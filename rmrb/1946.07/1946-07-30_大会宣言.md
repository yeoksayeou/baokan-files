　　Congress Declaration:
    People of the liberated areas, take action to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive! People of the whole country, take action to stop the civil war and stop the terror! People of China and the United States, unite to oppose American military intervention!

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th dispatch] "Declaration of the Yan'an People's Anti-Civil War and Anti-Espionage Congress," the full text is as follows:

    We, the people of Yan'an City, are gathering today to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive against the liberated areas and the Chiang Kai-shek agents' slaughter of the people!

    Since the ceasefire order, Chiang Kai-shek's army has never ceased its offensive against the liberated areas, and recently this offensive has been further expanded. Chiang Kai-shek's army began a large-scale offensive against the Eyu liberated area and the Jiaoji line of the Shandong liberated area at the end of June, a large-scale offensive against the Jin-Southwest liberated area in early July, and a large-scale offensive against the western, southern, and northern lines of the Su-Wan liberated area in mid-July. In Rehe, Chahar and other liberated areas, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is being actively prepared, and the war is developing into a national scale.

    Since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies have never ceased their slaughter of the people. Chiang Kai-shek created the Chongqing Jiaochangkou Massacre and the Xinhua Daily Massacre in February, the Harbin Li Zhaolin Massacre and the Nantong Massacre in March, the Beijing Zhongshan Park Massacre and the Xi'an Wang Ren Massacre in April, the Xianyang Li Furin Massacre in May, and the Nanjing Xiaguan Massacre and the Xuzhou Massacre in June. After countless terrorist incidents, in mid-July, he successively assassinated Mr. Li Gongpu and Professor Wen Yiduo, leaders of the Democratic League, in Kunming. In the liberated areas, thousands of people have been assassinated by secret agents since February.

    We are determined not to allow Chiang Kai-shek to fight and kill indiscriminately throughout the country, acting lawlessly; we demand that the people of the whole country unite to effectively stop the civil war and stop the terrorist acts of the secret service agencies; we must support the Eyu liberated area, the Shandong liberated area, the Jin-South liberated area, and the Su-Wan liberated area, and we must crush the reactionary military offensive; we must support the people of the whole country's movement to fight for peace, democracy, and survival, and we must crush the reactionary policy of terror and avenge the martyred heroes! Our struggle is just, and our struggle is bound to be victorious!

    We ask the American people and the democratic elements in the American government to correct the erroneous policy of the American government in aiding Chiang Kai-shek, because aiding Chiang Kai-shek is to expand the civil war and terror in China, to participate in the massacre of the Chinese people, and to violate the decision of the Moscow Three-Power Conference in December last year. We, the Chinese people, attach great importance to the friendly and equal cooperation between the two major nations of China and the United States, and are willing to make every effort for this. However, Chiang Kai-shek exchanges China's territorial, airspace, territorial waters, customs, inland rivers and other sovereignty for the military intervention of American reactionaries, and exchanges the United States for being caught in the vortex of the Chinese civil war. This is by no means supporting but destroying this friendly and equal cooperation.

    People of the whole liberated area, take action! Crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!
    People of the whole country, take action! Stop the civil war and stop the terror!
    Support the ceasefire order! Support the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference! Clean up the warmongers! Clean up the fascists! Dissolve the secret service agencies!
    People of China and the United States, unite! Oppose American military intervention! Establish friendly and equal cooperation between the two major nations of China and the United States!
    Long live the independent, peaceful, and democratic New China!

    Yan'an People's Anti-Civil War and Anti-Espionage Congress, July 26th, 35th year of the Republic of China.

　　大会宣言：
    解放区人民行动起来，粉碎蒋介石进攻！全国人民行动起来，制止内战制止恐怖！中美人民联合起来，反对美国军事干涉！
    【新华社延安二十七日电】“延安市各界反内战反特务大会宣言”，全文如下：
    我们延安市的人民，今天集会来反对蒋介石军队对于解放区的进攻，和蒋介石特务对于人民的屠杀！
    蒋介石的军队从停战令以来，就没有停止过对于解放区的进攻，最近这种进攻是更加扩大了。蒋介石的军队从六月底开始，大举进攻鄂豫解放区和山东解放区的胶济沿线，七月初大举进攻晋西南解放区，七月中旬又开始大举进攻苏皖解放区的西线、南线和北线。在热河、察哈尔和其他解放区，蒋介石的进攻正在积极准备，战争正在发展为全国的规模。
    蒋介石的特务机关从政治协商会议闭幕以来，就没有停止过对于人民的屠杀。蒋介石在制造了二月的重庆较场口惨案和新华日报惨案，三月的哈尔滨李兆麟惨案和南通惨案，四月的北平中山公园惨案和西安王任惨案，五月的咸阳李敷仁惨案，六月的南京下关惨案和徐州惨案等无数恐怖事件以后，七月中旬又在昆明连续暗杀了民主同盟的领导人物李公朴先生和闻一多教授。在解放区，从二月以来，已有几千人被特务暗杀。
    我们决心不许蒋介石这样在全国乱打乱杀，无法无天；我们要求全国人民联合起来，有效地制止内战，制止特务机关的恐怖行为；我们一定要声援鄂豫解放区、山东解放区、晋南解放区、和苏皖解放区，一定要粉碎反动派的军事进攻；我们一定要声援全国人民争和平争民主争生存的运动，一定要粉碎反动派的恐怖政策，为死难的烈士复仇！我们的奋斗是正义的，我们的奋斗必然要得到胜利！
    我们要求美国人民和美国政府中的民主分子，起来纠正美国政府援助蒋介石的错误政策，因为援助蒋介石就是扩大中国的内战和恐怖，就是参与屠杀中国人民，就是违反去年十二月莫斯科三国会议的决定。我们中国人民十分重视中美两大民族的友谊平等合作，愿意为此作一切的努力，但是蒋介石以出卖中国领土、领空、领海、海关、内河和其他主权，来换取美国反动分子的军事干涉，换取美国陷入中国内战的漩涡，这决不是拥护而是破坏这种友谊平等合作。
    全解放区的人民行动起来！粉碎蒋介石的进攻！
    全国的人民行动起来！制止内战制止恐怖！
    拥护停战令！拥护政协决议！清洗好战分子！清洗法西斯分子！解散特务机关！
    中美人民联合起来！反对美国军事干涉！建立中美两大民族的友谊平等合作！
    独立和平民主的新中国万岁！
    延安各界反内战反特务大会，中华民国三十五年七月二十六日。
