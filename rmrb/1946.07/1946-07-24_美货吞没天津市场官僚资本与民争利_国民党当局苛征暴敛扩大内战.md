Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: Tianjin News: American goods are engulfing the market here, not only making it impossible for domestic products to compete, but also leading to the collapse of the British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company, which has 98 cigarette-making machines. The company ceased operations on the 14th. "Prohibited" imported luxury goods, cosmetics, American perfumes, lipsticks, and other foreign goods are flooding the market here. Because compradors are doing a large import business and hoarding imported goods for speculation, import orders have become valuable securities in the financial market, being transferred among people engaged in the import business. Small-capital importers are eager to sell, so import orders are eventually concentrated in the hands of big comprador bosses within the Kuomintang. Steel, bicycles, soda ash, textiles, etc., are also in an unprecedented crisis due to the influx of American goods. The price of domestic products is much higher than that of American goods. American steel costs less than two million yuan per ton, while the production cost of Tianjin Steel Plant is three million yuan. American soda ash costs less than 32,000 yuan per 90-kilogram bag, including a 15% tariff, while Yongli Chemical Plant's product costs 30,000 yuan per 80-kilogram bag, and its quality is much worse than American goods. An American bicycle costs only 30 US dollars, while a Chinese product costs 75 US dollars. American cotton with fibers as long as three inches costs only 100,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), while domestic cotton with fibers only one inch long costs 400,000 yuan. According to people in the textile industry, the large-scale import of American cloth will put the Chinese textile industry in an irreparable situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Tianjin News: The Kuomintang authorities have recently distributed all of the more than 300 large and small factories "taken over" in Tianjin to the military, political, and military command departments for their possession, converting them into "state-owned" enterprises. Private industrialists are launching a private industrial self-rescue movement to survive.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Shanghai News: Because the Kuomintang authorities' military expenses for the civil war are huge, they are imposing heavy taxes on Shanghai merchants, with tax rates as high as 60%, plus a 20% income tax, totaling 80%. It is reported that Shanghai's tax revenue has reached half of the country's total (including 55% of the goods tax and 50% of the direct income tax), and the business income tax for the 34th year is still being pursued. Various industry trade unions and the municipal chamber of commerce have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance for exemption last month, but all were rejected.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 20th: In order to expand the civil war, Chiang's troops in various parts of eastern Hebei are currently collecting grain and taxes everywhere, and even openly plundering. In Shunyi, Tongxian and other places, wheat is collected at rates of 10 to 20 catties per mu, and some even collect 1 to 2 dou of miscellaneous grains per mu. One rifle is collected for every 50 mu of land, and a certain amount of corn is collected, and if poor households do not have enough, they must buy bullets with 17 catties of corn per mu. One soldier must be provided for every seven qing of land, and an average of 1,000 yuan per mu must be paid for "bunker construction fees," with large villages providing eight workers per day and small villages providing five workers. "Welcome fees" must be paid to welcome Kuomintang officers, averaging 200 yuan per mu. In Changli County, there is also a "land income tax," which is 50% of the land price. Kuomintang Shunyi County Magistrate Wang (a traitor), led the puppet security team and 1,700 Chiang's troops, not only robbed 677 shi of grain from this county on June 17th and 18th, but also robbed 469 shi from neighboring counties such as Sanhe, Wuqing, and Tongxian. On June 20th, the stubborn troops of Ninghe and Lutai surrounded the village of Hougoudigu, and robbed 120 head of livestock in one fell swoop. All the surplus grain and new grain of every family in the 140 households in the whole village was robbed, filling seven large carts. Before leaving, they said to the masses: "Each head of livestock must be redeemed for one million yuan." According to a survey of 20 villages in Lulong, Chiang's troops robbed more than 30,000 jin of grain, and the stubborn troops of Fengnan robbed more than 20 large carts of new wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to Shanghai newspapers, there have recently been several shocking corruption cases in Kuomintang governments at all levels. Yu Xiangyan, wife of the chief of the materials section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, instructed Zhang Bokang, the chief of the purchasing section, and others to make a large number of clothes for employees of the two railways. Each set only cost 20,000 yuan, but the section paid 30,000 yuan, embezzling more than 120 million yuan. Xi Zhihe, director of the Jialing Branch of the Sichuan Grain Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Food, embezzled more than 500 million yuan of grain funds with evidence. Lu Wugong, the county magistrate of Hefei, Anhui, imposed excessive donations from the people and embezzled 500 million yuan of public funds. Even a township head in Zhejiang—Shi Taishan, the head of Jiaxing Lirentownship—illegally collected 7,000 shi of grain (at 50,000 yuan per shi, totaling 350 million yuan in legal tender), plus more than 2 million yuan in legal tender. The total amount of corruption in the above four cases is about 1.5 billion yuan.

　　美货吞没天津市场官僚资本与民争利
    国民党当局苛征暴敛扩大内战
    【新华社北平十九日电】天津讯：美货吞没此间市场，不仅使国产品无法与之竞争，而且连拥有制烟机九十八台之英商贻中烟草公司亦垮台，该公司已于十四日停工。“禁止”进口的奢侈品、化妆品、美国香水、口红等外货竟充斥此间市场。由于买办们大作进口生意，并将进口货囤积，进行投机，进口货的定单，竟在金融市场上成为有价证券，在各个做进口生意的人们手中互相转脱。一般本钱小的进口商，急于脱售，从而进口货的定单，终于集中于国民党内大买办老板们之手。钢铁、自行车、纯碱、纺织等，亦因美货潮涌而来，处在空前危机中。国产品价格远高于美货，美货钢铁每吨不到二百万元，而天津钢铁厂出品的成本则需三百万元。美货纯碱每袋九十公斤，加百分之十五的关税，不上三万二千元，而永利化学厂出品每袋才八十公斤，市价即达三万元，其质量又远差于美货。美货自行车一辆仅需美金三十元，而我国产品合美金七十五元。纤维长达三寸的美棉，每担只需十万元，而土产的纤维仅一寸长的棉花，却需四十万元。据纺织界人士谈：美国布匹大量进口，中国纺织业将陷于不可挽救之境。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】天津讯：国民党当局顷将在津“接收”之三百余家大小工厂全部分给军政、军令等部占有，改为“国营”。民营工业家正发起民营工业自救运动，以谋生存。

    【新华社张家口二十日电】冀东区各地蒋军为扩大内战，近正向各地征粮征税，甚至公开抢掠。在顺义、通县等地征收麦子，每亩地有征收十斤到二十斤的，甚至有每亩地征一斗至二斗杂粮者。每五十亩地征步枪一枝，玉米若干石，如贫户不足数者，则每亩地十七斤玉米买子弹。每七顷地要出一个兵，每亩地平均要出“建碉费”千元，每天大村出八个工，小村出五个工。迎接国民党军官要出“欢迎费”，每亩地平均二百元。在昌黎县，还有“土地所得税”，即按地价收百分之五十的税。国民党顺义王县长（汉奸）带领伪保安队及蒋军一千七百多人，在六月十七、十八两天，不仅在本县抢去粮食六百七十七石，而且在邻县——三河、武清、通县等县抢去四百六十九石。宁河、芦台顽军，六月二十日包围后沟棣沽村，一次抢去牲口一二○头，全村一四○户，每家余粮新粮全抢光，共装大车七辆。临走向群众说：“每头牲口要一百万元才能赎回”。又据卢龙二十个村庄的调查，被蒋军抢去粮食三万余斤，丰南顽军抢去新麦二十余大车。
    【新华社延安十九日电】据沪报透露国民党各级政府中近又出现数惊人贪污案，京沪区铁路管理局材料处长之妻郁香严指使采购课长张伯康等，替两路员工制办大批服装，每套仅需二万元，而该课竟付三万元，贪污达一万万二千余万元，粮食部四川粮食储运局嘉陵区分局长奚致和，侵吞粮款有据者即达五万万元以上。安徽合肥县长陆武功，苛派民捐，私吞公款达五万万元。甚至浙江的一个乡长——嘉兴里仁乡长石泰山，浮收粮食亦达七千石（以五万元一石计，共合法币三万万五千万元），另法币二百余万元。以上四案贪污数目，共约十五万万元。
