Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party announced on June 6 the results of its efforts to solve the food problem, stating that reactionary governments often say that the Communist Party only knows how to mobilize the people to oppose all policies arbitrarily. In reality, the Communist Party uses mass mobilization to implement the demands of the masses. One clear result is that in Tokyo, mobilizing 20,000 people to carry out 45 struggles resulted in obtaining the right to supervise the government's management of national food supplies, making the government's grain depots publicize figures. Furthermore, a Citizens' Food Management Committee was organized to democratically manage the emergency rice allocated to Tokyo citizens. The hoarding and speculation by unmanaged zaibatsu landlords were exposed. On one hand, small producers and consumers were directly connected, obtaining 78,000 kan of fish (one kan equals 6.4 Chinese pounds). Regarding the movement for local farmers to obtain rice, farmers' struggles were launched in 22 districts, enabling farmers to obtain grain, fertilizer, etc. As a result of carrying out struggles by exposure teams (to report hidden grain), a total of 3,500 kan of rice (one kan equals 110 Chinese pounds), 62,220 kan of salt, and 16,856 kan of sugar were discovered in Tokyo alone, hidden by zaibatsu landlords. In addition, there were barley, wheat, cotton cloth, linen, fertilizer, etc. All the above items were transferred to people's organizations for management and distribution to the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Tokyo dispatch: The famous Waseda University has now completed democratic reform. The university held a public election for president on June 11, and Dr. Tsuda Sokichi was elected. Tanaka Hozumi, known for his conservatism, has been dismissed. Tsuda is a liberal scholar who deeply supports the democratic front movement. Tanaka had been president of Waseda for 20 years, sparing no effort in assisting the Emperor system's education system. Waseda has long been a well-known liberal school, playing a significant role in the history of the democratic movement. Since the military's surrender, many professors and a large number of students at the university have actively participated in democratic activities. In the student self-government conference on May 29, the students unanimously passed proposals to report war criminal professors, strengthen the faculty, and demand that school funding be borne by the national treasury, and negotiated with the school authorities and the government. Waseda University is known in the Far East as a school of journalism and is one of Japan's three major universities.

　　日共领导粮食斗争东京群众生活改善
    早稻田大学实行民主改革
    【新华社延安十日电】东京讯：日本共产党于六月六日发表为解决粮食问题而努力之成果称：反动政府常谓共产党仅知发动民众任意反对一切政策，实则共产党以大众发动贯彻大众要求，其成果之明显者，如在东京地方动员两万人，进行四十五件斗争之结果，遂获得对政府管理全国粮食的监视权，使政府所属粮库公开数字，又组织市民粮食管理委员会，对拨给东京市民的应急米，加以民主管理。对未受管理的财阀地主的囤积居奇，则加以揭发，一面使小生产者与消费者直接联系，获得鱼类七万八千贯（每贯合中国六斤四两）。关于地方农民获得饭米运动，在二十二地区展开农民斗争的结果，使农民均获得粮食肥料等。农民由于开展揭发队（检举隐藏粮食）的斗争，在东京一地共发现了财阀地主隐藏米三千五百贯（每贯合中国一百一十斤），盐六万二千二百二十贯，糖一万六千八百五十六贯，外有大麦、小麦、棉布、麻布、肥料等。以上各物，均移交人民团体管理，分配给人民。
    【新华社延安十日电】东京讯：著名的早稻田大学现已完成民主改革，该校于六月十一日举行校长公选，津田左右吉博士当选，以保守著称的田中穗积已被罢黜。津田为自由主义学者，对民主阵线运动深为赞助。田中执长早大有二十年，对天皇制教育制度的襄助不遗余力。早稻田向为闻名的自由主义学校，在民主运动史上，曾起过很多作用。军部投降以来，该校很多教授与广大学生，即积极参加民主活动。在五月二十九日的学生自治大会中，学生们一致通过检举战犯教授，强化教授阵容，要求学资由国库负担等提案，向学校当局与政府交涉。早大学课以新闻学者称于远东，为日本三大名校之一。
