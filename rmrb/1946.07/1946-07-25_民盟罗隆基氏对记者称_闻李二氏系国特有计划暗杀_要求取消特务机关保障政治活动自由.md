Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd Dispatch: Nanjing News: Luo Longji and Liang Shuming, both Standing Committee members of the China Democratic League, held a press conference yesterday afternoon regarding the assassinations of League Central Committee members Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo in Kunming by KMT (Kuomintang) secret agents. Luo Longji reported the facts of the Li and Wen tragedies. Luo stated: The two Lis were assassinated by KMT agents in a planned operation, and the KMT authorities clearly failed to fulfill their responsibility to protect their safety. Luo then demanded that the KMT authorities immediately abolish secret service agencies, guarantee the freedom of legal political activities for all parties, and advocated a swift and thorough investigation into the truth of the two cases. He also proposed that the China Democratic League send personnel to participate in the investigation and legal experts to participate in the trial, so that the truth of the tragedy could be made public. Liang Shuming reiterated Luo's demands in his speech.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st Dispatch: Shanghai News: Democratic figures here have expressed indignation at the brutal assassinations of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu by KMT secret agents and demanded that an investigation team be organized from representatives of all parties and non-party representatives of the Political Consultative Conference to go to Kunming to thoroughly investigate the truth of the two cases and severely punish the murderers. Regarding the KMT authorities' dispatch of Tang Bai, the director of the Police Department, to Kunming on the 17th to investigate the two cases, the general public believes that the assassins of Wen and Li were KMT agents, and Tang Bai was a notorious henchman of the KMT's Restoration secret service chief Dai Li (deceased). Sending him to investigate the two cases means that the grievances of the deceased will never be redressed.

　　民盟罗隆基氏对记者称
    闻李二氏系国特有计划暗杀
    要求取消特务机关保障政治活动自由
    【新华社延安二十二电】南京讯：民主同盟中常委罗隆基、梁漱溟二氏，于昨日下午为该盟中委李公朴、闻一多先后在昆为国民党特务暗杀事举行记者招待会，由罗隆基报告李闻二惨案经过事实，罗氏称：李闻二氏系遭国民党特务有计划之暗杀，国民党当局显然未负起保护彼等安全之责任。罗氏继即要求国民党当局立即取消特务机关，保障各党派合法政治活动之自由，并主张对二案迅即彻查真相，同时应由民盟方面派员参加调查，并派法科专家参加审判，使惨案真相公诸社会。梁漱溟氏于发言中，重申罗氏主张。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪讯：此间民主人士对闻一多、李公朴两氏惨遭国民党特务暗杀，均表愤慨，并要求由政协会各党派及无党派代表中组织一调查团，前往昆明彻查两案真相，严惩凶手。对国民党当局于十七日派遣警察总署署长唐白赴昆调查两案一事，一般人士认为暗杀闻李两氏者为国民党特务，而唐白又为臭名昭著的国民党复兴特务头子（已故）戴笠手下的大红人，今派彼调查两案，死者冤屈，永无昭雪之可能。
