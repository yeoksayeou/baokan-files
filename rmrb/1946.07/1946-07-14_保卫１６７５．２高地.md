    Standing on Highland 1675.2, the sentry of the 304th Unit, in the posture of a defender of peace and democracy, holds a "Type 38" rifle with a bayonet, watching the stubborn puppet troops in Nanguan—the destroyers of peace and democracy—like an eagle. He guards the liberated areas of Qi and Wu as if protecting his own eyes.
    Highland 1675.2 is located five li northeast of Nanguan on the Baijin Road. Below it are Zhaishang and Shizhuang villages. In front of the villages is the railway, and it is only five or six li away from Beiguan in the north. On the mountain opposite to the south is the Yan army's blockhouse—with Japanese soldiers as gunners and machine gunners, and armed with Japanese weapons. On the east slope of the blockhouse is Liu Bei Village, and at the foot of the mountain on the west slope is Nanguan Town. To the east, due north, and due south are the liberated areas of Qi and Wu, which have been repeatedly ravaged by enemy, puppet, and stubborn forces. Highland 1675.2 is a commanding height of great significance, the throat of the railway from Nanguan to Beiguan on the Baijin Road. This highland is 1675.2 meters above sea level.
            Two
    At 10:00 AM on April 23rd, it had already been three months and ten days since the announcement of the nationwide ceasefire order in China. The three regiments of Japanese puppet Yan troops entrenched in Nanguan Town, with two Japanese steel cannons and more than thirty light and heavy machine guns, using Japanese gunners and machine gunners, began to invade Highland 1675.2 again!
    "Report! Report to the battalion commander, the enemy has begun to move from Liu Bei Village!" The sentry watched the enemy intently and reported loudly to his battalion commander.
    The telephone on Highland 1675.2 rang. The "304" headquarters received the order:
    "Hello! Is that Commander × of the battalion? If the enemy dares to invade our position, we must resolutely eliminate them. I have ordered the artillery company to climb the mountain immediately, occupy the position and cooperate with you. Regardless of the cost, we must defend the position to the death!" The regimental commander conveyed his firm determination to his troops.
    After Commander × of the battalion repeated the regimental commander's order over the phone, he said to himself: "Yes! We must resolutely defend Highland 1675.2, and swear to coexist with the position. Immediately deploy the troops." Then, he ordered each company to immediately enter the position, and repeatedly said: "Do not open fire prematurely without orders! Prepare the grenades!"
    The atmosphere on Highland 1675.2 became tense. The communication soldiers were busy conveying orders, the artillery observers were constantly observing the enemy, and the political instructor was busy checking the positions of his company, platoon, machine gunners, and grenade throwers. The soldiers said with excitement: "Let the lackeys come, and give them black bread to eat! (referring to grenades)"
    Special-class shooter Li Erhai proposed "guaranteeing to kill two enemy commanders." Squad Leader Wang said: "We're going to change our guns today!" "Our forward哨排guarantees that the enemy will not be allowed to rush up, and will be sent rolling back!" This was the challenging voice from the first platoon of the eighth company.
    The political instructor was busy verbally conveying the determination of each squad and platoon, and the news of victory.
    "Comrades, the ×× Brigade at He Shangtou in the north has repelled the attacking enemy, eliminating a company of them, and capturing three machine guns!" The news of victory spread to every bunker on Highland 1675.2.
    At 11:05 AM, the three regiments of enemy troops in Nanguan had all moved to gather near the Liu Bei blockhouse. The distance was only two li. The mountain opposite was the enemy, separated only by a ditch.
    The enemy began to descend into the ditch, moving timidly towards the direction of our army's position on the eastern mountain! The enemy's artillery had begun to fire wildly at our position! The regimental leader ordered:
    "Artillery company! Begin firing at the enemy's dense formation, three rounds in a row!"
    The artillery heroes showed their great power. The first shell landed behind the enemy's formation, less than two meters away. The second shell landed in the enemy's formation, and the enemy hugged their heads and scurried around like ants in a hot pot.
    "Well done! Well done!" The soldiers cheered and jumped up from the fortifications. The political instructor shouted loudly, telling everyone to pay attention to cover.
    "Artillery! Fire again." ... A series of shells landed in the enemy's formation, and they crawled, afraid to move, waiting for our punishment like criminals!
    Soon the enemy began to charge the highland in two directions.
    The enemy soldiers dared not rush forward. The commander holding the white flag was hitting them from behind. Sharpshooter Li Erhai saw it most clearly. "Bang!" With one shot, the commander and the white flag rolled into the gully together.
    Immediately, "Li Erhai shot and killed an enemy commander!" This news spread to every single-person bunker.
    The regimental leader carefully observed the enemy's movement with binoculars, and saw that most of the enemy were moving into the left-side ditch. There was a cannon and two heavy machine guns on the south mountain covering the charge, but the enemy in the front had already begun to charge upwards ... He saw this situation and quickly made a judgment and determination: "The enemy's frontal attack is a feint, and the main force is on the left side, attempting to attack from the left side, occupy the front hill, and cut off our retreat." So he immediately sent the × battalion to reinforce the left side. Another battalion rushed along the ditch to the enemy's rear, eliminating a force of them and attacking from above and below! Victory was assured. His judgment and determination were transmitted to each battalion by telephone. Sure enough, the enemy's main force gradually moved to the left side, and had already climbed the mountain. The cannons and machine guns on the south mountain were firing like rain. The artillery fire destroyed the fortifications of our forward positions, but our soldiers did not fire a single shot. The enemy thought we had "run away," so they swaggered upwards. The distance was only fifty meters. Platoon Leader Li ordered the soldiers in the fortifications to "throw grenades!"
    A volley of grenades hit the enemy's formation like hailstones, and they rolled down the gully like dead pigs. This was the enemy's first charge.
    Then the second, the third, the fourth ... it was all the same.
    At 2:00 PM, the enemy, in a fit of rage, brought out all three regiments and launched the final "general attack!" We made a simple mobilization of the × battalion reserve team. "Defend the position to the death, and do not let the enemy occupy a single bunker!" This slogan became the actual action at that time.
    Two regiments of the enemy attacked from the left side, and one regiment feigned an attack in the front. The enemy's cannons and machine guns fired non-stop. The three routes from the left side charged upwards. However, our battalion that was attacking from the rear rushed out of the ditch like the wind to the enemy's rear. The soldiers guarding the hilltop saw this situation, and Fifth Company Commander Han Yishan stood up, holding a grenade, and led the soldiers to throw them down. "Grenades are really useful!" He shouted happily while fighting! After repelling one route, the remaining two routes of the enemy prepared to retreat, but how could the heroes of the First Battalion let them go? They had already cut off their return route. Another burst of grenades made it difficult for the enemy to advance or retreat, and they crawled on the hillside. The × battalion on the mountain counter-attacked, with bayonets fixed, and charged straight to the enemy. "Kill!", "Kill!" ... The two regiments of the enemy were defeated, and one regiment was eliminated. The corpses alone numbered more than two hundred! Highland 1675.2 was still firmly defended by us!
            Three
    At dusk, the enemy reinforced Nanguan with another regiment from the south ditch. Its forward battalion forcibly occupied the salient defended by our Taiyue troops—the salient at the southwestern foot of Highland 1675.2.
    "The 304th Unit must find a way to encircle and annihilate the enemy in the salient of the highland with swift and secret action before 12:00 tonight, and annihilate them all!" The new task was transmitted from the telephone to Highland 1675.2. Some companies had been fighting all day and had not yet eaten. After the battle ended, the soldiers' hungry stomachs had begun to rumble. The First Company, which was publicly recognized as the main force during the day, was just about to prepare for a meal when Political Instructor Ma began to seriously convey the new task.
    "That's right! Completing the task is the most important thing. To protect the interests of the people, and to protect the liberated areas, we can eat after the fight!"
    "Winning the battle is more important than eating!"
    "This is a good opportunity to compete with the Fourth Company for guns!" After Political Instructor Ma finished speaking, the soldiers spontaneously put forward these slogans. The troops advanced in the dim night!
    The grenade throwers of the First Company's commando group, with their rifles on their backs, each carrying five grenades around their waists, arrived at the foot of the salient with swift and secret movements. The soldiers crawled with their hands as feet, and the enemy sentries did not notice at all. They were only fifty meters away from the enemy. Squad Leader Liu Shuangkui saw that the enemy's machine gun jackets had not yet been taken off. He thought to himself: "Let's start! I want to seize two machine guns first!" He was already in front of the enemy sentries. "Who! What are you doing? Password!" The answer was a burst of black bread (grenades). The enemy's twelve machine guns only fired one burst of bullets before our bayonets were pressed against their chests. In just thirty-five minutes, the enemy's forward battalion was completely eliminated! Of the twelve machine guns, except for three that rolled down the cliff, the rest were captured by us.
    Squad Leader Liu Shuangkui obtained three machine guns all by himself. The First Battalion of the 304th Unit gloriously completed the "task of annihilating the enemy in the salient of the highland."
    Now, the sentry of the 304th Unit standing on Highland 1675.2 often sings with a victorious smile: --
    "Wherever the enemy attacks from, we will eliminate them there!"

　　保卫１６７５．２高地
　　洛夫
            一
    站立在１６７５．２高地上的三○四部队的哨兵，以和平、民主保卫者的姿态，拿着“三八”式带刺刀的枪，鹰似的注视着南关的顽伪军——和平、民主的破坏者。他如同保护自己的眼睛一样，守卫着祁、武一带的解放区。
    １６７５．２高地，在白晋路南关东北面五里地的地方，它下边就是寨上和史庄村，村前是铁路，北离北关也只有五、六里地，南面对面山就是阎军碉堡——用日本人作炮手、机枪射手，同时又为日本武器武装起来的碉堡。碉堡东坡是刘背村，西坡山下是南关镇，东面，正北，正南，都是敌伪顽再三蹂躏过的祁、武解放区，１６７５．２高地是一个有重要意义的制高点，是白晋路南关到北关铁路的咽喉，这个高地离地平面有１６７５．２公尺。
            二
    四月二十三日上午十时，已经是中国全面和平停战命令公布后的三个月零十天了。盘据在南关镇的日伪阎军三个团，附日本钢炮两门，轻重机枪卅余挺，使用着日本炮手与机枪手，又开始向１６７５．２高地进犯了！
    “报告！报告营长，敌人已开始从刘背村移动了！”哨兵目不转睛地监视着敌人，高声报告给自己的营长。
    １６７５．２高地的电话铃响了，“三○四”本部接到了命令：
    “喂！×营长吗？如果敌人敢于向我们阵地进犯，我们要坚决消灭它，我已命令炮兵连马上爬山，占领阵地配合你们，不顾牺牲代价多少，要死守阵地！”团长把斩钉截铁一样的决心，传给自己部队。
    ×营长在电话里复诵了团长命令之后，自言自语着：“是的！我们要坚决保卫１６７５．２高地，誓与阵地共存亡，马上布置队伍。”接着，命令各连立刻进入阵地，并再三的说：“没有命令不得过早开枪！手榴弹准备好！”
    １６７５．２高地的空气紧张起来了，通讯员忙着传达命令，炮兵观测手不停止的观察敌人，指导员忙着检查自己的连、排、机枪手、手榴弹手的位置。战士们带着激昂的情绪说着：“叫他狗腿们来，给他黑面包吃！（指手榴弹）”
    特等射手李二孩提出“保证要打死敌人两个指挥官。”王班长说：“我们今天要换一换枪！”“我们前哨排保证不让敌人冲上来，叫他滚回去！”这是八连一排传来的挑战声音。
    指导员，忙着用口头传达各班排的决心，和胜利消息。
    “同志们，北面河上头××旅把进攻的敌人打退了，消灭它一个连，得了三挺机枪！”胜利消息传遍了１６７５．２高地的每个工事里。
    上午，十一时零五分，南关敌人三个团，都运动到刘背碉堡的附近集结着。距离只有二里地，对面山就是敌人，当中只隔一道沟。
    敌人开始下沟，向东山我军阵地的方向懦动了！敌人的炮兵，已向我们阵地疯狂的射击！团首长命令着：
    “炮兵连！向敌人密集队形开始射击，连三发！”
    炮兵英雄大显神威，第一炮，弹落到敌人队伍的后边，不到二公尺远，第二炮，弹落到敌人的队伍里，敌人狠狠地抱着头乱窜，好像热窝里的蚂蚁一样。
    “打得好！打得好！”战士们从工事欢呼着高兴的跳起来，指导员高声喊着叫大家注意掩蔽。
    “炮兵！再打。”……………一连串的炮弹落在敌人队伍里，他们爬着不敢动，好像罪人一样等着我们惩罚它！
    不久敌人开始分两路向高地冲锋了。
    敌人的士兵不敢向前冲，拿着白旗的指挥官在后面打着他们，神枪手李二孩看得最清楚。“嘣！”的一枪，那指挥官与白旗一同滚到山沟里。
    即刻，“李二孩一枪打死一个敌人指挥官！”这个消息，传到每一个单人掩体里。
    团首长，用望远镜细密地观察敌人运动，看到大部分敌人都往左侧沟里运动，南山上有一门炮，两挺重机枪掩护冲锋，但，正面敌人已开始往上冲了………………。他看到这个情况，很快下了判断与决心：“敌人正面是佯攻，主力是在左侧，企图从左侧进攻，占领前面山头，截断我们的后路。”于是立即把×营增援到左侧面。另一个营顺着沟，扑到敌人的屁股后面去，消灭它一股，上下夹击！胜利是有把握的。他的判断与决心，用电话传到各营里去。果然，敌人主力逐渐移到左侧方，并已上山，南山的炮与机枪如雨点般发射着，炮火把我们前沿阵地工事都破坏了，但，我们的战士一枪不发，敌人以为我们“跑啦”，于是大摇大摆往上冲，距离只有五十米达了，李排长命令：工事里的战士们“投手榴弹！”
    一排子手榴弹，如冰雹一样打到敌人的队伍里，它们都像死猪似的滚下山沟。这是敌人第一次冲锋。
    接着第二次，第三次第四次………………都是同样。
    下午二时，敌人老羞成怒，把三个团都拿出来，发动最后一次“总攻击！”我们把×营预备队作了简单动员，“死守阵地，不让敌人占领一个山堡！”这句口号，就变为当时的实际行动。
    敌人两个团从左侧攻，一个团在正面佯攻，敌人的炮和机枪不停的发射，从左侧分三路冲上来了。然而，我们抄后路的一个营，像风一样从沟里扑到敌人的后方，守山头的战士，看到这情形，五连长韩义山，站起来拿着手榴弹率领战士往下投。“手榴弹真顶事呀！”他一面打一面高兴地呼喊着！打退了一路，其余两路敌人准备退走了，可是一营的英雄们，那肯让他走呢？早已把他们的归路切断，又是一阵子手榴弹，打得敌人进退两难，爬在半山坡。山上的×营反冲锋，上着刺刀，一直冲到敌人跟前，“杀！”，“杀！”……………敌人两个团被打垮了，一个团被消灭了，光掉下的尸首就有两百多具！１６７５．２高地仍然为我们坚守着！
            三
    黄昏，敌人又从南沟增援到南关一个团，它以一个前哨营，强占我太岳部队防守的突出部——就是１６７５．２高地的西南山脚下的突出部。
    “三○四部队，在今晚十二时以前，要设法以迅速秘密的行动，围歼高地突出部的敌人，要全部歼灭他！”新的任务又从电话里传到１６７５．２高地。有些连队打了一天仗还没吃上饭，战斗结束后，战士们的肚里，饿肠已开始雷鸣。被大家在白天公认为主力的一连，正要准备吃饭，麻指导员开始严肃地传达新的任务。
    “对的！完成任务要紧，保卫人民利益，保卫解放区打完再吃饭也行！”
    “打胜仗比吃饭要紧！”
    “这是与四连比赛得枪的好机会！”麻指导员讲完话后，战士们自动提出了这些口号。部队在夜色茫茫中前进着！
    一连的突击组投弹手，大背着枪，每人腰里带着五颗手榴弹，以迅速秘密的动作，到达了突出部的山根，战士们，用双手当成脚爬行着，敌人哨兵一点没有发觉。和敌人只隔五十米达了，六班长刘双奎看到敌人的机枪衣还没有脱下，他心里想：“开始干吧！我首先要夺两挺机枪！”已经到敌人哨兵跟前了，“谁！干什么的？口令！”回答是一阵黑面包（手榴弹），敌人十二挺机枪，只打了一梭子弹，我们的刺刀就逼上他们的胸膛。仅仅花了三十五分钟的功夫，敌人的前哨营全部被消灭了！十二挺机枪，除了三挺滚到绝崖底下之外，其余都被我们缴获了。
    六班长刘双奎，一个人得了三挺机枪。三○四部队的第一营，光荣地完成了“歼灭高地突出部敌人的任务。”
    现在，１６７５．２高地上，站立着的三○四部队的哨兵，时常带着胜利微笑唱着：——
    “敌人从那里进攻，叫他消灭在那里！”
