　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: A special dispatch from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao in Guangzhou on the 10th of July stated: "The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters has been ordered to concentratively train over 700 members of the CCP's Dongjiang armed forces for three months, after which formal demobilization certificates will be issued. The Pacification Headquarters is currently making plans for this." Note: The eighth executive group of the Peiping Executive Headquarters has already issued a public announcement regarding the demobilization of 781 CCP personnel remaining in Guangdong, notifying the local government to provide guarantees. The Kuomintang's sudden proposal of a concentration camp-style so-called intensive training is truly astonishing! Although the CCP's anti-Japanese armed forces in the Dongjiang and Beijiang regions of Guangdong have already withdrawn to Yantai, the CCP's armed forces on Hainan Island have not yet reached an agreement. The CCP is extremely concerned about the above two matters.

　　中共关怀华南武装
    国民党竟图集训复员人员海南岛我军迄今未能撤退
    【新华社延安十九日电】七月十三日天津大公报广州十日专电称：“中共东江武装人员七百余名，广州行营奉命须将彼等集训三个月，然后发正式复员证，现行营正计划中”。按：北平执行部第八执行小组关于中共留粤复员人员七八一名之复员，早经发表公报，通知所在地政府保障。现国民党方面忽提出集中营式的所谓集训，实属令人惊异！广东东江北江中共抗日武装，虽已撤往烟台，但海南岛之中共武装迄今尚未获得协议，中共方面对上述二事极表关怀。
