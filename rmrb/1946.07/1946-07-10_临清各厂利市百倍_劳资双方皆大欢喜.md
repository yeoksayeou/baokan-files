　　【Report from Weixian by our newspaper】 Various factories in Linqing are making tremendous profits, to the delight of both labor and management. The sickle factory, with an original capital of 300,000 yuan, produced 36,000 sickles from the fifteenth day of the first month to the fifteenth day of the third month, earning a net profit of 1.55 million yuan. The Gongju Hosiery Factory, with a capital of 700,000 yuan, started operations at the end of February and, upon closing its accounts at the end of April, obtained a net profit of 670,000 yuan. Furthermore, due to the improvement of workers' lives and the amelioration of labor-management relations, the workers' morale is very high. For example, before liberation, eight workers at the Yihua Iron Factory made a total of eight bows in four months; after liberation, they made 48 bows in four months. This year, from January to March, they produced 36 bows in two months through a concentrated effort. The factory owner increased the workers' wages, and the workers responded to the factory owner with active production. Currently, the trade union is educating the workers to further increase their production quotas and to save money for investment in production.

　　临清各厂利市百倍
    劳资双方皆大欢喜
    【本报威县讯】临清市各种工厂利市百倍，劳资双方皆大欢喜。镰刀工厂原有资本卅万元从正月十五开工至三月十五止，出镰刀三万六千张，赚净利一百五十五万元公聚袜厂资本七十万，二月底开办，四月底结账得净利六十七万元。此外由于工人生活提高，劳资关系改善，工人生产情绪很高。如益华铁工厂有八个工人在未解放前，四个月中共做了八个洋弓；解放后，四个月中即做了四十八个弓，今年从正月到三月两月中，即突击三十六个弓。厂主给工人加资，工人以积极生产回答厂主，目前工会正教育工人，更多增加生产额率，省吃俭用投资生产。
