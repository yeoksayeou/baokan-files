　　Instructions from the Jiluyu Administrative Office to Various Regions:
    Pay Attention to Cultivating Women's Political Participation
    Telegram of Support from the Jinan Women's Federation to Shanghai Women
    [Heze News from this newspaper] On the 12th, the Jiluyu Administrative Office issued instructions to various special districts, counties, and cities regarding the issue of women's political participation, putting forward the following opinions: 1. We should adopt a positive and welcoming attitude towards women comrades coming to the government, and they must be assigned appropriate work and must not be demoted. 2. The requirements for female cadres should not be too high. They are new to government work and not yet familiar with it. We must help them gradually improve. 3. Special care must be taken for pregnant women and women comrades who are raising children on their own. The working hours should not be excessive, and there should be no dissatisfaction or contempt expressed because of their low work efficiency and many affairs. 4. Women comrades who come to work in the government from the military, party, civilian, armed forces, and academic systems should be given consideration in terms of rank, and should not be demoted in terms of use and treatment. 5. Responsible comrades at all levels and the civil affairs departments should regularly and systematically absorb and cultivate female cadres, and gradually improve their abilities and status, so that the issue of women's political participation can be genuinely realized.
    [Weixian News from this newspaper, 16th] The Jinan Women's Federation learned that 30,000 women in Shanghai had jointly written to Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Marshall, calling for peace. They sent a telegram of support, the original text of which is as follows: "Sisters of all circles in Shanghai: After seeing the news that 30,000 of you have jointly called for peace, the broad masses of women in Jinan are deeply excited and infinitely admire your righteous action. After enduring the ravages of war for a long time, the women of Jinan, like the people and women sisters all over the country, need a peaceful and stable life. Therefore, we fully agree with your position and resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries relying on American reactionaries to carry out civil war, and resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' dictatorship and autocracy. We are extremely willing to join hands with you and fight to the end for independence, democracy, and peace."

    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫行署于十二日向各专县市发出关于妇女参政问题的指示，提出以下意见：一、妇女同志到政府来应该采取积极欢迎的态度，并须分配适当工作，并不得降级使用。二、对妇女干部要求不应过高，她们刚到政府工作，还不熟悉，我们必须帮助她们逐渐进步。三、对孕妇及自养小孩之妇女同志，尤须特别照顾，在工作时间上，不能要求过多，更不得因她们工作效率低事情多，而表示不满与鄙视。四、由军、党、民、武、学等各系统到政府工作之妇女同志，在等级上应予以照顾，不得降级使用与待遇。五、各级负责同志及民政部门应经常有计划的吸收与培养妇女干部并逐渐提高其能力地位，使妇女参政问题名符其实的见诸实现。
    【本报威县十六日电】冀南妇女联合总会，得悉上海三万妇女联名致书蒋介石、毛泽东、马歇尔呼吁和平，特驰电声援，原文如下：“上海各界妇女姊妹们：看到你们三万人联名呼吁和平的消息后，我冀南广大妇女深感兴奋，并对你们这一正义举动无限钦佩。冀南妇女在久经战争摧残之后；和全国人民及妇女姊妹们同样需要和平与安定的生活，因此我们完全同意你们的主张，坚决反对国民党内反动派依靠美国反动派进行内战，坚决反对国民党内反动派独裁专政。我们极愿与你们紧紧地携起手来，为独立民主和平共同奋斗到底。”
