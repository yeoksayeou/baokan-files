　　Shanghai Shipping Industry Representatives Meet with T.V. Soong
    Demand Revocation of Original Agreement on Opening Four Ports to Navigation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] Shanghai dispatch: The Kuomintang authorities' selling out of the shipping industry and national sovereignty has aroused opposition from public opinion nationwide. On the 3rd of this month, representatives from the Shanghai shipping industry met with the Executive Yuan President T.V. Soong, putting forward seven urgent demands: (1) Revoke the original agreement to open the navigation rights of the four ports along the Yangtze River. (2) Cancel the UNRRA contract for chartering British ships. (3) Cancel the order to open various coastal ports. (4) Acquire the assets of British shipping companies in China. (5) Assist the shipping industry in acquisitions. (6) Reorganize the Shanghai port administration. (7) Revise the shipping industry policy. T.V. Soong was compelled to state that "the cancellation of the opening of coastal ports and the UNRRA chartering of British ships could be implemented immediately." However, regarding important demands such as the revocation of the four-port navigation agreement, Soong remained evasive and did not give a concrete response.

　　沪航业界代表见宋子文
    要求撤消四口通航原议
    【新华社延安六日电】沪讯：国民党当局出卖航业丧权辱国，曾引起全国舆论反对。本月三日上海航界业推派代表竭见行政院长宋子文，提出紧急要求七项：（一）撤消开放长江四口内河航行权原议。（二）取消行总租借英轮合同。（三）取消开放沿海各口命令。（四）收购英商在华航业资产。（五）协助航业收购。（六）整理上海港政。（七）改定航业政策。宋子文不得不表示“对取消开放沿海各口岸，及行总租借英轮二项，即可实行”，惟对撤消四口通航等项重要要求，宋氏仍支吾其词，不予具体答复。
