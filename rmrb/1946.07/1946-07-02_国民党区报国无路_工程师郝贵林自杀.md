　　Nationalist Party Area: No Way to Serve the Country
    Engineer Hao Guilin Commits Suicide
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Chongqing News: Hao Guilin, a veteran engineer who studied in France, committed suicide because he was ostracized by the Nationalist Party authorities and unable to use his skills. When he requested to return to China from France, the embassy staff promised that the government would take care of all aspects of his life and work after he returned. Therefore, Mr. Hao only brought 300 US dollars back to China. After arriving in Chongqing, he first slept on the floor of the Sino-French-Swiss-Belgian Alumni Association on Linjiang Road, and then went to see Weng Wenhao, the Minister of Economic Affairs. However, because of his straightforward nature and lack of skills in speculation, he was not hired. Later, he visited Gu Weijun at the Victory Building three times, but was refused a meeting each time. Because he had been abroad for more than thirty years during the Republic of China, he had no social connections after returning to China. Soon his money ran out, and he had to sell his belongings to make ends meet. At this time, Mr. Hao learned from a fellow villager that more than a dozen members of his family had been brutally killed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. Mr. Hao was doubly stimulated by this and had the idea of ​​committing suicide. He sold all his remaining belongings, paid off all his debts, and hanged himself in the Central Park toilet late on the 15th. He left a suicide note, which was extremely sad, including the words: "I have learned a skill, but there is nowhere to display it; I am trapped in Chongqing and cannot move an inch." It is reported that Mr. Hao had worked as a foreman in the Renault factory in Paris and as an engineer in the Bisnius factory in France, specializing in the manufacture of aircraft, tanks and other machinery. He was highly valued by the French engineering community. He returned to China with enthusiasm, but was forced to commit suicide because he could not even find food. Those who heard about it were all filled with pain, anger and regret.

　　国民党区报国无路
    工程师郝贵林自杀
    【新华社延安二十八日电】渝讯：留法老工程师郝贵林因被国民党当局排斥，一身本领无法施展，其在法请求返国时，使馆人员曾允回国之后，一切生活工作均由政府照顾，故郝氏只带美金三百元回国。抵渝后，先在临江路中法瑞比同学会打地铺，即往见经济部长翁文灏，讵因生性耿直，不善投机钻营，未被录用，后又往胜利大厦三访顾维钧，均遭拒见。渠以三十余年寓民国外，返国后毫无社会关系，转瞬钱钞用尽，乃靠当卖衣物渡日，此时郝氏适从同乡处得悉其家人十余口，均在抗战期间被敌惨杀，郝氏受此双重刺激，顿萌短见，乃卖尽所有剩余衣物，还清全部借债，于十五日深夜自缢于中央公园厕所。临死留有遗书一封，语极悲切，中有云：“学会一身本领无可展，身困渝地寸步难行”。据悉郝氏在法先后曾在巴黎雷诺工厂任大领班及比斯纽斯工厂任工程师，特长于制造飞机坦克等机械，素为法工程界所重视，以一腔热忱返国，竟至不得一饭之地，而被迫自缢，闻者莫不痛愤和惋惜。
