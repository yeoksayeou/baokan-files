Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: Regarding the Li and Wen massacres, China Democratic League Political Consultative Conference representatives Liang Shuming, Shen Junru, Zhang Junmai, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, and Zhang Shenfu submitted a letter of protest to the Kuomintang Political Consultative Conference representatives on the 20th, to be forwarded to Chiang Kai-shek. The protest letter briefly describes the Kuomintang's fascist terror tactics in the assassinations of Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Li Furen (note: Mr. Li has fortunately escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an), Wang Ren, and others, and raises the following serious questions and protests to the Kuomintang authorities:

Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Li Furen, and Wang Ren have consistently stood on the position of this League, engaged in the democratic movement, and their advocacy has been to demand democracy and peace. Their actions have not gone beyond appealing through words. Being subjected to such destruction within the scope of not violating the law, does the government ultimately permit the people to have the freedom of legitimate political activity? If legitimate political activity is permitted by the government, then why does the government allow such illegal acts of destruction to continue to occur in the North and South? If such illegal acts of destruction are not permitted, then why has the Xi'an massacre, which this League protested last time, not been thoroughly investigated and severely punished?

The government has repeatedly called on the people and repeatedly publicly recognized the legal status of various political parties, but in recent months, events such as the "Qin Feng" incident, the Xi'an and Kunming massacres, have clearly and consistently inflicted destruction and oppression on this League. Does the government allow the legal existence of various political parties? Such destruction of peaceful and open political associations, is it not only expelling them but also wanting to force them to turn to underground activities and violent revolution? If not, then why is there no effective protection for this League? Can the government be responsible for guaranteeing all peaceful and open political party activities in the future?

In addition, the League has also proposed to the Kuomintang authorities the following six measures for handling the aftermath of the massacre: dispatching impartial personnel selected by the League and the Kuomintang authorities to investigate the truth of the Kunming massacre, participating in the trial of the perpetrators and instigators of the Kunming case, punishing and removing the local public security officials of Kunming, providing compensation to the families of the deceased and educational expenses for their children, protecting the safety and freedom of Pan Youri and other eleven professors who sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate in Kunming due to the massacre, as well as the general democratic人士, and immediately abolishing the Kuomintang secret service. The protest letter also raised serious attention to the Kuomintang authorities, stating that the League had learned that the Kuomintang secret service "blacklist" included several of the League's Political Consultative Conference representatives and other responsible persons.

　　为李、闻惨案
    民盟向蒋提出抗议
    【新华社延安二十七日电】民主同盟政协代表梁漱溟、沈钧儒、张君劢、章伯钧、黄炎培、罗隆基、张申府氏等七人，为李闻惨案曾于二十日以抗议书一件送交国民党政协代表，转达蒋介石。该抗议书略述国民党暗杀李、闻及李敷仁（按李氏幸已脱险抵延）、王仁等之法西斯恐怖手段，向国民党当局提出如下严重质问与抗议：
    李公朴、闻一多、李敷仁、王仁诸君始终站在本同盟立场，从事民主运动，其主张在于要求民主和平，其行动不出乎以言论相号召，在不犯法之范围内横遭摧残至此，则政府究竟是否准许人民有其合法的政治活动之自由？假如不犯法的政治活动是政府所准许，则政府为何又容许此种非法摧残之事在南北各地继续不断演出？如对于此类非法摧残是不容许的，则本同盟上次抗议之西安惨案为何不查明严办？
    政府曾一再号召国人，一再公开承认各党派之合法地位，而数月来如“秦风”事件，如西安昆明各惨案，显然一致的向本同盟施以摧残压迫，则政府是否允许各政党之合法存在？对于和平公开之政治结社，竟如此摧残，是否不惟驱逐且欲迫使其转为地下活动暴力革命？如果不然，则何以不见对于本同盟予以有效之保障？政府今后是否能负责保障一切和平而公开之政党活动？
    此外，该盟并向国民党当局提出派出与国民党当局选出公正人员调查昆明惨案真相，参加昆案正凶及主使者之审判，惩撤昆明地方治安长官，抚恤死者遗属及其子女教育费用，保护因惨案避入昆明美领事馆之潘尤日等十一教授，以及一般民主人士安全和自由，以及立即撤消国民党特务机关等六项惨案善后办法。该抗议书末并以该盟获悉国民党特务“黑名单”中列有该盟政协代表及其他负责者数人，提起国民党当局严重注意。
