　　Ballads from Outside the Pass
    Tang Erhu
　  Yu Yan
     Tang Erhu,
     White-eyed wolf,
     Squatting in the provincial government,
     Only knows how to demand money and grain,
     When the Japanese entered the territory of Rehe,
     He retreated south in a panic.
     Retreating all the way to the Great Wall,
     The common people wept bitterly,
     Looking up to the sky, they cursed loudly,
     Tang Erhu has no human heart.
     The Kuomintang doesn't care about the suffering of the people,
     Officials only want to collect grass and grain,
     Erhu's belly grows big,
     The people starve,
     A year of severe drought parches the yellow earth,
     After autumn, only two handfuls of chaff remain,
     So many people die by the roadside!
        (Note) Tang Erhu was the chairman of the Kuomintang's Rehe Province.
　
            The Long Road
　
     A road long and long
     The leather cart wheels roll and turn
     The snake mule's copper bells jingle,
     Thousands of carts of grain, thousands of carts of cloth,
     Thousands of carts of donated cotton clothes,
     Ask where the carts are going!
     The people outside the pass are starving,
     A swan feather sent from afar bears deep meaning,
     Expressing the good intentions of the people in the liberated areas.
     Thousands of mountains and rivers, the journey is long,
     Brothers at the ends of the earth share the same heart,
     If you ask whose words these are,
     Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's good proposal.

　　口外民谣
    汤二虎
　  浴岩
     汤二虎，
     白眼狼，
     蹲在省政府，
     光会要钱粮，
     日本进了热河境，
     他向南退却跑的慌。
     一退退到了长城里，
     黎民百姓泪汪汪，
     仰对苍天高声骂，
     汤二虎没有人心肠。
     国民党那管百姓苦，
     当官就为征草粮，
     二虎大肚坠，
     百姓饿断肠，
     一年大旱浇黄土，
     秋后只落两把糠，
     多少百姓死路旁！
        （注）汤二虎是国民党热河省主席。
　
            大路长
　
     一条大路长又长
     皮车轮儿滚滚转
     蛇骡铜铃响叮当，
     千车粮食千车布，
     千车募来的棉衣裳，
     问车儿要到那儿去！
     口外百姓有饥荒，
     千里鹅毛礼义重
     表表解放区百姓好心肠。
     万水千山路途远，
     天涯兄弟心一样，
     你若问这是谁的话
     毛主席朱总司令好主张。
