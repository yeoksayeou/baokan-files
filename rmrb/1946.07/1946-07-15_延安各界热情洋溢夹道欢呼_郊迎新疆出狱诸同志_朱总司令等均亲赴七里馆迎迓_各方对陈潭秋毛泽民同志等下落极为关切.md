Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: One hundred and twenty-nine CCP members, including Comrade Ma Mingfang, who were arrested and imprisoned by the Xinjiang authorities four years ago, were released after General Zhang Zhizhong took charge. Comrade Ma and others departed from Xinjiang on June 10th, escorted by Major General Liu Yazhe, Director of the Communications Department of the Northwest Headquarters of the Generalissimo's Headquarters, appointed by General Zhang, to the border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. They arrived safely in Yan'an yesterday (the 11th) at 5 p.m. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Kang Sheng, Lin Boqu, Yang Shangkun, An Ziwen, Zeng San, Kang Keqing, Zhang Qinqiu, Li Bozhao, and other responsible comrades from the Northwest Bureau and the Border Government personally went to Qiliguan to greet them. When the seven special vehicles arrived, the road was crowded with people, and the vehicles moved forward slowly, with the masses cheering and applauding on both sides. The released comrades waved their hats and handkerchiefs, adding to the warmth. Comrade Cao Huan shouted from the car, "Isn't this the Pagoda Mountain!" A mother, rocking her baby in her arms, said, "Baby, see, we're home!" Among those welcoming them, there were frequent voices of greetings from Northwest comrades-in-arms: "Mingfang, it's been four years, how are you!" Comrade Mingfang's face looked somewhat gaunt due to the torment of prison life, but he couldn't suppress his excitement, frequently waving his arms. Comrade Kang Sheng jumped onto a car, warmly embraced a comrade with a long, dark face, and exclaimed excitedly, "You're finally back!" The comrades on the car replied in unison, "We're home!" Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Lin Boqu shook hands with everyone. The special vehicles proceeded in an orderly fashion from Qiliguan, with various organs, factories, schools, and citizens welcoming them along the way. Workers from the Clothing Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately greeted them with drums and music. After the cars arrived at the Central Party School and rested briefly, the Party School hosted a banquet to welcome the comrades. During the banquet, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and others inquired in detail about the comrades' prison life and the situation along the way, and expressed deep gratitude to General Zhang Zhizhong for his escort and care of the released comrades along the way. Comrades Chen Tanqiu and Mao Zemin were not seen among those released this time, and their whereabouts remain unknown, causing deep concern among the people here.

    【新华社延安十二日电】四年前被新疆当局逮捕紧狱之中共人员马明芳同志等一百二十九人，自张治中将军主新后即获释放。马同志等于六月十日自新起程，由张将军派西北行营交通处处长刘亚哲少将护送至陕甘宁边区边境。昨日（十一日）下午五时安抵延安，朱总司令、任弼时、康生、林伯渠、杨尚昆、安子文、曾三、康克清、张琴秋、李伯钊等，及西北局、边府各负责同志，均亲赴七里馆迎迓。当七辆专车抵达时，道路为群众所拥塞，车辆徐徐前进，两旁群众夹道欢呼鼓掌。被释同志挥动手中的帽子和手巾，倍增亲热。曹环同志在车上高喊：“这不是宝塔山吗！”母亲摇动着怀抱里的孩子说：“宝宝，看到了我们自己的家了”！欢迎者中，不时传出西北战友们的慰问声：“明芳，四年了，你好！”明芳同志由于狱中生活的折磨，脸庞显得有些消瘦，但也抑止不住兴奋的情绪，频频挥臂示意。康生同志跳上汽车，热烈拥抱住一位长黑面孔的同志，兴奋的喊出：“你终于回来了”！车上的同志齐声回答：“我们回到家了”！朱总司令、林伯渠与大家一一握手。专车由七里馆鱼贯前进，各机关、工厂、学校及市民群众，沿途欢迎。被服局工人闻讯后，立即以鼓乐相迎。车抵中央党校，略事休憩后，即由党校设宴为诸同志洗尘。席间，朱总司令等详细询问诸同志狱中生活及沿途情形，并对张治中将军对被释同志之沿途护送与关怀，深表谢意。在此次被释同志中，没有见到陈潭秋、毛泽民等同志，他们的下落仍竟不明，引起此间人士深为关切。
