　　Democratic National Construction Army Visiting Delegation Returns to Headquarters
    Enthusiastically Discusses Excellent Impressions of Yan'an
    Plans to Convey Message to Entire Army and Write a Booklet
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Democratic National Construction Army Yan'an visiting delegation, a group of more than ten people led by Deputy Division Commander Nie Zhichao, returned to their garrison on the 27th of last month. Commander-in-Chief Gao specially hosted a banquet to welcome them back. All members of the delegation were radiant and joyful, enthusiastically sharing their impressions of the visit. They said, "This visit was a practical education for us, much better than receiving a training at home." During their journey to Yan'an, the delegation received warm hospitality from military, government, and civilians in various locations. Upon arriving in Yan'an, they were treated as honored guests. During their two-month stay in Yan'an, they completed visits to all factories, schools, government agencies, and military units in the first month. In the second month, Chairman Mao of the CCP Central Committee, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Liu Shaoqi, Kang Sheng, Lin Boqu (Lin Lao), Xu Teli (Xu Lao), Xie Juezai (Xie Lao), Wang Ming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, Chen Boda, and others answered questions and lectured on various specialized issues such as politics, military affairs, and theory. Chairman Mao once said, "Commander-in-Chief Gao led everyone in the Handan Uprising, which is a major event in Chinese history." He also sincerely and humbly sought opinions on the Communist Party, saying, "The Communist Party is not without shortcomings. As long as everyone sees them, please point them out, and we will definitely correct them." The delegation's impression of Chairman Mao was that he was amiable, kind, humble, and sincere, while Commander-in-Chief Zhu was gentle, kind, and generous. They praised the various places they visited. At the beginning of their visit, a seventy-year-old model farmer from Jinpenwan traveled eighty *li* to Yan'an to慰劳 them with a bottle of liquor and two eggs, deeply moving them. When visiting the prison, they saw that the reformed were freely and happily engaged in production and learning, being influenced by educational methods. They said, "Only in Yan'an can there be such education." Their overall impression of the people of Yan'an was that they had three characteristics: first, regardless of gender or age, anyone over fourteen or fifteen years old understood many issues; second, they all established a sense of collectivism and production; third, everyone worked hard, produced actively, and lived happily. They summarized their impressions of the visit by saying, "The facts prove that the Chinese Communist Party is truly working for the benefit of the broad masses of people. This makes us firmly believe that the CCP's leadership of the Chinese people's revolution will definitely succeed." Currently, the delegation is preparing to convey the details of the visit to all officers and soldiers in the army in rotation and is also preparing to write a booklet for wide dissemination.
