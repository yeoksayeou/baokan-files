The landlords Wang Chuanxu and Mu Huayi from Jiaxiang County, Jilu Yu District, after our army liberated Jiaxiang, unwilling to implement the rent reduction and interest rate reduction decrees, fled to Xuzhou with 150,000 yuan, hoping to join the ranks of the Jiang army and obtain an official position. They stayed for a month, but nothing came of it. The cost of living was high, and they wasted a lot of money. Just as they were in a dilemma, the Jiang army discovered that they were carrying a large sum of money and arrested them on the charge of being "Communist spies." The two landlords argued tirelessly, proving that they had fled because of their "anti-communism," but to no avail. They used up the remaining 100,000 yuan to finally secure their release. Destitute and filled with regret, the two landlords returned to the Jiaxiang liberated area a few days ago. Our democratic government and the broad masses expressed infinite sympathy for their tragic experience. The two have voluntarily agreed to implement government decrees and have now settled down and established themselves.

　　嘉祥逃亡地主落得悲惨下场
    冀鲁豫区嘉祥县地主王传绪、穆华义二人，于我军解放嘉祥后，因不愿执行减租减息法令，携款十五万元出走徐州，想投奔蒋军，混得一官半职。住了一月，一筹莫展，米珠薪桂，白耗去许多钱。正在进退两难之际，忽被蒋军侦知该二人携有巨款，即以“共产党暗探”罪名逮捕。两人费尽唇舌，证明自己系因“反共”而出走，亦属徒然；将所余十万元用尽始获无罪，二地主衣食无着追悔无及，已于日前返回嘉祥解放区。我民主政府及广大群众对其悲惨遭遇，咸表无限同情，该二人自愿执行政府法令，现已安家立业。
