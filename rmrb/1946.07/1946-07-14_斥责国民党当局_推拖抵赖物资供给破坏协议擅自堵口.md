　　Reprimanding the Kuomintang Authorities
　  Delaying and Denying Material Supply and Sabotaging the Agreement by Unauthorized Damming
    [Handan, 9th] The "Ji Lu Yu Daily" recently published a commentary, reprimanding the Kuomintang for violating the Nanjing Agreement and unauthorized damming. The commentary first pointed out: "Along the two banks of the old course of the Yellow River, spanning over a thousand miles in the Liberated Areas, the Ji Lu Yu and Bohai regions mobilized a total of 370,000 people, enduring hardships and working intensely for over a month to repair the dikes. However, the Kuomintang has adopted a policy of procrastination, delay, and denial regarding the allocation of funds for the first phase of the dike restoration project, which was originally agreed upon, including 1,000,000 yuan for construction costs, 8,000 tons of flour for construction grain, and 1,500,000 yuan for relocation and relief expenses. Except for the construction grain, of which only one-eighth was delivered under the strict supervision of the government and people in the Liberated Areas, none of the rest has been issued. They push it from Nanjing to Kaifeng, from Kaifeng to the foreigners, and the foreigners push it back to the Chinese, and in the end, it is still pushed back to Nanjing. If they can't push it away, they delay it. They verbally promise to allocate it immediately, or say that a certain amount has been allocated, and more will be allocated, but in fact, not a single penny has been allocated. If they can't delay it any longer, they deny it. They simply refuse to acknowledge the previously agreed-upon 1,000,000 yuan for construction costs. As for the relocation and relief of residents in the riverbed, they conduct "investigations" today and "investigations" tomorrow. One group of people leaves, and another group arrives, and even today they are still "investigating" and "visiting." Even Engineer Zhang Lichun of the Yellow River Commission could not help but say fairly: "In the implementation of the Nanjing Agreement, the Liberated Areas have done 100%, while the Kuomintang government has done zero." This policy of the Kuomintang has seriously hindered the progress of the dike restoration project. Therefore, after consultation between the two sides, the meeting on the damming issue on June 15th was postponed to July 1st. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang again broke its promise and began throwing stones on the 22nd without authorization, actively proceeding with damming and water release." The commentary pointedly stated: "June 22nd was the last day of the first fifteen-day ceasefire, which shows the Kuomintang's conspiracy to coordinate water release with the civil war." The commentary finally firmly declared: "If the reactionaries dare to disregard the condemnation of the world and release water without authorization, then the millions of people in our Liberated Areas will inevitably be forced to take all necessary measures and rise up to defend themselves to the death."

　　斥责国民党当局
　  推拖抵赖物资供给破坏协议擅自堵口
    【邯郸九日电】冀鲁豫日报顷特发表评论，斥责国民党破坏南京协议，擅自堵口，该评论首先指出：“在解放区一千数百里的故道两岸，冀鲁豫、渤海两区共动员三十七万人，不避艰苦，紧张修堤已达月余，而国民党对原经商定之第一期复堤工程工款一百万万元，工粮、面粉八千吨，迁移救济费一百五十万元等之拨发，则采取推、拖、赖的办法，除工粮一项在解放区政民严厉督责下仅运来八分之一外，其余一概不发，找南京推开封，开封推外国人，外国人又推中国人，最后还是推到南京。推不开就拖，口头允许马上就拨，或说已拨若干，又将拨若干，其实分文未拨。拖拖不了就赖，对先前承认的一百万万元工款索性不承认了，对河床居民迁移救济，今天“调查”，明天“调查”，去了一批人，又来了一批人，一直到今天仍在“调查”“访问”，连黄委会张李春工程师也不得不公正的说：“执行南京协议，解放区做到了百分之百，而国民党政府则等于零。”国民党此种政策，严重的阻碍了复堤工程的进行，因此经双方商定将六月十五日关于堵口问题的会议延期至七月一日，不料国民党竟又背约，于二十二日擅自开始抛石，积极进行堵口放水。”该评论尖锐指出：“六月二十二日正是第一次十五天停战的最后一天，这说明了国民党企图以放水配合内战的阴谋。”该评论最后坚决宣称：“如果反动派敢于冒天下之大不韪，擅自放水，则我解放区千百万人民，势必被迫采取一切必要手段，奋起拚死自卫。”
