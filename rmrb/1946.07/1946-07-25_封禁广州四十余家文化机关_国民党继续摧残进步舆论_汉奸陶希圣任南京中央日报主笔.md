Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 18th (Delayed): Guangzhou airmail news: The Kuomintang authorities have recently sealed off over forty speech and publication organizations in Guangzhou. It is reported that this measure was ordered by the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department to the provincial government and special agent organs for "strict implementation." On June 5th, over fifty teams of thugs formed by the Kuomintang Guangzhou party, government, military, police, and special agent organs went to various bookstores, illegally confiscating over thirty kinds of democratic publications, totaling over 100,000 copies. All the books of the Brothers Bookstore Company were looted, worth over 30 million yuan, and one reader was shot and wounded.

In addition, more than ten large and small bookstores, including Zhengda, Nanguang, Guohua, Xinsheng, Huaiyuan, Da Shidai, and Guoguang, as well as more than twenty newsstands along Huiai Road and Hanmin Road, were successively searched and looted. Subsequently, on the 5th and 6th, more than thirty magazines, including Literary Life, Guomin, Democratic Weekly, and Democracy and Culture, were ordered to cease publication.

    【新华社延安十八日电】（迟到）广州航讯：国民党当局近又在广州封禁四十余家言论机关。据悉此项措施，系由国民党中央宣传部令饬省府及特务机关“严密执行”。六月五日即由该党广州党政军警特务等机关合组五十多个暴行队伍分赴各书店，非法没收民主刊物三十余种，共达十万册。兄弟图书公司之图书全部被劫，价值三千余万元，并有一读者被开枪击伤。广州书报杂志供应社图书，被劫一空。此外，正大、南光、国华、新生、怀远、大时代、国光等十余大小书店及惠爱路、汉民路一带二十个以上的报摊，都先后被搜劫。随后于五、六两日勒令文艺生活、国民、民主星期刊、民主与文化等三十余家杂志停刊。至六月二十九日，该市警察复携当局密令，封闭出版社、印刷所、派报社等十三家，计有民盟南方领袖丘哲先生主办的人民报，蔡廷锴将军主持的现代出版社，以及华商报与正报分社门市部。广州杂志图书公司、文生出版社、港粤文协分会，兄弟图书公司等。确悉：广州行营政治部原决定于六月份起，完成三项工作，除没收书报，封闭书报杂志社外，尚有第三项搜查全市可疑分子及“异党”分子，“主要是民盟之文化人”，港、粤文化界及民主人士。民盟南方总支部认为此系发动全面内战之整个计划的一部分，号召海内外民主力量奋起抗争。
