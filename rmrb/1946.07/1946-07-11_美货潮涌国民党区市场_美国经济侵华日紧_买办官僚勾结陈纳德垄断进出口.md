Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 8th: Moscow dispatch: The observer Yarov of the News reports commented today on the future of China's post-war economy, saying: "Reactionary elements in American and British financial and industrial circles, primarily those trading houses that had connections with China before the war, are now attempting not only to restore their position that they lost due to the abolition of unequal treaties, but also, taking advantage of their close ties with reactionary elements among the leaders of the Kuomintang, are concentrating all their efforts on the deepest possible penetration of China's economic life. Eleven foreign banks in Central China have resumed operations, and they are demanding not only to conduct normal banking business, but also to issue foreign currency. They are clearly disregarding the fact that these demands violate Chinese sovereignty and are threatening China with refusing loans and reducing trade with China. After the abolition of import and export restrictions in October 1945 under foreign pressure, cheap American goods flooded into China like a tide, and Chinese trading houses were unable to compete with them. The Wenhui Daily reported on June 6 that more than 30 factories and 44 trading houses had closed down. With the resumption of activities by foreign trading houses in China, the number of foreign expatriates has increased sharply, and attempts to evade the abolition of extraterritoriality have already arisen. The Liberal Western Press claims that some people in Shanghai have suggested the establishment of so-called arbitration courts. After the end of the Pacific War, agents of American capital were quick to penetrate the Chinese economy. The development of national resources, industry, enterprises, agriculture, the monetary system, and the establishment of budgets – these are the main parts of the American penetration into the Chinese economy, but they are not complete projects. Recently, the American Global Production Company has obtained the right to explore and exploit oil in many places, especially in the Gobi Desert. The extensive activities of Americans have met with opposition from agents of capital from other countries, especially the British. The British are shocked by the American monopoly in China and are now urging the Americans to give up ground. The North China Daily News claims that China has ample room for trade between the two countries. It can be seen from this that certain elements of American and British financial capital are pushing China back to a semi-colonial state, which violates the sacred purposes of the United Nations, violates the interests of the Chinese people, and violates the interests of those British and American industrialists who want to make China a country capable of absorbing industrial investment."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 7th: Shanghai dispatch: The economic aggression of American imperialist groups against China is intensifying. Here, a huge and astonishingly monopolistic enterprise, the "Sino-American Industrial Company," is being initiated by more than 30 people, including the American "Flying Tiger General" Chennault and Chinese comprador bureaucrat capitalists. The total capital of the company is 100,000 million legal tender, with the head office in Shanghai and branch offices in Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Guiyang, and other places. It has its own ships and trucks for transportation, traveling to and from the above-mentioned areas, and is in contact with Chennault's air transport team. In fact, the company is controlled by Chennault's air transport team and Chennault's company. This year, the goods needed by the United States for export from our country, such as silk, tea, bristles, hair braids, tung oil, Xiang embroidery, etc., are all entrusted to Chennault's company for procurement. And the American imported goods needed by our country, such as machinery, medicines, chemical raw materials, and all daily necessities, etc., are all purchased by Chennault's company and entrusted to the company for consignment sales. National industrialists feel infinite worry about this "flying goods" company.

　　美货潮涌国民党区市场
    美国经济侵华日紧
    买办官僚勾结陈纳德垄断进出口
    【新华社延安八日电】莫斯科讯：消息报观察家雅罗夫于今日在报端评论中国战后经济前途称：美英金融与工业界中的反动分子，首先是那些战前与中国有联系的商行，目前正试图不仅是恢复他们因不平等条约的废除而丧失的地位，而且利用与国民党领导人士中反动分子的亲密联系，刻正集中全力于可能最深的渗入中国经济生活中。华中已有十一家外国银行恢复营业，他们不仅要求经营通常的银行事务，而且要发行外国货币。他们显然不顾这些要求违犯中国主权，并以拒绝借款和裁减华贸易来威胁中国。一九四五年十月在外国人压力下废除出入口限制后，廉价的美国货物便像潮水一般涌入中国，中国商行是不能与之竞争的。六月六日文汇报报导：有三十余家工厂和四十四家商行已关门大吉。随着在华外人商行的恢复活动中，外国侨民激增，并已引起了逃避废除治外法权的企图。自由西报称：上海已有人建议成立所谓仲裁法庭太平洋战争结束后，美国资本的代办捷足先登的渗入中国经济，国家资源之开发，工业、企业、农业、货币制度、预算之建立——这些就是美国人打入中国经济的主要部分，但还不是完全的项目。最近美国环球生产公司已获得在许多地方，特别是戈壁沙漠一带探察与开采石油的权利。美国人的广泛活动，遇到其他各国资本代办、首先是英国的反对。英对美在中国的独占，为吃惊，现正在敦促美国人让出地盘。字林西报称：中国有容纳两国进行贸易的充分余地。由此可见，美英金融资本的某些人士，刻正把中国推回半殖民地的国家地位，这是违背联合国的神圣目的，违反中国人民利益，并违背那些愿意使中国成为一个能够吸收工业投资的英美工业界的利益。
    【新华社延安七日电】沪讯：美国帝国主义集团的对华经济侵略，日益加紧。此间一庞大惊人之独占事业“中美实业公司”正由美国的“飞虎将军”陈纳德等及中国买办官僚资本家们共三十余人发起创办。该公司资本总额为法币十万万元，总公司设于上海，并在南京、汉口、长沙、芜湖、九江、贵阳等地设分公司，自备轮船、卡车运输，往来于上述各区域，并与陈纳德空运队互相联系。实际上该公司为陈纳德空运队与陈纳德公司所操纵。今年美国所需我国出口物资，如丝、茶、猪鬃、毛辫、桐油、湘绣等，统由陈纳德公司委托采购。而我国所需美国进口物资，如机械、药品、化学原料及一切生活用品等，统由陈纳德公司采办，委托该公司代销。对于这一“飞货”公司，民族工业家感到无限的忧虑。
