　　[Report from our Changzhi correspondent] The Huguan County, through joint conferences between local authorities and the military, and joint conferences between dependents of soldiers and village cadres, using methods of self-criticism, has resolved the contradictions between the masses and the dependents of soldiers in some areas during the mass movement, making the relationship between the military and the people, and between the army and the local area, more harmonious and united. In the mass movement in the county, there were instances in some areas where dependents of soldiers who were classified as landlords were struggled against, and there was insufficient care for poor dependents of soldiers, which caused dissatisfaction among some soldiers, leading to disharmony between the military and the local area. Starting in mid-April, after discussions between representatives of the troops and the county government, joint conferences of army and local cadres were held, and both sides conducted self-criticism on specific issues. Afterward, they first went to the first district, where representatives from both sides, together with the village chiefs of each village, visited dependents of soldiers and the masses separately in the Jidian Village to gather opinions and conduct education. Then, a joint conference of dependents of soldiers and village cadres was held to conduct mutual self-criticism. Chen Dongyou, a soldier, had a younger brother who criticized himself for wrongly serving as a puppet village chief in the past, as well as for seizing land from the masses, embezzling grain, and exploiting the masses through high rents and usury. He felt that he had not implemented rent reduction according to the law, and that the masses were right to struggle against him. He also believed that the masses, considering his brother's meritorious service in the army's war of resistance, ultimately treated him leniently, for which he should be grateful. At the meeting, opinions were raised about the lack of respect for and care for dependents of soldiers by individual village cadres, and the village cadres also made sincere self-criticism. The next day, a mass meeting of the entire village was held to examine the issue of the attitude towards dependents of soldiers in the mass movement. The masses reviewed many specific shortcomings in the past work of giving preferential treatment to dependents of soldiers, and unanimously agreed that dependents of soldiers should be included in the mass movement for emancipation and production in the future. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, dependents of soldiers should be given special preferential treatment, and they should be assisted in production to build their homes. Comrades from the troops stated that in the past, they had only listened to one-sided reflections and thought that the local area did not take care of dependents of soldiers, which was wrong, and called on dependents of soldiers to automatically implement laws and regulations, and the troops should help the mass movement. Government comrades stated that in the future, rent, interest, wages, and other disputes between the masses and dependents of soldiers should be resolved as much as possible through mediation and arbitration to enhance unity. After the Jidian problem was resolved, the stationed troops in Wujitou and other villages were moved and automatically mediated the relationship between dependents of soldiers and the masses. Through harmonious consultations between the two sides, more than 200 cases of rental and debt issues were resolved within half a month. By this point, the estrangement between the masses and the dependents of soldiers, and between the local authorities and the troops, was completely eliminated, and the relationship was greatly improved, and the troops were further consolidated.

　　壶关军民各自检讨
    部队地方隔阂消除群众抗属更趋团结
    【本报长治讯】壶关县以地方与部队联席会议，抗属与村干联席会议，各自进行自我批评的方法，解决了群运中部分地区群众与抗属的矛盾，使军民关系、军队与地方关系，更加融洽、团结。该县在群众运动中，曾有部分地区斗争了地主成份的抗属，对贫苦抗属也有照顾不够的现象，引起部分战士不满，以至部队与地方关系不融洽。从四月中旬开始，先后经过部队代表与县政府商谈，又召开军队与地方干部联席会，双方就具体问题进行自我检讨。以后首先到一区，由双方代表会同各村村长在集店村分头访问抗属与群众，搜集意见，进行教育。接着共同召开抗属与村干联席会，互相检讨。战士陈东有之弟检讨过去自己不该当伪村长，以及强占群众土地、贪污粮食、高租大利剥削群众等错误，觉得自己没依法减租，群众斗是对的，又认为群众念他哥哥在部队抗战有功，最后对他宽大处理，是应当感谢的。会上对个别村干部不尊重抗属，及照顾不够之处提出意见，村干部也作了虚心的自我检讨。次日召开全村群众大会，检讨群运中对抗属态度问题。群众检讨出过去优抗工作上不少具体缺点，一致认为以后群众进行翻身运动与生产运动，都应该吸收抗属参加。分配斗争果实时，对抗属应特别优待，并在生产中帮助抗属建设家务。部队同志表示：过去光听片面反映，就认为地方上不照顾抗属，这是不对的，并号召抗属自动执行法令，部队要帮助群运。政府同志表示：以后对群众与抗属中间的租息、工资与其他纠纷问题，要尽可能采取调解仲裁方式解决，增进团结。集店问题解决后，乌集头等村驻军均受感动，回去都自动调解抗属与群众关系。在双方融洽的协商中，半月即解决租佃债务问题二百余件。至此，群众与抗属、地方与部队间的隔阂完全消除，关系大大改善，部队亦更加巩固了。
