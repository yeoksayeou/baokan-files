　　Always Be Vigilant Against Bully Provocations
　　Military and Civilians Unite to Carry Out Mass Movement
    The Garrison in He City Has Closer Relations with the Masses After Review
    [Report from this newspaper in Heze] In Heze City, traitors and bullies provoked soldiers to oppose the mass movement. After the troops conducted self-criticism, the military and civilians became more united. During his time as the enemy hospital director in Heze City, the traitor and bully Tian Boping relied on the enemy's power to forcibly occupy other people's land, force poor people picking up crops to death, and demand diagnosis and treatment fees from poor people seeking medical treatment without giving them proper treatment, which everyone hated. At the beginning of last month, the masses were brewing a struggle against him, so he asked his wife to win over Xue Zhenshan, a soldier from the × Column Communications Team stationed at his house, and falsely cried and told Xue that her husband was honest and honest, and that the people in the South Gate were all bad people who wanted to bully her husband. Without investigation, Xue Zhenshan believed her words. On the afternoon of the 9th, the masses in the Southern District held a meeting to accuse Tian Boping of his crimes. Xue Zhenshan, unaware of the situation, said that Tian Boping would not do such a thing and advised the masses to stop the struggle. Knowing that he had been deceived, the masses led him away. The Column's Political Department investigated and clarified the truth the next day, immediately convened a cadre meeting to conduct review and reflection, and apologized to the village cadres. Later, Xue was criticized and educated. On the 13th, the Column's armed forces and 3,000 people from the city's industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors held a joint struggle against Tian Boping. Before the meeting, Xue Zhenshan conducted self-criticism to the masses, and talked about his experience of being deceived. The instructor of the communications team used this as a lesson, calling on comrades in the troops to pay attention to being vigilant against the evil bullies' conspiracies, not to be deceived, to stand firm, and to actively help the masses to turn themselves over. Someone in the masses interjected and said: "The Eighth Route Army's southern and northern expeditions are nothing more than for our old folks to turn themselves over. Comrade Xue made a mistake, it's because we didn't explain it enough. In the future, everyone should get closer." Subsequently, the struggle against Tian Boping proceeded enthusiastically.
