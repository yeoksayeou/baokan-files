Regarding the Italian colonies issue, at the meeting on the 3rd, with the consent of the Soviet Union, the request put forward by Bevin that the United Kingdom continue military occupation for one year was passed. Therefore, the two most important issues of the Italian peace treaty have been resolved due to the Soviet delegation's practice of its statement on June 22nd that "at the expense of compromise, we are determined to make the meeting a success."
