　　By the Newspaper's Correspondence Section
　　Our newspaper has been published for two months in the blink of an eye. During this short period, comrades from various regions and departments have continuously contributed articles, giving strong support. We would like to express our gratitude here. It is particularly worth mentioning that many leading comrades personally wrote articles amidst their busy schedules. For example, the articles written by Comrades Guo Jingren, Sun Ziying, Xiao Fang, and Bai Tao have achieved excellent results in introducing mass movement experience, exposing special agent conspiracies, and promoting the relationship between the military and civilians in the liberated areas. After the article "Developing Mass Movements in the New District of Anyang" written by Comrade Sun Ziying was published in our newspaper, it was immediately transmitted to Yan'an by the Xinhua News Agency's Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan branch. The head office quickly broadcast it nationwide in its entirety, and many newspapers in the liberated areas published it in prominent positions. Its educational and guiding role is very significant. We extend our congratulations to the author with comradely friendship.

　　These facts once again prove a truth: that leading comrades at all levels personally writing about the things they have personally done, personally led, and various things within their scope of work that have propaganda and educational significance and giving them to the newspaper is the best way to support the Party newspaper, an important step in implementing the Party Central Committee's policy of "the whole Party running the newspaper," and one of the effective ways to exchange experiences and promote work.

　　However, such excellent manuscripts are still rare. Most of the submissions are still fragmented, hollow, and general. There is still a relative lack of comprehensive and typical manuscripts. Although there are many reasons for this, it is probably very important that the broad masses of leading comrades have not yet universally and frequently picked up their pens.

　　The People's Daily is a regional newspaper. It must vigorously reflect the various situations of military and political struggles in the four strategic areas and the dynamics and experiences of local work. However, it is not easy to reflect so many things in a limited space. Therefore, we especially need two types of manuscripts: First, comprehensive and general reports on the situation, problems, and experiences of promoting a certain work in a certain area. Second, typical manuscripts that select typical events that can represent a certain work or a certain problem and report on them in a concentrated and prominent manner. The combination of the two can enable people to understand all aspects of a certain problem or a certain work in terms of width, depth, left, and right. These two major reporting tasks will be difficult to accomplish without the personal involvement of leading comrades at all levels. Therefore, we hope that leading comrades at all levels – especially those at the special and county levels and in the propaganda and education departments of the troops – will enthusiastically and frequently write various comprehensive and typical manuscripts for this newspaper, and use the newspaper to promote and advance their work. We hope that you will regularly send us a copy of your "work newsletters" and "work research" (whether internal or external) and other documents and publications. It would be best if you could send us a copy of your work summaries; otherwise, please write us an abstract.

　　We hope that comrades in offices at all levels (such as the joint offices of various counties in Taihang and the civil affairs departments of Party committees at all levels in southern Hebei) will use your rich materials and collective research advantages to turn your work departments into a reporting base, and provide the newspaper with your investigated materials and research results, so as to set off a wave of research and discussion of practical work. The Taihang Xinhua Daily once launched a discussion on small cooperatives last year. Many joint offices participated in the discussion with their research results. This important and complex issue was thus brought to a relatively satisfactory conclusion, which played a considerable role in promoting the cooperative movement in the Taihang area.

　　We hope that comrades working in the organs: various reports and materials within your work scope are constantly sent to you. You have the most convenient conditions to organize these materials into news articles based on your research and understanding of the actual movement, and send them to the newspaper for publication. When you find that the materials are insufficient or need to be more detailed, you can also quickly give opinions to the reporters and ask them to supplement them. Your research process is also a writing preparation process. Pick up your pens actively, and we look forward to your works.

　　The reason why we especially appeal to leading comrades, offices, and comrades working in organs is because each of the four strategic areas included in our border area has its own newspaper. In order to have a good division of labor with these newspapers, this newspaper especially needs comprehensive, systematic, and typical manuscripts. These manuscripts mainly rely on the supply of the above-mentioned comrades.

　　At the same time, we warmly welcome literary and art workers, practical workers in the troops and localities throughout the region to continuously write short stories, reports, sketches, stories and other works for this newspaper, so as to vividly reflect the various constructions and mass life in this region. We are planning to revise and publish four editions, and these works will get a broad field.

### 希望各方同志多给本报写稿

专栏：

　　希望各方同志多给本报写稿
    本报采通科
    本报创刊迄今，转眼已两个月了。各地区、各部门的同志们在这个短短期间源源写稿，鼎力支持，谨在此表示谢意。特别值得提出的是，有许多领导同志在百忙中亲自执笔，如郭竟仁、孙子英、萧方、白涛等同志所写稿件，在介绍群运经验、揭发特务阴谋、宣扬解放区军民关系上，都达到了优良的效果。孙子英同志所写安阳新区开展群运一文在本报揭载后，立即由新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社电播延安，总社很快的全文广播全国，解放区报纸以显著地位刊登的很多。它所起的教育指导作用是非常之大的。谨以战友之谊向作者致贺。
    这些事实再一次证明一个真理：各级领导同志亲自动手，把自己亲手作的、亲身领导的、和自己工作范围内各种有宣传教育意义的事情，写给报纸，这是支持党报的最好办法，是贯彻党中央“全党办报”方针的重要步骤，是交流经验、推进工作的有效途径之一。
    但是，像这类精彩的稿件还不多见。大部来稿还陷于零碎、空洞与一般化。还比较缺乏全面性和典型的稿件。其中原因虽多，但广大领导同志还没有普遍而经常的提笔，恐怕是很重要的一个。
    人民日报是全区性的报纸。它要大力反映四个战略区的军事政治斗争的各种情况和地方工作的动态与经验。但是在有限的篇幅中反映这许多东西是不容易的，因此我们特别需要两种稿件：一、全面而概括的报导一定地区推行某种工作时的情况、问题、经验……的综合稿件。二、选择能够代表某一工作，某种问题的典型事件，加以集中突出报导的典型稿件。两者配合起来，即可以使人了解某一问题、某一工作的宽深左右各个方面。这两个重大的报导任务，没有各级领导同志亲自动手，将是很难完成的。因此，我们希望各级领导同志——特别是专、县一级和部队宣教部门的领导同志，热心而经常的为本报撰写各种综合、典型的稿件，运用报纸发扬与推进自己的工作。你们所出的“工作通讯”、“工作研究”（无论对内的或对外的）之类的文件刊物，希能经常寄给我们一份。你们的工作总结能寄给我们一份最好，否则亦请摘要写给我们。
    我们希望各级办公室（例如太行各县的联合办公室、冀南各级党委的民运部）的同志们，运用你们那材料丰富、集体研究的便利条件，把自己的工作部门变成一个报导基点，把你们调查的材料、研究的成果供给报纸，以便掀起一个研究讨论实际工作的热潮。太行新华日报去年曾展开对小型合作社的讨论，许多联合办公室以自己的研究成果来参加讨论，这个重要而复杂的问题，因而得到了相当圆满的结论，对于太行区的合作运动，起了相当大的推动作用。
    我们希望在机关工作的同志们：你们所属工作范围内的各种报告和材料，经常不断的送到你们那里。你们有最方便的条件，根据自己对实际运动的研究和了解，把这些材料整理成新闻文章，送到报纸上发表。当你们发现材料不充分或需要更加详尽时，你们也能很迅速的向报告者提出意见，请他们补充。你们研究工作的过程也就是个写作准备的过程。踊跃的提起笔来吧，我们期待着你们的作品。
    我们所以特别向领导同志、办公室和机关工作的同志们呼吁，是因为在本边区所包括的四个战略区中，都有自己的报纸，本报为了和这些报纸很好的分工，特别需要综合的、系统的、典型的稿件，这种稿件主要是仰赖上述这些同志们的供给。
    同时，我们热忱欢迎全区的文艺工作者、部队中和地方上的实际工作者，源源不断的给本报写些短篇小说、报告、速写、故事等各种作品，以生动活泼的反映本区的各种建设和群众生活，我们正在筹划改出四版，这些作品将得到广阔的园地。
