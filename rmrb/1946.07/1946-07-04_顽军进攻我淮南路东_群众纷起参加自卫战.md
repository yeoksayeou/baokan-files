　　Stubborn Army Attacks Eastern Huainan Road
    Masses Rise Up to Participate in Self-Defense War
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 30th】The masses in eastern Huainan Road deeply resent the reactionary clique's mad invasion, and tens of thousands of people have automatically participated in and supported the self-defense war. When the Kuomintang army invaded Babaiqiao, 20 li northeast of Liuhe, sixteen tenant farmers stepped forward to join the militia. Later, when our army launched a self-defense counterattack and recovered Babaiqiao, the militia quickly restored order. When the battle was underway, the masses spontaneously organized stretcher teams, rushing to rescue the wounded from the front lines and transporting them to the rear, while the women took turns caring for, feeding, and washing blood-stained clothes, treating them like brothers.

　　顽军进攻我淮南路东
    群众纷起参加自卫战
    【新华社淮阴三十日电】淮南路东群众痛恨反动派的疯狂进犯，自动参加与支援自卫战者数达万人。当国民党军侵占六合东北二十里之八百桥时，即有十六个佃农挺身参加民兵。后经我军自卫反击收复八百桥时，民兵又迅速恢复秩序。当战事进行时，群众自动组织担架队，纷纷从前线抢救伤兵运往后方，妇女们则轮流看护、喂饭、洗血衣，亲如兄弟。
