　　General Liu Bocheng Cables the Military Mediation Department
　  Welcoming the Cessation of Military Conflicts in Shanxi
　　If Yan's Troops Do Not Violate Orders by Attacking and Restore to Positions Prior to the Ceasefire Order, Troops Under the Jurisdiction of This Military Region Will Immediately Cease Self-Defensive Actions
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 7th Dispatch] General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, upon receiving the telegram issued by the Beiping Executive Headquarters on July 1st regarding the cessation of military conflicts within Shanxi Province on July 4th, immediately instructed all commanding officers under his command to comply. He also cabled the Beiping Executive Headquarters, stating: "I, on behalf of the military and civilians of this region, express my sincere welcome to this decision by the three committee members. We will spare no effort in any measure that is beneficial to China's peace and democracy." The cable emphasized: "Since the issuance of the ceasefire order, I have restrained my subordinates to abide by the order and have not engaged in any transgression. Unexpectedly, the troops of General Yan Xishan of Shanxi have never ceased their attacks on areas under the jurisdiction of this military region for several months. They have continuously mobilized troops, equipped them with Japanese and puppet troops, and used railways to conduct sweeping operations and build pillboxes for encroachment. The suffering endured by the people is indescribable. To cite recent and major examples, on July 3rd, the 42nd Division, 44th Division, 46th Division, and other three divisions, totaling more than 5,000 troops, attacked the Taigu-Yuci liberated area, and are still forcibly occupying Fancun (where the Taiyuan Group held talks with our garrison representatives in March), Beitian, Yangyi, Gezitou, and other places. Furthermore, Yan's troops, in coordination with the Kuomintang army, suddenly captured Maojindu on July 3rd. The situation in southern Shanxi is very tense, and fighting is underway at Shuitou, north of Anyi. Since May, they have used the 72nd Division, 39th Division, and Kuomintang army's 167th Division and 31st Division to carry out 'encirclement and suppression' and 'sweeping operations' against our Jiwang Mountain, Wanquan, Yi's, Xinjiang, and other areas, and are still forcibly occupying more than 130 villages. In the past, our troops were forced to take self-defensive actions as a last resort in order to survive. However, I would like to solemnly declare that if General Yan Xishan can quickly stop his troops from violating orders and attacking, and restore to the positions as of Hai time on January 13th, the troops under the jurisdiction of this military region will immediately cease self-defensive actions. I deeply hope that the three committee members can take swift and effective measures against General Yan's violations of orders."

　　刘伯承将军电复军调部
　  欢迎停止晋军事冲突
　　阎军若不违令进攻并恢复停战令前位置本军区所属部队必将立即停止自卫行动
    【本报邯郸七日电】晋冀鲁豫军区司令员刘伯承将军，于七月四日接获北平执行部七月一日发布之停止山西省境军事冲突电文后，立即通令所属各指挥官遵照，并电复北平执行部称：“对三委员此一决定，本人特代表本区军民表示衷诚之欢迎。只要有利于中国和平民主之任何措置，我们无不勉力而为。”该电文着重指出：“溯自停战命令颁发以来，本人即约束部下信守命令，不曾有丝毫越轨行为，不意山西阎锡山将军所部数月来对本军区所属地区之进攻，从未停止，连续调集部队，配以日伪军，利用铁路辗转扫荡，筑碉蚕食。人民所受之痛苦，无法形容，举其近而大者，有七月三日以四二师、四四师、四六师等三个师五千余人，进攻我太谷榆次解放区，至今仍强据我范村（三月间，太原小组曾于此与我驻军代表举行会谈）、北田、阳邑、阁子头等地；另阎军配合国民党军突于七月三日攻占我茅津渡，刻晋南情况十分紧张，战事正在安邑以北之水头进行中。五月以来，曾以七二师、三九师及国民党军一六七师、三一师对我稷王山、万泉、猗氏、新绛等地区清剿扫荡，至今仍强据我一百三十余村。过去我军曾于万不得已中，被迫采取自卫行动，以求生存。但本人愿郑重声明：若阎锡山将军能迅速制止其部队违令进攻行动，恢复元月十三日亥时位置，则本军区所属部队必将立即停止自卫行动，深望三委员能予阎军之违令事件以迅速有效之措置。”
