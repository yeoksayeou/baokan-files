　　Large-Scale Production Reduces Burden on the People
    Southern Hebei Troops Cultivate 200,000 Mu of Land
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian News] In order to alleviate the burden on the people, the people's soldiers in our Southern Hebei District, under the principle of focusing on agriculture and industry and supplementing with transportation, have launched a large-scale production campaign. The main achievements are reported as follows (based on incomplete statistics): In terms of agriculture, the entire military region cultivated a total of 216,662.5 mu of land (excluding the Fourth Military Sub-district, Independent Brigade, and Health Department), including 6,982.5 mu of wheat, estimated to yield approximately 500,000 jin. A number of model units and labor models have emerged during production. The military headquarters cultivated a total of 602 mu of land (excluding the village head reclamation by the First Guard Company), with each person cultivating an average of more than five mu and mastering the farming season. Cotton, millet, and sorghum have now been weeded once or twice. Manure collection has become a craze in the Second and Third Military Sub-districts. The Second Battalion of the Basic Regiment of the Second Military Sub-district collected 14,600 jin of manure in one week. Comrade Mu Guangwen, a bugler, collected 160 jin of manure in one day despite being ill. The Twenty-sixth Regiment of the Third Military Sub-district collected a total of 140,000 jin of manure. The Third Company of the Independent Regiment collected 7,800 jin of manure. Lü Jinshan of the Fifth Company collected 150 jin of manure in two days. The entire military region has made great achievements in fertilizer accumulation. The Twenty-sixth Regiment of the Third Military Sub-district accumulated 180,000 jin of fertilizer. The Independent Regiment accumulated 42 large carts of fertilizer. The Jize Brigade accumulated 30 large carts of fertilizer (each cart weighing over 1,000 jin). Song Chengxian and Cui Bao, soldiers of the Guard Company of the military headquarters, have integrated production and learning well. Not only do they complete their individual production tasks, but they also help others with cooking, carrying water, washing basins, and cleaning the courtyard. Whenever they have free time, they study new characters. Comrade Yang Wensheng, the leader of the production team of the headquarters, is 45 years old and has played a leading role in production. Soldier Zhu Junlin, who grows vegetables in the garden, can integrate with the masses and exchange labor at equal value. In their spare time, each commander and fighter in the organs and troops engages in handicraft production, such as rolling cigarettes, grinding flour, and making shoes, each doing what they can. For example, the four people in the Materials Section of the Telephone Bureau of the military headquarters made more than 30,000 pairs of buttons in two months, with each person receiving over 8,000 yuan in dividends. In terms of business and transportation, the units directly under the military headquarters earned more than 3 million yuan, the Second Military Sub-district earned more than 40 million yuan, and other units at all levels have also achieved great results.
