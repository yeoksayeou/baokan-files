Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Nanjing Dispatch: Five representatives of the Democratic League in Nanjing jointly sent a letter to Sun Ke and other government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference on the 25th, proposing a thorough investigation of those responsible for the Xiaguan Tragedy and demanding that the government abolish special agent organs and earnestly protect the various freedoms of the people. The original letter is recorded as follows: To Gentlemen Zhesheng, Xueting, Lifu, Lizi, Tiecheng, and Lisheng: On June 23rd, Shanghai people's representatives for peace petition, Ma Xulun, etc., were brutally beaten by thugs at Xiaguan Railway Station, the circumstances of which were bizarre, causing astonishment far and wide. Although it was later heard that the government had punished the negligent police officers and handed the thugs over to the court, we still feel compelled to speak out, and hereby present the following: (1) It was found that after Mr. Ma and others got off the train, they were immediately besieged, insulted, robbed, and assaulted by so-called refugees. The perpetrators and onlookers numbered two to three thousand people. The military police on the scene, sometimes more and sometimes less, sometimes far and sometimes near, consistently failed to take effective measures to stop it, resulting in a delay from 7:00 PM to around 12:00 AM, lasting for more than five hours. In the capital city, with military police everywhere, the failure to maintain order and protect the people's freedom of life and body cannot but make us doubt whether we have a government or no government. Therefore, it can be asserted that words such as "negligence in prevention" are purely excuses for shirking responsibility. We request that the government investigate and clarify the responsibility of all relevant officials and promptly impose the deserved punishment without any leniency, so as to ensure order and security in the future. This is the first point. (2) The commanders of the thugs were actually those who followed from Shanghai, and many so-called "refugees" from Zhenjiang were also involved. Therefore, this incident was not entirely due to the ineffectiveness of the military police in Xiaguan, but stemmed from a kind of special agent activity. This is obvious to everyone and cannot be denied. Since the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, we have consistently advocated that the government must abolish special agents, but this has not been adopted. We once again request the government to seriously consider and implement this as soon as possible. This is the second point. (3) The people should enjoy the freedoms of assembly, association, speech, publication, and petition. Opposition parties and the people have repeatedly requested this, and the government has repeatedly declared it, but it has mostly failed to comply, resulting in frequent violations of human rights. We now once again request the government to earnestly guarantee the various freedoms of the people. This is the third point. Furthermore, Mr. Ye Duyi, a representative of our League, who went to Xiaguan Railway Station to welcome the representatives, was also brutally beaten and seriously injured. He is currently being treated at the Central Hospital, and the necessary medical expenses, as well as the loss of property (handkerchief, pen, leather shoes, and 50,000 yuan in cash), should be compensated. Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu, June 25th.
