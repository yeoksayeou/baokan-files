　　Implement Intensive Cultivation to Guarantee "Geng San Yu Yi" (Three Years of Farming, One Year of Surplus)
    Various Regions in Taihang Intensively Weeding Seedlings
    Yuanqu County Mobilizes 30,000 People in a Weeding Campaign
    [Our newspaper Changzhi News] Various regions in Taihang are seizing the seedling weeding season to implement the principle of intensive cultivation and improved techniques in order to strive for the successful completion of this year's great production campaign. Cadres in PingShun ChengGuan organized a major weeding inspection, first convening a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and technical committee members to conduct ideological mobilization, making everyone understand that the inspection is to increase production, that "picking seedlings is like applying fertilizer," and "the hoe determines the harvest." They pointed out that the inspection should be carried out with an honest attitude, breaking through personal considerations and avoiding carelessness. In early July, District One launched a mass evaluation campaign, summarizing weeding experiences, and promoting the second phase of the weeding campaign. In Chongyan, it was concluded that there were three reasons why the seedlings were well weeded and growing quickly this year: First, the land was hoeed once last fall, making the soil soft and cohesive; second, warm water soaking of seeds was implemented; and third, the technical committee's inspection and guidance played a role this year. According to statistics from eight districts in the county, out of a total of 5,096 mu of autumn land, the quality of weeding was as follows: first-class land accounted for 24% of the total autumn land; second-class land accounted for 62%; and third-class land accounted for 13%. In District Two, Li Shunda's work team in Xigou selected evaluators for each group, who evaluated the quality of weeding every day and conducted self-criticism within the group. In Sitou Village, a "respect the elderly and honor teachers" campaign was launched during weeding, selecting 11 teachers including Su Yuance to evaluate the quality of weeding between households and groups. At the same time, a "milk the corn" campaign is being launched. Guo Xiufa's group in Wanggeng Village, District Five of Changzhi, has already milked 37 mu, and all the manure from the group's outhouses has been carried away. They are now cutting branches and leaves to continue composting. The whole group's corn has been weeded three times. Cui Huhai's group in Lujiazhuang, District One, not only finished milking the manure from their own outhouses but also bought several carts from the city to continue milking. Jia Fukuai's group in Tongtan, Zuoquan, finished milking 85 mu of corn in three days. This year's cotton planting has exceeded any previous year. After the heavy rains, the drought disaster has been alleviated, but work such as pruning and thinning seedlings needs to be carried out urgently. Production bulletins in various counties have issued calls for this. Ji Xiaohuan, a model female cadre in Renzhuang, Licheng, is leading women in learning the technique of thinning cotton seedlings. Forty-five women learned to thin 230 mu of cotton seedlings. More than 20 cadres from the entire District One of PingShun, under the guidance of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, went to the cotton fields to learn. Nanma Village, Lucheng, practiced thinning under the leadership of cotton planting experts. In addition, cotton seedlings are being left too densely in Taihang, and various places are explaining to the masses that the cotton seedlings should be left sparser. As for Jingxing, Heshun, and Shexian counties, farmers have also entered the campaign of banking up sorghum, weeding cotton, and pulling seedlings. Jin Huanghou (Golden Queen) corn in Heshan Village, Heshun, has been weeded three times. Wu Laibao's group is striving to weed Jin Huanghou corn six times and local corn four times, and millet three times. Sudian Village in the new district of Changzhi has reorganized mutual aid and revised the weeding and work allocation methods, awarding points based on labor strength and calculating work credits to reward intensive cultivation. Good workers are awarded one liang of rice for every extra point hoeed. The entire village has weeded 2,924 mu, striving to weed all three times. The rise of this in-depth and widespread movement to improve technology and cultivate intensively will guarantee the successful completion of the "Geng San Yu Yi" (Three Years of Farming, One Year of Surplus) task.
    [Yangcheng 22nd Dispatch] Yuanqu County is carrying out intensive weeding after the rain. This is the third weeding, and 30,000 people with full or semi-labor power in the county are involved in this campaign, accounting for more than 55% of the total population. On the 23rd of last month, the county summarized the production work in the first half of the year. In terms of labor organization, due to the severe slaughter and loss of labor and livestock on the county's more than 193,000 mu of land during the rule of the enemy, puppets, and diehards, according to the existing labor force, each full male laborer must cultivate 19 mu of land, and each ox must cultivate 50 mu of land. Therefore, at the beginning of the mass movement, it was called upon to organize a large number of semi-laborers to participate in production. For example, Hou Qinglian Village organized 90%, and Liu Zhang Village organized 75%. Not only can plowing and weeding be completed according to the season, but also 70% of the county's 14,200 mu of long-fallow land can be eliminated.

　　贯彻精耕细作保证耕三余一
    太行各地紧张锄苗     
    垣曲全县三万人卷入锄苗运动
    【本报长治讯】太行各地正抓紧锄苗季节贯彻精耕细作，提高技术的方针，以争取今年大生产运动的胜利完成。平顺城关干部组织了锄苗大检查，首先召集互助组长及技术委员会议，做了思想动员，使大家了解检查是为了增加产量，“挑苗如上粪”“锄头定收成”，指出检查要采取老实态度，打破情面不马虎不挑皮。一区于七月初展开了群众性的评选运动，总结锄苗经验，推进第二阶段锄苗运动，在崇岩得出今年苗锄得好、长得快的三个原因：一、去年秋地都锄了一遍、土绵和；二、实行了温汤浸种；三、今年技术委员会检查指导起了作用。据该县八个区统计，共有秋地五千零九十六亩，锄苗好坏情况，计一等地占全秋地百分之二十四；二等地占百分之六十二；三等地占百分之一十三。二区西沟李顺达拨工队每组都选有评判员，每天评议锄苗好坏，在组里检讨。寺头村则于锄苗中展开了敬老尊师运动，选出粟元则十一位老师，评议户与户，组与组相互锄苗好坏。与此同时正掀起奶玉茭运动，长治五区王赓村郭秀法组现已奶了三十七亩，全组茅坑的大粪都已担完，正割荆叶继续沤粪，全组玉茭已锄三遍。一区鹿家庄崔虎孩组奶完了自己毛坑的粪，还在城里买了几车继续奶。左权桐滩贾富魁组三天奶完八十五亩玉茭。今年植棉超过过去任何一年，大雨以后，油旱灾害，已形减轻，但打杈，脱裤定苗等工作急需进行，各县生产小报已为此发出号召，黎城仁庄模范妇女干部吉小焕等领导妇女学习棉苗脱裤技术，四十五个妇女，学脱棉苗二百三十亩。平顺一区全体干部二十余人，在农林局的指导下，就到棉田学习，潞城南马村在植棉能手领导下实习脱裤。此外太行棉苗留得太稠，各地正向群众解释，要把棉苗留得稀一点。至于井陉、和顺、涉县农民亦均进入搂高粱锄花拔苗的运动。和顺合山村金皇后玉茭已锄完三遍，吴来保组争取金皇后玉茭要锄六遍，土玉茭锄四遍谷三遍。长治新区苏店村则整顿了互助改订锄苗拨工办法，按劳力强弱计分按活计工以奖励精耕细作，好把式每多锄一分奖米一两，全村已锄完二千九百二十四亩，争取全部锄三遍。此种深入普遍的提高技术精耕细作的运动之兴起，将保证耕三余一的任务胜利完成。
    【阳城二十二日电】垣曲全县雨后正进行紧张锄苗。此系第三次锄苗，全县有全半劳力三万人卷入这个运动，占全人口百分之五十五强。上月二十三日全县曾总结上半年生产工作，在劳力组织上由于全县十九万三千余亩土地劳力，畜力在敌伪顽统治时，屠杀损失严重，以现有劳力计算，每一全男劳动力须种地十九亩，畜力每犋耕地五十亩。所以在群运开始即号召在运动中大量组织半劳力参加生产，如后清廉村即组织起百分之九十，刘张村组织起百分之七十五，不仅耕种锄苗可以按季节完成，并消灭全县百分之七十的熟荒一万四千二百亩。
