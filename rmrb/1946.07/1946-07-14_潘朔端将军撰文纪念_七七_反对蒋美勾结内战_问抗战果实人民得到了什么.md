Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 11th. General Pan Shuoduan, Commander of the First Army of the Democratic Allied Forces, wrote an article for the Liaodong Daily on the anniversary of "July 7th," entitled "What Did the People Get from the Fruits of the War of Resistance?" The article listed the contributions of the Yunnan troops in the War of Resistance, stating: "The Yunnan troops, equipped with the blood and sweat of the elders of Yunnan, persisted for forty-one days in the Battle of Taierzhuang. In the battle to defend Wuhan, the 184th Division was responsible for the frontal attack of the entire army. After the defense, it participated in the Gan Mountain operation. When Vietnam fell in 1940 and Yunnan became strained, the 184th Division left Gan Mountain. The Yunnan troops stationed on the Yunnan border have contributed a lot to the country and the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, what exactly have the Yunnan soldiers gained?" General Pan wrote about the lives of the people of Yunnan, saying: "The滇缅公路 (Diān Miǎn Gōnglù) [Burma Road] in the high mountains was built with the blood and sweat of women and children, while the bureaucratic capitalists made a fortune from the national crisis. As for purchasing public bonds and contributing money to the country, the people of Yunnan have truly fulfilled the requirements of contributing their strength and money. Today, in addition to being subjected to the Kuomintang authorities' "rural cleansing" everywhere (which the common people call "cleansing the boxes"), checking everywhere, bearing a burden far exceeding the period of the War of Resistance, and experiencing shockingly high prices for necessities, the people of Yunnan have gained nothing else." General Pan concluded, "Now the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee has passed the U.S. military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, and it is clear that China's civil war will continue to expand as a result. With the concession of inland navigation rights and the agreement on stationing troops in the interior, although our China has struggled out of the aggression of Japanese imperialism, it seems that it will become a single colony of the United States. To break this shackle, we must first oppose the civil war and oppose the U.S. imperialist elements fueling the Chinese civil war. More importantly, we must strive for democracy to obtain the fruits of our victory in the War of Resistance."

　　潘朔端将军撰文纪念“七七”
　  反对蒋美勾结内战
　　问抗战果实人民得到了什么
    【新华社安东十一日电】民主同盟军第一军军长潘朔端将军于“七七”纪念日为辽东日报撰文，题为《抗战的果实人民得到了什么？》文中列举云南部队在抗战中的贡献称：“云南父老们用血汗装备起来的云南部队，曾在参加台儿庄大会战中坚持了四十一天。在保卫大武汉战役中，一八四师一个师担任全军正面出击的任务，保卫战后，又参加赣山作战。四○年越南沦陷，云南吃紧，一八四师遂离开赣山。驻守云南边防的云南部队，对国家民族出力不少。现在抗战胜利了，云南军人究竟得到些什么？”潘将军写到云南人民的生活说：“崇山峻岭中的滇缅公路，都是妇女孩子们的血汗筑起的，而官僚资本家们却借此大发国难财。至于征购公债、献金贡献于国家者，云南人民已真正作到有力出力，有钱出钱的要求。在今天除了受到国民党当局的到处“清乡”（老百姓称之为清箱），到处核查，担负之重远超过抗战时期、生活品高涨骇人听闻之外，云南人民没有得到其他东西。潘将军最后结语称：“现在美众议院外委会已通过美国军事援蒋法案了，眼看中国的内战将因之而继续扩大。内河航行权之让予，与内地驻兵权之协议，我们中国虽由日本帝国主义的侵略下挣脱出来，眼看又将成为单独一个美国的殖民地。我们要扭断这一枷锁，就要首先反对内战，反对美帝国主义分子助长中国内战。更要争取民主，来取得我们抗战胜利的果实。
