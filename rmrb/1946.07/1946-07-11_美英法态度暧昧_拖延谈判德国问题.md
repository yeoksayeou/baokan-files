　　US, British, and French Attitudes Ambiguous
　　Delaying Negotiations on the German Question
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th] TASS reports: Due to unresolved issues regarding the procedural rules of the conference, the discussion of the German question has been delayed, despite the Soviet delegation's insistence on accelerating its consideration. The Parisian press is paying close attention to the negotiations on the German question held among the representatives of the US, British, and French governments. The fact that the Soviet delegation was not invited for some reason has aroused confusion among many. The negotiations are being conducted in strict secrecy. According to official statements, the US, British, and French representatives are discussing economic issues related to the western regions of Germany, but Parisians speculate that they are discussing not only German economic issues but also other matters. These negotiations seem to be related to the fact that the governments of those countries, which were once eager to discuss the German question, are now, for some unknown reason, indifferent to the Foreign Ministers' meeting to discuss the German question.

　　美英法态度暧昧
　  拖延谈判德国问题
    【新华社延安八日电】塔斯社报导：由于和会程序规则问题拖延未决，尽管苏联代表团坚持加速考虑德国问题，但德国问题的讨论，还是被拖延下来。巴黎报界对美、英、法三国政府代表间所举行的关于德国问题的谈判，颇表注意。苏联代表团某种理由未被邀请一点，激起许多人的困惑。谈判在严格秘密中进行。据官方宣称：美、英、法代表在讨论有关德国西部地区的经济问题，可是巴黎人推测，他们不仅讨论德国经济问题，还讨论其他问题。这些谈判与下面的事实存在着某种关系，即不久以前还急急于讨论德国问题的那些国家的政府，现在却因某种不知道的理由，而对外长会议讨论德国问题一事冷淡起来了。
