Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the United States is currently on the verge of an inflation crisis. The soaring prices across the U.S. originated from the suspension of price controls on July 1st. Although Congress decided that the Office of Price Administration should continue to exist until July 20th, since the beginning of this month, prices in New York immediately increased, and recently, the prices of meat and all daily necessities across the U.S. have skyrocketed. The high cost of food is unprecedented in the last twenty-six years. The index of thirty-one types of grain prices was $4.54 the previous week, but on Monday of last week, it rose to $4.86, an increase of $0.36 at once. The price index of basic commodities has risen by 15% compared to ten days ago, which has immediately worsened the lives of tens of millions of families in the U.S. who rely on salaries and wages, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The wage increase (generally $0.18) that workers have obtained through half a year of persistent struggle has been wiped out due to soaring prices. Therefore, the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the United Automobile Workers have urged a nationwide demonstration to be held in mid-July. It is expected that if prices continue to soar, workers may strike again. The New York Consumers Association, with 200,000 members, decided on the 10th to hold a "buyer's boycott" movement on the 23rd of this month to protest high prices. At the beginning of the boycott movement, a large demonstration will be held in the urban area, advising consumers to only purchase necessary food items and not to purchase other items unless reasonable prices are set. Philadelphia will also conduct a similar boycott movement. People in St. Louis, Quincy, and Chicago have begun demonstration movements since the 10th, demanding the restoration of price controls. It is expected that this movement will spread throughout the United States.

　　美国通货膨胀危机
    物价飞腾人民生活恶化全美展开罢购示威运动
    【新华社延安十四日电】综合报导：目前美国正濒于通货膨胀的危机。全美物价的飞涨，起缘于本月一日起的物价管制的中止。虽然国会决定物价管制局继续存在至本月二十日，但自本月初起，首先纽约百物立刻增高，而近日全美肉类食物及一切日用物品的价格，莫不飞跃上涨。而粮食价格之昂，更为二十六年来所仅见。前周三十一种粮食价指数为美金四元五角四分，上周星期一即涨至四元八角六分，一下子涨了三角六分。基本商品之价格指数，较十日前上涨了百分之十五，因而使美国数千万以薪金、工资维系的家庭生活，立即恶化，引起了群众的极大不满。工人半年来坚持斗争所得到的工资增加（一般为一角八分），由于物价飞涨，已化为乌有。所以产业工会联合会、汽车工人工会，已敦促在七月中旬举行全国性示威。预料如果物价继续飞涨，工人可能再度罢工。拥有二十万会员的纽约消费者协会，已于十日决定于本月二十三日举行“购买者罢购”运动，抗议物价高涨。罢购运动开始时，将于市区举行大示威，劝告消费者仅购用必要食物，其他物品除非规定合理物价，概不购用。费城亦将进行同样之罢购运动。圣路易、昆西、芝加哥的人民，自十日起已开始进行示威运动，要求恢复物价管制，预料这一运动将普及全美。
