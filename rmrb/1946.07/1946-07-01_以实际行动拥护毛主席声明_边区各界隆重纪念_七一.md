    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Today—the day of the birth of the great Chinese Communist Party, people from all walks of life in the border region, in resolute support of Chairman Mao's statement of the 22nd, will solemnly celebrate "July 1st." The directly affiliated organs of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, according to the Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China's call to "unite around Comrade Mao Zedong, intensify military training, intensify the mobilization of the masses, intensify production, and oppose American aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war" in the "July 1st" "July 7th" commemorative instructions, have been conducting discussions for several days. Party members and cadres have held internal group discussions, and non-Party cadres have also held enthusiastic chats. Changzhi City in Taihang will have local operas performed all night tonight by the famous Xiangyuan Troupe, Liming Troupe, and People's Troupe from Shangdang to commemorate the occasion. Workers at the Taihang Administrative Office Printing Factory have also launched a heated production competition, voluntarily increasing four hours of voluntary work per person per day from the 23rd to the three Sundays of "July 7th" as a gift to the birthday of the Communist Party. Intellectuals in Jining City, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province, are busily writing commemorative slogans and making arches. Propaganda teams from various parts of the city, carrying a large number of newly printed propaganda materials, are rushing to various townships and towns to spread the word. In Linqing City, Southern Hebei Province, people from all walks of life held grand citizen conferences, citizen forums, and student conferences in various schools, and hired experts to report on the history of the Communist Party's arduous struggle and its merits with the people. During the "July 1st" "July 7th" propaganda week, the whole city will focus on publicizing the bloodshed and sacrifice of the Eighth Route Army during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the democratic government's loans for relief, and the leadership in fighting locusts to help the masses turn over, using cartoons and charts to educate the masses to recognize that peace and victory are hard-won, so that people will resolutely rise up to oppose civil war and oppose American interference in China's internal affairs. Defend peace. Other counties in the Taiyue District are also holding enthusiastic commemorative and propaganda activities.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Under the banner of Mao Zedong, and under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after the land reform movement, the liberated area's farmers have gradually been freed from the shackles of feudal rule, organized themselves to work hard in production, and have moved towards prosperity and new life. In Tianjiatun, Guangzong, there were originally 28 middle peasants, 16 poor peasants, 1 very poor peasant, and 4 rich peasants. Now the number of middle peasants has increased to 42, and all the poor and very poor peasants have moved up, while the rich peasants have remained unchanged. Before the war, the village had 26 head of livestock, 4 of which died in the famine. Now the number has increased to 38. 31 households have built new houses, and the cultivated area has increased from more than 900 mu to 1,520 mu, an increase of more than 60%. The same situation exists in Dianhuying Village, Longping. All 32 very poor households have risen to become poor peasants, 19 poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants, and middle peasant Cao Lin has risen to become a rich peasant. The number of livestock has increased from 35 to 45, and the number of donkeys has increased from 2 to 15. In Shengfotang Village, Weixian County, after the elimination of rent, 17 poor peasants have married wives, poor peasant Shi Decai has added new cotton clothes, new bedding, and new lined clothes. Poor peasant Dan Lanyu harvested 16 bags of wheat this year, and he said, "My family of three has enough dumplings to eat every day, thanks to Chairman Mao." According to statistics from the Taiyue District before May of this year, after the land reform movement, most of the land, grain, property, and other things that the traitors, bullies, landlords, local tyrants, and usurers illegally extorted and plundered have been returned. In the Second District alone, the land that was returned and withdrawn amounted to 22,159 mu, 37,105 shi of grain, and 479 head of livestock. According to statistics from eight villages in Changzi, the number of well-to-do middle peasants increased from 34 to 55, the number of middle peasants increased from 464 to 915, the number of poor peasants decreased from 638 to 389, and the number of very poor peasants decreased from 189 to 7. According to the changes in land purchases by various classes in Shisanzhuang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan District, it shows that in the new democratic society, the trend of land distribution is becoming increasingly rational, so that farmers who have always had no place to stand now have a small amount of land. In 1938, poor peasants in the village bought 1.9 mu of land, middle peasants bought 1.6 mu, rich peasants bought 1.6 mu, and landlords bought 27 mu. In 1939, poor peasants bought 4.7 mu of land, middle peasants bought 11 mu, and rich peasants bought 13.5 mu. In 1940, poor peasants bought 3 mu of land, middle peasants bought 15.9 mu, and rich peasants bought 7.8 mu. In 1941, poor peasants bought 10 mu of land, middle peasants bought 26 mu, and rich peasants bought 1 mu. In 1942, poor peasants bought 24.9 mu of land, and middle peasants bought 65.4 mu. In 1943, poor peasants bought 30.6 mu of land, middle peasants bought 85 mu, and rich peasants bought 22.6 mu. The above-mentioned increase in land purchases by farmers shows that they and the farmers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are moving in two different directions: one is prosperity, and the other is bankruptcy.

    【本报讯】在毛泽东的旗帜下，在中国共产党的英明领导下，解放区农民经过了翻身运动他们逐渐从封建统治的枷锁中解放出来，组织起来努力生产，已走向富裕和新生的道路。广宗田家屯原有中农廿八户、贫农十六户、赤贫一户，富农四户，现在中农已增至四十二户贫农与赤贫已全部上升，富农未变。战前该村原有牲口二十六头灾荒中死去四头，现已增至三十八头，三十一户修了新房，耕地面积由九百多亩增至一千五百二十亩，增加了百分之六十以上。隆平，佃户营村也有同样情形，卅二户赤贫均已上升为贫农，十九户贫农上升为中农、中农曹林上升为富农，牲口从三十五头增至四十五头，驴从两头增至十五头，在威县圣佛堂村自灭租后，十七个贫农娶了妻，贫农石德才添了新棉衣新被单新夹衣，贫农耽兰玉今年收了十六布袋麦，他说：“我三口人每天吃饺子都够了，这要感谢毛主席。”据太岳区今年五月以前的统计，农民经过了翻身运动，把汉奸、恶霸、地主豪绅、高利贷者非法讹诈与剥夺去的许多土地粮食，财物已大部清回来了，在二分区算回和抽回退回的土地即达二万二千一百五十九亩，粮食三万七千一百零五石，牲口四百七十九头。据长子八个村统计，富裕中农由三十四户，增至五十五户，中农由四百六十四户增至九百一十五户，贫农则由六百三十八户减至三百八十九户，赤贫由一百八十九户减至七户。根据冀鲁豫区十三庄各阶层买入土地的变化，说明在新民主主义的社会里，土地分配的趋势日益合理化，使向来身无立锥之地的农民，现在有了少数土地了。该村一九三八年贫农买地一亩九分，中农买地一亩六分，富农买地一亩六分，地主买地二十七亩。一九三九年贫农买地四亩七分，中农买地十一亩，富农买十三亩五分，一九四０年，贫农买地三亩，中农买地十五亩九分，富农买地七亩八分。一九四一年贫农买地十亩，中农买地二十六亩，富农买地一亩。一九四二年贫农买地二十四亩九分，中农买六十五亩四分。一九四三年贫农买地三十亩六分，中农买地八十五亩，富农买地二十二亩六分，上述农民买地增加的指数，他们和国民党统治区农民，是走着两个不同的方向：一个是繁荣，一个是破产。
