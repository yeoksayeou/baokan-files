　　Britain and the United States Use the Reparations Issue as a Kind of Political Pressure

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow Dispatch: An *Izvestia* diplomatic observer wrote that Britain and the United States no longer use the reparations issue as a powerful tool to disarm the German economy, but use it as a kind of political pressure, intending to obtain concessions on other issues that have little to do with lasting peace and security. According to the Berlin Conference's resolution on the reparations issue, Colonel Kossov, commander of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany, was scheduled to issue an order on June 27 to transfer assets from southeastern Germany to the Soviet Union. At the same time, German enterprises that become Soviet property will remain in Austria. This will alleviate the severe shortage of goods in Austria and provide jobs for Austrian workers, employees, and engineers. However, the American and British authorities in Austria, as well as the Austrian government supported by them, oppose this legitimate action by the Soviet occupation authorities. They attempt to create the impression that if the Soviet Union executes this order, "the goal of Austrian independence will be unattainable." However, these people who are eager to protect Austrian independence are the very ones who formally recognized the fascist German occupation of Austria on April 2, 1938. The so-called protection of Austrian independence is merely a disguise for a frank attempt to revise the Berlin Conference resolutions. After the Soviet occupation authorities issued the order, the U.S. government immediately notified the Austrian government that it would hand over all German property in the U.S. occupation zone of Austria to the Austrian government for disposal. However, every "charitable" gesture by the U.S. authorities contains some practical gain. As early as June 10, the *New York Times* correspondent in Washington wrote that the United States is increasingly viewing Austria as a strategic center for it in Eastern Europe.

    英美利用赔款问题作为一种政治压力
    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报外交观察家撰文称：英美已不复用赔款问题为解除德国经济武装的有力的工具，而是用做一种政治压力，意图获得在与持久和平及安全没有多少关系的其他问题上的让步。根据柏林会议关于赔款问题的决议驻德苏军占领区司令科索夫，准将于六月二十七日颁布命令，移运东南德国资产往苏，同时成为苏联财产的德国企业仍将留在奥国。这样便能减轻奥国货品缺乏的严重，并给奥国工人雇员及工程师以职业。但奥境美英当局以及他们支持下的奥国政府竟反对苏联占领当局此一合法的行为，他们企图制造这样一种印象，即如苏联执行此命令，则“奥国独立的目标将无法达到”。但是这些急于保护奥国独立的人，正是在一九三八年四月二日正式承认法西斯德国强占奥国的人。所谓关于保护奥国独立，仅仅是坦白地企图修改柏林会议决议的一种掩饰。在苏占领当局颁布命令后，美政府立即通知奥政府将奥境美占领区中一切德国财产交与奥国政府处理，然而美国当局的每一“慈善”姿态，都包含有某种实际利得。远在六月十日，纽约时报驻华盛顿记者便已写道：美国日益将奥国看成为其在东欧的一个战略中心。
