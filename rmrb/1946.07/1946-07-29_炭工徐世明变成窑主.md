　　Coal Miner Xu Shiming Becomes a Kiln Owner
　　Guo Jingpu
　　When coal miner Xu Shiming came to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region from Yulin in 1940 with his father and wife, he only carried a tattered quilt. Now, he has transformed from a coal miner into a kiln owner. In Baijia Ya, Yan'an County, he owns a coal kiln with twenty to thirty workers, producing 200,000 jin of coal each month. The family of three lives in two cave dwellings, with two newly made, brightly colored, painted trunks filled with new clothes, more than fifty zhang of cloth, and savings of six or seven million yuan. On average, they eat white flour once a day and meat once every five days. Everyone enviously says, "Xu Shiming was a poor worker in the old society who lacked food and clothing, but now he has become a wealthy kiln owner!" His sixty-seven-year-old father also happily said, "My family has suffered the worst hardships in the past, but now we've truly gone to heaven!" Originally, Xu Shiming's home was in Guojiawan, Pinggouchuan, Yulin. The family relied entirely on him digging coal in Yulin City for a living. He toiled like an ox or a horse all year round. Under the heavy exploitation, oppression, and extortion of the Kuomintang government and kiln owners, the whole family had to tighten their belts year after year, still lacking food and clothing and unable to make ends meet. In 1940, he heard that the Border Region was a good place where everyone had food to eat and everyone had work to do. In March, he brought his family to the Border Region. At that time, the township government and the trade union helped him find cave dwellings and food, and he settled down to digging coal. That year, he dug coal for seven or eight months, earning over 1,800 yuan. The whole family made new clothes for both summer and winter. His wife was very happy and said, "The Border Region is truly a good place. Even if I die, I won't go back to my old home." Because he was particularly hardworking and frugal, his family's life improved day by day. In these five or six years, he established his household. Because he himself came from a poor coal mining background, he was very concerned about and cared for the coal miners, treating them like his own brothers. Whenever the workers had any difficulties, he would help them solve them as soon as he knew. For example, when Zhang Bucheng was bitten by a dog in April and couldn't dig coal for more than twenty days, leaving his family of four without any means, he lent him 200,000 yuan. When Zhang Wenyu and others, who had just come from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, still had four family members with nothing to eat, he lent them more than 700,000 yuan to send back to their old homes. Now, the workers in both yards have borrowed more than 3 million yuan from him. The workers say, "Kiln owner Xu not only doesn't exploit the workers, but also helps them. He's really good."

　　炭工徐世明变成窑主
    郭景圃
    炭工徐世明，四零年带着他父亲和妻子刚从榆林来到陕甘宁边区时，只背着一条破被子，而现在他已由炭工变为窑主了。在延安县白家牙他拥有一个二三十个工人的炭窑，每月可产炭二十万斤。一家三口住着两孔窑，新做起两个花花绿绿的大油漆箱子，装满了新的衣服，有布五十多丈，存洋六七百万元，平均每天能吃白面一次，五天吃一次肉，人人都羡慕的说：“徐世明在旧社会里是一个少吃没穿的穷工人，现在变成富有的窑主了”。他六十七岁的父亲也愉快的说：“我一家人过去是把罪受透了，现在真算上了天堂”！原来徐世明老家在榆林萍沟川郭家湾，全靠他在榆林城掏炭谋生，终年和牛马一样受苦，在国民党政府和窑主重重剥削压榨勒索之下，全家人一年到头勒着裤带还是少吃没穿，无法渡日。一九四零年才听说边区是个好地方，人人有饭吃人人有工做，三月间他便带着一家人来到边区，当时乡政府和工会帮助他调剂了窑洞和吃粮，他就安心的下窑掏炭，那一年掏七八个月的炭，长下一千八百元，全家人冬夏各缝了一件新衣裳，他的婆姨很高兴的说：“边区真是好地方，死也不回老家去了”。他因为特别刻苦俭省，家里的生活就一天比一天好，在这五六年当中，把家务就建立起来了。因为他自己出身是个穷苦炭工，所以他对炭工们非常关心和爱护，好像亲兄弟一样，工人们有啥困难，他只要知道，马上就帮助解决。如张卜成四月间被狗咬了一口，有二十多天不能掏炭，家里四口人没有办法，他就借给二十万元。新从国民党地区来的张文玉等，家中还有四个人没吃的，他就借给他们七十多万元，捎到老家里去。现在两厂的工人，已借了他三百多万元，工人们说：“徐窑主不但不剥削工人，还帮助工人，实在好哩。”
