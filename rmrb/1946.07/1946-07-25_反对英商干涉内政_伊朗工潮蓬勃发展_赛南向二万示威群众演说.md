　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Tehran dispatch: The Iranian oil field strike, which erupted in opposition to British oil merchants' interference in internal affairs, is developing vigorously. On the 19th, when World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Secretary-General Seydene arrived in Simla, tens of thousands of oil workers in the area held an unprecedented demonstration. On the 17th, the Iranian authorities in Simla imposed martial law, with soldiers and police lining the main streets. On the evening of the 18th, British oil merchants instigated thugs to attack striking workers, and one of the workers' leaders, a leader of the Masses Party, was assassinated. Afterwards, fearing that the situation would escalate, the Iranian authorities claimed to have captured several "suspects."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Tehran dispatch: World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Seydene, speaking to 25,000 demonstrators who welcomed him on the evening of the 20th, stated: "I formally announce that the Iranian Trade Union has joined the World Federation of Trade Unions. Today, I prove that Iranian workers can not only defend Iran's independence, but their strength is sufficient to support the World Federation of Trade Unions." At a reception held by the Iranian Trade Union Federation the following day, when asked "If an anti-democratic government were to rule in Iran, what assistance could the WFTU provide to the Iranian Trade Union?", Seydene replied: "The WFTU will support trade unions oppressed by dictatorial governments anywhere in the world."
