Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: Shanghai News: The Shanghai People's Organizations Federation and the National Peace Movement Conference published a letter to the American people on July 4th, opposing the current U.S. military aid to China. The declaration stated: "America's military aid is fueling the arrogance of the Kuomintang warmongers... it will inevitably involve the United States in an open and protracted civil war in China. As a result, the U.S. government's vow of 'non-interference' in China's internal strife will become a hypocritical empty statement." The declaration said, "The reason given for the presence of U.S. armed forces in China is to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war, but this reason is no longer believed by anyone." The declaration pointed out: "According to our firm policy, we oppose any anti-American incidents, and we also oppose the United States providing military assistance to any party while the civil war continues today. However, we would very much welcome the United States to assist us in our peaceful national construction with materials and services after the end of the Chinese civil war."

　　上海各人民团体
    反对美国军事援蒋
    发表致美国人民书
    【新华社延安二十七日电】沪讯：沪人民团体联合会暨全国和平运动大会，曾于七月四日发表致美国人民书，反对美国今天以军事援华，该宣言称：“美国的军事援助，助长了国民党好战者的骄横……势将使美国卷入中国公开而长期的内战，影响所至，美国政府“不干涉”中国内争的誓言殆将变为一个伪善的空言。”该宣言说：“美国武装部队留驻中国，理由是遣送日本俘虏，这个理由已不复有人相信。”宣言指出：“根据我们固定的政策，我们反对任何反美事件，亦反对在今天内战不已之时美国以军事援助给予任何一方。但我们都非常欢迎美国在中国内战结束之后，以物质和服务来协助我们和平建国的大业。”
