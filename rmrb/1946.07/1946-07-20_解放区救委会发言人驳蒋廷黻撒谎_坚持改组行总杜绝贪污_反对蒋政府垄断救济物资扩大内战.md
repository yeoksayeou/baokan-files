Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. The spokesperson for the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee recently issued a statement on the relief work issue, stating:

	On the 9th of this month, UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China would be halted from that day forward, and expressed dissatisfaction with the distribution of UNRRA supplies in mainland China. This officially exposed the dark side of the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government's unilateral monopoly of relief supplies and embezzlement. On the 12th of this month, CNRRA Director Jiang Tingfu's lengthy explanation distorted the facts, with the aim of continuing to fraudulently obtain relief supplies, turn them into the private wealth of high-ranking KMT officials, and use them as capital to expand and prolong the civil war. The Chinese people, especially the more than 40 million starving compatriots in urgent need of relief, are even more dissatisfied with Jiang's lies! The spokesperson listed facts to prove that Jiang Tingfu's explanation of relief to the liberated areas was extremely unfair and deceptive. The spokesperson said: In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of our liberated areas suffered countless "sweeps" and "mopping-up operations" by the Japanese army; since 1941, the so-called "three-all policy" of kill all, loot all, and burn all has been implemented, creating many "no-man's-lands" where hundreds of miles of land were barren and not a single tile remained, causing the people of the liberated areas to suffer terrible disasters and losses! Many newly liberated areas (i.e., former occupied areas or areas bordering the enemy) suffered particularly heavy losses. According to incomplete statistics from the Jin-Cha-Ji, Ji-Re-Liao, Jin-Sui, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Shandong, Su-Wan, and Central Plains liberated areas, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, 3.2 million people were killed or died from abuse, injury, or illness by the enemy and puppets, 2.76 million people were captured by the enemy, 2.96 million people are now widowed, orphaned, disabled or alone, 6.3 million heads of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses were robbed or slaughtered by the enemy and puppets, 48 million pigs and sheep were lost, 19.5 million houses were burned down, 1.15 billion shi of grain were lost, 229 million items of clothing were lost, and 222 million pieces of agricultural tools and furniture were lost... Due to these enormous losses, the liberated areas now have 26 million people in need of relief. Other undertakings such as agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, transportation, water conservancy, medicine, and health have suffered serious damage and also need to be restored and rebuilt. Although the local governments of the liberated areas have made their best efforts to carry out emergency relief and organize production and resumption of business, with considerable success, they still need external assistance due to the deep scars of war. The spokesperson pointed out that, according to the "Schedule of Relief Areas and Populations" which lists the occupied areas as having a population of 226 million, of which the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei include Chahar Province which is entirely within the liberated area; Shandong, Hebei, and Rehe provinces which are almost entirely within the liberated area; Shanxi Province which is mostly within the liberated area; and Jiangsu, Anhui, Suiyuan, Henan, and Hubei provinces which are partly within the liberated area. The population of the nine northeastern provinces is also mostly within the liberated area. The total population of the above-mentioned liberated areas is 140 million. According to the Seven Great Work Plans of July 1943, there were approximately 42 million refugees nationwide, while the liberated areas had 26 million refugees in urgent need of relief, accounting for three-fifths of the total number of refugees. If relief supplies were distributed fairly according to the proportion of the refugee population, the liberated areas should have received three-fifths of the total. However, the actual situation is exactly the opposite. The total amount of UNRRA supplies shipped to China is estimated to have reached more than 660,000 tons to date, while the liberated areas had only received more than 3,000 tons as of June 10, accounting for approximately 0.59 percent of the supplies arriving in China. Jiang Tingfu's claim that "the headquarters has continuously strived to transport a reasonable amount of supplies into the CCP-controlled areas" is extremely dishonest!

　　解放区救委会发言人驳蒋廷黻撒谎
    坚持改组行总杜绝贪污
    反对蒋政府垄断救济物资扩大内战
    【新华社延安十六日电】中国解放区救济委员会发言人，顷对救济工作问题，发表谈话称：
    本月九日，联合救济总署署长拉瓜第亚宣布，自该日起，联总一切工业与农业设备停止运华，并对联总物资在中国内地分配情形，表示不满。这就正式揭露了蒋介石独裁政府单方面垄断救济物资营私舞弊的黑暗。而本月十二日行总署长蒋廷黻歪曲事实的长篇解释，其目的在于继续骗取救济物资，变为蒋政府高级官僚的私人财富，与充作扩大与延长内战的资本。中国人民，特别是四千多万急待救济的饥饿同胞，对于蒋氏的谎言，当更为不满！发言人列举事实，证明蒋廷黻氏救济解放区的解释，是极不公正而带有欺骗性的。发言人说：在过去八年抗日战争中，我解放区人民遭受日军无数次的“扫荡”与“清剿”；自一九四一年以后，更施行所谓杀光抢光烧光的“三光政策”，制造很多赤地数百里片瓦不存的“无人区”，使解放区人民罹致惨重的灾难与损失！许多新解放区（即过去的沦陷区或接敌区），损失尤为惨重。根据晋察冀、冀热辽、晋绥、晋冀鲁豫、山东、苏皖、中原等七个解放区的不完全统计，抗战八年中，被敌伪杀死或被虐待伤病致死者三百二十万人，被敌俘捕者二百七十六万人，现有鳏寡孤独残废二百九十六万人，被敌伪抢走或屠宰的牛驴骡马六百三十万头，损失猪羊四千八百万只，被烧毁房屋一千九百五十万间，损失粮食一十一万万五千万石，损失被服二万万二千九百万件，损失农具家具二万万二千二百万件……，由于这些浩大损失，遂使解放区现有二千六百万人口需要救济，其他如农、工、商、矿、交通、水利、医药、卫生等事业，遭受严重破坏，亦需要恢复与重建。各解放区地方政府，虽曾以最大努力进行紧急救济，并组织生产复业，著有成效，但因战争创伤深巨，仍需外力援助。发言人指出：根据“善后救济区域及其人口表”所列之沦陷部分人口二万万二千六百万人，其中如热河、察哈尔、绥远、河北、山东、山西、江苏、安徽、河南、湖北等省，全部属解放区者有察哈尔省；差不多全部属解放区者有山东、河北、热河等省；大部属解放区者有山西；一部属解放区者有江苏、安徽、绥远、河南、湖北等省，而东北九省人口，亦大部属解放区。上属解放区人口共为一万万四千万。另根据一九四三年七大工作计划所载，全国难民约有四千二百万人，而解放区急待救济的难民，则占二千六百万人，占难民全数五分之三。若按难民人口比例公平分配救济物资，则解放区应获得全数五分之三。但是，实际情形恰恰完全相反。联总运华物资总数，迄今估计当已到达六十六万吨以上，而各解放区截至六月十日，仅获得三千余吨，约占抵华物资百分之点五九，蒋廷黻氏所谓“本署曾不断努力，以合理数量之物资设法运入中共控制区”，是极不诚实的！
