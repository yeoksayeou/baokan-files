　　People's Army Enthusiastically Serves the Masses
    Every Day Do One Good Deed for the Masses     
    ×× Brigade Diligently Implements, Achieving Great Success
    [Report from this newspaper in Heze] The "Do One Good Deed for the Masses Every Day" initiative put forward by the Political Department of the ×× Brigade has achieved great success through the consistent implementation by all commanders and soldiers. According to incomplete statistics, in the three months from mid-March to mid-June, the entire brigade helped the masses carry more than 15,000 loads of water, pushed more than 400 carts of manure, and often helped the masses with tasks such as cutting firewood, grinding flour, and weeding seedlings. Everyone did their best to help with whatever the masses needed. Among them, the 2nd Battalion of the 57th Regiment did the best. In addition to completing the above tasks, they also frequently held mass meetings and village cadre meetings to solicit everyone's opinions on the battalion. They set up literacy boards and reading bulletin boards in their stationed areas, helped the masses run schools, and cadres personally went to schools to teach. When they left a certain town, the villagers vied to see them off. An old lady held a soldier's backpack, weeping and saying as if she were sending off her son to war, "Write to me as soon as you get there." Some villagers sent many gifts, which were declined by the troops. They all said, "The army helps the people, and the people should support the army. If you don't accept them, you're looking down on us." Recently, in the summary of civil affairs work, the brigade believed that this initiative has not only become a system in practice but has also further clarified the concept of serving the masses in thought.

    ××旅努力执行已获巨大成绩
    【本报荷泽讯】××旅政治部提出的“每天为群众做一件好事”的号召，在全体指战员一致贯彻执行中，已获得巨大成绩。据不完全统计，全旅自三月中旬至六月中旬三个月中，帮群众挑水共一万五千余担，推粪四百余车，并经常帮助群众割柴、推磨、锄苗等，凡是群众需要帮助的事，大家都尽力帮助。其中做的最好的是五十七团二营，他们除完成上述工作外，还经常召开群众大会及村干部会，征求大家对该营的意见。在驻地设立识字牌，阅报栏，帮助群众办学校，干部们并亲自到学校上课教学。当他们离开某镇时，镇上的老乡们争相欢送，一个老太太拉着一个战士的背包，像送自己出征的儿子一样，流着泪说：“到那里马上来信。”有些老百姓送了许多礼物，被队伍谢绝之后，他们都说：“军队帮助老百姓，老百姓也该拥护军队，你们要是不收下，就是看不起我们。”最近该旅在民运工作总结中，认为这一号召不仅在实际上成为一种制度，而且在思想上更加明确了为群众服务的观念。
