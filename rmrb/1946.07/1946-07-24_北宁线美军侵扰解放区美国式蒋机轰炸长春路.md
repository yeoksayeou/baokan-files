　　Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 21st: U.S. troops stationed along the Beining Railway in northeastern Hebei, in areas such as Liushouying, Changli, and Qinhuangdao, have intruded into the liberated areas five times between July 11th and 17th, mobilizing nearly 300 troops. They even penetrated into more than ten villages and towns in the fourth district of Changli County, including Dizhuang, Miaodaozhuang, Chaohe, Niezhuang, and Liudiianzhuang in Changli. On the 14th, more than 150 U.S. troops from Liushouying in Qinhuangdao intruded into the Zhouzhuang area of the fourth district of Changli, while several U.S. planes flew at low altitude. In addition, U.S. planes have continuously reconnoitered areas such as Sanhe, Zunhua, Fengrun, Yutian, Lulong, Leting, and Changli in recent days. On the 11th, more than ten U.S. soldiers under the 52nd bridge of the Beining Railway even drove three tanks to the Dashifo area of Luan County to harass the area, crushing countless green crops. Military and political authorities and people from all walks of life here believe that if the U.S. authorities do not stop such unreasonable provocations by the U.S. military against the liberated areas and infringements on China's sovereignty, the military and civilians in the liberated areas will inevitably launch a serious counterattack, and the responsibility for the conflict should be entirely borne by the U.S. side. Local military and political authorities have requested Executive Member Ye Jianying to protest to the U.S. side.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Northeast News: On May 13th, when students from Northeast University were transferring to a new campus location, they boarded a train from Changchun to Harbin. While passing near Dingjiayuan, they were suddenly bombed and strafed for two hours by two American "P52" aircraft repainted with Kuomintang insignia. All twelve carriages, including the locomotive, were destroyed. Sixty people were injured or killed, including eleven students from Northeast University. Ma Xiwu, Sun Jiwu, Su Qingwu, and Fan Shiduo were seriously injured and died on the spot. The deceased's brains were splattered, flesh was torn, and skin was ripped open. The injured suffered fractures and broken tendons, with blood splattering everywhere. The scene was extremely tragic. The students from Dongda (Northeast University), after requesting help from villagers several miles away to carry stretchers and automatically bandaging the injured classmates, held a solemn public memorial service.

　　北宁线美军侵扰解放区美国式蒋机轰炸长春路
    【新华社遵化二十一日电】冀东北宁路沿线留守营、昌黎、秦皇岛等地美军，于七月十一日至十七日连续向解放区侵扰达五次之多，动用近三百兵力，并曾一度侵入昌黎县四区之底庄、苗道庄、潮河、聂庄及昌黎之刘佃庄等十数村镇。十四日秦皇岛留守营美军百五十余名，侵入昌黎四区之周庄一带时，并有美机×架低空飞行。此外近日美机亦不断向三河、遵化、丰润、玉田、卢龙、乐亭、昌黎等地侦察。十一日北宁路五十二号桥下美军十余名，竟架坦克三辆驶至滦县大石佛一带扰袭，轧毁青苗无数。此间军政当局及各界人士咸认为美军此种无理向解放区挑衅与侵犯中国主权之行为，美当局如不予制止，解放区军民必然进行严重反击，冲突之责任，应完全由美方担负。当地军政当局已请执行部叶剑英委员向美方提出抗议。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】东北讯：五月十三日东北大学同学转移校址，搭乘长春至哈尔滨列车行经丁家园附近时，突遭改涂国民党徽之美“Ｐ５２”式飞机两架轮番轰炸扫射达两小时，十二节车厢连同机车无一幸免，伤亡六十名，其中有东北大学同学十一名，重伤马锡文、孙继武、苏庆武、范士铎四人当场殒命，死者脑浆崩裂，肉绽皮开，伤者骨折筋断，血液四溅，情景至为惨痛。东大同学于数里路外请来老乡运担架，自动包扎受伤同学以后，并举行隆重公祭。
