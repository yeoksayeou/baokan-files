Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, July 24th: In order to implement Sun Yat-sen's "Land to the Tiller" policy, enlightened gentry and cadres at all levels in the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Area are enthusiastically launching a land donation movement. Mr. Zou Lushan, a well-known gentry in northern Jiangsu and current member of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Provisional Assembly, believes that implementing land reform to allow peasants to obtain land is a prerequisite for achieving economic and political democracy. He took the lead in advocating the land donation movement, voluntarily donating 110 mu of land to landless poor people, retaining only 20 mu for essential family living. At an enlarged cadre meeting in Huaibao County, after studying the Chinese land problem and the rural situation in the county, participants deeply felt the urgent need to improve the unreasonable rural economic system where people who till the land do not own an inch of it, while people who do not till the land own a lot of it. At that time, the cadres attending the meeting volunteered to donate land. County Magistrate Wan Ligu donated 20 mu, County Party Committee Propaganda Officer Tong Longyu donated 80 mu, County Warehouse Director Gao Cihang donated 100 mu, and Nanning District Chief Wan Shou Kang donated 2,000 mu. Following this, cadres and gentry in the Fifth Sub-district (Linfu District) also voluntarily donated land. Xu Bangxian of the Chinese Communist Party Huaian County Committee persuaded his family to donate 900 mu of land and immediately drew up a lease agreement, handing it over to the original tenants for permanent management. Chen Zonglie, Organization Minister of the Chinese Communist Party Sheyang County Committee, also distributed all of the more than 400 mu of land in his family to tenants, except for 50 to 60 mu retained for the needs of his two brothers' families. Lu Pizhen, an enlightened landlord in Xiaojian Village, Haihe District of the county, donated 100 mu of fertile land at the village peasant association meeting, saying, "I can't grow crops in my hands, donating it to them can produce more grain." Xu Yida, a landlord with more than 1,100 mu of land in Xintan District, now teaches at Huaijiang Industrial College. He wrote to the cadres in the district, willing to donate all of his land to the peasants, except for what is necessary for the living of his dozen or so family members.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, July 24th: Chen Yinnan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government, has recently handed over his 1,135 mu of land to the peasant association to be distributed to farmers with little or no land for cultivation. In a letter sent when donating the land, he stated: "I have worked in the border region and lived with the vast peasant compatriots for eight years, gaining a profound understanding: that resistance against Japan must rely on the peasants, and that national construction must also rely on the peasants. The vast number of peasants are the basic driving force of our country's revolution... We should enable farmers with little or no land to obtain land, intensify production, improve productivity, and further enhance their enthusiasm for production." The Border Region Government Chairman sent a special letter of commendation for Director Chen's wise action, and the Central China New China Daily also published an editorial praising Director Chen's action, pointing out that only public servants in the liberated areas could produce such a fair and wise model figure as Director Chen. This is the glory of the liberated areas. Director Chen Yinnan is a native of Sinan, Anhui, 56 years old, and has made considerable contributions to the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in Central China, having served successively as a member of the Huaibei Council, Speaker of the Sinan Council, Administrative Commissioner of Huaibei, and Deputy Director of the Administrative Office.

　　实现孙中山耕者有其田主张
    苏皖士绅干部热烈献田 
    陈厅长献田千余亩边府主席特函嘉勉
    【新华社淮阴二十四日电】为实现孙中山耕者有其田主张，苏皖解放区开明士绅及各级干部，正热烈展开献田运动。苏北名绅现任苏皖边区临参会议员邹鲁山先生，认为实行土地改革使农民获得土地，是达到经济与政治民主的先决条件，他首倡献田运动，自动献出一百一十亩土地，分给无地贫民，仅留二十亩作为家庭生活必需。淮宝县在扩大干部会议上，研究中国土地问题及本县之农村情况后，深感种地的人没有一寸地，不种地的人拥有很多土地的不合理的农村经济制度迫切需要改进。当时与会干部纷纷自愿献田。县长万立谷献田二十亩，县委宣传干事佟陇余献田八十亩，县仓库负责人高慈航献田一百亩，南宁区长万寿康献田二千亩。继此之后，五分区（临阜区）干部及士绅亦自动献田，中共淮安县委许邦宪说服家庭献田九百亩，并即立出租约交原佃户永久管营。中共射阳县委组织部长陈宗烈，将家里四百多亩地，除留下兄弟两家人口需用之五六十亩外，也全部分给佃户。该县海河区小尖村开明地主路皮祯，在全村农联会上献出良田一百亩，并说：“在我手里长不出庄稼来，献给他们能多生产些粮食。”新坍区有一千一百多亩田的地主徐以达，现在淮江工业专科学校任教，他致信该区干部，愿将所有田地，除留下家里老小十几口生活必需者外，全部献给农民。
    【新华社淮阴二十四日电】苏皖边区政府民政厅长陈荫南，顷将其土地一千一百三十五亩交给农会，分赠少地无地农民耕重。他在赠送土地时致函称：“我在边区工作与广大农民同胞相处八年，得一深刻认识：言抗日必须靠农民，言建国亦须靠农民，广大农民为我国革命之基本动力…………应使无地或少地之农民获得土地，加紧生产，提高生产力与进一步提高生产情绪。”陈厅长这一明智作法，边府主席特致函嘉勉，华中新华日报亦发表社论，赞誉陈厅长这一行动，并指出只有解放区公务人员，才能出现陈厅长这样公正明智的模范人物，这是解放区的光荣。按陈荫南厅长，安徽泗南人，现年五十六岁，参加华中敌后抗战工作颇有贡献，先后任淮北参议会驻会议员、泗南参议会议长、淮北行政专员、行署副主任等职。
