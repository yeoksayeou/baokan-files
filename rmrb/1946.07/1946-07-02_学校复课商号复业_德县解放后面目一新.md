Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 25th: After the liberation of De County, the democratic government's relief committee has allocated 100,000 catties of grain and 200,000 yuan to aid households in distress and the poor. All nine higher elementary schools and two middle schools in the county are actively repairing their school buildings. Fulun and Xianshi elementary schools have already resumed classes. Businessmen have established a preparatory committee for the chamber of commerce, and more than 800 shops in the city have begun operations. More than 800 railway workers have received relief. The De County telephone bureau is also rapidly recovering. Now the streets in the city are clean and tidy, crowds are thronging, cars come and go continuously, and small stalls are everywhere, sweeping away the desolate scene during the pseudo-army's occupation.

    德县解放后面目一新
    【新华社惠民二十五日电】德县解放后，民主政府救济委员会已拨粮十万斤、款廿万元，救济被难户和贫民。全县九个高小、两个中学，均积极修理校舍，扶轮、贤史两个小学，业已开课。商民成立了商会筹委会，全城八百多户商店开始营业。铁路工人八百余人得到救济。德城电话局也在迅速恢复中。现城内街道整洁，人群拥挤，汽车往来不绝，小摊林立，一扫伪军盘据时之荒凉景象。
