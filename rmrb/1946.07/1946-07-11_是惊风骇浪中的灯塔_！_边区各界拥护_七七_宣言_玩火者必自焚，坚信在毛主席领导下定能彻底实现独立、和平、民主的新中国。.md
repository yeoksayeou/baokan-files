　　"It is a Lighthouse in the Storm!"
    Border Region Circles Support the "July 7th" Declaration
    Those Who Play with Fire Will Burn Themselves, Firmly Believing That Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao, a New China of Independence, Peace, and Democracy Can Be Completely Realized.

    [Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] After the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" Declaration was printed and distributed throughout the border region, it aroused enthusiastic response and sincere support from all walks of life. Celebrities from all circles in the border region wrote articles and sent them to this newspaper to express their opinions. Mr. Xing Zhaotang, Vice Chairman of the参议会 [Consultative Council], sharply pointed out: "The 30 million people in the border region, regardless of all sacrifices, waged a life-and-death battle with the tyrannical Japanese. The only purpose was not to be slaves of imperialists and to strive for peace, democracy, and independence, which are the rights of the Chinese people. No amount of violence can conquer this." He continued with a somber expression: "We oppose aggressors, and we will never turn ourselves into tools of aggressors. We oppose war, and we will never seek war. However, after we paid the highest price to ensure human safety and won a glorious victory, what lies before us is not peace, but civil war, and new aggression by American imperialism. This not only arouses the anger of the people in our liberated areas, but also arouses the anger of the entire Chinese people and democratic people all over the world." In closing, he resolutely stated: "The Chinese and foreign reactionaries' new military adventures against the Chinese people and the liberated areas will eventually lead to their own self-immolation. The only way for us to save the nation is to resolutely support the CCP Central Committee's 'July 7th' Declaration and vow to fight to the end for its implementation." General Zhou Sicheng, former Chief of Staff of the 32nd Army and now a senior参议 [councilor] of the Eighth Route Army, first expressed his warm support for the CCP Central Committee's declaration as a soldier. He said: "Today is the first 'July 7th' anniversary after the victory. The people of the whole country are not joyfully celebrating the victory, but are appealing for peace and stopping the civil war in the face of the danger of civil war. This is so heartbreaking." He called on all patriotic soldiers in the Kuomintang army to resolutely withdraw from the civil war: "Because this is contrary to our glorious goals of the War of Resistance and is against the people of the whole country. As long as we soldiers have the determination and courage to unanimously reject the civil war and stand on the side of the people, independence, peace, and democracy can come immediately." Mr. Shi Minxing, a National Assembly representative from Henan and a veteran Kuomintang member who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen for more than 30 years, praised the CCP's "July 7th" Declaration, saying: "Famous boxers are often tolerant and accommodating; they will not raise their hands to hurt people unless they are pushed too far." He believes that now is the time when the Chinese people have endured and endured again until they can no longer endure. He sarcastically said about the Kuomintang reactionaries colluding with foreign enemies to launch a civil war: "Brothers quarrel and litigate, and what they are arguing about is originally family matters. If one party sells all the family property as litigation costs to win the lawsuit, I am afraid that they will eventually have no home to return to and will cry to heaven with no tears to shed after realizing it is too late!" Finally, he earnestly said: "I hope the reactionaries will think twice. The Qing government and the Northern Warlords sold China's national rights in exchange for foreign military fire and salaries to suppress the revolution, maintain their barbaric autocracy, and carry out massacres of the people. What was the result? Did the people of the whole country let any of them go!" Mr. Gao Zhenwu, a famous educator who has been teaching for more than 40 years, indignantly condemned Chiang Kai-shek's crime of selling out national sovereignty. He used a sentence from The Great Learning as an analogy: "Loving what the good hate, and hating what the good love; this is to outrage one's natural feeling," and is a public enemy of the Chinese people. He emphatically stated: "The CCP Central Committee's 'July 7th' Declaration and Chairman Mao's correct leadership will surely lead us to overcome all difficulties and completely realize a new China of peace, democracy, independence, and happiness."

    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng News] The CCP Central Committee's Declaration on the Ninth Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident has been warmly supported by all circles in the Taiyue region. After receiving the declaration, the District Party Committee immediately rushed to print 30,000 copies and distributed them to various places. Xinhua Daily also published it on the front page on the 7th. Mr. Gao Yanliu of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association said with great joy when he read the declaration: "This is a lighthouse in the storm, a bright light in the darkness. We sincerely support it." He warned the Chinese and American reactionaries: "You should lower your flags, cease your drums, and return your troops to camp as soon as possible, otherwise you will surely burn yourselves." Mr. Wang Fengzhao of the association said: "We fully support the demands in the CCP declaration that conflicts must be stopped immediately, unconditionally, and indefinitely, that the government must be reorganized, internal affairs must be improved, and demobilization and troop reduction must be implemented, as well as the proposal that the US government must stop armed intervention and withdraw all troops in China." The Taiyue Administrative Office, the Taiyue参议会 [Consultative Council], and various mass organizations have also sent telegrams to the CCP Central Committee, expressing their support for the "July 7th" Declaration and their willingness to fight for its complete realization. Guo Shichang, a farmer who had turned over a new leaf in Yangcheng, said: "The CCP declaration has given us a way to stop the civil war. Our farmers must do a good job in rent reduction and production, and use practical actions to support its complete realization."

　　“是惊风骇浪中的灯塔”！
    边区各界拥护“七七”宣言
    玩火者必自焚，坚信在毛主席领导下定能彻底实现独立、和平、民主的新中国。                                                   
    【本报特讯】中共中央“七七”宣言印发各地后，引起边区各界热烈反响与衷心的拥护。边区各界名流纷纷撰文寄给本报，发表自己意见，参议会副议长邢肇堂先生尖锐指出：“边区三千万人民，不顾一切牺牲，与暴日进行殊死战斗，目的只有一个：便是不给帝国主义者当奴隶，争取和平、民主、独立，乃是中国人民自己的权利，任何暴力要想征服，那是决不可能的。”继沉痛表示：“我们反对侵略者，也决不把自己变成侵略者的工具，我们反对战争，也决不寻求战争。然而，当我们为保障人类安全，付出最高贵的代价，赢得光辉胜利之后，摆在我们前面的，不是和平，而是内战，而是美帝国主义新的侵略，这不仅引起我解放区人民的愤怒，而且引起全中国人民与全世界民主人士的愤怒。”在结尾时他坚决的说：“中外反动派对于中国人民和解放区新的军事冒险，终将玩火自焚，我们挽救民族唯一道路就是：坚决拥护中共中央“七七”宣言，誓为其贯彻执行而奋斗到底”。前三十二军参谋长现任八路军高级参议周思诚将军首以一个军人资格对中共中央宣言表示热烈拥护，他说：“今天是胜利后第一个“七七”纪念日，全国人民没有欢欣的庆祝胜利，而是在内战危险面前呼吁和平制止内战，这是何等令人痛心的事”，他号召国民党军内一切爱国军人坚决退出内战：“因为这与我们光荣的抗战目的相违，是与全国人民为敌，只要我们军人有决心，有勇气，一致拒绝内战，站到人民方面来，则独立、和平、民主是能即刻到来的。”河南国大代表追随中山先生三十余年老国民党员时敏行先生赞美中共“七七”宣言，谓：“名拳师多忍多让，非逼之过甚，不肯抬手伤人”，他认为现在已是中国人民一忍再忍忍无可忍的时候了。他讽刺国民党反动派勾引外敌发动内战说：“兄弟阋墙争讼，所争原如家务，若有一方因争讼至将全家财产出卖，作为讼费以求胜诉，吾恐其终将无家可归，哭天无泪后悟无及矣”！最后他恳切的说：“我愿反动派其三思之，满清政府，北洋军阀出卖中国国家权利，换得外国之军火兵饷，压制革命，保持其野蛮专制，肆行屠杀人民，其结果如何，全国人民放过他们那一个啦！”执教四十余年名教育家高镇五老先生愤慨谴责蒋介石出卖民族国家主权的罪行，他引用大学一句话做比说：“好人之所恶，恶人之所好，是谓拂人之性”，是中国人民的公敌。他截钉断铁的表示：中共中央“七七”宣言和毛主席的正确领导，一定能领导我们排除万难，彻底实现和平民主独立幸福的新中国。”
    【本报阳城讯】中共中央“七七”九周年纪念宣言，已获得太岳各界的热烈拥护。区党委于接获宣言后，即连夜赶印三万份向各地散发。新华日报亦于七日以首页地位刊载。河南民主建国学会高延柳先生读到宣言时，非常欣愉的说；“这是惊风骇浪中的灯塔，是黑暗中的明灯，我们竭诚拥护”。他警告中、美反动派：“趁早掩旗息鼓收兵回营，否则必遭玩火自焚”该会王风诏先生说：“我们完全拥护中共宣言中必须立即无条件无限期的停止冲突，改组政府，修明内政，实行复员裁兵等要求，以及美国政府必须停止武装干涉，撒退一切在华军队的主张。”太岳行署，太岳参议会，及各群众团体，亦纷纷致电中共中央，对“七七”宣言，表示拥护，并愿为其彻底实现而奋斗。阳城翻身农民郭世昌说：“中共宣言给了咱们停止内战一条路子，咱们农民一定要把减租和生产搞好，用实际行动去拥护她的完全实现。”
