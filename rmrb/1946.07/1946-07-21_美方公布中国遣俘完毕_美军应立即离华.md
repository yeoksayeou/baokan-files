Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: A Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 15th stated: According to an announcement from the US military headquarters in China, the work of repatriating prisoners of war from mainland China has been completed. This includes 2,220,000 Japanese, 58,277 Koreans, 12,493 Taiwanese, 95 Annamese, and 29 Filipinos, all of whom have been sent back to their countries. It is recalled that the US authorities have repeatedly stated that the sole purpose of US troops stationed in China is to repatriate prisoners. US Secretary of State Byrnes also stated at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in December of last year: "US troops are stationed in North China at the request of the Chinese government. The main responsibility of the US troops is to implement the terms of the Japanese surrender, that is, to disarm the Japanese army and withdraw the Japanese army. Once these tasks are completed, or when the Chinese government is able to carry out these tasks without US military assistance, the US military will withdraw from China." Chinese public opinion has repeatedly demanded that the US authorities fulfill their long overdue promise, but the US authorities have not yet made a clear statement on this. Reliable sources say that not only have the American troops stationed in North China and Shanghai not been withdrawn, but there are also many American troops stationed in Nanjing, and more will be added recently.

　　美方公布中国遣俘完毕
    美军应立即离华
    【新华社延安十八日电】合众社十五日上海电称：据驻华美军司令部公布：自中国本部遣俘返国工作，已告完成。其中包括日人二百二十二万人，韩人五万八千二百七十七人，台湾人一万二千四百九十三人，安南人九十五人，菲人二十九人，均已遣送回国。回忆美国当局历次都说美军驻华之唯一目的，在于遣俘，美国务卿贝纳斯在去年十二月莫斯科外长会议时，亦声称：“美军根据中国政府的请求，驻在华北，美军的主要责任是执行日本投降条件，即是解除日军武装与撤退日军的责任，这些任务一旦完结时，或在中国政府没有美军援助能够执行这些任务时，美军即撤离中国”。中国舆论界已再三要求美国当局实践自己早应实践的诺言，但美国当局迄今对此尚无明白表示。可靠消息称：不但华北与上海所驻美国部队未见撤退，南京现亦驻有美军多人，最近并将增加。
