Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 26th. Mr. Su Dianchen, a county councilor from Xinxian and landlord from Tianjia Yan in the Second District, voluntarily invited his tenants to liquidate past extra exploitation. He said, "In the past, landlords' exploitation and oppression of the masses were fundamentally unreasonable, and this was a bad system of the old society. Now, under the New Democratic regime, those immoral old debts should be liquidated, so that everyone can happily labor and produce." Mr. Su Dianchen's enlightened attitude has won enthusiastic praise from the masses. Therefore, the liquidation meeting was conducted in a harmonious atmosphere. A total of more than 2,200 yuan in silver dollars was calculated for extra exploitation such as "eating accounts" (tenants borrowing four stones of grain in the spring and deducting twenty stones in the autumn) and "harvesting" (tenants working for the landlord without compensation during the summer and autumn harvests), equivalent to 31 mu of land. The masses were willing to let him compensate about one-third less. The tenants said, "Mr. Su Dianchen is voluntarily enlightened and admits his past mistakes. We are happy to calculate a little less."

　　忻县地主宿殿臣自动清算额外剥削
    【新华社兴县二十六日电】忻县有县参议员、二区田家堰地主宿殿臣先生，自动邀请佃户清算过去的额外剥削，他说：“过去地主对群众剥削欺压，根本就不合理，这是旧社会的坏制度；现在新民主主义政权下，那些不道德的老帐，都应该清算掉，让大家都快快活活的劳动生产”。宿殿臣先生此种开明态度，博得群众热烈赞扬，因此清算大会在和谐气氛中进行，共计清算出“吃帐”（佃户在春天借四石粮秋后扣二十石），“收场”（地主在夏秋收场时，佃户无偿的去替地主做工）等额外剥削共合白洋二千二百余元，折出土地三十一亩，群众情愿让其少赔补约三分之一。佃户们说：“宿殿臣先生自动开明，承认过去不对，我们少算些心里也高兴”。
