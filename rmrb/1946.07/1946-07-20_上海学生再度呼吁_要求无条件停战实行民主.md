Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 16th: Shanghai Students' Federation for Peace recently issued a "Further Appeal on the Current Situation," demanding an unconditional ceasefire and the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The declaration points out that the people's representatives who went to Beijing to petition, even after bloodshed, continue to work hard to complete their mission, which should be regarded as an honor. It also states: "The blood of the people's representatives was not shed in vain, because today no one dares to openly declare war; the blood of the people's representatives was not shed in vain, because it has gained the sympathy and anger of millions of peace-loving people all over China and the world, and strengthened the people's power to strive for peace." The declaration firmly states: "The civil war must not be fought again. The people have no food to eat, and we students have no books to read (next semester's tuition is estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan for universities). We will not stop our efforts until peace is achieved." Finally, it reiterates the following demands: (1) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party should implement an unconditional ceasefire; (2) Negotiate sincerely, compromise with each other, and respect each other; (3) Immediately implement democratic politics based on the decisions of the PCC; (4) Stop propaganda inciting civil war and end all atrocities against the people; (5) Demand that Special Envoy Marshall help mediate according to the wishes of the Chinese people.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Chongqing News: The Jiusan Society here recently issued its opinion on the current situation, demanding that the authorities consider the people, immediately lay down their butcher knives, and implement a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire. It also expressed its determination to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes, stating: The purpose of China's anti-Japanese resistance was to seek national independence and equality. Recent government measures, such as allowing foreign troops to be stationed in China, inland navigation rights, territorial sea fishing rights, abandoning tariff autonomy, and insisting that the United States have the final say in Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, all run counter to national independence and are absolutely unacceptable to the people. Members of this society vow to oppose it to the death! In addition, the Chongqing Secondary School Teachers' Friendship Association and the teachers and students of Chongqing University who stayed on campus during the summer have also successively issued declarations, calling for peace, demanding a permanent end to the civil war, and using the manpower and material resources used for the war for production and cultural construction. They also demanded that the authorities improve the treatment of teachers and staff. (Note: The Jiusan Society was organized by famous figures in the cultural, educational, and economic circles such as Chu Fucheng, Xu Deheng, and Wang Zhuoran, and was established on the May Fourth Festival this year).
