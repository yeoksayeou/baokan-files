Yan'an Xinhua News Agency Special Commentary:

　　Today, "July 4th," the Philippines has been declared to be granted "independence." What exactly is this "independence" of the Philippines all about?

　　(1) What Happened Forty-Six Years Ago

　　Originally, the issue of Philippine independence had a long history. As early as before 1898, when the Filipino people were carrying out an independence revolution against the Spanish who ruled them at the time, their revolutionary pioneer Jose Rizal believed that the United States of America, with its democratic tradition, could help the Philippines achieve independence. He traveled around appealing and imploring the United States to aid the Philippines. In 1898, the United States indeed declared war on Spain, and the Filipinos thought that the American army was really helping them achieve independence. However, when the United States and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris in December of the same year, the American imperialists, eager to pursue colonies, completely forgot about the Philippine's demand for independence. The United States used 20 million U.S. dollars to buy the Philippines as its own colony and, in the subsequent eleven months, brutally suppressed the war of independence declared by the Philippines against the United States.

　　In 1899, during the debate on the issue of occupying the Philippines in the 56th U.S. Congress, Republican Congressman Mr. Hepburn said: "The East is the market for selling every pound of surplus flour, corn, and cotton from the United States... It is now not difficult to foresee that Manila will become the commercial capital of the United States in the East. In the future, we should conduct the largest amount of trade with China. China is our natural customer, the Pacific Ocean is our ocean, and the Philippines is our stronghold in the East, which can become the hub of Eastern trade..." In a few words, he revealed the overall U.S. policy towards the Philippines. Moreover, it still represents the U.S. policy forty-six years later today.

　　(2) During the Pacific War

　　After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the U.S. army quickly withdrew from the Philippine Islands, and the Filipino people fell under the iron heel of Japan. The Filipino people were unwilling to be enslaved. They stood up to resist. They organized the People's Anti-Japanese Army to fight for the cause of Philippine independence and liberation for three years. This armed force was organized in March 1942 by some labor leaders, communists, socialists, and peasant leaders, and launched guerrilla warfare in the agricultural areas of central Luzon. It had 30,000 regular troops and 50,000 reserves. During the three-year war, it fought against the enemy and puppets 1,200 times, killing and wounding an estimated 25,000 enemies. In addition, it confiscated the land of landlords who collaborated with Japan and distributed it to the peasants. Elected local councils were established, and local governments were formed. Before the Osmeña government returned to the Philippines, it managed the areas liberated by the People's Anti-Japanese Army. When the U.S. Sixth Army landed in Lingayen Gulf, it was able to easily advance south to Manila because its actions were mainly in the liberated areas of the People's Anti-Japanese Army. When U.S. General Krueger of the Sixth Army talked about the merits of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, he praised: "Among the troops I know, the People's Anti-Japanese Army is one of the best fighting forces."

　　(3) After the U.S. Army Returned to the Philippine Islands

　　In September 1944, when the U.S. army landed on the Philippine Islands, the Filipinos thought their bright period had arrived and warmly welcomed them. The People's Anti-Japanese Army actively cooperated in the battle, reducing many sacrifices for the U.S. army.

　　But how did the U.S. reactionaries repay the Filipino people's flowers, tears, and battles? Last November, the "Amerasia" magazine said: "The first step taken by the U.S. army after entering was to disband the People's Anti-Japanese Army and ask them to hand over their weapons, even though the war against Japan was still going on at that time. The vast majority of elected local officials in the liberated areas of the People's Anti-Japanese Army were arbitrarily dismissed. The commander and deputy commander of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, Lian Lacker and Ariantino, were thrown into prison in April 1945." In July 1945, the American "Nation" magazine published an article, frankly saying: "A certain American commander clearly stated that the motivation for this suppression was due to the fear of the land reform advocated by the People's Anti-Japanese Army."

　　The Filipino people hoped that after the arrival of the U.S. army, those traitors and fascists could be liquidated, but what was the result? The aforementioned "Amerasia" magazine said: "When the U.S. army arrived on the Philippine Islands, Roxas was 'liberated' from Japanese rule. And with MacArthur's personal guarantee, he shed the responsibility he should have borne for collaborating with Japan. Following this, he was appointed as a brigadier general under MacArthur. With this strong support, Roxas became the speaker of the Philippine Senate and became the chairman of the powerful Senate Appointments Committee. Roxas's assistant, Zhu Lieda, was also elected as the speaker of the House of Representatives."

　　(4) A Paradise for Enemy Collaborators

　　MacArthur also helped Roxas actively purge anti-Japanese elements from the government. Roxas's only enemies in the government were the two anti-Japanese leaders, Interior Minister Confessor and Defense Minister Cabili. Roxas used his power as chairman of the Appointments Committee to force Confessor and Cabili to resign. At that time, President Osmeña yielded, apparently as a result of MacArthur's advice. In this way, the Philippine government became a government of pure Filipino traitors and fascists, and among the ninety-five members of the Philippine Congress, turncoats accounted for seventy. Their first job was to make up for the past three years of parliamentary allowances, which caused an uproar throughout the Philippines.

　　"Amerasia" magazine said: "Since the liberation of the Philippines, every event that has occurred there has shown that the power of the United States has been used to strengthen the old ruling group in order to devote itself to suppressing the people's forces." This sentence accurately reveals the actual situation in the Philippines. It is no wonder that Philippine progressive Congressman Billy Mehes sadly said: "The Philippines after liberation is a paradise for enemy collaborators."

　　(5) Roxas's Crimes

　　This April, Filipino traitor Roxas jumped from the speaker of the Senate to the presidency, which is a strange thing unprecedented in history, quite beyond the expectations of the general public. Because Roxas's evidence of treason is conclusive. According to the crimes listed by American newspapers and magazines, the main points are as follows: (1) He surrendered to the Japanese army in the early stages of the war and helped Japan attack the Philippines. (2) He wrote letters to persuade the guerrillas to surrender. Former Osmeña government Defense Minister Cabili received his letter. (3) He served as a member of the pseudo-"Independent Preparatory Conference" and drafted the puppet government's constitution. (4) In 1944, he served as the chairman of the Economic Planning Committee of the Laurel puppet government and later as a minister without portfolio. (5) He plundered food to supply the Japanese invaders and destroyed the guerrillas' blockade of food. The vice president-elect this time, Quirino, is also a top Filipino traitor. He surrendered himself while the Battle of Bataan Peninsula was in full swing. Later, he served as a member of the puppet State Council. Roxas's crimes are very obvious, but he was still elected president.

　　After Roxas was elected president, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt immediately visited his private residence and was full of praise. He then invited him to the United States to meet with U.S. President Truman. MacArthur also washed away Roxas's name as a Filipino traitor, guaranteeing Roxas as a patriot in his personal capacity, and said: "General Roxas, like President Osmeña, will receive the full cooperation of the U.S. government in U.S.-Philippine relations." The United States "strongly supported Roxas to power and forced him on the Filipino people. Its purpose is because McNutt is trying to delay the time and not give the Filipino people true independence. If Roxas succeeds, he will repay the favors given by the United States." Corobin, one of the Filipino democratic leaders, told the audience at a mass rally of returning soldiers in Manila this January.

　　(6) The Shackles of Independence

　　What does the United States want Roxas to repay? This is to accept the so-called Bell Trade Act and the Tydings-McDuffie Act Independence Amendment. The main contents of these bills are that the Philippines should give the United States some trade monopolies in the economy (similar to the British Imperial Preference). Major trade goods from the Philippines to the United States, such as sugar, coconut, hemp, and tobacco, will be taxed if they exceed a certain limit. American businessmen can buy land, own property, and operate all industries and businesses in the Philippines, enjoying the same rights as Filipinos. Filipino businessmen in the United States cannot enjoy the same rights. In military terms, the United States should be allowed to maintain military bases in the Philippines.

　　When Roxas returned to the Philippines from the United States in late May, he signed a $400 million loan agreement with the United States. At the same time, U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt said: "After the Philippine Islands become independent on July 4, they will continue to be an integral part of the U.S. defense security system." This shows that the traitor Roxas, who was supported by the U.S. reactionaries, has met his master's demands on the Philippines.

　　The Filipino people certainly oppose this bill. Manila newspapers call these bills a "joke of independence" for the Philippines.

　　(7) The Outer Jordan in the Pacific

　　To sum up what has been said above, before the U.S. reactionaries granted the so-called "independence" to the Philippines, they had already created a reliable agent for themselves in the Philippines politically, solidified the Philippines' colonial status economically, and turned the Philippines into the "Outer Jordan" of the United States in the Far East militarily. This is the full content of the "independence" given to the Philippines today. This has no similarity whatsoever with the independence that the vast majority of the Filipino people have fought and bled for over the years.

　　When Edgar Snow, the author of "Red Star Over China," arrived in the Philippines last year, a Filipino told him: "The United States conquered us forty-five years ago, and now it is 'liberating' us. From an economic point of view, we are no different now than we were then." Another Filipino said angrily: "The Americans stopped a national revolution in 1900, and now your army has returned to stop another revolution. This time our revolution is to eliminate our fascists." The Filipino people's struggle for independence has not stopped, and their struggle for independence is linked to anti-traitor and anti-fascist elements.

　　Today, the "independence" of the Philippines should become a serious warning to the Chinese people, because those American imperialist elements are preparing to transform China into the Philippines and openly call on the Chinese people to look up to the status of the Philippines. China's oligarchic rulers are responding to the call of the American reactionaries, preparing to turn China into a colony, and a part of Chinese territory under the rule of the Kuomintang government has already begun to move towards the road of the Philippines. The Chinese people are firmly opposed to taking the road of the Philippines! The Chinese people and the Filipino people must resolutely oppose the colonial policy of the American imperialist elements and resolutely oppose those Chinese Quislings who seek glory through betrayal.

### 菲律宾的所谓独立

　　菲律宾的所谓独立
    延安新华社专论
    今天，“七月四日”，菲律宾被宣布给予“独立”了。这次菲律宾的“独立”究竟是怎样一回事呢？
            （一）四十六年前的事
    本来菲律宾的独立问题来历已久，早在一八九八年以前，菲律宾人民在向当时统治他们的西班牙人进行独立革命时，其革命先烈黎萨氏曾以为富于民主传统的美利坚，是可以帮助菲律宾独立的。他曾奔走呼号，吁请美国援菲。一八九八年美国果然对西班牙宣战，菲律宾人以为美军真的帮助他们独立了。但是同年十二月美、西签订巴黎和约时，急于追求殖民地的美国帝国主义者，却把菲律宾的独立要求，忘得干干净净。美用两千万美金，把菲律宾买为自己的殖民地，并在此后十一个月内，残暴地把菲律宾向美国宣布的独立战争镇压下去。
    一八九九年美国第五十六届国会，辩论占领菲律宾问题时，共和党议员薛伯利说：“东方是销售美国每一磅剩余面粉、玉米和棉花的市场……现在已不难预料，马尼拉即可成为美国在东方的商业首府。今后我们应在中国进行最大量的贸易，中国是我们天然的顾客，太平洋是我们的海洋，菲律宾是我们东方的据点，可成为东方贸易的枢纽。……”寥寥数语，把美国对菲政策全盘托出。而且在四十六年后的今日，依然代表着美国的政策。
            （二）太平洋战争中
    太平洋战争爆发后，美军很快的就从菲岛撤退了，菲律宾人民遂沦入日本的铁蹄下。菲律宾人民不甘奴役，他们挺身起来反抗，他们组织了人民抗日军，为菲律宾独立解放事业战斗了三年。这支武装是一九四二年三月由一些工人领袖，共产党人，社会主义者，及农民领袖组织起来的，在中部吕宋的农业区，发动游击战争。它拥有三万正规军和五万名后备队，在三年战争期间，它与敌伪作战一千二百次，毙伤敌人估计有二万五千名之多。此外它没收了与日本合作的地主的土地，把它分配给农民。民选的地方议会建设起来了，地方政权也形成了。在奥斯敏纳政府回到菲律宾以前，它管理着人民抗日军所解放的地区。美国部队在仁牙因湾登陆以后，所以能容易地南向马尼拉推进，也是由于它的行动主要是在人民抗日军的解放区内。美第六军克鲁克将军论及人民抗日军的功绩时称赞道：“我所知的队伍中间，人民抗日军是一个最好的战斗部队。”
            （三）美军重临菲岛后
    一九四四年九月美军在菲岛登陆，菲律宾人以为他们的光明时期已到来，热烈欢迎他们，人民抗日军积极配合作战，使美军减少许多牺牲。
    但是美国反动派怎样报答菲律宾人民的鲜花、热泪和战斗呢？去年十一月美亚杂志说道：“美军进来后所采取的第一个步骤，便是遣散人民抗日军，要他们缴出武装，那怕当时对日战争尚在进行中。人民抗日军解放区的绝大多数民选地方官员，被横加撤职。人民抗日军的正副指挥官连拉克与阿里安蒂诺，于一九四五年四月被投入监牢里。”一九四五年七月美国《民族杂志》发表一文，坦率地说：“某美国指挥官明白表示这种镇压的动机，是由于恐惧人民抗日军所主张的土地改革。”
    菲人民期望美军来后，那些卖国贼及法西斯分子能得到清算，但是结果怎样呢？上述美亚杂志说：“当美军抵达菲岛后，罗哈斯从日本统治下被‘解放’出来了。并且在麦克阿瑟个人担保下，他卸却了与日本合作所应负的责任，随着他被委任为麦克阿瑟部下的旅长。在这种有力的支持下，罗哈斯就任菲律滨参院议长，并成为掌握大权的参院任命委员会的主席。罗哈斯的助手朱烈达也被选为众院议长”。
            （四）附敌分子的天堂
    麦克阿瑟还帮助罗哈斯积极清洗政府中的抗日分子。罗哈斯在政府中仅有的敌人，便是两个抗日领袖，内政部长康费斯，与国防部长加比里。罗哈斯以其任命委员会主席的权力，迫使康、加二人去职。当时奥斯敏纳总统屈服了，显然这是由于麦克阿瑟劝告的结果。这样一来，菲政府便成了清一色的菲奸和法西斯分子的政府，而菲国会的九十五个议员中，落水分子便占了七十个。他们第一件工作便是补领过去三年议员的津贴，一时全菲哗然。
    美亚杂志说：“自菲律宾解放以来，在那里所发生的每一件事，都显示美国的权势是被用来加强旧的统治集团，以便致力于镇压人民的力量。”这句话确切地道出了菲律宾的实际情况，无怪乎菲进步议员比利美夏斯沉痛地说：“解放后的菲律宾是附敌分子的天堂。”
            （五）罗哈斯的罪行
    今年四月菲奸罗哈斯由参院议长一跃而为总统，这是旷古未闻的怪事，颇出一般人意料之外。因为罗哈斯这人投敌证据确凿，根据美国报章杂志列举的罪状，主要便有下列数点：（一）战争初期即投降日军，并帮助日本进攻菲律宾。（二）写信劝游击队投降，前奥斯敏纳政府国防部长加比里就接到过他的信。（三）任伪“独立预备会议委员”，起草傀儡政府宪法。（四）一九四四年任罗列尔傀儡政府的经济计划委员会主席，不久又任不管部长。（五）搜刮粮食供给日寇，并破坏游击队对粮食的封锁。这次当选为副总统的季里诺，也是个头等菲奸分子，在巴坦半岛血战方酣时，他曾自投降书。以后又出任伪国务委员。罗哈斯的罪迹至为明显，但还是当选总统了。
    罗哈斯当选总统后，美驻菲高级专员麦克纳特立赴其私邸拜访，嘉贺备至，旋邀他赴美，参见美总统杜鲁门。麦克阿瑟复替他洗刷菲奸罪名，以个人名义，担保罗哈斯为爱国者，并说：“罗哈斯将军一如奥斯敏纳总统，将获美政府在美菲关系上的全力合作。”美国“强力把罗哈斯扶植上台，硬压在菲律宾人民头上，其目的是由于麦克纳特图拖延时间，不给菲律宾人民真正的独立，如罗哈斯成功，他是会报答美国所赠恩惠的。”菲民主领袖之一哥洛宾在今年一月马尼拉的复员群众会上，这样告诉听众。
            （六）独立的枷锁
    美国所要罗哈斯报答的是什么呢？这就是接受所谓卑尔法案，和泰丁菲岛独立修正法案。这些法案的主要内容，为在经济上菲律宾应给美国以若干贸易上的独占权，（类似英国的帝国优先权）自菲输美的主要贸易货物糖、椰、麻、烟类等，超过一定限额则须抽税。美国商人可以在菲购地置产，经营一切工商业，享受与菲人同等的权利。菲律宾商人在美国，则不能享有同等的权利。在军事上，应允许美国在菲保有军事基地。
    五月下旬罗哈斯自美返菲时，与美国签定了四万万美元的贷款协定，同时美驻菲专员麦克纳特称：“菲岛在七月四日独立以后，将继续为美国国防安全体系中的一个完整的部分。”这说明被美国反动派扶植的奸细罗哈斯，已满足了其主子对菲律宾的要求。
    菲律宾人民当然反对这种法案，马尼刺各报纸把这些法案称为菲律宾“独立的笑话”。
            （七）太平洋上的外约旦
    综合上面所说，美国反动派在对菲律宾付予所谓“独立”以前，已在政治上为自己造成了在菲律宾可靠的代理人，在经济上使菲律宾固封于殖民地的地位，在军事上使菲律宾变成美国在远东的“外约旦”。这就是今天菲律宾被给予“独立”的全部内容。这和广大菲律宾人民多年奋斗流血所要求的独立，决无相似之点。
    当去年《西行漫记》的作者史诺到达菲律宾时，一个菲人对他说：“美国在四十五年前征服我们，现在它正在‘解放’我们。从经济观点来说，我们现在和当时的情况并无两样。”还有一位菲人气愤地说：“美国人在一九○○年阻止了一次民族革命，现在你们的军队回来又恰巧阻止了另一次革命。我们这一次革命为的是清除我们那些法西斯分子。”菲律宾人民的独立斗争并未停止，他们的独立斗争是和反奸反法西斯分子联系在一起的。
    今天菲律宾的“独立”，应该成为中国人民的严重警惕，因为那些美国的帝国主义分子，正准备把中国改造为菲律宾，并且公开叫中国人向菲律宾的地位看齐，中国的寡头统治者，正在响应美国反动派的号召，准备把中国变为殖民地，而且在国民党政府统治下的一部分中国领土，已经开始在走向菲律宾的道路。中国人民是坚决反对走菲律宾的道路的！中国人民和菲律宾人民要坚决反对美国帝国主义分子的殖民地政策，坚决反对那些卖国求荣的中华吉斯林分子。
