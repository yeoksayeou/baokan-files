　　New York Air Mail from Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: The US "New Republic" weekly published an editorial on May 20th titled "One Year After," discussing the US government's foreign policy in the year since the defeat of Hitler's Germany. The article stated: "In this year, our diplomacy is not working, and both idealists and experimentalists feel disappointed. Symbolically speaking, our foreign policy relies on three generals—Franco, Chiang Kai-shek, and Groves (L. Groves, one of the well-known reactionaries of the US State Department's Atomic Energy Commission). The descent from a one-world policy to a three-generals policy is a gradual decline. The main responsibility for this change lies with President Truman and his officials' confusion regarding foreign policy and its implementation—confusion which has become a characteristic of Truman's attitude."
    Paris dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: After the Foreign Ministers' Conference closed, the representatives of the four foreign ministers held their first meeting on the 13th to continue drafting the details of the peace treaty drafts for the five countries. They will continue discussions this week in the hope of completing the draft treaties and submitting them to the 21-nation peace conference to be held on July 29th. Washington dispatch: Byrnes arrived in Washington from Paris on the 14th. When Byrnes disembarked, he said that we have achieved some progress on the road to peace. Truman went to the airport to welcome Byrnes.

    抨击美政府外交政策
    从一个世界的政策下降为三个将军的政策
    【新华社延安十四日电】纽约航讯：美国“新共和”周刊五月二十日社论，题为《一年之后》，内容论述在希特勒德国覆灭后的一年期间，美国政府的外交政策。该文称：在这一年中，“我们的外交行不通，不论理想主义者、实验主义者都感觉失望。象征地说，我们的外交政策依赖着三个将军——佛朗哥、蒋介石与格洛夫斯（L·Grcves，系美国国务院原子能委员会著名的反动派之一），从一个世界的政策，下降为三个将军的政策，是逐渐下降的。这种改变，其主要责任是在于杜鲁门总统与其官员对于外交政策及其执行态度的混乱——混乱成为杜鲁门等态度的特点。
    【新华社延安十五日电】巴黎讯：外长会议闭幕后，四外长代表于十三日召开首次会议，继续草拟对五国和约草案的细节。他们于本周内仍继续商谈，以期完成草约，提交七月二十九日召开的二十一国和会。又华府讯：贝纳斯已于十四日自巴黎飞抵华府，贝氏于下机时说，在走向和平的道路上，我们已达到了若干进展。杜鲁门亲赴机场欢迎贝氏。
