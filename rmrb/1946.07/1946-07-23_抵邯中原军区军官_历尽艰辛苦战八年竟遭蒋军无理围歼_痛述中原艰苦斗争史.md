Arriving Central Plains Military Region Officer in Handan
Having Experienced Eight Years of Arduous Struggle, They Were Unjustifiably Besieged and Annihilated by Chiang's Troops
Bitterly Recounting the History of the Arduous Struggle in the Central Plains
[This newspaper's dispatch] The Chiang army's occupation of our Central Plains Liberated Area and its relentless pursuit and interception of our breakthrough troops have aroused infinite concern and anger among the wounded and sick comrades of the Central Plains Military Region who have been transferred here. When this newspaper's reporter visited the Central Bureau's reception center a few days ago, he happened to encounter them discussing the breakthrough of the Central Plains Military Region troops and the news of crossing the Han River, and their emotions were extremely agitated. They asked the reporter about the details of the Central Plains War and asked, "Is there any newer news?" Battalion Commander Ding Zheng told the reporter: "After reading the news of the Central Plains troops being forced to break through, we haven't been able to eat a meal all day!" He began to recount the heroic and arduous history of the Fifth Division's eight-year resistance in the Central Plains: Starting with the establishment of the army with 200 people in March 1939, under the leadership of Commander Li Xiannian, the Fifth Division fought bitterly with the enemy and puppets for eight years, developing into a strong force of tens of thousands of people, and established a vast liberated area, once containing 300,000 enemies. He said: "I spent eight years in the hail of bullets, never sleeping with my clothes off, never stationed in one place for three days, and never went five days without fighting. Even the division leaders were constantly on the move, never dismounting." When Ding was in the Jingmen area, he fought 36 large-scale battles with the enemy and puppets in four and a half months, and the smaller ones were countless. The frequency of battles in the Central Plains can be imagined. When they fought and marched, sometimes they traveled 300 miles in a day and a night, and often had nothing to eat. Once, 160 people made six liters of thin porridge to satisfy their hunger. The Central Plains has a lot of rain, and in battle, soldiers often had to burn green grass to smoke rice to fill their stomachs because they had no firewood. However, morale remained consistently high. After the Political Consultative Conference resolution, the Central Plains troops immediately carried out demobilization in order to implement the resolution. The demobilized soldiers were in tears and refused to leave, all saying: "We are willing to die for the people, and we are unwilling to leave the New Fourth Army." The leaders and comrades earnestly persuaded them to leave the team and return home. The sad parting made Battalion Commander Ding's eyes fill with tears even now when he talks about it. Battalion Commander Ding is very grateful for the all-round care of the leaders here. He said that among the four or five hundred of us who have returned, half have recovered their health and taken up new jobs. Some have joined the turn-over team, and some have joined the work of various departments of the Party, government, army, and people. The rest have joined the study and continued to recuperate. Finally, with the unwavering spirit of the New Fourth Army, he said passionately: "Although I am recuperating here, my heart misses the Central Plains day and night, and I am concerned about the cause of peace and democracy in the whole country. Although I have been wounded five times and have fourteen injuries, as long as I receive an order from the higher authorities, I will immediately take up my gun and go to the battlefield of self-defense!"

　　抵邯中原军区军官
    历尽艰辛苦战八年竟遭蒋军无理围歼
    痛述中原艰苦斗争史
    【本报讯】蒋军侵占我中原解放区并对我突围部队穷追堵击，引起转移此间之中原军区伤病员同志们无限关怀与愤怒，本社记者日前访问中央局招待所时；适遇彼等正展谈中原军区突围部和横渡汉水消息，情绪至为激昂。纷纷向记者询问中原战争的详情，并问“有没有更新的消息”。丁正营长对记者说：“读了中原部队被迫突围消息，我们一天没有吃下饭去！”他开始沉痛而兴奋地述说五师坚持中原八年抗战的英勇艰苦历史：从一九三九年三月二百人建军起，在李先念师长率领下与敌伪八年苦战，五师发展成一支数万人的坚强劲旅，建立了庞大的解放区，曾经牵制卅万敌人。他说：“我在枪林弹雨中过了八年，没有脱衣服睡过觉，没有在一个地点驻过三天，没有隔过五天不打仗，就是师首长们也从来是时常流动，马不离鞍。”丁在京山地区时，四个半月与敌伪大规模作战卅六次，小的就记不清了，中原战斗之频繁可以想见。他们打仗行军，有时一日一夜跑三百里，且常不得食，某次一百六十人，一天做了六升米的稀饭充饥；中原多雨，战斗中战士们常因没柴烧不得不以青草薰大米果腹。然而士气始终一贯高昂。政协决议后，中原部队为执行决议，立即进行复员，复员战士们涕泪沾襟坚不归去，都说：“愿为人民战死，不愿离开新四军。”首长及战友们殷切的劝他们离队归去，悲愤的别离之情，使丁营长至今说起犹热泪盈眶。丁营长非常感激此间首长们之百般关切，他说，我们回来的四五百人中，已有一半恢复健康走上新的工作岗位，有的参加翻身队，有的参加党政军民各部的工作，其余各部已参加学习和继续休养。末了他以新四军固定的坚决精神，激昂慷慨地说：“我虽然在这里休养，但是我的心却日夜思念着中原，挂念着全国和平民主事业，尽管我已挂过五次彩，带了十四处伤，但只要得到上级一个命令，我将立即持枪，走上自卫的战场！”    （田林）
