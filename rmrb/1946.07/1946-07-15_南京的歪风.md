　　The Unhealthy Trends in Nanjing
　　Chang Jiang

　　I spent a month in Nanjing, a tense summer. In June, although nature was generally calm, the edge of a hurricane that had passed through Fujian in late June only oscillated over Nanjing, leaving no earth-shattering traces for the people of Nanjing. However, from the perspective of political Nanjing, several major unhealthy trends swept from Nanjing in all directions.

　　My first impression upon arriving in Nanjing was the authorities' arrogance, a sense of "being the only one worthy of respect" and "being condescending." This "attitude" made someone accustomed to the equal, free, and democratic life of the liberated areas feel very uncomfortable. When Kuomintang representatives came to our liberated areas, we treated them with the courtesy of honored guests, providing them with generous material treatment, necessary personal care, and appropriate convenience in their work. However, our delegation in Nanjing lived in housing inferior to a Kuomintang 74th Army battalion headquarters, and their only means of transportation was a Jeep. The Democratic League's office space was even smaller. Negotiations were not conducted through consultation, but rather through issuing unilateral orders, not with mutual respect and concession, but with the demand that we "finally come to our senses." They wouldn't allow people to publish newspapers or magazines, silenced people's voices, and then accused them of "spreading falsehoods." They were obsessed with American weapons and readily called for "suppression of the rebellion."

　　The second major unhealthy trend was servility. Americans were treated like emperors, with American advisors receiving salaries larger than those of hundreds of Chinese civil servants. It was considered an honor to speak English when meeting Chinese people. They freely gifted inland river navigation rights, handed over customs administration to foreigners, and allowed American troops to operate arbitrarily in Chinese territorial waters and airspace without treaty basis. Even more surprising was that they wanted to give the "final decision-making power" to Americans on issues of Chinese internal affairs. This was not only stated verbally but even formally included in diplomatic documents! When the CCP and various sectors of society disagreed, they repeatedly urged the CCP to quickly accept this sovereignty-betraying approach through memoranda. Finally, after facing widespread opposition, Kuomintang newspapers even used "Marshal Ma" to intimidate people, saying that the CCP dared to oppose something that Marshal Ma had already agreed to, as if it were "utterly rebellious"!

　　The third was the trend of violence, represented by the "June 23rd" Xiaguan massacre. A Shanghai newspaper aptly stated, "Violence returns to the capital." The thugs are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Hundreds of people can encircle and beat a dozen unarmed elderly people and women, even repeatedly beating them up to four times. The freedom to beat people can last for several hours, demonstrating considerable "courage" and organization! The methods are also much more advanced. The thugs can claim to be "refugees from Northern Jiangsu" and avoid responsibility for the beatings. The investigation and research into beatings have also improved. The person who beat Mr. Gao Ji of Ta Kung Pao said, "I know you're a reporter for Ta Kung Pao. Your comments in Chongqing were frivolous," meaning he deserved to be beaten long ago. And the thug who beat Ms. Pu Xixiu of Xinmin News said, "I recognized you, Miss Pu, when you joined Xinmin News in the 26th year of the Republic!" It seems that he had been a "refugee" in Xiaguan ten years ago(?). He had already prepared to be a "refugee" before the establishment of a democratic government in Northern Jiangsu, in order to beat people! On June 25th, at a press conference held by Shanghai people's representatives in Nanjing, the thugs were also well-organized. Fortunately, elders like Mr. Jian Yanfang were well-mannered and didn't start a fight. The "refugees" had originally decided to hold a large demonstration on June 26th, claiming that they would beat up several newspaper offices and the organs of the CCP and the People's League. Later, due to strong opposition from all parties and the fact that they could not gather too many people, they decided to postpone the demonstration.

　　The unhealthy trends in Nanjing are gaining momentum, and improper currents are also blowing from Washington, further exacerbating the unhealthy trends in Nanjing. If these unhealthy trends are not stopped, China will suffer greatly! Correcting these unhealthy trends mainly relies on the liberated areas. Therefore, defending peace and the liberated areas is the most important task in the country at present. (July 1st, from Nanjing)

　　南京的歪风
　　长江
    在南京住了一月，这是紧张的夏天。六月，大自然界虽然大体上平静，六月下旬曾经到过福建的飓风，只有它的边缘震荡过南京的上空，没有给南京人留下翻天覆地迹印。可是从政治的南京说，几股大歪风却从南京吹到四方。
    到南京第一个印象，是当局的骄风，“唯我独尊”、“盛气凌人”等等“气概”，使过惯了解放区平等自由民主生活的人，感到很不舒服。国民党的代表们到我们解放区，我们是以上宾之礼相待，给他们以物资上的优厚的待遇，人情上以必要的照顾，工作上于应有的便利；然而，我们的代表团在南京，住的房子不如国民党七十四军一个营部，交通工具只有了一部吉普车。民主同盟的办事处，房子更少。谈判也不很好用协商办法，动辄单独下命令，不是互尊互让，而是要我们“最后觉悟”。不允许人家出报纸、杂志，封了人家嘴，还说人家“造假”。迷信美国武器，动辄就要“戡乱”。
    第二股大歪风，是奴风。把美国人奉为太上皇，美国顾问薪水，比百把个中国公务员还大，见了中国人也以说英语为荣。内河航行权自己奉赠，海关又交给外人管理，美军无条约根据，驻在中国领海、领空，让他们任意横行。更出人意外的，是对于中国内政问题，要把“最后决定权”交给美国人。这不仅出之于口，而竟正式出之外交文件！中共和各界人士都不同意时，竟再三用备忘录来催促，要中共赶快承认这断送主权的办法。最后遭到大家反对后，国民党报纸上竟拿“马帅”来吓人，说马帅都已同意的事，中共竟敢反对，好像“大逆不道”！
    第三是打风，“六·二三”下关惨案，就是代表。上海有一家报纸说：“打风还都”，确是一针见血。打手们越来越有进步，几百个人可以围殴十几个手无寸铁的老人与妇女，连打至四次之多，自由打人可达数小时之久，可见“勇气”与组织均很可观！手法上也高明多了，打手们可以自称“苏北难民”，打了也可以不负责。打人的调查研究也有进步，打大公报高集先生的人说：“我晓得你是大公报记者，你在重庆的言论就是吊儿浪当”，意思是早就该打。而打新民报浦熙修先生的打手说：“你民国廿六年进新民报时，我就认得你浦小姐了！”可见他十年前已经在下关作“难民”（？）苏北未建立民主政权时，他已经预作“难民”，以便打人了！六月二十五日，上海人民代表在南京的招待记者会上，打手们也布置得很好，总算简延芳老先生等修养好，没有打起来。“难民”们本来还决定在六月二十六日大游行，声言还要打几家报馆和中共人民盟的机关，后来各方坚决反对，而且他们也集合不起太多的人，才算决定延期游行。
    南京的歪风正吹得起劲，从华盛顿那边也正吹来了不正当的气流，它更加重了南京的歪风。这些歪风不制止，中国要遭大殃！纠正这些歪风，主要只有依靠解放区，因此保卫和平与解放区，成为目前全国最主要的工作。（七月一日自南京）
