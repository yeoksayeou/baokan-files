[Handan, 26th Dispatch] Zhao Shuli, Feng Shiyun, Peng Qingzhao and twenty-two other mass culture workers from the Border Region, along with more than ten mass publications such as Xin Dazhong, Dazhong Kexue, Gong Nong Bing, and Nongmin Banyuekan, upon hearing that Mr. Li Furen had escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an, sent a special telegram of condolences. The telegram stated: "You have escaped danger and come to Yan'an. This is a victory for the people's strength. We welcome you. Your statement, 'Assassination is suicide,' is a very good dirge for the Chinese reactionaries' secret agents. The blood of the Chinese people will not be shed in vain. Let thousands upon thousands of democratic fighters rise up to sing for the demise of the Chinese reactionary dictators! Let us fight for a new China of independence, peace, and democracy!"
