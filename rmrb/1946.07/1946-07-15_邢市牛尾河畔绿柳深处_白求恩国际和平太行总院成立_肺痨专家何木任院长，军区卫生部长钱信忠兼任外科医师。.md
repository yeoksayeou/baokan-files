　　Xing City, on the banks of the Niuwei River, in the depths of green willows
　　Bethune International Peace Taihang General Hospital Established
　　He Mu, a tuberculosis expert, serves as the president, and Qian Xinzhong, the health minister of the military region, concurrently serves as a surgeon.
　　[Reported by our newspaper from Xingtai] After three months of active preparation, the Bethune International Peace Hospital Taihang General Hospital was officially established in Xingtai City in early July. The hospital president, He Mu, is a Chinese tuberculosis expert and former president of the Yan'an Peace Hospital. The surgeon is Qian Xinzhong, the health minister of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. Pediatrician Tian Ping graduated from South Manchuria Medical College. Otolaryngologist An Zhongyan graduated from Baoding Medical College in his early years and was formerly the director of the medical department of the 30th Army. Obstetrician and gynecologist Yu Guoqi graduated from Pingda Medical College and came to the liberated area from Beiping not long ago to participate in the work. In addition, there are nine interns and fifty-nine nurses. The number of beds can accommodate 120 people at the beginning, and it is planned to gradually expand to 250. It mainly provides acute treatment; chronic diseases are limited to those with unclear diagnoses. The hospital has a laboratory and equipment such as X-ray machines and obstetrical forceps, which are currently being repaired and installed, and will continue to be purchased from other areas. The site is located in the old site of the Provincial Fourth Normal School in front of Beiguan, which was later occupied by the puppet army Gao Delin as a barracks. It is next to the Niuwei River, surrounded by water on all four sides, with weeping willows, quiet and refreshing. During the construction of the hospital buildings, all staff members fully demonstrated the spirit of hard work and actively participated in carrying bricks, building walls, and digging pits, and tried to save expenses. For example, using old bricks from the city wall as pillars in the house can replace wood, which is strong, beautiful, and saves money. All the bedding and work clothes in the wards are sewn by the female comrades of the hospital. President He personally led the mixing of mud and the installation of electric lights, caring for the work of every department like caring for patients. Many people do not take a nap, and do not rest on Sundays, in order to complete the work as soon as possible and receive patients. A work summary was recently conducted and fifteen model workers emerged. All comrades in the hospital deeply felt that in the arduous preparation work, they strengthened unity, overcame difficulties, and improved their thinking of serving the people. (Elephant)
