　　Striking Back at the Yan Pseudo-Army's Offensive
　　Masses in Jinzhong Rise Up in Self-Defense
　　Shijiazhuang Militia Repulses Enemy Twenty Times Their Size
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 9th] Amidst the Yan army's offensive, the masses in various counties of Jinzhong have organized themselves to defend their homes. In Fenyang, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Xiaoyi and other places, thousands of militia members have formed combat teams and home defense teams to protect the wheat harvest. The militia of three districts in Yangqu and Jiaocheng have jointly established a self-defense committee, implementing joint operations and establishing several mine blockade lines stretching dozens of miles to protect their homes and property. The Yan pseudo-army has continuously invaded Dahuicun in Xiaoyi, and all young and middle-aged men in the village have joined the militia self-defense team to protect their hometown. On the 19th of last month, more than 300 Yan pseudo-soldiers stationed in strongholds such as Sima Town and Tiantun Town, equipped with mortars, light and heavy machine guns, launched a three-pronged attack on Shijiazhuang in Pingjie. The village militia engaged in fierce fighting with the Yan pseudo-army, who outnumbered them by more than twenty to one, valiantly repelling their five assaults. The masses in various places have all bravely assisted the militia in combat. In Jiaocheng, all men aged 20 to 55 have joined stretcher teams and transport teams, braving artillery fire to rescue the wounded and transport supplies. Four young men from Mijiazhuang carried wounded soldiers through the Yan pseudo-army's artillery fire, three of them were wounded, but they still rescued the wounded soldiers.
