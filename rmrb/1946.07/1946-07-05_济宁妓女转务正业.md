　　Jining Prostitutes
    Transfer to Legitimate Occupations
    [Our newspaper's Heze dispatch] In order to relieve the suffering of prostitutes and promote their shift to legitimate occupations, the Jining First District Union convened a prostitutes' conference on the morning of the 14th of last month at the Yuhua Stage. Chang Fengxian, a prostitute who was liberated with the support of the democratic government, reported on her suffering and liberation process, which evoked painful memories from more than 70 prostitutes present. It aroused their demands for liberation. Some, recalling their own pain, cried incessantly on the spot. In addition to comforting them at the time, our democratic government promised to continue to help them change their professions and engage in labor production in order to achieve liberation.
