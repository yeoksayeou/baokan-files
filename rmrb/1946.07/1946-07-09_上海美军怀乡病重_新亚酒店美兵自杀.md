　　Shanghai American Soldiers Severely Homesick
    American Soldier Commits Suicide in New Asia Hotel

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th—According to Shanghai United Evening News: Recently, the American soldiers stationed in Shanghai have almost all become severely homesick. On the afternoon of June 29th, in the American military dormitory of the New Asia Hotel, an American military policeman cut his left and right wrist veins and committed suicide. After being rescued by American expatriates, he regained consciousness slightly. When asked why he committed suicide, he replied: "Japan has surrendered for a long time, and their expeditionary mission is over. Now the Chinese people hope they will go home, and they themselves are eager to return. However, the American authorities want them to stay in China. They cannot disobey orders and can only go to God to relieve this endless pain."

　　上海美军怀乡病重
    新亚酒店美兵自杀
    【新华社延安六日电】据上海联合晚报载：近来驻上海的美国兵，几乎都害了深重的怀乡病。六月二十九日下午，新亚酒店美军宿舍内，有一美国宪兵用刀割破左右手脉膊自杀，经美侨救济后，稍为清醒，问他为什么自杀，他答：“日本已经投降很久了，他们远征的任务也已完毕，现在中国老百姓希望他们回家，他们自己也归心似箭，而美国当局却要他们留在中国，他们不能违抗命令，只有到上帝那里解脱此无尽期的痛苦”。
