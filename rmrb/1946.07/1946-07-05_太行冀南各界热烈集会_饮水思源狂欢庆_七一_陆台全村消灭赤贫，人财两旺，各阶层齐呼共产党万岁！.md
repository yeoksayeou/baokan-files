【Our Special Dispatch】Taihang and Southern Hebei both warmly celebrated the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Directly subordinate organs of the Taihang Military Region held a cadre meeting of 5,000 people, followed by discussions on Chairman Mao's statement and future tasks. The Taihang Xinhua Daily also summarized the achievements of the New Heroism campaign in the museum over the past month. More than 3,000 workers and shop assistants in Xingtai City, who had increased their capital, also held a grand gathering at the New China Grand Theater in Nanguan to celebrate the birth of their vanguard and resolutely stated: they will always follow Chairman Mao and oppose the imperialist conspiracy of the United States assisting Chiang in the civil war. The masses in Rencun, Licheng, who had been emancipated, held a heart-to-heart memorial evening to remember the source of their happiness. Hired laborer Nan Tongshun said very happily: "I was a farmhand for fifteen years, and only after the Communist Party came did I become emancipated and have more than ten acres of land. Today's life is truly the day when we poor people stand out." The newly emerging rich peasant Shen Dazang, who could not get enough to eat or wear before the war, has now achieved a surplus of more than half of his cultivated land. He said, "I can never forget that this benefit was given to me by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." Businessman Li Fuzai said: "In the past, I ran a fur business, and the old government often confiscated my goods on the pretext of tax evasion, and my business collapsed like that. Now the government has abolished all kinds of exorbitant taxes and specially supports commerce, so my business has recovered again. Comparing the past with the present, these are truly two different worlds!" Particularly happy was the woman Ji Xiaohuan. In the old society, she was sold twice by her parents and husband. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, she truly enjoys the happiness of freedom and equality. The masses in Dongdouzhuang and Xihou villages in Shexian County commemorated the birthday of the great Communist Party with the practical action of launching a warm weeding competition to cultivate more labor heroes and model mutual aid groups. Farmers in the newly liberated areas of Changzhi, Heshun, and Wu'an wrote letters to Chairman Mao with the greatest joy, reporting their experiences of emancipation and the benefits they had received. People in villages along the borders of the Northern Henan liberated area and in areas under Kuomintang rule also wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, accusing the Kuomintang army of the monstrous crimes they had committed against them. In the Southern Hebei area, on this day, cadres from various organs and groups not only conducted an in-depth examination of Li Zicheng's thoughts but also cleared up the ideological obstacles to the development of mass movement production in the area. The eight million emancipated farmers in the entire area were even more jubilant, holding meetings to congratulate Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The masses in Lu Tai Village, who had become prosperous in both population and wealth after emancipation, unanimously praised the achievements of eradicating extreme poverty in the entire village under the leadership of the Communist Party in the "thinking meetings." During the meeting, all classes chanted the slogan "Long Live the Communist Party!" Zhenghe Village, which had a bumper harvest of summer wheat, now had new wheat filling every household's threshing ground. There were no more beggars in the whole village, and no more idlers wandering the streets. The two thousand or so men and women celebrated the birthday of the Communist Party with infinite gratitude and love for gaining a happy home. The masses in Sangzhuang Village in Weixian County automatically weeded the fields for the families of soldiers for a day, and the women rushed to make more than twenty pairs of new shoes to comfort the soldiers at the front, expressing their love and respect for the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party.
