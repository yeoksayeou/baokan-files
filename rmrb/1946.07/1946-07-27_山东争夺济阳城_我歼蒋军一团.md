Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 24th—A fierce battle for Jiyang City, ten miles northeast of Jinan, has occurred. After Chiang's troops, invading from Jinan, captured Jiyang City on the 5th, they engaged in extensive burning, killing, looting, and rushed to build fortifications, preparing to continue their northward expansion. The local Eighth Route Army began a counterattack on the evening of the 16th. After 36 hours of intense fighting, the city was recovered on the morning of the 18th. The entire 106th Regiment of the New 36th Division of Chiang's 12th Army was annihilated, with over 600 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, including the regimental commander. Over 400 were captured alive, including the deputy regimental commander. Over 700 rifles and machine guns and six cannons of various types were seized. That afternoon, the 107th and 108th Regiments of Chiang's New 36th Division, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, repeatedly launched fierce attacks and recaptured the city. The Bohai Eighth Route Army is still continuing to resist in the suburbs of the city. In the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, Chiang's 8th Army, 96th Army, and part of the 73rd Army, aided by four aircraft, invaded and captured Boshan City along the Zibo Railway in three routes on the 11th. They are now plundering Zibo's coal production and concentrating their forces to protect the Jiaoji Railway.
