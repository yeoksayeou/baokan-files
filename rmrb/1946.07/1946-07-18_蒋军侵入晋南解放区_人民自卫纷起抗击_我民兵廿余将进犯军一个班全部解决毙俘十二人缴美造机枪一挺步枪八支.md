　　Chiang Troops Invade the Jinan Liberated Area
    People's Self-Defense Rises Up to Resist
    Our Militia Completely Annihilates a Platoon of Invading Troops with Just Over Twenty Soldiers, Killing and Capturing Twelve, Seizing One American-Made Machine Gun and Eight Rifles
    [Reported from Yangcheng on the 15th by Our Newspaper] The Kuomintang troops invading the Jinan Liberated Area have been met with resistance from the local people everywhere. Since the Kuomintang's 47th Division invaded the Zhang (dian) Mao (jin) Highway, the people of the Xiaxian and Pinglu Liberated Areas have first picked up weapons to resolutely defend themselves, causing the 47th Division, which was advancing north along the Zhangmao Road, to be strongly blocked by guerrillas and militia along the way, especially in Ma'geba, Maojin and other places. On the 6th, a unit of more than 20 of our militia completely annihilated a platoon of Chiang's troops stationed at Maojin Fort, killing five and capturing seven, seizing an American-made machine gun and eight rifles. The militia in various places were even more encouraged upon hearing the news. The morale of Chiang's soldiers is very low. Whenever they hear our gunshots, they dare not continue to advance. In Ma'geba, Chiang's soldiers, although urged by their officers with pistols to charge at us more than ten times, were all repelled by our militia.
    [Reported from Handan on the 13th by Our Newspaper] The Yongnian Executive Group began negotiations on the issue of the transfer of puppet troops in Yongnian City on the 29th of last month. Regarding the withdrawal date, withdrawal steps, transit route, and food supply of the puppet troops, a satisfactory solution has been largely reached with our side faithfully implementing the orders of the Beiping Executive Headquarters and making repeated concessions. Only the transportation problem remains. Our representatives originally stated that the Yongnian puppet troops were heinous bandits and traitors. Now that the puppet troops are being transferred without leaving behind weapons, asking the people of Yongnian to mobilize vehicles for transportation is something the people will not allow. Finally, our representatives, taking the overall situation into consideration, agreed to reluctantly hire vehicles to transport the wounded, sick, and family members of the puppet troops. However, Mr. Zhang Chaozheng, Lieutenant Colonel of the Kuomintang representative, actually proposed 2,000 carts. Major Mickey, the American representative, also said with a smile: "The garrison in Yongnian City is only a little over a thousand. Do you need so many vehicles? Are you planning to move Yongnian City away?" Therefore, the negotiations, which were about to reach an agreement, were disrupted by this unreasonable demand of the Kuomintang and declared terminated. Since the beginning of the negotiations to date, the Kuomintang representatives have signed the Yongnian Truce Agreement, but the Kuomintang's bombing of the people of Yongnian has not stopped, and has become increasingly serious. Now that this matter has not reached an agreement, it clearly proves that the Kuomintang has no sincerity in the negotiations, but is only using the negotiations to delay time.

　　蒋军侵入晋南解放区
    人民自卫纷起抗击
    我民兵廿余将进犯军一个班全部解决毙俘十二人缴美造机枪一挺步枪八支
    【本报阳城十五日电】侵入晋南解放区的国民党军，已到处遭到当地人民的抗击。自国民党军四十七师侵入张（店）茅（津）公路时，夏县、平陆解放区人民即首先拿起武器坚决自卫，致沿张茅路北犯的四十七师沿途遭到游击队民兵的有力阻击，尤以马圪坝、茅津等地为烈。六日，我一部民兵二十余人，一次即将盘踞茅津堡的蒋军哨兵一个班全部解决，击毙五人，生俘七人，缴美造机枪一挺，步枪八支，各地民兵闻讯更为振奋。蒋军士兵士气十分低落，每闻我枪声时，即不敢继续前进，在马圪坝，蒋军士兵虽在长官的手枪督促下向我冲锋十余次，但均为我民兵击退。
    【本报邯郸十三日电】永年执行小组对永年城内伪军转移问题，自上月二十九日开始谈判，关于伪军撤退日期，撤退步骤，通过路线及食粮等问题，在我方忠实执行北平执行部命令与一再让步之下，已大致获得圆满解决。仅余运输问题，我方代表原表示：永年伪军原系罪大恶极之土匪汉奸，现该伪军转移既不留下武器，而要永年人民动员车辆输送，实为人民所不许。最后我方代表为顾全大局，同意勉力酌雇输送伤病员及伪军眷属之车辆，但国方代表张朝正中校，竟提出要大车两千辆。美方代表麦奇少校亦笑谓：“永年城内驻军不过千余，要这样多车辆，是否准备把永年城搬走？”因此，行将达成协议之谈判，竟因国方这一无理要求横生枝节，而宣告停止。按自开始谈判以来到目前为止，国方代表曾签字永年休战协议，但国民党飞机轰炸永年人民并未间断，且日甚一日，现此事又未达成协议，显然证明国方对谈判毫无诚意，不过以谈判拖延时间而已。
