Handan City Organs Enthusiastically Study the "July 7th" Declaration
Commander Liu Delivers Mobilization Report
Handan Middle School Designates Declaration as Main Study Subject; Comrade Panshi of this Newspaper Guides Study and Answers Questions
[This newspaper's Handan News]: The CCP's "July 7th" Declaration has sparked enthusiastic discussions in various organs and schools in Handan City. To further assist cadres in studying the declaration, Commander Liu Bocheng of the Military Region delivered a report on the study of the declaration on the 10th at the Handan City Stadium, addressing over 4,000 Party and non-Party cadres from directly subordinate units of the military region, directly subordinate units of the central government, directly subordinate units of the border region, and various organs and groups in Handan City. Commander Liu stated in his report: Today, China is in a serious situation where American reactionaries and Chinese reactionaries are jointly attacking the Chinese people. Only by uniting and resolutely fighting against the reactionaries can the Chinese people finally achieve victory. Commander Liu recounted that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries retreated without a fight, abandoning the people of North China and retreating across the Yellow River. The Eighth Route Army shared life and death with the elders and brothers of North China, persevering in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. In an extremely harsh environment, our people behind enemy lines shed much blood and sweat and paid a great price to create the liberated areas for 144 million people. Our sole purpose in fighting was for China's independence, peace, and democracy. However, American imperialists and Chinese reactionaries, one wanting military intervention and the other wanting military dictatorship, combined to prevent the Chinese people from achieving independence, peace, and democracy. At this critical moment of national crisis, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized a million troops to encircle and attack the Central Plains, eastern Henan, and southern Shanxi liberated areas, and the Jinpu Railway line, dispatching air force to bomb. Yan Xishan used Japanese bandits to continue attacking Yuci and Taiyuan. Chiang Kai-shek signed a ceasefire agreement with one hand and tore it up with the other. This serious situation of civil war was entirely caused by the support of American reactionaries. But how can we defeat the attacks of Chinese and foreign reactionaries and truly realize national independence, peace, and democracy? Commander Liu pointed out that we must adhere to the four demands in the declaration: immediately implement an unconditional ceasefire, reopen the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), implement disarmament and demobilization under the supervision of the PCC, demand that the United States immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, and implement the declaration of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on non-interference in China's internal affairs. How can we make our struggle victorious? Commander Liu pointed out that the most fundamental issue is to liberate the people, to rely on the people. Only when the people truly become masters and no longer slaves can the people stand up and fight against imperialism and fascism, and finally defeat the enemy. Finally, Commander Liu reiterated that our future is bright. Although there are domestic and foreign reactionaries attacking the people, there are also broad domestic and international democratic forces standing on the same battle line with us, especially the power of the people in the liberated areas has been unprecedentedly developed. However, Commander Liu also specially cautioned everyone that in the face of victory, we must guard against arrogance and firmly remember Chairman Mao's golden words: "Unite ourselves to defeat the enemy," so that we will not suffer losses. (End)

[Another News] Various organs in Handan City and all students of Handan Middle School are currently discussing the "July 7th" Declaration in conjunction with Commander Liu's report. Handan Middle School regards the declaration as the main subject of current affairs learning for the entire school. Cadres of the Border Region Health Bureau are also seizing the time to study the declaration in their spare time from treatment.

[This Newspaper's News] After the publication of the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" Declaration, the comrades of this newspaper and the Xinhua General Branch, in order to implement the spirit of the declaration in their work, the entire organization, under the call of the Study Committee, conducted reading and informal discussions in groups on the morning of the day after the declaration was issued, and launched enthusiastic discussions on the following issues: (1) From the slogans of "independence, peace, and democracy" proposed in the declaration, what understanding should we have of the current national crisis in China and what attitude should we take? (2) What is the understanding of the ambiguous relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism and its development prospects? (3) What is the understanding of the four demands in the declaration, and how can we achieve their realization? After five days of debate, Comrade Panshi gave another report on the study of the declaration, explaining the declaration paragraph by paragraph and answering the unresolved questions of each group, which quickly improved the study of each group. Currently, all cadres are stepping up their detailed study of each paragraph.

　　邯市各机关热烈学习“七七”宣言
    刘司令员作动员报告
    邯中定宣言为目前学习主要课目本报磐石同志指导学习解答疑难
    【本报邯郸讯】：中共“七七”宣言已在邯市各机关各学校中引起热烈讨论。为了进一步帮助各干部对宣言的学习，军区刘伯承司令员，特于十日在邯市体育场，向军直、中直、边直及邯市各机关团体四千余位党与非党干部，进行宣言学习的报告，刘司令员报告首称：今天中国正处在美国反动派与中国反动派联合向中国人民进攻的严重局面，我们中国人民，只有团结一致和反动派进行坚决的斗争，才能最后取得胜利。刘司令员追述抗战之初国民党反动派不战而退，抛弃华北人民退过黄河。八路军与华北父老兄弟同生死共患难，坚持了八年的抗日战争，在极残酷的环境下，我们敌后人民流了不少血汗，付出了很大的代价，才创造了一万万四千万人民的解放区。我们奋斗的唯一目的，是为了中国的独立、和平与民主，但美帝国主义者与中国反动派一个要军事干涉，一个要军事独裁，他们结合起来不让中国人民获得独立、和平与民主。在此民族危机严重时机下，蒋介石调动了百万大军围攻中原、豫东、晋南解放区，津浦沿线，出动空军轰炸，阎锡山利用日寇继续进攻榆太，蒋介石一手签订了停战协定，一手又将它撕毁，这种严重的内战局面，完全由于美国反动派的支持所造成。但是要怎样才能打败中外反动派的进攻，真正实现全国的独立和平与民主呢？刘司令员指出必须坚持宣言中四项主张，立即实施无条件停战，重开政协会议，在政协监督下实行裁军复员，要求美国立即撤退驻华军队，实践莫斯科三外长会议不干涉中国内政之宣言。怎样使我们的斗争能获得胜利呢？刘司令员指出最基本的问题要使人民翻身，要依靠人民，只有人民真正作了主人，不再当奴隶，人民才能站立起来和帝国主义法西斯作斗争，最后才能战胜敌人。最后刘司令员复指出我们的前途是光明的，虽然有国内和国外的反动派向人民进攻，但也有广大的国内外民主人民力量和我们站在一条战线上战斗，特别是解放区人民力量得到了空前的发展，但刘司令员也特别告诫大家在胜利的面前，必需力戒骄傲，牢记毛主席：“团结自己战胜敌人”，这句金石之言，才不至吃亏。（语）
    【又讯】邯市各机关及邯郸中学全体学生，目前正把“七七”宣言结合刘司令员报告进行讨论，邯郸把宣言当成全校时事学习的主要课目，边区卫生局干部们，亦于每天治疗之暇，抓紧进行宣言学习。
    【本报讯】中共中央“七七”宣言公布后，本报与新华总分社的同志们，为了把宣言精神贯彻到工作中去，全馆于宣言发布的次日早晨，即在学委会的号召下分组进行了阅读、漫谈并对下述问题展开了热烈的讨论。（一）从宣言所提“独立、和平、民主”的口号中，我们对目前中国的民族危机，应作何认识并采取什么态度？（二）对蒋介石与美帝国主义所发生的暧昧关系的认识及其发展前途如何？（三）对宣言中四项主张的认识，以及如何才能求其实现？经过五天争论后，磐石同志又向大家作了一次宣言学习报告，将宣言逐段加以解释并解答了各组争论未决的问题，使各组学习迅速提高了一步，现全体干部，正加紧进行逐段精读。
