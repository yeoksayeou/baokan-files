Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 19th. In protest against Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable demand that the Communist army withdraw from Jehol, the 3,000 Hui people of Chengde held a patriotic conference for the protection of religion and sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek. The original telegram is as follows:

Chiang, Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, may your honor be advised: The Eighth Route Army, which is loyal to national equality, liberated Jehol, allowing us 3,000 Hui people in Chengde to stand up after being oppressed by Han chauvinism and to live a happy life for ten months. Today, you are unreasonably demanding that the Eighth Route Army withdraw from Rehe and Chahar, which truly shows your intention to be an enemy of the Hui people. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have fought bitterly for us for eight years and are now helping us establish Hui middle schools, primary schools, Hui cooperatives, the Hui National Construction Association, and the Hui Detachment, enabling our political, economic, and cultural life to develop vigorously. You abandoned us thirteen years ago and ran all the way to Mount Emei. We never saw a single Kuomintang soldier when we were slaves of the country. Now, you are using American guns and cannons to attack and seize territory outside the passes. We firmly oppose you turning the Northeast into an American "Manchukuo" and oppose you becoming the second Puyi. We demand that your troops completely withdraw from Jehol. It is absolutely impossible for you to threaten the autonomous life of our Hui people. Chengde Hui Patriotic Association for the Protection of Religion.

    电蒋抗议无理要求
    你十三年前就丢下我们不管今天却拿美武器来攻城夺地
    【新华社承德十九日电】为抗议蒋介石所提中共军撤出热河之无理要求，承德市三千回民举行的护教爱国大会，特驰电蒋介石，原电如下：
    南京国府蒋主席钧鉴：忠于民族平等的八路军解放了热河，使我们承市三千回民，在大汉族主义的压迫下翻身，在幸福生活中过了十个月。今天你竟无理要求八路军撤离热察，真是有意与回民为敌。共产党八路军为我们苦战八年，现在又帮助我们建立回民中学、小学、回民合作社、回民建国会和回民支队，使我们的政治、经济、文化生活能够踊跃发展。你十三年前就丢下我们不管，一口气跑到峨嵋山，我们当亡国奴的时候，从没有见过一个国民党的军队。现在你却拿着美国的枪炮，到关外来攻城夺地。我们坚决反对你把东北变成美国的“满洲国”，反对你来当溥仪第二，我们要求你的军队完全撤出热河，你想威胁我们回民的自治生活是绝对不行的。承德市回民护教爱国大会启。
