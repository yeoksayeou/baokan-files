(Reported by our newspaper from Heze) The liberated peasants of Boping, with a high degree of conscious enthusiasm, have formed shock troops and gone out of their villages to assist in the battle. They are making every effort to mobilize and organize the vast number of peasants who have not yet been liberated to overthrow the rule of traitors, despots, and landlords. This has opened up the narrow and dull situation of the past simple tenant farmer movement, and the mass movement in the whole county has achieved unprecedented rapid development. In the Fourth District, in May and June, the liberated peasants of Suanzi Lizhuang, a key village, formed a large team of sixty or seventy people, and carried out full-scale attacks on the surrounding villages one by one. After breaking through one village, they left two people to help, and then went to another village to attack. When the large team entered each village, they carried flags and beat drums. Those with relatives looked for relatives, and those with acquaintances looked for acquaintances, to quickly understand the common and individual pains and demands, spread the news of the victory of the peasant struggle in other places, and encourage everyone to organize and carry out the struggle. The young activists in the large team gathered the children of each village to sing songs of the peasant liberation struggle, which immediately turned the atmosphere in the village from silence to excitement. Using this powerful "great march" blitzkrieg tactic, they quickly broke through Liqiao, Fengzhuang, Fengying, Hezi, Zhangzhuang and other villages, and each village immediately organized more than 20 to 40 members. Fengzhuang previously had only ten or so members, who were all afraid of a change in the political climate and had no leaders; after an afternoon of blitzkrieg, the peasant association developed to more than forty people, leaders were also produced, and the masses enthusiastically demanded to struggle against the local bully. They said: "Before, we didn't know where to turn our heads or where to go; with your arrival, we all feel that there are roads everywhere, and it's all bright!" Fengying organized more than twenty members in one night, and within a few days began to struggle against the traitors and local bullies, achieving victory. In the Second District, the liberated peasants of Wujia Hutong also used the same method to break through Xiaojinzhuang in two hours, Chenzhuang in four days, and Lijia Market in three days, all of which developed peasant associations and jointly overthrew the puppet district chief Li Shangyou. The shock troops of liberated peasants in Hanzhong, Third District, numbered more than eighty people, and continuously attacked Mizhuang and the former three camps of Lang, Si, Zhang, Lu, and Feng, and the latter three camps of Man, Xia, and Yuan. The anti-traitor and anti-local bully struggles rapidly stirred up the whole district. Many villages rose up in response to the news, and started on their own without waiting for a blitzkrieg or help. In the Seventh District, Yuzhuang used a forty-person shock team to break through Lizhao and Anzhuang in two days, and Pang Guantun in four days. In the First District, with the peasants of Yuanlou as the main force, a shock army of dozens of people was also concentrated. Their method was to divide into groups of five to ten people, and set out separately to attack several villages at the same time; their slogan was: "We have liberated ourselves, and we must help other oppressed brothers to liberate themselves! Only when everyone has enough to eat will we have strength!" In their separate attacks, they broke through Mengcun, Zhouzhuang, and Wuzhuang in two to four days, and even Liu Tanzhuang and Dahezhuang, which were known as stubborn fortresses. Wangmazi Village in the Fourth District also opened up the situation in this way. According to statistics from the county in late May, within half a month, 450 villages (approximately 60% of the total number of villages) were involved in the struggle, and the number of members of workers', peasants', and women's organizations increased rapidly from 6,000 to more than 20,000.
