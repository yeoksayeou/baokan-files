Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 25th—In the newly liberated areas of the northern Datong-Puzhou Railway, social order has been rapidly restored. Important towns along the railway, such as Daiyue, Hangang, Yuanping, and Xinkou, have established new regimes through people's democratic elections. The counties of Dai County and Fanshi have successively convened meetings of industrial and commercial circles to organize federations of industry and commerce. In Guoxian County, more than 230 businesses have resumed operations. Dai County held a mass rally of 10,000 people to celebrate liberation; the night was brilliantly lit, with firecrackers set off everywhere, and laughter filled the entire city. In the town of Fanshi, several thousand people also gathered to celebrate. Local democratic governments are distributing clothing and food to the disaster-stricken people, and farmers from the surrounding villages are flocking to the city to visit relatives and congratulate each other on their new life.
