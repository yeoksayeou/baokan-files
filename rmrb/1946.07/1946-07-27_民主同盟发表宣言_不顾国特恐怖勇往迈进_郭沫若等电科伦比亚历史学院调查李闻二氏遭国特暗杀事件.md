Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: According to a foreign news agency report from Shanghai: The China Democratic League has issued a declaration regarding the assassination of two Central Committee members, Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, particularly expressing that the Democratic League will not retreat due to the terror of assassinations, will never be afraid of such brutal and savage acts, and will move forward with even greater courage. The declaration also calls upon the people of the entire nation and the world to support the cause of justice and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: According to foreign news agency reports: Prominent representatives of Chinese cultural circles, including Guo Moruo, Tao Xingzhi, Ma Xulun, Ba Jin, Tian Han, Zheng Zhenduo, and more than thirty others, have telegraphed the Columbia History Academy, requesting them to send representatives to investigate the tragic assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, prominent leaders of the Chinese democratic movement, by Kuomintang secret agents. The telegram stated: The assassinations of Li and Wen prove the intensification of the barbaric atrocities of the Chinese reactionaries. The telegram listed the contributions of Li and Wen during the War of Resistance Against Japan and pointed out that the lives of many representatives of Chinese cultural circles are in danger because the reactionaries are plotting to maintain their dictatorial rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: Tianjin News: The Ta Kung Pao here published a special dispatch from London on the 19th, stating: Two political assassinations, Li and Wen, occurred in Kunming within a week, causing more concern here about the Chinese situation. The Times of London mentioned these two in a commentary, believing they were liberals who advocated democracy, and worried that such assassinations "will become another sinister factor in China's tragic warfare." The newspaper said: "There are bound to be elements in the Kuomintang who hate the Communists even more deeply than they hate Japan," and pointed out that "the Democratic League has aroused the anger of this group because of its constant advocacy of establishing a democratic coalition government."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: Nanjing News: After the representatives of the Communist Party of China and the Democratic League exposed the truth about the Li and Wen tragedies, the Kuomintang authorities tried to cover it up. Starting from the 18th, the Central News Agency sent telegrams in succession to defend Chen Lifu, the notorious head of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (CC Bureau), claiming that Zhou Enlai's factual exposure "should bear political and legal responsibility," attempting to divert attention and shirk responsibility in order to continue implementing its terror plans to assassinate democratic leaders throughout the country. At the same time, a news blockade was implemented, strictly prohibiting Kuomintang district newspapers from publishing the truth, and the Central News Agency refused to rebroadcast the CPC and Democratic League's talks and protests regarding the case. However, there was a glitch in the middle. On the 21st, the Central News Agency broadcasted the Democratic League's person in charge's talk in Nanjing, after distorting and deleting it. The original text is as follows: "Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: The Democratic League held a press conference at 4 pm today regarding the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. Luo Longji first reported the process of the two cases, directly pointing out that they were political assassinations. It is said that: Before this case is investigated, we cannot judge, but we believe that firstly, it is obviously a political assassination, and secondly, the government has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect. Luo continued: We advocate a prompt investigation. The Democratic League also requests to participate in the investigation, send legal experts to participate in the trial, and publicize the facts of the case to the society, and again request the cancellation of secret services. Luo also said: The Democratic League has today sent a letter to the government's Political Consultative Conference representatives to forward it to Chairman Chiang, explaining our above-mentioned attitude. Liang Shuming added: The government representatives have expressed no refusal to our request to participate in the investigation and trial, but we hope that the government will quickly find out the truth of the case. Luo and Liang then answered many questions from reporters, and the meeting adjourned at 5 pm." The matter was learned by a certain important person, who immediately flew into a rage and severely reprimanded the person in charge of the Central News Agency, and the agency immediately issued a notice to revoke the aforementioned telegram in full.

　　民主同盟发表宣言
    不顾国特恐怖勇往迈进
    郭沫若等电科伦比亚历史学院调查李闻二氏遭国特暗杀事件
    【新华社延安二十四日电】据上海外国通讯社报导：中国民主同盟顷为李公朴、闻一多两中委被刺一事发表宣言，特别表示民主同盟是不会因暗杀的恐怖而退却，绝不会害怕这种残暴野蛮的行为，且将以更大的勇气向前迈进。宣言并向全国及全世界人民呼吁支持正义及和平的事业。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】据外国通讯社报导：中国文化界著名代表郭沫若、陶行知、马序伦、芭盾、田汉、郑振铎等三十余人，顷致电科伦比亚历史学院，要求他们派遣代表调查中国民主运动著名领袖李公朴、闻一多二氏惨遭国民党特务暗杀的事件，该电称：李、闻二氏之被刺，证明中国反动派野蛮暴行的加剧。电中列举李、闻二氏在抗日战争时期的功劳，并指出中国文化界许多代表们的生命正处在危险的情况下，因为反动派阴谋坚持他们的独裁统治。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】天津讯：此间大公报刊载其伦敦十九日专电称：昆明于一周内发生李、闻两件政治暗杀案，使此间对中国时局引起更多忧惧。伦敦泰晤士报在评论中提到此二人，认为他们是崇尚民主的自由主义者，并且耽心这种暗杀事件“将成为中国可悲的兵争中的另一凶恶因素”。该报说：“国民党中不免有痛恨共产党比恨日本更深一层的分子”，并指出“民主同盟因不断的主张建立民主的联合政府，所以激起了这个团体的愤怒”。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】南京讯：中共和民主同盟代表将李、闻惨案真象揭露后，国民党当局力图加以掩饰。十八日起中央社连发电讯为恶名昭彰的中统特务头子陈立夫辩护，声言周恩来的据实揭露，“应负政治上与法律上之责任”，企图转移视线，推卸责任，以便继续推行其在全国各地暗杀民主领袖之恐怖计划。同时实行新闻封锁，严禁国民党区报纸刊载事实真相，对于中共与民主同盟关于此案的谈话与抗议，中央社一概拒绝转播。但这中间也出了一个岔子，二十一日，民盟负责人在京的谈话，中央社在加以歪曲删改之后，曾予广播，原文如下：“中央社南京二十一日电：民主同盟为李公朴、闻一多遇刺事，于今日下午四时举行记者招待会，首由罗隆基报告此二案经过，直指此为政治暗杀。据称：此案在未查明以前，吾人不能判断，然吾人认为第一显系政治暗杀，第二政府未尽保护之责。罗氏继称：吾人主张迅速调查，民盟方面亦要求参加调查，并派法律专家参加审判，并以此案事实公诸社会，并再度要求取消特务。罗氏并谓：民盟今日已致函政府政协代表转陈蒋主席，说明吾人以上之态度。梁漱溟继之补充谓：政府代表对吾人之要求参加调查与审判，业已表示不拒绝，但吾人希望政府迅速查出此案真相。罗梁二氏继答复记者询问多起，五时散会”。事为某要人所悉，顿时大发雷霆，将中央社负责人大大申斥一顿，该社随即发出通知，将前述电讯全文撤销。
