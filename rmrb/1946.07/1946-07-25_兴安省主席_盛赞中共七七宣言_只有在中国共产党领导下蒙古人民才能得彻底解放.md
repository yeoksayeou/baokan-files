　　Xing'an Province Chairman
    Praises the CCP's July 7th Declaration
    Only Under the Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Can the Mongolian People Achieve Complete Liberation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 16th] Temur Bagan, Chairman of Xing'an Province, recently met with a reporter from this agency and praised the CCP's "July 7th Declaration," calling it "a guide for the Chinese people to strive for independence and democracy." Chairman Temur Bagan recounted that in February of this year, when the Inner Mongolian people sent a delegation to Beiping to petition for autonomy, they were blocked and turned back by the Kuomintang authorities. He said: "Our five million Inner Mongolian people realize that to achieve freedom and liberation, we must oppose the Kuomintang authorities' dictatorial and civil war behavior and their Han chauvinist policies. We have realized that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the Mongolian people achieve complete liberation. From now on, the Mongolian Self-Defense Army will unite with the Democratic Allied Forces to fight for China's independence, democracy, and peace, and for Inner Mongolian autonomy."
