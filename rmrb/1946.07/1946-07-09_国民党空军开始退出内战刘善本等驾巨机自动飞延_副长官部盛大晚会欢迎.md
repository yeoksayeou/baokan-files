Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. Liu Shanben, captain of the 35th squadron of the 8th Group of the Central Aviation of the Kuomintang, unwilling to participate in the civil war, voluntarily flew a ""-type No. 530 aircraft from Chengdu on the 26th of last month, arriving at Yan'an Airport at 3 p.m. As this giant aircraft suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 2,000 meters over Yan'an Airport, a young soldier in aviation uniform jumped out of the aircraft door first, shouting to the airport guards: "We are here to oppose the civil war!" Subsequently, ten people got off the plane one after another. After our guards inquired about their origins in detail, they immediately led them to the Yan'an Garrison Command and gave them a warm reception. Captain Liu Shanben is from Anqiu, Shandong, and is 30 years old this year. He graduated from the High School Department of Peking University in 1935. Resenting the Japanese invasion, he was admitted to Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School. During the War of Resistance, he served with the Air Force in Chengdu, Lanzhou and other places. In 1943, he was sent to the Douglas Advanced Aviation School in Arizona, USA, and the "Albuquerque" basic flight training school in New Mexico. He returned to China in 1945 and served in the 35th Squadron of the 8th Aviation Group. Recently, he was ordered to fly from Shanghai to Chengdu and Kunming to transport military supplies and equipment to supply the civil war. Starting from a pure patriotic standpoint, Liu felt that the self-destructive civil war was not the original intention of a good man, and decided to fly to Yan'an and resolutely break away from the civil war vortex. According to Liu, he told reporters: "The motive for flying from Chengdu to Yan'an this time is very simple, that is, I don't want to participate in the civil war." Based on his personal experience, Liu witnessed the corruption and darkness of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said: "Some recent facts have made me particularly angry. Foreign goods are flooding Shanghai, and China's national industries are collapsing one after another. Inland river navigation rights and other sovereign rights have been sold to foreign countries, making China go the way of the Philippines. In order to transport military supplies to the Northeast, 30 million US dollars were spent, while 3 million people in Hunan province were miserably starved to death because the government did not provide relief..." Liu continued: "When I entered aviation school, it was the time when the He-Umezu Agreement was signed. My initial wish was to serve the motherland. The purpose of studying in the United States was also to fight Japan, but I never expected that after the victory of the War of Resistance, I would be forced to carry out a civil war and slaughter my own compatriots, which violated my original intention. Reading Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on June 22 against the US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bill in Chengdu made me more sober. I thought, why should I use American weapons to slaughter my own compatriots? Due to the condemnation of conscience, after repeated thinking, I decided to break away from the sinful career of civil war and maintain a neutral attitude. After arriving in Yan'an, I was fortunate to be treated as a guest in all aspects, and I was assured that the aircraft I flew would not be used in the civil war, which was very gratifying! I hope that all air force personnel can unanimously refuse to transport military supplies and refuse to bomb compatriots, so that the civil war cannot be carried out and peace can be realized."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. In order to welcome the Air Force personnel, including Liu Shanben, who withdrew from the civil war and flew to Yan'an, the Deputy Commander's Office held a cadre evening party at the auditorium of the Central Party School on the 29th of last month. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally attended. Commander-in-Chief Zhu first delivered a brief welcome speech, saying: "Captain Liu Shanben and other ten gentlemen's withdrawal from the civil war marks that all people with a sense of justice in the country oppose the civil war and are unwilling to participate in the civil war; it marks the high tide of the Chinese people's movement to strive for peace, democracy, and independence." The commander-in-chief continued: "We have always adhered to peace, but we are not afraid of the fierce flames ignited by the Kuomintang warlords, and we have the power to extinguish it. (Applause) We warmly welcome the eleven gentlemen to break away from the civil war and work together with the people of the whole country for the cause of peace, democracy, and independence." (The audience applauded warmly) Captain Liu Shanben then stepped onto the stage amidst applause. A young soldier in a gray military uniform, full of energy, appeared in front of the stage. He said: "I feel very ashamed and excited. I am ashamed that I came too late, and I am excited that I can break away from the vortex of the civil war and meet with you Communist friends here." After Captain Liu finished speaking, the audience responded with warm applause. Then, the Ping Opera Troupe performed "Three Attacks on Zhu Village" to add to the fun.

　　国民党空军开始退出内战刘善本等驾巨机自动飞延
    副长官部盛大晚会欢迎
    【新华社延安五日电】国民党中央航空第八大队三十五中队机长刘善本上尉，因不愿内战，自动驾驶“”式五三○号飞机，于上月二十六日自蓉起飞，于午后三时抵达延安机场。当此巨型飞机自两千公尺上空突然急速降落延市机场时，一着航空服青年军人，首先自机门跃出，向机场警卫人员高呼：“我们是反对内战而来的！”旋即有十人，相继下机，经我守卫人员详询来历后，当即引导至延安卫戌司令部，予以热烈招待。刘善本上尉，山东安邱人，现年三十岁。民国二十四年毕业于北平大学高中部，愤恨日本侵略，考入杭州笕桥航空学校，抗战中曾先后随空军至成都、兰州等地服务。民国三十二年被派至美国道格拉斯·阿雷藏那高级航空学校及新墨西哥省“阿尔博克尔克”基本飞行训练学校等处学习。三十四年返国当在航空第八大队三十五中队服务。最近奉命由上海驻地飞赴蓉、昆等地转运军火器材供应内战，刘氏由纯洁的爱国立场出发，深感自相残杀的内战，殊非出于爱好男儿之本愿，决定飞来延安，毅然脱离内战漩涡。据刘氏对记者称：“此次由蓉飞延动机非常简单，即不愿参与内战而已”。刘氏以其亲身体验，目睹国民党统治区的腐败黑暗，他说：“最近一些事实，尤其使我痛愤，外国货在上海充斥，中国民族工业都纷纷倒闭，内河航行权及其他主权，被出卖给外国，使中国走向菲律宾的道路。为了往东北运军火，就花了三万万美元，而湖南一省三百万人，因为政府不加救济，而凄惨饿死……”。刘氏继称：“我进航空学校的时候，正值何梅协定签订，当初的愿望是报效祖国，在美国学习的目的，也是为的打日本，但想不到抗战胜利以后，却被迫来进行内战，屠杀自己同胞，违反我的初愿。在成都读到六月二十二日毛泽东先生关于反对美国军事援蒋法案的声明，使我更清醒了，我想我为什么使用美国武器来屠杀自己的同胞呢？由于良心谴责，再三思维，决心脱离内战的罪恶生涯，保持中立态度；抵延后，幸获得各方面以来宾待遇，并保证不以驾驶之飞机用于内战，甚为快慰！我希望所有空军人员，都能一致地拒运军火、拒炸同胞，使内战无法进行，和平始能实现”。
    【新华社延安五日电】为欢迎退出内战飞延的刘善本上慰等空军人员，副司令长官部于上月廿九日假中央党校礼堂举行干部晚会，毛主席、朱总司令均亲自莅临。首由朱总司令致欢迎词简略谓：“刘善本上尉及其他十位先生的退出内战，标志着全国一切有正义感的人们都反对内战，不愿意参加内战；标志着中国人民争取和平民主独立的运动的高潮”总司令继称：“我们始终坚持和平，但我们并不怕国民党好战分子所燃烧起来的这股凶焰，我们有力量扑灭它。（鼓掌）我们热忱欢迎十一位先生脱离内战，和全国人民一起为和平民主独立事业而共同奋斗。”（全场热烈鼓掌）刘善本上尉随即在掌声中登台讲话，一位身着灰色军装，精神奕奕的青年军人出现在台前，他说：“我感觉十分惭愧和兴奋，惭愧的是来的太晚了，兴奋的是能够脱离内战的漩涡，并在此与诸位中共朋友晤面”。刘上尉词毕，全场复报以热烈掌声。旋即由平剧院演出“三打祝家庄”助兴。
