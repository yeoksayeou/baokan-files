[This Dispatch from Handan] The Yellow River's old course requires a massive river management project. The Ji-Lu-Yu region has been working on re-embankment for over a month, with over 230,000 workers. The Liberated Areas bear a very heavy burden in manpower. However, the Kuomintang authorities have gone back on the Nanjing agreement, delaying the allocation of funds for labor, food, materials, and relocation relief, causing serious obstacles to the river management project. All sectors of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region continue to severely condemn the Kuomintang authorities for this disregard for human life. The *Ji-Lu-Yu Daily* here published statistics on the Yellow River management project in Shouzhang County, which shows the magnitude of the entire project in the eighteen counties of the Ji-Lu-Yu region and the severity of the difficulties encountered. The statistics for the Shouzhang project are as follows: (1) Re-embankment project: The Yellow River embankment within the county is 56,532 meters long on both banks. According to the standard of 28 meters bottom width, 8 meters top width, and 4 meters embankment height, the re-embankment requires a total of 3,100,163.5 cubic meters of new soil, requiring 1,447,454 earthworkers and ramming workers. (2) Straightening the bends: The two sections from Li Cui'e Village to Yang Lu and from Yangji to Zhang Jiyang Village are 1,238 meters long. The new riverbed needs to be widened to 10 meters and deepened to 3.5 meters, requiring a total excavation of 1,317,000 cubic meters of soil. The number of workers needed for excavation and transportation is equal to the number of cubic meters of soil. (3) Repairing dams: A total of 38 grass dams need to be repaired at Zhang Jiyang and Sunkou on the north bank, and Yangji, Wang Zhijun, and Wangzhuang on the south bank. Each dam is based on the standard of 20 meters bottom width, 8 meters top width, 2.3 meters height, and 130 meters length. The 38 dams require a total of 159,068 cubic meters of soil, 85,248 earthworkers, ramming workers, and workers to transport dam materials. In terms of materials, in addition to one-third of the tools that the masses can provide themselves, a subsidy of 50,000,000 yuan in legal tender is required. Repairing 38 dams requires 7,600,000 catties of straw, 114,000 catties of hemp, and 5,700 stakes. A total of 760 ramming frames are required on both banks, costing a total of 80,000,000 yuan.

In total, the river management project in Shouzhang County requires 2,882,613 workers, more than 3,600 tons of flour for labor food, and 370,000,000 yuan for labor funds and materials. The newspaper pointed out: "Out of the 230,000 people in Shouzhang County, only 29,000 are laborers between the ages of 17 and 50. Assuming a maximum labor output of one-third, only 10,000 workers can be deployed each day. The entire project will take 10 months to complete. If we want to complete it ahead of schedule, the Liberated Areas already feel the manpower burden is too heavy. Moreover, the Liberated Areas have persisted in eight years of hard fighting behind enemy lines. How can we pay for the labor and materials needed for the eighteen times larger project than the one in Shouzhang County? Now, the Kuomintang has begun dumping stones at Huayuankou. Their deliberate attempt to sabotage the Nanjing agreement and drown the people in our entire region is obvious. We must rise up to defend and save ourselves."

　　国方违背协议拖延供给
    复堤工程浩繁民力难支
    冀鲁豫日报指出：国民党淹我阴谋昭然若揭，我必奋起自卫自救。
    【本报邯郸讯】黄河故道治河工程浩大，冀鲁豫区复堤开工已达月余，上工人数廿三万余人，解放区在人力方面之负担十分浩繁，而国民党当局竟而背弃南京协议迟不拨发工款、工粮、器材及迁移救济费，致使治河工程遭遇严重阻碍。晋冀鲁豫全边区各界继续严厉谴责国民党当局此种不顾民命之行为。此间冀鲁豫日报发表寿张县之治黄工程统计，即可知冀鲁豫区十八县全部工程之浩大及所遇困难之严重，寿张工程统计如下：（一）复堤工程：该县境内黄堤两岸共长五万六千五百三十二公尺，按底宽二十八公尺，顶宽八公尺，堤高四公尺之标准，复堤，共需新增土三百一十万零一千六百三十五方，需土工硪工一百四十四万七千四百五十四个。（二）裁湾取直：李崔娥庄至杨陆及杨集至张际阳庄两段共长一千二百三十八公尺，新河床须挖宽至十公尺，深三点五公尺，共复挖土一百三十一万七千方，连挖带运所需人工数与方土数相等。（三）修坝：全县北岸张际阳、孙口、南岸杨集，王志君、汪庄等处共须修草坝三十八道，每道坝以底宽二○公尺、顶宽八公尺、高二点三公尺、长一百三十公尺为标准，三十八道共需土一十五万九千零六十八方，土工硪工及搬运坝料工八万五千二百四十八个。在器材方面，工具除群众尽全力可自备三分之一外，尚须补助法币五万万元，修三十八道坝，需秸料七百六十万斤，麻一十一万四千斤，桩五千七百根，两岸共需硪七百六十架，共需八万万元。
    总计寿张县境之治河工程即需人工二百八十八万二千六百一十三个，工粮面粉三千六百余吨，工款器材等三十七万万元。该报指出：“寿张全县二十三万人口中，十七至五十岁的民夫仅二万九千人，以出工最高量三分之一计算，每天仅能出工一万人，全部工程须十个月始能完成，欲提前完工，解放区人力负担已感太重，且解放区坚持敌后八年苦战，如何支付十八倍于寿张全县修堤所需之工料费用？现在花园口国民党开始抛石，其蓄意破坏南京协议淹死我全区人民，已昭然若揭。我们必须奋起自卫自救。”
