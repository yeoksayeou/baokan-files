    Jiefang (Liberation) Press, Xinhua Bookstore
    Important Announcement
    Recently, many outside parties have been freely reprinting books published by our press and bookstore. Upon closer inspection, many errors and omissions are found. For example, the "Current Situation and Our Tasks" reprinted by outside parties contains many erroneous arguments and even uses the term "Standard Edition," making it difficult for readers to distinguish. Furthermore, there are numerous instances where outside parties continue to reprint and sell old editions of books that our press and bookstore have decided not to reprint or are about to reissue in revised editions. These situations are numerous and varied. Publishing work is an extremely serious undertaking that is responsible to the people. In the future, if anyone intends to reprint books from our press and bookstore, please first contact the Publishing Committee (No. 75 Sifabu Street, Beiping) to obtain consent before reprinting. Otherwise, we will investigate and prosecute in accordance with the law. This announcement is hereby made.

    解放社  新华书店
    重要启事
    本社本店出版之书籍，近来外界不少自由翻印者，稍加检查，即知弊漏甚多，如外界翻印之“目前形势和我们的任务”一书，就很多错论还用了“标准本”字样，使读者难以鉴别。又如本社本店已决定不再重版或曾经修订即将新排之书籍，外界仍照旧本翻印发售者，亦属不少，种种情况，不一而足。出版工作系对人民负责的极其严肃的工作。以后如有拟翻印本社本店之书籍者，务请先到出版委员会（北平司法部街七十五号）接洽，取得同意，然后翻印。否则，当依法进行查究，此启。
