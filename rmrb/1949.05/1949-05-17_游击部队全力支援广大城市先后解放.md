Since the Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign, with the strong cooperation of the people's guerrilla forces in Jiangnan and the support of the broad masses of the people, the People's Liberation Army has successively liberated Nanjing, the reactionary ruling center of the Kuomintang, and 102 cities in Jiangsu Province including Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Songjiang, Wujiang, Yangzhou, Jiangyin, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, Jiangning, Jurong, Jintan, Piaoshui, Yixing, Gaochun, Liyang, Jiangpu; Anhui Province including Anqing, Dangtu, Wuhu, Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Guichi, Dongliu, Zhide, Nanling, Xuan City, Guangde, Jingxian, Langxi, Ningguo, Jingde, Taiping, Jixi, She County, Xiuning, Yi County, Qimen, Shidai, Wuyuan; Zhejiang Province including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Changxing, Wuxing, Anji, Xiaofeng, Wukang, Deqing, Yuhang, Tongxiang, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, Tangxi, Longyou, Qu County, Jiangshan, Chun'an, Sui'an, Jiande, Shouchang, Kaihua, Changshan, Dongyang, Yongkang, Wuyi, Jinyun, Suichang, Xuanping, Songyang, Lishui; Jiangxi Province including Pengze, Fuliang, Leping, Poyang, Wannian, Yugan, Yushan, Dexing, Shangrao, Guangfeng, Qianshan, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Guixi, Shunjiang, Dongxiang, Jinxi, Linchuan, Nancheng; and Fujian Province including Pucheng, Chong'an, and Jianyang. Among them are two provincial capitals, namely Zhenjiang and Hangzhou. These are the wealthiest areas in China, with developed industries, abundant agricultural products, and relatively widespread education. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary clique mainly relied on sucking the blood of the people in these areas to cultivate its counter-revolutionary forces. Therefore, the liberation of the above-mentioned areas is a heavy blow to the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang. The enemy annihilated by the People's Liberation Army included the entire 4th, 20th, 28th, 45th, 51st, 68th, and 106th armies of the enemy's regular army, most of the 96th Army, two complete divisions of the 88th Army, the entire 174th Division of the 46th Army, and all units under the 9th Training Area Headquarters, as well as parts of the 18th, 21st, 54th, 73rd, and 99th armies. A total of more than 190,000 enemy troops were killed, wounded, or captured. Among them, more than 20 high-ranking enemy officers were captured, including Zhang Yichun, pseudo-chairman and security commander of Anhui Province, Luo Xianda, commander of the 66th Army, Li Xiaoliang, deputy commander of the 4th Army, and Chen Qinmin, deputy commander of the 20th Army. The People's Liberation Army seized a large amount of military supplies. In the area south of Quzhou alone, more than 500 vehicles, more than 50,000 artillery shells, and 18 million rounds of ammunition were seized.

In the People's Liberation Army's mighty southern expedition, the Jiangnan People's Guerrilla forces, who had long persisted in fighting behind enemy lines, actively cooperated with the Liberation Army in combat. They coordinated with the Liberation Army to encircle and annihilate small groups of enemy troops, seize weapons from scattered bandits, and maintain order in the liberated cities, enabling the Liberation Army to concentrate its forces on pursuing and annihilating the fleeing bandit troops.

　　游击部队全力支援广大城市先后解放
    自渡江作战以来，人民解放军在江南人民游击队的有力配合和广大人民的支援下，已陆续解放国民党反动统治中心南京，与江苏省的镇江、丹阳、常州、无锡、苏州、昆山、松江、吴江、扬中、江阴、常熟、太仓、嘉定、江宁、句容、金坛、漂水、宜兴、高＠、溧阳、江浦，安徽省的安庆、当涂、芜湖、繁昌、铜陵、青阳、贵池、东流、至德、南陵、宣城、广德、泾县、郎溪、宁国、旌德、太平、绩溪、歙县、休宁、黟县、祁门、石埭、婺源，浙江省的杭州、嘉兴、平湖、长兴、吴兴、安吉、孝丰、武康、德清、余杭、桐乡、萧山、绍兴、诸暨、义乌、金华、汤溪、龙游、衢县、江山、淳安、遂安、建德、寿昌、开化、常山、东阳、永康、武义、缙云、遂昌、宣平、松阳、丽水，江西省的彭泽、浮梁、乐平、鄱阳、万年、余干、玉山、德兴、上饶、广丰、铅山、横峰、弋阳、贵溪、顺江、东乡、金溪、临川、南城，福建省之浦城、崇安、建阳等一百零二座城市。其中有省会二座，即镇江、杭州。这些都是中国最富庶的地方，工业发达，农产丰富，教育比较普及，过去国民党反动集团主要地就是依靠吮吸这些地方人民的膏血，来培植其反革命势力。因此，上述地区的解放，对于国民党匪帮残余势力是个沉重打击。人民解放军歼灭的敌人，有敌正规军第四军、二十军、二十八军、四十五军、五十一军、六十八军、一零六军等八个军全部，九十六军大部，八十八军之两个整师，四十六军之一七四师全部，第九编练区司令部所属全部，十八军、二十一军、五十四军、七十三军、九十九军各一部。共计毙伤俘敌十九万余人。其中俘掳的敌高级军官有安徽省伪主席兼保安司令张义纯、六十六军军长罗贤达、第四军副军长李孝亮、二十军副军长陈亲民等二十余名。解放军缴获军火辎重极多，仅在衢州以南一处即缴获汽车五百余辆，各种炮弹五万余发，子弹一千八百万发。
    在人民解放军浩荡南征中，长期坚持敌后斗争的江南人民游击队，积极配合解放军作战。他们协同解放军围歼小股敌军，收缴散匪武器，维持已解放城市的秩序，使解放军得以集中力量追歼溃逃的匪军。
