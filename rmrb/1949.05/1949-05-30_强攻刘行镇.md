　　Fierce Attack on Liuhang Town

    Liuhang Town was a strongly fortified stronghold of the Kuomintang bandit army in the northwest of Shanghai. It was only fifteen li away from Wusong Town, the throat of the Huangpu River, and several highways converged here. In addition to utilizing fortifications left by the Japanese invaders, the enemy garrison of one battalion had spent more than five months reinforcing many steel-reinforced concrete fortifications. The town was surrounded by three natural moats, and the city streets were surrounded by three rows of barbed wire, three rows of chevaux de frise, an electric fence, and a trench. The open ground extending 500 meters in depth and the areas above and below the moats were filled with bamboo spikes, caltrops, iron nets, landmines, pits, and nearly a hundred steel-reinforced concrete bunkers. On the roads leading to the town, there was a pillbox every fifty meters. Fortresses were interdependent, forming five corners, constituting a so-called "permanent national defense工事". The bandit leaders of the Kuomintang bandit army's 52nd Corps also issued a fascist terrorist order of "full-scale supervision of military discipline" to the battalion, forcing officers and soldiers to fight to the death.

    However, whether it was a "permanent national defense工事" or "full-scale supervision of military discipline", the People's Liberation Army crushed it in six hours.

    At 11:00 p.m. on the 14th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army launched a coordinated infantry and artillery attack on Liuhang Town. Li Guorong, the squad leader of the "Tai'an Company" assault squad of the main attack force, holding explosives, twice broke into the enemy's fire net from the southwest corner of the town to scout the path of attack. After discovering that the obstacles on the enemy's position were so dense that it was impossible to gain a foothold, he bravely led the assault team into the first outer river, which was twenty meters wide. The soldiers used their shoulders to form human ladders, climbed onto the three embankments covered with iron caltrops, and then used their hands, feet, shovels, and gun butts to clear obstacles, open up the path of attack, and pass through the landmine nets and bamboo spikes. Their clothes, shoes, and socks were torn, and their hands and feet were bleeding, but they still advanced quickly and decisively through the 500-meter deep obstacles, climbed the walls, and immediately engaged in a fierce battle.

    The brave attackers displayed their best skills, using bayonets to fight the enemy repeatedly. Gao Dianying, the deputy platoon leader of the "Tai'an Company", stepped on a landmine during the battle. He immediately jumped away and lay down. The landmine detonated, deafening his ears. An enemy jumped up and grabbed him, and the two rolled on the ground, tearing and fighting. Soldier Zhao Fengxi rushed up and kicked the enemy over. Zhu Boyu, the second squad leader of the eighth company of the unit, under the cover of night, pursued a company of enemies alone in the dark trench, advancing two hundred meters, vying for each bunker. Just as Deputy Company Commander Gao Chuanlao and soldiers Jiao Baoying, Wang Dawu, and others also advanced diagonally, the four of them annihilated this group of enemies inside three steel-reinforced concrete bunkers. The attacking troops of the People's Liberation Army, with this kind of brave fighting, controlled the town's walls and high ground, and eliminated the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit army entrenched in the center of the city. At 5:00 a.m. on the 15th, the People's Liberation Army completely occupied Liuhang Town.

　　强攻刘行镇
    刘行镇是国民党匪军在上海市西北的强固据点，东距黄浦江咽喉吴淞镇仅十五里，好几条公路都以此为联结点。镇上守敌一个营除了利用日寇遗留下的工事而外，并以五个多月时间增修了许多钢骨水泥工事。镇的外围有三道天然河沟，市街周围有三道铁丝网、三道鹿砦、一道电网和一道壕沟，纵深五百米达的开阔地上和河沟上下，布满了竹签梅花桩，铁叉地罗网、地雷、陷坑和近百个钢骨水泥地堡。在通往该镇的公路上，每隔五十米达即有一座碉堡。堡垒相依，五为犄角，构成一座所谓“永久性国防工事”。守敌国民党匪军五十二军的匪首们，又向该营发布了“全面督战军纪”的法西斯恐怖命令，强迫官兵卖命。
    但是，无论“永久性国防工事”也好，“全面督战军纪”也好，人民解放军六个钟头就把它粉碎了。
    十四日夜十一时，解放军某部对刘行镇开始了步炮协同的强攻。主攻部队的“泰安连”突击班班长李国荣，抱着炸药，两次从镇西南角插进敌人火网中去侦察冲锋道路。他发觉敌人阵地上的障碍物密得无法插脚以后，便勇敢地带领突击队进入第一道二十米达宽的外河。战士们用肩头架成人梯，登上了布有铁叉地罗网的三道河堤，随即用手、脚、铁锹和枪托排除障碍物，开辟冲锋道路，通过了地雷网和竹签桩。他们衣服鞋袜都被挂破了，手脚流着鲜血，但他们仍然迅速果敢的冒着敌人火力前进，以三十五分钟通过了五百米达的纵深障碍物，登上围墙，随即投入了恶战。
    强攻的勇士们，施展了最拿手的本领，用刺刀和敌人反复拼夺。“泰安连”的副排长高殿英，在战斗中踏上了一个地雷，他马上猛力跳开、卧倒。地雷炸得他耳朵都震聋了，一个敌人跳上来抓住他，两人便在地上滚来滚去，撕打成一团。战士赵凤喜赶上来，一脚便将敌人踢翻。该部八连二班长朱伯玉，在夜色掩护下，单身在暗壕里追击着一个连的敌人，逐堡争夺着前进了二百米达，刚好副连长高传劳和战士焦宝莹、王大武等三人也斜插过来了，他们四个人便将这股敌人歼灭在三座钢骨水泥地堡里面。解放军的攻击部队，就是以这种勇猛的战斗，控制了全镇的围墙和制高点，并解决了据守市街中心的国民党匪军残部。十五日上午五时人民解放军就全部占领刘行镇。
