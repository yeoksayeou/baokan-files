Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 26th: According to TASS, Paris: On May 24th, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference began discussing the first item on the agenda: "The unification of Germany, including economic principles, political principles, and Allied control." British Foreign Secretary Bevin served as the chairman of the meeting.

Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke first during the discussion. Vyshinsky first elaborated on the importance of the economic and political unification of Germany and reviewed the important decisions of the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences and the 1947 Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference on this issue. Subsequently, Vyshinsky discussed the activities of the German Control Council, the issue of German reparations, and the Ruhr issue. He reiterated the Soviet government's stance on these issues. After listing the facts, Vyshinsky criticized the divisive measures taken by the US, British, and French governments in Germany. In order to ensure the economic and political unification of Germany, Vyshinsky presented the following specific recommendations to the conference: (1) Restore the activities of the German Control Council and restore the Allied Joint Command in Berlin. (2) Establish an all-German State Council based on the existing economic committees in the eastern and western occupation zones; restore the Berlin City Council.

After Vyshinsky's speech, the US, French, and British foreign ministers spoke successively. US Secretary of State Acheson said that when he listened to Vyshinsky's speech, he had the hope that the Foreign Ministers' Conference might reach an agreement on the issue of German unification. However, Acheson's further remarks opposed the Soviet proposals and made it clear that the US delegation continued to adhere to its previous position and did not intend to eliminate the divisive activities it was carrying out in West Germany. Acheson tried to prove that the so-called de-Nazification and eradication of militarism in West Germany had been completed, that war criminals there had been tried and punished, and that all democratic freedoms had been fully realized there. Therefore, the tasks facing the Allied control in the early stages were said to have been resolved in the Western occupation zones. Acheson argued that the Western countries were not responsible for the division of Germany. He said that Germany was automatically divided into separate parts, like an organ composed of separate cells. Regarding the Soviet delegation's proposals, Acheson said that the proposals "disappointed" him. He opposed the proposal to restore the activities of the Control Council on the previous basis, insisting that this step would cause "a patient who is recovering to fall back into complete paralysis." When Acheson spoke about the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German State Council, he said that doing so would be a step backward rather than a step forward.

French Foreign Minister Schuman and British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speeches on the issue of German unification agreed with Acheson's opinions in some respects, while in other respects they were vague.

　　外长会议第二次会
  　维辛斯基重申苏联态度
    坚决主张建立统一德国
    【新华社北平二十六日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：五月廿四日，四国外长会议开始讨论第一项议程：“德国的统一包括经济原则政治原则和盟国管制”问题。英外相贝文担任会议的主席。
    苏外长维辛斯基在讨论时首先发言。维辛斯基首先阐述德国经济、政治统一问题的重要性，并回溯雅尔塔、波茨坦会议和一九四七年莫斯科外长会议关于这一问题的重要决定。其后，维辛斯基论及德国管制委员会的活动、德国赔偿问题和鲁尔问题，他重申苏联政府在这些问题上的态度。在列举事实之后，维辛斯基批评了美英法政府在德国所采取的分裂措施。为了保证德国经济与政治的统一起见，维辛斯基向会议提出下列具体建议：（一）恢复德国管委会的活动，恢复柏林各盟国联合司令部。（二）以东、西占领区现存的经济委员会为基础，建立全德国的国务会议；恢复柏林市议会。
    维辛斯基发言之后，美、法、英外长相继发言。美国务卿艾奇逊说，当他倾听维辛斯基的演说时，他发生了这种希望：外长会议或者会在德国统一问题上获致协议。但是，艾奇逊进一步的发言，却反对苏联所提的建议，并使人清楚地了解：美国代表团继续坚持以前的立场，不打算消除它在西德所进行的分裂活动。艾奇逊力图证明：西德的所谓肃清纳粹和铲除军国主义业已完成，该地的战犯业已受到审判与惩处，一切民主自由业已在该地完全实现，因此，在管制初期摆在盟国管制面前的任务，据说业已在西占区解决了。艾奇逊辩称，西方国家对德国的分裂不负任何责任。他说，德国是自动分裂成单独部分的，有如由单独的细胞组成的器官一样。谈到苏联代表团的建议时，艾奇逊说：建议使他“失望”。他反对在以前的基础上恢复管制委员会活动的建议，他硬说这种步骤将使“正在康复的病人再度陷入完全麻痹状态”。艾奇逊谈及苏联关于成立全德国务会议的建议时说，如果这样做，将是后退一步，而不是前进一步。
    法外长舒曼和英外相贝文关于德国统一问题的发言，某些方面同意艾奇逊的意见，某些方面则含糊其词。
