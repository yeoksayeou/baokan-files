[Chahar News] In the fruit tree areas of Huailai, Yihua, and Huairou counties in the Nankou sub-district, pests such as *mei @@* (local name for cutworm, hairy caterpillar, often found on apple and pear trees, and general fruit trees) and pear star *@@* (local names include bagworm, leaf roller, often found on pear trees) have emerged, eating the tender leaves of apple, pear, peach, and apricot trees, causing severe damage. For example, in Canfangying Village (over 400 households) in Huailai County, more than half of the 30-plus hectares of orchards have been affected, with pests eating all the buds and leaves, causing flowers and fruits to wither and preventing fruit production, according to investigations. At the beginning of this month, the provincial government organized forces, and hired technicians from the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, carrying equipment and chemicals, to go to the infested areas to assist the masses in exterminating the pests and saving the fruit trees.

According to a report from the technical extension team sent to Huailai, the team, in coordination with local administrative cadres, carried out in-depth publicity and mobilization, as well as demonstrations of spraying with equipment and chemicals, which has achieved great results. In Heishankou Village, with over a hundred households and more than four hectares of orchards, all *mei @@* caterpillars have been wiped out, leaving only some of the star *@@* caterpillars, which the masses are currently catching (according to the star *@@* caterpillars, before they leave their webbed nests, are easy to pick off by hand, burn with fire, bury deep, or crush to death). In addition to the masses' efforts, the technical extension team used six sprayers in three villages over four days, spraying a total of 3,975 major fruit trees (apple, pear, Betel nut, etc.). It is estimated that more than 1.59 million *mei @@* caterpillars were killed, and more than 2.38 million star *@@* caterpillars were blocked by the poison in their webbed nests. During their work, the extension team also conducted technical publicity on fruit tree management and other techniques. Currently, the masses are continuing to expand the results of the pest capture.

　　怀来等地扑杀害虫
  　四千棵果树得救
    【察哈尔讯】南口分区怀来、乙化、怀柔等县果树区，发生梅＠＠（土名黏虫，梅毛虫，多发生于苹果树、梨树、一般果树）及梨星＠＠（土名包儿虫、卷叶虫、多发生于梨树）等害虫，咀食苹果、梨、桃、杏树嫩叶，为害甚烈。如怀来县蚕房营村（四百余户）果田三十余顷，被害虫将芽叶吃光、花果干谢、不能结果的据调查即在二分之一以上。省府于本月初组织力量，并聘请华北农业科学研究所技术人员，携带器械药品，分赴虫区协助群众扑灭害虫，抢救果树。
    兹据赴怀来技术推广组报告，该组配合当地行政干部，深入宣传动员及器械药剂的示范喷杀，已收很大效果。黑山口村百余户，有果田四顷多，梅＠＠虫全部歼灭，只剩下部分的星＠＠虫，群众正捕捉中的（按星＠＠虫在未出网包以前，便于用手摘捉，用火烧深埋或砸死它）除群众扑打的以外，技术推广组在三个村四天时间内使用六架喷雾器，共计喷射主要果树（苹果、梨、槟等）三千九百七十五株。约消灭梅＠＠虫一百五十九万余条，并使二百三十八万多条星＠＠虫被毒药封锁在网包中。推广组在工作中并进行果树管理等技术宣传，现群众对捕捉害虫正继续扩展战果。（察哈尔省政府农业处郭毅民）
