    Economic Planning in New Democratic Countries
    By Goman
    Translated by Tuofu

    A significant result of World War I was that more than one-sixth of the earth broke through the imperialist front; one of the most important results of World War II was the further weakening of the imperialist system as many countries in Central and Eastern Europe broke away from the imperialist system. In these countries, state power has undergone fundamental changes, land reforms have been implemented, and the major means of production have been nationalized. They are now creating a planned economy.

    In planning their economies, the New Democratic countries are learning from the rich experience of Soviet socialist planning (whose basic principles were formulated by Lenin and Stalin).

    Relying on the state power of the working people led by the working class, on state-owned industry, banks, large-scale domestic and foreign trade, and on the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the New Democratic countries are engaged in successful socialist planning. This has emerged from their experience in struggling to restore their post-war economies. Although there were some important shortcomings in the early stages, they have achieved remarkable results, especially in strengthening and expanding socialization, ensuring increased production, and improving living standards.

    Today, the New Democratic countries are dealing with a more complex task—industrialization, reorganizing and building the economy on a socialist basis. However, socialism will not come automatically. Only by promoting socialist economic forms can this task be achieved, most importantly by developing socialized heavy industry and by restricting and eliminating capitalist forms of production. A prerequisite for this is to find ways to guide small-scale production onto the socialist track.

    The current economic plans of the New Democracies have the following main objectives: to restore the economy damaged by the war, to ensure a rapid rise in living standards, to strengthen the new social order on this basis, and to prepare the preconditions for further development. However, these economic recovery plans are short-term, with goals that can be achieved within two or three years.

    When these plans are completed (1948-1949), the national income of each country will be: Czechoslovakia 100% of pre-war; Poland 116%; Hungary 114%. Bulgaria will also increase considerably, but it must be noted that its pre-war level was very low.

    In all these countries, plans are not made mechanically; each country calculates according to the structure of its pre-war national economy. The first priority is to expand industrial production, especially the production of means of production. This prepares the basis for the further economic development of these countries and enables the development of their industries to strengthen socialized economic factors.

    Judging by today's achievements, it is clear that the goals of all these countries will be achieved, and in some cases exceeded.

    Living standards are rising in parallel with production development. The real wages in each New Democratic country are significantly higher than before the war: Bulgaria's wages are 10% higher than before the war, Czechoslovakia's are 40% higher, while Hungary and Poland's increases fall between these two figures. Land reform in the New Democratic countries distributed approximately 10 million hectares of land to formerly landless and land-poor peasants, greatly improving their economic position. These economic plans will further improve the living conditions of all urban and rural working people.

    The changes that have taken place in the economic structure of certain New Democratic countries can be clearly demonstrated by the following figures: Czechoslovakia's industrial production in 1948 exceeded pre-war levels by 10%; Poland by 51%; Hungary by 27%. Czechoslovakia's agricultural production last year (1948) reached pre-war levels; Poland's was 80% of pre-war, and Hungary's was 90%.

    By the end of 1949, Bulgaria's industrial production will increase by 67% compared to 1939, and agricultural production will increase by 34%.

    Agriculture in Poland and Hungary suffered serious losses during the war, and recovery will take more time. On the other hand, due to the rapid development of industrial production, the national income of both countries has exceeded pre-war levels.

    The economic plan of the People's Republic of Romania is slightly different; it only began its one-year plan this year. Until 1948, Romania only had decisive industrial nationalization, that is to say, later than other countries, and it had to limit itself to short-term industrial plans of three to six months.

    The planned development of the basic industries of the three relatively developed New Democratic countries, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary, presents an interesting picture, as can be seen from the following figures:

    Czechoslovakia's coal production will increase from 28.2 million tons in 1937-38 to 32.3 million tons at the end of the economic plan; Poland's coal production will increase from 38.1 million tons to 80 million tons; Hungary's will increase from 9.3 million tons to 11.6 million tons. Czechoslovakia's steel production will increase from 2.3 million tons in 1937-38 to 2.4 million tons in the final year of the plan; Poland's will increase from 1.4 million tons to 2 million tons; Hungary's will increase from 600,000 tons to 800,000 tons. Czechoslovakia's electricity production will increase from 4.1 million kilowatt-hours to 7.4 million kilowatt-hours; Poland's will increase from 3.9 million kilowatt-hours to 8 million kilowatt-hours; Hungary's will increase from 1.4 million kilowatt-hours to 2 million kilowatt-hours.

    The above figures show that these three countries have considerable economic potential, close to that of France. These figures show that the possibility of these countries moving towards socialist economic development is far greater than those countries whose economies are under the pressure of the general crisis of capitalism and are subject to the harmful effects of the "Marshall Plan."

    The rapid development of the planned economies of these New Democratic countries is not only due to internal factors. Without the political and economic assistance of their great ally—the socialist Soviet Union, without the Soviet Union's military assistance during the anti-fascist liberation war, planned economies in these New Democratic countries would not be possible. The Soviet Union has signed long-term economic agreements with every New Democratic country, on the basis of which the Soviet Union supplies the New Democratic countries with raw materials, some food, and especially important means of production. These supplies are often linked to large-scale credit.

    Apart from the Soviet Union, almost all New Democratic countries have signed mutual economic agreements. This raises the issue of planned cooperation between countries with planned economies. The interests of these countries in further developing their national and general economic potential, and in strengthening their independence from imperialist countries, are intertwined. These common interests require closer economic cooperation, not just trade relations.

    The close, planned economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, and the new forms of mutual assistance, are first reflected in the long-term agreements already signed between them. Corresponding to the economic agreements signed between the New Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, considerable credit loans have been granted to the New Democratic countries, and in some cases, their prices are pre-determined.

    The possibility of planned cooperation between these countries and the need to strengthen this cooperation are due, on the one hand, to the fact that they are planned economies, and on the other hand, because the economic structures of each New Democratic country and the Soviet Union are different, and to a certain extent, one country complements the other.

    Only a planned economy that can show a complete and detailed picture of the various problems and difficulties in economic development can help to quickly discover the obstacles that are likely to occur in this or that country, and eliminate these obstacles within the scope of cooperation with other countries. Plans that only consider the unsolvable problems encountered by a specific country do not consider the problems faced by other New Democratic countries.

    The principle of cooperation and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries is the equality of these countries and the protection of their interests. This is in stark contrast to the "Marshall Plan," which attempts to place other countries under the rule of American imperialism.

    Completing the planned cooperation between the New Democratic countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and among themselves is one of the main guarantees of the success of these countries' plans.

    Economic cooperation and mutual assistance like this is unimaginable among capitalist countries. This can be fully demonstrated by the "Marshall Plan," which is a tool for the United States to export surplus goods and capital, a tool for the United States to seize resources and raw materials, and a tool for imperialist leaders to enslave European countries and realize plunderous ambitions. The apparent purpose of the "Marshall Plan" is modest—to restore the production of some European countries to pre-war levels, even if it is impossible to reach pre-war levels of consumption by 1951. But this goal cannot be achieved because American imperialism attempts to limit and close down the industries of those European countries that compete with American industry in the world market through the "Marshall Plan." How harshly American imperialism attempts to prevent the recovery of industries in European countries that can compete with it can be seen from the fact that only 8% of the machinery and other industrial equipment under the "Marshall Plan" are supplied.

    In fact, countries accepting the Marshall Plan are increasingly becoming vassals of the United States, and their industries are becoming more and more backward compared to the New Democratic countries, although they suffered far less damage during the war than the New Democratic countries. How big is the difference in the rate of industrial development between the two groups of countries can be seen from the following materials: In the autumn of 1948, the industrial production of Marshallized France reached 97% of the 1937 level; Belgium—85%; the Netherlands—103%; Italy—83%; the combined occupied zones of Germany—46%. The picture is completely different in the New Democratic countries. In the autumn of 1948, Czechoslovakia's industrial production reached 110% of pre-war levels; Poland—151%; Hungary—127%; Bulgaria—158%.

    The subordination of the economic interests of Marshallized countries to the needs of the United States is first reflected in living standards. Consumption per capita in these countries in 1951 will still be lower than before the war; meat consumption will be 15% lower, fat 10% lower, bread 7% lower, sugar 8% lower, and general consumption per capita will be 10% lower. The actual results are likely to be even lower than projected by the "Marshall Plan".

    Against this backdrop, the striking contrast is the mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the New Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, which never intends for its own benefit. Without Soviet assistance, the planning and development of the national economies of these countries would not be possible.

    On the basis of successfully completing short-term plans, the New Democratic countries are reaching the stage of economic recovery, and their economies have suffered significant losses during the war and enemy occupation. Many industries have considerably exceeded pre-war targets. They are drafting long-term plans. These plans will be powerful weapons for the further economic and political development of the New Democratic countries towards socialism. The implementation of these plans will guarantee the rapid development of socialist economic factors, guarantee the gradual restriction and eventual elimination of residual capitalist elements, and prepare the preconditions for turning small-scale production onto the socialist track.

    新民主主义国家的经济计划
    Ｇｏｍａｎ作
    托夫译
    第一次世界大战时的显著结果，是六分之一以上的地球突破帝国主义战线；第二次世界大战的最重要结果之一，则是由于中东欧许多国家脱出了帝国主义制度，更进一步地削弱帝国主义制度。在这些国家中，国家权力已发生根本变化，实行了土地改革，和国有化了主要的生产手段，它们现在正在创造着一种计划经济。
    在计划它们经济中，新民主主义国家正从苏联社会主义计划（其基本原则是列宁斯大林所制定的）的丰富经验学习。
    新民主主义国家依靠工人阶级所领导的劳动人民的国家权力，依靠国有工业、银行、大规模的国内外贸易以及苏联兄弟之谊的帮助，正在从事于成功的社会主义计划。这是从它们为恢复战后经济而斗争的经验中产生出来的。虽然在初期存在着不少重要的缺点，但它们已经获得显著的成绩，特别是在加强和扩大社会主义化、保证增加产量、和增进生活标准等方面。
    今天，新民主主义国家正在处理着一种更复杂工作—工业化，在社会主义基础上改组和建设经济。可是，社会主义不会自动到来。只有促进社会主义的经济形式才能实现这个任务，最主要的是发展社会主义化的重工业，以及限制和消灭资本主义的生产形式。而其先决条件则是设法引导小规模的生产跑上社会主义的轨道。
    当前新民主主义经济计划具有下面主要的目标：恢复为战争所破坏的经济，保证生活标准的迅速提高，在这个基础上加强新社会秩序，并为准备更进一步发展的先决条件。然而这些恢复经济的计划都是短期的，其目标能在二、三年之内实现。
    当这些计划完成时（一九四八——一九四九），各国的国民收入将是：捷克是战前百分之百；波兰是百分之一百一十六；匈牙利是百分之一百一十四。保加利亚也要相当地增加，但这里必须注意及它战前的水平是很低的。
    在所有这些国家中，计划并非机械地制成的，每个国家都按其战前国民经济的结构来计算。首先要扩大工业产品，特别是生产手段的产品。这就为这些国家经济更进一步发展准备基础，并使它们工业的发展能够加强社会主义化的经济因素。
    按照今天的成绩来判断，很明显地所有这些国家的目标都将达到，并要超过若干。
    生活标准是和生产发展并行地上长着，每个新民主主义国家的实际工资都大大地较战前为高：保加利亚的工资较战前高出百分之十，捷克则高出百分之四十，而匈牙利和波兰的增加则介乎这两个数字之间。新民主主义国家的土地改革，分给约一千万公顷土地予以前无地和少地的农民，这样大大地改进他们的经济地位。这些经济计划为一切城乡劳动人民更进一步改进其生活条件。
    某些新民主主义国家经济结构所发生的变化，可从下面的数目得到明显的证明：捷克一九四八年的工业生产超过战前百分之十；波兰起过百分之五十一；匈牙利是超过百分之二十七。捷克去年（一九四八年）农业生产已达到战前水平；而波兰则为战前百分之八十，匈牙利为百分之九十。
    到一九四九年年底，保加利亚工业生产较之一九三九年将增加百分之六十七，农业生产将增加百分之三十四。
    波兰及匈牙利的农业，在战时曾遭受着严重的损失，要恢复则须更多的时间。另一方面，由于工业生产的迅速发展，这两个国家的国民收入都超过战前的水平。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的经济计划稍为不同，今年才开始它的一年计划。直至一九四八年，罗马尼亚才有决定性的工业国有化，就是说，较其他国家为晚，它乃不得不局限于三个月至六个月的短期工业计划。
    捷克、波兰和匈牙利三个工业比较发展的新民主主义国家的基本工业之有计划的发展，呈现着一个有趣味的图景，此可从下面的数字表明之：
    捷克煤的生产，将从一九三七—三八年的二千八百二十万吨，增加到经济计划结束时的三千二百三十万吨；波兰煤的生产将从三千八百一十万吨提高到八千万吨；匈牙利则从九百三十万吨增加到一千一百六十万吨。捷克钢的生产将从一九三七—三八年的二百三十万吨，增加到计划最后一年中的二百四十万吨；波兰从一百四十万吨增加到二百万吨；匈牙利从六十万吨增加到八十万吨。捷克电力的生产将从四百一十万基罗瓦小时增加到七百四十万基罗瓦小时；波兰从三百九十万基罗瓦小时增加到八百万基罗瓦小时；匈牙利从一百四十万基罗瓦小时增加到二百万基罗瓦小时。
    上面数字表明了这三个国家具有相当的经济潜力，接近于法国的经济潜力。这些数字显示着这些国家走向社会主义的经济发展的可能性，远较那些经济处在资本主义总危机压力之下的，和受“马歇尔计划”有害影响之下的国家为大。
    这些新民主主义国家计划经济之迅速发展，不仅是由于内部的因素。设若没有它们伟大的盟邦——社会主义苏联的政治和经济的援助，设若在反法西斯解放战争期间没有苏联的军事援助，这些新民主主义国家中的计划经济是不可能的。苏联已与每一个新民主主义国家签订了长期的经济协定，在这些协定基础上，苏联供给新民主主义国家以原料、部分食物，尤其是重要的生产手段。这些供给经常是和大规模信贷连结着的。
    除开与苏联国家外，几乎所有新民主主义国家之间都签订了互相的经济协定。此乃提出了计划经济国家之间有计划的合作的问题。这些国家进一步发展它们国家的和整个一般经济潜力，以及加强其摆脱帝国主义国家的独立，其利益是互相结合着的，这些共同利益要求着更加密切的经济合作，而不仅是贸易关系。
    苏联与新民主主义国家之间的密切的有计划的经济合作，以及它们的相互援助的新形式，首先反映于它们之间所已订立的长期协定中。适应着新民主主义国家和苏联之间所已签订的经济协定，相当的信用贷款已给予新民主主义国家，在某些场合其价格是预先规定。
    这些国家间的有计划合作的可能以及需要加强这种合作，一方面因为是它们是计划经济，另方面是因为每一新民主主义国家以及苏联的经济结构都是有区别的，在一定限度之内，这一国家是另一国家的补充。
    只有一个能够在经济发展中显示出各种问题及困难之完整而详尽图景的计划经济，才能够帮助着去迅速地发现这个或那个国家易于发生的障碍，并在与其他国家共同合作范围之内消灭这些障碍。只考虑及某一特定国家所碰到的不能解决的问题所需要的计划，则不考虑及其他新民主主义国家所面临着的问题。
    苏联与新民主主义国家间合作与互助的原则，是这些国家的平等和保卫着这些国家的利益。此恰恰和“马歇尔计划”成相反的对比，它是企图将其他国家置在美帝国主义统治之下。
    完成中南欧新民主主义国家与苏联之间及它们自己之间的有计划合作，是这些国家计划成功的主要保证之一。
    在资本主义之间象这样的经济合作和互助是不可想象的。这可从“马歇尔计划”中得到充分的证明，它是美国输出剩余物品和资本的工具，是美国夺取资源及原料的工具，是帝国主义领导者奴役欧洲国家和实现掠夺企图的工具。“马歇尔计划”表面上的目的是谦逊的——恢复若干欧洲国家的生产到战前水平，纵至使一九五一年也不能达到战前的消费水平。但这个目的是不能达到的，因为美帝国主义企图通过“马歇尔计划”，限制和关闭那些在世界市场上和美国工业竞争的欧洲国家的工业。美帝国主义如何苛刻地企图阻止欧洲国家能够和它竞争的工业之恢复，可从“马歇尔计划”的机器及其他工业设备下供给百分之八的事实中看出来。
    事实上，接受马歇尔计划各国正日益沦为美国的附庸，它们的工业正在更加落后于新民主主义国家，虽然其在战时所曾遭受的损失远较新民主主义国家为少。两个集团国家间工业发展速率之差别有多大，可从下面的材料见之：在一九四八年秋，马歇尔化的法国的工业生产达到一九三七年水平的百分之九十七；比利时——百分之八十五；荷兰——百分之一百零三；意大利——百分之八十三；德国联合占领区——百分之四十六。在新民主主义国家则是一种完全不同的图画。一九四八年秋，捷克工业生产较之战前达到百分之一百一十；波兰——百分之一百五十一；匈牙利——百分之一百二十七；保加利亚——百分之一百五十八。
    马歇尔化国家的经济利益之服从于美国的需要，首先是反映在生活标准中。这些国家在一九五一年每人的消费还要比战前为低；肉的消费将低百分之十五，脂肪低百分之十，面包百分之七，糖百分之八，而每人一般的消费要低百分之十。实际的结果还很可能较“马歇尔计划”所预定的更低。
    在此背影的对面，显出新民主主义国家与绝不为自己利益打算的苏联帮助之间经济合作互相有利的惊人对照，没有苏联帮助，则这些国家的计划化及国民经济的发展将是不可能的。
    在成功地完成短期计划的基础上，新民主主义国家正在达到它们经济恢复的境地，它们经济在战争和敌占领期间曾遭受着重大的损失。许多工业已经相当地超过战前的目标。他们正在草拟着长斯的计划。这些计划将是新民主主义国家经济政治进一步发展走向社会主义的有力武器。这些计划的实现，将保证社会主义经济因素的迅速发展，保证逐渐限制并进而消灭残余资本主义分子，并为扭转小规模生产走上社会主义轨道准备着先决的条件。
