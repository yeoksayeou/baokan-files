    Transforming Parasites into Producers!
    Tianjin and Beiping Will Compel Beggars to Produce
    [This Report] The work of sheltering and handling beggars in Beiping is underway. It is reported that a group of beggars will participate in the Yellow River Engineering Team.
    [This Report] To strengthen the shelter and management of beggars in Tianjin, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau convened a meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. with relevant municipal departments, district heads, and civil affairs section chiefs to discuss specific measures. With the exception of funding, which is still awaiting approval from the North China People's Government, it was decided regarding the organizational structure that the municipal government would establish a "Tianjin Beggar Shelter and Handling Committee" to uniformly lead and handle shelter and processing matters. This will enable them to learn production techniques, break away from idle parasitic lives, and find proper livelihoods. At the same time, according to the North China People's Government's measures for sheltering and handling beggars, it was decided that those beggars whose families reside outside the city should be mobilized to return home to engage in production (organized into groups by region and sent back). Those whose families reside in the city will, after a short period of education, be claimed and taken back by their families with a guarantee that they will no longer lead parasitic lives. The homeless, elderly, young, and disabled will be sent to relief homes for education and to participate in possible labor production. Those with labor power can be introduced to the Public Works Bureau to participate in labor. Ordinary beggars must learn a skill to seek a proper livelihood. Those who have undergone transformation and education and have the ability to earn a living will be allowed to seek their own livelihood freely, or suitable jobs will be recommended for them. However, professional beggars will be strictly disciplined and forced to participate in labor production, so that they thoroughly recognize that labor is glorious, gradually eliminate their parasitic ideology, and stabilize social order.

    把寄生者变成生产者！
    平津将强制乞丐生产
    【本报讯】北平市收容与处理乞丐的工作正进行中，闻将有一批乞丐参加黄河工程队工作。
    【本报讯】天津市为加强对于该市乞丐的收容和管理，昨日上午九时，市府民政局特召集市级各有关部门与各区区长、民政股长会议，研讨各项具体办法，除经费一项尚待华北人民政府批示外，关于组织机构，决定由市府设一“天津市收容处理乞丐委员会”，统一领导办理收容及处理事宜。使之学习生产技术，摆脱游闲寄生生活，谋得正当生活出路。同时，根据华北人民政府对乞丐收容处理办法，决定凡乞丐家住城市以外者，动员其回家从事生产（按地区编组遣送），家住该市者，经过短期教育，使其家庭其保领回，不能再作寄生生活；无家可归的老幼残废将分别送救济院，进行教育，使其参加可能的劳动生产。有劳动力者可介绍到工务局令其参加劳动。一般乞丐务使其学习一种技术，谋求正当生活，凡是经过改造教育，有了谋生能力，准许其自由谋生，或为其介绍适当职业；但对于职业乞丐，决严加管教，强制其参加劳动生产，使其彻底认清劳动是光荣的，逐渐消灭其寄生思想，以安定社会秩序。
