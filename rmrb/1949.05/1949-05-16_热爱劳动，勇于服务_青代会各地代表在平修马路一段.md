　　Love Labor, Be Brave to Serve
　　Youth Congress Representatives from Various Regions Repair a Section of Road in Ping
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] After the conclusion of the National Youth Congress, more than 500 youth representatives, about to return to their respective regions, repaired a section of road on East Chang'an Street in Beiping yesterday (the 15th) to promote the spirit of youth loving labor and being brave to serve.
　　Under the scorching sun, the representatives happily used shovels, hoes, and rakes to dig at earth mounds as high as five feet. They used bamboo baskets, wooden boxes, basins, and carts to carry the dirt across the tram tracks to the opposite side of the road. When the borrowed tools were insufficient, they automatically thought of borrowing tools from nearby institutions and shops to mobilize everyone. They also divided areas according to units to start a competition. The Central Plains delegation completed four hours of work in one and a half hours. After completing their task, the troop representatives displayed the spirit of youthful friendship by helping other delegations dig soil. The Northeast delegation did three times the work, and other delegations also exceeded their original plans.
　　Among the youth representatives working, many model deeds emerged. Wang Yizhen, a naval representative among the troop representatives, had never engaged in this type of labor. Three large blisters appeared on his palms while digging soil, but he insisted on not resting and continued to work even after the blisters broke. Combat hero Lu Shunbao pushed a cart full of soil back and forth from beginning to end. Fan Ronghua, a seventeen-year-old farmer representative from East China, carried forty loads of soil in two hours. A student representative from the Southeast District, who had never worked before, had her glasses blurred by sweat and dirt several times, but she still gritted her teeth and dug soil, saying, "I must study hard today." The Northwest delegation had less labor and found it difficult to compete with other delegations. Writer Ma Feng came up with a shift system that improved work efficiency. The Southwest and Southeast delegations were assigned areas with many rocks and tree roots. They showed no fear of difficulties. Instead, they happily dug soil and sang songs, calling digging up tree roots "digging up Chiang roots."
　　The scheduled working time was 4:00 PM, with a target of digging 150 cubic meters of soil. As a result, they dug more than 250 cubic meters of soil by 3:15 PM. When they successfully completed and exceeded their original work task, they immediately raised rakes, shovels, brooms, bamboo baskets, flags, coats, basins, and wooden sticks on the leveled square and started dancing the Yangko. More and more people gathered to watch. Zhang Yingxia, a 51-year-old woman from Beiping City, helped her 80-year-old mother squeeze into the crowd to watch, and also taught her son to sing "Unity is Strength."
　　Finally, Gao Tang, a member of the National Youth Federation Central Committee, encouraged all representatives to return to their respective work positions with today's labor enthusiasm and work hard. (Jin Feng)

### 热爱劳动，勇于服务　青代会各地代表在平修马路一段

　　热爱劳动，勇于服务
  　青代会各地代表在平修马路一段
    【本报讯】全国青代大会闭幕后，即将返归各地的青年代表五百余人，为了发扬青年热爱劳动，勇于服务的精神，昨（十五）日在北平东长安街修筑马路一段。
    在灼灼烈日的照射下，代表们愉快地用铁锹、锄头、钉耙，挖着高达五尺的土丘，用竹箩、木箱、脸盆和大车盛着泥土，越过电车轨道搬到对面的马路上去。借来的工具不够应用，他们就自动的想法向附近机关、商店借工具以全体出动。他们并按单位划分地区展开竞赛。中原代表团在一小时半就完成四小时的任务，部队代表完成任务后发挥青年友爱精神帮助其他代表团挖土。东北代表团做了三倍的工作，其他代表团也纷纷超过原定计划。
    在劳动的青年代表中，出现了很多模范事迹。部队代表中海军代表王颐桢是没有从事过这类性质的劳动，挖土时手掌心起了三个大水泡，坚持不肯休息，水泡破了仍旧干下去。战斗英雄吕顺保自始至终推着盛土的大车往返奔跑。华东农民代表十七岁的樊荣华两小时内担土四十担。从未劳动过的东南区学生代表的眼镜几次被汗水和泥土模糊了，而她仍旧咬着牙挖土，她说：“我今天一定要好好学习”。西北代表团劳动力少很难和别的代表团竞赛，作家马烽想出了分班制度而提高了工作效率。西南东南代表团分到的地区石块和树根很多，他们毫无畏难之色，反而很愉快地一边挖土一边唱歌，挖着了树根叫挖蒋根。
    原定劳动时间四点钟，挖土一百五十立方米，结果三点一刻钟挖土二百五十立方米以上。当他们胜利地完成并超过原定工作任务后，立刻，他们就在挖平了的广场上举起钉耙、铁铲、扫帚、竹箕、旗子、外衣、脸盆、木棍就扭起秧歌来。围着看的人愈来愈多，一个五十一岁的北平市妇女张英霞搀了她八十岁的老母亲挤进人丛去看，还教她儿子跟着唱“团结就是力量”。
    最后全国青联中央委员高棠勉励全体代表，要以今天的劳动热忱，回到各个工作岗位上去努力。　　　（金凤）
