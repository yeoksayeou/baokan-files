    Taiyuan Registers Unemployed Workers
    Introducing Occupational Organization and Production
    [Taiyuan Telegraph] Since the North China Federation of Trade Unions Taiyuan Office began operations after entering the city, the vast number of workers who had suffered under the exploitation of the Yan Faction have been voluntarily registering at the unemployed workers registration office, requesting to return to work. In the three days from the 27th to the 29th, the number reached 407 people. Among them were more than 60 car drivers and electrical workers, all of whom have been introduced to jobs by the office. Others who were living in extreme poverty and were unable to immediately return to work or be introduced to other occupations have been organized to produce for self-salvation through the "work-for-relief" method. The Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China has already issued small loans of 1 million yuan (People's Currency) on April 28th. This loan is organized and issued under the leadership of the Taiyuan Municipal Production Self-Salvation Committee, with bank personnel handling the procedures.

    太原登记失业工人
    介绍职业组织生产
    【太原电】华北总工会太原办事处，自入城办公后，饱受阎匪压榨的广大职工，纷纷自动前来失业职工登记处登记，要求复工。自二十七日至二十九日三天内，已达四零七人。其中有汽车司机与电气工人六十余人，均经办事处介绍了工作。其他一部生活极苦，又未能立即复工或介绍其他职业者，均以“以工代赈”的办法组织他们生产自救，并已由中国人民银行太原分行于四月二十八日发放小本贷款一百万元（人民券）。此项贷款由太原市生产自救委员会负责领导组织发放，银行派员办理手续。
