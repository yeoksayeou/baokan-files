The Past and Present of Nursing Education
Wang ＠瑛

Every year, May in China is a month filled with excitement and heroic commemoration. Counting on our fingers, several magnificent and moving anniversaries fall in May. The "May 12th" Nurses Day also falls at this time. Although Nurses Day does not represent a political, economic, or cultural revolutionary movement, it does symbolize the era of innovation in nursing education for nurses. The commemoration of this movement happens to be in this vibrant, joyful, and revolutionary atmosphere of May, giving those who commemorate this day a profound awakening.

Nursing work has a long history. Since the beginning of history, all activities involving participation in religious, social, medical, and military endeavors, such as caring for the elderly, raising children, comforting the sick and wounded, and nursing work, have been the prelude to the modern nursing profession.

Regarding nursing education, in short, Nightingale's creation was the turning point. Before her, nursing education, although containing content, was extremely simple and lacked standards. The level of those engaged in nursing work was also inconsistent, and most lacked organizational and leadership skills. Therefore, nursing work, apart from passively comforting the sick, lacked scientific methods and a progressive spirit, leading to a long dark period for the nursing profession. It was not until Nightingale joined nursing work that, due to her foresightful interest in nursing, extraordinary wisdom, scientific mind, and leadership ability, nursing education was lifted from the scattered, passive, narrow, passive, and oppressed constraints. She believed that nursing work was a person's vocation, holding the most basic responsibility for protecting life and health. Her writings reveal the ways, methods, and spirit of a nurse serving the people. She promoted and expanded the organization of nursing work. Thanks to her creation, nursing education began to have clear goals, scientific content, a broad scope, and professional standards.

Since the establishment of the first modern nursing school by Nightingale in 1860, nursing science has been linked to education, sociology, and medical hygiene. After Nightingale, several outstanding leaders sacrificed and struggled for nursing education. Ninety years later, nursing education is now considered a specialized education equivalent to university education.

A brief introduction to the content of urban nursing education is as follows:

(1) Objectives of Nursing Education

The purpose of nursing education is to cultivate practical and excellent nursing talents. This talent not only cares for the patient's body but also possesses the academic knowledge and skills to protect the entire health of life—from the physical and mental care of children to adults, from health education to disease care, from personal care to the promotion of family, school, factory, environmental, and social health and hygiene facilities, all of which can be handled or assisted by nurses.

A nurse who has undergone rigorous training can have the following functions:

1.  Possess exquisite and skilled clinical nursing and health guidance or demonstration skills.
2.  Possess the knowledge and skills to observe and diagnose symptoms and deal with sudden changes in conditions.
3.  Possess the knowledge and skills to maintain, promote, and restore health and prevent disease.
4.  Possess the ability to promote personal or group health education.
5.  Possess knowledge of mental hygiene and its application in nursing work.
6.  Possess the ability to identify and assist in solving medical and social problems.
7.  In order to seek the development of medical health care and social welfare undertakings, one should have the ability and cultivation to cooperate with others and promote cooperation.

(2) Content of Nursing Education

The content of nursing education can be divided into four parts:

1.  Natural Sciences (physiology, anatomy, bacteriology, personal hygiene, nutrition, etc.)
2.  Social Sciences (psychology, society, history, ethics, education, etc.)
3.  Medicine (pharmacology, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, public health, and their sub-departments)
4.  Nursing (general, specialist, and public health nursing techniques)

The above four subjects are completed in a three-year program. In addition to theoretical courses, most of the time is spent on clinical practice and fieldwork. This allows theory and practice to be linked, achieving the goal of skilled techniques through hands-on and brain-using learning.

The above is only a rough outline of the current content of urban nursing education. Although nursing education has made considerable progress, it still has many shortcomings according to the needs of the revolution. It does not yet have the spirit of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly. It is still in the stage of hired labor viewpoints and does not yet involve political awareness. Today, nursing education faces a major era of transformation. In this transformation, nurses' work must have a high degree of political self-awareness in order to liberate themselves from the oppression of semi-feudal and semi-colonial rule, learn from and unite with the nurses in the liberated areas in the direction of "workers, peasants, and soldiers," and strive to improve nursing education. We must follow the progress of the times and strive to cultivate new types of nursing workers under the leadership of the People's Government to meet the needs of the times and have value in existence.

### 护士教育的今昔

    护士教育的今昔
    王＠瑛
    每年的五月，在中国是一个充满兴奋而悲壮的纪念月。屈指计算有若干可歌可泣的纪念日都是在五月。“五一二”的护士节也是在这个时候。护士节虽然不是代表一个政治、经济或文化的革命运动，但是对于护士们它确实象征着护士教育革新的纪元，而这个运动的纪念恰巧在这朝气蓬勃、欢欣鼓舞革命气氛浓厚的五月，使纪念这个日子的人们不无深刻的觉醒。
    护士工作，具有悠久的历史。自有史以来，举凡参加各项宗教、社会、医务与军事的事业中一般的扶老、育幼、伤病慰问及护理的工作都是近代护士职业的前奏。
    关于护士教育方面，简而言之，以南丁格尔的创造为转捩。在她以前的护士教育虽有内容，但极简单且漫无标准，从事护士工作的人，程度水准亦不一致，且多无组织与领导的能力，所以护士工作除为消极的疾病慰护外，缺乏科学的方法及前进的精神，以致护理事业经过很长的黑暗时期。直到南丁格尔参加护士工作后，由于她对于护理工作有先觉的兴趣，超人的智慧，科学的头脑以及领导的才能，始将护士教育由散漫、消极、狭隘、被动的、被压迫的束缚中提举出来。她认为护理工作是人的天职，掌握着保护生活健康最基本的职责。在她的著作中流露着一个护士为人群服务的途径、方法与精神。她将护士工作的组织发扬光大。由于她的创造，护士教育始有明确的目标，科学的内容，宽广的范围，与职业的标准。
    由一八六○年南丁格尔创办的第一个近代护士学校以来，将护理学与教育学，社会学及医药卫生等科学相联系。继南丁格尔之后，有若干杰出的领袖为护士教育牺牲奋斗，直至九十年后的今日，护士教育已被认为与大学相等的专门教育之一。
    今将城市护士教育的内容简略介绍于后：
    （一）护士教育的目标
    护士教育以培植实用而优秀的护士人才为目的。这种人才，不但护理病人之身体，且具有保护人生全部健康的学术与技能——由儿童以至成人之心身保育，由健康教育以至疾病的护理，由个人护理而推及家庭、学校、工厂以及环境与社会保健及卫生的设施，均可由护士办理或协助推进。
    凡经过严格训练的护士，她可有以下的功能：
    １、具有精巧熟练的临床护理及保健指导或示范的技能。
    ２、具有观察及办解病状及应付病症骤变的知识与技能。
    ３、具有保持，促进及恢复健康与预防疾病的知识与技能。
    ４、具有推行个人或团体卫生教育的能力。
    ５、具有心理卫生的知识与其在护理工作的应用。
    ６、具有识别及协助解决医疗及社会问题的能力。
    ７、为谋求医疗保健及社会福利等事业的发展，应有与人合作及促进合作的能力与修养。
    （二）护士教育的内容
    护士教育的内容可分四部：
    １、自然科学（生理、解剖、细菌、个人卫生、营养学等）
    ２、社会科学（心理、社会、历史、伦理、教育学等）
    ３、医学（药物学、内外科、产妇科、小儿科及公共卫生等各科及其分科）
    ４、护理学（普遍，专科与公共卫生等科护理技术）
    以上四种科目在三年学程中读完，除理论课程外，大半时间用为临床实习与实地工作，这样可使理论与实习互相联系，由手脑并用的学习达到技术熟练的目标。
    以上所说仅是目前城市护士教育内容的大略。护士教育虽有长足的进步，但按照革命的需要，缺点尚多，还没有为工农兵热诚服务的精神，还处在雇佣观点的阶段，还谈不到政治觉悟。现今护士教育面临一个大时代的转变，在这个转变中，护士们的工作须有高度政治上的自觉，才能从半封建半殖民地的压迫下解放出来，向“工农兵”方向，向解放区的护士们学习与团结，努力改进护士教育，必须追随时代前进，在人民政府领导下为培养新型护理工作者而努力，以适应时代的需要才有存在的价值。
