　　Ping City General Supply and Marketing Cooperative
　　Over 300,000 Jin of Grain Sold in Half a Month
　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the Xuanwumen Grain Depot of the Ping City Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Cooperative opened on the 10th of this month, business has gradually expanded. The amount of grain entrusted to the depot for sale has exceeded 300,000 jin, mostly consisting of flour, millet, sorghum, wheat, mung beans, buckwheat, and flax. Mountain products such as almond have also reached over 5,000 jin. The grain mainly comes from Chahar, the Bohai region, and the Si Hai Cooperative. After sales, industrial products such as foreign cloth and iron plates are exchanged. The depot's staff has increased to 45 people, and all eight disk electric mills are now in operation, producing approximately 10,000 jin of flour (coarse grain) per day. However, according to the person in charge of the depot, they are currently only milling during the day due to a shortage of workers. They plan to add four more workers, which would allow them to produce 15,000 jin of flour per day. The flour milled by the depot is relatively fine, and cooperative members who have used it generally express satisfaction.

　　平市供销合作总社
  　半月售粮逾三十万斤
    【本报讯】平市合作供销总社宣武门粮货栈自本月十日开业以来，业务已逐渐开展，委托该栈代卖的粮食已超过三十万斤，多为面粉、小米、高粮、小麦、绿豆、荞麦、葫麻等。山货杏仁等亦有五千余斤。粮食多从察哈尔、渤海区及四海合作社运来，出售后即换回工业品如洋布铁板等。该栈之业务人员已增加到四十五人，八盘电磨已全部开工，每天出产面粉（粗粮）一万斤左右。但据该栈负责人谈：现在还因工人少，只白天磨面，计划再增加四个工人，每天就可出面粉一万五千斤。该栈所磨之面粉，比较精细，一般用过的社员都表示满意。
