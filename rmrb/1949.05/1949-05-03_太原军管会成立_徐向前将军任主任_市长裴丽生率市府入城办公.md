[Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan Military Control Commission, by order of the North China People's Government and the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, was formally established on April 24th. Xu Xiangqian, director of the commission, and deputy directors Luo Ruiqing, Lai Ruoyu, Hu Yaobang, and members Zhou Shidi, Luo Guibo, Xiao Wenjiu, Pei Lisheng, Xie Xuegong, Kang Yonghe, etc., all took office on that day and issued the first public notice stating: The Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops in Taiyuan have been completely annihilated, and the people of the city are celebrating the liberation. However, the war has just ended, and it is feared that villains, defeated soldiers, secret agents, and lawless elements will take the opportunity to disrupt public order, damage public property, and endanger the interests of the people. It is necessary to quickly establish a revolutionary order to protect the lives and property of the people and protect public and private factories, shops, mines, warehouses, railways, tap water, electric lights, telephones, libraries, hospitals, and all buildings from damage. To ensure the correct implementation of urban policies and the orderly and complete takeover of public enterprises, cultural, military, and political organs, so as to facilitate the city's future construction, it is ordered that military control be temporarily implemented. The establishment of the Taiyuan Military Control Commission makes it the highest authority in the city during the period of military control. All troops entering the city, Party and government organs, military and civilian organs, garrison troops, and various takeover organizations must be under the unified leadership and command of the Military Control Commission; all citizens of Taiyuan must abide by the orders of the Military Control Commission and obey its control. Military control will be lifted once order is stabilized, and the commission will be dissolved.

Furthermore, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government has been formally established and entered the city to work on April 24th. The mayor is Pei Lisheng. The municipal government also governs three districts and nineteen counties, namely Yangqu, Shouyang, Meng County, Wutai, Dingxiang, Pingding, and Xin County in the first district; Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Jiaocheng, Qingyuan, Xugou, Jinyuan in the second district; and Yuci, Qixian, Taigu, Pingyao, and Jiexiu in the third district.
