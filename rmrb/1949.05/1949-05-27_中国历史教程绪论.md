Introduction to Chinese History Tutorial

    I. The Significance of Studying Chinese History (Continued)
    China's current situation is just as Dimitrov said, where counter-revolutionary historical distortionists are playing the tricks of restoration and Confucian worship, distorting historical facts to deceive the people. What restoration movements and scripture reading movements are creating a foul atmosphere. The Brest-Litovsk Treaty incident in Soviet Russia can be used as a talisman for betrayal; Qin Hui, the traitor, can be transformed into a far-sighted "patriotic" strategist. These historical distortionists do not hesitate to distort facts and reverse right and wrong to flatter the reactionary rulers of the present day. Not long ago, before Japan surrendered, a particularly striking example was the Japanese warlord fascists, who in the Chinese territories they had occupied, on the one hand, vigorously advocated Confucian Wangdao and other dogmas, claiming to be the protectors of Chinese and Oriental civilization; on the other hand, they forced everyone in schools to learn Japanese and forbade Chinese people from reading Chinese history, attempting to eliminate Chinese national character. It would be a sin if we underestimated the deceptive tactics of reactionary forces and fascists. We Communists are internationalists and fundamentally oppose all kinds of bourgeois national aggression without compromise. However, we are not national nihilists. If anyone thinks that because they want to educate workers and all laborers with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, they can, and even must, despise all national concepts of the broad working masses, then they are gravely mistaken and do not understand Lenin and Stalin's theories on the national question at all.
    Lenin said:
    "Do we, the conscious workers of the Great Russian nation, lack national pride? Of course not! We love our language and our homeland, and we are working hardest to educate the working masses of our homeland (that is, nine-tenths of the people of our homeland) to become conscious democrats and socialists. What we find most heartbreaking is that the tyrannical royal executioners, nobles, and capitalists openly destroy, oppress, and humiliate our beautiful homeland. What we are proud of is that this policy of oppression has aroused the resistance of our Great Russian people, who have embraced Radishchev, the Decembrists, and the populist revolutionaries of the 1870s; the working class of our Great Russian nation created a powerful mass revolutionary party in 1905... We are filled with national pride because the Great Russian nation has also created a revolutionary class, and it has proven that the Great Russian nation can be a great model for humanity in the struggle for freedom and socialism, and not just a large number of trampled and oppressed people, large-scale execution grounds and prisons, large-scale famines, and the ugly spectacle of prostrating oneself before priests, emperors, landlords, and capitalists.
    "We are filled with national pride precisely because of this, so we are particularly resentful of our past slave life... and our current state of slavery. Now is the time when those landlords, concession capitalists, force us to go east and west to suppress Poland and Ukraine, suppress the democratic movements in Persia and China, so that the pack of jackals such as the Romanovs, Bobrinskys, and Purishkeviches, who tarnish the reputation of our Great Russian nation, can be even more tyrannical." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Vol. 18, p. 81, "On the National Pride of the Great Russians")
    China has a history of five thousand years, its vast territory is second only to the Soviet Union, exceeding the total area of all European countries; and its large population exceeds that of any other country, totaling about 477 million. Throughout the ages, there have been many great thinkers, outstanding military strategists, and brilliant inventors, with an exceptionally rich collection of books and literature; it is the central foundation of East Asian culture, with a traditionally developed agriculture and industry.
    As early as three thousand years ago, China had the invention of the compass, and the application of gunpowder also predates the Europeans. Paper appeared seventeen hundred years ago; block printing was invented twelve hundred years ago; and movable type printing was used eight hundred years ago. Other various beautiful and exquisite metal products, ceramics, and glossy, beautiful, and durable dyes are also famous specialties of China since ancient times. Patriotic enthusiasm and a spirit of hard work and endurance have always been characteristics of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the Chinese people have a very strong sense of national pride. For example, when Japan occupied Manchuria on "September 18th," the more than 30 million people in the three northeastern provinces and all the Chinese people were outraged by the bullying of our great Republic of China by the Japanese warlords, and they all thought of rising up to resist; even the Chinese workers in the Soviet Far East, upon hearing the news of Japan's occupation of Manchuria, said, "How dare the little Japanese occupy the land of our great country?" They usually regarded themselves as citizens of a great country, full of national pride. It is precisely because of this that the guerrilla movement in the Northeast and the revolutionary war of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the War of Resistance Against Japan, especially the great People's Liberation War that is currently underway, have created the most glorious history. They can carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the Chinese nation in repeatedly overthrowing the oppressive rule of foreign ethnic groups in the past. Our great Chinese people have embraced Hong Xiuquan, Sun Yat-sen, and the populist revolutionaries of the early 20th century, and created the Republic of China. The working class of our great Chinese nation has created a powerful mass Chinese Communist Party in the past 28 years, and has cultivated Comrade Mao Zedong, the greatest and most outstanding people's revolutionary leader in its own Chinese history. We are filled with national pride because the Great Chinese nation has also created a revolutionary class, and it has proven that the Chinese nation can be a great model for humanity in the struggle for freedom, independence, and social revolution, and not, as the Japanese scolded, "The Chinese have no patriotism"; "The Chinese have no five-minute enthusiasm"; "The Chinese are like a heap of loose sand"; "China is just an 'unorganized territory' that needs to be occupied by a strong country, China cannot be considered a country," and other nonsense. Naturally, we should not be deceived by historical distortionists and imperialist Chinese traitors. They say: "China has been conquered by foreign ethnic groups several times, such as the Mongols and Manchus, who once conquered China and ruled for hundreds of years, but were eventually conquered by the Han people. Therefore, we are not afraid of imperialist aggression now." They attempt to comfort us in this way, to eliminate our national patriotic heart for saving the nation, and to cover up their crimes of non-resistance, compromise, surrender, and betrayal. We should know that the struggle between the Mongolian and Manchu ethnic groups and the Han ethnic group is, after all, still a domestic ethnic struggle, and its nature is very different from imperialist aggression. Even if we reluctantly use it as an analogy, we must carefully understand the following two conditions: First, we have a glorious history of victorious national liberation struggles, which we can not only be proud of, but also greatly strengthen our confidence in victory. This is very precious, but this glorious history is derived from arduous struggles and is exchanged for the blood of countless national heroes with integrity. It can never be obtained by those who are servile, allow themselves to be slaughtered, and are willing to be slaves of a conquered nation. This can only be known by reading Yue Fei's "Man Jiang Hong," Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteousness," Zheng Suonan's "History of the Heart," the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's "Proclamation Against the Manchus," and many other inspiring texts and deeds of countless national heroes who sacrificed themselves for the cause of righteousness; Second, the main reason why the conquered Han people were able to overthrow the rule of the conquering Mongols and Manchus was that the economic development of the Han people was higher than that of the Mongols and Manchus, so the Han people economically made them have to assimilate or surrender, and as a result, it was easier to conquer them. As for the current imperialism, it has reached the final stage of capitalism, and its economy and all technologies are greatly superior to ours. If we allow imperialism to destroy China now, it will never be as easy to overthrow them as it was with the Mongols and Manchus in the past. We only need to look at how Korea, India, and other colonies are being trampled on by imperialism and how difficult it is for national liberation movements to succeed, and we cannot help but be awakened.
    We are filled with national pride precisely because of this, so we are particularly resentful of our past slave life and our current state of slavery. What is especially hateful is imperialism's poisonous trick of using Chinese to control Chinese, doing everything possible to provoke and aid our country's reactionary forces, causing them to wage continuous warlord wars and wars of aggression against the people's revolution, so that it can reap the benefits of the fisherman and destroy China.
    Now our great Chinese nation is at the critical juncture of the life-and-death struggle where the most sinister imperialism is doing everything possible to destroy our country and we are doing our best to strive for liberation. Only by deeply studying our history, arousing the patriotic spirit of the entire nation, uniting as one, and forming an unbreakable iron national united front, to overthrow the oppression of imperialism, and most urgently, to overthrow the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialism that is aiding Chiang Kai-shek and other feudal bureaucratic comprador counter-revolutionary groups in waging civil war, can our national revolution and social revolution be victorious.
    An even more important significance of our study of history lies in discovering the laws of human social development, especially the laws of our Chinese social development, to strengthen our people's confidence that the revolution to strive for liberation will inevitably be victorious, and to absorb the historical experiences and lessons, so that the revolution does not make mistakes, to strengthen the strength of the revolution, and to move forward along the laws of human social development. How can we discover the laws of human social development? That requires correct thinking methods, that is, to understand Marxist scientific dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Below, I will talk about the methods of studying history.

　　中国历史教程绪论
    吴玉韦
    一、研究中国历史的意义（二续）
    中国现在的情形，也正和季米特洛夫所说的一样，反革命的历史曲解家，正在玩弄复古和尊孔的把戏，曲解历史的事实来欺骗民众。什么复古运动，读经运动，闹得乌烟瘴气。苏俄布勒斯特条约的事件，可以借作卖国的护符；卖国的秦桧，可以变为深谋远虑的“爱国”策士。这些历史曲解家不惜曲解事实，颠倒是非，以阿谀当世的反动统治者。不久以前，即日本未投降以前，特别鲜明的例子，就是日本的军阀法西斯蒂，在他已占领的中国各地，一方面大倡孔子王道等教条，表示他是中国和东方文明的保护者；一方面在学校里强迫人人学日语，不许中国人读中国历史，企图消灭中国的民族性。我们如果轻视反动势力和法西斯蒂的这种骗人手腕，那就是罪恶。我们共产党员是国际主义者，毫不调和地根本反对各色各样的资产阶级的民族侵略主义，可是，我们并不是民族虚无主义者。如果谁认为，因为要用无产阶级的国际主义精神来教育工人和一切劳动者，他就可以，而且甚至于不得不唾弃广大劳动民众的一切民族观念，那么，他就大错而特错，他就毫不懂得列宁和斯大林关于民族问题的学说。
    列宁说：
    “难道我们这些大俄民族的觉悟工人，没有民族自夸心吗？当然有！我们爱自己的语言，爱自己的祖国，我们所最努力工作的，就是要教育我们祖国劳动群众（即祖国十分之九的人民）使他们成为觉悟的民主主义者和社会主义者。我们所最目击心伤的，就是暴虐无道的皇家刽子手、贵族和资本家，公然摧残压迫和侮辱我们的大好河山的祖国。我们引为自夸的，就是这种压迫政策，已经引起我们大俄人民的反抗，我们大俄人民已经推拥出拉吉雪夫、十二月党人、七十年代的平民革命家；我们大俄民族的工人阶级已经在一九○五年造成强有力的群众的革命党……我们充满着民族自夸心，因为大俄民族也造成了革命的阶级，也证明了：大俄民族能够给人类标榜为为自由为社会主义而斗争的伟大模范，而不只是大批被蹂躏被压迫的民众，大辟刑场监狱，大闹饥荒以及在神父、皇帝、地主和资本家面前大显卑躬屈节的丑态。
    “我们充满着民族自夸心，正因为这个缘故，所以我们特别愤恨自己的以往的奴隶生活……以及现在的奴隶状况。现在的时候，又是那般地主、协定资本家、强迫我们东征西剿，去扑灭波兰和乌克兰，镇压波斯和中国的民主运动，使罗曼诺夫、包白林斯基、普利史克维赤这般玷污我们大俄民族名声的狐群狗党，更能作威作福。”（“列宁全集”第十八卷，第八十一页，“大俄罗斯人底民族自夸心”）
    我们中国有五千年的历史，其幅员的广大，仅次于苏联；超过全欧各国面积的总和；而其人口的众多，则为任何国家所不及，总数约在四万万七千万以上。历代以来，有不少伟大的思想家、卓绝的军事家及出色的发明家，有异常丰富的典籍文艺；实为东亚文化的中心基础，有素称发达的农业和工业。
    远在三千年以前，中国已有了指南针的发明，而火药的应用，亦远在欧洲人以前。在一千七百年前，即有纸张的出现；在一千二百年前，已有刻版印刷的发明；在八百年前则更有活字印刷术的使用。其他各种华美精致的金属品、陶瓷器及光泽美观经久的染料，亦为中国自古著名的特产。而爱国热忱及勤苦耐劳的精神，尤为中华民族向来的特色。因此，中国人民有很强的民族自夸心。例如：当“九·一八”日本占领满洲的时候，东三省三千多万人民及全中国人民无不愤恨日本军阀之欺凌我大中华民国，莫不思起而反抗；就是在苏联远东的中国工人，一听到日本占领满洲的消息都说道：“小日本子何敢占我大国的土地”，平素也常常以大国人自居，充满着民族自夸心。正因为这个缘故，所以东北的游击运动和中国工农红军的革命战争及抗日战争，尤其是现在进行着的伟大的人民解放战争，创造出最光荣的历史。他们能够发扬光大中华民族过去迭次推翻外族压迫统治的革命传统。我们大中华人民，已经推拥出洪秀全、孙中山及二十世纪初的平民革命家，创造了中华民国，我们大中华民族的工人阶级，已经在最近二十八年来，造成强有力的群众性的中国共产党，并锻炼出了自己的中国历史上最伟大最杰出的人民革命领袖毛泽东同志。我们充满着民族自夸心，因为大中华民族，也造成了革命阶级，也证明了，中华民族能够给人类标榜为为自由为独立和为社会革命而斗争的伟大模范，而不是如日本人所骂的：“中国人无爱国心”；“中国人没有五分钟的热心”；“中国人如一盘散沙”；“中国只是一块需要强国来占领的‘无组织的领土’，中国不能算是一个国家”等等胡说。自然，我们不应该受历史曲解家和帝国主义汉奸走狗的欺骗。他们说：“中国曾经几次被外族征服过，如蒙古人、满洲人都曾经征服过中国，统治了几百年，而终竟还是被汉族征服了，因此，现在帝国主义的侵略，我们是不怕的。”他们企图这样来安慰我们，以消灭我们救亡图存的民族爱国心，以掩饰他们不抵抗求妥协和投降卖国的罪恶。我们应该知道蒙古民族和满洲民族与汉族的斗争，毕竟还是国内民族的斗争，和帝国主义的侵略，其性质已大不同，即使勉强用来比拟，我们也要好好地懂得下面两个条件：第一，我们有胜利的民族解放斗争的光荣历史，这不仅可以自夸，而且可以十分坚强我们胜利的自信心，这是很可宝贵的，但这个光荣历史是由艰苦斗争中得来，是由无数的有气节的民族英雄的热血换来，绝不是卑躬屈节、任人宰割、甘作亡国奴的人所能侥幸得到的。这只须一读岳飞的“满江红”，文天祥的“正气歌”，郑所南的“心史”，太平天国“讨满洲檄文”及其他许许多多慷慨激昂的文字，和无数成仁取义民族英雄之事迹，就可以知道；第二，被征服的汉族能推翻征服者的蒙古人和满洲人的统治，最主要的是由于以前汉族的经济发展高于蒙古族和满族，因而汉族在经济上使它们不能不同化或降服，结果也就易于征服他们。至于现在的帝国主义，它已经走到资本主义最后阶段，经济和一切技术都大大的高过我们。如果坐令帝国主义现在灭亡中国，绝不会象从前蒙古人满洲人一样，很容易的就把他们打倒了。我们只要看朝鲜、印度等殖民地，是怎样地受帝国主义的蹂躏和民族解放运动的难于胜利，就不能不惊醒了。
    我们充满着民族自夸心，正因为这个缘故，所以我们特别愤恨自己的已往的奴隶生活以及现在的奴隶状况。尤其使人痛恨的是帝国主义以华制华的毒计，多方挑拨援助我国反动势力，使之进行连续不断的军阀战争和进攻人民革命的战争，以便他坐收渔人之利，以灭亡中国。
    现在我们大中华民族正处在最阴毒的帝国主义多方灭亡我国和我们极力争取解放的生死斗争关头，只有深刻的研究我们的历史，唤起全民族的爱国精神，团结一致，结成牢不可破的钢铁一般的民族统一战线，来推翻帝国主义的压迫，最迫切地是打倒卖国贼蒋介石和援助蒋介石等封建官僚买办反革命集团进行内战的美国帝国主义，我们的民族革命和社会革命才能得到胜利。
    我们研究历史更重要的意义尤在于发现人类社会发展的规律，特别是发现我们中国社会发展的规律，以加强我们人民争取解放的革命必然获得胜利的信心，和吸取历史上的经验教训，使革命不犯错误，以加强革命的力量，循着人类社会发展的规律向前迈进。要怎样才能发现人类社会发展的规律呢？那就必须要有正确的思想方法，就是说要了解马克思主义的科学的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义。下面我就讲研究历史的方法。
