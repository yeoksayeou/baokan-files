　　Continuing to Eliminate Insects in Jingxing and Other Places
    [Our Newspaper] Jingxing, Fangshan and other places have successively captured and eliminated insect pests. In Faluling Village, Jingxing Ninth District, more than 20 mu of wheat fields were found to have insects on April 29th, spreading to more than 80 mu. Under the leadership of district and village cadres, all the men and women in the village were organized, and the pests were completely eliminated after seven days. North melons and other crops are now being replanted in the affected areas. In Baibiao and other villages in the Fourth District of the county, wheat-eating insects were also discovered in early May, and they have now been completely eliminated. In Xiatan and other nine villages in Fangshan Third District, hairy caterpillars and gray caterpillars on hawthorn trees were very harmful. After organizing the beating, all were wiped out. According to statistics from six villages including Caijiazhuang, 962 jin of insects were killed. More than 30 percent of the 2,400-plus jujube trees in Shengzhao Village had their buds eaten by insects. We are now actively studying ways to eliminate them. The Hebei Province Fruit Tree Pest Control Promotion Team is preventing and controlling insect pests in various places. The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture recently issued an instruction letter to educate team members to use facts to break the masses' superstitious concept of "god worms"; vigorously publicize the benefits of sprayers, mobilize the masses to buy them jointly, so that scientific equipment can be gradually mastered and used by the masses; pest control should be combined with the daily management of fruit trees, such as peeling bark, picking rolled leaves, weeding, cultivating the land, and thinning fruit.
    Recently, the North China Farm has researched one of the effective methods for treating fire dragons (fire spiders) in Liucun, Zhengding: 1. Water irrigation and beating method: after slightly raising the wheat ridges, irrigate with water. After irrigating one ridge, repeatedly sweep the wheat with a broom to drown the fire dragons in the water; 2. Oil injection and irrigation method: The method is slightly the same as the previous one, except that kerosene is added between the wheat ridges after irrigation (12 taels to 1 jin of oil per mu).

　　井陉等地继续灭虫
    【本报讯】井陉、房山等地相继捕灭虫害。井陉九区乏驴岭村，上月二十九日发现二十余亩麦田生虫，蔓延至八十余亩。在区、村干事领导下，组织了全村男女，经七日已完全扑灭。被害地内现正补种北瓜等作物。该县四区白彪等村，五月初亦发现吃麦虫，现亦全部扑灭。房山三区下滩等九村，红果树上毛虫及灰灰虫为害甚巨，经组织扑打，全部扑灭，仅据蔡家庄等六个村统计，即杀虫九百六十二斤。胜照村二千四百余株枣树，被虫把芽吃掉者有百分之三十，现正积极研究扑灭办法。察哈尔省防治果树虫害推广队在各地防治虫害，察省农业处近特发出指示信，教育队员，要用事实破除群众迷信“神虫”的观念；大力宣传喷雾器的好处，发动群众合伙购买，以期科学用具逐渐为群众掌握使用；防除虫害应与果树日常管理相结合，如剥树皮、摘卷叶、除草、耕地、疏果等。
    华北农场近于正定留村研究出治火龙（火蛛子）的有效办法之一、灌水扑打法将麦畦稍垒高后，以水灌溉，浇完一畦就用帚帚在麦上反复扫动，使火龙落水淹死；二、注油灌水法：其方法略与前同，只是在灌水毕在麦垄间加注煤油（每亩用油十二两至一斤）。
