　　The liberation of Shanghai has evoked cheers from the entire Chinese people and all progressive humanity around the world. This is because, first, Shanghai is China's largest economic center, and the liberation of Shanghai indicates that the Chinese people have overthrown their enemy, the Kuomintang reactionaries, militarily, politically, and economically; second, Shanghai is the main base for imperialist aggression against China, and the liberation of Shanghai indicates that the Chinese people have established the foundation for national independence. These two situations give the liberation of Shanghai special significance in the cause of the Chinese people's liberation.
    Shanghai's destiny is, in fact, an epitome of modern Chinese history. On the one hand, imperialist adventurers once regarded Shanghai as their paradise, creating all kinds of crimes of robbery, massacre, insult, and deception against the Chinese people in Shanghai. The last big running dog of imperialism in China, the last tyrant of Chinese feudalism, and the great accumulator of bureaucratic capitalism, Chiang Kai-shek, started from the gangster organizations in Shanghai, and gained cheers from domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces for causing the great bloodshed of Shanghai workers, establishing his twenty-two years of dark rule based on Shanghai's comprador economy, and even to the end, bid farewell to the people of Shanghai with slaughter and destruction. On the other hand, Shanghai is also the cradle of modern China's light. Shanghai is the base of the Chinese working class and the birthplace of the Communist Party of China, and for a long time, it was the guiding center of the Chinese revolutionary movement. Although the counter-revolutionary forces used savage white terror to force the main force of the Chinese revolution to shift from the cities to the countryside, Shanghai remained one of the main fortresses of the Chinese workers' movement, the revolutionary cultural movement, and the patriotic democratic movement of various democratic strata. Shanghai's revolutionary forces cooperated with the national revolution, which led to the liberation of Shanghai.
    The liberation of Shanghai will, of course, accelerate the completion of a series of fundamental changes in China's internal and external relations, and these fundamental changes will, of course, make the position of the new China brighter day by day. After the liberation of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Hankou, Xi'an and other key cities, China's counter-revolution has been shattered into scattered small parts, fleeing into remote areas, and these hastily built counter-revolutionary nests can never last long. Although China must still bear the burden of the final stage of the war in the short term, production and construction have become increasingly important tasks. Shanghai and other major Chinese cities were previously unable to develop production smoothly and often became obstacles to production. This era has passed. The enemies of the Chinese revolution threatened the Chinese people, saying: You dare not occupy Shanghai because you cannot manage it unless you surrender to us. These boastful people also set various patterns to comfort themselves and each other. But now is not the time for them to continue winning money in the casino. They have repeatedly failed in the China issue, and if they do not believe that the Chinese people can manage Shanghai well, then they can only add another failure. Shanghai is a city of production and a city of revolution. After the counter-revolutionary rule is destroyed, this characteristic will show great power. Shanghai's hundreds of thousands of workers, hundreds of thousands of other working people, hundreds of thousands of intellectuals, and patriotic national bourgeoisie are now united for the first time without oppression. Shanghai and other cities in the country, and the rural areas of the country, are now also linked together for the first time without oppression. Despite the war, the long-term destruction by the enemy, and the continued destruction by covert means, and the lack of mature experience, various expected and unexpected difficulties will inevitably be encountered on the road forward. We must not underestimate these difficulties. Whoever underestimates these difficulties and does not take serious steps to overcome them will make a huge mistake; but these difficulties, with the concerted efforts of the democratic strata in Shanghai and the concerted efforts of the democratic strata throughout the country, can be overcome by relying on ourselves.
    Shanghai is a world-class city, so the liberation of Shanghai is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a world-class victory for the international peace and democracy camp. It is completely understandable and beneficial that different people in the world have shown different reactions to the liberated Shanghai and the liberated China, because this allows the Chinese people to easily recognize their faces. The Chinese people have long announced a clear position on international affairs, the most recent of which was the statement by General Li Tao, spokesperson for the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on April 30. General Li Tao said: "The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are willing to protect foreign nationals in China who are engaged in normal business. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with various foreign countries, but this relationship must be based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, independence, and integrity, and first of all, various foreign countries must not help the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are unwilling to accept any threatening actions from any foreign government. If a foreign government is willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with us, it must sever relations with the remaining forces of the Kuomintang and withdraw its armed forces in China." This statement is fair and reasonable, and there is no doubt that the Chinese people support the position of this statement. The Chinese people are willing to cooperate in a friendly manner with any foreign people in Shanghai or anywhere else, but some foreign governments not only were in the past but still are now standing with the Kuomintang reactionaries against the Chinese people, then, of course, there is nothing strange in people thinking that these governments are adopting an unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people. If these foreign governments are willing to start learning lessons from the China incident, then they should begin to change their erroneous policy of interfering in China's internal affairs and adopt a policy of establishing friendly relations with the Chinese people.

### 祝上海解放

　　祝上海解放
    上海的解放，引起了全中国人民和全世界进步人类的欢呼。这是因为，第一、上海是中国的最大的经济中心，上海的解放表示中国人民无论在军事上、政治上和经济上都已经打倒了自己的敌人国民党反动派；第二、上海是帝国主义侵略中国的主要基地，上海的解放表示中国人民已经确立了民族独立的基础。这两种情况，使得上海的解放在中国人民解放事业中具有特殊的意义。
    上海的命运实际上是近代中国历史的缩影。在一方面，帝国主义的冒险家们曾经把上海看成是自己的乐园，在上海制造了种种盗劫、屠杀、侮辱和愚弄中国人民的罪恶。帝国主义在中国的最后一个大走狗，中国封建主义的最后一个暴君和官僚资本主义的集大成者蒋介石，就是由上海的流氓组织起家，因为造成了上海工人的大流血得到国内外反革命势力的喝彩，建立起他的以上海买办经济为基础的二十二年的黑暗统治，并且直到最后，还以屠杀和破坏来向上海人民告别的。在另一方面，上海又是近代中国的光明的摇篮。上海是中国工人阶级的大本营和中国共产党的诞生地，在长时期间它是中国革命运动的指导中心。虽然在反革命势力以野蛮的白色恐怖迫使中国革命的主力由城市转入乡村以后，上海仍然是中国工人运动、革命文化运动和各民主阶层爱国民主运动的主要堡垒之一。上海的革命力量和全国的革命相配合，这就造成了上海的解放。
    上海的解放当然要加速完成中国内外关系的一系列根本变化，这些根本变化当然要使新中国的地位一天比一天光明。在上海、南京、杭州、九江、南昌、汉口、西安等枢纽城市解放以后，中国的反革命已经被打碎成为零星的小部，逃入边远的地区，而这些仓卒筑成的反革命巢穴也绝不能维持多久。中国在短期间虽然还必须负着战争的最后阶段的负担，但是生产建设已经成为一天比一天重要的课题。上海和其他中国大城市在以前曾经不能够顺利地发展生产，并且常常成为生产的障碍物，这种时代已经过去了。中国革命的敌人恐吓中国人民说：你们不敢占领上海，因为你们无法管理它，除非你们向我们屈服。这些大言不惭的人们并且设定种种的图案来安慰自己和互相安慰。但是现在不是他们在赌博场中继续赢钱的时候了。他们在中国的问题上已经再三失败，如果他们不相信中国人民能够把上海管理得好，那么他们只能再增加一次失败。上海是一个生产的城市和革命的城市，在反革命统治被捣毁以后，这个特征将要显出伟大的威力。上海的几十万工人，几十万其他劳动人民，几十万知识分子，和有爱国心的民族资产阶级，现在是第一次不受压迫地联合在一起。上海和全国的其他城市，和全国的乡村，现在也是第一次不受压迫地联结在一起。尽管因为战争，因为敌人施行了长期的破坏并将以隐蔽的方法继续破坏，还因为缺少成熟的经验，在前进的道路上必然要遇到各种意料之内和意料之外的困难，我们决不可轻视这些困难，谁要是轻视这些困难，因而不去采取认真想法克服这些困难的步骤，我们就会要犯极大的错误；但是这些困难在上海各民主阶层的协力奋斗之下，在全国各民主阶层的协力奋斗之下，没有不可以依靠自己而克服的。
    上海是一个世界性的城市，所以上海的解放不但是中国人民的胜利，而且是国际和平民主阵营的世界性的胜利。对于解放了的上海和解放了的中国，世界上的不同人物表示了不同的反应，这是完全可以理解的，并且是有益的，因为这使中国人民可以很容易地认识他们的面孔。中国人民对于国际事务早已宣布了鲜明的立场，其最近一次便是四月三十日中国人民解放军总部发言人李涛将军的声明。李涛将军说：“中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府愿意保护从事正常业务的在华外国侨民。中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府愿意考虑和各外国建立外交关系，这种关系必须建立在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的独立和完整的基础之上，首先是各外国不能帮助国民党反动派。中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府不愿意接受任何外国政府所给予的任何带威胁性的行动。外国政府如果愿意考虑和我们建立外交关系，它就必须断绝和国民党残余力量的关系，并将它在中国的武装力量撤回去。”这个声明是公平合理的，毫无疑问，中国人民是支持这个声明的立场的。中国人民愿意在上海或在其他任何地方和任何外国人民友好合作，但是若干外国的政府不但过去是而且现在仍然是和国民党反动派站在一起反对中国人民，那么，人们之认为这些政府是采取了一种对于中国人民的不友善态度，当然没有什么奇怪。这些外国政府如果愿意开始从中国事变中吸取教训，那么，它们就应当着手改变它们干涉中国内政的错误政策，采取和中国人民建立友好关系的政策。
