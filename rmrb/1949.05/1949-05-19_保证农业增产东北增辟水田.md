Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. To ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production increase plan, people's governments at all levels in Northeast China are actively leading farmers to open up and restore paddy fields. In Mishan, Huanan, Boli, Wuchang and other five counties of Songjiang Province, more than 166,500 mu of new paddy fields have been opened. Jilin Province, a rice seedling production area, plans to open and restore 150,000 mu of paddy fields this year (excluding the area newly transferred from Liaobei Province). Heilongjiang Province has mobilized urban poor people, small vendors and mobile peddlers to go to the countryside to cultivate rice fields. Among them, Nehe County can complete the plan of increasing rice planting by 11,000 mu this year due to the increase of this labor force. The Rehe Provincial People's Government has allocated 2 billion Northeast currency as water conservancy loans to help ten counties and banners under its jurisdiction, as well as areas under the jurisdiction of the Zhaowuda League (equivalent to a province) in Inner Mongolia, to restore and open up more than 51,900 mu of rice fields. The Toutaoyingzi and other five villages in Longhua County organized rice field cooperatives to transform river channels to irrigate rice fields, and have now opened up 1,700 mu of rice fields. Luanping County has exceeded this year's plan of opening 12,000 mu of rice fields. The three major water conservancy projects in Gushan County and Andong County of Liaodong Province are about to be completed, and after completion, 26,000 mu of paddy fields can be restored and newly opened. A district in Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, has turned 13,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

　　保证农业增产东北增辟水田
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北各地人民政府积极领导农民开辟与恢复水田，以保证完成今年农业增产计划。松江省密山、桦南、勃利、五常等五县，现已新开水田十六万六千五百余亩。水稻秧产区吉林省今年计划新开与恢复水田十五万亩（新由辽北省划入地区未计算在内）。黑龙江省已动员城市贫民、小摊贩及流动商贩下乡开种稻田，其中讷河县由于增加了这批劳动力，今年可以完成增种水田一万一千亩的计划。热河省人民政府已拨出水利贷款二十亿元东北币，帮助所属十个县、旗及内蒙昭乌达盟（相当于省）所辖地区恢复与开辟稻田五万一千九百余亩。该省隆化县头道营子等五村组织了稻田合作社，进行改造河道灌溉水田，现已开出水田一千七百亩。滦平县则已超过今年开水田一万二千亩的计划。辽东省孤山县及安东县境内三大水利工程即将完成，工成后可恢复与新开两万六千亩水田。辽西省新民县一个区，已将一万三千亩旱田变成水田。
