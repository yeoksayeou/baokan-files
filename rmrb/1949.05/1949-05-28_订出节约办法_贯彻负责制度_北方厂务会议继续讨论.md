　　Formulate Economy Measures
  　Implement Responsibility System
  　Northern Factory Affairs Conference Continues Discussion
    [Our Newspaper News] The Northern Factory Affairs Conference continued yesterday (the 27th) to discuss how to strictly implement economy and improve work efficiency. After a heated discussion, it was unanimously agreed that strictly implementing economy and improving work efficiency are the urgent tasks at present, and specific implementation measures were formulated. In terms of economy: the first is the economy of power: including electricity, steam, wind, and water, a certain amount of power should be allocated according to certain needs; circuits, air ducts, steam ducts, and water ducts must be controlled separately; equipment should be inspected regularly, and the unprincipled use of power should be strictly prohibited, and water quality should be checked and improved. The second is the economy of fuel. The quality of coal coke and grease must be strictly checked, the correct usage standard must be mastered, the furnace must be washed regularly, the boiler and furnace equipment must be checked regularly, and the storage must be strengthened. In terms of general material conservation, it is necessary to ensure the correct loss of iron and copper, ensure that large materials are not used to make small items, that long materials are not used to make short items, strictly determine the processing limits, strictly prohibit driving empty cars, thoroughly utilize materials, and make full use of old materials, waste products, or substitutes, to ensure labor and material savings, while taking quality into account. In order to complete the above requirements, the leadership units should specifically understand the factory's capacity, tasks, and needs, formulate work plans, oppose blind production, and establish a responsibility system to avoid all waste. The heads of each factory and section working unit should strictly study and review the material usage of the unit. Each direct user of materials should ensure that the following are achieved: (1) Always check themselves to see if they have strictly implemented the economy system; (2) If materials are wasted consciously or unconsciously, they should sincerely accept criticism from others; (3) If they find that others have wasted materials, they should make well-intentioned criticisms; (4) They should learn from comrades who have achieved success in saving. On the issue of improving work efficiency, everyone believed that: scientifically organizing manpower and machines and launching competitions is an important part of improving work efficiency in the future. In terms of strength organization, the responsibility system must be implemented: (1) Repair, inspection and responsibility system for locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars; (2) Responsibility system for mechanical contracting, use, inspection and repair; (3) Responsibility system for producing finished products; (4) Responsibility system for tool management, use, and repair; (5) Responsibility system for material management, use, purchase, and inspection. At the same time, it is necessary to formulate a detailed production plan, extensively solicit opinions from employees, determine work steps and methods, estimate materials, estimate labor, and inspect work. Machines that have not been repaired should be repaired as soon as possible, and production efficiency should be further improved as soon as possible, and machinery should not be allowed to stagnate in the old state for a long time. Some machines with incomplete equipment can be appropriately transformed or repaired based on the existing equipment status to enhance production and improve quality. For each machine and each job, the maximum output should be studied within a certain work period (half a month or a month) as the standard for the future, and it should not be lowered, and efforts should be made to continue to improve it. Then the inspectors should further check whether each machine and each job has reached the saturation point of the due production volume. Otherwise, it can be further divided into several striving levels and gradually increased on a regular basis. When machines and manpower have surplus production capacity in addition to normal work, spare parts should be manufactured in a planned manner. In terms of manpower organization, all unnecessary waste of manpower must be overcome, workers who are free from work should be drawn to participate in the work of busy sections, appropriate work tasks should be assigned according to the technical conditions of the workers, and the concept of employees being limited to personal experience and self-closure should be eliminated. It is necessary to learn and absorb new working methods and technologies, and carry out the movement to respect teachers and love apprentices. Establish a reward and punishment system. Some welfare issues of workers should be resolved immediately under the current possible conditions.

　　订出节约办法
  　贯彻负责制度
  　北方厂务会议继续讨论
    【本报讯】北方厂务会议于昨（二十七）日继续讨论如何严格实行节约，提高工作效率。经过热烈讨论后，一致通过以严格实行节约，提高工作效率为当前急务，同时订出具体实行办法。在节约方面：首先是动力的节约：包括电、汽、风、水，应根据一定的需要，配属一定的动力；电路、风道、汽道、水道必须分别节制；并定期检查设备，严格禁止无原则的使用动力，检查和改善水质。其次是燃料的节约，要严格检查煤焦、油脂的品质，掌握正确的使用标准量，定期洗炉，定期检查锅炉及熔炉设备，加强保管。在一般的材料节约上，要保证化铁化铜的正确损耗量，保证不以大制小，以长就短，严格确定加工限度，严格禁止开空车，应彻底利用材料，尽量利用旧材、废品或代用品，保证省工省料，质量兼顾。为完成以上要求，各领导单位要具体了解工厂能力、任务、需要，订定工作计划，反对盲目生产，建立负责制度，以避免一切浪费。各厂、段工作单位负责人要严格研究和审核该单位用料情形，各直接用料者要保证作到下列各项：（一）时时刻刻检查自己，是否严格实行了节约制度；（二）自觉或不自觉的浪费了材料，应诚意接受别人的批评；（三）发现别人有浪费材料的情形，要善意提出批评意见；（四）要向节约有成绩的同志看齐。在提高工作效率问题上，大家认为：科学的把人力和机器组织起来，展开竞赛，是今后提高工作效率的重要环节。在力量组织上要贯彻负责制：（一）机、客、货车包修、包检负责制；（二）机械包、包用、包检、包修负责制；（三）生产成品负责制；（四）工具包管、包用、包修负责制；（五）材料管理、使用、购买、检查负责制。同时必须制定周密的生产计划，广泛征求职工意见，确定工作步骤和工作方法、估料、估工、检工。未修好的机器要赶紧修理好，早日进一步提高生产效能，不能让机械长久停滞于旧有的状态。某些设备不完全的机器，可就现有的设备状态，适当的加以改造或修理，以增强生产、提高品质。对每台机器、每个工作，在一定工作期内（半月或一月），研究出他的最高生产量，作为今后的标准，不再降低下去，并应力求继续提高，然后由检工人员再进一步检查每台机器和每个工作是否已达到应有的生产量的饱和点。否则。可再分成几个奋斗阶级，按期逐步提高。机器和人力在进行正常工作以外有剩余生产能力时，应有计划的进行制造配件。在人力组织上，一切不必要的人力浪费现象要力求克服，抽取工作松闲的人员参加繁忙部分的工作，根据工人技术条件，分配适当的工作任务，去掉职工拘泥于个人经验主义与固步自封的观念。要学习和吸取新的工作方法和技术，开展尊师爱徒运动。建立奖惩制度。对工人某些福利问题，在目前可能条件下，能解决的要即时解决。
