    Jianzhuang Village Party Members
    How to Implement Production Plans?
    Jianzhuang is a village with a relatively strong work foundation in the Fourth District of Daming County. The village has a total of 217 households and 24 party members, who have always been active in their work. In particular, after the correct implementation of the party rectification policy last winter, the ideological style of party members has significantly improved. This spring, considerable achievements have been made in leading the implementation of production plans. The main experiences are: 1. Holding symposiums with experienced farmers to deeply understand the situation and absorb production knowledge: Jianzhuang is very close to the Zhang River, so some of the land is sandy and not easy to cultivate. To this end, five experienced farmers from the village were specially invited, along with the village cadres, to hold a production symposium. In a casual and enlightening way, they talked about how to cultivate sandy land. They said, "Sandy land is windy and seedlings rarely grow. It is best to plant after the Beginning of Summer. Because after the Beginning of Summer, small grasses grow on the ground, and the seedlings are less likely to be blown away by the wind. Sandy land is most suitable for planting beans, while grains such as millet are difficult to grow. Sandy land has many ground insects that bite the roots of the seedlings and are easily blown away. The advantage of planting beans is that they are not easily eaten by insects or flooded. As long as the beans grow as tall as chopsticks, they are less likely to be blown away. At the same time, sandy land is not suitable for early plowing or plowing in dry weather. If plowed early, the loose soil will be easily blown away when the spring wind rises. The advantage of plowing on rainy days is that the soil is firm, not permeable to wind, and not easily blown away." The cadres gained a lot of new knowledge about sandy land cultivation methods, which greatly helped in guiding production. 2. Mobilizing party members and cadres to implement household-based plans: In order to truly fulfill the Party's call for increasing the yield of coarse grains by five liters to one peck per mu, Hu Rushao, the village party secretary, immediately convened a branch meeting for repeated discussions and precise calculations; it was decided to carry out intensive cultivation, more hoeing, more plowing, and more fertilizer application to resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the Party. Finally, everyone discussed how to help the masses formulate production increase plans, and decided that each party member should guarantee to help one household formulate a production increase plan. In addition, there are two farmers' association group leaders among the party members, each group having ten households. First, ensure that the plans for the two groups are formulated, so there will be more than 40 households. With these 40-plus households linked together, gradually the whole village will achieve having a plan for every family and increasing production for every household, and finally, the village's production plan will not fail. Under the promotion of party members, more than half of the masses in the village have now formulated household-based production increase plans.

    尖庄村党员
    怎样贯彻生产计划？
    尖庄是大名县第四区一个工作基础较好的村庄，该村共二百十七户，党员二十四名，一向工作积极。特别是经过去冬正确的执行了整党政策，党员思想作风均有显著进步。今春在领导贯彻生产计划上取得相当成绩，主要经验是：一、召开老农座谈会，深入了解情况吸取生产知识：尖村距漳河很近，故有一部土地是飞沙地，不易种植。为此特邀请了本村五位富有农业经验的老农，连同本村干部，举行生产座谈，以漫谈和启发方式，谈起如何养种沙地时，他们说：“沙地风多很少成苗，最好在立夏以后种。因为过了立夏地上出了小草，再起风不易将苗刮死。沙地最宜种豆，谷黍之类则很难成苗。沙地多地皮虫子，光咬苗根，又容易被刮死。种豆类的好处是不易被虫吃、水淹，只要豆子长一筷子高也就不易被刮死了，同时沙地不易早耕和旱天耕，如早耕过春风起来，耕过的松土很容易刮走。雨天耕的好地处是实，不透风，不易刮走”。干部们对沙地耕植方法上，获得了很多新知识。对领导生产有很大帮助。二、发动党员干部，贯彻按家计划：为真正完成党号召的每亩增产五升至一市斗粗粮，该村支书胡如杓当即召开支部会议，反复讨论，精确计算；决以精耕细作，多锄多耕多上肥料，坚决完成党给予的任务。最后大家又商讨如何帮助群众订定增产计划，决定每个党员保证帮助一户群众订出增产计划。此外，党员内有两个农会小组长。每组十户，首先保证把两组计划订出，这样就有四十多户。有这四十多户串通，逐渐把全村达到家家有计划，户户能增产，最后订出全村生产计划就不会落空。在党员这样的推动下，现该村已有半数已上群众，订出了按家增产计划。
