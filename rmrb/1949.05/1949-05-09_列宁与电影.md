    Lenin and Cinema
    In the Soviet era, the number of Soviet cinemas and film installations has increased more than thirtyfold. This very rapid development is due to the Soviet state's extreme attention to cinema. Lenin said: "Of all the arts, cinema is the most important to us." He believed that cinema should not only provide cultural entertainment for the Soviet people, but also be a promoter of socialist ideology, a popularizer of Soviet progressive science, and an educator of new and lofty moral qualities. Lenin's ideas are the action program of the Soviet film industry. He particularly emphasized the necessity of introducing cinema into rural areas and formerly backward regions. Lenin's instruction has been realized. In 1915, Tsarist Russia had a total of 133 film installations in rural areas, while in 1940, the Soviet Union had nearly 19,000. The progress of cinema in Central Asia is even more significant: before the revolution, there was not a single film installation in the rural areas of Central Asia, and the people of Tashkent and Kivenjiz did not even know what cinema was; today, Uzbekistan alone has 966 sound cinemas and film installations, of which 673 are in rural areas. To serve the people in remote rural areas, there are also mobile film installations. Today, there is no village in the Soviet Union that does not show movies. Many member republics have film studios producing feature films and newsreels in various languages.

    列宁与电影
    在苏维埃年代里，苏联电影院和电影装置的数目增加了三十多倍。这一非常迅速的发展，乃是由于苏维埃国家对电影极为注意。列宁说过：“在一切艺术形式中，电影对我们是最重要的。”他认为电影不但应当给苏联人民供给文化娱乐，而且应当是社会主义思想的宣传者，苏联进步科学的普及者和新的崇高道德品质的教育者。列宁的这些思想就是苏联电影界的行动纲领。他曾特别强调把电影引入农村及从前落后地区的必要。列宁的这一指示已经实现了。一九一五年沙俄乡村共有电影装置一百三十三处，而一九四○年苏联乡村则有将近一万九千处。在中亚细亚，电影的进展更加显著：革命以前中亚西亚乡村连一处电影装置也没有，至于塔什克和基文吉兹的人民，则根本不知电影为何物；今天仅乌兹别克就有有声电影院和电影装置九百六十六处，其中六百七十三处在乡间。为了给边僻乡村的人民服务，还没有流动电影装置。今天苏联已没有一个乡村不演电影。许多盟员共和国都没有制片厂，制作各种语言的艺术片和新闻片。
