    Japanese People Determined to Oppose New War
    Tokyo Holds Peace Rally
    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] According to TASS news: Prominent Japanese scientists, artists, and representatives from over a hundred democratic organizations, totaling more than 1,300 people, held a peace rally in Tokyo on the 25th and 26th of last month. Many progressive individuals from China and Korea in Japan also attended the rally. Speakers pointed out that Japan's democracy and independence are among the conditions for achieving peace. The Japanese people are willing to fight for lasting peace and against those who provoke new wars. The rally reflected the sentiments and desires of the majority of Japanese people. The rally adopted a program and declaration, resolving to use all their strength to oppose new wars, eliminate fascist military alliances, and strive for the rapid signing of a peace treaty. The declaration stated: When the Japanese people, after a long period of hardship, obtained peace, opponents of peace are again issuing cries for war. This mad barking indicates that the fascist remnants again want to obtain higher profits from war.
