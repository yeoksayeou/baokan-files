　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th: Warsaw dispatch: The acting chairman of the Polish Trade Union Central Committee, Burski, spoke to reporters from the Polish News Agency about the preparations for the upcoming National Trade Union Congress. Burski said: Our goal is to mobilize all 3.5 million of our trade union members to further increase production, improve the material and cultural conditions of the working class, and raise the political awareness of trade union members. More than 1,600 industrial enterprises and 123 farms across the country have submitted their guarantees to welcome the Congress. These guarantees include: completing planned targets ahead of schedule, increasing productivity, repairing equipment, saving, opening clubs, eliminating illiteracy, organizing training courses, nurseries, and children's summer camps. Some of these are impossible to calculate in money, but in terms of production guarantees, they have already exceeded 1.2 million zlotys (Polish currency). The most outstanding production guarantees have been put forward by metallurgical workers, smelting workers, coal miners, railway workers, textile workers, and sugar and food industry workers. Burski then talked about the grassroots link of the trade union movement – trade union member groups – which are being established in various industrial enterprises, with capable workers serving as group leaders. Burski expects these groups to make trade union activities more efficient, link the vast masses of trade union members with the trade union leadership, and make trade union organizations closer to the needs of trade union members. Mass rallies before the local congresses will begin next week. The representatives elected to participate in the Congress will actively participate in mass rallies so that they can submit all the problems and needs of their factories to the Congress. 1,800 representatives have been elected.

　　波工人竞赛增产迎接职工代表会
    【新华社北平十八日电】华沙讯：波兰职工会中央委员会代理主席布尔斯基向波兰通讯社记者谈即将举行的全国职工会代表大会的准备工作。布尔斯基说：我们的目的就是动员，我们所有三百五十万职工会会员去进一步增加生产，改善工人阶级的物质与文化条件和提高职工会会员的政治觉悟。全国已有一千六百余个工业企业与一百二十三个农场提出他们的保证来迎接代表大会。这些保证包括：提早完成计划目标，提高生产率，修理装备，节约，开设俱乐部，清除文盲，组织训练班、托儿所及儿童夏令营。内中有些是不可能以钱计算的，但在生产保证方面，他们已经超过一百二十万兹罗提（波币）。最特出的生产保证是由冶金工人、熔炼工人、采煤工人、铁路工人、纺织工人和制糖与食品工业工人提出的。布尔斯基接着谈到职工运动基层组织的环节——职工会会员小组，正在各工业企业中建立，由能干的工人担任组长。布尔斯基预期这些小组将使职工会活动更有效率，将把广大的职工会会员群众和职工会领导机构联系起来，并将使职工会机构更接近于职工会会员的需要。各地代表大会会前的群众大会将于下周开始。当选参加代表大会的代表们将积极的参加群众大会，以便能把他们工厂的全部问题和需要提交代表大会。一千八百名代表已选出。
