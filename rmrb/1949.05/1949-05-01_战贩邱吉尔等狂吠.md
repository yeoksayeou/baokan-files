    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th: London Dispatch: Notorious war-monger and leader of the British Conservative Party, Churchill, demanded in the British House of Commons on the 26th that the incident of British warships shelling the Yangtze River be used to expand aggression against China. Following British Prime Minister Attlee's report on the incident, Churchill spoke, demanding that the People's Liberation Army of China be dealt with in a "violent spirit." He demanded that the Labor government send one or two more aircraft carriers carrying bomber squadrons to the China Sea to carry out so-called "military retaliation." Another Conservative MP, Dowey, clamored that "there is no reason not to use aircraft equipped with rocket launchers" in the Yangtze River incident. A third Conservative MP, Head, demanded that immediate steps be taken to "ensure the use of air force cover." In the British House of Lords meeting held on the same day, Conservative Lords Swinton and Beatty also raved and barked for sending more aircraft and aircraft carriers to invade China. Churchill and his gang have completely exposed their hideous features of militaristic aggression. They thought that the Chinese people could be intimidated by rocket launchers, aircraft, and aircraft carriers. When Churchill spoke, even many Labor MPs shouted: "The Conservatives want war." However, the ruling Labor reactionary authorities have not yet shown any signs of repentance and are still implementing a policy of intimidation and provocation. Although Attlee admitted when reporting on the incident that the British government did indeed "know in advance that the Communist army would cross the river on April 21" and "became involved in fierce fighting" after invading the Yangtze River war zone, "destroying most of the opponent's (referring to the Chinese People's Liberation Army) artillery positions," he declared: "Britain will not apologize for its actions on the Yangtze River." On the same day that the British House of Commons discussed the British warship incident, according to a French Press Agency London dispatch: The British government has dispatched the cruiser "Jamaica" to China, and an aircraft carrier will also be sent in the near future.

    战贩邱吉尔等狂吠
    【新华社北平三十日电】伦敦讯：著名战贩英国保守党首领邱吉尔二十六日在英国下院要求借长江英舰炮击事件扩大侵略中国。邱吉尔在英首相艾德礼关于该事件的报告之后发言，要求以“强暴精神”对付中国人民解放军。他要求工党政府增派一两艘载有轰炸机队的航空母舰到中国海上来实行所谓“武力报复”。另一保守党议员道威叫嚣着，在长江事件中“没有利用装有火箭炮的飞机是没有道理的”。第三个保守党议员黑德要求立即采取步骤“保证利用空军掩护”。在同日举行的英上院会议中，保守党上议员斯瓦顿爵士及比蒂亦狂吠增派飞机及航空母舰侵略中国。邱吉尔及其一伙在这里完全暴露了他们的黩武侵略主义的狰狞面目。他们以为中国人民是可以用火箭炮、飞机、航空母舰吓倒的。当邱吉尔发言时，甚至许多工党议员也喊道：“保守党要战争。”但执政的工党反动当局亦尚无悔祸的表示，而且依然在执行恫吓和挑衅的政策。虽然艾德礼在报告事件的经过时承认英政府确已预先“获悉共军将于四月二十一日渡江”，并在侵入长江战区后“卷入猛烈的战斗中”，“击毁对方（指中国人民解放军）的多数炮位”，但他却声明：“英国将不为它在长江的行为道歉。”在英下院讨论英舰事件的同一天，据法新社伦敦电报道：英政府已派遣“牙买加”号巡洋舰来华，航空母舰亦将于短期内派来。
