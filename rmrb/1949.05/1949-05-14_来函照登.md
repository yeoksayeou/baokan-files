    Letters to the Editor
    To the People's Daily: Having read the news headline in the People's Daily of April 29th regarding the Washington order to all regions that "goods should not be subject to any additional taxes after the goods tax has been paid," according to the spirit of the aforementioned order, it means that goods that have already paid the goods tax upon leaving the factory should not be subject to a second goods tax. That is to say, after the goods tax has been paid, the goods should not be subject to any further goods taxes. However, the business tax for merchants and traders and the stamp tax on sales after the goods leave the factory and are resold should still be collected as usual. It would be clearer to change the aforementioned headline to "Taxable goods should not be subject to any further goods taxes after the goods tax has been paid," which would be easier for merchants and the public to understand. Therefore, we request that you provide an explanation. With best regards!
      Li Yuang, Director, and Wang Nanqiu, Deputy Director, of the North China Tax Bureau

    来函照登
    人民日报社：顷阅四月二十九日人民日报载有华府通令各地“货物照纳货物税后不得再征任何捐税”之新闻标题，按上项令文内容精神，系已纳货物税出厂之货物不再重征货物税。亦即是已纳货物税对该货不再重征任何货物捐税，其货物出厂转售后之座商及行商营业税及售卖之印花税等均仍照征。上项标题不若改为“应税货物照纳货物税后，不再重征任何货物捐税”比较明显，商民易于了解，为此函请予以解释为荷。此致敬礼！
