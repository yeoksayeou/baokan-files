    Random Notes on Entering Taiyuan
    Shēn Shù
    On the morning of April 24th, less than two hours after the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against Taiyuan City, red flags were planted everywhere on the city walls. With the waving of the victorious red flags, all PLA troops quickly broke through the city walls and advanced straight towards the city center. The people in the city excitedly forgot the danger of the artillery fire and ran out to see the PLA soldiers. When they saw the soldiers expelling and searching for the remaining enemies from bunkers, shelters, and all places like institutions, factories, and civilian houses, they couldn't help but point and say, "Our saviors have come!" While street fighting was still going on, the people of Taiyuan not only came out to welcome the PLA, but also boiled water and brought it to the street corners for the soldiers to drink. An elderly Hui Muslim man named Nà from Green Willow Street voluntarily came forward to guide the troops. When the soldiers completed their search mission and gathered on both sides of the street to rest, people gathered around and complained. Many people had already started cleaning and repairing their houses. The waterworks workers were already there connecting the water pipes that had been destroyed by artillery fire. Liú Dōnggān, a worker from the power plant, ran home from the factory that evening with the six catties of millet that had just been distributed. The news quickly spread throughout the courtyard, and the people cheered at the government's quick solution to the workers' living problems. Several workers from the chemical plant, who hadn't been to the factory for half a month, shouted, "We're going to work tomorrow. Now that the PLA has come, the factory is ours. What are we waiting for!"

    太原入城漫记
    申述
    四月二十四日上午，解放军对太原城发起总攻后不到两小时，城头各处插起了红旗，随着胜利红旗的招展，各路解放军都飞快的突破了城垣，直向市中心区挺进。城内人民兴奋的忘记了炮火危险，跑出来看解放军，当他们望见战士们从地堡里，掩护所里及机关、工厂、民房等一切地方驱逐着搜索着残敌时，就不由的指点着说：“救命恩人哪！可来啦！”巷战还在进行中，太原城内人民不仅出来欢迎解放军，并且还烧好了水，端到街口来给战士们喝。绿柳街一个姓那的老回民，自动走出来给部队带路。当战士们完成搜索任务集合在街道两旁休息的时候，人们就围拢上来，纷纷诉苦。许多人已经动手打扫和修补自己的家屋，自来水工人早已在那里接整被炮火炸毁的自来水管。发电厂工人刘东干，当天晚上从工厂跑回家来，提着刚发下来的六斤小米，这消息马上传遍了全院，人民政府这样快的解决工人的生活问题，引起人们的欢声；化学厂几个工人，已经半个月没什到工厂去了，他们嚷着说：“明天上工去，解放军一来工厂是自己的了。我们还等有么！”
