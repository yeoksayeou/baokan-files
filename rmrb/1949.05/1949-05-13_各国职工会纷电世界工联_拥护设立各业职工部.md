Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 11th: TASS Moscow dispatch: From Eastern Europe to Latin America, trade unions from various countries are sending telegrams in response to the World Federation of Trade Unions' declaration to establish industrial departments. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, Erban, stated: The Czechoslovak Trade Union is deeply satisfied to hear that the International Conference for the Establishment of Industrial Departments is about to be convened. We believe that the establishment of industrial departments is proof of the further consolidation of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Vice-Chairman of the Albanian General Trade Union, Pistirillo, stated: The establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions' industrial departments marks a major victory for workers worldwide. This is a blow to the capitalist lackeys in the central organs of trade unions in the United States, Britain, and other countries. The First Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation of Greater Berlin, Dieter, after pointing out the importance of the industrial departments about to be established, said: Ensuring the participation of representatives from the national trade unions of various industries in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany in the industrial conferences to be held in June is one of our most important tasks. We believe that some trade union organizations in the Western-occupied zones will overcome the obstruction of reactionary leading organs and will also send their representatives to attend these conferences. The Chairman of the Venezuelan Mixed Oil Workers' Union, Faria, stated: Venezuelan workers in metal, sewing, leather, and other industries are determined to send representatives to the founding conferences of their respective industrial departments.
