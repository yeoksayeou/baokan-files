Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: A front-line reporter reports on the liberation of Xinxiang and Anyang, stating: Xinxiang and Anyang, liberated successively on the 5th and 6th, were the last two remaining enemy strongholds within the jurisdiction of the North China Liberated Area. Xinxiang is located at the intersection of the Pinghan and Daoqing Railways and is a military stronghold north of the Yellow River. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang bandit army used this place as a springboard and supply base for attacking our North China Liberated Area. After the successive liberation of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, and Huixian along the Daoqing line last winter and this spring, the remnants of the enemy's 40th Army, along with local bandits from northern Henan, shrank into the city, attempting to prolong their lives and wait for an opportunity to break through. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping in February, the enemy plotted to destroy Xinxiang's urban buildings and blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge, and then escape south by air. In late February, they first airlifted more than 400 of their cadres away. The People's Liberation Army outside the city quickly controlled the city's western airport with combat maneuvers on the night of March 10th, cutting off their escape route. On May 1st, a unit of the People's Liberation Army surrounded Xinxiang. However, in order to protect the lives and property of the people in the city from artillery fire, the unit, following the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, ordered the defending enemy to immediately cease their futile resistance and surrender to the People's Liberation Army. Under the powerful influence of the People's Liberation Army, the defending enemy sent representatives on May 3rd to request a peaceful resolution. On the afternoon of May 5th, representatives from both sides signed an agreement in Chenbao Town, west of the city, and all of the defending enemy, more than 10,000 people, were sent out of the city to await reorganization. On the 6th, the People's Liberation Army entered the city walls. Thus, Xinxiang, the largest isolated stronghold of the enemy in northern Henan, was liberated.

The People's Liberation Army's attack on the defending enemy in Anyang began in late April. On April 28th, the People's Liberation Army completely cleared the outer strongholds of Anyang and controlled the four gates of Anyang. At that time, the People's Liberation Army repeatedly ordered the bandit leaders in Anyang to surrender to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. However, relying on the solid city defense works built over the years, the enemy believed that they were "impregnable and could hold out for three months" and refused to surrender. In order to carry out Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to resolutely annihilate all Kuomintang bandit troops who dared to resist, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive at 5:30 a.m. on May 6th, using fierce artillery fire to destroy the enemy's scattered pillboxes and fortifications. In just fifteen minutes, three assault teams crossed two moats more than two yards wide and dense layers of bunkers, and broke into the city in one fell swoop. Subsequent troops poured into the city like an overwhelming force. The defending bandit army quickly collapsed and surrendered one after another. By 7:00 a.m., the battle was over, and all the bandits who had occupied Anyang for more than ten years were annihilated, with no one escaping. Guo Qing, the deputy commander of the pseudo-Ji-Yu Border Region Cleansing Command, was killed in action. Zhao Zhichen, the commander of the pseudo-Ji-Yu Border Region Cleansing Command, Wu Jinren, the head of the Kuomintang military intelligence, and Wang Jingchang, the brigade commander of the pseudo-Henan Security Second Brigade, and Liu Leiren, the brigade commander of the Third Brigade, were captured alive. The 100,000 citizens of Anyang warmly welcomed the entry of the People's Liberation Army into the city with unparalleled joy. They quickly demolished the doors and windows built of bricks to prevent the bandit army from looting, saying: From now on, no bandits will come to rob us again!

    豫北前线记者报导
    新乡安阳解放经过
    【新华社北平十三日电】前线记者报道新乡安阳解放的经过称：五、六两日先后解放的新乡和安阳是华北解放区辖境内敌人最后两个残余据点。新乡位于平汉、道清两铁路的交叉点上，为黄河以北的军事要地。日本投降后，国民党匪军即以此地作为进攻我华北解放区的跳板与兵站基地。在去冬今春开封、郑州、徐州及道清沿线的焦作、修武、辉县相继解放后，敌四十军残部兴豫北地方土匪，即龟缩城内，企图苟延残喘，待机突围。二月间平津解放后，该敌又阴谋破坏新乡城市建筑、炸毁黄河大铁桥，然后空运南逃。二月下旬，曾首先空运其四百余干部逃走。城外人民解放军乃于三月十日夜迅速以战斗动作控制城西飞机场，断其逃路。五月一日，解放军某部把新乡团团围住。但为保全全城人民生命财产免遭炮火损害，该部遵从毛主席朱总司令的命令，下令守敌迅速停止无谓的抵抗，向解放军投降。守敌在解放军强大声威下，乃于五月三日派出代表请求和平解决。五月五日下午双方代表在城西陈堡镇举行签字，守敌全部一万余人全部开出城外，听候改编。六日解放军进驻城垣。至此豫北敌人最大孤立据点新乡乃告解放。
    解放军对安阳守敌的进击开始于四月底。四月二十八日解放军即全部肃清安阳外围据点，控制安阳四关。当时，解放军曾数次命令安阳匪首投降，免作无谓牺牲。但该敌凭借数年来建成的坚固城防工事，自以为“固若金汤，保管能守三个月”，而拒绝投降。解放军为执行毛主席、朱总司令的坚决歼灭一切敢于顽抗的国民党匪军的命令，乃于五月六日晨五时半发起总攻，用猛烈炮火轰毁敌星罗棋布的碉堡工事，仅十五分钟，三支突击部队即越过两道宽达两丈多的护城壕和密密层层的地堡群，一举突入城内。后续部队随即排山倒海地涌进城去。守城匪军迅即土崩瓦解，纷纷举手投降。至七时，结束战斗，盘据安阳十余年之贯匪悉数就歼，无一漏网。匪首伪冀豫边区清巢副指挥官郭清被击毙，伪冀豫边区清巢指挥官赵质宸，军统特务头子武尽仁及伪河南保安第二旅旅长王景昌、第三旅旅长刘乐仁等则被生擒。安阳十万市民以无比欢欣的心情热烈欢迎解放军进城，他们迅速拆毁因防匪军抢劫而用砖头垒起的门窗说：从此再也没有土匪来抢了！
