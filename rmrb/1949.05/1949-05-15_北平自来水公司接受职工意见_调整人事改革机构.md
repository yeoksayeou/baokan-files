    Beiping Water Company Accepts Employee Opinions and Adjusts Personnel Reform Organization
    [This Newspaper] Beiping City Water Company, based on the opinions of all employees and various sectors, has completed its institutional reform and personnel adjustments. After deciding to reform the institution and adjust personnel, the company convened a staff meeting of more than 260 people on the 10th, and everyone submitted their opinions on the reform and adjustment. After summarizing, more than 50 people should leave their posts, and some employees voluntarily proposed to leave or study. In the cooperative, 44 people suggested that Zuo Yinghan should leave because he had no working ability, was corrupt, beat workers, and relied on his influence to get by. Gong Desan, who had nothing to do all day, should also leave. Men Guanru, a clerk in the business office, had no working ability but a very high salary, and 22 people suggested that he should leave. Some workers also suggested that the company should have carried out institutional and personnel adjustments long ago. The company immediately conducted careful research based on everyone's opinions and each person's usual work performance, and implemented the adjustments with the approval of the Enterprise Bureau. After the company was taken over by the municipal government, it sent 11 Kuomintang secret agents away for training, and dismissed 20 others who had joined the factory through speculation. This time, based on the company's actual needs and the opinions of all employees, it was decided that 61 people, including Zuo Yinghan, Shang Zhiping, and Nie Yuru, should leave their posts, and decisions were made regarding their reassignments, studies, or returns home based on their individual opinions. The handling of the 15 members of the board of directors is still under consideration. The large organization of the original five departments, fourteen sections, and thirteen units has also been reduced as needed. These decisions were announced at the staff meeting held yesterday (the 14th). Director Jia of the Enterprise Bureau also attended and delivered a speech. After explaining the significance of this adjustment, he called on the staff remaining at the factory to work hard to produce and take on the task of supplying water to the city.
