　　More Than 4,000 Volumes of Famous Scriptures Arrive in Ping City
    During the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Bo Yibo personally directed and protected this precious heritage, and eight soldiers paid the ultimate price for it.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Zhao City Guang Sheng Temple Sutra Collection in Shanxi is the only existing Jin Dynasty engraved scripture in the country, and it is of great value in cultural history. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders attempted to loot this collection. Because the old monks in the temple had a strong sense of national consciousness, they secretly sent a letter to the Eighth Route Army guerrilla team. At that time, the leader of the Party was Comrade Bo Yibo, the current Secretary of the North China Bureau. After receiving this report, he decided to rescue this only remaining cultural heritage. He then sent troops to fight the Japanese invaders, and eight soldiers sacrificed their lives, finally rescuing the scripture collection. He also designated Comrade Niu Peicong, the current Director of the Taiyue Administrative Office, and another comrade to be responsible for its safekeeping. They secretly hid it in a coal mine, and only the two of them knew the location. They would check it once a year and report to their superiors. After the victory, Comrade Bo Yibo handed the scripture over to Northern University for safekeeping. President Fan Wenlan appointed Comrade Zhang Wenjiao to be responsible for its management. Comrade Zhang worked extremely hard and responsibly to save public funds, and became so exhausted that he vomited blood. After the liberation of Beiping, with the approval of Comrade Yibo, it was handed over to the People's Beiping Library for preservation. The North China Government telegraphed the Taihang Administrative Office to be responsible for its transportation. It arrived in Beiping on April 30th and was immediately handed over to the Beiping Library. After preliminary sorting by the rare book room, there were a total of 4,330 volumes and nine large packages. The library held a symposium on May 14th, attended by Yang Xiufeng, Chao Zhefu, Sun Wenshu, Yu Li, Fan Wenlan, Ma Heng, Xiang Da, Zhou Shujia, Ju Zan, Han Shouxuan, Ji Xianlin, Wang Chongmin, Zhao Wanli, Zhang Wenjiao, Cheng Deqing, Wang Yeqiu, and others. Zhao Wanli reported on the origin and value of the scripture, Zhang Wenjiao reported on the difficult guarding and transportation process, and Fan Wenlan reported that the Communist Party attaches importance to cultural heritage and uses various methods to protect it under extremely difficult conditions, even sacrificing the lives of our soldiers. He also said that in the future, the study of ancient culture should be approached with the spirit of "using the present to understand the past" for critical acceptance. Monk Ju Zan wanted to mobilize Buddhists to donate paper for mounting. Yu Li said that the government would send the scripture to the Beiping Library for preservation. He also said that Mr. He Kongcai donated his family collection, and that similar events from both public and private sectors would follow one after another, making our library a collection of books for the public to consult and read. Chao Zhefu asked the Beiping Library to make a budget so that the government could consider renovation. Xiang Da concluded by saying that the Kuomintang secret agents used to spread rumors that the Communist Party did not want culture, but the rescue and protection of this scripture collection is the best answer. At the meeting, everyone hoped that the details of the process would be written and published by the parties involved and the researchers.

　　名经四千余卷运抵平市
    薄一波同志在抗战艰苦的岁月里，亲自指挥卫护此珍贵遗产，  八位战士为此付出了生命代价。
    【本报讯】山西赵城广胜寺藏经为国内仅有的金刻经卷，在文化史上极有价值。抗日期间，日寇曾企图抢劫这部经卷。由于寺内老僧民族意识很强，即向八路军游击队秘密送信，当时党的领导人就是现在华北局书记薄一波同志，接到这个报告后，即决定抢救这部仅存的文化遗产。遂派了队伍去同日寇打仗，还牺牲了八位战士的生命，终于把这部经卷抢救出来。并指定由现任太岳行署主任的牛佩琮同志和另一同志负责保管，他们很秘密地把它藏在一座煤洞里，只有他两位知道处所。每年去检查一次，向上级作报告。胜利后，薄一波同志即把此经交给北方大学保管。范文澜校长派张文教同志负责管理。张同志曾为节约公款，极艰苦负责的去工作，而累得吐了血。北平解放后，经一波同志批准，交与人民的北平图书馆保藏，由华北政府电太行行署负责运送。于四月三十日到达北平，当即交与北平图书馆。经过善本室的初步整理，共有四千三百三十卷又九大包。该馆特于五月十四日举行座谈会，出席者有杨秀峰、晁哲甫、孙文淑、于力、范文澜、马衡、向达、周叔迦、巨赞、韩寿萱、季羡林、王重民、赵万里、张文教、程德清、王冶秋等，由赵万里报告此经的源流和价值，张文教报告艰苦守护及运送经过，范文澜报告共产党重视文化遗产，在极艰苦的条件下，用各种方法来保护，甚至牺牲我们战士的生命。并对于今后研究古代文化，应以“好今以及古”的精神去批判接受。巨赞和尚要发动佛教徒捐献装裱的纸张。于力说政府将此经送存北平图书馆。他又说，贺孔才先生捐了他的家藏，以后公私两方这类事将接踵而至，使我们的图书馆成为图书汇集所，可以供大众来参考阅读。晁哲甫要北平图书馆方面作出预算来，以便政府考虑装修。向达最后说，从前国民党特务造谣说共产党不要文化，这部经卷的抢救保护，就是最好的回答。会上大家都希望把经过情形，由各当事人及考证者写出印行。
