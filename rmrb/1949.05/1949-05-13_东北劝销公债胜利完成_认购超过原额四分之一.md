    Northeast's Public Bond Promotion Successfully Completed
    Subscription Exceeds Original Amount by One-Quarter
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The Northeast region's promotion of the first phase of the 38th year Production and Construction Commodity Prize Bonds has been completed, with subscriptions exceeding the original issuance amount by one-quarter. After the Northeast Administrative Committee issued regulations for promoting public bonds on March 15th, various cities successively established public bond promotion committees at the end of March, starting active promotion to people from all walks of life. Incomplete statistics for the one month ending April 30th show that the total subscription in Northeast China reached 7.5 million shares (each share valued at approximately 90,000 Northeast currency units, totaling 675 billion units), exceeding the original issuance amount of 6 million shares by one-quarter. Payment has also reached more than two-thirds. As of April 30th, a total of more than 5.19 million shares of public bond funds have been received from various locations, totaling 467.96 billion units. The enthusiastic subscription of public bonds by the people of Northeast China fully reflects their enthusiasm for developing production and construction and supporting the national liberation war. Currently, except for Liaoning Province, where the promotion work started later, all regions will complete this work by the middle of this month. In this issuance, the subscription volume from large cities was high; for example, Shenyang City subscribed for 2.5 million shares, followed by Harbin City, which also subscribed for 1.8 million shares; Changchun City had sold 140,000 shares as of the 27th of last month. All three cities exceeded the planned amount.

    东北劝销公债胜利完成
    认购超过原额四分之一
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北地区三十八年度上期生产建设实物有奖公债的劝销工作已经完成，认购数目超过了原定发行数的四分之一。东北行政委员会自三月十五日发布推销公债的条例后，各城市于三月底相继成立了公债劝销委员会，开始向各界人民积极推销。至四月三十日一个月中的不完全统计，全东北认购量已达七百五十万分（每分之值约东北币九万元，合计六千七百五十亿元），超过本期公债原定发行量六百万分的四分之一。交款亦已达三分之二以上。至四月三十日止，各地共收到公债款五百十九万余分，共计四千六百七十九亿六十余万元。东北人民的踊跃认购公债，充分反映出他们对发展生产建设和支援全国解放战争的热情。现除辽宁省因劝销工作进行较迟外，各地将于本月中旬全部完成这一工作。此次发行的公债以大城市认购数为多，如沈阳市即认购了二百五十万分，其次为哈尔滨市，也认购了一百八十万分；长春市截至上月二十七日，已售出公债十四万分。上述三地匀超过了预定数。
