Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. The Shanghai Liberation Daily was launched on the 28th, with an inaugural editorial entitled "Celebrating the Liberation of Great Shanghai," the full text of which is as follows:

　　On May 25, 1949, following the liberation of major cities such as Nanjing, Taiyuan, Wuhan, and Xi'an, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with its ever-victorious hand, unveiled the liberation of Great Shanghai. Under the shroud of the aforementioned series of great victories, the demise of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the great liberation of the Chinese people are beyond doubt. In the future, the advance into the Southwest will completely eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang without any serious battles. The development of the People's Liberation War to the liberation of Great Shanghai is a great historical event in the mid-20th century that has shaken the world and all mankind. In the centuries to come, the great Chinese people will use their wisdom and labor to build an independent, free, and prosperous New China, and to advance the cause of peace and democracy throughout the world. On the day of the liberation of Great Shanghai, standing at this turning point in Chinese history, we should celebrate, rejoice, and hold our heads high. Look! The history of an old China that has been invaded and damaged has come to an end; the history of an independent and free New China has begun. History has proven how magnificent and strong the revolutionary creativity of the Chinese people is. History has also proven how insignificant and fragile the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is. The direction of human history is always cruel and ruthless to all reactionaries. It always sweeps away darkness and creates light according to the will and desire of the people. It always goes against the will and desire of all reactionary groups, sending them into the graves they have dug themselves. This is the general law of the movement of human history. The liberation of the Chinese people, marked by the liberation of Great Shanghai, like the triumph of all great revolutions in history, once again powerfully points out that this truth is worthy of being solemnly proclaimed and deeply savored in the joyous celebration of the liberation of Great Shanghai.

　　The Chinese people will never forget that Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit gang once妄想[妄想: vainly attempt] to resist in Great Shanghai for six months or even a year, and attempted to destroy the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people in Great Shanghai, seeking miracles to save the demise of their reactionary rule. In order to achieve this goal, Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit gang massacred communists in large numbers, massacred revolutionary workers and students in large numbers, repeatedly arrested and kidnapped democrats from all walks of life, undermined democratic parties, extorted gold from all citizens, plundered materials, and arbitrarily destroyed the industrial, cultural institutions, and people's residences of Shanghai, along with the vast countryside in the suburbs, arbitrarily burned them, thinking that in this way, they could resist the People's Liberation Army's attack, and before their demise, use a destroyed Shanghai to offset the glorious victory of the Chinese people. Their barbarity, viciousness, shamelessness, and their transformation from despair to madness really broke the record of all human enemies in history. However, contrary to their wishes, as soon as the People's Liberation Army issued the general offensive order, the resistance of Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit gang was completely crushed in a few days of fighting. The bandits either fled in panic or obediently became prisoners of the people. The Chinese people must not forgive the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in destroying Great Shanghai, and will pursue these war criminals to the ends of the earth. No matter how vast the world is, they will eventually not escape the judgment of the people's court. At the same time, more importantly, the Chinese people will never be discouraged. Comrade Mao Zedong said: The Chinese people are brave and hardworking. They will never allow the reactionaries to have any joy. They are determined to work hard to build a great people's New Shanghai to answer the destruction of Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit gang.

　　Shanghai is a city where China's economy and industry are concentrated. It is a port for China's internal and external trade. It is a hotbed of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudal forces. It is a gathering place for China's revolutionary youth and progressive cultural movements, and thus also the source of China's revolutionary movement for decades. Looking back at the modern history of the Chinese revolution, every revolutionary movement is directly related to the city of Shanghai. From the May Fourth Movement, the May Thirtieth Movement, the Northern Expedition, the Ten-Year Land Revolution, the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan to the People's Liberation War that has won victory today, the working class of Great Shanghai, the revolutionary youth of Great Shanghai, the progressive cultural circles and industrial circles of Great Shanghai, and the broad revolutionary citizens of Great Shanghai have all contributed their efforts. Today, the liberation of Great Shanghai is to declare the demise of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the representatives of evil forces in China. However, this is only the destruction and expulsion of reactionary political institutions, reactionary armed forces, and reactionary secret service agencies. The political, economic, and cultural old forces created by American imperialism and Chinese reactionary forces in Shanghai for nearly a century, and the various evil systems and habits that exploit the people, these forces against the Chinese people are still powerful. They are unwilling to yield, they want to continue to struggle, and they want to continue to fight against the people. Understanding this point, the million workers, 500,000 young students and cultural circles, industrial circles, various democratic parties and democratic people from all walks of life, and all citizens of Shanghai will understand that they must tightly grasp the victory of the liberation of Great Shanghai and immediately turn to the continued battle. The victory of the Chinese revolution to this day is only the first step in the Long March. The road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous. We must not be complacent or arrogant, but must make a hundred times more effort to build a new Shanghai for the people on the basis of being severely damaged and ravaged by the enemy. We call on all citizens to immediately line up, immediately take action, and start working under the great slogan of building a new Shanghai.

　　Our first major task is to completely destroy the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We should not allow any stubborn reactionaries to continue their activities. Our policy is lenient, but our leniency is for those who are willing to turn over a new leaf. We hope that they will quickly wake up, embrace the light, and return to the embrace of the Chinese people, and no longer迷误[迷误: be confused]. Those war criminals and reactionary henchmen who are reactionary to the end must not be given the slightest leniency and must be thoroughly annihilated.

　　Our second major task is to pool our efforts to protect the democratic freedom of all Shanghai citizens. People who have been oppressed, ravaged, and have no freedom to speak of for many years, once they have obtained freedom and democracy through their own efforts, only they will know the most precious thing about democratic freedom, and only they will know that revolutionary order is the sharpest weapon to protect the people's democratic freedom. We must quickly establish various revolutionary mass organizations, under the leadership of the People's Government, use the political awareness and organizational strength of the masses themselves to protect the interests of the masses themselves, to establish revolutionary order, and to eliminate the remaining enemies. This is our second major project to build a new Shanghai.

　　Our third major task is to smoothly complete the takeover and quickly restore production. The party, government, and military organs of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Shanghai must be taken over immediately. We call on the old staff in various organs not to be alarmed, to stay in their original positions, obey the orders of the Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army and the military representatives it sends, and quickly complete the work of inventory and handover, and obey all orders. No destruction is allowed. As long as you are aware and obey the laws and decrees of the People's Government, the People's Government will definitely protect you, care about your future, and give you the opportunity to serve the people. In the restoration of production, we will follow the basic policy of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. Only by enabling all public and private enterprises in Shanghai to recover quickly and operate normally can a truly revolutionary order be established. Yes, the abolition of the evil system of the old society is imminent, but this abolition work should have time to make thorough preparations. To sweep away the dirt accumulated by the old society for decades in one morning on the day of the liberation of Shanghai is not only impossible, but will cause chaos and put the people themselves at a disadvantage. Since our people have power in their hands, and since we have the highest vigilance to prevent counter-revolutionary forces from restoring, we can grasp all the initiative and gradually eliminate all the filth of the old society. We must not be impatient, we must not lose confidence. Only by restoring production, only by increasing production, only by enabling various public and private production enterprises to restore and exert their activity can Great Shanghai embark on the right track of construction.

　　In the execution of the above three major tasks of eliminating the remaining enemies, protecting the people's democratic freedom, completing the takeover, and restoring production, we solemnly propose that all revolutionary people need to give play to their own political consciousness and maintain a high degree of discipline and organization. This is the key to determining the problem. Because the enemy's political and military forces have been defeated, but the enemy is cunning, they are very experienced in carrying out counter-revolution, they know how to disguise democratic faces, they know how to carry out secret sabotage work, they know how to use leftist rhetoric or spread rumors and lies to fool people in the revolutionary camp who are not highly aware, and they know how to find the weaknesses in the revolutionary camp, take advantage of the gaps to attack, and carry out various sabotage. Therefore, we need our people to be good at identifying the true and false, distinguishing right from wrong, remember to tighten the camp, unify the pace, abide by strict discipline, value and obey the regulations of various organizations, so that all saboteurs and lurking elements have no possibility of activity. We believe that the working class of Great Shanghai, the broad revolutionary youth, the progressive cultural circles, industrial circles, and all revolutionary citizens, they have many years of revolutionary experience, and are good at fighting against the enemy in various places. Today's masters of the country must be good at organizing themselves, training themselves, creating close unity, and maintaining solid discipline to complete the complex and difficult task of building a new Shanghai.

　　We Chinese Communists, whether in the scope of the whole of China or in the scope of the whole of Shanghai, we have been fighting alongside the people of China for many years, and we have been fighting alongside the people of Shanghai for many years. This is the case in the period of revolutionary development and advancement, and it is also the case when the revolution fails and faces extreme difficulties. The Chinese Communist Party is a revolutionary group of the Chinese people. Under the support of the Chinese people and the people of Shanghai for many years, it has led the people of the country and has won today's complete victory. We Chinese Communists are determined to continue the tradition of maintaining close ties with the people in the past, and are willing to work with the working class, other laborers, revolutionary intellectuals, and the liberal bourgeoisie of Shanghai, based on all the established policies of the Chinese Communist Party, to fulfill their responsibilities as the vanguard of the people. From today onwards, we will publish the Liberation Daily in Shanghai, use its pages to express our views, and make various suggestions to the people of Shanghai. We are willing to absorb the correct opinions of people from all walks of life with a humble spirit of learning, as the basis for us to formulate policies and lead the construction of Great Shanghai. We sincerely ask all revolutionary citizens of Great Shanghai to unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, and strive for the victory of building a new China and a new Shanghai.

　　上海解放日报发刊词
  　号召沪市人民完成三大任务
    【新华社上海三十日电】上海解放日报二十八日创刊，发刊词题为“庆祝大上海的解放”，全文如下：
    一九四九年五月二十五日，继南京、太原、武汉、西安诸大名城解放之后，我中国人民解放军，又用他的常胜之手，揭开了大上海解放之幕。在这上述一连串的伟大胜利的笼罩下，国民党反动统治的灭亡，中国人民的大翻身，已毫无疑义。此后进军西南，用不着什么严重战斗就可以完全消灭国民党的残余。人民解放战争发展到大上海的解放，这乃是二十世纪中叶震动全世界全人类的伟大历史事件。在今后的世纪中，伟大的中国人民将以他的智慧和劳动来建设独立的、自由的、繁荣的新中国，来推进全世界的和平民主事业。我们当着大上海解放的日子，站在这中国历史转变关头，我们应该庆祝，应该快乐，应该扬眉吐气。看吧！一个被侵略被损害的古旧的中国的历史，已经完结；一个独立的、自由的新中国的历史，已经开端。历史证明了，中国人民的革命创造力，是多么雄伟，多么坚强。历史又证明了，蒋介石匪帮是多么渺小，多么脆弱。人类历史的发展方向，总是对一切反动派残酷无情的。它总是按照人民的意志和愿望，扫荡黑暗和创造光明。它总是违背一切反动集团的意志和愿望，送他们走进他们自己挖好的坟墓。这就是人类历史运动的总规律。以大上海之解放为标志的中国人民的翻身，正如历史上所有的大革命的凯旋一样，最有力的再一次指明，这个真理是值得我们在庆祝大上海解放的欢乐声中，来郑重传扬，来深切回味的。
    中国人民永远不会忘记，蒋介石及其匪帮曾妄想在大上海作六个月甚至一年的抵抗，曾企图毁灭大上海中外人民的生命财产，寻求奇迹来挽救其反动统治的灭亡。蒋介石及其匪帮为了达到此目的，大批屠杀共产党员，大批屠杀革命的工人和学生，迭次逮捕和绑架各阶层的民主人士，摧残民主党派，向所有市民勒索黄金，搜刮物资，把上海市的产业文化机关、人民住宅，连同近郊广大乡村，任意平毁，任意焚烧，满以为如此这般，可以抵抗人民解放军的进攻，可以在他灭亡之前，以一个毁灭的上海，来抵销中国人民的光荣胜利，其野蛮恶毒，其恶劣无耻，其由绝望到顶点而转化为疯狂，实在突破历史上所有人类公敌的纪录。然而事与愿违，而我人民解放军总攻令下，不消几天的战斗，蒋介石及其匪帮的抵抗便完全粉碎。匪帮们不是抱头鼠窜，便是乖乖的变为人民的俘虏。中国人民绝不能宽恕蒋介石匪帮破坏大上海的罪行，必将追寻这些战犯到海角天涯，无论世界范围是多么广阔，他们终有一天逃不脱人民法庭的判决。同时更重要的，是中国人民永不会灰心丧气。毛泽东同志说：中国人民是勇敢而勤劳的，它决不让反动派有任何欢乐，它决心努力建设一个伟大的人民的新上海，来回答蒋介石及其匪帮的破坏。
    上海是中国经济和产业集中的都市，是中国内外贸易的吞吐港，是帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建势力的窝巢，是中国革命青年和进步的文化运动的聚集所，从而也是几十年中国革命运动的策源地。翻开近代中国革命史，每一次革命运动都与上海这个城市有直接的关联。从五四运动、五卅运动、北伐战争、十年土地革命、八年抗日战争到今天已获胜利的人民解放战争，大上海的工人阶级、大上海的革命青年、大上海的进步的文化界和产业界，和大上海广大的革命市民们，每一次都贡献了他们的努力。今天大上海的解放，是宣告中国恶势力的代表国民党反动派的灭亡。但这仅是反动的政治机构、反动派的武装力量、反动派的特务机构等的被摧毁和被驱逐。美帝国主义与中国反动势力近百年在上海所造成的政治经济的、文化的旧势力，剥削人民的各种恶制度、恶习惯，这些反对中国人民的势力是仍然强大的。他们是不甘屈服的，他们要继续挣扎，要继续向人民作战。明白这一点，我们上海百万的工人阶级，五十万的青年学生及文化界、产业界、各民主党派和各阶层民主人士及一切市民们，方会懂得紧握着大上海解放这一胜利，立即转入继续的战斗。中国革命的进程到今天为止的胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步，革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大、更艰苦。我们不要自满，不要骄傲，而要百倍的努力，在被敌人破坏和蹂躏得很厉害的基础之上，去努力建设人民的新上海。我们号召全体市民们，在建设新上海的伟大口号之下，立即站队，立即动手，开始工作。
    我们第一个大任务，是彻底摧毁国民党反动派的残余。应该不让一切怙恶不悛的反动分子有继续活动的余地。我们的政策是宽大的，但是我们的宽大是对愿意自新的人而言，希望他们迅速觉悟，迎接光明，回到中国人民的怀抱，不要再自迷误。对那些反动到底的战争罪犯和反动爪牙，则不能有丝毫宽假，必须予以彻底的歼灭。
    我们的第二大任务，是群策群力，来保护全上海市民的民主自由。多年受压迫、受蹂躏、无丝毫自由可言的人民，一旦以自己的努力获得了自由民主，则只有他们才知道民主自由之最可宝爱，则只有他们知道革命秩序便是保护人民的民主自由的最锐利武器。我们要迅速建立各种革命的群众团体，在人民政府领导之下，以群众自己的政治觉悟和组织力量去保护群众自己的利益，去建立革命秩序，肃清残余敌人。这是我们建设新上海的第二个大工程。
    我们第三个大任务，便是顺利完成接管，迅速恢复生产。对国民党反动派在上海的党政军机关，必须立即接管。我们号召在各机关的旧人员们，不要惊扰，各在原职位上，服从人民解放军军事管制委员会及其派出的军事代表的命令，迅速完成清点移交等工作，一切听命处理，不准许有任何破坏。只要你们有觉悟并服从人民政府的法令，人民政府定加意保护你们，关心你们的前途，使你们有服务人民的机会。在恢复生产事业上，是按照发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的基本方计去办。只有使全上海的公私企业能迅速恢复，能正常进行，才能建立真正的革命秩序。是的，旧社会的恶制度的废除是迫不及待的，但是这一废除工作，应该有时间去作周密的准备。想在解放上海的一天的一个早上，把几十年来旧社会所铸成的污秽一下扫清，这不仅是不可能的，反而会造成紊乱，使人民自己处于不利地位。我们人民既然权力在握，既然有最高警惕不让反革命势力有复辟余地，则我们就能掌握一切主动，把一切旧社会污秽陆续地加以消灭。我们不要性急，我们不要丧失信心。只有恢复生产，只有提高生产，只有使各种公营私营的生产事业能恢复、能发挥其活动能力，才能使大上海走入建设的正轨。
    在上述肃清残敌、保护人民的民主自由、完成接管到恢复生产三大任务之执行中，我们郑重提出，需要全体革命人民发挥自己的政治自觉，保持高度的纪律性和组织性，这是决定问题的关键。因为敌人的政治军事势力是被打败了，但敌人是狡猾的，他们作反革命是很有经验的，他们懂得伪装民主的面孔，懂得作秘密破坏工作，懂得利用左倾词句或造谣说谎来愚弄革命阵营中觉悟程度不高的人，他们更懂得寻找革命阵营中的弱点，乘隙进攻，来作各种破坏。因此，就需要我们人民善于识别真伪，分清是非，要记住紧札阵营，统一步调，遵守严格的纪律，看重和服从各种组织的规定，这样便使一切破坏分子、潜伏分子无活动的可能。我们相信，大上海的工人阶级，广大的革命青年，进步的文化界、产业界及一切革命市民们，他们有多年的革命锻炼，在各种场所，均善于与敌人斗争。今天的国家主人翁必能善于组织自己，训练自己，造成亲密团结，保持巩固的纪律，去完成复杂而艰难的建设新上海的任务。
    我们中国共产党人，无论就全中国范围来说，无论就全上海的范围来说，我们多年来都与全中国人民在一道进行斗争，多年都与全上海人民在一道进行斗争。在革命发展前进时期，是如此，当革命失败困难到万分的时期，亦是如此。中国共产党是中国人民革命集团，他多年来在中国人民与上海人民的支援之下，领导全国人民，获得了今天的完满的胜利。我们中国共产党人，有决心仍然继续过去与人民密切联系的传统，愿意与上海的工人阶级、其他劳动者、革命知识分子及自由资产阶级一道，本着中国共产党既定的全部政策，履行其为人民先锋队的职责，从今天起，在上海刊行解放日报，用它的篇幅来发表自己的主张，向上海人民作各种建议。我们愿意以虚心请教的精神，吸收各阶层人民的正确意见，作为我们制订政策、领导大上海建设的根据，诚恳要求大上海一切革命市民们，在中国共产党和中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东的领导之下，团结起来，争取建设新中国、新上海的胜利。
