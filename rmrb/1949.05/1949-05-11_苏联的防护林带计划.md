    The Soviet Shelterbelt Project

    The Soviet Union is the country with the most abundant forest resources in the world. About a quarter of the world's valuable timber is in the Soviet Union, and the vast Siberian region is covered by boundless "black pine forests." However, socialist Soviet Union is by no means satisfied with its natural advantages. It is actively engaged in afforestation with a world-shocking spirit to further conquer disasters and ensure bumper harvests every year. The most important part of the Soviet afforestation plan was promulgated on October 20, 1948. In order to correct the errors of nature, a "Plan for Creating Forest Shelterbelts, Implementing Crop and Pasture Rotation Systems, Building Ponds and Reservoirs, and Ensuring Bumper Harvests Every Year in the Steppe and Forest-Steppe Zones of the European Part of the Soviet Union" was created. The steppe and forest-steppe zones of the European part of the Soviet Union were originally vast and fertile agricultural areas and important granaries of the Soviet Union. However, this area is hit by hot winds from the Central Asian desert, and droughts occur about once every three years, causing considerable damage to agriculture. The people in the Tsarist era met the drought with suffering; but today, the socialist Soviet Union will never allow nature to be so rampant. After dedicated research by scientists, the Soviet Council of Ministers and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) finally formulated a great plan to create shelterbelts, change nature, and eliminate disasters based on Stalin's proposal.

    The plan stipulates that eight major state-owned forest shelterbelts will be created within fifteen years. The first and longest one will extend from the Ural Mountains to the Caspian Sea, with a length of 1,080 kilometers and a width of one kilometer (divided into six rows of planting, with a spacing of 200 meters between each row); the second one will be planted along both banks of the Volga River, with a length of 900 kilometers; the remaining six will also be planted along other rivers. The total length of these eight shelterbelts is 5,320 kilometers, and the total area is 117,900 hectares.

    The plan also stipulates that state farms and collective farms in this area should systematically plant a total area of 5.7009 million hectares of protective forests around farmland, on the slopes of ravines and valleys, along the shores of lakes, and around ponds and reservoirs within fifteen years.

    The words and deeds of socialist countries and the Bolshevik Party are always consistent. After the plan was promulgated, 20,000 afforestation teams have been organized in this area, of which 760 team leaders have received specialized scientific training, and agricultural schools have immediately begun to train 7,200 forest improvement talents. A large number of experts from the Academy of Sciences and a large number of the latest machines have been organized into the afforestation plan. A Central Committee for Planting Forest Shelterbelts was specially established under the Council of Ministers to supervise and control the implementation of the plan. Not long ago, when people all over the world saw the promulgation of this plan, they were shocked by its greatness; now, when people all over the world see the achievements of the implementation of this great plan, they cannot help but be surprised by its significant achievements.

    苏联的防护林带计划
    苏联是世界森林资源最丰富的国家。全世界有价值的林木约有四分之一在苏联，广大的西伯利亚地区为无边无际的“黑色松林”所覆盖。然而社会主义的苏联，它决不仅仅满足于它的得天独厚，它正以震惊世界的魄力，进一步征服灾荒保证年年丰收而积极从事造林事业。苏联造林事业计划中最主要部分，于一九四八年十月二十日颁布，为了矫正大自然的错误，特作了“关于创造森林防护带，实行农作物与牧草轮种制，建造池塘和蓄水池，保证苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带年年丰收的计划”，苏联的欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带，本来是幅员广阔、土壤肥沃的农业区域，是苏联的重要谷仓。但是，这一带地区因为来自中亚细亚沙漠地带的热风吹袭，差不多每隔三年就要发生一次旱灾，要使农业受到相当损失。沙俄时代的人民用苦难迎接了旱灾；但今日，社会主义的苏联则决不容许大自然这样猖狂。经过科学家的专心研究，苏联部长会议及联共中央委员会终于根据了斯大林的建议，制订了伟大的创造防护林改变自然消灭灾害的计划。
    计划规定在十五年以内，就要创建八条主要的国有森林防护带。第一条也是最长的一条，将从乌拉尔山脉起到里海为上，长一千零八十公里，宽一公里（分成六列栽植，每列间隔二百公尺）；第二条将沿伏尔加河两岸栽植，长九百公里；其余的六条也将沿着别的河道栽植。这八条防护林的总长为五千三百二十公里，总面积为十一万七千九百公顷。
    计划中还规定，在这一地带的国家农场与集体农场，要有计划地在农场田地周围、在沟壑和山谷的斜坡上、在湖泊的岸旁、在池塘与蓄水池周围，于十五年内植造总面积五百七十万零九千公顷的防护森林。
    社会主义国家、布尔什维克党的言行永远是一致的，当这计划颁布以后，在这一带地区已经有二万个造林队组织起来，其中七百六十名领队的人员受到了专门的科学训练，农业学校中也立刻开始训练了七千二百名的森林改良人才。大批的科学院的专家，大量的最新式的机器，被组织在造林计划中，部长会议之下并特设了一个植造森林防护带中央委员会，专门监督及管制计划的执行。不久以前，当全世界的人们看到这一计划的颁布时，为它的伟大性而震动了；现在，当全世界人们看到这一伟大计划的实施成绩时，又不得不为它的重大成就而吃惊。
