    Taiyuan Textile Factory and others Resume Production
    Zhengxing Machine Factory Workers Voluntarily Hand Over Materials
    [Taiyuan Electric] The light industries of Taiyuan, such as the Taiyuan Textile Factory, Jinhua Cigarette Factory, and the flour mill in the city, have all resumed production. During the war, the opening and cleaning room of the Taiyuan Textile Factory was collapsed, and all nine opening and cleaning machines were burned. The factory partially resumed production on April 27th, starting 153 looms, 3 spinning frames, and 2 roving frames. All employees are at work, with 254 male and female workers. Five opening and cleaning machines will also be rushed to repair and resume operation within five or six days. The flour mill in the city also officially resumed production on the evening of May 1st after repairing the wheat bins. The Jinhua Cigarette Factory held a resumption ceremony at 10:00 am on the 7th of this month. To rush to grind flour, the workers of the flour mill automatically requested to work as usual on "May Day" Labor Day. The female workers of the textile factory have never been so lively. The workshops are full of songs and laughter, and they are intensifying their studies. The Jinhua Cigarette Factory has started two cigarette-making machines and three tobacco-cutting machines. Other cigarette-packing, stem-removing, and tobacco-baking machines have also been started. On the first day, twelve boxes of cigarettes were produced in four hours, more than double the daily output during the Yan bandit period.
    [Taiyuan Electric] The workers of Zhengxing Machine Factory enthusiastically responded to the government and the trade union's slogan "All weapons and public property must be returned to the public," and voluntarily handed over many public materials and weapons. After the young worker Li Zizhi handed over the first file, the leadership praised him, and workers Sun Fu, Zhang Bingyin, Yang Helian and others actively handed over items one after another. Under the leadership of worker Li Yuqiang, twelve patrol teams have been formed to patrol the surrounding areas at night in cooperation with the garrison to prevent sabotage by special agents.

    【太原电】正兴机器厂工友，热烈响应政府与工会“一切武器、公物要归公”的口号，自动交出许多公用物资与武器。青年工人李自智第一个交出锉刀后，领导上当予表扬，陆续又有工友孙福、张丙寅、杨合连等踊跃交出。在工友李玉强的带领下，已组成十二个纠察队，在晚间配合驻军四周巡逻，防止特务破坏。
