　　Record of North China Worker Representatives
　　By Our Correspondents Shang Kai, Lu Hao

　　Peasant's Son Zhen Rongdian Visits Moscow and Warsaw
　　The brilliant Soviet October Revolution Medal on the chest of Special-Class Labor Hero Zhen Rongdian attracted the attention of the people around him.

　　"I attended the Warsaw World Youth Workers Conference last August and returned home via Moscow in October," Zhen Rongdian said. "Look, even a country bumpkin worker like me has been abroad now." He continued to recount how, in the exhibition hall of the Kremlin in the Soviet Union, he saw the backward industry of the Tsarist era, but after the revolution, in less than a few decades, the Soviet Union had been built into a socialist country. Therefore, he affirmed, "Our Chinese revolution is about to succeed, and I believe our Chinese construction will be even faster."

　　In the Soviet Union, he received warm receptions from all sides. Once, he went to visit a children's school, and a group of three- and four-year-old children ran to the classroom door to welcome him, shake his hand, and say "Здравствуйте!" (Hello!). Then they led him to see the small cars and airplanes that the children had made themselves. One of the children triggered the spring of a small airplane, causing it to fly into the air. All of this made him deeply feel that even very young children in the Soviet Union knew to be so enthusiastic towards someone like him.

　　He went to Warsaw to participate in the World Youth Workers Conference and the international youth parade. The first row of the procession was Spain, and the second row was China. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao received "enthusiastic" cheers from the people of Warsaw.

　　What he could not forget the most was his participation in the International Labor Brigade in Warsaw, living and working together with labor brothers from various countries, speaking dozens of different languages, helping the people of Warsaw heal the wounds inflicted by the fascists and rebuild Warsaw.

　　Twelve years ago, Zhen Rongdian was still a landless peasant. Three years of hired labor life educated him, making him deeply realize that the society at that time was: "Those who earn money don't work hard, and those who work hard don't earn money." When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, he resolutely walked into the Taihang Mountains. More than ten years of struggle have trained him into a staunch fighter of the working class. He looked up at the arrow tower above Qianmen and said to the reporter solemnly: "Country bumpkin workers like us can only go to Moscow, Warsaw, and Leningrad under the leadership and education of the Communist Party. I never imagined this."

　　Defending the Transportation Line with His Life: The Perilous Postal Worker Zhou Ruilin
　　Zhou Ruilin is a worker representative from the Jidong Postal Bureau, born forty-nine years ago in a poor peasant family in Qian'an County, Jidong.

　　The enemy had carried out extremely cruel "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeps" against the Jidong Anti-Japanese base area. In this severe period, the Party gave Zhou Ruilin the important task of maintaining a 120-li transportation line, which included three deep blockade trenches, two heavily guarded blockades, sixty li of towering mountains and a turbulent Luan River, from the northeastern corner of Qian'an, bypassing Fengrun to Luanxi. During the Anti-Japanese War, he persisted on this line for four years.

　　Once, Zhou Ruilin passed through a blockade line and two blockade trenches, and after a forty-li forced march, arrived at the bank of the Luan River. The ferry crossing was often blocked by the enemy, and the river ice was broken by the enemy, preventing people from passing. He quickly took off his cotton coat, which was almost soaked with sweat, and holding his clothes and documents in one hand, resolutely jumped into the turbulent Luan River. His companions also jumped in. He lost consciousness in this huge ice cellar. When the waves hit, he retracted his head into the water, and when ice blocks attacked, he pushed them away with his hands. He clenched his teeth to keep his body from shivering. Finally, he successfully crossed the Luan River and quietly climbed over dozens of yards of icy sand. The river water had frozen a thin layer on his muscles. When he climbed out of the dangerous area, a burst of energy rose up, and the ice shards on his body fell off one after another. At this time, his blood had almost congealed, and he said, "I used running to heat it up." When he returned this time, he still crossed the river here, accidentally stepping into a three-meter-deep pit in the river. By the time he struggled ashore, his cotton coat was soaked with river water. He wrung it out twice, gritted his teeth, and put it back on. At dawn, he walked into the Anti-Japanese base area, stopped to take a breath, and saw that his whole body had turned into a hard and slippery ice armor.

　　The ferocious enemy frequently carried out repeated "sweeps." Zhou Ruilin carried the documents on his back and shuttled through the enemy's gaps. Relying on his courage and resourcefulness, he cleverly broke through the encirclement every time. Once, he was surrounded in a village. He thought, "People, I can fight them; but what about the documents? I can't lose them." Time did not allow him to hesitate any longer. He took off his cotton coat, wrapped the documents well, and crawled forward naked on the frozen snow, biting his teeth. After crawling for three li, he finally passed through the strict sentry network. When he got up to put on his clothes, he found countless wounds on his frozen, reddish-purple muscles, but he said happily, "It doesn't matter, bringing the documents out is victory."

　　In the summer, Zhou Ruilin still carried the documents on his back and swam across the Luan River. Once, just as he had swum to the center of the river, a sudden wave knocked him unconscious. The river water washed him away for two or three li. When he woke up, the documents were still tightly held in his hand. After crossing the river, the enemy was "clearing." He was so familiar with the terrain that he twisted and turned through forty li of sorghum fields, cleverly avoiding the enemy. When he arrived at Majiashan, he found that two ravine roads had also been blocked. The cunning enemy had set up seven consecutive blockade lines, making it difficult for you to fly over.

　　"What to do?" he thought. "To complete the Party's task, I can only climb the mountain peaks." He tightened his belt, took off his shoes and socks, and carried everything on his back. He was about to start climbing the mountain. On the cliffs several meters high, he used his fingers to grab the stone cracks and his toes to step on the stone teeth, inch by inch slowly climbing. Looking up, it was a steep cliff; looking down, it was dizzying. He said: At that time, his mood was extremely simple, just thinking: "I would rather fall to my death than be killed by the enemy." After climbing a layer of stone cliffs, there was another layer of stone cliffs, crossing a mountain ridge, and then another mountain ridge. His hands were broken, and his feet were also broken. His strength was exhausted. He sat down under the stone cliff to catch his breath, grabbed a handful of fried rice from the rice bag, washed it down with cold water, and continued climbing.

　　Zhou Ruilin spent a long period of time in difficulty and danger. Today, he has come to Beiping. Recalling the heroic deeds of that year and looking at the glory of today's victory has given his body and mind, which have undergone a long struggle, great comfort.

　　A Technician Who Doesn't Consider Himself a Technician: Comrade Kang Bo Closely Links with Workers
　　Comrade Kang Bo is a technician at the Jizhong Yonghua Match Company, but everyone says he is just like a worker. This is not only because he is usually covered in oil stains and mingles closely with the workers, but mainly because he does not consider himself a technician and is willing to humbly learn from the masses of workers.

　　In the past, Yonghua Company used red phosphorus to make matches, but it ignited slowly. If yellow phosphorus was used, it was poisonous, and phosphorus sesquisulfide could not be bought. Comrade Kang Bo studied physics at Peking University and was a physics and chemistry teacher at a middle school before the incident. He only had book knowledge about such things. The worker Dan Shengcai had only made phosphorus sesquisulfide in Tianjin and did not know about the principles involved. So the two of them cooperated to design a boiler, add materials separately, visit each other, and learn from each other, so that the rules of the book and practical experience could be well combined, and they constantly listened to the opinions of the workers in their work. For example, when designing the boiler, the tripod on the boiler mouth was too thick, which made it easy to leak air, and it was not solved until it was thinned according to the workers' opinions. As a result, phosphorus sesquisulfide was finally successfully manufactured, which solved a major problem for the Yonghua Match Company at that time.

　　Combining technology with the masses, so that the work of research and improvement of technology is not just a matter for a few technicians, Comrade Kang Bo used the method of forming a technical team centered on the problem wherever a problem occurred or existed. There are now six such technical teams, with more than forty workers participating. For example, in the past, sieving was inefficient, mainly because the large sieve had small gaps and could not leak through. Only 200 jin could be sieved a day, so four carpenters and ironworkers formed a large sieve modification team. After everyone's enthusiastic research and modification, 1,500 jin can now be sieved every day.

　　Truly absorbing experienced workers to participate in the work of improving technology will make the masses of workers generally concerned about technology, in order to save raw materials and improve efficiency. For example, the splitting knife frame has to be sharpened every day, which is very troublesome to install and not easy to align. Now, they want to get rid of the trouble of aligning the knife and imitate a machine like the stalk cutter. In order to solve this problem, the workers have also organized a team, and more than half of the thirty or forty people in the oil medicine cover team are now participating in this team. They are studying how to reduce double-headed matches. In the work of improving technology and improving efficiency at the Yonghua Match Company, the close connection between technician Kang Bo and the masses of workers has been successful, so he was elected by all the workers as a representative to attend the North China Workers' Conference.

　　记华北职工代表
    本报记者  商恺  陆灏
　　贫农的儿子甄荣典到了莫斯科和华沙
    特等劳动英雄甄荣典的胸前，有一颗灿烂夺目的苏联十月革命纪念章，吸引住了周围人们的视线。
    “我是去年八月参加华沙世界青工会议，于十月经莫斯科回国的。”甄荣典说：“你看一个土豹子工人，现在也到外国去啦。”他继续讲述他在苏联克里姆林宫的陈列室里，看到沙皇时代落后的工业，可是革命后不到几十年，苏联就建设成一个社会主义的国家。因此他肯定的说：“咱们中国的革命就要成功了，我相信咱们中国的建设一定更快。”
    在苏联，他受到了各方面热烈地接待。有一次他去参观一个儿童学校，一群三四岁的孩子都跑到教室门口来欢迎他，和他握手，再说一声“得拉斯基！”（你好的意思）然后领他去看儿童们自己造的小汽车、小飞机，其中有一个孩子拨动了小飞机的弹簧，使它飞到了空中，这一些都使他深深感到连苏联很小的儿童，也懂得对他这样的热情。
    他去华沙参加了世界青工会议，和国际青年大游行，行列的第一排是西班牙，第二排就是中国，毛主席巨幅的画像，受到了华沙人民“热烈”的欢呼。
    最使他不能忘记的：是他在华沙参加了国际劳动纵队，和各国的劳动弟兄，讲着几十种不同的语言，生活在一起，劳动在一起，帮助华沙人民医治法西斯所给予的创伤，重建华沙。
    甄荣典十二年前还是一个没有土地的农民，三年的雇工生活教育了他，使他深深体验到当时的社会是：“挣钱的不卖力，卖力的不挣钱。”抗日战争爆发了，他毅然走进了太行山区。十余年的斗争，已将他锻炼成一个工人阶级的坚强战士。他抬头望了望前门上的箭楼，对记者严肃的说：“象我们这样的土豹子工人，只有在共产党领导教育下才能到莫斯科，到华沙，到列宁格勒，这真是我从来没有想到的。
　　用生命保卫了交通线　历尽艰险的邮工周瑞林
    周瑞林，是冀东邮政局的职工代表，四十九年前，生在冀东迁安县一个贫苦农民的家里。
    敌人曾经对冀东抗日根据地实行过极其残酷的“清剿”“扫荡”，就在这严重的时期，党给了周瑞林以重大的任务——经常保持从迁安的东北角绕过丰润至滦西的一百二十里交通线路，这中间要越过三道深深的封锁壕，两道戒备森严的封锁线，五十里崇山峻岭，一条白浪湍急的滦河。抗日战争中他在这一条线路上坚持了四年之久。
    有一次，周瑞林穿过了一道封锁线，两道封锁壕，以四十里的急行军，到了滦河的岸边。渡口经常被敌人封锁着，河冰被敌人打碎了，障碍人们通过。他迅速地脱下几乎为汗水湿透的棉衣，用一只手托着衣服和文件，毅然的跳进了湍急的滦河，他的同伴也跟着跳了下去。他在这个巨大的冰窑中错乱了知觉。浪涛打过来，他把头缩进水里，冰块袭来了，用手把它推开。他咬紧了牙关不让身体打颤。终于胜利的渡过滦河。又悄悄爬过几十丈冰砂。河水竟在肌肉上冻结了一层薄冰，爬出危险地带时，一股劲立起来，身上的冰片纷纷剥落。这时血液几乎已凝结了，他说：“我是用跑步来烧热了它。”这次返回的时候，他仍从这里过河，不小心踏进河中一丈深的陷窝里，等他挣扎上岸后，棉衣已被河水浸透，拧了两把，咬咬牙再将它穿上，黎明的时候他走进了抗日根据地，停下来喘一口气，看看全身已变成坚滑的冰甲了。
    凶残的敌人经常进行反复“扫荡”，周瑞林背着文件在敌人的空隙里穿来穿去，靠了他的勇敢和机智，每一次都巧妙的突出了重围，有一次他被包围在一个村庄里，他想：“人，可以和他拼；可是文件呢？不能丢。”时间已不容许他再犹豫，他脱下棉衣，包好文件，全身一丝不挂，咬紧牙关，在冰冻的雪地上匍匐前进，爬了三里地，终于穿过了森严的哨网，当他起来穿衣的时候，发现冻得红紫的肌肉裂了无数的伤口，但他却愉快的说：“没关系，把文件带出来就是胜利”。
    在夏季，周瑞林仍然背着文件横渡滦河。有一次他刚泅到河中心，迎面一个急浪把他打晕了，河水将他冲了二三里，醒来的时候，文件还紧紧的握在手里。过了河，敌人正在“清剿”。他是那样熟悉地形，曲折迂回地穿过了四十里高粱地，巧妙的躲开了敌人。到了马家山，他发现两条涧道又被封锁。狡猾的敌人一连又设立了七道封锁线，使你插翅也难飞过。
    “怎么办呢？”他想：“完成党的任务，只有攀沿山峰。”他紧了紧腰带，脱下了鞋袜，将一切东西都背在背上，他要开始攀山了。在几丈高的峭壁上，他用手指扣住石缝，用脚趾踏住石牙，一寸一寸慢慢攀登，往上看陡壁悬崖，往下看头晕眼花。他说：当时心情极为简单，只是想着：“宁摔死，也不让敌人打死”。攀上一层石崖，又是一层石崖，翻过一道山岭，又是一道山岭。手破了，脚也破了，力气尽了，坐到石崖下喘喘气，从米袋里抓一把炒米，用冷水送进肚里，再继续攀登。
    周瑞林在艰难危险中渡过悠长的岁月，今天来到了北平。回想当年的英雄事迹，看看今天胜利的光荣，使他经过长期斗争的身心，获得了莫大的安慰。
　　不以技师自居的技师　康波同志密切联系工人
    康波同志是冀中永华火柴公司的技师，但任何人都说他完全象一个工人。这不只是因为他平时常常满身油垢，和工人亲密的打成一片，主要是他不以技师自居，肯虚心低头向工人群众学习。
    过去永华公司制火柴，都用赤磷，但发火慢，如用黄磷又有毒，硫化磷又买不到。康波同志在北大学过物理，事变前是个中学教物理化学的教员，对于这样的事，他只有书本上的知识；而工人单生才，也只是在天津做过硫化磷，关于原理上的事，他也不知道，于是他们两人就合作起来，设计锅炉，分着加料，互相访问，互相学习，使书本的规矩和实际的经验能很好的结合起来，并在工作中不断听取工人的意见。如当时设计锅炉时，锅口上的三角架太厚，因此容易漏气，按着工人的意见薄以后才算解决。结果硫化磷终于制造成功了，这给当时的永华火柴公司解决了一个大问题。
    将技术和群众结合，使研究和改进技术的工作，不只单是几个技术人员的事，康波同志用了哪里发生或存在着问题，哪里就以问题为中心组织技术小组的办法，这样的技术小组现在有六个，参加的工人共有四十多位。如过去过筛子，效力小，主要是大筛子缝小，漏不下去，筛的时候一天只能筛二百斤，于是四个木工铁工，凑在一起成了一个改装大筛子小组，经过大伙热心的研究改装以后，现在每天可筛到一千五百斤了。
    真正吸收有经验的工人参加改进技术的工作，这就会使得工人群众普遍的关心技术，以节省原料，提高效率。如分刀架子每天要磨，按装很费事，且不容易对好，现在想废去对刀子的麻烦，仿造切梗子那样的机器，为了设法解决这个问题，工人们也组织了一个小组，而象油药盖小组，一共三、四十人，现在半数以上参加了这个小组，他们正在研究如何减少双头火柴。永华火柴公司在改进技术、提高效率的工作上，技师康波同志和工人群众联系密切是有成绩的，因此他这次被全体职工选为出席华北职工会议的代表。
