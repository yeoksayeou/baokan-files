    "Bonn Constitutional Assembly" -- Headed by the United States, the imperialist countries, because they want to use West Germany as a base for aggression in Europe, have adopted a policy of splitting Germany and actively establishing a West German puppet government as a tool for aggression. In February and April 1948, the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg held meetings in London and, according to the US imperialist plan, decided on a plan to split Germany. In July of the same year, the governors of the United States, Britain, and France issued an order to the "Federal Chancellors" of West Germany in Frankfurt, West Germany, to establish a puppet government (this was the Frankfurt Conference). On September 1, the so-called "Constitutional Assembly" composed of 65 reactionary leaders from a group of West German reactionary parties – the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, the German Party, the Center Party, etc. – opened in Bonn, in the British zone of West Germany. The "Bonn Constitutional Assembly" is such a meeting to create a puppet for US imperialism, and the West German Communist Party and the German people and democratic parties have expressed their firm opposition.
    Wrocław Peace Congress -- Wrocław is a city in western Poland, formerly the German city of Breslau. From August 25 to 28, 1948, representatives of cultural workers from 46 countries held the "World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace" here.
