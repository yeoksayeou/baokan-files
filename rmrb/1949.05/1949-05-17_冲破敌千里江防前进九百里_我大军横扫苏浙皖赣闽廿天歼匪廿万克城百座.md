Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 15th: A front-line reporter reports on the military developments since the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River: After the People's Liberation Army broke through the Yangtze River defense line painstakingly built by the Kuomintang bandit army for more than three months, it surged south with irresistible force. In just over twenty days, it swept across the vast areas of the southeastern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, controlling the three railways of Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai), Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou), and Zhegan (Zhejiang-Jiangxi), except for Shanghai and Nanchang. One hundred and two county towns were liberated, and Nanjing, the counter-revolutionary center of the Kuomintang for twenty-two years, and provincial capitals such as Zhenjiang and Hangzhou were occupied. The advance reached approximately eight or nine hundred li, and nearly 200,000 Kuomintang bandit troops were annihilated. Now, it is besieging Shanghai, the largest city in China, on the banks of the Huangpu River in the east, pressing towards Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, in the west, and deeply penetrating the Fujian Province to eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang.

The People's Liberation Army, crossing the Yangtze River on a thousand-li front, developed in three directions. The Central Route PLA, crossing the river from the Wuhu-Anqing section, and the Eastern Route PLA, crossing the river from the Nanjing-Jiangyin section, after liberating Nanjing, swept along the Jinghu line and the triangular area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Light industrial cities in southern Jiangsu, such as Wuxi and Wujin, fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army one by one. Then, they split into two routes and advanced southeast: one route advanced along the Jinghu Road and Huhang Road towards Shanghai, and the other route advanced along the Jinghang National Highway through western Zhejiang towards Hangzhou. The PLA advancing towards Shanghai has now occupied important outposts around Shanghai, such as Jiaxing, Jiashan, Songjiang, ＠山, Taicang, Jiading, Liuhe, and Luodian, cutting off all land routes to Shanghai, and Shanghai will soon be liberated. The PLA stationed in Hangzhou quickly crossed the Qiantang River and, with the cooperation of the people's guerrillas in Xiaoshan and other places, advanced south along the Zhegan Road, liberating Zhuji on the 7th; another route developed east along the Huhangyong Railway, occupying Shaoxing on the same day.

The Western Route PLA, crossing the river from the Anqing-Jiujiang section, also made rapid progress. After controlling the entire southern Anhui region, it advanced along the Jinggui Road towards northeastern Jiangxi, first cutting off the Kuomintang's so-called "new defense line," the Zhegan Road, in the Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Guixi areas. In the five days from the 5th to the 10th, it successively captured Shangrao, Yushan, Jiangshan, Quzhou, Longyou, Tangxi, Jinhua, Yiwu, and many towns on both sides of the Zhegan Road, and victoriously joined forces with the PLA advancing south from Hangzhou in the Zhuji area, controlling more than 1,100 li of the Zhegan Railway from Hangzhou to Dongxiang in Jiangxi. In this way, it destroyed all attempts by the Kuomintang remnants to rely on the mountainous areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to build a resistance line to prevent and delay the continued advance of the People's Liberation Army.

　　冲破敌千里江防前进九百里
    我大军横扫苏浙皖赣闽廿天歼匪廿万克城百座
    【新华社南京十五日电】前线记者报道人民解放军渡江作战以来军事发展的形势称：人民解放军冲破了国民党匪军三个多月来苦心经营的长江防线以后，汹涌南下，势如破竹，在仅仅二十几天的时间内，就横扫苏、浙、皖、赣、闽等东南诸省的广大地区，控制了除上海、南昌两点以外的京沪、沪杭、浙赣等三条铁路，解放一百零二个县城，占领国民党二十二年来的反革命中心南京和镇江、杭州等省会，前进约达八、九百里，并歼灭国民党匪军近二十万人。现在正向东围攻中国第一大都市黄浦江畔的上海，向西进逼江西省城南昌，向南深入福建省境扫荡国民党匪帮残余势力。
    在千里江面横渡长江的人民解放军是分作三路发展的。由芜湖安庆段渡江的中路解放军和由南京江阴段渡江的东路解放军，于解放南京后，即席卷京沪沿线及苏浙皖三角地区。江苏南部无锡、武进等轻工业城市，一一落入人民解放军之手。接着，便分为两路向东南挺进：一路沿京沪路及沪杭路向上海推进，一路沿京杭国道经浙西向杭州进攻。向上海前进的解放军，现已占领京沪、沪杭两路及其两侧的嘉兴、嘉善、松江、＠山、太仓、嘉定、浏河、罗店等上海外围重要据点，切断上海一切陆上的通路，上海不久就可得到解放。进驻杭州的解放军，迅速越过钱塘江，在萧山等地人民游击队的配合下，一路沿浙赣路向南推进，七日解放诸暨；一路沿沪杭甬铁路向东发展，于同日占领绍兴。
    由安庆九江段渡江的西路解放军，进展亦极迅速。于控制皖南全部地区后，即沿京贵路向江西东北部挺进，首在横峰、弋阳、贵溪地区切断了国民党所谓“新防线”的浙赣路，由五日至十日的五天内，连下浙赣路上的上饶、玉山、江山、衢州、龙游、汤溪、金华、义乌及铁路两侧的许多城镇，并在诸暨地区与由杭州南下的解放军胜利会师，控制了由杭州至江西东乡一千一百余里的浙赣铁路。这样，就摧毁了国民党残余力量企图依托闽浙赣山区构筑抵抗线，以阻止与延缓人民解放军继续前进的一切企图。
