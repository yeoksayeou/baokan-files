    Ignoring the Preliminary Agreement on the Establishment of the Four Powers
    US Imperialism Continues to Split Germany
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 8th】Ignoring the establishment of the preliminary agreement between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the German question, US imperialism is still continuing its activities to instigate the establishment of a West German state. According to a United Press report from Bonn: the so-called "Bonn Constitutional Convention," a puppet of the United States, passed a resolution on the 6th to establish a West German provisional government and approved the so-called West German constitution. The members of this provisional government (also known as the "Administrative Committee") have also been selected, including seven members from the Social Democratic Party, seven from the Christian Democratic Party, two from the Free Democratic Party, and one each from the German Party and the Center Party. When the Constitutional Convention passed the above resolutions, the representatives of the West German Communist Party, led by Lehmann, expressed their firm opposition.
