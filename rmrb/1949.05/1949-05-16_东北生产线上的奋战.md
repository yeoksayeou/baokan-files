　　Striving on the Northeast Production Line
    In recent days, reports from the Northeast production line have been extremely encouraging. The Fushun Coal Mine, by adjusting its labor organization, has saved three thousand laborers for production, and plans to increase crude oil production by half by the end of the year. Rescue workers at the Longfeng Coal Mine, in order to restore the mine's normal coal output by the end of June, are fighting with unparalleled heroism against intense heat and thick smoke, determined to open the "sealed areas" and pump out water, so that the buried minerals and machinery can produce more wealth for the people! Furthermore, workers in various coal mines, gold mines, and many state-owned enterprises in the Northeast are enthusiastically contributing labor and funds to support the early victory of the national liberation war. At the First Northeast Railway Workers' Representative and Model Worker Conference, a unanimous resolution was passed to complete this year's national transportation plan and strive to support railway construction within the customs. All these glorious achievements on the production line powerfully illustrate one thing: the working class, with the conscious attitude of masters of the country, is heroically shouldering the responsibility of creating a free and happy New Democratic country!

　　东北生产线上的奋战
    近几日，自东北传来的生产线上的报导是令人十分振奋的。抚顺煤矿因调整劳动机构，节省了三千劳动力到生产中来，年底还要将粗油生产提高产量一半。龙凤煤矿的救护工人为了在六月底恢复全矿的正常煤产量，正以无比的英雄气概与高热浓烟相搏斗，要挖开“密闭”，进行抽水，使埋藏的矿产与机器为人民生产更多的财富！而东北各煤矿、各金矿及许多公营企业的工人正热烈献工、献金以支援全国解放战争早获胜利。东北第一次铁路职工代表及劳动模范工作者大会上，全体一致决议完成今年国家运输计划，并努力支援关内铁路建设。这一切生产线上的辉煌成就有力地说明了一件事：工人阶级正以国家主人公的自觉态度，英勇地担负起缔造自由幸福的新民主主义国家的担子！
