Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th: Geneva Dispatch: The fourth annual meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) was held here from May 9th to 22nd. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and the United States participated in the meeting. The meeting discussed the economic situation in Europe in 1948 and individual issues in the European economy. Representatives of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe extensively criticized the economic policies adopted by the Western European governments and their serious negative consequences. Representatives from countries such as Britain, France, and Italy defended their economic policies at the meeting. However, some of them had to admit that the Marshall Plan, which guides the economic policies of Western European countries, had not actually solved any problems. An important result of the meeting was the adoption of a decision to establish a Foreign Trade Promotion Committee. The Foreign Trade Promotion Committee held its first meeting on the 23rd, attended by representatives from 24 European countries. The U.S. representative also participated in the work of the committee. Its main task is to study the issue of expanding the basis of trade between European countries.

    西欧代表已承认美援骗人
    大会决议扩大各国间贸易
    【新华社北平二十五日电】日内瓦讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会第四届年会于五月九日至二十二日在此间召开。参加会议者包括苏联、东欧、西欧及美国的代表。会议讨论了一九四八年欧洲的经济形势以及欧洲经济中的个别问题。苏联及东欧新民主国家的代表，曾在会上广泛地批评了西欧各国政府当局所采取的经济政策及其严重的恶果。英法意等国的代表在会上为他们的经济政策作辩护，但是，他们中间的某些代表，也不得不在会上承认：指导西欧诸国经济政策的马歇尔计划，实际上并未解决任何一个问题。会议的一个重要结果，是通过了设立对外贸易促进委员会的决定。对外贸易促进委员会已于二十三日举行第一次会议，出席者有欧洲二十四国代表，美代表也参加了委员会的工作，其主要任务为研究扩大欧洲各国间贸易基础的问题。
