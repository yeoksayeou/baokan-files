    Xin Zhuang and Duli Coal Mine Workers
    Donate Rice to Aid Disaster-Stricken People
    [Taihang Telegram] Workers at the Anyang Xinzhuang Coal Mine and Duli Coal Mine, affiliated with Taihang Industrial Corporation, are actively increasing production and donating money and rice to aid the disaster-stricken people in the Fourth and Fifth Special Districts (new districts) of northern Henan, who have suffered severe disasters caused by the plundering of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. The workers in the Duli mine's underground kiln have been working hard for days to increase production in order to aid the disaster-stricken people, increasing production by seventy baskets of coal (each basket weighing two hundred catties, totaling fourteen thousand catties), selling it for more than six thousand yuan. More than forty ironworkers and odd jobbers donated four thousand yuan. Workers and staff at Xinzhuang saved eight and a half catties of millet and donated more than three thousand yuan of wages to the disaster-stricken people. Yue Mingqing, a kiln worker at Duli, said, "It is right for us to sweat more to help the disaster-stricken people, because workers and peasants all over the world are one family."
