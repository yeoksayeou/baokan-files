　　All-China Students' Federation and Youth Student Representatives
  　Hold Meetings and Gatherings to Exchange Experiences
　　[From Our Own Correspondent] In order to understand the student movement situation in various regions and strengthen ties with students from all over the country, the All-China Students' Federation held talks with student representatives from various delegations attending the National Youth Congress, focusing especially on introducing the spirit of the Student Congress and its resolutions, as well as the situation of students in Beiping before and after liberation, to students from the South (including Taiwan, Guangzhou, Qiongya, Kunming, and Chongqing). Students from various regions also reflected on the local student situation. On the morning of May 16th, the All-China Students' Federation hosted a gathering for all student representatives at its headquarters. At the meeting, Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, reported on the work of the Federation since its establishment, and particularly expressed the hope that representatives would reflect more on the local student movement, introduce work experiences, and provide various materials after returning. Representatives from various regions spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their willingness to maintain closer contact with the All-China Students' Federation in the future. Student representatives from newly liberated areas and areas still under Kuomintang rule also guaranteed to convey the situation today, the spirit of the Student Congress resolutions, and the resolutions of this Youth Congress back to their fellow students, so as to quickly organize student associations and student federations after liberation, and unite closely with students and youth across the country. Finally, everyone danced "Unity is Strength," and the gathering concluded in cheerful and enthusiastic singing.
