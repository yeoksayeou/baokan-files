Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: According to Agence France-Presse, Moscow: Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, told reporters on the 9th that although the upper echelons of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations and the British Trades Union Congress decided to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions against the will of the majority of members, the total membership of the Federation has reached 67 million (64 million in 1945). He said that the increase in membership of the World Federation of Trade Unions is due to the fact that the trade unions of Japan and Germany in February, and the trade unions of Mongolia, Tunisia, and the Philippines this month, have been approved for membership.
