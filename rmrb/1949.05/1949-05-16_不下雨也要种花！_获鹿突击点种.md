"Plant Flowers Even If It Doesn't Rain!"
　　Huolu Launches a Rush Planting Campaign

　　[Chahar News] Party members and cadres in Huolu County are taking the lead in launching a large-scale cotton planting campaign. After Guyu (Grain Rain), when it still didn't rain, most villages wavered in their original cotton planting plans. Zhengjiazhuang in the First District originally planned for eighty mu, but later only intended to plant thirty-nine and a half mu. In some villages, the village cadres made crude arrangements, not specifically assigning tasks to each household, yet vaguely claimed that cotton planting was not a problem. Some district cadres also believed that planting could only be done when it rained, becoming followers of the masses. This stage of production fell into a state of laissez-faire. The county party committee made timely inspections and corrections to this situation, pointing out: "The leadership's role lies in overcoming natural disasters; cotton must be planted even if it doesn't rain." Each district conducted a general ideological review, criticizing the reliance on weather and the mentality of waiting. In terms of specific methods, the county party committee proposed: irrigate the watered land quickly and plant on the dry land, vigorously promote the burden policy, help the masses make household plans through accounting methods, and cadres personally help the masses with planting. These measures began to turn the situation around in the county. Comrade Shi Ze, the district secretary of the First District, went to Dujiazhuang and immediately helped Dong Laihe carry water and planted six fen. He also helped Li Faxing and his son pull a water cart to irrigate four mu of cotton fields for half a day. The happy old man said: "If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to plant." In the past eight days, he helped seven households, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses. Farmers in Gangshang and other villages emphasized that they were not used to planting cotton and that the soil was not good, so it wouldn't grow even if planted. When the district cadres explained that one jin of ginned cotton could offset eight jin of rice in public grain and that more cotton picking would not increase the burden, the farmers responded: "In that case, it's much better than planting crops." Liu Chang's wife from Nanganzi in the Ninth District listened to the propaganda and went back to tell her husband: "Everyone says it's good to plant cotton this year, but you don't know what's good for you. Even if you don't plant, I have to plant myself." She went to her parents' home to get cotton seeds and rushed to plant. Li Fengtai, a seventy-two-year-old farmer, said: "The superiors are telling us to plant cotton, definitely not to make us suffer! We can't just wait for rain." He immediately carried water and planted four mu with his son and daughter-in-law. The First, Second, Third, Eighth, and Ninth Districts have more dry land and are now fully planting. In all the villages where planting has gone well, party members and cadres have taken the lead, district cadres have personally taken action, and propaganda work has been more thorough. According to preliminary statistics, twenty-one villages in the Fourth District have planted over ten thousand mu of cotton, and have completed all the tasks. The entire county is currently in a rush. To prevent a shortage of seeds, the promotion agency has been entrusted to buy 10,000 jin.

　　“不下雨也要种花！”
  　获鹿突击点种
    【察哈尔讯】获鹿县党员干部积极带头展开种棉大突击，当谷雨后，天仍不雨，大部村庄动摇了原来种棉计划。一区郑家庄原计划八十亩，后只打算种三十九亩半。有的村，村干布置粗枝大叶，并未具体布置到户，却空说种棉不成问题。部分区干部也认为下雨才能种，做了群众尾巴。这一阶段的生产，陷入自流状态。县委对此情况作了及时的检查纠正。指出：“领导作用在于战胜灾荒，不下雨也要完成种棉。”各区普遍作了思想检查，对靠天、等待思想作了批判。在具体做法上县委提出：水地快浇旱地点种，大力宣传负担政策，用算帐方式帮助群众作按户计划，干部亲自下手帮助群众点种。这些措施使全县开始扭转了局面。一区区书石泽同志下乡到杜家庄，立即帮助董来和担水，种了六分，又帮李法兴父俩半天拉水车浇四亩棉地，欢喜的老汉说：“要不是你，我们就种不上了”。八天来他帮助了七户，大大启发了群众积极性。岗上等村农民强调种棉不习惯、土性不好，种上也不长，当区干说明一斤皮棉顶八斤米交公粮，多摘棉花也不多负担时，农民反映说：“那么说，比种庄稼强的多”。九区南甘子刘常老婆听了宣传，回去和男人说：“人家谁都说今年种棉花好，你就不知道好歹，你不种我自己也得种。”到娘家去取了棉籽赶种，七十二岁老农李丰太说：“上级叫咱种棉花，决不是叫咱吃亏哩！不能光等下雨。”马上和儿子儿媳担水点种了四亩。一、二、三、八、九各区旱地较多，现正在全面点种。凡种好的村都是党员干部带头、区干亲自动手，宣传工作较深入。据初步统计，四区二十一个村，已植棉万余亩，已扫数完成任务。全县现正突击。为防止种籽不足，又委托推进社买来一万斤。
