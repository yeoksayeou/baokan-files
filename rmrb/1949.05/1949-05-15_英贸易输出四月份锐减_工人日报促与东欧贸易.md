    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 13th: London - According to the British Board of Trade's announcement on the 9th, the total value of British exports in April was £137.4 million. This figure is £22.5 million less than in March, the lowest since September last year. The trade deficit in April increased to £44.7 million, more than £20 million higher than in March. People from all walks of life in Britain are anxious about the decline in exports. The Worker's Daily pointed out: People have every reason to feel uneasy about the sharp decline in exports, because this trend means a large increase in unemployment. The newspaper strongly urged the development of trade between Western countries and Eastern European countries, and an end to the economic discrimination against Eastern European countries organized by the United States and supported by the British government.
