Brief Comments

    Skilled at Using Living Funds
    Fourteen gold and silver ornament businesses, including Lao Feng Xiang, have been approved to exchange gold and silver at preferential rates, turning dead funds into living capital. It is hoped that these businesses will make good use of this opportunity. The People's Government is advising these businesses to switch industries precisely because gold and silver ornaments are not beneficial to the people's lives. Absolutely do not engage in undertakings that are not beneficial to the people, such as using funds for speculation and disrupting the market, which is even more forbidden by law. There will definitely be no good ending. Some grain consignment shops in Peiping have suffered from being dishonest. In the people's city, one can only do business honestly, earn a certain legal profit, and do some things that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    Removing Burdens
    Mayor Ye encouraged the transformation of thought at the opening ceremony of the Peiping Administrative Cadre School, which is very important. All existing personnel in current work positions should also strive to transform their own thoughts, because since we come from a dirty old society and have served the ruling class for a period of time, we must have brought some old ideas and old work styles that are inconsistent with the interests of the people. Only by removing these ideological burdens can we truly serve the people well.

　　三言两语
    善于利用活的资金
    老凤祥等十四家金银饰物业被核准以优待比价兑换金银，使死的资金变成活的资本，希望这些商号善于利用。人民政府其所以劝令这些商号转业，就是因为金银饰物业对人民生活无益。切不可从事无益于人民的事业，如利用资金投机倒把，捣乱市场，则更为法律所不许。也决没有什么好下场。平市曾有某些粮食代销店就是吃了不老实的亏。在人民的城市里，只能老老实实做买卖，赚取一定的合法利润；作一些有益于国计民生的事业。
    去掉包袱
    叶市长在平市行政干校开学典礼上，勉励改造思想，这是非常重要的。一切现在工作岗位上的旧有人员，也应该努力改造自己的思想，因为我们既然来自肮脏的旧社会，又在一个时期替统治阶级服了务，就一定或多或少带来了某些不合于人民利益的旧思想旧作风，去掉了这些思想包袱，才能真正很好的为人民服务。
