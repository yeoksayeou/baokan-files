The victorious situation and the task of production and construction require us to have more literary and artistic works to express this rich reality. We are required to launch criticism and self-criticism, discuss and study writing problems through specific works, and further improve on the basis of existing literary and artistic creation!

The launch of "Weekly Literature and Art" requires workers, peasants, soldiers and their cadres, students, intellectuals, painters, poets, writers, literary critics, folk artists, and all literary and art lovers to contribute and give us advice so that it can be gradually consolidated and developed under everyone's cultivation and care.

The form of writing is not limited. We welcome short stories, poems, lyrics, scripts, essays, newsletters, reports, woodcuts, cartoons, drama reviews, film reviews, literary theory, new book introductions, etc. In terms of language and expression techniques, it should be popular, concise, easy to read, and easy to understand.

The content of the works should have rich ideological content, and should be able to express the characters, stories, and various realistic situations in the works appropriately and powerfully through literary and artistic forms, so that it can obtain a strong response and resonance among the broad masses. It would be best if the text can be short and concise.

    我们的话
    胜利的形势，和生产建设的任务，要求我们在更多的文艺作品，来表现这个丰富的现实。要求我们展开批评与自我批评，通过具体作品，讨论、研究写作问题，并从现有文艺创作基础上再提高一步！
    星期文艺的创刊，要求工、农、兵及其干部、学生、知识分子、画家、诗人、作家、文艺批评家、民间艺人，及一切文艺爱好者，都给我们写稿、提意见，使它在大家的培养爱护下，逐渐巩固、发展起来。
    写稿的形式不拘，凡是短篇小说、诗歌、唱词、剧本、散文、通讯、报告、木刻、漫画、剧评、影评、文艺理论、新书介绍等，我们都欢迎。在语言及表现手法上，要求通俗、明快、容易读、容易懂。
    作品的内容要有丰富的思想性，要能够把作品中的人物、故事、及各种现实情景，通过文艺形式恰当而有力地表达出来，使它在广大群众中获得强烈的感应与共鸣。文字顶好能做到短小精悍。
