　　Dig Wells to Fight Drought in Eastern Hebei
  　Rush to Plant Cotton Before Lesser Fullness
    [Tangshan, 20th dispatch] Under the leadership of Party and government cadres, farmers in eastern Hebei are continuing to dig wells to fight drought, making a final rush to plant cotton before Lesser Fullness [a solar term around May 21]. Since the beginning of spring, the 14th District's Pinggu, Miyun, Shunyi, and other areas have not had a thorough rain. Each county has successively dispatched cadres to organize cotton planting work teams, and universally mobilized the masses to dig wells and sow seeds. The entire district has already dug more than a thousand wells. The Sanhe County Party Committee also printed three types of small booklets such as "Introduction to Cotton Planting Experience" and "Cultivation Methods," going deep among the masses to carry out propaganda and education, overcoming the masses' erroneous ideas of waiting for rain and relying on heaven for food. From May 5th to 16th, incomplete statistics for the entire county show that 15,965 mu of cotton have been planted, accounting for 76 percent of the original plan. After the cotton planting work teams of the 15th Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office went to various counties, they immediately cooperated with county and district cadres to carry out propaganda and mobilization, organizing Party members and cadres to take the lead in digging wells and planting seeds. Partial statistics up to the beginning of May show that 1,109 wells have already been dug. Baodi County district cadres and work teams specifically helped farmers formulate well-digging plans and convened branch cadre meetings to carry out mobilization, which has achieved results. The majority of women also participated in the labor, and have already carried water to plant more than 8,000 mu of cotton. Xianghe County dug 960 wells and planted 8,000 mu of wheat in the drought resistance efforts during wheat planting. Changli and Leting counties have basically completed their cotton planting tasks. This is because the county Party committee attached importance to this work, paid attention to unifying the thinking of cadres and the masses, and, at the beginning of cotton planting, transferred all possible cadres from various organs to participate in this work, which enabled the cotton planting work to proceed smoothly. Leting completed 94 percent of its plan, exceeding last year's cotton planting area by 40,412 mu. Changli has completed 85 percent, 33,932 mu.

    【唐山二十日电】冀东各地农民在党、政干部领导下，正继续挖井抗旱，在小满以前做最后突击种棉。十四分区平谷、密云、顺义等地入春以来，未得透雨，各县均先后抽调干部组织种棉工作队，普遍发动群众挖井点种，全分区已挖井千余眼。三河县委还印刷了三种“种棉经验介绍”“栽培办法”等小册子，深入群众宣传教育，克服群众等待落雨和靠天吃饭的错误思想。全县自五月五日至十六日不完整的统计，已种棉一万五千九百六十五亩，占原计划的百分之七十六。十五地委、专署的植棉工作队分赴各县后，即与县区干部协同进行宣传动员，组织党员、干部带头打井点种，至五月初部分统计已打井一千一百零九眼。宝坻县区干部与工作队具体帮助农民订打井计划，召开支部干部会进行动员，已获成绩。大部妇女并参加劳动，已经挑水点种棉花八千多亩。香河县曾在种麦抗旱中打井九百六十眼，种麦八千亩。昌黎、乐亭两县种棉任务已基本完成。全县由于县委重视了这一工作，注意打通干部、群众的思想，在种棉开始即抽调各机关一切可能抽出的干部参加了这一工作，使种棉工作顺利开展。乐亭完成计划百分之九十四，已超过去年种棉面积四万零四百十二亩。昌黎已完成百分之八十五，三万三千九百三十二亩。
