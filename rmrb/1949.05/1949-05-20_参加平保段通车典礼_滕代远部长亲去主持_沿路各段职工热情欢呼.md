    [Baoding Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Reporter Chen Ji reports: The "Mao Zedong" locomotive departed from Beiping East Station for Baoding City for the first time at 10:00 AM on May 19th. On May 16th, the First Engineering Team of the Pingbao Section Railway Construction Office laid tracks southward from Gaobeidian, and the Second Engineering Team laid tracks northward from Baoding on March 25th. Under conditions of material shortage and transportation difficulties, on May 3rd, the workers repaired the entire 82 kilometers and 632 meters of the Gaobao section. The two teams of workers victoriously connected the tracks between Gucheng and Xushui. The Pingbao section, which had not been open to traffic for one year and seven months, was finally connected under the high enthusiasm of the working class. After the liberation of Beiping, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, which came to Ping from Harbin, honorably departed for Baoding on May 19th. Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, Comrade Gao Yuan, representative of the North China People's Government's Department of Transportation, representatives from the Beiping Military Control Commission, Deputy Director of the Pingjin Railway Administration Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Pingjin Railway Workers' General Union Li Lianshan, representatives from various departments of the Pingjin Railway Administration, and more than 100 guests from all walks of life, traveled together by train. Workers along the route warmly welcomed them. When passing by Beiheqiao, more than 100 workers from the bridge engineering team of the Pingbao Railway Construction Office lined up and shouted: "Celebrate the opening of the Pingbao line, learn from the working spirit of the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive!" Minister Teng Daiyuan personally inspected the Beiheqiao project and expressed his respect for the workers' performance. Locomotive driver and labor hero Li Yong of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive addressed all the bridge workers, calling on them to "build railways wherever the Liberation Army fights." This received a warm response and cheers from the workers. At 6:30 PM, they arrived at Baoding Station. Various organizations and groups in Baoding went to welcome them. The Baoding railway workers' Yangko team danced near the train, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The opening ceremony will be held today.
