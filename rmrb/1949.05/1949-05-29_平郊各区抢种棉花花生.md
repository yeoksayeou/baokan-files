　　Suburban Districts of Beijing
  　Rush to Plant Cotton and Peanuts
    [Our Dispatch] In the recent three days, the 11th, 19th, and 21st, the suburbs of Beiping experienced three rainfalls. Under the leadership of the district governments and with the help of the stationed troops, farmers in various districts are actively rushing to plant cotton, peanuts, and yams. As of the 26th, most areas have completed the rush planting, and a few areas can also complete it by the end of the month. For example, in the 13th district, which has more than 100,000 mu of arable land, more than 4,000 mu had been sown before the rain. After the first rainfall, 56,949 mu were rush-planted. The rest were all rush-planted after the second rainfall. The 20th district, which has the least sowing, has also rush-planted 80 percent and can complete all planting by the end of the month.
