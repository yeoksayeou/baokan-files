　　Our Army Strictly Observes City Discipline
　　Shanghai Citizens Praise Profusely
　　Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters Established
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] The People's Liberation Army's excellent discipline in Shanghai has won universal praise from the people of Shanghai. When the PLA first entered the city on the 25th, apart from a small number of troops assigned to guard enemy and puppet organizations, the rest of the troops rested and camped by the roadside. Even command organs such as the military headquarters and division headquarters were no exception. No one privately entered civilian houses in the bustling city, which stretched for dozens of miles. These soldiers, who had not slept for days and nights, lined up orderly on the sidewalks by the side of the road. Many of them talked intimately with the citizens who gathered around them, and sometimes sang songs in unison. The PLA soldiers politely declined the tea offered by the enthusiastic residents, eating their own meals that were delivered from the suburbs, thirty or forty miles away. From morning to night, PLA cooks carrying baskets of food were constantly on the move, an unprecedented spectacle in this international metropolis. All the horses of the troops were kept outside the city to avoid hindering city traffic and public health. Although all the shops opened immediately for business, no soldiers bought anything because the exchange rate between RMB and the bogus gold yuan was not yet stipulated at the time. The PLA's strict discipline and kind attitude towards the people surprised even the citizens who had already heard about it. Praises and eulogies from the citizens could be heard everywhere. In the suburbs of Shanghai, the PLA took time out from fighting to help the people with the summer harvest. A certain unit operating in Yuepu, because most of the residents in the war zone had gone out to avoid the war, and the wheat in the fields was already ripe, immediately helped the remaining farmers with the harvest. Many farmers praised these soldiers as being "as fierce as tigers in both fighting and working."
    [Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Shanghai, 30th news: The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was ordered to be established in Shanghai on the 29th of this month. Commander Song Shilun and Political Commissar Guo Huaruo also arrived at their posts on the same day.

　　我军严守城市纪律
  　上海市民交口称赞
  　淞沪警备司令部成立
    【新华社上海二十九日电】人民解放军在上海的优良纪律获得了上海人民的普遍赞颂。在二十五日解放军刚进入市区时，除了执行看管敌伪机关的少数部队外，其余的部队都在马路旁休息和露营，即使是军部、师部等指挥机关也没有例外，纵横几十里的繁华市区内没有一个人私入民房的。这些几天几夜没有休眠的战士们有秩序地排列在马路边的人行道上，许多人与围聚到跟前的市民亲密交谈，有时就齐声高唱歌曲。解放军战士们婉言谢绝了热情的居民们送来的茶水，吃着自己从三四十里地以外的市郊送来的饭食。从早到晚，担筐送饭的解放军炊事员们不绝于途，在这个国际大都会，这是从未见过的奇景。各部队的马匹都存放市外，以免妨碍市区的交通和公共卫生。虽然所有的商店都立即营业，但因为人民币和伪金圆券兑换的比值当时尚未规定，没有一个战士去买东西的。解放军的严明的纪律和对人民的态度的和蔼，连早已听说的市民都感到惊异。到处可以听到市民们的赞叹的颂扬。在上海市郊的解放军在战斗中抽空助民夏收。在月浦作战的某部，因战地居民大多出外躲避战火，而田里麦子却已熟透，于是该部立即帮助留下的农民收割。许多农民称赞这些战士们“打仗做活都象老虎一样猛”。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】上海三十号消息：中国人民解放军淞沪警备司令部，本月二十九号奉命在上海成立，司令员宋时轮，政治委员郭化若，也在当天到职视事。
