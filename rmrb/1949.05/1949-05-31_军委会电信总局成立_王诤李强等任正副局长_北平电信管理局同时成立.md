The Military Commission Telecommunications General Bureau Established
　　Wang Zheng, Li Qiang, and Others Appointed as Director and Deputy Directors
    The Beiping Telecommunications Bureau Simultaneously Established

    [This Newspaper's Report] The Telecommunications General Bureau of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau were formally established yesterday (30th). At the establishment meeting attended by two thousand people, Wang Zheng, Director of the Military Commission Telecommunications General Bureau, first conveyed the decision of the Military Commission, announcing the formal establishment of the General Bureau and the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, personnel appointments, and future work. The Military Commission decided: to appoint Wang Zheng as Director of the General Bureau, and Li Qiang, Liu Yin, Wang Zigang, and Zhong Fuxiang as Deputy Directors. (Wang Zigang concurrently serves as Director of the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, and Zhong Fuxiang concurrently serves as Director of the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau). The General Bureau has six departments: Business, Technology, Cadre, Materials, General Affairs, and Health, as well as an Industrial Management Department and a Secretariat with an Industrial Design Committee. Director Wang made the following explanation of this organizational form: First, this organizational form is still temporary. After the national liberation, appropriate adjustments will be made to absorb talent more broadly. Second, regarding the organizational form and the appointment of cadres at all levels, the directors of the General Bureau departments and above, and the directors of each command bureau are appointed by the Military Commission. The General Bureau appoints personnel above the section chief level to each command bureau. The appointment of personnel below the section chief level can be considered and discussed by each bureau and reported to the General Bureau for record. Third, we advocate expanding the power of each bureau to independently handle issues in general personnel administration. The political and economic treatment of the same level of management personnel is not exactly the same, and should be mainly based on ability, technical level, and work effectiveness as the criteria for evaluation and review. Talent, morality, and seniority should prioritize talent and morality, with seniority only in a secondary place, and appropriately considered. Director Wang particularly emphasized in his speech: Since the liberation of Beiping, some abnormal phenomena have appeared in various departments, such as the inability to command work and inconsistent steps, which need to be changed. In the future, attention should be paid to: (1) After the new organization is established and new supervisors are appointed, regardless of how they were in the past, after the Military Commission issues an order appointing them as supervisors and asking them to be responsible at the top, everyone should obey the guidance of supervisors at all levels. There should be mutual care, mutual assistance, and mutual improvement between superiors and subordinates, and between comrades. The situation below should be provided to the leadership for reference in a timely manner. (2) After the new organization is established, the democratization of management should be gradually realized. An enterprise management committee should be established. Relatively major issues should be discussed with relevant parties to concentrate the experience and opinions of all parties, and summarized regularly to continuously improve work. (3) Salary issues: There should be some changes. Fixed salaries are too unreasonable and should be abolished. In the past, the Kuomintang used personnel and determined treatment based solely on academic qualifications, personal feelings, friends, and relationships. These phenomena must be completely abolished in the future. The appointment of personnel and the regulations for salaries in the future should be based on whether they can complete work tasks, their past experience and current work technology and labor effectiveness, and their attitude towards serving the people. Qualifications can only be placed in a secondary position and appropriately considered. After the establishment of the management committee, adjusting salaries should be one of the central tasks. (4) Layoff issues: There will be some reductions, but only a few. The surplus personnel will be concentrated to carry out business and political studies, to learn the style and policies of handling affairs. To reduce the burden on the people, the salaries of these trainees should be lower than when they were employed. Everyone should think through this issue from the perspective of the long-term career prospects.

    Subsequently, Deputy Director Wang Zigang announced the establishment of the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau and the appointment of personnel. Finally, Comrade Liu Laifu, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, spoke, explaining that the establishment of the enterprise management committee is to achieve the goal of democratizing management. Under the centralized leadership of military representatives or factory directors, the strength of all employees is concentrated to do a good job in the factory. The conditions for members of the enterprise management committee are: 1. Support the principle of democratizing management; 2. Be familiar with their own business technology, have a correct labor attitude, and good compliance with labor discipline; 3. Be supported by the masses, be able to represent the opinions of the majority of employees, connect with the masses, and understand the opinions and requirements of the masses. Concrete candidates should be studied under these conditions after good deliberation and discussion during the election. Give full play to the strength and enthusiasm of all employees, establish a correct attitude for employees to manage enterprises, and lead the backward with the advanced, so that the enterprise management work can be done well. The meeting ended at twelve o'clock.
