    Employee Small Newspapers in Beiping City
    Cai Weizhong
    The liberated workers of Beiping, with unparalleled joy, have begun their studies. Many state-owned and public factories, under the leadership and assistance of the Party, the trade union, and work teams, have already published various employee small newspapers—learning gardens cultivated and managed by themselves.
    As of now, the data room of this newspaper has received thirteen kinds of employee newspapers from Beiping: some are mimeographed, some are printed; two are published every three days, six are published every five days, and three are published weekly; there is also one daily and one irregular publication. They are all active on the front lines of employee learning in a novel way, playing an active role in guiding and promoting the movement. The "Employee Small Newspaper" published by the Fengtai Railway Workers' Union reports on the production and learning of the liberated Fengtai employees in a lively, relaxed, and clear format. Particularly prominent is the large number of works written by the workers themselves published in each issue, and the addition of the "Workers' Garden" column, which has increased the workers' interest in learning to write. When a wave of support the army movement was launched in Beiping, the newspaper also joined the movement, publishing a "Support the Army Special Issue" on the same day, and issuing a commentary. What is even more noteworthy is the typeset "Railway Workers" published by the Beiping Railway Bureau, which is published every five days in an octavo format, publishing some short and powerful news and articles. The newspaper particularly emphasized the issue of employee learning; for this reason, it published an editorial calling on cadres to strengthen the leadership of employee learning, so that the working class can initially grasp mankind's most advanced science—Marxism-Leninism—through learning. Other publications, such as "Seventy Life" published by the Seventy Ordnance Factory and the "Employee Small Newspaper" published by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, have rich content, and employees are willing to read them. These small newspapers are an indispensable spiritual food for employees' lives. Every day, they learn our Party's policies, the government's laws, decrees, and resolutions; they also exchange various experiences with each other; at the same time, they see how they have changed their past labor attitudes and how they have brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity today to build new people's factories. All this is the huge role played by the employee small newspapers.
    However, these small newspapers still need to be improved in content and form. Based on what we have seen, we offer the following suggestions:
    (1) Some small newspapers lack work experience or production reports, with many long, empty news items and articles, which reduces readers' interest. This is a shortcoming that urgently needs to be corrected. For example, the "New Employee" newspaper published by the Beiping Fabric Factory does not adequately report on workers' active production enthusiasm and experience in production, especially production models among workers. From the second issue to the seventh issue, only one or two articles were related to production, which is too small in terms of quantity and quality.
    (2) The language is too profound and has not been popularized. This is a common phenomenon in mimeographed newspapers of various factories, which is worth paying attention to and improving in the future. We must be close to the workers, understand their thoughts, cultural level, and commonly used language, so that what we write is suitable for their tone and plays the role of newspaper propaganda and mobilization.
    (3) A "Criticism and Suggestions" column should be added to promote a democratic style. This is an excellent form and method to connect with the worker masses. However, the various mimeographed and printed newspapers that have been published have neglected this. In the future, each newspaper should set up a mailbox to collect as many opinions as possible from all workers on the administration, the trade union, or a certain individual. Only in this way can all employees fully grasp the weapon of "criticism and self-criticism," educate each other, and smoothly improve work efficiency to achieve the goal of increasing production.
    (4) When a certain movement reaches a climax or comes to an end, each small newspaper should publish editorials or short articles to guide employees' correct views and understanding of this movement, and point out the road that should be taken in the future, so that all employees can clearly distinguish the direction they should take. This is something that each small newspaper should do and is particularly necessary to do.

    北平市的职工小报
    蔡维中
    北平解放了的工人，以无比的愉快的心情开始了他们的学习，不少的国营与公营工厂在党、职工会、工作组的领导与帮助下已经出版了各种各样的职工小报——他们自己所经营、灌溉的学习园地。
    截至目前为止，本报资料室所收到的平市的职工报已达十三种：有油印的，也有铅印的；三日刊的两份，五日刊的六份，周刊的三份；还有日刊与不定期刊各一份。它们均以新颖的姿态活跃在职工学习的战线上，起了指导与推动运动的积极作用。丰台铁路职工会出版的“职工小报”，以一种活泼、轻松、清晰的形式报导。被解放了的丰台职工的生产和学习；特别突出的是每期都大最地登载了工人自己写的作品，增辟了“工人园地”专栏，提高了工人学习写作兴趣。在平市掀起劳军运动热潮时，该报也卷入了这个运动，当日出刊了“劳军专号”，并发评论。更引人注目的，是平市铁路局曾出版的铅印“铁路职工”，它以八开的版面每五天出版一次，登载了一些简短有力的新闻与文章。该报特别强调了职工的学习问题；为此，特发表了社论号召干部加强领导职工学习，使工人阶级通过学习能初步地掌握人类的最先进的科学——马列主义。其他如七十兵工厂出版的“七十生活”、石景山钢铁厂所出版的“职工小报”等，内容都还丰富，职工都愿意看它们。这些小报都是职工生活不可或缺的精神食粮。他们每天都从那里学习我党的政策、政府的法令决议；也互相地交流各种经验；同时也看到了他们是如何地改变过去的劳动态度与今天又如何发挥了他们积极性与创造性，来建设新的人民工厂。这一切，都是职工小报所起的巨大的作用。
    但这些小报，在内容与形式上都还需要改进。仅就所看到的提供以下几点意见：
    （一）一部份小报缺少工作上的经验或生产的报导，多内容空洞的长篇消息与文章，致减低读者兴趣。这是迫切需要纠正的一个缺点。如平市被工厂出版的“新职工”报，对工人的积极生产热情与生产中的经验，特别是工人中的生产典型模范报导的不够。从第二期开始到七期的五期的报导中，与生产有关的稿件仅有一两篇，这占的数量与质量对比上说实属太少。
    （二）文词太深，未能作到通俗化大众化。这是各工厂油印报普遍的现象，是值得今后注意与改进的。我们必须接近工人，了解他们的思想、文化程度和常用的语言，以后所写出的东西适合他们的口吻，起到报纸宣传和鼓动的作用。
    （三）应增设“批评与建议”栏，发扬民主的作风。这是一个联系工人群众的极好形式与办法之一。但所出版的各油印和铅印报对此均有所忽视，今后各报宜设置信箱，尽量收集所有工人对行政、职工会或某一个人的意见，唯有这样，才能充分使全体职工掌握到“批评与自我批评”的武器，互相进行教育，使工作效率得以顺利的提高，达到增产的目的。
    （四）当某一运动达到高潮或告一段落的时候，各小报宜发社论或短论，以引导职工对此一运动的正确的看法与认识，并指出今后应走的道路，使全体员工能清楚地辨明应走的方向。这是各小报应作而特别必要作的事情。
