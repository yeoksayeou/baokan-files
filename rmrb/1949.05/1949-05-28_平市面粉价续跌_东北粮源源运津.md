　　Flour Prices in Tianjin Continue to Fall
　　Grain from Northeast China Arrives in a Steady Stream
    [By Our Newspaper] Yesterday (27th), grain prices were roughly the same as the day before. Merchants' sentiment remained weak, so market transactions were sparse. The Grain Company sold 35 bags of flour and 97,000 jin of various coarse grains yesterday morning. Market prices for coarse grains were stable and sluggish; rice fell by 2 yuan per jin, and flour continued to fall by 100 yuan per bag.
    [Further News] Large quantities of grain from Northeast China and other places are being transported to Tianjin. From the 11th to the 25th of this month, 67.19 million jin of coarse and mixed grains have arrived, of which 56% were transported by private merchants. Apart from some wheat, flour, and rice from the Bohai and Southern Hebei regions, the majority of the coarse grains came from Northeast China. They are still arriving in a steady stream.

　　平市面粉价续跌
  　东北粮源源运津
    【本报讯】昨（二十七）日粮价与前日大致相等。商人心气仍软故市场成交稀少。粮食分公司昨晨出售数量，计面粉三十五袋，各种粗粮九万七千斤。市价粗粮平疲，大米每斤落二元，面粉每袋续落一百元。
    【又讯】东北等地粮食大量运津，由本月十一日至二十五日，已运到粗细杂粮六七一九万斤，内由私商运来的占百分之五十六。其中除部分小麦、面粉、大米来自渤海、冀南区外，其余大部粗粮来自东北。现仍在源源不断运来。
