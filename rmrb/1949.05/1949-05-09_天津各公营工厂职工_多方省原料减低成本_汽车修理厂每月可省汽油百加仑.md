Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th. Workers in Tianjin's state-owned enterprises, including the Automobile Manufacturing and Parts Factory, the Automobile Repair Shop, the Rubber Parts Factory, the Central Machine Factory, and the Steel Plant No. 2, are working hard to save raw materials and utilize waste materials to reduce costs. As a result of research and improvements, the Automobile Manufacturing and Parts Factory can now smelt ten tons of iron with one ton of coke, compared to only three tons under the Kuomintang rule. This ratio of coke to molten iron can be adopted by general electric furnace iron smelting factories for trial implementation. The amount of gasoline used for repairing cars at the Automobile Repair Shop has been reduced from ten gallons per vehicle to seven gallons, saving eighty to one hundred gallons per month. Workers in the boiler room of the Rubber Parts Factory make every effort to ensure thorough combustion in the furnace, reducing coal consumption by more than twenty tons per month compared to the Kuomintang rule, while the supply of steam has actually increased. Workers at the Machine Plant No. 1 have collected a total of twenty-five tons of pig iron blocks and scrap iron materials that have been buried in the ground and discarded in the yard for many years. Workers at the Machine Plant No. 2, who manufacture bicycle frames, save eleven barrels of hard-to-procure white oil per month, worth approximately 44,000 yuan in People's Currency. Workers at the Machine Plant No. 3 use scrap iron wire to make products, saving at least 500 kilograms of good iron wire each month. Workers in the wire drawing department of Steel Plant No. 2 use substandard electrical coil rods to draw iron wire, reducing the loss by nearly one-third.

    天津各公营工厂职工
    多方省原料减低成本
    汽车修理厂每月可省汽油百加仑
    【新华社天津七日电】津市汽车制配厂、汽车修理厂、橡胶配件工场，中央机器厂及钢铁二厂等公营企业职工，努力节省原料，利用废料，以减低成本。汽车制配厂经研究和改进的结果，现在用一吨焦炭能化铁十吨，而在国民党统治时期只能化三吨。此种焦炭融化生铁的比例数量可以供一般用电炉化铁的工厂试行采用。汽车修理厂修车使用的汽油，由每辆十加仑减少到七加仑，每月可节省八十到一百加仑。橡胶配件工场锅炉房工人尽量使炉烧透，每月用煤比国民党统治时期减少二十余吨，而水蒸汽的供应量反比过去增大。机器一厂工人将许多年来埋在土中和丢在院子里的生铁块和废铁料收集起来，共达二十五吨。机器二厂制自行车架的工人一个月节省不易采购的白光油十一桶，约值人民券四万四千余元。机器三厂工人利用废铁丝打造，每月至少能够节省五百公斤好铁丝。钢铁二厂拉丝部工人利用不合格的电乱盘条拉成铁丝，并使损失量减少将近三分之一。
