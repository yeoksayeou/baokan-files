　　Beiping Scientific Workers Gather
  　Collective Cooperation Strengthens Connection with Practice
    Establishment of the Pharmaceutical and Instrument Cooperation Committee
    [Our dispatch] Liberated Beiping's scientific workers have begun to break away from individual laboratories, conducting collective cooperative research, and closely connecting with enterprise departments to achieve the unity of theory and practice. Yesterday (the 22nd), representatives from the Beiping Branch of the Chinese Chemical Society, the Chemistry Institute of the Beiping Research Institute, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Hygiene Experimental Institute, the Mining and Metallurgy Research Institute, the Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Agricultural Chemistry, and Pharmacy departments of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal University, and Fu Jen Catholic University, as well as the Chemical Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company, the Beiping Industrial Experiment Institute, the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the Beiping New Glass Factory, and the First Pharmaceutical Factory, among other agencies and schools, met to discuss collective cooperation in chemical research and the manufacture of experimental chemical reagents. Mr. Zhou Faqi, Director of the Chemistry Institute of the Beiping Research Institute, stated that Chinese scientific workers must first respond to the People's Government's call for developing production and relying on self-reliance. Therefore, he hoped that chemical reagents used by academic research institutions would be manufactured domestically as much as possible. All representatives present agreed. They also proposed close cooperation between academic research institutions and enterprise departments, mutually exchanging and using chemical reagents and instruments to learn from each other's strengths and overcome weaknesses, and to solve the difficulties of independent reagent manufacturing and individual research.
    The meeting resolved: This conference will adopt a system of agency representation, that is, it will be composed of representatives from various agencies, and will be named the "Pharmaceutical and Instrument Cooperation Committee of the Beiping Branch of the Chinese Chemical Society." Secondly, exchange catalogs of all chemical instruments and reagents held by various agencies and schools to understand the specific circumstances of each unit in detail, and liaise with the Enterprise Department and the Ministry of Education to formulate a work plan, begin to manufacture experimental reagents independently, and gain experience for the future chemical industry.
    Various units successively reported on the chemical reagents, instruments, and library equipment of their units, solving some problems on the spot. For example, the representative of the First Pharmaceutical Factory reported that the factory manufactures large quantities of chemical reagents and offers preferential treatment to academic groups, in addition to wholesale prices, discounts and door-to-door delivery. Representatives of various academic institutions present were previously unaware that this was possible, and therefore suffered from the exploitation of intermediary merchants. It was agreed on the spot that the factory would notify relevant agencies of new drugs as soon as they are produced in the future to establish contact. When the representative of the First Pharmaceutical Factory mentioned the factory's need for heat-resistant and acid-resistant glass instruments, the representative of the Beiping New Glass Factory said that the factory's heat-resistant and acid-resistant glass had stopped production due to lack of sales. As a result, both parties resolved supply and demand difficulties at the meeting. The Department of Agricultural Chemistry of Peking University is planning to experiment with the manufacture of insecticides, and the representative of the Agricultural Science Research Institute immediately stated that they could provide manufacturing methods and invited the representative of Peking University to visit the institute to observe the actual manufacturing process. The representative of the Chemical Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company expressed its willingness to facilitate the supply of chemical raw materials produced by the plant. The New Glass Factory requested that researchers from academic research institutions guide and improve the instruments and supplies produced by the factory.
    Finally, the conference believed that (1) it is necessary to fully contact factories, thoroughly understand the equipment and manpower of various agencies, and cooperate. Further investigation and research work is needed. The conference appointed seven units as a temporary investigation team: the Chemistry Institute of the Beiping Research Institute, the Chemical Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company, Fu Jen Catholic University, Tsinghua University, the Beiping Industrial Experiment Institute, and the First Pharmaceutical Factory. The conference will reconvene within a month. It is stipulated that at the second committee meeting, the research team should draft the articles of association and submit an investigation report. For this reason, the research team has decided to meet at the Chemistry Institute of the Beiping Research Institute on the morning of the 29th. (2) This committee is an organization for unity and cooperation to solve problems together. Therefore, not only are the representatives of the invited agencies natural committee members, but relevant agencies that have not received invitations are also welcome to appoint representatives to participate in the work of the committee.

　　北平科学工作者集会
  　集体合作加强连系实际
    成立药品仪器合作委员会
    【本报讯】解放了的北平市科学工作者，开始突破个别实验室，进行集体合作研究，并与企业部门密切联系，取得理论与实践的统一。昨日（二十二日）中国化学会北平分会、北平研究院化学研究所、华北农业科学研究所、卫生实验院、矿冶研究所、北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学、师范大学、辅仁大学的化学系、化工系、农化系、药学系及华北钢铁公司化工厂、北平工业试验所、协和医院、北平新建玻璃厂、第一制药厂等各机关学校的代表开会，讨论关于化学研究的集体合作进行和制造实验化学药品等问题。北平研究院化学研究所所长周发岐先生说，现在的中国科学工作者首先要响应人民政府发展生产、自力更生的号召，因此凡化学学术研究机关所用化学药品，希望尽可能由中国自行制造。在座代表一致同意，大家还提出学术研究机关与企业部门密切合作，互相交换并使用化学药品仪器，以便取长补短，解决单独制造药品和单独研究的困难。
    会上决议：本会议采取机关代表制，即由各机关代表组成，定名为“中国化学会北平分会药品仪器合作委员会”。其次交换各机关学校所有化学仪器、药品的目录，详细了解各单位具体情况，并与企业部、教育部取得联系，拟定工作计划，着手自行制造实验用药品，并为将来的化学工业取得经验。
    各单位相继报告该单位所有化学药品、仪器、图书设备的情况，当场就解决了一些问题。如第一制药厂代表报告该厂制造大批化学药品，优待学术团体，除照批发价外还打折扣及送货上门。在场各学术机关代表过去并不知道能这样作，因此遭受了居间商人的剥削。当场约定该厂以后新出药品随时通知各有关机关，取得联络。而第一制药厂代表说到该厂缺乏耐热、耐酸的玻璃仪器而苦恼时，北平新建玻璃厂代表却说该厂所制耐热耐酸玻璃因卖不出而停止制造，结果会场上双方都解决了供求的困难。北京大学农化系正拟试验制造杀虫剂，农业科学研究所代表立即表示可以提供制造方法，并请北大代表前往该所参观实际制造过程。华北钢铁公司化工厂代表表示愿意便利供给该厂所制化学原料。新建玻璃厂要求学术研究机关研究人员指导并改进该厂所出仪器用品。
    最后，大会认为（一）要充分和工厂取得联系，要彻底明了各机关的设备、人力，合作起来，还需要进一步作调查研究工作，大会推定：北平研究院化学研究所、华北钢铁公司化工厂、辅仁大学、清华大学、北平工业试验所、第一制药厂等七单位为临时调查小组。大会将在一月之内再度召开，规定在第二次委员会开会时，调研小组应当起草章程提出调查报告，为此，调研小组已经决定在二十九日上午在北平研究院化学研究所集会。（二）本委员会是个团结合作共同解决问题的组织，因此，不但已被邀请的各机关代表为当然委员，即未接邀请的有关机关同样也欢迎他们指派代表参加委员会的工作。
