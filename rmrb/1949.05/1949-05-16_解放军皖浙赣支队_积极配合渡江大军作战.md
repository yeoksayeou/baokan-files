Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 14th: The People's Liberation Army Anhui-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Detachment is actively cooperating with the field army crossing the Yangtze River in combat, liberating many towns and vast areas on the borders of Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. After the PLA field army began crossing the Yangtze River, a part of the Anhui-Zhejiang Detachment first surrounded Shangxikou, a major town southwest of Xiuning County, and on the 23rd, killed, wounded, and captured more than 200 members of the Kuomintang Xiuning County Self-Defense Force. One platoon of the detachment, at the cost of only two wounded and two dead, repelled the reinforcements of more than 2,000 men from the pseudo-Anhui Provincial Security Third Brigade. On the 27th, the detachment liberated Xiuning County, famous for its red tea production. On the 28th, a platoon of the detachment, in coordination with various grassroots armed forces, stormed into Huo County and eliminated more than 30 members of the pseudo-county government's special service brigade. On the morning of May 4, the people's local armed forces of Wuyuan County, after annihilating the enemy's 96th Army headquarters and the remnants of two regiments, seized the opportunity to liberate Wuyuan County. Simultaneously with the military offensive, the Anhui-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Detachment launched a powerful political offensive, winning over more than 2,000 men from the pseudo-Anhui Provincial Police Brigade, Tunxi Police Bureau, and Taiping County Security Regiment in Tunxi alone. The pseudo-Huangwan town government and the self-defense force of Xiuning County, with more than 200 people, also surrendered to the local people's armed forces on May 4.
