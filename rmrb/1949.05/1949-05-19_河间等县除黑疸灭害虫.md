[Ji Zhong Electric] Hejian and other counties in Jizhong are currently engaged in a battle against insect pests. In some villages in Hejian, wheat seedlings have black blight. A survey in Xizhuang showed that wheat fields with black blight accounted for one-third. In Tangjiayao, Qing County, 30% of wheat seedlings died from black blight. Fire mites have been found in Anyang in some areas. In the eleventh district of Wen'an, white insects appeared in 520 paddy fields. In the seventh district, 850 mu of sorghum and millet seedlings in the waterlogged land suffered from stem borers. In the junction of Jianguo and Qingcang counties, 51,000 mu of tender leaves of jujube trees were infested with leaf beetles. In response to the above-mentioned disasters, the Jizhong Administrative Office not only sent personnel to the countryside to organize beating but also sent seven agricultural technicians from the farm to Wen'an, Anguo, and other counties to help with the extermination. After discovering the black blight disease in wheat fields, the county committees of Qing County, Hejian, and Anping researched prevention and control methods and conducted inspections. Farms in each county immediately dispatched cadres to the countryside to organize the masses for prevention and control. Anyang established pest control committees at the county, district, and village levels, and the county sent 33 cadres to the villages to provide guidance. After actively releasing water to irrigate wheat in the disaster areas, Anxin has now eliminated the fire mite infestation on 3,500 mu of land. Under the leadership of county and district cadres, Jianguo County has now largely eliminated the leaf beetles on jujube trees.

　　河间等县除黑疸灭害虫
    【冀中电】冀中河间等县，正和虫害进行斗争。河间部分村庄麦苗有黑疸，西庄的调查有黑疸病的麦田占三分之一。青县唐家窑麦苗，因有黑疸病而死的占百分之三十。任何部分地区发现火蛛子。文安十一区五百二十个稻池发生白虫，七区水脱地的高粱谷子苗，八百五十亩生了钻心虫灾。建国、青沧交两县，五万一千亩枣树嫩叶，发生步曲虫。对以上的各种灾害，冀中行政公署除派员下乡组织扑打外，还派农场技术干部七人，到文安、安国等县帮助扑杀。青县、河间、安平，任何县委，在发现麦田黑疸病后，研究了防治方法，并进行检查，各县农场均立即派干部下乡组织群众防治。任何由县到村三级均建立了捕虫委员会，县抽出三十三个干部到村指导。安新在灾区积极放水浇麦后，现已消除了三千五百亩火蛛子虫灾。建国县在县区干部的领导下，现已把枣树的步曲虫大部消灭。
