    【Taiyuan Electric】The Taiyuan City Workers' Symposium, which opened on May 1st, concluded successfully on the 2nd. The workers are filled with boundless confidence in building a new Taiyuan City under the leadership of the Communist Party. Railway worker Han Jinrong said: "The cannons in yesterday's demonstration parade were so impressive! These were all created by our workers. We will continue to make cannons and bullets to support the People's Liberation Army." At the meeting, workers denounced Yan Xishan's atrocities and demanded severe punishment for war criminals. The workers also raised many opinions on the issue of resuming production in Taiyuan. Finally, Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission and Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke and answered the questions raised by the workers. He said: "Regarding the resumption of production, the workers have put forward many valuable opinions, which are all very good. For example, in order to send electricity quickly, they requested the protection of power lines and poles. In order to be able to quickly send people to repair and check the lines in case of accidents, they requested two horse-drawn carts. These are all things that can be done immediately and must be done. The workers' demands for various living issues are also completely reasonable and should be resolved. The lives of the workers must be gradually improved, but this is a more difficult problem than defeating Yan Xishan. It requires even greater efforts from our working class to gradually achieve this. Of course, we have many difficulties now, but life must be better than under Yan Xishan's rule. During Yan Xishan's rule, working hours ranged from twelve to fourteen hours. Generally, it can be reduced to ten hours. In the past, there was no holiday system. In the future, we plan to implement a major holiday system, with one day off every two weeks. As for the expansion of hospitals, the establishment of workers' children's schools, clubs, and reading rooms, etc., we can study them." Regarding the handling of former employees, Comrade Lai Ruoyu said: "We mainly adopt the policy of transformation and education. Those with minor problems can admit their mistakes to the workers. A small number of reactionaries and particularly bad elements, or those who freeload based on connections, will not be hired. Secondly, regarding factory management issues, each factory is preparing to establish a factory management committee, which will include worker participation." After Comrade Lai Ruoyu finished speaking, worker representative Sha Zhenjiang gave a very pleased reply, expressing his gratitude for the Communist Party's concern for the lives of the workers, and determined to strive to shoulder the glorious task of building a new Taiyuan.

    太原职工座谈会圆满结束
    充满信心建设新太原
    市委赖若愚解答各项问题
    【太原电】五一揭幕的太原市各业职工座谈会，已于二日圆满结束。职工们对于在共产党领导下建设新的太原市，充满了无限信心。铁路工人韩金荣说：“昨天参加示威游行的大炮多威风啊，这都是咱们工人创造出来的，我们还要继续做大炮子弹，支援解放军。”会上，职工们纷纷控诉阎匪暴行，要求严惩战犯。职工们又对太原的复工生产问题提出了许多意见。最后由军管会副主任兼中共太原市委书记赖若愚同志讲话，并分别解答职工们所提出的问题。他说：“关于复工生产，工人们提出很多宝贵意见，都是很好的，例如为了迅速送电，要求保护电线电杆，为了在发生意外时能迅速派人去修查线路，要求有二辆马车，这都是马上能办到的，一定要办。工友们提出各种生活问题的要求，也是完全合理的，应该解决。工人的生活必须逐步改善，不过这是比打阎锡山更困难的问题，是要经过我们工人阶级更大的努力才能逐步实现的。当然，现在咱们有很多困难，但是一定要比阎匪统治下生活的好一些。工作时间在阎匪统治时期，有工作十二小时到十四小时的，一般可以减到十小时，过去没有礼拜制，今后准备实行大礼拜制，两礼拜休息一天。至于医院的扩充，工人子弟学校的举办，俱乐部和图书阅览室等可以研究。”关于旧职员处理问题，赖若愚同志说：“咱们主要采取改造教育的方针，有些小毛病的，可向工人承认错误。少数反动分子和特别坏的，或是凭面子吃闲饭的，不准备录用。其次关于工厂管理问题，各厂准备建立工厂管理委员会，吸收工人参加。”赖若愚同志讲话完了，职工代表沙振江非常愉快地致答词，对共产党如此关心工人生活表示十分感谢，决心要努力担负建设新太原的光荣任务。
