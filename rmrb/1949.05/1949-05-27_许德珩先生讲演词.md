[This city news] Mr. Xu Deheng, a representative of the Chinese delegation who returned victoriously from the World Peace Congress, delivered a speech at the welcoming rally in Beiping on the 25th. The original text is as follows:

　　Dear compatriots from all walks of life, it has been exactly fifty-eight days since I left you, and now I am back in Beiping, back in front of you. I am extremely moved by such a warm welcome from you! In these short fifty-eight days, thanks to the arduous efforts of the Chinese people, the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and especially the wise leadership and correct instructions of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, we quickly liberated Nanjing, the nest of reactionary rule for twenty-two years, and liberated Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, and Nanchang, the birthplace of the people's revolutionary armed forces twenty-two years ago... These great victories have enabled our delegation to achieve considerable success abroad, have brought us unparalleled glory, and have raised the international status of the Chinese people to an unprecedented level. First of all, we should pay tribute to the hardworking Chinese working people, pay tribute to the meritorious People's Liberation Army, pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party that leads the Chinese revolution, and even more so, pay tribute to the great and wise people's leader, Chairman Mao!

　　Compatriots, our trip abroad this time was to strive for world peace! Because the war-mongers, financial oligarchs, arms dealers, and remnants of international fascism, headed by the American imperialists, are plotting war. For the benefit of a very few people, they want to drive the majority of good people in the world into a great war slaughterhouse once again. In order to expose the war conspiracies of these war-mongers and fascist remnants, and to review the democratic and peaceful strength of our own people, we held a peace congress in Paris and Prague, demonstrating the immensely powerful strength of the people, exposing the war conspiracies of the warmongers, and making them tremble in the face of this immensely powerful people's democratic force.

　　Compatriots! Striving for world peace and the domestic revolutionary war are consistent, they are one thing, not two. For a hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudal warlords, and bureaucratic comprador capitalists. They often fought among themselves, causing turmoil and making the country poor and weak. For the true peace of the Chinese people and for the progress of the country, these obstacles must be removed, the regime of the US-Chiang reactionary rule must be swept away, and the revolutionary war must be carried through to the end. This is the true peace for China. To strive for lasting peace, we must resolutely carry the Chinese revolutionary war through to the end. We must quickly liberate Guangzhou, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and completely eradicate the roots of the US-Chiang reactionary rule.

　　At the same time, in order to strive for lasting world peace, we must also closely unite with all peace-loving people in the world, including the working people and progressive intellectuals of the imperialist countries of Britain, America, and France, the people of the new democratic countries, and the broad masses of people in the oppressed nations, and unite around the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world democracy and peace. Compatriots! Without the Soviet Union, this bulwark of democracy and peace, the guarantee of world peace is unimaginable.

　　Finally, I would also like to say that in order to be worthy of striving for world peace and to ensure a true guarantee of lasting world peace, we must work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, increase production, strive for scientific research, and quickly transform this backward agricultural country into an industrial country, into a new democratic industrial country, and embark on the road of socialist construction. To strive for the completion of this arduous task, I want to shout:

　　Long live the democratic unity of the Chinese people!
　　Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live the great Soviet people, the world revolutionary teacher Stalin!
　　Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

　　许德珩先生讲演词
    【本市讯】出席世界拥护和平大会胜利归国的中国代表团许德珩代表，二十五日在北平欢迎大会上演讲，原词如下：
    亲爱的各界同胞们，离开了你们到今天已整整的五十八天，现在又回到北平来了，回到你们的跟前来了。承蒙你们这样热烈的欢迎，真是万分的感奋！在这短短的五十八天当中，由于中国人民艰苦的努力，由于中国人民解放军的英勇奋斗，由于中国共产党正确的领导，更由于中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席英明的领导与正确的指示，使我们很迅速的解放了反动统治二十二年的窝子的南京，解放了武汉，解放了杭州，解放了西安，解放了二十二年前人民革命武装诞生地的南昌，……由于这些伟大胜利，使我们代表团这次在国外，收到了相当的成就，使我们受到了无比的光辉，使我们中国人民的国际地位提高到史无先例的地步。这，我们首先应当向艰苦努力的中国劳动人民致敬，应当向劳苦功高的人民解放军致敬，向领导中国革命的中国共产党致敬，更应当向伟大的英明的人民领袖毛主席致敬！
    同胞们，我们这次出国，是为着争取世界和平！因为以美帝国主义者为首的战争贩子、金融寡头、军火商人、国际法西斯余孽，在那里制造战争阴谋，他们为极少数人的利益，想把世界上多数的善良人民再一次驱入一大战争的屠场，我们为揭穿这些战争贩子、法西斯余孽的战争阴谋，检阅我们人民自己的民主和平的力量，我们在巴黎和布拉格举行了拥护和平大会，显示了人民强大无比的力量，揭穿了好战分子的战争阴谋，使他们在这强大无比的人民民主的力量面前发抖。
    同胞们！争取世界和平与国内的革命战争是一致的，它是一件事，不是两件事，中国人民百年以来，受尽了帝国主义、封建军阀、官僚买办资本家的压迫剥削，它们常常互相火并，弄得鸡犬不宁，国家贫弱不堪，为了中国人民的真正和平，为了国家的进步，必须扫除这些障碍，扫除美蒋反动统治的政权，把革命战争进行到底，这样才是中国真正的和平。为争取持久和平，我们必定要坚决地把中国的革命战争进行到底，我们要很快的解放广州、海南岛、台湾，把美蒋反动统治的根子完全铲除。
    同时，为争取世界持久的和平，我们也必定要与全世界上爱好和平的人民，包括英、美、法帝国主义国家的劳动人民、前进知识分子，新民主主义国家的人民，被压迫民族中的广大民众，紧密的团结，团结在世界民主和平堡垒苏联的周围。同胞们！没有苏联这个民主和平堡垒，世界和平的保障也是不可想象的。
    最后我还要说，要够得上争取世界和平，使世界持久和平得到真正的保障，我们必定要努力向苏联学习，增加生产，努力科学研究，把这个落后的农业国家很快的变为工业国家，变成新民主主义的工业国家，走上社会主义建设的道路，为完成这个艰巨的工作而奋斗，我要高呼：
    中国人民民主的团结万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民，世界革命导师斯大林万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
