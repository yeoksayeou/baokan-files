    North China Postal and Telecommunications Administration Decides to Massively Open Parcel Services
    Letters Can Be Sent to Suiyuan-Mongolia and Nanjing
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The North China Postal and Telecommunications Administration has decided to massively open parcel services throughout the region. (1) Starting from May 10th, parcel services will be mutually available with the following 20+ counties under the jurisdiction of Northwestern Shanxi: Zuoyun, Youyu, Huairen, Pinglu, Shuoxian, Datong, Daixian, Guoxian, Ningwu, Yuanping, Jingle, Pianguan, Shenchi, Hequ, Wuzhai, Kelan, Baode, Lanxian, Xingxian, Linxian, Fangshan, Qikou, Liulin, Lishi, Zhongyang, and Shanyin. The weight limit is five kilograms (ten Jin). (2) Starting from May 1st, all counties in Eastern Hebei will also open parcel services. (3) Along the Pinghan, Jincang, Zhengtai, Shide, Tongpu, and Hanzhang Railways, and at bureaus in Jinan, Dezhou, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and Xuzhou in Shandong, the parcel weight limit will be uniformly raised to thirty kilograms; for other locations in Shandong, it will be uniformly raised to fifteen kilograms. (4) The Tianjin and Beijing bureaus have already opened parcel services to Kaifeng, Luoyang, Lanfeng, Zhongmu, Shangqiu, and Mamuji in the Central Plains Liberated Area, and to Hefei, Sucheng, Bengbu, Chuxian, Jiashan, Fengyang, Guzhen, and Mingguang in Central China. It is expected that parcel services will be opened throughout the region in mid-May. (5) All bureaus throughout the region have already begun accepting letters, registered mail, newspapers, and printed matter addressed to Nanjing and Taiyuan, and are also accepting parcels addressed to Taiyuan. Additionally, the following nine post offices in the Suiyuan-Mongolia area have been placed under the leadership of North China: Jining, Zhuozishan, Fengzhen, Taolin, Xinghe, Liangcheng, Helin, Qixiaying, and Longshengzhuang. Letters, registered mail, newspapers, and printed matter can now be mutually sent. Parcel and remittance services are being prepared.

    [Furthermore] A motor vehicle postal route of nearly 500 Li has been established between Zhangjiakou, via Zhangbei, Shangyi, and Shangdu, to Jining, taking two days to complete. Jining connects south to Fengzhen, and west to Zhuozishan and Qixiaying, all by train. From Jining onward, trains depart every other day, requiring two to three days. Starting from April 20th, the section between Chengde and Miyun has also switched to using motor vehicles to transport mail, connecting to the Pingmi section of the Pingcheng Railway, with direct services. Mail from Beiping to Chengde can arrive in two days, doubling the previous speed.

    To improve the speed of postal transport along the Pinghan Railway, the Ministry of Transportation has approved the establishment of a motor vehicle postal transport team by the Highway Administration Bureau. The team will travel directly from Zhuoxian to Handan daily, a total distance of 920 Li, taking three days. Newspapers from Beiping can be seen in Handan in three days.

    Currently, North China's motor vehicle postal routes, including Changzhi to Jincheng, Hengshui to Weixian, Zhangyuan to Zhangbei, Changzhi to Xiangyuan, Handan to Linqing, and Tianjin to Jinan, total eight routes with a combined length of 3,192 Li, connecting dozens of counties. These routes connect upwards to various railway sections and downwards to various horse-drawn carts, bicycles, manual labor teams, and rural postal routes, linking all major and minor cities and villages throughout North China. Efforts are currently being made to overcome the difficulties of motor vehicles being unable to travel during the rainy season. (Xiaochuan)
