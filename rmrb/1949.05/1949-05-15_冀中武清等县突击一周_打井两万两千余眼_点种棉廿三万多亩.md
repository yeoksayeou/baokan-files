    Hebei Central Wuqing and other counties make a week-long push
    Digging over 22,000 wells
    Planting over 230,000 mu of cotton

    [Report from this newspaper] This newspaper reporter Zhao Gang reports: The tenth district of Hebei Central is enthusiastically carrying out well digging and planting to overcome the drought. With the joint efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of the entire district, considerable achievements have been made after seven days of emergency action. From the 30th of last month to the 5th of this month, the entire district has dug 21,845 earth wells and 721 brick wells, totaling 22,566 wells (a very small number of which were dug during the representative meeting on the 24th and 25th of last month). Wuqing County alone dug 8,246 wells, and Ba County dug 5,918 wells. The entire district has now planted 238,051 mu of cotton, accounting for 52.9% of the district's task of planting 450,000 mu of cotton. Wuqing and Shengfang completed the task relatively quickly, with Shengfang exceeding the original task by 14.9%. Wuqing completed slightly more than 68%. Anci and Rongcheng completed the task poorly. Anci only completed 16%, and Rongcheng completed slightly less than 25%. In addition, the entire district has planted 15,049 mu of peanuts. According to statistics from six counties including Ba County, 91,740 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed. According to incomplete statistics from four districts and nine villages in the Anci flood-stricken area, a total of 9,190 mu of large fields have been planted (including 2,620 mu of paddy fields). Currently, farmers in each county are working with great intensity to complete the remaining 210,000 mu of cotton in the entire district, and it is estimated that the task of planting cotton may be completed before the 15th of this month.
    The reasons for achieving the above results in this short seven-day work process are mainly the following: (1) Under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party, a unified leadership organization was established, the inspection and reporting system was strengthened, and more than 2,000 cadres who had withdrawn from production in the entire district were mobilized to invest in leading production, greatly exerting the leading role in carrying out the production movement. For example, joint offices were established at the district and county levels, leading production core groups were established at the district level, and production committees were established at the village level, unifying the control and guidance of the production movement. At the same time, the district and counties have determined key counties, districts, small areas, and villages to learn from experience and guide and drive the overall work. In order to understand the situation in a timely manner and solve the difficulties and deviations that occurred in the movement, the district joint office contacted each county by telephone every day, so that the progress of each county's work, the difficulties and deviations that occurred, and the experience and lessons learned could be quickly understood (the district also set a daily report to the county). New experiences and lessons were immediately reported for commendation and criticism (such as the creation of a method for digging wells in quicksand). Therefore, deviations were corrected, difficulties were solved, and the development of the entire production movement was promoted. (2) Because the masses were mobilized to initially solve the land problem in March this year, the peasants in the whole region were liberated politically and economically, so the peasants' production enthusiasm was greatly improved. For example, after the emergency task of digging wells, planting, fighting drought and preparing for famine was put forward this time, after publicity and mobilization, the peasants in various villages organized mutual aid teams (mostly temporary). According to statistics of the whole district with more than 1,977,700 people, more than 320,300 laborers organized mutual aid teams, especially women who have never participated in field production (especially in the new districts), more than 96,600 have gone to the fields to plant this time, which is an unprecedented initiative in the tenth district. (3) The masses' idea of relying on heaven for food has been initially eliminated, and the erroneous idea of cadres neglecting the leading role of production has been resolved, which is also one of the main keys to achieving results.
    In order to conscientiously implement and complete the task of digging wells, planting, and overcoming drought, on the existing basis, in addition to continuing to seize the task of completing the cotton planting and seize the planting of peanuts or general large fields, we should be highly vigilant about insect plagues and strengthen the protection of seedlings. In areas where insect plagues have been found, the masses should be immediately mobilized to capture and kill them. Areas that can use all water conservancy facilities for irrigation should seize the opportunity to irrigate to prevent insect breeding. In particular, the planted cotton should be irrigated to avoid damage to the cotton seedlings due to drought.

### 冀中武清等县突击一周  打井两万两千余眼  点种棉廿三万多亩

    冀中武清等县突击一周
    打井两万两千余眼
    点种棉廿三万多亩
    【本报讯】本报记者赵刚报导：正在热烈开展着打井点种战胜天旱的冀中十分区，在全区党政军民的齐力动手之下，经过七天的紧急突击，现已获得相当成绩。从上月三十号截至本月五号止，全区已打土井二万一千八百四十五眼，砖井七百二十一眼，共计二万二千五百六十六眼（其中有极少数是在上月二十四五号开代表会时打的）。仅武清一县就打井八千二百四十六眼，霸县打五千九百一十八眼。全区现已点棉二十三万八千零五十一亩，占全区四十五万亩种棉任务的百分之五十二点九。完成较快者为武清、胜芳，胜芳超过原任务百分之十四点九。武清完成百分之六十八强。完成较差的为安次、容城。安次仅完成百分之十六；容城完成百分之二十五弱。另外全分区已点种花生一万五千零四十九亩。据霸县等六个县的统计，抢耕荒地九万一千七百四十亩。仅据安次水灾区四个区九个村的不完全统计：共抢种大田九千一百九十亩（内有稻田二千六百二十亩）。目前全分区尚未完成的二十一万多亩棉花，各县农民正高度紧张的进行突击，估计在本月十五号以前可能全部完成种棉任务。
    在此短短的七天工作过程中，能够获得以上成绩的原因，主要有以下几点：（一）在上级党的正确领导下，建立了统一领导机构，加强了检查汇报制度，动员了全分区二千多个脱离生产的干部投入领导生产，大大发挥开展生产运动的领导作用。如分区、县均建立了联合办公室，区建立了领导生产核心小组，村建立了生产委员会，统一掌握与指导生产运动。同时分区，县、区都确定了重点县、区、小区、村，以此重点领导吸取经验，指导与带动了全面工作。为了及时了解情况，解决运动中发生的困难和偏向，分区联办室每天用电话和各县联系，使各县每天的工作进度，发生的困难和偏向，以及经验教训等都能迅速了解——（区向县亦定每天报告）。对新的经验与教训，即时通报进行表扬与批评（如创造了流砂地打井办法）。因此，纠正了偏差，解决了困难，推动了整个生产运动的开展。（二）由于今年三月间发动群众初步解决了土地问题，使全区农民在政治、经济上获得解放，所以农民生产情绪大大提高。如这次提出打井点种抗旱备荒的紧急任务后，经过宣传动员，各村农民纷纷组织互助组，（大部分是临时性的），据全分区一百九十七万七千七百多人口的统计，就有三十二万三百多个劳力组织起互助组，特别是历来不参加田间生产的妇女（尤其新区），在这次点种中，已有九万六千六百多个到地里点种，这是十分区空前未有的创举。（三）群众靠天吃饭的思想得到初步解除，干部忽视生产领导作用的错误思想得到解决，这也是获得成绩的主要关键之一。
    为认真贯彻与完成打井点种战胜天旱的任务，在现有的基础上，除继续抓紧完成种棉任务与抓紧点种花生或一般大田的点种外，应是高度警惕虫灾，加强保育幼苗。在已发现虫灾地区，应立即发动群众捕灭。能够利用一切水利进行浇地的地区，要抓紧浇地，御防生虫。特别对已点种的棉花，应设法点浇，以免天旱地干棉苗受害。
