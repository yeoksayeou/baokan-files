[From Our Correspondent in Beiping]

　　Mr. Zhang Xiruo, a delegate of the Chinese delegation who attended the victorious World Peace Congress and returned home, gave a speech at the Beiping welcome rally on the 25th. The original text is as follows:

　　The main facts and significance of the World Peace Congress held simultaneously in Paris and Prague have probably been seen by everyone in the newspapers over the past two months. Coupled with the reports just given by Mr. Guo Moruo and Mr. Ma Yinchu, the general outline seems to be clear, so I will not say much about these now. What I want to say are just a few explanations.

　　First, what I want to explain is the nature of this Peace Congress. To put it bluntly, this Peace Congress is a demonstration to the imperialist warmongers. Why is it a demonstration? Because the warmongers have been threatening world peace with various conspiracies and tricks such as the so-called Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and the North Atlantic Treaty over the past two years. We have united the vast number of peace-loving and peace-needing people around the world to give them a clear and loud answer: we oppose war, and we will not allow you to launch a war! If these warmongers, in the unlikely event that they do not appreciate our good intentions and eventually launch a war, then we will prove to them the greatest truth in the world, that is: the power of the people is inviolable. The power of the organized, sacrificing, and idealistic people, united together under strong leadership, is even more inviolable. As I said earlier, the Paris and Prague World Peace Congresses are a demonstration. The meaning of the so-called demonstration lies here.

　　Secondly, what I want to explain is the significance of the success of this Congress. However, the so-called success is only a preliminary success, not a final success; it is only the success of the beginning of unity and the beginning of organization. It does not mean that the war crisis has disappeared from now on. Because it is only the beginning, the arduous work is still ahead. In the future, we must gradually implement the resolutions of the Congress. We must extend the organization for defending world peace to every city, every village, every school, every factory, every organization, and every group in China. Every corner can exert the greatest effect. Only when this force can exert the greatest effect in every corner of China, and at the same time exert the greatest effect in every peace-loving country in the world, can world peace be truly guaranteed, and the warmongers will retreat in the face of difficulties.

　　Finally, what I want to say is the reason why the representatives of various countries, especially the representatives of Czechoslovakia and the people of Czechoslovakia, warmly welcomed the Chinese delegation at and outside the Congress. I feel that simply saying "warm" welcome is not enough. To describe the actual situation even slightly, it can simply be said to be a "mad" welcome. Yes, it was "mad," it was very "mad."

　　Why did they welcome us so madly? I think there are three psychological backgrounds: First, they admired and wanted to warmly celebrate our final defeat of the fascist group headed by Chiang Kai-shek in the long and arduous revolutionary war. Second, they not only admired and celebrated our defeat of the domestic fascist group, but they also admired and wanted to celebrate even more our crushing of all the conspiracies and efforts of the American imperialists to interfere in China's internal affairs and participate in China's civil war. This gave them a very good example and great encouragement, so they welcomed us even more warmly and celebrated even more madly. Third, there is another reason why they welcomed us so warmly and madly, and that is: they welcome the 450 million people of China to join the ranks of defending world peace. This matter seems to them to be extraordinary, and in fact, of course, it is extraordinary. Because the 450 million people of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are indeed a great force in defending world peace. Because it is a great force in defending world peace, they welcomed us even more warmly and madly.

　　Ladies and gentlemen, let other gentlemen speak about other things, my words are finished.

### 北平欢迎和大代表团会上　张奚若先生讲演词

　　北平欢迎和大代表团会上
  　张奚若先生讲演词
    【本市讯】出席世界拥护和平大会胜利归国的中国代表团张奚若代表。二十五日在北平欢迎大会上演讲，原词如下：
    在巴黎和布拉格同时开的世界拥护和平大会的主要事实和意义，这两个月以来大家在报纸上所看见的大概已经不少，再加上方才郭沫若先生和马寅初先生向大家的报告，大致的轮廓似乎已经明了，所以我现在对于这些不预备多说。我所要说的只是几点解释。
    首先我所要解释的是这个和平大会的性质。这个和平大会，老实不客气的说，对于帝国主义的战争贩子们是一种示威。为什么说是示威呢？因为战争贩子们这两年来拿所谓杜鲁门主义，马歇尔计划，北大西洋公约种种阴谋诡计来威胁世界和平，我们便联合全世界上爱好和平，需要和平的广大人民向他们明确地响亮地回答道：我们反对战争，我们不许你们发动战争！假如这些战争贩子们万一不识好歹地终于发动战争，那时我们就要向他们证明天下最大的一个道理，那就是：人民的力量是不可侮的，有组织、有牺牲精神、有理想的人民的力量，在坚强的领导下，一齐联合起来，更是不可侮的。方才说，巴黎和布拉格世界拥护和平大会是一种示威。所谓示威的意义就在这里。
    其次，我所要解释的乃是这个大会的成功的意义。不过所谓成功只是初步的成功，并非最后的成功，只是开始团结、开始组织的成功，并不是说战争危机从此也已经不存在了。因为只是开始，所以艰巨的工作还在后面。以后我们要把大会的决议逐步实施出来，我们要把保卫世界和平的组织推广到全中国每一个城市，每一个乡村，每一个学校，每一个工厂，每一个机关，每一个团体里面去。每一个角落都能发生最大的效力。只有这种力量在全中国每一个角落都能发生最大效力的时候，同时也在全世界上每一个爱好和平的国家里发生最大效力的时候，世界和平才能得到确实的保障，战争贩子们才会知难而退。
    最后我所要说的是这次各国的代表，尤其是捷克的代表和捷克的人民，在大会上和大会以外所以热烈欢迎中国代表团的原因。我觉得仅仅说是“热烈”欢迎，还嫌不够，要描写实际情形于万一，简直可以说是“疯狂”的欢迎。不错，是“风狂”的，是非常“疯狂”的。
    他们为什么要那样疯狂的欢迎我们呢？我觉得有三种心理背景：第一、他们很佩服，并且要热烈庆祝，我们在长期的、艰苦的革命战争中最后打败了以蒋介石为首的法西斯集团。第二、他们不但佩服、庆祝我们打败了国内的法西斯集团，他们更佩服、更要庆祝我们粉碎了美帝国主义者干涉中国内政，参加中国内战的一切阴谋和努力。这给他们一个很好的榜样，很大的鼓励，所以他们对我们更加热烈地欢迎，更要疯狂地庆祝。第三、他所以热烈地疯狂地欢迎我们，还有一个道理，那就是：他们欢迎中国四万万五千万人民参加保卫世界和平的阵容。这一件事在他们看起来确是非同小可，实际上当然也是非同小可。因为在中国共产党的领导之下的四万万五千万人民，的的确确是保卫世界和平一个很大的力量。因为是保卫世界和平一个很大的力量，所以他们更加热烈地疯狂地欢迎我们。
    诸位，别的话让别的先生们说吧，我的话完了。
