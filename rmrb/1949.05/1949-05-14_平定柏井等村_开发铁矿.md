[Jinzhong Electric] Pingding, Baijing Village and surrounding areas are developing mineral resources to supply raw materials for industrial production. In the seventh district of the county, a strip-shaped mountain range stretching approximately sixty li from Xiaoqiaopu and Baijing to Bianguan contains abundant iron ore, and the ore quality is very good. Locals refer to areas where ore is visible at a depth of three chi (one meter) as "turf nests." Although small, these can yield hundreds to thousands of jin (one jin is approximately 0.5kg) of ore. Areas dug to a depth of three zhang (ten meters) are called "grounds" by the locals, and the quality is even better, with each yielding tens of thousands of jin. Some locals have previously dug here, but the ore was sold to nearby private iron furnaces at very low prices, or rejected due to poor quality, so no one developed it. When the district sent cadres to organize the local masses to develop it, everyone's only concern was the fear that no one would buy the ore once it was mined. Therefore, they first organized a few people in Baijing Village to carry out exploratory mining. The director of the district cooperative personally took the ore to the Yangquan State-owned Iron Factory for review, which deemed the ore quality excellent. When the ore was sold and brought back to the village, the masses began to believe that mining had a future and automatically formed groups to carry out mining. By the end of April, Baijing Village had produced 120,000 jin of ore, generating an income of 19,200 jin of millet. Influenced by Baijing Village, the masses in Zhangshenjialing and five other villages also began mining one after another. However, there are still two problems that need to be solved: first, the area consists of mountain paths that are rugged and difficult to navigate. Baijing Village lost a pack animal due to transportation. Therefore, for long-term purposes, it is necessary to organize the masses to build a wide road to facilitate transportation. Second, in addition to organizing the masses to mine during agricultural slack seasons, this mining operation should be specialized, and a strong force should be organized to exploit the resource in order to continuously supply raw materials for industry.

    平定柏井等村
    开发铁矿
    【晋中电】平定柏井村一带开发矿产，供给工业生产原料。该县七区小桥铺、柏并至边关，长约六十余里的一条带形山脉中，隐藏着丰富的铁矿，而且矿质很好，掘三尺深即可见矿者俗称“草皮窝子”，且虽不大可产矿数百至数千斤，掘三丈深者俗称“地”，质量更好，每个可产数万斤，当地群众也曾有人刨过，但煤矿拿到附近私人铁炉上卖，往往价格很低，或以矿质不好拒收，所以无人开发。当该区派干部去组织当地群众开发时，大家唯一的顾虑是怕刨出矿来无人收。于是先在柏井村组织几个人进行试探性的开采，区里们的社长亲自拿着矿石，到阳泉国营铁工厂去审查，认为矿质很好，当将矿石卖出将来拉到村里时，群众才开始相信矿产有出路，自动结成小组进行开采。至四月底柏井村已出产矿石十二万斤，收入小米一万九千二百斤，在柏井村的影响下，张呻家岭等五个村群众亦纷纷进行开采。但目前仍存在着两个问题尚待解决：首先是该地均系山脉小路，崎岖难行，柏井村曾因运输死了一条牲口，所以为长期打算，必须组织群众修建大道，以便利运输。其次，不仅在农间时组织群众开采，而且应将此一矿业开采专业化，组织强大力量开采，以源源供给工业原料。
