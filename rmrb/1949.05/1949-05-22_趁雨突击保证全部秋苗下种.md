Short Commentary:

　　In the vicinity of Beiping, there was a heavy rain for several hours on the night of the 19th, and on the 21st, it was overcast and rainy all day. Jidong, Jizhong and other places have also been thoroughly soaked. Just as various places were tensely fighting drought and sowing seeds, this timely rain has made them even more excited. The following suggestions are hereby put forward, and it is hoped that all localities will urgently mobilize and earnestly implement them:

    1. In rainy areas, concentrate all forces, mobilize and organize the masses to seize the opportunity to rush sow while the ground is still moist. Drawing on past experience, organize the exchange of labor between people and animals. Organs, organizations, troops, and schools in their驻地should do their best to help. Once the sowing is completed,荒地should be immediately investigated and eliminated to ensure that all arable land is sown. In areas where planting cotton and peanuts is not too late, efforts can still be made to continue sowing. If the season has passed, there is no need to force it.

    2. After the seedlings emerge, seize the time to immediately carry out thinning and weeding as early as possible to conserve moisture and prevent drought and荒地. In thinning and weeding, the role of female labor and semi-labor should be brought into play.

    3. Riverine areas should also begin flood prevention inspections; areas where insect pests occur should continue to eliminate insect pests, and pay special attention to the occurrence of locusts and armyworms.

    The above three matters, it is hoped that all localities will immediately mobilize with more intense and greater efforts than fighting drought and sowing to ensure the completion of this task.

### 趁雨突击保证全部秋苗下种

　　趁雨突击保证全部秋苗下种
    北平附近十九日夜大雨数小时，二十一日又阴雨整日，冀东、冀中等地亦已下透，正当各地紧张抗旱下种之际，逢此甘霖，更加兴奋，兹特提出以下意见，希各地紧急动员认真执行：
    一、落雨地区，集中所有力量，动员组织群众趁湿突击抢种。吸收过去经验，组织人畜变工，机关、团体、部队、学校在驻地要尽力帮助，当下种告一段落，应立即进行查荒灭荒，保证全部耕地下种。在种植棉花、花生尚不太晚地区，仍可争取继续播种。如季节已过，即不必勉强。
    二、出苗之后，要抓紧时间即早进行间苗、锄苗，以保存水分，防旱防荒。在间苗锄苗中，要发挥妇女劳力及半劳动力的作用。
    三、沿河地区，并应开始防洪检查；发生虫灾地区，继续扑灭虫灾，特别警惕蝗虫、黏虫的发生。
    以上三事，希各地立即动员起来，用比抗旱下种更紧张更大的力量，保证完成这一任务。（按：此文业经华北人民政府农业部批准代作指示，不另行文）
