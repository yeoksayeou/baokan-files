Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th: The divisive "constitution" concocted single-handedly by the U.S., British, and French blocs was declared effective on the 23rd at the last meeting of the Bonn Parliamentary Council (also known as the Constituent Assembly). All right-wing factions, including the Christian Social Union, the German Party, and many members who previously opposed the Bonn "Constitution," have signed the Bonn "Constitution" under the direction of the U.S. and Britain. However, West German Communist Party representatives Lehmann and Renner both refused to sign. Renner declared: "I will never sign for the division of Germany." The Parliamentary Council has been dissolved after the Bonn "Constitution" was signed by the governors of the West German states and declared effective. The West German Parliamentary Council was formed last year by the U.S., British, and French occupying authorities based on the Second London Six-Nation (including the U.S., Britain, France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) Conference in June last year, including sixty-five political leaders from all sides, most of whom are reactionaries. Its purpose was to formulate a "constitution" that would divide Germany, dismember Germany, and reduce Germany to a U.S. colony. The characteristic of the Bonn "Constitution" is that it stipulates West Germany as a "Federal Republic," giving the main powers to the divided states, while the central government only has secondary powers, in order to facilitate U.S. rule. The Bonn "Constitution" has clauses that blatantly betray German sovereignty, stipulating that certain sovereign rights can be abandoned to participate in the United States of Europe and other international organizations. The Bonn "Constitution" also makes no secret of its fascist nature, stipulating that the government may declare parties that supposedly reform "democratic freedom" illegal, actually guaranteeing the reactionary government's suppression of the people's freedom. In addition, the Bonn "Constitution" stipulates that the West German parliament is bicameral, with upper house members selected by the state governments, and lower house members elected, totaling four hundred, with a term of four years. The president is elected by a joint session of both houses, and the prime minister is elected by the lower house.

The leading body also discussed the activities of the right-winger Romita, believing that the participants in Romita's temporary committee and the so-called "autonomous faction" who issued a declaration under Romita's leadership to promote division have placed themselves outside the ranks of the Italian Socialist Party. The leading body specifically exposed the hypocritical actions of this insignificant minority group to all party members, who talk about democracy but in fact do not recognize the resolutions of the Party Congress. The leading body reminded those party members who voted in favor of Romita's proposal at the Congress that the Congress has expressed its democratic will and strives to maintain party unity, and will give them a certain proportion of seats in the Central Committee, and measures must also be taken in the local party committees and branches that conform to this resolution.

### 西德反动分子在美帝指使下  竟宣布波恩“宪法”生效  雷曼伦奈拒绝签字

    西德反动分子在美帝指使下
    竟宣布波恩“宪法”生效
    雷曼伦奈拒绝签字
    【新华社北平二十五日电】美英法集团一手制造的分裂主义的“宪法”，已于二十三日在波恩议会委员会（又称制宪会议）的未次会议上宣布生效。各右翼党团，包括基督教社会党联盟，德意志党和许多以前反对波恩“宪法”的议员在美英指使下，已在波恩“宪法”上签字。但西德共产党代表雷曼和伦奈均拒绝签字。伦奈宣称：“我决不为分裂德国而签字。”议会委员会在波恩“宪法”经西德各州州长签字宣布生效后已行解散。西德议会委员会是去年由美英法三国占领当局根据去年六月第二次伦敦六国（包括美英法荷比卢）会议组成的，包括各方政治领袖六十五人，绝大部分为反动分子，其目的就在制定一部分裂德国，肢解德国，并沦德国为美国殖民地的“宪法”。波恩“宪法”的特点是规定西德为“联邦共和国”，把主要的权力赋与分裂的各州，中央政府则仅有次要的职权，以便于美国的统治。波恩“宪法”具有显然出卖德国主权的条文，规定可以放弃某些主权以参加欧洲合众国及其他国际组织。波恩“宪法”也毫不掩饰其法西斯的本质，规定政府得宣布所谓改革“民主自由”的政党为非法，实际上保证了反动政府镇压人民的自由。此外，波恩“宪法”规定西德议会为两院制，上院议员由各州政府选派，下院议员由选举产生，共四百人，任期四年，总统由两院联席会议选举，总理由下院选举。
    领导机构也讨论了右派罗米塔的活动，认为罗米塔的临时委员会的参加者和由罗米塔领衔发表宣言力促分裂的所谓“自主派”已自行置身于意大利社会党的队伍之外。领导机构特向一切党员揭露这一微不足道的少数派集团的伪善行动，他们口里谈民主，而事实上却不承认党的代表大会的决议。领导机构提醒那些在大会上投票赞成罗米塔提案的党员说：大会已表示其民主意志，努力保持党的团结，在中央委员会中将予他们以一定比例的席次，在地方党委员会和支部中亦必须采取符合此项决议的措施。
