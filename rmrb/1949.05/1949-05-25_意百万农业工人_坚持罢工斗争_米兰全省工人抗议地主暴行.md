Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th. The strike of one million agricultural workers in Italy is still ongoing. In many places, workers are striking to protest the brutality of landlords at the Midiglia (previously mistakenly translated as Idiglia) farm in Milan province, who massacred farmworkers. The number of workers arrested for holding protest strikes has reached 134, of whom 19 are minors. Under the call of the trade union committee, workers in Milan city and throughout Milan province held a two-hour general protest strike from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 21st. The Milan City Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting after the strike and resolved to protest police brutality, demand the arrest of the murderers, the release of the arrested strikers, and the disbandment of the so-called "General Labor Federation" established by the landlords' association to undermine the strike. Conflicts between striking workers and strike breakers and the police continue to occur. On the 21st, conflicts occurred in Cremona, Bergamo, Pizzighettone, Verona, and the Minervino Murge area of Apulia.

    【新华社北平二十四日电】意大利一百万农业工人的罢工仍在坚持中。多处工人为抗议米兰省米第利亚（以前误为伊第利亚）农场主残杀农场工人的暴行而罢工。因举行抗议罢工而被捕的工人已达一百三十四人，其中十九人尚未成年，米兰全市及米兰全省工人在工会委员会号召下于二十一日上午十时至十二时举行了两小时的抗议总罢工。米兰市各业工会理事会在罢工后举行会议，决议抗议警察暴行，要求逮捕杀人凶手，释放被捕罢工者，解散地主联合会为了破坏罢工而建立的所谓“劳工总会”。罢工工人与罢工破坏者及警察之间的冲突不断发生。二十一日在克林莫纳、贝加摩、皮赞隆未罗那与阿蒲里亚的明纳文诺——穆基地区都发生了冲突。
