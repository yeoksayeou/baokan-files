    Moscow People's Grand Demonstration
    Millions of Flags Flutter Over Red Square
    Red Flags Display the Great Achievements of the Soviet People
    As soon as the parade ended, processions of tens of thousands of people poured through Red Square. Workers from twenty districts of Moscow marched in formation across Red Square. Millions of silk and velvet flags fluttered in the air. Portraits of Comrade Stalin and his closest comrades-in-arms waved above the marching ranks. The people of Moscow warmly congratulated the beloved leader of the Soviet people. Athletes from the capital led the processions from various districts of Moscow. Tens of thousands of young men and women marched by in light sportswear. Workers from the Stalin district marched solemnly past Lenin's Mausoleum, carrying bright flags emblazoned with figures representing the remarkable labor achievements they had created to add to the glory of the Soviet motherland. The industry of the Stalin district had already completed the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule in terms of production level. Members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and personnel from its affiliated research institutes walked at the forefront of the Lenin district's contingent. Scarlet flags proclaimed the superiority of Soviet science and its achievements, along with slogans about the increase in the number of Soviet intellectual cadres. Workers followed the scientists' procession. Powerful socialist Moscow is playing a leading role in the Soviet people's labor movement to restore and develop the Soviet national economy and culture. Bands continued to play in Red Square. Tens of thousands of workers from factories and manufacturing plants, employees from Moscow's agencies, and students were moving forward. Soviet intellectuals, writers, actors, and architects marched past Lenin's Mausoleum. Young people accounted for a large proportion of the demonstrators. Young men and women wore light summer clothes and carried bouquets of flowers. Workers from the Ministry of Agriculture held red banners displaying the progress of the Stalin plan for the transformation of nature.
    The May Day mass demonstration provided convincing proof of the Soviet Union's labor achievements in the post-war years, and it is a symbol of the strength, power, and unity of the Soviet people. On May Day, the Soviet people expressed their willingness to tirelessly fight for world peace, for the further prosperity of the Soviet Union, for a new and powerful surge in the national economy, and for the welfare of the working people. The May Day demonstration lasted about five hours.
    In addition to the enthusiastic celebrations in Moscow, the working people of Kyiv commemorated May Day with new production achievements. One hundred enterprises exceeded pre-war levels in various outputs. More than one hundred and twenty factories, large and small, completed their first four-month production targets for the year ahead of schedule. The Kyiv garrison marched in formation on the city's thoroughfares. The great parade of the working people continued for three hours.
    In Baku, the oil center of the Soviet Union, 300,000 workers participated in the May Day parade.
