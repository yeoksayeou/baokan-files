Suiyuan-Mongolia Workers Actively Produce to Support the Front

[Suiyuan-Mongolia Electric] Workers in both public and private enterprises in Suiyuan-Mongolia are actively producing to support the front in anticipation of "May Day," and have achieved success. After rectification and the establishment of a trade union, the No. 1 Public Flour Mill increased its output of naked oat and white flour by more than 800 jin compared to before. In addition to their intensive production, the employees also guaranteed two hours of study every day and held a work-life review meeting once a week. Employees of the machinery group small factory under the Construction Department of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Government, using scrap iron, rushed to cast a large pot capable of holding twenty boxes of soap before "May Day" so that the Suiyuan-Mongolia Soap Factory could start production quickly. Workers on the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway raced against time to repair the railway between Fengzhen and Datong, completing the project in two days and one night, which was originally planned for three days and three nights.

    绥蒙工人积极生产支前
    【绥蒙电】绥蒙公私企业产业工人，迎接“五一”，积极生产支前，均获成效。公营面粉第一厂经过整顿，成立工会后比前增磨莜、白面八百多斤。职工们在紧张的生产外，每天还保障了两小时学习，每周还开工作生活检讨会一次。绥蒙政府建设处机械组小工厂职工，利用废铁在“五一”前赶铸出容二十箱肥皂的大锅一口以便绥蒙肥皂厂能很快开工。平绥铁路西段职工，昼夜抢修丰镇至大同间的铁路，原拟三天三夜的计划，两天一夜即抢修完竣。
