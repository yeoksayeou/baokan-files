　　McCloy
  　Appointment as U.S. High Commissioner for Germany is at the Behest of the Consortium
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th] New York dispatch: The Compass publishes a dispatch from its Washington correspondent Stone, stating that the appointment of McCloy as the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany represents a victory for the Rockefeller and Standard Oil companies. Stone writes: The appointment of Black to succeed McCloy as president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is another victory for Standard Oil. The law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hope & Hadley, of which McCloy is a member, is legal counsel to Chase Bank. (Stone calls Chase Bank "the Wall Street branch of the Standard Oil trust.") Stone recalls that Black was the first vice president of Chase Bank, which was a major financial agent of the Hitler regime and a financial pillar of the oil enterprise consortium connected with IG Farben (Germany's largest chemical industrial monopoly). Stone also states: The dismissal of Dr. Collison, deputy director of the decartelization division, and the previous dismissal of another decartelization official, Sachs (both of whom exposed the U.S. authorities' obstruction of decartelization work), and McCloy's appointment this time, indicate that the power of the cartels has been strengthened with approval. Stone emphatically states that Chase Bank has close ties with German industry, and the authorities of Chase Bank "never lost contact" with Hitler's Germany.

  　任美驻德高级专员是财阀的授意　
    【新华社北平二十五日电】纽约讯：指南针日报发表其驻华盛顿记者史东的通讯称：任命麦克洛埃为美国驻德高级专员一事，表示洛克菲勒公司与美孚油公司的胜利。史东写道：任命布莱克继麦克洛埃为国际复兴开发银行的总裁，是美孚油公司的另一胜利。由米德兰、推德霍普、哈德莱与麦克洛埃组成的律师事务所，是大通银行的法律顾问。（史东称大通银行是“美孚油托辣斯的华尔街分行”）史东回溯称，布莱克是大通银行的第一副总裁，大通银行曾是希特勒政权的主要财政代理机关，是与法尔本工业（德国最大的化学工业独占组织）有联系的石油企业组合的金融支柱。史东又称：德境美国军政府解散卡迭尔部副部长柯立森的免职和前此另一名解散卡迭尔部人员萨克斯的解职事宜（他们两人都曾揭露美国当局妨碍解散卡迭尔工作），以及这次麦克洛埃的任命，表示赞成卡迭尔的力量业已加强。史东力称，大通银行与德国工业有密切联系，大通银行的当局与希特勒德国“从未失掉联系”。
