Friends, Comrades, honored guests:

Our First National Congress of the All-China Youth, on the thirtieth anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement – China's Youth Day, in China's ancient capital and the birthplace of the youth movement – Beiping, is officially declared open.

At this congress, we have youth representatives from cultural, scientific, artistic, musical, dramatic, woodcut, and cartoon fields; youth representatives, combat heroes, and people's meritorious workers from the army, navy, and air force; youth militia heroes and production labor heroes; youth model workers; representatives of young workers, farmers, students, engineers, teachers, doctors, nurses, and staff; representatives of youth from various democratic parties; representatives of the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations; youth representatives from all regions of the country and from the Southeast, Southwest, South China, and Taiwan areas still under the remnant rule of the Kuomintang, as well as representatives of overseas Chinese youth; and youth representatives of different nationalities within China, such as Hui, Mongolian, and Korean.

This congress is a victorious gathering of Chinese youth, an unprecedented great unity of Chinese youth. This is the true realization of the democratic unity that our Chinese youth have striven for and long awaited for many years! This is the result of the joint struggle of the Chinese people and Chinese youth, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao, and the valiant and bloody battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Our congress pays tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army! We pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Since the "May Fourth" Movement, Chinese youth have gone through the Northern Expedition, the Land Revolution War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the ongoing People's Liberation War in the new-democratic revolutionary struggle in China. In these struggles, Chinese youth have made their greatest efforts, shed their blood, and written glorious historical pages. Our famous youth leaders Yun Daiying, Zhang Tailei, Xiao Chunu, and Zou Taofen, outstanding young cadres Yang Xuecheng, Zhong Xiaopei, Pu Yunzhao, Ji Yuxiu, and Wang Xiaodong, as well as comrades Yu Ran, Pan Yan, Xun Jizhong, Li Lulian, and Yu Zisan, who were murdered by the Kuomintang in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for fighting for democracy and freedom, all sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries! Countless outstanding young people of ours have heroically sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle! I propose that everyone stand and observe a moment of silence.

Chinese youth have undergone various struggles for the liberation of the nation and the people, and have also experienced various struggles to realize their own unity. Just in the last ten years or so, we have gone through the following tortuous paths. During the anti-Japanese struggle in 1935, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League proposed the unity of the national youth. This call received a wide response in the "December 9th" Movement. In 1936, in order to promote the unity of national youth, the Communist Youth League was changed to the Youth National Salvation Association. In 1937, a youth representative conference was held in Yan'an, and the Northwest Youth National Salvation United Association was established; and officially proposed to all Chinese youth: the National Youth National Salvation Program and Organizational Charter. In 1938, the second youth representative conference was held in Yan'an, and further concrete measures for the unity of national youth were proposed; and in order to promote the unity of national youth, the Joint Office of the All-China Youth Organizations was established. In 1942, the All-Liberated Area Youth Anti-Fascist Representative Conference was held. In 1947, a youth work representative conference was held, and the China Liberated Area Youth Federation was officially established. In March of this year, the Liberated Area Youth Federation and the All-China Student Federation jointly convened the 14th National Student Congress; and established a unified national student federation including the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the Liberated Areas. In April of this year, the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League was held, and the report, program, league charter were adopted, and the central committee of the league was elected. After these complex preparatory steps, we have achieved today's grand gathering.

Comrades! Friends! Now the People's Liberation Army has victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and liberated Nanjing. The whole country is about to achieve complete liberation. The goal that our Chinese youth have strived for for thirty years—to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China—is about to be fully realized. The new task—the task of building a new democratic China—has been placed before every Chinese youth. Therefore, our First National Congress of the All-China Youth convened today has special significance. From this congress onwards, we will unite more closely and advance with unified steps and unified action towards a common goal—building a new democratic society. We will better exert the great role of youth in the struggle to continue to completely complete the people's revolutionary cause and in the construction of new China. We will use the unity of Chinese youth to promote the unity of the youth of the oppressed nations in the East, and strive for the independence, liberation, democracy and freedom of our own nation! We will also work with the democratic youth of the world to contribute the greatest strength of our Chinese youth to the struggle for lasting world peace and people's democracy.

At this congress, we will sum up the experience of the youth movement in the past, stipulate the basic tasks of the Chinese youth movement in the future, listen to the reports of Chinese youth participating in the international democratic youth movement in recent years, and formulate plans to strengthen international activities in the future. We will establish a unified national youth organization, formulate its charter and elect its leading body—the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth. Our congress will declare to the youth of the world: We Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, have won victory and are marching towards greater victory!

We shout:

Strive for the complete victory of the people's revolution!

Strive for the construction of a new democratic China!

Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Long live the unity of all Chinese youth!

Long live the unity of all the youth of the world!

    全国青代大会上
    冯文彬同志的开幕词
    各位朋友、各位同志、各位来宾：
    我们中华全国青年第一次代表大会，在“五四”运动的三十周年纪念日——中国青年节日，在中国的古都和青年运动的发祥地——北平，正式宣告开幕了。
    我们这次大会，有青年的文化、科学、艺术、音乐、戏剧、木刻、漫画工作者；有海陆空军中青年的青年代表及战斗英雄和人民功臣，有青年的民兵英雄和生产劳动英雄；有青年模范工作者；有青年工人、农民、学生、工程师、教师、医生、护士、职员、记者的代表；有各民主党派的青年代表；有基督教男女青年会的代表；有来自全国各个地区与尚在国民党残余统治下的东南、西南、华南、和台湾的青年代表，以及华侨青年代表；有中国境内的回、蒙、朝鲜等不同民族的青年代表。
    这次大会是中国青年的胜利的大会合，是中国青年空前的大团结。这是我们全中国青年所多年来努力的和久已盼待的民主团结愿望的真正实现！这是我们中国人民和中国青年共同奋斗的结果，这是由于中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席的正确领导，中国人民解放军的奋勇血战的结果。我们大会向中国共产党和中国人民解放军致敬！向毛主席和朱总司令致敬！
    中国青年自“五四”运动以来，在中国新民主主义的革命斗争中，经历了北伐战争、土地革命战争、抗日战争以及目前尚在进行的人民解放战争。在这些斗争中，中国青年尽了最大的努力，洒流了自己的鲜血，写下了光荣的史页。我们著名的青年领袖恽代英、张太雷、萧楚女、邹韬奋等同志，卓越的青年工作干部杨学诚、钟筱培、蒲云照、纪毓秀、王晓东等同志以及在国民党统治区为民主争自由、被国民党所残杀的于冉、潘琰、荀极中、李鲁连、于子三等同志，他们都在反抗日寇和国民党反动派的斗争中牺牲了！我们无数的优秀青年，在革命斗争中英勇地牺牲了！我提议：大家起立默念。
    中国青年为了民族的和人民的解放，曾经经历种种的奋斗，为了实现自己的团结，也曾经经历种种的奋斗。只就近十来年说，我们就走过以下的曲折的道路。在一九三五年的抗日斗争时期，中国共产主义青年团中央委员会就提出全国青年的团结，这个号召，在“一二九”运动中得到了广泛的响应；一九三六年，为了促进全国青年的团结，共产主义青年团改变为青年救国会；一九三七年，在延安召开了青年代表大会，成立了西北青年救国联合会；并正式向全中国青年提出了：全国青年救国纲领与组织章程；一九三八年，在延安召开第二次青年代表大会，更进一步提出了全国青年团结统一的具体办法；并为了促进全国青年的团结，建立了中华青年团体联合办事处；一九四二年，召开了全解放区青年反法西斯代表大会；一九四七年，召开了青年工作代表会议，正式成立了中国解放区青年联合会；今年三月，解放区青年联合会与中国学联共同召开了全国学生第十四届代表大会；成立了包括国统区解放区统一的全国学联会；今年四月，召开了新民主主义青年团全国第一次代表大会，通过了报告、纲领、团章、产生了团的中央委员会。经过了这些复杂的准备步骤，我们才实现了今天的盛大的会合。
    同志们！朋友们！现在人民解放军已胜利地渡过长江，解放了南京，全国即将获得完全解放，我们中国青年三十年来努力奋斗的目标——推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，即将完全实现，新的任务——建设新民主主义中国的任务，已摆在我们每个中国青年的面前。因此，我们中华全国青年第一次代表大会在今天召开，有特别重大的意义。我们从这次大会以后，将更紧密地团结一致，以统一的步伐，统一的行动，为着共同的目标——建设新民主主义的社会——奋斗前进；将使全国青年在继续彻底完成人民革命事业的斗争中，在新中国的建设中，更好地发挥青年的伟大作用，我们要以中国青年自己的团结去促进东方各被压迫民族青年的团结，为争取自己民族的独立解放和民主自由而奋斗！我们更要同世界的民主青年一道，共同为争取世界持久和平与人民民主的斗争中贡献我们中国青年的最大的力量。
    在这次大会中，我们要总结过去青年运动的经验，规定今后中国青年运动的基本任务，要听取这几年来中国青年参加国际民主青年运动的报告，并定出今后加强国际活动的计划；要成立全国青年统一组织，制定它的章程与选举出它的领导机构——中华全国民主青年联合总会。我们大会要向全世界青年宣言：我们中国青年在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛主席领导之下，已经获得了胜利，并向着更伟大的胜利迈进！
    我们高呼：
    争取人民革命彻底胜利！
    为新民主主义中国的建设而奋斗！
    毛主席朱总司令万岁！
    全中国青年团结万岁！
    全世界青年团结万岁！
