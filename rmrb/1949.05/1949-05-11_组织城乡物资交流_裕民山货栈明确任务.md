    Organize Urban-Rural Material Exchange
    Yumin Mountain Goods Station Clarifies Tasks
    [Chahar News] How to organize urban and rural material exchange in a planned and organized way, and reduce exploitation by merchants? The Pingxi Special Region and the Beijing Trading Company branch provided some important experiences in running the Yumin Mountain Goods Station. Since its opening, the Yumin Mountain Goods Station has been loved and welcomed by the vast number of peasants, and its business has been developing rapidly. In order to further develop its business, the Pingxi Special Region and the Beijing Trading Company branch held a meeting on April 17th to study the work of the goods station, and determined to first grasp the urban and rural production situation in terms of organization and personnel, that is, each county in Pingxi would send a cadre who is familiar with the production and sales of mountain goods in the county to work at the mountain goods station, and the Beijing Trading Company branch would send a cadre from each of its branches (such as cloth, oil and salt, grain, etc.) to work at the mountain goods station, in order to grasp the urban and rural material exchange. In this way, the basic tasks of the mountain goods station were determined as: purchasing mountain goods produced by farmers (dried and fresh fruits, medicinal materials, mountain goods, etc.) and supplying farmers with daily necessities (cloth, salt, matches, kerosene, soap, grain, etc.), reducing exploitation by merchants from aspects such as low handling fees, fair weights and measures, and reasonable prices, improving urban-rural relations. At the same time, the export of mountain goods can also concentrate foreign exchange power. Therefore, the determined purchasing policy is one that can be sold (sold for export, sold in the city), and one that is convenient for farmers to produce. In terms of funds, in addition to the fixed funds stipulated to be shared by the trading company and the Pingxi Special Region, if there is a large batch of mountain goods that the mountain goods station cannot handle, the trading company will fully assist. The goods station will also establish a deposit relationship with the Beijing People's Bank, and can overdraw when necessary to meet emergency needs. Regarding leadership issues, in addition to the work plan and summary for a certain period of time being jointly discussed and guided by the trading company and the Pingxi Special Region, all other specific leadership is entirely the responsibility of the trading company branch. The trading company will transport part of the daily necessities of its various branches to the mountain goods station to meet the needs of farmers selling mountain goods. If farmers need bulk goods, the mountain goods station will introduce them to the Beijing Trading Company branch for wholesale purchase, and retail goods will be sold by the mountain goods station on consignment.
    [Another News] The original Yumin Mountain Goods Transfer Station at Chengzizhan Station in Mentougou has been merged into the Beijing Yumin Mountain Goods Station as the Chengzi Branch, so that farmers in the Wanping Mountain area near Chengzi can transport mountain goods to the Chengzi Branch. The branch can be responsible for summarizing and transporting them to Beijing. After farmers buy goods in Beijing, they hand them over to the Yumin Mountain Goods Station, and the goods station is responsible for summarizing and transporting them to Chengzi, which is both convenient and safe. This method can be used as a reference for other counties.

    组织城乡物资交流
    裕民山货栈明确任务
    【察哈尔讯】如何有组织有计划的组织城乡物资交流，减轻商人中间剥削，平西专署与北平贸易分公司在举办裕民山货栈中，提供了若干重要经验。裕民山货栈自开业以来，即受到广大农民的爱戴与欢迎，业务日趋发达，为了更进一步开展业务，平西专署与北平贸易分公司特于四月十七日集会研究货栈工作，确定首先从组织上，人事上，把城乡生产情况掌握起来，即平西各县各抽一个对本县山货产销情况熟习的干部来山货栈工作，北平贸易分公司则于所属各分公司（如纱布、油盐、粮食等）各抽一干部到山货栈工作，以便掌握城乡物资交流。这样就确定了山货栈的基本任务是：收购农民所生产的山货（干鲜果品、药材、山货等）供给农民日用必需品（布、盐、火柴、煤油、肥皂、粮食等），从取手续费低廉，秤头、价格公道等方面来减轻商人中间剥削，改善城乡关系，同时山货出口，还可集中外汇力量，因之确定收购的方针，一个是能销（销出口，销本市），一个是农民便于生产。资金方面，除固定资金规定由贸易公司与平西专署双方分担外，如有大批山货，山货栈吞吐不了时，由贸易公司全力帮助：货栈并将与北平人民银行建立存放关系，必要时可透支以应急需。关于领导问题，除一定时期的工作计划、总结由贸易公司及平西专署双方互相商定指导外，其他一切具体领导等完全由贸易分公司负责，贸易公司，将把所属各分公司之日用必需品运到山货栈一部，以应出售山货农民之需，农民需要成批货物，由山货栈介绍到北平贸易分公司批购，零售货物，则归山货栈代销。
    【又讯】原门头沟城子车站裕民山货转运站，已并入北平裕民山货栈，作为城子分栈，使靠近城子的宛平山区农民山货运到城子分栈，分栈即可负责汇总运到北平，农民由北平买好货后，交给裕民山货栈，货栈又负责汇总运到城子，既省事，又稳妥，这一方式，可为其他县参考。
