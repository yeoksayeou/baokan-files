    Steel and Concrete Turns to Rotten Gruel
    ——The Bandit Troops on Wohu Mountain Fortress in Taiyuan Surrender Their Guns
    On the early morning of April 22nd, the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on two of the strongest fortress strongholds on the outskirts of Taiyuan – Shuangta Temple and Huangjiafen simultaneously. Huangjiafen, also known as Wohu Mountain, resembled a tiger squatting on the top of the fortress mountain three miles northeast of the city, guarding the entire fortress north and east of the city from a commanding position. It stretched seven miles from east to west and three miles from north to south, almost entirely covered with sloping terrain, trenches, secret passages, barbed wire, deer寨 (a kind of wooden fence), and densely layered steel and concrete pillboxes in the shape of plum blossoms, chevrons, and prone and high positions... The Yan bandit troops had painstakingly worked on construction here for a full four years. After the Lunar New Year, they drove tens of thousands of hungry citizens every day to urgently work on it, attempting to create a permanent fortress that was impervious to both artillery fire and explosives.

    The Yan bandit troops defending the area included the 46th Division, which had suffered a devastating blow at Shangzitou, as well as the Iron Blood Division and the 40th Division, totaling more than 5,000 men. The commander-in-chief was Cao Guozhong, the commander of the 19th Army. It should be particularly pointed out that he was still the commander of the 40th Division last November. During the battle for Dongshan, he faithfully implemented the Yan bandit's brutal "August 23rd Order," using execution knives to force his officers and soldiers to serve the Yan bandits. As a result, out of 140 platoon leaders in the entire division, only seven remained; out of 44 company commanders, only two remained, and almost all the soldiers were killed. However, he earned the trust of the Yan bandits with the lives of countless officers and soldiers, exchanged for his own promotion, and jumped to the rank of army commander.

    Whether it was the bandit leader Yan Xishan, who had already fled to Nanjing, or the bandit leaders Sun Chu and Wang Jingguo, hiding in the "Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters" bunkers, they all believed that Wohu Mountain was impregnable. They believed in the strong steel and concrete fortifications and in the "brave and resolute" army commander Cao Guozhong. However, after our heroic People's Liberation Army converged under the city of Taiyuan, and after other outlying strongholds were captured by the People's Liberation Army that suddenly penetrated deep, the steel and concrete of Wohu Mountain similarly lost their effectiveness and turned into rotten gruel.

    Around seven o'clock, the People's Liberation Army broke through from Fuxing Gully in the south. Then, the northwest corner was also breached. The telephone lines to the city were also cut off. The originally confident Yan bandit army commander, division commander, and political director became impatient and began holding an emergency meeting in the command post.

    "Please consider fighting to the death or finding another way out," the lanky Cao Guozhong asked in a low voice, looking around at the people. This army commander, who had been so "resolute" just a few months ago, wavered. He knew that he could no longer control his troops, and he knew that even if he used the most brutal supervisory teams to force the soldiers to sell their lives, the fleeing Yan Xishan would not give him a higher rank. People looked at each other in silence – "Let's lay down our weapons, everyone thinks so, but no one wants to say it first."

    "Let's emulate Fu Zuoyi." Wu Shiquan, the commander of the 68th Division, opened his mouth. He had just escaped with his life from the battle of Shangzitou, knowing that time was tight and that further delays would lead to annihilation. Peng Dengwang, the army's political director, said, "It's better to break out of the city." But he himself did not have the courage to break out, and after saying that, he lowered his head and said, "We can't escape. Dying without a cause is a waste. Let's emulate Fu Zuoyi!" Zhao Xianzhu, the commander of the Iron Blood Division, supported Wu Shiquan. They all agreed. So it was decided to send staff officers Xu Yusheng, Wang Shiying, and Chen Da to make contact. However, the soldiers did not wait for the hesitant and indecisive commanders to emulate Fu Zuoyi, but instead realized their wish for peace themselves, laying down their weapons and ceasing resistance. Some people automatically jumped out of the steel and concrete pillboxes, shouting, "Surrender our guns to the People's Liberation Army!" Company and platoon leaders initially suppressed and stopped them, then turned into leading the surrender. A political instructor from a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army led two squads and inserted themselves directly into the gully near the command post. The Iron Blood Division's reserve battalion and the army's signal battalion in the gully immediately panicked. Many citizens who had just been conscripted shouted loudly, "We want peace! We want to surrender our guns!" In this way, two squads solved two battalions, and attacked the command post. At this time, Cao Guozhong and Zhao Xianzhu also led several units near the Iron Blood Division to collectively lay down their weapons. The remaining enemies fell into extreme chaos, completely lost their resistance, and were annihilated in companies and platoons, or collectively laid down their weapons. The People's Liberation Army surged up on all routes. Before nine o'clock, they completely occupied this strongest fortress. At this time, another People's Liberation Army also captured Shuangta Temple in the southeast of the city and captured Liu Youzeng, the commander of the 43rd Army, alive.

### 钢骨水泥成了糠谷稀泥——太原卧虎山要塞匪军缴枪记

    钢骨水泥成了糠谷稀泥
    ——太原卧虎山要塞匪军缴枪记
    四月二十二日清早，解放军对太原外围两个最强固的要塞据点——双塔寺和黄家坟同时开始了猛攻。黄家坟又叫卧虎山，因为它象只老虎蹲踞在城东北角三里的要塞山顶上，居高临下地屏障着城北和城东整个要塞。东西纵深七里；南北纵深三里，几乎无处不是劈坡、壕沟、暗道、铁丝网、鹿寨和密密层层钢骨水泥的梅花碉、人字碉、伏地碉、高碉……。阎匪在这里煞费苦心地从事修筑已经整整有四年之久；阴历年后，又每日驱赶着上万饥饿的市民紧急加工，企图造成一座既不怕炮火，又不怕炸药的永久要塞。
    担任防守的阎匪，除曾在上子头受过歼灭性打击的四十六师外，还有铁血师和四十师，共五千多人。总指挥是十九军军长曹国忠。应该特别指出，他去年十一月还是四十师师长，在东山争夺战中，他曾忠实执行阎匪残暴的“八月二十三日手令”，用执法刀逼迫所属官兵，为阎匪卖命。结果，全师一百四十个排长，只剩了七个；四十四个连长，只剩了两个，士兵几乎全部打光了。但他却以无数官兵的生命博得阎匪的信任，换到自己的官阶，一跃而为军长了。
    无论是早已逃到南京的匪首阎锡山，或者是躲在“绥署”地洞里的匪首孙楚、王靖国，都相信卧虎山是不可攻打的，他们相信那强固的钢骨水泥工事，相信那“勇猛坚决”的军长曹国忠。然而，当我各路英勇的人民解放军在太原城下会师之后，当外围其他要点都被突然插入纵深的解放军攻占之后，卧虎山的钢骨水泥同样也失去了作用，变成了糠谷稀泥。
    七点多钟，解放军就从南边复兴沟突进去了。接着，西北角也突进去了。通城里的电话线也被切断了。原来很自信的阎匪的军长、师长、政治主任们沉不住气了，在指挥所里开始举行紧急会议。
    “请大家考虑死拚，还是另找活路。”瘦长的曹国忠用低沉的声音问着环视着周围的人。这个几个月前还那么“坚决”的军长动摇了，他知道他已经控制不住自己的部队，他知道使即用再残暴的督战队逼迫士兵卖命，逃之夭夭的阎匪锡山也不可能给他更高的官阶了。人们在沉默中面面相视——“放不武器吧，谁也这样想，但是谁也不愿意先说。
    “仿效傅作义吧”。六十八师师长武世权开口了，他刚刚从上子头战斗中逃出性命，知道时间很紧迫，再拖延又要被歼灭了。军政治主任彭登望说：“还是冲出城好”。但他自己也并没有冲出去的勇气，说完就低下了头说：“跑是跑不掉了，没有代价的死是白死，还是仿效傅作义吧！”铁血师师长赵显珠支持武世权，他们都同意了。于是决定派参谋许雨生、王士英、陈达出去联络。但是士兵们不等待犹豫迟疑的长官们去仿效傅作义，就自己来实现和平的愿望，纷纷放下武器，停止抵抗了。有的人自动从钢骨水泥的碉堡里跳出来，喊叫着：“向解放军交枪。”连长、排长起初是镇压制止，接着就变成率领交枪了。解放军某团一位指导员带着两个班，一直插到指挥所附近的沟里，沟里的铁血师预备队一个营和军通讯营立刻惊慌起来。许多才被抓来当兵的市民首先举手大声叫道：“我们要和平！我们要交枪！”这样，两个班就解决了两个营，攻入指挥所。这时，曹国忠、赵显珠也带领铁血师附近的几个部队集体放下武器，其余敌人都陷入极度混乱，完全丧失了抵抗力，成连、成排的被歼，或者集体放下武器。解放军分路蜂踊而上。九点钟前就完全占领了这个最坚固的要塞。这时候，另路解放军也攻占了城东南的双塔寺，活捉了四十三军军长刘有曾。
