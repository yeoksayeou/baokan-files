　　Wuxi and Northern Jiangsu Exchange Industrial and Agricultural Products
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 17th] Wuxi city's industrial products have begun to be exchanged with Northern Jiangsu's agricultural products. The state-owned Lianghuai Trading Company and the Northern Jiangsu Trade Administration have successively transported soybean oil, soybean cakes, cottonseed, and white oil to supply the cities of Wuxi and Suzhou, respectively. Merchants from Northern Jiangsu have also continuously transported cotton, salt, and other goods for sale. Some private factories here are eagerly taking yarn and cloth to Northern Jiangsu in exchange for raw cotton. Encouraged by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Xin Yi and Tong Tai yarn factories plan to go to cotton-producing areas in Northern Jiangsu to purchase raw cotton and coal. In addition, Yong Sheng Grain Store also plans to go to Bengbu and a certain grain-producing area in Northern Jiangsu to purchase grain. The Coal Industry Association is preparing to organize a joint purchasing office to purchase coal from coal-producing areas such as Huainan and Xuzhou.

　　无锡与苏北工农业品交流
    【新华社无锡十七日电】无锡市工业品已与苏北农业品开始交流。苏北公营两淮贸易公司和苏北贸易管理处已先后运来豆油、豆饼、棉子、白油等项货物，分别供应无锡、苏州两市。苏北商人也陆续运来棉花、食盐等物出售。此间一部分私营工厂则纷纷携带纱布往苏北换取原棉。在工商局鼓励下，新毅、同泰两纱厂拟赴苏北产棉区采购原棉和燃煤，另有永升粮行亦拟赴蚌埠及苏北某地产粮区采购粮食。煤业公会则正筹组联合采购处，准备到淮南、徐州等产煤区采购。
