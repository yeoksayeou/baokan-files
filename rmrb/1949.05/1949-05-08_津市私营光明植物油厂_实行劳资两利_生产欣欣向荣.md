Tianjin, 7th – The private Guangming Vegetable Oil Factory in Tianjin's Fourth District had been shut down for three years before liberation due to the Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes and lack of raw materials. After liberation, with the strong support of the People's Government, which supplied raw materials (900,000 catties of cottonseed per month), it officially resumed operations on the 7th of last month. At the same time, due to the fact that both labor and management were able to earnestly implement the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, the labor-management relationship was harmonious and the output was increasing day by day. Under the education of the People's Government, the factory's employees worked hard to assist the factory in restoring production before the resumption of work; after the resumption of work, they also took into account the factory's current weak economic capacity and made more concessions to the factory in terms of wages and benefits, so that the factory could make a profit. At the same time, the factory also implemented some reasonable democratic measures, such as announcing the factory's accounts at the end of the month; workers holding weekly meetings to discuss production, welfare and other matters, and discussing solutions to problems with the factory at any time; and timely commending workers' achievements. The factory's technicians also often take care of the safety of the workers in their work. Therefore, the employees are united and have a high enthusiasm for production, and the output has increased greatly. In the cottonseed crushing section, at the beginning of the resumption of work on the 7th of last month, only 17,900 catties of cottonseed were crushed in one day and night; on the 25th, it reached more than 35,000 catties in one day and night, an increase of 20 percent compared with the period of Japanese and puppet rule. The average daily output of the oil pressing room during the period of Japanese and puppet rule was 2,750 catties, now it is 4,140 catties. In addition, workers are also very careful in protecting the machines and try their best to save materials. In order to further reward workers' active production, the factory stipulated that workers would be given bonuses in four grades according to their production performance in April: 8,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 4,000 yuan per person. In order to take care of expanding production and reducing expenses, the workers voluntarily reduced the grades to 5,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan, 2,500 yuan, and 200 yuan. At present, the factory is preparing to add employees and expand production. In addition to producing cottonseed oil and oil cake, it has also begun to use oil sludge to manufacture soap, and has ordered machines for manufacturing glycerin, preparing to use soap sludge to manufacture glycerin.

    津市私营光明植物油厂  实行劳资两利  生产欣欣向荣
    【天津七日电】津市四区私营光明植物油厂，解放前因不堪国民党的横征暴敛及原料缺乏，停工已达三年。解放后，经人民政府大力扶助，供给原料（月供棉籽九十万斤），得于上月七日正式复工。同时由于劳资双方均能切实执行发展生产、劳资两利的方针，劳资关系融洽，产量日益提高。在人民政府教育下，该厂职工在复工前，便努力协助厂方恢复生产；复工后，又照顾厂方目前经济能力薄弱，在工资待遇上向厂方多作让步，使厂方有利润可图。同时厂方也进行了一些合理的民主措施，例如月终公布工厂帐目；工人每周集会一次，讨论生产、福利等事项，随时与厂方商讨解决问题；及时表扬工人成绩等。该厂技师也经常照顾工人在工作中之安全。因此职工团结一致，生产情绪极高，产量大增。克棉籽部分上月七日复工之初，一昼夜内仅克棉籽一万七千九百斤；而二十五日一昼夜即达三万五千余斤，较日伪统治时期则提高百分之二十。榨油房在日伪统治时期平均日产量二千七百五十斤，现在为四千一百四十斤。此外工人对于机器也极为爱护，对于材料也尽力节省。厂方为进一步奖励工人积极生产，曾规定按工四月份生产成绩分别以八人千元、五千元、四千元三级普遍发给工人奖金。工人为照顾扩大生产，减少开支，自动核减为五千元、三千元、二千五百元、二百元四级。目前厂方准备增添职工，扩大生产，除生产棉籽油，油饼外，并开始利用油泥制造肥皂，并已定购制造甘油的机器，准备利用肥皂泥制造甘油。
