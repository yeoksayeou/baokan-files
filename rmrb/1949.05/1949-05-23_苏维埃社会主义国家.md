　　Soviet Socialist State
    By Kalbinski

    The Power of the Laboring People—the Soviets
    The political foundation of Soviet socialist society is the Soviet of Workers' Representatives. The word "Soviet" is a transliteration of the Russian word, and its meaning is "Council of Representatives." The so-called Soviet of Workers' Representatives means the Council of Workers' Representatives. The Soviets initially emerged during the 1905 Revolution as organs of workers' uprising and as embryonic forms of the new revolutionary power. After the February Revolution in 1917, the Soviets spread throughout the country. After the working class seized power in October of the same year, the Soviets grew and consolidated to become the decisive force of the entire country—the state power.

    The Soviet is the most mass-based state organization, uniting all laborers, both men and women, regardless of nationality, race, occupation, party affiliation, education level, religion, etc. Within the Soviet, Russians and Azerbaijanis stand side by side, Ukrainians and Khakas, Belarusians and Uzbeks, Estonians and Kyrgyz, veteran Bolsheviks and non-Party collective farm women, world-renowned scholars and workers with elementary education, metalworkers and herders, railway workers and pilots, and so on. The representatives of the Soviet are elected by the entire people. Therefore, the Soviet is a kind, most accessible power to the people.

    Every village, city, district, state, province, and border region in the Soviet Union has its own Soviet. These Soviets are the local organs of state power of the Soviet Union.

    The local Soviets of the Soviet Union are fundamentally different from the so-called local self-governing organs in the past Tsarist Russia era and in present-day bourgeois countries. There, these organs have never enjoyed, nor do they now enjoy, any rights of state administration. There, the state power at the local level is realized by officials appointed by the government.

    The local Soviets of the Soviet Union lead the economic, cultural, and political construction work within their districts, prepare their own budgets, maintain state order within their districts, abide by laws and protect the rights of citizens, and assist in strengthening national defense. They elect their own executive committees, whose entire activities are accountable to the Soviet. They establish offices or departments to manage various aspects of state administration, such as the Department of National Education, the Department of Health, the Department of Local Industry, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Social Insurance, etc.

    To effectively assist their work, the Soviets elect various standing specialized committees. These committees connect the Soviets with the residents and electors, drawing the broad masses of laborers into participating in state management.

    The Soviet is the power of the laboring people. The Soviet Constitution clearly states: "All power in the USSR belongs to the urban and rural working people as represented by the Soviets of Working People's Deputies."

    This means that the Soviets elected by the urban and rural working people realize all state power of the Soviet Union and all state power of each Union Republic. Therefore, every citizen of the Soviet Union can rightfully and proudly say about their country: "Our country is ourselves!"

    The fundamental difference between the Soviet state and all bourgeois states lies in the fact that the mass organizations of the two classes, workers and peasants, are its political foundation. Workers and peasants are oppressed and exploited in bourgeois countries, while in the Soviet Union, they are free and manage their own country themselves. In capitalist countries, state power is in the hands of the bourgeoisie, while in the Soviet Union, state power is in the hands of the laboring people.

    The Worker-Peasant Alliance Led by the Working Class
    The alliance of workers and peasants is realized in the Soviets, in the common state work of the representatives of these two classes of Soviet society. Since its establishment, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has struggled to unite workers and peasants into a close alliance. Only by establishing and consolidating the alliance of workers and peasants can the laborers of the Soviet Union achieve their victory.

    Workers need this alliance because without the support of the peasant masses, they cannot defeat the capitalists and build a socialist society. Peasants also need this alliance because without the leadership of the workers, they cannot defeat the landlords and rich peasants and fundamentally improve their lives through collective farms.

    Workers and peasants need a close alliance to jointly advance the socialist system, continuously improve their lives, and defend their Soviet motherland against external enemies.

    The working class is the leading force in the worker-peasant alliance. Why?

    Workers are concentrated in large numbers in cities and industrial centers. In large enterprises, thousands or even tens of thousands of workers work together. This has long promoted workers' unity and organization to oppose the capitalists and their regime, to fight for the cause of the workers, and to fight for the liberation of the laboring people.

    Workers do not have private ownership of the means of production; they are directly concerned with the implementation of socialist ownership of the means of production.

    Thus, the conditions of life and work themselves promote workers to become the advanced class of society—the most revolutionary, most organized, most conscious, and most well-trained class in the struggle against all oppression and exploitation and for socialism.

    The situation of peasants in capitalist society is completely different. Peasants live scattered throughout the country. They engage in private operations. In the Soviet Union, in the first few years of the Soviet regime, the vast majority of peasants were still private owners. The conditions of labor and life themselves do not unite the peasants, but rather scatter them; they do not promote, but rather hinder, their organization to carry out a common struggle against their closest enemies—the landlords, not to mention opposing the Tsarist landlord regime and striving to transform the entire life with new socialist principles.

    Naturally, only socialism can fully satisfy the demands of the peasants as laborers. However, it is also necessary to explain to the peasants what socialism is, to prove to them that the socialist system is beneficial to the peasants, and to practically point out to them how to establish this system in the countryside. The workers of the Soviet Union are doing just that; they are helping the peasants to organize a collective socialist economy.

    This is why the Soviet working class has become the leader of the peasant masses in the struggle to overthrow the Tsarist landlord regime, oppose the landlords and capitalists, fight for Soviet power, oppose the rich peasants, eliminate rural exploitation, and strive to build a collective socialist economy.

    Now that a socialist society has been built in the Soviet Union, does this mean that leadership from the working class is no longer needed? No, we cannot say that.

    Now the Soviet Union must consolidate and further develop Soviet socialist society and build communism. It needs to quickly restore the economy destroyed in the areas once occupied by the German invaders, build thousands of new industrial and agricultural enterprises, and also needs to improve labor productivity, make people's lives better, and make itself stronger. It also needs to cultivate conscious members of socialist society and capable workers of the socialist economy. They must be cultivated not only in schools from young people, but also from adults. Socialist society was only recently built in the Soviet Union, and there are still many backward people among its people who have not yet abandoned old ideas, habits, and prejudices.

    To solve these difficult tasks, the leadership from the advanced working class is still needed.

    Now in the Soviet Union, although there are no more exploiters, the Soviet Union is still in a capitalist encirclement. We know that the Soviet Union has been subjected to aggression from capitalist powers more than once, and thus has been in very serious situations. The danger of this aggression will still exist in the future.

    Under these conditions, the Soviet Union also needs the leadership from the advanced class—the working class—in order to further consolidate its economic and military strength.

    Thus, we see how great the significance of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class has been and is for Soviet socialist society and for the Soviet socialist state. Therefore, Stalin said about this alliance: "This is the first and fundamental foundation of the Soviet Republic." (The above is an abridged translation)

　　苏维埃社会主义国家
    卡尔宾斯基  作
    劳动者底政权——苏维埃
    苏联社会主义社会的政治基础是劳动者代表苏维埃。“苏维埃”一语是俄语的译音，它的意义就是“代表会议”。所谓劳动者代表苏维埃，就是说劳动者代表会议。苏维埃最初是在一九○五年革命中作为工人起义的机关，作为新的革命政权之萌芽而发生的。一九一七年二月革命后，苏维埃普及及于全国。同年十月工人阶级取得政权后，苏维埃就长大和巩固而为全国的决定力量——国家政权了。
    苏维埃是一种最群众化的国家组织，它把两性的一切劳动者，不分民族、种族、职业、党派、教育程度、宗教等，统通联合起来。在苏维埃里，彼此并列的有俄罗斯人、亚才拜疆人，有乌克兰人和哈卡斯人，有白俄罗斯人和乌芷别克人，有爱沙尼亚人和吉尔基兹人，有老布尔什维克和非党的集体农妇，有世界著名的学者和受过初等教育的工人，有五金工人和牧人，有铁路工人和飞行员等等。苏维埃的代表是由全体人民选举的。所以，苏维埃是可亲的，最接近人民的政权。
    苏联的每个乡村、城市、区、州、省、边区都有苏维埃。这些苏维埃就是苏联国家政权的地方机关。
    苏联的地方苏维埃，是与过去帝俄时代及现在资产阶级国家里所有的所谓地方自治机关根本不同的。在那里，这些机关从未享有现在也没有享有国家行政的任何权利。在那里，地方上的国家政权是由政府所委任的官吏来实现的。
    苏联的地方苏维埃领导本区内经济的及文化政治的建设工作，编造自己的预算，维持本区内的国家秩序，遵守法律和保护公民的权利，协助国防力量的加强。它们选举自己的执行委员会，后者的全部活动向苏维埃负责。它们设立各所或科，掌理国家行政的各部门，比如国民教育所、保健所、地方工业所、商业所、社会保险所等。
    苏维埃为了实际上帮助自己的工作，选举各种常设的专门委员会。这种委员会把苏维埃和居民和选举人联系起来，把广大的劳动群众吸收来参加国家管理工作。
    苏维埃是劳动者的政权。苏联宪法关于这一点明确地说道：“苏联全部政权属于以劳动者代表苏维埃为代表的城市和乡村的劳动者”。
    这就是说，城市和乡村劳动者所选举的苏维埃，实现苏联的全部国家政权和每一个加盟苏维埃社会主义共和国的全部国家政权。故苏联的每个公民关于自己的国家都可以有充分权利地并骄傲地说：“我们的国家就是我们自己！”
    苏维埃国家与一切资产阶级国家的根本区别，就在于工人和农民两个阶级的群众组织是它的政治基础。工人和农民在资产阶级国家里是受压迫和被剥削的，而在苏联，是自由的，和自己管理自己的国家的。在资本主义国家里，国家政权是握在资产阶级的手中，而在苏联，国家政权是握在劳动者手中。
    工人阶级所领导的工农联盟
    工人和农民的联盟，是在苏维埃，是在属于苏联社会这两个阶级的代表之共同的国家工作中实现的。苏联共产党自其成立之日起，就是为了工人和农民联合起来成为亲密联盟而斗争的。只有成立和巩固了工人和农民的联盟，苏联的劳动者才能获得自己的胜利。
    工人是需要这种联盟的，因为没有农民群众的支持，他们就不能战胜资本家，建设社会主义社会。农民也是需要这种联盟的，因为没有工人的领导，他们就不能战胜地主和富农，经过集体农场达到自己生活的根本改善。
    工人和农民都需要亲密的联盟，为的共同向前发展社会主义制度，不停止地改善自己的生活，保卫自己的苏维埃祖国，以反对外部敌人。
    工人阶级是工农联盟中的领导力量。什么原因呢？
    工人是大量地集中在城市和工业中心。在大企业里，几千乃至上万的工人在一块儿工作。这老早就促进工人团结，组织起来，反对资本家及其政权，争取工人的事业、争取劳动者的解放。
    工人没有生产工具和生产资料的私人所有权，他们所直接关心的是实行生产资料的社会主义所有制。
    这样，生活和工作的条件本身就促进工人成为社会底先进阶级——在反对一切压迫、剥削、争取社会主义的斗争中最革命、最有组织、最觉悟、最有锻炼的阶级。
    农民在资本主义社会里的状况完全是另一种样子。农民是零散地住在全国。他们进行着私有的经营。在苏联，在苏维埃政权的最初数年，农民的最大多数也还是私有的业主。劳动和生活的条件本身，不是把农民联合起来，而是把他们分散开来，不是促进，而是阻碍他们组织起来去同他们的最近的敌人——地主进行共同的斗争，至于反对沙皇地主的政权，争取以新的社会主义的原则改造全部生活之事，更谈不到了。
    自然，社会主义，只有社会主义才能完全满足作为劳动者的农民的要求。然而，还应当向农民说明什么是社会主义，向他们证明社会主义制度是对农民有利的，在实际上向他们指明在乡村如何建立这种制度。苏联的工人就是这样作的，他们帮助农民组织了集体的社会主义经济。
    这就是以什么原因，苏联工人阶级曾成了农民群众在推翻沙皇地主政权，反对地主资本家，争取苏维埃政权，反对富农，消灭乡村剥削，争取建设集体社会主义经济等斗争中的领导者。
    现在苏联已建成了社会主义社会。这是不是说，工人阶级方面的领导再不需要了？不，不能这样说。
    现在苏联还要巩固和向前发展苏维埃社会主义社会，建设共产主义。它需要很快的恢复曾被德寇侵占区域里被破坏了的经济，建设几千新的工业和农业企业，还需要提高劳动生产性，使人民的生活更好些，使自己更强大些。它还需要培养社会主义社会的自觉的成员及社会主义经济的能干的工作人员。不仅要在学校里从青年中，而且要从成年人中培养他们。社会主义社会在苏联是不久以前才建成的，在它的人民中还有好多落后的人，他们还没有放弃旧的观点、习惯及偏见。
    要解决这些困难的任务，还需要先进的工人阶级方面的领导。
    现在在苏联，虽已没有任何剥削者了，但苏联还处在资本主义包围之中，我们知道，苏联不止一次遭受过资本主义强国方面的侵犯，因而曾处在很严重的境地。这种侵犯的危险，在将来还是存在的。
    在这种条件之下，苏联也还需要先进阶级——工人阶级方面的领导，以便更加巩固它的经济的和军事的力量。
    这样，我们看到，工人阶级所领导的工农联盟，对于苏维埃社会主义社会，对苏维埃社会主义国家曾经而且现在有着如何伟大的意义。所以斯大林关于这个联盟说道：“这是苏维埃共和国的头一个和根本的基础。”（中是节译）
