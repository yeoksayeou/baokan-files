    Mobilize Employees to Actively Assist
    Nanjing Rapidly Completes Takeover
    Real Estate Management Committee Established
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Nanjing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army, in taking over the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises of the Kuomintang, has been able to carry out the takeover work relatively quickly and smoothly due to mobilizing workers and staff to actively participate. After the military representatives sent to various enterprises entered the factories and enterprises, they held discussions or individual talks with the employees to explain the Communist Party's policies and attitudes towards employees, answer their questions, and dispel their concerns, thereby ensuring that the takeover work received the active assistance of the workers. More than two hundred employees of the Bank of China, after the manager fled, protected all archives dating back to the twelfth year of the Republic of China, as well as the bank's funds, furniture, tools, etc. During the takeover, under the leadership of the military representatives, the employees, based on their familiar business, divided into seven groups and actively participated in the handover work. When the work team took over the maintenance plant and repair plant affiliated to the former Capital Automobile Company, because they conducted prior investigation and research, solicited workers' opinions on the takeover work, and mobilized workers to elect representatives to participate in the takeover, the takeover was completed within two days. Workers of the China Agricultural Machinery Company also elected representatives to assist the factory in handling the handover. They also suggested that the number of materials listed in the handover list be published to the public so that all personnel in the factory could supplement and revise it, and then make a final list for inventory. After mobilizing workers to participate in the takeover, the workers' political awareness improved. After the completion of the takeover of many factories, the workers actively demanded to resume work and production. After the completion of the takeover of the Radio Equipment Manufacturing Factory, the work efficiency of the workers greatly improved. Before liberation, each person could only wind three packages of enameled wire per day, but now it has increased to five or six packages.

    发动职工积极协助
    南京迅速进行接管
    成立房地产管理委员会
    【新华社南京十三日电】人民解放军南京军管会在接管国民党官僚资本企业中，由于发动工人职员积极参加，使接管工作的进行比较迅速顺利。派赴各企业单位的军事代表进入各该工厂、企业后，即与职工们进行座谈或个别谈话，阐明共产党的各项政策及对售有员工的态度，解答员工们的疑问，消释其顾虑，从而使接管工作得到了工人们的积极协助。中国银行二百余员工在经理逃跑后，保护了从民国十二年至今的全部档案及行内资金、家具、工具等。在接管中，员工们在军事代表领导下，根据其所熟悉的业务，分成七个小组，积极参加交接工作。工作组接管原首都汽车公司所属保养厂、修理厂时，由于事先进行了调查研究、征求工人对接管工作的意见，并发动工人选举代表参加接管，因而两天内便接管完毕。中国农业机械公司工人亦选出代表协助厂方办理移交。并建议将移交清册中所列物资数目发榜公布，以便使全厂所有人员补充订正，然后作出最后清单进行点交。在发动工人参加接管后，工人的政治认识提高。不少工厂完成接管后，工人们即积极要求复工生产。无线电器材制造厂工人在接管完竣后工作效率大为提高，解放前缠漆包线每人每天只缠三包，现在已增至五、六包。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】南京十四日消息：南京市军管会和人民政府，为了使被接管的房地产不受破坏，已经成立了房地产管理委员会，由李达任主任委员，陈士渠为副主任委员，下设房地产管理处，直接办理上述房地产接管和分配工作，在南京的各部队机关和其他团体单位，如需用房屋，必须先向该处接洽，由该处统一分配。
