Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing maintains a hardworking and arduous style, learns humbly, and conscientiously performs its garrison duties. One unit, when guarding a warehouse, proposed that the task of guarding should be considered as important as combat. The unit's cadres took the lead in patrolling day and night. Although some soldiers were on guard duty for up to six hours at night, they took time during the day to inspect discipline, study policies, or repair the walls and fences around the warehouse to prevent bad elements from taking the opportunity to enter and steal. Many soldiers preferred to sleep on the cold ground to avoid occupying civilian houses or disturbing supplies. They encouraged each other, saying: "Coming to the city is not to enjoy ourselves, but to liberate the people and build the city. Life now is much more comfortable than it was in the trenches in the past and for comrades fighting on the front lines." All units humbly learned how to use various urban facilities such as electric lights, telephones, running water, and flush toilets, and did not move them arbitrarily. While guarding the warehouses, even though the warehouses were filled with things to eat and use, no one touched them. One comrade looked at an opened can, and another comrade shouted: "Hey! Keep your heart still, don't let your eyes wander, don't forget the original plan." Company Commander Zhang Weian found a package of cigarettes with a few missing in a pile of scattered cigarettes, so he took out his own cigarettes, filled it up, and sealed it. In order to realize the slogan of bringing exemplary policies and discipline to Nanjing, all units mutually supervised and encouraged each other after entering Nanjing. A newly liberated cook in the cooking squad picked up a cotton vest on the road. When the squad leader saw it, he immediately explained the reason why he couldn't take it and handed the cotton vest over to his superiors. The squad leader was afraid that the cook was cold, so he gave him his jacket. The cook was very moved. The second time he picked up a pen, he immediately handed it over. The soldiers in each unit have a kind attitude towards the people and carry out propaganda. After the residents near the garrison of one company were explained to by the company's propaganda, they automatically handed over three trucks of military supplies. A unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xiaguan helped an elementary school on Xing'an Road find the desks, chairs, and harmonium that had been looted by the bandit troops.

    南京我军保持艰苦作风  认真执行卫戍工作
    【新华社南京六日电】进驻南京的解放军保持了艰苦奋斗的作风，并虚心学习，认真执行卫戍工作。某部在看管仓库时，提出要把看管任务看做与作战一样重要。该部干部都带头昼夜巡逻。战士们虽然有些晚上站岗达六个钟头他们白天一有时间就实行检查纪律，学习政策，或则修理仓库周围的围墙与篱笆，以免坏分子乘隙进入偷窃。许多战士都宁愿挤在冰凉的地上睡，避免占用民房或搬乱物资。他们并互相激励着说：“进城来不是为了来享福的，而是来解放人民与建设城市的。现在的生活比过去在战壕里和现在前线打仗的同志已经舒服得多了。”各部对各种城市设备如电灯、电话、自来水、抽水马桶等的使用方法都虚心学习不随便乱动。在看守仓库中，尽管仓库里堆满了可吃可用的东西，但谁都没有去动他。有一个同志朝着打开了的罐头看了一看，另一个同志就喊着：“喂！心不动、眼不花、不要忘了原订的计划。”连长张维安在一堆零星的纸烟中发现有一包缺少了几支，他就掏出自己的香烟把它装满封好。某部为了实现把模范的政策纪律带到南京去的口号，进入南京后都互相督促勉励。炊事班的一个新被解放的炊事员，在路上拾了一件棉背心，班长见了马上向他说明不能拿的道理，并将棉背心交给了上级。班长又怕这个炊事员冷，把自己的夹袄给了他，这个炊事员非常感动，第二次他拾到一支钢笔，立即交了出来。各部战士们对老百姓态度和气，并进行宣传。某连驻地市民经该连宣传解释后，自动缴出三汽车军用物资。驻下关的解放军某部，帮助兴安路一所小学找回被匪军抢走的桌椅和风琴。
