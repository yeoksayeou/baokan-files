Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th. The North China People's Government has allocated 7,879,500 jin of millet as loans to help disaster victims in the suburbs of Tianjin repair their houses. The loans will be handled by the Cooperative Department of the People's Bank of China here, and the loan disbursement began on the 14th. The loan term is three years, half of the loan is in real terms, and half is repaid in cash, with one-third repaid each year without interest. In the war to liberate Tianjin, the Kuomintang bandit army burned and demolished more than 16,900 houses in the suburbs of Tianjin, affecting more than 6,480 households and more than 40,000 people. Because they were unable to repair their houses, most of the disaster victims were still living in shacks. Now that they have obtained this loan, they are starting to repair their houses.
