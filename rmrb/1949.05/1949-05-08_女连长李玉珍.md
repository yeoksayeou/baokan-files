　　"With Li Yuzhen in the unit, the wounded will never be abandoned." This was a popular saying in the Fifth Tiger Detachment (equivalent to a regiment) of the former Guangdong East River Column.

　　Comrade Li Yuzhen, since becoming a medic in 1941, has always closely followed the squads and platoons to the front line to rescue the wounded, acting as both a nurse and a doctor. She went to the mountains to collect herbal medicine to treat the wounded, and many wounded soldiers were saved by her. In every battle, under enemy encirclement and gunfire, she fearlessly rescued the wounded, buried the fallen comrades, carried their guns and documents, and then retreated. Once, during the Huangcun battle, our army was transferring positions in the dark, leaving only her, three wounded soldiers, and one fallen comrade in the position. She groped and found the unit and asked to send people to rescue them with her. Some comrades hesitated, and she said, "Can we leave our wounded comrades to the enemy?" The detachment's political instructor encouraged and supported her, assigning a squad of men for her to command. She took advantage of the darkness and, under constant enemy fire, found the wounded and finally carried the corpse, while the brothers carried the wounded, and they climbed out.

　　In 1943, during the Japanese "mopping-up" operation, Li Yuzhen was wounded in the leg during combat and could not transfer with the army. The superiors told her to stay behind to recuperate and assigned her to take care of two seriously wounded comrades. However, the enemy was advancing towards this area. In the darkness, she led them down the mountain, almost falling to their deaths. During the day, they hid in the big woods, avoiding enemy searches, comforting the two comrades, using mountain water to wash their wounds, and tearing her own shirt to wipe away the pus. They hid in the woods for five days, without food for four and a half days. Later, they finally found the unit.

　　During the famous ambush at Longjiang, Huiyang, the Chiang bandit army was defeated and fled across the Longjiang River, taking all the boats to the other side. Everyone chased to the south bank and was at a loss. She was the first to jump into the water, calling everyone to follow. The river became deeper and deeper, eventually submerging her shoulders and neck, but she held her rifle and medicine kit high and finally reached the other shore. She immediately opened fire on the enemy. Some comrades followed and crossed the river, bringing the boats to the south bank, allowing the main force to cross the river and pursue, achieving a great victory.

　　In January 1945, Li Yuzhen was promoted to company commander. The following year, she served as the captain of the armed work team, making frequent raids on the enemy, organizing militias to suppress traitors and counter-espionage, establishing local government and tax stations, which greatly solved the economic difficulties of the detachment.

　　After the Japanese surrender, the Chiang bandit army launched a large-scale offensive against the East River Column, repeatedly "mopping-up" three times, lasting more than two hundred days. During the "mopping-up", she accepted the Party's instructions and led the armed work team to hide in the Jiulian Mountains in northern Guangdong, which were eight or nine li high, to persist in the struggle. During the first "mopping-up", each person could still receive four pieces of sweet potato. When the bandit army came for the second time, she and a "little devil" climbed down the mountain to borrow some rice from the masses more than ten li away and transported it to the mountain, with each person receiving two liang of rice per day. But the amount of rice was too small, so they often gave their share of two liang to everyone else, only eating some wild vegetables and mushrooms they collected. The struggle continued! And they defeated the enemy's third "mopping-up".

　　Comrade Li Yuzhen is twenty-eight years old this year. She was sold as a child and wandered with a circus troupe as a performer. At the age of twelve, she was sold again to be a maid, and at sixteen, she became a female worker, enduring all the oppression of the old society. At seventeen, she joined the Huiyang Youth Association in Hong Kong, and in the same year, she joined the Communist Party of China. After the start of the War of Resistance, she returned to Guangdong to participate in guerrilla warfare. After eight or nine years of brutal armed struggle, under the cultivation of the Party, she was awarded the honorary titles of combat hero, model worker, and model Communist Party member many times.

    女连长李玉珍
    （全国青年代表大会代表介绍）
    “部队有李玉珍，伤员就丢不了。”这是前广东东江纵队五虎支队（相当于团）流行的话。
    李玉珍同志，从一九四一年担任卫生员以来，一直紧随班排到火线上抢救伤员，做看护又做医生。到山里采草药治疗伤员，很多伤员在她手上救活了。每次战斗中，在敌人包围射击下，她仍奋不顾身的抢救伤员，掩埋牺牲的同志，背上他们的枪支文件然后撤退。有一次黄村战役，黑夜里我军转移阵地，只余下她和三个伤员及一个牺牲的同志在阵地里。她摸索找到了部队，要求派人和她一道把他们抢救出来，有的同志表示犹豫，她说：“还能让我们的伤员同志留在敌人那里吗？”支队政治指导员鼓励并支持了她，拨了一班人给她指挥，她乘着黑夜，在敌人不断的枪击下，找到了伤员所在，终于她背了死尸，弟兄们抬了伤员爬了出来。
    一九四三年，日寇大扫荡，李玉珍在作战中腿上受了伤，不能随军转移，上级让她留下休养，还交两个重伤同志给她负责照顾，但敌人已向这地区推进了，黑夜里她带着他们从山上爬下来，差点跌死。白天躲在大树林里，躲避敌人的搜索，安慰那两位同志，用山水替他们洗涤伤口，撕了自己的衬衣为他们擦脓。在树林里躲了五天，有四天半没有东西吃，后来终于找到了部队。
    在有名的惠阳龙江伏击中，蒋匪军被打垮了，都逃过了龙江河，并且把船只都弄到了河对面，大家追到南岸急得没法，她首先跳下了水，招呼大家跟着去，河水愈来愈深，最后淹没了她的肩膀和脖子，但她把步枪和药箱高举起来，终于到达了对岸，马上就射击敌人，随着有的同志也跟着过了河把船撑到南岸来，大队人马才得渡河追击，获得了很大的胜利。
    一九四五年一月，李玉珍升任连长，第二年担任武工队长，来往奔袭敌人，组织民兵肃奸反特，建立地方政权和税站，解决了支队很大的经济困难。
    日本投降以后，蒋匪军对东江纵队发动大规模进攻，以五十个团兵力，反复扫荡三次，共历时二百多天。在扫荡中她接受了党的指示，带领武工队隐蔽在八九里高的粤北九莲山里坚持斗争。第一次扫荡时每人还能分到四片山芋。第二次匪军来了，她和一个“小鬼”爬到山下到十余里外，向群众借到点米运到山上来，每人每天分米二两，但米数太少，她们常常把自己应得的二两让给大家吃，自己只吃点采来的野菜和蘑菇，斗争还是坚持了下去！而且战胜了敌人的第三次扫荡。
    李玉珍同志今年二十八岁，自小被卖，跟着马戏班流浪演技，十二岁又被卖去当丫头，十六岁当女工，受尽了旧社会的压迫，十七岁在香港参加惠阳青年会，同年参加中国共产党，抗战开始回到广东参加游击战争。经过了八九年残酷的武装斗争。在党的培养下，她获得多次的战斗英雄、模范工作者和模范共产党员的光荣称号。
