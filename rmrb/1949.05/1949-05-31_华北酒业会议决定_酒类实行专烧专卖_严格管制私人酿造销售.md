　　North China Wine Industry Conference Decides
　　Implement Exclusive Production and Sales of Alcohol
　　Strict Control of Private Brewing and Sales
　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The first North China Wine Industry Management Conference opened on April 11th at the North China Tax Bureau in Beiping and lasted for fourteen days. Sixty-seven representatives from various administrative offices, provinces, and cities attended. The conference was presided over by the Director and Deputy Director of the North China Tax Bureau. The conference reviewed the past work on exclusive operations and focused on discussing future methods for the alcohol monopoly, organizational structure, and the control of private alcohol production, among other issues.
　　Attending representatives also believed that the alcohol monopoly is not only for fiscal revenue but also for reducing grain consumption and ensuring military and civilian food supplies, which is also an economic policy issue.
　　The conference decided to establish the North China Alcohol Monopoly Corporation. To facilitate leadership and centralize operations, it was decided that the alcohol business would adopt a policy that emphasizes both "unified management" and "decentralized administration." Unification would be implemented in terms of tasks, funds, organization, production and sales output, and cost accounting. Decentralization would be implemented in the supervision of policy implementation, the allocation of management personnel, education, and local coordination. Only in this way can the monopoly work be done well.
　　Specific decisions were also made regarding private alcohol, namely:
　　(1) It is strictly forbidden to privately brew white and yellow rice wine. All white wine will be state-operated. Each region can handle yellow rice wine according to its capabilities. In newly liberated areas, methods such as commissioned processing and supply of raw materials will be adopted to control private brewing. The market must be entirely controlled by the monopoly authorities.
　　To prevent the secret brewing of alcohol, strict control, registration, approval for manufacturing, buying, and selling will be implemented for the koji (fermentation starter) industry.
　　(2) To take care of the sideline production of the masses, in fruit tree production areas, private individuals will be allowed to brew fruit wine after autumn with approval, with a fixed quantity and on a regular basis. After the wine is made, it will be sold by the company's monopoly office, so that the masses can benefit. In areas with relatively high fruit production, the company can assist trade departments in absorbing and promoting fruit sales to solve the fruit production problem of the masses. Brewing is not allowed in non-fruit-producing areas.
　　(3) The management of medicinal liquor is to expand exclusive operations and increase production, while private brewing will be gradually transitioned.
　　(4) The production of alcohol, except for that self-produced and used by military industries, shall be taxed and then handed over to the company for exclusive sale, regardless of whether it is produced by public or private entities.
　　(5) The management and taxation of foreign wines and modified wines should be strengthened, and private operation and sales should be allowed.
　　(6) Beer will be produced by providing raw materials and entrusting commissioned production, with unified exclusive sales by the company.
　　Existing alcohol will be universally registered with the monopoly authorities for purchase at appropriate prices or supplemented tax clearance. Retail alcohol merchants must obtain a monopoly license. Selling alcohol without a license is not allowed. It was also decided that the promotion of alcohol in the future will implement a fixed sales area system.
　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Since its establishment in Beiping City earlier this month, the North China Alcohol Monopoly Corporation has successively established monopoly branch companies in major areas of North China to implement the policy of exclusive sales and control of private alcohol. So far, monopoly branch companies in Tianjin, Baoding, Zhangjiakou and other places have been established one after another. Branch companies in Chahar, eastern Hebei and other places will also be established. The company will also establish exclusive sales offices and retail stores in other counties and cities, or entrust county and district cooperatives to sell on its behalf, in order to vigorously expand the sales of monopoly alcohol.

### 华北酒业会议决定　酒类实行专烧专卖　严格管制私人酿造销售

　　华北酒业会议决定
  　酒类实行专烧专卖
  　严格管制私人酿造销售
    【本报讯】华北首届酒业经营管理会议于四月十一日在北平华北税务总局开幕，历时十四天结束。到会有各行署省市代表六十七人。会议由华北税务总局正副局长主持。会议对过去专营工作作了检查，着重讨论了今后酒专卖办法、组织机构及管制私酒等等问题。
    到会代表并认为酒专制专卖，不仅为了财政收入，而且在于减少粮食消耗，保证军需民食，也是经济政策问题。
    会议决定成立华北酒业专卖公司，并为便利领导及集中业务起见，决定在酒的经营方面，采“统一经营”与“分散管理”并重的方针，在任务、资金、机构、产销输出、成本计算等方面是统一的；在监督政策实施、管理事业人员配备、教育及地方配合上，则是分散的。只有如此才能作好专卖工作。
    对于私酒也作了具体决定，即：
    （一）严禁私烧白酒黄酒，白酒全部国营。黄酒各地区可根据力量办理，在新解放区，则采取委托加工、供给原料等办法，管制私酿，市场必须由专卖机关全部掌握。
    为防止偷烧酒，对制曲业采取严格管制登记批准制造买卖办法。
    （二）为照顾群众副业生产，在果木产区，允许私人在秋季后经批准定期定量的用果木酿烧，制成酒后，由公司专卖处销售，让群众有利，在果木产量比较多的地区，公司可协助贸易部门，吸收推销果木，解决群众果木生产。非果木产区则不准烧。
    （三）对露酒的管理是扩大专营，增加产量，私人烧制，采逐渐使其转业的精神。
    （四）酒精的产制，除军事工业自制自用者外，其余不论公私所制酒精，一律征税后交由公司专卖。
    （五）洋酒及改制酒应加强管理征税，允许私营私销。
    （六）啤酒采供给原料，委托代制办法，由公司统一专卖。
    现存酒类采取普遍向专卖机关登记，以适当价格收购或补税清理，零销酒商必须领取专卖执照，无执照不准卖酒，并决定今后酒的推销，实行确定销区制度。
    【本报讯】华北酒业专卖总公司自本月初在北平市成立以来，为贯彻专卖及管制私酒方针，已先后在华北各主要地区建立了专卖分公司。至目前为止，天津、保定、张家口等三处专卖分公司已先后建立，察哈尔、冀东等地分公司亦将建立，该公司并将在其他各县市建立专销处及零销店，或委托县区合作社代销，以便大力开展专卖酒的销路。
