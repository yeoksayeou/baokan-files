Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 8th: According to a Polish news agency report, European countries have various reactions to the Soviet, American, British, and French Four-Power Agreement. The successful conclusion of the Four-Power talks and the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference have aroused widespread satisfaction among the people in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany; however, it has caused a sense of confusion in the Western-occupied zones of Germany.

Paris newspapers published the Four-Power Communiqué in prominent positions. "Le Monde" stated that the Soviet policy towards Germany has been proven correct.

Rome newspapers all published editorials on the Four-Power understanding. "Unità" commented that May 4th was a day of victory for the Soviet Union's consistently pursued peace policy and a victory for the masses against the Western countries' strategic plans. However, the newspaper warned that it would be too early to think that the Berlin understanding would make the United States abandon its policy of dividing Germany. The US policy towards Germany is part of the North Atlantic Treaty, and it cannot solve the German problem. Some American policymakers do not hide their disappointment with the Four-Power understanding, which is a blow to the American policy towards Germany.

The upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference is the main topic of British newspapers. Editorials in various newspapers admit that the Soviet Union's proposal aimed at the unification of Germany will have a huge impact on German public opinion. The Times does not hide its anxiety that the success of the Four-Power Conference may delay the establishment of a West German state and weaken the North Atlantic Treaty.

The Four-Power Agreement produced a profound impression and received praise in Warsaw. All Polish daily newspapers published the Four-Power Communiqué on the front page. "Głos Ludu" pointed out that, except for a small group of warmongers, all ethnic groups welcome every step towards solid peace. The frustration of the warmongers' plans is a direct result of the Soviet peace policy. Among all the Allies, only the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the principles set down at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences. The newspaper also stated that opposition to the reconstruction of German militarism and support for the unification of Germany on a democratic basis are growing in Germany. The upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference coincides with the great strengthening of the worldwide peace movement—the success of the peace conferences in Wrocław, New York, Paris, and Prague. "Życie Warszawy" wrote that the establishment of the Four-Power Agreement is due to the following reasons: First, it is the Soviet Union's continuous and unwavering peace policy and its respect for its own signatures. Second, a necessary factor is the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has decisively changed the situation in favor of the peace camp. Finally, it is the great success of the worldwide peace movement—the success of the peace conferences in Wrocław, New York, Paris, and Prague.

    欧洲进步报纸赞扬四国协议
    象征苏联和平政策获胜
    中国人民解放战争胜利亦起了决定作用
    【新华社北平八日电】据波兰通讯社报道：欧洲各国对苏美英法四国协议的有着种种反应。四国谈判的胜利结束与即将召开外长会议一事，在德国苏占区人民中引起了普遍的满意；但是，在德国西占区中则引起了混乱的感觉。
    巴黎各报在显要的地位刊载四国公报。“世界报”称，苏联对德政策已被证明是正确的。
    罗马各报都刊载关于四国谅解的社论。“团结报”的评论称，五月四日是苏联坚持不渝地奉行的和平政策获得胜利的日子，是人民群众反对西方国家战略计划获得胜利的日子。但是，该报警告称，如果认为柏林谅解就会使美国放弃它分裂德国的政策，那就太早了。美国的对德国政策是北大西洋公约的一部分，它决不能解决德国问题。某些美国决策人士并不掩藏他们对四国谅解的失望，该谅解是对美国对德政策的一个打击。
    未来的四外长会议，是英国报纸的主要论题。各报在社论中承认，苏联的以德国统一为目的的建议，将对德国舆论发生巨大影响。泰晤士报并不隐藏它对四国会议的成功将可能延迟西德国家的成立并削弱北大西洋公约的焦虑。
    四国协议在华沙产生了一个深刻的印象并获得好评。波兰的一切日报都在首页刊载四国公报。人民言论报指出：除一小批战争贩子外，各族人民都欢迎每一个走向稳固和平的步骤。战争贩子的计划的遭受挫败，是苏联和平政策的直接结果。在一切盟国当中，只有苏联一直信守德黑兰、雅尔塔及波茨坦会议所订下的原则。该报又称：反对重建德国军国主义以及赞同德国在民主基础上统一的情绪正在德国增长中。行将举行的外长会议，恰与全世界和平浪潮的大大加强相合。“华沙报”写道：四国协议的成立，原因如下：第一，是苏联继续不断的与不屈不挠的和平政策及其尊重自己的签字。第二，有一个必要的因素，就是中国人民解放军的胜利，这一胜利业已决定地改变了形势，使之有利于和平阵营。最后，是世界范围的拥护和平运动的巨大成功——罗克劳、纽约、巴黎与布拉格拥护和平大会的成功。
