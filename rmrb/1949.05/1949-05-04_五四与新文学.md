    The May Fourth Movement had two important meanings: anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. It also had an incidental significance: its relationship with the New Literature. Fundamentally, both were liberation movements. In form, the May Fourth Movement was the liberation of thought expressed in action, while the New Literature Movement was the liberation of thought expressed in language. The New Literature Movement began in 1917, initially advocating vernacular poetry and prose. By 1919, it merged with the May Fourth Movement, and its content became truly rich, its strength grew vigorously because it gained the clear goals of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and the fresh forces of the nation's youth. Without the May Fourth Movement, the New Literature would not have developed so quickly, or even easily at all. Conversely, if the May Fourth Movement had not found its own language and still used classical Chinese as a tool, it would not have captured the nation's youth and the majority of the people. The merging of the two movements brought thought, action, and language together, completing their initial mission of liberation.
    The torrent of the times causes everything to evolve its life in metabolism. If the New Literature of the May Fourth era could not constantly absorb new life and reflect the new era, it would itself become old literature. This can be seen from three aspects: tools, content, and form.
    I. The main aspect of the New Literature Movement of the May Fourth era was the change of tools, that is, writing about modern life in modern language. In this way, it got rid of the pretentious and hypocritical posture and began to move towards the authenticity and vividness of literature. I say "began to move towards" because it had not yet achieved authenticity and vividness, and this is the problem of tools. At that time, the language used by most writers came partly from old novels, quotations, Peking opera dialogues, and terms from old literature, as well as some translated grammar; the greater part was everyone's patchwork of pidgin Mandarin. It was truly a nondescript, hybrid language. At that time, this patchwork-style language was barely adequate for conveying emotions; as a literary language, it was a bit dull. Because it did not grow out of the people, it lacked that fierce energy, those sentences that leap on the page.
    The Mass Language Movement of 1933-34 was in the right direction; due to the lack of practice by the majority of people, success could not be widespread. Recently, I have seen that literary works from the old liberated areas have made great achievements in this regard. This explains why those works can circulate among the people, and also points out the direction in which literary language should strive. Of course, thorough dialect often cannot be universally understood; but if good literary works bring these dialects to various places, wouldn't that also be common language? To make the literary language itself have life and power, it must be the application and growth of a certain dialect. And the richness of literary language must be the great achievement of the melting and confluence of these dialects.
    II. The content of the New Literature of the May Fourth era was undeniably aimed at the bourgeoisie and started from personal interests. Although there is no lack of beautiful material when targeting the bourgeoisie, the object is generally one of decline. This inevitably leads to literature leaning towards exposure and satire. Starting from personal interests and lacking extensive life experience, it tends to be sentimental, easily joyful and easily angry, as well as depicting trivial matters around oneself. Therefore, since the May Fourth Movement, literature in the past thirty years has shown its greatest strength and achievement in exposing imperialism and feudal society. In other words, it still belongs to the product of the era of destruction, not the product of the era of construction. The revolutionary literature since 1925-26, the later mass literature, and the slogans of "literature going to the countryside, literature joining the army" during the Anti-Japanese War were all proper in theory and direction; but practice could only be achieved in the later liberated areas. This also shows that only by tasting the sweetness and bitterness in real life can one reflect reality in literature. Not standing in a position of onlookers and with an attitude of pity, but abandoning the small self, finding the big self in the people, finding that the people's problems are one's own problems; finding that the people's aspirations are one's own aspirations. Only the technical skills of literature are one's own, just as the skills of carpenters and masons are one's own.
    III. As for the form of literature, in the early stage of the development of the New Literature of the May Fourth Movement, it tended to despise its own literary forms and adopt Western literary forms. The unfamiliarity of this form made it impossible for literature to be close to the general public. It was not until the Anti-Japanese War that the issue of national literary forms was raised. But the solution to this problem depends on examples. Recently, the Yangge dance from the folk, the dramas using folk songs, the novels with local flavor, the folk New Year pictures, and the folk dances are all appreciated by the general public because they are close to life. Literary history tells us that the Book of Songs, the Nine Songs, and the later novels and dramas all came from the folk. The literary forms brought from the folk with life and power often leave unlimited room for development. This also points out the future direction that literature needs to strive for.
    Therefore, if the tools of literature are the language of the people, the content is the life of the people, and the form is the national keynote, then it can more confidently and boldly absorb the essence of world literature; taking the essence and using it extensively to enrich and improve the flowers and fruits of one's own literature. These flowers and fruits are indeed one's own, because their roots are deeply rooted in the land of China.

    五四与新文学
    杨振声
    五四运动除了反帝反封建两层重要意义外，他还有一个附带的意义，那便是与新文学的关系。在根本上说，二者都是解放运动；在形式上说，五四运动是思想表现于行动的解放形式；新文学运动是思想表现于语言的解放形式。新文学运动起于民六，起初还是白话诗与白话文的提倡，到了民八与五四运动合流，他的内容才切实丰富起来，他的力量才茁壮滋长起来，因为他得到了反帝反封建的明确目标与全国青年这支生力军。假使没有五四运动，新文学不会发展得那样快，甚至不容易发展。反过来说，假使五四运动不得到自己的语言，而还用古文作工具，这运动便抓不住全国的青年与多数的人民。两个运动的合流，才把思想、行动、语言都打成一片了，才能完成他们解放运动初步的使命。
    时代的奔流，使一切都在新陈代谢中演化其生命。五四时代的新文学，若不能随时吸取新生命并反映新时代，他本身就会变成旧文学。这可分为工具、内容与形式三方面来看。
    一、五四时代的新文学运动，主要的是工具的改变。就是以现代的语言来写现代的生活。这样他才去掉了装腔作势，假惺惺的姿态，开始走向文学的真实与生动。说他“开始走向”，因为他并未能作到真实与生动，这便是工具问题了。那时一般作家所用的语言，部分的来自旧小说、语录、皮簧戏的对话、旧文学中的名词，还有一些翻译的语法；更大部分的是每个人东拼西凑的蓝青官话。真是所谓不文不白，南腔北调的家伙。当时这种百衲本式的语言，捉来传情达意，还勉强彀用；用作文学的语言，可就有点乏味了。因为他不是从民间生长出来的，他缺乏那点虎生生的劲儿，那般在纸上跳跃的语句。
    民二十二三年间的大众语运动，方向是对了；为了缺少多数人的实践，成功就不能普遍。新近看到从老解放区来的文艺作品在这方面确有了很大的成就。这就说明了为什么那些作品能在民间流行，也更指明了文学语言所应努力的方向。当然，彻底的方言，常不能得到普遍的了解；但若经好的文学作品把这些方言带到各处去，不也就是普通语言了吗？要使文学的语言本身有生命，有力量，他必是某一种方言的应用与滋长。而文学语言的丰富，也就必是这些方言融铸会合的大成。
    二、五四时代新文学的内容，不容分说的是以资产阶级为对象，以个人的兴趣为出发点的。以资产阶级为对象，虽不缺乏优美的材料，但大体上这对象是沈沦的。这就不能不使文艺偏向于揭发与讽刺。以个人的兴趣为出发点，又没有广大的生活经验，就流于感伤性的易喜易怒，以及身边琐事的描绘。故自五四以来，三十年中的文学，在暴露帝国主义与封建社会方面最显出他的力量与成绩。换句话说，他还属于在破坏时代的产品，不是建设时代的产品。民十四五以来的革命文学，稍后的大众文艺，以及抗战时期的“文学下乡，文学入伍”的口号，在理论与方向上说，都是正当的；而实践却只能在以后的解放区中。这也说明了必在实际生活中尝过甘苦，才能在文学中反映实际。不是站在傍观的地位与悯人的态度上，而是放弃了小我，在人民中找到了大我，找到了人民的问题就是自己的问题；找到了人民的志愿就是自己的志愿。只有文艺上的技术才是自己的，也如木匠、泥水匠的技术是自己的一样。
    三、至于文艺的形式，在五四新文学的发展初期颇倾向于鄙弃自己的文艺形式而采取西方的文艺形式。这形式的生疏，就使文艺不能与一般人民接近。抗战时期才提取了民族文艺形式问题。但这问题的解决是有待于实例证明的。最近来自民间的秧歌，采用民间歌曲的戏剧，乡土气息的小说，民俗的年画，民风的蹈舞，都以贴近人生而为一般人民所欣赏。文学史告诉我们，诗经、九歌、以及后起的小说、戏剧等，都是来自民间的。自民间带来了生命与力量的文艺形式，常留有无穷发展的余地。这里也正指出文艺需要努力的前途。
    于是，文艺的工具是人民的语言，内容是人民的生活，形式是民族的基调，他才能更有凭借的更大胆的吸取世界文艺的英华；取精用宏的来丰富与提高自己的文艺的花果。这花果确是自己的，因为他的根子深深的生长在中国土地里。
