　　[Jizhong Telegram] Some cadres in the Ninth Special District of Jizhong have shown slackness and a commandist work style in drought resistance and planting. In areas where cotton planting has been completed or is about to be completed, some cadres believe: "The crash cotton planting has been completed, it's time to rest"; or "It's time to go home and take a look," so they are not focusing on crash planting peanuts and protecting seedlings. The commandist work style is mainly due to the eagerness to complete the cotton planting task and not proceeding from reality. In Qicun, Fifth District of Anguo, more than a dozen households who planted less cotton were called to the village office and forced to plant more. After acknowledging the numbers, they were made to leave fingerprints as a guarantee before being allowed to return. In Xizuoluo Village in the same county, two households reported that they planted sorghum instead of cotton, and were detained in the village office. They were released after providing a guarantee, and were also told to destroy the sorghum seedlings and replant cotton. In most villages in the First District of the county, sorghum and millet have already been planted, leaving no bare land. District cadres still forced cotton planting, and according to statistics from eleven villages, more than 570 mu of seedlings were destroyed in total. In Zhezhuang, First District of Anxin, the masses were forced to dig earth wells on a large scale, but the wells being dug were not necessarily useful, resulting in the digging of more than fifty wells, most of which collapsed. Cadres in Shangzhuang Village, Tenth District of the county, stipulated: "All livestock and waterwheels in the village will be used by cotton-planting households for five days." Based on the above situation, the Ninth Prefectural Committee has instructed party committees at all levels to pay attention to overcoming and preventing this.

　　安国安新种棉中
  　强迫命令急待纠正
    【冀中电】冀中九专区个别干部在抗旱播种中发生了松懈现象和强迫命令作风。在已经完成或即将完成种棉的地区，有的干部认为：“突击种棉已经完成，该歇歇了”；或者是“该回家看看了”，因而对突击种花生和保苗抓的就不紧。强迫命令作风主要由于急于完成种棉任务和不从实际出发所致。安国五区齐村，把种棉少的十几户叫到村公所，硬叫多种，承认数字后并叫打手印取保才让回去。该县西作落村有两户，报的棉花种上了高粱，就被扣在村公所，取保放出，还叫把高粱苗毁掉，改种棉花。该县一区大部村庄都已种上高粱、谷子，没了白地，区干部也硬叫种棉，结果据十一个村统计：共毁了小苗五百七十余亩。安新一区增庄，强迫群众大拨工挖土井，而挖井的不一定使得上，结果挖了五十来眼，大部塌毁了。该县十区尚庄村干部规定：“全村牲口、水车都归种棉户使用五天。”根据以上情况，九地委已指示各级党委注意克服与防止。
