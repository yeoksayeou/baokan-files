Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 7th. The broad masses of people in the East Zhejiang Liberated Area are elated and inspired by the successive victories of the People's Liberation Army's advance into southern China. On May 1st, the Administrative Office of the East Zhejiang Liberated Area convened a military-civilian rally in its location to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing and International Labor Day. More than ten thousand soldiers and civilians attended. This was an unprecedented grand gathering in East Zhejiang in the past three years. Peasants from forty or fifty miles away came, carrying their rifles and dragon flags, beating gongs and drums. Government offices and troops organized Yangko dance teams and propaganda teams for publicity. They distributed documents such as Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders and the Eight Points of Attention, which were printed by printing workers day and night, as well as news of victories after the army crossed the Yangtze River, to the broad masses of people. The conference adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. The telegram stated: The ten million people of East Zhejiang are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the liberating army and the liberation of the entire Zhejiang Province. The guerrilla forces who have persisted in fighting the enemy in East Zhejiang for the past three years are inspired by the imminent joining with the main force of the People's Liberation Army. The telegram stated: "We thank you for your wise leadership and the heroic fighting of all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. Without these, the liberation of East Zhejiang would not have been possible."
