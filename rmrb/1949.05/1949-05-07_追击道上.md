    On the Road of Pursuit
    Lǚ Liáng

    The victorious People's Liberation Army is advancing rapidly southward along the mountains and fields of Jiangnan. In the mountains and on the plains, the vast expanse is filled with columns hurrying forward: infantry, artillery, cavalry, signal corps, they are arranged in one to four columns marching abreast, running. The commanders and fighters of the second echelon of the Yangtze River crossing are running in the lead. The first thing they say when they catch up with acquaintances ahead is: "We didn't get credit for crossing the river, hurry up and chase, if you chase too slowly, you won't get credit." As they speak, they wave their hands and run forward again. Two large red flags are fluttering in the wind at the front of a certain assault regiment, one with the words "First Merit for Killing the Enemy While Crossing the River" and the other with "Breakthrough the Yangtze." The commanders and fighters, looking at the new award flag, sing loudly: "The red flag flutters with a 'whirr, whirr' sound, the People's Liberation Army is like a sea wave, thousands of troops and horses advance forward, to liberate the whole country." Encouraged by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance, the pursuing troops are advancing regardless of wind and rain. On the muddy mountain roads, the animals have difficulty moving. A certain regimental commander took the lead in carrying a box of shells on foot. Gunners and machine gunners also disassembled the heavy mortars and heavy machine guns and carried them forward. Although everyone is carrying about fifty pounds of weight, they still travel eighty li a day. A certain artillery unit that had just crossed the Yangtze River, without waiting for the animals carrying the artillery to cross, hoisted the mountain guns and began to pursue. The People's Liberation Army advanced so rapidly that a regiment of enemies that had just escaped to Liangtianbu in Dexian County for the night, were captured before they even got out of bed. Everywhere on the road of the People's Liberation Army's advance is a scene of pursuit and capture of prisoners. A certain battalion's administrative personnel, carrying carrying poles and kitchen knives, also rushed forward and captured ten enemies. The utterly defeated enemies abandoned their cars and fled for their lives. Along the way, cars were lined up one after another, and everywhere were the bandit soldiers' cotton quilts, military caps, shoes, bullet belts, and colorful women's clothing. News of victory kept coming from the vanguard troops, causing constant cheers in the ranks: "Hurry up and chase! Don't let the enemy escape!" The propaganda team used umbrellas to form a propaganda tent and sang a quick-rhyme to the troops: "The Chiang bandit army is fleeing fast, comrades, cheer up and chase! Hold down the enemy's head!" Cannon fire came from the other side of the mountain, and the soldiers' pace quickened even more. [Xinhua News Agency, Southern Anhui Front Dispatch]

    追击道上
    吕梁
    乘胜追击的解放军，沿着江南的山野向南疾进。在山间和平原上，漫山遍野是匆匆前进的行列：步兵、炮兵、骑兵、通讯兵，他们排成一路以至四路的行军纵队奔跑着。担任渡江二梯队的指战员们跑在最前面，他们追上前面的熟人第一句话就说：“渡江时没立上功，快追呀，追慢了，又立不上功了。”说着扬扬手又飞奔前去了。两面大红旗在某突击团的前列迎风招展，一面写着“渡江杀敌第一功”，另一方面写着“突破长江”，指战员们望着新的奖旗高唱：“风吹红旗哗啦啦响，解放大军象海浪，千军万马向前进，要把全国都解放。”被毛主席、朱总司令的进军命令鼓舞着的各追击部队，不顾风吹雨淋地前进着。泥泞的山路上牲口行动困难，某团长就首先扛起一箱炮弹步行。炮手和机枪手也都拆卸开笨重的迫击炮和重机枪扛着前进。每人虽然背着五十斤左右的重量，但照样日行八十里。刚刚渡过了长江的某部炮兵，不等驮炮的牲口渡过江来，扛上山炮就开始追击。解放军前进得如此迅速，刚刚逃到德县良田埠宿营的一个团的敌人，还未起床，便当了俘虏。解放军前进的道上到处是一片追击和捉俘虏声。某营的事务人员拿着扁担菜刀也赶上前去抓住了十个敌人。狼狈不堪的敌人都抛了汽车逃命，沿路一辆辆汽车衔接着，到处都是匪军们的棉被、军帽、鞋子、子弹带，和花花绿绿的女人衣服。胜利消息不断从先头部队传来，引起行列里不断的欢呼：“快追呀！不让敌人逃跑呀！”宣传队用雨伞组成鼓动棚，向队伍唱着快板：“蒋匪军，逃的快，同志们加油追呀，按住敌人的脑瓜盖！”山那边传过炮声来，战士们的脚步更加紧了。【新华社皖南前线电】
