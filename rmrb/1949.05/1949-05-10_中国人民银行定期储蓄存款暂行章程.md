Provisional Regulations of the People's Bank of China for Fixed-Term Savings Deposits
April 20, 1949

I. Purpose: To promote thrift and reward long-term savings by people from all walks of life, organizations, and groups, fixed-term savings deposits are hereby established.

II. Types: The following four types are temporarily offered: (1) Lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal. (2) Regular deposit and lump-sum withdrawal. (3) Lump-sum deposit and regular withdrawal. (4) Deposit principal with interest payments. Each type is divided into two categories: currency savings and inflation-adjusted savings, to be chosen by the depositor.

III. Calculation Standard: For currency savings, the principal deposit and withdrawal and interest are calculated in currency. For inflation-adjusted savings, currency is converted into physical goods for deposit, and upon maturity, the withdrawal is paid in currency converted from the physical goods. Physical goods are calculated in "standard physical units," with one standard physical unit including a fixed quantity of flour (1 *jin*), corn flour (or millet) (1 *jin*), and cloth (1 *chi*). The price is based on the price announced in the local newspaper. Deposits and withdrawals are calculated based on the average price of the preceding five days.

Note: (1) The brand of physical goods selected will be fixed. If the brand changes, disappears, or is no longer a universal standard, the Bank may re-select another brand of similar quality to replace it and will announce it.

(2) All weights and measures will use the *shi jin* and *shi chi*, and fixed conversion methods will be specified (e.g., one bag of flour is calculated as 44 *jin*, one bolt of cloth is calculated as 100 *chi*, etc.).

(3) Prices will be wholesale prices (or retail prices). If there are multiple prices in a day, the average will be calculated.

(4) A major local newspaper should be selected as the standard. In areas without newspapers, the price investigated by the local economic department will be used.

IV. Storage Methods:

A. Lump-sum Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal: (1) For this type of deposit, the term must be agreed upon in advance when depositing funds with the Bank. The Bank will issue a deposit certificate as proof, and the principal and interest will be withdrawn together upon maturity. The deposit amount should be at least five standard physical units or 500 yuan, with no upper limit. (2) Term: Divided into three types: three to five months, six to eight months, and nine months to one year. (3) Interest Rate: For currency deposits, the monthly interest rate is 10 to 12 per mille for three to five months, 14 to 16 per mille for six to eight months, and 18 to 20 per mille for nine months to one year. For inflation-adjusted deposits, the monthly interest rate is 3 to 4 per mille for three to five months, 5 to 6 per mille for six to eight months, and 7 to 8.5 per mille for nine months to one year. (4) Early Withdrawal: This type of deposit cannot be withdrawn before maturity. If there are special reasons recognized by the Bank, such as weddings, funerals, or illnesses, and upon presentation of supporting documents, an "Application for Early Withdrawal" must be completed and, upon approval, will be paid according to the following regulations: ① For deposits less than three months, inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid in the original deposit currency without interest. If the price of goods falls, the deposit will still be paid according to the inflation-adjusted amount without interest. Currency deposits will be calculated at the Bank's current deposit interest rate. ② For deposits of three months or more, inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid according to inflation-adjustment, and the interest will be reduced to 1.5 per mille. Currency deposits will be calculated at the Bank's fixed deposit interest rate. ③ For early withdrawals of deposits of six months or more, both the principal and interest of inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid according to inflation-adjustment, and the interest will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 3 per mille; for deposits of nine to eleven months or more, the interest will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 5 per mille; currency deposits will be calculated at the Bank's fixed deposit interest rate. (5) Overdue Withdrawal: For inflation-adjusted deposits, if the deposit is not withdrawn after the due date or no renewal is requested, the principal and interest will still be converted at the price on the original due date if withdrawn within ten days. No interest will be calculated for the period exceeding the due date. If the deposit is not withdrawn after ten days, the principal and interest will be transferred to a current deposit account and calculated at the Bank's current deposit interest rate. If the depositor wishes to renew the deposit, they should notify the Bank before the due date for processing. Applications for renewal after the due date will be calculated based on the current price on that day. If the application is made by mail, the date of receipt of the letter by the Bank shall prevail. For currency deposits, no interest will be calculated if withdrawn within ten days after the due date. After ten days, the deposit will be transferred to a current deposit account and calculated at the current deposit interest rate.

B. Regular Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal: I. This type of deposit is a fixed-term savings deposit where deposits are made in installments and withdrawn in one lump sum. The term is divided into two types: six to eight months and nine months to one year. The deposit frequency is divided into four types: once every half month, once every month, once every two months, and once every three months, to be chosen by the depositor. One month is calculated as 30 days, and half a month is calculated as 15 days. II. Amount: The deposit should be at least one standard physical unit or 100 yuan, with no upper limit. However, the deposit in the last month shall not exceed the average of the number of deposits already made. III. Interest Rate: For inflation-adjusted deposits, the monthly interest rate is 3 to 4 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 5 to 6 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. For currency deposits, the monthly interest rate is 10 to 12 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 14 to 17 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. IV. Interruption of Deposits: If deposits are interrupted during the term, the deposit should still be withdrawn upon maturity. For inflation-adjusted deposits, the interest rate will be reduced to 2.4 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 5 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. For currency deposits, the interest rate will be reduced to 8 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 12 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. V. Early Withdrawal: If early withdrawal is required, it shall be handled in accordance with Item IV of Section A (Lump-sum Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal). However, for inflation-adjusted deposits of three months or more, the interest will be reduced to 1 per mille; for deposits of six months or more, the interest will be reduced to 2.4 per mille; and for deposits of nine months or more, the interest will be reduced to 4.2 per mille. For currency deposits of less than three months, interest will be calculated at the current deposit interest rate; for deposits of three months or more, interest will be calculated at the Bank's fixed deposit interest rate. VI. Late Deposits: If inflation-adjusted deposits are made late, the price will be calculated according to the market price within five days. If the deposit is made more than five days late, it will be considered an interruption. If prices rise when making up the deposit, the price on the day of the make-up deposit will be used. If prices fall, the price on the original deposit date will be used. If more than one-third of the scheduled deposits have been missed, the interest rate will be reduced to 2.7 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 4 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. If more than one-third of the scheduled deposits have been missed for currency deposits, the interest rate will be reduced to 8 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 12 per mille for a term of nine months to one year.

C. Lump-sum Deposit and Regular Withdrawal: I. For this type of deposit, the depositor deposits the principal in one lump sum, and the Bank issues a passbook. Thereafter, the principal and interest are withdrawn according to the passbook. Interest is calculated at maturity. The deposit amount for inflation-adjusted savings should be at least 20 standard physical units. The deposit amount for currency savings should be at least 2,000 yuan, with no upper limit, but it should be easily divisible for regular withdrawal. II. Term: Divided into two types: six to eight months and nine months to one year. The withdrawal period is divided into three types: once a month, once every two months, and once every three months, to be chosen by the depositor. Once determined, it cannot be changed. No interest will be calculated for the period exceeding the due date if the deposit is not withdrawn upon maturity. III. Interest Rate: The same as the stipulations for regular deposit and lump-sum withdrawal for six months and one year. IV. Early Withdrawal: If early withdrawal is required, it shall be handled in accordance with Item IV of Section A (Lump-sum Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal). 1. For deposits of less than three months, inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid in the original deposit currency for the unwithdrawn portion. If prices fall, the deposit will still be paid according to inflation-adjustment without interest. Currency deposits will be calculated at the Bank's current deposit interest rate. 2. For deposits of three months or more, inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid according to inflation-adjustment for the unwithdrawn portion, and the interest will be calculated at 1.2 per mille; for deposits of six months or more, the interest will be calculated at 2.7 per mille; and for deposits of nine months or more, the interest will be calculated at 4.5 per mille. Currency deposits will be calculated at the Bank's fixed deposit interest rate.

D. Deposit Principal with Interest Payments: I. For this type of deposit, the deposit amount should be at least 20 standard physical units or 2,000 yuan. The term is agreed upon in advance, and the deposit is made in one lump sum. The Bank issues a passbook, and interest is paid monthly according to the passbook. Interest is not compounded. When withdrawing interest, the original market price from the maturity date is used. The principal is withdrawn upon maturity. II. Term: Divided into two types: six to eight months and nine months to one year. III. Interest Rate: For inflation-adjusted deposits, the monthly interest rate is 3 to 4 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 5 to 6 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. For currency deposits, the monthly interest rate is 7.5 to 9.5 per mille for a term of six to eight months, and 13 to 15 per mille for a term of nine months to one year. IV. Early Withdrawal: This type of deposit, if it meets the conditions listed in Item IV of Section A (Lump-sum Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal), may also be withdrawn early with permission. However, the interest already paid shall be deducted. The method is as follows: 1. For deposits of less than three months, inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid in the original deposit currency, and the interest will be deducted in the original deposit currency. If prices fall, the principal will still be paid according to inflation-adjustment, and the interest already paid will also be deducted according to inflation-adjustment. For currency deposits, the interest already paid will also be deducted. 2. For deposits of three months or more, inflation-adjusted deposits will be paid according to inflation-adjustment for the principal, and the interest already paid will also be calculated according to inflation-adjustment and deducted after deducting the interest that should be obtained according to Item IV of Section A (Lump-sum Deposit and Lump-sum Withdrawal). For currency deposits, the interest already paid will be deducted except for the interest that should be obtained. V. When opening an account for any type of deposit, the depositor must first fill out a "Savings Deposit Account Opening Application Form." Select the type of deposit, book title, account name, occupation, address, etc. If withdrawals require a signature or seal, a specimen signature or seal must be provided for verification. VI. Storage: When making a deposit, the passbook must be brought to the Bank for registration. The Bank's teller and responsible personnel will stamp the passbook to be valid. If there are errors in the record, please inform the Bank to investigate and correct them. Do not make corrections yourself. VII. Withdrawal: When withdrawing funds, the depositor must bring the passbook and seal, and issue a withdrawal slip. The Bank's staff will verify the information and pay the funds if there are no errors. If no seal has been left, payment will be made according to the passbook (certificate). VIII. Loss Reporting: If the depositor loses the passbook or seal, they must report the loss to the Bank. After half a month of reporting the loss, they must obtain a guarantee or proof from an organization and apply to the Bank for a replacement certificate. If the Bank deems it necessary, a lost notice must be published in the local newspaper for at least two days, and two copies of the newspaper (one copy per day) must be submitted for verification. The depositor is responsible if someone fraudulently claims the funds before the loss is reported. IX. The interest rate regulations in these regulations may be changed and announced at any time if necessary. However, deposits made before the change will still be calculated according to the original interest rate. X. If the deposit and withdrawal dates of the various deposits specified in these regulations fall on Sundays or holidays, they shall be postponed. XI. These regulations may be formulated by the local branch savings departments in accordance with the principles to suit local use. XII. If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, the local banks and savings departments may submit their opinions, and the head office will revise them.
