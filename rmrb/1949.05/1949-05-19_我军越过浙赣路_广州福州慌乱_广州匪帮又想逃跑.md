Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: With the People's Liberation Army crossing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Guangzhou and Fuzhou areas, which the Kuomintang gang originally intended to rely on as their last-ditch bases, have also fallen into panic and chaos. The gang officials who had just fled from Nanjing to Guangzhou less than a month ago are now frantically preparing to flee Guangzhou again. The Guangzhou Garrison Command announced on the 15th that "Guangzhou is in a state of emergency," implementing emergency martial law and population entry inspections. Gang leaders He Yingqin, Zhu Tong, Yan Xishan, Zhang Fakui and others met on that day to discuss so-called Guangzhou "external war countermeasures." Li Zongren also issued an "emergency order," requiring the puppet chairmen of Fujian, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces to go to Guangzhou to discuss so-called "joint defense issues." A small group of puppet legislators in the puppet Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou declared a "resumption of meetings" on the 6th, and have now decided to adjourn the session early. Liu Jianqun, the deputy director of the puppet Legislative Yuan, asked the puppet legislators to leave Guangzhou as soon as possible. The gang government agencies have planned to flee to Taiwan, Chongqing and other places, and are drastically cutting staff. It is rumored that the Guangdong puppet provincial government is preparing to move to Hepu or Haikou, near Tokyo. The bandit garrison headquarters has ordered the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Statistics and Administration Bureau to quickly register all ships, large and small, coming to and from Guangzhou and within the Guangzhou urban area, in preparation for "military transport and emergency evacuation." The puppet government files and other valuables that were recently transported from Nanjing and Hankou to Guangzhou are now busy being shipped to Taiwan, Hong Kong and other places. The gangs continue to persecute the people, and the bandit garrison headquarters has ordered the general public to evacuate, forced major middle schools and universities to suspend classes and take holidays, and forcibly conscripted students from various cities, schools, and refugee students from various places who were lured to Guangzhou. According to reports, more than 800 students have been arrested and will be sent to Taiwan to the Bandit Army Headquarters Training Command for training. Prices in Fuzhou are soaring, and Kuomintang officials in the area are vying to escape by plane and ship. Ships heading to Fuzhou from Shanghai have been ordered to remain at the mouth of the Minjiang River and are not allowed to go to Fuzhou.

　　我军越过浙赣路
  　广州福州慌乱
  　广州匪帮又想逃跑
    【新华社北平十八日电】在人民解放军越过浙赣路线，国民党匪帮原来打算依恃为最后挣扎基地的广州、福州等地也已陷于惊慌混乱。刚从南京逃到广州不及一月的匪帮官员，现在又慌张地准备逃离广州。广州匪警备司令部已于十五日宣布“广州处于时状态”，实行紧急戒严法和人口入境检查。匪帮首领何应钦、祝同、阎锡山、张发奎等人达日会商所谓广州“外战争对策”。李宗仁并发出“紧急命令”，要福建、广西、广东、湖南、贵州、云南等省伪主席去广州商讨所谓“联防问题”。六日伪立法院有一小群伪立法委员在广州宣称“复会”，现已决定提前休会，伪立法院副院长刘建群要伪立委们尽速离开广州。匪帮政府机关已计划向台湾、重庆等地逃跑，并大肆裁员。广东伪省府传已准备迁往东京旁边的合浦或海口。匪警备司令部已命令市公用局、统政局迅速将来往广州和广州市区内的一切大小船只登记，以备“作军运及紧急输散之用”。不久前由南京、汉口运往广州的伪政府卷宗及其他贵重物品，现在又忙着用轮船运往台湾、香港等地。匪帮们继续残害人民，匪警备司令部已下令强迫一般市民撤退，强迫各大中学校停课放假，强抓各市各学校和被诱骗至广州的各地流亡学生当兵。据息：已有学生八百余人被抓，即将送往台湾交匪陆军总部训练司令部负责训练。福州物价飞涨，该地国民党要员争乘飞机和轮船逃亡，由上海开往福州的船，已被命令留在闽江江口，不准到福州去。
