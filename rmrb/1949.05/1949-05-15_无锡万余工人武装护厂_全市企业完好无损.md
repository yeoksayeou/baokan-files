    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 14th Dispatch: In Wuxi, over ten thousand industrial workers bravely protected the factories before the People's Liberation Army entered the city, ensuring that all public and private enterprises in the city remained intact. On April 23rd, when the bandit troops and government personnel in the city fled, the situation was extremely chaotic. The workers immediately proposed, "Don't let bandits and special agents destroy [things]; protecting factory equipment means protecting ourselves." They took out a machine gun, over forty long and short guns, and more than thirty hand grenades hidden in the private Lixin Yarn Factory, concentrated them in the industrial area, and carried out armed protection. At the same time, they universally organized factory protection committees or emergency response committees in various factories, uniting staff and workers to maintain order. Staff members of the National Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Agricultural Implement Experimental Manufacturing Plant moved into the plant with their families, determined to resist the bandits and special agents. The employees of various factories, with resolute actions, defeated multiple arson attempts by bandits and special agents. From the 22nd to the 25th, many workers stayed up day and night, guarding the factories. They finally coordinated with the People's Liberation Army to ensure that all public and private enterprises in the city remained intact, and they all resumed work successively on the second day after liberation.

    无锡万余工人武装护厂
    全市企业完好无损
    【北平新华广播电台广播】南京十四号消息：无锡一万多产业工人，在解放军进城以前，英勇的保护工厂，使全市所有的公私企业完好无损。四月二十三号，城内匪军政人员逃跑的时候，情况非常混乱，工人们当即提出“不让土匪特务破坏，保护工厂器材，就是保护我们自己”。他们把私营丽新纱厂所藏的一挺机枪，四十多支长短枪和三十多个手榴弹拿出来，集中在工业区一带，进行武装防护，同时在各工厂普遍组织了护厂委员会，或者应变委员会，团结职员维持秩序。国民党政府农林部农具实验制造厂职员，带着家属住进厂内，决心和土匪特务抗争。各厂职工以坚决的行动击败了土匪特务们多次的纵火破坏，从二十二号到二十五号几天中，许多工人日夜不睡，守护工厂，他们终于配合着人民解放军使全市所有公私企业完好无损，并且在解放后的第二天，便都陆续复工。
