　　Taking Another Step Forward
　　-- On Writing Poetry, Allegro, and Lyrics
　　Wang Yaping

　　The rapid development of the revolutionary situation, all newborn things, are constantly emerging and changing. This is truly an era worth singing about! Thus, among the submissions we receive daily, six or seven out of ten are allegros, poems, and songs. Most of the writers are workers, students, rural intellectuals, and urban literary workers. This should be a good phenomenon, because everyone, facing the light, victory, and fresh things, cannot help but be moved by emotion and express it in song. "All revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised" (Mao Zedong). Here, it shows the great joy of the majority of authors for the revolutionary victory and the encouragement of new things.

　　However, singing about the light and describing newborn things is more difficult than exposing darkness and describing old characters and old stories. The main reason for this is that our writers have too low a level of Marxist-Leninist theory and insufficient understanding of the development of the revolution and the inevitable victory. Once they pick up a pen, they feel confused and at a loss, and as a result, they can only produce some empty shouts and regurgitate political slogans.

　　Many allegros are still stuck in the same old tune of "Students, listen to me: National victory is in sight; Everyone works hard to study, it will be too late to regret if you don't make progress." I ask, what kind of impact can this have on readers! It does not show the specific circumstances of learning, what insights and feelings you have gained in your studies, and how you have improved yourself. Naturally, that "too late to regret" is powerless. Whether it's a small allegro or if you plan to write it vividly, with emotion, and with the power to move people, then you must specifically write about an event, describe a person, and the author must be very familiar with this event and this person. Before putting pen to paper, you must first be moved yourself, first recognize and integrate it through your own thoughts and emotions, and concentrate it into an image in your own mind; then, express it in appropriate language to achieve the desired effect.

　　Many lyrics and allegros make the same mistake. Just looking at the titles, they are all "Attack Jiangnan," "Millions of Troops Head South," "Attack Nanjing," "We Want Peace," and so on. The content of the lyrics is also nothing more than "Nanjing is liberated! Nanjing is liberated!" "Capture Li Zongren, capture the bad old Chiang." "We want peace, we want peace, strive for freedom and equality!" "Gleaming blades, loud bugles, millions of troops cross the Yangtze River." Because the authors do not understand the situation of millions of troops crossing the river, nor do they understand the specific situation of the liberation of Nanjing, they just sit in the house and write lyrics with a surge of enthusiasm, so it is difficult to write well. This is not to say that these subjects cannot be written, they can very well be written, but if you want to write them, you must first understand where the revolutionary victory and national liberation lie in the interests of the people of the whole country, and why the broad masses of the people are so jubilant? How did the author experience, recognize, and grasp their hopeful and enthusiastic joy? Are your own hopes and enthusiasm in harmony with the hopes and enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people? If you can thoroughly and deeply recognize these and feel these, the lyrics you write will have the power to move people and encourage emotions.

　　Many new poems, a small part of which are written well, such as "Song of the Cotton Mill Girl," "The Land is Divided at Home," and "Ping'an Gou is Peaceful," these poems all have the true feelings of workers and peasants, and are relatively complete in content and form, and thus can generate the moving power of poetry. The rest of the manuscripts are mostly empty regurgitations without thought, lacking emotion, or with disharmonious language. Take a look at the following example:

　　"Soldiers,
　　Advance bravely!
　　Plant the red flag in Taiwan and Guangzhou!
　　The reactionary regime,
　　Must be destroyed;
　　The remnants of feudalism,
　　Must be eliminated;
　　In order to jointly create and build a new motherland,
　　We are willing
　　To firmly support you,
　　Carry the revolution through to the end!"

　　What can such a poem explain? Which sentence can give people fresh and lively emotion? There is neither a realm of thought nor moving language, as if writing a few lines of a speech in separate lines is all there is to it. Although the author hopes to sing the praises of the People's Liberation Army crossing the river and supporting the army advancing south, it does not describe the image of crossing the river and advancing, nor does it provide a concrete image of the facts of support. There is no artistic processing at all, making it even more crude and inferior. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Artistic works that lack artistry, no matter how progressive they are politically, are powerless." What's more, written in this way, even judged from the perspective of political slogans alone, it is very unpolished!

　　In short, in the creation of poetry, allegro, and lyrics, we require authors to quickly and resolutely correct the existing shortcomings. Improve your own thinking and your understanding and keen sense of reality. Look more, analyze more, think more, process more artistically, approach the masses at any time and anywhere, go deep into reality, earnestly excavate vivid themes from the lives of the masses and reality, and take another step forward and improve on the existing foundation. Then, our poetry, allegro, and lyrics can move the masses and be sung by the broad masses!

### 再跨进一步——关于诗、快板、歌词的写作

　　再跨进一步
    ——关于诗、快板、歌词的写作
    王亚平
    革命形势迅速的发展，一切新生的事物，在不断地产生着、变化着，这真是一个值得歌唱的时代呵！于是，我们在来稿中，每天所收到的十分之六、七都是快板、诗、歌曲。写稿的多半是工人、学生、农村知识份子，和城市的文艺工作者。这应该是一个很好的现象，因为大家面对着光明、胜利、新鲜的事物，不由得触动感情，发为歌唱。“一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之”（毛泽东）。这里，正显示了广大作者对于革命胜利的狂悦，与对新事物的鼓舞。
    可是，歌颂光明、描写新生的事物，却比暴露黑暗、描写旧人物、旧故事还要困难。这主要的原因，是由于我们写作者，马列主义的理论水平太低，对于革命的发展以及必然到来的胜利认识的不足，一旦提起笔来，就感到荒乱不知所措，结果，只能作一些空洞的叫喊与政治口号的呕歌。
    许多快板还停留在“同学们，听我言：全国胜利在眼前；大家努力来学习，再不进步后悔晚。”的千篇一律的旧情调上。试问这样对读者能起啥影响哩！这里看不出学习的具体情况，究竟在学习中有啥心得、啥感触、如何提高了自己？自然，那个“后悔晚”也就没力量了。一首小快板也好，打算写得生动，有情感，有感动人的力量，那就必须具体地写一件事，描写一个人，而且作者对于这件事、这个人物还得很熟悉，在未下笔之前，自己先有了感动，先透过自己的思想、情感来认识它、融汇它，在自己思想里集中成一个形象；然后，再用恰当的语言表现出来，才能收到应有的效果。
    许多歌词和快板犯着同样的毛病，只从题目上来看，尽是“打到江南去”“百万大军下江南”“打到南京去”“我们要和平”等等。歌词的内容也不外“南京解放了！南京解放了！”“活捉李宗仁，捉住坏老蒋。”“要和平，要和平，争取自由平等！”“刀光闪闪，号声嘹亮，百万大军过长江”。因为，作者并不了解百万大军渡江的情形，不了解解放南京的具体情况，只凭着一腔热情坐在屋子里写歌词，那就难以写好。这并不是说，这些题材不能写，是很可以写的，但如果要写，首先自己得认识革命胜利、全国解放对全国人民的利益在那里，广大人民为什么这样欢欣鼓舞？他们欢欣鼓舞的希望、热情，作者怎样体验的，怎样认识的，怎样把握的？自己的希望、热情是否和广大人民的希望、热情融洽一致了？能透澈而深刻地认识了这些，感受了这些，你写出的歌词才能有感人的力量，鼓舞人的情感。
    许多新诗，有一小部分是写得不坏的，如“纱厂女工之歌”、“家里分了地”、“平安沟平安了”，这些诗都有工人、农民的真实情感，从内容到形式都比较完整，它也就能发生诗的感人力量。其余大部分诗稿都是没有思想、缺乏感情，或语言不调和的空洞呕歌。看下边的一个例子吧：
    “战士们，
    勇猛的前进吧！
    把红旗插到台湾和广州去！
    反动的政权，
    必须要摧毁；
    封建的余孽，
    一定要消灭；
    为了共同缔造和建设新的祖国，
    我们愿意
    坚决地支援你们，
    把革命进行到底！”
    这样的诗能说明什么呢？有那一句能给人以新鲜、活跳的感动呢？既没有一个思想境界，又没有感人的语言，仿佛把几句讲演词分行写写就是了。虽然作者希图歌颂解放军渡江，并支援南进的大军，但这里没有写出渡江进军的形象，没有具体支援的事实底形象，在艺术形式上丝毫没有加工，更显得粗劣不堪了。毛泽东同志告诉我们说：“缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。”何况这样写，即单从政治口号上来衡量，也是很不精警的！
    总之，在诗、快板、歌词的创作上，我们要求作者迅速而坚决地改正现存的一些缺点。提高自己的思想及对于现实事物的认识，与敏锐的感受力。多看看，多分析，多想想，多在艺术上加工，随时随地接近群众、深入现实、认真地从群众生活、现实中去发掘生动的题材，从现有基础上向前再跨进一步、提高一步。然后，我们的诗、快板、歌词才能感动群众，被广大的群众所歌唱！
