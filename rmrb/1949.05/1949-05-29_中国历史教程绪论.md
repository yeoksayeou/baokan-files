    II. Methods of Studying Chinese History (Continued from IV)
    Ⅴ. Dialectics believes:
    "Since the development process proceeds through the exposure of internal contradictions and the overcoming of these contradictions through the conflict of opposing forces based on these contradictions, then the class struggle of the proletariat is, of course, a completely natural and inevitable phenomenon." (Ibid., pp. 140-141)
    That is to say: we should not cover up the contradictions of class society, but should expose and reveal these contradictions; we should not obscure class struggle, but should carry it through to the end.
    In the experience and lessons of the Chinese revolution in the past fifty years, there are two examples of failure and one example of success, which can prove this truth.
    The first example of failure is that after the failure of the Reform Movement of 1898, the reformist Wuxu Reform, the revolutionary faction fought against the compromising faction of Kang Liang and the constitutional monarchists. In 1905, Sun Yat-sen united various revolutionary parties to form the Revolutionary Alliance, and put forward the three major programs of the revolution, namely, nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. Although it was an old-fashioned, general bourgeois democratic revolution, it was a mistake not to recognize that the imperialist powers were China's biggest enemies, but wanted to use them to help the Chinese revolution. However, it still united the broad revolutionary forces and carried out an irreconcilable struggle with the reformism and compromise faction. Therefore, it won the victory of the 1911 Revolution. It overthrew the Qing Dynasty and China's thousands of years of autocratic system, and established a democratic republic. Unfortunately, as soon as the revolutionary government in Nanjing was established, compromising factions such as Wang Jingwei strongly advocated peace talks between the North and the South. The revolutionary struggle was not carried through to the end. Although Sun Yat-sen did not agree with the compromise policy, he did not insist on it, but handed over the newly established revolutionary regime to the counter-revolutionary bureaucrats and the Northern Warlord Yuan Shikai, and recommended Yuan Shikai as president to the Senate. This lost the class position of the revolution, causing the revolution to fail and abort.
    The second example of failure is that in the era of the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the facts of the Chinese revolution had proved that the old-fashioned bourgeois democratic revolution was outdated and could not solve the revolutionary problems of China, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, while the new-style, special bourgeois democratic revolution was developing in China. This new democratic revolution was formed after the First Imperialist World War from 1914 to 1918 and the Russian October Revolution in 1917. Because a socialist country was established on one-sixth of the earth's land, this caused a major change in the entire world, changed the direction of the entire world history, and divided the era of the entire world history. During this period of World War I, China's capitalism developed rapidly because the European imperialists were caught in the vortex of war, and the pressure on China was reduced. After the failure of the Chinese revolution, the situation of warlord melee made people miserable, which made the emerging revolutionary class—the proletariat—had to look for a new way out. At this time, the victory of the October Revolution and the spread of Marxism to China came, and the new ideas of the new era came into being. The May Fourth New Culture Movement was not only a superficial literary revolution advocating vernacular writing and a ideological revolution to overthrow the Confucian shop, but also a reflection of new social thoughts, new political views, new revolutionary theories, and new political systems. It is a sign of the emergence of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. In 1921, the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat, the Communist Party of China, was established, and it raised the correct and clear revolutionary banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Only then did it recognize the object of the Chinese revolution clearly. Sun Yat-sen realized that the Communist Party of China was the new blood and vital force of the Chinese revolution, and was willing to cooperate with the Communist Party to reorganize the decadent Kuomintang, re-interpret his Three Principles of the People, and put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers to complete his revolutionary Three Principles of the People. After the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1924, the tide of the Chinese revolution surged forward, and carried out an irreconcilable struggle with the opposition and compromise factions, and won the victory of the Northern Expedition in 1926-27. Unfortunately, just when the revolution was about to win nationwide victory, the speculator Chiang Kai-shek, who had sneaked into the Kuomintang, betrayed the revolution and colluded with imperialism, massacred workers and communists in Shanghai, and established a counter-revolutionary government in the south. However, the Wuhan revolutionary government remained determined to fight and became the center of the revolution. The revolution went deeper into the countryside, and the land revolution developed vigorously. The compromising and opportunistic elements in the revolutionary camp, such as Wang Jingwei, panicked again and cried out that the peasant movement had gone too far. At that time, Chen Duxiu, the opportunist and capitulationist leader of the CPC Central Committee, also cried out that the peasant movement had gone too far. Not only did he not allow the revolutionary struggle to be carried through to the end, but he compromised with the counter-revolution, opposed the land revolution, and allowed the counter-revolution to suppress the worker-peasant movement. However, Chen Duxiu's capitulation and compromise policy of fearing that the bourgeoisie would leave the revolution could not stop Wang Jingwei from betraying the revolution and massacring workers, peasants, and communists after Chiang Kai-shek. The revolution was again defeated.
    The above are two examples of revolutionary failures. Now let’s talk about an example of revolutionary success.
    The successful example is that in 1931, Japanese imperialism created the "September 18th" Incident, and continued to occupy the northeastern provinces of China, and even Ping and Tianjin. The reactionary government of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek and others sat idly by the continuous loss of territory with a policy of non-resistance, and instead devoted themselves to the "suppression of the Communists" war and suppressed the national anti-Japanese patriotic movement. The Communist Party of China led the national revolutionary parties and the broad masses of the people to unite into an anti-Japanese national united front and waged a long-term and irreconcilable struggle with it, and finally forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept the request to stop the civil war and unite against foreign aggression. In 1937, the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War began. Although Chiang Kai-shek passively resisted Japan and actively opposed communism during the Anti-Japanese War, and conspired to compromise and surrender to the Japanese invaders, the Communist Party of China and its Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, and the patriotic people across the country, insisted on fighting the war to the end and opposed compromise and surrender, so that Chiang Kai-shek did not dare to surrender to Japan after Wang Jingwei, and finally won a complete victory in the Anti-Japanese War and forced the Japanese invaders to surrender. This is the first good example of carrying the struggle through to the end and achieving success.
    That is to say: to avoid making mistakes in politics, we must implement the revolutionary policy of the irreconcilable revolutionary class, and not implement the reformist policy of coordinating class interests, and not implement the compromise policy of capitalism "growing" into socialism. Even more, do not implement the suicidal policy of national subjugation and genocide of compromising with the enemy and seeking peace and temporary ease.
    This is the application of Marxist dialectics to social life and social history.
    As for the materialism of Marxist philosophy, it is fundamentally and directly opposed to philosophical idealism.
    "It goes without saying how great the significance of extending the principles of philosophical materialism to the study of social life and social history; how great the significance of applying these principles to social history and to the practical activities of the proletarian party." ("History of the CPSU," p. 145)
    Ⅰ. Materialism believes:
    "Since the interrelationship and mutual restriction of various phenomena in nature are the laws of the development of nature, then it should be concluded that the interrelationship and mutual restriction of various phenomena in social life are also not accidental, but the laws of social development.
    It can be seen from this that social life and social history are no longer a pile of "accidental phenomena," because social history has become the law-governed development of society, and the study of social history has become a science.
    It can be seen from this that the practical activities of the proletarian party should never be based on the good wishes of "outstanding figures," should never be based on the requirements of "reason," "universal morality," etc., but should be based on the laws of social development. It should be based on the study of these laws. (Ibid.)
    Some Chinese historians believe that history is created by heroes, the so-called "heroes create the situation." People who hold this kind of view often treat the people as slaves. Therefore, they cannot but tend to despise the power of the people, insult the people, and say that the people are generally ignorant people who have to wait for heroes to turn them into people. As the Book of Documents says: "The people change and live in harmony," Confucius said: "The people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to know." Some historians also say from an idealist point of view that psychology can create everything, and heroes can create the situation. As Liang Qichao said:
    "The biggest question at the beginning of the cause and effect in the historical world is: Do heroes create the situation? Or does the situation create heroes? In other words, is the saying that "history is the product of a few great figures" and "biographies of heroes are history" true or not? Rousseau said: "If ten or so people are removed from a world history, the situation may be completely changed." We cannot but admit that this theory does contain a part of the truth...I think that a major secret of history lies in how the personality of one person can be expanded into the commonality of an era or a group? And how can the commonality of an era or a group be manifested in the personality of one person? In other words: there are so-called national psychology and social psychology, which are actually expanded and combined products of individual psychology, and are manifested by individual actions...From the human psychology itself, there is a possibility of sudden changes. The change of psychology is extremely free and unpredictable. No matter how fixed a society is, it cannot predict or limit that someone or something will suddenly have a strange feeling; once this feeling erupts, it can spread to the entire society depending on the intensity of its mental strength." (Liang Qichao: "Methods of Chinese Historical Research," pp. 170-174)
    Marxists believe:
    "It is not heroes who create history, but history that creates heroes; that is to say, it is not heroes who create the people, but the people who create heroes and promote history. Heroes and outstanding figures can play a significant role in social life only when they can correctly understand the conditions of social development and understand how to improve these conditions. If heroes and outstanding figures cannot correctly understand the conditions of social development, but insist on acting recklessly regardless of the historical demands of society, and regard themselves as the "creators" of history, then they will become ridiculous, worthless, and unlucky figures." ("History of the CPSU," p. 27)
                                              (To be continued)

    中国历史教程绪论

    二、研究中国历史的方法（续四）
    Ⅴ  辩证法认为：
    “既然发展过程是经过内在矛盾底揭露，是经过基于这些矛盾的彼此对立势力冲突来克服这些矛盾而进行的，那末无产阶级底阶级斗争，当然也就是完全自然而必不可免的现象。”（同上，一四○到一四一页）
    这就是说：不应该掩饰阶级社会的矛盾，而应该揭发与暴露这些矛盾，不应该湮没阶级斗争，而应该把它贯彻到底。
    在中国近五十年革命的经验教训中，有两个失败的例子和一个成功的例子，可以证明这个真理。
    第一个失败的例子是，一八九八年改良主义的戊戌变法失败以后，革命派与康梁保皇立宪的妥协派进行斗争，一九○五年孙中山联合各革命党派组成革命同盟会，提出了革命的三大纲领，即民族主义、民权主义、民生主义，虽然它是旧式的，一般的资产阶级民主主义革命。没有认识到帝国主义列强是中国最大的敌人，反而想利用它来帮助中国革命，是很错误的。但还是团结了广大的革命力量，并与改良主义和妥协派作了不调和的斗争。因此获得了一九一一年辛亥革命的胜利。推翻了满清及中国数千年的专制制度，建立了民主共和国。不幸，革命的南京政府刚一成立，汪精卫等妥协派就力主南北议和。不把革命斗争贯彻到底，孙中山虽不赞成妥协政策，但没有坚持，反而把刚成立的革命政权交给反革命的官僚、北洋军阀袁世凯，并向参议院推荐袁世凯作总统，这就失掉了革命的阶级立场，使革命失败了、流产了。
    第二个失败的例子是，一九一九年“五四”运动时代，中国革命的事实已经证明，旧式的资产阶级民主主义革命已经过时了，不能解决中国这个半封建、半殖民地的革命问题，而新式的、特殊的资产阶级民主主义革命的潮流，则在中国发展起来。这个新民主主义革命是在一九一四年到一九一八年第一次帝国主义世界大战和一九一七年俄国十月革命之后才形成的。因为在地球六分之一的土地上，建立了社会主义的国家，这就使整个世界起了一个大变化。改变了整个世界历史的方向。划分了整个世界历史的时代。中国在这一次世界大战的时期，因为欧洲各帝国主义陷于战争漩涡，对于中国的压力减轻了，中国资本主义有了飞跃的发展，而中国革命失败后，军阀混战的局面，使得民不聊生，这就使新兴的革命阶级--无产阶级，不得不找寻新的出路，正在这个时候，十月革命的胜利和马克思主义传播到中国来了，新时代的新思潮就应时而生。“五四”新文化运动，不仅是表面的提倡白话文的文学革命、打倒孔家店的思想革命，而且是新的社会思想、新的政治观点、新的革命理论、新的政治制度的反映。乃是中国新民主主义革命运动产生的标志。一九二一年中国无产阶级的先锋队中国共产党成立，打出了正确的、鲜明的反帝反封建的革命旗帜，这才把中国革命的对象认清楚了。孙中山认识了中国共产党是中国革命的新血液，生力军，愿和共产党合作来改组陈腐的国民党，并重新解释他的三民主义，提出联俄联共扶助农工的三大政策来完成他的革命的三民主义。一九二四年国共合作以后，中国革命的潮流更向前高涨，并与反对派、妥协派作了不调和的斗争，获得了一九二六--二七年北伐战争的胜利。不幸，正当革命将在全国胜利的时候，钻进国民党的投机分子蒋介石背叛革命与帝国主义勾结，在上海残杀工人及共产党人，在南成立反革命的政府。但武汉革命政府仍坚决战斗，成了革命的中心，革命更深入农村，土地革命蓬勃发展起来，革命营垒中的妥协投机分子汪精卫等又惊慌了，大叫农民运动过火了。当时中共中央机会主义、投降主义的领导者陈独秀也跟着大叫农民运动过火了。不仅不让革命斗争贯彻到底，反而与反革命妥协，反对土地革命，让反革命去镇压工农运动。但陈独秀这种怕资产阶级离开革命的投降妥协政策，还是不能阻止汪精卫也随蒋介石之后背叛革命，大杀工农及共产党人，革命又遭到失败了。
    以上是两个革命失败的例子，下面再讲一个革命成功的例子。
    这一个成功的例子是，一九三一年日本帝国主义制造“九、一八”事变，继续占领中国东北各省以至于平、津。国民党蒋介石等反动政府，以不抵抗主义坐视国土的不断丧失，反而专事“剿共”战争，压迫全国的抗日爱国运动，中国共产党领导全国革命党派和广大人民团结成抗日民族统一战线，与之作了长期的、不调和的斗争，终于迫使蒋介石不能不接受停止内战、一致对外的要求。于一九三七年，开始了“七七”的抗日战争。虽然蒋介石在抗日战争中消极抗日、积极反共，阴谋同日寇妥协投降，由于中国共产党及其所领导的八路军、新四军，和全国爱国民众，坚持抗战到底，反对妥协投降，使蒋介石不敢继汪逆精卫之后投降日本，终于使抗日战争赢得了完全的胜利，使日寇投降。这是把斗争贯彻到底而获得成功的第一个好例子。
    这就是说：要在政治上不犯错误，那么，就要实行不调和的革命阶级的革命政策，而不要实行阶级利益协调的改良主义政策，而不要实行资本主义“成长”成为社会主义的妥协政策。更不要实行与敌国妥协求和，苟且偷安的自杀的亡国灭种政策。
    这就是应用马克思主义的辩证法到社会生活上、到社会历史上的情形。
    至于马克思主义的哲学的唯物论，那他根本地和哲学的唯心论是直接相反的。
    “不言而喻，把哲学唯物主义原理推广去研究社会生活和社会历史，该有如何巨大的意义；把这些原理应用到社会历史上去，应用到无产阶级党底实际活动上去，该有如何巨大的意义。”（“联共党史”，一四五页）
    Ⅰ  唯物论认为：
    “既然自然界中各现象底相互联系和相互制约是自然界发展底规律，那末由此就应得出结论：社会生活中各现象底相互联系和相互制约也同样不是偶然的事情，而是社会发展底规律。
    由此可见，社会生活，社会历史，已不复是一堆“偶然现象”，因为社会历史已成为社会底规律性的发展，而社会历史底研究已成为一种科学。
    由此可见，无产阶级党底实际活动决不应以“卓越人物”底善良愿望为基础，决不应以“理性”、“普遍道德”等等底要求为基础，而应以社会发展底规律为基础。应以研究这些规律为基础。（同上）
    中国有些历史家认为历史是英雄创造的，所谓“英雄造时势”。抱这样一类观点的人，往往把人民当奴隶去看待。因而他们不能不走向轻视人民的力量，侮辱人民，说人民是一般无知的群氓，要等待英雄去把他们变成人民。如尚书说：“黎民于变时雍，”孔子说：“民可使由之，不可使知之。”又有些历史家以唯心论的观点说，心理可以创造一切，英雄可以创造时势，如梁启超说：
    “史界因果之劈头一大问题，则英雄造时势耶？时势造英雄耶？换言之，则所谓“历史为少数伟大人物之产儿”“英雄传即历史”者，其说然耶否耶？罗索言：“一部世界史试将其中十余人抽去，恐局面或将全变。”此论吾侪不能不认为确含一部分真理，……吾以为历史之一大秘密，乃在一个人之个性，何以能扩充为一时代一集团之共性？与夫一时代一集团之共性何以能寄现于一个人之个性？申言之：则有所谓民族心理与社会心理者，其物实为个人心理之扩大化合品，而复寄个人之行动以为之表现。……由人类心理之本身，有突变之可能性。心理之变动，极自由不可方物。无论若何固定之社会殊不能预料或限制其中之任何事任何人忽然起一奇异之感想；此感想一度爆发，视其心力之强度如何，可以蔓延及于全社会。”（梁启超著：“中国历史研究法”，一七○--一七四页）
    马克思主义者则认为：
    “不是英雄创造历史，而是历史创造英雄，也就是说，不是英雄创造人民，而是人民创造英雄并推进历史。英雄，杰出人物，只有当他们能正确了解社会发展条件，了解应如何改进这些条件的时候，才能在社会生活中起重大的作用。英雄和杰出人物如果不能正确了解社会底发展条件，却竞不顾社会底历史要求而胡作乱为，俨然以历史底“创造者”自居，那他们就会变成滑稽可笑，一钱不值的倒霉人物。”（“联共党史”，二七页）
                                              （未完）
