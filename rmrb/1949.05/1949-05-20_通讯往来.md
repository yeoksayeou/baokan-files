To all correspondents in various regions:

　　Seizing the time for planting and sowing, completing the production plan, and sowing late autumn crops are the current urgent tasks in rural areas. We hope that everyone will focus on this task and organize the following reports:

　　(1) The situation of drought resistance, economization, and famine relief in various regions across the area; the degree of completion of the planting plan and the reasons for non-completion. Introduce typical examples, model deeds, and figures of economization and famine relief by organizations, cadres, and the masses at all levels.

　　(2) The specific process and typical experiences of cadres at all levels going deep into rural areas to improve production leadership.

　　(3) The specific situation of a typical district, village, or household becoming prosperous through production, and the specific methods for achieving increased production.

　　(4) The situation of rectifying militia organizations and strengthening public security work in various regions—the attitude of leaders at all levels towards this, the specific measures taken in various regions for public security work, the implementation situation, and the experience of mobilizing the masses to strengthen public security work, etc.
