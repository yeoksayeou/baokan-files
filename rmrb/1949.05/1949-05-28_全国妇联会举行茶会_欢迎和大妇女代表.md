　　The All-China Women's Federation Holds Tea Party
  　Welcomes Women Representatives to the World Peace Congress
    [This Newspaper's Report] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a tea party at the Beijing Hotel yesterday (27th) at 2:00 PM to receive Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Gong Pusheng, Qu Yuan, Dai Ailian, and other women representatives who recently returned to Beiping after attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, as well as democratic women who recently arrived in Beiping from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Over one hundred and twenty people attended, including Cai Chang and Deng Yingchao. Cao Mengjun, the Minister of the Kuomintang Area Work Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, presided over the meeting. After reporting the significance of the meeting, Comrade Deng Yingchao delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. She first extended a warm salute to the women representatives who returned from abroad and the sisters who arrived from the Kuomintang-controlled areas after enduring great hardships. She said: It is truly exhilarating that everyone is gathering in liberated Beiping at a time when news of the liberation of most of Shanghai has arrived. She said: The delegation brought the news of China's victory abroad, inspiring the people of all countries who support peace; now the representatives have brought back the task of supporting world peace, strengthening the responsibility of the Chinese people, and our women also have a share, and should gloriously undertake this task. Finally, she hoped that the sisters who have newly arrived from the Kuomintang-controlled areas will humbly study the policies and work hard to build the new people's city. Subsequently, the representatives spoke. Mr. Li Dequan said that the Peace Congress gave us great confidence, and we firmly believe that peace is guaranteed. Mr. Xu Guangping talked about how workers in the socialist Soviet Union and various New Democratic countries actively participate in production and construction, and how people's lives are rapidly improving. Ms. Gong Pusheng said: In the international conferences I have participated in in the past, the representatives of Kuomintang China always acted as the chorus of American imperialism, but this time, the Chinese representatives at the congress issued loud and just voices in the defense of world peace, the exposure of the American imperialist paper tiger, and the support of the revolutionary movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries. This is because we are supported by the people of all China. Dai Ailian and Qu Yuan both mentioned in their speeches that China's international status has been unprecedentedly enhanced with the victory of the people. Although the representatives of various countries speak different languages, Stalin and Mao Zedong have become leaders jointly admired by the people of the world. Then, democratic women from the Kuomintang-controlled areas @Yun He, Shi Ruzhang, Zheng Yihong, and others introduced their experiences in women's work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and unanimously expressed their willingness to work hard for the construction of a new democratic New China. Finally, Cao Mengjun delivered a speech: She first said that world peace is indivisible, and the Chinese people must expose the imperialist war conspiracy, consolidate our victory, and build a new democratic New China for their own liberation. She also expressed her condolences to the representatives who were still abroad and the representatives who remained in the Northeast. The meeting adjourned happily at six o'clock. (Qing)
