  　The Chinese People are Closely Watching
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st】 Qingdao News: U.S. imperialism is not only refusing to accept the demands of the Chinese people to withdraw American troops from China, but is also continuously sending more warships, aircraft, and Marines to Qingdao to carry out aggressive activities. On April 30th, several hundred U.S. Marines arrived in Qingdao by ship from Shanghai. On May 5th, another five U.S. warships and a contingent of Marines arrived in Qingdao from Japan. As of then, there were a total of one U.S. aircraft carrier, three cruisers, three destroyers, two minesweepers, three landing craft, and two transport ships berthed in the waters off Qingdao. On May 7th, four U.S. heavy bombers were transferred from Japan to Qingdao. On May 14th, 1,500 U.S. Marines arrived in Qingdao from the United States. According to a report from the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Guangzhou on May 16th, seven ships of various types belonging to the U.S. Pacific Fleet are also sailing to Qingdao. The Chinese people are seriously watching this aggressive behavior of the U.S. government, which infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and interferes in China's internal affairs.
