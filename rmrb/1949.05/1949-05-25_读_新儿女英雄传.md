　　Reading "New Children's Heroes"
    Xie Juezai

    When Comrades Kong Jue and Yuan Jing got married, they were writing the "Lan Hua Hua" (Orchid Flower) play. The congratulatory message I wrote to them was:
    Once sang of tree leaves, again composed "Lan Hua Hua";
    Next year a new record, creation plus a baby.
    When I got to Beiping, I saw them, the baby hadn't arrived yet, but a creation had—"New Children's Heroes."

    I read it, read it, reluctant to put it down, and quickly finished it. My ten-year-old daughter Dingding followed along reading, also seeming reluctant to put it down. I heard that Yuan Jing had read it to the old folks in Baiyangdian, and they all loved to listen. This is certainly not just because the language is simple, but because it says exactly what the old folks want to say in their hearts.

    The Chinese people, for the sake of liberating themselves—ten years of the Soviet war, eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, three years of the War of Liberation—there are really too many heroic deeds worthy of praise; there are really too many people's heroes who are born to die and are unyielding. And literary works that describe the heroic deeds of the people, like "New Children's Heroes," are still too few.

    Comrades Kong Jue and Yuan Jing stayed in central Hebei for two years to write this: they became familiar with the stories of the battles, understood the feelings of the people, and learned the language of the people. Their writing is serious and diligent, and therefore their work is successful.

　　读“新儿女英雄传”
    谢觉哉
    孔厥袁静两同志结婚时，正在写兰花花剧本，我写给他俩的贺词，是：
    曾歌树叶叶，又谱兰花花；
    明年新记录，创作加娃娃。
    到北平，看到他俩，娃娃尚未抱着，创作却有了——新儿女英雄传。
    我读着、读着，不肯释手，很快就读完了。我的十岁小女孩定定跟着读，象也有不肯释手的样子。听说：袁静曾对白洋淀的老乡们读过，都爱听。这当然不止是文字通俗，而是其中说的恰恰是老乡们心里所要说的东西。
    中国人民为着解放自己——十年苏维埃战争，八年抗日战争、三年解放战争、可歌可泣的英雄事迹，实在太多了；出生入死、百折不屈的人民英雄，实在太多了。而描写人民英雄的战斗史迹象新儿女英雄传一类的文艺作品，又实在还嫌太少。
    孔厥袁静两同志为写这，在冀中待了二年：熟悉了战斗的故事，了解了人民的情意，学会了人民的语言。他俩写作是严肃而努力的，因而他俩的作品，是成功的。
