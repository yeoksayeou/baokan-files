Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th—Under the support of the People's Government, most of the private metal smelting and machine manufacturing industries in Tianjin have resumed operations and have been developing. Currently, 48 smelting factories and 346 machine manufacturing factories are in operation, employing more than 3,800 workers. Before the liberation of Tianjin, due to the various forms of exploitation and extortion by the Kuomintang reactionary government, 70 percent of the iron factories were in a state of shutdown. After liberation, in addition to explaining to some factory owners who were taking a wait-and-see attitude to eliminate their concerns, the People's Government also provided concrete assistance in many ways. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce assisted various factories in purchasing some raw materials from the Northeast. The Bank of Communications established loan and order relationships with factories such as Yuan Ji and Guo Tianxiang. The Trust Company and Trading Company helped solve the sales problems of various factories through ordering. In order to encourage the manufacture of agricultural implements, the Taxation Bureau reduced the tax on cotton gins by half. At the same time, the wages of various factories have generally been appropriately adjusted and converted to calculation based on actual goods, so that the lives of workers have been guaranteed to a certain extent. As a result, the production enthusiasm of both factory owners and workers has been greatly improved. According to statistics: the output of the smelting industry in April totaled 635 tons, an increase of more than 46 tons compared with March. In March, the machine manufacturing industry manufactured a total of 688 units of cotton gins, flower gins, noodle cutters, waterwheels, and sock knitting machines. The output in April also increased. For example, Yuan Xiangtai increased the production of sock knitting machines alone from 9 to 12 units. Before liberation, Tianfeng Machinery Factory used more than 70 workers, working 11 and a half hours a day, to produce one flour milling machine per month; now it only uses more than 30 workers, working 9 and a half hours a day, to produce one flour milling machine. The sales of products from both industries have also become increasingly prosperous with the development of trade between urban and rural areas. The total sales of the smelting industry in April accounted for 92 percent of the total output. In March, the actual sales volume of cotton gins in the machine manufacturing industry accounted for 85 percent of the total production, and all sock knitting machines were sold out, with 149 units of inventory also sold. Many factories are now successively adding machines and increasing workers to expand production. For example, Chenglihe Factory has newly added four welding machines, and Tianfeng Machinery Factory has also added an electric grinder and started to increase night shifts. Various factories are also purchasing raw materials in large quantities from the Northeast and Shijiazhuang.

    津市冶金及机器制造业
    三百九十四家开工
    【新华社天津二十七日电】津市私营金属品冶制业和机器制造业，在人民政府扶植下，已大部复工，并得到了发展。现在开工的有冶制业工厂四十八家，机器制造业三四六家，共有工人三千八百余人工作。津市解放前，由于国民党反动政府的种种压榨勒索，百分之七十的铁工厂陷于停顿状态。解放后，人民政府除对一些抱观望态度的厂主进行解释，消除他们的顾虑外，并从多方面予以具体扶助。工商局曾协助各厂从东北购进原料一部，交通银行与元记、郭天祥等厂建立了贷款定货关系，信托公司和贸易公司以定货方式帮助解决各厂的销路问题。税务局为奖励制造农具，对生产的轧花机减半征税。同时，各厂工资一般地都经适当的调整，并改成依实物计算，使工人生活得到了一定的保障。因而厂主和工人的生产情绪都大大提高。据统计：冶制业四月份产量共六百三十五吨，较三月份增加四十六吨多。机器制造业三月份共制造弹棉机、轧花机、切面机、水车、织袜机等共六百八十八台。四月份的产量亦有增加。如元祥泰仅织袜机一项，即由九台增至十二台。天丰机器厂解放前用七十多名工人，每天工作十一小时半，月产面粉机一部；现在只用三十多个工人，每天工作九小时半，即制出一部面粉机。两业产品的销路亦已随城乡贸易的发展而日益畅旺。冶制业四月份销售总量占总产量的百分之九十二，机器制造业三月份轧花机实销量占生产总量百分之八十五，织袜机则除全部销出外，并售出存货一百四十九台。现在许多工厂都在陆续增开机器，增加工人，以扩大生产。如成立合厂已新添焊活机四部，天丰机器厂也增设电磨一部，并开始增加夜班。各厂并正向东北及石家庄等地大量采购原料中。
