(Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch) The state-owned Ren Guang Pharmaceutical Factory, under the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office Health Bureau, under the slogan of "Support the Liberation War, guarantee the supply of medicine, and vigorously promote the use of traditional Chinese medicine," has demonstrated great initiative and produced more than fifty kinds of medicines, including Neosalvarsan tablets (for dysentery), Sicnenine tablets (for cough suppression), malaria tablets, special anti-malaria pills, and Airtail pills, among others. These medicines have been tested by all parties and have proven to be very effective. Taking Neosalvarsan tablets as an example, the actual effect of treating dysentery is much greater than that of the American Huang Lingmai.
