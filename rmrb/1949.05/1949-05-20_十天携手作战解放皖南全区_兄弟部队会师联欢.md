　　Xinhua News Agency, Southern Anhui Front, 19th: Belated news: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army that crossed the Yangtze River from the west to advance south held a celebration in She County on the 5th of this month with more than 3,000 members of the Southern Anhui People's Guerrilla Force, who had persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, to celebrate the complete liberation of Southern Anhui and the victorious reunion of the two fraternal forces. As early as the second day of the army's crossing of the river, these two fraternal forces victoriously joined forces and, working together, completely liberated the vast area of Southern Anhui within ten days. At the meeting, representatives from both sides exchanged greetings and presented flags and flowers to each other. Amidst the majestic military music, slogans and cheers rose and fell, overflowing with the fraternal unity and friendship of the troops and the joy of victory. Commander Chen Xilian, on behalf of Commander Liu Bocheng, Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, and all the commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army, first extended cordial greetings to all comrades in the Southern Anhui troops, calling on the field army's commanders and fighters to learn from the Southern Anhui fraternal troops' spirit of close ties with the masses, heroic struggle, and tenacious persistence in fighting behind enemy lines. He also called on everyone to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders, learn from each other, and advance bravely to continue pursuing and annihilating the Kuomintang's remnant troops and liberating all of China. Commander Xiong Zhaoren and Political Commissar Hu Ming of the Southern Anhui troops spoke in succession, emphasizing that the persistence and growth of the Southern Anhui guerrilla war was the result of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Field Army's large-scale annihilation of the enemy's main forces north of the Yangtze River, the support of the people of Southern Anhui, and the united efforts of all comrades in the Southern Anhui troops. The Southern Anhui troops should earnestly study the Party's policies, learn from the Field Army's excellent fighting style and its example in implementing policies and discipline, strive to improve themselves, and move towards regularization to greet the great victory of the national liberation. At the celebratory evening party, the cultural troupes of the two fraternal forces performed wonderful programs such as "The Army and the People are One Family," "Victorious Reunion," and "Farming Dance."
