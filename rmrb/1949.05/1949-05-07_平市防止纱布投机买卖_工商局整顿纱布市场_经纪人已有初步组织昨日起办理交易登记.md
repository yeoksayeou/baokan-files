　　Beijing Prevents Speculation in Gauze
　　Industry and Commerce Bureau Rectifies Gauze Market
    Brokers Have Preliminary Organization, Transaction Registration Started Yesterday
    [This newspaper's dispatch] In order to prevent speculation in gauze, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau has initially rectified the gauze markets such as Bu Xiangzi. There have always been two centers for gauze transactions in the city, one in Bu Xiangzi outside Qianmen, and the other in the Daheng Inn in Cha Shi Hutong outside Chongwenmen. The former mainly deals in cloth, while the latter deals in both cloth and cotton yarn. A common feature of these two markets is that there are many brokers (commonly known as "matchmakers") active in them all day long. Following the rectification of the grain market, the Industry and Commerce Bureau began to rectify these two gauze markets in the middle of last month. The first step, registering and organizing brokers, has now been initially completed. From the 29th of last month to the evening of the 5th, 48 brokers have registered in Bu Xiangzi. Thirty-seven brokers have also registered at Daheng Inn. On the afternoon of the 5th, the brokers who had already registered in Bu Xiangzi held another discussion meeting at the street government and decided to provisionally organize the registered brokers into seven groups for preliminary management, and then formally organize them after the Industry and Commerce Bureau has completed its review. Since the brokers in Bu Xiangzi already have a preliminary organization, the Industry and Commerce Bureau began to handle daily transaction registration matters yesterday, the 6th. For every transaction, the names of the buyers and sellers, the transaction price, and the quantity must be registered to prevent activities by those who specialize in speculation in gauze. According to Li Zhendong, a representative of the brokers in Bu Xiangzi: After we have an organization, we will definitely follow the laws of the People's Government and introduce fair-priced and normal transactions, and we will never again fuel speculation. He also said: We hope that the People's Government will often call them to meetings and establish some necessary systems. Everyone should work together towards developing legitimate industry and commerce. (Yu)

　　平市防止纱布投机买卖
  　工商局整顿纱布市场
    经纪人已有初步组织昨日起办理交易登记
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府工商局为防止纱布投机买卖，已初步整顿了布巷子等纱布市场。本市的纱布交易一向有两个中心，一个在前门外布巷子，另一个在崇外茶食胡同，大恒客栈内。前者以布匹交易为主，后者布匹棉纱均有交易。在这两个市场上有一个共同点是：都有许多经纪人（俗称跑合的）整日活跃其间。工商局继整理粮食市场之后，于上月中旬开始整顿这两个纱布市场。第一步工作，登记及组织经纪人现已初步完成，自上月二十九日起至五日晚布巷子已有四十八个经纪人进行登记了。大恒栈也登记了三十七个经纪人。布巷子已经登记的经纪人五日下午又在街政府开了一次讨论会，决定把已登记的暂编成七个小组，以便先行管理，等工商局审查完了，再加以正式组织。工商局以布巷子的经纪人已有初步的组织，自昨六日起开始办理每日交易登记事宜，凡是一笔交易，都要把买卖双方字号或姓氏、成交价格、数量登记起来，以防止专做纱布投机买卖分子的活动。据布巷子经纪人代表李振东说：我们有了组织以后，一定遵循人民政府法令，介绍进行公平价格正常交易，绝不再助长投机倒把。他并且还表示：很希望人民政府时常召集他们开会和建立起一些必要的制度。大家一齐向发展正当工商业的路上走。（宇）
