Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th: Moscow dispatch: May 12th marks the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Lenin's brilliant work "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism." The People's Daily published an editorial entitled "Leninism is the Great Force for Transforming Everything," stating: Forty years ago, Lenin protected the Party's theoretical wealth from the encroachment of revisionists and traitors in his immortal work "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism." The ideas of dialectical materialism and historical materialism developed by Lenin in his works constitute the theoretical foundation of communism and the theoretical foundation of Marxist parties. The editorial strongly stated that the transformative power of Leninism, developed and brought into play by Comrade Stalin, has been proven by the entire course of historical development. The advanced theory of Marxism-Leninism has given the Bolshevik Party a powerful and invincible force. Armed with this theory, the Communist Party led the working class of the Soviet state to win the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution, which has world-historical significance, and in an unprecedentedly short historical period, transformed the Soviet Union from backwardness to progress, from an agricultural country to a powerful socialist country with industrialized and collectivized agricultural economy, and is now gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. The editorial stated: Lenin and Stalin pointed out to the people of all nations the correct path to liberate themselves from the shackles of capitalism and move towards happiness and progress. Now the forces of democracy and socialism throughout the world are growing stronger day by day. Our century is the century of the brilliant victory of Leninism and the Marxist-Leninist worldview.

    出版四十周年真理报发表社论
    【新华社北平十三日电】莫斯科讯：五月十二日是列宁的天才著作“唯物论与经验批判论”出版的四十周年纪念日。真理报以“列宁主义是改造一切的伟大力量”为题，发表社论内称：四十周年前，列宁在他的不朽名著“唯物论与经验批判论”中保护了党的理论财富，使之免受修正主义者与叛徒们的侵害。列宁在他的著作中所发展的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的思想，构成了共产主义的理论基础，马克思主义政党的理论基础。社论力称，由斯大林同志发展和发挥了的列宁主义的改造一切的力量，已经为历史发展的全部过程所证明了。马克思列宁主义的先进理论，使布尔塞维克党获得了强有力的不可征服的力量。为这种理论所武装了的共产党，领导苏维埃国家的工人阶级赢得了具有世界历史意义的十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，并在空前短暂的历史时期内，使苏联从落后飞跃到进步、从农业国变成强大的工业化与集体农业经济的社会主义国家，而现在正逐步地从社会主义过渡到共产主义。社论称：列宁与斯大林向世界各族人民指出了从资本主义桎梏下解放出来，并走向幸福与进步的正确道路。现在全世界民主与社会主义的力量正一天天扩大加强。我们的世纪正是列宁主义和马列主义世界观光辉胜利的世纪。
