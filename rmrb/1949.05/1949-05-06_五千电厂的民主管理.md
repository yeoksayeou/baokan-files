    Democratic Management at the 5,000 Kilowatt Power Plant
    By our reporter Su Youmin
    The 5,000 Kilowatt Power Plant is one of the largest power stations of the Fengfeng Coal Mine, with a total of 450 employees. Established last December, it has achieved great success in saving materials, improving technology, and increasing production during the Great Production Movement this year. In the summary of the three-month production competition since the beginning of spring, it was recognized by the employee representatives of all seven plants in the mine. This was achieved after correctly resolving the working relationship between the administration, the trade union, and the Party branch. However, they went through a tortuous road. As early as the restoration of the 200 Kilowatt Power Plant and the 320 Kilowatt Power Plant last year, there was a lack of experienced and technically skilled engineering personnel, coupled with inadequate planning and the existence of wage-labor views among some workers. As a result, the civil engineering that had been built had problems, the machines were installed but could not be used, materials were wasted, the power supply time was delayed, and there were many different opinions. This was mainly because they did not vigorously rely on the workers to develop and organize their initiative. Although the workers had already moved and hid machines during the war preparedness after the liberation of Fengfeng, and restored production under difficult conditions, and the workers had contributed equipment and tools, etc., which showed that the power, wisdom, and enthusiasm of the workers were relied upon to complete the tasks of each stage, they still could not clearly understand this point. Accepting past lessons, the leading cadres first clarified this, and the workers gradually raised their awareness. From the construction of the 5,000 Kilowatt plant in December last year until the recent completion of the restoration of the 500 Kilowatt plant, in the construction committee, for each partial project, there was a construction committee, a technical system, and a detailed rules research association; after the restoration, in deciding major issues, in addition to the factory management committee, there were also extensive mass representatives forming a success and failure inspection committee between departments. The organizational form was established with the different tasks of each period, because the leading ideology and the process of worker improvement also went through many setbacks, but finally they explored this only road in construction. First of all, for a work task, the leaders put forward a specific formulation for everyone to discuss. When the 5,000 Kilowatt power plant was being built, Engineer Chen initially estimated that it would take three to three and a half months to supply power based on the existing materials, machines, and manpower. If this were the case, it would greatly delay production, but after mobilizing the workers for discussion and research, a plan was drawn up to complete it in one month. The workers automatically worked from ten to twelve hours under their own goals, and the machine was running in 29 days. Engineer Chen said: "I didn't believe in the power of the workers in the past, but today I understand that the workers are extraordinary." After the leadership ideology also changed, such as repairing the side legs of the boiler kiln, the original plan was three meters wide, but the workers put forward their opinions based on their experience, believing that three meters wide could not support it. After the leadership studied the original plan, it was indeed wrong, so it was widened to three and a half meters. Accepting the lessons of the waste of materials and loss of furniture during the construction of the 320 Kilowatt power plant, the workers automatically put forward the slogan of "saving materials and cherishing tools." When the project was completed, except for a small part of the furniture being damaged, nothing was lost. In the past, each cubic meter of stone used seven kilograms of explosives, but this time it only used an average of three and a half kilograms. When repairing the 320 Kilowatt power plant, the edge of the forged stone was not correct, and the kiln had problems, but this time there were no problems. The power of the working masses was brought into play. Therefore, every plan had a reliable guarantee. In terms of technical research and improvement, such as a steam blade of a 5,000 Kilowatt motor being damaged, several engineers could not do anything about it, and some advocated removing it. The piece was a twelve-inch-long thin blade that rotated three thousand times per minute. If it were removed, it would greatly increase the inertia of the machine. Therefore, when there was no way, the workers excitedly said: "Are we so many people eating millet for nothing!" They firmly advocated repairing it. At the beginning, some advocated opening it from above, and some advocated opening it from the side to take out the broken blade. In the end, it was not opened, and it was taken out one by one from the original small hole. However, it was too difficult to rivet it back on after taking it out. Its quality was so hard that it could not be filed with wind steel. The workers tried it again and again day and night, hammering it slowly with a small hammer. The more they hammered, the hotter it became, and finally it could be riveted together when it was hot, but it was difficult to find the damaged blades, so they used a tightening machine to pull them together. In this way, it was repaired in eight days and has been running very well for two months. In the past, because the fire bed was large, coal was wasted. After eight days and nights of research by 30 people in the boiler room, they transformed and reduced the width of the fire bed, reducing the coal consumption from 3.7 kilograms to 2.3 kilograms per kilowatt-hour. They also made improvements in the firing technology, which greatly reduced coal consumption. With the development of democracy, the success and failure inspection committee was organized, and a powerful connecting band was also connected between the work of each department. For example, the work of repairing the chimney, a part of which was done by people who were beautiful on the outside but not good on the inside, was raised by inspection committee member Wei Tiancai, and everyone agreed to rework it. For example, when workers Zhao Qinghai and Xiao Hu heard that the sound of the machine was wrong when it was running, it was not their responsibility, but they immediately checked it and found that a serious fault was about to occur, and immediately started repairing it. There were three large water gates in the yard, which required the strength of fifty people to move one. These were left by the enemy, and everyone was used to seeing them in the past, and no one paid attention to them, but after the inspection committee suggested it, the warehouse cleaned them up and said: "We don't need it today, but we will need it in the future." This aroused the warehouse's great attention to collecting and protecting materials. When cleaning up, the outer skin of the piece was already oxidized and damaged. Others, such as riveter Sun Baoyuan, collected and used all the waste materials and tools accumulated in the factories of capitalists and enemies over the years. Outer line electrician Jin Shenhe sacrificed his life at home due to hemoptysis. The day after his death, his father took a pair of pliers to the power plant and said: "Xiao He said when he was dying that these pliers were borrowed from the public, and he told me to return them to the public..." At that time, the comrade in charge was so moved that he didn't know what to say in reply. "The power plant is home, and you are the master of the power plant," has been deeply realized by the workers in the implementation of democratic management, and all aspects of the power plant have been consolidated.
    For several months, the 450 employees have been working together in unity. Once the workers receive the calls and resolutions of the company and the factory committee, they fully implement them. For example, the recent restoration of the chimney of the 500 Kilowatt power plant was required to be completed in half a month, and it was completed in half a month, eliminating the phenomenon of the upper level calling and the lower level not moving in the past. Therefore, when an engineer team came to visit some time ago, one of them said: "Your workers don't need to be managed, I really don't understand." Secondly, there used to be disunity between technical and labor workers. For example, technical personnel thought, "What do labor workers know?" and looked down on the workers. Now everyone is working hard to build their own power plant and completely changed the old set. In order to do their work better, the workers are working hard to learn technology. For example, those who were illiterate in arithmetic have learned the addition and subtraction of several digits. Some literate people such as Zhang Baojin and Li Gongming are already learning fractions and algebra. Technical personnel with theory are learning practical experience from the workers. For example, technical personnel Pei Sheng's room is crowded with workers every time he gets off work, and everyone is very active.

    五千电厂的民主管理
    本报记者  苏幼民
    五千电厂是峰峰煤矿最大的电力站之一，共有职工四百五十人，去年十二月建立的，在今年大生产运动中，无论在节省材料提高技术，增加生产等方面，均得到了很大的成绩。在这次总结入春三个月生产竞赛中，为全矿七个厂的职工代表所共同承认的。这是他们在正确解决了行政、工会、支部三者的工作关系之后得到的。但他们是经过了曲折道路的，远在二百电厂与去年三百二电厂复厂时，既缺乏有经验有技术的工程人员，又加上计划不周密，及一部份工人中存在着雇佣观点，结果使已经建筑起来的土木工程出了毛病，机器装上了不能用，浪费了器材，推迟了送电时间，相互间意见纷纷。这主要因为没有大力依靠了工人，发挥与组织工人的积极性。虽然自峰峰解放后在备战中工人搬藏机器，困难条件下恢复生产，工人献器材献工具等，这已经说明依靠了工人的力量、智慧、热情才完成了各该阶段的任务，但是他们还是不能明确到这一点。接受已往教训，首先由领导干部明确了，工人也逐步提高觉悟，从去年十二月五千建厂起，直到目前刚刚完成的五百电厂的复工，在建厂委员会中间，每一个局部工程，有建筑委员会一种技术制度，有细则研究会；复厂以后在决定重大的问题，工厂管理委员会之外，各部门间又有广泛的群众代表组成功过检查委员会。组织形式上随着每时期的不同任务而建立着，因为领导思想与工人提高的过程，也曾经过诸多挫折，但最后终于摸索出了这个建设中的唯一道路。首先一件工作任务，领导提出大家来讨论具体制订，五千电厂建厂时开始据陈工程师根据现有的材料、机器、人力计算需三个月至三个半月才能送电，如真这样就要大大耽搁生产，但在发动了工人讨论研究之后，却订了一个月完成的计划。工人们在自己的目标下自动加工由十时到十二小时，二十九天机器就转开了。陈工程师说：“我过去是不相信工人的力量的，今天我算了解了工人就是不得了。”领导思想也有了转变以后，如修锅炉窑洞的边腿，原计划三咪宽，工人根据经验提出了意见，认为，三咪宽支持不住，后经领导上研究原计划确实错了，于是加宽为三咪五。接受了三百二电厂建厂时浪费材料丢失家具的教训，工人自动提出“节省材料爱护工具”的口号，待工程告竣，家具除少部份损坏外，一件没有丢失。取石头过去每立咪用炸药七斤，这次只用到平均三斤半。修三百二电厂时因为锻石头缘口不对，窑洞出了毛病，这次就没有出毛病。工人群众的力量被发挥了。因此件件计划都有了可靠的保证。在技术的研究改进方面，如五千电机的一个汽叶子坏了，几位工程师也没办法，有的主张铲去。该件系十二英寸长的薄叶，一分钟转三千周，假若铲去，那会给机器增加很大的堕性，因此在没有办法中工人们奋激的说：“难道咱们这许多人就白吃小米啦！”坚决主张修理，开始有的主张说从上面开口，有的说从旁面开口，把坏的泡叶取出来。最后是不开，从原处小孔中，一个一个取，可是取下来再铆上，那是太不容易了。其质的坚硬用风钢都锉不动。工人们白天黑夜你试一回，我试一回，用小锤慢慢打，越打越热最后把它打热了是可以铆合上了，可是许多叶子难以寻出坏的，又用了紧线机拢着，这样八天就修理上了，已经用工两个月运转的很好。过去因为火床大，浪费了煤，锅炉房三十人经过八天日以继夜的研究后，改造缩小了火床的宽面，而使原发一度电需煤三·七公斤减到二·三公斤，而且在烧火技术也作了改进，大大减省了煤炭。随着民主的发扬，功过检查委员会组织起来，还在各部的工作之间，联接上一条有力的级带，如修烟筒的工作，一部份系人做的外面漂亮、里面不好，检查委员魏天才提出了，大家同意进行翻工。如工人赵清海和小胡，当机器运转时听着声音不对，本不是他的责任，即刻进行了检查发现了将要发生严重故障，即刻动手修理。院里有三个大水门，需由五十人的力量才能搬动一个，这是敌人丢下的，过去大家看惯了，谁也没去管他，但在检查委员会建议后，仓库收拾起来了说：“今天不用将来要用。”引起了仓库对收集爱护材料的很大注意，当收拾时该件外皮已有氧化损伤，其他如铆工孙宝元把历年来资本家与敌人工厂里积存下来的废材料工具他都收拾起来用了。外线电工金申和因吐血症牺牲到家里，他死后的第二天他父亲拿着一把钳子到电厂来说：“小和临死的时候说，这把钳子是他从公家领的，他叫我一定还公家……。”当时负责同志感动的不知道该说什么话来答复。“电厂就是家，自己是电厂的主人”，已在民主管理的实施里，为工人们所深深体会着，电厂各方面都巩固起来了。
    几月来四百五十名职工，一直团结着工作着，工人一接到公司与工厂委员会号召决议后就全力执行。如最近修复五百电厂的烟筒，要求半月完成，半月就完成了，消灭了过去上边号召下边不动的现象。所以前些时某工程师队来参观时，有一位就说：“你们的工人不用人管理，我实在不理解。”其次技术与劳动工人，以前是存在着不团结的现象，如技术人员认为“劳动工人会个什么？”而看不起工人，现在大家都为了建设自己电厂努力完全改变了过去那一套。工人为了把自己的工作做得更好，努力的学习着技术，如算术科不识字的已经学会了几位的加减。有的识字的如张宝金、李功名已经在学分数代数，有理论的技术人员向工人们学习实际经验，如技术人员培生每一下班屋里就挤满了工人，大家很活跃。
