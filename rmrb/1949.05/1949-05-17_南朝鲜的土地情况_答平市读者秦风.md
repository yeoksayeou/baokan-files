    The Land Situation in South Korea
    Answer to Reader Qin Feng of Pingshi

　　After Japan's surrender in 1945, the fifteen million people of South Korea, like the people of North Korea, rejoiced and celebrated their liberation. They had established their own democratic government and formulated a program of democratic reform. However, on September 8 of the same year, the occupying army of American imperialism landed in South Korea. The American occupation authorities, directed by their loyal lackey, the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee, subjected the South Korean people to cruel enslavement and oppression. From then on, the lives of South Korean farmers became even more serious and deteriorated.

　　South Korea has a total of 11 million acres of land, and 80 percent of the people rely on this land for agricultural production (more than half of whom are tenant farmers). When the Japanese devils ruled Korea, 60 percent of the land was controlled by the Japanese. After the Japanese were sent back to their country in 1946, the American imperialist occupation authorities, in order to maintain and deepen the feudal exploitation system in South Korea, and to lay the foundation for American imperialist colonial exploitation of Korea, disregarded the demands of South Korean farmers and refused to distribute the land to them. Instead, they adopted a method of selling it at high prices, allowing the land received from the Japanese to fall into the hands of wealthy landlords and profiteers. As a result, the concentration of land became even more rapid. Currently, two-thirds of the 11 million acres of land in South Korea are controlled by landlords who account for 3 percent of the total population. In other words, in South Korea today, 12 million farmers only have 3.6 million acres of land, while 450,000 landlords own 7.3 million acres of land. On average, each farmer has only three acres of land, while each landlord has an average of 162 acres. What an unreasonable phenomenon! Landlords rent the land to farmers and exploit 60 to 70 percent of the total yield from the farmers each year. Farmers originally lived the lives of beasts of burden, but since the American imperialist occupation army entered South Korea, this beast of burden life has become even more deteriorated than during the Japanese rule.

　　南朝鲜的土地情况
  　答平市读者秦风
    一九四五年日本投降以后，一千五百万南朝鲜人民曾经象北鲜人民一样，欢欣鼓舞，庆祝着他们的解放。他们曾经建立了自己的民主政权，制定了民主改革施政纲领。但是同年九月八日，美帝国主义的占领军在南鲜登陆了，美国的占领当局指使着他的忠实走狗韩奸李承晚，对南鲜人民实行着残酷的奴役与压迫。南鲜的农民生活，从此就更加严重与恶化起来。
    南鲜共有土地一千一百万英亩，有百分之八十的人民依靠这些土地从事农业生产（其中有半数以上是佃农），在日寇统治着朝鲜的时候，全国百分之六十的土地控制在日本人手里，一九四六年日本人被遣送回国以后，美帝占领当局，为了保持并加深南鲜的封建剥削制度，以为美帝对朝鲜的殖民地剥削打定基础，因此，他们不顾南鲜农民的要求，不愿把这些土地分给农民，而采取了高价出售的办法，使这些从日本人手里接收下来的土地落到有钱的地主和奸商手里，因此土地的集中就更为迅速。现在南鲜的一千一百万英亩的土地中有三分之二为占全人口百分之三的地主所掌握，也就是说，现在的南朝鲜，一千二百万农民，他们只有土地三百六十万英亩，而四十五万地主却占有土地七千三百万英亩，农民平均每人有土地三亩而地主每人平均却有一百六十二亩。这是多么不合理的现象！地主把土地租给农民，每年要向农民剥削全部产量的百分之六十至七十。农民原来就过着牛马的生活，但自美帝占领军进入南鲜后，这种牛马生活已经较日寇统治时代更加恶化了。
