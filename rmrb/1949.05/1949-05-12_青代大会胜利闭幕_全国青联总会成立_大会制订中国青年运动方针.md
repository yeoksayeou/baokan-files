    【News from this newspaper】The First All-China Youth Congress, after eight days of fervent, intense, united, and exciting activity, concluded victoriously yesterday. During the solemn closing ceremony, the establishment of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation was first announced. The delegates welcomed the elected 109 members of the National Committee (including 87 formal members and 22 alternate members), with loud applause and cheers. All the delegates unanimously and enthusiastically passed congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as a circular telegram to democratic youth around the world. To protest against British imperialism assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries in shelling the People's Liberation Army on the Yangtze River and arresting and expelling overseas Chinese in Malaya, the congress issued a solemn statement.
    Subsequently, Ye Jianying, the Mayor of Beiping Municipal People's Government, addressed the congress, congratulating the success of the congress and the establishment of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation. He said: This congress is unprecedented in Chinese history. He called on the youth to unite broadly, actively participate in the production and construction of the New Democratic China, support the People's Liberation War, participate in labor, study science, establish a world view of serving the working people, promote criticism and self-criticism, and cultivate a democratic and non-arrogant work style.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Youth Federation presented banners to the congress. Under the mercury lamps, the five characters "Serve the People" on the brocade banner radiated brilliantly. Military music and applause erupted, intermingled with the impassioned songs of "Cross the Yangtze" and "Fight to the End," fully reflecting the excitement, progress, and enthusiastic mood of the congress. Representatives from factories, the military, and various units came to the stage to speak, unanimously expressing their support for the resolutions and reports of the congress and guaranteeing that they would resolutely implement them. Air Force representative Liu Shanben and Navy representative Wang Shou called on the youth to participate in the construction of the Chinese People's Air Force and Navy. Representatives from literary and artistic circles, scientific workers, the education sector, the YMCA, and various liberated areas in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central Plains, and regions in Southeast China, South China, and Taiwan, also excitedly expressed their satisfaction with the congress.
    Shen Ti Lan delivered the closing speech to the congress, saying: Chinese youth have played and are playing a significant role in the cause of the Chinese revolution. In the future, they need to continue to work hard and bravely advance on the path of the Long March.
    The congress concluded successfully amidst the loud slogans shouted by the delegates: "Youth of All China Unite, Carry the People's Great Revolution to the End, Build a New Democratic China, Learn from Mao Zedong, and Advance Under the Banner of Mao Zedong!"
    【Further News】After the congress concluded, the North China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the North China Military Region, the North China People's Government, the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Beiping Municipal People's Government jointly invited all the delegates to a dinner at the Beijing Hotel.
