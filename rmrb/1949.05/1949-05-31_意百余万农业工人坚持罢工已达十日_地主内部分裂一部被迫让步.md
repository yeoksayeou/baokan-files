　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th: TASS, Rome: Despite the violent measures taken by the police and the sabotage organized by strike-breakers by the landlords, the strike of Italian agricultural workers protesting against the Landlords' Association's refusal to conclude a nationwide labor agreement has persisted for ten days as of the 27th. On May 26th, the strike expanded to several agricultural centers in the provinces of Naples and Salerno. Even the official Ansa News Agency could not but admit that all agricultural workers – both short-term and long-term – had firmly participated in the strike.
    In recent days, many accidents and arrests have occurred in various places in the provinces of Milan and Medina. The situation is particularly tense in the Apulia region due to the police openly protecting the landlords. As many as 1,620 workers in the region have been criminally prosecuted by the police authorities. The police have arrested 120 workers in the province of Bari. The entire province of Bari is virtually under martial law. The Governor of Bari Province has banned all gatherings and demonstrations in the province.
    Despite this police terror, the strikers' tenacious struggle has begun to yield some results, and a split has occurred within the landlords. According to L'Unità, some landlords in Lecco and Sicily have been forced to agree to the strikers' main demands.

　　意百余万农业工人坚持罢工已达十日
    地主内部分裂一部被迫让步
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社罗马讯：尽管警察采取暴力措施和地主们组织罢工破坏者进行破坏，意大利农业工人抗议地主联合会拒绝缔结全国性劳动协定的大罢工，迄二十七日止，已经坚持了十天。五月二十六日，罢工扩大到那不勒斯省和萨勒诺省的若干农业中心地区。甚至官方的安沙通讯社都不能不承认一切农业工人--短工及长工--都坚强地参加了罢工。
    最近几天来，米兰省及麦地那省许多地方发生意外事件和逮捕。阿蒲里亚区因警察公开卫护地主，形势特别紧张，该区的一千六百二十名工人竟遭警察当局提出刑事诉讼。警察已在巴利省境逮捕工人一百二十名。整个巴利省实际上处于戒严状态。巴利省长禁止全境举行集会游行。
    尽管有这些警察恐怖，罢工者的坚强斗争已开始获得一些结果，地主内部发生分裂。团结报报道，勒佐及西西利的某些地主，已被迫同意罢工者的主要要求。
