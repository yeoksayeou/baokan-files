Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: The Council of Ministers of the Korean People's Democratic Republic passed a resolution on the 12th to establish a drafting committee for the Land Reform Law in South Korea. The resolution pointed out: As a result of land reform in the northern part of the Republic, farmers have become the true owners of the land; however, in the southern part, due to the colonial policies of American imperialism and the reactionary policies of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, land is still occupied by a small number of landlords. Farmers, who constitute the vast majority of the population in South Korea, bear the heavy burden of high rents and grain taxes and are forced to sell grain at low prices. The Council of Ministers believes that land reform must be implemented in the southern part of the Republic in the near future, in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic and the government's program. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a drafting committee for the Land Reform Law in South Korea, composed of twenty-one people headed by Hong Myong-hui. The resolution authorizes the committee to submit a draft of the South Korean Land Reform Law to the cabinet before the end of May 1949, and then submit the draft to the Supreme People's Assembly.

  　决在南朝鲜实行土改
    使南部农民也成为土地的真正主人
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜人民民主共和国部长会议十二日通过成立朝鲜共和国南部土地改革法案起草委员会的决议。决议指出：共和国北部由于土地改革的结果，农民已经成为土地的真正的主人；而在南部，由于美国帝国主义的殖民政策和李承晚傀儡政府反动政策的结果，土地依然被少数地主占有着。占南鲜人口绝大部分的农民，负荷着高额地租与纳粮的重担，并被强迫低价出售粮食。部长会议认为必须在最近将来根据共和国宪法与政府的政纲，在共和国南部实行土地改革。所以决定成立共和国南部土地改革法案起草委员会，由以洪命熹为首的二十一人组成之。决议授权委员会在一九四九年五月底以前向内阁提出南朝鲜土地改革法草案，然后再将该草案提交最高人民会议。
