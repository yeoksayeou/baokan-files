Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 26th: Order has been restored in the three towns of Wuhan, and the Military Control Commission has begun taking over. The city's water and electricity are supplied as usual without shortage, and the electricity supply has even been increased compared to before liberation. The ferry between Wuchang and Hankou, although severely damaged by the White bandits, resumed operation three days after liberation due to the efforts of the ferry company's employees who managed to save one ship. Employees of the Pinghan Railway returned the dispersed and hidden vehicles on the second day and formed a locomotive repair commando team and two rush work teams to actively repair the railway. Shipping on the large and small rivers near the three towns has been restored, and daily necessities such as rice, cotton, and firewood are constantly being transported into the urban area. Currently, most of the shops in the three towns, with very few exceptions, are open for business as usual, and trade is more prosperous than before liberation.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 25th: Wuhan workers heroically protected transportation and water and electricity infrastructure, preventing them from being destroyed by Bai Chongxi's bandit troops. On the 5th of this month, the Jiang'an factories of the Pinghan Railway were occupied by a company of bandit troops. That night, the workers risked their lives to return to the factory and drove away all thirty-plus locomotives and twenty-two railcars, and dispersed six-tenths of the factory's equipment in one night. By the third night, the workers had also dispersed and hidden the largest gantry crane garage, leaving only three incomplete locomotives. The workers drove some vehicles to inconspicuous side tracks, and others to prosperous residential areas, making it difficult for the bandit troops to discover or dare to destroy them. At the same time, the workers unloaded all the hooks, levers, and wheels from the cars, stored them separately, and covered the cars with mud to disguise them as broken cars to prevent the bandit troops from pulling them back for destruction. More than three thousand ships parked at the riverside docks were sailed away from the riverbank by the boatmen, some even to the liberated areas, making it impossible for the bandit troops to requisition them. When the employees of the water and electricity plant heard that the bandit troops were going to destroy the plant, they immediately organized a plant protection committee to protect it day and night, so that all the machines were undamaged. Employees of the Electricity Bureau voluntarily formed a picket team, armed with wooden sticks and iron rulers, to strictly prevent sabotage by special agents, and hid and disguised important parts. On the morning of the 16th, a squad of bandit troops carrying explosives entered the factory in an attempt to destroy it, but they were quickly forced to flee by the heroic resistance of all the employees. More than two thousand employees of the First Cotton Mill also organized armed self-defense, drove away the bandit troops' "explosion squad," and repelled several robberies by the "eat-everything gang" composed of special agents, preserving the factory.

　　武汉军管会
    开始进行接管工作
  　三镇水电交通照常供应
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】武汉三镇秩序恢复，军管会已开始进行接管工作。全市水电照常供应无缺，电灯并较解放前增加了供应时间。武昌、汉口间轮渡，虽遭白匪严重破坏，但因轮渡公司员工努力保存了一部船只，在解放三天后即行复航。平汉路员工于第二日即将疏散隐蔽的车辆开回，并组成一个机车修理突击队及两个抢工队积极进行抢修复路。三镇附近各大小河流的航运均已恢复，大米、棉花、木柴等日用必需品经常源源运入市区。现三镇商店除极少数外，已照常营业，交易繁盛超过解放以前。
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】武汉职工英勇保护交通水电建设，使免于被白崇禧匪部破坏。本月五日，平汉路江岸各厂被匪军一个连占据。当晚工人们即冒险回厂将三十多个车头和二十二个车皮全部开走，并将全厂十分之六的器材在一个晚上都疏散了。到第三天晚上，工人就把最大的龙门车库也都分散收藏好了，只留下了三个不完整的火车头。工人们把车辆有的开到不大引人注意的叉道上，有的开到繁盛的居民区，使匪军不易发现或不敢炸毁。同时工人又把车上的挂钩、拉杆、轮子等全部卸下，分别保存，并在车上涂上泥污，伪装为破车，防止匪军拉回破坏。停在沿江码头的三千余艘船只，都被船工们驶离江岸，有的并开到解放区，使匪军无法征用。水电厂员工在听到匪军将炸毁该厂时，立即组织护厂委员会昼夜防护，使全部机器未受损害。电力局员工自动组成纠察队，手持木棒、铁尺，严防匪特破坏，并将重要机件隐蔽伪装。十六日晨，匪军一个班曾携带炸药入厂，企图破坏，当遭全体员工英勇抗拒，不得不很快逃走。第一纱厂的两千多员工，也组织了自卫武装，赶走了匪军的“爆炸班”，打退了由特务分子组成的“吃光团”的数次抢劫，保全了该厂。
