[Ji Zhong Electric] In the fifth and sixth districts of Qingcangjiao County, pear and jujube trees account for 30% of the total cultivated land area. Tree moths have now been discovered. After laying their eggs, they quickly turn into looper worms and bagworms, eating up the leaves and preventing fruiting. In the past, the methods people used to catch these insects involved building soil platforms or wrapping cotton strips around the tree trunks. These methods were slow, labor-intensive, and did not eradicate the problem. Now, cadre from the Advancement Society and Wu Zisan, an old farmer from Jiangzhuangzi in the fifth district, have introduced a new method: Use half sesame oil and half frankincense (depending on the number of trees). First, boil the sesame oil, then mix in the frankincense. Wrap three-inch wide strips of newspaper around the middle of the tree trunk, and then smear the prepared oil on the paper. The insects crawling down and those crawling up from the ground will stick to the frankincense oil and die. One application can last for five or six days, and each person can treat fifty trees a day. Wu Zisan has thirty years of experience with this method, which saves labor and prevents the insects from escaping. Villages around Huangpu in the sixth district have also invented a new method for catching moths: In the early morning, when the moths cannot fly, spread bed sheets (or cloth bags) under the trees, and then use poles to strike the trees. The moths will fall onto the sheets and be unable to fly away. One can hit three or four trees in one morning. This method is less labor-intensive than the old method of building soil platforms and pinching the insects by hand, and women can also do it. In Huangpu village, more than twenty women use this method to catch moths every morning and then return home when the sun rises (because the moths can fly once exposed to the sun). The captured insects can also be used to feed chickens at home, saving the time spent pinching insects under the trees.

　　治梨枣虫新法
    【冀中电】青沧交县五、六区，梨枣树占耕地总面积百分之三十，现已发现了树蛾，它产卵后经短期即变成步曲虫和吊死虫，把树叶吃光就不能结果。过去人们捕虫的办法，都是用培土台或在树身当中缠棉花条，这个办法又慢又费事，也不易除根。现推进社干部与五区蒋庄子老农吴子三，介绍了一个新的办法：用麻子油、黄香各一半（看树多少而定）先把麻子油熬开，然后将黄香混合，用三寸宽报纸条缠树身当中，再把配好的油抹在纸上，爬下来的虫子和地下住上爬的虫子，爬到黄香油处即沾死。抹一遍能保持五六天，每人一天能治五十树棵的虫子。这个办法吴子三有三十年的经验，又省工夫虫子还跑不了。六区黄铺一带村庄，也发明捕蛾的新办法：在早晨虫蛾不能飞时，用被单（布包也可）铺在树下，然后用竿子打树，虫蛾落在被单上飞不了，一早晨能打三四棵树。这个办法比培土台、现打现捻死的旧方法省工，妇女也能作。黄铺村就有二十多个妇女每天早晨按这个办法捕捉，太阳出来即回家（因蛾被太阳一晒就能飞）。捉住的虫，到家还可喂鸡，又省得在树下捻虫耽误工夫。
