To the Editor:

I have the following questions regarding tax terms, please provide answers:

I. What are "income tax," "profit tax," "comprehensive income tax," "inheritance tax," "stamp tax," "goods tax," "mineral tax," and "business tax"?

II. What tax procedures are required for cigarettes from production to the consumer?

Comrade Gao Shen from the North China Military-Educational Workers' Corps:

The inquiry about tax issues that was forwarded by the People's Daily supplement editorial department on April 28th is answered as follows:

(I) Explanation of terms:

　　Income Tax – Taxpayers regularly pay a certain amount of tax to the government based on their income situation (i.e., based on the amount of income and ability to pay). For example, people working in factories and government offices must regularly pay salary and wage income tax, and people engaged in industry and commerce must regularly pay industrial and commercial income tax, etc. The tax rate is generally progressive. For example, the industrial and commercial income tax levied in the old liberated areas started at 5% and went up to a maximum of 25%. After industrialists and businessmen pay income tax, they no longer have to pay national tax, just like farmers pay agricultural tax.

　　Profit Tax – People engaged in industry and commerce pay taxes to the government periodically based on the amount of their income, which is called profit tax, also known as business profit income tax. This tax is a type of income tax and can be combined with income tax for collection.

　　Comprehensive Income Tax – An individual's income may come from more than one source. For example, they may rent out real estate and also work in an office with a salary income. After income tax is levied on each type of income, all income is added together for a second income tax levy. This is called comprehensive income tax. Some countries only add all income together and levy comprehensive income tax, without separate levies. The Kuomintang claimed that this tax was intended to balance the burden and make the wealthy pay more; however, in reality, bureaucratic capitalists and big capitalists often colluded with tax bureau personnel to falsely report or conceal income to evade taxes. The annual revenue collected was minimal, making it a mere formality. In reality, it was also a heavy tax, and our government is studying whether to abolish this tax.

　　Inheritance Tax – After a person dies, their property will be inherited by others. At this time, the heirs are taxed according to the amount of inheritance they receive. This is called inheritance tax. Inheriting property is unearned income, and levying taxes on it is reasonable. The People's Government is currently investigating and studying how to make this tax the most reasonable tax.

　　Stamp Tax – Various documents, certificates, contracts, and similar items must have sufficient stamps affixed in accordance with government regulations to prove their ownership. Thus, buying stamps and affixing them to documents and certificates to replace tax payments is called stamp tax. Stamp tax is affixed by the owners of the documents and certificates, and the tax rate is very low. The Kuomintang's stamp tax was very complicated, with many categories, and almost every piece of paper had to be stamped. Our government is studying simple and reasonable stamp taxes to replace it.

　　Goods Tax – Factories that manufacture general commodities, such as cigarette, yarn, coal, and iron factories, pay a certain tax based on the quantity or price of the finished product after processing the raw materials. This is called goods tax. Although this tax is paid by the producer, in reality, it is borne by the consumer due to the transfer of costs. Our policy is to levy less or no tax on essential goods for the masses and to levy high taxes on non-essential consumer goods (such as alcohol, tobacco, etc.) and disguised luxury goods.

　　Mineral Tax – Tax is levied on people engaged in mining operations based on the amount of minerals produced. This is called mineral tax. The collection procedure is very simple, and the tax revenue is large, making it an important type of tax.

　　Business Tax – People engaged in various industries and businesses pay a certain amount of tax to the government periodically based on their turnover or capital. This is called business tax. Levying business tax after levying business income tax is actually a heavy tax, and the government plans not to levy this tax.

(II) On the issue of cigarette tax payment:

　　After cigarette manufacturers pay goods tax, they can sell the cigarettes to merchants without paying any further taxes. However, people who operate cigarette factories and sell cigarettes need to pay industrial and commercial income tax.

### 关于各种税收名词解释

1949-05-18

专栏：

　　关于各种税收名词解释编辑同志兹有以下几个问题，请予解答：
    一、什么叫“所得税”“利得税”“综合所得税”“遗产税”“印花税”“货物税”“矿产税”“营业税”？
    二、纸烟自生产到消费者手中，须经那些纳税手续？
    　华北区军教工团高深高深同志：
    四月二十八号由人民日报副刊编辑部转来所提关于租税问题一件，今作复如下：
　　（一）名词的解释
    所得税——按照收入情况的不同（即是按照所得额的多少负担能力的大小。）定期向政府缴纳一定的税款，就叫做所得税。例如在工厂机关里工作的人须定期向政府纳薪给工资所得税，经营工商业的人，定期向政府纳工商业所得税等等。税率一般是累进的，如老解放区征的工商业所得税，由百分之五起征，最高至百分之二十五。工商业者负担了所得税后，就不再负担国税了，和农民农业税一样。
    利得税——经营工商业的人按期按他所得的多少，向政府缴纳税金，叫做利得税，也叫做营利事业所得税。这个税既为所得税的一种，与所得税可以合并征收。
    综合所得税——一个人收入来源不仅是一类，例如他可以将房地租出去，同时又到机关里工作，有薪金收入。按他的各类所得征收所得税后，再将他的全部所得加在一起重征一次所得税，叫做综合所得税。有些国家只将他的全部所得加在一起，征收综合所得税，不再分类征收。这个税国民党虽曾口头上说是为了平衡负担，叫富有者多出些钱；实际上官僚资本家与大资本家们，多是与税局人员狼狈为奸，虚报、匿报，惯会逃避纳税，每年征到的数字寥寥无几，空有虚名，实际也是一种重税，咱们政府正研究，不征这种税。
    遗产税——一个人死亡后，他的财产将被别人继承，这时对继承人按照他所继承的遗产多少来课税，叫做遗产税。继承遗产是不劳而获的，征税是合理的。人民政府现正在调查研究，希望将这个税变成最合理的税。
    印花税——各种文书、凭证、契约等类东西，应按照政府规定贴足印花，才能证明他的所有权。这样，买印花贴在文书、凭证上，代替缴纳税款，叫做印花税。印花税由文书、凭证所有人贴，税率很低。国民党的印花税很复杂，名目繁多，几乎无纸不贴花，我们政府正研究简易的、合理的印花税来代替它。
    货物税——制造一般商品的工厂，如纸烟、纱、煤、铁等工厂，在他把原料制成成品后，按照成品的数量或价格来课一定的税，叫做货物税。这种税虽由生产者缴纳，实际上，因转嫁的关系，由消费的人来负担。我们的政策是对人民大众生活必需品少征或不征，对消费品（酒烟等）化装奢侈品等，非必需品就要征很高的税。
    矿产税——按照出产矿物多少，向经营矿窑的人课税，叫做矿产税。征收手续很简便，税收数字也大，是重要的一种税。
    营业税——经营各种工商业的人，按他的营业额或资本额，按期向政府缴纳一定税款叫做营业税。课了营业所得税，再课营业税，实际是重税，政府计划不征这种税。
　　（二）关于纸烟纳税问题
    纸烟由厂商缴纳货物税后，就可转卖到商人手中，不再重征任何税。但是经营纸烟厂的人与贩卖纸烟的人，需要纳工商业所得税。
