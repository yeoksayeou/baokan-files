    On Reforming Old Operas
    Qin Zhaoyang

    Editor's Note: Reforming old operas and innovating through them is an important issue in current literary and artistic work. Therefore, we have successively published Comrade Meng Geng's "How to Reform Old Operas?" and Comrade Qin Zhaoyang's "On Reforming Old Operas." The viewpoints of the two are completely different: the former believes that Peking Opera can not only be reformed, but also can perform new content dramas and "serve realistic political tasks." The Shijiazhuang Peking Opera Troupe has staged more than a dozen new historical dramas, all of which have achieved good results. The latter believes that Peking Opera is "formalized to the point of solidification" and "difficult to reform"! In order to further study the principles, methods, and steps of reforming old operas, quickly carry out this work, and achieve the goal of promoting the old and bringing forth the new, we hope that comrades in the literary and artistic circles (especially literary and artistic workers who have researched drama and the transformation of folk art and are interested in it) will enthusiastically participate in this debate.

    I. On the Development Law of Old Art

    In feudal society, all art forms initially originated from the folk, which is an undeniable fact. However, because the people in feudal society (mainly peasants, followed by handicraftsmen and small citizens) were not born as conscious revolutionary classes, on the one hand, they were exploited and oppressed by the feudal ruling class and had spontaneous revolutionary demands against feudalism; on the other hand, they were small producers, supporters of the individual economy and the private ownership system; in this way, they themselves also had the ideological basis for being ruled and exploited by the aristocratic class, which is the contradiction in their class attributes.

    This situation is similarly reflected in the emergence and development of old folk art. The so-called old folk art has a dual nature: firstly, it reflects the lives and thoughts of the oppressed. There are two components in this, one is the healthy component, expressing their pain and resistance; the other is the unhealthy component, expressing fatalism, karma, the salvation of suffering by gods, Buddhas and honest officials, and the inferiority complex of "little people," etc.; this aspect of art, whether healthy or unhealthy, is relatively lively and has a sense of real life in form. The second aspect is the conscious or unconscious praise of the privileges of the ruling class and their personality, mostly drawn from the ruling class's historical classics and legends of characters, which is the worst part of the old folk art. In form, because it reflects lives and characters that people are not familiar with and are idolized, it is very formalistic and formulaic.

    This latter aspect of art mostly involves the participation of old artists and down-and-out scholars who have received considerable feudal education in the creative process. These people, on the one hand, have close ties with the lower classes and understand their likes and interests, and on the other hand, are mostly hangers-on of landlords and aristocrats, willing to be propaganda tools for them, so what they produce can often be "appreciated by both the refined and the popular." These people also have their own particularly favorite themes - love stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies, which occupy a large number in old folk art. The thoughts and interests of these people are mixed with the thoughts and interests of real peasants, handicraftsmen, and small citizens, which makes folk art even less pure.

    This is the contradiction existing in old folk art. This contradiction gave the ruling class the basis for occupying, enjoying, utilizing, and transforming folk art. They removed the healthy parts that reflected the lives of the people, and strengthened the parts that praised the ruling class and were unhealthy, in order to numb the people and entertain themselves. At the same time, folk artists, for the sake of livelihood and artistic outlets, were supported by the ruling class, catered to their preferences, tried their best to praise them, tried their best to idolize the characters in their dramas, and tried their best to formalize the art forms, to the point of solidifying them to the point where they were difficult to transform. This reactionary formalized art in turn influenced other newly emerging and developing folk arts, causing them to carry toxins in content and become formalized in form, while also being influenced by emerging folk arts, developing further or declining. This is the law of the emergence and development of feudal art and of class struggle.

    II. Local Operas Should Be the Main Focus of Transformation

    According to the above-mentioned law, if we examine old operas, we can find that the more primitive local operas are, the healthier, more lively, and have a sense of real life, the smaller the degree of formalization, the more suitable for expressing new real life, and the easier to transform. On the contrary, the more "advanced" the dramas, such as Peking Opera, the more reactionary, unhealthy, and highly formalized the content is, the more suitable they are for expressing old historical themes and idolized upper-class figures in history, and the more difficult they are to transform. This is the first reason why the transformation of old forms should focus on local operas.

    Secondly, in terms of the impact of the two on the audience: Peking Opera originated in the capital city of Beijing under the emperor's feet. Because the cultural level and appreciation interests of the court aristocracy (Manchus) and warlords, bureaucrats and merchants were not very high at the time, its initial growth was more popular and more universal than other aristocratic dramas in Chinese history. Therefore, it was able to replace the status of Kunqu Opera and fight against various folk dramas. However, because it still has the characteristics of aristocratic art - in content, it is divorced from the real life of the people, and in form, it is formalized to the point of solidification - its popularity is still limited. To this day, the main areas where Peking Opera is popular are still only large cities north of the Yellow River and in the Yangtze River basin, and it is rarely seen in large cities south of the Yangtze River. In the large cities where it can be popular, the audience is mostly idle classes who account for a minority of the population, because only they have the time and economic conditions. As for the vast number of poor people and laborers, few are qualified to support famous actors. Speaking of the countryside, its popularity is even worse. Singing operas in the countryside is mostly during the New Year and temple fairs. The people who preside over the writing of operas are mostly wealthy gentry and landlords. They are ahead of the curve, love to watch Peking Opera, and Peking Opera relies on the strength of these masters to conquer peasants and handicraftsmen, but after decades, it has not achieved much. In the vast countryside south of the Yellow River, Peking Opera has almost no status. North of the Yellow River, it is only more popular in a few provinces around Beiping, and only a part of the middle peasants and above who are relatively idle and small businessmen like to watch it. Moreover, whether in cities or in the countryside, it mainly attracts the audience with its form, and the content of the plot has become an appendage of the form.

    From this, we can see that the total amount of audiences occupied by various local operas across the country is much larger than that of Peking Opera. Moreover, these local operas not only attract the audience with their forms, but also move the audience with their vivid plot content. Its tunes are close to the peasants' high-pitched and indignant and sad emotions, and its dance movements are close to the peasants' daily actions, which can make the audience's joys, sorrows, and anger arise in response to the festival. In the theater where local operas are sung, it is not difficult to see the audience shedding tears for the fate of the characters in the play, but in the Peking Opera theater, even if a tragedy is sung, the audience only claps and appreciates it, and is not moved in their emotions. Therefore, for the sake of the audience, we should also focus on reforming local operas.

    Perhaps some people think that Peking Opera has a higher artistic quality. Isn't it more beneficial for us to transform old forms and accept old heritage starting from the higher-level Peking Opera? But if we think according to the law of the development of old art, we can know that Peking Opera is transformed from Kunqu Opera, and it is more difficult to understand than local operas in terms of both content and form. It has the most formalized parts of local operas, but it does not have the parts of local operas that are most suitable for the tastes of the people and most suitable for expressing the lives of the people. Therefore, if we mainly start from Peking Opera to transform old operas and create new opera forms that express the modern life of the people, there will be many difficulties and we will not know where to start. On the contrary, if we mainly start from transforming local operas to transform old operas and critically absorb the healthy parts of them, after we have achieved certain results and experience, not only can local operas be transformed, but also Peking Opera can be further transformed, and we will not encounter so many difficulties as we are encountering now.

    III. The Issue of Writing Historical Dramas

    Today, on the one hand, the feudal class of Peking Opera bosses is being eliminated, and on the other hand, the new people's life needs new dramatic art, so Peking Opera will gradually decline, which not only makes some new literary and artistic workers issue a call to accept the heritage of Peking Opera and transform it, but also makes many old Peking Opera artists issue a call for reform. However, because the form of Peking Opera is not suitable for expressing the new life of the people, there is also a call for writing more historical dramas.

    The work of accepting old heritage should be carried out in many ways, so it is also possible to write some historical dramas in the form of Peking Opera. However, because the form of Peking Opera is relatively solidified and only most suitable for expressing idolized characters in history, writing historical dramas with new historical views will also encounter serious difficulties. These difficulties have prevented us from achieving satisfactory results in the work of reforming Peking Opera today. I think: in the new era, the decline of Peking Opera is inevitable, and there is no regret or way to save it.

    In addition, in terms of the entire literary and artistic movement, the new is more important than the old, and the mass base is larger. Transforming old operas and writing historical dramas are certainly important, but it is even more important to create operas with new life content. This should be the mainstream of the opera movement. Accepting the old heritage in the creation of new operas is sometimes more free than starting from transforming old forms to transform old forms, and the results are greater. In fact, we have already achieved greater results in this area, created the Yangge opera form and many large-scale new operas, and have already had a profound impact on the masses.

专栏：旧剧研讨

    谈改革旧剧
    秦兆阳
    编者按：改革旧剧，并从中推陈出新，这是当前文艺工作的一个重要问题。因此，我们接连发表了梦庚同志的“如何改革旧剧？”及秦兆阳同志这篇“谈改革旧剧”。两者的论点完全不同：前者认为平剧不但可以改革，而且可以演新内容的戏，可以“为现实政治任务服务”。石家庄平剧院排演了十来个新历史戏，都得到好的效果。后者，以为平剧“在形式上公式化到了凝固化的程度”，“难以改造”！为了进一步研究改革旧剧的方针、方法、步骤，迅速开展这一工作，达成推陈出新的目的，希望文艺界同志（特别对戏剧、对改造民间艺术有研究、有兴致的文艺工作者。）热烈地参加这个争论。
    一、从旧艺术的发展规律说起
    在封建社会里，一切艺术形式最初大都是发生于民间的，这是无人否认的事实。但是由于封建社会里的人民（主要是农民，其次是手工业者与小市民）并非生来就是自觉的革命阶级，他们一方面受封建统治阶级的剥削与压迫，有反封建的自发的革命要求；另一方面他们又是小生产者，是个体经济和私有制度的拥护者；这样，他们自身就又有被贵族阶级统治和剥削的思想基础，这是他们阶级属性上的矛盾。
    这种情形反映在旧民间艺术的发生和发展上也是同样的。所谓旧的民间艺术，其本身就有两重性：第一方面，是反映被压迫者的生活和思想的，这里面又有两种成份，一种是健康的成份，表现了自己的痛苦和反抗情绪；另一种是不健康的成份，表现了宿命观念、因果报应、神佛清官的救苦救难，及“小民”的自卑观念等；这一方面的艺术不管它健康或不健康的，在形式上都比较生动活泼，有实生活感。第二方面则是自觉或不自觉的歌颂统治阶级的特权及其人格的，多取材于统治阶级的历史典籍与人物传说中，是旧民间艺术中最不好的部分，其在形式上，由于是反映人民所不熟习的生活和人物，是偶像化了的人物，所以非常的形式主义和公式化。
    这后一方面的艺术，在创作过程中，多半是有受过相当封建教育的旧艺人和落魄文人参加的，这种人一方面与下层人民有密切的联系，懂得他们的爱好和趣味，一方面多是地主贵族们的帮闲者，甘心替他们作宣传工具，所以他们弄出来的东西往往能够“雅俗共赏”。这种人还有他们自己特别爱好的题材——才子佳人的恋爱故事，在旧民间艺术中占很大数量。这类人的思想趣味和真正农民、手工业者、小市民的思想趣味渗和在一起，就更使得民间艺术不是那么单纯了。
    这就是旧民间艺术中的矛盾存在。这种矛盾使得统治阶级有了占有、享受、和利用并改造民间艺术的基础，他们去掉其中反映人民生活的健康的部份，而加强歌颂统治阶级和不健康的部份，以麻醉人民娱乐自己。同时民间艺人们为了生活和艺术的出路问题，受统治阶级的豢养，迎合其爱好，尽量的歌颂他们，尽量的使他们的剧中人物偶像化，并尽量的把艺术形式公式化，以至做到凝固到难以改造的地步。这种反动的公式化的艺术又反转来影响其他新发生和正发展着的民间艺术，使其在内容上带有毒素，并在形式上公式化，同时也受新兴民间艺术的影响，而更加向前发展或没落。这就是封建艺术的发生和发展的、队级斗争的规律。
    二、应以改造地方戏为主
    根据以上所说的规律去考查旧剧，就可以发现，越是带原始性的地方土戏，就越是比较健康、生动活泼、有实生活感、公式化程度小、较宜于表现新的现实生活，易于改造。反之，越是较“高级”的戏剧如平剧，就越是内容反动、不健康、公式化程度高，只适合于表现旧的历史题材和历史上偶像化了的上层人物，很难以改造。这是改造旧形式应以改造地方戏为主的头一个理由。
    其次，就两者对观众的影响来说：平剧发迹于天子脚下的北京城，由于当时的宫庭贵族（满洲人）和军阀官僚商贾等人物的文化程度和欣赏趣味并不太高，所以它一开始成长就比中国历史上的其他贵族戏剧较为通俗、较能普及，所以它能代替了昆曲的地位，而与各种民间戏剧进行斗争。但是由于它究竟带有贵族艺术的特点——在内容上脱离人民的实生活，在形式上公式化到了凝固化的程度，所以它的普及性还是有一定限度。直到今天，平剧的流行地区主要的仍只能是黄河以北和长江流域的大城市，长江以南的大城市里则很少有它的踪迹。在它所能流行的大城市里，观众也大都是占人口少数的有闲阶级，因为只有他们才有时间和经济上的条件，至于广大贫民和劳动者，是很少有捧名角的资格的。说到乡村，它的普及性就更差了。乡村中唱戏多半是在新年和庙会时节，主持写戏的人大都是豪绅地主，他们得风气之先，爱看平剧，平剧就靠了这些主人的力量去征服农民和手工业者，但至今几十年之久，却收效不大。在黄河以南的广大乡村里，平剧几乎是毫无地位的。在黄河以北，也只有在北平周围的少数省份内比较流行，而且也只有一部份中农以上成份比较游闲的农民和小商人爱看。并且，无论是在城市或乡村，它主要的是以其形式来吸引观众，剧情内容则已变成为形式的附属品了。
    由此可知，全国各种地方戏占有观众的总量，是要比平剧大得多。而且这些地方戏不光是以其形式吸引观众，并以其生动的剧情内容感动观众。它在曲调上接近农民的高亢愤激和悲凉的感情，在舞蹈动作上接近农民的日常动作，能使观众喜怒哀乐应节而生，在唱土戏的戏场里不难看见观众们为剧中人物的命运流泪，但在平剧剧院里，即或是唱的悲剧，观众也只是击节赞赏，感情上却无动于中。因此，为观众着想也应以改造地方戏为主。
    也许有人以为平剧的艺术性较高，我们改造旧形式接受旧遣产如从较高级的平剧着手，不是更为有利吗？但如果根据旧艺术的发展规律去想，就可以知道平剧是由昆曲转化而来，无论从内容和形式都比地方戏难懂。它有地方戏中最公式化的部份，却没有地方戏中最适合于民众口味、最宜于表现人民生活的部分，因此如果主要先从平剧着手去改造旧戏，去创造表现现代人民生活的新歌剧形式，就会困难百出，无从着手。反之，如果主要的先从改造地方戏着手去改造旧剧，批判地吸收其中健康的部分，待得到了一定的成绩和经验以后，不但地方戏得以改造，而且也就可以进一步改造平剧了，就不会碰到象现在所碰到的这许多困难了。
    三、写历史剧问题
    在今天，一方面是平剧的大老板封建阶级正在被消灭，一方面是新的人民生活需要新的戏剧艺术，所以平剧将逐渐没落下去，这就不光使得某些新的文艺工作者发出了接受平剧遗产使它脱胎换骨的呼声，并且使得不少的旧平剧艺人发出了革新的要求。但是由于平剧形式不适合于表现新的人民生活，所以就又同时发出了多写历史剧的呼声。
    接受旧遗产的工作本来是应该从多方面去进行的，所以用平剧形式写一些历史剧也是可以的。但由于平剧形式比较凝固，只最适合于表现历史上偶像化的人物，所以用新的历史观点去写历史剧也会发生严重的困难，这种困难使我们今天在改造平剧的工作上尚未收到令人满意的成绩。我以为：在新的时代中，平剧的没落既是必然的，也就无可惋惜和无法挽回。
    另外，就整个文艺运动来说，新的比旧的更为重要，群众基础也更大，改造旧剧和写历史剧固然重要，而更重要的是创造新生活内容的歌剧，这应该是歌剧运动中的主流。在创造新歌剧中来接受旧遗产，有时比从改造旧形式出发去改造旧形式更为自由，收效也更大，实际上我们也已经在这方面收到了更大的成绩，创造了秧歌剧形式和不少大型的新歌剧，并已在群众中有了深的影响。
