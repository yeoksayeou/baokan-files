    Zhangjiakou Water Company
    Installs Additional Trunk Water Pipe
    Saving Over 10,000 Jin of Millet in Monthly Electricity Costs
    [Zhangjiakou News] The First Water Source of Zhangjiakou Water Company originally had three water collection wells. The water gathered in the wells automatically flowed into the pump room, and then the pumps were driven by electric motors to pump the water to the distribution reservoir on the mountain before it could be supplied to the city. In order to reduce the cost of water prices and alleviate the burden on users, the water company added a section of trunk water pipe (over 600 meters long) along the foot of the mountain near the pump room, so that the water from the collection wells could be directly transported to the city without using electricity. This can save more than 10,000 jin of millet in electricity costs each month. This project began construction during the Kuomintang rule last year, but because the workers were in a state of hunger and cold, the work efficiency was extremely low, so it could not be completed as scheduled. After Zhangjiakou was liberated, construction was resumed on April 1st. Thanks to the active work of all the workers and overcoming various difficulties, it was completed at the end of April and began supplying water to the city on May 1st.

    张市自来水公司
    增装干线输水管
    月省电费米万余斤
    【张家口讯】张市自来水公司所属第一水源地，原有聚水井三眼，井内聚集的水自动流入唧筒室，再用电动机带动唧筒，将水抽送山上的配水池，才能输入市内。自来水公司为了降低水价成本，减轻用户负担，曾由唧筒室附近沿山麓增装了干线输水管一段（长六百余公尺），使聚水井的水不用电力，便直接输送市内。这样每月可节省电费小米一万余斤。这一工程，去年国民党统治时期即开始兴工，但因工人处于饥寒交迫状态，工作效率极低，故未能如期完成。张市重获解放后，四月一日即开始动工继续修建，由于全体工人积极工作，克服了种种困难，四月底已告竣工，五月一日开始向市内送水。
