    Learning from the Tianjin-Beijing Takeover Experience
    Taiyuan Takeover Work Proceeds Rapidly

    Personnel Handling Committee Established to Handle Original Agency Staff. Workers Mobilized to Participate in Inventory of Northwest Cement Plant.
    [Taiyuan Electricity] The Taiyuan Military Control Commission has accepted the Tianjin-Beijing takeover experience, and the takeover work is proceeding rapidly. A Personnel Handling Committee has now been specially established, based on the principles of transformation, education, and utilizing talent according to ability, to be responsible for handling personnel from the original Chiang-Yan party and government agencies. The committee was established on May 4th, and in the past three days has handled more than 100 former personnel. Under the leadership of the Personnel Handling Committee, the city's takeover units are organizing personnel handling committees in their respective units to conduct preliminary reviews and registrations of all personnel in each unit and to submit opinions on how to handle them, creating rosters to be sent to the handling committee for local processing; those retained in the original agencies who have already been employed must also report to the handling committee, which will then forward them to the Military Control Commission for review and filing. All personnel from the original Chiang-Yan party and government agencies, except for a few who are ideologically extremely backward and incompetent in their work, will be employed according to their abilities or temporarily placed in research and study groups for training and employment, provided they have considerable work ability and are willing to serve the people. Those willing to study can be introduced to Shanxi Public School. As for those who are old and weak and truly incapable of performing their work, they will be given travel expenses to return to their hometowns. Free train tickets will be issued to places accessible by train, and all necessary procedures will be handled.
    [Taiyuan Electricity] Mobilizing all factory workers to participate in the inventory, the inventory work of the Northwest Cement Factory is nearing completion. The factory's takeover team, on the second day of taking over, began mobilizing workers at a general meeting of all employees to manage the factory, cherish materials, and establish the idea of workers being masters of the factory. Following that, a meeting of former staff above the section chief level was convened to arrange and discuss handover procedures. Among the workers, representatives were elected by group, with each group electing one representative. Before the election, the workers first discussed the qualifications for being a representative: (1) selfless and impartial, usually honest and upright in handling affairs; (2) familiar with the factory's situation; (3) able to truly represent the workers' opinions. A total of ten worker representatives were elected and formed a worker inventory team, participating in the takeover team's inventory work according to the units they were most familiar with. A foundry worker said, "It's good to divide the work this way. I'll go help inventory the iron furnaces." A carpenter worker said, "If someone says that table, chair, or stool is his, as long as I take a look, he won't be able to cheat." The workers also suggested, "People who used to live in Taiyuan City took tables and chairs from the factory for their private use. This is state property, which is our own property, and we must clean it up seriously." The inventory work officially began on April 26th. During the inventory, the workers actively helped inventory all materials, running around and sweating, but never saying they were tired. After five days of effort, the factory's inventory work is now nearing completion. This inventory has shown that mobilizing workers to help with the inventory work is the most practical education for the workers, making them realize that they have become the masters of the factory.

    接受平津接管经验
    太原接管工作迅速进行
    设人事处理委员会处理原机关人员  发动工人参加清点西北洋灰厂工作
    【太原电】太原市军管会接受了平津接管经验，接管工作正在迅速进行。现又特设立人事处理委员会，本着改造、教育、量才录用的方针，负责处理原蒋阎党政各机关人员。该委员会已于五月四日成立，三天来并已处理旧人员一百余人。在人事处理委员会领导下，本市各接管单位正组织各该单位之人事处理委员会，对各单位所有人员初步审查、登记，并提出处理意见，具造表册送处委会，然后就近处理；留原机关已录用者，亦须向处委会报告，再转军管会审查备案。凡原蒋阎党政各机关人员，除少数思想上极为落后，工作又不称职者外，其余人员只要有相当工作能力，且愿为人民服务，处委会准备量才任用或暂设研究学习小组训练和录用，愿学习的可介绍到山西公学，至于年老力衰确不能胜任工作的，将发给路费遣散回籍，通火车的地方发给免费乘车证，并给办理一切手续。
    【太原电】发动全厂工人参加清点，西北洋灰工厂清点工作已将完成。该厂接管组于进入接管的第二天，便在全体职工大会上开始动员工人管理工厂，爱惜物资，树立工人当主人的思想，继即召开课长以上的旧职员会议，布置研讨移交手续。在工人中以股为单位，每股选举代表一人，选举前工人先研究出当代表的条件：（一）大公无私，平常办事廉洁老实。（二）熟悉工厂情况。（三）能真正代表工人意见。共选出了十个工人代表，组成工人清点小组，按各人最熟悉的单位分别参加接管组的清点工作。一个翻砂工人说：“这样分工好，我去帮助清点铁炉子。”一个木工工人说：“那个桌、椅、凳子，有人说是他的，只要我一看他就捣不了鬼。”工人们还提出“以前住在太原城里的人，把厂里的桌、椅搬在他家私用，这是国家的财产，也就是我们自己的东西，咱们得认真清理去。”清点工作于四月二十六号正式开始，工人们在清点中积极帮助清点所有物资，跑来跑去累得冒汗也不说乏。经过五天努力，现在全厂清点工作已将完毕，在这次清点中，体会到发动工人起来帮助清点工作，正是对工人最实际的教育，使他们认识自己已经成为工厂的主人。
