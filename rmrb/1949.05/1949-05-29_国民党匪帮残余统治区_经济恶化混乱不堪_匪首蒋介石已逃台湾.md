Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 28th: In the face of the People's Liberation Army's sweeping advance, the Kuomintang bandit remnant ruling area in Jiangnan, which has shrunk to an extremely small size, has become even more chaotic. Guangzhou once again announced "emergency martial law" on the 17th and carried out mass arrests of citizens. High-ranking bandit officials scrambled to escape by train and plane; it is reported that more than 7,000 people fled to Hong Kong and Taiwan every day. Fierce disputes arose within the bandit gang over the location of the escape. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek has fled to Taiwan. The Taiwan Puppet Garrison Command announced "martial law throughout the province" on the 19th and sealed off coastal ports. The Fuzhou Puppet Provincial Government is carrying out large-scale layoffs, planning to cut four-fifths of its staff, and schools have been ordered to stop enrolling students. The Guilin Puppet Provincial Government is also reducing staff through so-called "leave without pay" methods. The economic situation in these areas continues to deteriorate. Most of the shops in Fuzhou have closed down, and a large number of shops in Guangzhou are also going bankrupt. Citizens in both places universally refuse to use the puppet gold yuan notes. Nearly 60 grain, cotton yarn, and cloth shops in Changsha have closed down in recent months. Chongqing's industrial and mining industries are in an even more desperate situation, with some factories even resorting to dismantling and selling factory buildings to survive. The bandits are still frantically plundering the people. In the financial and grain conference held in Guangzhou from the 17th to the 22nd by puppet acting president Li Zongren, it was decided to extort huge amounts of military grain from the people of the southwestern provinces, with Sichuan alone "requisitioning" as many as 13.5 million dan. In addition, the Puppet Ministry of Education also passed a measure on the 24th, ordering exiled students from various places to enlist in the army and risk their lives for them.

　　国民党匪帮残余统治区
  　经济恶化混乱不堪
  　匪首蒋介石已逃台湾
    【新华社北平二十八日电】在人民解放军各路大军势如破竹的进击下，已缩减得极小的江南国民党匪帮残余统治区更加混乱不堪。广州十七日再度宣布“紧急戒严”，并大肆逮捕市民。匪帮高级官员争乘火车、飞机逃走，据息每天中有七千余人逃往香港和台湾。匪帮内部对迁逃地点曾发生激烈争吵。匪首蒋介石已逃往台湾。台湾伪警备司令部于十九日宣布“全省实施戒严”，并封锁沿海港口。福州伪省府在大量裁员，预定裁去五分之四，学校已被命令停止招生。桂林伪省府也以所谓“停薪留职”办法减员。这些地区的经济情势在继续恶化，福州商店已大部分关门停业，广州商店也在大量倒闭，两地市民普遍拒用伪金圆券。长沙近月来倒闭之粮食花纱店达六十余家。重庆工矿业更陷于绝境，有的工厂竟以拆卖厂房度日。匪帮们仍在疯狂搜刮人民，伪代总统李宗仁十七日至二十二日在广州召开的财粮会议中，决定向西南各省人民勒索巨额军粮，仅四川一省“征借”数目即达一千三百五十万担。此外，伪教育部又于二十四日通过一项办法，勒令各地流亡学生当兵，为其卖命。
