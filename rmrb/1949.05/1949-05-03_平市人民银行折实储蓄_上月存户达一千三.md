    People's Bank of Ping City's "Real Value" Savings: Over 1,300 Depositors Last Month
    [News from our newspaper] The "real value" savings offered by the Savings Department of the People's Bank of Peiping Branch have been welcomed by the broad masses of the people. From its opening on the 1st of last month to the end of the month, 1,303 savings accounts have been opened, with a total of 233,943 "real value" units deposited, equivalent to 23,148,451.26 RMB. This exceeds the bank's original budgeted deposit amount for April (10 million RMB) by more than 130 percent. The number of accounts opened daily by the department has also been increasing. By the end of April, the average number of accounts opened daily in a week had reached 90.
    When "real value" savings first started, workers, students, and ordinary citizens all felt unfamiliar with it. In addition, due to the rampant inflation and deposit devaluations suffered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, very few accounts were opened. After the department dispatched personnel to widely publicize and introduce the savings, and conduct in-depth investigations, the investigation teams also handled savings business on behalf of the public, and the number of depositors increased accordingly. In particular, many workers in various public and private enterprises immediately requested to open accounts after the cadres of the Savings Department explained the benefits of "real value" savings. For example, Guo Shuyuan and five other workers from the Chongwai Oxygen Factory each deposited one "real value" unit when Savings Department cadres went to investigate. After listening to the explanation from the investigation team, 21 workers from the Jinghua Printing House outside Hepingmen deposited a total of 94 "real value" units at that time. Similar situations occurred in the Water Company and other units. In addition, many factories and schools, due to time constraints or long distances, also notified the department by telephone to send personnel to handle the savings. Before the establishment of the mobile savings team, the investigation team was actually undertaking the work of the mobile savings team. In the ten days from April 18th to 27th, one-third of the depositors in the Second Business Office of the department were attracted by the investigation team.
    Among all depositors in April, the occupational breakdown included: workers, students, soldiers, freelancers, teachers, and merchants, among others. Civil servants accounted for the largest proportion, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of depositors, followed by teachers, accounting for 16.4%, and workers accounting for 9.2%. Among the four types of savings (fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal, deposit principal with interest payment, zero deposit lump sum withdrawal, and fixed deposit installment withdrawal), the number of fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal accounts opened was the largest. Among the 1,303 total depositors in April, there were 902 fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal accounts. These depositors were mostly public employees and teachers. There were 263 zero deposit lump sum withdrawal accounts, and these depositors were mostly workers.
    During this period, they successively received over a hundred letters of suggestions from workers and citizens, most of which requested that the "fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal" deposit period be appropriately shortened, and that the amount of each deposit for "zero deposit lump sum withdrawal" should not be restricted or have a flexible range. The increase in the number of depositors and the constant suggestions from many workers and citizens demanding improvements show that "real value" savings has become a concern for the broad masses of the people today.

    平市人民银行折实储蓄
    上月存户达一千三
    【本报讯】人民银行北平分行储蓄部所办理的折实储蓄，已获得广大人民的欢迎。自上月一日开业截至月底，已开立了一千三百零三个储蓄户，存入实物单位共二十三万三千九百四十三个，折合人民币二千三百一十四万八千四百五十一元二角六分。超出该行四月份原预算吸收存款额（一千万元）百分之一百三十余。该部每日开立之户头数目也日渐增加，至四月末一周平均每日已有九十户了。
    折实储蓄才开始时，工人、学生以及市民对它都感到生疏，另外再加上曾受国民党反动派统治时饱受通货膨胀存款贬值坑害等原因，所以所开的户头很少。经该部经常出动人员广泛宣传介绍，并深入调查，调查组并代办储蓄业务，存户随之增加。特别是各公私企业的工人，在储蓄部干部讲解介绍折实储蓄的好处后，很多立时要求开户，崇外氧气工厂工人郭树源等六人，就是在储蓄部干部前往调查时，每个人各存了一个实物单位。和平门外京华印书局的工人，听完调查组讲解后，当时也有二十一个人共存了九十四个实物单位。自来水公司等单位也都有同样情形。另外有许多工厂、学校等因为时间限制或道路太远，用电话通知该部派员前往办理也很多。在流动储蓄组没有成立之前，调查组实际上已负起流动储蓄组的工作。该部第二营业室由四月十八日至二十七日十天中，有三分之一的存户是调查组吸收的。
    在四月份全部存户中，职业区别有：工人、学生、军人、自由职业者、教员、商人等，其中以公务员最多占总存户数百分之三一·二，次多是教员，占百分之一六·四，工人估百分之九·二。在四种（整存整付、存本付息、零存整付、整存零付）储蓄中，开立整存整付户头者最多，四月份全部存户一千三百零三户中，整存整付户就有九百零二户。这些存户多是公教人员，零存整付的有二百六十三户，这些存户大部是工人。
    在这一时期内，他们先后收到工人、市民等的建议信百余件，多数是要求“整存整付”存储期限再适当的缩短。“零存整付”每次存款金额，不加限制或有伸缩范围。由于存户的增加，和不断的有许多工人市民建议要求改善，这说明：折实储蓄在今天已为广大人民所关心。
