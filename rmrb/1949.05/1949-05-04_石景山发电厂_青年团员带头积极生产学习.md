　　Shijingshan Power Plant
  　Youth League Members Take the Lead in Active Production and Learning
    [Our Newspaper] Since the establishment of the preparatory committee of the Communist Youth League at the Shijingshan Power Plant on March 25th, more than 200 young workers in the plant have been organized and are playing a leading role in production and union organization, establishing preliminary prestige among the masses. Bao Zhongyan, a League member in the repair section, united the young workers in the section, read newspapers to them, and explained the policies of the Communist Party. Xia Baoyi, a League member, not only completed his own tasks but also often helped others with their work. When the maintenance section was repairing the No. 3 generator, League member Xi Shengyuan took the lead in starting work early, motivating everyone and completing the task ahead of schedule. Some young workers, who previously had bad behavior, completely changed their attitude towards labor after participating in the activities of the Communist Youth League, and became upright, diligent, and simple. For example, Xia Baoyi used to be lazy and liked to gamble, but after joining the League, with the League's education and assistance, he now does the work of two people, is willing to help others, and humbly accepts others' opinions. Because League members combine with the masses in their actual work, have a down-to-earth style, and humbly learn from older workers, they have united many young workers. Now, five young workers' study groups have been established throughout the plant, and League members lead the learning in the groups.

　　石景山发电厂
  　青年团员带头积极生产学习
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂自三月二十五日成立青年团筹委会以来，全厂二百多青年工人组织起来，在生产与组织工会中起着带头作用，在群众中建立了初步威信。修理股团员包忠言团结了股里的青年工人，给大家读报，讲解共产党的政策。团员夏宝义除完成自己任务外，常常帮助别人作活。维护股在修理第三号发电机时，团员席盛远带头早上班，推动大家，提前完成了任务。有些青年工人过去行为不好的，参加了青年团的活动后，劳动态度完全转变，一个个都变得正派、勤快、朴实了。如夏宝义过去作工专泡菇蘑，好赌钱，可是入团后，在团的教育帮助下，现在干活一人抵两人，而且乐意帮助别人，虚心接受别人的意见。由于团员们在实际工作中与群众结合，作风踏实，虚心向老年工人学习，因此他们团结了许多青年工人，现在全厂已成立了五个青工学习小组，团员在小组中领导学习。
