[Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Shaanxi Central Front, May 28th dispatch: The towns and major and minor stations along the Longhai Railway in eastern Shaanxi, including Tongguan, Huayin, Huaxian, Weinan, and Lintong, were successively liberated from May 24th to May 26th. Simultaneously, the People's Liberation Army, sweeping towards the south bank of the Wei River, liberated Lantian southeast of Xi'an and ＠＠ two county towns on the south bank of the Wei River. Now, the vast plain area in central Shaanxi, south of the Wei River, north of the Qinling Mountains, east to Tongguan and west to Guozhen, has been entirely liberated.

[Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, May 28th] A frontline reporter reported the demise of the Kuomintang bandit army's 57th Army and 30th Division, stating: When the powerful People's Liberation Army crossed the Jing River on the afternoon of the 17th and occupied Xianyang on the Longhai Railway that evening, it advanced fiercely westward, leaving the bandit troops of the 57th Army and 30th Division, defending the Liquan and Qianxian areas, no time to join their main force in a westward retreat. They were forced to flee alone into the麟游mountain area. The Liberation Army, disregarding fatigue, relentlessly pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemy overnight. On the evening of the 21st, they captured麟游County. At about 1:00 pm on the 22nd, they made contact with the main force of the fleeing enemy about 50 miles west of麟游near the Eighteen Ridges. The enemy was in utter disarray. Apart from a portion being annihilated, the majority collapsed westward along the麟(you) and 凤(xiang) highway. At this time, another unit of the Liberation Army had already ambushed the enemy in the mountainous areas on both sides of the highway northeast of Fengxiang, blocking the enemy's retreat. The Liberation Army then formed a pincer movement from the east and west. At about 10:00 am, the two armies from the east and west converged, encircling the fleeing enemy in small areas such as Tanjia Gou and Hangjia River. After about an hour of battle, the fleeing enemy was completely annihilated. The battlefield was piled with captured weapons, ammunition, and supplies, while enemy officers and soldiers quietly waited for the Liberation Army to collect them. According to incomplete statistics, in addition to the killed and wounded, over 10,000 enemy officers and soldiers, including the commander of the 30th Division, Wang Jingxin (who died from severe injuries), and the Chief of Staff of the 215th Division, Xiao Beizhan, were captured alive. The annihilated 57th Army was originally the Youth Army 203rd Division, established in Luzhou, Sichuan in November 1944. In 1948, it entered Shaanxi and was stationed in Qianxian and Yongshou, responsible for the defense of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. In October 1948, it was renamed its current number. The army met a tragic end, being completely annihilated less than three days after fleeing the Liquan, Qianxian, and Yongshou areas where it had been stationed for a long time.

[Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 28th] In the battles to liberate Xi'an and Xianyang, a total of more than 2,300 personnel from the Kuomintang Army's 22nd Army Training Corps and the Xi'an City Puppet Self-Defense Brigade surrendered to the People's Liberation Army with their weapons. In addition, during the operations, a portion of the enemy's 48th Division, 12th Division, and the 6th Security Regiment were annihilated, 2,669 enemy soldiers were captured alive, and two mountain guns, one anti-aircraft gun, three 60mm mortars, fifty-seven light and heavy machine guns, and 2,950 rifles and pistols were seized, along with four ammunition depots.

　　陕中平原全部解放
  　渭河以南克潼关蓝田等七城
    麟游山区之役我军俘敌万余
  　西安咸阳战斗敌投降及被俘五千
    【北平新华广播电台广播】陕中前线二十八日消息：陕西东部陇海铁路沿线的潼关、华阴、华县、渭南、临潼等城镇和大小车站，已经在二十四日到二十六日先后解放。同时向渭河南岸扫荡的人民解放军解放西安东南的蓝田和渭河南岸的＠＠两座县城。现在渭河以南，秦岭以北，东迄潼关西到虢镇的陕西中部广大平原地区，已经全部解放。
    【新华社陕中前线二十八日电】前线记者报道国民党匪军五十七军及三十师的覆灭经过称：当强大的人民解放军于十七日午后渡过泾河并于当晚占领陇海铁路上的咸阳后，便猛烈向西发展，使防守醴泉、乾县地区的匪部五十七军及三十师来不及同主力会合西撤，被迫单独向麟游山区逃命。解放军乃不顾疲劳，连夜猛烈追歼逃敌。二十一日晚攻占麟游县城，二十二日一时许即与逃敌之主力部队于麟游以西约五十里之十八岭附近接触。敌人混乱不堪，除一部被歼灭外，大部沿麟（游）、凤（翔）公路向西溃退。此时另部解放军，已预伏于凤翔东北公路两侧山地，堵住了敌人的退路。于是解放军对敌形成东西夹击之势。十时许，我东西两路大军会师，将逃敌团团包围在谭家沟杭家河等狭小地区。经过约一小时战斗即将逃敌全部消灭。战场上堆满了缴获的武器、弹药、物资，敌军官兵则安静地等待解放军来收容。据不完全统计，此役除毙伤外，计生俘敌三十师师长王敬鑫（因伤重毙命），二一五师参谋长萧北展等以下官兵万余人。按被歼灭的五十七军原为青年军二○三师，一九四四年十一月成立于四川之泸州，一九四八年开入陕西，即长驻乾县、永寿担任西兰公路的守备，一九四八年十月改称现番号。该军在刚逃离久驻的醴（泉）乾（县）永（寿）地区不到三天时间，就遭到全军覆灭的悲惨结局。
    【新华社西安二十八日电】在解放西安及咸阳的战斗中，国民党军二十二军补训总队及西安市伪自卫大队共二千三百余名，携带武器向人民解放军投诚。另在作战中，共计歼灭敌四十八师、十二师、保六团等各一部，生俘敌二千六百六十九名，缴获山炮二门，高射炮一门，六零炮三门，轻重机枪五十七挺，长短枪二千九百五十枚，另缴获弹药库四座。
