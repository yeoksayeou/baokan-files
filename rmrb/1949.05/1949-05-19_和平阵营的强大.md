　　The Strength of the Peace Camp

Mr. Guo Moruo, in his speech at the rally in Harbin welcoming me and the delegation's successful return, said that Fadeyev boasted: "American and British imperialists concluded a robber-like North Atlantic Treaty, and got Luxembourg, with a population of less than one million, to participate, while our Peace Congress got China, with a population of 475 million, to participate!" This sentence reveals an ironclad truth: due to the victory of our Chinese People's Liberation War on a nationwide scale, the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is even more powerful and stronger! Moreover, representatives from seventy-two countries are all praising the Soviet Union and Stalin for adhering to a policy of peace. Therefore, warmongers must also scratch their heads and think before they wield their butcher knives! This is why the U.S. imperialists may have bowed their heads to the forces of peace on the German question, and why the cancellation of the Berlin restrictions is "likely to genuinely become a turning point in the post-war settlement process!"

　　和平阵营的强大
    郭沫若先生，在其向哈市欢迎我和大代表团成功归来的大会演说中说，法捷耶夫夸耀：“美英帝国主义缔结了强盗式的北大西洋公约，得到一个人口不足一百万的卢森堡参加，而我们和平大会得到了人口四万万七千五百万的中国参加！”这句话道出了一个铁一般的真理：由于我们中国人民解放战争在全国范围内的胜利，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量是更加雄厚壮大了！而且七十二国代表都在一致称颂坚持和平政策的苏维埃和斯大林。因而战争贩子们在他们挥动屠刀以前也必须搔首沉思一下了！这也就是为什么美帝有可能在德国问题上向和平力量低头的原故，也就是为什么取消柏林限制是“可能真正地成为战后解决过程中的转折点”的道理！
