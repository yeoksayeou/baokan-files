    Improving Nursing Work
    (Abridged translation from the Soviet Nurse Magazine)

    Improving nursing work in hospitals is the primary key to improving the quality of medical work; it is also the key to further alleviating the suffering of working people who unfortunately fall ill in a socialist country.

    Most people who come to the hospital for treatment have been forced to leave their jobs, families, and happy family lives. They bear the pain of illness in their minds and bodies and are in great need of comfort and care. If patients cannot get a quiet and convenient environment in the hospital, and if the hospital staff, especially nurses, are indifferent to the patients and work carelessly, it will be difficult to achieve any effect, no matter what treatment method is used.

    The central task of a nurse is to constantly make patients feel that the hospital room is better than their own home, whether day or night.

    What constitutes advanced nursing work?

    First of all, all advanced treatment institutions must pay attention to cleanliness and order in all aspects. It cannot be that there are cobwebs hanging in the corners, dust accumulated on the door frames or behind mirrors, the windows are never cleaned or not cleaned properly, there is dirt on the floor, and the patient's bedding and shirts are dirty, and the patient cannot get any peace and comfort; otherwise, it cannot be considered an advanced hospital.

    The nurse in the ward must pay attention to the work of the sanitation worker and strictly require him or her to do a perfect job of cleaning and tidying up. If the sanitation worker's work is sloppy and does not improve after being told, it should be reported to the administrative head. A table and two good chairs should be installed in the ward, and a clean tablecloth should be laid on the table, with writing utensils, newspapers, books, flower pots, and vases.

    Attention should be paid to tidying up the toilets and washrooms for patients who can walk; these rooms must be particularly clean.

    It is the nurse's responsibility to keep the bodies of patients who cannot walk clean. Wash the patient's body very clean, cut their hair on time, shave their face on time, and cut their fingernails and toenails on time. Also, the clothes worn by the patient should be clean and of the right size. In this way, the patient's spirit will surely be happy.

    The provision of nutrition to patients in the hospital is of great significance. A good nurse should be able to choose food that the patient likes to eat (of course, within the prescribed standards). Attention should be paid to the temperature of the food and drink, the cleanliness of the utensils, etc., and hot tea should be delivered to the patient in a timely manner. For critically ill patients, the nurse should personally feed them.

    In nursing work, there are many things that seem to be "small matters" at a glance; but in reality, they are of great importance to the patient. For example, for patients with trauma, neuralgia, arthritis, heart disease, and lung disease, if the bedding is not properly arranged (the patient cannot stand up or turn over to adjust), a careful nurse will promptly tidy up the patient's bedding to achieve what the patient wants; otherwise, it will cause the patient to feel distressed and the disease to worsen. Some patients cannot sleep because they cannot keep their limbs warm; in such cases, the nurse should use cotton or hot water bottles to keep the patient's limbs warm. A careful nurse will not cause bedsores even in the most critically ill patients; conversely, if the nurse's work is poor, bedsores will develop quickly.

    If the patient has not defecated and is constipated, an enema should be given, which is a very important part of nursing work. However, many nurses do not give enemas to patients themselves, but order the sanitation worker to do it, and they do not even ask when the enema was given or what the result was.

    When a patient asks for a bedpan, a clean bedpan should be delivered to the patient immediately. If the ward nurse does not pay attention to these things and does not organize the sanitation workers well, and the bedpan cannot be delivered in time, it will inevitably cause the patient to feel annoyed, and the result will not be "a small matter."

    Nurses should pay attention to keeping the air in the ward fresh and clean at all times and ventilate it several times a day. Some patients may be afraid of the cold and do not allow the vent windows to be opened. At this time, the nurse should explain to the patient in detail the relationship between fresh air and disease. And pay attention to covering the patient carefully when opening the vent window, so that the patient does not directly contact the cold air. Everyone knows these things, and some people think they are "small matters"; however, we must understand that the entire work of the hospital is made up of every small thing.

    The nursing work for patients is not only about doing a good job in hygiene and cleanliness, but also about providing mental comfort to the patient and maintaining a quiet and orderly environment in the ward.

    Of course, providing mental comfort to the patient is partly the responsibility of the attending doctor, but the doctor can only contact the patient for a short time each day, while the nurse is always with the patient day and night. In the ward, the nurse's attitude towards patients and other staff members must be kind, and no slight expression of displeasure is allowed, let alone quarreling and getting angry. Nurses should get as close as possible to all patients, know the pain of each patient, comfort them, dispel their pessimistic thoughts, and give them confidence in their recovery. A happy spirit and confidence in treatment are necessary conditions for recovery.

    Nurses should gain the respect and trust of patients and sanitation workers. Only in this way can they unconditionally listen to and carry out the nurse's words and instructions.

    Nurses should constantly engage in their own professional studies, enrich their theory and improve their skills (when giving injections, they should be quick, painless, and thoroughly sterilized; when cupping, they should make the cups tight and not cause burns, etc.), so that patients believe in their skills. In a day, the time spent by nurses performing various technical tasks is only a small part, and the rest of the time is spent with the patients. Nurses should talk to patients about current political issues, give patients newspapers and interesting books, talk about movies, and sometimes talk about family matters - children, husbands, or wives, etc.

    The nurse's mood should be consistently happy, the style should be upright, and the attitude should be kind. This has a great impact on the patient's spirit; everyone will feel that when the "lovely" nurse is on duty, the patient's spirit is particularly happy, the appetite is increased, and even the body temperature is reduced.

    What does an advanced hospital need?

    Of course, it needs some equipment, a considerable number of furniture, clothing, and instruments, etc.; moreover, in today's world, every one of our hospitals already has all kinds of necessary equipment and necessary items. But this is not the main thing, the main thing is to need people—excellent nursing cadres; that is, nurses who are theoretically and technically proficient and have a kind attitude.

    Many nurses want to enter medical universities after graduating from school and plan to become doctors in the future. Everyone also knows that there is only one country in the world like ours, with many universities, night schools, and vocational schools for working youth. As long as they are willing to work hard, they will surely become a doctor; but absolutely do not despise nursing work because of this. They should deeply recognize the sacredness of nursing work in their minds.

    While improving their cultural level, nurses should consolidate their thinking of serving the sick and injured people wholeheartedly and improve the quality of the nursing work they do.

    Some nurses mistakenly believe that it is enough to complete the work instructed by the doctor, and that the nursing work for the patient is the task of the sanitation worker. There is also the fact that nurses with low cultural levels are indeed wholeheartedly dedicated to caring for patients, doing everything to alleviate the patient's pain, while nurses with higher knowledge are perfunctory in this regard.

    It must be understood that in order to improve the nursing work in hospitals, it is necessary to strengthen clinical practice in nursing schools first. Doctors and head nurses should strengthen political education for nurses who leave school, so that they do not consider nursing work to be "lowly" and can wholeheartedly work for the health of patients. Only those with excellent skills and high political cultivation can be considered advanced nurses.

    Patients are very willing to talk to kind nurses; when patients talk about politics or literature with the nurses they respect, they may even forget their illnesses. The nurse's attitude and appearance have a great impact on the patient. The nurse's body - hands, nails, hair, etc. - must be kept clean and tidy at all times, and the clothes worn should be simple and plain. Only in this way can they arouse the patient's respect and belief, and can they be worthy of being a role model for patients and sanitation workers.

    Strict work discipline, faithful completion of the doctor's instructions, skillful technology, and careful and concerned nursing work; these conditions are the indicators of advanced hospital nursing work.

    Only when nurses deeply understand the importance of humanitarianism can they show compassion and pity for patients in their ordinary work, and can they improve nursing work.

    提高护理工作
    （节译自苏联护士杂志）
    提高医院内的护理工作，是提高医务工作质量的首要关键；也是在社会主义国度里，能使不幸而得病的劳动人民的痛苦获得更进一步减轻的关键。
    到医院里治疗疾病的人们，大多数是不得已离开了自己的工作岗位，家庭和美满的家庭生活，在他（她）们的精神和肉体上都担负着疾病人的痛苦，是很需要别的安慰和体贴的。若是患者在医院里，得不到安静和方便的环境，医院内的工作人员，特别是护士，对患者毫不关心，工作粗枝大叶，则不论是施行任何治疗方法，都很难收到效果。
    不论是在白天或是夜里，经常使患者感到病室比自己家里还强，这是护士的中心任务。
    什么样才能算作先进的护理工作？
    首先是，一切先进的治疗机关，一定要注意到各方面的清洁和秩序。不会是：在墙角处悬有蜘蛛网，在门框上或镜子后积有尘埃，窗户上的玻璃总也没有擦过或擦的不干净，地板上有土，患者的被褥、衬衣都很污秽，患者得不到一点安静和舒服；否则，不能算作先进的医院。
    病室里的护士，须注意到卫生员的工作，应严格的要求他（她）做到尽善尽美的清洁整顿。若卫生员的工作马虎，告诉也不改的话，应向行政首长汇报。在病室内应安设有桌子和两把好椅子，并在桌子上铺以洁净的桌布，放搁以写字用具、报纸、书籍、花盆及花瓶等。
    要注意到能行走的患者，整顿厕所洗脸室等；这些房子内都须特别干净。
    使不能行走的患者身体保持清洁是护士的责任。把患者的身体洗得很干净，头也按时剪了，脸也按时刮了，指和趾甲也都按时剪了。并且患者所穿的衣服干净，大小合适。这样，患者的精神一定会愉快。
    在医院里，患者营养的供给有很大的意义，好的护士，应能给患者选择爱吃的食物（当然须在规定标准的范围内）。要注意到：饮食物的凉热，食器的洁净等，要适时的把热茶送到患者面前。对重症患者要由护士亲自喂饭。
    在护理工作中，有许多事情冷眼看去好象是“小来小去的事”；但实际来说，对患者都有重大的关系。譬如：创伤、神经痛、关节炎、心脏病及肺病患者的被褥，铺盖得不适当时（患者不能站起来或翻身调整），若是细心的护士，她定会及时整顿患者的被褥，达到患者所愿意的那样；否则，会使患者感到苦恼而疾病坏转，有的患者因为不能使自己的肢体得到温暖而睡不着觉；遇着此种情形时，则护士应使用棉花或暖水袋使患者的肢体得到温暖。细心的护士，就是遇到怎样重症的患者，亦不至于发生褥疮；相反的，若护士工作不良，则很快即会发生褥疮。
    若是患者未排便而便秘时，则应予以施行洗肠，这是很重要的一种护士工作。但是，有许多护士不亲自给患者洗肠，命令卫生员作，且自己也不过问是在什么时候施行的洗肠，结果如何。
    患者要便盆时，应立刻把干净的便盆送到患者跟前。若病室护士对这些事情不注意，对卫生员没有很好的组织，不能及时把便盆送到，定会引起患者感到烦恼，其结果则不是“小来小去的事情”。
    护士应该注意到使病室内的空气经常保持新鲜洁净，一天须行数次换气。可能有的患者怕冷而不让开气窗，此时护士应对患者详细解说新鲜空气与疾病的关系。并且要注意到在开气窗时，须周密盖上患者，不要使患者直接接触冷气。这些事情大家都知道，也有些人认为是“小来小去的事情”；可是，我们要了解到，医院内的整个工作，是由每一件小的事情集合而成的。
    对患者的护理工作，不仅只是卫生清洁方面做好了就算够了，同时还得使病人得到精神上的安慰，要使病室内保持肃静而有秩序。
    固然，使患者得到精神上的安慰，一部分是治疗医生的责任，但医生一天只能与患者接触很少时间，而护士不分昼夜总是在患者跟前，护士在病室里，不论是对患者还是对其他工作人员，态度一定要和蔼，不准微有不高兴的表现，更不准吵嘴和动怒。护士应该尽可能多与一切患者接近，熟知每个患者的苦痛；安慰患者，打消患者的悲观思想，使患者对自己的恢复健康有信心，患者精神愉快和对治疗有信心——是恢复健康的必要条件。
    护士要在患者和卫生员中获得尊重和信仰。这样他（她）们才能无条件的听从和执行护士的言语和指示。
    护士应经常进行自己的业务学习，充实理论提高技术（行注射时，要快，不痛，确实消毒；拔罐子时，要使罐子抽的紧，不引起火伤等），使患者相信自己的技术，在一天内，护士执行各种技术工作所占的时间只不过是一小部分，其余的时间，都是和患者在一起。护士，应对患者讲一些目前政治问题，给患者讲报纸和有趣的书籍，谈一谈电影，有时也可以谈一些家庭事情——孩子，丈夫，或妻子的事情等。
    护士的情绪应一贯的愉快，作风要正派，态度要和蔼，这样，对患者的精神有莫大影响；大家都会感到，在“可爱的”护士值日时，患者精神格外愉快，贪欲增进，甚至体温都因而下降。
    一个先进的医院都要些什么呢？
    当然需要一些设备，相当数量的家具、衣服和器械等；况且在今天我们的每个医院里，都已经有了各种必要的设备和必需的物品。但是这并不是主要的，基本主要的是需要人—优良的护理干部；也就是理论和技术高明而态度和蔼的护士。
    有很多护士从学校毕业后即想升入医科大学，打算将来成为一个医生。大家也都知道，在世界上只有一个象我们这样的国家，有许许多多大学，夜学，专科学校是为劳动青年而设的，只要自己肯努力，一定会学成一位医生；但是绝对不要因为这些而轻视护理工作。应从思想上深刻的认识到护理工作的神圣。
    护士在提高自己文化水平的同时，应巩固自己的全面心全意为伤病人民服务的思想，提高所作的护理工作质量。
    有些护士错误的认为只要把医生所指示的工作做完即算了事，而此外对病人的护理工作是属于卫生员的任务。也有这样的事实：文化水平低的护士在护理病人方更的确是全心全意的，一切为着减轻病人的痛苦，而知识较高的护士则在这方面马马虎虎。
    必须了解到为提高医院内的护理工作，必须首先把护士学校内的临床实习加强。医生和护士长对出学校的护士要加强政治教育，使他们不认为护理工作“下流”，能全心全意为着病人的健康。只有技术优良，政治修养高的才能算作先进的护士。
    病人都很愿意跟和蔼的护士谈话；在病人和他（她）所尊重的护士谈政治或文学时，甚至有时病人会忘却自己的疾病。护士的态度和外表对病人都有很大影响。护士的身体——手、指甲、头发等——须经常保持洁净而整齐，穿的衣服应简单而朴素，只有这样才能引起病人的尊重和信仰，才能不愧为病人和卫生员的榜样。
    工作纪律严格确实完成医生的吩咐，技术巧妙，对护理工作慎重而关心；这些条件是先进医院护理工作的指标。
    只有护士们深刻的理解了人道主义的重要性，才能在同常工作中表现出对病人有日情心和怜悯心，才能把护理工作提高。
