    Deputy Minister Liu Calls for Continued Efforts to Transform Wartime Production into Peacetime Production
    [Ping City News] Yesterday (21st), the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government invited representatives from the old liberated areas of North China attending the North China Employee Representative Conference to discuss opinions on future production development and held a welcoming banquet. Invited were more than 50 people, including workers, technicians, union directors, and managers from over twenty units such as the Fengfeng Coal Mining Company, Jingyang Coal Mining Company, Jinlu Coal Mining Company, and various ordnance factories. Among them were Zhen Rongdian, the "King of Shells," and Zhao Musan, famous for manufacturing 82mm shells, both outstanding labor heroes and model workers from the old liberated areas. At the meeting, Deputy Minister Liu Ding of the Enterprise Department, after recounting the heroic deeds of the workers in the old liberated areas who endured hunger, hardship, and sacrifice to persist in the struggle during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, said: "Today's victory was won with the blood and sweat of millions of people. We must not forget this; we must consolidate our victory." He then, based on the spirit of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the North China Employee Representative Conference, called on everyone to continue to strive for the transformation of wartime production into peacetime production. He said, "To build a new China, we must change production in an organized and planned way, just as we used to organize all production to serve the war. It was glorious to support the Liberation War in the past and complete the task; the task ahead is equally glorious. We must transform well and transform quickly." At the same time, he also called on everyone to overcome the guerrilla-style and rural-style approaches to some extent in enterprises, to establish various management and operational systems, and to unite all working people under the leadership of the Communist Party to strive for the cause of New Democracy. Following a report by Comrade Cheng Huo on the grand occasion and spirit of the National Youth Congress, opinions on future production were heard from the employee representatives. Finally, photos were taken, and a dinner was held, concluding at one o'clock.
