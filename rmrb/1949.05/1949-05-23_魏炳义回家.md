　　Wei Bingyi Returns Home
　　When a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army passed through Fucheng County, Hebei Province, the deputy political instructor of a certain company specially accompanied the armorer Wei Bingyi home for a visit. Wei Bingyi's wife had just finished weaving cloth and was about to go out when she saw her husband return home. She quickly took care of the deputy instructor and invited him to sit down and rest. She said softly, "The troops are busy going south to liberate all of China. What's the point of coming home? Since you left, I haven't lacked food or clothing. Life is much better than it used to be!" Before long, the news of Wei Bingyi's return spread throughout the village. The women members of the village ran into the house to ask all sorts of questions, very warmly. Wei Bingyi and the deputy instructor were overwhelmed when the village's Communist Party branch secretary and more than twenty Party members also arrived. They discussed the vigorous morale of the army going south and the enthusiastic support of the people in the rear for the southern expedition. Then, the branch secretary introduced to them the work of the village in establishing the Party and in production, especially mentioning that Wei Bingyi's wife was already a Communist Party member with four years of Party membership and was the propaganda committee member of the village branch. Last year, she was also selected as a model weaver for the whole village. Wei Bingyi listened from the side, his face turning redder and redder, ashamed and unable to speak. He joined the People's Liberation Army in Northeast China in the winter of 1947, and still isn't a Communist Party member. In the revolutionary ranks, he has always been afraid of hardship, always missed home, and didn't do his job well. Just now, when he entered the house and saw the neatly arranged furniture and belongings, he knew that his idea of his wife starving and remarrying was completely wrong. Now, sitting at home, he dared not even speak to his wife, afraid that she would ask about his situation in the army over the past few years. But when they were eating, his wife insisted on asking, "What responsibility do you have in the army?" "Have you joined the Party?" Wei Bingyi's face was flushed with shame, and after a long time, he stammered and answered truthfully. His wife immediately frowned, lowered her head, and said nothing. Neither of them felt like eating anymore. After a while, his wife said to the deputy instructor, "I hope that after you go back, you will help him make progress!" Then she said to Wei Bingyi, "It's been several years, and you haven't even joined the Party. Seeing that the whole country is about to be victorious, you still don't work hard, what are you running home for!" Wei Bingyi was so ashamed that he couldn't answer. The next day, as soon as it dawned, Wei Bingyi said to his wife, "I have to go back. I'm afraid I won't be able to catch up with the troops." His wife only hoped that he would make progress quickly and didn't try to keep him. Before leaving, she repeatedly urged him, "After returning to the company, you must work actively, study hard, and strive to earn merit and join the Party. Then, when you come back to see me again, I will also be proud. Otherwise, I will be ashamed along with you." Wei Bingyi said firmly, "Don't worry, I will definitely earn merit and join the Party in the southern expedition. Otherwise, I won't come back to see you and the people of the whole village!" After Wei Bingyi returned to the company, he immediately made a heartfelt self-criticism to all the officers and soldiers of the company, and his performance in all aspects greatly improved. 【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd】

　　魏炳义回家
    人民解放军第四野战军某部南下路过河北阜城县时，某连副指导员特地陪着军械员魏炳义回家去看看。魏炳义的妻子刚刚织完布，正要走出门去，一见丈夫回家来了，连忙照顾副指导员和他坐下休息，慢声细语地说：“队伍正忙着南下去解放全中国，回家看啥？自你走后，我不缺吃，也不少穿的，日子比过去强得多啦！”不一会，魏炳义回家的消息传遍了全村。村里的妇女会员们跑进屋来问长问短，非常亲热。魏炳义和副指导员两人正在应付不过来，村里共产党支部书记和二十多个党员也来了，他们谈了谈大军南下的蓬勃士气和后方人民支援南征的热烈情况后，支部书记就向他们介绍些本村建党、生产等工作，特别提起魏炳义的妻子已经是一个有了四年党龄的共产党员，并且是村支部的宣传委员了。去年她还被选为全村织布的模范。魏炳义在一旁听着，脸上一阵红似一阵，羞愧得说不出话来。他一九四七年冬天就在东北参加了解放军，到现在还不是共产党员，他在革命队伍里一直怕吃苦，老想家，工作不好好干。刚才一进门来，看见满屋里摆得整整齐齐的家私物品，就知道自己怕老婆挨饿改嫁的想法完全错了。现在坐在家里，简直不敢和妻子说话，生怕她问起这几年自己在部队里的情形。可是吃饭的时候他老婆却偏偏问起来了：“你在部队里担负什么责任？”“入党了没有？”魏炳义满脸臊得通红，半天才吞吞吐吐地照实回答。他老婆立时沉下脸来，低头不语，夫妻俩都无心吃饭了。停了一会，他老婆对副指导员说：“希望你回去后，多多帮助他进步啊！”接着她又对魏炳义说：“好几年啦，连党也没有参加。眼看全国快要胜利了，还不好好干，往家跑啥！”只羞得魏炳义无话可答。第二天刚天亮，魏炳义对妻子说：“我要回去了。恐追不上队伍。”他妻子一心只希望他赶快进步，也不多留。临走时又再三叮嘱他说：“回连队后，要积极工作，努力学习，争取立功入党，以后再回来看我，我脸上也光彩。不然的话，我也跟着你丢人。”魏炳义坚决地说：“你放心，我一定要在南征中立功入党。要不的话，就不回来见你和全村的人！”魏炳义回到连里，随即向全连指战员作了一次沉痛的检讨，各方面的表现大有进步。【新华社北平二十二日电】
