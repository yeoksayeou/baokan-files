Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 19th: TASS, New York—After concluding his nationwide tour of major cities for peace speeches, which began on April 27th, Wallace delivered a speech to 12,000 workers and Progressive Party members at Madison Square Garden in New York on the 16th. He said he firmly believed that the American people would fight for peace based on cooperation with the Soviet Union, and that the American people must oppose the North Atlantic Treaty. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Wallace stated that during his tour, he had spoken at 68 gatherings in 15 cities, addressing a total audience of 100,000 people. At these gatherings, "the American people—realizing the threat the treaty poses to themselves and their men and women, rose up to oppose the North Atlantic Treaty, which is set to destroy their prosperity, freedom, and lives." Wallace said: "We are fighting for peace throughout the world, for building a bridge of understanding with the Soviet Union, so that there can be peace... For these, we will continue to fight, overcoming all difficulties, and I can report to you that what I have seen and heard during this trip is that the American people are determined to fight alongside us for these goals. United, we will surely win."
    Following Wallace's speech, British Labour Party member Hackington emphasized that pure people need global unity and need peace. Hackington pointed out that the Labour government does not represent the true wishes and interests of the British people. He emphasized that the British people do not want war or arms programs and do not intend to fight for reactionaries and big businesses. Italian Socialist Party member Guia declared that Italian democratic forces would strive to oppose any "attempt to drag our country into an evil war alliance."
    Other speakers included the famous progressive Black leader Mrs. Robeson, the president of the CIO Tobacco and Agricultural Workers Union, Henderson, who recently returned from the Paris Peace Congress, and Representative Marcantonio, who accused the Truman administration of failing to fulfill its campaign promises and attempting to impose a war economy on the American people.

　　联合一起必将获胜
  　华莱士等反对“北大西洋公约”
    【新华社北平十九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：华莱士于结束其四月廿七日开始的全国各大城市和平演讲旅行后，十六日在纽约麦迪逊广场花园向一万二千工人及进步两党分子发表演说。他说，他深信美国人民将为基于对苏联合作的和平而奋斗，美国人民必须反对北大西洋公约。听众对此报以热烈鼓掌。华莱士称，他在旅行期间，曾先后在十五个城市六十八次集会上向总数达十万人的听众演说。在这些集会上“美国人民——他们发现公约对他们自己和他们男女的威胁，起而反对势将毁灭他们的繁荣、自由和生命的北大西洋公约”。华莱士说：“我们正在奋斗，为着整个世界的和平、为着建立与苏联之间谅解的桥梁，以便能够有和平……为了这些，我们将继续奋斗，排除一切困难，我可以向你们报告，我在这次旅行中的所见所闻，就是美国人民决为这些与我们共同奋斗。我们联合一起，必将获胜。”
    英工党党员赫金生继华莱士演说，他强调一般纯洁的人民需要全世界团结，需要和平。赫金生指出工党政府不代表英国人民的真实愿望和利益。他并强调称：英国人民不要战争或军备计划，不打算为反动派及大企业打仗。意大利社会党员古亚宣称，意大利民主力量将竭力奋斗，反对任何“把我国拖入邪恶的战争同盟的企图。”
    此外演说者还有著名的进步黑人领袖罗伯逊夫人，新近自巴黎和平大会回来的产联烟草及农业工人工会主席韩德逊及众议员马肯托尼奥，后者指责杜鲁门政府未实行其竞选中所作诺言，而企图以战争经济强加于美国人民。
