Even Beggars Must Produce
    The Ping Municipality Civil Affairs Bureau Formulates Specific Measures
    Vocational Training Centers and Reformatories Have Already Taken in More Than Three Hundred

    [This Newspaper Reports] In order to stabilize social order and enable beggars to participate in labor production and support themselves, transforming from parasitic population into laborers, the Peiping People's Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau has formulated specific measures for handling beggars and is vigorously promoting them. Once the beggars have been educated and placed in jobs where they can produce, a ban will be announced that intentional begging is an illegal act which will be prohibited at any time. The first batch of beggars who are able to work, are not sick, and have no family will be organized into labor brigades, compulsorily given short-term intensive training, provided with food and lodging, and sent to the Yellow River Engineering Team to repair works. As of now, more than 310 people have been taken in at the Civilian Vocational Training Center and the Women's Reformatory. The second batch of people to be dealt with are those who fled from other places to Peiping and became beggars because they had no relatives or friends to rely on, and those who have homes to return to but make a living as beggars. They will be collectively trained and sent back to their original places in batches, so that they can engage in production at home. The third batch will deal with those who have been forced to become temporary beggars due to illness or special circumstances, and help them restore production, business, or introduce small loans. The fourth batch will deal with the old, weak, disabled, and young children in this city who have no support and cannot produce, and all will be sent to the relief center for long-term relief. Those who have a little labor power will be made to engage in lighter labor production as much as possible. The beggar bosses of the religious groups will be banned across the board, educated, and prohibited from taking on more apprentices and exploiting them, so that they can produce and transform their thinking that "the world cannot be made without doing any profession".

    In the past, the number of beggars in Peiping (including refugee beggars) was as high as 15,000 to 16,000 at its peak. During the period of Japanese imperialism, the method of grabbing laborers and deporting them was adopted. During the Kuomintang rule, the method of regular shelter and ignoring them after the expiration date was adopted. Each person was only given ten taels and eight qian of corn flour per day. Because the beggars could not maintain a minimum standard of living and no one educated them, the problem could not be fundamentally solved.

    According to the survey of the twelve districts in the city, there are currently 913 beggars in Peiping, including 580 men and 330 women (522 elderly, 314 adults, and 63 young children), and 214 who are able to work. Judging from the above numbers, although there are not too many beggars in Ping City at present, because our publicity and explanation of policies have not been sufficient since the liberation of Ping City, the beggars think that they can turn over without working. Some call themselves proletarians, and their begging attitude is rude. Some break glass and curse at will. Many can ask for two or three hundred yuan a day. For example, the beggars in and around Dong'an Market have set "official prices" for begging from large and small shops. Gold shops pay 40 yuan, and ordinary shops pay about 10 yuan. The expenses of general shops for beggars can reach 400 to 500 yuan per day, and at least 100 yuan. The beggar problem is mainly caused by the long-term rule of feudal warlords, enemy puppets, and the Kuomintang, which has led to the bankruptcy and unemployment of a large number of people. It is a social problem. It can only be completely resolved by gradually developing production in the future. However, the current bad and illegal behavior of beggars has seriously hindered social order and the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau has formulated measures to deal with it, in order to eliminate it as soon as possible and stabilize social order.

    乞丐也要生产
    平市府民政局拟定具体办法
    习艺所教养所已收容三百余
    【本报讯】北平人民市政府民政局为了安定社会秩序，使乞丐参加劳动生产，自谋生活，由寄生人口变为劳动者，已拟定处理乞丐之具体办法，并正以大力推行。俟乞丐经过教育安置能生产后，即宣布故意行乞为违法行为，随时取缔。第一批处理有劳动力无疾病无家庭之乞丐，编成劳动大队，强制短期集训，供给食宿，给以教育后，送往黄河工程队修工。迄目前止，在平民习艺所及妇女教养所两处已收容三百一十多名。第二批处理异乡逃亡来平，因无亲友依靠流为乞丐者，和有家可归，却以乞丐为生者，集体训练，分批送往原籍，使其在家从事生产。第三批处理因病或特殊情形而被迫成为临时乞丐者，帮助其恢复生产，经营或介绍小本借贷。第四批处理在本市内无依靠、不能生产之老弱残废幼童等，一律送入救济院，长期救济。稍有劳动力者，尽量使其进行较轻之劳动生产。对教徒们之乞丐头子一律取缔，进行教育，并禁止再教徒弟，从中剥削，使其能生产，转变其“无一行不成世界”的思想。
    过去，北平的乞丐（包括难民乞丐）最多时曾有一万五、六千人。日本帝国主义统治时期，曾采取抓劳工，驱逐出境办法，国民党统治时期，采取定期收容，过期不管办法，每人每天只发玉米面十两八钱，因乞丐不能维持最低生活，又无人教育，所以都不能从根本上解决问题。
    根据城内十二个区的调查，北平现有乞丐九一三人，其中有男的五八○人，女的三三○人（老年五二二人，壮年三一四人，幼童六三人），能劳动者二一四人。从以上数目看，目前平市乞丐虽不算太多，但因平市解放后我们对政策的宣传解释不够，乞丐自以为不劳动也能翻身，有的自称为无产阶级，乞讨态度蛮横，有的打碎玻璃，信口辱骂，多者每天能要二、三百元。如东安市场及附近乞丐集伙将大小商号定出乞讨“官价”，金店四十元，普通商号十元左右。一般商号，对乞丐的开支每天有达四、五百元者，少者亦在百元以上。乞丐问题，主要是封建军阀与敌伪及国民党长期统治，造成大批人民破产失业所造成，是一个社会问题。只有在今后逐渐发展了生产，才能彻底解决。但目前乞丐这种恶劣违法行为，已严重妨害了社会秩序和工商业发展，故市府民政局特拟定处理办法，以期尽快肃清，安定社会秩序。
