The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made remarkable achievements in various aspects of construction over the past two years. This is a success of the Chinese Communist Party's correct ethnic policy in Inner Mongolia. Since its establishment on May 1, 1947, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government has led the people of Inner Mongolia in a great autonomous movement, established its own armed forces and a government jointly participated in by Mongol and Han people at all levels, and carried out land reform and various construction works.

	Battle Achievements
	After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army, it cooperated with the People's Liberation Army of Northeast and North China in combat, crushed the Kuomintang bandit army's attacks on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and strengthened itself. In the past two years, it fought a total of 633 battles with the Kuomintang regular army and local bandit troops, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 19,000 enemies.
  
	Agriculture
	In agricultural areas, the Autonomous Government abolished all feudal privileges, abolished the feudal land ownership system, and carried out land reform, enabling the vast number of landless and land-poor laborers in Inner Mongolia's rural areas to obtain land, houses, livestock, and agricultural tools. According to incomplete statistics from nine banners in the Xing'an and Naven Muren leagues, in the land reform, landless and land-poor peasants obtained more than 2,967,000 mu of land and more than 156,000 heads of livestock. As a result, the peasants' living conditions were improved, and their enthusiasm for production was extremely high. Last year, the application of fertilizer in these two leagues increased by 10% compared with the previous year, and this year it is planned to increase by another 20% to 30% compared with last year. The total grain harvest of the above two leagues and the Hulunbuir League last year increased by about 300,000 shi compared with the previous year's harvest of 990,000 shi. This year, it is planned to increase by another 220,000 shi compared with last year, and it is planned to reclaim 480,000 mu of new wasteland. Last year, severe natural disasters occurred in some areas, but they were overcome after the Autonomous Government actively organized disaster victims to engage in sideline production.

	Animal Husbandry
	In pastoral areas, the Autonomous Government put forward the call of "prosperity for both people and livestock," so that livestock gradually increased. According to statistics from the Hulunbuir League, when the league was first liberated on "August 15th," there were about 600,000 sheep, horses, and cattle. By last year, the entire league had newly added more than 200,000 head. The Autonomous Government decided to focus on regular prevention and control of livestock diseases in pastoral areas this year, so that 120,000 head of livestock in Hulunbuir, Xilingol, and Chahar leagues, where livestock diseases are most prevalent, were spared from epidemics. All efforts were made to eliminate the livestock diseases that had already occurred. 95% of the 70,000 livestock infected in the Zhaowuda League have been saved.

	Industry
	Industrial construction in the Autonomous Region has also begun. The industries that have been restored and established include military industry, electricity, iron industry, forestry, fiber industry, printing industry, and grain processing industry. Among them, electricity has been developed in Ulanhot, Hailar, Zhalantun, Zhalainuoer, and other places, with a total power generation capacity of more than 8,300 kilowatts. In the fiber industry, there are nine public textile factories and two joint public-private factories, with an annual output of more than 20,000 bolts of cloth. In the past two years, forestry has sorted and processed 200,000 cubic meters of timber. This year's logging task is 230,000 cubic meters, and more than 60% has been completed. In total, there are more than 10,950 workers in the above industries. Since the establishment of trade unions in various public factories last year, production efficiency has been significantly improved, and some have begun to implement enterprise management. State-owned stores and cooperatives in the territory are gradually developing, and some have played a leading role in urban and rural markets.

	Finance and Economy
	In terms of finance and economy, the Autonomous Government implemented unified revenue and expenditure, established a budget and final accounts system and a regular system of trade tax revenue, guaranteed the supply of military and government personnel, and effectively supported the Liberation War. The Inner Mongolia Bank issued banknotes, which were equal in value to the Northeast Bank currency. This year, the bank issued 10 billion yuan in agricultural, fishing, forestry, and salt and hunting industry loans, and 3.6 million jin of seeds and grain.

	Culture, Education and Health
	In terms of cultural, educational, and health work, according to statistics from the Xing'an, Hulunbuir, and Naven Muren leagues, more than 2 million copies of Mongolian and Han newspapers and more than 200,000 copies of Mongolian magazines and various books have been published in the past two years. There are already 1,904 primary schools and 6 middle schools in various places, with a total of 106,900 primary and middle school students, more than double the number during the Japanese puppet Manchukuo period in 1944. In addition, the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University and senior cadre schools have been established. In terms of health, the Autonomous Government has vigorously led the people in epidemic prevention and treatment. The number of people infected with plague in the previous year has been reduced by two-thirds compared with the Japanese puppet Manchukuo period. Last year, the government provided free vaccination for 450,000 people, and this year it has prepared various vaccines for 850,000 people.

	Mass Organizations
	In terms of mass organizations, trade union organizations have been gradually established in factories in Ulanhot, Hailar, Zhalantun, and other cities, as well as among workers in forestry, fishing, and salt industries. Farmers' associations have spread to various districts and villages. The New Democratic Youth League is developing rapidly, and there are now more than 11,000 members. The region-wide unified organization of students and the region-wide Women's Federation have been established successively.

	The main task of the Autonomous Government at present is to continue to lead the people of Inner Mongolia to step up production and construction and support the People's Liberation Army in the rapid liberation of all of China. In agriculture, this year it is necessary to reclaim a large amount of wasteland and improve cultivation. In animal husbandry, it is necessary to realize "prosperity for both people and livestock," breed livestock in large quantities, and carry out livestock disease prevention.

    内蒙自治区的建设成绩
    内蒙自治区两年来各方面建设成绩卓著，这是中国共产党正确的民族政策在内蒙获得的成功。内蒙自治政府自一九四七年五月一日成立后，即领导内蒙人民进行了伟大的自治运动，建立了自己的武装和各级蒙汉人民共同参加的政权，并进行了土地改革和各种建设工作。
    战绩
    内蒙解放军成立后，即配合东北、华北的人民解放军作战，粉碎了国民党匪军对内蒙自治区的进攻，并壮大了自己。两年中与国民党正规军和地方匪军共作战六百三十三次，毙伤俘敌近一万九千余人。
  农业
    在农业区，自治政府废除一切封建特权，废除了封建的土地所有制，进行了土地改革，使内蒙广大农村无地少地的劳动农民获得了土地房屋牲畜与农具。据兴安纳文慕仁两个盟九个旗的不完全统计，在土地改革中，无地与少地的农民获得土地二百九十六万七千余亩，牲口十五万六千余头，农民生活因之改善，生产情绪极高。去年该两盟上粪即较前年增加百分之十，今年计划较去年再增加百分之二十至三十。上述两盟与呼伦贝尔盟去年的粮食总收获量，较前年九十九万石的收获量，约增三十万石。今年计划比去年再增加二十二万石，并拟开新荒四十八万倾。去年若干地区曾发生严重灾荒，但在自治政府积极地组织灾民进行副业生产后，即行克服。
    牧畜
    在游牧区，自治政府提出了“人畜两旺”的号召，使牲畜逐渐增加。据呼伦贝尔盟统计，该盟在“八一五”刚解放时，羊、马、牛共约六十万头，至去年为止，全盟已新增加了二十余万头。自治政府决定今年在牧业区内有重点地进行定期防治畜瘟，使畜疫最多的呼伦贝尔、锡林格勒、察哈尔等盟十二万头牲畜免于疫害。对已经发生的畜疫则全力扑灭，昭乌达盟染疫的七万牲畜中已有百分之九十五得救。
    工业
    自治区内的工业建设亦已开始。已恢复与建立的有军需工业、电业、铁工业、林业、纤维工业、印刷业及粮食加工业等。其中电业在乌兰浩特、海拉尔、扎兰屯、扎赉诺尔等各地都有建设，总发电量为八千三百余基罗瓦特。纤维工业中有公营纺织工厂九处，公私合营者两处，年产布二万余匹。林业两年来整理与制材达二十万立方米，今年的伐木任务为二十三万立方米，现已完成百分之六十以上。总计以上各业共有工人一万零九百五十余名。各地公营工厂自去年相继成立职工会后，生产效率已有显著提高，有些并已开始实行企业化的管理。境内的国营商店及合作社正逐步发展，有些已在城市及乡村市场中起了领导作用。
    财政经济
    在财政经济方面，自治政府实行了统筹统支，建立了预决算制度及贸易税收的正规制度，保障了军政人员的供给，并有效地支援了解放战争。内蒙银行发行了纸币，与东北银行币比值相等。该行今年发放农、渔、林、盐、猎业贷款达一百亿元，贷种籽粮食三百六十余万斤。
    文教卫生
    在文化教育卫生工作方面，据兴安、呼伦贝尔、纳文慕仁三个盟统计，两年来共出版了蒙汉文报纸二百余万份，蒙文杂志及各种书籍二十余万册。各地的小学已有一千九百零四处、中学六处，共有中小学生十万零六千九百余人，较一九四四年伪满时增加了一倍。此外，并建立了内蒙军政大学和高级干部学校。在卫生方面，自治政府曾大力领导人民进行防疫和治疗。前年染鼠疫者已比伪满时减少了三分之二。去年政府又为四十五万人施行了免费防疫注射，今年准备了八十五万人的各种防疫注射液。
    群众组织
    在群众组织方面，工会组织在乌兰浩特、海拉尔、扎兰屯等城市工厂中，及林、渔、盐等各业工人中，都已逐渐建立。农会则已遍及各区、村。新民主主义青年团日益发展，现已有团员一万一千余名。学生的全区统一的联合组织及全区妇女联合会已先后建立。
    自治政府目前主要工作是继续领导内蒙人民加紧生产建设，支援人民解放军迅速解放全中国。在农业方面，今年要大量开荒，改良耕作。在畜牧方面，要实现“人畜两旺”，大量繁殖牲畜，并进行牲畜防疫。
