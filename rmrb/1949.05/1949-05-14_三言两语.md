Brief Comments

Better to Set Up a Big Pot
　　It's certainly less convenient to set up a big pot to boil water and heat food than using an electric stove. Initially, adhering to the regulations on maximum electricity consumption may feel a bit awkward, but this is not a problem. However, saving energy for industrial production benefits the vast majority of the people and aligns with the policy of transforming consumer cities into production cities. Therefore, the "Hebei Electric Power" Beijing branch setting an example by conserving electricity in its offices is a good example worth learning from for all electricity users in the city. All phenomena of wasting electricity must be quickly eliminated. We cannot sacrifice production for momentary convenience.

A Learning Method
　　Various districts in Beijing have organized workers to study and have achieved considerable success, with over six thousand three hundred workers enrolled. This shows that the vast majority of workers are eager to learn, improve their cultural and political level, and seek progress. We should cherish the workers' enthusiasm for learning and organize and guide their studies well. The experience of the Tenth District proves that selecting appropriate teaching materials and methods based on the workers' needs makes it easier for them to accept and feel interested; closely linking the teaching with their personal issues and explaining the Party's policies makes it easier to enlighten their awareness.

    三言两语
    支大锅好
    支起大锅烧水热饭，当然不如电炉方便；按设电装规定最高用电度数，开初也会感到有些蹩扭，这是不成问题的。但是节省力量用于工业生产，是对广大人民有利的，是与变消费城市为生产城市的方针符合的。因此，“冀电”北平分公司以身作则，节约机关用电，是一个好榜样，值得全市用电户学习。一切浪费电力的现象，必须迅速消灭，我们不能因一时的方便，而使生产受到损失。
    一个学习方法
    平市各区组织工人学习，获得相当成绩。入学工人达六千三百余人。这说明广大工人迫切要求学习、提高自己的文化政治水平，要求进步。我们应该宝贵工人这种学习热情，好好组织领导他们学习。第十区的经验证明，根据工人的要求选取适当的教材与教法，最易与他们接受和感到兴趣；密切联系他们的切身问题，说明党的政策，最易启发他们的觉悟。
