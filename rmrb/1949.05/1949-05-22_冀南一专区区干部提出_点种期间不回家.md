(Report from this newspaper) The Jinnan First Special District has achieved remarkable results and gained experience in the intensive rush-planting and sowing campaign. The district committee's instructions on drought prevention and intensive planting emphasized thorough inspection and understanding of the situation and timely dissemination of experience. District cadres proposed not to go home during the planting season, and competitions were widely launched between villages. At the beginning of the rush planting, some villages changed their plans due to drought, some cadres forced people to plant, and a certain village in Yongzhi County selected more than thirty people who were not active in planting as "loafers" and punished them by having them plant for military dependents. In some areas, the planting was sloppy and perfunctory, and the seedlings died after emerging, leading to a loss of confidence. Thanks to the district committee's timely in-depth inspection and understanding of the situation, the above problems were corrected promptly. At the same time, cadres took the lead and combined with the masses to create experience, such as tying wooden boards to their legs during rush planting, using two seed drills, one in front to loosen the soil and the other behind to sow the seeds, so that the seeds would be placed on moist soil, ensuring easy seedling emergence. Others created a three-layer planting method: after digging the pits, the seeds are placed in the floating, middle, and bottom layers. In this way, if it rains, the seeds on the floating soil can emerge; if it does not rain, the seeds at the bottom can emerge; and if there is a strong wind, the seeds in the middle layer can emerge. They are not afraid of wind or rain. During planting, attention was paid to controlling water sources (using pit water, river water, well water) and saving water. For example, it was proposed that no water should be used for making bricks or building walls during the planting season, and that old wells should be dredged and new wells should be dug in a planned way. In well-digging, methods such as having a wide opening and a small bottom, a rectangular shape, and making grass ropes were created to solve the difficulty of collapsing wells. Because the experience was disseminated in a timely manner, it further enhanced the confidence of the masses, enabling the sowing to proceed smoothly throughout the district, and many villages even exceeded their plans.

　　冀南一专区区干部提出　点种期间不回家
    【本报讯】冀南区一专区突击抢种、点种已获得显著成绩和经验。地委防旱突击抢种点种指示中特别强调了深入检查了解情况及时传播经验。区干部提出点种期间不回家，村与村普遍发动了竞赛。突击播种的开始有些村曾因天旱变更计划，有些干部强迫派种，永智县某村把点种不积极的三十多个群众选成二流子，罚给军属点种，有些地区种的潦草马虎，苗出来后又干死致失掉了信心等。由于地委深入检查了解情况及时，对以上问题均随时纠正。同时干部亲自下手，结合群众创造经验，如抢种中腿捆木板，用两个耧子，前面翻豁土，后面播下种，使种籽放到湿土上，可保苗易出等，还有的创造了三层点种法：即刨好坑后，种籽放在浮、中、底、三层，这样大雨浮土上的能出，不雨底层种籽可出、刮大风中层者可出，刮风下雨都不怕。点种中注意掌握水源（利用坑水、河水、井水）节约水量，如提出点种时期不准用水打坯打墙，掏旧井和有计划的打新井等，在挖井中创造了口大底小、长方形、打草把等办法，解决了塌井的困难。由于经验传播得及时，更增强了群众的信心。使全区播种得以顺利进行，不少村并超过计划。
