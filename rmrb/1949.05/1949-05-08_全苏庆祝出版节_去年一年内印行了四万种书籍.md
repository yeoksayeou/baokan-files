Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Moscow News: The entire Soviet Union warmly celebrated the Bolshevik Publishing Festival and the 37th anniversary of the publication of "Pravda" on the 5th. There are now 7,200 types of newspapers published in the Soviet Union, with a total circulation of 31 million copies, as well as hundreds of magazines and other publications. Last year, 40,000 types of books were printed, totaling 617 million copies, including 26.8 million copies of Marxist-Leninist classics. The 23-volume fourth edition of Lenin's Complete Works and the 9-volume Stalin's Complete Works have been printed in recent years. Many volumes of Lenin's and Stalin's Complete Works have been translated and published in the languages of various Soviet nationalities. The total number of books published last year greatly exceeded that of the pre-war year of 1940.

Soviet newspapers have millions of non-professional correspondents, namely workers, peasants, and intellectual correspondents, who write articles for the central, union republic, state, city, district, factory, collective farm, and all other newspapers. On the 5th, discussions and academic lectures were held in enterprises, institutions, educational organizations, and collective farms across the Soviet Union. Clubs and libraries across the country organized exhibitions.

An editorial in "Pravda" wrote: Soviet newspapers are at the forefront of communist and progressive newspapers in the world. The rapidly developing newspapers in the people's democratic countries are drawing on the rich experience of Soviet newspapers. "Pravda" emphasized: Criticism cannot be abandoned; it is a frequently used weapon in the arsenal of Bolshevik Party newspapers. Intransigence towards various distorted ideas and the fighting spirit of Soviet patriotism – these are the most important qualities of Soviet newspapers. The Soviet Bolshevik Party newspaper is a new type of newspaper, characterized by its party spirit, adherence to principles, truthfulness, and mass character.

    全苏庆祝出版节
    去年一年内印行了四万种书籍
    【新华社北平六日电】莫斯科讯：五日全苏热烈庆祝布尔塞维克出版节，及真理报出版三十七周年。现在苏联出版有七千二百种报纸，发行总数达三千一百万份，并有成百种杂志和其他出版物。去年印行了四万种书籍，共六亿一千七百万册，其中马列主义经典著作有二千六百八十万册。共有二十三卷的第四版列宁全集和九卷的斯大林全集已在最近数年中印行。列宁和斯大林全集有许多卷已译成苏联各民族文字出版。去年全部书籍刊行总数大大地超过战前一九四○年。
    苏联报纸有数百万非专业的通讯员，即工农和知识分子通讯员，他们给中央、加盟共和国、州、城、区、工厂、集体农场的和所有其他的报纸写通讯。五日，苏联全国企业和机关、教育机构和集体农场，举行了讨论会和学术演讲。全国的俱乐部和图书馆都组织展览会。
    真理报社论写道：苏联报纸居于共产主义与世界进步报纸的先锋地位。人民民主国家突飞猛进中的报纸，就吸取着苏联报纸的丰富经验。真理报着重指出：批评是不能废弃的，它是布尔塞维克党报纸武库中经常使用的武器。对各种歪曲的思想的不可调和性，以及苏维埃爱国主义的战斗精神——这就是苏联报纸的最重要的品质。苏联布尔塞维克党报纸是新型的报纸，党性、原则性、真实性及群众性就是它的特点。
