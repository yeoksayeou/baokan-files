The Ping City Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Corporation's Farmers' Hostel (located in the former outer corridor) has added a goods sample room to facilitate farmers' purchases in the city, so that farmers can buy goods according to the samples. Currently, the samples on display include soap, socks, towels, small notebooks, cloth shoes, block alkali, and more than ten other items. Hoes, plows, and other farm tools will be displayed in the coming days. The number of daily guests at the hostel has now increased to seventy.
