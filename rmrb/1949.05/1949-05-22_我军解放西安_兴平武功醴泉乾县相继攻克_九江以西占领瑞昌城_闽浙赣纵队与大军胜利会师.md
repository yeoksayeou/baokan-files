The People's Liberation Army entered the city on the morning of the 20th and was warmly welcomed by the citizens. Xi'an is the largest city in Northwest China, with a population of over 500,000. It is located north of the Zhongnan Mountains and south of the Wei River, with the Longhai Railway running through it. It is a transportation hub in the Northwest. The Zhou, Western Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties all established their capitals here or nearby, making it one of China's five ancient capitals.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 21st: The People's Liberation Army, pursuing the fleeing enemy along the Longhai Railway to the west, successively liberated the county towns of Xingping and Wugong on the Longhai Railway west of Xi'an on the 18th and 19th. Another unit liberated the cities of Liquan and Qianxian on the 18th and 19th respectively.

That morning, when General Zeng Jingbing, the leader of the Min-Zhe-Gan Column, personally led his troops to the southern suburbs of Guixi, Wu Xiaomin, the head of the Second Field Army Regiment, personally went to the Xinjiang Bridge to greet them. The citizens also set off firecrackers to welcome them. The two armies met, exchanged greetings, celebrated the victory together, and were extremely excited. The Min-Zhe-Gan Column persisted in guerrilla warfare in the vast areas of Fujian and eastern, southern Jiangxi, and southern Zhejiang. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they mobilized the people to resist conscription and grain requisition, organized farmers to carry out rent reduction and interest reduction and anti-local tyrant struggles for emancipation, fought many times with the enemy's local troops, and won many victories, and established people's power in Taishun and other counties in southern Zhejiang. In early March this year, it once liberated Taishun City, destroying an enemy battalion. At the same time, it completely resolved the enemy's self-defense team headquarters in Xiayang Town, Shunchang, northwest of Fujian. Last month, after receiving the news that the Liberation Army was crossing the river, the column advanced to various railway and highway transportation lines, while mobilizing the broad masses of the people to welcome and support the southward army. This time, in order to rush to join forces with the main force, they traveled day and night, crossing the high and dangerous Wuyi Mountains, passing through sparsely populated mountains and ridges, and repeatedly defeated the enemy's interception, pursuit, and blocking. When camping somewhere along the way, hearing the sound of artillery from the north, the soldiers jumped out of bed excitedly and cheered and sang loudly, and set off overnight to join the field army.

    【新华社陕中前线二十一日电】陕西省省会西安，已获解放。人民解放军于二十日上午进入该市，受到市民的热烈欢迎。西安为西北第一大都市，人口约五十余万。地当终南山之北，渭水之南，陇海铁路横贯而过。为西北交通之枢纽。周、西汉、隋、唐均曾在此处及其附近建都，为我国五大古都之一。
    【新华社陕中前线二十一日电】沿陇海铁路向西追击逃敌的人民解放军，于十八、十九两日相继解放西安以西陇海路上的兴平、武功两座县城。另部十八、十九两日先后解放醴泉、乾县两城。解放武功时，有武功县伪保警三百余人扣押反动县长陈奎明，举行反正。
    【新华社陕中前线二十一日电】渡过泾水向南进军的人民解放军，十八日在咸阳以北约十五里的新荒、蓝贺村一线，歼灭国民党匪军五十三师一五九团全部及骑四团一部。
    【本报讯】西安解放，北平与西安间电信已告通畅，商电亦已可以收发。
    【新华社汉口二十一日电】在汉口以东渡过长江的人民解放军第四野战军一部，进入江西省境，十八日占领九江以西的瑞昌县城。另部解放军于同日攻占武昌以南粤汉路上的重要车站贺胜桥及其以东的金牛镇等据点，并在咸宁东北的湖泗桥附近，歼灭敌河南保安旅两个营。

    【新华社浙赣前线二十一日电】长期坚持江南游击战争的人民解放军闽浙赣纵队与此次南下的人民解放军第二野战军某部，于本月五日在赣东之贵溪城胜利会师。是日清晨，当闽浙赣纵队领导者曾镜冰将军亲率所部抵达贵溪南郊时，第二野战军的吴效闵团长亲赴信江桥头迎接。市民们亦纷纷燃放鞭炮欢迎。两军相会，互致慰念，同庆胜利，极为兴奋。闽浙赣纵队在福建及赣东、赣南、浙南广大地区坚持游击战争，曾在国民党反动统治下，发动人民抗丁，抗粮，组织农民进行减租减息及反恶霸等翻身斗争，多次与敌人地方部队作战，屡获胜利，并于浙南泰顺等县建立了人民政权。今年三月初，曾一度解放泰顺城，消灭敌一个营，同时，并于福建西北顺昌峡阳镇将敌自卫队大队部等全部解决。上月该纵队接获解放大军渡江消息后，即向各铁路、公路交通线挺进，同时发动广大人民迎接与支援南下大军。此次为赶来与主力军会师，曾兼程急进，翻越高险的武夷山脉，通过人烟稀少的崇山峻岭，多次战胜敌人的截击、追击、阻击。在中途宿营某地时，听到了北面炮声，战士们都兴奋得从床上跳起来大声地欢呼和歌唱，连夜整装出发，去与野战军会师。
