    How Were a Hundred Trolleybuses Completed?
    Feng Zhong
    After the trolley workers of Beiping completed the "May 1st Hundred Trolleybuses Campaign" ahead of schedule, unfortunately, on the 25th, Kuomintang special agents burned down 58 trolleybuses, destroying the gifts of the workers' hard work to welcome "May 1st." However, the workers' creative labor power cannot be destroyed by any conspiracy. The special agents attempted to strike at the workers' production enthusiasm by burning the trolleybuses, but the result was the opposite. The workers, as masters of the new society, turned their anger into strength and retaliated against the sabotage of the special agents with practical actions. In order to build a prosperous new Beiping, they are preparing for another hundred-trolleybus campaign.
    Today, although a hundred trolleybuses cannot be produced, the trolleybus repair factory workers completed the "Hundred Trolleybuses Campaign" plan eleven days ahead of schedule, and the enthusiasm shown during the production campaign and many miracles are undeniable.
    When the Trolleybus Company was established in the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), there were only 60 locomotives and 30 trailers. The lifespan of a car was 15 years, and now each car is more than ten years past its expiration date. When the Japanese invaded, the trolleybuses in Beiping, which had been occupied for eight years, became even more worn out, dropping from over ninety to eight. During the Kuomintang rule, an average of only forty or fifty trolleybuses were in service a day, but because of the rampant behavior of those special figures, a trolleybus could sometimes only sell a dozen tickets. Trolleybus workers were often beaten, scolded, and not fed or clothed adequately. Who had the heart to repair the cars! Everyone hoped that this terrible environment would end as soon as possible. Therefore, when the People's Liberation Army entered the city on January 31, it was the trolleybus workers who first welcomed them at Xizhimen, and it was the trolleybuses that were first restored (on February 1st). At that time, only forty or so trolleybuses were in service each day. The workers who were most oppressed in the past were also the quickest to awaken. Soon after liberation, the trolleybus workers knew that they had become masters and recognized that only by developing production could the workers' lives be improved. Moreover, now that wages are paid in kind, living standards are guaranteed, and they can work with peace of mind. After a month of hard work, by the end of March, the number of trolleybuses in service had increased to seventy-eight. All the cars that could be repaired were repaired.
    In mid-March, the workers of the trolleybus repair factory spontaneously launched the "May 1st" hundred trolleybuses campaign. Initially, representatives of all the factory workers held a meeting, and many people thought it was impossible. The factory was old and dilapidated, and the abandoned cars in front of them, some with only empty frames, where could the scattered materials be replenished? Moreover, the running cars were often damaged and had to be repaired at any time! However, the workers' enthusiasm for production after liberation could not be stopped by any difficulties. After the administration agreed to supply materials, the workers became active, rubbing their fists and preparing to do this work that they thought was impossible to complete. First, the workers' representatives, the factory director, and the engineers held a meeting to formulate a production plan, and completely adopted the workers' opinions, which had never happened before.
    During this production campaign, the practice of going slow in the past was reversed. The workers fully promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and unity and created many miracles. Every shift completed or exceeded the planned quota ahead of schedule.
    The plan called for six commutators. This item used to be purchased entirely from abroad, and no one dared to disassemble or replace it. Later, when foreign goods could no longer be imported, they had to find a way to make it themselves. This was the job of the bench work team. A commutator had 165 copper pieces, which had to be made by hand, piece by piece. Bench workers Liu Mengxing and Fang Wenlong took the lead, voluntarily forgoing piecework and overtime pay (in the past, extra work or overtime was paid extra). They worked from morning to night, without stopping for a minute. This spirit of work moved the whole team, and they all worked hard together, encouraging each other. Not only did they complete the planned six commutators ahead of schedule, but they also made three more. The bench work team's odds and ends were not delayed either. Encouraged by everyone, Liu and Fang left early and returned late, making two commutators a week (in the past, going slow, twenty people would only make one a week). Other teams were also moved, forgoing piecework and overtime pay, and working together. The welding team of three workers had to make forty large gear wheels in addition to their daily work. In the past, this work would take a year. Team leader Wang Naiquan united two people, and the three divided the work and competed with each other. Making a large gear wheel was not a simple task. Eighty-three teeth had to be welded together one by one (the teeth of the gear wheel were worn flat, and new ones should have been replaced, but new goods could not be imported, so they had to use electric welding to repair the worn teeth). In the past, it took three days to make one, but now it only takes one and a half days. The electric cylinders of nineteen damaged cars had to be re-assembled with parts. This was originally the job of the car assembly team, but the car assembly team often had to maintain eighty cars on the road and was too busy. White Zhizhao, the team leader of the small electrician team, voluntarily took over this job and took the lead in doing it, taking out the parts he had saved privately for more than ten years. The electric cylinders of nineteen cars were completed in two weeks (in the past, going slow, lacking parts, they would rest, and four people would make one a week). The small electrician team was also responsible for items such as flame rings, small hearts, and resistors, which were not delayed. The large electrician team had to make thirty-eight roller cores to be used. According to past records, only two could be produced in a week. How could they meet the "May 1st" deadline? Unexpectedly, from March 17th to April 17th, in one month, not only did they exceed the plan and complete forty-nine, but they also made 184 motor coils, 615 new winding wires, 165 old winding wires, and refurbished six electric commutator rollers. The electrical work was entirely manual, and the achievements today are unprecedented.
    When the hundred-trolleybus campaign was first launched, no one in the electrician team dared to respond, and no one believed it. Today, it has been completed one hundred and twenty percent ahead of schedule. Electrician Peng Zhenshui explained the reason: "All the workers in the team worked together, huddled together, extended the time when everyone extended the time. If the work could not be completed within the working hours, the five o'clock quitting time was extended to seven o'clock. If it still could not be completed, they would come earlier the next day, and eat corn bread while working at noon. Everything was for work, and they did it voluntarily and together. In this way, the workers' labor overcame the material difficulties and the urgency of time, and the number of good cars increased day by day, and the plan was completed ahead of schedule on April 19." Hu Quanggui, one of the workers who launched the hundred-trolleybus campaign, said: "The Communist Party is the party of the workers. After liberation, we workers are truly the masters. Comrades Peng Zhen, Xiao Ming, and Xu Bing all took the initiative to talk to us. In the past (referring to before liberation), when have we workers ever seen the door of the bureau chief or the mayor! The exchange of gold yuan certificates gave priority to our workers. Workers were given treatment when they were injured. Who cared about that in the past! We workers are in charge, of course we have to work hard for ourselves, so every shift can exceed the plan."

    百辆电车是怎样完成的？
    冯仲
    北平电车工人提前完成了“五一出车百辆运动”后，不幸在廿五日被国民党特务的一把火烧掉了五十八辆，焚毁了工人辛勤劳动造成的迎接“五一”的礼物。但工人的劳动创造力是任何阴谋也毁灭不了的，特务企图用烧毁电车打击工人生产情绪，结果却得其反，新社会主人翁的工人们把愤怒变成了力量，用实际行动回击特务分子的破坏，为了建设繁荣的新北平，正在准备再来一个一百辆车运动。
    今天，一百辆电车虽然是出不来了，但电车修造厂工人提前十一天完成了“出车百辆”计划，及在生产运动过程中表现的积极性和许多奇迹是不可抹煞的。
    电车公司民国十三年成立时，只有六十部机车，三十部拖车，一部车的寿命是十五年，到现在每一辆车都已逾龄十年了。当日寇侵入，八年沦陷的北平电车，更变得五痨七伤，由九十几辆曾降到八辆。国民党统治时期，平均一天也只出车四、五十辆，但因为那些特殊人物的横行：一辆车有时只能卖到十几张票，电车工人经常被打、挨骂、吃不饱、穿不暖，谁有心肠去修车！大家都希望这恶环境早早结束，所以，当一月三十一日解放军入城，首先在西直门欢迎的是电车工人，首先（二月一日）恢复的也是电车。那时一天也只出四十几辆车。过去受压迫最深的工人，觉悟也最快，解放不久电车工人知道了自己作了主人，认清了只有发展生产，工人生活才能改善。而且现在又按实物发薪，生活有了保障，可以安心工作了。经一个月的努力，到三月底出车数就增到七十八辆，能修的车都修好了。
    三月中旬，电车修造厂的工人自动发起了“五一”出车百辆运动。最初全厂工人代表开会，许多人认为是不可能的事，厂子既老且破，摆在眼前的废车，有的只剩下一个空架子，七零八落的材料那里能补充的上？何况跑着的车子经常损坏，还要随时修理！但解放后工人们生产的热情是任何困难都挡不住的，当行政上答应供给材料之后，工人们一个个活跃起来，磨拳擦掌，准备来干这一件认为不可能完成的工作。首先工人代表和厂长、工程师一起开会订生产计划，而又完全采纳了工人的意见，这是以前没有过的事。
    这次生产运动中，一反过去磨洋工的作法，工人们充分发扬了互助团结精神，创造了许多奇迹，没有一班不提前完成或超过预定计划的。
    计划中的铜头（整流子）要用六个，这玩艺以前完全由外洋买来，谁也不敢拆换，以后外国来不了货，只有自己设法做，这是案工班的活，一个铜头一百六十五片铜片，要一片片用手做出来。案工刘梦星、方文龙两个人首起带头作用，自动地不要包活和加点费（过去多做一件活或加钟点都另给钱），由早干到晚，一分钟也不停休，这种工作精神感动了全班，也都卖起劲来，团结在一起，互相鼓励，不但提前完成预定的六个铜头，又多做出了三个。案工上的零活也没有耽误，刘、方两个工人受大家鼓励，早去晚走，一星期就做了两个铜头（以前磨洋工，二十个人一星期只做一个）。其他各班也受感动，不要包活加点钱，一齐干下去，电焊班三个工人除去日活，还要做四十个大牙轮。这点工作在过去要吃一年。领班工人王乃全团结了两个人，三个人把工作分开竞赛，做大牙轮不是简单的事，八十三个牙齿，要一个个焊补起来（牙轮齿磨平了，本应换新的，新货来不了，只好用电焊把磨平的齿补起来），以前三天做一个，现在只要一天半。有十九辆坏车的电缸，都要重新按装零件，这本是架车班的事，但架车班经常要维持八十辆车在路上跑，忙不过来，小电工班领班白志钊自动把这件活要过来，带头去做，把过去十几年私人存的零件都拿了出来，十九辆车的电缸，两个星期就完成了（从前磨洋工、缺少零件就休息，四个人一星期做一个）。小电工班应负责的吹火圈、小心子、电阻等零件也没有耽误。大电工班要作出三十八个滚子心才能够用，照过去纪录一星期只能出两个，如何赶得上“五一”用？想不到三月十七到四月十七的一个月内，不仅超过计划，完成了四十九个，又做出马达圈一八四个，新把线六一五根，旧把线一六五根，装修滚子心铜头六个电。电工完全是手工，得到今天的成绩是有史以来没有过的事。
    在刚发起百辆车运动时候，电工班没有一个人敢应，谁也不相信。到今天会提前完成了百分之一百二十。电工彭振绥说出了这个原因：“全班工人一齐努力，抱在一团做，延长时间时全体延长，工作时间内不能完成的，把五点下班的时间延长到七点。假如还不能完成，第二天再早来，中午一边吃着窝头一边干活，一切为了工作，自动团结去做。就这样，工人的劳动力克服了材料困难和时间的仓促，好车一天天增多，到四月十九日就提前完成了计划”。发起百辆车运动工人之一的胡泉桂说：“共产党是工人的党，解放后我们工人真的作主人了。彭真同志、萧明同志、徐冰同志都自动找我们谈话，以前（指解放前）我们工人那见过局长、市长的门口！兑换金圆券首先优待我们工人，工人受伤给治疗，过去谁管哪！我们工人当家了，当然要好好的给自己干活，所以每班都能超过计划。”
