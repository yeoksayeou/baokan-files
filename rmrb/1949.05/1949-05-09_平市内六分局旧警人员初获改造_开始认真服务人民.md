Beiping Dispatch: The handling of former police officers in the Sixth Precinct of Beiping has largely concluded, achieving considerable success. They have begun to adjust their organization, improve systems, and promote organizational strength for strict management. In terms of handling, they have done the following: First, they universally convened police officer meetings, announced the principles of handling, and organized discussions by section. The handling principles were mainly based on work performance and character. Those with poor work style, bad character, those who were passive and negligent, frequently absent, and who did not change after education, were eliminated, even if they were young and strong. Ding Yishi and others are examples of this. Traffic police officer Bai Shizhong, guard Hu Weiqi, and detention center officer Ke Guangwu, although older, were loyal to their duties and content to serve, so they were retained. Second, organizational adjustments were made, and the duty system was changed. This personnel handling was uneven: some sections eliminated more people, and some eliminated fewer. After the reduction in personnel, the duty could not be carried out according to the original system, and personnel had to be adjusted. The method was based on the police station, which was equipped independently. The original ten-person, four-eight rotation system (each section had twelve people: one inspector, one sergeant, and ten officers) was changed to a seven-person, three-shift system (each section had eight people). Everyone believed that this not only did not reduce work efficiency but also increased it. The elimination of negative elements also increased the sense of responsibility of each police officer. Third, universal work summaries were conducted. The sub-bureau stipulated specific summary content, and the self-reporting and public discussion method was adopted by section. This was an improvement for everyone: those who had achievements were very happy, and those who had no achievements were also educated. Fourth, work cycle books were established from the section to the police station to understand the situation below and facilitate guidance. Learning committees were established in the police stations, insisting on two hours of study every day, and the study promoted the work. After this period of work, some police officers have made significant changes in their work style. Zhao Kelin, a police officer from the Sixteenth Section, refused bribes and solved two cases of drug trafficking. The Fourteenth Section solved the robbery case of Chu Weizhou and recovered all the belongings of the victim Zhang Wen. Zhang Wen prepared a banquet to thank them but was declined; Zhang bought things to send to the section, but that was also declined. Police sergeants and officers from the Sixth Section personally went to each alley and household to clear garbage. Wang Bingmin, a police officer from the Seventh Section, met Zhang Guangliang, an unemployed worker from Fangshan County, while patrolling at night. Zhang wanted to return to his hometown, but he had no travel expenses and was sick and unable to walk. Wang used 30 people's currency to hire a pedicab driver to take him to the district government. Similar facts have appeared a lot recently. Ma Jiarong, a police officer from the Fourteenth Section, was very serious when checking household registrations. Many police officers in each section did not rest on their days off and continued to work to reorganize household registrations and clear garbage. Many police officers are looking for books to read and buying books. Hou Haiquan, from the sub-bureau's duty section, who originally could not read, can now recognize sixty or seventy characters and can write himself. However, there are still some biases that need to be overcome urgently. For example, some people are still not content with their work, especially those above the rank of inspector, who complain about low salaries, and some ask to quit. Some are not used to disciplined life and are unwilling to learn. Generally, there is still a strong concept of being hired in their work, and the initiative in work is still very poor. In the future, we must continue to work hard to correct these biases.

    平市内六分局旧警人员初获改造
    开始认真服务人民
    【平市讯】平市内六分局对旧警人员处理已大体结束，获得相当成绩，开始走上了调整组织，健全制度，推动组织力量进行严格管理。在处理方面，他们曾做了以下几个工作。一、普遍召开员警会议，宣布处理原则，组织了以段为单位讨论。处理原则，主要是按工作，按品行，作风不好的、品行恶劣的、消极怠工、经常旷勤、经教育不改的，虽然年轻力壮，亦在淘汰之列。如丁益时等即是一例。交通警白世忠、守卫警胡维启、拘留所柯广武，年纪虽大，但忠于职守，安心服务，因此仍被留用。二、进行组织调整，改变了勤务制度。这次人事处理，是不均匀的：有的段淘汰较多，有的段淘汰较少。人员减少后，勤务即不能按原有制度执行，人员必须进行调整。办法是以分所为主，自行配备，将原来十人，四八互换制（每段十二人，巡官一人，警长一人，警士十人）改为七人三布制（每段八人），大家认为这样不但不减少工作效率，反而增加工作效率。消极分子被斥革了，也加重了每个警士的责任心。三、普遍的进行了工作总结。由分局规定具体总结内容，以段为单位，采取自报公议办法进行。这样对大家是个提高：有成绩的很高兴，没有成绩的也受到教育。四、从段到分所建立工作循环簿，达到了解下情，便利指导工作。以分所为单位成立学委会，坚持每天两小时的学习，学习中推动了工作。经过这段工作，部份警察作风上有了显著的转变。十六段警士赵克麟拒绝贿赂，破获贩卖毒品案两起。十四段破获褚维周抢劫案，将事主张文东西全部找回。张文准备酒席来酬劳被谢绝；张买东西给段上送，又被谢绝。六段警长警士则亲自动手到各巷各户清除垃圾，七段警士王秉敏晚上巡查，遇见房山县一失业工人张广亮欲回原籍，苦无路费，身体有病，不能走路，王便以人民券三十元代雇一三轮车夫送往区政府。类似以上这样的事实，最近出现还很多。十四段警士马家荣查户口时很认真。各段在重新整理户口，清除垃圾中，有不少警察休息日不休息，仍继续工作。有不少警士到处找书看，买书读。分局勤务侯海泉原来不识字，现已识到六七十个了，并自己会写。但现在仍有一些偏向存在着，急须克服。如部份人还不安心工作，特别是巡官以上的，嫌薪金少，个别的要求不干。有的对纪律生活过不惯，不愿意学习。一般的是在工作上还存在着浓厚的雇佣观念，工作上的主动性还是很差的。今后尚须针对这些偏向继续努力矫正。
