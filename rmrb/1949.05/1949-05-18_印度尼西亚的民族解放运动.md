The National Liberation Movement in Indonesia
By Ge Luote, General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, Translated by Wang Feijie

After Japan's surrender, Sukarno and Hatta, who had served the Japanese aggressors, declared the independence of the republic under the pressure of the people (August 17, 1945 - translator's note). In reality, all they did was change the "National Committee," headed by bourgeois elements, into a government, while using every method to prevent the development of the national liberation movement. Feudal rule remained as before, and the peasants continued to be exploited. Most of the old rulers who had served the Dutch and Japanese colonial regimes still ruled the countryside. In the Sjahrir and Sjarifuddin cabinets, the Socialist Party had occupied decisively important positions, but they also took no measures to alleviate the burdens of the workers and peasants. Land reform was out of the question.

The democratic movement in Indonesia developed under the leadership of the Communist Party. Only the Communist Party had actively fought against Japan during the war.

The Indonesian Communist Party was founded in May 1920, but was soon banned and brutally suppressed by the Dutch colonial authorities. After the uprising in 1927, thousands of party members were massacred and imprisoned in the infamous Obo-Digul concentration camp in New Guinea. Only a few party leaders were able to escape overseas, including Musso, a member of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Party and leader of the Postal Workers' Union.

In 1936, Comrade Musso re-united the scattered forces of the Indonesian Communist Party and established a communist group. This core operating underground later became the new Indonesian Communist Party. By the time of World War II, it had been able to influence the broad masses of the people through legal and semi-legal nationalist parties and trade unions.

After Japan's surrender, a united front including all classes was declared, and the Communist Party was therefore able to work legally. However, the weakness of the Indonesian Communist Party's activities during this period was that they did not appear as an open political party. They continued their past tactics, maintained underground organizations, and dispersed their forces. They even formed a Socialist Party and allowed the right wing of the Socialist Party, including Bevin's agent Sjahrir, to play a leading role in it. Indonesian communists were very active in the "Workers' Party" and purged the Japanese spies within it.

Although the Communist Party had some weaknesses, it continued to receive increasing support from the broad masses of the people. Last summer and autumn, the party corrected its mistakes based on the correct practical application of the Lenin-Stalin doctrine on national and colonial questions. After that, the party achieved significant victories. Many workers' parties merged with the Communist Party. The party established its foundation on trade unions, peasant organizations, and militant socialist youth league organizations.

The Indonesian Communist Party's decision to expand its mass base and openly acknowledge past mistakes led to a new upsurge in the national liberation movement and was strongly supported by the working people. The Communist Party's program called for the liberation of the country from all imperialist armies and influences, and called on the people to form a broad national front. The party put forward many democratic demands to the Hatta government. It demanded the immediate democratization of the state power apparatus and the handing over of the confiscated lands of imperialist landlords to rural communities (this was crucial because Java's irrigation system required collective farming). The Communist Party firmly insisted that Hatta should stop surrendering to American and Dutch imperialism. The party determined the goal of overthrowing the Hatta government, which relied entirely on the bourgeoisie and landlords, and determined to replace the Hatta government with a people's government that could lead the people to victory.

The strengthening of the Communist Party's activities and its determination to lead the national liberation struggle unfolded new revolutionary prospects before the people. The expansion of the Communist Party's influence aroused the frenzied activities of the Washington, London, and The Hague giants. Imperialism adopted its usual weapons - terror and massacre - and finally adopted the Trotskyist provocation.

The influence of American financial circles on the Hatta government increased day by day. As is well known, many rubber plantations and other enterprises in Indonesia have fallen into the hands of Americans. More than 50 percent of the investment in the Jambi oil industry in central Sumatra is controlled by Americans. On July 2, 1948, the Hatta government signed an agreement with the American banker Fox, which stipulated that all of Indonesia's foreign trade would be leased for 15 years. Fox also obtained many important economic concessions. Unofficial British and American military and economic advisers stationed in the Hatta government appeared on the streets of Yogyakarta.

The American representative on the Security Council's "Mediation Committee" to Indonesia used their position to act as political advisors to the Hatta government and instructors of the US State Department.

Last July, a secret meeting was held at the Sarangan Villa in Java. Participants included Aubrey, the American representative of the "Mediation Committee." At this meeting, Aubrey insisted that Hatta should put down communism in the Republic and promised to provide Hatta with American weapons and instructors from "special forces."

In September 1948, Hatta carried out the task assigned to him by the Americans. After claiming that the "Communists" had launched a "revolution" in Madiun, Central Java, the Hatta government launched an anti-communist terror campaign throughout the Republic. More than 25,000 patriots were arrested and many party leaders were killed.

This imperialist conspiracy was carefully planned in imitation of Hitler's methods. They began by trying to instigate the Hatta group to attack the communists, hoping that this attack would nip the revolution in the bud. What followed was an attack on the Republic itself, in order to bring about a swift military defeat of the national liberation movement. When Dutch paratroopers landed in Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic, on September 18, they met no serious resistance. The Hatta government surrendered "according to plan." However, subsequent developments have not yet satisfied the Dutch imperialists.

While officers of part of the Republic's regular army surrendered, the people's armed forces and the so-called Lascars (Hatta government mercenaries - translator's note) refused to lay down their arms. They retreated into the mountains to continue fighting. The Dutch army and its extended lines of communication were constantly attacked by these guerrillas.

Relying on their temporary military advantage, the Dutch imperialists are restoring their old colonial rule throughout the Republic. Hatta, Sukarno and their supporters, who had hoped that their betrayal would be rewarded with continued power, have become victims of deception. After arresting them, the Dutch authorities immediately abolished the Republic. The Netherlands is relying on its army and police to maintain its rule. Their promises of a so-called Indonesian government are merely a fig leaf to conceal their colonial plunder.

The Security Council's recent discussion of the Indonesian issue reveals that the United States is the creator of the "Indonesian tragedy." The Indonesian people are paying a heavy price for the reactionary feudal bourgeoisie's division of the national liberation movement. However, the Indonesian people have not been defeated. They are uniting around the Communist Party and continuing the struggle for freedom and independence.

The new stage of the Indonesian colonial war has exacerbated the contradictions within the Netherlands. The Dutch bourgeoisie's rampant violation of the sovereignty of the Indonesian people has aroused fierce protests from all strata of the Dutch people. Many factories have seen strikes, and many cities have held demonstrations. The Dutch Communist Party is fighting against colonial terror in order to strengthen the common struggle of the Dutch working people and the Indonesian people.

### 印度尼西亚的民族解放运动

　　印度尼西亚的民族解放运动
    荷共总书记  格罗特作  王飞节译
    日本投降以后，曾为日本侵略者服务的苏加诺与哈达，在人民的压力下，宣布了共和国的独立（一九四五年八月十七日——译者）。实际上，他们所做的仅是把以资产阶级分子为首的“民族委员会”改换为政府，同时则以一切方法来阻止民族解放运动的发展。封建统治照旧存在，农民继续遭受剥削。曾经给荷兰与日本殖民政权服务的大部分旧的统治者，仍然统治着乡村。在沙利尔与沙利佛丁内阁中，社会党曾经占据有决定性的重要职位，但他们也未采取任何办法来减轻工农的负担。土地改革更不用提了。
    印尼的民主运动是在共产党领导下发展起来的。只有共产党曾在战时对日本积极作战。
    印尼共产党成立于一九二○年五月，但不久即遭到荷兰殖民地当局的禁止与野蛮的镇压。在一九二七年起义之后，成千的党员被屠杀，被关到新几内亚著名残酷的奥布——第格集中营里去。只有少数党的领袖得以逃到海外，印尼党的中央委员兼邮政工人工会领袖穆索，即是其中的一个。
    一九三六年，穆索同志重新联合印尼共产党被打散了的力量，建立了一个共产主义小组。这个在地下活动的核心，后来变成了印尼新的共产党。到了二次大战的时候，它已经能够经过合法与半合法的民族主义政党及职工会，影响着广大的人民。
    日本投降后，一个包括一切阶层的联合阵线宣告成立，共产党因此又能合法地工作。但是，印尼共产党在这一时期活动的弱点是：他们没有以公开的政党出现。他们继续过去的策略，保持地下的组织，分散他们的力量。他们甚至成立一个社会党，并且让社会党右翼，包括贝文的代理人沙利尔在内，在里面起领导作用。印尼共产党人在“工人党”中很活动，并清洗了其中的日本奸细。
    共产党虽然有些弱点，它仍然日益受到广大人民的支持。去年夏天和秋天，党在正确地实际运用列宁——斯大林关于民族与殖民地问题学说的基础上，改正了它的错误。在这之后，党获得了重大的胜利。许多工人政党与共产党合并了。党将它的基础建立在职工会、农民组织及富于战斗精神的社会主义青年团组织之上。
    印尼共产党之决定扩大其群众基础并公开承认过去的错误，引起了民族解放运动的新高涨，并受到劳动人民的坚强支持。共产党的政纲要求从一切帝国主义的军队和影响下解放国家，号召人民成立一个广泛的民族阵线。党向哈达政府提出了许多民主的要求，它要求国家政权机构的立即民主化，将没收的帝国主义地主的土地交给农村社团（这是至关紧要的，因为爪哇的水利灌溉制度需要共同耕作）。共产党坚决主张哈达应停止对美荷帝国主义的投降。党确定了推翻完全依靠资产阶级与大地主的哈达政府的目标，确定以一个能领导人民走向胜利的人民政府来代替哈达政府。
    共产党活动的加强及其决心领导民族解放斗争，在人民面前展开了新的革命前景。共产党影响的扩大引起了华盛顿、伦敦与海牙巨头们的狂热活动。帝国主义采用了它们惯用的武器——恐怖和屠杀，并在最后采取了托洛茨基的挑衅。
    美国金融界对哈达政府的影响，日益加大。如所周知，印尼许多橡树园及其他企业，已落到美国人手里。苏门答腊中部的占碑石油工业中的投资，百分之五十以上都操在美国人的手里。一九四八年七月二日，哈达政府与美国银行家福克斯签订了一个协定，其中规定印尼的全部对外贸易租让十五年。福克斯还获得了许多重要的经济租借权。非正式派驻哈达政府的英美军事、经济顾问们，在日惹的街头出现了。
    安理会派到印尼去的“调处委员会”中的美国代表，利用他们的地位，执行着哈达政府政治顾问与美国国务院指导官的角色。
    去年七月，一次秘密会议曾在爪哇的萨兰冈山庄中举行。参加会议的有“调处委员会”的美国代表奥布伦。奥布伦在这个会上坚主哈达应当扑灭共和国中的共产主义，并答应以美国武器和“特种部队”的教官，供给哈达使用。
    一九四八年九月，哈达执行了美国人交给他的任务。哈达政府在扬言“共产党”已在中爪哇的茉莉芬发动“革命”后，在共和国全境开始了反共的恐怖运动。二万五千余爱国者被逮捕，许多党的领袖被杀害。
    这个帝国主义阴谋是仿照希特勒的方法精心策划的，他们开始竭力怂恿哈达集团去打击共产党人，希望这一打击使革命夭折。他们继之而来的就是打击共和国本身，以便使民族解放运动在军事上迅速失败。当荷兰伞兵于九月十八日在共和国首都日惹降落时，它没有遇到任何严重的抵抗。哈达政府“按照计划”投降了。然而，以后的发展却还未能使荷兰帝国主义者满意。
    当部分的共和国正规军的军官投降时，人民的武装以及所谓拉斯卡（哈达政府雇佣军——译者）部队却拒绝放下武器。他们退到山中继续战斗。荷军及其延长了的交通线，受到这些游击队的不断攻击。
    荷兰帝国主义者依恃其暂时的军事优势，正在共和国全境恢复其旧的殖民地统治。哈达、苏加诺及其支持者，曾希望他们的叛卖将获得继续当权的报偿，可是他们已变成一种骗局的牺牲品。荷兰当局在把他们逮捕起来之后，立即取消了共和国。荷兰正依靠它的军队与警察来维持其统治。他们关于所谓印尼政府的诺言，只是用来维饰其殖民地掠夺的遮羞布而已。
    安理会最近关于印尼问题的讨论，暴露出美国是“印尼悲剧”的制造者。印尼人民正因反动的封建资产阶级的分裂民族解放运动而付出重大的代价。然而印尼人民并未被打败。他们正团结在共产党的周围，继续争取自由与独立的斗争。
    印尼殖民战争的新阶段，使荷兰国内的矛盾更为严重。荷兰资产阶级之猖獗地破坏印尼人民的主权，引起了荷兰各阶层人民的猛烈抗议。许多工厂发生了罢工，许多城市举行了示威。荷兰共产党正在为反对殖民地恐怖而进行斗争，以便加强荷兰劳动人民与印尼人民的共同斗争。（原文载今年二月十五日的“争取持久和平与人民民主”）
