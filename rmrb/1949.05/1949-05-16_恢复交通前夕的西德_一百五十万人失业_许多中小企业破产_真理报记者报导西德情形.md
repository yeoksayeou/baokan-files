Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15th: TASS, Moscow, May 13th: A special "Pravda" correspondent in Berlin reports on the situation in the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany on the eve of the Soviet occupation authorities' lifting of restrictions on transportation, transit, and trade to Berlin and between the Soviet and Western zones.

The "Pravda" reporter visited several larger cities in the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany and saw fishermen in Hamburg forced to throw fish back into the sea because they could not sell them, while the people had no money to buy fish. Potatoes were rotting in cellars because they could not be sold, while workers' wives were eating potato peels as their main meal. The economic chaos caused by severing economic ties with eastern Germany has led to disastrous levels of unemployment. The number of unemployed in the western occupation zones of Germany has reached 1.5 million. Many small and medium-sized enterprises and companies have declared bankruptcy, with bankruptcy cases increasing sevenfold in the last three months compared to last year. The US and British policy of dismembering Germany has driven the economy of the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany to a dead end. Even British Military Governor Robertson was forced to admit at a recent press conference that unemployment continues to rise and that superficial optimism is inappropriate.

On May 12th (the date strictly stipulated by the Four-Power Agreement), the Soviet occupation authorities lifted restrictions on transportation, transit, and trade to Berlin and between the Soviet and West German occupation zones. The Marienborn checkpoint opened at one minute past midnight, and the first British jeep crossed the demarcation line. At 1:50 AM, the first military passenger train passed through the Marienborn train station en route to Berlin. Trains and automobiles were allowed to pass smoothly in an organized manner without incident. Within the city of Berlin, both sides removed guard posts on the demarcation lines of each occupation zone after midnight. From May 12th onwards, all traffic within greater Berlin was no longer subject to any restrictions at the demarcation lines. Residents of the Western occupation zones of Berlin eagerly bought newspapers from the Soviet zone.

The "Pravda" reporter pointed out that the Western powers' sudden and hasty ratification of the "Bonn Constitution" greatly surprised the German residents. For a long time, the drafters of the "Constitution" had not reached agreement on many clauses. Now, on the eve of the Paris Conference, for some reason, all disagreements were "eliminated," and the draft was hurriedly read and passed without discussion. It is believed here that this hasty action, which is strange to say the least, is an attempt by certain groups to present the Foreign Ministers' Conference with a fait accompli of the political dismemberment of Germany. A democratic newspaper in Berlin pointed out: "This Bonn solution is an obstacle to the Paris talks."

　　恢复交通前夕的西德
  　一百五十万人失业
  　许多中小企业破产
    真理报记者报导西德情形
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报特派记者自柏林来讯，叙述西德联占区在苏联占领当局取消对柏林以及对苏占区与西占区之间交通、运输及贸易限制前夕的情形。
    真理报记者走访西德联占区一些较大的城市，看到汉堡的渔人们因为鱼卖不出去被迫又丢回海中；而人民却没有钱买鱼。马铃薯没有销路，在地窑里腐烂，而工人的妻子们则以马铃薯皮当正餐。由于切断与东部德国的经济关系而造成的经济混乱，使失业达到灾难性的规模，德国西占区的失业人数已达一百五十万。许多中小企业及公司已宣告破产，破产案件在最近三个月内较去年增加七倍。美英肢解德国的政策，使西德联占区的经济走入绝境。甚至英国的军事总督罗伯逊在最近的记者招待会上也被迫承认，失业继续增长，表面的乐观是不得当的。
    五月十二日（四国协定所严格确定的日期）苏联占领当局取消了对柏林以及苏占区与西德占领区之间交通、运输及贸易的限制，马林邦的检查站于午夜零时一分开放通路，第一辆英国吉普车越过分界线。一时五十分，第一列军用客车通过马林帮的火车站开往柏林，火车汽车都在有组织的情形下许其顺利通过，未发生任何事件。在柏林市内，双方在午夜以后撤除了各占领区分界线上的警岗，自五月十二日起，大柏林市内一切交通在分界线上不再受任何管制。柏林西占区的居民，热切地购买苏占区的报纸。
    真理报记者指出，西方国家突然匆忙地批准“波恩宪法”使德国居民大为惊奇。许久以来“宪法”的制作人在不少条款上未获协议。现在，在巴黎会议的前夕，由于某种原因，一切分歧均告“消除”，草案匆匆宣读通过，没有讨论。此间认为，这一至少可以说是奇怪的匆促行动，乃是某些集团想以政治上肢解德国的既成事实摆在外长会议之前。柏林民主报纸指出：“波恩的这种解决办法，是巴黎谈判的障碍”。
