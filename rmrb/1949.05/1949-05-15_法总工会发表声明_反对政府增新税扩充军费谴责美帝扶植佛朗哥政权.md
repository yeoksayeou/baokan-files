Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, Paris: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement after its meeting on May 11th: "The Executive Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor condemns the policy of preparing for a new war and its consequences, namely, increasing military spending, increasing new taxes at the expense of the interests of working people, new offensives against social security and family allowances, and refusing to increase wages, etc. Under these circumstances, working people must not only unite to fight for their legitimate demands and defend social laws, but also fight better for peace and freedom, and for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Peace Congress. The Executive Bureau has learned of the United Nations' discussion on the issue of Franco's Spain. The Executive Bureau condemns the support of several reactionary governments for Franco, especially the United States' financial assistance to the Spanish dictator, and has decided to lodge a protest with the government and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, reaffirming the unwavering stance of the French working class in opposing the Franco regime and sympathizing with the Spanish people. The Executive Bureau protests against the French government's persecution of people's representatives and journalists. In the context of the development of the Marshall Plan, the Executive Bureau reiterates that working people must defend their representatives and their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of will."
