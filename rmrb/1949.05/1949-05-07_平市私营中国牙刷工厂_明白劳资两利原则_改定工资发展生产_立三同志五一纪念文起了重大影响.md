    Ping City Private China Toothbrush Factory
    Understands the Principle of Labor-Capital Benefit, Revises Wages, and Develops Production
    Comrade Li Lisan's May Day Commemorative Article Has a Significant Impact
    [Our Newspaper] Ping City Private China Toothbrush Factory, based on its business situation in April, labor and management negotiated and adjusted wages for the third time, and revised the unreasonable parts of the labor-management contract drafted in April. This factory has been in existence for more than ten years, and is the only machine-made toothbrush industry in Pingjin (Beiping/Tianjin) area. There are a total of forty-two workers in the factory (including twenty-two female workers), and three factory managers. Before liberation, due to the impact of the devaluation of the Gold Yuan, workers' wages were extremely low. The wages earned by male workers were sometimes only enough for a haircut or a pair of shoes, in addition to maintaining their own lives. Workers' production morale was not normal, and the factory could not stop the waste of raw materials. After the People's Liberation Army besieged the city, production was also affected by power outages and fell into a state of semi-shutdown. Some workers remained in the factory, and the factory still provided food and accommodation. As a result, there was a large deficit in February. After the resumption of work in late February, the workers of the factory immediately demanded an adjustment of wages. On March 1, the local work team conducted preliminary consultations with the factory and eight workers. At that time, the capitalist was skeptical of the principle of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital" that we proposed, had no confidence in product sales, and reluctantly accepted the workers' request to calculate wages in kind. The initial consultation resulted in male workers receiving a maximum of 150 jin of rice in addition to food and accommodation provided by the factory, and female workers were paid by piece (i.e., one yuan and five jiao of People's currency per toothbrush). Due to the initial adjustment of wages, coupled with the influence of the education that workers received on labor-capital benefit and production development, workers' production morale in March was higher than before. Not only did they pay attention to cherishing raw materials, but also in terms of output, they increased by 67 dozen compared to October of last year, and nearly doubled compared to before the siege (January). At the end of the month, the accountant determined that the capitalist could obtain a net profit of 134,300 yuan, which was enough to make up for the deficit in February, with a surplus. In order to further adjust labor-management relations, the work team, together with worker representatives, discussed with the factory for more than ten days and drafted a labor-management contract, which stipulated: (1) Male workers' wages, in addition to food and accommodation, a maximum monthly wage of 300 jin and a minimum of 180 jin of millet; female workers were still paid by piece (regardless of food and accommodation), averaging 15 jin of millet per 100 brushes (40 brushes could be made per day); (2) There were four methods for handling profits: First, 20 percent would be used as funds for expanding production; second, 20 percent would be used for repairing machines or repairing houses; third, 20 percent would be used as worker welfare funds; fourth, in addition to the above-mentioned 60 percent, the remaining 40 percent would be divided equally between labor and management; (3) The factory accounts would be made public, and worker representatives would be sent to review the accounts. (4) Working hours were changed from ten hours to eight hours (because the grinding work was extremely unsanitary, and excessively long working hours affected workers' health). This contract was based on the profits in March and the previous business conditions (the capitalist could earn a surplus of 30 percent in addition to paying wages and costs), generally guaranteeing the workers' lives. The capitalist also saw the labor effects of raising wages and did not raise more objections, and voluntarily drew welfare funds to purchase books and newspapers and buy masks for workers according to the workers' requirements. At the end of April, an inspection of the implementation of the contract revealed that from the perspective of production efficiency, although working hours were shortened, it did not affect the production rate, and it produced three dozen more than in March. However, due to the failure to find a good solution to product sales, and the fact that grain prices rose faster in April, while toothbrush prices rose slower, the accountant determined that the capitalist needed to experience a deficit of around 200,000 yuan. On May 1, when reporters visited the factory, both labor and management were brewing a re-evaluation of wages. The factory manager told reporters that he had just read the full text of Li Lisan's report published in the newspaper. He read it three times in a row, and felt completely enlightened in his heart. Although there was a deficit last month, based on this spirit, he was confident in developing production. On May 2, the work team, together with labor and management, formally studied the issue of revising wages. Because the factory accounts were made public in April, the factory's deficit situation was understood by the workers. Comrade Li Lisan's report played an even greater role among the workers, and they voluntarily proposed to lower wages to promote production development. The 20 percent of the surplus that the workers took as welfare funds, as stipulated in the labor-management contract, was revised to 10 percent, and the funds for expanding reproduction were expanded to 30 percent. Both labor and management expressed satisfaction with this agreement. The factory manager also told the workers that if there was a surplus in the May business results, wages could be adjusted again. The factory's May production will be consolidated and steadily advanced on this basis. (Kang Weizhong)

    平市私营中国牙刷工厂
    明白劳资两利原则  改定工资发展生产 
    立三同志五一纪念文起了重大影响
    【本报讯】平市私营中国牙刷工厂，依据四月份经营情况，劳资双方协商，第三次调整工资，并修改四月份所拟之劳资契约中不合理的部分。该厂创建至今已有十余年之历史，为平津两市仅有之机器牙刷业，厂内共有工人四十二人（内有女工二十二人），厂方经理人员为三人，在解放前，因受金圆券贬值影响，工人工资极低，男工除维持本人生活外，工资所得有时只够理一次发或买一双鞋，工人生产情绪不正常，浪费原料的情况厂方无法制止。解放军围城后，又因停电影响，生产陷于半停工状态，厂内留住部分工人，仍由厂方供给膳宿，因之，二月份亏空较大，二月下旬复工后，该厂工人即提出调整工资要求。三月一日，当地工作组即与厂方及工人八人，进行初步协商，当时资方对我所提之“发展生产、劳资两利”原则持怀疑态度，对产品销路无信心，对于工人所提出以实物计工资之要求，勉强接受，初步协商结果，确定男工除由厂方供给膳宿外，最高一百五十斤米，女工按件计资（即按一只牙刷合人民券一元五角）。由于初步调整工资结果，加以工人接受了劳资两利，发展生产的教育的影响，三月份内，工人生产情绪，较前提高。不仅注意爱惜原料，而且在产量方面，比去年十月时增加六十七打，比围城前（一月份）则增加近一倍。月底算帐结果，资方可得纯利十三万四千三百元，除弥补二月份亏空外尚有余。为进一步调整劳资关系，工作组协同工人代表与厂方经过十余日的讨论，试订劳资契约一纸，契约中规定：（一）男工工资除食宿外，每月最高工资三百斤、最低一百八十斤小米；女工仍是按件计资（不管食宿），每一百只刷子平均合十五斤小米（每天可作四十只刷子）；（二）盈余处理办法有四：一，百分之二十作扩大生产之资金；二，百分之二十作为修理机器或修缮房舍之用；三，百分之二十作为工人福利金；四，除以上所用之百分之六十外，下余百分之四十，由劳资双方平分；（三）厂方帐目公开，工人派代表审查帐目。（四）劳动时间由十小时改为八小时（因磨板工作极不卫生，过长劳动时间影响工人健康）。此项契约，系依据三月份盈利及以往的经营状况（资方除付工资及成本外，可盈余百分之三十。）规定，一般的保证了工人生活。资方亦因确实看到工资提高后的一些劳动效果，未提出更多的意见，并主动依据工人要求，抽出福利金为工人添置书报，买口罩。四月底检查该契约施行结果，从生产效能上讲，虽缩短工时，但并未影响生产率，且比三月份多产三打。但由于产品销路未求得很好解决，且因四月份内粮价上涨较快，而牙刷价上涨价较慢等原因，算帐结果，资方表示，需亏空二十万左右，五月一日，当记者走访该厂时，劳资双方均在酝酿重新评定工资的问题，该厂经理向记者表示：他才读了报纸所载的李立三报告全文，他一连读了三遍，心眼里觉得完全开朗了，虽然上月有亏空，但据此精神，发展生产是有把握的。五月二日，工作组协同劳资双方，正式研究改订工资问题。由于厂方在四月份内帐目公开，厂方的亏空情形，就得到工人的谅解，李立三同志的报告，在工人中所发挥的作用更大，他们主动提出降低工资以利发展生产的要求。并将劳资契约中规定的：盈余中工人抽福利金百分之二十部分，改订为百分之十，将扩大再生产之资金扩大为百分之三十。此项协定劳资双方均表示满意，该厂经理并向工人表示：五月份经营结果如有盈余，工资尚可再作调整。该厂五月份生产，将在此基础上，巩固地稳步地前进。（康维中）
