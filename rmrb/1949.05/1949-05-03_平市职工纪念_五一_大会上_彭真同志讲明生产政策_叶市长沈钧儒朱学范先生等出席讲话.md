    [Special Dispatch from this newspaper] On May 1st, hundreds of thousands of workers in Beiping City held celebrations and symposiums, organized Yangko teams, and held costume parades all day long to commemorate their first own festival after the liberation of Ping City. On the same afternoon, representatives elected from various public and private enterprises and institutions in the city, totaling more than a thousand people, gathered at the Guomin Grand Theater on West Chang'an Street to celebrate grandly. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Ye Jianying, Mayor of the Beiping Municipal Government, and Mr. Zhu Xuefan of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions all came to provide guidance. Democratic personage Mr. Shen Junru, as well as more than ten representatives of capital, such as Mr. Chen Yintang, manager of Dahua Pottery Company, were also invited to participate. The meeting officially began at 5 p.m. in the solemn sound of the Internationale. First, the participating workers, with warm applause, approved Comrade Peng Zhen, Mayor Ye Jianying, Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Comrade Xu Liqun, Comrade Zhang Xiuyan, Comrade Gu Qicong, and worker representatives Xiao Ming, Sun Yishu, Li Qichun, Zhao Xien, and Li Lianshan as the presidium. Comrade Xiao Ming first reported on the significance of the meeting, pointing out that the commemoration meeting was held under the victorious situation, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu had issued marching orders, and the national liberation was just around the corner. He called on workers to commemorate "May Day" with practical actions: First, all workers should unite with intellectuals, the free bourgeoisie, and all peace-loving democrats to carry the revolution through to the end; Second, rapidly restore and develop production in Beiping, first of all, restore and transform it. All workers resolutely support Chairman Mao's policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital"; Third, establish and consolidate the organization of trade unions. More than 80 percent of the 70,000 industrial workers in Beiping have been organized, and more than 20,000 workers in various industries have been organized. These all need to be consolidated, and those who have not been organized need to be organized; Fourth, oppose the aggressive war waged by the world's counter-revolutionary forces headed by US imperialism. The workers of Beiping should unite with the workers of the world. Mayor Ye's speech elaborated on the significance of commemorating "May Day" and building a new Beiping. He pointed out: We are engaged in construction, working hard to produce, and supporting the front to achieve the final liberation of all of China. He said: The work of leveling the foundation for building this new democratic house has been basically completed, and we must continue to eliminate the enemy and continue to complete this work in the future; but engaging in construction is a longer and more arduous task. In the already liberated areas, such as North China, East China, and Northeast China, we must engage in construction, and the most central thing is economic construction. At this point, Mayor Ye repeatedly explained the all-round policies of "taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, doing a good job in urban and rural relations, and doing a good job in internal and external relations" in economic construction, pointing out that if the above policies are correctly implemented, the enthusiasm of workers will be improved, and capitalists will also benefit and their enthusiasm will also be improved, so that production can be developed. Mayor Ye also pointed out that in Beiping City, focusing on the central task of developing production, the following tasks must also be done well: First, in May, we must systematically establish people's power, completely destroy the Kuomintang's Baojia system, and the people should accuse those who have committed heinous crimes; but we should trust the government and hand them over to the government for trial and handling. Second, the public security work, although the destructive activities of secret agents and bandits in Ping City have gradually decreased, they have not been eliminated, so further work is still needed. Third, municipal transportation must be done well. The stalls set up by vendors without management and order have already hindered traffic and municipal order, and should be guided and sorted out. In addition, many non-productive people should be organized into production. Fourth, we must do a good job in the sanitation of the city and the citizens. Finally, he suggested that everyone give the government more opinions and strengthen contact with the government.
    Comrade Peng Zhen first reviewed the strength of the working class in simple and easy-to-understand words. He made a historical narration and analysis from the rise and fall of the world, China, the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces, that is, the changes in the comparison of class strengths. He said that before 1917, when the proletariat commemorated May Day, there was no socialist country in the world. After the First World War, the first proletarian country, socialist Soviet Union, was born. Although at the beginning of the founding of the Soviet Union, imperialists and their lackeys around the world surrounded the Soviet Union and wanted to crush it, they were defeated by the Soviet Union one by one. The situation after the Second World War was even more different: three of the six imperialist countries left over from the First World War were overthrown, and some of the remaining imperialists were also injured. On the other hand, the Soviet Union has become incomparably stronger, and many new democratic countries have been established in the world. In China, the People's Liberation Army has crossed the Yangtze River, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has come to an end. Which is stronger, the revolutionary forces or the counter-revolutionary forces in the world and China? Who can defeat whom? The matter is already very clear. Comrade Peng Zhen continued: Now that the facts have made a conclusion, the Chinese working class and its party can lead the Chinese people to defeat the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and establish a new democratic society in the liberated areas. But now some people doubt whether we can manage the city well. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: domestic and foreign reactionaries say that the Communist Party - the workers' party, can only manage the countryside well, but cannot manage the city well. Workers, can we and all the people manage the city well? We can. The current Beiping is already incomparably better than the Kuomintang rule era. But we have not done it completely well. The main reason is that production has not been well restored and developed, internal and external relations, urban and rural relations have not been well done, and our guidance on production and trade is still very insufficient; labor-capital relations have not been adjusted very well. To do a good job in production, we must solve some specific problems. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out one by one: First, in public enterprises, each factory should make a one-year plan (private factories can also do it), and the required raw materials, equipment, sales and other issues should be calculated. In addition, the old cadres in the liberated areas should unite well with all employees, and use education to improve them, and establish a factory management committee to solve the mass line problem in leadership through this democratic factory management organization. Then there is the establishment of a factory security committee to organize workers' inspection teams to protect the factory from loss. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that the painful lessons of the tram company should be learned. The employees of the company worked very hard to produce and achieved great results, but secret agents burned down 58 cars with a fire, which was a great loss. This loss is not only equal to four months of tax revenue in Beiping, but also the number of trams available to citizens every day has been reduced by dozens. Therefore, the work of protecting the factory must be strengthened. Regarding labor-capital disputes in private enterprises, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: The reason is that in the past, capitalists had long-term exploitation and oppression of workers, forming a labor-capital opposition. Besides, there are still a few capitalists who do not understand the overall situation and still want to excessively deduct workers, and some workers are indeed living very hard; but on the other hand, some workers do have excessive demands. They do not understand that the improvement of life must be subject to economic conditions, and can only be solved under the condition of mutual benefit. Some labor and capital parties do not know how to seek benefits from the development of production, nor do they know that if production is ruined, labor and capital will both lose and perish together, which is not conducive to society, not conducive to all the people, nor conducive to workers and capitalists. Comrade Peng Zhen also pointed out that in the future, labor-capital issues should be resolved one industry at a time under the unified leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and should be reported to the Municipal Labor Bureau for approval. Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen called on the workers of Beiping to study hard, improve their awareness, unite with people from all walks of life, and work together to restore and develop production in Beiping, victoriously build a new democratic country, and prove that our working class can lead all the people to manage the city well. Following Comrade Peng Zhen's speech, Mr. Zhu Xuefan of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions spoke. Democratic personage Mr. Shen Junru pointed out: The Kuomintang's peace conspiracy has completely failed, and the People's Liberation Army has victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and achieved a series of victories. He said: We believe that the liberation of Shanghai and other places is not far away. Regarding the work in the future, he proposed that we should develop production, practice strict economy, and support the front. In terms of supporting the front, he pointed out that the contribution of the people is very great. To capture Taiyuan, a large amount of manpower and material resources supported the front. This time crossing the river, the mobilization of manpower and material resources will be even greater. Therefore, we must develop production and practice strict economy. In developing production, he proposed that we should learn technology well. In other aspects, he also provided many valuable opinions. He expressed his complete agreement with the speeches of Comrade Peng Zhen and Mayor Ye Jianying, and praised the correctness of the CPC's policies. Finally, he proposed that he is willing to strive for the liberation of all of China and build a new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of China. Mr. Chen Yintang, the representative of the private enterprise factory, also expressed many opinions on how to implement various government policies. Comrade Xie Bangding of the All-China Students' Federation pointed out that the Chinese working class should closely combine with Chinese students and work together to build a new China. Comrade Li Lianshan, the representative of the railway workers, spoke, explaining how the railway workers after liberation came to welcome their festival. Before "May Day," the workers enthusiastically rushed to produce and repaired four completely unusable broken locomotives in a short period of time. He said that in the future, we must continue to increase production and strive to support the front to commemorate "May Day." Comrade Sun Yishu, the representative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, spoke, making a clear comparison between the past life of the workers and the present life. And pointed out that the series of victories of the Chinese revolution and the liberation of Beiping workers were brought by Chairman Mao. At this point, the conference held a flag presentation ceremony, and Mr. Zhu Xuefan of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Comrade Xiao Ming of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee received the flags. The conference also passed two telegrams. Finally, the North China University Cultural and Art Troupe performed the Red Flag Song, and it did not disperse until late at night.

    平市职工纪念“五一”大会上
    彭真同志讲明生产政策
    叶市长沈钧儒朱学范先生等出席讲话
    【本报特讯】五月一日，北平市数十万职工，分别举行庆祝会、座谈会，组织秧歌队，化装游行，狂欢终日，来纪念平市解放后的第一个自己的节日。同日下午，全市各公私营企业、机关职工复选派代表，共千余人在西长安街国民大戏院集会隆重庆祝，中共北平市委书记彭真同志、北平市政府叶剑英市长、中华全国总工会朱学范先生均亲临指导，民主人士沈钧儒先生，以及大华窑业公司陈荫棠经理等十余资方代表亦被邀参加。会议于下午五时在庄严的国际歌声中正式开始。首先与会职工以热烈的掌声通过彭真同志、叶剑英市长与朱学范先生、许立群同志、张秀岩同志、古奇琮同志，以及职工代表萧明、孙以恕、李启春、赵锡恩、李连山等同志为主席团。萧明同志首先报告开会意义，他指出纪念会是在胜利的形势下召开的，毛主席、朱总司令已发出进军命令，全国解放已为期不远。他号召工人以实际行动来纪念“五一”：一、全体职工，要团结知识分子、自由资产阶级、及一切爱好和平的民主人士，将革命进行到底；二、迅速恢复发展北平的生产，首先是恢复和改造，全体职工坚决拥护毛主席所指示的“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的政策；三、建立并巩固工会的组织，北平七万多产业工人，已组织起了百分之八十，各行业工人已组织起了两万多人，这都需要巩固，没有组织起来的，需要组织；四、反对以美帝国主义为首的世界反革命力量进行侵略战争，北平的职工，要与全世界的职工团结起来。叶市长讲话详细阐述纪念“五一”建设新北平的意义。他指出：我们从事建设，努力生产，支援前线，以取得全中国的最后解放。他说：建设新民主主义这所房子，铲平地基的工作，基本上已完成了，今后还要继续肃清敌人，继续完成此项工作；但是从事建设，这就是个时间更长的，更艰苦的工作。在已经解放了的地区，如华北、华东、东北等地，要从事建设，其中最中心的是经济建设。至此，叶市长反复解释经济建设中的“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡关系要搞好、内外关系要搞好”的四面八方的政策，指出正确地执行了以上的政策，工人的积极性提高了，资方有利可图、积极性也提高了，才能发展生产。叶市长并指出，在北平市，绕围着发展生产这一中心工作，并必须做好以下的工作：首先是在五月份要有系统地建立人民政权，彻底摧毁国民党的保甲制度，对罪大恶极分子，人民控诉是应该的；但应相信政府，交政府审判处理。其次是治安工作，目前平市特务盗匪的破坏活动虽逐渐减少，但没有消灭，因此尚需做进一步的工作。第三，市政交通要搞好，摊贩无管理无秩序的摆设，已经妨碍了交通和市政秩序，应该加以指导和整理。此外许多不生产的人，应该组织到生产中去。第四，即是要把市政和市民的卫生工作做好。最后，他提议，大家多多给政府提意见，加强与政府的联系。
    彭真同志首先以通俗易懂的话，检阅了工人阶级的力量。他从世界的、中国的、革命与反革命力量的消长，即阶级力量对比的变化，作了个历史的叙述和分析。他说直到一九一七年以前无产阶级纪念五一劳动节的时候，世界还没有社会主义的国家，第一次世界大战后，第一个无产阶级的国家社会主义的苏联降生了，虽然在苏联建国之始，举世帝国主义者及其走狗们包围苏联想把它压垮，但被苏联一个个打败了。第二次世界大战后的情况更不同了：第一次大战后所剩的六个帝国主义国家被打倒了三个，剩下的帝国主义也有的受了伤。另一方面，苏联更加无比的强大了，世界上建立了很多新民主主义的国家，在中国解放军已过了长江，国民党反动统治已告灭亡，世界和中国的革命力量与反革命力量比起来究竟谁的力量大？谁能战胜谁？事情已经很明显了。彭真同志继续说：现在事实已经作了结论，中国工人阶级及其政党可以领导中国人民战胜国民党反动统治，并在解放区建立新民主主义的社会，但现在还有人怀疑我们能不能管理好城市，彭真同志指出：国内外反动派，说共产党——工人的党，只能管好乡村，不能管好城市。工人同志们，我们和全体人民能不能管好城市？我们能。现在的北平已经比国民党统治时代好到不能相比。但是我们却还没有完全做好，主要的是生产还没有很好的恢复和发展，内外关系，城乡关系，还没有搞得很好，我们对于生产和贸易的指导还很不够；劳资关系还没有调整得很好。要搞好生产，必须解决一些具体问题，彭真同志一一指出：首先在公营企业方面，各厂要做一年的计划来（私营工厂也可以做），要把所需原料、器材、销路等问题统统计算在内，此外解放区的老干部要和全体员工团结好，并用教育来提高他们，并建立工厂管理委员会，通过这一民主的工厂管理机构来解决领导上的群众路线问题。再就是成立工厂保卫委员会，组织工人纠查队，以保护工厂不受损失。彭真同志指出应接受电车公司的惨痛教训。该公司职工都很努力生产，成绩很大，但特务一把火给烧掉了五十八辆车，这个损失是很大的。这个损失不仅是等于北平市的四个月的税收，而且市民每日都减少几十辆电车的交通工具。因此，必须加强保护工厂的工作。关于私营企业中的劳资纠纷问题，彭真同志指出：这个原因是在于过去资本家长期的剥削压迫工人，形成劳资对立，再说，现在也还有少数资方不明大义还想过分的克扣工人，而有部分工人生活又的确很苦；但另一方面，也确有一部分工人要求过高，他们不了解生活改善，要服从于经济条件。并且只能在两利条件下解决，有的劳资双方都不知道从发展生产中来谋取利益，也不知道生产搞垮了，劳资将两败俱伤同归于尽，不利于社会，不利于全体人民也不利于工人和资本家。彭真同志并指出今后劳资问题要在市总工会统一领导下，一个行业一个行业地来解决。并且要报市政府劳动局批准。最后，彭真同志号召北平的职工，要努力学习，提高自己的觉悟，团结各阶层的人民，来齐心协力的恢复与发展北平的生产，胜利地建设新民主主义的国家，来证明我们工人阶级是能够领导全体人民管好城市的。继彭真同志讲话之后，中华全国总工会朱学范先生讲话。民主人士沈钧儒先生讲话指出：国民党和平阴谋已完全失败，人民解放军胜利地渡过长江，并取得了一连串的胜利。他说：我们相信，上海等地的解放为期已经不远了。对于今后的工作，他提出应当发展生产，厉行节约，支援前线。在支援前线方面，他指出人民的贡献是很大的，打下太原，广大的人力物力支援了前线，这次的渡江，人力物力的动员会更大，因此，必须发展生产厉行节约。在发展生产中，他提出应很好学习技术。在其他方面，他也提供了不少宝贵的意见。他对彭真同志和叶剑英市长的讲话表示完全赞同，并盛赞中共政策的正确。最后，他提出，愿在中国共产党毛主席领导下，争取全中国的解放，建设新中国。私营企业厂方代表陈荫棠先生关于如何执行政府各项政策等问题亦发表不少意见。全国学联谢邦定同志指出，中国工人阶级应与中国学生密切结合，共同努力建设新中国。铁路职工代表李连山同志讲话，说明了解放后的铁路工人，是如何来迎接自己的节日。在“五一”前，职工们即以无比热情突击生产，于短期内修好了四辆完全不能用的破机车。他说，今后要继续提高生产，努力支援前线来纪念“五一”。石景山钢铁厂职工代表孙以恕同志讲话，把工人的过去生活与现在的生活作了一个鲜明的对比。并指出中国革命一连串的胜利，北平职工的解放，是毛主席带来的。大会至此，即举行献旗，由全国总工会朱学范先生及平市职工总会筹备会萧明同志受旗。大会并通过通电二则。最后，由华北大学文工团演出红旗歌，直至夜深方散。
