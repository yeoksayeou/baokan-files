    The North China People's Government Issues Instructions
    to Seriously Implement Gold and Silver Management

    [This newspaper reports] The North China People's Government recently issued instructions to governments at all levels, public security bureaus, and economic departments regarding the conscientious implementation of gold and silver management measures, along with explanations of points to note during the implementation of these measures. The instructions pointed out that the general gold and silver jewelry industry mostly focuses on reselling gold, with jewelry making merely serving as window dressing. This industry, both now and in the future, is not beneficial to the country's economic construction, and therefore, the industry has no future. Governments at all levels, in implementing management, should find ways to guide them to switch to other industries as soon as possible. Regarding the implementation of Article 9 of the management measures, the instructions specified in detail that the handling of gold carried should be differentiated based on the amount of gold carried, whether the carrier was unaware of government regulations or knowingly violated them but without suspicion of reselling, or whether there was indeed suspicion of reselling, and other circumstances. Those who smuggle to aid the enemy should have all their gold confiscated. Those who privately conduct small-scale transactions should have it exchanged at a devalued rate; if the amount is 20 silver dollars or 10 taels of silver or 3 qian of gold or more, it should be confiscated. If the quantity is large and the person is a repeat offender engaged in speculation, in addition to complete confiscation, a fine of one to three times the amount should be imposed. To prevent saboteurs from using this as a pretext for extortion, the instructions stipulate that formal receipts must be given for all cases of devaluation exchange, confiscation, or fines. When entering the residences of merchants or their business premises for investigation, only military police holding investigation documents are allowed to do so. The instructions believe that the thorough implementation of policies relies on the support of the masses, but in order to quickly stop speculation, rewards should also be given to those who have contributed to reporting and uncovering such activities.

    华北人民政府发布指示
    认真执行金银管理
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷对各级政府、公安局及经济部门发布关于认真执行金银管理办法的指示一件，并说明该办法执行中应注意之点。指示指出：一般金银首饰业，多以捣卖黄金为主，制作首饰仅系装璜门面，这一行业，无论现在与将来，对于国家经济建设均无好处，因之该业将来也无前途，各级政府在执行管理中，应设法引导其从速转业。关于执行管理办法第九条时，指示细密规定应按携带黄金分量、携带者是否因不了解政府法令，或明知故犯但无捣卖嫌疑，或确有捣卖嫌疑等，分别情节处理兑换。如因走私资敌者则应全部没收。如私相进行小额买卖者，应贬价兑换，如数量在银元二十枚或纹银十两或黄金三钱以上者，予以没收。如数量既大又系屡犯的投机分子，除全部没收外，并科以一至三倍的罚金。为防止破坏分子借名敲诈起见，指示规定：凡执行贬价兑换、没收、罚款情事，必须给予正式凭据，如入商民住宅或其营业所查缉时，只限于持有查缉文件的军警行之。指示认为贯彻政策执行，端赖群众拥护，但为收迅速制止投机之效，对于告发查获有功者，也给予奖励。
