    Private Radio Stations in Beiping Spread Decadent Music, Poisoning the People: Relevant Authorities Should Immediately Rectify Them

    [Reported by this newspaper] According to reader feedback: The four private radio stations in Beiping, established before liberation, are still broadcasting. Their programs still contain many backward and low-taste crosstalks, storytelling, old opera excerpts, and "popular songs," etc. The content either promotes feudal morality or obscene and erotic songs. Even the most indecent and erotic songs and ditties are being played, from seven in the morning until after one in the morning. The airwaves are filled with decadent music. In particular, the Minsheng Radio Station broadcasts such frivolous songs as "Meeting Doesn't Fear Being Late," "Waiting for You to Return," and "Waiting for My Love," etc. every day, which has a great impact on social education. Even some advertising programs contain certain toxins, such as "Imperial Made" "Rendan," the actual effect of which is quite questionable. These unhealthy phenomena should attract the attention of the Municipal Party authorities and be given appropriate treatment. First of all, it should be clearly prohibited to spread feudal and obscene content, and increase political and cultural education programs that are beneficial to the citizens. The Cultural Management Committee convened a meeting with artists from the performing arts circles. At the meeting, everyone agreed that the old tricks of the past must be quickly improved. This suggestion should be implemented among other artists and radio stations.

    平市私营广播电台靡靡之音毒害人民
    有关机关应即予以改造
    【本报讯】据读者反映：北平四家私营广播电台在解放前成立，现仍继续播音。他们所播节目，仍有不少落后的、低级趣味的相声、评书、旧剧清唱和“流行歌曲”等，内容不是宣传封建道德，就是污秽的色情歌曲，甚至连最不正派的色情狂的歌曲小调，也搬了出来，从早晨七点一直可以听到深夜一点多，无线电里到处可以听到靡靡之音。特别是民声广播电台天天播送什么：“相见不怕晚”、“等待你回来”、“候郎曲”等无聊歌子，对社会教育的影响很大。甚至一部分广告节目也包含若干毒素，什么“御制”“仁丹”之类，其实际效用如何，则颇可考虑。这些不健康的现象，应该引起市政党局的注意，给予适当的处理。首先应该明令禁止传播封建与污秽的东西，增加对市民有益的政治文化教育节目。文管会曾召集曲艺界艺人开会座谈，会上大家都认为过去的旧玩艺必须迅速加以改进。这一个建议，应该贯彻到其他艺人及广播电台中去。
