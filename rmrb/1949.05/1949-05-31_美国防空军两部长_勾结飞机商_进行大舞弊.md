Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th: Washington dispatch: A major corruption case concerning the U.S. Air Force Department's approval of aircraft purchase contracts has recently occurred in the United States, involving several high-ranking U.S. officials. According to a United Press report, Republican Congressman Van Zandt demanded in Congress an investigation into the circumstances of military aircraft orders and the truth about rumors that Air Force Secretary Symington would resign to become the manager of a "large aircraft company" after Congress approved appropriations to purchase more B-36 Superfortress bombers. He said that the billionaire Odlum, who controls the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation that manufactures the B-36 Superfortress, may control this new company. Shortly after taking office, new Defense Secretary Johnson hastily ordered an additional $183 million in orders from Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation, from which he had resigned as director and consultant only a few weeks prior. Last fall, Odlum actively helped Johnson, then chairman of the Democratic National Committee's finance committee, increase the party's campaign expenses. When the Air Force Department canceled other aircraft orders in January this year to purchase more B-36 Superfortress bombers, the new contract negotiations were conducted by a law firm closely associated with Odlum's company. TASS also reported that Van Zandt also suggested investigating the renegotiation of a contract with Emerson Electric Manufacturing Company, where Symington was the manager before becoming Secretary of the Air Force. He said that the machine gun mounts made by the company were unsatisfactory, but the contract was renegotiated with the government spending approximately $20 million.

　　美国防空军两部长
    勾结飞机商
    进行大舞弊
    【新华社北平三十日电】华盛顿消息：美国政府最近发生关于空军部批准定购飞机合同的巨大舞弊案，其中牵涉美国一些高级官员。据合众社讯，共和党众议员范展特在国会中要求调查定购军用飞机的情况，和外传空军部部长薛明顿等待国会批准拨款增购Ｂ-３６式超级轰炸机后，将辞职改任“大飞机公司”经理一事的真象。他说：现在控制着制造Ｂ-３６式超级轰炸机的沃尔梯飞机公司的亿万富豪奥布伦，可能控制这个新公司。新国防部部长詹逊就任后不久，就急急忙忙地下令与沃尔梯飞机公司增加一亿八千三百万美元的定货合同，而他是几周前才辞去该公司的董事和顾问的。去年秋季，奥布伦曾积极帮助当时任民主党全国委员会财政委员会主席的詹逊，增加该党的竞选费用。当今年一月空军部取消其他定购飞机的合同以购买更多的Ｂ-３６式超级轰炸机时，新合同的谈判是由与奥布伦公司有密切关系的律师事务所进行的。又据塔斯社报道：范展特还建议调查与伊默生电器制造公司重新商定合同的情况，薛明顿在出任空军部部长前，是该公司的经理。他说：该公司所造机枪座不能令人满意，结果却在政府出了约二千万美元的条件下，才重新商定合同。
