How to Produce During the Slack Season?
  The Tongzhou Industry and Commerce Bureau Invites Private Cotton Mills to Discuss Solutions
    Many Ideas, But the Issue of Female Workers Remains Unresolved

[Reported by this newspaper] The Tongzhou Industry and Commerce Bureau convened managers of various private cotton ginning factories to discuss ways to maintain production and overcome the slack season. Tongzhou is located at the end of the Grand Canal and is near the Tong County power plant, making cotton ginning a well-developed industry. The twelve private cotton ginning factories have 131 electric cotton gins and 14 manual gins, with a daily output of over 10,000 catties of ginned cotton. Tong County and the surrounding counties are cotton-producing areas in eastern Hebei. Before liberation, annual cotton production was controlled by the enemy and puppet regimes, who imposed exorbitant taxes and levies on the factories. Due to the difficulty in purchasing cotton after spring and to avoid excessive taxes, private cotton ginning factories were historically operational for only half the year and closed for the other half. After liberation, to support these factories, the People's Bank provided loans of one million yuan to Dehou and Yufeng factories. The city's supply and marketing cooperative trade department, to help the factories with capital turnover, purchased 1.45 million catties of seed cotton from Tong County and the Pinghan Railway line, enabling the factories to gin cotton for an additional two months this year. Currently, seed cotton is difficult to acquire from various regions, and the factories have largely processed their existing cotton stocks. Currently, only seventeen power-driven gins are still in operation, while the rest have ceased production, and workers have been laid off accordingly. Recognizing that the factories' production is entering a slack season, the City Industry and Commerce Bureau held a symposium for the managers of various factories earlier this month to discuss ways to maintain production. At the meeting, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, in addition to explaining the government's efforts to help, emphasized that self-reliance and brainstorming were the most important ways to formulate a production plan for the slack season. Finally, the Bureau requested that the factories report their annual cotton ginning needs in order to facilitate planned adjustments in the coming year. The factory managers expressed their gratitude to the government, stating that this kind of concern was unheard of before liberation. The factory managers discussed their plans with each other at the meeting. As a result, four factories plan to purchase cotton from Jinzhou, Baoding, and central Hebei, and requested the government's introduction and certification; two factories plan to install electric mills to grind flour, buy coal briquettes, and produce cottonseed oil soap; three factories plan to process and sell ginned cotton; one factory plans to weave cloth; one factory, lacking outside workers, plans to distribute the People's Daily in addition to ginning cotton; and the other two factories have no plans and are still planning. However, it is understood that the plans formulated by the factories will at most provide work for technicians and staff, and there is still no solution for the hundreds of unemployed female workers. Secondly, the current period is the cotton ginning slack season, and there is also little cotton in storage in various regions. It is difficult to buy back much cotton when going out to purchase it. Now that unemployed female workers are demanding work and the factories are also demanding production, the city leadership still needs to further cooperate with the factories to study and organize production during the slack season.

　　背月如何生产？
  　通州工商局邀私营棉厂研究出路
    办法不少，唯女工问题尚未解决
    【本报讯】通州市工商局召集各私营轧棉厂经理研究生产门路，以渡过生产上的背月。通市位于运河终点，附近有通县发电厂，轧棉业最为发达，十二家私营轧棉厂容有电力轧棉机一三一架，人力机十四架，日可出皮棉万余斤。通县及周围各县为冀东棉产区，解放前每年产棉均为敌伪控制，并以苛捐摊派加诸各厂，私营轧棉厂因春后购棉困难，并为少拿苛税，历年半年开工半年歇业。解放后政府为扶助各厂，人民银行曾给德厚、裕丰两厂贷款一百万元，市供销社贸易处为帮助各厂资金周转，由通县及平汉线收购籽棉一四五万斤，使各厂今年多轧棉两月。目前各地籽棉难以收购，各厂存棉大部轧完，现除十七架动力机尚在轧棉外，其余均已停工，工人亦随之失业。市工商局鉴于各厂生产进入背月，本月上旬特召集各厂经理座谈生产门路。会上工商局除说明政府努力帮助外，主要靠大家自力更生多想办法，制订背月生产计划，最后要求各厂报告全年轧棉需要量，以备来年有计划调剂。各厂经理对政府甚表感谢，认为此种关怀是解放前没有的事。各厂经理在会上互相谈论自己计划。结果有四家准备到锦州、保定、冀中购棉，要求政府介绍证明；有两家计划按置电磨磨面、买煤球、制棉籽油肥皂，有三家准备弹轧熟棉销售；一家准备织布；一家因无外工，除弹棉外，兼发人民日报；另外两家没有门路，正在计划中。但据了解，各厂所订计划至多使技工与职员有工可做，百余失业女工仍无办法。其次，目前适值轧棉背月，各地存棉亦少，出外购棉，很难买回很多。现失业女工要求工作，各厂亦要求生产，市领导上尚需进一步协同各厂研究组织背月生产。
