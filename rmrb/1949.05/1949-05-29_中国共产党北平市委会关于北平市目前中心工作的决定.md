Decision of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee on the Current Central Tasks of Beijing
(Approved by the Municipal Committee on April 16, 1949)

I. According to the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Party, the focus of the Party's work has now shifted from the countryside to the cities. The central task of urban work is to restore and develop production. Now we have smoothly completed various takeover tasks in Beijing, have initially established a revolutionary political and economic order, and have carried out some organizational and educational work among the masses. At present, Beijing's production has been considerably restored and has created some favorable conditions for further restoration and development in the future. However, because the urban-rural economic relationship, which was destroyed in the long war, has not yet been restored, and foreign trade is still in a state of intermittent operation; because we still lack due guidance on the direction of public and private production and trade, and on the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products for public and private enterprises; in private enterprises, there are still chaotic labor-capital disputes, and among the working class, especially cadres, there are still "leftist" deviations, while capitalists still have many concerns and some tendencies that disregard the overall situation; in public enterprises, many of our leading cadres are not good at relying on the working masses, are not good at using factory management committees to manage factories, and are very poor at organizing and educating the working class itself. Therefore, the restoration and development of production in Beijing still faces serious difficulties and shortcomings. The Party must systematically solve these problems and concentrate more strong cadres to lead the work of restoring and developing production and the basic force on which the restoration and development of production depends, namely, the work among the working class. In the restoration and development of production, we must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and implement the comprehensive policy of "taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other in urban and rural areas, and exchanging with both domestic and foreign markets," that is, the "four-way" policy. Restoring, transforming and developing production is the current common central task of the Party, government, army and people of Beijing, and all other work should revolve around and be subordinate to this central task.

II. In order to effectively restore, transform and develop Beijing's production, we must:

	First, based on the existing conditions, quickly formulate a general plan to guide the city's public and private production and trade, to give public enterprises, private enterprises, organ production, and urban and rural handicrafts guidance on the direction of production and trade, in order to reduce the blindness and anarchic state in production and trade. To this end, all state-owned factories and larger private factories and workshops must be ordered to quickly formulate a one-year production plan for each unit. This plan must detail the existing production conditions, required raw materials and the planned output, sales, cost, and the equipment and worker benefits that need to be supplemented; all industrial and commercial enterprises must be ordered to conduct detailed registration in order to understand the city's production and supply and demand situation, otherwise it will be impossible to formulate a plan to guide industry and commerce.

	Second, the priority in restoring and developing production should first be to restore and develop all industries, transportation and commerce that can export to the countryside and supply the citizens with beneficial national livelihoods and are conducive to the recovery and development of production. In terms of industry, from the perspective of long-term development, the first priority should be state-owned industry (including organ factories) and joint state-private industry, the second should be private industry that benefits the national livelihood, and the third should be organ handicraft production and urban and rural handicrafts. However, in the current specific situation of Beijing, the restoration of private industry that benefits the national livelihood must be given the same importance as state-owned industry. Secondly, in terms of steps, the first step is generally to restore, transform and fully utilize the existing industry, and then to establish new industry.

	Third, workers are the main force and most basic reliance for us to restore and develop industrial production. Their organization and degree of awareness are the first key to determining the success or failure of restoring and developing production and other urban construction work. The Party must carry out systematic organization and education work among the working class, and strive to organize the vast majority of the city's workers within one or two years, first of all to organize the workers of state-owned factories and private factories and workshops, and the shop assistants of large stores. For the work of various handicraft workers, coolies and other shop assistants, we should first prepare and train a group of sound cadres who can grasp the Party's policies, and carry out the work step by step.

	Our trade union work must organize all manual and intellectual laborers who rely on wages and salaries for their livelihoods, and universally improve their class consciousness. However, when implementing this, we must proceed with emphasis, step by step, and steadily, and prevent acute diseases. In addition, when carrying out work among handicraft workers and shop assistants, we should prevent the tendency of guildism, and especially not send cadres with guildism tendencies and who only care about the workers' immediate suicidal "local interests" (such as excessively high labor conditions that are sufficient to destroy or shrink the enterprise, lax labor discipline, etc.) to do the work of handicraft workers and shop assistants. All trade union cadres must learn to master the Party Central Committee's comprehensive "four-way" policy.

	Fourth, in state-owned factories, under the leadership of military representatives and factory directors, we must establish and improve factory management committees (worker representatives should account for half of the seats). Administrative cadres of state-owned enterprises must be good at relying on the working masses, establishing centralized factory management on a democratic basis, and be good at relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers to improve and develop factory production. This is an important key to restoring and developing the production of state-owned enterprises.

	Fifth, correctly and systematically handling labor-capital disputes and adjusting and stabilizing labor-capital relations to improve the production enthusiasm of both labor and capital is an important key to restoring and developing private production at present. We must educate workers and capitalists to truly understand that in a new democratic society, private production can only be developed by implementing a policy that benefits both labor and capital; at the same time, the economic status of both labor and capital can only be further improved on the basis of restoring, expanding and developing production. Any act that hinders the restoration and development of production, and any "single-benefit" policy that only takes into account the interests of one party, is a policy that will lead to the mutual destruction of both labor and capital, and can only be a suicidal policy that harms others without benefiting oneself. Workers must be made to fully understand that under the current conditions, a general increase in workers' wages is impossible without developing production, and only some partial and possible improvements can be made. Capitalists must understand that their past policy of one-sidedly and passively seeking profits by deducting from workers is wrong, and they should actively seek profits from the basis of labor-capital cooperation in developing production, improving production, increasing the quantity, improving the quality, lowering the cost, and benefiting both labor and capital. Without solving this ideological problem, it will be impossible to restore and develop the production of private enterprises.

	In the future, all labor-capital disputes must be resolved through the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Government Labor Bureau. The Federation of Trade Unions must seize the time to conduct investigation and research, and systematically resolve the existing disputes between labor and capital industry by industry.

	Sixth, the city's industrial production not only relies on raw materials from the countryside, but also its market is mainly in the countryside. In addition, a considerable number of handicraft industries, such as the carpet industry, have their markets almost entirely abroad. At the same time, many industries need to purchase machinery and supplementary raw materials from foreign countries. However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the organic link of the urban-rural economic relationship has long been destroyed, and the foreign trade after the liberation of Beijing has not yet been restored to normal; in addition, there are some unreasonable controls on trade in some areas. Now we must open up and use great efforts to restore and develop urban-rural trade, and restore foreign trade as much as possible. To this end, in addition to strengthening the work of the Municipal Trade Bureau, the People's Government must also establish a special agency to guide urban-rural trade and guide foreign trade, and absorb experienced private merchants to participate in this work. We must mobilize and organize various relationships and merchants who have engaged in urban-rural trade and import and export trade, in accordance with the government's policies, to quickly restore urban-rural trade and import and export trade, in order to promote and assist the restoration and development of production. In addition, a price negotiation committee should be established under the Financial and Economic Committee to evaluate the prices of certain products of state-owned enterprises under the policy of facilitating the restoration and development of production.

	Seventh, we should review the old and formulate new tax rules in accordance with the policy of restoring and developing production.

	Eighth, we should immediately determine the protection of the ownership of urban housing and the freedom of its sale, purchase, and lease, and solve the problem of agricultural land in the suburbs, in order to facilitate production.

III. In order to smoothly restore and transform production and other construction undertakings, we must further consolidate the revolutionary order. Especially after we have eliminated the enemies with guns, the hidden struggle will be more intense, and we must not relax our struggle against them for a moment, and strive to defeat them in the struggle.

	First, on the basis of thoroughly crushing the old power organs, we must establish new people's power organs that are closely connected with the masses. The Baojia system, the grassroots organization of the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary regime, should be abolished. The masses should be allowed to accuse Baojia personnel, policemen with serious misconduct, and local bullies who are hated by the masses. However, it must be carried out with leadership, preparation, and order, and handled by the people's court according to law. The people must be good at using their own people's power and laws as weapons to fight against counter-revolutionaries, and must never adopt backward methods such as hanging and beating to carry out this struggle. When the court sentences the above-mentioned cases, the defendant should also be ordered to attend and listen to the defendant's defense. However, the defendant should generally not be allowed to attend when the masses are accusing. For the old staff members in other government agencies, they should be examined and dealt with separately according to different situations, such as counter-revolutionaries, corrupt officials, incompetent personnel who can be retained according to their talents, and competent personnel who are retained.

	Second, the Kuomintang secret agents lurking in Beijing should continue to be purged. In particular, we must establish active reconnaissance and mass defense work. First of all, factory defense committees and worker pickets should be established in state-owned enterprises to protect the enterprises from sabotage.

	Third, certain old bureaucratic institutions in state-owned enterprise departments should be abolished or transformed according to the circumstances. All counter-revolutionaries should be removed from the leadership of enterprises, and new leadership cores should be formed by personnel with production experience from old liberated areas, underground Party members, and progressive workers and staff members to lead and transform the institutions and work of each department.

IV. The workers and other working people, young intellectuals, various experts and technicians should be given universal theoretical and political education to improve their political consciousness, which is one of the important tasks at present.

	First, we should seize the training of a large number of activists and cadres of workers and students.

	Second, we should train a group of political teachers or propagandists; first of all, we should seize the learning of incumbent cadres.

	Third, we should adopt all possible methods, such as short-term training courses, radio, newspapers, pamphlets, night schools, etc., to carry out the above-mentioned education.

	Fourth, for all public schools, especially primary and secondary schools, we should send people who can implement our educational policies to work, in order to strengthen the ideological and political education of students.

	Fifth, universities, middle schools and complete primary schools should set up adult literacy schools to provide cultural and political education to illiterate workers, especially workers. All primary and secondary schools should try to admit workers' children as soon as possible.

V. All organs and departments should earnestly examine the phenomenon of anarchy and indiscipline in themselves and their subordinate organizations. Those who violate discipline should be given serious criticism and punishment. The results of the examination should be written into a written report.

VI. In the future, we should often convene Party representative meetings within the Party, and worker representative meetings, farmer representative meetings, political symposiums with non-Party members, economic symposiums with industry and commerce, cultural and educational symposiums, and various small symposiums to solve specialized problems outside the Party.

In terms of style, we must continue to overcome the sloppy style formed by the past rural environment and the newly grown closed-doorism, sectarianism, commandism, bureaucracy and red tape in the city. We must develop scientific working methods suitable for urban and industrial environments.

　　中国共产党北平市委会关于北平市目前中心工作的决定
    （一九四九年四月十六日市委会通过）
    一、根据党的二中全会的精神，目前党的工作重心已由乡村转移到城市。城市工作的中心任务则是恢复与发展生产。现在我们在北平已经顺利地完成了各项接收工作，已经初步地建立了革命的政治秩序与经济秩序，并在群众中进行了一些组织与教育工作。目前北平生产已经有了相当的恢复，并为今后的进一步恢复与发展造成了一些有利条件。但因为在长期战争中被破坏了的城乡经济关系，尚未恢复，而对外贸易又尚处于时断时续的状态中，因为我们关于公私生产与贸易的方向及公私企业原料的供应与成品的销路，都还缺乏应有的指导；在私营企业方面，还存在着繁乱的劳资纠纷，在工人群众特别是干部中，还存在着左的偏向，在资本家方面则还有不少的顾虑及部分不顾大局的倾向；在公营企业方面，我们有不少领导干部，还不善于倚靠工人群众，不善于运用工厂管理委员会来管理工厂，而对于工人阶级本身的组织和教育工作又还很差，因此北平生产的恢复与发展，还存在着严重的困难与缺点。党必须系统地解决这些问题，并集中更多的强的干部来领导生产的恢复与发展工作及恢复发展生产所依靠的基本力量，即工人阶级中的工作。在恢复与发展生产中，必须切实按照毛主席的指示，贯彻公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流，即“四面八方”的全面政策。恢复改造与发展生产，乃是北平党政军民目前共同的中心任务，其他一切工作，都应该围绕着这一中心任务来进行。并服从这一任务。
    二、为了切实有效地恢复、改造与发展北平的生产，我们必须：
    第一、根据已有的条件，迅速订出指导本市公私生产与贸易之大体的计划，给公营企业、私营企业、机关生产和城乡手工业以生产与贸易之方向的指导，以减少生产与贸易方面的盲目性与无政府状态。为此，必须限令一切公营工厂与较大之私营工厂、作坊，迅速订出各单位一年的生产计划。在是项计划中，必须详列已有的生产条件、所需原料和预定的产量、销路、成本费及所需补充的器材与工人待遇等；必须限令一切工商业进行详细登记，以便了解全市生产状况与供求状况，否则就不可能订出指导工商业的计划。
    第二、在恢复与发展生产的重点上，首先应是恢复与发展一切可以向农村输出和供给市民的有益国民生计的工业、运输业和有利生产恢复与发展的商业。在工业方面，从长期的发展方针来说，第一位应是公营工业（包括机关工厂）及公私合办的工业，第二位应是有益国民生计的私营工业，第三位应是机关手工生产和城乡手工业。但在目前北平的具体情况下，对于恢复有益国民生计之私营工业，必须和公营工业一样予以重视。其次在步骤上，目前一般地首先应是恢复、改造与充分运用已有的工业，然后才是建立新的工业。
    第三、工人是我们恢复与发展工业生产的主力和最基本的依靠，他们的组织与觉悟程度如何，乃是决定恢复与发展生产及城市其他建设工作成败的第一个关键。党必须在工人阶级中，进行系统地组织与教育工作。并争取在一、二年内把本市工人群众的绝大多数组织起来，首先是把公营工厂和私营工厂、作坊的工人和大商店的店员组织起来。对于各种手工业工人、苦力和其他店员的工作，应先准备与训练一批健全的能掌握党的政策的干部，有步骤地来开展。
    我们的工会工作，必须把一切靠工钱薪金为生的体力与智力劳动者组织起来，并普遍地提高其阶阶觉悟。但执行时必须有重点、有步骤、稳步地推进，要防止急性病。此外，在进行手工业工人与店员工作时，应防止行会主义的倾向，尤其不要派有行会主义倾向和只顾工人眼前的带自杀性的“局部利益”（如足以使企业毁灭或缩小的过高的劳动条件，劳动纪律废弛等）的干部去作手工业工人与店员的工作。一切工会工作的干部，必须学会掌握党中央的四面八方的全面政策。
    第四、在公营工厂中，要在军事代表及厂长领导下，建立和健全工厂管理委员会（工人代表应占半数）。公营企业的行政干部，要善于依靠工人群众，在民主基础上，建立集中的工厂管理，要善于依靠广大工人群众的积极性与创造性，来改进和发展工厂的生产，这是恢复和发展公营企业生产的重要关键。
    第五、正确地系统地处理劳资纠纷，调整与稳定劳资关系，以提高劳资双方的生产积极性，乃是目前恢复与发展私营生产的重要关键，必须教育工人与资本家，真正了解：在新民主主义社会中，只有实行劳资两利政策，才能发展私营生产；同时，也只有在恢复并且扩大与发展生产的基础上，才能进一步改善劳资双方的经济地位。任何妨碍生产的恢复与发展，任何只顾一方面利益的“单利”政策，都是使劳资两败俱伤同归于尽的政策，都只能是一种损人而不能利己的自杀政策。必须使工人充分了解：在目前的条件下，若不发展生产，工人工资之一般提高是不可能的，只能作若干部分的与可能的改善。必须使资本家了解：他们过去那种片面地消极地只图从克扣工人来谋取利润的政策是错误的，应该积极地从劳资协力发展生产、改进生产，从生产的数量多、质量好、成本低，从劳资两利的基础上来谋取利润。这个思想问题不解决，私营企业生产之恢复与发展乃是不可能的。
    今后所有劳资纠纷，一律须经过市总工会与市政府劳动局来解决。总工会必须抓紧时间进行调查研究，一业一业地系统地解决劳资间已有的纠纷。
    第六、本市的工业生产不仅仰给于乡村的原料，而且市场主要是在乡村。此外，有相当数量的手艺工业，如地毯业等的市场，则几乎全部在国外。同时又有不少工业，需要从外国购入机器与补充原料。但自抗战以来，城乡经济关系的有机联系早已破坏，而北平解放后的对外贸易，又迄未正常恢复；加以现在有些地区对贸易有若干不合理的控制，现在必须打通并用极大力量恢复和发展城乡贸易，尽可能恢复对外贸易。为此，除应加强市贸易局工作外，人民政府还必须建立指导城乡贸易和指导对外贸易的专门机构，并吸收有经验的私商参加是项工作。必须动员、组织各种曾经经营城乡贸易和出入口贸易的关系和商人，按照政府的政策，来迅速恢复城乡的贸易与出入口贸易。以促进与协助生产之恢复与发展。此外，在财经委员会下应设立议价委员会，在便利恢复与发展生产的方针下，评定公营企业某些产品之价格。
    第七、应根据恢复与发展生产的方针，审查旧的并拟定新的税则。
    第八、应即确定保护城市房屋所有权及其买卖、租赁之自由，并解决郊区农业土地问题，以利生产的进行。
    三、为了顺利地恢复与改造生产及其他建设事业，我们必须进一步巩固革命秩序。特别是在我们消灭了拿枪的敌人之后，隐蔽的斗争将更激烈，我们必须一刻不放松对他们的斗争，努力在斗争中战胜他们。
    第一、必须在彻底粉碎旧的政权机构的基础上，建立崭新的与群众密切联系的人民政权的机构。应废除国民党反革命政权基层机构的保甲制度。对于群众所痛恨的保甲人员、劣迹严重的警察和恶霸分子，应允许群众控诉。但必须是有领导、有准备、有秩序地进行，并且由人民法庭依法处理。人民群众必须善于用人民自己的政权和法律作武器，来与反革命分子作斗争，决不可采取吊打等落后的方式来进行这种斗争。在法庭判处上述案件时，应令被告也出席，并听取被告声辩。但群众控诉时一般地不应让被告到会。对于在其他政府机关的旧职员，应分别反革命分子、贪污腐化分子、不称职但可以量才留用的和称职留用的人员等不同的情况，加以审查，分别处理。
    第二、对于潜伏在北平市内的国民党特务分子，应继续予以肃清。尤其要建立积极的侦察和群众性的保卫工作。首先应在公营企业中，建立工厂保卫委员会和工人纠察队，以保护企业，不受破坏。
    第三、对于公营企业部门中某些旧的官僚化的机构，应分别情况加以废除或改造。应从企业领导中清除一切反革命分子，并以老解放区干部和地下党员与职工进步分子中的有生产经验的人员形成新的领导核心，来领导与改造各该部门的机构与工作。
    四、对工人及其他劳动人民与青年知识分子与各种专家和技术人员，应进行普遍的理论与政治教育，以提高其政治觉悟，这乃是目前重要工作之一。
    第一、应抓紧训练大批的工人和学生的积极分子和干部。
    第二、训练一批政治教员或宣传员；首先是抓紧在职干部的学习。
    第三、应采取一切可能的方法，如通过短训班、广播、报纸、小册子、夜校等形式，进行上述教育。
    第四、对于一切公立的学校，特别是中小学校，应派能够执行我们的教育方针的人去工作，借以加强对学生的思想政治教育。
    第五、各大学、中学与完小，应设成人补习学校，给失学的劳动人民首先是工人以文化和政治教育。各中小学校应设法尽先吸收工人子弟入学。
    五、各机关、各部门应切实检讨自己和所属各组织的无政府无纪律性现象。对于违犯纪律的分子应予以严肃的批评与处分。检讨的结果应写成书面报告。
    六、我们今后在党内应经常召开党的代表会议，在党外应经常召开工人代表会议、农民代表会议和党外人士的政治座谈会、工商界的经济座谈会、文教座谈会及其他解决专门问题的各种小型座谈会。
    在作风上要继续克服由于过去农村环境所养成的散漫作风及在城市中新生长的关门主义、宗派主义、命令主义、官僚主义与文牍主义。要养成适合于城市与工业环境的科学的工作方法。
