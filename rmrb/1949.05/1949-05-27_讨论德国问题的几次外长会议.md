Several Foreign Ministers' Conferences on the German Question
    Hu Weide
    The Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference mainly discussing the German question has already opened. At this time, let us review the situation of the previous Foreign Ministers' conferences that discussed the German question.

    The Foreign Ministers' Conference was authorized to discuss the German question based on the joint decision of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Great Britain at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. The Potsdam Agreement stipulated: "The Foreign Ministers' Conference will be responsible for preparing the peace treaty with Germany, which will be accepted by the German government when a suitable German government is established."

    Since the Potsdam Conference, there have been four Foreign Ministers' conferences discussing the German question. The first was the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, held from April 25 to July 12, 1946 (with a one-month recess in the middle). The second was the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference, held from November 14 to December 25, 1946. The third was the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, held from March 10 to April 24, 1947. The fourth was the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, held from November 25 to December 15, 1947. The Paris Conference and the New York Conference only discussed the German question incidentally. The Moscow Conference and the London Conference mainly discussed the German question.

    At the Paris Conference, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the Great Britain, and France generally discussed the German question. The four foreign ministers separately elaborated their opinions on how to end the military control of Germany, how to sign the peace treaty with Germany, Germany's future military, economic, and political policies, Germany's reparations, and Germany's economic unification, but no specific decisions were made.

    At the New York Conference, the foreign ministers extensively exchanged opinions on the agenda of the future Moscow Conference. Regarding this matter, the conference reached a general agreement. After the New York Conference, the assistants of the four foreign ministers held another six-week meeting in London (January 14 to February 25, 1947). The assistant conference listened to the various opinions of nine allied countries on the German peace treaty, and drafted two reports to be submitted to the Moscow Conference on the procedural issues of concluding the German peace treaty: one was a joint report that had been agreed upon, mainly concerning the procedural issues of the Moscow Conference; the other was a separate report on unresolved issues, mainly concerning the procedures for other allied countries to provide opinions in the work of concluding the German peace treaty.

    The Moscow Conference was the first Foreign Ministers' conference that devoted the vast majority of its time to discussing the German question. At this conference, the four foreign ministers first listened to the work report of the German Control Council. Regarding the work report of the Control Council, the economic principles, political principles, reparations principles, the issue of the German interim government, the issue of German borders, the issue of the Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar, and the procedure for concluding the German peace treaty in the draft German peace treaty, the four foreign ministers conducted extensive debates at the meeting and had sharp struggles. The debates and struggles at the Moscow Conference clearly exposed the existence of two lines in resolving the German question: one was the Soviet line: it firmly advocated resolving the German question in accordance with the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements; the other was the American line, which attempted to tamper with or abandon the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements in resolving the German question. The two lines were very clear in the discussion of the "Four-Power Treaty on the Demilitarization of Germany" proposed by the United States. According to the U.S. draft, to prevent Germany's re-aggression, it was enough to "demilitarize" Germany without the need for anything else; and the spirit of the so-called "demilitarization" was different from the Potsdam Agreement. The U.S. draft was actually a negation of the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet side criticized the U.S. draft, pointing out that it did not involve the issue of eliminating Nazism, did not emphasize the establishment of a democratic order in Germany, did not stipulate in strong terms the abolition of monopoly enterprises such as companies, trusts, cartels, and banks and their nationalization, did not stipulate land reform, and did not recognize the four-country co-management of the Ruhr heavy industrial zone, etc. The Soviet side formulated a complete draft based on the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, which included important principles such as Germany's demilitarization, democratization, fulfillment of reparations obligations, four-country co-management of the Ruhr, abolition of German monopoly organizations, and confiscation of the land of the Junker aristocracy, which is the famous "Treaty Draft on Eliminating German Militarism and Preventing German Aggression." No decision was made on this issue at the Moscow Conference. The Moscow Conference failed to make decisions on the most important issues. However, the conference reached agreements on some minor issues, it passed a resolution abolishing the state of Prussia, reached an agreement on the issue of so-called "foreign immigrants" and the adjustment of German territory, passed a resolution on the issue of repatriating German prisoners of war, and made progress on the procedural issues of concluding the German peace treaty. This is the general overview of the Moscow Conference.

    The London Conference was no better than the Moscow Conference. The London Conference failed to reach agreement on two basic issues: first, the issue of the German peace treaty; second, the issue of rebuilding German unity. Regarding the significance of concluding a German peace treaty, the Soviet representative pointed out at the meeting that this would mean the end of the uncertain situation and the establishment of complete peace in Europe, and not only Europe but all peace-loving countries were concerned about the resolution of this issue. The Soviet representative insisted that the Foreign Ministers' Conference should handle this main task. However, the U.S. representative stubbornly resisted, attempting to completely remove the entire issue of the German peace treaty from the agenda, and only extracted the issue of German borders from the complete issue for discussion. Thus, due to the U.S. policy of delay, the issue of the German peace treaty was shelved at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Why is it necessary to rebuild German unity? The Soviet representative pointed out at the meeting that this was a matter of vital importance for the general development of the German people; the principles of German democratization and demilitarization passed by the Potsdam Conference must be implemented throughout Germany; Germany's fulfillment of its obligations to countries that suffered from Hitler's aggression and occupation also depended on the rebuilding of German unity. The Soviet representative went on to point out that it was impossible for German unity to be rebuilt on a democratic and peaceful basis without the active participation of the German people's democratic forces. Therefore, the Soviet delegation proposed to start organizing a German central government in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. In practical terms, the Soviet Union suggested that the Potsdam Conference's decision to establish central agencies for finance, transportation, communications, foreign trade, industry, agriculture, and food should be implemented, believing that this was the first step towards establishing a German central government. The Soviet Union also suggested forming a German Consultative Committee in Berlin, composed of representatives from various provinces, representatives from all German democratic parties, and representatives from free trade unions and other important anti-Nazi organizations. The establishment of a German central government, various central economic agencies, and the Berlin Consultative Committee was an effective way to rebuild German unity with the active participation of the German people's democratic forces. However, this Soviet proposal was rejected by the U.S., British, and French representatives. Regarding this issue, the U.S., British, and French representatives also put forward their own proposals at the London Conference, using the pretext of preventing the restoration of a centralized German empire, and at the expense of violating the development process of modern democratic countries, attempted to push Germany backwards, advocating the so-called "all power to the states" (or "German federalization"), with only certain minor powers being assigned to the various central agencies of Germany. The purpose of this plan was to split Germany and destroy an independent and unified Germany. And this policy in violation of the Potsdam Agreement has been practically implemented in the western occupied zones of Germany since 1946. Thus, the London Conference failed.

    Such were the situations of the previous Foreign Ministers' conferences discussing the German question.

    What issues can be seen from these Foreign Ministers' conferences?

    First, regarding the German question, the Foreign Ministers' conferences have reached agreements on some minor aspects, but have completely failed to reach agreements on important aspects.

    Second, the divergence of the Foreign Ministers' conferences shows that there are two different lines: one is the Soviet Union, which demands democratic peace and requires the implementation of the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements in resolving the German question; the other is the U.S., British, and French bloc, which demands imperialist peace and requires the abandonment of the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements in resolving the German question.

    Third, the U.S. ruling group's policy should be held responsible for the failure of the Foreign Ministers' conferences. The U.S. policy is to split Germany, split Europe, and prepare for a new world war.

    Fourth, in the new Foreign Ministers' conference, as long as everyone acts in accordance with the jointly signed Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, then the German question still has the possibility of being resolved correctly, which has been proven by the experience of being able to reach agreements in the previous Foreign Ministers' conferences.

　　讨论德国问题的几次外长会议
    胡韦德
    主要讨论德国问题的巴黎四国外长会议已经开幕。在这个时候，让我们回顾一下过去讨论德国问题的几次外长会议的情形吧。
    外长会议受权讨论德国问题，是根据一九四五年苏美英三国在波茨坦会议上的共同决定。波茨坦协议规定：“外长会议将负责准备对德和约，对德和约将于合乎目的的德国政府成立时，由德国政府予以接受。”
    在波茨坦会议以后，一共有四次外长会议讨论过德国问题。第一次是巴黎外长会议，自一九四六年四月二十五日至七月十二日举行（中间曾休会一月）。第二次是纽约外长会议，自一九四六年十一月十四日至十二月二十五日举行。第三次是莫斯科外长会议，自一九四七年三月十日至四月二十四日举行。第四次是伦敦外长会议，自一九四七年十一月二十五日至十二月十五日举行。巴黎会议和纽约会议，都只是附带地讨论德国问题，莫斯科会议和伦敦会议，主要是讨论德国问题。
    在巴黎会议上，苏美英法四国外长曾一般地讨论了德国问题。关于如何结束德国的军事管制，如何签订对德和约，德国今后的军事、经济、政治方针，德国的赔偿以及德国的经济统一等问题，四外长曾分别阐述了他们的意见，未作任何具体决定。
    在纽约会议上，各外长曾就未来莫斯科会议的议程问题广泛地交换意见。关于此事，会议取得一般的协议。在纽约会议之后，四国外长助理又在伦敦举行六周（一九四七年一月十四日至二月二十五日）的会议。助理会议曾听取九个盟国对德国和约的各种意见，并草拟关于缔结对德和约的程序问题向莫斯科会议提出的两种报告：一为已获协议的共同报告，主要是莫斯科会议的程序问题；一为未解决问题的分别报告，主要是其他盟国在缔结对德和约工作中提供意见的程序问题。
    莫斯科会议是第一次以绝大部分时间讨论德国问题的外长会议。在这次会议上，四国外长首先听取德国管制委员会的工作报告。关于管委会的工作报告，德国和约草案中的经济原则、政治原则、赔偿原则、德国临时政府问题、德国边界问题、鲁尔、莱茵与萨尔问题以及缔结德国和约的程序等问题，四国外长曾在会上展开了广泛的辩论，并曾发生尖锐的斗争。莫斯科会议上的争辩和斗争，清楚地暴露了在解决德国问题时存在着两条路线：一条是苏联的路线：它坚决主张按照雅尔塔与波茨坦协议解决德国问题，一条是美国的路线，它企图在解决德国问题时窜改或者背弃雅尔塔与波茨坦协议。在讨论美国所提“德国非军国主义化之四强公约”问题时，两条路线表现得很明白。根据美国的草案，要阻止德国的重新侵略，只要德国“非军国主义化”就够了，不必再要其他；而所谓“非军国主义化”，其精神已不同于波茨坦协议。美国草案实际上是对于波茨坦协议的否定。苏联方面批驳了美国的草案，指出它没有涉及清除纳粹问题，没有强调在德国建立民主秩序，没有用强烈的条款规定撤消公司、托辣斯、卡迭尔、银行等独占企业并使之收归国有，没有规定土地改革，不承认四国共管鲁尔重工业区等等。苏联方面根据波茨坦协议的精神制订了一个完善的草案，其中包括德国的非军国主义化、民主化、完成赔偿义务，四国共管鲁尔，废除德国独占组织以及没收容克贵族的土地等重要原则，这就是著名的“清除德国军国主义并防止德国侵略条约草案”。关于这一问题，莫斯科会议未作决定。莫斯科会议对于最重要的一些问题俱未作出决定。但是，会议在一些次要问题上则取得协议，它通过取消普鲁士邦的决议，对于所谓“外来移民”和德国领士调整问题获得协议，关于遣回德俘问题通过决议，缔结对德和约的程序问题亦获进展。这就是莫斯科会议的概略。
    伦敦会议呢，并不比莫斯科会议开得好。伦敦会议在两个基本问题上未能取得协议：第一是对德和约问题，第二是重建德国统一问题。关于缔结德国和约的意义，苏联代表在会上指出，这将意味着不确定形势的结束以及欧洲完全和平的建立，不仅欧洲而且所有爱好和平的国家都关怀这一问题的解决。苏联代表坚持外长会议应处理这一主要任务。可是，美国代表执拗地进行抵抗，他们企图将整个的对德和约问题完全摈于议事日程之外，他们仅将德国边界问题从完整的问题中提取出来讨论。这样，由于美国的拖延政策，德国和约问题就在外长会议上搁浅了。为什么需要重建德国的统一呢？苏联代表在会上指出，对于德国人民的普遍发展来说，这是至关重要的事；波茨坦会议通过德国民主化与非军国主义化的原则，必须在整个德国实施；德国对于蒙受希特勒侵略及占领国家义务的履行，也依赖于德国统一的重建。苏联代表继而指出，没有德国人民民主力量的积极参加，在民主与和平基础上重建德国的统一是不可能的。因此，苏联代表团建议按照波茨坦协议着手组织德国中央政府。在实际步骤上，苏联建议波茨坦会议关于成立财政、运输、交通、对外贸易、工业、农业与粮食各中央机构的决定应予实施，认为这是走向成立德国中央政府的第一步。苏联又建议在柏林组成由各省代表、全德国各民主政党代表以及自由职工会与其他重要反纳粹团体代表组成之德国咨询委员会。成立德国中央政府、各中央经济机构与柏林咨询委员会，是在德国人民民主力量积极参加下重建德国统一的有效途径。可是，苏联的这一建议受到美英法代表的拒绝。关于这一问题，美英法代表在伦敦会议上也提出了自己的建议，他们以防止中央集权的德意志帝国的恢复为借口，不惜违反现代民主国家的发展过程，企图把德国倒推回去，主张所谓“一切权力归于州”（或者叫做“德国联邦化”），只有某些次要职权划归德国各中央机构。这一计划的目的在于分裂德国，摧毁独立的统一的德国。而这一违反波茨坦协议的政策，自一九四六年以来已在德国西部占领区实际执行中。这样，伦敦会议就失败了。
    过去几次讨论德国问题的外长会议的情形就是如此。
    从这几次外长会议中可以看出一些什么问题呢？
    第一、关于德国问题，外长会议在一些次要方面曾经取得协议，在重要方面则完全没有取得协议。
    第二、从外长会议的分歧中可以看出：有两条不同的路线：一边是苏联，它要求民主的和平，要求在解决德国问题时实施雅尔塔与波茨坦协议。一边是美英法集团，他们要求帝国主义的和平，要求在解决德国问题时背弃雅尔塔与波茨坦协议。
    第三、外长会议之所以开得不好，应该由美国统治集团的政策负责。美国的政策是分裂德国，分裂欧洲，准备新的世界战争。
    第四、在新的外长会议中，只要大家按照共同签字的雅尔塔、波茨坦协议行事，那么，德国问题还是有着正确解决的可能，这已经为过去外长会议中能够取得协议的经验所证明。（附图片）
