    National Youth Congress Day 3
    Yan Jici and Wu Han Give Reports
    Must Specialize in One Field, Serve the People
    [Our Newspaper] The first representative conference of the All-China Youth was held yesterday for the third day. The conference began with a report by physicist Yan Jici on "Youth and Science." The report first pointed out that science must be combined with the people and must be held in the hands of the people. In China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, scientific workers were divorced from the working people, thinking that they were a supra-class third type of person, and therefore selfish and obstructing the development of science, and even being used by imperialism. In the past, scientific workers in old China had the following biases: (1) Due to the different countries where they studied, many factions were formed, which were used by the rulers, affecting cooperation; (2) Not serving the Chinese people, but facing imperialism, willing to be vassals of capitalism; (3) Although subjectively simple and kind, objectively they were high above, far from reality, making science divorced from the people and becoming a stereotyped style of writing that bound the people's minds. The report also pointed out that China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society restricted the development of science. Landlords, bureaucrats, and compradores did not want science. Despite this, science still made considerable achievements during the Anti-Japanese War, especially in the past three years of the People's Liberation War, scientific workers in the liberated areas have made considerable contributions to supplying the front lines and serving the rear. This latent power will be the core of future scientific development. The New Democratic society wants to establish the people's own science, not to be an appendage of imperialist countries; the new science is not a point-and-surface development but a three-dimensional one. In coordination and connection, the backward agricultural country will be transformed into an advanced industrial country. On the one hand, it will be improved, and on the other hand, it will be popularized. The latter is the anti-superstition movement, and the former is to connect industrial and agricultural production with the people's welfare. Finally, he offered advice to young scientific workers: A young person with scientific knowledge or technology must thoroughly understand the actual situation of the society in which he lives, participate in and mobilize the broad masses to participate in this New Democratic social construction movement, and must specialize in one field to serve the people.
    Professor Wu Han, one of the members of the presidium of the conference, reported on youth and culture, pointing out that the thirty years since the May Fourth Movement have been a history of New Democratic revolution. The Chinese Communist Party, which leads the New Democracy, has not only won victories in military and political affairs, but also, due to the leadership of Marxism-Leninism, with Mao Zedong Thought as its concentrated expression, has also won victories on the cultural front. He pointed out that in contemporary Chinese philosophy, politics, economics, military affairs, and literary thought, the ideas of works such as "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," "On Protracted War," "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," "Rectifying the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" are profound and have an incomparable impact. All those who have made real achievements in literature and art have grown up under the direct leadership and indirect influence of People's Democracy. The literary and art workers in the liberated areas have further integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, "Li Youcai Rhymes," "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," and "The White-Haired Girl" are all welcomed by the broad masses. The literary and artistic movement in the liberated areas is very widespread and deep. For example, in the former Jin-Cha-Ji area alone, there were about 3,000 rural drama troupes. In education, the New Democratic education policy was implemented. Students from poor and middle peasant families accounted for the vast majority. Every village had blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts. In the cities, efforts are being made to run mass education centers and literacy classes. The People's Liberation Army is a university. Li Wenbo, a battalion commander under General Liu Bocheng, did not know many characters in the past, but later became a writer. In addition, newspapers and radio stations in the liberated areas are very developed. Natural science research in the liberated areas is closely integrated with agricultural and industrial production. Medical and health workers have done a serious job in epidemic prevention in the absence of equipment and medicines.
    Professor Wu Han emphasized that in order to establish a New Democratic culture, all anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist ideological factions should establish an ideological united front. In this ideological united front, the scientific thought of Marxism-Leninism occupies a leading position. It is necessary to absorb a large amount of advanced foreign culture and critically accept the excellent ancient Chinese culture.
  Must Be Determined to Transform Oneself and Establish a New Labor Attitude
    He called on young cultural workers to be determined to transform themselves, establish a new labor attitude, study hard, specialize in a field, and make cultural workers revolve around production work, which is conducive to the restoration and development of production. Finally, he called on the vast number of educated youth to teach in the countryside and work in factories and troops, such as eliminating illiteracy, medical and health work, and various cultural and recreational activities. Short-term training courses should be held to promote technical education, hold roving lectures, regular specialized academic lectures, strengthen the learning of on-the-job cadres, and establish libraries. Youth and cultural workers should strengthen unity, exchange experience, establish cultural and scientific liaison institutions, and establish ties with international cultural youth.
    [Another News] The Youth Congress has successively received congratulatory messages from all parties: including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Inner Mongolia Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the New York Overseas Chinese Youth League. The congratulatory messages unanimously wish the conference success and victory.

    全国青代大会第三日
    严济慈吴晗相继报告
    必须专精一门，为人民服务
    【本报讯】中华全国青年第一次代表大会昨为第三日，大会开始由物理学家严济慈报告“青年与科学”，报告中首先指出科学要与人民结合，要把握在人民手里。在中国这个半封建半殖民地社会中，科学工作者与劳动人民脱节，以为自己是超阶级的第三种人，因而自私自利，阻碍了科学的发展，甚至为帝国主义所利用。过去旧中国科学工作者有下面的偏向：（一）因留学国家的不同形成了很多的宗派，被统治者所利用，影响了合作；（二）不为中国人民服务，脸朝帝国主义，甘为资本主义的附庸；（三）主观上虽然朴实与善良，但客观上却高高在上，远离现实，使科学与人民脱节，成为束缚人民思想的八股。报告又指出中国半封建半殖民地的社会限制了科学的发展，地主官僚买办都不要科学。虽然这样，但在抗战时期，科学仍然有不少建树，尤其是近三年人民解放战争中，解放区的科学工作者对供应前线及服务后方都有相当贡献，这种潜在的力量，将为今后科学发展的核心。新民主主义社会要建立人民自己的科学，不作帝国主义国家附庸；新科学不是点与面的发展而是立体的，在配合与联系下，由落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，一方面提高，一方面普及，后者是破除迷信运动，前者是把工业农业生产与人民福利连接起来。最后向青年科学工作者提供意见：一个具有科学知识或技术的青年，要彻底认识所处社会的实际情形，参加与发动广大的群众来参加这个新民主主义社会建设运动，必须专精一门，为人民服务。
    大会主席团之一的吴晗教授报告青年与文化，指出五四以来的三十年是一部新民主主义的革命史，领导新民主主义的中国共产党，不但在军事上政治上得到了胜利，而且由于得到以毛泽东思想为集中表现的马列主义的领导，在文化战线上也打了胜仗。他指出在中国当代哲学、政治、经济、军事、文艺思想上，“新民主主义论”，“论联合政府”，“论持久战”，“中国革命战争的战略问题”，“整顿学风党风文风”，“在延安文艺座谈会上讲话”等著作的思想深刻，影响广大是无可比拟的。凡是在文学艺术上有真正成就的，都是在人民民主主义的直接领导间接影响下生长起来，而解放区文学艺术工作者，则更进一步与工农兵结合，如“李有才板话”，“王贵与李香香”，“白毛女”等，都为广大群众所欢迎。解放区文艺运动，是很普遍与深入。例如前晋察冀一地，就有农村剧团三千左右。在教育方面，实施了新民主主义教育方针，出身于贫农中农家庭的学生占绝大多数，每村都有黑板报，屋顶广播等。城市中在努力办民众教育馆、识字班。人民解放军就是一个大学校，刘伯承将军部下营长李文波，过去识字不多，后来成为写作者。此外解放区的报纸、广播电台都很发达。自然科学的研究在解放区与农业工业生产紧紧结合着。医药卫生工作者在器械药品缺乏的情况下，防疫工作作得很认真。
    吴晗教授着重指出：为了建立新民主主义的文化，一切反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的思想派别，应当建立思想上的统一战线。在这个思想统一战线中，马克思列宁主义的科学思想，是居于领导的地位的。必须大量吸收外国的进步的文化，并批判地接受中国古代优秀的文化。
  要决心改造自己建立新的劳动态度
    他号召青年文化工作者，要决心改造自己，建立新的劳动态度，努力学习，使学有专长，并且要使文化工作者围绕着生产工作进行，有利于生产的恢复和发展。最后他号召广大知识青年到乡村教学，到工厂部队里做各种工作，如消灭文盲，医药卫生工作以及各种文化娱乐活动。并须举办短期训练班推广技术教育，办巡回演讲，定期性的专门学术讲座，加强在职干部的学习，建立图书馆。青年和文化工作者应加强团结，交换经验、建立起文化科学的连系机构，并和国际文化青年，取得连系。
    【又讯】青代大会陆续收到各方贺电：计有中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团内蒙团委及纽约华侨青年团等单位，贺电中一致祝大会成功与胜利。
