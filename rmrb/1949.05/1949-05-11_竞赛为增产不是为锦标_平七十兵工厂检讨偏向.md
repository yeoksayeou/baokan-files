    Competition is for Increased Production, Not for Championship
    The 70th Arsenal in Pingjin Reviews Its Deviations
    [Reported by this newspaper] The 70th Arsenal launched a temporary production competition between workers in the First and Sixth Workshops at the end of last month. The results were very good; production generally exceeded the usual level by six times, and in some cases by more than eight times. However, due to inadequate preparation, some deviations occurred during the competition. Instead of helping and promoting each other, the workers in the two workshops held narrow, individualistic, heroic ideas of "overwhelming the other side and making them submit." Therefore, they attacked each other and undermined each other's prestige. For example, the Sixth Workshop said that the First Workshop's technology was too bad and far behind. The First Workshop said that some people in the Sixth Workshop had bad backgrounds and unclear origins. When tools malfunctioned, no one would lend them to each other. At the same time, they excessively increased the speed of the machines, even to the point of not eating or urinating, causing damage to both the machines, tools, and the workers' bodies. After reviewing the situation, the factory clarified the following lessons: Before launching a production competition, all preparatory work must be fully done. First, in-depth ideological mobilization and education must be carried out among all employees to make them realize the true meaning of the production competition. For example, there were already some disagreements between the First and Sixth Workshops. Before the competition, only a hasty meeting was held to put forward the slogan "Carry out the competition to increase production," but the problems were not resolved ideologically. Therefore, it quickly deviated from the correct direction. Secondly, all tools, raw materials, and repair personnel related to the competition must be fully prepared to avoid machine failures and insufficient raw materials after the competition starts, which would affect the workers' morale and the progress of the competition. For example, on the first day of the competition, it was discovered that the washing knives used by the Sixth Workshop were made of steel that was too soft to be used, and on the second day, it was discovered that the drill bits used by the Sixth Workshop were of poor quality, causing malfunctions and a four-hour work stoppage. Thirdly, the competing parties must agree on competition rules in advance to avoid unnecessary disputes during the competition. For example, the Sixth Workshop, due to a drill bit malfunction and a four-hour work stoppage, requested that the lost productivity be compensated based on the average productivity rate. The First Workshop firmly disagreed. As a result, the two sides had a big argument. Finally, there must be strong leadership and continuous education. It is inevitable that disputes will arise during the competition, which requires active elements among the workers to grasp the principles and rules of the competition, constantly educate the workers, overcome incorrect ideas, maintain order, and ensure smooth progress. At the same time, problems that arise should be resolved immediately if possible, and should not be delayed; problems that are not easily solved at the moment can be temporarily left unresolved as long as they do not hinder the competition, and should not be forced to be resolved. For example, in the factory's competition, due to weak leadership and the absence of competition rules, every time a problem arose, everyone would quarrel and order could not be maintained. Also, the Sixth Workshop requested that the lost productivity during the work stoppage be compensated, but a hasty decision was made without explaining it to the First Workshop, causing dissatisfaction in the First Workshop, which said that the leadership was biased towards the Sixth Workshop. As a result, they also stopped working in anger for several hours. Another issue is that during the competition, both parties can send representatives to monitor and inspect each other's work to avoid cheating. This method has proven not to affect the unity of the employees and can avoid some unprincipled and unfounded gossip and disputes afterwards.

    竞赛为增产不是为锦标
    平七十兵工厂检讨偏向
    【本报讯】七十兵工厂曾于上月末发动一、六两所工人进行了一次临时生产竞赛结果很好，生产成绩一般超过了平时的六倍，更有超过八倍的。但由于事前未能做好准备工作，所以在竞赛中发生了一些偏向。两所职工在竞赛中，不是互相帮助、推动，而是抱着“压倒对方、使对方服气”的狭隘个人英雄主义思想。因此互相攻击，互相破坏威信。如六所说一所的技术太糟，差得远。一所说六所某些人出身不好，来历不明。在工具发生故障时，谁也不借给谁。同时又过高的开动机器速率，甚至不吃饭、不便溺、使机器工具和工人身体都受到了损失。该厂经过检讨，明确了如下的经验教训：发动生产竞赛前，必须充分做好一切准备工作，首先是从全体职工中进行深入的思想发动，思想教育，使其认识到生产竞赛的真正意义。如一、六两所之间本来就存在着一些意见，而在竞赛前只匆匆的开了一次会，提出“开展竞赛是为了增加生产”的口号，但在思想想上并未解决问题，因此很快的便脱出了正确的方向。其次是一切有关竞赛的工具、原料、修理人员要有充分的准备，以免在竞赛开展后机器发生故障，原料不足，而影响工人情绪与竞赛的进行。如竞赛的第一天，便发现六所的洗刀比一所的洗刀钢质太软，无法使用，到第二天又发现六所用的钻头比一所质量太差，发生故障、停工四小时。再次，竞赛的双方要在事前订好竞赛纪律，以免在竞赛中引起一些无谓的争执。如六所因钻头发生故障而停工四小时，要求按平均生产率补上停工中的成绩分数。一所则坚决不同意。结果双方大闹意见。最后，必须要有坚强的领导，并随时进行教育。在竞赛中发生争论是不可免的，这就需要通过工人中的积极分子掌握竞赛原则与纪律，随时向工人进行教育，克服不正确思想，维持秩序，保证顺利进行。同时对发生的问题，能解决者应立即解决，不要拖延；一时不易解决者，只要不妨碍竞赛，可以暂做悬案，不要勉强解决。如该厂竞赛中因领导力量薄弱，而又无竞赛纪律，结果每发生一个问题，便全体乱吵，秩序无法维持。又如六所要求补上停工时的成绩分数，因未向一所解释，仓促做出决定，引起一所不满，说领导上偏袒六所。因此也赌气停工数小时。另外一个问题，是在竞赛中，双方可互派代表监视与检查对方工作，以免作弊。这种办法，已证明不会影响职工团结，并可避免事后一些无原则无根据的闲话与纠纷。
