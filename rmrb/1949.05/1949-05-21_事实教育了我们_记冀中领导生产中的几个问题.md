Facts Educated Us
——Some Problems in Hebei Central Region's Production Leadership
By our correspondent Zhao Gang

The well-digging, spot-sowing, drought-prevention, and famine-preparation movement in the Hebei Central Region’s Tenth District, under the active leadership of cadres and the efforts of the region's working farmers, has achieved considerable success. However, in the organization of mass mutual aid production, the following problems emerged, providing us with practical education in production leadership:

I. Coercive Orders Met With Mass Opposition

In organizing the masses to carry out well-digging and spot-sowing, serious deviations towards coercive orders occurred in various counties, especially in Yongqing, Gu'an, and Xincheng counties. According to statistics from 170 villages in four districts of Gu'an, only 18 villages truly formed mutual aid groups freely and voluntarily. The rest were organized by coercive orders. In 52 villages in Xincheng's 11th district, three-quarters of the villages formed mutual aid groups based on the self-defense corps, and one-quarter formed groups that appeared to be voluntary but were actually large-scale labor mobilizations. The Xincheng County Committee reported to the district committee that "the phenomenon of forming groups on the spot (at village mass meetings) without adequate deliberation among the masses is universal throughout the county." Even worse, in a few villages in Gu'an and Xincheng, groups were formed according to the old puppet baojia system, with the baojia chiefs becoming the heads of large and small groups. The result of this compulsory group formation and large-scale labor mobilization can be seen from the facts in Erbao Village, Yongqing's First District. When the village began mobilizing the masses to dig wells and spot-sow, it adopted a method of village-wide labor mobilization, forcing the masses to acknowledge the number of cotton plants to be planted at the meeting. Then, starting from the east of the village, they rotated to the north, west, and south, and everyone started working together in the fields. In one day, 73 people only dug pits for four mu (approx. 0.66 acres) and dug a well opening one zhang five chi (approx. 5 meters) in diameter and three chi (approx. 1 meter) deep. The pits that were dug were either the size of a basin or a teacup. The masses reflected, "Just do what they say! We have to obey whatever they tell us to do!" Some said, "This way of doing things won't be good! Even if we plant, I guarantee nothing will come up." Later, after rectification, the masses were allowed to form groups freely, and their enthusiasm gradually increased. A mutual aid group led by the Farmers' Association Director (eight households) spot-sowed eight mu of cotton in one day. Wang Zhenjia's group, with 16 laborers, carried water from two li (approx. 1 km) away and spot-sowed three mu in one day. This proves that if village cadres forcibly order and organize large-scale labor mobilization without the masses' free will, it will inevitably meet with mass opposition, waste manpower, lose time, and the spot-sowing will fail.

II. Not Proceeding From Reality Inevitably Leads to Separation From the Masses

Some cadres, in leading the masses to dig wells and spot-sow, do not proceed from concrete reality. Liu Jin Ge Zhuang in Yongqing has historically grown a lot of potatoes and harvested a great deal. This time, Comrade Ma Zhen, the deputy county chief, went to this village and, without in-depth investigation and understanding, used accounting methods to mobilize the masses to grow more cotton. As a result, the masses calculated that growing cotton would not bring in as much money as growing potatoes, and he ran into a brick wall. The soil in Dama Zi Zhuang in the Eighth District is moist and does not require spot-sowing. However, the district cadre, without understanding the situation or consulting with the masses, subjectively instructed the masses to dig eleven wells for spot-sowing, which was met with mass opposition. Although the above facts are not universal, they illustrate that our cadres, in leading production, have a blind task-oriented view that lacks in-depth investigation and research, which inevitably leads to separation from the masses and affects production.

III. Overcoming Difficulties Can Motivate the Masses

The village cadres of Nan Xiao Cheng Village in Gu'an's Fifth District, in order to break the masses' idea that wells could not be dug in "quicksand" land, first organized themselves to dig wells. When they failed for the first time, they were not discouraged. They found the reasons for the failure, researched and developed improved methods, and continued to dig, finally creating a model for digging wells in "quicksand" land, which motivated the masses of the entire village to dig wells and spot-sow. Comrades Pan Dekun, the district secretary of the Sixth District, and two others personally led seven village cadres to dig a well in order to break the masses' lack of confidence in digging wells and spot-sowing and their reliance on heaven in Bei Huangfa. This broke through the masses' concerns and motivated 105 people (22 groups) to dig wells and spot-sow. On the first day of this month, five wells were dug, and more than 300 mu of cotton were spot-sowed in three days. From the above facts, it shows that in areas without the habit and experience of digging wells and spot-sowing, especially in cases where the masses have a serious reliance on heaven, cadres taking the lead and overcoming difficulties is an extremely important key.

　　事实教育了我们
    ——记冀中领导生产中的几个问题
    本报记者  赵刚
    冀中十分区的打井点种防旱备荒运动，在干部的积极领导，和全区劳动农民的努力之下，已获得相当成绩。但在组织群众互助生产中，出现了以下几个问题，在生产领导上给我们以实际的教育：
    一、强迫命令遭到群众反对
    在组织群众开展打井点种中，各县均发生了强迫命令的严重偏向，永清、固安、新城等县尤其严重。据固安四个区一百七十几个村的统计，除十八个村真正是自由自愿结组互助外，其余均是强迫命令编制起来的。新城十一区五十二个村，四分之三的村是按自卫队编的互助组，四分之一村表面是自由结的组，实际上也是大拨工。新城县委向地委汇报说：“未经群众很好酝酿而当场（村群众大会）编组的村，是全县普遍的现象”。甚而固安、新城少数村庄按过去伪保甲编的组，保甲长当了大小组长。这种强迫编组实行大拨工的结果，从永清一区二堡的事实就可看出。该村开始动员群众打井点种时，采取了全村大拨工的办法，让群众在大会上承认种棉数目字，然后便从村东开始，向北、西、南转着点种，到地里就一齐动手来干。这样干了一天，七十三个人仅挖了四亩的坑，打了一个方圆一丈五、深三尺的井口。挖的坑不是盆子大就是茶碗小。群众反映说：“随着干吧！叫咱们干什么就得服从！”有的说：“这么干没个种好！就是种上保准出不来”。后来经过纠正，让群众自由结组，群众情绪才逐渐提高。农会主任领导的互助组（八户），一天内就点种了八亩棉花，王振甲组十六个劳动力，从二里以外挑水，一天点种了三亩。由此证明，不经群众自由自愿，而由村干强迫命令组织大拨工的，必然遭到群众反对，浪费人力，误工夫，点种就要落空。
    二、不从实际出发必然脱离群众
    有些干部在领导群众打井点种中，不从具体实际出发，永清刘靳各庄历来种土豆很多，并且收获很大。这次该县副县长马珍同志去到此村后，未经深入调查了解，用算帐办法动员群众多种棉花，结果群众一算，种棉还不如种土豆多卖钱，而碰了钉子。八区大麻子庄土地温润，勿须点种。但区干去到此村后，既不了解情况又不和群众很好商量，就主观的让群众打十一眼井进行点种，结果遭到群众的反对。以上事实虽不普遍，但说明了我们的干部，在领导生产中存在着不深入调查研究的盲目的任务观点，必然脱离群众，影响生产。
    三、突破困难就能带动群众
    固安五区南孝城村干为打破群众认为“流砂”地不能打井的思想，他们首先组织起来打井。当第一次失败后，他们并不灰心丧气，找出失败原因，研究出改进办法，继续来打，终于创造了“流砂”地打井的范例，带动了全村群众打井点种。六区区书潘德坤等二同志，为打破北黄垡群众对打井点种无信心的靠天吃饭思想，亲自带动了七个村干打了一眼井。打破了群众顾虑，带动了一百零五人（二十二个组）进行打井点种。在本月一号就打井五眼，三天中点棉三百多亩。从以上事实中，说明了在没打井点种习惯和经验的地区，特别在群众存在着严重靠天吃饭的情况下，干部的以身作则，突破困难，是极其重要的关键。
