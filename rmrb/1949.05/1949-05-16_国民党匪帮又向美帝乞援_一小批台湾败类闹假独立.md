Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th -- The Kuomintang bandit gang and American imperialism are again engaged in various conspiratorial activities. According to Washington sources, Gu Weijun, the Kuomintang bandit gang's "ambassador" to the United States, met with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on the 11th to beg for American aid and secretly discuss the issue of "establishing a Pacific Pact modeled after the Atlantic Pact." After the fake "Acting President" Li Zongren arrived in Guangzhou from Guilin on the 8th of this month, he decided to send Gan Jiehou to the United States as a fake foreign ministry advisor to beg for aid. The bandit gang has also sent Zhu Shiming to replace Shang Zhen as the head of the delegation to Japan to strengthen relations with MacArthur. The U.S. government gifted four warships to the Kuomintang bandit gang. Following the Taihe and Taicang ships, the Taihu and Taizhao ships arrived in Taiwan on the 11th. The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China branch has fled from Shanghai to Guangzhou, and its director, Lapham, flew to Taiwan on the 11th to confer with the bandit leader Chen Cheng. Under the instigation of the American masters, the so-called "Taiwan independence" movement of a small group of Taiwanese scoundrels is continuing.

　　国民党匪帮又向美帝乞援
  　一小批台湾败类闹假独立
    【新华社北平十四日电】国民党匪帮与美帝国主义间又在进行种种阴谋活动。据华盛顿消息披露，国民党匪帮驻美“大使”顾维钧十一日会见美国务卿艾奇逊，乞求美国援助，并秘密商谈“仿照大西洋公约建立太平洋公约”的问题。伪“代总统”李宗仁本月八日由桂林到广州后，已决定派甘介侯以伪外交部顾问的名义赴美乞援，匪帮并已派朱世明代商震为驻日代表团长，以加强与麦克阿瑟的关系。美国政府赠送国民党匪帮军舰四艘，继太和、太仓两舰之后，又有太湖、太昭两舰于十一日驶抵台湾。美经合总署中国分署已由上海逃往广州，该署署长莱普汉又于十一日飞往台湾与匪首陈诚会商。在美国主子的策动下，一小批台湾败类的所谓“台湾独立”运动正在继续进行。
