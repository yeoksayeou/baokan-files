　　Moscow dispatch: An observer in Izvestia recently authored an article summarizing the achievements of the second session of the Third United Nations General Assembly and analyzing the struggle between forces attempting to undermine and destroy the United Nations and forces striving to consolidate and expand it.

　　The observer writes that one cannot help but recall that the infamous North Atlantic Treaty was signed just one day before the opening of the UN General Assembly session in New York. This was no coincidence. The organizers of this aggressive military-political alliance—the leaders of the US-British bloc—deliberately arranged the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty on the eve of the resumption of the General Assembly as a provocation against the United Nations. However, the aggressive bloc's desire to bury the United Nations was resisted by peace-loving people, who established the United Nations organization to defend and maintain peace and universal security. The pessimistic predictions of imperialist propaganda to greet the United Nations New York meeting did not achieve their purpose, and they could not shake the Soviet Union's determination to support the principles of the United Nations in the slightest.

　　The observer points out that in the course of the New York General Assembly's work, the US-British delegations arranged irrelevant issues such as the "Mindszenty case" on the agenda, attempting to use the General Assembly as a cover for their interference in the internal affairs of other countries, thereby crudely undermining the United Nations Charter. The US-British bloc continued their policy of undermining the United Nations, forcing the General Assembly to accept decisions aimed at opposing the principle of unanimity among the major powers. As a result of the colonial countries' conspiracy, the discussion on the Indonesian question was obstructed. The observer emphasizes that in order to achieve their goals, the US-British bloc exerted unprecedented pressure on the representatives of several countries. However, this pressure did not produce the results desired by the US-British bloc in several cases, which is a significant achievement of the Third UN General Assembly in New York.

　　The observer emphasizes when discussing the General Assembly's discussion of the principle of unanimity among the major powers in the Security Council: The Soviet delegation, with the support of the people's democratic countries, pointed out that the attack on the principle of unanimity among the major powers is directly related to the US-British aggressive policy, which is most prominently manifested in the North Atlantic Treaty. And the US-British bloc's renewed attack on the principle of unanimity among the major powers proved to be a self-defeating action. The enemies of the principle of unanimity among the major powers, once exposed to world public opinion, found themselves in a situation like criminals caught in the act.

　　The observer further points out that Franco's US-British benefactors, through the representatives of their vassals Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, proposed a motion aimed at abolishing the United Nations' resolutions condemning Franco's Spanish fascist regime for endangering peace and security and ordering all member states to withdraw their diplomatic envoys stationed in Madrid. This proposal was defeated. The United Nations General Assembly decided that those two resolutions remain valid. The observer points out that because the Soviet delegation exposed to the whole world the policy of helping and encouraging the Spanish fascist regime carried out by the US-British reactionaries, who are turning the Iberian Peninsula into their military base, the United States, although abstaining in the vote on the four-nation delegation's proposal on Spain, cannot deceive any country. The attempt to force the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the plan proposed by the US-British based on the military strategic interests of the United States and the North Atlantic Alliance to divide the Italian colonies also failed in the same way. The fair principles held by the Soviet Union in its proposal on the Italian colonial issue were supported by the delegations of countries neighboring the Italian colonies, and also by countries that fully understand the suffering of colonial oppression based on their own experience.

　　The observer then discusses the General Assembly's discussion of the draft convention on "Freedom of Information and News Transmission." The Soviet representative convincingly pointed out that the slogan of "freedom of the press" has been used as a cover for carrying out anti-democratic, anti-peace, and anti-international cooperation struggles. Although the draft convention on "International Transmission of News and News Correction" has been adopted by the General Assembly under US-British pressure, United Nations personnel pointed out that because this convention is aimed at opposing the domestic newspapers and radio stations of small countries and can be used to allow US propaganda to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, many countries will refuse to sign and ratify this convention.

　　The observer concludes by saying that the sentiment of the masses of people, vividly expressed by the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, has influenced the work of the Third Second Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The achievements of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York strengthen the confidence of all peace fighters that the Soviet Union's struggle against undermining and destroying the United Nations and consolidating its authority has borne fruit.

### 消息报观察家著文　评本届联大的成就与斗争

  　评本届联大的成就与斗争
    【新华社北平二十五日电】莫斯科讯：消息报观察家顷著文总结联合国第三届第二次大会的成就，并分析在设法破坏与摧毁联合国的力量及努力巩固与扩大联合国的力量之间的斗争。
    观察家写道，人们不能不回忆到，就在联大纽约会议开幕的前一天，签订了声名狼籍的北大西洋公约。这并不是一个偶合。这个侵略的军事政治联盟的组织者--美英集团的领袖们，故意在大会复会的前夕，安排下签订北大西洋公约的仪式，作为向联合国的挑衅。可是，侵略集团埋葬联合国的愿望，遭到爱好和平人们的抗击，后者是为了保卫及维持和平与普遍安全而成立联合国组织。帝国主义的宣传用以迎接联合国纽约会议的悲观预言，并未达到他们的目的，它们丝毫不能动摇苏联支持联合国原则的决心。
    观察家指出：在纽约大会进行工作的过程中，美英代表团在议程中安排上象“明曾蒂案”之类毫不相干的问题，力图利用联大作为他们干涉他国内政的掩盖物，从而粗暴地破坏联合国宪章。美英集团继续他们破坏联合国的政策，强使大会接受旨在反对大国一致原则的决定。由于殖民国家的阴谋诡计的结果，关于印尼问题的讨论横遭阻挠。观察家着重指出：美英集团为了达到他们的目的起见，对若干国家的代表施以空前的压力。可是，这种压力在若干案件上并没有产生象美英集团所愿望的那种结果，这是第三届联大纽约会议的显著成就。
    观察家论及大会关于安理会中大国一致原则的讨论时着重指出：获得人民民主国家支持的苏联代表团指明：对于大国一致原则的攻击，是和极显著地表现在北大西洋公约上的美英侵略政策直接联系着的。而美英集团对于大国一致原则的再次进攻，证明是害人自害的事情。大国一致原则的敌人，一经暴露在世界公众的面前，就发现他他们自己的处境有如当场被捉获的罪犯。
    观察家进而指出：佛朗哥的美英恩主，通过他们的附庸巴西、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚和秘鲁等四国的代表，提出旨在废除联合国斥责佛朗哥西班牙法西斯政权危害和平与安全及通令所有会员国撤回驻马德里外交使节两项决议的议案。这项提案遭到了失败。联合国大会决定那两项决议继续有效。观察家指出：因为苏联代表团在全世界面前揭露正在变伊比利安半岛为其军事基地的美英反动派所举行的帮助与鼓励西班牙法西斯政权的政策，美国在表决四国代表团关于西班牙的提案时，虽然弃权，也欺骗不了任何一个国家。强使联合国大会通过美英基于美国与北大西洋联盟军事战略利益而提出的分割意大利殖民地的计划的企图，也是同样地失败了。苏联于意大利殖民地问题的建议中所持的公平原则，受到邻近意大利殖民地国家的代表团的支持，也受到根据它们自己的经验充分了解殖民地压迫之苦的国家的支持。
    观察家继而论列大会关于“新闻自由与新闻传播”公约草案的讨论。苏联代表令人信服地指明：“新闻自由”的口号，已被用作进行反民主、反和平、反国际合作斗争的掩护。虽然“国际传播新闻与新闻更正”公约草案在美英压力下已被大会通过，但是，联合国人士指出：因为这一公约旨在反对小国本国的报纸与电台，并且能够被利用以便美国的宣传干涉这些国家的内政，因此，许多国家都将拒绝签署与批准这个公约。
    观察家结语称：为世界拥护和平大会所生动表现的人民大众的情绪，对于联合国第三届第二次大会的工作发生了影响。联大纽约会议的成就，加强着一切和平战士的信心，即苏联反对破坏与摧毁联合国及巩固它的权威的斗争获得了果实。
