　　Inspect Leadership, Rectify Discipline:
  　Gaocheng Mobilizes All Efforts to Lead Sowing
    [News from Jizhong] The Gaocheng County Party Committee strictly inspected the production leadership of districts and villages, strengthened the discipline of cadres, and concentrated its efforts to go to the countryside to lead farmers in a blitz sowing. By the first half of April, the county had organized the masses to eliminate insect pests in 32 villages, watered more than 54,000 mu of wheat fields, and sown more than 12,000 mu of early-maturing crops. However, the County Party Committee was not paralyzed by these production achievements. Facing the urgent juncture of the sowing season, in order to ensure the realization of the planting plan, it specially convened an enlarged meeting of county, district, and key village cadres on April 20 to deeply inspect leadership and rectify discipline. It was discovered that some district cadres left their posts at will to go home, were not active in their work, and even disobeyed leadership, which had affected the completion of the sowing task. For example, in the First District, by April 18, no one had taken care of the production of ten villages including Chen Village at all. In eight villages including Ma Village, only three village cadre meetings were held to talk about it. In four villages including Guo Village, which were better, only four meetings were held, including village cadre, party member, and mass meetings. It was thought that the meetings were very enthusiastic and the work was done well, but there was no follow-up to see if the plan could be completed. The reason for this phenomenon was partly due to objective reasons such as district cadres supporting the front, receiving training, and repairing dikes; but the main reason was the lack of organization and discipline among cadres. For example, in addition to the cook, the communications staff, and the cadres supporting the front, the district had fifteen cadres left. Among these cadres, four asked for leave to go home under various pretexts, three were sick (two were faking it), and five cadres stayed in the office for a long time without going to the countryside. Only three cadres went to the countryside to lead one neighborhood each, but these three cadres were also mentally distressed because the district committee's "rewards and punishments for cadres were unclear." Around April 18, they were transferred to do other work, so the entire district's production sowing was abandoned. Although the district committee intended to correct this phenomenon, it yielded when faced with the resistance of cadres who had made mistakes, and did not dare to uphold the truth and carry out rectification. This phenomenon has become the main danger that could lead to the failure of the sowing plan. At the cadre meeting, the County Party Committee first made a self-criticism and educated the cadres, so that everyone realized the seriousness of these mistakes. Wei Chenrong, assistant of the First District Education, said, "When I review myself, I really hate myself..." Many cadres unanimously stated: "This time my mind is clear, I will definitely do a good job when I go back!" Anxin, a cadre of the Sixth District, proposed to everyone: "I guarantee that I will not go home until the sowing task is completed!" All the cadres unanimously stated: "During the sowing period, we will resolutely not ask for leave and will go all out to lead the farmers to complete the sowing plan." After the meeting, the county-level organs immediately organized joint offices, with one person doing the work of three. Thirty-two people were drawn from various departments to go to the countryside to specifically help districts and villages solve difficulties and complete the sowing plan.

　　检查领导整顿纪律
  　藁城动员全力领导播种
    【冀中讯】藁城县委严格检查区村生产领导，加强干部的纪律性，集中力量下乡领导农民突击播种。该县到四月上半月即组织群众扑灭三十二个村虫灾，浇麦田五万四千余亩，播种早熟作物一万二千余亩。但县委没有为这些生产成绩麻痹了自己，在面临着播种季节的紧急关头，为保证种植计划的实现，特于四月二十日召集了县、区干部及重点村村干部扩大会议，深入检查领导、整顿纪律。发现有些区干部随便离职回家，工作不积极，甚至不服从领导，已影响到播种任务的完成。例如一区到四月十八日还有陈村等十个村的生产根本没有人去管过，马村等八个村只召开了三次村干部会说了一下，郭庄等四个村较好也只开了村干、党员、群众大会等四次会议。以为会开的很热烈工作是办好了，以后也没有过问，是否能完成计划感到没有把握。造成此种现象虽有其客观原因如区干部支援前线、受训、修堤等工作繁忙；但主要的是干部的无组织无纪律所致。如该区除火夫、通讯员及支前干部外，还剩十五个干部，这些干部中有四个托词请假回家，三个闹病（两个是装病），五个干部长留机关不下乡，只有三个干部分头下乡，一个人领导一个小区，但这三个干部也因区委对干部“赏罚不明”而精神苦恼，到四月十八左右又调他三个去做别的工作，于是全区生产播种就形成放弃领导状态。委区对此种现象虽打算纠正，但遇到犯错误干部的抵抗，即随之迁就下去，不敢坚持真理进行整顿。此种现象已成为使播种计划破产的主要危险。县委在干部大会上首先做了检讨，教育了干部，使大家均认识了这些种错误的严重性，一区教育助理员魏臣荣说：“检讨起来真痛恨自己……”许多干部一致表示：“这次清楚了脑筋，回去一定好好干工作！”六区干部安心向大家提出：“我保证不完成播种任务不回家！”全体干部一致表示：“播种期间坚决不请假，全力去领导农民完成播种计划。”会后县级机关即组织联合办公，三人的工作一人做，又从各部门抽出三十二人，下乡具体帮助区、村解决困难，完成播种计划。
