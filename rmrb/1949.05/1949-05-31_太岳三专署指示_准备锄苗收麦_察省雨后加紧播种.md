　　Taiyue Third Administrative Office Directs
  　Prepare for Weeding and Wheat Harvesting
  　Chahar Province Intensifies Sowing After Rain
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Taiyue Third Administrative Office (administering Jin City, Gaoping, Meng County, Jiyuan, Yuanqu and other five counties) issued a directive to all counties on May 12, pointing out that the current spring plowing and sowing work is nearing completion. We should seize the time to rectify mutual aid teams, prepare for weeding, and harvest wheat to ensure the completion of the task of increasing production by 10%. Before weeding and wheat harvesting, the following preparations must be made: (1) Agricultural tools such as hoes, sickles, plows, and drills should be checked as soon as possible. Broken ones should be repaired, and insufficient ones should be supplemented to avoid being rushed when the time comes. (2) Topdressing for corn and millet fields, and fertilizer for stubble fields must be prepared early. (3) Prepare necessities such as fuel, oil, and salt to avoid wasting time during busy periods.
    [Chahar News] It has rained thoroughly in various parts of Chahar Province, and various places are working intensely on plowing and sowing. The Yishui Prefectural Committee immediately issued an emergency directive after the rain: (1) Determine that the current central task is to rush plowing and sowing, and stop all non-urgent matters and service mobilizations, and concentrate on plowing and sowing in a fighting posture. (2) All organs, troops, organizations, schools, and stores should extract as much manpower and animal power as possible during off-hours to help local people (especially families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres) with the crash plowing and sowing. The Prefectural Committee has also extracted more than 50 cadres, and sent them to Wan, Tang, Wang, Man, Xu and other counties to lead the masses in crash plowing and sowing. The Nankou Sub-district Committee immediately notified all counties to mobilize and organize all cadres to go to the countryside to lead the masses in crash plowing and sowing. It is forbidden to convene all unnecessary meetings and service mobilizations. The Jingxing County Committee convened an emergency meeting when the heavy rain first fell. It was decided to complete the sowing of autumn crops within five days.
