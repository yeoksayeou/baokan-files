    The Two Basic Slogans of the May Fourth Movement
    He Ganzhi
    The May Fourth era had two basic slogans, representing the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement, namely democracy and science. However, within the united front, there were representatives of various classes, especially the representatives of the working class and the bourgeoisie. Due to the different demands of the classes, although within the same front, they had different requirements for these two basic slogans.
    First, democracy. There are various kinds of democracy. There are American and European-style democratic republics led by the bourgeoisie, and there are people's democratic republics led by the working class. These are democracies required by different classes. In the early Republic of China, there was a Provisional Constitution, which was an imitation of the European and American democratic systems. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was a debate in the Beijing government about the cabinet system and the presidential system. This was a question of whether the central government should follow the American presidential system or the French cabinet system. This debate ended with Yuan Shikai's dissolution of the parliament. In the Sixth Year of the Republic of China, the Constitutional Protection Movement saw China split into two governments. The Beijing government was manipulated and controlled by the remnants of the Northern Warlords and was a reactionary regime. In Guangdong, the Guangdong-Guangxi warlords were rampant, and Sun Yat-sen was excluded from the military government. As for the law Sun Yat-sen was protecting, it was also the Provisional Constitution of the early Republic. By the May Fourth era, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the "Construction" magazine in Shanghai. They believed that revolutionary construction could begin without revolutionary destruction, which shows that the leaders of the Kuomintang at that time had a wrong view of the issue of national construction. Soon after, Hu Shi and others put forward the signboard of a good government, vainly trying to win over a few so-called good people and so-called first-class talents in their imagination under the rule of the warlords to form a cabinet. This was democracy. In short, whether it was the Provisional Constitution of the early Republic, the American or French-style government, or a good government, they were all bourgeois regimes, or joint regimes of the bourgeoisie and the feudal class, and were required by the Chinese bourgeoisie.
    As for the working class, represented by the communist Li Dazhao at that time, they issued the call of "The Victory of the Common People" and "The Victory of Bolshevism." In our current parlance, this call meant the victory of the working-class revolution and the victory of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, when the Allied Powers won the war and the whole country celebrated, shouting that justice had triumphed over might, he specifically said that it was the victory of the working-class revolution. After the Russian Revolution, some malicious propagandists said that it was the "radical party" rebelling in Russia; some commentators said that it was the victory of democracy over autocracy, but he specifically said that it was the victory of Marxism-Leninism. At that time, there was also a debate about "problems and isms." Seeing the gradual prevalence of Marxist doctrines, Hu Shi and his like hurriedly shouted that they should study more problems and talk less about isms. Of course, it is necessary to study practical problems, but only Marxism can solve China's practical problems. Hu Shi and his like used it as a shield to prevent the growth of Marxism-Leninism in China, which represented the bourgeoisie's resistance to the revolutionary leadership of the working class. Li Dazhao's proposition was already a scientific prediction. The Chinese revolution must be led by the working class and armed with Marxism-Leninism in order to achieve victory. Isn't this a fact that has already been proven?
    Second, science, that is, scientific thought. Also, because the May Fourth Movement was a united front of all classes, there were also various philosophies that appeared in China at the same time.
    Hu Shi first advocated Dewey's pragmatism, as well as the idealism of Russell, Driesch, and Bergson. Needless to say, various forms of idealism are anti-scientific, and pragmatism, which was more popular at the time, was essentially mechanism, and when it touched on social issues, it was idealism. After the May Fourth Movement, there was a major debate in Chinese intellectual circles, namely the debate on science and outlook on life. The theme of the debate was whether science could dominate the outlook on life. Zhang Junmai and his like took the outlook on life as subjective and intuitive, which was of course extreme idealism, and Ding Wenjiang and others also admitted that there are phenomena that science cannot explain, and we can only remain skeptical, and they called themselves skeptical idealists. He obviously confused the questions about the unknowable in the universe that science has not yet solved with the question of whether science can solve the problems of the universe and society, and was actually an agnostic. When Hu Shi later commented on this debate, he came up with his bald-headed view of history, that is, he regarded the roles of economic, political, ideological, moral, cultural, and educational elements as equally important, all equally influencing and dominating the outlook on life, without the distinction between primary and secondary, which was essentially idealism. The root of the problem in the thinking of these people is that they only see some phenomena and do not know how to see the essence in the dazzling phenomena, and even deliberately deny facts and fabricate history. For example, Hu Shi talked nonsense that five ghosts, such as poverty, disease, and ignorance, were disturbing China, but feudal forces and imperialism were not included. Since the objects of the Chinese revolution were not feudalism and imperialism, Hu Shi became a defender of counter-revolution and even a member of the counter-revolution.
    Li Dazhao was the first to promote dialectics and materialism in the May Fourth era. His early writings, "Youth" and "Now," are monuments to the enlightenment of Marxism. As early as thirty-five years ago, Li Dazhao clearly pointed out that youth is evolutionary and developing, without beginning or end, without limit or pole, and youth is endless, so China's progress should also be endless. "Now" means the present. History is passed down to each other. So, the present is a historical process. From yesterday to today, and from today to tomorrow. However, the present is our starting point, because today has the role of carrying forward the past and opening up the future for yesterday and tomorrow, so we must take the present as the foothold and move forward.
    This is how the communists in the May Fourth era used Marx's view of contradiction and development to praise the new life of China. This is a fighting outlook on life and a revolutionary philosophy.
    The May Fourth Movement has reached its thirtieth anniversary. In these thirty years, Beijing, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, has been liberated, and the Chinese revolution is moving towards a nationwide victory. This is the continuation and development of the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement. As early as 1913, Lenin predicted: "No matter what the fate of the great Republic of China, which those civilized jackals are sharpening their teeth to devour, there is no force in the world that can restore the old serf system in Asia, or eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of people in Asian and semi-Asian countries." However, the abolition of the Chinese serf system and the awakening of the people's democratic spirit can only be realized under the leadership of the Chinese working class, because the revolutions in Asian countries show us the same cowardice and meanness of the liberals, the same particularly great significance of the independence of the democratic masses, and the same division of the proletariat from any bourgeoisie." ("The Historical Destiny of Marxist Doctrine") This division of the proletariat from any bourgeoisie lies in the fact that all historical facts prove the bankruptcy of various forms of idealism and mechanism, the bankruptcy of various forms of bourgeois reformism, and also prove that only the leadership of the working class and its party armed with Marxism-Leninism can enable the Chinese people to completely embark on the road of democratic revolution.

    五四的两个基本口号
    何干之
    五四时代有两个基本口号，代表五四的革命精神，即民主与科学。然而在联合战线内有各个阶级的代表，尤其工人阶级与资产阶级的代表，由于阶级的要求不同，虽则在同一战线内，而对于这两个基本口号，也有不同的要求。
    第一、民主。有各种不同的民主。有由资产阶级所领导的欧美式的民主共和国，也有由工人阶级所领导的人民民主共和国。这是不同的阶级所要求的民主。民元，中国有一个约法，这是欧美民主制度的模仿。民初北京政府有关于内阁制和总统制的争论，这是中央政府要以美国的总统制为法还是以法国的内阁制为法的问题，这一次的争论，是以袁世凯的解散国会而收场了。民六护法战争，中国分裂为两个政府，北京政府为北洋军阀余孽所操纵把持，是反动的政权。而在广东，粤桂军阀横行，孙中山在军政府里是被排斥的；至于孙中山所护之法，也是民元的约法。到五四时代，孙中山等在上海创办“建设”杂志，他们相信不经过革命的破坏，而可以着手革命的建设，可见那时国民党的领导者对于建国问题的看法是错误的。不久，胡适等又捧出好人政府的招牌，妄想在军阀统治下拉拢几个他们意想中的所谓好人，所谓第一流人才，来组织内阁，这就是民主。总之民元约法也好，美国式或法国式的政府也好，好人政府也好，都是资产阶级的政权，或是资产阶级与封建阶级相勾结的联合政权，而为中国资产阶级所要求的。
    至于工人阶级方面，那时以共产主义者李大钊为代表，而发出了“庶民的胜利”和“布尔塞维克的胜利”的呼声，这呼声，用我们现在的惯用语来说，即是工人阶级革命的胜利，是马列主义的胜利。所以当协约国胜利之后，举国同庆，喊着公理战胜强权的时候，他确切地说这是工人阶级革命的胜利。俄国革命之后，有些恶意的宣传家说这是“过激党”在俄国的造反；有的评论家又说这是民主主义战胜专制主义，而他则确切地说这是马列主义的胜利。那时还有过关于“问题与主义”的争论。胡适辈目击着马克思学说的逐渐盛行，而急忙地叫喊要多研究问题少谈些主义。当然必须研究实际问题，但是只有马克思主义才能够解决中国的实际问题。而胡适辈却把它当作盾牌，来阻止马克思列宁主义在中国的成长，是表示资产阶级对于工人阶级的革命领导权的抗拒。李大钊的主张，早已是科学的预言了。中国革命必须由工人阶级来领导而又为马列主义所武装才能够获得胜利，这不是早已被证明的事实么？
    第二、科学，即科学思想。也由于五四运动是各阶级的联合，所以同时出现于中国的也有各种各样的哲学。
    胡适首先提倡杜威的实验主义，还有罗素、杜里舒、柏格森的唯心主义等。各种唯心主义不用说是反科学的，而当时流行较广的实验主义，实质上是机械主义，一触到社会问题，则是唯心主义。五四之后，中国思想界曾经有过一场大的论辩，即关于科学与人生观的论辩。争论的主题是关于科学能不能支配人生观的问题。张君劢辈以人生观为主观的，直觉的，固然是极端的唯心主义，而丁文江等也承认有的现象，科学所不能解释的，我们只好存疑，并自号为存疑的唯心论。他显然地是把科学至今尚未解决的关于宇宙间的不可知的问题和科学能不能解决宇宙问题及社会问题，混为一谈，实际上是不可知论者。而胡适后来评论这一场论争的时候，却又拿出他的秃头的历史观，即把经济、政治、思想、道德、文化、教育等要素的作用，等量齐观，都同样的影响着支配着人生观，而并没有第一性和第二性的区别，实质上是唯心主义者。这些人思想中的病根是只见一些现象而不知在万花缭乱的现象中看本质，甚至于有意否认事实，捏造历史。例如胡适妄谈贫穷、疾病、愚昧等五个鬼扰乱着中华，而封建势力不在内，帝国主义也不在内。中国革命的对象既然不是封建主义与帝国主义，那么胡适就变了反革命的辩护人，以至成为反革命中的一分子。
    五四时代最先宣传辩证法与唯物论的是李大钊。他早年所写的“青春”和“今”，是马克思主义启蒙的纪念碑。李大钊早在三十五年前就清醒地指出青春是进化发展的，无始无终的，无限无极的，青春是无穷无尽的，所以中国的进步也应是无穷尽的。“今”即现在。历史互相递禅。所以现在是一个历史过程。由昨日到今日，又由今日到明日。然而现在则是我们的出发点，因为今日对于昨日和明日有承前启后的作用，所以我们必须以现在为立脚点推向前进。
    这是五四时代的共产主义者用马克思的矛盾观发展观来歌颂中国的新生，这是战斗的人生观，革命的哲学。
    五四已到它三十年的纪念。这三十年中，五四的发祥地北平已经解放，中国革命正走向全国的胜利，这是五四革命精神的继续与发展。列宁早在一九一三年就预言：“不管那些文明豺狼磨牙欲噬的伟大中华民国命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除亚洲国家和半亚洲国家里人民大众底英勇民主精神。”然而废除中国农奴制度以及唤醒人民民主精神只有在中国工人阶级的领导下才能实现的，因为亚洲各国革命向我们显示出来的，同样是自由派底懦怯卑鄙的劣根性，同样是民主群众独立性所具有的特别巨大意义，同样是无产阶级与任何资产阶级的分野。”（“马克思学说底历史命运”）这无产阶级与任何资产阶级的分野，就在于一切历史事实都证明各种形式的唯心主义及机械主义的破产，各种形式资产阶级改良主义的破产，也都证明只有为马列主义所武装的工人阶级及其政党的领导才能够使中国人民彻底走民主革命的道路。
