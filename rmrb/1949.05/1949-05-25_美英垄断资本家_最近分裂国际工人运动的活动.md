    Activities of US and British Monopoly Capitalists in Splitting the International Workers' Movement Recently

    After the agents of US and British monopoly capitalists in trade unions, namely the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the United States, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Britain, and the General Confederation of Labor in the Netherlands, attempted to sabotage the international unity of the working class by withdrawing from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in January and failed, they are now continuing to actively carry out splitting activities, including splitting the Asian workers' movement. The American Federation of Labor (AFL), the tool of US monopoly capital for splitting the workers' movement, wants to organize a so-called "Asian Labor Federation" in Asia, in the same way it organized the "Pan-American Labor Confederation" in Latin America and the "Trade Union Advisory Committee" in Europe, which are in favor of US monopoly capital, and make trade unions in various Asian countries withdraw from the WFTU, in order to attack this genuine workers' organization that fights for the interests of the workers. For this purpose, under the instigation of the AFL, the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), a semi-official organization established by the Indian ruling class the year before last to counter the All India Trade Union Congress, initiated a preparatory committee for the "Asian Labor Federation," which was scheduled to be held in Indore, India, from May 6th to 8th. Before the meeting, trade unions from India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Ceylon, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Australia, and other countries were invited to send representatives to attend. However, only two Iranian representatives and three West Pakistani representatives arrived in India. Those who participated in the Indian National Trade Union Congress, which was held at the same time as this meeting, had to admit that representatives from other countries could not come to Indore due to the strong opposition of organized workers to the splitting plan. Therefore, the meeting was not held. In order to cover up their failure and continue their splitting conspiracy, it was decided to hold a meeting in Geneva on the 26th, where representatives of "trade unions" from Asian countries would discuss the possibility of establishing an "Asian Labor Federation." However, it can be predicted that this meeting will not have a more solid foundation than the meeting in Indore.
    The AFL leadership has decided to set up offices in Bombay and Tokyo in order to plan splitting activities against Asian workers' solidarity. Brown, the AFL representative who is carrying out splitting activities in Europe, has moved his office from Paris to Bombay. At the same time, in coordination with the splitting activities in Asia, American and British labor traitors have been oppressing and influencing the senior leadership of the trade unions in New Zealand, Denmark, and Sweden, making decisions to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has also stated that he will follow the wishes of the American and British labor traitors and make a decision on the issue of withdrawing from the trade union in September.
    The CIO Executive Committee decided on the 19th of this month to withdraw from the WFTU and ordered all progressive trade union leaders to sever relations with various institutions affiliated with the WFTU, threatening them with expulsion from membership. However, Bridges, president of the West Coast Longshoremen's Union, still stated that he would maintain contact with the WFTU. Henderson, president of the Food and Tobacco Workers Union, also said that he would participate in the preparatory committee of the International Food Industry Workers' Department of the WFTU, which will be held in Rome soon. In addition, the postal workers, railway workers, miners, bakers, and civil servants' trade unions in various parts of Belgium have also passed resolutions resolutely opposing the proposal of the Central Committee of the Belgian General Federation of Labor to withdraw from the WFTU.
    Contrary to the desire to split the international solidarity of workers, after the US, British, and Dutch trade unions decided to withdraw from the WFTU in January, trade unions from Japan and Germany joined in February, and trade unions from Mongolia, Tunisia, and the Philippines joined in May, increasing its membership to 67 million (64 million in 1945). Recently, the National Congress of the Panama Workers' Confederation also approved joining the WFTU and the Latin American Labor Confederation. Moreover, the WFTU continues to expand its activities and has decided to establish international industrial departments to strengthen the struggle for the specific interests of the working class and for world peace and democracy. The establishment of international industrial departments will inevitably increase the WFTU's influence among the working class.
    Although the splitting activities of the American and British labor traitors have failed, their ambitions have not died, and they are now carrying out new conspiracies. The agents of US and British monopoly capital in the international workers' movement, led by the AFL, the CIO, and the British Trades Union Congress, are planning to hold a meeting in Geneva next month to establish a yellow world labor alliance. The laboring people of Asian countries deeply understand who is in charge of the Asian Labor Federation and what their goals are. They know that along with the invasion of American capital comes the support of reactionary rule, the support of colonial wars in Indonesia and Malaya, and the increasing oppression and exploitation of the laboring people. The laboring people also know that the WFTU opposes colonial enslavement of "backward" countries, opposes the exploitation of local workers and the deprivation of their rights, opposes fascism, and opposes instigating new wars. Therefore, the laboring people will, as before, continue to firmly fight under the banner of the WFTU—the true organization of the working class—to improve the living standards of workers, to strive for democratic freedom, and to strive for lasting international peace.

### 美英垄断资本家　最近分裂国际工人运动的活动

　　美英垄断资本家
  　最近分裂国际工人运动的活动
    美英垄断资本家在工会中的代理人，于一月间美国产业工会联合会与英国职工大会及荷兰总工会企图以退出世界职工会联合会来破坏工人阶级的国际团结失败以后，现在继续积极进行分裂活动，包括分裂亚洲工人运动的活动。美国垄断资本分裂工人运动的工具——美国劳工联合会的反动领导机关，想以在拉丁美洲组织“泛美劳工联合会”和在欧洲组织“职工会咨询委员会”的同样方法，在亚洲也拼凑一个赞同美国垄断资本的所谓“亚洲劳工联合会”，并使亚洲各国职工会脱离世界工联，借以打击这个为工人利益而斗争的真正工人组织。为此目的，在美国劳联的策动下，由印度统治阶级于前年成立以对抗全印职工大会的半官方的印度全国职工会发起，曾决定五月六日至八日在印度的印多尔举行“亚洲劳工联合会”筹委会，会前曾分邀印度、巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其、锡兰、泰国、缅甸、菲律宾、澳大利亚等国职工会派遣代表出席，但只有两名伊朗代表和三名西巴基斯坦的代表抵达印度。参加与这一会议同时举行的印度全国职工会的人也不得不承认：由于有组织的工人强烈反对分裂计划，其他国家的代表都不能到印多尔来，因此会议没有开成。为了掩饰他们的失败和继续进行分裂阴谋，遂又决定于二十六日在日内瓦举行会议，由亚洲国家的“职工会”代表研讨成立“亚洲劳工联合会”的可能性，然而，可以预料，这一会议也不会比印多尔的会议有更巩固的基础。
    美国劳联领导机关为了策划对亚洲工人团结的分裂活动，已决定在孟买和东京设立办事处。在欧洲进行分裂活动的劳联代表布朗，已经把他的办事处由巴黎移到孟买。同时，与亚洲分裂活动配合，美英工贼压迫和影响新西兰、丹麦、瑞典职工会高级领导机关，作出退出世界工联的决定，而澳大利亚职工大会的书记，也表示将秉承美英工贼的意旨，于九月对退出工联问题采取决定。
    美国产联执行委员会已于本月十九日决定退出世界工联，并以开除会员会籍为威胁，下令一切进步工会领袖与世界工联所属的各种机构断绝关系。但是，西岸码头工人工会主席布利治仍声明他将与世界工联保持联系。食品与烟草工人工会主席韩德逊也说，他将要参加不久在罗马召开的世界工联的国际食品业职工部筹委会。而比利时各地的邮务工人、铁道工人、矿工、面包工人和公务员职工会也都纷纷通过决议，坚决反对比利时总工会中央委员会关于退出世界工联的提议。
    与分裂工人国际团结的愿望相反，在美、英、荷工会一月间决定退出世界工联以后，二月间有日本和德国两国职工会，五月间有蒙古、突尼西亚及菲律宾三国职工会参加了世界工联，使它的会员增加到六千七百万（一九四五年为六千四百万）。最近，巴拿马工人联合会全国代表大会又批准加入世界工联和拉丁美洲劳工联合会。而且，世界工联继续扩大它的活动，已决定成立国际各业职工部，以加强争取工人阶级的具体利益与争取世界和平与民主的斗争。国际各业职工部的成立，必然会增加世界工联在工人阶级中的影响。
    美英工贼的分裂活动虽然失败了，不过他们野心不死，现在又进行新的阴谋。以美国劳联、产联和英国的职工大会为首的美英垄断资本在国际工人运动中的代理人，正筹划于下月在日内瓦召开会议，成立一个黄色的世界劳工联盟。亚洲各国的劳动人民深切了解主持亚洲劳联的是谁，他们的目的是什么。他们知道，随着美国资本侵入而同时并进的是支持反动的统治，支持在印尼和马来亚的殖民地战争，以及对劳动人民日益加剧的压迫和剥削。劳动人民更知道，世界工联反对对“落后的”国家的殖民地奴役，反对压榨本地工人和剥夺他们的权利，反对法西斯主义，反对挑拨新战争。因此，劳动人民将如以前一样，继续坚决地在世界工联——工人阶级的真正组织的旗帜下，为提高工人生活水平，争取民主自由、争取国际持久和平而斗争。
