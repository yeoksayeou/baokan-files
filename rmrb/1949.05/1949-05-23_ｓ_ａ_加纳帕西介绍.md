Introduction to S. A. Ganapathy

　　S. A. Ganapathy, an Indian, was elected as a standing committee member of the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions in October 25, 1945, at the Singapore Trade Union Congress. He was in charge of the Propaganda Department and edited the Indian-language "Forward Newspaper." In December of the same year, he led 12,000 workers of the Singapore Municipal Commission (i.e., the city government) in a struggle to improve their living conditions, winning the love of the working class of all ethnicities—Malay, Chinese, and Indian. The Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions is a unified organization of the working classes of the three major ethnic groups—Malay, Chinese, and Indian. Ganapathy led the 600,000 to 700,000 organized Indian workers in Malaya to unite around the Federation of Trade Unions. In 1946, he was elected Chairman of the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions, becoming a banner of unity for the working classes of all ethnic groups in Malaya. After June 1948, British imperialism intensified its oppression of Malayan workers, and Ganapathy was brutally murdered, strangled by British imperialism on May 4. (Xinhua News Agency)
