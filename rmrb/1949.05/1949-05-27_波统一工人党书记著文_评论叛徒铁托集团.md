Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th: According to a Polish Press Agency report, the latest issue of the European Communist Information Bureau's newspaper "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy" published an article by Sam Browarski, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled "Yugoslav Trotskyites on the Road of Defection and Betrayal." Sam Browarski wrote: Less than a year after the Information Bureau's decision was announced, the Tito group's defection to the imperialist camp has become a fact; the odious role it plays for the interests of Anglo-American imperialism is exactly the same as the role played by the traitor Trotskyites. Under the guise of semi-socialist rhetoric, the Yugoslav Trotskyites are doing everything possible to lead the Yugoslav nation into a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The author then discussed the reign of terror in Yugoslavia and the Tito group's conspiracies in the Balkans. Sam Browarski concluded: The ranks of South Communist Party members who inherit the internationalist tradition of the Yugoslav working class and are loyal to Yugoslavia are growing. They have only recently developed in the socialist and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union. The Yugoslav working class is watching with hope the Yugoslav communists in their struggle against the nationalist and Trotskyite Tito group; people see in this struggle a guarantee of the rebirth of the Yugoslav revolution and socialism.

  　评论叛徒铁托集团
    【新华社北平二十五日电】据波兰通讯社消息，欧洲共产党情报局机关报“争取持久和平与人民民主”最近一期刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记萨姆·布劳斯基题为“在变节与背叛道路上的南斯拉夫托洛斯基分子”的论文。萨姆·布劳斯基写道：情报局的决定发表不到一年，铁托集团投向帝国主义阵营已成为事实；它为美英帝国主义的利益所起的可憎的作用，恰如托洛斯基叛徒们所起的作用一样。在半社会主义词句的掩饰下，南斯拉夫托洛斯基分子正在尽一切努力把南斯拉夫民族引向反对苏联与反对人民民主国家的战争。作者接着论述了南斯拉夫的恐怖统治以及铁托集团在巴尔干的阴谋活动。萨姆。布劳斯基在结语中说：继承南斯拉夫工人阶级国际主义传统与忠实于南斯拉夫的南共党员，其阵容正在增大中。他们仅仅在最近才在苏联领导的社会主义与民主阵营中发展起来。南斯拉夫工人阶级正充满着希望注视着与民族主义及托洛斯基的铁托集团进行斗争中的南斯拉夫共产党员；人们从这个斗争中看到了南斯拉夫革命与社会主义再生的保证。
