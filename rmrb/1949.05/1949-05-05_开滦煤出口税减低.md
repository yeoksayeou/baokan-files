    [Tianjin Electric] In order to support the export of Kailuan coal, the North China People's Government has ordered the Foreign Trade Administration to reduce the special export tax rate for Kailuan coal from 30% to 15%, and has approved the temporary conversion of import and production and sales taxes payable into payment in kind, in order to take care of the mine's cash flow difficulties. According to the period of Kuomintang rule, coal transported to Shanghai had to pay an adjustment fee of 30% to 60% to the pseudo-Fuel Management Committee. At the beginning of the liberation, the export tax on Kailuan coal was temporarily set at 30%. This reduction will greatly benefit the mine's production.

    开滦煤出口税减低
    【天津电】华北人民政府为扶助开滦煤出口，特令对外贸易管理局将开滦煤之特许出口税率由百分之三十降低为百分之十五，并准将应纳之进口税及产销税暂改为以实物缴纳，以照顾该矿现金周转之困难。按在国民党统治时期，煤炭运沪须向伪燃料管理委员会缴纳调整费百分之三十至六十。解放之初，开滦煤出口税暂定为百分之三十，经此降低后，对该矿生产大有裨益。
