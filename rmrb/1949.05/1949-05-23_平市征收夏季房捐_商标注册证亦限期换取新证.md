  　Trademark Registration Certificates Also Required to Be Exchanged for New Certificates by Deadline
    [Peiping City News] The Peiping Municipal People's Government issued a notice to all district governments on the 20th of this month to begin collecting summer property tax.

The tax rate is still calculated according to the spring assessment method and is divided into four categories: owner-occupied, leased, self-operated, and leased-operated. The tax standard is assessed based on the current value of the property. The tax payment location is the Finance Section of the People's Government of the district where the property is located. Collection will begin on May 20 and end on June 10. Overdue payments will be penalized according to regulations.
