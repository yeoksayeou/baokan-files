Tianjin Dispatch: The original 66 rubber factories in Tianjin have now mostly resumed operations, with 65 of them fully operational. The output and quality of general finished products have improved compared to before liberation. To support rubber industry production, the Tianjin Enterprise Company has distributed a large amount of low-priced rubber raw materials to various factories, totaling 200 tons, which has solved the difficulty of obtaining key materials. At the same time, because urban and rural relations are smooth and there is no threat of foreign goods dumping, the sales market has expanded unprecedentedly. In addition, the workers have high production enthusiasm, enabling the factories to quickly recover and develop. According to statistics, in March this year, the total output of bicycle tires and tubes from 63 rubber factories in the city reached 26,444 sets, an increase of 51.3% compared to before liberation; the total output of 65 rubber factories in the city in April exceeded that of March by 60.9%. The factories are now preparing to expand production. In April, the number of rubber industry workers in the city had increased to 1,746, an increase of more than 630 from February.

　　天津橡胶业欣欣向荣
  　六十五家工厂产量逐月增加
    【天津电】天津市原有的六十六家橡胶工厂，现在已经有六十五家全部复工，一般成品的产量和质量都比解放前提高。为扶植橡胶业生产，天津市企业公司曾经以大批廉价的橡胶原料配售各厂，先后共达二百吨，解决了主要材料的困难。同时，因为城乡关系畅通，又无外货倾销的威胁，销售市场空前扩大。加之工人们生产热情很高，使各厂得以迅速恢复和发展。据统计：今年三月份全市六十三家橡胶工厂，自行车外带的总产量就达到二万六千四百四十四付，比解放前增加了百分之五十一点三；四月份全市六十五家橡胶厂的总产量超过了三月份的百分之六十点九。现在各厂正在准备扩大生产。四月份全市橡胶业工人已经增加到一千七百四十六人，比二月份增加了六百三十多人。
