Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th: A Free Greek News Agency dispatch reports that despite the police terror enacted by the Athenian Royalist Fascist authorities, the strike of Athenian civil servants continues. Those participating in the strike are employees of the Royalist Fascist government agencies and the various organs under its control, such as chambers of commerce and industrial institutions, social insurance agencies, and exchanges. The work of these organs has been brought to a standstill. The Athens radio station has also ceased work due to the employee strike.

Furthermore, a TASS dispatch reports that prisoners in the Averoff Prison in Athens have announced a hunger strike to protest the large number of secret and public massacres carried out daily by the Athenian government.

    【新华社北平二十五日电】自由希腊通讯社消息：尽管雅典保皇法西斯当局实行警察恐怖，雅典公务员罢工仍在继续中。参加罢工者为保皇法西斯政府机关及其所控制各机关的职员，如商会和工业机构、社会保险机构和交易所等。这些机关的工作都已停顿。雅典电台因为职员罢工，也停止工作。
    另据塔斯社讯：雅典阿维罗夫监狱囚犯宣布绝食，抗议雅典政府每日秘密和公开进行的大量屠杀。
