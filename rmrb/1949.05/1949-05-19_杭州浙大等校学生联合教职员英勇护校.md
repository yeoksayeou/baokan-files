　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 18th. Before the liberation of Hangzhou, students from Zhejiang University, National Art College, Hangzhou High School and other schools in Hangzhou, united with faculty and staff to carry out a heroic struggle to protect their schools. As early as January of this year, after the Kuomintang bandit gangs suffered an unprecedented defeat in the Huaihai area, the students in Hangzhou knew that their liberation was not far away. In order to cope with the persecution of students by the Kuomintang bandit gangs before their death, the three schools successively united faculty, staff and workers to form "Response Committee, School Protection Committee, Security Committee" and other school protection organizations, and raised funds and stored grain by pawning clothes and selling tickets for plays to support the struggle. In February, students from Zhejiang University and Hangzhou High School heard that the Kuomintang reactionaries were going to arrest students according to a blacklist, so they were on duty day and night on campus to be alert. Kuomintang military police broke into Hangzhou High School to arrest people, and all the students of the school quickly gathered in the square when the alarm sounded, forming a group, making it impossible for the Kuomintang military police to start. On April 21, when the students heard the victorious news of the People's Liberation Army crossing the river from the radio, they were ecstatic and immediately actively prepared to welcome the PLA into the city. On April 23, when the students of Zhejiang University learned that the bandit troops of the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, retreating from Nanjing to Hangzhou, wanted to forcibly station in the school, they immediately increased the number of posts on campus from dozens to 130, and installed electric bells and telephone for the entire school’s alarm and sentry posts in one day in the rain. They also hid the books and instruments of each department in the basement, and transported more than 200 wooden boxes of books and instruments from the College of Agriculture and thousands of books from the library to a safe area for preservation in two days. The students' resolute actions prevented the bandit army's conspiracy to destroy the school from succeeding.

　　杭州浙大等校学生联合教职员英勇护校
    【新华社杭州十八日电】杭州市浙江大学、国立艺专、杭州高中等校学生在杭市解放前，曾与教职员、工友团结一起进行了保护学校的英勇斗争。还在今年一月间，当国民党匪帮在淮海地区遭受空前惨败后，杭州的学生们就知道自己解放的日子已经不远了。为了应付国民党匪帮在垂死前对学生的迫害，该三校学生即先后联合教职员、工友组成“应双会、护校会、安全会”等护校组织，并以典卖衣物、演戏售票等办法筹款储粮，支持斗争。二月间浙大、杭高的学生们听说国民党反动派要根据黑名单抓捕学生，便在校内昼夜值班警戒。国民党军警曾闯入杭高抓人，该校全体学生闻警迅速齐集广场，围成一团，使国民党军警无从下手。上月二十一日学生们从收音机里听到人民解放军渡江的胜利消息时都兴奋若狂，随即积极进行欢迎解放军进城的准备工作。四月二十三日浙大学生得知自南京溃退来杭的南京卫戍司令部匪军欲强驻该校，立即将校内岗位由数十人增加到一百三十人，冒雨在一天内装好全校作警报用的电铃和了望哨的电话，并把各系图书仪器藏到地下室里，将农学院二百余木箱图书仪器和图书馆数千册书籍，在两天内全部装送到安全地带保存。学生们的坚决行动，使匪军破坏学校的阴谋未能得逞。
