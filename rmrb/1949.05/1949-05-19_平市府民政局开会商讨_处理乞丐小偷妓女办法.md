　　Peiping Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau Meets to Discuss
  　Methods for Dealing with Beggars, Thieves, and Prostitutes
    [This Newspaper] The Peiping Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau convened a meeting yesterday (18th) morning to discuss the issues of dealing with beggars, thieves, and prostitutes. Representatives from eight units attended, including the Civil Affairs Department of the North China People's Government, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Peiping Municipal People's Government, the Public Security Bureau, the Military Police, the Women's Committee, the Court, and the Relief Home. Regarding the issues of beggars and thieves, Shi Huailin, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, first explained that begging is a social problem, caused by the bankruptcy and unemployment of many people due to thousands of years of feudal bureaucratic rule. The problem of unemployment must be solved through the restoration and development of production in order to completely solve the problem of begging. A gradual approach should be adopted in batches and should not be rushed. Priority should be given to taking in those who have labor capacity and no family burden. At the same time, the elderly, weak, orphaned, disabled, and children who are helpless should be taken in and prepared for long-term relief. Thieves and pickpockets are also a social problem. They generally have organizations, and they should not be arrested indiscriminately; they should be dealt with separately. Thieves and pickpockets currently detained in the Public Security Bureau and the Court should be dealt with by themselves and sent directly to the labor brigade in direct contact with the North China People's Government. At the meeting, based on the above spirit, after careful discussion, specific handling methods were formulated: (1) Beggars and thieves shall be escorted by the Public Security Bureau, the Military Police, and the People's Governments of various districts. (2) Thieves and pickpockets who have committed crimes shall be sent to the People's Court after being arrested. After judgment and identification, those who have no family burden and have labor capacity shall be sent to the Civil Affairs Bureau for handling. (3) Beggars who have labor capacity and no family burden shall be sent to the labor brigade; helpless elderly, weak, orphaned, disabled, and young child beggars shall be sent to the relief home for separate handling. (4) Those who used to be thieves but have now changed careers, or those without evidence, shall not be arrested. (5) Rural beggars are prohibited from entering the city, but there are no restrictions on beggars leaving the city, and door guards are notified to pay attention to inspection. Everyone agreed that the issue of prostitutes is also a social problem. The Civil Affairs Bureau, the Women's Committee, the Public Security Bureau, and the Military Police Headquarters will jointly send cadres to form a working group, starting on the 24th of this month to first understand the situation, and then decide on the handling policy. Those prostitutes who are organized and have leaders, and those who have been subjected to illegal beatings and abuse, should be abolished. (Chao Qi)

　　平市府民政局开会商讨
  　处理乞丐小偷妓女办法
    【本报讯】平市人民政府民政局于昨日（十八）上午召开关于处理乞丐、小偷和妓女问题的会议。出席华北人民政府民政部，北平市人民政府民政局、公安局、纠察队、妇委、法院、救济院等八单位代表。关于乞丐、小偷问题，民政局史怀林局长首先说明乞丐乃是一个社会问题，为几千年来封建官僚统治迫使好多人破产失业而造成的。必须从恢复和发展生产中解决失业问题，才能彻底解决乞丐问题。应采取分批逐步处理，不应过急。首先收容有劳动力并且没有家庭负担的。同时对无依无靠的老弱孤寡残废小孩加以收容，准备长期救济，小偷扒手。也是社会问题，他们一般的都有组织，不应全盘一律的乱抓、应加以分别处理。现在公安局和法院内扣押的小偷扒手，应自行处理，和华北人民政府直接联系，迳送往劳动大队。会上大家根据上述精神，周密讨论后，订出具体处理办法：（一）乞丐小偷由公安局、纠察队及各区人民政府负责扭送。（二）已犯案之小偷扒手，被抓后，先送人民法院，经判决甄别后，确无家庭负担有劳动力者，再送民政局处理。（三）乞丐有劳动力又无家庭负担者，送往劳动大队；无依无靠老弱孤寡，残废和幼童乞丐，一律送救济院分别处理。（四）过去系小偷，现在已转业，或无证据者，不在被抓之列。（五）禁止乡村乞丐进入城市，但乞丐出城不加限制，通告门警注意检查。妓女问题，大家也都认为是社会问题。由民政局、妇委、公安局、纠察总队等共同派出干部，组成工作组，自本月二十四起日先进行了解情况，然后决定处理方针，对于有组织有领导的妓女，有受非法拷打、虐待行为的，应予废除。（超祺）
