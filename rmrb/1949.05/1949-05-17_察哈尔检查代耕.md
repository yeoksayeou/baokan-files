[Chahar News] In order to further promote the production and substitute farming work for the families of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and disabled soldiers, the Chahar Provincial People's Government, together with the Political Department, Armed Forces Department, and Logistics Command of the Chahar Provincial Military Region, recently organized a work team of 48 cadres. They will go to the Chahar South, Yanbei, and Nankou special districts to work with the cadres of each special district, county, and district to thoroughly improve the production and substitute farming work for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres in each region, so that their lives can be guaranteed. In terms of work steps, a typical county will be used as a starting point, and after absorbing experience, it will be promoted throughout the province. The work team has now set off on the 7th and 8th of this month. (Chahar Provincial Government Civil Affairs Department Communication Group)
[Chahar News] Huolu County, in conjunction with the rush planting of cotton, inspected the substitute farming work for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers without labor and found that there were still serious biases in some villages, which affected the production of military families. The number of workdays stipulated for the substitute farming land was too small. Military families believed that "too few workdays cannot irrigate the land or apply fertilizer," and the substitute farming households also felt that they were at a disadvantage. Many village cadres believed that it was all right to contract it out and did not pay close attention to inspection, which affected the production of military families. For example, in Gaoqian and other three villages, other people's wheat fields had been irrigated twice, but the seven military families' land had not even been irrigated once. In Dujiazhuang, District One, even a 63-year-old woman was counted as half a laborer.
The reasons for the above phenomena are: First, the bureaucracy of the leadership, neglecting the inspection of substitute farming, and being satisfied with "contracting it out" without checking how it was contracted. If there were problems, they were not resolved in time. Second, the duty system was not sound, and work could not be leveled and equalized on time, causing general village cadres to believe that the number of workdays stipulated was too much, and the village suffered losses. Third, the education of village cadres and substitute farming households on preferential treatment for military personnel was neglected, and the substitute farming work was not formed into a conscious mass movement.
After review, in conjunction with the distribution of preferential grain to military families, meetings of martyrs, soldiers, and workers' families were generally convened to conduct education and inspection, solicit opinions from military families, and solve problems. Village cadres were also educated to implement a duty system of leveling and equalizing work to achieve fairness and rationality in the labor burden.

　　察哈尔检查代耕
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔省人民政府为进一步推动烈士、军人、干部家属和荣军的生产和代耕工作，近与察哈尔省军区政治部、武装部、后勤司令部，共同组织工作组，共计干部四十八人，分赴察南、雁北、南口各专区，会同各专、县、区干部把各该地区烈、军、干属的生产和代耕工作彻底搞好，使他们在生活上得到保障。在工作步骤上，先由典型县做起，吸收经验后，推广全省。现工作组已于七、八日先后出发。（察哈尔省府民政处通讯小组）
    【察哈尔讯】获鹿县结合突击种棉，检查了对无劳力的烈、军、工属代耕工作，发现某些村庄还存在着严重的偏向，影响军属生产。对代耕地工数规定的太少，军属认为“工太少，浇不了地、上不了粪”，代耕户也感到吃亏。不少村干部认为包出去就没事了，而不抓紧检查，结果使军属生产受到影响，如高迁等三个村，别人麦地已浇了二水，七户军属地连头水也没浇。一区杜家庄甚至把六十三岁的老妇也计算成半个劳动力。
    产生以上现象的原因：首先是领导上的官僚主义，忽视代耕检查，满足于“包出去了”不检查怎样包的，有了问题，也不及时解决。其次是勤务制度不健全，不能按期平工齐工，致使一般村干部认为工数规定的太多了，村里吃亏。第三是忽视对村干部及代耕户优军工作教育，未把代耕工作形成群众的自觉运动。
    检讨后，结合发军属优待粮普遍召开了烈、军、工属会议，进行教育检查，征求军属意见，解决问题。并教育村干部，贯彻平工齐工的勤务制度，以达劳力负担的公平合理。
