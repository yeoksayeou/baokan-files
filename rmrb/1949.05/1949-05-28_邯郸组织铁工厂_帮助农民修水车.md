　　Handan Organizes Iron Factories
  　Helping Farmers Repair Waterwheels
    [Jinan Dispatch] The Handan Municipal Government has mobilized and organized various iron factories to repair waterwheels for farmers. The city originally had 458 waterwheels, but due to destruction by the Japanese and puppet regimes, 153 now need repair. Currently, there is a drought, and farmers urgently need repairs. The municipal government mobilized and organized thirteen iron factories, including the Construction Company, Shengji, and Taimao, to carry out repairs, and assisted both parties in negotiating fair prices, adopting an ordering method, with orders collectively placed by the district or village. Repairs have now begun, and the workers are highly enthusiastic, guaranteeing fine and durable work.
