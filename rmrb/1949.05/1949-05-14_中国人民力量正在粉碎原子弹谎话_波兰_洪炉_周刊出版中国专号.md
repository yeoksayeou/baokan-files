Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th: Warsaw (Polish Press Agency dispatch) - The political and literary journal "Forge" here has published a special issue on China. The first page features a portrait of Mao Zedong. The journal reprints many woodcuts by Chinese artists, illustrating the free and happy life of the people in the Chinese Liberated Areas and the lives of the people under Kuomintang rule. The center spread features a translation of Ai Qing's poem "He Died for the Second Time." The journal excerpted a passage from "China Roars" by Theodore White and Annalee Jacoby, describing the birth and organization of the Chinese Communist army; and a passage from Edgar Snow's "Red Star Over China" about the Chinese Communist army crossing the Dadu River during the Long March from South China to Yan'an. The journal also reviewed a Polish translation of Lao She's novel "Zhao Ziyue," directly from the Chinese book.

The journal includes an essay by Wiatrzyk discussing the revolutionary process in China since 1911, stating that the Chinese revolution is creating what China needs: a world peace that lasts as long as possible. China has deprived imperialism of a powerful material, military, and psychological base and is crushing a cherished theory of imperialism, which says that world socialism can be defeated by blockade and intervention, by atomic bomb blitzkrieg. The Chinese revolution has created a new revolutionary situation in Asia comparable to the situation created by the 1917 revolution in Europe. Another essay signed with the initials "G.M." titled "Chiang Kai-shek's Downfall," discusses Chiang Kai-shek's birth, his counter-revolution, his passive resistance against Japan, and his frantic attacks on the Chinese Communist Party, especially after the massive influx of American money and equipment poured into him after Japan's surrender. Chiang Kai-shek launched a war against the Chinese People's Army. The result of this war is that Chiang Kai-shek has withdrawn from the stage of history.

    中国人民力量正在粉碎原子弹谎话
    波兰“洪炉”周刊出版中国专号
    【新华社北平十三日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：此间政治与文学书刊“洪水”出版中国专号。第一页是毛泽东的像片。该刊转载了许多中国艺术家的木刻，说明中国解放区人民的自由幸福生活和国民党统治下人民生活的幸福。中间全页登载艾青的诗“他死在第二次上”的译文。该刊摘录白修德和贾安所作“中国在怒吼”中形容中国共产党军队的诞生和组织的一段；史“西行漫记”中谈中共军从华南向延安长征时通过大渡河的一段。该刊并评论直接从中文书本上的老舍著的小说“赵子曰”的波兰文译本。该刊有一篇由维昂齐克作的论文，谈中国一九一一年以来的革命进程，说中国革命在创造着中国所需要的那件东西，即尽可能持久的世界和平。中国剥夺了帝国主义一块强大的物质、军事与心理基地，正在粉碎着帝国主义一种心爱的理论，这种理论说，世界社会主义是可以用封锁和干涉，用原子弹闪击战来打垮的，中国革命在亚洲造成一种可以与一九一七年的革命在欧洲造成的形势相比拟的新革命形势。另一篇盖名著的论文题为“蒋介石的下台”，谈到蒋介石的出生，他的反革命，他的消极抗日和疯狂地进攻中国共产党，特别是当日本投降后大举的美金和装备倾注给他的时候。蒋介石向中国人民军队发动了战争。这个战争的结果就是蒋介石退出了历史舞台。
