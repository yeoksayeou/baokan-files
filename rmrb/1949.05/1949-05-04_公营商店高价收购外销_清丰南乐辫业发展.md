　　Publicly Owned Stores Purchase Export Products at High Prices
  　Braid Industry Develops in Qingfeng and Nanle
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] In order to develop the grass braid industry in Qingfeng and Nanle counties and expand foreign trade, the public braid company in Tazhuang (Qingfeng County) has specifically planned to increase braid prices to stimulate mass production enthusiasm and improve quality and increase output. Braid prices were lower in March. From April 1st to 7th, during that week, the price of high-quality braids (40-70 catties per bundle) was raised from 8,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan; medium-quality braids (80-110 catties per bundle) were raised from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan; and coarse braids (120-200 catties per bundle) were raised from 3,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. By April 12th of this month (April), the price of high-quality braids had been raised again to 32,000 yuan, medium-quality braids to 25,000 yuan, and coarse braids to 9,000 yuan. In half a month, the price of high-quality braids increased threefold, medium-quality braids increased fourfold, and coarse braids increased twofold. Due to the increase in braid prices, the masses’ enthusiasm for production has been greatly stimulated. Women within a 30-li radius of Xian Village, Nanle, and Hanzhang have universally participated in braid production, with some even working day and night. The number of private braid workshops has increased from four in March to twelve in April, and is still continuing to grow. Currently, public and private braid workshops purchase about 100 bundles per day, spending approximately 2 million yuan. Due to the destruction caused by the enemy during the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the devastation inflicted by the Kuomintang bandit troops over the past three years, the braid industry in Nanle and Qingfeng has suffered greatly. Therefore, although the government is strongly supporting it, it is still difficult to restore it to pre-war levels in the short term. However, from a development perspective, it is progressing smoothly. The current issues are: how to organize and expand the production area, improve quality, and increase output.

　　公营商店高价收购外销
  　清丰南乐辫业发展
    【冀鲁豫电】为了发展清丰、南乐草帽辫业，开展对外贸易，他庄（清丰县）公营辫业公司，特有计划的提高辫价，刺激群众生产情绪以提高质量，增加产量。三月份辫价较低，自四月一日至七日一周内上等辫子每包四十斤至七十斤由八千元提到一万六千元；中等辫子（每包八十斤至一百一十斤者）由五千元提到一万元；粗辫（一百二十斤至二百斤者）由三千元提到五千元；至本月（四月）十二日以后，上等又提到三万二千元、中等已提到二万五千元、粗辫提到九千元；在半月之内上等提高三倍、中等提高四倍，粗辫提高两倍。由于辫价提高，大大刺激了群众生产情绪，在仙庄、南乐、韩张周围三十里以内，妇女已普遍参加了辫业生产，甚至有的昼夜不息。私人辫庄，三月份原为四家，至四月份已发展到十二家，现仍继续增添。目前生产数量公私辫庄每日买进百包左右，约开支二百万元。由于八年抗战中敌人的破坏与三年来国民党匪军的摧残，使南乐、清丰辫业，受创甚大。因之目前虽有政府大力扶置，但一时还很难恢复战前水平。但从发展上看则是很顺利的，今后的问题是：如何组织扩大生产地区提高质量、增加产量的问题。
