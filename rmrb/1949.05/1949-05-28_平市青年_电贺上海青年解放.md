　　Beijing Youth
  　Telegraphic Congratulations to Shanghai Youth on Liberation
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Youth organizations jointly sent a telegram of condolences and congratulations to the Shanghai youth who have struggled hard and have been liberated. The original telegram is as follows: Shanghai youth brothers and sisters:
    Let us all cheer for the liberation of Shanghai, China's largest city! Today we are standing under the banner of Mao Zedong at the same time. Let us applaud enthusiastically and shake hands tightly.
    When Shanghai was still under the bloody rule of the reactionaries, we were always worried about the suffering you suffered. When we heard that your schools were dissolved by the Kuomintang reactionary executioner Chen Daqing on April 17, and the massive arrests on the midnight of April 25 and the early morning of the 26th, and ordered fifteen universities to withdraw from Shanghai before April 30, we had infinite anger and hatred; when we heard that you rose up to fight heroically against the reactionaries in order to protect the people's factories and schools, we were extremely moved and excited.
    The liberated Beijing young workers have actively launched a production upsurge with the qualifications of the new society's masters; tens of thousands of young students have joined the revolutionary ranks, and the students in the schools have established a new learning attitude, and are working harder to build a new democratic China in the future!
    Following the cheers of victory, standing under the great banner of Mao Zedong, we are willing to work with you to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and build a new China with people's democracy!

  　电贺上海青年解放
    【本报讯】平市青年团体联合致电慰问与祝贺艰苦斗争并已获得解放的上海青年，原电如下：上海市青年兄弟姐妹们：
    我们同声为中国最大都市上海的解放而欢呼吧！我们今天已经同时站在毛泽东旗帜下了，让我们热烈地鼓掌，紧紧地握手吧。
    当上海尚在反动的血腥统治之下，我们无时无刻不为你们所遭受的苦难耽心，当我们听到你们在四月十七日被国民党反动派刽子手陈大庆解散你们的学校，和四月二十五日午夜，二十六日清晨的大逮捕，并勒令十五所大学在四月三十日以前撤离上海时，我们有无限的愤怒和仇恨；当我们听到你们为了保护人民的工厂和学校，起来与反动派作英勇的斗争时，我们又无比的感动和兴奋。
    解放后的北平青年工人积极地以新社会主人的资格掀起了生产的热潮；青年学生成千成万的加入了革命的队伍，而在学校的同学们已经建立起新的学习态度，为将来建设新民主主义的新中国而加倍努力了！
    紧随着胜利的欢呼，站在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下，我们愿与你们为消灭反革命残余力量、建设人民民主新中国而奋斗！
