　　The "Instructions of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Provinces, Regions, and Cities of North China on Anti-Drought Production, Thrift, and Disaster Preparedness" published in yesterday's newspaper is an extremely urgent task on the agricultural production front. All comrades in the Party must lead the people to work hard, resolutely implement it, and guarantee its successful completion. Regarding how to correctly implement these instructions, we would like to offer a few more suggestions here.
    First of all, leading Party and government organs and cadres at all levels must pay close attention to the crop failure caused by drought, lack of rain, windstorms, freezes, and insect pests this year, and concentrate all efforts to make emergency rescues! "Production is the central task that overrides everything." As far as we know, this spirit has not been fully grasped by all cadres. Some places are still entangled in tasks such as concluding land reform, party consolidation, and assessing yields; some places have relaxed their leadership of agricultural production after entering the cities, and know too late and too little about the many changes in agricultural conditions, and even the information obtained is not true; there are also places where various tasks are "advancing at the same pace" (such as collecting old loans, adjusting cadres, and other constructions), using forces equally, which delays production. These biases that ignore production as the center, ignore the seasonality that production work must grasp, are the main reasons for the laissez-faire leadership of production in various places. It is hoped that all localities will conduct necessary checks when conveying and implementing the anti-drought production instructions, correct biases, seek unified understanding, unified leadership, and concentrated forces.
    Secondly, it is necessary to constantly encourage cadres and the broad masses of people to be combative and proactive in the struggle against drought production and overcoming all disasters. In the face of disasters, they must show a tenacious spirit of "man can conquer nature," and not listen to nature and simply sigh helplessly. People should still remember last year's vivid struggle experience: the Party, relying on the people, overcame the situation of various disasters intersecting, such as drought, flood, waterlogging, and insects, and victoriously achieved a 70% harvest from the most difficult situation, and achieved a great achievement in autumn plowing and wheat planting exceeding previous years. This is by no means accidental, but the result of mobilizing the people to actively struggle! Recently, we have received some very good reports from various places, but many reports in some areas only focus on listing the disasters, and there are fewer reports on actively seeking countermeasures and organizing the masses to fight against disasters. Of course, this cannot represent the actual situation in various places at most, it can only be used as an alarm to remind everyone to pay attention. Since last year's experience has proved that we can overcome all disasters, now that North China is completely liberated, land reform and party consolidation in the old and semi-old areas have been completely completed, cities can support the countryside, war service has been greatly reduced, and other conditions more favorable than last year will increase our strength and confidence even more. We have the experience of the Anti-Japanese War, especially last year, and we also have unprecedented favorable conditions. We should encourage the Party and the people to work together to strive for greater victories than last year. Finally, it is hoped that major cities will also pay attention to and implement the anti-drought production instructions of the North China Bureau. This is not only because the suburbs of the cities have the same situation, but it also means that in today's completely liberated North China, the cities and the countryside have broken the historical gap, and can be said to be closely related and share the same fate. If the countryside has a poor harvest, it will inevitably affect the supply of food and raw materials to the cities, and the purchasing power of farmers to the cities will also decrease. Therefore, in the face of the urgent task of anti-drought disaster relief, our people's cities should carry forward the exemplary spirit of rescuing cattle plague in Chahar in the previous period, mobilize technicians, intellectuals, scientific circles, and industrial circles to lend a hand to support the countryside, and help the farmer brothers who are fighting against various disasters. Whether it is agricultural tools and equipment, or insect and epidemic prevention medicines, as long as they meet the needs of the countryside, they are warmly welcomed by the farmers.
    It has been raining in various places, but we must not relax our efforts in anti-drought production, thrift, and disaster preparedness because of the rain. Be sure to implement the instructions of the North China Bureau to the end. In areas where it has rained: hurry up and rush to plant, replant, and protect seedlings. In areas where it has not rained, be sure to find a way to plant. Whether it is cities, villages, or government organizations, all should set out thrift methods, make careful calculations, tighten expenses, eliminate waste, and establish the most strict thrift system. All the people of North China must be invested in the wave of production and thrift, and rescue the now-formed crop failure like fighting a fire, and actively mobilize to strive for a better harvest!

### 执行抗旱生产节约备荒指示应注意一些什么？

　　执行抗旱生产节约备荒指示应注意一些什么？
    昨日本报发表的“中共中央华北局为抗旱生产节约备荒给华北各省各区各市的指示”，是当前农业生产战线上万分紧迫的任务，全党同志必须领导人民努力以赴，坚决贯彻，保证胜利完成，关于如何正确地执行这一指示，我们想在此再提供几点意见。
    首先各级党政领导机关及干部均必须高度注意今年由于天旱缺雨以及风灾冻灾虫害所造成的歉收现象，集中全力作紧急挽救！“生产是压倒一切的中心任务”，据我们所知：这一精神尚未能为所有干部所完全领会，有的地方仍然纠缠于结束土改整党评产量等工作；有的地方进入城市后便放松了农业生产的领导，许多农业情况的变化均知道得太迟、太少，甚至所得情报不真实；也有的地方是各种工作“齐头并进”（如收旧贷、调整干部、其他建设等），平均使用力量，结果耽误了生产。以上这些忽视以生产为中心的偏向，忽视生产工作必须掌握季节性的偏向，即是各地生产领导自流的主要原因，希望各地在传达与执行抗旱生产指示时最好能进行必要的检查，纠正偏向，求得认识一致，领导统一，力量集中。
    其次，要随时随地鼓舞干部及广大人民对于抗旱生产战胜一切灾害的斗争性和积极性，在灾害的面前要表现顽强的“人定胜天”的斗志，而不要听其自然，徒唤奈何。去年的生动斗争经验人们是都还该记得的：党依靠人民曾战胜了旱涝水虫各种灾害交集的局面，从最困难的境地中胜利地取得了一个七成年景，并取得秋耕种麦超过往年的巨大成绩，这绝非偶然，乃是发动人民积极斗争的结果！最近我们曾收到各地一些很好的报导，但也有不少地区报导只偏重于罗列灾情，对于从积极方面谋求对策组织群众抗灾斗争的反而较少，当然这并不能代表各地实际情况，最多只能是作为一个警报来提醒大家注意。既然去年经验证明我们能战胜一切灾害，那么，今年华北完全解放，老区半老区土改整党已完全结束，城市可以支援乡村，战勤大大减少等等，较去年更为有利的条件，将会增加我们以更大的力量和信心，我们有了抗战期间特别是去年的经验，又有了空前有利的条件，应当鼓舞党和人民共同努力争取比去年更大的胜利。　最后，希望各大城市同样注意与执行华北局抗旱生产指示，这不仅是因为城市的市郊具备同样的情况，而是说：在华北完全解放的今天，城市与乡村已打破历史上的隔阂，可以说是利害相关休戚与共，农村歉收了，必然会影响到对城市食粮和原料的供给，农民向城市的购买力也会减低。因此，在抗旱救灾紧急任务面前，我们的人民城市应发扬前一时期抢救察北牛瘟的模范精神，动员技师、知识界、科学界、工业界大家伸出手来支援农村，为正在与各种灾害斗争中的农民弟兄助一把力。无论是农具器材，防虫防疫药品，只要适合农村需要，均为农民所热烈欢迎。
    现在各地已陆续下雨，但绝不可因雨而松懈我们抗旱生产节约备荒的努力。一定要把华北局指示贯彻到底。已下雨地区：赶快抢种补种保苗，尚未落雨地区一定要想办法种上，无论城市、乡村、机关团体均应定出节约办法，精密计算，紧缩开支，消灭浪费，建立最严格的节约制度，全华北人民都要投入到生产节约浪潮去，象救火一样地来抢救现已形成的歉收现象，并积极动员为争取较好年成而努力！
