(JiluYu Electric) Private tobacco factories in Heze, such as Xinfeng Tobacco Factory, Yihe Tobacco Factory, Hengtai Tobacco Factory, and Beida Tobacco Factory, are collectively raising funds to establish oil pressing factories due to the significant increase in the production of economic crops such as rapeseed, peanuts, and raw cotton in the region this year, as well as the smooth sales of vegetable oils needed by cities and for export. They have already found factory sites and purchased an oil press, which can press about 15,000 catties of beans per day. The new machine was tested a few days ago, and the situation was good. The Heze Office of the People's Bank of China believes that it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and in addition to actively assisting it, it will also provide loan support. The diesel fuel used by the oil press can be purchased nearby in Jinan. They are currently raising working capital, purchasing raw materials, and establishing personnel organizations, and will officially start operations next month. Manager Zhang of the factory said: "The cigarette factory has no future development. The cigarettes produced in Tianjin, Beijing, and the Central Plains are cheap and of good quality. Our region's tobacco industry is a small-scale handicraft production with backward technology, and sales are a big problem. The establishment of the oil pressing factory is still a trial. In the future, as the business expands, we will suspend the operation of the cigarette factory and fully operate the oil pressing factory."

　　菏泽信丰等私营烟厂
  　准备转营榨油业
    【冀鲁豫电】荷泽私营信丰烟厂、怡和烟厂、恒太烟厂、北大烟厂等，以今年本区的菜籽、花生、元棉等经济作物产量大增，城市和出口所需的植物油类销路顺畅，特集资筹办榨油厂。已找好厂址，购得榨油机一部，每日可压豆子一万五千斤左右。日前试用新机，情况良好，中国人民银行荷泽办事处以其有利于国计民生，除积极予以协助外，并将贷款扶助。榨油机所用柴油，可就近在济南购买。刻正筹集活动资金，购买原料，和建立人事组织，下月可正式开工，据该厂张经理谈称：“卷烟厂今后没有发展前途，平津及中原所产香烟，价廉物美，我区烟业为小手工业生产，技术落后，销路大成问题。现创办榨油厂，尚系试办性质。将来业务开展，暂停办烟厂，全力经营榨油厂。”
