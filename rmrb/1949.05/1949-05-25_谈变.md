　　Talking About Change

　　Since our army liberated Beiping, everything has been changing. The shackles have been shattered, and people are living freely. The production enthusiasm of workers has increased, and students are also concentrating on their studies. Most of them also participate in labor production to train themselves. The atmosphere on the streets is simple, lipsticks and face powder have decreased, and some semi-colonial and semi-feudal slavish habits have gradually been eliminated. People—especially those formerly called "inferiors"—can walk proudly on the streets. Beggars are also turning to labor. Not only that, but our entire work is undergoing a series of changes in the predetermined course. The original policy of encircling the cities from the countryside has now been changed to cities leading the countryside. The working style that originally adapted to the rural environment must now adapt to new conditions. The objective environment requires us to transform rapidly. This kind of change is good and necessary. This is our active change, a conscious change, and therefore it becomes normal.

　　However, there is an unconscious transformation. The objective environment is forcing them to change, but they cannot change, so they inevitably appear somewhat rigid. It is said that some teachers in schools used to talk about the bourgeois outlook on life, but today they suddenly have to talk about the Marxist-Leninist outlook on life. Because their own outlook on life has not been truly reformed, and they have not been in contact with the rough-handed workers and peasants, how can they speak vividly? Therefore, dry terms can only induce sleep, and the audience is getting smaller and smaller. But no matter what, this kind of change is also good. As long as they continue to work hard and learn humbly from the masses, it will also become good.

　　There is another kind of change, which goes astray. Although this is not the majority, such countercurrents are revealed in every rapid stream. For example, some students in schools do not abide by school rules and come and go "freely," saying that today is "liberation" and the school authorities do not dare to manage them. Some rickshaw pullers on the streets refuse to give way to cars. If the police intervene, they can stare and say, "Do you still dare to oppress people today?" It is good that the police, who used to do evil, have now reflected and reviewed themselves and dare not act recklessly anymore, but they have gone to another extreme. They dare not even enforce the correct maintenance of order, so that some people urinate on the side of the street, and some children even throw stones at women in the street. There are even a few workers who are not very conscious and do not go to work on time, stipulating that they go to work at six o'clock, but arriving at eight o'clock. The people have the right to express their opinions to any government agency and to transform this old society; but this change is not a liberal change, not an extremely democratic change, not a "liberation" without order.

　　Revolution has its revolutionary order. Without order, it will fall into a state of anarchism. May I ask, if students do not abide by school rules, how can they study step by step? If you want to urinate on the street, and he also wants to urinate on the street, and everyone is "free" to urinate on the street, then it will "collect urine into a channel", which will be unbearably smelly. Only talking about personal convenience, not talking about public discipline, only talking about personal interests, not talking about the interests of the masses, that is not called liberation, but chaos.

　　All departments must establish revolutionary order in a democratic and centralized manner. The so-called serving the masses is not for a few people, but for the interests of the entire people. If the illegal behavior of a few people is condoned, it will destroy production, destroy learning, and destroy public health, which is contrary to the principle of serving the masses.

　　Change should be normal, not abnormal.

　　谈变
    火力
    自从我军解放北平以来，一切都在改变着，枷锁被打碎了，人们都自由的生活着，工人的生产情绪提高了，学生们也安心上课了，他们大多数人还参加劳动生产，锻炼自己。街道上的风气朴素了，口红粉面已经减少，某些半殖民地半封建的奴化风气已逐渐肃清，人们——特别是过去所谓的“下人”都可昂扬地在街上行走。乞丐也在转向劳动。不仅如此，我们整个工作都在预定的途程中起着一系列的变化。原来是由乡村包围城市的方针，现在已改为城市领导乡村了。原来在适应乡村环境的工作作风，现在必须适应的条件，客观的环境在要求着我们必需迅速的转变，这种变是好的是必要的，这是我们主动的变，有意识的变，因而它变得正常。
    但是有一种不自觉的转变，客观环境在逼着他非变不可，于是他们变不过来，不免显得有些僵。听说有些学校的教员，他们过去讲的是资产阶级的人生观，而今天骤然一变，要讲起马列主义的人生观来了，由于他自己的人生观还没真正得到改革，也没接触过粗脚大手的工农群众，那怎么会讲得生动呢？因此，干枯的名词只能引人欲睡，听众越来越少。但不管怎样，这种变也是好的，只要他继续努力，虚心向群众学习，那也会变好的。
    还有一种变，他变的走了边，虽然这并不是多数，但是在每个激流里都显出了这种逆流的水沫。如象有些学校的学生不守校规，来去“自由”，说今天是“解放”了，校方不敢管理。街道上有些三轮车工不肯为汽车让路，警察去干涉他，他可以瞪上眼睛说：“你今天还敢压迫人么？”警察由于过去为非作歹，今天经过反省检讨再不敢胡行这是好的，但又走了另一偏向，正确的维持秩序也不敢执行，以致让有些人在街边拉尿，还有的小孩竟在街头拿石子打女人，甚至还有少数不很觉悟的工人，不按时上工，规定六点钟上工，八点钟才到。人民有权利对任何政府机关提出自己的意见，要把这个旧社会加以变革；但是这个变，不是自由主义的变，不是极端民主的变，不是毫无秩序的“解放”。
    革命是有革命的秩序的，没有秩序，那就会陷于无政府主义状态，试问当学生不守校规，那怎能会按步就班的学习呢？你要在街上尿尿，他也在街上尿尿，大家都在街头“自由”尿尿，那就会“集尿成渠”，臭不可当，只讲个人方便，不讲公共纪律，只讲个人利益，不讲群众利益，那不叫做解放，而是混乱。
    不管那个部门都必须以民主集中的方式建立革命秩序，所谓为群众服务，不是对少数人说的，而是为了整个人民利益说的，如果纵容了少数人的不法行为，那就会破坏生产，破坏学习，破坏公共卫生，那是与为群众服务的原则相违背的。
    变要变得正常，不要反常。
