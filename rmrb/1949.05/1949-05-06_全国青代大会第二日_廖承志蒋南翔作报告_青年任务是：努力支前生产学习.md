    National Youth Congress Day Two
    Liao Chengzhi and Jiang Nanxiang Give Reports
    Youth's Tasks Are: Strive to Support the Front, Production, and Study
    [This Newspaper's Report] The first representative conference of the All-China Youth was held yesterday (the 5th) for the second day. Comrade Liu Shanben served as chairman. The number of representatives attending increased by thirteen, including Zhang Xuesi, for a total of 493 people. Yesterday, the conference made several important reports. Comrades Liao Chengzhi and Jiang Nanxiang respectively reported on "The Youth Movement in the Chinese People's Liberation War and the Basic Tasks of Chinese Youth in the Future" and "Chinese Youth Organizations Participating in International Youth Activities." Comrade Gao Tang reported on and explained the draft constitution of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation. The conference read out congratulatory telegrams to the conference from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping and all commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhang Bojun and Peng Zemin of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party.
    Comrade Liao Chengzhi pointed out in his report that convening this National Youth Congress is the realization of the democratic unity that the Chinese youth have long awaited, and is one of the important victorious fruits of the people's revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China. He said that in the victorious advance of the Chinese people's revolution, Chinese youth is an important front army. More than 60 percent of the soldiers in the People's Liberation Army are young cadres. Young workers, who account for a large proportion, play a major role in the production front and political life, and farmers play a major role in the land reform movement, joining the army, participating in the war, and supporting the front. Chinese students, whether in the Kuomintang-controlled areas or the liberated areas, have made indelible contributions to the Chinese revolutionary movement. In addition, there are other patriotic youths and youth workers from various broad strata who have directly or indirectly cooperated with the victorious advance of the People's Liberation War in various work posts, especially in culture and education. Comrade Liao Chengzhi also pointed out that the heroic struggle of Chinese youth is not only a powerful factor in promoting the victorious development of the Chinese revolutionary movement, but also has a very important impact on the struggle of democratic youth in the East and the world. Comrade Liao Chengzhi pointed out that Chinese youth must strive to complete three important historical tasks in the future: First, implement the complete victory of the revolution and support the People's Liberation War. Second, participate in production and construction work and build China into a prosperous and strong industrialized New Democratic country. Third, study New Democracy and Mao Zedong Thought, lay the foundation for a revolutionary outlook on life and the world, and understand the process of social development and the laws of development of the Chinese revolution. He said that in order to accomplish these three tasks and build a new democratic China, Chinese youth workers, farmers, students, staff, cultural workers, patriotic youth from various democratic parties, various ethnic minorities, and various religious factions must unite as one and strive forward under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.
    Comrade Jiang Nanxiang Reports on Participating in International Youth Activities
    After Comrade Liao Chengzhi finished his report, the Youth Art Academy presented the conference with a huge silk banner, and their crisp and powerful singing performance won enthusiastic applause from the audience. Then Comrade Jiang Nanxiang gave a report to the conference on "Chinese Youth Organizations Participating in International Youth Activities." He said that Chinese democratic youth organizations have regularly participated in international democratic youth activities since the end of the Anti-Japanese War. Chinese democratic youth representatives have been elected as executive members of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and Chinese democratic student representatives have also been elected as vice-chairmen of the International Union of Students. For the past three years, Chinese democratic youth have actively participated in various activities called and organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, contributed their strength to the development of the international democratic youth movement and student movement, and have been respected and supported by international democratic youth. When Chinese youth appeared at the World Youth Conference, the Southeast Asian Youth Conference, and every other international youth conference, they were often surrounded by youth of various languages, warmly greeted, applauded, and cheered. Comrade Jiang Nanxiang said that the respect and support Chinese youth receive in international activities is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and the unprecedented and great victory of the Chinese revolution. Finally, he pointed out that the Chinese people's and Chinese youth's struggle for liberation is closely related to the entire world democratic front. He called on the youth to participate more actively in the joint activities and struggles of international youth on the one hand, and to carry out internationalist education to the vast number of Chinese youth on the other hand, resolutely support the world democratic front headed by the Soviet Union, and strengthen the unity with world democratic youth.

    廖承志蒋南翔作报告
    青年任务是：努力支前生产学习
    【本报讯】中华全国青年第一次代表大会于昨（五）日举行第二天的会议，刘善本同志任主席。到会代表增加了张学思等十三人，共计四百九十三人。昨天大会作了几个重要报告，廖承志和蒋南翔同志分别报告“中国人民解放战争中的青年运动与今后中国青年的基本任务”和“中国青年团体参加国际青年活动”。高棠同志报告与解释中华全国民主青年联合总会章程草案。大会宣读了中国共产党中央委员会，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会，刘伯承、邓小平诸将军及人民解放军第二野战军全体指战员，和中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，中国农工民主党中央委员会章伯钧、彭泽民，中国致公党中央委员会主席陈其尤等对大会的贺电。
    廖承志同志在报告里首先指出：这次召开全国青年代表大会，是实现了中国青年所久已盼待的民主团结的愿望，是中国共产党所领导的人民革命运动的重要胜利果实之一。他说：在中国人民革命的胜利进军当中，中国青年是一个重要的方面军。人民解放军的战士有百分之六十以上是青年干部。占有很大比重的青年工人在生产战线和政治生活中，农民在土地改革运动、参军参战支援前线的工作中，都起着重大作用。中国的学生，不论在国民党统治区还是解放区，他们对于中国革命运动都有着不可磨灭的功绩。除此之外，还有其他广大阶层的爱国青年和青年工作者，在各种不同的工作岗位上，特别是在文化教育上，直接或间接地配合了人民解放战争的胜利进军。廖承志同志并且指出：中国青年的英勇斗争，不但是推动中国革命运动胜利发展的一个有力因素，而且对于东方和全世界民主青年的斗争，都有很重要的影响。廖承志同志指出：中国青年今后必须努力完成三项重要历史任务；第一、贯彻革命的彻底胜利，支援人民解放战争。第二、参加生产建设工作，要把中国建设为繁荣强盛的工业化的新民主主义国家。第三、学习新民主主义和毛泽东思想，奠定革命的人生观与世界观，懂得社会发展的进程和中国革命发展的规律。他说：为了完成这三个任务，建设新民主主义新中国，中国青年的工人、农民、学生、职员、文化工作者、各民主党派、各少数民族和各宗教派别的爱国青年，要一致团结起来，在中国共产党领导之下奋斗前进。
    蒋南翔同志报告  参加国际青年活动
    廖承志同志报告完毕后，有青年艺术学院向大会献巨幅锦旗一面，他们清脆有力的歌咏表演博得全场热烈的掌声。接着由蒋南翔同志向大会作“中国青年团体参加国际青年活动”的报告，他说：中国的民主青年团体在抗日战争胜利结束之后，就经常地参加国际民主青年的活动了。中国的民主青年代表已经被选做世界民主青年联盟的执行委员，中国的民主学生代表还被选做世界学生联合会的副主席。三年以来，中国的民主青年积极地参加了世界民主青年联盟和世界学联所号召和组织的各种活动，对国际民主青年运动和学生运动的发展贡献了自己的力量，而且受到了国际民主青年的尊敬和拥护。当中国青年在世界青年大会，东南亚青年大会，以及其他每一次国际青年的会议当中出现的时候，常常是被各种不同语言的青年包围着亲切慰问，鼓掌欢呼。蒋南翔同志说：中国青年在国际活动中受到尊敬和拥护，这是跟中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，和中国革命空前伟大的胜利分不开的。最后他指出：中国人民和中国青年的争取解放斗争，是跟整个世界民主阵线休戚相关，密切联系着的。他号召青年一方面要更加积极的参加国际青年的共同活动和斗争，一方面要向中国广大青年进行国际主义的教育，坚决拥护以苏联为首的世界民主阵线，加强和世界民主青年的团结。
