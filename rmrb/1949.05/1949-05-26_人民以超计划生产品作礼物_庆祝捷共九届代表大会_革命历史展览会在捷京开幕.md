Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th: TASS, Prague: The Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, with 2.5 million members, is scheduled to open in Prague on the 25th. Not only Czech communists but the majority of the Czechoslovak people have been preparing for this congress as if it were a major historical event. To celebrate this congress, factories, mines, government offices, and scientific institutions have launched competitions. In the enterprises of the Prague district, workers over-produced goods worth 2 billion crowns (Czech currency); the western Pilsen district over-produced goods worth 687 million crowns, as gifts to the congress. The southwestern Ústí district over-produced 475 million crowns, the Brno district over-produced 100 million crowns, and the eastern Košice district over-produced 36 million crowns. To celebrate the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party, the Exhibition of the History of Revolutionary Struggle of Czechoslovakia has opened in Prague. The exhibition shows how the Czech and Slovak peoples, influenced by the great Russian October Socialist Revolution, rose up to fight for freedom and independence, and how they laid the foundation for the independence of the Czechoslovak Republic. The exhibition also reflects the historically significant liberation that the Soviet Union brought to the people of Czechoslovakia, bringing them freedom and independence.
