The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed a decision in late December of last year: "To eliminate the excessive burden of public work and other non-study work on primary and secondary school students."

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that in Soviet primary and secondary schools, there is a phenomenon of students bearing an excessive burden of public work and other non-study work. For example, in many schools, attracting students to participate in public work and various mass activities is carried out without a plan and in violation of basic educational requirements. Some schools, in violation of established school rules and regulations, excuse students from classes to complete various social tasks. Some Communist Youth League district committees summon students during study time to join the League and participate in meetings, study groups, and rehearsals. Sports organizations often organize competitions, sports meets, and drills during study time. The burden on activists of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers is particularly heavy.

Due to the excessive burden of public work and other non-study work, students' grades are lowered, cultural activities and normal rest are hindered, and the children's health is adversely affected.

Many principals and class teachers do not regulate or guide students' social and extracurricular activities, do not exercise their rights, and do not stop the errors arising from mass activities in schools.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) considers the above phenomena to be incorrect.

In the past, the Ministries of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and other union republics and local national education authorities did not pay due attention to guiding students' public work and other non-study work, and allowed the phenomenon of neglect in this area to exist in schools.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the state committees, district committees, and central committees of the Leninist Young Communist League of various union republics did not take necessary measures to prevent primary and secondary school students from bearing an excessive burden of public work and other non-study work, and often themselves initiated various mass activities, overburdening students and disrupting the normal study life of schools.

This time, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) specifically instructed the Ministries of Education of the RSFSR and other union republics and the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League to terminate the evil practice of overburdening primary and secondary school students with public tasks and other non-study tasks, considering this to be incorrect and harmful to the teaching work of schools.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believes that it is necessary to rectify the conduct of school gatherings, Young Pioneer recruitment activities, and other public activities, and ensure that the tasks of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers among students are correctly defined.

The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) emphasized that properly arranged student public work and extracurricular work should be subordinate to the teaching tasks of the school, help students study well, and assist in cultivating all-round developed and active builders of communist society.

Party, Soviet, Communist Youth League organizations, and other social groups should take measures to completely stop the evil practice of students not studying during study time to complete social tasks.

The Central Committee pointed out that the Ministries of Education of the RSFSR and other union republics and the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League should make general education institutions, Communist Youth League state committees, border region committees, and district committees pay more attention to the work of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers in schools. The task of the school principal is to take full responsibility for correctly organizing public work and other non-study work in the school. Mass activities within the school shall not be held without the permission of the principal. National education authorities should take practical measures to ensure that class teachers increase their sense of responsibility for the teaching work and the conduct of students' extracurricular activities.

### 联共中央关于中小学学生课外工作之决定

　　联共中央关于中小学学生课外工作之决定
    联共（布）中央于去年十二月下旬通过了一个决定：“取消中小学生过重负担公共工作及其他非学习工作”。
    联共（布）中央指出，在苏联中小学中，有学生担负公共工作及其他非学习工作过重的现象：如许多学校中，吸引学生参加公共工作及种种群众活动，是在无计划而破坏基本教育要求的情况下进行的；有些学校，违反既定的校规及制度，使学生不上课，以完成种种社会任务；若干共青团区委会在学习时间内召集学生加入共青团，并参加会议、研究班、排戏；体育团体常常在学习时间内组织竞赛、运动会及操练。共青团及儿童团的积极分子的负担，尤其过重。
    由于公共工作及其他非学习工作之过重，致使学生成绩降低，妨害文化活动时间及正常休息，并对于孩子们的健康有不良影响。
    许多校长及级任导师不规定和不指导学生的社会活动与校外活动，不行使已获有的权利和不制止校内进行群众活动时所产生的错误。
    联共（布）中央认为上述现象都是不正确的。
    过去苏俄及其他加盟共和国教育部和各地国民教育机关，对于领导学生的公共工作及其他非学习性工作，并没有给予应有的重视，听任学校在这一工作方面的不管现象存在。
    全苏列宁共青团中委会及各加盟共和国列宁共青团州委会、区委会和中委会，并没有采取必要措施以防止中小学生担负公共工作及其他非学习工作的过重现象，甚至往往自身即是种种群众活动的发起者，使学生的负担过重，并破坏学校的正常学习生活。
    这次联共（布）中央特责成苏俄及其他加盟共和国教育部和全苏列宁共青团中委会终止中小学校学生担负公共任务及其他非学习任务过重之恶习，认为这是不正确而损害学校教学工作的。
    联共（布）中央认为必须整顿校内集会之进行、儿童团之征募活动及其他公共活动，并保证正确地确定共青团及儿童团在学生中的任务。
    联共（布）中央着重指出，布置得正确的学生公共工作及校外工作，应该服从于学校的教学任务，帮助学生好好学习，并协助培养各方面发展的和积极的共产主义社会建设者。
    党的、苏维埃的、共青团的组织及其他社会团体，应该采取办法，完全停止使学生在学习时间内不学习而完成社会任务的恶习。
    联共中央指出，苏俄及其他加盟共和国教育部和全苏列宁共青团中委会，应该使普通教育机关、共青团州委会、边区委会、区委会多多注重学校中共青团及儿童团之工作。学校校长的任务是负全责正确地组织校内公共工作及其他非学习性工作；校内的群众活动，非经校长许可，不得举行。国民教育机关则应采取实际办法，保证级任导师对于教学工作及学生校外活动之进行提高责任心。
