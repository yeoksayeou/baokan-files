　　Defend Production, Eliminate Bandits and Special Agents
    Strengthening Security in Various Parts of North China
    [Reported by this newspaper] To protect production and construction and prevent complacency, the victory of the national revolution has led to a sense of complacency among cadres in various regions. They have not paid enough attention to the Kuomintang bandits, special agents, and scattered soldiers who are hidden and lurking in the rear, resulting in continuous incidents of sabotage of production and construction, including murder, arson, cutting power lines, and robbery. Over 1,000 meters of telephone lines were lost from the Weishui to Shijiazhuang line, and over 1,000 meters of power lines were cut in Beiping. Kuomintang bandits and special agents have also been lurking in production organizations to take the opportunity to carry out sabotage, such as the burning of 58 trolleybuses in Beiping. Bandits and special agents in the mountains surrounding Taiyuan, Xinxiang, Anyang, and other areas are constantly robbing passers-by or colluding with secret societies to assassinate mass cadres. In the Henan-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, one of our district chiefs was murdered.

    Jizhong, Chahar, Jinnan, and other regions have begun to pay attention to security work. The Jizhong District Party Committee issued instructions to the entire district on local security work, stating that the elimination of bandits and special agents and the maintenance of security must involve the earnest mobilization of the masses. It is necessary to start from the immediate interests of the masses, conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization, organize the masses to defend themselves against bandits, and carry out political work. The problem should not be solved purely by military means. Militia organizations should be meticulously organized and led, and education and management should be strengthened, especially in remote mountainous areas. The Taiyue Military Region and Administrative Office have jointly instructed that militia should be on duty to check shops and patrol, especially in the cities. The Jianping Prefectural Committee of Chahar has instructed all counties to effectively protect power lines and transportation as a regular task. Jinnan, Jidong, and other regions have also issued instructions.

　　保卫生产肃清匪特
    华北各地加强治安
    【本报讯】保卫生产建设，防止麻痹太平观念。由于全国革命的胜利，各地干部中亦产生了麻痹的太平观念，对隐蔽潜藏在后方的国民党匪特与散兵游勇未加足够的警惕，致使不断发生对生产建设破坏的事件，杀人、放火、割电线、抢掠等，从微水到石家庄一线电话线，损失一千余米，北平被割电线千余米。国民党匪特亦潜在生产机关内趁机进行破坏，如北平的电车被烧掉五十八辆。太原、新乡、安阳等外围山地匪特亦不断抢劫路人或勾结掌握会门暗杀群众干部。冀鲁豫河南我一区长被害。
    冀中、察哈尔、冀南等地开始注意治安工作。冀中区党委对当地治安工作指示全区，肃清匪特维持治安工作要认真的发动群众，必须从群众的切身利益出发，向群众深入宣传动员组织群众起来防匪自卫，并进行政治工作，不能单纯的用军事解决问题，民兵应进行细密的组织领导，加强教育管理，特别是偏僻的山地。太岳军区、行署已联合指示：民兵值班查店、巡逻，特别在城里要注意。察哈尔建屏地委已指示各县，切实保护电线及交通应当成为经常的工作。冀南、冀东等地亦有所指示。
