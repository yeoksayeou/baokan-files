[Taihang Telegram] Women in Xileng Village, Sixth District of Wenxian County, are weaving straw hats in large quantities to overcome the famine. Due to last year's flood, the village did not harvest any grain, and now about forty poor and middle peasant households are unable to maintain their livelihoods. In order to solve the current livelihood difficulties of the masses, the People's Government has specially mobilized and organized the masses to restore the original local handicraft production. In February, a village-wide women's congress was held to discuss how to fight the current famine. After discussion, everyone decided to weave and sell straw hats to overcome the famine. Of the 428 women in the village, most can weave. From February to the present, each woman has woven an average of 30 straw hats, for a total of 12,450 hats. Each straw hat sells for 30 yuan, totaling 37,350 yuan, which can buy more than 14 shi and 3 dou of millet, which is more than enough to solve current livelihood difficulties. The women in the village are now continuing to weave and organize sales in large quantities.
