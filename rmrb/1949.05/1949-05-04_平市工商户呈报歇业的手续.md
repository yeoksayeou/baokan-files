　　[Beiping News] The following procedures are now required by the competent authorities for private industrial and commercial businesses in this city to report before closing their business: All industrial and commercial businesses applying for closure should first pay the taxes owed up to the date of closure to their respective tax sub-bureaus. The tax sub-bureau will then indicate on the receipt "Business tax before closure has been paid." The business owner can then take this receipt to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to apply for closure.
