Repairing Canals, Digging Wells, Fighting Drought, and Increasing Production
　　Initial Achievements in Water Conservancy Construction in North China

[Report from this newspaper] To actively develop water conservancy to increase production and fight drought, North China is implementing the plan decided by the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference to develop two million mu of paddy fields in the entire North China region this year, under the active leadership of governments at all levels. According to incomplete reports, the following achievements have been made:

　　1. Canal Construction: In the Taiyue District, work has begun on digging a canal on the Yongli River in Jiyuan, which can restore irrigation to 15,000 mu of land. Thirty-seven villages in the county have started water conservancy construction, which will save 20,000 mu of wetland. In the Tunliu area, five canals were restored before March 15th. The Meng County government loaned 60,000 shi of grain to repair the Mang River and dig drainage canals, which were completed on April 4th, ensuring the harvest of 7,000 mu of land. In Wen County, a drainage canal was opened, employing 22,000 workers, eliminating the floods of previous years. In the Taihang District, Huixian County loaned 300,000 jin of grain to build the huge Hekou Wan Zhang Canal, which has been completed, irrigating 12,000 mu of land. In the fourth district of Taihang, the Dafan damming project in Wuzhi County was completed at the end of March, allowing 350,000 mu to be sown this spring. In the Jixi area of ​​Chahar Province, a total of 171 old canals have been repaired. Fuping has restored the Gaofu Canal and the Sanguanmiao Canal. In addition to repairing 20 large canals, Jianping has also built 1,500 mu of滩地(riverbank land) in 13 places. In Yanbei, the Sanggan River dam water gate repair project is underway. Jizhong District: Anxin repaired two canals, 30 li long; newly opened a canal, 4.5 li long; repaired six old branch canals, 42 li long; and opened small branch canals, irrigating 18,000 mu of land. The Jizhong Water Conservancy Bureau also has plans to reorganize the Anxin irrigation canals, improve existing canals, newly open two main canals, build water gates, and dig drainage canals. After completion, it can increase irrigation of 40,000 mu of dry land and improve 80,000 mu of wetland into paddy fields. In addition to digging rivers and diverting water for irrigation, the Jin Gao Irrigation Canal focuses on strengthening canal management. In Nanning, the fourth district of Jinnan District, gates were built and canals were opened on the Beifeng River, which has now been completed, irrigating 30,000 mu of land. This is directly led by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government. The largest water conservancy project in North China, the Shijin Canal Irrigation Canal, has now closed the dam, and most of the 107 concrete and stone construction projects have been completed. The remaining two large aqueduct projects can be completed in May. It is also planned to develop electric pumping in the Tianjin area to wash away alkali and plant rice. Special personnel have been sent to survey, and a water conservancy engineering team has been established. In addition, there are drainage projects in the He, Lu, and Yu districts and the Jidong district, using work as a form of relief, combined with disaster relief. In Xugou County, Jinzhong District, the Longwang Canal was repaired, and a water conservancy project capable of irrigating 120,000 mu was built.

　　2. Waterwheels and Wells: The Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society of Jizhong District supported the masses in ordering 210 large and small waterwheels, and helped 15 waterwheel factories in Shenze and Ding County to produce 850 waterwheels, an increase of 57% over last year. The Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Society has ordered 972 waterwheels and has a variety of well-drilling equipment, organizing cadres to go to the countryside to develop well-drilling. The Chahar Water Conservancy Promotion Society has loaned 360 waterwheels in Xushui, Dingxing, and Wangdu areas. The Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Society has also loaned waterwheels in Yongnian and Jize counties. One hundred and ten waterwheels were loaned in Xingtang, Huolu, and Pingshan. Ba County also helped the masses repair 30 wells with loans. In Qingyuan, six villages dug 22 earthen wells and 6 cone wells in six or seven days, which can provide water for planting 600 mu. Wenshui in Jinzhong District immediately started repairing waterwheels and wells damaged by the Yan bandits, while the North China Water Conservancy Promotion General Society ordered 3,400 waterwheels in the Shijiazhuang area. Since changing the loan method, 220 waterwheels were loaned out in six days from April 5th to 11th. The original pseudo-Hebei Machine Well-Drilling Engineering Team, since liberation, after being led by the society, all employees actively repaired machines, surveyed the topography and geology along Shijiazhuang, Pingjiao, and the Pinghan line, and drilled 67 wells in three months, using electric motors to pump water, with each well irrigating an average of 500 mu, which can increase paddy fields by 33,500 mu.

　　Summarizing the above fragmentary materials, it can be seen that there is hope for the realization of this year's farmland water conservancy construction plan. However, it is undeniable that the overall water conservancy work is not systematic enough in leadership, and some areas do not pay enough attention to it, and there are still no reports to date. Now is the time of spring drought, and leaders at all levels must grasp this work tightly. The North China Government is preparing to increase water conservancy loans recently, hoping that all regions will redouble their efforts to fight drought and increase production.

　  修渠打井抗旱增产
  　华北各地水利建设初获成绩
    【本报讯】华北各地积极兴修水利增产抗旱，华北农林会议决定今年在华北全区发展二百万亩水田的计划，现正在各级政府领导下积极实施中。据不完全的报告，已获以下的成绩：
    一、开渠方面：太岳区已着手在济源之永利河挖渠，可恢复水浇地一万五千亩。全县有卅七个村动工兴修水利，将可救出湿地两万亩。屯留地区，三月十五日前恢复水渠五道。孟县政府贷粮六万石修治漭河，开挖撤水渠，四月四日已完工，七千亩地可保收获。又温县方面开撤水渠一道，用工两万二千个，免除历年来的水患。太行区辉县贷粮三十万斤兴修河口万丈大渠，已经竣峪工，可浇地一万二千亩。太行四专区武陟县大樊堵口工程，三月底已完成，今春可播种三十五万亩。察哈尔省冀西一带，共修复旧渠一百七十一道。阜平已修复高阜大渠及三官庙渠。建屏除修复二十条大渠外，并在十三处修出滩地一千五百亩。在雁北，桑乾河拦河坝制水闸修补工程正在进行中。冀中区：安新修复两道渠，长三十里；新开渠一道，长四里半；修旧支渠六道，长四十二里；并开小支渠，可浇地一万八千亩。冀中水利局并有计划的整理安新灌溉渠，改进旧有渠道，新开干渠二道，增筑制水闸，挖排水渠，完成后可增灌旱地四万亩，并改进八万亩湿地为水田。晋藁灌溉渠除早已挖河引水浇地外，着重加强渠道管理。冀南区四专宁南，在北沣河修闸开渠，现已完成，浇地三万亩。由华北人民政府农业部直接领导进行之。华北最大的水利工程石津运河灌溉渠，目前拦河坝已经合垄，一百零七件洋灰料石建筑工程已大部筑就，所剩两个大渡槽工程，五月份可以完成。并计划在津沽一带发展电力抽水，洗碱种稻，已派专人勘查，并成立水利工程队。另外在冀鲁豫区及冀东区均有排水工程，并以工代赈，结合救灾。晋中区徐沟县修复龙王渠，并修建能浇十二万亩的水利工程。
    二、水车水井方面：冀中区第二水利推进社扶植群众订购大小水车二百一十辆，帮助深泽、定县十五个水车厂制出水车八百五十辆，较去年增加百分之五十七。冀中水利推进社已定制水车九百七十二辆，并有打井器材多种，组织干部下乡开展打井。察哈尔水利推进社已在徐水、定兴、望都一带贷出水车三百六十辆。冀南水利推进社亦在永年、鸡泽各县出贷水车。在行唐、获鹿、平山贷出水车一百一十辆。霸县亦由贷款帮助群众修井三十眼，清苑六个村在六七天内挖土井二十二眼，锥井六眼，可供挑水播种六百亩。晋中文水早即着手修复被阎匪破坏的水车水井，而华北水利推进总社则在石庄地区定制水车三千四百辆，自改变出贷办法后，四月五号至十一号六天内即贷出水车二百二十辆。原伪河北机器凿井工程队，自解放以来，归该社领导后，全体员工，即积极修理机器，勘察石庄、平郊及平汉沿线地形地质，在三个月内，凿井六十七眼，利用电力马达抽水，每井平均灌溉五百亩，可增水田三万三千五百亩。
    总合以上片断材料，可以看出实现今年农田水利建设计划是有希望的。但不可否认，整个水利工作在领导上还不够有系统，有些区重视不够，至今尚无报告。现值春旱，各级领导必须抓紧这一工作。华北政府准备最近增拨水利贷款，希望各区为抗旱增产而加倍努力。
