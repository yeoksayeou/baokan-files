    Chahar Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Pre-purchases Hemp Seeds
    Encourages Increased Production
    [Report from this newspaper] In the vast areas of northern Chahar, farmers are facing extreme hardship due to years of looting and destruction by bandits and puppet regimes. This, coupled with the current period between harvests, is severely impacting production. In order to support farmers' production and ensure the completion of the hemp production plan in northern Chahar, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to obtain 20,000 bolts of homespun cloth from the Provincial Trading Company on the condition of repayment with hemp in the autumn. These bolts will be re-advanced to laboring farmers in disaster areas of Zhangbei, Baoyuan, Shangdu, Duolun, and Chongli counties who have labor power but lack essential living and production materials. The cooperative will also pre-purchase the hemp they produce. The prices of both the homespun cloth and the hemp will be based on the local market prices at the time the farmers receive the cloth. It is also stipulated that the hemp price can be appropriately higher than the market price to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for planting hemp. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has instructed the local supply and marketing cooperatives to handle this matter conscientiously based on the actual local conditions.

    察省供销总社
    预购葫麻
    鼓励增产
    【本报讯】察北广大地区，由于过去多年匪伪的掠夺破坏，农民生活极为困难；又加以目前青黄不接，严重影响生产。省供销总社为扶助农民生产，保证察北地区的葫麻生产计划的完成，特自省贸易公司以秋后还葫麻为条件，赊入土布两万匹决定转赊给张北、宝源、商都、多伦、崇礼等五县灾区有劳动力而缺乏生活资料与生产资料的劳动农民，并预购其生产的葫麻。土布与葫麻的价格，均以农民取布时的当地市场价格为标准，并规定葫麻价格，可以适当高于市价，以刺激农民种葫麻的积极性。省供销总社已指示该地各供销社，根据当地实际情况认真办理。
