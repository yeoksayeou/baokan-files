Some Thoughts on This Year's Nurses Day
    Lin Juying
    Every year on "May 12th" we celebrate Nurses Day, and every year on "May 12th" we hold meetings and publish articles commemorating Miss Nightingale's establishment of nurse education and her spirit of service. However, this year, in the year that Beiping has been liberated, our commemoration here has a deeper and more far-reaching significance.
    I am a small soldier engaged in nursing for several years. I go to and from work on a fixed schedule every day, doing some routine nursing work. Every year on "May 12th," I follow some nursing pioneers in shouting "Celebrate Nurses Day." But to be honest, what I do is only fulfilling my responsibilities, not making any contribution to the entire nursing profession, not reaching the standard of truly serving the people, and daring not compare to the working spirit of our old ancestor, Miss Nightingale. But year after year passed, and I continued without feeling or vigilance. This year, after the complete liberation of Beiping, from the medical staff comrades I came into contact with at work in the liberated areas, from their hard study and pragmatic spirit of service, I gained some enlightenment and realized my past shortcomings. I take this opportunity to list them as a self-criticism, hoping to elicit valuable opinions, so that other nursing colleagues who have the same mistakes as me can be alert, encourage each other, and jointly promote the true spirit of service of our nurses.
    The first shortcoming I personally feel is sticking to my position and not seeking progress. I have also observed that many colleagues are like this. After graduating from school, they put all their books on the shelf. They even no longer consult recent medical journals. Every day, in addition to doing routine work, they no longer pursue new knowledge. In fact, this approach is wrong. Because nursing work is inseparable from medicine, and medical knowledge is changing rapidly and has no end. If we do not move forward, we will fall behind, and as a result, we will not be able to truly achieve progressive nursing work. Therefore, I hope that in the future, our nursing community can have organized mutual research and exploration, constantly learn new knowledge, so that the title of nursing predecessors not only represents a person's age and qualifications, but also their knowledge and progress.
    The second point is that my understanding of modern politics and society is not clear. Because the nursing profession was relatively aloof in the past society, most nursing colleagues have developed an indifference to current affairs. Whether it is the Kuomintang or the Communist Party, medical work must be maintained, and technical personnel must be retained. With this skill, there is no worry about not having food to eat. So they put aside some knowledge of the times and only talk about their own profession. In fact, political and social changes are enough to affect the future of individuals and even the entire nursing profession. We must not only recognize the era we are in, but also be able to grasp it, broaden our horizons, and serve the people, so that our work has true value.
    The third point is the lack of unity. From a small work unit to all nursing staff, the spirit of unity is not strong enough. Those who do administrative work often feel that the biggest problem is personnel transfer. If A and B do not get along, they are unwilling to work in the same unit. Even if the colleagues in one unit can cooperate, they are only willing to take care of the convenience of their own unit and do not pay attention to the promotion of the work of the entire group. It should be known that no matter how good an individual's work is, if it cannot be united with others, it is still worthless. Only when everyone unites and works hard can the achievements of the work be shown, and the effectiveness of nursing can be brought into play.
    Finally, I would like to encourage all nursing colleagues to make this year's "May 12th" a conscious festival, work harder in the future, learn more about all academics and ideas, unite to promote the future of our nursing profession, and practice the truth of "serving the people."
    (The End)

    今年护士节的几点感想
    林菊英
    每年的“五·一二”要庆祝护士节，每年的“五·一二”要开会登报的纪念南丁格尔女士创立护士教育与她的服务精神，然而在今年，北平解放了的今年，我们在此地纪念的意义是更深长更远大的。
    我个人是从事护业数年的一名小卒。每天按着定时的上下班，做些常规的护理工作。每年到“五·一二”随着一些护界前进呐喊一声“庆祝护士节”，然而讲老实话，我做的事只是尽责而已，谈不到对整个护业有何贡献，够不上真正为人民服务的水准，更不敢比我们的老鼻祖——南丁格尔女士的工作精神。可是年复一年的过去了，我也始终没有感觉没有警惕的做下去。今年，在北平的全面解放后，我从工作时接触到解放区的医护同志，从他们的努力学习实事求是的服务精神中得到了几点启示，感觉到一生个人过去的缺点，借这机会把他们列举出来作为自我检讨，希望能抛砖引玉，因此提起其他护界同人与我有同样错误的，大家一齐警醒，彼此勉励共同发扬我们护士真正的服务精神。
    第一点我个人感到的缺点是固守岗位不求前进。这一点我也考察到许多同事如此。从学校毕业后便把一切书籍束之高阁。甚至于对新近的医护杂志也不再参阅，每天除了做常规工作以外，再不追求新的知识。实际上这种做法是错误了。因为护理工作离不开医学，而医学的知识是日新月异、永无止境的。我们一日不向前追就会落后，结果一定不能真正做到了进步的护理工作。所以我希望今后我们护界能有组织的彼此研究、探索，不断的学习新知识，使护界前辈的名衔不仅代表了某个人的年龄、资望，而更是他的学识与前进。
    第二点是对现代政治、社会的认识不清楚。因为护士职业在过去社会中是比较清高的，于是养成了大多数护界同人对时事的淡漠。国民党也好，共产党也好，医护工作总要维持的，技术人员总要留用的，有这点技能还愁没饭吃，于是抛开一些时代知识而只谈本行。实际上，政治与社会的变化足以影响到个人甚至于整个护士职业的前途。我们对于自己所处的时代不仅要认清，而且要能把握，要放远我们的视线，为人民服务，那么我们的工作才有真正的价值。
    第三点是团结力的不足，小而至一个工作单位，大而至所有的护界人员，团结的精神都不够强。做行政的人往往感到最大的问题是人事调动，甲乙不和便不肯在一个单位里做。即使一个单位中的同人都能合作，也只肯顾到自己单位的方便而不注意整个团体工作的推行。要知个人的工作无论多优良，如果不能与别人团结，仍是毫无价值的。只有上下一齐团结努力才能表现出工作的成绩，同时也发挥了护理的实效。
    最后，我谨望诸护界同人彼此共勉，以今年“五·一二”做一个自觉的节日，对今后的工作更努力，对一切的学术、思想多学习，团结起来光大我们护业的前程，实践到“为人民服务”的真理。        
    （完）
