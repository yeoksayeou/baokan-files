The Significance of Performing "March of the Democratic Youth"
Wang Ji

Ever since the Chinese revolution defined the two distinct goals of struggle: "anti-imperialism" and "anti-feudalism," the Chinese youth and student groups, starting from the "May Fourth Movement," have been fighting for these dual political tasks. Especially after the start of the People's Liberation War, the student movements in major cities within the Kuomintang-controlled areas became widespread. The most acute and extensive development was the student movement in Beiping from "May 20th" to "June 2nd" in 1947. This movement effectively dealt a severe blow to the reactionary regime, which was gradually collapsing. The play "March of the Democratic Youth" fully reflects the true situation of this period and provides a correct summary of the past movements.

The role of intellectuals in the people's revolution has long been affirmed: "They can play a vanguard and bridge role in the current stage of the Chinese revolution. The overseas student movement before the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement of 1919, the May 30th Movement of 1925, and the December 9th Movement of 1935 are clear examples. In particular, the vast majority of poorer intellectuals and semi-intellectuals can join and support the revolution alongside the workers and peasants. The widespread dissemination and acceptance of Marxism-Leninism in China also began among intellectuals and young students. The organization of revolutionary forces and the construction of the revolutionary cause cannot succeed without the participation of revolutionary intellectuals. However, before intellectuals integrate with the revolutionary struggles of the masses and resolve to serve the interests of the people and make their lives mass-oriented, their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering." (The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party). At the same time, most general intellectuals and young students come from the petty bourgeoisie and therefore carry many petty-bourgeois shortcomings such as individualism, arrogance, and fanaticism. These shortcomings are also reflected in the student movements they conduct, and often because of these shortcomings, the movements suffer unnecessary losses and weaken their own strength. Thus, in one student movement after another, we have gradually gained experience and lessons, realizing how to strike the enemy more powerfully, and earnestly overcoming our shortcomings. Facing the "May Fourth Movement" of 1949, we should gather these valuable experiences and lessons to enable the vast number of young students to understand themselves more deeply, examine themselves, and determine their direction of serving the people, especially serving the workers and peasants, and to temper themselves in practical mass struggles.

Therefore, we want to present "March of the Democratic Youth" to the people of Beiping as a gift to commemorate the "May Fourth Movement."

"March of the Democratic Youth" can be said to depict the heroic deeds of the young student groups who, under the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which brought hunger, fear, and a lack of means of survival, raised the banner of democracy and tenaciously fought against the executioners who opposed freedom and democracy—the loyal running dogs of imperialism and the feudal forces—based on true events and figures from the May 20th period. At the same time, it raises the main biases in the student movement, examines their certain social roots, and offers appropriate criticisms. Most importantly, it suggests ways to solve the problems. Therefore, this will inevitably play a certain educational role and provide very valuable materials for the transformation of the vast number of intellectuals.

"Unity is strength," this is a very clear and powerful slogan in the student movement. But how to unite the majority, how to win over the masses with insufficient ideological awareness, and how to win over the middle elements to make the movement more widespread and in-depth? This is a very important question. Treating the masses as puppets or useless figureheads will not only weaken our own strength but also open up ground for the enemy to carry out sabotage. To win the struggle, we must unite the broad masses and rely on the masses. The masses are the main force of the movement, and revolution cannot succeed solely on the strength of a few progressive elements. In particular, we should always be aware of their ideological situation, organize them, and help them progress. Only when our own ranks are united completely and tightly can the enemy become completely isolated and helpless.

Of course, on the basis of unity, the purpose of the movement is undoubtedly to strike at the enemy. However, some radical elements often focus more on satisfying their own emotional venting and fail to consider the overall interests of the revolution, putting forward some overly leftist slogans. This kind of leftist adventurism, because it ignores the enemy's strength or underestimates the enemy's strength, will inevitably give the enemy time and opportunities to take advantage of the situation, bringing serious losses to the revolution. Especially under the encouragement of victory, one should be careful not to let victory cloud one's mind. The petty-bourgeoisie's fanaticism and acute illness precisely illustrate their vacillation. Similarly, in the low tide of the revolution, it is easy to shrink back under the coercion of reactionary forces and fail to correctly estimate one's own strength.

Therefore, uniting the majority and winning over the middle elements is not a matter of unprincipled "winning over" and "uniting." It is necessary to launch a strict ideological struggle, first to expand our own front and completely isolate the enemy, and then to conduct ideological education to prevent all left and right deviations, so as to ensure that steps are consistent, firepower is concentrated, avoid all unnecessary sacrifices, give the enemy a more fatal blow, and strive for absolute victory.

In addition, conducting strict criticism and self-criticism is one of the conditions for making progress.

From the above situation, we can know that the victory of the student democratic movement is possible only under the correct leadership of the Party—the leadership of the proletariat. In other words, the victory of the student democratic movement is the result of the Party's ideological struggle and ideological education.

Through this play, we can see even more that there is not much room for maneuver between democracy and anti-democracy, between truth and darkness, and between the broad people's democratic movement and the remnants of feudal forces. In sharp struggles and revolutionary upsurges, neutrality is impossible.

In the new revolutionary situation, due to the unprecedented victory of the people's liberation cause, and because the People's Liberation Army has liberated Tianjin and Beiping and has crossed the Yangtze River, the young students in many cities have transformed from being oppressed to becoming a force directly supporting the revolution. Today, the nature of the Chinese revolution is a new democratic revolution, the purpose of which is to completely eliminate imperialism and the remnants of feudal forces, to eliminate its bad influences in culture, art, and other aspects, and to build a new society led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Uniting the petty-bourgeois intellectuals is still necessary. Moreover, all science and culture should serve the people, especially the workers and peasants. How intellectuals can combine theory with practice, eliminate all the inferior qualities of the petty bourgeoisie, humbly learn from the workers and peasants, and enthusiastically serve them is by no means a matter of unprincipled "accommodation." The important thing is still to conduct ideological education and ideological struggle.

Of course, it is a long and arduous process for intellectuals to transform themselves into revolutionary intellectuals. Here we offer some opinions, all of which are experiences and lessons stained with blood and tears.

——This is also the reason why we are performing "March of the Democratic Youth."

    演出“民主青年进行曲”的意义
    王季
    自从中国的革命规定了：“反帝”“反封建”两个鲜明的斗争目标以后，从“五四”开始，中国的青年学生群就一直地为着这双重的政治任务作斗争，尤其是在人民解放战争开始以后，在国民党统治区的各大城市的学生运动更是普遍地展开而表现得最尖锐与发展得最广泛的一次，便是一九四七年在北平从“五、二○”到“六、二”这一阶段的学生运动，这次运动曾经是有效地给逐渐走向崩溃的反动政权以狠命的一棒。“民主青年进行曲”这一剧作就充分地反映了这一阶段的真实情况，把过去的运动作了一个正确的总结。
    知识分子在人民革命中所起的作用早就被肯定了，“他们在现阶段的中国革命中能够起着先锋的与桥梁的作用。辛亥革命前的留学生运动，一九一九年的五四运动，一九二五年的五卅运动，一九三五年的一二九运动，就是显明的例证。尤其是广大的比较穷苦的知识分子与半知识分子，能够和工农一道，参加和拥护革命。马克思列宁主义的思想在中国的广大的传播和接受，首先也是在知识分子与青年学生中。革命力量的组织与革命事业的建设，离开革命的知识分子的参加，是不能成功的。但是知识分子在其未与民众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为民众利益服务并使其生活群众化之时，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”（中国革命与中国共产党），同时，一般的知识分子、青年学生大都出身于小资产阶级，因而就带着许多小资产阶级的缺点，个人主义、自大性、狂热病等等，这些也就表现在他们所进行的学生运动中，而且常常因为这些缺点，使得运动蒙受了不应有的损失，削弱自己的力量，这样在一次又一次的学生运动中我们是逐渐地取得了经验和教训，认识到怎样更有力的打击敌人。认真地克服自己的缺点。面对着一九四九年的“五四”，我们应该把这些宝贵的经验教训汇集起来，让广大的青年学生，更深刻认识自己，检查自己，确定自己为人民服务特别是为工农服务的方向，在实际的群众斗争中去锻炼自己。
    为此，我们要把“民主青年进行曲”呈献在北平人民面前，作为纪念“五四”的献礼。
    “民主青年进行曲”可以说是根据五、二○时真实的事件、人物，描绘出青年学生群在饥饿、恐惧、无法生存的蒋匪帮黑暗统治下，高举起民主的旗帜，坚强不屈地和反自由反民主的刽子手—帝国主义忠实走狗，封建势力坚持斗争的英勇事迹。同时提出了学运中主要的偏向，检查出它的一定社会根源，适当的批评。并且最重要的是提示出解决问题的途径。所以这个必然会起着一定的教育作用。对于广大知识分子的改造问题提供了很宝贵的材料。
    “团结就是力量”，这是学运中一个很明确很有力的号召。但是如何团结大多数，如何争取思想觉悟不够高的群众，如何争取中间分子，而使得运动更广泛和深入呢？这是一个很重要的问题。把群众当傀儡、当阿斗，其结果不仅是削弱了自己的力量。并且正是给敌人开辟了做破坏工作的地盘。要争取斗争胜利，就必须团结广大群众，依靠群众。群众是运动的主要力量，革命不是单凭少数进步分子的力量可以成功的。尤其应该随时明了他们的思想情况，组织他们，帮助他们进步。只有自己的队伍团结得完整而严密时，敌人才能成为完全的孤立无援。
    当然，在团结的基础上，运动的目的不成问题是为了打击敌人。但是一部分过激分子常常较多的为了满足自己感情上的发泄，不能照顾到革命的全盘利益，而提出一些过左的口号。这种左倾的冒险主义，因为忽视了敌人的力量，或者过低估计了敌人的力量；必然会给予敌人以乘隙的时间和机会，给革命带来严重的损失。特别是在胜利的鼓舞下，应该注意不要让胜利冲昏了脑子。小资产阶级的狂热病急性病也正是说明了他们的动摇性。同样在革命低潮时，又容易在反动势力胁迫下畏缩，不能正确的估计自己本身的力量。
    因此团结大多数，争取中间分子并非无原则的“争取”和“团结”。这是必须展开严格的思想斗争，首先是扩大自己的战线，完全孤立敌人。然后是进行思想教育，防止一切左的和右的偏向。因而使得步调一致，火力集中，避免一切不必要的牺牲，给敌人以更致命的打击，争取绝对的胜利。
    此外进行严格的批评与自我批评也是取得进步的条件之一。
    从上述的情形中，我们可以知道，学生民主运动的胜利是在党的正确领导——无产阶级领导下才有可能。换句话说，学生民主运动的胜利是党进行思想斗争思想教育的结果。
    通过这个戏，我们更可以看出，在民主与反民主，在真理与黑暗，在广大人民民主运动与封建残余势力之间，是没有多少回旋的余地的。在斗争尖锐与革命高潮下，中立是不可能的。
    在新的革命形势下，由于人民解放事业空前的胜利，由于人民解放军解放了平津，并且已横过长江，很多城市的青年学生已经从被压迫的地位转化为对革命直接支援的力量。而今天中国革命的性质是新民主主义的革命，目的在彻底的全部的肃清帝国主义和封建残余势力，肃清它的文化、艺术各方面的恶影响，建设一个以无产阶级为领导，工农联盟为主体的新社会。团结小资产阶级知识分子仍旧是必要的。而且一切科学文化都应为人民，特别是工农服务的。知识分子如何把理论与实践结合起来，消除一切小资产阶级的劣根性，虚心向工农学习和热忱地为他们服务。这里又决不是一个无原则的“迁就”的问题，重要的仍旧在于进行思想教育和思想斗争。
    知识分子改造自己成为革命的知识分子，当然是一个长期而艰苦的过程。这里我们提供一些意见，而且都是血泪斑斑的经验和教训。
    ——这也是我们演出民主青年进行曲的理由。
