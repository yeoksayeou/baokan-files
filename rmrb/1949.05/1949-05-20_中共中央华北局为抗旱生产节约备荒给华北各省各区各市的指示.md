According to current reports, most areas of North China experienced little snow last winter and a lack of rain this spring, resulting in a severe drought. The cotton-producing areas are particularly affected, with cotton and peanuts not yet fully sown. As for other grains, most have been sown in mountainous areas due to early planting habits, while in the drought-stricken plains, most have not yet been sown. Furthermore, in about sixty counties in Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, and Taihang areas, *Arctoscelis* and flea beetles are seriously damaging wheat seedlings. Aphids and locust nymphs have appeared in some areas, and some counties in Taihang and Taiyue have suffered wind and frost damage. Jaundice has been discovered in some counties in Central and Southern Hebei. The affected wheat seedlings are generally withered, and even in non-disaster areas, the plants are generally short with small ears. Therefore, a reduction in this year's wheat production is a certainty. The central issue now is how to mitigate the disaster caused by this poor harvest, to quickly plant cotton and peanuts, and to complete spring plowing and sowing in areas with rainfall. Otherwise, it will not only lead to widespread food shortages and famine but also affect the supply of raw materials to urban industries, endangering industrial production and weakening the strength to support the front lines. Recently, on the night of May 10th, North China experienced widespread rainfall, but the rainfall in the cotton-producing areas of the plains was minimal. The entire Party must be urgently mobilized, taking drought resistance, production, saving, and famine preparation as the overriding central task, fully leveraging all the successful experiences from the fight against drought and insect plagues during the Anti-Japanese War. Cadres should take the lead and personally take action, overcome difficulties, and carry out the following tasks:

(1) Party committees and people's governments at all levels should immediately organize cadres to go to the countryside, patiently mobilizing the masses in areas with little rain or severe drought to overcome the idea of waiting for rain and relying on heaven. They must fight against drought and insect plagues, believing that "human determination can also conquer nature." Organize all forces to seize the opportunity of moisture to rush-plant or dry-plant while fighting the drought. Cotton-producing areas must use every possible means to rush-plant cotton and peanuts around the time of Xiaoman (around May 21st), planting as much as possible. Make the greatest possible use of large and small water conservancy facilities, organize reasonable water use, and fully utilize the effectiveness of water conservancy. In areas with more rainfall, organize mutual assistance to complete autumn grain sowing in a timely manner, with deep plowing and meticulous cultivation to achieve increased production. Letting things drift is wrong and harmful.

	North China experiences drought in nine out of ten years, and we are threatened by drought almost every year. For long-term planning, we should do our best to build wells and canals wherever possible. The North China People's Government can issue more water conservancy loans.

(2) During the spring plowing period, we must strictly conserve manpower. Except for necessary war service, requisitioning labor should be strictly prohibited. Although the North China People's Government issued clear orders early on, reports from various places indicate that many localities and troops are still illegally requisitioning labor. People's governments at all levels should conduct thorough inspections and resolutely stop this practice, and those who violate the rules should be punished.

(3) In the drought resistance movement, based on past experience, we often neglect flood prevention. Last year, Central and Southern Hebei experienced drought first and then flooding, leading to waterlogging disasters. This lesson must be remembered. In addition to large-scale river management projects organized uniformly by the North China Water Conservancy Bureau, local governments should organize the masses along the rivers in a timely and planned manner to reinforce dikes and repair dangers, preventing floods.

(4) To eliminate locust nymphs and various insect pests, in addition to fully leveraging the locust-catching experience during the Anti-Japanese War and promptly swatting them, it is now possible to make greater use of scientific methods for prevention and control. Agricultural organs at all levels should, as far as possible, prepare scientific prevention and control methods, educate the masses, and take it a step further.

(5) With reduced wheat production and delayed spring sowing, a period of scarcity between the summer and autumn harvests is inevitable, especially in areas severely ravaged by the long-term rule of the Kuomintang. Therefore, our organizations, troops, and groups at all levels should immediately formulate measures to practice strict economy, reduce food consumption, accurately calculate, and eliminate waste. Mobilize the masses in drought-stricken areas to prepare for late planting and increased planting of early-maturing grains. Financial, trade, and cooperative organizations of people's governments at all levels should plan for grain allocation and prepare seeds for late planting to avoid delays in temporary allocation.

(6) Many places are experiencing outbreaks of human and animal plagues, which are likely to continue due to lack of snow and rain. It is necessary to strengthen epidemic prevention and medical work. We have better health and medical conditions than in the past, and health organs at all levels should make full use of them. Recently, the North China and Northeast epidemic prevention teams in Chahar carried out preventive injections and treatment of 167,200 heads of infected cattle, preventing the rapid spread of cattle plague. This is worth learning from.

(7) The relationship between cities and the countryside is close. If agricultural production suffers, it will be difficult for cities to obtain sufficient food and raw materials, and the purchasing power of farmers will decrease, resulting in a lack of sales for industrial products. This situation is already quite serious. Therefore, the people of the city must provide strong assistance to the farmers, producing what the farmers need urgently and striving to reduce costs. The government should mobilize various talents in the city to go to the countryside as much as possible to serve in increasing agricultural production, preventing insect pests, and preventing epidemics, and advocate appropriate saving of food. All staff members of urban organs should practice strict economy in manpower and materials, cherish public property, eliminate extravagance and waste, and promote a simple style.

The key to overcoming difficulties and defeating disasters lies in the Party's ability to truly grasp the working principle of "taking production as the overriding central task, with all other work revolving around production," and to stipulate specific work steps and organize regular inspections. At present, we should focus all our efforts on leading the rush planting, and formulate specific plans for the summer harvest, summer planting, summer tax collection, and disaster prevention and famine preparation, communicate and deploy them in depth, and combine other work with this to the best of our ability. It is imperative not to relax the work of drought resistance, production, saving, and famine preparation due to other work. We have rich successful experience in organizing production for disaster relief. I believe that we can overcome disasters and mitigate the disaster. Some areas have recently done very well. For example, some places in Central and Southern Hebei have organized rush mutual assistance, digging wells to carry water for planting, and using river water, canals, and well water to promote waterwheels for irrigation, achieving great results. Central Hebei alone has ensured the timely planting of more than 100,000 mu of land, Anxin County has irrigated 48,000 mu, and Guan County has irrigated more than 16,000 mu. In Julu's third district, watering and hoeing wheat eliminated insect plagues on more than 10,000 mu. Taihang and Northern Henan have carried out large-scale locust eradication in about 500 villages. In Southern Hebei, locust nymphs were discovered in Qiu County's third and fourth districts and were eliminated in two days. The Central Hebei 11th District organized a work team to mobilize all farm personnel to lead the masses in fighting the *Arctoscelis*. Chahar stopped the rapid spread of cattle plague. Taihang launched a widespread spring plowing inspection movement in late April. Central Hebei launched a well-digging movement. Southern Hebei organized a large-scale drought resistance and rush planting of cotton movement. In Daming County alone, 500 cadres went to the countryside. These are all achievements gained in the fight against disasters, and all localities should learn from them. However, judging from reports from various places, some cadres are still entangled in ending land reform, rectifying the Party, evaluating production, and other work, failing to shift their focus to production, and adopting a bureaucratic style of simply calling for action without organizing inspection. This must be corrected immediately.

Thanks to the Party's strong leadership, last year we were able to fight against various disasters, mitigate the disaster, and achieve a 70% harvest in the entire region. After the autumn, we successfully completed the tasks of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, and the results of autumn plowing and wheat planting exceeded those of previous years. This year, under the unprecedented favorable conditions of the complete liberation of the entire North China, we should have more confidence in overcoming difficulties and defeating disasters.

　　中共中央华北局为抗旱生产节约备荒给华北各省各区各市的指示
    根据现在所得报告，华北大部地区，去冬少雪，今春缺雨，已呈严重旱象，尤以产棉区为最甚，棉花花生尚未完全播种，其他谷物，除山地有早种习惯大部已下种外，平原旱区则大多尚未下种。又冀中、冀南、太行约有六十县地区，发生火蛛子猿叶虫等，严重地危害麦苗，部分地区发生蚜虫蝗蝻，太行太岳某几县遭风灾冻灾，冀中冀南某几县发现黄疸。受灾麦苗普遍枯萎，非灾区亦一般株低穗小，故今年麦产减收已成定局。目前的中心问题是如何挽救此歉收所造成的灾象，突击点种棉花花生，在落雨地区突击完成春耕下种，否则，不仅将酿成普遍的缺粮灾荒，且必影响对城市工业原料之供给，危及工业生产及削弱支援前线的力量。最近五月十日夜间华北地区普遍落雨，但平原产棉区雨量很小。全党必须紧急动员起来，以抗旱生产节约备荒为压倒一切的中心任务，充分发挥抗战期间与旱灾虫灾作斗争的一切成功经验，干部带头亲自动手，克服困难，进行下列工作：
    （一）各级党委和各级人民政府，应立即组织干部下乡，在少雨或苦旱地区耐心动员群众，克服等雨靠天吃饭的想头，要与旱灾虫灾作斗争“人定亦可胜天”，组织一切力量，趁湿抢种或抗旱点种干种，产棉区要用尽一切可能的办法在小满前后突击点种棉花花生，多种一亩得一亩；尽可能地利用大小水利，组织合理使水，充分发挥水利效用。在落雨较多地区，组织互助，及时突击完成秋粮下种，深耕细作，求得增产。放任自流是错误的有害的。
    华北十年九旱，我们几乎年年受旱灾威胁，为长期打算，凡可能凿井开渠的地方，应尽力兴办，华北人民政府可增发水利贷款。
    （二）春耕期间，必须严格节省民力，除必要的战勤外，应严禁支差，华北人民政府虽早有明令，但据各地报告，仍有不少地方和部队非法支差，各级人民政府应深入检查，切实制止，违者应予处罚。
    （三）抗旱运动中，根据往年经验，往往疏于防水，去年冀中冀南就是先旱后涝，积水成灾，此教训必须记取。除大的治河工程由华北水利机关统一组织外，各地方政府应及时地有计划地组织沿河群众，培堤修险，防止水患。
    （四）扑灭蝗蝻及各种虫灾，除应充分发挥抗战期间捕蝗经验及时扑打外，现在有可能更多的利用科学方法防治，各级农业机关应尽可能地筹办科学防治和科学扑灭的办法，教育群众，提高一步。
    （五）麦既减产歉收，春耕播种亦多误时，夏秋间青黄不接将是必然的现象，特别在国民党长期统治摧残特甚的地区。因此我各级机关部队团体应立即订出厉行节约，减少食粮，精确核算，消灭滥费的办法。并动员群众，在旱区准备晚种多种早熟谷物。各级人民政府财政贸易合作机关应对粮食调度及准备晚种籽预有筹划，以免临时调度不来。
    （六）很多地方人畜瘟疫流行，由于少雪缺雨，势将继续发生，必须加强防疫与医疗工作。我们已有比以往较好的卫生医疗条件，各级卫生机关应充分加以运用。最近华北与东北的防疫队在察北预防注射及治疗疫牛共十六万七千二百余头，制止了猛烈蔓延的牛瘟，是值得学习的。
    （七）城市与乡村关系密切，农产如果歉收，则城市很难得到充分的食粮与生产原料的供给，农民购买力降低，则工业产品将缺乏销路，目前此种情况已相当严重。因此，城市人民必须予农民以大力协助，生产农民所必需急需的东西，力求减低成本。政府应尽可能地动员城市各种人才下乡，为增进农业生产防虫防疫而服务，并提倡适当地节省粮食。城市一切机关工作人员，更应厉行节约人力物力，爱护公物，祛除铺张浪费，发扬朴素作风。
    克服困难，战胜灾荒的关键，在于党能够切实掌握“以生产为压倒一切的中心任务，其他工作均应围绕着生产来进行，”的工作方针，并规定出具体的工作步骤和组织经常的检查。当前应以全力领导突击下种，并定出夏收夏种夏征及防灾备荒的具体计划，深入传达布置，其他工作量力结合来作。切不可因其他工作而放松抗旱生产节约备荒的工作。我们有丰富的组织起来生产救灾的成功经验，相信一定能够战胜灾荒，减轻灾情。最近有些地区作得也很好，如冀中冀南有些地方组织突击互助，挖井担水点种及利用河流水渠水井推广水车施行浇种，获得很大成绩，仅冀中就保证了十余万亩土地及时下种，安新一县就浇地四万八千亩，＠南一县就浇地一万六千余亩。巨鹿三区用浇水锄麦消灭了一万余亩的虫灾，太行豫北约五百个村庄之大举剿蝗，冀南邱县三四区发现蝗蝻两天打完，冀中十一分区组织工作队动员所有农场人员，领导群众与火蛛子作斗争，察哈尔制止猛烈蔓延之牛瘟，太行于四月下旬发动普遍的春耕检查运动，冀中展开挖土井运动，冀南组织大规模抗旱抢种点种棉花运动，大名一县就有五百干部下乡，这些都是与灾害做斗争获得的成绩，各地均应向他们学习。但从各地报告看来，还有部分干部存在着纠缠于结束土改整党评产量等工作转不过弯子来，忽视以生产为中心的偏向，和只号召不组织检查的官僚主义作风，必须立即纠正。
    由于党的强有力的领导，去年我们曾能够和各种灾害作斗争，减轻了灾情，获得全区七成收成。秋后又胜利地完成了秋收秋耕种麦的任务，而且秋耕种麦成绩超过往年。今年在华北全境完全解放的空前有利条件下，应更有信心地克服困难，战胜灾荒。  　　　五月十九日
