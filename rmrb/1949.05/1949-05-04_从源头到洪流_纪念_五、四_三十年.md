    From Source to Torrent – In Commemoration of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement
    Hu Feng
    In 1913, Lenin, the revolutionary mountain eagle, pointed to Asia and issued a resounding instruction to the world, especially to the proletariat of Europe.
    He pointed out that in addition to the common-sense truth that Europe is advanced and Asia is backward, it is necessary to further see the "bitter truth" that Europe is backward and Asia is advanced.
    On the one hand—
    "Civilized advanced Europe, with its highly developed technology, rich culture, and comprehensive constitution, has entered a historical period in which the ruling bourgeoisie, fearing the growing and strengthened proletariat, maintains all that is backward, decadent, and medieval... Europe is currently advanced not because of the bourgeoisie, but against the bourgeoisie's will, because only the proletariat is making the millions of people striving for a happy future grow stronger day by day, only it maintains the psychology of relentlessly hating backwardness, hating barbarism, hating privilege, hating slavery, and hating the phenomenon of human humiliation of man, and spreads this psychology."
    And Asia? —
    Powerful democratic movements are growing, expanding, and consolidating everywhere in Asia. There the bourgeoisie still oppose the reactionary forces together with the people. Hundreds of millions of people are awakening, tending towards light and freedom. How happy this world movement should make all awakened workers who know that democracy is the necessary path to achieving a collective system. How much sympathy should all sincere democrats show to young Asia!
    And "advanced" Europe? It plunders China and helps the enemies of China's democracy and freedom!...
    "The entire ruling power of Europe, the entire European bourgeoisie, is in alliance with all medieval reactionary forces in China."
    Five years later, in the second year of the great revolution that shook the world, when the proletariat in Russia, led by the peasants, destroyed the Tsar's system of servitude, in 1918, revolutionary thoughts awakened the latent demands of the Chinese people. The national democratic movement shook off the thick fog of false "democracy" of scholars, workers, merchants, businessmen, constitutionalists, parliamentarians, and the rule of law, which had been troubling it. The old feudal China felt unprecedented joy and unprecedented pain from its deepest depths. The Chinese people's first bugle call, "Diary of a Madman," was published. That was a bloody declaration of war against the old feudal China, expressing a resolute attitude of irreconcilable opposition to the old feudal China. To the future and the present, it raised the accusation of "man eating man," and to the present and the future, it issued the order to "save the children." In the same year, Lu Xun also published sixteen essays, each of which was a ruthless assassination of feudalism and a deep encouragement to the working people.
    In this way, the people's revolutionary faction on the ideological front began a leaping assault. And thought, when it is a sincere reflection of mature historical demands, can quickly develop into material force. By the following year, the heroic May Fourth Movement broke out. The May Fourth Movement was the first great battle created by this leaping assault that shook the whole of China. It not only made the torrent of ideological revolution surge forward, but it also brought together the thousands of tributaries of this torrent to the two comprehensive goals of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. This was a great ideological revolution that surged towards social revolution. Lu Xun himself later criticized the reformists for "beautifying it" and calling it the "New Culture Movement."
    Looking back today, the revolutionary thought of that time, including the slogan "labor is sacred," was within the scope of bourgeois demands in terms of the social practice it wanted to strive for, but in its internal source, it profoundly accepted the call of the Russian Revolution and was based on the working people.
    Lu Xun himself declared at the time that the Russian Revolution was "the dawn of the new century," and he called on the Chinese people to "raise their heads" towards this dawn.
    And another heroic assault soldier, Li Dazhao, also clearly declared that "the victory of Bolshevism is the victory of the new spirit of common consciousness in the minds of all human beings in the twentieth century."
    Therefore, the ideological revolution of the people's revolutionary faction was not only firm in its position from the very beginning, but also had a clear banner. Thus, at first, it united and resisted the democratic reformists on one hand, and later it occasionally united but constantly exposed the hypocrisy, compromising nature, and even reactionary nature of the reformists, striving to advance.
    Needless to say, the ideological revolution and even the social struggle at that time were undertaken by intellectuals, especially young intellectuals. They were the first to bring the spark and immediately burned themselves. However, first, this ideological revolution was originally a reflection of the latent demands of the working people; second, this revolutionary thought then penetrated into the working people and turned into the main force of practical struggle. In 1921, the vanguard of the proletariat, and at the same time the general staff of the broad oppressed people, the Communist Party of China, was formally established.
    For thirty years, the people's revolutionary struggle has gone through many magnificent and perilous waves. As far as revolutionary intellectuals are concerned, the spark they imported immediately ignited the flames of revolutionary struggle among the working people, and these flames in turn burned the intellectuals themselves, constantly testing them. For thirty years, the arduous and fiery practical revolutionary struggle has also been a process of ideological struggle and ideological development. After the spark of thought was thrown into real society and turned into the flames of struggle, at this time, what is called thought must not only have the high level of dedication and firmness, but also turn the entire historical reality and the content of struggle, which are closely related and constantly evolving, into its own flesh and blood. From here emerged the incomparably rich and incomparably arduous actual process of combining with the working people. For thirty years, all kinds of changes have appeared in this process. Some just wanted to step in and retreated in despair, returning to the feudal homeland or the comprador's office; some ran away after only a few battles, presenting the heads of their comrades to the enemy; some learned a set of ancestral skills of "acting nihilists," forgetting that the dedicated struggle and the business of making money are absolutely contradictory; some were full of confidence, but just closed their eyes and waved their axes, harming the people and falling themselves, making the annals of revolutionary history, which were already enough, even more filled with bloody and tearful chronicles... However, the revolutionary struggle is persisting and advancing, the working people are awakening and growing; thought, it must maintain that high level of dedication and firmness, it must turn the entire historical reality and the content of struggle, which are closely related and constantly evolving, into its own flesh and blood. The incomparably rich social reality and the incomparably vivid revolutionary experience must crystallize; sure enough, for more than ten years, the working people of the world have been surprised to discover that Mao Zedong Thought has achieved concrete formation, has won a relative advantage, and even has won an overwhelming victory.
    The victory of thought comes from practical struggle, but it in turn powerfully guides practical struggle, promotes practical struggle, and finally guarantees the victory of practical struggle. Today, on a national scale, an overwhelming victory has been achieved, and a complete victory is about to be achieved. The revolution has crushed the semi-feudal and semi-colonial upper ruling institutions, and is repelling the offensive of the reactionary forces and imperialism, which have been "in alliance" for nearly a century.
    Of course, now it has only broken the ruling political institutions, and has only begun the process of economic transformation initially or partially, however, after this victory, and only after this victory, can the economic transformation be fully implemented, and the cultural revolution be carried out in depth, so that countless outstanding sons and daughters and more than 400 million working people can dedicate sweat or even blood to transform the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China into a happy and equal people's motherland heading towards a socialist future.
    On such a day, when we look back at the original source of this revolutionary torrent, how beautiful and moving it is!
    Thirty-six years ago, Lenin, the great pioneer of the working people of the world, had already made a guarantee to us—
    "...The entire young Asia, that is, the hundreds of millions of workers in Asia, have the proletariat in various civilized countries as their reliable ally. No force in the world can stop this proletariat from liberating the people of Europe and the people of Asia together."
    Thirty-one years ago, the year before the May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun, the great pioneer of the Chinese people, summarized that first year of battle, and used that to guarantee the bloody struggle of the past thirty years—
    The road of life is progressive, always walking upwards along the inclined plane of an infinite spiritual triangle, and nothing can stop him.
    There are still many disharmonies that nature bestows on people, and there are still many instances of people shrinking back and regressing, but life never turns back because of this. No matter what darkness comes to prevent thought, what misery comes to attack society, what sins come to desecrate humanity, humanity's yearning for complete potential always steps forward on these iron caltrops.
    Life is not afraid of death, laughing and jumping in the face of death, stepping over the people who have perished and moving forward.
    What is a road? It is trampled out from a place where there is no road, and opened up from a place where there are only thorns.
    There was a road before, and there should always be a road forever.
    "The pioneers' calls have been resounding until today, the pioneers' songs have been resounding until today, and for us today, we feel that incomparably magnificent spiritual power even more."
    Today's young people are happy. This happiness is not only because the revolution has been victorious, and they will no longer endure the tragic encounters of the countless pioneer youth of the past thirty years. This happiness is especially because the great revolutionary thought has risen from the blockade, distortion, slander, suppression, etc., and shines on this land of the people, able to face it, accept it, and absorb it without hindrance, helping themselves to happily relieve the heavy burden of the past, hold on to the direction and throw themselves into the people's ranks. Today's young people are happy, although not only in getting rid of the past but especially on the road to the future, they will inevitably encounter difficulties, encounter grievances, and encounter setbacks, and must use great strength to endure and pass through them, however, compared to the countless pioneer youth of the past thirty years, the grievances they suffered in thought, the difficulties and pains they experienced, and the sacrifices they made, that is happy, too happy. Today's young people will cherish this happiness, make themselves more beautiful, more intelligent, and also stronger, make themselves one of the countless outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland, contribute strength, contribute sweat, and even blood to participate in the great but long-term and arduous process of transforming the motherland's historical project.

    从源头到洪流——纪念“五、四”三十年
    胡风
    一九一三年，革命的山鹰列宁，他指着亚洲向全世界的，特别是欧洲的无产阶级发出了洪钟一样的指示的声音。
    他指出，在欧洲先进而亚洲落后这常识的真理以外，须要进一步看出来欧洲是落后的而亚洲是先进的这一“含有苦味的真理”。
    一方面——
    “技术十分发达，文化丰富，宪法周备的文明先进的欧洲，已进到这样一个历史时期，此时统治的资产阶级因害怕增长强固起来的无产阶级，而维持一切落后的、衰亡的、中世纪的东西。……欧洲现时之所以先进，并不是因为有资产阶级，而是违反着资产阶级底意志，因为只有无产阶级才使争取幸福将来的百万大军日益增长起来，只有它才保持着无情地仇恨落后，仇恨野蛮，仇恨特权，仇恨奴隶制，仇恨人侮辱人现象的心理，并传布着这种心理。”
    而亚洲呢？——
    亚洲各处都有强大的民主运动增长，扩大，巩固起来。那里的资产阶级还同人民一块反对反动势力。数万万人觉醒起来，趋向于光明和自由。这个世界运动该使所有一切知道民主制度是达到集体制度所必经之路的觉悟工人多么欢喜啊。一切忠诚的民主主义者是对年轻的亚洲多么表示同情啊！
    而“先进的”欧洲呢？它掠夺中国，帮助中国民主自由底敌人！……
    “整个欧洲当权势力，整个欧洲资产阶级，都是与中国所有一切中世纪反动势力实行联盟的。”
    五年以后，在俄罗斯的无产阶级领导着农民摧毁了沙皇的奴役制度，那个震撼了全世界的大革命的第二年，一九一八，革命的思潮惊醒了中国人民底潜在要求，民族民主运动抖掉了一直在那里面苦闷着的科、工、商、贾、立宪、议会、法统等等虚伪的“民主主义”的浓雾，封建主义的旧中国从内部深处感到了前所未有的惊喜和前所未有的痛楚。中国人民底第一声冲锋号，“狂人日记”发表了。那是对于封建主义旧中国的血淋淋的战书，向封建主义旧中国表示了不能两立的决死的挑战态度。对将来和现在，它提出了“人吃人”的控告，对现在和将来，它发布了“救救孩子”的命令。在同一年，鲁迅还发表了十六篇杂文，那每一篇都是对于封建主义的无情的刺杀和对于劳动人民的深情的激励。
    就这样，思想战线上的人民革命派开始了跃进的突击。而思想，当它是成熟了的历史要求底真诚的反映的时候，就能够飞快地发展为物质力量。到第二年，英勇的五、四运动爆发了。五、四运动，是这跃进的突击所创造出来的，震撼了全中国的第一次大会战，它不但使思想革命的洪流汹涌澎湃地发展了开去，它还使这个洪流底千万支流汇合到反帝反封建这两个综合的目标上面。这是一个伟大的向社会革命突进的思想革命，鲁迅本人后来就曾经指斥过改良主义者们“美其名”地把它叫做“新文化运动”。
    今天回头看一看，当时的革命思想，连“劳动神圣”这口号也包括在内，在它所要争取的社会实践上说，都是在资产阶级性的要求以内的，但在它底内在的来源上，却深刻地接受了俄罗斯革命底号召，是以劳动人民为本位的。
    鲁迅本人当时明白地宣布过，俄罗斯革命是“新世纪的曙光”，他号召中国人民向这个曙光“抬起头”来。
    而另一个英勇的突击兵李大钊，也明白地宣布了“布尔塞维主义的胜利就是二十世纪世界人类人人心目中共同觉悟的新精神的胜利”。
    所以，人民革命派的思想革命，在一开始的当时，就不但立场坚定，而且旗帜鲜明。因而，最初是一面团结一面抵抗着民主改良派，后来是间或团结但却经常揭发改良派底虚伪性、妥协性、以至反动性而争取前进的。
    不用说，当时的思想革命以至社会斗争，是由知识分子，特别是青年知识分子所担当的。他们最初地接来了火种，马上就把自己燃烧了起来。然而，第一，这思想革命原来是劳动人民底潜在要求底反映，第二，这革命的思想接着就深入了劳动人民里面，化成了实践的战斗主力。到一九二一年，无产阶级底先锋队，同时又是广大的被压迫人民底参谋总部的中国共产党，正式成立了。
    三十年以来，人民革命的斗争经过了许多次雄壮而惊险的波澜。就革命的知识分子说，他们所输入的火种马上在劳动人民中间烧起了革命斗争的烈焰，这烈焰又反转来燃烧着知识分子自己，使他们不断地受着考验。三十年以来，艰苦而火热的实践的革命斗争，同时又正是一个思想斗争和思想发展的过程。思想的火种，投进了现实社会，化成了斗争的烈焰以后，这时候，被叫做思想的，不但得具有献身的高度坚贞性，而且还得把彼此息息相关，时时新陈演变的全部历史现实和斗争内容化为自己的血肉，从这里就出现了无比丰富也无比艰苦的，和劳动人民结合的实际过程。三十年以来，在这个过程上面呈现了形形色色的变化。有的刚刚想踏进脚来就废然而返，回到了封建的故园或买办的写字间里面，有的战不数合就跑着把战友底头颅向敌人呈缴上去，有的学会了一套祖传的“做戏的虚无党”的本领，忘记了献身的斗争和赚钱的生意是绝对相反的两回事，有的满怀自信，但只是闭起眼睛挥舞着板斧，伤害了人民也跌倒了自己，使革命史上原来已经够多，现在更加多出了血泪斑斑的纪事……。然而，革命斗争在坚持，在前进，劳动人民在觉醒，在成长；思想，它一定要保持那献身的高度坚贞性，它一定要把彼此息息相关，时时新陈演变的全部历史现实和斗争内容化为自己的血肉。无比丰富的社会实际和无比生动的革命经验一定要结晶；果然，十多年以来，全世界的劳动人民惊喜地发现了，毛泽东思想达到了具体的形成，争到了相对的优势，以至获得了压倒的胜利。
    思想底胜利由实践斗争而来，但它反过来就强有力地指导了实践斗争，促进了实践斗争，终于保证了实践斗争底胜利。今天，在全国的规模上，已经得到了压倒的胜利，马上就要得到完全的胜利。革命击溃了半封建半殖民地的上层统治机构，击退着反动势力和帝国主义“实行联盟”了近百年的攻势。
    当然，现在还只是打破了统治的政治机构，还只是初步地或部份地开始了经济改造的过程，然而，在这个胜利以后，而且只有在这个胜利以后，才能够全部地实行经济改造，深入地进行文化革命，使无数的优秀的儿女和四万万以上的劳动人民献出汗或者还要献出血来把半封建半殖民地的旧中国改造成一个走向社会主义前途的，幸福而平等的人民的祖国。
    在这样的今天，我们再回头看一看这革命洪流底最初的源头，那是多么美丽，多么使人感动！
    三十六年以前，全世界劳动人民底伟大的先驱者列宁已经向我们提出了保证——
    “……整个年轻的亚洲，即亚洲数万万劳动者，却有各文明国家里的无产阶级为其可靠的同盟军。世界上没有什么力量能阻止这个无产阶级把欧洲各国人民和亚洲各国人民一同解放出来的胜利。”
    三十一年以前，五四的前一年，中国人民底伟大的先驱者鲁迅，替那第一个战斗年度作了总结，用那替三十年以来的血的斗争提出了保证——
    生命的路是进步的，总是沿着无限的精神三角形的斜面向上走，什么都阻止他不得。
    自然赋与人们的不调和还很多，人们自己萎缩退步的也还很多，然而生命决不因此回头。无论什么黑暗来防范思潮，什么悲惨来袭击社会，什么罪恶来亵渎人道，人类的渴仰完全的潜力，总是踏了这些铁蒺藜向前进。
    生命不怕死，在死的面前笑着跳着，跨过了灭亡的人们向前进。
    什么是路？就是从没路的地方践踏出来的，从只有荆棘的地方开辟出来的。
    以前有路了，以后也该永远有路。
    “先驱者们底号声一直响到了今天，先驱者们底歌声一直响到了今天，对于今天的我们，更加感到了那无比雄壮的精神力量。”
    今天的青年们是幸福的。这幸福，不仅仅是因为革命胜利了，再不会忍受三十年以来的无数的先驱的青年们底悲痛的遭遇。这幸福，特别是因为伟大的革命思想从封锁、歪曲、侮蔑、压杀等等里面高升了起来，普照在这人民的土地上面，能够毫无阻碍地去正视它，接受它，吸收它，帮助自己愉快地解除过去深重的负担，把住方向投身到人民底战列里面。今天的青年们是幸福的，虽然不但在摆脱过去而且特别在走向将来的路程上还不免要遭到困难，遭到委屈，遭到错折，须得用大力去忍受，去通过，然而，比较过去三十年以来的无数无数的先驱的青年们，他们在思想上所受到的委屈，所经验的困难和痛苦，所付出的牺牲，那却是幸福的，过于幸福的了。今天的青年们会宝贵这个幸福，使自己更美丽，更智慧，也更坚强，使自己成为我们祖国底无数无数的优秀儿女里面的一员，付出力，付出汗，甚至要付血来参加到伟大的但却得通过长期的艰巨过程的改造祖国的历史工程里面。
      一九四九，五月三日，急就，在北平。
