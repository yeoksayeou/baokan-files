Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 20th: Reports from various sources: The British Labour Party Executive Committee announced on the 18th the expulsion of Labour Party left-wing Members of Parliament Zilliacus and Solley from the party. At the same time, Attlee ordered the dismissal of another five Labour MPs from their positions as Parliamentary Secretaries to ministers. Zilliacus, in a statement regarding his expulsion, said that he was being punished simply because he adhered to their campaign promises on foreign policy and attended the Paris World Peace Congress. He said that, in this way, the Labour Party Executive Committee officially declared that Labour MPs cannot fulfill their constitutional responsibilities and express their opinions in accordance with the promises they made in the election. The Labour government, from the very beginning, has abandoned its promises to the voters regarding a policy of peace, and now it has approved the North Atlantic Treaty, unconditionally surrendering to Churchill's war policy. If the Labour Party does not change its policy, it will fail in the general election next year. According to London political circles, the reason for Zilliacus's expulsion is also because the Labour Party's right-wing leadership group fears that he will lead the opposition to the government's policies at the Blackpool Labour Party Conference. As for the dismissal of the other five MPs, it is because they voted against the imperialist "Ireland Act," which confirms Britain's continued support for the reactionaries in Northern Ireland. According to Agence France-Presse, citing London political observers, this purge is only part of a general purge plan. The Labour Party's right-wing leaders are attempting to suppress "rebellion" within the party against their reactionary policies. However, in the vote on the North Atlantic Aggression Pact in the House of Commons on the 12th, in addition to the two Communist MPs and four Labour Party left-wing MPs who voted against it, more than 100 Labour MPs abstained. In the vote on the "Ireland Act," 63 people voted against it. The Labour Party's reactionary leadership group will not be able to quell the "rebellion" of the Labour Party's lower-level members and the divisions among themselves as long as they continue their reactionary policies. This will ultimately lead them to bankruptcy.

　　妄图镇压党内不满现象
  　英工党“清洗”进步党员
    【新华社北平二十日电】各方报道：英国工党执行委员会于十八日宣布开除工党左翼议员齐里亚库斯及索莱的党籍。同时，艾德礼下令免除了另外五名工党议员的部长驻国会秘书的职务。齐里亚库斯就他被开除党籍一事发表谈话称，他之受到处分，只是因为他信守他们竞选中关于外交政策的诺言和参加了巴黎世界拥护和平大会。他说，这样，工党执行委员会正式宣告，工党议员不可以按照宪法尽他的责任，照他在选举中所作的保证表示意见。工党政府从一开始就背弃了他们对选民许下的关于和平政策的诺言，现在又批准了北大西洋公约，向邱吉尔的战争政策无条件投降。工党若不改变它的政策，它将在明年大选中失败。据伦敦政界表示，开除齐里亚库斯的原因还由于工党右翼领导集团害怕他将在布莱克浦尔工党大会上领导反对政府的政策。至于其他五名议员的被免职，则因他们投票反对帝国主义的“爱尔兰法案”，该案确定英国继续支持北爱尔兰的反动派。据法新社引伦敦政治观察家表示，这次清洗只是总清洗计划中的一部分。工党右翼领导分子企图以此来达到镇压党内对其反动政策“反叛”的目的。但是，在下院十二日表决北大西洋侵略公约中，除共产党议员二人及工党左翼议员四人投反对票外，工党议员弃权者达一百余名。在这次“爱尔兰法案”表决中，投反对票者达六十三名。工党反动领导集团一日继续他们的反动政策，就一日不能平息工党下层党员的“反叛”和他们自身之间的分裂。这将在最后把他们自己引上破产的道路。
