Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 14th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations Secretariat announced that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov protested to the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on May 7th about the Greek royalist fascist government's air force violating the Bulgarian border six times between April 30th and May 4th. On May 8th, Kolarov submitted another protest to the Political Committee, accusing the Greek royalist fascist army of invading Bulgarian territory near the village of Gorechevo on May 7th, resulting in one Bulgarian border guard being killed and one injured, and two other Bulgarian soldiers being captured by the invaders. The Greek royalist army took the body of the Bulgarian soldier to Greece and opened fire on a Bulgarian border patrol team that was ordered to search for the body. Kolarov vehemently protested "these continuous and dangerous provocative actions by Greece" and demanded the immediate release of the captured Bulgarian soldiers, the return of the deceased's body, severe punishment of those responsible for the incident, and compensation to the family of the deceased.

　　希保皇匪帮一再侵犯保边疆
  　保外长提严重抗议
    【新华社北平十四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国秘书处宣称：保加利亚外长科拉罗夫曾于五月七日向联大政委会抗议希腊保皇法西斯政府空军在四月三十日至五月四日期间六次侵犯保加利亚边疆的行为。五月八日，科拉罗夫又向政委会提交另一个抗议，控告希腊保皇法西斯军于五月七日在哥列切伏村附近侵入保加利亚领土，结果致使保加利亚边防哨兵一死一伤，另有两各保加利亚军士兵为侵犯者掳去，希腊保皇军将保加利亚士兵的尸体携往希境，并开枪射击奉命搜寻尸体的保加利亚边防巡逻队。科拉罗夫猛烈抗议“希腊这些继续不已的、危险的挑衅行动”，并要求立即释放被捕去的保军士兵，交回死者尸体，严厉征办应对此事负责者，并对死者家属赔偿损失。
