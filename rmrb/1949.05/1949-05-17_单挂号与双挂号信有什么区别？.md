Answering Li Zhiying's question: What is the difference between single registered mail and double registered mail?
    I. Single Registered Mail: After the sender hands the letter to the post office, the post office registers and issues it with a serial number. Each post office along the way registers it until it is delivered to the recipient. When sending the letter, the sender receives a receipt as proof for future inquiries. In addition, a voucher is attached to the letter and sent with it. After the delivery post office delivers the letter to the recipient, the recipient signs and seals the voucher, which is then archived by the delivery post office as proof of delivery for future inquiries.
    II. Double Registered Mail: In addition to following the procedures for single registered mail, a return receipt is sent with the letter. After the recipient receives the letter, they sign and seal the return receipt and return it to the sender as proof that the letter has been received, equivalent to a confirmation slip. If the sender does not receive the return receipt for a long time, they can take the original mailing receipt to the original post office for a free inquiry. However, sometimes the return receipt is not returned, or the recipient does not sign and seal it because: (1) The sender does not write or does not clearly write the sender's name and address on the return receipt, making it impossible to return. (2) For letters to government agencies or military units, the post office does not personally deliver them to the recipient but only to the mail room, so the return receipt is often not returned or cannot be personally signed and sealed by the recipient. (3) Many people do not have chops (seals), so some only leave a fingerprint, and some do not even leave a fingerprint. (4) Some postal workers think that since the letter has been delivered, it does not matter if the return receipt is returned later, which often results in it being lost or lost during forwarding.
    Regarding the above reasons (1), (2), and (3), besides requesting senders, recipients, and various receiving and distributing organizations to pay attention, the post office itself is working hard to correct these problems.

### 单挂号与双挂号信有什么区别？

　　单挂号与双挂号信有什么区别？答李志英问
    一、单挂号：寄信人把信交到邮局后，邮局即逐件编号登记发出，而且沿途所经邮局所都要登记，一直到投递给收件人为止。寄信时除给寄信人一个收据做为以后查询的执据外，另外在信上还贴着一个凭单，随信发出，待投递局把信交到收件人以后，收件人在凭单上签名盖章，即由投递局存档，作为已经送到之根据，以备日后查询。
    二、双挂号：除按单挂号手续办理外，并有一个回执，随信发出，待收件人收到后，在回执上签名盖章，将回执退回寄信人，证明信已经收到了，等于一个回条。寄信人如很久收不到回执时，可以拿上原来寄信的执据到原来寄信的邮局免费查询。但现在有时回执退不回去或者收件人没有签名盖章，是因为：（一）寄信人寄信时回执上不写或写不清寄件人的姓名住址，无法退。（二）因机关部队的信件，邮局并不亲自投交收件人而是只交到收发室，往往回执退不回来或不能经收件人亲自签名盖章。（三）好多人因没手戳，所以有的只打个手印，有的连手印也不打。（四）有些邮局人员觉得信已送到，回执晚退一时也不要紧，结果往往弄丢了，或者在中途转寄时散失。
    以上第一、二、三项原因除请寄信及收信人与各收发机关注意外，邮局本身的问题正在努力纠正。
