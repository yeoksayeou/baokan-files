    Increased Production and Raw Material Savings
    Liulihe Cement Plant Achieves Success
    [Ping City News] Since the full resumption of production on April 15th, all workers at the Liulihe Cement Plant have launched a revolutionary production competition to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day, with great results in the second half of the month. Cement production has exceeded the original average plan by an average of 52%; clinker production has exceeded the original average plan by an average of 82%; and power generation has exceeded the original average plan by an average of 140%. Each ton of fuel, in addition to burning 2.61 tons of clinker, also generates an average of 286 KWH of electricity, breaking the previous record of 225 KWH. Electricity consumption for each ton of clinker has been reduced from 27.5 KWH to 20.3 KWH. Electricity consumption for grinding raw meal has been reduced from 24 KWH to 21.4 KWH per ton. Coal grinding electricity consumption has been reduced from 40 KWH to 34.75 KWH. Stone crushing electricity consumption has been reduced from 42 KWH to 36.5 KWH per ton. The total average electricity consumption per ton of cement produced has been reduced from a previous low of 154 KWH to 134.4 KWH. The consumption of machine oil per ton has been reduced by 20% (including the substitution of 200 kg of linseed oil), and the consumption of butter per ton has been reduced by 59%. The consumption of bogie oil per ton has been reduced by 36%. The workers say: "The savings are our own. We don't need anyone watching us." On "May Day," the workers opened No. 4 rotary kiln to commemorate the day, naming it the "May 1st" rotary kiln. No. 1 rotary kiln is expected to be repaired by July 1st, and the workers will call it the "July 1st" kiln. Although No. 2 rotary kiln is slightly worse, it has not had any problems in the past half month, and the workers call it the "Labor" kiln. No. 3 rotary kiln is producing better and is called the "Hero" kiln. After receiving these glorious titles, the workers of the kiln and repair teams are working even more actively.

    增产量省原料
    琉璃河水泥厂收到成绩
    【平市讯】琉璃河水泥厂自四月十五日全部开工后，全体职工为迎接“五一”劳动节而开展革命生产竞赛，后半个月收效极大。水泥（洋灰）生产平均按原定平均计划已超过百分之五十二；熟料（灰块）生产平均已超过原定平均计划百分之八十二；发电平均超过原定平均计划百分之一百四十。每吨燃料除烧出二·六一吨灰块外，还平均发电二八六ＫＷＨ，打破以往平均发二二五ＫＷＨ的最高纪录。每吨灰块已往用电二七·五ＫＷＨ，现已减少到二○·三ＫＷＨ。磨生料每吨已往用电二四ＫＷＨ，已减少到二一·四ＫＷＨ。磨煤已往用电四○ＫＷＨ，已减少到三四·七五ＫＷＨ。轧石以往每吨用电四二ＫＷＨ，已减少到三六·五ＫＷＨ。总平均每吨洋灰造成，已往用电最低一五四ＫＷＨ，现已减少到一三四·四ＫＷＨ。用机器油每吨用量减少百分之二十（内还用二○○公斤大麻子油代用），黄油每吨用量减少百分之五十九。台车油每吨用量减少百分之三十六。工友们说：节省下是我们自己的。我们不用人看着我们。“五一”那天，职工们开了四号旋窑来纪念，命名为“五一号”旋窑。一号旋窑准备七一修好，职工将称它为“七一号”。二号旋窑虽稍差点，这半个月尚未出毛病，职工叫它为“劳动号”。三号旋窑生产较好，叫“英雄号”。窑房股修理股的职工接收光荣的称号后，更加积极工作。
