American Imperialism Continues to Invade China and Support Japan
　　Our People Express Strong Indignation
  　In a situation where the Chinese people have achieved a definitive victory and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been declared extinct, American imperialism is still continuing to violate the sovereignty and interests of the Chinese people, assisting the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs in their death throes, and further fostering the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. The U.S. government has not only failed to withdraw its invading land, sea, and air forces from China as demanded by the Chinese people but has also continued to send additional aircraft, warships, and Marines to Qingdao in Shandong Province, China. On May 5th, the U.S. Navy transferred five warships from Japan to Qingdao; on the 7th, four U.S. heavy bombers landed on U.S. aircraft carriers in the waters off Qingdao; and on the 14th, a detachment of 1,500 U.S. Marines landed in Qingdao. This act of American imperialism, violating Chinese sovereignty and interfering in Chinese internal affairs, has aroused the close attention of all Chinese people. At the same time, U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, issued a unilateral statement on the 12th in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation, announcing the cancellation of the Japanese interim reparations plan and the cessation of dismantling Japanese munitions factories. Washington openly admitted that the implication of this statement was the termination of Japanese reparations. This arbitrary measure seriously damages the rights and interests of China and other countries that should receive reparations from Japan. The Chinese people will resolutely refuse to recognize such illegal and reactionary actions. In addition, on May 16th, at the instigation and encouragement of MacArthur, the Japanese House of Representatives passed a bill to expand the Japanese police force. MacArthur's conspiracy to secretly train and equip the Japanese army under the guise of expanding the Japanese police has long been a secret known to the world. These actions by the U.S. government, which threaten peace in the Far East and the interests of the Chinese people, cannot but cause the Chinese people to express strong indignation.

　　美帝继续侵华扶日
  　我国人民强烈愤懑
    在中国人民已经取得确定不移的胜利和国民党反动统治宣告灭亡的情形下，美国帝国主义仍在继续侵犯中国人民的主权和利益，援助国民党匪帮残余势力进行垂死挣扎，并进一步扶植日本侵略势力复活。美国政府不但没有依照中国人民的要求，撤退侵华的陆海空军，而且继续增派飞机、兵舰和海军陆战队到中国山东省的青岛。美国海军于本月五日由日本增调军舰五艘到青岛；七日又有美国重轰炸机四架降落在青岛海面的美航空母舰上；十四日复有美海军陆战队一部一千五百名在青岛登陆。美帝国主义这种侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政的行为，已引起全中国人民的密切注意。同时，美出席远东委员会代表麦考埃于十二日发表违反波次坦公告的片面声明，宣布取消日本临时赔偿计划，停止拆卸日本军火工厂，华盛顿方面并公然承认此项声明之含义即为日本赔偿之终止。这一专横措施严重地损害中国和其他应该获得日本赔偿的国家的权益。中国人民对于这种非法的反动的行动，将坚决不予承认。此外，在本月十六日，在麦克阿瑟唆使和怂恿下，日本众议院通过了扩充日本警察武力法案。麦克阿瑟借扩充日本警察之名进行秘密训练与装备日本陆军的勾当，早已成为举世共知的秘密了。美国政府的这些威胁远东和平和中国人民利益的行动，不能不使中国人民表示强烈的愤懑。
