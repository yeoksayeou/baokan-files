　　Crash Sowing to Leave No Land Unplanted
  　Central Hebei Experiences General Rain, Urgent Rush to Plant
    Cadres Go to the Countryside to Strengthen Leadership; Cooperatives and Banks Provide Loans for Seeds
    [Central Hebei, 22nd Dispatch] On May 21st, there was widespread rainfall in Central Hebei. The current understanding is: the entire Tenth District and Qingyuan County have received ploughing rain. Before breakfast on May 21st, there was widespread rainfall throughout Central Hebei, intermittent in nature. By 3 PM, the Eighth and Ninth Districts had received four to five inches of rain. The Eleventh District was still experiencing rainfall at dinnertime. Based on the rainfall situation, all areas are now capable of sowing. After the rain stopped, the Rongcheng County Committee immediately issued an emergency directive, stating that from May 22nd, county and district cadres should go to the countryside with full force to carry out crash sowing. They called for planting more early-maturing crops: extensively organize full and semi-labor forces, and use labor exchange to carry out sowing. Launch a four-pronged movement of cadres, masses, livestock, and farm tools. For military dependents and families of martyrs who have production difficulties, ensure that tenant farmers sow quickly. They also put forward the slogan "Not an Inch of Land Idle," eliminating wasteland. It was pointed out that sowing is a crucial key to completing this year's production tasks. In addition to instructing the masses to sow, the Qingyuan County Committee also drew eight cadres from various agencies, with four county committee members personally leading the way to go to the countryside immediately for a crash program.

    Grasp Five Key Links
    [Central Hebei, 22nd Dispatch] The Ninth Special District of Central Hebei experienced widespread rainfall on May 21st. Most of the land can now be sown. The Ninth District Committee immediately convened an emergency meeting to organize all forces to rush the planting, aiming to complete the crash sowing and eliminate any bare land, as well as replant cotton seedlings by the end of the month. The task of planting peanuts, in particular, must be guaranteed to meet the plan.

    Leadership must grasp five key links: (1) Solve the seed problem. In addition to the original plan to purchase 500,000 jin of local grain for peanut seeds and lend them out, widely mobilize the masses to borrow from relatives and friends; (2) All cadres from the district, county, and agency levels should go to the countryside and participate in crash planting. All meetings not related to production research should be postponed. During the crash planting period, higher primary and elementary schools should suspend classes to help with crash planting. (3) Organize all available manpower and animal power to ensure that "manpower, livestock, and tools" are all fully utilized. (4) Pay attention to the production of families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers to ensure timely planting. (5) Repair cotton fields. For seedlings that are uneven or have many missing plants, mobilize for transplanting or replanting with sesame and other crops. On the morning of May 22nd, the Ninth District Committee convened a meeting of cadres from district-level Party, government, and people's organizations, forming working groups of 73 cadres and over 500 people from six Party school teams, who were dispatched to nine counties, including Ding County, Anguo, Boye, and Lixian, to lead the masses in crash planting.

    [Another Dispatch] According to the reports from the Eighth District Committee of Central Hebei that Wen'an, Renqiu, Tianjin, Renhe, and other counties in the district had experienced thorough rainfall, and that other counties had received five inches of rain, they immediately telegraphed all subordinate counties, actively mobilizing all efforts to lead the masses in a crash planting campaign. All work affecting the planting task should be postponed. During the planting period, cadres at all levels are not allowed to return home to ensure the successful completion of planting. According to the telegram from the Renqiu District Committee, a seven-day crash planting week has been decided. The specific plan is to first focus on the planting of general crops and completely complete the task of planting peanuts and replanting cotton seedlings. For weak wheat seedlings, peanuts and other crops can be planted in the wheat rows. In addition, for farmers who lack seeds and are unable to purchase them, the county supply and marketing cooperative and the bank have agreed to temporarily borrow 150,000 yuan to purchase seeds and lend them to farmers who are unable to purchase seeds. The Tenth District received the most rainfall, approximately half a foot. The Tenth District Committee promptly issued instructions to carry out crash planting after the rain, leaving no land unplanted, and calling on all personnel, livestock, and equipment from all agencies, schools, and military units, except for a small number retained for agency work, to fully assist the masses in crash planting. They also provided 200,000 jin of local grain to the masses to solve the difficulties faced by poor farmers who are unable to purchase seeds.

    [Shijiazhuang, 22nd Dispatch] Bountiful rain fell in Shijiazhuang. At around 12 noon on May 21st, there was a heavy downpour that stopped at around 3 PM. According to reports from the suburbs, the rainfall reached four inches. The wheat harvest will be secure, and cotton and sugar beets will benefit greatly. The farmers are all very happy and are now busy planting autumn crops.
