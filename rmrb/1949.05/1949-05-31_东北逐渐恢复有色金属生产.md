　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. Non-ferrous metal production is gradually recovering in Northeast China. The productivity of some mines has reached the level of the puppet Manchukuo period. For example, the gold and copper mines in Jiapigou, Jilin Province, achieved 95% of the highest output during the puppet Manchukuo period for the entire year of last year. After August of last year, the average daily ore output exceeded the highest record during the puppet Manchukuo period. The Shizuizi Copper Mine started to recover in April last year and officially started production in December. The daily mining volume now exceeds that of the puppet Manchukuo period by 50%, and the beneficiation volume has increased by 7%. The reverberatory furnace of the First Branch of the Shenyang Smelting Plant could smelt copper nine times per furnace repair during the puppet Manchukuo period, but now it can be used fifteen times. Most of the non-ferrous metal mines in Northeast China are low-grade mines, with fewer high-grade mines. A total of more than 20 mines had been developed during the puppet Manchukuo period, including gold, copper, zinc, lead, aluminum, antimony, magnesium, etc. Many of these mines were still in the initial construction stage at that time and had not yet officially started production. Later, after two destructions by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, almost all the machinery and equipment were dismantled, most of the pit entrances collapsed, and none of the houses were intact. The more severely damaged suffered 85% to 95% losses, while those with lighter losses still suffered more than 20% losses. The Northeast Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau has decided to continue building ten mines this year based on the current needs for developing production and the conditions of manpower and materials, and to strengthen geological surveys and exploration work.

　　东北逐渐恢复有色金属生产
    【新华社沈阳电】东北有色金属的生产正逐渐恢复中。有些矿山的生产力已达到伪满时的水平。如吉林省夹皮沟的金矿、铜矿，去年全年的生产量已达到伪满时最高产量的百分之九十五，去年八月以后，每日的平均出矿量已超过伪满时最高纪录。石咀子铜矿，去年四月开始恢复，十二月正式生产，现每日采矿量超过伪满时百分之五十，选矿量则增高百分之七。沈阳冶炼厂所属第一分厂的反射炉，伪满时修炉一次可溶铜九次，现在则可用到十五次。东北有色金属矿大部是贫矿，富矿较少。伪满时已开发的矿山共计二十余处，包括金、铜、锌、铅、铝、锑、镁等，其中许多矿山当时尚系初建，并未正式生产。以后经过日寇及国民党的两度破坏，机器设备几乎全被拆毁，坑口大部塌陷，房舍亦无一完整。被破坏较重者遭到百分之八十五到九十五的损失，损失轻者亦在百分之二十以上。东北有色金属局已根据目前发展生产的需要和人力物力的条件，决定今年内继续修建矿山十处，并加强地质调查和探采工作。
