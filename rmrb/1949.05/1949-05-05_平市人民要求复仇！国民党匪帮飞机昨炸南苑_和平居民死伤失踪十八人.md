    Ping City People Demand Revenge!
    Kuomintang Bandit Gang Planes Bomb Nanyuan Yesterday
    Peaceful Residents Killed, Injured, and Missing Number Eighteen
    [This newspaper reports] The dying Kuomintang reactionaries are still trying to make a last-ditch struggle. Yesterday at 8:55 AM, six American-made B-24 bombers of the Kuomintang bandit gang sneaked into the airspace over Nanyuan in Beiping, bombing and strafing peaceful people, dropping a total of thirty 1,000- and 500-pound bombs, destroying and collapsing 200 houses, killing four workers and farmers, injuring six, and leaving eight missing (possibly buried under the houses). The Beiping Municipal Government rushed to rescue them before the air raid alarm was lifted. The people of the whole city are extremely angry and have demanded that the People's Liberation Army, which is galloping on the Jiangnan and Northwest fronts, quickly and thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries to avenge the dead.
