Beiping City's Traffic and Pedestrians
Liang Sicheng, Head of the Architecture Department, Tsinghua University

In Britain, around 1937 and 1938, traffic accidents resulted in approximately 66,000 deaths and over 226,000 injuries annually. From January 1940 to the end of June 1941, a period of eighteen months, German bombing of Britain caused 41,900 deaths and over 52,000 injuries. Meanwhile, in the peaceful United States, during the same period, over 51,000 people died under the wheels of automobiles, and 1.5 million were injured. Such casualty rates are comparable to those of war, a truly staggering figure! Currently, Beiping, with a population of over two million, has only over three thousand automobiles, yet traffic accidents are already numerous. If the number of vehicles increases in the future, the number of traffic accidents will be unimaginable. I believe all the drivers in the city hope for improvements regarding traffic and pedestrian issues. I am a veteran driver with twenty-seven years of experience, having obtained driver's licenses in Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and this city. As an architect specializing in urban planning, I would like to offer some suggestions regarding the traffic accident problem in this city, which the People's Daily has repeatedly mentioned, for relevant departments to consider.

To prevent traffic accidents, we must address the root cause. Addressing the root cause involves both active and passive measures. The active aspect involves management and control, which aligns with the second point in the reporter's eleven suggestions: "...formulate practical traffic regulations, strengthen publicity, and thoroughly implement them." The passive aspect involves improving the city's streets, especially intersections, and increasing safety facilities to prevent vehicles from colliding with each other or harming pedestrians during crossings.

Now, I will elaborate on the active and passive aspects separately.

In the active aspect, "formulating practical traffic regulations" is the foundation for addressing the root cause. We hope that the People's Government's highway and public security agencies will soon formulate appropriate regulations based on the actual situation. The regulations should not only specify driving speeds but also emphasize "stop," "wait," and "yield."

The "stop" issue has two aspects: One is emergency stopping in unexpected situations. Drivers must be familiar with the proportional relationship between the vehicle's weight, speed, and the shortest stopping distance required. The regulations should include a table listing these proportions for drivers to memorize. This issue naturally involves regulations concerning the inspection of components, avoiding overloading, and using tire chains in rain and snow. The other aspect is the regulation of parking locations on streets or highways. Whether it is regular parking or parking due to mechanical failure, the principle should be to avoid obstructing traffic and preventing danger. Strict regulations should also prohibit parking near street corners, fire hydrants, post office boxes, and even in front of banks (to prevent car-based robberies). When vehicles must "wait" due to occasional obstructions on the street, regulations must be in place to ensure order and prevent chaos. For example, when railway barriers are down, "waiting" for a train to pass, most vehicles must line up in sequence on the right half of the road. Subsequent vehicles should not be allowed to proceed forward upon seeing the left half of the road is empty. When a tram stops, all other vehicles must stop completely and wait for the tram passengers to finish boarding and alighting before proceeding. All of these should be regulated.

As for the issue of "yielding," it is mutual yielding—vehicles yielding to people, people yielding to vehicles, different types of vehicles yielding to each other. When the elderly, weak, women, and children cross the street, regulations must require all vehicles to yield and wait. If traffic police are present, vehicles must stop to ensure their safety when crossing. When two vehicles arrive at an intersection simultaneously, in the absence of police direction, the vehicle on the left should yield to the vehicle on the right, as stipulated in the regulations. We must vigorously emphasize "yielding," not "dodging." Dodging is a temporary and panicked response and is the consequence of not yielding. Failure to dodge results in accidents. Additionally, the use of lights during nighttime driving also falls under the scope of "yielding" and should be regulated.

The above are just a few of the issues that urgently need to be resolved. Of course, the complete set of regulations must be carefully considered before being finalized.

Publicity work should be launched immediately. The target of publicity should be all citizens. All possible methods and organizations should be used, including newspapers, magazines, radio, slogans, leaflets, schools, cinemas, theaters, and restaurants. Specific measures include:

First, efforts should be made to raise the awareness of pedestrians and drivers of low-speed vehicles and familiarize them with the speed and dynamics of modern high-speed vehicles. Many accidents occur because the victims are unfamiliar with and unaware of these conditions. The Public Security Bureau should periodically publish statistics on traffic accident deaths and injuries, and governments and community organizations at all levels should conduct reviews. Concise slogans and catchphrases outlining precautions for walking should be developed. In elementary and secondary schools, teachers should lecture and guide students. For example, in many Canadian cities, elementary school students must swear an oath at the beginning of each semester: "Before crossing the road, I will first look to the right, then to the left, and then proceed." This is a good method.

Second, drivers should be encouraged to develop a "yielding" mentality—cars yielding to each other, yielding to slower vehicles, and yielding to pedestrians.

Third, automobile drivers must undergo examinations. Before the driving skill test, a very strict traffic regulation test should be conducted first. Those who fail should not be allowed to take the technical test. The first step for this city in the future is to establish practical regulations, printed in booklet form. Applicants must first familiarize themselves with the regulations. Drivers who already have a driver's license must also be required to take the regulation test within a set timeframe, and those who fail will have their driver's license revoked. Military vehicle drivers should receive the same training and testing from their respective units, and military vehicle drivers must be held responsible for developing the habit of obeying police instructions.

As for thorough implementation, the majority of the responsibility lies with the police. Some of Beiping's traffic police do not understand the meaning of directing traffic, and their methods of direction also need significant improvement.

First, the city's traffic police only direct cars and do not direct other vehicles and pedestrians. Often, when they gesture for a car to proceed, a tricycle or bicycle may suddenly dart out from under their outstretched arm, and the police do not stop it, creating an ambush-like situation for the car. Therefore, car drivers dare not completely trust police directions and must make their own judgments about proceeding or stopping. This is the experience of every driver in the city. Therefore, when the police make a "stop" gesture, all pedestrians and vehicles should stop.

Second, to make it easier for all pedestrians and vehicles to accept directions, each traffic police officer should use gestures and sound together; therefore, they must have a whistle. Each time the direction of traffic flow changes, the officer should blow a long whistle to alert pedestrians and vehicles and then direct this direction to stop and another direction to proceed. After this direction stops, a slight pause should be allowed to allow the vehicles and pedestrians in this direction to finish crossing before releasing the other direction. If there are vehicles violating the regulations, a rapid, frequent whistle sound can be used to stop them.

Third, a few of Beiping's traffic police are not directing cars but being directed by cars. When they see a car coming, they make a mechanical movement, like performing a certain movement from infantry drill regulations. When making this movement, they often do not first look at the road conditions. When the car is less than ten feet away from them, they suddenly "drill" like this, making it impossible for the driver to know their intention in advance; thus, in front of the police, the driver must still decide for themselves whether to slow down or stop. I believe that when directing vehicles, the police must first focus on the driver from a distance of fifteen to twenty meters to establish visual contact and then give directions. If the Public Security Bureau can collect films of police directing vehicles from across the country and provide our police with practical training, it can greatly benefit the safety of citizens.

Fourth, the gestures of Beiping's police are not only too mechanical but also extremely unclear. I think the most obvious basic action is to raise the palm in front of the chest towards the "stop" direction, or to raise the arm high with the palm facing forward in a blocking posture. In the "proceed" direction, the arm must continue to beckon.

The "passive" aspect belongs to the realm of urban planning. The work in this area involves improving the main streets and intersections and installing various equipment to increase the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. This work requires first conducting surveys and statistics on the number and dynamics of vehicles, as well as predicting future trends, and then planning road networks or road systems, renovating road intersections, adding new city gate openings, and so on. It is a very complicated task that cannot be fully explained in a few words, so it will not be discussed in detail here.

The work that can be done at present is to first divide car lanes and slow vehicle lanes on the streets. Add red and green traffic lights at intersections and improve existing traffic lights. The existing traffic lights have insufficient light and are only visible from one side, which fails to maximize their effectiveness and should be improved.

There are many books on traffic, pedestrians, and street planning. One that is widely recognized by many urban planners as the most concise and appropriate is "Town Planning and Road Traffic" by Sir Herbert A. Tripp, Deputy Commissioner of the London Police, which can be consulted.

    北平市的行车与行人
    清华大学建筑系系主任  梁思成
    英国在一九三七及一九三八年前后，每年车祸死亡约六万六千人，受伤者约二十二万六千余人。从一九四○年一月至一九四一年六月底，十八个月间，德机轰炸英国，死四万一千九百人，伤五万二千余人，而在太平无事的美国，在同期间，死于汽车轮下者五万一千余人，伤者一百五十万人。这种的伤亡率，可与大战比并，是多么惊人的数字！现在北平二百余万人口，仅有汽车三千余辆，车祸已经很多；将来若车数增加，车祸数字将更不堪设想。我相信全市的汽车司机们对于行车行人的问题都希望有所改善。我是一个有二十七年经验的老司机，曾经在欧美、南洋和本市考领过司机执照，而又是研究都市计划的建筑师。现在以这双层资格，对人民日报一再提到的本市车祸问题提出一些建议，供有关方面参考。
    若求防止车祸，应该治本。治本的方法，有动的和静的两方面。动的方面，就是管理和指挥的问题，也就是记者先生所提十一条中第二条的“……订定切合实际的交通规章，加强宣传，彻底执行。”静的方面就是将本市的街道，尤其是交叉路口加以改善，增加安全设备，务使车辆交错时不致互相挤撞，或伤害行人。
    现在动的和静的两方面问题分别略予申论。
    在动的方面，“订定切合实际的交通规章”是治本的基础。我们企盼人民政府公路和公安各机关早日按实际情形订定妥善的规章。规章内容不惟应制定行车速度等，同时应强调“停”、“等”、“让”。
    “停”的问点有两个方面：一方面是意外的紧急停车：司机人须熟悉车身重量、速度与所需停止的最短距离的比例。规章中应作表列，使司机人牢记。这问题当然还牵涉到机件或滥带检查乃至雨雪天载用轮炼等等规定。另一方面是在街道上或公路上停车位置的规定，无论是通常停车或因机件障碍停车，都以不碍交通，避免危险为原则。至如街角，救火水龙头附近，邮政信箱前面，乃至银行门前（预防用汽车的抢匪），禁止停放车辆，也应严格规定。街上偶有障碍，车辆须“等”的时候，必须规定遵守秩序，以免陷于混乱。例如铁路栅栏放下，“等”过火车时，多数车辆都须在路之右半衔接排列等待。不许后来的车辆看见左半空虚而开上前去。电车停止时，一切其他车辆必须全部停止，等待电车乘客上下完毕，电车开行后，始准开行。这都应有所规定。
    至于“让”的问题，是互让，车让人，人让车，各种车互让，老弱妇孺横过街面，须规定一切车辆要让，要等。如有交通警察在场，更须停止车辆，保护他们安全渡过两辆车同时达到十字街头，若无警察指挥，应在规定左。的车让右方的车先走。我们须极力强调“让”，不说“躲”。躲是临时慌张的应变措施，是不让而发生的后果。躲不及便要出险。此外如夜间行驶时灯光之使用，也属于“让”的范围，也须规定。
    以上所举只是几个目前急待解决的问题。全部规章当然尚须经过缜密考虑后厘定。
    宣传工作应该立即展开。宣传应以全体市民为对象；应该利用报纸、杂志、广播、标语、传单、学校、影院、剧场、饭馆等一切可能的方法和机构。具体的做法：
    第一、应该用一切方法提高行路人及低速度车辆驾驶人的警惕性，并使能对现代化高速度车辆的速度与动态熟悉。因为有许多车祸是由于被撞者不熟悉与不警惕上述情形而发生的。公安局应按期公布车祸死伤的统计数字，由各级人民政府及社团集会检讨，将行路时应该注意的事项编制成简明的口号标语；各中小学里由教师们对学生讲授指导。例如加拿大许多城市的小学生，每学期开学时都须宣誓：“我越过马路之先必先向右看，然后向左看，然后开步走。”就是一个好法子。
    第二、应该养成司机“让”的心理。汽车互让，让慢行车辆，让行路人。
    第三、汽车司机要实行考试。在驾驶技术考试之先，要先举行极严格的交通规章考试。不及格的人，根本不能受技术考试。本市今后第一步须订立切合实际的规章，印成方手。报考人须先熟读规章。已领有驾驶执照的司机，也须全部限期应规章考试，不及格者撤销其驾驶执照。军用车司机，应由各部队干部作同样的训练和考试，并须责成军车司机养成服从警察指挥的习惯。
    至于彻底执行，大部分的责任在警察。北平的交通警察，尚有少数不明了指挥交通的意义；指挥方法也大有改善之必要。
    第一、本市的交通警察只指挥汽车，而不指挥其他车辆与行人。往往在他作手势令汽车前进时，从他横伸的臂膀下面可能忽然冲出一辆三轮或自行车，警察并不加以制止，埋伏式的给汽车以突击。因此汽车司机对于警察指挥完全不敢信任，还须临时自己酌定进止。这是本市每一个司机所经验过的。所以在警察作“停止”的手势时，一切的行人车辆均应停止。
    第二、为使所有行人车辆易于接受指挥起见，每个交通警察都应以手势和声音并用，因此他须有一个警笛。每次改变通行方向时，吹笛一长声，使行人车辆听见，然后指挥这一方向停止，另一方向行进。这一方向停止之后，须略等少许时间，使这一方向车辆行人走完，然后将另一方向放行。若有犯规的车辆，也可用急促频吹的笛声加以制止。
    第三、北平有少数的交通警察，不是指挥汽车，而是受汽车指挥。他们看见汽车来，便作一种机械式的动作，如同表演步兵操典里的某一种动作。作这种动作时，往往不先看看路的情形，等汽车到了离他不及一丈远时，他突然如此“操演”一下，使司机未能先知道他的意思；以致在警察面前，司机仍须自己决定缓速进止。我认为指挥车辆时，警察须在距离十五至二十公尺之外，先就注视司机，取得视觉的联系，然后予以指挥。公安局若能搜集全国警察指挥车辆的电影，给我们的警察一种切合实际的训练。当可裨益于市民之安全不少。
    第四、北平警察指挥的手势，不惟过于机械，且极不明显。我觉得最明显的基本动作，就是向“停止”方面举掌在胸前，或将臂高举，掌心向前，作拦阻之势。在“通行”的方面，则手臂须继续的招送。
    “静”的方面，是属于都市计划的问题。这方面的工作，是将主要的街道和交叉路口，加以改善。装置足以增加行车行人安全的各种设备。这种工作须先作车辆数量和动态的调查统计，以及对于将来的预测，然后计划道路网或道路系统，改造道路交叉口，增辟城门洞等等，是一步极繁难的工作，不是几句话所能说完的，所以不在此详细讨论。
    目前可做的工作，尽可先在街上分划汽车道及慢行车道。交叉路口添装红绿指挥灯，并将现有红绿灯改善。现有红绿灯光线不足，而且只是一面看，未能收最大的效果，是应该加以改善的。
    关于行车行人与街道计划的书籍颇多，被许多都市计划家所公认为最扼要得当的一本是伦敦警察副总监Ｓｉｒ  Ｈｅｒｂｅｒｔ  Ａ．Ｔｒｉｐｐ所著的“都市计划与道路交通”（Ｔｏｗｎ  Ｐｌａｎｎｉｎｇ  ａｎｄ  Ｒｏａｄ  Ｔｒａｆｆｉｃ）可参考。
