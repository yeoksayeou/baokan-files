    Visiting Mr. He Kongcai
    By our reporter Baisheng

    In this century of the people, in the tide of the great revolution, many intellectuals with conscience and a desire to progress have joined the revolutionary ranks, abandoning their pasts and beginning new journeys in the hearts of the people. There are many, many such people, and Mr. He Kongcai is one of them. Now, he has followed the people's army southward, participating in the research office of the southbound workgroup. Why was he able to do this? What was he thinking? What kind of self-struggle did he go through? To answer these questions, the reporter interviewed him on the sixth of this month, on the eve of his departure from Beiping.

    I met him in a quaint courtyard along the Xihai River in Xicheng. He was a middle-aged man in his forties, wearing a gray cloth gown, simple and refined. He was reading with his glasses on, reading Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks."

    Mr. He is a native of Gucheng County, Hebei Province, and is forty-seven years old this year. Before liberation, he served as the Secretary-General of China University and the manager of the Hebei Provincial Gazetteer and the National History Museum. His home has a library called "Tanxi Study," where his grandfather began collecting books during the Jiaqing era of the Qing Dynasty. To date, it has a collection of 100,000 ancient books, more than 5,200 kinds of ancient artifacts, and 56 boxes of printing plates. He is a man who has emerged from studying these cultural relics and ancient books. In the past feudal society, he spent his days reciting ancient poems, reading scriptures, carving seals, playing with antiques, associating with scholars and literati, composing poems, and discussing the past and present. He was a typical old Chinese intellectual. He was once dissatisfied with that old society and old life, but he was powerless to change it, so he drifted along with the world, without being of any help.

    But he finally changed. As he himself said, "I am willing to put down my inherent baggage and start anew as a primary school student of the masses." He donated all his books and cultural relics to the People's Beiping Library and the History Museum. He told the reporter, "My motivation for donating all the books and cultural relics is by no means out of a momentary impulse. In the past, during the Kuomintang's rule, the government and the people were opposed to each other. The government was always exploiting the people, and the people were always opposing the government. If I had donated them at that time, they would have been sent abroad by the Kuomintang's corrupt officials. I couldn't even think about it then; it was the most painful world. Fortunately, Beiping was liberated. We saw the truly People's government and army. I read many policy and political books of the Communist Party. I began to recognize the times, and my depressed heart suddenly opened up. I saw the road to New Democracy." "But," he said, "from the past, I was backward, so I must hurry to catch up. In the past, my ideological life was idealistic, and my work attitude was passive. Although I was incorruptible, I accomplished nothing. Today, I want to boldly negate myself, throw off the ancient feudal baggage, and understand the fresh blood of the people. This is a deep hatred for the old society and also an enthusiasm for the new society." He excitedly said that the country has many good things, and the people have endless real objects. Donating these things to the country is truly "insignificant, not even a millet grain," merely expressing a little of his heart.

    Then, Mr. He said that his own transformation was certainly not sudden but had changed step by step. During the period when Beiping was lost, demons roamed rampant, and he was still very depressed. Later, the Kuomintang ran into Beiping, and all kinds of facts quickly and ruthlessly shattered his rights. He had to face the bloody reality and find a way out of his distress. He began to contact some progressive intellectuals and found some new books. He hid the new books in piles of old books and read them one by one. At first, he read them secretly himself, and later he shared them with his children. Father and son influenced each other, and the old and the young developed each other. At first, he guided the children, and later the children took the lead, and he followed closely, which made him progress. He talked about his four children participating in revolutionary work and excitedly said, "Today, I will no longer teach them to read the Four Books and Five Classics. Today, my children and I have jointly participated in the people's revolutionary work. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we will all definitely learn well. I can happily say to you: We have truly found the road we should take." (Attached picture)

    访问贺孔才先生
    本报记者  柏生
    在这人民的世纪中，大革命的潮流中，多少有良心、想前进的知识分子参加到革命队伍中来，抛弃了自己的过去，在人民心中，开始新的旅程。这样的人很多很多，贺孔才先生就是其中的一个。现在，他已经随着人民的军队南下了，他参加了南下工作团的研究室工作。他为什么能够这样作呢？他到底是怎么想的？他经历了一些什么样的自我斗争的过程？为了回答这些问题，记者在本月六日他离平前夕，特地访问了他。
    在西城西海河沿一个古色古香的院落里，我会见了他，他是一位四十余岁，身着灰布长衫，朴实而文雅的中年。他那时正在挑起眼镜读书，读着毛主席的“目前形势，我们的任务”。
    贺先生原籍河北故城县，今年四十七岁了，解放前曾任中国大学秘书长，河北省通志馆及国史馆经理。他家里设有藏书室，名叫“潭西书屋”，前清喜嘉年间，他的大就开始藏书，至今已有二百来年，藏有古书十万卷，各种古物文玩五千二百余种，书版五十六箱。他是从这些文物古书推里钻研出来的人。在过去的封建社会中，整天吟古诗，念经书，刻团章，玩古物，结交一辈学士文人，唱和诗词，论今说古，那是一个典型的中国旧知识分子。他曾经不满意那种旧社会、旧生活，但是又无力改造它，以致与世浮沉，助。
    但是，他终于转变了。正是他自己说的，“我愿意放下固有的包袱，重新做一个群众的小学生。”他把他所有的书籍文物悉数清书籍人民的北平图书馆和历史博物馆。他对记者说：“我捐赠全部书籍文物的动机，绝不是出于一时感情的冲动。在过去国民党统治时期，政府和人民是对立的，政府在时不在压榨人民，人民无时不在反对政府，要在这时候捐出来，早被国民党的贪官污利们送到外国去了。那时候想不出都没有主，这是最苦人的世道。幸好，北平解放了，我们见了真正人民的政府和军队，我看了共产党许多政策政治论书籍。我开始认清了时代，闷了的心胸豁然开朗，我着见新民主主义的道路了。”“但是”，他说：“从过去讲，我是落后的，所以要急忙赶上去。过去我的思想生活是唯心的，工作态度是消极的。虽是两袖清风，到底一事无成。今天我要大胆的否定自己，抛下古老的封建的包袱，了解人民的新鲜的血液。这是对旧社会的痛很，也是对新社会的发荣。”他兴奋的说，国家的好东西多得很，人民中的实物无穷无竭，这点东西捐给国家，真是“渺小不之一粟”，表示自己一点心意而已。
    接着，贺先生说：他自己的转变当然不是突然的，而是一步步改变过来的。在北平论陷期间，鬼魅横行，他还是很消沉的，以后国民党跑进了北平，各种各样的事实，迅速地把他的权利无情打碎了，他不得不正视血淋淋的现实，在苦闷中找出路，他开始接触了一些进步的知识分子，找到了一些新的书籍。他把新书藏在古书堆中，一本本的看下去。先是自己偷偷地看，后来也分给他的孩子们看。父子互相影响，老板彼此开发，先是他引导着孩子们，后来孩子先走他紧跟，并且使他进步了。他谈到了参加革命工作的四个孩子，兴奋的说：“今天我再不会教他们读四书五经了。今天我和我的孩子们一同参加了人民革命工作，在共产党的领导下，我们一定都会学好的。我可以向你高兴的说：我们真正找到了应走的道路。”（附图片）
