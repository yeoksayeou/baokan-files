To Ensure Members Eat Good Grain, Facilitate Transactions with Neighboring Areas
　　Ping Municipality Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Headquarters Establishes Grain and Goods Depot

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Ping Municipality Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Headquarters, to further promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and supply the food needs of its employees and members, has established the Xuanwumen Grain and Goods Depot at 29 Xichenggen, Xuanwai, and is scheduled to officially open for business on the 15th of this month. The depot has one hundred rooms and two warehouses, capable of holding more than 4,000 tons of goods. It also has eight electric mills, two electric rice hullers, and six oil presses. The electric mills began operation on the 2nd, and can produce 8,000 to 10,000 catties of corn flour per day, with better quality than that produced by the processing and consignment shops entrusted by the Municipal Trading Company. After the official opening, the depot can regularly produce 15,000 catties. This not only guarantees the quantity and quality of grain for employees and members, but also allows processing and consignment shops to use the flour processed by the depot as a standard, preventing them from arbitrarily cutting corners.
　　
　　In addition to processing and milling flour to meet the needs of employees and members of cooperative societies in factories and government agencies in the city, the depot also engages in trust, storage, transportation, and agency purchase and sale businesses, to facilitate transactions for cooperative societies in neighboring friendly areas in Ping Municipality. Public enterprises storing grain at the depot and private merchants entrusting the depot with purchasing, transporting, and selling are all welcome. The depot aims to serve the people, unlike private goods depots, which purely seek profit. For example, for goods being turned over, private goods depots charge a remuneration of twelve catties of corn per ton per month, while the depot only charges nine and a half catties. For goods stored at the end of the month and picked up at the beginning of the next month, not exceeding thirty days, the price is calculated only for one month, unlike private depots, which charge remuneration for two months based on the month.

　　保证社员吃好粮　便利邻区来交易
  　平市合作供销总社设粮货栈
    【本报讯】平市合作供销总社为更进一步促进城乡物资交流，供给各职工社员之食粮需要，特在宣外西城根二十九号设立宣武门粮货栈，并定于本月十五日正式开张营业。该栈拥有房屋百间，仓库两所，可容货物四千余吨。并有电磨八台，电碾两台，榨油机六架。电磨已于二日开工，每天可出玉米面八千斤至一万斤，质量比市贸易公司所委托的加工代销店所产为佳。正式开张后，该栈经常可出一万五千斤。不仅保证职工社员的粮食数量和质量，且可使各加工代销店以该栈所加工之面粉为准，不致擅自偷工减料。
    该栈除加工代磨面粉，供给本市各工厂机关合作社职工社员需要外，并经营信托，保管，运输，代客买卖等业务，以便利各友邻区合作社在平市交易。对公营企业在该栈存粮，私人商户委托该栈采购运销，均所欢迎。该栈以服务人民为目的。不象私人货栈之单纯牟利。如货物倒囤，每月每吨私人货栈为十二斤玉米酬金，该栈仅用九斤半。在月尾存货月初取货不超过三十天者，亦仅按一个月计价，不象私人按月份计价，收二个月酬金。
