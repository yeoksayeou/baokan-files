    In his inaugural address on January 20th, Truman put forward a program of "four major courses of action" for the United States to consider. One of these courses of action he stipulated as follows: "In cooperation with other nations, we should foster capital investment in areas needing development."
    What do the so-called "backward areas" elucidated in the American newspapers' commentary on Truman's speech mean? These areas include Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, India and Pakistan. In other words, they are the Asian and African colonies and dependencies of the Marshall Plan countries, Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
    American monopoly capital has already placed the European colonial powers under its own control, and now it openly declares its determination to similarly control their colonies. The new Truman Plan, as the docile American newspapers immediately pointed out, is a continuation of the old Marshall Plan. Like the Marshall Plan, it is an attempt to establish the world hegemony of American monopoly capital.
    When Truman announced this broad program of colonial expansion, he said: "The old imperialism – exploitation for foreign profit – has no place in our plans."
    However, according to disclosures in the American newspapers, under the recent Truman Plan, investment in "backward areas" will be carried out by private companies, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Marshall Plan Administration. Obviously, American tycoons are trying to invest in the colonies in order to obtain profits from the exploitation of the colonial people.
    In fact, this is a basic law of capitalist economics, a law that cannot be changed by rhetoric and deception.
    All American monopoly capital now active in the "backward areas" of Asia and Africa obtains huge super-profits from the exploitation of cheap, almost unpaid colonial labor. In this respect, the essence of American monopoly capital does not differ in any way from the essence of Truman's so-called "old imperialism."
    But there is one thing that should distinguish the new essence from the old essence, and that is the scope and scale of the American expansion program. American monopoly capital hopes to possess all the colonies and "backward areas" in the world. American monopoly capital shows that they are prepared to "cooperate" with other colonial powers. This means allowing those original "masters" to maintain their criminal rule over the colonies; it means using their armies to suppress the growing and spreading liberation movements of the colonial peoples; attempting to make these countries act as American police and watchdogs; and even having them participate, on the basis of subordinate partners, in the joint exploitation of the colonies. But the majority of the profits extracted from the colonies flow into the pockets of American monopoly capitalists.
    When the world's colonies had already been divided up, and American capital had only obtained a relatively small portion of the plunder, it often advocated a policy of "open door" in the colonies of other countries. But other colonial countries refused to recognize this principle of "open door." They kept their territories tightly locked and tried their best to defend against the intrusion of economically stronger American competitors. But now the United States is ordering its Marshall Plan servants to open the doors of their colonies to American companies. And these servants are also prepared to do their best to bring glory to their masters and obey their orders.
    Following Truman's inaugural address was a statement from a British Foreign Office spokesman, who said: The British government "will also similarly focus special attention on the development of backward areas," and said: "Many of the words in Truman's speech are connected with the statement of British policy."
    Five days later, Bevin made a speech at a luncheon of the Foreign Press Association in London, saying: "We welcome Truman's statement. We will invest our knowledge, ability, and all financial resources in this joint venture."
    It is possible that the British rulers hope for the help of American capital to save their collapsing colonial empire. But the fact is this: their rapid acceptance of Truman's new plan is also signing their own death certificate.
    The London Conservative newspaper "The Observer" wrote this about the situation in the Middle East on January 9: "The power on which the security of this important region depends has become not Britain, but the United States... It (referring to Britain's influence in the Middle East) can be improved, only because we work with the United States, not because of working against the United States. In fact, we remain in the Middle East in a state that is not obvious for some time, but it can restore Britain's position in time—a secondary position, but still an influential one." In other words, this is a proposal: Britain should cede its hegemony in the Middle East to the United States, while it itself retreats to a subordinate role, because without American help, it cannot suppress the growing liberation movement of the Middle Eastern people. This is the aim that Attlee and Bevin are pursuing. On these principles, Britain and the United States reached an understanding on the Middle East issue in January.
    But American capital is not only satisfied with the Middle East. It demands that this unique form of "cooperation" be extended to the entire British Empire, to all colonial empires, and equally to all backward dependencies and semi-dependencies of the European powers.
      ◇      ◇      ◇
    The intrusion of American monopoly capital into the colonies of European countries is not a new method.
    Since 1922, American capital has been active in Indonesia, when Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company obtained its share in plundering the oil reserves of Sumatra. Today, Rockefeller owns hundreds of kerosene bases and several refineries in Indonesia. The total area of American rubber plantations in Indonesia is one million acres; hundreds of thousands of acres belong to "Haw Par" Rubber Company and Federal Rubber Company. American companies and firms also buy up almost all the rubber of Dutch rubber plantation owners. Under the Marshall Plan, the United States provides loans to the Dutch government, which in turn, imposes unlimited demands for access to Indonesia's raw material resources. American companies are developing nickel mines in West Celebes and demanding new oil areas in Sumatra, Borneo and New Guinea, as well as exporting tin and lead from the Billiton and Bangka Islands. For strategic purposes and to discover new oil areas, the U.S. Air Force has carried out mapping surveys of Indonesia. American airlines are building airports in Java, Borneo, Celebes and New Guinea. American investment in Indonesia is constantly increasing. In 1946, it was less than 10 percent of all foreign property, but now it has increased to 40 percent, which is twice as much as Britain and two and a half times as much as the Netherlands.
    American economic expansion has been going hand in hand with their active assistance to Dutch imperialism in its aggression against the Republic of Indonesia. Under the guise of "mediation", seeking its own interests, the United States has come forward to undermine the independence of the Indonesian people. American monopoly capital has gained a foothold in Indonesia and is using it as a base to penetrate other Southeast Asian countries—Malaya, Vietnam, Siam, India, and Pakistan.
    The United States had already gained a foothold in French colonies during World War II. When the Allies landed in North Africa, American companies immediately began prospecting for oil in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. The New York Times Paris correspondent said on January 19th this year: The American "Gulf" oil company will soon accept a concession for an oil field in Tunisia. American companies are acquiring shares in French colonial companies, many of which are only nominally French.
    In 1947, three American companies: Newmont Mining Corporation, Lead Company, and United Mining Company, controlled 50 percent of the lead production in French Morocco. Using Liberia as its base, American capital is gradually penetrating French West Africa and Equatorial Africa. Along with this economic expansion, the United States is strengthening its military position, not only maintaining but even considerably expanding its network of land, sea, and air bases in the territory of the French Union.
    American imperialism is helping France to wage war against the Vietnamese people. In this regard, it is significant that the warmonger Bullitt visited Vietnam at the end of 1947 with the aim of supporting the American-French puppet Vietnamese King Bao Dai to ascend the throne. The actual purpose of this plan (which is enthusiastically advocated by American imperialism and its French servants) is to turn Vietnam into an American colony, occupy the country's resources, especially rubber and railways.

    美帝殖民地扩张的新计划
    Ｖ·卢特斯基原作  杨甫译
    杜鲁门在他的一月二十日就任典礼的演词中，提出美国考虑的“四大行动方针”的纲领。这些方针之一，他作如下的规定：“在和其他国家合作中间，我们应在需要发展的地区实行投资”。
    美国报纸对杜鲁门演词的评论中所阐述的所谓“落后地区”是意味着什么呢？这些地区是包括非洲、中东和远东，印度和巴基斯坦。换句话说，即是马歇尔计划的国家英、法、比、荷的亚洲和非洲的殖民地及附属国。
    美国垄断资本已将欧洲的殖民地强国置于自己的支配之下，现在竟公然宣布决心要同样的控制他们的殖民地。新的杜鲁门计划，正如驯服的美国报纸所立即加以指明的，是旧马歇尔计划的继续。它象马歇尔计划一样，是企图建立美国垄断资本的世界霸权。
    杜鲁门宣布这个扩张殖民地的广泛的纲领时说：“剥削外国利润的旧帝国主义，在我们纲领中是没有地位的。”
    可是，根据美国报纸的透露，在最近的杜鲁门计划之下，对“落后地区”投资，是由私人公司，国际复兴银行和马歇尔计划执行部来执行。显然美国大亨们为了从剥削殖民地人民而取得利润才企图投资于各殖民地的。
    实际上，这是资本主义经济的一个基本规律，这种规律并非一些花言巧语和欺骗所能改变的。
    一切美国垄断资本，现在亚洲和非洲的“落后地区”的活动，从剥削廉价的几乎没有报酬的殖民地的劳动力中，获取巨大的超额利润。依此，美国垄断资本的本质，和杜鲁门的所谓“旧帝国主义”的本质，并没有什么区别。
    但是有一件东西，是应把新的本质从旧的本质，区别开来，那就是美国扩张纲领的范围和规模。美国垄断资本希望占有全世界所有的殖民地和“落后地区”。美国垄断资本表明，他们准备和其他殖民地的强国“合作”这就是允许那些原来的“主人们”保持殖民地的罪恶统治；就是要使用他们的军队去镇压殖民地人民的日益发展和蔓延的解放运动；企图使这些国家起着成为美国的警察和看门狗的作用；甚至要他们在下属伙伴的基础上，参加对殖民地的联合剥削。但是从殖民地榨取来的利润的大部分，都由此而流入美国垄断资本家的钱袋里。
    当世界殖民地已被瓜分完了，美国资本仅仅得到掠夺的比较小的部分的时候，它常常主张在别国的殖民地中实行“门户开放”的政策。但是其他殖民地国家拒绝承认这种“门户开放”的原则。他们在紧锁之下，保有他们的领有地，并尽量努力防御在经济上更强的美国竞争者的侵入。但是现在美国正命令着它的马歇尔计划的奴仆们，给美国公司开放他们的殖民地的门户。而这些奴仆们也准备尽量给主人争光和服从命令。
    跟着杜鲁门就任演词之后，是英国外交部发言人的谈话，他说：英国政府“也将同样地特别集中注意力于落后地区之发展。”并说：“杜鲁门演辞的字里行间，许多是和英国政策的声明联系着的。”
    五天之后，贝文在伦敦的外国新闻协会的午餐中发表谈话，他说：“我们欢迎杜鲁门的声明。我们将以我们的知识、能力，和所有的财源投进于这个共同的经营之中。”
    这是可能的，英国统治者希望美国资本的帮助，来挽救他们的正在溃灭中的殖民帝国。但是事实是这样：他们迅速地接受杜鲁门的新计划，同时也是在签署着自己死亡的证书。
    伦敦保守党的“观察家”报，于一月九日关于中东的情况这样写着：“变成这种重要地区安全所赖的权力，已非英国，而是美国……它（指英国在中东的影响）能够被改进，只仅仅是由于我们和美国一道工作，而不是由于反对美国而工作。事实上，我们在中东仍然在若干时间内保持着不大明显的状态，但它可以及时的恢复英国的地位——次等地位，但仍然是有影响的。”换句话说，这就是提议：英国把它在中东的霸权让给美国，而他自己则退为下属的作用，因为没有美国的帮助，它就不可能压服中东人民日益增长的解放运动。这就是艾德礼和贝文正在遵循着的目的。在这些原则上面，英美对中东问题在一月已达到了谅解。
    但是美国资本并不只满足于中东。它要求把这种独特的“合作”形式，扩展到英帝国的全部，扩展到一切殖民地帝国，同样扩展到欧洲强国的一切落后的附属国和半附属国。
      ◇      ◇      ◇
    美国垄断资本侵入欧洲各国的殖民地，并不是新的方法。
    自从一九二二年以来，美国资本在印尼就已经活动着，当时洛克菲勒美孚油公司，在掠夺苏门答腊的油藏中已获得了自己的份儿。今天，洛克菲勒公司在印尼拥有几百处煤油基地和好几个炼油所。在印尼的美国树胶园总共一百万英亩；几十万英亩则属于“豪富”树胶公司和联邦树胶公司。美国公司商行又收买荷兰几乎全部树胶园主的树胶。美国在马歇尔计划之下，给荷兰政府以借款，转过来就无限制的要求取得印尼的原料资源，美国公司开发西利伯斯的镍矿，要求在苏门答腊、婆罗洲和新几内亚的新油区，以及从比利顿和邦加群岛输出锡和铅。为了战略目的和发现新油区，美国空军对印尼做过绘图测量。美国航空公司在爪哇、婆罗洲、西利伯斯和新几内亚建筑飞机场。美国在印尼的投资不断地增加，一九四六年，总计尚不及一切外国财产的百分之十，但现在已增加至百分之四十，即比英国多两倍，比荷兰多两倍半。
    美国经济的扩张，和他们积极帮助荷兰帝国主义进攻印尼共和国，是同时并进的。在“调解”的伪装之下，寻求它自己的利益，美国出而破坏印尼人民的独立。美国垄断资本已插脚于印尼，并以此作为深入其他东南亚国家——马来亚、越南、暹罗、印度，和巴基斯坦的基地。
    在法国殖民地，当第二次世界大战时，美国就已获得立足点。当盟国在北非登陆时，美国公司就立即在阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥试掘煤油。纽约时报今年一月十九日的巴黎通讯中说：美国“海湾”煤油公司，不久即将接受突尼斯的一个油矿的特许权。美国公司正收购法国殖民地公司的股份，这些公司当中，许多只在名义上是法国的了。
    一九四七年，三个美国公司：纽蒙特矿业公司、李德公司和联合矿务公司，控制了法属摩洛哥铅出产的百分之五十。从利比里亚作为它的基地，美国资本一步步地深入法属西非洲和赤道非洲。和这种经济扩张同时，美国正加强它的军事地位，在法兰西联邦的领土上，它不但保持而且甚至相当扩大了陆海空的基地网。
    美帝国主义正帮助着法国从事反对越南人民的战争。关于这方面，战争贩子布立特，以扶植美法傀儡的越王保大重登皇位为目的，而于一九四七年底访问越南，这是有意义的。这种计划（正是美帝国主义和它的法国奴仆们所热烈主张的）的实际目的，就是使越南变为美国的殖民地，占有这个国家的资源，尤其主要的是树胶和铁路。  （未完）
