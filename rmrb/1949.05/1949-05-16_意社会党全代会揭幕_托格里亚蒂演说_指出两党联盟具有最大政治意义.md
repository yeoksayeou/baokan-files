Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15th Dispatch from TASS, Florence: The 28th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party has opened in Florence. Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, sent his congratulations to the congress. He emphasized that the fact that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are able to maintain and fulfill the united action alliance despite all difficulties and enemy slanders has the greatest political significance. This alliance has united the two parties since the underground struggle against fascism. This situation has become a constant factor that our enemies have had to consider in recent years. The period from the Genoa Congress of the Socialist Party to this congress has been one of the most severe tests of the united action alliance, but both parties have passed this test with honor. They knocked out the slander weapons in the hands of the enemy. Our enemies used this weapon against our policy of united action, trying to spread discord and division among the ranks of the working people. The starting points of our two parties' policies are different, and we honestly admit this, but we act faithfully and sincerely, and we keep in mind – just as you remember – abandoning the policy of united action would mean abandoning the guiding principles of the working-class struggle.

When Shen Komeiti, Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, delivered his report at the evening meeting, he pointed out that the Socialist Party currently has 537,000 members, while it had only 519,000 members at the previous congress. These figures expose the enemy's nonsense about the Socialist Party's ranks continuing to "melt away."

When Shen Komeiti talked about the general issues of the party's policy, he pointed out that the middle-of-the-road faction and the Socialist Party leadership composed of middle-of-the-roaders have advocated in the past and continue to advocate that the working people should unite in the ranks of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, condemning the activities of right-wing Socialist Party members in trade union organizations; approving the united action alliance with the Communist Party, and maintaining the Socialist Party's autonomy.

　　意社会党全代会揭幕
    托格里亚蒂演说
  　指出两党联盟具有最大政治意义
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社佛罗伦萨讯：意大利社会党第二十八届全国代表大会已在佛罗伦萨揭幕。意共总书记托格里亚蒂向大会致贺，他着重指出：共产党与社会党不顾一切困难和敌人的诽谤宣传而能够保持与履行统一行动联盟一事具有最大的政治意义，这种联盟自进行反法西斯的地下斗争以来，就把两党联合在一起。这种情势在最近几年来已成为我们的敌人不得不加以考虑的经常因素。从社会党热那亚大会到这次大会之间的时期，是考验统一行动联盟的最严重的时期之一，但是，两党都光荣地通过了这一考验。它们敲掉了敌人手中的诽谤武器。我们的敌人利用这一武器反对我们统一行动的政策，力图在劳动人民队伍中散布不和与分裂。我们两党政策的立足点是有区别的，我们也老老实实地承认这一点，但是，我们忠实而诚恳地行动，我们心里记住——正如你们记住的一样——放弃统一行动的政策将意味着放弃工人阶级斗争的指导原则。
    意社会党书记申柯米蒂在晚间会议上作报告时指出：社会党现有五十三万七千党员，在上届大会时则仅有五十一万九千党员。这些数字揭穿了敌人所创造的关于社会党的队伍继续“溶化”的鬼话。
    申柯米蒂谈到党的政策的一般问题时，指出中派和中派组成的社会党领导机构过去主张现在仍然继续主张劳动人民团结在意大利总工会的队伍中，斥责右派社会党徒众在职工会组织中的活动；批准与共产党统一行动联盟，维护社会党的自主。
