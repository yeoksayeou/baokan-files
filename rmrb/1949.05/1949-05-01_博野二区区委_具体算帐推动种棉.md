[Ji Zhong Electric] The Bo Ye Second District Party Committee carefully studied and implemented the cotton planting plan. At the village branch committee joint meeting, the accounting method was used to break down ideological concerns, which was very effective. They calculated and compared from many aspects: From the harvest point of view: each mu of cotton can produce 45 jin of lint cotton, at least equivalent to 360 jin of rice; in the same soil quality, if grain is planted, each mu can only produce 1.6 dou of grain, equivalent to 170 jin of rice. From the burden point of view: three jin of lint cotton is enough to pay public grain; while millet requires twenty-five jin. From the perspective of labor expenditure: from cultivation to harvest, a large crop requires seven workdays per mu, although cotton requires more hoeing, it does not require threshing, and seed collection is also saved, so it is also only seven workdays. Although repairing cotton and picking cotton takes time, these tasks can be done by women and children. From the perspective of drought prevention: in dry weather, cotton and peanuts are easy to plant. When planting cotton, each load of water can plant 60 plants, and each mu only needs 40 loads of water, which is enough. Six laborers can plant more than two mu in half a day. Comparing disease and pest resistance: cotton is not afraid of locusts; peanuts, in addition to being drought-resistant, also have five fears: not afraid of wind and sand, not afraid of hail, not afraid of locusts, not afraid of floods (water passing by does not matter). Only red spiders may cause harm, but other crops are more afraid of diseases and insect pests. After such calculation and comparison, the concerns about eating, burning, paying burdens, and fear of extra effort were overcome, so that the branch committees understood the benefits of planting cotton and peanuts.

    具体算帐推动种棉
    【冀中电】博野二区区委精密研究，实现种棉计划，在村支委联席会上，用算帐方法打破思想顾虑，收效很大。他们从多方面计算比较：从收获上说：种棉每亩可产皮棉四十五市斤，最低折米三百六十市斤；同等土质；如种谷每亩只产谷一石六斗，计折米一百七十市斤。从负担上说：三斤皮棉就够交公粮；而小米得二十五斤，从花费劳动上说：从耕种到收获，大庄稼每亩需七个工，棉花虽然锄的次数多，但不用打场，收种子也省下，因此也不过七个工，修理棉花和摘棉花虽费时间，但这些活妇女、儿童也能作。从防旱方面说：天旱地干，棉花、花生便于点种。点种棉花，每挑子水可点六十棵，每亩共用四十挑水即够，六个劳动力半天可点二亩多。从病虫害上比较：棉花不怕蝗虫；花生除了耐旱，还有五不怕：不怕风沙，不怕雹灾，不怕蝗虫，不怕水灾（水过一下不碍事）。只不过有火蛛可能为害，但别的庄稼是更怕病虫害的。经过这样计算比较，把顾虑吃、烧、交负担和怕多费工夫等思想都克服了，使支委认识了种棉花和点种的好处。
