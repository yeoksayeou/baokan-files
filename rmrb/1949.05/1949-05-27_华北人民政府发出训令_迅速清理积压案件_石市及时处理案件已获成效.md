[This Municipality News] On the 21st, the North China People's Government issued a directive to governments and judicial organs at all levels to implement the clearance and reduction of backlogged cases. The directive, based on inspection reports of judicial work in Huolu and Pingshan counties and other regions, pointed out that the backlog of cases has become a widespread phenomenon. In Huolu, 118 people were detained, with 92 cases unresolved; in Pingshan, 120 people were detained, with 107 cases unresolved; in the Taihang area in February, there were 3,131 civil and criminal cases, with 1,400 cases concluded and 1,731 cases remaining unresolved. The reasons for the backlog are mainly the weakness of the masses' understanding, inappropriate views and methods for handling cases, the fear of punishing the crimes of reactionaries, the indulgence of the masses' backward demands, and the failure to actively seek solutions to difficult issues.

The directive pointed out that to reduce the backlog of cases, efforts should be made in both accepting new cases and clearing old cases. When handling new cases, it is necessary to distinguish between the importance and urgency of the cases, determine the order of priority for handling them, and make decisive judgments on whether a case is established, not established, or should be mediated. The Beijing Municipal People's Court has an inquiry office, the Tianjin People's Court has a duty reception group, and the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court has a system of duty judges, all of which are good methods for handling cases in a timely manner every day. Litigants first go to the inquiry office or duty office, and after preliminary inquiries, when the case is generally understood, it is handled separately. Those who should not be prosecuted are persuaded to return to production; those who can be litigated but can be mediated are mediated; cases that cannot be mediated or are not suitable for mediation are then scheduled for processing. The result of adopting the above methods is significant. According to the statistics of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Court for one week on duty: a total of 66 cases were received, 36 cases were resolved on the spot, 3 cases were rejected, 1 case was transferred to another jurisdiction, 7 cases were transferred for resolution the next day, and only 19 cases were filed for processing.

The clearance of old cases should proceed from the interests of the people, handling them quickly and carefully. If the facts of the case are unclear, an investigation should be conducted immediately; if the facts are clear, research on the handling method should be expedited; if suspicion is insufficient or evidence is lacking, an explanation or release should be expedited. As long as a delaying attitude is not maintained, certain results will be achieved.

　　华北人民政府发出训令
  　迅速清理积压案件
    石市及时处理案件已获成效
    【本市讯】华北人民政府于二十一日向各级政府及司法机关发出训令，贯彻清理与减少积压案件。训令根据检查获鹿、平山二县司法工作及各地司法工作的报告，指出积压案件已成为不少地区存在的现象。获鹿押犯一百一十八人，未决者达九十二人；平山押犯一百二十人，未决者达一百零七人；太行区二月份民刑案件共三千一百三十一件，已结者一千四百件，未结者达一千七百三十一件。积压案件的原因，主要是群众观念薄弱，处理案件的观点与方法不适当，对反动分子的罪恶不敢处办，迁就群众的落后要求不敢结案，有疑难不积极设法解决等。
    训令指出：要减少积压案件，应从受理新案与清理旧案两方面着手。处理新案时，要分别轻重缓急，确定先后处理方针，成案、不成案、或进行调解，都需要当机立断。北平市人民法院设有问事处，天津人民法院设有值日收案组，石家庄市人民法院设有审判员值日制，每天及时处理案件都是很好的办法。诉讼人先到问事处或值日处，经过初步问讯，案情大体了解后，即分别处理；可以不起诉者，即动员说服，劝归生产；可以成为诉讼，但能调解者，即进行调解；调解不成，或非调解的案件，然后定期进行处理。采上述办法的结果，显著成效，据石家庄市人民法院一星期值日的统计：共收案六十六件，当场解决者三十六件，驳回三件，转移管辖者一件，移交次日结案者七件，成案办理者仅十九件。
    对旧案的清理，要从人民利益出发，迅速慎重处理，如案情不明者，即赶快调查；案情明了，即赶快研究处理办法；嫌疑不足和证据不足者，即赶快解释或释放。只要不持拖延等待态度，会收到一定成效的。
