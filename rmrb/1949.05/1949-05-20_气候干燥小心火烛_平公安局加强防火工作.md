　　Dry Climate, Beware of Fire
  　Ping Municipal Public Security Bureau Strengthens Fire Prevention Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] The weather is dry, and fire alarms have been frequent in Ping City recently. Twenty-five fire alarms occurred in April alone, exceeding the total number of fire alarms in February and March combined. From May 1st to May 17th, another thirteen fire alarms occurred. The Ping Municipal Public Security Bureau is strengthening fire prevention work based on the principle of "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." It is stipulated that in addition to the public security sub-bureaus conducting a general inspection of the electrical wires, stoves, and other potential fire hazards in each household and store during the first week of each month, publicity work will be particularly strengthened this month. Speeches will be given at mass meetings held by the district and street governments, and slogans will be projected in cinemas and theaters or written as large-character posters to awaken every citizen's attention to fire alarms and to be vigilant at all times. In addition, personnel are dispatched to investigate water sources, the water output of tap water faucets, and whether the emergency exits, fire escapes, emergency water tanks, fire extinguishers, and fire hydrants in various entertainment venues are in good working order, and corrections are made at any time for those that do not meet the regulations.
    After liberation, the majority of firefighters have established a new perspective of serving the people. They rotate shifts day and night, fully armed, and stand by at any time. If a fire alarm occurs nearby, they can arrive within five minutes of receiving the report and put it out in time. Therefore, among the thirteen fire alarms in the first half of May, eleven did not result in disaster, and the rapid deployment of the fire brigade was the main reason. (Zhong)

　　气候干燥小心火烛
  　平公安局加强防火工作
    【本报讯】天干气燥，平市最近火警频传，四月一个月间共发生火警二十五起，超过二、三两个月的火警总数，五月一日至十七日又发生火警十三起。平市公安局正本着“一分防火，胜于万分救火”的原则，加强防火工作。规定除各公安分局于每月的第一周内，普遍检查各住户商店的电线、炉火等有无易于起火的因素存在外，本月将特别加强宣传工作，利用各区街政府开群众大会时进行讲说，并在电影院戏院放映或书写大字宣传标语，以唤起每一个市民对火警的注意，随时警惕。此外又派员调查各处水源，自来水笼头出水量及各娱乐场所的太平门、太平梯、太平水缸、灭火器、消防栓等是否好用，对不合规定者随时加以纠正。
    解放后的消防队员，大部树立了为人民服务的新观点，每天昼夜轮流换班，全副武装，随时待发，如近处发生火警，接到报告后五分钟就可赶到，及时扑灭，所以五月上半月的十三起火警中十一次未成灾，消防队之出动迅速为主要原因。（仲）
