　　"Comrades Treat Us Better Than Our Own Brothers!"
  　A Record of Transforming Beggars and Thieves into Honored Servicemen
    Chen Qingmei
    The members of the labor brigade, who were beggars and thieves in Beiping City a month ago, have recently, after the tireless education and help of more than one hundred honored servicemen, made up their minds to voluntarily join the production brigade to build dikes along the Yellow River.

    In the first few days after the honored servicemen arrived at the labor brigade, the members saw them as sent by the government to supervise and control them, so they were emotionally resistant. However, through the honored servicemen's care and concern for them in daily life, their active approach to them, talking to them frankly and warmly, the psychological resistance and barriers were quickly eliminated. At meal times, the honored servicemen served rice for everyone and also brought food and dishes to the sick members. Some members were lazy and did not like to be clean, so the honored servicemen would especially fetch water for them, even washing the feet of individual students. In just a few days, the members unanimously felt that their initial view of the honored servicemen was completely wrong. They said, "The comrades treat us better than our own brothers!"

    In terms of leadership and management, the spirit of democracy was also fully developed. The company commander, platoon leader, and squad leader were all honored servicemen. The deputy company commander, deputy platoon leader, and deputy squad leader were all elected by the members themselves. In this way, in the process of leading learning and managing life, everyone realized that this was not a matter for the "officials," but for themselves.

    The sincerity and love of the honored servicemen deeply moved all the members, and cultural activities naturally became lively. Every day after dinner, everyone would gather on the field for a get-together. The honored servicemen taught them to sing various songs from the liberated areas, and the members would also sing some Erhuang tunes or tell a segment of storytelling with drum accompaniment, further bringing their relationship closer.

    Guo Duo (16 years old), a newspaper boy living at No. 8, Lane 5, Gongmenkou West Fourth, decided to participate in the Yellow River project after studying. He said, "Repairing the Yellow River is good for the people, I will definitely go, and in the future I want to be a factory worker." The day before he left, his eighty-year-old grandmother came to the brigade and cried when she saw him. But he earnestly persuaded her, "Don't cry, I'm going to work and earn money to send to you!"

    Miao Chunyu (a member of the Kuomintang), a Kuomintang army platoon leader who was taken in in Beiping, didn't talk about anything when he first arrived at the labor brigade. After the honored servicemen approached him, they learned that he still had bedding and clothes stored in a hotel on Handkerchief Hutong outside Chongwenmen. That day, the brigade's instructor, Liu, went there to retrieve the items and returned them to him intact, which greatly moved him. He said, "In the past, our 'officers' told us that the Communist Party was lying, but now I have seen it with my own eyes, and it turns out it is not the case!"

    In this way, the honored servicemen used the method of unity and education to transform the members of the Beiping City Labor Brigade, leading this group of people, who were parasites in society a month ago, onto the road of labor.

　　“同志们对待我们比亲兄弟还好！”
  　荣誉军人改造乞丐小偷记
    陈庆楣
    劳动大队的队员们，在一个月以前还是北平市的乞丐和小偷，最近经过一百多个荣誉军人不倦的教育和帮助，绝大多数都决心地自愿地参加了生产大队去黄河沿岸修堤。
    荣军同志刚到劳动大队的最初几天，队员们把荣军看成政府派来押管他们的，因此在感情上是对抗的。但经荣军同志在日常生活中对他们照顾关心，主动的接近他们，和他们谈心，有什么说什么，非常亲热，这样就把心理上的对抗和膈膜很快消除了。开饭时，荣军替大家盛饭，还为病号端饭端菜。有些队员懒惰成性，不爱清洁，荣军同志就特别为他打水，甚至替个别学员洗脚。这样没有几天，队员们就一致感觉到当初对荣军同志的看法是完全错误的。他们说：“同志们对待我们比亲哥弟兄还好！”
    在领导管理方面，也充分发扬了民主精神。中队长、排长、班长由荣军担任。副中队长、副排长、副班长全由队员自己来选举，这样在领导学习、管理生活的过程中，使大家认识到这不是“官家”的事，而是为了自己。
    荣军的真诚和友爱，深深感动了全体队员，文娱活动自然地活泼起来。每天晚饭以后，大家就在场子上联欢，荣军教他们唱解放区各种歌曲，队员们也唱些二簧小调或说一段大鼓书，相互之间的关系更加接近了。
    住在西四宫门口五条八号的小报童郭铎（十六岁），经过学习以后，决心要参加修黄河的工程。他说：“修黄河对人民有好处，我准去，将来我要做一个工厂工人。”临走前一天，八十多岁的老祖母到大队来，见了他就哭。但他正色的劝他说：“你别哭，我去做工，挣了钱寄给你！”
    在北平被收容的国民党军排长苗春雨（国民党员），初到劳动大队时什么都不谈，经过荣军和他接近，才知道他还在崇文门外手帕胡同的一家客店里存着被子和衣服。当天就由大队刘指导员去那边把东西取回来，原封不动的还给他，这一下可把他感动了。他说：“过去我们的‘长官’告诉我们说：共产党是哄人的，现在亲自看到了，原来不是这一回事！”
    荣军同志就这样用团结教育方法改造了北平市劳动大队的队员，把这群一个月以前还是社会中寄生的人们，带上了劳动的道路。
