　　[Zhangjiakou Dispatch] Our reporter Li Yi reports: The Chahar Provincial People's Government and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, due to Zhang Zonghua, a technician at the Zhangyuan Oil Press Factory, deliberately violating labor discipline, have decided to expel him and hope that the relevant parties who improperly handled this matter will conduct a review and recognition of their errors. Zhang Zonghua, a technician at the Zhangyuan Oil Press Factory, used returning to his hometown for marriage as a pretext on February 2nd, deceiving the factory leaders to request a ten-day leave. However, he overstayed his leave by three months without returning to the factory and without extending his leave. His intentional absenteeism is undoubtedly clear. On March 17th, the factory management accepted the request of the on-site employees and, in order to maintain normal production, requested the Chahar Enterprise Company (which leads the oil press factory) and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Enterprise Union Office to dismiss Zhang Zonghua. When the responsible comrade of the Enterprise Company inquired about this matter with Comrade Guo Qiang, director of the Enterprise Union Office, he was met with Guo's fierce opposition. Comrade Guo Qiang told the Enterprise Company and the employees of the oil press factory that dismissing workers meant losing the class stance, and he believed that the administration had no right to deal with worker issues. Therefore, Comrade Guo Qiang advocated that the oil press factory first hire a temporary technician to replace Zhang Zonghua's position. That is to say, Zhang Zonghua could resume work on the day he returned. Comrade Guo Qiang even claimed that the handling of this matter "had been approved by the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee." The responsible comrade of the Enterprise Company, under the mistaken idea of "it's better to avoid trouble," yielded to Comrade Guo Qiang's erroneous proposition on March 18th and hired a temporary worker to replace Zhang Zonghua's work. The Chahar Provincial People's Government and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions believe that both Comrade Guo Qiang and the Enterprise Company made mistakes in handling this issue and failed to recognize that Zhang Zonghua's absenteeism, which disregards labor discipline, is an intolerable phenomenon in production undertakings. Implementing democratic factory management does not mean abolishing labor discipline and allowing arbitrary absenteeism and slowdowns. Therefore, it has been decided to announce the expulsion of Zhang Zonghua and promote the temporary worker who replaced Zhang Zonghua to a formal worker. Furthermore, the relevant parties who improperly handled this matter are instructed to conduct an ideological review and recognition of their errors.

　　张垣榨油厂技工张宗华
  　违反劳动纪律　受到开除处分
    【张家口讯】本报记者李翼报道：察哈尔省人民政府及张家口市总工会，以张坦榨油厂技工张宗华蓄意违反劳动纪律，决定予以开除处分，并望对此事处理不当之有关方面检讨认识。张垣榨油厂技工张宗华，于二月二日，以回籍结婚为口实，蒙混工厂领导者，要求十日假期，但逾假三月仍未到厂，且未续假，其蓄意旷工，殆属无疑。三月十七日，榨油厂厂方接受在厂职工要求，并为维持正常生产，曾向察哈尔企业公司（榨油厂属该公司领导）及张家口市总工会企业工会办事处，要求将张宗华解雇。企业公司负责同志以此事就询于企业工会办事处主任郭强同志时，却遭到郭的激烈反对。郭强同志向企业公司及榨油厂职工说：解雇工人是失掉了阶级立场，他认为行政上没有处理工人问题的权利。因而郭强同志主张，先由榨油厂雇一临时技工，代替张宗华之职务。就是说，张宗华何日回来，何日即可复工，郭强同志且声称此事处理“已获张家口市委批准”，企业公司的负责同志，遂在“多一事不如少一事”的错误想法下，于三月十八日迁就执行了郭强同志的错误主张，雇请临时工人替代张宗华工作。察省人民政府及张家口市总工会以郭强同志及企业公司两方面处理这一问题都有错误，未能认清张宗华此种置劳动纪律于不顾的旷工行为，在生产事业上，是一种不能容忍的现象。实行工厂管理民主化，绝不是要废除劳动纪律，允许任意旷工、怠工。因此，乃决定宣布开除张宗华，将代替张宗华工作之临时工，提为正式工人。并责成对处理此事不当之有关方面从思想上加以检讨认识。
