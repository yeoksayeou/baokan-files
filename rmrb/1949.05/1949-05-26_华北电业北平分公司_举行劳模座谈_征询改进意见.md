　　North China Electric Power Beiping Branch
  　Holds Labor Model Symposium
  　Solicits Improvement Suggestions
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Electric Power Company's Beiping Branch held a labor model symposium yesterday (the 25th) to solicit opinions on the company's construction. Seventy-four labor models, including Song Zuopu, attended the meeting, along with over one hundred and twenty representatives from various sections and divisions of the company and the North China Enterprise Department. At the meeting, everyone provided many valuable suggestions for the company's construction. Worker Zhang Zhenguo suggested: the company should expand the blacksmith shop to manufacture iron materials needed by internal and external line work teams to save expenses. The remaining damaged high-voltage porcelain bottles in the Chenggen warehouse should also be considered for conversion into low-voltage porcelain bottles. Wang Liankui proposed: "I heard from individual electricity users that they reported the installation of electricity meters in March, but they have not been installed yet, which should be corrected." Li Yaohua said: "Cutting off electricity for overdue payments is correct, but they should first be persuaded to pay before cutting off the electricity." Feng Baoqi proposed: "Labor models should go deep into the masses of workers, so that everyone can improve, and all employees should also learn from the labor models." Subsequently, the manager synthesized everyone's opinions and asked everyone to provide more suggestions to the company in the future so that the company's production can be improved.

　　华北电业北平分公司
  　举行劳模座谈
  　征询改进意见
    【本报讯】华北电业公司北平分公司昨（二十五日）举行劳动模范座谈会，征询对公司建设意见。到会有劳动模范宋作圃等七十四人，公司各科股及华北企业部等代表共一百二十余人。会上，大家对公司建设提供了很多宝贵意见。工人张振国建议：公司应扩充铁匠房，制造内外线工作班需用之铁器材料，以节省开支。城根仓库现存之残坏高压磁瓶，亦应斟酌情形改充低压磁瓶使用。王连奎提出：“听到个别用电户反映，已在三月份呈报装置电表，但仍未装置，应当纠正。”李耀华说：“欠费截电是对的，但应先加劝说其缴费，然后截电。”冯保骐提出：“劳动模范要深入到工人群众中去，使大家都提高一步，全体职工也要向劳模看齐。”随后由经理综合大家意见，要求大家以后更多的向公司提供建议，使公司生产搞得更好。
