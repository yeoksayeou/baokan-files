The May Day mass rallies and demonstrations held around the world this year demonstrated the strong solidarity and immense power of the working people of all nations. From the people of socialist Soviet Union to the revolutionary workers of imperialist America, a common voice was issued on this day: to fight for peace and democracy, and against war. In the Soviet Union, the people celebrated May Day with new achievements on the labor front. The armed forces reviewed their strength in this international day of the working class, in preparation for the upcoming summer training. They demonstrated their determination and confidence in defending their socialist motherland and world peace in the Moscow parade and grand demonstration. In the capitals of the New Democratic countries, between 100,000 and 500,000 working people participated in commemorative meetings and demonstrations. Their pledge was: to fight for peace. In capitalist countries, the broad masses of working people, despite the bans, intimidation and sabotage of the reactionary governments and police, still solemnly and solemnly commemorated their festival. In Paris, more than one million people participated in a demonstration that lasted five hours. In Rome, workers braved the rain and held a mass rally of hundreds of thousands of people in People's Square. Although the British Labor government ordered a ban on demonstrations, workers in London still gathered in Kennington Square to listen to a speech by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. At the same time, the London Trades Council organized a rally in Trafalgar Square, and the assembled masses resolutely resisted the mounted police who attempted to disperse the meeting. The authorities in the Western occupation zones of Berlin dispatched military police and gendarmes to prevent demonstrations, but workers, staff, women, students and intellectuals broke through the blockade and arrived at the Lustgarten in East Berlin to participate in a commemorative meeting of more than 800,000 people. In addition, commemorations were also held in Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, and the liberated areas of Greece. The mass demonstrations in New York frightened the reactionaries into dispatching 50,000 police to "prevent disorder." The meeting in Tokyo was attended by 520,000 people. Secretary General of the Japanese Communist Party, Tokuda, spoke at the meeting, frequently interrupted by sustained applause and cheers. After the commemorative meeting, a moving demonstration was held.

The Enthusiastic Subscription of the Entire Soviet People to Government Bonds Once Again Proves the Infinite Potential of the Soviet Economy

On May 3, the Soviet Union issued the fourth post-war National Economic Restoration and Development Bond worth 20 billion rubles, with a term of 20 years. As soon as the government order was announced, a wave of subscriptions to government bonds swept across the Soviet Union. In just one day, subscriptions reached 21.691 billion rubles, exceeding the issue amount by 12 percent. The subscription campaign is still in full swing. The reason why the Soviet people are so enthusiastically competing to purchase government bonds is because they have a high degree of patriotism and have great trust in the Soviet government. They recognize that Soviet government bonds are different from the government bonds of all bourgeois countries that exploit the working people. Every penny that the Soviet government obtains from the people is used to defend and improve the welfare of the entire people. The issuance of this Soviet government bond and the resulting enthusiastic subscription campaign once again demonstrates the infinite potential of the Soviet economy, which is a powerful guarantee for completing the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule.

Soviet Peaceful Diplomacy Wins Victory; Four-Power Agreement to Lift Restrictions on Berlin

The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France issued a joint communiqué on May 4, announcing that the representatives of the four countries had reached an agreement on lifting various restrictions in Berlin and between the eastern and western occupation zones of Germany, and on convening a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German issue. The four-power agreement stipulates that various restrictions will be lifted on May 12, and that a four-power foreign ministers' conference will be held in Paris on May 23 to discuss the German issue. This round of talks began in February with diplomatic contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union, and an agreement was reached after more than two months of negotiations. The four-power agreement marks a victory for Soviet peaceful diplomacy, and shows the failure of the aggressive foreign policy of the United States after the war. The people of the world who oppose war and support peace will no longer allow the imperialist bloc to continue to delay the work of the foreign ministers' conference in discussing a peace treaty with Germany based on the Potsdam Declaration.

The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held in London in late April. British and Australian newspapers pointed out that the central topic of the conference was to discuss the suppression of national liberation movements in Southeast Asia. The issue of the Pacific Pact has been secretly exchanged views on at the meeting. The meeting also decided to provide military and loan assistance to the reactionary Burmese government, but with two conditions: first, that the Burmese government and the Karen reactionary elements reunite to oppose the people; second, that Burma return to the British Commonwealth. The London conference also discussed the future relationship between Britain and India. As a result, the Indian government decided to make India a so-called "independent" country within the British Commonwealth system. This matter, on the one hand, once again demonstrates the hypocrisy of the so-called "independence" of the reactionary Indian bourgeoisie headed by Nehru; but on the other hand, it also reflects that American imperialism is actively promoting India's gradual departure from Britain and embrace of American imperialism.

### 世界劳动人民五一示威  显示出无比的伟大力量

    世界劳动人民五一示威
    显示出无比的伟大力量
    今年“五一”节全世界各地举行的群众大会和示威游行，显示出一切民族劳动人民的强固团结和无比伟大力量。从社会主义苏联的人民群众到帝国主义美国的革命工人，在这一天发出了一个共同的声音：为和平与民主、为反对战争而斗争。在苏联，人民以劳动战线上的新成就来庆祝“五一”节，武装部队在这一国际工人阶级的节日检阅自己力量，迎接行将到来的夏季练兵。他们在莫斯科阅兵式和大示威游行中表现了自己保卫社会主义祖国和保卫世界和平的决心和信心。在新民主主义各国的首都，有十万到五十万不等的劳动人民参加了纪念会和示威游行。他们的誓言是：为和平而斗争。在资本主义各国，广大劳动人民不顾反动政府和警察的禁令，威吓和捣乱，依然隆重和庄严地纪念了他们的节日。巴黎有百多万人参加历时五小时的示威大游行。在罗马，工人们冒着大雨，在人民广场举行了数十万人的大集会。英国工党政府虽然下令禁止示威游行，但伦敦的工人们仍然群集刊斯特广场，倾听英共总书记波立特的演讲。同时，伦敦工会委员会又在特拉法尔广场组织了集会，与会群众坚决抗击了企图冲散大会的骑警队。柏林西占区当局出动军警宪兵来阻止示威，但工人、职员、妇女、学生和知识分子冲破封锁线，到达东柏林乐园广场，参加八十多万人的纪念大会。此外丹麦、比利时、瑞典、希腊解放区也都举行了纪念。纽约的群众示威游行，吓得反动派出动了五万警察来“预防扰乱秩序”。东京与会群众有五十二万人。日共总书记德田在会上演说，不时为经久不绝的掌声与欢呼声所打断。纪念大会后并举行动人的示威游行。
    全苏人民踊跃认购公债  又一次证明了苏联经济的无穷潜力
    苏联在五月三日发行了为期二十年的战后第四次复兴与发展国民经济公债二百亿卢布。政府命令刚刚宣布，全苏人民就掀起了认购公债的热潮。仅在一天后，认购额已达二百一十六亿九千一百万卢布，超过发行额百分之十二。认购运动现在还正在热烈进行中。苏联人民所以如此热烈地争购公债，是因为他们具有高度的爱国主义精神，对于苏维埃政府有极大的信任，他们认识苏联的公债不同于一切剥削劳动人民的资产阶级国家的公债。苏维埃政府从人民取得的每一文钱都用于保卫和提高全体人民的福利上。这一次苏联公债之发行与由此而起的热烈认购运动，又一次表明了苏联经济的无穷潜力，这是提前完成战后五年计划的有力保证。
    苏联和平外交胜利  取消柏林限制四国获协议
    苏美英法四国政府于五月四日发表联合公报，宣布四国代表关于取消柏林方面和德国东西占领区之间各种限制以及召开外长会议讨论德国问题一事已获得协议。四国协议规定各种限制于五月十二日取消，二十三日在巴黎召开四国外长会议讨论德国问题。此次会谈开始于二月间美苏的外交接谈，中经两个多月的折冲始获致协议。四国协议标志着苏联和平外交的胜利，说明了战后美国侵略性外交政策的失败。全世界反对战争、拥护和平的人民力量再不容许帝国主义集团对外长会议根据波茨坦决定讨论对德和约的工作继续怠工。
    英联邦总理会议四月下旬在伦敦举行，英澳报纸都指出这次会议的中心议题是讨论镇压东南亚民族解放运动。太平洋公约的问题已在会上秘密地交换过意见。会议也决定了以军火和贷款援助缅甸反动政府，但附有两个条件：第一，要缅政府和克仑族反动分子重新联合起来反对人民。第二，要求缅甸重回英联邦。伦敦会议也讨论了英印未来关系问题，结果，印度政府决定使印度成为英联邦体制内的所谓“独立”国。这件事，一方面再次表现了以尼赫鲁为首的印度反动资产阶级所谓“独立”的虚伪性；但另一方面也反映了美国帝国主义正在积极促使印度逐渐离开英国，而投向美帝国主义的怀抱。          【新华社北平七日电】
