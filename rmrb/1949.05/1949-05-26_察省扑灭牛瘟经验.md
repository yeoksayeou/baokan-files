The rinderpest in Chahar Province occurred in December of last year, spreading in over three months to 1,519 villages in eight counties including Duolun, Kangbao, and Baoyuan in northern Chahar, as well as fourteen counties including Chicheng and Longguan in Ji-Cha area, and Taibus Banner in Inner Mongolia. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 4,209 cattle died. Through the active efforts of the Chahar Provincial People's Government, and the strong assistance from the CPC Central Committee, the North China Government, and other parties, the rinderpest was completely eradicated in a short period of just over two months, completing the first large-scale rinderpest prevention and control work in Chinese history.

How was the rinderpest eradicated? (1) First, it was due to the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the North China and Chahar Provincial People's Governments, their concern for the interests of the masses, and their recognition of the seriousness of rinderpest, leading to vigorous prevention and control work. More than 1,000 cadres and armed guards at all levels participated in the rinderpest prevention and control work. Generally, veterinary epidemic prevention committees were established from the special district to the village level. Disinfection was carried out based on the conditions that the masses could achieve. (2) Turning around the cadres' neglect of rinderpest work. Initially, most counties neglected rinderpest prevention work and failed to earnestly implement the provincial government's instructions, which caused the rinderpest to continue to spread and expand. In order to correct this deviation, the provincial government publicly criticized it, and commended Chicheng County for its achievements in earnestly implementing the provincial government's instructions and preventing and controlling rinderpest. It also instructed the northern Chahar and Ji-Cha special districts to suspend grain transportation work, postpone requisition work, and stop land reform in areas where epidemic prevention teams arrived, in order to fully carry out rinderpest prevention and control. (3) Establishing leading organizations, unifying forces and actions, clarifying responsibilities, and improving working methods in a timely manner to improve work efficiency. The northern Chahar and Ji-Cha areas established rinderpest eradication headquarters and veterinary epidemic prevention committees to unify leadership and clearly divide labor. The People's Armed Forces Department was responsible for blocking traffic, inspection, and isolation work, while Party, government, and civilian cadres cooperated with the epidemic prevention teams to carry out prevention and control work. The northern Chahar epidemic prevention team had the right to command county and district cadres, and mobilize horses, unifying forces and actions. Huade proposed: whichever cadre fails to complete the tasks assigned by the epidemic prevention team will be held responsible; county-level responsible cadres have the right to represent the county party committee to command cadres of any department at the district level. When carrying out the work, the division of labor was also specified. County and district cadres were responsible for propaganda and mobilization, registration and issuance of immunity certificates, and follow-up inspections and other administrative work, while the epidemic prevention team was responsible for treatment, medicine production and other work, greatly improving work efficiency. (4) Giving play to the high enthusiasm of all personnel, especially the great role of technical personnel. The Chahar Provincial Epidemic Prevention Team No. 1 increased the number of cattle injected from 100 per day at the beginning to 3,000. Within seven days, it completed the injection of 20,967 cattle in Kangbao County. When the Epidemic Prevention Team No. 2 worked in the Ji-Cha area, two people injected 800 cattle a day. When they worked in Yanbei, two people injected 1,700 cattle a day, more than doubling the number. (5) Conducting in-depth propaganda and mobilization, breaking the masses' feudal superstitions, and dispelling the masses' ideological concerns. Due to the long-term rule and obscurantist policies of the Kuomintang reactionary government, most of the masses had strong feudal superstitions. After the outbreak of rinderpest, instead of actively preventing and controlling it, they burned incense, chanted scriptures, made wishes, and performed operas; some were heartbroken and at a loss. In addition, many masses had ideological concerns, fearing blood draws from cattle (because good cattle blood had been drawn during the enemy and puppet reactionary government era), fearing that injections would prevent cows from having calves, fearing money, fearing that investigating the number of cattle would increase the burden, and fearing struggles to distribute cattle, etc. Therefore, many masses falsely reported the number of cattle to avoid injections. In response to the above thoughts of the masses, we carried out propaganda and mobilization on one hand, and first gave injections to a group of activists to let everyone see the actual results. Then, the masses asked for injections one after another. Whenever cattle were concentrated, it was quick and complete, and the number of cattle injected almost exceeded twice the original reported number. (6) Overcoming the difficulties of transportation, medicines, and equipment. The provincial government sent two cars to northern Chahar and one to the Ji-Cha area. Later, due to the lack of gasoline, two more carts were sent to the Ji-Cha area. Northern Chahar provided all horses for the use of the epidemic prevention team. In order to overcome the shortage of medicine bags, glass bottles, scissors, and knives, each group used iron boxes, ordinary boxes, and lunch bags instead. In order to overcome the lack of metal syringe needles, when the needles were rolled back, they were sharpened and reused. Some physiological saline and incubators were also made by themselves, ensuring the smooth progress of the work.

However, there were still the following shortcomings in this rinderpest prevention and control work: (1) The provincial government lacked foresight. Although it had been estimated in advance that relatively serious epidemics might occur in northern Chahar due to the long-term devastation by the enemy, the understanding was not deep enough, and no prevention was taken. At the same time, due to the low scientific knowledge of cadres below the special district level and the lack of recognition of natural disasters, the report after the outbreak of rinderpest was too slow, resulting in extremely insufficient preparation work. (2) Some county and district cadres had a tendency to be unorganized and undisciplined. Except for Chicheng, which implemented the provincial government's instructions on blockade, isolation, and disinfection relatively well, other counties did not earnestly implement them, causing the rinderpest work to continue to spread and expand. In addition, the combination of administration, technology, and the masses was sometimes not good enough, which reduced work efficiency and caused omissions and waste of drugs. (3) The understanding and grasp of the epidemic situation was insufficient, making the work passive and neglecting one thing while attending to another. (4) There was a lack of follow-up inspections, and the consequences of treating sick cattle were unknown.

Based on the experience of this rinderpest prevention and control work, the epidemic prevention teams put forward the following opinions on the future veterinary epidemic prevention work in Chahar Province: (1) Establish an organizational structure. Under the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, add a livestock epidemic prevention department, and set up a serum manufacturing plant under the epidemic prevention department. Establish an epidemic prevention intelligence network for livestock epidemic prevention teams in each county and city. (2) The provincial government should establish a veterinary epidemic prevention training institute to train technical cadres. (3) Popularize epidemic prevention knowledge and improve the understanding and knowledge of cadres and the masses in preventing and controlling veterinary epidemics. (4) Implement regular preventive injections. (5) The North China Epidemic Prevention Department should produce a large amount of serum and vaccine to meet emergency needs. (6) Advocate raising domestic rabbits to meet the needs of producing "rabbit-adapted virus." (7) Inner Mongolia should strengthen rinderpest prevention and control work, because rinderpest has occurred in northern Chahar many times, mostly transmitted from Inner Mongolia.

　　察省扑灭牛瘟经验
    察省牛瘟于去年十二月发生，三个多月时间，蔓延至察北多伦、康保、宝源等八个县一五一九个村及冀察赤城、龙关等十四个县及内蒙太仆寺佐旗。据不完整的统计，共计死牛四二○九头。经察哈尔省人民政府的积极努力，及中共中央和华北政府等各方的有力援助，在短短的两个多月期间，牛瘟全部扑灭，完成了中国历史上第一次大规模的防治牛瘟工作。
    怎样把牛瘟扑灭的呢？（一）首先是由于中共中央和华北、察省人民政府的正确领导，关心群众利益，认识了牛瘟的严重性，以大力进行防治工作。参加防治牛瘟工作的各级干部及武装警卫人员达一千多名。由专署到村一般的都成立了兽疫防治委员会。根据群众能作到的条件，实行消毒。（二）扭转干部忽视牛瘟工作的思想。在起初，大部县份忽视防止牛瘟工作，未能认真执行省府指示，因而使牛瘟继续蔓延扩大。为了纠正这种偏向，省府公开的批评了这种偏向，对认真执行省府指示，防治牛瘟工作有成绩的赤城县则提出表扬。并指示察北、冀察两专区停止运粮工作，征收工作暂缓进行，防疫队到达之地区停止土改，以全力进行防治牛瘟。（三）建立了领导组织，统一力量和行动，明确职责，及时改进工作方法，提高工作效能，察北、冀察成立了扑灭牛瘟指挥部和兽疫防治委员会，统一领导，并明确分工，由人民武装部负责封锁交通、检查和隔离工作，党、政、民干部配合防疫队进行防治工作。察北防疫队有权指挥县、区干部，调动马匹，统一了力量和行动。化德提出：哪个干部完不成防疫队交付的任务，哪个干部负责，县级负责干部有权代表县委指挥区级任何部门干部。进行工作时，又具体的分了工。县、区干部负责宣传动员、登记发免疫证、善后检查等行政工作，防疫队负责治疗、制药等工作，大大地提高工作效能。（四）发挥了全体人员的高度积极性，特别是发挥了技术人员的伟大作用。察省防疫第一队，由开始一天注射一百头牛增到三千头，七天内，完成了康保全县两万零九百六十七头牛的注射。防疫第二队在冀察工作时，两个人一天注射八百头牛，到雁北工作时，两人一天注射一千七百头牛，提高了一倍多。（五）深入宣传动员，打破群众的封建迷信思想，解除群众的思想顾虑。由于国民党反动政府长期统治，和愚民政策，大部群众封建迷信思想浓厚，牛瘟发生后，不但不积极防治，反而烧香、念经、许愿、唱戏，有的则痛哭流涕，不知所措，另外，有许多群众思想上有顾虑，怕抽牛血（因为在敌伪反动政府时代，抽过好牛血），怕打了针不生小牛，怕要钱，怕调查牛数增加负担，怕闹斗争分配牛等等。因此，有很多群众虚报牛数，避免注射。针对群众以上的思想，一面宣传动员，一面先给一部积极分子先行注射，让大家看到实际成效，群众才纷纷要求注射，每当集中牛时，又快又齐全，注射的牛数几乎超过原报牛数的一倍。（六）克服了交通、药械的困难。省府派赴察北汽车两辆，冀察一辆，后因汽油缺乏，又增派冀察大车两辆。察北将所有马匹供给防疫队使用。为了克服药械囊、玻璃瓶、剪、刀的困难，各组均以铁盒、普通盒、饭包等代替，为了克服金属注射器针头的缺乏，针头卷回时，磨磨再用。并自制了些生理食盐水和保温箱。保证了工作的顺利进行。
    但在此次防治牛瘟工作中，还存在着以下的缺点：（一）省府预见性不足，虽然事先曾估计到：察北在敌人长期的摧残下，可能发生较严重的瘟疫，但认识的不够深刻，未加预防，同时由于专区以下干部科学知识低，对自然灾害识认不足，所以发生牛瘟后，报告的过于迟缓，致使准备工作极不充分。（二）某些县区干部存在着无组织无纪律的倾向，对省府封锁、隔离、消毒的指示，除赤城执行的较好外，其他县均未认真执行，致使牛瘟工作继续蔓延扩大。此外，行政、技术、群众结合有时不够好，以致降低了工作效率，发生了遗漏现象浪费了药品。（三）对疫情的了解和掌握不够，使工作处于被动，顾此失彼。（四）缺乏善后检查，病牛治疗后不知后果。
    根据此次防治牛瘟工作的经验，各防疫队提出了对察省今后防治兽疫工作的意见：（一）建立组织机构，在省府农林处下，增设家畜防疫处，防疫处下设血清制造厂。家畜防疫队，各县、市建立防疫情报网。（二）省府应该设立兽疫防治训练所，培养技术干部。（三）普及防疫知识，提高干部和群众防治兽疫的认识和知识。（四）实行定期预防注射。（五）华北防疫处应大量制造血清、疫苗，以应急需。（六）提倡养家兔，以应制“兔化毒”需要。（七）内蒙应加强牛疫防治工作，因察北历次发生牛瘟，多系由内蒙传染而来。
