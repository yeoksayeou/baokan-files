　　【Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 14th】 The Suzhou Military Control Commission and the People's Government have begun taking over the institutions of the Kuomintang reactionary regime. The units taken over include the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Government, which retreated to Suzhou from Zhenjiang, and its affiliated provincial training corps, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the four sections of secretariat, social affairs, personnel, and statistics, the pseudo-Second Administrative District Inspector's Office stationed in Suzhou, and the Wuxian County Government and its thirteen town reactionary regime institutions. The takeover work began on the 4th and is proceeding smoothly. Most of the old personnel of the various agencies, with the exception of the fleeing pseudo-provincial chairman, county magistrate, and senior officials, remained, totaling more than 220 people below the rank of section chief. When our army first entered the city, some middle-level officials, such as section chiefs, did not understand our policies well enough and hid at home, afraid to report for duty. After being summoned for talks and having the policies explained to them, they all complied with the order to prepare registers and submit them, handing over items one by one. Therefore, the archives, documents, and assets received were very complete. All the land registers and household registers of the Wuxian County Government were intact. Three hundred and sixty boxes and two hundred and twenty-four bags of important documents and archives of the pseudo-Provincial Government were taken by the Kuomintang bandit gang to Wujiang in an attempt to abscond with them, but they were also recovered by us. The People's Government has temporarily issued three catties of rice per person per day to the original staff and workers living in poverty to maintain their livelihoods.
　　
　　【Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station Broadcast】 Wuxi 15th dispatch: The Suzhou to Wuxi section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway has been restored to traffic on the 8th and has begun selling tickets. By this point, the Nanjing to Suzhou section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway is completely open to traffic.

    【新华社无锡十四日电】苏州军管会暨人民政府已开始接管国民党反动政权机构。被接收单位包括自镇江撤逃至苏州的伪江苏省政府及其所属之省训团、民政厅及秘书、社会、人事、统计等四个处，驻苏州之伪第二行政区督察专员公署，及吴县县政府与其所属的十三个镇反动政权机构。接收工作于四日开始，进行顺利。各机关旧有人员，除伪省主席、县长及高级官员逃走外，大部未走，计有秘书科长以下二百二十余人。我军初进城时，某些中级官员如秘书科长等，对我政策了解不够，匿居家中，不敢前来报到，后经召集谈话，解释政策，均按照命令，造具表册呈报，逐件点交，故接收之档案、文件、资财均甚完整。吴县县政府全部田亩册、户口册均完好无损。伪省政府重要文件档案三百六十箱及二百二十四袋曾被国民党匪帮带交吴江，企图卷走，亦被我追回。原有职员工人生活清苦者，人民政府已暂时发给每人每日大米三斤，维持生活。
