    Xinxiang Rapidly Resumes Work and Business
    Workers Determined to Build a New City
    [Our Newspaper] Since its liberation, under the active leadership of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government, Xinxiang City has rapidly restored its postal and transportation services, and industry and commerce have also resumed work and business one after another. On the third day of Xinxiang's liberation, postal workers throughout the city, in coordination with our postal personnel entering the city, began work, taking over and counting, sorting out accumulated mail, and delivering it separately. After postal services resumed with major cities across the country, thousands of letters and newspapers were delivered daily, all with care. The city's telephone system has also been repaired. Telecommunications workers connected the lines of major institutions in one day and one night, and repaired more than thirty lines throughout the city within three days. The workers are also automatically using waste materials to repair machinery, and their morale is extremely high.
    On the third day after our army entered the city, the Xinxiang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Military Control Commission, and the People's Government convened a forum for workers from all industries in the city. The workers all expressed their willingness to respond to the ardent expectations of the Communist Party and the government with practical actions.
    During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, nearly all of the city's more than two thousand factories and shops went bankrupt! After the People's Government entered the city, it conducted in-depth publicity of the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and helped industrialists and businessmen to resume work and business. As of the 13th of this month, statistics show that out of 26 factories in the city, including textile, soap, and glass factories, 19 have resumed work, and the rest are also organizing to resume production. At present, the city's smooth flow between urban and rural areas, the stability of social life, and the steady supply of daily necessities to the city's residents by state trade and economic agencies have all contributed to the steady decline of prices in the market.
    In addition: The Xinxiang Office of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has been established in Xinxiang City.

    工人们决心建设新城市
    【本报讯】新乡市自获得解放以来，由于军管会与人民政府积极领导，现邮电交通已迅速恢复，工业商业也纷纷复工复业。新乡解放之第三日，全市邮工即协同我入城邮务人员展开工作，一面接收清点，一面清理积压邮件，分别递送，与全国各大城市通邮开始后，每日往来邮件书报数以千计，均妥慎投递。市内电话亦已修复，电讯工人在一日一夜之间即将各主要机关线路接通，三天内并将全市三十余条线路修复，工人们更自动利用废料，修理机器，情绪极高。
    我军入城后第三日，中共新乡市委会、军管会及人民政府即召开全市各业工人座谈会，工人们都表示愿以实际行动，来回答共产党和政府的热望。
    该市工商业在国民党匪帮统治时，二千余家工厂商店，倒闭几尽！人民政府入城后，即深入宣传保护工商业政策，帮助各工商业家进行开工复业，截至本月十三日统计，该市纺织、肥皂、玻璃等二十六家工场，已有十九家复工，其余亦正组织复工生产。现该市以城乡畅通，社会生活安定以及国家贸易经济机关源源供给大批市民日用物品，市上物价均平稳下落。
    又讯：郑州铁路局新乡办事处已于新乡市成立。
