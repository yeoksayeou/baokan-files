　　Government Leads and Helps Solve Difficulties
  　Masses in Suburban Ping City Seize the Opportunity After Rain to Rush Planting
    [This Newspaper] After the rain on the 11th, the district governments of the 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 23rd, and 24th districts of suburban Beiping immediately led the farmers in their respective districts to make an all-out effort to rush planting. Most of it has now been completed. The area planted accounts for more than 80 percent of the total land. Some seedlings have already emerged. On the day it rained, the 16th district, including the Public Security Branch Bureau, organized a shock team of more than 300 people to help military families with farming, which had a great impetus. The farmers' morale has been greatly improved, and a rush of planting has been set off throughout the district. Most of the garden land has been planted, and dry land is still being spot planted. In the 5th administrative village of the 14th district, thirteen mutual aid groups (266 people) rushed to plant more than 1,000 mu in three days, and the entire district completed planting within five days. However, the cotton and peanut seeds in the 23rd and 24th districts have not yet been resolved. They are contacting the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government and the North China Finance and Economics Committee for loans, and they are scheduled to be planted within ten days. There were 20 foreign wells in the 23rd district, each of which could irrigate 5 qing of land, but due to years of disrepair, some boilers were broken, and some lacked parts and power. The Ministry of Agriculture is now being asked to send a well-digging team to inspect and provide loans for repairs. In terms of power, we have also contacted North China Electric Power Company to add lines and supply electricity, and 100 qing of land will soon be irrigated. (Chao Qi)

　　政府领导和帮助解决困难
  　平市郊各区群众趁雨后突击播种
    【本报讯】十一日下雨后，北平市郊第十四、十六、十七、十八、十九、二十、二十三、二十四等各区区政府即领导各该区农民全力突击播种。现已大部完成。播种亩数占全部土地百分之八十以上。有些已经出了苗。十六区在下雨的当天，即由公安分局等组织了三百余人的突击队，帮助军属耕种，起了很大的推动作用，农民情绪大大提高，因而全区掀起抢种的热潮。园子地大部已种上，旱地亦已继续点种。十四区第五行政村十三个互助小组（二百六十六人）突击三天，抢种一千余亩，全区五天内全部种完成。但目前二十三、二十四两区的棉籽和花生种仍未解决，正在分别向华北人民政府农业部和华北财经委员会接洽贷款、预定十天内种完。二十三区原有洋井二十个，每个能浇地五顷，但因年久失修，有坏了锅炉的，有缺乏零件和动力的，现正请农业部派造井队前往视察，并贷款修理。动力方面，亦已与华北电业公司接洽，添加路线，供给电力，一百顷的土地即将得到灌溉。（超祺）
