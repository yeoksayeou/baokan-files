    【Tianjin Dispatch】Following the conclusion of the North China Workers' Representative Conference, the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation convened a symposium on women workers' issues on the day after the conference (May 12th). More than 20 women worker representatives from Tianjin, Beiping, Tangshan, Eastern Hebei, Central Hebei, Taihang, Taiyue, Chahar, Central Shanxi, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Southern Hebei, among other places, attended, with more than 10 male worker representatives from various regions also present. At the symposium, Ding Yi, a representative from Tianjin, spoke, and tears welled up in her eyes as she talked about the various insults and oppressions suffered by women workers before liberation. Chen Wei, a 17-year-old woman worker representative from Shijiazhuang, said: After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, women workers at the Daxing Yarn Factory crawled under the machines during air raids, and as soon as the planes left, they immediately restarted the machines. In the competition, the women workers in the fine yarn department surpassed the male workers. Of the more than 70 production models in the entire factory, women workers accounted for 52. Chen Jiasen, a male worker from the Tianjin Rubber Factory, reviewed his past muddled thinking of looking down on women workers. Ma Suzhen, a 27-year veteran woman worker from a private tobacco company in Tianjin, said: "Things are different after liberation. Although I am over forty years old now, I still feel like I am in my twenties." Finally, Yang Zhiyi, Deputy Director of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke, saying: "Women workers' work is the most important work in the return-to-women movement. If this work is not done well, the entire women's movement will be affected. Factory women's work is part of the trade union's work. At present, we can experiment with the form of women workers' representative meetings and carry out work through the trade union as an auxiliary organ for educating women workers. At present, factories must let go and mobilize the masses to cultivate cadres among them. Welfare issues cannot be demanded too highly at present; we can first focus on running nurseries and cultural and educational undertakings."

    华北工代会议闭幕后
    召集女工代表座谈
    【天津电】华北职工总会筹委会暨全国民主妇女联合会，在华北职工代表会议闭幕之次日（十二日），召开女工问题座谈会，到有参加这次大会的天津、北平、唐山、冀东、冀中、太行、太岳、察哈尔、晋中、冀鲁豫、冀南等地女职工代表二十余人，并有各地男职工代表十余人列席参加。在座谈会上，天津市代表丁一发言，当她谈到解放前女工受尽种种侮辱和压迫时，热泪夺眶而出。石家庄十七岁的女工代表陈玮说：石家庄解放后，大兴纱厂女工在飞机轰炸时，爬在机器下，飞机一走，马上开车。在竞赛中细纱部女工赶过了男工，全厂生产模范七十多名，女工就占了五十二名。天津橡胶厂男工陈家森检讨了过去男工轻视女工的糊涂思想。天津某私营烟草公司二十七年老女工马素贞说：“解放后不同了，我现在虽然四十多岁了，但是我还象二十多岁的人呢。”最后，全国妇联女工部副部长杨之义讲话，她说：“女工工作在归女运动中是最主要的工作，这一工作做不好，整个妇女运动就受影响，工厂的妇女工作，就是工会工作的一部分。目前可以试验运用女工代表会的形式，通过工会来进行工作，作为教育女工的辅助机关。目前工厂必需放手发动群众，在其中培养干部。福利问题，目前不能要求太高，可先着重举办托儿所和文化教育事业。”
