　　Celebrating the Victorious Return of the Peace Delegation
　　The first group of more than 30 members of our country's delegation to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, led by head of delegation Guo Moruo, returned to Beiping yesterday. We extend our warmest congratulations to the entire delegation.
　　First of all, we thank you for speaking to the world what the people of North China and all of China wanted to say! Through your earnest promotion of the history of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in their struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and by exposing the US imperialist ambitions to invade China and announcing the demise of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, you have enabled the people of all countries to further understand how the Chinese people, after a long and arduous struggle, are about to reach final victory. This voice of the Chinese people has given great encouragement to the representatives of all countries attending the congress and to peace-loving people all over the world.
　　The struggle and victory of the Chinese people, especially the great victory of the People's Liberation Army advancing into the south of the Yangtze River and liberating Nanjing during the congress, stirred up enthusiastic cheers of "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!" in the two venues in Prague and Paris, filled with the deep friendship between the people of all countries. This is the glory of the Chinese people, and your glory too!
　　The great victory of the Chinese people has greatly strengthened the unity and confidence of the people all over the world. The Mongolian delegation, the African representatives, and the Soviet delegation all regarded the victory of the Chinese people as their own victory, as an important factor in striving for world peace. As Mr. Dabo Seye, a black man from Africa, said: "Mao Zedong is also the savior of the African people!" The head of the Mongolian delegation, Tsedenbal, said: "Now that democratic China has become the leader of the East, we, the Mongolian people, can rest assured!"
　　The achievements of this Peace Congress are great. We earnestly hope that you will promote the spirit of this congress and the practical actions to strive for world peace to the cities and villages of the entire North China, and use the strength of the people of the entire North China and the strength of the people of the entire China, to cooperate closely with the people of the world, to finally and completely destroy the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, liberate all of China, and crush the new war conspiracy of the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism.
　　In addition, you took the opportunity of attending the congress to visit the construction of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The valuable experiences of these countries are worth learning from and drawing on. Therefore, we hope that you will systematically and planned introduce them, so as to educate the broad masses of cadres and people, in order to facilitate the restoration and development of production and construction, and ensure the permanent victory of people's democracy and peace!

　　庆祝和平代表团胜利归来
    参加世界拥护和平大会的我国代表团第一批三十多人，在团长郭沫若率领下，已于日昨返抵北平。我们谨向代表团全体表示热烈的祝贺。
    我们首先感谢你们把华北人民以及全中国人民所要说的话，向全世界说出来了！经过你们切实宣扬了中国人民，以及中国人民解放军在中国共产党领导下，反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争史迹，并揭穿了美帝侵华野心，和宣布了国民党反动统治的灭亡，使世界各国人民进一步知道了中国人民是怎样经历了长期艰苦的斗争，而即将到达最后的胜利。--这个中国人民的声音，已经对出席和大的各国代表们，全世界爱好和平的人民，给予了很大的鼓励。
    中国人民的斗争和胜利，特别是正当大会期间人民解放军挺进江南解放南京的伟大胜利，在布拉格和巴黎的两个会场上卷起了全体代表的狂热的欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“中国人民解放万岁！”充溢着各国间人民的深厚友谊。这是中国人民的光荣，也是你们的光荣！
    中国人民的伟大胜利，大大增强了全世界人民团结的力量和必胜的信心。蒙古代表团、非洲代表以及苏联代表，都把中国人民的胜利当成自己的胜利，当成为争取世界和平的一个重要因素。如非洲的黑人达波赛先生所说：“毛泽东同时是非洲人民的救星！”蒙古代表团的团长齐登巴尔说：“现在民主中国做了东方的盟主，我们蒙古人民从此可以放心了！”
    这次和平大会的成就，是很大的，我们殷切地希望你们，把这次大会的精神，及争取世界和平的实际行动，推广到全华北的城市和乡村，用全华北人民的力量以及全中国人民的力量，和全世界人民密切合作，最后地彻底地摧毁国民党反动统治，解放全中国，粉碎以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的新战争阴谋。
    此外，你们乘出席和大之便参观了苏联及东欧新民主国家的建设，这些国家的许多宝贵经验，是值得我们学习和借鉴的。因此，希望你们有系统地有计划地加以介绍，借以教育广大干部和人民，以利恢复与发展生产建设事业，保证人民民主和平的永久胜利！
