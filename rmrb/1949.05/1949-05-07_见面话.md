"Agricultural Production" meets everyone!

Its task is to serve the peasants, to strive to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch," and to strive to realize the Huaibei Agricultural and Forestry Conference's policy of "increasing grain production to ensure military and civilian food needs; increasing cotton production to ensure factory operations"! Therefore, we must gradually raise our backward, ancient agricultural production technology in North China to the level of scientific and modern agricultural technology! We must carry out the improvement of technology as a mass movement! To achieve this, we are already initially equipped with the following conditions:

First, the inspiration of the victory of the people's revolutionary war, the great improvement in the peasants' production enthusiasm after the land reform, and the improvement of the masses' awareness through years of implementing "organization." This not only has the requirement to improve technology, but also makes it easier to accept and implement technological improvements.

Second, we have acquired large cities, have relatively complete agricultural scientific research institutions, as well as agricultural machinery factories and pharmaceutical factories that can improve agricultural technology, and also have many agricultural science experts who have been engaged in agricultural science for many years. This is our valuable capital and must be used well.

Third, in the past ten years, we have trained and cultivated many agricultural workers and experts in agricultural production and construction in the liberated areas, and also produced many outstanding labor heroes and technical experts. They are the backbone of agricultural technical work, and they not only have rich agricultural production experience, but also deeply understand what farmers need and do not need in terms of technology.

With these, we need a good occasion to organize and exchange agricultural scientific knowledge and technical experience, so that it can better serve agricultural production! "Agricultural Production" gloriously undertakes this great task, writing things that are practical and easily accepted by the masses according to the agricultural season and agricultural activities. At the same time, in order to continuously improve the technical level, we must also publish things like agricultural scientific research. Broadcast these valuable agricultural knowledge and experience to every corner of the countryside, fully utilize them, and free farmers' production from backward and pitiful situations!

Agricultural scientists, agricultural workers, labor heroes, and production technology experts in various places, let's all get to work and actively contribute to "Agricultural Production" to enrich it! Readers in various places should actively provide suggestions for improvement with the enthusiasm of cherishing the Party newspaper and the spirit of being responsible to the people.

    见面话
    “农业生产”和大家见面了！
    它的任务，就是为农民服务，为响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召而奋斗，为实现华北农林会议“增产粮食保障军需民食；增产棉花保证工厂的开工”方针而奋斗！因此就必须把我们华北农业生产的落后的古代的农业生产技术，逐渐提高到科学的近代化的农业技术水平上来！把提高技术当作一个群众运动开展起来！作到这一步，我们已初步具备了这些条件：
    第一、人民革命战争的胜利的鼓舞，与土地改革后农民生产情绪的大大提高，和多年实行“组织起来”群众觉悟程度的提高。这不但有提高技术的要求，而且易于接受与实行技术的改进。
    第二、我们取得大城市，有了比较完善的农业科学研究机关，也有可以改进农业技术的农械工厂和制药厂，也有了不少的多年从事农业科学专家。这是我们宝贵的资本，必须很好的使用起来。
    第三、我们十年来在解放区的农业生产建设中，锻炼与培养了许多的农业工作者与专家，也涌现了许多出色的劳动英雄与技术能手，这是农业技术工作的骨干，他们不仅有丰富的农业生产经验，而且也深刻地了解农民在技术上需要什么，和不需要什么。
    有了这些，就需要我们有很好地组织交流农业科学知识和技术经验的场合，使之更好的为农业生产服务！“农业生产”就光荣的担负起这个伟大的任务来，按照农事季节，农事活动，写一些切合实际需要的，又易于为群众接受的东西，同时为了不断的提高技术水平，也必须发表一些农业科学研究一类的东西。把这些宝贵的农业知识和经验，广播到农村的各个角落里，充分的运用起来，使农民生产摆脱了落后的可怜的境遇！
    各地的农业科学家、农业工作者、劳动英雄和生产技术能手们，一齐动起手来，积极的为“农业生产”写稿，使之充实起来！各地读者要一本爱护党报的热忱，为人民负责的精神，积极提供改进的意见。
