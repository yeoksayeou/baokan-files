　　Repairing the Shihe Iron Bridge

　　The Shihe Bridge is the second largest bridge on the Guannei section of the Beining Railway, second only to the Luanhe River Bridge, and is a crucial link for transportation between Qin and Yu. This bridge was built in the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), with finished components ordered from Britain and assembled by the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory over three years. Last November, when the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated, they destroyed three spans of the bridge. After the liberation of Qin and Yu, the bridge was temporarily opened to traffic with rails laid on gravel and sleepers. Formal repairs began on February 23rd of this year, manufacturing several components such as end posts, columns, and crossbeams, using a total of 108 tons of new steel and approximately 90 tons of steel for repairing existing parts. In addition, four new cast iron movable bridge seats and two fixed bridge seats were manufactured, using a total of 15.8 tons of cast iron. The entire project was carried out by assembling, disassembling, connecting, and riveting at the site, with manufacturing or repairs done in the factory. Thanks to the active work of the workers and the assistance of the Railway Corps, the project overcame various difficulties and was successfully completed on April 19th. During the bridge repair planning, the factory was affected by the Kuomintang's plot to relocate the factory before liberation, and all engineering drawings were lost, which added some difficulty to the repair work. However, the enthusiastic comrades in the planning department, with the assistance of the workers, quickly completed the on-site surveying and mapping work and formulated the entire repair plan (excluding the seven bridge spans that were later added for repair). After discussions between the factory, a bridge team, the engineering section, and the engineering bureau, construction began. After the project started, a temporary difficulty arose regarding materials (a lack of half-inch-thick crossbeam web plates and five-tenths-of-an-inch-thick end post large connecting plates). Later, the materials section inspected the steel plates that the former Kuomintang had transported away from the factory at Xinhe and discovered that there were half-inch-thick large steel plates, sufficient to meet the needs of restoring the entire bridge's crossbeams, which were quickly transported back. The large connecting plates at both ends of the end posts were made from the web plates of large steel beams newly transported from the Northeast. Other parts were made by saving materials as much as possible, making maximum use of old materials. Secondly, in terms of casting steel bridge seats, because the factory had no steel casting equipment, it was decided after research that cast iron materials could be used instead, and safety could be guaranteed, so cast iron bridge seats were used. Furthermore, because the ninth and tenth spans were the most heavily damaged, seven crossbeams were added for repair during the project, achieving sturdiness and perfection.

　　To support the army's southward advance, the workers demonstrated a high degree of awareness in their work. For example, riveting workers who previously (under Kuomintang rule) averaged 60 rivets per person per day now rivet more than 100. Gas welders Bai Delin and Jin Baowen helped others work in addition to their own work. Meng Zhaohan, a transportation worker, carried one end of a 300-jin angle steel alone, while others carried it with two people. Thanks to the active efforts of all employees, all the chipping and transporting work was completed on March 8th. Nearly ten thousand rivets were removed, and the loading, unloading and bridge jacking work was completed continuously. Sporadic repair work began on March 4th, with the construction of three main girder vertical columns and one diagonal column for the third span, one vertical column for the eighth span, and the reinforcement work for the crossbeam of the sixth span, as well as other sporadic repair work, which was completed ahead of schedule on March 19th along with the main project. The factory's fabrication work began on February 26th, scheduled to be completed on March 25th, and was completed ahead of schedule on March 20th. The entire project used a total of 4,070 workdays, saving more than 700 workdays compared to the original plan of 4,800 workdays, and was completed as scheduled on April 19th.

### 修复石河铁桥

　　修复石河铁桥
    石河桥是北宁铁路关内段仅次于滦河的大桥，是秦榆间交通的重要关节。此桥兴修于民国十一年，由英国定购成品，经山海关桥梁厂铆合三载始成。在去年十一月国民党匪军撤退时，曾炸毁该桥桥梁三孔。秦榆解放后、乃暂以砂石和枕木铺轨通车。今年二月二十三日正式开工整修，自制端柱、立柱、横梁等多件，共用新钢料一百零八吨修理部分用钢约九十吨。此外，新制生铁活动桥座四个，固定桥座两个，用生铁计十五点八吨。全工程进行的方式是工地装拆接铆、厂内配制或修理。该工程在工友们积极工作和铁路兵团的协助下，克服多方困难，终于四月十九日胜利完成。此桥在修复计划中，因该厂在解放前曾受国民党迁厂阴谋的影响，一切工程图案皆因而遗失，这给修复工作增加了部分困难。但热情的计划科的同人们，在工友的协助下，短期间内即完成了工地测量和制图工作，拟定了全部修复计划（后追加修理的七个桥梁除外），经本厂与一支桥梁队、工务段及工程局的工程人员讨论后，开始动工。工程开始后在材料方面曾一时发生了因难（缺乏半英寸厚的横梁立板料和五分厚的端柱两端大联系板料），后经材料科去新河查点该厂前国民党运走的钢板，发现其中有半英寸厚的大钢板，足应恢复全桥横梁的需要，乃迅速运回；而端柱两端的大联系板料，则利用了从东北新运来的零段大钢板梁的立板料；其他部分则本着节省物质的原则，尽量地利用旧材料。其次，在铸钢桥座方面，因该厂无铸钢设备，后经研究可以生铁料代替，且能保证安全行车，故采用了生铁桥座。再，因第九、第十两孔破坏最重，于工程中途曾追加修理横梁七个，达到了坚固和完美。
    为了支援大军南下，工友们在工作中发挥了高度的自觉性，如铆钉工人从前（指国民党统治时）每人每天平均铆六十个，现在铆到一百多个。瓦斯匠白德林、金保文在自己工作外，还帮助别人工作，运搬工孟昭汉，一条三百斤的角钢，别人两个人扛一头，他一个人扛一头。由于全体职工的积极努力，三月八日便完成了全部铲钉和拆运工程。铲除全部近万数之铆钉，并连续完成了装运和起桥工作。零星的修理工作，自三月四日起始，动工计第三孔主桁直立柱三个，斜柱一个，第八孔直立柱一个和第六孔横梁的补强工作以及其他零星的修理工作，随带着主要工程于三月十九日提前完成。厂内配制工程自二月二十六日动工，预定三月二十五日完成，于三月二十日即提前完工。全部工程共用四千零七十个工，较原计划的四千八百工，省下七百余工，于四月十九日如期完成。
