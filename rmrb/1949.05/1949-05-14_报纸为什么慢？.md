    Why Are Newspapers Slow?
    Our bureau has recently received many letters from readers forwarded by the People's Daily, inquiring about the slowness and irregularity of the newspaper since the People's Daily moved to Beijing for publication. In addition to apologizing to our readers, we are briefly explaining the main reasons as follows:
    Since before the liberation of Beiping in December last year, our bureau has been actively planning to establish a postal route between Beiping and Shijiazhuang. It was not until January that the Ministry of Communications decided to have the Shijiazhuang Transportation Company send vehicles between Zhuoxian and Shijiazhuang to transport mail. A trial run was conducted on the 22nd, and formal service began on the 31st. However, due to the company's lack of vehicles, daily shifts could not be implemented, and transportation was only possible every other day. It took three or four days for Beiping mail to reach Shijiazhuang. From February 12th to February 20th, transportation was suspended for nine days due to vehicle damage, resulting in a backlog of 3,200 kilograms of newspapers and mail in Zhuoxian. Through the efforts of our bureau in transferring vehicles and the efforts of the Highway Administration and the company, the schedule returned to normal and the backlog decreased. However, since March, various books and newspapers have been published in Beiping, and postal services have been established with various liberated areas and Chiang-occupied areas, resulting in a sharp increase in mail volume. On average, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms of mail and newspapers are transported south from Beiping each day; however, the vehicles, running every other day, can only transport slightly over 1,500 kilograms. Therefore, every other day, a backlog of 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms accumulates. In addition to reporting this to the government for resolution, our bureau has repeatedly tried to find solutions, dispatching special personnel to Zhuoxian to assist in the work, prioritizing the sealing and forwarding of newspapers and official documents, and once again transferring vehicles for expedited transport; however, due to limited resources, the backlog could not be overcome. It was not until April 18th that the Ministry of Communications approved the formation of a motor vehicle postal transport team by the Highway Administration to be responsible for the transportation of mail between Zhuoxian and Handan. By the 22nd, all the accumulated mail in Zhuoxian had been transported. The schedule is now normal, with daily round trips between Zhuoxian and Handan. If the newspaper can be published and delivered to the post office before 8:00 AM, it can arrive in Baoding on the same day, Shijiazhuang in two days, and Handan in three days. It is currently one day late.

### 报纸为什么慢？

专栏：询问答复

    报纸为什么慢？
    近接报社转来不少读者信件，询问自人民日报移平出版后，为什么速度迟慢和不正常等。除向读者致歉外，特将其主要原因简复如次：
    自去年十二月北平未解放前，敝局即积极筹划建立北平至石家庄的邮线，直至一月份才经交通部决定由石家庄运输公司派车往来涿县与石家庄间运送邮件。廾二日试车，三十一日正式通达，但因公司车辆缺乏，不能实行日班，只好每隔一天运送一次，北平邮件需三或四天方可到达石庄。至二月十二日到二十日九天中，因公司车辆损坏，不能运输，以致报纸邮件积压涿县，达三千二百公斤之多。经敝局抽调车辆运送及公路总局与公司的努力，班期才告恢复正常，积压减少。但自三月以来，各种书报纷纷来平出版，又与各解放区与蒋占区通邮，故邮件激增。每日平均由平南运之邮件报纸等约达一千五百至二千公斤；而汽车两日一次，仅能运走一千五百余公斤。故每隔一天，即积压一千至二千公斤。敝局除报请政府解决之外，虽一再设法，特派专人到涿县协助工作，尽先封转报纸及文令函件，并再次抽调汽车赶运；但终因力量所限，积压不能克服。直至四月十八日才由交通部批准，由公路总局组成一汽车邮运队，来负责运送涿县邯郸之来往邮件。二十二日已将涿县所积存之邮件全部运完。现在班次正常，每日由涿县至邯郸对开一次。若报纸能改在八点以前出版送达邮局，则当天到保定、二天到石庄、三天即可到达邯郸，现在慢一天。      华北邮电总局五月十日
