　　Defend Peaceful Construction
　　Eliminate Bandit and Special Agent Activities
    North China has been completely liberated. Our task from now on is to carry out peaceful production and construction. Many Kuomintang remnants, bandits, special agents, scattered soldiers, and saboteurs mixed in with returning villagers are hiding in various places or urban departments, taking the opportunity to carry out sabotage. We must thoroughly eliminate these hidden enemies in order to defend production and construction.

    In newly liberated areas and semi-old areas where our mass work is weak, the enemy intimidates and uses the masses, colludes with secret societies, bandits, and local tyrants and evil gentry to sabotage support for the front, conscription, oppose land reform, oppose the collection of public grain, and murder the masses and cadres. The incident in Caoxian County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, is a very obvious example.

    To eliminate bandits, special agents, and saboteurs, the first step is to deeply mobilize the masses and closely cooperate with the public security departments and the militia's security work. In new areas, it is difficult to carry out security work and mobilize the masses. Only on the basis of full mass mobilization can the social security of the liberated areas be truly consolidated. In factories, workers should be organized to form their own pickets to protect factory machinery. Each department, factory, institution, and school, especially economic departments, should be responsible for their own security and internal management, and should not rely solely on troops and police. As for secret societies in rural areas, they must be strictly banned. The North China government's order of January 4th banning secret societies must continue to be implemented, and the misled masses must be educated in various ways. In dealing with this issue, the causes must be specifically analyzed, whether they are economic or political, and then dealt with separately.

    Cadres and the masses in all levels of organizations, departments, factories, and schools must fully recognize that after the open enemies are defeated, special agents and saboteurs will inevitably strengthen their hidden activities. In carrying out the great cause of peaceful construction, we should always be vigilant.

　　保卫和平建设
  　肃清匪特活动
    华北区已全部解放，今后我们的任务即是进行和平的生产建设。土崩瓦解的国民党、匪特、散兵游勇和混入还乡人员中的破坏分子不少的隐蔽在各地或城市的部门内乘机进行破坏，我们必须彻底肃清隐蔽的敌人才能保卫生产建设。
    在新区和半老区我们群众工作薄弱的地方，敌人恐吓利用群众，勾结会门土匪及地富破坏分子，破坏支前、参军，反对土改，反对征收公粮，杀害群众及干部，冀鲁豫河南曹县事件是很明显的例子。
    肃清匪特及破坏分子首先是深入发动群众，并与公安部门、民兵的治安工作密切的配合起来。在新区不注意治安工作、发动群众是困难的。也只有在群众充分发动的基础上，解放区社会治安才能得到真正巩固。在工厂则应组织工人成立自己的纠察队，保卫工厂机器，各个部门、工厂、机关、学校，特别是经济部门应自己负责警卫并检查管理自己的内部，不能只单纯的依靠部队、警察。至于农村中的会门必须严予取缔，继续贯彻一月四日华北政府取缔会道门的命令，并多方教育被迷惑的群众。在处理这一问题时必须具体分析产生的原因，是属经济的还是政治的，然后予以分别处理。
    各地机关、部门、工厂、学校、干部群众，必须充分的认识在公开的敌人被打倒以后，特务破坏分子必然会加强其隐蔽活动，在进行伟大的和平建设事业中，应该时刻提高警惕。
