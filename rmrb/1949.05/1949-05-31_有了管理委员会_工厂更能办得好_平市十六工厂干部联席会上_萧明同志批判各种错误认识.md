With a Management Committee
    Factories Can Be Run Better
    At the Joint Meeting of Cadres from Sixteen Factories in Beiping
    Comrade Xiao Ming Criticizes Various Erroneous Understandings
    [Our Newspaper] In order to implement democratic factory management, the Beiping Municipal Enterprise Bureau specially convened a joint meeting of administrative and trade union cadres from sixteen factories under its jurisdiction yesterday (the 30th), including the Water Company, Tram Company, and Pingxi Coal Mine Company, with more than 80 people attending. Comrade Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrade Zhang Hongshun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Industrial Trade Union, were present. Representatives from various factories initially examined the extent of the implementation of democratic factory management and certain ideological deviations on this issue, criticized the erroneous understanding of some people who believed that it was unnecessary to establish a factory management committee, or that the establishment of a factory management committee would lead to uncoordinated leadership; and also criticized the shortcomings of some factory management committees that were merely a formality, not integrated with workers, or had only one worker representative, and were not genuinely elected. After reviewing themselves, each unit also provided some suggestions to the leadership. Based on everyone's statements, Comrade Xiao Ming first explained that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, the Enterprise Bureau, and the administrative side should achieve unified planning and consistent steps in the future, and hoped that the factories would do the same. Secondly, he pointed out: Some comrades believe that the original administrative, trade union, and branch organizations in the factory are already somewhat uncoordinated. If management committees, security committees, and workers' representative meetings are added, it will become even more uncoordinated. This understanding is wrong. On the contrary, with these organizations, the factory can be run better. Anyone who thinks that a factory only needs one organization is as ridiculous as saying "a person only needs one head and nothing else." Finally, he pointed out: The factory management committee is not the highest authority in the factory, nor is it a concentrated manifestation of democratic factory management. It is an organization under the leadership of the factory director or military representative, a democratic and centralized system. The branch secretary is not the party representative of a factory, but mainly mobilizes and educates all party members to play a backbone leading role and guarantees the completion of tasks assigned by higher authorities and the factory. After Comrade Xiao Ming's speech, Director Mu of the Enterprise Bureau made a conclusion to the meeting. After making appropriate criticisms and corrective measures on the more or less uncoordinated phenomena existing in various factories' administration, trade unions, and branches, he emphasized that the factories should implement the policy of enterprise democratic management and called on cadres to study hard.

　　有了管理委员会
    工厂更能办得好
    平市十六工厂干部联席会上
    萧明同志批判各种错误认识
    【本报讯】北平市企业局为贯彻工厂管理民主化，特于昨日（三十日）召集所属自来水公司、电车公司、平西煤矿公司等十六个工厂的行政及工会干部联席会议，到八十余人。市职工总会筹委会主任萧明同志，产业职工会筹委会主任张鸿舜同志均出席。各厂代表在会上初步检查了贯彻工厂民主管理的程度及思想上对这一问题存在的某些偏差，批判了某些人认为工厂管理委员会不需要成立，或认为有了工厂管委会即会造成领导不协调等错误认识；也批判了某些厂的管委会徒具形式，未与工人结合，或只有一个工人代表，且非认真选举产生等缺点。各单位在检讨自己后也向领导上提供了一些意见。萧明同志根据大家发言，首先说明市职工筹委会与企业局和行政方面今后要取得计划统一，步调一致，希望各厂也这样做。其次指出：有些同志认为工厂原有行政、职工会、支部等组织就有些不协调，如再增加管委会，保卫委员会、职工代表会的组织，就会更加不协调，这种认识是错误的。相反的，有了这个组织，工厂更能搞的好。谁要认为工厂只要一个组织就可以了，那就好比说“一个人只要一个脑袋，别的都不需要”一样的可笑。最后提出：工厂管理委员会不是工厂最高权力机关，也不是工厂民主管理的集中表现，而是在厂长或军事代表领导下的组织，是一个民主而又集中的制度。支部书记不是一个工厂的党的代表，而主要的是发动教育所有党员起骨干带头作用，保证上级和工厂任务的完成，萧明同志发言后，由企业局牟局长对会议做出结论。他对各工厂或多或少存在的行政、职工会、支部不协调等现象做了适当的批判和纠正办法以后，强调各工厂要贯彻企业民主管理化的方针，号召干部要好好学习。
