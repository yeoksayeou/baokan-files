　　Ping City has Few Diseases This Spring
  　Reason: Good Epidemic Prevention Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Ping City Health Bureau has achieved excellent results in its spring epidemic prevention work. Since the beginning of spring, the bureau's epidemic prevention teams, health education section, mobile medical teams, urban and suburban health centers, and affiliated hospitals have gone deep into workers' dormitories, impoverished areas, schools, organizations, and various public places to promote epidemic prevention work. From March 16th to May 21st, they vaccinated 257,499 people against smallpox. They repeatedly persuaded and educated the masses about the typhoid fever vaccine. As of May 23rd, over 70,000 typhoid fever vaccinations had been administered (one, two, or three injections per person). The affiliated hospitals and health centers also vaccinated citizens against diphtheria, with nearly 6,000 people already vaccinated. From March 1st to May 17th, they sprayed D.D.T. containing 10% powder in various public places, covering over 4,000 people and over 17,000 beds. All these epidemic prevention injections were free. The low incidence of epidemics this spring is largely due to this epidemic prevention work.

　　平市今春疾病少
  　原因是防疫工作好
    【本报讯】平市卫生局春季防疫工作获良好成绩。入春以来，该局所预防疫班、卫生教育股、巡回医疗队、城郊区卫生所及附属医院等，曾深入工人宿舍、贫民区域、学校、团体以及各个公共场所，推动防疫工作。从三月十六日起至五月二十一日止，给二十五万七千四百九十九人种了牛痘，他们为注射防疫伤寒针，曾向群众一再说服教育，截至五月二十三日，注射伤寒针的已有七万余次（一人注射一次二次或三次）。各附属医院及卫生所并向市民注射防预白喉针，有近六千人已经注射了。他们从三月一日到五月十七日，到各群众场所喷射含有百分之十粉剂的Ｄ·Ｄ·Ｔ，共有四千多人体和一万七千多床位已经喷射。这种防疫注射都是免费。今春少有流行病，这种防疫工作起了相当大的作用。
