　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th -- Of the sixty-nine factories under the Paper, Rubber, Cement, and Ceramics Corporations and the Fushun Industrial Institute, all under the Enterprise Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee's Industry Department, forty-three factories have resumed production. The Paper Corporation has jurisdiction over sixteen factories, thirteen of which have resumed production. The current products of various factories include more than ten types of paper such as newspaper, imitation paper, and glazed paper, with an average daily output of more than sixty tons, guaranteeing the needs of publishing, cultural and educational undertakings, and various institutions and industries in Northeast China. The main raw materials for the paper industry, such as wood and reeds, are extremely abundant in Northeast China. The factories are now actively studying and improving technology and equipment to fully utilize the superior resource conditions and continuously improve the quality and quantity of paper. In the rubber industry, except for individual factories that are still recovering due to severe damage by the Kuomintang, the rest have all resumed production. This year's plan is to produce more than 10,000 sets of automobile tires (inner and outer), 153,000 sets of rickshaw tires (inner and outer), 660 million "Blai" of transmission belts (for factories and mines) (a unit for calculating belts, i.e., 1.5 cm thick, 1 inch wide, and 1 foot long), 4.475 million pairs of rubber shoes, and tens of thousands of various rubber hoses, gas masks, raincoats, etc. Based on the current production efficiency of the factories, it is guaranteed that the above plan will be completed this year. For example, Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4 exceeded the production plan by 30% in March, and Factory No. 6 exceeded it by 44%. Most other factories have also completed and exceeded their plans. Of the factories under the Cement Corporation, three have resumed production, and the products are mainly supplied for railway transportation and other construction purposes. The Ceramics Corporation has twelve factories, most of which have also resumed production. The produced porcelain and refractory bricks are mainly supplied for electrical (insulators) and smelting industries. The large-scale Shenyang Glass Factory is now concentrating its efforts on restoration. The power generation furnace and power distribution system project have been largely completed, and production can begin in August this year. It is expected that the factory may reach the highest annual output of 480,000 cases (100 square feet per case) during the puppet Manchukuo period next year. At present, there is still a general phenomenon of waste in the above-mentioned factories, resulting in higher product costs. Therefore, in addition to stepping up restoration work this year, the central task of each factory is to reduce costs and improve quality.

　　东北造纸橡胶水泥陶磁
  　四十三个厂已恢复生产
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】东北行政委员会工业部企业管理局所属造纸、橡胶、水泥、陶磁四大公司及抚顺工业所共六十九个工厂中，已有四十三个厂恢复生产。造纸公司共辖十六个工厂，已有十三个工厂恢复生产。现各厂出品有报纸、模造纸、有光纸等十余种，每日平均产六十余吨，保证了东北出版、文化教育事业及各机关、工商业用纸的需要。造纸工业的主要原料如木材、芦苇等，东北境内极为丰富，各厂现正积极研究改进技术与设备，以充分利用优越的资源条件，不断提高纸的质量与产量。橡胶工业中除个别厂因遭国民党严重破坏尚在恢复外，其余已全部开工生产。今年内计划产汽车内外胎一万余套，人力车内外胎十五万三千套，转动皮带（工厂矿山用）六亿六千余万“布来”（计算皮带的单位，即一点五糎厚、一英寸宽、一英尺长），胶鞋四百四十七万五千双，各种胶管、防毒面具、雨衣等数万件。以现在各厂的生产效能估计，今年完成上述计划足有保证。如沈阳橡胶四厂三月份即超过生产计划百分之三十，第六厂则超过百分之四十四。其他各厂亦大多完成并超过计划。水泥公司所属各厂，已有三厂恢复生产，产品主要供给铁路交通及其他建筑之用。陶磁公司共有十二个工厂，现亦大部恢复生产，所产磁器和耐火砖，主要供给电气（绝缘器）及冶炼工业之用。规模宏大的沈阳玻璃工厂现正集中力量进行修复，发电炉及配电系统工程已大致完成，本年八月即可开始生产。预计明年该厂可能达到伪满时期最高年产量四十八万箱（每箱一百平方尺）的水平。上述各厂目前尚普遍存在着浪费现象，以致产品成本较高，故今年各厂除加紧恢复工作外，中心任务为减低成本与提高质量。
