    Worker-Soldier Comrades Meet on the Front Lines
    Reports of Taiyuan Workers Welcoming the People's Liberation Army

    When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army broke through the solid defenses of the Yan bandit's Taiyuan war zone and entered the woolen mill, the workers, disregarding the threat of enemy artillery fire, ran out to welcome their own army, boiling water for the PLA, guiding them, and carrying stretchers. They said in unison, "We've been waiting for you until our eyes have dried out! You've finally come!" They showed us a handful of noodles: "We live on this!" When an old worker mentioned that his son had been seized by the Yan bandits to serve as a soldier, he immediately burst into tears, demanding that the People's Liberation Army avenge him and rescue his child. A company of the People's Liberation Army was holding its position in the south courtyard of the workers' dormitory. Directly in front was the enemy's bunker extending from the city and the large artillery tower in the northeast corner of the city, which together blocked every corner of the south courtyard. The workers and their families braved the artillery fire to deliver water and food to the soldiers. The soldiers stopped them, saying, "The enemy's artillery fire is blocking this road, don't come!" The workers said, "We're not afraid!" They carried the empty buckets back and brought the water buckets again. The soldiers, drinking the water, said, "Don't boil any more, the enemy will fire artillery, and there are so many of us, you can't boil that much water!" As the workers were leaving, the soldiers repeatedly told them not to come again. The next day, the soldiers were digging fortifications a hundred meters away from the enemy, preparing to attack the city. The enemy was constantly taking potshots at this area. Suddenly, the gunfire intensified. The soldiers looked up and saw two workers' family members holding small pots, exposed on the road under enemy fire, rushing over. This made the soldiers very anxious. The soldiers shouted, "Get down! Get down!" They jumped down in a panic, only saying, "Comrades, drink quickly!" The soldiers drank the water while advising them not to send any more, and told them to go back that way. But they were not afraid of anything, only saying, "We heard you were coming a long time ago. A worker who returned from Yuci told us that the workers there have been raised up, and the People's Liberation Army treats the workers so well! We've been waiting for today, waiting for tomorrow, and you've finally come. We're no longer afraid of them (referring to the Yan bandits)." When the artillery fire for the city attack began and the troops advanced into the city, a worker from the repair shop volunteered to lead the way. When a soldier was wounded, he picked up the wounded soldier's gun, loaded it with bullets, and ran to the front of the position, pointing out what was an agency and what was a company. When the first squad charged, he followed the first squad, and when the seventh squad charged, he followed the seventh squad. He excitedly said, "The time for revenge has come, I must kill a few of them." (Taiyuan Frontline Telegram)

    工人战士火线上会师
    太原工人欢迎解放军的报导
    当解放军某部突破阎匪太原战区坚固防线打进毛织厂时，工人们不顾敌人炮火威胁，跑出欢迎自己的军队，给解放军烧水、带路、抬担架，他们不约而同的说：“盼你们盼的眼都干了，可来啦！”他们拿出一把面子来让我们看：“我们就吃这个活着！”老工人提到儿子被阎匪抓走当兵，立刻掉下泪来，要求解放军给报仇出气，解放他的孩子。解放军某连在该厂工人宿舍南院固守阵地，正面就是敌人由城内伸出的地堡和城东北角的那个大炮楼，一起封锁着南院的每个角落，工人及其家属冒着炮火给战士们送水送饭。战士们制止说：“敌人炮火正封锁这条道，你们别来！”工人们说：“不怕！”把空桶抬回去又把水桶送上来。战士们喝着水说：“可别烧了，敌人会打炮的，我们人又这样多，你们那能烧这多水呀！”工人临走时，战士们再嘱咐他们千万可别来了。第二天战士们在接敌百米地方挖工事，准备攻城，敌人不时的就向这里打冷枪，一时枪声突然紧起来，战士们抬头一看，原来是两个工人家属捧着小罐罐暴露在敌人火力下的马路上，急急的走来，这一下可把战士们急坏了，战士们喊：“快下来呀！快下来呀！”她们慌的跳下来，只是说：“同志们快喝吧！”战士们一边喝着水一边劝说着，可不要再送了，并告诉她们回去时应从那边去。可是她们什么都不怕，只是说：“早听说你们来了，由榆次回来个工人，告诉我们，那地方的工人提高了，解放军待工人可好咧！我们盼了今天盼明天，可把你们盼来了，再不怕他们（指阎匪）。”当攻城的炮火开始部队向城里开进时，一位修械所工人自告奋勇领路，战士负伤了，他接起伤员的枪，推上子弹跑到阵地前头，指着那是什么机关、什么公司，一班冲的时候他跟一班，七班冲的时候他跟七班，他兴奋的说：“可到报仇的时候了，我非打死他几个不行。”（太原前线电）
