Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: Following the Fushun Coal Mine's Second Employee Representative Conference held at the beginning of last month to discuss the adjustment of labor organization and rectification of management institutions (see our agency's April 19th dispatch), this adjustment work was listed as the central task for April. After a month of adjustment and improvement, 3,000 unnecessary laborers have been saved, most of whom have been transferred from indirect production to direct production. When the mine's oil plant discussed how to complete the production and construction plan at the end of March, it was believed that it was necessary to increase the workforce by 400 people. However, after democratic discussions and repeated studies by the employee representative conference of the whole plant, not only were people not added, but 500 people were withdrawn from the plant's more than 2,000 workers. The method was not only to reduce unnecessary overlapping management institutions and withdraw some personnel to transfer to production, but mainly to organize dispersed labor to give play to collective action. For example, the plant's 11 directly affiliated branches all have machine repair departments, each with 10 to 40 people, with dispersed strength and little work during normal times. Now, in addition to retaining the necessary repair workers, 80 people have been withdrawn to build the third crude oil unit. More than 100 carpenters, bricklayers, handymen, etc., who do odd repair work in each branch, have formed an engineering team to carry out a certain project in a concentrated manner. When adjusting the labor organization, the plant first actively organized workers to carry out a certain task in a concentrated manner, rather than passively cutting employees and then arranging them. For example, the crude oil branch plans to produce 27,000 tons of crude oil this year. After discussion, the workers proposed that if the third unit could be quickly repaired, 40,000 tons of oil could be produced. Therefore, while adjusting the labor organization, they called on workers to participate in the glorious repair task mentioned above and strive to complete 40,000 tons of crude oil. When merging management institutions, the Laohutai Mine first merged offices and then adjusted cadres in a planned way, thus avoiding the illusion of layoffs among employees. When the mine adjusted a large number of personnel to go down the pit to directly participate in coal mining and other work, it organized a warm send-off, with a Yangko team and drums and gongs, just like sending off new soldiers to the front line.

    抚顺煤矿调整机构
    组织分散劳力发挥集体作用
    粗油生产量将提高一半
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】抚顺煤矿于上月初召开第二次职工代表会讨论调整劳动组织与整顿管理机构（见本社四月十九日电讯）后，即将这一调整工作列为四月份的中心工作。经一月来的调整和改进，已节省出三千个不必要的劳动力，其中大部已由间接生产转入直接生产。该矿制油厂于三月底讨论如何完成生产修建计划时，曾认为必须增加四百人，但经全厂职工代表会民主讨论反复研究后，不但没有增加人，相反地还从全厂二千余工人中抽出了五百人。其办法除缩减不必要的重叠的管理机构，抽出一部分人员转入生产外，主要地是把分散的劳动力组织起来发挥集体的作用。如该厂直辖的十一个分厂，都各有机器修理系，每系有十多人至三四十人不等，力量分散，平时工作不多。现在除留下必要的修理工外，已抽出八十人去修建粗油第三部。各分厂做零星修补工作的木匠、瓦匠、杂工等百余人，则组成工程队，突击修建某种工程。在调整劳动组织时，该厂首先是积极地组织工人去突击完成某种任务，而不是消极地把员工裁减下去再给以安插。如粗油分厂今年计划产粗油二万七千吨，工人们讨论后提出如能迅速修复第三部，则可产油四万吨。于是在调整劳动组织同时，即号召工人参加上述光荣的修复任务，为完成四万吨粗油而奋斗。老虎台矿在合并管理机构时，先行合并办公，再有计划的调整干部，这样避免了职员发生裁员的错觉。该矿调整大批人员下坑直接参加挖煤等工作时，曾组织热烈的欢送，秧歌队锣鼓喧天，象欢送新战士上前线一样。
