　　　Flower of Glory
　　The great Soviet soldiers liberated Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, North Korea, and other places in the war against Germany and Japan. After completing the annihilation of the fascist forces, they all withdrew to their own country. What was left behind were the cemeteries of the commanders and fighters who heroically sacrificed themselves in the liberation war. They are covered with flowers by the people of these countries every year, which is extremely glorious! The U.S. military also made sacrifices for the anti-fascist war, but the U.S. ruling class has evil intentions. It does not teach the U.S. military to return home and resume peaceful life, but instead leaves most of them abroad, making them sacrifices for its expansionist policy, vainly attempting to use them to pave the way for its enslavement of the world. The people's curses replace gratitude, and the blood of the fallen U.S. soldiers is shed in vain!

    光荣之花
    伟大的苏维埃战士们在对德对日的战争中解放了波兰、捷克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、北朝鲜等地，在完成了歼灭法西斯武力以后，全部地撤回了国内，遗留下来的则是解放战争中英勇牺牲的指战员的墓地，年年受到了各该国人民的鲜花覆盖，光荣极了！美军也曾为反法西斯战争付出了牺牲，但是美国统治阶级居心不善，不教美军回国，恢复和平生活，而是大部地留在外国，做了它的扩张政策的牺牲品，妄想利用来铺平其奴役世界的道路，人民的诅咒代替了谢意，阵亡美军的血白流了！
