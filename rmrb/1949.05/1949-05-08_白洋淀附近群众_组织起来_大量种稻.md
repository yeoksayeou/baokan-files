    Masses Near Baiyangdian
    Organize to Plant Rice on a Large Scale
    [Anxin News] The masses in large villages near Baiyangdian are now actively soaking rice seedlings, preparing seeds, building paddies, and transplanting rice seedlings, preparing to plant rice on a large scale. Tian Si, the head of Datianzhuang, and Zhu Rujian organized seven groups with their 29 families, together cultivating 6.7 mu of rice seedlings. They also motivated Tian Tiehu, a military dependent, to build 0.8 mu of rice seedling paddies. Tian Qinxin and three others implemented a division of labor, with two people hoeing the mud and two people building rice seedling paddies. Some families with little strength couldn't afford a boat or knew how to hoe mud, so they organized together to jointly hire a boat and hoe mud. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen villages including Dabai Dian, Quantou, Zhaobeikou, Dongdiantou, and Mabao, the masses have already soaked or are sprouting 21,466 jin of rice seeds. Generally, every 9 jin of seeds sprouts enough rice seedlings for 0.1 mu of rice seedling beds, totaling 238.5 mu. Each 0.1 mu of rice seedlings can plant anywhere from 2.5 mu, 3 mu, to 5 mu of rice paddies. Using 3 mu as the calculation, it would total 7,155 mu of rice fields. The masses are still actively building rice seedling paddies and looking for rice paddy land (some households without paddy fields have found land and privately agreed with the landlords on a split of the harvest, or will split it according to the 3-7 ratio in the future, a local custom).
