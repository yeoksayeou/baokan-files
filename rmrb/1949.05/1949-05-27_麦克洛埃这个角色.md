　　The Role of McCloy
    Before the U.S. peace treaty with Germany was negotiated and concluded, it illegally and unilaterally dispatched a "High Commissioner to Germany." This Commissioner McCloy, as revealed by the American Compass newspaper, was originally a henchman of the American monopoly capitalists Rockefeller and the owners of Mobil Oil. During the war against the Nazis, he continued to partner with the Nazi tycoons in business. Although American soldiers shed blood and sacrificed their lives on the European battlefield, these henchmen secretly engaged in shameless and dirty business on the land soaked in blood and sweat! The self-proclaimed "American way of life" is further explained by this matter: the formulation and implementation of American foreign policy is for the profits of monopoly capitalists.

　　麦克洛埃这个角色
    美帝在对德和约未谈判订立以前即违法地片面行动派遣了一个“驻德高级专员”，这位麦克洛埃专员，经美国指南针日报揭发，原是美国大垄断资本家洛克菲勒与美孚油公司的老板们的伙计，在和纳粹作战时期仍然和纳粹的大财阀合伙做生意，虽然美国兵士在欧洲战场上也流了血，牺牲了生命，而这些伙计们却在血汗漂流的土地上秘密地进行着无耻的龌龊生意！自吹自捧的所谓“美国生活方式”，从这件事情上又得到了一个说明：美国外交政策的拟定与执行，是为了垄断资本家的利润。
