Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 24th—The vanguard unit of the People's Liberation Army, advancing towards Shanghai along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, fiercely pursued the fleeing enemy and rescued bridges in various locations. On the 12th, with the help of boatmen along the way, the unit quickly erected five pontoon bridges, each over half a kilometer long, between Jiaxing and Songjiang. On the dawn of the 13th, they advanced directly to the Dadongbin Railway Bridge, thirteen miles west of Songjiang city. At that time, the fleeing bandit troops had already placed explosives on the bridge and were preparing to detonate them. The 8th Company of the unit immediately charged towards the bridge with two platoons, braving the enemy's dense fire, and captured the enemy's position at the south end of the railway bridge in one fell swoop. Then, another platoon continued the attack and crossed the over one hundred meter long railway bridge in four minutes, occupying the bridgehead bunker on the north end, and finally preserving this large railway bridge. The leaders of a certain corps issued a special order to commend the company.

  　挺进上海先遣部队
    荣获兵团首长嘉奖
    【新华社上海前线二十四日电】沿沪杭铁路向上海挺进的解放军先遣部队，猛追逃敌，抢救各地桥梁。十二日，该部在沿途船工帮助下，在嘉兴、松江之间迅速架起了五座各长一里多的浮桥，于十三日拂晓直薄松江城西十三里处的大东滨铁桥。当时北逃匪军已在该桥安好炸药准备拉火。该部第八连立即以两个班，冒着敌人的密集火力向桥上冲去，一举攻占铁桥南头的敌阵。随即又以一个班继续攻击，于四分钟内冲过了长达一百多米的铁桥，占领了北头的桥头堡垒，终于保全了这一大铁桥。某兵团首长对该连特通令嘉奖。
