Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th -- Reports from various sources: The preliminary conference on the Indonesian question, which began on April 14th in Batavia under the auspices of the reactionary American representative Cochran, has reached a so-called "verbal agreement" on the 7th of this month. At Cochran's suggestion, the agreement is named the "Roijen-Rum Statement," Roijen being the chief Dutch representative and Rum the chief representative of Hatta. This agreement is part of the overall plan of American imperialism to oppose the people of Southeast Asia. It exposes the collusion of Hatta and Sukarno with American imperialism, their betrayal of the interests of the Indonesian nation, and their attempt to compromise with the Dutch colonial authorities to jointly suppress the Indonesian people's liberation movement. According to the agreement, the Indonesian reactionary leaders Hatta and Sukarno made the following "personal guarantees" to Dutch imperialism: (1) As soon as they return to Yogyakarta, they will first issue a ceasefire order to the Republic's guerrillas; (2) They will cooperate with the Dutch army to establish so-called peace and security.

They will urge the Indonesian reactionary groups to participate in the Hague Round Table Conference proposed by the Netherlands to formally study a plan to "resolve the Indonesian question." On the other hand, the Netherlands guarantees to allow Hatta and others to return to Yogyakarta and restore Hatta's regime, but its jurisdiction will be limited to the Yogyakarta Special Region (boundaries not yet defined). In order to implement the above agreement, the two delegations will discuss on the 15th the establishment of two joint committees to prepare for Hatta's return to Yogyakarta to take power and to study specific ways to divide the Indonesian guerrillas and cooperate with the Netherlands to maintain order. This verbal agreement between Hatta and the Netherlands obviously aims to attack the Indonesian people, but the conflict of interests between the Netherlands and the Indonesian reactionaries has not been completely resolved.

    在美反动派主持下
    哈达出卖印尼利益
    与荷帝获“口头协议”
    【新华社北平十日电】各方报道：在美国反动派代表柯契伦主持之下于四月十四日在巴达维亚开始举行的印尼问题预备会议，已于本月七日取得所谓“口头协议”。依照柯契伦的建议，协议定名为“罗延与鲁姆的声明”，罗延为荷兰首席代表，鲁姆为哈达的首席代表。这个协议是美帝国主义反对东南亚人民的总计划的一部分。它暴露了哈达、苏加诺辈与美国帝国主义勾结，出卖印尼民族利益，图谋与荷兰殖民当局妥协，共同镇压印尼人民解放运动的阴谋。根据该协议，印尼反动首领哈达与苏加诺两人，向荷兰帝国主义作如下“个人保证”。（１）一俟他们回到日惹，他们将首先向游击队的共和军发布停战令；（２）他们将与荷军合作以建立所谓和平与治安。
    他们将促使印尼的反动集团参加荷兰所建议的海牙圆桌会议，正式研究“解决印尼问题”的方案。另一方面？荷兰方面保证使哈达等返回日惹，恢复哈达的政权，但其所辖范围只限于日惹特区（界线未订）。为实行上述协议，双方代表团于十五日商讨成立两个联合委员会，以准备哈达重返日惹执政并研究分化印尼游击队以及与荷兰合作维持秩序的具体办法。哈达和荷兰的这个口头协议，显然以进攻印尼人，为共同目标，但荷兰与印尼反动派间的利益争执则尚未完全解决。
