[Tianjin Dispatch] To improve their work, various departments and offices under the Tianjin People's Bank, as well as seventeen units including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, began a general inspection of certain bureaucratic styles in their operations on April 5th. The units studied and discussed documents such as "What is Bureaucracy?" (excerpted from "Liberation Daily"). After the inspection, there have been preliminary improvements in operations.

(1) Deposit and withdrawal procedures have been simplified: For example, at the Bank of China, before the inspection, whether depositing or withdrawing money, it was necessary to go through five stamps (and sometimes even the deputy manager) from the bill maker, reviewer, section chief, department chief, and business office director. If the transfer sheet could not be delivered quickly, it would take a long time. Now the procedure has been generally simplified to three times, with the business office director and deputy manager only adding their stamps after the customer has left the counter or only stamping the cover, saving the customer half the time.

(2) In the past, at the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, each time a customer applied for a loan, there were many back-and-forth procedures from application, investigation, contract signing to collateral and withdrawal. One factory spent half a month and ran no less than seven or eight times to get a loan from the Bank of Communications. By the time the procedures were completed, it happened to coincide with the suspension of loans, resulting in wasted effort. Now, the Bank of China generally conducts business understanding of various import and export merchants at ordinary times, so there is no need for temporary investigation when lending. When the business personnel of the Bank of Communications go to the loan households for investigation, they conveniently send the application form and investigation form. If it has been approved, they will first notify them by phone to withdraw the money. When the loan households withdraw the money, they simply bring their own seals and guarantor seals, and only need to contact twice to complete the process.

(3) The efficiency of the Cashier Department has been improved: Before the inspection, several units had a few people who did not participate in the actual counting of votes. They just recorded the accounts and handed them over to the vault after others counted them, and mechanically executed office hours. At four o'clock, or even sometimes before four o'clock, they would not accept the money. After review, not only has the efficiency of counting tickets increased, but it has also provided convenience to customers in terms of time. Since the Bank of China implemented the sealing system, the daily amount received has increased from 5-6 million to 30-40 million.

(4) Attitudes towards customers have improved. Before the inspection, some customers reflected that employees were cold and impatient towards customers. For example, the Bank of Communications has a large vault and a small vault. More than 100,000 yuan is paid to the large vault, and less than 100,000 yuan is paid to the small vault, but it is often not explained clearly to the payer, causing them to wander between the large and small vaults, unable to deliver quickly. After inspection, this phenomenon disappeared. Branch business departments, cooperative departments, and other units have set up inquiry offices. In general, employees have initially established the concept of serving the people in their thinking, so their attitude towards customers should be improved.

(5) Internal communication is becoming closer: According to statistics from the Cooperative Department and the Savings Department, it used to take 15 to 20 minutes to open a transfer slip, but now it generally takes less than 10 minutes, and the fastest only takes 3 minutes.

However, due to insufficient prior preparation, many original employees did not understand the meaning of bureaucratic style in their thinking, and there are still concerns, daring not to speak their minds, fearing that it would affect their future careers. Therefore, there is still a lack of deep exposure to the specific manifestations of bureaucracy.

### 津人民银行各单位检查业务  简化存放取款手续  对顾客态度亦有转变

    津人民银行各单位检查业务
    简化存放取款手续
    对顾客态度亦有转变
    【天津电】津市人民银行所属各部、处及中国、交通两行等十七个单位，为改进工作，于四月五日开始普遍检查业务上的某些官僚主义作风。曾使各单位分别学习与讨论“什么叫官僚主义”（摘自“解放日报”）等文件。经过检查，业务已有初步改进。
    （一）简化了存款和取款手续：譬如中国银行，在检查以前，无论存款或取款。必须经过制票人、复核、股长、科长及营业室主任等五次盖章（有时候还需要经过副经理）；如果传票生不能迅速传递时，即拖延很长时间。现在手续，一般的已简化为三次，营业室主任及副经理只待顾客离柜后补盖或只盖封面章，这样就使顾客节省了一半的时间。
    （二）过去在中国、交通两行每贷一次款，顾客由申请、调查、订合同到对保取款，往返手续甚多。某工厂为向交通银行贷款，曾花费了半个月的工夫，跑了不下七八趟。当手续办妥时，恰巧又赶上了停止贷款，结果白费了力气。现在中国银行在平时已普遍对各进出口商行进行业务上的了解，所以贷款时，就不再需要临时去调查。交通银行的业务员在赴各贷款户作调查时，就顺便把申请书、调查表送上了，如已核准，就先以电话通知去取款，贷款户取款时，即顺便带着自己的图章、保章，只需要接洽两次，就可办妥。
    （三）出纳科效率提高：在未检查前，好几个单位都存在着少数人不参加实际的点票工作，只要别人点了以后，记记帐交到库房，而且机械的执行办公时间。一到四点钟，甚至有时候不到四点钟，即不顾收款了。经过检讨之后，不只点票的效率提高，在时间上也给顾客以方便，中国银行自实行签封制以后，每日所收数额由五六百万提高到三四千万元。
    （四）对顾客的态度已有改善。在未检查前，有些顾客反映，职员对顾客态度冷淡、不耐心。如交通银行有大库和小库，收款时十万以上的交大库，十万以下的交小库，但往往不向交款员说清楚，使他们徘徊于大小库之间，不能迅速交付。经检查之后，这种现象没有了。分行营业部，合作部等单位，都曾设了询问处。一般职员在思想上已初步建立了为人民服务的观点，因此对顾客的态度要有改善。
    （五）内部联系日趋密切：据合作部及储蓄部的统计，过去开一张传票，需要十五分到二十分钟，现在一般的不足十分钟，最快的只要三分钟就行了。
    但是由于事前酝酿不足，很多原有的职员在思想上不了解官僚主义作风的涵义，尚存在着顾虑，不敢说出心里话，怕对今后的职业发生影响，因此对官僚主义的具体表现还缺乏深刻的揭发。
