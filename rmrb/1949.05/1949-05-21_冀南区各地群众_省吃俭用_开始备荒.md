　　Jinnan District Masses
  　Save on Food and Expenses, Begin Famine Preparations
    [Jinnan Electric Dispatch] "If it doesn't rain, plan early; small streams flow steadily to prepare for famine years." Various areas of the Jinnan District have begun saving and preparing for famine. The Party branch and village cadres of Dongsong Village in the Third District of Yuanchao, recalling the suffering of the famine in 1932 of the Republic of China, deeply recognized the importance of saving and preparing for famine. Branch committee member Ai Jueyi made his own savings plan at the general meeting: starting today, his daughter-in-law will go to the fields to gather wild vegetables and mix them with food; the four hundred catties of dried radish saved will be used entirely as food; they will eat less oil, use less light, not smoke cigarettes, and feed the piglets more wild vegetables and less grain. In this way, the whole family can save ten dou of grain before wheat harvest. Then all the Party members made savings plans and decided to universally call on the masses to practice strict economy. After the mass meeting, woman Wang Hailian and her husband returned home to calculate the accounts specifically. A family of three guaranteed to save five dou of grain before wheat harvest. Duan Zhijie, the Party branch secretary of Duan Lüpo Village in the First District of Qinghe, convened a branch meeting to study how to prepare for famine and decided to mobilize the masses to mix bran and vegetables with their food, saving on food and expenses. Now the masses in the village have raised their vigilance. Song Jinhe's family, a military dependent family in Dazhuzhuang Village, Third District, has four family members and still has more than four hundred catties of grain, but seeing that it has not rained yet, he held a family meeting to discuss saving and planned to eat vegetable rice every morning and grind ten catties of grain to mix with one catty of bran. The District Committee of the Eighth District of Zaoqiang called on cadres to go deep into the villages to mobilize the masses to save. Now, in addition to stepping up the planting and replanting, the masses in the villages have begun to mix bran and vegetables with their food. In addition, the economy and famine preparation movement in Nangong and other counties is also gradually being promoted.

　　冀南区各地群众
  　省吃俭用  开始备荒
    【冀南电】“天旱不雨早打算，细水长流备荒年”冀南区各地开始节约备荒。元朝三区东宋村支部、村干部回想起民国三十二年的灾荒痛苦后，深刻认识了节约备荒的重要。支委艾觉议在大会上做出自己的节约计划：从今天起媳妇将下地采野菜，搀菜吃，存下的四百斤萝卜干，全顶粮食吃；以后少吃油、少点灯、不吸纸烟，小猪多喂野菜，少喂粮食。这样全家在麦前可省十市斗粮食。接着各党员都订出节约计划，并决定普遍号召群众厉行节约。开群众大会后，妇女王海连和她丈夫回家具体算帐，一家三口人，在麦前保证节约五市斗粮食。清河一区段吕坡村支部书记段之杰，召开支部会研究如何备荒，决定分片动员群众搀糠、搀菜、省吃俭用。现该村群众都已提起警惕。三区大辛庄军属宋金合家，四口人现在还有四百多斤粮食，可是他看到至今不下雨，就开了个家庭会，讨论节约，计划每天早晨吃菜饭，磨十斤粮食搀一斤糠。枣强八区区委会号召各干部深入各村，动员群众节约。现各村群众除加紧抢种点种外，并已开始搀糠吃菜。此外南宫等县节约备荒运动也正逐渐推广中。
