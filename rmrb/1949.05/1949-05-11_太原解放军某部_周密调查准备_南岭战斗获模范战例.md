    A Certain Unit of the PLA in Taiyuan
    Thoroughly Investigates and Prepares;
    Nanling Battle Wins Model Example
    [Taiyuan Electric] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, due to the implementation of the corps' carefully planned and thoroughly prepared policy, achieved a victory with large gains and small casualties in the battle to seize Songzhuang Nanling, setting a model example. Before entering the battle, this unit conducted continuous political mobilization and investigative preparation work from top to bottom. After the general attack began, within half an hour, our army broke through the enemy Yan's forward positions, which had been painstakingly built for half a year, and quickly seized three deeply deployed contact positions on Nanling, completely annihilating more than two battalions of the Second Regiment of Yan's Forty-Ninth Division. Many soldiers believed that this battle was even smoother than their usual exercises.
    During the defense of the position, the unit constantly reconnoitered and understood the enemy situation and terrain, set up a sand table based on the enemy's fortifications, firepower positions, and troop deployments, and repeatedly studied it. As soon as enemy soldiers surrendered from the position, our cadres and soldiers took the initiative to find them to investigate and inquire about the situation, correcting the position of each firing point on the sand table, and the cadres personally went to feel out the enemy's fortifications. Cadres of the Fourth Company reconnoitered three times, and squads and below reconnoitered six times. Regardless of cadres or soldiers, they were very familiar with the enemy situation and terrain. When the combat mission was determined, each combat unit responsible for the assault automatically studied assault methods, proposed combat means and necessary technical preparations, and repeatedly carried out practical combat exercises.
    A certain unit that was assigned the task of inserting behind enemy lines also frequently bypassed Nanling to conduct reconnaissance deep into the enemy's lines. When the soldiers saw that the gap for inserting into the enemy's formation was very small on the sand table, they had concerns. The cadres then led the soldiers to personally conduct reconnaissance. Cadres of the Seventh Company reconnoitered as far as the enemy's toilet and kitchen, personally reconnoitering for a long time. The thorough reconnaissance and understanding of the enemy situation and terrain was an important key to the victory in this battle.

    太原解放军某部
    周密调查准备
    南岭战斗获模范战例
    【太原电】解放军某部，由于执行了兵团精心计划、周密准备的方针，在夺取松庄南岭战斗中获得胜利大、伤亡小的模范战例。该部在进入战斗前，从上到下曾经进行过连续的政治动员、调查准备工作。总攻开始后，半小时内，我军即突破阎匪苦心修筑达半年之久的前沿阵地，迅速夺取了南岭上三个纵深配备的触战阵地，全歼阎匪四九师二团两个多营的兵力，许多战士认为这次打仗，比大家平时演习动作还要顺当。
    该部在坚守阵地中，即对敌情地形不断的进行了侦察了解，根据敌人工事、火力方位、兵力布置，摆成沙盘，反复研究。敌军士兵一从阵地上投诚过来，我们的干部战士们就主动找他们调查询问情况，在沙盘上修正每一个火点方位，干部并亲自去摸敌人工事。该部四连连排干部摸了三次，班以下摸了六次，不论干部、战士对敌情地形都非常熟悉。当战斗任务确定后，每个担负突击的战斗单位，都自动研究突击方法，提出战斗手段和应有的技术准备，并反复的进行了实战演习。
    担任敌后插入任务的某部，也经常绕过南岭摸到敌人纵深进行侦察。战士们在沙盘上看到插入敌阵的空隙很小，曾发生过顾虑，干部就带上战士亲自去侦察，七连干部曾摸到敌人厕所伙房去，亲自侦察很久，对于敌情地形的周密侦察了解是这次战斗取得胜利的重要关键。
