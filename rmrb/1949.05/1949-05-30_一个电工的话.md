	One morning, I was opening the People's Daily, reading the victorious news of capturing 80,000 bandit troops in the Jiangnan area. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and Comrade He from the office brought in a young man in a blue worker's uniform. After Comrade He finished speaking, he went out, and this young man took out pliers and a screwdriver (for screwing in screws) from his bag, and started knocking on the wall with a "ding ding dong dong" sound. I didn't want to pay attention to him removing the electric bell and turned back to continue reading the victory news.

	He took a look at the call machine (i.e., the electric bell) after he had removed it, as if he had discovered an incredible secret. He squeezed his eyebrows sarcastically, waved at me with the pliers in his hand, and repeatedly shouted, "Come and see, comrade! Look at what this is!"

	I was startled and also curious, so I immediately ran over.

	"Comrade, look, this thing is so interesting!" He fiddled with the ten or so small cylinders inside the call machine – pressing it makes it pop up, pressing it again makes it suddenly spring down – as if pointing at the tip of an enemy's nose. With a mocking attitude, he angrily rebuked in a low voice: "Tsk! You are the Third Madam, you are the Second Miss... Just look at you money-grubbing demons from the past, how many servants you must have used!"

	I took a closer look and realized that almost all of these small cylinders had a round red piece of paper pasted on them, with black characters written on them such as: Front Parlor, East Parlor, Second Madam, East Room, Third Madam, Second Miss, Main Gate, Old Madam, etc. Oh! This country bumpkin of mine finally understood: If the Third Madam pressed the switch, the electric bell in this room would ring, and at the same time, the "Third Madam" on the small cylinder would pop into the round hole. The servants saw it through the glass, of course, they would run to the Third Madam's room to be at her beck and call and endure torture. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but feel indignant. But then the worker said again:

	"This house used to belong to either a military commander or a bureaucratic capitalist. Look, comrade!"

	Before I could speak, he pointed to the two small cylinders whose red paper was already damaged and speculatively said with a hint of pride: "If there is a Second Madam and a Third Madam, there must be a First Madam; if there is a Second Miss, there must be a First Miss. These two without words must be them!"

	I felt that his judgment made some sense. So I asked, "Now that Peiping is liberated, what do you think they're all doing?"

	"What can these parasites do! They can't do labor, and they can't produce!"

	I said again: "In the new society, they should also be transformed!"

	"Of course!" He explained to me very solemnly: "The People's Government is for the people, they should be allowed to participate in labor!"

	During this conversation, I unknowingly began to admire this friend I had just met. After he finished dismantling the electric bell, I poured him a cup of boiled water and asked him to sit down and rest. During the subsequent chat, I learned that his name was Liu Xianhua, an electrician from an electrical appliance shop. Before liberation, he worked as an electrician at Peking University, and after liberation, he came to work at North China University. He had participated in strikes, participated in parades and demonstrations, and fought those Chiang Kai-shek bandits with great satisfaction. On the day the People's Liberation Army entered the city, he and his brothers from the trade union ran all the way to Xidan to welcome them. He squeezed to the front of the crowd, watching the countless cannons, tanks, and armored vehicles, followed by all red horses, all white horses, all dappled horses... passing through the sea of people. He was so happy that he couldn't speak, and tears welled up in his eyes. We talked about wages, and he said:

	"Before, I had a base salary of twenty-five yuan, but now it's more than one hundred and twenty catties of millet. Calculating it, it's not much different."

	I asked again: "Since it's not much different, was it better before or is it better now?"

	"Of course, it's better now!" He answered me with full certainty and excitement: "Think about it, before, the police and soldiers, everyone bullied us workers, and we couldn't even think about dancing the Yangko or beating gongs and drums in the streets to have fun. Now, not only can we freely join the trade union, but the government is also ours, and we can raise any opinions. Wouldn't you say it's good?"

	I deliberately asked: "This is just saying that there is freedom and equality, but what about wages--?"

	"Comrade, you can't look at it that way." He was very anxious, and before I could finish speaking, he answered without thinking: "Peiping has only just been liberated, of course, there are still many difficulties. Soon the whole country will be victorious, our proletariat will be in the lead, greatly develop production, and we won't have to worry about wages not increasing!"

	I patted him on the shoulders twice enthusiastically to express my infinite respect for him. But he had already stood up and turned to me and said, "Comrade, we can't chat too much. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must step up production to support the front lines, we can't be lazy!"

	He held the electric bell and a ball of colored wire in one hand, and the pliers and other tools in the other hand. As he spoke, he walked, pushed open the door and ran out.

	After this electrician left, his words echoed in my ears for a long time. These words will continue to educate me and will never be erased.

　　一个电工的话
    古今
    一天上午，我正打开人民日报，读江南活捉匪军八万的胜利消息。忽地，门吱的一声被拉开，办公室的何同志，带了个着青色工人制服的青年进来。何同志说完话就出去了，这青年便从挂包里掏出了钳子和盖锥（下螺丝钉用），在壁头上叮叮咚咚的敲打；我不想注意他卸电铃，仍回过头来继续读胜利消息。
    他把唤人机（即电铃）卸开一瞧，就象发见了一个了不得的秘密，讽刺地挤着眉眼，用手里的钳子不住的招着我，且连声叫道：“来看，同志！你瞧这是什么？”
    我吃了一惊，又有些好奇，自然立刻跑过去了。
    “同志，你看，这玩意多有意思！”他拨弄着唤人机里十来个小圆柱--一按使得它翅上去，一按又忽然弹下来--就象是指着一个仇人的鼻子尖，他用嘲笑的态度，气愤愤的低声责骂：“咳！你是三太太，你是二小姐，……看你们从前那些有钱的妖精，得使他妈的多少佣人哟！”
    我仔细一看，原来那些小圆柱上，差不多都贴了一块圆溜溜的红纸片，上面写着前客厅、东客厅，二太太、东房、三太太、二小姐、大门、老太太等黑字儿。哦！我这土豹子这才明白：三太太如按开关，这屋里的电铃准响，同时小圆柱上的“三太太”就得弹到圆眼里来；佣人们通过玻璃望见了，当然是撒腿就往三太太房里跑，去听其驱使，去忍受折磨。这样一想，心里不由得要愤激。可是那工人又说了：
    “从前这座房，不是军长师长的，就得是官僚资本家的。你看，同志！”
    我还没有出声，他又指着那两个已经损毁了红纸块的小圆柱，怪得意的推测：“有二太太、三太太，一定还得有大太太；有二小姐，怕也少不了个大小姐。这两个没字的，准定就是她们俩！”
    我觉得他判断得有些道理。于是又问：“如今北平解放了，你说她们都干什么去了呀？”
    “这些寄生虫能干什么！不能劳动，生产又不成！”
    我又说：“在新社会里，也该叫他们转变呀！”
    “那当然！”他很郑重的跟我解释：“人民政府给人民作主，应当让她们去参加劳动！”
    在这段谈话中，我对这个初次见面的朋友，不知不觉的敬仰起来。当他卸罢了电铃，我就倒了一杯开水，请他坐下来歇歇。在继续闲扯当中，知道了他叫刘宪华，电汽行的电工出身，解放以前在北大当电工，解放后才到华北大学来工作的。他曾经参加过罢工，参加过游行示威，和那些蒋匪强盗，可斗争了个痛快。解放军入城那天，他和工会的弟兄们，一直跑到西单去欢迎；自己挤在人群的最前面，看那数不清的大炮、坦克和装甲车，接着是一色的红马，一色的白马，一色的花马，……在人山人海中通过。他实在是乐得话也说不出，泪都涌出来了。我们谈到工资，他说：
    “从前我是二十五块底薪，现在是一百二十多斤小米，算起来，也差不了多少。”
    我又问：“既然差不多少，那是从前好呢，还是现在好？”
    “当然是现在好罗！”他满肯定的，十分兴奋的回答我：“你想从前，警察大兵，谁也欺负咱工人，根本就别想在大街上扭秧歌，打锣打鼓的欢乐了。如今别说能自由参加工会，政府也是咱人民的，有什么意见都能提，你说还不好呀！”
    我有意的反问：“这只是说有了自由平等，工资--”
    “同志，你可不能这样看。”他很急，没待我说完，连想都没有多想就回答了：“北平才解放，当然还有许多困难。不久全国胜利了，咱们无产阶级作领导，大大的发展生产，还怕工资不能提高！”
    我热情的拍两下他的肩膀，表示对他无限的尊敬；可是他已经站起来，转身对我说：“同志，可不能多扯啦。受毛主席的领导，就得加紧生产，支援前线，可是不能偷懒啊！”
    他一手抱着电铃和挽在手上的一团花线，一手拿着钳子之类的家具，说着走着，推开门就跑出去了。
    这电工走后，他的话却长时间在我耳朵里鸣响；这些话将要不断的教育着我，永远也不会磨灭的了。
