　　The Joy of Creation
　　Lu Shen

　　In the iron workshop, I saw old worker Liang Changrui about to heat a three-foot-long, inch-and-a-half square iron bar. After heating it, he said to me:
　　"This is called 'wind iron,' left over from the Japanese devils. It's incredibly hard! The Kuomintang wanted to use it, but they couldn't forge it. After liberation, we tried once, but it still didn't work!..."

　　At this point, Lü Qiuzhang, who swings the sledgehammer, interjected:
　　"Last autumn, we wanted to use it to forge the rotary knives for the railcars. Everyone said the Kuomintang had tried before and failed. I said: 'We can't compare the work we do now with what they did then. Let's try again!' But it turned out to be too hard. We hit it, and a layer of skin peeled off; we hit it again, and another layer peeled off, but it wouldn't budge. And the vibration was so strong that my hand was bruised! Look." He held out his hand, pointing to the palm.
　　Although the bleeding had stopped, the lines on his palm still showed cracks.

　　Liang Changrui added: "We couldn't forge it. We heard there were steam hammers at the Jingxing Mine, so we sent it there. But after a few days, they sent it back, saying it was too much trouble!"

　　"Then why are you working on it now?" I asked, puzzled.

　　Liang Changrui pointed excitedly to the side: "We've got a better tool!"

　　I saw a frame made of six iron rails and several angle irons, with a main shaft and two pulleys on top. A four-inch-wide belt on the left pulley was connected to an electric motor, and a wider belt on the right pulley led to two hand-pull rings at one end and a seventy- or eighty-kilogram iron hammer at the other!

　　"This thing can handle it!" Liang Changrui said, pointing to the large hammer. "This is the invention of Section Chief Dou from the engineering section!"

　　Just then, Section Chief Dou arrived. "This isn't an invention at all; it's just a cobbled-together contraption!"

　　His sudden remark made us all laugh.

　　Section Chief Dou, who came from a working-class background, had been an apprentice since he was a teenager and had never left the factory. He pointed to the iron frame and said to me:
　　"The broken rails were picked from the scrap iron piles left by the Kuomintang. The pulleys were bought as scrap from the trading company. The frame was slowly built up in our spare time. Only the hammer is new."

　　Liang Changrui saw that the wind steel in the furnace was glowing neither red nor white, but like the moon. "It's ready!" he shouted excitedly. Section Chief Dou turned on the power, and the electric motor quickly spun the pulleys. Lü Qiuzhang and Lü Shitou, two strong young men who swing the sledgehammer, pulled up the large iron hammer. Liang Changrui put the wind steel on the anvil and started hitting it, hammer after hammer! In Lü Qiuzhang's words, "Human power becomes electric power, and electric power becomes human power." After each pass, the inch-and-a-half square wind steel was reduced by half an inch on each side!

　　Everyone worked happily and enthusiastically!

　　After more than two hours, only a small piece of the three-foot-long wind steel remained. What happened to the rest? It was transformed into rotary knives for the railcars!

　　Liang Changrui added:
　　"The Kuomintang couldn't forge it because no one thought of a solution. Those receiving officials' 'developing production' meant lining their own pockets. Only we are trying our best to develop production!"

　　"That's the truth!" everyone said in unison.

　　Liang Changrui continued:
　　"Whether it counts as an invention or not, we've added equipment that we didn't have before, and we've accomplished work that we couldn't do before!"

　　Several people looked at the belt hammer, looked at the newly forged rotary knives, and smiled with joy!

　　创造的喜悦
    路深
    到铁工房，见老工人梁长瑞正要烧一根三尺多长寸半见方的铁棍。烧上后，他对我说：
    “这叫风铁，还是日本鬼子留下来的，可硬着哩！国民党在时想用它，打打，打不动。解放后，咱试过一回，还是不行！……”
    到这里，抡大锤的吕秋长，插了嘴：
    “在去年秋后，咱们想用它，打元车上的旋刀，都说以前国民党在时打过，打不动；我说：那时做活不能和现在相比，咱再试试看！一试，谁知这家伙就是硬，打打，脱一层皮，打打，脱一层皮，就是一点也不往下下。这家伙震力又大，打了一会子，把我的手都震破了！你看。”他伸出手来，指着手掌心给我看。
    现在虽然出血的地方复原了，掌心纹处还留着裂口的痕迹。
    梁长瑞又补充说：“咱打不了，听说井陉矿上有汽锤，送去给人家打，几天，人家又给原封送回来了，嫌费劲！”
    “那怎么现在又摆弄它呢！”我疑惑地问。
    梁长瑞兴奋地向旁边一指：“有了得劲儿的家伙了！”
    我一看，就是—六根铁轨和几条三角铁搭成的一个架子，上面一根天轴带两个皮带轮，左边轮上一圈四寸宽的皮带连到电滚子上，右边轮上一根较宽的皮带，一头是两个手拉环，一头是一个七、八十公斤的大铁锤！
    “这家伙就能降住它！”梁长瑞指着大铁锤说：“这是工程科窦科长的发明创造！”
    说着，恰好窦科长也来到了，“这不能算什么发明创造，这叫瞎凑合！”
    他的突然搭话惹得我们都笑起来。
    窦科长，是工人出身，从十几岁上就当学徒，直到现在没离开过一天工厂，他指着铁架对我说：
    “破铁轨是从国民党留下的废铁堆里拣出来的，皮带轮是从贸易商行当废铁买来的，架子是利用零工夫慢慢搭起来的，就这锤是新做的。”
    梁长瑞看到炉里的风钢显出似红不红，似白不白，象月亮一样的颜色了，“好了！”他兴奋的一喊，窦科长开了电闸，电滚子带着皮带轮飞快地转动起来，吕秋长和吕石头两个抡大锤的壮小伙子，把大铁锤拉起来；梁长瑞拿风钢放到砧子上，一锤一锤地打起来！用吕秋长的话说吧，“人力就电力，电力就人力”，一遍打下来，寸半见方的风钢每一面就下半分！
    大家兴奋愉快地劳动着！
    两点多钟过去，三尺多长的风钢只剩下一小截了，那些呢？变成了元车上的旋刀！
    梁长瑞又说了：
    “国民党在时，打不了，没人想法子，他们那些接收大员的‘发展生产’。是往自己口袋发的，只有咱们才是想尽各种办法发展生产哩！”
    “这可是老实话！”大伙都异口同声地说。
    梁长瑞接着说：
    “不管算创造发明不算，反正过去没有的家俱咱们添上了，过去不能做的活儿咱们做成了！”
    几个人看着皮带锤，看着新打成的元车旋刀，喜悦地笑了！
