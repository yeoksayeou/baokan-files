Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20th: According to the US News Agency, Washington: Truman appointed McCloy, the president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the United Nations, as the first US "High Commissioner for Germany" on the 18th. The appointment has been sent to the US Senate for approval. Note: The establishment of the so-called "High Commissioner for Germany" post is based on the unilateral agreement reached by the US, British, and French foreign ministers in Washington in early April. According to the agreement, after the so-called "Occupation Statute" is implemented, "each agency of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany will be under the command of a High Commissioner, and the three countries' High Commissioners will organize the Allied High Commission, i.e., the Allied Supreme Control Authority."
