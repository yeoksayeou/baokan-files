    To Coordinate with the Nation's Large-Scale Industrial and Mining Construction
    Northeast China Actively Develops Electricity
    Annual Power Transmission to be Doubled from Last Year
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th) After a long period of arduous restoration and construction, state-owned electric power in Northeast China has nearly doubled the region's electricity compared to a year ago. The transformer capacity has increased by 100,000 kVA (kilovolt-amperes), and extra-high-voltage transmission lines have increased by 1,500 kilometers. Among these, the power supply from thermal power generation has increased by one and a half times compared to before 1947, with 78% being used for industrial and mining construction. The electric power industry in Northeast China originally had a good foundation. Before the "August 15th" (end of WWII), the South Manchuria, Central Manchuria, and East Manchuria power grids each had a combination of hydroelectric and thermal power generation, with ultra-high-voltage lines transmitting power to each other, totaling more than 1.6 million kilowatts of generating equipment. However, during the "August 15th" period, these facilities suffered damage from Japanese invaders, and particularly after the "August 15th," they were subjected to devastating destruction by the Kuomintang. Most of the equipment was lost, and some could not be restored. Since the People's Government took over, it has gradually carried out arduous repairs and adjustments, allowing this industrial lifeline to begin to recover. The efficiency of power plants in some power areas has also gradually improved due to the initial strengthening of enterprise management. In the future, to coordinate with the large-scale industrial and mining construction in Northeast China, the working policy of each electric power bureau is to use forces in a unified and focused manner, and to begin to conserve resources, strengthen the guarantee of power transmission, and strengthen enterprise management and democratization in management, so as to increase the amount of power transmitted to twice that of 1948 within the year. In terms of continuing restoration work, it is planned to increase power generation by 40,000 kilowatts within the year, repair and add 39 large substations, build 380 kilometers of new transmission lines, and repair 1,000 kilometers of old lines. In terms of saving electricity and regulating electricity consumption, preparations are being made to cancel or reduce unnecessary or secondary electricity use when necessary to ensure electricity use for basic industries. The average power loss should be reduced to below 30% (power generally has losses from power plants to electricity users, but the current loss rate is too high, with a total average of over 30%, and some reaching 40% to 50%). According to the primary and secondary importance of electricity consumption, transmission lines are divided into four types: A, B, C, and D, so that adjustments and handling can be made when necessary. To strengthen the management of power transmission, it has been decided to add 16 security telephone lines, totaling 800 kilometers in length, and repair lines and security installations. To complete these tasks, the Northeast Electric Power Line Bureau has further decided that in the second half of this year, it will require its eight subordinate bureaus to achieve standardized enterprise management, with each work having a definite and specific plan, thoroughly clearing assets, implementing quota management for raw materials, labor, and power generation quantity, and establishing a standardized budget and final accounting system.

    配合全境大规模工矿建设
    东北积极发展电力
    年内将使送电量达到上年两倍
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北国营电业经过长期的艰苦恢复和建设后，已使全境的电力比一年以前增加了将近一倍，变电容量增加十万千伏特安培（简称伏安），特高压送电路增加一千五百公里。其中火力发电的供电量比一九四七年前提高一倍半，百分之七十八都用于工矿建设。东北的电业原来基础较好，“八一五”前南满、中满、东满三个发电网，各有水力及火力发电之配合，并有超高压线互相送电，共有发电设备一百六十余万基罗瓦特。然在“八一五”时，这些设备遭受日寇破坏，特别是“八一五”以后，又受国民党毁灭性的摧残，设备大部损失，有的且已不能恢复。人民政府接收以来，逐步地进行艰苦修建及调整，使这一工业命脉开始复苏，若干电力区的发电厂亦由于初步加强了企业化的管理，效能逐渐提高。今后为配合全东北大规模的工矿建设，各电业局的工作方针是：统一地有重点地使用力量，并开始节流，加强送电的保证，在管理上加强企业化、民主化，以便在年内把送电量提高到一九四八年的两倍。在继续恢复工作方面：计划年内增加发电量四万基罗瓦特，修理及增设大变电所三十九处，新建送电线三百八十公里，修补旧线路一千公里。在节省电力和调剂用电上，准备必要时取消或减少不必要的或次要的用电，保证基本工业用电。要使电力的损失平均减少到百分之三十以下（电力从发电厂到用电户一般均有损失，但现在损失率太高，总平均是百分之三十以上，有的达百分之四十至五十）。根据用电的主要、次要，把送电线分为甲乙丙丁四种，以便必要时调整处理。在加强送电管理上，决定添设保安电话线路十六条，共长八百公里，并修理线路及保安装置等。为完成这些任务，东北电业线局更决定今年下半年要求其所辖的八个分局均做到正规的企业化管理，各项工作均有确实的具体计划，彻底清理资产，实行原材料，劳力、发电数量等的定额管理，建立正规的预决算制度。
