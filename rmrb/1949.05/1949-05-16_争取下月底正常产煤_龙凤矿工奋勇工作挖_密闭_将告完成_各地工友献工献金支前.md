Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: Thirty-six rescue team workers at the Fushun Longfeng Coal Mine have been working diligently in the high temperatures of the pit for four months and have already excavated two-thirds of the "sealed area" of the Ajingou. This is a major step in enabling the Longfeng Coal Mine to resume normal production. The Ajingou coal pit tunnels were sealed immediately after a fire broke out in the autumn of 1945 to prevent a conflagration. At that time, ten water pumps were also sealed inside. The pit is only 300 meters away from the Hun River, and the normal underground water seepage is 1,500 cubic meters per hour, exceeding this amount during the rainy season, causing serious flooding throughout the Longfeng Mine. When the Kuomintang ruled Fushun, they only cared about mining coal and not about drainage, so that by the time Fushun was liberated last winter, Ajingou had accumulated 35,000 cubic meters of water, which seeped into other pits in the Longfeng Mine, reducing the daily coal production of 5,500 tons to 100 tons. According to engineers' estimates, if the water cannot be pumped out again this rainy season, the entire mine will be flooded. After liberation, the mine actively planned to open the "sealed area" of Ajingou so that the ten water pumps sealed inside could resume pumping. At the beginning of January this year, after testing proved that the fire in the pit had been extinguished, the mine began to reorganize the rescue team of the security section, explaining the importance of opening the "sealed area" of Ajingou and calling on team members to participate voluntarily. The team members rushed to sign up, and except for a few who did not meet the health requirements, the remaining twenty-eight all participated, starting work on January 10. A few days later, eight more workers were added, totaling thirty-six. When the sealed opening was first opened, the temperature in the pit had reached 45 degrees Celsius, and it reached 78 degrees Celsius at 60 meters. In the thick smoke, you could not see your fingers, the workers' eyes were burning, and a layer of black skin formed on their faces. If they stood in one place for too long, there was a risk of burning the rubber soles of their shoes. However, the workers unanimously insisted on working without flinching. Worker Sun Huichen said: "The Communist Party saved our lives with great difficulty. None of us want to die, but the task is more important than life. If the soldiers at the front were afraid of death, they could not win battles." Among them, ten or so workers were successively overcome by the hot air, but as soon as they were cured, they would automatically carry the life-saving device down the hole again. The Central Party Committee and administrative leaders of the Longfeng Mine regularly understood the situation throughout the work process, helped the workers solve difficulties, and instructed the clinic to check the team members' health every day, paying special attention to the treatment, care, and comfort of the injured team members. This further encouraged the team members greatly in spirit. Thanks to the workers' selfless work over the past four months, two-thirds of the entire project has been completed. Another sixty to seventy meters of excavation will reach the location of the original water pumps. It is expected that water pumping can be restored by the end of June, saving the entire mine from the Hun River flood and restoring normal coal production.

[Broadcast by the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Shenyang, 15th: Workers from various coal mines, gold mines, and other state-owned factories in the Northeast are enthusiastically donating labor and money to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China. On the day of labor donation, every worker in the Fushun Coal Mine generally did two days' worth of work. On that day, the output of the Fuguo Mine in the Fourth Mining Area exceeded the usual output by more than double. Among the less than one thousand workers in the machinery factory of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, 922 workers donated labor and money. Workers at the Tuoyaozi Gold Mine donated a total of 56 taels, 3 fen, and 7 li of placer gold. In addition, workers from factories such as the Shenyang Rubber Factory and the Iron and Steel Plant also donated money and other慰劳품.

　　争取下月底正常产煤
  　龙凤矿工奋勇工作挖“密闭”将告完成
    各地工友献工献金支前
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】抚顺龙凤煤矿三十六名救护队工人在坑穴高温中奋力工作四个月，已挖开阿金沟“密闭”的三分之二。这是使龙凤煤矿将得以恢复正常产量的重大步骤。阿金沟煤坑坑道在一九四五年秋起火后立即被严密封闭，以免酿成火灾。当时有十台抽水机也被封闭在内。该坑距浑河仅三百公尺，平时地下浸水量为每小时一千五百立方公尺，雨季时更超过此量，因而造成了全龙凤矿的严重水灾。国民党统治抚顺时，只顾挖煤，不管排水，以致去冬抚顺解放时，阿金沟已积水三万五千立方公尺，积水且渗入龙凤矿内其他坑，使每日产煤五千五百吨的龙凤矿减至日产一百吨。据工程师估计，如今年雨季再无法抽水，全矿均将被淹。解放后，该矿乃积极筹划打开阿金沟“密闭”，使被封闭在内的抽水机十台能恢复抽水。今年一月初，该矿在试验证明坑内火已熄灭后，即着手整顿保安股的救护队，说明打开阿金沟“密闭”的重要性，号召队员自动参加。队员们抢先报名，除了几个因健康条件不够外，其余二十八人全部参加，于一月十日开始工作，几天后又增加工人八名，共为三十六名。在密闭口刚打开时，坑内温度已达摄氏四十五度，进到六十公尺时即达七十八度，浓烟中伸手不辨五指，工人们眼睛烤得发辣，脸上烤得起了一层黑皮，在一个地方站久了，胶底鞋就有烤焦的危险。但工人们一致坚持工作，毫不畏缩。工友孙会臣说：“共产党好容易救了咱们的命。咱们没有一个人想死，可是任务比生命更重要。前方的战士要是怕死就不能打胜仗。”他们中先后曾有十来个工友被炽热的空气薰倒，但一被治好他们便又自动背着救命器下洞。龙凤矿的中央党委和行政负责人在整个工作过程中经常了解情况，帮助工人们解决困难，同时责成医务所每天为队员检查身体，并特别注意对受伤队员的治疗、照顾和慰问。这更使队员们在精神上得到很大的鼓舞。由于工人们四个月来奋不顾身的工作，整个工程已完成三分之二，再挖六十至七十公尺即可达到原设抽水机的位置，预计六月底即可恢复抽水，使全矿免受浑河水患，恢复正常的产煤量。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】沈阳十五号消息：东北各煤矿、金矿和其他公营工厂工友，热烈献工、献金、支援人民解放军解放全中国。在献工的那一天，抚顺煤矿每个工人都普遍的作了平时两天的工作，第四矿区富国矿工人当天产量超过平时产量一倍以上。本溪煤铁公司机械厂全体不到一千个工人当中，就有九百二十二人献工和献金。驼腰子金矿工友一共献出了砂金五十六两三分七厘。另外沈阳橡胶厂炼铁厂等厂工友，也献出了献金和其他慰劳品。
