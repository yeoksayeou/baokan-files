    A Typical Investigation of Organizational Adjustment
    Ping City Tap Water Company is Gradually Solving the Problem
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the opinions and demands of employees and water users, the Beiping City Tap Water Company is starting to adjust the unreasonable personnel organization of the past and is now gradually proceeding. Before March 1937 of the Republic of China, the company was managed by the Kuomintang Beiping Municipal Government and was called the "Beiping Tap Water Management Office." Under the director and deputy director, there were five sections responsible for all business operations. At that time, there were a total of 497 employees. After March of that year, the company was renamed "Tap Water Company," and Xi Chaomin was appointed as the manager. After that, the company's organization became increasingly large, and the number of non-production personnel increased sharply. However, the company's business did not develop. On the contrary, water pipes that had been built for a long time gradually deteriorated, and leaks frequently reached about 40 percent. At that time, because Xi Chaomin disregarded the needs of the enterprise and deliberately courted two people from Tianjin, Mr. Guo and Mr. Qiao, the original five sections were changed to five divisions (General Affairs, Engineering, Business, Accounting, and Materials), with Mr. Guo and Mr. Qiao serving as division chiefs. Parallel to the five divisions were two offices, namely the Secretariat and Personnel Office, as well as organizations such as the Chief Inspector, Commissioners, and Welfare Committee. Under the five divisions were fourteen sections, two offices, thirteen units, and three water plants. In addition, there were the board of directors and various consultants (such as medical consultants). At the time of Beiping's liberation, the number of employees had increased to 581. The increase in redundant staff increased the company's unnecessary expenses, thereby increasing the burden on water users. In February of this year, there were 282 workers and 268 staff members. Excluding personnel with specific jobs, this included 16 board of directors staff members who had no work or very little work, 20 directors and supervisors, 63 other redundant personnel (including staff and workers), and 11 Kuomintang secret service personnel (who have been released from the factory and are undergoing training), totaling 110 people, accounting for 20 percent of the total number of employees. In February, worker salaries were 1,303,628 yuan (equivalent to 105,203 jin of rice), and staff salaries were 1,900,055 yuan (equivalent to 140,042 jin of rice). However, the expenses of non-production personnel among the staff, such as the board of directors, redundant directors and supervisors, and secret service personnel, reached 716,098 yuan, accounting for about 40 percent of the total staff salaries. The total water fee revenue in February was 9,861,800 yuan, equivalent to 257,428 jin of rice (when the rice price was 17.5 yuan per jin), and the total salary expenditure was 3,368,813 yuan, equivalent to 257,428 jin of rice. The expenses of non-production personnel increased the cost per ton of water by 6.3 jiao. These unnecessary expenses reduced the company's ability to add equipment. Water pipes installed more than 40 years ago are frequently leaking due to lack of maintenance, causing inconvenience to users, who also have to share the costs. In the past, some purely bureaucratic organizations existed within the company, such as inspectors, commissioners, consultants, and the board of directors. Most of these personnel did not work at the factory, but received a large amount of salary or carriage fees each month. In February alone, the directors and supervisors received 34,500 yuan in carriage fees. Some organizations were too large, with too many people and nothing to do. For example, each of the five divisions had a secretary, a drafter, and a voucher clerk. The Engineering Division should have had 72 people according to actual needs, but now it has 111. The General Affairs Section actually needs 12 people, but now it has more than 30. There are as many as 17 section and unit chiefs in the Engineering Division. Because there are so many chiefs, even small matters have to go through many procedures and departments, forming a bureaucratic runaround, reducing work efficiency, and prolonging work time. After learning about the above-mentioned unreasonable situations, the Ping City Enterprise Bureau, based on the opinions and demands of water users and the company's general employees, began to carry out reasonable adjustments. The company was ordered to convene a meeting of all staff and some workers yesterday (the 11th) morning to solicit employees' opinions on organizational adjustment. Every attendee wrote an opinion letter. Workers also raised their own opinions at another meeting. The company is now adjusting according to the opinions of all employees and past materials.

    调整机构的一个典型调查
    平市自来水公司正逐步解决
    【本报讯】北平市自来水公司根据职工及用水户的意见和要求，着手调整过去不合理的人事机构，现正逐步进行中。该公司在民国三十七年三月以前，为国民党北平市政府代管，名为“北平自来水管理处”。正副处长以下设五科，经营所有业务。当时职工共四九七人。当年三月后公司改名为“自来水公司”，由郗超民任经理。此后公司机构日趋庞大，非生产人员骤增。但公司业务并未发展，相反，建筑很久之水管子日渐毁坏，经常漏水达百分之四十左右。当时因郗超民不顾企业需要，有意拉拢从天津调来之郭某乔某二人，故将原五科改为五处（总务、工务、业务、会计、材料），以郭、乔二人分任处长。与五处平行者尚有秘书、人事二室，及总稽查、专员、福利委员会等组织。五处之下又分十四科、两室、十三股及三个水场。另外还有董事部、各种顾问（如医药顾问）等人员。北平解放时职工共增到五八一人。冗员增多，公司不必要的开支随之增大，从而加重了用水户的负担。今年二月份工人共二八二人，职员二六八人，除去有一定工作的人员外，包括没工作或很少有工作的董事部职员十六人，董监事二十人，其他冗员（职员及工人中都有）六十三人，国民党特务人员十一人（解放后已出厂受训），共一百一十人，占总人数百分之二十。二月份工人薪金为一三○三六二八元（折米一○五二○三斤），职员薪金为一九○○○五五元（折米一四○○四二斤）。但职员中之非生产人员如董事部。董监事冗员及特务人员之开支即达七一六○九八元，占职员薪金总数百分之四十左右。二月份水费总收入为九八六一八○○元，折米二五七四二八斤（当时米价每斤米十七元五），薪金总开支为三三六八八一三元，折米二五七四二八斤。非生产人员之开支使每公吨水增加成本六角三分。这些不必要的开支，减少了公司添增设备的力量。按装四十余年之水管子因无力整修，经常漏水，用户既感不便，还得平均负担出钱。公司内部过去有些纯官僚机构，如稽查、专员、顾问、董事部等人员，大部不到厂办公，每月却支出很多薪金或夫马费，仅董监事二月份即支夫马费三四五○○元。有些机构过于庞大，人多没事干。如五处每处都有秘书、起稿、传票各一人。工务处按实际需要应为七二人，现在则有一一一人。总务科实际需要十二人，现在则有三十余人。工务处各科、股头目即达十七人之多。由于头目众多。一点小事情都要经过很多手续和部门，形成公文旅行，减弱工作效率，拖长工作时间。平市企业局了解上述各种不合理的情况后，根据用水户及该公司一般职工的意见与要求，即着手进行合理调整。责成该公司于昨日（十一日）上午召开所有职员及部分工人会议，征求职工对调整机构的意见。每个到会者都写了意见书。工人也在另一次会议上提出了自己意见，现在该公司正根据全体职工意见及过去材料进行调整中。
