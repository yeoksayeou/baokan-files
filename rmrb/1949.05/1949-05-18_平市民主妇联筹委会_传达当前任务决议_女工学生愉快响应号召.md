　　Peking Municipal Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee
  　Conveys Resolutions on Current Tasks
  　Female Workers and Students Happily Respond to the Call
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Following the official announcement yesterday (the 17th) of the resolution by the National Women's Congress on "The Current Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement," the Peking Municipal Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, in order to implement this resolution, has conducted six rounds of briefings among women of all strata in Peking since the conclusion of the Congress. Female workers from factories across the city, female students and teachers from major middle schools and universities, professional women from various agencies and organizations, and female cadres listened to the briefings on this resolution and subsequently engaged in in-depth collective discussions and study. Some units have already promptly reflected their opinions. Female workers from the clothing factories, which have the largest number of female workers in Peking, happily said after listening to the conveyance of the resolution: Previously, we did not understand what the women's movement was. Now, we not only understand, but we also further recognize and are aware of the role that our working class plays in the women's movement, and we deeply understand the importance of developing industrial production. In the future, we will more firmly establish our stance, work hard to accelerate production, and establish a new labor attitude. Female workers Yu Xiuqing, Wang Yuping, Qi Jingxian, Zhang Jiyu, and others from Clothing Factory No. 3 happily took out their notes from the briefing and told reporters: After listening to the briefing, we feel very different from before. We not only recognize the power of our own workers, but also recognize the greatness of the Communist Party. We must respond to the call of the Congress, work hard to develop production, support the front lines, and liberate all the workers and people of China. After listening to the briefing on the resolution, female students from Peking University, Yenching University, and other universities and middle schools gained a new understanding of the issue of intellectuals integrating with workers and peasants, and of the heroic deeds of working women in the liberated areas.
