    【Taiyuan Electric News】The "Workers' Information Office" attached to the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions has achieved remarkable work results in the past few days. From the 26th of last month to the end of the month, a total of 522 people arrived at the office for inquiries in five days. 90% of them received answers on the spot, and 30% of them were directly introduced to work after the Information Office's preliminary review. This included: 59 electrical workers introduced to the electric company to participate in line repairs; 11 automobile workers introduced to the Military Control Commission and the Automobile Management Office; 72 unemployed workers introduced back to the office to participate in production for self-reliance; and 10 unemployed workers from other professions. In total, 152 people were introduced. The difficult questions raised by those who did not receive immediate answers were forwarded by the Information Office to relevant departments for consultation, processing, and answering. Most of the questions raised by the inquirers were requests for resumption of work, job searches, or requests for solutions to immediate issues such as food and housing. The greatest achievement of the Information Office was that, while answering questions, it took the opportunity to briefly conduct various policy propaganda for the inquirers, enabling them to have a preliminary understanding of the various policies and decrees of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    太原职工问事处工作成绩显著
    【太原电】华北总工会太原办事处附设之“职工问事处”数日来已获得显著工作成绩，上月二十六号至月底五天中到达该处问事者共五二二人，其中百分之九十均当面获得了解答，并有百分之三十经问事处初步审查后，直接介绍了工作；计有：介绍到电灯公司参加抢修线路的电业工人五十九人；介绍到军管会与汽车管理处的汽车工人十一人；介绍回办事处参加生产自救的失业工人七十二人，介绍了其他职业的各行失业工人十人，总计一百五十二人。未获当面解答者所提出之疑难问题，均由问事处转达各有关部门商酌处理与解答，询问者所提出之问题大部分是请求复工或找寻职业或请求解决眼下吃饭、住房等问题，该问事处最大收获是在解答问题时，趁便简明地对询问者做了各种政策宣传，使询问者对共产党，人民政府的各项政策法令有了初步了解。
