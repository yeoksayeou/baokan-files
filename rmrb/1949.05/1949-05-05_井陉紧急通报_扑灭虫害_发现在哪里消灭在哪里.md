    Jingxing Urgent Notice
    Eradicate Pests
    "Eradicate Wherever They Are Found"
    [This Dispatch] The Jingxing County Production Committee recently issued an urgent notice, calling for organized efforts to eradicate pests.
    The notice stated: On April 24th, Comrades Wang Jing and Li Lei from the County Party Committee visited Faluling in the ninth district to inspect work. Village cadres reported that five-colored worms (armyworms) had been found on wheat in the southeast of the village. They were six to seven fen in length, with white bellies and backs that were either black or grass-green, with red heads. There were several worms on each wheat plant. The industrial committee member's family had three mu of wheat, all of which had worms. They had been catching them for two days without finishing, and were simply crying in distress. Now, the infestation has spread to approximately 20 mu of land. If not eradicated immediately, it will inevitably spread to the entire village and even the entire district, causing even greater harm to the wheat. Therefore, Comrades Wang and Li have instructed the village cadres and the district cadres stationed in the village to immediately organize the entire village's population to carry out eradication.
    In order to protect the wheat from pest damage, all cadres and masses in our county should immediately inspect the wheat fields. If any pest damage is found, in addition to reporting it at each level, we must immediately organize all forces to quickly eradicate it. If pest damage is discovered but not reported with delays, the village cadres shall bear full responsibility.
    The notice concluded by emphasizing: We must "eradicate wherever they are found," to ensure the wheat harvest.

    井陉紧急通报
    扑灭虫害
    “发现在哪里消灭在哪里”
    【本报讯】井陉县生产委员会顷发出紧急通报，号召组织起来扑灭害虫。
    通报称：四月二十四日，县委机关王靖、李雷二位同志，到九区乏驴岭检查工作，村干部在汇报时说，村东南麦子上，发现了五色虫（按即是黏虫）身长六七分，肚是白色，背有的是黑色，有的是草绿色，红头，一棵麦就有好几条。该村实业委员家三亩麦子，都有了虫，捉了两天也没捉完，愁的只是哭，现在已经蔓延到二十亩地左右。如不即时扑灭，势必蔓延到全村以至全区，对麦子为害更大。因此，王李二同志已责成村干部与驻村区干部，立即组织全村群众进行扑灭。
    为了使麦子不受虫害，我全县干部群众应立即到麦田检查，如有虫害发生，除逐级汇报外，必须马上组织全力迅速扑灭。如有发现虫害而拖延不报，村干部应负全部责任。
    最后强调指出：必须“发现在哪里，消灭在哪里。”保证麦子的收成。
