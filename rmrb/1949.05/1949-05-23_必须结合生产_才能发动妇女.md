　　Taihang Telegram: The Taihang Fifth Special District has three approaches to mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production: The first, exemplified by Fuyang Village in Ci County, breaks away from the past practice of mobilizing women in isolation. Instead, it transforms women's mobilization into a conscious requirement of the Party branch, closely linking it with the immediate interests of peasants in increasing production and becoming prosperous. This overcomes resistance to mobilizing women quickly and yields great results, making it an experience worth promoting. The second approach, while also combining with production, lacks a unified pace and mobilizes women in isolation. Without sufficient ideological mobilization, it prematurely emphasizes organizational forms, eagerly establishing women's representative conferences and stressing the improvement of meeting systems. As a result, the women's representative conferences easily become a formality, and social resistance is not overcome. In some villages, female cadres are beaten and scolded by men for attending meetings. In terms of guiding ideology, it excessively emphasizes that women's labor is for their own share of land, violating the spirit of male-female division of labor, cooperation, and unity in production, which is met with resistance from men. Some women are also not conscious, which shows that without starting from production and isolating the promotion of women's special interests, the peasants' thinking cannot be raised, and women's own interests cannot be guaranteed. The third approach involves detaching from the current reality and isolating the resolution of women's special sufferings, passively halting women's work on checking feudal ideology in a way that is detached from reality. As a result, women cannot be mobilized, and special sufferings cannot be resolved. This approach must be quickly corrected.

　　必须结合生产  才能发动妇女
    【太行电】太行五专区在发动妇女参加农业生产上，存在着三种作法：第一种，如磁县滏阳村，打破了过去孤立发动妇女，而把发动妇女变成支部自觉的要求，与农民当前增产发家的利益密切结合起来，打破发动妇女的阻力，时间短，收效大，是值得发挥的经验。第二种，虽然也结合生产，但缺乏统一步调，而是孤立的发动妇女；没有充分的思想发动，便过早的强调组织形式，急于建立妇代会，强调健全会议制度，这样搞的结果，妇代会容易流于形式，社会阻力也未打破，有的村妇女干部，因开会被男人打骂。在指导思想上，过分强调妇女劳动是为自己一份地，违反男女分工合作团结生产的精神，而遭到男人抵抗。部分妇女也不自觉，这就说明不从生产出发，孤立的宣传妇女特殊利益，农民思想提不高，妇女本身利益也保障不了。第三种，是脱离当前实际孤立的解决妇女特殊痛苦，消极的把妇女工作停留在脱离实际的检查封建思想上。这样结果，妇女发动不起来，特殊痛苦也解决不好，这种作法，必须迅速纠正。
