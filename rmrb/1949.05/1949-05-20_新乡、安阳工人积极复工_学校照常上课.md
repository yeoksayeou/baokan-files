　　【Taihang Telegraph】After the liberation of Xinxiang, it brought infinite joy to the people of the city. Before the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they posted slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to liberate Xinxiang," "Long live the Communist Party," and "Chairman Mao is our savior." Workers of the Pinghan Railway elected a delegation to welcome the People's Liberation Army several times in Mengjiaying, south of the city. Workers and citizens organized a public security committee to protect public buildings from sabotage, protecting most of the public housing. After the People's Liberation Army officially entered the city, the city's order was good, and all primary and secondary schools continued to have classes as usual. The Chengxing Yarn Factory only stopped work for a few hours when the Chiang bandits left the city to prevent sabotage. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it immediately resumed work. Workers at the flour mill had already stopped work and disbanded, but as soon as our takeover team arrived in the suburbs, the workers demanded a quick resumption of work. Railway workers rushed to register and automatically went to the fortifications built by the enemy to search for various transportation materials in preparation for repairing the Pinghan Road. The industrial and commercial enterprises destroyed by the Chiang bandits, which had long been closed, reopened for business after the publicity of our party's policy of protecting industry and commerce and with specific assistance. In three days, 40 to 50 percent of small and medium-sized businesses, especially handicrafts and workshops, had successively opened for business. The streets were crowded with people, and the city's appearance was becoming more prosperous. Market prices generally fell. Merchants said: "Once Anyang and Xinxiang are liberated, the north and south will be connected, and merchants can come and go, which is much easier!"
    【Taihang Telegraph】The Cultural and Educational Department of the Anyang Military Control Commission convened a meeting of teachers and staff from various schools in the city on the 7th of this month to discuss the issue of school resumption. On the 9th, teachers and students of various schools actively cleaned up the school buildings and officially resumed classes. Approximately 3,400 teachers and students from the former County Middle School, County Normal School, Zhangde Middle School, Dagong Middle School, Chongzhen Middle School, and sixteen primary schools gathered at the Dagong Middle School stadium to hold a resumption ceremony.
    Also: On the second day of Anyang's liberation, the Anyang branch of the Taihang Xinhua Bookstore moved into the city and began business. On the same day, the Anyang Municipal People's Education Center also officially opened. Workers, citizens, students, and merchants went to both places to read books and newspapers.

　　新乡、安阳工人积极复工
  　学校照常上课
    【太行电】新乡解放后，给该城人民带来了无限的欢欣。在解放军未入城前，他们即张贴了“欢迎解放军解放新乡”，“共产党万岁”，“毛主席是我们的救星”等各色标语口号，平汉铁路工人选出了代表团，到城南孟家营数次迎接解放军。工人和市民为了防止破坏分子破坏公共建筑物，组织了治安委员会，保护了大部分公房。解放军正式入城后，市内秩序良好，各中小学照常上课。成兴纱厂仅在蒋匪开出城时为了防止破坏，停工数小时，解放军入城后，即马上开工。面粉厂的工人本来早已停工散伙，但我接管组一到市郊，工人们便纷纷要求迅速复工。铁路工人争来登记，并自动到敌人修筑的工事内，搜寻各种交通器材，准备修复平汉路。被蒋匪摧毁的早已歇业了的工商业，经宣传我党保护工商业政策和在具体帮助下，三天工夫，即有百分之四、五十的中小商业，特别是手工业、作坊已先后开张营业。街头人群拥挤，市容日趋繁盛。市场物价普遍下降。商人说：“安阳新乡一解放，南北通了气，商贩能来能去，可活便的多啦！”
    【太行电】安阳军管会文教部于本月七日召集该市各学校教职员开会，研讨复学复课问题后，九日各学校师生则积极整理校舍，正式复课。原县立中学、县立师范、彰德中学、大公中学、崇真中学及十六座小学师生约三千四百余人，齐集大公中学体育场，举行复课典礼。
    又：安阳市解放第二天，太行新华书店安阳分店，即移到城内开始营业。同日，安阳市民众教育馆亦正式开放。前往两处阅读书报的，有：工人、市民、学生、商人等。
