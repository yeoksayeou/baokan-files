Soviet Writers Answer British Writers' Questions

    Question: With whom do Soviet writers discuss their planned works? (British writer J.B. Priestley)

    Answer: Soviet writers widely practice preliminary discussions of the themes, materials, and forms of their planned works. First, this is done by the Soviet Writers' Union and its various groups (prose writers group, poets group, playwrights group, etc.). Secondly, discussions are held by the publishing houses, where an author's work is usually assigned to the same editor, who becomes the author's first reader, advisor, and critic for many years. If the planned work is a play or a film script, its plan is often discussed by theater and film workers. However, such prior discussion is not mandatory, and of course, some writers are unwilling to discuss their work before they write it. (Soviet writer S. Marshak).
    In our opinion, discussing written drafts (at meetings of the Writers' Union departments, in writers' clubs, at reader meetings, in libraries, etc.) is more beneficial than discussing the plan of a work. Personally, I never discuss what I intend to write; I still believe in the old custom, "Don't talk about the child before it is born." (Soviet writer M. Shaginyan)

    Question: Suppose a Soviet writer has used up his royalties, but for some reason feels unprepared to write anything, what does he do? (J.B. Priestley)

    Answer: When a Soviet writer needs money, he can obtain a loan from the "Literary Fund," a writers' mutual aid organization. Its fund comes from the publishing houses and theaters donating one-tenth of the royalties from each published work (but not deducted from the writer's royalties, the writer's royalties are paid in full) and two percent of the box office revenue from each play. If necessary, the "Literary Fund" also provides writers and their families with convalescent facilities and other forms of assistance. When necessary, a Soviet writer can also receive a non-refundable grant from the "Literary Fund," or accept a commission from a newspaper, publishing house, or magazine to travel and write about his experiences, or to collect materials for a work, all expenses paid by the commissioning agency. (M. Shaginyan).
    According to Soviet copyright law, playwrights receive a percentage of all box office revenue from performances across the country. Screenwriters receive a percentage based on the film's distribution revenue. Prose writers and poets receive royalties for each edition of their old works and are entitled to an advance from the publishing house for the royalties of planned works. In addition, they can receive assistance from the Literary Fund. (Soviet writer Georgy Mdivani)

    If a writer cannot receive an advance for a new work (if he has not yet started writing), he still has many opportunities to make a living. He can write articles on any topic for any newspaper, write character stories, news briefs, and essays for various periodicals, and he can also read his published works on the radio. In addition, he can recite his works in workers' clubs, etc., or, according to a contract with the "Literary Recitation Bureau," he can travel to various cities in the Soviet Union, giving lectures or recitations of his own novels or poems. In addition, he can compile prose from the literature of various Soviet nationalities. Secondly, he can work for film studios, writing film scripts, subtitles for newsreels, or dialogue for sound films. He can also write pamphlets on various popular issues. If, due to poor health, all these opportunities are not feasible for him, he will receive help in the form of a trip to a sanatorium or hospital from the Writers' Union Council or the "Literary Fund," or a grant. (Soviet writer N. Tikhonov)

　　苏联作家答英国作家问
    问：苏联作家跟什么人讨论他们计划中的作品呢？（英国作家Ｊ·普里斯特莱）
    答：苏联作家之间广泛地实行着预先讨论计划中的作品的主题、材料和形式。首先，这是由苏联作家协会及其各组（散文作家组、诗人组、剧作家组等等）来进行的。其次，则由出版局来进行讨论，在这里，一个作者的作品通常是交给同一位编辑，以致他成了这位作者的第一个读者、顾问和批评家，连续好几年之久。如果这个计划中的作品是一个剧本或是一个电影脚本，它的计划常常由剧场和制片工作者来进行讨论。然而，这样的一种事先讨论，并不是必须举行的，当然，有一些作家在他们写作之前是不愿意讨论他们的作品的。（苏联作家Ｓ·玛尔沙克）。
    在我们看来，讨论写成的草稿（在作家协会各部的会议上，在作家俱乐部中，在读者会上，在图书馆中等等）比讨论一部作品的计划更为有益。就我个人来说，我从不讨论我所想写的东西；我依然相信旧的习俗，孩子未出世，不讲孩子。（苏联作家Ｍ·莎金娘）
    问：假定一位苏联作家用尽了他的版税，但是，为着某种理由觉得并不准备写什么，那末，他怎么办呢？（Ｊ·普里斯特莱）
    答：一个苏联作家需要钱的时候，可以向“文学基金会”取得一笔贷款，这是一个作家互济的团体，它的基金是由出版局和剧场捐献每部已出版作品的版税十分之一（但是不并从作家的版税中扣除，作家的版税是全数照付的）和每场戏卖座收入的百分之二而来的。如果有必要的话，“文学基金会”也供给作家及其家属疗养的便利以及其他形式的援助。必要的时候，一个苏联的作家还可以从“文学基金会”得到一笔不需偿还的赠金，或是接受一家报纸、出版局或是杂志的委托，出去旅行并写作他的经历，或是为一部作品搜集材料，一切的费用均由该委托机关付给。（Ｍ·莎金娘）。
    按照苏联的版权法，剧作家得从全国各处所有演出卖座收入中提取百分数。电影脚本作者根据影片的发行额提取百分数。散文作家和诗人则按照旧作品的每一版提取版税，并且得向出版局预支计划中作品的版税。此外，他们还可以从文学基金会得到援助。（苏联作家乔治·姆第凡尼）
    如果一位作家不能预支一部新作品的版税（倘使他还没有着手写作），他还有很多维持生活的机会。他可以为任何报纸写任何题目的专文，为各种期刊写人物故事、新闻缩写和杂文，他还可以在广播中选读他的已出版的作品。此外，他也可以在工人俱乐部等处朗诵他的作品，或者，按照与“文学朗诵局”所订的合同，他可以游历苏联各城市，演讲或朗诵他自己的小说或诗歌。此外，他还可以编译苏联各民族文学的散文。其次，他也可以为制片厂工作，编写电影脚本、新闻片的字幕或是有声片的对白。他也可以写作关于各种通俗问题的小册子。如果由于健康不良，所有这些机会他都行不通了，他将用前往休养地或病院的形式从作家协会理事会或者“文学基金会”得到帮助或是一笔赠金。（苏联作家Ｎ·吉洪诺夫）
