　　Wuhan is the general name for Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. The three cities stand like a tripod, with a total population of 1.2 to 1.3 million. Wuchang is a famous historical city where the Xinhai Revolution first broke out. It is now the capital of Hubei Province and the political and educational center of Hubei. Hankou is the largest commercial port in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It was the hub of the Kuomintang's rule in Central China. The White bandit Chongxi's pseudo-Central China "Bandit Suppression" General Headquarters was located here. Hanyang was originally a military industrial and heavy industrial city. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, its steel plant and arsenal were moved westward.

　　The three towns are located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers. Wuchang is located south of the Yangtze River, Hankou is located north of the Yangtze River, and Hanyang is located on the triangular land where the Yangtze and Han rivers meet. Water and land transportation are extremely convenient. The Pinghan and Yuehan railways both end here, connecting North, Central, and South China. Highways radiate in all directions, reaching Changsha, Nanchang, Yichang, Shashi, Xi'an, Anqing, Kaifeng, and other places. Water transport is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with steamships reaching Yibin in Sichuan to the west and Shanghai to the east. Along the Xiang River, one can navigate to Changsha, Changde, and Xiangtan, and along the Xiang River, one can reach Xiantao and Yuekou.

　　The industry and commerce of the three towns have always been well-developed. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 500 machine factories, and their products were sold outside the province in addition to supplying the province. In terms of light industry, the output of textiles, flour, and cigarettes was the largest, with a daily output of 26,000 bags of flour. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the textile industry could produce 42,000 pounds of fine cloth per day. The current production capacity is half of what it was before the war.

　　The three towns have twelve colleges and universities, including Wuhan University and Zhonghua University, with more than 5,000 students, and more than 90 secondary schools with more than 40,000 students.

　　武汉介绍
    武汉为武昌、汉口、汉阳之总称。三地鼎足而立，共有人口一百二、三十万。武昌为历史名城，辛亥革命即首先在此起义。现为湖北省省会，是湖北政治、教育的中心。汉口是长江中游的最大商埠，是国民党统治华中的枢纽，白匪崇禧的伪华中“剿匪”总司令部即设于此。汉阳原为一军事工业与重工业城市，抗日战争后，其钢铁厂及兵工厂已西迁。
    三镇位于长江与汉水合流之处，武昌居江南，汉口居江北，汉阳则位江汉合流的三角地带上。水陆交通均极便利。平汉、粤汉两条铁路均以此为终点，连贯华北、华中、华南。公路向四面辐射，直达长沙、南昌、宜昌、沙市、西安、安庆、开封等地。水运居长江中点，上至四川宜宾，下至上海，均可通汽船，沿湘水可航至长沙、常德、湘潭，沿襄河可达仙桃、岳口等地。
    三镇工商业素称发达，抗日战争以前共有机器厂五百余家，产品除供给本省外，尚销外地。轻工业方面以纺织、面粉、卷烟的出产量为最大，面粉日产二万六千袋，纺织业抗日战争以前每日可产细布四万二千磅，现在生产能力为战前之半。
    三镇共有武汉大学、中华大学等专科以上学校十二所，学生五千余人，中等学校九十余所，学生四万余。
