　　After the Tianjin foreign exchange rate was appropriately adjusted and overseas communications were restored on the 19th of this month, import and export trade has become increasingly active. According to statistics from the Tianjin Foreign Exchange, the total foreign exchange transaction volume in the middle ten days of this month (from the 11th to the 20th) was US$114,699.38, HK$388,030.76, and £5,560 7 shillings and 6 pence, an increase of more than double compared to the first ten days of the month. Among them, excluding a small amount of remittances from overseas Chinese, exports accounted for 68.95% of the total transaction volume, and imports accounted for 25.3%. The main export goods were carpets, mountain products, egg products, and horse tails. According to the domestic and foreign prices on the 20th, considerable profits could already be obtained from these exported goods. Miscellaneous goods and egg products were profitable goods for export to Hong Kong. As for imported goods, chemical raw materials, newspapers, and electrical appliances were the most common. Among the designated banks dealing in foreign exchange, the Bank of China still had the largest operating volume, and its throughput also increased with the development of import and export trade. In the past ten days, the bank purchased a total of US$138,603.98 and sold US$51,044.14 (including Hong Kong dollars and pounds), which timely adjusted the supply and demand of foreign exchange. The exchange rate was adjusted four times in the past ten days. Several price increases did not stimulate market prices. For example, after the US dollar exchange rate was raised to 870 yuan, general prices fell instead. The appropriate adjustment of the current exchange rate has clearly achieved the goal of supporting exports.

　　津外汇牌价适当调整后
  　进出口贸易趋活跃
    【天津讯】自本月十九日起外汇牌价调整，及国外电讯恢复后，进出口贸易日趋活跃。据天津外汇交易所统计，本月中旬（十一日至二十日）外汇成交共计美金一一四、六九九·三八元，港币三八八、○三○·七六元，英镑五、五六○镑七先令六便士，较上旬共增加约一倍多。其中除少数侨汇外，出口占总成交百分之六八·九五，进口占百分之二五·三。出口以地毯、山货、蛋品、马尾为大宗，此项出口物资，按二十日国内外价格计算，已可得到相当利润，去香港物资则以杂货、蛋品为有利。至于进口货物，则以化学原料、报纸、电器为多。在经营外汇之各指定银行中，经营量仍以中国银行为最大，吞吐量亦于进出口贸易之开展而增多，一旬来该行共购入一三八、六○三·九八美元，抛出五一、○四四·一四美元（均包括港币及英镑），及时调剂了外汇的供求。按一旬来，牌价共调整四次。几次牌价提高，对市场物价并无刺激，如美汇提到八七○元后，一般物价反落。目前牌价之适宜调整，显已收到扶助出口之目的。
