Hua University First Department, Seventh District Team Students
　Criticize Old Ideas, Establish New Style
　　[Ping City News] Over eight hundred students of the Seventh District Team, First Department of Hua University, residing in Mianhua Hutong, Beiping, have undergone ideological changes after more than two weeks of study. Many students who entered Hua University with a wait-and-see attitude have become active. One student said, "Hua University cadres enthusiastically help us study. The school is simply a different world from the old society." In group meetings, each student actively criticized their past history and erroneous thinking. One student confessed, "Because my family is capitalist, I always felt that the workers didn't work hard enough. When the workers went on strike, I would call the military police to suppress them." Another student said, "In the past, I was neither satisfied with the Kuomintang nor did I agree with the Communist Party. I thought I could avoid offending either side. Now I understand that this path is impossible." Some students voluntarily confessed to having participated in reactionary organizations in the past, and everyone spoke their minds naturally, offering many suggestions to each other. In addition, students have universally strengthened their labor concepts, vying to sweep the courtyard, dining hall, and classrooms. Some groups automatically went to clean the latrines. Each group challenged each other, requesting to launch a competition to observe discipline and learn revolutionary style.

　　华大一部七区队同学
  　批判旧思想　建立新作风
    【平市讯】住在北平棉花胡同的华大第一部第七区队八百余同学，经过两个多星期学习，思想上已起了变化。许多抱着观望态度考入华大的同学，都积极起来了。一个同学说：“华大干部们都热情的帮助我们学习，学校里和旧社会简直是两个世界。”在小组会上每个同学都主动地批判了过去的历史和错误的思想。有一个同学坦白说：“因为我家里是资本家，所以我总嫌工人干活少。工人罢工的时候，我就打电话通知宪兵来镇压”。有一个同学说：“我过去既不满意国民党，又不赞成共产党，我想两面都不得罪，现在我可明白这条路行不通了。”有的同学自动坦白了过去参加过反动的组织，大家都很自然的谈出心里话。彼此提了不少的意见。此外，同学们并普遍的加强了劳动观念，争着扫院子、饭厅、教室。有的小组自动去扫茅房。各小组互相挑战，要求展开一个遵守纪律，学习革命作风的竞赛。
