Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 18th: Florence Dispatch: The 28th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party passed a resolution proposed by the left wing on the 16th, reaffirming close cooperation with the Communist Party. This resolution shattered all hopes of the centrists to split the majority faction in the congress. According to TASS reports, the proposal put forward by the left wing received 220,600 votes, the centrists' proposal received 168,525 votes, and the right wing's proposal received only 41,133 votes. The congress also elected a leadership structure without right-wing elements, including Nenni, Basso, Batai, Cagato, Gabolasso, and Moran. The congress decided to dissolve the National Committee and re-establish the Central Committee, with left-wing representatives gaining 41 seats on the Central Committee, and the centrists and right wing sharing 39 seats.

The extreme right-wing Romita group of the Socialist Party, due to the failure of its attempt to split the Socialist Party at the congress, and under the instigation of the International Socialist Congress currently meeting in The Hague, privately contacted Saragat's United Socialist Party and the Independent Socialist Party outside the congress, plotting to have the right wing withdraw from the Socialist Party. According to TASS, the aim is to establish a "third party" between the Socialist Party and the Saragat Party. The Romita group had to abandon its long-standing policy of conducting anti-leftist activities within the Socialist Party, which is a result of its increasing isolation within the party. Agence France-Presse estimates that the number of Socialist Party members influenced by Romita does not exceed 9.5 percent.

According to Agence France-Presse: The International Socialist Congress in The Hague, expressing "disappointment" with the Italian Socialist Party's decision to continue cooperating with the Communist Party, has decided to "expel" the party.

　　意社会党代表大会通过决议
  　重申与意共紧密合作
    右派一切破坏阴谋均被击败
    【新华社北平十八日电】佛罗伦萨讯：意大利社会党第二十八届代表大会十六日通过左派提出的议案，重申与共产党紧密合作。这一决议打破了中派想分裂大会多数派队伍的一切希望。据塔斯社报导，左派提出的议案得二十二万零六百票，中派的提案得十六万八千五百二十五票，右派的提案仅得四万一千一百三十三票。大会并选出没有右派分子参加的领导机构，其中包括南尼、巴苏、巴太、卡加托尔、加波拉索、摩兰等人。大会决定解散全国委员会，重新建立中央委员会，左派代表将在中央委员中获得四十一席，中派和右派将共获三十九席。
    社会党极右派罗米塔集团，由于在大会上分裂社会党的企图失败，乃在现在海牙开会的国际社会党大会怂恿下，在会外私行和萨拉盖特的社会统一党与独立社会党发生联系，阴谋使右派退出社会党。据塔斯社称：其目的在建立一个介于社会党与萨拉盖特党之间的“第三党”。罗米塔集团不得不放弃其长期以来留在社会党内进行反左派活动的方针，乃是它在党内日益孤立的结果。据法新社估计：受罗米塔影响的社会党员最多不超过百分之九点五。
    另据法新社讯：海牙国际社会党大会因为对意大利社会党决定仍与共产党合作表示“失望”，已决定将该党“开除”。
