[Chahar News] In Fangying, Huailai County, and Beixinbao area, Yanqing County, fruit orchards are experiencing outbreaks of tent caterpillars (locally known as sticky worms or hairy worms). In addition to urgently dispatching a technical team carrying medicines and equipment to the area to assist the masses in actively eliminating the pests, the Chahar Provincial People's Government has issued an urgent notice to all areas (especially fruit tree areas) emphasizing the importance of pest control. It urges the mobilization of the masses to conduct thorough inspections in fields and gardens. Egg masses, worm pouches, and nests attached to fruit tree branches and rolled leaves should be cut off and burned with scissors. The old bark underlayers and cracks of fruit trees are also places where insect eggs and larvae hide, and the old bark must be scraped off and burned. For hatched larvae clustered on branches and trunks that have not yet dispersed, fire scorching or brushing with kerosene can be used to kill them. Spreading dry soil among the leaves also has some effect. Special vigilance must be maintained around the time of Lesser Fullness (小满, a solar term), and thorough control measures must be taken to prevent the spread.

[Chahar News] Pest infestations have occurred in Fangshan, Xingtang, Jingxing and other counties, and are now being actively combatted. Some villages in the Chengguan District and the Seventh District of Fangshan County are experiencing insect infestations where the insects are eating fruit tree leaves. The insects are elongated, green when small, and become hairy with white spots, changing from green to black as they grow. They also produce silk from their mouths. In Jingxing's Ninth District, sticky worms have appeared in the wheat fields south of Faluling Village, measuring six to seven fen in length, with white bellies and some with green backs and red heads. "Fire dragons" have occurred in the wheat fields of the Fourth and Fifth Districts. Locust nymphs have been found on the Beigang slope of Beiqiao Village, Xingtang County. The counties have now organized forces to capture and kill the pests. In Xingtang County, district cadres have organized more than 600 people to repeatedly capture and kill the locust nymphs three times. The 297 teachers and students of the Fifth Complete Primary School alone captured more than 27,900 locust nymphs in half a day. In Dongliushui Village, Chengguan, Fangshan County, utilizing the cool temperatures in the early morning and evening when the insects crawl to the base of the trees, they are burying them with soil or burning them with fire. Using this method, Wang Guowu's group caught more than seven sheng of insects in one day.

　　怀来房山等地积极扑灭虫害
    【察哈尔讯】怀来县房营，延庆县北辛堡一带，果树园发生梅毛虫（土名粘虫，或毛虫），察省人民政府除急派技术队携带药品器械前往该地协助群众积极除治外，特紧急通知名地（特别是果木地区）必须十分重视除灭虫害工作，发动群众深入田园进行检查，害虫的卵块、虫包、巢穴其附在果树枝梢及卷叶上者，可用剪刀剪下焚毁，果树之老皮下层及裂缝间也是虫卵和幼虫潜藏的地方，须将老皮刮去焚毁，已孵化之幼虫而聚于枝干尚未散开的可用火烧燎，或涂刷煤油以杀之。已散布于叶间的撒干土亦有部分效力。在小满节前后，尤须高度警惕，澈底除治，勿使蔓延。
    【察哈尔讯】房山、行唐、井陉等县发生虫害，现正进行捕打。房山城关区及七区有些村庄发生虫子，专吃果树叶，虫子为长形，小时绿色，长大后满身有毛，颜色由绿变黑，还有小白点，口中有丝。井陉九区乏驴岭村南麦地里发生粘虫，身长六七分，肚白色，有的绿背红头。四、五区麦子发生“火龙”。行唐北桥村北岗坡上发现蝗蝻。现各县已组织力量进行捕打。行唐县区干部已组织群众六百余人，连续反复捕打三次，只第五完小师生二百九十七人，半天就捕捉蝗蝻二万七千九百多个。房山城关东流水村利用每天早晚，天气较冷，虫子都爬在树根底下时，用土埋或用火烧。用这个办法王国五一组一天捉虫七升多。
