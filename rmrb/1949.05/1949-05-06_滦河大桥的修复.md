Located across the Luan River are two parallel large iron bridges, the famous Luan River Old Bridge and Luan River New Bridge. The Old Bridge was built by the British and has been in service for sixty years, long exceeding its lifespan and rendering it unusable. The New Bridge began construction in 1935 and was completed in 1937. When the Kuomintang bandit army retreated, they carried out a frenzied destruction, with the New Bridge being particularly heavily damaged. After we liberated the Beining Railway line, due to the urgency of restoring traffic, the No. 1 Detachment of the Railway Corps and workers from the Tangshan Engineering Section cooperated to quickly repair the Old Bridge, enabling it to barely handle traffic. However, trains could only travel at a speed of five kilometers per hour, wasting time and posing risks. Therefore, the urgent repair of the New Bridge became a priority. The New Bridge is 694 meters long, with 20 spans, double tracks, and a span distance of 13 meters. The Kuomintang bandit army destroyed six bridge piers, destroying every other one. In addition, seven piers in the middle section had cracks, and a total of twenty-four bridge girders fell into the river, causing extremely severe damage.

On February 1st, the No. 1 Detachment of the Railway Corps was ordered to arrive and immediately began preparations, further blasting and removing the damaged bridge piers; building pontoon bridges, and manufacturing and repairing tools. On March 7th, they received the formal construction order, with the task being to complete the project from March 24th, when concrete work began, to May 7th, a period of 45 days, and restore traffic. After discussions between the soldiers and staff, it was decided to strive for completion by "May Day". With the active efforts of the Railway Corps soldiers, the project was completed on April 30th, and a traffic opening ceremony was held on May 1st. This is a high-level demonstration of the power of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party.

The Luan River Railway Bridge is the largest iron bridge on the inland section of the Beining Railway. The repair project required a total of 36,343 workdays, saving more than 2,200 workdays. Originally designed as a double-track bridge, it was temporarily converted to a single-track bridge due to material and time constraints. Most of the soldiers lacked bridge-building skills, but through diligent learning, mutual assistance, and gaining experience on the job, everyone improved, and their ideology also broke the previous notion that "we cannot learn technology". Consequently, work efficiency increased day by day, and the project progressed faster and faster. When erecting the bridge girders, they could only erect one girder per day at the beginning, but eventually they could erect three or four. When building the first pier, it took 72 hours and 642 workdays, but the last one only took 33 hours and 307 workdays. When driving steel nails, one group initially only drove 60-70 per day, but later the highest was over 1,700 per group. In addition, many "old rules" were broken, and new methods were created. For example, when mixing concrete, contractors used to add 65% water, but research showed that this was not strong enough, so it was changed to 50-55% water, making the piers much stronger. There was only one bridge erecting machine, and it was on the opposite bank. Because it was too heavy, it could not be driven across the Old Bridge. However, if the bridge erecting machine wasn't used the only solution would have been to stack sleepers, which would waste labor, delay time, and waste wood. The soldiers came up with a method to disassemble the bridge erecting machine, transport it across, and then reassemble it. In just two days, the bridge was successfully erected. Another more important reason for the early completion of the project was the enthusiastic work attitude of the soldiers and workers. The weather on the Luan River was cold and sandy, and the river ice had not melted. Everyone worked shirtless on scaffolding more than ten meters high, carrying baskets of more than 100 pounds of concrete without regard for fatigue. Soldier Liu Guozhen was hit in the head by a stone but refused to rest. They had a slogan: "We are mixing concrete to fight Chiang Kai-shek with bayonets!" Units challenged units, and individuals challenged individuals to compete for merits and become models. They also challenged the bridge factory in Shanhaiguan: as long as the factory could deliver the girders by April 25th, they guaranteed that traffic would be restored by May 1st. As a result, both sides were victorious, and the grand opening ceremony of the Luan River Bridge was held on May Day.

    滦河大桥的修复
    横在滦河的上面有两座并排的大铁桥，这就是有名的滦河旧桥和滦河新桥。旧桥是英人修的，现在已有六十年寿命，早就超过有效期，不能使用。新桥民国二十四年开始修建，二十六年完成。国民党匪军溃退时进行了疯狂的破坏。新桥炸的尤重。当我们解放了北宁路沿线以后，因为急于通车，所以就先由铁纵一支队和唐山工务段的工友配合将旧桥抢修成功，勉强行车，但火车只能以每小时五公里的速度行驶，浪费时间还有危险，因此新桥的赶修就成为紧急任务。新桥共长六百九十四米，二十孔，双轨，桥间十三米。国民党匪军炸毁了六个桥墩，每隔一个毁一个，另有中部七个有裂纹，共有二十四个桥架掉到水里，破坏极为惨重。
    二月一日铁纵一支队奉命到达，立刻开始准备工作，将已被炸坏的桥墩再加爆破铲除；搭起浮桥，制造和修理工具。到三月七日接到正式施工命令，任务是从三月二十四日打洋灰起到五月七日四十五天通车，经过战士们和工作人员的讨论，决定争取“五一”通车。在铁纵战士们积极努力下四月三十日工程全部完成，五月一日举行了通车典礼。这是共产党领导下人民力量的高度集中表现。
    滦河铁桥是北宁路关内段最大的一个铁桥，修复的工程一共用了三万六千三百四十三个工，节约省二千二百余工。本来是双轨，因为材料和时间的关系，暂时改为单轨，战士们大部没有修桥技术，但是经过努力学习互相帮助，并在工作中吸收经验的结果，大家都提高了一步，同时在思想上也打破了以前认为“技术不是咱们学得会的”的观念因而工作效率逐日提高，工程进行一天比一天快。开始架桥梁的时候，一天只能起一个架一个，到最后就能起四个架三个；在做第一个桥墩的时候，用了七十二小时六百四十二个工，但最后一个只用三十三小时三百零七个工；打钢钉起初一组每天只打六七十个，到后来最高到每组打一千七百多个。此外还打破了许多“老规矩”，创造了新办法，如拌洋灰的时候，以前包工们总是掺百分之六十五的水分，经研究结果，这样不够坚固，改为掺百分之五十到五十五的水，这样桥墩就牢靠得多了。架桥机只有一个还在对岸，因为太重，不能由旧桥驶过，可是如不用架桥机，就只有用枕木堆叠的办法，费工耽误时间还要浪费木料，于是战士们想出办法，把架桥机拆了，分运过来再装上，只两天就顺利地把桥架上。工程提早完成另一个更重要的原因，就是战士和工友们的热烈工作情绪，滦河天冷风沙大，河冰未消，大家光着膀子在十多米高的架子上，不顾疲劳地挑着两筐一百多斤的洋灰飞跑。战士刘国桢被石头砸了头也不肯休息。他们有一个口号：我们打洋灰就是和蒋介石拼刺刀！他们单位与单位，个人与个人个挑战比赛，争取立功当模范，还向山海关的桥梁工厂提出挑战：只要工厂能将梁在四月二十五日前送来，他们保证在五月一日通车，结果双方都胜利了，滦河大桥于五一举行了盛大的落成典礼。
