I Await You, To Strive Together!
    ——Sent to My Beloved Fighting in the Fourth Field Army
    Wang Yiyin
    You left!
    Taking with you a strong love for the people,
    Taking with you a loyal passion for the revolution,
    I couldn't keep you,
    Didn't want to keep you.

    We argued,
    For the people's tomorrow.
    You had to go to the front line,
    I had to build in the rear,
    Neither of us would give way.
    You left,
    I stayed,
    Both must uphold our responsibilities.

    You left!
    Leaving me in conflict;
    I also want to go,
    Want to follow you,
    But that's cowardice, that's selfishness.

    You left!
    I miss you by my side,
    In the classroom,
    In the dining hall,
    I no longer see the eyes that watched me,
    I have never forgotten you for a moment,
    This longing—
    Is the driving force of my busy life.

    Tonight,
    I miss you even more,
    Wuhan is liberated,
    Glorious victory also includes a share of your merit,
    I am proud!
    I am excited!

    I seem to see:
    You vying to board the first boat across the river,
    You the first to cross the enemy's concentrated artillery fire on the ridge,
    You always striving to be the first,
    You can withstand the test,
    I will not misjudge you.

    Fight bravely,
    Return victoriously soon,
    More arduous work needs us,
    I await you
    To strive together!

　　我等待你，同努力！
    ——寄给我在第四野战军作战的爱人
    汪以引
    你走了！
    带着对人民强烈的爱，
    带着对革命忠实的热情，
    留不住你，
    不想留住你。
　
    我们争过的，
    为了人民的明天。
    你一定要走上前线，
    我一定要在后方建设，
    谁也不让谁。
    你走了，
    我留下来，
    都要坚持自己的责任。
　
    你走了！
    剩下我在矛盾；
    我也想去，
    想跟着你，
    但，这是懦怯，是自私。
　
    你走了！
    身旁少了你，
    课堂里，
    饭厅里，
    失去了关注我的眼睛，
    我不曾一刻忘记过你，
    这想念——
    是我紧张生活的动力。
　
    今夜，
    更想你，
    武汉解放了，
    光荣的胜利里也夹了一份你的功绩，
    我骄傲！
    我兴奋！
　
    我仿佛看见：
    你争坐渡江的第一只船，
    你第一个翻过敌人炮火集中的山岭，
    你永远勇往争先，
    你经得起考验，
    我不会错误估价你。
　
    勇敢地战斗，
    早胜利归来，
    更艰苦的工作需要我们，
    我等待你
    同努力！
