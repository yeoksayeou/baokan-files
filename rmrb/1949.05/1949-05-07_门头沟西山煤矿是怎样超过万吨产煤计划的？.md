How Did Mentougou Xishan Coal Mine Exceed the 10,000-Ton Coal Production Plan?
    The Constant Power Outages Troubled the Workers
    The Mentougou Xishan Coal Mine planned to produce 9,000 tons of coal in April. In order to welcome "May Day," all the mine workers decided to strive for 10,000 tons, so a production competition was launched. However, since April 1st, due to the impact of strong winds on the power lines of the Shijingshan Power Plant, there were seven power outages in the first ten days alone, totaling 34 hours and 35 minutes. As a result, only 2,586 tons were produced in the first ten days, nearly 800 tons less than planned. The workers frowned and were very distressed.
    "Snatch" Back 800 Tons of Coal!
    At this time, some workers called for carrying out the "Snatch Back 800 Tons of Coal Movement," and the workers' morale gradually increased, with production increasing day by day. Unfortunately, at this time, the transformer at the Shijingshan Power Plant's substation in Mentougou had another malfunction, resulting in eight power outages. As a result, although efforts were made to increase production, the mid-ten days produced 3,366 tons of coal, but still failed to make up for the 800-ton deficit. However, the workers did not give up. From the 20th onwards, everyone worked even harder, determined to complete 10,000 tons in the last ten days (including the production of the previous two ten-day periods). The workers repairing coal carts, operating coal cutters, firing boilers, mechanics, electricians, and blasting workers all stepped up their work to coordinate with the needs of underground coal production. By the 26th, a total of 8,168 tons had been produced. There were still four days until the end of the month, and 1,832 tons were still owed. At this time, some people said, "Producing more than 1,800 tons in four days means more than 460 tons a day, which is absolutely impossible." Some people said, "9,000 tons can still be managed." Some people said, "The highest record for our small team is only 144 tons." No one believed that 10,000 tons could be produced.
    The Underground Foreman Went Down the Well at Night
    On the night shift of the 27th, Qin Lianfang, the underground foreman, went down the well (he usually went down the well on the first shift). Like a commander, he directed the supervisors and team leaders. After a night of hard work, 282 carts, equivalent to 169 tons, were produced by the time the shift changed, breaking the previous record.
    This caused jubilation throughout the mine. On the first shift of the 28th, all the workers put forward the slogan: "We must surpass 282 carts!" On the morning of that day, the bell at the pithead kept ringing (originally, electric bells were used as signals for coal carts going up and down at the pithead. The bell was used only when there was a power outage; if the bell was used instead of the electric bell when there was electricity, it was a sign of challenge from the underground transportation workers to the surface transportation workers, because the sound of the bell could be clearly heard in every corner of the mine). As a result, this shift produced 293 carts, equivalent to 175.5 tons, surpassing yesterday's production again.
    As Long as There is Coal, We Will Produce 300 Carts!
    When the second shift arrived, the workers saw that not a single cart of coal was left at the bottom of the large and small shafts. In the eyes of the miners, this was a demonstration and challenge. The workers installing the cages in the underground transport team said, "As long as there is coal, we will definitely surpass the first shift and produce 300 carts! Don't worry, the pithead won't be delayed!" Hou Zhenwu, the electric pick operator in the 630-foot south alley, also said loudly, "Didn't they pick 60 hooks? As long as there is coal, I will pick 70 hooks." The workers directly mining coal guaranteed, "As long as you transport quickly, our coal will never delay the hooks." The scene of chatting and laughing while working was no longer seen. All that was heard was, "How much have you produced?" As a result, Hou Zhenwu really did pick 71 hooks. The workers directly mining coal, pushing carts, and loading cages did not delay each other. By the 10 p.m. shift, a total of 313 carts of coal were produced, equivalent to 187.8 tons, 12.3 tons more than the first shift. At this time, the mechanics and electricians were very busy: they rushed to the locations of various coal cutters to check the parts, fearing that the machines would break down.
    On the morning of the 29th, when the "Coal Production Daily Report" was sent to the office, the shout of "539.4 tons" made all the staff in the office jump for joy, and the news spread throughout the mine.
    Two or Three Hundred People Opened Their Eyes Wide, Watching Even More Amazing Results Appear.
    After 1:30 p.m. on the same day, two or three hundred people gathered at the large pithead and in front of the coal cutter rooms and boiler rooms around the large pit, all opening their eyes wide, watching the steel cables of the large coal cutters lift cart after cart from the well. They knew that this shift would have even more amazing results. Someone was counting: "Three hundred and one, three hundred and eleven...three hundred and fourteen," indeed, this shift surpassed yesterday's second shift. The workers in the boiler room also raised their hands high, looking at their watches and shouting, "Seven minutes left, six minutes left...one minute left, how much is it?" "Three hundred and twenty-eight! Time's up!" The whistle ended the production of this shift. The jubilation of the masses was indescribable. An old Xishan coal mine worker said, "Workers caring so much about production has never happened since the opening of the Xishan Mine." At this time, someone in the line of workers preparing to go down for the second shift shouted, "Let's produce 350!" But before the words were finished, there was another power outage. Fortunately, this power outage only lasted for three and a half hours, which did not affect the overall production.
    On the last day, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., 351 tons were produced in sixteen hours. Including the previous production, it was already 10,033 tons. People smiled and said, "Enough, the coal for the night shift is surplus." By the next morning, summarizing the coal production in April, a total of 10,199.4 tons was reached.
    There Were Twenty-Six Power Outages in April, Lasting Eighty-Nine Hours, But the Workers Finally Overcame Them.
    According to the statistics of the engineering office, there were twenty-six power outages, large and small, in April, totaling 89 hours and 45 minutes; but the strong will of the workers finally overcame this serious obstacle, not only reaching but also exceeding the plan of 10,000 tons of coal, dedicating this glorious achievement to "May Day."

### 门头沟西山煤矿是怎样超过万吨产煤计划的？

　　门头沟西山煤矿是怎样超过万吨产煤计划的？
    不断的停电苦恼着工人们
    门头沟西山煤矿四月份预定产煤九千吨，全矿职工为了迎接“五一”，决定争取产一万吨，于是展开生产大竞赛。但自四月一日以来，因石景山发电厂线路受大风的影响，光上一旬停电七次，总计达三十四小时三十五分，因此一旬只产了二千五百八十六吨，照预定量少产近八百吨。工人们都皱起了眉头，非常苦恼。
    要“抢”回八百吨煤！
    这时有一部分工人号召开展“抢回八百吨煤运动”，工人们的情绪又渐渐提高起来，产量一天一天的增加。不幸这时石景山电厂在门头沟的变电所的变压器又发生了障碍，停电八次，以致虽经努力增产，中旬产煤达到三千三百六十六吨，却仍未补起八百吨的数字，但职工们没有泄气，从廿日以后大家更加努力，决心在最后十天内要完成一万吨（连上两旬产量在内）。修理煤车的，开镐车的，烧锅炉的、机、电工们、卷火药的工人，都加紧工作，配和井下产煤的需要。到廿六日统计共产了八千一百六十八吨。距月终还有四天，而尚欠一千八百三十二吨。这时有人说：“四天要出一千八百多吨。一天要合四百六十吨，绝对出不到。”有人说，“九千吨还能凑合。”有人说：“我们一小班的最高纪录才一百四十四吨。”都不相信能出够一万吨。
    井下总管夜间下了井
    廿七日的夜班，井下总管秦连芳下井了（他平常是在第一班下井的）。象指挥员似的指挥各监工、各小组长。经一夜的努力，到换班时出了二百八十二车，合一百六十九吨，打破了以往的最高纪录。
    这一下引起了全矿的欢腾。二十八日的第一班，全体工人提出口号：“誓必赶过二百八十二车！”当日的一个上午，井口的大钟，当当当当不断的吼叫着（井口煤车上下原以电铃为信号。在停电时才使用大钟；如果有电时不用电铃而用大钟，则是井下运输工对井上运输工挑战的表示。因为大钟的声音能使全矿每一个角落全能清楚的听到）。结果这一班产了二百九十三车，合一七五·五吨，又超过了昨天的产量。
    只要有煤，出他三百车！
    等到第二班，工人一下井就看到了大井底、小井底一车存煤也未留。这在矿工们看来是一种示威挑战行动。井下运输组装罐笼的工人说：“只要有煤，绝对赶过第一班，出他三百车！放心，井口不误事！”六百三十英尺南巷的开电镐车工人侯振武也大声的说：“他们不是镐六十钩吗？只要有煤，俺镐他七十钩。”直接采煤的工人保证说：“只要你们运输快，我们的煤决不误钩”。往天一边干活，一边说笑的情形看不见了，所听到的只是“你们出多少了？”结果，侯振武真的就镐了七十一钩。直接采煤的、推车的、装罐笼的，谁也未误谁的事。到夜十点班，共产煤三百一十三车，合一八七·八吨，比第一班多出了十二吨三。这时忙坏了机工与电工们：他们忙着往各镐车的处所跑，检查机件，惟恐怕机器出了毛病。
    二十九日清晨，当“产煤日报表”送到办公室时，“五百三十九吨四”的喊声使办公室的全体人员都欢跃起来，消息马上传遍了全矿。
    二三百人睁大了眼睛，看着更惊人的成绩出现。
    当日下午一时半以后，大井口上与大井周围的镐车房、锅炉房门前围了二三百人，都睁大了眼睛，看着大镐车的钢丝绳一车一车从井下提上来。他们知道这一班会有更惊人的成绩出现。有人在数着：“三百一，三百一十一……三百一十四，”真的，这一班又超过昨天二班去了。锅炉房的工人也高扬着手，看着手表在嚷：“还差七分、六分……差一分，多少啦？”“三百二十八！到点了！”喔——的一声汽笛结束了这一个班的产量。群众欢腾情形，是难以形容的。一位老西山煤矿工人说：“工人这样关心产量，自西山矿开办以来没有过。”这时，准备下井的第二班，工人行里又有人喊出：“咱们出他三百五！”可是话还没有说完，突然又停电了，好在这次停电只三时半，未影响大的产量。
    最后一日从上午六时至下午十时十六小时内，就产了三百五十一吨。连前所产已是一万零三十三吨了。人们都笑着说：“够了，夜班的煤是富余了”。到次晨总结四月份产煤，共计达一万零一百九十九吨四。
    　　　　四月份停电二十六次停了八十九小时但工人们终于战胜。
    据工程师室统计，四月份大小停电二十六次，计八十九小时四十五分；但职工们的坚强意志终于战胜了这个严重障碍，不仅达到，并且超过了一万吨煤的计划，以此辉煌的战绩献给了“五一”。
