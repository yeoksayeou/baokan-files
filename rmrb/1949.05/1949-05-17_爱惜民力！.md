Three Words and Two Phrases

　　Cherish the people's strength!
    The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region have long issued clear orders strictly prohibiting illegal mobilization. However, in Xiong County, Baxin County, and Xincheng County in central Hebei, there have been serious waste and illegal mobilization, increasing the burden on the masses' labor and animal power, and hindering the masses' spring plowing production. This is unacceptable. The main reason is that the leaders of these three counties usually do not study policies and regulations carefully, and their concept of the masses is extremely vague; at the same time, they neglect leadership in war support work and lack scientific calculation and management. This is a serious bureaucratic work style, which should arouse the vigilance of governments and organizations at all levels, as well as every cadre. We should conduct in-depth inspections to instill the ideas of cherishing the people's strength, practicing thrift, opposing waste, and strictly prohibiting illegal mobilization into all our work. In this incident, although the Hebei Central Tenth District People's Armed Forces Department has made a review and correction, the losses suffered by the masses should be appropriately compensated. The organs that wasted the people's strength should apologize to the migrant workers to improve the morale of the masses and benefit production.

　　爱惜民力！
    爱惜民力，严禁非法动员，华北人民政府及华北军区早有明令规定。冀中雄霸新城等县却发生了严重浪费和非法动员，加重群众人力畜力负担，妨碍群众春耕生产的现象，这是不应该的。其主要原因，是该三县领导方面，平日对政策法令不加研究，群众观念极端模糊；而对战勤工作忽视领导，缺乏科学计算管理。这是严重的官僚主义作风，值得引起各级政府各个机关及每一个干部的警惕，深入进行检查，把爱惜民力，厉行节约，反对浪费，严禁非法动员的思想，贯注到一切工作中去。此次事件，冀中十分区人民武装部虽然作了检讨纠正，但群众所受的损失，应进行适当的赔偿，浪费民力的机关，应向民工道歉，以提高群众情绪而利生产。
