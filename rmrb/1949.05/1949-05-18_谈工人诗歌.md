　　Talking about Workers' Poetry
　　Sha Ou

　　I.

　　Workers, eager to express their thoughts and feelings and convey the joy of liberation, have enthusiastically started writing poetry and clapper rhymes. Although these works may appear somewhat rough and simple, they are robust, like thriving and sturdy young seedlings with a bright future—a point that no one should overlook.

　　In their works, they actively grasp the solemn theme of developing production. Our Party's urgent task in the liberated cities is precisely how to develop production, a burden mainly shouldered by the working class. Tomorrow's prosperity and affluence will be guaranteed by their hard work and efforts. Every factory is swept up in a production competition, a hallmark of a new era and a new society. In this fervent production surge, workers have not only a deep sense of being masters of their own destiny but also confidence in creating a new society. The songs they sing during this tireless labor naturally express a clear, strong, excited, and joyful enthusiasm for production. This has been demonstrated in recent workers' works.

　　Hang up the challenge,
　　Start mass production together,
　　The forging plan is well made,
　　Completing it step by step ahead of schedule.

　　The foundry starts the furnace,
　　The windmill blows fire with a whooshing sound,
　　Wooden molds are made at night,
　　Guaranteeing completion without delay.

　　The machinists are busy,
　　Holding meetings after work to discuss urgently,
　　Scrubbing and planing in a hurry,
　　Working through the night without rest.

　　The fitters accept the challenge with laughter,
　　Guaranteeing quality better than before.
　　Sweat flows, work gets done,
　　Complete the task, then do the Yangko dance.
　　—Tian Yuan, "Competition"

　　This is a rhythm that makes one breathless to read aloud, a unique melody of the working class in the joy of labor, powerfully expressing that the development of production is like a surging wave. It contains tense scenes, loud voices, the completion of one glorious task after another, a new majestic force, and a picture of the unlimited development of the productive forces of the emancipated working class.

　　Workers celebrating liberation cannot help but think of the painful past. Therefore, their works deeply and solemnly denounce the past. In the era under the demonic hands of Chiang Kai-shek, workers lived in misery. Now that they are liberated, it is natural to denounce the past. Before the Chinese Communist Party, as kind as a mother, and under the Party's warm care, everyone wants to speak out and complain. Two worlds are clearly separated before them. Pain and happiness are so clear and distinct. How can the hearts of the working brothers not surge with emotion in the great transformation of thousands of years of history? How can they not pour out the bitterness of the past?

　　Heavy snow falls down,
　　The ground is muddy and slippery,
　　Braving the snow to go to work,
　　Not afraid of the cold, spirits are high;
　　The Communist Party is the workers' party,
　　If not working hard today, when?
　　—Zhang Xiaozhong from Changxindian, "Awakened"

　　Although the working brothers mainly focus on production in today's poetry, the poems published in the newspapers generally have not deviated from this theme. This shows that class hatred cannot be forgotten, a most sincere expression of the emotions of the Chinese workers. Thinking of the past suffering and remembering today's joy, the hatred of the past strengthens the love of today. This love is specifically expressed in Comrade Zhang Xiaozhong's phrases "spirits are high" and "If not working hard today, when?"

　　II.

　　Speaking of the forms of workers' poetry, they are diverse from the beginning. Among them, the form of clapper rhymes is more common, but it is definitely not limited to clapper rhymes. The forms we see now can be roughly divided into three types: one is like "Turning Over Song," "Awakened," and Comrade Li Yitian's (Shijingshan Power Plant) "Power Plant Workers' Song," and Comrade Xia Baoyi's (Shijingshan Power Plant) "Power Plant Song." These are arranged neatly, with end rhymes, and the number of characters in each line is also limited. This can be said to be the "clapper rhyme form." This form did not originally belong to the workers and was probably imitated. The second is free verse, such as Comrade Hu Weixin's "A Worker's Words," Comrade Li Zhongzhen's (Yangquan Yarn Factory) "The Sun Shines into Everyone's Home," and Comrade Li Lanting's (Shijingshan Power Plant) "To Chairman Mao." The beginning section of this poem is like this:

　　Hearing that you are coming,
　　We raise our hands high,
　　Like mutes,
　　So happy that we can't say a word.

　　This form is very free, without any restrictions or constraints, and generally does not force end rhymes. It is somewhat like the general form of new poetry that we are familiar with. The third is relatively neat, yet not rigid, with a relatively lively rhythm, not belonging to the clapper rhyme category, nor to the free verse form, and not folk songs. Comrade Zhu Guifang's, a fifteen-year-old female worker, "Yarn Factory Women Workers' Song" best represents this form. It can be sung, is pleasing to the ear, does not have a strict limit on the number of characters per line, and each stanza does not necessarily have to be four lines, but it is relatively neat. This is a better form. Comrade Li Boxun's (Pingjin Railway) "Rushing to Build the Transportation Road," and Comrades Jing Zhuang and Chun Jiao's (Xishan Coal Mine) "Coal Mining" all belong to this type.

　　The adoption of diverse forms makes us believe that workers' poetry is not "stereotyped," which must be emphasized. Of course, it is too early to say that they have created any new forms based on their existing achievements. But today, because it is not "stereotyped," it shows that they want to create forms that can accurately express their thoughts, and there are more possibilities. In the creative process, they will appropriately absorb and discard on the existing foundation. We look at today and also look at tomorrow. To talk about new forms away from the current foundation is empty talk.

　　Let's look at the poem "Coal Mining":

　　You swing the hammer, I hold the drill,
　　Ding—dang, ding—dang,
　　Drilling into the mine, hammer blow by hammer,
　　Hold the drill steady, strike the hammer accurately,
　　Not afraid of the coal seam being hard.

　　Load the explosives, light the fuse,
　　Boom, bang, whirr...
　　The mine tunnel is full of smoke.

　　Basket after basket we carry to the top,
　　Huff, purr, purr...
　　Push it down to the hook.

　　The electric bell rings,
　　The mine cart rolls,
　　Unhooking and hooking without delay,
　　Loading into the cage is even faster,
　　One shift produces two hundred and forty baskets!

　　From this poem, we not only feel the thoughts and feelings of the working class, but in terms of technique, the author integrates the various sounds of coal mining into the language of the poem. This rhythm of labor can only be achieved when the working class creates. The author's use of words is also appropriate. These workers' poems are developing rapidly, and they have begun to flash a new style.

　　III.

　　Does this mean that today's workers' poetry is already perfect? That is not the case. There are still some problems.

　　Clapper rhymes are more commonly used to express the thoughts and feelings of the workers. But sometimes, it also limits the content to a certain extent, significantly hindering the improvement of the existing level of workers' poetry. Because the relatively rigid form of seven characters per line must be broken through. No one stipulates that we must write seven or five characters per line when creating. If seven characters per line happen to explain the meaning well, there is no need to avoid seven characters. If using seven characters is not enough or too much, we should write more or fewer characters freely. Rhyming is also the same. There is no need to rhyme every line. Rhyming every few lines is fine, and rhyming with approximately the same rhyme is also acceptable, because the purpose of rhyming is only to be easy to remember, easy to sing, and pleasing to the ear. If the above purpose can be achieved, rhyming more lively and vividly will only benefit the poem and will not harm it. This is a point that cannot be ignored in today's workers' poetry.

　　Therefore, comrades working on their creations can boldly break through this limitation. Like fighting a battle, we must vigorously strive for initiative and flexibility in creation. New forms are established from initiative and flexibility.

　　Regarding the language issue, workers' poems use a lot of their own language, which is worth advocating and should be used more. In today's works, there are also many political slogans used in some poems, especially in the last few lines of some poems, where they always enthusiastically shout a few slogans. This has a good side and a not-so-good side. If one poet uses a political slogan in a poem, it is fresh and beautiful. If you use it and I use it, and it is used too much, it will appear not very fresh. This requires us to use more thought and express real emotions through specific things. For example, take "developing production." How exactly is production being developed? Textile factories, power plants, and steel plants all have their own specific situations and specific tasks. Therefore, when expressed in poems, although the sound is equally majestic and resolute, the rhythm will not be exactly the same. There should be some differences, writing out these differences, so that people understand exactly how production is being developed, is it not more powerful and more moving than shouting "develop production?" Poetry requires such a voice. This is precisely the workers' own voice. This is the voice from the workshop, by the boiler, and on the anvil. Recording such a voice in language is relatively difficult, but many workers' poems have already made such a record.

　　Using the language that one is familiar with in life and constantly created by one's life to replace those more slogan-like words will make new works shine more brightly. Using subjects that one has experienced or are most clear about to replace the idea of writing about the entire factory in a short poem, because this is a thankless task. The factory is large, with many departments, and the lives and emotions of comrades are expanding in the close combination of the production surge and the Communist Party. Trying to describe all of it in dozens of lines of poetry makes it difficult to give people a sense of being on the scene. It easily becomes simple and conceptual, easily makes the poet's emotions unable to integrate, and appears weak and dry.

　　These existing problems are gradually being overcome and improved. Today, workers' poetry demonstrates a beautiful and magnificent vision. More workers' poems will emerge, and a new page has been turned in the history of Chinese poetry. Let us raise our hands and welcome the vanguard of workers' poetry, the new army of workers' poetry!

　　谈工人诗歌
    沙鸥
    一
    工人们要抒发自己的思想、情感，要传达解放后的欢愉，都热烈地写起诗歌、快板来。这些作品虽然显得粗糙些，朴实些；但是茁壮的，是青青向荣的结实的幼苗，是有光明的前途的，这一点谁也不容许忽视。
    在他们的作品中，积极地掌握了发展生产这一庄严的主题。我党在解放的大城市中的紧迫的任务正是如何发展生产，这个担子主要地是靠工人阶级来承担，明天的繁荣与富足将被他们的辛勤与努力得到保证。每一个工厂都卷起了生产竞赛，这是一个新时代新社会的标帜。工人在这种热狂的生产突击中，不仅仅有着当了主人翁的深沉的感动，更有着创造新社会的信心。他们在这种日夜不息的劳作中所发出来的歌声，自然是明快、强烈、激动、欢愉的生产热情。这在近来的工人作品中已得到了说明。
    挂出挑战书，
    一齐大生产，
    锻工计划做得好，
    一步一步早做完。
    翻砂开了炉，
    风车吹火呜呜呜，
    木型加夜做，
    保证完成不耽误。
    车工忙又忙，
    下班开会急商量，
    洗刨着了急，
    连夜赶活不休息。
    钳工应战哈哈笑，
    保证质量要比从前好。
    流下汗，干下活，
    完成任务再扭秧歌。
  　田元“竞赛”。
    这是一种朗读起来使人有点难于喘气的紧迫的节奏，这种为工人阶级在劳动的欢喜中所独有的弦律，有力地表达了发展生产是如大浪汹涌。这里面有紧张的场景，有高扬的声音，是一个接着一个的光辉任务的完成，是一种新的雄伟的力，是翻了身的工人阶级的生产力无限制地发展的一幅图画。
    欢庆解放的工人同志，又不能不想到痛苦的过去，因此在他们的作品中，深切地沉重地控诉了过去，在蒋贼魔手下的时代，工人们是在苦难中过着日子，现在解放了，很自然地要控诉过去的。在亲娘一样的中国共产党的面前，在共产党的亲切的照顾下，谁也要说说诉诉。两个世界在面前截然分开，痛苦与幸福是这样的清楚明白，几千年的历史的大转变，工人弟兄的心中怎能没有涌动，怎能不把过去的苦水向外吐诉？
    大雪纷纷往下飘，
    地上泥滑走步摇，
    踏雪上班去工作，
    不怕寒冷情绪高；
    共产党本是工人党，
    今天不干等那朝？
  　——长辛店张晓忠“觉悟了”
    工人弟兄在今天的诗歌作品中，虽然把主要的注意投向了生产，但发表在报上的诗作，一般地还有些没有离开这个主题，这是说明阶级的仇恨忘怀不了，这是一种最真诚的中国工人的情感的表现，想着过去的苦，记着今天的欢乐，对过去的恨是加强对今天的爱，这爱是具体表现在张晓忠同志的“情绪高”及“今天不干等那朝”的诗句里面。
　　二
    谈到工人诗作的形式，一开始就是多样的。其中，快板的形式是比较的多一些，但决不完全是快板。现在看见的形式，大约可分为三种：一种是如“翻身曲”、“觉悟了”以及李宜田同志（石景山电厂）的“电厂工人歌”、夏宝义同志（石景山电厂）的“发电厂歌”等这样的作品。这些排列很整齐，有脚韵，每行的字数也有一定的限制，这可说是“快板形”。这种形式原不属工人所有，大概是摹仿而来。一种是自由体，如胡维新同志的“一个工人的话”，李忠贞同志（阳泉纱厂）的“太阳照进众人家”，李兰亭同志（石景山电厂）的“给毛主席”，这诗的开头一节就是这样：
    听说你来了，
    我们高高地举起手来，
    象哑吧一样，
    高兴得说不出一句话。
    这种形式很自由，没有什么限制约束，一般的也不生硬的去押脚韵，有些象我们所熟悉的一般的新诗的形式。一种是较整齐，又不死板，音节又较明快，既不属于快板类，又不属于自由体的形式，又不是民歌，这种形式的作品当以十五岁的女工朱桂芳同志的“纱厂女工歌”为代表，又能唱、又动听，每句没有严格的字数限制，每节又非一定是四句不成，但又较整齐，这是一种较好的形式。李伯勋同志（平津路）的“赶筑交通大道”，景桩、春蛟同志（西山煤矿）的“采煤”都属于这一种类型。
    多样的形式被采用，使我们认为工人诗歌并非“千篇一律”，这是必须强调的。当然，在现有的成绩来说他们已创造了什么新形式还嫌过早，但今天由于并非“千篇一律”，说明了他们要创造恰能表达他们心意的形式，有了更多的可能。在创作过程中，他们将会在现有的基础上适当地吸取，适当地抛弃，我们看今天，还要从今天看明天，离开了现在的基础，去奢言什么新形式，那是空谈。
    我们来看“采煤”这一首诗吧：
    你打锤，我把钎，
    叮—当，叮—当，
    一锤一锤往里钻，
    钎把稳，锤打准，
    那怕煤壁坚又硬。
    装火药，点引线，
    轰，当，哗啦……
    满洞尽是烟。
    一筐一筐背人罐，
    呼，噜，噜，噜……
    推到下把钩。
    当当电铃响，
    镐车滚滚转，
    摘钩挂钩不迟延，
    装罐笼更不慢，
    一班出他二百四十罐！
    从这首诗里，不仅使我们感触到工人阶级的思想感情；在技巧上作者是把采煤时的各种声音融合在诗的语言里，这种劳动的节奏跳动，只有工人阶级在创作时才可能作到。作者在用字上也恰合其份，这些工人的诗歌，正一日千里地在向前发展，它已经开始在闪现一种新的风格。
　　三
    是不是说今天的工人诗歌就已经很完美了呢？那也不是的，其中还有些问题存在着。
    快板，是较一般地被用来表达工人的思想、情感。但有时，它也在一定程度上限制了内容，相当地阻碍着现有的工人诗歌水平的提高。因为比较刻板的七个字一句的形式必须突破。没有人规定我们在创作时非七个字或五个字一句不可，七个字一句恰好说明要说的意思时，也不必一定不要七个字，如用七个字嫌不够或嫌过多时，是应该多写几个字或少写几个字，可以自由些，也应该自由些。押脚韵也是如此，不必每一句都押，间隔几句押一押可以，押大致相同的韵也可以，因为押韵的目的不外是易记，易唱，动听而已。如上述目的可达，押得活泼些，押得生动些，对诗只有好处不会有害处。这是今天的工人诗歌中不容忽视的一点。
    因此工人同志在创作时，可以大胆地突破这个限制，象我们作战一样，要在创作时有力地争取主动与灵活，新形式是从主动与灵活中建立起来的。
    关于语言问题，工人的诗作中，是运用了不少的属于他们自己的语言，这还值得提倡，还应该多用。在今天的作品中，也还有好些政治口号被用进一些诗篇里，尤其是在一些诗的最后几句，总要热情地呼喊几句，这有好的一面，也有不十分好的一面。一篇诗里一个诗人用了一个政治口号，是新鲜的美好的，你也用我也用，用得太多了，就显得不十分新鲜了。这就要求我们多用思想，通过具体事物表达真实的情感。比如说“发展生产”吧，究竟是怎样发展生产呢？纺织厂、电厂、钢铁厂，各有各的具体情况，具体任务。因此，表现在诗中，声音虽然是一样的雄壮坚决，但节奏也不会是完全一样的，应该有所区别，写出这种区别，使人了解究竟在如何发展生产，不是比大喊一声“发展生产”来得更有力，来得更感动人么？诗，正是要求这样的声音，这正是工人们自己的声音，这正是车间、锅炉旁、铁砧上发出来的声音，用语言记录这样的声音是比较要困难些，但已有不少的工人诗歌作了这种记录了。
    用自己在生活中熟悉的，用自己的生活所不断创造出来的语言来代替那些比较是属于口号一类的话，会使新的作品更强烈地发出光彩，用自己经历过的或最清楚的题材，来代替想在一首短诗中，把全个工厂都写得干干净净的想头，因为这是费力不讨好的事情，工厂大，部门多，同志们的生活及情绪都在突击生产与共产党的紧密结合中扩展，想用几十行诗来描写其全部，很难给人一种有如亲临其境的实感，很容易变得单纯与概念，很容易使诗人的感情融不进去，而显得瘦弱与干枯。
    这些存在的问题，已在逐步地克服、改进着。今天工人诗歌说明了一个美丽壮大的远景，更多的工人诗作要涌现，中国的诗歌史上已翻开了一个新页。举起手来迎接吧！工人诗歌的前哨部队，工人诗歌的新军！
