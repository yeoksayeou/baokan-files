Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 15th: All fifty universities and middle schools, and over one hundred and fifty primary schools in Hangzhou are continuing classes as usual. School equipment has been kept intact due to the protection of students, staff, and janitors. Many middle schools and higher level schools jointly established organizations to protect the schools before the Kuomintang bandit gangs fled. Zhejiang University, the Art Academy, and other schools prepared ample food, oil, salt, and vegetables, and kept their doors tightly shut before the People's Liberation Army arrived. They persisted in studying and kept up patrols and watch duties. The Zhejiang Provincial Library and the Zhejiang Provincial West Lake Museum are also open as usual. The books and valuable antiques in both museums were undamaged. The library has extremely valuable original handwritten copies and woodblock editions of the "Siku Quanshu" (Complete Library in Four Sections). The "Siku Quanshu" is a monumental work among Chinese old cultural books, and only three original handwritten copies exist in the entire country.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 17th: "Learn from the Liberation Army soldiers!" This is the slogan put forward by students from major universities and middle schools in Hangzhou after visiting the stationed troops. In order to understand why this people's army can win every battle, has strict discipline, and steel-like unity, students from Zhejiang University, the National Art Academy, Hangzhou High School, and other schools first visited the People's Liberation Army stationed in the urban area. The soldiers warmly welcomed the visitors, and the two sides immediately began to chat intimately. The soldiers used their own personal experiences to answer in detail the students' questions about combat, study, production, political work, democratic life, and other aspects, which aroused great interest among the students. Female students from the Art Academy especially brought needles and thread to sew and mend clothes for the soldiers. When they encountered someone they were visiting doing laundry, the students would rush to do it for them so that they could talk properly. Students who could draw made quick sketches of the soldiers. Whenever the conversation went on for too long and they needed a break, they would sing and do the Yangge dance with the soldiers, creating a joyful atmosphere. The Liberation Army's hard-working and simple life, sincere and frank attitude, and especially their high degree of political awareness, all left a deep impression on the visiting students. One student from the Art Academy said with emotion, "Talking to the comrades of the Liberation Army for half a day is better than reading books for several years."

　　杭州大中小学全部照常开课
  　要向解放军学习
    【新华社杭州十五日电】杭州全市五十所大学中学及一百五十余所小学，现仍照常开课。学校设备因学生及职员、校役保护，均告完整。许多中级以上学校在国民党匪帮逃窜前曾联合成立了护校的组织。浙大、艺专等校并准备了充足的粮食、油盐、蔬菜，在解放军未到前紧关校门，一面坚持学习，一面巡逻值班。浙江省立图书馆及浙江省立西湖博物馆现亦照常开放。两馆中的图书与名贵古物均无损毁。图书馆中有极名贵的四库全书原抄本及善本书木板本。四库全书为中国旧文化册籍中的巨著，原抄本全国现仅存有三部。
    【新华社杭州十七日电】“向解放军战士学习！”这是杭州市各大中学校学生们于访问驻军以后所提出的口号。为了了解这支人民军队为什么能够百战百胜，纪律严明，和钢铁般的团结，浙江大学、国立艺专、杭州高中等校学生们首先向驻防市区的解放军进行了访问。战士们对来访者报以热烈的欢迎，双方立刻亲热地交谈起来。战士们以自己亲身的经历详细地回答着学生们提出有关作战、学习、生产、政治工作、民主生活等方面的问题，引起学生们极大的兴趣。艺专的女同学特别带着针线，替战士们缝补衣服。碰到被访问者正在洗衣服时，同学们就抢着代洗，好让他们好好谈话。会画的学生则为战士们速写画像。每每当谈话过久需要休息时，他们便和战士们一起唱歌和扭秧歌，乐成一团。解放军的艰苦朴素的生活、诚恳坦白的态度，特别是高度的政治觉悟，都给访问同学以深刻的印象。艺专一个同学感动地说：“和解放军的同志说半天话，胜过读好几年书。”
