The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a statement protesting the Indian reactionary government's persecution of democrats and trade union personnel. The original text is as follows: From news dispatches from Delhi, we have learned that the Indian government is carrying out cruel persecution and massacre of Indian trade union leaders, communists, and democrats in Jamshedpur, Mumbai, Delhi, and other places. We express our utmost indignation at this brutal behavior and lodge a serious protest. We believe that this brutal behavior of the Indian reactionary government is a direct violation of the interests of the Indian people in obtaining genuine independence, democracy, and freedom, and is intolerable to anyone who loves democracy and freedom, and is a crime that will not be forgiven by the working people of the world, and will inevitably be met with more fierce resistance from the entire Indian people. Here, we extend our deep condolences and sympathy to all the working-class brothers and democrats in India who have been massacred and persecuted. We believe that your actions to strive for democracy and freedom, with the firm support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely win a glorious victory throughout India rapidly.
