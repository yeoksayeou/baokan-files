Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th. Under the policy of prioritizing the restoration of important industries and those with the conditions for restoration and development, and focusing on heavy industry, Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua are rapidly restoring and developing industrial production. In a certain iron mine in Xuanhua, the number of workers had increased to over 800 by the end of April, more than three times the number during the Kuomintang rule. The mine's machine factory has increased from two lathes to more than twenty various types of lathes. The Baoxing Coal Mine, a joint public-private venture in the Jimingshan Coal Mine area, and numerous private small mines, now produce 700-800 tons of coal per day, which, in addition to supplying the needs of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, can also be sold elsewhere. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant is the main source of electricity for industrial production in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. Within a dozen days of liberation, the plant's employees repaired a 10,000-kilowatt generator that had been partially damaged, completing the task of transmitting electricity.

Zhangjiakou is the main distribution center for grain in the Chahar-Suiyuan grain-producing area, and the grain and flour industry is one of the city's main industries. Currently, the city has nearly 30 public and private electric flour mills, operating 64 electric mills, producing more than 90,000 jin of flour per day, more than twice the highest output during the Kuomintang rule, and reaching the production level of the first liberation in the autumn of 1945. Due to the smooth flow of grain supply, the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory and Brewery have also developed. The Vegetable Oil Factory broke the record of producing over 3,000 jin per day in April, with a peak output of 4,550 jin per day. Since liberation, the daily output of the Zhangyuan Brewery has increased by about 50%. The Xuanhua Paper Mill and Cigarette Factory are the largest light industrial enterprises in the Chahar-Suiyuan area. The machinery has now been repaired and will soon be officially put into operation. In addition, among the light industries in Zhangjiakou that have resumed operation are lumber, rubber, food, and glassware factories. The Xuanhua Oxygen Plant, after exploration and research, overcame all difficulties and also started operation at the end of last month.

    张宣两市工业发展
    宣化某铁矿工人增加三倍  张市电磨面粉日产九万斤
    【新华社华北六日电】张家口及宣化市在先恢复重要和有条件恢复与发展者及以重工业为重点的方针下，迅速恢复与发展工业生产。宣化某地铁矿，至四月底工人已增至八百余人，超过国民党统治时三倍；该矿机器厂已由两部元车增为二十多部各式车床。鸡鸣山煤矿区公私合营的宝兴煤矿及不少私营小矿，现日产煤七、八百吨，除供给张、宣两市需用外，尚可外销。下花园发电厂为张、宣两市工业生产的主要电源。该厂于解放后十数日内，员工们即将被部分破坏的一万基罗瓦特发电机修好，完成送电任务。
    张家口为察北产粮区的粮食主要集散地，粮面业为该市主要行业之一。现该市共有公私电磨面粉业近三十家，开动电磨六十四座，日产面粉九万余斤，超过国民党统治时最高产量两倍，达到一九四五年秋季第一次解放时的生产水平。由于粮源畅顺，张垣植物油厂和酿造厂亦有发展。植物油厂四月份突破日产三千余斤的纪录，最高时产量日达四千五百五十斤。张垣酿造厂解放以来日产量提高约百分之五十。宣化造纸厂和卷烟厂是察绥一带规模最大的轻工业，现机器已修建完毕，即可正式开工。此外，张市轻工业中已复工者尚有制材、橡胶、食品、料器等工厂。宣化氧气厂经摸索钻研，克服一切困难，亦已于上月底开工。
