　　【Taihang Telegram】The postal and telecommunications services in Anyang City resumed operations on the day after the city's liberation (the 7th), immediately opening postal services to all liberated areas. This included handling ordinary mail, registered mail, parcels, and remittances. A postal office was established in the west gate of the city to facilitate postal services for all sectors. Telephone personnel are actively repairing telephone lines damaged by the war and erecting temporary power lines. The telephone lines for various city government offices have already been connected. Military long-distance telephone lines were also quickly erected after entering the city. In addition to connecting calls with the west and south of the city, efforts are being made to extend the lines to the east and south. The telegraph bureau's machines were well-preserved thanks to the active protection of the original staff. They are currently working to establish contact with various locations.
