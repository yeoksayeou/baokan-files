Mobilizing rural women to participate in agricultural production is an important condition for ensuring increased production this year and the correct path for the complete liberation of rural women. It is entirely correct that areas like Jinnan and Taihang plan to mobilize more than 50% of women to participate in agricultural production this year, because only by enabling the vast female labor force, which accounts for half the population, to participate in field labor can the difficulties of labor shortages be solved, and processing, fertilization, and increased yields can be achieved.

Currently, in the work of mobilizing women, some areas have begun to implement the policy of "the entire party doing women's work." For example, Linxian, Pingshun, and Cixian in the Taihang District, Pingxiang in the Jinnan District, and Huolu in Chahar Province have all convened county and district cadre meetings. The county party committees took the lead in guiding cadres to deeply examine the remnants of feudal ideas that belittled women. Many cadres realized that, in the past, due to a lack of concern for women's suffering, many women were still shackled and unable to fully unleash their labor enthusiasm. After such self-examination and ideological clarification by cadres and party members at the county, district, and village levels, they understood the importance of mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production and began to value women's work, changing the past phenomenon where only women's federation cadres did women's work, or even women's federation cadres did very little. Therefore, the mobilization of women to participate in agricultural production has achieved significant results and valuable experiences. First, attention has been paid to implementing the policy of harmonious families and united production, criticizing the isolated practice of working solely for the organization of women's associations, and deepening the work of mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production among the broad masses of farmers and into families, so that women can improve their status through active labor while also implementing the education of family democracy. As a result of this work, new-style families like Li Shunda's, which unite in production, have emerged in various places. Women actively participate in field production in harmonious families, demonstrating astonishing labor efficiency, which greatly enhances the status of women and the prestige of women's associations. This opposes the erroneous view of disregarding women's suffering and failing to guarantee women's rights, while also avoiding the tendency to create family opposition and affect united production.

Second, the old approach of simply talking about "equality between men and women" has been abandoned. Instead, local models of women's production achievements and roles are identified, and the importance of mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production and the principle of equality between men and women are understood through mutual persuasion among the masses themselves. This enables everyone to wholeheartedly criticize the erroneous ideas of belittling women and women belittling labor, creating a public opinion that laboring women are the most glorious, and encouraging most women to actively engage in field production. In Huguan Sixth District of Taihang, this experience was used to mobilize women to participate in spring ploughing and sowing, reaching 80% of the women in the entire village.

Currently, many areas are not doing enough to mobilize women. We should be good at using these experiences to actively liberate the labor force of rural women from the shackles of feudal customs, making them a large labor army on the agricultural production front and enabling them to play a great role in achieving this year's production increase tasks.

　　发动农村妇女参加农业生产
    发动广大农村妇女参加农业生产，是保证今年增加生产的重要条件，是农村妇女走向彻底解放的正确道路。冀南、太行等地区计划今年发动百分之五十以上的妇女参加农业生产是十分正确的，因为只有使占人口一半的广大妇女劳力，参加了田间劳动，才有可能解决劳力缺乏的困难，才有可能达到加工加肥增加产量。
    目前发动妇女的工作，有些地区开始贯彻了“全党做妇女工作”的方针，如太行区林县、平顺、磁县、冀南区平乡，察哈尔省获鹿等地都召开了县区干部会议，县委以身做则启发干部深刻检查了轻视妇女的封建思想残余，许多干部认识到：由于过去不关心妇女痛苦，结果使许多妇女仍被束缚着不能充分发挥其劳动热情。在县区村各级干部和支部党员如此检查打通思想之后，体会到了发动妇女参加农业生产的重要，开始重视了妇女工作，转变了过去只妇联干部做妇女工作，甚至妇联干部也很少做妇女工作的现象，因此使发动妇女参加农业生产获得了显著的成绩和值得学习的经验。首先是注意施行了和睦家庭团结生产的方针，批判了孤立的单纯为组织妇会而工作的做法，将发动妇女参加农业生产的工作深入到广大农民中，深入到家庭中，使妇女从积极劳动中去提高自己的地位同时贯彻了家庭民主的教育。这样工作的结果在各地就出现了许多李顺达式的团结生产的新式家庭，妇女们在和睦的家庭中积极参加了田间生产、表现了惊人的劳动效率，随之也就大为提高了妇女的地位和妇会的威信，这样就既反对了不顾妇女切身痛苦，不保证妇女人权的错误观点，也避免了造成家庭对立，影响团结生产的偏向。
    其次是打破了光讲“男女平等”大道理的老一套工作方法，而是找出当地妇女生产模范事实和作用，通过群众自己互相说服来认识了发动妇女参加农业生产的重要，和应该男女平等的道理。使大家能心服口服的批判了轻视妇女和妇女轻视劳动的错误思想，造成了劳动妇女最光荣的舆论，使大部妇女踊跃的投入了田间生产，太行壶关六区以此经验发动妇女参加春耕播种达到全村妇女的百分之八十。
    现在许多地区对发动妇女还做的很不够，应该善于运用这些经验，积极的从封建习俗的束缚中解放出农村妇女的劳动力，使之成为农业生产战线上的一支劳动大军，在实现今年的增产任务中发挥其伟大的作用。
