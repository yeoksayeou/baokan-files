    Opinions on the Guo Zhuang Homespun Industry

    The Guo Zhuang area of Wuji, due to the changes in the North China situation and certain blindness in production, has gone from prosperity to decline. Yufeng Store (state-owned), which used to buy the most cloth, has decreased its purchases from 60,000 bolts per month last winter to an average of 40,000 bolts per month now. Five private small cloth shops on North Su Street have all closed. Due to the decline of the cloth industry, weaving households in various places have also stopped working one after another. In Mujiazhuang in the Fourth District, more than 60 households used to weave cloth, but now only more than 20 households are still weaving. In Guzhuang in the Fifth District, 250 looms were operating last winter, but now there are only more than 80 looms, and the quality of the cloth is not high. Most of these surplus laborers have turned to agricultural production, a small part has turned to small merchants, and some are waiting to see what happens.

    Guo Zhuang cloth's main markets are Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Now Zhao (County) cloth, Tang (County) cloth, and other local and foreign cloths are flowing in large quantities, and the Guo cloth market is shrinking day by day. Except for the higher quality Shiqi and Junmin brands of cloth, which can still be sold, other brands and substandard cloth are difficult to sell. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, many hawkers who used to transport cloth went to Tianjin and Beijing to sell goods, and the promotion force has also been reduced.

    Furthermore, a large amount of grain and cotton flows into Tianjin and Beijing to supply industrial raw materials, so the price of raw materials has risen faster than the price of cloth. This spring, when the price of cloth increased by ten yuan (People's Currency, same below) per foot, the cost of yarn for each bolt of cloth had already increased by twelve to twenty yuan from the original price. There is no profit in weaving cloth (the most profitable individual high-quality cloths only earn three catties of rice), and raw materials have driven up the price of cloth, making it even more difficult to sell homespun. Although Yufeng and the county promotion agency are implementing cotton-for-yarn and yarn-for-cloth programs to maintain the due profit for weaving households, their power is ultimately not great.

    Although these problems already exist, the leadership lacks necessary measures, and has not timely conducted situation education and explained the importance of improving quality to the masses and weaving households. The Industry and Commerce Section is only busy collecting industrial and commercial taxes, and has not carried out extensive publicity in the market. As a result, weaving households lack sufficient understanding of the changes in the situation, the future of the homespun industry, and the importance of improving quality, and they are not prepared for job changes. This has led weaving households to complain that cloth shops are giving low prices, and those who weave substandard cloth even say: "Don't think my cloth can't be sold, it will sell for more than good cloth when the market is tight." All cloth shops have a phenomenon of accommodating substandard cloth (such as insufficient ruler length), which also affects the improvement of quality. In addition, various places do not pay enough attention to textile supply and marketing. Although the promotion agency has identified seven key points for organizing village supply and marketing cooperatives, there are few achievements.

    Based on the above situation, I would like to offer a few suggestions for the Guo Zhuang homespun industry problem for research:

    1. Under the unified leadership of the Party, extensive and in-depth education should be carried out for textile households, so that weaving households have a clear understanding of the current situation, the changes in the production environment, the future of the homespun industry, and the importance of improving quality, overcome the blindness of production, and prepare them for job changes.

    2. The issue of improving quality should not be simply a matter of increasing or decreasing the price of cloth. Emphasis should be placed on educating weaving households to eliminate the idea of ​​mystery and trickery. The industry and commerce administration should focus on regularly inspecting the quality of cloth received by cloth shops. The promotion agency and Yufeng should consolidate existing textile groups through cotton-for-yarn and yarn-for-cloth programs, and grasp the spirit of rewards and punishments through exchange relationships to stimulate quality improvement. Facts have proven that high-quality homespun cloth still has profits (currently maintaining three catties of rice) and is marketable.

    3. Each production unit should focus on helping organize supply and marketing cooperatives in areas with more developed textile industries to purchase raw materials and reduce the cost of homespun cloth. At the same time, they should organize the transportation of homespun cloth to the Northwest region in exchange for livestock, sulfur, ironware, etc., which is more profitable than selling cloth locally, so that weaving households can maintain a certain profit.

    4. Leaders in various places should attach importance to this issue that is related to the people's livelihood. They should insist on maintaining the consolidated and high-quality textile groups and households, educate and help those with low technology to improve quality, and pay attention to introducing job changes and solving the living problems of those who are at a loss due to the decline of the cloth industry.

### 对郭庄土布业的意见

    对郭庄土布业的意见
    无极郭庄一带的土布业，由于华北形势变化及生产上的某些盲目性，现已由繁荣走向萧条。过去收买布最多的裕丰商店（国营），已由去冬每月收六万匹减至现时每月平均四万匹。北苏街上五个私人小布店均已停业。由于布业的萧条，各地织布户也相继停工。四区穆家庄六十多户，过去家家织布，现时织着的还有二十多户。五区古庄去冬动着的织布机二百五十架，现时只有八十多架，布质量亦不高。这些剩余的劳动力，除大部转向农业生产外，一小部分转给小商贩，还有的是在观望。
    郭庄布主要市场是晋、察、绥等地，现赵（县）布唐（县）布及其他各地土布洋布大量流入，郭布市场日渐缩小，除质量较高的士奇、军民等牌号布尚能行销外，其他牌号及次布均难销售。平津解放后，过去运布小贩多到平津贩运物品，推销的力量也减小了。
    再者大批粮棉流入平津，供给工业原料，因此原料比布价上涨还快。今春每尺布价提高十元（人民币下同）时，则每匹布的线子成本，已比原价上涨十二元至二十元。织布没有利润（个别质量高的最多的才赚三斤米），原料促使布价提高，土布更不易销出。虽有裕丰及县推进社实行以棉换线，以线换布，以保持织布户应得利润，但力量终究是不大。
    这些问题虽已存在，但领导上尚缺乏必要措施，对群众与织布户未及时进行形势教育及讲明提高质量的重要，工商科只忙于征工商税，在市场上亦未作广泛宣传。因之，使织布户对形势变化、土布前途、提高质量等问题认识不足，对转业也没有准备，致织布户埋怨布店给价钱小，织次布的还说：“别看我的布卖不了，等闹行情时还得比好布多卖钱。”各布店均有迁就次布现象（如尺梢不足等），这对提高质量也有影响。另外，各地对纺织供销注意也不够，推进社虽确定了组织村供销合作社的七个重点，但成绩尚少。
    根据上述情况，对郭庄士布业问题，提出几个意见，以供研究：
    一、在党的统一领导下，对纺织户应进行广泛深入的教育，使织布户对目前形势、生产环境的变化、土布业前途、提高质量的重要等问题，有清楚的认识，克服生产的盲目性，对转业亦使其有所准备。
    二、提高质量问题，不仅单纯在布价上划多划少，应着重教育织布户取消玄虚耍巧思想，工商行政着重经常检查各布店收布的质量，推进社、裕丰通过以棉换线，以线换布巩固现有的纺织小组，通过交换关系，掌握奖惩精神，刺激质量的提高。事实证明质量高的土布还是有利润（现时保持三斤米）有销路的。
    三、各生产单位应有重点以纺织业较发达地区，帮助组织供销合作社，采购原料，减低土布成本，同时应有组织的运土布到西北地区换牲畜硫磺、铁器等，这样比在本地卖布利大，使织布户维持一定利润。
    四、各地领导上要重视这一关系人民生计的问题，对巩固的质量较高的纺织组、户要坚持，对技术不高者要教育与帮助提高质量，对因布业萧条而无所适从的，要注意介绍转业，解决其生活问题。
