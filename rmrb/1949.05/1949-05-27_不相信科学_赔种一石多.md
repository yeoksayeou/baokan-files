　　Disbelief in Science
  　Leads to Compensation of Over One Stone of Seeds
    [Chahar News] When the Hengshan Farm mobilized the masses in Dongxinzhuang Village, Hunyuan County, to prevent and control oat black jaundice and promote hot water seed soaking, some cadres developed an acute problem. They did not believe in scientific principles and doubted the effectiveness of hot water seed soaking. Fearing that black jaundice would still occur after the autumn harvest, they blindly mixed the already soaked seeds with more than 0.4% of coating agent No. 1 (Note: Dry mixing the medicine with the seeds alone is harmless, but it is harmful if soaked first and then mixed). After discovering this, they immediately stopped it. After sending people to check door-to-door, it was found that the germination of oats of seven households was affected. In order to maintain the credibility of the promotion, they compensated the households whose seeds had not sprouted with one stone and one dou of seeds in total for replanting. At that time, the masses believed that the hot water had scalded the seeds to death, and they discussed: "Nonsense! The government has plenty of grain, just compensate!" Later, after repeated explanations, the slogan "Soak seeds without mixing, mix seeds without soaking" was put forward, and other facts of seed soaking were used to tell everyone to make comparisons. Some hot water soaked seeds not only did not spoil, but also sprouted two days earlier, proving that the cause of the spoilage was not seed soaking, but too much medicine mixed after soaking. This turned the masses' thinking around. Now some people are automatically asking for medicine to mix with millet seeds, and saying: "Let's see the effect after the autumn harvest!" (Provincial Government Note: Such blind, unscientific lessons of failure should be deeply reviewed and are worthy of vigilance for all farms and promotion sites in the future!)

　　不相信科学
  　赔种一石多
    【察哈尔讯】恒山农场在浑源县东辛庄村动员群众，防治莜麦黑疸，推广温汤浸种时，个别干部犯了急性病，不信科学道理，怀疑温汤浸种的效力，惟恐秋后仍然发生黑疸，便盲目的将已浸过的种籽，又拌了千分之四以上的涂抹制剂一号（按：单以药干拌种，无害，如浸了再拌即有害），发觉后立即制止，经派人挨户检查，有七户的莜麦影响发芽。为了维护推广的威信，对未出芽的户，共赔偿了种籽一石一斗，使其补种。当时群众认为水热把种籽烫死了，纷纷议论：“瞎胡闹，公家有的是粮食，赔吧！”后经反复解释，提出：“浸种不拌种，拌种不浸种”的口号，并拿其他浸种的事实，来告诉大家，进行比较。有些温汤浸种的不但没有坏，反而早出两天苗，证明坏的原因不是浸种，而是浸种后又拌药太多了。这样才扭转了群众的思想。现又有人自动要药拌谷种籽，并说：“秋后看效果吧！”（省政府按：这样盲目的，非科学的失败教训，应深刻检讨，并值得各农场、各推广场今后警惕！）
