Chahar Province, Chicheng Newly Opened Over 900 Mu of Paddy Fields

[Chahar News] Thirty-one villages along the Heihe and Baihe rivers in Chicheng have newly opened 941 mu of paddy fields, exceeding the original plan by 202 mu. A total of 21 new and repaired large canals have been completed, transforming 2,298 mu of dry land into paddy fields, exceeding the original plan by 1,813 mu. This is expected to increase coarse grain production by 1,206 dan. In the first district, Cheng Guan, Yuren Fort, and other eleven villages, some people were unwilling to go into the water during canal construction. Comrade Zhao Yuming, a district cadre, took the lead by rolling up his trousers and entering the water. Seeing this, the group leaders also followed suit, motivating the masses. The masses have already begun to release water and plant rice.
