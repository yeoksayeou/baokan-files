[Jinan Dispatch] The Daming Municipal Committee is guiding women to switch from hand spinning and weaving to braiding straw hats, providing them with a means of livelihood. Before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, most women in Qianjie, South Town, relied solely on their men for support, lacking production skills. After liberation, under the leadership of the municipal government, they gradually learned to spin and weave. According to statistics from February of this year, 36 women were engaged in weaving and 172 in spinning, with their livelihoods largely dependent on these activities. With the successive liberation of large cities, machine-made industrial products were transported and sold throughout the country, greatly impacting the hand spinning and weaving industry. The Municipal Committee and relevant departments, based on the actual situation, specifically studied and organized women to braid straw hats and weave hat bodies as an alternative to spinning and weaving. Subsequently, cadres from various streets and towns went door-to-door to discuss and organize the women's transition. The director of the street women's association first organized ten women who knew how to braid, successfully running a trial using a piece-rate bonus system, which boosted the confidence of other women. To support this production development, the town cooperative paid 10,000 RMB to support the straw hat business, and purchased wheat straw from the countryside to solve the raw material shortage, while also purchasing braids to supply the women who knew how to make hats, giving them appropriate profits based on the thickness of the braids and the quality of the hats. Having gained practical benefits, more than 50 women have already transitioned.

    纺织无利掏草帽辫
    【冀南电】大名市委会领导妇女由手工纺织转向掏草帽辫，妇女生活有了依靠。市南镇县前街妇女，日寇投降前，大部不会生产，单纯依靠男人生活；解放后，在市政府领导下，她们逐渐学会纺花织布。据今年二月统计，从事织布的就有三十六人，纺花的一七二人，她们的生活来源，大部依靠于此。大城市相继解放，机器工业产品运销各地，手工纺织业大受影响。市委会及有关部门，根据实际情况，具体研究组织妇女掏草帽辫、编草帽代替纺织。随后，各街、镇干部分头挨户进行酝酿，组织妇女转业。街妇会主任首先组织了十名会编的妇女，以记件分红办法试办成功；其他妇女信心也提高。为支持这一生产发展，镇合作社付出人民币一万元，扶助草帽庄，并一面从乡村收买麦茎，解决原料困难；一面收买辫子供给会编帽的妇女。依辫子粗细、帽子质量，给以适当利润。妇女们得到实际利益，已转业者达五十余家。
