Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, Rome: The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labour has decided to temporarily suspend strikes, go-slows, and other forms of struggle because the General Confederation of Labour and the Employers' Federation reached an agreement in principle on the 5th regarding the commencement of negotiations. It called on all relevant trade union federations across the country, especially those in the chemical, metallurgical, and other industries, to implement this decision.  Tuanjie Bao [Solidarity News] pointed out: The employers tried to impose unacceptable, one-sided conditions on the working people, but the General Confederation of Labour overcame the employers' stubborn opposition and achieved a great victory. This "proves that the significant sacrifices made by workers in some sectors over many months to defend the established rights and freedoms of the trade union are justified." This success should be attributed to the strong and united spirit displayed by workers in the chemical and metallurgical industries. The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour decided on the 5th that if the Employers' Federation continued to resist, it would declare a national general strike. This decision played a decisive role in overpowering the employers.

    意总工会领导工人斗争
    压服雇主顽抗
    【新华社北平八日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利总工会执行委员会因总工会与雇主联合会于五日关于开始谈判达到原则上协议，特决定暂时停止罢工、怠工等形式的斗争，并号召全国各有关工会联合会，特别是化学、冶金等工业中的工会，执行这一决定。团结报指出：雇主们力图将不能接受的片面条件强加于劳动人民身上，但是，总工会压服了雇主们的顽固反对，并取得了巨大胜利，这“证明某些部门工人许多月来因为保卫工会既得权利和自由而付出的重大牺牲是有道理的”。这一成功应归功于化学工业及冶金工业工人所表现的坚强和团结精神。总工会执行委员会曾于五日决定：如果雇主联合会继续反抗，即宣布全国总罢工，这一决定对压服雇主起了决定性的作用。
