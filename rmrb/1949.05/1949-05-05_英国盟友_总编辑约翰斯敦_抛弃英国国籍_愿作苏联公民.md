Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Moscow dispatch: Johnston, the editor-in-chief of the Russian-language publication "British Ally," published by the British Foreign Office in Moscow, has angrily resigned from his position at the British Embassy, abandoned his British citizenship, and broken with the current British government in order to oppose the British government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies and to oppose the North Atlantic Treaty, led by American and British imperialism, which leads to war. He has decided to remain in the Soviet Union and strive for the cause of peace. Johnston sent a letter to Pravda announcing his decision. Johnston revealed that "British Ally," published in Moscow, ostensibly promotes friendly relations between the Soviet and British people, but in reality, it uses this as a pretext for anti-Soviet propaganda. He wrote: "Labour leaders such as Bevin, Attlee, and Morrison are helping American and British monopoly capitalists attempt to extract huge profits from war, and I feel that I can no longer be their tool... I have lived in the Soviet Union for twenty years, I am familiar with the lives of the Soviet people, and I am deeply convinced that only the social system existing here in the Soviet Union is truly just, free, and democratic." The article also mentioned why he wanted to stay in the Soviet Union: "The reason I made this decision is because the Soviet Union is the leading force in the struggle for peace, a force that unites the best and most progressive forces in the world."

    抛弃英国国籍
    愿作苏联公民
    【新华社北平四日电】莫斯科讯：英国外交部在莫斯科出版的，俄文刊物“英国盟友”的总编辑约翰斯敦，为了反对英国政府反动的内政外交政策、反对以美英帝国主义为首的导向战争灾难的北大西洋公约，已愤而辞去英国大使馆的职务，抛弃了英国国籍，与现在的英国政府决裂，并决定留居苏联，努力为和平事业奋斗。约翰斯敦曾致函真理报，宣布了他的这个决定。约翰斯敦揭露：英国在莫斯科出版的“英国盟友”表面上以促进苏英人民的友好关系为名，实则借此进行反苏宣传。他写道：“贝文、艾德礼、莫里逊等工党领袖，正帮助美英独占资本家企图从战争中获取巨大的利润，我觉得我自己再也不能当他们的工具了……我一直在苏联住了二十年，我已熟知苏联人民的生活，我已深信只有苏联这里存在着的社会制度才是真正正义、自由和民主的”。文中又说到他为什么要留居苏联：“我所以作此决定，是因苏联是争取和平的领导力量，这个力量把世界上最优秀的与最进步的力量团结在一起”。
