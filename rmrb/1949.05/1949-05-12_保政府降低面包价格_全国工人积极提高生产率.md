All efforts are focused on increasing productivity. Trade unions are establishing technical training classes for workers to improve their skills. In Sofia, there are 60 training classes with 2,100 educated workers. In Varna, there are 67 training classes with 2,000 workers being trained. The trade unions are striving to support and encourage the movement for rationalizing production. Nearly 2,000 production rationalizers and inventors are playing a leading role in factories and workshops. Due to various improvements and the use of new machinery, they have all exceeded production quotas. The trade unions are using the method of organizing labor competitions to increase labor productivity. 76 percent of employees in factories and institutions across the country participated in this year's May Day competition. The trade unions are in charge of implementing the measures stipulated in the three-year plan to improve the conditions of the working class and all working people. Large-scale housing construction has begun nationwide, and tens of thousands of workers will move into new homes this year.
