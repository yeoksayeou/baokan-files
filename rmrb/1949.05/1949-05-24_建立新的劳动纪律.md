Establishing New Labor Discipline

　　The news about Zhang Zonghua's violation of labor discipline published in today's newspaper, although an isolated incident, carries universal educational significance. That is to say, in a new democratic society led by the proletariat, the working class should regard all public enterprises as their permanent property, possess a high degree of consciousness, and enthusiastically engage in glorious labor to the best of their ability. They should establish a new labor attitude and new labor discipline and wage a merciless struggle against all acts of sabotage and slowdowns. Previously, Xinhua News Agency rebroadcast an article from the Soviet Labor News titled "On the Communist Attitude Toward Labor." Xinhua News Agency similarly emphasized this point in its editor's note.

　　In order to support the People's Liberation War, restore and develop the national economy, and create more wealth for the country, the working class in the North China Liberated Area has enthusiastically launched a considerably broad production competition movement in the past and present. During the movement, a large number of labor heroes emerged, with many creations, greatly improving the quantity and quality of production. Under the education of the Party and the Trade Union, workers have raised their class consciousness and clearly established a new labor attitude. But this does not mean that all employees and all factories are good. No, in some places today, there are still phenomena of lax anarchism and old consciousness and styles. On the one hand, this is because a few employees still have, to a greater or lesser extent, what the article "On the Communist Attitude Toward Labor" refers to as: "enthusiasts with a personal pocketbook." They only want to find a "favorable position," "do less work, and earn more money." Most of these people have been influenced by the old society for a long time, and it is difficult to change them immediately after liberation. They still use the old perspective to treat new things. On the other hand (this is the main reason) is because: our factories and trade unions lack class education work for the majority of employees. In management, they have not earnestly implemented democratic management relying on the working class, but instead, discipline is lax, leadership is abandoned, and the factory director's final decision-making power is abandoned, resulting in scattered, extreme democratization. Instead of improving workers ideologically and removing some old and backward views from employees, they cater to and accommodate these views. The above situation is harmful to the cause of the new democratic country and must be seriously inspected and corrected, and must not be allowed to drift.

　　The basic method to solve this problem is to fight against this incorrect attitude, constantly educate workers with a class stand, viewpoint, and attitude, and the main method of this education is to earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and establish new labor discipline on the basis of workers' consciousness and democratic management. So that the working class can truly show itself in action as a socially leading class with organization and discipline, it is necessary to promote the consciousness and willingness shown by the working class in improving labor productivity, establishing new labor discipline, and creating national wealth. Lenin once said: "The current task is mainly to concentrate all the forces that the proletariat can concentrate, and the absolute unity of the proletariat, on the peaceful task of economic construction and the task of restoring destroyed production. This requires iron discipline, iron-like ranks. If we do not have this discipline and ranks, we will not be able to support it for not only more than two years, but even two months." Every public enterprise, trade union, and worker should understand this spirit and strictly enforce labor discipline in order to concentrate our strength on the cause of restoring and developing production.

### 建立新的劳动纪律

专栏：短论

　　建立新的劳动纪律
    今日本报所载的张宗华违犯劳动纪律的消息，虽是一个个别的事件，但却带有普遍的教育意义，这就是说：在以无产阶级为领导的新民主主义社会里，工人阶级应当把一切公营企业都看作是自己的永久财产，要有高度的自觉，尽自己能力所及，热情地从事着光荣的劳动，建立新的劳动态度和新的劳动纪律，同一切怠工、破坏现象作无情的斗争。日前新华社曾转播了苏联劳动报“论共产主义的劳动态度”一文，新华社在按语中同样着重地指出这一点。
    华北解放区的工人阶级为了支援人民解放战争，恢复与发展国民经济，为国家创造更多的财富，过去和现在都热烈地开展了相当广泛的生产竞赛运动；在运动中，涌现出大批的劳动英雄，有着很多的创造，大大地提高了生产的数量和质量。在党和职工会的教育下，工人提高了阶级自觉，鲜明地树立起新的劳动态度。但这并不等于说所有职工和一切工厂都好了。不是的，在若干地方今天仍然存在着散漫的无政府现象以及旧的意识和作风，这一方面是由于少数职工中间仍然或多或少地存在着一种有如“论共产主义劳动态度”一文所指出的那样：“个人口袋的热心家”。专想找到“有利的地位”，“少作事，多拿钱”，这些人大都是受旧社会濡染日久，刚刚解放之后，一时难以改变，对待新事物，他们仍然用的是旧眼光；另一个方面（这是主要的）则是由于：我们工厂和职工会对广大职工还缺乏阶级的教育工作，在管理上还没有认真地实行依靠工人阶级的民主管理，而是纪律废弛，放弃领导，放弃厂长最后决定权，以致发生了散漫极端民主化现象，他们不是从思想上提高工人，不去清除职工中某些旧的落后观点，反而去迎合迁就这些观点。以上情形，对新民主主义国家事业是有害的，必须严肃地进行检查纠正，切勿任其自流。
    解决这一问题的基本方法是必须与这种不正确态度进行斗争，不间断地教育工人以阶级立场、观点和态度，而这种教育方法，主要地是要认真去开展批评和自我批评，在工人自觉和民主管理基础上建立新的劳动纪律。使工人阶级真正在行动上表现自己是一个有着组织性和纪律性的社会领导阶级，要发扬工人阶级在提高劳动生产率，建立新的劳动纪律，创造国家财富方面所表现的自觉和自愿，列宁曾这样说过：“现在的任务主要把无产阶级所能集中的一切力量，把无产阶级底绝对统一都用到经济建设的和平任务及恢复被破坏了的生产任务上去，这里需要有铁一般的纪律，铁一般的整齐行列，若是没有这种纪律和行列，那我们不仅不能支持两年有余甚至两个月都是不能支持的”。每一个公营企业，职工会及工人都应领会这一精神，严整劳动纪律，以便把我们的力量集中到恢复与发展生产的事业中去。
