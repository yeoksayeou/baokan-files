    North China Urban Supply and Marketing Cooperative Conference Decides
    To Systematically Exchange Urban and Rural Goods
    Gradually Eliminate Market Blindness
    [This newspaper dispatch] The six-day North China Urban Supply and Marketing Cooperative Conference concluded successfully on April 30. In addition to exchanging experiences on entering urban work, representatives from various cities and districts focused on discussing the role of supply and marketing cooperatives in the exchange of urban and rural goods and determining specific methods for future implementation. The discussion unanimously agreed that unblocking the exchange of urban and rural goods is a crucial key to restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production. Cooperatives must actively take on this task. The purpose of their operations should first be to promote the products of cooperative members and meet the needs of cooperative members' consumer goods. Secondly, it should serve the brotherly cooperatives and state-owned economy in various cities and administrative regions. The business guidelines and principles must take the state-owned economy as its leading core (for example, if Tianjin salt is to be transported to other places for sale, the city's cooperative general society should establish a relationship with the salt company), thereby establishing direct links between the general supply and marketing cooperatives of various administrative regions and cities, gradually forming the supply and marketing business into a supply and marketing network, closely cooperating with state-owned trading companies, factories, and shops, helping them sell finished products and purchase raw materials, and gradually getting rid of market blindness. If cities need large quantities of grain and industrial raw materials, they should conduct investigations in advance, estimate their own strength, and do it in a planned and step-by-step manner, preventing purely commercial activities that do not take into account the supply and demand relationship of the market, thereby stimulating price fluctuations. The exchange of urban and rural goods should adhere to the principle of mutual benefit in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products in terms of profit. Only in this way can the enthusiasm for exchange relationships continue to be maintained. At present, in addition to establishing mutual exchange relationships between the general supply and marketing cooperatives of various administrative regions and cities, farmer service centers (or cooperative warehouses) can be established in cities such as Ping, Tianjin, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang to not only carry out work to connect with farmers in the surrounding countryside, but also to carry out the regulation of materials between brotherly cooperatives in various regions and cities, help them promote products, and introduce businesses. There are the following three forms for carrying out the exchange of urban and rural goods: (1) Acting as a buyer and seller. Acting as an agent to purchase or promote the grain, raw materials, and other finished products of brotherly regional cooperatives, but first, we must try our best to meet the needs of our own members and promote the finished products of our own members and state-owned factories and stores as soon as possible. This is meaningful for guiding which items should be produced in various cities. If the items produced by cooperative members or state-owned factories cannot complete the task of purchasing as an agent, they can be purchased from the market, but they should closely contact local cooperative systems, trade and industry departments. If too many finished products are sold on behalf of others and the members do not need them, they can be sold directly to the market (but the price should be slightly higher than that of the members). A certain handling fee should be obtained for acting as a buyer and seller, and it should be negotiated with each other according to the different conditions of the operation, transportation, and storage of the goods. The time, price, and quality of the goods to be sold and purchased must be clearly stated in advance. The proceeds from acting as a buyer and seller shall not be used without the consent of the other party. If the storage time is long, the state or cooperative bank can be entrusted to store it for interest. We must resolutely maintain credit in order to consolidate mutual relations. (2) Bartering. This method can prevent price fluctuations and achieve the exchange of urban and rural materials, so this method should be used as much as possible. However, in advance, the labor price, cost, etc. should be accurately calculated according to the different conditions of various items, and the normal exchange ratio between each item should be determined, such as how many catties of millet a plow is worth. One of the specific exchange methods is to exchange in whole for zero and exchange in zero for whole. For example, after the wheat harvest, the cooperative can purchase wheat from farmers according to a certain exchange ratio with certain industrial products, and then supply the industrial products needed by farmers to repay the wheat price; the latter is like organizing farmers to collect various industrial raw materials in small quantities, and when the time is right, supply the farmers with the supplies they need to offset them. Another method is to allocate goods in batches and price them in installments. For example, grain from Chahar Province can be transported to Pingjin in batches. If the payment is made in one lump sum, it is unfavorable to the seller when prices fluctuate. Therefore, it can be paid in installments (such as once every ten days) and in batches (self-negotiated) at the current price. (3) Cash on delivery.
    In addition, the conference also discussed the relationship between cooperatives, state-owned trading companies, factories, and brotherly cooperatives in the exchange of materials, operating techniques such as transportation packaging, item quality, allocation of cadres, exchange prices, and how to organize production cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in cities. Directors Meng and Liang gave detailed instructions on these issues in their final speeches. The representatives also initially introduced the items that their cities and districts could promote and needed to be supplied from other places, such as: Tianjin needs a large amount of grain, and many cotton textiles urgently need to be sold; eastern Hebei needs a large number of rubber shoes (used by coal miners), while many cotton, white oil, and wool can be sold in large quantities. As the representative of eastern Hebei said: "No one buys the bristles and wool of eastern Hebei, so they rot, and we don't know that Tianjin needs them so much! This meeting does solve the problem." Finally, according to the needs and sales volumes of various cities and regions, the representatives of various places have initially established exchange business relationships with each other.

    华北城市供销合作会议决定
    有计划交流城乡物资
    逐渐摆脱市场盲目性
    【本报讯】历时六天的华北城市供销合作会议于四月三十日完满结束。各市区代表除交换进入城市的工作经验外，并着重地讨论了供销合作社在城乡物资交流中的作用及确定今后实施的具体办法。讨论中一致认为：为恢复与发展工农业生产，畅通城乡物资交流是重要的关键。合作社必须积极负起这个任务。其经营的目的，首先应推销社员生产品及满足社员消费品。其次是为各市、各行署区兄弟社及国营经济服务。经营方针和原则必须以国营经济为其领导核心（如天津食盐欲运往他处销售，市合作总社即应与食盐公司建立关系），从而建立各行署区、市供销总社的直接联系，把供销业务逐渐形成供销网，密切的配合国营贸易公司、工厂、商店，帮其推销成品及收购原料，逐渐摆脱市场上的盲目性。如城市需要大批粮食、工业原料，即应事先经过调查，估计自己本身的力量，有计划有步骤的去做，防止不根据市场的供求关系，而进行单纯的商业活动，以致刺激物价波动。城乡物资交流，在利润上应把握工农业品交换两利的原则，只有如此，才可能继续保持交换关系的积极性。目前除各行署区，市供销总社建立相互的交换关系外，可在平、津、保、张、石等市设立农民服务所（或称合作货栈）除进行联系四乡农民的工作外，并进行各区、市兄弟社间的物资调剂及帮助其推销产品及介绍业务。在进行城乡物资的交流上，有以下三种形式：（一）代买代卖。代为收购或推销兄弟区社的粮食、原料及其他成品，但首先要尽量满足自己社员的需要和尽先推销自己社员和国营工厂、商店的成品。这对指导各个城市应该进行那些物品的生产是具有意义的。如社员或国营工厂所生产物品，不能完成代买任务时，可向市场采购，但应与当地合作系统、贸易工商部门密切联系。如代卖成品过多而社员不需要时，可直接向市场出售（但价格应稍高于社员）。代买代卖应取得一定手续费，按物品之经营运输与保管的不同情况，互相商订。货物之销购时间、价格及质量，在事先必须讲清楚。代买代卖之货款非经对方同意，不得动用，如存放时间较长，可代为存放国家或合作银行生息，坚决保守信用，以巩固相互间的关系。（二）以物易物。这种方式既可防止物价波动，又可切实作到城乡物资的交换，故应尽多采用这种方式。但这在事先应根据各种物品之不同情况，精确计算劳动价格成本等，订出各货间的正常交换比例，如一个铁犁值多少斤小米。其具体交换办法之一为整拨零还和零拨整还，如麦收后，合作社可按与某种工业品之一定交换比例收购农民的小麦，到时供给农民所需用的工业品，以清偿麦价；后者如组织农民零星收搜各种工业原料，等一定时候，供给农民所需要的用品以抵消。另一种办法是整批拨货，分期分批作价。如察哈尔省的粮食可整批运来平津，若一次付款，在物价波动时对出售者是不利的，因此可采用分期（如每十天一次）分批（自己商定）按当时价格付款。（三）现款交货。
    另外，会议中并讨论了合作社在交换物资中，与国营贸易公司、工厂及各兄弟社间的关系、经营技术如运输包装、物品质量、配备干部、交换价格以及在城市如何组织生产合作社与消费合作社等问题，孟、梁主任在其最后发言中均对这些问题作了详尽的指示。代表们并初步的介绍了自己市、区的可推销和需要别处供给的物品如：天津需要大批粮食，许多棉织品则急需销出；冀东则需大批胶鞋（煤矿工人用），而许多棉花、白油、羊毛、则可大量销出。如冀东代表说：“冀东的猪鬃及羊毛无人收购，以至腐烂，而我们就不知道天津如此需要它！这个会的确是解决问题。”最后，根据各市、区的需求和推销量，各地代表相互间已初步建立了交换的业务关系。
