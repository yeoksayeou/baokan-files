    Ping Municipality Federation of Trade Unions Invites Flour Mill Owners to Symposium to Solicit Opinions on Various Policies

    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon (the 9th) at 2 PM, the Ping Municipality Federation of Trade Unions invited managers from various machine-operated flour mills in the city to a symposium. Sixteen managers from various mills attended. Comrades Zhu Yuheng and Chen Yongwen, representatives from the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, attended and expressed the hope that the mills would raise their opinions on policies, labor-management relations, factory management, business conditions, and tax rates so that everyone could discuss and resolve them. The opinions reflected by the mills can be summarized into three points: (1) The increased electricity consumption by citizens for lighting between 6 PM and 11 PM every night affects machine production. (2) The procedures for stamp duty are too cumbersome. (3) A very small number of workers take excessive leave, which also affects production. According to the mills, business conditions have improved since liberation. The manager of Fuxing Flour Mill said: In 1946, the mill averaged 600 bags per day; in 1947, 800 bags per day; in 1948, affected by American flour, 500 bags per day; in January of this year, 170 bags per day; in February, 240 bags; in March, 500 bags; in April, 700 bags; and from the 1st to the 8th of May, 1,300 bags per day, greatly exceeding the highest level before liberation. Everyone believes in the correctness of the policy of benefiting both labor and management, and the workers' production enthusiasm will definitely be enhanced. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. Representatives from the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions promised to bring back the opinions of the mills and submit them to relevant authorities for research and resolution.

    平市工总邀集面粉厂主座谈
    征询对各项政策意见
    【本报讯】平市职工总会昨（九）日下午二时邀集本市机器面粉业各厂厂主举行座谈会，到各厂经理十六人。市职工总会筹委会代表祝玉珩、陈用文两同志出席，希望各厂把对政策、劳资关系、工厂管理、营业情况及税率方面的意见都提出来，大家讨论解决。各厂反映的意见归纳起来有三个：（一）每晚六至十一时市民电灯用电增多，影响机器生产。（二）印花税手续过繁。（三）极少数工人请假过多，也影响了生产。据各厂反映，解放后的营业情形都有进步。复兴面粉厂经理说：三十五年该厂平均每天产六百袋，三十六年每天八百袋，三十七年受美粉影响，每天产五百袋，今年一月每天一百七十袋，二月份二百四十袋，三月份五百袋，四月份七百袋，五月份一日至八日每天一千三百袋，大大超过了解放前最高水准。大家都相信劳资两利政策的正确，工人生产情绪一定提高。会议于四时半散会，市职工总会筹委会代表允将各厂意见带回，送请有关机关研究解决。  （鸣）
