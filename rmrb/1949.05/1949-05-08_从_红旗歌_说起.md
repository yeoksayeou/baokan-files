Starting with "Red Flag Song"
Li Bozhao

"Red Flag Song" deserves a red flag. This is the audience's cry. It has educated the audience: the liberated working class's attitude towards labor is serious, enthusiastic, and joyful! It brings us infinite excitement and joy! Individual "backward" elements are motivated by the advanced, old labor attitudes are transformed, and patient persuasion and education replace old staff and old styles, all working hard to develop production and compete for that glorious little red flag that rewards labor models. All of this is conveyed to the audience through typical characters, typical personalities, and typical language. The audience eagerly hopes to see and hear countless "Red Flag Songs"! What in the world is more joyful, more glorious, and more meaningful than labor? Labor and production will create everything, transform everything, and drive history forward!

Developing production, transforming the consuming city of Beiping into a producing city, is such an arduous and heavy historical task! It concerns the greatest welfare of the vast majority of people, and it concerns the consolidation and development of the fruits of revolutionary victory. Our literary and art workers should write more about labor heroes and production models, reflect various economic policies, grasp the theme of production, be the closest friends of the workers, learn production knowledge from them, help and mobilize workers to write literary and artistic works, workers to perform plays, workers to sing songs, workers to paint, and stir up their highest production enthusiasm. This is a collective creation with epoch-making significance. Through such works, we can educate and transform everyone, so that everyone loves labor and loves production. Those who do not work are despised. Those with poor labor attitudes are criticized. In the process of going deep into life and creating works, the purpose of educating and transforming literary and art workers themselves will also be achieved. I hope that advanced friends in the literary and art circles will provide guidance. I am willing to work hand in hand with many young friends in the literary and art circles! Do the most practical work, use the greatest effort to sing the praises of labor, sing the praises of production, and practically support the victory of the front lines. Coordinate with various construction tasks to build Beiping into a beautiful and vibrant "producing city."

    从“红旗歌”说起
    李伯钊
    “红旗歌”应该得红旗。这是观众的呼声。它教育了观众：解放了的工人阶级劳动态度是严肃、热情、愉快的！它带给我们无限的兴奋与愉快！个别“落后”的被先进的带动了，旧的劳动态度被改造，旧职员旧作风代之以耐心的说服教育，一齐努力发展生产，争夺那面奖励劳动模范的、光辉的小红旗。一切这些都是从典型性人物、典型性格、典型的语言传达给观众的。观众热望看到，听到无数的“红旗歌”呵！世界上除了劳动还有什么比它更愉快、更光荣、更有意义呢？劳动生产会创造一切、改造一切、推动历史的前进！
    发展生产，把消费的北平城变为生产的北平城，是多么艰巨而繁重的历史任务呵！关系着绝大多数人最大的福利，关系着革命胜利果实的巩固与发展。我们文艺工作者要多多的写劳动英雄生产模范，反映各种经济政策，抓紧生产主题、与工人做最亲密的朋友，向他们学习生产知识，帮助并发动工人写文艺作品，工人演戏，工人唱歌，工人画画，鼓起他们最高的生产热情，这是一部具有划时代意义的集体创作。通过这样的作品来教育和改造一切的人，要人人热爱劳动，热爱生产。不劳而食的人，受到鄙弃。劳动态度不好的受到批评。在深入生活和创作作品的过程中，同时就会达到教育和改造文艺工作者自己的目的。希望文艺界的先进朋友来指导，我愿意和许多文艺界的青年朋友们一块携手前进！做最实际的工作，用最大的努力来歌颂劳动，歌颂生产，实际支援前线的胜利。配合各种建设工作，把北平建设成为一座美丽的富有生命的“生产城”。
