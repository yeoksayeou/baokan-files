The reason Nurse's Day is set on May 12th is to commemorate Ms. Florence Nightingale, who was born in Florence, England on May 12, 1820. Her father was Englishman William Edward Nightingale.

Ms. Nightingale was full of entrepreneurial spirit and had firm ambitions. She was unwilling to give up despite the thorny road ahead. At that time, the idea of "independent living" among British women was unheard of. Even if there was such a desire, it was not allowed by law and social customs. Ms. Nightingale was very interested in nursing work. In 1845, she hoped to receive training at Salisbury Hospital. However, due to her mother's opposition, she was unsuccessful. But the lady's aspirations did not diminish. Finally, in 1849, she traveled to Egypt, Greece, and finally to Kaiserswerth, where she worked in a hospital for three months. She deeply felt the lack of nursing training in church hospitals at that time. In 1853, she went to Paris to inspect the Paris hospital organization, and later returned to England to serve as the superintendent of the "Women's Hospital," where she received praise from doctors and patients during her year of service.

In March 1854, after Britain, France, and Turkey declared war on Tsarist Russia, Ms. Nightingale, in order to improve nursing and medical work, organized a rescue team with friends Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge and others, and set off for the front line on October 21, 1854. This was the first time female nurses served in the British army. In the feudal society of Britain at that time, it was an incredible revolutionary move!

Due to Ms. Nightingale's continuous efforts, nursing work gradually improved. By the end of the war, the number of nurses in the army had increased from a dozen to 125. She also made every effort to implement strict regulations for nurses to obey and cooperate with medical personnel in order to exert greater medical effects. She not only contributed to nursing science but also, for the sake of scientific production, funded the construction of an anatomy room for military doctors, which was the origin of the establishment of the later military medical school.

In February 1856, the war ended. She returned to her country to engage in writing work at the "Royal Commission." In 1860, she cooperated with the London Hospital to open the "Nightingale School of Nursing," which was the beginning of nursing schools.

In 1862, she worked in India again. In 1864, she engaged in factory nursing improvement work, and later engaged in research on local nursing. The lady passed away on August 13, 1910, and was buried in Wellow, Hampshire.

Ms. Nightingale's life's work is truly admirable. Today, when celebrating this International Nurse's Day, I hope that every nursing staff will emulate Ms. Nightingale's great spirit to serve the people!

### 护士节起源与南丁格尔女士

    护士节起源与南丁格尔女士
    护士节所以定为五月十二日，乃纪念佛罗伦斯南丁格尔女士，她于一八二○年五月十二日生于英国的佛罗伦斯，其父为英人威廉爱德华南丁格尔氏。
    南丁格尔女士富于事业精神，且志向坚定，虽荆棘满路，亦所不愿，当时英国女子中“独立生活”的说法，真是闻所未闻。即使有这种志愿，也是法律与社会风俗习惯所不许。南女士对护理工作甚感兴趣，一八四五年，希望到骚尔斯巴利医院受训。然由于母亲的反对，未能成功。但女士志愿并未稍减，终于一八四九年旅行至埃及、希腊，最后至开塞斯威尔斯，得在医院中工作三月。她深感当时教会医院中缺乏护理训练。一八五三年她到巴黎视察巴黎医院组织，后回英任“妇人病院”监督，在服务一年中，得到医师及病人的赞许。
    一八五四年三月，英、法、土诸国向帝俄宣战后，南丁格尔女士为改良护理医疗工作，与友人布累斯布利治夫妇等人组织救护队，在一八五四年十月二十一日起程赴前线，这是当时英国军队中有女护士服务之创举。在当时英国封建社会中，实是一种不可思议的革命举动！
    由于南女士不断努力，护理工作逐步改善，到战争终了时，军中护士已由十数人增至一百二十五人，她并竭力实行护士对医药人员服从、合作的严正规章，以发挥医疗更大之效果，她不仅在护士学上有供献，为生产科学起见，出资建筑解剖室供军医之用，这就是后来军医学校成立的起源。
    一八五六年二月战争终了，她返国从事著作工作于“皇家委员会”，并于一八六○年与伦敦医院合作，开办“南丁格尔护士学校”，是为护士学校之创始。
    一八六二年她又在印度工作，一八六四年从事于工厂护理改良工作，后又从事于研究地方护理。女士卒于一九一○年八月十三日，葬于＠①姆普郡之韦罗。
    南丁格尔女士之一生事业，实堪钦佩，当今日庆祝此国际护士节之时，希望每个从事护理人员，均要效仿南丁格尔女士之伟大精神为人民服务！
