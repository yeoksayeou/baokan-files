　　The Rights and Obligations of Soviet Trade Unions
　　Translated by Ding Ming
　　A Soviet trade union cadre who once traveled to the United States said to me: An American, upon learning that we have no strikes, once said, "It seems you have nothing to do."
　　Since a strike is a struggle between labor and capital, and our country is a socialist state, naturally, there will be no such phenomenon, because all industries in our country do not belong to capitalists, but to the country of workers and peasants. Thus, there is no conflict between workers and employers. However, it would be wrong to think that our trade unions have nothing to do. On the contrary, our trade union cadres are actually very busy. This is largely because Soviet law provides trade unions with some opportunities to protect workers' rights, opportunities that are completely absent in capitalist countries.
　　For example, the supervision of the implementation of labor protection laws, safety regulations, and industrial hygiene is carried out by trade unions. In addition, trade union inspectors have full authority, and the management must respect their orders. If their orders are ignored, they have the right to fine those who commit such errors.
　　In fact, such situations are rare, because where there is no capitalist exploitation, there can be no deliberate attempts to sacrifice workers' health in the name of "saving money." However, we also have individual personnel who neglect regulations, and in view of this, the law authorizes trade unions not only to fine management representatives who violate labor laws but also, when negligence of regulations endangers workers' health and safety, to bring criminal charges to court and impose criminal sanctions. For example, recently the procuratorate, at the request of our state committee, took legal action against the construction director of a shipyard who neglected statutory safety regulations.
　　The methods that trade unions can use are not limited to fines and legal action. If a trade union demands that the management dismiss an employee who systematically neglects the interests of workers, the management must comply. Needless to say, we rarely have the opportunity to use this right, but if such a situation does occur—if a capitalist tendency causes a director or supervisor to act in this way—he will soon lose his job. A few months ago, a supervisor at a shipyard in Leningrad insulted a young worker. We demanded his dismissal, and he was dismissed.
　　Differences of opinion with the management often arise if revisions to workers' work quotas or the determination of production rates for each industrial sector are not agreed upon by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, or if individual enterprises do not implement general regulations without the approval of the relevant state trade union committees. The trade union committee only approves a different production rate for a particular factory when there are sufficient reasons (such as improved machinery or rapid improvements in the work process). Without such reasons, the trade union exercises its veto power, and the production quota remains the same.
　　Like all the rights enjoyed by Soviet trade unions, the right to veto proposed changes to production quotas and rates is indeed a real right. This year, a supervisor at a shipyard in Leningrad arbitrarily increased the work quotas for certain types of workers. The workers complained. When we reviewed the issue of revising the quotas, we found that the technological progress achieved by the factory was not sufficient to justify the decision to increase the quotas. The previous quotas remained in effect.
　　Every factory and institution has a production rate and dispute committee to handle disagreements between management and workers or staff. This committee is composed of equal representatives from the management and the local trade union. If the committee cannot reach a unanimous decision on a dispute, the worker has the right to sue in court, and the trade union provides him with free legal advice. Even if the committee unanimously rejects the worker's or other staff member's grievance, the latter still has the right to appeal to the higher-level trade union and can appeal all the way to the central committee of his trade union or the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (also translated as the Executive Committee).
　　Dispute committees frequently discuss workers' dissatisfaction with dismissal. Every worker and staff member dismissed by the management can appeal to the committee, and even appeal to higher levels. Recently, the leader of a design modeling institution threatened to dismiss the archivist for not fulfilling her duties. The committee handling the matter proved that although the girl did not fulfill her duties, she could not be entirely blamed. No one, especially the leader who dismissed her, tried to make her interested in work and study. Moreover, although her work was unsatisfactory, she had never been disciplined or warned that she might be dismissed if she did not improve her work. This is clearly stipulated in the labor law.
　　The trade union representative on the committee argued that, in this case, her dismissal was a violation of the law and demanded that she be reinstated. However, the management representative disagreed, and the issue was referred to the state trade union committee for handling. The committee decided that the dismissal was too rash and that the archivist should be reinstated. The girl was reinstated. Moreover, the trade union considered this matter a symbol of the institution's lack of attention to the training and improvement of young people. An investigation report explained the shortcomings in this area, and after discussions between the committee and the management, these shortcomings were corrected.

　　苏联职工会的权利与义务
    丁明  译
    有一位曾经游历美国的苏联职工会干部对我说：有个美国人知道了我国没有罢工的时候，曾经说：“看来你们无事可作。”
    由于罢工是劳资的斗争，而我国是社会主义国家，自然就不会有这种现象，因为我国一切工业都不是属于资本家，而是属于工农国家的，从而工人与雇主之间就没有什么冲突可言。但是，如果认为我们的职工会无事可作，那就错了。相反的，我们的工会干部其实是很忙的，这大部分是因为苏联法律规定了给职工会一些保卫工人权利的机会，这些机会是资本主义国家中完全没有的。
    例如，对劳动保护法、安全法规和工业卫生的实施情形的监督，都是由工会执行的。此外，工会视察员具有充分的权力，经理部对他们的命令必须尊重。如果忽视他们的命令，那么对犯这种错误的人，他们有权处以罚金。
    其实，这种情形是少有的，因为没有资本家剥削的地方，就不可能有故意力图牺牲工人健康，以行“节约”的事。然而，我国也有玩忽法令的个别人员，而且有鉴于此，法律授权职工会不但可以处不遵守劳动法的经理部代表的罚金，而且当玩忽法令而损及工人健康与安全时，还可向法庭提出刑事诉讼，给以刑事处分。例如，最近检察处根据我们的州委员会要求，对玩忽法定安全规章的某造船厂建筑主任采取了法律行动。
    职工会所能运用的方法还不止罚款和法律行动。如果职工会要求经理部撤销那有系统地忽视工人利益的职员经理部便得照办。不消说，我们很少有机会使用这种权利，但如果真的发生这种情事——资本主义的倾向使某一主任或监督员这样做法，那他很快就会失掉工作。几个月前，列宁格勒某造船厂的监督员侮辱一个年青工人，我们要求撤销他的职位，而他便被免职。
    如果修改工人的工作份额；确定每一工业部门的生产比率没有得到全苏职工会中央委员会同意；个别企业不执行总的规章而没有得到有关的州职工委员会认可，那么，在这种情形下，就会常常发生与经理部的不同意见。职工委员会只有在具有充足理由（如改进了机器或工作进程有了迅速改善）时，才认可某一特殊工厂的不同生产比率。如果没有这种理由，职工会就实行否决权，生产额就维持原样。
    象苏联职工会所享受的一切权利一样，对于拟议中对生产份额与比率的改变的否决权，也确实是一项实实在在的权利。今年，列宁格勒某造船厂的监督员随意增加某几类工人的工作份额，工人提出不满意见，我们在检讨这修改份额的问题时发现：这个工厂所达到的技术进步，不足以确定这种增加份额的决定是正确的，从前的份额便仍然有效。
    每个工厂和机关都有生产比率与争议委员会，处理管理当局与工人或职员间的不同意见。这种委员会是由管理当局及当地工会同等代表组成的。如果这种委员会对有关争执不能达到一致决定，工人有权向法庭起诉，职工会给他以免费的法律顾问。甚至如果委员会一致批驳了工人的或其他职员的不满意见，后者仍有权向上级职工会申诉，而且一直可以上诉到他所属工会的中央委员会或全苏职工会中央理事会（亦译执行委员会）。
    争议委员会不时讨论工人对解雇不满的问题。每个被经理部解雇的工人与职员都可向委员会申诉，甚至可以向更上级申诉。最近一个设计模型的机关的领导人，扬言档案管理员不尽职责而把她解雇。处理这件事情的委员会证明：这个女孩虽然确实没有克尽厥职，但不能完全归咎于她。没有任何人，特别是解雇她的这位领导人想法子使她对工作和学习发生兴趣。而且，她的工作虽然不能令人满意，但她从未受过惩戒，也从未受到警告说：要是她不改善工作，她可能将被解雇。而这是劳动法上明文规定的。
    委员会中的职工会代表辩称：在这种情况下，她被解雇是违犯法律的，要求恢复她的工作，但是经理部代表不同意，这个问题便提请州职工委员会处理，该会决定说：解雇是太冒昧了，这个档案管理员应予复职。这个女孩便恢复了工作。而且，这件事情被职工会认为是该机关对训练与提高年青人不够注意的象征。调查报告书说明了在这方面的缺点，经委员会与经理部讨论后，这些缺点便纠正了。
