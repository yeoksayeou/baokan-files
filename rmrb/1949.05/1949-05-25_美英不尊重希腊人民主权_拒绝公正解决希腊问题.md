Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 24th: According to various sources, after TASS published on the 19th that the US and Britain were probing the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Greek issue, and Gromyko gave a clear answer to this issue, the US and Britain are still trying to deal with the Greek issue in their imperialist way, that is, in a way that does not respect the sovereignty of the Greek people. The British Foreign Office and the US State Department issued statements successively on the 20th, rejecting the proposals made in Gromyko's reply. They disagreed with calling for a ceasefire between the warring parties and resolving the Greek issue through peaceful negotiations. Instead, they demanded that the Greek issue be handled within the UN organization controlled by the US-British bloc, bypassing the Greek democratic forces. They evaded the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece raised by the Soviet Union. On the 19th, Truman also asked the US Congress to pass another 50 million US dollars in loans to Greece and Turkey. After the Greek royalist fascist government's ambassador to the United States visited the US State Department on the 20th, he clamored that the Greek democratic army must lay down its arms before peace can be negotiated.

　　美英不尊重希腊人民主权
  　拒绝公正解决希腊问题
    【新华社北平二十四日电】据各方消息，自塔斯社于十九日发表了美英试探苏联对希腊问题的态度，和葛罗米柯对此问题的明确答复之后，美英仍图按照它们的帝国主义方式，即不尊重希腊人民主权的方式来处理希腊问题。英国外交部和美国国务院二十日相继发表声明，拒绝葛罗米柯答复中所作的建议，不同意呼欲交战双方停战并以和平谈判解决希腊问题，而要求撇开希腊民主力量在美英集团所把持的联合国机构之内来处理希腊问题。对于苏联所提外国军队自希腊撤退问题则避而不谈。十九日杜鲁门还要求美国两院通过再予希士两国五千万美元的贷款。希腊保皇法西斯政府的驻美大使二十日走访美国国务院之后，叫嚣着要希腊民主军放下武器，才能谈判和平。
