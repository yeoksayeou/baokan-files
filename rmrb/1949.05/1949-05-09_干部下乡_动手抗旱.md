    Cadres Go to the Countryside to Fight the Drought
    Today's newspaper reports that cadres in Jinnan are going to the countryside to help farmers plant, which provides a good experience for the current drought resistance work. If cadres take the lead and implement typical demonstrations, coupled with careful organizational work, it is possible to set off a surge of drought resistance and planting.
    When the weather is dry and there is no rain, farmers urgently demand drought resistance methods. As long as the cadres truly go to the countryside to provide specific organization and leadership, they will quickly take action. From 1942 to 1943, we experienced a severe drought. As a result, we overcame it and gained a lot of experience. One of the most important is that cadres go to the countryside and work with farmers to break their possible mentality of waiting and luck, and the phenomenon of being helpless and resigned to fate. In particular, it is necessary to first make some achievements and use the facts to drive them. Be sure to summarize the farmers' experiences and help them think of effective methods. According to the specific local conditions, mobilize them to dig canals and wells, plant seeds in dry land, or prepare late-harvest seeds, organize labor and farm tools, and be able to rush to plant as soon as it rains... In short, the more urgent the situation, the more we should play our role as servants and leaders of the people, and do a good job in drought resistance and planting, which is the top priority.

    干部下乡  动手抗旱
    今日报载冀南干部下乡帮助农民播种的消息，给当前的抗旱工作提供了一个好经验。干部亲自动手，实行典型示范，再加以细密的组织工作，就可能掀起一个抗旱播种的热潮。
    天旱不雨，农民迫切要求抗旱办法，只要干部真正下乡给以具体的组织和领导，便会迅速行动起来。在一九四二年到一九四三年，我们经历过严重的旱灾的袭击，结果我们战胜了，所获经验很多，其中非常重要的一个，就是干部下乡，与农民一起，打破他们可能产生的等待、侥幸的心理，和束手无策、听天由命的现象，尤其需要先作出一些成绩，用事实把他们带动起来。一定要多总结农民经验帮助农民想些有效办法，根据当地具体情况，发动他们开渠凿井，干地寄种，或准备好晚收种籽，组织好劳力、农具，一旦得雨即能抢种………等。总之，越在这种紧急时候，越应发挥我们为人民的勤务员和领导者的作用，把抗旱播种这件头等重要的事情作好。
