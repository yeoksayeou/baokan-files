Strengthening Discipline to Promote Production
　Jizhong Eleventh Prefectural Committee Inspects and Improves Leadership
[Report from this newspaper] The Jizhong Eleventh Prefectural Committee is overcoming certain unplanned, unorganized, and undisciplined phenomena in production leadership, and continues to organize forces to make an all-out effort to rush planting. In April, the organization of carrying water to plant in some drylands achieved considerable results. For example, in Wuqiang's six districts, cotton planting reached 90 percent of the assigned task. According to statistics from Zhao County, Moujin, Moucheng, Jin County, and Donglu County, a total of 1,300 new and repaired old wells were added. Secondly, in Jin County, Moucheng's five districts and thirty-two villages, the irrigated land was expanded by 15,000 mu.

At the end of April, the Prefectural Committee inspected production and found the following shortcomings and problems in leadership: (1) The Prefectural Committee failed to provide specific guidance based on the specific conditions of various places regarding drought prevention and preparedness. General instructions were more common than specific guidance, and wells were dug in areas where digging earth wells was not feasible. In particular, it was not good at seizing the season to solve major problems. During planting, the Prefectural Committee inappropriately decided that ten districts in Cheng and Zhao counties should complete the collection of last year's outstanding public grain by the end of April, which affected planting in the area. (2) Some counties distributed planting tasks to districts and villages based only on past planting habits, lacking investigation into the current conditions. They blindly put forward unrealistic plans. (3) Leaders at all levels were not thorough enough and could not grasp the situation in time, leading to laxity in leadership. (4) In the previous stage, insufficient attention was paid to organizing drought-resistant planting, especially mobilizing women, children, and other semi-labor forces to fully invest in planting. Although attention was paid to this in the second half of April, much time had already been lost.

The main obstacles to production leadership at present are the lack of confidence of individual county and district cadres in completing tasks, and the lack of organization and discipline of some cadres, leading to relaxed production leadership. For example, some were dealing with marriage problems, while others often went home and did not work. In early May, the Prefectural Committee again dispatched cadres to the countryside to specifically supervise and issued instructions, calling on cadres to work hard to lead the people to overcome the drought and complete planting.

### 加强纪律推动生产　冀中十一地委检查改进领导

　　加强纪律推动生产
  　冀中十一地委检查改进领导
    【本报讯】冀中十一地委克服生产领导上某些无计划无组织无纪律现象，继续组织力量全力突击播种。四月份某些旱地组织挑水点种有相当成绩，如武强六个区点种，棉花即达分配任务百分之九十，据赵县、某晋、某城、晋县、东鹿五个县统计，新增加修理旧水井共一三○○眼，其次如晋县、某城五个区三十二个村，扩大了浇田一万五千亩。
    四月底，地委检查生产，发现领导上有以下缺点和问题：（一）对防旱备荒，地委未能根据各地具体条件作具体指导。一般指示多于具体指导，对没有挖土井条件的地区，也空挖井；特别是不善于抓住季节解决主要问题，在播种时地委会不适当的决定城、赵县十个区于四月底完成征收去年公粮的尾欠，因而影响了该地区的播种。（二）有的县向区村分配种植任务，只根据以往种植习惯，对现有条件缺乏调查。盲目的提出不切实际的计划。（三）各级领导不够深入，不能及时掌握情况，形成领导上的鼓励。（四）前一阶段中，对组织起来抗旱播种，特别是发动妇女、儿童及其他半劳力全部投入播种是不够重视的，自四月后半月，虽引起注意，已误时不少。
    目前生产领导上的主要障碍，是个别县区干部对完成任务缺乏信心，和某些干部的无组织无纪律放松生产领导。如有些闹婚姻问题，有些常常回家不工作等。五月初地委又抽调干部下乡具体督促，并发指示，号召干部艰苦奋斗领导人民战胜旱灾，完成播种。
