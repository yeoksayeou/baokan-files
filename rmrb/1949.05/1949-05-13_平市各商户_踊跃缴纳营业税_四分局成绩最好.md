Merchants in Ping City
    Eagerly Pay Business Tax
    Fourth Branch Achieves Best Results
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the issuance of payment notices for the spring business tax levied this year by the Municipal Tax Bureau, merchants have been enthusiastically going to designated banks to pay their taxes. As of yesterday, 33.17 million yuan in taxes had been received from the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh sub-bureaus, totaling 6,306 households, accounting for one-fifth of the city's total households. The fourth sub-bureau achieved relatively remarkable results. This is because when the sub-bureau issued payment notices, it separately convened talks with various industries, explaining the payment procedures and regulations in detail. After the merchants understood, they were able to quickly go to the designated banks to pay their taxes within the specified date. On the 11th and 12th alone, the amount of tax paid by merchants under the jurisdiction of the sub-bureau reached more than 21.7 million yuan, accounting for two-thirds of the total tax paid. A total of 2,023 households paid, accounting for one-third of the households that have paid taxes.

    【本报讯】本市税务局本年度开征之春季营业税自发出缴款书后，各商户赴指定银行缴款者颇为踊跃。截至昨日止，已收到所属第一、二、三、四、五、六、七分局税款三千三百十七万元，计六千三百零六户，占全市总户数五分之一。其中以第四分局成绩比较显著。因该分局在发出缴款通知书时，曾分别召集各行业谈话，详细解释缴款手续及规章。各商户明了后，均能在规定日期赴指定银行迅速缴款，仅十一、十二两日内，该分局所属各商户之缴款额已达二千一百七十余万元。占已缴税款总额三分之二。计二千零二十三户，占已缴税款户三分之一。
