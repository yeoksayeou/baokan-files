    Today's "May Day"
    Li Yongfu, Worker at Qinghe Serge Mill

    Fellow workers and comrades: "May Day" is the most joyous and inspiring day for working people all over the world, the most memorable day of the year. Comrade Yu from our factory also told us that the emergence of Labor Day is of great significance in the history of the workers' struggle. We have many feelings as we commemorate and celebrate it here and now. I recall the eight years of oppression and bestial abuse suffered under the Japanese, which left us gasping for breath. Workers endured pain and swallowed their anger to work for a living, eating mixed flour and living a miserable life! All of us workers sincerely hoped to overthrow Japanese imperialism as soon as possible and escape from our bestial lives. After Japan surrendered, I thought we had won and should be honored and happy. But it was not so. The Kuomintang reactionaries exploited us by all means, making it even harder for us to breathe! At that time, soldiers and grain were seized every day, and families were torn apart... Workers lived an even more painful life! Now we are liberated. We are no longer oppressed by the Kuomintang and exploited by the four big families. We are living a happy life. Therefore, this year's "May Day" is our first happy Labor Day! Fellow workers, they should all understand that now that we are commemorating our own festival, we must continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the working class, recognize that labor creates everything, work hard to step up production, increase social wealth, and take on the responsibility of future construction. Fellow workers across the country, the army is now marching south. We workers must show the spirit of hard work and endurance, work hard to produce, support the front, support the People's Liberation Army, and completely liberate all of China. Fellow workers across the country! Let the Chinese nation become an independent and democratic country in the world. We hope that fellow workers across the country will swing their hammers and axes to create a bright road!

    今天的“五一”
    清河制呢厂工人李永福
    诸位工友同志们：“五一”是全世界劳动人民最欢欣鼓舞的一天，每一年中最值得纪念的日子。我们工厂余同志也给我们讲过，劳动节的出现在工人斗争史上是有极大的意义的。我们在此时此地纪念它庆祝它，有许多感想。我回想八年来受到日本人的压迫，牛马般的虐待，使我们喘不过一口气来、工人为了生活，忍受痛苦，忍气吞声地做工、吃混合面、生活悲惨万分！各位工友们都赤诚的盼望早打倒日本帝国主义，脱出牛马生活。在日本投降以后，我想已经胜利了，是该荣幸，快乐了。可是不然，国民党反动派，用种种手段剥削我们，更使我们喘不过气来！在那时候每天抓兵纳粮，妻离子散……工人过着更苦痛的生活！现在我们解放了，我们再不受国民党的压迫，和四大家族的剥削了，我们过着快乐的生活。所以今年“五一”是我们第一个快乐的劳动节！各位工友们，他们都该明白，现在我们纪念自已的节日，要继续发扬工人阶级革命精神，认识到劳动创造一切，努力加紧生产，增加社会财富，担负起今后建设责任。全国工友同志们，现在大军南下了，我们工人要拿出吃苦耐劳的精神，努力生产，支援前线，支援解放军，彻底解放全中国。全国工友同志们！使中华民族成为世界独立民主的国家，希望全国工友同志们，轮快锤子斧头，创造光明的大道！
