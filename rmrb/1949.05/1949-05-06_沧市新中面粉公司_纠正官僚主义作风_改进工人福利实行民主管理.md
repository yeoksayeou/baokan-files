    [Jizhong News] The state-owned Xinzhong Flour Company in Cang City, during the previous stage, had leading cadres who exhibited a bureaucratic work style, neglected reliance on workers, and mismanaged production. The workers' union existed in name only and did not function. The factory management committee did not include worker participation. This led to the administrative branch taking over everything. In increasing production, instead of educating workers, raising awareness, and establishing a new attitude towards labor to develop competition, they relied solely on administrative power, excessively extending working hours to demand production achievements from workers. The machine room stipulated a twelve-hour work system every day, causing workers to become overly fatigued... This led to extreme dissatisfaction among the workers, forming a serious opposition between the workers and the factory. Twenty transportation workers submitted requests to leave the factory and return home.

    In February, cadres were adjusted. With the direct help of the Cang City Municipal Party Committee and the Jizhong Administrative Office, inspections were carried out. In Party meetings, struggles were launched against the incorrect ideas of individual cadres who did not rely on workers, neglected worker welfare, and caused disunity. Following this, a joint celebration was held for all employees, and the leadership publicly reviewed its mistakes and apologized to all workers. The workers' preparatory committee was reorganized. Five worker representatives democratically elected by the workers were absorbed into the factory management committee. Worker welfare was conscientiously improved. In terms of study, managers and staff gave workers regular lessons, explaining the newspaper. Cultural and recreational activities were launched to prepare for the "May 1st" celebration. Workers' lives were under their own management, and meals have been improved, reducing waste. In the past, each person ate 140 catties of rice per month and still wasn't well-fed. Now, only 84 catties are needed, and they eat better than before. Working hours and labor organization have also been rationally adjusted. In the past, the boiler team workers worked in shifts of four, with each person only working six hours per day and night. The machine room operated two shifts per day and night, working twelve hours. Now, it has been universally adjusted to an eight-hour work system with three shifts per day and night, correcting the unreasonable phenomenon of uneven labor intensity. After this rectification, the workers' labor attitude and class consciousness have been greatly improved. They automatically pay attention to saving raw materials and reducing costs. In the past, each bag of flour burned 25 catties of coal; now, it has been reduced to 14 catties.

    纠正官僚主义作风
    改进工人福利实行民主管理
    【冀中讯】沧市国营新中面粉公司，在前一阶段领导干部存有官僚作风，忽视依靠工人，管理生产。职工会有名无实，不起作用。工厂管理委员会，没吸收职工参加。形成行政支部包办，在增加生产上，不是从教育工人，提高觉悟，树立新的劳动态度来发展竞赛，而是单纯地依靠行政力量，过多的延长工作时间向工人要生产成绩。机器房每天规定十二小时的工作制，工人过于疲劳……。因而引起了工人极度不满，形成工人与工厂严重对立。有二十个运输工人，提出了离厂回家的要求。
    二月份，调整了干部，在沧市市委和冀中行政公署的直接帮助下，进行检查，在党的会议上，对个别干部，不依靠工人，忽视工人福利，闹不团结等等不正确思想展开了斗争。接着召开了全体职工联欢会，领导上公开检讨错误，并向全体工人道歉。重新整理职工筹备委员会。吸收工人民主选出的五个职工代表参加工厂管理委员会。认真改进工人福利，在学习上经理和职员按时给工人上课，讲报纸。开展文化娱乐准备纪念“五一”。工人生活在自己管理下，伙食已得到改善，减少浪费。过去每人每月伙食米一百四十斤，还吃不好，现在只八十四斤，比过去吃的还强。工作时间和劳力组织也进行了合理调整。过去锅炉组工人四人轮班，每昼夜每人只工作六小时，机器房每昼夜两班，工作十二小时，现在普遍调整为每昼夜三班的八小时工作制，纠正了劳力轻重不合理的现象。经此整顿后，工人的劳动态度和阶级觉悟已大为提高，自动地注意节省原料降低成本，过去每袋面烧煤二十五斤，现在已节约到烧十四斤。
