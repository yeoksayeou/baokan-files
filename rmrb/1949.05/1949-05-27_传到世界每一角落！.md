　　Spread to Every Corner of the World!
    After returning home from the World Peace Congress, the Soviet delegation immediately began reporting on the conference in Moscow and cities across the country. The Soviet delegation brought the hopes of peace-loving people worldwide to the Soviet people, strengthening the cooperation between the Soviet people and the vast global population. Our delegation, along with the large delegations from seventy other countries, will convey the common call of the world's people – to defend peace – to every corner of the world with the same enthusiasm! What a great and powerful action this is! The whole world is consolidating and uniting in the movement to defend peace, with the inviolable peace fortress of the Soviet Union at its head, marching in step, forging ahead bravely, and striving for an incomparably bright future for lasting world peace and democracy.
