Jizhong Electricity: In order to connect urban and rural areas and promote material exchange, the Jizhong Trading Company, after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, transported a large number of industrial products to inland cities to supply rural needs, and transported large quantities of agricultural products such as food, cotton, and oil into the cities. As of the end of April, incomplete statistics show that industrial products transported to the interior included: 59,520 bolts of fine cloth, 235,000 jin of kerosene, 21,000 pieces of cotton yarn, 41.62 million jin of coke, as well as pigments, sugars, alkaline noodles, stationery, etc., totaling 495.6 million yuan in value. These have been transported to major markets in Jizhong, such as Cangzhou, Hejian, Xinji, Anguo, and Botou, for sale to farmers. In addition, 62 million jin of agricultural products such as grain, 2.27 million jin of lint cotton, 2.3 million jin of white oil, and other items such as mats, ramie, and homespun cloth have been transported to major cities. This has played a significant role in urban-rural material exchange, solving the difficulty of food shortages and industrial raw materials in the cities, and finding outlets for agricultural products, which has been welcomed by workers and farmers in various regions.

Also reported: In order to strengthen urban-rural material exchange and support the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, the Jizhong State-owned Dasheng General Store has agreed on supply and marketing business relations with the Baoding and Qingyuan supply and marketing cooperatives, based on the following three principles: (1) Barter. The Dasheng Store supplies industrial products and daily necessities to the masses through the supply and marketing cooperatives, while the supply and marketing cooperatives deliver industrial raw materials and agricultural products to the Dasheng Store in order to promote urban-rural material exchange and reduce middleman exploitation. (2) Wholesale pricing, installment payments. The Dasheng General Store supplies industrial products and daily necessities in bulk to the supply and marketing cooperatives at prices 3% to 5% lower than the market price. The supply and marketing cooperatives then pay for the goods in installments. This will effectively support the development of the supply and marketing cooperatives and directly facilitate mass production. (3) Cash transactions. The supply and marketing cooperatives exchange the masses' products, raw materials, or cash for industrial products and daily necessities, and then exchange or purchase industrial products and daily necessities at the Dasheng General Store, achieving unified supply and marketing. Based on the above principles, the Dasheng General Store and the two supply and marketing cooperatives have exchanged a large number of industrial products such as fine cloth, kerosene, salt, and coal, as well as agricultural products such as lint cotton, and the masses' accumulated scrap copper, etc.

    【冀中电】冀中贸易公司为了沟通城乡关系，促使物资交流，平津解放后，就大批运到内地城市许多工业品供应乡村需要，并把农产品的食粮、棉花、油类大批运入城市。截止四月底，运入内地工业品据不完全统计有：细布五万九千五百二十匹，煤油二十三万五千斤，棉纱二万一千块，焦炭四千一百六十二万斤，以及颜色、糖类、碱面、文具……等共计总值四万九千五百六十万元，现已分别运到冀中各主要市场，如沧市、河间、辛集、安国、泊头等地，出售给农民需用。并将农产品粮食六千二百万斤，皮棉二百二十七万斤，白油二百三十万斤，及其他席子、苎麻、土布等运入各大城市。对城乡物资交流，起了很大作用，解决了城市缺粮与工业原料的困难，又给农产品找出销路，受到各地工人与农民的欢迎。
    【又讯】冀中国营大生总店，为了加强城乡物资交流与扶植供销社的发展，已与保定、清苑两供销社约定了供销业务关系，按以下三个原则：（一）以物换物，大生商店以工业品和群众日常必需品通过供销社供给群众使用；供销社则以工业原料及农业生产品交付大生商店，以便促进城乡物资交流，减去商人中间剥削。（二）整批作价，分批付款，大生总店以整批工业品和群众日常必需品，按规定低于市价百分之三至百分之五作价，供给供销社。供销社则分期分批的付交货物。这就会有效的扶植供销社的发展，直接便利群众生产。（三）现物现款交易，供销社以工业品及生活必需品换取群众的产品、原料、或现款，到大生总店交换或购买工业品及生活必需品，作到供销统一。根据上述原则，大生总店与两供销社已交换了大批工业品如细布、煤油、食盐、煤炭等及农产品之皮棉，及群众积存之碎铜等。
