　　[Jinan Electric Dispatch] With the wheat harvest approaching, the Ningnan County Production Promotion Cooperative has addressed the difficulties faced by the masses in disaster areas during the wheat harvest, taking into account the new circumstances this year. In the disaster areas of the county, the planting of tall-stalk crops such as sorghum and small hemp has historically been dominant, with wheat cultivation accounting for only about 10% of the cultivated land. Consequently, there was a scarcity of wheat harvesting tools. This year, however, the area planted with wheat reached 70%, creating a pressing need for harvesting tools. In light of this, the County Promotion Cooperative, in addition to ordering 1,000 sickles from iron and woodworking factories, purchased 4,500 sickles from Linqing City. Together with 5,500 jin of wheat waistbands (used for bundling wheat) and 200 forks already purchased, these were loaned interest-free to the masses in disaster areas based on the principle of recovering costs after the harvest. At the same time, the Promotion Cooperative also purchased a total of 103 head of cattle and donkeys from south of the Yellow River. Except for 27 head sold in non-disaster areas, the remaining 86 head were also loaned to the masses in disaster areas using a material-secured, cost-recovery method. The masses were extremely enthusiastic after receiving loans of sickles, wheat waistbands, forks, and draught animals, and they discussed among themselves: "The Promotion Cooperative is truly considerate, even thinking of providing wheat waistbands." It is estimated that all loans will be completed by May 20th.

　　宁南推进社无利贷放收麦农具
    【冀南电】麦收将届，宁南县生产推进社根据今年新情况，解决了灾区群众麦收困难。该县灾区，过去多种高粱、小麻等高杆作物，种麦仅占耕地面积百分之十左右，故麦收农具很少，今年种麦面积达百分之七十，麦收农具缺乏，乃群众亟待解决之困难。县推进社有鉴于此，除令铁木工厂打镰刀一千张外，又由临清市购来四千五百张，连同已买来之麦腰（捆麦绳）五千五百斤、叉子二百个，以保本原则，无利贷给灾区群众麦后归还麦子。与此同时，推进社又由黄河以南贩来牛驴共一百零三头，除二十七头在非灾区出售外其余八十六头亦用实物保本办法贷给灾区群众。群众贷到镰刀、麦腰、叉子、耕畜后情绪极高，纷纷议论：“推进社照顾的真周到，连麦腰也给想法。”预计五月二十日可全部贷完。
