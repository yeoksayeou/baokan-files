　　[News from Central Hebei] The pig bristle industry in Nanying and Guluo villages, Shenze County, has a history of over forty years. Merchants from Tianjin, Shandong, Baoding and other places often set up firms here to purchase bristles. In Guluo village, over three hundred out of four hundred households are engaged in this industry. During the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang rule, the industry was completely destroyed. Last spring, in order to restore the bristle industry in these two villages, the former Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank, using 25 million yuan in People's Currency, loaned money to farmers capable of managing this business through the bristle firms. By last autumn, five bristle firms had been restored. The state-owned Yijuxing Store controlled prices and purchased the goods here. Those who engaged in this business last spring and summer made considerable profits. According to statistics from two bristle firms in Guluo village, last year, they traded 25,000 catties of pig bristles and 300,000 catties of pig hair. This year, the four bristle firms in the two villages have only traded 5,900 catties of pig bristles and 50,000 catties of pig hair in three months. In the first half of last year, there were many customers, goods were sold quickly, and the price per catty rose from 100 yuan to 1,500 yuan; but in the second half of the year, it fell back to 500-600 yuan per catty. In February of this year, the price was relatively stable, generally 1,200-1,300 yuan per catty; but in the last three months, the number of vendors from Shandong increased, and the price per catty rose to 3,000-4,000 yuan. This kind of drastic price fluctuation has affected the development of this industry. State-owned enterprises should exercise appropriate control in order to promote rapid development.

　　深泽猪鬃业
  　行市不稳  影响发展
    【冀中讯】深泽南营、固罗两村的猪鬃业，有四十多年的历史。天津、山东、保定等地的客商多在这里设庄栈收买。固罗村四百户人家，就有三百余户经营此业。在日伪及国民党统治下，全被摧垮。去年春，原晋察冀边区银行为恢复该两村的毛鬃业，特以人民券二千五百万元，通过毛栈分别贷给能经营此业的农民。到去年秋季毛栈已恢复五处，公营义聚兴商店在这里掌握价格收买，去年春夏两季兼营这一业务的都获利不小。据固罗村两个毛栈的统计，去年一年，成交猪鬃二万五千斤，猪毛三十万斤。今年两村四个毛栈三个月则仅成交猪鬃五千九百斤，猪毛五万斤。去年前半年，来客多，下货快，每斤价格就由一百元涨到一千五百元；但后半年，每斤则又跌到五六百元。今年二月间价较稳，一般每斤一千二三百元；可是近三月，山东贩来增多，每斤价格即涨到三四千元。这种暴涨暴跌的情形，影响了这一行业的发展。国营企业部门应予适当掌握，以便迅速的发展。
