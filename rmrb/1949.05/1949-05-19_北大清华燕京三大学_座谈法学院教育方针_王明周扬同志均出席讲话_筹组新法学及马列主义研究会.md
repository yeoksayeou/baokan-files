　　Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University
  　Hold Symposium on Education Policy for Law Schools
    Comrades Wang Ming and Zhou Yang Attend and Speak
  　Preparations to Organize New Jurisprudence and Marxist-Leninist Research Association
    [Reported from this newspaper in Peiping] The law schools of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University held a symposium on law school education policy at 2:00 PM on the 17th at Peking University’s Zimin Hall. Attendees included Shen Junru, Wang Ming, Zhou Yang, Xie Juezai, He Sijing, Chen Jinkun, Li Mu'an, Zhang Shushi, Yang Shaoxuan, Wang Feiran, Shen Zhiyuan, Nan Hanchen, Guo Renzhi, Wang Xiaoyi, Zhang Naiqi, Zuo Zonglun, Ji Gongquan, Zhang Zhirang, Fei Qing, Rui Mu, Chen Fangzhi, Zeng Bingjun, Wang Tieya, ＠Bangyan, Qian Duansheng, Chen Daisun, Liu Chijing, Rao Yusu, Zhao Renjun, Dai Shiguang, Qian Jiaju, Zhao Naibo, Fan Hong, Chen Zhenhan, Zhao Chengxin, Lin Yaohua, Yan Jingyao, Lei Jieqiong, Pan Guangdan, Chen Da, and others, totaling forty people. The meeting was chaired by Qian Duansheng, who reviewed the shortcomings of past university law school education: incorrect viewpoints, a lack of reasonable coordination with social needs, and teaching materials that were mostly biased towards foreign content and disconnected from China’s reality. He explained that effective measures should be taken in the future to correct past shortcomings and establish a correct education policy.
    Next, the attendees spoke enthusiastically.
　　Zhou Yang
    Zhou Yang explained that university education should closely align with the needs of New Democratic national construction, not only to cultivate various specialized talents for the country, but also to organize existing experts to actively participate in the country’s current construction work with their specialized knowledge and to acquire new viewpoints and methods in their teaching and research work. Dialectical materialism and historical materialism, as well as knowledge of the basic theories and policies of the New Democratic Revolution, should have a definite place in university education, and this relies entirely on the joint efforts of Party and non-Party academic workers in this area.
　　Shen Junru
    Shen Junru advocated that the education policy must be practical and meet actual needs, combining theory with practice, so that what is learned can be put to practical use.
　　Wang Ming
    Wang Ming provided many opinions on the education policy of the law department. He said that it was correct and timely for the law department of Peking University to abolish thirteen old courses and open five new courses. The five newly opened courses represent a direction, that is, they indicate that teachers and students have chosen the direction of studying Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought in philosophy, economics, and politics. The basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and the basic issues of the Chinese Revolution can be studied in all departments. In addition, the law department should also study knowledge of New Democratic policies and various legal knowledge, study the judicial system and judicial technical knowledge for serving the people, and study new legal principles. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct criticism of old laws and study new legal theories. It is necessary to closely connect with the legislative and judicial work practice of the People's Government. He suggested initiating the organization of a New Jurisprudence Research Association to unite the legal circles of Tianjin and Peiping, as well as the entire country, and all those willing to study new jurisprudence to do research on new jurisprudence, assist the legislative and judicial work of the People's Government, and help the government to popularize legal knowledge among the people.
　　Chen Jinkun
    Chen Jinkun spoke about his experiences after going to the liberated areas and the changes in his thinking after self-study and personal practice. He said that law is subordinate to politics. Law protects class interests. The meaning of the people's democratic dictatorship is that more than 90 percent of the people unite to oppose a minority of reactionary elements. The purpose of the new law is to serve the more than 90 percent of the broad masses of the people.
　　Zhang Zhirang
    Zhang Zhirang believed that now everyone should absorb new ideas and establish new viewpoints on the one hand, and fully utilize and develop what they have learned in the past to serve the new society on the other. Professors Chen Da, Zhao Chengxin, Rui Mu, Wang Tieya, and Yan Jingyao expressed their opinions on issues related to the various departments of the law school. Fan Hong proposed organizing a Marxist-Leninist Research Association to strengthen professors' self-study. Xie Juezai and Nan Hanchen made speeches on judicial and economic matters. At the meeting, the organization of a New Jurisprudence Research Association was initiated on the spot, and the signatories to participate in the initiation were extremely enthusiastic. Zhang Zhirang and Ji Gongquan were designated to participate in the preparations, and Wang Ming was responsible for convening the preparatory meeting. In addition, Qian Duansheng, Fan Hong, Fei Qing, and Shen Zhiyuan were designated to prepare for the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist Research Association, with Fan Hong as the convener.

　　北大清华燕京三大学
  　座谈法学院教育方针
    王明周扬同志均出席讲话
  　筹组新法学及马列主义研究会
    【本报北平讯】北大、清华、燕京三校法学院于十七日下午二时假北大孑民堂举行法学院教育方针座谈会。出席沈钧儒、王明、周扬、谢觉哉、何思敬、陈瑾昆、李木庵、张曙时、杨绍萱、王斐然、沈志远、南汉宸、郭任之、王笑一、章乃器、左宗纶、冀贡泉、张志让、费青、芮沐、陈芳芝、曾炳钧、王铁崖、＠邦彦、钱端升、陈岱荪、刘炽晶、饶毓苏、赵人俊、戴世光、千家驹、赵乃搏、樊弘、陈振汉、赵承信、林耀华、严景耀、雷洁琼、潘光旦、陈达等四十人。由钱端升主席，他检讨过去大学法学院教育的缺点是：观点不正确，对社会需要缺乏合理的配合，教材多偏于外国的东西，与中国实际脱节；说明今后应采取有效的方式，矫正以往的缺点，确立正确的教育方针。
    接着各出席人热烈发言。
　　周扬
    周扬说明今后大学教育应密切配合新民主主义国家建设的需要，不但为国家培养各种专门人材，并且要组织现有专家各以自己的专门学识来积极参与国家当前的建设工作，并在自己教学研究工作中获得新观点、新方法。辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、新民主主义革命基本理论与基本政策的知识，在大学教育中应有其一定的位置，这全靠党与非党的学术工作者在这方面共同努力。
　　沈钧儒
    沈钧儒主张教育方针一定要切合实际需要，理论与实践结合起来，学来的东西能够实用。
　　王明
    王明对法律系教育方针，提供了许多意见，他说北大法律系废除十三种旧课程，新开五门课程，是正确的、适时的。新开的五门课程代表了一个方向。即是表示师生们选择了学习马列主义与毛泽东思想的哲学、经济学、政治学的方向。马列主义的基本理论与中国革命的基本问题，各学院都可以学习的。此外，法律系还要学习新民主主义的政策知识与各种法律知识，学习为人民服务的司法制度与司法技术知识，学习新法律原则。同时必须进行对旧法律批判，学习新的法律理论。必须与人民政府的立法工作与司法工作实践密切联系起来。他建议发起组织新法学研究会，团结平津及全国法学界以及一切愿意研究新法学的人们做研究新法学的工作，协助人民政府的立法和司法工作，并在人民中帮助政府进行普及法律知识工作。
　　陈瑾昆
    陈瑾昆讲了自己到解放区后的见闻及自己经过自我学习及亲身实践后思想的改变。他说法律服从政治。法律是保护阶级利益的。人民民主专政的意义是百分之九十以上的人民联合起来，反对少数反动分子。新法律的目的是为这百分之九十以上的人民大众服务。
　　张志让
    张志让认为现在大家一方面要吸收新思想，建立新观点，另一方面要充分运用发挥过去所学的东西，使能为新社会服务。陈达、赵承信、芮沭、王铁崖、严景耀诸教授各就法学院各系有关问题提出意见。樊弘提议组织马列主义研究会，以加强教授的自我学习。谢觉哉、南汉宸作了有关司法与经济的发言。会上当场发起组织新法学研究会，签名参加发起者极为踊跃，当推定张志让、冀贡泉等参加筹备，并由王明负责召集筹备会。此外，并推定钱端升、樊弘、费青、沈志远等筹组马列主义研究会事宜，以樊弘为召集人。
