The meeting did not end until 11:00 PM late at night.

    纪念“五四”
    北平昨开文艺晚会
    【本报讯】纪念“五四”文艺晚会，于昨（三日）晚七时在北大民主广场热烈举行，到会的工人、学生、教员达六千人。这是北平解放后，文艺界空前的一次盛会。讲演人与题目：闻家驷“文艺与政治关系”，冯至“什么是宽容”，赵树理“如何夺取反动文化的阵地”，卡之琳“谈文艺的修养”，李广田“关于北平文艺工作的回顾”，艾青“谈诗”，何其芳“知识分子与工农兵的结合”。会场的秩序和听众的情绪从始至终是宁静中充满了热烈，在灯光下每个人的脸都显得那么年青。大会直至深夜十一时始散。
