North China People's Government, North China Bureau and Military Region
    Telegraphic Congratulations on the Opening of the North China Workers' Congress

    [Our Newspaper News] The North China People's Government, the North China Bureau and the Military Region telegraphed the representatives of the First North China Workers' Congress, congratulating the opening of the congress. The telegram stated: Comrade Representatives of the First North China Workers' Congress of North China:
    Congratulations on the victorious opening of your congress!
    The First North China Workers' Congress is being held at a time when all of North China has been completely liberated and the entire North China region has fully entered the stage of construction. Therefore, the tasks undertaken by the congress are particularly important. We believe that the congress will certainly be able to follow Chairman Mao's call for labor-capital benefit, consideration of both public and private interests, development of production, and economic prosperity, and will be able to rationally solve the existing problems in public and private enterprises, such as democratic management, wage systems, worker unity, and labor discipline in factories, so as to achieve the goal of sufficient raw materials, low costs, high output, high quality, and wide sales, in order to achieve the purpose of restoring and developing production.
