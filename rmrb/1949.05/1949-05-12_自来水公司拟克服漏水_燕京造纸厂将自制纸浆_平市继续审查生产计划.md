    The Water Company Plans to Overcome Leakage
    Yanjing Paper Mill to Make Its Own Pulp
    Ping City Continues to Review Production Plans

    [This newspaper reported] The Beiping Municipal Enterprise Bureau held a meeting to continue reviewing the production plans of various public enterprises. Yesterday (the 11th), the production plans for the year of the Beiping Water Company and the Yanjing Paper Mill were reviewed. The Beiping Water Company has only been using and not repairing its facilities for decades. Also, because the underground water pipes are of different sizes and the water pressure is uneven, some places have no water, while others have serious water leakage, consuming 40% of the total water supply. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, each department of the company has formulated detailed repair plans. For example, the Dongzhimen Water Plant's reservoir, which has not been cleaned for eight years, has a lot of sand and mud at the bottom, affecting the cleanliness of the water. This time, it is planned to thoroughly clean it from August to early September. The laboratory will regularly conduct tests, disinfect, and inspect the water quality throughout the year, sterilize well water, and assist in leak detection. The repair and casting department will regularly cast water pipes throughout the year, maintain the necessary reserve materials, and regularly equip each unit with the required parts. In order to reduce water consumption and increase revenue, the water supply department will complete the installation of meters for users without meters from September this year to February next year, and expand water lines to increase water supply. In addition, 2,000 more users will be added throughout the year. At the meeting, in addition to pointing out that the phenomenon of water leakage in the past was serious and that the company should strive to achieve 100% utilization in the future and expand its business based on the existing foundation, the bureau director also emphasized that "it is necessary to reform the existing unreasonable organizational structure, and from managers, factory directors, and engineers to all employees, we must clarify the concept of serving the people." The Yanjing Paper Mill has also formulated an eight-month production plan. The first step is to change the old rules and make its own pulp. In the future, one machine will use waste paper, one machine will use waste cotton and rags, and gradually another machine will be opened to use wood pulp or reed pulp. The second digester will be installed by the end of June. Efforts will also be made to contact the Northeast to seek both temporary and permanent solutions. Develop during recovery, and transform during development. Finally, the Yanjing Paper Mill was encouraged to have its staff participate in trial operations, experiment with machines, plan costs, and improve the quality of paper.

    自来水公司拟克服漏水
    燕京造纸厂将自制纸浆
    平市继续审查生产计划
    【本报讯】北平市企业局会议继续审查各公营企业生产计划。昨日（十一日）审查北平自来水公司和燕京造纸厂的本年度生产计划，自来水公司数十年来只用不修，又因地下水管粗细不一，水的压力不均，有的地方没水，有的地方漏水严重，耗水占全水量的百分之四十。该公司为克服上述缺点，各部均订出详细修建计划。如八年没有洗刷过的东直门水厂的蓄水池，水底砂石泥土甚多，影响水的清洁，此次计划从八月到九月上旬彻底洗刷一次。化验室全年要经常进行化验，消毒，检验水质，进行井水杀菌并协助检漏工作。修铸部全年要经常铸造水管，维持保养应有的储备材料，经常配备各单位所需零件。供水科为了减少耗水，增加收入，今年九月到明年二月完成无表用水户的装表工作，并扩充水线，增加供水量。除此外，全年还要扩充两千用水户。在会上，局长除提出过去漏水现象严重，今后要争取达到百分之百的运用，并根据现有基础扩大业务外，又着重指出“必须改革现存的不合理的组织机构，从经理、厂长、工程师到全体职工，都要明确为人民服务的观念。”燕京造纸厂，也订出了八个月的生产计划，首先是改变旧规，自已制浆，今后要使一部机器用废纸，一部机器用废棉，破布，渐渐再开一部使用木浆或苇浆的机器，于六月底装成第二部蒸煮机。并争取和东北取得联系，求得一面治标，一面治本。在恢复中发展，在发展中改造。最后并鼓励燕京纸厂，工作人员要自己参加试办，试验机器、计划成本，提高纸的质量。
