    Taiyuan Frontline Laborers
    Return Home Victoriously
    [Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] The 100,000 laborers who supported the liberation of Taiyuan have victoriously completed their mission and are successively bidding farewell to the People's Liberation Army and returning to their hometowns. On April 27th, laborers from various regions and the People's Liberation Army attacking Taiyuan held farewell meetings near Taiyuan. The meetings were filled with an atmosphere of unity and victory between the army and the people. Representatives of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army spoke highly of the heroic, hardworking, and exemplary behavior of all the laborers in the war, and especially commended the contributions of the laborers from Suining, Shenze, Wuji, Wucheng, and Gucheng in Hebei. All the laborers proposed that after returning home, they would continue to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China with victories on the production front. Wang Baixiao, a 57-year-old labor hero from Shenze County, even requested that the higher authorities allow him to follow the People's Liberation Army to fight in the south. The People's Liberation Army presented flags to the meritorious labor groups who participated in the war. In the ranks of laborers returning to their villages, prominent flags fluttered in the wind.

    太原前线民工
    胜利返乡
    【晋中电】支援解放太原的十万民工，胜利完成任务，已陆续握别解放军返回家乡。四月廿七日，各地民工与攻打太原的解放军在太原附近分别举行告别会议。会中洋溢着军民团结胜利的气氛。解放军某部代表在讲话中多方赞扬全体民工在战争中的英勇刻苦等模范行为，特别表扬了河北肃宁、深泽、无极、武城、故城等地民工的功绩。全体民工则提出回家后将以生产战线上的胜利继续支援解放军解放全中国。深泽县五十七岁的民工功臣王白小并要求上级允许他跟解放军打到江南去。解放军纷纷给参战有功民工团体献旗。在各路民工返里的行列中，迎风飘扬着显明的旗帜。
