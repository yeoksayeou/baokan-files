One of the Summer Epidemics - Dysentery

As the hot summer approaches, the dreaded bacillary dysentery is once again becoming prevalent. It has started earlier this year, beginning in early April, and the number of cases has gradually increased by early May. According to recent statistics from the Children's Hospital, bacillary dysentery patients account for about 20% of the total number of patients (about 40 out of every 200 patients per day are dysentery patients). This incidence rate will continue to increase in June and July. From this, it can be inferred that there are at least a thousand bacillary dysentery patients in Beiping. Therefore, the prevalence of bacillary dysentery in Beiping is indeed a very serious problem and deserves the attention of the medical community.

The period of bacillary dysentery prevalence in Beiping is from April to September, with the highest incidence in June and July. The situation and treatment of bacillary dysentery in children are briefly introduced below:

This disease mostly occurs in poor children because their environmental hygiene is poor, they are usually malnourished with low resistance, and their living conditions are crowded, making transmission easier. Therefore, several cases are often found in one family.

The main symptoms are fever and frequent bowel movements with blood in the stool. The symptoms can be roughly divided into four types:

The first type: acute toxic type. Patients suddenly develop a high fever, with temperatures mostly around 40 degrees Celsius. This is followed by various toxic symptoms such as vomiting and symptoms involving the central nervous system, such as coma and delirium. Convulsions are more common in infants and younger children. These symptoms are mostly caused by the absorption of bacterial toxins in the body and are often mistaken for encephalitis or meningitis. This is especially true because epidemic encephalitis was prevalent in Beiping in 1946 and 1948, making it difficult to distinguish from this type of toxic dysentery, because this disease often does not have purulent stools at the beginning. Purulent stools often appear several hours or one or two days after the onset of the disease. Before purulent stools are found, lumbar puncture may be necessary for differential diagnosis if there are convulsive phenomena. In addition to the above symptoms, the number of bowel movements gradually increases 12 to 24 hours after the onset of the disease, often reaching 30-40 times. This can lead to acute dehydration, such as dry skin losing elasticity, sunken eyes, depressed fontanelle, sunken abdomen, decreased urination, and even changes in breathing showing acidosis. If there is abdominal distension and the number of bowel movements suddenly decreases, it indicates a serious condition. The mortality rate of this type is high, and if not treated early, death often occurs within the first 24 hours or a few days after the onset of the disease.

The second type: ordinary type, the most common. The onset is acute, with a fever of 38 degrees (C) to 40 degrees (C), and sometimes mild meningeal irritation can be seen. At the beginning of the disease, there are often frequent watery stools. Six to twenty-four hours later, blood and pus are found in the stool. Bowel movements occur more than ten times a day, often accompanied by abdominal pain and tenesmus. If not treated early, dehydration can be seen. These acute symptoms last for about five to ten days, after which the body temperature gradually decreases, and the number of bowel movements and the amount of pus also decrease.

The third type: mild type. There are mostly no systemic symptoms, the number of bowel movements is slightly increased, five or six times a day, and the stool contains only a small amount of pus, mostly only mucus is seen.

The fourth type: chronic type. It often lasts for several weeks or even months. The body temperature is mostly normal or only slightly elevated. The stool contains a large amount of mucus, occasionally pus and blood. Weight loss and various nutritional deficiencies follow, the most common being malnutrition edema and vitamin A deficiency (conjunctival xerosis, corneal softening and even perforation). In addition, secondary malnutrition anemia is also common.

The treatment is mainly divided into three types: (1) preventing dehydration, (2) diet therapy, and (3) drug therapy.

(1) Preventing dehydration: If there are no severe vomiting and dehydration, then give a large amount of fluids orally. If accompanied by vomiting and dehydration, inject physiological saline, glucose, plasma, blood, etc.

(2) Diet therapy: If there is high fever, vomiting and other toxic symptoms, it is necessary to stop eating for one or two days. If there are no toxic symptoms, only reduce foods that are difficult to digest. For patients who have been sick for a long time, try to maintain their heat supply to prevent them from losing too much weight. At all times, attention must be paid to the supply of various vitamins, especially vitamin A, because eye dryness is very common.

(3) Drug therapy: In recent years, due to the application of sulfa drugs, the mortality rate of bacillary dysentery has been greatly reduced. If treatment can be started early within the first three days of infection, the results will be even more satisfactory. Patients with early treatment of acute toxic type and patients with ordinary type will see obvious effects after taking a sufficient amount of sulfathiazole for 24 hours. The body temperature often drops sharply first, and returns to normal temperature on the second day of treatment. The number of bowel movements and the pus contained gradually decrease. Mild cases can be cured in two or three days, and severe cases can return to normal in only one or two weeks.

Editor's Note

1. Since the beginning of the publication of "Hygiene", there are still many shortcomings in the collection and arrangement of manuscripts and the selection of content. We sincerely hope that medical and health colleagues and comrades who care about this journal will provide more assistance and construction to make this journal more perfect.

2. This journal welcomes manuscripts related to hygiene, and particularly solicits suggestions and constructions, introductions of experience, and translations of manuscripts on factory hygiene, labor protection, and social insurance as the focus of the next issue. The third issue will focus on maternal and child health. Please pay attention to this when writing.

3. A hygiene Q&A column will be added in the next issue. If there are Q&A manuscripts related to the general public, we will answer them publicly in the newspaper. We also hope that those who ask questions will write down their mailing address so that we can reply in writing. May 22.

　　夏季流行病之一——痢疾
    随着炎热的夏天，可怕的杆菌痢疾又在流行了，今年流行较早，由四月初即开始，至五月初病发数渐渐多了起来。根据儿童医院近数日之统计，杆菌痢疾患者约占病人总数２０％左右（每日二百左右患者中有四十左右为痢疾患者）。此种发病率至六、七两月将继续增多。由此可以推测北平市内之杆菌痢疾患者至少有千余人。因此杆菌痢疾之流行在北平实在是一件很严重的问题，是值得医学界注意的。
    杆菌痢疾在北平流行之时间由四月至九月，以六、七两月最多。现将杆菌痢疾发生于儿童之情形及疗法简单介绍如下：
    此种病多发生在贫苦之儿童中，因其环境卫生较差，平时营养不良抵抗力较低，且住处拥挤传播较易，故常于一个家庭中发见数例。
    其症状主要为发热，大便频数，便中带血。症状大致可分为四型：
    第一型：急性中毒型，患者突然发生高热，热度多在摄氏四○度左右。继之有各种中毒现象如呕吐及有涉于神经中枢之症状，如昏迷、谵妄，在婴儿及年龄较小之儿童更常见有惊厥现象。此等症状大多因体内吸收细菌之毒素所致，常误为脑炎或脑膜炎；尤以一九四六及一九四八两年北平流行大脑炎，时与此种中素性痢疾不易区别，因为此病起始时往往无脓性大便。脓性之大便常于发病后数小时或一、二日始见。在发现脓性大便以前，如有痉挛现象为鉴别起见，偶有腰椎穿刺之必要。除以上之症状外，大便次数于发病十二小时至二十四小时后渐次增多。每多至三十—四十次左右，因此可以发生急性脱水现象；如皮肤干燥失去弹性，眼部凹伏前囱低落，腹部凹缩，小便减少，甚至呼吸改变呈酸中毒现象，若有腹部膨胀大便次数忽然减少，则表示严重，此型之死亡率较高，若不早期治疗，常于发病起始之二十四小时内或数日后死亡。
    第二型：普通型，最常见者，发病急，有热三十八度（Ｃ）至四十度（Ｃ），有时可见轻度之脑膜刺激现象。发病之始，常有频数水样便，于六至二十四小时后，于大便中即有血液及脓液发现，大便每日十数次，常伴有腹痛及里急后重等现象，若不早期治疗，则可见脱水现象，此种急性症状持续五至十日左右，此后体温渐次下降，大便次数渐减少脓液亦减。
    第三型：轻度型，多无全身症状，大便次数稍加多，每日五、六次，大便中仅含少量脓液，大多只见粘液。
    第四型：慢性型，常持续数星期以至数月，体温大多正常或仅轻度上升。大便含有大量粘液，偶见脓液及血液，体重减轻，续发各种营养缺乏症，最多者为营养不良性水肿及甲种维生素缺乏症（结膜干燥，角膜软化以至穿孔），此外续发性营养不良性贫血亦不少见。
    疗法主要分三种：（一）防止脱水（二）饮食疗法（三）药物疗法。
    （一）防止脱水：若无严重之呕吐及脱水现象，则口授大量液体，若伴有呕吐及脱水现象，则注射生理盐水、葡萄糖、血浆、血液等。
    （二）饮食疗法：如有高热，呕吐及其它中毒现象者，须实行停食一、二日，如无中毒现象则仅减去难于消化之食物，对于久病之患者，尽则力维持其热力之供给，不使消瘦过甚。无论何时各种维生素之供给必需常加注意，尤以甲种维生素最为重要，因眼干燥病非常多见之故。
    （三）药物疗法：近数年来由于矿胺剂之应用，杆菌痢疾之死亡率大为减少，若能在本症感染最初三日内及早治疗，结果尤为美满，急性中毒型之早期治疗者及普通型之患者，服用足量之磺胺噻唑于二十四小时后则见著效，大多体温先作急骤之下降，于治疗之第二日即可还于常温，大便次数及所含脓液渐渐减少，轻者二、三日即可痊愈，重者只须一、二星期即可恢复正常。
