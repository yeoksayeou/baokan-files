Education in the Entire Yuan Empire is Like This
Wang Pu

Let us take a look at the United States, which boasts of having the most "developed" education, and see to what extent its education is actually "developed."

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Benton once admitted that before World War II, U.S. public education expenditure accounted for 3 percent of national income, but after the war, it dropped to 1.5 percent. Post-war military spending has increased dramatically, while education funding has been drastically reduced. The neglect of education by the U.S. imperial capitalist system has led to a serious crisis in the entire U.S. education system, a fact unanimously acknowledged by famous U.S. educators!

First, let's look at the situation of illiteracy. The New York Times reported that six million American children, or one-fifth of school-age children, cannot attend school. U.S. Attorney General Clark also admitted that in addition to these out-of-school children, two million American children attend very unsatisfactory schools, three million adults have never been to school, and ten million have received very inadequate education and are in fact illiterate. Doesn't the United States claim to have a system of compulsory education? Why are there so many illiterates? Perhaps the beautiful words are written in the bourgeois constitution, but in fact, the laws of seventeen U.S. states allow children who are too poor not to attend school, and another twenty-two states allow children who live too far from school not to study. This is the so-called "compulsory education" in the United States!

Even American children who can attend school cannot receive a perfect education, as can be understood from the frequent calls in American public opinion to close those thousands of schools that are underfunded, have simple school buildings, and lack equipment. No wonder Dr. Feign joked: "American schools are fortunate not to have suffered war damage, but they look like they have been bombed by heavy bombs!"

This year, the United States lacks 1.5 million teachers, which is also a serious problem. Why is this so? The average salary for U.S. teachers is $37 per week, but the minimum cost of living for a small family is $75 per week. Moreover, due to inflation and other reasons, teachers' incomes are decreasing day by day. The current real wages of teachers are 20 percent lower than in 1940. Who wants to do teaching work and live such a life? Since 1940, 350,000 teachers in the United States have changed careers.

In the United States, there are people who receive even worse education than this? The 10 percent of Americans who are Black have their right to education even more severely deprived. Educator Weston said that the U.S. education system for Black people is an institution for creating illiterates. Black illiteracy is 14 percent, and those who have received some "education" but are in fact still illiterate account for 40 percent. The situation of Indians and other people of color is much worse than this.

From the above situation, we can know why under the capitalist system, Americans spend an average of $19 per person per year on smoking, $51 on drinking, and only $17 on education. This is the education of the "gold dollar empire"!

    全元帝国的教育是这样的
    王朴
    让我们来看一看这个自诩为教育最“发达”的美国，它的教育究竟“发达”到怎样的程度吧？
    美国副国务卿班顿曾承认，在第二次世界大战以前，美国公共教育的经费占国民收入百分之三，战争之后便下降到百分之一点五了。战后的军费比战前大增特增，而教育经费却大减特减。美国帝国资本主义制度对教育之忽视，乃使目前美国整个教育制度是陷于严重的危机中，这是美国有名的教育家所一致承认的事实！
    首先，我们从文盲的情况来看，纽约时报曾报道称，六百万美国儿童，即五分之一的学龄儿童不能进学校。美国司法部长克拉克也承认，除了这些失学儿童之外，还有二百万美国儿童进了非常令人不满的学校，三百万成年人从未念过书，还有一千万人受过非常不够的教育，事实上还是文盲。美国不是说实行了强迫教育的制度吗？为什么还有这么多文盲呢？也许资产阶级的宪法上写着美丽的字句，但是事实上，美国有十七个州的法律准许太穷苦的儿童可以不进学校，另外二十二个州则准许住得离学校太远的儿童可以不要读书。这就是美国的所谓“强迫教育”！
    即使能进学校的美国儿童，也不能受到完善的教育，这从美国舆论经常呼吁停办那几千所经费不足，校舍简陋，设备缺乏的学校，便可以理解到了。怪不得费恩博士要开这样的玩笑：“美国的学校侥幸没有遭受战争的损害，可是看起来就象给重磅炸弹炸过的一样！”
    今年美国缺少一百五十万个教员，这亦是一个严重问题。为什么会这样呢？美国教员平均薪金每周三十七元，但是一个小家庭每周最低生活费是七十五元，而且由于通货膨胀等原因，教员收入日渐减少，目前教员的实际工资比一九四○年已降低了百分之二十。教书的要过这样的生活谁愿干呢？自一九四○年以来，美国已经有了三十五万教员转业了。
    在美国，受着比这还不如的教育的人还有着呢？占百分之十的美国黑人，他们受教育的权利是更厉害地被剥夺了。教育家西敦说，美国黑人的教育制度是制造文盲的机构。黑人文盲占百分之十四，受过点“教育”而事实上还是文盲的占百分之四十。印第安人和别的有色人种的情形比这还要差得多。
    从上面的情形看来，我们便可以知道为什么在资本主义制度之下，美国人平均每年每人花十九元去抽烟，花五十一元去喝酒，而只用十七元于教育上。这就是“金元帝国”的教育呀！
