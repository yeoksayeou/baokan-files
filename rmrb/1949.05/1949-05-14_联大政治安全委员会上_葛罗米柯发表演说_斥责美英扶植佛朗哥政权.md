Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: New York dispatch: Gromyko, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a lengthy speech on the Franco Spain issue at the UN Political and Security Committee on May 6.

Gromyko first traced the background of the United Nations' review of the Franco fascist regime issue, pointing out that the United Nations has paid attention to this matter since its establishment. The United Nations has not only morally and politically condemned the Franco regime, but has also adopted resolutions to change the situation in Spain and establish a democratic system in Spain. However, although the United Nations has repeatedly discussed the Franco regime issue, and although specific measures have been adopted, the United Nations still has to discuss this issue again at each session. What is the reason? The reason lies in the failure to implement the resolutions of the San Francisco Conference, the three Potsdam Conferences, and the UN General Assembly in 1946 and 1947.

The United Nations verbally condemned the Franco regime, but in fact proved powerless to implement its own resolutions. This situation is not accidental. This is because some countries, primarily the United States and Britain, have been trying to prevent the implementation of the resolutions that have already been passed. At the last session of the UN General Assembly, the US representative took a position sympathetic to Franco and supported Franco. The US delegation only agreed to measures against the Franco regime to the extent necessary to satisfy American public opinion. However, the delegation resisted any proposals that were more effective than those passed by the UN General Assembly in 1946 and 1947. Whether in the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly, the United States government has in fact supported the Franco regime. As soon as the work of the 1946 UN General Assembly ended, the United States turned to strengthening its assistance to Franco Spain and obstructing the resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly. This position is not surprising, because the governments of these countries have sought from the beginning to preserve Spain as a hotbed of fascism. At that time, the British and French rulers helped Hitler's Germany and fascist Italy strangle the Spanish Republic with their notorious policy of "non-intervention" in Spanish affairs. Now, Britain and the United States are repeating their old tune, talking about "non-interference" in Spain's internal affairs on the one hand, while helping the Franco fascist regime on the other.

Gromyko cited many facts, powerfully pointing out that Spain is being transformed into a military colony of the United States and Britain, and the Spanish economy is serving the interests of American monopoly capital. The French government is not far behind in this policy; it has expanded trade with Franco Spain and signed economic agreements with it. The governments of Argentina, Belgium, and the Netherlands are also acting in the same way. The US and British ruling blocs are also formulating far-reaching strategic calculations regarding Spain and the entire Iberian Peninsula. Many American politicians have openly pointed out that the US government and the US military should turn Spain into a military and strategic springboard for use in the future war that the US-British aggressive bloc is preparing. What is noteworthy in this regard are the visits to Madrid and consultations with Franco by US officials, semi-official personnel, and non-official personnel. These visits and trips are followed by very practical things. The United States has obtained from Franco the right to manage Spanish airlines. It has established a large network of airports in Spain. The US ruling bloc, as in other countries, is increasingly seizing Spanish raw materials. Western newspapers recently reported that the United States has agreed with Franco to lease the island of Minorca (located in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean) for 25 years, and the United States has the right to establish naval bases and airports in the archipelago. US missions are training Spanish aviators. A naval mission guiding the reconstruction of Spanish ports has intensified its activities in Spain. The United States is undertaking in Franco Spain the work of restoring the local German war industry with equipment imported from West Germany. In the spring of 1948, American newspapers reported that Truman's personal representative to the Vatican, Taylor, had discussed with Franco the issue of "Spain's position in the event of a war between East and West." These are some facts illustrating the attitude of the United States and Britain towards the Franco fascist regime.

Gromyko pointed out that the above facts prove with irrefutable logic that the United States and Britain have made it their goal to prevent the abolition of the Franco fascist regime and maintain the Franco clique in Spain. The UN General Assembly must not merely record these facts. The task of the United Nations is to stop the policy of condoning and encouraging fascist regimes that aggressive blocs in some countries are beginning to pursue with increasing determination. The United Nations must not only ensure the implementation of the resolutions that the UN General Assembly has already passed, but must also consider what methods should be used to achieve the victory of democracy in Spain and to secure for the Spanish people their rightful place in the United Nations.

    联大政治安全委员会上
    葛罗米柯发表演说
    斥责美英扶植佛朗哥政权
    【新华社北平十三日电】纽约讯：苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长葛罗米柯，五月六日就佛朗哥西班牙问题在联大政治安全委员会发表长篇演说。
    葛罗米柯首先追溯联合国审议佛朗哥法西斯政权问题的背景，指出联合国自成立以来便注意这一件事。联合国不仅在道义上和政治上斥责过佛朗哥政权，而且通过了决议，以便改变西班牙的形势，在西班牙建立民主制度。但是，虽然联合国一再讨论了佛朗哥政权问题，虽然通过了具体的措施，而联合国仍然在每届会议上都不得不再度讨论这一问题。其原因何在呢？原因在于不履行旧金山会议，三次波茨坦会议以及一九四六年、一九四七年联大的决议。
    联合国在文字上斥责佛朗哥政权，而事实上证明无力把自己的决议付诸实施。这种局势并非偶然的。这是由于某些国家首先是美国和英国竭力阻止实现已经通过的决议。在联大上次会议上，美国代表采取同情佛朗哥的立场，支持佛朗哥。美国代表团只是在满足美国舆论所必须的限度内赞同对付佛朗哥政权的措施。然而，该代表团抵抗任何比较一九四六年与一九四七年联大所通过的有效的提议。不论在安理会和联合国大会上，美国政府实际上都支持佛朗哥政权。一九四六年联大的工作刚告结束，美国使已转而加强对佛朗哥西班牙的援助，阻挠联大所通过的决议。这种立场是不稀奇的，因为这些国家的政府自始便力谋保存西班牙作为法西斯的温床。在那个时候，英法统治者便曾以他们臭名远扬的对西班牙事务的“不干涉”政策来帮助希特勒德国和法西斯意大利绞杀西班牙共和国。现在，英国和美国又重弹老调，一面高谈“不干涉”西班牙内政，一面却帮助佛朗哥法西斯政权。
    葛罗米柯而举出许多事实，有力地指明西班牙转化为美国和英国的军事殖民地，西班牙的经济正在为美国垄断资本的利益服务。法国政府在这个政策上也不甘落后，它已扩大与佛朗哥西班牙的贸易，并与它订立经济协定，阿根廷、比利时、荷兰的政府也同样行事。美英统治集团并且正在制订关于西班牙及整个伊比利安半岛的深远的战略盘算。美国许多政治家公开指出，美国政府及美国军队应该把西班牙变为军事及战略跳板，以便在美英侵略集团正在从事准备的未来战争中使用。这一方面值得注意的，是美国官方半官方及非官方人员的访问马德里以及与佛朗哥的商谈。在这些访问与旅行之后，紧跟着就是十分实际的事情。美国已自佛朗哥那里取得经管西班牙航空线的权利。它已在西班牙建立了大飞机场网。美国统治集团正如在其他国家一样，越来越扩大地攫取西班牙的原料。西方国家报章最近报道，美国已与佛朗哥商妥，租用密诺卡岛（此岛在地中海上巴利阿利群岛之中）二十五年，美国有权在该群岛建立海军基地和机场。美国的使团正在训练西班牙的航空员。指导西班牙港口重建事宜的海军使团，已在西班牙加紧形动。美国在佛朗哥西班牙承担着以自西德输入的装备恢复当地德国战争工业的工作。一九四八年春，美国报纸报道，杜鲁门驻梵蒂冈私人代表戴勒，曾与佛朗哥商谈“一旦东西双方战争爆发时西班牙的地位”问题。这些就是说明美国和英国对于佛朗哥法西斯政权的态度的一些事实。
    葛罗米柯指出，上述事实以无可反驳的逻辑证明美国和英国已经以阻止废除佛朗哥法西斯政权并在西班牙保持佛朗哥集团为其目的。联大必须不仅仅记录这些事实而已。联合国的任务，应在于制止某些国家的侵略集团正在开始以越来越大的决心进行的纵容与鼓励法西斯政权的政策。联合国不仅仅必须保证履行联大所已通过的决议案，而且必须深思应该用什么方法在西班牙达成民主的胜利，并为西班牙人民在联合国中取得其应有的地位。
