　　Using Scrap Iron to Create New Products: Railway Machinery Plants Increase Productivity
　　Northern Factories Conference Reports on Production Work
　　[Our Newspaper's News] Yesterday (the 24th) was the second day of the Northern Factories Conference. In the morning, a general meeting was held to hear work reports from the Tangshan Machinery Plant and the Changxindian Machinery Plant. In the afternoon, the representatives held group discussions. The general meeting began at 8:00 AM. First, the Deputy Director of the Tangshan Machinery Plant reported that the enthusiasm and creativity of the factory workers had greatly improved. They were making extensive use of waste materials, overcoming material difficulties, creating new products, and increasing production efficiency. He said: Since the factory put forward the slogan "Scrap Iron Makes a Great Comeback," they have found 128 tons of iron materials and scrap iron, originally planned to require 200 workers to find, but actually only used 154 workers. Due to the high level of work enthusiasm of the staff, the factory has now created more than ten kinds of products, the main ones being: cast iron wheels, independent automatic driver valves, half-centimeter small drill bits, water-based gas, pneumatic drills, cast iron solder, electric welding machines, kerosene gas cutters, terrazzo, etc. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, these creations were all imported from abroad, but now they can be made by themselves. In April, the factory staff greatly improved production efficiency by means of production competitions. For example, the tool workshop previously filed 5,000 inches of files per month, but now it has increased to 10,000 inches per month, doubling the amount. The car body workshop used to take 1,600 workers to repair burned-out passenger cars, but now it only takes 900 workers to repair them; the forging workshop used to produce 40 track bolts per worker, but now the highest record is 110 bolts per worker; the repair shop used to take 25 workers to install passenger car heating pipes in February, 22 workers in March, and only 12 workers in April; the reconstruction of car steam pipes used to take 150 workers in February, but it was reduced to 100 workers in March. Then, the Deputy Director of the Changxindian Machinery Plant reported on the work of the Changxindian Machinery Plant: There have also been many achievements in improving the manufacturing and work efficiency of the factory: for example, all vertical boilers are now electrically welded, with the original pressure of 11 kilograms, now experimentally improved to 22 kilograms; in the manufacture of ferrosilicon for steelmaking, the sand content was previously 20% to 30%, but now it has been improved to about 50%; the original lining was alkaline, but now carbon rods are used as lining. Due to the increase in silicon content, both time and raw materials have been greatly saved. In addition, the self-made anemometers, steam meters, bridge turntables, carbon rods, etc. have been successful. Important achievements have also been made in the utilization of scrap iron, such as using scrap iron to remelt steel ingots and steel bars. In terms of improving work efficiency: A sudden rush to produce 10,000 track bolts was completed as scheduled within a week. When making track bolts, one shift used to make 600 bolts per day, but now they make 2,000 bolts; drilling holes used to be done by one person with one machine, drilling 150 holes per day, but now it has been increased to 600 holes. When reviewing the shortcomings in the work, everyone believed that the main shortcomings in the work were the lack of planning in production, and some plans were not practical. The supply of materials was not timely enough, and the organization of production capacity was not precise or scientific enough, so that the effectiveness of production work could not be fully and comprehensively realized. Some people are too busy, while others have nothing to do. In the future, we must improve the planning of work and strictly establish a responsibility system. We must do our best to solve the supply of main production materials, develop a hard-working and thrifty style, make use of waste materials, practice economy, and give greater play to the spirit of creation, repair a large number of damaged locomotives, and overcome various difficulties to ensure the successful completion of the work. In the afternoon, the representatives of each factory continued to make supplementary speeches, and then moved into group discussions.

　　利用废铁创造新产品  铁路机厂提高生产率
    北方厂务会议报告生产工作
    【本报讯】昨（二十四）日为北方厂务会议第二日。上午举行大会，听取唐山机厂及长辛店机厂工作报告，下午各代表分组讨论。八时大会开始，首由唐山机厂副厂长报告该厂工友积极性与创造性已大为提高，多方利用废物，克服材料困难，创造新产品，提高生产效率等情形。他说：该厂自提出“废铁大翻身”口号以后，从废铁中寻出铁料及乱铁一百二十八吨，原计划需二百个工寻出，但实际只用了一百五十四个工。由于职工同志高度发挥了工作热情，现在该厂创造品已达十余种以上，其中主要者有：生铁轮、单独自动司机阀、半个糎小钻头、水性瓦斯、风钻、生铁焊药、电焊机、火油瓦斯切断器、水磨石等。这些创造品过去在国民党统治时代，都是依靠外国运来的，现在已能自制了。在四月份里，该厂职工用生产竞赛的方式，大大地提高了生产效率。如象工具所伐锉刀，以往每月伐五千英寸，现在每月增加到一万英寸，增加了一倍。车架所修理被火烧毁的客车，以往要用一千六百个工，现在只用九百工就能修理好；锻工所打道夹板以往每工四十块，现在每工最高纪录已达一一○块；修配所装客车暖气管子，二月份一辆要二十五个工，三月份要二十二工，四月份就减到了十二个工；重造车汽管，二月份需一五○个工，三月份已减至一百个工。继由长辛店机厂副厂长报告长辛店机厂工作：在该厂的制造及工作效力提高上，亦有很多成绩：如立式锅炉全部电焊，原压力十一公斤，现在试验改进到二十二公斤；制造作炼钢用的矽铁，从前砂的成份为百分之二十到三十，现在改进到百分之五十左右，原来是碱性衬里，现在改用炭精棒作衬里，由于矽的成份增加，时间与原料都有很大节省。此外如自制风表、汽表、架桥的转盘、炭精棒等已经成功。在利用废铁方面，亦获重要成绩，如利用废铁回炉制造钢锭、钢条等。在工作效力提高上：突击一万块道夹板，一礼拜以内如期完成，打道夹板时，从前一班人每天六百块，现在作到二千块；钻眼以前每人一个机器一天能钻一百五十眼，现在提高到六百眼。在检讨工作中的缺点时，大家认为：工作中的主要缺点是生产缺乏计划性，有些计划也不切合实际。材料供给不够及时，生产能力组织也不够精密科学，以致未能高度全面发挥生产工作效能。有的太忙，有的又没有事做。今后必须提高工作计划性，严格建立负责制。尽力解决主要生产材料的供给，发挥刻苦兴家的作风，利用废物，厉行节约，更高度的发挥创造精神，大量修复破损机车，克服各种困难，以保证工作的胜利完成。午后各厂代表继续作补充发言后，即转入分组讨论。
