As a result of the election, 175 people were elected as members of the Central Committee of the Soviet Trade Union, 57 people were elected as alternate members of the Central Committee, and 17 people were elected as members of the Supervisory Committee.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: TASS Rome dispatch: Togliatti recently delivered a long speech in Turin, analyzing the Italian economic situation one year after the Christian Democratic government of Gasperi came to power. He pointed out: Despite the much-touted "aid" of the so-called Marshall Plan, Italy's industrial production has still not exceeded the 1938 level, and according to the most daring estimates is still 15 percent lower than the aforementioned level. The unemployment situation is particularly alarming. In the year from January 1948 to January 1949, the number of unemployed in Italy increased by 39 percent, reaching as high as 2.16 million in early 1949. The people are becoming poorer and poorer.
