【Taiyuan Electricity】The workers of Taiyuan City, who have long suffered from the oppression of the Yan clique, have received relief from the People's Government. The Taiyuan Military Control Commission decided on the 25th to allocate another 900,000 jin of millet to universally provide relief to workers in various factories in the city who are experiencing financial difficulties, as well as unemployed workers and lower-level staff in those factories. The principle of relief is 30 jin of millet per person, but it can be slightly increased or decreased depending on the size of the family and the circumstances.
