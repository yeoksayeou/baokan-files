    Northern China Organizes Doctors to Fight Epidemics with All Efforts
    Prevailing Epidemics Gradually Suppressed
    Over 400,000 People Vaccinated with Cowpox and Given Injections in the Entire Region

    [Report from this newspaper] This spring, about 400,000 people in Northern China were vaccinated against diseases, and the prevailing smallpox epidemic is gradually being suppressed. Since the beginning of spring, epidemic diseases such as pestilence, smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, and cholera have occurred successively in Taihang, Central Hebei, Central Shanxi, Eastern Hebei, Chahar, and Shijiazhuang. In the Youding Village area of Wutai in Central Shanxi alone, more than 490 people contracted smallpox, and more than 50 died. In Taopo Village, Pingding County, more than 130 people in 100 households suffered from smallpox and measles. In Tongxian and Sanhe in Eastern Hebei, the number of deaths due to smallpox and measles reached 971. It is estimated that epidemics were prevalent in 14 counties in Taihang and 12 counties in Central Hebei. The Taihang Administrative Office took urgent measures to deal with this epidemic: purchasing a large number of vaccines and preventive injections, and distributing them to various special counties according to the different conditions of smallpox and epidemic diseases, which could be used to inoculate more than 327,000 people. Chinese and Western doctors in various special counties were organized to divide the epidemic areas, carry out vaccinations and treatment of other diseases in villages, and conduct hygiene inspections. The masses were educated to strictly isolate, so that the spread of smallpox and measles was quickly stopped. Medical workers in Taihang used various occasions to carry out mass health and epidemic prevention publicity in rural areas. More than 30 medical personnel in Licheng County used temple fairs to organize drug associations, hold health exhibitions, explain the sources of diseases, conditions, and prevention methods to the masses, publicizing to more than 13,000 people and treating more than 800 people. When epidemic diseases were discovered in Central Shanxi and other places, Chinese and Western doctors were organized into shock teams to travel to various places for treatment, and more than 15,000 people were given preventive injections. After the discovery of epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles in Tongxian and Sanhe in Eastern Hebei, 16 epidemic prevention teams were organized to inject and vaccinate more than 33,000 people with cowpox in the epidemic areas. In Shijiazhuang, epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles were discovered this spring, and two large teams of doctors were immediately organized, one team for each street, and each street had a group. By the end of March 17, more than 48,000 people had been vaccinated. In Tongxian and Sanhe in Eastern Hebei, ten teams went to prevent epidemics, and the epidemic no longer spread by May 1. When a plague occurred in Chicheng, Chahar, the Ministry of Health of the North China People's Government immediately sent an epidemic prevention team to quickly suppress it. 222 people were given preventive injections and more than 3,000 people were vaccinated in Chicheng.

    Although initial achievements have been made in health work, there are still some shortcomings: 1. There is no sound leadership organization and strong cadres. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in health work. 2. Insufficient attention from the leadership, failure to promptly supervise and inspect local health work, resulting in the inability to quickly suppress infectious diseases. 3. Insufficient coordination between health work and other work, making health work isolated. 4. There is a phenomenon of mutual contempt and disunity between Chinese and Western doctors in treatment. Cadres should strengthen education for Chinese and Western doctors, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and establish the concept of serving the people.

    华北各地组织医生全力防治
    流行疫病逐渐扑灭
    全区种牛痘注射防疫针者四十余万人
    【本报讯】华北各地今春约有四十余万人种痘防疫，流行的天花瘟疫逐渐扑灭。入春以来，太行、冀中、晋中、冀东、察哈尔、石家庄市等地相继发生流行性的瘟疫、天花、麻疹、猩红热、霍乱等病。仅在晋中的五台尤丁村一带，患天花者即有四百九十余人，死去五十余人。平定县桃坡村一百户人家，患天花、麻疹的即有一百三十余人。冀东通县、三河因天花麻疹两种病而死亡人数达九百七十一人。太行估计有十四个县，冀中有十二个县普遍流行。太行行署对此流行病曾采取了紧急的措施：购买大批痘苗与预防针，根据天花及流行病的不同情况分发给各专县，可种三十二万七千余人。各专县中西医生组织起来，划分疫区，分村进行种痘与其他病症的治疗，并进行卫生工作的检查。教育群众严格隔离，使天花麻疹病很快的停止了蔓延。太行医务工作者利用各种场合开展农村群众性的卫生防疫宣传，黎城县三十余医务人员利用庙会组织了药社，进行卫生展览，给群众讲解病源病情及防疫的方法，宣传了一万三千余群众，治疗了八百余人。晋中等地当发现流行病时，即组织中西医生突击组到各地巡回治疗，实行防疫注射有一万五千余人。冀东的通县三河发现天花麻疹等流行病后，即组织了十六个防疫小组在疫区注射及种牛痘三万三千余人。石家庄今春曾发现了天花麻疹等流行病，当即组织医生两个大队，每个街一个小组，至三月十七日结束，种痘四万八千余人。冀东之通县三河有十个组分路前去防疫，至五月一日流行病亦不再蔓延。当察哈尔赤城发生瘟疫时，华北人民政府卫生部即派防疫队前去迅速扑灭，在赤城防疫注射的二百二十二人，种痘的三千余人。
    在卫生工作中虽获有初步成绩，但还存在着某些缺点：一、没有健全的领导机构与强有力的干部。因此在卫生工作上还存在不少的困难。二、领导上的注视不够，没有及时的督促与检查当地卫生工作，致使传染病不能很快的扑灭。三、卫生工作与其他工作配合不够，使卫生工作孤立进行。四、中西医生在治疗上有互相轻视、不团结的现象，干部应对中西医生加强教育，互相取长补短，树立为人民服务的观点。
