　　Tongzhou Business Tax Collection Reaches Ninety Percent
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The industrial and commercial sectors of Tongzhou City are actively paying business taxes. As of the 18th of this month, 92 percent has been paid. In this payment, most merchants have achieved accurate reporting and prompt payment, changing the bad habits of bribery, false reporting, and delays that existed during the enemy and puppet regime. The main reasons for the enthusiastic payment of business tax in the city this time are: First, before the tax was levied, the tax bureau used various meetings to explain tax policies and publicize the victorious situation and construction tasks, so that general merchants understood that the government's tax revenue was used for supporting the front and construction, completely different from the enemy and puppet regime. Second, ideological education was conducted for tax cadres before the levy, and cadres from various agencies were drawn together for unified levy, so that a few cunning merchants had no loopholes to exploit. Third, the system of democratic self-reporting and public discussion by taxpayers was implemented. After each household's declaration, it was publicly discussed by the street, and finally a public notice review was conducted, exposing false reports and commending active taxpayers, which generally achieved fairness and reasonableness.

　　通州营业税已征起九成
    【本报讯】通州市工商各业踊跃缴纳营业税。至本月十八日止，已缴百分之九十二。此次缴款中，大多商户做到了实报快缴，改变了过去敌伪时期的贿赂、虚报、拖延等恶习。该市此次营业税缴纳踊跃的主要原因是：一、税局在开征前曾利用各种会议讲解税收政策，宣传胜利形势与建设的任务，一般商户了解了政府税收用途是支前、建设、完全与敌伪不同。二、征收前对税收干部进行了思想教育，抽集各机关干部进行了统一征收，使少数奸滑商户无空可钻。三、实行了缴税者民主自报公议，各户申报后，以街公议，最后公告审查，揭露假报，表扬积极缴纳户，大体做到了公平合理。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（坚）
