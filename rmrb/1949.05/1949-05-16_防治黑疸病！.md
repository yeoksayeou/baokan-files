　　Prevent Wheat Bunt!
　　Wheat bunt is a specific disease of wheat. A spoiled kernel of bunt wheat, when crushed, turns into black powder. Each kernel contains over ten thousand tiny black spores. Each spore, if it lands on a wheat seedling, can grow into a black head. Normally, a good kernel of wheat has hairs and grooves. If the black spores are hidden in the hairs and grooves of a good kernel, they are invisible to the naked eye. If a wheat kernel carries black spores, the wheat that grows from it will definitely be affected. These small black spores cannot grow on their own, nor can they rely on other crops. They can only grow by parasitizing wheat. When a good wheat kernel carrying black spores is sown in the ground, the wheat kernel germinates, and the black spores also germinate. As the wheat kernel grows into a seedling, the spores grow into fine threads. Some of these threads burrow into the wheat root, and some burrow into the wheat stalk. As the wheat seedling grows, the threads also grow along the wheat stem. When the wheat seedling produces ears, these threads occupy the ears. Finally, in the place where wheat kernels should grow, they completely form black spores by using the nutrients of the wheat seedling, turning the wheat entirely into black heads. Before the wheat harvest, if some of the black heads mature, the black powder will spread to other wheat ears in the wind, and the infection can spread very quickly. Within a few days, it can ruin all the wheat. Therefore, when black bunt wheat is first discovered, it is best to pull it out quickly to prevent it from maturing and infecting other wheat. The difference between bunt wheat and good wheat is: the stalk of wheat without bunt disease is straight and strong, the leaves are green, and the kernels are full and whitish. Wheat with bunt disease has a curved stalk, black powder on the leaves, or even gray-black color, and there are obvious black spots on the kernels, and the awns are burst. All localities should take advantage of the fact that the wheat is not yet ripe and quickly check the fields. If this bunt disease is found, immediately pull out the wheat with bunt disease, otherwise the spread of bunt disease will inevitably affect the wheat harvest.

　　防治黑疸病！
    黑疸病是麦子的一种特殊病症，一个坏了的黑麦籽，用手一捻，就成了黑面面、一颗黑麦籽里，就有一万多个很小的黑胞子，每一个黑胞子，只要生到麦苗上，都能长成一个黑穗子。平常一颗好的麦子，上面有毛、也有沟，假若黑胞子藏在好麦籽的毛里沟里，人的肉眼是看不见的，麦籽只要带上黑胞子，将来长成的麦，就一定要受害。这种小的黑胞子，自己不能长，靠别的田禾也不行，只有靠寄生在麦子上，才能生长。好的麦籽带上黑胞子，种在地里，麦籽发芽，黑胞也发芽，麦籽长成了苗，黑胞子的芽就长成了细丝，这些细丝，有的钻到麦根里，有的钻到麦杆里，麦苗长，细丝靠着麦苗的茎，也长起来。在麦苗出了麦穗时，这些细丝就占据了麦穗，最后在长麦籽的地方，借着麦苗的养料，就完全结成了黑胞子，使麦子完全变成了黑穗子。麦收前，假若有的黑穗成熟了，经风一吹，这些黑面面落在别的麦穗上，就能传染起来，而且传染得很快，几天之内，就能使麦子全部坏了。所以当一开始发现黑疸麦子时，最好是赶快拔掉，免得长成熟再传染别的麦子。黑疸麦与好麦子的分别是：没有黑疸病的麦子，麦秆是直的，也肥壮，叶是绿色的，颗粒饱满而带白色。有了黑疸病的麦子，麦杆是曲线的，叶上有黑色粉，甚至成了灰黑色，颗粒上，也有显明的黑点，麦芒是炸的，各地应趁现在麦子不熟的时候，赶快到地里看看如果发生了这种疸病，马上把生黑疸的麦子拔掉，否则黑疸病蔓延起来必将影响麦子的收成。
