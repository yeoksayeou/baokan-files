[Hebei Central News] The Cang City Trade Union neglects the labor movement work in private factories, workshops, and handicrafts. According to statistics from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, there are 658 workers in private factories, workshops, and handicrafts in the city. To this day, they are still universally subjected to illegal exploitation by capitalists using various means. On April 28th and 29th, the reporter visited ten private factories and workshops and found the following common problems: 1. Wages are not fixed and are not paid in full on a monthly basis. For example, the wages at Lihua Pot Casting Factory are not fixed. When workers need money, they borrow dozens or hundreds of yuan, and if they don't use it all, they have to return it to the cashier. The wages at Tongxing Sauce Garden are fixed, and are even planned in terms of goods, but they are not paid in full on a monthly basis. Workers borrow small amounts at irregular intervals, and at the end of the month, the goods are converted into currency and stored with the cashier, illegally exploiting workers by taking advantage of rising prices and currency depreciation. 2. Unreasonable piecework systems and monetary wages are a common means of excessive exploitation of female workers, child laborers, and apprentices. For example, the Dongxing Cigarette Factory employs two female workers and only pays them 30 yuan per day. When the reporter asked if this was enough to maintain their minimum personal living standards, the factory manager said dismissively, "They are just children, and it's not like they have anything else to do at home anyway." It's as if not having enough to eat is a matter of course. Their working hours are at least 13 hours or more. 3. There are no fixed contracts between labor and management. Capitalists hire workers when they are making money, and send them home when they are making less money (or not making any money). Workers have no guarantee of livelihood. For example, Fukang Oil Mill (a government-run producer) laid off all workers because it had more than 10,000 bean cakes that it could not sell. Manager Jiang Yiru said, "We will call them back whenever the bean cakes are sold!" 4. There are problems with worker organization and education. The vast majority of workers have not joined the trade union, and some have nominally joined, but in reality, it is as if they have not. For example, the workers at Dongsheng Oil Mill have not held a single meeting since last year's "May Day." Some still do not know what a trade union is and still view it with the guild mindset of the Middle Ages. Because workers lack education and trade union leadership, they are generally afraid of being fired by capitalists and dare not speak the truth. In response to the above situation: (1) The Cang City Municipal Committee and the Trade Union must quickly convene a forum for representatives of workers and managers from private factories, workshops, and handicrafts. In accordance with the principle of benefiting both labor and management and the spirit of the Labor Resolution, they must resolve issues such as wage standards, working hour principles, employee benefits, and labor discipline, urge labor and management in each factory and workshop to sign contracts, and inspect the implementation of these contracts at any time. (2) The Trade Union must go deep among the workers to understand the situation, organize trade unions, strengthen worker education, and raise the workers' class consciousness.

    沧市忽视私营工厂工运
    工人仍受非法剥削
    市委与职工会应立即检查纠正
    【冀中讯】沧市职工会忽视私营工厂、作坊、手工业的工运工作。根据工商局的统计，该市私营工厂、作坊、手工业共有六百五十八个工人。他们迄今仍普遍地被资本家以各式各样的手段进行非法的剥削。记者于四月二十八、二十九两日访问十个私营工厂、作坊，发现普遍地存在着下列问题：一、工资不规定和不按月发清，如利华铸锅厂的工资就未规定，工人用钱的时候，几十、几百的借支，用不完，仍得交回柜上。同兴酱园的工资是规定了。而且还是以实物计划，但是却不按月发清，平时零星借支，月终结帐后，将实物折成货币存于柜上。利用物价上升，货币贬值而非法剥削工人。二、不合理的包工制和货币工资，这是普遍的对于女工、童工，学徒等过分剥削的方式。如东兴卷烟工厂雇用的两个女工，每天只给工资三十元，当记者问是否能维持个人的最低生活时，该厂经理却轻蔑地说：“那是小孩，在家里呆着反正没事。”好象吃不饱是理所当然似的。她（他）们的工作时间，至少在十三小时以上。三、劳资双方没有一定的契约。资本家有钱赚的时候就雇，赚钱少（或者不赚）的时候就退回家。工人生活无保障。如福康油坊（机关生产），因为有一万多个豆饼卖不出去，就将全部工人解雇回家了。经理姜一如说：“什么时候豆饼卖出，就什么时候叫他们回来！”四、是工人的组织和教育问题。绝大部分工人没有参加工会，有些名义上是参加了，但实际上等于没有参加。如东生油坊的工人，自去年“五一”到现在未开过一次会。有些还不知道职工会是什么东西，仍以中世纪的行会观点来看职工会。由于工人缺乏教育和工会领导，所以思想上普遍地存在着怕资本家解雇的顾虑，不敢说实话。针对上述情形：（一）沧市市委会、职工会必须迅速召开私营工厂、作坊和手工业工人代表、经理座谈会。根据劳资两利的方针和劳大决议精神，解决工资标准、工时原则、职工福利、劳动纪律等问题，督促各厂坊劳资双方订定契约，并随时检查执行情况。（二）职工会必须深入工人了解情况，组织工会加强工人教育，提高工人的阶级觉悟。              
          （超祺）
