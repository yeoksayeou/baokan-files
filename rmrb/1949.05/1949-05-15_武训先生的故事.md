The Story of Mr. Wu Xun
Huang Kejing

"The Beggar of Righteousness" is a story about the life of Wu Xun, a poor people's educator, who spent his life begging to run schools for poor children. The story takes place during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The film opens with a group of children surrounding an old beggar with white hair, asking him to "stand upside down like a dragonfly." This beggar is none other than Mr. Wu Xun. With great difficulty, he manages to prop up his stiff old bones, but unfortunately falls and gets a bloody head. The children laugh and make fun of him. This is not just the beggar and the children having fun, but a way for him to earn a few coins to run free schools for poor children. His motto is: "Let poor children learn to read and write, so they will no longer be bullied by scholars and rich people."

An elder walks over, helps Wu Xun up, and tells the children about the life of this "Beggar of Righteousness," Mr. Wu Xun. Wu Xun's life unfolds scene by scene, and we begin to see a young shepherd boy riding on the back of an ox.

It turns out that Wu Xun lost his father early and relied on his mother for survival. He lived in poverty from a young age, spending his days with cattle and sheep, eating and drinking in the mountains and fields. Whenever he saw other children reading, he was very envious. He asked his mother why he couldn't go to school, and his mother always sighed and said, "Poverty!" In his young mind, he couldn't understand why he was poor, and why being poor meant he couldn't go to school. His mother told him that poverty was his fate.

After his mother died, he lost his only support. His older brother sent him to work as a child laborer in a landlord's house. Although he was young and weak, he did the same hard work as adults, whether it was transporting grain, grinding millstones... Year after year, he grew older, and never did less work than others, but he never received a penny in return. When he spoke to the owner, he was scolded and beaten. In his pain and anger, he was fortunate to be rescued by a fellow worker who sympathized with him, who introduced him to another landlord's house. He began to hear that there would be a little pay, which was pitifully small, but it still made him very happy. Who knew that the landlord's heart was just as vicious. Not only was he abused himself, but he also saw even more terrible things: the landlord and his feudal henchmen abused maids, servants, and the daughters of poor people who were raped and committed suicide here... He began to feel that this was a place that devoured people. He didn't understand why people were so cruel, nor did he understand why poor people suffered so much, and the workers around him always said it was fate.

Working like a beast of burden, he still couldn't get any money. The landlord and his lackeys cheated and beat him because he was illiterate. He lost his job and began his wandering life.

Half a lifetime of experience had given him some awareness. He believed that rich people were oppressors, and that being illiterate meant being exploited and deceived forever. He deeply felt the pain of illiteracy. He believed that only by educating poor children could they avoid this pain and not be bullied forever. Amidst ridicule and humiliation, he resolved to beg and save money to start a free school. He sang ballads, stood upside down like a dragonfly... to ask for money, sold the white steamed buns he begged for to save up, and vowed to build this school. Wu Xun's era and environment made it impossible for him to understand why scholars and rich people had to oppress and exploit the poor. He only knew that he could teach people to escape poverty and oppression by teaching poor children to read.

However, the old society persecuted the poor in every possible way. The few coins he begged for had nowhere to be put, and were hidden under stones and in the sand, but were stolen. Lending money to people also resulted in being cheated. Finally, he found a person with a conscience to keep it for him. "Inch by inch the ant builds its house," his free school finally opened. But even teachers were unwilling to come to a school run by a beggar, and he had to kowtow to invite them. Pitiful Wu Xun, in that society, his only weapon was kowtowing. He kowtowed to plead and persuade the teachers who were absent and the students who were lazy. Many poor children eventually became "noblemen" and tools of the ruling class, while Wu Xun continued to beg, not accepting any rewards from those students, and even in his old age, he went everywhere with his little tricks to beg for money to run his free school.

This film shows the deception and exploitation of the laboring people by the landlord class in the feudal era. It also illustrates that although Mr. Wu Xun saw the irrationality of this system, he did not find a revolutionary way to change it. Therefore, we think that a person with ideas and abilities would be buried and strangled in the old society. Only in the new society can people be fully developed.

    武训先生的故事
    黄克靖
    “义丐”是写贫民教育家武训先生一生行乞办贫童学校的故事。这故事发生在清光绪年间，影片一开头便是一群孩子围着一个白发苍苍的老乞丐，要他“倒竖蜻蜓”，这个乞丐不是别人，正是武训先生。他老态龙钟的好容易支起几根僵硬的老骨头，不幸却摔了下来，弄得头破血流，孩子们笑了，朝他取乐。这不是那位乞丐和孩子们穷开心，却是为了换取几个钱，来给贫苦的孩子们办义务学校，他的宗旨是：“让穷孩子们读书识字，不再受读书人、有钱人的欺。”
    一个年长者走来，他扶起了武训，同时给孩子们讲述这位“义丐”武训先生一生的事迹，武训的大半生，从幕中一幕幕显出来，我们开始看见一个骑在牛背上的小牧童了。
    原来武训早年丧父，一直依靠着母亲度日，自幼就在穷苦中生活，白天与牛羊为伍，餐风饮露在山野草丛之中。每当途中看见别的孩子们念书时，便十分羡慕。问母亲自己为何不念书，母亲总是叹息着说：“穷”！在他幼小的心灵上始终想不开为什么要穷，穷为什么就不能念书，母亲却告诉他：穷是自己的命运。
    母亲死后，他失去了唯一的依靠，哥哥把他送到地主家里去做童工，他虽年幼力弱，却做着和成人一样的苦工，不管是运粮、推磨…。一年复一年，他年长了，任何工作也不比人少作，却终年得不到一文报酬，和东家说说，反被辱骂和毒打，他痛苦气恼之余，幸得一位同病相怜的长工救了他，介绍到另一个地主家去。他开始听说有一点工钱，虽是少得可怜，却也高兴得不得了。谁知道地主心肠一样毒，他不但自己受到虐待，而且也见到更可怕的事：地主和他的封建爪牙虐待丫头、仆人、穷人的女儿在这儿被强奸而自杀，…他开始感到这是一个吃人的地方，他不明白人们为什么会这样的狠毒，也不懂得穷人为什么这样受苦，而他周围的工人们也总是说，这是命运。
    做牛做马的为人干活，还是拿不到钱，地主和走狗欺他不识字，在欺骗毒打之下，他失业了，开始了他的流浪生活。
    半生经历使他有了些觉悟，他相信有钱人是压迫人的，不识字是永远要受苦受骗，他深深感到不识字的苦痛，他以为只有教育穷人的孩子识字，才能免除这痛苦，才不会永世的受人欺，他在讥讽和侮蔑下决心乞讨积蓄来办个义务学校。他打莲花落，竖蜻蜓……来要钱，讨得了白馒头也卖了来积畜，立志要办成这个学校。武训的时代环境，使他弄不清楚为什么读书人有钱人就要欺压、剥削穷人，他只知道教人逃避穷困和被压榨，教穷孩子们读书。
    然而旧社会迫害穷人是无孔不入的，他讨得几个钱无处放，藏在石块下，泥沙中，却被人偷了，放债给人又被欺骗了，最后总算找到一个有良心的人才给他保存了起来。“积沙成塔”，他的义务学校终于开办了。可是叫化子办的学校教书先生竟也不肯来教，他磕头作揖的才请了来。可怜苦心的武训，在那个社会，他唯一的武器是磕头，他对于先生的旷课，对于学生的懒惰，都以磕头去请、劝。不少的穷孩子终于成了“贵人”，成了统治阶级的工具，而武训却继续乞讨，并不受那些学生们的酬报，直到年老，还到处要他的小玩艺来讨钱，办他的义务学校。
    这个影片表现了封建时代地主阶级对于劳动人民的欺骗和压榨，也说明了武训先生虽然看到这个制度的不合理，但并没有找到一个革命的办法来改变这种制度。因此我们想到：一个有思想、有能力的人，在旧社会要被埋没、被绞杀，只有在新社会里，人们才能得到充分发展。
