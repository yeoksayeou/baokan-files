    Tsinghua University Completes Student Grant Evaluation, Launches Thrift Campaign

    [Our Dispatch] Tsinghua University has completed the evaluation of "People's Student Grants." Out of the school's 1,744 students, 1,265 applied. The evaluation process fostered a spirit of hard work and thrift. For example, first-year students in the Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering departments cut their own hair. The Student Union is also cooperating to launch a thrift campaign. This campaign has now gained widespread support, with many students beginning to overcome wasteful habits and starting to save.

    清华评完助学金又发起节约运动
    【本报讯】清华大学“人民助学金”评议完毕。全校学生共一千七百四十四人，申请者一千二百六十五名。经过评议，培养了艰苦节约的作风。如土木系、电机系一年级学生自己理发。学生会也配合发起节约运动。这一运动现已获得广泛响应，不少同学开始克服若干浪费习惯，实行积蓄。    （金凤）
