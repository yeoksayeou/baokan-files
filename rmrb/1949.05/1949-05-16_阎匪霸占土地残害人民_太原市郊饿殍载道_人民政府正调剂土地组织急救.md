　　Yan Bandit Seizes Land and Harms People
  　Starvation Abounds in the Suburbs of Taiyuan
    People's Government Is Adjusting Land and Organizing Emergency Relief
    [Taiyuan Electric] After endless exploitation and devastation by the Yan bandits, the rural areas of Taiyuan's suburbs have suffered unprecedented destruction. The Yan bandit troops massively seized the land of farmers. In Xiaogouzi Village, in the fifth district outside Taiyuan, out of the village’s forty-four households with 291 mu of land, the Yan bandits seized as much as 219 mu. Eleven out of sixteen farming households, with sixty-eight people, lost their land. Heavy trenches and dense groups of pillboxes made it impossible for farmers to cultivate a large part of their land. For example, in Honggou Natural Village in the fifth district, the whole village originally had 1,444 mu of land, but the Yan bandit troops dug four trenches five or six feet wide around the village and built fourteen pillboxes, occupying 450 mu of land. Now only 990 mu of land can be cultivated. In Haojiagou Village, the whole village has 1,400 mu of land, and the pillboxes and trenches built by the enemy occupy 600 mu. As a result, starvation is everywhere. In Baer Village, with thirty-eight households, eleven households are begging for food. In Dongmazhuang, with 112 households, seventy or eighty households have nothing to eat. Also, three to five families are lying on their kang, on the verge of death due to long-term hunger. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the district cadres of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts of our city quickly began the work of relieving the victims, universally established porridge kitchens, and began to distribute porridge. Then, using the method of work-for-relief, they organized a large number of victims to participate in tasks such as leveling the ground and burying corpses, and quickly transitioned to production, redistributing the land seized by the Yan bandit troops in various villages to farmers who had no land or little land. According to statistics from fifteen natural villages in the fifth district, 234 households with no land or little land, totaling 734 people, were allocated 2,500 mu of land. As of May 7th, the land redistribution work in all eleven newly liberated administrative villages in the district had been completed. Land redistribution has also begun in some villages in the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts and will be completed in two or three days. After the land redistribution, the farmers were extremely excited and said, "We have finally seen the clear sky!" In order to help the farmers in the suburbs of the city solve the problems of food, seeds, livestock, and water conservancy, so as to quickly restore production, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government and the Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China have decided to issue loans of 2.5 million RMB.

　　阎匪霸占土地残害人民
  　太原市郊饿殍载道
    人民政府正调剂土地组织急救
    【太原电】经过阎匪无止境的压榨和摧残，太原市郊农村遭到空前的破坏。阎匪军们曾大量地霸占农民的土地，太原市外五区小沟子村，全村四十四户，土地二百九十一亩，阎匪霸占的地即达二百一十九亩，十六家种地户就有十一户六十八人失掉土地，重重的战壕和密集的碉堡群，使得农民的很大一部分土地无法耕种。如五区红沟自然村，全村原有地一千四百四十四亩，阎匪军在村的四周围挖了五六尺宽的四道战壕，筑了十四个碉堡，占地四百五十亩，现只剩下九百九十亩地能耕种；郝家沟全村有地一千四百亩，敌修的碉堡战壕即占去六百亩。因此，饿殍遍地，三十八户的巴儿村，讨饭吃的就有十一户，东马庄一百一十二户，有七八十户人家已经一点吃的也没有了，还有三五家由于长期的饥饿，已躺在炕上奄奄待毙。太原解放后，我市郊五、六、七、八四个区的区干部很快的便开始了救济灾民的工作，普遍设立了粥厂，开始施粥，然后又以以工代赈的办法，组织了大批灾民参加起雷，掩埋尸体等工作，并很快的转入了生产，把阎匪军在各村霸占了的土地，调剂给了无地少地的农民，据五区十五个自然村的统计，无地少地的二三十四户，七百三十百四口人，给调剂了两千五百亩地，截至五月七日，全区新解放的十一个行政村，调剂土地工作已告结束。六、七、八区一部分村庄也开始，三两天后亦可结束。经过调剂土地后，农民们极为兴奋，都说：“这可见了青天啦！”为了帮助市郊农民解决口粮、种籽、牲畜、水利等困难问题，使之迅速恢复生产，太原市人民政府暨中国人民银行太原分行，已决定发放贷款人民券二百五十万元。
