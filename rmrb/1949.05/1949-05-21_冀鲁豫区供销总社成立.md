Jilu Yu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Established

    [Jilu Yu Telegraph] The Jilu Yu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative officially established last month. The following pilot plan and business policy have been determined: Urban supply and marketing cooperatives will focus on areas such as Hanyang and Heze. Starting with consumer cooperatives, the initial focus will be on supplying workers, government agencies, schools, and the poor with daily necessities, gradually organizing production and transportation. Rural supply and marketing cooperatives will focus on areas such as Xianzhuang Le in Qingfeng County and Guchengji in Weihe County. The focus will be on absorbing farmers' products such as straw-braided hats and vegetable oil, and supplying farmers with daily necessities, eliminating intermediate exploitation in the process. The Gongyang Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative was established on April 30th. Initially, the citizens had some concerns, but after in-depth publicity, participation became extremely enthusiastic. By May 6th, 590 people had joined the cooperative, collecting a total of 2,950 jin of rice in shares. The cooperative supplies grain and industrial products at prices lower than the market. Because the cooperative rations daily necessities, the livelihoods of its members are guaranteed, and more and more people are requesting to join. In addition to continuing to recruit members and expand its business, the cooperative is currently preparing to investigate the production situation of its members in preparation for organizing production.

　　冀鲁豫区供销总社成立
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区供销合作总社，已于上月正式成立。确定试办计划，和经营方针如下：城市供销合作社，以汉阳、菏泽等地为重点。首先从消费合作社入手供给各业工人机关学校贫民等生活必需品，逐渐组织生产运输、农村供销合作社，以清丰县仙庄乐，卫河县古城集等地为重点。以吸收农民的草帽辫植物油等产品，供应农民生活必需品。从中灭除中间剥削，为业务重点，某阳城关区供销合作社，已于四月三十日成立。最初市民还有顾虑，经深入宣传，入社者极为踊跃。到五月六日已有五百九十人入社，共收股金米二千九百五十斤。合作社以低于市场的价格供给粮食及工业品，由于生活必需品合作社均有定量配售，社员生活得到保障，请求入社的日多。该社除继续吸收社员，扩展业务外，目前正准备调查社员生产情况，准备组织生产。
