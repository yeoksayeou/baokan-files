Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 3rd: Frontline reporters reported on the situation of the enemy's collapse and surrender in the great annihilation battle in the area north of Guangde, Langxi, and Changxing: The vanguard troops of the Kuomintang bandit army that had retreated from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuhu had just arrived in the suburbs of Guangde when they were intercepted by the People's Liberation Army, which had rushed from hundreds of miles away, and immediately fell into the tight encirclement rapidly formed by the various PLA units. The center of this large encirclement was in the mountainous area 25 *hua li* north of Guangde. The area was characterized by overlapping mountains, dense forests, and only small mountain paths for passage. After the bandit army fell into this desperate situation, it collapsed and fled in all directions. The PLA intercepted them slightly and they surrendered, laying down their arms. Three cavalrymen of a certain PLA unit encountered more than 400 enemy troops, fired a volley of shots, and the entire enemy unit immediately surrendered. Not long after the battle began on the 28th, tens of thousands of enemies were captured. On the 29th, the PLA units braved the cold wind and rain, climbed over mountains and ridges, and passed through the jungle, launching courageous attacks from all directions against the surrounded enemy. At about 5 p.m., the attacking troops from all directions victoriously converged in the center of the encirclement. PLA soldiers were densely deployed in the valleys and jungles, capturing scattered fleeing bandits and collecting weapons, ammunition, and materials abandoned by the bandit army. Ragged and exhausted bandit soldiers waited on the hillsides for the PLA to take them in. As soon as a PLA soldier led a few prisoners over, they would follow, instantly forming a long line. The prisoner队伍 were mixed up with different unit designations. In one prisoner队伍 of less than 200 people, as many as eleven different units were found.

    广德以北地区大歼灭战中
    敌军狼狈溃灭缴枪投降
    我骑兵三人一次俘匪四百余名
    【新华社长江前线三日电】前线记者报道：在广德、郎溪、长兴以北地区大歼灭战中，敌人狼狈溃灭的情形说：自南京、镇江和芜湖等地溃退下来的国民党匪军的先头部队刚到广德城郊，就被数百里外赶来的解放大军拦头截住，立即陷入各路解放军迅速形成的严密包围圈中。这个大包围圈的中心在广德城北二十五华里的山区。该地山岭重叠，林木丛密，仅有山谷中小路可以通行。匪军陷入这个绝境后，就溃不成军，各自满山遍野地逃命。解放军略加截击，就缴枪投降。解放军某部三个骑兵与匪军四百余人遭遇，打了一排子枪，该部敌人立即全部投降。二十八日战斗开始不久，俘敌数万人。二十九日，解放军各路大军冒着寒风冷雨，翻山越岭，穿过丛林，从四面八方向被围之敌奋勇攻击，至下午五时许，各路攻击部队就在包围圈的中心胜利会合。解放军战士们都密布在山谷及丛林中，捕捉零星溃匪及收集匪军丢弃的武器弹药物资。褴褛不堪的匪军散兵，都在山坡上冒雨等候解放军收容，只要一个解放军战士领着几个俘虏过来，他们便纷纷跟上，刹时便成为一长列。俘虏队中番号错杂，在有一个不满二百人的俘虏队中，发现的番号竟达十一个单位之多。
