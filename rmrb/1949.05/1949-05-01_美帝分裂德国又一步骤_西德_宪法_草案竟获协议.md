Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: Reports from various sources: On April 25th, the delegation of the so-called Bonn "Parliamentary Committee" of West Germany (including representatives of the Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party), and the military governors of the three Western occupation zones of West Germany, held a meeting in Frankfurt, the capital of the American occupation zone. Mr. Heffé, the Director of the German-Austrian Office of the US State Department, also attended. After five hours of repeated negotiations, the meeting reached an agreement on the draft of the so-called "Constitution" of the West German separatist state. This draft had been the subject of lengthy and unceasing disputes between the West German Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party, as well as between them and the Western governors. Well-informed sources in Frankfurt revealed that the rapid passage of the decision by the meeting was due to the Western governors' insistence on reaching an agreement immediately. The Social Democratic Party's abandonment of "the last point of resistance" once again proves that it has neither the power nor the will to resist the Western occupying authorities.

    美帝分裂德国又一步骤
    西德“宪法”草案竟获协议
    【新华社北平二十九日电】各方报道：四月二十五日，西德所谓波恩“议会委员会”的代表团（包括社会民主党和基督教民主党的代表），与西德三占领区的军事总督，在美占区的首府法兰克福举行会议，美国国务院德奥司司长黑菲亦出席。在经过五小时反复谈判之后，会议就西德分立国家的所谓“宪法”草案获得协议，这一草案曾经是西德社会民主党与基督教民主党之间以及它们与西方总督之间长时期争吵不休的题目。法兰克福消息灵通方面透露：会议之迅速通过决定，系由于西方总督坚持立刻获致协议。社会民主党之放弃“最后一点的抵抗”，再次证明它既没有力量也没有意志反抗西方占领当局。
