    Farmers Enter the City and Have a Home
    Scattered Notes on the Shijiazhuang Farmers' Service Center
    Xia Jingfan
    The eastern end of Daxing Street, as quiet as the countryside, has gradually become lively with the development of the Farmers' Service Center there. Cigarette stalls have sprung up one after another in front of the Farmers' Service Center, and vendors selling fruit, sesame cakes, braised meat, and popsicles constantly appear in the courtyard of the service center, especially lively at night.

    From the courtyard to the street, it is often full of large and small carts loading coal and purchasing bran, grain chaff, and dried radish. They line up according to their numbers and purchase in order. The farmers are mostly familiar with the procedures for buying things here, and they are used to it. At first, the comrades of the service center asked them to maintain order, but now they automatically maintain order and supervise each other; occasionally, if someone does not follow the rules, they will be immediately interfered with by everyone.

    Some farmers have come to the service center once or twice, and some have come more than ten times. At first, they simply praised the service center for being good, but gradually they developed an inseparable relationship with the service center. They realized from practice that the service center is not just doing business, but a "home" that plans everything for them.

    Therefore, it is no longer possible to see any restraint from the farmers here. Getting up in the morning, they compete to sweep the floor, and when they see that the kitchen is too busy, they compete to fan the fire. When the working comrades ask them to rest, they always say, "It's not tiring, it doesn't matter to do this little thing! You go and do something else." Sometimes the working comrades feel bad and compete with them to do it, so the villagers say in a semi-blaming tone: "I come here often, shouldn't I do this little thing? You don't need to be so polite, we are all one of us." "You are not doing business, but serving us. You don't want to make money, and we should help a little."

    Regular villagers even know where the electrical switches in each room are. When it is time to turn on the lights in the evening, they turn them on themselves, and they turn off the lights themselves when they go to bed. Familiar villagers take care of the newcomers, and many people have figured out the surnames of each working comrade and their division of labor. When newcomers need to do something, the regulars act as guides: "You should go to Lao Hou for this." "You should go to Lao Wu for this." Sometimes when the things they want to sell are out of stock, they kindly say to the working comrades: "Lao Hou, can you make a phone call and ask if there is any elsewhere?"

    In terms of operation, they are particularly concerned about the service center. For example, regarding the food issue, at first the service center charged one jin of rice or one jin of flour per person per meal, and some villagers who had traveled a long distance or run a day's business were already hungry. As a result, some people ate more than two jin of rice in one meal, and generally more than one jin of rice, and they only collected money after eating. Therefore, the regular villagers worriedly said, "The working comrades here are all good, but some are laymen. Charging one jin of rice for 'all you can eat', how much money do you want to lose? If this method lasts, it will bankrupt this place!" They also said, "There is no need to collect the meal money after eating, if there are too many people, it is inevitable that some people will be careless (meaning not paying)." They were really afraid of poor management, which would lead to the inability to maintain and collapse. They often expressed their concern for the service center: "It is enough to help us by doing some things in the city here. It is enough if the food is a little cheaper and more convenient than outside. Everything should be planned for the long term." The implication was that the service center was not good at "managing the household."

    When the villagers saw that the vendors in front of the service center were doing good business, they said to the comrades of the service center with envy: "Why don't we (referring to the service center) sell some cigarettes, alkali noodles, needles, thread, matches, and kerosene here? Look how good other people's business is. They can earn a lot of our money." They continued to explain this opinion, saying: "If we come to buy a few packs of matches or a pound of kerosene, and we ask the comrades to run an errand every time, that would be too hard!"

    From these opinions, it can be seen how sincerely the farmers are concerned about the future of this undertaking. The Farmers' Service Center does need to continuously improve its work and business and listen to the opinions of the farmers in order to truly meet the requirements of the farmers. The method of "all you can eat" for food did lose a lot of money in the two months it was implemented. The opinions of the farmers were accepted. The method of charging by the jin (rice soup is free) and adopting the method of buying meal tickets before serving food was implemented, so that there was no problem in maintaining the cost of food. The service center is now planning to open a retail department for sporadic items.

    Every evening, while everyone is eating, the working comrades tell everyone about the business situation of the day, the work to be done the next day, and the things to be received and sold. Everyone should know about the difficult and the easy things. The conversation also includes self-criticism and soliciting everyone's opinions, like casual family talk, and finally talking about the current situation and the important news in the day's newspaper. Under these circumstances, the farmers' feelings for the service center are getting deeper and deeper. The villagers care about the health of the working comrades and often say: "You are too busy, you should rest for a while." At the same time, they often encourage the comrades and say: "You must do a good job, when the grain comes down, there will be more things to bother you with than now!"

    Everyone is familiar with each other, and they are closer in work and emotion. The villagers actively help to offer suggestions, so that the four reception comrades and two cooks of the first branch can now take care of nearly 300 people's business and meals every day, and still do it, and it is even smoother than the scene of a dozen people taking care of dozens of people at the beginning.

    农民进城有了家
    石家庄农民服务所散记
    夏景凡
    象乡村一样僻静的大兴街东头，随着农民服务所在那里的发展，渐渐地也热闹起来。纸烟摊一个个地在农民服务所门前摆开了，叫卖果子、烧饼、酱肉、冰棍的不断出现在服务所的院子里，晚上尤其热闹。
    从院里到街上，常常停满着装运煤炭和购买麸子、谷糠、萝卜干的大车、小车，他们按号头排起队，依次购买。农民对这里买东西的手续大部熟悉了，也习惯了。起初服务所的同志要求他们守秩序，现在他们自动维持秩序，并且互相监督；偶而有一个人不守秩序，马上就会受到大家的干涉。
    来到服务所的农民一次、两次，有的已经上十次了。他们起初是一味的称赞服务所好，慢慢地他们和服务所有了不可分离的感情，他们从实际中体会服务所不是一般做买卖的，而是一切都为他们打算的一个“家”了。
    因此，在这里已经看不出农民还有什么拘束。早上起来，他们争着扫地，看厨房里忙不过来时就争着去扇火，工作同志要他们休息，他们总说：“不累，做这点小事没关系！你们去忙别的罢。”有时工作同志过意不去，就和他们争着做，于是老乡便以半责备的口吻说：“我常来，连这点小事就不该做？你们不要太讲礼了，都是自己人。”“你们又不是作买卖的，为你们服务。不图赚钱，我们搭个手帮下忙也是应该的。”
    常来的老乡，连每个屋的电门都知道在哪里，入晚该开灯的时候，他们自己开，睡下了自己就把灯关上。熟悉的照顾着新来的，许多人都弄清了每个工作同志的姓，以及他们的分工，新来的人要办什么事，常来的人便是向导：“这事你去找老侯。”“这事你去找老武。”有时他们要卖的东西没有了，他们就亲切地向工作同志说：“老侯，你去打个电话问问别处还有没有？”
    在经营上，他们对服务所尤其关心。如对伙食问题，起初该所按照每人每顿收一斤米或一斤面钱管饱，有些老乡因为赶了一程路途或跑了一天买卖，早就饿了，结果有人一顿竟吃到二斤米以上，一般也都超过一斤米，并且是吃完后才收钱。因此，常来的老乡担心的说？“这里工作同志什么都好，就是有些外行，收一斤米的钱吃饭‘管饱’，你想要赔多少钱哪？这办法长了要把这里吃垮哩！”又说：“饭钱用不着吃完才收，人多了就难免有人吃马虎（不付钱的意思）。”他们真怕经营不善，弄到不能维持垮了台，他们时常表露对服务所的关心：“这里跟咱办些城里的事就够帮助咱们了，吃饭比外面便宜点方便点就行，一切要往长处打算。”言下很有责备服务所不大会“过日子”的意思。
    老乡看到服务所门前的小贩生意不坏，他很眼红地向服务所的同志说：“我们这里（指服务所）为什么不卖点纸烟、碱面、针线、火柴、煤油？你看别人的生意多好。他们可赚咱不少钱。”他们继续解释这个意见说：“我们来买几包火柴，打一斤煤油，要是都叫同志们出去跑一趟，那也太辛苦了！”
    从这些意见可以看出农民是怎样实心实意地关心着这一事业的前途。农民服务所的确需要在工作与业务上不断改进和听取农民的意见才能真正达到满足农民的要求。在伙食上“管饱”的办法，实行两个月确实赔了不少钱，接受农民的意见。实行按斤两收费（米汤不要钱），并采用先购饭票后端饭的办法，这样一来，伙食上维持成本就无问题了。对开设零星物品零售部，该所现正筹划中。
    每当晚上，趁大家吃饭的时候，工作同志便把一天来的业务情形，第二天要做的工作，以及准备收进和卖出的东西，都讲给大家听，有困难的和没有困难的事都要大家知道。谈话里也带着检讨和征求大家意见，象拉家常一样，最后谈到时局和当天报纸上的重要消息。在这种情形下，农民对服务所感情越来越深。老乡们关心工作同志的健康，常说：“你们太忙了，该休息一下。”同时也常鼓励同志们说：“你们要好好办，到了粮食下来，来麻烦你们的事可比现在多啊！”
    大家都熟了，在工作上和感情上更加密切。老乡们主动的帮忙提意见，使第一分所的四个招待同志和两个炊事员同志，现在每天照顾到将近三百人的买卖和吃饭，依然做得下去，而且比起初十几个人照顾几十个人的场面还要顺利些。（附图片）
