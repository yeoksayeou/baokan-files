　　Chinese Scientific Workers Association Cables Protest Against Persecution of Joliot-Curie
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Chinese Scientific Workers Association issued a telegram yesterday (16th), protesting the persecution of Dr. Joliot-Curie by reactionary French newspapers. The telegram stated: "The Chinese Scientific Workers Association expresses its deep indignation at the persecution suffered by French scientist Dr. Frédéric Joliot-Curie by reactionary French newspapers for serving as Chairman of the Presidium of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and for the upright words he uttered in his position as chairman! Everyone knows that Dr. Joliot-Curie is one of the most outstanding atomic scientists in the world today. He has always been at the forefront of the struggle to defend world peace and promote human happiness. He is not only the Chairman of the Presidium of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, but has also continued to serve as the Director-General of the 'World Federation of Scientific Workers' since its establishment. As *l'Humanité* rightly says, the threat to Joliot-Curie is a threat to the whole of French science. But we want to point out that the threat to Mr. Joliot-Curie is also a threat to science and culture throughout the world. Chinese scientific workers must stand together with scientific workers all over the world to give Mr. Joliot-Curie effective support."

　　中国科学工作者协会通电
  　抗议迫害居里
    【本报讯】中国科学工作者协会于昨日（十六日）发表通电，抗议法国反动报纸迫害居里博士，通电称：“中国科学工作者协会对于法国若利奥·居里博士因担任此次世界拥护和平大会常设委员会主席团主席，和他在主席地位所发表的正直言论，而遭受法国反动报纸的迫害一事表示深深的愤慨！大家知道，若利奥·居里博士是现今世界上最杰出的原子科学家之一，对于保卫世界和平和促进人类幸福的奋斗，他一向是站在最前线的。他不仅是此次世界拥护和平大会常设委员会主席团的主席，并且自‘世界科学工作者协会’成立以来继续担任着理事长。人道报说得好，对居里的威胁是对整个法兰西科学的威胁。但我们要指出，对居里先生的威胁同时也是对全世界科学和文化的威胁。中国的科学工作者们必须和全世界的科学工作者们站在一起予居里先生以有效的声援。”
