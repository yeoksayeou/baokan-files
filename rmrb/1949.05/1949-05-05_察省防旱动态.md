    Chahar Province Drought Resistance Dynamics
    Liangxiang: Land-Reformed Peasant Liu Rong Volunteers to Dig a Well
    [Chahar News] Land-reformed peasants in Liangxiang are actively digging wells to carry water for planting cotton.
    County and district cadres are specifically helping village production committees to study where wells are needed and whose land can use water, and are mobilizing the masses to dig wells to fight the drought. For example, they went to the rice shops to find well-digging technicians. Each person wanted two dou and five sheng of corn per day, and six people working wanted the wages of seven people. The wage was too expensive to proceed. Liu Rong, a poor peasant who had just been allocated land, said, "I'll go down the well, and you can pay me what you think is right. For more than ten years, I wanted to farm but couldn't. Now that the Communist Party has come, I have been allocated thirteen mu of land. This is beneficial to everyone. I am willing to do it even if you don't pay me." Comrade Wang Binghua from the promotion cooperative encouraged him and temporarily borrowed 2,000 jin of lime from the cooperative, which boosted everyone's enthusiasm for digging wells. Five wells, each eight to nine zhang deep, have now been completed, saving eighty-four workdays, equivalent to twenty-one shi of corn. During the well-digging process, the masses cared for Liu Rong. The well was too deep and cold, and there was water, so everyone bought wine and sent it down for him to drink.
    Village cadres in Doudian Village, such as Du Hai, personally led a group to be responsible for a well. The whole village has now dug twenty-four wells, and the whole district has now dug thirty-nine wells. Fifteen old wells have been repaired, and nine are being dug. Cotton is beginning to be planted in the places where wells have been dug. Sixty mu have been planted in Second Street in Doudian, and each village is soaking seeds and preparing to plant peanuts. The area planted with cotton in the whole district has exceeded the plan by 220 mu.

    Early Preparations for Drought Resistance Work
    More Than Two Hundred Waterwheels Added
    [Chahar News] In order to strengthen drought resistance and expand the area of irrigated land, the county leadership called on farmers to dig wells and repair waterwheels in large numbers in early spring. In the past two months, farmers throughout the county have actively responded to the call and have overfulfilled their tasks. In Pingtong and Gaoqian villages in the Seventh District alone, farmers sold their allocated ill-gotten gains and purchased forty complete sets of new waterwheels. According to the demands of the masses, the chairman of the Gaoqian Farmers' Association and the village chief set up two stoves, using eight blacksmiths and thirty carpenters to rush to make new waterwheel buckets and repair sixteen broken waterwheels. They also prepared 5,000 jin of iron to exchange for new waterwheels in Shijiazhuang. The county production promotion cooperative also set up two professional cadres to actively contact the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative in Shijiazhuang to sell waterwheels on their behalf. The district offices went deep into the villages to publicize and organize the masses to purchase them. After Liu Peiqin from Loudi Village in the Sixth District purchased a waterwheel, farmers from surrounding villages ten li away came to the well to see it. Liu Ruixiang from the village said, "This pipe waterwheel is really good. The water comes up so fast and it's easy to pull. I'll buy one too." Liu Peiqin said, "It's not just good, it's also cheap! Only 800 jin of rice, and you don't have to pay it all at once. The rice is also discounted (at that time, the market price of millet was 18 yuan (RMB) per jin, but it was calculated at 12 yuan)." Liu Qiu Bao from Xiyang City said when purchasing, "The government really cares about us and knows that we have land, so they prepare cheap waterwheels for us." Wang Hanlin said excitedly, "Let's buy one! We won't have to worry about drought anymore!" The masses in the Sixth and Seventh Districts went to the district offices to borrow money to purchase waterwheels. In Fangcun Village in the Sixth District alone, twenty-three waterwheels were purchased. Some said, "How can we not produce more grain when the government helps us like this!" According to incomplete statistics, 112 waterwheels have been purchased in the fifteen villages in the Sixth and Seventh Districts. The waterwheel factories run by the farmers themselves have expanded to three. In the 229 villages in the county, according to incomplete statistics from only 78 villages, 237 new waterwheels have been purchased, exceeding the 200 waterwheels assigned by the special commissioner. In addition, 264 broken waterwheels have been repaired. The masses have also dug and restored a large number of wells. Sixty-four new wells have been dug and 167 wells have been repaired. One hundred and thirty-seven well ropes and one hundred and thirty-seven willow cans have been purchased, playing a huge role in drought resistance and sowing.

    Wanxian
    Ten-Day Crash Planting of Cotton
    [Chahar News] The Wanxian Production Committee held a temporary meeting on April 22 to review and decide on the current production situation: Starting from the 28th of this month, a ten-day crash planting of cotton will be launched. All cadres in the county, except for the industry and commerce tax departments who will be engaged in tax collection work, will organize and lead the masses to plant cotton, and will determine key planting areas. In terms of water conservancy, all waterwheels must be fully utilized, broken waterwheels must be repaired, and the masses must continue to be organized to purchase waterwheels and build brick wells. Districts that can dig earthen wells should try their best to dig them. All river water and puddles that can be used should be used to maximize the use of water. Specific requirements should be made according to the existing conditions in each district. The county committees must personally take action and be responsible for different areas. More than 50 cadres in the county have now gone to the countryside.

    Jingxing
    Improving Mass Awareness to Complete the Democratic Canal
    [Chahar News] The Democratic Canal in Jingxing was opened in 1947. At that time, it was simply run by the government, with little use of the strength of the masses. Therefore, although 85,000 jin of rice and 30,000 yuan of Jicha were used, it cultivated the masses' reliance on the government, thinking that digging the canal was only to earn the government's millet. For example, the leader of the workers' group, Wang Jun, said, "Everyone, work faster!" and the response he received was, "This is not your family's business, why are you so anxious?"
    In February of this year, the leadership made the greatest determination to rectify the canal. First, let the masses discuss: "Who is the canal for?" After repeated persuasion and mobilization, they realized that "digging the canal is for the masses to irrigate their own land." Then let everyone discuss "Should we do it? How should we do it?" The masses unanimously believed that they could not give up halfway. They also discussed: "Is it okay to rely solely on the government?" After more than three days of mobilization and discussion, the masses' thinking changed. They all believed that if we had worked hard from the beginning, plus the government's help, the project would have been completed long ago. The enthusiasm of the masses increased. They made their own plan: the grain used should be temporarily borrowed from wealthy households, and the work should be evaluated and settled after the wheat harvest. Starting on March 23, all channels must be completed within forty-five days. Now the project is about to be completed, and the task of irrigating an additional 1,400 mu of land will soon be completed. Therefore, the masses are very enthusiastic. Chen Jianghe, a 69-year-old man, said, "Let's work hard! Dry land will soon become irrigated land!"

    察省防旱动态
    良乡  翻身农民刘荣自报奋勇打井
    【察哈尔讯】良乡翻身农民正积极打井，担水点种棉花。
    县区干部具体帮助村生产委员会，研究什么地方缺井？谁的地能用上水？发动群众打井抗旱。如抄米店找打井的技术人，每天每人要玉米二斗五升，六人作活要七个人的工钱，工价贵不能打，刚分了地的贫农刘荣说：“我下井你们看着给，十几年想种地就没种上，共产党来了，我分了十三亩地，这是大伙有利的事。不给我工钱我也愿意。”推进社王炳华同志就鼓励了他，并暂由推进社借给大灰两千斤，这样鼓起大家的打井情绪，现已完成五眼井，都是八至九丈深，省工八十四个，合玉米二十一石，打井中群众爱护刘荣，井深太冷又有水，大家就买酒给他送下去喝。
    窦店村干部杜海等，都亲自带一组包一个井，全村现已打出井二十四眼，全区现已挖井三十九眼。修旧井十五眼，正挖中九眼。挖好井的地方正开始种棉花。窦店二街已种上六十亩，各村正浸种，并准备点种花生，全区种棉已超过计划二百二十亩。

    防旱工作准备早
    水车增加二百多
    【察哈尔讯】为加强防旱扩大水地面积，县领导上于春初即号召农民大量凿井，增修水车。两月来全县农民积极响应号召，已超数完成任务。仅七区平同、高迁两村，农民变卖分得浮财，购买全套新水车四十架。高迁农会主席、村长根据群众要求，设炉两盘，用铁匠八名，木匠三十名，除大量赶制新水车斗子外，并修好了破水车十六架，另外准备了五千斤铁，到石家庄换新水车。县生产推进社并设专业干部二人，主动和石家庄华北水利推进社连系，替他们代销水车，各区办事处到村深入宣传组织群众购买。六区楼底村刘佩钦购回水车后，周围村庄农民十来里地都跑到井上看，该村刘瑞祥说：“这管子水车倒是不错，水上来的多猛，拉着又轻，我也买一架”。刘佩钦说：“不光好，价还便宜哩！才八百斤米，又不一下交清，米折价又低（当时小米行市每斤十八元（人民币）这按十二元）。”西洋市刘秋保购买时说：“政府结记咱真到，知道咱有了地，就给咱预备便宜水车哩”。王汉林兴奋的说：“买一架吧！旱了就不发愁了！”六七区群众纷纷到区办事处贷购，仅六区方村一个村，即贷购二十三架。有的说：“政府这样帮助咱，怎能不多打粮食哩！”现据不完全统计，六七区的十五个村，已贷购一百一十二架。现在由农民自办的水车工厂，已扩大到三处。全县二百二十九个村庄，仅七十八个村的不完全统计，已增购新水车二百三十七架，超数完成专署布置的二百架的任务，另又修补破水车二百六十四架。群众又大量凿井与恢复坏井，现已打新井六十四眼，修理井一百六十七眼。购井绳一百三十七条，柳罐一百三十七个。在防旱播种中起极大作用。

    完县
    突击十日点种棉花
    【察哈尔讯】完县生产委员会在四月廿二日召开了临时会议，对当前的生产情况做了检查和决定：从本月二十八日起，开展浇种点种棉花突击旬。县全体干部除工商税收部门进行税收工作外，其他各个部门都要组织领导群众点种棉花，并确定点种重点区。在水利上，要把所有的水车完全使用起来，坏水车修理好，并继续组织群众购买水车打砖井，能挖土井的区要尽量挖，凡一切河流水汪能用的即用，以达水尽其利，并按各区现有条件，做出具体要求。各县委要亲自下手，分头负责，现全县五十余干部已分头下乡。

    井陉
    提高群众认识完成民主大渠
    【察哈尔讯】井陉一九四七年开办了民主渠，当时只是单纯的公家开办，很少发挥群众的力量，因此虽用了八万五千斤米，三万元冀钞，结果却养成群众依靠公家的思想，认为挑渠只是为挣公家的小米。如工人小组长王俊说了一句“大伙快点干”，他得到的回答是“这又不是过你家的光景哩，闹那么紧急干啥”。
    今年二月间，领导上下了最大的决心，整顿该渠，首先让群众讨论：“开渠是为谁？”经反复说服动员，才认识“开渠是为群众自己浇地。”继则让大家讨论“干不干？如何干？”群众一致认为不能半途而废。又讨论：“光依靠公家行不行？”经过三天多的动员与讨论，群众的思想扭转了，都认为若开始咱们就努力干，再加上公家的帮助，工程早已完成。群众的情绪提高了，他们订出了自己的计划，用的粮食先用花户暂借，麦收后评工清理。自三月二十三日开始，要在四十五天内完成全部渠道。现在工程将竣，增浇一千四百亩土地的任务，即将完成。因此群众情绪很高，六十九岁的老汉陈江河说：“吃劲干吧！旱地眼看就变成水地了”！
