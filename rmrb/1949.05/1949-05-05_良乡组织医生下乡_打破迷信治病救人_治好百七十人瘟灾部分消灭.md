    Liangxiang Organizes Doctors to Go to the Countryside
    Breaking Superstition to Treat Diseases and Save People
    Curing 170 People, Plague Partially Eliminated
    [Chahar News] An epidemic occurred in eleven villages including Chenjiatai in the fifth district of Liangxiang. A total of 269 people were sick in the eleven villages, and 21 died. Most of the symptoms were scarlet fever (measles), smallpox, chronic typhoid fever, and sores on the upper lip, which doctors called "bridle sores," and some had symptoms such as not speaking. Five villages were the most serious. For example, in Chenjiatai, 51 people were sick and 8 died; Erdaogou was a small mountain village with 30 households, and 28 people were sick; in Shibanfang, 40 people were sick and 3 died; in Bangge Village, 42 people were sick and 3 died.

    After the epidemic was discovered in various villages, the masses were superstitious, prayed to gods and Buddhas, some invited sorceresses and shamans to drink incense ash, some went to temples to burn incense, some hung a strand of hemp on the door, and some tied a red cloth strip on the door, rarely asking doctors for treatment.

    After the district discovered this, it immediately convened a symposium of all the doctors in the district (eleven people attended) to study ways to eliminate the plague. The county party committee also issued an emergency instruction on epidemic prevention and organized forces to identify four key villages. Doctors were divided into four groups to treat patients in each village, expose superstitious activities, and educate the masses.

    When doctors went to treat patients in various households, some people refused treatment, and some patients' doors were tied with red cloth and hemp, not allowing strangers to enter. The doctors were rebuffed and returned very unhappy. The work team cadres explained and studied how to proceed. First, they conducted widespread publicity in various villages, using blackboards and rooftop broadcasts, and then went to various households to understand the epidemic situation. In Chenjiatai Village, there was a Li Ying, a family of five. A young boy had measles, and soon three children were infected. His family invited a sorceress to perform rituals, and as a result, two young boys died, leaving only one girl still sick. There were more than ten such households.

    After understanding the situation, various meetings were held, such as branch meetings, village cadre meetings, mass meetings, and symposiums for the parents of patients. At the meetings, the severity of the epidemic was explained first, and then the epidemic prevention methods were discussed, pointing out: The ward should not be too dry, the floor should be sprinkled with water frequently, patients and healthy people should be separated, and no visits were allowed. Later, the result of Li Ying's children being treated by a sorceress, which resulted in the death of two children, was used to educate the masses. Such meetings played a considerable role. An old woman in her sixties said, "What you said is too right. If we had these methods earlier, Li Ying's two children would not have died. It was the sorceress who delayed them." Now most of the masses' superstitious thoughts have been dispelled, and doctors have begun to treat patients in various households and carry out publicity to prevent infection. In half a month, 170 patients have been rescued in the eleven villages, and treatment is continuing.

### 良乡组织医生下乡  打破迷信治病救人  治好百七十人瘟灾部分消灭

    良乡组织医生下乡
    打破迷信治病救人
    治好百七十人瘟灾部分消灭
    【察哈尔讯】良乡五区陈家台等十一村，发生瘟疫。十一个村共病二百六十九人，死去二十一人。病症大部是大红袍（麻疹）、出天花、慢性伤寒，还有上嘴唇出疔毒，医生叫“箍嘴疔”，又有得病不说话等症。有五个村最严重，如陈家台病者五十一人，死去八人；二道沟是三十户的小山庄，得病的即二十八人；石板坊病者四十人，死去三人；班各村病者四十二人，死去三人。
    各村流行病发现后，群众迷信，求神拜佛，有的请神婆、跳神喝香灰，有的到庙里去烧香，有的在门头上挂一缕麻，有的门口上拴一红布条，很少请医生治疗。
    区里发觉后，马上即召集全区医生开座谈会（到会人数十一人），研究扑灭瘟疫办法，县委又发出关于防疫紧急指示，并组织力量，确定了四个重点村，医生分四个小组到各村治疗，并揭穿迷信活动，教育群众。
    医生到各户看病，有些群众不治，有些病房门口拴红布和麻的，不让生人进门。医生碰了钉子，回来很不高兴，工作组干部又进行解释，研究进行办法。首先到各村普遍进行宣传，利用黑板报，屋顶广播等，其次即到各户了解瘟疫流行状况，在陈家台村有一李英，全家五口人，一小男孩出麻疹，不久三个小孩都传染上了，他家请神婆跳神，结果两个小男孩都死了，只剩下一女孩正在病着。类似这样的有十余户。
    了解情况后即开各种会议，如支部会、村干会、群众大会，和病人家长座谈会等，在会上首先讲明瘟疫流行的严重性，又谈防疫法，指出：病房不要太干燥，经常用水洒地，病人和好人隔离开，不准串门等。后又将李英小孩有病请神婆两个小孩都死了的结果教育群众。这样会议起到相当作用，有一六十多岁老大婆说：“这话说的太对啦，早要有这些法子，李英那两个小孩不能都死了，就是叫神婆子跳神给耽误了。”现群众迷信思想大部解除，医生开始到各户治疗，并进行宣传防止传染，在半个月当中，十一村内救活病人一百七十人，现正继续救治中。
