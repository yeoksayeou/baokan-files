Constant Progress
Ye Shengtao

The "May Fourth" Movement is a landmark in the history of modern Chinese youth movements. What this movement advocated for, in its positive aspects, were science and democracy, and in its negative aspects, anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. If it were only the ideals of a few, it could not have launched such a movement. It was necessarily due to the objective situation having its necessity that, once called upon, it unfolded into a widespread movement. The so-called necessity is, simply put, that the Chinese people must live well, both materially and spiritually, and that being well has no limit; today must be better than yesterday, and next year must be better than this year. This necessity brought another necessity, which is that China must become an independent, autonomous, prosperous, and happy country. Achieving these two necessities is the goal, and science, democracy, anti-imperialism, and anti-feudalism are the pathways or plans. The social movements following the "May Fourth" Movement, as well as the various expressions of academic research and literary and artistic creation, although not entirely consistent, generally speaking, have been proceeding along a mainstream, which is to follow the above-mentioned pathways or plans to achieve the above-mentioned goals. Anyone who does not follow this mainstream or even obstructs this mainstream is said to be reactionary or counter-revolutionary. Reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements are the enemies of the people and the country, because they do not allow the people to live well and do not want the country to be independent, autonomous, prosperous, and happy.

If you ask who is the main force in this mainstream, it must be the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party takes scientific philosophy as the basis of its thought, seeks truth from facts, is native-born and bred, formulates various programs and policies, and acts immediately upon knowing, seeking knowledge in action, mixing theory and practice into a seamless whole. To this day, you see, the vast area north of the Yangtze River has been completely liberated, and the area south of the Yangtze River is gradually being liberated. The people have turned themselves over and established a democratic regime. Production and construction have become the central issues of the people's enthusiasm, making full use of science and expecting to obtain the greatest results. Within the vast liberated areas, the forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have been swept away. Therefore, the science, democracy, anti-imperialism, and anti-feudalism that the "May Fourth" Movement advocated for have been thoroughly transformed into flesh-and-blood reality through the leadership and efforts of the Chinese Communist Party and through the support and struggle of the broad masses of the people: this is the most accurate and fair statement.

Thirty years, in terms of history, is truly a short period, but there has been so much progress: how can we not be extremely excited? Thinking about the future, the liberation of the whole of China will be realized in the near future, and with the hard work and enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, production and construction will be completed step by step ahead of schedule, and the people's lives will get better and better without limit, and the New Democratic New China will stand firmly in East Asia: that progress will be even greater than today. Progress, constant progress, is what we should take to encourage ourselves and be proud of.

    不断的进步
    叶圣陶
    “五四”是我国现代史上青年运动开始的标帜。这个运动所号召的，积极方面是科学跟民主，消极方面是反帝反封建。如果只是少数人的理想，决不能够发动这么一个运动。必然由于客观情势上有它的必需，才会一经号召，就展开成为广泛的运动。所谓必需，说起来也很简单。就是中国人民必需生活得好，物质上精神上都好，而且好没有止境，今天要比昨天好，明年要比今年好。这个必需带来了另外一个必需，就是中国必需成为独立自主繁荣康乐的国家。实现这两个必需是目标，科学、民主、反帝、反封建是途径或方案。“五四”以后历次的社会运动，以及学术研究、文艺创作种种方面的表现，虽然不见得完全一致，可是大体说来，都顺着一道主流在那里进行，就是遵从上面所说的途径或方案来达到上面所说的目标。谁不顺着这一道主流甚至阻挡住这一道主流，大家就说他反动或者反革命。反动反革命分子是人民跟国家的敌人，因为他不让人民生活得好，不要国家独立自主繁荣康乐。
    若问谁是这一道主流中的主力，那必得推中国共产党。中国共产党把科学的哲学作为思想的根据，实事求是，土生土长，制定了种种的纲领跟政策，而且即知即行，行中求知，把理论跟实践搅和成浑然的整体。到今天为止，你看，大江以北的广大地区全解放了，大江以南正在逐渐解放。人民翻了身，建立了民主政权。生产跟建设成为人民热狂的中心问题，尽量的利用科学，期望得到最大的成果。在解放了的广大地区以内，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的势力已经一扫而空。所以，“五四”当时所号召的科学、民主、反帝、反封建，经中国共产党的领导跟努力，经广大人民的拥护跟奋斗，才彻底化为有血有肉的现实：这样说法是最为确切公平的。
    三十年的时间，在历史上说起来，真是短短的一段儿，可是进步就有这么多：我们怎得不非常之兴奋？再想想未来，全中国的解放在最近期间就将实现，在全国人民的勤劳跟热忱之下，生产跟建设必将先于预期而逐步完成，人民的生活没有止境的好起来，新民民主义的新中国强固的站定在东亚：那进步比今天更多了。进步，不断的进步，是咱们该拿来自勉并且自傲的。
