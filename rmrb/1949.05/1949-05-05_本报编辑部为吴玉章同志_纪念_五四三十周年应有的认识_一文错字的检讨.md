    The Editorial Department's Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in Comrade Wu Yuzhang's Article "The Understanding We Should Have in Commemorating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement"
    In Comrade Wu Yuzhang's article "The Understanding We Should Have in Commemorating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the 'May Fourth' Movement," published in our newspaper on May 4th, eight errors occurred. We hereby express our apologies to the author and the broad readership.

    The reasons for these errors, of course, are partially due to the temporary changes, page reversals, and processing that evening. However, the primary and fundamental reason is our carelessness and insufficient division of responsibilities. In other words, we lack the highest degree of comprehensive responsibility towards the Party newspaper. Our newspaper has consistently had typos, and each time they were discovered, we made self-criticisms and corrections. However, we have never been able to effectively eliminate typos. Why is this? First and foremost, we have not treated the elimination of typos as a political task to be deeply instilled in all cadres, workers, and every link of the process, to inspire all comrades with a proactive attitude and sense of responsibility towards eliminating typos. We have only made individual, "case-by-case" corrections and have never conducted in-depth ideological self-criticism to make everyone deeply aware of the seriousness of this error. Taking the recent period as an example, the following errors have occurred in our newspaper: First, two incorrect translations of the Eight Points of Attention of the People's Liberation Army. The editors blindly trusted the incorrectly translated text and did not raise any questions. Second, on May 1st, the third page contained a duplicate of Togliatti's speech in Turin, and the page layout was incorrect, but the editors did not notice. Third, some errors remained even after being corrected, such as mistaking "request" (要求) for "to want to come" (要来). As for the errors that occurred in the published article by Comrade Wu Yuzhang, they represent a peak. From these errors, we begin to realize that the phenomenon of typos is a serious disciplinary issue. Because any typo or incorrect symbol in the Party newspaper is enough to seriously damage the influence of the Party and the People's Government, causing unexpected political losses. Therefore, typos cannot be simply seen as technical oversights but should be seen as politically-tinged errors. Therefore, such errors cannot be easily let go; the facts must be investigated, responsibilities must be clearly defined, and they must be treated as disciplinary issues. In order to obtain the Party's supervision of the newspaper and correct this error with the help of the broad readership, the newspaper's editorial department, printing factory, radio stations, and other relevant parties must earnestly conduct self-criticism and inspections, and bring into play a high degree of political responsibility to resolutely eliminate typos.

    To eliminate typos, the following measures are stipulated for the future:

    1. Establish a strict responsibility system, clearly defining the responsibilities of all links, explaining the seriousness of adhering to the system from a political, ideological, and disciplinary perspective. Any errors that occur in the future will be investigated and punished in accordance with this system.

    2. Appoint a dedicated person in the printing factory, among the proofreaders and editors, to conduct systematic education (especially for newly liberated workers and staff, political education must be intensified), summarize the causes of past errors, and stipulate measures for the future.

    3. Implement strict, level-by-level inspections, learn from the lessons, and supervise the relevant parties to carefully correct the proofs after each revision, without any negligence. After the inspection is completed, signatures must be affixed to clarify responsibility.

### 本报编辑部为吴玉章同志“纪念‘五四’三十周年应有的认识”一文错字的检讨

    本报编辑部为吴玉章同志“纪念‘五四’
    三十周年应有的认识”一文错字的检讨
    本报五月四日发表吴玉章同志的“纪念‘五四’三十周年应有的认识”一文，发生了八处错字，在此，我们首先向作者及广大读者表示歉意。
    错误发生的原因，固然当晚的临时变动、倒版、加工都有着一定的影响；但主要的基本的原因，乃是我们工作粗心，分工负责不够，也就是我们对党报缺乏最高度的全面的责任心。我们的报纸曾经不断有错字，每次发现了，也都作了检讨和更正，但也从来没有能有效地消灭了错字，原因何在呢？首先是我们没有把消灭错字当成一个政治任务来在所有干部工人及一切环节中进行深刻的教育，启发全体同志对于消灭错字的积极性和责任心。我们只作过个别的“就事论事”的更正，从来没有深入地从思想上进行检讨，使大家深切认识这一错误的严重性。就以最近一个时期而言，在我们报上便发生了如下错误：一、是把人民解放军约法八章两处译错，编辑盲目地相信了译错的文字，丝毫未提出任何质疑。二、在五月一日第三版发现把托格里亚蒂在都灵演说新闻重复在一起，拚版有错，编辑也未看出来。三、也有的是改了而未检查以致错字仍在；如把“要求”错成“要来”等。至于这次刊载吴玉章同志的文章所发生的错误，则是一个登峰造极。由这些错误，我们开始认识到错字现象乃是一个严重的纪律问题。因为党报上错任何一个字，错任何一个符号，都足以严重损害党和人民政府的影响，造成政治上的意外的损失，因此，错字不能简单看做技术上的疏忽，而应看成带政治性质的错误；因此，对于这种错误不能轻轻放过，必须查明是非，严明责任，当作纪律问题处理。为了取得全党对报纸的监督，并在广大读者帮助下纠正这一错误，报纸编辑部、工厂、电台等各有关方面都必须认真地进行检讨检查，发挥高度政治责任心来坚决消灭错字。
    为了消灭错字，规定今后办法如下：
    一、建立严格的责任制度，明确规定一切环节应负的责任，从政治上思想上纪律上讲明遵守制度的严重性，今后发生任何错误均将遵循这一制度追究责任，给以应得的处分。
    二、指定专人在工厂中，在校对及编辑中进行系统的教育（特别对新解放的工人和职员要加紧进行政治教育），总结过去发生错误的原因，规定今后的办法。
    三、实行严格的逐级检查，接受教训，每次改完样子之后必须监督有关方面认真改正，不可稍有疏忽。检查完了，必须签字以明责任。
