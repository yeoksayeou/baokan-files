Taihang Fourth Special District
Spring River Management Experience

Our special district's spring river management project requires a total of over a million civilian laborers, which is a large-scale mass movement. The main experiences of each county in this stage of work are summarized as follows:

I. Sufficient preparatory work is essential: A. Conduct thorough measurements and accurately calculate and formulate a unified plan. B. Conduct sufficient ideological mobilization beforehand to ensure that the plan is understood by the masses. First, overcome the thinking of some district and village cadres and the masses who only see the severity of the disaster and the scale of the project, and lack confidence. As demonstrated by the facts in the sixth district of Wen County, the seventh district of Qinyang, and the fourth district of Bo'ai, although these districts were severely affected by the disaster, the morale of the masses was exceptionally high during river repair after good mobilization, and the river banks were well-built. C. Qinyang and Bo'ai both mobilized to step up sideline production before construction began to prepare for food and drink during river work. At the same time, in order to take care of the disaster situation, a rotation method was adopted. The more capable people in the village were allowed to go first, and those who did not have enough food and drink produced for a few more days before the next group went. In terms of war service, care was given to districts with severe disaster situations. These are all good methods.

II. Due to the severity of the disaster and the time for spring plowing and sowing, each county has adopted the method of careful preparation in advance, large-scale action once it starts, and striving to complete the project in a very short time. For example, as soon as the fourth and fifth districts of Bo'ai started construction, about 10,000 people participated, and the main village cadres of the fourth district participated in the leadership.

III. Adhere to the responsibility system and combine it with timely inspections. In the process of the movement, there must be strong publicity and encouragement work. A. Give each village specific tasks and strive for fairness. Most districts did this, which saved manpower and completed tasks earlier. Bo'ai adopted the method of assigning the village that suffered from a certain section of the river to build that section, and the effect was very good. B. Conduct strict inspections in a timely manner to ensure that tasks are completed according to standards. The civilian labor brigade in Wen County, in addition to setting up a brigade leader responsible for assigning civilian laborers and taking care of civilian laborers' lives, has a technical instructor responsible for technical guidance. C. More importantly, solve problems ideologically. Each county's squadron is equipped with an instructor who serves as a cultural officer to carry out propaganda and mobilization. The use of mass blackboards, red flag competitions, and other methods to promptly commend and criticize has a great effect.

IV. Mobilize women to participate in auxiliary labor. In the 28 villages in the sixth district of Wen County repairing the Guanlu River, there were 1,435 women participating in full and half labor. Many districts and villages have absorbed the chairwomen of women's federations to participate in the river management leadership work.

V. Strong organizational leadership is an important link to save manpower and ensure the completion of tasks. The cadres in the fifth district of Bo'ai did not pay enough attention to this work, and as a result, many villages were built not up to the required standards. In order to overcome the difficulties of few district cadres and heavy tasks, Wen County absorbed village cadres and experienced river management people to participate in the leadership of the district river management committee, so that the tasks were successfully completed.

VI. Several issues that still need attention at present: A. The masses in some villages did not dig to the standard, and the excavated soil was too close, with the mouth and bottom of the same width and too small a slope, which would inevitably collapse after water passed through. Even a small number of the masses were shoveling down from above, forming a river filling. Although many rivers and canals have been widened and dug up to the standard, the depth is far from the required standard. Some are dug several feet deep and the bottom is full of water, making it difficult to dig further. The solution to this problem in Wen County is to dig half of it first, leave a small earth ridge in the middle, and then divert the water into the previously dug half before digging the other half. Timely inspections must be carried out, and the established standards must be adhered to. The county should organize special personnel to inspect the repaired rivers, and if there are any problems, repair them immediately. B. Although the river has been widened, most of the bridges have not been renovated and enlarged, which can easily lead to disasters during summer floods. Bridges should be renovated and enlarged.

    太行四专区
    春季治河经验
    我专春季治河全部工程需民工约计百余万之多，这是一个大规模的群众运动。兹将各县这一段工作主要经验总结如下：
    一、事先要有充分的准备工作：甲、要进行很好的测量，准确计算订出统一的计划。乙、事先要进行充分的思想动员，使计划为群众所了解。首先要克服一部份区村干部与群众只看到灾荒严重工程大，缺乏信心的思想。如温县六区沁阳七区博爱四区的事实说明，这几个区虽灾荒很严重，但经过很好动员后，在修河中群众情绪是异常高涨的，河挑的都很好。丙、沁阳博爱都是在动工前动员加紧进行副业生产，准备了挑河时的吃喝，同时为了照顾灾荒，采取了轮流办法，开始让村里较有办法者先去，没吃喝的多生产几天，后一班去，在战勤上照顾灾情重的区，这些都是好的办法。
    二、由于灾情的严重，又值春耕下种时期，各县都采取了事先周密的准备，一旦开始便大规模的行动，争取在很短的时间内突击完成的办法。如博爱四、五两区一开工，便有一万人左右参加，四区主要村干部都参加领导。
    三、要坚持责任制的办法，结合及时检查，在运动过程中，要有强有力的宣传鼓励工作。甲、要给各村具体分工力求公平，大多数区这样做了既节省民力，完成任务又早。博爱在分工中采用了那村受那段河的害，便分给那村挑的办法，效果很好。乙、要及时进行严格检查，保证按标准完成任务。温县民工大队，除设大队长负责分派民工、照顾民工生活外，专设技术指导员一人，负责技术指导。丙、更重要的是从思想上解决问题，各县每一中队配备一个教员任文化干事进行宣传鼓动，运用大众黑板，夺红旗等办法，及时表扬批评起作用很大。
    四、发动妇女辅助劳力参加。温县六区二十八个村修官路河，参加的女全半劳力有一四三五个，不少区村吸收了妇女会主席，参加治河领导工作。
    五、强有力的组织领导，是节省民力保证完成任务的重要环节。博爱五区干部对这一工作重视不够，结果不少村修得不合乎要求标准。温县为了克服区干部少，任务繁重的困难，吸收村干部与有治河经验的群众参加了区治河委员会的领导工作，使任务顺利完成。
    六、目前尚需注意的几个问题：甲、有些村的群众，挖得不够标准，出土太近，口宽底宽一样，斜度太小，一过水必然塌陷进去。甚至有少数群众是从上边往下铲，形成填河。不少河渠虽然加宽上挖够标准了，但下深离要求标准甚远。有的下深几尺底下出水弄得满河是水，便不好再挖。温县解决这问题的办法是先挖好一半，中间留一小土棱，然后把水改入已挖好的前一半，再挖另一半。必须及时检查，坚持预订标准，已修好的河，县里要组织专人检查，如有毛病，立即补修。乙、河挖宽了但桥梁仍大多未改修加大，夏季发大水，易酿成灾，要改造加大桥梁。
