Responding to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's Call to Strengthen Unity
    Tianjin Public Factory Employees Review Their Tendency to Underestimate Workers

    [Tianjin Dispatch] Comrade Liu Shaoqi, a responsible person of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke to the employees of various public factories in Tianjin at Yaohua Middle School on April 25, calling for strengthening the unity of staff and workers and developing production. This speech was unanimously supported by the vast number of employees. Many factory employees made profound self-criticisms and frankly admitted that there are indeed many shortcomings in the relationship between staff and workers. Wen Runfang of Tianjin Clothing Factory said: "The old concepts of a few employees have not been completely changed for a while, and it is inevitable that a misconception will occur, thinking that the status of workers has improved, and it seems that their own status has been reduced. On the worker's side, some are unwilling to listen to the command of the staff when things happen, thus forming an internal opposition between the two sides." Regarding this fact, Bai Lunyan of the factory believes that the staff should bear more responsibility. He said: "The staff has always stood above the workers, considering themselves superior and despising labor. Therefore, once they have to respect and unite with the workers, they feel a little uncomfortable. This is obviously a mistake, but the general staff has long been accustomed to it under the past unreasonable social system and regarded it as natural. Now, although they say they are liberated, they are still not liberated ideologically and still maintain the old point of view, so they are unwilling to go deep into the worker masses to improve the relationship between staff and workers."

    After listening to Comrade Shaoqi's speech, Liu Xianglin of Tianjin Decoration Factory used "better than reading for ten years" to describe the enlightenment he gained. He said that staff should overcome past shortcomings and strengthen the unity of staff and workers. Xu Huimin of the factory also said: "All erroneous views that underestimate workers must be completely corrected. If there are places where we have been unfair to workers or things we have done wrong in the past, we must explain to the workers and ask for forgiveness. In the future, we must trust each other, work together, and jointly shoulder the task of developing production." After understanding that "under the leadership of the Communist Party, staff and workers are treated equally," Chen Maoqing excitedly said: "This will eliminate the doubts of a few employees and improve the relationship between staff and workers."

    Regarding the method of promoting the unity of staff and workers—correcting erroneous views and implementing self-criticism—the employees believe that this is the right medicine and is very important. Bai Lunyan said: "Workers are easy to approach. If the staff can stand with the workers, the workers will not discriminate against the staff and will trust the staff." Everyone agreed that removing bureaucracy and the superiority of the old intellectuals and correcting individualistic views are the keys to strengthening the unity of staff and workers. Regarding self-criticism, Hu Shaozheng of Tianjin Woolen Mill pointed out: "Some employees are wary. Some people are afraid of being punished after admitting their mistakes, and some people are afraid of losing face and no longer being able to lead workers in their work. At the same time, a small number of workers mistakenly regard the staff as the object of the revolution. Therefore, when conducting self-criticism, it is very necessary to make the staff fully understand the meaning of the staff and workers."

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech gave many employees confidence and encouraged their courage to review themselves.

    响应刘少奇同志加强团结号召
    天津公营工厂职员检讨轻视工人偏向
    【天津电】中共中央负责人之一刘少奇同志于四月二十五日在天津耀华中学对津市各公营工厂的职员讲话，号召加强职工团结，发展生产，这一讲话得到广大职员的一致拥护，许多工厂职员都深刻的作了自我检讨，并坦白承认：在职工关系中，目前确实还有许多缺点存在着，天津被服厂温润芳说：“少数职员的旧观念一时未能彻底改变，难免发生一种错觉，认为工人地位提高，就似乎是自身的地位降低，而工人方面也有的遇事不愿听职员指挥，遂形成双方内心的对立。”对于这一事实，该厂白伦严认为职员方面要多负一些责任，他说：“职员一向站在工人之上，自视优越，轻视劳动，因此一旦要与工人做互相尊重、团结，心里是有点不舒服的。这显然是一种错误，但一般职员在过去不合理的社会制度下，早已习非成是，视为固然，现在虽说解放了，但思想上仍未解放，仍保持着旧的观点，以致不肯深入工人群众，把职工关系搞好。”
    听了少奇同志的讲话，天津装具厂刘香霖用“胜读十年书”来形容他所获得的启示，他表示职员应当克服以往缺点，加强职工团结。该厂徐惠民也说：“一切轻视工人的错误观点，都要彻底改正，以前有对不起工人的地方，或做错的事，要向工人说明，请求原谅。今后必须互相信任，打成一片，共同担负起发展生产的任务。”陈茂卿在了解了“在共产党领导之下，对职工是一体看待的”之后，兴奋地说：“这样就使少数职员的疑虑消除，就能把职工关系搞好。”
    关于促成职工团结的方法——改正错误观点，实行自我批评，职员们认为这是对症下药，十分重要，白伦严说：“工人们是易于接近的，职员们如能和工人站在一起，工人们就不会歧视职员，就会信任职员的。”大家同意：去掉官僚作风与旧知识分子的优越感，改正个人主义的观点，是加强职工团结的关键。对于自我批评，天津制呢厂胡绍正指出：“有些职员是有戒心的，一部分人恐怕承认错误以后，会受惩罚，一部分人怕丢面子，再没有办法领导工人工作，同时也有少数工人错把职员当作革命的对象，因之在进行自我批评时，使职工充分了解职工的意义是十分必要的。”
    刘少奇同志的讲话，给予许多职员以信心，并鼓励了他们检讨自己的勇气。
