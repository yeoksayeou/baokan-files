Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st – According to a Prague dispatch from Diantong News Agency: A spokesman for Free Greece commented here on the 20th on the TASS statement regarding the Greek issue, stating: This statement is of historical significance to the Greek people because it expresses the Soviet Union's respect for the will of the Greek people's sovereignty and its determination to guarantee the integrity of Greek territory. This statement will surely delight all Greek people. The spokesman pointed out: The fact that the US and British representatives first raised the Greek issue in New York powerfully demonstrates that the foreign-directed movement to enslave the Greek people has met with a shameful defeat. Although this movement has cost Britain £400 million and is costing the United States $1 million every day, it has failed to achieve its goal. Now they clearly feel that the Democratic Army cannot be crushed; therefore, they are seeking a compromise rather than completely losing their position. The spokesman pointed out: The Greek democratic forces have always been in favor of peace and welcome recent peace efforts because these efforts have the solid guarantee proposed by the Soviet Union, and any solution reached will be democratic and just.

　　对苏联提出解决问题办法
  　希腊人民欢欣鼓舞
    相信有苏联的保证才能有民主与公正
    【新华社北平二十一日电】据电通社布拉格讯：自由希腊发言人于二十日在此间就塔斯社关于希腊问题声明发表评论称：这个声明对于希腊人民具有历史意义，因为它表示苏联尊重希腊人民主权的意愿，和保证希腊领土完整的决心。这个声明定将使一切希腊人民欢欣鼓舞。该发言人指出：美英代表这次首先在纽约提出希腊问题，这件事有力地说明了外国所指挥的奴役希腊人民的运动已遭到可耻的失败。这个运动虽已耗费了英国四亿英镑，并且正每天耗费美国一百万美元，但却未能达到目的。现在他们显然已经感到民主军是粉碎不了的，因此，他们正力求妥协而不愿完全丧失其阵地。发言人指出：希腊民主力量一向都赞同和平，而且欢迎最近的和平努力，因为这些努力有苏联所提出的坚实的保证，所达成的任何解决都将是民主与公正的。
