    Striving for Reasonable Student Relief
    The Ping Education Bureau Revises Relief Measures

    [This newspaper's report] When Beiping was liberated, the Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, in order to take care of students with financial difficulties in public and private secondary schools in Ping Municipality, jointly formulated temporary relief fund measures with the Beiping Student Union to provide relief to students in need. Now that the revolutionary situation is developing rapidly, those whose economic resources were cut off in the past due to the war can now reconnect with their families; also, due to insufficient investigation and research at the beginning, some who should not have been given relief were given relief. Therefore, the Municipal Education Bureau, in conjunction with the Municipal Student Union, the Municipal Youth Committee, the Municipal Student Committee, and the Municipal Federation of Middle and Primary School Teachers, carefully discussed this issue yesterday (the 14th) and re-stipulated specific temporary measures: (1) During the rectification period, the number of student relief quotas in each school must not be increased; students who have received relief in the past should be re-examined: those whose families are indeed poor should have written proof from the local street village or county/district People's Government. If it is temporarily impossible to obtain supporting documents, it can also be done with the proof of two-thirds of the students in the class. (2) Each school shall form a temporary review committee composed of the principal, representatives of the student union, faculty, and staff, and use a self-reporting and public discussion method to review, and then report to the Education Bureau for review. The review forms will be issued by the Education Bureau on the 15th. At the same time, the principals and student unions of each school should immediately convene a meeting to discuss this issue.

    救济学生力求合理
    平教育局重订救济办法
    【本报讯】北平解放时，本市人民政府教育局为照顾平市公私立中等学校经济困难的学生，曾会同北平学联拟定出临时救济费办法，对困难的学生进行了救济。现革命形势迅速发展，过去因战争关系断绝经济来源者，能与家庭取得连系；又因当初调查研究不够，有些不应救济的也救济了，因此市教育局特协同市学联、市青委、市学委、市中小学教联等于昨日（十四日）慎重讨论这一问题，重新规定出临时性的具体办法：（一）在整顿期间，各校学生救济名额不得再增；过去得到救济的学生应重新审查：家境确属贫寒应有当地街村或县区人民政府书面证明。如一时无法取得证明文件，经本班同学三分之二证明亦可。（二）各校由校长会同学生会教职员等代表组成临时审查委员会采用自报公议办法，审查后再呈报教育局审核。审核表格由教育局十五日发下。同时各校校长及学生会应即召开会议讨论此项问题。（柏生）
