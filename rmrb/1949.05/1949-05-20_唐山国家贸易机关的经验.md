　　The Experience of the Tangshan National Trading Organization
　　Editor's Note: News about the Tangshan state-owned trading organization combating unscrupulous merchants manipulating coal and flour coupons and safeguarding the lives of workers has already been published on page two, first item, of this newspaper on the 15th of this month. Please refer to it.
　　The experience of the Tangshan state-owned trading organization in combating unscrupulous merchants manipulating coal and flour coupons and safeguarding the lives of workers, which is published by this agency today, is one example of the anti-speculation struggles of state-owned trading organizations in many places recently. We believe this experience is worth promoting universally.
　　The Tangshan state-owned trading organization, in order to safeguard the interests of the broad masses of workers, resolutely struggled against unscrupulous merchants engaged in speculation and exploitation of workers with the cooperation of the trade union, using the economic strength of the state, and achieved many victories, which is undoubtedly correct. The task of state-owned trading organizations is originally to regulate the market, stabilize prices, support the cooperative undertakings of the working people, and guide private businesses onto a path that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so as to protect the lives of the broad masses of people and promote the development of public and private production; therefore, it is necessary to fight against the illegal and destructive behaviors of some private merchants. We advocate protecting all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and believe that legitimate private businesses have a certain importance today in connecting supply and demand between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad, but we must not have the slightest leniency towards any unscrupulous merchants who engage in speculation and disturb the market, and we must give their destructive activities a crushing blow. Taking Tangshan as an example, this small group of unscrupulous merchants made a profit of five or six times between buying and selling coal and flour coupons, and the workers' wages for five or six bags of flour became one bag. Could the state-owned trading organization sit idly by at this time and allow the workers to suffer such cruel exploitation? ! Yes, fighting against unscrupulous merchants is an arduous task, and the struggle may be very fierce from the beginning, requiring the mobilization of considerable economic strength and paying a certain price. But this is necessary. In order to give play to the role of state-owned trading organizations, it is completely right, when necessary, to buy workers' coal coupons at prices higher than the market price and sell food and daily necessities to workers at prices lower than the market price, as in Tangshan. The problem is that state-owned trading organizations must be good at constantly grasping the market situation, correctly estimating and deploying their own economic strength, fighting battles in a planned, assured, and step-by-step manner, avoiding rashness and blindness, and striving for victory in the economic struggle.
　　What is the significance of the Tangshan incident for private merchants? It tells private merchants that under the people's democratic regime, as long as private businesses can truly adjust surpluses and shortages and exchange materials, thereby promoting production, whether they are operating in the domestic market or engaging in import and export trade, the People's Government will not only not prohibit them, but will also guarantee them in accordance with the law and make it as easy as possible for them to obtain the necessary conditions for commercial activities. In fact, people's governments in various places have already taken many necessary measures in this regard. However, if they engage in speculative manipulation like those merchants in Tangshan who do not understand the overall situation, they will surely be severely hit by the economic strength of the state, resulting in both fame and fortune being lost. Tangshan is like this, and other places are the same. Even if some speculative private merchants in some places succeed for a while due to various reasons, if they do not wake up early and correct their mistakes, then their future will only be that the higher they climb, the harder they fall, and there will be no other ending. It is hoped that private businesses with capital in hand will quickly recognize right and wrong and use their intelligence and financial resources in the right way.
　　After this struggle, the Tangshan National Trading Organization summarized several valuable experiences, one of the most important of which is that it is necessary to organize workers' consumer cooperatives. Indeed, in important industrial and mining areas where workers are concentrated, such as Tangshan, trade unions must mobilize the broad masses of workers to organize consumer cooperatives in order to reduce the intermediate exploitation of merchants and protect the lives of workers. State-owned trading organizations should support workers' cooperatives and provide daily necessities such as grain, salt, oil, cloth, and fuel at low prices, and exchange workers' work tickets (in the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan, these are coal and flour coupons) to ensure that workers' in-kind wages are actually guaranteed. Because the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan did not have such a cooperative, the state-owned trading organization was unable to contact the workers through the cooperative. When fighting against the speculative manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, it had to temporarily establish a workers' coal depot. Although it exchanged coal coupons for the workers, it could not fully absorb flour coupons and serve the workers more. All localities should learn from the experience and lessons of Tangshan, actively promote the organization of workers' cooperatives, and especially seize the victory in the struggle against the speculative and destructive activities of unscrupulous merchants, protect the interests of workers, and immediately launch the organization of such cooperatives when the workers personally feel the help of the state-owned trading organization and realize the necessity of organized cooperation.

### 唐山国家贸易机关的经验

　　唐山国家贸易机关的经验
    编者按：关于唐山国营贸易机关打击操纵煤票面票的奸商，保障职工生活的新闻，已载十五日本报二版首条，请读者参阅。
    今日本社所发表的唐山国营贸易机关打击操纵煤票面票的奸商，保障职工生活的经验，是近来许多地方国家贸易机关反投机斗争的实例之一，我们认为这种经验值得普遍地推广。
    唐山国营贸易机关为了维护广大职工的利益，在职工会的协作下，运用国家的经济力量，与进行投机剥削工人的奸商坚决地斗争，并取得了许多胜利，无疑地是正确的。国营贸易机关的任务原本就在于调节市场，平稳物价，扶助劳动人民的合作事业，领导私营商业走上有利于国计民生的道路，以保障广大人民的生活，促进公私生产的发展；因此，便必须与某些私商的非法破坏行为做斗争。我们主张保护一切有利于国民生计的私营工商业，认为正当的私营商业在今天沟通城乡内外的供求关系上有其一定的重要性，但是对于任何投机倒把、扰乱市场的奸商，决不能有丝毫姑息，必须给他们的破坏活动以粉碎性的打击。以唐山为例，这一小撮奸商买卖煤票面票，一转手之间获利五、六倍，工人五、六袋面粉的工资变成了一袋，难道国家贸易机关这时候还能坐视不理，听任工人遭受这种残酷剥削吗！？是的，与奸商斗争是一件艰苦的工作，可能斗争一开始就会是很剧烈的，要调动相当大的经济力量，付出一定的代价。但这是必要的。为了发挥国家贸易机关的作用，必要时如唐山那样，以高于市价的价格收买工人煤票，以低于市价的价格卖给工人食粮和日用品，是完全应该的。问题只是在于国营贸易机关必须善于经常的掌握市场情况，正确地估计和调度自己的经济力量，做到有计划、有把握、有步骤地作战，避免鲁莽从事和盲目现象，争取经济斗争的胜利。
    唐山事件对于私商有什么意义呢？它告诉私商：在人民民主政权之下，私营商业无论经营内地市场或进出口贸易，只要真正能够做到调剂有无，交流物资，从而促进生产，人民政府不但不加禁止，而且依法予以保障，并尽可能使它们得到商业活动所需要的方便条件。事实上，今天各地人民政府已在这方面采取了许多必要的措施。但如果象唐山那些不明大义的商人那样，进行投机操纵的勾当，便一定会受到国家经济力量的严厉打击，结果必致名利两失。唐山如此，其他地方也是一样。即令有些地方的投机私商由于各种原因得逞于一时，如果不趁早觉悟，力改前非，那么他们的前途也只有爬得愈高，跌得愈痛，决不会有其他的下场。希望有资本在手的私营商业，赶快认清是非利害，把自己的智力财力运用到正当途径上去。
    唐山国家贸易机关在经过这场斗争之后，总结了几条有价值的经验，其中重要经验之一，是必须组织职工消费合作社。的确，在唐山那样工人集中的重要的工矿区，职工会必须动员广大职工，组织消费合作社，以减少商人的中间剥削，保障职工的生活。国家贸易机关应该扶助职工合作社，廉价供给以粮、盐、油、布、燃料等日常生活必需品，而收兑职工的工票（在唐山开滦煤矿就是煤票和面票），使职工的实物工资得到实际保障。唐山开滦煤矿因没有这种合作社，国家贸易机关无法通过合作社与职工联系，在与奸商的投机操纵行为做斗争时，不能不临时建立职工煤栈，虽然替职工收兑了煤票，但终不能尽量吸收面票，更多地为职工服务。各地应该吸取唐山的经验教训，积极推动职工组织合作社，特别应该抓紧对奸商投机破坏行为斗争胜利，保护了职工利益，职工们切身感到国家贸易机关的帮助，认识有组织合作社的必要时，立即发动组织这种合作社。
