Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th: The chemical industry in Northeast China currently has two-thirds of its factories either fully or partially resuming production, with some factories exceeding the production levels under Kuomintang rule. The large-scale Shenyang Chemical Factory's output of caustic soda and bleaching powder can meet the majority of the needs of the entire Northeast China paper industry, with both quantity and quality exceeding the standards under Kuomintang rule. The Fushun oil shale mine is now resuming mining operations. This mine contains 540 million tons of oil shale with an oil content of 5.5 percent. The Fushun Oil Shale Oil Plant has also recently begun production, with products including gasoline, kerosene, various lubricating oils, and waxes. The crude oil branch of the plant has already exceeded its production volume during Kuomintang rule by 50 percent. The sulfuric acid production of Fushun Sulfuric Acid Branch has more than doubled the output during Kuomintang rule. The Biziwo Seawater Chemical Factory of the Jilin Electrochemical Plant is currently producing large quantities of raw materials for potassium chloride and phosphorus sulfide. Other chemicals required by the pharmaceutical, rubber, dye, explosives, and fertilizer industries have also begun or are about to begin production. With the exception of the factories in Fushun and Anshan, which are directly managed by the Fushun Mining Bureau and Anshan Iron and Steel Company respectively, all other chemical plants in Northeast China are under the jurisdiction of the Chemical Bureau of the Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee. The current focus of the bureau's work is to further restore basic chemical industries such as oils and fats, coal coke, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. The Northeast region is rich in resources, providing many favorable conditions for the development of the chemical industry. For example, the Jilin Electrochemical Plant, located in the central area of several large coal mines in North Manchuria and East Manchuria, has great potential for development due to its abundant raw materials, superior hydropower, and relatively large and good equipment. The Jinxi sulfuric acid plant faces the seaport, with inexhaustible raw materials for salt, alkali, and acids, and is now preparing to establish an electrolytic salt plant.

    东北的化学工业大部分恢复生产
    设备好资源多发展有前途
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北化学工业目前已有三分之二的工厂全部或部分恢复生产，有些工厂已超过国民党统治时的生产水平。规模巨大的沈阳化学工厂所产的火碱与漂白粉，可供全东北造纸工业的大部需要，产量质量均超过国民党统治时的标准。抚顺油母页岩矿现正恢复开采。该矿蕴藏有含油百分之五点五的油母页岩量达五十四万万吨。抚顺油母页岩制油厂亦于最近开始生产，产品包括汽油、煤油、各种润滑油及腊等。该厂粗油分厂的生产量已超过国民党统治时期百分之五十。抚顺硫酸分厂的硫酸产量，则超过国民党统治时期一倍以上。吉林电化厂貔子窝海水化学工厂目前大量生产者有氯化钾的原料及硫化磷等。其他为医药、橡胶、染料、炸药及肥料等工业上所需的化学品，都已开始或即将开始生产。东北化学工业除抚顺、鞍山各厂分属抚顺矿务局与鞍山钢铁公司直接管理外，其余各厂均由东北行政委员会工业部化学管理局管辖。目前该局工作以进一步恢复油脂、煤焦子、硫酸、火碱等基本化学工业为主。东北地区资源丰富，发展化学工业具有许多便利条件。如位于北满与东满数大煤矿中心地区的吉林电化厂，因有丰厚的原料和优越的水电，并有较大较好的设备，因而发展前途甚大。锦西的硫酸厂面临海港，盐、碱、酸类之原料用之不竭，现亦准备建立一个电解食盐工厂。
