    【Tianjin Dispatch】The First North China Workers' Representative Congress victoriously concluded at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 11th). The congress agenda lasted ten days. All representatives, based on the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's call to "Strive for the Restoration and Development of Industrial Production," and the speeches and reports by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Li Lisan, and Li Zaiwen, engaged in extensive and enthusiastic discussions. In addition to offering opinions, they also formulated various resolutions and draft regulations based on the proposals made by representatives from various regions. Yesterday morning, the congress passed: 1. Comrade Li Zaiwen, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, presented a report on the "Current Tasks of the North China Labor Movement," which was adopted as a resolution of the congress. 2. A decision on the establishment of Factory Management Committees and Factory Workers' Representative Conferences in state-owned and public enterprises, along with draft implementing regulations. 3. A resolution on collective contracts for state-owned and public enterprises in North China, along with a draft outline for collective contracts. 4. A draft resolution on establishing supply stores and consumer cooperatives to ensure the livelihoods of workers. The above-passed resolutions 2, 3, and 4 will be submitted to the North China People's Government for approval and promulgation in the near future. In addition, the congress, through its presidium, based on the opinions of representatives during the discussions, made the following suggestions to the North China People's Government: 1. Establish labor bureaus in various provinces and cities, and labor sections in counties, based on the current state of industry. 2. Organize industrial restoration committees to plan the transition from wartime industry to peacetime industry. 3. Regarding the issue of income tax on wages and salaries. 4. Establish unified leading political power organs in major industrial and mining areas of North China. 5. Restore and establish workers' children's schools. Subsequently, Comrade Li Zaiwen, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, proposed that because the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has moved to Beiping, in order to strengthen the leadership of the labor movement, the establishment of a leadership organization of the North China Federation of Trade Unions can be dispensed with, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions can directly lead it. This suggestion was unanimously approved by the congress. Then, Comrade Zhao Guoqiang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a concluding speech. He first said: "This congress is unprecedented and successful in the history of the North China labor movement. The 525 representatives who attended included outstanding workers, labor heroes, factory directors, managers, and responsible cadres from North China enterprises, transportation, post and telecommunications, railways, cooperatives, trade, and other departments, who worked together with one heart and one mind to earnestly discuss the important issues of North China industrial construction and the labor movement, and finally passed resolutions and draft proposals on various major issues. Therefore, this congress is also a victorious congress of the solidarity of the working class in North China." Representatives from various regions submitted more than 700 proposals, which, after review by the proposal review committee, were merged into 159 items, classified into 13 categories according to their nature. After several reports and various resolutions of the congress, the various important issues raised were basically resolved. The needs for solving problems that are particular to individual departments and local, and are possible to solve, need to be sorted out by the Secretariat of the Congress and then transferred to relevant departments for joint discussion and implementation.
    The closing ceremony was held in the afternoon. First, Comrade Li Zaiwen, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a closing speech. In addition to congratulating the success of the congress, he succinctly pointed out: "After the representatives return to their posts, it is hoped that they will unite all workers based on the spirit of the congress and earnestly implement the resolutions of this congress." During free speech, Li Yongshun, an old worker from the "February 7th" era, happily took the stage to speak. He vividly described the heroic situation of the Zhengtai Railway strike at that time, as well as his personal support for the staff of the labor movement and the organization of trade unions, which won the respect and applause of the entire audience. During a temporary motion, one representative proposed: Telegraph Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu that the congress has been successfully concluded, and all representatives firmly respond to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's call to "Strive for the Restoration and Development of Industrial Production," and guarantee the completion of the historical tasks of this congress. Another representative proposed: Send a telegram to the front-line soldiers to celebrate the complete liberation of North China, and send a telegram of consolation to the workers in Nanjing, Taiyuan, Datong, Xinxiang, Anyang, and other recently liberated areas. Yet another representative proposed: In the name of the congress, pay tribute to all the farmers in North China who have long insisted on supporting the War of Liberation. All three motions were unanimously approved. The congress closed amidst cheers and slogans.

    下午举行闭幕式，首先由华北总工会筹委会主任栗再温同志致闭幕词。他除庆贺大会成功外，简洁的指出：“代表们回到自己岗位后，希望本着大会精神，把全体职工团结起来，认真执行这次大会的决议”。自由演讲时，“二七”时代老工人李永顺愉快地登台讲话，他生动地描述当时正太路罢工的英勇情形，以及他个人拥护职工运动工作人员与组织工会的事实经过，博得全场敬佩的掌声。临时动议时，一位代表提议：电告毛主席、朱总司令，大会已经胜利闭幕，全体代表坚决响应中共中央“为恢复和发展工业生产而奋斗”的号召，保证完成此次大会的历史任务。另一位代表提议：致电前方将士，庆祝华北完全解放，并电慰最近解放南京、太原、大同、新乡、安阳等地的职工们。又一位代表提议：用大会名义向华北全体长期坚持支援解放战争的农民致敬。三项动议、全体一致通过。大会在欢呼口号声中闭幕。
