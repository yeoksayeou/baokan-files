　　Suggest the Ping City Authorities Reopen "Jianguomen"
    Between the Dongbianmen and Chaoyangmen gates in Beiping city, the Japanese invaders opened a new gate during their occupation, which is now called "Jianguomen." It leads to the eastern suburban industrial area and, internally, via the East and West Mounting Hutongs, directly to East Chang'an Street. After the Kuomintang replaced the Japanese invaders in ruling Beiping, they closed this gate out of fear of attacks by the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, the eastern suburban industrial area was almost completely dismantled and sold off by them. Since the liberation of Beiping, there has been frequent traffic between merchants and civilians, and the relationship between urban and rural areas has become increasingly close. The eastern suburban industry has also begun to recover. However, because "Jianguo" Gate has not yet been opened, ordinary merchants and civilians entering and leaving the city must detour to Chaoyangmen, Dongbianmen, or even Guangqumen, wasting a lot of time. When the reporter was in the eastern suburbs asking for directions back to the city, several farmers working in the fields complained about the obstacles caused by the closure of this gate by the Kuomintang, and requested that it be reopened. Several workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory and two engineers from the People's Paper Mill also told the reporter that they hoped the municipal authorities would reopen "Jianguo" Gate to facilitate urban and rural transportation.

　　建议平市当局重开“建国门”
    北平城东便门与朝阳门之间，在日寇侵占时期，曾新开一门，现名为“建国门”。外通东郊工业区，内经东西裱褙胡同直通东长安街。自从国民党代替日寇统治北平后，因惧怕解放军的袭击，将此门封闭，同时东郊工业区也几乎为其拆卖净光。北平解放后，商民来往频繁，城乡关系日益密切，东郊工业也开始恢复。但因“建国”门尚未开放，一般商民进城出城，均须绕至朝阳门、东便门甚至广渠门，浪费许多时间。记者前在东郊问路回城时，即有好几个正在田中耕作的农民，纷纷诉说此门被国民党封闭后的阻碍，要求重新开放。华北农业机械厂的几个工人与人民造纸厂的两个工程师也对记者表示：希望记者能建议市政当局将“建国”门重新开放，以利城乡交通。（商恺）
