The masses have also bought 502 waterwheels and repaired 296 broken waterwheels. The Central Hebei Water Conservancy Promotion Society has loaned out 271 waterwheels. Cadres are also helping farmers overcome difficulties using various methods and carry out planting. According to statistics from 85 villages, more than 2,000 women have already joined mutual aid groups for planting.
