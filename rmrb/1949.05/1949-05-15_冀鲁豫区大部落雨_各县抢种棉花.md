    Heavy Rainfall in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    Counties Rush to Plant Cotton
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan region experienced heavy rainfall, and the sowing of sorghum and cotton has now been largely completed. As of the telegram sent on May 9th, the entire region, with the exception of the counties of Liaocheng, Boping, Renping, and Dong'e in the East Henan District, received spring rain. However, the amount of rainfall varied greatly. The Lake West District south of the Yellow River and the counties in Southwestern Shandong have received thorough rain, ensuring the sowing of both early and late seedlings. In the North Henan District, Gaoling, Junxian, and Yanjin only received about two finger-widths of rain, but sorghum is expected to sprout. Changyuan, Fengqiu, Yangwu, and Hua County received enough rain for a plough, ensuring the sprouting of small seedlings. In the West Henan District, Juye, Jiaxiang, Jining, and the southern part of Nanwang received four finger-widths of rain, which is barely sufficient for sowing. In the Southern Zhili District, Qingfeng, Weihe, Nanle, Neihuang, and Puyang only received two to three finger-widths of rain. Shou Zhang, Yanggu, Fan County, Chaocheng, and Puyang, only had the surface of the soil moistened. After the rain, all counties actively led the rush to plant, and the sowing of sorghum and cotton has been completed. It is expected that the original plan to complete 1.5 million mu of cotton sowing will be achieved. Efforts are now being organized to vigorously plant peanuts and millet, striving to achieve the sowing plan of one million mu of peanuts. However, due to the incomplete solution of seed problems, there are still many difficulties in achieving the plan. The enthusiasm of the masses for production is unprecedented in recent years, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased compared to last year. Approximately 30% of wheat fields have been weeded.

    Since April, the insect pests that have occurred in various places cannot be said to have had no impact on this year's production increase plan. Insect pests have occurred in six counties including Shan County and Ande, but the affected areas are not large, and with timely organization and control, they have not spread. The mole crickets that occurred in Shan County were completely eliminated in a very short period of time. More than fifty villages in Pei County, more than ten villages in Yuncheng, and seven or eight villages in Yunju have been hit by hail, but because the crops are still in the sowing period, the impact is not significant. Those seedlings that were damaged by the hail have been replanted.

    冀鲁豫区大部落雨
    各县抢种棉花
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫所属地区大部落雨，现已大体完成高粱与棉花的播种，截至五月九日发电时止，该区除运东区所属之聊城、博平、荏平、东阿等县外，全区普获春雨，但雨量大小，极不一致，黄河南之湖西区及鲁西南各县，均已下透，早苗晚苗播种，均有保证。豫北区高陵、浚县、延津等地仅下二指。高粱可望出土。长垣、封邱、阳武、滑县有一犁雨，小苗出土可以保证。运西区巨野、嘉祥、济宁、南旺南部落雨四指，可勉强下种。直南区清丰、卫河、南乐、内黄及濮县均仅二三指雨。寿张、阳谷、范县、朝城、濮阳等地，仅湿地皮。雨后各县积极领导抢种，高粱棉花播种，均已完毕，预计棉花播种可能完成一百五十万亩之原订计划，现正组织力量，突击播种花生、谷子，花生争取实现一百万亩之播种计划，但因种籽未获完全解决，实现计划尚有不少困难。群众生产热情为历年来所未有，施肥量比去年增加，经锄麦地约占百分之三十。
    四月份以来，各地所发生的虫害，对于今年的增产计划来说，不能说是没有影响的，发生虫害的县份有单县、安德等六县，但波及地区不大，而且有领导上的及时组织捕打，未能蔓延。单县所发生的蝼蛄，在很短时间内，全部消灭。沛县五十余村，郓城十余村，郓巨七、八个村，均曾落冰雹，但因目前作物尚在播种期，影响不大，有出苗被打坏的，均已组织改种。
