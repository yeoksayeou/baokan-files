　　Suiyuan-Mongolia Government Grasping Farming Season
  　Intensifying Leadership in Drought Resistance and Planting
    [Suiyuan-Mongolia Dispatch] Since spring and summer, the Suiyuan-Mongolia region has generally experienced severe drought without rain. Although Fengzhen and Liangcheng have had some rain, the amount is insufficient. In order to seize the farming season and expedite planting, the Suiyuan-Mongolia government has issued the following instructions to its subordinates: (1) Urgently mobilize the masses to break away from the mentality of relying solely on the heavens. In areas where rain has fallen, seize the moisture to plant. In areas where it has not rained, immediately dry-plant, deeply plow, and shallowly bury the seeds. Also, call for the extensive planting of early-maturing crops. (2) Governments at all levels and local production committees should organize forces to mobilize all Party and government cadres to go to the countryside to lead the masses in expediting planting. (3) Mobilize all staff members of government organs and soldiers, as well as all animal power, to assist the masses in delivering manure, plowing fields, and sowing seeds in a planned and uncompensated manner. (4) Actively mobilize the masses to dig wells and open canals. If the masses genuinely lack the strength to dig, budgetary plans can be drawn up, and the People's Bank can provide loans for assistance.

　　绥蒙政府掌握农时
  　加紧领导抗旱下种
    【绥蒙电】绥蒙地区春夏以来，普遍亢旱无雨，丰镇、凉城虽落雨但雨量不足，绥蒙政府为了掌握农时加紧抢种，特指示所属：（一）紧急动员群众，打破靠天吃饭思想，已落雨的地方，抢湿下种，未落雨的地方，立即干种，深犁浅埋。并号召大量种早熟作物。（二）各级政府和各地生产委员会，组织力量，动员所有党政干部下乡，领导群众进行抢种。（三）动员各机关勤杂人员和战士，以及所有畜力，有计划的无代价的帮助群众送粪、犁田、播种。（四）积极动员群众，掘井开渠，如群众确无力量开凿者，可拟出预算计划，由人民银行贷款扶助。
