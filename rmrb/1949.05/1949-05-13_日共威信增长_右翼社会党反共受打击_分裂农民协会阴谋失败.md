Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 12th: According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency: Unable to maintain leadership due to setbacks in their anti-communist activities, a minority faction of the right-wing Socialist Party of Japan has withdrawn from the Japan Farmers' Association. This association, with 1.7 million members, has long been a central organization in the democratic struggle in Japanese villages. The Socialists launched this split on the eve of the association's annual meeting, at a Central Committee meeting, when their demand to adopt anti-communism as an official policy was rejected by the majority. The Communist and Labor-Farmer Party members of the Central Committee firmly advocated freedom of political action and argued that the Farmers' Association should not be monopolized by the Socialist Party. The Socialists withdrew from the association and organized their own bogus conference, but only managed to attract 200 of the 450 delegates attending the regular conference. It is acknowledged here that the Socialists instigated the split because their influence in the Japan Farmers' Association was declining, whereas previously they had controlled it. The elections in January showed that the influence of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in rural areas has been growing, with the best elements of the Socialist Party either joining the Communist Party or forming a separate progressive Labor-Farmer Party. Riita Toshio, an old leader of the farmers' movement and one of the organizers of the Labor-Farmer Party, has been re-elected as chairman of the Japan Farmers' League.

    Meanwhile, the continuous growth of the JCP's influence in trade unions has been demonstrated by the recently held annual meeting of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union. Although the anti-communist Kato Etsuo was re-elected as chairman, a progressive trade union worker was elected as general secretary, and a communist was elected as vice-chairman. The new committee includes eight communists, seven progressives, and ten so-called "Democratization League" anti-communists. In the original committee, anti-communists held a majority of seven-tenths of the total members. The annual meeting rejected the right-wing proposal demanding that this union, with 600,000 members, withdraw from the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions, which recently joined the World Federation of Trade Unions. The annual meeting adopted a militant program to struggle "against the Yoshida government's comprador policies."

    日共威信增长
    右翼社会党反共受打击
    分裂农民协会阴谋失败
    【新华社北平十二日电】据电通社东京讯：由于反共活动遭受打击，无法把持领导，日本右翼社会党少数派已退出日本农民协会。该协会拥有会员一百七十万人，一向是日本乡村民主斗争的中心组织。社会党人是在该协会年会前夕，在中央委员会会议上当他们所提出的通过反共作为正式政策的要求被多数否决时，才发动这一分裂行动。该中央委员会的共产党及工农党委员，坚主政治行动自由，主张农民协会不应被社会党垄断。社会党人退出协会，并布置他们自己的伪大会，但仅只拉拢到参加正规大会代表四百五十余人中的二百人，此间承认，社会党之所以制造分裂，是因为他们在日本农民协会中的影响益趋下降，而在以前，该协会曾是他们所把持的。一月间的选举表明，日共在农村的影响一直在增长，社会党中最优秀的分子或已参加共产党，或已另组进步的工农党。农民运动的老领袖，工农党的组织者之一的里田寿男已再度当选为日本农民联盟主席。
    同时，日共在工会中的影响的不断增长，已为最近举行的日本国营铁道工人工会年会所证明，反共的加藤悦男虽然连任主席，但进步的工会工作者当选为总书记，共产党人当选为副主席。新的委员会中有共产党员八人，进步分子七人，所谓“民主化同盟”的反共分子十人。在原来的委员会中反共分子占全体委员数十分之七的多数。年会否决了右派的建议，该建议要求这一拥有六十万会员的工会，退出最近加入了世界工联的全日联工会。年会通过了“与吉田政府的买办政策”斗争的战斗性纲领。
