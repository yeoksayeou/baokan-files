[Report from This Newspaper] Students at national universities in Ping City are currently engaged in heated and earnest discussions and evaluations of the People's Stipends. After discussions, many students have clarified their thinking about serving the people and have voluntarily given up applying.

At Tsinghua University, over 1,800 students were divided into more than 140 groups to discuss the interim regulations on People's Stipends. They recognized that the essence of the old public funding was a despicable conspiracy by the Kuomintang reactionaries to deal with patriotic students, while the People's Stipends were the blood and sweat of the people who tightened their belts to cultivate talent for the construction of the new China. Therefore, some students sold their bicycles to withdraw their applications. Some students originally planned to sell their fourteen vacuum tubes, radios, etc., to pay for expenses, but considering that they might fall into the hands of the pleasure-seeking parasitic class, they decided to donate these beloved items to organs or factories that needed them and apply for the People's Stipends themselves. The formal departmental group evaluation work is still in progress.

After clarifying their thinking, students at Peking University also consciously abandoned the erroneous idea that "stipends are an inherent right," and voluntarily gave up applying or lowered their application levels. For example, the initial number of applicants at the Sha Tan Agricultural College was 90 percent. After group discussions, the number of those applying for Class A stipends was reduced from 34 to 18, and two applicants for Class B changed to Class C. They also proposed mutual aid methods, with two students combining, one applying for Class A and the other for Class B, and sharing the stipend equally. They said, "It's good to save even a pound of millet for the people." This method was first echoed by fourth-year students in the Law Department. Other departments, such as the fourth-year Chinese Department, Geology Department, and Education Department, also had students voluntarily giving up applications. As of yesterday, among more than 1,900 students at Peking University, about 1,400 had submitted applications, and recently some have continued to voluntarily give up applying.

The Beiping Art School formed a stipend evaluation committee composed of professor representatives and student representatives. Initially, among more than 210 students in the school, more than 180 applied. After preliminary ideological preparation and discussion, 21 students voluntarily gave up. Discussions are currently continuing.

　　清华北大等校学生
  　热烈评议助学金
    明确人民是用血汗助学　许多学生自动放弃申请
    【本报讯】平市国立大学学生现正热烈、严肃展开人民助学金的讨论和评议。许多学生在经过讨论后明确了为人民服务的思想，纷纷自动放弃申请。
    清华大学全体学生一千八百余人，分成了一百四十多个小组，展开了关于人民助学金暂行条例的讨论。他们认清了旧公费的本质是国民党反动派对付爱国学生的卑劣阴谋，而人民助学金则是人民节衣、缩食培养新中国建设人才的血汗，因此有的同学为了退让申请，出卖了他的自行车，有的同学原打算把自己的十四个真空管，收音机等卖掉，以缴纳费用，但又考虑到可能落到享乐寄生阶级的手里，就决定把这些心爱的东西捐献给需要用的机关或工厂，自己来申请人民助学金。现正式的系级小组评议工作还在继续进行。
    北京大学学生，在思想搞通后也自觉地抛弃了“助学金是应享的权利”的错误观念，纷纷自动放弃申请或降低申请等级。如沙滩农学院学生最初申请者为百分之九十，经过小组讨论后，三十四个申请甲种助学金的减为十八个，有两个申请乙种的改为丙种，他们又提出互助办法，两个同学合并起来，一个申请甲等，一个申请乙等，互相平均分配，他们说：“能为人民省一斤小米也是好的”。这办法，首先得到法律系四年级同学的响应。其他如中文系四年级、地质系、教育系等也都有同学自动放弃申请，至昨日为止，北京大学一千九百余人中，提申请者一千四百人左右，而近日已有人陆继放弃申请。
    北平艺术专科学校由教授代表和学生代表合组成助学金评议会，最初全校二百一十余人中，申请者一百八十余人，后经初步思想酝酿和讨论，自动放弃者二十一人，现正继续展开讨论中。
