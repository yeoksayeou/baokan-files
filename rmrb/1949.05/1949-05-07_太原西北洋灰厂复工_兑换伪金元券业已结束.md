    【Taiyuan Electric】The renowned Northwest Cement Plant officially resumed production at 7:00 AM on the 2nd. By 5:40 PM, one finished powder machine produced a total of 55.1 tons, averaging 5.12 tons per hour, an increase of 1.42 tons per hour compared to pre-liberation levels. Worker Zhao Xiaojia said: "In the past, I often dozed off at work, and I pretended not to see even minor machine malfunctions. Now that we are producing for ourselves, I wouldn't doze off even if I worked consecutive shifts day and night."
    【Taiyuan Electric】The exchange of fake Gold Yuan notes in the city lasted seven days and concluded on May 2nd. The exchange work proceeded smoothly. The people of the city actively participated in the exchange, and merchants all competed to use Renminbi and refused to use the fake Gold Yuan notes. In order to complete the exchange quickly, the bank set up exchange offices in the city and sent mobile exchange teams to the rural areas outside the city. In seven days, a total of 554,975 yuan in Renminbi was exchanged. Many people also voluntarily took out silver dollars and raw gold and silver to the bank to exchange for Renminbi. During this exchange, a total of 7,739 workers, students, impoverished city residents, middle and poor peasants, and teachers enjoyed preferential treatment. All sectors of the city's population expressed strong support for the exchange work.

    太原西北洋灰厂复工
    兑换伪金元券业已结束
    【太原电】著名的西北洋灰厂，已于二日晨七时正式复工生产。下午五点四十分钟，一部成品粉末机共制成品五十五·一吨，每小时平均生产五·一二吨，较解放前每小时增加产量一·四二吨。工人赵小假说：过去工作时常打盹，机器出了小毛病还装没有看见，现在为自己生产，让我昼夜连班干也不会打盹了。
    【太原电】本市伪金元券兑换历时七天，已于五月二日结束。此次兑换工作进行颇为顺利，全市人民踊跃兑换，商贩均争用人民币，拒用伪金元券。银行为了迅速兑换完毕，在市内设立兑换所及派流动兑换组，到市外农村区进行兑换，七天来共兑出人民币五十五万四千九百七十五元。并有许多群众自动拿出白洋，生金银到银行兑换人民币。此次兑换中共有七千七百三十九名工人，学生，贫苦市民，中贫农，教职员享受到优待。全市各阶层人民对兑换工作极表拥护。
