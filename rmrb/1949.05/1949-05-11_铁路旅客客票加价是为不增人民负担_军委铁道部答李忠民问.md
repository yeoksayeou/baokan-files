    Railway Passenger Ticket Price Increase Is to Avoid Increasing People's Burden
    Military Commission Railway Ministry Answers Li Zhongmin's Question
    The Railway Ministry of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission recently answered Mr. Li Zhongmin regarding the increase in railway passenger ticket prices, as follows: Mr. Li Zhongmin:
    Regarding the issue of increased railway passenger ticket prices, we will now analyze and answer your views in your letter as follows:
    The Kuomintang reactionaries, violating the people's will, launched an anti-people civil war, causing enormous disasters to the people of the whole country, and causing enormous losses to the country's financial and material resources. The railways also suffered extremely serious damage from the Kuomintang reactionaries. In order to crush the offensive of the reactionary army, to end the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries for more than 20 years, and to liberate all of China, we should transport the victorious army to the south of the Yangtze River, complete the great task mentioned above, and further develop the national economy of the liberated areas, so that cities and villages, domestic and foreign, can be connected in all directions. The people of our liberated areas, especially the railway workers, should shoulder this glorious responsibility. Our people's government has invested considerable funds in the railways, mobilizing many workers, peasants and railway employees to repair them day and night, so that the railways have achieved their current achievements.
    You say that "Railways are national enterprises, and their purpose is originally to facilitate people's transportation. Today, the price increase of passenger tickets by two times will inevitably affect the lives of the poor." It is true that railways are state-owned enterprises, and they must serve the people's war of liberation and the development of the national economy in the liberated areas; however, railways must also maintain a certain level of health, that is to say, in addition to relying on a certain amount of government investment, railways should also appropriately collect certain freight fees from customers, provided that it does not affect people's livelihood and is lower than the prices of other modes of transportation. If, as you say, railways should transport at low prices without principle, then the general public and people who do not take the train or take it less often will suffer. Because railways need to be maintained and developed, when funds are insufficient, they must be taken from the broad masses of people in the liberated areas. If this is done, it is equivalent to the railway taking money from the hands of people who do not take the train, while allowing those who need to take the train to do so at low prices. From this, it can be seen that it is inappropriate for railways to transport at low prices without principle.
    You mentioned that the increase in freight rates "affects the lives of the poor," but this is not always the case. If the poor migrate to participate in production, or organized transportation that directly benefits the poor's production, the railway can reduce transportation prices with the joint approval of the People's Government and the Railway Bureau. If freight rates are low, some poor people may take the train to engage in speculative buying and selling, which would encourage practices that do not increase social wealth, which is even more inappropriate. According to the statistics of the Pingjin Railway Bureau in April, government and educational personnel accounted for 19 percent of the passenger composition, students accounted for 15 percent, workers accounted for 12 percent, farmers accounted for 15 percent, and merchants accounted for 35 percent. From the above analysis, the proportion of merchants is larger, while the number of truly hardworking poor people taking the train is very small.
    From the above situation, we believe that your opinions lack comprehensive consideration and analysis.
            Railway Ministry of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, May 6th

    铁路旅客客票加价是为不增人民负担
    军委铁道部答李忠民问
    中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部顷为铁路客票加价事，答李忠民先生，文如下：李忠民先生：
    关于铁路旅客客票加价问题，现在我们就你来信观点分析并解答如下：
    国民党反动派违背人民意志，发动反人民的国内战争，全国人民遭受极大灾难，国家财力物力遭受极大损失，铁道同样也遭受到国民党反动派极严重的破坏。我们为了粉碎反动派军队的进攻，为了要结束国民党反动派二十余年的黑暗统治，并解放全中国起见，应把胜利的大军运到江南，完成上面所说的伟大任务，并进一步去发展解放区的国民经济，使城市与乡村，国内与国外，四面八方都互相联结起来。我们解放区的人民，特别是铁路员工，都应负起这样光荣的职责。我们的人民政府，已用了相当多的经费，投资于铁路，动员不少的工农群众和铁路员工，昼夜抢修，才使铁路获得了目前的成绩。
    你说“铁路为国家企业，其目的原为便利人民交通，今天旅客票价加价二倍，不免影响贫民生活。”不错，铁路是国营企业，它要为人民解放战争和发展解放区国民经济服务；但铁路也要维持它一定的健康，那就是说铁路除了靠政府一定经费投资外，在不影响民生和低于其他交通工具运价情况之下，要适当的收顾主一定的运费。按若你说铁路应该无原则的去以低价运输，那么，一般贫民和不乘车或少乘车的人是要吃亏的。因为铁路要维持与发展，在经费不足时，就要取之于解放区广大的人民。若这样做的话，就等于铁路在不乘车人的手里把钱拿来，而低廉的叫需要乘车的人乘车。从这里可以看出铁路无原则的以低价运输是不妥当的。
    你提到运费加价，“影响贫民生活”，其实并不都是如此。若贫民因迁移去参加生产，或于贫民直接生产有益的有组织的运输，经人民政府与铁路局共同批准，铁路可以减价运输。若说运费低廉，一些贫民可乘车倒弄买卖，这样是鼓励不增加社会财富的做法，更不适当。根据四月份平津铁路局的统计，旅客成份中，公教人员占百分之十九，学生占百分之十五，工人占百分之十二，农人占百分之十五，商人占百分之三十五。从以上分析，商人所占比例数较大，而真正劳苦贫民乘车为数倒是很少的。
    从以上这些情况来看，我们认为你所提的意见，缺少全面的考虑与分析。
            中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部五月六日
