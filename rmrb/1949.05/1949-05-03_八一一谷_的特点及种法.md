Characteristics and Cultivation Methods of "811 Millet"
    Changzhi Agricultural Experiment Station

    I. Characteristics and Yield of "811 Millet"

    "811 Millet" is an excellent variety bred successfully by Yenching University in Beiping before the Anti-Japanese War. Because its number in the experiment station was 811, it is called "811 Millet." This millet was collected from a few seeds and cultivated and propagated in the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region in 1942. It has been tested in this area for several years, and all growth conditions are very suitable.

    According to the results of our farm's six-year experiment, this millet yields more than various millet varieties that have participated in the experiment over the years, with a yield per mu approximately 20% to 30% higher than other varieties.

    In mass planting, according to the survey data of five villages such as Guobao and Liulin in Changzhi, 15 households planted "811 Millet" on 18 mu and 5.5 li, with an average expected yield of 1 shi, 4 dou, and 2 sheng per mu, and an actual yield of 1 shi, 5 dou, and 6.9 he, resulting in an increase of 1 dou and 4.9 he per mu; 16 households planted local millet on 49 mu and 8 fen, with an average expected yield of 1 shi, 4 dou, and 5.1 he per mu, and an actual yield of 1 shi and 2 dou and 7 sheng, resulting in a decrease of 1 dou and 8.1 he per mu. "811 Millet" increased yield by 19% per mu compared to local millet. Last year, Xiangyuan County planted a lot, but because the climate was not suitable and the masses did not master the technology, the yield was roughly the same as local millet.

    "811 Millet" has thin skin and produces more rice; for example, Han Caixian from Hanchuan Village in Changzhi milled 1 dou of "811 Millet" and yielded 7 sheng of rice, while milling 1 dou of "Hen's Beak" millet (local millet) only yielded 6 sheng of rice. "811 Millet" grains are small, yellow, and tasty.

    Based on several years of trial planting, its characteristics are numerous tillers (strong tillering ability), with each root able to produce five to eight plants, and the ears on these tillers can all bear fruit and mature, so the yield is high. In particular, it is resistant to wind, less prone to lodging in the field, and does not suffer from white hair disease (pith necrosis); its disadvantages are that it is susceptible to two diseases, black smut and red hair disease (cereal nematode disease), especially red hair disease, which affects about 1% to 2%.

    II. How to Plant "811 Millet"?

    1.  Sowing period: It has strong adaptability and can adjust the growing season according to the climate. Because the climate is different in various places, the sowing time is closely related to the maturity time. The maturity time is late in cold places and early in warm places. Sowing is divided into spring sowing and summer sowing: spring sowing, such as in Changzhi, should be sown between Grain Rain and Beginning of Summer, requiring 150 days to mature; Licheng (warmer) should be sown during the Lesser Fullness, maturing in about 120 days. Summer sowing, such as in Xingtai and Cixian, where the weather is hot, can plant stubble millet after the wheat harvest, maturing in about 90 days. After harvesting, it does not delay planting wheat, which is a significant manifestation of its strong adaptability. The general sowing period follows the local millet seasons.

    2.  Soil quality: As long as it is not sandy soil, it can grow in red soil, white soil, and black soil. However, red soil and white soil are not as fertile as black soil, and they produce fewer tillers.

    3.  Land preparation: Same as local millet, deep plow once in the autumn of the previous year, and start spring plowing after the ground thaws. Harrow the land well to ensure that there are no soil clods, and then plant. Soil that has been plowed and harrowed in this way is compact and easy to retain moisture, and millet seedlings emerge evenly.

    4.  Fertilization: It is best to apply well-rotted mixed fertilizer (sheep and horse manure, compost, etc.), 25 loads (50 dan) to 30 loads (60 dan) per mu, similar to local millet. Method: Spread it evenly on the ground before spring plowing, and then plow it in so that the fertilizer is turned into the soil, and then sow.

    5.  Seed treatment: The amount of seeds to use depends on the quality of the land, the size of the clods, and the sowing time. Good land requires one jin, poor land requires one and a half jin, early sowing requires one and a half jin, and late sowing requires one jin. The seeds should be rinsed with clean water to float away the empty seeds, and the sunken seeds should be sown so that the seedlings emerge neatly.

    6.  Sowing method: Sowing methods vary from place to place. Some places use a three-legged drill, and some use a two-legged drill. According to our years of experience, because of its strong tillering ability and large root stubble, it is best to use a two-legged drill. This can spread the plants out, grow them vigorously, and save labor.

    7.  Thinning: Because of its strong tillering ability, thinning should be done when the seedlings are two or three inches tall. If thinning is done too late, it is easy to grow weeds. The distance between seedlings should be determined according to the fertility of the land. Otherwise, dense spacing on fertile land and sparse spacing on poor land will affect its growth and development and yield. If using a two-legged drill with a one-foot wide spacing, the spacing should be 1.2 chi (market chi) on first-class land, 8 cun to 1 chi on second-class land, and 6 cun to 8 cun on third-class land. Regardless of the type of drill used, leave single plants.

    8.  Middle tillage (weeding): After the seedlings emerge and grow to more than three inches high, start weeding the first time. Some people thin the seedlings first and then weed, while others thin and weed at the same time. When weeding the first time, the plant begins to tiller, only break the surface of the soil. Do not surround the base of the seedling with soil, as surrounding it will hinder tillering or result in very little tillering, affecting the yield. When the seedlings are one chi tall, it is okay to surround the roots with some soil when weeding the second time. Surround the roots with enough soil for the third weeding. The three weedings must be carried out before heading (when the seedlings are two chi tall) to avoid damaging the seedlings.

    III. "811 Millet" Also Needs Seed Selection

    Although millet is not easily cross-pollinated, if it is mixed with other millet varieties, the maturity time will be staggered, making it difficult to manage, and it will also cause diseases and reduce yield. Therefore, when the millet is fully mature, go to the field to select ears with many tillers, long and thick stalks, and plump grains. Regardless of how much seed is selected, pay attention to using a threshing ground that has not been used for threshing millet to avoid mixing the seeds and transmitting germs.

    Now, most of the "811 Millet" planted in various places is mixed and impure. When selecting seeds, to distinguish what is pure "811 Millet," you must first understand its characteristics, which is that the glumes have hairs that are curved.

    “八一一谷”的特点及种法
    长治农业试验场
    一、“八一一谷”特点及产量
    “八一一谷”是抗战以前北平燕京大学育种成功的一个优良品种，因为在试验场里编的号数是八百一十一号，所以叫做“八一一谷”。这个谷子是一九四二年在晋冀鲁豫边区农林局时搜集到的几粒种籽培育繁殖起来的，在本区试种几年，一切生长条件都很适合。
    这种谷子经我们农场六年试验的结果，比历年参加试验的各种谷子产量大，每亩产量较其他品种的产量约增收百分之二十至三十以上。
    在群众中的种植，如长治郭堡、柳林等五个村的调查材料，有十五户种“八一一谷”十八亩五分五厘，每亩平均应产量一石四斗二升，实产量一石五斗六升九合，每亩增收一斗四升九合；有十六户种本地谷四十九亩八分，每亩平均应产量一石四斗五升一合，实产量一石二斗七升，每亩减产一斗八升一合。“八一一谷”较本地谷每亩增收百之分十九。去年襄垣县种的很多，因风土不适宜，群众又没有掌握技术，产量和本地谷大致相同。
    “八一一谷”皮薄，出米多；如长治韩川村韩彩仙，碾了一斗“八一一谷”，就出了七升米，又碾了一斗母鸡嘴谷（本地谷）才出了六升米，“八一一谷”米粒小、又黄、又受吃。
    根据几年的试种，它的特点是发杈多（分蘖力强），每根能支生五棵到八棵，这些支杈上的穗子，都能结实成熟，所以产量大。特别是抗风力强，在地里倒伏少，也不生白发病（芦心病）；它的缺点就是易生乌霉病（黑穗病）和红毛病（粟线虫病）两种，尤其是红毛病更厉害，约有百分之一、二。
  二、怎样种“八一一谷”？
    １、播种期：它的适应性很强，能根据气候冷热伸缩生长期，因为各地气候不一样，他的下种时期与成熟迟早很有关系，冷的地方成熟迟，暖的地方成熟早。下种分为春播与夏播两种：春播如长治，应在谷雨立夏间下种，需百五十日成熟；黎城（较暖）则在小满节下种，约百二十日左右成熟。夏播如邢台、磁县等处天气热，麦收后能种麦茬谷，约九十日左右成熟，待收获后，仍不误种麦，这是它的适应性强的显著表现。一般的播种期，根据当地谷的节令下种就行。
    ２、土质：只要不是沙土地，不管红土、白土、黑土地都能生长。但是红土与白土地不如黑土地长的肥，支杈多。
    ３、整地：和本地谷一样、在头年秋天先深耕一次，待地解冻后开始春耕，用耙耙好，务使没有土块，然后再种。这样耕耙过的地，土粒紧密，容易养ｃｈǒｎｇ＠①，谷苗容易出齐。
    ４、上粪：上沤好的混合肥料（羊马圈肥堆肥等）最好，每亩上二十五驮（五十担）到三十担（六十担），和本地谷差不多。用法：于春耕前遍撒于地里，随即犁一遍，使粪翻入土内，然后下种。
    ５、种籽处理：用种籽多少，要看地的好坏，ｃｈǒｎｇ＠①土大小，种的迟早来确定。好地一斤，薄地斤半，早种斤半，迟种一斤，种籽要用清水掏掏，漂去秕籽，将沈下的种籽种上，出苗才能齐楚。
    ６、种法：各地方的种法不一样，有的地方用三条腿耧下种，有用两条腿耧下种，据我们数年经验，因它的发杈力强，根茬大，以两条腿耧下种为最好，如此能支开，长的肥而且省工。
    ７、间苗：由于它的发杈力强，苗高二三寸时就要间苗，若间的迟了，容易长荒，留苗距离，要根据地的肥瘦去确定，否则肥地留的稠，瘦地留的稀，就会影响它的生长发育和产量。如用一尺宽的两条腿耧下种的，头等地一尺二寸（市尺），二等地八寸到一尺，三等地六寸到八寸不管用那种耧种，都留单株。
    ８、中耕（锄）：小苗出土后，长到三寸多高，就要开始锄头一遍，有的先间苗后锄地，有的间苗与锄地同时进行，在锄头遍时就开始发杈，只锄破地皮即可。苗根不要围土，围上土就会妨碍他的发杈或发杈很少，而影响产量，等到苗子一尺高，到锄第二遍时，根部稍围些土，就没关系了，三次锄苗要围足土，三锄必须在未抽穗前（二尺高时）进行，方不怕碰伤苗株。
  三、“八一一谷”也须要选种
    谷子虽不容易串种，要是和别的谷子混杂了，成熟期就会差前错后，不好管理，并且还会发生病害，减低产量，所以在谷子完全成熟的时候，就要到地里拣支杈多、杆长粗壮、籽粒饱满的穗子，无论选种多少，在打场的时候，都要注意用没打过谷的场，以免混杂了种籽，传染上病菌。
    现在各处种的“八一一谷”多数混杂不纯了，在选种的时候，要分辨什么是纯种“八一一谷”，必须先了解他的特征，就是在谷码上长的有毛，呈弯曲状。
