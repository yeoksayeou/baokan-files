[Ping City News] The Ping City Fifth Precinct reported the capture of Kuomintang scattered bandits Wang Huiqing, Cui Ruiqing, Liu Jinglian, and three others, stating: At 9:15 PM on the 16th of this month, three bandits went to the home of Chen Shunqing, a cloth merchant at No. 8 Yaotai, within the jurisdiction of the Fifth Precinct, intending to rob him. Because the homeowner resisted, and the neighbors helped by shouting, the bandits, in a state of panic and confusion, fired a shot at the homeowner. They did not steal anything and fled. The Second Sub-station heard the gunshot and immediately used the location as the core to encircle and search. They proceeded to the south entrance of Nanxiawazi, where they saw a person running towards them, appearing flustered and speaking incoherently, with traces of climbing on the shoulders and legs. Upon inspection, they found a scattered soldier registration certificate, silver dollars, and opium on their person. Considering the suspicion to be significant, they took the individual to the sub-station for interrogation. After extensive questioning, the individual confessed to being a bandit. However, he only admitted to acting alone, attempting to exonerate his accomplices. After persuasion and education, he revealed the names and addresses of the other two. Based on this clue, they mobilized overnight and, in less than seven hours, apprehended all the bandits. They also seized two handguns and twenty-five bullets. Subsequently, they also recovered twenty-six pieces of various cloths from the bandits and the homes of those who harbored them, as well as furniture, flour, and other items purchased with the proceeds from the sale of stolen goods.

The three bandits apprehended this time were Liu Jinglian (the first to be captured), Wang Huiqing (also known as Wang Wenpu), and Cui Ruiqing (also known as Cui Rui), all scattered soldiers from the Kuomintang's Thirteenth Army. After interrogation, they confessed to nine robberies. These included one robbery at Dongliushujing, Dongzhushikou, under the jurisdiction of the First Precinct; one robbery at the home of Zhao Yintong at No. 4 Chuandian Hutong; one robbery at the east entrance of Shijia Hutong, under the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct; one robbery at the Taihe Grain Store at No. 98 Yanshou Temple Street; one robbery at the Yiheyong Cloth Store at No. 25 Nanbu Alley; one robbery at the Zhenxing Cloth Store at No. 22 Ganjing Hutong; one robbery each at the Yuanfenghong Cloth Store and the Qingfenghou Cloth Store, both at No. 6, First Alley, East Market, Tianqiao, under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Precinct; and one attempted robbery at the home of Chen Shunqing at No. 8 Yaotai. The items stolen totaled over fifty pieces of various cloths and over 110,000 People's Yuan, in addition to some clothing.

The reasons for the successful resolution of this case are: First, the masses achieved "neighborhood mutual assistance" and were "not afraid of violence." After the bandits entered the courtyard, the neighbors discovered them and collectively shouted and yelled, with some even throwing iron pots from outside the wall to hit the bandits. In addition, the homeowner bravely resisted, forcing the bandits to panic and abandon the robbery, exposing their target and attracting the attention of public security personnel. This is unlike situations elsewhere where robberies occur, and neighbors believe that since the bandits are not robbing them, it is none of their business, and they stand idly by. The homeowners, adopting an attitude of not wanting to cause trouble, simply accept their bad luck. They do not dare to report to the Public Security Bureau when robbed, and even after the bandits leave, they delay reporting or do not report at all, making it impossible to pursue them. Second, on the part of the public security personnel: Because they had been increasing vigilance and strengthening patrols for several days, after learning of the bandit situation, all personnel, whether on or off duty, quickly mobilized and made strict arrangements, using the bandit alarm location as the core for encirclement and search. After capturing one bandit, they were able to seize the opportunity to investigate leads and immediately mobilize based on these leads, thus solving the entire case.

　　要想顺利捕获匪徒  事主院邻都得动手
    平外五分局捕获王惠卿等匪徒经过
　　要想顺利捕获匪徒事主院邻都得动手  平外五分局捕获王惠卿等匪徒经过
    【平市讯】平市外五分局报导捕获国民党散匪王惠卿、崔瑞清、刘景连等三人之经过称：本月十六日晚九时十五分，外五分局界内窑台八号卖布商人陈顺庆家，去了三个匪徒，打算抢劫。因为事主抗拒，院邻帮助呼喊，匪徒于惊慌忙乱之下，向事主打了一枪，未抢走任何物品，即行逃跑。该管第二分驻所听到枪声，即以该处为核心，包围搜索，行至南下洼子南口地方，见对面跑来一人，行色慌张，言语支离，肩头有托足登房足迹，检查身上，发现有散兵登记证、银元、烟土等物，认为嫌疑重大，带至分所讯问。经多方盘讯，方始承认是匪。然仅承认是他一人所为，企图开脱同帮。经说服教育后，才说出其他二人姓名住处。根据这个线索，漏夜出动，不及七小时，将匪全部缉获，并起出手枪两支，子弹二十五粒。其后又自匪人及窝赃人家中起出各种布匹二十六匹，及由变卖赃物购置之家具面粉等物。
    此次所获三匪，一名刘景连（最初捕获者），一名王惠卿（又名王文浦），一名崔瑞清（又名崔瑞），均为国民党十三军散兵。经审讯后，已招认抢过九起。计外一分局东珠市口东柳树井地方劫案一起，川店胡同四号赵荫同家抢案一起，外二分局施家胡同东口劫案一起，延寿寺街九十八号太和粮栈，南布巷子二十五号义合永布庄，及甘井胡同二十二号振兴布庄抢案各一起，外五分局天桥东市场一巷六号源丰恒布店及庆丰厚布店抢案各一起，窑台八号陈顺庆家行抢未遂一起，先后所抢物品，除零星衣服外，各种布匹约五十余匹，人民券约十一万余元。
    此次案件能顺利破获之原因：第一，群众方面做到了“邻里互助”，“不怕强暴”。匪人进院，经院邻发觉后，群起鼓噪呼喊，甚至有自墙外抛进铁壶击匪者。再加事主奋勇抗拒，迫使匪人发慌而放抢，暴露了目标，引起公安人员注意。不象他处发生抢案时，院邻认为匪不抢我，不干我事，袖手不管；事主则抱伤财不惹事态度，自认倒霉算了，被抢时不敢报告公安局，匪走后也迟迟才报，或根本不报，以致无从追缉。第二，在公安人员方面：因数日来提高警觉，加强巡逻，于得知匪警情况后，无论已未出勤人员，均迅速出动，严密布置。以匪警地点为核心，包围搜索。于捕得一匪后，又能抓紧时间，讯究线索，根据线索，立时出动，因而将全案破获。
