Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th – Changchun, after being liberated for half a year, has shaken off the paralyzed state of the Kuomintang rule era and is thriving. Public utilities, severely damaged by Kuomintang bandit troops, have been mostly repaired thanks to the efforts of the workers. Of the original thirty-six power transmission lines, thirty-one have been repaired, restoring more than 16,000 horsepower of dynamic electricity, supplying eight hundred and seventy-nine factories and more than sixty thousand ordinary users. More than one hundred and twenty-seven thousand electric lights have been installed throughout the city, and the main street lights have been repaired. The waterworks have restored three water sources and water purification equipment, delivering more than ten thousand tons of water daily, ensuring water use throughout the city. Sewers that have not been cleaned for three years can now smoothly discharge sewage. Thirty trams have been restored. Two thousand seven hundred telephones have been installed in the city. Telegraph services are open to Northeast China and all parts of Guan Nei (areas south of Shanhaiguan). Twelve postal offices have been restored in the city. After the government invested heavily in municipal enterprises throughout the city, more than twenty factories have started work, and the repaired gas plant can supply more than thirty households. Private industry and commerce, after being assisted by government loans, have also developed from more than two hundred businesses in the early days of liberation to ten thousand six hundred and ninety-two, including five thousand and fifty-seven industrial enterprises, employing more than thirty-three thousand two hundred workers. Since the establishment of state-owned stores, they have supplied the daily necessities of citizens such as grain and fuel, stabilizing prices. With the support of state-owned stores, the number of cooperatives of various types throughout the city has increased to eighty-eight, with a total of more than sixty thousand five hundred members. There are six middle schools and one industrial vocational school above the secondary level, with more than seven thousand students. The number of primary schools has increased from more than twenty before liberation to one hundred and two, with a total of more than forty-one thousand students. There are already twenty workers' night schools, with more than one thousand seven hundred students enrolled.
