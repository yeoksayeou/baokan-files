The "Service to Poland Work Brigade," in a letter to President Bierut, representing 1.2 million outstanding Polish young men and women, resolved to complete their service plan for the first half of the year one month ahead of schedule. They also pledged to contribute 69 million work hours within the year, repairing 600 kilometers of drainage ditches, 3,100 kilometers of roads, digging 1,843 kilometers of canals, planting 30,000 hectares of forest, and constructing 1,608 cultural institutions and schools. The enthusiasm of Polish young men and women in dedicating themselves to national construction is truly inspiring.

In the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, patriotic young men and women have organizations similar to the "Service to Poland Work Brigade." They use their spare time from work and study to build roads in cities, repair canals in villages, construct schoolhouses for children, and build clubs for adults. They do not waste a single moment, utilizing summer and winter vacations, weekends, and daily after-school hours, in an organized and planned manner, coordinating with the nation's overall construction efforts to advance the national economy and strive for the improvement of the material and cultural lives of all the people.

As outstanding representatives of young men and women in China are convening a national congress, reviewing their strength, and preparing to engage in our country's immense construction work, we should remember the exemplary role of this "Service to Poland Work Brigade," giving play to the vanguard role of youth, and adding our strength, our heat, and our light to our bright and happy future!

    波兰青年的榜样
    “为波兰服务工作队”在写给总统贝鲁特的信中，代表一百二十万优秀的波兰男女青年，决心提前一个月完成今年头半年他们的服务计划，还要在今年一年内作六千九百万个工作时，修排水渠六百公里、公路三千一百公里，掘渠一千八百四十三公里，种植森林三万公顷，建筑文化机关及学校一千六百○八座，波兰男女青年这种献身祖国建设的热情，令人十分感动。
    在东欧的新民主主义国家内，爱国的男女青年们都有类似“为波兰服务工作队”的组织，他们利用了工作及学习的余暇，为城市筑路，为乡村修渠，为儿童筑起校舍，为成年人盖起俱乐部，他们不旷废一分一秒，利用寒暑假、星期、每日的课余，有组织地有计划地配合国家全盘的建设，使国家经济上升一步，为全体人民物质文化生活的提高而努力。
    我们中国的男女青年优秀代表正在开全国代表大会，检阅自己力量，准备投入我们国家巨大建设工作之际，我们应该记取这个“为波兰服务工作队”的示范作用，发挥青年的先锋作用，为我们的光明而幸福的前途添上一把力，一分热，一分光！
