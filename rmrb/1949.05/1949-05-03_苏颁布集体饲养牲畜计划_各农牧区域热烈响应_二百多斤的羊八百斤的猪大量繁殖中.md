Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Moscow dispatch: The announcement of the Soviet Union's Council of Ministers and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee regarding the three-year plan for developing collective livestock breeding has sparked enthusiastic responses throughout the Soviet Union. From Ukraine to Siberia, from the Armenian mountains to the Kazakh steppes, numerous collective farms, state-owned farms, and remote pastures, collective farmers, agricultural workers, and herders have held mass meetings to read and discuss the plan, and formulate their own plans. Farmers of the Lenin Collective Farm in Kazakhstan pledged to breed 120 lambs for every 100 sheep this year, and to produce 2,000 liters of milk per cow. The New Road Collective Farm in Ukraine recently completed its plan for delivering livestock products to the state ahead of schedule, delivering more than 21,000 liters of milk, 7,300 kilograms of meat, and more than 2,000 eggs.

Another dispatch: In recent years, Soviet livestock breeding experts, based on the theories of Michurin biology, have crossbred many highly reproductive livestock breeds. A group of breeding experts who have bred new breeds of sheep have been awarded Stalin Prizes. The "Siberian, Ram Yarlett" breed of sheep averages 110 kilograms in weight (1 kilogram equals 2 market jin), and can be sheared 11 to 12 kilograms of wool each time. The wool of these new breeds of sheep is up to 12 centimeters long (1 centimeter equals 3 market fen) and is a fine raw material for making yarn and woolen fabrics. In addition, the breeding experts who bred the new breed of pigs, the "Vlatovskaya" breed, which weighs up to 400 kilograms and has a fat thickness of up to 16 centimeters, have also won awards. Tens of thousands of these pigs have now been bred.
