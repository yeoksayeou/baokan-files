　　This Year's Wheat Can Be Harvested When Fully Ripe
　　An'yang People Comfort Troops and Celebrate Victory
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st] The people of the An'yang region in northern Henan held a grand movement to comfort the troops and celebrate their victory, expressing their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army for eliminating harm for the people and celebrating their own liberation. For many years, the people of the An'yang region had suffered all kinds of ravages from the Kuomintang bandit troops entrenched in An'yang. When the news of the complete annihilation of the An'yang bandit troops on the 6th spread, the people in An'yang city and the surrounding counties were overjoyed. They said, "Now we can live in peace!" "This year's wheat must be harvested when it is fully ripe!" (In previous years, due to the bandit troops seizing grain, farmers harvested the wheat before it was ripe.) When the citizens of Shuiye Town heard of the liberation of An'yang, the whole town immediately resounded with gongs and drums, and meetings were held in various streets to actively prepare to comfort the People's Liberation Army. The vice-chairman of the women workers' union in a certain street convened everyone for a meeting despite being ill, saying, "This is even more relieving than taking a Shunqi pill. Our troops have avenged us, and we must comfort them well." The people in the mountainous areas of Lin County, An'yang, offered a large number of eggs, persimmon cakes, and walnuts and sent them to An'yang to comfort the troops. In recent days, on the several highways around An'yang city, the lines of people comforting the troops have been endless. On the 12th, a victory celebration attended by more than 40,000 people was held in An'yang city. Thousands upon thousands of people from all walks of life came from dozens or even more than a hundred li away to participate. They carried burdens and drove carts, presenting more than 44,000 eggs and many fat pigs, comfort bags, and ten silk banners to the troops who liberated An'yang.

　　今年麦子可等熟透再割了
  　安阳人民劳军祝捷
    【新华社北平二十一日电】豫北安阳地区人民举行盛大的劳军祝捷运动，感谢解放军的为民除害和欢庆自己的解放。安阳地区人民，多年来受尽了盘踞安阳的国民党匪军的百般蹂躏。当六日安阳匪军全部被歼的消息传出时，安阳城乡及附近各县的人民欢欣若狂。他们说：“这一下可以过安静日子了！”“今年的麦子一定要等到熟透了再割！”（往年因匪军抢粮，农民不待麦熟即行收割。）水冶镇市民听到安阳解放时，全镇立刻响起一片锣鼓声，各街纷纷集会，积极筹备慰劳解放军。某街女工会副主席带病召集大家开会，她说：“这真比吃顺气丸还痛快，咱们队伍给咱们报了仇，咱们要好好慰劳他们。”安阳林县山区的人民，献出了大批的鸡蛋、柿饼、核桃，送往安阳劳军。连日来，安阳城周的几条公路上，劳军的行列，络绎不绝。十二日，安阳城内并举行了一个四万多人的祝捷大会。成千上万的各界人民，从数十里甚至百多里外赶来参加，他们挑着担子，赶着大车，将四万四千多个鸡蛋和许多肥猪、慰问袋和十面锦旗献给解放安阳的部队。
