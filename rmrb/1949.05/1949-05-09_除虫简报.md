    Pest Control Briefs
    ▲ In Zhengtang (formerly Xinhe) County, Southern Hebei, pests have broken out in the wheat fields. In twenty villages, including Jia Village and Baohua Village, approximately 2,100 mu of wheat seedlings are infested with spider mites, with severely affected areas having more than 200 mites per seedling. The local area immediately established a pest control committee to organize the eradication efforts. The masses have high confidence and vowed not to damage a single wheat plant. In addition, spider mites and aphids have also been discovered in Nanhe, Longyao, and Jize counties, and are currently being eradicated.
    ▲ Spider mites have been discovered in the wheat fields of Songjiazhuang, Gaoyi, Taihang. The infestation is particularly severe in approximately 80 mu, with some wheat seedlings having more than 1,000 mites. The masses were complacent and somewhat pessimistic. Bad elements even spread rumors, saying, "Spider mites will cost you two shi per mu." After the county discovered this, it immediately sent people to organize the eradication efforts. First, they broke the masses' complacent and self-serving thinking. Men and women, young and old, were all mobilized. After a day of fighting, the heavily infested areas of more than 80 mu were basically cleared. The masses felt the power of collective strength and were in high spirits.
    ▲ In Wen'an County, Hebei Province, spider mites and pill bugs and other pests have broken out on wheat seedlings in many villages. In the four low-lying areas and twelve villages of the Second and Third Districts, 140 qing of wheat seedlings have been affected by pests. The leaves of some wheat seedlings have turned yellow and dried out, and some insects have already laid eggs in the soil under the roots. After the county committee discovered this, it immediately organized its forces. The county committee personally led the team to rush to the disaster area overnight to organize the eradication efforts. This greatly encouraged the masses' confidence in pest control. A forum of experienced farmers was also convened to exchange experiences and introduce pest control methods. It was decided to widely publicize and organize the masses to eradicate the pests.
    ▲ In the Zoushanling area of the Ninth District of Huolu, more than 80 mu of wheat have been found with armyworms. District Chief Cao Wenrui personally led the masses to capture and kill the pests, paying special attention to absorbing women and children. Everyone's enthusiasm for pest control is very high.
