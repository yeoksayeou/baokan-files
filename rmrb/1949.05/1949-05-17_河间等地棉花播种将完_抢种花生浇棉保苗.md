[Jizhong Electric] The cotton planting tasks in Qingyuan and Hejian have been basically completed. The current focus is on a concentrated effort to plant peanuts, combined with a campaign to replant seedlings and protect them. In seven villages in the first district of Qingyuan, as of May 9th, over 1,600 mu of peanuts have been planted, accounting for 72% of the original allocation of 2,920 mu. In the third district of Hejian, 2,000 mu of peanuts were allocated for planting, and 1,100 mu have been sown, accounting for 55%. The masses in both counties are actively rushing to plant peanuts. In Nanmatan, Hejian, due to the scarcity of wells, the entire village is using them in shifts, "resting people but not the wells." Some are carrying water at night to water the pits, and then sowing the seeds in the morning.

Recently, due to the prolonged drought, some cotton seedlings in some areas have been dried up. Various places have proposed irrigating the cotton to protect the seedlings. Five districts in Hejian have begun irrigating the cotton. According to statistics on the 12th, 292 households in 16 villages in the five districts have irrigated 527 mu of cotton. However, because there were some cloudy days the day before, the peanut planting season is not considered late, and the masses have developed the idea of waiting for rain, intending to delay action. After discovering this, the county party committee pointed out that the arduous task of planting peanuts should be completed in one go, without any slackening. They emphasized that party branch members should take the lead in mobilizing and organizing the masses to continue digging wells and sowing seeds. The Qingyuan County Party Committee also convened a joint meeting of district chiefs and district party committees in a timely manner to study the planting of peanuts and the launch of a campaign to replant and protect seedlings.

[Jinan Electric] Resolutely fight drought and implement the plan to plant 210,000 mu of peanuts. Cadres and the masses in Yuancheng are urgently mobilized to launch the masses to dig wells and sow seeds. After ten days of concentrated effort, sorghum and millet have been rushed to plant. Cotton, melons, etc. will also be finished soon, but the planting season for peanuts is urgent, and the weather is still arid and without rain. In order to ensure the timely completion of this huge plan, the county party committee proposed to oppose complacency and wavering thoughts about completing the plan. The working masses recalled the experience of fighting drought in the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), organized forces to dig wells and sow seeds. The cadres and masses in the seventh district wavered due to specific difficulties. For example, out of 40 households in Dawangzhai Village, eight households wanted to change their original plans due to the famine, and some sold their seeds to buy food to survive the famine. The Party and government leaders in the district educated the masses to strengthen their determination to complete the plan. For example, Wang Daoke, a cadre in Huazhuang, said: "I used to emphasize that the soil in our village was not good and we could not dig wells, but now I know that it is shameful for living people to bow to difficulties." All the cadres in the district unanimously expressed their determination to dig 580 wells and complete the peanut planting plan. Currently, the farmers in various villages are rushing to dig wells and sow seeds. Dongsongzhuang planted 70 mu in three days. The farmers in the county have full confidence in ensuring that peanuts are sown according to plan.

[Jidong Electric] The Jidong Administrative Office has recently issued instructions to the governments of various special districts and counties to actively complete the peanut sowing work: (1) The cotton planting work teams (groups) in various places should immediately shift to helping the masses plant peanuts. First, they must check the loan situation of seeds, and those who have not been loaned should be loaned out day and night; secondly, they should strengthen publicity work to dispel the doubts of the masses. (2) In the sowing of peanuts, it is necessary to establish the positive idea that man will conquer nature, publicize and absorb the successful experiences of drought prevention, well digging, and water carrying for sowing in various places, and give play to the creativity and wisdom of the masses, and appropriately solve the difficulties of human and animal labor. (3) In the work of increasing peanut planting, attention should be paid to preventing coercion and command, but also to correcting the idea of overly accommodating the self-sufficiency of small-scale peasant producers.

　　河间等地棉花播种将完
  　抢种花生浇棉保苗
    【冀中电】清苑、河间种棉任务已基本上完成，目前主要是突击点种花生，结合开展补苗保苗运动。清苑一区七个村，截至五月九号止，已点种花生一千六百余亩，占原分配二千九百二十亩的百分之七十二。河间三区分配种花生二千亩，已播种一千一百亩，占百分之五十五。两个县的群众都正积极突击点种花生。河间南马滩因为井少，全村轮流使用，“歇人不歇井”。有的晚上担水浇坑，早晨再点种籽。
    又近来由于久旱不雨，有的地区棉苗已被干死，各地又提出保苗浇棉，河间已有五个区开始浇棉，到十二日统计，五个区十六个村二百九十二户，即浇棉五百二十七亩。但因前天有些阴云，种花生季节尚不算晚，群众又发生等雨思想，企图缓缓动手，该县委发现后指出：对种花生的艰巨任务，要一气哈成，不要稍有松懈，强调支部党员带头，发动组织群众，继续挖井点种。清苑县委也及时的召开区长区委联席会，研究点种花生和开展补苗保苗运动。
    【冀南电】坚决抗旱，贯彻完成种植花生二十一万亩计划，元朝干部群众紧急动员，发动群众挖井点种。该县播种经十天突击，高粱、谷子已抢种完毕。棉花、瓜等亦将点种完，但种植花生节令已紧迫，天仍亢旱不雨，县委为保证按时完成此巨大计划，提出反对松口气，和对完成计划的动摇思想，劳动群众回忆民国三十二年抗旱的经验，组织力量进行挖井点种。七区干部群众因有具体困难思想动摇，如大王寨村四十户中，因灾荒就有八户想变更原来计划，有的把种子卖掉买成粮食渡荒、该区党、政领导上教育群众坚定完成计划的决心，如化庄干部王道科说：“以前我强调俺村土不好，不能挖井，现在知道了活人向困难低头是可耻的。”全区干部一致表示坚决挖井五百八十眼，完成种植花生计划。现各村农民正在突击挖井点种，东宋庄三天即点种七十亩，全县农民具有十分信心，保证花生按计划下种。
    【冀东电】冀东行政公署顷对各专、县政府发出积极完成花生播种工作的指示；（一）各地植棉工作队（组）立即转入帮助群众种植花生工作，首先要检查贷种的情况，未贷的要星夜贷放下去；其次是加强宣传工作，以解除群众的疑虑。（二）在播种花生中，要树立人定胜天的积极思想，宣传和吸取各地防旱挖井担水点种的成功经验，发挥群众的创造和智慧，适当解决人畜劳力的困难。（三）在增植花生工作中，注意防止强迫命令，但也要注意纠正过分迁就农民小生产者自给自足的思想。
