    Strictly Guard Against Hidden Enemies

    With the liberation of all of North China, a new era of transition from war to construction has begun. To ensure the smooth restoration and development of production for all our people, and to safeguard the people's safety and freedom, we must strengthen social security work, eradicate all bandits and special agents, and strictly guard against all hidden enemies.

    As the victory of the North China Liberation War concludes, a sense of complacency and paralysis may very likely grow among some cadres and the masses, who might think that since the open armed enemies have been eliminated, they can rest easy from now on, neglecting the enemies in the dark. The people's armed work in some old liberated areas has begun to slack off. In the militia, there is also the idea of "laying down arms and living a good life." In some newly liberated areas, because the masses have not been earnestly mobilized for bandit prevention and self-defense, scattered bandits and spies still harm the people from time to time, and some hidden saboteurs who have been lurking are still making trouble. Recently, arson incidents by special agents have occurred in both Tianjin and Beiping. In Beiping, the tram company lost fifty-eight trams in one incident, a loss equivalent to about four months of Beiping's tax revenue. Similarly, in the countryside, special agents in some areas are also using secret societies to sabotage spring plowing, spreading various superstitious rumors, and disintegrating the productive enthusiasm of the masses. All this should arouse our high vigilance and be effectively dealt with, and we must never allow it to spread.

    To this end, we must first overcome complacency and actively lead the people to strengthen security and defense work. All sabotage incidents must also be examined politically and economically to study the reasons for their occurrence, and then dealt with separately. For those who were forced to take risks under the rule of the Kuomintang due to the hardships of life and have not yet been able to shift to production, we should strive to bring them back to the production front and give them proper resettlement. As long as their economic difficulties are resolved, they will consciously rehabilitate themselves. Another small number of people are those with ulterior political motives. They organize secret societies, fabricate party names (such as the China New Social Revolution Party uncovered in Beiping), develop hidden armed forces, and carry out organized and planned evil deeds such as sabotage, assassination, and spreading rumors. The ringleaders among them, who are guilty of the most heinous crimes, must be severely punished and resolutely suppressed. All secret societies and reactionary political organizations must be banned, their crimes must be exposed among the masses, and we must win over those who were coerced into joining them.

    The most basic task is to mobilize the masses to carry out security and defense work. In urban production departments, we must rely on the working class to organize pickets and security and defense committees to extensively report bad people (recently, the Beiping Post Office has identified twenty-six special agents), and improve the work of the Public Security Bureau. In rural areas, we should rely on farmers' associations and militias to strengthen the people's armed work. Those that have slackened should be reorganized, and those that have not yet been established should be established as soon as possible by relying on the people. We must defeat the sabotage activities of secret societies by actively promoting people's production and strengthening hygiene work. Wherever bandit and special agent activities are discovered, we should rely on the people to vigorously suppress bandits; otherwise, production cannot proceed. Bandit suppression is not a purely military issue; we should find out the causes politically and economically, treat them differently, and establish social security order step by step.

    严防隐蔽的敌人
    华北全境解放，从战争转向建设的新时代开始了。为了保障我全体人民顺利地恢复与发展生产，保障人民的安全与自由，必须加强社会治安工作，肃清一切匪特，严防一切隐蔽的敌人。
    由于华北解放战争的胜利结束，在某些干部和群众中极可能滋长着太平麻痹观念，以为公开的武装敌人既已肃清，今后便可高枕无忧了，忽视了暗中的敌人。有些老解放区的人民武装工作开始松弛下来。民兵中也发现有“放下武器，过好日子”的思想。部分新解放地区，由于没有认真发动群众防匪自卫，以致仍时有散匪奸特危害人民，一些潜伏下的有组织的暗藏破坏分子还在捣乱。平津两地最近都发生了特务放火事件，北平电车公司一次即烧掉了五十八辆电车，损失了约等于北平四个月税收的总额。同样在农村中，部分地区特务也在利用会门破坏春耕，散布各种迷信谣言，瓦解群众生产情绪。这一切，应引起我们高度警惕，并有效地加以处理，绝不允其有所蔓延。
    为此，我们首先必须克服麻痹观念，积极领导人民加强保卫治安工作，对一切破坏事件还须从政治上经济上加以检查，研究其发生的原因，然后分别加以处理。对于那些在国民党统治下被生活所迫挺而走险现在一时尚未能转入生产的人，应争取他们回到生产战线，给他们以妥善安置。只要从经济上解决了他们的困难，他们便会自觉重新作人。另一小部分人则是政治上别有企图的分子，他们组织会门，巧立党派名目（如北平破获的中国新社会革命党），发展隐蔽武装，有组织有计划地进行破坏暗杀造谣等罪恶勾当，对其中为首的罪大恶极分子必须予以严惩，坚决镇压，取缔一切会门及反动政治组织，在群众中揭发他们的罪恶，争取胁从分子。
    最基本的工作是发动群众进行治安保卫工作，在城市生产部门中，要依靠工人阶级组织纠察队及治安保卫委员会，广泛地检举坏人（最近北平邮政局已检查出二十六名特务分子），健全公安局工作，在农村应依靠农会、民兵，加强人民武装工作，已经松懈了的应重新整顿，未建立的，应依靠人民从速建立，我们要从积极推动人民生产，加强卫生工作等等方面来击破会门破坏活动，凡是发现匪特活动的地方，均应依靠人民大力肃匪，否则生产也无法进行。肃匪不是单纯的军事问题，应当从政治上经济上找出原因，区别对待，有步骤地建立社会治安秩序。
