    Still Need to Prepare for a Long and Resolute Struggle - Written for the 30th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement

    The "May Fourth" Movement was a movement of thought, as well as a mass movement. Of course, it was also a political movement. From the ideological point of view, the main trend at that time was anti-feudalism (anti-li jiao – Confucianism and its rites), advocating individual liberation. As a mass movement that surged across the country after its outbreak, the main force at that time had to be the petty-bourgeois intellectuals – young students. As for the political slogans of the "May Fourth" Movement, as is well known, they were anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and the liberation of the oppressed classes, although this last one was not very clear at the time.

    The leading figures of the "May Fourth" Movement were mainly divided into two factions in terms of ideological differences. One faction was the Marxists. Mr. Li Dazhao, who was commemorated a few days ago on the 22nd anniversary of his martyrdom, was an outstanding representative. The other faction can be勉强 said to be bourgeois liberals (at that time, they still maintained the appearance of liberals). Hu Shih, a war criminal who has now degenerated into a boring and shameless American-Chiang Kai-shek running dog, is a most typical representative. At that time, the momentum and mass base of bourgeois liberal thought surpassed Marxism. This is an undeniable fact. However, over the past thirty years, it has not been bourgeois liberalism, but the working class's Marxism-Leninism that has enriched the ideological content of the "May Fourth" Movement and strengthened its combat effectiveness. Over the past thirty years, it has not been the bourgeois liberals, but the vanguard of the working class, the Marxist-Leninist party, that has pointed out the historical direction of national liberation and resolutely and correctly led the people forward during every period of national crisis. This year is the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. In this "Red May," old China, which was semi-feudal and semi-colonial, has come to an end, and a new China that has shocked the world has been born. The historical task of the "May Fourth" Movement has finally been completed. Isn't this ironclad fact enough to prove which is the truth, which is flourishing, and which is violating the laws of history and destined to decline?

    The Chinese national bourgeoisie once expressed excitement and the desire to reinvigorate itself in the early days of the "May Fourth" Movement. However, the Chinese national bourgeoisie, which was inherently weak, was both compromising towards imperialism and terrified of the liberation demands of the working people. Therefore, after a period of excitement, under the threat of enticement by reactionary forces at home and abroad, it immediately turned right-leaning, and even reactionary. A part of it finally fell into the arms of the feudal landlord-comprador class and relied on imperialism. The manifestation of this in the cultural field is the vacillation of the liberals and the eventual degeneration of some of them. There are too many such examples to repeat. If, in the early days of the "May Fourth" Movement, when the liberals had not yet put away the banner of anti-feudalism and at least did not dare to openly defend imperialism, the young petty-bourgeois intellectuals still had illusions about liberalism, then at this time, either they felt disillusioned and depressed, or they resolutely went to the banner of Marxism. This is also what we have seen with our own eyes or experienced personally, so there is no need to give more examples. During this period, Marxism-Leninism was still in the process of development in China. The Chinese revolutionary movement made mistakes and suffered setbacks. The depressed young intellectuals experienced a short period of ideological confusion. Petty-bourgeois youths used decadence as a refuge, drinking and pounding the table with their girlfriends in small rooms, hysterically shouting: "Go to the people! Go to the people!" The bankrupt children of families, intoxicated by individual anarchism, wearing faded colorful clothes, squandered the last dowry and private savings of their wives, "passionately" and indignantly shouting: "Everything will be destroyed! After everything is destroyed, Utopia will appear!" Metaphysical ghosts, sleepwalkers, "art-for-art's-sake" advocates hiding in the ivory towers on street corners, futurists, fin-de-siècle melancholy sufferers, revivalists, proponents of complete Westernization, etc., all appeared on the stage at the same time. However, all this ideological confusion was finally gradually clarified under the light of Marxism-Leninism: isn't this also what everyone has experienced, as if it only happened yesterday?

    From Darwinism to Marxism, from Ibsen to Gorky, from "experimentalism" to dialectics, from critical realism to socialist realism, from unconditionally staging modern European literary and artistic forms to proposing the topic of national forms – over the past thirty years, this road has been circuitous and tortuous, but it has not been cyclical but has been advancing step by step, making struggles on two fronts at every step. Today, "thirty years as one generation," the Sinicization of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, just as it has achieved great victories in the political and military fields, has also achieved decisive victories on the cultural front.

    However, we cannot say that the enemies of the new democratic culture under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought have all surrendered and been completely eliminated. The enemies of the new democratic culture include imperialist culture, feudal culture, and comprador culture. On this 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, Shanghai, the largest cultural center in southern China, may have been liberated, or at least is on the eve of liberation. For thirty years, Shanghai has stood at the forefront of the cultural front, where the struggle has been the most intense, and Shanghai has always been a "co-existence and co-prosperity circle" of imperialist culture, feudal culture, and comprador culture. Its stubbornness may be the highest in the country. The liberation of Shanghai does not mean the elimination of these three reactionary cultures, just as after the victory of the revolution throughout the country, we cannot say that reactionary forces will disappear. The remnants of imperialist culture, feudal culture, and comprador culture are still lurking everywhere in the country, and we still have to wage a long and arduous struggle.

    Our opposition to imperialist culture does not mean that we reject all constructive academic thoughts, classical literature and art, and critical realist literature and art of imperialist countries. What we oppose and must eliminate in our cultural and ideological fields are the things that act as vanguards of imperialist aggression and play a corrupting and paralyzing role in the spirit of the Chinese people, such as the individualism and decadent ideas of the declining period of the European and American bourgeoisie, all so-called "modernist" in literature and art, especially what is sold under the signboard of "Americanism," such as American-style democracy, the American-style free way of life, and the philistine literature and art and philistine philosophy of the American style. Chiang Kai-shek, this transportation chief, sent American equipment, and the People's Liberation Army has happily accepted it, but the "Americanism" branded goods that came with or before the American equipment, no matter how beautifully decorated, must be thoroughly eliminated by the warriors on our cultural front and sent back to the original owner. We do not need "Americanism" democracy and a "free way of life," nor do we need philistine philosophy and pornographic literature and art that flaunt thighs and breasts.

    Similarly, when we say that we must resolutely eliminate feudal culture, it does not mean that we should indiscriminately shelve all our national culture. On the contrary, we must inherit and develop the excellent heritage of our national culture. This level of reasoning has now become almost common sense, and there is no need to explain it further here. The tendrils of feudal culture can be said to be everywhere, entangled in our daily lives; cutting off these tendrils may be more difficult than land reform, and the time required may be even longer.

    Comprador culture can be said to be the godson of imperialist culture, extending its tentacles based on large cities. The petty-bourgeois stratum is the most fertile breeding ground for comprador culture. Worshipping foreigners, indulging in European and American life, "the moon is brighter abroad," in short, spreading national inferiority complex among the people, is the specialty of comprador culture. Especially bad is that it specializes in picking out some feudal decadent customs of China, writing them into books in the posture of peddling fake antiques, earning a few rewards in addition to winning a smile from foreign masters, in order to satisfy their material desires. Lin Yutang is a typical example of this type of comprador culture manufacturer. The Chinese people are great and heroic. Countless moving meritorious deeds emerged in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation. In the whole world, only the people of the Soviet Union have also demonstrated it in the Patriotic War. We must sing the praises of the people's heroic martyrs, promote national self-esteem, and eliminate comprador culture and the comprador class together on the Chinese land!

    The victory of the revolution throughout the country is just around the corner. However, just as sweeping away the remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and the comprador bourgeoisie throughout the country still requires our continued efforts, the time and effort required to sweep away imperialist culture, feudal culture, and comprador culture throughout the country may be even greater? I believe that we can eliminate these three-in-one enemies of the new democratic culture! Because our cultural team has thirty years of struggle experience, we are no longer like the "May Fourth" Movement thirty years ago, which lacked experience and had an unorganized camp; now we not only know how to defeat the enemy, but also know how to unite friendly forces. But in order to guarantee success, we must continue to study, transform ourselves better, and arm our minds with the most advanced ideas of mankind. (April 30)

    还须准备长期而坚决的斗争  为“五四”三十周年纪念作
    “五四”运动是思想运动，也是群众运动。当然又是政治运动。从思想方面看，那时成为主潮的，是反封建（反礼教），主张个性解放。而作为一个既发之后即澎薄全国的群众运动，那时的主力不能不说是小资产阶级知识分子——青年学生。至于“五四”的政治口号，如所周知，就是反帝反封建和解放被压迫阶级，虽然这最后一个在当时还不大明确。
    “五四”运动的领导人物在思想分野上，主要也分为两派。一派是马克斯主义者，几天以前纪念过的二十二年前殉难的李守常先生就是一个卓越的代表。又一派，勉强可说是资产阶级自由主义者（在当时，他们还保持了自由主义者的面目）。现在已经堕落到无聊而又无耻的美蒋走狗，战犯胡适，便是一个最为典型的代表。在那时候，资产阶级自由主义的思想，其声势，其群众，都胜过马克思主义，这是一个毋庸讳言的事实。然而，三十年来，在思想运动方面，充实了“五四”的思想内容，加强其战斗性的，不是资产阶级的自由主义，而是工人阶级的马列主义；三十年来，在每一民族危机时期，指示了民族解放的历史方向，坚决而正确地领导人民前进的，也不是资产阶级的自由主义者而是工人阶级的先锋队马列主义的政党。今年是“五四”的三十周年，在这“红五月”，半封建半殖民地的旧中国从此结束，震撼了全世界的一个新中国已经产生，“五四”的历史任务也终于完成了，难道这样铁一般的事实还不够证明何者是真理所在，方兴未艾，而何者则是违背历史法则，命定要没落的么？
    中国的民族资产阶级在“五四”初期曾一度表示其兴奋而思振作。然而先天不足的中国民族资产阶级对帝国主义既富于妥协性，对劳苦大众的要求解放则又畏如蛇蝎，于是在一度兴奋以后，在国内外反动势力的威胁利诱下，立即就右倾了，乃至反动了，其中一部分终于倒入封建地主买办阶级的怀抱，投靠在帝国主义的门下。此在文化方面的表现，就是自由主义者的摇摆不定与其中一部分人的终于堕落。这样的例子太多了，不必再学。如果在“五四”初期，当自由主义者还没收起反封建的旗帜而且至少也还不敢公然为帝国主义辩护的时候，小资产阶级的青年知识分子对于自由主义尚存幻想，那么，在这时候，他们若不是感到了幻灭而苦闷，那就毅然走到马克思主义的旗帜下面来了。这也是我们亲眼看见或亲身所经历的，也不必再举例子罢。这一时期，马列主义在中国，尚在发展的过程中。中国革命运动犯过错误，有过挫折。苦闷的知识青年群有过短时期的思想混乱。小资产阶级青年以颓废为逋逃薮，在亭子间里和女朋友一面拼酒，一面举拳击桌，歇斯底里地喊着：“到民间去！到民间去！”为个人无政府主义所陶醉的破落户子弟，穿着褪色的彩衣，挥霍完了他太太的最后一文陪嫁和私蓄，“热情”而愤激地大呼：“一切都毁灭了罢！一切都毁灭了以后，乌托邦就出现了！”玄学鬼，夜游病患者，躲在十字街头的象牙塔内的“艺术至上主义者”，未来派，世纪末的忧悒病，复古派，全盘欧化论，等等，一齐同时登场。然而所有这一切的思想混乱，在马列主义的光耀之下，终于逐渐获得澄清：这不也是大家都经历过，好象仅是昨天发生的事么？
    从达尔文主义到马克思主义，从易卜生到高尔基，从“实验主义”到辩证法，从批判的现实主义到社会主义的现实主义，从无条件地搬演欧洲近代的文艺形式到提出民族形式这一课题——三十年来，这道路是迂回曲折的，但却不是循环往复而是步步前进，步步在作两条战线的斗争。到今天，“三十年为一世”，马列主义的中国化，毛泽东思想，正如已在政治军事上取得伟大的胜利一样，在文化战线上也已得到了决定性的胜利了。
    然而我们还不能说，毛泽东思想领导下的新民主主义文化的敌人已经全部缴械，全部肃清。新民主主义文化的敌人有帝国主义文化，有封建文化，还有买办文化。在“五四”三十周年这一天，南中国的最大文化中心，上海，或许已经解放，至少亦已临到解放的前夜，三十年来，上海是立于文化战线的前哨地位，斗争最为激烈的，而上海一向又是帝国主义文化、封建文化、买办文化的“共存共荣圈”，其顽强性恐为全国冠，上海的解放并不意味着这三种反动文化的消灭，正如革命在全国胜利以后，我们还不能说反动势力就此即将销声匿迹。帝国主义文化，封建文化，和买办文化的余孽在全国各处都还潜伏着，我们还须作长期而艰苦的斗争。
    我们反对帝国主义文化，并不是说我们连帝国主义各国的具有建设性的学术思想，古典文艺以及批判的现实主义的文艺都一概排斥了。我们所反对而必须在我们的文化思想领域中扫除掉的，乃是作为帝国主义侵略先遣队而在中国人民精神上起腐蚀作用与麻痹作用的东西，如欧美资产阶级末落期的个人主义，颓废思想，文艺上的一切所谓“近代派”，特别是在“美国主义”这块招牌下面所倾销的什么美国式的民主，美国式的自由生活方式以及美国作风的市侩文艺，市侩哲学。蒋介石这个运输大队长把美式装备送来，解放军已经笑纳了，但是和美式装备同来或先来的布满了全中国的“美国主义”商标的东西，不论它装璜得怎样美丽，我们文化战线上的战士们却一定要把它彻底扫除，送还原主。我们不需要“美国主义”的民主和“自由生活方式”，也不需要市侩哲学和炫耀大腿乳峰的色情文艺。
    同样地，我们说要坚决消灭封建文化，并不就是说要把我们的民族文化不加辨别地统统束之高阁。相反的，我们民族的优秀文化的遗产我们要继承，还要发展它。这一层道理，现在差不多已成为常识，这里不必再多加以说明了。封建文化的藤蔓可说是到处全是，纠缠在我们的日常生活中；斩除这些藤蔓，恐怕要比土地改革还要费力，需要的时间恐怕也还要多些。
    买办文化可以说是帝国主义文化的干儿子，依大城市为据点而伸长其触角。小资产阶层是买办文化最易蔓生的温床。崇拜洋人，醉心欧美生活，“月亮也是外国的亮些”，一一总而言之一句话，在人民中间散播民族自卑心理，就是买办文化的特长。尤其恶劣的，是专拣中国的一些封建性的颓风敝俗，用贩买假古董的姿态，写成书本子，在博得洋主子一笑之余，赚几个赏钱，以自满足其物质欲。林语堂就是这一类买办文化制造者的典型的例子。中国人民是伟大而英勇的。八年抗日战争三年解放战争中涌现了无数可歌可泣的勋功伟烈，在全世界上现在还唯有苏联的人民也在卫国战争中一样地表现过。我们要歌颂人民的英烈，发扬民族自尊心，把买办文化和买办阶级一齐在中国大地上消灭掉！
    革命在全国胜利已是计日可待的了。然而正象在全国范围内扫清帝国主义、封建主义和买办资产阶级的余孽尚需要我们继续努力一样，在全国范围内扫除帝国主义文化、封建文化和买办文化所需要的时间和努力，也许还要多些罢？我相信我们是能够把这三位一体的新民主主义文化的敌人扫除掉的！因为我们这支文化队伍是有三十年的斗争经验的，我们已不象三十年前的“五四”那时既然缺少经验，而且阵营不整；现在我们不但知道怎样战胜敌人，也知道怎样团结友军。但是为要保证成功，我们必须继续学习，把自己改造得更好些，用人类最进步的思想来武装我们的头脑。  （四月三十日）
