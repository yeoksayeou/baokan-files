    Benzene hexachloride (commonly known as 666)
    Benzene hexachloride is a new comprehensive organic compound insecticide invented after DDT. It has three effects: stomach poison, contact kill, and fumigation. Its effective insecticidal ingredient is "Gammexane," abbreviated as G.I. Therefore, the insecticidal power of 666 is usually determined by the G.I. content. This medicine is better than arsenic for controlling mole crickets: (1) Stronger medicinal power; (2) Cheaper price, each mu of land uses two to four liang of medicine, which is only equivalent to one jin of millet (that is, one jin of millet can control one mu of mole crickets); (3) Arsenic is harmful to the soil, while 666 is harmless.
    Properties: Gammexane is a colorless crystalline substance, insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents. It is chemically stable and does not react to light, heat, and acid, but it decomposes when it encounters alkaline substances. The mixture of its various isomers is a brown powder, bitter in taste, with a strong sour and musty smell. It has a strong insecticidal power. Once contacted or ingested, it can kill insects and there is no chance of revival. It also has a lasting residual toxicity. The speed of toxicity is greater than DDT.
    Application methods: 666 has considerable toxicity to various crop pests. In general, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera insects can be used for prevention and control. The prevention and control methods for important pests are described as follows:
    ① Controlling locusts:
    A. Poison bait: Wheat bran one part (one jin), water ten parts (ten jin).
    Dosage: Each jin of wheat bran contains one gram of 666 with 0.3% G.I. (add a little sugar or vegetable oil to increase attractiveness). This method is more effective for locust swarms under the fourth instar.
    Usage: Sprinkle on crops or grass in the locust area from early morning to noon. The amount used per mu varies depending on the terrain, number of locusts, and instar. Usually, two to six jin of bait are used per mu.
    B. Powder: The 666 used for locust control should contain 0.1% to 0.5% G.I. The amount applied varies depending on the plant environment in the locust area and the number and instar of the locust swarm. For controlling early instar nymphs, use four jin per mu of powder containing 0.3% (G.I.). For fourth to fifth instar or flying locusts, apply two to four jin of 666 containing 0.5% G.I.
    This medicine can be sprayed directly on plants or grass, or spray the medicine in an area to drive the locust nymphs to the application site. When locusts climb onto plants with attached medicinal powder, they will surely die.
    ② Controlling mole crickets:
    A. Poison bait: Wheat bran one part, water one part.
    Dosage: Mix three grams of 666 with 0.3% G.I. in each jin of wet bran, and add raw oil or crude sugar water. Use two to four jin per mu. Sprinkle on the soil surface where mole crickets are found to harm plants before dusk. After one to three days, some dead or semi-dead mole crickets will be found lying on the soil surface in the field (some can return to the soil and die in the soil). The effect is more significant when applied after irrigation or rain.
    B. Poisonous grains: Cook the millet, take it out and let it dry slightly, and mix the medicine into it so that the amount contains 0.3% G.I. 666. When using 666 with a high concentration, you can mix in a considerable amount of soybean flour to make it easy to adhere. Then mix the medicine with the cooked millet and sow it during sowing. About four to eight jin of poisonous grains are used per mu, depending on the degree of mole cricket damage. The purpose of this method is to kill mole crickets and protect ungerminated seeds from being eaten by mole crickets in the soil.
    ③ Preventing and controlling rice grasshoppers and rice leaf rollers: Powder or liquid should use 666 containing 0.3% G.I. Spray on rice leaves in the morning, using three to six jin per mu.
    ④ Controlling flea beetles, cabbage white butterflies, diamondback moths, or yellow flea beetles ＠ (cabbage flea beetles) of cruciferous plants: For larvae or adults that harm cabbage, you can use 666 powder containing 0.2% G.I. to sprinkle on the damaged leaves in the early morning (diamondback moths should be sprinkled on the cabbage heart), using two to four jin per mu, depending on the size of the crop.
    ⑤ Controlling the green leafhopper: You can use 666 powder or liquid containing 0.2% G.I. to sprinkle on the damaged crops, using two to eight jin per mu, depending on the size of the crop.
    ⑥ Controlling cutworms: Poison bait mixing amount (refer to locust control). Sprinkle near the damaged crops before dusk.
    ⑦ Controlling armyworms (prodenia): Use 666 powder or liquid containing 0.3% G.I. to sprinkle or spray on the damaged crops, using three to eight jin per mu, depending on the size of the crop.
    In addition, it has special effects on aphids, Lepidoptera larvae, Coleoptera beetles, weevils, wireworms, leaf beetles, as well as flies, fleas, bugs, and warehouse pests.
    Points to note when using:
    ① 666 powder or liquid cannot be mixed with lime water, lime, or alkali.
    ② 666 will cause phytotoxicity to melon crops, so it cannot be applied to melon crops.
    ③ 666 can be used in combination with DDT, sulfur powder, or calcium arsenate.
    DDT (D.D.T.)
    Properties: DDT is a synthetic chlorinated organic compound with both stomach poison and contact killing effects. Its characteristic is not to quickly kill pests, but to have lasting toxicity, which is unmatched by general insecticides. Except that DDT cannot be mixed with lime sulfur solution or alkali and soap, it can be mixed with various insecticides and fungicides.
    Controlling crop pests: It is very effective for controlling some crop pests. Usually, a sprayer can be used to apply DDT directly to crops. The agent should be evenly distributed. It is not necessary to spray it directly on the insect body. It will take effect when sprayed on the leaves and stems of the damaged crops. Use about ten liang per mu.
    (1) Chewing mouthparts pests: It is very effective for pear weevil, jujube weevil larvae, flea beetles, green worms, cabbage flea beetles, rice leaf rollers, etc. Use a powder sprayer to sprinkle 3% DDT powder on the crops when the morning dew is not dry. The powder should be sprayed evenly. The usual dosage is three to five jin per mu. If water-wettable DDT or DDT emulsion is placed directly in the water, it can be applied. Usually, the dosage is four to eight jin per mu, depending on the size of the crop, planting density, and insect density.
    (2) Sucking mouthparts pests: It is also effective for aphids, cabbage stink bugs, and leafhoppers of various vegetables and fruit trees. At the same time, aphids and leafhoppers can transmit toxins from diseased plants to healthy plants. These insects can be controlled with 3% DDT powder, using three to five jin of medicine per mu. If water-wettable DDT or DDT emulsion is used, use a liquid with a concentration of 1% to 2%, and the amount of medicine needed per mu is four to eight jin.
    (3) Mole crickets: Pour a 2% DDT solution (made by adding water to water-wettable DDT) on the soil surface of seedbeds or nurseries where mole crickets are found to be harmful. Use about four liang of medicine per square foot without causing phytotoxicity. This method is very effective for tobacco seedbeds.
    But the following should be noted for this medicine:
    (1) DDT is poisonous and cannot be ingested.
    (2) DDT solution may seep into the skin and should not be in contact with the skin too much.
    (3) DDT cannot be mixed with lime sulfur solution or alkali, so as not to lose its toxicity.
    (4) DDT is not suitable for controlling melon pests because it can hinder the growth of melons.
    (5) Vegetables that have been treated with DDT should be carefully washed to avoid poisoning. Because DDT has lasting toxicity, vegetable and fruit scraps should not be fed to livestock.
    Tree of Heaven Bark
    The roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of the Tree of Heaven bark have insecticidal effects. The root bark of perennial trees is the best, followed by the stems and leaves, and then the flowers and fruits.
    There are two types of homemade preparations: powder and liquid - (1) Powder: Dry the leaves or root bark in the sun, put them in a pot and stir-fry over low heat until a stimulating and strange odor is emitted, then take them out and mash them into powder. Method of use: take advantage of the morning dew before it dries, and use a sieve or coarse cloth bag to sprinkle the powder on the cabbage leaves to treat adult and larval flea beetles.
    (2) One to two jin of Tree of Heaven root bark, add three to six jin of water to soak and boil it into the stock solution, and dilute it with water at a ratio of four liang of salt per jin of bark and thirty to forty jin of water. Spray it on vegetable leaves with a sprayer, which is very effective in treating flea beetles.
    Lead Arsenate
    Stomach poison, can be used for leaf rollers, vegetable green worms, cotton bridge worms, and leaf-eating pests on fruit trees. It is especially more effective for Lepidoptera larvae than calcium arsenate.
    Application method: There are two types, liquid and powder, which can be used at will. They are described as follows:
    (A) Liquid method: According to the ratio of one to two parts (by weight) of lead arsenate to two hundred parts of water, put the lead arsenate into a fine cloth bag, then put it into the measured water, rub it slowly by hand, and after the lead arsenate is completely rubbed out, stir it with a stick to evenly distribute the lead arsenate in the water, and then spray it. Stir at any time during spraying to avoid powder precipitation.
    (B) Powder method: Mix one jin of lead arsenate with one to two jin of fine carbon powder that has been sieved and mixed evenly, place it in a powder sprayer, and sprinkle it on the damaged crops in the early morning when the dew is not dry.
    (C) One jin of medicine per mu is enough.
    Calcium Arsenate
    Calcium arsenate is a stomach poison, which is very effective for general chewing mouthparts pests, such as flea beetles and sawflies, and is especially more effective for Orthoptera and Coleoptera than lead arsenate.
    Application method: There are two types, liquid and powder. The liquid method is generally simpler, but the powder method is better for crops with hairy leaves. The two methods are described as follows:
    (A) Liquid method: According to the ratio of one part (by weight) of calcium arsenate to two hundred parts of water, put it in a bucket, put the calcium arsenate in and stir it fully, and then spray it on the front and back sides of the vegetable leaves with a sprayer. Stir at any time during spraying to avoid powder precipitation.
    (B) Powder method: According to the ratio of one part of calcium arsenate to one to two parts of fine slaked lime, the lime to be used must be sieved first, and then fully mixed with calcium arsenate before sprinkling in the early morning before the dew is dry.
    (C) One jin of medicine per mu is enough. Matters needing attention for lead arsenate and calcium arsenate:
    1. Lead arsenate and calcium arsenate are very toxic and should not be ingested by humans or animals. The residues and containers after application must be properly handled to prevent children and livestock from accidentally ingesting them. (It is best to bury the residual medicine in the soil)
    2. The medicine must be applied ten days before the vegetables mature. If they need to be harvested urgently, it is not advisable to apply the medicine.
    3. Arsenic cannot be mixed with soap or alkali.
    4. Do not apply medicine in rainy or windy weather. If it rains after applying the medicine, apply it again after the weather clears. Also, if the temperature is too high, the dilution multiple of the liquid should be increased, and the powder should be sprinkled thinly to avoid phytotoxicity.
    5. The prepared medicinal solution should be sprayed and used at any time and should not be stored for a long time.
    6. When using powder, if there is no dew, you can first sprinkle water on the leaves with a broom and then apply the medicine to make it easy to adhere.
    7. The leaves after application cannot be used to feed livestock.
    8. The medicinal powder should be stored in a dry place.
    9. The amount of medicine used per mu of vegetables or cotton varies depending on the size of the plants and the number of leaves. Generally, about one jin per mu is used.
    10. The larger the plant, the more medicine is needed, so it is most economical to spray the medicine when the pests first occur in the seedling stage of the crop.
    11. This agent is prone to phytotoxicity to leguminous plants and rosaceae stone fruits such as peaches, plums, and apricots, so it should not be used.
    12. This agent does not cause phytotoxicity to fruit trees such as pears, apples, grapes, and persimmons when sprinkled before early July, but it is prone to phytotoxicity when used from mid-July to August when the temperature rises.

　　防治虫害的几种药剂
    华北人民政府农业部
    六氯苯（俗称六、六、六、）
    六氯苯是继Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．之后所发明的新综合有机化合物杀虫剂，同时具有胃毒、触杀及薰蒸三种作用，其有效杀虫成分为“克灭杀”（Ｇａｍｍｘａｎｅ），简称Ｇ．Ｉ，故六、六、六之杀虫力量通常以Ｇ．Ｉ．之含量高低来决定。此药用以防治蝼蛄比信石好：（一）药力强；（二）价格便宜，每亩地用药二两至四两，只合小米一斤（即一斤小米可以防治一亩地蝼蛄）；（三）信石对土壤有害，六、六、六，则无害。
    性状：克灭杀为无色结晶体，不溶于水，但可溶于有机溶剂中，化学性很稳定，对光热及酸均不起作用，但遇碱性物则发生反应而分解，其各种同素体的混合物为棕色粉状，味苦，有强烈的酸霉味，杀虫力强大，一经接触或吞食后即可致虫于死命，而绝无复活机会，并具有持久残余毒力，毒力之速比Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．为大。
    施用方法：六、六、六对各种农作物害虫均有相当强大的毒效，举凡直翅目、鞘翅目、鳞翅目昆虫多可用以防治。兹将重要害虫之防治方法分述如下：
    ①防治飞蝗：
    甲、毒饵：麦麸一份（一斤）水十份（十斤）
    药量：每斤麦麸中含千分之三Ｇ．Ｉ．的６．６．６．一克，（另配加糖或植物油少许以增引诱力）。此法用于四龄以下之蝗群效果较佳。
    用法：于早晨起至午前撒布于蝗区内之作物或草地上，每亩用量视地形及蝗群数目与龄期而不同，通常每亩用饵二——六斤。
    乙、粉剂：治蝗用六、六、六须含Ｇ．Ｉ．千分之一——千分之五者为宜。施用量随蝗区植物环境及蝗群之数目、龄期不同而有差别，防治初龄幼蝻每亩用含千分之三（Ｇ．Ｉ．）者——四斤，对四——五龄或飞蝗应用含千分之五Ｇ．Ｉ．６．６．６．二斤——四斤。
    此药可直接喷于植物或草地上，或在一个区域内喷药将蝗喃驱至施药地，蝗虫爬上附着药粉之植物时，决死无生。
    ②防治蝼蛄：
    甲、毒饵：麦麸一份　水一份。
    药量每斤湿麸中拌入含千分之三　Ｇ．Ｉ．的６．６．６．三克，配加生油或粗糖水。每亩用量二——四斤。于黄昏前撒布于发见蝼蛄为害植物之土面，一至三天后田间便可陆续发现部分已死或已半死的蝼蛄僵卧土面（一部份能回土中，则死于土中）。任灌溉或雨后施用，效果更为显著。
    乙、毒谷：将谷子煮熟取出稍晾干，将药混入其量含Ｇ．Ｉ．６．６．６．千分之三即可，用时如浓度高之６．６．６．可混合相当之黄豆粉，使易于附着然后将药拌煮熟之谷子，随播种时播下，每亩约用毒谷四——八斤，视蝼蛄为害程度而异，此法目的在毒杀蝼蛄保护未发芽种子在土中免被蝼蛄吃去。
    ③防除稻蝗及稻苞虫：粉剂或液剂须用含Ｇ．Ｉ．千分之三的６．６．６．于早晨喷于稻叶上，每亩用量三——六斤。
    ④防治十字花科之猿叶虫、菜白蝶、小菜蛾或黄跳蚤＠（菜跳蚤）：对此类为害白菜之幼虫或成虫可用含千分之二Ｇ．Ｉ．的６．６．６．粉剂于清晨撒布被害叶上（菜蛾应撒布于菜心中），每亩用量二——四斤，视作物大小而异。
    ⑤防治大绿浮尘子：可用含千分之二Ｇ．Ｉ．６．６．６．粉或液，撒布于被害作物上，每亩用量二——八斤，视作物大小而异。
    ⑥防治切根虫：毒饵配合量（参考飞蝗的防治）。于黄昏前撒布于被害作物附近。
    ⑦防治行军虫（黏虫）：用含千分之三Ｇ．Ｉ．的６．６．６．粉剂或液剂撒布或喷射于被害作物上每亩用量三——八斤，视作物大小而异。
    此外对蚜虫类、鳞翅目幼虫、甲虫类之金龟子、象鼻虫、金针虫、金花虫以及蝇、蚤、虫及仓库害虫，均有特别之功效。
    使用时应注意的几点：
    ①六、六、六、粉或液不能与石灰水、石灰或碱混合用。
    ②六、六、六、对瓜类作物必生药害，故不能施用于瓜类。
    ③六、六、六、可与Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．硫黄粉或砒酸钙合用。
    滴滴涕（Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．）
    性状：滴滴涕（Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．），为一种综合之氯化有机化合物，具有胃毒及触杀两作用，其特点不在迅速杀死害虫，而在其有持久毒性，为一般杀虫药剂所不能及。滴滴涕除不能与石灰硫黄液或碱、肥皂混用外，可与各种杀虫杀菌剂混合使用。
    防治农作物害虫：用于防治若干农作物害虫，效果很显著。通常可使用喷雾器将Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．直接使用于作物上，药剂分布宜均匀，不必直接喷于虫体上，喷于被害作物叶茎上，便可生效。每亩约用十两左右。
    （１）咀嚼口器害虫：对于梨步曲、枣步曲的幼虫、猿叶虫、青虫、菜跳蚤，稻包虫等都很有效，在清晨露水未干时用喷粉器将百分之三的Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．粉撒布于作物上，喷粉要匀，通常每亩用药量三至五斤。如水湿性Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．或Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．乳剂直接放于水中，便可应用，通常每亩用药四至八斤，视作物大小栽培密度及虫子密度而异。
    （２）吸收口器害虫：对蚜虫、菜椿象及各种蔬菜果树之浮尘子也有效，同时蚜虫及浮尘子，能将毒素从有病株传至无病株，这种虫可用百分之三的Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．粉防治，每亩用药三至五市斤。如用水湿性Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．或Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．乳剂则用含百分之一至二浓度之液体，每亩需要药量四至八斤。
    （３）蝼蛄：以含百分之二的Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．水液（以水湿性Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．加水而成），灌注于发见蝼蛄为害之苗床或苗圃的土面，每平方尺用药约为四两，并无药害，此法用于烟草苗床，效果颇著。
    但此药应注意：
    （１）Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ，有毒不能入口。
    （２）Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ，溶液有渗入皮肤可能，不得与皮肤多接触。
    （３）Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ，不能与石灰硫黄液或碱混用，以免毒效消失。
    （４）Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ，不宜防治瓜类害虫，因其能阻碍瓜类生长。
    （５）曾施用Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．之蔬菜，宜慎加洗涤以免中毒，因Ｄ．Ｄ．Ｔ．有持久毒性，故蔬果残屑不宜饲喂家畜。
    苦树皮
    苦树皮之根茎叶花均有杀虫效力，其中以多年根皮为最佳，茎叶次之，花果更次之。
    土法调制有粉剂与液剂两种——（一）粉剂：将叶或根皮晒干，投入锅中用慢火炒燥，待有刺激奇臭发出，即取出捣成粉末。使用方法，趁早晨朝露未干时，用罗或粗布袋撒到白菜叶面，以治猿叶虫的成虫和幼虫。
    （二）苦树皮之根皮一至二斤，加水三至六斤泡煮成原液，用时以每斤皮加食盐四两，兑水三十斤至四十斤的比例稀释，用喷雾器喷洒蔬菜叶上，治猿叶虫很有效力。
    砒酸铅
    胃毒剂，对于卷叶虫、蔬菜青虫、棉造桥虫、果树上之食叶害虫均可应用，特别是对鳞翅目的幼虫，比较砒酸钙效力大。
    施用方法：有液用粉用两种，可随意采用，兹分述如次：
    （甲）液用法：按水二百份砒酸铅一份至二份（重量）之比例，将砒酸铅装入细布袋中，然后放入量好之水中，用手缓缓揉搓，待砒酸铅完全揉出后，再用棒搅拌，使砒酸铅均匀分布水中，然后喷用之。在喷射时随时搅拌以免药粉沉淀。
    （乙）粉用法：将砒酸铅一斤配合过筛之细石炭粉一至二斤调和均匀后，置于喷粉器中，于早晨露未干时撒布于被害作物上。
    （丙）每亩用药一斤即可。
    砒酸钙
    砒酸钙是胃毒剂，对于一般咀嚼口器之害虫很有效力，如猿叶虫、锯蜂等特别对直翅目、鞘翅目较砒酸铅效力大。
    施用方法：有液用、粉用两种，普遍液用较为简便，但叶上有毛之作物以粉用法为佳，兹分述两种用法如次：
    （甲）液用法：按水二百份砒酸钙一份（重量）之比例盛于桶中，将砒酸钙放入充分搅拌后，再用喷雾器喷布菜叶正反面上，喷射中随时搅拌以免药粉沉淀。
    （乙）粉用法：按砒酸钙一份，细熟石灰一份至二份之比例配合，惟所用之石灰须先筛过，再与砒酸钙充分混匀后于早晨露未干前撒布之。
    （丙）每亩药一斤即可。砒酸铅及砒酸钙应注意事项：
    １、砒酸铅、砒酸钙，毒力甚强人畜均不可入口，施用后之残屑及盛器，均须妥慎处理，以免小孩及牲畜误食。（残药最好埋入土中）
    ２、施用药剂须在蔬菜成熟前十日，如急须收获即不宜施药。
    ３、砒素不可与肥皂或碱混用。
    ４、天雨大风时不宜施药，施药后如遇天雨晴天后须再施一次，又如温度过高液用须将稀释倍数加大，粉用则宜薄薄撒布，免生药害。
    ５、药液制好随时喷用不宜久置。
    ６、粉用时如无露水可先用扫帚洒水于叶上，再行施药使易于粘着。
    ７、施用后之叶不可喂家畜。
    ８、药粉要放干燥处。
    ９、每亩蔬菜或棉花之用药量，当视植物大小及叶片多少而异，普通每亩约一市斤。
    １０、植物愈大，须用药量愈多，故能于作物幼苗期害虫初发生时候喷洒药剂最为经济。
    １１、本剂对于豆科植物及蔷薇科核果类，果树桃、李、杏等易起药害，不宜使用。
    １２、本剂对于梨、苹果、葡萄、柿子等果树，在七月上旬以前撒布不起药害，但入七月中旬至八月气温上升后使用就容易起药害。
