    To Defend Factories and Protect Spring Plowing
    North China Strengthens Public Security
    Overcome Complacency Due to Victory
    [This Newspaper Despatch] Armed departments in various areas of North China are beginning to pay attention to social public security work. Due to the rapid collapse and disintegration of the Kuomintang rule, many Kuomintang stragglers and local landlords and rich peasants have sneaked into our rear areas to disrupt and sabotage social order, engaging in arson, highway robbery, and other bandit activities. Armed departments in various regions have issued instructions, calling on the militia and armed masses to, in addition to continuing to support the front lines, regard safeguarding the revolutionary social order as an extremely important current task, and must prevent and overcome numbness and complacency. The Jinzhong Armed Forces Department convened a meeting of district and county armed forces departments to specifically discuss and deploy this work. The Jinzhong Armed Forces Department emphasized: starting from safeguarding the masses' production and preventing sabotage by bandits and special agents, we must carry out extensive mobilization and in-depth propaganda to the masses. Jinzhong also instructed all districts and counties to, according to the specific circumstances, organize the militia in a planned way to establish a joint defense headquarters to prevent the activities of bandits and special agents. The militia companies organized by various counties in the Chahar Province have established a joint defense, effectively cracking down on the activities of bandits and special agents. In counties such as Liangxiang, Wanping, Fangshan, Laiyuan, and Yi County, more than 500 bandits and special agents who robbed the masses and carried out sabotage have been eliminated, stabilizing the local social order and enabling the masses to engage in production with peace of mind. The Taiyue District leadership has also paid attention to this work, and order has gradually become stable. The Ji-Lu-Yu District has also emphasized the joint defense of the masses, especially in the areas south of the Yellow River, where many villages and villages in counties and districts have been linked up for joint defense, with sentries patrolling at night. Once bandits and special agents are discovered, they immediately sound the bells and drums to encircle and capture them, and considerable results have now been achieved.
    A relatively common phenomenon throughout the region is that many cadres and masses believe that the whole country will soon be victorious and that the Kuomintang is finished, and ignore the harm of hidden Kuomintang bandits, special agents, and saboteurs. As a result, a serious sense of complacency has arisen, and weapons have been put away, some guns have become rusty or damaged, and armed cadres have failed to promptly inspect and lead the militia or organize the masses to maintain social order. The masses cannot engage in production and construction with peace of mind, and all localities must pay close attention to this work.

    保卫工厂保护春耕
    华北各地加强治安
    克服因胜而骄的太平观念
    【本报讯】华北各区武装部门正开始注意社会公安工作。由于国民党统治的迅速崩溃与瓦解，不少的国民党散兵游勇与返籍的地富分子，潜入我后方扰乱破坏社会秩序，进行放火、夺路、抢劫等盗匪行为。各区武装部门已发下指示，号召民兵及群众武装除继续支援前线外应将保卫社会革命秩序看成当前极重要的工作，必须防止与克服麻木不仁的太平观念。晋中武装部召开了分区与县武装部会议，具体讨论与布置了这一工作。晋中武装部强调提出：从保卫群众生产，严防匪、特破坏分子的群众切身利益出发向群众作广泛的动员和深入的宣传。晋中并指示各分区县须根据具体情况有计划的组织民兵建立联防指挥部防止匪特的活动。察哈尔省各县组织的民兵连已成立了联防，有力的打击了匪特的活动，良乡、宛平、房山、涞源、易县等县，已歼灭了五百余抢掠群众的匪特及破坏分子，稳定了当地的社会秩序，使群众能安心生产。太岳区领导上亦注意了这一工作，秩序已渐趋稳定。冀鲁豫区亦强调了群众的联防，特别是黄河南岸地区有不少县区的村与村之间已联防起来，夜间放哨巡逻，一旦发现匪特，即鸣钟、鼓合围捕捉，现已收到不少成绩。
    全区比较普遍的现象则是不少干部、群众认为全国快胜利了、国民党完蛋了，而忽视了隐藏的国民党匪特及破坏分子的危害性。因而产生了严重太平麻痹观念，而将武器放起来，有的将枪放的生了锈或者放毁了，武装干部不及时的检查与领导民兵或组织群众起来维持社会秩序，则群众不能安心的从事生产建设，各地必须高度注意这一工作。
