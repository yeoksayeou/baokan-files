　　Dutch Communist Party General Secretary Gerö Speaks Out
  　Against Dutch-Indonesian "Agreement" and Demands Withdrawal of Troops from Indonesia
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] TASS, The Hague: The Dutch Parliament held a meeting in mid-May to debate the so-called "agreement" established in Batavia on the 7th of this month between the Dutch delegation and the Hatta group. The debate concluded on the 19th. The ruling Catholic Freedom Party and the Labour Party supported this "agreement." In his speech to the Parliament, the General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, Gerö, exposed that the "agreement" between Dutch imperialism and Hatta aimed to suffocate the Indonesian liberation movement, because the Drees government's plan to destroy the Indonesian national liberation movement by force had failed. Gerö analyzed the current actions of Dutch and American imperialism in Indonesia, stating that what is currently being established in Indonesia is a fascist system, not order and peace. Gerö sharply criticized the Dutch Labour Party, pointing out that the party bears full responsibility for the bloody war in Indonesia, the deaths of Dutch soldiers, the sacrifices of the Indonesian people, and the establishment of a fascist dictatorship. He emphasized that the current Dutch government's policy in Indonesia is determined by the United States, which is eager to exploit Indonesia's strategic raw materials. However, the Indonesian people no longer believe in any promises made by the Drees government, nor do they believe in Sukarno or Hatta. The Indonesian people's resistance is growing. Gerö finally, on behalf of the Communist Party caucus in Parliament, demanded the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia, granting the Indonesian people full freedom, and restoring trade unions and democratic parties.

　　荷共总书记格罗特演说
  　反对荷印“协议”　要求自印尼撤军
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰国会曾于本月中旬开会辩论荷兰代表团与哈达集团本月七日在巴达维亚成立的所谓“协议”。十九日辩论结束。执政的天主教自由党与劳工党赞成这一“协议”。何兰共产党总书记格罗特在国会的演说中，揭露荷兰帝国主义与哈达之间的“协议”，旨在窒息印尼的解放运动，因为德里斯政府之以武力破坏印尼民族解放运动的计划已经失败。格罗特分析荷兰与美国帝国主义目前在印尼的行动称：目前在印尼建立的是法西斯制度而不是秩序与和平。格罗特尖锐地抨击荷兰劳工党，指出该党应对印尼的血腥战争、荷兰士兵的死亡、印尼人民的牺牲以及法西斯独裁的建立负完全责任。他强调称：目前荷兰政府在印尼的政策是由美国决定的，美国正急于要利用印尼的战略原料。但印尼人民已不再相信德里斯政府所作的任何诺言，他们也不相信苏加诺或哈达。印尼人民的抵抗正在增长中。格罗特最后代表国会共产党党团要求由印尼撤退荷军，给印尼人民以充分自由，恢复职工会和民主政党。
