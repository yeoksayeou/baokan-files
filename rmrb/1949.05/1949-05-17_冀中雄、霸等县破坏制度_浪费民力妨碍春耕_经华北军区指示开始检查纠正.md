　　Disruption of Systems, Waste of Labor, and Hindrance of Spring Plowing in Xiong, Ba, and Other Counties in Central Hebei
  　Inspection and Correction Initiated Following Instructions from the North China Military Region
    [This newspaper dispatch] The illegal mobilization and waste of manpower and animal power in Ba County, Xincheng, Xiong County, and the Tenth District of Central Hebei are hindering mass production. The North China People's Government and the North China Military Region Headquarters have stipulated that the mobilization of civilian labor must be submitted to higher authorities for approval in advance. This is especially important during the spring plowing and sowing season; however, Ba County, on March 22nd, not only failed to request instructions and approval but also failed to conduct prior investigations of transportation routes, blindly dispatching carts to the eighth district of Wenxin County to transport firewood. Upon arrival in Wenxin County, the county had not concentrated the firewood, forcing the carts to be dispersed to various villages, which delayed them for several days and wasted a considerable amount of manpower and animal power. Furthermore, on April 2nd, carts were dispatched to Shengfang to haul reed firewood, but due to a failure to investigate beforehand, transportation difficulties were discovered on the spot, delaying them for an additional four days and wasting considerable manpower and animal power. Later, carts were dispatched to Langfang to transport cotton seeds, but they turned back due to a damaged bridge, making a futile round trip of a hundred li. More seriously, the county government, the county armed forces department, the county political department, the county public security bureau, the county post office, and the eighth district government, in order to construct their own offices, illegally mobilized civilian laborers, carpenters, bricklayers, carts, etc., without requesting instructions. Xincheng and Xiong County also engaged in this illegal mobilization and waste of labor. Xincheng mobilized carts to Dingxin to haul grain, but the procedures were not completed in advance, and many workdays were wasted because the person in charge of grain could not be found upon arrival of the carts. In March, the Xincheng County Government, the County Armed Forces Department, the County Political Department, and the County Brigade also illegally mobilized civilian laborers sporadically. In March, the Xiong County Production Promotion Society opened canals in the Daqing River to irrigate the land without submitting a request to the district, and it unilaterally approved the mobilization of numerous carts and civilian laborers. It failed twice due to a lack of precise planning. This serious phenomenon of wasting manpower and animal power did not attract attention until the Armed Forces Department of the North China Military Region instructed the Armed Forces Department of the district to conduct inspections on April 2nd. The following inspections were made: (1) The spirit of adhering to the duty system and being responsible to the masses was insufficient. Those who did not need to be sent were sent, those who should have been sent less were sent more, and those who should have been sent later were sent urgently. (2) There was a lack of government and discipline, indulging in independence. Civilian labor was mobilized without requesting instructions or reporting, thinking "taking care of their own affairs themselves," and not paying attention to or implementing the higher authorities' instructions against waste, while emphasizing their own special circumstances to excuse themselves. (3) Mobilization was blind, without prior planning or preparation. (4) After mobilizing civilian laborers, management was poor or there was no management, reducing efficiency and prolonging the time spent. Furthermore, the masses in the new areas mistakenly believed that the burden of our duties was "without end," and some therefore went out to avoid duty, neglecting their land. (5) The in-depth inspection work was very poor, the bureaucratic work style was growing, they were not concerned about the people's suffering, and the opposition to waste was only stopped at lip service, without inspection, without strict correction, or the irresponsible attitude of considering the matter finished after it was over.

　　冀中雄、霸等县破坏制度
  　浪费民力妨碍春耕
    经华北军区指示开始检查纠正
    【本报讯】冀中十分区霸县、新城、雄县非法动员与浪费人力畜力，妨碍群众生产，华北人民政府暨华北军区司令部已有规定，动员民力必须事先呈请上级机关批准。在此春耕播种期间尤为重要；但霸县却于三月二十二日不仅不经请示与批准，并且对交通路线事先不作调查，盲目调派大车去文新县八区运柴，至文新县后，该县并未将柴集中，不得不把大车分散至各村，就此耽误数日，浪费人畜力不少。又在四月二日调大车赴胜芳拉苇柴，亦因未作调查，临时发现交通不便，多耽误了四天，浪费不少人力畜力。后又调大车去廊房运棉花籽，也因桥坏折回，徒劳往返百里。更严重的如县政府、县武装部、县政治处、县公安局、县邮政局、八区区政府，为建设自己机关，为经请示，非法动用民工、木匠、瓦匠、大车等。新城、雄县亦有此非法动员浪费民力之行为。新城动员大车去定新拉粮，事先未办好手续，车到后因找不着管粮人，浪费许多工。新城三月份县政府县武装部、县政治处、县大队非法零星动用民工亦不少。雄县生产推进社在三月份于大清河开渠浇地，未呈请分区，擅自批准动用不少大车与民工，并因缺乏精确的计划两次失败。此种严重浪费人力畜力的现象，直至华北军区武装部四月二日指示该分区武装部检查后，才引起注意，作了如下检查：（一）坚持动员职勤制度，为群众负责的精神不够，不必派的派了，该少派的多派了，该缓派的急派了。（二）无政府无纪律，闹独立性，动员民力不请示，不报告，自以为“自己的事自己办”，对上级的反浪费指示不重视，不执行，并强调特殊，原谅自己。（三）盲目的动员，事前无计划，无准备。（四）动员民工后，管理不好或无人管理，减低效率，多走时日。并且使新区群众误会我之勤务负担“没有头”，有些因此出外躲勤，荒废土地。（五）对深入检查工作很差，官僚主义作风滋长，不关心人民痛苦，反浪费只是停止在口头上，不去检查，不严格纠正，或事过就算了的不负责任态度。
