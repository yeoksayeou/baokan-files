    Taiyuan Military Control Commission Punishes Corruption
    Dismisses Xu Qingyu
    [Taiyuan Dispatch] In order to rectify discipline, the Highway Motorcycle Takeover Team of the Taiyuan Military Control Commission convened a meeting of all employees of the "Li Xing Auto Repair Shop" on the 8th. The meeting announced the dismissal of Xu Qingyu, the military representative of the unit. Although Xu Qingyu had achieved results in the takeover of the unit, he committed relatively serious errors of corruption, selfishness, lack of organization, and lack of discipline. Upon entering the factory, this comrade turned on the gasoline engine to power the lights without requesting instructions, and arbitrarily used the sealed white cloth to cover the sofa. He was not humble in his work and did not consult with other comrades for discussion. In particular, when exchanging silver dollars, he, in the name of the takeover personnel, centralized everyone’s silver dollars for exchange, lowering the exchange rate. He then gave a portion of the exchanged silver dollars to his brother in the city for business, and during the curfew, he used a special pass to order takeover member Comrade Wang to send his brother out of the city gate. After Xu Qingyu admitted his mistakes at the meeting, Huo Qinglin, the military general representative of the Highway Motorcycle Team, announced the Military Control Commission’s punishment for Xu Qingyu: 1. Dismiss Xu Qingyu from his position as military representative. 2. Compensate all affected employees in full according to the government-stipulated exchange rate ratio. The employees present were very satisfied with this handling.

    太原军管会惩处贪污
    撤销许庆玉职务
    【太原电】太原军管会公路摩托接管组为了整顿纪律，在八日召开的“理兴汽车修理厂”全体员工会。撤销该单位军事代表许庆玉的职务。许庆玉在接管该单位的工作中，虽获有成绩，但却犯了较为严重的贪污自私和无组织无纪律的错误。该同志于进入该厂时，未经请示即开动汽油机点电灯，并擅自动用已查封了的白布来罩沙发。在工作上不虚心，与别的同志商量讨论。特别是在兑换银元时，他以接管人员的名义集中大家现洋兑换，压低兑换率。并将兑换的一部现洋给他兄弟在城内作买卖，在戒严期间用特许通行证令接管员王同志将他兄弟送出城门。许庆玉在会议上承认错误后，由公路摩托组军事总代表霍清林向大家宣布了军管会给许庆玉的处分：一、撤销许庆玉军事代表职。二、按政府规定兑换比值如数补偿各受损员工。到会员工对此处理甚感满意。
