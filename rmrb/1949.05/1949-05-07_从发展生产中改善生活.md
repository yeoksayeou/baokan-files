    Improving Life Through Developing Production
    The democratic reform of labor-capital relations in the privately owned China Toothbrush Factory, entirely as Comrade Li Lisan indicated in his article "Several Statements on the Policy of Developing Production and Benefiting Both Labor and Capital," takes "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital" as the starting point for resolving labor-capital issues, proving that this is the only correct way to solve the problem. The workers of the factory, with the attitude of being masters of the country, combined their own vital interests with the interests of developing production. When business was not very good, they voluntarily lowered their wages so that production would not collapse, workers would not lose their jobs, and capitalists would not be unprofitable or lose money, thereby gradually achieving the goal of developing production. The capitalists also concretely experienced the authenticity of our Party's policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, which motivated their enthusiasm for actively managing production and began to implement certain reforms, actively managing and expanding production together with the workers.
    It is not to say that the lives of the workers at the China Toothbrush Factory should not be improved; no, the Party's policy is to raise the living standards of all the people of the country. As the lives of all the people of the country gradually improve, the lives of the working class can also improve accordingly. To achieve this, it is necessary to, as Comrade Li Lisan instructed: "Strive to develop production, promote economic prosperity, and the working class must have the spirit of enduring hardship first and enjoying comfort later, to set an example for the people of the whole country." Regarding the national bourgeoisie, they should be treated as friends, united with them, and all legitimate positive aspects of private capital should be utilized, and all possible private capital should be mobilized to invest in production. Capitalists should be encouraged to participate in this cause of developing production. Only when production is greatly developed can the lives of the working class improve accordingly. This is the benefit of developing production for the working class.
    Based on their respective personal experiences, and after studying Comrade Li Lisan's explanation of the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, the labor and capital parties of the China Toothbrush Factory improved their understanding, used democratic consultation methods to remove all obstacles to developing production, so that production could continue to develop gradually. This experience can be used as a reference for other regions.

    从发展生产中改善生活
    私营中国牙刷工厂劳资关系的民主改革，完全有如立三同志在“关于发展生产劳资两利政策的几点声明”一文所指示的，是以“发展生产，劳资两利”为解决劳资问题的出发点，证明这是唯一的正确的解决问题的办法。该厂工人以国家主人翁的姿态把自己切身利益同发展生产利益结合起来，在生意不十分好的情形下主动的降低工资，使生产不致坍台，工人不致失业，使资本家不致无利可图，不致亏本，这样来逐步达到发展生产的目的。资方也具体体验到我党发展生产劳资两利政策的真实性，激励了自己积极经营生产的企业心，开始实行某些改革，同工人一道积极经营，扩大生产。
    并不是说，中国牙刷工厂工人的生活就不要改善了，不是的，党的政策就是要提高全国人民生活水准，全国人民生活逐渐改善了，工人阶级生活也就可能随着改善，要做到这一点，就必须依立三同志所指示的：“努力发展生产，繁荣经济，工人阶级要有吃苦在先，享乐在后的精神，来做全国人民的表率”。对于民族资产阶级，应当把他们当作朋友来团结他，利用一切正当私人资本的积极性，动员一切可能的私人资本，投入生产事业中来，鼓励资本家参加这一发展生产事业，只有生产大大向前发展了，工人阶级生活才会随着改善，这就是发展生产对工人阶级的好处。
    中国牙刷工厂的劳资双方依据各自切身体验，经过学习立三同志对发展生产劳资两利政策的说明，提高了认识，用民主协议方法去掉一切发展生产的障碍，使生产得以继续下去逐渐发展，这一经验可供各地参考。
