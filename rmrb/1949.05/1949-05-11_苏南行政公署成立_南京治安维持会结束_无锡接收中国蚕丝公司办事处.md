    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Wuxi, 10th Message: The Su'nan Administrative Office was formally established on April 27th under the order of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The director is Guan Wenwei, and the deputy directors are Liu Jiping and Chen Guodong. The administrative office governs the directly administered city of Wuxi and four districts: Zhenjiang District, Wujin District, Suzhou District, and ×Jiang District, with a total of twenty-seven counties. The Su'nan Administrative Office is located in Wuxi.
    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 10th Message: The Nanjing Security Maintenance Association, which was organized by Ma Qingyuan, a senior counselor of the former Nanjing Kuomintang government's Ministry of National Defense, and Wu Yifang, president of Ginling Women's College, after the Kuomintang bandit troops fled Nanjing on April 23rd and before the entry of the People's Liberation Army, has announced its dissolution. The association played a role in maintaining social order and reducing damage to public property for the broad masses of citizens. With the establishment of the Nanjing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army on April 28th, the association announced its dissolution on the 29th. The maintenance expenses advanced by the association, equivalent to 100,000 RMB, and the 23,670 RMB spent on purchasing firewood and grass for the PLA troops entering the city, have been audited and fully reimbursed by the Military Control Commission. Ma Qingyuan, the chairman of the association, has also been appointed as a senior counselor by the Military Control Commission.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 9th] The Wuxi Military Control Commission has completed the takeover of the Wuxi office of the China Silk Company, which belonged to Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital. On the second day of the Military Control Commission's entry into the city (April 25th), military representatives were dispatched to take over the office and its subordinate Third Experimental Sericulture Guidance Headquarters, as well as the Jiangsu office of the Production and Sales Coordination Committee attached to the China Silk Company by the pseudo-Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Due to the positive influence of the People's Liberation Army's correct implementation of urban policies in various cities north of the Yangtze River, all workers, technicians, and staff of the above-mentioned units remained at their posts before the takeover and prepared partial inventories awaiting the takeover. After the military representatives convened a staff meeting to announce the takeover order and explain the policy towards former personnel, all staff members closely worked on compiling the inventory and handing over materials. The takeover was completed by the 19th. Wuxi is the center of the silk industry in southern Jiangsu, and one-fifth of the city's population relies on silk for their livelihood. The silk-producing area of Wuxi includes five counties: Wuxi, Danyang, Yixing, Changshu, and Jiangyin. Seventy percent of the silk is controlled by the Wuxi office of the China Silk Company. Other silk-producing counties in the Taihu Lake area, such as Jintan, Wujiang, Suzhou, and Wuxian, also mostly concentrate their silk in this company. Due to the company's past cruel exploitation, the enthusiasm of farmers for silkworm rearing has greatly declined in recent years, leading to a gradual decline in the silk industry. In the year before last, the Wuxi office of the China Silk Company collected 110,972 dan of fresh cocoons, but last year it only collected 69,083 dan, a sharp decrease of 38 percent in one year.

    【北平新华广播电台广播】无锡十号消息：苏南行政公署已经在上月二十七日奉中国人民解放军华东军区命令正式成立。主任是管文蔚，副主任是刘季平、陈国栋。行署下辖无锡直属市和镇江分区、武进分区、苏州分区、×江分区等四个分区，一共有二十七个县。苏南行政公署设在无锡。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】南京十号消息：国民党匪军在四月二十三日逃出南京以后解放军进城以前，曾经由前南京国民党政府国防部高级参议马青苑和金陵女子大学校长吴贻芳等组的织南京治安维持会，已经宣告结束。该会曾经在××广大市民维持社会秩序，减轻公物破坏上起了若干作用，四月二十八日人民解放军南京市军事管制委员会成立，该会就在二十九日宣告结束。该会所垫用维持费折合人民币十万元和解放军进城部隧购置柴草费人民币两万三千六百七十元，也已经军管会审核，全部发还。该会主任委员马青苑并且已经被军管会聘任为高级参议。
    【新华社无锡九日电】无锡市军事管制委员会已将属于国民党官僚资本的中国蚕丝公司无锡办事处接收完毕。军管会入城的第二天（四月二十五日），即派出军事代表接收该办事处及其所属之第三实验育蚕指导总所，以及伪农林部附设于中蚕公司的产销协导委员会江苏办事处。由于人民解放军在江北各城市中正确执行城市政策的良好影响，上述各单位全体工人、技术人员及职员等在接收前均各守原职，并造好部分清册等候接收。在军事代表召开员工大会宣布接管命令，说明对旧人员的政策后，全体员工即紧锡地造具清册点交物资，至张十九日即接收完毕。按无二为江南蚕丝业中心，该市人口五分之一赖蚕丝为生。无锡产丝区包括无锡、丹阳、宜兴、常熟、江阴等五县，蚕丝十之七均为中蚕公司无锡办事处控制，太湖地区其他产蚕县份为金坛、吴江、苏州、吴县等地，蚕丝也大部集中于该公司。由于该公司过去的残酷掠夺，近年来农民养蚕情绪大为低落，致蚕丝事业日渐衰退。前年中蚕公司无锡办事处收进鲜茧十一万零九百七十二担，至去年则仅收六万九千零八十三担，一年中即锐减百分之三十八。
