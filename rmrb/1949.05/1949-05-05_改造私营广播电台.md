    Reforming Private Radio Stations
    After the liberation, some private radio stations in Beiping continued to broadcast lewd and pornographic songs all day long, causing dissatisfaction among the broad masses of people, who unanimously believed that such a bad phenomenon should not be allowed to exist in a people's city. We fully agree with this opinion.
    Radio stations are one of the modern propaganda tools, and also the most direct and powerful weapon for educating the masses. They have a very close connection with the masses in the city. Even a small amount of poison spread by them will be a great harm to the people. During the Kuomintang rule, radio stations used low-taste and erotic literature to lure listeners, using methods of麻醉 (má zuì, anaesthetizing) the people to earn money, in order to achieve profit-making purposes. In fact, they served the ruling class and acted as a loudspeaker for the ruling class to麻醉 (má zuì, anaesthetize) and poison the people's consciousness. Now that Beiping has been liberated, a new social order is being established step by step, and the people's awakening is also being raised step by step. They are very disgusted with this麻醉 (má zuì, anaesthetizing) agent. They demand that private radio stations carry out necessary reforms. Morbid music should be stopped and replaced by the majestic voice of the people. The people's city can only issue the people's voices. This demand is completely correct and reasonable.
    This requires strengthening the supervision and leadership of private radio stations. Turning a blind eye to the natural flow of events is an irresponsible performance to the people and must be overcome. We must tell these private radio stations what programs they should broadcast, stipulate some broadcast content, help them solve some difficulties, and educate them with the principles of New Democracy, so that they understand the fundamental differences between the old and new societies, understand what should be promoted and what should be opposed, so as to further improve the broadcasting work. We hope that the government will set up a special agency to contact them and politically guarantee specific leadership over private radio stations, and must not allow them to continue to flow freely and harm the people.

    改造私营广播电台
    解放后的北平某些私营广播电台仍然整日播送淫荡色情歌曲，引起广大人民的不满，一致认为如此恶劣现象在人民城市里不应允许存在。这种意见，我们完全赞成。
    广播电台是近代化的宣传工具之一，也是教育人民大众最直接的有力武器，在城市里同群众有着极密切的连系。只要他散布一点点毒素，对于人民便是很大的损害。在国民党统治时候的电台曾用低级趣味，色情文艺来引诱听众，用麻醉人民的方法来赚人民的钱，借以达到营利目的，实际上是为统治阶级服务，作了统治人民麻醉毒害人民意识的一个喇叭筒。现在北平解放了，新的社会秩序正在一步一步建立，人民的觉醒也在一步一步提高，他们对于这种麻醉剂已十分厌弃憎恶，他们要求私营广播电台进行必要的改革，靡靡之音应该停止而代之以人民大众的雄壮声音，人民的城市只能发出人民的呼声，这种要求是完全正确的，合理的。
    这就必须加强对私营广播电台的监督和领导。充耳不闻的自流现象是对人民不负责任的表现，必须加以克服。要告诉这些私营广播电台应该播送的节目，规定一些广播内容，帮助他们解决一些困难，教育他们以新民主主义的道理，使他们懂得新旧社会的根本区别，懂得应该发扬什么，反对什么，从而进一步改进播送工作。我们希望政府设立专门机构同他们连系，从政治上保证对私营广播电台的具体领导，切勿使之继续自流下去，贻害人民。
