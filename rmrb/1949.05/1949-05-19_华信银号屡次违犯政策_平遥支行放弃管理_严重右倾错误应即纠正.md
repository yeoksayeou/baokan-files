[Jinzhong News] On March 20th, the Jinzhong Branch of the People's Bank of China sent personnel to help the Pingyao Branch conduct a preliminary inspection of the business activities of the Huaxin Bank in the county. Numerous problems were discovered: The establishment of the bank was not approved by the former Jinzhong Administrative Office (now the Taiyuan Municipal Government). The bank's business charter stipulated that the capital would be provisionally set at 500,000 yuan and would be collected within three months of opening. More than four months have passed, and only 302,700 yuan has been raised. The bank's lending interest rate last year reached 1.5 to 1.8 percent per month, exceeding the People's Bank's highest lending rate of 1.5 percent per month. In February of this year, when the People's Bank tightened its currency supply and the market's money supply was tight, it privately raised the lending interest rate to 2.4 percent per month and issued a large number of commercial loans, fueling commercial speculation. At the same time, due to the large number of loans issued, the inventory was often only 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, accounting for only 13 percent of the funds, which did not meet the requirement that the inventory must maintain 30 percent of the funds. Furthermore, the bank itself had no branches and did not go through the state bank. It used private bank connections to fabricate black market remittances, remitting 653,000 yuan to Yuci, Changzhi, Shizhuang, Tianjin, Linfen and other places, without reporting to the state bank. Finally, it was found that the account privately absorbed a considerable number of deposits from public enterprises and stores using aliases and code names. After the Pingyao County Government held a symposium of public enterprises and stores in January to convey that all public funds should be deposited in the state bank, the branch repeatedly explained to the bank that it was not allowed to absorb public funds any more. However, this time it was found that there were many public funds that were missed last year and deposited again after the symposium. As mentioned above, the bank's filing procedures and the amount of funds were not sufficient to meet the conditions for establishment. After its establishment, it repeatedly violated policies and resisted management. Such a bank that illegally profited should be shut down. However, in order to deal with the matter prudently, the Taiyuan Municipal Government has been asked to instruct the Pingyao County Government to cooperate with the branch manager to continue to conduct an in-depth review and then deal with it. However, from the above materials, it can be seen that the Pingyao Branch has committed serious right-leaning errors in implementing the management of private banks and money shops, confusing the banks and money shops with industry and commerce. Therefore, at the beginning of the preparation of the Huaxin Bank, the branch manager Wang Kechang and the deputy manager Cheng Biao both signed the business charter as approvers. In December last year, in order to solve the problem of inventory backlog and fear of bearing interest, the branch successively lent the bank 14,000 yuan, losing its principled position and blindly supporting private banks and money shops. Therefore, although the branch had repeatedly instructed by the branch, it did not seriously conduct a systematic inspection of the bank's business on a regular basis, which made the bank dare to engage in illegal activities and repeatedly undermine policies. Therefore, the branch should immediately work with the county government to effectively deal with the bank, and strengthen the policy learning of cadres, so that everyone can learn to fight against all illegal activities of private merchants, especially the illegal activities of private banks and money shops.

　　华信银号屡次违犯政策
    平遥支行放弃管理
  　严重右倾错误应即纠正
    【晋中讯】三月二十日中国人民银行晋中分行派员帮助平遥支行，初步检查该县华信银号业务活动，发现不少问题：该号成立并未经前晋中行署（现太原市政府）批准，该号营业简章规定、资本暂定为五○○、○○○元，开张后三个月凑足，迄今四月有余，资本才凑起三○二、七○○元。该号放款利息去年就达月息百分之一五至一八，超过人民银行放款月息最高一五分的标准。今年二月间乘人民银行紧缩货币，市场银根显紧之际，又私自提高放款利息为月息二四分，并大量发放商贷，助长了商业投机。同时因大量放款，库存经常只三○、○○○元至五○、○○○元，仅占资金百分之一三，不合库存必须保持资金的百分之三○的规定。再次该号本身既未分支号，又不通过国家银行，利用私号关系捏造黑市汇兑，先后向榆次、长治、石庄、天津、临汾等地汇款六五三、○○○元，未给国家银行作过表报。最后又查出帐上私行吸收不少公营企业商店采用化名代号的存款。平遥县政府于一月召开公营企业商店座谈会传达公款一律存入国家银行以后，支行又多次向该号讲明，不准再吸收公款。但这次查出去年遗漏的和座谈会后又存的公款不少，如上所述该号备案手续，资金额数根本不够成立条件，成立后又逐次违犯政策抵抗管理，这种非法取利的银号，即应给以取消，但为慎重处理起见，已请示太原市政府指示平遥县政府协同支行经理继续深入复查，再做处理。但从以上材料看出平遥支行在执行对私人银钱业管理上，犯有严重右倾错误，把银钱业混同于工商业，因之在华信银号筹备之初，支行经理王克昌、副经理程彪都在营业简章上署名为赞成人，支行去年十二月为了解决库存积压怕背利息，曾先后贷予该号款一四、○○○元，失掉原则立场，盲目扶持私营银钱业。故虽在分行多次指示下，支行亦未认真定期对该号业务作有系统的检查，致使该号敢于非法活动一再破坏政策，故支行应即会同县府，对该号作有效处理，并加强干部政策学习，使大家学会向一切非法活动的私商，特别是私营银钱业非法活动作斗争。（王执中）
