    Visiting Several Figures from the "May Fourth" Era
    Bai Sheng
    On the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement in Beiping, the birthplace of the movement, this reporter made a special visit to several figures from that era.

    Yu Li, Deputy Director of the North China People's Government Supervisory Yuan, happily told the reporter that during the "May Fourth" Movement, he was a fourth-year student in the Chinese Literature Department of Beiping Higher Normal School (Normal University). At that time, there was a progressive organization in the school called the Work-Study Society, whose members were mostly students who worked part-time to support themselves, and Yu was one of them. When news of the Paris Peace Conference's decision on the Shandong issue reached Beiping, public opinion across the country was in an uproar, and the reaction of Beiping students was particularly strong. On "May Fourth," three-quarters of the students from the Higher Normal School participated in the rally in front of Tiananmen Square. After the meeting, led by Peking University, they rushed to Cao Rulin's residence, resulting in the historically famous scene of burning Zhao Jia Lou. Afterwards, students from the Higher Normal School continued to conduct propaganda on the streets and many were arrested. Yang Xiufeng, now Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government, was also a history and geography student at the Normal University who participated in the "May Fourth" Movement at that time. Zhao Shiyan (who sacrificed in the Great Revolution of 1927) and Xia Kangnong, both from the Normal University's attached middle school, and many other middle school students also participated in the movement.

    Mr. Yu Li stroked his beard and said happily that thirty years had passed, but all of this was still fresh in his memory. In the past, we were just daydreaming, and everything we expressed was completely the ideology of the petty bourgeoisie. Our actions were ignorant, without class consciousness, but rather transcending class. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, everything has been concretized. Young people have a compass and a direction, and the entire China has achieved new development.

    Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, is an elderly democratic veteran who is sixty-five years old this year. When he spoke emphatically about the events of the "May Fourth" era, he said that at that time, he was teaching in the Philosophy Department of Peking University. After the "May Fourth" Movement occurred, many students were arrested. At this time, there was no leader in the school, and the faculty and staff felt that they had to organize themselves. Therefore, the Peking University Faculty and Staff Union was established first, and later it contacted faculty and staff from other universities and primary and secondary schools in Beiping to form the Beiping Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Union (Mr. Ma was the secretary of the Union). At that time, the main task of this organization was to protect students. Mr. Ma said that "May Fourth" was an epoch-making day. After this movement began, the science and democracy movement itself moved towards the socialist road, and Beiping, the birthplace, became a mainstay of the student movement throughout the country. After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, it further propelled the Chinese revolution.

    Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee Member of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, this old gentleman with a long white beard, is also sixty-four years old this year. He told the reporter that during the "May Fourth" Movement, he was an older student in his third year of the Philosophy Department at Peking University, older than most students, but his thinking was not old. At that time, he was also a member of the "New Tide" magazine, which was sponsored by Peking University students. He said that the most important point of the "May Fourth" Movement was that it was the beginning of the modernization of the social movement in China. The Chinese proletariat rose up after the "May Fourth" Movement, pushing the Chinese revolution forward. At that time, there were Marxist study groups in various schools in Beiping. Today, we openly and solemnly acknowledge that China will move forward under the leadership of the Communist Party in the future.

    Qian Duansheng, Professor of the Political Science Department of Peking University, said that thirty years ago, on "May Fourth," he was a fourth-year student at Tsinghua Higher School. He participated in the "May Fourth" Movement. The burning of Zhao Jia Lou was on the afternoon of May 4th. Tsinghua students only entered the city on the 5th to put up slogans and contact the Beiping Student Union. The entire month of May was in turmoil. There were two climaxes of the May Fourth Movement in Beiping. On June 3rd, all Tsinghua students marched and propagated in the city. Many people were arrested this time. Tsinghua alone had more than twenty people, who were detained in the Science Building of Peking University, and later they were all detained in the Law Building of Peking University (now the Third Courtyard). More than a thousand people were imprisoned in total, and I was one of them. We were only welcomed back to the school by all Tsinghua students on the 8th. On June 15th, the National Student Federation was established in Shanghai, and Beiping also sent representatives such as Xu Deheng to attend.

    Finally, Mr. Qian said that, compared to young intellectuals, the leaders of the May Fourth Movement valued themselves too much, so the student movement at that time was not universal enough, today's student movement is much more solid.

    Yang Zhensheng, Professor of the Chinese Department of Peking University, said that during the May Fourth Movement, he was studying in the Chinese Department of Peking University and was about to graduate. At that time, the Chinese Literature Department was very active. Some advanced gentlemen ran "New Youth," and we students, including myself and Yu Pingbo, ran "New Tide." Many people submitted articles. The situation I remember on May Fourth was like this: on that day, more than two hundred teachers and students from Peking University gathered in what is now Democracy Square, and then everyone went to Tiananmen to hold a meeting. After the meeting, everyone went to the foreign embassies in Dongjiaominxiang to deliver a protest letter regarding the Paris Peace Conference, but they were blocked by the police. So everyone turned back to Cao Rulin's residence in Zhao Jia Lou. However, the gate was tightly closed. A student jumped over the wall first, and the gate was opened, but Cao ran away through the back door. In anger, the students discovered Zhang Zongxiang and beat him up, and smashed many things in the house. Later, they found a bucket of kerosene in the room, and everyone immediately lit it, causing the burning of Zhao Jia Lou. Twenty-nine students were arrested on the spot, and the school immediately went on strike.

    Mr. Yang also talked about the evolution of literature over the past thirty years in relation to the May Fourth Movement and the New Literature Movement. He said that the outlook on life expressed in literature at that time was mostly conciliatory, starting from the individual, and not a thorough literary revolution. Today, it has evolved into literature that serves the people, with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main content. Mr. Yang also said with emotion that he had gradually understood the importance and power of people's literature since liberation, today is a class transformation, the transformation of intellectuals is important, and he said that he is willing to learn new things.

    Yu Pingbo, Professor of the Chinese Department of Peking University, smiled when he heard that the reporter was there to interview him about the May Fourth Movement. He said that he had already written an article commemorating May Fourth. During the May Fourth Movement, Mr. Yu was studying at Peking University, and he was also a member of the New Tide Society. He said that at that time, his liberal ideas were very strong, and he was not clear about politics, but he was greatly influenced by the New Culture Movement. He believed that the May Fourth Movement was an acute revolution, but later the power of this revolutionary movement was scattered, and many figures of the May Fourth era changed their nature. However, today, when we look back, the Chinese Communist Party has actually realized the spirit of May Fourth.

    Luo Changpei, Professor of the Chinese Department of Peking University, and Yang Zhensheng, Yu Pingbo, and Xu Deheng were all classmates during the "May Fourth" era. When the reporter talked to him about the "May Fourth" Movement, he said that he was very unfortunate, as he was a day student at the time and participated very little in school activities, but he knew something about the situation in the class at that time. For example, the class ran three magazines of different natures: "New Tide," "National," and "National Heritage," all of which played a significant role at the time. Mr. Luo said, I feel that the ideas of all aspects of the "May Fourth" era were just a bud, and today, thirty years later, to use a common saying, it is adulthood, and everything has developed. Therefore, commemorating the May Fourth in liberated Beiping this year is particularly meaningful.

    The reporter also interviewed Zhou Binglin, Professor of the Law School of Peking University. Mr. Zhou said that I remember on the first night of "May Fourth," representatives from various schools went to the auditorium of the Third Courtyard of Peking University to hold a meeting to discuss the preparations for the demonstration, and decided on the May Fourth parade. Peking University students used the organization of the members of the National Magazine Society of various schools at that time to contact various colleges and universities. After gathering in Tiananmen Square on the morning of May Fourth, they prepared to parade to the embassy district, but they were blocked. Everyone decided to go to Cao Rulin's residence in Zhao Jia Lou (which is Zhao Jia Lou in Dongzongbu Hutong now). After opening the door, they did not find Cao, but beat Zhang Zongxiang severely in the garden. Later, because the house was smoking, everyone ran out. At this time, some students were arrested by the police in the house. After Mr. Xu Deheng and I walked out, Mr. Xu was arrested on the street. That night, the students who returned to school immediately held an emergency meeting to discuss rescuing the arrested students. President Cai also attended and gave a speech. The next day, all schools went on strike. This matter reached another climax on June 3rd, and a large number of students were arrested until the strike, work stoppage, and market closure were responded to in various places before they were released.

    几个“五四”时代的人物访问记
    柏生
    在“五四”运动发祥地的北平，纪念“五四”三十周年的前夕，记者特走访了几个“五四”运动时代的人物
    华北人民政府监察院于力副院长，愉快的告诉记者：“五四”运动当时，他正在北平高等师范（师大）国文系四年级读书。那时学校里有一种叫工学会的进步团体，参加者都是些半工半读的学生，于也是其中的一个。当巴黎和会解决山东问题的消息传到北平后，全国舆论大哗，北平学生的反应尤为强烈。“五四”那天，高师四分之三的同学都参加了天安门前的大会，会后以北大为首向曹汝霖宅奔去，演成历史上有名的火烧赵家楼的一幕。以后高师学生继续到街头进行宣传，曾被捕了许多人。现在华北人民政府副主席杨秀峰也是当时师大参加“五四”运动的一个史地系的学生，当时师大附中的赵世琰（一九二七年大革命中牺牲）和夏亢农（夏康农）等，许多中学生也参加了这个运动。
    于力先生摸着胡子愉快的说，三十年了，这一切还都在我的记忆中。过去我们只是空想，表现的都完全是小布尔乔亚的思想，行动是愚昧的，没有阶级的意识，而是超阶级的。今天在共产党的领导下，把一切都具体化了，青年也有了指针，有了方向，整个的中国已得到了新的发展。
    中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦，这位年高的民主老前辈今年已经六十五岁了，当他着重的谈着“五四”时代的事迹时，他说，那时我正在北大哲学系教书，“五四”运动发生后，学生们被捕的很多。这时校中没有主持人，教职员感到非组织起来不可，于是首先成立了北大的教职员联合会，后来又联系了北平其他大学及中小学的教职员组成了北平小学以上教职员联合会（马先生便是联合会的书记）当时这个组织主要的是做保护学生的工作。马先生他说“五四”是划时代的一天，从这次运动开始后，科学民主运动本身向社会主义道路前进，而发祥地的北平也成了全国各地学运的一个主干。中国共产党成立后，把中国革命更推动起来。
    中国国民党三民主义同志联合会常务委员谭平山，这位白须长长的老先生，今年也已经六十四岁了。他告诉记者，“五四”运动时，他还是北大哲学系三年级的一个老学生，年纪比一般同学都大，可是思想并不老。当时北大学生主办的“新潮”杂志，他也是社员之一。他说，“五四”最主要的一点是中国近代化的社会运动，是从“五四”开始的，中国无产阶级在“五四”运动后起来了，把中国革命向前推进了一步。那时北平各校就有马克斯小组的学习活动。今天，我们公开郑重的承认，中国今后是要在共产党的领导下向前进展的。
    北大政治系教授钱端升说，三十年前的“五四”，我正在清华高等学堂四年级读书，“五四”运动我是参加了，火烧赵家楼是五月四日下午的事，我们清华同学五五才进城的，贴标语与北平学生会联系。整个的五月都是在动荡中，五四运动当时在北平有两个高潮，六月三日清华学生全体进城游行宣传，这次被捕的人很多，光清华就有二十多人，被关在北大理科大楼里，后来又一起关到北大法科大楼（现在的三院）被监禁的一共有一千多人，我也是其中的一个，一直到八号我们才由清华全体同学迎接回校。六月十五日在上海成立全国学生联合会，北平也派代表许德珩等出席。
    最后，钱先生说，三十年来，就青年知识分子比较，五四时领导人太看重自己，因此当时学生运动搞的不够普遍，今天的学生运动要比较坚实多了。
    北大中文系教授杨振声说，五四运动时，我正在北大中文系读书，即将毕业，当时的中国文学系闹的很热烈，有些先进的先生们办“新青年”，我们学生我、俞平伯等办新潮，投稿的人很多。“五四”那天，我记得的情形是这样的，当天，北大有先生学生二百余人，在现今的民主广场集合后，大家便到天安门开会，会后大家到东交民巷外国使馆送递关于巴黎和会的抗议书，结果为警察阻止住了，大家乃折回到赵家楼曹汝霖宅，可是大门紧紧的闭上了，一个同学首先跳进墙去，门打开了，但曹从后门跑走了，同学们气愤之下发现了章宗祥，把他打了一顿，并把屋子里的东西碎了许多，后来在房里找到一桶火油，大家便立刻点了起来，造成了火烧赵家楼。当场有二十九个同学被捕，学校马上罢课了。
    杨先生并就五四运动与当时的新文学运动谈到三十年来文学的演变，他说当时文学中所表现的人生观多是调和派的，以个人为出发的，不是彻底的文学革命，而今天已经演变到以工农兵生活为主要内容的为人民服务的文学。杨先生并感慨的说，他从解放后才逐渐了解人民文学的重要和力量，今天是一个阶级的转变，知识分子的改造是重要的，他说他愿意自己能学习些新的东西。
    北大中文系教授俞平伯听了记者是来访问他关于五四的事情，他含笑的说他已作了一篇纪念五四的文章。五四爆发时，俞先生正在北大读书，他也是新潮社社员之一。他说，那时自己自由主义的思想很浓，对政治弄不清楚，但受新文化运动的影响很大。他认为五四运动是一个尖锐的革命，但后来这个革命运动的力量分散了，许多五四时代的人物都变了质。然而今天我们再来看看，中国共产党已经实际实现了五四的精神。
    北大中文系教授罗长培，他和杨振声、俞平伯，还有许德珩，他们都是“五四”时代同班的学生。当记者和他谈到“五四”运动情形时，他说他很不幸，当时是个走读生，对于学校的活动参加的很少，但对那时班里的情形他也知道一些，如班里办了三个不同性质的杂志，新潮、国民、国故，在当时都起了很大的作用。罗先生说，我感到“五四”时代各方面思想都只是一个萌芽，而今天三十年了，说句俗语，正是成年时，一切也都有了发展，因此今年在解放了的北平来纪念五四也特别有他的意义的。
    记者又访问了北大法学院教授周炳琳。周先生说，我记得“五四”头一天晚上，我们各校代表到北大三院礼堂开会，讨论示威的准备，决定了五四的游行，北大同学利用当时各校国民杂志社员的组织连络了各院校，五四早晨在天安门集会后，预备到使馆区游行，结果被阻，大家便决定到赵家楼曹汝霖住处（就是现在东总布胡同中的赵家楼），将门打开后，没找到曹，在花园里把章宗祥大打了一顿，后来因房屋冒烟，大家便都跑了出来，这时有的同学就在房里被警察逮捕，我和许德珩先生走出后，许先生又在街上被捕走了。当晚回校的同学立刻召开了一个紧急会议，讨论营救被捕同学，蔡校长也出席讲了话。第二天各校都罢了课这事到六月三日又发生了一次高潮，大批学生被捕直到各地响应罢课、罢工、罢市才释放出来。
