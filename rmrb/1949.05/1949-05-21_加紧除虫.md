Intensify Pest Control
　　He Li

　　Currently, insect plagues have been discovered in various regions. According to statistics, they have already damaged more than 260,000 mu of crops, and locusts have begun to appear. If these are not eradicated promptly and allowed to spread, they will inevitably cause a severe famine.

　　Insect plagues have occurred in North China every year. For example, aphids damaged cotton seedlings in the Taiyue region the year before last, causing a significant reduction in cotton production. Last year, grubs damaged crops, with statistics from only a portion of the materials showing a rate of 6%, and the actual situation was also very widespread. Last year, wheat seedlings in Meng County suffered great losses, and this type of insect damage has now been discovered in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. In the past, the People's Government made great efforts to eliminate these pests and diseases, saving countless fields of crops, but due to a lack of technology and inadequate medicines, suffered many losses.

　　This year, North China has completely escaped the war environment and can peacefully engage in construction. Thanks to the cultivation of agricultural cadres in recent years, farms have been established everywhere, accumulating a lot of experience. Moreover, with the liberation of major cities such as Tianjin and Beijing, the conditions for technology and medicine are much better than in the past. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture has recently issued as much as 100,000 jin of pesticides for killing pests and diseases, which can treat and save 750,000 mu of crops. If these medicines can be fully utilized, many problems can be solved. The sources of these medicines are not very difficult now. For example, grub medicine, grub water, and DDT can all be manufactured in Tianjin and Beijing. DDT, in particular, is a contact agent that also has a stomach poison effect, making it very effective. Insecticides such as "666" can also be bought from outside, which creates very favorable conditions for this year's production and construction, exceeding any previous year.

　　Of course, this does not mean that we have sufficient conditions today and everything is smooth and unobstructed; this is only the beginning of construction, and there are many difficulties that must be overcome:

　　First of all, the use of these drugs is still in its initial trial phase. Many cadres are not familiar with their performance and preparation methods, and the technology for their application must be vigorously promoted. For example, in the past, when using lime-sulfur mixture, because the concentration was not standardized and there was no specific gravity instrument for testing, some said it was effective when it happened to be right, while others said it was not only ineffective but also caused drug damage, reducing confidence. Although it is a very simple procedure, it must be researched and promoted, and explained in detail to the farmers. In the past, a promoter went among the farmers to promote the use of derris powder to kill aphids. This drug needs to be mixed with soapy water, so in addition to giving out the drug, he also gave two bars of soap. But because the principle was not explained clearly, the farmers took the soap and washed their clothes, with the result that the drug could not take effect. Moreover, some farmers often have a skeptical and resistant attitude towards this new technology before they see its effect. This all shows that the promotion of new technology is still a new issue for both cadres and farmers, and it must be vigorously promoted.

　　Secondly, we must promote practical local methods. For example, to treat aphids, although we currently have a lot of derris powder (i.e., rotenone), which is a specific drug for treating aphids, it will not be enough if it is widely popular in the vast rural areas of North China. The best way to treat this kind of insect damage in the countryside is with tobacco stem water. It is widely available and easy to implement. As long as we organize and educate the farmers well, it can also solve the problem. Another example is using the water submersion method to treat spider mites, which is also the easiest for farmers to accept. The problem today is to popularize and improve these methods, because some methods are used and familiar in area A, but not in area B, which is not used to them. This requires the government and agricultural cadres to do the publicity and popularization work. Furthermore, agricultural cadres must break with the dogmatic work ideology and not only pay attention to the things in scientific books. They should know that if the local methods in rural areas are effective, they also contain scientific principles. I think if we can analyze, refine, and manufacture tobacco stem water to replace imported rotenone, wouldn't that be even easier?

　　Thirdly, we must strengthen organizational work, because today, our manpower and material resources are still limited. Each administrative office currently has only about thirty agricultural promotion team members, which is extremely limited even when added to the local farm staff. If a certain disaster is prevalent in an area, it is very difficult to handle with only this small number of people. Therefore, in normal times, key areas should be established in areas where disasters have frequently occurred in the past, combined with research work, to establish an information network and extinguish the disaster as soon as it arises, so that it cannot spread, which can save a lot of labor. If it has already developed, the Jizhong method can be adopted to temporarily organize two or three hundred people, give them short-term training, and carry out prevention and control. Furthermore, we have very few machines. For the 100,000 jin of medicine that has been issued, 10,000 sprayers are needed to use it freely, but we currently only have 4,000 sprayers, and some are broken and cannot be used, so one sprayer has to be used for three. This also requires good organization to concentrate it in mobile places for flexible deployment.

　　In short, these difficulties should be properly resolved to make the smallest capacity generate the greatest effect.

　　加紧除虫
    贺笠
    目前虫灾已在各地发现，据统计危害庄稼已达二十六万余亩，且已出现蝗虫，如不及早扑灭，任其蔓延，必将造成严重的灾荒。
    华北的虫灾历年均曾发生，如太岳区前年蚜虫蚀害棉苗，使棉花减产很大，去年蝼蛄为害仅一部份材料统计亦占百分之六，实际情形亦很普遍。去年孟县麦苗曾遭到很大损失，现在冀鲁豫已发现这种虫害。过去人民政府对这些病虫害曾用大力扑灭，救出无数田禾，但由于技术缺乏，药物不济，受了不少的损失。
    今年华北已完全脱离战争环境，可以安心和平建设，由于几年来农业干部的培养，到处都建立了农场，积累了不少经验。加以平津等大城市的解放，技术药物条件都比过去好的多，如最近农业部已发下杀除病虫害药剂达十万斤之多，能治救农作物七十五万亩，这些药物如能得到充分运用，是可以解决不少问题。这些药物的来源现在都不太困难，如蝼蛄药、蝼蛄水、滴滴涕平津均可制造，特别滴滴涕，是接触剂也兼有胃毒剂作用效力很好。杀虫药如“六六六”亦可以从外面买来，这对于今年的生产建设都造成很大的有利条件，超过过去任何一年。
    当然这并不是说：今天已有了足够的条件，一切都是顺利无阻；而这也仅仅是建设的开头，困难正多，必须努力克服：
    首先，这些药物的使用还是初试，关于它的性能、调制法，许多干部还不熟悉，运用掌握的技术还须有力推广。如过去使用石灰硫磺剂，因为调制时浓度无一定标准，又无比重器测验，有的碰对了就说有效，有的没弄对不但不能杀虫，反而发生药害，减低了信心，虽然是一件很简单的手续，亦必须研究推广，详细告诉给农民。过去曾有过一个推广人员到农民当中去推广用地力斯粉杀蚜虫，这种药剂需用肥皂水调配，因此除发给药剂外还给了两块肥皂，但因为道理没讲清楚，农民便把肥皂拿去洗了衣服，结果使药剂亦不能发生效果，而且有些农民，当他还未看到效果的时候，对于这种新技术常带着怀疑抵抗的心理，这都说明了推广新技术，不管在干部和农民中都还是一个新问题，必须用大力推广。
    其次，是推广实用的土法。如治蚜虫，我们目前虽有不少的地力斯粉（即鱼藤粉），是治蚜虫的特效药。但由于华北农村广大，如果普遍流行也是不够用。农村里治这种虫害的最好办法是烟筋水。普遍易行，只要我们好好组织教育农民，也很解决问题。又如用水淹法治火蛛子，也是农民最易接受的，今天的问题是要把这些问题普及提高，因为有些方法是甲地有的用惯了的，乙地没有也不习惯，这就必须由政府和农业干部来做这个宣传普及工作。再就是农业干部要打破教条主义的工作思想，不要光注意科学书籍上的东西，应该知道：如果农村的土办法运用生效，那也是含有科学道理的，我想：如果我们把烟筋水加以化验提制，能够代替外来的鱼藤粉，那不是更省事吗？
    第三，要加强组织工作，因为今天不管我们的人力物力都还有限，现在的农业推广队，每一行署也不过三十来人，即加上当地农场人员，亦极有限。如果一个地区流行某一灾害时，单靠这少量的人员是很难办事的。因此，在平常时期应根据过去经常发生灾害的地区建立重点区，结合研究工作，建立情报网，当灾害一发韧即加以扑灭，使其不能蔓延，就可以节省很多劳力。如果既已发展，就可采用冀中的办法，临时组织二、三百人，加以短期训练进行防治。再就是我们的器械很少。就以现在所发下的十万斤药剂，需一万架喷雾器才能运用自如，而我们现在仅四千架，且有坏了的不能用，一架要顶三架用，这也需要好好组织，把它集中在机动的地方，灵活调用。
    总之，目前这些困难都应好好解决，要使最小的能力发生最大的效果。
