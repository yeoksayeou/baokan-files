    Jinnan Military Region Armament Repair Shop
    Creates Human-Powered Water Pump
    Pumps 370 Loads of Water per Hour
    [Jinnan Electric] The workers of the Jinnan Military Region Armament Repair Shop have created a human-powered water pump, aiming to produce twenty units during Red May. This unit was originally a military industrial enterprise, but due to the current reduction in armament repair tasks, it has shifted towards industrialization. Based on the needs of the farmers, they are manufacturing first-class agricultural implements. In March, they proposed making a human-powered water pump. Workers Wang Xinzheng, Wang Jinpo, Tian Zhengzhi, and others had previously learned the principles of water pumps while working on a certain mountain road. Based on this, they studied diligently and, after nine days, finally succeeded in developing it. Commander Wang of the military region even came to visit in person and praised their enthusiastic spirit of creation and service to the people, and personally pointed out shortcomings for improvement. Later, tests were conducted at the Na Family in Tangyang River and the Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Society, with good results, pumping more than 370 tons of water per hour, which was very popular among the farmers. After Chen Xiangkui from a certain village in the Fourth District of Longxiang saw it, he returned to the village and told the people, who immediately elected him as their representative to request a loan of ten [units], paying in wheat. They are now mass producing them to meet the needs of agricultural production.

    冀南军区修械所
    创造人摇抽水机
    一小时吸水三百七十担
    【冀南电】冀南军区修械所工人创造人摇抽水机，要在红五月赶制二十架。该能原为军工工业，因目前修械任务减少，便转向企业化。根据农民需要、制造头等农具。三月间又提出制人摇抽水机，工友王心正、王金坡、田正之等，过去在某山某路上做工时学过水泵的原理，据此，刻苦钻研，经历九日，终于配制成功，军区王司令员曾说亦亲来参观，对他们这样热心创造，为人民服务的精神备加鼓励，并亲自指点改造缺点。后来于汤阳河那家及冀南水利推进社试验，成绩良好，一小时吸水三百七十余吨，很受农民欢迎。隆乡四区某村陈相魁看了后回村一说，群众马上推他当代表，要求贷给十，麦子交粮。现正大量赶造，以应农业生产需要。
