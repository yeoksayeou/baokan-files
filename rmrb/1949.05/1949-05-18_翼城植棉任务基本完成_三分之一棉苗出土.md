　　【Taiyue Telegraph】 Yicheng County, from mid-April to May 5th (around the Beginning of Summer), has sown cotton on more than 55,000 mu (the county's cotton planting task is basically completed), and one-third of the cotton seedlings have already sprouted. The acreage sown with cotton exceeds last year by 19,000 mu. This spring, when arranging production, the county government, based on the possible cotton production conditions in Yicheng County, called for planting more cotton. In mid-April, when cotton was being sown, each district held various meetings in a timely manner to strengthen leadership in cotton planting. From April 25th to May 5th, during the tense stage of cotton planting and sowing, the government promptly issued three instructions to explain and dispel ideological concerns among the masses who feared that cotton would not sell, that planting cotton was not as profitable as planting grain, and that cotton could not be used to pay public grain. They also mobilized the masses to seize the opportunity to plant dry and spot sowing. Village Party branches and village cadres were the first to respond to these instructions and calls, and carried out in-depth publicity and explanations among the masses. For example, cadres in Xiaoshi Village, discovering that the masses were waiting for rain, separately publicized the benefits of planting dry and spot sowing, and used blackboards or primary school students to carry out publicity. Some villages also did a good job in solving the specific difficulties of the masses: cadres in Xiaping Village were responsible for coordinating seeds for the masses; Zhao Menglong, the financial and grain director of Xiaoshi Village, lent 152 jin of his own cotton seeds to six families, including Li Chengde. In particular, many Party member cadres took the lead in dry planting, which played a significant role. According to the statistics of various villages on May 5th, 75% of the villages have completed 85% of the original cotton planting plan, and some have exceeded the original plan. For example, Fancun originally planned to plant 700 mu, but now 728 mu have been planted.

　　The masses have also been more diligent in cultivating cotton fields than in previous years, and have voluntarily combined mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. The application of fertilizer in cotton fields has also exceeded last year. Zhengzhuang Village and Xiaoshi Village applied an average of eight carts (equivalent to 40 dan) of manure per mu, while @Tang Village applied an average of nine carts of manure per mu. When cotton was sown, the masses generally carried out seed selection work. This year, most of the county planted "Dayanghua" (a kind of American cotton, with long, white, and easy-to-pick fibers). For example, in Fuce Village, in the past, "Xiaoyanghua" (shorter fibers, smaller yield) was mostly planted. This year, after the masses heard the government's publicity about the benefits of "Dayanghua," they went to Shiqiao Village and the Quwo Hecao area to exchange for "Dayanghua" seeds.

　　翼城植棉任务基本完成
  　三分之一棉苗出土
    【太岳电】翼城全县自四月中旬至五月五日（立夏前后），棉花已下种五万五千余亩（全县植棉任务基本完成），现有三分之一的棉苗已经出土。下种棉花亩数超过去年一万九千亩。今春县府在布置生产时，就根据翼城全县产棉的可能条件，号召多种棉花。四月中旬棉花下种时，各区又适时的召开了各种会议，加强种棉领导。四月二十五日到五月五日正当植棉播种紧张阶段，政府又及时根据群众怕种棉没销路，种花不如种粮利大，棉花不能抵交公粮等思想顾虑，先后发出三次指示作了解释，并动员群众抓紧寄种（干种）、点种。各村支部及村干部首先响应了这些指示和号召，并分别在群众中进行了深入的宣传解释。如晓史村干部发现群众有等雨思想，就分头向群众宣传寄种和点种的好处，并利用黑板报或通过小学生进行宣传。在解决群众具体困难上，有的村也作的很好：下坪村干部负责给群众调剂了种籽；晓史村财粮主任赵梦龙，把自己的棉花籽借给李成德等六家一百五十二斤。特别是不少党员干部带头进行寄种，起了很大作用。据五月五日各村的统计，已有百分之七十五的村子，完成原种花计划的百分之八十五，有的已超过了原计划。如范村原计划种七百亩，现已种上七百二十八亩。
    群众在棉田的耕作上，也比往年加工，自愿结合互助解决了劳、畜力的困难。在棉田的施肥上也超过了去年。郑庄村、晓史村，每亩地平均上到八车（合四十担）粪，＠唐村每亩地平均上粪九车。棉花下种时，群众还普遍进行了花籽选种工作，今年全县大部都种的“大洋花”（美国棉的一种，绒长、白、好摘）如符册村，过去多种“小洋花”（绒较短、产量小）今年群众听到政府宣传“大洋花”的好处，便分头到石桥村、曲沃河漕一带换成“大洋花”种。
