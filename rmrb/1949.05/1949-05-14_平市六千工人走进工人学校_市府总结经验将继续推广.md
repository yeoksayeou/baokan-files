    Six Thousand Workers in Beiping Enter Workers’ Schools
    Municipal Government Summarizes Experience for Continued Promotion
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Since mid-March, when the various districts of Beiping began organizing worker study groups (excluding those for workers in public enterprises), these have developed from study groups into classes, and then expanded into schools. To date, the city has a total of eighty worker schools and study classes, and ninety-four study groups, with 6,395 students. After more than fifty days of exploration, initial achievements and experience have been gained in areas such as mass mobilization, organization, teaching materials, teaching methods, and leadership. The 10th District has done particularly well, because it has always been closely linked to the workers' immediate concerns. For example, it has developed suitable teaching materials and methods based on the workers' needs, and regularly helped workers solve their difficulties. As a result, the school has established credibility among the workers. To this end, the Social Education Section of the Beiping Municipal People's Government Education Bureau convened a joint meeting of the heads of the Culture and Education Sections of the various districts at the Municipal Government at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th. Representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, and the North China People's Government participated to summarize the worker education work of this period. The preliminary experience is: 1. When mobilizing workers to participate in learning, it is necessary to go deep into the factories, first become familiar with the workers, and help solve some of the difficulties in their work and life, and establish credibility; then mobilize them to learn. 2. Classes should be divided according to the workers' level of education, different industries, age, and gender. 3. The teaching materials should be suitable for the workers' needs and related to their immediate interests. Generally speaking, child laborers and apprentices especially like singing and literacy, while older workers like to listen to lectures on various policies, stories of revolutionary leaders, and the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army. The political teaching materials currently used include "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy," in addition to various policies. 4. In terms of teaching methods, a combination of large classes and group discussions is used, and practical examples are used to illustrate various guidelines and policies, which workers like most and are easiest to understand. 5. Regarding teachers, political lessons must be taught by district and street cadres themselves, while cultural lessons can be taught by workers or students with higher levels of education. If workers serve as teachers, their families should be subsidized. The joint meeting discussed the existing shortcomings. In some districts, in addition to the Culture and Education Section, the Trade Union Committee and the District Party Committee Propaganda Department still do not pay enough attention to worker education. In the future, the Party, the government, and the trade union must cooperate well to lead the learning. Secondly, some teachers do not have enough contact with workers and work groups, and work on their own. The meeting pointed out: In the future, the focus of worker schools should be to consolidate one or two study classes or groups on the existing basis, accumulate experience, and then extend it to others, so that worker schools can be more consolidated.

    平市六千工人走进工人学校
    市府总结经验将继续推广
    【本报讯】平市各区自三月中旬开始组织工人学习班（公营企业工人学习不在内）以来，由学习小组发展为班，并扩大为学校。迄今全市共有工人学校和学习班八十个，学习小组九十四个，学生六千三百九十五人。经过五十多天摸索，已在动员群众、组织、教材、教法和领导等方面取得初步成绩与经济。其中以第十区办得较好。因为该区始终和工人的切身问题密切地联系着。如根据工人的要求订出适合的教材和教法，并经常帮助工人解决困难。因此，学校在工人中建立了威信。北平市人民政府教育局社教科为此于十二日上午十时在市府召开各区文教科长联席会议，市总工会、市委宣传部和华北人民政府的代表参加，总结这一时期工人教育工作。初步经验是：一、动员工人参加学习时，必须深入工厂，先与工人熟悉，并帮助解决工作生活中一些困难，建立威信；然后再动员其学习。二、要按工人的文化高低、不同的行业、年龄和性别等划分班次。三、教材要适合工人的要求，并且和工人的切身利益有关。一般说，童工和学徒特别喜欢歌咏和认字，年龄较大的则喜欢听讲各种政策，及革命领袖的故事、解放军的英勇事迹等。现在所用的政治教材，除各种政策外，有“中国革命与中国共产党”，“新民主主义论”等。四、教学方法上，大课与小组讨论结合，用实际的例子来说明各种方针与政策，工人最欢喜也最容易懂。五、教员问题，政治课须由区街干部自己讲授，文化课可以由文化程度较高的工人或学生来担任。如工人担任教员，对其家庭应给予补助。联席会上言讨现存的缺点，有些区除文教科以外，工委会、区委宣传部仍不大重视工人教育，今后必须党、政、工会好好配合起来领导学习。其次有些教员、工人和工作组的联系不够，独自搞。会上指出：今后工人学校的重心工作，是在现有的基础上，有重点的搞好一、二个学习班或小组，吸取经验，再推及其他。使工人学校更能巩固起来。      （超祺）
