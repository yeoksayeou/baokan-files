    工商业均须申请登记
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府于今（三）日发出工商字第一号通告，原文如下：为了给工商业以方向指导，减少生产与贸易之无政状态府而利生产之恢复与发展，决定全市公私营工商业进行普遍登记。凡本市已开设之私营工商业，不论曾否在伪社会局领过营业证与曾否加入过行业公会，均须向本府工商局申请登记。为各厂商登记手续方便，特规定申请书及报告表，均由各该业同业公会转发转报，并由工商局派员与各该同业公会之负责人共同组成审核小组，进行初步审查，经工商局审查批准后，颁发新证，并将伪社会局所发营业登记证或许可证收缴作废。此项登记是分行业分期办理，先办理工业，后办理商业，决定第一期自五月五日开始，先登记机器业、金属品冶制业、织染业及针织业。
