Three Words and Two Phrases

　　Turning Parasites into Productive Forces
    Transforming urban beggars is one of the wise and significant measures of the People's Government. Beggars are the result of the old society's flawed system and evil rule. Rescuing them from their miserable living conditions means finding ways to give them opportunities to engage in production and support themselves. A small number of professional beggars, with deeply ingrained habits, must also be forced to participate in production. This will not only unleash productive forces, turning society's parasites into society's productive forces and increasing social wealth, but also rectify urban order and improve public security. It is hoped that all cities in North China will vigorously implement this sound social policy, so that the people's cities will gradually achieve a state where everyone has something to do and everyone has food to eat.

　　使寄生者变成生产力
    改造城市乞丐，是人民政府贤明而重大的措施之一。乞丐是旧社会不良制度罪恶统治的结果，把他们从悲惨生活境遇里挽救出来，就是设法使其有机会从事生产，自食其力。少数职业乞丐，积习已深的，亦必须强制其参加生产。这样，既可发挥生产力量，使社会的寄生者变成社会的生产力，增加社会财富；又可整肃城市秩序，改进治安工作。希望华北各城市大力贯彻这一良好的社会政策，使人民的城市逐渐作到人人有事作，人人有饭吃。
