    The 30th Anniversary of the "Voluntary Labor on Rest Days Movement"
  　Soviet Newspapers Write Articles Commemorating

    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th】 Moscow, 10th: Newspapers here unanimously commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Soviet workers' launch of the "Voluntary Labor on Rest Days Movement." The Soviet Trade Union's newspaper, "Labor Daily," stated in its editorial: Thirty years ago, despite the difficulties in working conditions and food shortages caused by imperialist intervention and civil war, the workers still launched the "Voluntary Labor on Rest Days Movement" for the benefit of the country. They selflessly engaged in voluntary labor outside of the prescribed working hours, increasing labor productivity by two times. The editorial pointed out: "The Voluntary Labor on Rest Days Movement" has great importance; it marked a turning point in an era, demonstrating for the first time the concern of the working masses for improving labor productivity. The editorial concluded: "The Voluntary Labor on Rest Days Movement," this germ of a new labor attitude, is also the first germ of communism, which has now developed into a nationwide socialist emulation movement, which has become a method of building socialism.

    “休息日义务劳动运动”卅周年
  　苏联各报撰文纪念
    【新华社北平十四日电】莫斯科十日讯：此间各报都一致纪念苏联工人发动“休息日义务劳动运动”的三十周年纪念。苏联职工会机关报劳动报社论写道：三十年前，尽管帝国主义的干涉和内战造成了工作条件的困难和粮食缺乏，但是工人们为了国家的利益，仍然发动了“休息日义务劳动运动”，他们在规定的工作时间之外，忘我地进行义务劳动，使劳动生产率提高了两倍。社论指出：“休息日义务劳动运动”有巨大的重要性，它标志着一个划时代的转折点，第一次表现出工人群众对提高劳动生产率的关心。社论最后说：“休息日义务劳动运动”这个新劳动态度的萌芽，也是共产主义的第一个萌芽，现在已经发展成长为全国性的社会主义竞赛运动，这种竞赛已经成为建设社会主义的方法。
