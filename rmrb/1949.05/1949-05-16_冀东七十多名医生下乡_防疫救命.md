　　[Eastern Hebei Dispatch] Due to the lack of snow last winter and the drought this spring in eastern Hebei, coupled with the failure to pay attention to public health work among the masses, various infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles have been discovered in many areas. As of now, the areas where infectious diseases have been discovered include: "Qian'an, Qianxi, Luanxian, Luannan, Funing, and Linyu in the 12th District; Sanhe, Jixian, Tongxian, Pinggu, Miyun, and Shunyi in the 14th District; and Yutian, Baodi, and Xianghe in the 15th District, totaling fifteen counties. Among them, Sanhe County is the most serious, with a total of 1,503 people in the county infected with smallpox and measles, the vast majority of whom are children; in addition, 65 people have died from diseases such as diphtheria and relapsing fever. Party committees and governments at all levels attach great importance to eradicating the epidemic and have successively organized forces to launch a sudden attack on the epidemic, launching an anti-epidemic and life-saving campaign. The Health Work Team of the North China People's Government, which arrived in eastern Hebei on the 26th of last month, has gone to Sanhe, Tongxian and other places to assist local governments in providing emergency assistance. The district party committee and the commissioner's office of the 12th and 14th Districts held an emergency health and epidemic prevention meeting to discuss rescue measures and dispatched medical teams to the epidemic areas to carry out emergency prevention and treatment. All counties have also held doctor symposiums, and some have also organized health and epidemic prevention committees to mobilize and organize all Chinese and Western medicine doctors to participate in this emergency epidemic eradication work. Currently, there are fifteen medical teams in the entire 14th District (except Jixian), plus one team from the Health Work Team of the North China People's Government, a total of more than seventy medical personnel are engaged in rescue work in various counties.

　　冀东七十多名医生下乡
  　防疫救命
    【冀东电】冀东各地由于去冬少雪，今春缺雨气候干燥，加以群众卫生工作未能注意开展，不少地区先后发现天花、麻疹等各种传染病。截至目前已发现传染病的地区计有：“十二分区迁安、迁西、滦县、滦南、抚宁、临榆；十四分区三河、蓟县、通县、平谷、密云、顺义；十五分区玉田、宝坻、香河等十五个县份。其中以三河县较为严重，全县统计患染天花、麻疹者已达一千五百零三人，其中绝大部分是儿童；另患白喉、回归热等病死亡者达六十五人。各级党委及政府对扑灭瘟疫均极重视，并已先后组织力量突击灭疫，展开防疫救死运动。上月二十六日到达冀东的华北人民政府卫生工作队，已分赴三河、通县等地协助当地政府进行急救。十二、十四雨分区地委、专署，曾召开紧急卫生防疫会议，商讨抢救办法，派遣医疗小组赴疫区进行紧急防治。各县也都召开医生座谈会，有的还组织了卫生防疫委员会，把所有中西医生都发动和组织起来参加此一紧急灭疫工作。现十四分区全区（除蓟县外）共有十五个医疗小组，加上华北人民政府卫生工作队一个小组，共有七十多名医务人员在各县从事抢救工作。
