　　Polish Two Peasant Parties to Merge
  　Strengthening Close Cooperation with the United Workers' Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd] According to a Polish press agency report: The Supreme Committee of the Polish Peasant Party held a three-day meeting in Warsaw from the 17th to the 19th, making ideological and organizational preparations for the cooperation between the Polish Peasant Party and the Peasant Party, preparing for the unification of the two peasant political parties; close cooperation with the United Workers' Party, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance; and active support for government policies. The meeting reviewed the list of members before the unification with the Peasant Party. The meeting made a detailed review of the achievements and mistakes of the party in the past, and passed a resolution stating that only the rule of the working people based on the worker-peasant alliance can eliminate the backwardness and misfortune of the peasant masses. We continued the radical tendencies in the peasant movement and formed the left wing of the Polish Peasant Party in the struggle against Mikolajczyk's betrayal for the birth of the Polish Peasant Party. The nationalist tendencies in the peasant movement are a direct continuation of past mistakes. By abandoning the policies of the right-wing Polish Peasant Party and adopting the stance of the people's democratic principles, we have moved closer to unification with our sister party, the Peasant Party.

　　波两农民党将合并
  　加强与统一工人党亲密合作
    【新华社北平二十三日电】据波兰通讯社报道：波兰农民党最高委员会于十七日至十九日在华沙举行了三天的会议，在思想上与组织上为波兰农民党与农民党的合作工作进行准备。除波兰农民党最高委员会委员和执委会委员之外，还有来自各省的该党干部参加。会议批准了执委会的活动，特别是与农民党的合并，准备两个农民政党的统一；和统一工人党的亲密合作，巩固工农联盟；对政府政策的积极支持等。会议审查了与农民党统一以前党员的名单。会议对于该党过去时期的成就与错误，作了详尽的检讨，并通过决议说：只有基于工农联盟的劳动人民的统治，才能消除农民群众的落后与不幸。我们继续了农民运动中的激进倾向，为了波兰农民党的产生，在反对米科拉兹柯的叛国斗争中组成了波兰农民党的左翼。农民运动中的民族主义倾向是过去错误的直接继续。由于放充右翼波兰农民党的政策和采取了人民民主原则的立场，使我们更接近于与姊妹党农民党的统一。
