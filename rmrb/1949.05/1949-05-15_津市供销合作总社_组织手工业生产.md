    Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters
    Organizes Handicraft Production
    (Tianjin Electric Dispatch) The cooperative business in Tianjin has made considerable progress in the past month and a half. Before March 25th, the city had only over 60,000 cooperative members, but by May 5th, the number had increased to over 356,000 members in 224 cooperatives (including seven handicraft production cooperatives, and the rest being consumer cooperatives). In April, these cooperatives sold a large quantity of food and daily necessities at low prices, saving members over 44 million RMB. However, there are some shortcomings in these cooperatives. For example, speculators use the name of the cooperative to evade donations and taxes and engage in profit-making activities, or the organization is not solid enough, and the cadres' concept of serving the masses is not clear enough. Therefore, the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters has decided to suspend the development of urban consumer cooperatives. The consumer cooperatives that have already been organized will undergo a comprehensive inspection to consolidate and improve them. However, handicraft production occupies a considerable position in the national economy. Therefore, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters has decided to focus on organizing handicraft supply and marketing cooperatives starting this month. In terms of organization, it will be combined with the production of large factories in the machine industry, such as manufacturing, processing, and finishing. In terms of supply and marketing, it is determined to open up urban-rural relations and long-distance supply and marketing operations, avoiding intermediate exploitation and restrictions imposed by local trading. Close contact can be maintained with cooperatives in various friendly districts through regular delivery of goods and barter. The cooperative is also preparing to establish farmer hostels and cooperative warehouses to facilitate material exchange. An in-depth investigation will be conducted on import and export work to serve as the basis for organizing production.

    津市供销合作总社
    组织手工业生产
    【天津电】津市合作事业一个半月来，曾有长足发展。三月二十五日以前全市合作社员仅六万余人，但至五月五日则增至三十五万六千余人，二百二十四个合作社（其中七个手工业生产社，余均为消费合作社）。这些合作社在四月份中，曾以低价售出大批食粮与日用品，为社员节省了四千四百余万元人民券。但是在这些合作社中，却存在着一些缺点。如投机分子利用合作社名义，逃避捐税，进行营利，或组织尚不够巩固，干部为群众服务的观点也不够明确等，因此，津市供销合作总社已决定暂停发展市民消费合作社。已组织起来的消费合作社，则将进行全面的检查，以便巩固与提高。唯手工业生产，在国民经济中占有相当地位。因此，供销合作总社，决定自本月份起着重组织手工业供销合作社。在组织上，则与机器工业大工厂生产相结合，如制造、加工、整理等。在供销上，决打通城乡关系和远距离的供销经营，避免中间剥削及就地买卖所受之限制。对各友区合作社，可采取定期交货，物物交换等方式密切联系。该社并准备建立农民招待所，成立合作货栈，以利物资交换。对出入口工作将作深入的调查，以为组织生产的根据。
