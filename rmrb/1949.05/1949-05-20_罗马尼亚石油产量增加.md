　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th. TASS Bucharest: The petroleum industry, a major sector of the Romanian economy, has achieved significant success. In 1948, the industry was nationalized, and its oil production increased by 16% compared to 1947. This year's plan calls for a further increase in production by 15%. Basic construction projects in the oil fields will double this year compared to 1948. Great attention has been paid to exploration and mining work, accounting for about 50% of development work, compared to only 19% in 1947. The development of Romania's petroleum industry has received technical assistance from the Soviet Union, which has supplied equipment and provided transportation and other conveniences. The great changes in the lives of Romanian oil workers have played a significant role in accelerating the development of the petroleum industry. The living standards of workers have been greatly improved, and a large number of canteens, various public utilities, clubs, libraries, cinemas, and theaters have been established. New wage regulations have increased the base wage by 10% to 12%, a bonus system has been implemented, and the average income of oil workers has increased by 30%. The competition to increase labor productivity has been widely expanded in the oil fields.
