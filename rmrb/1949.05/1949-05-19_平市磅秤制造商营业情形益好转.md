　　The Business of Scales Manufacturers in Beiping is Improving
    [This Newspaper's Report] There are five private machine factories in the city that specialize in manufacturing scales and measuring instruments: Jinshengxiang, Shui Shang Foreign Firm, Yongxin Firm, Xinxinglong, and Zhengchang. All factories quickly resumed work after the liberation of Beiping, and their business has been improving daily. For example, Jinshengxiang Factory sold a total of more than 30 large and small scales last year, while in the three to four months after liberation, they sold 27 scales. Shui Shang Foreign Firm produced an average of only two units per month last year, but in the three and a half months after liberation, they produced 30 units and repaired 50 units. The business of other factories has also improved. Various institutions, large factories, grain depots, coal yards, and railway stations in various places all feel the need for scales. According to the machine performance of each factory, they can produce 150 units per month. As railway transportation in various places is rapidly recovering, there will be no problem with sales in the future.
    In addition, Jinshengxiang Factory can manufacture balances and repair balances, and Shui Shang Foreign Firm can manufacture balances and physics instruments (mechanics and thermodynamics instruments in middle school physics laboratories). Schools and institutions in this city and other places have already placed orders. (Ming)

　　平市磅秤制造商营业情形益好转
    【本报讯】本市专门制造磅秤度量衡器具的私营机器工厂计有金生祥、水上洋行、永信商行、信兴隆及正昌五家。各厂在北平解放后即迅速复工，营业情形日见好转，譬如金生祥工厂去年全年共销出大小磅秤三十余台，解放后仅三、四两个月就销出二十七台。水上洋行去年每月平均仅生产两台，解放后三个半月内就生产了三十台，修理了五十台。其余各厂营业情形亦好转，各机关、大工厂、粮栈、煤栈及各地车站对磅秤均感需要。根据各厂机器性能，每月可生产一百五十台，现各地铁路交通正迅速恢复中，将来销路绝无问题。
    又，金生祥工厂能制造天平及修理天平，水上洋行能制造天平及物理仪器（中学物理实验室中的力学热学仪器），本市学校及外地学校、机关已有前来订货者。（鸣）
