    Attempt to Mediate Civil Disputes as Much as Possible
    Ping City People's Court Establishes Mediation Work Group
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to establish close ties with the judicial sections of the district governments of Ping City and establish a leading working relationship, the Ping City People's Court convened a judicial conference yesterday (the 29th) with the heads of the judicial sections of each district. It was decided that the court will establish a mediation work group to directly lead the mediation work in each district and resolve the difficulties encountered in the mediation of cases in each district. It was decided that various civil and minor criminal cases should be resolved through mediation by the district governments as much as possible in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the court. However, the districts will only do mediation work and not conduct trials. If it is necessary for a district to detain a criminal, it must first request approval from the court before detaining the criminal on behalf of the court. Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing People's Court, pointed out in his speech at the meeting: In the future, the court should conduct judicial work with each district in an organized and led manner. Establish a leadership relationship in work. Each district can contact the mediation work group at any time by telephone to solve problems, and establish a weekly notification system. The mediation of disputes should be based on the spirit of the "Decision on Mediation and Resolution of Civil Disputes" of the North China People's Government. For disputes in which district mediation fails, the working group can also go directly to the district to help mediate or conduct trials.

    民间纠纷尽量调解
    平市人民法院设调解工作组
    【本报讯】北平市人民法院为了与平市各区政府司法科取得密切联系，建立工作上的领导关系，于昨（二十九）日召集各区司法科负责人举行司法会议，决定由法院成立调解工作组，直接领导各区的调解工作，解决各区调解案件时所遭遇的困难问题。决定各种民事以及轻微的刑事案件尽量由区政府调解解决，以减少法院的积压案件。但各区只做调解工作，不作审判工作。各区有必要扣押刑事人犯时，须先请示法院批准，再代法院扣押人犯。北平人民法院王斐然院长在会上讲话时指出：今后法院应和各区有组织有领导的进行司法工作。确立工作上的领导关系，各区可以随时用电话和调解工作组联系解决问题，并建立每周通报制度。调解纠纷应根据华北人民政府“关于民间纠纷调解决定”的精神去作。对区调解不成立的纠纷，工作组还可以直接到区去帮助解调或进行审判。
