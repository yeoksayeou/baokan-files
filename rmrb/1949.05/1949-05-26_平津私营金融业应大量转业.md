　　Private Financial Industry in Pingjin Should Massively Change Professions
　　Qian Jiaju
　　According to statistics, there are currently forty private banks in Tianjin (including six foreign banks and three jointly operated by government and private capital), one hundred and eleven native banks, totaling one hundred and fifty-one; and sixty-nine native banks in Beiping, totaling two hundred and twenty. In addition, Tianjin has one hundred and ten securities firms, one hundred and fifty gold shops, and forty-eight insurance companies. If we add up the banks and native banks in Beiping and Tianjin, together with gold shops and insurance companies, there will be more than six hundred financial enterprises. At present, except for securities firms which have not officially resumed business, and only a few insurance companies are operating, most of the others have opened. In total, there are about three to four hundred.
　　Do Pingjin need so many financial institutions to regulate social funds? We believe absolutely not. To be honest, financial business in Pingjin has been quite slack since liberation. Although it cannot be said to be "desolate," it is a fact that most are living off their past capital. The reason for this is actually very simple: first, the main sources of deposits for banks and native banks in the past were nothing more than deposits from government agencies and state-owned enterprises, interbank lending and overdrafts from national banks and bureaus, remittances, and transactions with Shanghai or other banks. As for loans, of course, the vast majority were commercial loans, with high interest rates and short terms, or for speculation and profiteering, hoarding and speculation, and buying and selling gold and silver. The situation is completely different after liberation. Deposits from government agencies and state-owned enterprises are now entirely managed by the People's Bank of China and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and private banks and native banks are no longer allowed to accept them. As for remittances and transactions with Shanghai and other places, due to the lack of smooth transportation and remittances, and the Kuomintang reactionaries' prohibition of postal, remittance, and shipping services, they have also been greatly restricted. Therefore, the current sources of deposits for private banks and native banks are very narrow. At present, the largest commercial banks in Tianjin have deposits of no more than sixty to seventy million yuan, while the smaller ones have only several million yuan, or even less. The total deposit balance of commercial banks in Tianjin at the end of April was only over 500 million yuan, and in Beiping it was only over 100 million yuan. Converted into pre-war currency values or silver dollars, this is really pitiful. Banks are institutions for credit granting and receiving. How can they do business without deposits? As for loans, naturally, there is no point in even talking about them! The interest rates on deposits absorbed by banks are mostly above 15% or even 20%. How can industrial profits be so high? After they absorb such high-interest deposits, it is naturally impossible to lend them to legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. Therefore, apart from lending to commercial usurers or engaging in speculation and profiteering, there is no other way out (of course, we are referring here to banks with improper business practices. Banks with proper business practices and established credit can still absorb some social idle funds, lend to industrial and commercial enterprises, and regulate social funds. This is still necessary today).
    We have always believed that the People's Government should ban such improper banks. Even if they are not banned, they will inevitably be eliminated naturally under the New Democracy! The People's Government certainly wants to support the development of private industry and commerce, but it will never allow the existence of speculative and profiteering commerce; similarly, under the New Democratic financial policy, it should never allow the continued existence of such banks and native banks with abnormal business practices. We can say that one-third of the banks and native banks in Pingjin are enough to meet the needs of society! The remaining two-thirds will be naturally eliminated. It can be pointed out that such small banks or speculative financial industries have absolutely no future under the New Democratic system. Rather than sitting idle and waiting to deplete their old capital, it is better to change professions or trades as soon as possible. If they want to wait for an opportunity to relive their old golden dreams in the speculative market, they are completely wrong! The new government's laws will never allow them to do so, and the new environment will not allow them to do so either.
    For the sake of the sound development of the Pingjin economy, and for the sake of the future of the various banks, these small banks should change professions as early as possible. While the old capital has not yet been depleted, they should use the remaining capital to engage in other productive undertakings. I firmly believe that the People's Government is happy to assist them in changing professions. Generally speaking, the employees in the financial industry have a relatively high cultural level, and they are quite knowledgeable in managing industrial and commercial enterprises, so it is relatively easy to change professions. As for commercial banks with normal business and legitimate operations, they certainly still have their place. However, some large banks employ too many staff. As far as I know, a certain large commercial bank in Tianjin has more than two hundred employees, while the total amount of deposits is only sixty to seventy million yuan in People's currency. However, another small bank, with deposits only half as much as the former, employs only twenty employees. In this case, the large bank is naturally unable to make ends meet and cannot avoid losses! According to current observations, it is unlikely that commercial banks will make great progress in their business in the short term. Therefore, we hope that large commercial banks should also consider reducing their staff and helping them change professions. In other words, they have to lower their standards, which can save expenses and allow them to fight a protracted war. I wonder what the authorities of the commercial banks think?

　　平津私营金融业应大量转业
    千家驹
    据统计，天津现有私营银行四十家（包括外商六家，官商合办三家），钱庄一百一十一家，共一百五十一家，北平行庄共计六十九家，以上共二百二十家。此外，天津有证券行一百一十家，金店一百五十家，保险业四十八家，我们如把北平、天津两地的银行钱庄连同金店、保险业合计起来，金融企业将在六百家以上，现在除证券行尚未正式复业，保险公司仅少数营业，其他大部多已开业，总计约有三、四百家。
    平津两地是不是需要这么多的金融机构来调剂社会资金呢？我们认为绝对不需要。老实说，平津自解放以后的金融业务是够清淡的。虽不能说“门可罗雀”，但大多数在吃老本却是事实。这原因本来也是十分简单的：第一、过去银行钱庄的主要存款来源不外政府机关及公营企业的存款，国家行局的拆放透支，汇出汇款，及上海或其他行庄的往来。至于放款，那当然绝大多数是商业放款，利息高，期限短，或者做投机倒把，囤积居奇，卖买金钞。解放以后情形完全不同了，政府机关及公营企业的存款已完全归中国人民银行及中、交两行所经营，私营银钱业不得再行接受，至于汇兑及上海各地的往来，因交通及汇兑还没有畅通，国民党反动派又禁止通邮通汇通航，也受了很大的限制。因此，目前私营银钱业的存款来源是很窄的，现在天津最大的商业行庄，存款数额多的不过六七千万元，少的仅数百万元，甚或不到此数。天津商业行庄存款余额在四月底总计不过五亿多元，北平不过一亿多元，这合成战前币值或银元来，实在是可怜得很。银行本为信用之受授机关，没有存款，怎么能做生意呢？至于放款，自然也谈不到了！银行所吸收来的存款利息大多在十五分以上以至二十多分，工业利润哪有这么高呢？他们把这样高利息的存款吸收了来，自然不可能贷放给正当的工商业的，于是除了投放于商业高利贷，或从事投机倒把之外，就没有别的出路了（自然，我们这里所说的是业务不正当的行庄，业务正当信用昭著的银行他们仍可吸收社会一部分游资，放款工商业，调剂社会资金，这在今天是依然必要的。）
    我们始终认为，这类不正当的行庄，人民政府是应该加以取缔的，即令不取缔的话，在新民主主义之下，也非自然淘汰不可！人民政府固然要扶植私营工商业的发展，但决不会容许投机倒把、囤积居奇的商业存在；同样地，在新民主主义的金融政策之下，也决不应该容许这类业务不正常的银行钱庄之继续存在。我们可以说一句，平津两地，有三分之一的行庄便已经是够适应社会的需求了！其余三分之二的行庄是会自然淘汰的。可以指出：这类小行庄或投机倒把的金融业在新民主主义体系下，是决计没有前途的。他们与其坐吃山空，等到把老本吃光，倒不如早日转业或改行的好。他们如果想等待时机，在投机市场上重温其旧日的黄金之梦，那就完全想错了！新政府的法令决不会容许他们这样做，而且新的环境也不容许他们这样做的。
    为了平津经济的健全发展着想，为了各行庄自身的前途着想，这些小行庄都还是及早转业的好，趁今天老本还没有吃光，利用剩余的资本，改营别的生产事业。我深信，人民政府是乐于协助他们改业的。金融业的从业员一般的说文化水准都比较高，他们在经营工商业上相当内行，改业起来是比较容易的。至于业务正常、经营合法的商业银行，当然仍有他们的地位。但有些大行庄聘用的职员，也未免太多了些。据我所知道，天津某大商业银行的职员有二百多人，而存款总额不过人民券六七千万元，但另一家小的银行，存款数额比前一家不过少一半，而所用员工仅二十余人。这样一来，大银行自然是入不敷出，不能不亏本了！据目前观察，商业银行在业务上要有大的进展，恐怕在短期内尚不可能，所以我们希望大的商业行庄也应该酌量减少员工，同时帮助员工转业。也就是说，他们要把架子放下来，这样可以撙节开支，可以持久作战，不知商业行庄的当局以为如何？
