　　Before the war, the gunny sack handicraft industry in Jincheng City had 22 businesses and 72 workers, producing more than 4,400 sacks annually. Sales were common throughout Shangdang counties. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the industry was damaged by the enemy and sales routes were cut off, leaving only three to five businesses selling locally. Since the liberation of the county in 1945, due to the urgent needs of the masses and large-scale purchases by public production organs, although sales in other areas have not been opened up, large quantities can be sold locally. By last year, the industry had grown to 34 businesses, but in this situation of supply falling short of demand, the quality of the sacks gradually declined. This year, because most of the local people already have sacks to use, and public transportation purchases have decreased, sales have become a major problem. Those who make sacks have very little capital, leading the gunny industry to decline, and businesses no longer train apprentices, making improving technology even more out of the question. In order to develop urban handicrafts, the Jincheng City Government organized a gunny sack cooperative on April 29 and provided 300,000 yuan in loans from the bank to support it. People have now been sent out to buy wool, preparing to lend the wool to each household for spinning and weaving, or the cooperative will exchange wool for sacks, and then sell them to various places, so that all 34 households will not stop working.

　　帮助销售供给原料
  　晋城扶植毛连袋业
    【太岳电】晋城市的毛连袋手工业，战前有二十二家，七十二个工人，年产四千四百多条口袋。销售普遍上党各县，抗战期间，因敌人破坏，销路隔绝，只剩三五家在本地销售。该县自一九四五年解放后到现在，由于群众的迫切需要与公营生产机关的大批购买，所以外地销路虽未打开，只在本地即可大批出售，到去年已发展到三十四家，但在这种供不应求的情况下，口袋质量就逐渐降低；到今年因本地群众已大部有口袋使用，公家运输购买的也少了，因此销路大成问题。这些做口袋的又都是本钱很少，遂使毛连业自流起来，各家也不再培养学徒了，提高技术更谈不到。晋城市政府为发展城市手工业，于四月二十九日组织毛连业合作社，银行以三十万元贷款扶植。现已派人出去买毛，准备把毛贷给各户纺织，或合作社以毛换口袋，然后向各地销售，使三十四户全不停工。
