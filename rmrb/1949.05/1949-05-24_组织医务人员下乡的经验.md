Experiences in Organizing Medical Personnel to Go to the Countryside
　　Zhu Kun

After the liberation of Beiping, the Military Control Commission's Health Department advertised to register scattered and unemployed medical personnel. From March 7th to early April, a total of about 570 people registered. Among them were 194 doctors, assistant doctors, and interns of various specialties; 61 pharmacy personnel; over 240 midwives, nurses, assistants, and technicians; 47 veterinarians; and 2 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.

Looking at the sources of these people, most of them had gathered here from other regions (mainly Northeast, Shandong, and Shanxi), some were military doctors from the former Kuomintang army who had deserted the army and fled to the city before and after liberation, another part were female medical personnel who had not worked for many years (mostly due to marriage, childbirth, family matters, etc.), and there were also some with low technical skills who could not find work.

After registration, about 360 people were assigned to various work posts based on their abilities: 157 in the North China region, 11 in the Beiping urban area, 65 in various departments going south, 40 professors and teachers in the Northwest liberated area, 18 in the Bohai Military Region, and 68 doctors were introduced to various hospitals for internships before being assigned work. In addition to those who have found their own jobs, more than 150 people are still waiting for work due to various limitations.

In this work, we feel that there are the following issues:

Entering a newly liberated city, it is first possible to organize such a group of unemployed medical personnel to go to the countryside and other work posts.

Distinguish them during registration, understand their technical level, clarify what kind of work they can undertake, and which region they are willing to work in, so as to make a reasonable allocation.

Based on experience, it is best to study for a short period after registration before assigning them. Training classes or seminars can be used. The main purpose is to make them understand our policies (especially to clear up some wrong perceptions and fears about the liberated areas), recognize the development of the international and domestic situation, the prospect of revolutionary victory, and some basic revolutionary theories, and the concept of serving the people. In addition, it is also necessary to introduce the medical work in the liberated areas, the learning and improvement of medical personnel's skills, and practical examples of combining with workers and peasants, as well as solving other ideological concerns, such as the issue of living conditions, the fear of hardship, the inability to do anything without equipment... and so on. For example, in a certain training class, there was an initial mobilization of some people to go to Shijiazhuang. A doctor surnamed Wang told others: "If you ask me to go, I will die rather than go." But after studying, he went to work in the Bohai region without hesitation. Another nursing assistant surnamed Liu always asked to be sent near Beiping, fearing to leave home, but after studying (also influenced by the army crossing the Yangtze River), she voluntarily joined the southward work team. Therefore, we believe that through this short-term study, they can understand the liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army, strengthen their idea of serving the people, so that they can go to various places to serve the masses. In addition, it can also enable us to have a deeper understanding of their abilities, skills, and other situations, so that we can assign work more appropriately.

Among this group of medical personnel, when it comes to work, they are first afraid of going to the army, and in the local area, they don't want to leave far. Some simply cannot leave Beiping, and even specify the East City and West City. Secondly, there is the issue of salary and benefits. Generally, they are still suspicious in their minds, and there are too many family ties. Beiping cannot accommodate so many people. Some have very low technical skills, but they certainly hope that the treatment can support their family of three or four, or even seven or eight. Some have young children, cannot leave, and cannot work full-time (especially nurses and midwives). Some have very old qualifications, have been officials in the Kuomintang army or administrative organs for many years, their skills are almost forgotten, and it is difficult to undertake current health administrative work, so it is not easy to assign work.

In the past, due to living habits and the ruling class's fundamental lack of the leading ideology of "serving the people," many medical personnel were concentrated in large cities without suitable work; while the vast rural areas needed them. On the current medical front, mobilizing medical personnel from large and medium-sized cities to work in small cities, towns, and rural areas is a very important organizational task. How to inspire and promote it is worthy of attention and research.

　　组织医务人员下乡的经验
    朱昆
    北平解放以后，军管卫生部登报办理流散失业的医务人员登记。自三月七日起至四月初止，共登记了约五百七十人。其中各科医生、助理医生及实习医生一九四人，药剂人员六一人，助产士、护士、助理员及技术员等二百四十余人，兽医四七人，中医二个人。
    从这些人的来源看，大部是从其他地区集中到这里来的（主要是东北、山东、山西），一部是原国民党军队中的军医，在解放前后脱离军队跑到城里来的，另外一部是多年没有做事（多因结婚、生子、家务问题等的女医务人员），还有一些是技术水平很低，无法找到工作的。
    登记后，量才录用分配到各工作岗位上去的约三百六十人：华北地区一百五十七人、北平市区十一人、南下各部门六十五人、西北解放区教授、教员四十人、渤海军区十八人、介绍到各医院实习后分配工作之医生六十八人，此外除了已自谋职业者外，尚有一百五十余人因受各种原因的限制，还在等待分配工作。
    在这次的工作中，我们觉得有下面这些问题：
    进入新解放城市，首先有可能将这样一批失业医务人员组织起来，到乡村及其他工作岗位上去。
    举办登记时加以甄别，了解其技术水平，明确他可以担任何种工作，以及他（她）们愿意到那个地区工作，以便合理的分配。
    根据经验，在登记之后，学习一短时期再行分配，是最好的办法。或采取训练班的形式，与座谈会的方式均可。主要是使其了解我们的政策（特别是清除某些对解放区的错误认识，恐惧观念），认清国际国内形势的发展，革命胜利的前途，和一些革命的基本理论，为人民服务的观点。另外还需介绍一些解放区医务工作的情况，医务人员技术的学习与提高，和与工农结合的实际例子，以及解决其他思想顾虑，如生活待遇问题，怕吃苦的问题，没有设备什么都不能做……等等。例如在某训练班中，开始有一次动员一部份人到石门去。一个姓王的医生向别人表示：“若叫我去，反正我死也不走。”而学习完了后，毫不犹疑的到渤海区去工作了。另外一位姓刘的护理员，以前老是要求派到北平附近，怕离开家，但学习之后（也受到大军渡江的影响），自动要求参加了南下工作团。所以我们认为经过这一短期学习，使他们对解放区、解放军了解，加强其为人民服务的思想，以便其能到各地去为群众服务。另外，也可使我们比较深刻的了解他们的能力技术，和其他情况，以便能更恰当的分配工作。
    这一批医务人员中，谈到工作时，首先是怕到部队去，在地方上不愿离远，有些根本不能离开北平，甚至指定东城西城。其次便是薪金待遇，一般的在思想上还心怀疑惧，家庭牵累太多，而北平又无法安置这样多人。也有的是技术水平很低，但他却一定希望待遇能养他一家三四口，甚至七八口，或有些有小孩子，不能离开，无法完全工作（特别是护士及助产士）。又有些是资格很老，在国民党军队或行政机关做官多年，技术差不多都忘干净了，做现在的卫生行政工作又很难担负，便不容易分配工作。
    以往，由于生活习惯及统治者根本没有“为人民服务”的领导思想，使得在大城市中集中了许多医务人员，没有适当的工作；而广大的农村正需要着他们。在目前的医务战线上，发动大、中城市的医务人员到小城市、乡镇及农村中去工作，是一个很重要的组织工作。应该如何启发与推动，是很值得重视和研究的。
