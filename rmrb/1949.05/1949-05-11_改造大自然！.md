Editorial Notes

    Transforming Nature!
    The increasingly prosperous socialist motherland, the Soviet Union, is waging a struggle to conquer nature with unparalleled tenacity. The implementation of the plan to plant protective forest belts further clarifies the greatness of the outstanding socialist system. In contrast, in the United States, almost half of the country's forests have been cut down, riverbeds are changing, water and soil are not easily conserved, and drought is threatening American farmers! In states like New York, Minnesota, and throughout the Southern states, forests are barely visible. The American "ruling gentlemen" do not seek happiness for the people; their greedy eyes are only focused on seizing the people's forests from their hands.

    改造大自然！
    经济日趋繁荣的社会主义祖国苏联，正以无比的顽强进行征服大自然的斗争。在植造防护林带的计划实施中，更使人们清楚地认识到卓越的社会主义制度的伟大。反观美国，全国森林差不多已有一半被砍去，河床在变动，水土不易保持，旱灾在威胁着美国的农民！在纽约、明尼苏达等州以及南部各州几乎看不到什么森林了。美国的“执政先生们”不会为人民谋幸福，他们的贪婪的眼光所及，不过是从人们手中把人民的森林掠夺了去了事。
