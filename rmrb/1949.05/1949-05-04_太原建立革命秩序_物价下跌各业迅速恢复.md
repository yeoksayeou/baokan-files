　　[Taiyuan Electric] Taiyuan has been liberated for a week, and a revolutionary order has been established. At 10:00 AM on the 24th, as soon as the battle ended, the Taiyuan Military Control Commission, the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Garrison Command, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions were successively established or entered the city to work. More than 20 major fires set by the Yan bandit army have been extinguished by the fire brigade. Postal and telecommunications services have resumed postal and telegraph services, and some telephone calls have been restored. After emergency repairs, tap water has been supplied to the citizens. The power plant has been supplying power to some areas. The Zhengtai and Tongpu railways' Yu-Tai sections have been repaired. All industrial and commercial enterprises, except those that have suffered war damage and have real difficulties in starting business, have begun operations on the 29th. The Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China was established on the 24th and began to collect counterfeit gold yuan notes on the 26th, with an exchange rate of 10,000 yuan of counterfeit gold yuan notes for 1 yuan of People's Bank notes. Employees and students enjoy an 80% discount. In addition to setting up exchange offices and agent exchange offices, there are also four mobile exchange teams working in factories and suburban areas. Citizens have been enthusiastically exchanging money for days, and they have all automatically refused to use counterfeit gold yuan notes. Because state-owned trading companies had made sufficient preparations in advance, daily necessities such as coal and grain were continuously transported in, reaching more than 1,545,000 catties of grain, more than 2,700 bags of flour, more than 370,000 catties of oil, and more than 280,000 catties of edible salt. Prices have fallen sharply compared with before liberation. The Taiyuan Branch of Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company has been supplying citizens with large quantities of coal at low prices since the 28th. Yangquan mixed coal is 1,600 yuan per ton, Xishan mixed coal is 1,000 yuan, fat coal is 720 yuan, and coal dust is 240 yuan. The state-owned Taiyuan Trading Company also began selling large quantities of grain, oil, and salt on the 28th, and organized 12 sales agencies. Before liberation, each catty of black bean cake required 170 yuan of People's Bank notes; after liberation, it fell to 23 yuan on the 25th, and then to 18 yuan. White flour sold for 200 yuan per catty before liberation, but now it only sells for 36 yuan.
