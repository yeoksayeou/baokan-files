Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 22nd: The Guixi Commissioner's Office in the newly liberated area of northeastern Jiangxi has been established. The takeover work in Yiyang, Guixi, Yujiang, and other counties under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner's Office is progressing actively. The Commissioner's Office also appointed the county heads of Jinxi, Dongxiang, Jinxian, and Linchuan counties, and the mayor of Linchuan City on the 14th, to go to their respective counties and cities to carry out the takeover work and establish county and city people's governments.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 22nd: The People's Liberation Army advancing into eastern Zhejiang has received warm support and welcome from local people's guerrillas and the broad masses of the people. A large number of young guerrilla fighters have joined the advance reconnaissance teams of the eastward advance field army, operating near enemy strongholds, and actively helping the field army raise food on the battlefield. Even before the People's Liberation Army arrived at the Cao'e River, several guerrilla fighters had secretly crossed the Cao'e River, passed through the enemy's defense lines, and delivered good news to the people under enemy rule, and prepared supplies for the army in advance. As the People's Liberation Army continued its eastward advance, people along the way warmly greeted the Liberation Army with tea, and poured out their accusations against the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit army. The people of Banqiao Town, east of Xiaoshan, said, "When those thief Kuomintang fled, they robbed the shoes off our feet." When the Liberation Army entered Keqiao Town in Shaoxing at night, every household lit up lights to welcome them.

　　赣东北贵溪专署成立
  　人民解放军挺进浙东  游击队与人民支援欢迎
    【新华社浙赣前线二十二日电】赣东北新解放区的贵溪专员公署已经成立。该专署所辖弋阳、贵溪、余江等县的接收工作正积极进行中。专署并已于十四日委派金溪、东乡、进贤、临川等县县长及临川市市长，分赴各该县、市进行接收工作及成立县、市人民政府。
    【新华社浙赣前线二十二日电】向浙东挺进的人民解放军受到当地人民游击队和广大人民的热烈支援和欢迎，大批的青年游击队员参加了东进野战军的先头侦察队，到敌人据点附近活动，并积极帮助野战军在战地筹粮。还在解放军抵达曹娥江以前，就有几个游击队员偷渡过曹娥江去，穿过敌人防线，向敌人统治下的人民传送捷报，并预为大军筹备给养。人民解放军继续东进途中，一路上的人民提着茶水热情招待解放军，一面滔滔不绝地控诉着国民党匪军的罪行，萧山以东的板桥镇人民说：“那些贼国民党逃命时，把我们脚上的鞋子都抢走了。”当解放军星夜进入绍兴的柯桥镇时，家家点起了欢迎的灯火。
