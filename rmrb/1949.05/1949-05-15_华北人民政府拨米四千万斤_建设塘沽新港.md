North China People's Government
    Allocates 40 Million Jin of Rice to Build Tanggu New Port
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The first phase of the Tanggu New Port construction plan has now been approved by the North China People's Government, allocating 41,822,340 jin of millet as construction funds. This plan will complete the following projects and preparatory work before 1950: (1) Repairing the gaps in the breakwater and extending it to four meters, beyond the Dagu shoal. (2) Dredging the航道 to five meters and constructing a 3.2-meter-long silt interception dam, allowing ships with a draft of two to three chi [Chinese foot, 市尺] to pass unhindered at high tide. (3) Surveying and studying various deep-water waterfront structures to obtain the most economical and reliable engineering facilities. (4) Preparing a large reserve of construction materials. (5) Overhauling the 3,000-ton repair dock, striving for self-sufficiency in shipyard funding in the short term. The New Port Engineering Bureau, after reorganization and adjustment of wages, has extremely high morale among its employees and is actively arranging the commencement of work. It has already salvaged two ships and repaired more than ten wooden boats, and plans to dredge 188,000 cubic meters in May.
