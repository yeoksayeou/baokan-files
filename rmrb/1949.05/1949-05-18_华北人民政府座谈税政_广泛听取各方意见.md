The North China People's Government Holds Tax Policy Forum
Broadly Solicits Opinions from All Parties

[This newspaper's dispatch] Before the official convening of the joint conference of directors of tax bureaus from provinces, regions, and cities in North China by the Finance Department of the North China People's Government at the North China Tax Bureau, tax policy symposiums have been held at the North China Tax Bureau for several consecutive days since the middle of this month. Leaders of relevant agencies attending the meeting included Lan Gongwu, Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government, Song Shaowen, Secretary-General of the Financial and Economic Committee, Yao Yilin, Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Wu Bo, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance. Representatives from the North China Financial and Economic Committee, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Enterprises, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Finance, People's Bank, Cooperative Committee, Customs, Postal and Telecommunications Administration, Highway Administration, Municipal Government Research Office, and Beiping Trading Branch, as well as directors of tax bureaus from provinces, regions, and cities under the jurisdiction of the North China Tax Bureau, totaling over 90 people, also attended. Democratic figures participating included Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Qian Jiaju, Wang Shao'ao, Zhang [@ Bo], Bao Dasan, Hu Ziying, Fan Hong, Ling Da[@] and others. The symposiums began at 9:00 AM. Deputy Minister Wu of the Ministry of Finance spoke first, expressing hope that everyone would provide opinions on the immature materials related to direct taxes, indirect taxes, local taxes, and various procedural methods proposed by the Tax Bureau. He stated, "The legislative spirit for formulating future tax laws will be based on the following principles: (1) Starting from the perspective of developing production, not only should we take care of the reproduction of industrialists and merchants, but we should also enable them to accumulate capital and expand production. (2) Appropriately balance the burden between urban and rural areas, and it must be acknowledged that the burden on farmers is currently quite heavy. If we do not appropriately reduce their burden to increase general purchasing power in rural areas, it will also be detrimental to the development of urban industry and commerce. (3) Take care of the wartime financial situation. (4) Simplify tax types and simplify procedures to facilitate industry and commerce."

Subsequently, Director Li of the North China Tax Bureau provided a concise analysis and comparison of tax types and tax rates under the two regimes; he listed a total of 12 types of taxes levied in the old liberated areas, and as many as 50 types of various taxes levied by the pseudo-Kuomintang in Tianjin and Beiping in the past. After liberation, only 15 types of taxes were levied successively in Tianjin and Beiping. Now, with reference to the tax laws of the old areas, various taxes are being reorganized, and materials for 19 types of direct taxes, indirect taxes, and local taxes planned to be levied in the future have been drafted. Director Li also stated, "The research and drafting are very rough, so we invite everyone to participate in the symposium and listen to the opinions of all gentlemen and comrades, revise them again, and submit them to the government for approval and implementation."

Various democratic figures spoke in succession. Mr. Wang Shao'ao, in addition to agreeing with the aforementioned legislative spirit, also expressed five opinions on issues such as tax law standards. Following him, Mr. Qian Jiaju, Mr. Fan Hong, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Mr. Ling Da[@] and others contributed many opinions on issues such as comprehensive income tax, salary and wage income tax, inheritance tax, business license tax, and simplification of tax collection procedures. They also believed that under the task of supporting the national liberation war and striving for complete victory, taking care of financial revenue is necessary.

The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.

Today, city industrialists and merchants will continue to be invited to participate in the symposium, and preparations are being made to go to Tianjin within the next few days to also invite industrialists and merchants to participate in the symposium to listen to their opinions and feedback.

　　华北人民政府座谈税政
  　广泛听取各方意见
    【本报讯】华北人民政府财政部在华北税务总局正式召开华北各省区市税务局局长联席会议之前，自本月中旬起，在华北税务总局连日举行税政座谈会，到会机关首长华北人民政府蓝公武副主席，财委会宋劭文秘书长，工商部姚依林部长，财政部吴波副部长，并有华北财委会、工商部、企业部、交通部、财政部、人民银行、合作委员会、海关、邮电总局、公路总局、市府研究室、北平贸易分公司等代表，以及华北税务总局所辖各省区市税务局局长等共九十余人，民主人士参加者，计有章乃器、千家驹、王绍鏊、张＠伯、包达三、胡子婴、樊弘、凌大＠等先生。自上午九时起开始座谈，首由财政部吴副部长发言，希望大家就税务总局所提出不成熟的有关直接税、间接税、地方税及各种手续法的材料，提供意见。他说：“拟定今后税法的立法精神，将根据下列原则：（一）从发展生产着眼，不但要照顾工商业家的再生产，而且应使工商业者能积累资本，扩大生产。（二）适当的平衡城乡负担，并须承认现在农民的负担是相当的重，如不适当的减轻他们的负担，以提高农村一般的购买力，对城市工商业的发展，也是不利的。（三）照顾战时的财政情况。（四）简化税种与简化手续，便利工商。”
    继由华北税务总局李局长对两种政权下的税种税率，作了简明的分析比较；列举了老解放区共征税十二种，过去平津伪国民党各式各样的税共五十种之多，解放后平津两市先后征收的只十五种，现在参照老区税法整理各种税，草拟出今后计划征收的直接税、间接税、地方税等共十九种材料。李局长并谓“研究与起草，都很粗糙，所以请大家座谈，倾听各先生、各同志提示意见，再行修改，呈请政府批准施行”。
    各民主人士相继发言，王绍鏊先生除同意上述立法精神外，并就税法标准等问题，发表了五点意见，接着千家驹先生、樊弘先生、章乃器先生、凌大＠先生等，对综合所得税、薪给工资所得税、遗产税、工商牌照税、及简化稽征手续等问题，贡献了许多意见，并认为在支援全国解放战争，争取全面胜利的任务下，照顾财政收入，是必要的。
    会议进行至下午四时半散会。
    今日继续邀请市工商业家座谈，并准备日内赴津也邀请工商业家座谈，听取他们的意见和反映。
