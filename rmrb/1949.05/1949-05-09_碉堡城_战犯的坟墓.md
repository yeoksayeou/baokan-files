    Bunker City - The Graveyard of War Criminals
    袁明阮 Wu Xiang

    Last year, when I followed the army into Jinzhong, I saw bunkers scattered everywhere, and people bloated from hunger. Wormwood surrounded the bunkers, and the bunkers surrounded the wormwood. This was the rural scene under the rule of the bandit Yan at that time. Beautiful orchards were also cut down. An old man once knelt down and begged the bandits, "These are my fruit trees." The bandits said fiercely, "Yours? Even your life is ours!" Hungry people had to build fortifications for about twenty days a month. Many people starved to death while working. The bandits still robbed grain from house to house, saying, "If you don't want to give grain, unless your chimney doesn't smoke and your door doesn't have people coming and going."

    This time, when I followed the army into the Taiyuan area, I saw even more bunkers and even deeper disasters. The captured Yan bandit engineer commander Cheng Jizong confessed that he personally saw several old people who were building fortifications starving to death in front of the bunkers. And the war criminal Yan Xishan was still screaming madly, "Our fortifications must be strengthened with the rotation of the earth! For every day the earth rotates, our fortifications must be strengthened by one day!" It turns out that the war criminal Yan Xishan is not only a beast that has sucked the people's blood for forty years, but also a fortification fanatic who is doing his emperor's dream in the basement. At every military conference, he always murmured to his subordinates in a dream, "If we build these fortifications well, we will be able to exist safely."

    Within a radius of forty to fifty li centered on Taiyuan, from Wusu Airport in the south to Zhoujiashan in the north, from Hanshan in the east to Shiqianfeng and Miaoqian Mountain in the west, more than 5,000 bunkers soaked in the blood and tears of the people were built. The Shuangta Temple, which is less than two square li, has two gun bunkers, eleven main bunkers, thirty-five small bunkers, and many bunkers and secondary defenses surrounding them. According to Cheng Jizong's confession, an average of 0.4 tons of steel and 3,000 kilograms of cement are required to build a bunker. Based on 5,000 bunkers alone, 2,000 tons of steel and 15 million kilograms of cement were used. In February last year, the Yan bandits themselves estimated that 11.07 million man-days would be required for construction. According to an engineer's calculation, if cement is used for construction, at least 20,000 solid houses can be built. If these laborers are put into cultivation, at least 4,000 hectares of wasteland can be turned into fertile land. That is why wormwood has become a rich "product" of "grain" in Jinzhong; why bean cake has become a good meal in Taiyuan; why tree bark and hemp rope have become grain; and why one-third of the Yan bandits' vast soldiers, who are emaciated from hunger, cannot distinguish shooting targets at night due to night blindness.

    But this fortification fanatic named Yan, and war criminals like Sun Chu and Wang Jingguo, still shrunk like ghosts in the steel-boned cement basement of the "Pacification Commissioner's Office," designing a perfect "Bunker City" by the dim light: colorful clusters of bunkers, layers upon layers of deer villages, barbed wire, electric wire, escarpment-like crisscrossing trenches, and rat-hole-like secret passages - the Yan bandits called this "masterpiece" "four layers on the plane, four layers in three dimensions," ordering their subordinates to build several positions according to his statistics into "permanent fortifications" that could withstand 10,000 shells! When the American war peddler Chennault, who was anxious and furious at the rapid collapse of the Kuomintang traitorous government, suddenly flew to Taiyuan, he also suddenly felt that his "business" was still promising and praised it endlessly. An American imperialist journalist once described it this way: "Anyone who comes to Taiyuan will be surprised by the countless bunkers: high, low, square, round, triangular, and even hidden underground, forming an incredibly dense network of fire." All these warmongers who are good at turning the people's blood and tears into money in their pockets, like Yan Xishan himself, will naturally only see the strong bunkers standing in the Taiyuan plain, and will never want to see the fresh blood permeating each bunker. Yan bandit Xishan once criticized many senior generals of the Kuomintang, saying, "You only armed the people, but you did not arm the land." He did not know that although he "armed the land," he could not truly arm the people who were temporarily under his rule. All Kuomintang bandits could not truly and effectively arm their people. When the artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, which had gathered around Taiyuan, began the general offensive, the vast people and soldiers under the control of Yan bandits finally expressed their true will. The East City garrison crawled out of the underground fortifications and went to the attacking PLA, saying: "Yan Xishan ordered us to defend it even if we die, and we will not defend it even if we die!" The Heituo garrison raised a white flag to the attackers, and the four battalions of the garrison in the north of the city gave the PLA two assault routes through the clusters of bunkers. Many permanent fortifications became the forward positions for the siege without firing a shot. The heroic people of Taiyuan, braving fierce artillery fire to lead the PLA to wedge into the dense bunker area, were the workers of Taiyuan. Those who followed the PLA to outflank the flanks of the group fortifications were the workers and peasants who had built the fortifications there. A farmer grabbed the hand of a People's Liberation Army soldier in the heat of battle and said, "Comrades, come with me, I know where the enemy is!" The war criminals who tried to escape punishment with "Bunker City" finally discovered that they were actually drilling in a grave full of heinous crimes.

    碉堡城——战犯的坟墓
    袁明阮  吴象
    去年记者随军进入晋中，满眼是星罗棋布的碉堡和饿得浮肿的人民。蒿草包围着碉堡，碉堡又包围着蒿草。这就是当时阎匪统治下的农村景象。美丽的果树园也被砍伐了。一个老百姓曾向匪徒们跪下哀求道：“这是我的果子树。”匪徒们却凶狠地说：“你的？连你的命都是我们的哩！”饥饿的人民每个月得修筑二十天左右的工事。好些人在劳作的时候饿死了。匪徒们仍然挨家抢粮，并且说：“要想不出粮，除非你家的烟囱不冒烟，门户不走人。”
    这次记者随军进入太原地区，看到了更多的碉堡和更加深重的灾难。被俘的阎匪工兵司令程继宗就供称他亲眼见到的，就有好几个正在修工事的老百姓饿死在碉堡跟前。而战犯阎锡山仍然疯着狂叫：“我们的工事要随着地球的转动而加强！地球转动一天，我们的工事就要加强一天！”原来战犯阎锡山不但是一只吸了四十年人民膏血的野兽，而且还是一个钻到地下室里大做其皇帝梦的工事迷信者。在每次军事会议上，他总要对部属喃喃地梦呓着说：“把这些工事修好了，我们就能够安安稳稳地存在了。”
    以太原为中心的四五十里半径以内，南至武宿机场，北至周家山，东至罕山，西至石千峰和庙千山，修筑了五千多座渗透着人民血泪的碉堡。不满两平方华里的双塔寺，就筑有两个炮碉，十一个主碉，三十五个小碉，以及围绕着它们的许多地堡和副防御物。据程继宗供称：平均修筑一座碉堡需要零·四吨钢，三千公斤洋灰。仅以五千座碉堡计算，就用去了二千吨钢和一千五百万公斤洋灰。去年二月阎匪自己预计，就必需一千一百零七万个人工投入修筑。据一位工程师计算，如果洋灰用于建设，至少可以修盖二万间坚固的洋房，如果把这些劳动力投入耕种，至少可以使四千顷荒地变成良田。这就是为什么蒿草成了晋中“粮食”的丰盛“产品”；为什么豆饼在太原成了好饭；为什么树皮和麻绳成了粮食；为什么饿得面黄肌瘦的阎匪广大士兵，有三分之一因患夜盲症而不会在夜间辨别射击目标。
    可是这位姓阎的工事迷信者和孙楚、王靖国辈战犯，依然象幽灵一样缩在“绥靖公署”里的钢骨洋灰地下室里，借着暗淡的灯光设计着一座尽善尽美的“碉堡城”：五花八门的群堡，一层又一层的鹿寨，铁线网、电网、削壁似的纵横错杂的壕堑和老鼠洞一样的暗道——阎匪把这种“杰作”叫做“平面四层，立体四层”，命令部属们按照他的统计把几个阵地都修成能够经得起一万发炮弹的“永久工事”！眼看国民党卖国政府迅速崩溃而急得屁滚尿流的美国战争贩子阵纳德，一旦飞临太原也忽然感到他的“买卖”还大有可为而赞颂不已。有一个美帝国主义的新闻记者曾经这样描写道：“任何人到了太原，都会为数不清的碉堡而吃惊：高的、低的、方的、圆的、三角形的，甚至藏在地下的，构成了不可思议的密集火网。”所有这些善于把人民血泪变成袋中洋钱的好战之徒，也和阎锡山本人一样，自然只会看见林立在太原川的强固碉堡，而永远不愿意看到了渗透每座碉堡的鲜血。阎匪锡山曾经批评过国民党的许多高级将领说：“你们只是武装了人，却没有武装了地。”他不知道，虽然他“武装了地”，却无法把暂时受他统治的人真正地武装起来，一切国民党匪首都无法真正有效地把他们的人武装起来。当云集太原周围的人民解放军的炮火开始总攻的轰击时，阎匪魔掌下的广大人民和士兵群众终于表达出了他们真正的意志。东城守军从地下工事爬到攻城的解放军跟前说：“阎锡山命令我们死了也要守住，我们就死也不守！”黑驼守军向攻击者举起了白旗，城北四个营守军给解放军让出两条穿过群堡的突击道路。许多永久工事一枪未响便成了攻城的前进阵地了。英勇的太原人民，冒着激烈炮火带领解放军楔入密集碉堡地带的是太原工人，随着解放军迂回到集团工事侧后的是曾经在那里修筑工事的工人和农民。一个农民在战火中拉着人民战士的手说：“同志们跟我来吧，我知道什么地方有敌人！”企图以“碉堡城”逃脱惩罚的战犯们，终于发现他原来是钻在罪恶深重的坟墓里了【新华社北平八日电】
