    Yangquan Handles Indexed Savings to Help Workers Establish Families
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Yangquan branch of the People's Bank has been handling real-value guaranteed savings for two months and has initially established a foundation among various state-owned enterprises and workers. Among the twenty-plus state-owned factories and mines in Yangquan, there are already three hundred deposit accounts, with a total deposit of over 200,000 @. This has played a certain role in regulating the market economy and stabilizing prices. It has resolved the concerns of some units in the past who were afraid of losing money when withdrawing funds and did not dare to boldly invest. Moreover, it guarantees the income of workers' salaries and reduces the phenomenon of rising prices caused by workers spending their wages indiscriminately in the market after receiving them. At the same time, a trial run of wage payments on behalf of the units has been conducted three times, solving the difficulties of various units in paying wages and strengthening relations with workers. In the development of this work, many factory and mine trade union cadres and factory directors actively publicized and explained to the workers, dispelling their doubts and worries (not believing that there would be such a good deal). The trade union of the Seventeenth Iron Factory regarded indexed savings as a worker welfare undertaking. During workers' breaks after work, they gathered everyone to invite comrades from the bank to publicize and, during study time, inspired workers to discuss it. Factory Director Zhang of the factory took the lead in depositing money himself and deposited money for workers to solve the problem of workers not having time. In March, when wages were paid, the bank sent people to the factory to handle deposit procedures. As a result, the Iron Factory had the most depositors, reaching about fifty people. In other factories, such as the Xinglong Porcelain Factory and the Fourth Factory, the factory directors and trade unions also actively promoted and took the lead in depositing money. On the one hand, they helped the bank to promote deposit work, and on the other hand, they also helped the workers to establish families and stabilize their production mood.

    阳泉办理折实储蓄帮助职工建立家务
    【石家庄讯】人民银行阳泉办事处，办理实物保本存款两个月来，在各公营企业和职工中，已初步建立基础。阳泉二十多个公营厂矿中，已有三百存款户，计存入二十余万＠。对于市场经济调剂与平稳物价，了一定作用。解决了过去一些单位怕领款赔钱而不敢大胆储资的顾虑，而且保证了职工薪资所得，减少发薪后投入市场乱买东西而引起的物价上涨等现象。同时试办代发工资三次，解决各单位发资困难，密切与职工关系。在这一工作的开展中，不少厂矿中的职工会干部和厂长，积极向职工宣传讲解，打破工友们的怀疑顾虑（不相信会有这样的便宜事），铁厂十七厂职工会把折实储蓄当做工人福利事业办理，在工友下班休息时间，召集大家请银行同志来宣传，并在学习时间启发工友进行讨论。该厂张厂长自已首先带头存储，并代工友到银行存款，解决工友没时间的困难。三月份发工资时银行派人到工厂办理存款手续。结果铁厂存户最多，达五十人左右。其他如兴隆瓷厂与四厂，厂长、职工会也都积极推动并带头存款。一面帮助银行推进存款工作，一面也帮助工友们建立家务安定生产情绪。
