    Plunging into the Enemy's Bunker Complex
    Zhang Tong
    On April 18th, the regimental headquarters ordered the assault company – the Sixth Company – to plunge into the enemy's bunker complex south of Shacun at 9:00 PM to eliminate the enemy. Shells roared on the ground and bullets spun in the air, as if the friendly forces attacking Mazhuang had completely attracted and controlled the enemy's firepower in Mazhuang.
    Company Commander Wang, leading the assault platoon, calmly and boldly climbed over the bunkers, crossed the natural ravines, and went to the enemy's position. After crossing the first ravine, there was an open area stretching 300 meters ahead, at the end of which was the No. 2 bunker on the left flank. To pass through this open area, they had to be even more calm, quiet, and restrained.
    "This is a critical point. If we are discovered by the enemy too early, it will further increase the difficulty of carrying out the mission," the regimental and battalion leaders had repeatedly instructed before the departure. These words were deeply imprinted in the hearts of every member of the assault team.
    As the assault platoon was displaying their "night-stalking skills," suddenly two enemy flares illuminated the open area, but the assault platoon quickly lay flat on the ground like a black line. The enemy did not detect them, but they clearly saw the sentries in the enemy's field fortifications, the turtle-shell-like bunkers, and the illuminating firewood ninety meters away from the bunker. After the flares went out, everything in front of them was dark again, but soon the previous visibility was restored. Deputy Platoon Leader Li Jinfeng, who was feeling his way at the head of the group, waved his hand, and a black shadow bent over and flashed up. He pointed to the illuminating firewood and looked at that black shadow, Li Hongxuan, who quickly and silently lay down next to the illuminating firewood and took out the prepared scissors to cut the fuse.
    The assault team moved forward incessantly, calmly, and quietly. Eventually, they almost crawled to the edge of the enemy's outer trench, but the enemy still did not detect them. Someone accidentally tripped over a small broken branch, which landed on the steel helmet of an assault team member with a "tap" sound. The enemy sentry shouted, "Who is there?" No one answered. "Who?..." Still no one answered. But when the sentry realized that the illuminating firewood could not be lit, he immediately panicked and shouted, "The enemy is coming! The enemy is coming!"
    The assault team, regardless of everything, rushed to occupy the No. 2 bunker and eliminate the enemy. One by one, the flying mines flew from the hands of the assault team members, and machine guns and submachine guns angrily spat out bullets. At the same time, assault team member Yang Shou suddenly leaned the ladder against the outside of the trench. Liu Sheng, Fang Jingshan, and Liu Yongting, without waiting for the ladder to be firmly in place, jumped down with the deputy platoon leader. Immediately, the machine gun squad, the second squad, and the third squad, the entire assault platoon, jumped down into the outer trench and developed to both sides. All of this took no more than a minute.
    The enemy wanted to escape. The lucky ones who had not died fired two shots in vain and ran away, joining up with other bunkers. The signal told everyone that the No. 2 bunker had been occupied by us.
    Without rest, the assault platoon followed the communication trench to charge towards another bunker. The enemy, taking advantage of our lack of deep penetration, had the courage to launch three consecutive counterattacks against the assault platoon. Every member of the assault team knew that their operation was supported by many brotherly units and friendly forces, as well as powerful artillery. They had the firm belief to defeat the enemy's counterattacks, boldly plunge into the enemy's bunker complex, develop forward, pin down the enemy, and eliminate the enemy. Flying mines, grenades, and bullets exploded and roared in front of the enemy. The assault platoon not only smashed the enemy's counterattacks but also pushed an enemy platoon into a field fortification, either capturing or killing them all.
    The second platoon, using firepower to support the assault platoon and victoriously charging and killing inside the enemy lines, attacked the No. 4 bunker from the front, using flying mines to kill the enemy platoon leader and rocket launchers to destroy the enemy's fortifications. The No. 4 bunker was also occupied by us. Coordinating with the actions of the assault platoon, instructor Bai Zhizhong also led the third platoon from the south into the enemy's No. 5 bunker. Chen Dou sacrificed heroically, and Zhou Shang immediately got the explosives to the enemy's barbed wire, blasting open the barbed wire. The machine guns roared, and the third platoon stormed into the No. 5 bunker. An enemy platoon, along with all their equipment, were all captured by us.

### 插进敌人碉堡群

    插进敌人碉堡群
    张同
    四月十八日，团指挥所命令突击连——六连，在晚上九点插到沙村以南敌人碉堡群中去消灭敌人。炮弹在地上咆哮、子弹在空中周转，好象攻马庄的友军已完全把马庄敌人火力控制吸引住。
    王连长带着突击排，沉着大胆地爬过碉堡，越过自然沟到敌人阵地去。过了第一道沟，再前边便是一片长达三百米的开阔地，尽头便是左阵二号碉。如果通过这块开阔地，就必须更加作到沉着、静肃，就必须沉住气，都要加以控制。
    “这是个关键，如果过早被敌发觉，将要更增加执行任务的困难，”出发前团首长和营首长已再三嘱咐过，这些话都深深的记在每个突击队员的心坎中。
    当突击排正在施展“夜摸术”的时候，突然敌人的两个照明弹把这块开阔地照了个透亮，但是，突击排象一条黑线一样迅速地紧伏在地下，敌人没有发觉他们，而他们却清清楚楚的看见敌野战工事里的哨兵，象王八盖子似的碉堡和该堡九十米达的照明柴。照明弹熄了后，眼前又是黑压压的一片，什么也看不见了，但是不久，又恢复了先前的视光。副排长李金风摸在最头里的一个组，招了招手，一个黑影子弯着腰闪上来，他指指照明柴，又看那黑影子李宏宣，便迅速无声的卧倒在照明柴旁，掏出准备好的剪刀把拉火线剪断。
    突击队不停地、沉着地、静肃地向前摸去，最后简直爬到了敌外壕边沿，敌人却仍然没有发觉。不知谁抉跌一个投断的小树枝，正好落在突击队员的钢盔上“嗒”的一响，敌哨兵叫起来：“谁呢？”没人答。“谁？……”仍是没人答。可是当哨兵发觉照明柴不能拉着时，立即恐慌喊起来了：“敌人来了！敌人来了！”
    突击队不顾一切的为占领二号碉，消灭敌人，于是飞雷一个一个地从突击队员的手里飞出去，机枪与冲锋枪发怒般的喷出子弹。与这同时，突击队员杨寿骤然将梯子靠在壕沟外，刘生、房景山、刘永亭没等梯子靠牢，就随着副排长扑去，扑通跳了下去。紧接机枪班、二班、三班整个突击排都跳下外壕，并向两边发展了，这全部的时间也不过一分多钟。
    敌人要逃了，侥幸没死的敌人，虚放两枪，拔脚就跑，和别的碉堡靠拢起来。信号告诉了人们，二号碉已被我们占领了。
    没有得到休息，突击排又顺着交通壕向另一个碉堡冲击过去。敌人欺负我们不孤军深入，曾壮起胆子向突击排连续三次反扑。每个突击队员都知道他们的作战是有许多兄弟连队和友军以及强大的炮兵配合的，他们有坚强的信念打垮敌人反扑，大胆的插进敌人的碉堡群。并向前发展，钉住敌人，消灭敌人。飞雷、手榴弹、子弹，在敌人前面爆炸着叫哮着，突击排不但把敌人的反扑打垮，并把敌人一个排挤到野战堡里，把他们全部俘虏的俘虏打死的打死。
    用火力支援突击排，在敌人内部胜利冲杀着的第二排，从前面向四号碉打去，用飞雷打死了敌人排长，用火箭炮摧毁了敌人工事，四号碉也被我们占领了。配合着突击排的动作，指导员白志忠也带着三排从南面杀进了敌人的五号碉，陈斗小牺牲了，周尚马上把炸药搞到敌铁丝网里，炸开了铁丝网，机枪猛叫着，三排突进了五号碉，敌人一个排，连同他们全付武装，都被我们俘虏了。
