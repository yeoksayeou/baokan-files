    Zilliacus –
    Zilliacus, a left-wing member of the British Labour Party, was born in Japan in 1894. His father was Swedish, and his mother was American. He lived with his parents in Europe during his childhood, attended school in England at the age of thirteen, and graduated from Yale University in the United States at the age of nineteen. At that time, it was during the European War, he returned to England, joined the Air Force, and became a British citizen, later joining the Labour Party. He worked in the Secretariat of the League of Nations in Geneva and served as the League of Nations correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. At that time, he exposed Germany's conspiracy to re-launch aggression and wrote many pamphlets warning people to rise up against Chamberlain, who condoned the fascists. After the Labour Party came to power, he consistently opposed Bevin's foreign policy, opposed Britain becoming a pawn and outpost of the anti-communist bloc under American control, advocated cooperation between the Labour Party and the Communist Party, and advocated that Britain, the Soviet Union, and France cooperate to rebuild Europe. He has been a Labour Party parliamentary representative since 1938 and served as the Secretary-General of the Labour Party's Foreign Affairs Committee.
