    【Taihang Dispatch】A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, with the force of a thunderbolt, tightly surrounded the isolated island of Anyang. From dawn on the 17th of last month to the 23rd, after a week of fighting, most of the outlying strongholds, except for the urban pass, have been cleared by our forces. A total of 448 bandits from the bandit units of Guo Qing, Wang Jingchang, and Wang Sanzhu were killed or wounded, 690 enemies were captured, and 259 surrendered, totaling 1,397 enemies annihilated, and a large amount of supplies were seized. Twenty-five strongholds around the city, including Taipingzhuang, Yuanjiafen, Guangyi Yarn Factory, Guojiawan, Anyang Bridge, Biegai Mountain, Yuwang Temple, Dongguan Round, Xiguan Round, Fujiazhuang, and Changzhiwan, were captured. The remaining bandits in the urban pass have now become turtles in a jar, and our Liberation Army is continuing to encircle and annihilate them.
