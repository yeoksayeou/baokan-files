    This Newspaper Invites Literary and Art Circles in Beiping
    to Discuss Literary Supplement Issues
    [This Newspaper] This newspaper invited literary and art circles in Beiping to a symposium at Laijin Yuxuan, Zhongshan Park, at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 12th) to discuss issues related to the newspaper's literary supplement. Those in attendance included Yang Yuqian, Hu Feng, Ai Qing, He Qifang, Sha Kefu, Feng Zhi, Wen Jiasi, Yang Hui, Zhao Shuli, Ouyang Shan, Bian Zhilin, He Jiahua, Ma Yanxiang, Yang Shuo, Zang Kejia, Cai Ruohong, Jiang Muliang, Bi Ye, and Lü Jian, totaling more than twenty people. Everyone offered many positive suggestions on editing the supplement, unanimously agreeing that the literary supplement should cater to the demands of the broad urban population, being both serious and lively. In addition to publishing various forms of literary works, especially short pieces, it should publish more literary theory and criticism that guides creation, and appropriately展开 various discussions on relevant literary issues. In terms of editing, close contact with the broad readership and planning and initiative in work should be maintained. In addition, for drama and film work, the supplement should publish more articles on film and drama criticism and the reform of traditional opera, and propose the publication of a "Drama and Film Supplement." The symposium concluded at 6:00 PM.

    座谈文艺副刊问题
    【本报讯】本报于昨日（十二日）下午二时，在中山公园来今雨轩邀请在平文艺界座谈本报文艺副刊问题，到有临阳予倩、胡风、艾青、何其芳、沙可夫、冯至、闻家驷、杨晦、赵树理、欧阳山、卞之琳、何家槐、马彦祥、杨朔、臧克家、蔡若虹、蒋牧良、碧野、吕剑等二十余人。大家对编辑副刊提出许多积极意见，一致认为文艺副刊应适合广大城市人民的要求，既要严肃，又要活泼，除登载各种形式特别是短小形式的文艺作品外，应多多发表对创作有指导作用的文艺理论与批评，并适当地展开有关文艺问题的各种讨论。编辑方面应保持与广大读者的密切联系及工作上的计划性、主动性。此外，为戏剧电影工作，副刊应多登有关影剧批评及旧剧改革工作的文章，并提议出版“戏剧电影副刊”。座谈至六时散会。
