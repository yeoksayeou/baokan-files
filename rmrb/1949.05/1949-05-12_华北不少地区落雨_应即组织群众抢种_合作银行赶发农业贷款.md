    [Report from this newspaper] It has been raining near Beiping since 20:12 the day before yesterday. By 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the rainfall reached 14.8 millimeters, moistening the soil about four or five fingers deep, enough for basic sowing. The Thirteenth District (suburban area) People's Government issued an urgent notice to village cadres yesterday (the 11th), urging them to quickly transform the original drought resistance mutual aid groups into sowing groups to carry out sowing work. A shock sowing committee was also organized for unified leadership, making full use of activists, students, blackboards, and various meetings for extensive publicity. Cadres are required to personally organize and adjust all manpower and animal power to seize the opportunity of moist soil and rush planting. Inspections should be carried out afterward. (Chao Qi)
    [Taiyuan, 11th Dispatch] There was a joyful rain in the city of Taiyuan this morning at about 7:00 a.m., and the people rejoiced. From spring to summer, the climate has been arid, affecting wheat seedlings and spring ploughing. Yesterday, the city celebrated victory, and this morning there was joyful rain, which can be described as double happiness.
    [Ping City News] In the past two days, there have been consecutive joyful rains near Beiping. In order to help farmers seize the opportunity to sow, the Cooperative Bank's business department is concentrating its efforts to expedite agricultural loans in the suburbs. According to the person in charge of the department: This year's spring agricultural loans in the suburbs of Beiping have been distributed successively since the beginning of last month. As of the 7th of this month, the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 24th districts have all been distributed; the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th districts are currently being distributed, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total. Now that there is widespread rain, the bank has specially notified the districts that have not yet completed agricultural loans to concentrate their efforts to expedite distribution. The staff of the department are also actively cooperating. The original plan was to complete the distribution on the 15th, but now it is planned to be completed on the 12th. (Yu)

    [Jidong Dispatch] On the 26th of last month, most areas of the region experienced rainfall, and the ground was soaked to a depth of three to four inches. In addition to promptly and urgently ordering all special districts and counties to immediately transfer a large number of cadres to organize cotton planting work teams, rushing to the countryside day and night to inspect, supervise, and help the masses rush to plant cotton, the administrative office also transferred more than 140 cadres from its subordinate departments, institutes, and trade departments to form three cotton planting work teams, which departed on the 28th of last month to help with sowing.

In order to seize the opportunity and rush to sow, the district immediately convened a meeting of village cadres and representatives of the rain-affected villages on the same day, deciding to organize all manpower and animal power to carry out a shock sowing campaign. The plan is to cultivate the large fields (corn, millet, sorghum, hemp fields) within fifteen days. And immediately sow sorghum, hemp, yam, corn, etc. (Cao Hanzhang)
