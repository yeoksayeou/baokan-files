    All-China Students' Federation Sends Congratulatory Letter
    [From Our Newspaper] The All-China Students' Federation sent a congratulatory letter to the National Youth Congress, stating in the letter: "We believe that this congress will point out a new direction for the Chinese youth movement. It will not only unite the youth and the people of the whole country to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang and thoroughly win the revolutionary war, but also mobilize and organize the strength of the youth to participate in the construction work in military, economic, political, and cultural fields, and build China into a completely independent and industrialized country, and defend world democratic peace together with the democratic youth and people of the world. We students are willing to study hard, cultivate ourselves, under the leadership of the soon-to-be-established All-China Democratic Youth Federation and with the help of our elder brothers and sisters, so as to participate in various construction works in the future. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will surely move forward on the road to victory!"
