    Zheng Wenhua's Transformation
    Worker at Shijingshan Power Plant, Xia Baoyi

    Zheng Wenhua, a lathe operator in the repair section of our plant, came to our company in 1945 during the period of the Japanese puppet regime. When he first arrived, he really worked hard, no doubt for the sake of having food. However, after only three months, his work completely changed. He was given a new lathe when he arrived, but he ended up damaging it. The chuck, headstock, bearing teeth, and tool rest were all rendered unusable. During the Kuomintang period, he would just loaf around or stand at the window looking outside during work hours. Sometimes, he would simply slip away during working hours. Because he was spineless and listless, he didn't care if he was scolded or hit a few times. He never fought with anyone. At that time, the workers had no choice but to let him do as he pleased. It would be better if he didn't work at all; if he did, he would only cause trouble. He could only turn two coal cart rollers a day, and sometimes not even one. Even if he did turn something out, the dimensions were never the same. He would ruin at least two pieces of material for every roller he turned, or the belt would break, or the tool head would snap. Therefore, everyone said, "This young man is finished! There's nothing that can be done about his lack of drive!"

    What did he enjoy at that time? It was going to gamble by pushing dominoes and playing mahjong after work, and "stealing" coal from the railway station every night to sell, which he then threw away in gambling. His monthly expenses were always not enough to pay his debts. He was single and earned as much as others, and he could "steal coal" to sell for money. In theory, he should have been more well-off than anyone else, right? However, he was burdened with debts on all sides. When payday came, at least five or six people would come to demand payment, and he would have no choice but to disappear with his salary without a trace, only to return after two or three days. He didn't even have a decent pair of pants, and sometimes he couldn't even get food to eat because his "reputation was so good" that the restaurants didn't dare to give him credit. Sometimes he relied on young friends to bring him food from their homes. He endured countless instances of hunger, several dismissals, and countless instances of creditors chasing him down and verbally abusing him, but he continued to live on spinelessly and listlessly. After the liberation of Shijingshan last December, firstly, the factory belonged to the people, and the workers became masters of their own destiny. Secondly, the People's Liberation Army was so kind to the workers and the people. These facts moved him. Thirdly, the Communist Party's political study raised his awareness, coupled with the daily meetings in our factory, which established a system of criticism, which prompted his transformation. Once, at a lathe operators' meeting, team leader Ma Binwen criticized him: "We're liberated, work hard. If you have any opinions, you can raise them, don't be like you used to be!" He immediately replied happily, "You don't need to tell me. From today onwards, you'll see my work." Everyone was excited to hear this. The team leader said, "Good! Since you said that today, I'll treat everyone to 100 yuan!" While everyone was eating peanuts and talking, he listened to everyone's advice with heartfelt sincerity. The next morning, Zheng Wenhua was working by the lathe as soon as he got to work, without resting for a moment, until he got off work. From then on, he really transformed. From turning only two coal cart rollers a day, he now turns fifty, increasing efficiency by twenty-five times. You might doubt this when you hear it. I tell you, it's definitely not wrong. From then on, he worked very hard and had no time to gamble. The people demanding payment disappeared, and his life was ten times better than before.

    In his work, he has also taken the lead. During the April production campaign, he was challenging every day. He finally found an opponent to compete with to make five hundred one-inch thick bolts for the coal pulverizer iron tiles. He ran to the iron furnace room and said: I'll take this job. He challenged Li Shuguang (also a young worker) to compete. Neither of the two young men was willing to give in, and they worked hard and fast. They turned eighty bolts in one day. According to the masters in the factory, if he had been given this job in the past, it would have taken him half a year, and who knows how many he would have ruined?

    郑文华的转变
    石景山发电所工人  夏宝义
    本厂修理股旋工郑文华，他是民国三十四年来到本公司的。那时还是敌伪时代，刚一来，的确工作很卖力气，不用说这是为了窝窝头问题。可是干没有三个月光景，工作完全变了。他来时给他一盘新旋床子，结果都叫他弄坏了，卡缶、车头、轴瓦牙齿轮及走刀架子，都给弄的没法使用。他在国民党时期，每天上班只有泡（磨洋工的意思）或是站在窗户上望外看景致。有时在工作时间干脆溜之大吉。因为他是没气没囊的人，骂一顿打两下，毫不介意，他从来没有和任何人打过架，在那时工人只好随他便吧，不干倒好，如果他干点活，反会出乱子啦。他一天只能旋两个煤车滚珠，有时还成天一个都不旋，即使旋出活，尺寸也没有一样，他旋一个滚珠，起码坏两个的材料，要不然皮带又断啦，刀头又截开啦，因此大家都说：“这小伙子一辈子算完啦！没气没囊真没办法！”
    那时他所好的是什么呢？就是下班后，找地方推牌九、打麻将、每日夜里在火车站“偷”点煤卖了，结果都扔到牌局里去了。他每月的开支总是不够还帐的，他是单身一人，挣钱和别人也不差啥，又能“偷煤”卖钱，按理说，他比任何人都宽裕吧？然而他倒弄的四方八面净是帐，一到发薪最少有五、六人跟他要帐，他只好望望薪金神不知鬼不晓的开小差了，等过三两天再回来。他连条富裕的裤子都没有，有时连饭都吃不上，因为他的“人缘太好”啦，饭铺都不敢赊给他，有时只靠青年朋友们就从家中给他拿点吃的。他经过多少次饥饿，经过几次被开除，经过没数次的要帐人的追逼辱骂，但他还是没气没囊的活下去。去年十二月解放石景山后，一来是工厂归为人民，工人当家作主。二来是解放军对工人百姓那样亲爱，种种事实感动了他。三来是共产党的政治学习，提高觉悟，加上本厂每日的碰头会，建立了批评制度，这就促使他转变了。有一次，旋工碰头会上，领班马斌文批评他：“解放啦，好好工作吧，有什么意见可以提出来，不要象从前那样啦！”他马上很愉快的回答：“不用你说，从今天起，你们看我的工作”。大家听了这句话都表示兴奋。领班说：“好！今天你既然说出这话来，我拿一百元请客！”大家一边吃花生米一边谈，他心悦诚服的听了大家的劝告，第二天早上一上班，郑文华就在床子旁干活，没有休息一时，直到下班。从此他真的转变了，从前一天他只旋两个煤车滚珠，现在旋到五十个，效率提高了二十五倍。这话大家听了也许会感觉怀疑吧。我告诉你，决没错。从此他在工作上很努力，没闲心赌钱，要帐的人也没有了，生活比从前好上十倍。
    他在工作中，更起了带头作用，四月份生产大竞赛，他每天在挑战，好容易他找到个对手，就是做煤粉机铁瓦一寸粗的螺丝五百个，他跑到铁炉房说：这活我包下啦。跟李树广（也是一位青年工人）挑战竞赛，二个青年小伙子，谁也不肯让谁，努力快干，一天就旋八十条，据本厂老师们说：这活要是从前给他干，半年就算下去啦，还指不定要损坏了多少个呢？
