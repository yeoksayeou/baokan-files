    The Ping City Qinghe Woolen Mill will vigorously repair its machines
    The Municipal Government Enterprise Bureau approves the factory's plan
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Municipal Enterprise Bureau yesterday (the 12th) continued to review and approve the Qinghe Woolen Mill's one-year production plan (May 1938 to April 1939). The factory plans to produce 24,192 meters of printing flannel, 32,256 meters of fine wool flannel, 70,560 cotton blankets, 196,000 yards of white cloth, and 228,480 yards of striped cloth throughout the year. In addition to timely repairs of damaged machinery (the factory was established a long time ago, and most of the machinery is damaged and needs repair), the factory's maintenance department also plans to vigorously renovate the workshops and offices, manufacture small machines (such as electric looms), and repair the factory's original brick press. All projects have undergone precise cost accounting and concrete steps for completing the tasks. At the Enterprise Bureau meeting, Comrade Hou Rutian introduced the factory's situation. After everyone's discussion, Director Mou summarized the meeting and put forward the following suggestions: (1) The factory should make a concrete plan regarding where to buy how much raw material and open up more sales channels to avoid capital accumulation that affects capital turnover. (2) According to the original plan, the cost calculation may be too high. Go back and calculate it more accurately to find the highest and lowest cost figures in order to place orders with various places. (3) Vigorously improve technology and the quality of woolen fabric. Also, allocate a portion of personnel to cultivate skills in order to lay the foundation for continuous improvement. (4) The factory's maintenance department should, based on existing technical conditions, manufacture more simple machines, and avoid making large and empty plans. Standards for the cloth should be set, maintain quality, and establish credibility. (5) The welfare section should also formulate plans for agriculture and sideline occupations for future inspection (the factory currently has more than 270 mu of both irrigated and dry land, as well as various sideline productions such as raising pigs, ducks, and bees).

    平市清河制呢厂将大力修理机器
    市府企业局批准该厂计划
    【本报讯】北平市企业局昨日（十二日）继续审查并批准了清河制呢厂一年的生产计划（三十八年五月至三十九年四月）。该厂计划全年生产印刷呢二四一九二公尺，细毛呢三二二五六公尺，棉毛毯七零五六零条，白布一九六○○○码，条布二二八四八○码。另该厂保全部除及时修理损坏机器（该厂建立甚久机器大部破损待修）外，亦拟大力整修工房及办公室，制造小型机器（如电动织布机等），修复本厂原存之压砖机等。各种工程都做了精确的成本核算及完成任务之具体步骤。在企业局会议上，由侯儒田同志介绍了该厂情况，经过大家讨论后，牟局长总合会议发言，提出如下几点意见：（一）要求该厂做出具体计划，在那些地方能买到多少原料，并多方开辟销路，以免积压资本影响资金周转。（二）根据原计划，成本计算可能过高，回去后再精确计算，求出最高和最低成本数字，以便与各处实行订货。（三）大力提高技术，提高织呢质量。并抽出一部人员大力培养，以便打下继续提高技术的基础。（四）工厂保全部要根据现有技术条件，多制出一些简单机器，不要做大而空的计划。要做出布的标准，保持质量，建立威信。（五）福利科在农业及副业上也要订出计划，以备将来检查（按该厂现有水旱田共二百七十余亩，另外尚有养猪、鸭，蜂等各种副业生产）。
