　　Experience in Organizing Waterwheels in Duyanggang, Xingtang, and Fanjiaping, Zhengding

　　One: Organize and everyone benefits

　　Too much land, too few wells, and even fewer waterwheels. In the past, during droughts, waterwheels were moved around, delaying their use. Some land couldn't be watered in time, and households without wells or waterwheels couldn't even get any water. This was a common phenomenon in both villages. Households without wells or waterwheels urgently requested that waterwheels be organized. Those with wells but no waterwheels, or those with waterwheels but no wells or insufficient animal power, also requested the organization of waterwheels. Even households with both wells and waterwheels were willing to organize waterwheels, because everyone benefits from organizing.

　　(1) Saving Waterwheels: Fan Buzi's and Fan Chouzi's waterwheels in Fanjiaping were made from the same tree in the same year. Fan Buzi's waterwheel was frequently dismantled and has been broken for several years, while Fan Chouzi's waterwheel is fixed and is still in use. Everyone is responsible for repairing the waterwheel, which can reduce the burden on the waterwheel owner.

　　(2) Saving Labor: Fan Wenhan of Fanjiaping said, "My family can save sixty workdays this year by not dismantling the waterwheel." Last year, the unorganized waterwheels in Fanjiaping wasted more than nine hundred workdays on dismantling and transporting. Duyanggang saved seventy-three workdays by organizing the waterwheels and reducing transportation.

　　(3) Improving the Efficiency of Waterwheels: After organizing the waterwheels, time is scientifically allocated, preventing them from being idle. In particular, the time spent each year dismantling and transporting can be used for watering, greatly increasing the effect. Secondly, after organizing, strong animal power can be equipped, increasing the rate of watering. Thirdly, combining several waterwheels to water a piece of land at the same time, the water flow is large and fast, and each waterwheel can water one more mu of land per day, saving one worker. In the past, some households in Duyanggang without waterwheels could not water in time, affecting their crops. This year, all the waterwheels in the village are organized, not only can the original 2073 mu of irrigated land be watered in time, but also 398 mu of dry land have been expanded for well irrigation. The 1070 mu of watered land in Fanjiaping can also be watered in time.

　　(4) Reducing Disputes: In the past, disputes often occurred over the use of waterwheels and wells, leading to disunity among the masses. After organizing, disputes have been reduced. In addition, since the organization of waterwheels, the allocation of manpower and animal power has also been organized accordingly.

　　Two: Appropriately resolve specific problems

　　Sixty-eight waterwheels in Duyanggang are organized, with fifty-eight fixed on fifty-eight wells, and ten mobile on eighteen wells. Before and after the organization of waterwheels in this village, the general public and waterwheel owners raised many questions:

　　(1) Questions raised at the beginning of the organization: The cadres of the 7th District of Xingtang first conducted a survey and learned that the waterwheels in Duyanggang were insufficient. When the district cadres proposed the issue of "organizing waterwheels" to the village cadres and the masses, the cadres and the masses all nodded in agreement, saying, "It's good, but I'm afraid it can't be organized." Everyone was afraid that the waterwheel owners would not agree. The cadres then found the waterwheel owner Han Luosheng to discuss the matter. He was very clear about this issue, saying, "My two waterwheels were bought at the same time a few years ago. One is fixed to a well and has been used for five years, and some of the buckets can still be used. Because my land for growing seeds is scattered, one is mobile and has only been used for three years, and half of it is broken. Dismantling a waterwheel costs two workdays. Dismantling and transporting the waterwheel back and forth is time-consuming and easy to break. It is better to fix the waterwheel on the well, which can water more land and save labor, and can also solve the difficulties of households without waterwheels." The waterwheel owners had no objections, so a meeting was held to discuss specific measures. The following opinions were raised at the meeting:

　　1. There is no well or waterwheel, and the land is not far from the well. Is it allowed to water it? 2. What about those who have waterwheels but no wells (waterwheels left when selling land) or those who have wells but no waterwheels? 3. What if there is no one or livestock, and the livestock cannot be rotated and must be interrupted during rest? 4. What if the land is separated and there is no waterway to water? 5. Who is responsible for repairing the waterwheel if it breaks? 6. Who gets the manure pulled by the livestock pulling the waterwheel?

　　After discussion, the decided solutions were as follows: 1. Educate waterwheel owners to change their old habits. As long as it does not affect the watering of the owner's land, others should be allowed to water. On the other hand, mobilize households without wells or waterwheels to use a well and waterwheel (with their own livestock) and repay a small workday (five small workdays per day) with manpower. If they cannot repay with labor, they should repay with money at a discount. 2. Those who have waterwheels but no wells can use the well water for free without affecting the well owner's use. 3. Those who have no livestock can borrow livestock and repay with labor. One donkey is worth two workdays, and one mule is worth three workdays. Everyone eats their own food. Cows that cannot pull waterwheels can be exchanged with donkeys that are used for plowing. Weak livestock can be pulled with the cooperation of manpower. If livestock workdays and manpower workdays are of different lengths, they should be compensated at the market price. 4. The cooperative is responsible for educating the landowners whose land is separated by waterways to leave waterways. 5. If the waterwheel breaks, each group is jointly responsible for repairing it, and the cost is shared according to the number of mu of land watered. If the damage is caused by lack of care, the person who caused the damage is solely responsible. 6. In principle, the manure pulled by the livestock pulling the waterwheel belongs to whoever owns the livestock.

　　At the same time, the form of organization was decided. Start by organizing groups, according to the amount of land, the distance of the wells, and the willingness of the masses. Each waterwheel is a group, with the waterwheel owner as the group leader. The number of households in each group depends on the condition of the well and the waterwheel. After the groups are organized, the group leaders will elect to establish a "Waterwheel Management Cooperative" to lead the allocation of waterwheels throughout the village.

　　(2) Problems that occurred in the three days after the organization: 1. Households using waterwheels are unwilling to apply oil, and no one repairs the buckets when another waterwheel breaks. The waterwheel owner is unwilling to let others use it anymore. 2. Two group leaders arranged the order of watering according to the distance of the land, without paying attention to the urgency of drought. The drought-stricken households complained, "This is not as good as using our own waterwheels!" 3. Three households without wells or waterwheels wanted to use water for free, causing dissatisfaction among others. 4. People shirked responsibility for dismantling waterwheels and did not take care of the waterwheels during dismantling. The waterwheel owners also raised opinions. After these problems occurred, the Waterwheel Cooperative immediately convened a meeting of group leaders to review the situation. Everyone felt that things were better after the organization than before. Ordinary livestock can water four mu of land per waterwheel per day, and good mules can water five mu. The following decisions were made regarding the problems that occurred: 1. Each waterwheel has an oil bottle and is oiled three times a day. The oil money is shared by each household in the group according to the number of mu of land watered. 2. Investigate the cause of the waterwheel breaking. If it breaks during normal use, the group will repair it. If it is damaged due to lack of care, the individual will repair it. 3. A waterwheel convention was established: Water the land that is drought-stricken first, everyone is responsible for taking care of the waterwheel, dismantling the waterwheel requires mutual assistance, and watering should also be done at night during droughts. Those without wells or waterwheels should repay with labor for using the water, etc. After these problems were resolved, work was resumed.

　　Fanjiaping has a total of nineteen waterwheels, fourteen fixed and five mobile. From the beginning, attention was paid to selecting good waterwheels to place on mobile wells. Each waterwheel is a group, and the nineteen groups are divided into four teams. The whole village organizes a waterwheel cooperative. Whoever has more land around the well uses whose waterwheel. For fixed waterwheels, the households that water the land pay 100 jin of rice to the waterwheel owner each year (the average fixed waterwheel in the village can water 47 mu, which is about 2 jin of rice per mu). For mobile waterwheels, each household that waters the land pays 150 jin of rice to the waterwheel owner each year (including the waterwheel owner's own land). Households without waterwheels or wells pay 4 jin of rice per mu per year to the waterwheel owner for repair costs. Whoever waters the land is responsible for getting the oil, to avoid damage to the waterwheel.

　　(3) Review from the leadership:

　　Zhengding had some experience in organizing waterwheels last year, but it is still a new task. The practice of conducting research and investigation first, then propaganda and mobilization, and timely resolution of various specific problems is very good. However, there are two issues that still need to be studied.

　　1. After the waterwheels are organized, attention should be paid to the issue of "mutual benefit" in order to consolidate them. Special attention should be paid to the interests of the waterwheel owners. Duyanggang originally planned that households without wells or waterwheels would use a well and waterwheel and repay five-tenths of a workday. Three days after the start, the situation of three households wanting to use water for free occurred. Repaying with labor or grain (as in Fanjiaping) is acceptable, but it must be guaranteed to be fulfilled. The principle of voluntary mutual benefit should be taken into account in every specific problem. For example, Duyanggang only proposed "education by the cooperative" on the issue of "land separated by waterways" borrowing waterways. This only took into account the interests of those who need water and did not take into account the land occupied by the waterway. If a certain area is occupied, a certain price should be given. All issues should have clear and specific regulations, and ambiguity will not last.

　　One cannot simply regard education and mobilization as the main methods, but should also take into account actual benefits.

　　2. In many places that can dig wells and install waterwheels, the land is still dry land due to the lack of wells or waterwheels, or the waterwheels are too few to water the crops, resulting in crop drought. It is necessary to promote the collective cooperative power of waterwheel cooperatives to dig wells, buy waterwheels, share the burden, and use them together, increasing the area of irrigated land.

　　行唐独羊岗、正定樊家庄
  　组织水车的经验
    一　组织起来大伙有光沾
    地多井少，水车比井更少，天旱时将水车东搬西搬，耽误着水车的使用，有些地不能及时浇水，有些没井没车的户甚至摸不着浇，这是两个村庄以往常有的共同现象。没井没车的户迫切的要求将水车组织起来，有井没车，有车没井或畜力不足的也要求组织水车，有井有车的户也愿把水车组织起来。因为组织起来大伙有光沾。
    （一）省水车：樊家庄樊不子和樊丑子的水车是同一年由一棵树的木料造的，樊不子的水车因常拆卸已经坏了好几年了，樊丑子的水车是固定的，到现在还使用着。修理水车大伙负责，水车主可以减轻负担。
    （二）省人工：樊家庄樊文山说：“我家今年不拆水车可以省六十个工。”樊家庄去年水车无组织来回拆卸搬运共多费多九百个人工，独羊岗的水车组织起来很少搬运便省下了七十三个人工。
    （三）提高了水车的效力：把水车组织起来之后，科学的分配着时间，不让他有白白歇着的时候，特别是将每年拆卸搬运的过程所占了的时间用来浇地，会增加很大效果的。其次是组织起来后，可以配备上很强的畜力，可增加浇地的速率；再次是将几个水车合起来同时浇一块地，水头大流的快，每天每架水车可多浇一亩地省下一个人工。独羊岗往年有些没水车的户不能及时浇，庄稼受到影响。今年全村水车组织起来了，不仅原有水浇地二○七三亩都能及时浇上，而且还扩大三九八亩旱地为井浇水，樊家庄水地一○七○亩，也都能及时全部浇好。
    （四）减少纠纷：往年常因使车使井发生争执，群众之间不团结，组织起来之后，纠纷减少了；此外由于水车组织起来后，人力、畜力的拨工也随之组织起来了。
    二　适当的解决具体问题：
    独羊岗六十八架水车组织起来，五十八架固定在五十八个井上，十架流动在十八个井上，这个村里的水车在组织之前和组织起来之后，一般群众及水车主都提出了许多问题：
    （一）开始组织时提出的问题：行唐七区的干部先调查好，知道独羊岗的水车不够用的情况，当区干部到村和村干部及群众中提出“组织水车”这个问题时，干部和群众都一致点头说：“好是好，只怕组织不起来”，大家都怕水车主不同意，干部们便找到了水车主韩洛生去商量，他对这个问题看得很清楚，他说：“我两架水车是前几年同时买的，一架固定到一个井上，使用了五年还有的斗子能使，因我养种的地分散，一架是流动的，只使了三年就坏了一半，拆卸一次水车用工两个，来往拆卸水车又耽误工夫又容易坏，不如固定水车在井上，多浇地又省工，也能解决没有水车户的困难。”水车主们没有意见了，就开会讨论具体办法，在会上提出了以下意见：
    １、无井无水车，地离井边又不远，是否准许他浇？２、有水车没井（卖地时留下的水车）有井没水车的怎么办？３、没人没牲口，牲口少换不过来，休息中间就要间断，怎么办？４、地隔地没水道不能浇怎么办？５、水车坏了谁负责修理？６、拉水车的牲口拉下粪归谁要？
    讨论后决定解决办法是这样的：１、教育水车户改变旧习惯，只要不影响本主浇地，应准许别人浇，另方面动员无井无车的户使一天井和水车（自己的牲口）用人力还一个小工（每日五小工），不能还工，折价还钱。２、有水车没井的在不影响井主使水时，可以白使井水。３、没有牲口的可以借牲口还人工，一个驴顶二个人工，一个骡子顶三个人工，个人吃个人的。不能拉水车的牛，可以和用着耕地的驴调换用，弱牲口可以人力配合着拉，牲口工和人工有长短时，齐工时按市价找补。４、由合作社负责教育隔住水道的地户留出水道。５、水车坏了由各组共同负责修理，按所浇地亩数分担。如果是因不加爱护而损坏者，由损坏者一人负责。６、拉水车时拉的粪，原则上规定谁的牲口粪归谁。
    同时讨论决定了组织形式，先从组织小组着手，按地多少、井的远近和群众自愿去组织，每架水车一个组，由水车主当组长，每组户数多少，看井与水车的好坏决定。由组长掌握浇地次序与管理水车，各小组组织起来之后，由各组长推选建立“水车管理合作社”，领导全村的水车拨工。
    （二）组织起来三天中发生的问题：１、使水车的户不愿上油，另一水车坏了斗子没人修理，水车主不愿再叫别人使了。２、有两个组长是按地远近排列浇水先后，不注意被旱的缓急，受旱户提出：“这还不如自己使自己的水车呢！”３、没井没水车的三户想白使水，引起别人不满。４、拆卸水车互相推诿且拆卸时不爱护水车，车主也提出意见。这些问题发生后，水车合作社当即召集组长会议检讨，大伙都感到组织起来后比以往好啦，普通牲口每天一架水车能浇四亩地，好骡子能浇五亩。对发生的问题决定：１、每架水车有个油瓶，每天搞三次油，油钱按全组各户浇地亩数分担。２、水车坏了追究原因，一般的使用坏了，组里修理，不爱护损坏了个人修理，３、定了水车公约：那块地旱先浇那块地，大家负责爱护水车，拆卸水车要互助，天旱时晚上也要浇，没井没水车的使了水还工等。这些问题解决之后，又继续拨起工来。
    樊家庄全村共有十九架水车，十四架固定，五架流动，一开始便注意了挑出好的水车来放在流动井上，每架水车为一个组，十九组分为四个队，全村组织一个水车合作社，以井为单位周围谁家地多使谁的水车，固定的水车，每年由浇地户交纳米一百斤，（全村的固定水车平均起来每架能浇四十七亩，每亩地亦合二斤米左右）流动水车由各浇地户每年纳米一百五十斤给车主（水车主自己地亩也算在内），没车没井的户，每亩每年纳四斤米交给车主作修理费，谁家浇地谁家搞油，以免水车损坏。
    （三）从领导上检讨：
    组织水车正定去年就有些经验，然仍是个新工作，先调查研究后宣传鼓动，及时解决各项具体问题，这种作风是很好的；但是有两个问题，还须加以研究。
    １、水车组织起来之后，要使之巩固应注意“两有利”的问题。要特别注意到水车主的利益。独羊岗原计划没井没水车户使了一天井和水车，还五分之一个人工，开始三天后，就有三户想白使水的事情发生。还工、掏粮食（如樊家庄）都可以，但必须保证兑现。每个具体问题上都应照顾到自愿两利的原则，如独羊岗对“地隔地”借水道问题，只提出“由合作社教育”这就只注意了需要水的这方面的利益，对水道占地则未照顾到。如果占了一定面积是应给予一定代价的。一切问题应有明确具体的规定，糊糊涂涂是不能持久的。
    不能单纯的把教育动员当成主要办法，还应照顾到实际利益。
    ２、许多能够打井按车的地方，因没井或水车，现在还是旱地，或者水车少浇不过来，使庄稼受旱的现象尚普遍存在。用水车合作社集体合作的力量去打井买水车，共同负担共同使用，增加水面积地，可普遍推行。
