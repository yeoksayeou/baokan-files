Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: The Kuomintang bandit gang is issuing large-denomination Jin Yuan notes with face values of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 in its remaining areas of control in order to cruelly exploit the people. It is reported that the 500,000-denomination notes began circulating in Chongqing and other places on the 16th, and the million-dollar notes have also been printed. Merchants in Dihua went on strike on the 15th to protest the use of the fake 50,000 and 100,000-denomination Jin Yuan notes. Because the Jin Yuan notes have become worthless paper, Kuomintang civil servants in various places have refused to accept them. Kuomintang civil servants in Guilin and Lanzhou returned the Jin Yuan notes salary issued by the fake Central Bank to the fake Central Bank, causing many agencies to come to a standstill. Markets in Fuzhou and other places have implemented a barter system, and the lives of citizens are in desperate straits.

　　国民党匪帮发行百万大钞
    【新华社北平十九日电】国民党匪帮又在其残余统治区发行十万、五十万、一百万之票面的金圆券大钞，用以残酷剥夺人民。据息：五十万票面大钞已于十六日开始在重庆等地流通，百万之大钞亦已印就。迪化商民因拒用五万，十万元票面伪金元券，曾于十五日罢市。因金元券已成废纸，各地国民党公务员都已拒绝领用。桂林、兰州国民党公务人员将伪中央银行发给的金元券薪饷原封退回伪中央银行，许多机关因此陷于停顿状态，福州等地市场已实行物物交换，市民生活陷绝境。
