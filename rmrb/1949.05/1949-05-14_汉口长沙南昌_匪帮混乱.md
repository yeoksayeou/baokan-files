    Hankou, Changsha, Nanchang
    Bandit Gang Chaos
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th] According to various sources: Under the victorious advance of the powerful People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule in Hankou, Changsha, Nanchang, and other places has fallen into complete chaos. Two-thirds of the shops in Hankou have closed, and not a single rice shop remains open. Many newspapers have ceased publication. Most of the officials of the puppet Central China Military and Political Office have fled south to the Duyang, Lingling, and Quanxian areas bordering Hunan and Guangxi. The puppet provincial government has fled to Enshi. The bandit Wuhan Garrison Headquarters announced on the 7th that Hankou had entered a state of war, and promulgated murderous articles such as "those who incite strikes, work slowdowns, and class boycotts will be sentenced to death." On the same day, the bandit army blew up the bridges north of Hankou along the Pinghan Railway. Due to the congestion of military transportation, the Hankou Railway Administration announced that the Yuehan Railway would suspend passenger transport from the 10th. Cheng Qian's Changsha Pacification Headquarters is preparing to flee to Weiyang. The bandit gangs are intensifying their plunder of the people. The puppet provincial government ordered 49 counties including Changsha and Hengyang to "borrow" 1.5 million dan of grain before the end of May. Nanchang has become a dead city, all shops are closed, most of the Kuomintang officials have fled, and the People's Liberation Army's Eight Points of Attention are circulating among the citizens.

    汉口长沙南昌
    匪帮混乱
    【新华社北平十三日电】据各方消息：在强大人民解放军的胜利推进下，国民党匪帮在汉口、长沙、南昌等地的统治已陷于完全混乱。汉口三分之二的商店已经关门，米店更关得一家不剩，许多报纸已经停刊：伪华中军政长官公署大部官员南逃湘桂交界处都阳、零陵、全县一带，伪省府已逃往恩施。匪武汉警备司令部于七日宣布汉口进入战时状态，公布了“煽动罢工、怠工及罢课者处死刑”等杀条，匪军并于同日将汉口以北沿平汉路的桥梁炸毁。由于军运充塞，汉口铁路管理局宣布粤汉路自十日起停止客运。程潜的长沙靖绥公署已准备逃往卫阳。匪帮们正加紧搜刮人民，伪省府勒令长沙衡阳等四十九县于五月底前“借”粮一百五十万担。南昌已成死城，商店全部关门，国民党官员大部逃走，人民解放军的约法八章在市民中流传着。
