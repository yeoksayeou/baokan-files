    Taiyuan Telegram: The working class of Taiyuan demonstrated high enthusiasm and awareness during the battle to liberate Taiyuan, as well as in the takeover, repair, and restoration work, enabling Taiyuan, which had suffered severe damage from the Yan clique, to quickly resume work. On the evening of April 20th, when the People's Liberation Army on the northern route crossed the Yan clique's fortress complex and advanced south, the civilian stretcher teams did not have time to keep up with the troops, and the workers of the steel plant in the north of the city automatically organized themselves to rescue the wounded. Worker Wen Kangzhong from that plant carried stretchers all night without rest. When the PLA's weapons broke down, the mechanics of the Industrial Section worked overtime to repair them. When the PLA arrived at the Jinhua Cigarette Factory in the south of the city, the workers boiled water for the troops amidst the flying shells. Wang Zaxi, an employee of the boiler room of the East Factory (Jinhua Cigarette Factory, divided into East and West factories), delivered artillery shells to the front line for three days. Jiang Kailu volunteered to be a guide for the attacking troops. After the liberation of the Jinfeng Flour Factory in the south of the city, workers such as Li Xinrui risked carrying water to put out the fire when it was hit by artillery fire from the Yan bandits in the city. When the PLA launched the city assault on the 24th, the workers of the Northwest Printing Factory organized themselves to guard the machine rooms and warehouses, burying flammable materials such as gasoline and kerosene underground. When the warehouse of the factory was hit by artillery shells, Fan Dazeng and other workers rescued machinery and materials in the midst of the explosions to prevent loss, demonstrating the working class's love for state property. When the takeover personnel arrived at the factory, all employees reported and assisted in the takeover. The Northwest Telephone Factory, Oxygen Factory, and Northwest Cement Factory, among others, were able to prevent the Yan bandits' sabotage plots from succeeding due to the entire staff sticking to their posts and doing their best to protect them, and all the machinery in the factories remained intact. On the second day after the liberation of Taiyuan, Lai Ruoyu and Hu Yaobang, deputy directors of the Military Control Commission, Kang Yonghe, director of the Taiyuan office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, and others, personally visited the factories to express their regards to the workers and solicit their opinions. The Military Control Commission also distributed more than 60,000 jin of grain to the workers of each factory to temporarily maintain their livelihoods. The morale of the city's workers is rising, and they are rushing to repair damaged parts in preparation for resuming work early. Although the Northwest Steel Plant was damaged by the Yan bandits' artillery fire, destroying the fourteen-inch underground water pipe of the waterwheel section and the iron rails of the high car, it had already begun to resume work on the evening of the 26th due to the active repairs by the workers. The two largest chemical factories in Taiyuan, the Northwest Electrochemical Factory and the Oxygen Factory, fully resumed work on the 27th and began producing finished products.

    太原各工厂职工
    战斗中英勇护厂  接管后积极复工
    【太原电】太原市工人阶级在解放太原的战斗中，接管、抢修、恢复工作中，表现了高度的热情和自觉，使遭受阎匪惨重破坏的太原得以迅速复工。四月二十日晚间，北路解放军越过阎匪堡垒群向南挺进，民工担架队没有来得及跟上部队，城北的炼钢厂工人就自动的组织起来抢救伤员。该厂工人温康中抬了一夜没有休息。解放军的武器打坏了，工务科机工系赶工修理。当解放军到达城南晋华卷烟厂时，工人们在炮弹飞舞中给部队烧开水，东厂（晋华烟厂分东西两厂）锅炉房职工王咋喜给火线上送了三天炮弹，姜开禄自告奋勇为进攻部队当向导。城南晋丰面粉厂解放后，被城内阎匪的炮火打着起火工人李新锐等冒险担水抢救。二十四日解放军发动攻城战斗时，西北印刷厂的职工便组织起来，看守机房仓库，把容易着火的汽油、煤油等埋到地下。樊大增等四个工人于该厂仓库中了炮弹时，在爆炸中抢救机器物资，防止遗失，表现了工人阶级对国家财富的爱护，接管人到达该厂时，全体职工报到，协助接管。西北电话厂、氧气厂、西北洋灰厂等，均因全体职工严守岗位，尽力保护，阎匪破坏阴谋未能得逞，全厂机器完整无缺。太原解放后的第二天，军管会副主任赖若愚、胡耀邦、华北职工总会太原办事处主任康永和等，亲到各工厂慰问职工，征询工人意见。军管会并以六万余斤粮食，分发各厂职工，暂时维持生活。全市职工情绪愈益高涨，纷纷紧急抢修残件，准备提早复工。西北炼钢厂虽被阎匪炮火打坏了水车部地下十四英寸水管和高车铁轨，但由于工人积极抢修，二十六日晚已开始复工。太原市最大的两个化学工厂——西北电化厂和氧气厂已于二十七日全部复工，开始制造成品。
