　　Floating Bridge Across the Yellow River's Perilous Natural Barrier

　　As the million-strong People's Liberation Army marched south from North China, racing towards the Yangtze River, the first large floating bridge in history appeared on the Yellow River. Forty-four large Yellow River boats were linked together by thousands of ropes. The ropes, like the warp threads on a loom, were tightly tied to countless wooden stakes on the sandy beach, pulling and holding this 1,500-meter-long floating bridge. Under the May sunshine, cheering crowds, jubilant yangko dance troupes, and loudspeakers broadcasting Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's marching orders, inspired the heroes who had liberated Tianjin and Beijing, marching in neat steps from under the archway that read "Victorious Crossing of the Yellow River, Liberate All of China" onto this newly completed Yellow River floating bridge.
　　On both sides of the floating bridge stood the soldiers of the Fourth River Defense Detachment. These heroes of the river had, under the orders of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek when he ordered the breaching of the Huayuankou dike in an attempt to flood the Jilu Yu liberated areas, braved enemy bombing and strafing day and night to repair the dikes. They had also, in the second half of 1947 when the People's Liberation Army switched to the offensive, ferried Liu Deng's and Chen Su's armies to annihilate the Kuomintang bandit troops. Now, when the million-strong, modernly equipped southbound army was stalled by this three-mile-wide torrent, they once again used their wisdom and resolved to create a historical miracle on the Yellow River. The soldiers declared war on the Yellow River with indescribable enthusiasm, fighting the waves day and night. They first built a two-mile-long road on the shallow shoals of the south bank of the Yellow River, drove countless wooden stakes on both banks, and hauled in large quantities of planks and millions of catties of sorghum stalks from hundreds of miles away. After two months of intense labor, they finally paved a large road across the rolling Yellow River.
　　The soldiers of the field army stepped onto the wide, flat, and resilient floating bridge, paying tribute to these water heroes with smiles. The army leaders presented them with flags and thanked them. The soldiers responded with applause and cheers.
　　But things did not go smoothly. Just after the vanguard division had passed, a sandstorm suddenly swept in at noon, breaking several ropes of the floating bridge. Four soldiers quickly steered a small boat to repair it, but the boat was overturned by the raging waves. Three soldiers quickly climbed onto the edge of the boat, but the fourth was washed over the floating bridge and drifted east with the rapid current. The soldiers on both banks quickly raised white sails and chased after him in the water for two or three miles before rescuing him.
　　One night, unexpectedly, before the rainy season arrived, the river suddenly rose by two feet, and the current shifted from the north bank to the south bank, eroding the shoals of the south bank. The road, the roadbed paved with sorghum stalks and sand, was constantly eroded by the rapid current. Units who had heard of the danger hundreds of miles away raced day and night to arrive, hoping to cross the south bank before the bridge broke. When they arrived at the riverbank, filled with doubt, they saw that the bridge had been repaired again. [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd]

　　横跨黄河天险的浮桥
    白刃
    当百万人民大军从华北兼程南下，迅速进军江南的时候，黄河上出现了历史上的第一座大浮桥。四十四条黄河大船被千百根缆绳连在一起。缆绳象织布机上的经线一样，紧紧地绑在沙滩上的无数木桩上，牵曳着这一道长达一千五百米达的大浮桥。在五月的阳光下，夹道欢呼的人群，狂欢狂舞的秧歌队，扩音器播送着的毛主席朱总司令的进军命令，鼓舞着解放平津的英雄们，迈着整齐的步伐，从“胜利渡黄河，解放全中国”的牌楼下走上了这座刚刚竣工的黄河浮桥。
    浮桥两侧排列着河防第四大队的水兵。这些河上的英雄们，曾经在蒋贼指使花园口堵口、企图水淹冀鲁豫解放区的时候，日夜冒着敌机的轰炸扫射抢修过黄堤，他们也曾经在一九四七年下半年人民解放军转入进攻时摆渡过刘邓大军和陈粟大军去歼灭国民党匪军。如今，当成百万的现代化装备的南下大军被这三里多宽的汹涌急流阻滞行程的时候，他们又运用自己的智慧，决心创造黄河上的历史奇迹。水兵们用难以形容的热情向黄河宣战，日日夜夜和波浪搏斗着。他们首先在黄河南岸的浅水滩上修了一条两里长的大道，在两岸打下无数的木桩，从百十里路以外拉来大批木板和几百万斤秫秸，经过两个月的紧张劳动，终于铺成了一条横在滚滚黄浪上面的大马路。
    野战大军的战士们踏上宽阔平坦而有弹性的浮桥，用微笑向这些水上英雄致敬。部队首长向他们献旗致谢。水兵们则用掌声与欢呼回答着。
    但是事情并不是一帆风顺的。前卫师刚刚过去，晌午忽然卷起黄土漫天的大风，浮桥的几根缆绳被风刮断了。四个水兵赶紧架着小船驰去抢修，小船却被恶浪打翻了。三个水兵急忙攀上船缘，第四个已被波浪冲过浮桥，顺着激流向东飘去。两岸的水兵们急忙扬起白帆，在水中追了两三里路，才把他救了起来。
    在一个夜里，出乎意料之外，在这雨季来临之前，河水突然猛涨了两尺，急流从北岸转向南岸，冲刷南岸的滩上，大道，垫铺着秫秸和沙土的路基不断被急流冲刷着。在百里以外惊闻险讯的部队日夜兼程赶来，想在桥断以前赶过南岸。当他们惊疑不定地来到河边，都看见这座大桥又修好了。【新华社汉口二十二日电】
