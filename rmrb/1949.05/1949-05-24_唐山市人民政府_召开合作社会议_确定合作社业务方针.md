　　Tangshan Municipal People's Government
  　Convenes Cooperative Meeting
  　Determines Cooperative Business Policy
    [Tangshan Electricity] In order to develop future cooperative work, the Tangshan Municipal People's Government convened a cooperative meeting on the 19th, attended by responsible persons from various financial and economic departments, military representatives from various factories and mines, representatives from trade unions, and responsible persons from cooperative societies of various factories and mines. The meeting pointed out that Tangshan is an important industrial city in North China, with a total of over 200,000 workers and their families, accounting for two-thirds of the city's population. In order to avoid price fluctuations and ensure that workers' actual wages are not affected, it is extremely important to develop employee consumer cooperatives. In the past, although individual cooperatives were established in factories and mines in Tangshan, they were unsound in terms of policy and business, and should be re-transformed. Therefore, in view of the existing problems of the employee cooperatives in Tangshan, the meeting pointed out the direction for running cooperatives in the future: (1) We must follow the mass line, overcome the style of acting as an agent, replacing, forcing, and ordering. The organization should be democratically elected by the members themselves; (2) Mass participation in the cooperative and purchase of shares, and withdrawal from the cooperative and return of shares must be completely free, overcoming the phenomenon of apportioning shares in some cooperatives in the past; (3) The foundation of the cooperative must be built on democratic centralism, and business plans should be formulated according to the actual needs of the members; (4) Oppose the profit-sharing route of consumer cooperatives; (5) Do not do business with non-members to avoid generating profit-making ideas. In order to adapt to the actual situation in Tangshan and facilitate workers to sell coal tickets, flour tickets, and cement coupons, the cooperative can also engage in purchasing and sales operations. With the assistance of national trade agencies, consumption should be organized in a planned manner to better serve employees. All state-owned trade agencies, banks, and postal and telecommunications bureaus should provide cooperatives with ample materials and loans in supporting and helping the development of cooperatives.

　　唐山市人民政府
  　召开合作社会议
  　确定合作社业务方针
    【唐山电】唐山市人民政府为开展今后的合作社工作，特于十九日召集各财经部门负责人，各厂矿军事代表，职工会代表及各厂矿合作社负责人举行合作社会议。会议指出：唐山市为华北重要工业城市，工人及其家属共二十余万，占全市人口的三分之二。为避免物价波动，保证工人实际工资不受影响，故发展职工消费合作社极为重要。过去唐山各厂矿虽个别成立了合作社，但在方针业务上均不健全，应重新改造。因此会议针对目前唐山市各职工合作社存在的问题，指出今后办合作社的路线：（一）必须走群众路线，克服包办、代替、强迫、命令的作风。机构要由社员自己民主选举产生；（二）群众入社入股，退社退股必须完全自由，克服过去部分合作社摊派股金的现象；（三）合作社的基础必须建立在民主集中制上，根据社员的实际需要，制定业务计划；（四）反对消费合作社的分红路线；（五）不做非社员买卖，避免产生营利观点。为着适应唐山市的实际情况，便利工人出售煤票、面票、洋灰券，合作社可兼做收买运销业务。在国家贸易机关协助下有计划地组织消费，更多地为职工服务。各国营贸易机关、银行、锐局，均应在扶植与帮助合作社的发展上，供给合作社充裕的物资和贷款。
