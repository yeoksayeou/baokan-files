On the Soviet proposal to restore German unification, Acheson quibbles and defends, while Schuman and Bevin parrot.

Following Vyshinsky's speech, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson spoke next. Acheson continued to oppose the Soviet proposal aimed at restoring German unification. Acheson reiterated his statement from the previous day, insisting that the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German State Council was a "step backward." Regarding the Soviet proposal to restore the Control Council, Acheson did not affirm that the Control Council should not be restored at all, but argued that the control issue should be placed after the resolution of the German unification issue. Acheson further suggested first discussing all economic issues, which, according to the following explanation, boils down to merging the eastern Soviet occupation zone into the western three-nation joint occupation zone.

French Foreign Minister Schuman spoke next, largely repeating Acheson's statement, as he had done the previous day.

In contrast to Acheson and Schuman, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in his speech, acknowledged that the restoration of the Four-Power Control was possible, as long as its functions were changed and limited. However, he simultaneously suggested using the Washington Agreement, signed separately by the three Western powers, as a model. Bevin said: "I believe that if the Eastern Zone joins the agreement on the Three-Power Control, and if we agree to limit Allied Control to security issues, then we have a good chance of reaching an agreement." Regarding the issue of German economic and political unification, Bevin proposed letting "the Germans themselves" decide, explaining that he meant suggesting that the whole of Germany emulate the "example" of the Western occupation zones. Although everyone knows that the division of Germany caused by the Western powers is completely inconsistent with the wishes of the people in the Western occupation zones of Germany, which the U.S., Britain, and France claim to have "consulted."

### 对苏联恢复德国统一建议　艾奇逊犹图狡辩　舒曼贝文鹦鹉学语

　　对苏联恢复德国统一建议
  　艾奇逊犹图狡辩
  　舒曼贝文鹦鹉学语
    在维辛斯基发言之后，美国务卿艾奇逊继之发言。艾奇逊仍然继续坚持反对苏联旨在恢复德国统一的建议。艾奇逊再次重复他前一天所作的声明，硬说苏联成立全德国务会议的建议是“倒退一步”。关于苏联的恢复管制委员会的建议，艾奇逊没有肯定管制委员会完全不应该恢复，但他却主张管制的问题放在解决德国统一问题之后。艾奇逊进而建议首先讨论全部经济问题，而这些问题，照下列解释，归结起来就是将东方苏联占领区并入西方三国联合占领区。
    法外长舒曼相继发言，在很大程度上重复艾奇逊的声明，象他在前一天所作的一样。
    与艾奇逊及舒曼相反，英外相贝文在其发言中承认恢复四国管制是可能的，只要改变和限制它的权能即可。但是，他同时建议以三个西方国家单独签订的华盛顿协定为范本。贝文说：我认为，如果东占区加入关于三国管制的协定，如果我们协议把盟国管制限于安全问题，那么，我们是有充分可能达到协议的。关于德国经济与政治统一的问题，贝文提议让“德国人自己”决定，他解释说，他的意思是建议整个德国仿效西占区的“榜样”。虽然谁都知道，西方国家所造成的德国的分裂，完全不符合美、英、法说是和他们“商量”了的德国西占区人民的愿望。
