　　Italian Agricultural Workers' Strike Expands
    Following the strike of 600,000 agricultural workers in northern Italy on the 18th of this month, it expanded to over a million in just two days, by the 20th. Most importantly, the strike area has expanded from the north to the center and south. The Italian labor movement, consistently under the unified guidance of the Communist and Socialist parties, continues to grow stronger. Especially after the failure of Saragat's right-wing sabotage of the labor movement, the entire Italian working people have consolidated their unity and are persisting in their struggle to win living and working rights! In this agricultural workers' strike, the reactionary government and the Landowners' Association have spared no effort in sabotage, but neither armed suppression and murder, nor covert injuries, softening tactics, and division can make the agricultural workers bow their heads! Vittorio's prediction is being realized: "If the landlords stubbornly refuse all demands for contract revisions and daily wages, the agricultural laborers engaged in united struggle nationwide will be forced to hold a general strike!"

　　意农业工人罢工扩大
    意大利北部农业工人于本月十八日六十万人罢工之后，仅两日的时间，至廿日已扩展至百万以上，最主要的是罢工地区已自北部扩至中部和南部。意大利的工运始终在共社两党的统一指导下继续壮大发展，特别是在萨拉盖特右派破坏工运阴谋不逞之后，全意劳动人民巩固地团结起来，为争取生活及工作权利而坚持斗争！这一次农业工人大罢工中，反动政府及地主联合会的破坏是不遗余力的，但无论其为武力镇压枪杀，或为暗伤软化分裂，均不能使农业工人低头！维特里奥的预言是正在实现着：“如果地主顽固地拒绝一切修改合同及每日工资的要求，正在全国范围内进行联合斗争的农业劳工，将被迫举行总罢工！”
