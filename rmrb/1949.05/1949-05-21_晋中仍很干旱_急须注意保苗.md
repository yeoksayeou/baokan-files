　　Jinzhong is still very dry
  　Urgent attention needed to protect seedlings
    [Jinzhong Telegram] For the past half-month, the counties under Jinzhong's jurisdiction have still not received soaking rain, and the drought is becoming increasingly severe. In Yu County, due to early attention to combating drought and planting, most of the major autumn crops have now been sown. Eighty percent of the crops planted are expected to sprout, while twenty percent have been affected by the drought and wind. In Pingyao County, attention to combating drought and rushing to plant came later, and only about 35 percent of the autumn fields have been sown so far. Villages in the three districts (six, seven, and eight) that benefit from the Fen River water conservancy project are irrigating approximately 170,000 mu of land, and the villages are vigorously cultivating the land. In the districts south of the Tongpu Railway, cotton is being planted by carrying water, everywhere. Although the county experienced two rainfalls earlier this month, the rainfall was not significant and not widespread. Most villages did not receive even an inch of rain. Many of the dryland wheat seedlings planted last year in the newly cleared wasteland are already yellowish-white or even withered. Seedlings in autumn fields planted earlier are also very dry, and urgent attention is needed to protect the seedlings.

　　晋中仍很干旱
  　急须注意保苗
    【晋中电】半月来晋中所属各县仍未落透雨，旱象日益严重。盂县对抗旱播种因及早重视，现在大秋作物大部播种完毕，所种作物有百分之八十可以捉苗，百分之二十因天旱刮风已受影响。平遥县对抗旱抢种注意较迟，迄今下种之秋田仅达百分之三十五左右。六、七、八三个区享受汾河水利村庄，约计浇地十七万亩，各村正在大力耕种。同蒲路以南各区普遍担水点种棉花，月初该县虽落雨两次，但雨量不大，且不普遍，大部村庄受雨未及一寸。去年在新区消灭荒地所种之旱地麦苗，已有不少呈白黄色，甚至枯干，下种较早之秋田，幼苗亦甚旱干，急需注意保苗。
