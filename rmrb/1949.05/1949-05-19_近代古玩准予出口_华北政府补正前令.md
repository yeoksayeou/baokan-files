　　Modern Antiques Approved for Export
　　North China Government Corrects Previous Order
　　[Report from this newspaper] The North China People's Government previously issued an order prohibiting the export of antiques in order to preserve ancient cultural relics from being lost. Now, considering that antique exports have always occupied a significant position in the import and export trade of Peiping and Tientsin, and to clarify the scope of the prohibition on antique exports, a new order was issued on the 17th of this month stipulating that, with the exception of antiques with historical value which are prohibited from export, modern products of no historical value are permitted for export. The North China Foreign Trade Administration and the Tianjin Customs are authorized to organize specialized agencies to identify exportable antiques.
