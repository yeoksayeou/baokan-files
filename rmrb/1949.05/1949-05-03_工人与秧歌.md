Workers and Yangge
Guidance Group of the North China People's Art Troupe

After the liberation of Beiping, all arts from the liberated areas gradually followed the People's Liberation Army into the city, developing and deepening. Since the performances of "Chi Yehe," "The White Haired Girl," "Blood and Tears of Hatred," and some smaller programs, it has been proven that these programs and forms are welcomed and liked by the working class and the broad masses of the people. However, the content lacks works that express the life of the working class. This is not only what the working masses demand, but also what literary and artistic workers in the city feel and strive for now and in the future.

In the short months in Beiping, the popularity of Yangge has been quite rapid. But what are the working class's views and attitudes towards Yangge? How well do they accept it? When we were teaching Yangge at the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' recreational training class, we gathered more than sixty worker comrades from twenty-six work units and conducted a survey. We asked each of them to write an article with the title "Your Views on Yangge." We received more than thirty papers, which provided us with some very good information.

Under the rule of the Kuomintang, the working class had no access to cultural entertainment. Even if there was, it was some kind of improper entertainment. For example, one worker wrote, "Because I had no entertainment before, I feel healthier and eat more after dancing Yangge." Another wrote, "We use it for entertainment and can get rid of bad habits." When workers first learned Yangge, they felt that it was a proper form of entertainment and exercise. This was mentioned in many articles.

During the Kuomintang rule, some workers had improper views of Yangge from the liberated areas, which must be attributed to the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda. One female worker believed such rumors as "Dancing Yangge is for the Eighth Route Army to watch, and Yangge is their exclusive property." Another female worker said, "It is so unsightly for a girl to dance like this, it lacks any decorum." But after a few days of learning, they had a completely new view. They realized that this Yangge dance has a long history in our Chinese folk culture and is a beneficial exercise. In the future, we should improve and elevate it, so that this mass entertainment can be more widely promoted.

Yangge is an art form that meets the needs of the masses. It is not only liked by the liberated peasants, but also a popular art form for workers. As one worker said, "Everyone is willing to learn" and it is "easy to learn." "It is a folk art," but the Communist Party has transformed it, adding new content, and it has become a proper form of entertainment and can further play a role in educating the masses.

Yangge is a folk art that originated from the labor of peasants. It is a noble entertainment for the laboring masses. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are one family, so isn't it the same for us workers to dance something from the peasants? Therefore, it "is our literature and art, it is the song and dance of our laborers." Therefore, workers value Yangge, and Yangge can truly express the inner joy and excitement of the workers.

The most important task for the workers, who have turned over and become the masters of the new China, is to step up production and support the front lines. That is to say, it is a question of how to combine Yangge art with politics. Workers believe that Yangge is the easiest art form to educate workers. It can encourage production enthusiasm, improve work efficiency, and enrich workers' lives. It is an art of collective activity. Through the singing and dancing activities of Yangge, the power of worker solidarity can be strengthened.

Facts have proven that after the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan, during the victory celebrations, Yangge was not only an art loved by students and citizens, but also an art that expresses the inner joy of the working class and is loved by the broad masses of workers.

    工人与秧歌
    华北人民文工团辅导组
    北平解放后，解放区的一切艺术逐渐的跟随解放军的入城流转、开展和深入着。自从“赤叶河”，“白毛女”，“血泪仇”和一些小的节目演出后，证明这些节目和形式是被工人阶级和广大人民所欢迎所喜好。然而内容上却缺少表现工人阶级生活的作品，这一点不仅是工人群众所要求，同时也是在都市中的文艺工作者们所感受到和现在和未来所努力的一个目标。
    在北平短短的几个月中，秧歌的流行是相当迅速的。但工人阶级对秧歌的看法和态度是些什么呢？他们的接受程度如何？我们在市总工会文娱训练班及教他们学秧歌时，我们召集了二十六个职工单位的六十几个工人同志，举行了一次测验，发动他们每人写一篇稿子，题目“你们对秧歌的看法”，交卷的有三十余篇，在这些稿子中提供了我们一些，很好的资料。
    在国民党统制下的工人阶级是谈不到什么文化娱乐的，即使有也是一些不正当的娱乐。比如有的工友写着“因本人素无娱乐，扭了之后，身体健康，增加饮食”。更有的写着“我们拿它作娱乐，可以改掉坏习惯”。工人们最先学会秧歌时，就感觉秧歌是一种正当的娱乐和运动，关于这一点在许多篇文章中都提到。
    在国民党统制时曾有些工人对解放区的秧歌是有着他们不正当的看法，这不能不归罪于国民党反动宣传。一个女工曾相信这样的谣言“扭秧歌是给八路军看的，秧歌是他们的专用品。”还有一个女工说：“一个女孩子这样扭是多么难看，一点体统也没有”。但经过了几天的学习后，他们就有着一种完全新的看法。他们认识了这种秧歌舞在我们中国民间有很长的历史，是一种有益身体的运动，以后再把它加以改善、提高，使这种群众性的娱乐更普遍的发扬光大起来。
    秧歌是适合群众要求的艺术形式，它不仅被翻了身的广大农民所喜好，也同样是工人所喜闻乐见的艺术形式。如有的工人认为是“大家乐意学习”，并“容易学会的”。“它是一种民间艺术”，但是共产党把它加以改造，加上新的内容，就成了正当的娱乐，并进而能起到教育群众的作用了。
    秧歌是从农民劳动中产生的一种民间的艺术，它是劳苦大众的高尚娱乐，工农兵既是一家，那么我们工人扭一扭农民的东西还不是一样吗？因此它“是我们的文艺，它是我们劳动者的歌舞”。因此，工人们才把秧歌重视起来，秧歌也真能表现工人内心的愉快和兴奋的情绪。
    翻身后做为新中国主人的工人们，最主要的任务是加紧生产和支援前线，也就是说秧歌艺术如何和政治结合的问题了。工人们认为秧歌是教育工人最易深入的一种艺术，它可以鼓励生产情绪，提高工作效率，丰富工人生活，它是一种集体活动的艺术，通过扭秧歌的歌舞活动，能够加强工人团结的力量。
    事实证明，这次南京太原解放后，在庆祝胜利的狂欢中，秧歌不仅是广大学生和市民所喜爱的艺术，同时也是表现工人阶级内心欢乐并被广大工人所喜爱的一种艺术。
