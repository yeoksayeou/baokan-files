    The Third Day of the North China Workers' Congress
    Discussion of Comrade Li Zaiwen's Report
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 4th) was the third day of the North China Workers' Representative Conference. All the delegations spent the entire day in group discussions. The representatives, organized by enterprise type and system, focused on Comrade Li Zaiwen's report on "The Current Tasks of the North China Workers' Movement," particularly emphasizing the several issues that must be resolved in restoring and developing industrial production in North China. They connected these issues with the specific circumstances of various regions and enterprise units, raising questions and studying solutions to serve as a practical basis for the conference's resolution of problems. The discussions covered a wide range, such as the democratization of management in state-owned enterprises; the composition, powers, and working methods of factory management committees; the division of labor and working relationships between factory administrations, factory management committees, trade unions, and workers' representative conferences; how to guarantee workers' real wages during price fluctuations; and how to solve workers' welfare issues as much as possible. Furthermore, discussions also touched upon how factories should formulate production plans under the new circumstances brought about by the liberation of the entire North China region, and how to correctly implement the policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital" in private enterprises, as well as the ideological trends of both labor and capital. As of press time, group discussions were still ongoing.
