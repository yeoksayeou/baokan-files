　　The Jiaozuo to Xinxiang section of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway was opened to traffic on the 14th of this month. On the third day after the liberation of Xinxiang, the railway takeover team organized the existing railway workers and actively prepared for repair work. More than 300 employees officially started working on the repair of the railway and the repair of locomotives and carriages. After a week of hard work, in addition to connecting more than ten miles of track south of the station, three turnouts were laid in the station. A Jiaozuo train loaded with equipment, grain, and coal entered Xinxiang at 6:10 PM on the 14th. The No. 1135 2-8-0 type locomotive that was being repaired was also quickly completed. In order to welcome the locomotive out of the depot, the workers repaired the road to the locomotive depot overnight, and the locomotive was driven out of the depot this morning. When the repaired locomotive drove onto the re-laid rails, the workers of the locomotive section and the engineering section cheered for the restoration of their railway.
