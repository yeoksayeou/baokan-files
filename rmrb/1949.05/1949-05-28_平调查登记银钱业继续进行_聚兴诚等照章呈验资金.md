　　Continuing the Survey and Registration of Banks and Money Shops in Beiping

　　Juxingcheng and Others Present Capital for Inspection According to Regulations

    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 27th), Juxingcheng, United Commercial Bank, Beiping Commercial Bank, and four money shops, Tongyuanxiang, Fushunde, Renfagong, and Chunhe, continued to register with the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China. Among them, Juxingcheng, Tongyuanxiang, Fushunde, Beiping Commercial Bank, and Chunhe have submitted half of their required capital to the bank.

    In addition, Datong Bank has applied for liquidation due to the Shanghai head office's inability to maintain operations. Zhengtai Bank's business has also stalled.

    [Another Report] Yesterday (the 27th), the Gold Management Section of the bank continued to investigate the business of various banks and money shops, including: Housheng, Wanchang, Yongtaigong, Yuchanghou, Fushunde, Zhenda, Hengtai, Baosheng, Derunxing, Yiju, Dadetong, Jixing, Renfagong, Renchang, Baofengsheng, and Quanjuhou, a total of fifteen.

    [Our Newspaper] In view of the fact that some credit-poor and financially weak banks and money shops in this city will voluntarily close down during the registration process, the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China is currently drafting specific measures for the closure and liquidation of banks and money shops for ease of handling, and will announce and implement them in the short term.

　　平调查登记银钱业继续进行
  　聚兴诚等照章呈验资金
    【本报讯】平市私营银钱业昨日（二十七日）继续有聚兴诚、联合商业、北平商业三银行及同元祥、福顺德、仁发公、春和等四钱庄向中国人民银行北平分行进行登记，其中聚兴诚、同元祥、福顺德、北平商业、春和等五家已将应缴之半数资本金呈缴该行。
    另外，大同银行因上海总行无力维持，已呈请停业清理。正太银行业务亦陷停顿状态。
    【又讯】该行金管科调查各行庄业务工作昨日（二十七日）继续进行，计调查有：厚生、万长、永泰公、裕长厚、福顺德、振大、恒泰、宝生、德润兴、义聚、大德通、济兴、仁发公、仁昌、宝丰盛、全聚厚等十五家。（宇）
    【本报讯】人民银行北平分行鉴于本市银钱两业进行登记过程中，将有少数信用较差，资力薄弱者自行停业，为便于处理起见，现正草拟银钱业歇业清理具体办法，于短期内公布实行。
