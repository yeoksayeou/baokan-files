　　Economic Terms Explained
    Daily Renewal

    Inflation is the phenomenon where the amount of currency in circulation exceeds the amount needed by society. Before World War I, most countries' currencies were mainly coins, so inflation was not very common except in countries with fiscal disorder or when certain countries occasionally increased issuance to stimulate production. However, since the beginning of the war, due to the enormous wartime expenditures, countries mostly resorted to increasing the issuance of paper money to cope with fiscal deficits, and inflation became a widespread phenomenon. The German Mark and the Russian Ruble during World War I are the most prominent examples. During World War II, even countries with superior economic conditions like the United States could not avoid increasing issuance. The Kuomintang's excessive issuance of legal tender and gold yuan notes in China was particularly malignant inflation. The result of inflation is the devaluation of currency, leading to domestic price increases and external exchange rate drops, causing confusion in the national economic relations, especially payment relations, and severely affecting the distribution of social income. In countries experiencing war, this is an unavoidable phenomenon.

    Deflation is the reduction of currency in circulation, the complete opposite of inflation. Its impact on society and the economy is also the opposite of inflation, leading to a drop in prices. While it benefits financial capitalists, creditors, and salaried workers, it is detrimental to industrial capitalists. Excessive deflation can easily lead to industrial decline, economic panic, and evolve into wage cuts and unemployment. The reason for implementing deflation is generally to remedy the various ills caused by inflation, so this policy is mostly used as a passive and reactive measure for post-crisis management. After the war, various countries implemented contractionary monetary reforms, but except for the Soviet Union, which achieved the expected results, few other countries succeeded.

　　经济名词解释
    日新
    通货膨胀是流通货币的数量超过了社会通货需要量的现象。在第一次世界大战以前，各国的货币大部以硬币为主，所以除了财政紊乱的国家常常发生这种情况，以及某些国家常为刺戟生产偶尔增加发行数字之外，通货膨胀的事情并不太多。但从大战开始以后，由于战时开支的浩繁，各国大都以增发纸币来应付财政赤字，通货膨胀就成了各国普遍的现象。第一次大战中德国的马克、俄国的卢布即其最显著的例子：第二次世界大战中虽经济条件优越如美国也不免增加发行，在中国国民党的滥发法币和金元券尤为恶性通货膨胀。通货膨胀的结果是因货币贬值形成对内的物价上涨和对外的汇价跌落，使国民经济关系特别是支付关系陷于混乱，而社会的所得分配关系也受到严重的影响。在战争情况的国度中，这是一个不可避免的现象。
    通货紧缩　流通货币缩小，和通货膨胀是完全相反的现象。在经济的社会的影响上也和通货膨胀相反，形成物价的跌落；对金融资本家、债权者、薪金生活者虽有利，但对产业资本家则不利。如过度紧缩，则容易引起产业萎退经济恐慌，演变为减薪失业等情形。实行通货紧缩的原因一般地是为了挽救因通货膨胀而生的种种恶果，所以这个政策大抵是消极的被动的作为善后政策来用的。大战后各国都实行过紧缩性的货币改革，但除了苏联得到预期的成绩之外，其他国家成功的很少。
