Schools in Beiping Should Continue to Strive
Establish Learning Order

[Our Newspaper] The Beiping Municipal Education Bureau yesterday (the 16th) convened a meeting of principals and deans of public secondary schools in the city to discuss student relief funds for poor students and further establish learning order in schools. First, Liu @, Director of the Education Bureau, explained the revised relief fund measures stipulated by the Education Bureau on the 14th, and sought opinions from the principals and deans of various schools. After a full exchange of views, it was believed that student relief funds must be re-examined, and the amount of relief funds should be graded in the future according to the different economic conditions of students' families. When talking about the order of the schools, the schools reflected that after liberation, some students misunderstood liberation as meaning no rules and freedom, and some students participated in too many extracurricular activities, resulting in considerable chaos in middle schools. For example, Municipal No. 5 Middle School had no schedule, no system for requesting leave, and no roll call in class. Some students in the Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School did not attend classes for several weeks. After the Municipal Education Bureau took over, the order was initially stabilized and the chaos was eliminated after enlightenment education in various aspects, but learning has not yet been well on track. For example, one school, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, jointly established a community with four middle schools outside the school, leaving little time for learning; some mischievous students in some schools did not abide by classroom order, thereby destroying the learning atmosphere of their classmates. In addition, the establishment of private associations among students hinders the establishment of the entire collective life within the school. After heated speeches, it was unanimously agreed that to further establish school order (including life and learning), students should be educated in a planned and step-by-step manner on the basis of conscious voluntarism. Students who seriously disrupt discipline should be punished. Extracurricular activities should be carried out without hindering regular class learning. Under the current circumstances, extracurricular activities should be resolutely reduced, and efforts should be concentrated on developing learning. One middle school principal also proposed the article published on the fourth page of this newspaper on the 16th by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on primary and secondary school students participating in extracurricular activities as learning material and theoretical basis. In order to cultivate students' collectivist spirit, the decentralized small community activities should be gradually guided into class-based centralized activities.

　　平市各校仍应努力
  　建立学习秩序
    【本报讯】北平市教育局昨（十六）日召集本市公立中等学校校长和教导主任座谈清寒学生救济金和进一步建立学校秩序展开学习的问题。首由教育局长柳＠说明十四日教局所重新规定的救济金办法，征求各校校长及教导主任的意见。经充分交换意见后，认为须重新审核学生救济金，根据学生家庭经济情况的不同，决定今后救济金将分等级。谈到学校的秩序问题时，各校反映解放后一部分学生误解解放为没有规则，自由散漫，一部分学生过多地参加了课外活动，以致中学校相当混乱，如市立第五中学没有作息时间，请假没有制度，上课没点名。市立第二女中部分学生几星期不上课。市教育局接管后，经过各方面的启发教育，初步安定了秩序和消灭了混乱现象，但学习还不有很好的走上轨道。如女二中一个学校就与校外四个中学共同建立社团，没有多少时间来学习；一部分学校有些调皮学生不守上课秩序，以至破坏同学学习空气。此外，又如学生私人间成立了社团，他们的个别活动妨碍了学校内整个集体生活的建立。经过热烈的发言，一致认为要进一步建立学校秩序（包括生活和学习），要有计划有步骤地教育学生在自觉自愿的基础上进行。对于那些严重破坏纪律的学生，应该加以处罚。课外活应动在不妨碍正课学习下进行，目前情况下则应坚决减少课外活动，集中力量开展学习。一位中学校长并提出本报十六日四版所登联共中央关于中小学参加课外活动的一篇文章为学习材料和理论根据。为培养学生们集体主义精神，应逐渐诱导分散的小社团活动转入班级集中活动。
