Jizhong Electric: The state-owned Longchang Store in Jizhong is vigorously supporting the production of mat weaving in the water towns, resolving sales problems and the livelihood difficulties of mat weavers, and driving 55 villages to organize reed supply and marketing cooperatives. In the disaster areas of Baiyangdian and Wen'anwa, the masses mainly rely on weaving mats for a living. Since this spring, production has increased, but sales have been sluggish, with no one buying. In order to support the production of mat weavers and maintain reasonable profits from weaving, the state-owned Longchang Store vigorously purchases mats and appropriately raises mat prices, stabilizes grain prices, and suppresses reed prices, providing various conveniences to the mat weavers. From January to April this year, a total of 372,041 mats were purchased, with an average profit of three jin of corn per mat, and the mat weavers received a total of 1,116,123 jin of corn. The store also collaborated with local governments and cooperatives to organize reed cooperatives. In April, a total of 75,350 mats were purchased, with a profit per mat higher than the market price by eleven liang of corn, and 11,230 mats of reeds were supplied to the cooperative at low prices. The masses feel that by organizing, they can sell the mats in a timely manner and obtain higher profits. Currently, there is a widespread mobilization to organize cooperatives, with 55 villages already organized. To open up sales channels for the mats, Longchang has sent people to Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Botou and other places to set up mat stalls, so as to circulate funds, enabling them to purchase and sell, and promote the better development of the mat weaving industry.

　　隆昌商店扶助灾民发展席业
    【冀中电】冀中国营隆昌商店大力扶助水乡席业生产，解决销路与席民生活困难，并带动了五十五个村组织起席苇供销合作社。白洋淀文安洼两地灾区群众主要靠织席为生，今春以来产量增多，但销路不畅，无人收购。国营隆昌商店为扶植席民生产，保持织席适当利润，即大力收席，并适当提高席价，稳定粮价，平抑苇价，给席民以各种便利。自今年一月份到四月份，共收席三十七万二千零四十一片，每片席子平均保持三斤玉米利润，席民共得玉米一百一十一万六千一百二十三斤。并协同当地政府及合作社组织席苇合作社，四月份共收席七万五千三百五十片，每片席利润高于市价十一两玉米，并低价供给合作社一万一千二百三十片席的苇。群众感到组织起来即能将席及时售出，又能得到较高利润，现正普遍发动组织合作社，已组织起的有五十五个村。为打开席子销路，现隆昌已派人到天津、北平、张家口、石家庄、泊头等地设销席摊，以便周转资金，能收能销，使织席业得到更好的发展。
