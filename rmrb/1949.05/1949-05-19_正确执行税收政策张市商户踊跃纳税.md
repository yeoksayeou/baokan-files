[Chahar News] The Zhangjiakou City Tax Bureau began collecting business tax for February and March of this year, and merchants enthusiastically paid their taxes. Collection began on the 10th of this month and is expected to be completed by the 20th. By the 14th, 90% of the tax due had already been collected, totaling 37.7 million yuan. The main reasons for this rapid collection are: First, a widespread and in-depth publicity and preparation campaign was conducted; and second, the tax policy of favoring industry over commerce was correctly implemented. Regarding the tax burden, some merchants, due to personal relationships, shielded each other during the assessment process, resulting in some imbalances and irrationalities in the burden between different trades and businesses. The People's Government is preparing to make reasonable adjustments. (Shu Chun)

　　正确执行税收政策张市商户踊跃纳税
    【察哈尔讯】张家口市税务局开征本年二、三月份营业税，各商户踊跃缴纳。从本月十日开始征收，预计二十日完成，到十四日即完成应征税额的百分之九十，计缴款三千七百七十万元。此次征收迅速的主要原因是：首先进行了普遍深入的宣传酝酿工作；在执行中又正确地贯彻了工业轻于商业的税收政策。在税收负担量上，由于在评定中，有些商户打不破情面，相互包庇，发生了行与行、户与户的某些负担不平衡不合理的毛病。人民市政府将准备进行合理调整。（树椿）
