　　Unified Liquor Monopoly in the Entire North China Region (Part 2)
    The liquor monopoly had been implemented in the North China Liberated Areas for years during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It could both reduce grain consumption, guarantee military and civilian food supplies, and increase financial revenue, alleviating the people's burden. In 1942 and 1943, when the Japanese invaders were carrying out cruel mopping-up operations against the entire North China region, the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, and insects. The area of the disaster-stricken region was unprecedented, and the people suffered great hardship. At that time, in addition to the strict practice of frugality by the party, government, army, and civilians, and the consumption of wild vegetables and grass roots, the burning of grain for liquor was strictly prohibited, and even persimmon cakes, black dates, and red dates were prohibited from being used for brewing. It cannot be denied that this was a powerful measure to overcome the famine.
    My North China region was originally a historically famous liquor-producing area. Dong'a and Yanggu in Ji-Lu-Yu, Hengshui in South Hebei, Changzhi and Tunliu in Taihang and Taiyue, Rongcheng and Xushui in Central Hebei, and Shacheng in North Yue all abundantly produced liquor. The annual output of the entire region was about 150 million jin or more. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, according to investigations, the annual liquor production along the Beining-PingSui railway line and in the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin alone reached 49 million jin, requiring approximately 130 to 140 million jin of grain raw materials. If calculated according to the 4 million population of Beiping and Tianjin consuming 1.2 jin of grain per person per day, it could supply them for more than a month. Extrapolating this to the entire region, the grain used for burning liquor in North China each year is probably over 400 million jin. Consuming such a huge amount of grain for winemaking should be said to be a great waste. Especially in large cities such as Tianjin and Beiping, the supply of grain and industrial raw materials has added new tasks for us to develop industrial production, which requires saving the necessary and possible grain to supply the cities. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a liquor monopoly.
    The purpose of the liquor monopoly is to save grain and increase financial revenue. North China has entered a new period of construction, and supporting the front line and production construction require money everywhere. The burden on farmers is already very heavy, and it cannot and should not be further increased. Urban industry and commerce are recovering, and their ability to bear burdens is also limited. The liquor monopoly has a large profit, which does not harm integrity. Grasping this profit in the hands of the state can relatively reduce the burden on farmers, workers, and businesses, which is beneficial to the entire people's economy.
    The North China People's Government has promulgated the liquor monopoly regulations and instructed the financial and tax departments to establish specialized agencies to operate it. All party, government, military, and academic personnel in our region, as well as people from the industrial, agricultural, commercial, and academic sectors, should support this decision and implement this decree.

### 华北全区酒类专烧专卖（二）

　　华北全区酒类专烧专卖（二）
    酒类专烧专卖，华北解放区在抗战期间已实行有年，既可减少粮食消耗，保证军需民食，又可增加财政收入，减轻人民负担。一九四二及一九四三两年，正当日寇对我华北全区进行残酷扫荡时，原晋冀鲁豫解放区曾遭受了水旱虫等灾。灾区面积之大是空前的，人民受了极大困苦，当时除党政军民厉行节约，采野菜食草根外，严禁粮食烧酒，即连柿饼黑红枣等，亦加以禁酿，对渡过灾荒，不能不说是一种有力措施。
    我华北区原为历史上有名酿酒之区，若冀鲁豫之东阿、阳谷，冀南之衡水，太行太岳之长治、屯留，冀中之容城、徐水，北岳之沙城，均盛产酒。全区年产约在一亿五千万斤以上。平津解放以后，据调查仅在北宁平绥沿线暨平津两市，每年产酒即达四千九百万斤，所需粮食原料，约在一亿三、四千万斤左右。如果按北平天津两市四百万人口每人每天食粮一斤二两计算，可供月余食用，以此推算全区，我华北每年用之于烧酒的粮食，当在四亿斤以上。消耗如此巨量粮食于造酒，应该说是很大的浪费。尤其天津北平等大城市，为开展工业生产，粮食与工业原料的供应，又给我们增加了新任务，这就需要把必需与可能的粮食节约出来供给城市。所以实行酒的专烧专卖，是必要的。
    酒类专烧专卖，其目的在于节约粮食与增裕财政收入。华北已进入新的建设时期，支援前线和生产建设在在需钱，农民的负担已经很重，已不能也不应该再加重了，城市工商业正在恢复，负担能力也有一定限度，酒类专烧专卖，利润很大，取不伤廉，把这种利润掌握在国家手中，可以相对减少农工商业负担，对整个人民经济是有好处的。
    华北人民政府颁布了酒类专卖办法，并责成财政税收部门设立专门机构经营，我全区党政军民学各机关人员以及工农商学各界，应该拥护这个决定，执行这个法令。
