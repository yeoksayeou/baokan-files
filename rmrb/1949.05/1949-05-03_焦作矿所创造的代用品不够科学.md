To the Editor:

    Regarding the article "Jiaozuo Mine Creates Substitutes" published in the People's Daily on March 30th, an engineer from the Radio Equipment Factory here believes it is not scientific enough. He said: "Low-voltage transformers can use filtered soybean oil as a substitute for transformer oil, and it should be inspected frequently, taking care that it does not turn into a gel. Because once it becomes a gel, it will not conduct alternating current, and the transformer will burn out. As for high-voltage transformers, soybean oil cannot be used at all." The above opinions are for your reference or to be forwarded to the mine.

    焦作矿所创造的代用品不够科学编辑同志：
    三月三十日人民日报所载焦作矿创造代用品一稿中，据这里无线电器材厂一个工程师谈，认为不够科学。他说：“低压的变压器可以用滤过的豆油代替变压器油，并且要常常检视，要当心变成胶状。因为成了胶状后就不会交流，结果变压器要烧坏了。至于高压的变压器，则根本不能使用豆油。”以上意见供你们或转该矿参考。
