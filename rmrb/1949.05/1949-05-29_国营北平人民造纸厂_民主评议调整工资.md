　　State-Run Beiping People's Paper Mill
  　Democratic Appraisal Adjusts Wages
    [Our Dispatch] The State-Run Beiping People's Paper Mill has completed the adjustment of its unreasonable wage structure through a month-long study and discussion led by the takeover team and the trade union. Before the adjustment, the wage system at the People's Paper Mill had extremely unreasonable aspects. The Kuomintang bandit gang greedily exploited the workers, excessively suppressing wages; the highest-skilled workers only received the equivalent of 288 catties of millet per month. Egalitarianism in wages was also very serious: ordinary technicians received 240 catties per month, while some ordinary female workers and apprentices received as much as 205 catties. Furthermore, there were obvious injustices: for example, Zhao Xueqian, a tea server with light work, received 242 catties per month; while Zhang Yide, a warehouse laborer with the heaviest labor intensity, received only 205 catties per month. Technician Xin Gengxue, with better skills, received 247 catties per month; another technician, Xia Qingquan, whose skills were not as good as Xin Gengxue, received 259 catties. In addition, there were no clear regulations regarding working hours and apprenticeship periods within the factory. Since the liberation of Beiping, after the factory was taken over by the People's Government, workers demanded the reform of the above unreasonable phenomena. After investigation and research, the takeover team accepted the workers' demands and began studying the wage adjustment issue in mid-April. Using the wage standards of general small factories in Tianjin and Beiping as a reference, along with wage standards from the old liberated areas, and considering the nature of work, technical conditions, and labor intensity of each production unit, a draft wage adjustment plan was formulated and submitted to higher authorities for review. Subsequently, a joint meeting of the takeover team, the trade union, and representatives from various production units was convened to study the draft in detail before submitting it to higher authorities for approval. During the meeting, it was discovered that most workers misunderstood the wage adjustment as a universal and equal increase in wages. Detailed explanations were immediately given, and education on wage policies was conducted. Subsequently, a wage evaluation committee was formed, consisting of the takeover team, the trade union, heads of various departments, and worker representatives. The committee, based on the draft and each individual's technical skills, labor intensity, work attitude, and length of service, evaluated and adjusted wages one by one for each production unit, including ironworkers, electricians, boilermakers, and carpenters from the mechanical and electrical department, and papermakers, pulpers, and digester operators from the papermaking department. The evaluation committee then re-evaluated the results in cooperation with the head of each unit, and finally submitted them to the unit for discussion. If there were objections, they were studied; if there were no objections, the decision was finalized. On May 26, the evaluation of each unit was completed; on May 27, a general evaluation meeting was convened, involving the trade union, the heads of each unit, and worker representatives, and a resolution was made. On May 28, a general meeting of all employees was held, the adjustment results were announced, and the results were approved by the general meeting. In this way, the past unreasonable wage system was fundamentally resolved, stipulating that the highest-skilled worker's wage would be 445 catties and the lowest-skilled worker's wage would be 205 catties. Workers with good technical skills but low wages were appropriately increased, while those with poorer skills but high wages were appropriately reduced. Because wages in the factory had been universally low in the past, most workers received appropriate increases, with fewer cases of no change or reductions. Clearer regulations were also made regarding worker grades, working hours, and the apprenticeship system, based on specific circumstances. Some incorrect ideas among the workers were overcome during the adjustment process, and the workers' awareness was raised a step further.

　　国营北平人民造纸厂
  　民主评议调整工资
    【本报讯】国营北平人民造纸厂存在之工资不合理部分、一个月来，由接管组、职工会领导全体工人研究讨论，现已调整完毕。人民造纸厂的工资制度在未调整前，曾存在着极不合理的现象。国民党匪帮贪婪的剥削工人，过度的压低工资；最高技工每月实得工资才二百八十八斤小米。工资中的平均主义也很严重：如普通技工每月二百四十斤，而普通女工、学徒，最高工资也有二百零五斤者。此外还有显著的不公：如茶役赵学谦，工作很轻，每月工资二百四十二斤；而仓库劳力工人张一德，劳动强度最大，每月却只二百零五斤。技工辛庚雪技术较好，每月工资二百四十七斤；另一技工夏清泉的技术不如辛庚雪，却是二百五十九斤。此外，厂内工作时间、学徒期限，均无明确规定。自北平解放，该厂为人民政府接管后，工人即要求改革上述不合理现象。接管组经过调查研究，接受工人要求，于四月中旬着手研究工资调整问题。以平津一般小型工厂的工资标准，参照老解放区的工资标准，再根据各生产单位的工作性质、技术条件、劳动强度等情况，制订工资调整草案，送交上级审核后，即召开接管组、职工会与各生产单位代表联席会议，详细研究该项草案，再送交上级批准。会上发现大多数工人误解调整工资为普遍的平均提高工资，随即作了详尽解释，进行了关于工资政策的教育。随即由接管组、职工会、各部门主管人员及工人代表组成评资委员会，由机电科之铁工、电工、锅炉、泥木工，造纸科之纸机、打浆、蒸煮等各生产单位根据草案和每个人的技术条件、劳动强度、工作态度、工龄等，逐一评议调整；再由评委会分别协同该单位主管复评，最后交给该单位讨论，有意见提出研究，无意见即算定案。五月二十六日各单位评定完毕；二十七日召集职工会及各单位主管人与工人代表进行大会总评，作出决议；二十八日召开全体职工大会，宣读调整结果，并经大会通过。这样，过去不合理的工资制度基本上获得解决，规定最高技工工资四百四十五斤，最低技工二百零五斤。对技术条件好而工资低的工人予以适当增加，技术较差而工资高者予以适当减低。因过去该厂工资普遍低，故这此多数工人工资均有适当增加，不动与减低者较少。对工人等级与工作时间、学徒制度等，均根据具体情况作了比较明确的规定。工人中某些不正确思想，在调整过程中随时得到克服，工人的觉悟提高了一步。
