　　[Chahar News] To rectify the order of industry and commerce in the city and to eliminate speculators disrupting the market, the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the "Business License Measures" promulgated by the North China People's Government, carried out the registration of private industry and commerce in April, which will be completed by the end of the month. A total of 2,498 households applied for registration and were issued business licenses. In the past, the various private industrial and commercial factories and shops in Zhangjiakou City had a chaotic mix of industries, and speculation and mutual exclusion were quite serious, which not only failed to maintain legitimate profits within the industry, but also seriously harmed the national economy. This issuance of licenses strictly defined the business scope of each industry. The general merchants responded well. Because the implementation of specialized lines of business is of great benefit to the development of legitimate industry and commerce. (Cui Bing'an)

　　张垣整顿市场登记私营工商
    【察哈尔讯】张家口市人民政府为了整顿市内工商业秩序，杜绝奸商捣乱市场，根据华北人民政府颁发的营业证办法于四月分进行了私营工商业登记，月底可全部结束。计申请登记及发给营业证者共二千四百九十八户。过去张市各私营工商厂店，行业混乱不清，投机、互相排挤现象相当严重，不但不能维持行业中的正当利润，危害国民经济也很严重。这次发证，严格划分了各行业的营业范围。一般商人反映良好。因实行专行专业后，对正当工商业的发展是有很大好处的。（崔炳安）
