The People's Bank of China Provisional Regulations for Current Savings Deposits
(Promulgated April 20, 1949)

	I. Purpose: In order to serve the people and facilitate savings deposits and withdrawals, this Bank is establishing current savings deposits.

	II. Amount: The minimum amount to open an account is 100 yuan, with no limit on the maximum amount.

	III. Term: This type of deposit is designated for three terms: one month, two months, and three months. Deposits can be made at any time and any number of times within the agreed-upon term. However, withdrawals are limited to once every half month. Before the deposit matures, each withdrawal cannot exceed half of the current balance, and the principal and interest are withdrawn in full upon maturity.

	IV. Interest Rate: For one month: monthly interest rate of 5%; for two months: monthly interest rate of 5.5%; for three months: monthly interest rate of 6%. No interest will be calculated for accounts closed in less than one month. For withdrawals made before the maturity date of one month or more, interest will be calculated according to the Bank's current deposit interest rate. Interest will be calculated once a month on the 20th of each month, and interest accrued after the 20th will be included in the calculation for the following month.

	V. Procedures: When opening an account, the Bank will issue a passbook as proof. Those who need to use checks will be issued checks separately and must provide a specimen signature. When withdrawing, the passbook must be presented, and a withdrawal slip must be completed. Those using checks must issue a check and sign or stamp it with a signature or seal that matches the original specimen signature before payment can be made. Those who do not wish to provide a specimen signature can withdraw based on the passbook. However, the depositor shall be responsible for any disputes arising from loss. If there is any discrepancy in the registered amount in the passbook, the Bank must be notified immediately for verification and correction. No unauthorized alterations are allowed.

	VI. Negotiable Instruments: For those depositing via negotiable instruments, a seal must be placed on the back of the instrument. The amount of this instrument can only be withdrawn and accrue interest after it has been collected. If the instrument is returned, the Bank will immediately cancel the amount. The original instrument should be retrieved by the depositor according to the withdrawal procedures.

	VII. Loss Reporting: If a depositor loses their passbook, check, or seal, they must immediately report the loss to the Bank and publish a statement in a newspaper designated by the Bank. After three days, if there are no disputes, a guarantor can be found to apply for a replacement passbook, check, and a new seal. The Bank shall not be responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals made before the loss is reported.

	VIII. The Bank may revise the interest rate provisions and matters not covered in these Regulations at any time.
