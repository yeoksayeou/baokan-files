    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. The People's Liberation Army peacefully liberated Datong, a strategic military town in northern Shanxi, on the 1st. More than 13,000 Kuomintang troops laid down their arms and left the city to designated locations to be reorganized. With this, the entire Shanxi province is liberated. During the Pingjin Campaign last winter, Datong was already surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. However, the Kuomintang troops defending the city consistently refused to resolve the Datong issue peacefully. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the defending troops still attempted to break through and escape, but failed. The Kuomintang commanders of the defending troops, Yu Zhenhe, Tian Shangzhi, and others, had no choice but to send representatives to request a peaceful resolution from the People's Liberation Army. The people had long resented the long-term resistance and various crimes against the people committed by the Kuomintang troops in Datong. However, for the sake of the overall interests of the people, the People's Liberation Army still adhered to the spirit of lenient treatment towards all Kuomintang troops willing to give up resistance and accept reorganization, and allowed them to lay down their arms and be reorganized. On the 29th of last month, the People's Liberation Army entered the city's northern railway station, and on the 2nd, entered the city to take over defense. After the peaceful resolution of Datong, the people of the city were overjoyed. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, the people cheered along the streets, and their emotions were very enthusiastic.

    我军开入大同接防
    国民党军万三千人出城改编
    市民欢腾热烈迎接人民解放军
    【新华社北平四日电】人民解放军于一日以和平方式解放山西北部军事重镇大同，国民党军一万三千余人全部放下武器，离城开赴指定地点接受改编。山西省至此全部解放。在去冬平津战役中，大同即为人民解放军所包围。但国民党守军始终拒绝以和平方式解决大同问题，太原解放后，该守军仍企图突围逃窜。后以不逞，该守军指挥官于镇河、田尚志等不得已，乃派代表向解放军请求和平解决。大同国民党军长期顽抗及种种残害人民之罪行，早为人民所痛恨。惟解放军为整个人民利益着想，仍本对一切愿意放弃抵抗，接受改编的国民党军宽大处理的精神，准予放下武器，予以改编。上月二十九日，解放军即开入城北车站，二日，入城接防。大同和平解决后，该城人民无不欢腾。解放军入城时，人民夹道欢呼，情绪十分热烈。
