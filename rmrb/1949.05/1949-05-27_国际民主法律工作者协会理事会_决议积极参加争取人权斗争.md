Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th. Moscow dispatch: The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers (formerly translated as the International Association of Democratic Lawyers) held a meeting in Paris last month. According to Comrade Te Ding, head of the Soviet delegation and Deputy President of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, who has returned here, the Council meeting decided to hold the Fourth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Italy (location undecided) in late September. The Congress will discuss issues such as the confirmation of international treaties as a necessary condition for international peace and cooperation, the rights of people in affiliated countries and colonial countries, and the struggle against instigators of new wars. The Council meeting passed a resolution to actively participate in the struggle for civil rights and human rights, and decided to send representatives as observers to the trial of the leaders of the American Communist Party currently being held in the United States.

Furthermore, the Democratic Association has accepted the democratic legal workers' associations of Germany, Austria, Syria, and Lebanon as members of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.

Note: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers was founded in 1946. The purpose of the association is to expose the crimes of aggressors and to fight for peace. Progressive representatives from the world's legal community have attended the three congresses held in Paris, Brussels, and Prague. The association has played a significant role in safeguarding the work of international democrats. For example, the association intervened in writing and defended seventy Catalans accused in Spain; it forced the Greek royalist fascist court to postpone the death sentence of a well-known democratic legal worker; and the association obtained the right to defend a group of Iranian democrats tried by the Iranian fascist government.

　　国际民主法律工作者协会理事会
  　决议积极参加争取人权斗争
    【新华社北平二十六日电】莫斯科讯：国际民主法律工作者协会（前译为国际民主律师协会）理事会曾于上月间在巴黎举行会议，据返抵此间的苏联代表团团长、苏联最高法院副院长捷丁谈称：理事会会议已决定于九月下旬在意大利（地点未定）举行国际民主法律工作者协会第四次代表大会，大会将讨论确认国际条约是国际和平合作的必要条件，各附属国与殖民地国家的人民权利、及对新战争挑拨者进行斗争等问题。理事会会议通过积极参加争取民权与人权之斗争的决议，并决定派遣代表以观察员的身份出席现在美国举行的对美国共产党领袖的审判。
    又民主会业已接受德国、奥地利、叙利亚及黎巴嫩四国的民主法律工作者协会为国际民主法律工作者协会的会员。
    按：国际民主法律工作者协会成立于一九四六年，该会的宗旨是为揭露侵略者的罪行、为争取和平而斗争。世界法律学界的进步代表都曾出席在巴黎、布鲁塞尔和布拉格举行的三次代表大会。该协会在维护国际民主分子的工作上，起了很大的作用。例如，协会曾书面干涉了并维护了在西班牙被控告的七十名加泰隆尼亚人；曾迫使希腊保皇法西斯法庭延缓执行对某一著名的民主法律工作者的死刑判决；协会曾获得为一批被伊朗法西斯政府审判的伊朗民主人士辩护的权利。
