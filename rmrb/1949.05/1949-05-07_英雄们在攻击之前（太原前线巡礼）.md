　　Heroes Before the Attack
    (A Tour of the Taiyuan Front)
    Xu Kong

　　“Hundreds of thousands of brothers in arms, the sounds of battle shake the heavens as we besiege Taiyuan. We only await the order to capture the war criminals within Taiyuan city!” These are lines from a quick-rhythm song sung by the soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front as they returned from outside. If anyone has any doubts about this spirit of pride, you can take a look at the company. On April 6th, as dusk fell, the soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit had just returned from the Taiyuan Campaign mobilization meeting, and they were all happily jumping up and down. At the meeting, the regimental leader said: "This is the last major battle in North China. Our task is to penetrate and divide, to drill into the enemy's belly to fight. The most arduous and glorious task has been given to us by the higher-ups!"
　　Communist Party member Li Shihai picked up a whetstone from somewhere as he entered the courtyard, drew his bayonet and began to sharpen it, singing: "A sharp and bright bayonet will send Yan Xishan to see the King of Hell!" Tian Fusheng, Shen Bao… a large group rushed up with a whoosh. You sharpen, I sharpen, while raising their voices and shouting: "You know, those dogs are still wearing cotton-padded jackets!" "Even if they wore fur coats, we'll make sure it's pierced through!"
　　Many "disputes" arose in various units for requesting the main task. The two grooms of the machine gun and artillery company of a certain battalion refused to do their job anymore and demanded to go to the assault platoon. Cheng Yushan, the company commander of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, who had always obeyed the leadership of the Party, openly "rebelled" against the battalion committee's opinion today, because their company was the honor spearhead company. The day before yesterday, the battalion commander informed them that they would be in the front, but today, at the battalion committee meeting, in order to preserve the strength of the spearhead company, they were placed behind the Sixth Company when the action started. He was anxious, his face flushed red: "How am I going to explain this to the soldiers when I get back? Everyone knows that our spearhead company is at the front, and they are all overjoyed, even their small shovels and picks are sharpened quickly, just waiting for the order to capture Yan Xishan. Why are we being placed behind the Sixth Company now?" The regimental political director severely criticized him: "This is a narrow-minded view of wanting to be first. The strength of the spearhead company should not be wasted casually until it is time to use it." Finally, he lowered his head and smiled embarrassedly: "This is my mistake." This twenty-two-year-old young company commander, hoping day and night to give full play to the power of the spearhead company, on the morning of April 14th – they had practiced until twelve o'clock the night before – as soon as it dawned, he suddenly jumped out of bed, not even dressed, waving his left arm and shouting, "Hey! We've broken through! Comrades!" Comrade Zhu Zhi, the regimental commander, once told me: "Our soldiers are so lovely. From morning to night, they simply don't know what it means to be tired or to suffer!" I have also personally witnessed this situation. Every morning, before the sun has even turned red, the troops are already in the open space shouting and practicing battlefield movements. At night, when it's almost midnight, the sky outside the village is still filled with colorful flares, and there are raging wildfires everywhere, deafening explosions, and the cries of "kill!" The soldiers are nervously conducting night exercises. Liu Yushu, the Communist Party member and squad leader of the Fourth Squad of the Eighth Company of a certain unit, studied with his brothers and molded models of various types of pillboxes, bunkers, and fire bunkers out of mud. After returning from the exercise, they would place these things on the table, light an oil lamp, and everyone would sit around and meticulously study and review where to approach for demolition, and where to outflank and encircle. By this time, the rooster crowed in the east, and they were still buried in these small bunkers. They said, "It's not just to shed less blood during the war, the most important thing is to complete the task assigned by the Party with 100% certainty!"
　　Finally, I would like to end this "tour of the front" with a small story. The incident occurred in the Fourth Squad of the spearhead Fourth Company of a certain unit. In the Taiyuan campaign assessment, the Fifth Squad of that company was first. Wang Xiaoquan, the squad leader of the Fourth Squad, cried during the review. He said: "The brothers all worked hard, it's all my fault for not leading well. The Fourth Squad has always been a model squad, but it has fallen behind in this last glorious task in North China!" Two days later, when the branch committee expanded meeting discussed the task, the spearhead squad was given to them again. The whole squad jumped and laughed with joy. Everyone wiped the automatic weapons – submachine guns – issued by the higher authorities until they were pitch black and shiny, and even wiped the dust and grease from every bullet. Wang Xiaoquan ran to the company headquarters in three steps and two strides and said: "The task of the spearhead squad won't change again, will it!" At that time, a common thought among the troops was that they were afraid that the higher authorities would not give them arduous tasks.

　　英雄们在攻击之前
    （太原前线巡礼）
    徐孔
    “兄弟大军几十万，杀声连天围太原，单等一声号令下，太原城里捉战犯。”这是太原前线解放军某部八连的战士们从外面回来唱出的几句快板。如果有人对这种自豪的气魄还有什么怀疑的话，你可以到连队里看一下，四月六日天已黄昏，某部八连的战士们刚开完太原战役动员大会回来，一个个全喜欢的一蹦一跳的。会上团首长说：“这是华北最后的一次大会战，我们的任务是猛插分割，钻进敌人的肚子里打，上级最艰巨最光荣的任务给了咱！”
    共产党员李世海进院也不知从什么地方检出块磨石，抽出刺刀就磨，嘴里还不住的唱：“刺刀磨的快又亮，管叫你阎老西见阎王！”田福胜、申保……一大堆呼的一声都抢上来了，你也磨，我也磨，一边磨着一边扯起嗓门嚷：“知道吧，狗儿的们还穿着棉袄哪！”“皮袄也保险它一下一个透心凉！”
    各个单位为了要求主要任务发生过许多“纠纷”。某营机炮连的两个饲养员说什么也不干了要求到突击排去。一向服从党的领导的某部四连长程玉山今天都在营委会上公开的“反抗”营委的意见了，因为他连荣誉尖刀连前两天营首长通知他们在最前面走，今天营委会上为了保存尖刀连的力量开始行动的时候把他们放在六连的后边了。他急得满脸通红：“我回去怎么和战士们讲呢？大家都知道我们尖刀子连走在最前面，一个个都乐得飞飞的，连小铣小镐都磨得飞快，光等下命令捉阎锡山了，为什么又把我们放在六连的后面呢？”团政治主任严厉的批评了他：“这是狭隘的抢先观点，不到用尖刀子连的时候，尖刀连的力量是不能随便浪费的。”最后他低下头来难为情的笑了：“这是我的错误。”这个廿二岁年青的连长，为了日夜希望发挥尖刀连的威力，曾于四月十四日早晨——前一天夜里他们演习到十二点钟才回来——天刚亮，他突然从被窝里跳起来，衣服也没穿，轮着左臂嚷着“嗨！插进去啦！伙计们！”团长朱智呢同志曾和我这样说：“咱们的战士真是太可爱，一天从早到晚简直就不知什么叫个累，什么叫个苦！”我也曾亲眼看到这种情形，每天早起，大阳没冒红，队伍已经在空场上叫喝着练战场动作了。夜晚，天快半夜了，村外天空里还飞腾着五光十色的信号弹，到处是熊熊的野火，轰天动天的爆破声，呀呀的杀冲声，战士们在紧张的作着夜间演习。某部八连四班长共产党员刘玉书，他和弟兄们研究，用泥捏成各色各样的梅花碉、伏地堡、火力碉……的模型，演习回来，就把这些东西摆在桌子上，点起一盏油灯，大家坐在周围一点一滴的研究检讨应该从那里运动接近爆破，应该从那里迂回围歼，这时东边鸡叫了，他们还埋头在这些小碉堡里。他们说：“不光是为了战时少流血，最重要的是百分之百的完成党交给的任务呀！”
    最后我想用一个小故事来结束我这个“前线巡礼”。事情发生于某部尖刀四连的第四班，太原进军评判，该连第五班第一。四班长王小全在检讨的时候竟哭了，他说：“兄弟们都努力，全怪我领导的不好，四班一贯模范偏偏在这华北最后一次光荣任务里落后了呀”！过两天在支委扩大会讨论任务的时候，尖刀班又给他们了，全班喜欢的又跳又笑，大家把上级发来的自动火器——冲锋枪，擦得炮黑油亮，连每颗子弹上的灰尘油垢都擦得干干净净，王小全三步两步跑到连部里说：“尖刀班的任务不会再变了罢！”当时队伍上一个普遍的思想顾虑，是怕上级不交给自己艰巨的任务。
