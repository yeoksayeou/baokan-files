    Harbin People's Congress
    Preparatory Committee Established
    Great Achievements in Supporting the Front Lines Over the Past Three Years
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: The Harbin People's Congress Preparatory Committee was established on April 28th, the third anniversary of the establishment of the city's people's government. The main task of the preparatory committee is to prepare for the convocation of the city's People's Congress. Before the People's Congress is established, it will serve as a consultative body reflecting public opinion and implementing government decrees. People from all walks of life have enthusiastically responded to the call of the municipal government and elected their representatives. All twenty-five representatives elected by the Federation of Trade Unions are labor heroes, production models, work models, and worker cadres and trade union workers loved by the masses. Farmers in the suburban districts have also elected production models and honest and upright representatives who can speak for them. In addition, representatives of model military families and honored soldiers were also elected.
    The city has played a significant role in the three years of the Liberation War. Since 1943, more than 6,900 young people in the city have voluntarily joined the army; the number of civilians mobilized for participation in the war includes: more than 5,000 civilian laborers, 1,170 automobile drivers, more than 900 doctors and nurses, and more than 2,200 rubber-wheeled carts were dispatched. The people of the city have repeatedly launched enthusiastic movements to support the army, sending a total of more than 233,000 pairs of military shoes, 2.5069 billion yuan in cash, and慰问品慰问品价值约19.82 billion yuan worth of慰问品to the front lines. Workers, students, and staff members have enthusiastically donated blood to rescue the wounded in every battle. Last year, 12,000 women were mobilized to sew cotton, completing 600,000 sets of cotton military uniforms and army overcoats, ensuring that the People's Liberation Army changed into winter clothing in due time. Now, the working people of the city, led by the workers, are actively producing with high labor enthusiasm to support the southward advance of the army to liberate all of China.
