    Taiyue Administrative Office
    Punishes Profiteers
    [Taiyue Electric] The Tongyi Yonghua shop of private merchant Wu Xide in Nanfan Town, Jiang County, repeatedly took the opportunity to engage in speculation during price fluctuations. The Taiyue Administrative Office, in order to serve as a warning, imposed a fine of 1,500 yuan. It is reported that during the price fluctuations last winter, the shop colluded with Wang Shangkun of the Jishengcheng production organization in Yangcheng County, raising the price of cotton by one yuan per catty on November 16th of the lunar calendar, then by four yuan on December 6th, and again by two yuan and five jiao on the 23rd, engaging in speculative manipulation and reaping huge profits. On March 5th of this year, the shop borrowed 30,000 yuan that had just been withdrawn from the bank to disrupt grain prices in the market. At that time, wheat was 3,300 yuan per dan, but the shop took advantage of the farmers' honesty and bought four dan and eight dou of wheat from Zhang Quanli in Xiwu Village for 3,000 yuan. When the masses asked to buy one or two dou, the shop refused, insisting on selling it for 3,500 yuan, 200 yuan higher than the market price, causing the price to rise suddenly that day. When the shop was buying grain, Comrade Qiao Guangwen of the trade company educated them face-to-face, but they ignored him. Based on the report from the Second Special District that the shop engaged in speculative manipulation, repeatedly violating regulations without repentance, the Administrative Office decided to impose a penalty.

    处罚投机商
    【太岳电】绛县南樊镇私商吴希德的同义永花，投因在物价波动中，屡次店机太岳区行政公署为警效尤特给予一千五百元的罚金处分。按该花店于去冬物价波动中，与阳城县生产机关集顺成的王尚坤结合，在阴历十一月十六日将棉花每斤提高一元，十二月初六日又提高四元，二十三日又提高二元五角，投机操纵，获利很大。本年三月五日该店又借刚由银行抽来的三万元，在市场上扰乱粮价，常时麦子三千三百元一大石，但该店欺负农民老实，将西吴村张全礼的四石八斗麦子，以三千元买下，群众要求分买一、二斗，该店均拒绝不给，硬要另售三千五百元，高于市价两百元，使当天物价突然提高。当该店买粮时，贸易公司乔广文同志曾当面对其教育，但却置之不理。据此二专署报告该店投机操纵，屡犯不改，经行政公署决定予以处罚。
