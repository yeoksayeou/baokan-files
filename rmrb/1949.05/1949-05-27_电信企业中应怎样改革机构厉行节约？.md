Working Suggestion

　　Since the Kuomintang's reactionary rule left many unreasonable phenomena in enterprise departments, Mr. Jiang Shushen, in order to rationalize the institutional system of telecommunications enterprises, has studied various aspects of the situation in detail and put forward preliminary opinions. We believe that this spirit is good. It is hoped that telecommunications departments and even other enterprise departments will be able to carefully examine and expose all unreasonable phenomena and formulate measures to reform them, so that all aspects can be scientific and rationalized, in order to facilitate the advancement of construction undertakings.

    Since the Kuomintang's finances entered a state of "vicious inflation," the Telecommunications Bureau formed a blind state of "supporting people." Those with connections, those with power, and those with opportunities, tried their best to bring their private individuals into the Telecommunications Bureau, with husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and brothers and sisters coming together to eat at the Telecommunications Bureau. There were families with eight members all receiving salaries from the Telecommunications Bureau. Among them, many were eating vacancies (workers and laborers), nominal (lower and middle-level staff, unskilled assistants), and moonlighting (senior and junior staff). Therefore, the number of telecommunications employees nationwide increased from 20,000 (approximately the statistics of 1930) to 60,000 (1947 statistics). Although the business has expanded more in recent years than before, it is too unbalanced compared with the number of people.
    Telecommunications construction emphasizes lifespan. However, since the Kuomintang came to power, in order to fight against the people, under the principle of adapting to wartime needs, emergency response, and contingency measures, many construction projects did not pay attention to standards or long-term efficiency. When needed, they built hastily and carelessly; when they needed to be dismantled, they were dismantled in a hurry and in a mess. Newly erected lines had induction, brand-new machines had faults, and newly completed houses needed repairs. Taking overhead lines as an example, except for the long-distance telephone lines in nine provinces, which were up to standard, no decent line engineering could be seen elsewhere. Walking through every telecommunications bureau under Kuomintang rule, it was impossible to know the consumption rate of a certain material or equipment. How many paper strips were used for incoming and outgoing relay reports, how much liquid fuel, how many kilometers did the car travel, how long did the oil engine run, how long would a vacuum tube signal light resistor last – no one was willing to answer these questions clearly: either the machine was faulty and consumed a lot of oil, or the quality of the materials was not good. But if the machine was faulty, why not fix it? How was the quality of incoming materials accepted? Such a rebuttal would leave them speechless. In fact, old was exchanged for new, and the remaining materials were used for purchases, and then entered the warehouse through the method of incoming goods. Some private individuals fattened themselves under these circumstances.
    The administrative system of the Telecommunications Bureau was completely bureaucratic. Since Sheng Xuanhuai created the Telegraph Bureau, he appointed a candidate for Dao Yin as the telegraph supervisor, and a tiger-headed sign with "Telegraph Bureau Important Place, No Idlers Allowed" was hung at the entrance of the Telecommunications Bureau. Internally, they only talked about official document formats and administrative procedures, not about reality, slavishly introducing foreign systems, super-accountancy, independent personnel agencies, separation of industrial and business affairs, and separation of business administration in large and small districts. These systems did not know how many detours they took and how much wrong money was spent. In fact, each system was a set of official articles, with some people coming to power and some people stepping down. Super-accountancy could not prevent fraud, and further facilitated the sharing of loot between accountants and chiefs. Personnel independence, apart from implementing instructions for appointment, dismissal, promotion, demotion, rewards, and punishments, no regulations could work. The separation and merger of industrial and business affairs could not change the old routine of each doing its own thing.
    The entire society has changed, and the phenomenon of "public utility leaders raising prices" will no longer exist. Telecommunications enterprises should always adhere to the two major principles of economic self-sufficiency and determining the prices of telegrams and calls based on cost plus profit (because in order to seek enterprise development, it is necessary to accumulate funds for reproduction).
    Fully Utilize Existing Human Resources
    The 60,000 employees nationwide must have appropriate arrangements, and the phenomenon of overstaffing must be improved.
    The classification of personnel was previously divided into technicians, telegraph operators, telephone operators, business personnel, accountants, clerks, telegraph assistants, mechanical assistants, line assistants, technicians, telegraph messengers, laborers, and coolies. The staff and assistants were further divided into first, second, and third classes. In fact, technical personnel and assistants did clerical work, clerks did business work, business personnel manned telegrams and telephones, and telegraph and telephone operators did technical work. Qualifications and positions were also somewhat mixed. It is better to simply divide them into three categories: 1. Administrative management personnel: heads, secretaries, document clerks, personnel, etc. belong to this category. 2. Technical personnel: design of machinery, lines, and buildings, line construction, installation, and manufacturing of equipment belong to this category. 3. Business personnel: transmission of telegrams and calls (including manning machines and delivery), collection of fees, and registration of telegrams (including telegram processing and compilation) belong to this category. Each of the three categories is divided into several grades. Simple classification makes allocation and deployment relatively easy, and there are fewer opportunities for idle manpower. Administrative management personnel and business personnel can easily learn from each other's skills because the two categories of skills are relatively easy to learn, and they can interchange positions under specific conditions.
    The allocation of personnel must be adapted to the size of the business scope, and ostentatious organizations can no longer be established. Non-management agencies can only have one level of division of responsibilities. For example, a first-class telecommunications bureau should only set up three sections: administration, technology, and business, under the head. The current system of parallel bureaus, stations, sections, and teams must be abolished. There should be no more units under the sections, and of course, responsibilities should be assigned to individuals. Simplifying the organization in this way can save some administrative expenses and wages.
    In telecommunications enterprises, although increasing salaries based on seniority and years of service can make employees stay in their positions for a long time and not be easily tempted to change jobs, it also causes inertia and a lack of progress. The personnel system of the post office should be imitated: higher positions must be held by those with higher salary grades. If their salary grade is high but they cannot hold a high position, their salary increases based on seniority and years of service should be restricted.
    Dismissing current employees due to technical backwardness does not require immediate removal; they can be reassigned to lower positions based on their abilities. Those whose talents are not suitable for the telecommunications departments should be transferred to agencies suitable for their talents by the public in accordance with their strengths.
    For some positions that are directly related to the consumption of materials and whose base salary has always been relatively low, such as car drivers, boiler stokers, and power room drivers, their base salary should be increased to encourage them to save material consumption.
    Rewarding the learning of skills other than one's own can enable the local deployment of other types of personnel to assist when the business of certain departments is suddenly busy, avoiding the expense of dispatching travel expenses and reducing the number of standby personnel.
    In telecommunications construction, the most costly items are lines and buildings. If construction is not carried out casually, maintenance costs will be relatively reduced. For example, overhead lines constructed with wooden poles that are not of sufficient size and "drum-shaped insulators" or "card nails" may have a construction cost ratio of four to six compared to lines constructed with standard-sized wooden poles and flat-shoulder insulators, but the line repair cost may be in the ratio of ten to one. Sometimes, the annual repair costs of a makeshift line exceed the construction cost.
    As for buildings, the lifespan of reinforced concrete is usually three to seven times that of brick and wood structures. The former rarely needs repairs in the first ten years, while the latter often requires minor and major repairs several times in ten years.
    Standard construction projects will not be easily passed during acceptance. Therefore, the responsible system for acceptance can be seriously implemented. This provides a basis for assessing maintenance costs.
    Clearly Define the Consumption Rate of Equipment and Materials
    For some materials, such as printed matter and filled-out or bound reports and account books, and the statistics of the number of words and times of incoming and outgoing relay reports, the ratios between incoming and outgoing relay paper, paper strips, and report envelopes, and between the number of kilometers traveled by vehicles and the time of operation of boilers and furnaces and fuel, are not difficult to assess and stipulate (the anarchic state of self-flow often allows these materials to be consumed without standards). However, when setting the ratio, the factors of possible losses should be included.
    Implement the Exchange of Old for New System
    For machine and line repairs, materials calculated by the piece must also be exchanged for new ones. For those calculated by length or weight, the quantity of returned waste materials must also have a considerable ratio with the new materials received. The receipt and expenditure of returned waste materials must be recorded in a separate account, but this account can be used for a long time and does not need to be replaced annually.
    For fixed equipment, except for accidental lightning strikes, wind, or fire damage, the minimum usage time limit should be established. Those who cause sudden damage due to technical errors must also develop a compensation method.
    The railway's recently promoted responsible system for train crews can also be imitated in the Telecommunications Bureau's receiving stations, transmitting stations, power rooms, helper motors, carrier machines, repair workshops, relay lines in the maintenance rooms, and switchboards equipped with fixed machines.
    For bulky or scattered materials scattered outside the bureau, the responsible department within the bureau must have separate records and cannot rely solely on the records of the person in charge, so that it is always known where what materials are stored, to avoid forgetting and loss.
    Those who actually consume less equipment and materials than the specified standard and extend the life of materials and equipment should be assessed and rewarded periodically by the person directly in charge.
    The equipment costs of the warehouse should not only be aimed at saving money. The natural consumption rate of rat bites, insect infestation, mildew, and evaporation of inventory equipment should be specified with a maximum rate, and responsibility should be investigated when it is exceeded.
    The electricity consumption for lighting and heating should be stipulated with electricity consumption standards according to the season and the location of electricity use. If it is exceeded, the cause should be investigated, and the user should be required to compensate if necessary. Electricity meters should be installed separately in multiple locations.
    Centralized Procurement of Equipment and Supplies in Large Quantities
    Sporadic procurement makes it difficult to ensure the quality of goods and inevitably raises prices. It is best to concentrate on large-scale procurement, especially trading directly with publicly owned manufacturers. In the past, the method of purchasing from private individuals who were not engaged in the industry had the most abuses.
    In cities with power supply, self-generating power with oil engines should be avoided as much as possible. Even if rectifiers and transformers are installed as a result, it is cost-effective.
    Materials that can be entrusted to railways, ships, and highways for transportation should be avoided from using self-owned transportation tools to transport materials over long distances, except when time is urgent. Because the freight fee is always less than self-transportation.
    Timely Disposal of Waste Materials
    Based on the example of fifteen special-grade and first-class bureaus among the more than 1,000 telecommunications bureaus nationwide, the accumulated waste lines nationwide may reach 2,000 to 5,000 tons. Most of these lines are discarded. They should be concentrated to places with copper and iron wire manufacturing factories and exchanged for new lines. If the area is remote and the transportation is inconvenient and requires long-distance transportation, it should be discussed separately.
    The zinc strips of waste dry cells can be reused, and there are quite a few of these waste materials, which should be concentrated and utilized.
    In places where there are paper mills in large cities, old and outdated reports and documents, except for confidential ones, should be exchanged for new paper with the paper mills after being reviewed and approved for destruction.
    Because reactionary rule left us with many unreasonable phenomena, this is our heavy burden. At present, our telecommunications enterprises still have some phenomena of being more blind the busier they are. In the future, standards should be determined for what constitutes good work, who should do what work, how many people should do what work, what materials should be consumed for what work, what equipment should be used for what purpose, how long the lifespan of each equipment is, and what the ratio between what expenses and what business is.

　　电信企业中应怎样改革机构厉行节约？
    蒋树森
    国民党的反动统治，给企业部门遗留下许多不合理现象。蒋树森君为使电信企业的机构制度合理化，详细研究了各方面的情况，并提出初步意见，我们认为这种精神是好的。希望电信部门以至其他企业部门人员都能详细检查揭发所有不合理的现象，订出办法来加以改革，使各方面都能科学化合理化，以利建设事业的推进。
    编者
    　
    自从国民党的财政走进“恶性通货膨胀”以后，电信局就形成盲目的“养人”状态。有门路的，有权势的，有机会的，把自己的私人尽量弄进电信局，夫妻父子兄弟相率来吃电信局。有一家连身八口都在电信局领薪的。其中有些许多是吃缺的（工友小工）、挂名的（中下级职员、无技术的佐）、兼差的（高中级职员）。所以全国电信职工由两万人（大约是民国十九年的统计）增到六万人（三十六年统计）。虽然近年的业务是比前扩充了，但与人数相比则太不平衡。
    电信建设，是讲究寿命的。但自国民党执政以来，为了对人民作战，在适应战时需要，应急，应变的原则下，许多建设工程，不讲标准，不讲长远效率。要用就仓卒马虎的建设，要撤就慌张忙乱的拆除。刚架的线路就有感应，崭新的机器就有故障，刚落成的新屋就须补漏。以架空线路来举例，除去九省长途话线还够上标准以外，此外就看不到象样的线路工程。走遍每个国民党统治下的电信局，想知道对于某种材料器材的消耗率，是得不到的。多少来去转报用多少纸条，多少液体燃料，汽车行多少公里，油机开多少时间，一只真空管信号灯阻力器可有多久，这些问题谁也不肯明确答复：不是说机器有毛病，耗油多，就是材料的质量不佳。但是机器有毛病何以不修好？来料质量不佳怎样验收的？这样一反驳，就没话说。实际是以旧换新，剩余下来做为搜购，又以进货方式入库了。有些私人就在这情形下肥壮起来。
    电信局的行政制度，完全官僚化，自从盛宣怀创建电局以来，任候补道为电报监督，电局门口挂上一块“电局重地闲人莫入”的虎头牌，内部专讲公文程式，行政手续，不讲实际，生吞活剥的介绍外国制度，超然会计，人事独立机构，工务业务分立，大区小区业务行政分开，这些制度不知走多少弯路，化多少冤钱。实际每个制度全是一套官样文章，几个人上台，几个人下台。超然会计，防止不了舞弊，进一步会计与长官分脏。人事独立，除去秉承意旨而任免升降奖惩，什么章程也行不通。工务业务分开同合并，变不了各行其是的老套。
    整个社会变了，“公用事业领导涨价”不致再有此种现象了。电信企业应该永远守住经济自给自足，根据成本加利润（因欲谋企业发展，须积蓄再生产资金），订报话收费价目这两个大原则。
    充分利用现有人力
    全国六万职工，必须有适当的安排，人浮于事的现象必须改良。
    人员的分类，过去分为技术员、报务员、话务员、业务员、会计员、事务员、报务佐、机务佐、线务佐、技工、报差、工役、小工，员佐并分为一、二、三等。实际上技报人员佐差役办事务工作，事务员办业务工作，业务员值报话机，报话员办技术工作，资格同职务，亦经有些混合了，不如简分为三类：一、行政管理人员：首长、秘书、文书、人事等属之。二、技术人员：机械、线路、建筑的设计、架线、装机、制造器材等属之。三、业务人员：传递报话（包括值机同递送）、收费、册报（包括报务处理同编缮）属之。三类各分为若干等级，分类简单，配置调派也比较容易，人力闲空机会比较少，行政管理人员与业务人员因两类技能比较容易互相学习，在特定条件下可以互通职务。
    人员的配置，必定与业务范围大小相适应，铺张门面的组织不能再设立。非管理性质的机关，分职只能一级。例如一等电信局，在首长之下，仅设行政、技术、业务三科。现行局站段队并列制必须废除。科下不再设股，职务当然分人去掌理。这样简化组织，事务费用同工资是可以节省些。
    电信企业中按工龄年功加俸，虽能使其久安其位，不见异思迁，但也因此引起了惰性发展，不求长进，应仿邮局人事制度：较高职务必由较高薪级的担任。如其薪级高而不能任高职的，其工龄年功加俸应该受到限制。
    因技术落后而淘汰现职，并不须立即清除出去，可以量才换与较低的职位。才能不适于电信各部门工作的，应按其所长，由公家负责转业于适其才能的机构。
    有些职务，对于材料的消耗有直接关系，其底薪一向较低的，例如汽车司机，锅炉司炉，动力室司机，应该将其底薪提高点，这样可鼓励其节省材料消耗。
    奖励学习本职以外的技能，可使某些部门业务骤忙时能就地调他类人员协助，免去调派旅费的支出及减少备用人员。
    电信建设，最费成本的是线路同建筑物。建设不将就从事，维持费用就相对的减少。例如架空线路，用不够尺寸的木杆和“鼓形隔电子”或“卡钉”架成的线路，那比用标准尺寸的木杆同扁担装隔电子架成的线路相较，其设线成本可能为四与六之比，但是修线费用可能为十与一之比。有时一条因陋就简的线路一年间所化的修线费用超过建设成本。
    至于建筑物，钢筋水泥的寿命，通常为砖木建筑三倍至七倍。前者最初十年很少需要修理，而后者十年之中小修大修常有数次。
    合乎标准的建设工程，验收时就不会马虎过去。因此验收负责制度可以认真执行。这样对于维持费用之考核也有了根据。
    明订器材料具的消耗率
    有些材料，类如印刷品与填出或装订的报表帐簿，来去转报字数次数的统计，对于来去转报纸，同纸条及报封；行车公里开机烧炉时间之对于燃料，其相互间比率并不难考核规定（无政府的自流状态常让这些材料漫无标准地消耗），惟订比率时应加入可能损失的因素。
    实行以旧换新制
    修换机线，按件计的材料，亦须缴旧领新。其以长度或重量计者，其缴回数量亦应与所领新料订有相当比率。缴回废料，必须有帐分户记录其收支数目，但此帐可以长久使用，不须按年度更换。
    固定装用的器材，除去意外的雷击风火损毁者外，应订立最低使用时限。其因技术错误而猝使破坏者，并须制定赔偿办法。
    最近铁路倡行的乘务负责制，电局里装有固定机件的收讯台、发讯台、动力室、帮电机、载波机、修配厂的各工场，修养室中继线、交换台，亦可仿照拟订办法施行。
    散存在局外的笨重或零星材料，局内主管部分须有分户记录，不能仅靠经手人有记录，俾随时可知何处存有何料，以免遗忘流失。
    器材料具的实际消耗低于规定标准，以及延长料具寿命的，其直接负责人应按期考核，给与奖励。
    仓库的设备费用，不能只图省钱，库存器材的鼠蚀虫蛀霉烂蒸发，这种自然消耗率、应订明最高率，超过时应追究其责任。
    光热的用电，应按时季及用电处所订立用电标准，超过时应考查其原因，必要时责由使用人代偿，电表应设法分装多处。
    器材用品大批集中采购
    零星采购，货质下能整齐，货价难免抬高。最好集中大批采购，能直接与公营厂商交易尤妥。过去向非经营该业之私人搜购一法，流弊最多。
    在有电力供给的城市，应尽量避免自己用油机发电。即使因此而加装整流器与变压器，亦属合算。
    能够交铁路轮船公路托运的材料，除去时间迫不得已外，应避免用自有的运输工具运接长距离的材料。因为托运费无论如何比自运少些。
    废料及时处理
    全国一千多个电信局，就十五个特等、一等局例子推算，全国垒积的废线，可能达两千吨至五千吨。这些线大都弃置不理。应该分道集中至设有制造铜铁线工厂的地方，与之交换新线。如地区偏僻，交通不便，须要长距离运输者，又当别论。
    废干电的锌条是可以再用的，这种废料相当多，应该集中利用。
    在大都市设有纸厂的地方，陈旧过时的表报文件，除机密性者外，经过审查准予销毁者，应该与纸厂进行交换新纸。
    因为反动统治给我们留下许多不合理现象，这是我们沉重的负担，当前我们的电信企业，还存在些越忙越盲的现象。今后，工作怎么样算做好，什么人应当做什么工作，什么工作应当多少人去做，什么工作应当耗费什么材料多少，什么器材应该做什么用，每种器材的寿命多久，什么费用同什么业务它的相互比率怎样，这些标准都应确定。
