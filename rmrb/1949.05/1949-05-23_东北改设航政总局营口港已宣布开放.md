    【北平新华广播电台广播】沈阳二十二号消息：东北行政委员会交通部为了统一管理东北解放区境内的航运，经东北行政委员会二月五号批准，把原来所属东北航运局改为“东北航政总局”。总局设在营口，下面辖安东、哈尔滨两航政局，又在吉林、佳木斯、辑安等地设立办事处，现在各航政机关都已经开始办公。
    【北平新华广播电台广播】沈阳二十二号消息：东北行政委员会为繁荣东北经济和发展对外贸易，上月十九号命令公布开放营口港，现在东北航政总局正在准备开港的各项工作。营口港原来有公私码头二—多处，一共长六千八百多公尺，在国民党统治时期，港湾设备都遭受严重破坏，东北航政总局业已动手加以修建和恢复，预计需要费用大约三百多万元东北币。
