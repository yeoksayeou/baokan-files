Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th – The public commercial network that connects the vast urban and rural areas of Northeast China has increasingly become the main link for communicating the urban and rural economies of the Northeast. Currently, over 80% of the cities in Northeast China have established public stores, with 637 business units (including stores, outlets, and business offices) and over 30,000 staff and workers. Under the leadership of the Commercial Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, these public stores are divided into four systems according to their business nature: department stores, grain companies, fuel companies, and native produce companies. Their business policy is to purchase grain, by-products, and industrial raw materials in rural areas, adjust the prices of industrial and agricultural products, and supply farmers with means of production and livelihood materials, in order to promote the development of agricultural production. In cities, they regulate grain, ensure the supply of living necessities for workers and citizens, promote the products of public factories and enterprises, organize necessary private processing industries, regulate urban and rural supply and demand, stabilize prices, and fight against the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants. In the two years and four months from December 1946 to March of this year, the aforementioned public stores sold a total of 434,700 tons of grain, 216,539 tons of edible salt, and 1,011,514 bolts of cloth. At the same time, they purchased 1,585,212 tons of grain, fur equivalent to 62.77985 billion Northeast currency, 11,400,174 kilograms of hog bristles, horse tails, tobacco, flax, and cotton, and other local products equivalent to 266.46451 billion Northeast currency. Public stores in various regions have already taken a leading position in the wholesale market.

Since the complete liberation of Northeast China, the business expansion of public stores has been particularly rapid. The two major economic centers of North and South Manchuria -- Shenyang and Harbin -- have ten department stores, tobacco companies, and industrial and agricultural service agencies, with 78 business units. Shenyang's four large-scale department stores mainly deal in cotton cloth, daily necessities, office supplies, mechanical equipment, industrial raw materials, and workers' daily necessities. In addition, they act as sales agents or exclusive distributors for materials and finished products for factories in Andong, Yingkou, Fushun, Benxi, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, and other places, to support production, regulate materials, and meet the needs of the people. The Harbin Trading Company and Department Store have played a particularly significant role in regulating the prices of industrial and agricultural products. Taking the average ratio of grain to cloth in 1946 as a base, and comparing it with the average ratio of grain to cloth in March of this year, the price of grain increased by 343%, while the price of cloth decreased by 77%, narrowing the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products and stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production. The area on both banks of the Songhua River, centered on Jiamusi, now has more than 20 public stores. Jiamusi City has two major department stores with daily sales of nearly 300 million. The counties on the west bank of the Heilongjiang River, north of Harbin, a famous grain-producing area, also have 57 public stores, focusing on promoting cotton, salt, cloth, farm tools, and groceries. Due to the increasing purchasing power of farmers, the average daily sales of department stores in the entire region reach over 2 billion. The Nenjiang area, centered on Qiqihar, has 43 public stores. The largest public store in Qiqihar, the Nenjiang Trading Company, has an average daily sales volume of 1 billion, with considerable achievements in exchanging urban and rural materials. Public stores in Changchun City are also developing rapidly, with department stores averaging daily sales of 3 billion. State-owned stores have also been widely established in the counties surrounding Jilin City. Among them, Yushu, Jiutai, Yongji and other counties have more than 20 various trading companies. In the South Manchuria area south of Changchun, in addition to Shenyang, cities such as Andong, Siping, Jinzhou, Liaoyang, Yingkou, and Chengde all have large-scale trading companies. Since its opening in September last year, the Andong City Department Store has sold approximately 17 billion worth of goods, supplying the city's government agencies, factories, schools, and more than one-third of the citizens with daily necessities.

After recent business reorganizations, the above-mentioned public commercial enterprises are actively strengthening the establishment of stores in industrial and mining areas and vigorously supporting cooperative enterprises, so that huge quantities of goods can be directly distributed to consumers through cooperatives.

　　沟通城乡经济
  　东北扩展公营商业网
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】贯通东北广大城乡的公营商业网，已日益成为沟通东北城乡经济的主要纽带。目前东北全境百分之八十以上城市，均有公营商店之设立，营业单位（包括商店、门市、营业所）达六百三十七个，有职员工人三万余人。在东北行政委员会商业部领导下，这些公营商店按着业务性质划分为百货公司、粮食公司、燃料公司、土产公司等四个系统。其业务方针为在农村收买粮食、副产物及工业原料，调整工业与农业品价格，供应农民生产资料与生活资料，以推动农业生产之发展。在城市调剂粮食，保证职工和市民生活供给，推销公营工厂企业的产品及组织必要的私人加工业，调剂城乡供求，稳定物价，并与奸商的投机捣把行为作斗争。上述公营商店在一九四六年十二月至今年三月的两年四个月中，共售出粮食四十三万四千七百吨，食盐二十一万六千五百三十九吨，布纱一百零一万一千五百十四匹。同时收购粮食一百五十八万五千二百十二吨，毛皮折合东北币六百二十七亿七千九百八十五万元，猪鬃、马尾、烟草、线麻、棉花一千一百四十万零一千七百五十四公斤，其他土产品折合东北币二千六百六十四亿六千四百五十一万元。各地公营商店已在批发市场上占居了领导地位。
    东北全部解放以来，公营商店的业务扩展尤其迅速。南北满两大经济中心--沈阳及哈尔滨市，共有百货公司、烟草公司及工业、农业服务社十处，营业单位七十八个。沈阳四个规模巨大的百货公司，主要经营纱布、日用杂品、办公用具、机械器材、工业原料及工人日常必需品等。此外并为安东、营口、抚顺、本溪、唐山、秦皇岛等地的若干工厂代销或包销物资及成品，达到扶助生产、调剂物资及解决民需的目的。哈尔滨市贸易公司及百货公司，在调剂工业品与农业品的价格上所起的作用特别显著。以一九四六年的粮食与布的平均比价做基数，与今年三月份粮食与布的平均比价比较，粮食提高了百分之三百四十三，在降低百分之七十七，缩小了工业品与农业品的剪刀差额，刺激了农民的生产情绪。以佳木斯为中心的松花江两岸地区现共有公营商店二十余个。佳木斯市有两大百货公司，每日销货金额近三亿元。哈尔滨以北著名产粮区黑龙江西岸各县，亦有公营商店五十七个，着重推售棉、盐、布匹、农具及杂货等。由于农民购买力日渐提高，全区百货商店平均每日销售额达二十亿以上。以齐齐哈尔为中心的嫩江地区，有公营商店四十三处。齐市最大之公营商店嫩江贸易公司，每日平均销货额为十亿元，在交流城乡物资上有不少成绩。长春市的公营商店也日趋发展，百货公司每日平均销货金额达三十亿元。吉林市周围各县城，也普遍设立国营商店。其中榆树、九台、永吉等县，即有各种贸易公司二十余处。长春以南的南满地区，除沈阳外，安东、四平、锦州、辽阳、营口、承德等城市均有规模巨大的贸易公司。安东市百货公司于去年九月开业以来，即抛售出商品约值一百七十余亿元，供应了该市机关、工厂、学校与三分之一以上市民的生活必需品。
    上述各地的公营商业于最近整顿业务后，正积极加强建立工矿区的商店，并大力扶持合作事业，使巨量商品经过合作社直接分配至消费者手中。
