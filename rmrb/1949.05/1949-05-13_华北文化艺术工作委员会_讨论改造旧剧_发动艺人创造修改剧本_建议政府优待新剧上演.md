    North China Cultural and Artistic Work Committee
    Discusses Reforming Old Operas
    Mobilizes Artists to Create and Revise Scripts
    Recommends Government Preferential Treatment for New Opera Performances
    [This Newspaper's Report] The North China Cultural and Artistic Work Committee held its third meeting in Beiping the day before yesterday. In order to adapt to the current work needs, it was decided to adjust and strengthen the structure of the Cultural Work Committee, establishing a Secretariat, Research Office, Editorial and Publishing Department, and Old Opera Department. Currently, organizations at all levels are assigning personnel and arranging work. At the meeting, a preliminary exchange of views was conducted on the list of representatives from North China to attend the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers. In addition, the old opera work in the two and a half months since the liberation of Beiping was reviewed. It was unanimously agreed that the focus of old opera work in the future should be on revising old scripts and writing new scripts to meet the "new scripts" demands of old artists. The writing of "new scripts" should mainly rely on old artists, mobilizing and helping them to revise and create themselves. Among the old operas, local operas and ballads are more popular and easier to reform, so more attention should be paid to them. The unreasonable systems and bad habits existing in the old opera circles must be gradually changed based on the progress of the old opera reform work and the improvement of the old artists' awareness. In order to encourage new operas (including old operas with new content), it is proposed that the government provide tax exemption or reduction for the performance of new operas to show support and encouragement.

    华北文化艺术工作委员会
    讨论改造旧剧
    发动艺人创造修改剧本
    建议政府优待新剧上演
    【本报讯】华北文化艺术工作委员会于前日在北平举行第三次会议。为适应目前工作需要，决调整与充实文委机构，设置秘书室、研究室、编辑出版处、旧剧处。现各级组织正在配备人事及布置工作中。会上就华北出席全国文艺大会代表名单初步交换意见。此外检讨了北平解放以来两个半月的旧剧工作，一致认为，今后旧剧工作的重点，应是修改旧剧本及编写新的剧本，以满足旧艺人对“新本子”的要求，而编写“新本子”主要应依靠旧艺人，发动与帮助他们自己进行修改与创作。旧剧中，地方戏及曲艺等，比较更具群众性，改造亦较易，因此对之应予以更多注意。旧剧界存在的不合理的制度与恶习，必须根据旧剧改革工作的开展与旧艺人觉悟程度的提高，逐步地加以改变。为鼓励新剧（包括新内容的旧剧）提请政府对新剧的上演，给予免税或减税的优待，以示扶植和奖励。
