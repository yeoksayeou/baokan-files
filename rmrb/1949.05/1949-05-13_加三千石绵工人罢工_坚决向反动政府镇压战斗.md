Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 11th:  The Datong News Agency in Toronto reports:  Three thousand asbestos workers in Asbestos, Quebec, Canada, went on strike on the 5th because the mine owners unreasonably rejected the workers' demands.  When police, equipped with rifles and tear gas, attempted to seize the workers' barricades, the workers fought bravely and persisted for twenty hours.  Dozens of police and miners were injured.  After this conflict, the workers decided to continue the strike and added more barricades.  On the 7th, the police, knowing that force could not solve the problem, came up with a new trick.  They sent a Catholic priest to persuade the workers to go to a church in Asbestos to discuss a solution to the strike.  The workers then sent fifty representatives to St. Anne's Church to meet with church representatives.  After the workers' representatives entered the church, the police immediately launched an attack and violently drove the workers out of the church, injuring many workers.  When the workers were driven into the street, a police officer, under the pretext of imposing martial law, forced the workers' representatives into police cars and escorted them to a prison about 100 kilometers from Asbestos. The police also went to the miners' homes to intimidate the miners' wives and children and arrested two hundred people as hostages.  Despite such destruction by the authorities, the miners continued to defend the barricades in Asbestos without wavering.  The miners demanded to negotiate with the mine owners regarding the demands they put forward during the strike.  The battle for the barricades is still continuing.

    加三千石绵工人罢工
    坚决向反动政府镇压战斗
    【新华社北平十一日电】电通社多伦多讯：加拿大的魁北克省阿斯贝斯多市的三千石绵工人，五日因矿主无理地拒绝工人要求，开始罢工。当配备着步枪和催泪弹的警察，企图夺取工人的障碍物时，工人英勇斗争，坚持了二十小时。警察与矿工数十人受伤。在这次冲突之后，工人仍决定继续罢工，并增设障碍物。七日警察知道武力不能解决问题，便想出一个新花样。派出天主教牧师一人，去劝说工人到阿斯贝斯多的一个教堂来讨论解决罢工问题。工人就派代表五十人到圣安美教堂与教堂代表会面。工人代表进入教堂之后，警察立即发动进攻，并凶暴地把工人逐出教堂，因而有许多工人受伤。工人被驱逐到街上的时候，一位警官便借口实施戒严把工人代表驱入警车，押解到离阿斯贝斯多约百公里的监狱去。警察又到矿工的住宅去恫吓矿工的妻、儿，并逮捕二百人作为人质。尽管遭受当局的这种摧残，矿工们却继续坚守阿斯贝斯多市的障碍物，毫不动摇。矿工要求与矿主谈判罢工时所提出的要求。目前争夺障碍物的战事仍在继续中。
