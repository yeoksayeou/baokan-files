War Criminals Must Be Severely Punished!
	Yan's Bandits Burn, Kill and Loot in Taiyuan
[Taiyuan Telegraph] The Yan Xishan war criminal clique, which was an enemy of the people until its death, ordered bandit troops to set fires and loot everywhere before the liberation of Taiyuan, attempting to completely destroy this city that was about to belong to the people, causing the people of Taiyuan to suffer an unprecedented catastrophe. After our army launched an attack on the outskirts of Taiyuan, war criminals Sun Chu and Wang Jingguo ordered the bandit 83rd Division to burn and loot wildly in the poverty-stricken area of Shouyi Pass. Starting on the evening of April 20, the raging fire soared into the sky and black smoke filled the air for two days and three nights without extinguishing. Of the thirty-four households in thirty-one lanes of Xin'nan Street, the entire property of thirty households was reduced to ashes. Seventy percent of the houses on Shouyi Pass Street were burned down. The bandits also used bayonets and grenades to prevent the victims from putting out the fire themselves. Qin Quansheng and two others in the No. 14 courtyard of Xin'nan Street were injured by bandit grenades while trying to put out the fire. An old man carrying water in the No. 24 courtyard was stabbed to death by a bandit bayonet for trying to salvage things from the fire. On the morning of the 24th, Yan's bandit 34th Army set fire to the most prosperous areas of Liuxiang South Entrance and Qiaotou Street in Taiyuan. After the battle ended at 10 o'clock, the fire was still raging and could not be controlled. Fortunately, a regiment of our army tried its best to rescue the situation, and the fire was cut off at 4 pm. It wasn't until the afternoon of the next day that all the remaining fire was extinguished. It has now been verified that the burned houses include the Shouyi Pass slum residential area, Tongpu Railway Station, railway employee dormitory, railway hospital, Chengbei Chemical Factory, Huafeng Silk Shop in the city, International Pharmacy, Yangxing Middle School, Youren Middle School, Jesus Church, native product market, Shanxi Trading Company, Xiaowutai Business Union Warehouse, and Jin Sheng Textile Factory Qinghua room and other two thousand five hundred and eighty-two rooms. Kaihua City, Trading Ground, Jinxing Manufacturing Factory, Northwest Chemical Factory and other places were looted by Yan's bandits. The public and private property burned and looted amounted to hundreds of thousands of billions. The citizens of Taiyuan hate Yan's bandits' monstrous atrocities, and unanimously demand severe punishment for war criminals. Quan Bingjun, a relative of the victims, said: "If I find Liang Huazhi, I will fight a life-and-death lawsuit with him." A peddler, Li Yingtang, said: "When Sun Chu and Wang Jingguo are tried, I will bite them twice." Worker Yang Shaolin said: "The old thief Yan Xishan has run away, even if he runs to the ends of the earth, we will catch him and settle this blood debt with the people of Taiyuan."
