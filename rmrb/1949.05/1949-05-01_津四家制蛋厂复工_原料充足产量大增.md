    Tianjin Four Egg Product Factories Resume Operations
    Ample Raw Materials Lead to Large Production Increase
    [Tianjin Electric] Of the original five egg product factories in Tianjin, the four factories of Hebei, Lixing, Zhongfu, and Taidong have officially resumed operations and expanded production. Yilong Egg Product Factory is also actively repairing and will start work soon. Before liberation, Tianjin's egg product industry was on the verge of collapse under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government; after the "currency reform" of August 19th last year, all five factories closed down. In the early days of liberation, some capitalists did not understand our Party's policies, suspected that their products could not be exported, and lacked confidence in their business, which led to delayed resumption of work. Later, after government education and with the recovery of foreign trade, the egg factories gradually resumed operations with the support of the North China Foreign Trade Bureau. In order to solve the capital and sales problems of these factories, the Trade Bureau directly signed contracts with two factories, responsible for promoting finished products, and prepaid 80% of the price before receiving the goods to help them with capital turnover. At the same time, thanks to the connection between the city and the vast rural areas, the supply of raw materials was guaranteed, so the factories that started operations all greatly expanded production. Before the liberation of Tianjin, the four factories of Hebei, Lixing, Zhongfu, and Taidong had a total of 510 workers, averaging 300,000 eggs beaten per day, and a monthly output of 60 tons of finished products; now the number of workers has increased to 775, with 618,000 eggs beaten per day and 116 tons of finished products, an increase of nearly one time compared to before. The Lixing Egg Product Factory has doubled its number of workers compared to before and has maximized the efficiency of the factory's machinery and equipment, beating 250,000 eggs per day, creating the factory's highest production record (previously averaging 100,000 eggs per day). Because the workers' wage problem has been relatively appropriately resolved, ensuring a certain standard of living for the workers, the workers' enthusiasm for production has increased, improving production efficiency. In the past, each worker at the Lixing factory averaged 588.2 eggs beaten per day, but now it is 735.3, an increase of 25%. The factories are now increasing equipment and preparing to further expand production. The Taidong Egg Factory alone is adding a boiler, six drying rooms, a drying oven, a water pump, and fifteen storage rooms. The Lixing factory is installing new machinery, and the daily egg-beating volume will soon increase from 250,000 to 320,000. The Hebei factory is also planning to set up a branch in Beiping to expand its business.

    津四家制蛋厂复工
    原料充足产量大增
    【天津电】津市原有五家制蛋厂，现河北、利兴、中孚、泰东四家已正式复工，并扩大了生产。义隆制蛋厂也正积极修整，不日即可开工。解放前，津市制蛋业在国民党反动政府压榨下，早已奄奄一息；去年八一九“币改”后，五家全部倒闭。解放初期，有的资本家不明我党政策，怀疑产品不能出口，对经营多无信心，致迟不复工。后经政府教育，并随着对外贸易恢复，各蛋厂在华北对外贸易管理局扶植下，方陆续开工。贸易管理局为解决各该工厂的资金和销路问题，曾直接与两个工厂订立合同，负责推销成品，并于收货前即照价先付订款百分之八十，帮助其资金周转。同时由于城市与广大农村连成一片，原料获得保障，因而开工各厂均大大扩展了生产。河北、利兴、中孚、泰东四厂在天津解放前共有工人五百一十人，每日平均打蛋三十万个，月产成品六十吨；现在工人已增至七百七十五人，每日打蛋六十一万八千个、成品一百一十六吨，较前提高将及一倍。利兴制蛋厂，工人已较前增加一倍，并发挥了该厂机器设备的最大效能，每天打蛋二十五万个，创造了该厂最高生产纪录（过去每天平均打蛋十万个）。由于比较适当的解决了工人的工资问题，保障了工人一定的生活水平。因而工人生产情绪高涨，提高了生产效率。利兴厂过去每人每天平均打蛋五百八十八点二个，现在则为七百三十五点三个，提高了百分之二十五。现各厂正增加设备，准备更进一步扩大生产。仅泰东蛋厂即增加锅炉一具，烤房六间，烤炉水流一具，抽水机一具，货房十五间。利兴厂正在装置新机器，每天打蛋量不久可由二十五万个增至三十二万个。河北厂并拟在北平设立分厂，扩大营业。
