　　North China Agricultural Machinery Factory Launches Competition
  　Ten Types of Agricultural Machines Nearing Completion
    [Our dispatch] To welcome the June 6th Industrial Exhibition, the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory is about to complete ten types of agricultural machines. The factory convened an enlarged work meeting on the 14th of this month, deciding to manufacture seven types of agricultural machines for the exhibition by the end of the month. Before the meeting concluded, some workers quietly returned to prepare their tools and planned to propose a competition. Liu Yintang, a planer operator, first challenged Meng Guangsheng, a welder, and Wang Xiaoming, a hammer operator. The forging workshop also subsequently proposed a competition to various departments. After receiving the task on the 14th, everyone wanted to continue working on the 15th, despite it being Sunday, and rescheduled the day off to Tuesday. By Tuesday, the day off was changed back to Sunday. When Sunday arrived, the machine shop proposed working overtime, and the forging workshop also insisted on working. By the 23rd, in addition to completing all the parts for the seven agricultural machines, parts for three additional agricultural machines were also made. Assembly is currently underway, and they will be completed soon.

　　华北农业机器厂展开竞赛
  　十种农业机器即将全部完成
    【本报讯】华北农业机器厂为迎接六六工业展览会，十种农业机器即将全部完成。该厂曾于本月十四日召开扩大工务会议，决定从即日起到月底止制造七种农业机器，送大会展览，会议尚未结束，有些工人就悄悄的回去准备工具，并准备提出竞赛。刨车工刘印堂首先向电焊工孟广生、锤工王效明提出挑战，锻工房也随着向各部提出竞赛。十四日接到任务，十五日虽是星期日，但大家要继续工作，改在星期二休息。到了星期二又改为星期日休息。到了星期日，机器房又提出加班，锻工房也要坚持工作。至二十三日，除将七部农业机器的零件全部完成外，又加制三种农业机器的零件。目前正在积极按装，不日即可完成。
