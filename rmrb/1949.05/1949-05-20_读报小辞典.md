　　Nenni—Pietro Nenni, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, was born in 1891 in a poor worker's family in Faenza, northern Italy. At the age of seven, he was sent to an orphanage, and at eighteen he left the orphanage to work. At the age of twenty, he was imprisoned along with another "socialist," namely the later Fascist demon Mussolini, for opposing Italy's war against Turkey. When Mussolini seized power in Italy, Nenni launched a resolute struggle against Fascism, was arrested and tortured, and was expelled from the country in 1926. At that time, Nenni ran a newspaper in France and continued his anti-fascist activities. During the Spanish Civil War, Nenni organized a patriotic volunteer army to help the Spanish Republican government oppose Franco. During the Second World War, Nenni engaged in anti-fascist activities in France and was arrested by the Vichy government and handed over to the Nazi authorities, and then extradited to Italian prisons, until Mussolini's collapse, he was freed. After the victory of the anti-fascist war, Nenni insisted on cooperating with the Communist Party. He said: "The reason why the Italian Socialist Party wants to unite with the Communist Party is because the Italian workers must unite to fight for the real democracy of Italy. People cannot stand in the middle of two roads, it is either this one or that one." He has twice been elected as the Deputy Prime Minister of the Italian Cabinet and served as the chairman of the Italian Socialist Party's parliamentary group.

　　Sforza—A member of the Italian reactionary party, the Christian Democratic Party, and currently the Foreign Minister of the Italian reactionary government, implementing a foreign policy that sells Italian interests to American monopoly capitalists.
