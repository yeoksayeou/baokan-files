    Celebrating the Complete Liberation of North China
    Just as our army is crossing the Yangtze River, amidst the victorious sounds of valiant advance, the complete liberation of the entire North China region has been announced. The news is invigorating the military and the people. This newspaper extends its warm greetings to our People's Liberation Army on the front lines and its lofty congratulations to the people of North China.
    The People's Liberation War in the North China region has now come to a victorious end. This is primarily due to the correct strategic guidance of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. As early as after the failure of the Great Revolution of 1925-27, Chairman Mao stipulated the strategic policy of the people's revolution, that is, under the leadership of the proletariat, creating revolutionary base areas and revolutionary armies in the countryside, implementing the encirclement of cities by the countryside, and finally capturing the cities. This brilliant strategic provision has proven to be completely correct and has already achieved brilliant victories. Secondly, it is due to the heroic struggle of the military and civilians in North China. Because the war we are waging is a just war of the people's revolution, we have been able to obtain the support of the broad masses of the people from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the anti-Chiang war. The reason why North China has achieved the liberation of the entire region is due to the heroic battles of the soldiers at the front and the enthusiastic transportation and support of the people in the rear. Furthermore, it is the result of the close cooperation of neighboring regions and fraternal People's Liberation Army units in joint operations. Recalling when the Kuomintang reactionaries undermined the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the once-held peace talks, launching an anti-people civil war, carrying the equipment of their master, American imperialism, they moved north from along the Longhai Railway, launched a frenzied offensive deep into the liberated areas, and boasted of eliminating the People's Liberation Army and the liberated areas in six months. Our military and civilians rose up to meet the challenge and carried out extremely arduous internal defense operations. In the second year of the war, our army turned from defense to offense. The North China Army crossed the Yellow River and cooperated with friendly forces to open up the Central Plains Liberated Area. Another large army in North China captured Shijiazhuang in one fell swoop. The original Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Areas were connected into one, forming the North China Liberated Area. Soon, with the assistance of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the largest city in North China, Beiping and Tianjin were also liberated. At this point, the enemy in North China had only a few remaining isolated points. However, elements like the traitor Yan Xishan continued to clamor, saying that his Taiyuan was an impregnable fortress, impossible to conquer forever. After a brief rest, our army launched attacks on the enemy in Taiyuan, Datong, Xinxiang, and Anyang. The remaining enemies were either annihilated or surrendered. The four remaining strongholds were completely liberated within twelve days. The complete liberation of the entire North China region is a matter worth writing about in a big way.
    The North China Liberated Area has a vast territory and abundant resources. It currently governs eight provinces and regions (Taiyue District, Taihang District, Chahar Province, Suiyuan Province, Jidong District, Jizhong District, Ji'nan District, and Ji-Lu-Yu District), 303 counties, and four directly-administered municipalities (Beiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang). Most of the region has already implemented land reform. Here we have hardworking, brave, long-tempered, and politically conscious people. Here we have a considerable industrial base, abundant mineral resources, fertile land, and a truly people's democratic government. We have all the conditions for developing industrial and agricultural production. A new era has begun for the people of North China, that is to say, the central task in the future will shift from war to construction. We must strive to restore and develop the production of the North China Liberated Area, change wartime production to peacetime production, improve the people's lives by developing production, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions that all four aspects (labor and capital, public and private, urban and rural, domestic and foreign) must be taken into account, and be diligent and thrifty in building a new China. Now our People's Liberation Army on all fronts is advancing victoriously, and the final victory of the whole country is not far off. We must continue to support the front lines by developing production.
    We must always pay attention, in the face of the victorious development situation, we should not have the slightest pride and complacency. On the contrary, we should always remember the lessons Chairman Mao has given us: "Be cautious and humble, guard against arrogance and impatience." This victory is great, but compared to the long-term construction work in the future, this is only the first step in the Long March. Inherit and carry forward the traditions of our party and our army, be diligent and thrifty, work hard in production, practice strict economy, and use every grain of rice and every penny that can be saved for production and construction, and strive to restore and develop the production of North China.

### 庆祝华北完全解放

    庆祝华北完全解放
    正当我军南渡长江，奋勇前进的胜利声中，华北全境宣告完全解放，消息传来，军民振奋。本报特向我前线人民解放军致热烈的敬礼，向华北人民致崇高的贺意。
    华北地区的人民解放战争，至此已胜利结束了。这首先是由于毛主席和党中央正确的战略指导。早在一九二五—二七年大革命失败后，毛主席就规定了人民革命的战略方针，即，在无产阶级领导下，在乡村创造革命根据地，革命军队，实行乡村包围城市，最后取得城市。这一英明的战略规定，证明了完全是正确的，而且已经获得了辉煌的胜利。其次是由于华北军民的英勇奋战。由于我们所进行的战争是人民的革命的正义的战争，所以从抗战以来直到此次反蒋战争，均能获得广大人民的支持，华北所以获得全境解放，就是由于前方战士的英勇作战，与后方人民的踊跃输将支援所致。复次是由各友邻区域和兄弟解放军密切配合共同作战的结果。回忆国民党反动派破坏了政协决议和一度和谈，发动反人民内战的时候，扛着其主子美国帝国主义的装备，其势汹汹不可一世，从陇海沿线向北出动，深入解放区实行疯狂进攻，侈言六个月消灭解放军和解放区。我军民则起而应战，进行了极艰苦的内线防御作战。战争进入第二年，我军则由防御转为进攻，华北大军横渡黄河，协同友军开辟了中原解放区，我华北另一路大军则一举而攻下石家庄，原晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫两大解放区连成一片，合而为华北解放区。不久在东北人民解放军协助下，华北最大城市平津亦告解放。至此，华北敌人只不过剩下几个残余孤点而已。但，象阎逆锡山之流，犹复叫嚣不已，说他的太原是金城汤池，永远攻不克。我军稍事休整后，对太原、大同、新乡、安阳之敌发起攻击，残敌或歼或降，十二天内四个残余据点完全解放。华北地区全境宣告完全解放，这是值得大书特书的一件事。
    华北解放区幅员广大，物产丰饶。现共辖有八个省区（太岳区、太行区、察哈尔省、绥远省、冀东区、冀中区、冀南区、冀鲁豫区），三百零三个县，四个直辖市（北平、天津、太原和石家庄）。人口五千八百三十六万。绝大部分地区，已经实行过土地改革。在这里有勤劳勇敢久经锻炼和政治觉悟很高的人民，在这里有相当规模的工业基础，丰饶的矿产，肥沃的土地，在这里有真正的人民民主政权，我们具备有发展工农业生产的一切条件。华北人民的新时代已经开始了，就是说，今后的中心任务要从战争转向建设，要努力把华北解放区的生产恢复和发展起来，把战时的生产改变为平时的生产，从发展生产中改善人民的生活，实行毛主席四方八面缺一不可的指示：劳资、公私、城乡、内外必须兼顾，克勤克俭，建设新中国。现在我各线人民解放军正在胜利进军，全国最后胜利已为期不远，我们要用发展生产，来继续支援前线。
    必须时刻注意，在胜利发展的形势面前，我们不应该有丝毫的骄傲自满。恰恰相反，我们应该时刻记住毛主席给予我们的教训：“谨慎谦虚、戒骄戒躁”。这个胜利是伟大的，但比之将来的长期建设工作，这仅仅是万里长征的第一步。继承和发扬我党我军的传统，克勤克俭，努力生产，厉行节约，把能够省出的一粒米、一文钱都用到生产建设上去，为恢复和发展华北的生产而奋斗。
