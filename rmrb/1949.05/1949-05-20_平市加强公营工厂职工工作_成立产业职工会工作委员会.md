　　Ping City Strengthens Work Among Public Factory Workers
  　Establishes Industrial Workers' Union Work Committee
    [Our Newspaper] To strengthen the leadership of the work of the trade unions in various public factories in Beiping, the city announced the establishment of the Industrial Workers' Union Work Committee at a meeting of trade union cadres from various factories yesterday (the 19th). The committee members are Zhang Hongshun (Chairman), Li Chen, Zheng Kefeng, Song Ting, etc. Comrade Zhang Hongshun also issued a challenge on behalf of the Industrial Workers' Union to the trade unions of various factories. The central aim is to oppose the phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline existing in factories, and to achieve: (1) Planned work and study; (2) Timely answers to questions raised below, without delay (except for those requiring instructions from higher authorities); (3) Work must be carried through to the end; (4) Do not exaggerate anything, be truthful. The factories are currently brewing conditions to accept the challenge. (Bai Qing)
