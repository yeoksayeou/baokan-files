Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 1st: The people of the Jianghuai liberated areas are fully supporting the People's Liberation Army in crossing the river. This area experienced two years of persistent struggle behind enemy lines and was only fully liberated at the beginning of this year. Most of the area south of the Huai River is newly liberated, but the people's enthusiasm for supporting the front lines is extremely high due to past suffering from the Kuomintang bandit gangs' destruction and oppression. More than a month ago, sub-districts had already established front-line support headquarters to lead the work of supporting the front lines. The people of the entire region actively and enthusiastically handed over and lent grain. Permanent civilian labor corps were organized to build railways, highways, and erect electric wires, forming a great movement to support the front lines.

When Yingmen District, Siyang County, mobilized and organized a permanent civilian labor corps, at a meeting of village cadres, 133 out of 166 people requested to depart. When Pixui County (a newly established county, formed from parts of Pi County and Suining County) mobilized and organized a permanent stretcher team, Chen Qichao, a poor peasant from urban and rural areas, said: "When the bandit troops were here, the Ba長 [village head] demanded money and beat me half to death. When I think about it today, I am really sad. This time, I must join the stretcher team and help the People's Liberation Army go to the Jiang 两 [both sides of the Yangtze River] to eliminate the Kuomintang bandit troops and take revenge." His words moved twenty-eight young people to immediately sign up to join the stretcher team. The people of Luhe County put forward the slogan "People rest, but the mill does not rest" during grain delivery, and mobilized all ten rice mills in the urban area to start work. In twenty days, they delivered 40,000 piculs of grain and milled it for the People's Liberation Army. When civilian laborers in Donglin District, Hanshan County, were building bridges, it was raining heavily, and the laborers were soaked to the bone, unable to open their eyes, but they still insisted on working and built five large bridges (totaling thirty-eight spans) in one day and night. The people of six counties, including Dingyuan, Fengyang, and Quanjiao, worked together and requisitioned 25 million catties of rice in half a month, and mobilized 200,000 civilian laborers to rush to transport it day and night. Along the transportation lines, each grain station was surrounded by a constant flow of people and vehicles, busily loading and unloading grain. The Fifth Sub-district (under the jurisdiction of six counties, including Chaoxian, Hexian, and Hanshan) established fifty grain stations throughout the sub-district, built 1,175 li of highways, 75 bridges, and completed the organization of 1,000 boats and more than 10,000 boatmen. Thanks to the people's high level of enthusiasm for supporting the front lines, the entire Jianghuai liberated area successfully requisitioned and borrowed a total of 60 million catties of rice, ensuring the supply of the People's Liberation Army. In addition to temporarily mobilizing 4,000 sets of stretchers, 12,000 sets of carrying poles, and 5,000 carts, the entire region organized 4,100 sets of permanent stretchers, 1,000 sets of carrying poles, and 6,000 carts. The permanent civilian laborers assured their elders at home: "Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, we will resolutely support them."

    帮助大军渡江消灭匪军
    江淮人民全力支前
    解放军打到那里，坚决支援到那里
    【新华社蚌埠一日电】江淮解放区各地人民正在全力支援解放军过江。该区过去曾经过二年的敌后坚持斗争，至今年初始全部获得解放。其淮河江南大部分为新解放区，但人民因过去遭受国民党匪帮摧残压迫，支前情绪极高。在一个多月以前，各分区即已成立支前司令部，领导支援前线工作。全区人民积极踊跃交粮借粮。组织常备民工团，修筑铁路、公路、架设电线，形成伟大的支援前线运动。
    泗阳县营门区动员组织常备民工时，在乡村干部会上，一百六十六人，有一百三十三人要求出发。邳睢县（新设县，邳县睢宁各一部）动员组织常备担架时，占城乡贫农陈起超说：“匪军在时，保长要款，把我打得死去活来。今天想起来，实在伤心。这次我一定要参加担架队，帮助解放军到江两去消灭国民党匪军报仇。”他的话感动了二十八个青年立即报名参加担架队。六合县人民在缴粮中提出“人息碾不息”的口号，并将城区十家碾米厂全部动员开工，二十天中即缴粮四万石，并碾好送给人民解放军。含山县东林区民工在修筑桥梁时，正大雨，民工们全身淋湿，眼睛都睁不开，但仍坚持着工作，在一昼夜中修筑了五座大桥（计三十八孔）。定远、凤阳、全椒等六个县人民一齐动手下，在半个月中即征好二千五百万斤大米，动员二十万民工星夜赶运。在交通线上每个粮站的周围澈夜汇成人流车流，忙碌地起卸装运粮食。五分区（辖巢县、和县、含山等六个县）在全分区设立了五十个粮站，修筑公路一千一百七十五里，桥梁七十五座，并完成一千条船及万余船工的组织工作。由于人民发挥了高度的支前热情，总计全江淮解放区共顺利征借六千万斤大米，保证了人民解放军的供应。全区除临时动员四千付担架、一万二千付挑子、五千辆小车外，并组织了常备担架四千一百付，挑子一千付，小车六千辆，常备民工们向家乡父老保证：“解放军打到哪里，我们坚决支援到哪里”。
