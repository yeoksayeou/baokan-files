    The Communist Youth League Branches Established in Three Units Including the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China People's Government
    [Our Newspaper] In the memorial meeting held on the evening of the 4th by the three organizations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China People's Government, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Cooperative Committee, the New Democratic Youth League branch was established, and the league was made public. Comrade Song Shaowen, Minister of Agriculture, spoke at the meeting, expounding that intellectuals must and can only have a bright future by combining with workers and peasants, otherwise they will accomplish nothing. The Youth League branch then made a summary report. The report pointed out that the Youth League organization in the agency had serious left-leaning thoughts and closed-doorism in the past, which affected the expansion and consolidation of the League. It also pointed out that the work of the League has been fruitful, and many League members and non-League youths have corrected their work attitudes and promoted a positive and responsible work style due to the role of the League. But what should be emphasized is that the League must make itself the core organization of the broad masses of young people in the future, and it must better master criticism and self-criticism to correct shortcomings. Subsequently, the Party branch committee introduced the League Constitution and called on young people to study hard and work actively. Yao Yilin, Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, pointed out that intellectual cadres must put down their airs and integrate with workers and peasants to serve the people wholeheartedly. Worker-peasant cadres must put down their sense of superiority of "good component" and learn culture to improve themselves. He called on every young person to use his own work performance to make himself a glorious Communist Party member or Youth League member. In the free speech, many comrades encouraged everyone to work and study better with their own ideological transformation process and experience. Comrade Gu Ping used his own experience to prove that as long as you follow the Communist Party and serve the people well, even the biggest shortcomings will gradually be corrected.

    【本报讯】华北人民政府财委会、工商部、合作委员会三机关，四日晚上举行的纪念大会上，成立了新民主主义青年团团支部，公开了团。会上有农业部长宋劭文同志讲话，阐述知识分子必须、也只有与工人农民结合起来，才有光明前途，否则将一事无成。随由团支部作总结报告。报告中指出该机关中的青年团组织在过去严重存在着左倾思想及关门主义倾向，以致影响了团的扩大与巩固。又指出团的工作是有成绩的，不少的团员及非团青年因团的作用，端正了工作态度，发扬了积极负责的优良作风。但着重指出的是：团今后一定要使自己成为广大青年群众的核心组织，要更好的掌握批评与自我批评，以改正缺点。继由党支委介绍了团章，号召青年努力学习，积极工作。团支部副书记宣布了团的组织及团员名单。工商部部长姚依林同志，指出知识分子干部一定要放下架子与工农结合，全心全意为人民服务。工农干部一定要放下“成份好”的优越感，学习文化，提高自己。他号召每个青年都要以自己的工作表现，使自己成为一个光荣的共产党员或青年团员。自由讲话中，很多同志都以自己的思想转变过程及经验来勉励大家更好的工作与学习。谷平同志以自己的经验，证明了只要跟着共产党好好为人民服务，再大的缺点也会逐渐改过来的。    （胡明）
