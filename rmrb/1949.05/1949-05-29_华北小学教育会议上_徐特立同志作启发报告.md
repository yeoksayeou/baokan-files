　　North China Elementary Education Conference
  　Comrade Xu Teli Delivers an Enlightening Report
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Elementary Education Conference continued yesterday (the 28th) at the Xiehe Auditorium. Representatives from various regions exchanged experiences. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Xu Teli, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered an enlightening report. Comrade Xu first explained the importance the Communist Party attaches to elementary education. In the ten-point program written by Marx, the first six points address revolution, and the last four points address construction. Among them, three points address economic construction, and one point addresses elementary education, advocating that all children should receive education, which is one of our revolutionary goals. Elementary education should be linked to production, and everyone should participate in economic construction, so everyone must be cultured. Without culture, there is no possibility of industrialization and electrification. Then, what should we teach? Lenin once proposed, "critically absorb all cultural heritage of mankind," including the cultural heritage of slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society, remove the empty and meaningless content, correct the distortions of facts, and absorb what is needed by the people. Finally, Comrade Xu talked about the past discussions on education often involving moral education, intellectual education, and physical education. Do we need these? He affirmed that we do, but the content is different. He explained in detail how our morality, ethics, moral education, intellectual education, and physical education are essentially different from the past.
    Subsequently, Comrade Guo Lin, principal of the Yucai Primary School of the North China Bureau, reported on the school's experiences over the past few years. He excitedly described how the school's faculty and staff led hundreds of children from Yan'an and traveled thousands of miles to the Taihang Mountains. He emphasized that the school's greatest characteristic is the very harmonious relationship between teachers and students. Subsequently, Comrade Li Jincai, principal of Zhou Longhua Primary School in Central Hebei, reported on how the school combined students' learning with production during the busy farming season and achieved great results. Comrade Yi Wei, Director of the Shijiazhuang Education Bureau, and Comrade Han Zuoli of the Yucai Primary School of the North China Bureau, gave detailed accounts of the transformation of old education and the education of students.

　　华北小学教育会议上
  　徐特立同志作启发报告
    【本报讯】华北小学教育会议，昨（二十八日）继续在协和礼堂开会。各地相互交流经验。会议之初，由中共中央委员会委员徐特立同志作启发报告。徐老首先说明共产党对小学教育的重视。在马克斯写的十条党纲中，前六条是讲革命的，后四条是讲建设的。其中三条讲经济建设，一条讲的就是小学教育，主张一切儿童都要受教育，这是我们革命目标之一。小学教育要和生产联系起来，经济建设一切人都要参加，所以人人要有文化，没有文化就谈不到工业化、电气化。接着谈教什么东西？列宁曾提出，“批判的吸收人类的一切文化遗产”，包括奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会的文化遗产，要把它空洞无内容的东西去掉，把歪曲事实的东西纠正；吸收其为人民所需要的东西。最后徐老谈到过去谈教育常讲德育、智育、体育，我们要不要呢？他肯定的说，我们是要的，但内容不同，他详尽的说明了我们的道德、伦理、德育、智育、体育，和过去本质上如何不同。
    继由华北局育才完小校长郭林同志报告该校数年来之经历，他十分兴奋的叙述该校教职员由延安率领数百儿童行程数千里到达太行山，他着重的报告了该校的最大特征--师生之间十分融洽的关系。继由冀中周龙华完小校长李金才同志报告了该校在农忙中如何使学生的学习与生产结合而收到很大的成果。石家庄教育局长一苇同志、华北局育才小学韩作黎同志关于改造旧教育及教育学生的情形，均作了详细的叙述。
