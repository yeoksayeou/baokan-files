The Faculty and Staff of Tsinghua, Peking, and Normal Universities
　　Launch Salary Assessment Work
　　Adopting a Democratic Assessment Method of Self-Reporting and Public Discussion

　　[Our Newspaper] Since the Beiping Cultural Management Committee announced the salary standards for faculty and staff of national universities and colleges in Beiping, Tsinghua, Peking, and Normal Universities have successively launched salary assessment work. Tsinghua began assessment on the 11th of this month, and as of yesterday (the 21st), the assessment work has been largely completed. Peking and Normal Universities are currently learning from Tsinghua's experience and continuing the assessment. The Tsinghua University Professors' Association had drafted a temporary method for calculating branch salaries, adopting a point system with seniority and academic qualifications as the assessment criteria. After discussion by all professors, self-reporting and public discussion were conducted democratically within the departments. In terms of academic qualifications, points were calculated based on papers and monographs. In terms of seniority, points were calculated annually starting from university graduation (or equivalent qualifications), with a certain progressive method adopted. After the assessment, the vast majority of professors expressed satisfaction. For lecturers and teaching assistants, they were divided into three levels: lecturers, instructors, and teaching assistants. The assessment was based on work performance and seniority. The work performance category was divided into service, technology, and academic, with different weightings compared to professors. The salary levels adopted a cross-progressive system, also assessed through self-reporting and public discussion. For staff members, the assessment criteria were based on three items: service performance, job position, and seniority. The weighting of points was 30 percent for seniority, 40 percent for service performance, and 30 percent for job position. In addition to self-assessment and mutual assessment, the heads of each work unit made the final assessment. The assessment for workers and guards was divided into three categories: technicians, skilled workers, and ordinary workers. The scoring criteria were based on technical ability, work attitude, and seniority, but the proportion of the three differed among the various types of workers. Salaries were assessed using a cross-progressive method.

　　This salary assessment work for Tsinghua faculty and staff was serious and strict. Although some people adopted a passive attitude, waiting for the assessment, and some started solely from personal interests, requesting higher assessments, their sense of ownership and overall perspective in the work was still insufficient. The majority of people correctly recognized that this was a self-assessment and that they were responsible to the country and the people. In this salary assessment work, the staff also realized that to do a good job, it is necessary to connect with the masses' thinking and implement the mass line.

　　清华北大师大教职员工
  　展开薪给评定工作
    采取自报公议民主评定办法
    【本报讯】自北平文管会公布北平国立大学院校教职员工薪给标准后，清华、北大、师大均相继展开薪给评定工作，清华自本月十一日开始评定，截至昨日（二十一日）止，评定工作已大致告一段落。北大、师大现正吸取清华经验继续进行评定中。清华大学教授联谊会曾拟制计分支薪临时办法采取积点制，以年资学术为评定标准，经过全体教授商讨后，在系的单位中进行自报公议，民主评定。学术方面，以论文、专著计分。年资方面，从大学毕业（或同等学历）算起，按年计分，并采取一定累进办法。经过评定后，绝大多数教授均认为满意，讲助教方面，分讲师、讲员、助教三级，按工作成绩与年资评定，工作成绩一项分服务、技术、学术三种，三者比重与教授不同，薪级采交叉累进制，亦以自报公议评定。职员方面，评定标准是根据服务成绩、工作职位、年资三项，计分比重年资占百分之三十，服务成绩占百分之四十，工作职位占百分之三十，除自评互评外，再由各工作单位负责人作最后评定。工警方面的评定，分技工、熟练工、普通工三类。计分标准按技术能力、劳动态度、年资三项，但在各类工人中三者所占的比重不同，按交叉累进的办法评薪。
    此次清华教职员工薪给评定工作是认真严格的，虽然还有些人采取消极态度，等待评定，有些人单从个人利益出发，要求评定得高一些；在工作中的主人翁感觉与全面观点尚不够。大部分人都正确地认识到这次是自己来评薪，并对国家和人民负责。在这次评薪工作中，工作人员亦认识到要做好工作必须打通群众思想，实行群众路线。
