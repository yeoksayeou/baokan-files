Military Vehicle Accident
　Driver Sentenced to Imprisonment
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Peiping People's Court has accepted more than ten cases of car accidents resulting in death or injury to pedestrians, and is carefully handling them one by one. The drivers responsible for the accidents will be sentenced to imprisonment based on the degree of their negligence and the severity of the circumstances. The circumstances of two recently concluded car accident cases are as follows: (1) Wu Mingshan, the driver of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit who hit and injured rickshaw puller Sun Jixing and passenger Wu Zhen (63 years old) on the road outside the west gate of Yenching University on April 14, has been sentenced to three years of imprisonment. He is currently detained in prison and will be sent back to his unit to atone for his crime after a certain period of education. His unit will provide Wu Zhen with funeral and consolation expenses of 40,000 people's currency, and will be responsible for rickshaw puller Sun Jixing's medical expenses, rickshaw repair fees, and temporary living expenses. (2) Wu Bingyu, the driver from a certain unit of the North China Military Region who killed an elderly woman, Zhang Yu (64 years old), at Dengshikou in the eastern city on May 6th at 10:00 AM, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a three-year reprieve, and sent back to the Seventh Division of the North China Military Region Headquarters to atone for his crime. The military region will provide the deceased with funeral expenses of 37,000 people's currency and consolation money of 400 catties of millet. According to the court's investigation of several accidents, while car drivers should bear the primary responsibility, pedestrians and slow-moving vehicles should also pay attention to cars at all times. Especially when crossing the road, they should be careful about approaching cars in order to reduce accidents. For example, in the accident that occurred at Dengshikou on May 6th, the elderly couple Zhang Xuefeng and Zhang Yu were pushing a water cart from east to west across the road and failed to pay attention to the passing cars. When Wu Bingyu's car was 25 meters away from them, he honked the horn, but they ignored it. The car's brakes were faulty, and it could not stop in time, resulting in Zhang Yu being seriously injured and dying shortly after being sent to the hospital.

　　军用汽车肇祸
  　司机判处徒刑
    【本报讯】北平人民法院已先后接受十余起汽车肇祸轧毙人命或撞伤行人案件，正陆续慎重处理中。对于肇祸之司机，将分别依其过失大小，情节轻重处以徒刑。最近审结之两件汽车肇祸案情形如下：（一）四月十四日在燕京大学西校门马路撞伤三轮车夫孙继兴及乘客武珍（六十三岁）之某高射炮部队司机吴明山，已判处有期徒刑三年，现在押于监狱，俟经过一定教育后；送部队戴罪立功；由其所属部队给予武珍葬埋费及抚恤费人民券四万元，并负责三车轮夫孙继兴医药费、三轮车修理费及临时生活费。（二）五月六日上午十时在东城灯市口撞毙老妇张于氏（六十四岁）之华北军区某部司机吴炳玉，判处有期徒刑一年，缓刑三年，送回华北军区司令部第七处戴罪立功；由军区给予死者葬埋费人民券三万七千元，抚恤费小米四百斤。根据法院审理的几次车祸发生情形，汽车司机固应负主要责任，但行人及慢车亦应随时注意汽车，在横穿马路时尤应留神有无汽车驶过，才能减少车祸。例如五月六日灯市口发生之车祸，当时系张学增及张于氏老夫妇推水车由东向西横穿马路，未能注意往来汽车。当吴炳玉开驶之汽车驶至距其二十五米时曾按喇叭，他们并未理会，汽车因塞带不灵，停车不及，致将张于氏撞伤甚重，送至医院后旋即身死。
