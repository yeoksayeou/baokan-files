　　Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Federation
　　Congratulates the Liberation of Shanghai
　　Pays Tribute to Chairman Mao and Others
Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 29th: The Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Federation telegraphed Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and General Chen Yi on the 27th to congratulate them on the liberation of Shanghai, saying: "Chairman Mao, leader of the Chinese people, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Chen Yi of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters: The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Shanghai, China's largest city, on May 25th. This not only frees the six million citizens of Shanghai from the cruelties of the Kuomintang butchers, allowing them to stand tall and forever follow the Chinese Communist Party, but also returns the largest base for imperialists as a colony to the hands of the Chinese people. We hereby send our respects. We will resolutely fight under the leadership of Chairman Mao to completely eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and build a new democratic China. Ma Xulun, Zhou Jianren, Lin Handa, Hu Ziying, Xu Guangping, Shen Zhiyuan, Luo Shuzhang, Ge Zhicheng, and Wang Shao'ao, Directors of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Federation, May 27, 1949."
