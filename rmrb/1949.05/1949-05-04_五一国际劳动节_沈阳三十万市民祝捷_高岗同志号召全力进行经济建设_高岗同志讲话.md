Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: Yesterday, 300,000 citizens of Shenyang gathered to commemorate the first "May First" International Labor Day after liberation, and at the same time, to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing. A total of 170,000 industrial workers, laborers from all walks of life, soldiers, students, and public employees gathered in the municipal government square. 130,000 citizens held commemorative events in separate districts. The whole city was decorated with lanterns and colorful banners, and hundreds of Yangko teams paraded with drums and gongs. At dawn, the masses gathered in the municipal government square and began to enter the venue. The officers and soldiers of the Chongqing warship, who had revolted, stood at the forefront of the venue, holding high red flags.

In front of the decorated stand were displayed cannons and tanks, while bombers and fighter planes swept across the clear sky.

Under the decorated stand in front of the Municipal Government, a 15-centimeter caliber cannon named "Jiangnan" was displayed, along with two tanks named "May First" and "Labor," and thirty-six American-made milled steel guns. On the left side of the venue were also large trucks pulling forty American-made cannons of various calibers and six tanks. These were all weapons repaired by workers of a certain military factory as a "May First" gift. Around the venue, hundreds of propaganda trucks, command vehicles, and ambulances patrolled back and forth. At 9:00 AM, three American-made "B25" bombers and two "P51" fighter planes swept across the clear sky, and countless colorful streamers and leaflets fluttered down. The revolting air force, arrayed and soaring over the airspace of the people's country for the first time, received enthusiastic cheers from the audience. At this time, the loudspeakers broadcast the great victory of our army in Jiangnan, annihilating eight enemy corps, and the whole audience cheered even more. At 9:40 AM, the flares of ten signal cannons rose into the air, followed by four hundred salutes fired by twenty cannons, and the red flag on the roof of the Municipal Government building slowly rose with the singing of the Internationale. The assembly was declared open. The assembly began with representatives of military workers handing over the cannons and tanks they had repaired to the People's Liberation Army, followed by opening remarks by Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and a speech by Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

In his speech, Gao Gang described the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in crossing the Yangtze River and advancing south in just ten days, and then pointed out that the Kuomintang government had already been destroyed, and now only garbage heaps scattered in Guangzhou, Taiwan, Chongqing, Yulin, and other places remained. The task of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army is to bravely advance and quickly clean up these garbage heaps, and thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang's remaining reactionary forces. He then pointed out that after the Soviet Red Army defeated the Japanese invaders, for three years, the people of Northeast China carried out a great land reform movement, eliminated 1.08 million Kuomintang bandit troops equipped by American imperialism, and sent one million Northeast people's soldiers into the customs to cooperate with the North China People's Liberation Army and eliminate the North China enemy. Now they are carrying out the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to completely eliminate all Kuomintang reactionary remnants. In the future, the task of all the people in our rear is to devote all our efforts to economic construction, develop industry and agriculture, especially to restore and develop industry. The working class, which has become the leading class of the new democratic regime, should actively produce and become a model for all the people. The armed forces must strive to study politics, culture, and master technology, so as to more effectively eliminate the Kuomintang's remaining reactionary forces, and prepare to crush at any time the attacks of the aggressive war group headed by American imperialism. He concluded by saying: Our struggle is not isolated. The Soviet Union, the world's fortress of peace and democracy led by the great Stalin, and the vast people of all countries in the world, including Britain and the United States, who love peace and democracy, stand with us. We have full confidence that we can overcome all imperialist interference in the Chinese revolution and the remaining military forces of the Kuomintang. We will certainly liberate all of China. After speeches by Zhao Chengyi, a representative of workers from the Shenyang Textile Factory, and others, the assembly passed a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Marshal Stalin, the World Peace Congress, and others. At this point, the assembly ended, and 170,000 people held a grand parade. In the evening, factories and government offices throughout the city held evening parties.

    高岗同志讲话
    【新华社沈阳二日电】昨日沈阳市三十万人集会纪念解放后的第一个“五一”国际劳动节，同时庆祝南京解放。沈市产业职工、各业劳动者、军人、学生及公教人员共十七万人集中在市政府广场举行集会。十三万市民则分区举行纪念，全市挂灯结彩，红旗飘扬，数百队秧歌队锣鼓喧天。天刚黎明，市政府广场与会群众即开始进入会场。起义的重庆号海军官兵高举红旗立于会场前列。
  彩楼前陈列大炮坦克，轰炸机驱逐机掠过晴空。
    市府门前彩楼下陈列着一门命名为“江南号”的十五生的口径的加农炮，两辆命名为“五一号”和“劳动号”的坦克和三十六挺美式铣钢枪。会场左侧还有大卡车牵引的四十门美制各种口径大炮和六辆坦克。这些都是某军兵工厂工人作为“五一”献礼所修理好的武器。会场四周，成百辆宣传卡车、指挥车、救护车在来往巡回。九时，美制三架“Ｂ２５”式轰炸机和两架“Ｐ５１”式驱逐机掠过晴空，无数的彩条传单缤纷而下。首次列阵翱翔于人民国家领空的起义空军受到全场群众的热烈欢呼。此时，广播器又传出江南我军歼敌八个军的大捷，全场更欢声雷动。九时四十分，十门信号炮的照明弹腾空而起，接着二十门礼炮鸣炮四百响，市府楼顶红旗随着国际歌声徐徐上升，大会宣告开始。大会首由军工工人代表以自己修理的大炮、坦克移交解放军，继由东北行政委员会主席林枫致开会词及中共中央东北局书记高岗的讲话。
    高岗在讲话中叙述渡江南进的解放大军短短十天内的伟大战绩后，指出国民党政府已经灭亡，现在不过剩下散处广州、台湾、重庆、榆林等地的垃圾堆。中国人民与人民解放军的任务就是奋勇向前，迅速地把这些垃圾堆打扫干净，彻底肃清国民党残余反动势力。接着他指出，苏联红军打败日寇后，三年来，东北人民进行了伟大的土地改革运动，消灭了美国帝国主义装备起来的一百零八万国民党匪军，并送出了一百万东北人民子弟兵入关，配合华北人民解放军，消灭了华北敌人。现在他们正执行毛主席、朱总司令的命令，彻底消灭一切国民党反动残余力量。今后我们后方全体人民的任务，就是全力进行经济建设，发展工业和农业，特别是恢复与发展工业。成为新民主主义政权的领导阶级的工人，应该积极生产，成为全体人民的模范。武装部队则要努力学习政治，学习文化，掌握技术，以便更加有力地消灭国民党残余反动势力，和准备随时粉碎以美国帝国主义为首的制造侵略战争集团的袭击。他最后说：我们的斗争不是孤立的，伟大的斯大林所领导的全世界和平民主堡垒苏联以及世界各国包括英美在内的爱好和平与民主的广大人民都与我们站在一起。我们有充足的信心能够战胜一切帝国主义对中国革命的干涉和国民党残余军事力量。我们一定能解放全中国。在沈阳纺织厂工人代表赵承义等讲话后，大会通过致电毛主席、朱总司令、斯大林元帅、世界和平大会等致敬。至此，大会结束，十七万人举行大游行。入夜，全市工厂机关分别举行晚会。
