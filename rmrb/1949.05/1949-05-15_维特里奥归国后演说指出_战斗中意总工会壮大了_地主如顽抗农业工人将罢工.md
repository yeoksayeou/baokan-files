Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS reports: The General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, after returning from the Soviet Union from attending the Tenth Congress of Soviet Trade Unions, delivered a speech at a mass rally of working people in Rome. Vittorio expressed satisfaction with the significant achievements of the General Confederation of Labor in opposing the provocative attitude of employers and the conspiracies of splitters of the trade union movement. He pointed out that the General Confederation of Labor has become stronger and more closely united after this struggle, creating the possibility of reaching agreements to satisfy some demands of industrial workers. During the negotiations with the Confederation of Industrialists next week, the General Confederation of Labor "will never give up any bit of the legitimate demands of the working people." Regarding the status of agricultural laborers, Vittorio stated that the situation remains tense, and agricultural workers and many peasants are forced to intensify their struggle against the landlords, who stubbornly refuse any modification of contracts and daily wages. Vittorio finally stated that if the situation does not change, agricultural laborers, who are conducting a united struggle nationwide, will be forced to hold a general strike on May 16.

    维特里奥归国后演说指出
    战斗中意总工会壮大了
    地主如顽抗农业工人将罢工
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社讯：意大利总工会总书记维特里奥自苏联出席苏联职工会第十次代表大会返国后，在罗马劳动人民群众大会上发表演说。维特里奥对总工会在反对雇主们的挑衅态度及工会运动分裂分子的阴谋方面所获得的重大成就，表示满意。他指出：总工会经过这一斗争后，已更加壮大、更加紧密地团结，造成了获致满足产业工人某些要求之协议的可能。在下周与工业家联合会谈判中间，总工会“决不放弃劳动人民任何一点点的合法要求”。关于农业劳动者的地位，维特里奥称：现在的情形仍然紧张，农业工人及很多农民被迫加紧他们对地主的斗争，后者顽固地拒绝一切修改合同及每日工资的要求。维特里奥最后称，如果情形不变，正在全国范围内进行联合斗争的农业劳工，将被迫于五月十六日举行总罢工。
