　　The Preliminary Plan of the Peking Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Production and Trade Union Work
　　This is a work plan formulated by the Peking Municipal Committee on April 17, 1949, based on the "Decision on Current Central Work." In order to enable readers to better understand the spirit of the Peking Municipal Committee's "Decision" and the specific implementation steps and methods, this plan is hereby published together.
　　Editor's Note

　　In order to effectively restore, transform, and develop production in Peking, and strive for a swift increase in Peking's production, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over production and the administrative and trade union work in public enterprises.

　　Specific plans are hereby stipulated as follows:

　　A. On restoring, transforming, and developing production:

　　(1) Regarding public enterprises: First, a one-year production plan must be quickly formulated to plan for the procurement of raw materials and equipment, calculate costs, promote sales of finished products, and conduct production in a planned manner. Second, the structure, personnel, and salaries must be quickly adjusted, removing obstacles in factories that hinder workers' enthusiasm for production. Third, progressive workers and technical experts should be absorbed to strengthen factory leadership, improve or establish factory management committees, and establish a centralized management system and good labor discipline on a democratic basis. The factory management committee should include technical experts and worker representatives accounting for half of the committee, and work under the leadership of military representatives and factory directors or managers. Fourth, necessary guarantees and possible improvements should be made to workers' lives and welfare. Fifth, strengthen the security work of the factory and strictly prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries. To this end, each enterprise should establish a security committee and a worker picket team.

　　(2) Regarding private enterprises: First, workers and capitalists should truly understand the Party's policy of "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital." On the basis of mutual benefit, labor-capital relations should be adjusted as unified as possible by industry. All labor-capital relations resolutions should be passed through the General Trade Union and reported to the Labor Bureau for approval. We must not only organize and educate workers to understand the Party's policies and actively engage in production, but also educate capitalists and organize capitalists to actively engage in production. Second, the supply and marketing of raw materials and finished products, as well as the operating conditions of private factories and workshops, should be thoroughly investigated, and a production guidance plan should be formulated for them, such as whether to expand operations, reduce operations, or change industries.

　　(3) Regarding handicrafts: First, guidance should be given to handicraft workshops and independent handicraftsmen regarding the direction of production, based on raw materials, sales, and the overall production and trade situation of the city, helping them purchase raw materials and promote the sale of finished products. Second, the independent handicraftsmen should be helped to organize supply and marketing cooperatives in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner, and handicraft production cooperatives should be organized under the conditions of state orders. For handicraft workshops with sales channels and beneficial to the people's livelihood, assistance should be given to develop them and improve their production technology, and the regulations of cooperatives should be formulated quickly. Third, the integration of factories, workshops, and family handicrafts should be studied and promoted and improved, but care should be taken not to disrupt their original reasonable connections.

　　(4) Regarding the production of government organs: First, small-scale machine-produced factories, workshops, and public farms and other production enterprises can be established first. Second, promote the spare-time production of government personnel. Third, unified leadership, decentralized management, and a reasonable division of labor should be implemented for the production of government organs. To this end, the municipal-level directly affiliated government organs should establish a unified production committee. In addition, the unified purchase and distribution of daily necessities and office supplies for government organs should be organized to avoid competitive purchases. Fourth, in addition to the retail departments or unified stores selling the products of government organs, government organs are prohibited from engaging in commerce.

　　(5) In order to fully understand and grasp the situation of industry and commerce, so as to facilitate unified planning and guidance, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce should handle the registration of industry and commerce in the city, strengthen the leadership and management of various major commodity exchanges and markets, and organize a unified price negotiation committee to negotiate the prices of some major products of public enterprises to prevent and overcome the anarchic state in this regard. However, private enterprises can only be guided in the general direction at present. Secondly, urban-rural trade and foreign trade should be effectively organized. In addition to the Trade Bureau giving full play to its role, merchants who have previously engaged in urban-rural trade and import and export trade should be properly organized and utilized to solve the problems of raw materials and sales channels.

　　(6) The competent authorities of banking and taxation should, according to the Party's policies of restoring and developing production and taking into account both public and private interests, jointly and specifically study and stipulate with the enterprise management departments which public and private enterprises should be encouraged and developed, which should be restricted, and how to attract capital and invest in the construction of public enterprises, support private industries, and review the implementation of financial and tax policies in order to gradually improve them step by step.

　　(7) In order to rapidly restore and develop agricultural production in the suburbs:

　　First, the suburbs should be finally delineated immediately, and the agricultural land problem should be solved. Second, according to the specific characteristics of the suburbs, the rented land of landlords and rich peasants should be confiscated and returned to the public, and should not be divided equally. In general, the original cultivation and original use should be maintained, and it should be guaranteed that whoever plants it harvests it. Third, on the basis of the individual economy and on the principle of voluntariness, agricultural labor mutual aid and cooperation in rural handicrafts and sideline production should be promoted, and farmer supply and marketing cooperatives should be established. Fourth, farmer reception centers and freight yards should be established in the city, and a market for agricultural products should be established by the government to promote economic exchanges between urban and rural areas.

　　(8) Publicly owned houses in the city should be planned as a whole, adjusted for use, and properly repaired and protected; the ownership of houses privately owned by the people should be guaranteed. The rent shall be freely negotiated by both the landlord and the tenant, and if there is any dispute, the government shall mediate according to the original conditions agreed upon by both parties. Those that belong to the property of the chief war criminals that should be confiscated must be executed by court judgment.

　　In short, all measures related to the national economy must be conducive to the rapid restoration and development of production; otherwise, they are unnecessary or even wrong. The Finance and Economics Committee should immediately formulate a more specific implementation plan.

　　B. Plan for trade union work:

　　(1) In order to restore, transform, and develop production and carry out various urban construction works, the vast majority of manual and intellectual laborers who earn wages or salaries by selling their labor force should be systematically organized into trade unions within one or two years. First, industrial trade unions should be established and improved systematically so that organized and conscious industrial workers can play a leading role in various trade unions. Industrial trade union organizations should be established in all kinds of public and private enterprises. Second, the trade union of handicraft workers should be organized. It is necessary to organize workers from various industries to join the trade union of handicraft workers in a focused, step-by-step, and prepared manner. Only handicraft workers who rely on wage labor for a living should be allowed to join the trade union of handicraft workers. When organizing handicraft workers, tendencies toward guildism should be prevented. A group of industrial workers and revolutionary intellectual cadres should be sent to help and participate in leading the work of the trade union of handicraft workers. Third, shop assistants trade unions should be organized. Preparations should be made and focus should be given to organizing in large stores first, and gradually organizing shop assistants from various industries to join the shop assistants trade union. Membership in the shop assistants trade union should be limited to wage laborers in commerce. There is often a tendency toward guildism among shop assistants, and attention must be paid to preventing and overcoming it. Fourth, the coolies and transport workers trade union should be organized. Preparations should be made and focus should be given to organizing various types of coolies and transport workers to join the coolies and transport workers trade union. Employees in the rural suburbs can also organize their own trade unions and join the coolies trade union. Fifth, staff engaged in cultural and educational work who earn salaries should also be organized into trade unions. The current teachers' unions and other cultural and educational workers' groups should immediately unite to discuss the issue of organizing cultural and educational workers' trade unions. Sixth, all government employees, workers and miscellaneous personnel should also be organized into trade unions. However, due to the current heavy workload, the organization can be postponed.

　　(2) The training of trade union cadres should be immediately stepped up, and student intellectuals who are determined to do trade union work should be recruited to enrich the cadre force for trade union work, and workers' training classes should continue to be run and expanded, and workers' schools should be established.

　　(3) In principle, various demands of workers to improve their lives should be appropriately resolved under possible conditions. Although it is difficult to make general improvements in economic life at present due to the war and difficult economic conditions, efforts should also be made to ensure that the actual living standards of workers are not lowered and the original welfare of workers is maintained in order to increase workers' enthusiasm for production. For labor disputes in private industry and commerce, both labor and management should be persuaded to reach an agreement on the basis of restoring and developing production and benefiting both labor and management, or mediated or approved by the General Trade Union and the Labor Bureau. At present, all labor disputes must be resolved quickly and uniformly by the General Trade Union and the Labor Bureau, industry by industry.

　　(4) The problem of unemployed workers can only be gradually resolved in the process of developing production. Some people should be dispersed to the countryside if possible.

　　(5) The Party, the government, and the administration of public enterprises must closely rely on the workers and the workers' trade unions. The Party must send the best cadres to do production and trade union work, cultivate trade union work cadres to closely contact the masses, and establish the belief of trade unions and their cadres among the masses, so as to more effectively assist and guarantee the factory director's leadership over production.

　　(6) In all public factories, factory management committees should be established under the leadership of military representatives and factory directors, and the democratization of factory management should be implemented step by step under centralized guidance, that is, democracy under centralized guidance, to reform factory management, so that factory administrative work truly follows the mass line, and worker representative meetings should be held regularly with preparation.

    乙、关于工会工作的计划：
    （一）为了恢复改造与发展生产及进行城市各项建设工作，必须有步骤地、在一、二年内、系统地把绝大多数靠出卖自己劳动力取得工资或薪水为生的体力劳动者与智力劳动者，组织到工会中来。第一、首先系统地建立与健全各产业工会，以便使有组织、有觉悟的产业工人，在各种职工会中起带头作用。在公私各种企业中，都应该有产业工会的组织。第二、应组织手工业工人工会。应有重点、有步骤、有准备地按照手工业的不同行业，组织各业的工人加入手工业工人工会。加入手工业工人工会应只限于靠工钱劳动为生的手工工人。在组织手工业工人时，应防止行会主义倾向。要派一部分产业工人和革命知识分子的干部去帮助和参加领导手工业工人工会的工作。第三、应组织店员工会。要有准备、有重点地首先在大商店中进行组织，并逐渐组织各业的店员加入店员工会。店员工会的会只限员于商业中的工钱劳动者。在店员中也往往存在着行会主义倾向，也必须注意予以防止和克服。第四、应组织苦力运输工人工会。应有准备、有重点地组织各种类的苦力运输工人加入苦力运输工会。近郊农村的雇工也可以组织自己的工会，并加入苦力工会。第五、靠薪金为生的从事文化教育事业的工作人员，也应该组织到工会中来。目前的教职员联合会及其他文化教育工作人员的团体，应即联合起来商讨组织文教工作人员工会的问题。第六、一切政府机关的职员、工役与杂务人员，也应该组织到工会中来。但现在由于工作繁忙，可以从缓组织。
    （二）应立即加紧训练工会工作干部，并吸收决心做工会工作的学生知识分子参加，以充实工会工作的干部，并继续开办和扩大工人训练班，开办职工学校。
    （三）对于工人改善生活的各项要求，在可能条件下，原则上应予以适当的解决。目前虽因处在战争期间，经济情况困难，经济生活难于作普遍之改善，但也应努力保障不降低工人的实际生活水平，维持工人原有的福利，以便提高工人生产的积极性。对于私营工商业中的劳资争议，应说服劳资双方在恢复与发展生产和劳资两利的基础上获得协议，或由总工会与劳动局加以调解或批准。目前一切劳资争议，必须迅速地由总工会和劳动局一行业一行业地予以统一的解决。
    （四）失业工人问题只能在发展生产的过程中，逐渐解决。有些人在可能条件下疏散下乡。
