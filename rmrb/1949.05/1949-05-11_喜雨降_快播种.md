Welcome Rain, Hurry to Sow

Recently, good news has been frequently reported: rain has fallen successively in various places, and some areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and eastern Hebei have been thoroughly soaked. Last night, welcome rain also fell near Beiping. It is estimated that the rainfall area is quite wide. This is an extremely favorable condition for our sowing work. Leading organs in various places must seize the opportunity, concentrate their efforts, and make a concentrated effort to sow.

The most central link is to organize manpower and animal power well, and to adjust livestock and farm implements, as quickly as possible, to take advantage of the wet conditions to sow. Cadres should go deep, widely organize the masses to rush to plant, and solve the difficulties of the masses. Some areas, due to drought prevention, have done a good job of organization. In these areas, now that it has rained, the original organization should be used to quickly switch to rushing to plant.

The quality of the year's agricultural production largely depends on the sowing work. We believe that leading organs in various places will seize the opportunity, ensure that this work is done well, and lay a solid foundation for the strategic task of "an inch of growth in production."

    喜雨降
    快播种
    最近喜讯频传，各地陆续落雨，冀鲁豫、冀东一部地区并已下透，昨夜北平附近又降喜雨，据估计，落雨地区相当宽广，这对我们的播种工作是一极其有利的条件，各地领导机关须抓紧时机，集中力量突击播种。
    最中心的一环是很好地组织人畜力，并调剂牲畜农具，尽快的赶湿下种。干部要深入下去，广泛组织群众抢种，解决群众的困难，若干地区由于进行防旱，曾作了很好的组织工作，在这些地区，既经落雨，则应利用原有组织，迅速转上抢种工作。
    全年农业生产的好坏，很大一部分决定于播种工作。相信各地领导机关能够抓紧时机，保证把这一工作做好，给“生产长一寸”的战略任务打下可靠基础。
