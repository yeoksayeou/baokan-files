    Beijing Tongrentang Pharmacy
    Labor-Capital Agreement Adjusts Wages
    Boosting Employee Enthusiasm
    [Special report by our newspaper] Since adjusting wages, Beijing Tongrentang Pharmacy, with the joint efforts of labor and capital to develop production and business, has achieved remarkable results in just over a month. Tongrentang Pharmacy is one of the larger pharmacies in Beiping, with 202 employees. After the liberation of Beiping, the pharmacy's union was established on February 5th. The first task was to demand the reform of the pharmacy's long-standing malpractices and to reasonably adjust wages to fully unleash the enthusiasm of all employees. On February 6th, the union, representing all employees, presented eight specific suggestions to the management, which can be summarized as follows: First, abolish all feudal shop rules. Second, all of the management's various pretexts and empty positions used to extract funds from the employees' total wage commission must be eliminated. Third, the management's salary points (in the past, many received the most money without doing anything), as well as all private employment expenses and so-called charitable expenses, must not be used from the employees' total wage commission. Fourth, the total wage commission for employees was too low (previously 26.7%), and should be adjusted. Fifth, the lowest and highest number of employee points, as well as the commission for sales staff, pocket money increases, etc., should all be revised. The Beijing branch and the Nanjing branch of the pharmacy should calculate wages separately (because there is no remittance with Nanjing, it is impossible to calculate accounts). The management accepted some of these suggestions at the time, and the rest were allowed to be resolved through negotiation. The focus of the dispute between the two sides was the total wage commission. The labor's opinion was that it should be 36%, while the management's opinion was to maintain the original amount or slightly increase it. After many consultations, the labor and capital officially signed an agreement in mid-March under the guidance of the work team. The total wage commission for employees was determined to be 32% (including pocket money, etc.). The sales staff's treatment was 3.2% of the total commission. The highest employee wage was 5.6 points, the lowest was 1 point, pocket money was averaged, and all other unreasonable expenses of the management were cancelled. Since the establishment of this agreement, the enthusiasm of employees in production and business has greatly increased. For example, workers making pills in the pharmaceutical factory used to make 100 pills per day, but now they have increased to 300 pills, because the workers voluntarily increased their working hours. Significant gains have also been made in terms of savings. Waste of water and electricity has been avoided. According to statistics, food expenses can be saved by 20 to 30 catties of rice and flour per day. More than 100 or 200 catties of coal are also saved every day. In just a few things such as repairing large cabinets, ditches, and doors, employees found waste materials to utilize, saving about 100,000 yuan in material costs. The pharmacy has not conducted inventory (i.e., cleaning up) for many years. Recently, all employees assisted the management in conducting a major reorganization of all goods and supplies in the pharmacy, numbering them separately, and arranging the warehouse order in an orderly manner. Seeing that all employees were so frugal and worked hard in production, the management was also moved, and took the initiative to find a place for the union to arrange office space, increase food costs, improve meals, and donate some items and musical instruments to help employees' cultural and recreational activities. Currently, the pharmacy's business has gradually increased from a daily income of 200,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan after liberation to the current 500,000 yuan. The total business volume of the pharmacy in March was 7,411,228 yuan, and it increased to 10,010,3972 yuan in April. According to the commission in April, the lowest amount that employees can receive is 9,165 yuan, and the highest amount is 39,824 yuan (including pocket money). In March, the management obtained a net profit of more than 700,000 yuan. Because the pharmacy made some improvements to the lives of employees, it greatly stimulated the improvement of production and business enthusiasm, so that both labor and capital benefit and improve day by day.

    劳资协议调整工资
    职工生产积极性提高
    【本报专访】平市同仁堂药店，自调整工资后，劳资双方协力发展生产，经营业务，一个多月以来，已获显著成绩。同仁堂药店为北平较大药店之一，有职工二百零二人。平市解放后，该店职工会于二月五日即告成立。第一件工作，即要求改革该店积弊，合理调整工资，以充分发挥全体职工的积极性。二月六日，职工会即代表全体职工，向资方提出八项具体意见，概括可分为如下几条：第一，取销一切封建铺规。第二，资方的一切巧立名目，空名顶替从职工的工资总提成中开支现象，必须消灭。第三，资方薪给分数（过去多不问事而拿钱最多），以及一切私人用人的开支，并所谓慈善事业的开支，均不得在职工工资总提成中动用。第四，职工工资的总提成过低（过去为百分之二十六点七），应当调整。第五，如职工分数的最低数与最高数以及售货员待遇的提成，零用钱加上加下等均应改订，该店北平号与南京分号应分开计算工资（因与南京不通汇，无法算帐）。资方对这些意见，当时除接受了一部分外，其余允许商量解决，双方的争执中心在工资的总提成，劳方的意见应为百分之三十六，资方的意见为仍保持原数，或稍有增加，经过多次协商，劳资双方在工作组的指导下于三月中旬正式签字，达成协议。职工工资的总提成确定为百分之三十二（零用钱等均包括在内），售货员的待遇，是总提成中的百分之三点二。职工工资最高的为五分六，最低为一分，零用钱取平，其余一切资方不合理开支等均取消。自这一协议成立后，职工生产、营业积极性大为提高，如制药厂作丸药的工人，有种丸药过去每天做一百丸，现提高到三百丸，因为工人主动地增加了工时。节约方面亦收获很大，用水用电均避免了浪费。据统计，伙食方面每日可节省用米用面二十斤至三十斤不等。每日节省用煤也有一百多斤或者是二百斤。只在修理大柜、地沟、门等几项事情中，职工找出废料来利用，即节约了料钱约值十万元。该店已多少年来未进行盘货（即清理），最近全体职工协助资方将该店一切货物用品进行了一次大整顿，分别编号，库房秩序安排得有条不紊。资方见到全体职工如此节约努力生产，亦有所感动，并主动找房子给职工会安排办公的地方，提高菜金，改善伙食，并捐了一部物品、乐器帮助职工文化娱乐活动。现该店营业，自解放后已由每日收入二十万元、三十万元，逐渐达到现在的五十万元。该店三月份的营业总额为七百四十一万一千二百二十八元，四月份即提高到一千零十万零三千九百七十二元。依四月份的提成来计算，职工最低的可分到九千一百六十五元，高的可分到三万九千八百二十四元（以上零用钱包括在内）。三月份资方即获纯益七十余万元。由于该店对职工生活的某些改善，而大大刺激了生产、营业情绪的提高，因之劳资两有利并日有提高。
