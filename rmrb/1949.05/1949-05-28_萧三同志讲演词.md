[This City News] The following is the original text of the speech by Comrade Xiao San, a representative of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress who returned victoriously, at the welcoming rally in Beiping:

　　The World Peace Congress, held simultaneously in Paris and Prague from April 20th to 25th this year, was a major international event. To estimate the significance of this event, one only needs to look at the anger and fear of the imperialist camp towards the congress.

　　How many measures did the reactionary ruling classes of various capitalist countries, first and foremost the governments of the United States and Britain, take to obstruct the Peace Congress and attempt to isolate its influence! They used many police and propaganda methods—from the most brutal provocations to the most sophisticated methods of undermining public opinion—to obstruct the progress of the Peace Congress: (1) Restricting the issuance of visas to representatives from various countries attending the Peace Congress to enter France; (2) The Non-American Activities Committee threatened American representatives going to the congress with the name of "foreign spies"; (3) Some fascists and American secret agents were convened in Paris, wanting to prepare a fake peace conference and sing a "double act."

　　But all of this was in vain, and the World Peace Congress opened simultaneously in Paris and Prague. The congress was held in two locations, which only increased its power. Representatives of 800 million people spoke brave and just words at the congress—oppose the instigators of war, defend peace! Then the new war instigators wanted to deal with the congress with silence. The so-called free press seemed to think that nothing had happened in Paris or Prague. But this was also ineffective. The speeches of the congress representatives resounded throughout the world, penetrated into every corner of every country, without any passports or entry visas!

　　Concealment and cover-up were not working, silence was not working, so the imperialists fabricated rumors. Through their newspapers and broadcasts, they said that the World Peace Congress was a "communist conspiracy." This is the most vicious and also the most futile attempt! Naturally, communists in any country do not deny that the Communist Party is the most thorough defender of peace, and that imperialism and capitalism are the root causes of war. But slander and defamation can never reduce the significance of the congress and limit its influence.

　　All the representatives who attended, included people with various political and religious beliefs. They found a common language, which is to demand peace and oppose the imperialist instigators of a new world war. This is the same feeling, the same reason, heart to heart, so the congress was victorious.

　　The great significance of the World Peace Congress lies in the fact that it took the first step in organizing peace-keeping work. There is no doubt that everyone wants peace, but how to guarantee its realization is the crux of the matter. The congress found a way, which is to establish organizations to ensure peace throughout the world, and to undertake the task of organizing more and more peace-keeping forces. To this end, the Peace Congress has decided to establish a permanent committee to unite the peace forces of the world. This committee will continue the work started by the Paris and Prague conferences. The general program of action of the committee is: resolutely oppose all manifestations of aggression, oppose the propaganda of instigating war, oppose attempts to launch a third world war; use all forces to guarantee peace. The committee will undertake the work of contact and exchange of information and experience between all people's national and local peace organizations, as well as all individuals working for peace. The committee will also unite the forces of peace advocates to oppose aggressors and help the victims of aggression and oppression. Upholding peace is inseparable from opposing national oppression and advocating national independence and freedom.

　　In order to support all collective and individual work in the cultural field for peace, the conference decided to hold a world prize every year to reward films, literature and art works that help consolidate peace among people.

　　The World Peace Advocates Conference is an important step in defending world peace. After this conference, the forces in favor of peace around the world will become more active and more united. This year's "May Day" demonstrations in various countries, and the continuous great victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, demonstrate the determination to defend peace and also the strength to defend peace. In order to guarantee the peace of China, the Far East and even the world, we must plant Chairman Mao's banner in Taiwan, Hainan Island, Kunming, Dihua, and throughout China!

　　Therefore, we--

　　Thank the broad masses of the Chinese working people!

　　Thank the People's Liberation Army!

　　Thank the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Thank Chairman Mao!

　　Thank the world peace fortress--the Soviet Union!

　　Thank Marshal Stalin!

　　萧三同志讲演词
    【本市讯】出席世界拥护和平大会胜利归国的中国代表团萧三代表在北平欢迎大会上的讲演原词如下：
    今年四月二十日至二十五日在巴黎和布拉格同时举行的全世界拥护和平大会，是一件巨大的国际事件。要估计这个事件的意义，只要看看帝国主义的营垒对大会的愤恨和恐惧就知道了。
    各资本主义国家反动统治阶级的政权，首先是美、英两国政府，采取了多少办法来阻碍和平大会，和企图孤立大会的影响啊！他们用了多少警察的、宣传的办法--从最粗暴的挑拨到最精细的破坏社会舆论的方法来阻碍和平大会的进行：（一）限制发给各国出席和平大会的代表进入法国的签证；（二）非美行动委员会用“外国间谍”的名义威胁去参加大会的美国代表；（三）在巴黎召集一些法西斯蒂和美国特务分子，想准备开一个假和平大会，唱“双包案”。
    但所有这一切都是枉然，世界拥护和平大会在巴黎和布拉格同时开幕了。大会分为两地进行，只是增加了它的威力。八万万人的代表们，在大会上说出了勇敢的、公正的话--反对战争挑拨者，保卫和平！于是新战争挑拨者们想以沉默来对付大会，所谓新闻自由的报刊，都仿佛认为在巴黎，在布拉格没有发生什么事情。但是，这也无效，大会代表的发言，响遍了全世界，深入到各个国家的各个角落，也不要什么护照，什么入境签证！
    隐蔽、掩盖不行，沉默不行，帝国主义者于是造谣，通过他们的报纸、广播，说世界拥护和平大会是“共产党的阴谋。”这是最恶毒也是最没有出息的企图！自然，无论那一国的共产党员，都不否认共产党是最彻底的和平保卫者，而帝国主义、资本主义是产生战争的根源。但造谣中伤，决不可能减少大会的意义和限制他的影响。
    所有到会的代表，包括了各种政治信仰、宗教信仰不同的人。他们找到了一种共同的语句，那就是要求和平，反对新的世界大战的帝国主义挑拨者。这是人同此心，心同此理，心心相印，所以大会胜利了。
    世界拥护和平大会的巨大意义在于它作了组织保卫和平工作的第一步，没有疑问，所有的人都要和平，但如何保证实现它，这是症结所在。大会找到一条道路，即在全世界建立起保证和平的组织，并担负起组织更多更多的保卫和平力量的任务。为此，和平大会已决定成立永久委员会，以联合全世界的和平力量。这个委员会将继续巴黎和布拉格大会所开始的事业。委员会的行动总纲领是：坚决反对侵略的一切表现，反对挑拨战争的宣传，反对发动第三次世界大战的企图；用一切力量来保证和平。委员会将在一切人民国家、地方的和平组织之间，以及一切为和平工作的个人之间，担负起联系和交换消息、交换经验的工作。委员会亦将团结和平拥护者的力量以反对侵略者，帮助被侵略和被压迫的牺牲者。拥护和平与反对民族压迫，主张民族独立、自由是分不开的。
    为了支持一切集体的和个人的，在为和平的文化领域内的工作，大会决定每年举行一次世界奖金，奖励有助于巩固人民间和平的电影、文学和艺术的作品。
    全世界和平拥护者大会是保卫世界和平的重要步骤。经过这次大会，全世界赞成和平的力量将会更加积极，更加团结起来。今年“五一”在各国的大示威，和中国人民解放军的连续不断的伟大胜利，就表现了保卫和平的决心、也表现了保卫和平的力量。为了保障中国的、远东的乃至世界的和平，我们要把毛主席的旗帜插到台湾、海南岛、昆明、迪化，插到全中国去！
    因此我们--
    感谢中国广大的劳动人民！
    感谢人民解放军！
    感谢中国共产党！
    感谢毛主席！
    感谢世界和平堡垒--苏联！
    感谢斯大林大元帅！
