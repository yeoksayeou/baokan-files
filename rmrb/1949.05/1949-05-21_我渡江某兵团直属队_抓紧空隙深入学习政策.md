Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 20th—The unit directly under a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army has been intensively studying policies during breaks after crossing the river. Since the 11th, the unit has extracted one-third of its office cadres and one-half of its company cadres, concentrating them at the corps headquarters, forming two cadre study detachments, one for those at the battalion level and above, and one for those below the company level, for study, with the study time set for two weeks. Xie Fuzhi, political commissar of the corps, criticized the idea held by some that policies were irrelevant to them, making them unwilling to study and eager to depart for work, at the mobilization meeting for the direct unit's study session, calling on everyone to study with peace of mind and to prevent the emergence of pride and pleasure-seeking thoughts.

　　我渡江某兵团直属队
  　抓紧空隙深入学习政策
    【新华社浙赣前线二十日电】人民解放军某兵团直属队于渡江后抓紧空隙时间深入学习政策。自十一日开始，该部抽调了三分之一的机关干部及二分之一的连队干部，集中兵团部，组成营以上的和连以下的两个干部学习大队，进行学习，学习时间定为两星期。兵团政委谢富治在直属队学习动员会上，批判了某些认为政策与自己无关，不愿学习而急于要求出发工作的思想，号召大家安心学习，并防止骄傲与享乐思想的发生。
