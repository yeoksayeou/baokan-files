    Q&A on the Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region
    First Part: Regarding the Tax Regulations
    Q: Why not use a unified progressive tax system, but instead implement the new agricultural tax regulations?
    A: Before the land reform, land was mostly in the hands of landlords and rich peasants, and most farmers were oppressed and exploited, living in hardship. At that time, in order to balance the burden, weaken feudalism, encourage production, and ensure war supplies, a unified progressive tax system was adopted. This method was supported by the vast majority of farmers. After the land reform, the feudal and semi-feudal land exploitation system was completely eliminated, and farmers obtained roughly equal land. In order to restore and develop agricultural production, enable everyone to become prosperous, and smoothly carry out the new democratic economic construction, a proportional tax system with tax exemption points will be implemented in the future.
    Q: What is a "single tax system with proportional levy"?
    A: It means that the normal annual yield of land is calculated based on one shi of grain per municipal unit as a standard mu. The tax-exempt point per capita and livestock consumption are deducted within the standard mu. The remaining portion is called the burden mu, and each burden mu is levied at a rate of 25 jin of rice. Each mu is calculated as one mu, without progression. This is called "proportional levy." Farmers only pay this one type of tax in a year, which is called a "single tax."
    Q: What are the benefits of the new tax regulations?
    A: First, the burden is fixed according to the assessed yield. For improved planting, planting special crops, applying more fertilizer, and intensive farming, the portion exceeding the assessed yield will not increase the burden. For those who are lazy and do not farm well, the burden will not be reduced even if the yield is lower than the assessed yield, in order to encourage everyone to farm well. Second, the assessed yield will be made accurate and fair to balance the burden, ensure the supply for the People's Liberation War, and strive for the early arrival of victory. Third, it is fair and reasonable, easy to understand and calculate, so that everyone can know the base and know how much the burden will be for the year.
    Q: Who should pay the agricultural tax? Who should bear the burden for mortgaged land and rented land?
    A: Whoever owns the land bears the burden. Whoever mortgages the land bears the burden. Whoever receives the rent bears the burden. For sharecropping, the burden can be calculated based on the amount of grain shared by both parties.
    Q: Which lands are not subject to the burden?
    A: House yards, foundations, threshing grounds, highways, canals, riverbeds, river embankments, general woodlands (those with crops planted inside should still be assessed according to their actual income), barren land (not abandoned due to laziness), state-owned farms, forest farms, nurseries for experimental promotion purposes, and other lands that cannot be cultivated.
    Q: Which lands are not subject to the burden for a certain period of time?
    A: 1. Newly cultivated wasteland and reclaimed mature wasteland for more than six years, or newly built mountain land, terraced fields, and river beach land, are not subject to the burden within three years. 2. Mature wasteland cultivated for three to five years is not subject to the burden within two years. 3. Rotating land is not subject to the burden in years when it is not cultivated.
    Second Part: Regarding the Unit of Calculation for Cultivated Land - Standard Mu
    Q: What is a "standard mu"?
    A: A "standard mu" is the unit of calculation for cultivated land in the new tax regulations. It is calculated by converting the normal annual yield of the main grain crops of the land into grain. Land with a normal annual yield of one shi of grain is one standard mu, one dou is one fen of a standard mu, and one sheng is one li of a standard mu.
    Q: What is "normal annual yield"?
    A: "Normal annual yield" refers to the yield that land should harvest when planting the main grain crops according to local customs and in normal years.
    Q: What are "special crops" and why should the standard mu be calculated according to the normal annual yield of similar land?
    A: "Special crops" are sometimes called "economic crops," such as indigo, hemp, peanuts, cotton, and tobacco leaves. Because these things can be used as industrial raw materials. Only by encouraging more planting can our industry develop and can we buy cheap things.
    Q: What should be done if land improves, the grade increases, and the yield increases?
    A: 1. For those who dig canals and wells to turn dry land into paddy fields, the standard mu will not be revised within three years. From the fourth year, the standard mu will be revised according to the normal annual yield after the grade has been raised. If the increased harvest volume within three years cannot compensate for the land improvement costs, an application can be submitted to the county government to extend the period for revising the standard mu. 2. For those who repair abandoned canals and wells to restore old paddy fields, the standard mu will not be revised within two years. From the third year, the standard mu will be revised according to the normal annual yield after the paddy fields have been restored.
    Q: What are fruit trees?
    A: Pears, peaches, apricots, fruits, grapes, plums, plums, cherries, etc. are called fruit trees.
    Q: What are mountain products?
    A: Chestnuts, persimmons, walnuts, dates, pepper, medicinal materials, etc. are called mountain products.
    Q: How to calculate the standard mu for orchards, mulberry gardens, bamboo gardens, mountain products, and lotus ponds?
    A: Calculate the standard mu by converting the average yield of these things over several years of bearing fruit, resting, good harvest, and poor harvest, and 50% of the average wholesale price in the selling season, into grain.

    华北区农业税暂行税则问答
    第一部分：关于税则
    问：为什么不用统一累进税则，而要实行新农业税则？
    答：土地改革以前，土地多半在地主富农手里，大部分农民受他们的压迫剥削，生活困难，当时为了平衡负担、削弱封建、奖励生产、保证战争供给，所以负担政策采用统一累进税制；这办法受到广大农民的拥护。土地改革以后，封建半封建土地剥削制度彻底消灭，农民得到了大体平均的土地，为了恢复与发展农业生产，使大家都能发家致富，顺利开展新民主主义的经济建设，所以今后要实行有免税点的比例征收的新农业税则。
    问：什么是“比例征收的单一税制”？
    答：就是把土地常年应产量，按每一市石谷算作一个标准亩，在标准亩内扣去人口免税点和牲口消耗，剩下的就叫负担亩，每负担亩规定征米二十五斤，有一亩算一亩，不累进，就叫“比例征收”；农民种地一年，只交纳这一种税，就叫“单一税”。
    问：新税则有些什么好处？
    答：第一，按评定产量固定负担，对改良种植，种植特种作物，多施肥，精耕细作，超过评产部分，不增加负担；对懒惰不好好种地，不够评定产量的也不减少负担，以奖励大家好好生产。第二，把产量评的真实公道，使负担平衡，保证人民解放战争的供给，争取胜利早日到来。第三，公平合理，明白好算，大家能摸住底子，知道一年负担多少。
    问：向谁征收农业税？典当地、租佃地该谁负担？
    答：谁的土地谁负担，谁典当下土地谁负担，谁得租子谁负担，伴种地可按双方所分粮食多少来计算负担。
    问：那些土地不负担？
    答：房院地基、场面地、公路、水渠、河身、河堤占地、一般林木地（里面种庄稼的，仍应按其实际收入评议负担）、荒地（不是怠于耕作而荒芜者）、公营农场、林场和以试验推广为目的之苗圃等，及其他不能耕种之土地。
    问：什么土地在一定的年限不负担？
    答：一，垦种生荒和满六年以上的熟荒、或新修山地、梯田、河滩地，三年以内不负担。二，垦种三年至五年的熟荒地，二年以内不负担。三，轮种地，不耕作之年不负担。
    第二部分：关于耕地计算单位——标准亩
    问：什么叫“标准亩”？
    答：“标准亩”是新税则的耕地计算单位，它是以土地的主要粮谷作物的常年应产量折谷计算的；凡常年应产谷一市石的土地，为一标准亩，一斗为标准亩一分，一升为标准亩一厘。
    问：什么叫“常年应产量”？
    答：“常年应产量”就是土地依当地习惯，种植主要之粮谷作物，按通常年成，所应收获的产量。
    问：什么叫“特种作物”，为什么要按相同土地之常年应产量计算标准亩？
    答：“特种作物”有的地方叫“经济作物”，如靛、大麻、花生、棉花、烟叶等。因为这些东西都能做工业原料。只有奖励多多种植，我们的工业才能发展起来，我们才能买到便宜的东西。
    问：土地因改良而提高地等，增加产量该怎么办？
    答：一、开渠凿井、变旱田为水田的，三年以内不改订标准亩，自第四年起，依提高地等后之常年应产量改订标准亩，如三年以内所增收获量，不能补偿所用去的土地改良费时，可呈请县政府延长改订标准亩的年限。二、修理废渠废井，恢复旧有水田，二年以内不改订标准亩，自第三年起，依恢复水田后的常年应产量改订标准亩。
    问：什么叫果木？
    答：梨、桃、杏、果、葡萄、李、梅、樱桃等叫果木。
    问：什么叫山货？
    答：栗子、柿子、核桃、枣儿、胡椒、药材等叫山货。
    问：果木园、桑园、竹园、山货及藕池等地怎样计算标准亩？
    答：按这些东西挂枝、歇枝、丰收、歉收几年的平均产量与出卖季节的平均批发价格五成，折谷计算标准亩。
