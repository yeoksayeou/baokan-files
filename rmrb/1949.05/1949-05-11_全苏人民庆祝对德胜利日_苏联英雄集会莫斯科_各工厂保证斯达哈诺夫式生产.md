Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 10th: Moscow Dispatch: The people of the Soviet Union are enthusiastically celebrating the fourth anniversary of the great victory over Hitler's Germany on May 9th. On May 8th, mass rallies celebrating Victory Day were held in Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Kiev, Minsk, and other cities. In Moscow, the people gathered with Soviet heroes and participants in the Great Patriotic War in the Central Culture and Recreation Park. Kiev held an exhibition of "Ukrainian Partisans in the Struggle Against Fascist Aggressors." Many people paid respects at the tomb of General Vatutin, the liberator of Kiev, and the tomb of Lieutenant Rudenko, who first drove a tank into Kiev. To celebrate Victory Day, veterans of the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Moscow put forward Stakhanovite guarantees to produce 17 tons of high-grade steel per square meter of furnace surface, exceeding the original plan of 8.62 tons. Baku oil well workers and Stalingrad warrior Kulikov completed the drilling of new oil wells fifteen days ahead of schedule. Mamidov and Dukhonin, veterans who fought from the foothills of the Caucasus to Berlin and received many medals for their outstanding military achievements, have now been awarded the Order of Lenin for their labor achievements. The entire staff of the Kavelnikas factory, which produces electric motors, put forward Stakhanovite guarantees in commemoration of Victory Day. More than fifty veterans in the factory have already completed their plans for this year ahead of schedule. Krylanskas, a former frontline gunner and now an assembly worker in the Xutobu, completed five times his quota in one shift. Since the beginning of the post-war Five-Year Plan, he has produced eight years' worth of quotas.
