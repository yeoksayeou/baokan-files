Under the victorious impact of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the reactionaries of Southeast Asian countries and their masters, the US imperialists, are in dire straits. US imperialist representative Cochran participated in the negotiations between the Netherlands and the Hatta traitors. At a time when the people's forces are becoming increasingly strong, he enabled the negotiating parties to reach the "Batavia Agreement," vainly attempting to divide and suppress the Indonesian national liberation movement. Cochran himself did not hide his embarrassment: "In view of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, it is necessary to resolve the Indonesian issue as quickly as possible." Seeing that Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and other places are gradually becoming entirely owned by the people, the US imperialists still dream of making the "security" of Indonesia more suitable for their needs of aggression! But the US imperialists' wishful thinking has failed. The "security" of Indonesia will not be as the US imperialists dream. Hatta can betray the country, but the Indonesian people will never agree!

　　印尼人民决不会答应！
    在我国人民解放战争的胜利冲击下，东南亚洲各国的反动派及他们的主子——美帝国主义，大为狼狈了，美帝代表柯契伦参加了荷兰与哈达卖国贼的谈判，在人民力量益趋强大的时候，使谈判双方获致了“巴达维亚协议”，妄图分化镇压印尼民族解放运动，柯契伦本人倒毫不隐瞒他的窘态：“鉴于中国人民解放战争的胜利，有必要仅快地解决印尼问题”。美帝看到越南，缅甸，马来亚等地正日渐全部地归于人民所有，还梦想把印尼的“治安”搞得更合适他的侵略需要！但是美帝的如意算盘不灵了，印尼的“治安”不会象美帝所梦想的一样，哈达可以卖国，但印尼人民决不会答应！
