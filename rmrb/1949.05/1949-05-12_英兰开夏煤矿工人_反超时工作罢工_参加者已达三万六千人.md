Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 11th—Reports from various sources state that the strike by coal miners in Lancashire, England, had reached 36,000 participants by the 9th and is continuing to expand. The strike began at the beginning of this month, with only 260 participants at that time. The strikers are protesting against overtime work in the mines and against the National Coal Board's refusal to provide free coal for miners' families. More than half of the miners in Lancashire are participating in the strike, and more than fifty mines have ceased operations.
