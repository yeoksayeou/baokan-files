    I. Socialist Youth League and Communist Youth League

    After the May Fourth Movement, several young people in Shanghai who believed in Marxism, including Yun Daiying, Xiao Chunu, and Zhang Tailei, initiated the establishment of the Chinese Socialist Youth League in August 1920. In May 1922, the Provisional Central Bureau of the League held its first National Congress in Shanghai, adopted a program, and decided to join the Young Communist International. At that time, it published the organ "Chinese Youth," edited by Yun Daiying. The Chinese Socialist Youth League played a role in preparing ideologically and organizationally for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. In May 1925, the Chinese Socialist Youth League officially changed its name to the Chinese Communist Youth League at its second Congress. By the time of the fourth Congress in June 1927, the membership had grown to over 5,000. The Youth League actively participated in the May 30th Movement and the Northern Expedition, and in 1927, it was the first to oppose Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism. During the land revolution after the failure of the Great Revolution, the Youth League played an active pioneering role in mobilizing young people to join the Red Army, distributing land and conducting land surveys, and organizing children. At that time, the League's organ was called "Youth Truth." During the brutal civil war, the Youth League was a heroic supporting force. The famous Young Communist International Division was entirely organized by League members. However, in the later period of the land revolution, due to "leftist" deviations in leadership, the Youth League's work style also developed serious tendencies towards closed-doorism, resulting in insufficient mass character in the League's organization. In November 1935, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on youth work, deciding to transform the organization and working methods of the Youth League, so that the League would become a broad mass-based non-Party youth organization striving for national liberation. As a result of the transformation of the Communist Youth League, the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard and later the Youth National Salvation Corps in Wuhan, Xuzhou and other places, and the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard were formed in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the enemy-occupied base areas, organizations such as the Youth National Salvation Association and the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard were established.

    II. Chinese National Liberation Vanguard

    The December 9th Patriotic Movement of 1935 was the prelude to the War of Resistance. During the December 9th Movement, students in Beijing and Tianjin went to the countryside to publicize to the peasants and raised their own awareness. In the spring of 1936, based on the southward propaganda group and combining with the original underground revolutionary small groups such as the National Armed Self-Defense Association, the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard, referred to as the "Minxian," was formed as an organization of advanced youth. After its establishment, the Minxian quickly developed in all directions, with organizations in Tianjin, Wuhan, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Guangdong, and even Paris and London. In the winter of 1936, the National Congress of the Minxian was held, and the General Headquarters of the National Minxian was officially established. By the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it had grown to more than 20,000 members. A large number of Minxian members went to the front lines of the War of Resistance and participated in the struggle in various enemy-occupied base areas. The Minxian in the Kuomintang areas were subjected to frantic persecution and were finally forced to disband in 1938.

    III. Youth National Salvation Corps, Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard

    In November 1937, Wuhan youth who had participated in the December 9th Movement established the Youth National Salvation Corps, which quickly developed to Yichang, Shashi, and the Henan and Jiangxi areas. The main components were students and some workers. Wuhan alone had more than 5,000 members. The Fifth War Zone Youth National Salvation Corps centered on Xuzhou also had nearly 10,000 members. After the fall of Wuhan, a large number of members of the Wuhan Youth National Salvation Corps went to the Dabie Mountains to fight guerrilla warfare and participate in the work of opening up the Central Plains Liberated Area. Many members of the Youth National Salvation Corps in the Xuzhou area also participated in the armed struggle in the Lunan area. In Guangdong, the youth organizations in the December 9th Movement combined to form the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, which later developed throughout the province. After the fall of Guangzhou, the Anti-Japanese Vanguard called on people to go to the countryside and organize armed forces. Many members of the East River Column were members of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard.

    IV. Youth National Salvation Association, Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard

    After the transformation of the Communist Youth League, the Northwest Youth National Salvation Federation was established in Yan'an. In the autumn of 1938, the Northwest Youth National Salvation Association held the Northwest Youth Congress in Yan'an, and youth organizations from all over the country sent representatives to participate. In 1937, the Northwest Youth National Salvation Association established the Anwu Fort Wartime Youth Training Class in northern Shaanxi, recruiting a large number of anti-Japanese youth, providing them with short-term training, and assigning them to work in various parts of the Liberated Areas. This played a great role in carrying out work in various places. Subsequently, youth national salvation associations were established in various liberated areas. The Youth National Salvation Association was a broad organization including all anti-Japanese youth masses, mainly participating in work such as joining the army, production, supporting the front lines, rent reduction, and literacy classes in rural areas. By 1940, there were more than one million members in the liberated areas.

    After 1940, the Youth National Salvation Associations in the Jin-Cha-Ji, Shandong, and Jin-Sui liberated areas established the backbone youth armed organization - the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard - to cooperate with the army in armed struggle against the Japanese invaders.

    The Youth National Salvation Association had great achievements, but in the middle of the War of Resistance, some local Youth National Salvation Associations overemphasized the special interests of young people, such as establishing youth farms independently in rural areas where the family was the production unit, which led to a detachment from the interests of the entire people, forming a tendency of youthism and vanguardism, but this bias was soon corrected. The organization of the Youth National Salvation Association itself also had shortcomings. It was a broad mass organization, lacking the organized promotion of advanced youth, and therefore could not meet the needs of advanced youth in the later period of the War of Resistance, and the Youth National Salvation Association itself became lax and weak. In 1946, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the establishment of an organization of youth activists, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and issued a resolution on the establishment of the Youth League on New Year's Day in 1949.

    Representatives of youth organizations from all over the country who participated in the Northwest Youth Congress in the autumn of 1938 jointly decided to establish the Joint Office of the China Youth National Salvation Organizations, which became an organization leading youth work throughout the country. The organ at that time was "China Youth." In the autumn of 1945, responsible cadres of the Youth National Salvation Associations in various places gathered in Yan'an and believed that it was necessary to establish a unified leadership organization for youth in the Liberated Areas. Therefore, a preparatory committee for the Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas was elected, and the Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas was established in the summer of 1947.

    V. Democratic Youth League and Democratic Youth Alliance

    In the later period of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1945, an underground organization of advanced youth with New Democracy as its political program was established in the Kuomintang-controlled areas - the Democratic Youth League, referred to as the Minqing. The members were mainly students and some professional youth. After the May 20th Movement in 1947, several advanced youth organizations were also established in Beijing and Tianjin schools, such as the Democratic Youth Alliance, referred to as the Minlian.

    In the continuous struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, such as the December 1st, December 30th, May 20th, and the April and June movements of 1948, the Minqing and Minlian played a core role, uniting all students to fight together and cooperating with the development of the People's Liberation War. At the time of the liberation of Beiping, there were about 4,500 members of the Minqing and Minlian in Beiping. After liberation, most of them went public and joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    VI. Northeast Democratic Youth League

    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in August 1946, the mass progressive youth organization - the Northeast Democratic Youth League - was established in Harbin, and later developed to Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Bei'an, Hailar and other cities in northern Manchuria. The Democratic Youth League played an active backbone role in the ideological transformation movement of students in Northeast China, in uniting progressive students to participate in land reform and various social services. On May 4, 1946, the Harbin Democratic Youth League formally established the Harbin Youth League on the original basis, and most of the members joined the Youth League. At that time, there were a total of 3,500 members.

    VII. Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Youth League

    Shortly after Japan's surrender, advanced youth in Inner Mongolia organized the Inner Mongolia Youth League, which was later renamed the People's Revolutionary Youth League, accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This organization developed from advanced intellectuals to laboring youth in factories, troops, rural areas, and grasslands, and now has more than 12,000 members. Many Communist Party members have been cultivated from these members. This organization has waged heroic and resolute struggles against reactionaries in Inner Mongolia. Recently, on March 25th, the People's Revolutionary Youth League held a representative congress and decided to change its name to the Inner Mongolia New Democratic Youth League.

    五四以来中国主要的革命青年团体介绍
    一、社会主义青年团和共产主义青年团
    “五四”运动以后，在上海有几位信仰马克思主义的青年恽代英、萧楚女、张太雷等于一九二○年八月发起组织中国社会主义青年团。一九二二年五月，团的临时中央局在上海召开第一次全国代表大会，通过纲领，并决定加入少共国际。当时出有机关刊物“中国青年”，由恽代英主编。中国社会主义青年团对建立中国共产党的工作，在某种意义上是起了思想上和组织上的准备作用的。一九二五年五月，中国社会主义青年团在第二次代表大会上，正式改名为中国共产主义青年团。到一九二七年六月第四次代表大会时，团员发展到五千余人。青年团积极地参加了“五卅”运动和北伐战争，并在一九二七年首先反对了陈独秀的右倾机会主义。大革命失败以后的土地革命时期，青年团在动员青年参加红军，分配土地和进行查田，组织少年儿童等工作中，都起了积极的先锋作用。当时团的机关刊物叫做“青年实话”。在残酷的内战中，青年团是一支英勇的支持力量。著名的少共国际师，全部是团员组织起来的。但在土地革命后期，由于领导上发生了“左”的偏向，青年团的工作作风也发生了严重的关门主义倾向，以致使青年团在组织上的群众性不够。一九三五年十一月，中共中央发布了关于青年工作的决定，决定改造青年团的组织及其工作方式，使团成为广大群众的、为民族解放而奋斗的非党的青年组织。共产主义青年团改造的结果，在国民党统治区产生了中华民族解放先锋队以及后来武汉、徐州等地的青年救国团和广东的青年抗日先锋队。在陕甘宁边区和敌后根据地产生了青年救国会，青年抗日先锋队等组织。
    二、中华民族解放先锋队
    一九三五年的“一二九”救亡运动是抗战的序幕。“一二九”运动中，平津学生到农村中去向农民宣传，并提高了自己的觉悟。一九三六年春，即以南下宣传团为基础，并结合了原有的民族武装自卫会等地下革命小团体，组成先进青年的组织——中华民族解放先锋队，简称民先队。民先队成立后，即迅速向各方面发展，平津、武汉、成都、郑州、广东以至巴黎、伦敦等地都有了民先队的组织。一九三六年冬天，召开民先队全国代表大会，正式成立了全国民先队总队部，到抗战爆发时，已发展到了两万余人。民先队员大批走上抗日战线，参加各敌后根据地的斗争。在国民党区的民先队则受到疯狂的迫害，终于在一九三八年被迫解散。
    三、青年救国团、广东青年抗日先锋队
    一九三七年十一月，曾经参加过“一二九”运动的武汉青年建立青年救国团，很快发展到宜昌、沙市及河南、江西一带，主要成份为学生及一部分工人，单武汉就有五千多人，以徐州为中心的第五战区青年救国团，亦有团员近万人。武汉失守后，武汉青年救国团的大批团员到大洪山打游击，参加开辟中原解放区的工作。徐州一带的青救团员也有很多参加了鲁南一带的武装斗争。在广东，“一二九”运动中的青年团体结合成立了广东青年抗日先锋队，后来发展到全省。抗先队在广州失陷后，号召下乡，组织武装，东江纵队中就有很多是抗先队员。
    四、青年救国会、青年抗日先锋队
    共产主义青年团改造后，在延安成立了西北青年救国联合会。西北青救会在一九三八年秋，在延安召开西北青年代表大会，全国各地青年团体均派有代表参加。一九三七年，西北青救会在陕北创办了安吴堡战时青年训练班，大批招收抗日青年，加以短期训练，分配到解放区各地工作。这对开展各地工作起了很大作用，随后在各解放区都成立了青年救国会。青年救国会是包括一切抗日青年群众的广泛的组织，主要是在农村中参加参军、生产、支援前线、减租、识字班等工作。至一九四○年时，各解放区的会员有百余万人。
    一九四○年以后，晋察冀、山东、晋东南等解放区的青救会成立了基干的青年武装组织——青年抗日先锋队，配合军队和日寇进行武装斗争。
    青救会是有极大成绩的，但在抗战中期，有些地方的青救会过分的强调青年的特殊利益，如在以家庭为生产单位的农村中，单独建立青年农场等，以致与整个人民的利益脱节，形成青年主义与先锋主义的偏向，但不久这种偏向即被纠正。青救会的组织本身也是有缺点的。它是广泛的群众性的组织，缺少先进青年有组织的推动，因而抗战后期就不能满足先进青年的需要，青年救国会本身也就松懈无力。至一九四六年，中共中央便提议建立青年积极分子的组织，成立中国新民主主义青年团，并在一九四九年元旦发出建立青年团的决议。
    参加一九三八年秋西北青年代表大会的全国各地青年团体的代表，共同决定成立中华青年救国团体联合办事处，成为领导全国青年工作的组织。当时的机关刊物是“中国青年”。一九四五年秋，各地青救会的负责干部在延安集会，认为有成立解放区青年统一领导机构的必要，于是选出了解放区青年联合会筹备委员会，在一九四七年夏，就成立了解放区青年联合会。
    五、民主青年同盟和民主青年联盟
    一九四五年抗战后期，在国民党统治区成立了一个以新民主主义为政治纲领的先进青年的地下组织——民主青年同盟，简称民青。盟员的成份主要是学生及一部份职业青年。一九四七年“五、二○”运动以后，在平津学校里也成立了几个先进青年组织，如民主青年联盟，简称民联。
    在连续的反对美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的斗争中，如“一二、一”“一二、卅”“五、二○”及一九四八年的四月和六月的运动中，民青和民联起了核心作用，团结全体同学一道斗争，配合了人民解放战争的发展。北平解放时，民青、民联在北平共约有四千五百余盟员，解放后，他们大部公开并转入了中国新民主主义青年团。
    六、东北民主青年同盟
    抗日战争胜利以后，在一九四六年八月，哈尔滨建立了群众性的进步青年的组织——东北民主青年联盟，以后并发展到齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江、北安、海拉尔等北满各城市，民主青年联盟在东北学生的思想改造运动中，在团结进步同学参加土地改革工作和各种社会务服中，都起了积极的骨干作用，一九四六年五月四日，哈尔滨的民主青年联盟即在原有基础上正式建立了哈市的青年团，绝大部分盟员均转入了青年团。当时共有盟员三千五百人。
    七、内蒙古人民革命青年团
    日本投降后不久，内蒙古的先进青年组织了内蒙古青年同盟，后又改名为人民革命青年团，接受中国共产党的领导。这个组织从先进的知识青年发展到工厂、部队、农村、草地等劳动青年，现在约有一万二千多团员。从这些盟员中已培养了很多共产党员。这个组织曾对内蒙古的反动分子作了英勇坚决的斗争。最近在三月二十五日人民革命青年团召开了代表大会，决定改为内蒙古的新民主主义青年团。
