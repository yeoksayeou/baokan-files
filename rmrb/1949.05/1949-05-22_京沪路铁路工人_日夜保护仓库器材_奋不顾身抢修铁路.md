Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: Railway workers in Suzhou, Zhenjiang and other places along the Jinghu Railway bravely protected railway warehouses and equipment, and repaired the railway. Before the People's Liberation Army arrived, workers in the Suzhou Railway Station's engineering section repair shop, locomotive depot and other departments organized a guard team to watch over the warehouse day and night. On April 25th, Kuomintang bandit troops came to the station to loot materials and set fire. Thanks to the brave firefighting efforts of the workers' guard team, the fire was contained. The next day, the bandit troops came to loot again, and the workers took advantage of their carelessness to take back one copy each of charts and files. Except for warehouses No. 1 and No. 2 in the Suzhou engineering section, the materials in warehouses No. 3 and No. 4 and twelve warehouses in the repair shop were intact due to the workers' brave protection. To prevent fleeing bandits from destroying the railway before escaping, twenty workers at the Lücheng station east of Suzhou hid all their tools. Employees of the Wangting section in Wuxi, under the leadership of supervisor Wang Yanggong, disregarded enemy plane strafing and spent nine days repairing the No. 120 and No. 113 iron bridges on both the east and west sides of the Xushuguan section, which had been destroyed by bandit troops, so that the railway between Nanjing and Suzhou could be opened to traffic as soon as possible. Wang Yanggong gloriously sacrificed his life after being shot by an enemy plane during the repair. Before the liberation of Wangting Station, Wang Yanggong, who had worked on the Jinghu Railway for twenty-five years, disregarded the danger of bandit troops destroying property everywhere and capturing laborers to guard railway equipment; when it was impossible to stay at the station, he hid the tools and the two telephones of the engineering section before taking cover; as soon as the enemy left, he immediately returned to lead the workers in repairing the iron bridge. Therefore, after Wang Yanggong gloriously died in the line of duty, all the workers unanimously expressed their determination to work hard to support the People's Liberation Army to avenge Wang Yanggong. The Wuxi Military Control Commission has sent people to take care of Wang Yanggong's funeral and to provide compensation to his family.

　　京沪路铁路工人
  　日夜保护仓库器材　奋不顾身抢修铁路
    【新华社南京二十一日电】苏州、镇江等地的京沪铁路工人英勇地保护铁路仓库、器材，抢修铁路。苏州火车站工务段修缮厂、机车所等部工人在人民解放军到来前，即组织纠察队，日夜看守仓库。四月二十五日国民党匪军到车站抢劫物资并放火焚烧，由于工人纠察队的英勇扑救，才遏止了火势。次日匪军又来抢劫，工人乘其不备夺回图表及档案各一部。苏州工务段除一、二号仓库外，三、四号仓库和修缮厂十二个仓库的资材均因工人英勇保护而完好无缺。苏州以东的吕城车站的二十个工人为防溃匪逃走前破坏铁路，把一切工具都藏了起来。无锡望亭段员工则在监工员王洋工的领导下，不顾敌机扫射，以九天时间抢修好被匪军破坏的浒墅关东西两面一二○、一一三两号铁桥，使南京苏州间铁路能早日通车。王洋工在抢修中被敌机射中光荣牺牲。在望亭车站解放前，在京沪路做了二十五年工的王洋工，即不顾匪军到处破坏和抓夫的危险看守铁路器材；当实在无法在站上停留时，又在藏好工具和工务段的两架电话机后才躲开去；敌人一走，他便马上回来领导工人抢修铁桥。因此王洋工光荣殉职后，全体工人一致表示要努力工作支援解放军来为王洋工报仇。无锡军管会已派人为王洋工料理后事，并抚恤其家属。
