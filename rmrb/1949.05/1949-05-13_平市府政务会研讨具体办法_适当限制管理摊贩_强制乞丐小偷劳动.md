    The Municipal Government of Beiping Holds a Political Affairs Meeting to Discuss Specific Measures:
    Appropriately Restricting and Managing Vendors
    Forcing Beggars and Thieves to Work
    [This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon (12th) at 2:00 PM, the People's Government of Beiping held a political affairs meeting in the West Flower Hall of the Municipal Government to discuss issues such as dealing with beggars and managing vendors. Everyone unanimously agreed that in order to stabilize social order and reduce the parasitic population, beggars, petty thieves, and pickpockets must be forced to engage in labor and production so that they can get on the right path. It was decided that the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Court, and the Health Bureau would organize an agency to manage beggars. Specific measures for dealing with beggars will be discussed in detail at another meeting convened by the Civil Affairs Bureau at 9:00 AM this morning (13th) with the other three units. Regarding the issue of managing vendors, in order to maintain traffic order and enable industry and commerce to develop normally, it is necessary to appropriately restrict and manage vendors. It was decided that the Construction Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Taxation Bureau, and the Land Administration Bureau would organize a vendor management committee to study and implement the drafted plan in detail.
