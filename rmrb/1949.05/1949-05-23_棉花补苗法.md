　　Cotton Replanting Method
    I. Methods to Remedy Missing Seedlings:
    When replanting, first irrigate the pit with water, and sow the seeds after the water has seeped in. The depth can be the same as usual, and the surrounding soil should be piled into a small mound on top. When the seedlings are about to emerge, flatten the mound. This will help retain moisture, but be careful not to flatten the mound too late. If replanting is already late, the best method is to transplant seedlings. Cotton is a deep-rooted crop, making transplanting difficult, but if done properly, it is easy to ensure survival. Experienced farmers have had great success with seedling transplantation. The method is described below: Before irrigation, make small pits where seedlings are missing. Then, using a shovel, dig up seedlings with soil from densely planted areas, being careful not to damage the roots. Move the seedlings to the small pits, compact the surrounding gaps, and water immediately after transplanting. This will help them survive.
    It is best to transplant on cloudy days, after rain, or in the early morning or evening. The seedlings should not be too large. Usually, the first thinning is done when the seedlings have one true leaf.
    II. Quickly Harrow Crusted Soil for Seedlings That Have Not Emerged
    For cotton planted before the rain, the soil surface crusts after the rain, forming a hard layer. For cotton seedlings that have not yet emerged, the crusted soil should be harrowed quickly. Because cotton is a dicotyledon, it is difficult for it to emerge. Failure to harrow will affect the germination of the cotton seedlings. Some experienced farmers use a harrow to break up the hard crust, loosening the soil. This not only makes it easier for the seedlings to emerge but also reduces soil moisture evaporation. However, some farmers still think it doesn't matter, believing that cotton seedlings can "lift the lid." This idea should be changed.

### 棉花补苗法

　　棉花补苗法
    一、缺苗补救方法：
    补种时先在坑内灌水，水渗后再播种，深度可和平常一样，周围土集成一小坟形，堆于上面，待苗将出土时平去，这样可保持水分，但须注意平堆不要晚了。补种如已晚，最好的方法便是补苗，棉花是深根作物，移植很困难，不过若能移之得法，也很容易活。老乡们施行栽苗，收效很大，兹将其法介绍于下：灌溉前先在缺苗处作小坑，再从苗稠处用锨将苗带土掘起，注意勿损伤根，移于小坑内将周围缝隙踏实，随移随浇水，便可以活了。
    移时最好在阴天雨后清晨傍晚，苗不要过大，普通第一次疏苗在真叶一枚时行之。
    二、苗未出土者快耙结板
    雨前种的棉花，雨后因地皮结成一层硬板，棉苗未出土者，应快耙结板。因棉是双子叶，出土很难，不耙影响棉苗发芽，有的老乡用耙将硬结板耙碎，使地皮轻松，这样苗不但易于出土，并可减少土壤之水分蒸发。但是还有部分老乡认为不碍事，棉苗能顶锅盖，这思想应该改掉。
