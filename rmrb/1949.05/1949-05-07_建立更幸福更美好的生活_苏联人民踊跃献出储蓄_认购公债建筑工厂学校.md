Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: TASS reports: The Soviet government's decision to issue the Fourth National Economic Restoration and Development Bonds has been warmly received by millions of Soviet people. The "Pravda" correspondent in Leningrad emphasized that the surge of patriotism sparked by the new bonds has swept through all sectors of the city. Grand meetings were held in factories, schools, and institutions. Skilled workers and young workers, students, professors, teachers, and scientists warmly welcomed the government's decision. Comrade Timofeev, a technician at the Kirov factory, said to the workers of the factory: Our factory was once at the front line, and enemy artillery fire and bombs caused it to suffer major damage. Today, in the place that was once the front line, beautiful new homes have been built, and our workers have moved into them. This is just one of the countless examples of the Soviet government's concern for the working people. We are happy to give our savings to the state so that we can continue to build new factories and manufacturing plants, new schools and apartments on a large scale, so that our lives can become happier and better.

A "Izvestia" reporter from Minsk reported on the mass meetings in factories, construction sites, schools, and institutions in this capital of Belarus. Large numbers of subscribers were also reported in other Belarusian towns such as Vitebsk, Gomel, Bobruisk, Grodno, Brest, and other places.

In Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, the newspaper's reporter visited many business departments and felt very satisfied with the news of the new bonds. At the meeting of the Stalin Locomotive Repair Factory, Comrade Abuasivili, the leader of the work team that had completed the ten-year production quota, delivered a speech expressing the workers' feelings and love. He said: Every Soviet patriot should help the country with his savings. They subscribe to the new bonds with joy. Other factories in Georgia, gatherings at the Academy of Sciences, schools, institutions, and collective farms all expressed enthusiastic responses to the new bonds.
