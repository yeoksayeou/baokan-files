North China Labor Representatives' Conference
    Li Zaiwen Reports on Labor Movement Tasks
    Calls for Leading Role in Production Development

[This newspaper dispatch] The North China Labor Representatives' Conference held its second congress yesterday (the 3rd) at 10:00 AM. The presidium of the congress first announced a proposal to send a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and also to send a telegram to the frontline commanders and soldiers, celebrating their victories in liberating Nanjing and Taiyuan. This proposal was immediately and enthusiastically approved by all the representatives. Following this, Li Zaiwen, director of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, reported on "The Current Tasks of the North China Labor Movement." He first explained that the entire territory of North China has been completely liberated, and the North China working class, which had long been divided by the enemy, has victoriously converged from long-term, different forms of arduous struggle, forming the main force for restoring and developing industrial production to build a new North China. The scale of North China's industry is second only to the Northeast, ranking second in the country, part of which was built under extremely difficult conditions during the Anti-Japanese War. During this period, the working class displayed a high degree of initiative and a heroic spirit of struggle to overcome difficulties, defeating the enemy's "Three Alls Policy," producing many labor heroes and model workers, and accumulating rich experience, creating various favorable conditions for restoring and developing production in the future. Based on these circumstances, he proposed that the overall task of the North China labor movement in the future is to rapidly restore and develop industrial production, gradually transform consumer cities into production cities, help farmers improve agricultural technology, support the national liberation war, and realize the task of liberating the whole country as soon as possible. At this point, the report continued to raise several issues that must be resolved in order to restore and develop production. The main points are to strengthen a comprehensive production plan including supply, production, and consumption; various aspects should cooperate and plan uniformly; democratic management must be implemented in state-owned enterprises, and factory management committees and employee representative conferences must be established. This is an important link in running people's enterprises well and is a fundamental difference from the old bureaucratic enterprises; in private enterprises, the policy of "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital" must be implemented. He also emphasized that only by conscientiously implementing the principle of benefiting both labor and capital can production be developed, and only by striving to develop production can the policy of benefiting both labor and capital be realized. Also, strengthening trade union work, worker education, and worker welfare. Finally, Comrade Zaiwen emphasized that in order to rapidly restore and develop industrial production, it is necessary to strengthen worker unity and consolidate and expand the organization itself, so as to give full play to the great constructive spirit and leading role in restoring and developing production, and hoped that the conference would concentrate its efforts on studying these issues. After discussion, a resolution should be made for good implementation in the future. The report lasted five hours. During the meeting, congratulatory telegrams poured in from all sides, totaling eighteen congratulatory telegrams received from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the All-China Students' Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, the Ordnance Bureau, etc. These congratulatory telegrams gave the attending representatives great excitement and encouragement.
