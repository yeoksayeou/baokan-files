　　A Few Words
    Waiting and Seeing is of No Use
    The preferential exchange period for gold, silver ornaments, and properties in the Ping Municipality has ended. With the approval of the People's Bank of Beiping Branch, 125 businesses have converted their operations. However, some businesses are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude, attempting to cling to the past, and missing the opportunity for preferential exchange. It should be understood that transforming a consumer city into a production city is an established and unswerving policy of the People's Government. Such luxury industries were products of the old society and have no future in the people's city. If they do not convert their operations today, they will inevitably be eliminated naturally in the future. The government's preferential purchase of gold and silver is aimed at helping gold and silver ornament businesses to convert their operations, turning dead capital into active capital. Since gold and silver are not allowed to circulate, and the gold and silver ornament industry is bound to decline, these businesses are advised to make plans for conversion as soon as possible. Waiting and seeing is of no use.

　　三言两语
    观望没有好处
    平市金银饰物业优待兑换期已截止，经人民银行北平分行核准转业兑换者一百二十五家，犹有部分商号仍持观望，企图恋栈，自失优待兑换良机。须知变消费城市为生产城市，为人民政府既定不移的方针，此类奢侈行业，原为旧社会产物、在人民的城市里必无发展前途，今天不转业，将来亦必自然被淘汰。政府优待收兑金银，目的是在帮助金银饰物业转业，使死资金变成活资本，金银既不准流通，金银饰物业又必衰退，奉劝这些商号，还是应该早作转业打算，观望是没有任何好处的。
