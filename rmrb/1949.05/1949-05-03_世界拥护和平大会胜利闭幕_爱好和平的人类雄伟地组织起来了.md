    The World Peace Congress, held simultaneously in Paris and Prague, concluded successfully on April 25th after six days of meetings. This congress strongly attracted the attention of all peace-loving people around the world, and progressive newspapers across the globe published news of the congress in prominent spaces. The congress united over 600 million organized people from 72 countries fighting for world peace, and through them, united even more people. The propaganda organs of American and British imperialism had predicted that the congress would fail to unite the intellectual circles of various countries. However, the progress of the congress reflected that not only were the progressive intellectual circles of various countries determined to unite with the working people, but all peace-loving humanity was also determined to unite to break the threat of a new war and strive for lasting peace. Peace advocates were satisfied (while warmongers were disappointed) to see the adoption of the World Peace Congress's declaration to all people of the world, and the establishment of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee. The congress's檄文(xiwen) denouncing the warmongers confidently declared: "We are prepared and determined to strive for victory in the struggle for peace and survival." This committee, leading the struggle to defend peace, will strive to promote peace activities and develop peace forces. The movement supporting the World Peace Congress for the past two months, the peace demonstration of 500,000 people at the Buffalo Stadium in Paris, and the success of the Peace Congress, have repeatedly proven that the democratic forces of the world's people and the peace-loving will of the world's people are invincible; as long as the peace-loving people of the world work together, war can certainly be avoided, and lasting peace can certainly be achieved.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 30th: At the request of the US representative to the United Nations, Jessup, the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, has held several informal talks with Jessup on the Berlin issue since March 15th. These talks have recently been publicly announced. The most recent meeting between the US and Soviet representatives took place on April 27th, with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko also participating. During the talks, the US representative raised questions to the Soviet representative regarding the Berlin currency issue, various restrictions in Berlin, and the convening of a foreign ministers' conference, and submitted a memorandum to the Soviet government on the positions of the US, British, and French governments on the latter two issues. The US government's diplomatic probing on the Berlin issue and its purpose have attracted the attention of world opinion. Whether the US government is sincere in these informal diplomatic negotiations has been called into question by its recent intensified activities in promoting the division of West Germany.

    世界拥护和平大会胜利闭幕
    爱好和平的人类雄伟地组织起来了
    在巴黎和布拉格同时举行的世界拥护和平大会，经过六天的会议，于四月二十五日圆满地闭幕了。这个大会强烈地吸引了全世界一切爱好和平人民的注意力，全球的进步报纸都用显要的篇幅刊登大会的消息。大会团结了七十二国六万万以上为世界和平而斗争的有组织的人民，并且通过他们团结着更多的人民。美英帝国主义的宣传机关曾经预言：大会不能把世界各国知识界团结起来。然而，大会的进程反映出，不但世界各国进步的知识界决心和劳动人民联合起来，而且一切爱好和平的人类都决心联合起来，打破新战争的威胁，争取持久的和平。和平拥护者满意地（而战争贩子则失望地）看到了世界拥护和平大会告全世界一切人民宣言的通过，看到了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的建立。和平大会声讨战争贩子的檄文充满信心地宣布：“我们已准备和决心争取为和平与生存而斗争的胜利”。这一个领导保卫和平斗争的委员会，将为推广和平活动和发展和平力量而努力。两个月来支持世界拥护和平大会的运动，巴黎布法罗运动场五十万人的和平大示威，以及和平大会的成功，一再证明了：世界人民的民主力量，世界人民的爱好和平的意志，是不可战胜的；只要世界爱好和平的人民共同努力，战争一定能够避免，持久的和平一定能够取得。
    由于美国驻联合国代表耶塞普的要求，苏联驻安理会代表马立克自三月十五日以来曾与耶塞普就柏林问题数度举行非正式会谈，这一会谈已于最近公开宣布。美苏代表最近的一次会谈于四月二十七日举行，苏联副外长葛罗米柯亦参加。在会谈中间，美国代表曾就柏林货币问题、柏林方面各种限制问题以及召开外长会议问题向苏联代表提出询问，并就美英法政府对后两个问题的立场向苏联政府提出备忘录。美国政府此次在柏林问题上所进行的外交试探及其目的，已引起世界舆论的注视。美国政府在此次非正式外交谈判中究竟有无诚意，已经因为它在最近期间加紧推行分裂的西德国家的活动而引起人们的怀疑。
