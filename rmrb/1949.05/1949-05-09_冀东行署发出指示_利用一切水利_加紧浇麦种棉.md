    Jidong Administrative Office Issues Instructions
    Utilize All Water Resources to Intensify Wheat Watering and Cotton Planting
    [Tangshan Electric Dispatch] Since the beginning of spring, there have been many winds and little rain throughout the Jidong region. The Fourteenth District (Pinggu, Xianghe, Sanhe, Shunyi, Miyun, and other counties) has not had a thorough rain, and the drought is relatively serious. The Jidong Administrative Office issued instructions to all special districts and counties on April 26, pointing out specific measures to overcome the drought: 1. Counties and districts with well-digging conditions should quickly instruct districts and villages to start well-digging work to water wheat and plant cotton. 2. Counties and districts with conditions for opening canals to divert water should quickly lead villages to open canals to divert water for irrigation, watering wheat and planting cotton. 3. Counties and districts that can use existing small rivers and streams to build dams to water the land should lead farmers to build dams to water the land and plant cotton. 4. Counties without the above conditions, only drinking water wells or large water pits in front of and behind villages, can carry water to water the seeds or cart water in buckets to water the land. This method can be used more in mountainous areas. 5. For special soil where wheat seedlings are blown away by the wind, a soil ridge can be dug every four or five rows in the wheat field parallel to the wheat rows to prevent wind and prevent the wheat seedlings from being blown away. 6. All counties, districts, and villages should make full use of new drought-resistant methods and hope to publicize them in newspapers and introduce their experiences.

    冀东行署发出指示
    利用一切水利  加紧浇麦种棉
    【唐山电】入春以来，冀东全区风多雨少，部分地区已呈旱象，十四分区（平谷、香河、三河、顺义、密云等县）始终未得透雨，天旱较为严重。冀东行署特于四月二十六日向各专、县发出指示，指出克服天旱的具体办法：一、各县区有挖井的条件者，赶快指示区村展开挖井工作，浇麦种棉。二、各县区有开渠引水条件者，赶快领导各村开渠引水灌溉，浇麦种棉。三、各县区借用旧有小河细流，能堵坝浇地者，即领导农民堵坝浇地种棉。四，各县无有以上各条件，只有吃水井或有村前村后之大水坑，可以挑水浇种或车拉水桶运水浇地。山地可多用此法。五、土质特殊，因刮风把麦苗刮掉者，可以在麦地里顺麦垄平行方向，每隔四五垄挖成土垄一条，预备挡风，可防止麦苗刮掉。六、各县区村有新的防旱方法尽量发挥，并希在报纸上宣传，介绍经验。
