[Jinan Electric] Severe drought has hit the entire Jinan area. Guaranteeing the completion of the economic crop planting plan is an important issue; how to ensure that emerged cotton seedlings do not die, and how to replant those that have died, is also a crucial task. Guangzong, Jixian, Weixian, Wuxun and other places are now beginning a campaign to protect, replenish and weed seedlings. The Guangzong County Committee issued an urgent instruction on May 13 to protect and replenish seedlings, pointing out that due to the drought, dry land, and strong winds, many emerging seedlings have been blown to death by the wind. For example, in Yangzhuang, nine mu were blown to death. The reason for this is that when planting, water was poured into the pit, and the soil cracked as soon as the seedlings were planted. Once the wind entered the cracks, the seedlings were blown to death. The instruction calls for quickly replenishing seedlings, and also calls for early weeding of cotton seedlings to make them drought-resistant and wind-resistant. Zhao Zhuang's cadres and party members, based on the victory of leading the masses to plant 35 mu more cotton than originally planned, promptly led the masses to weed the cotton seedlings early. Villager Cao Shimei has weeded the first time on his six mu of cotton, and Zhao Zengshan has weeded five mu. Zhao Degong said when weeding: "Before weeding, the cotton seedlings were yellow and dry, but after weeding, the wheat seedlings are green and look good." After completing the task of planting more than 700 mu of cotton, the village cadres of Xishageda and Nanliucun in the sixth district of Jixian County went to the fields to inspect and found that many cotton seedlings had died! Some mu had more than 500 dead seedlings. Labor hero Liu Cuimiao immediately cooperated with the village cadres to call on the masses to replant, ensuring that 1,200 seedlings were planted alive per mu. Under their active leadership, more than 40,000 seedlings were replanted in two days. The Wuxun Eighth District Committee, after leading the masses to complete the task of planting 5,505 mu of cotton, immediately worked out several methods to protect the seedlings: (1) Weed the cotton seedlings early; (2) Dig more wells to water the seedlings, to prevent the lack of rain; (3) Tie straw men in the cotton fields to prevent crows from harming the seedlings; (4) When picking seedlings, use your fingers to cut them off, do not pull out the whole plant, so as not to affect the remaining seedlings. At the same time, it is not advisable to pick them too early. At present, the movement to protect, replenish and weed seedlings is gradually expanding throughout the district.

　　威县武训等地
  　锄苗保苗补苗
    【冀南电】冀南全区亢旱不雨，保证完成经济作物种植计划，固是一重要问题；已出土棉苗如何保证不死，死了的如何补种，亦是一紧要工作。广宗、冀县、威县、武训等地，现正开始保苗补苗锄苗运动。广宗县委会于五月十三日紧急指示保苗补苗，指出天旱、地干、风多，出土幼苗已有很多被风吹死。如杨庄即吹死九亩，其原因都是点种时坑里浇水，苗一下土就裂缝，缝里一进风，苗就被吹死。指示除号召赶快补苗外，并号召早锄棉苗，耐旱抗风。赵庄干部党员在领导群众植棉超过原计划三十五亩的胜利基础上，及时领导群众早锄棉苗，村民曹史美点的六亩棉已锄了头遍，赵增善已锄了五亩。赵德功锄苗时说：“没锄时棉苗发黄发干，锄麦苗又青又好看。”冀县六区西沙疙瘩、南刘村两村村干部，于完成植棉任务七百余亩后，便到地里检查，发现棉苗死的很多！有一亩死五百多棵的。劳动英雄刘翠苗，当即协同村干部号召群众补种，保证每亩种活一千二百棵。在他们积极领导下，两天补种四万多棵。武训八区区委会，于突击领导群众完成五千五百零五亩植棉任务后，即时研究出几个保苗办法：（一）早锄棉苗；（二）多挖土井浇苗，以防天不落雨；（三）棉地内扎草人，防止乌鸦祸害；（四）摘苗时要用手指截断，不要全棵拔出，以免影响留下的苗。同时摘时不宜过早。目下全区保苗补苗锄苗运动，正逐渐扩展中。
