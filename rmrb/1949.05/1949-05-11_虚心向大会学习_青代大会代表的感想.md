Humbly Learn from the Congress
Reflections of Youth Congress Delegates

[Our Newspaper] Young soldiers, workers, students, art workers, and representatives from Taiwan and ethnic minorities attending the first National Youth Congress have been sharing their thoughts on the congress with reporters.

Hearing the Congress Report is Worth Half a Year of Study

Combat hero Lü Shunbao, who has received two special merits, two major merits, three model awards, and eleven medals and flags, happily spoke about the honor of attending the congress. He said that listening to the reports from the Commander-in-Chief, responsible comrades from the Chinese Communist Party, and various heroes and models was worth half a year of political study for him. He also frankly stated that when he first came to the meeting, he was somewhat unhappy because he was afraid of missing the southward advance, but now that thought is gone. He is now wholeheartedly focused on how to go back and effectively convey the decisions and spirit of the congress. Wang Yizhen, a representative of the People's Liberation Army Navy and a member of the presidium of the congress, said that he was most moved by the reports of the struggle experiences of youth representatives from various regions. He almost shed tears several times. He is determined to learn from these brave brothers and sisters.

Returning to Our Posts to Work Even Harder

Female textile workers and tram workers from Shanghai all said that they heard many model youths at the meeting playing a tremendous role in various jobs, and therefore felt that their past work was not enough. Now they hope to return to their posts as soon as possible, unite the vast number of young people, work harder, and live up to the expectations of this congress.

Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, believes that Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report at the congress was one of his most important gains at the congress. Ding Cong, a young cartoonist from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, said that the congress educated him a lot. For example, the representatives' lively, cheerful, and collective activities made him truly feel the need to break through the past small-circle activities. The congress discussions and group discussions, which he was not used to, also taught him how to combine theory with practice. He said that everything needs to be learned from scratch.

Willing to Join Hands with the Youth of the Motherland to Liberate Taiwan

Xie Xuehong, a famous Taiwan youth representative who led the "February 28th" revolution in Taiwan, and Wu Ketai, a student at National Taiwan University who participated in the "February 28th" revolution, both praised the vitality, strength, and bravery of the youth of the motherland. They said that this congress summarized the struggle experiences of Chinese youth over the past thirty years, especially in recent years, and established the guiding principles for participating in the construction of the new China in the future. They are willing to work hard alongside the youth of the motherland. At the same time, at the congress, youth representatives from all over the country expressed their determination and confidence to carry the revolution through to the end and liberate Taiwan, which made them even more inspired after being under enemy oppression for a long time. Representatives of the Gaoshan ethnic group in Taiwan thanked the representatives for their concern for the Gaoshan ethnic group, and the ethnic minorities are willing to contribute their share to the construction of the new democratic motherland.

[Another News] As the National Youth Congress is about to close, representatives from all walks of life continue to express their opinions on attending the congress.

Luo Huang, a People's Hero of East China from the Third Field Army, and Wang Jieshan, a special-class meritorious artillery hero from the Second Field Army, reflected that after attending this congress, their thinking and views are more comprehensive than before. In the past, they often only saw the importance of military work and did not understand the work of other departments and the rear areas very well. This time, attending the congress and hearing about the deeds of young workers and students from various regions participating in production, studying, and fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries, hearing about the heroic and arduous situation of guerrilla warfare in South China and Hainan Island, and hearing about the hard work of logistics personnel in the rear made them very moved. They expressed that they would learn these many advantages with the attitude of elementary school students and bring the spirit of this congress back to educate the soldiers. Lü Yushan, a militia hero from Jinnan in the Northwest Liberated Area, admitted that he used to think that there was nothing to do after the war was over, but after listening to the report, he realized that the task of the youth was very important. As Chairman Mao said, the Long March was only the first step, and the road is still long. He is determined to unite and organize young men and women, participate in the militia, join the People's Liberation Army, and organize young men and women to help each other in production and support the front lines.

The Congress is Truly a Democratic Great Unity of the Youth of the Whole Country

Tian Changqing and Gao Renying, representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association and the Young Women's Christian Association, honestly stated that before the meeting, they thought that the Young Men's Christian Association and the Young Women's Christian Association were only attending the congress as decorations, and they participated with a wait-and-see attitude. After participating, they realized that they had a share in the presidium and the congress committee, and the organizational charter clearly stipulated that it would unite progressive youths from all over the country regardless of class, religion, or political belief. In his report on the third day, Mr. Zhou Enlai mentioned that Mr. Mao Zedong emphasized the need to unite more than 90% of the people, and only then did they realize that this congress was truly a democratic great unity of the youth of the whole country. They also said that whether it was the congress, the group, or the presidium meeting, all the way to the final election, it fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic centralism, and also taught them how to apply democratic centralism in practice.

Zhang Jiyu, a youth worker from the Democratic League, believes that attending this meeting and listening to many reports is like reading many progressive books. He learned how to grasp policies and correct his thinking. And the typical reports of those model heroes made him realize the living examples of serving the people.

Listening to Comrade Zhou Enlai's Report – Finding a Way to Study Chairman Mao

[Another News] Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, gave a political report at the congress on the 7th, which aroused great attention from the representatives. Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, believes that the policy of broadly uniting more than 90% of the youth in the report was very educational for him. The report pointed out the tortuous nature of the revolutionary road, which especially solved the common problems in the current thinking of the students. Wu Ketai, a student representative from Taiwan, believes that Comrade Enlai's report gave him a deeper understanding of the United Front issue. Guo Lanying, the actress of "The White-Haired Girl," and Lü Shunbao, the combat hero, both thought that the part about studying Chairman Mao in the report was very enlightening to them. They all said that they used to think that Chairman Mao was a natural saint, who could not be learned from, and they did not know how to study him. After listening to the report, they realized that Chairman Mao became the leader of the Chinese people because of continuous learning and continuous progress. As long as everyone is determined, willing to be humble, and grasps the correct method, they will find a way to study Chairman Mao.

[Another News] Youth delegations from all walks of life are working hard to prepare programs for the closing party of this congress. Here is a song composed by composer Li Ling, directed by "The White-Haired Girl" actress Guo Lanying, and a poem written and recited by Dongying actor Fang Ying, accompanied by violins, a full set of gongs and drums, and singing, which is very good. More than 20 youth representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Democratic League, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the education field, the literary and art circles, the drama circles, and the scientific circles are participating in the Yangko dance. They quickly became familiar with each other in this joyful music and healthy Yangko dance. Laughter, songs, and the sound of gongs and drums filled the representatives' rest places.

    虚心向大会学习
    青代大会代表的感想
    【本报讯】参加全国青年第一次代表大会的青年战士、工人、学生、艺术工作者及台湾、少数民族的代表，纷纷对记者发表他们对这次大会的感想。
    听了大会报告抵上半年学习
    得过两次特功、两次大功、三次模范、十一面奖章奖旗的战斗英雄吕顺保，欢天喜地地讲着他参加这次大会的光荣，他说听到了总司令、中共负责同志和各位英雄、模范的报告，抵得上他半年的政治学习。他并坦白说出最初来开会时因怕赶不上参加南下大进军而有些不痛快，如今这个思想已经没有了，他一心一意只想着如何回去好好传达大会的决议和精神。人民解放军海军代表，大会主席团之一的王颐桢说，使他最感动的是各地青年代表斗争经历的报告，他几次都几乎要流泪，他决心要向这些勇敢的兄弟姊妹们学习。
    回到自己岗位更要努力工作
    上海的纱厂女工、电车工人都说，在会上听到很多模范青年在各种工作中发挥了巨大的力量，因此觉得他们过去做的工作太不够了，现在就希望能赶快回到自己的工作岗位，团结广大青年，更努力工作，不辜负这次大会的希望。
    全国学联主席谢邦定认为周恩来同志在大会上的政治报告，是他在大会上最重要的收获之一。从国统区来的青年漫画家丁聪说，大会教育了他很多，如各代表的活泼、明朗、集体的活动，使他切实感到有突破过去小圈子活动方式的必要；而过去没有习惯过的大会讨论和小组讨论，也使他学到了怎样把理论和实践配合；他说，一切要从头学起。
    愿与祖国青年并肩解放台湾
    领导了台湾“二二八”革命的著名的台湾青年代表谢雪红，参加过“二二八”革命的台湾大学学生吴克泰，都赞美着祖国青年的活泼、强壮、勇敢。他们说大会这次总结了三十年尤其是近年来中国青年的斗争经验，确立了今后参加新中国建设的方针，他们愿与祖国青年，并肩努力。同时在大会上，全国青年代表都表示了要将革命进行到底，解放台湾的决心和信心，使长期处在敌人高压下的他们，更为感奋。台湾高山族的代表则感谢代表们对于高山族的关心，少数民族愿为新民主主义祖国的建设，贡献出自己一份力量。
    【又讯】在全国青年代表大会即将闭幕的时候，各界代表继续发表他们对于参加大会的意见。
    第三野战军华东人民英雄罗璜，第二野战军特等功臣炮兵英雄王杰山反映：开过这次大会，自己的思想、看法比较以前更全面了。在过去，常常只看到军队工作重要，不很了解其他部分和后方的工作情况。这次参加了大会，听到各个地区的青年工人、学生参加生产、学习并和国民党反动派斗争的事迹，听到华南、海南岛等地游击战争的英勇艰苦的情况，听到后方勤务人员辛苦工作的努力，使自己非常感动。他们表示：自己要以小学生的态度学习这许多优点，并把这次大会的精神带回去教育战士。西北解放区晋南民兵英雄吕玉山承认以前的想法认为仗打完了就没有啥事干，听了报告后才知道青年任务十分重大，正如毛主席所说，万里长征只跨了第一步，路还长着呢。回去要决心团结和组织男女青年，参加民兵，参加人民解放军，组织男女青年生产互助，支援前线。
    大会真是全国青年的民主大团结
    青年会和女青年会的代表田常青、高仁瑛都老实说出开会以前都以为男女青年会参加大会只是陪衬，抱着观望的心情参加，参加后无论大会的主席团，大会委员会都有份，组织章程上又明白规定不分阶级、宗教及政治信仰，团结全国进步青年。第三日周恩来先生的报告中又提到毛泽东先生强调团结百分之九十以上人民，才认识到这个大会真是全国青年的民主大团结。他们又说不论是大会或小组或是主席团会议一直到最后选举，都充分表现了民主集中的精神，也使他们学会了民主集中制在实践过程中的运用。
    民主同盟的青年工作者张纪域认为参加这次会议，听了很多报告，就如看了很多进步的书籍。学习了如何掌握政策，端正思想。而那些模范英雄的典型报告，更使他认识到活生生的为人民服务的榜样。
    听周恩来同志的报告  找到学习毛主席的门路
    【又讯】中国人民革命军事委员会副主席周恩来同志七日在大会上的政治报告，引起了代表们极大的注意。全国学联主席谢邦定认为报告中广泛团结百分之九十以上青年的方针，对他教育很大。而报告中指出革命道路的曲台性，尤其解决了目前同学思想中普遍存在的问题。来湾学生代表吴克泰认为恩折同志的报告使他对于统一战线问题有进一步的认识。“白毛女”女演员郭兰英和战斗英雄吕顺保都以为报告中关于学习毛主席的部分对他们有很大的启示。他们都说以前总以为毛主席是天生的圣人，那里能够学习得上，也不知道要怎样学习，听了报告以后，才知道毛主席也是由于不断的学习和不断的进步，才成为中国的人民领袖。只要大家能下决心，肯虚心，掌握正确的方法，就找到学习毛主席的门路了。
    【又讯】各界青年代表团为了这次大会闭幕的联欢会，正在很紧张的预备节目。这儿有作曲家李凌作的曲，“白毛女”演员郭兰英的导演，朗诵家东影演员方荧朗诵自己写的诗，配合上大小提琴、全副锣鼓，加上伴唱，搞得很好。参加秧歌舞的就有全国总工会、全国妇联、全国学联、民主同盟、男女青年会、教育界、文艺界、戏剧界、科学界的青年代表二十多人，他们很快地，在这愉快的音乐，健康的秧歌舞中熟悉起来了，笑声歌声和锣鼓声洋溢在代表们的休息所。
