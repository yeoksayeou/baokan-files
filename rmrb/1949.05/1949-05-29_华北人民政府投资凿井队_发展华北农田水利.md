　　North China People's Government Invests in Well-Drilling Team
  　Developing North China Farmland Irrigation
    [News from Our Newspaper] In order to support and develop farmland irrigation, the North China People's Government is investing 1,959,800 catties of millet (equivalent to over 100 million yuan at the current millet price) in the Well-Drilling Engineering Team of the North China Water Conservancy Cooperative. This investment has been approved by the North China Finance Committee, and a contract was signed on the 24th of this month by the North China Water Conservancy Cooperative and the Chief Accountant of the North China People's Government. The contract stipulates that all payments or returns on this investment will be converted according to the millet price published in the People's Daily at the time, with the payment period and amount determined by the needs of the well-drilling engineering team. After signing the contract, the team has already withdrawn 12 million yuan in cash. Upon receiving this investment, the well-drilling engineering team will continue to carry out the well-drilling project according to its original plan (which began implementation in mid-May and is scheduled to be completed by the end of July). This plan specifies that thirteen new wells are to be completed in two and a half months. The specific construction is as follows: twelve irrigation wells will be drilled in the Xiyuan and Nanyuan areas near Beijing, and one well will be drilled in Huangcun using existing machinery. Five well-drilling machines have already been dispatched, and it is planned to gradually increase this to seven. Construction has commenced in both Nanyuan and Xiyuan. Another part of the plan is to repair 54 old wells (including those unfinished, damaged, or lacking equipment). These wells are distributed in Changli, Fengnan (southern Fengrun), Tongxian, Daxing, Baoding, Xincheng, Zhuoxian, Wanping, and other places. This repair project is now underway in succession. As of now, two wells have been repaired in Zhuoxian, four in Daxing, and one in Fengnan. When this plan is fully completed, there will be 67 irrigation wells. The well-drilling engineering team estimates that the total daily water output of all wells will be 134,000 tons, which can irrigate 33,500 mu of land, with an estimated increase in grain production of 5,025,000 catties.
