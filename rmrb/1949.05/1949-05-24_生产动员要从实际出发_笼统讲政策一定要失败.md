　　Production Mobilization Must Proceed from Reality
  　Generalized Policy Talk Is Bound to Fail
    [Taihang News] In the Taihang District, the propaganda and mobilization work for the production increase campaign has achieved certain results in most areas by implementing the spirit of the instructions from the North China Bureau and the Taihang District Party Committee. In some areas, the failure to analyze and study the local specific circumstances, and the generalized application of policies, has instead increased the masses' confusion. Most places first convened enlarged meetings of the county party committee to analyze the county's work foundation and the ideological situation of cadres and the masses, and to determine the methods and steps for mobilization. Then, various meetings were held, such as district cadre party representatives and labor heroes, to enable party members and cadres to recognize the importance and favorable conditions for leading the masses to develop production, by studying policies, understanding the situation, and recalling victorious struggles, thus resolving ideas such as abandoning production leadership or lacking confidence in leadership. Among the masses, on the one hand, various opportunities were used, such as the conclusion of land reform, the issuance of land certificates, the evaluation of output, and the people's schools, to publicize the party and government's policies and regulations concerning the development of production; on the other hand, various specific problems in spring plowing were resolved, and the masses were mobilized to discuss how to realize the call for increased production, and to help the masses formulate plans for getting rich. The production enthusiasm of both party members and the masses is very good. For example, Xiaosong Village in Changzhi has now collected 87,000 dan of fertilizer and 25,000 jin of oil cakes. In order to complete the production increase task, every household is still accumulating fertilizer, and the cooperative will obtain another 20,000 jin of oil cakes, striving to apply 60 dan of fertilizer per mu. In some other places, due to the failure to study the instructions from higher levels well and to analyze the local specific circumstances, only generalized talk of the situation and policies was given to everyone. As a result, although mobilization was carried out, it did not inspire the work enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Instead, it added some confused ideas and misunderstandings. For example, some people said, "The talk is good, but I can't understand it or remember it. What am I going to say to the masses when I go back?", and some even thought that "production increases by an inch, and the burden increases by an inch", or even "the protruding rafter gets wet first, it's enough to make a fuss about it". The District Party Committee has issued instructions to correct this deviation.

　　生产动员要从实际出发
  　笼统讲政策一定要失败
    【太行讯】太行区在增产运动的宣传动员工作中，大部地区贯彻了华北局和太行区党委的指示精神，获得一定成绩。部分地区未分析研究本地具体情况，笼统搬用政策，反而增加了群众的糊涂观念。大部地方多首先召开县委扩大会议，分析全县的工作基础和干部群众的思想情况，确定动员的方法和步骤。然后召开区干部党代表劳动英雄等各种会议，使党员干部从学习政策认识形势和回忆胜利斗争中，认识领导群众开展生产的重要和有利条件，解决了放弃生产领导或对领导无信心等思想。在群众中，一面利用结束土改、发土地证、评产量、民校等各种机会，宣传党和政府有关发展生产的政策法令，一面解决春耕中的各种具体问题，发动群众讨论怎样实现增产号召，帮助群众订发家计划。党员与群众的生产情绪都很好。如长治小宋村现已集肥八万七千余担，油饼二万五千余斤，为了完成增产任务，家家户户仍在积肥，合作社要再弄到二万斤油饼，争取每亩上肥六十担。另外一些地方，由于未很好学习上级指示和分析当地具体情况，只笼统地给大家讲形势讲政策，结果虽动员过了，但并未鼓舞起干部群众的工作积极性和生产积极性。反而增添一些糊涂思想和误解。如有人说“谈是谈的好，就是懂不了记不下，回去给群众讲个话？”，有的还认为“生产长一寸，负担长一寸”，甚至“下雨先湿出头椽，闹的差不多就算”，这种偏向，区党委已予指示纠正。
