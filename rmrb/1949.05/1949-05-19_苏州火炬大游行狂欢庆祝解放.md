Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 18th. Over 30,000 workers, students, and citizens of Suzhou held a grand celebration meeting on the 13th to celebrate the liberation, and held a torch parade that evening. Students from more than 30 universities and colleges, including Soochow University and the Social Education College, dispatched more than 50 propaganda teams and more than 10 propaganda trucks to explain the Eight Articles of Agreement of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the citizens on various streets. Although it was drizzling in the morning, and the Kuomintang bandit planes attacked at one point, the streets were still filled with jubilant crowds. When the procession of 2,500 workers from the Sulun Yarn Factory, who had come from ten miles away, appeared in the urban area, it aroused continuous cheers. The propaganda truck of the Electric Light Company was adorned with brilliant torches. The railway workers of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway sang songs such as "The East is Red" and "Follow the Communist Party" and poured into the giant stream of celebration. A rickshaw puller said happily to everyone he met, "I have been pulling a rickshaw for more than 20 years, and I have never been so happy as today. The old days were truly inhuman!" At the celebration meeting, Chen Chao-huan, the representative of the Military Control Commission, and Hui Yuyu, the mayor of Suzhou, spoke successively, calling on people from all walks of life in the city to work hard to produce and support the front line, so as to gradually build the ancient consumer city into a productive people's city. In their speeches, they emphasized that the working class is the main force in building a new city, and at the same time pointed out that it is necessary to unite all democratic strata to build together. Representatives from all walks of life, including workers, students, women, and the cultural circle, also took the stage to give speeches, expressing their common desire to build a new Suzhou.

　　苏州火炬大游行狂欢庆祝解放
    【新华社无锡十八日电】苏州市工人、学生及市民三万余人，于十三日举行盛大的庆祝解放大会，并于当晚举行火炬大游行。东吴大学、社会教育学院等三十多个大中学校学生出动了五十余队宣传队及十余辆宣传卡车，在各个街头向市民讲解中国人民解放军的约法八章。虽然上午下着蒙蒙细雨，国民党匪机并一度来袭，但是街头仍一处处都是欢欣鼓舞的人流。从十里以外赶来的苏纶纱厂二千五百工人行列在市区出现时，引起不绝的欢呼。电灯公司的工人宣传卡车缀满了灿烂的灯炬。京沪路的铁路工人们高唱着“东方红”和“跟着共产党走”的歌曲，涌进庆祝的巨流。一个黄包车夫高兴得逢人便说：“我拉了二十多年车，没象今天这样快活过。往日真不是人过的日子啊！”庆祝大会上，军管会代表陈超寰及苏州市长惠浴宇等相继讲话，号召全市各阶层人民努力生产，支援前线，以古老的消费城市逐渐建设成生产的人民城市。他们在讲话中强调指出工人阶级是建设新城市的主力军，同时指出必须团结各民主阶层共同建设。会上工人、学生、妇女、文化界等各界代表亦相继登台演讲，表示建设新苏州的共同愿望。
