    Chapter Two: The Communist Party (Part 2)
    Hearing this, DaShui was so angry that a lump formed in his throat, and he said resentfully, "Damn it, that's really vicious!" Sister-in-law said, "She's only been married for less than a year, how can she live like this in the future?" XiaoMei twisted her neck and said, "Anyway, I'm not going back!" Sister-in-law said, "Oh! What can you do if you don't go back?" XiaoMei said, "I'm going to be a female Red Army soldier!" Sister-in-law said, "Look at this silly girl! You can't even read, why would they want you?" DaShui quickly said, "Uh, uh, there are some who can't read too!" Just as he said this, Sister-in-law's children clamored to go to sleep, and DaShui went home.
    Unexpectedly, the next day, Zhang Jinlong brought people and dragged XiaoMei back home by force. DaShui was very worried, not knowing what would happen to XiaoMei after she went back. He wanted to inquire about it, but he thought, "If people see me, what am I to her?"
    A few days later, Hei Lao Cai sent a letter to ShuangXi, asking him to transfer Niu DaShui to the county for training. DaShui's father found out and secretly pulled DaShui aside and said, "Oh dear, if you take this training, you'll definitely become a soldier! Son, can't you not go? Let's talk to your cousin, can't they send someone else?" DaShui pondered and said, "Becoming a soldier isn't certain, I'm just afraid of being sent far away to work." The old man said anxiously, "Then you won't be able to farm!" DaShui saw that his father was old, his younger siblings were still young, and he was reluctant to leave his poor home and familiar land, so he was also thinking about it in his heart. He went to find ShuangXi, wanting to talk to ShuangXi about it.
    When ShuangXi saw him coming, he happily said, "DaShui, you're in luck this time! Once you're trained, your culture will improve, and your politics will progress, you'll be a big cadre! Don't look down on me, a country bumpkin, when you come back!" DaShui laughed at what he said. GaoTuner mumbled from the side, "Why is he going and not me?" ShuangXi said, "What are you rushing for! He's going this time, you're going next time, one by one." When DaShui saw that people were vying to go, he didn't mention it and hurried home to pack his luggage.
    The old man panicked and asked DaShui, "What, are you leaving?" DaShui said with a smile, "Don't be afraid, training is a good thing, people want to go but can't. I'll leave early tomorrow morning!" The old man saw that he had made up his mind, was stunned for a while, and didn't stop him any further. Instead, he rummaged in the broken box for a long time, found a bill, and gave it to him as pocket money. In the morning, DaShui left with a small roll of bedding.
    When Niu DaShui arrived at HuangHua Village and found Hei Lao Cai, he had only said a few words when he suddenly saw a young woman running in, her floral jacket covered in dirt and her hair disheveled. It was Yang XiaoMei. Yang XiaoMei said to Hei Lao Cai tearfully, "Brother-in-law, please save me. They won't let me live!" Lao Cai asked her what was going on. She sat down, her pair of watery eyes saw Niu DaShui, and she quickly turned her face away, facing Hei Lao Cai, unable to speak for a moment. Hei Lao Cai carefully asked her, and only then did he learn that the day Zhang Jinlong brought her home, he said, "Good, your legs are long, you go to your brother-in-law to complain at the slightest thing!" As he spoke, he slapped her in the face, locked the door from the inside, and the mother and daughter locked her in the room, leaving her with a lot of work to force her to do, and only giving her two cornbread buns to eat a day. The old woman also said, "There are no good people in Shenjia Village; if you go again, I'll break your legs!" XiaoMei couldn't bear it, and took advantage of Zhang Jinlong not sleeping at home that night. Before dawn, she secretly opened the door, jumped over the wall and escaped.
    XiaoMei said to Hei Lao Cai, "Brother-in-law, I really can't stay there anymore. Don't you often say 'fighting the Japanese doesn't distinguish between men, women, old, and young'? I made up my mind to be a female Red Army soldier and go to work. We don't know how to read, we don't have the ability, even if we fetch water for people, run errands... anything is fine. Anyway, I'm not staying at home to suffer!" Hei Lao Cai frowned, thought for a long time, and said, "Then how about you go for training?" XiaoMei asked, "What kind of work is training?" DaShui quickly said, "Uh, training is very good! It can improve your culture, and... improve your politics, it's just like going to school." XiaoMei said, "Alright! I'll go for training, anyway, I'm not going back!" Hei Lao Cai wrote a letter of introduction, and together with several other trainees, they went to the county. XiaoMei's mother-in-law's family couldn't find her for a while and didn't know where she had gone.

    The county training class was in a large mansion. DaShui and the others found the person in charge and handed in their letters. The person in charge was called Cheng Ping, in his thirties, wearing a gray coarse cloth military uniform, sitting at the table; he first registered their names, and then asked Yang XiaoMei very kindly, "Why did you come to train?" XiaoMei blushed, couldn't answer, and only said after a long time, "Just for training!" After Cheng Ping explained it to her, XiaoMei understood, smiled, and said, "Then... training is for... for the sake of not staying at home, so I can come out and work!" Cheng Ping smiled and wrote a few words on the paper; then he asked Niu DaShui, "Why did you come to train?" Niu DaShui came over, bowed deeply, and answered loudly, "Resolutely fight the Japanese!" Cheng Ping returned a salute, smiled, and asked, "If I ask you to lead a group of people to fight, would you dare?" DaShui blurted out, "Dare!" Cheng Ping nodded and went to ask others.
    DaShui looked out through the glass window and saw many men and women in the yard. He thought to himself, "How lively!" After Cheng Ping finished talking with them and gave them a few words of encouragement, he divided them into classes. In terms of life, women had a separate female team, but learning was done together by men and women. DaShui and XiaoMei happened to be assigned to the same study group. After being assigned to the class, when they were about to come out, DaShui suddenly remembered, took out a letter from his pocket, and said anxiously, turning around, "Hey! Hey! Who do I hand over this relationship to?" Cheng Ping quickly pointed to him, "Find Sister Chen!" DaShui saw a female comrade sitting beside the table inside, smiling and waving to him. DaShui walked over, and Sister Chen said to him in a low voice, "Don't shout! There are still 'masses' here." DaShui handed over the party relationship and then walked out with peace of mind.
    DaShui and XiaoMei were very unaccustomed to entering the training class for the first time. Class during the day, discussion meetings at night, getting up, sleeping, exercising, singing... everything was done with whistles; they felt dizzy and tight. When it came to eating, two or three hundred people were divided into stalls, millet porridge, radish soup, everyone ate very quickly; XiaoMei couldn't keep up and scalded her lips with blisters. At night, the men all slept on the floor in the room, with grass as mattresses and bricks as pillows; the women were treated better, and there were heated brick beds in the room. The house was very big, and the heated brick beds were cold, the weather was very cold, XiaoMei didn't bring a quilt, and shared one with a female comrade named Tian Ying; in the middle of the night, her legs cramped from the cold, and she kept crying, and she regretted it a little, "It's not as good as not coming!" She often thought of going back to her sister's house.
    Tian Ying was a middle school student and a party member, and she was also older than her. She often got up in the middle of the night to rub XiaoMei's legs and persuaded her not to go back; sometimes she coaxed her like a little sister, bought sesame cakes for her to eat, saying, "You eat one, I eat one, study hard, don't miss home." XiaoMei also felt that she couldn't bear the suffering if she went back to her mother-in-law's house; she couldn't escape Zhang Jinlong's clutches even if she lived in her sister's house; since she came out, once she arrived at the training class, she cut her hair, she made such a big determination at the time, so she had to fight for it; she gritted her teeth and got through it.
    DaShui also had diarrhea from catching a cold at night; but what worried him the most was learning. This training class had people from all walks of life, with uneven levels and different clothes. Everyone sat in the yard, basking in the sun while listening to the class. DaShui wrapped his head in a turban, wore a tattered cotton coat, tied a waistband, and inserted a small pipe, sitting in the front, looking up and listening attentively. However, he didn't understand anything about "the current situation," "the united front," "guerrilla tactics"... There was a teacher who was a veteran of the Long March, from Hunan, and asked him, "Do you listen understand?" DaShui stared with both eyes. Someone next to him laughed and said, "He's asking if you understand!" It was a joke. DaShui watched some people taking notes with a rustling sound, and thought to himself, "When will I be able to grind to the point where I can take notes!" (Attached picture)

    第二回　共产党（续二）
    大水听了，气得喉咙里挤了个疙瘩儿，愤恨的说：“他妈的，真歹毒啊！”表嫂说：“这还是娶了不到一年的新媳妇呢，往后的日子还能过啊？”小梅拧着脖子说：“反正我不回去了！”表嫂说：“唉！不回去可怎么着？”小梅说：“我当女红军去！”表嫂说：“看这傻闺女！你又不识字，人家要你啊？”大水忙说：“呃呃，不识字的也有呢！”刚说到这儿，表嫂的孩子们嚷着要睡觉，大水就回家了。
    想不到第二天，张金龙带着人，把小梅生拉活扯的弄回去了。大水很不放心，不知道小梅回去以后怎样了，他想打听打听，心里又盘算：“叫人家看着，我算是他的什么人呀！”
    过了几天，黑老蔡给双喜来信，要调牛大水到县上受训去。大水爹知道了，暗里拉着大水说：“啊呀，这一受训，可准得当兵啦！小子，你不能不去吗？咱们跟你表哥说说，另外派个旁人去不行啊？”大水寻思着说：“当兵倒不准，就怕派到远处去工作。”老爹着急说：“那也就种不成个地啦！”大水瞧他爹年纪大了，兄弟还小，自己又是穷家难舍，热土难离，心眼儿里也很活动。他就去找双喜，想跟双喜说说。
    双喜一见他来，就很高兴的说：“大水，这下你可‘得’啦！一受训，你文化也提高了，政治也进步了，你就是个大干部啦，你回来可别瞧不起我这个老粗啊！”说得大水笑了。高屯儿在一边嘟囔说：“怎么叫他去不叫我去呀？”双喜说：“你着什么急！这回他去，下回你去，一个个的来啊。”大水一看人家抢着去，他就不提了，赶忙回家打整行李。
    老爹慌了，问大水：“怎么你走啊？”大水笑着说：“不用怕，受训是好事儿，人家想去还去不成呢。我明儿一早就走！”老爹看他打定了主意，呆了一阵，也没再阻挡他，倒从破箱子里搜摸了半天，摸出一张票儿来，给他作零花。早上，大水夹着一个小铺盖卷就走了。
    牛大水到了黄花村，找着黑老蔡，刚说了两句话，忽然看见一个小媳妇跑进来，花条袄上滚着土，头发披散着，一看正是杨小梅。杨小梅哭哭啼啼的对黑老蔡说：“姊夫，你救救我吧。他们不让我活啦！”老蔡问她是怎么回事。她坐下，一对水汪汪的大眼睛瞧见了牛大水，连忙转过脸去，对着黑老蔡，一时说不出话来。黑老蔡仔细问她，才知道那天张金龙把她弄回家里，说：“好哇，你倒腿长，动不动就找你姊夫告状！”说着扇了她一个耳刮子，倒插上房门，娘儿俩把她关在屋里，丢下一大堆活儿逼她作，一天可只给两个窝窝吃。老婆子还说：“申家庄就没个好人；你再去，打折你的腿！”小梅受不住，趁张金龙这一夜没在家睡，天还不亮，就偷偷＠开门，跳墙逃了出来。
    小对黑老蔡说：“姊夫，那边我实在待不下去啦。你不常说‘打日本不分男女老少’吗？我早打定主意，要当个女红军，也去工作。咱不识字、没能耐，哪怕给人家提个水儿，跑个腿儿……干什么也行。反正不呆在家里受罪啦！”黑老蔡皱着眉头，想了好一会，说：“那么你去受训好不好？”小梅问：“受训是个什么工作呀？”大水忙说：“呃，受训可好哪！又能提高文化，又能……提高政治，就跟进学堂一个样。”小梅说：“行喽！受训就受训吧，反正不回去了！”黑老蔡给写了介绍信，还有几个受训的，一块儿到县上去。小梅的婆婆家，一时找不着她，不知道她到哪儿去了。

    县上的训练班在一所大宅院里。大水他们找到负责人，交了信。那负责人叫程平，三十多岁，穿着灰粗布军装，坐在桌子跟前；先把他们的名字登记了，就很和气的问杨小梅？“你为什么来受训啊？”小梅红着脸儿，答不上来，半天才说：“就是为了受训么！”程平给她解释以后，小梅才明白了，笑着说：“那……受训就是为了……为的是不在家待着，好出来工作！”程平笑了一笑，在纸上记了几个字；又问牛大水：“你为什么来受训呢？”牛大水过来鞠了个大躬，高声的回答：“坚决打日本！”程平回了个礼，笑着问：“要是叫你带一班人，领头打，你敢不敢？”大水冲口说：“敢！”程平点了点头，又去问别人了。
    大水隔着玻璃窗，往外一瞧，见院里男男女女好些人，心里想：“可热闹啦！”程平和他们谈完话，勉励了几句，就把他们编了班。生活上妇女单有一个女生大队，学习可是男女在一块儿的。大水和小梅刚好编在一个学习小组里。编好班，临出来的时候，大水忽然想起，从怀里掏出一封信来，转着身子，着急的说：“嗳！嗳！我这个关系交给谁呀？”程平忙指给他：“找陈大姐！”大水看见，里边桌子旁坐着个女同志，在笑着对他招手咧。大水走过去，那陈大姐低低对他说：“你别嚷嚷！这儿还有‘群众’呢。”大水交了党的关系，才放心的走出来。
    大水和小梅乍一入了训练班，都很不习惯。白天上课，晚上开讨论会，起床，睡觉，上操，唱歌……干什么都吹哨子；觉得昏头晕脑的，紧得厉害。吃起饭来，二三百口子，分成摊儿，小米饭，萝卜汤，大家吃得挺快；小梅赶不上，把嘴唇都烫出泡来了。晚上睡觉，男同志全在屋里睡地铺，垫的草，枕的砖；女同志优待点，屋里还有炕。房子很大，炕又是凉坑，天气很冷啦，小梅没带被子，跟一个叫田英的女同志伙着盖；半夜里冻得她腿肚子转筋，尽啼哭，心里有些后悔：“还不抵不来呢！”常想回姐姐家去。
    田英是个中学生，又是个党员，年纪也比她大，常半夜里起来给她转腿肚子，还劝她别回去；有时候把她当小妹妹似的哄着，买烧饼给她吃，说：“你吃一个，我吃一个，好好儿学习，别想家啦。”小梅也觉得，回婆婆家吧，受不了那个罪；住在姐姐家吧，也还是逃不出张金龙的手；既然出来了，一到训练班，把头发也剪了，当时下了那么大的决心，可总得争口气呀；咬咬牙也就过下来了。
    大水夜里着了凉，也闹肚子；可是他最发蹙的还是学习。这训练班，各阶层的人都有，程度不齐，服装也各色各样。大伙儿坐在院子里，一面晒着太阳，一面听课。大水包着头巾，穿着破棉袄，还束着个褡膊，插着个小烟袋儿，坐在前面，抬着头，眼巴巴的听课呢。可是，什么“目前形势”呀，“统一战线”呀，“游击战术”呀……他都听不懂。有个教员是长征老干部，湖南人，还问他：“你听等听不等？”大水瞪着两个眼儿。旁人笑着说：“问你懂不懂！”可闹了笑话啦。大水看着有些人哗哗哗的记笔记，心里想：“多会儿熬磨到能记个录，可就好了！”（附图片）
    杨小梅从张金龙家逃走。
