Comrades,

In the history of modern China, Chinese youth have always been the vanguard of the Chinese people's movement. Especially since the first establishment of a revolutionary organization for youth – the Socialist Youth League – in 1920, the Chinese youth movement has become an important force in the Chinese revolutionary movement. Subsequently, the Communist Youth League in the era of the Great Revolution and the Land Revolution, the China National Liberation Vanguard during the "December 9th" Movement and the early stage of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Youth National Salvation Association, the Youth National Salvation Corps, the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard during the War of Resistance, the Democratic Youth League, the New Democratic Youth League, and the Democratic Youth League in the Liberated Areas during the People's Liberation War, all played huge and positive roles in various revolutionary periods. The New Democratic Youth League, which is about to be formally established, inherits the glorious traditions of the past youth movement and raises the banner of a new youth movement in the new situation where the national revolution is about to triumph.

Since October 1946, when the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the proposal to establish the New Democratic Youth League, various liberated areas have successively established League organizations in various regions. In January of this year, the CPC Central Committee officially decided to establish the League universally in all regions. From October 1946 to today, two and a half years later, especially after the publication of the CPC Central Committee's decision on the establishment of the League, the Youth League has made great progress and has now grown to nearly 190,000 members. Our Youth League organizations, whether in factories, schools, or rural areas, have been loved by the broad masses of young people and the broad masses of the people, and have become the core of uniting and educating young people. In various tasks, the Youth League has begun to become a powerful assistant to the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government. In many places, the Youth League has led young people to participate in supporting the Liberation War, developing production, land reform, democratic construction, and cultural undertakings, and has played a significant role in these struggles and tasks.

At present, the rapid development of the Chinese revolutionary situation, the imminent liberation of the whole country by the People's Liberation Army, and the expansion of the influence of the Chinese Communist Party among the broad masses of the people have made the political awakening of the broad masses of young people more universal and more urgently in need of the Youth League to unite and educate them. This gives the Youth League ample conditions to better shoulder the great historical task of uniting and educating the younger generation to actively participate in the New Democratic revolution and construction. Therefore, formally establishing the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, discussing the Youth League's principles and tasks, formulating the Youth League's work program and constitution, and generating the National Committee of the Youth League have become the most central links in the current youth work in China. To this end, we are now convening the First National Congress of the Youth League to undertake this task.

This report will present six issues to the congress: the issue of the Youth League's tasks, the issue of work, the issue of work methods, the issue of work style, the issue of the relationship between the League and various parties, and the issue of the work of the Central Committee of the League.

I. The Basic Tasks of the Youth League

What are the basic tasks of the Youth League? The CPC Central Committee's decision on the establishment of the League pointed out: "It lies in systematically studying Marxism-Leninism, continuously educating its members and young people from revolutionary practice, and at the same time, organizing the broad masses of young people with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to actively participate in various movements called for by our Party and the People's Democratic Government."

In 1920, Lenin delivered a famous speech at the Congress of the Soviet Communist Youth League, pointing out that the basic task of the Youth League was to study. At that time, the young Soviet Republic had just defeated foreign interventionists with all its strength and was facing the new task of building a socialist society. In this new period, Lenin pointed out that the basic task of the Youth League was to study, to cultivate a Soviet worldview and communist morality, in order to become conscious builders of the new society.

Now, the situation in our China can be said to be similar to that of the Soviet Union at that time. Of course, the process of social development is different. The rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China is about to be completely overthrown by us, and a new democratic China led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance is about to be established. Chinese youth must not only continue to complete the task of overthrowing the old society, but also, and especially, take on the new task of creating and building a new democratic society. Building a new society on the basis of the dying old society is the most important task of the Chinese revolution today. Therefore, educating and cultivating the younger generation to actively participate in the construction of a new democratic society is the most basic task of the Chinese youth movement today. To ignore this point is a serious mistake.

What should the Youth League study? First of all, it should study Marxism-Leninism, learn the ideological method of dialectical materialism, and lay the foundation for a revolutionary outlook on life and the world. Without this, it will be impossible to understand for whom one is studying and for whom one is serving. The study of all scientific knowledge must be meaningful under the major premise of serving the working people.

However, Marxism-Leninism is not an abstract dogma. In addition to studying general theories, the study of Marxism-Leninism must also include learning the ideology that unites Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution – Mao Zedong Thought – and combining it with various revolutionary struggles and all aspects of work.

To build a new China, it is not only necessary to restore production, but also to greatly develop production. Without this, the victory of the revolution cannot be consolidated. To restore and develop production, it is necessary to rely on modern scientific knowledge, production technology, and management methods. These are all necessary for young people preparing to participate in the construction of a new society. It is necessary to learn the management methods and production technologies of factories, mines, railways, cooperatives, and large enterprises; to understand the production process and the distribution process; to understand how to improve farming methods, organize labor, and raise the level of agricultural production in China. Only when our revolutionary youth themselves master modern production knowledge and skills, and make China's industrial production greatly exceed the current level, can our new democratic economy stride forward towards a socialist economy.

To build a new democratic society, it is necessary not only to learn the knowledge of the struggle for production, but also to learn the knowledge of class struggle. It is necessary to learn to wage various military, political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic struggles against the enemy, not only to be able to defeat the enemies with guns, but also to defeat the hidden enemies without guns.

How does the Youth League conduct its studies? Our method of learning is to closely combine learning with struggle, learning with work, and learning with productive labor. In the past, some people doubted, saying that since the basic task of the Youth League is to study, isn't the Youth League no different from a general school? What is the use of the Youth League then? This idea is wrong. Youth League members in schools, of course, should become the best students in the school, not only studying the school's courses in the best way, but also studying well in the life of the League. In addition, Youth League members are certainly not limited to students. They must also learn in production, in work, in combat, and in various struggles. No matter where they are, the combination of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice should be the guide for Youth League members in their studies.

If the Youth League can understand and implement this basic task, it can cultivate itself to undertake the task of building a new society, it can become the core of uniting and educating the younger generation, and it can become a powerful assistant and reliable reserve force for the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government in various tasks.

This basic task and all the work of the Youth League must be carried out under the political leadership of the Communist Party. Because the Chinese Communist Party is the advanced party that leads the Chinese revolution based on the Mao Zedong Thought that unites communist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution. Only under the leadership of the Party can the Youth League accomplish its basic tasks.

II. The Work of the Youth League

The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed us that the general task of the Chinese people at present is to restore and develop the industrial and agricultural production, eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, support the front lines of the Liberation War, and restore and develop cultural and educational undertakings. The Second Plenary Session pointed out that the focus of the Party's work must shift from the countryside to the cities, and in the urban struggle, we must rely on the working class. The principles and tasks of the Youth League should be subordinate to this general principle and general task. It should lead the young people to actively participate in the above-mentioned work and struggle, and closely link the task of learning with the above-mentioned work and struggle.

The Youth League should not only propagate and educate Marxism-Leninism among its members and young people, but also conduct extensive propaganda and education among the general public. Especially in the newly liberated cities, this new education movement should be launched, explaining the principle that labor creates everything, explaining the unreasonableness of the old social system, and the issue of the transformation of the old society. In the schools and factories of the newly liberated cities, the following four studies must be carried out universally for the vast number of young people: (1) Historical Materialism, (2) The History of the Chinese Revolution and the Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution, (3) Various Policies in the New Democratic Revolution Stage, (4) The Tasks, Organization, and Youth League of Youth (and in factories, it is also necessary to study the organization of trade unions). When carrying out these studies in factories, youth training classes, seminars, and other forms should be organized in coordination with the trade unions or independently. In schools, these studies should be listed as courses, and study activities on these issues should be organized outside of class.

The fundamental purpose of carrying out the work of the League is to educate League members and young people in practical struggles and work, to strive to learn and master knowledge, to actively participate in labor, to participate in various construction undertakings of the New Democracy, to actively participate in the struggle to realize the interests of the working people, to struggle for the complete victory of the New Democracy, and to make every male and female League member and youth have a revolutionary outlook on life and the world, and to cultivate them into loyal servants of the working people and active builders of the new society.

Youth League in Factories

In order to participate in the restoration and development of urban production undertakings, to rely on the working class in urban struggles, and to increase the working class foundation of the Youth League, we must strengthen our work among young workers.

All work in state-owned factories and enterprises revolves around production activities. The Youth League must mobilize young workers to work together with adult workers to increase output, improve quality, reduce waste, care for machines, and save materials, and abide by labor discipline and develop correct labor attitudes.

In private factories and enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy of the New Democratic state, the Youth League and the general staff and workers should carry out production under the conditions of mutual benefit between labor and capital. However, it is necessary to educate and organize young workers, together with all staff and workers, to fight for the protection of the basic rights of staff and workers.

League members should not only become production models, but also become learning models. League members and non-League young workers can only give full play to their initiative and creativity in production if they study well. The Youth League must educate itself and young people outside the League with Marxism-Leninism. Improve their class consciousness and enhance their understanding of the revolution. Understand the truth that labor creates everything, understand that they are the masters of the New Democratic state, and consciously struggle for the construction of the New Democracy. They must be made to realize that state-owned factories and enterprises have already been owned by the New Democratic state led by the proletariat and are economic in nature of socialism, and they must be made to realize that private factories are private capitalist in nature, but because China's economy is backward, even after the victory of the revolution, the capitalist components that are beneficial to the national economy still need to be developed within the economic policies and economic plans of the New Democratic state. At the same time, Youth League members and non-League young people must learn and master production technology, learn culture, and organize various study activities such as research groups, lectures, night schools, newspaper reading groups, and question and answer sessions.

The Youth League should always care about the welfare of workers, such as promoting and organizing labor mutual assistance, assisting trade unions in running employee cooperatives well, participating in the management of factory administration, and ensuring the implementation of the decrees of the People's Government. Under the condition that production is not hindered, they should engage in various social service activities (such as comforting the People's Liberation Army, supporting the front lines of the People's Liberation War, etc.) and public affairs within the factory (such as cleaning workshops, tidying warehouses, etc.). In addition, it is necessary to actively organize leisure entertainment, sports, and other activities for young people and all staff and workers to liven up and adjust the workers' lives.

Youth League in Schools

The schools run by the People's Democratic Government are aimed at realizing the New Democratic education policy and cultivating various construction workers with revolutionary ideas and specialized knowledge to serve the working people. The Youth League in schools is to help students progress ideologically and behaviorally, to better cultivate service to the working people, to unite teachers and students, and to complete the implementation of the school's new New Democratic education plan, to enable themselves and to promote the vast number of students to study their lessons well, and to help and promote the student union to organize extracurricular study activities centered on regular courses. Youth League members in school must set an example in their schoolwork. The main work of the Youth League in schools is learning, which is to organize mutual assistance in learning under the guidance of teachers. They must first study their regular courses well, and at the same time, they must pay attention to participating in social service activities and cultural entertainment activities outside of class and during vacations. Prevent the bias of studying to death. Make the vast number of students realize that studying lessons is to better serve the working people and participate in the construction of a new China. Youth League members should study Marxism-Leninism and spread Marxism-Leninism theory and Mao Zedong Thought to the vast number of students, so that students can be cultivated into construction talents with a revolutionary outlook on life and the world and with rich knowledge and skills.

In private schools, especially in church schools, the Youth League should assist the government in helping students to strive for the realization of the New Democratic education policy, should help students to put forward correct and appropriate learning requirements, and realize students' basic rights in learning and life.

In the schools of the newly liberated cities, the Youth League should first assist the education organs and the school administration to carry out ideological reform and learning reform movements in a step-by-step and planned way, and carry out activities to oppose the sabotage activities of imperialism and counter-revolutionary special agents together with the vast number of students, so that it can become a people's school that implements the New Democratic education policy. And in this movement, establish and consolidate the New Democratic Youth League.

Youth League in Rural Areas

In the rural youth in the newly liberated areas, they should first actively participate in the struggle of all farmers against traitors and bullies and for rent reduction and interest reduction, and unite themselves, educate and organize the vast number of young people, and establish and consolidate the Youth League in the struggle. The work of the Youth League in the rural areas of the old liberated areas should be to restore and develop agricultural production together with all the farmers, and actively organize production, consumption, credit, and supply and marketing cooperatives and various mutual aid organizations. The Youth League must publicize the benefits of organization under the premise of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Advocate improving farming methods and help transform second-rate people to improve rural production. During the current war period, it is also necessary to actively participate in and support the Liberation War.

Carrying out cultural education in rural areas is the basic work of the League. League members themselves and organized young people, strive to learn culture, strive to learn scientific knowledge, oppose superstition, promote cleanliness and hygiene, strive to learn politics, and combine learning and developing production.

Youth League in the Army

In the People's Liberation Army, youth account for the majority. In order to strengthen education and unity for them, it is necessary to establish Youth League organizations to carry out youth work.

The Youth League in the army should systematically educate League members and young soldiers with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's political and military thought, help them improve their political understanding, military technology, and cultural level, and make them the shock force of all work and war in the army. Become a powerful assistant to the Party and political work, and become the core of cultural work and enlivening the army. The Youth League in the army should also help the local Youth League and participate in local youth work. Youth League members should make themselves heroic and courageous combat heroes who are proficient in military technology and models for implementing policies and discipline.

Regarding the organization and work of the Youth League in the army, after the congress, according to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions, the Central Committee of the League and the Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission will jointly formulate regulations and promulgate them.

Youth League among Urban Professional Youth and in Government Agencies

The Youth League among urban professional youth and the Youth League in government agencies should combine their own work with learning, cultivate themselves to lay the foundation for a revolutionary outlook on life, and become talents who are proficient in their work.

III. The Working Methods of the Youth League

The working methods and League life of the Youth League should not rely on abstract political talk, nor should it rely on dry and tasteless missionary preaching. The Youth League should use the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to correctly analyze and solve various problems related to the vital interests of young people, such as wages and health issues, career issues, sports and entertainment issues, learning science and improving culture issues, tuition and loan issues, examination issues, love and social issues, family issues, learning methods and book issues, how to coordinate work and learning issues, and so on. In analyzing and solving these problems, enlighten League members and the vast number of young people to have a correct understanding of the above problems, guide them to understand Marxism-Leninism, cultivate them to form a Marxist-Leninist outlook on life and the world, and devote themselves to the cause of the complete liberation of the whole of China and the whole of mankind.

All youth conferences convened by the Youth League must be lively and lively. There must be full preparation before the meeting, each meeting must have a center and a purpose, each meeting must be able to solve problems, and those attending must be educated. Unnecessary meetings that are neither prepared nor purposeful should not be held. In Harbin City, Northeast China, they established a "League Day" system, stipulating that it should be held once a week or every two weeks. On "League Day", special reports, discussions, debates, transmitting instructions from higher levels, arranging current work tasks, holding League admission ceremonies, introducing model deeds of League members, helping each other, learning and criticism, League lectures, storytelling, revolutionary competitions, singing, entertainment evenings, and other collective activities are carried out. This concise, lively, and educational "League Day" method can be imitated by various regions. In short, the Youth League should create various working methods that suit the characteristics and interests of young people. Only in this way can it unite and lead the vast number of young people to do all their work well.

IV. The Work Style of the Youth League

The Chinese New Democratic Youth League should have a work style of humbly learning, being realistic, serving the people loyally, and fighting bravely and fearlessly against the enemy. Youth League members must be diligent in studying revolutionary theory and various knowledge in work, struggle, and production, constantly and humbly learning without missing any opportunity, and cultivating themselves into various talents for the construction of New Democracy. Youth League members must have the scientific spirit of Marxism-Leninism, an honest attitude, and proceed from reality. For all issues, first seek to understand the situation, possess relevant materials, and then study and analyze them before drawing correct conclusions and making correct decisions. Every male and female League member should be good at adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes, that is, on the one hand, unswervingly adhere to the revolutionary truth, and on the other hand, correct their own mistakes with practical actions without reservation. Full play must be given to criticism and self-criticism, and to a democratic and serious work style within the League. It is necessary to advocate practicality, simplicity, and hard struggle, and oppose formalism and extravagance and waste. The Youth League should pay attention to and obey the greatest interests of the greatest number of people, and should have a spirit of collectivism and a sense of the whole. It is necessary to train League members' organization and discipline in their work. Cultivate a correct sense of organization, and good morals and habits of consciously observing revolutionary order and discipline. The Youth League must closely link with the masses, listen to the correct opinions of the people and young people. It only has the obligation to publicize and educate the masses, and does not have any right to force orders on the masses. Youth League members must be brave enough to take responsibility for their work, be energetic, and have initiative and creativity, and not bow their heads in the face of all difficulties. And resolutely overcome it. They must have unlimited loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and resolutely and mercilessly fight against imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and all counter-revolutionaries.

That is to say, the members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League should be: under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, working hard, cultivating themselves to be loyal to the working people, knowledgeable, brave, resolute, not afraid of hardship, hating the enemies of the working class, having a determined spirit that will not stop until the goal is achieved, and having characters and qualities of being invincible and unconquerable.

The Youth League must always pay attention to preventing arrogance and impatience. This is especially important at a time when the New Democratic revolution is about to achieve victory on a national scale.

V. The Relationship Between the Youth League and Various Parties

What is the relationship between the New Democratic Youth League and the Communist Party? The New Democratic Youth League must resolutely support the Chinese Communist Party and fully accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Youth League is the core for the Party to unite and lead the vast number of young people, a school for the Party to educate young people with Marxism-Leninism, and the Party's reserve force and assistant. It unites and educates the entire younger generation around the Party and the People's Democratic Government.

The New Democratic Youth League is a non-Party mass organization and should maintain its own independent system in organization; however, Party members within the Youth League must obey all resolutions of the Party and consolidate the Party's leadership over the Youth League with tireless persuasion and education work and their own exemplary actions.

However, in order for the Youth League to be able to better shoulder the task of uniting and educating the entire younger generation, it not only relies on the efforts of League members, but more importantly, on the strong leadership of the Party. Therefore, the most outstanding Party members and cadres must serve as the foundation and backbone of the League. The work of the League at all levels must be led by the secretaries or standing committees of the Party committees at all levels in person, and they must regularly attend the meetings of the League at the same level. The work of the Youth League should be listed as an important and regular agenda item of the Party committees at all levels. The secretaries of the Youth League committees at all levels should preferably be the members of the Party committees at the same level, or the secretaries of the Youth League committees at the same level should be absorbed to participate in the Party committee meetings. The transfer of secretaries and deputy secretaries of Youth League committees at all levels must be approved by the Youth League committee at the next higher level and reported to the Youth League committees at the two higher levels for record. The selection of Youth League committees at all levels should also be approved by the Youth League committee at the next higher level.

The relationship between the Youth League and the People's Democratic Government is: the Youth League must respond to the call of the government, and League members must become models for abiding by government decrees, but it is not an affiliated organization of the government.

It is hoped that local governments will provide solutions for the expenses of running League schools and training classes, publishing League publications and youth reading materials, as well as League activities and undertakings at all levels of the Youth League, in order to facilitate the progress and development of the Youth League's work.

What is the relationship between the Youth League and the trade union? The Youth League in the factory is the organization of advanced young workers. Under the unified leadership of the Party, it unites and educates all young workers, carries out unremitting work among young workers, responds to and implements all the correct calls and resolutions of the trade union. However, the trade union should not interfere in the internal life of the Youth League. Nor can it replace the organizational system of the Youth League. Some comrades misunderstand the Youth League as an affiliated organization of the trade union, which to some extent restricts the independent activities of the Youth League and shackles the initiative and creativity of the Youth League, which is wrong. On the other hand, some comrades use the particularity of young workers as an excuse to disconnect Youth League members from the entire workers' movement, which is also wrong. As a trade union member, a Youth League member has the obligation to obey the resolutions of the trade union on general work issues. However, on issues related to young workers, the trade union should pay attention to soliciting the opinions of the Youth League before making a final decision. If disputes arise between the trade union and the Youth League that cannot be resolved, they should be resolved through the Party organization or the superiors of the League and the trade union. The Youth League at all levels should select the best League members to participate in the work of the Youth Workers Department of the trade union at the same level. The position of the head of the Youth Workers Department should preferably be held by a Youth League member and participate in the committee of the League at the same level, so that the work can be better coordinated.

What is the relationship between the Youth League and schools, farmers' associations, democratic youth federations, and democratic women's federations? The Youth League is not an affiliated organization of schools, farmers' associations, democratic youth federations, or democratic women's federations, nor is it an organization that opposes schools, farmers' associations, democratic youth federations, or democratic women's federations. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the Youth League responds to the calls of schools, farmers' associations, democratic youth federations, and democratic women's federations, and actively implements the correct resolutions of these organizations.

When requested or agreed upon, the League organization should send the strongest cadres to work in people's education organs, labor protection organs, school administrations, and various organs that are closely related to youth, in order to facilitate close work connections and mutual cooperation. This is of great benefit to helping to implement the work of these organs and cultivating reserve forces in all aspects of the Party.

The cadres sent to the government, schools, and other organs and organizations should implement the resolutions of the Party and the Youth League, urge compliance with the government's decrees on protecting the interests of youth, participate in the general work of the organs, learn the work of the organs, participate in the leadership organizations of the organs under certain conditions, and regularly report and study the work to the Youth League organizations that appointed them as representatives.

VI. The Work of the Central Committee of the Youth League

At this congress, we will elect the leading organ of the Youth League, the Central Committee of the League. After the establishment of the Central Committee of the League, it will lead the Youth League and youth work in various regions under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The Central Committee of the League must be good at summarizing the experiences and lessons of youth work, combine them with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and the practice of Chinese youth work, generalize them to form systematic experiences, and then use them to guide the national youth movement. It is necessary to be good at helping Youth Leagues at all levels learn to summarize their work.

After a short period of preparation, the Central Committee of the League will publish the newspaper of the Central Committee of the League. At present, the "China Youth" publication run by the Youth Work Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is used as its own organ publication, and this publication is used to organize the vast number of young people to study and guide the work of the Youth League. It must systematically educate League members and non-League young people with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and make League members and non-League young people solve their most concerned and vital issues through this publication. Youth League committees at all levels should attach great importance to this publication and mobilize League members and the vast number of young people to contribute articles, provide opinions, organize communications, and promote distribution. This publication should not only play a role in publicity and education, but also play a role in the organization of the League.

In addition to publishing "China Youth", the Central Committee of the League should plan and systematically edit League member textbooks, edit popular youth reading materials, and publish a series of books to educate the vast number of young people. And assist League organizations in various regions in holding lectures, speeches, seminars, and other cultural activities to publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

The Central Committee of the League will use the New Democratic Youth League School, which is run by the Youth Work Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as the Central League School. In this school, a large number of young cadres should be continuously trained and sent to various regions to serve in the League after graduation. The courses in the League School are Marxism-Leninism, New Democracy, Party policies, League building, and youth work. Because the South will soon be liberated, the League School should immediately train a group of cadres to go south to build the League. Similarly, various regions should open League schools or training classes to train cadres.

The Central Committee of the League will strengthen its leadership over the Youth Art Theater, so that the personnel of this theater can study Marxist-Leninist art theory and use artistic forms to publicize the Party's policies. At the same time, through this theater, it will study and guide the cultural, entertainment, art, and publicity work of the Youth League at all levels.

At present, the focus of the Youth League's work is in the cities. The Central Committee of the League should strengthen its leadership over urban youth work, especially the youth work in factories and schools. In factories and schools where the Youth League has not yet been established, the League should be established in a deliberate and step-by-step manner. But at the same time, it should take care of the countryside and never lose the countryside. In places where the League has not yet been established, the League should be established with a focus. In rural areas where the League has been universally established, leadership should be strengthened with a focus. The League should be tried out in the field armies of the army with a focus. In the rear armies and military organs, the work of establishing the League should be started universally. The Youth League should send excellent cadres to lead the work of children and youth.

The Central Committee of the League should guide the vast number of young people in China to participate in the international youth anti-imperialist democratic peace movement and strengthen ties with the democratic youth movements in various Eastern countries. The Central Committee of the League should guide the vast number of young people in China to support and participate in the world peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union together with the Chinese people, oppose the international aggression camp headed by US imperialism that is conspiring to prepare for and instigate war, and fight for lasting peace and people's democracy in the world and for the complete liberation of all mankind.

Comrades! The goal that our Chinese youth have been striving for for many years: overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China - is about to be realized. A new and more arduous task - the task of building a New Democratic country - is placed before us. We firmly believe that the Chinese youth, who have experienced great struggles, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will definitely be able to shoulder the historical task given to us by the Communist Party and the people. All comrades of the New Democratic Youth League, together with the youth and people of the whole country, resolutely fight together to build a New Democratic country!

    青年团的任务与工作
    一九四九年四月十二日，冯文彬同志在中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会上的报告各位同志：
    中国青年，在近代中国的历史中，向来是中国人民运动的先锋。特别是从一九二○年第一次建立了青年自己的革命组织——社会主义青年团以来，中国青年运动成了中国革命运动中一支重要的队伍。此后大革命时代和土地革命时代的共产主义青年团，“一二九”运动中及抗战初期的中华民族解放先锋队，抗战时期的青年救国会、青年救国团、广东青年抗日先锋队、人民解放战争时期的民主青年同盟、新民主主义青年联盟、解放区的民主青年联盟，都在各个革命时期中起了巨大的积极作用。即将正式成立的新民主主义青年团，就是继承着以往青年运动的光荣传统，在全国革命即将胜利的新形势下，举起新的青年运动的旗帜。
    自一九四六年十月，中国共产党中央发出了建立新民主主义青年团的提议以后，各解放区陆续在各个地区建立了团的组织。今年一月，中共中央正式决定各地普遍建团。从一九四六年十月到今天，两年半以来，特别是中共中央建团决议发表以后，青年团有了很大的发展，现在已经发展到近十九万人。我们的青年团组织不论在工厂、学校或农村，都受到了广大青年群众和广大人民群众的爱护，成为团结与教育青年群众的核心。在各项工作上，青年团开始成为共产党和人民民主政府的有力助手。青年团在许多地方领导了青年群众参加支援解放战争、发展生产、土地改革、民主建设和文化事业等工作，并在这些斗争和工作中，起了重大的作用。
    目前中国革命形势迅速的发展，人民解放军即将解放全国，中国共产党在广大群众中影响的扩大，使得广大青年的政治觉醒，更加普遍地提高，更加迫切地需要青年团去团结与教育他们。使得青年团有充分的条件，更好地担负起团结与教育青年一代，去积极地参加新民主主义的革命和建设的伟大的历史任务。因此，正式成立中国新民主主义青年团，讨论青年团的方针与任务，制定青年团的工作纲领与团章，产生全国青年团的中央委员会，成为目前中国青年工作中最中心的环节。为此，我们现在召开全国青年团第一次代表大会，来担当这个任务。
    这个报告所要向大会提出的有六个问题：就是青年团的任务问题、工作问题、工作方式问题、工作作风问题、团与各方面的关系问题和团中央的工作问题。
    一、青年团的基本任务
    青年团的基本任务是什么呢？中共中央建团决议中指出：“是在于有系统地学习马克思列宁主义，从革命实践中不断地教育自己的团员和青年群众，同时应当以马克思列宁主义的精神组织广大青年群众积极地参加我党和人民民主政府所号召的各种运动。”
    一九二○年列宁在苏联共产主义青年团代表大会上发表过一个有名的演说，指出青年团的基本任务，就是学习。那时，年青的苏维埃共和国刚刚用全力打败了外国干涉者，面临着建设一个社会主义社会的新任务。在这个新时期，列宁指出青年团基本任务，就是要学习，要养成苏维埃的世界观和共产主义道德，以便成为新社会的自觉的建设者。
    现在，我们中国的形势可以说与那时的苏联有类似之点。当然，社会发展的进程是不同的。帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，即将被我们完全推翻，无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的新民主主义的中国即将建立。我们中国青年不只要继续完成打垮旧社会的任务，而且，应当特别提出的，要担任创造与建设新民主主义社会的新任务。在即将灭亡的旧社会的基础上建设新社会，是今天中国革命头等重要的任务。因此，教育培养青年一代积极地参加新民主主义社会建设。也就是今天中国青年运动最基本的任务。如果忽视了这一点，就是一个严重的错误。
    青年团学习些什么呢？首先，应该学习马克思列宁主义，学习辩证法唯物论的思想方法，奠定革命的人生观和世界观。如果没有这一条，就弄不清楚自己为谁而学习，为谁而服务。学习一切科学知识，必须在为劳动人民服务的大前提下面，才是有意义的。
    但，马列主义不是抽象的教条，学习马列主义，除了学习一般理论，还必须包括着学会马列主义与中国革命实践之统一的思想——毛泽东思想，与各种革命斗争各方面工作的结合。
    要建设新中国，不但必须恢复生产，而且必须大大的发展生产，没有这一点，革命的胜利就无法巩固。要恢复与发展生产，就要依靠现代的科学知识、生产技术与管理方法。这都是准备参加建设新社会的青年所必须学习的。要学会工厂、矿山、铁路、合作社、大企业的管理方法和生产技术；要懂得生产过程和分配过程；要懂得改良农作法，组织劳动力，把中国农业生产的水平提高一步；只有我们革命青年自己掌握了现代的生产知识和技能，并使中国的工业生产大大超过现在的水平，才能使我们的新民主主义经济大踏步地向社会主义经济迈进。
    要建设新民主主义社会，不仅要学习生产斗争的知识，还要学习阶级斗争的知识。要学会和敌人作军事的、政治的、经济的、文化的、外交的各种斗争，不但要能战胜拿枪的敌人，还要能战胜不拿枪的，隐蔽的敌人。
    青年团怎样进行学习呢？我们的学习方法，就是要把学习与斗争，学习与工作，学习与生产劳动密切地结合起来。过去有人怀疑过，说青年团基本任务在学习，青年团岂不是和一般学校没有区别了吗？还要青年团做什么？这种想法是不对的。在学校里的青年团员，当然要成为学校中的最好的学生，不但要把学校的功课学得最好，而且要在团的生活中学得好。此外，青年团员当然不限于学生。它还要在生产中、工作中、作战中和各种斗争中去学习。无论在什么地方，革命理论和革命实践的结合，都应该是青年团员在学习中的指南。
    青年团能够了解并实行这一基本任务，就能培养自己担当其建设新社会的任务，就能成为团结与教育青年一代的核心，就能成为共产党与人民民主政府在各项工作中的有力助手，和可靠的后备军。
    青年团的这一基本任务及一切工作，必须在共产党的政治领导下来进行。因为中国共产党是根据共产主义理论与中国革命实践统一的毛泽东思想领导中国革命的先进的政党。只有在党的领导下，青年团才能完成自己的基本任务。
    二、青年团的工作
    中国共产党第七届二中全会指示我们，目前中国人民的总任务，是恢复与发展工业、农业的生产事业，肃清残余的反动力量，支援解放战争前线，恢复与发展文化教育事业。二中全会指出党的工作重心，必须由乡村移到城市，而在城市斗争中，必须依靠工人阶级，青年团的方针与任务，应该服从这个总方针与总任务。应该领导青年群众积极参加上述的工作与斗争，并且把学习的任务和上述的工作与斗争密切地联系起来。
    青年团不但应在团员中与青年群众中宣传与教育马克思列宁主义，并且应在一般人民群众中进行广泛的宣传与教育。特别在新解放的城市中，应发动这个新教育的运动，说清楚劳动创造一切的道理，说清楚旧社会制度的不合理，以及旧社会的改造问题。在新解放城市的学校与工厂中，对于广大青年，必须普遍进行下列四项学习：（一）唯物史观，（二）中国革命的历史和中国革命的基本问题，（三）新民主主义革命阶段中的各种政策，（四）青年的任务、组织与青年团（在工厂中并需要学习关于工会的组织）。在工厂中进行这些学习时，应协同工会或单独组织青年训练班、座谈会等形式，在学校中应将这些学习列为课程，并在课外组织这些问题的学习活动。
    进行团的工作的根本目的，就是：在实际斗争和工作中，教育团员和青年，努力学习掌握知识，积极参加劳动，参加新民主主义各种建设事业，积极参加为实现劳动人民利益的斗争，为新民主主义的彻底胜利而斗争，使每个男女团员和青年具有革命的人生观和世界观，养成为劳动人民忠诚服务的勤务员和新社会的积极建设者。
    工厂青年团
    为了参加恢复与发展城市生产事业，为了在城市斗争中依靠工人阶级，为了增加青年团的工人阶级的基础，我们必须加强在青年工人中的工作。
    公营工厂和企业中一切工作都是围绕着生产活动而进行的，青年团必须发动青年工人与成年工人在一起，为增加产量、提高质量、减少废活、爱护机器和节省材料而努力，并遵守劳动纪律，养成正确的劳动态度。
    在有利于新民主主义国家的国民经济的私营工厂和企业中，青年团和一般职工应在劳资两利的条件下，进行生产。但必须教育与组织青年工人，和全体职工一道，为保障职工的基本权利而斗争。
    团员不但应该成为生产模范，更应该成为学习的模范。团员和团外青年工人群众，只有学习得好，才能发挥自己在生产上的积极性与创造性。青年团必须以马克思列宁主义教育自己和团外青年群众。提高自己的阶级觉悟，增强对革命的认识。懂得劳动创造一切的真理，了解自己是新民主主义国家的主人翁，自觉地为新民主主义建设事业而奋斗。要使他们认识到公营工厂和企业已经归无产阶级领导的新民主主义国家所有，是社会主义性质的经济，并使他们认识到私营工厂是私人资本主义性质，但因中国经济落后，以致在革命胜利以后，对于有利于国民经济的资本主义成分，还需在新民主主义国家经济政策与经济计划轨道内有一个发展。同时青年团员和团外青年群众，必须学习与掌握生产技术，学习文化，并组织各种研究组、讲座、夜校、读报组、问题解答等各种学习活动。
    青年团应当经常关心工人福利事业，如提倡与组织劳动互助，协助工会办好职工合作社，参加工厂行政的管理，保证人民政府法令的实现等，在不妨碍生产的条件下，应从事各种社会服务的活动（如慰劳人民解放军、支援人民解放战争前线等）及厂内的公共事务（如打扫工房、整理仓库等）。此外，必须积极组织青年及全体职工的工余娱乐、体育等活动，以活跃与调剂工人生活。
    学校青年团
    人民民主政府举办的学校，是实现新民主主义教育方针，是培养有革命思想的、有专门知识的各种建设工作的人材为目的的。学校中的青年团是为了从思想上、行动上帮助同学的进步，更好地培养为劳动人民服务，为了团结教职员与同学，完成学校新的新民主主义教育计划的实施，要使自己并推动广大同学很好地学习功课，并帮助与推动学生会组织以正课为中心的课外学习活动，青年团团员在功课上要以身作则。学校中青年团的主要工作就是学习，就是组织在教师指导下的学习互助。必须首先学好正课，同时要注意在课外在假期中参加社会服务活动与文化娱乐活动。防止死读书的偏向。使广大同学了解到学习功课是为了更好地为劳动人民服务与参加新中国建设事业。青年团团员要学习马克思列宁主义，并以马克思列宁主义理论、毛泽东思想向广大同学传播，使同学们培养成为具有革命的人生观与世界观，具有丰富的知识和技能的建设人才。
    在私立学校中，特别是教会学校中，青年团应协助政府帮助同学来争取新民主主义教育方针的实现，应帮助同学提出正确的适当的学习要求，实现同学们在学习上与生活上的基本权利。
    新解放城市的学校中，青年团应首先协助教育机关和学校行政有步骤地和有计划地开展思想改造、学习改造运动，和广大同学在一起，进行反对帝国主义与反革命特务分子的破坏活动，使得它成为实施新民主主义教育方针的人民的学校。并在这个运动中，建立与巩固新民主主义青年团。
    农村青年团
    在新解放区的农村中青年，应该首先积极参加全体农民的反奸霸与减租减息的斗争，并在斗争中团结自己，教育与组织广大青年，建立与巩固青年团。青年团在老解放区农村中的工作，应该和全体农民在一起恢复与发展农业生产，积极组织生产的、消费的、信用的、供销的合作社和各种变工互助的组织。青年团必须宣传在自愿与两利的前提下，实行组织起来的好处。提倡改进农作法，帮助改造二流子，以提高农村的生产，在目前战争时期，并需积极参加与支援解放战争。
    在农村中开展文化教育，是团的基本工作，团员自己并组织青年群众，努力学习文化，努力学习科学知识，反对迷信，宣传清洁卫生，努力学习政治，并把学习和发展生产结合起来。
    部队青年团
    人民解放军的部队中，青年占大多数，为了对他们加强教育与团结，必须建立青年团的组织，以开展青年工作。
    部队中青年团要有系统地以马列主义、毛泽东政治军事思想，教育团员与青年战士，帮助他们提高其政治认识、军事技术与文化程度，使他们成为部队一切工作和战争的突击力量。成为党与政治工作的有力助手，成为部队文化工作与活跃部队的核心。部队青年团并应帮助地方青年团与参加地方青年工作。青年团团员要使自己成为英勇果敢及熟谙军事技术的战斗英雄与执行政策、纪律的模范。
    关于部队青年团的组织与工作，将在大会后，根据朱总司令的指示，由团中央同中国人民革命军事委员会政治部共同拟定条例颁布。
    城市职业青年中的，机关中的青年团
    城市职业青年中的青年团，机关中的青年团，应使团员与青年群众将本身业务与学习结合起来，培植自己奠定革命的人生观，成为精通业务的人才。
    三、青年团的工作方式
    青年团的工作方式与团内生活，不应当依靠抽象的政治空谈，不应当依靠干燥无味的传教式的说教。青年团应当用马列主义精神，正确的分析与解决青年人切身利益有关的各项问题，如工资与健康问题、职业问题、体育与娱乐问题、学习科学与提高文化问题、学费与贷金问题、考试问题、恋爱与社交问题、家庭问题、学习方法与书籍问题、工作与学习如何配合问题等等。在分析与解决这些问题中，启发团员及广大青年能够对以上问题有正确的认识，引导他们懂得马列主义，培养他们形成马列主义的人生观与世界观，献身于全中国全人类的彻底解放的事业。
    青年团召开一切青年会议，都必须开得生动活泼。会前要有充分准备，每次会议必须有中心，有目的，每次会议要能解决问题，并使到会者受到教育。凡是不必要的，既无准备又无目的的会应当不开。东北哈尔滨市他们建立了“团日”制，规定每周或两周举行一次，在“团日”中进行专题报告、讨论、辩论、传达上级指示、布置当前工作任务、举行入团仪式、介绍团员的模范事迹、互相帮助、学习和批评、讲团课、讲故事、进行革命竞赛、歌咏、娱乐晚会等集体活动，这种简短的生动活泼的和富有教育意义的“团日”的方式，各地可以效法。总之，青年团应该创造适合青年的特点与兴趣的各种工作方式，只有这样，才能很好的团结与领导广大青年群众做好一切工作。
    四、青年团工作作风
    中国新民主主义青年团，应具有虚心学习的，实事求是的，忠诚为人民服务与英勇无畏地和敌人作顽强斗争的作风。青年团团员要在工作、斗争、生产中，研究革命理论及各种知识中，很勤劳地毫不放过一切机会地经常地虚心学习，培养自己成为新民主主义建设的各种人才。青年团团员要有马列主义的科学精神，老实的态度，从实际出发。对一切问题，先求得了解情况，占有有关的材料，再加以研究与分析，才引出正确的结论，作出正确的决定。每一个男女团员应该善于坚持真理修正错误，就是一方面毫不动摇地坚持革命的真理，而另一方面则毫不保留地以实际行动来修正自己的错误。团内要充分发挥批评与自我批评，发挥民主与严肃的作风。要提倡切实朴素，艰苦奋斗，反对形式主义与铺张浪费。青年团应注意与服从最大多数人民的最大利益，要具有集体主义精神和整体观念。要在工作中训练团员的组织性与纪律性。养成有正确的组织观念，和自觉地遵守革命秩序和纪律的良好道德与习惯。青年团必需密切联系群众，倾听人民群众与青年群众的正确的意见，只有宣传教育群众的义务，没有任何对群众强迫命令的权利。青年团员对工作要勇于负责，要富有朝气，要有积极性与创造性，在一切困难面前不低头。并且坚决克服它。对于革命事业要有无限忠心，而对于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义及一切反革命者，则彻底地毫不容情地和他们作坚决的斗争。
    这就是说，中国新民主主义青年团的团员应当是：在中国共产党的领导下，努力工作，培养出忠于劳动人民的，有知识的，勇敢坚决不怕艰难困苦的，仇恨劳动阶级敌人的，有不达目的不止的坚决精神，有无坚不摧，无攻不克的性格和品质的人物。
    青年团必须经常的注意防止骄傲与急燥作风。在目前新民主主义革命将在全国范围获得胜利时，这一点尤其重要。
    五、青年团与各方面的关系
    新民主主义青年团和共产党的关系是怎样的呢？新民主主义青年团必须坚决拥护中国共产党，完全接受中国共产党的领导。青年团是党团结与领导广大青年群众的核心，是党用马克思列宁主义教育青年的学校，是党的后备军和助手。它团结教育整个青年一代在党和人民民主政府的周围。
    新民主主义青年团是非党的群众组织，在组织上应保持自己的独立系统；但青年团内的党员必须服从党的一切决议，并以不疲倦的说服教育工作和自己的模范行动，来巩固党对青年团的领导。
    但为了使青年团能够更好的担负起团结教育青年整个一代的任务，不仅依靠团员的努力，而更重要的是依靠党的坚强领导，因此，建团的基础与骨干，必须是最优秀的党员和干部担任。各级团的工作，是必须由各级党委书记或常委亲自负责领导，并经常出席同级团的会议。青年团的工作，应列为各级党委会的重要而经常的议事日程。各级团委员会的书记，最好是同级党委的委员担任，或在党委会议时，吸收同级团委书记参加。各级团委书记副书记的调动必须经过上一级团委的批准，并向上两级团委备案。各级团委员会的选定，亦应经过上一级团委的批准。
    青年团与人民民主政府的关系是：青年团必须响应政府的号召，团员必须成为遵守政府法令的模范，但不是政府的附属组织。
    各级青年团开办团校与训练班，出版团刊与青年读物，以及团的活动与事业的经费，希望各地政府给予解决，以利青年团工作的进行和开展。
    青年团与工会的关系怎样呢？工厂里的青年团，是先进青年职工的组织，它在党的统一领导下，团结与教育全体青年职工，在青年职工中进行坚持不懈的工作，响应并执行工会一切正确的号召和决议。但工会不应干涉青年团的内部生活。也不能代替青年团的组织系统。有的同志把青年团误解成为工会的附属组织，在某种程度上限制青年团独立的活动，束缚了青年团的积极性与创造性，这是错误的。另一方面，有的同志借口青年工人的特殊性，使青年团员与整个工人运动脱节，也是错误的。作为一个工会会员的青年团团员，在一般工作问题中有服从工会决议的义务。但有关青年工人的问题，工会应当注意征求青年团方面的意见，才去作最后的决定。如工会与青年团间发生争执无法解决时，应经过党的组织或团与工会的上级来解决。各级青年团应选派最好的团员参加同级工会青工部的工作，青工部长的职位最好由青年团员来担任，并参加同级团的委员会，使工作能配合得更好。
    青年团和学校与农会、民主青年联合会、民主妇女联合会的关系怎样呢？青年团不是学校、农会、民主青年联合会、民主妇女联合会的附属组织，也不是和学校、农会、民主青联、民主妇联对立的组织。青年团在党的统一领导下，响应学校、农会、民主青联、民主妇联的号召，积极执行这些团体正确的决议。
    在被要求或被同意的时候，团的组织应派最强的干部，参加与青年有密切关系的人民教育机关、劳动保护机关、学校行政以及各种机关中去工作，以便于取得工作上的密切联系和互相配合。这对于帮助贯彻这些机关的工作，培养党的各方面的后备军，是有重要裨益的。
    派往政府、学校及其他机关团体内的干部，应实行党和青年团的决议，督促遵行政府关于保护青年利益的法令，参加该机关的一般工作，学习该机关的业务，在一定的条件下，参加该机关的领导组织，并向委派其充任代表的青年团的组织经常报告与研究工作。
    六、青年团中央的工作
    我们在这次代表大会上，将选举青年团的领导机关，团的中央委员会。团的中央成立后，将在中国共产党中央委员会直接领导之下，领导各地区的青年团与青年工作。团的中央要善于总结青年工作的经验教训，以马列主义观点与中国青年工作实践结合起来，加以概括形成有系统的经验，再用以指导全国青年运动。要善于帮助各级青年团学会总结工作。
    团的中央将经过一个短时期的筹备，出版团中央的报纸。在现在，以中国共产党中央青年工作委员会所办的“中国青年”刊物为自己的机关刊物，以这个刊物组织广大青年学习，并指导青年团工作。必须做到系统地以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教育团员与团外青年群众，要使团员与团外青年群众，经过这个刊物解决他们最关心的切身的问题。各级团委应该十分重视这个刊物，并发动团员及广大青年给他投稿，提供意见，组织通讯与推销发行。要使这个刊物不仅起宣传教育作用，还要起团的组织作用。
    团中央除了出版“中国青年”外，应有计划有系统地编辑团员课本，编辑通俗的青年读物，出版教育广大青年的丛书。并协助各地团的组织举办讲座、演讲、座谈等各种文化活动，以宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想。
    团的中央将以中国共产党中央青年工作委员会所举办的新民主主义青年团团校，为中央团校，在这学校里应不断地训练大批青年干部，使他们毕业后到各地区担任团的工作。团校的课程，为马列主义、新民主主义、党的政策、团的建设、青年工作。因为南方不久即将解放，团校应即培养一批南下建团干部。同样地各地区应开设团校或训练班，训练干部。
    团的中央将加强领导青年艺术剧院，使这个剧院的人员学习马列主义艺术理论，以艺术形式宣传党的政策，同时经过这一剧院，来研究与指导各级青年团的文化娱乐艺术宣传工作。
    目前青年团的工作重心在城市，团的中央应加强领导城市青年工作，特别是工厂和学校里的青年工作。在青年团尚未建立的工厂和学校中，要有酝酿地有步骤地建团。但同时应兼顾农村，决不能丢掉农村。要有重点地在尚未建团的地方建团，在已经普遍建团的农村中，要有重点地加强领导。团在部队的野战军中，要有重点的试办。在后方的部队中和军事机关中，应普遍地开始建团工作。对于少年儿童工作，青年团应派优秀的干部领导。
    团的中央应引导中国广大青年群众参加国际青年的反帝国主义的民主和平运动，加强与东方各国民主青年运动的联系。团的中央应引导中国广大青年群众和中国人民在一起，拥护并参加以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，反对以美国帝国主义为首的阴谋准备与挑动战争的国际侵略阵营，为全世界持久和平与人民民主、为全人类彻底解放而奋斗。
    同志们！我们中国青年多年来所努力奋斗的目标：推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治——即将实现了，新的更艰巨的任务——建设新民主主义国家的任务，摆在我们的面前。我们坚信：经历过伟大斗争的中国青年，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，一定能够担负起共产党与人民所给予我们的历史任务。新民主主义青年团的全体同志们，同全国青年和全国人民一道，坚决地为建设一个新民主主义国家而共同奋斗吧！        （新华社）
