　　Wangjiaping's Prosperity Through Mutual Aid Production
    Wangjiaping Village in Suide County was recently recognized at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's financial and economic conference as a model for how liberated peasants in the Border Region can develop production. Its first notable feature is that despite suffering severe devastation from Hu Zongnan's bandit troops and significant natural disasters, through efforts in 1948, production has now recovered to the level of 1946. The year 1949 is expected to be a year of prosperity for the village's production, which is a significant achievement in the rural areas of northern Shaanxi. Its second characteristic is that the village's labor exchange and mutual aid organizations have remained intact for five years. They have evolved from simple, temporary labor exchanges to regular labor mutual aid, gradually transforming the scattered small-scale peasant economy into an organized and planned system. This has improved labor efficiency, increased production, and raised farmers' incomes.
    Wangjiaping was liberated in 1940. By 1944, it had been selected as a model village for the entire county. It continued to develop and prosper, and by 1946, the village's livestock had increased from a few to thirteen, and each hectare of land yielded one additional *dou* of grain compared to similar land in other villages. In 1947, due to the devastation caused by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops and natural disasters, livestock decreased by more than half, and crop yields fell by 30%, resulting in a very serious situation. However, the village's farmers persisted in timely cultivation even during Hu's bandit incursions in 1947, and they worked even harder after Hu's bandits were repelled in 1948, quickly recovering to pre-war levels. The specific details of Wangjiaping's production recovery are as follows: In 1946, the village had a total of thirteen livestock, which decreased to seven in 1947 but recovered to thirteen in 1948; in 1946, the village cultivated 495 *qing* (each *qing* is three *mu*), 512 *qing* in 1947, and 554 *qing* in 1948; the average yield per *qing* was six *dou* of coarse grain in 1946, which decreased to four *dou* in 1947 but recovered to six *dou* in 1948; in 1946, the average yield of fine grain per person in the village was nine *dou*, which decreased to five *dou* and two *sheng* in 1947 but increased to nine *dou* and two *sheng* in 1948. From these statistics, it can be seen that the loss of draft animals and the decline in production were significant in Wangjiaping during the bandit-stricken year of 1947, but by 1948, the number of cultivated *mu* and the average income per person had both slightly increased compared to the pre-war level. The winter production plan set by Wangjiaping last October has also been completed. In addition to harrowing, terracing, digging water cellars, and composting, each labor team has also built a road and completed the tree planting plan. Now that Wangjiaping's cultivated land area has reached saturation, this year's plan is to shift more of the surplus labor into sideline production. According to this year's plan, in addition to cultivation, each household will plant one *mu* of potatoes and three ridges of early melons and summer vegetables to prevent famine. Each household will plant three ridges of sugar beets, and it is estimated that each household can purchase an average of three *dou* of millet. The entire village will buy fifteen piglets in the spring, which can be exchanged for sixty or seventy sheep in the fall and produce eight or nine hundred bags of manure.
    The farmers of Wangjiaping were very poor before liberation in 1940. At that time, the entire village cultivated more than 400 *qing* of land, but more than 300 *qing* were rented from landlords. Rents were heavy, and coupled with the Kuomintang government's exorbitant taxes, many farmers were in debt. Some resorted to stealing and gambling due to the pressure of life; many were instigated by landlords, constantly engaging in open and covert struggles to compete for land, and the village had a very bad reputation. After the establishment of the people's government in 1940, through the struggles of rent reduction and interest rate reduction, the peasants recovered most of the land, and their enthusiasm for production was high. A great production movement was launched, changing all the past habits of idleness and disunity, and the entire village took on a new look. In 1943, farmers realized the benefits of mutual aid labor by collectively cultivating public fields and establishing public granaries, and then established labor exchange teams. The labor exchange teams implemented voluntary association, equivalent exchange of labor, and democratic and unified leadership. By 1946, more than 95% of the village's labor and livestock had participated in labor exchange and mutual aid. Under labor exchange and mutual aid, farmers generally improved farming methods. All crops were planted on time, and major crops such as millet, sorghum, and black beans were hoed four times. Methods to conserve water and soil and improve soil quality, such as terracing, embankment reinforcement, and digging water cellars, were adopted in all possible areas. In 1946, Wangjiaping's average yield per *qing* was one *dou* more than that of similar land in other villages. In addition to the labor exchange teams, women voluntarily raised funds with jewelry and silverware to establish a consumer cooperative, which provided women with daily necessities such as needles and threads at low prices. The public granary was used to hold public welfare activities and assist production. For example, the village specially hired teachers to organize literacy classes, using noon and evening to teach literacy, read newspapers, and explain current affairs, improving the cultural level of the peasants. Peasants generally swept their yards once a day and washed their water tanks every five days. In 1946, the public granary purchased jujube tree seedlings and distributed them to everyone to plant, and it provided loans to labor exchange teams to transport salt. Farmers could consult with the public granary to solve any production difficulties. Thanks to the above work foundation, although Wangjiaping suffered severe disasters, especially the ravages of Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, it recovered very quickly.
    Wangjiaping's production work has been able to maintain its model status due to the strong leadership of the village's Communist Party members and village cadres. During the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement, Wangjiaping, under the cultivation of the Communist Party, produced activists such as Wang Debiao, Wang Yingcheng, and Wang Zhou, who became the leading core of the entire village. Wang Debiao and others have always actively served the masses of the entire village, earning the trust of the masses and leading them forward. They conscientiously implement the mass line, and for many important matters, they first propose their own ideas and methods based on the interests of the entire village, then explain and deliberate them among the masses, collect everyone's opinions, and finally convene a village congress to formally discuss them. Once a decision is made, they lead everyone to insist on implementing it. For example, the establishment of the public granary was proposed by the village cadres based on the needs of the people in the village. Later, the idea of ​​collective labor exchange and mutual aid was generated in the collective cultivation of public fields, and after more than 20 days of deliberation, the organization of the labor exchange team was established. For another example, the cooperative was established according to the requirements of women, and it had a mass base from the beginning. The things they proposed and decided by the village congress are generally possible to achieve, not empty talk. In the implementation process, they can distinguish between priorities and urgencies, carry out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and check in a timely manner, gradually correcting shortcomings. This democratic leadership method has been supported by the villagers and has naturally become a system that is used more skillfully. Each meeting generally discusses two issues and checks the work decided last time. Because there has been prior deliberation, the discussion does not take much time. In addition, the Communist Party and the government constantly encourage and educate the model figures in this village, improve their level of awareness, and ensure that they maintain regular contact with the masses, which is also one of the reasons.
    Wangjiaping Village also has some shortcomings, such as inaccurate calculation in some labor exchanges, the cooperative not yet being combined with production and marketing, some cadres not having a good enough attitude towards the masses, and the village not paying enough attention to overcoming superstition, buying and selling marriages, and early marriage. In particular, the local superior government has not well summarized Wangjiaping's experience, helped them improve, and promoted it to the surrounding areas.

### 由互助生产走向繁荣的王家坪

　　由互助生产走向繁荣的王家坪
　　由互助生产走向繁荣的王家坪
    绥德县王家坪村在最近陕甘宁边区政府的财经会议上，被认为是边区翻身农民发展生产的一个方向。它的第一个特点，是虽然遭受胡宗南匪军的严重蹂躏和天灾的重大损害，但经一九四八年的努力，现在生产已恢复到一九四六年的水平。而一九四九年则是该村生产繁荣的一年。这在陕北农村不能不说是一件大事。它的第二个特点，是该村变工互助组织五年来一直没有垮台，由当初简单的临时的变工，发展到经常的劳动互助，使散漫的小农经济逐渐走向有组织，有计划，发挥了劳动效率，提高了生产，增加了农民收入。
    王家坪是一九四○年解放的。一九四四年就被全县选为模范村。是后日益发展和繁荣，到一九四六年，该村牲畜已由几头增加到十三头，每垧土地比其他村庄同等土地多收一斗。一九四七年，由于胡宗南匪军的摧残和天灾为害，牲畜减少一半以上，农产歉收百分之三十，造成很严重的状况。但该村农民即在一九四七年胡匪骚扰时仍坚持及时耕作，而在一九四八年胡匪被击退后更努力生产，所以很快就恢复到战前水平。王家坪生产恢复的具体情形是这样：在一九四六年，全村有牲口十三头，一九四七年降为七头，一九四八年恢复到十三头；一九四六年全村种地四九五垧（每垧三亩），一九四七年是五一二垧，一九四八年增加为五五四垧；一九四六年每垧平均产量是粗粮六斗，一九四七年降为四斗，一九四八年恢复为六斗；一九四六年全村每人平均收细粮九斗，一九四七年降为五斗二升，一九四八年增加为九斗二升。从这个统计可以看到，王家坪在一九四七年匪灾年份，畜力的损失和生产的降落是很大的，但到一九四八年，该村种地亩数和每人平均收入却已都较战前稍稍提高了。去年十月王家坪订的冬季生产计划也已完成，除耙地、溜崖、挖水窖、沤粪等外每个劳力组并修了一条路完成了栽树的计划。现在因为王家坪耕地面积已到达饱和点，因此，今年的计划是更多的把剩余劳力转入副业生产。按今年的计划，除耕种外，为了防荒，每户要种一亩洋芋，三畦早瓜、夏菜。每户要种三畦糖萝卜，预计每户平均可购小米三斗。全村春季买小猪十五口，秋后可换羊六、七十只，并可踩粪八九百袋。
    王家坪的农民在一九四○年解放前，原是十分贫困的，那时全村共种地四百多垧，但有三百多垧是农民向地主租种的。租子很重，加上国民党政府的苛捐杂税，许多农民欠债。有的因生活逼迫就偷盗，赌博；许多人受地主的挑拨，为争租土地而经常明争暗斗，村子的名声很坏。一九四○年人民政权建立后，经过了减租减息斗争，农民收回了大部土地，生产情绪很高，展开了大生产运动，改变了过去一切游惰习气和不团结现象，全村焕然一新。在一九四三年，农民即因集体耕种义田，建立义仓，体会到了互助劳动的好处，于是建立起变工队来。变工队执行了自愿结合，等价换工和民主统一的领导，到一九四六年以后，全村百分之九十五以上的劳力畜力就都参加了变工互助。在变工互助下，农民们普遍提高农作法，一切庄稼按时种植，主要作物如谷子、高粱、黑豆等都锄了四遍，溜崖、拍畔、打水窖等保持水土和改良土质的办法在一切可能实行的地里都采用了。在一九四六年，王家坪的每垧土地平均较其他村的同等土地多收了一斗。除变工队外，妇女们自动以首饰、银器集资办了一个消费合作社，合作社低价供给妇女们针线等日用品。义仓则被用作举办公益事业和扶助生产。如村里专门聘请教员，组织了识字班，利用中午和晚上教识字，读报和讲解时事，提高了农民的文化水平，农民普遍地做到每天扫一次院，五天刷洗一次水缸。在一九四六年。义仓曾购买了枣树苗分给大家种，贷款给变工队运盐。一九四八年为了救济春荒，义仓贷给每个纺妇二斤棉花。凡农民生产有困难，都可向义仓商量解决。由于上面这些工作基础，虽然王家坪遭受了严重的灾荒，特别是胡宗南匪军的蹂躏，但很迅速地恢复了起来。
    王家坪的生产工作所以能始终保持模范，与村内共产党员和村干部的坚强领导是分不开的。在减租减息运动中，王家坪就在共产党的培养下，出现了王德彪、王应成、王周等积极分子，成为全村人民的领导核心。在一九四四年，王德彪当选为陕甘宁边区的特等劳动英雄。王德彪等始终积极地为全村群众办事，得到群众的信仰，带领着群众前进。他们认真地执行群众路线，对于许多重要事情，都是首先根据全村人民的利益，提出自己的主张和办法，然后分头在群众中解释和酝酿，收集大家意见，最后开村民大会，正式讨论，一经决定，就领导大家坚持执行。比如，义仓的举办，是村干部根据村里人民公共利益的需要提出，以后在集体耕种义田中，产生了集体劳动变工互助的思想，经过二十多天的酝酿，建立起变工队的组织。又如，合作社则是根据妇女的要求成立的，一开始就有群众基础。他们所提出并经村民大会决定的事情，一般都是可能实现的，而不是空谈。在执行中，他们能分清轻重缓急，有计划地和有步骤地进行，并适时检查，逐渐改正缺点，这种民主的领导方法，得到村民的拥护，很自然地成为一种制度，并运用得比较熟练。每次会议一般地讨论两个问题，检查上次决定的工作，因为事先有过酝酿，因此讨论并不费时间。此外，共产党和政府对这个村子的模范人物，不断地进行鼓励和教育，提高他们的觉悟程度，使他们经常和群众保持联系，也是原因之一。
    王家坪庄还存在一些缺点，如变工中有些折算不精确，合作社还没有和生产供销结合起来，少数干部对群众态度不够好，村里对克服迷信、买卖婚姻、早婚等也注意不够；特别是当地上级政府未很好总结王家坪的经验，帮助他们提高，并向四周推广。
