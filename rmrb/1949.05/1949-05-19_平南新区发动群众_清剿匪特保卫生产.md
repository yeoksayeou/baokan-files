[Jizhong News] The Pingnan New District has achieved initial success in its continuous suppression of remnant bandits and enemy special agents. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, some remnant bandits and special agents often gathered in groups of three to five in the junction areas of counties and in reed fields and woodlands to carry out harassment activities. A total of 54 of our troops, local cadres, and the masses were killed. In order to thoroughly eliminate the remnant bandits and special agents, stabilize social order, and protect the production of the masses, the Jizhong Tenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically convened a joint meeting of the armed forces ministers and public security bureau chiefs of the counties and the county battalion commanders from April 5th to 7th to deploy the suppression work before the green crops grew tall enough to hide people. Under the unified leadership of the Party, relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, carry out reconnaissance and investigation work, and suppress the enemy with focus and objectives. The new liberated areas should focus on suppression, while the old and semi-old areas should focus on strengthening public security work. When carrying out the suppression work, the district and county established suppression committees and organized suppression headquarters, and villages set up public security teams. The garrison troops in various places will assist in order to quickly and thoroughly eliminate the remnant bandits. At the same time, we should expand the publicity of our Party's lenient policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." The arrest and execution of criminals must be carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures, and indiscriminate arrests and killings are not allowed. We must also strengthen the armed forces at all levels, develop and consolidate the militia, and strictly manage the registration of firearms. It was also pointed out that we must seize the opportunity, rely on the masses to carry out the work, strictly prevent the deviation of purely military "suppression," and quickly eliminate all remnant bandits and special agents who dare to continue to do evil.
