    How Locomotive C-105 Was Completed on Schedule
    Chi
    The workers of the Locomotive Yard of the Mechanical Repair Factory at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, working day and night to repair Locomotive C-105 in preparation for "May Day," have completed it on schedule. It was test-run on the 30th of last month and named "Heroic" to commemorate the heroic behavior of the working class in production.
    Locomotive C-105 was an old engine over forty-two years old. After liberation, in order to restore production, the Iron and Steel Plant planned to send it to Changxindian for major repairs. Because the Iron and Steel Plant had never repaired locomotives before, the tools and materials were not complete. However, the workers recognized that the factory was their own, and that repairing it ahead of schedule would assist production, so they bravely proposed to repair it themselves. At that time, the administrative负责人 (person in charge) of the department did not believe in the strength of the workers and rejected their request. On the night of March 17, the workers braved a sandstorm to see the military representative and requested that C-105 be left for them to repair, and stated that they could collect the materials themselves and borrow the tools from elsewhere. The military representative approved this request. The workers were very excited and went back to assign work according to their specialties, and then went out to borrow tools. Hu Wenqi ran to Changxindian to borrow screw taps and tube expanders, Wang Qinghua borrowed a flat plate from the Shijingshan Power Plant, and Li Shuanglin discussed it with worker He Haifu at the Mechanical Shop and installed a lathe for turning the large shaft. When unloading the boiler, since there was no large crane, they used a small crane to lift one end, padded it with sleepers and iron pipes, and pushed it manually. When repairing the frame, since there were no tools to disassemble it, they used fire and manpower to strike it. Fearing that the iron plate would soften and bend, they anxiously guarded the frame, even daring not go home to eat. In the last week, in order to ensure the locomotive was ready by "May Day," they voluntarily worked overtime until 11 p.m., averaging fourteen hours of work per day.
    To repair Locomotive C-105, it was not only necessary to overcome difficulties in tools, materials, and technology, but also to go through internal ideological struggles. At the beginning, some staff also emphasized the difficulties, dared not take responsibility, and did not actively help, but the workers still humbly consulted with them in everything, and finally made the staff change their old style and views, and realized that the workers' enthusiasm for building their own factory was correct, so they also consulted with the workers in everything. Among the workers repairing the locomotive, there were initially some small contradictions: although the activists who advocated repairing the locomotive were more conscious and played a leading role in their work, they only focused on their own work, regardless of everyone else, which made some workers feel indifferent and unmotivated. Later, the activists held a self-criticism meeting, recognizing that it was impossible to be separated from the masses, and that the saying "Old cow, broken cart, don't block the road, just leave it aside and let us pass" was completely wrong. At this meeting, the comrades of the work team also made self-criticism, because in the past they had also been only focusing on the activists and not taking care of the overall situation. After everyone's self-criticism, the whole team sincerely united, and the "Heroic" locomotive was completed on schedule.

    Ｃ一○五号机车怎样如期修成的
    炽
    石景山钢铁厂机械修理厂机车场工友们为了迎接“五一”，日夜赶修Ｃ一○五号机车，已如期完成。于上月三十日出厂试车，为了纪念工人阶级在生产中的英勇行为取名为“英勇”号。
    Ｃ一○五号机车是一辆年逾四十二岁的老车头。解放后钢铁厂为了恢复生产，预备把它送到长辛店去大修。因为钢铁厂从来没有修过车头，工具材料都不全。可是工人们认识到工厂是自己的，提前修好就能配合生产，因此，勇敢的提出自己修理。当时该部们行政负责人不相信工人的力量，拒绝了工友的要求。工友在三月十七日深夜，冒着大风沙去见军事代表，请求把Ｃ一○五号留下来给他们修理，并表示材料可以自己去搜集，工具也可以到别处去借。军事代表批准了这要求。工友们很兴奋回去就按各人擅长分配了工作，接着分头出外借工具。胡文歧跑到长辛店去借螺丝锥子和涨管器，王庆华到石景山发电厂借平板，李双林到机械场和工友何海福一商量，按上了旋大轴的车床。在卸锅炉的时候没有大吊车，就用小吊车吊起一头，垫上道木和铁管，用人力推。在修理车架的时候没有工具来拆卸，就使火烧，用人力打。为了怕铁板烧软了弯下来，他们提心吊胆地守在车架旁边，甚至连饭也不敢回去吃。在最后的一个星期里，为了保证“五一”出车，自动加夜班作到夜十一点钟，每天平均工作十四小时。
    为修理Ｃ一○五号机车，不仅须克服工具、材料及技术上的困难，还经过了内部思想的斗争。一开始时有的职员也强调困难，不敢负责，不积极帮助，但工人们仍事事虚心和他们商量，终使职员改变了旧的作风和看法，认识到如今工人们对自己工厂的热心建设是正确的，也就事事跟工人商量起来。在修车的工友之间，起初也有一些小矛盾：主张修车的积极分子虽然觉悟较高，在工作积极起带头作用，但在工作时光顾自己作，不管大家，使一部分工友感到冷淡，干得不起劲。后来积极分子开了一次检讨会，认清了脱离群众不行，看到别人不积极，所谓“老牛破车别挡路，干脆撩在一边，让咱们过去”的说法是完全错误的。在这个会上，工作团同志也作了自我检讨，因为过去他们也是一头钻在积极分子圈子里，不照顾全面。经过大家检讨，全体真心团结起来，“英勇”号机车便如期完成了。
