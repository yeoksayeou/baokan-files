    The May Fourth Movement and the Road of Intellectuals
    Chen Boda
    (I)
    Thirty years have passed since the May Fourth Movement. These are thirty years of earth-shattering changes for the Chinese people.
    The greatest achievement of the May Fourth Movement was the combination of intellectuals and the workers' movement, which led to the emergence of the Chinese proletarian party—the Chinese Communist Party, with Comrade Mao Zedong as its great representative—and the integration of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, as represented by Mao Zedong Thought. This is the pivotal point of great changes in Chinese history. This is the pivot by which the Chinese people, after thousands of years of being ruled, have gradually and completely gained the ruling position after thirty years of struggle. The Chinese people's victory of New Democracy, which is shaking the world today, started precisely from here.
    Before the May Fourth Movement, during the era of the old democratic revolution as Comrade Mao Zedong called it, many moving people’s movements and people’s heroes also emerged in China. The Ping Ying Tuan movement in the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the Reform Movement of 1898, the Boxer Rebellion, the Xinhai Revolution, and many leaders in these movements, all guided the advancement of modern Chinese history to a certain extent and advocated the awakening of the people. However, lacking the modern workers' movement as the vanguard of all the people, and the intellectuals who came from the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, whether it was Tan Sitong, who declared during the Reform Movement of 1898 that reform must involve bloodshed, or the many heroes who threw bombs at reactionary bureaucrats and warlords on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution, they could not deeply integrate with the masses or accurately understand the interests of the people. This showed great limitations and narrowness in the movements and leaders. Therefore, it was impossible for the Chinese people to finally defeat the enemy and transform themselves into masters of China within such a historical circle.
    The May Fourth Movement changed this old historical situation. In the world, the great Russian October Socialist Revolution had already occurred. In China, the working class stepped onto the historical stage of political contest. After this, the intellectuals from the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie began to split greatly. The right wing, represented by people like Hu Shi, quickly turned to the side of counter-revolution in the process of the May Fourth Movement, defended the reactionaries and imperialists, openly claiming that the fact pointed out by the Communists that imperialism dominated China was nothing but "a strange tale from overseas," and put forward "talk more about problems, talk less about isms" to counter the socialist and communist trends of thought at the time. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Most of them compromised with the enemy and stood on the side of reaction." (On New Democracy) On the other hand, the left wing, represented by Comrades Mao Zedong and Li Dazhao, raised high the banner of revolutionary science—Marxism-Leninism, called on the people to revolt to overthrow imperialism and feudalism and prepare for a socialist future, and threw themselves into the actual workers' movement. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party was established, and a group of heroic figures, as firm as steel and daring, who were with the people, were trained.
    This new era of China is the era of the New Democratic Revolution as Comrade Mao Zedong said. The basic characteristic of this New Democratic Revolution that distinguishes it from the Old Democratic Revolution is the revolution of the masses of the people led by the proletariat. In the era of the Old Democratic Revolution in China, the revolution lacked clear goals and correct paths among the people. The bourgeoisie feared the masses of the people and was limited by the historical narrowness of its own class. Therefore, even the best revolutionaries from the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie could not point out the laws of Chinese social history and the laws of revolution. Only the leadership of the proletariat can break the limitations and narrowness of past revolutions, and understand and base itself on the laws of Chinese social history and the laws of revolution, providing complete hope and concrete paths for China's new birth. This proletarian leadership is concentratedly manifested in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leadership of Marxism-Leninism, and the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and the formation of Marxism-Leninism in China were premised on the combination of Chinese revolutionary intellectuals and the workers' movement.
    The emergence of Marxism-Leninism—the communist worldview and theory of social revolution—in China, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, caused a great revolution in the ideological field in China, becoming the precursor to the great Chinese revolution. This great ideological revolution represents the consciousness of the working class, and is the revolution of the ideology of the working class against the ideology of the landlord bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie; however, the working class began to acquire this scientific socialist—communist consciousness, with the help of those revolutionary intellectuals who went to the working class and combined with the working class, and the influence and results of those intellectuals who first accepted Marxism-Leninism in spreading this doctrine among the working class, and Comrade Mao Zedong was the most outstanding and greatest figure among such a group of revolutionary intellectuals.
    The combination of intellectuals and the workers' movement, and then proceeding from this, combining with the peasant movement in the capacity of representatives of the working class, thus helped the Chinese peasant movement break away from the primitive patriarchal form of movement, and appear in a brand-new form of movement under the leadership of the proletariat.
    The combination of intellectuals and the working class, and also with the peasant masses, at the same time enabled the intellectuals themselves to obtain strength they had never obtained in any previous era, transformed themselves, and showed great wisdom. In the long, cruel, and tortuous revolutionary struggle, although some people could not withstand the test of history and carried out despicable and vile betrayals, such as Chen Duxiu, who was famous for editing the "New Youth" magazine during the May Fourth Movement, developed a capitulationist line towards the bourgeoisie in 1927, and after the Kuomintang reactionaries such as Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei bloodbathed the revolution, betrayed the revolutionary camp and became a counter-revolutionary Trotskyite, serving as a running dog of fascism. Another example is Zhang Guotao, who had mixed in the revolutionary ranks for some days, and at another historical juncture, actually entered the Kuomintang's secret service group to carry out despicable counter-revolutionary work. So on and so forth. In addition, there were also some intellectuals who wavered during difficult days, broke away from the people, took a big detour, could not find a way to go, and then returned to the people's side. However, the majority of revolutionary intellectuals were able to withstand the test. Under extremely difficult struggle conditions, they followed Comrade Mao Zedong to advance, adhered to the banner of the people, held the determination to defeat the enemy, and did not care about their own lives. Their struggle became an important and inseparable part of the entire people's victorious cause. At the same time, many democratic intellectuals persisted in supporting the people's just cause for a long time, and likewise left great glory in history.
    The price paid by many revolutionary intellectuals over the past thirty years, who exhausted their efforts and sacrificed their lives, is unprecedented in Chinese history. It can be said without exaggeration that their achievements in the past thirty years, in terms of helping the people's revolution to victory, surpassed the achievements of the Chinese intellectual community over the past thousands of years.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said on the twentieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement: "If intellectuals do not integrate with the workers, peasants, and masses, they will accomplish nothing." "The final demarcation between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and put into practice the integration with the workers, peasants, and masses. Their final demarcation lies solely in this point." The history of the past thirty years has fully proved this only correct conclusion of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Comrade Mao Zedong also said to our party comrades elsewhere: "The party should protect revolutionary intellectuals. Without revolutionary intellectuals, the revolution cannot be victorious." "It is necessary to attract and accept a large number of revolutionary intellectuals. It is necessary to persuade worker-peasant cadres to be able to eat, not to be afraid of them; workers and peasants will not improve themselves without the help of revolutionary intellectuals; without intellectuals, work cannot govern the country, the party, or the army." The history of the past thirty years has also fully proved this correct conclusion of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    (II)
    We are now facing a new historical stage. That is to say, a stage of destroying the old China is about to pass quickly, and a stage of building a new China is coming. Comrade Mao Zedong has put forward a new historical task for us, which is: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." This new historical stage has opened up a broader path for all intellectuals in the country who are willing and able to serve the people. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Seizing victory across the country is only the first step in a ten-thousand-mile long march. If this step is also worth being proud of, it is relatively small, and what is more worthy of pride is yet to come." "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous." Therefore, intellectuals who have already participated in the revolution must not be complacent about their past work, but need to assume greater responsibilities in the cause of building a new China, and implement Comrade Mao Zedong's admonition to all our party comrades: "Continue to maintain the style of being humble, cautious, not arrogant, and not impetuous," "Continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," "Learn what we didn't understand before," and avoid becoming a backward person in the new historical stage. At the same time, the victory of our people's revolution and the prospects for building a new China have given all the intellectuals in the country who have not participated in the revolutionary ranks in the past an unprecedented opportunity to serve the people and transform themselves. Although many people did not combine with the workers and peasants, and did not participate in the revolutionary work of the past historical stage, everyone can and must combine with the workers and peasants and participate in the work of a new historical stage, that is, building a new China. It is not too late for everyone to participate in the upcoming productive revolution to prepare to turn an agricultural country into an industrial country, and to participate in the upcoming cultural revolution to prepare to turn cultural backwardness into cultural advancement. Everyone must know that without the victory of the people's revolution today, it would be completely impossible to realize this industrial production revolution and the cultural revolution to universally enlighten the people in China. In April 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong's "On the United Government" made the following historical summary of this issue:
    "In a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, divided China, wanting to develop industry, build national defense, benefit the people, and bring about the country's prosperity and strength, how many people have dreamed such dreams for many years, but they have all been shattered. Many well-meaning educators, scientists, and students do not ask about politics, and think that they can serve the country with what they have learned, but the results have also turned into dreams, and all have been shattered. This is good news. The shattering of this naive dream is precisely the starting point for China's prosperity and strength. The Chinese people have learned many things in the Anti-Japanese War, and know that after the Japanese aggressors are eliminated, it is necessary to establish a new democratic, independent, free, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong China, and these conditions are mutually related and indispensable. If this is the case, China will have hope. Releasing the productive forces of the Chinese people and enabling them to obtain the possibility of full development depends on the realization of new democratic political conditions throughout China."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's words, after four full years, the new democratic political conditions throughout China are about to be fully realized soon. This means that all the intellectuals in the country who hope that their motherland will have a great future have now completely obtained their own "place to display their talents." Everyone is re-combining with the workers and peasants, re-combining with all the people, to build a great new China—this new historical mission is facing all the intellectuals in the country.
    (III)
    However, Marx said it well: "Educators must first be educated." If intellectuals across the country want to serve the people, they must acquire the consciousness of serving the people and continue to receive education in practical work. Comrade Mao Zedong has said in his work "On the United Government" that the task of the Chinese Communist Party in reforming the old intellectuals "is to adopt appropriate methods to educate them, so that they can acquire new viewpoints and new methods to serve the Chinese people."
    In the previous historical stage, the great revolution caused by the worker-peasant movement and Marxism-Leninism in the ideological field in China promoted many revolutionary intellectuals to successively enter the ranks of serving the people; in the new historical stage in the future, the people urgently need more and more useful intellectuals, and because the victory of the People's Liberation Army is promoting an unprecedented new upsurge of the national intellectual community serving the people; along with this new upsurge, it is also necessary for the old intellectual community to have another great ideological revolution on the worldview and outlook on life. Intellectuals must, based on the actual experience of the Chinese people's revolution over the past hundred years—especially the past thirty years, use the new viewpoints and new methods of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, use the new viewpoints and new methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, in all academic departments (whether philosophical, economic, political, historical, literary, and various natural sciences), to "re-evaluate all values" for themselves, and conduct criticism and self-criticism.
    Around the May Fourth Movement, some bourgeois scholars in China introduced some reactionary philosophical schools of the Western bourgeoisie, such as Hu Shi transporting the so-called "pragmatism" of American bourgeois kept philosophers and the so-called "Bergson philosophy," "neo-Kantianism," "neo-Hegelianism," "Machism," etc. introduced by Zhang Junmai or others. These reactionary mystical idealistic Western bourgeois philosophical schools once used China's cultural backwardness and muddled through some days to counter dialectical materialism and historical materialism. They used these reactionary viewpoints and reactionary methods and were never able to explain Chinese history, modern society, and cultural issues. The most reactionary elements among them, such as Hu Shi and Zhang Junmai, could only defend the reactionaries and imperialists. Now things are very clear: all these reactionary philosophical schools have completely gone bankrupt in front of the Chinese people. After thirty years of struggle and victory of the Chinese people, Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism have been even more proven to be irresistible truths, and whoever does not want to fall behind must seriously learn it. This viewpoint and method of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, this viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, is not something mysterious at all, and can be completely learned, as long as he is willing to combine with the worker-peasant masses, as long as he has the enthusiasm to serve the people, as long as he does not insist on past wrong prejudices, as long as a person has the courage to challenge himself for the sake of the truth and dare to deny past wrong viewpoints.
    Commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, we call on the old intellectual community across the country to accept the glorious traditions of revolutionary intellectuals over the past thirty years, conduct such an ideological revolution, and re-arm their minds with the worldview and outlook on life of the working class. After such an ideological revolution, and after new tests in practice, the old intellectual community can also become the new intellectual community of the people, and when they can proceed from the working class, proceed from the people, to obtain the new viewpoints and new methods of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, their useful knowledge can emit great brilliance among the people, and in the process of serving the people, they can truly effectively and further obtain great results.

    五四运动与知识分子的道路
    陈伯达
    （一）
    五四运动已经经过了三十年。这是中国人民翻天覆地的三十年。
    五四运动最伟大的成果，是知识分子与工人运动的结合，由此就出现了以毛泽东同志为伟大代表的中国无产阶级正党——中国共产党，由此就出现了以毛泽东思想为集中代表的马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合。这是中国有史以来大变化的枢纽。这是中国人民由数千年被统治地位、而经过三十年的奋斗、逐步与完全取得统治地位的枢纽。中国人民今天震撼全世界的新民主主义的胜利，正是从此出发的。
    在五四运动以前，即毛泽东同志所说的旧民主主义革命时代，中国也出现了许多可歌可泣的人民运动，人民英雄。鸦片战争中的平英团运动，太平天国运动，戊戍变法运动，义和团运动，辛亥革命运动，以及这些运动中许多领导者，都在一定程度上引导了近代中国历史的前进，鼓吹了人民的觉醒，但是缺乏了近代的工人运动为全体人民的前驱，而从贵族中与资产阶级中出来的知识分子，不论是在戊戍变法时宣称变法必须流血的谭嗣同，不论是辛亥革命前夜许多向反动官僚军阀抛炸弹的好汉，他们也不能与民众深相结合，不能确切领会人民的利益。这样就显出运动与领导人物很大的限制性与狭隘性，中国人民因此就不可能在这样的历史圈内最后战胜敌人并把自己变成中国的主人翁。
    五四运动变更了这种旧历史的情况。在世界上那时已出现了伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命，而在中国则出现了工人阶级登上政治角逐的历史舞台，在这以后，资产阶级或小资产阶级出身的知识界开始了极大的分裂。以胡适这一类人为代表的右翼，在五四运动的过程中很快地转到反革命的方面，为反动派与帝国主义辩护，公开认为共产党人所指出的帝国主义支配中国的事实不过是“海外奇谈”，并提出了“多谈问题，少谈主义”，以对抗当时社会主义共产主义的思潮。这就是毛泽东同志所说的：“他们中间的大部分就与敌人妥协，站在反动方面了”（新民主主义论）。另方面，以毛泽东、李大钊等同志为代表的左翼，则高举革命科学——马克思列宁主义的大旗，号召人民革命，以推翻帝国主义与封建制度及准备社会主义的将来，并投身于实际的工人运动中，结果就成立了中国共产党，并锻炼出了一批又一批的与人民在一起的钢铁般与胆大包天的英雄人物。
    这个中国新时代，就是毛泽东同志所说的新民主主义革命时代。这个新民主主义革命区别于旧民主主义革命的基本特点，就是以无产阶级为领导的人民大众的革命。在中国旧民主主义革命时代，革命在人民中是缺乏明确的目标与正确的道路的。资产阶级害怕人民大众，并为自己阶级的历史狭隘性所限制，因此，即使是资产阶级或小资产阶级中的最好的革命家，也不可能指出中国社会历史的规律与革命的规律。只有无产阶级的领导才能打破过去革命的限制性与狭隘性，并懂得与根据中国社会历史的规律与革命的规律，提供了中国新生的完全的希望与具体的道路。这种无产阶级的领导乃是从中国共产党的领导、从马克思列宁主义的领导集中表现出来，而中国共产党的成立与马克思列宁主义思想在中国的形成，则是以中国革命知识分子与工人运动相结合为其前提的。
    马克思列宁主义——共产主义的世界观与社会革命论在中国的出现，正如毛泽东同志所说，引起了中国思想领域上的极大的革命，成为中国大革命的先导。这个思想大革命是代表工人阶级的自觉，是代表工人阶级的意识形态对于地主资产阶级及小资产阶级的意识形态的革命；但是，工人阶级开始获得这种科学社会主义——共产主义的意识，却是得到了那些走向工人阶级而与工人阶级相结合的革命知识分子的帮助的，却是那些先接受马克思列宁主义的知识分子在工人阶级中传播这种学说的影响与结果，而毛泽东同志则是在这样一群革命知识分子中最杰出与最伟大的人物。
    知识分子与工人运动相结合，再由此出发，以工人阶级代表的资格，而与农民运动相结合，这样，就又帮助了中国农民运动脱离了原始的宗法的运动形态，而以在无产阶级领导之下的崭新运动形态出现。
    知识分子与工人阶级相结合，而又与农民大众相结合，同时也就使知识分子本身获得了比以前任何时代都没有得到过的力量，改造了自己，显出了巨大的智慧。在长期残酷的与曲折的革命斗争中，虽然有一部分人经不起历史的考验，实行卑鄙下流的叛变，例如五四运动中以编辑“新青年”杂志而著名的陈独秀，在一九二七年就发展了对于资产阶级的投降主义，并在蒋介石汪精卫等国民党反动派血洗革命之后，叛变了革命的阵营，变成了反革命的托洛茨基派，当了法西斯的走狗。又例如曾经在革命队伍中混过若干日子的张国涛，在另一个历史关头，竟走入国民党的特务集团，进行卑鄙的反革命工作。如此等等。除此之外，也有一部分知识分子在艰苦的日子动摇起来，脱离人民，绕了一个大弯子，找不到可走的道路，而又重新回到人民方面来的。但是大多数革命知识分子是经得起考验的，他们在极端苦难的斗争条件下，跟着毛泽东同志一道前进，坚持了人民的旗帜，抱着战胜敌人的决心，毫不顾惜自己的生命。他们的奋斗成为整个人民胜利事业所不可分开的重要一部分。同时，又有许多民主主义的知识分子在长期中坚持拥护人民的正义事业，同样地在历史上留下了很大的光荣。
    三十年来许多革命知识分子的用尽气力与牺牲生命，其所得的代价是在中国历史上空前未有的。可以不算夸大地说：他们在三十年中的成就，就其帮助人民革命胜利这一点上来说，超越了过去中国知识界千百年的成就。
    毛泽东同志在五四运动二十周年的时候说过：“知识分子如果不与工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”“革命的、或不革命的、或反革命的知识分子之最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行结合工农民众，他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点。”三十年来的历史完全证明了毛泽东同志这一个唯一正确的论断。
    毛泽东同志在另一个地方对我们党的同志又说到另一方面：“党应保护革命知识分子。没有革命知识分子，革命不能胜利的。”“一定要吸引和收容大批革命知识分子。要说服工农干部，吃得下，不怕他们；工农没有革命知识分子帮忙不会提高自己；工作没有知识分子不能治国治党治军。”三十年来的历史同样地完全证明了毛泽东同志这一个正确的论断。
  （二）
    我们现在正临着一个新的历史阶段。就是说：一个破坏旧中国的阶段很快地即将过去，一个建设新中国的阶段正在到来。毛泽东同志给我们提出了新的历史课题，就是：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”。这一个新的历史阶段给全国一切愿意与可能为人民服务的知识分子展开了更广阔的道路。正如毛泽东同志所指出：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。如果这一步也值得骄傲，那是比较渺小的，更值得骄傲的还在后头。”“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”也因此，原来已经参加了革命的知识分子决不能对过去的工作自满，而需要在这个建设新中国的事业中负起更重大的责任，执行毛泽东同志对我们全党同志所作的诰诫：“继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”，“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，“学会我们原来不懂的东西”，而避免在新的历史阶段变成落伍的人。同时，我们人民革命的胜利与建设新中国的前途，就使得那一切在过去还没有参加革命行列的全国知识分子，得到了一个空前没有的报效人民和改造自己的一切可能机会。很多人虽然过去没有与工农大众结合，没有参加过去一个历史阶段的革命工作，但是现在大家还是可能而且必须与工农大众结合，参加新的一个历史阶段即建设新中国的工作。现在大家来参加即将到来的准备把农业国变成工业国的生产大革命，参加全国即将到来的准备把文化落后变成文化先进的文化大革命，为时是并不晚的。大家必须知道：如果没有今天人民革命的胜利，要在中国实现这种工业化的生产大革命与普遍启发民智的文化大革命，那是完全不可能的。一九四五年四月间，毛泽东同志的“论联合政府”，对于这个问题曾作了以下的历史总结：
    “在一个半殖民地的、半封建的、分裂的中国里，要想发展工业，建设国防，福利人民，招致国家的富强，多少年来多少人做过这种梦，但是一概幻灭了。许多好心的教育家、科学家、学生们不问政治，自以为可以所学为国家服务，结果也化成了梦，一概幻灭了。这是好消息，这种幼稚的梦的幻灭，正是中国富强的起点。中国人民在抗日战争中学得了许多东西，知道在日本侵略者被消灭之后，有建立一个新民主主义的独立、自由、民主、统一、富强的中国之必要，而这些条件是互相关联的，不可缺一的。果然如此，中国就有希望了。解放中国人民的生产力，使之获得充分发展的可能性，有待于新民主主义的政治条件在全中国境内的实现。”
    毛泽东同志这些话，经过了四个整年，在全中国境内的新民主主义的政治条件，正将很快地完全实现。这也就是说：全国那一切希望自己祖国有伟大将来的知识分子们，现在是完全获得一个自己的“英雄用武之地”了。大家重新和工农相结合，重新和一切人民大众相结合，以建设一个伟大新中国——这个新的历史使命正临在全国知识分子们的身上。
  （三）
    但是，马克思说得好：“教育者先要受教育”。全国知识分子们要为人民服务，就必须去获得为人民服务的意识，并继续在实际工作中获得教育。毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”的著作中已说到了中国共产党改造旧知识分子的任务，“是采取适当方法，教育他们，使他们获得新观点，新方法，为中国人民服务”。
    在前一个历史阶段，工农运动与马克思列宁主义在中国思想领域上所引起的大革命，既促进了许多革命知识分子相继走进了为人民服务的行列；在今后新的历史阶段，人民迫切地需要更多更多的有用的知识分子，而由于人民解放军的胜利正在促进全国知识界一个为人民服务的空前新高潮；和这种新高潮在一起，也就必要旧知识界又来一个关于宇宙观与人生观的思想大革命。知识分子们必须根据百年来——特别是三十年来中国人民革命的实际经验，用马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的新观点，新方法，用辩证法唯物论与历史唯物论的新观点，新方法，在一切学术部门（不论是哲学的、经济的、政治的、历史的、文艺的以及各种自然科学的），去对于自己来一个“重新估定一切价值”，进行批判与自我批判。
    五四运动前后，中国有一些资产阶级学者曾经介绍了西方资产阶级末流若干反动的哲学流派，如胡适搬运美国资产阶级御用哲学的所谓“实验主义”以及张君劢或其他人们所介绍的所谓“柏格森哲学”、“新康德主义”、“新黑格尔主义”、“马赫主义”等等。这些反动的神秘主义的唯心论的西方资产阶级哲学流派，曾经利用中国的文化落后，胡混过一些日子，以对抗辩证唯物论与历史唯物论。他们用这类反动的观点，反动的方法，始终不能解释中国的历史、近代社会与文化问题。他们中间的最反动分子，例如胡适与张君劢，只能为反动派与帝国主义辩护。现在事情很明白：所有这些反动的哲学流派，在中国人民面前是完全破产了。经过三十年来中国人民的斗争及其胜利，马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，辩证法唯物论与历史唯物论，已更加被证明是不可抵抗的真理，而谁不愿意落后，谁就须要认真地去学习它。这种马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的观点与方法，这种辩证法唯物论与历史唯物论的观点与方法，完全不是什么神秘的东西，是完全能够学得到的，只要他肯与工农群众相结合，只要他有为人民服务的热情，只要他不坚持过去的错误成见，只要一个人有那种为着真理而敢于向自己挑战、敢于否定过去错误观点的勇敢。
    纪念五四运动三十周年，我们向全国旧知识界号召接受三十年来革命知识分子光荣的传统，进行这样一个思想大革命，而把工人阶级的宇宙观与人生观来重新武装起自己的头脑。经过这样一个思想大革命，并经过在实践中的新考验，旧知识界也就可以变为人民的新知识界，而当他们能够从工人阶级出发，从人民出发，去获得马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的新观点新方法的时候，他们的有用知识就能够在人民中发出极大的光辉，他们在为人民服务的过程中，就能够真正有效地与进一步地获得伟大的结果。      （新华社北平二日电）
