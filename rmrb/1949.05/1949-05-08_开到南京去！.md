    Drive to Nanjing!
    Cao Ming
    Morning: The Huanggu Tun Railway Factory joyfully sees off the "Nanjing" locomotive;
    Evening: We are thrilled to receive the news of the liberation of Nanjing!
    Speaking of the "Nanjing," it and the "Beiping" were like twin brothers; their mother was the Shenyang Huanggu Tun Railway Factory.
    These two locomotives were extra repairs undertaken by the workers of the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory, who, as masters of their own fate, began to establish a new work ethic in order to support the front lines, outside of the January production plan. The "Beiping" was completed on January 18th, and the "Nanjing" was completed on the 26th.
    The completion of these two locomotives formed a mass production upsurge within the factory, initially changing the face of the factory. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions awarded a silk banner as a prize.
    After its completion, the "Nanjing" was locked in the depot, watching as the "Beiping," after the liberation of Tianjin, was ordered to go to Tianjin on the 22nd, and then entered Beiping along with the liberation of Beiping.
    The "Nanjing," in the depot, complained to its elders: "Why did they call me 'Nanjing'? Look at my brother, named 'Beiping,' he went through the pass long ago, to liberate the compatriots of Beiping. When will I be able to drive to Nanjing?" But it couldn't speak, only held its anger inside, letting dust settle on it layer by layer.
    Some reporters knew the Nanjing was still in the depot, and when they came to the factory, they would go to see it, which gave it a little comfort. It also learned from people's mouths that the Kuomintang had sent representatives to demand peace talks: looking at the insincere appearance of those reactionary fellows, it was really angry and anxious, wishing it could immediately transport the People's Liberation Army to cross the Yangtze River and capture those tortoise kings alive in Nanjing.
    On April 20th, the reactionary government refused to accept Chairman Mao's eight-point peace proposal: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu ordered the army to cross the river. People were invigorated, using all their strength to support the southward advance of the army. The "Nanjing" also rubbed its fists in the depot, waiting to depart. Soon, the higher authorities ordered it to "Drive to Nanjing!"
    On the morning of the 24th, the staff and workers held flags and gathered to see off the "Nanjing" heading south.
    The "Nanjing" felt it hadn't waited in vain, and was very happy. Its strong body slipped back and forth on the tracks inside the factory, expressing its reluctance to part with its mother. Workers climbed onto the car body to wipe away the dust, and its face felt even more beautiful. As they wiped, the workers recalled the broken appearance of this "T6" model locomotive and couldn't help but smile. This dead car had been lying on the north wall for many years. The road ahead was blocked by ash, and it could not be transported to the site. With great difficulty, the ash pile was leveled, but the second difficulty came: the sleepers under the ash pile had rotted, and the workers in the transportation team were afraid of derailing and did not dare to pull it. So they replaced some new sleepers, and only the newly replaced parts, both large and small, amounted to 377 pieces; the repaired parts amounted to 91 pieces; a total of 468 pieces. What an astonishing number! In addition, some technical employees lacked confidence at the time, and the workers' enthusiasm brought them over. Some important materials were lacking, and the workers' ingenuity invented many substitutes, all of which overcame the difficulties.
    —This was already three months ago. Time is constantly advancing, victory is also constantly advancing, and the productivity of the workers is also advancing. Recalling the past, how could they not smile? They smiled, and they said in their hearts:
    "With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we can also build the old China, which was devastated by reactionaries, into a happy and free new China!"
    The "Nanjing" raised its head, spewed smoke, and excitedly enjoyed the people's caress and farewell, and also let the reporters from the Dongying Film Studio take many shots of it. Then, with the mood of a new soldier joining the army to go to the front lines, it left the factory.
    In the evening, the workers were talking under the lights about how the "Nanjing" had left the factory and was heading south. When the "Standard" locomotive, participating in the Northeast Railway Federation of Trade Unions competition, was about to be test-run, suddenly the radio broadcast the good news of the liberation of Nanjing. People couldn't help but be overjoyed, and they all thought in unison: "Fortunately, the Nanjing has already left, what good timing."
    They simply couldn't stay quietly at home, many people ran to the streets to see the extra editions, and some joined the joyous crowds and danced the Yangko. Speaking words that outsiders couldn't understand:
    "Fortunately, the Nanjing from our factory has driven to Nanjing, not sooner or later, it left this morning."
    "The Nanjing from our factory will capture that old thief Chiang alive and bring him back."...
    Their confidence has been unprecedentedly heightened with the victory. They wished they could grow a few more arms to repair more locomotives to support the army in attacking Wuhan and Guangzhou directly.
    April, Shenyang

### 开到南京去！

    开到南京去！
    草明
    早晨：皇姑屯铁路工厂欢送“南京号”；
    晚上：惊喜地收到解放南京的捷报！
    说到“南京号”，和“北平号”原是双生兄弟；它们的母亲是沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂。
    这两台火车头，都是那作了主人、开始建立新的劳动态度的皇姑屯铁路工厂工人，为了支援前线，在一月份的生产计划外加修的。“北平号”在一月十八号落成，“南京号”在二十六日也完成了。
    这两台机车的落成，在本厂内形成了群众性的生产热潮，初步改变了工厂的面目。东北总工会曾奖给一面锦旗。
    “南京号”自落成后，便被关在车库里，眼看着“北平号”在天津解放后二十二号那天就奉命开到平津，并随着北平的解放开进了北平。
    “南京号”在车库里自个儿抱怨起长辈来：“为啥叫我做‘南京号’呢？看我哥哥叫‘北平号’，早就进了关，解放北平的同胞去了。我，啥时候才能开到南京去呢？”可是它不会说话，只闷的一肚子气，让灰尘一层一层地落到它身上去。
    有些记者知道南京号还在车库里，来厂时顺便去瞧瞧它，它稍微得点安慰。它又从人们的口里知道国民党派代表来要求谈判和平：瞅瞅反动家伙的没有诚意的样子，真是又气又急，恨不得马上运送解放军赶紧渡过长江，到南京去活捉那些兔子王八。
    四月二十号，反动政府拒绝接受毛主席的八项和平主张：毛主席朱总司令下令大军渡江。人们都振奋着，用一切力量来支援南下大军。“南京号”便也在车库里磨拳擦掌，等待出发。不久，上级便下令叫他“开到南京去！”
    职工们就在二十四日的上午撑了旗子集队欢送“南京号”南下。
    “南京号”觉得自己没白等，心里十分高兴，健壮的躯体，在厂内的路轨上溜来溜去，表示对母亲的惜别。工友爬到车身上替它擦去灰土，它的面孔更觉漂亮了。工友们一面擦，一面回忆这台文“Ｔ６”型的机车底破损样子，不觉微笑了。单说这台死车，早就躺在北大墙好些年。前面已给灰挡住了路，不能运进现场，好容易把灰堆铲平，但是第二种困难又来了，灰堆下的道木已朽烂，运输班的工友怕掉道，不敢拉，于是又换上了一些新道木，这才把它拉到现场去，只新换上的大小零件就有三百七十七件，修理的大小零件就有九十一件；共四百六十八件。这个数目多么惊人。此外当时有些技术员工缺乏信心啦，工人们的热情把他们带引过来了。缺乏一些重要的器材啦，工人的才智发明了许多代用品，也都把困难克服了。
    ——这已是三个月前的事了，时间不断前进，胜利也不断前进，工友们的生产力也在向前推进。回忆着过去，他们怎能不笑呢？他们笑，他们心里在说：
    “有了共产党和毛主席的领导，咱们也能把那给反动摧残得支离破碎的老中国建设成幸福自由的新中国！”
    “南京号”昂着头，喷着烟，兴奋地享受着人们对它的爱抚和惜别，又让东影制片厂记者给它拍上许多镜头，然后带着参军上前线的新战士的心情，离开了工厂。
    晚上，工友们正在灯下叨咕着“南京号”已出厂南下。参加东北铁路总工会竞赛的“标准号”又快试运转了的时候，突然无线电广播出解放南京的捷报。人们禁不住狂喜，也不约而同的想着：“幸亏南京号已开出去，你看多巧”。
    他们根本无法安静地呆在家里，许多人跑到街上去看号外，也有夹在狂欢的人流里扭起秧歌来。嘴里说着外人听不懂的话：
    “幸亏咱厂的南京号已开到南京去，不早不晚，今儿早上开走的”。
    “咱厂的南京号会去把贼老蒋活捉回来的”。………
    他们的信心随着胜利空前地提高。他们恨不得自己再多长几条手臂，多修一些机车来支援大军直捣武汉和广州。            四月底于沈阳
