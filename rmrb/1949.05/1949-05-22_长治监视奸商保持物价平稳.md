　　Taihang News: Since the establishment of the Changzhi Municipal Organization Production Management Committee in late February of this year, in addition to conducting ideological education for merchants, it has adopted effective measures in managing the market. It regularly inspects and supervises individual speculative shops. Outside merchants must first apply for registration with the city's trade authorities; otherwise, they will be treated as smugglers. At the same time, Taihang Trading Company's Daxing Grain Store vigorously suppresses grain prices through a policy of small profits and large sales, timely purchasing and selling, and adjusting surpluses and deficiencies. Therefore, prices gradually stabilized in the two months from February to April, especially grain prices, which did not undergo major changes. (Zheng He)

　　长治监视奸商保持物价平稳
    【太行讯】长治市自今年二月下旬成立了机关生产管理委员会以来，除对商人进行思想教育外，在管理市场上，采取有效的措施，对个别投机商店经常加以检查和监督，外来商贩须先向本市贸易机关声请登记，否则按走私论，同时太行贸易公司大兴粮店以薄利广销政策，大力平抑粮价，适时吞吐，调剂有无，故在二月到四月两个月中物价逐渐稳定，尤其是粮食价格未发生大变化。（正河）
