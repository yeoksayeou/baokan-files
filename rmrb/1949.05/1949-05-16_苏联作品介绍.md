　　Introduction to Soviet Works

　　Stalin's classic work "The Foundations of Leninism" was first published in Pravda in April and May of 1924. Soviet newspapers published articles on April 26 this year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of this book.

　　The Moscow Young Guard Publishing House recently published a new novel by writer Tikhon Semushkin, "Alitet Goes to the Mountains," which won the Stalin Prize. The book tells the story of how the people of Kamchatka, after being victims of American merchants for a long time, were reborn under the Soviet regime. The entire edition of 15,000 copies was sold out in three days.

　　New books recently published in Moscow include "Russian Women in the Realm of Science" by Professor Vladimir Libasov. The book describes the scientific activities and achievements of Russian women throughout the ages, and states that the first girls' school in Europe was opened in 1086 at St. Andrew's Monastery in Russia.

　　The new Soviet film "The Battle of Stalingrad" premiered on Victory Day over Germany - May 9 - in Moscow, the capitals of the republics, and major Soviet cities. The film was produced by the Moscow Film Studio, written by Nikolai Vilda, directed by Vladimir Petrov, and composed by Aram Khachaturian. The film shows the great scenes of the Battle of Stalingrad, the turning point of the Soviet-German War, and reveals the unparalleled heroism of the Soviet people and the brilliant strategy of their wise leader, Stalin. One of the characteristics of the film is that almost every scene or character actually existed. Nearly 40,000 actors participated in the crowd scenes. On the first day of the film's release in Moscow, the audience was about 200,000 or more. (Compiled by Shen Jiang)
