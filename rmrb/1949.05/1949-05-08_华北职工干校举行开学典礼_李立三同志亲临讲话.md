    North China Workers' Cadre School Holds Opening Ceremony
    Comrade Li Lisan Attends and Speaks
    [Tianjin, 7th Dispatch] The North China Workers' Cadre School held its opening ceremony yesterday, attended by over 2,000 faculty, staff, and students. Comrade Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended and spoke, pointing out that if the working class truly wants to be the masters of the new society, it must intensify its study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It is necessary to cultivate a group of outstanding individuals in the study to directly participate in the leadership of economic, political, and production departments. He hoped that all students would complete the major task of building a new democratic society with the spirit of "suffering first, enjoying later."
