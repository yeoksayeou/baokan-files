    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 12th: TASS reports: Field Marshal Montgomery, Chairman of the Supreme Command of the Western European Union, arrived in the Netherlands on May 6th. The press pointed out that Montgomery's trip was to discuss the Western European military alliance with the Dutch Chief of Staff, because Britain believes that the Dutch Drees cabinet has not made any progress in establishing armed forces for the Western European bloc. It is expected that Montgomery will exert pressure on the Dutch authorities to accelerate the formation of so-called national reserve soldiers and other military forces. At the same time, Montgomery will also inspect the British air force units in the Netherlands.

    反动头子蒙哥马利压迫荷兰加速组军
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社讯：西欧联盟统帅委员会主席蒙哥马利元帅于五月六日抵达荷兰。报界指出，马氏此行是为了与荷兰参谋总长商谈西欧军事联盟问题，因为英国认为荷兰德里斯内阁在为西欧集团建立武装部队上，没有作出什么进展。预料蒙哥马利将对荷兰当局施行压力，使他们加速所谓国民后备兵及其他军事部队的组成。同时，蒙哥马利也将视察在荷兰的英空军部队。
