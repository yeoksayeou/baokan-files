    Democratic Home
    —A Visit to the Democratic Home of Li Shunda, Labor Hero of Pingshun
    By our reporter Li Wen
    The Whole Family Holds Meetings to Set Plans, Everyone Consciously Engages in Production

Last November, Li Shunda, a first-class labor hero of Taihang, invited prominent labor heroes from all over the county to attend the summary of the five-year production and construction plan. After visiting Shunda's home, the heroes praised: Shunda's mother (named Guo Yuzhi, elected as a first-class textile hero in the county in 1947) leads the family well, the whole family is full of joy, and everyone is actively engaged in production. During the summary, everyone also unanimously agreed that the implementation of democracy in Shunda's family, giving full play to the enthusiasm of all men and women, was one of the important reasons for completing the five-year production and construction plan in three and a half years.

Shunda's family is full of new atmosphere. Shunda's mother often says happily: "At home, Shunda is under my leadership. In the village, Shunda is the branch secretary, and I am under the leadership of our Shunda." Whether it is field production or housework, everything is well-organized and scientifically divided: Cai Fu (Shunda's younger brother), Hu Chang (helper), led by Shunda, engage in agricultural production and livestock transportation. Gui Lan (Shunda's wife), Bu Qiao (fourth daughter-in-law), and Ting Xian (Shunda's younger sister) are led by Shunda's mother to manage household life and sideline production such as textiles and pig raising. The whole family holds a family meeting every three months to review their performance in production and life, and to offer criticisms of others. At the beginning of each season, a family meeting is held to arrange life and make production plans. In February this year, the whole family discussed spring production, and each person made a personal production plan based on their own situation. The whole family formulated a production plan before planting, which has now been completed on time, and some projects have even exceeded the original plan: for example, the original plan was to accumulate 300 dan of new fertilizer, but now 500 dan have been accumulated. The original plan was for each person to plant two trees, and the eight people in the family planted a total of 251 trees. The plan to harrow and rake the land once before planting has been realized. Enough firewood has been prepared to last until June in the lunar calendar. Of the 23 large and small embankments, 21 have been built. The original plan was for each woman to spin 10 jin of finished products, but Shunda's mother has completed 12 jin, and Gui Lan has completed 6 jin due to illness affecting production. Only the transportation item fell short, the original plan was for two livestock to earn 1.6 shi of rice, but now only 1 shi of rice has been earned, still 0.6 shi short. Shunda's mother and Shunda are both Communist Party members and often lead the family to discuss the Party's various policies. The first five-year production and construction plan that has been completed (after summarizing the first five-year production and construction plan last November, the second five-year production and construction plan was formulated.) was formulated on the basis of everyone's conscious efforts: In 1945, the Party called on labor to build a family and produce construction, the two of them led the whole family to discuss, realized the glory of labor production, and combined with everyone's requirements: for example, Cai Fu said: "It is too far to carry water, we need to dig a well"; Gui Lan proposed that the millstone is too small, which delays work; Ting Xian proposed a lack of quilts; Shunda's mother proposed adding a hand-operated shuttle loom; Shunda proposed increasing grain production and building houses, giving full play to everyone's opinions, and formulated a five-year plan. Usually, Shunda's mother and Shunda pay attention to listening to everyone's opinions. For example, when construction began, Cai Fu and Shunda suggested: "We build houses, it takes a lot of people to eat, let's repair the mill first, and dig a new well, which can be useful immediately." Everyone adopted this opinion, and the entire construction saved about 2,000 workdays.

    Shunda's Mother Makes Self-Criticism When Democratic Leadership Goes Wrong

Although Shunda's whole family is of one mind, problems sometimes arise, but they are quickly resolved. Sometimes, when Shunda's mother sees that Gui Lan's face is unhappy, she asks Ting Xian: "What did you say to your sister-in-law?" Ting Xian said: "My sister-in-law is being arrogant and acting up, I can't stand her!" Shunda's mother educates Ting Xian: You don't know what kind of temper everyone in the family has? You help your sister-in-law with work, and she will naturally be good to you; on the one hand, she explains to Gui Lan: "You sister-in-law, if you have any difficulties or worries, bring them up to your mother, and we'll discuss how to handle them. If Ting Xian makes you angry, don't be like her little child; if it is really Gui Lan's fault, Shunda's mother will also point it out to her. Even Shunda's mother and Shunda have had disputes: In the spring of the year before last, Shunda's mother was teaching eleven apprentices, busy carrying out the textile movement, and was not at home all day, which increased Gui Lan's burden in life, and she was unhappy. Shunda saw that Shunda's mother was delaying too much work, and was also dissatisfied. Coincidentally, Shunda's shoes were broken, and he asked Gui Lan for shoes, Gui Lan said angrily: "I'm busy from dawn to dusk, I can't make them for you." Shunda asked Shunda's mother for shoes again, and she unintentionally said: "You go ask Gui Lan, if she doesn't have them, you can buy a pair of shoes!" One sentence ignited Shunda's anger: "I don't have that much money, we don't know what you do all year!" Shunda's mother was enthusiastically leading the textile movement at the time, and saying that she had no achievements angered her, and she had a big quarrel with Shunda. After the anger passed, Shunda's mother felt that it was wrong to be temperamental, and Shunda also had a change of heart. The mother and son made self-criticisms face to face: Shunda said: "You are enthusiastic about leading textiles, it was my fault to say that you had no achievements, and it was also wrong to complain that you didn't lead well because Gui Lan didn't have shoes"; Shunda's mother also criticized: "I shouldn't have told you to buy shoes, the sisters can just manage to make them."

Don't look at Shunda's mother's age, her mind is not old. As long as other people's opinions are correct, she easily accepts them. In the family meeting in February this year, Ting Xian criticized Shunda's mother for only urging her to produce, delaying her studies. Shunda's mother thought carefully, and Ting Xian's suggestion was right. Everyone has their own tasks, and it shouldn't delay the children's learning; so she made a self-criticism to Ting Xian.

From the following two things, we can also see Shunda's mother's family leadership: She always takes the lead in leading everyone to work. When building houses last spring, the women pushed the mill, raised pigs, and also helped with mud and moving bricks to do masonry work. Life was very heavy, and some complained: "It's really troublesome to buy so many pigs." Shunda's mother personally busied herself with feeding pigs and pushing the mill. Seeing that she was in her fifties or sixties and still had such great energy, everyone gradually calmed down. She also explained to the women: "Building a house is for us to live in. If we don't suffer bitterness, we won't have sweetness. If we help with work, saving expenses is also for our own family!" This encouraged the emotions of the daughters-in-law, and they continued to build the house well. Shunda's mother pays attention to feeling people's hearts and meeting everyone's needs. Once, Gui Lan wanted to go back to her mother's house. Shunda's mother felt that after she left, the family's life would be heavier, so she didn't allow her to go, and she was very unhappy, and she didn't put much effort into production. Shunda's mother began to get angry with Gui Lan, but after thinking about it carefully, she thought: Daughters should go back to their mother's house. Not letting people go is "old-fashioned." It's not a big "undemocratic," but it's a small "undemocratic." At a family meeting, she made a self-criticism of this thought. After that, when the daughters-in-law went back to their mother's house, Shunda's mother not only did not restrict the date, but also said to the daughters-in-law: "You can live as many days as you want. When our family's production is tight, come home when you should." The daughters-in-law also left happily and returned early. Because Shunda's mother usually pays attention to meeting everyone's requirements, everyone has a lot of enthusiasm for production. Therefore, in the three and a half years of production and construction, the workdays of the daughters-in-law participating in agricultural production alone accounted for one-third of the total. The women's textiles and pig raising earned a total of 35 shi of rice, accounting for more than one-third of the total agricultural income.

    Use Criticism and Self-Criticism to Remove All Obstacles in Production

In a peasant family, changing the old feudal ways has many difficulties. The implementation of criticism and self-criticism in Shunda's mother's family was gradually developed in the daily struggle against the old style. Take Gui Lan's transformation as an example:

Gui Lan and Shunda are both quick-tempered, and they would argue when they disagreed. In addition, Gui Lan's thinking was backward in the first two years, and she complained that Shunda's meetings delayed too much work. Once, the two of them had a disagreement, and Shunda worked in one place, and Gui Lan deliberately went to another place to produce. Shunda's mother and Shunda discussed holding a family meeting to resolve the issue. At the meeting, Shunda's mother first made a self-criticism, pointing out where she was not democratic enough and where she did not lead everyone properly. Shunda also reviewed his own shortcomings: He would get angry when the meal at home was late, and he would also scold people when he was too tired from work. Then Ting Xian and Liu Ying (third daughter-in-law) gave opinions to Shunda, and Gui Lan also gave opinions, but Gui Lan herself did not make a self-criticism. When others gave opinions, she would argue back: "Anyway, it's all my fault, no need to nag anymore!" After the meeting, Liu Ying persuaded Gui Lan, and Shunda's mother personally went to persuade her: "As parents, we discuss everything with everyone. If we make mistakes, we still make self-criticisms. You can boldly raise your opinions to others, and you should also review your own shortcomings. We are all a family, and we shouldn't keep things bottled up and get angry." Although Gui Lan had some changes of heart, her old temper of "I can only talk about myself, but others are not allowed to talk about me" could not be changed for a while. She was always impatient at every family meeting, and she didn't frankly review herself until the autumn of last year, when she truly underwent a big transformation. The root cause of the matter was this:

Gui Lan has a bad temper and doesn't get along with her sisters-in-law and brothers. She doesn't help Cai Fu stir-fry livestock feed, and Cai Fu doesn't help her fetch water; Bu Qiao is weak, Cai Fu helps her fetch water, and Bu Qiao often helps Cai Fu wash clothes and mend clothes. The two of them talk and laugh, and Gui Lan feels uncomfortable. When hoeing autumn seedlings last year, Bu Qiao went back to her mother's house due to illness. When she was busy, she prepared to pick her up, Gui Lan said to Shunda: "It's better not to call Bu Qiao back, she and Cai Fu are fighting and making noise, which makes people laugh." These words reached Cai Fu's ears, and Cai Fu was very "angry," feeling that Gui Lan was talking about him and saying bad things. He clamored to hold a family meeting to solve the problem, and he didn't put any effort into production. The rumors made Bu Qiao know about it, and she cried and made a fuss, insisting on getting to the bottom of it; Ting Xian also had opinions on Gui Lan, feeling that she shouldn't say bad things. Everyone was very angry with Gui Lan, and Gui Lan also felt that things had gone bad. She felt uneasy, but she was unwilling to apologize to Cai Fu and Bu Qiao in person. Shunda's mother and Shunda discussed, based on Gui Lan's temper, if they held a meeting immediately, they were afraid that she would not be able to withstand the criticism, and it would be even more difficult to handle if she got angry. So they first individually straightened out Gui Lan's thinking. At this family meeting, Gui Lan made a good review: "It was all my fault for saying the wrong thing, which made Cai Fu and Bu Qiao angry. I will definitely correct this bad temper," and expressed: "Everyone is good, I don't believe I can't change!" Seeing that Gui Lan's review was sincere, Cai Fu and Bu Qiao calmed down. Solving this mess made the whole family feel happy. During the autumn harvest production, Cai Fu was particularly active. After finishing the autumn harvest, he immediately started transportation. Some families had not finished the autumn harvest, and Cai Fu had already carried coal two or three times. Gui Lan's understanding has also changed. She said: "Family meetings are good, in the old family, this mess would not be easily resolved." In the winter, Gui Lan automatically made a self-criticism to Shunda's mother: "In the past, I had a dependent mentality on you old people, relying on Ting Xian and Bu Qiao to do work, and only felt that I was suffering losses. These ideas are all wrong. This winter, I want to produce well, and I guarantee that I can replace Shunda and my little daughter for the season (in the past, Shunda's clothes were supplied by Shunda's mother)." Gui Lan is strong and actively participates in fieldwork such as repairing edges and building embankments. When she returns home, she seizes the time to spin. By the end of the year, she completed the plan of 6 jin of finished products. At the family meeting, she actively criticized her own style, and the sisters all reflected: "Our sister-in-law has really changed. She is a good hand at production, and she is much better to people than before." Gui Lan's emotions are also higher.

    Listening to the Words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is the Reason for Today's Happy Family

In my conversation with Shunda's mother, she talked about why her "old mind" is not serious (meaning she accepts new things quickly). She said: "For most of my life, I farmed for the landlord, and I couldn't even eat捞饭(稠米饭) every day. Drinking a bowl of vegetable soup, whether it was full or not, was a meal. In the year before the Communist Party came, our family went forty days without seeing a grain of rice. The Communist Party implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform, and we had food and drink. I never dreamed in the past that I would have these twenty or thirty acres of land myself. The Party's marriage policy is good. Without spending money, several of my children married wives, and my energy is even greater! The superiors called for planting more rapeseed, which saved a large famine in the disaster year. They called for planting Golden Queen, and the grain harvest was really abundant. I often thought happily: The new society is really good, and there is no mistake in listening to the words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. A few days ago, I heard that Chairman Mao had entered Beijing, and our whole family was overjoyed. Shunda said to me: "Mother! Let's work hard and produce well. If we have the opportunity to go to Beijing and see Chairman Mao, our wish will be achieved!"

    民主之家
    ——平顺劳动英雄李顺达家庭访问记
    本报记者  力文
    全家开会订计划  人人自觉闹生产
    去年十一月太行一等劳动英雄李顺达，邀请全县各位著名劳动英雄，参加完成五年生产建设计划的总结。众英雄参观顺达家后，曾满口称赞：顺达娘（名叫郭玉枝，一九四七年当选全县一等纺织英雄）家庭领导的好，全家喜气洋洋，人人积极生产。总结时，大家也一致认为：顺达家庭实行了民主，发挥了全家男女的积极性，是三年半完成五年生产建设计划的几个重要原因中的一个。
    顺达家庭里充满着新气象，顺达娘常高兴的说：“在家中顺达属我领导，在村上，顺达是支部书记，我属俺顺达领导。”不论田间生产，还是家务事，都是有条有理，科学的分工：才富（顺达弟弟）胡昌（帮工）顺达领导进行农业生产和牲口运输，桂兰（顺达媳妇）步巧（四儿媳妇）廷先（顺达妹）由顺达娘领导，管理家中生活和纺织、喂猪等副业生产。三个月全家照例开一次家庭会议，个人对自己在生产生活中的表现，进行检讨，对别人有啥意见，提出批评，每逢季节的开始，召开家庭会议，安排生活，订出生产计划。今年二月间，全家讨论春季生产，每个人根据自己的情况订出个人生产计划，全家制订出下种前生产计划，由于全家男女老幼的努力，现已按时完成，有些项目并超过了原计划：比如原计划积新肥三百担，现已积够五百担，原计划每人植树两棵，在家八口人，共植树二百五十一棵，土地在下种前耙一遍耢一遍的计划实现了，准备烧柴够烧到旧历六月，大小堰壑二十三个，已垒起二十一个，原计划每个妇女纺织十斤成品，现顺达娘完成十二斤，桂兰因有病影响生产完成六斤。只有运输一项，原计划两个牲口赚米一石六斗，现只赚米一石，还差六斗未完成。顺达娘和顺达都是共产党员，常领导全家男女讨论党的各种政策，已经完成的第一个五年生产建设计划，（去年十一月总结第一个五年生产建设计划后，并制订了第二个五年生产建设计划。）便是在全家每个人自觉的基础上制订的：一九四五年党号召劳动发家生产建设，他二人领导全家讨论，认识到劳动生产的光荣，并结合每个人的要求：比如才富说：“担水太远，需要打井”；桂兰提出来碾子小，误工多；廷先提出缺被子；顺达娘提出添设手拉梭织布机；顺达提出增产粮食，盖房子，发挥了每个人的意见，制订了五年计划。平素里，顺达娘和顺达注意听取大家的意见，比如建设开始了，才富、顺达提出来：“咱盖房子，用人多吃的多，先修好碾，打新井，马上能顶用”，大家采纳了这个意见，整个建设中约计能省工两千多个。
    顺达娘民主领导有蹩扭就做检讨
    顺达全家虽说都一心，有时也发生问题，但都很快解决了。顺达娘有时看到桂兰脸色不高兴了，她便一面问廷先：“你给你嫂说啥啦？”廷先说：“俺嫂踢踢蹦蹦的耍态度，我不受她的！”顺达娘教育廷先：一家人谁是啥脾气，你还不知道，你好好帮助你嫂做活，她对你自然就好了；一面她给桂兰解释：“你嫂，你有啥困难啥心事，给娘提出来，商量着办，要是廷先给你沤气，别跟她小孩子一样；确实是桂兰的不对，顺达娘也给她指出来。就连顺达娘和顺达也曾有过争吵：大前年春天，顺达娘教着十一个徒弟，忙着开展纺织运动，整天不在家，加重了桂兰的生活，她不高兴，顺达看着顺达娘误工太多，也不满意。偏巧顺达鞋子破了，向桂兰要鞋，桂兰赌气说：“我天明忙到天黑，给你做不出来。”顺达又向顺达娘要鞋，她无意的说：“你去跟桂兰要，她没有，你就买双鞋吧！”一句话，惹起来顺达的火：“我没有这样多钱，咱不知你一年是干的些啥！”顺达娘当时领导纺织正起劲，说她没成绩，把她也气坏啦，给顺达大吵一顿。气头一过，顺达娘觉得耍脾气不对，顺达也有了回心转意，娘俩个面对面进行检讨：顺达说：“你热心领导纺织，说你没成绩是我的错，桂兰没有鞋，也不该埋怨你领导的不好”；顺达娘也检讨：“不该叫你去买鞋，姊妹几个，紧紧手就做出来了。”
    别看顺达娘年纪大，脑筋可不老，只要别人意见对，她容易接受。今年二月里开家庭会，廷先批评顺达娘光督促她生产，耽搁了她的功课，顺达娘仔细想想，廷先提的对啊，各人有各人的任务，不该耽搁孩子们学习；便向廷先作了检讨。
    从下面两件事，也可以看出顺达娘的家庭领导：她啥事都是一马当先领导大家干。去年春天盖房时，妇女们推碾、喂猪，还帮助和泥，搬砖做泥水活，生活很重，有的便发牢骚：“买这样多的猪，真麻烦人”。顺达娘便亲自忙着喂猪、推碾，大家看着她五六十岁年纪，劲头还这样大，自己渐渐安心了，她又向妇女们解释：“盖房子是咱住，不受苦中苦，那来甜上甜，咱多帮助干活，省了开支也是为咱自家啊！”鼓动了媳妇们的情绪，一直把房子盖好。顺达娘注意摸心事，满足每个人的要求。有次桂兰要回娘家，顺达娘觉得她走后，家中生活更重了，没允许她，她很不高兴，生产也不带劲了，顺达娘开始生桂兰的气，自己仔细想了想：闺女到娘家也是应该的，不让人家走，是“老脑筋”，不算大“不民主”，也算个小“不民主”。在一次家庭会议上她把这个思想作了检讨，以后媳妇们回娘家，顺达娘不仅不限制日期并对媳妇们说：“你看着住几天就住几天吧，咱家生产紧了，该回来时就回家”。媳妇们也都是欢欢喜喜的走，及早的回来。由于顺达娘平素里注意满足大家的要求，每个人的生产劲头都很大，因之在三年半的生产建设中，光媳妇们参加农业生产的工数，就占总数的三分之一，妇女们纺织喂猪共赚米三十五石，占农业总收入的三分之一还多。（⑴⑶）
  运用批评与自我批评去掉生产中一切障碍
    在一个农民家庭里，改变掉封建的旧一套，有着许多困难，顺达娘家庭里实行了批评与自我批评，是在日常和旧作风斗争中，渐渐养成的。就拿桂兰的转变来说吧：
    桂兰和顺达两个人都是暴脾气，话不投机便顶起来，再加上头二年桂兰的思想落后，埋怨顺达开会误工多，有次两个人闹起蹩扭来，顺达在这地干活，桂兰故意到那地去生产。顺达娘和顺达商量，开个家庭会解决下吧，开会时，顺达娘先作了自我检讨，那些地方不够民主，那些地方指挥大家不得当。顺达也检查了自己的毛病：看见家里饭做得迟，便要脾气，做活累的厉害了，也吵人。接着廷先、柳英（老三媳妇）都给顺达提了意见，桂兰也提了，可是桂兰自己不作检讨，别人给提意见，就用话顶别人：“反正都是我的不对，不用再嘟噜啦！”会后，柳英劝说桂兰，顺达娘亲自去劝她：“我当父母的有啥事都和大家商量，做错了还作检讨，你对别人有意见，可大胆提，自己的毛病也该检讨，都是一家人，不该有话沤在心里生气。”桂兰虽有些回心转意，“只能自己讲，不准别人说”的老脾气，还一时改不过来，每次开家庭会，总是不耐烦，也不爽爽快快的检讨自己，直到去年秋天，才真正大转变啦，事情的原尾是这样：
    桂兰脾气歪，和妯娌们弟兄们合不来；她不帮助才富炒牲口料，才富也不帮助她打水；步巧身体弱，才富帮她打水，步巧也时常帮助才富洗衣服，补补缝缝，两个人有说有笑，桂兰心里不自在。去年锄秋苗时，步巧因有病回她娘家了，忙活时准备接她回来，桂兰向顺达说：“不叫步巧回来也好，和才富两个人打打闹闹，叽叽咕咕，叫人家笑话”，这句话传到才富耳里，才富十分“恼火”，觉得桂兰说他，坏话，嚷着要开家庭会解决问题的生产也不起劲了，风言风语的又使步巧知道了，更是又哭又闹，非追根不可；廷先也对桂兰有了意见，觉得她不该说坏话，大家都对桂兰的劲很大，桂兰也觉得事情闹糟了，心中不安，却又不愿当面向才富、步巧认错。顺达娘和顺达商量，根据桂兰那脾气，马上开会，怕她吃不住批评，弄顶了更不好办，便先个别把桂兰的思想弄通。这次开家庭会时，桂兰检讨的很好：“都是我说错了话，引得才富、步巧生气，我这歪脾气，一定好好纠正”，并表示：“大家都好，我不信自己改不过来！”见桂兰检讨的实在，才富、步巧也就平气了。解决了这场乱子，一家人都感到痛快，秋收生产时，才富格外积极，忙完秋，接着便搞运输，有的人家秋收未完，才富已驮了二三遭煤。桂兰的认识也转变啦，她说：“家庭会就是好，要在旧家庭里，这场乱了，就不易解决了。”入冬天，桂兰自动向顺达娘作检讨：“过去我对你老人家有依赖思想，攀着廷先、步巧做活，光觉着自己吃亏，这些想法都不对，今冬我要好好生产，我保证能替顺达和小女换季（过去顺达穿衣由顺达娘供给）”。桂兰身强力壮，她积极参加修边垒堰等地里活，回到家便抓紧纺织，到年底完成了六斤成品的计划，在家庭会上，她又积极检讨自己的作风，姊妹们都反映：“俺嫂可真转变了，生产上是好把式，对人比过去好多了。”桂兰的情绪也就更高。
  听共产党毛主席的话才有今天的欢乐家庭
    在我和顺达娘攀谈中，她谈到她的“老脑筋”不厉害（接受新事物快的意思），有个原因。她说：“我多半辈子给地主种地，整天连捞饭（稠米饭）也吃不到，喝上碗菜汤，饱不饱是一顿，共产党来的前一年，俺一家整整四十天没见米粒，共产党实行减租减息，土地改革，俺有吃喝了，我过去做梦也没想到，我自己还会有这二三十亩地，党的婚姻政策好，没有花钱，俺几人孩子娶上了媳妇，我的心劲更大啦！上级号召多种菜子，灾荒年救了大饥荒，号召种金皇后，粮食收的果真多，我常常高兴的想：新社会真正好啊，听共产党毛主席的话没有错。前些天听说毛主席进北京啦，俺一家人欢天喜地，顺达给我说：“娘！咱好好闹生产吧，有机会到北京，见着毛主席，咱的志愿就达到啦！”
