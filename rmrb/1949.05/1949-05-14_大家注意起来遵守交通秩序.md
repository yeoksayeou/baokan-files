    Everyone Pay Attention to Complying with Traffic Order
    In order to prevent traffic accidents, this newspaper has repeatedly appealed loudly, hoping that everyone will jointly pay attention to this major issue concerning life and death, and establish good traffic order in Beiping. However, traffic accidents still occur from time to time recently. What is the reason?
    According to our understanding from various sources, car drivers are indeed paying more attention to traffic rules than in the past, and the phenomena of disobeying commands and driving too fast have decreased. The problem now is that pedestrians still do not observe order, and the police have not taken responsibility. For example, bicycles and pedicabs arbitrarily cut in, drive in fast lanes, and are indifferent when encountering cars, not yielding the right of way. Vendors set up stalls everywhere, even on the roadways. Traffic police often fail to take responsibility for restraining such disorderly behavior; also, some people take an attitude of ignoring or resisting the traffic police's commands. The behavior of a certain tram driver reported in today's newspaper is a very bad example.
    In order to quickly change this situation, on the one hand, we hope that all agencies and car owners will continue to educate their drivers, cultivate their habit of obeying order, and familiarize them with their duties. At the same time, we call on all pedestrians in Beiping to pay attention to this issue, be vigilant, and take responsibility. It should be known that obeying order is the virtue of every good citizen, and violating order is not allowed. If you are not careful when walking, you will harm yourself and others, causing unnecessary losses. We suggest that relevant authorities should strengthen the education of the police, so that they can earnestly take responsibility, exercise their powers, and interfere with, stop, and even take to the Public Security Bureau for legal processing anyone who disobeys commands.
    Now, the Pingjin Garrison Command has ordered the Discipline Inspection Corps to strengthen traffic management to prevent traffic accidents; the Municipal Government has also decided to organize a Municipal Appearance Rectification Committee to study and organize traffic order. The leading organs are paying great attention to this issue. The people of the whole city should recognize this spirit, obey and implement various regulations, and everyone should pay attention to quickly eliminating traffic accidents.

### 大家注意起来遵守交通秩序

    大家注意起来遵守交通秩序
    为了防止车祸，本报曾一再大声疾呼，希望大家共同注意这个行与生死攸关的重大问题，在北平建立良好的交通秩序。但近日车祸仍不时发生，原因究竟在那里？
    据我们从各方面了解，汽车司机比过去确实注意了交通规则，不听指挥、行驶过速的现象已见减少。现在仍有行人不守秩序和警察没有负起责任。如自行车、三轮车随意抢路，在快车道上行驶，遇到汽车满不在乎，不给让路。摊贩随处摆列，甚至摆到车行道上。交通警察对于这种不守秩序的现象，常常未能负责约束；也有些人对于交通警察的指挥，采取不理或反抗的态度，今日报载某电车司机的行为，就是一个非常恶劣的例子。
    为了迅速改变这种情况，我们一方面希望各机关与各汽车所有者对自己的汽车司机继续进行教育，培养他们遵守秩序的习惯，熟习自己的业务。同时我们号召全北平市的行人重视这个问题，大家警惕，大家负责。须知遵守秩序是每一个良好公民的美德，违犯秩序则是不能允许的。如果行路不注意，即会自误误人，招致不必要的损失。我们建议：有关机关应该加强对警察的教育，使他们切实负责，行使职权，对于任何不听指挥的人，都可干涉、制止，以至带到公安局依法处理。
    现在，平津卫戍司令部已训令纠察总队加强交通管理，防止车祸发生；市政府也决定组织市容整顿委员会，研究整理交通秩序。领导机关是十分注意这个问题，全市人民应该认识这种精神，服从与执行各种规定，大家注意起来，迅速灭车祸。
