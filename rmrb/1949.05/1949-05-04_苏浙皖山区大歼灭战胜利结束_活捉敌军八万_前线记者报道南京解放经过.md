    Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 3rd: The great annihilation battle in the mountainous areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, north of the Changxing, Guangde, and Langxi line, concluded victoriously at 5:00 PM on April 29th. In the two days of the 28th and 29th, the People's Liberation Army captured over 27,000 enemy troops in the areas north and northeast of Guangde, bringing the total to over 80,000. Detailed battle results are still being tallied.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front (Delayed): A frontline reporter reports on the liberation of Nanjing, stating: The People's Liberation Army, assembled on the north bank of the Yangtze River, immediately launched a great Yangtze River crossing offensive upon receiving the order to advance from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. In the two days of the 20th and 21st, the Western, Central, and Eastern Route armies successfully crossed the Yangtze River on a thousand-mile front stretching from Jiangyin in the east to east of Jiujiang in the west, landing victoriously on the south bank and continuing their southward advance, causing the bandit troops to collapse at the mere sight of them. At this time, the bandit troops huddled around Nanjing retreated in large numbers along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway in a state of utter chaos, while small groups of remnants remained in Pukou, Puzhen, and Nanjing City on the north bank to cover the retreat and carry out sabotage. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the Liberation Army captured Pukou and Puzhen, and the defending bandits fled south across the river in panic, burning or sinking most of the ships at the Pukou docks. On the morning of the 23rd, the remnant bandits in Nanjing City set fire to several houses and fled the city amidst thick smoke and flames. On the afternoon of the same day, the advance units of the Liberation Army, which had reached eastern Nanjing, entered the city through Hepingmen led by Battalion Commander Lai Changsheng and intercepted a large batch of military supplies that the bandit troops were attempting to transport away. At 8:00 PM on the same day, the Liberation Army on the Pukou side quickly crossed the river by concentrating the remaining ships on the north bank. The dockworkers at the Xiaguan Wharf on the south bank, seeing the Liberation Army ships coming south, eagerly steered their small boats towards the north bank, exclaiming excitedly, "Comrades, you've worked hard! The bandits have run away! Please hurry and take our boats!" The dockworkers gathered all the ships that had not been burned by the bandit troops. The power plant workers also drove the small steamboats from the plant to welcome this people's army. The vast river surface was temporarily filled with a constant stream of ships. After thousands upon thousands of Liberation Army soldiers landed at Xiaguan, the automobile workers also drove out the various cars they had preserved, joyfully welcoming the Liberation Army into the city. From 12:00 AM on the 23rd until the morning of the 24th, the magnificent ranks of the Liberation Army, carrying new types of light and heavy weapons, poured through Yijiangmen into Nanjing City, the anti-revolutionary center of the Kuomintang bandit gang for over twenty years, amidst the cheers of millions of people lining the streets.

    前线记者报道南京解放经过
    【新华社长江前线三日电】长兴、广德、郎溪一线以北苏浙皖山区的大歼灭战，已于四月二十九日下午五时全部胜利结束。二十八、二十九两天中，解放军在广德以北及东北地区又俘敌二万七千余人，连前共俘敌八万余名，详细战果，正清查中。
    【新华社长江前线电】（迟到）前线记者报道南京解放的经过称：结集长江北岸的人民解放军，于接到毛主席、朱总司令的进军命令后，立即发动伟大的渡江攻势，在二十、二十一两日内，西、中、东三路大军即在东起江阴、西迄九江以东的千里战线上强渡长江，胜利登陆南岸，并把进攻的矛头继续向南疾指，匪军望风披靡。此时局促南京一带的匪军即大股沿京杭国道狼狈溃退，小股残匪则仍留在北岸浦口、浦镇及南京城内，以掩护退却和进行破坏。二十二日下午，解放军攻克浦口、浦镇，守匪仓惶渡江南逃，并烧毁或炸沉了浦口码头的大部船只。二十三日上午，南京城内残匪放火焚烧了若干房屋，在浓烟烈火弥漫中逃窜出城。当日下午，进抵南京东部的解放军前哨部队，由赖长胜营长率领由和平门入城，截获匪军正图运走的大批军用物资。同日下午八时，浦口方面的解放军集中了北岸剩余的船只迅速渡江。南岸下关码头的水手们看到解放军船只南来，急忙把自己的小船摇向北岸，兴奋地欢呼：“同志们，你们辛苦了！土匪们已经滚蛋了！请赶快坐我们的船过来吧！”水手们把一切未被匪军烧毁的船只都集中起来。发电厂工人把厂里的小火轮也开过来迎接这支人民的队伍。茫茫江面，一时船只穿梭如织。当成千成万的解放军在下关登陆后，汽车工人们也把他们保存下来的各色汽车开来，兴高采烈地迎接解放军入城。由二十三日夜十二时起直至二十四日上午，解放军雄壮的行列，带着新式轻重武器，在千百万群众夹道欢迎中，经挹江门源源开入这座二十多年来被国民党匪帮作为反革命中心的南京城。
