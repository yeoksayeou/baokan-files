Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: Moscow dispatch: Currently, every collective farm in the Soviet Armenian Republic has several livestock farms. Compared with pre-war levels, Armenia's stock of beef and dairy cattle has increased by 18 percent, sheep and goats have increased by 56 percent, and pigs have increased by 31 percent. The milk production of dairy cows has also greatly increased.
