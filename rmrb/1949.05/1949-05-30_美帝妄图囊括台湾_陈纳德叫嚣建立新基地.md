Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th: U.S. imperialism is continuing to intensify its aggression against China's Taiwan and the southwestern and northwestern provinces. A group of eleven, including @ Gershen, the former Deputy Military Attaché of the U.S. Embassy to the Kuomintang government, flew to Pingtung, Taiwan, on the 23rd, to confer with Sun Liren, the commander of the bandit army's training, and inspect the Zuoying naval port. More than 50,000 tons of U.S. military surplus materials (including aircraft parts, tanks, etc.) transported from Pacific islands and stored in Taiwan have arrived. Griffin, Deputy Director of the China Division of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, and Green, the head of the Industrial Group of the agency, flew to Taipei from Hong Kong on the 25th to investigate the overall situation of rural Taiwan. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th, quoting British official sources, the United States has indicated its intention to include Taiwan in the U.S.'s "defense chain" and provide a "refuge" for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Lapham, Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, went to Chongqing and Chengdu to inspect from the 16th to the 20th and returned to the United States on the 23rd. According to a Reuters report quoting "American Aviation Weekly," Chennault's air force is planning to establish air routes from South and Southwest China to Lanzhou, Tibet, Xining, Ningxia, Yumen, and Tianshui. Earlier this month, Chennault clamored in the U.S. Congress for assistance to the Kuomintang bandit gangs in establishing resistance bases in the southwestern and northwestern provinces.
