Especially in the last two or three years, the bandit Yan Xishan has placed us in hunger, disease, and terror, making it impossible to live and impossible to die. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army came to relieve the people from their suffering and punish the guilty, liberating Taiyuan, and the 300,000 people of Taiyuan began to celebrate their rebirth. From now on, under the leadership of the Taiyuan Military Control Commission, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government, we will strive to restore and develop Taiyuan's industrial production and build a new Taiyuan! We, on behalf of the 300,000 people of Taiyuan City, extend our highest respects to you! Taiyuan City Celebration of the Liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan. May 10th.
