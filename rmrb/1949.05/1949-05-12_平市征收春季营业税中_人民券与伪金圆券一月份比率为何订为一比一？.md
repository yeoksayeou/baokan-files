Inquiry and Answer

    Regarding the collection of the spring business tax in Beiping:
    Why was the ratio of People's Currency to Puppet Gold Yuan notes set at one-to-one for January?

    To the Editorial Department:
    Our merchants believe that the results of the evaluation of this spring business tax by the Municipal Taxation Bureau are relatively fair and reasonable. However, there are still two questions that we would like you to answer.

    1.  The tax amount for January of this year was calculated when the Puppet Gold Yuan was circulating in the market. Now the government stipulates that the ratio of the Puppet Gold Yuan to the Renminbi in January is one to one. How was this stipulated?

    2.  During the tax declaration and evaluation, the working comrades were able to adopt a persuasive and educational attitude, which is good. However, is it appropriate for the People's Government to continue to persuade individual merchants who are late in paying? In particular, will this be effective? Please consider this.
                                                        Reader Xu Qing

    Mr. Xu Qing: The answers to your inquiries are as follows:

    1.  Beiping had not yet been liberated in January of this year. At that time, the Puppet Gold Yuan was still the circulating currency in the market. Beiping was liberated in February, and the People's Government temporarily allowed the Puppet Gold Yuan to circulate for a short period of time in order to take care of the people's difficulties, but stipulated that the Renminbi was the standard currency. Therefore, the monetary units recorded by merchants in their declarations of spring business turnover and remuneration commissions differ from month to month. This tax collection uses the Renminbi as the unit of calculation. There is no problem with the legal exchange rate between the Puppet Gold Yuan and the Renminbi in February (ten to one). Only the ratio for January needs to be clearly stipulated. In order to be fair and reasonable, the true purchasing power of the Puppet Gold Yuan at that time should be converted into the number of jin of millet, and then converted into Renminbi for tax payment based on today's millet price. For example, if a merchant declares that his business turnover in January was 78,500 Puppet Gold Yuan, and the average price of millet at that time was 15.7 yuan (Puppet Gold Yuan) per jin, then it should be converted into 5,000 jin of millet. Then, according to today's (10th) price of 57 yuan Renminbi per jin of millet, it should be converted into 285,000 yuan Renminbi. Such a conversion is more reasonable. However, in order to take care of the merchants' burden, the People's Government has set the ratio of Puppet Gold Yuan to Renminbi in January of this year at one to one. In this way, after converting 5,000 jin of millet according to the above example, it is only 78,500 yuan Renminbi, reducing the merchants' burden by more than three times. This is the main reason why we stipulated that the conversion rate of Puppet Gold Yuan to Renminbi in January is one to one.

    2.  The People's Government's collection of business tax is mainly to promote various construction projects in Beiping, which is also beneficial to the prosperity of the city's industries and commerce. Therefore, citizens have the obligation to pay taxes. If some individual merchants are still delaying payment as they did in the past during the Kuomintang era, the People's Government will continue to persuade them to pay and will also impose penalties in accordance with the regulations.

### 平市征收春季营业税中  人民券与伪金圆券一月份比率为何订为一比一？

    平市征收春季营业税中
    人民券与伪金圆券一月份比率为何订为一比一？编辑同志：
    本市税务局关于此次春季营业税评议结果，我们商户认为比较公平合理。但还有两个问题，请予解答。
    一、本年度元月份之税额，在当时市面流通的是伪金元券，今政府规定元月份的伪金元券与人民币的比率为一比一，这是如何规定的？
    二、此次征税申报评议时，工作同志均能采取说服教育的态度进行工作，这是好的；可是仍有对个别商户迟迟缴纳，而人民政府仍持劝说态度，是否合适？特别是能否发生效力？请加考虑。          读者徐清
    徐清先生：兹将所询答复如下：
    一、本年度元月份北平尚未解放，当时市场上仍以伪金元券为流通单位。二月份北平解放，人民政府为照顾人民困难，曾暂准伪金元券短期流通，但规定以人民币为本位货币。因此各商户在申报春季营业额及报酬佣金等帐时，各月货币之记载单位也不同。此次征税以人民币为计算单位，二月份伪金元券与人民币已有法定比价（十比一），当无问题。只有元月份之比率须明确规定。为求公平合理，应依当时伪金元券之真实购买力折成小米斤数，然后再依据今日米价折合人民币纳税。例如某商户申报一月份之营业额为伪金元券七万八千五百元，以当时平均米价十五元七角（伪金元券）一斤折合成小米后，应为五千斤，再按今（十）日每斤小米价人民币五十七元折合成人民币，则应为二十八万五千元。如此折合比较合理。但人民政府为照顾商人负担，故将本年度元月份伪金元券与人民币之比率定为一比一。如此按上例五千斤小米折价后，仅为人民币七万八千五百元，商户负担减少三倍多。这是我们规定元月份伪金元券折合人民币为一比一的主要原因。
    二、人民政府开征营业税，主要为了推进平市各项建设工作，对本市各工商业之繁荣也是有利的。因此市民有纳税之义务。如有某些个别商户仍象过去国民党时代一样，迟迟交纳，人民政府除继续劝说缴纳外，并将照章处罚。
