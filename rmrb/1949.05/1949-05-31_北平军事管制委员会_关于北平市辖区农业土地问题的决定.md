[Ping Shi News] The Beiping Military Control Commission recently announced a decision on agricultural land issues in the Beiping municipal area. The full text is as follows:

The agricultural land issue in our municipal area is complex and different from that of general rural areas. First, land prices and rents here are more significantly affected by the location of the land, and the benefits generated by the socio-economic development of the city are more obviously encroached upon by a small number of parasitic landowners. Second, the feudal land ownership system here not only directly restricts the development of general agricultural production, but also directly hinders the rational use of land for industrial and various urban construction projects, thereby hindering the progress of industrial and urban construction. Third, there is a large amount of horticulture here that produces vegetables for the urban population, and the collection of feudal land rent not only directly restricts the development of horticultural production, but also directly affects the lives of people of all classes in the city. Fourth, the agricultural operators who supply vegetables include self-cultivating poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, tenant poor peasants, and tenant middle peasants, as well as tenant rich peasants, operating landlords, and agricultural capitalists. Improper handling of this land issue will also affect the production and supply of vegetables in the city. Fifth, a large number of non-agricultural people are interspersed with farmers in the agricultural areas of the city. At the same time, the development of the city will require the construction of a large number of factories, shops, residences, roads, and highways, requiring full, free, and rational use of all urban and rural land. If land is equally distributed here, all farmers will become farmers with little or insufficient land due to the equal distribution of land, which will also be detrimental to the development of urban construction. Therefore, in the suburbs of the city, although it is necessary to abolish the feudal and semi-feudal land system like in general rural areas, that is, to confiscate the land of landlords and the land rented out by rich peasants, it is not possible to implement equal land distribution and general private ownership after equal land distribution as in rural areas. Therefore, based on the specific circumstances of agricultural land ownership and use in our municipal area, the following treatment methods are stipulated:

	I.	The right to cultivate and ownership of all land belonging to self-cultivating farmers, including the self-cultivated portion of rich peasants, shall remain unchanged.
	II.	Confiscate all land of landlords and requisition the land rented out by rich peasants, and uniformly manage and rent it out by the Municipal People's Government in accordance with the circumstances. However, for landlords who need to rely on land for a living, when confiscating land, they should be left with a portion of land roughly equivalent to that of an average middle peasant. If they have other income, they may be left with less or no land.
	III.	After the land is confiscated and requisitioned for public ownership, regardless of whether the original land user is a tenant poor peasant, tenant middle peasant, tenant rich peasant, operating landlord, agricultural capitalist, or other land user, and regardless of whether it was originally public or private land, the original cultivation and use shall generally be maintained, except for land that has been seized and used by local tyrants.
	IV.	All land cultivated by machines shall remain unchanged regardless of whether the land ownership has changed.
	V.	After the land cultivated by farmers belonging to landlords and rich peasants is confiscated for public ownership, no more rent shall be paid, and only a unified progressive agricultural tax shall be paid to the government, the tax rules for which will be determined separately.
	VI.	When confiscating the land of landlords, the draft animals and farm implements used by tenants who rent the landlord's original land should be transferred to the ownership of the tenants. With the approval of the district government, a portion of the landlord's grain may also be collected and distributed to farmers who lack production funds. Other floating assets of the landlord will no longer be confiscated or requisitioned.
	VII.	The deposit and advance rent paid by the tenant shall be returned to the tenant by the landlord, but if the lessor is a poor, old, weak, or orphaned person and is unable to return it, it shall be handled separately.
	VIII.	Those whose living standards do not exceed that of a middle peasant and who rent out a small amount of land due to lack of labor or because they are engaged in other occupations and are unable to cultivate it themselves, their land shall not be subject to confiscation. In the future, the land they have obtained or retained may continue to be rented out, and the rent shall be freely agreed upon by both the landlord and tenant.
	IX.	The confiscation of landlords' land and the requisition of rich peasants' rented land: shall be carried out by the district and village farmers' associations under the leadership of the government. If the farmers' association has not been established or is not sound enough to be competent, it shall be carried out by the local people's government, but positive peasant activists or peasant representatives must be invited to participate. The determination of the class status of landlords and rich peasants shall be evaluated by the village farmers' congress with the participation of the individuals themselves, and shall be reported to the district government for approval and posted by the village farmers' association. If the individual still disagrees after the district government's approval, they may file an appeal to the Municipal People's Court within five days after the posting. It shall not be executed before the court has made a judgment.
	X.	The people have the right to file accusations and demand compensation from the People's Court for the crimes of local bullies and despots, and no one shall obstruct them. However, the masses shall not take actions such as hanging and beating or other direct actions that directly infringe on the property rights and human rights of the accused, and shall await the judgment of the People's Court.
	XI.	All arable wasteland, under the condition that it does not hinder urban construction and scenery, shall be uniformly distributed by the government for use by farmers who lack land. Those who reclaim wasteland shall be exempt from taxes for one to three years, depending on the soil quality and location.
	XII.	These measures only apply to agricultural land cultivation in the area under the jurisdiction of this city and shall be implemented from the date of issuance.

　　北平军事管制委员会
  　关于北平市辖区农业土地问题的决定
    【平市讯】北平军事管制委员会，顷公布关于北平市辖区农业土地问题的决定，全文如下：
    本市辖区内的农业土地问题，是复杂的，是与一般农村不同的。第一、这里的地价地租，受其土地所在位置的影响更大，由城市社会经济发展所产生之利益，更明显地为少数寄生的土地所有者所侵吞。第二、这里封建土地占有制，不仅直接束缚一般农业生产的发展，而且直接妨碍工业及城市各种建设事业对土地之合理的使用，因而妨碍工业及城市建设事业之进行。第三、这里有大量的为供给城市人民蔬菜而生产的园艺，封建地租之征收，不仅直接束缚园艺生产之发展，而且直接影响城市各阶层人民之生活。第四、供给蔬菜的农业经营者，有自耕的贫农、中农、富农和佃贫农及佃中农，也有佃富农，经营地主和农业资本家等，对于是项土地问题处理不当，也会影响城市蔬菜的生产和供给。第五、在本市农业地区与农民杂处的有大批的非农业人口，同时，在城市发展中又将有大量的工厂、商店、住宅和马路、公路等之修筑，需要充分自由合理地使用城乡所有土地，在这里如果也实行土地平分，则全体农民将因土地平分而变成少地即耕地不足之农民，并且不利于城市建设事业之发展，因此在城市郊区，虽需要和一般农村一样废除封建与半封建的土地制度，即没收地主的土地和富农出租的土地，却不能和乡村一样实行土地平分和土地平分后的一般私有制。兹特根据本市辖区内农地占有与使用的具体情况，规定处理办法如下：
    一、所有自耕农民之土地，包括富农自耕部分之土地在内，其耕种权与所有权一律照旧保持不变。
    二、没收所有地主之土地并征收富农出租之土地，统一由本市人民政府管理并酌量出租，但对于需要依靠土地为生之地主，在没收土地时，应留给以大体与普通中农相等之一份土地，如有其他收入者可酌量少留或不留予土地。
    三、在土地被没收与征收归公之后，不论原土地使用者为佃贫农、佃中农、佃富农或经营地主与农业资本家或其他土地使用者，也无论原来为公地或私地，一般维持原耕、原用不动，但恶霸等仗势侵占使用之土地不在此限。
    四、凡使用机器耕种之土地，不论其土地所有权有无变动，一律原耕不动。
    五、农民耕种的地主和富农的土地，在没收归公之后，一律不再交地租，只向政府缴纳统一的农业累进税，其税则另定之。
    六、没收地主之土地时，租种该地主原有土地之佃户所使用的耕畜、农具应转为佃户所有。经区政府批准后并得征收地主一部分粮食，分给缺少生产资金的农民，对于地主其他浮财，不再没收或征收。
    七、佃户已缴之押金及预缴之地租，地主应退还佃户，但如出租土地者为贫苦之老弱孤寡，无力退还时，应另行调处之。
    八、生活不超过中农水准，因缺乏劳动力，或因从事其他职业无力自耕而以少数土地出租者，其土地不在没收之列，今后其分得或留有之土地仍可继续出租，其租额由东佃双方自由议定之。
    九、关于地主土地的没收与富农出租土地的征收：在政府领导下由区村农会执行之，农会尚未建立或不健全不能胜任时，由当地人民政府执行之，但须邀请正派农民积极分子或农民代表参加。关于地主富农成份之划定，由村农民大会邀集本人参加评定之，并应报告区政府批准，由村农民会贴榜公布之。区政府批准后如本人仍不同意时，得于贴榜公布后五日内向市人民法院提出申诉，在法院未判决前不得执行。
    十、人民对于土劣恶霸的罪行，有向人民法院提起控诉及要求赔偿之权，任何人不得加以阻挠。但群众不得采取吊打或其他直接行动，直接侵犯被控诉者之财权人权，应听候人民法院之判处。
    十一、一切可耕之荒地，在不妨碍城市建设与风景的条件下，由政府统一分配予缺少土地之农民使用。垦种荒地者免税一年至三年，视其地质与位置而定。
    十二、本办法只适用于本市所辖地区内之农业耕作的土地，并自本日起施行之。
