    Jingxing Women
    Making Shoe Soles to Overcome the Spring Famine
    [Chahar News] With the active efforts of the Party, government, and people, Jingxing has initially reversed the spring famine situation. The county has many mountains and little land, and is known for its harsh conditions. Coupled with consecutive years (the year before last and last year) of drought and poor harvests, this year's spring famine is severe. The county Party committee and government, as early as last winter, called on the masses to utilize their skills and engage in diverse sideline production; at the same time, they instructed the county's Limin Shoe Factory to expand its business and increase the supply of shoe soles for disaster-stricken women to produce. They also contacted the Shijiazhuang Shoe Factory to supply some soles. For greater convenience, the leadership took the initiative to negotiate with 19 shoe factories in Shijiazhuang and arranged for unified delivery to the Jingxing County Promotion Cooperative, which would distribute them locally. According to a one-month statistic, a total of 146,000 pairs of shoe soles were distributed, earning 365,000 jin of rice. Women from villages forty or fifty li away from the city traveled in groups, even at night, to carry the soles back, showing great enthusiasm. The first district, which suffered more severely from the disaster, had a third of its households without food as early as the February survey, but since the campaign to make shoe soles was launched, the masses have not been as panicked as before. In Guiquan Village, with over a hundred households, more than 300 jin of rice can be earned in a day. (Liu Yongbin)

    井陉妇女
    纳鞋底渡春荒
    【察哈尔讯】井陉在党政民的积极努力下，已初步扭转春荒局面。该县山多地少，素称寒苦，加之连年（前年去年）荒旱歉收，今年春荒严重。县委与政府远在去冬即一方面号召群众发挥一技之长，进行多种多样的副业生产；一方面责成本县利民鞋厂扩大营业，增放鞋底，以供灾妇生产，并与石家庄鞋厂联系，供给一部底子。为更方便起见，领导上主动与石家庄十九家鞋厂交涉好，统一送井陉县推进社，由推进社就地发放。据一个月统计，共放鞋底十四万六千双，挣米三十六万五千斤。离城四五十里地的妇女们，三五成群，连夜赶来背底子，情绪很高。一区灾荒较重，在二月份调查即有三分之一的户没粮吃，但自从发动纳底以来，群众已不象以前那样恐慌了。百余户的贵泉村，一天能进三百多斤米。  （刘永彬）
