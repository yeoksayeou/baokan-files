Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS, Paris—The Politburo of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 5th and issued a communiqué stating that the rallies held throughout France to report on the work of the peace congresses have united compatriots of all religious faiths. They are inspired by one will, which is to defend peace and oppose the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Politburo urged all members of the French Communist Party to do their utmost to ensure unity with French men and women fighting to defend peace. The communiqué also stated that the Politburo announced its fraternal solidarity with the French working people's efforts to defend collective contracts, wages, etc. The French government's policies have worsened the living conditions of workers. This policy is old, not only in opposing trade union members and industrial workers, but also in opposing handicraftsmen and the masses of peasants who bear heavy taxes. This disastrous impoverishment policy is the result of huge expenditures on waging war in Vietnam and preparing for a new world war.

    法共政治局号召党员
    联合男女同胞一致保卫和平
    【新华社北平八日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法共政治局于五日举行会议，会后发表公报称：目前在法国各地举行的发表和平大会工作报告的集会，团结了一切宗教信仰的男女同胞。他们为一个意志所鼓舞，就是保卫和平及反对北大西洋公约的签字。政治局敦促法共全体党员尽其一切努力保证与为保卫和平而奋斗的法国男女联合一致。公报又称：政治局宣布对于法国劳动人民保卫关于集体合同、工资等等的努力，作兄弟般的声援。法国政府的政策已使职工的生活条件恶化。这一政策是旧的，不仅在反对工会会员和产业工人，而且在反对手工业工人和担负苛重赋税的农民大众。这一灾难性的贫困化的政策，是在越南进行战争和准备新的世界战争的巨大开支的结果。
