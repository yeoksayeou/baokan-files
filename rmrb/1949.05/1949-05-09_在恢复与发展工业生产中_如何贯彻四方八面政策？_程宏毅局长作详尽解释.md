    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 8th), the Bureau of Industry and Commerce continued to hold a general meeting for the machinery and metal smelting industries to convey and explain the significance of this round of general re-registration for industry and commerce. 493 member companies and 80 non-member companies of the Machinery Industry Trade Association attended. 48 member companies and 12 non-member companies of the Metal Smelting Industry Trade Association attended. In his speech, Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, first explained the principle of "taking care of all four sides and eight aspects, leaving none out" as instructed by Chairman Mao for developing production. He said that the first thing to consider is mutual benefit for both public and private sectors, which are two sides of the same coin. China is a country with backward production and a shortage of commodities. To greatly develop industry, in addition to state-owned enterprises, private legitimate industry and commerce must also be given full opportunities for development. Both public and private sectors must be taken into account and neither can be neglected. Second is mutual benefit for both labor and capital, which is another two sides of the same coin. Excessive exploitation and feudalistic oppression of workers must be eliminated to ensure workers' livelihoods, improve production efficiency, and increase their enthusiasm for production. On the other hand, capitalists should also be able to profit and increase their enthusiasm for management, absorbing idle capital into production. At the same time, it is hoped that capitalists will tell the truth, inform the workers and the government about the real situation in the factory, and that everyone will sincerely discuss and resolve all disputes through labor-capital consultation, resolving labor-capital disputes and all difficulties under the premise of developing production. Third, consideration must be given to both urban and rural areas, which is also two sides of the same coin. Urban and rural areas must communicate and help each other, enabling the reasonable exchange of industrial and agricultural products. Finally, consideration must be given to both domestic and foreign aspects. Under the principle of benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood, and promoting the development of our own industry, import and export trade must be well managed and appropriately resolved. Our policy is to take care of all four sides and eight aspects; neglecting any one aspect is not good. Secondly, he explained the meaning and purpose of registration, saying: "In order to solve the many difficulties that still exist in sales, raw materials, and capital, and to enable all businesses to move from blind production to planned production, and to facilitate government guidance and support for industry and commerce, the government must have a detailed understanding of the situation of all industries. This general re-registration is intended to achieve this goal. Therefore, we hope that all manufacturers will fill out the forms seriously and accurately, without any concerns." In his speech, he also emphasized that the machinery and metal smelting industries in this city have extremely broad development prospects. For example, the Cixing Iron Factory had only a dozen workers at the beginning of liberation. Recently, due to the gradual opening up of sales channels, the factory's active management, and the government's support, it has increased to more than fifty workers, and is still preparing to continue expanding production. This is just one example. Because the more than 50 million people in North China and the vast rural areas urgently need cities to help improve and supply a large number of agricultural implements and other tools and machinery to develop rural production, this vast market is full of unlimited prospects for the development of the machinery industry. He called on all larger manufacturers to formulate their own production plans and carry out production according to the plan. This will make it easier for the government to provide guidance and help solve the difficulties encountered in production. He also called for strengthening the trade associations and reforming all unreasonable aspects of the past. All members should actively promote and supervise the trade associations so that they truly serve industrialists and businessmen and do things for everyone. Only with an organization can we easily solve the difficulties in production for everyone. Finally, Comrade Shi Lin, Director of the Secretariat, explained the items in the registration methods one by one, mainly regarding the capital item. He explained that the fixed capital listed on the form, such as factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment, only needs to be filled in at the current value converted into RMB. Working capital is the capital excluding liabilities, raw materials, and inventory, etc., calculated at 80% of the market price. However, if the scale is too small, such as household industries, and it is too difficult to estimate, it can be left blank. However, the amount of machinery, equipment, and capital must still be clearly filled in. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.

    在恢复与发展工业生产中
    如何贯彻四方八面政策？
    程宏毅局长作详尽解释
    【本报讯】昨（八）日工商局继续召开了机器业和金属品冶制业的全体大会。传达解释这次举行工商业重新普遍登记的意义。到有机器业同业公会会员四百九十三家，非会员八十家。金属品冶制业同业公会会员四十八家，非会员十二家。工商局程宏毅局长在讲话中，首先就毛主席所指示的发展生产要照顾到四方八面，缺一不可的原则，加以解释。他说第一要照顾公私两利，这是一方的两面，中国是个生产落后的国家，商品是缺乏的，要大量发展工业，除了公营企业以外，还必须使私人正当工商业得到充分发展的机会。必须公私兼顾，不能偏废。第二劳资两利，这又是一方的两面，对工人过高的剥削和封建性的压迫必须取消，要使工人生活有保障，生产效率和生产积极性才能提高；但另一方面也要使资方有利可图，提高资本家经营的积极性，吸收游资到生产中来，同时希望资方应说老实话，把厂里的真实情形告诉工人、告诉政府，有事大家诚意商量，劳资协商解决一切争执，从发展生产的前提下，解决劳资纠纷，解决一切困难。第三要照顾到城乡，这又是一方的两面，必须使城乡互相沟通，互相帮助，使工业品和农业品合理地交换。最后要照顾到内外两面，在有益于国计民生，有利于发展我们自己的工业的原则下，对出入口贸易要进行很好的管理，并予以适当的解决。我们的政策是要照顾到四方八面，缺一面都是不好的。其次，他解释登记的意义和目的说：“为了解决目前还存在的许多在销路上、原料上、资金上的困难并使各业户从盲目地生产走到有计划地生产，便于政府指导与扶植工商业，因此，政府必须对各业情况有一详细的了解，这次办理重新普遍登记就是要达到这个目的。因此希望各厂家要认真确实填写，不要有任何顾虑。讲话中又着重地指出本市机器和金属冶制是有极远大的发展前途的。譬如慈型铁工厂初解放时只有十多个工人，最近由于销路逐渐打开，厂方积极经营与政府的扶植，已增加到五十多个工人，还在准备继续扩大生产就是一个例子。因为华北五千多万人口和广大的农村，正迫切地需要城市来帮助改良和供给大批农具，及其他工具、机器以发展农村生产，这个广大的市场是充满无限前途可以供机器工业发展的。他号召各较大的厂家，制定出自己的生产计划，按照计划进行生产，这样政府才便于指导，才便于帮助解决在生产中遇到的困难。他又号召把同业公会健全起来，对过去种种不合理的地方必须加以改革，所有会员对同业公会应积极推动监督，使之真正为工商业者服务，为大家办事情。只有有了组织以后，才便于替大家解决生产中的困难。最后由秘书主任石林同志对登记办法中的一些项目，逐项加以解释，主要的如关于资本一项，他解释说，表上所列固定资本，如厂房、土地、机器、设备，只要按现值折合人民币占价填明，流动资本是除去负债以外的资金和原料及存货等等，按市价八折计算填写，但是如果规模过小，如家庭工业，估计起来过于困难时，也可以不填，不过有机器设备和资金多少还是要填明白。大会至五时多始散会。
