　　Taiyue Telegram: Due to the colder climate this year compared to previous years, and a frost in Meng County in March, wheat in Suncun, Third District of the county, developed black jaundice. Village cadres Feng Fuxian and Tang Shihao first discovered it when they went to the fields. Knowing the seriousness of the problem, they quickly pulled out some wheat with black jaundice and took it to the village elementary school, distributing a handful to each student, and telling the children, "Go back and tell your families to check if the wheat in the fields has black jaundice. If it does, quickly pull out the affected wheat to prevent it from spreading." The students went back and told their families as instructed. The village cadres also took the lead in calling on the entire village to pull out the wheat with black jaundice. Under their promotion, they pulled for more than ten days from mid-April, removing the black jaundice from 127 mu of land. In areas where the black jaundice was severe, they pulled out a small bundle per mu. Now, the black jaundice is gone.

　　孟县孙村麦苗发生黑疸
    【太岳电】因今年气候比往年寒冷，三月间在孟县又下了一次霜，该县三区孙村麦子就生了黑疸病。村干部冯富先、汤士豪去地时首先发现，他们知道这个问题严重，就赶快拔回一些黑疸病麦子，拿到村中小学校里，给每个小学生一人分了一把，并告这些孩子说：“回去叫你们家里的大人，也到地里看看发生黑疸了没有，要是发生了，就赶快把生黑疸的麦子拔掉，防止传染。”小学生们回去照样向家里人说了，村干部又带头叫全村来拔黑疸麦子，在他们的推动下，从四月中旬一直拔了十几天，把一百二十七亩地的黑疸病麦都拔掉了。发生黑疸严重的，每亩就拔一小捆，现在黑疸已没有了。
