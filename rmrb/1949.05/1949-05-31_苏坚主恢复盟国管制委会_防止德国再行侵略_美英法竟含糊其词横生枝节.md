Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th: According to TASS Paris: On May 27th, the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers held its fifth meeting, chaired by French Foreign Minister Schuman, to continue discussing the issue of German unification.

Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky pointed out at the beginning of the meeting: Fundamentally, up to now, not a single delegation from the Western countries has put forward any constructive suggestions on the essence of the issues under discussion. For days, all we have heard here is one question after another. For example, Acheson said that everyone agrees to restore the Control Council, but he immediately raised the question: How will the Control Council operate? Will it be based on the principle of unanimous agreement or on majority voting? What will be the authority and power of the committee? And so on. This makes it difficult to solve the problem. It would be much easier if we had suitable conditions to judge the position of each delegation. But unfortunately, we still do not have such a document.

After Vyshinsky's speech, the representatives of the Western countries still avoided putting forward any specific suggestions, and largely repeated what they had said before.

Acheson reiterated that he did not think it possible to discuss and resolve the issue of four-power control until the economic issues of concern to the Western countries, such as reparations, etc., had been discussed. A large part of Acheson's speech criticized the principle of unanimous agreement, calling it an "outdated method of reaching international agreements." Acheson cited the Pan-American Union under US patronage as a desirable example. He pointed out that the alliance makes decisions by a two-thirds majority or a simple majority. When Acheson spoke of the Control Council's adoption of the principle of unanimous agreement, he tried to make it appear as if the issue was not an international one, as if the German issue was not of international importance.

French Foreign Minister Schuman's speech repeated what he said in the first few days of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Following Acheson's example, he insisted that economic issues be considered first. According to him, the answers to these questions "will be the determining factor in our final position." Schuman insisted that the Four-Power Control Council could only be organized after German unification had been achieved.

British Foreign Minister Bevin said he had nothing new to say.

Vyshinsky spoke again, saying that he could not agree that the question of German unification, how to organize Germany, how Germany would act in the future, and what this would lead to were not issues of international importance. Vyshinsky said that all peace-loving countries are very concerned about preventing Germany from re-aggression in the future, completing the task of eliminating German militarism, and Germany becoming a peace-loving and democratic country. All issues related to the German issue are important international issues. Regarding Acheson's statement that it is not clear what the Control Council is to control and what powers belong to the Control Council, Vyshinsky said: We are not now suggesting the establishment of this institution, but the restoration of this institution, which was established for a certain purpose but has not yet achieved this purpose. The working rules of the Control Council were formulated according to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. This document has been used in practice. Therefore, the questions raised by Acheson have long been resolved, and the Allied Control Regulations are there, and there is no need to bother solving this task that has already been solved. Vyshinsky also said that if the suggestion put forward at the meeting was to change certain powers of the Control Council, then the Soviet delegation would not object to discussing this issue. The possibility of transferring certain powers to German agencies can be considered, but the main role of the Control Council as the supreme authority must be maintained. Vyshinsky mentioned that Schuman insisted on first restoring German unification and then rebuilding the Four-Power Control, saying, I would like to make an analogy: When building a ship, the ship inspector gradually supervises everything during the construction process, long before the ship is completed and launched. If according to Schuman's statement, then a different approach is necessary: first build the ship, and then set up a ship inspector to check how the ship was built. Vyshinsky pointed out that all the prerequisites for the reconstruction of Allied control exist, the tasks and objectives of control are clear, and therefore, the point of contention is only the principle of unanimous agreement.

The last speaker at the meeting was Acheson, who said that the American delegation believed that now was the time to "study other issues." He explained that he was referring to "economic issues and the like."

　　苏坚主恢复盟国管制委会
  　防止德国再行侵略
    美英法竟含糊其词横生枝节
    【新华社北平二十九日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：五月二十七日，四国外长会议举行第五次会，由法外长舒曼任主席，继续讨论德国统一问题。
    苏外长维辛斯基在会议开始时指出：从根本上说来，到现在为止，没有一个西方国家代表团曾对讨论中的问题的本质提出过任何建设性的建议。几天以来，我们在这里所听到的一切东西，仅仅是向我们提出一个又一个问题。举例说，艾奇逊说，所有的人都同意恢复管制委员会，但他立刻就提出问题：管制委员会将怎样进行活动呢？是以一致协议原则为基础呢？还是以多数表决为基础呢？该委员会的权限和权力将如何呢？等等。这使解决问题很困难。如果我们有了适宜的条件，用这来判断各代表团的立场，那会容易得多。但是，我们不幸仍然没有这种文件。
    在维辛斯基发言之后，西方国家的代表仍然避免提出任何具体建议，而是在很大程度上重复了以前所说的东西。
    艾奇逊再度宣称：在讨论西方国家所关心的那些经济问题例如赔偿问题等等以前，他不认为有可能讨论和解决四国管制问题。艾奇逊演说的很大一部分批评一致协议原则，称之为“陈旧的达到国际协议的方法”。艾奇逊举了美国卵翼下的泛美联盟作为一个可取的范例。他指出，该联盟决定问题是按三分之二多数或过半数的办法。艾奇逊在谈到管制委员会之采用一致协议原则时，力图把问题说成好象并不是一个国际性问题的情形，好象德国问题没有国际的重要性。
    法外长舒曼的发言，重复他在外长会议最初几天中所说的东西。他仿照艾奇逊的榜样，坚持首先考虑经济性质的问题。照他说来，这些问题的答案，“将是决定我们最后立场的因素”。舒曼硬说，四国管制委员会只有在德国统一已经实现以后才能组织。
    英外长贝文说，他没有新的东西要说。
    维辛斯基再次发言说，他不能同意说德国统一、如何组织德国、德国今后如何行动以及这将导向什么等问题不是有国际重要性的问题。维辛斯基说，一切爱好和平的国家，都非常关心防止德国将来再行侵略，完成肃清德国军国主义的工作和德国成为一个爱好和平的民主国家。所有与德国问题有关的问题都是国际性的重要问题。关于艾奇逊所说，管委会要管制的到底是什么以及什么职权属于管委会都不清楚，维辛斯基说：我们现在不是建议建立这个机构，而是恢复这个为一定目的而设但远未达到这个目的的机构。管委会的工作条例是根据波茨坦协定的原则制定的。这一文件在实行中已被运用。因此，艾奇逊所提出的问题早就已经解决，盟国管制条例摆在那里，没有必要费脑筋去解决这一已经解决的任务。维辛斯基又说，如果会上所提出的建议是改变管委会的某些职权，那么，苏联代表团并不反对讨论这个问题。可以考虑把某些职权移交给德国机关的可能性，但是，管委会作为最高当局的主要作用必须保持。维辛斯基提到舒曼坚持首先恢复德国统一，然后重建四国管制时说，我愿作一譬喻：造船的时候，船舶监造员，逐步监督建筑过程中的每一件事情，远在船只建造完成和下水之前。如果照舒曼的说法，那么，就必需不同的做法：先把船造好，然后设一个船舶监造员来检查船是怎样造起来的。维辛斯基指出，重建盟国管制的一切先决条件都存在，管制的任务和目的是清清楚楚的，因此，争执点只是一致协议这个原则。
    会上最后一个发言的是艾奇逊，他说，美国代表团认为，现在是“研究其他问题”的时机了。他解释说，他指的是“经济问题之类”。
