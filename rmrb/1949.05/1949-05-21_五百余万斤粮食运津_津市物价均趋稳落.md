　　Over Five Million Jin of Grain Shipped to Tianjin
　　Prices in Tianjin Tend to Stabilize and Fall
　　[Report from this newspaper] A large quantity of grain purchased and shipped by the North China Trade Corporation from the Northeast began arriving in Tianjin on the 16th. As of the 19th, over 5.7 million jin of millet, corn, and grain have been transported, and some are still en route. In addition, grain from the grain-producing areas of eastern Hebei and Chahar-Suiyuan in North China is also being purchased and shipped to Tianjin by the Trade Corporation.

　　Furthermore, since the 19th, the markets for grain, yarn, and groceries in Tianjin have all shown a downward trend. The reasons, in addition to sufficient grain supply, are the cheaper prices in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, resulting in a large outflow of capital (it is reported that flour in Xuzhou is more than half the price of that in Tianjin). Furthermore, the banks are about to inspect funds, and loans are gradually tightening, so credit is tight. Moreover, merchants are acting cautiously. As Shanghai is about to be liberated, goods from the South can come north, and merchants are bearish on prices, resulting in fewer purchases. The demand from non-local grain merchants is also gradually decreasing, so prices continue to stabilize and fall.

　　五百余万斤粮食运津
  　津市物价均趋稳落
    【本报讯】华北贸易总公司自东北购运的大批粮食，十六日起陆续抵津，截至十九日止已运到小米、玉米、谷子等五百七十余万斤，还有一部正在转运途中。此外华北产粮区的冀东、察绥的粮食亦由贸易公司采购运津中。
    又自十九日起，津市粮食、纱布、杂货市场均呈下跌。原因除粮源充足外，系津浦南段物价便宜，资金大量外流（据悉，徐州面粉比津市约低一倍多）。又行庄即将检验资金，对外放款逐渐紧缩，故银根呈紧。且各商户力持谨慎，上海即将解放，南货已能北来，商人对物价均看跌，购买稀少，外帮粮商需要亦渐减，故物价续趋稳落。
