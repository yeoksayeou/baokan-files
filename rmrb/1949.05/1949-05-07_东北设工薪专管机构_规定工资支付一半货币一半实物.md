Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: The Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated a decision on establishing a special agency for wages and salaries on the 28th of last month. The decision stipulates that all enterprise departments in the Northeast, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee, and all Northeast level financial and economic departments and their subordinate bureaus, factories, provinces, cities, and their enterprise departments must establish special wage and salary organs. These organs will be responsible for handling wage and salary matters, and will be responsible for supervising, guiding, and inspecting the implementation of wage payment policies by relevant state-owned stores and employee cooperatives. The establishment of special wage and salary agencies will guarantee the livelihoods of workers and enable the leading bodies of various enterprises to concentrate their efforts on economic construction. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has also decided to add a wage department to trade unions at all levels to help resolve various problems that currently exist in wages. Its specific tasks are to study wage standards, technical standards, various wage systems, and payment methods, and to offer opinions to responsible administrative personnel in relevant government departments, to ensure the correct implementation of government regulations concerning wages, and to reflect workers' opinions at any time.

Furthermore, the Northeast Administrative Committee issued instructions on the 28th of last month to revise the wage payment methods. The instructions stipulate that 50 percent of the worker's earned wage should be paid in currency, and 50 percent should be paid in in-kind wage vouchers. After receiving the wage vouchers, workers can use them to purchase five kinds of goods – grain, cloth, oil, salt, and coal – at state-owned stores or employee cooperatives in their area, or they can use them at a discounted price to buy other goods. The instructions also task the Ministry of Commerce with establishing state-owned stores in various mines and large and medium-sized cities by the beginning of this month, according to the industrial system, and with assisting various enterprises in establishing employee cooperatives. At the same time, various enterprise organs and their subordinate units should also help workers establish employee consumer cooperatives.
