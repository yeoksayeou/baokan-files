Trafficking Fake Currency and Spying for Military Intelligence
  Shijiazhuang Two Special Agents Executed
    [Shijiazhuang, 16th Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, the Shijiazhuang People's Court executed two special agent dogs who disrupted financial order. One, Cheng Shuang, was a cart pusher; the other, Han Jintang, was a small merchant who ran to Beiping. These two criminals went to Beiping under the guise of doing business on July 1st last year and colluded with Wu Jicheng (also known as Wu Wei), a staff officer and team leader in the Second Department of the Beiping National Defense Ministry of the Chiang gang (the person responsible for sending fake currency to the liberated areas along the Ping-Bao line). They conspired to traffic fake currency to Shijiazhuang to acquire supplies. On October 27th last year, the first batch of 70 million yuan in fake border currency was transported, using 206 light bulbs, one pound of quinine, and four bottles of "Nitric Acid Stone Drops" as cover. They also accepted special agent tasks, spying on our military intelligence along the Ping-Bao line, investigating the effectiveness of bandit aircraft bombing Shijiazhuang, and bringing back four bottles of poison. After the two criminals returned to Shijiazhuang, they released more than 50 million yuan within three days and acquired four taels and one mace of gold and some supplies. On the 23rd of the same month, they were discovered by our Public Security Bureau and immediately arrested, and evidence such as fake currency and poison were seized. After investigation and interrogation by the People's Court in June, it was determined that the two criminals had received special agent missions, trafficked fake currency, disrupted financial order, stolen supplies, spied on military intelligence, and plotted to release poison, which was a heinous crime and unforgivable. They were immediately sentenced to capital punishment according to the law. With the approval of the North China People's Government, the execution was carried out yesterday.

    【石家庄十六日电】十五日下午，石家庄人民法院枪决扰乱金融特务犯两狗。一名程双以名跑合为业，一名韩金堂系跑北平小商。该两犯去年七月一日以经商为名赴北平，与蒋匪北平国防部第二厅参谋兼组长吴继成（即吴为，是平保线向解放区发假票的负责人）合谋，向石市倒运假票套购物资。去年十月廿七日，首批运来假边币七千万元，用二百零六个灯泡及奎一磅、“硝酸石滴年”四瓶作掩护，并接受特务任务，剌探平保线我方军情，调查匪机轰炸石市效果，同时携回毒药四瓶。该两犯回到石市后，三日内即推出五千余万元，并套购黄金四两一钱及物资一部。同月二十三日即被我公安局发觉，立即逮捕，搜出假票毒药等证据。经人民法院六月来调查审讯，认为该两犯受领特务任务，倒运假票，扰乱金融，盗取物资，刺探军情，阴谋放毒，实为罪大恶极，无可宽大。当即依法判处列刑。经华北人民政府批准已于十五日执行枪决。
