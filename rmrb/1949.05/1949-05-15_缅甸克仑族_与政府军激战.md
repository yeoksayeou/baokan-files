Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Reports from various sources: The war between the Karen people in Burma and the government troops has recently intensified, with the center of the fighting being northeast of Rangoon. A Burmese government public statement on the 7th stated: On the fifteen-mile front between the railway city of Nyaunglebin and Taungoo, northeast of Rangoon, Burmese government troops and Karen troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The Karen people concentrated several thousand troops in late April, moving south from the Sino-Burmese border, and in early May reached a point seventy miles northeast of Rangoon. Simultaneously with the northern route, another Karen force west of Rangoon reorganized its battle lines around Moulmein, engaging in fierce fighting with Burmese government troops. The Karen troops besieged in the Insein area, ten miles north of Rangoon, continued to resist attacks by the Burmese government's navy and air force.
