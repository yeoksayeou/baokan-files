    The People of Xiaoshan
    Welcome Our Army Advancing South
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 14th] The People's Liberation Army, which crossed the Qiantang River south of Hangzhou to pursue and annihilate fleeing enemies, was warmly welcomed by the people of Xiaoshan City. When the PLA arrived in the city on the 5th, railway workers, students, and people from all walks of life rushed to the bus station and streets to form welcoming lines, shouting welcome slogans, and welcome slogans were posted everywhere on the walls. Workers at the railway machinery factory organized a patrol team to protect the factory before the PLA arrived. They nailed the factory doors shut to prevent looting and destruction by the bandit troops. The day after the PLA arrived, despite enemy planes constantly circling overhead, they began preparations for resuming work. Tian Qingcheng, a worker who was transferred to the factory last year from the Jinpu Railway Machinery Factory, told reporters: "I was very distressed to see the Kuomintang bandit troops destroy the bridges on the Jinpu Railway, so we did everything we could to protect the factory intact and hand it over to our own troops." Students at Xianghu Normal School also organized a patrol team in advance to protect the school and listened to Xinhua News Agency broadcasts to spread the news of the PLA's progress to the citizens. After liberation, they immediately reported to the PLA when they found ammunition left behind by the Kuomintang bandit troops at the railway station and other places.

    萧山人民
    欢迎南进我军
    【新华社杭州十四日电】由杭州南渡钱塘江追歼逃敌的人民解放军，受到萧山城人民的热烈欢迎。当解放军于五日抵达该城时，铁路工人、青年学生及各界市民赶赴汽车站及街道上列队欢迎，高呼欢迎口号，墙壁上到处贴着欢迎标语。铁路机械工厂的工人们在解放军到达之前即组织了纠察队，负责保护工厂。把工厂门钉死，防止匪军抢劫破坏。解放军到达的第二天，虽敌机不断在上空盘旋，他们即开始准备复工。去年从津浦铁路机械工厂调来该厂的工人田庆成对记者说：“我看到国民党匪军破坏津浦铁路的桥梁，非常痛心，所以我们尽了一切力量，把工厂完好的保护下来交给我们自己的队伍。”湘湖师范的学生，也事先组织了纠察队，保护学校，并收听新华社广播，把解放军进展的消息，传告市民。解放后，他们在火车站等处发见国民党匪军遗留下的弹药时，立即报告了解放军。
