Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS, London - The strike by Canadian sailors around the world against shipowners' attempts to reduce wages and working conditions continues. On seven ships in Britain, a total of 320 Canadian sailors are participating in the strike. The striking workers on the "Beaverbrae" were warmly welcomed by workers and their families in London's East End. Two hundred worker families have vacated rooms to accommodate the Canadian sailors who have come ashore, and rudder workers and tugboat workers have pledged not to allow the ship to leave the Thames. In Bombay, 31 striking sailors have been arrested. Similar arrests have occurred in some other countries. Davis, Chairman of the Canadian Seamen's Union, declared at a press conference in London: Canadian sailors will never yield to the tyrannical measures aimed at undermining the worldwide strike of Canadian sailors. All members of the Canadian Seamen's Union have united to defeat any efforts by shipowners to cut wages and lower working conditions.

　　加拿大海员坚持世界性罢工
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：加拿大海员在全世界各地所进行的反对船主企图减低工资及工作条件的罢工，仍在继续中。在英国的七艘船只上共有三百二十名加海员参加罢工。“比物勃鲁尔”号船上罢工的工人，受到伦敦东区工人和工人家属的热情欢迎，已有二百家工人腾出房子给上岸的加拿大海员工人住宿，船舵工人和拖船工人则保证不让该船离开泰晤士河。在孟买，已有三十一位罢工的海员被捕。其他某些国家内也有同样逮捕事件发生。加海员工会主席台维斯在伦敦记者招待会上宣称：加拿大海员决不屈服于企图破坏加拿大海员世界性罢工的暴虐手段。加拿大海员工会全体会员已团结起来，要击败船主企图消减工资及降低工作条件的任何努力。
