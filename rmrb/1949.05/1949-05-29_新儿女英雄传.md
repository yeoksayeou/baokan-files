Chapter Two: The Communist Party (Continued 1)

Liu Shuangxi saw that DaShui was very active in fighting the flood, and wanted to absorb him into the Communist Party. One day in the late afternoon, Shuangxi came to DaShui and said, "Are you busy? Let's go pick up some firewood." DaShui said, "Okay, let's go." So he took a small sickle and a rope, and the two of them went out of the village together.

They picked up some corn stubble and sorghum stalks in the field, and then went to a small reed field. Shuangxi looked around to make sure no one was there, and while cutting reeds, he said, "DaShui, do you think we can win against the Japanese?" DaShui said, "Of course, we can." Shuangxi asked, "Are you afraid of fighting the Japanese?" DaShui said, "What's there to be afraid of!" Shuangxi asked again, "DaShui, who do you think is leading us in fighting the Japanese?" DaShui thought to himself, "This guy is weird! Why does he keep asking me?" He blurted out, "Isn't it Hei Lao Cai!" Shuangxi laughed, "Do you know who Hei Lao Cai is?" DaShui said blankly, "Isn't he my cousin?" Shuangxi thought helplessly, "Oh, this guy, there's no way to deal with him!"

The two of them cut for a while, and Shuangxi said in a low voice again, "DaShui, I'm asking you, do you think it will be good to implement communism in the future?" DaShui said stupidly, "Communism, will it communize my land? I still have five mu of land!" Shuangxi straightened his back, pointed at him with the small sickle, and said, "You idiot! What would we do with your five mu of land?" DaShui was still cutting, Shuangxi said angrily, "Stop cutting, let's go!" The two of them carried the firewood on their backs and returned in silence. Niu DaShui returned home, pondering back and forth, "What does Shuangxi mean by telling me these things?" His mind kept churning.

One night, it was Gao Tun'er's turn to stand guard. Gao Tun'er came to call Niu DaShui, "Keep me company." DaShui took a土枪 (crude homemade gun) and went with him to the village entrance. The two of them climbed into a sorghum stalk pile and chatted for a while; Gao Tun'er said, "Brother DaShui, you are a very solid person, but you are too 死巴 (stubborn)... Has anyone introduced you to join yet?" DaShui couldn't figure out what was going on, and said, "Join what?" Gao Tun'er said anxiously, "See, you won't say it! Didn't Shuangxi talk to you about it?" DaShui said, "He didn't tell me anything!" Gao Tun'er was worried, thinking, "This kid is really confused! He is Shuangxi's 'object!' People don't want me to talk to him about it, what should I do?" DaShui suddenly remembered and shouted, "Oh! Is it asking me to join the Communist Party?" Gao Tun'er quickly pulled him, saying, "What are you shouting! It would be bad if people heard you!"

DaShui asked in a low voice, "Tun'er, if I'm in the Party, will I still farm?" Gao Tun'er said, "Of course! If farmers don't farm, what will we eat?" DaShui said, "Then I'll join too. Are you in the Party?" Gao Tun'er's throat was itchy, wanting to say yes but not daring to, so he said vaguely, "I am... damn it, let's look for it! If I find it, I'll tell you, if you find it, tell me." DaShui said, "Okay, let's do that." After the midnight shift change, DaShui quietly said to Gao Tun'er, "If you find the doorway, don't forget me!" Gao Tun'er smiled and agreed, and the two parted ways.

After that, DaShui was always looking forward to news from Gao Tun'er, but Gao Tun'er never mentioned it to him; DaShui was too embarrassed to ask, which really frustrated him. He went to find Shuangxi, and found Shuangxi, Gao Tun'er, and two or three other farmers, whispering something in secret, as if they were having a meeting. When they saw him coming, they brushed him aside. DaShui thought, "Why are they treating me like an outsider? ...The more I live, the less I am worth!" He was so angry that he wanted to cry. --This went on for more than half a month.

One night, Liu Shuangxi led the militia to the west to break the road and dig ditches. On the way, everyone enthusiastically sang:

The moon hangs curved on the treetop,
Shoulder the iron pickaxe, carry the hoe,
Go out of the village to destroy the highway,
So that the Japanese devils
Can't transport troops to kill and burn!
De'er sheng, de'er sheng,
De'er sheng de sheng de sheng...

When they arrived at the highway, Shuangxi first sent out sentries, and then divided the people into sections. Everyone scattered and started digging. Groups competed with groups, and individuals competed with individuals. Whoever dug the most got to sit in an airplane; whoever dug the least became a turtle. Everyone worked hard.

Niu DaShui worked very hard. It was already cold, and as he worked, he took off his coat and threw it aside. Bare-chested, he swung a pickaxe with all his might, digging more than ten zhang by himself, surpassing Gao Tun'er. On the way back, he carried a telephone pole with a coil of iron wire attached to it. Shuangxi walked beside him, also bent over by the weight of the iron pickaxe, iron hoe, and iron wire. The two of them lagged behind.

Halfway there, they put down their things and sat down in the bright moonlight to rest. Shuangxi wiped his sweat and said comically, "Oh my goodness! I'm so squeezed, I'm sweating oil." DaShui puffed on his旱烟管儿 (dry tobacco pipe) and said, "Ha, now we have firewood. Let's split this telephone pole when we get back and boil water to drink!" Shuangxi said, "DaShui, you put your heart into everything you do, you are really 不赖歹 (truly excellent)!" DaShui said dejectedly, "I'm not good! I'm 矬 (shorter/inferior) than others by a notch!" Shuangxi heard that there was more to his words, so he asked him. DaShui said, "If I weren't shorter by a notch, how could I not be in the Party?" Shuangxi asked with a smile, "Do you know what the Communist Party does?" DaShui said, "How could I not know! The Communist Party is for resisting Japan." Shuangxi asked, "What else do they do?" DaShui said, "They also lead us to reduce rent, so that we poor brothers also have food to eat." Shuangxi smiled and said, "That's right, the Communist Party wants everyone to have clothes to wear, food to eat, books to read, and happiness to enjoy." DaShui said, "I just feel in my heart that the Communist Party is good!" Saying that, he handed the pipe to Shuangxi.

Shuangxi smoked and asked, "Who do you think is a Communist in our village?" DaShui said, "Hey, this is as clear as can be, no need to ask, I think you are!" Shuangxi smiled and said nothing. DaShui pulled him and said, "Brother Shuangxi, don't make it difficult for me. The stars follow the moon; I will follow you to learn, whatever you do, I will do; anyway, I know you are always doing good things!" Shuangxi comforted him, "DaShui, don't worry! The Communist Party cherishes workers and farmers like us the most. We have already had a meeting and decided to let you join." DaShui jumped up with joy, "Are you really letting me join?" Shuangxi said, "Keep your voice down! This matter must be kept secret; don't tell your parents above, don't tell your wife below, no one can know." DaShui repeatedly agreed.

DaShui returned home, he was as happy as if he had obtained a treasure, constantly smiling. His father asked him, "What are you so happy about?" DaShui smiled and said, "Nothing to be happy about, just…... feeling happy in my heart!"

The next day, Shuangxi called DaShui to attend a group meeting, Gao Tun'er and the others were already waiting. Gao Tun'er pulled DaShui to sit on the kang, patted him and said, "Now you are a Communist Party member." DaShui happily pointed at him and said, "Heh, you even told me to find it for you, you were pretending so well!" Shuangxi said, "Let's talk seriously, DaShui, now that you are in the Party, you must abide by discipline and obey the Party's resolutions!" DaShui said, "Okay, I'll do whatever you tell me to do." Gao Tun'er said, "He joined us here, with one heart." Everyone said, "DaShui can't be wrong." Shuangxi said, "DaShui is good; but he still has 'peasant consciousness', which must be overcome." DaShui didn't understand what "peasant consciousness" was, he asked them, and everyone discussed it in their own way.

After the meeting, DaShui went home and heard his father say that Yang Xiaomei had been beaten and had come to her sister's house. The old man shook his head and sighed, "Alas, such a good girl, falling into their hands, it's really that the heavens have no eyes!" DaShui said angrily, "People have money!" Brother Xiaoshui said, "Brother, let's go see her, she's been very good to us." DaShui said, "I'm not going, let it be however it is!" DaShui smoked a pipe of tobacco, but unknowingly went to his cousin's house.

Xiaomei was helping her sister wash pots and dishes. In the lamplight, DaShui saw Xiaomei's back view, but didn't know where she had been beaten. The cousin said to DaShui, "My mother is really blind, marrying Xiaomei into such a family, all they do is scold and beat! Her mother-in-law herself forgot where she hid the matches, and Xiaomei spent a few coppers to buy a box of matches for cooking, and she caught her for it, and insisted on making her eat the matches! She even picked up a rolling pin and beat her over the head. Look!" She pulled Xiaomei and said, "Let your brother see!" Xiaomei brushed her sister's hand away, turned her body away, lowered her head, and sobbed. The cousin said, "Hey! Her head has a hole in it, bleeding non-stop; a big blue bump was beaten on her eyebrow bone, almost blinding her eyes!"

[Note] ①不赖歹: means really good. ②矬: means short. (Attached pictures)

DaShui: "Communism, will it communize my land? I still have five mu of land!"
Shuangxi: "You idiot! What would we do with your five mu of land?"
Gao Tun'er pulled Niu DaShui:
"Now you are a Communist Party member!"
Xiaomei was beaten and went to her sister's house, wanting to become a "Red Army woman."

    第二回  共产党（续一）
    刘双喜看大水很积极，想吸收他加入共产党。有一天后半晌，双喜来找大水说：“你有事不？咱俩去拾点柴禾吧。”大水说：“行，咱们走吧。”就拿上小镰，带上绳子，两个人一块儿出村。
    他俩在野地里拾了一些棒子槎、高梁秸，又到一片小苇子地。双喜看看四面没人，就一面割苇子，一面说：“大水，你看咱们打日本将来能打胜不能？”大水说：“能哇。”双喜问：“打日本你害怕不？”大水说：“怕什么！”双喜又问：“大水，你说咱们打日本是什么人领导的？”大水心里想：“这个人真怪！怎么老问我呀？”就冲口说：“还不是黑老蔡啊！”双喜笑起来：“你知道黑老蔡是什么人？”大水楞头楞脑的说：“他不是我表哥吗？”双喜没奈何的想：“唉，这个人，真没办法！”
    两个人又割了一会儿，双喜又低声说：“大水，我问你，将来实行共产主义你看好不好？”大水傻不济济的说：“共产，共我的地不？我还有五亩地呀！”双喜直了腰，用小镰子点着他说：“你这个傻蛋！共你那五亩地干什么呀？”大水还在割，双喜气恼的说：“别割了，咱们走吧！”两个人背着柴禾，不言不语的回来了。牛大水回到家里，来回寻思：“双喜找我说这些，是什么意思呀？”心里老是转磨不开。
    一天晚上，轮着高屯儿站岗。高屯儿来叫牛大水：“跟我作个伴儿吧。”大水拿个土枪，跟他到了村口。两个爬在秫秸垛里，说了一阵闲话；高屯儿就说：“大水哥，你这个人挺实牢，就是太死巴……有人介绍你参加了没？”大水摸不清是什么事，说：“参加什么呀？”高屯儿着急的说：“你看你又不说！双喜不是跟你谈过了？”大水说：“他没给我说什么呀！”高屯儿急坏了，心里想：“这小子，真他妈的糊涂！他是双喜的‘对象！’人家又不叫我跟他说，这可怎么着？”大水忽然想起来，嚷着说：“哦！是不是叫我参加共产党？”高屯儿忙拉他一把，说：“嚷什么！给人听见可坏啦！”
    大水小声问：“屯儿，在了党，我还种地不？”高屯儿说：“种哇！庄稼人不种地，吃什么呀？”大水说：“那我也参加吧。你是不是在了党啦？”高屯儿喉咙里挺痒痒，想说是又不敢说是，就含含糊糊的说：“我是……他妈的，咱们找吧！我找着告诉你，你找着告诉我。”大水说：“行，就这么吧。”半夜换岗以后，大水悄悄跟高屯儿说：“你找着门头，可别忘了我！”高屯儿笑着答应，两个人就分手了。
    以后，大水老盼着高屯儿那边的信息，高屯儿可老不跟他提这个岔儿；大水又不好问，真把他蹩坏啦。他去找双喜，发现双喜高屯儿和另外两三个农民，背地里咕咕什么，象是开会呢，见他来了，就把他支开。大水想：“怎么把我当外人看待呢？……这可是越活越不如人啦！”气得他尽想啼哭。--这么着，直至了半个多月。
    有一天晚上，刘双喜带着自卫队到西边去破路，挖道沟。一路上大伙儿起劲的唱：
    月儿弯弯挂树梢，
    背起铁铣扛起了镐，
    出得村去破坏汽道，
    免得那鬼子儿兵
    运兵来杀烧！
    得儿生，得儿生，
    得儿生得生得生……
    到了公路上，双喜先派出警戒哨，又给人们分了段，大伙儿散开，就挖起来。小组跟小组竞赛，个人跟个人竞赛。谁挖的多，谁就坐飞机；谁挖的少，谁就当乌龟。人们都紧张的干起来了。
    牛大水很费力气。天已经冷了，他干着干着就把袄儿脱下一扔，光着膀子，拿个镐，一股劲的抡，一个人挖了一丈多，把高屯儿也比去下了。回来的时候，他扛着一根电线杆，电线杆上还套着一盘铁丝。双喜走在他的旁边，也给铁镐、铁铣、铁丝压得弯了腰，两个人落在后面了。
    半路上，他俩放下东西，在明光月亮地坐下来歇一歇。双喜擦着汗，滑稽的说：“啊呀，我的乖乖！可把我压出油来了。”大水抽着旱烟管儿，说：“哈，这下可有了柴禾啦。回去把这电线杆子劈了，咱们烧水喝！”双喜说：“大水，你干什么都上劲，你真是不赖歹啊①！”大水丧气的说：“咱不行！咱比人家矬着一截呢②！”双喜听他话里有话，就问他。大水说：“我要不矬一截，怎么就不能在党呢？”双喜笑着问：“你知道共产党是干什么的？”大水说：“那还不知道！共产党是抗日的么。”双喜问：“还干些什么。”大水说：“还领导咱们减租子，叫咱穷哥们也有饭吃。”双喜笑了一笑，说：“对着咧，共产党要叫人人有衣穿，有饭吃，有书念，还要有福享呢。”大水说：“我就是心眼儿里觉着共产党好！”说着把烟管儿递给双喜。
    双喜抽着烟问：“你看咱村谁是共产党？”大水说：“嗨，这可是亲上包亲，不用打听，我看你就是！”双喜笑着不言语。大水拉着他说：“双喜哥，你们别这么蹩我啦。星星跟着月亮走；我就跟着你们学，你们怎么着，我也怎么着；反正我知道你们尽干的好事儿！”双喜就安慰他：“大水，你别着急！共产党最稀罕咱们这样的工人农民。我们已经开过会，决定让你参加了。”大水喜得跳起来：“真是让我参加啦？”双喜说：“你小声些！这事儿可得保守秘密；上不传父母，下不传妻子，谁也不能给知道。”大水连连答应。
    大水回到家里，他象得了宝贝似的，尽嘻着嘴笑。他爹问他：“你乐什么呀？”大水笑着说：“不乐什么，就是………心眼儿里才痛快！”
    第二天，双喜叫大水去开小组会，高屯儿他们早等着了。高屯儿拉大水坐在坑上，拍着他说：“这你可成了共产党员啦。”大水快活的指着他说：“嘻，你还叫我给你找，你倒装得象呀！”双喜说：“咱们说正经的，大水，你在了党，可得遵守纪律，服从党的决议啊！”大水说：“行喽，叫我干什么我就干什么。”高屯儿说：“他参加我们这里头，准一个心。”旁人都说：“大水可错不了。”双喜说：“大水是不错；就是还有‘农民意识’，可得好好儿克服。”大水不懂，什么叫“农民意识”，他问他们，大伙儿就你一言、我一语的讨论开了。
    四
    散了会，大水回家，听他爹说，杨小梅挨了打，到她姐姐家来了。老爹摇着头，叹气说：“唉，这么好的闺女，落到他们手里，真是老天爷不睁眼！”大水气鼓鼓的说：“人家有钱啊！”兄弟小水说：“哥，咱们去看看她吧，人家对咱们挺好的。”大水说：“我才不去呢，爱怎么就怎么吧！”大水抽了一锅烟，可不知不觉的到他表嫂家去了。
    小梅正在帮她姐姐刷锅洗碗呢，灯光里，大水看见小梅的后影儿，可不知道她给打在哪儿了。表嫂对大水说：“我娘真是瞎了眼，把小梅嫁给这么个人家，不是骂，就是打！她婆婆自个儿忘记把洋火藏在哪儿了，小梅作饭，花了几个子儿买了一盒洋火，这就犯在她手里啦，非叫他吃了洋火不行！还拿起赶杖，兜头盖脸一顿打。你看！”他拉拉小梅说：“给大哥瞧！”小梅拌开姐姐的手扭过身去，低下头，抽抽噎噎的哭。表嫂说：“嗨！头上顿了个窟窿，直流血；眉骨头上打了老大一个青疙瘩，差点儿把眼睛都打瞎了！”
    【注】①不赖歹：真好的意思。②矬：就是矮。（附图片）
    大水说：“共产，共我的地不？我还有五亩地呀！”
    双喜说：“你这个傻蛋！共你那五亩地干吗呀？”
    高屯儿拉着牛大水说：
    “你可成了共产党员啦！”
    小梅挨了打，到姐姐家，要当“女红军”去。
