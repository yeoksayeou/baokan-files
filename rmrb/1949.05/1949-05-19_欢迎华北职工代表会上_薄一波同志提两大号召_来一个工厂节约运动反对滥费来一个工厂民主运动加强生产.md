　　Welcome Reception for North China Worker Representatives
  　Comrade Bo Yibo Issues Two Major Calls
    Launch a Factory Conservation Movement to Oppose Waste; Launch a Factory Democracy Movement to Strengthen Production
    [Reported by this newspaper] To welcome the North China worker representatives who have newly arrived in Beiping from Tianjin, and to clarify the current situation and several important issues in the current North China workers' movement, the North China Bureau of the CCP specially convened a grand meeting yesterday (the 18th). Attending were all the North China worker representatives, several worker training classes in Beiping, and nearly two thousand workers from public enterprises in Beiping City. Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP, Comrade Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, and General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region, all personally attended and gave speeches. The meeting began at 9:00 AM. After Comrade Xiao Ming of the Beiping City Federation of Trade Unions reported on the significance of the meeting, Comrade Bo Yibo addressed the audience. He first explained that this North China Worker Representatives' Conference was very well-organized. The North China Bureau believed that the draft implementation regulations on establishing factory management committees and factory worker representative meetings in state-owned and public enterprises, the draft resolutions on concluding collective contracts for state-owned and public enterprises in North China, the draft outline for collective contracts, and the conference's several suggestions to the North China People's Government were all very good in principle. However, in order to make them even more perfect, it was proposed that they be printed and distributed to various regions and factories as drafts for trial implementation first, and then widely discussed, before being finalized. After discussion by the North China People's Government, they will be prepared as laws and regulations for publication. To achieve the goal of relying on all workers to run factories well, in order to develop production and prosper the economy, the promulgation of these documents is timely and necessary. Then, based on Chairman Mao's instructions, Comrade Yibo gave a more detailed analysis of the current revolutionary situation in China and answered some comrades' questions: "Does the Kuomintang still have the ability to counterattack?" "Are we overly stimulating the United States? Are we not afraid that the United States will continue to help Chiang Kai-shek fight us?" "What is the British reaction after we attacked the British imperialist warships that blocked our crossing of the Yangtze River?" Comrade Yibo used Chairman Mao's past instructions to answer these questions. The main force of the Kuomintang has basically been eliminated by the People's Liberation Army, and it has already disintegrated and cannot carry out any counterattacks. The United States has always helped Chiang Kai-shek, not because we stimulated him; it would help him even without stimulation. But there is precisely another situation: the greater the strength of the People's Liberation Army, the greater the strength of the Chinese people's unity, the more the United States will have to consider helping Chiang Kai-shek, and the less daring it will be to act recklessly. This has been proven by the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. After the People's Liberation Army resisted the British imperialist warships, British imperialism had no reaction and did not make any so-called "protests," etc.
    In the second part of his speech, Comrade Yibo made two major calls to the representatives present regarding the current workers' movement in North China: (1) A strict conservation movement should be launched in North China's industrial production. Comrade Yibo pointed out that in the past, North China workers made great contributions to supporting the war, but future tasks will be even more arduous. It is not easy to transform an agricultural country into an industrial country. In the past, there were serious wasteful phenomena in our industrial construction and in factories. The calculation of labor and materials was extremely inaccurate. Often, the emphasis was on reducing labor without paying attention to saving raw materials, or only paying attention to saving valuable raw materials without paying attention to saving large quantities of commonly used raw materials. Labor organization was unscientific, and production was uneconomical. Technical level was low, tools were poor, scrap rate was high, and technical mastery was inaccurate, resulting in large discrepancies in material consumption. Factory construction lacked planning, and the placement of production departments was inappropriate, increasing waste and poor production coordination, resulting in uncoordinated phenomena. For example, if one department reduces production, other departments will stop working. Production is mostly characterized by shock work, not regular, with alternating periods of slack and urgency, resulting in large waste. There is great blindness in management, as well as departmentalism and a purely profit-oriented viewpoint. They are separated from each other, each acting on its own. Factories do not care about the source of raw materials and the cost outlet, but only produce blindly. Therefore, it is proposed that an anti-waste and conservation movement be launched in all factories. Savings should be made in raw materials, fuel, machinery, and all other aspects, and the fight against waste should be waged to reduce costs and increase output as much as possible. Worker comrades should regard the factory as their own. All Party branches, Communist Youth League branches, and trade unions should study how to conserve, and a movement should be formed in improving quality, increasing quantity, reducing waste, and reducing costs. This will be of great significance to the restoration and development of production. (2) A democratization movement should be launched in all factories, especially in factories in the old liberated areas. Democracy should be implemented in an organized and led manner, and criticism and self-criticism should be conducted. There is bureaucracy, waste, and corruption in factories. Mobilize everyone to expose these dark sides, offer opinions, and conduct criticism and self-examination, with everyone saying what they know, saying it without reservation, and those who speak are not to be blamed, and those who hear are to be warned. It is permissible to criticize factory directors, managers, and staff, and factory directors, managers, and staff are not allowed to retaliate. If there are faults, they should be corrected; if there are none, they should be encouraged. Cadres can also be nominated and employed after approval by higher authorities. This will be of great help to the factory, but the method of implementation should be carefully considered. First, communicate with the factory directors, managers, and staff, and then convene a general meeting for criticism, so that the leaders are not put in an untenable position. It can also be carried out by using worker representative meetings, branch meetings, and Communist Youth League member meetings. Factory management committees must be established uniformly. Comrade Yibo pointed out: all issues must be brought to the factory management committee for study. The factory management committee is the highest authority in the factory, but this does not contradict the system of factory director responsibility. The factory director still has the final decision-making power, but the factory director should not always use this final decision-making power. This is beneficial to production. In addition, Comrade Yibo explained the issues of collecting worker income tax, the government establishing a labor bureau, and the workers' wartime burden.

　　欢迎华北职工代表会上
  　薄一波同志提两大号召
    来一个工厂节约运动反对滥费来一个工厂民主运动加强生产
    【本报讯】为了欢迎新由津抵平的华北职工代表，阐明目前形势及当前华北职工运动中的几个重要问题，中共中央华北局于昨（十八）日特召集隆重会议，计到有华北职工代表全体、北平的几个职工训练班，以及平市各公营企业职工近两千人，中共中央华北局书记薄一波同志、华北人民政府董必武主席、华北军区司令员聂荣臻将军均亲临讲话。会议于上午九时开始，北平市总工会萧明同志报告开会意义之后，由薄一波同志向大家讲话。他首先说明，这次华北职工代表会议开的很好，关于国营公营企业中建立工厂管理委员会、与工厂职工代表会议的实施条例草案、关于华北国营公营企业订立集体合同的决议草案、集体合同纲要草案，以及大会向华北人民政府的几项建议，华北局认为原则上都是很好的，但为了更加完善起见，提议先行印发各地各工厂先以草案试行，并广泛讨论，然后制成定案，华北人民政府讨论后，并准备制成法令条例发表。为了达到依靠全体职工把工厂办好，以便发展生产繁荣经济，这几个文件的颁布是适时的必要的。接着，一波同志根据毛主席的指示，对目前中国的革命形势作了较详细的分析。并解答了某些同志的疑问：“国民党还有反攻的能力么”？“我们过分刺激美国，不怕美国继续援助蒋介石打我们么”？“我们打击了阻我渡江的英帝国主义兵舰，英国反响如何”？一波同志均用毛主席的历次指示作了解答，国民党的主力已经基本上被人民解放军消灭，他已经分崩离析，不可能进行什么反攻了。美国从来是帮助蒋介石的，不是因为我们刺激了他，不刺激也要帮助的，但恰恰有另一种情况，人民解放军的力量愈大，中国人民团结的力量愈大，美国帮助蒋介石就越要加以考虑，越不敢放肆，这已由中国人民革命斗争所证明。在人民解放军抗击了英帝国主义兵舰后，英帝国主义并无什么反响，亦未提出所谓“抗议”等等。
    一波同志在讲话的第二部分中对华北当前的职工运动向到会代表提出两大号召：（一）在华北的工业生产中，要来一个严格的节约运动。一波同志指出，过去在支持战争上，华北职工曾有过伟大的贡献，但今后的任务将更加艰巨，要把农业国变为工业国是不容易的。过去我们在工业建设上，在工厂中存在着严重的滥费现象，用工用料计算极不精确，往往强调减工而不注重节省原料，或仅注意节省贵重的原料而不注意节省大量使用的普遍原料。劳动组织不科学，生产不经济。技术水平低，工具差，报废率高，技术掌握不准确，用料悬殊因而也很大。建设工厂计划性不够，生产部门位置安排不恰当，增加滥费、生产搭配不好，有不协调现象。如因一部门减产其他部门停工。生产大多带突击性，不经常，一松一紧，滥费大。在经营上存在极大盲目性，本位主义单纯营利观点。彼此分离各自为政，工厂不管原料来源和成本出路，只是盲目地生产。因此，提议在所有工厂中来一个反对滥费，力求节约的运动。在原料、燃料、机器，各方面都要进行节约，与滥费作斗争，尽量降低成本提高产量。工人同志们应该把工厂看成是自己的，所有党的支部、团的支部、工会都应该研究如何节约，在提高质量、增多数量、减少浪费、减低成本方面，要形成一个运动。这对恢复和发展生产将是有重要意义的。（二）在各工厂特别老解放区工厂来一个民主化运动，有组织地、有领导地实行民主，进行批评和自我批评。工厂中有官僚主义，有滥费现象，也有贪污腐化行为，发动所有的人来揭露这些黑暗面，提意见，实行批评检讨，也是知无不言，言无不尽，言者无罪，闻者足戒，可以批评厂长经理职员，不许厂长经理职员报复，有则改之，无则加勉。并可以推选干部，经上级批准后加以录用。这对工厂是莫大的帮助，但进行的方法应讲究，先跟厂长经理职员讲通，再召集大会批评，不要使领导上下不了台。也可以利用职工代表大会、支部大会、青年团员大会等来进行。要一律建立工厂管理委员会。一波同志指出：一切问题都要拿到工厂管理委员会来研究。工厂管理委员会是工厂的最高权力机关，但这与厂长负责制并不矛盾，厂长仍有最后决定权，但厂长又不应老用这个最后决定权。这对生产是有好处的。其他，关于征收工人所得税的问题、政府建立劳动局的问题、工人的战勤负担问题，一波同志都有所说明。
