　　Developing Rural Sidelines to Increase Exports
  　Baoding Pig Bristle Industry Sees Great Development
    [Baoding Electric] The pig bristle industry in Baoding City has been developing rapidly recently, providing work for female workers in the city and suburban villages. The North China Yijuxing Main Store has established a branch in Baoding to purchase pig bristles. More than ninety cadres have been assigned to establish pig bristle purchasing stations in Tangshan, Quyang, Shimen, Xinji, Liushi, Mulou, Nangong, and Beiping. The pig bristles collected by each station are transported to Baoding for combing before being shipped out. From February to now, the Baoding market alone has collected more than 120,000 catties of pig bristles (referring to combed pig bristles, specifically called "Liu Zi"). Pig bristles amounted to more than 53,000 catties. Due to the expansion of business, the pig bristle collection and combing business has resumed in thirty villages in the southern suburbs. After they collect the pig bristles and comb them, every 100 catties of pig bristles can yield 33 catties of Liu Zi, and more than 60 catties of waste pig bristles can be used as fertilizer, each catty equivalent to one catty of bean cake. There are now at least 200 workers in the pig bristle combing factories in Baoding, and each person can earn more than three catties of millet per day. Pig bristles have always been one of the main export commodities. Before the Incident [likely referring to the War of Resistance Against Japan - translator's note], it was very developed in Baoding, and pig bristles from Jin-Sui, Xi'an, and Shandong were all transported to Baoding for combing and centralized export. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously assist the pig bristle industry at present to enable it to develop more smoothly.

　　开展农村副业增加出口
  　保定猪毛业大发展
    【保定电】保定市猪毛业，近来发展很快，使得本市及市郊乡村女工有了活做。华北义聚兴总店，在保定设了分店，收买猪毛。以九十多个干部分别在唐山、曲阳、石门、辛集、留史、木楼、南宫、北平设立了猪毛收购分庄。各庄所收猪毛，统运保定梳好后再运走。自二月到现在，仅保定市场上已收猪毛（系指梳好的猪毛，专名叫柳子）十二万余斤。猪鬃五万三千多斤。由于业务的开展，恢复了城南市郊三十来村收猪毛，梳猪毛的业务生产。他们收回猪毛后经过梳制，每百斤猪毛可提出三十三斤柳子，六十多斤废猪毛还可做肥料，每斤顶一斤豆饼。保定现在梳猪毛工厂，每日最低有二百多工人，每日每人可挣三斤多小米。猪毛一向是主要的出口品之一，事变前在保定很发达，晋绥、西安、山东一带猪毛都来保经过梳制集中出口。故在目前对猪毛业大力协助，使之更顺利的发展，是很必要的。
