    The British House of Commons has passed another "sensational" bill—to nationalize the steel industry. This is the third "measure of Labour's socialist policy" following the two major "benevolent policies" of "bank nationalization" and "coal mine nationalization." Bank, coal mine, and steel nationalization may seem like "socialist measures," but a closer look at the "nationalization" process reveals the fox tail hidden behind the "socialist" facade! During the "bank nationalization," the British people's taxes were used to buy the banks from the bank owners, and then the management rights of the banks were handed back to the original bank owners. It was "the same old medicine in a new bottle." The bank owners found the Labour government's approach "lovely" because their personal income increased compared to before. "Coal mine nationalization" followed the same pattern, and the coal mine owners were also delighted, thanking the Labour government for taking such good care of them. This time, 300 million pounds will be used to buy 107 steel companies, and the management rights will remain with "the current operators." We dare to say that the steel company bosses will welcome this "socialist measure" of the Labour Party just like the bank bosses and coal mine bosses!

    工党的狐狸尾巴！
    英国下院又通过了一则“耸人听闻”的议案——要把钢铁业收归“国有”了，这是继“银行国有”及“煤矿国有”两大“德政”之后的第三个“工党社会主义政策的措施”。银行、煤矿及钢铁都归“国有”似乎是“社会主义措施”，但如进一步看一下“国有”的过程，便不难看出那在“社会主义”外衣后面隐藏着的狐狸尾巴！“银行国有”时是用英国人民的捐税购自银行主，然后再把银行管理权交给原来的银行主，“换汤不换药”，银行主们很觉得工党政府这个办法“可爱”，因为个人的收入比以前增多了。“煤矿国有”时也是如法泡制，煤矿主也皆大欢喜，感谢工党政府照顾他们真周到。这一次又用三亿金镑收买一零七家钢铁公司，经营权也仍是“目前经营的人”，我们敢断定，钢铁公司的老板们会和银行老板、煤矿老板，一样的欢迎工党的这个“社会主义措施”的！
