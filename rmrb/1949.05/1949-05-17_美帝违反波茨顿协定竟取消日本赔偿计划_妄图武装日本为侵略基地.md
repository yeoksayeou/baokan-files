Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Reports from various sources: U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, issued a statement at the State Department on the 12th, unilaterally announcing that the U.S. government had decided to cancel the temporary Japanese reparations plan promulgated in April 1947. (According to this plan, 30% of Japanese factories designated for reparations by MacArthur should be extracted first and distributed to China, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the Philippines.) He also announced the cessation of dismantling all Japanese factories designated for reparations, including those belonging to basic war equipment, and the termination of any Japanese reparations. After the U.S. government announced this decision, stocks of Japanese munitions factories and heavy industries all soared. Japanese Prime Minister and war criminal Shigeru Yoshida also declared at a press conference that Japan's international status has gradually improved.

This arbitrary and reactionary decision by the U.S. government directly violates the Potsdam Proclamation regarding the issue of Japan's surrender, jointly issued by China, the United Kingdom, and the United States in July 1945 and agreed to by the Soviet Union. Articles Five and Six of the Proclamation stipulated that Japan would be allowed to maintain the industries necessary for its economy and capable of paying reparations in kind, but not the industries that could enable it to rearm for war. This arbitrary and reactionary decision by the U.S. government also directly violates the Moscow Conference agreement on the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission, issued by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States in December 1945 and agreed to by China. According to this agreement, "formulating the policies, principles, and standards to be observed by Japan in fully implementing the terms of surrender" falls within the power of the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, decisions involving the basic policy of the Potsdam Proclamation and the common interests of all countries that fought against Japan, such as canceling Japanese reparations, clearly fall within the scope of joint decisions by the Far Eastern Commission and not within the scope of unilateral actions by the U.S. government. This illegal action by the U.S. government is a further measure by U.S. imperialism to foster the revival of Japanese militarist aggressive forces. In order to make Japan its military base in the Far East, the U.S. government has consistently opposed the implementation of the principles stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement that Japan should compensate the Allied countries for their losses and should not retain military industries. Prior to this, the U.S. government and its commander in Japan, MacArthur, had repeatedly reduced the Japanese reparations plan, and had arbitrarily removed thousands of factories from the list of factories included in the reparations plan. This action by the U.S. government has aroused widespread opposition from world democratic public opinion, especially Chinese public opinion. World and Chinese public opinion have repeatedly warned that the U.S. government's imperialist policy will inevitably lead to the complete cancellation of the Japanese reparations plan. These warnings have been confirmed by the U.S. government's actions today.

McCoy disingenuously stated when announcing the cessation of Japanese reparations that this was to "stabilize the Japanese economy and lead it towards the goal of self-sufficient occupation." But it is well known that the munitions and aircraft factories that Japan should first dismantle for reparations have no impact on the recovery and development of Japan's peaceful economy. This decision by the U.S. government is clearly for other sinister purposes, namely, to rearm Japan, turn Japan into a U.S. arsenal and aggression base in the Far East, and further make the Japanese economy a vassal of U.S. monopoly capital.

### 美帝违反波茨顿协定竟取消日本赔偿计划  妄图武装日本为侵略基地

　　美帝违反波茨顿协定竟取消日本赔偿计划
    妄图武装日本为侵略基地
    【新华社北平十五日电】各方报道：美国出席远东委员会代表麦考埃十二日在国务院发表声明，片面地宣布美国政府已决定取消一九四七年四月颁布的日本临时赔偿计划（按照该计划规定在麦克阿瑟作赔偿的日本工厂中应先行提取百分之三十分配与中、英、荷、菲四国），停止拆卸一切充作赔偿的日本工厂，包括属于基本战争设备的工厂在内，并终止日本的任何赔偿。麦考埃同时已将美国政府上述决定通知远东委员会。美国这一决定公布后，日本各军火工厂及重工业的股票，都一致飞跃上涨。日本首相、战犯吉田茂也在记者招待会上宣称：日本之国际地位已渐次提高。
    美国政府这一专横的反动的决定，直接违背一九四五年七月中英美三国发表并经苏联同意的关于日本投降问题的波茨顿公告，该公告第五条第六款规定日本将被准许维持其经济所必需及可以偿付货物赔款之工业，但可以使其重新武装作战之工业不在其内。美国政府的这一专横的反动的决定，又直接违背一九四五年十二月苏英美三国发表并经中国同意的莫斯科会议关于设立远东委员会的协议、按照该协议、“制定日本于完全履行投降条件的应遵守之政策、原则及标准”属于远东委员会的权力，因此，涉及波茨顿公告基本政策并涉及对日作战各国共同利益的取消日本赔偿的决定，显然属于远东委员会共同决定的范围，而不属于美国政府片面行动的范围。美国政府这一非法行动是美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义侵略势力复活的进一步措施。美国政府为了使日本成为其在远东的军事基地一贯反对执行波茨顿协定规定的日本应赔偿盟国损失并不得保存军事工业的原则。在此以前，美国政府及其驻日统帅麦克阿瑟已将日本赔偿计划一减再减，多次从列入赔偿计划的工厂名单中擅自勾消了成千的工厂。美国政府的这种行动曾引起世界民主舆论特别是中国舆论的普遍的反对。世界和中国的舆论早已再三提出警告，指明美国政府的帝国主义政策，必然会造成日本赔偿计划的全部勾消，这些警告已经被美国政府今天的行动所证实了。
    麦考埃在宣布日本停止赔偿时诡辩说：这是为了“稳定日本经济，使其走向自给自足的占领目标”。但尽人皆知，日本应该首先拆卸充作赔偿的都是军火与飞机工厂，它对日本和平经济的恢复与发展，毫无影响。美国政府这一决定，显然是为了另外的阴险目的，即为了重新武装日本，把日本变成美国在远东的兵工厂和侵略基地，并使日本经济进一步成为美国垄断资本的附庸。
