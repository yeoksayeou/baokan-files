    Q&A on the Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region (Continued and completed)

    Part Five: About Investigation and Evaluation

    Q: Why is investigation and evaluation necessary?
    A: Because after the standard mu is fixed, the burden is calculated according to the agricultural tax registration form. If some information is true and some is not, the burden will be unbalanced and unreasonable. Therefore, investigation and evaluation are necessary.

    Q: How can investigation and evaluation be made accurate?
    A: Mainly rely on truthful self-reporting and reporting by county and district organizations. Avoid localism, proceed from the perspective of balancing the burden across the entire region, and overcome selfishness and localism such as sheltering and retaliation.

    Q: What organization conducts the work of investigation and evaluation?
    A: Village cadres and a number of impartial old farmers jointly organize an "Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation Committee" to conduct investigation and evaluation according to the provisions of the new tax regulations.

    Q: How is investigation and evaluation carried out?
    A: First, the village government appoints literate people in the village to help each farmer fill in the agricultural tax registration form with information such as population, land, normal annual yield, other land income and its conversion into standard mu, livestock, deductible tax exemption points and livestock consumption, and the remaining burden mu. Then, the Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation Committee is organized to review and evaluate the agricultural tax registration form household by household using democratic methods, and correct any misreporting or false reporting. If the number of mu of land and yield are unclear at the meeting, on-site surveys and measurements can be carried out in the fields to obtain accurate agricultural tax registration forms. After the evaluation is completed, the village government should list and publicize the evaluation results.

    Q: What if the masses think the investigation is inaccurate or the evaluation is unfair?
    A: If any farmer has different opinions on the items listed, they can state their reasons and apply to the village government to submit them to the Evaluation Committee for review and reconsideration. If the Evaluation Committee considers the reasons to be valid, it should revise the relevant items in the registration form based on the reasons. If it considers the reasons to be invalid, it can propose reasons and opinions for refutation. The results of the review and reconsideration should be formally notified to the applicant by the village government and announced in an appropriate place. If the applicant is still not satisfied with the results of the review and reconsideration, they can apply to the county government within five days of receiving the official notice from the village government, and the county government will send personnel to investigate and resolve the matter based on the actual situation.

    Q: What should the county and district governments do if they find inaccuracies in the assessment of yield in the villages under their jurisdiction?
    A: They can designate relevant districts and villages to organize a joint agricultural tax survey committee to re-survey and evaluate.

    Q: How is the standard mu fixed?
    A: When the county government believes that the investigation and evaluation work in the county has reached a true and balanced level, it should prepare two copies of the county agricultural tax registration roster and submit them to the administrative office (or provincial government) and the North China People's Government for verification. After being approved by the North China People's Government, the standard mu of the entire county is considered fixed. Except for land improvement or changes in soil quality due to natural conditions (such as damage from mountain floods, river diversions, siltation, and sand pressure), which may cause changes in soil quality and allow for revision of the standard mu, it will no longer be changed.

    Part Six: About Penalties (Omitted)

    Part Seven: About Supplementary Provisions

    Q: Who has the right to interpret the amended new tax regulations?
    A: The North China People's Government. Local governments at all levels can only conduct propaganda and explanation to the people based on the new tax regulations and relevant documents and instructions promulgated by the North China People's Government. If the masses have different opinions on the new tax regulations, they can promptly report them to the North China People's Government, but they cannot arbitrarily modify them based on their own opinions, or explain them to the masses casually based on their own opinions.

专栏：询问与答复

    华北区农业税暂行税则问答（续完）
    第五部分  关于调查评议
    问：为什么要调查评议？
    答：因为标准亩固定以后，负担就是按着农业税登记表来计算的，如果有的真实，有的不真实，负担就会不平衡、不合理，所以就要进行调查评议。
    问：怎样才能调查评议真实？
    答：主要依靠自报真实和县区组织报导，不本位，从全区负担平衡出发，克服自私自利和包庇、报复等本位主义。
    问：由什么机构来进行调查评议的工作？
    答：由村干部并聘请一部分公正老农，共同组织“农业税调查评议委员会”按新税则各条的规定，进行调查评议。
    问：怎样进行调查评议？
    答：首先由村政府指定村里识字的人，帮助各农户把人口、土地、常年应产量，其他土地收入及其折合之标准亩、牲畜和应扣除之免税点及牲畜消耗数，以及所余之负担亩数等，填入农业税登记表；然后组织农业税调查评议委员会，用民主办法，对农业税登记表逐户审查评议，改正其错报或假报之处；如对土地亩数和产量在会上闹不清时，可到地里作实地勘查评丈，以求得农业税登记表的真实，评议完后，村政府应将评议结果列榜公布。
    问：群众认为调查不实，评议不公怎样办？
    答：各农户对榜列各项有不同意见时，可提出理由，申请村政府交评委会复查复议，评委会认为有理由的，则应根据其理由改订登记表有关项目，如认为无理由的，可提出批驳的理由与意见；复查复议的结果，应由村政府正式通知申请人，并于适当处所公布；申请人对于复查复议的结果仍不满意时，可于接到村政府正式通知五日以内，向县政府申请，由县政府派员调查，根据实际情况予以解决。
    问：县、区政府发现所属村庄，在评订产量中有不真实的地方怎么办？
    答：可指定有关区、村组织农业税联合勘察委员会，重行勘察评议。
    问：怎样固定标准亩？
    答：县政府认为全县调查评议工作，已达真实平衡程度时，即应缮写县农业税登记清册二份，分呈行署（或省政府）及华北人民政府查核，经华北人民政府核准后，全县的标准亩就算固定，除土地改良或因自然条件起了变化（如山水冲坏、河流改道、淤刮沙压等），而引起土质改变时，可改订标准亩外，就不再变动了。
    第六部分  关于罚则（略）
    第七部分  关于附则
    问：新税则修正，解释权属于谁？
    答：属华北人民政府。各级地方政府，只能根据华北人民政府所公布的新税则和有关文件及指示，向人民进行宣传解释，群众对新税则有不同意见时，可及时向华北人民政府反映，但不能根据自己的意见擅自修改，或根据自己的意见向群众随便解释。
