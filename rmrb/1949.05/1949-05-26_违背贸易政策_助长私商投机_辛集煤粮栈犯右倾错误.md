　　Violating Trade Policy
    Encouraging Private Merchant Speculation
  　Xinji Coal and Grain Station Commits Right-Leaning Errors
    [Jizhong Dispatch] The Xinji Coal and Grain Station, under the Supply Bureau of the North China Government's Ministry of Finance, violated trade policies in late March. Without going through state-owned trading departments, it auctioned off grain at low prices through privately-owned grain stores and allowed them to defer payments, giving private merchants opportunities for speculation and profiteering, causing significant financial losses to the state and affecting price fluctuations. On March 22nd, after the Xinji Coal and Grain Station of the North China Supply Bureau received the task of transporting military grain to the Taiyuan front, it decided to convert the Xinji grain reserves into cash and purchase grain elsewhere on the western front, where grain prices were lower, in order to save manpower and animal power and shorten transportation time. Therefore, the North China Supply Bureau sent staff member Luo Binghua to assist manager Ma Mantang of the Xinji Coal and Grain Station in this work. The grain sales work began without contacting the state-owned Yuhua General Store, and instead, it directly sought transactions with privately-owned stores such as Xieli Xing, Yude, Qingyu, Yusheng, and the Xinji City local grain depot Yongfeng. At that time, because the front urgently needed grain, the transaction was made at a price of 5 to 6 yuan lower than the market price per "shi" (斗) of grain, selling a total of 140,000 "jin" (斤) of black beans, 30,000 "jin" of millet, and 10,000 "jin" of red sorghum, totaling 180,000 "jin". Calculated at market prices, this was a loss of 195,000 yuan. The negotiated price for this batch of grain was 1.95 million yuan, but only 170,000 yuan was paid on the same day (March 23rd). Some of the remaining payments were not made until April 4th, allowing these private merchants to take the opportunity to engage in speculation and profiteering. The privately-owned Qingyu Grain Store bought 7,200 "jin" of red sorghum and 55,080 "jin" of black beans from the Coal and Grain Station, worth 637,600 yuan. Lacking funds, it secretly auctioned off 3,000 "jin" of black beans stored at the Yuhua General Store and 2,400 "jin" of grain stored by customers for 600,000 yuan to pay the Coal and Grain Station. Then it sold 30,000 "jin" of the purchased grain to an oil shop locally; without spending any capital, it earned 27,675 yuan. The privately-owned Yude Grain Store sold 22,700 yuan worth of grain on the same day after buying grain from the Coal and Grain Station, paying only 10,000 yuan to the Coal and Grain Station, and using the remaining funds to抢购 grain in the market. At the same time, these five grain stores evaded taxes of 19,005 yuan under the guise of secret "free" transactions. In addition, Shi Yongxiang of Sanjie in Xinji also acquired 25,000 "jin" of grain from the Coal and Grain Station through the Yusheng Grain Store and evaded taxes of 2,000 yuan by using the method of Xinji transactions and selling in the old city. The speculative activities of private merchants caused fluctuations in grain prices in Xinji City. From March 24th to 29th, in five days, millet rose from 12.5 yuan per "jin" to 16.56 yuan, and black beans and red sorghum also rose by more than 2 yuan. At the same time, because the purchase and sale were not done through state-owned stores, the state treasury suffered a great loss. If this batch of grain had been sold at market prices, it would have been worth 2.1 million yuan, but selling to private merchants resulted in a loss of 195,000 yuan. In addition, due to the delay in payment for the goods, calculated based on rising prices, the difference over the five days until the 29th amounted to 13,680 yuan. After research by the Xinji City Industry and Commerce Bureau and with the approval of the Commissioner's Office, the following handling measures were decided: 1. Ma Mantang, manager of the Xinji Coal and Grain Station of the North China Supply Bureau, and Luo Binghua violated trade policies, acted on their own without going through state-owned trading departments, and unconditionally auctioned grain at low prices through private merchants, encouraging the speculative and destructive behavior of private merchants and causing price fluctuations. In addition to conducting a profound self-criticism, it is recommended that their superiors give them appropriate punishment. 2. The five grain stores illegally evaded taxes. In addition to paying the full amount of taxes owed, they should be criticized and educated in the industry association. 3. Qingyu Grain Store, which arbitrarily used public grain (Yuhua's storage) as speculative capital to carry out illegal activities, and Shi Yongxiang, who evaded taxes, should be severely punished.

### 违背贸易政策  助长私商投机　辛集煤粮栈犯右倾错误

　　违背贸易政策
    助长私商投机
  　辛集煤粮栈犯右倾错误
    【冀中电】华北政府财政部供应局所属的辛集煤粮栈，曾于三月下旬违背贸易政策，未经国营贸易部门，即通过私营粮店低价拍卖粮食，并允其延期付款，给予私商以投机倒把机会；而使国家财政吃了大亏，影响物价波动。三月二十二日，华北供应局辛集煤粮栈接到向太原前线调运军粮的任务后，为了节省人畜力，缩短调运时间，同时西线粮价较低，便决定把辛集存粮变款，到西线另行购买，因此华北供应局即派职员骆丙华到辛集煤粮栈协助经理马满堂进行这一工作。售粮工作开始和国营裕华总店没有联系，便直接找私营商店协力兴、裕德、庆裕、裕生与辛集市地方粮库永丰进行交易。当时因前方急于用粮，便以每市斗粮低于市场五元至六元的价格成交，共出售了黑豆十四万斤，小米三万斤，红粮一万斤，总计十八万斤。按市价折合共少卖十九万五千元。这批粮食出售议价共合一百九十五万元，当日（二十三日）只付款十七万元，余款有的直到四月四日才付；这些私商遂乘机投机捣鬼。私营庆裕粮店买了煤粮栈红粮七千二百斤，黑豆五万五千零八十斤，价值六十三万七千六百元，购货无款，便把裕华总店所存的黑豆三千斤，和客人存粮二千四百斤，偷着拍卖了六十万元交付煤粮栈，接着就在当地把买进的粮食，卖给了油店三万斤；一个本钱没用就赚了两万七千六百七十五元。私营裕德粮店买了煤粮栈的粮食后，当天就折卖了二万二千七百元的粮食，只付煤粮栈一万元，拿着余款又在市场上抢购粮食。同时，该五户粮店并在秘密“自由”交易掩护下，偷税一万九千零五元。另外辛集三街史永祥通过裕生粮店也收购了煤粮栈粮食两万五千斤，而以辛集成交，旧城出售的方式，偷税两千元。私商的投机活动，致使辛集市的粮价受到波动。三月二十四日起到二十九日五天内小米由每市斤十二元五角上升为十六元五角六分，黑豆、红粮也上升了两元多。同时由于没有通过国营商店收售，使国家财政蒙受很大损失。这批粮食如按市价出售，可值二百一十万元，与私商成交即少卖十九万五千元。加上批货没有交款，按物价上升折合，拖至二十九日五天时间就相差一万三千六百八十元。此问题经辛集市工商局研究，申请专署批准，决定处理办法为：一、华北供应局辛集煤粮栈经理马满堂和骆丙华违背贸易政策，不通过国营贸易部门而自作主张，无原则的通过私商低价拍卖粮食，助长了私商的投机破坏行为，引起物价波动的错误，除应进行深刻检讨外，并建议所属上级，分别给以适当处分。二、五户粮店，违法偷税，除按数补税外，并在行业会进行批评教育。三、庆裕粮店擅目动用公粮（裕华存）作投机资本，进行非法活动，与史永祥的逃税，应给予严格处罚。
