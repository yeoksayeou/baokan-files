　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 29th: TASS Moscow reports: Local newspapers published the memorandum exchanged between the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the British Embassy in the Soviet Union. On April 28th, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson, visited the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and handed over a memorandum. The memorandum fabricated accusations that the Soviet authorities allowed incorrect actions to be taken against employees of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union and forced several Soviet citizens working in the British Embassy to stop their work. The memorandum also stated that Soviet authorities unreasonably refused to issue entry visas to British nationals sent to the British Embassy in Moscow to perform diplomatic work. On May 20th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev met with the British Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Harrison, and presented the Soviet Foreign Ministry's reply, which stated: The allegations in your embassy's memorandum regarding the so-called persecution of British Embassy staff by Soviet authorities are unfounded. However, since this concerns the issue of Soviet citizens employed by the British Embassy, all the accusations in the memorandum are nothing more than an inadmissible attempt by your embassy to interfere in the relations between Soviet authorities and Soviet citizens. Your embassy has no right to interfere in the issue of relations between Soviet authorities and Soviet citizens (regardless of where Soviet citizens work). The Soviet reply stated, when addressing the issue of refusing to issue entry visas: International law stipulates that "visas may be refused to persons who cannot be received." The reply also cited many instances where the British government refused to issue visas to Soviet citizens sent to the Soviet Embassy in London. The reply concluded by pointing out: The Soviet Foreign Ministry cannot ignore the intolerable tone of your ambassador and the memorandum, as well as the threats of retaliation against staff of the Soviet Embassy in the United Kingdom contained therein. The British government should understand that this method cannot succeed in dealing with the Soviet government.

　　苏联外交部公布备忘录
    驳斥英大使馆无理照会
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：此间报纸刊载苏联外交部及英国驻苏大使馆间所交换的备忘录。四月二十八日，英驻苏大使彼得逊访苏联外长维辛斯基并递交备忘录一件。该备忘录凭空捏造苏联当局容许对英驻苏大使馆雇员采取不正确的行动，并迫使若干在英大使馆工作的苏联公民停止其工作。备忘录并称：苏联机关毫无理由地拒绝发入境签证给派往莫斯科英大使馆担任外交工作的英国国民。五月二十日，苏联外交部副部长古赛夫接见英驻苏代办哈里逊，并提出苏联外交部的复文，略称：贵大使馆的备忘录关于苏联机关对英国大使馆职员进行所谓迫害的断言，是毫无根据的。但是，这既然涉及英大使馆雇用的苏联公民的问题，则备忘录中的一切责难不是别的，只能是贵大使馆干涉苏联机关与苏联公民之间关系的不可容许的企图。苏联机关与苏联公民（不论苏联公民在什么地方工作）之间的关系问题，贵大使馆无权过问。苏联复文在谈到拒发入境签证的问题时称：国际法规定，对于“不能予以接待的人员可以拒发签证”。复文并举出英国政府拒发签证给派往伦敦苏大使馆工作的苏联公民的许多事实。复文最后指出：苏联外交部不能忽视贵大使与备忘录中的不可容忍的论调及其中对苏联驻英大使馆职员进行报复的威胁。英国政府应该明白：在与苏联政府处理事务中，这种方法是不能获得成功的。
