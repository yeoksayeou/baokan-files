    Strive to Restore and Develop Industrial Production
    North China Workers' Congress Opens
    Comrade Huang Jing Calls on Workers to Unite and Increase Production
    [Tianjin Electric Dispatch] “Strive to Restore and Develop Industrial Production” – this is the central task of the North China Workers' Representative Conference held yesterday (2nd) in Tianjin, as celebrated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The venue was filled with silk banners of congratulations from all directions. The golden tassels hung densely, shining brightly, expressing the infinite hopes and concerns of the people of the whole country for the working class. The 484 delegates present, all outstanding figures from large and small industrial and mining enterprises in North China, gathered together today, beautifully depicting a microcosm of the great unity of workers in North China. The delegates present felt infinite joy for the glory that the workers of North China have achieved today. From beginning to end, the venue expressed warm gratitude for the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the brave and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the united struggle of the entire people. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Zhao Guoqiang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech, stating: "The task of the meeting is to implement the policy of restoring and developing industrial production in North China, in order to support the rapid victory of the national liberation war and build a new China." Comrade Huang Jing, Deputy Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke first. After describing the backwardness of Chinese industry and the reasons for the various sufferings of the working class, he said: "We must strive to restore and develop industrial production, so that the proportion of industrial production in the national economy increases from the current 10 percent to 20 percent, 30 percent, or even more. Only in this way can we achieve thorough economic liberation." Based on the experience of Tianjin, he believes that it is extremely important to clearly establish new and united labor-management relations, and that the establishment of factory management committees by absorbing worker representatives is a fundamental difference from the management of factories by bureaucratic capital. When talking about the issue of private enterprises, he said: "In order to restore and develop production, we should eliminate concerns and correctly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital." Comrade Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also came to speak. He praised the spirit of the workers of North China in the heroic struggles of the "February 7th" strike and the Kailuan Five Mines strike in history. Then, he repeatedly explained the importance of restoring and developing industrial production. He said: "The Chinese people have only taken the first step in acquiring political power, and the road ahead is still very long. The purpose of the revolution is for construction, and only through construction can we talk about improving the lives of the people across the country." He urged everyone: "We are not proud because of the national victory, because our cause is just beginning." Regarding the issue of developing industry, he emphasized: "This is the central link of future work." The speeches of two veteran workers who had participated in and led the "February 7th" strike aroused the solemn respect of the delegates present. Comrade Ling Biying, a member of the North China People's Government and Director of the Trade Union of the First Printing Bureau of the People's Bank, said from his 40 years of personal experience: "Only by following Chairman Mao can the working class have a future." Yang Baosong, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, happily described the heroic strike struggle of the workers in Changxindian during the "February 7th" strike. He rubbed his hands excitedly and said: "We can also hold such a big meeting today. We have never heard of this in the past!" Ma Shuzhen, a female worker from Yizhong Tobacco Leaf Company, spoke on the stage. After bowing to the huge statues of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, she recounted her past painful life to the workers and brothers, with tears in her eyes. She said: "Today our workers have turned over. In the future, as long as we work hard to produce and support the front, our lives can be improved." Wang Zongshu, Director of Tianjin Electrical Equipment Factory, expressed in his speech that he fully realized the importance of worker unity. Zhen Rongdian, a special-class labor hero who attended the World Youth Workers' Conference, called it a family meeting of workers. He said enthusiastically: "In the past, we held meetings on the top of Taihang Mountain. Today we have come to our own liberated city. In the past, we said that we would go to Pingjin to hold a meeting in the future. Today we have finally come to Tianjin." His speech was drowned out by applause. At this point, the conference adjourned. The delegates decided to follow the direction prompted by the congratulatory message from the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, "To learn to manage the city and build the city with great efforts, to closely link workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, to consolidate the people's regime, and to build a great new China with our labor and the vanguard role of the proletariat," in order to complete the historical task of the conference.

    【天津电】“为恢复和发展工业生产而奋斗”——这是中国共产党中央委员会庆祝昨日（二日）在天津举行的华北职工代表会议的中心任务。会场满挂来自各方的绫缎贺幛。金穗密垂，灿烂夺目，表现了全国人民对于工人阶级无限的热望与关切，到会代表四百八十四人，均华北各地大小工矿之优秀人物，今日欢聚一堂，美好的描绘了一幅华北职工大团结的缩影，到会代表对于华北工人今天获得的光荣，觉得无限喜悦，会场自始至终，对于中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导，人民解放军的勇敢善战，和全体人民的团结奋斗，表示热烈的感谢。会议开始，华北总工会筹委会副主任赵国强同志致开幕词，略称：“会议任务为贯彻执行恢复与发展华北工业生产的方针，以支援全国解放战争迅速胜利，建设新中国”。中共天津市委副书记黄敬同志，首先讲话，他述说了中国工业的落后情况，及工人阶级所受之种种痛苦的原因以后，他说：“我们必须努力恢复发展工业生产，使工业生产在全国经济的比重上，由现在百分之十的情况，增加到百分之二十、三十，甚至更多。唯有如此、我们才能在经济上得到彻底解放，根据天津工作经验，他认为明确建立新的团结的职工关系，极为重要，吸收职工代表建立工厂管理委员会，则是与官僚资本经营管理工厂的根本区别。谈到私营企业问题时，他说：“为了恢复与发展生产，应该消除顾虑，正确实行劳资两利的方针。”中华全国总工会副主席李立三同志也亲临讲话，他盛赞华北工人在历史上“二七”、开滦五矿大罢工等英勇斗争的精神。接着，反复说明恢复与发展工业生产的重要。他说：“中国人民取得了政权只是走完了第一步，今后的道路还很长远。革命的目的是为了建设，只有建设才能谈到全国人民生活的改善。”他叮嘱大家说：“我们并不因为全国胜利而骄傲，因为我们的事业还刚是开始。”关于发展工业问题，他强调说：“这是今后工作的中心环节。”两位曾经参加和领导“二七”大罢工的老工人讲话，使到会代表肃然起敬。现任华北人民政府委员人民银行第一印刷局职工总会主任凌必应同志在四十多年的切身经验中，他说：“只有跟着毛主席走，除此以外工人阶级没有别的前途。”北平市总工会筹委会副主任杨宝嵩他高兴的述说“二七”长辛店工人英勇的罢工斗争，他搓着双手激动地说：“我们今天也能开这样大的会了，过去听也没有听说过呀！”颐中烟叶公司的女工马淑贞上台讲话，他对毛主席朱总司令的巨像鞠躬后，并对着全场职工兄弟回述起过去痛苦生活，感动得满眼泪水，她说：“今天我们工人翻过身来了，今后只要努力生产支援前线，我们的生活就可以改善。”天津电工器材厂厂长王宗术在讲话中表示他充分体味到职工团结的重要。曾出席世界青工大会的特等劳动英雄甄荣典，称作是工人的家庭会议，他热烈的说：“过去我们在太行山顶上开会，今天到我们自己解放的城市来了，过去我们说将来我们要到平津去开会，今天我们终于来到了天津。”他的讲话被掌声所淹没。大会至此，遂告休会。代表们决遵循中共中央华北局贺词上所提示的方向，“用极大的努力去学会管理城市和建设城市，使工人和农民，使工业和农业紧密的联系起来，巩固人民的政权，用我们的劳动和无产阶级的先锋作用建设伟大的新中国”，以完成大会的历史任务。
