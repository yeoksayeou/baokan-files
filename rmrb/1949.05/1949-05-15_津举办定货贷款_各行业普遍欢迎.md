    Tianjin Launches Order-Based Loans
    Broadly Welcomed by Various Industries

    [Tianjin Electric Dispatch] Since the Tianjin Communications Bank launched order-based loans last month, it has been widely welcomed by various industries in the city. Recently, industries such as textiles, vegetable oil, flour, tanning, rubber, iron, papermaking, chemicals, and matches have gone to the bank to request order-based loans. The purpose of the bank's order-based loans is to develop industrial production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the loan targets are currently limited to machine industries that lack working capital or need to expand production, and that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and are relatively large in scale. The loans will gradually be promoted later. Based on the experience of the past month, the bank first conducts investigations into various industries and typical factories before issuing order-based loans, to understand the production situation of each industry and the problems existing in production, as a basis for determining loan targets. At the time of contracting, the borrower calculates the amount of interest converted into physical goods, fills in a bill of lading for the principal and interest, and submits it to the bank for safekeeping. The bank collects the principal and interest together when due. The interest rate is a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 1.5%, generally 1.2%, all calculated based on physical goods.

    津举办定货贷款
    各行业普遍欢迎
    【天津电】津市交通银行举办的定货贷款，自上月开始以来，已得到全市各行业的普遍欢迎。最近已有纺织、植物油、面粉、制革、橡胶、铁业、造纸、化学、火柴等业粉赴该行要求定货贷款。该行举办的定货贷款，目的在于发展有利于国计民生的工业生产。因此贷款对象目前暂限于缺乏资金周转或需扩大生产的有利于国计民生而规模又较大的机器工业，以后再逐步推广。根据一个月来的经验，该行在发放定货贷款前，先进行各行业与典型工厂的调查，了解各业生产情况和生产中存在的问题，作为确定贷款对象时的依据。在定约时即由借款人算好利息折合实物数额，填具本息定货提单交银行收执，到期时银行一并收取本息。利息最低一分，最高一分五厘，一般是一分二厘，均按实物计算。
