    "Mass Labor Deployment" Causes Work Delays!
    The masses in Shijiazhuang Village, Xincheng, are very dissatisfied with the forced mass labor deployment. Over 400 men and women laborers were only able to plant a little more than 20 mu of cotton in a day due to the mass labor deployment. When gathering, the village representative, Cui Gang, and others shouted themselves hoarse and almost broke the gong. By the time the sun was above the trees, people finally went to the fields, crowded together, unable to accomplish much work, and then it was time to go home for dinner. Comrade Fan Menglin, the district head, came to the village, and the masses chaotically said to District Head Fan, "You must help us find a way out!" Representative Cui Gang also said, "We want to do things well, but we can't direct well!" The district head discussed with everyone how to avoid losses and do more work. Later, he introduced the mutual aid organization of other villages. The masses in groups of three and two said, "Planting cotton is different from other work. It has to be done with more people together. If there are too few people, you'll be exhausted and still won't be able to plant." Representative Cui Gang also admitted his mistake to everyone, saying, "You really don't grow in wisdom until you experience something!" Later, people found each other and formed groups, with a minimum of four households and a maximum of twelve, forming a total of twelve groups. The next day, the mass labor deployment was stopped, and each group worked on its own. Farmer Liu Chengjiang said, "It should have been done this way from the start, we would have planted much more!" Tian Yu's group, with old men and women, a total of ten people, planted two and a half mu of cotton in half a day. On the 13th, each group planted a total of 52 mu, surpassing the amount planted in the past two days. (Li Ke)

    “大拨工”误了工！
    新城石家庄村的群众，对强迫的大拨工，表示非常不满。四百多男女劳动力，由于大拨工一天才点种二十多亩棉花。集合时农会代表崔刚等，把嗓子喊哑了，锣快敲破了，太阳上了树梢，人们才下了地，拥挤着作不了多少活，又该回家吃饭了。区长范孟林同志来到这村，群众乱和范区长说：“你可给我们开道开道吧！”代表崔刚也说：“想把事办好，可是我们指挥不好！”区长和大家商量，咱们怎么能都不吃亏又作的活多，就怎么办，后来又介绍了别村组织互助的情形，群众们三一群两一伙的都说：“种棉可不同别的活，非人多点合着种不行，人少了累死也没有法种”。代表崔刚也向大伙认了错说：“真是不经一事，不长一智！”后来人们你找我我找他的结好了组，最少四家，最多十二家，共结了十二个组。第二天停止大拨工，各组作各组的。农民刘成江说：“先要这么着，早种多了！”田玉那组，连老头带妇女共十来个人，多半天就种上二亩半棉花。十三号那天各小组共种了五十二亩，顶过去两天种的。      （李克）
