Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 3rd:

The May Fourth Movement, which took place in Beijing (then known as Peiping) on May 4, 1919, marks its 30th anniversary. It is the festival of the beginning of China's New Democratic Revolution, the festival of China's revolutionary youth movement, and the festival of China's New Culture Movement.

The May Fourth Movement occurred after the First World War from 1914 to 1918. The First World War had two impacts on the Chinese people: on the one hand, the capitalist system unprecedentedly exposed its ugliness due to the world imperialist war and began its collapse, causing the Chinese people to begin to politically detach themselves from the influence of the imperialist world; on the other hand, the Russian October Socialist Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent revolutionary movements in countries such as Germany, Austria, and Italy gave the Chinese people great new hope. This historical background divided the era of the entire world history and also divided the two periods of China's national democratic revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "Before this, China's bourgeois democratic revolution belonged to the category of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution, and was a part of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution. After this, China's bourgeois democratic revolution has changed to belong to the category of the new bourgeois democratic revolution, and in terms of the revolutionary front, it belongs to a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution." The May Fourth Movement of 1919 was a key to this historical change.

The May Fourth Movement occurred as follows: During the First World War, Japanese imperialism joined the imperialist group of Britain, France, Russia, and the United States, declared war on German imperialism, and took the opportunity to seize the privileges it had plundered in China. In less than three months after declaring war on Germany in August 1914, Japanese imperialism controlled the entire Shandong Province. But it was not satisfied with this. On January 18, 1915, it presented Yuan Shikai with the Twenty-One Demands aimed at destroying China. Yuan Shikai, who at the time wanted to rely on Japanese imperialism to become the emperor of China, frantically sent Cao Rulin, the Minister of Transportation of the Beijing government and one of the leaders of the pro-Japanese faction, to sign this treaty of national subjugation on May 9. After Germany's defeat, in January 1919, the victorious imperialist governments of the United States, Britain, and France held a "peace conference" in Paris to divide the spoils. The Beijing government, which had joined the war a year before the end of the war, also sent representatives to the conference. Under the pressure of the Chinese people, the representatives of the Beijing government put forward demands at the conference to recover the rights invaded by Japanese imperialism and abolish the Twenty-One Demands. However, due to the collusion between the U.S., British, and French imperialism and Japanese imperialism, as well as the Beijing government's policy of fawning on foreigners and betraying the country, the "peace conference" rejected China's demands, assigned Germany's privileges in Shandong to Japan, and completely refused to abolish the Twenty-One Demands, citing that it was not within the scope of the conference's discussion.

When the news of the Paris Peace Conference reached China, the people of the whole country were extremely indignant, and the young students in Beijing first ignited the flames of the anti-aggression and anti-treason movement. On May 4, 1919, thousands of students gathered at Tiananmen Square to hold a huge demonstration against the Beijing government, shouting slogans such as "Recover Shandong!" "Abolish the Twenty-One Demands!" "Punish the traitors!" However, the Beijing government not only rejected the just demands of the patriotic young students but also sent a large number of police and soldiers to suppress them. This further angered the demonstrating masses. The students then rushed to Zhao Jia Lou in Dongcheng, burned Cao Rulin's residence, and beat up famous traitors such as Lu Zongyu, the director of the Beijing government's currency system bureau, and Zhang Zongxiang, the ambassador to Japan. Under the high pressure of the Beijing government's mass arrest of students, the students further launched a strike and launched a large-scale street propaganda campaign on June 3, and the movement developed vigorously.

The heroic struggle of the young students in Beijing against imperialism and the Beiyang warlords immediately received enthusiastic responses from students all over the country, and workers and citizens also joined the wave. Shanghai workers went on strike, students went on strike, and merchants closed their shops. Railway workers in Tangshan Changxindian held demonstrations. Students, workers, and citizens in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Baoding, Jinan, Wuhan, Changsha, Xiamen, and the three northeastern provinces also launched heroic struggles, creating a nationwide mass movement. Under the strong pressure of the broad masses of the people, the Beijing government was finally forced to compromise, release the arrested students, dismiss Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, and Zhang Zongxiang from their positions as traitors, and refuse to sign the Treaty of Versailles.

The May Fourth Movement was an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement. This movement carried a revolutionary nature that the Xinhai Revolution did not have, that is, it thoroughly, uncompromisingly, and popularly opposed imperialism and feudal forces. The reason why the May Fourth Movement had this nature was that China's capitalism had further developed at that time, and the strength of the proletariat and the national bourgeoisie had grown. Due to the international situation at that time, Chinese revolutionary intellectuals were "under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin." At that time, a group of revolutionary intellectuals with communist ideas had emerged in China. In the May Fourth Movement, they formed a united front with the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals and took the lead in this movement. This combination of Marxist-Leninist thought and the practice of the Chinese revolution, although only a beginning at that time, gave the May Fourth Movement an unprecedented new look. At its beginning, the May Fourth Movement was limited to the scope of intellectuals, without the participation of workers and peasants. When it developed to the June 3rd Movement, with the participation of the broad proletariat, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie, it became a nationwide revolutionary movement.

The great significance of the May Fourth Movement is that the Chinese revolution has since embarked on the road of New Democracy, which is connected with the surging proletarian revolution in the world and has become a part of the world proletarian revolution. The May Fourth Movement rapidly revolutionized the Chinese people, preparing ideologically and with cadres for the founding of the Communist Party of China and the Northern Expedition. The Chinese New Democratic Revolution, which began with the May Fourth Movement, is now achieving victory on a national scale.

The historical position of the May Fourth Movement in the Chinese youth movement makes May Fourth designated as Chinese Youth Day. After the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth inherited the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement and consistently stood at the forefront of the revolution. Before the founding of the Communist Party of China, in 1920, Chinese revolutionary youth established the Chinese Socialist Youth League. In the Northern Expedition and the Land Revolution War, Chinese youth actively participated in the revolutionary struggle. The "December 9th" Youth Movement of 1935 kicked off the prelude to the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War, youth played an important role whether on the front lines or in the rear, in the liberated areas or in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. With the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese youth movement has entered an unprecedented national upsurge. Chinese youth will undoubtedly make greater contributions to the construction of the new China.

The May Fourth Movement was also an unprecedented cultural revolution movement in China. Before the May Fourth Movement, a group of Chinese intellectuals centered on the "New Youth" magazine launched an attack on the old morality, old literature, and feudal superstitious ideas, advocating new morality, advocating democracy, advocating science, and advocating vernacular literature and common people's literature. The left wing of the movement, represented by Li Dazhao, also began to publicize and advocate Marxism-Leninism, spreading communist ideas to China and leading the struggle on the cultural front to a new era. Before the "May Fourth," all the disputes between schools and imperial examinations, between new learning and old learning, and between Western learning and Chinese learning were only disputes between the bourgeoisie's new culture and feudalism's old culture. After the "May Fourth," the struggle on the cultural front became the struggle between the new culture of people's democracy led by historical materialism and dialectical materialism and the feudalist culture and imperialist culture of idealism and formalism. In this struggle, the bourgeois intellectuals of the original right wing of the movement, represented by Hu Shi, later threw themselves into the counter-revolutionary cultural camp, or withdrew from the battle and disappeared. However, the revolutionary camp, increasingly armed with the revolutionary theories of Marxism-Leninism and the practical experience of the Chinese revolution, rapidly grew and achieved great victories in the fields of social sciences and literature and art with an invincible momentum.

However, like the political aspect, the weakness of the May Fourth cultural revolution movement was that it failed to spread to the broad masses of workers and peasants, so the foundation of the revolutionary culture of the May Fourth and after the May Fourth was still weak. Under the rule of counter-revolution, although Chinese revolutionary culture achieved great results, it was not enough to completely defeat and replace imperialist culture and feudal culture. Only in the Chinese People's Liberated Areas can the task of establishing a completely new New Democratic culture be realized. In the liberated areas, whether during the Land Revolution War or the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, the cultural movement made major efforts in combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Especially after Comrade Mao Zedong published "On New Democracy" and after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art and the rectification movement, the erroneous deviations were corrected, and a clear direction was established, which further enabled the new culture of the liberated areas to achieve vigorous development in recent years. Now, in the situation of the victorious Chinese revolution, this people's democratic culture is excluding all imperialist culture and feudal culture and occupying the entire position in the cultural field.

    五四运动介绍
    发生于一九一九年五月四日北京（即北平）地方的五四运动，到现在已三十周年了。它是中国新民主主义革命运动开端的节日，是中国革命青年运动的节日，也是中国新文化运动的节日。
    五四运动发生在一九一四年至一九一八年的第一次世界大战以后。第一次世界大战给与中国人民两方面的影响：一方面，资本主义制度因为世界帝国主义战争空前地暴露了它的丑恶，并且开始了它的崩溃，使中国人民开始在政治上脱离帝国主义世界的影响；另一方面，一九一七年的俄国十月社会主义革命和随之而来的德奥意等国的革命运动，给中国人民以伟大的新的希望。这个历史背景，划分了整个世界历史的时代，也划分了中国民族民主革命的两个时期。如毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中所说：“在这以前，中国资产阶级民主主义革命，是属于旧的世界资产阶级民主主义革命的范畴之内的，是属于旧的世界资产阶级民主主义革命的一部分。在这以后，中国资产阶级民主主义革命，却改变为属于新的资产阶级民主主义革命的范畴，而在革命的阵线上说来，则属于世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分了。”一九一九年的五四运动，则是这个历史变化的一个关键。
    五四运动是这样发生的：第一次世界大战中，日本帝国主义加入了英、法、俄、美帝国主义集团，对德国帝国主义宣战，乘机夺取它在中国掠得的特权。在一九一四年八月对德国宣战后不到三个月，日本帝国主义就控制了整个山东省。但它并不以此为满足，在一九一五年一月十八日，又向袁世凯提出了灭亡中国的二十一条条约。当时想投靠日本帝国主义当中国皇帝的袁世凯，丧心病狂地派了北京政府的交通总长、亲日派首领之一曹汝霖于五月九日在这个亡国条约上签了字。德国失败后，一九一九年一月，战胜的美、英、法等帝国主义政府在巴黎召开分脏的“和平大会”，在大战结束前一年参加战争的北京政府也派了代表参加会议。在中国人民的压力之下，北京政府代表在会议上提出收回日本帝国主义侵略的权利和废除二十一条条约的要求。但是由于美、英、法帝国主义与日本帝国主义互相勾结，以及北京政府的媚外卖国政策，“和会”拒绝了中国的要求，将德国在山东的特权划归了日本，对废除二十一条条约，则借口不在会议讨论范围之内，也完全予以拒绝。
    巴黎和会的消息传至中国后，全国人民激愤异常，北京青年学生首先燃起了反侵略、反卖国运动的火焰。一九一九年五月四日，数千学生聚集天安门向北京政府举行了巨大的示威，高呼“收回山东！”“废除二十一条！”“惩办卖国贼！”等口号。但北京政府不仅拒绝了爱国青年学生的正义要求，并派大批军警出动镇压。这更激怒了示威的群众。学生们便涌向东城赵家楼，焚烧曹汝霖的住宅，并痛打北京政府币制局长陆宗汝和驻日公使章宗祥等著名卖国贼。在北京政府大批逮捕学生的高压下，学生又更进一步地发动了罢课，并于六月三日展开了大规模的街头宣传，运动蓬勃地发展起来。
    北京青年学生反对帝国主义、反对北洋军阀的英勇斗争立即得到了全国学生热烈响应，工人和市民也相继卷入了这个浪潮。上海工人罢工，学生罢课，商人罢市，唐山长辛店铁路工人举行游行示威。南京、杭州、天津、保定、济南、武汉、长沙、厦门以及东三省等地的学生工人和市民都展开了英勇的斗争，在全国造成了如火如荼的群众运动。在广大人民的强大压力下，北京政府终于被迫让步，释放了被捕的学生、撤销了曹汝霖、陆宗汝、章宗祥三个卖国贼的职务、并拒绝在巴黎和会上签字。
    五四运动是反帝反封建的运动。这一运动带着为辛亥革命所不曾有的革命性，这就是彻底地不妥协地和群众性地反对帝国主义和封建势力。五四运动所以具有这种性质，是因为当时中国的资本主义已得到了进一步的发展，无产阶级和民族资产阶级的力量已有了成长，而由于当时的国际形势，中国革命知识分子则“是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下”。当时中国已经产生了一批具有共产主义思想的革命知识分子，他们在五运四动中，与革命的小资产阶级和资产阶级的知识分子结成统一战线，担任了这个运动的领导。这种马克思列宁主义的思想与中国革命的实践的结合，当时虽然还仅仅是开始，却就使五四运动具有了前所未有的新面目。五四运动在其开始时，还局限于知识分子的范围内，没有工人、农民参加。发展到了六三运动时，有了广大的无产阶级、小资产阶级、资产阶级参加，才成了全国范围的革命运动。
    五四运动的伟大意义是使中国革命从此走上了新民主主义的道路，它与全世界风起云涌的无产阶级革命联系在一起，并成为了无产阶级世界革命的一部分。五四运动使中国人民迅速革命化，在思想上、干部上准备了中国共产党的成立和北伐战争。五四运动所开始的中国新民主主义革命，现在正在取得全国范围的胜利。
    五四运动在中国青年运动中的历史地位，使五四被定为中国青年节。五四运动以后，中国的青年继承着五四运动的革命精神，一贯站在革命的前列。在中国共产党成立之前，一九二○年中国革命青年就成立了中国社会主义青年团。在北伐战争和土地革命战争中，中国青年都积极参加了革命的斗争。一九三五年的“一二九”青年运动揭开了抗日战争的序幕。在八年的抗日战争中，和三年来的人民解放战争中，青年无论在前线或后方、解放区或国民党统治区，都起了重要的作用。随着中国革命的胜利，中国青年运动进入了空前的全国大高潮。中国青年在新中国的建设事业中无疑将作更伟大的贡献。
    五四运动又是中国前所未有的文化革命运动。在五四运动以前，以“新青年”杂志为中心的一批中国知识分子，即向旧道德，旧文学，封建迷信思想展开进攻，提倡新道德，提倡民主，提倡科学，提倡白话文和平民文学。以李大钊为代表的运动中的左翼，并开始宣传鼓吹马克思、列宁主义，把共产主义的思想传播到中国来，使文化战线上的斗争走上新时期。在“五四”以前，所有学校与科举之争，新学与旧学之争，西学与中学之争等等，都只是资产阶级的新文化与封建主义的旧文化之争。“五四”以后，文化战线上的斗争就成为了历史唯物论和辩证唯物论所领导的人民民主的新文化与唯心论和形式主义的封建主义文化、帝国主义文化的斗争。在这个斗争中，以胡适为代表的原来运动中的右翼的资产阶级的知识分子，后来投到了反革命的文化阵营中去，或者退出了战斗，消声匿迹。但是日益以马克思、列宁主义的革命理论和中国革命实际斗争经验武装起来的革命阵营迅速壮大，以所向无敌之势，在社会科学领域中，在文学艺术领域中，都取得伟大的胜利。
    但是象政治方面一样，五四文化革命运动的弱点是没有能普及到广大的工人、农民群众中去，因此，五四和五四以后的革命文化的根基还是薄弱的。在反革命统治之下，中国革命文化虽然取得了巨大的成绩，但是还不足以完全击败帝国主义文化、封建主义文化并取而代之。只有在中国人民解放区，这个建立完全崭新的新民主主义文化的任务才得到实现。在解放区，不论在土地革命战争时期或抗日战争和人民解放战争时期。文化运动在与工农兵相结合的方面上作了重大的努力。特别是经过毛泽东同志发表了新民主主义论，经过延安文艺界座谈会和整风运动后，纠正了错误的偏向，确立了鲜明的方针，更使解放区的新文化在几年来获得了蓬勃的发展。现在，在胜利的中国革命的形势下，这种人民民主的文化正排除一切帝国主义文化和封建主义文化而占领着文化领域中的全面阵地。
