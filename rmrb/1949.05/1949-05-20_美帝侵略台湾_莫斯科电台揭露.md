Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 19th: Moscow Radio broadcast a commentary by Pitersky on the 15th, exposing the U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan. The commentary began by stating: "The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has shattered all plans of the U.S. ruling authorities. The attempt by U.S. monopoly capitalists to turn this large country with nearly 500 million people into an American colony has gone bankrupt. However, the United States has not completely stopped interfering in China's internal affairs. The U.S. aggressors are intensifying their aggression against Taiwan, attempting to turn Taiwan into the largest U.S. naval and air base, which is a proof."

The article cited facts, saying: "The Chicago Tribune reported on April 19th that many American planes have arrived in Taiwan again. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reported on May 9th that new American warships have sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan. The New York Herald Tribune published an article by a person named Auslook on February 15th, in which he clearly stated the U.S. monopoly capitalists' aggressive plans for this island of China. He openly suggested invading Taiwan and said that for this purpose, a peace treaty should be concluded between Taiwan and Japan. U.S. State Department spokesman McDermott actually expressed his support for Auslook's suggestion. McDermott said at a reception: 'Taiwan's fate lies with Japan.' Thus, the purpose of the U.S. State Department is clear at a glance. They seem to have forgotten the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Conference stipulating that Taiwan should be returned to China."

The commentary said: "U.S. imperialism is turning Taiwan into an American base, primarily to prepare for opposition against the Chinese people." The commentary concluded by pointing out: "The Chinese people and the people of Taiwan will never allow the U.S. aggressors and their Chinese running dogs to swallow Taiwan."

　　美帝侵略台湾
  　莫斯科电台揭露
    【新华社北平十九日电】莫斯科电台十五日广播皮特尔斯基的评论揭露美帝国主义对台湾的侵略评论首称：中国人民解放军的胜利，打破了美国执政当局的一切计划。美国独占资本家想把这拥有几乎五万万人口的大国变成美国殖民地的企图遭到了破产。但美国并未完全停止干涉中国内政，美国侵略分子正在加紧侵略台湾，企图把台湾变成美国最大的海空军基地，就是一个证明。该文列举事实说：美国芝加哥论坛报四月十九日的报道中写道，在台湾又来了许多美国飞机。上海大公报五月九日报道：新的美国军舰从上海开到了台湾。二月十五日纽约先驱论坛报登载了一个叫奥斯罗克的一篇文章，其中明显的说出美国独占资本家对中国这个海岛的侵略计划。他公开建议侵略台湾，并且说，为此目的应当利用台湾和日本缔结和约。美国务院发言人麦克谟德实际表示赞同奥斯罗克的建议，麦克谟德在一个招待会上说：台湾的命运在于日本。这样，美国国务院的目的就一目了然了。他们似乎忘记了开罗宣言和波茨顿会议规定将台湾归还中国。评论说：美帝国主义把台湾变成美国基地，首先是用来准备反对中国人民的。评论最后指出：中国人民和台湾人民是决不会听任美国侵略者及其中国走狗去吞食台湾的。
