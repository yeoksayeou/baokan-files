    Organize to Prevent Drought and Prepare for Famine
    ——Labor Organization in Drought Prevention and Famine Preparation in Longjiapu, Yi County, Yi County
    Longjiapu consists of twelve natural villages, with a total of 108 households and 441 people. Among them, there are 96 fully capable male laborers, 38 semi-capable male laborers, 60 scattered male laborers, 83 fully capable female laborers, 47 semi-capable female laborers, and 54 scattered female laborers. They have organized twelve male work-exchange groups, four semi-capable labor work-exchange groups, and nine women's work-exchange groups. The village has 96 mu of garden land, 804 mu of dry land, and 305 mu of hillside land.
    Since this spring, the work-exchange groups in this village have been working hard to rush planting and water the gardens, actively fighting against the drought. They proposed to ensure planting even if it doesn't rain, and to increase grain production by one dou more than last year. Each household revised its production plan, implemented the spirit of planting various special crops and using work-exchange to carry water for spot planting to overcome the drought. They also grasped the principle of not wasting time according to household plans and the urgency of the work, as well as the distance of the terrain. The whole village put forward "three non-idles": (1) all labor is not idle; (2) wells are not idle; (3) furniture is not idle. Each household also put forward the slogan of "three non-idles": (1) fully capable labor is not idle; (2) semi-capable labor is not idle; (3) scattered labor is not idle.
    This spring, they used work-exchange teams as units, and the groups exchanged labor to plant 530 mu of Chinese yams, 80 mu of cotton (last year 30 mu), and 30 mu of peanuts. Immediately following this, they carried water to spot-plant 170 mu of corn. The seedlings have all emerged nicely. However, 35 mu of cotton, 110 mu of Chinese yams, and 40 mu of corn were affected by wind damage. They quickly carried water to replant the missing seedlings. After overcoming the drought and completing the planting, because it hadn't rained for a long time and the seedlings showed signs of drought, they used more than 800 workdays to water for the second time within seven days, followed by two rounds of weeding. When it came to wheat harvesting, the women's work-exchange groups issued a challenge, guaranteeing that this year's wheat harvest, in addition to men transporting it to the threshing ground, would be entirely borne by the women. This freed up male labor to rush planting, planting as they harvested, ensuring that all the wheat stubble would be planted after harvesting. The village has 25 mu of potatoes, which recently had a problem with "new wives" eating the leaves. Twenty-one children were organized into five groups, and this work was also entirely borne by the children. Their fight against the drought was a victory, achieving great results. In total, they planted 530 mu of cotton and sweet potatoes, 20 mu of tobacco (last year 3 mu), 50 mu of large and small wheat, 30 mu of peanuts, 35 mu of potatoes, 110 mu of corn, and a total of over 800 mu of special crops such as hemp and indigo, accounting for 74 percent of the village's irrigated and dry land.
    The work-exchange groups worked fiercely, creating a bustling work-exchange movement in the twelve natural villages. From the spring equinox to the beginning of summer, they were constantly exchanging labor. Some individuals exchanged labor for as many as 47 days. The men in the whole village exchanged a total of 4,396 workdays (the village has a total of 194 men, with an average of 22 workdays exchanged per person).
    The women's work-exchange groups, in addition to participating in necessary agriculture, spun thread, made soles for shoes, and dismantled and washed military uniforms, and similarly carried out work-exchange, totaling 5,423 workdays (spinning cotton alone accounted for 5,140 workdays). This shows that the development of sideline occupations in this village is quite widespread and active.
    The organizational form of the work-exchange groups in this village is combined with the militia groups, service groups, and farmers' association groups. One person serves as the group leader, and there are also study group leaders and military group leaders. During production breaks, they learn to bury landmines. Now all the men participating in work-exchange in the village have learned to bury landmines.
    Each group is carrying out work-exchange enthusiastically. A household has one laborer who can do anything, and the principle of equal value is well grasped.
    (Editor's note: If this village is truly organized according to the principles of voluntarism and equal value, then this spirit and method of overcoming drought are worth learning from in all regions.)

    组织起来防旱备荒
    ——易县龙家铺防旱备荒中的劳力组织
    龙家铺共十二个自然村，全村一百零八户，四百四十一人，男全劳动力九十六个，半劳动力三十八个，零散劳动力六十个，女全劳动力八十三个，半劳动力四十七个，零散劳动力五十四个。他们组织了十二个男拨工组，四个半劳动力拨工组，九个妇女拨工组，全村有园地九十六亩、旱地八百零四亩、坡地三百零五亩。
    这村拨工组自今春以来，就努力突击播种、浇园，与旱灾主动的进行了斗争，提出保证不下雨也要种上，比去年还要增加一斗粮食，各户重新修改了自己的生产计划，贯彻了多种特种作物和利用拨工挑水点种，克服旱灾的精神，并掌握了按户计划和按活紧松和地形远近不浪费时间，全村提出三不闲：（一）所有劳动力不闲；（二）井不闲；（三）家具不闲。每户亦提出三不闲的口号：（一）全劳动力不闲；（二）半劳动力不闲；（三）零散劳动力不闲。
    他们在今春以拨工分队为单位，组与组变工来栽山药五百三十亩、植棉八十亩（去年三十亩）、花生三十亩，紧接着担水点种一百七十亩棒子。小苗也很齐全的出来了。但有棉花三十五亩，山药一百一十亩，棒子四十亩受了风灾，他们很快即担水将缺苗补充上了。他们在克服天旱完成了播种后，因天久不下雨，苗已显旱，在七天之内又用八百多工浇了第二次，接着锄了二遍，到麦收时妇女拨工组提出挑战，保证今年麦收除用男人运到场外，拔打全部由妇女负担，这样省出男劳动力抢种，拔一片种一片，保证拔完麦茬也全种上。该村有山药蛋二十五亩，近来发生“花媳妇”吃叶子，将儿童二十一人组织起来分为五组，这一工作又由儿童全部负担起来，他们和旱灾的斗争是胜利了，获得很大成绩。总计种棉和红薯五百三十亩，烟二十亩（去年三亩），大小麦五十亩，花生三十亩，山药蛋三十五亩，棒子一百一十亩，和麻靛等特种作物共计八百余亩，占全村水旱地百分之七十四。
    工拨工干得凶，在十二个自然村中都造成了热火朝天的拨工运动，由春分到立夏，都是相互拨工，有的一个人拨到四十七个，全村男的共拨工四千三百九十六个（全村共男一百九十四人，每人平均拨工二十二个）。
    妇女拨工组除参加必要农业外，纺线纳底拆洗军衣，同样进行了拨工，共拨工五千四百二十三个（只纺棉花就占五千一百四十个），这说明这村妇女在副业开展上是相当普遍和活跃了。
    这村拨工组是和民兵小组、勤务小组、农会小组合在一起的组织形式，小组长一人担任，另设学习组长和军事组长，在生产休息时学埋地雷，现在全村参加拨工的男子全学会埋地雷了。
    各组都是轰轰烈烈的拨工，一户有一个劳动力，什么也能干，对等价的原则掌握得很好。
    （编者按：如该村真正是根据自愿、等价的原则来组织起来，这种战胜旱灾的精神和办法，均值得各地学习。）
