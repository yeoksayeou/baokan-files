　　Comrade Li Lisan Talks About the "May Thirtieth" Movement
　　Our reporter Bai Sheng
　　Shanghai was liberated on the eve of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the "May Thirtieth" Movement. Twenty-four years ago, imperialists massacred Chinese workers and students in Shanghai, creating the "May Thirtieth" Massacre that shook the entire country. Now, Shanghai belongs to the people forever, and the great goal of overthrowing imperialist rule in China, which the "May Thirtieth" Movement aimed at, has been gradually realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. At this most memorable and celebratory moment, our reporter specially interviewed Comrade Li Lisan, one of the leaders of the "May Thirtieth" Movement at the time.
　　Comrade Lisan said: In the past, the Chinese working class and laboring people always commemorated "May Thirtieth" with great sorrow. "May Thirtieth" was the day, May 30, 1925, when Shanghai workers, students, and citizens suffered bloody massacres and brutal oppression by British and Japanese imperialists. This year, the situation is completely different. Shanghai has been liberated on the eve of "May Thirtieth." Workers, students, and citizens can commemorate "May Thirtieth" on their own land. Not only has the demand for the recovery of concessions put forward by "May Thirtieth" been fully realized, but also the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, which has enslaved the Chinese people for more than a hundred years, has completely ended, officially ending, and from then on, a new history of liberation and freedom for the Chinese people has begun. Comrade Lisan said happily: This year, when commemorating "May Thirtieth," I would like to congratulate the liberation of Shanghai's workers, students, and citizens. I believe that they will soon hold a grand demonstration on "May Thirtieth Blood Road" (ie, Nanjing Road), where workers, students, and citizens shed their blood in 1925, to celebrate their victory; The people of China will also celebrate the liberation of Shanghai with the same joyous mood.
　　The "May Thirtieth" Movement Formed the Beginning of the First Great Revolution in China
　　Comrade Lisan personally led the great strike of 300,000 workers in Shanghai at that time. The reporter specially asked him to talk about the details of the "May Thirtieth" Massacre. Comrade Lisan said: "May Thirtieth" was the result of the barbaric and brutal rule of imperialism over the Chinese people. At that time, not only were Shanghai workers completely in a position of being oppressed and enslaved, suffering high exploitation, and living a life of cattle and horses, but also all the people of Shanghai lived a slave life under imperialist oppression. As everyone knows, the fuse of "May Thirtieth" was the shooting of worker Gu Zhenghong by the Japanese Naigaiwata Cotton Mill in Shanghai. Japanese imperialists did not treat Chinese workers as human beings and shot them to death at will. This incident immediately aroused the workers' strike and resistance, and quickly aroused the sympathy of Shanghai students and citizens. On May 30, a large-scale publicity campaign was held in Shanghai by workers, students, and citizens to support the workers of the Japanese cotton mill and oppose the brutal oppression of imperialism. At the same time, they opposed the four bills of the Shanghai Municipal Council, an organ of imperialist rule in Shanghai, which oppressed the Shanghai citizens. However, the imperialists became even more arrogant, arresting and beating propaganda teams everywhere, which aroused the anger of all Shanghai citizens. Tens of thousands of Shanghai citizens surrounded the police station, demanding the release of the propagandists. The imperialist detectives actually directed the police to fire wildly at the unarmed masses, killing many workers and students. This brutal and beastly act aroused the roar of all the people in Shanghai. On May 31, a citizens' congress was held in Shanghai, unanimously deciding to hold a strike, market strike, and school strike. On June 1, this resolution was fully implemented. The whole of Shanghai was boiling, and then all parts of the country rose up in response, holding anti-imperialist demonstrations. However, the imperialists dared to show their ferocity and used massacre tactics everywhere. Wherever imperialist forces reached, such as Qingdao, Hankou, and Guangzhou, massacres occurred. This aroused the anti-imperialist anger of all the Chinese people. Therefore, the "May Thirtieth" Movement formed the beginning of the first great revolution in China.
　　The Working Class Fully Demonstrated that it was the Vanguard of Anti-Imperialism in the "May Thirtieth" Movement
　　Comrade Lisan said that the struggle of the "May Thirtieth" Movement was the first anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese people in which the Chinese working class played a leading role. The spirit of the working class in the "May Thirtieth" Movement and the ensuing Great Strike of Hong Kong and Guangzhou, who persisted to the end and fought bravely from beginning to end, fully demonstrated that they were the vanguard and leader of the Chinese people's anti-imperialism. The leading organization of the Shanghai "May Thirtieth" Movement was the "Federation of Workers, Students, and Merchants," which was jointly composed of representatives of workers, students, and merchants in Shanghai. This was a prototype of the people's representative conference. In the early stage of the "May Thirtieth" struggle, Chinese compradores, bureaucrats, and big bourgeoisie, under the compulsion of the broad masses, had to agree to a market strike, but soon betrayed this revolutionary struggle and united with the imperialists to undermine the movement. Although the movement ultimately failed, it made the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country more clearly realize that without overthrowing imperialism, China has no future, and at the same time, they realized that the Chinese feudal forces and the bureaucratic compradors and big bourgeoisie are completely the running dogs of imperialism, and without overthrowing their rule, true national liberation cannot be obtained. Therefore, not long after "May Thirtieth," the Great Revolution of 1927 occurred. During the Great Revolution, the Shanghai workers carried out a heroic struggle for the second time and held three uprisings. However, the bureaucratic comprador and big bourgeoisie, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, surrendered to imperialism under the threat of the US imperialists' shelling of Nanjing. This led to the failure of the Great Revolution of 1927, causing the Chinese people to suffer more than 20 years of imperialist oppression. In these more than 20 years, the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, united the people of the whole country to carry out the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and are about to achieve complete victory. The day when the people of China will be completely liberated is coming soon.
　　In the Future, the Working Class Should Strive to Develop Production to Commemorate "May Thirtieth"
　　Finally, Comrade Lisan emphasized that this year, when the working class commemorates "May Thirtieth," the imperialist rule in China has collapsed with the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary government. However, it should be noted that China is an industrially backward country, and if industry cannot be greatly developed, it will still not be able to completely get rid of the economic constraints of imperialism. Therefore, the most important task facing the Chinese people, especially the workers, is to restore and develop production, develop industry, and transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, so as to ensure the complete liberation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese working class has now changed from an enslaved class to a leading class. It should take on this arduous and great task, be good at uniting the people of the whole country, and strive to achieve this great task. I believe that the Chinese working class, after decades of arduous struggle, has gained a high degree of awareness and rich experience, especially because it has the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, and will surely successfully complete the task of building a new China.

　　李立三同志谈“五卅”
    本报记者柏生
    上海在“五卅”二十四周年的前夕解放了。二十四年前，帝国主义者在上海残杀中国工人学生，造成震动全国的“五卅”惨案。现在，上海已永远归于人民所有，“五卅”运动所指向的推翻帝国主义在中国统治的伟大目标，已在中国共产党的领导下次第实现了。在这种最值得纪念与庆贺的时候，记者特地访问了当时“五卅”运动领导者之一的李立三同志。
    立三同志说：在过去，中国工人阶级和劳动人民总是非常沉痛的纪念“五卅”。“五卅”是一九二五年五月三十日，上海工人、学生、市民遭受英日帝国主义血腥屠杀与残酷压迫的日子。今年情况完全不同了，上海已在“五卅”前夕解放，工人、学生、市民可以在自己的土地上纪念“五卅”了。不仅“五卅”提出的收回租界的要求已完全实现，而且百余年来奴辱中国人民的帝国主义及其走狗的统治已完全告终，正式结束了，从此开辟了中国人民解放自由的新历史。立三同志愉快的说：今年纪念“五卅”，我愿意祝贺上海工人、学生、市民的解放，我相信他们最近一定会兴高采烈的在一九二五年流了工人、学生、市民鲜血的“五卅血”路（即南京路）上举行纪念“五卅”的大示威，庆祝自己的胜利；全中国的人民也会以同样欢快的心情，庆祝上海的解放。
　　“五卅”运动形成了中国第一次大革命的开端
    立三同志当时亲自领导了上海三十万工人的大罢工，记者特别请他谈了些“五卅”惨案的经过情形。立三同志说：“五卅”是帝国主义对中国人民的野蛮残酷统治所造成的结果。当时不仅上海工人完全处于被压迫奴役的地位，受着高度的剥削，过着牛马的生活，就是全上海的人民也都过着帝国主义压迫下的奴隶生活。大家知道“五卅”的导火线是因为上海日本内外棉纱厂枪杀工人顾正红，日本帝国主义者不把中国工人当人看待，随意开枪打死。这件事情立即激起了工人的罢工反抗，并迅速引起了上海学生、市民的同情。五月卅日在上海举行了工人、学生以及市民的大宣传，一致支援日本纱厂工人，反对帝国主义的残暴压迫。同时反对帝国主义统治上海的机关工部局压迫上海市民的四个法案。但是，帝国主义者却更加横蛮，到处逮捕殴打宣传队，因此引起全上海市民的愤怒，数万上海市民包围了巡捕房，要求释放宣传员，帝国主义的捕头竟指挥巡捕向赤手空拳的群众疯狂开枪，打死了不少工人和学生。这种残暴兽行引起全上海人民的怒吼。五月三十一日，全上海市民举行了市民大会，一致决定举行罢工、罢市、罢课。六月一日，这一决议就已完全实现。全上海都沸腾起来了，接着全国各地都纷起响应，举行反帝国主义的示威运动，但是，帝国主义竟敢逞其凶恶到处使用屠杀手段。凡是帝国主义势力达到的地方，象青岛、汉口、广州等地，都发生了惨案。这就激起了全中国人民反帝的怒潮，因此“五卅”运动形成了中国第一次大革命的开端。
  　工人阶级在“五卅”运动中完全表现了是反帝的先锋队
    立三同志说，“五卅”运动的斗争，是中国工人阶级第一次起了领导作用的全中国人民的反帝斗争。工人阶级在“五卅”运动和继之而起的省港大罢工中自始至终坚持到底英勇奋斗的精神，完全表现了自己是中国人民反帝的先锋队和领导者。上海“五卅”运动的领导机构是“工、学、商联合会”，这是由上海的工人、学生、商人代表联合组成的，这是人民代表会议的一个雏型。在“五卅”斗争初期，中国的买办、官僚、大资产阶级在广大群众的逼迫下，不得不赞成罢市，但不久就叛变了这一革命斗争，与帝国主义联合，破坏了这个运动。这个运动最后虽然失败，却使中国工人阶级和全国人民更加认清了不推翻帝国主义，中国是没有前途的，同时也认清了中国封建势力与官僚买办、大资产阶级完全是帝国主义的走狗，不推翻他们的统治，也无法得到真正的民族解放。所以“五卅”以后不久，就发生了一九二七年的大革命，在大革命时，上海工人又第二次进行了英勇的斗争，举行了三次起义。可是以蒋介石为代表的官僚买办、大资产阶级，在美帝国主义南京开炮的威胁下，向帝国主义投降了。致使一九二七年的大革命遭到失败，使中国人民又多受了二十多年的帝国主义的压迫。在这二十多年中，中国共产党和工人阶级在毛主席的正确领导下团结全国人民进行反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争，已经快要取得完全的胜利，全中国人民获得完全解放的日子，就要到来了。
  　今后工人阶级纪念“五卅”应是努力发展生产
    最后，立三同志强调指出：今年工人阶级纪念“五卅”时，帝国主义在中国的统治是随着国民党反动政府的覆灭而覆灭了，但是应该注意中国是个工业落后的国家，如果工业不能大大发展，还是不能完全摆脱帝国主义经济上的束缚。因此，摆在中国人民特别是工人面前的最主要任务，就是恢复和发展生产，发展工业，把中国从农业国变为工业国，以保障中国民族的彻底解放。中国工人阶级现在已经从奴役地位变为领导阶级，它应该把这个艰巨伟大的任务担负起来，善于团结全国人民，为了实现这个伟大的任务而奋斗。我相信中国工人阶级经过了几十年艰苦斗争的锻炼，已经有了高度的觉悟，丰富的经验，尤其是由于有毛主席的正确领导，一定能胜利的完成建设新中国的任务。
