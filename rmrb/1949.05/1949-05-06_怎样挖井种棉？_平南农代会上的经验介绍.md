    How to Dig Wells and Plant Cotton?
    Experience Introduction from the Pingnan Agricultural Representatives Conference
    How to overcome drought and complete the sowing of special crops on time is an important issue that urgently needs to be resolved in the current production. To this end, the Pingnan Tenth Prefectural Committee specifically issued an "Emergency Mobilization to Dig Wells for Spot Planting and Prevent Drought and Prepare for Famine." Various counties have also recently convened farmers' representative conferences to discuss and study past experiences in digging wells for spot planting, initially dispelling ideological concerns and increasing production confidence. The experiences introduced at the conference regarding digging wells for spot planting are now comprehensively presented below for reference by various regions.
    I. How to Dig a Well?
    There are various methods for digging wells, and different digging methods should be adopted depending on the soil quality of each region. The digging method for quicksand areas generally adopts the following methods: One method is to weave a wicker circle or willow circle the same size as the well curb. When the water is about to be reached, lower the circle into the well, and as you dig downward, press the wicker circle downward, and surround the outside of the wicker circle with mats. This can avoid the collapse of quicksand. Another method is to make reed ropes and lower them into the well. As you dig downward, coil the ropes downward and wedge them with wooden wedges, which can also prevent the collapse of quicksand. Such a well generally requires five to seven workdays, and it can be successfully dug to a depth of fourteen or five feet.
    Digging wells in yellow-black soil is easier, and generally no reed ropes or wicker circles are needed. The digging method is: first have one person dig a dry well curb (one person can dig it in one day), and then use four or five people to dig it together, which can be completed in about half a day. In total, only six or seven workdays are needed to complete a well. Digging such a well can be used to spot plant cotton and peanuts on twenty to twenty-five mu. The form of the well is generally three feet in diameter at the top, expanding to one and a half feet in the middle, and then shrinking back to three feet when water is reached, forming a jar shape. This makes the bottom small and not easy to damage, and the middle large for convenient water drawing. Where should you dig? It is best to dig in places with many vinegar willows and jointed grass, because these places are prone to produce water.
    II. How to Plant Cotton in Dry and Alkaline Land?
    In the past, farmers rarely planted cotton in dry and alkaline land, so cotton was often not planted when the cotton planting season arrived. However, some farmers have experience in planting cotton in dry and alkaline land. The method is: watering for spot planting. The planting method for dry land is: first use a plow or harrow to move the dry soil on the surface to both sides, loosen the subsoil, then use a hoe to dig pits, put in cotton seeds, step them flat, then water them, and then seal a layer of loose soil on top. The advantages of this method are: cotton seeds can often be close to moist soil, and the moisture is maintained longer than watering first and then planting. And the buds emerge from the soil faster. The planting method for alkaline land is: first scrape the alkaline soil on the surface to one side, dig pits half a foot deep with an iron shovel, loosen the soil in the pits, and water them so that the alkali in the soil can seep down with the water. Then put in the seeds and cover with soil, so that it can germinate and emerge from the soil as quickly as good land.
    III. How to Care for Cotton?
    After cotton is planted, the quality of care is closely related to the amount of cotton harvested. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the management of cotton. The care methods are: (1) After the cotton seedlings emerge from the soil, they should be hoeed once to maintain moisture for a longer time. If the land is too dry, in order to prevent the seedlings from being harmed, you can drill a four- or five-inch deep hole on one side of the cotton plant with a wooden peg, pour in water and cover it with soil. This will allow the cotton seedlings to regularly absorb water and resist drought for a month. (2) When spot planting during drought, do not apply fertilizer at the same time. Wait until the cotton seedlings are strong before topdressing. Because if fertilizer is applied at that time, the water applied will be absorbed by the fertilizer, and the seedlings are easily harmed when the fertilizer ferments. (3) For land planted with cotton for the first year, pay attention to tidying up (topping and ear picking, etc.) to avoid growing crazy seedlings. However, early planting should be topped later to avoid damage from wind and hail. Late planting should be topped earlier, leaving fewer branches and stems, so that the cotton nutrients are concentrated, develop and mature quickly, and more cotton can be picked. (Zhao Gang)

    怎样挖井种棉？
    平南农代会上的经验介绍
    如何战胜天旱，按时完成特种作物的播种，这是当前生产中急待解决的重要问题。为此，平南十地委特发出“紧急动员起来，打井点种，防旱备荒的指示”。各县亦于最近召开了农民代表大会。讨论研究已往打井点种的经验，初步解除了思想顾虑，提高了生产信心。现将会上介绍的打井点种的经验综合介绍如下，以供各地参考。
    一、怎样挖井？
    挖井的方法不一，主要应根据各地土质的不同，采取不同的挖法。流沙地的挖法，大体上采用以下办法：一种是用荆条或柳条编成与井桶大小相同的笆圈，快挖出水时，将圈下到井内，随向下挖随向下按笆圈，并在笆圈外围上席，这样可避免流沙的坍塌。另一种办法是用苇子打成缏绳下在井内，随向下挖随向下盘缏，并用木楔楔好，这样亦可避免流沙坍塌。这种井，一般的需用五至七个工，挖一丈四五尺深即可成功。
    黄黑土地挖井较容易，一般的不用缏绳和笆圈。挖法是：先有一人挖干井桶（一人一天即可挖成），然后再用四五个人共同来挖，约有半天时间即可挖成。总共只用六七个工，一天半时间就可完成一眼井。挖这样一眼井，能点种棉花、花生二十亩至二十五亩。井的形式，大体是上口直径三尺，当中扩大到一尺半，挖出水时，再缩小到三尺，成为坛子形，这样下面小不易坏，当中大打水方便。在什么地方挖呢？最好在长醋醋柳和节节草多的地方，因为这些地方容易出水。
    二、干、碱地如何种棉？
    已往农民很少在干地、碱地里种棉，因此，往往到了种棉季节棉花种不上。但亦有部份农民有在干地、碱地种棉的经验。办法是：浇水点种。干地的种法：首先用犁或耠子将表面的干土弄到两边，将底土翻松，再用镐刨成坑，下上棉籽，用脚踏平后再浇水，然后在上面封上层松土。这样种的好处：棉籽能常靠近湿土，比先浇水后下种水分保持的长久。并且芽发出土较快。碱地的种法，首先将表面的碱土刮到一边，用铁锨掘成半尺深的坑，将坑内土弄松浇上水，使土内之碱可随水渗下。然后下上种封上土，这样能和好地同样的发芽出土快。
    三、怎样保育棉花？
    棉花种上后，保育的好坏，与棉花的收多收少有很大关系。因此，必须重视棉花的保管。保育的办法：（一）棉苗出土后，应先锄一遍，以保持水分的长久。如地太干时，为防止幼苗受害，可在棉棵一边用木橛钻一个四五寸深的洞，灌上水用土盖好，这样能使棉苗经常吸收到水分，能抗旱一个月。（二）天旱点种时，不要同时上粪，待棉苗发育壮大后再追肥。因为当时上了粪，点的水就被粪吸去了，而且粪一发酵，棉苗易受害。（三）头一年种棉的地，要注意收拾（打尖摘耳等），以免长疯秧。但早种的要晚打尖，以免受风雹之害。晚种的应早打尖，少留枝干，使棉花养料集中，发育成熟快，可多摘棉花。（赵刚）
