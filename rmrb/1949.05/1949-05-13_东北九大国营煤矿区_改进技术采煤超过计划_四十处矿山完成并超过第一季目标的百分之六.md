Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: The forty mines under the nine major state-owned coal mining areas, which are under the jurisdiction of the Coal Mine Administration of the Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, have completed and exceeded their coal mining plans for the first quarter (January, February, and March) of this year. The total coal mined throughout the quarter was 1,794,255 tons, exceeding the original planned total of 1,696,000 tons by six percent. In terms of transportation, the original plan was to transport 1,383,000 tons of coal in the first quarter, but the actual amount transported was over 1,480,000 tons, also exceeding the original plan by seven percent. This is the result of over 100,000 workers and staff improving coal mining methods and launching enthusiastic production campaigns. The performance of mines in Northern Manchuria, which already had a better foundation, was particularly remarkable. Workers at the First Coal Mining Area have been continuously carrying out various competition campaigns since the New Year, and their production enthusiasm is extremely high. The average daily output per person in the mining area during the first quarter was 0.49 tons, exceeding the 0.3 tons during the puppet Manchukuo period by 39 percent. Individual mines even reached a record high of 0.7 tons. The Second Coal Mining Area also achieved excellent results due to the launch of enthusiastic competition, mining 390,000 tons of coal, exceeding the original plan by five percent. During the competition, all mines paid attention to eliminating stones (stones mixed in with the coal), preventing accidents, saving labor and materials, and improving production efficiency. The main task of the Southern Manchuria mines is still to recover, because they were only recently taken over and were severely damaged by the Kuomintang. In order to restore production in the mining area as soon as possible, the workers and staff of the Fushun Mining Area launched a widespread campaign to donate equipment in January, contributing more than 20,000 pieces of equipment worth approximately 3 billion Northeast currency, which ensured the smooth progress of the mining area's recovery work. The recovery work in the Fuxin Coal Mining Area is also progressing rapidly, with most mine entrances having resumed coal production, increasing from a daily output of 1,800 tons to over 4,000 tons. In terms of coal quality, with the exception of individual mines where the quality was relatively poor due to insufficient inspection and unclear systems, the phenomenon of large stones mixed in with the coal has generally been eliminated in most mining areas. In the first quarter's production and recovery work, many mines still had some shortcomings in management and technical guidance. For example, irrational labor allocation and insufficient technical guidance affected the reduction of coal output. Some mines did not pay enough attention to safety equipment, resulting in some accidents. The second quarter (April, May, and June) coal mining work in each mining area is now underway. Based on the experience of the previous quarter, the production efficiency of this quarter will be further improved, with a planned coal mining output of 2,073,000 tons.

    东北九大国营煤矿区
    改进技术采煤超过计划
    四十处矿山完成并超过第一季目标的百分之六
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北行政委员会工业部煤矿管理局所属九大国营煤矿区的四十处矿山，已完成并超过今年第一季（一、二、三月）采煤计划。全季采煤总量为一百七十九万四千二百五十五吨，较原计划一百六十九万六千吨的总量超过百分之六。在运输方面，原计划第一季运出煤一百三十八万三千吨，实际则运出一百四十八万余吨，亦超过原计划百分之七。这是十万余职工改进采煤方法和普遍展开热烈的生产竞赛的结果。工作已有较好基础的北满各矿，成绩尤为显著。第一煤矿区的工友，自新年以来，即连续开展各种竞赛运动，生产热情极高。该矿区第一季每人每天的平均生产率为○·四九吨，超过伪满时期○·三吨的百分之三十九。有个别矿则达到○·七吨的最高纪录。第二煤矿区亦由于开展了热烈的竞赛，采煤三十九万吨，超过原计划百分之五。在竞赛中各矿均注意了消灭石头（煤炭中夹带石头），防止事故，节省劳动力及材料，提高了生产效能。南满各矿，因接管不久，又曾遭国民党的严重破坏，目前主要工作仍在进行恢复。抚顺矿区职工，为使矿区早日恢复生产，于一月间展开了广泛的献纳器材运动，共献出器材二万件以上，约值东北币三十亿元，保证了该矿区恢复工作的顺利进行。阜新煤矿区的恢复工作，亦进展甚快，大部坑口都恢复出煤，已由日产量一千八百吨，提高到四千吨以上。在煤质上，除个别矿因检查不够和制度不明以致质量较差外，大部矿区一般已消灭了煤炭中夹杂大块石头的现象。在第一季生产与恢复工作中，尚有许多矿山在管理工作及技术指导上，存在着若干缺点。如劳动力调剂不合理及技术指导不够而影响出煤减少等。有些矿则对保安设备注意不够，以致发生若干事故。现各矿区的第二季（四、五、六三个月）采煤工作已在进行，这一季的生产效率，将在接受上季经验的基础上提高一步，计划采煤二百零七万三千吨。
