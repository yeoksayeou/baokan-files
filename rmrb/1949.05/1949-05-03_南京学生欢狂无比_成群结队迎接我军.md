Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 1st. Nanjing students are enthusiastically expressing their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army and launching a propaganda campaign. Students from all universities and colleges in the city have formed a joint association and organized more than 350 propaganda teams to give lectures, perform skits, and stage street dramas on major streets. Among them, more than 250 teams, comprising over 2,000 people, are made up of university students, and 90% of the art school students have participated. Every day, there are gatherings for students and the People's Liberation Army to celebrate together. Students consider it an honor to shake hands and talk with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Many students from Central University and Jinling University have requested to join the work of the People's Liberation Army. Students from Jinling Women's University have organized a condolence group to go to the garrisons of the People's Liberation Army units and ask to help the soldiers mend their clothes. The grand meeting to welcome the People's Liberation Army and celebrate the liberation of Nanjing, prepared by the Nanjing Student Union, is actively underway. Professors from the Art Department of Central University have also joined the preparatory work, and they are rushing to paint huge portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and others. The Nanjing students, who were massacred by the Kuomintang bandits on April 1st, are exuberantly joyful at the rapid arrival of the People's Liberation Army. After the People's Liberation Army liberated Nanjing at midnight on April 23rd, the next morning, students flocked to Taiping Road, Xinjiekou, and other places to welcome the People's Liberation Army entering the city, and some even took cars to Xiaguan to welcome them. On the walls along the streets, students excitedly wrote: "Rest in peace, martyrs of the 'April 1st' massacre! Our own army has arrived." Students who were wounded in the "April 1st" bloodbath and were still recuperating in the hospital, were anxious to ask the doctors to let them out to join the welcoming ranks when they heard the slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army on the street. Seriously wounded students ignored the nurses' advice and climbed to the windows on the upper floors to see the ranks of the People's Liberation Army marching on the street. Zhang Mengzhao, a female student who was crippled by the Kuomintang bandits, struggled to sit up from her bed and clamored for the nurses to carry her to the street to talk to the comrades of the People's Liberation Army. The students' enthusiasm has increased day by day with the rapid restoration of order in Nanjing and the People's Liberation Army's kindness and care for them.

    南京学生欢狂无比
    成群结队迎接我军
    【新华社南京一日电】南京学生热烈慰问人民解放军和展开宣传运动。全市大中学校学生已组成联合会，并组织了三百五十多个宣传组，到各主要街道上进行讲演，化装宣传和演出街头剧。其中由各大学学生组成的有二百五十多个组共二千多人，艺专的学生百分之九十都参加了。每天，都有学生和解放军联欢的集会。学生们都以和解放军战士们握手谈话为光荣。中央大学和金陵大学已有很多学生要求参加解放军工作。金陵女子大学的学生组织了慰问组，到解放军各部驻地，请求帮助战士们缝补衣服。南京学生联合会筹备的欢迎解放军，庆祝南京解放的盛会正积极进行中。中央大学艺术系的教授们也参加了这个筹备工作，他们正赶画毛主席、朱总司令等巨幅画像。在四月一日受到国民党匪帮屠杀的南京学生，对解放军的迅速来到真是欢狂无比。在解放军二十三日午夜解放南京后，次日清晨，学生们就成群结队地奔往太平路、新街口等地去迎接入城的解放军，有的并搭了汽车赶往下关迎接。在沿街的墙壁上，学生们激动地写着：“‘四一’殉难的烈士们安息吧！我们自己队伍来了。”在“四一”血案中负伤而还在医院中休养的学生，当他们听到马路上欢迎解放军的口号时，都着急地恳求医生让他们出来参加欢迎的行列。负重伤的学生则不顾护士的劝告，爬到楼上的窗口去看望在马路上行进的解放军的行列。被国民党匪帮打残废的女学生张孟昭，挣扎着从床上坐起来，吵嚷着要护士们把她抬到马路上去和解放军同志们谈谈。学生们的这种热情随着南京秩序的迅速恢复和解放军对他们的亲切和爱护而日益高涨。
