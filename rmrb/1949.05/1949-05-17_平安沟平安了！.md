　　Ping'an Gou is Safe!
　　In the workers' dormitory—inside Ping'an Gou,
　　I met a tall, thin old lady.
　　She asked me, "Can you read?"
　　I said, "Not much, but I can read a letter!"
　　"Good comrade, come and sit in my house,"
　　She said as she pulled me into her home.
　　The cave dwelling was just one room big,
　　A small coal fire burned in the south corner,
　　A bright electric light hung above.
　　She pointed to the
　　Military Family Certificate pasted on the wall and said:
　　"This is my certificate of honor,
　　My second child's name is written on it,
　　With a big red seal in the middle,
　　And Comrade Zhu De sitting at the top
　　—our commander!"
　　She got closer to me,
　　And said more warmly:
　　"Comrade!
　　I was really unenlightened before,
　　Afraid that my son would be mistreated in the army.
　　This time I went to see him,
　　I saw it with my own eyes.
　　He is really happy in the army,
　　No matter the officer or the soldier, they are warm,
　　Just like real brothers!
　　He said he had made progress,
　　And his timidity had turned into courage.
　　On the front line,
　　He opened his cotton coat, wore a single shirt,
　　Fixed his bayonet, and charged forward!"
　　I asked, "Aren't you afraid, son?"
　　He said, "Fighting is all for us!
　　When I think of the suffering we endured before,
　t wait to grab the reactionaries
　　And cut them into a thousand pieces!"
　　She said, lowering her head sadly,
　　And my heart felt a surge of bitterness.
　　I asked her, "In the past year or two,
　　How have the workers in the Gou lived?"
　　She waved her hand and shook her head:
　　"I can't mention it, it's too painful to talk about!
　　Comrade,
　　These years have almost ruined this Gou…
　　Alas! The mad dogs were starving,
　　Coming to scrape oil from us…
　　Again and again, it never ended,
　　In the end, just the door tax
　　Was one million a month.
　　The landlords flaunted their power,
　　We lived in this tiny cave the size of a butt,
　　And the landlord still demanded two sheng of wheat a month.
　　After liberation, they didn't dare to say anything openly,
　　But they said secretly: 'Give me a thousand whole,
　　I'm having difficulties, help me out.'
　　I said, 'I don't have any money on hand,'
　　In my heart, I said, 'I'm not afraid of you old demon,
　　Wait a few days until everyone has turned over,
　　Then we'll settle accounts with you!'
　　The stubborn ones were really cowards,
　　If they couldn't get the grain and money,
　　They would randomly grab soldiers in the factory,
　　Many young workers were arrested,
　　And the machines in the mine stopped working;
　　Jackals were in power and didn't reason,
　　Disturbing the peace of the world!
　　My eldest son worked in the mine all year round,
　　Afraid of being drafted,
　　I sent him outside to escape."
　　The old lady coughed and said again:
　　"It would take three days to tell all the bitter things,
　　It's heartbreaking whenever I think of them!"
　　I interjected:
　　"Auntie, the bitter days are over,
　　The future will not be difficult!"
　　She suddenly smiled and said:
　　"These two or three months after liberation
　　Are worlds apart from before liberation:
　　Before, we didn't get paid and starved,
　　Now we have food and drink;
　　Before, the workers had no one to rely on,
　　Now we have a home,
　　And that home is the Communist Party.
　　Before, the dogs wouldn't let us turn on the electric lights,
　　They took out the light bulbs and glared at us,
　　Saying—
　　A mud cave is only fit for an oil lamp?
　　Comrade, we dig coal, we grind electricity,
　　Isn't everything done by us workers?
　　Sweating and suffering,
　　And the capitalists sit and enjoy the benefits?
　　Now, the dark world has been driven away,
　　And our workers' dormitory is as bright as day.
　　I say, Comrade!
　　Winter is over and spring is warm,
　　Before, this place was so chaotic,
　　Now our Ping'an Gou is finally safe!"
　　This honest old mother,
　　Excitedly clapped her hands and said:
　　"Great liberation, great turning over,
　　The Communist Party saved us workers!
　　I'll send a letter to my eldest son,
　　Tell him to come back and go down the mine again,
　　Tell him: 'We'll never be afraid of being drafted again,
　　The world has become our own!'
　　With the big stone slab removed from my head,
　　Comrade, when I walk,
　　I can also straighten my chest and back!"

### 平安沟平安了！

　　平安沟平安了！
    倥
    在工人宿舍——平安沟里边，
    我见到一位细高个子的老太太。
    她问我：“你识字不识字？”
    我说：“识不多，有个书信还能念！”
    “好同志，来俺家坐坐哇，”
    她说着就拉我进了家。
    那窑子不过一间大，
    靠南烧一笼小煤火，
    一只雪亮的电灯在上边挂。
    她指着墙上贴着的那张
    军人家属证明书说：
    “这是我的光荣证，
    上边写着俺二孩的名，
    当间盖着大红印，
    顶头坐着朱德同志
    ——咱的带兵司令！”
    她挨近我，
    更亲热的说：
    “同志呀！
    我早先心里真不开化，
    只怕儿在队上受刻打。
    这一回去看他，
    我亲眼见到啦。
    他在队里真高兴，
    不论官和兵，热呼呼的
    好比亲弟兄！
    他说他进步啦，
    胆小也变成胆大。
    在火线上，
    他撩开棉袄，穿件单褂，
    上起刺刀，直往前打！”
    我问：“孩呀你不害怕？”
    他说：“打仗全是为咱！
    想起从前受的罪来，
    只想把反动派
    一把抓过来，千刀万刮！”
    她说赚沉痛地把头低下，
    我的心里一阵酸麻。
    我问她：“这一二年来，
    沟里的工人怎样过活？”
    她摆摆手摇摇头：
    “没法提，提起就难受！
    同志呵，
    这几年快糟蹋完这条沟……
    唉！疯狗们饿急啦，
    来俺身上刮油水……
    一回一回永没完，
    到后来，光门头捐
    一月就是一百万。
    地主们仗势抖威风，
    俺住这屁股大的小窑洞，
    地主一月还要麦子二升。
    解放啦，他们明里不敢吭，
    暗地说：‘一月给上一千整，
    俺困难，帮帮俺的光景。’
    我嘴说：‘手边没哪钱，’
    心里说：‘可不怕你个老妖精，
    等几天大伙翻了身，
    咱才跟你把理评！
    顽固们真孬种，
    粮款要不上
    就到厂里乱抓兵，
    好多年轻工人被抓走，
    矿里的机器也停了工；
    豺狼当道不讲理，
    扰的天下不太平！
    俺老大常年干窑活，
    怕抓丁
    我打发他外头去逃命。”
    老太太咳了一声又说：
    “苦事情三天也说不完，
    啥时想起啥时心酸！”
    我跟着插了一句：
    “大娘呀，苦日子熬过啦，
    往后的光景就不作难！”
    她忽然笑了，她说：
    “解放后这两三个月，
    跟解放前有天地之隔：
    早先不发工资饿肚皮，
    如今有吃又有喝；
    早先工人没依靠，
    如今俺才有家了，
    这家就是共产党。
    早先狗子不叫俺按电灯，
    摘了灯泡还把眼瞪，
    说什么——
    土窑里只趁点油灯？
    同志，俺刨炭，俺磨电，
    哪样不是俺工人弄？
    流尽汗，受尽苦，
    资本家坐着享现成？
    如今呀，黑暗世界赶跑啦，
    俺这工人宿舍白天黑日一样明。
    我说同志呀！
    冬天过去春天暖，
    早先这地方多慌乱，
    如今俺这平安沟里才平安！”
    这位诚实的老母亲，
    兴奋地拍着手说：
    “大解放，大翻身，
    共产党救活了俺工人！
    我给俺大孩把信捎，
    叫他快回来再下窑，
    给他说：‘永不怕抓兵啦，
    天下变成咱自己了！’
    掀掉头上的大石板，
    同志，我走步路
    也敢挺起胸脯直起腰！”
