Beiping Locomotive Depot Implements Responsibility System; Locomotive Lifespan Extended

[Our dispatch] The Beiping Locomotive Depot implemented a responsibility system starting March 25th. At that time, there were twenty-one locomotives. Due to insufficient personnel, the initial allocation was two crews for every locomotive across eighteen locomotives. From April 15th, the personnel situation improved. The allocation was changed to three crews per locomotive. The work is divided, with each crew consisting of one driver, one fireman, and one apprentice fireman. A driver leader and a learning group leader are selected from the three crews. In late April, Harbin dispatched another locomotive, the "Harbin" locomotive, bringing the total to twenty-two. The work of the train crews has also changed: in addition to driving the train, they are also responsible for tasks such as wiping down the locomotive, lubricating it, lighting the fire, and removing the ashes. At the same time, they are also responsible for the inspection and repair of the locomotive. In the past, once the locomotive arrived at the station, the train crew would get off and not be responsible for anything else. Since the implementation of the crew responsibility system, the train crew is responsible for the locomotive's entire condition. Therefore, the learning of the train crews is very important. They stipulate that all train crews must learn to perform Class B and Class C inspections and repairs within a maximum of one and a half years, so that they can both drive and repair. No matter where they are, if the locomotive has a minor problem, they can repair it in a timely manner and not affect the train schedule. Among these three crews, if the first crew is driving, the second crew studies at home. When the locomotive is about to return, the second crew goes to wait for the locomotive and takes care of wiping it down. When the second crew is driving, the third crew prepares for their turn. When conducting Class B and Class C inspections, all train crews participate, learning the methods of inspection and repair. Everyone's work and learning enthusiasm has increased. Not only are the locomotives more meticulously maintained and materials saved, but everyone regards the locomotives as their own valuable property, unwilling to see them break down, and takes good care of them. If there is a small problem, they repair it immediately, so there are fewer problems. This also extends the life of the locomotive. For example, the previous regulation was a major overhaul every six months, which was later changed to a major overhaul every nine months. Now, most locomotives have exceeded the major overhaul time. Due to the implementation of the responsibility system, the locomotives are well maintained, extending their service life.

### 北平机务段实行包乘制　机车寿命延长

　　北平机务段实行包乘制
  　机车寿命延长
    【本报讯】北平机务段自三月二十五日起实行包乘制，当时有二十一台机车，因人不够用，曾按照十八个机车每车两班人配备。从四月十五日起，人已充实起来。改按每台车三班人配备。工作分工，每班人里面有一个司机、一个司炉、一个学习司炉。三班里面共选出一个司机长和一个学习小组长。四月下旬哈尔滨又派来一台哈尔滨号机车，总计已达二十二台。乘务员工作也有了改变：除驾驶行车以外，还要作擦车、注油、点火、落火等工作，同时还要负责机车的检查修理。过去是机车一到站，乘务员一下车就什么都不管了；自实行乘务负责制后，乘务员要负责机车的全部责任。因此乘务员的学习就非常重要。他们规定全体乘务员最多在一年半以内要学会乙、丙检的检查修理，作到能驾能修，不管到什么地方，如机车发生小毛病，能及时修理，不影响行车时间。在这三班人中，如第一班行车，第二班就在家里学习，等到车快回来时，二班去候车，并由二班照顾擦洗。第二班走车，第三班又接上作准备。在进行乙、丙检时，所有乘务员都参加，学习检查与修理的办法。大家的工作和学习情绪都提高了。不但使车精细、用材料节约，而且大家都把机车当成了自己的宝贵财产，不愿他出毛病，照顾的很好。有了小毛病马上修理，这样出毛病就少了，这样也就延长了车的寿命。如过去规定是六个月一大修，以后改成九个月一大修，现在大部分车都已超过了大修的时间，由于实行了包乘制，对机车保养的好，延长了使用的时间。
