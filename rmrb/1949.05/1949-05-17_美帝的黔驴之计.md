The American imperialists have been in control of Japan for four years since Japan's surrender, with MacArthur holding the reins. He has disregarded all suggestions and accusations from the Far Eastern Commission, retaining the organized violent institutions of the Emperor, military personnel, financial cliques, and landlords. He has maintained military industries and bases. Even the minimal democratic rights in the "Constitution" promulgated in 1947 have been stripped away in his support of reactionary factions oppressing the labor movement and crushing the people's freedom. Furthermore, consider the "Informal Provisional Compensation Plan for Japan" drafted by the American investigative representatives under the sole direction of the United States, followed by the "Pauley Reparations Plan," then the "Strikes Reparations Plan," and now the blatant attempt to halt Japanese reparations, further preserving Japan's war potential. All of this demonstrates that in its global expansionist and aggressive plans, the American imperialists are attempting to cultivate Japan as a vanguard against the Soviet Union and the Asian people's democratic movements! This donkey's last trick in Guizhou will be crushed by the surging national liberation movement of the Asian people!

　　美帝的黔驴之计
    日本投降四年来，麦克阿瑟一手把持着管制大权，置远东委员会的一切建议及责难于不顾，保留着天皇军人财阀地主的有组织的暴力机构，保留着军火工业及基地，一九四七年公布的“宪法”上微乎其微的民主权利也在其支持反动派压迫职工运动摧残人民自由的暴行中剥夺无余。再看，从美帝一手制订的美国调查代表所拟的“日本非正式临时赔偿计划”，又继之为“鲍莱氏赔偿计划”，再又继之为“斯特揣克的赔偿计划”，现在又要明目张胆地停止日本赔偿，进一步保留日本作战潜力。这一切均说明了美帝在其世界扩张侵略计划中，正妄图将日本培养为反苏反亚洲人民民主运动的前哨！这种黔驴之计，必将为亚洲人民的汹涌澎湃的民族解放运动所粉碎！
