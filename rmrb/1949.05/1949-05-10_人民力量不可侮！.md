　　The people in the Soviet-occupied zone of East Germany have increasing rations, and their democratic political life is becoming increasingly consolidated. However, in the so-called Allied-occupied zones of West Germany under the control of the United States, Britain, and France, the wages of 100,000 hard-working German people are only equivalent to the cost of a luxurious swimming pool for one American bigwig. The scars of the chains imposed on the people of West Germany by the Nazis have not yet healed, and the burden of the American imperialist "anti-Soviet and anti-people" policy has fallen upon them again. The American imperialist "policy makers" have long placed "West Germany" within "America's European border" and included it in the "North Atlantic Treaty." Naturally, there will be no "sincerity" to enable the German people to enjoy truly peaceful and democratic unification. The achievement of the Four-Power Agreement should be attributed to the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and the great actions of the world's peace-loving people, as well as the impact of the great victory in the Chinese People's Liberation War on the world. As far as the American imperialists are concerned, they should understand from the Berlin problem agreement that the people's power cannot be insulted, and they should take it as a lesson from the failure of their imperialist expansionist policy!

    人民力量不可侮！
    东德苏占领区的人民，配给品在增加，民主政治生活日益巩固，而一线之隔的西德美英法的所谓联占区内，十万个辛勤劳作的德国人民的工资才抵得上一个美国大官的一座华丽的游泳池的花费，纳粹所加于西德人民的锁链伤痕未愈，而美帝的“反苏反人民”政策的重担又落了下来。美帝的“国策制订者”早把“西德”放在“美国的欧洲国界”以内，列入“北大西洋公约”里了，当然不会有什么“诚意”使德国人民能享有真正和平民主的统一，四国协议的获致应归功于苏联的和平政策和世界人民爱好和平的伟大行动，还有中国人民解放战争中巨大胜利给予世界的影响。对美帝来说，它应从柏林问题协议中明白人民力量的不可侮，而且应该把它作为帝国主义扩张政策失败的一个教训！
