Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army liberated Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, on the morning of the 22nd. The defending enemy fled westward. Nanchang is the birthplace of the People's Liberation Army. On August 1, 1927, the Chinese Communist Party launched the Nanchang Uprising here against the Kuomintang reactionaries, creating the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army. Nanchang is the fourth provincial capital liberated by the People's Liberation Army south of the Yangtze River. The other three are Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, Hangzhou in Zhejiang, and Wuchang in Hubei. Nanchang is located in the middle of Jiangxi Province, on the east bank of the Gan River. It is the connecting point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanchang-Xunyang Railways, the center of water and land transportation in Jiangxi Province, with a population of approximately 300,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army, sweeping the Pudong area on the Shanghai front, after liberating Nanhui, Chuansha, and Zhoupu, successively captured many important enemy strongholds from the 18th to the 20th, including Nangao Xing Town, Beigao Xing Town, Jinjiaqiao Town, Donggou Town, Qingningsi, Zhujiaqiao Town, Longwangmiao Town, Beitai Town, Yangsi Town, Qutang Town, Donglingjiazhai, Youjiazhuang, etc. The enemy troops in Pudong have been divided into two parts. The enemy's 12th Army and other units have been compressed into the narrow area north and west of Gaoqiao Town between the Huangpu River and the Yangtze River; another part of the enemy's 37th Army has been compressed into the area west of the line of Tangqiao Town, Xujiazhai, and Beixujiazhai (northeast of Yangjing Town) along the river.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 23rd: The People's Liberation Army, advancing from the western suburbs of Shanghai towards the city, captured the international radio station between Nanxiang and Zhenru stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 12:00 midnight on the 19th, as well as twelve enemy strongholds northwest of it. Some units of the enemy's 52nd Army, 73rd Regiment, and 74th Regiment were annihilated. The remaining enemies fled south. The Liberation Army then took advantage of the victory to capture Gujia Town south of the international radio station.

    【新华社上海前线二十三日电】由上海西部向市郊推进的人民解放军，十九日夜十二时攻占京沪路上南翔与真茹两车站之间的国际无线电台及其西北的十二个敌据点。歼灭守敌五十二军七十三团、七十四团各一部，余敌向南逃窜。解放军又乘胜攻克国际无线电台以南的顾家镇。
