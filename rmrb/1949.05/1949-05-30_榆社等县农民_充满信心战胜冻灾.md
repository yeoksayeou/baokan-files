Taixing Telegram: On the 13th and 14th of this month, the climate suddenly turned cold, and more than ten counties including Heshun and Yushe, which belong to the second and third special districts of Taihang, suffered a serious freezing disaster. More than 70% of wheat, autumn crops, spring vegetables, and fruit trees in the sixth district of Changzhi were killed by frost. The emerged sorghum, corn, hemp, beans, millet, and vegetables in Yu, Wu, Xiang and other places were also mostly frozen to death. After the disaster, the special counties immediately organized forces and dispatched cadres to the disaster areas to lead the masses to destroy and replant. Under the spirit of the party members and cadres highly developing to benefit the people and eliminate malpractices, various places tried to purchase and transfer seeds to lead farmers to replant, and great results have been achieved. After the freezing disaster occurred in Yushe County on the 13th, the county cooperative immediately issued six dan of hemp and sent people to other counties to purchase melon seeds to solve the seed shortage. Under the leadership of branch secretary Zheng Fusheng and others, Sanyu Village in the county cooperated with each other and exchanged seeds and livestock power. In two days, all the frozen seedlings were replanted. Under the full leadership of cadres at all levels in the county, the replanting and sowing work was completed in four days. The cadres of Lucheng went to the countryside to encourage the masses to fight against natural disasters, overcome pessimism and despair, and carry out replanting. They also transferred 60 dan of wheat, autumn barley, and "60-day corn" seeds. Within three days, Gucheng Village, the seventh district of Wuxiang, had almost completed the replanting and destruction of 945 mu of frozen autumn seedlings. A total of 755 mu of beans, 21 mu of hemp, 4 mu of corn, and 67 mu of north and south melons were planted. Now the farmers in the disaster-stricken villages are full of confidence and continue to replant.

    【太行电】本月十三、十四两日，气候突然骤冷，太行二、三专区所属和顺、榆社等十余县，遭受严重冻灾。长治六区百分之七十以上的小麦、秋禾、春菜、果木全被霜死。榆、武、襄等地已出土的高粱、玉茭、大麻、豆、谷、蔬菜，亦多被冻死。灾害发生后各专县立即组织力量，分派干部赴灾区领导群众毁种补种。各地在党员干部高度发挥为民兴利除弊的精神下，设法购种调种，领导农民补种，现已获很大成绩。榆社县十三日发生冻灾后，县联社立即发放大麻六石，并派人到外县购买瓜籽、解决种籽困难。该县杉峪村在支书郑福生等领导下，一面互助起来；一面调换种籽调剂畜力，两天间即将全部冻苗补种完。该县在各级干部全力领导下，四天工夫即全部完成补种下种工作。潞城干部下乡鼓舞群众向天灾作斗争信心、克服悲观失望情绪、进行补种，并给调剂麦子、秋大麦、“六十天玉茭”等种籽六十石。武乡七区故城村三天之内已将冻死的九百四十五亩秋苗补种与毁种将完。计种豆子七百五十五亩，大麻二十一亩，玉茭四亩，南北瓜六十七亩。现各灾村农民充满信心，继续补种。
