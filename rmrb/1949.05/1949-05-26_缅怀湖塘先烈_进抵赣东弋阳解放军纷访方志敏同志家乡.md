Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 24th: People's Liberation Army commanders and soldiers who have reached Qigong Town, Yiyang County, eastern Jiangxi, the hometown of revolutionary martyr Comrade Fang Zhimin, have been visiting and paying respects at the martyr's birthplace in Hutang Village and offering condolences to the local people. Comrade Fang Zhimin was one of the creators of the Chinese Red Army. In two years, he developed from three rifles (one of which was broken) into the Red Army's Tenth Army, which operated across the vast areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. To this day, the people of Jiangxi still circulate the saying: "Fang Zhimin built his world with two and a half guns." In 1934, Comrade Fang Zhimin was ordered to lead the Chinese Red Army's Anti-Japanese Advance Detachment northward to resist Japan. Chiang Kai-shek, who insisted on selling out the country in domestic warfare, used seven times the force to intercept and surround them along the way. Comrade Fang Zhimin was unfortunately captured during a breakout. In July 1935, he was killed by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang. While in prison, Comrade Fang Zhimin suffered the most cruel tortures by the Kuomintang, but he never forgot his vision of creating a "million iron Red Army" and establishing a new China for the people. Now, as the martyr's last wishes are about to be finally realized, the victorious southward-advancing PLA commanders and soldiers have increased their respect and remembrance of the martyr. The villagers of Hutang have all painfully recounted the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries to the PLA. In the past fifteen years, the village has been burned down seven times, but each time the villagers have rebuilt the martyr's hometown with tenacious will. The unit has now sent special personnel to carry consolation money to comfort the martyr's family members and will educate the troops about the martyr's heroic deeds and the arduous struggle of the people in the revolutionary hometown.

    缅怀湖塘先烈
    进抵赣东弋阳解放军纷访方志敏同志家乡
    【新华社浙赣前线二十四日电】进抵革命先烈方志敏同志家乡赣东弋阳县漆工镇的人民解放军指战员，纷纷到烈士的生长地湖塘村瞻仰，并慰问当地人民。方志敏同志是中国红军的创造者之一，曾于二年间从三枝步枪（一枝还是坏的）发展成为纵横闽浙赣广大地区的红军第十军团，至今江西人民还流传着这样的话：“方志敏是靠两枝半枪打天下的。”一九三四年方志敏同志奉命率领中国红军抗日先遣队北上抗日，坚持卖国内战的蒋介石以七倍兵力沿途截击包围，方志敏同志于突围时不幸被俘，一九三五年七月在南昌被蒋介石杀害。在狱中时，方志敏同志曾受尽国民党最残酷的毒刑，但仍念念不忘创造“百万铁的红军”与建立人民的新中国。现在正当先烈遗志行将最后实现的时候，胜利南进的解放军指战员对烈士倍增敬爱与缅怀之情。湖塘村民对解放军都沉痛诉说国民党反动派的罪行，十五年来该村曾被七次烧毁，但每次村民都以顽强的意志把烈士故乡重修起来。现该部已派专人携抚恤金抚恤烈士家属，并将烈士英勇事迹及革命故乡人民的艰苦斗争在部队中进行教育。
