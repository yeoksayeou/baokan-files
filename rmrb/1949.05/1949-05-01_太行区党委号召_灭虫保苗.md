    Taihang District Party Committee Calls for Eliminating Pests to Protect Seedlings
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] The counties along the Pinghan Railway in the Taihang District, especially some semi-old areas, are experiencing a resurgence of locusts this spring due to the incomplete elimination of locusts last year. More than 100 villages in Anyang County have discovered locust nymphs. The most serious case is Matoujian Village, where a 60-mu (approx. 10 acres) area has a density of 15 to 30 nymphs per square foot. In the 3rd and 4th districts of Tangyin County, locust nymphs have emerged in more than 20 villages. In Shuiyu Village, Cixian County, the area affected by small flying locusts is two li (approx. 0.6 miles) wide and one li long. Locust nymphs have also been found in most villages in Lin County. Meanwhile, in the vicinity of Xingtai and Neiqiu County, insects that eat wheat and rapeseed have been discovered. In Wu'an, many villages also have flea beetles eating vegetables. In response to the above situation, the District Party Committee has urgently called on all counties to eliminate pests and protect seedlings. The initial experience of Anyang in fighting locusts is to educate the masses to break their paralysis and worries, and to make them aware of the harm caused by the development of locusts. Mobilize all men, women, young, and old to take organized action, establish a locust eradication and pest control headquarters, and select scouts to report on the pest situation to the headquarters every day, so as to carry out planned capture and elimination. Reward and commend activists in locust eradication and pest control, and organize the masses to carry out competitions.
    [Jinzhong Telegram] According to a report from the Jiexiu County government, a large number of pests have been found damaging wheat seedlings in Xiaogejian, Nanqiaotou, which borders Xiaoyi County, and in Beiqiaotou and Chengjiazhuang, which belong to Xiaoyi. It is said that this kind of pest is a newly hatched larva from locust eggs. The larvae are shaped like fleas, are the color of soil, and hide in the morning and evening. They appear as soon as the sun comes out and bite the stems or leaves of wheat seedlings. The local people are extremely uneasy. After learning the news, the Jiexiu County government immediately notified the Xiaoyi County government and quickly reported to higher authorities. The Taiyuan Municipal Government dispatched a team of three on the 16th, including Li Wenhua, director of the Taigu Agricultural Experiment Station, carrying locust control sprayers and various insecticides to cooperate with the local people in capturing and killing the pests.

    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] Gray-green and yellowish-white small worms, shaped like silkworms, have been found in Zhongshengban Village, Fifth District, Zhengding County, which specialize in biting wheat leaves. White worms that specialize in biting wheat hearts have also been found in Xizhaotong Village, Sixth District. After discovering this, district cadres have begun to organize capture efforts. The county production committee put forward the slogan "Where pests are found, eliminate them there," and will never allow them to spread. (Yao Fu)

    太行区党委号召
    灭虫保苗
    【本报讯】太行区沿平汉线各县，特别是一些半老区，因去年蝗虫未彻底消灭，今春又复滋生。安阳县一百余村发现蝗蝻，最严重者如马头涧村，有六十亩大的一片地，密度每方尺有十五个至三十个之多。汤阴县三、四区有二十余村蝗蝻出土。磁县水峪村小飞蝗有二里宽一里长。林县大部村庄也发现蝗蝻，同时邢台附近和内邱县一带发现吃麦及吃油菜的虫。武安亦有不少村有猿叶虫吃小菜。该区区党委根据以上情况紧急号召各县灭虫保苗。安阳打蝗初步经验是教育群众打破其麻痹和顾虑，使群众认识蝗虫发展下去的危害。男女老少齐动员，有组织的行动起来，成立剿蝗灭虫指挥部，并选出侦察员，每日侦察虫情向指挥部做报告，以便有计划的进行捕灭。奖励表扬剿蝗灭虫中的积极分子，组织群众开展竞赛。
    【晋中电】据介休县政府报导，该县与孝义交界之小圪坫、南桥头及孝义属之北桥头、程家庄一带近日发现大量害虫损害麦苗。据说此种害虫系刚由蝗卵孵出之幼虫形状小如跳蚤，颜色似土，早晚潜伏，太阳一出即出现，咬食麦苗的茎或叶，当地群众极不安心，介休县政府得息后，一面通知孝义县政府，一面速向上级报告，太原市政府已于十六日派太谷农业试验场主任李文华等一行三人，携带灭蝗喷雾器及杀虫药品多种，协同当地群众进行捕杀害虫。    （马明）
    【本报讯】正定县五区中圣板村发现如蚕形灰绿色、黄白色小虫，专咬麦叶，六区西兆通村亦有小白虫专咬麦心。区干部发觉后已开始组织捕捉。县生产委员会提出“哪里发现害虫，哪里扑灭”口号，绝不让它蔓延。    （药夫）
