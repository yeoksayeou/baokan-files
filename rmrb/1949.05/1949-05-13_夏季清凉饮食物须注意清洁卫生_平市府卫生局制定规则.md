	Summer Refreshments Must Be Clean and Sanitary
	Peiping Municipal Government Health Bureau Formulates Rules

	[Report from this newspaper] As the weather gets warmer, attention should be paid to the hygiene of summer refreshments. To this end, the Peiping Municipal People's Government Health Bureau has specifically stipulated "Rules for the Management of Hygiene in Refreshment Businesses," and notified the people's governments of all districts to mobilize the broad masses of citizens to cooperate in their implementation. All refreshment businesses, whether shops or vendors, must submit a detailed application to the bureau to obtain a permit before applying to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce for a business license. It is also stipulated that the location of manufacturing and selling places should not be close to toilets, garbage dumps, or other dirty places; they should have dust-proof and fly-proof equipment, and install screens on windows and doors. The raw materials used in the manufacture of refreshments must be clean and fresh, and the water and easily contaminated raw materials must be boiled. Adulteration or the use of toxic pigments and flavorings is prohibited. Utensils such as bags, boxes, baskets, crates, and cabinets must be clean. Employees and vendors suffering from venereal disease, tuberculosis, or infectious skin diseases are not allowed to practice. Those who develop these diseases after starting business should stop working and may only resume work after recovery. In order to protect the health and safety of the general public, the bureau will not only test samples before business operations begin, but also periodically test mass-produced and originally packaged wholesale items. The rules also stipulate that those who repeatedly violate the rules and refuse to correct their behavior, and whose circumstances are serious, will be subject to a suspension of business for a period of one month or less.
