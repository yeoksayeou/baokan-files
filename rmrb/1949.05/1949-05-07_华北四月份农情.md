North China Agricultural Conditions in April

    Concluding the spring plowing, intensifying wheat cultivation, and carrying out the sowing of cotton, peanuts, and other special crops were the central agricultural activities in the North China region in April. In the first half of April, leadership organs at all levels, in coordination with this situation, universally organized inspection teams to go deep into the villages to inspect the implementation of production plans and extensively promote the sowing of special crops. From the reports from various places in mid-April, this work achieved good results. After publicity and inspection work in Yuanchao County, Jinnan, the number of acres of cotton planted by farmers in the entire county exceeded the original plan by 70,000 mu. In Ningnan, it exceeded the original plan by one time. The areas that underwent inspection universally promoted and brought into play the core role of the branches in production leadership, thereby strengthening the Party's leadership over production work. All regions quite universally launched wheat cultivation movements. According to statistics from twenty counties in Taihang, Jinnan, and Jizhong, wheat fields have been cultivated once universally. Fanxian, Qingfeng, Nanle, and other counties in Jiluyu, which have never had the habit of cultivating wheat, also quite universally organized wheat cultivation and watering work this year. In Qingfeng Chengguan District, 15 percent of wheat fields were cultivated more than twice. The results of wheat cultivation are beneficial in preventing pests, protecting wheat roots, and increasing wheat yields. In addition, in Jinnan, Taihang, Jidong, Jizhong, and other areas that suffered floods last year, the sowing of early-maturing crops was organized. According to incomplete statistics from the above four regions, more than 500,000 mu of early-maturing crops were sown. Many counties in Chahar Province organized the sowing of spring wheat. Peas, broad beans, hemp, hemp seeds, and other crops were also sown entirely around the Grain Rain solar term.

    In the last ten days of April, most areas in North China experienced drought. As of the end of April, the areas that had rainfall were the entire Jiluyu region. In Jinnan, only Jingxian, Handan, Cheng'an, and four other counties had rainfall. In Taihang, the second, third, and fifth special districts received two to three zhi of rainfall. In Jidong, the twelfth special district, Jining, Qian'an, and nine other counties had thorough rainfall in early April. In areas that had rainfall, the leading organs seized the opportunity to organize farmers to sow. In Qian'an County, more than 80,000 mu have been sown in over 200 villages. In order to strive for the timely sowing of special crops without violating the farming season, Jinnan and Jizhong organized well digging, water carrying, spot sowing, and the organization of canals and well irrigation. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-eight counties in Jizhong, more than 1,000 earthen wells and 388 brick wells have been dug, which can guarantee the timely sowing of more than 100,000 mu of land. Ningnan County in Jinnan used the Fuyang and Fenhe rivers to organize farmers to irrigate and, in order to prevent disputes, each village organized an irrigation committee, which irrigated more than 16,000 mu of land in half a month, and 90 percent has now been sown. Farmers in more than ten counties, including Weixian, Yongzhi, and Qiuxian, have begun to organize mutual aid to carry out spot sowing. Due to the impact of the drought, pest outbreaks occurred in various counties along the Pinghan Railway in the Taihang area, including Cixian, Anyang, Tangyin, Linxian, Neiqiu, and Xingtai counties. In Jizhong, these included Ningjin, Gaocheng, Qingyuan, Anping, Renqiu and other counties. In Jinnan, these included Nanhe, Julu, Longyao and other counties. The most harmful are the fire spider (which eats wheat seedlings), the elm leaf beetle (which eats oil leaves), and locust nymphs in some areas. However, due to the timely organization of forces by leadership organs at all levels to control and eliminate pests, the areas where pests are spreading are not large. The elm leaf beetles found in seventeen villages in the second district of Neiqiu were eliminated within three or four days. The fire spiders that occurred in thirty-two villages in Gaocheng were completely eliminated within half a month in conjunction with wheat watering.

    Now that Start of Summer has arrived and Grain Full is approaching, all special economic crops and grains must be sown during this period. However, most areas in the region have not had rainfall. If we do not make every effort to organize spot sowing and irrigation, it will seriously affect the completion of the sowing task. The North China Government issued an emergency notice on drought-resistant sowing on April 28, calling on all men and women laborers in the region to organize together, use all available water conservancy conditions, and carry out spot sowing. The Jinnan District Party Committee convened a joint conference of district secretaries to specifically discuss how to seize the opportunity to carry out cotton planting. The meeting decided that the party, government, army, and people of the entire district should immediately mobilize to lead the masses to spot plant and rush plant, creating a drought planting upsurge, proposing not to wait for rain and not to rely on the sky, to deep sow where possible, to spot plant where possible, and strive to complete the task without rain. It should be considered that these measures are very important at present.

    华北四月份农情
    结束春耕，加紧锄麦，进行棉花、花生等特种作物播种，为华北区四月份农事活动中心。四月前半月各级领导机关，配合这一情况，普遍组织了检查组，深入到村，以检查生产计划的执行情形，并深入宣传推广特种作物的播种。从四月中旬各地的报导情形看，这一工作曾获得了较好的成效。冀南元朝县经宣传与检查工作后，全县农民计种棉花亩数超过原计划七万亩。宁南则超过原计划一倍。经过检查的地区，都普遍地推动与发挥了支部在生产领导中核心作用，从而加强了党对生产工作的领导。各区均相当普遍地发动了锄麦运动，太行、冀南、冀中，二十个县的统计，麦田已普锄一遍，冀鲁豫范县、清丰、南乐、县等县，向来无锄麦习惯，今年也相当普遍地组织了锄麦与浇麦工作，清丰城关区锄麦两遍以上者即达麦地百分之十五，锄麦的结果，对于防除害虫与保护麦根增加麦田产量上说，均有好处。此外，在冀南、太行、冀东、冀中等去年遭受水灾地区，均组织了早种作物的播种，据以上四个地区的不完全统计，共播种之早熟作物为五十万余亩，察哈尔省不少县份，组织了春麦播种。碗豆、扁豆、麻、大麻子等作物亦在谷雨节前后全部下种。
    四月下旬，华北多数地区，均呈旱象。截至四月底止，已下雨的地区为冀鲁豫全区、冀南则仅有景县、邯郸、成安等四县落雨，太行二、三、五专区下雨二、三指，冀东十二专区集宁、迁安等九县于四月初落透雨。落雨地区，领导机关，都抓紧时机，组织农民下种。迁安全县二百余村庄已播种者即有八万亩。为争取特种作物的不违农时及时下种，冀南冀中均组织了挖井、担水、点种及组织水渠水井浇种等工作。据冀中二十八个县的不完全统计，已挖成土井一千余眼，砖井三百八十八眼，可保证十多万亩土地，及时下种。冀南宁南县利用滏阳、沣河水，组织农民浇种，并为防止先后纠纷，各村组织浇地委员会，半月时间浇地一万六千余亩，现百分之九十已经播种。威县、永智、邱县等十余县农民，均已开始组织互助突击点种。由于天旱影响，虫灾所发生的地区，有太行区平汉沿线各县份，包括磁县、安阳、汤阴、林县、内邱、邢台等县。冀中包括宁晋、藁城、清苑、安平、任邱等县。冀南包括南和、巨鹿、隆尧等县。为害最大的是火蛛子（吃麦苗），与猿叶虫（吃油叶），及部分地区的蝗蝻。但由于各级领导机关，均能及时组织力量，抓紧扑灭，因此目前虫害蔓延的地区并不算大。内邱二区十七个村所发现的猿叶虫在三、四天内即行扑灭。藁城三十二村在半月内结合浇麦将所发生的火蛛子全数扑灭。
    现立夏已到，小满即至，在此期间，一切特种经济作物及谷物均须于此时期内完成播种。但目前全区多数地区未落雨，如不全力组织点种浇种，将十分影响播种任务的完成。华北政府已于四月二十八日发出抗旱播种的紧急通知，号召全区男女劳力一齐组织起来，利用尽可能利用一切水利条件，进行点种。冀南区党委召集了地书联席会议，专门讨论如何抓紧时机，突击种棉的问题，会议决定全区党政军民立即动员起来，领导群众点种抢种造成旱种热潮，提出不等雨不靠天，能深耩的深耩，能点种的点种，争取不下雨完成任务。应该认为这些措施，在当前均是十分重要的。
