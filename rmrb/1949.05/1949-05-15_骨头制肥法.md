    How to make fertilizer from bones?
    Xi Lijiapozi, PingShan County

    Method for making coarse bone meal: Smash the bones and put them in a large pot with water to boil. After the water boils for two or three hours, remove the oil and some of the gelatinous substances from the surface of the water. After it dries and solidifies, grind it into bone meal. Method for making degelatinized bone meal: Put the bones in a pot with water and cook them at a low temperature for a long time to remove most of the oil and gelatinous substances, then grind them. Bone meal contains more phosphorus and potassium, so it needs to be mixed with other fertilizers before application. Bone meal is a slow-release fertilizer and is suitable for use as a base fertilizer. If used as a top dressing, it must be fermented first—soaked in water to form black mud. If used as green manure, about sixty catties per mu is sufficient.

    骨头制肥法编者同志：
    骨头如何制肥？
    平山县西李家坡子一
    粗骨粉制法：将骨头砸碎放在大锅里用水煮，等到水开至两三点钟以后，再在水面除去油和胶质的一部分，干结后研碎成骨粉；脱胶骨粉的制法：将骨放锅内加水，经低温的长期熬煮，除去油和胶质的大部分，研碎即成。骨粉含怜钾较多，故需与其它肥料混合施用。骨粉是迟效肥料，宜作底粪，如用作追肥时须先使发酵—加水沤成黑泥—。若抓青，每亩地上六十斤左右就够了。
