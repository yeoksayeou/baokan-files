Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 30th: The China Democratic League recently issued the following "May Day" message:

The glorious festival of the working class around the world - "May Day" - is descending upon us today with a new posture and a new significance. This new posture is manifested in the fact that the working class today, whether in the world or in various countries, holds the leading position in safeguarding people's democracy and lasting peace. The new significance of this year's "May Day" lies in the fact that this year's "May Day" grand review of the world's working class is not only a review of the working class's own ranks, but more importantly, it is a general review of the people of all strata around the world who demand peace and democracy, led by it, and a general review of the democratic and peace camp. For China, in this year's "May Day," we especially want to enthusiastically celebrate the victory of the liberation of the Chinese people under the leadership of the working class. The victory of the united front of the Chinese democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

Based on its consistent position and firm struggle to strive for people's democracy and true peace, the China Democratic League wishes to take this opportunity of the "May Day" festival to extend its congratulations to the great friendly party - the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mr. Mao Zedong, who have unyieldingly led the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country to the path of liberation and victory, and at the same time extend its warm respect to the working class who led the Chinese people's revolution. Finally, we also hope that workers across the country will, under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, redouble their efforts to develop production in order to support the front lines and build the rear, in commemoration of this great "May Day"!

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 30th: The China People's Salvation Association recently issued the following May Day message: (On the May Day of 1949, the facts before us are: the tide of peace and democracy around the world is unprecedentedly high, and the world's people's camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong; in China, the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army has liberated large cities in North China and Central China, and the joint rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China has been basically defeated!

May Day 1949 heralds: a bright new era, a true people's century, is at hand, and the rule of all dark reactionary forces will soon come to an end fundamentally.

On this great victorious May Day, the China People's Salvation Association calls on all Chinese youth, intellectuals, freelancers, university professors, public school teachers, shop assistants, office workers, and cultural workers to unite with workers and peasants, intensify unity, intensify learning, temper themselves, transform themselves, combine theory with reality, combine mental labor with physical labor, combine rural areas with cities, and follow the path indicated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong to carry the revolution through to the end. In the near future, in particular, we must unite and fight to increase production, support the front lines, and to convene a new political consultative conference, establish a democratic coalition government, and build the People's Republic of China!

Let us shout: Workers of the world, unite! All democratic forces in China, unite! Long live world peace and democracy! Long live the People's Republic of China!

    【新华社北平三十日电】中国民主同盟顷发表“五一”祝辞如下：
    全世界工人阶级的光荣节日——“五一”节，今天正以新的姿态，新的意义，降临在我们面前了。这新姿态就表现在今天工人阶级不论在世界上或在各国内，都荣居于保卫人民民主与持久和平的领导地位。今年“五一”节的新意义，则在今年世界工人阶级的“五一”大检阅，不光是工人阶级本身队伍的检阅，而重要的是以它为主导的全世界要求和平民主的各阶层人民大众的总检阅，是民主与和平阵营的总检阅。对于我们中国来说，在今年的“五一”节，我们尤其要狂热地庆祝工人阶级领导下的中国人民大众获得解放的胜利。全中国民主革命统一战线反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的胜利。
    中国民主同盟根据自己所一贯主张与坚决奋斗以争取的人民民主和真正和平的立场与方针，对于不屈不挠领导中国工人阶级和全国人民走上解放胜利之途的伟大友党——中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东先生，愿借此“五一”佳节的机会，向它致领导革命成功的贺忱，同时并向领导中国人民革命的工人阶级致热烈的敬意。最后，我们还希望全国工人们要在公私兼顾，劳资两利的原则之下，为支援前线，建设后方而加倍努力地发展生产，以纪念这伟大的“五一”节！
    【新华社北平三十日电】中国人民救国会顷发表五一劳动节献辞如下： (  在一九四九年的五一节，摆在眼前的事实是：全世界和平民主的浪潮空前地高涨，以苏联为首的全世界人民阵营空前地强大；在中国国内，人民解放军的胜利进军，使华北华中大城市，大部分得到解放，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的联合统治，已经被基本上打垮！
    一九四九年五一节预告着：一个光明的新时代，真正的人民世纪，就在面前，一切黑暗的反动势力的统治时期，不久就要根本结束。
    在这伟大的胜利的五一节，中国人民救国会号召全中国的青年、知识分子、自由职业者、大学教授、公教人员、店员、职员、文化工作者，要和工人和农民打成一片，加紧团结，加紧学习，锻炼自己，改造自己，让理论与现实结合起来，脑力劳动与体力劳动结合起来，农村与城市结合起来，依照中国共产党和毛泽东主席所指示的道路，使革命进行到底。在最近时期，尤其要为了增加生产，支援前线，并为了召开新的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，建设中华人民民主共和国而团结奋斗！
    让我们高呼：全世界劳动人民团结起来！全中国民主力量团结起来！全世界和平民主万岁！中华人民民主共和国万岁！
