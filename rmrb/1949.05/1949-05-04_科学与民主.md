    "Science and Democracy"
    Zhou Jianren

    We commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement today with particularly joyful feelings because Beiping, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, has been liberated, and the people oppressed by feudal remnants, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism have been emancipated. Moreover, recently, Nanjing, the ruling center of the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, has also been liberated, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been declared defunct. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people have become an incomparably powerful force. Although British and American imperialism attempt to obstruct it, it is no different from "a mantis trying to stop a chariot," and will only invite shameful failure. The Chinese people have now embarked on the path of true humanity, and it will not be long before they reach the realm of true humanity through hard work. Furthermore, during the May Fourth Movement, "science and democracy" were proposed. Today, the science we understand is no longer the descriptive concept of "science for science's sake," let alone serving the interests of a few or the war merchants. It goes without saying that it is to serve the people, and further to serve the interests and happiness of mankind. The so-called democracy does not refer to the "democracy" where a few people have political rights and individual freedom, but rather the people's democracy with democratic centralism, which is true democracy. Therefore, we commemorate this "May Fourth" with particularly joyful feelings, and everyone must be very happy and excited.

    “科学与民主”
    周建人
    我们今日以特别高兴的心情来纪念三十周年的“五四”纪念日，因为五四运动的发源地的北平已经获得解放，在封建残余、官僚资本主义，及帝国主义压迫下的人民已经翻了身。而且最近以蒋匪为首的国民党反动派的统治中心地区的南京也已解放了，国民党反动统治已宣告灭亡。中国人民的革命力量在共产党与毛主席正确领导之下成为强大无比的力量，英美帝国主义虽企图阻挠，无异“螳腿挡车”，无非招受可耻的失败罢了。中国人民现在已走上了真正人类的道路，努力前进，达到真正人类的境地是不会遥远的。还有，五四运动的时候，曾提出“科学与民主”，今日我们所了解的科学已不是“为科学而科学”的描象概念，更不是为少数人的利益及为战争贩子效劳，这是不必多言的，而是为人民服务，并进而为人类的利益与幸福服务。所谓民主，也不是指少数人有政治权利与个人自由的“民主”，却是民主集中制的人民民主，这是真正的民主。因此我们以特别高兴的心情来纪念这“五四”，大家必定非常欢欣鼓舞。
