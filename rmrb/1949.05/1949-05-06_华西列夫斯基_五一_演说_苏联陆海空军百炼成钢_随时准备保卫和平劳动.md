    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 4th: Moscow dispatch: Marshal of the Soviet Union A.M. Vasilevsky, Minister of the Armed Forces of the USSR, delivered a speech at the May Day parade in Moscow, extending greetings on behalf of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to the Soviet Armed Forces and the Soviet working people. Vasilevsky said: The Soviet people express their love for the motherland and their highest loyalty to the cause of Lenin and Stalin through their victories on the labor front and their armed forces through their achievements in military training. The material and cultural well-being of the working people is steadily increasing, which proves the superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system. In contrast, unemployment is increasing in capitalist countries, the exploiters' attacks on the living standards of the working people are intensifying, and the plight and lack of rights of workers and peasants are becoming more severe due to the American reactionaries' preparations for a new world war. Vasilevsky pointed out: The American ruling clique has embarked on a path of aggression, hastily organizing military blocs with force, concluding the North Atlantic Treaty, and directing the spearhead of their aggressive policy at the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. He called on: To counter these conspiracies of the warmongers, the people of all countries around the world must consolidate their strength under the banner of world peace. Vasilevsky finally pointed out: Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people are confidently striving to solve the great task of building communism and are marching towards the victory of communism. The Soviet people must wage an unyielding struggle to achieve a comprehensive increase in labor productivity, strive for the utmost perfection in product quality, strive for the strictest economy and reduction of production costs, implement Stalin's plan to transform nature, and strive for a bumper harvest to further improve the material and cultural level of the working people. The Soviet army reliably defends the socialist motherland. The Soviet working people can rest assured that the Soviet Army, Navy, and Air Force have been tempered in battle and are ready at any time to gloriously fulfill their sacred duty of defending the peaceful labor of the Soviet people.

    华西列夫斯基“五一”演说
    苏联陆海空军百炼成钢
    随时准备保卫和平劳动
    【新华社北平四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联武装部队部部长、苏联元帅华西列夫斯基在“五一”节莫斯科阅兵典礼上发表演说，代表苏联政府与联共中央向苏联武装部队与苏联劳动人民致敬。华西列夫斯基说：苏维埃人民以他们在劳动战线上的胜利，而他们的武装部队则以军事训练上的成就，来表示他们对祖国的热爱和对列宁、斯大林党的事业的最高忠诚。劳动人民的物质和文化的幸福正在稳步增进，这一次证明了苏维埃社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。反观资本主义各国失业正在增加，剥削者对劳动人民生活水平的进攻正在日益加强，工人和农民的困苦和缺乏权利正因美国反动分子准备发动新的世界大战而更加严重。华西列夫斯基指出：美国统治集团已走上侵略政策的道路，用强力匆匆忙忙地组织军事集团，缔结北大西洋公约，并已把侵略政策的矛头指向苏联与人民民主国家。他号召：为了回答战争贩子的这些阴谋，全世界各国人民务须在为世界和平而高举的旗帜下，巩固他们的力量。华西列夫斯基最后指出：苏联人民正在列宁斯大林的旗帜下，满怀信心地努力解决建设共产主义的伟大任务，向共产主义的胜利迈进。苏联人民必须进行不屈不挠的斗争，以争取劳动生产率的全面提高，争取产品质量的尽善尽美，争取最严格的节省与生产成本的减低，实现斯大林的改造自然计划，争取丰收，以进一步提高劳动人民的物质与文化水平。苏维埃军队可靠地保卫着社会主义祖国。苏联劳动人民可以放心，苏联陆空海军已在战斗中百炼成钢，他们随时准备光荣地完成他们的神圣职责，保卫苏联人民的和平劳动。
