Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 11th – Accepting orders from state-owned enterprises and improving internal labor-management relations are important factors for the recovery and development of private enterprises. The Cixing Iron Factory, a private enterprise in Beiping, is a prominent example. At the beginning of Beiping's liberation, almost all of the factory's machines were at a standstill. The factory manager, Song Huaru, said, "At that time, we did not understand how to implement the principle of 'both public and private interests, both labor and management benefit,' so we had doubts and fears. At the same time, because we did not understand the situation in various places, we dared not blindly produce, so we had to stop." In February, the factory manufactured more than three tons of custom goods for the People's Printing Factory, and the capitalists obtained considerable profits in addition to the workers' wages. At the same time, the factory saw the policies promulgated by the People's Government and the actual situation of private factories, gradually dispelling doubts and fears, and continued to manufacture machine parts for several factories. In April, the factory manufactured one hundred sets of water pipes for the Water Conservancy Society of the Chahar Provincial People's Government and gained a portion of profit. Later, seeing that the relationship between urban and rural areas was gradually opening up, and coupled with the drought, the factory realized that producing products to supply rural needs had great prospects for development, so it actively prepared to restore the foundry (ie, the casting department), which had been shut down for more than two years, and the four-ton iron melting furnace, and prepared to hire more workers. Recently, the factory signed a contract with the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society to manufacture seventy tons of pig iron waterwheels (equivalent to more than 300 vehicles), so it actively repaired machinery and tools and began to expand production.

In the process of gradually restoring production, the labor-management relations in the factory have also improved somewhat compared with before liberation. Before liberation, the highest wage for workers was three catties of millet per day. After liberation, through consultation between labor and management, wages were adjusted to three grades: the highest was twelve catties per day, the second grade was calculated at 90%, and the third grade was calculated at 80%. At the same time, workers also won one day off every two weeks, which improved their production enthusiasm. For example, when the factory manufactured custom goods for the People's Printing Factory, the factory stipulated that the daily output should be 300 pieces. If one more piece was produced, the wage would be increased by one yuan and five jiao. As a result, the daily output reached 1,500 pieces. Another example is the manufacture of paper cutter frames for the People's Paper Mill, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 28 days but was delivered eight days ahead of schedule. Worker Zhao Xingnan said, "Our workers must work hard to develop production for the construction of the new China. After we studied Comrade Li Lisan's paper 'Several Explanations on the Policy of Developing Production for the Benefit of Both Labor and Management,' we understood how workers should do correctly today."

    接受公营企业定货
    改进内部劳资关系
    北平私营慈型铁工厂生产发展
    【新华社北平十一日电】接受公营企业的定货，并改进内部的劳资关系，是私营企业恢复与发展生产的重要因素。北平市私营慈型铁工厂，是一个显著的例子。北平解放之初，该厂机器几乎全部停顿。该厂经理宋化如说：“那时我们不懂公私兼顾，劳资两利是怎样施行，因此存着怀疑和畏惧；同时因不了解各地情况，不敢盲目生产，只好停顿着。”二月中，该厂为人民印制厂制造三吨多定货，除去工人工资外，资方得到了相当利润。同时该厂看到人民政府颁布的政策和对私营工厂的实际情形，渐渐地打消疑惧，即继续为几个工厂制造了机器零件。四月中该厂曾为察哈尔省人民政府水利社制造定货水管子一百套，又得到一部分利润。后来又看到城乡关系逐渐打开，加以天旱不雨，该厂体会到生产供给农村需要的产品有很大的发展前途，乃积极地筹备恢复已经停顿二年多的翻砂厂（即铸工部）和容量四吨多的熔铁炉，并准备增雇工人。最近该厂又和华北水利推进社签订了制造七十吨生铁的水车（约合三百余辆）的合同，于是便积极修理机器工具，开始扩大生产。
    在逐步恢复生产过程中，该厂的劳资关系较解放前亦有一些改进。解放前工人最高工资是日薪三斤小米，解放后经劳资双方协议，工资调整为三等，最高每日十二斤，二等按九折，三等按八折计算；同时工人也争取到每两周休假一日，因之生产情绪提高。如该厂为人民印制厂制造定货时，厂方规定每天产量为三百件，如多产一件，就增加工资一元五角，结果日产量竟达一千五百件。又如为人民造纸厂造切纸刀架子时，原定二十八天完成，结果提早八天交货。工人赵星南说：“咱们工人为了建设新中国，要努力发展生产，我们学习了李立三同志的论文‘关于发展生产劳资两利政策的几点说明’后，明白了工人今天怎样做才是正确的。”
