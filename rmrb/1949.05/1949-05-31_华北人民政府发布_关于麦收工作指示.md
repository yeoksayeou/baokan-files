　　North China People's Government Issues
    Instructions on Wheat Harvesting Work

    [This newspaper dispatch] The North China People's Government, with the wheat harvesting season arriving in this region, issued the Agricultural General Letter No. 6 on May 28 regarding instructions for wheat harvesting work. It calls on governments at all levels to closely organize the protection and harvesting of wheat, prevent sabotage activities by bandits and special agents, assist the masses in selecting superior wheat varieties, and conduct detailed investigations of harvest conditions to grasp this year's wheat requisition work, with the aim of fair burden. The original text of the instructions is as follows (these instructions will not be issued separately):

    With the wheat harvesting season approaching, the following points are specifically emphasized to ensure the smooth completion of wheat harvesting in all areas:

    1. This year's wheat harvest is being carried out under the circumstances of the complete liberation of North China and the hope of national victory. The broad masses of cadres and people are easily prone to complacency due to victory, and neglect the security work of wheat harvesting. We must especially raise vigilance and strictly prevent sabotage activities by bandits and special agents, as well as harassment by scattered soldiers. Governments at all levels should cooperate with local armed forces and militia to mobilize the masses, help each other, organize the protection and harvesting of wheat, and ensure quick harvesting and storage. Special attention should be paid to areas in newly liberated areas where bandit and secret society activities are more prevalent.

    2. During the wheat harvest, the masses should be widely mobilized to carry out seed selection work. Technical personnel from agricultural departments and farms at all levels should immediately go to the countryside, conduct extensive and organized propaganda on seed selection for the masses, and specifically organize the masses to select superior varieties that have high yields, are resistant to disease and wind, and are most preferred by them, in order to prepare superior wheat seeds for the coming autumn.

    3. "Planting one day earlier ripens ten days earlier." In areas where there is a tradition of continuous planting and original planting for two seasons after the wheat harvest, sowing should be organized immediately to prevent delayed sowing due to drought or continuous rain. In areas where more wheat was planted last year, the difficulties of the masses in sowing after the wheat harvest should be sufficiently estimated, and practical assistance should be provided promptly. Furthermore, because this region experienced a relatively dry spring and late sowing, the wheat harvest in some areas must be carried out simultaneously with the sowing and weeding of autumn crops. Therefore, the organization and adjustment of labor and animal power, and the extensive mobilization of semi-labor and auxiliary labor, are even more important.

    4. Due to natural disasters or enemy destruction, some areas experienced spring famine this spring. Although the wheat fields this year are generally more extensive than in previous years, they have been experiencing a poor harvest due to less winter snow and severe spring drought. Therefore, when arranging the wheat requisition this year, it is necessary to conduct preliminary investigations to accurately understand the harvest situation, grasp the balance of burdens in various areas, and reasonably allocate requisition tasks under the principle of not affecting people's lives and reinvestment in production. For areas severely affected by disasters, after sending personnel to investigate, specific suggestions for reducing requisitions should be submitted to the government for approval. It is hoped that during the wheat requisition process, attention will be paid to mobilizing savings for disaster preparedness and avoiding waste. Trade and cooperative departments should also systematically adjust the supply of coarse grains to disaster areas to assist the masses in overcoming difficulties.

### 华北人民政府发布  关于麦收工作指示

　　华北人民政府发布
    关于麦收工作指示
    【本报讯】华北人民政府以本区麦收时间已经到来，于五月二十八日发出农总字第六号关于麦收工作的指示，号召各级政府严密组织护麦收麦，防止匪特破坏活动，协助群众选择优良麦种，并细密调查收成情况，掌握今年征麦工作，以期公平负担，指示原文如下（此指示不另行文）：
    收麦季节已届，为保证各地麦收顺利完成，特提示以下几点：
    一、今年麦收是在华北完全解放，全国胜利在望的形势下进行的，广大干部与群众很容易因胜利而麻痹，忽视麦收的保卫工作，必须特别提出警惕，严防匪特的破坏活动及散兵游勇的骚扰。各级政府应协同地方武装及民兵，发动群众，守望相助，组织护麦收麦，快打快藏，在新解放区之匪特会门活动较多地区更应特别注意。
    二、在麦收当中，应广泛动员群众，进行选种工作，各级农业部门和农场的技术人员，应立即下乡，有组织有计划的对群众进行选种的广泛宣传，具体组织群众选择产量大及抗病、抗风力强而又为他们所最喜欢的优良品种，为今秋准备下优良麦种。
    三、“早种一日早熟十天”，麦收后可能连种及原有种两季习惯的地区，应立即组织播种，以防天旱或连雨而耽误播种时节。在去年种麦较多地区，应足够估计群众在麦收后播种上的困难，即时予以切实帮助。更因本区今春较旱，下种较晚，若干地区之麦收与大秋作物之播种锄苗等工作须同时进行，因此劳畜力的组织调剂和半劳力辅助劳力的广泛动员就更加重要。
    四、由于天灾或敌祸，今春曾有部分地区发生春荒，今年麦田虽一般较往年为多，但因冬雪少而春旱又严重，已呈歉收，因此在今年布置麦征时，必须预作调查，切实地了解收成情况，掌握各地负担之平衡，在不影响人民生活与再生产投资的原则下，合理分配征收任务。对受灾严重地区应于派员勘查后，具体提出减征意见，报本府核定。并希在征麦过程中，注意动员节约备荒，避免浪费。贸易合作部门并应有计划地向灾区调剂杂粮，以协助群众克服困难。
