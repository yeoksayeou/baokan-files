Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 23rd -- The Wuxi Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee held a meeting of all committee members and work team members on May 16th to discuss how to restore and develop urban production, especially how to first solve the current problems of resumption of work and employment. After the liberation of Wuxi, most of the larger public and private factories have successively started or resumed work, and some factories that have not started work are also actively preparing to resume work. Workers at the state-owned Wuxi Agricultural Implements Factory are preparing to complete the two engines that were unfinished before liberation, along with the May tasks. Workers at the privately-owned Zhenxin Yarn Factory have maintained a certain level of production efficiency despite constant harassment by enemy aircraft. However, on the other hand, some private factories have not actively overcome certain difficulties such as raw materials, fuel, and sales channels because they do not fully understand the industrial and commercial policies and labor policies of the People's Government. They have adopted a passive wait-and-see attitude towards restoring and developing production. Based on the above situation, after discussion at the meeting, it was decided that the central task of all workers in Wuxi City is to expand publicity and education, unite other democratic classes, and work together to restore and develop production, first of all to solve the current problems of resumption of work and employment, and thereby gradually establish trade unions in accordance with democratic principles. To achieve the above requirements, it is first necessary to educate all workers to establish a sense of ownership of the country, strictly abide by labor discipline in accordance with the principles of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, actively improve production efficiency, and use practical model actions to further promote the capital side in private enterprises and factories, and work together to restore and develop production, and solve the employment problem from the restoration and development of production. For individual factories that deliberately transfer machinery and raw materials, unreasonably dismiss workers, and deliberately delay starting work, workers should cooperate with the government to persuade the capitalists to stop such behavior. On the issue of wages, on the one hand, we should oppose certain capitalists' deductions of wages and delays in payment to ensure the proper life of workers; but on the other hand, we must also persuade and criticize the inappropriate and excessive demands made by some workers, and the phenomenon of some workers not abiding by labor discipline. Workers must realize that improving workers' lives must be gradually resolved through developing and increasing production. When labor-capital disputes occur, labor and capital can adopt methods of consultation and negotiation to resolve them, and if consultation fails, they can submit to government arbitration. Finally, the meeting called on staff and workers to unite well, and comrades of the work group to promote democratic style, learn production knowledge, and become one with the workers, so as to truly achieve reliance on the working class, unite other democratic classes, and restore and develop urban production.

　　无锡职工总会筹委会讨论
  　努力解决复工就业问题
    【新华社无锡二十三日电】无锡市职工总会筹备会，于五月十六日召开全体委员与工作队队员会议，讨论如何恢复和发展城市生产，特别是如何首先解决目前的复工就业问题。无锡市解放后，规模较大的公私工厂大部分已先后开工、复工，一部分未开工的工厂也在积极筹备复工。公营无锡农具制造厂工人正准备在五月间把解放前未完成的两部引擎与五月份的任务一并突击完成。私营振新纱厂工人在敌机不断骚扰下，仍保持了一定的生产效率。但另一方面，也有少数私营工厂，由于对人民政府的工商业政策、劳动政策等不够了解，因此还没有主动地积极地去克服某些可以克服的原料、燃料、销路等困难，而对恢复与发展生产采取消极观望态度。根据上述情况，会上经讨论后决议：目前无锡市全体职工的中心任务，是扩大宣传教育，团结其他民主阶层，共同为恢复与发展生产，首先是为解决目前的复工与就业问题而努力，并由此逐步地按照民主原则建立职工会。为实现上述要求，必须首先要教育全体职工，树立国家主人翁思想，根据发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利方针，严格遵守劳动纪律，积极提高生产效率，以实际的模范行动，在私营企业工厂中进一步推动资方，共同努力恢复与发展生产，从恢复与发展生产中来解决就业问题。对于个别工厂故意转移机器原料、无理解雇工人、故意拖延开工的现象，职工们应协同政府劝导资方停止此等行为。在工资问题上，一方面应反对某些资方的克扣工资、拖延发放，以保障职工的适当生活；但另一方面对某些职工所提出的不适当的过高要求，和部分职工中不遵守劳动纪律的现象，也必须予以说服和批评。必须使职工认识，改善职工生活必须从发展与增加生产中逐步解决。劳资发生纠纷时，可由劳资双方采取协商、谈判方式解决，如协商不成，可提交政府仲裁。最后，会上提出号召职员与工人要很好团结，工作组同志要发扬民主作风，学习生产知识，与职工打成一片，以便真正达到依靠工人阶级，团结其他民主阶层，恢复与发展城市生产。
