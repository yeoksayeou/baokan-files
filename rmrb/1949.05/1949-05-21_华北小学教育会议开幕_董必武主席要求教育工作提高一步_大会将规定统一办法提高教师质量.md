The North China Primary Education Conference Opens
    Chairman Dong Biwu Calls for Advancement in Educational Work
    Conference to Establish Unified Methods for Improving Teacher Quality

　　[This Newspaper] The North China Primary Education Conference opened today at the Xiehe Auditorium. Those in attendance included leading cadres in charge of education administration from Taihang, Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan, Ji-Zhong, Ji-Dong, Chahar, Beiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang, Yangquan, Minister Chao Zhepofu of the Ministry of Education, Vice Ministers Liu Aifeng and Sun Wenshu, Mr. Ye Shengtao, Zhou Jianren, Sun Qimeng and other guests from various university education departments, and more than 250 cadres from the Ministry. Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, and Vice Chairmen Lan Gongwu and Yang Xiufeng, attended the meeting to provide guidance. The conference began with an opening speech by Minister Chao Zhepofu of the Ministry of Education, who explained that the spirit of this conference lies in how to solve all the difficult problems of rural and urban primary education. Chairman Dong Biwu then delivered a speech: Now that North China has been completely liberated, it is necessary to have the conference discuss and study various methods produced in the past in the decentralized environment of primary education that was adapted to the war, and determine a more unified approach.
    The primary education in the old liberated areas developed in the struggle against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Under extremely difficult conditions, it persisted and developed, playing a huge role in coordinating military and political struggles. This should be written as a special chapter in the history of education.
    Due to the changing circumstances today, some past systems need to be changed and unified. The task before us is to improve our educational work, which requires enriching educational administrators and improving the quality of teachers.
    Finally, Chairman Dong pointed out: Educators in the newly liberated large cities should establish the determination to serve the people and should run education according to the demands of the broad masses of the people. Regarding the issue of livelihood, Chairman Dong pointed out that it is only natural that the people's lives cannot maintain normal standards because there is still war. It is not surprising that those of us engaged in education have a slightly lower standard of living temporarily. We have gained political liberation, and education work has unlimited bright prospects, and we can still make a living.
    To improve our lives in the future, we need to work hard to produce, and we need to do a good job in education and strengthen students' understanding of labor, which will greatly help promote production.
    After Chairman Dong's speech, Vice Chairman Lan Gongwu gave a detailed explanation of the basic principles of New Democratic education and called on everyone to unleash their creativity to overcome all current difficulties. Mr. Ye Shengtao, Zhou Jianren, and Sun Qimeng all expressed their views on education in the liberated areas and made a vivid comparison with the reactionary and backward education in the Kuomintang areas. Mr. Ye Shengtao also pointed out that political goals should be integrated with one's own work. In Mr. Zhou Jianren's speech, he pointed out that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought should be implemented in education. The conference adjourned at 2:00 p.m.

　　华北小学教育会议开幕
    董必武主席要求教育工作提高一步
    大会将规定统一办法提高教师质量
    【本报讯】华北小学教育会议今日在协和礼堂揭幕。到会有：太行、太岳、冀鲁豫、冀南、冀中、冀东、察哈尔、北平、天津、太原、石家庄、阳泉等地教育行政负责干部，教育部晁哲甫部长，刘皑风、孙文淑副部长，叶圣陶、周建人、孙起孟等先生及各大学教育院系来宾，本部干部二百五十余人。华北人民政府董必武主席，蓝公武、杨秀峰副主席均莅会指导。大会首由教育部晁哲甫部长致开幕词，晁部长说明此次会议的精神在于如何解决农村、城市小学教育一切困难问题，继由董必武主席发表讲话：今天华北已经完全解放，需要把过去适应战争分散环境的小学教育工作中所产生的各种办法，请大会讨论研究，确定一个较为统一的办法。
    老解放区的小学教育，是在与日本帝国主义及国民党反动派斗争中发展起来的。在非常艰苦的条件下，它坚持并发展下去，在配合军事政治斗争上，起了巨大作用，这在教育史上，应写它特殊的一章。
    由于今天情况的变化，过去有些制度需要改变与统一。摆在我们面前的任务，是要把教育工作提高一步，这就需要充实教育行政人员，提高教师质量。
    最后，董主席指出：新解放大城市的教育工作者，应当确立为人民服务的决心，应当根据广大人民要求来办教育。关于生活问题，董主席指出由于现在还有战争，人民生活不能维持平时水准，是很自然的事。我们从事教育工作的人，生活上暂时低一点，亦不足怪，我们在政治上获得解放，教育工作有无限光明的前途，而且生活仍可以过得下去。
    要使我们今后生活提高，就需要我们努力生产，我们努力把教育办好，加强学生对劳动的认识，于推动生产有极大的帮助。
    董主席讲话后，即由蓝公武副主席对新民主主义教育的基本方针予以详尽的说明，并号召大家发挥创造力来克服目前的一切困难。叶圣陶、周建人、孙起孟先生均发表对解放区教育的观感并与国民党区反动倒退的教育做了生动的对比，叶圣陶先生并指出把政治目标和自己的工作融化一起。在周建人先生的讲话中指出把马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想贯彻到教育方面去。大会至中午二时休会。
