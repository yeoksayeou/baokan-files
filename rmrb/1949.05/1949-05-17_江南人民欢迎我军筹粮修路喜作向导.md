The broad masses of workers, peasants, students, and people of all strata in Jiangnan welcome the People's Liberation Army with unparalleled enthusiasm. Having suffered greatly under the ravages of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, they yearn for the People's Liberation Army as if longing for clouds in a great drought. Therefore, in many places, people spontaneously organize to prepare for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army upon hearing that the PLA has crossed the Yangtze River, and send representatives to welcome them from dozens of miles away. After the PLA arrives, they assist in the work in many ways. Workers in Nanjing and other places bravely protect factories, rescue materials, and collect weapons from scattered bandits. Students in Hangzhou and other places celebrate May Fourth, study revolutionary theories, and organize propaganda teams to explain the policies of the Chinese Communist Party to the citizens. In the vast countryside, especially in the old liberated areas of the land revolution era and the War of Resistance Against Japan, peasants boil tea, procure grain and fodder, act as guides, and repair roads. Many former Kuomintang government civil servants protect files and materials, awaiting takeover.

　　江南人民欢迎我军筹粮修路喜作向导
    江南的广大的工人、农民、学生和各阶层人民，以无比的热情欢迎人民解放军。他们受尽国民党匪帮的蹂躏，渴望人民解放军，好象大旱之望云霓，所以许多地方人民一听说解放军渡江，便自动组织起来准备迎接解放军，并派出代表到数十里外欢迎，而在解放军到达后更多方协助工作。南京等地工人英勇地保护工厂、抢救物资、收缴散匪武装。杭州等地学生庆祝五四，学习革命理论，组织宣传队，向市民解释中国共产党政策。广大农村，尤其是那些土地革命时代和抗日战争时代的老解放区，农民烧茶水、筹粮草、作向导、修道路。许多原国民党政府的公务人员则保护档案、物资、听候接收。
