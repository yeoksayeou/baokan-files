　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th. Private enterprises in Nanjing, such as Youheng Flour Company and Xinyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, have successively resumed production after obtaining approval from the Trade Corporation. Youheng Flour Company has two motors with 500 and 580 horsepower respectively, and 27 flour mills. If the power supply is sufficient, it can produce 8,000 bags of flour per day (44 jin per bag). When the city was first liberated, the company suspended work due to a lack of working capital. The Municipal Trade Corporation then purchased 2,900 bags of the factory's existing flour at market prices, enabling it to pay the April wages to all 240 employees. At the same time, a contract was signed with the company, using the method of advance payment to order finished products, to solve the difficulty of its working capital turnover. The company was able to resume work on the 10th. The Second Branch of the Municipal Trade Corporation also solved the capital difficulties of Xinyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory and Zhengming Weaving Factory by purchasing finished products, enabling the two factories to resume production.

　　南京私营企业先后恢复生产
    【新华社南京十七日电】南京市有恒面粉公司、新毅染织厂等私营企业，在得到贸易公司的批准后，已先后恢复生产。有恒面粉公司有五百和五百八十马力的马达各一具，磨粉机二十七座，若电力供应充足，可日产面粉八千袋（每袋四十四斤）。本市刚解放时，该公司因缺乏周转的资金而停工。市贸易总公司当按市价收购该厂存面二千九百袋，使其能发给全厂职工二百四十余人的四月份工资。同时又与该公司订立合同，以预先付款定购成品的办法，解决其资金周转的困难。该公司因得于十日复工。市贸易总公司第二分公司也用收购成品办法解决了新毅染织厂和正明织布厂的资金困难，使两厂得以恢复生产。
