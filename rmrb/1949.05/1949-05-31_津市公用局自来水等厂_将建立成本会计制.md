　　Tianjin Municipal Public Works Bureau Water and Electricity Plants
  　Will Establish Cost Accounting System
    [Tianjin Electric Dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal Public Works Bureau's Water Plant, Tram Management Office, and Public Bus Management Office have completed property inventory and valuation. They are now undertaking reforms of old accounts in order to initially establish a cost accounting system. At the end of March and beginning of April, each plant established a property inventory committee, with section chiefs from the administrative departments, employee representatives, military representatives, and work team leaders serving as members. Separate groups were formed by each department according to the nature of their work, and they proceeded with property inventory and valuation separately. The Tram Management Office had three members in each group, composed of one person each from the administrative department, worker representatives, and the work team or takeover team. The working steps were to first check various materials item by item based on the past inventory of property, then to make an assessment according to the market price (or the original purchase price if there was no market price) and the degree of depreciation. The departments collected and submitted the assessments to the accounting section, which, after review by the Public Works Bureau, transferred them to the new accounts. After completing the valuation work, the Tram Management Office also classified various properties and created property cards, detailing the condition and depreciation at various periods. When the depreciation period expired, this property would no longer be calculated. The Water Plant has now prepared a cost summary table based on property valuation, direct costs (water output and transmission costs), indirect costs (management fees), and a newly formulated accurate employee salary calculation method. The plant has formulated a water price calculation formula based on the cost from January to April, which will be implemented from June. The Tram Management Office and the Public Bus Management Office are conducting various statistical tasks related to cost. It is expected that a cost accounting system can be initially established by the end of June.

　　津市公用局自来水等厂
  　将建立成本会计制
    【天津电】津市公用局所属自来水厂、电车管理处及公共汽车管理处，已完成财产清审及估价工作，现正着手改革旧帐目，以便初步建立成本会计制度。在三月底、四月初，各厂先后成立财产清审委员会，由行政部门的科股长、职工代表、军事代表及工作组长分任委员，另由各部门按工作性质分成若干小组，分头进行财产的清审与估价。电车管理处每小组设组员三人，由行政部门、工人代表及工作组或接管组各一人组成。工作步骤是首先根据过去清点的财产底册，将各种器材逐一清查，然后按照市价（如无市价则按照原来买价）及其折旧程度作出估价，由各部门分别汇集交付会计股，经公用局审核后，即转入新帐。电车管理处在完成估价工作后，并将各种财产分类制成财产卡片，详细书明状况及各个时期的折旧情形，到折旧限期时，这一财产即可不再计算。现自来水厂已根据财产估价、直接成本（出水输水费用）、间接成本（管理费用）及重新制定的职工薪资精确计算法，制出成本汇总表。该厂已根据一月至四月的成本，制订水价计算公式，自六月份起实施。电车管理处和公共汽车管理处正进行与成本有关的各种统计工作。预计六月底可初步建立成本会计制度。
