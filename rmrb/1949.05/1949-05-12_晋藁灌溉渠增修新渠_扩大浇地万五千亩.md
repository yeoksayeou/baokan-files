[Jizhong Telegram] This spring, the Jin Gao Irrigation Canal has completed three new branch canals and renovated eight old ones. Water has now been released for irrigation, and cotton is being sown. This canal construction demonstrates that as long as the masses are mobilized, no difficulty is insurmountable. In the past, the Japanese devils believed that the canals for the four villages of Zhaozhuang, Mayu, etc., could not be supplied with water. Now, through the efforts of the people, these canals have been repaired, and the four villages have already irrigated over 2,000 mu of land. Anzhuang, Dong Silu, and other villages have opened three new branch canals, capable of irrigating 1,600 mu of land, with an estimated future expansion to 4,000 mu. All other villages have expanded their irrigated areas. According to statistics from 32 villages in five districts, a total of more than 15,000 mu of land has been added to the irrigated area. In this canal construction, labor mutual aid was organized in a planned manner, saving manpower. Women were also mobilized to participate in the canal construction. In Cuizhuang, women, children, and the elderly worked during the day, while young men worked at night. Due to this division of labor and mutual assistance, they irrigated over 500 mu of land more than other villages. In Xiaoshizhuang, because the land was high and the canal water could not reach it, the village dug water ponds next to the canal and installed five waterwheels for irrigation. Due to the release of water for irrigation, many villages have now begun sowing cotton. Wangzhuang and other villages have already planted one-third of their cotton, and it is estimated that the remaining irrigated land will be planted in another three or four days. To further expand the irrigated area, small branch canals and small sluice gates are being added. Efforts are being made to complete them before planting, and a second water release is being planned to universally irrigate the land for planting cotton and peanuts first.

    晋藁灌溉渠增修新渠
    扩大浇地万五千亩
    【冀中电】晋藁灌溉渠今春修好新支渠三道，整理旧支渠八道，现已提闸放水浇地，正播种棉花。从这次修渠中，证明了只要发动起群众力量来，就没有克服不了的困难，过去日本鬼子在筑渠中，认为没法上水的赵庄、马于等四个村的渠道现经人民的努力都已修好，四村现已浇地两千多亩。安庄、东四吕等村，开出新支渠三道，能浇地一千六百亩，预计将来能扩大到四千亩。其他各村都扩大了浇地面积。据五个区三十二个村的统计，共扩大浇地面积一万五千多亩。在这次修筑渠道中，有计划的组织了劳动互助，节省了人力。并发动妇女，参加了修渠。崔庄白天是妇女、小孩、老头们做活，晚上是青壮年小伙子们做，由于分工互助，比别村多浇地五百多亩。小石庄因地高渠水浇不上去，该村就在渠道旁边挖了水垣，按上五辆水车浇地。由于放水浇地，现在已经很多村庄，开始了播种棉花；王庄等已种了有三分之一，大约再有三四天水浇地就能耩完了。为了再继续扩大浇地面积，正在增开小支渠修小闸。争取在耩地前修好，现在正计划第二次放水，普遍先浇种棉花和花生的地。
