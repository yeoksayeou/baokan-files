Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 17th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing north along the east coast, has reached the Yangtze Estuary. On the 14th and 15th, they liberated the two county towns east of Shanghai, Nanhui and Chuansha. In the two locations, a total of one battalion each of the 209th Division of the 37th Army and the Provisional 8th Division, one company of the 123rd Army, one entire security regiment, and over a hundred members of the Nanhui County Security Team were annihilated. At the same time, another PLA force advancing eastward along the Yangtze River captured the two important enemy strongholds of Yuepu and Liuhang northwest of Shanghai. Yuepu and Liuhang are both less than forty li from Shanghai and are important defensive areas in the Shanghai periphery, fortified with solid and complex modern fortifications. In addition to a cluster of steel and concrete pillboxes, Liuhang also had ten outer moats, electric fences, barbed wire, wooden stakes, landmines, and five rivers. The enemy attempted to use these fortifications to resist stubbornly, but the People's Liberation Army, with the support of powerful artillery units, attacked valiantly and, after a night of fierce fighting, broke through the enemy's defenses and completely occupied the aforementioned two important strongholds.
