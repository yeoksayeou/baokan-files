Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: TASS Rome dispatch: Six hundred thousand agricultural workers in the Po River Valley and Lazio province of northern Italy, following the decision of the Agricultural Workers' Union and the General Confederation of Labour Secretariat, began a strike on the 18th. It is understood that if the Landlords' Federation refuses to negotiate with representatives of the agricultural workers, the strike will expand to all of Italy's 2.5 million agricultural workers. The strike was announced after the landlords refused to negotiate with the Agricultural Workers' Union and the General Confederation of Labour to sign a national unified labor contract for agricultural workers. The General Confederation of Labour demands that certain conditions regarding employment and wages won by workers in other sectors of Italy should also apply to agricultural workers; that the new labor contract should apply to all provinces; and that it should determine a daily minimum wage, holiday pay, and the right to unemployment relief. The General Confederation of Labour also demands a guarantee against arbitrary dismissal and the development of wasteland to improve the living conditions of unemployed agricultural workers.

    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利北部波河流域和拉佐亚省六十万农业工人遵照农业工人联合会和总工会书记处的决定，于十八日起举行罢工。据悉：如地主联合会拒绝与农业工人代表谈判，则罢工将扩及全意所有二百五十万农业工人。罢工系在地主拒绝与农业工人联合会和总工会谈判为农业工人签订全国性的单一劳工合同后宣布。总工会要求：意大利其他部门工人赢得的若干关于就业与工资的条件，应同样适用于农业工人，新的劳动合同应适用于一切省份，并确定每日最低工资，假日工资与失业救济的权利。总工会并要求保证不受专横的解雇，进行开荒以改善失业的农业工人生活情况。
