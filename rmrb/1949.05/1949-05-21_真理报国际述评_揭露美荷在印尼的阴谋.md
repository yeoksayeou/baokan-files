  　Exposing the US-Dutch Conspiracy in Indonesia
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th】TASS dispatch: The Truth Daily published on the 16th an international review by Chai Chaiqina, exposing the Dutch imperialist conspiracy in Indonesia, stating: When the Dutch aggressors were unable to crush the Indonesian people's struggle by force, they wanted to conclude an "agreement" with the Republic. But after regaining strength and reacquiring armaments from the US and Britain, the Dutch aggressors once again perfidiously attacked the Republic. Recently, due to their inability to suppress the Indonesian people's growing anti-imperialist struggle and the expanding guerrilla warfare, the Dutch imperialists and their American protectors, in this new situation, are once again repeating their tricks and have decided to conclude a new "agreement" with the so-called "Hatta government." The Netherlands is willing to cooperate with the Hatta group, supposedly to facilitate the "restoration of peace and the maintenance of order in Indonesia." The "Hatta government" naturally agrees to this. Hatta has promised to urge the Indonesian people to cease armed resistance against the aggressors. What will the Republic of Indonesia look like after the conclusion of this new "agreement"? According to the "agreement" concluded between Hatta and the Netherlands, the Republic will only govern an area of ​​about twenty miles and two and a half million people. This will be the situation of the Republic after the agreement concluded in Batavia. For the sake of this "magnanimity" of the Dutch imperialists, the seventy million people of the Republics of Java, Sumatra, and Madura must immediately cease guerrilla warfare and abandon their rights to freedom and independence.
    The author writes: Shortly before the Batavia "agreement," Mr. Cochran, the US representative on the United Nations Indonesia Committee, said: In view of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it is necessary to "resolve the Indonesian issue as soon as possible." The main reason for the Batavia "agreement" lies here: the United States is pursuing a policy of suppressing the Indonesian people's resistance in order to turn Indonesia into an operational base to deal with the Asian people's liberation movement. At the same time, the Batavia "agreement" is needed by the US and Dutch ruling groups in order to reduce world public attention to the Indonesian issue and to prevent the current UN General Assembly from discussing this issue.
    Chai Chaiqina concludes: No matter what tricks the imperialists, colonialists, and their accomplices invent, the Indonesian people will never submit to the fate that the Dutch and American aggressors are preparing for them because of these tricks.

  　揭露美荷在印尼的阴谋
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社讯：真理报十六日刊载柴柴契娜所著国际述评，揭露荷兰帝国主义在印尼的阴谋称：荷兰侵略者在不能够以武力粉碎印尼的人民斗争时，就想与共和国缔结“协议”。但在重新获得力量和自美英重新得到军备以后，荷兰侵略者又再次背信弃义地袭击共和国。最近由于无法镇压印尼人民日益增长的反帝国主义斗争及扩大的游击战争，荷兰帝国主义及其美国保护人在这种新的情况下，再次重复他们的诡计，又决定与所谓“哈达政府”订立新“协议”。荷兰愿意与哈达集团合作，据说是为了便利“恢复和平及保持印尼的治安”。“哈达政府”自然同意这点。哈达答应敦促印尼人民停止对侵略者的武装抵抗。在订立这一新“协议”之后的印尼共和国将是什么样子呢？根据哈达与荷兰所缔结的“协议”，受共和国管辖的只有周围二十哩的地区及二百五十万人民。这将是在巴达维亚缔结协议以后的共和国情况。为着荷兰帝国主义者的这一“宽宏大量”，在瓜哇、苏门答腊与马都拉的共和国的七千万人民须得立即停止游击战及放弃自由与独立的权利。
    该文作者写道：在巴达维亚“协议”以前不久，联合国印尼委员会美方代表柯契伦曾说：鉴于中国人民解放军的胜利，有必要“尽快地解决印尼问题”。巴达维亚“协议”的主要原因是在这里：美国从事压制印尼人民抵抗的政策，以便将印尼变为对付亚洲人民解放运动的作战基地。同时巴达维亚“协议”是美国与荷兰统治集团所需要的，以便用以减少世界公众对于印尼问题的注意及阻止本届联合国大会对于这一问题的讨论。
    柴柴契娜结语称：无论帝国主义者，殖民主义者及其同谋者发明什么样的诡计，印尼人民决不会因为这些诡计来使他们自己服从荷兰与美国侵略者所正在为他们准备的命运。
