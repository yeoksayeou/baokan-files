　　Italian Socialist Left Leader
  　Nenni Elected Secretary-General
  　Wallace Sends Regards on Behalf of American Peace Fighters
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 21st] According to TASS: The leader of the Italian Socialist Party's left wing, Nenni, was recently elected as the party's Secretary-General. Nenni served as the chairman of the Socialist Party since Italy's surrender. At the party's 27th Congress in early July last year, he was squeezed out by the centrists and rightists. American Progressive Party leader Wallace telegraphed Nenni to congratulate him, saying: "America’s peace fighters salute the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian people. Fascism and Nazism must be eradicated. We value the connections between all nations that desire peace and are prepared to fight for such connections."
