　　Enforce Labor Discipline Strictly
  　People's Printing Plant Technician Wang Weiqin Dismissed for Repeated Absenteeism and Failure to Reform Despite Repeated Admonitions
    [Our Newspaper] Following worker input, the state-owned People's Printing Plant in Beiping dismissed Wang Weiqin, a technician in the letterpress printing division, for repeatedly violating labor discipline and failing to reform despite repeated education. Wang Weiqin was originally an unemployed worker who had participated in Kuomintang reactionary armed forces and plainclothes detective organizations during his unemployment. After liberation, most of the workers previously laid off by the Kuomintang were reinstated. At that time, Wang Weiqin went to the home of Yu Shifa, the head of the division, and threatened him, saying: "If you don't let me return to work, I'll break your legs!" After infiltrating the factory, he was consistently passive in his work and was absent from work several times without leave. Despite repeated criticism, he never changed. When the factory was evaluating wages, Wang Weiqin even threatened Yu Shifa, saying: "If you rate me low, we'll settle this outside!" When the leadership discovered this, they criticized and educated him, and he superficially admitted his mistakes, but he continued to be passive and slack off, failing to observe labor discipline. In one month, he was continuously absent for three days without leave and intermittently absent for two days. After discussion by the division's staff and workers, they unanimously demanded that Wang Weiqin be expelled from the factory. The factory immediately accepted everyone's opinion and removed his name from the rolls. The factory administration and the trade union preparatory committee also recently obtained the consent of all the factory's staff and workers and announced labor discipline regulations, stipulating strict adherence to working hours, obedience to administrative leadership, and that employees could promptly submit opinions to the administrative organizational system, or submit opinions and make clear statements to higher levels.

　　严肃劳动纪律
  　平人民印制厂技工王维勤任意旷工屡劝不改被开除
    【本报讯】北平国营人民印制厂接受工人意见，开除数次违犯劳动纪律，屡经教育不改之铅印股技工王维勤。王维勤原系失业工人，失业期间曾参加国民党反动武装及便衣侦探等组织。解放后，前被国民党裁减之工人大部复工，王维勤即于当时前往该股股长郁士法家中威胁说：“你不准我复工，打折你的腿！”混入该厂后，工作一贯消极，未经请假无故旷工数次，屡经批评，始终不改。该厂评议工资时，王维勤竟又威胁郁士法说：“你要评低我的级数，咱们外边见面”！领导上发现了，即对其批评教育，他也表面上承认了错误，但此后仍是消极怠工，不遵守劳动纪律，一月中连续不请假而旷工者三天，间断旷工者两天。后经该股职工讨论，一致要求将王维勤开除出厂，厂方当即接受大家意见，将其除名。该厂行政及职工筹委会并于日前征得全厂职工同意，公布劳动纪律，规定严格遵守上下班时间，服从行政领导，职工如有意见，可及时向行政组织系统提出，或越级提出意见，申述明白。
