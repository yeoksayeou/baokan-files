    Convenes Symposium of Worker Representatives
    Nanjing Takes Over Reactionary Cultural Organizations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Wuxi News: On the fifth day after Wuxi's liberation (April 28th), the Military Control Commission invited over a hundred worker representatives from various public and private enterprises and factories to hold a symposium. This was the first symposium convened by the Military Control Commission after entering the city.管文蔚 Guan Wenwei, Director of the Military Control Commission, 顾风 Gu Feng, Mayor, and 谢克东 Xie Kedong, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, all attended and presided over the meeting. Director Guan extended cordial greetings to the worker representatives and explained the current situation and the people's government's labor policies. He called on the workers to unite and organize themselves even better, and to work hard for the restoration and development of urban production. At the meeting, worker representatives expressed their opinions, recounting their painful lives under the rule of the Kuomintang and the collusion of pseudo-labor unions with secret agents to persecute workers, and exposing bad elements who fabricated various rumors to obstruct workers from returning to work. Mayor Gu Feng and Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Xie Kedong answered the questions raised by the worker representatives one by one, and emphasized that the people's government relies on Wuxi's 150,000 workers and unites the people of the city to manage and build Wuxi well, and requested that workers in factories mobilize workers who have gone to the countryside to return to the factories in order to quickly restore production.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Nanjing Military Control Commission's work of taking over the original Kuomintang reactionary cultural organizations is continuing. Following the takeover of reactionary newspapers and news agencies such as the Central News Agency, Central Daily News, Peace Daily, and National Salvation Daily, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Military Control Commission dispatched personnel on the 5th to take over publishing organizations such as the reactionary Kuomintang's Zhengzhong Bookstore, China Cultural Service Society, Independent Publishing House, and Bati Bookstore, which consistently promoted fascist culture.
