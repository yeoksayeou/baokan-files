　　Yuan Dynasty Fourth District Opens Up Wasteland
  　Increases Planting of Cash Crops
    [Jinan News] The Fourth District of the Yuan Dynasty is located near the old course of the Yellow River, and is mostly sandy wasteland. Last year, after a call to action, some of the land was opened up and planted with crops such as beans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, which grew very well, yielding 150 jin of beans per mu. Since the beginning of spring, the district government has proposed that no public grain be collected for three years for opening up wasteland, and the masses are vying to open up wasteland. For example, Shuangmiao Village opened up 67 mu of wasteland and planted peanuts on all of it. The women of Qianshalou Village also voluntarily organized an eight-person wasteland reclamation team, and have already opened up 15 mu of land, planning to plant 10 mu of peanuts and 5 mu of cotton. Currently, the entire district has opened up 2,819.5 mu of wasteland. The masses are now continuing to actively open up wasteland and expand the area for planting cash crops.

　　元朝四区开荒
  　增种经济作物
    【冀南讯】元朝四区靠黄河故道，多是飞沙荒地，去年经过号召有的开起来种上豆子、花生、红薯一类作物，结果长的很好，每亩有收到一百五十斤豆子的。入春以来，区政府即提出开生荒地三年不纳公粮，群众争相开荒。如双庙村开荒六十七亩，都种上花生，前沙河楼村的妇女也自愿组织了八个人的开荒小组，已开荒地十五亩，准备种花生十亩，棉花五亩。现全区已开好荒地二千八百十九亩半。现在群众正在继续积极开荒，扩大种植经济作物的面积。
