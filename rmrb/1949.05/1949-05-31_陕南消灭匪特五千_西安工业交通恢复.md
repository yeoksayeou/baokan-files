Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shaanxi, 30th – The People's Liberation Army's Southern Shaanxi Military Region, in coordination with the victorious advance of the Northwest Front, has launched a powerful military and political offensive against bandits in various regions, achieving significant results. From mid-April to mid-May, in a period of forty days, more than thirty armed bandit and special agent groups of the Kuomintang were dealt with. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 1,780 bandits were killed or captured. In seven instances, bandit leaders were persuaded to surrender with their troops, and more than 3,500 people surrendered their weapons, registered, and returned home to resume their occupations. A total of two mortars, four small cannons, ten light and heavy machine guns, and more than 1,340 long and short firearms were seized. Currently, various localities are taking advantage of the victory to expand the offensive, closely connect with the masses, gradually establish and transform village-level political power, and organize the masses for bandit prevention and self-defense, in order to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits.

Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station Broadcast: Xi'an, 30th - Since the liberation of Xi'an, democratic order has been rapidly established. The Xi'an Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, after entering the city on the 20th, dispatched sentries to maintain order and protect important factories and buildings. The garrison strictly enforced urban policies and mass discipline, which was warmly praised by the broad masses of the people. Employees of Xi'an's major industrial, transportation, and telecommunications departments bravely protected factory equipment before liberation, and immediately began to resume work after liberation. The People's Liberation Army sends trucks to the streets every day to conduct propaganda, and the propaganda trucks are immediately surrounded by the citizens wherever they go. From the 22nd to the 24th, in three days, 50,000 to 60,000 copies of propaganda materials were distributed, and there were approximately 60,000 to 70,000 listeners.
