How to Reform Old Operas?
    Starting with the Performances of the North China Ping Opera Theater in Shijiazhuang

    Today, in many liberated cities, old operas still dominate the performance programs of old opera troupes and the advertisements in newspapers, occupying an absolute advantage. With the imminent liberation of all major cities across the country, we will be faced with a multitude of old theaters and a large group of old performers. Can we simply ban all the old operas that propagate the feudal rulers? Therefore, I believe that reforming old operas and transforming old performers should be regarded as an important task of urban cultural work today. So, I will briefly introduce the ten or more completely new historical drama evening programs and the mass reactions of the North China Ping Opera Research Institute's farewell performance in Shijiazhuang for the reference of comrades engaged in the reform of old operas:

    I. Combining Learning with Practice, Breaking Down Sectarianism

    First, make the performers understand that the idea of serving the people is glorious, and enlighten their class consciousness through professional study. Using old operas familiar to the performers, analyze them in detail. For example, when talking about "Xiaoyaojin," explain who it served, starting from Emperor Xian of Han and analyzing that it was a group of landlords fighting among themselves, using the people's blood and sweat to compete for personal power, which is all wrong. Propagating the orthodox ideology for Emperor Xian of Han is even more wrong. Explain that old operas are propaganda tools used by the rulers to numb the people, trying to make them be exploited and oppressed forever. Make the performers deeply understand that "art has class character." Then singing reactionary old operas (excluding reformed old operas) and acting as propagandists for the feudal rulers is a disgrace. It clearly explains the specific manifestation of performers (actors) serving the people, which is: performing operas for workers, peasants, and soldiers, or historical dramas with educational significance, so that they can recognize the direction of drama serving workers, peasants, and soldiers from their minds. Under this general direction, further break down the sectarian ideas of the performers. Patiently and thoroughly analyze the past so-called "Jing School" actors from a revolutionary point of view, referring to the performers who sing operas in Beijing, who cater to the tastes of those Qing Dynasty relics and parasites living in Beijing, providing them with entertainment and promoting feudalism, serving the feudal forces. The "Hai School" actors refer to some performers who sing operas in Shanghai. Although they have made some improvements in some aspects, they absolutely cannot talk about any reform. The content is still promoting the feudal order, and the form is to cater to the tastes of bureaucratic capitalists as much as possible, leading to decline. They are dramas that serve comprador bureaucratic capitalists. Therefore, we should not rush to discuss it, neither of which is what we need. We should perform operas that workers, peasants, and soldiers like, operas that cater to the tastes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we should create operas that serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this way, while rehearsing operas, while performing operas, and attending classes at the same time, the performers do not feel that attending classes is a burden, and they feel interested. Their minds are quickly opened. The more they listen, the more they like to listen, and they are talking about their own affairs, which are fresh and interesting. After studying and then performing old operas, some comrades said: "When I sing Emperor Xian of Han ('Xiaoyaojin'), 'cheating the widower for being long, cheating the widower for being short,' who is cheating whom? The more people applaud when I sing it, the more uncomfortable I feel, and I simply can't sing it. We performers in the past were all born in extreme poverty, why should we speak for the feudal landlords? Why weren't these truths told to us earlier?" and so on, so they are particularly energetic when rehearsing new operas, with great enthusiasm.

    II. Introduction of Recently Performed Programs

    In different forms, under the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, newly arranged and performed historical dramas with new viewpoints include: "Spark of Songshan," "Emerald Garden," "Two Ingots of Silver," "Red Maid," "Daming Prefecture," "Eleventh Son," "Li Kui Seizes Fish," "Entering Chang'an," "Red Turban Uprising," "Yufushan," "River God Marries a Bride," "Forced to Liangshan," and "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang." From these operas, it can be seen that from ancient times to the present, feudal rulers, bureaucrats, landlords, and running dogs colluded together, using political power, land, and usury to oppress the people. The people have suffered insults and oppression, and have been unable to breathe under feudal rule for thousands of years. It clearly tells the audience: "Poor people all over the world are one family, and the common enemies are only bureaucrats and landlords. There is nowhere to appeal for grievances, and only by standing up to rebel can there be a way out" (general meaning of the lines in "Red Turban Uprising"), proving that farmers will only truly be liberated when they get land, and clearly telling the audience that whoever bows and surrenders to the rulers will only have a dead end, such as the death of Zhou Yu and his wife in "Two Ingots of Silver." The crimes of the feudal rulers have been ironclad evidence for thousands of years, placed in front of the people, "Whoever forgives the rulers is a sinner to the people, because from history to today, many facts prove that feudal bureaucrats have never relaxed their grip on the people, such as the fate of the poor scholar in 'Emerald Garden.' Furthermore, 'Red Maid' and 'Daming Prefecture' illustrate that even Lu Junyi and Li Xin, who are of the same class as the rulers, want to do good things for the people and sympathize with the people's suffering, but are unwilling to go with the people and abide by the rules, but are still tortured by the rulers. This tells them (Li Xin, Lu Junyi, enlightened gentry, intellectuals) that if they want to make progress and do something beneficial for the people, they can only stand with the people and overthrow the rulers together, otherwise the rulers will not tolerate those who do things for the people." What is even more worthy of vigilance is that when the people are victorious, those shameless rulers will not admit their defeat. They are constantly thinking of making a comeback and extinguishing the power of the people. They hide, use sweet words, pretend to be pitiful, and use shameless means to exploit loopholes: "Using big words to stop Liu Zongmin (rebel general), using a beauty trap to ensnare Li Chuangwang, waiting for the opportunity to seize power, Chuangwang's world will be ours" (lines of Zhang Guoshen, an official of the Ming Dynasty, in the play "Entering Chang'an"). "Entering Chang'an" tells the audience that after the enemy's army collapses, they must be a thousand times more vigilant against those hidden enemies, "Our every move is related to the happiness and life and death of the people in the whole city" (lines of Chuangwang in "Entering Chang'an").

    New Realistic Opera "Four Persuasions" and "Seeking Rain."

    "Four Persuasions" reflects the happy and organized life in the countryside after land reform and establishes a new attitude towards labor. It absorbs the good parts of Ping Opera and abandons those low-level and dirty things. It is different from civilized drama. It has new political ideas, educational significance, singing and dancing, making Ping Opera more directly serve reality, proving that reforming Ping Opera can make our policies guide reality through stage images. It has aroused the interest and welcome of the audience in many performances.

    Fables in Opera: "Mr. Dong Guo and the Wolf"

    This form of Ping Opera is still an attempt to reform old operas. It more clearly tells the audience that whoever pities the wolf will be eaten by the wolf, "People should be eaten for being friends with the wolf" (criticizing Mr. Dong Guo's lines), clearly criticizing Mr. Dong Guo's "universal love" viewpoint without a stand. This opera is closely combined with the current Chinese situation. It points out that whoever pities Chiang Kai-shek's diehard clique today is an accomplice of Chiang Kai-shek's diehard clique. If the wolf pack that eats people from Chiang Kai-shek's diehard clique is not swept away, those diehard wolves will still eat people when they recover from their injuries. This opera serves current politics more directly and educates many viewers.

    III. Reflections After the Performance of New Operas

    These new operas have won the praise of the general audience in many performances. After the performance at North China University, the general reflection of the students was: "This kind of meaningful and realistic opera is the first time I have seen it. If it is performed in the city, it can connect the relationship between the city and the countryside, and make the urban people understand the rural situation after land reform" (referring to "Four Persuasions").

    When performing for the Workers' Congress of Shijiazhuang, some worker representatives said: "I didn't like to watch old operas in the past because I couldn't understand them, and there was nothing about us in them, but this time I watched new operas such as 'Red Turban Uprising', and I felt really happy after watching it all. It's all about the poor people turning over. I hope you can perform it for us a few more times!" They also gave enthusiastic opinions.

    The cadres' reflection: "Your new opera (referring to 'Entering Chang'an') is a big step forward compared to the past. It not only has educational significance, but also has a protagonist, and there are no more of those verbose scenes. It is attractive, and I want to see it again after watching it once." Although there are fewer reflections from the general public, they are always asking when "Four Persuasions" and "Red Maid" will be performed again, those operas are really good. When "Two Ingots of Silver" was about to end, the actors on the stage had not yet spoken, and the audience immediately pointed to the bill collector who forced people to die and shouted: "Beat, beat, beat", which shows that although the opera is small, it plays a certain educational role. Judging from the number of audiences alone, there were six or seven theaters performing at the same time (and there was also the Northeast Liberation Ping Opera Troupe newly arrived from Tianjin). Only the people who watched the new opera were many, and they were crowded every day, while the theaters that only performed old operas had very few people, proving that the citizens like to watch new operas. These aspects prove that the performed new operas have also played a good effect among the citizens. Reflections from the art world: In this performance, the new operas not only received good reviews from the general audience, but also many famous actors in the old art world in Shijiazhuang went to see it almost every day, and each troupe scrambled to copy the script. In this performance, it not only educated the masses, but also played a great influence and promotion role in the drama movement.

    In short, from the creation and performance of these scripts and the reaction of the masses, we have gained some new experiences: (1) Not only historical events can be written into new historical dramas with new viewpoints and methods, but also current reality can be written into new operas and performed in the form of old operas. (2) Old performers can not only accept our leadership, but also improve the performers' awareness if combined with professional study, so that they can gradually transform and use their technology to serve revolutionary propaganda. (3) The performances of these operas have received good responses, proving that the masses after liberation like to watch operas with new content; it also shows that the methods and steps of reforming old operas can be gradually innovated to reduce toxins and further serve the current political tasks. (4) Judging from these performances, there has been little improvement in the matching of makeup, costumes, and music, and the arrangement is not delicate enough, which has reduced the effect of the drama. This requires the reformers of old operas and the performers to jointly make thorough improvements in the gradual improvement!

### 如何改革旧剧？  从华北平剧院在石家庄的演出起说

    如何改革旧剧？
    从华北平剧院在石家庄的演出起说
    今天在解放了的许多城市里，与解放区的旧剧团体，在演出节目上与报纸上的宣传广告上看，旧戏仍然占绝对的优势。在全国大城市即将全部解放的今天，入城后旧戏院子一大堆，旧艺人一大群，全部是替封建统治者们宣传的旧剧，我们能一下统统禁止吗？因此我认为改革旧剧，改造旧艺人，应看成是今天城市文艺工作的重要任务。所以我把华北平剧研究院在石家庄临别演出的十余个完全新历史剧的晚会节目及群众反映简单介绍一下，供从事改革旧剧的同志们作参考：
    一、学习与业务结合，打破门户之见
    首先使艺人们了解为人民服务的思想是光荣的，通过业务学习，启发他们的阶级觉悟。用艺人熟悉的旧戏，详细分析，如说到“逍遥津”是为谁服务的，从汉献帝说起，分析到是一群地主混战，用人民的血汗来争夺个人的权势，都不对，替汉献帝宣传正统思想更不对等等，说明旧戏是统治者麻醉人民的宣传工具，想使人民永远受其剥削和压迫。使艺人深刻了解“艺术是有阶级性的”，再唱反动的旧戏（改造的旧戏不在内，当封建统治者们的宣传员，是耻辱的。明确的说明了艺人（演员）为人民服务的具体表现，是：演为工、农、兵的戏，或有教育意义的历史剧，使他们从思想里认识戏剧为工、农、兵服务的方针，在总的方针下再进行打破艺人宗派思想。耐心详细的用革命的观点分析过去的所谓京派角，是指在北京唱戏的艺人，是迎合那些住在北京的清室遗老寄生虫们的口味的，供他们消遣，替封建者宣传的，给封建势力服务的。海派角是指在上海一些唱戏的艺人，虽然在某些方面有些改进，但绝谈不到什么改革，内容仍是宣传封建秩序的，形式上尽量迎合官僚资本家的口味，走向没落，他们是替买办官僚资本家服务的戏剧。因此我们都不应该急论它，都不是我们所需要的，我们应该演工农兵喜欢的戏，迎合工农兵口味的戏，我们要创作为工农兵服务的戏，这样一边排戏，一边演戏，同时上课，艺人们不觉着听课是负担，并感到兴趣，脑子很快的就打开了。越听越爱听，说的都是我们自己的事，又新鲜又有趣。在学习后再演旧戏，有同志说：“我唱汉献帝（逍遥津）欺寡人长，欺寡人短，谁欺负谁来？唱的越有人叫好，越难受，简直唱不上来了，我们过去唱戏的出身都是赤贫，为什么给封建地主说话呢？这些道理为什么不给我们早讲呢？”等等，所以排起新戏来特别卖力气，热劲很大。
    二、介绍最近演出的节目
    用不同的形式，在为工农兵服务的方针下，最近排出与演出新观点的历史剧计有：“嵩山星火”、“翡翠园”、“两锭银子”、“红娘子”、“大名府”、“十一郎”、“李逵夺鱼”、“进长安”、“红巾起义”、“鱼腹山”、“河伯娶妇”、“逼上梁山”、“三打祝家庄”。从这些戏里可以看出，从古至今封建统治者，官僚、地主、走狗三位一体勾结在一起，利用政权、土地、高利贷，压榨人民，人民受尽侮辱压迫，几千年来在封建统治下喘不过气来，很明确的告诉观众：“天下穷人是一家，共同敌人只有官僚和地主，有冤无处诉，只有挺身造反才有生路”（红巾起义台词大意），证明了农民只有得到土地，才会真正的得到解放，并很明白的说给观众，谁向统治者们低头投降，只有一条死路，如“两锭银子”的周羽夫妇之死，封建统治者的罪恶几千年来铁般的甘证，摆在人民面前，“谁要宽恕了统治者们，那他就是人民的罪人，因为从历史到今天，很多实事证明，封建官僚对人民是没有一次丝毫放松过的，如‘翡翠园’的穷书生的下场就是如此。再从‘红娘子’、‘大名府’说明了就是与统治者同阶级的卢俊义和李信，想给人民作点好事，同情人民的痛苦，但又不愿意给人民一道，安份守己，但最后仍被执政者用苦刑拷打，这告诉他们（李信、卢俊义开明士绅、知识分子）要想进步，替人民做些有益的事，只有和人民站在一起，一同推翻统治者，否则统治者不会容替人民办事的人的”。更值得警惕的，是当人民胜利了的时候，那些无耻的统治者们，是不会承认他们失败的，他们无时无刻的想卷土重来，扑灭人民的力量，他们暗藏起来，甜言蜜语，装出一付可怜象，用无耻的手段钻空子：“用大话说住了刘宗敏（闯王将官），用美人计套住了李闯王，等待时机抓住大权，闯王的天下就是我们的”（“进长安”剧中明室官僚张国绅台词）。“进长安”告诉了观众，敌人军队垮了之后，更要千倍的警惕那些暗藏的敌人，“我们的一举一动对全城的老百姓的幸福、生死是有关连的”（进长安闯王台词）。
    新现实歌剧“四劝”、“求雨”。
    “四劝”是反映土改后农村愉快有组织的生活，树立了新的劳动态度。它吸取了平剧好的部分，抛弃了那些低级肮脏的东西，他不同于文明戏，它有新的政治思想，有宣传教育意义，有歌有舞，使平剧更直接服务于现实，证明改革平剧能使我们的政策通过舞台形象来指导现实。在多次演出中引起了观众的兴趣与欢迎。
    富言剧：“中山狼”
    这种形式的平剧，还是改革旧剧的一种尝试，它更明确的告诉观众，谁要怜悯狼，一定被狼吃掉，“人给狼作朋友该吃”（批评东国先生台词），很明快的批评了东国先生无立场的“兼爱”观点，这个戏与现实的中国时局结合很紧，它指明了今天谁要怜悯死党蒋介石，谁就是蒋介石死党们的帮凶，不把死党蒋介石的吃人的狼群扫荡尽，那些死党狼一样，等伤养们仍然是要吃人的，这个戏给现实政治更直接的服了务，教育了很多的观众。
    三、新戏演出后的反映
    这些新戏在多次的演出中，博得了广大观众的好评：在华北大学演出后，同学们总的反映：“这种有意义的真实的戏，还是第一次看到，如果在城市里演出，可以沟通城市与乡村的关系，使城市人民了解土地改革后的农村情况”（指“四劝”）。
    给石家庄工人代表会演出时，有的工人代表讲：“过去我就不爱看旧戏，因为我看不懂，那里边也没有我们的事，但我这次看了‘红巾起义’等新戏，我一直看完真痛快，都说的是穷人翻身的事，希望你们多给我们演几次吧！”他们并很热情给提出了意见。
    干部们的反映：“你们的新戏（指‘进长安’），比过去进了一大步，不但有教育意义，而且有了主角，也没有那些罗嗦场子了，有吸引力，看了一遍还想看”。在一般的市民反映虽少，但在演出中，他们总在打听“四劝”，“红娘子”什么时候再演，那些戏真好，“两锭银子”演到快完时，台上演员还没有讲话，台下即指着逼人命要帐鬼喊着：“打、打、打”，可以看出戏虽小，但起到一定的教育意义，就单从观众的数量看，同时演出的戏园子六七个（还有新从天津来的东北解放平剧团）唯看新戏的人多，每日拥挤，别的纯演旧戏的园子人则很少，证明市民是喜欢看新戏的。由这几方面证明演出的新戏在市民中也起到了良好的效果。艺界的反映：在这次的演出，新戏不但在一般观众中得到了好评，就是在石家庄同行旧艺界许多名角差不多每天去看，并且各剧社抢着抄剧本，在这次的演出中，不但教育了群众，并且在剧运工作上也起到很大的影响与推动作用。
    总之，从这些剧本的创作、演出、与群众的反映来看，使我们得到了几点新的体验：（一）不但历史事件，可以用新的观点、方法，写成新历史剧，当前的现实同样可以写成新戏用旧剧的形式演出。（二）旧艺人不但可以接受我们的领导，如果结合业务的学习，还可以提高艺人的觉悟，使他们逐步改造，拿自己的技术为革命宣传服务。（三）这些戏的演出，都得到了好的反映，证明解放后的群众是欢喜多看新内容的戏；同时也说明改革旧剧的方法、步骤是可以逐步推陈出新，达到使旧剧减少毒素，进一步为现实政治任务服务的目的。（四）从这几次演出上来看，化妆、服装、音乐的配合等都很少改进，编排也不够精致，减少了不少戏剧的效果，这里就需要旧剧改革者和艺人共同在逐步提高中加以彻底的改进！
