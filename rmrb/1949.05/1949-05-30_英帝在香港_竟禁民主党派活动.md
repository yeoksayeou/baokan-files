　　British Imperialists in Hong Kong
  　Actually Ban Democratic Parties' Activities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th] Following the British authorities in Singapore's order on the 9th of this month to prohibit the activities of foreign political groups, including the China Democratic League, the British government's Legislative Council in Hong Kong passed a "Societies Ordinance" on the 25th, prohibiting the activities of foreign political parties. The purpose of this regulation is clearly aimed at the Chinese democratic parties in Hong Kong. In addition, the British authorities in Hong Kong have planned to flatten several Chinese residents' villages along the coast of Deep Bay to build an airport. This matter has aroused strong opposition from local residents.

　　英帝在香港
  　竟禁民主党派活动
    【新华社北平二十八日电】继本月九日新嘉坡英国当局命令禁止包括中国民主同盟在内的外国政治团体活动后，香港英政府立法局又于二十五日通过一项“社团法规”，禁止外国政党活动，此项法规之目的显然亦系针对在香港的中国民主党派而发。另香港英国当局已计划在后海湾沿岸地区平毁若干中国居民村庄，修筑飞机场。此事已引起当地居民强烈反对。
