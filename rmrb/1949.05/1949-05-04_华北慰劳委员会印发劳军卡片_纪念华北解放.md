    North China Comfort Committee Issues Army Appreciation Cards
    Commemorating the Liberation of North China
    [From Our Own Correspondent] The North China Comfort Committee has printed army appreciation cards to be presented to the soldiers at the front. The cards are exquisitely made, with two four-color offset prints on one side, titled "Commemorating the Liberation of North China" and "Eliminate All Enemies Who Dare to Resist." The other side contains messages from the North China People's Government, the North China Bureau, and the North China Military Region. It states: "You have swept away the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in North China, liberated famous cities such as Peiping and Tientsin, and transformed North China into a solid rear area for the national liberation war, performing great meritorious service for the people. We hope that you will use the power of the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin to cross the Yangtze River on a southern expedition, eliminate all enemies who dare to resist, liberate the whole country, and establish even greater merit. We will certainly support your advance with victories on the production front." These cards were very popular with the soldiers when they were distributed to the troops. The committee has also presented a batch of copper ink boxes, a special product of Peiping, to General Lin Biao and others as souvenirs of the liberation of Peiping.

    【本报讯】华北慰劳委员会印制慰劳卡片，赠送前线将士。卡片制作精美异常，一面有四色套版图画两幅，分别题有“华北解放纪念”与“消灭一切敢于抵抗之敌人”。另一面写华北人民政府，华北局及华北军区的赠言。上称：“你们扫清国民党反动派在华北的统治，解放全国著名的都市平津等地；把华北变成全国解放战争巩固的后方；为人民立下大功。尚望你们以解放平津等地的威力，渡江南征，消灭一切敢于抵抗的敌人；解放全国，建立更大功劳。我们一定以生产战线上的胜利，支援你们进军。”这种卡片，发至部队时，极受战士欢迎。该会顷又以北平特产之铜质墨盒一批，献给林彪将军等，以作为解放北平之纪念品。
