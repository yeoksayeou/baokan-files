Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 26th: The four private needle factories in Tianjin, which had completely shut down before the liberation, have now all resumed operation, with a monthly output of 250 crates (250,000 needles per crate). Qianxin Needle Factory received an order loan of 2.5 million yuan from the Bank of Communications, which solved the problem of capital turnover, and its output has been increasing month by month. The factory produced more than 40 crates of needles in March and increased to 67 crates in April. The output of Ruishengxiang, Tianjin, and Jifeng factories has also gradually increased. The factories are aware that the relationship between urban and rural areas is becoming smoother, and the sales of needles will gradually expand. They are adding more machines and expanding production.

　　津四家针厂复业
  　月产二百五十箱
    【新华社天津二十六日电】津市解放前完全停顿的四家私营制针厂，现已全部复工，月产达二百五十箱（每箱二十五万颗）。谦信针厂因得到交通银行二百五十万元的定货贷款，解决了资金周转的困难，产量逐月增加。该厂三月份产针四十余箱，四月份增至六十七箱。瑞生祥、天津、冀丰三厂产量亦逐渐增加。各厂鉴于城乡关系日益畅通，针的销路将逐渐扩展，正在增装机器，扩大生产。
