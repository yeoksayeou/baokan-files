Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st—Lu Cheng, the first chairman of the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions, and Ye Miaoxiu, a member of the Central Executive Bureau of the same association, who were previously deported by the British authorities in Malaya and traveled to Beiping, were extremely indignant upon learning that S.A. Ganapathy, chairman of the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions, was hanged by the British colonial authorities in Malaya on the 4th of this month. They issued a statement today protesting this brutal atrocity by the British authorities in Malaya. The original text is as follows:

　　On May 4th, the British imperialist authorities in Malaya brutally executed S.A. Ganapathy, an outstanding representative of the Malayan people and a leader of the Malayan workers—chairman of the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions. The barbaric face of the British imperialists has once again been exposed to the people of the world. Since June of last year, according to incomplete statistics, more than 15,000 innocent Malayans have been arrested, imprisoned, tortured, deported, and murdered by the British imperialists. The Malayan British authorities' hanging of Comrade Ganapathy this time was merely because he was dissatisfied with the British authorities' unreasonable persecution of the Malayan people, and solely because Comrade Ganapathy was loyal to the Malayan people's desire for freedom and democracy. We hereby lodge a serious protest against the Malayan British authorities' brutal killing of Ganapathy.

　　We believe that the consistent brutal behavior of the British imperialists in Malaya is intolerable to anyone who demands national liberation, democracy, and freedom. We hereby extend our deepest condolences to all the working-class brothers and all anti-imperialist people who have suffered in Malaya. We firmly believe that the inhumane and shameful crimes of the British imperialists do not represent their strength, but rather their frantic struggles on the eve of their demise. The development of the Malayan people's guerrilla war currently marks the combination of the revolutionary forces of the Chinese proletariat and the revolutionary forces of the Malayan peasants. The execution of Comrade Ganapathy, the revered leader of the broad masses of Indian workers in the cities, railways, and rubber plantations, precisely demonstrates the upsurge of the revolutionary sentiment of the Indian working class. This undoubtedly shakes the British imperialists' strategic urban base, which they use to attack the rural revolutionary armed forces. It is precisely because of this that British imperialism has replaced its daily boasted "democracy" and "freedom" with a bloody noose.

　　We are a group of workers who once nourished the land of Malaya with blood and sweat, we were once the creators of Malayan wealth, and we have always coexisted with the Malayan people. Therefore, in addition to lodging a serious protest against the British imperialists' hanging of Comrade Ganapathy, we solemnly tell you—British imperialists: The noose hardened by the blood of Comrade Ganapathy is the best hammer to strike your death knell! The working people of the whole world will not forgive your heinous crimes!

　　在平马来亚职工领袖声明
  　全世界人民不会宽恕英帝罪行
    【新华社北平二十一日电】前被马来亚英当局驱逐出境辗转来平的全马来亚职工联合总会第一届主席卢成与该会中央执行局委员叶淼秀，获悉全马来亚职工联合会主席加纳帕西于本月四日被马来亚英国殖民当局绞杀的消息后，愤慨万分，特于今日发表声明，抗议马来亚英当局这一凶残的暴行，原文如下：
    马来亚英帝国主义当局于五月四日，以残暴的绞刑杀害马来亚人民的优秀代表，马来亚工人领袖—全马来亚职工联合会主席Ｓ·Ａ·加纳帕西·英帝国主义者的野蛮面目，又一次暴露于世界人民面前。自去年六月以来，被英帝国主义者逮捕、监禁、毒刑拷打、驱逐出境及杀害的马来亚无辜民众，据不完全统计，已有一万五千人以上。这次马来亚英当局绞杀加纳帕西同志，仅仅是因为他不满于英当局对马来亚人民的无理迫害，仅仅由于加纳帕西同志矢忠于马来亚人民自由民主的意愿。我们特对马来亚英当局残暴地杀害加纳帕西的事件提出严重的抗议。
    我们认为英帝国主义者在马来亚一贯的残暴行为，是任何要求民族解放、民主自由的人们所不能容忍的。我们谨在此向马来亚一切被难的工人阶级兄弟和全体反帝国主义的人民致以深切的慰问之意。我们深信英帝国主义者这种惨无人道的可耻罪行，并不是代表它力量的强大，恰表示它临死前夜的疯狂挣扎。目前马来亚人民游击战争的开展，正标志着华籍无产阶级的革命力量与马来亚农民的革命力量的结合。而在城市、铁路、胶园里的广大印度籍工人群众的崇爱领袖—加纳帕西同志之被处死，正说明了印籍工人阶级革命情绪的高涨。这无疑是震撼了英帝国主义者用以进攻乡村革命武装的城市战略根据地的。也就因为如此，英帝国主义就以血腥的绞索来代替其日常自夸的所谓“民主”和“自由”了。
    我们是曾以血汗滋养马来亚土地的工人的一群，我们曾是马来亚财富的创造者，我们一向是和马来亚人民共生存的。因此，我们除向英帝国主义绞死加纳帕西同志一事，提出严重的抗议外，我们严正的告诉你们—英帝国主义者：为加纳帕西同志的血所凝染而变硬了的绞索，正是敲击你没落丧钟最好的锤子！全世界的劳动人民是不会宽恕你这一滔天的罪行的！
