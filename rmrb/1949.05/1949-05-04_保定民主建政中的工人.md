　　【Report from Central Hebei】Workers in Baoding City demonstrated the leading role of the working class and the power of uniting the broad masses of the people in the democratic governance. In this democratic governance movement in Baoding City, 281 workers were elected as 正/副 (zhèng/fù) heads of the "Lü" (闾 - neighborhood), and 1,161 workers were elected as 正/副 (zhèng/fù) heads of the residents' groups. During the elections, workers launched a struggle against the deeply sinful puppet Baojia personnel, exposing the crimes of the puppet Baojia system and its sabotage activities against the democratic elections. Gao Qingshan and Chen Erdan, workers from the porter business on Cuanshang Village's Jiaohang Street in the Fourth District, took the lead in enlightening and organizing more than 140 villagers to reason with Wang Shouchun, a representative of the sinful puppet Bao head, exposing his crimes of conscripting soldiers and laborers for the enemy, extorting money, embezzlement, and seizing land, which enlightened the citizens and isolated the bad elements. Tang Caifeng, the Jia head of the enemy in the 32nd Street of the Second District, colluded to deceive residents into electing him as group leader during the democratic governance work. The workers immediately reported to the street government and also held a meeting of the residents' group to expose Tang Caifeng's reactionary behavior. Everyone demanded that the government revoke his civil rights. The workers also actively publicized the significance of democratic governance and mobilized citizens to participate in the elections. Huo Quanxiang, a porter worker from the 50th Street of the Fourth District, took time out in the morning and evening to help the street government go deep into each household to publicize the election methods and the conditions for being elected. He often didn't get home to eat until twelve o'clock at night. Huo Quanxiang always recited to his fellow workers: Now we have the right to vote, we must elect people who are of one heart with us. During the election, in the 38th Street of the Third District, out of more than 130 voters in the third "Lü" (闾 - neighborhood), 69 votes elected Zhao Yongchun, a craftsman worker, as the head of the "Lü" (闾 - neighborhood). The workers who were elected as "Lü" (闾 - neighborhood) and group leaders all swore to serve the people. Railway worker Li Shun said: "The Kuomintang was dark here; the Communist Party brought light. Now that I am the head of the 'Lü' (闾 - neighborhood), we will jointly protect this light. From now on, I will definitely act according to the path pointed out by the Communist Party and the opinions of everyone."
    The workers' support from the citizens, especially the poor and working citizens, in the election was due to their increased class consciousness under the leadership of the Communist Party and their demonstration of the vanguard role of the proletariat in various tasks. They enthusiastically led everyone to organize production. For example, Huo Quanxiang responded to the call of the People's Government and, under the leadership of the street cadres, organized fifteen hard-working citizens in the street to contract to demolish dilapidated buildings and also organized twelve people to boil saltpeter; and actively helped to establish a porter workers' union of more than forty people. For example, Cao Anze, a spinning mill worker from the 20th Street, was very concerned about the workers' studies and organized a people's school, which grew to more than 60 students in less than a month. This spirit of caring for class brothers greatly increased the workers' prestige among the citizens and also won everyone's support.

　　保定民主建政中的工人
    【冀中电】保定市工人在民主建政中，表现了工人阶级的领导作用和团结广大人民的力量。保定市在此次民主建政运动中，计有工人二百八十一名，当选了正副闾主任；工人一千一百六十一名，当选了正副居民小组长。在选举中，工人对罪恶深重的伪保甲人员，展开了斗争，揭露了伪保甲制度的罪恶和其对民主选举的破坏活动。四区四十九街窜上村脚行工人高青山和陈二旦等，带头启发组织了一百四十多个村民向罪恶的伪保长代表王寿春说理，揭发了他给敌人抓兵、抓夫、敲诈、贪污、霸占土地的罪恶事实，启发了市民的觉悟，孤立了坏分子。二区三十二街敌人的甲长唐才峰在民主建政工作中，曾串通欺骗居民选举他当组长，工人们立即报告街政府，还召开居民小组会议，揭发唐才峰的反动行为。大家要求政府，取消他的公民权利。工人们还积极宣传了民主建政的意义，发动市民参加选举。四区五十街脚行工人霍全相，早晚抽出空来帮助街政府深入到各户宣传选举的办法和当选人的条件。常常到晚上十二点才回家吃饭。霍全相总是给工友们念道：现在咱们有了选举的权利，一定要选举和咱们一条心的人。在选举时，三区三十八街，第三闾一百三十多选民，有六十九票选了手艺工人赵永春当闾主任。当选了闾组长的工人，都宣誓要为人民服务。铁路工人李顺说：“国民党在这里黑暗；共产党来了光明，我当了闾主任，咱就一块保住咱们这光明，以后我一定按共产党指的道路和大家的意见办事。”
    在选举中，工人得到市民特别是贫苦劳动市民的拥护，是因他们在共产党领导下提高了阶级觉悟，在各种工作中表现了无产阶级的先锋作用，他们热心的带动大家组织生产。比如霍全相响应人民政府的号召，在街干部的领导下，组织本街劳苦市民十五人，包工拆破楼，还组织了十二个人熬硝；并积极帮助成立了四十多人的脚行工会。如二十街的纺纱厂工人曹安泽，很关心工人的学习，组织民校，不到一个月就发展到六十多名学员。他们这种关心阶级弟兄的精神，大大提高了工人在市民中的威信，同时也得到大家的拥护。
