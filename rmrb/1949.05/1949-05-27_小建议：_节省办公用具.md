　　Small Suggestion:
    Saving Office Supplies
    After starting work in large cities, some comrades have a lot of unnecessary waste in office stationery and paper public property. In our department, the monthly office expenses are always exceeded. The reason is that they use a sheet of paper even for writing a few words, and they use good paper for drafts. Some people also see others receiving new things, but their old ones are not used up, so they also go to get a copy. Public bicycles are crashed randomly, and when they are broken, they ask the public to repair them. The lights and tap water are not turned off after use. These are just a few examples. There are many other such situations. Education should be strengthened in every agency to eliminate it.

　　小建议：
    节省办公用具
    进入大城市工作后，有些同志在办公文具及纸张公物上有很多不必要的浪费。在我们这个部门，每月的办公费都是超过的。原因是写几个字也用一张纸，打草稿也用好纸。还有一些人看到别人领来新东西，但自己的旧的还没用完，也去领一份，公家自行车随便乱撞，坏了找公家修。电灯自来水使用后不给关。这只是一些小例子。其他还有很多这种情形。应在每一个机关里加强教育，消灭它。
