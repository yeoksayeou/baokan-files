    [Chahar News] To overcome the masses' wait-for-rain mentality and seize the time for spring planting, the Yishui District Committee formed a production inspection team of 23 district-level Party, government, and people's organization cadres, led by District Committee Secretary Du Cunxun and Propaganda Minister Li Shoushan, to inspect and organize production work in Yi, Man, Xu, Ding, Wan, Tang, and Wang counties from April 20th. Their main tasks are: (1) To organize the masses to sow and plant, overcoming the wait-for-rain mentality. (2) To vigorously develop water conservancy: organize the masses to dig wells, repair wells, purchase waterwheels, repair waterwheels, and open canals. (3) To conscientiously organize the masses to eliminate uncultivated land. The main methods for achieving the above tasks are: (1) To strengthen the lower-level organizations, especially the village-level organizations. The village branch should become the core of leading production, strengthening the leadership role of the village representative meetings and production committees. The county and district should select one or two key villages to drive nearby villages, and organize joint village inspection teams to achieve mutual inspection and observation. (2) Leadership should focus on large organizational work, such as canals and post-rain sowing, grasping typical examples for research and promotion. (3) Widely organize women to participate in agricultural production. (4) Organize the production of families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and cadres, overcoming the meritorious service mentality and reliance mentality of some households. At the same time, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the work of substitute farming. (Chen Yongjun)
    [Taihang News] In order to further promote the spring ploughing and sowing movement, the Huguan County Committee decided that, in addition to continuing to station county committee members in various districts to personally grasp and guide, it would also draw cadres from various agencies to form a county committee inspection team, delving into villages, households, and fields to conduct on-the-spot inspections, create experience, and promote the great production movement. The inspection team of twelve people formed three groups and went to the countryside on the 25th to conduct key inspections. The main content includes: To what extent has deep plowing and meticulous cultivation been achieved? Has the application of 10 to 15 dan of fertilizer per mu been achieved? Has the labor shortage been resolved, and how? Have women been mobilized? Are there any pests, and have preventive measures been taken? How much livestock has been bred and purchased? Each district inspects three typical villages (good, bad, and average). If problems are discovered, find ways to solve them. The inspection must not affect the production time of the masses, and must be conducted by delving into the homes and fields of the peasants for practical inspection. (Liang Yu)
