    [Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, Nanjing, 30th] The Nanjing Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on the 28th, stipulating that from now on, all grain tax payments, public and private income and expenditure, price calculations, accounts, notes, contracts, etc., must use the legal currency, namely the Renminbi issued by the People's Bank of China, as the calculation and settlement standard. Counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates are illegal currency from now on. However, in order to take care of the people's difficulties, they are temporarily allowed to circulate in the market before May 8th, and their use will be strictly prohibited after the deadline. The proclamation also stipulates that one Renminbi is equivalent to 2,500 counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates as the initial exchange rate. However, due to the continued devaluation of the counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates, the people can change the exchange rate at any time according to its devaluation during the temporary circulation period. The People's Bank of China will post and announce the changes in the exchange rate between Renminbi and counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates at any time. In order to take care of the people's difficulties, the People's Bank of China will announce measures to preferentially redeem a portion of the counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates.
