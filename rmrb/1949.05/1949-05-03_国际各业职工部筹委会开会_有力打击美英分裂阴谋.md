Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, May 3rd Dispatch: TASS News Agency reports: According to the decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee, the various provisional preparatory committees responsible for forming the international trade departments held a meeting in Paris in early April. Attendees included representatives from the French metal, textile, leather, mining, and food industries; representatives from the Soviet machine manufacturing, textile, shoe, and mining industries; representatives from the Italian hardware, textile, leather, and food industries; representatives from the Dutch hardware industry; representatives from the Romanian textile industry; representatives from the Czech machine manufacturing industry; and representatives from the American and Canadian fur and leather industries. Representatives from the American food and tobacco industry attended as observers. Several representatives from the Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Polish trade unions were unable to attend the meeting because France refused to issue them entry visas. However, this will not prevent these trade unions from participating in the international trade departments. The meeting decided on the date for the inaugural assembly and passed a notice to relevant trade unions and industry workers. It is reported that the provisional plan drafted by the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions stipulates that trade departments should first be organized for five industries: hardware and machine manufacturing, textile and clothing, shoe, leather and fur, mining, and food. This action by the World Federation of Trade Unions has dealt a powerful blow to the conspiracy of the upper-level leaders of the American and British trade unions to split the World Federation of Trade Unions for more than three years, and will help to encourage the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, enabling it to more powerfully and concretely safeguard the interests of workers.
