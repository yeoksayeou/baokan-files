  　Large-Scale Construction of Sports Grounds
  　Expansion of Nurseries During Busy Farming Seasons
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th] Moscow Dispatch: Collective farms across the Soviet Union are undertaking large-scale construction of new gymnasiums, sports grounds, and children's playgrounds, and are preparing to open nurseries for the busy farming season. Collective farmers in the Vinnytsia Oblast of the Ukrainian Republic have built 37 gymnasiums and 1,166 sports grounds in a very short time. Collective farmers of the Borets Collective Farm in the Moscow Oblast have also begun to build gymnasiums and sports grounds, and they have allocated funds from the collective farm's fund to purchase bicycles, motorcycles, gymnastics equipment, and other sports equipment. Now, collective farmers and athletes in various republics and oblasts across the Soviet Union are organizing voluntary Sunday labor to raise funds and accelerate the construction of gymnasiums and sports grounds. Collective farms in various places have also designated locations for children's playgrounds and planted fruit trees.
    The busy farming season is about to begin. In order to enable the female collective farmers to fully participate in labor, all collective farms in the Soviet Union are actively preparing to open nurseries for the busy farming season. This year, the scale of these nurseries will be greatly expanded. In the Russian Federal Republic alone, two million children will be able to enter these nurseries during the busy farming season. The nurseries will be located in the best houses of the collective farms and managed by trained female childcare workers. The collective farms will provide the best food for the children. Health departments will also send many pediatricians and nurses to regularly take care of the children's health.
