　　Three Thousand Four Hundred New and Old Cases
  　Rapidly and Properly Resolved
  　Tianjin People Praise the People's Court
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Courts of Tianjin and Beijing faithfully serve the people. Since liberation, they have concluded more than three thousand four hundred cases. In the past, the people suffered from disputes caused by the exploitation, deception, extortion, and assassination perpetrated by Kuomintang bandits and other unreasonable and nefarious systems. Today, they can finally appeal to their own government and courts for resolution. From the day the Tianjin People's Court began its work in the city, citizens submitted cases to the court every day, piling up to over a foot in height. From January to the end of April, the court resolved cases through judgments, conciliation, withdrawals, transfers of jurisdiction, and suspensions. The cases concluded included 116 cases of property rights, 211 cases of housing disputes, 454 cases of debts, 290 cases of marriage and personal matters, 8 cases of inheritance, 1 case of labor-capital disputes, and 97 other cases. Criminal cases included various types such as murder, injury, opium, disruption of finance, offenses against public morals, obstruction of freedom, robbery, theft, fraud, embezzlement, corruption, marriage-related crimes, gambling, collaboration with the enemy, abandonment, and destruction. Through judgments of guilt, innocence, fines, suspended sentences, minor revocations, transfers of jurisdiction, and educational releases, a total of 1,525 criminal cases were concluded. The total number of civil and criminal cases was over 2,700. Because the People's Government courts have resolved citizens' current and past problems in a timely, rapid, and reasonable manner – problems that had not been resolved for the past ten or twenty years – the citizens praise the People's Court as "clear skies." In Beijing, more than fifty to one hundred people request the People's Court to handle their problems every day. Since taking over the pseudo-courts, the court staff has been working extremely hard day and night to handle cases, and they have now concluded 735 civil and criminal cases. The people of Beijing admire the court's earnest and meticulous spirit. In particular, those who cannot write legal documents for oral litigation feel that the People's Court is truly thinking of them everywhere and is a court of the people.

　　三千四百新旧案件
  　迅速获得妥善解决
  　平津人民赞誉人民法院
    【本报讯】平津人民法院忠诚为人民服务，解放后已结案三千四百余件。过去人民由于国民党匪徒的压榨、欺骗、勒索、暗杀等不合理的恶劣制度所引起的纠纷，今日始得向自己的政府、法院申诉解决。天津人民法院从开始入城办公之日起，市民每日送往法院的案件厚达尺余，从一月份到四月底，用判决、和解、撤回、转移管辖、休止等方式，已结的案件有物权一百一十六件，房屋纠纷二百一十一件，债务四百五十四件，婚姻人事二百九十件，继承八件、劳资一件，其他九十七件。刑事案包括杀人、伤害、烟毒、扰乱金融、妨害风化，妨害自由、强盗、窃盗、诈欺、侵占、贪污、婚姻、赌博、汉奸、遗弃、破坏等多种，经判决有罪、无罪、罚金、缓刑，或轻微撤销、转移管辖、教育释放等共结案一千五百二十五件。民事、刑事两项共二千七百余件。由于人民政府法院及时、迅速、合理地解决了市民现在的以至过去十年二十年前所未获解决的问题，市民誉人民法院为“青天”。在北平市每日有五十到一百余人请求人民法院处理自己的问题。自接管伪法院后，法院工作人员极其紧张的昼夜处理案件，现已结民事、刑事案件七百三十五件。平市人民对法院认真，细心的精神极为敬佩，特别是不能写诉讼书之口头诉讼者，更感到人民法院处处真为自己着想，是人民的法院。
