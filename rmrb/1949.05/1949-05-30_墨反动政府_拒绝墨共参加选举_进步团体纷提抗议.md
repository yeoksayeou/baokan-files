　　Reactionary Mexican Government
  　Refuses to Allow Mexican Communist Party to Participate in Elections
    Progressive Groups File Protests
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th] TASS reports: Mexican progressive groups and individuals are widely opposing the government's refusal to allow the Mexican Communist Party to participate in the June 3rd Congressional elections. Since the reactionaries in that country, in order to rig the elections, refused to register the Mexican Communist Party as a national political party, thereby preventing the party from participating in the elections, the Confederation of Workers of Mexico (CTM), the United Workers and Farmers Confederation, the National Federation of Students, the Mexican Democratic Youth Federation, the Chairman of the People's Party, Toledano (Chairman of the Latin American Workers' Confederation), the artist Orozco, and the writer Revueltas, among others, have successively issued statements demanding that the government revoke this reactionary measure.

    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社讯：墨西哥进步团体与个人纷纷反对政府拒绝墨共参加六月三日的国会竞选。自该国反动派为包办选举，拒绝墨共登记为全国性政党，藉使该党不能参加竞选后，劳工联合会、工人与农民联合会、全国学生联合会、墨西哥民主青年联合会、人民党主席托列达诺（拉丁美洲劳工联合会主席）、艺术家欧罗兹科及作家瑞渥尔塔斯等等，都先后发表声明，要求政府撤销此项反动措施。
