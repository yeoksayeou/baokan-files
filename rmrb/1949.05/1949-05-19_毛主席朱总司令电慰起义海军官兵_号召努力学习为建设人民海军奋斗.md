Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today sent a telegram to congratulate General Lin Zun, commander of the former Kuomintang Second Naval Defense Fleet, and all the officers and soldiers under his command who had revolted. The telegram reads:

General Lin Zun, Captain Shao Lun, Captain Li Baoying, Captain Wu Jian'an, Captain Zhang Jiabao, Captain Song Jihong, Captain Yi Yuanfang, Captain Guo Bingheng, Captain Han Tingfeng, Captain Chen Wudu, Captain Du Cheng Shen, Captain Zhang Ru＠①, and all the officers and soldiers of the Second Fleet:

Congratulations on your heroic act on the Nanjing river. You led twenty-five ships and resolutely broke away from the reactionary camp to join the big family of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This is an action worthy of warm welcome from the people of the whole country. After the cruiser Chongqing revolted in February and was bombed and destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in March, you staged a large-scale uprising in April. This shows that the great will of the patriotic Chinese people to build their own navy and coastal defense cannot be stopped by any reactionary remnants. We hope that you will unite as one, learn the ideas and working system of the People's Liberation Army for building the army, and continue to learn naval technology, and strive for the bright future of the Chinese People's Navy!

　　Mao Zedong Zhu De

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: Nanjing News: The officers and soldiers of the Second Naval Defense Fleet of the Kuomintang, who revolted on the Jiangmian River in Badou Mountain, northeast of Nanjing, on the 23rd of last month, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 30th of last month to pay their respects. The telegram is as follows: Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people and Chairman of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission: Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

As we begin to enter the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation, please accept our most sincere and sublime respect.

We are a group of naval officers and soldiers ruled by the Kuomintang reactionary government. The reactionary government once ordered us to use the weapons exchanged for the blood and sweat of the people to massacre the people who were striving for national independence, democracy, and freedom, and to protect the Chiang family's small dynasty, which was selling out the country, engaging in dictatorship, civil war, and anti-people activities. However, we often think that the navy established with the blood and sweat of the people should be used to defend national independence and people's democracy. Why should we use the weapons supplied by American imperialism to slaughter our own compatriots and engage in anti-people wars? We doubted, thought, were angry and indignant, and thought that one day we would find a possible opportunity to return to the people's front and stand with the people.

The day we were looking forward to finally arrived. When the million-strong army of the People's Liberation Army victoriously broke through the Yangtze River and the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government fled, the ships of our fleet were concentrated under Badou Mountain in the northeast of Nanjing. On the 23rd, we raised the banner of righteousness at Yanzi Rock and joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Kuomintang reactionaries, who were incorrigible and opposed to the people, continued to send air force to bomb us in turn after our uprising, vainly attempting to prevent the Chinese people from building their own navy. This further exposed the ugly face of the Kuomintang's opposition to China's independence and democracy, further aroused our anger, and further strengthened our will to fight for the cause of people's liberation. In the future, we vow to implement Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, to thoroughly overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule supported by American imperialism, to complete the new democratic revolution, to thoroughly transform ourselves, to learn Chairman Mao's principles, ideology, and style of building a people's army, to learn all the excellent political work and command work systems of the People's Liberation Army, and to build a people's navy!

Lin Zun, Commander of the Second Fleet and Rear Admiral, Shao Lun, Captain of the Yong Sui Warship, Li Baoying, Captain of the Chu Tong Warship, Wu Jian'an, Captain of the Hui'an Warship, Zhang Jiabao, Captain of the Jiang Xi Warship, Song Jihong, Captain of the Ji'an Warship, Yi Yuanfang, Captain of the Mei Sheng Warship, Guo Bingheng, Captain of the Lian Guang Warship, Han Tingfeng, Captain of the An Dong Warship, Chen Wudu, Captain of the Taiyuan Warship, Du Cheng Shen, Captain of the Fifth Patrol Boat Squadron, Zhang Ru＠ Captain of the First Motorboat Squadron, and all the officers and soldiers bow down together. April 30th

　　毛主席朱总司令电慰起义海军官兵
    号召努力学习为建设人民海军奋斗
    【新华社北平十八日电】中国人民革命军事委员会毛泽东主席和中国人民解放军朱德总司令本日电贺起义的前国民党海防第二舰队司令林遵将军及所率全体官兵。电文称：
    林遵将军、邵仑舰长，李宝英舰长、吴建安舰长，张家宝舰长、宋继宏舰长、易元方舰长、郭秉衡舰长、韩廷枫舰长，陈务笃舰长，杜澄深队长、张汝＠①队长和第二舰队的全体员兵们：
    庆祝你们在南京江面上的壮举。你们率领二十五艘舰艇，毅然脱离反动阵营，参加到中国人民解放军的大家庭来，这是值得全国人民热烈欢迎的行动。在巡洋舰重庆号于二月间起义并被国民党反动派于三月间炸毁以后，四月间又有你们的大规模起义，可见中国爱国人民建设自己的海军和海防的伟大意志，不是任何反动残余所能阻止的。希望你们团结一致，学习人民解放军的建军思想和工作制度，并继续学习海军技术，为中国人民海军的光明前途而奋斗！

  　一九四九年五月十八日
    【新华社北平十八日电】南京讯：上月二十三日在南京东北笆斗山江面上起义的国民党海防第二舰队全体官兵于上月三十日电中共中央毛主席，中国人民解放军朱总司令致敬。电文如下：中国人民革命军事委员会主席中国人民领袖毛主席：中国人民解放军朱总司令：
    当我们开始走进中国人民解放行列之际，请接受我们最诚挚崇高的敬意。
    我们是一群被国民党反动政府统治着的海军。反动政府曾指挥我们以人民血汗换来的武器，来屠杀争取民族独立民主自由的人民，保护卖国独裁内战反人民的蒋家小朝廷。可是，我们时常想到，用人民血汗建立起来的海军，应该是用来捍卫国家独立与人民民主的，为什么要拿美帝国主义供给的武器，屠杀自己同胞，从事反人民的战争？我们怀疑、思虑、愤怒不平，想到有一天总会找到可能的机会回到人民的阵线，和人民站在一起。
    这个期待的日子终于来到了。当人民解放军百万雄师胜利突破了长江，南京国民党反动政府逃窜的时候，我们舰队的舰艇集中在南京东北笆斗山下，二十三日在燕子矶高举义旗，参加了中国人民解放军。
    怙恶不悛与人民为敌的国民党反动派，竟于我们起义后，不断驱使空军轮番轰炸，妄想阻止中国人民建立自己的海军。这更加暴露了国民党反对中国独立民主的狰狞面目，更激起了我们的愤怒，更坚定了我们为人民解放事业而奋斗的意志。今后誓愿在中国共产党与人民革命军事委员会和人民解放军华东军区领导之下，贯彻毛主席、朱总司令进军命令，为彻底推翻在美帝国主义支持下的国民党反动统治，完成新民主主义革命而奋斗；为彻底改造自己，学习毛主席建设人民军队的原则思想作风、学习人民解放军一切优良的政治工作与指挥工作的制度、建立一支人民的海军而奋斗！
    第二舰队少将司令林遵、永绥军舰舰长邵仑、楚同军舰舰长李宝英、惠安军舰舰长吴建安、江犀军舰舰长张家宝、吉安军舰舰长宋继宏、美盛军舰舰长易元方、联光军舰舰长郭秉衡、安东军舰舰长韩廷枫、太原军舰舰长陈务笃、第五巡防艇队队长杜澄深、第一机动艇队队长张汝＠暨全体员兵同叩。四月三十日
