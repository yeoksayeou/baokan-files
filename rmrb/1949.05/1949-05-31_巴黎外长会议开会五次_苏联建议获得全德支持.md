　　Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference Meets Five Times
  　Soviet Proposal Receives Pan-German Support
    The sixth session of the Soviet-American-British-French Foreign Ministers' Conference opened in Paris on the 23rd. As of the 27th, five meetings have been held. The four foreign ministers have adopted the agenda for the conference. At the first day's meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky proposed that a foreign ministers' conference be convened with the participation of China within a set time frame to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. The conference chairman, Schuman, suggested that this issue be reserved for discussion at a future session of this conference. The foreign ministers' meetings in the past few days have discussed the issue of German unification. On this issue, the Soviet side put forward positive and constructive opinions at the beginning of the discussion. The Soviet proposal included: (1) Resuming the activities of the Allied Control Council in Germany as the body responsible for exercising supreme authority in Germany; (2) Establishing an all-German Council of State based on the existing economic institutions in the eastern and western occupation zones, responsible for dealing with economic and national development issues of all-German importance. However, this legitimate Soviet proposal was rejected by the American, British, and French representatives, either explicitly or implicitly. They were unwilling to restore the "Allied Control Council, which can only take decisions based on unanimous agreement"; they insisted that the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German Council of State was a "step backward"; they were unwilling to discuss the issue of German unification comprehensively, but only wanted to discuss economic issues first, and according to Acheson's interpretation of these issues, it amounted to merging the Soviet occupation zone into the western occupation zones. The stance of the American, British, and French representatives proves that they are continuing to pursue a policy of splitting Germany. This policy is being actively pursued outside the conference as well. On the same day the Paris Conference opened (May 23rd), the United States, Britain, and France incited their German puppets to announce in Bonn the entry into force of the West German "constitution" that splits Germany. This policy of the American, British, and French authorities is not only opposed by the Soviet representatives at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but also by the German people. The entire German people continue to issue strong calls for unification and a just peace; West German Communist Party representatives strongly condemned the Bonn "constitution," saying it was nothing more than a German-language directive for implementing occupation regulations; the broad masses of people in Dusseldorf held a rally in front of the state parliament, demanding the rejection of this "constitution."
    The Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia solemnly opened on the 25th. Representatives of fraternal parties from twenty-nine countries participated in this grand event. One of the main items on the agenda of the Czech Communist Party Congress is to discuss the five-year plan for the reconstruction and development of the Czechoslovak national economy, which stipulates the great development of heavy industry and the improvement of the economic welfare and culture of the working people. On the first day of the Congress, Czech Communist Party Chairman Gottwald delivered a report on the party's activities over the past three years and future tasks. On the second and third days, Czech Communist Party General Secretary Slansky delivered a report on the organizational tasks facing the party in implementing the five-year plan, and Czech Prime Minister Zapotocky delivered a report on the five-year plan for the reconstruction and development of the national economy. Before the opening of the Congress, factories, mines, and institutions launched competitions to celebrate the convening of the Congress.

　　巴黎外长会议开会五次
  　苏联建议获得全德支持
    第六届苏美英法外长会议已于二十三日在巴黎开幕，迄二十七日为止，已开会五次。四国外长已通过会议的议程。苏外长维辛斯基在第一日会议上提出规定时间在中国参加之下，召开外长会议讨论对日和约问题的建议，会议主席舒曼建议这一问题留交本届会议某一次会上予以讨论。过去几天的外长会议是讨论德国统一问题。关于这一问题，苏联方面在讨论开始时就提出了积极的有建设性的意见。苏联建议：（一）恢复德境盟国管制委员会的活动，作为在德国负责执行最高权力的机构；（二）以东西占领区现有的经济机构为基础，建立全德的国务会议，负责处理具有全德重要性的经济与国家发展的问题。可是，苏联这一正当的建议，却被美英法代表或明或暗地加以拒绝。他们不愿意恢复“须以一致协议为基础方能采取决定的盟国管制委员会”；他们硬说苏联成立全德国务会议的建议是“倒退一步”；他们不愿全盘讨论德国统一问题，只愿首先讨论经济问题，而按照艾奇逊关于这些问题的解释，归结起来就是将苏联占领区并入西方占领区。美英法代表的这种立场，证明他们继续采取着分裂德国的政策。这种政策并正在会议之外积极推行着。就在巴黎会议开幕的同日（二十三日），美、英、法竟嗾使他们的德国傀儡，在波恩宣布分裂德国的西德“宪法”生效。美、英、法当局的这种政策，不仅在外长会议上受到苏联代表的反对，而且也受到德国人民的反对。全德人民继续发出要求统一及公正和平的强有力的呼声；西德共产党代表严斥波恩“宪法”，说它不过是实施占领法规的德文训令；杜塞尔多夫的广大人民在州议会之前举行集会，要求否决这个“宪法”。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党第九届代表大会已于二十五日隆重揭幕。二十九国兄弟党的代表参与此一盛会。捷共代表大会主要议程之一，是讨论重建与发展捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的五年计划，该计划规定重工业的巨大发展和劳动人民经济福利与文化的提高。大会第一日，捷共主席哥特瓦尔德作了三年以来党的活动和今后任务的报告。第二、第三日，捷共总书记斯兰斯基作了党在执行五年计划时期所面临的组织任务的报告，捷总理萨波托斯基作了重建与发展国民经济五年计划的报告。大会开幕之前，工厂、矿山和机关都发动了竞赛，以庆祝大会的召开。
