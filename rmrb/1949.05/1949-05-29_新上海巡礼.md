　　A Tour of New Shanghai
　　Lin Lin, Wen Guohua
　　The six million citizens of Shanghai, who had endured countless years of hardship under the Kuomintang reactionaries' evil rule, have been able to hold their heads high since May 25th. Time flies! When the citizens opened their sleepy eyes on the morning of the 25th, Shanghai had already taken on a new look. As the long lines of the People's Liberation Army marched past, citizens on both sides of the road excitedly crossed the road to celebrate the liberation with each other.

　　On the afternoon of the 25th, more than ten thousand workers from districts such as Longhua, Xujiahui, Changshu, Lujiawan, Songshan, Penglai, Yimiao, as well as the Public Transportation, French Tram Company, and British Tram Company, turned out to form people's security teams and propaganda teams. Columns of students from Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Fudan University, Jinan University, and the Academy of Fine Arts appeared on the streets at noon, posting slogans, hanging cartoons, performing Yangko dances, and presenting flowers to the People's Liberation Army. One slogan read: "Our days have come!" The Academy of Fine Arts painted a giant portrait of Chairman Mao as tall as a house, which the students carried and hung in front of the Great World amusement center amidst cheering and the sound of gongs and drums.

　　On the second day of liberation, the 26th, red flags fluttered in the streets and alleys. Buses and trams were also decorated colorfully and resumed running on Avenue Joffre. A propaganda team composed of the China Vocational School and other organizations sang happily in the streets despite the rain. One of the songs went: "Spring has come, a hundred flowers bloom, the reactionary government has fallen. Summer has come, lotus flowers bloom, the People's Army has arrived in Shanghai." In the afternoon, although the rain was getting heavier and heavier, propaganda vehicles and propaganda teams continued to shuttle back and forth through the streets, with gongs and drums resounding. In front of the International Hotel building on Nanjing Road East, more than twenty military vehicles of the Kuomintang's 12th Army were neatly arranged, piled high with cotton-padded clothes and quilts. A People's Liberation Army soldier guarding these vehicles said humorously: "The Kuomintang is really efficient, preparing cotton-padded clothes and quilts for the People's Liberation Army in the summer." Next to these vehicles were two brand-new anti-tank guns towed by trucks, obviously abandoned in a panic by the Kuomintang bandit troops who had no time to pull them away.

　　Although the bandit troops east of the waterworks bridge and north of the Suzhou Creek were still shooting from time to time, many citizens, encouraged by the victory, followed the People's Liberation Army to the banks of the Suzhou Creek to watch the People's Liberation Army eliminate these remaining enemies. There was still sporadic fighting near the Garden Bridge, but wooden boats and motorboats were already shuttling back and forth across the river surface in the Nanshi area.

　　"Swear to defend Greater Shanghai to the death" was one of the slogans of the Kuomintang bandit gang's so-called "celebration of the victory in defending Greater Shanghai" on the afternoon of May 24th, but it was precisely that night that war criminals Tang Enbo, Chen Daqing, and others fled by plane, and the People's Liberation Army also entered the urban area of Shanghai that night. This lie of the Kuomintang bandit gang has now become a laughingstock for the people of Shanghai. [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th]

　　新上海巡礼
    林麟　温国华
    在国民党反动派罪恶统治下熬过了多少辛酸的岁月的上海六百万市民，从五月二十五日起扬眉吐气了。说来真快，当二十五日清晨，市民们睁开惺忪的睡眼时，上海已换了新的面貌。当漫长的解放军行列开过时，马路两侧的市民都兴奋地横隔马路互庆解放。
    二十五日当天下午，龙华、徐家汇、常熟、卢家湾、嵩山、蓬莱、邑庙等区及公共交通、法商电车公司和英商电车公司等职工就出动了万多人组成的人民保安队和宣传队。交通大学、同济大学、复旦大学、暨南大学、美术专科学校等校学生的行列在中午就出现在街头，贴标语，挂漫画，扭秧歌，向解放军献花。其中有一条标语写着：“我们的日子来了！”美专画了一张屋一样高的毛主席巨像，由同学们抬上，在欢呼的锣鼓声中送到大世界门前张挂起来。
    解放的第二天，二十六日，大街小巷红旗飘扬。公共汽车电车也都打扮得五　彩缤纷地重新行驰霞飞路上。由中华职业学校等联合组成的宣传队冒着雨在街上欢畅地歌唱，有一个歌是：“春天到了百花开，反动政府倒了台。夏天到了荷花开，人民军队到上海。”下午，雨虽越下越大，一辆辆宣传车，一队队宣传组，依然锣鼓喧天在街上穿梭往来。南京东路国际饭店大厦前，整齐地排列着国民党十二军的二十余辆军用车，上面棉衣棉被堆得满满的。守卫这些车的一位解放军战士幽默地说：“国民党真会办事，夏天就给解放军准备好棉衣棉被了。”这些车旁边还放着用卡车牵引的两门崭新的战防炮。显然是国民党匪军来不及拉走仓皇地抛弃下的。
    自来水桥以东苏州河以北的匪军虽然仍不时射击着，但许多为胜利鼓舞着的市民，都跟着解放军后面冲到苏州河边去看解放军解决这些残敌。外白渡桥附近还有零星战斗，但南市一带江面的木船汽艇已往来如织。
    “誓死保卫大上海”，这是五月二十四日下午国民党匪帮所谓“庆祝保卫大上海胜利”的口号之一，但是恰恰就在当夜，战犯汤恩伯、陈大庆等坐着飞机逃跑了，而人民解放军也就在当夜攻进上海的市区。国民党匪帮的这句谎言现在成了上海人民的笑谈。【新华社上海二十八日电】
