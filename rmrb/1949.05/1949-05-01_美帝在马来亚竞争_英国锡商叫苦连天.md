    Xinhua News Agency, Pingbei, 29th: Singapore dispatch: British tin companies in Malaya have recently been complaining bitterly about competition from the United States. Ferguson, general manager of the British Straits Trading Company, said at the company's annual meeting that a tin company in Texas, USA, subsidized by the US government, is buying large quantities of Siamese ore and shipping it to the United States for smelting. He said he did not know to what extent the Americans would damage the British tin smelting industry in Malaya. Tin is a special product and one of the main exports of Malaya. According to British Conservative Party Deputy Leader Eden in mid-March, the US dollar income from Malaya's tin and rubber exports is equal to the total value of all British exports last year.

    美帝在马来亚竞争
    英国锡商叫苦连天
    【新华社平北二十九日电】新加坡讯：马来亚英国锡业公司近来为美国的竞争而叫苦连天。英海峡贸易公司总经理佛尔格逊近在该公司的年会上说：美国德克萨斯州一家受美政府津贴的锡业公司，正在大批购买暹罗矿砂运赴美国冶炼。他说，他不知道美国人将英国在把马来亚的冶锡业损害到什么程度。按锡为马来亚的特产和主要输出品之一，据英保守党副首领艾登上月中旬说：马来亚的锡和橡皮两项输美所得的美元，等于英本国去年全部输出品价值的总和。
