Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 9th (via TASS, Moscow): This spring, collective farms and state-owned farms in the Soviet Union have achieved significant success in afforestation, and are now continuing to plant trees and forests effectively to realize the Soviet government's plan to establish farmland shelterbelts. The tree planting work in the Ukus and Krasnodar regions has greatly exceeded the predetermined annual target. In southern Russia, the spring work plans in Stavropol, Rostov, Grozny, Crimea, Astrakhan, and other states have also been exceeded, with some states exceeding them by four or even five times. Sowing in forest nurseries has already begun in all grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union. Six thousand hectares have been sown with seeds of various trees and shrubs. This work has been completed in several states. A total of one hundred and fourteen shelterbelt stations have been established nationwide. These shelterbelt stations have tractors, plows, cultivators, automobiles, etc. More than three hundred of the latest forest planting machines designed by Soviet engineers have begun to be used. "Honeycomb" special tractors have begun production. These tractors will accelerate afforestation work. National scientific institutions have dispatched six expeditions to the border regions where national farmland shelterbelts will be planted, to help collective farmers and state-owned farm workers quickly complete Stalin's plan to transform nature.

    贯彻农田防护林带计划
    苏联各地植林成就重大
    有些地区超过春季植树计划五倍
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联集体农场与国营农场，今春在造林方面获得重大的成就，现正继续以良好的方法植树造林，以实现苏联政府关于建立农田防护林带的计划。乌克斯和克拉斯诺达边疆区的植树工作，已大大地超过了预定的一年的目标。在南俄的斯塔夫罗波尔、罗斯多夫、格罗斯尼、克里米亚、阿斯特拉罕和其他等州的春季工作计划也都已超过，其中某些州且已超过四倍，甚至五倍。森林苗圃的播种已经在苏联欧洲部分的一切草原和森林草原地区开始进行。六千公顷已经播上了各种不同的树木和灌木树的种子。此项工作在若干州已经完成。在全国，已经设立了一百一十四个防护林站。这些防护林站有拖拉机、犁、耕种机、汽车等。苏联工程师所设计的三百多台最新式的森林种植机，已开始被使用。“蜂巢式”专用拖拉机已开始生产。这些拖拉机将加速造林工作。全国科学机关已派出六个远征队到行将种植国家农田防护林带的边疆区，去帮助集体农民和国营农场工人迅速完成斯大林改造自然的计划。
