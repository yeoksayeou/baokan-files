　　Organize the Poor for Self-Reliance in Production
  　Taiyuan People's Bank Issues Small Loans
    [Our Dispatch] After the liberation of Taiyuan, the Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China, in conjunction with the Production Self-Reliance Committee and the District Government, organized former unemployed workers and the poor for production self-reliance in Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 on April 28. It also issued small loans to support the masses who were actively engaged in production or had the conditions for production but lacked funds. From April 28 to May 11, a period of fourteen days, the five districts lent a total of 519,500 yuan to 530 households, solving the livelihood of nearly 2,000 people. Most of the loan recipients are carrying out production according to their original production plans, such as grinding tofu, boiling salt, blacksmithing, selling vegetables, and selling odd cooked food. Some organized mutual aid groups to grind tofu after receiving loans, with each person earning 200-300 yuan per day.
