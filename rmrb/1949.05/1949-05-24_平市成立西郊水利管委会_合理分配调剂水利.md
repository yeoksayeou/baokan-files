　　Ping City Establishes Western Suburbs Water Conservancy Management Committee
  　Rationally Allocate and Regulate Water Resources
    [Ping City News] To rationally allocate and regulate water resources, Ping City has established the Western Suburbs Water Conservancy Management Committee. Beiping has historically relied on water from Yuquan Mountain in the western suburbs to fill Kunming Lake and the three lakes within the city, irrigating over 20,000 mu of paddy fields in the western suburbs. In recent years, the water yield from Yuquan Mountain has decreased annually, while water consumption has increased annually, often leading to water shortages in the spring, and even disputes over water. Because there was no snow last winter and little rain this spring, this year's water shortage is even more severe. To solve this problem, on the 17th of this month, Director Cao of the Construction Bureau and Deputy Director Dong of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, along with surveyors, conducted an on-site investigation in the Yuquan Mountain area of the western suburbs and convened a meeting of cadres from the 17th and 18th districts who are familiar with the water conservancy situation. The following principles and methods for resolution were determined: 1. Taking both urban and rural areas into consideration, the city should give consideration to the rural farmers' rice transplanting season, allowing the rural masses to use water first. However, farmers must also take into account the living needs of the people in the city, and water must be drawn from the three lakes in the city when necessary. Currently, to take care of farmers' production, the water from Yuquan Mountain and Kunming Lake will not temporarily enter the city; instead, the water source of Zizhuyuan will be closed to supply the city. 2. Rational allocation: It was decided that during the rice transplanting period, the water from Yuquan Mountain will mainly be used for the more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields in the 17th district; the existing water level of Kunming Lake is allowed to drop from 9.7 "gong cun" to 7 "gong cun." That is, 2.7 "gong cun" of water will be used for the more than 17,000 mu of paddy fields in the 18th district. 3. Organize and strengthen management: For this reason, the Western Suburbs Water Conservancy Management Committee was organized. Below the district level, the construction sections of each district will assign special personnel to inspect, supervise, and resolve water use issues in all paddy field villages. Villages will set up water conservancy groups, with respected and impartial veteran farmers elected by the paddy field households as the group leaders, responsible for managing the use and allocation of water resources in their villages. Furthermore, efforts will be made to develop water sources, and the North China Agricultural and Forestry Department will be invited to send well-drilling teams to assist in repairing old wells so that those with well water available will not use lake water.

　　平市成立西郊水利管委会
  　合理分配调剂水利
    【平市讯】为合理分配与调剂水利，平市成立西郊水利管理委员会。北平向依西郊玉泉山之水，灌注昆明湖及城内三海，灌溉西郊一带二万余亩之稻田。近几年来，因玉泉山之出水量逐年减少，而用水量逐年增加，每至春季，时常发生水荒，甚至发生争水现象。因去冬无雪，今春缺雨，今年水荒更甚。为解决此问题、本月十七日，北平市人民政府建设局曹局长、民政局董副局长，协同测量人员赴西郊玉泉山一带实地调查，并召开十七、十八两区村熟习水利情况的干部会议，定出以下解决的原则与办法：一、城乡兼顾，城内照顾城外农民插秧季节，先让城外群众使水，但农民亦须照顾城内人民之生活需要，必要时得向城内三海灌水。目前为照顾农民之生产，玉泉山昆明湖之水暂不入城，另关紫竹院之水源，供给城内。二、合理分配：决定在插秧期间，玉泉山之水主要供十七区四千余亩稻田之用；昆明湖现有之水位允许由九公寸七降至七公寸。即二公寸七之水量，供十八区一万七千余亩稻田之用。三、组织起来，加强管理：为此组织西郊水利管理委员会。区以下由各区建设科指定专人分工检查督促解决所有稻田村庄之用水问题。村设水利小组，由稻田户推选公正有威信之老农任组长，负责掌握本村水利之使用与分配。并尽量开辟水源，邀请华北农林部派造井队协助修复旧井，使凡有井水可用者，即不使湖水。
