  　Tianjin People's Court Handling Cases Experience
    [Another News] The Tianjin People's Court, in handling over two thousand seven hundred cases, has gained the following points of experience.
    (1) Whether in judgment or reconciliation, the spirit of persuasion and education and clearing up thoughts should be implemented. Although the Tianjin People's Court's case closure rate, judging from the numbers, is not more than that of the puppet courts, the puppet courts in the past could not solve problems even after closing cases. We, however, can solve a problem for every case closed. This is completely different from the Kuomintang era. This can be illustrated by the large proportion of reconciliations and the small number of appeals. To achieve this, in addition to relying on the correct grasp of policies, it is necessary to solve the ideological crux of the parties involved. It is necessary to patiently persuade and educate, raise the consciousness of the masses, and thus thoroughly eliminate the ideological root of disputes. To this end, court cadres must work hard to continuously improve their political and theoretical level, and pay attention to learning from the masses and absorbing their opinions. In a housing rent dispute, both parties were laborers. During reconciliation in the district government, the tenant was asked to provide three kilograms of corn flour per room per month, but the tenant firmly refused. Therefore, the appeal was brought to the court. Zhang Li from the court explained to them, "You are all working people and should help and love each other, work hard to produce, and live a good life in the future," which inspired their class consciousness. The parties were very moved, and the tenant agreed to provide five kilograms of corn flour per room per month as rent, and a reconciliation was reached. Someone asked him, why did you refuse to give three kilograms, but now you are willing to give five kilograms? He said, "I understand in my heart and feel happy."
    (2) Deepen into the masses to investigate the case. Some judges and clerks use their Sunday holidays to visit the parties' neighbors or homes to investigate and hold seminars, which not only makes the investigation materials accurate and rapid, but also greatly educates the masses, making it easy to solve problems correctly.
    (3) In order to improve work efficiency and clarify the division of labor, it is considered necessary to establish an enforcement division. Secondly, civil and criminal cases are planned to be separated, and cases are classified according to their type, such as marriage disputes, debts, rent, and labor disputes in civil cases, and theft, fraud, and disruption of finance in criminal cases. Forces are organized separately according to the complexity of the cases to handle different cases, which is convenient for accumulating experience and for collecting and researching various materials.
    (4) In order to overcome the backlog of cases, in addition to taking other measures, the trial procedures and methods for certain cases are also being prepared for reform. First of all, for a large number of thieves, the method of holding a trial and writing a judgment for each person (the old method) is somewhat formalistic and may not solve the actual problem. In the future, cadres will be assigned to lead the transformation and education of all thieves. Immediately after entering prison, education will be started, ordering them to confess and reflect; then, through the mass line, guidance and enlightenment, the length of time of compliance with the law is evaluated. After the cadres organize the materials according to the forms and propose specific opinions, it is considered a judgment after approval by the higher authorities. Furthermore, the education and transformation of prisoners should be implemented in every aspect. Those who perform well can be released early. Before and after release, a lot of work must be done on the prisoners in all aspects, such as ideological transformation, life after release, and mobilizing the masses to supervise, so that the problem can be truly and thoroughly solved.

  　天津人民法院处理案件经验
    【又讯】天津市人民法院在处理二千七百余件案件中，得到以下数点经验。
    （一）无论审判与和解，均应贯彻说服教育与打通思想的精神。天津人民法院现结案从数字看虽然不比伪法院结案多，但过去伪法院结了案并不能解决问题，我们则结一件即能解决一件问题，这是与国民党时期完全不同的。这从和解占很大比重、上诉者很少的情况可以说明。要作到这一步，除依靠正确的掌握政策外，即须解决当事人的思想症结。要耐心说服教育，提高群众觉悟，从而彻底消除闹纠纷的思想根源。为此，法院干部须努力学习，不断提高自己的政治理论水平，并注意向群众学习，吸收群众的意见。有一件房租纠纷，双方当事人都是劳动者，在区政府和解时，让承租人每间房每月拿三斤玉米面，承租人坚决不承认，因而上诉到法院来，经法院张利同志向他们解释：“你们都是劳动人民，应互助友爱，努力生产，今后过好日子”，启发了他们的阶级觉悟。当事人很受感动，承租人承认每间房每月拿五斤玉米面的租，和解了。有人问他叫你拿三斤不干，现在怎么愿拿五斤呢？他说：“我心里明白了，觉得高兴。”
    （二）深入群众调查案情。有的审判员、书记员利用星期日休假时间亲到当事人邻居或家中访问，调查，开座谈会，不但调查材料确实迅速，对群众教育也很大，使问题很容易正确解决。
    （三）为了提高工作效率，明确分工，认为有建立执行庭的必要。其次是民刑案件拟分开，并拟就案件类别如民事中的婚姻纠纷、债务、房租、劳资纠纷等问题，刑事中的偷盗、诈欺、扰乱金融等，各根据案件繁简分别组织力量，处理不同的案件，这样便于积累经验，并便于对各项材料的汇集与研究。
    （四）为了克服案件的积压现象，除采取其他措施外，对某些案件的审判程序与方法也准备加以改革。首先是大批窃盗犯，采取每个开庭每个写一个判决的办法（老办法）有些形式主义，又不一定解决实际问题；今后对窃盗犯采取派干部专人领导所有窃盗犯的改造教育，入狱后即从教育着手，令其坦白反省；然后通过群众路线，引导启发，评议守法时间之长短。经干部按表册整理材料，拟出具体意见，经上级批准，即算判决。并对犯人教育改造贯彻到每个环节中，表现好的可提前释放。出狱前后对犯人须要在各方面作很多工作，如思想的改造、出狱后的生活，发动群众监督，这样才能真正彻底的解决问题。
