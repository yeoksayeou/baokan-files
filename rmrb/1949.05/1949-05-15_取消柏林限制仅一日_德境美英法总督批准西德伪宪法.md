    Lifting of Berlin Restrictions Lasts Only One Day
    U.S., British, and French Governors in Germany Approve West German Puppet Constitution
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, Fourteenth] Berlin dispatch: The so-called "Bonn Constitutional Convention," which is splitting Germany and which passed the West German constitution on the 8th, was approved on the 12th by the military government governors of the U.S., British, and French zones in Germany. This action occurred within twenty-four hours of the lifting of various restrictions in the Berlin area. The Associated Press admits that this action demonstrates the Western powers' "determination to establish a West German government independently before a German peace treaty is concluded."
