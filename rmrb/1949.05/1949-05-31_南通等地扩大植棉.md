Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi - Nantong and Taibei (a newly established county north of Dongtai), Jiangsu Province, are expanding the area of cotton fields, improving cotton seeds, and increasing cotton production to meet the needs of industrial production. Taibei has decided to restore 250,000 mu of cotton fields, planning to increase net cotton production by 37,500 dan compared to last year. To this end, the county has decided to provide an additional 30 million yuan (Beihai currency) in loans, in addition to the 30 million yuan already distributed in March, as well as 3,000 dan of cotton seeds, 70,000 jin of grain, and a set of agricultural tools to solve the difficulties of cotton farmers. Cadres in various regions have also been conducting widespread propaganda and education among farmers to dispel concerns that cotton will not be sold and that they will not be able to exchange it for grain, in order to boost the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers. According to statistics from three districts over twenty days, more than 15,000 mu of cotton fields have been expanded. In order to improve cotton seeds and increase cotton production, the Nantong District Commissioner's Office Production and Construction Department decided that before the summer planting, the cotton seed extension station would lend 1,400 dan of high-quality cotton seeds in Sanyu in Nantong County and Juedong in Rudong County (a newly established county in eastern Rugao), to promote 17,000 mu of cotton fields, and set up experimental farms in Sanyu District to conduct experiments.

　　南通等地扩大植棉
    【新华社无锡电】江苏省南通、台北（东台以北新设县）等县，正扩大种植棉田的面积，改良棉种，提高棉产，以适应工业生产之需要。台北决定恢复棉田二十五万亩，计划较去年增产净棉三万七千五百担，为此，该县已决定除三月份已发放之三千万元（北海币）贷款外，再增贷棉籽三千担、粮七万斤及农具一部，以解决棉民的困难。各地干部并已普遍对农民进行宣传教育，清除棉农以为棉花没销路，换不到粮食等顾虑，以提高棉农的生产情绪。据三个区二十天的统计，已扩大棉田一万五千余亩。南通区专署生产建设处为改良棉种，增加棉产，决定夏种前由棉种推广所在南通县之三余、如东（如皋东部新设县）县之掘东等区，贷放优良棉种一千四百担，推广棉田一万七千亩，并在三余区设立实验场进行实验。
