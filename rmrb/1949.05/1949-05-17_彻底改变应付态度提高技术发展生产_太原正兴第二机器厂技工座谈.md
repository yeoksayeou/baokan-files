　　【Taiyuan Telegram】The Taiyuan Zhengxing No. 2 Machine Factory held a symposium for technical personnel at the factory's Workers' Club on the 5th. More than 60 people attended, including the factory director, engineers, inspectors, and team leaders of technicians. The meeting revealed that, due to Yan Xishan's excessive exploitation and mistreatment of employees in the past, a perfunctory, evasive, rough, and shoddy attitude of "dealing with the public half-heartedly" was prevalent from top to bottom, from staff to workers, in resistance to Yan's persecution. Everyone unanimously agreed that now that liberation has been achieved, lives are secured, and social status is elevated, future production will directly create wealth for the broad masses of the people, which is also creating wealth for the employees; therefore, the previous attitude of "dealing with the public half-heartedly" must be completely changed. First, we must strengthen scientific and technological research, not only to increase output, but also to improve quality. Zhang Hongbin said, "The tools used in the past were not up to standard, so the goods produced were also not refined. In the future, there should be dedicated personnel for making tools, and we should not rely solely on apprentices." Wang Zenghai suggested that, in order to enable apprentices to learn quickly and precisely, a research class could be set up jointly by veteran workers and trainees, so that apprentices would not only learn how to use machines, but also understand the principles, structure, performance, and use of drawings, so that theory and practice can be truly combined. He also said, "The conservative view of 'teaching an apprentice starves the master' that masters have held in the past must be completely eliminated, so that the industrial production of the new China can be developed on a large scale."

　　彻底改变应付态度提高技术发展生产
    太原正兴第二机器厂技工座谈
    【太原电】太原市正兴第二机器厂于五日在该厂职工俱乐部召开技术人员座谈会。到会有厂长、工程师、检验人员、技工组长等六十余人。会上检讨出：由于过去阎匪压榨、苛待职工过甚，所以自上而下的，从职员到工人普遍地存在着一种敷衍、搪塞、粗制、滥造的“应付公家”态度，反抗阎匪迫害。大家一致认为：现在已经解放了，生活有了保障，社会地位提高，今后的生产是直接为广大人民创造财富，也就是为职工创造财富；因此已往“应付公家”的态度必须彻底改变过来。首先要加强科学技术的研究，不仅要加多产量，且更要提高质量。张鸿宾说：“过去用的工具不规矩，所以做出来的货也就不精致，以后制工具要有专人，不要光靠学徒。”王增海提议：为了使学徒学习得又快又精，可以由老工人和练习生共同设一个研究班，使学徒不仅学习使用机器而且还要懂得绘图的原理与构造、性能和用途，便理论和实际真正的结合起来。他并说：“已往师傅们所存有的‘教会徒弟、饿死师傅’的保守观点必须彻底消除，这样始能大规模地发展新中国的工业生产。”
