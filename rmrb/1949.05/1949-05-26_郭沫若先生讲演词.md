[This City News] Mr. Guo Moruo's speech at the welcoming rally of the people of Beiping:
　　Fellow members of the delegation, after two months and a journey of 20,000 kilometers, we have now returned to Beiping. We are very encouraged by the warm welcome from our compatriots in Beiping, who say that we have "returned victoriously."
　　The World Peace Congress was held simultaneously in Paris and Prague. One meeting, two venues. Seventy-two countries participated, with 2,005 representatives, representing more than 800 million people. After five days of harmonious, enthusiastic, and intense meetings, a common declaration and resolution were reached. The peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, will strengthen unity, resolutely oppose imperialism, oppose atomic weapons, oppose the new fascists who dominate the world, and use strong forces to eliminate the crisis of a third world war and strive for lasting world peace.
　　The Peace Congress did end successfully, and the representatives of all countries believed that it was a success, and therefore we returned victoriously. But we clearly know that this victory was given to us by the wise leader Chairman Mao, by the heroic People's Liberation Army, and by the compatriots in the entire liberated areas who worked hard to produce and support the front. We would like to pay our sincere respects to Chairman Mao, to the entire People's Liberation Army, and to the compatriots in the entire liberated areas! All victory belongs to the people, all victory belongs to the people's leader Chairman Mao! All glory belongs to the people, all glory belongs to the people's leader Chairman Mao!
　　Compatriots! The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has indeed given great encouragement to the Congress. On April 23, when the news of the liberation of Nanjing reached Europe, the representatives in the two venues in Paris and Prague stood up together and shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation!" They applauded, shook hands, hugged, and kissed, and the hall was in an uproar for a full twenty minutes.
　　The people of the world regard China's victory as their own victory and consider China's victory as an important factor in striving for world peace. With the victory of the Chinese people, the balance of power between the two major camps in the world has indeed undergone a major change. The strength of the peace camp, led by the Soviet Union, far exceeds that of the aggressive camp, led by American imperialism.
　　Compatriots! The success of the Peace Congress is, of course, due to the great contributions of the people of all countries participating in the Congress, and especially the peace fortress, the Soviet Union, has made the greatest contribution. The success of the Peace Congress is in fact the success of the Soviet Union's firm peace policy, and the spirit of the great leader of all mankind, Stalin, has inspired peace-loving people all over the world, united everyone, and demonstrated their strength.
　　Compatriots! The socialist country, the Soviet Union, is truly an uncompromising and incomparably strong peace fortress. The rapid progress of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and the people's peaceful and happy life are something we cannot praise enough.
　　We passed through Siberia on our way back and forth, going by train and returning by plane. What we saw on the Siberian Plain was an endless forest, all cultivated after the October Revolution. In just about twenty years, Siberia is no longer the barren and desolate land of the Tsarist era.
　　There were originally many forests in the Soviet Union. But recently, a great afforestation plan is being carried out, planting trees from the Ural Mountains all the way to the shores of the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. Five forests, each ten kilometers wide, are to be planted to block the hot wind blowing from Central Asia and prevent damage to agricultural products. The original plan was for fifteen years, but planting has already begun, and it is estimated that it can be completed seven years ahead of schedule.
　　Like this, the people of the Soviet Union, the scholars of the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the Soviet Union are concerned about how to fight against nature, how to improve technology, increase production, and complete plans ahead of schedule, so that socialist construction can be quickly successful and move towards the stage of communism.
　　After the Peace Congress closed, we were very fortunate to visit the May Day parade in Moscow. We saw with our own eyes the great array of Soviet people's armed forces, with countless sophisticated weapons rolling past us under extremely skilled manipulation. We saw with our own eyes three kinds of high-speed aircraft that were faster than sound, flying eight hundred kilometers per hour, quietly flying from the front and quietly flying overhead. Only then did we hear the roaring sound. We saw with our own eyes a grand parade of two million people, like the waves in the sea, marching for a full seven hours on the vast Red Square, from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, before it was over. We also saw with our own eyes the great leader of mankind, Stalin, personally standing on Lenin's Mausoleum to participate in the parade, also standing for a full seven hours from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. What amazing health, what a democratic demeanor! "Long live Stalin!" The unanimous roar shook the heaven and earth of Red Square. The Soviet people showed sincere love for their leader.
　　The leader and the people are one, the people and the armed forces are one, under the illumination of internationalist patriotism, guaranteeing the success of socialist construction and guaranteeing the inevitable victory of the peace and democracy camp.
　　Compatriots! The Peace Congress was a success. But the success of the Peace Congress does not mean the success of the cause of striving for world peace. Our work is still ahead. We must abide by the declaration and resolutions of the Congress, and under the leadership of the peace fortress, the Soviet Union, work closely with the people of the world with the strength of the entire Chinese people to strive for our final success.
　　This work is inseparable from the victory of our liberation war and the completion of the construction of a new democratic New China.
　　Under the strong leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our liberation war will soon achieve complete victory. Under the strong leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the construction of a new democratic New China must also achieve complete victory at a rapid pace.
　　If China's revolution is successful, China's industrialization is successful, China's peace can be guaranteed, and the peace of the Far East and even the peace of the whole world can be guaranteed.
　　Compatriots! Let us work harder and learn from the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the Chinese People's Liberation! Long live the success of the New Democracy!
　　Long live the victory of lasting world peace!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live Chairman Mao! (With picture)

　　郭沫若先生讲演词
    【本市讯】郭沫若在北平人民欢迎大会上的讲演全文：
    代表团的同人们，经过了两个月的时间，往返了两万公里的路程，现在回到北平来了。承蒙北平各界的同胞们，这样热烈地欢迎我们，说我们“胜利归来”，使我们感受着很大的鼓励。
    世界拥护和平大会是在巴黎和布拉格两地同时召开的。一个会议，两个会场。参加的国家七十二个，代表二千零五个人，所代表的人民在八万万以上。经过了五天的和谐、热烈、紧张的会议，得到了一个共同的宣言，共同的决议。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，要加紧团结，坚决地反对帝国主义，反对原子武器，反对独霸全世界的新法西斯蒂，要用坚强的力量来消灭第三次世界大战的危机，争取全世界的持久和平。
    和平大会的确是顺利地结束了，各国的代表们都认为收到了成功，因而我们也就获得了胜利归来。但这胜利，我们明确地知道是英明的领袖毛主席给予我们的，英勇作战的全体解放军给予我们的，努力生产、支援前线的全解放区的同胞们给予我们的。我们谨以十二分的至诚向毛主席致敬，向全体解放军致敬，向全解放区的同胞们致敬！一切胜利属于人民，一切胜利属于人民领袖毛主席！一切光荣属于人民，一切光荣属于人民领袖毛主席！
    同胞们！中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，的确是给予了大会以很大的鼓励。四月二十三号南京解放的消息传到欧洲，巴黎和布拉格两个会场上的代表们都一致起立，欢呼“毛泽东万岁！”“中国人民解放万岁！”鼓掌，握手，拥抱，亲脸，足足哄堂了二十分钟之久。
    全世界的人民是把中国的胜利当成了自己的胜利，把中国的胜利认为是争取世界和平的重要的因素。有了中国人民的胜利使世界上两大对垒的力量对比，的确是发生了重大的变化。以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量，是远远超过了以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的力量了。
    同胞们！和平大会的成功，参加大会的各国的人民不用说都有重大的贡献，而尤其是和平堡垒的苏联是有着最大的贡献的。和平大会的成功，事实上是苏联的坚定不移的和平政策的成功，是伟大的全人类的领袖斯大林，他的精神感召了全世界爱好和平的人民，使大家团结了起来，表现了自己的力量。
    同胞们！社会主义国家的苏联，那真是一座不折不扣的坚强无比的和平堡垒。苏联的和平建设的突飞猛进，人民生活的安居乐业，是我们所颂扬不尽的。
    我们往返都经过西比利亚，去是坐火车，来是坐飞机，我们所见到的西比利亚平原是一望无涯的森林，都是十月革命以后的栽培，只有二十年左右的光景，西比利亚已经不再是帝俄时代的荒漠不毛之地了。
    苏联境内，本来是很多森林的。但在最近又在进行着一项伟大的植林计划，从乌拉尔山一直栽到里海和黑海的边上。要栽五条森林，每条宽十公里，用来阻挡从中央亚细亚吹过去的热风，以免损害农产物。本来预定的是十五年计划，已经开始栽种，据估计只要七年便可以提前完成了。
    就象这样，苏联的人民，苏联的学者，苏联的领袖，他们所关心的就是怎样和自然界斗争，怎样改进技术，提高生产，提前完成计划，使社会主义的建设迅速成功，走上共产主义的阶段。
    和平大会闭幕后，我们很幸运地在莫斯科参观了五一劳动节的大检阅。我们亲眼看见苏联人民武力的伟大的阵容，无数精锐的武器在极熟练的操纵之下从我们的面前滚过。我们亲眼看见比声音还要快的三种快速度飞机，一小时可飞八百公里，悄悄地从前面飞来，悄悄从头上飞过。之后，又才听见轰＠＠的吼声。我们亲眼看见二百万人的大游行，象大海里的波涛一样，在那广阔的红场上，从上午十时起到下午五时，足足走了七个钟头，才走完了。我们也亲眼看见伟大的人类领袖斯大林，亲自站在列宁墓上参加检阅，从上午十时起到下午五时，也足足站了七个钟头。这是多么惊人的健康，多么民主的风度呵！“斯大林万岁！”万口同声地吼着，震荡着红场的天地。苏联人民对于自己的领袖表现了倾诚的爱戴。
    领袖和人民是一体，人民和武装力量是一体，在国际主义的爱国主义的照耀之下，保障了社会主义建设的成功，并保障了和平民主阵营的必然的胜利。
    同胞们！和平大会是成功了。但是和平大会的成功并不就是争取世界和平事业的成功，我们的工作还在后面。我们要遵守大会的宣言和决议，在和平堡垒苏联的领导之下，用全中国人民的力量来和全世界人民密切合作，争取我们的最后的成功。
    这项工作和我们解放战争的胜利，新民主主义新中国建设的完成是分不开来的。
    我们的解放战争在毛主席，在中国共产党的坚强领导之下，很快的便要得到全面胜利了。新民主主义新中国的建设，在毛主席，在中国共产党的坚强领导之下，也必须以很快的速度获得全面胜利。
    中国的革命成功了，中国的工业化成功了，中国的和平便可以得到保障，远东的和平以至全世界的和平也就可以得到保障了。
    同胞们！我们加倍努力，向苏联看齐！
    中国人民解放万岁！新民主主义成功万岁！
    世界持久和平胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！（附图片）
