　　Workers at Tongxian South Station Still Under Oppression
  　Former Station Master Liu Baolan and Others Should Be Appropriately Dealt With
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The former station master of Pinggu Railway Tongxian South Station, Liu Baolan, the deputy station master, Zhou Shaochang, and the general affairs officer, Yang Ruicheng, etc., manipulate the trade union, suppress workers' democracy, and carry out dark rule. There are a total of 47 employees at the station, including 37 track maintenance, loading and unloading, and station porters, and 10 staff members. Before liberation, Liu Baolan, Zhou Shaochang, Yang Ruicheng, and others oppressed and exploited the workers in everything. The money earned by the loading and unloading workers, as well as the coal and engine oil used by the station, were often embezzled by Liu Baolan and others. Workers were often forced to fetch water, buy groceries, and sweep the yard for them; otherwise, they would be transferred or dismissed. After liberation last December, workers, under the leadership of the work team, established their own trade union, began to express their opinions, and broke free from exploitation and oppression. Seeing the workers rising up, Liu Baolan and others basely scared the workers, saying, "The Kuomintang will come back in the future, and the Eighth Route Army will be finished sooner or later." Seeing that Comrade Tang from the work team lived frugally, they invited Comrade Tang to eat in restaurants, embezzling the station's coal. After being rejected, they secretly colluded with some staff members, saying that Tang was bureaucratic, signing accusations, and forcing Tang to leave the station. Then, they convened all the station staff and forced the trade union to be reorganized, with the old general affairs officer, Yang Ruicheng, becoming the chairman of the trade union. In this way, they rode on the workers' heads again. The workers dared not speak out, and their morale was low. Recently, cadres from the Pinggu Line Trade Union Branch went to the station to organize the workers. After repeated mobilization, the workers are still not very daring to act. It is hoped that the leaders in the area will take appropriate action against Liu Baolan and others. (Jian)

　　通县南站工人至今仍受压迫
  　旧站长刘宝岚等应适当处理
    【本报讯】平古路通县南站旧站长刘宝岚、副站长周绍昌、总务杨瑞呈等操纵职工会，压制工人民主，进行着黑暗的统治。该站共有职工四十七人，其中道班、装卸、站夫搬道工人三十七名，职员十人。解放前，刘宝岚、周绍昌、杨瑞呈等即事事压迫剥削工人。装卸工人赚的钱，站上公用的煤和行车油，经常被刘宝岚等贪污。工人经常得给他们挑水、买菜、扫院听其使唤，否则就会被调走或撤职。去年十二月解放后，工人在工作组领导下成立了自己的职工会，开始发表自己的意见，摆脱了剥削压迫。刘宝岚等看到工人起来，就卑鄙地吓唬工人说：“将来国民党还得来，八路军早晚要完蛋。”见到工作组唐同志生活坚苦，就邀唐同志去吃馆子，贪污站上的煤。遭拒绝后，就暗地里拉拢一些职员，说唐官僚主义，签名控告，将唐逼离该站。接着召集全站职工，强迫将职工会作了改造，旧总务杨瑞呈当了工会主任。这样，他们又骑到了工人头上，工人有话不敢说，情绪低落。日前平古线职工分会干部赴该站组织工人，经一再发动，至今工人还不大敢动。希望该地领导上对刘宝岚等能作适当的处理。（坚）
