    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] On the fifth day of the North China Workers' Representative Conference (the 6th), the delegations discussed Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report in groups. Comrade Shaoqi's report gave great encouragement to the conference. The delegates felt it was a source of strength and hope, because it provided clear answers to the main problems currently existing in the restoration and development of industrial production. Regarding the issue of wartime industry transforming into peacetime industry, the representative from the Qianjin Military Shoe Factory in the Taihang District, for example, said that because the troops were moving south, the workers also needed to change jobs, and that in the past they relied solely on the government, but now, "we must also think of solutions ourselves." The old liberated areas' Postal Administration, due to more convenient transportation, can reduce personnel in some areas. Now they feel that they need a specific plan for transformation. Regarding the relationship between the trade union and the factory administration, many people felt that in the past, coordination in some places was insufficient. Some trade unions always felt that they could not get more help from the administration, and some factory directors felt that the trade union was sometimes a nuisance. After listening to Comrade Shaoqi's report, the trade union comrades examined that in the past they were not responsible enough for production. Everyone believes that only if both sides are good at using the weapons of self-criticism and criticism can the relationship be close. In carrying out the democratic management movement in factories in the old liberated areas, all groups unanimously agreed that it is very important to have full deliberation before carrying it out, "opening the pot when it is ripe," and not be impatient. The Tangshan Railway workers' representative said: "Although we have only been liberated recently, we must also carry it out well in this spirit after we go back." Regarding the issue of planning in state-owned enterprises, many groups discussed it in their own departments. The Shijiazhuang Railway workers' representative group believes that there should be separate plans for each section, which should be integrated by the Railway Bureau into an overall plan. In terms of railway transportation, we should make every effort to assist in completing the production plans of other related enterprises. Regarding guaranteeing the supply of material goods to workers, the representatives said: "This is a universal demand of the workers." Although it is difficult to solve all problems appropriately for the time being, everyone felt very happy after listening to Comrade Shaoqi's report. Comrade Shaoqi's report gave the workers' representatives great confidence. The representative of the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau said: "In order to respond to Comrade Shaoqi's call, we must formulate specific ways to realize it." They also prepared to make a guarantee to the conference, to promote the great strength of the working class in the restoration and development of production.

    华北工代会议第五天
    讨论刘少奇同志报告
    到会代表充满力量和信心
    【本报讯】华北职工代表会议第五天（六日），各代表团分组讨论刘少奇同志的报告。少奇同志的报告予大会极大的鼓舞，代表们认为这是力量和希望，因为它对目前恢复和发展工业生产中所存在的主要问题，都作了明确的解答，关于战时工业转化为平时工业问题，如太行区前进军鞋工厂，因为部队南下，工人也就需要转业，过去单纯依靠政府，现在该厂代表说：“我们自己也要想办法”。老区邮政管理局，由于交通工具比过去方便，有的地方人员就可以相对减少，现在就感觉到自己需要一定具体转变的计划。关于工会和工厂行政两者之间的关系，很多人觉得有些地方过去不够协调，有的工会总觉得不能得到行政更多的帮助，有的厂长则感到工会方面有时候实在麻烦，听了少奇同志的报告后，工会同志检讨到过去对生产还不够切实负责，大家认为只有双方善于运用自我批评和批评的武器，关系才能密切，在老区开展工厂管理民主化运动，各小组中都一致认为十分重要，冀中区代表们觉得在开展这一运动前首先要有充分的酝酿，“几时成熟，几时开锅”不能性急。唐山铁路职工代表说：“我们虽然解放不久，但回去以后也要本着这个精神，好好进行”。关于国营企业计划性问题，许多小组就本部门作了讨论，石家庄铁路职工代表小组，认为应有各路段分别作计划，由路局总合为全盘计划，在铁路运输方面，并应尽最大努力，协助完成其他有关的企业单位的生产计划。关于保障工人的实物供给，代表们说：“这是工人的普遍要求”，虽然一时尚难全部适当解决，听了少奇同志报告以后，大家都觉得心里很痛快。少奇同志的报告予职工代表以莫大的信心，石家庄路局的代表说：“为了响应少奇同志的号召，我们要订出具体实现的办法”，他们并准备向大会提出保证，在恢复和发展生产中，发扬工人阶级的伟大力量。
