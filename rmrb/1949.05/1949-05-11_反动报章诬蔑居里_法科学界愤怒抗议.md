Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th. TASS reports: The French scientific community is fiercely protesting the slander of Curie, Chairman of the Presidium of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee and renowned physicist, by the reactionary French press. Since the conclusion of the Peace Congress, reactionary newspapers have been carrying out all kinds of defamation against Curie. Curie said at the conference on April 23, "If the French government asks us tomorrow to improve the tools of destruction, we will answer: absolutely not!" This statement was used by reactionary newspapers as an excuse to slander Curie, clamoring that Curie's activities in defending peace and his position as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission were "incompatible" and demanding the revocation of Curie's position. This shameless slander has aroused great anger in the French scientific community. The trade union of scientific institution workers and higher education and scientific research workers has declared its support for Curie. The progressive organization "French Intellectuals Movement for Peace" sent a protest to Premier Queuille, stating: Curie bravely explained the responsibility that currently falls on every worker engaged in scientific research, because the fate of mankind depends, to a great extent, on whether their discoveries are used to improve the welfare of the people or to oppose the people. The letter was signed by Professor Aubel, Atomic Energy Commission member Berthelot, Professor Derrechi and many other French scientists. The Scientists Association, with 1,400 members, also lodged a similar protest.

    反动报章诬蔑居里
    法科学界愤怒抗议
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社讯：法国科学界猛烈抗议法国反动报章对世界拥护和平大会常委会主席团主席、著名物理学家居里的诬蔑。在和平大会结束以后，反动报纸就进行对居里的种种诽谤。居里在四月二十三日的大会上说：“如果法国政府明天要我们改进毁灭的工具的话，我们将回答说：决不！”这句话被反动报纸用作诬蔑居里的借口，反动报纸叫嚣说居里保卫和平的活动和他的原子能委员会主席的职位“不能并容”，要求撤销居里的职位。这种无耻的诽谤激起了法国科学界极大的愤怒。科学机关工作者与高等教育和科学研究工作者工会为此特宣告他们声援居里。进步团体“法国知识分子保卫和平运动”致书法总理葛义抗议称：居里勇敢地说明了目前落在每一个从事科学研究工作者身上的责任。因为人类的命运多少要看他们的发现是用来改善人民的福利还是用来反对人民而定。签名在这封信上的有教授奥伯尔，原子能委员会委员贝特洛，教授德勒希和其他许多法国科学家。拥有一千四百会员的科学家协会也提出了同样抗议。
