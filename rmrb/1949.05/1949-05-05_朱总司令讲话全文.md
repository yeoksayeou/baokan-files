Comrades!

Today, I represent the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in addressing this conference. Seeing the growth of China's new generation of youth and their embarking on a path of brightness and happiness, I am truly delighted. Your youth, your vigorous vitality, and your infinitely bright future symbolize the hope of a new China.

Comrades! It has been exactly thirty years since the "May Fourth Movement," coinciding with the ancient saying "at thirty, one stands firm." These thirty years have been the most glorious for the Chinese nation and the most glorious for China's laboring youth and revolutionary intellectual youth. Now, the internal and external enemies of the Chinese revolution are about to enter the grave completely, and the Chinese people's revolution is about to achieve complete victory. The progress of Chinese history in the past thirty years is truly worthy of the past three hundred or three thousand years.

Why has China undergone such tremendous changes in the past thirty years? Because since the "May Fourth Movement," several unprecedented major events have occurred in Chinese society. These include: the contemporary industrial working class of China leading the Chinese people to the forefront of national and class struggles; the dissemination in China of the Marxist-Leninist theory, which guides the Chinese revolution on the only correct path; and the emergence, development, and growth of the Chinese Communist Party, among other facts. With these conditions, the Chinese people could carry out a conscious, organized, led, and promising revolution.

For thirty years, China's worker-peasant youth and revolutionary intellectual youth have always stood at the forefront of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. They have become the most valuable asset of our nation and the most beloved sons and daughters of our nation. For thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party has established an inseparable blood-and-flesh connection with China's worker-peasant youth and revolutionary intellectual youth, educating and nurturing generations of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals. Thirty years of history have proven that Chinese revolutionary youth, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, can certainly exert its greatest revolutionary power.

The "May Fourth Movement" thirty years ago first occurred among intellectual youth. I would now like to say a few more words about the issue of intellectual youth. Intellectual youth play a significant role in the Chinese revolution. The reason why they have played and will continue to play a significant role lies in their combination with the revolutionary movement of workers and peasants, becoming a part of the entire people's revolutionary movement; in their ability to abandon their original exploiting class position and serve the Chinese laboring people; and in their acceptance of the leadership of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. The correct direction for Chinese revolutionary intellectual youth is to continue along this path that has already been taken, and to continue to deepen the transformation of themselves, train themselves, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, achieve wholehearted service to the Chinese people, and transform themselves into a part of the laboring people. All intellectuals who violate the interests of the people and are enemies of the people will inevitably embark on the road of counter-revolution, like Hu Shih.

Now, the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government has fundamentally collapsed. The remaining counter-revolutionary remnants will also be wiped out by the People's Liberation Army in a short period. The construction of a new China has opened up infinitely beautiful prospects for Chinese youth and requires a large number of cadres in various fields. Our young comrades should summon up courage, eliminate the imperialist forces of aggression in China and the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary traitorous rule, and at the same time, must redouble their efforts to study in all aspects, learn their skills well, and prepare to dedicate themselves to the economic, political, military, cultural, scientific, technological, industrial, agricultural, and other construction undertakings of the new China. We have destroyed a backward, dark, unindependent, and unfree old China, but we must also build a new, independent, free, unified, prosperous, and strong New Democratic China. Overthrowing the old China and eliminating the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government over China, as Chairman Mao said, is only "the first step in a long march." More glorious, greater, and more arduous tasks are ahead. Chinese youth should follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, seek truth from facts, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and fight selflessly for the liberation of all of China and for the construction of a new China!

    朱总司令讲话全文
    青年同志们！
    我今天代表中国共产党中央委员会向大会致词，我看见了中国新的青年一代的长成，并且从此走上光明和幸福的大道，真是感到非常的高兴。你们的青春，你们的蓬蓬勃勃的朝气，你们的无限光明的前途，正是象征了新生中国的希望。
    同志们！“五四运动”到现在恰恰三十年了，正合了古人说的“三十而立”这句话。这三十年是中华民族最光荣的三十年，也是中国的劳动青年和革命知识青年最光荣的三十年。现在中国革命的内部的和外部的敌人眼看着就要全部走进坟墓了，中国人民的革命眼看着就要全部胜利了。近三十年中国历史的进步，真当得起过去的三百年、三千年。
    为什么近三十年中国会有这样巨大的变化呢？因为自“五四运动”以来，中国社会里发生了几件空前未有的大事变。这就是：中国当代产业工人阶级带领着中国人民走上民族的和阶级的斗争的前线；指导中国革命走上唯一正确道路的马克思列宁主义理论，在中国的传布，以及中国共产党的产生发展和壮大等等，几件事实。在有了这些条件以后，中国人民就可以进行自觉的、有组织的、有领导的、有胜利前途的革命了。
    三十年来，中国的工农青年和革命知识青年，始终是站在中国人民革命斗争的第一线，他们成了我们民族最可宝贵的财产，成了我们民族最可爱的子弟。三十年来，中国共产党与中国的工农青年和革命知识青年建立了血肉不可分的联系，教育和培养了几代的革命干部和革命的知识分子。三十年的历史证明，中国革命青年在马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的指导之下，在中国共产党的领导之下，就一定能发挥它最大的革命力量。
    三十年前的“五四运动”是首先发生于知识青年中的，我现在也就把知识青年问题提出来多说几句。知识青年在中国革命过程中是有重大作用的，它之所以发挥了和还将发生重大的作用，就在于他们和工农的革命运动相结合，成为整个人民革命运动的一部分；就在于他们能放弃他们原来的剥削阶级的立场，转而为中国劳动人民服务；就在于他们接受了马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的领导。中国革命知识青年的正确方向，就是继续走过这已经走过了的道路，并继续加深改造自己，锻炼自己，加强马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的学习，做到全心全意为中国人民服务，并把自己变成劳动人民的一部分。一切违反人民利益的，与人民为敌的知识分子，其结果都必然要走向反革命的道路，象胡适之那样。
    现在国民党反动卖国政府，是已经从根本上灭亡了，剩下的反革命残余，人民解放军也将在短期内把他们扫荡干净。新中国的建设为中国青年开辟了无限美妙的前途，需要各方面的大量的干部，我们的青年同志们应当鼓足勇气，把帝国主义在华的侵略势力和国民党的反革命卖国统治消灭得干干净净，同时必须加倍努力地进行各方面的学习，学好本领，准备献身于新中国的经济的、政治的、军事的、文化的、科学的、技术的、工业的、农业的等等各方面的建设事业。我们破坏了一个落后的、黑暗的、不独立不自由的旧中国，但我们还必须要建立一个独立、自由、统一、富强、繁荣的新民主主义的新中国。打破旧中国，消灭帝国主义和国民党反动卖国政府对中国的统治。正如毛主席所说，还只是走了“万里长征的第一步”，更光荣，更伟大，更艰巨的任务，还在前面，中国的青年应当遵循毛主席指出的方向，实事求是，戒骄戒躁，奋不顾身地为解放全中国而奋斗，为建设新中国而奋斗！
