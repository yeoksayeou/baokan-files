Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th: The breeding industry of draught animals in the Bohai Region of Shandong Province has achieved remarkable results. There are now 25 public breeding stations and 123 rural breeding stores. The latter alone has 469 head of breeding stock. The Kenli and other breeding stations of the Administrative Office Farm, in addition to providing breeding services for farmers' draught animals at the station, also regularly use a set of breeding stock (one head each of cattle, horse, and donkey) to provide mobile breeding services at market gatherings. The station also prints and distributes a large number of publicity materials to promote the breeding industry of draught animals, and has begun to change the old feudal notions among farmers who previously believed that "leading a large donkey to breed draught animals is a lowly life." Generally, breeding stations pay attention to fair breeding prices, and free re-breeding is provided if a first attempt is unsuccessful. According to March statistics, public and private breeding stations in the Administrative Office Farm, Huimin, Kenli and other counties have inseminated 644 head of livestock.

    山东渤海区
    设立公私营种畜站
    已配种六百四十头
    【新华社济南十三日电】山东省渤海区耕畜繁殖业已获显著成绩，现已有公营种畜站二十五处，农村种畜店一百二十三处。仅后者即有种畜四百六十九头。行署农场之垦利等种畜站，除在站内为农民的耕畜配种外，又经常以一套种畜（牛、马、驴各一头）流动赶集配种。该站并大量印发宣传品，提倡繁殖耕畜业，开始转变了过去农民中认为“牵大驴‘繁殖耕畜’是下贱生活”的封建旧观念。一般种畜站都注意了配种价格公道，一次不孕，免费再配。据三月份统计，行署农场、惠民、垦利等县公、私营种畜站已配种六百四十四头。
