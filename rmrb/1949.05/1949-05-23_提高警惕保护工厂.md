　　Raise Vigilance to Protect Factories

　　Many factories in Peiping, responding to the call of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, have organized workers' pickets to patrol and inspect, strictly preventing the activities of special agents and saboteurs. This is a completely correct and necessary measure.

　　Since the liberation of Peiping, the People's Government, relying on the broad masses of workers and the working people, has achieved great success in suppressing traitors and preventing special agents, and protecting the interests of the people of the whole city. However, the closer the people's enemies get to death, the more their conspiracies of sabotage will intensify, and the reactionaries will secretly drive their pawns, taking the opportunity to sabotage the construction undertakings of the revolutionary people. This has been consistently proven by Chinese and foreign history. The arson of more than fifty streetcars by special agents in Peiping is a recent example.

　　This situation requires all Party and People's Government personnel to raise a high degree of vigilance, and to put the issue of paying attention to the conspiracies of special agents and saboteurs and protecting the interests of the people on an important agenda. Of course, we should also recognize that these special agents are currently just clowns acting out a farce, a final flash of struggle in the dying throes of the entire Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. There is no need to be alarmed, let alone to be "paranoid." As long as we pay attention and carry out the necessary work, we can prevent problems before they occur and eliminate them in their infancy.

　　Protecting factories is one of the important tasks in our entire protection work. Protecting factories mainly relies on the awareness of the entire working class. The working class should be educated to recognize that factories are the valuable property of themselves and all the people, to cherish them, protect them, and not allow anyone to carry out the slightest destruction. The working class can easily understand this principle. They work in the factories, rely on the factories for their livelihood, and they regard the machines as their own lives. When they further realize that they have become the masters of state-owned factories, and that they also have an inseparable relationship with private factories, their enthusiasm will be unprecedentedly high, and they will come up with many methods that meet specific requirements. This truth has also been proven by the facts in many factories in Peiping.

　　Many factories have relied on workers to organize pickets, specifically responsible for protecting the factory, which has proven to be quite effective and should continue to be promoted. Experience has shown that the pickets should encourage workers to form automatically, avoiding formality. That is, they should go through the steps of voluntary registration and mass discussion, and select enthusiastic, loyal, shrewd, and capable members to take on the responsibility. The leadership should provide them with the necessary education at any time, so that they can competently and happily carry out their work. At the same time, they should be properly taken care of, so as not to make them excessively tired, which would affect their work and rest. Some workers voluntarily work overtime on patrol without overtime pay. This enthusiasm is good, but from the leadership's point of view, they should pay attention to this point and take care of them in other ways, so that their enthusiasm can be fully sustained and achieve the sacred task of protecting the people's factories.

### 提高警惕保护工厂

　　提高警惕保护工厂
    北平许多工厂响应市委和市总工会的号召，组织工人纠察队，巡逻检查，严防特务破坏分子活动，这是完全正确的、必要的措施。
    北平解放后，人民政府依靠广大工人和劳动人民，肃奸防特，保护全市人民的利益，已经获得很大的成绩。但是，人民的敌人越接近死亡，其特务破坏的阴谋越要加剧，反动派更会秘密驱使其爪牙，乘机伺隙，破坏革命人民的建设事业，这是中外历史一致证明了的。北平特务纵火焚毁五十几辆电车，就是最近的一个现实例子。
    这种情况要求全党和人民政府的工作人员提起高度的警惕。把注视特务破坏分子的阴谋、保卫人民利益的问题提到重要的议事日程上来。当然，我们也应该认识，这些特务分子在目前只是小丑跳梁，是整个蒋介石匪帮临死挣扎中的回光返照，不必大惊小怪，更不要“草木皆兵”，只要注意起来，进行必要的工作，是可以防患于未然，消弭于无形的。
    保卫工厂是我们整个保卫工作中的重要任务之一。保卫工厂主要依靠全体工人阶级的觉悟，应该教育工人阶级，认识工厂是自己与全体人民的宝贵财产，爱惜它，保护它，不容许任何人进行丝毫的破坏。工人阶级是容易懂得这种道理的。他们在工厂作工，依靠工厂生活，他们把机器看作自己的生命。当着他们进一步认识到自己已经作了公营工厂的主人，和私营工厂也有血肉不可分离的关系的时候，他们的积极性会空前提高，想出许多切合具体要求的办法，这一真理也已为北平许多工厂的事实所证明。
    许多工厂依靠工人组织了纠察队，专门担负保卫工厂的责任，已经证明颇有成效，应该继续推行。经验证明：纠察队应启发工人自动组成，切忌流于形式，即应经过自动报名、群众公议的步骤，选择热忱忠实精明强干的分子担任。领导上要对他们随时施以必要的教育，使其能胜任愉快地进行工作。同时，应该适当地照顾他们，不要使他们过度疲劳，致影响其工作和休息。有些工人自动加班巡逻，不要加班费，这种热情是好的，但从领导上讲，则应该注意这一点，从其他方面加以照顾，使他们这种热情能够饱满地坚持下去，达成保卫人民工厂的神圣任务。
