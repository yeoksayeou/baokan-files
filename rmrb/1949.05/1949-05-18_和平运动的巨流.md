　　Editorial Postscript

　　The Torrent of the Peace Movement
    The entire German people, regardless of class, belief, or regional restrictions, are organizing on a large scale to oppose the divided state, demand the convening of a national conference, and strive to establish a peaceful, democratic, and unified country! This, in the current situation, is a massive torrent in the world's movement to defend peace!
    For the four years since the war, most of the world has been plunged into extreme chaos and unease due to American imperialism's wanton aggression, deployment of military bases, and interference in other countries' internal affairs, reaching its peak with the signing of the North Atlantic aggressive treaty! However, simultaneously with American imperialism's aggression, the peace-loving camp headed by the Soviet Union has also made magnificent progress. The World Peace Congress was held simultaneously in Paris and Prague, demonstrating the world's people's firm will to defend peace and the unparalleled power of organized strength. Following the Peace Congress, the peace movements in various countries are also rising like a storm. Faced with the massive peace movement, this small group of warmongers feels embarrassed! They have had to extend an olive branch, and the key to a hopeful and reasonable solution to the German question lies in this!

　　和平运动的巨流
    全德人民，不分阶层、信仰、区域的限制，正大规模地组织起来，反对分裂状态，要求召开全国会议，争取建立和平民主统一的国家！这在当前来说是世界保卫和平运动中的一支巨流！
    战后四年来的大半个世界因美帝的肆意侵略、布署军事基地、干涉他国内政而陷入极度的混乱与不安中，到北大西洋侵略公约的订立而达顶点！但与美帝侵略同时，以苏联为首的爱好和平阵营也有了壮阔的进展，世界拥护和平大会在巴黎及布拉格同时召开，显示出世界人民保卫和平的坚强意志与组织力量的无比威力。继和平大会之后，各国的保卫和平运动也正风起云涌，在巨大的和平运动面前，这一小撮战争贩子们感到狼狈了！他们不得不伸出和解的手，德国问题能够有希望合理解决，其关键便在此！
