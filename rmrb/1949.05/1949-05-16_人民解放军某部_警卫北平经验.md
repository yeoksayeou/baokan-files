Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, May 15th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army, which won unanimous praise from the people for guarding Beiping, has the following experiences in guarding large cities:

(1) The main guarantee for implementing urban policies and discipline is to carry out policy and discipline education to improve the political awareness of the entire unit. When guarding large cities, the troops are stationed in scattered locations, the tasks are huge and complex, and the social situation is complex. The troops are also unfamiliar with these situations. Only by relying on the entire unit's high degree of conscious compliance with policies and discipline can we avoid being corrupted by the decadent life left over from the old society in the city and truly achieve not violating the interests of the people in the slightest. Before entering the city, the unit repeatedly conducted policy and discipline education. All personnel, without exception, reflected on and reviewed their past experiences, universally took oaths, and formulated a convention to ensure mutual adherence to discipline. All companies and directly subordinate agencies and units conducted democratic discussions and strictly assessed the qualifications of each cadre and soldier to enter the city. This series of work created a mass movement of observing discipline in the army, making everyone realize that "entering the city to perform guard duties is to appear in front of the urban people as representatives of the Communist Party and the Liberation Army, which is a political issue related to the political influence of the entire Party and the entire army"; "The Party's policies and discipline belong to each of us and must not be violated." Therefore, during the two and a half months of guarding, the unit not only completed its tasks but also produced a large number of examples.

(2) The combination of the adherence to principles by leading organs at all levels, mutual supervision by soldiers and the masses, and the exemplary role of cadres is the organizational guarantee for implementing guard duties. The Communist Party committees at all levels in the unit not only frequently emphasized the importance of policies and discipline but also studied the difficulties and problems encountered by subordinates in their work at any time, regularly reviewed and summarized, and continuously corrected deviations. At the same time, based on the characteristics of decentralized guard duty, the unit appropriately allocated troops and adjusted cadres. Responsible cadres at all levels also showed a high degree of responsibility and exemplary role. In the early days of entering the city, they often stayed up late to check and understand the situation in various companies, giving the soldiers a good influence. The soldiers encouraged each other, saying: We must not be sloppy, so as not to cause the leaders to worry too much. The mutual supervision and inspection of the soldiers also played a huge role in the entire army's implementation of policies and discipline in a decentralized environment.

(3) Actively check and supervise, oppose the bureaucratic work style of being satisfied with the general estimate that "generally speaking, it is still better," and focus on commending the good and criticizing the bad, with commendation as the main focus, to prevent the phenomenon of being strict at first and then slackening. During the guard period, the unit conducted three major inspections, namely, the mass discipline inspection after entering the city, the inspection of guarding warehouses, and the discipline inspection before leaving Beiping for the southern expedition. In the inspection, work such as compensation, apology, and explanation was carried out, which further strengthened the relationship between the army and the people and local party and government, and the army's mass concept and policy discipline concept also improved.

(4) Guarding warehouses with emphasis can save troops and prevent sabotage. When guarding, strict procedures should be followed, stand firm, and not be swayed by emotions. All agencies and departments must have certificates and receipts when transporting materials. At the same time, it is also necessary to maintain close contact with the responsible comrades sent by the military control committee to various warehouses, agencies, and factories to prevent certain bad elements from forging false certificates and fraudulently claiming materials. When transferring warehouses, detailed inspection, registration, and handover should be carried out to clarify responsibilities. Because all units of the unit have always maintained this serious attitude of being loyal to their duties, they have ensured that all state properties under their guard have not been lost or wasted. During the two and a half months of guard work, the unit not only enhanced the reputation of the People's Liberation Army but also increased the urban knowledge of all officers and soldiers and gained a lot of experience in managing cities, further recognizing the Party's urban policy and industrial and commercial policies. At the same time, because the entry into the city for guard duty was prepared and trained, it was possible to prevent the ideas of peaceful enjoyment that might occur when entering large cities in advance, naturally combining with political rectification, laying the ideological foundation for the march to the south of the Yangtze River, and enabling the unit to start the southern expedition with full morale after completing the guard task.

### 人民解放军某部　警卫北平经验

　　人民解放军某部
  　警卫北平经验
    【新华社北平十五日电】警卫北平博得人民同声赞扬的人民解放军某部，对警备大城市有如下几点经验：
    （一）执行城市政策纪律的主要保证，是贯彻政策纪律教育，提高整个部队的政治认识。警备大城市时，部队驻地分散，任务庞杂，而社会情况复杂，部队对这些情况又很生疏，只有依靠整个部队高度地自觉地遵守政策纪律，才能免除为城市中旧社会遗留的靡烂生活所腐蚀，真正做到秋毫无犯。该部在入城前即反复进行了政策纪律教育，各种人员都无例外地联系过去进行反省检讨，普遍地进行宣誓，制定互相保证坚决遵守纪律的公约。各连队和各直属队机关单位都进行了民主讨论，严格评定每个干部战士的入城资格。这一系列的工作，在部队中造成了群众性的遵守纪律运动，使大家认识到“入城执行警备任务是作为共产党和解放军的代表而出现在城市人民的面前，是关系全党全军的政治影响问题”；“党的政策纪律就是我们每个人自己的，绝对不能违犯”。因此该部在两个半月的警卫时期，不仅完成了任务，并涌现了大批的范例。
    （二）各级领导机关坚持原则，战士群众互相监督和干部的模范作用，这三方面的结合，是贯彻执行警备任务的组织保证。该部各级的共产党委员会不但经常强调政策纪律的重要性，而且随时研究下级在工作中碰到的困难和发生的问题，定期检讨总结，不断纠正偏差。同时根据分散警备的特点，曾适当地配备了部队与调整了干部。各级负责干部也表现了高度的责任心和模范作用。初入城时，常常晚上不睡觉，到各个连队检查和了解情况，给战士们以良好的影响，战士们都互相鼓励：不能马虎一点，免得首长多操心。战士们的互相督促检查，也对全军在分散环境中，执行政策纪律起了巨大作用。
    （三）积极检查督促，反对满足于“一般说来还较好”的笼统估计的官僚主义作风，抓紧表扬好的，批评坏的，并以表扬为主，防止先紧后松的现象。该部在警备期间曾先后进行了三次大检查，即入城后的群众纪律检查，看守仓库的检查和离平南征前的纪律检查。在检查中进行了赔偿道歉、解释等工作，使军队与人民及地方党政关系进一步地密切起来，部队的群众观念和政策纪律观念也随着提高了一步。
    （四）有重点地看守仓库，既可以节省兵力，又可以防止破坏。在看守时应当严密手续，站稳立场，不受感情拉拢。各机关部门前来搬运物资时必须持有证件与留交收据。同时还要与军管会派到各仓库、机关、工厂的负责同志保持密切联系，防止某些坏分子私造假证件，冒领物资。在移交仓库时要详细检查登记点交，明确责任。由于该部各单位始终保持这种忠于职守的严肃态度，保证了所有看守的国家财产没有受到损失和浪费。两个半月的警备工作，该部不仅提高了人民解放军的声誉，而且增进了全军指战员的城市知识，获得了许多管理城市的经验，进一步地认识了党的城市政策和工商业政策。同时由于此次入城警备有准备有训练，因此能够预先防止进入大城市时可能发生的和平享乐思想，很自然地结合着政治整训，奠定了进军江南的思想基础，使该部在完成警备任务后，能够以饱满的士气开始南征。
