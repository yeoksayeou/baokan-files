　　Implementing the Kaogong System
  　Increased Production and Savings
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegraph] The Henan Printing Factory of the Ji-Lu-Yu Xinhua Bookstore has achieved great results by implementing the Kaogong (Assessment of Work) system. In order to improve technology, save materials, and evaluate grades according to the workers' enthusiasm and contributions, all factory employees began implementing the Kaogong system in April. In the typesetting room, work was previously calculated on a weekly basis, with an average of 1,200 characters set per hour; since the implementation of Kaogong, this has increased by 200 to 400 characters. The number of errors has also been significantly reduced. The work in the binding room was often chaotic in the past, and there were missing or incorrect pages. After the implementation of Kaogong, everyone conscientiously checked past shortcomings, and technicians led workers in training through division of labor. Gradually, all work became regularized. In terms of savings, the material section alone has achieved the following: (1) More than 1,000 reams of "mao tou" (inferior quality) paper accumulated in the past. This time, after sorting it out, partly through exchange and partly through sale, more than 660 reams of good paper were obtained in return. (2) Coal briquette residue was always treated as waste in the past, but this time it was also collected and sold for 2.9 million catties. For a time, production savings became a factory-wide upsurge.

　　实行考工制
  　增产又节约
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫新华书店河南印书厂实行考工制度，已获得极大成绩。为着提高技术，节约材料，并按工人们工作的积极和供献的多少以评等级，全厂职工于四月起开始实行考工制度。排字房的工作，过去以周计，平均每小时能排一千二百字；考工以来，增加二百字至四百字。错字也减低不少。装订房的工作，过去常现紊乱，书页也有缺错，实行考工以后，大家都认真检查过去的缺点，并由技师带工人，在分工中进行培养，逐渐地一切工作都入正规，在节约上，仅材料股就有：（一）从前的毛头纸积累下一千余刀，这一次拣出来，连换带卖，就换回六百六十余刀好纸来；（二）木炭挤子过去一向就当废物，这次也收集起来，卖了二百九十万斤；一时生产节约成为全厂的热潮。
