　　【Chahar News】Since the beginning of spring this year, gambling has occurred in many villages in Wan County. Although the government explicitly prohibited it, and the security guards went to various districts to arrest people, they still couldn't stop it. When the spring plowing started, these people were still gathering at night and dispersing in the morning, sleeping during the day, and gambling at night, not engaging in production. Some went to the mountains. Due to the above situation, social order was chaotic, and thefts occurred continuously. In Qigezhuang Village, Third District, thieves were constantly being chased at night, and the masses were worried about their belongings all day long, fearing they would be stolen. Since January, according to incomplete statistics, there have been 25 cases of theft (livestock, grain, clothing). Where gambling is serious, there are more thefts. In order to eliminate this illegal activity, stabilize social order, the County Public Security Bureau specially organized a short-term gambler training class to eliminate gambling and enable these elements to engage in production. The districts collected statistics on all non-productive gamblers who only gambled, and then submitted them to the County Bureau for review, totaling 75 people. Training began on April 29.

　　The educational methods used mostly conversational approaches and practical examples, finding well-performing gamblers for individual education, and cultivating them into backbones, to inspire everyone, explaining that gambling is a feudal toxin of the old society and cannot be brought into the new society.

　　After several days of education and reform, they all confessed to the government, wanting to turn over a new leaf. For example, Su Deshan (poor peasant) from Wangguzhuang, gambled away the fruits of victory he had been allocated during the land redistribution. Later, he gambled away one dou of corn earned by his wife spinning thread out of two dou. Wang Gouer from Wangjiazhuang also gambled away his daughter to someone else. After confessing, they all resolved to change. At the end of the seven-day training, except for five key figures who were handed over to the government for sentencing, the general ones all swore oaths, wrote repentance letters, and found village cadres to guarantee their release, reformed and returned home to engage in production peacefully. After these gamblers returned to their villages, they publicized the evils of gambling to the masses and handed over the gambling paraphernalia they knew to the government. For example, Sun Chunyuan said: "I not only guarantee that I won't do it again, but also guarantee that the whole village won't." Now the social order in Wan County is more stable than before, gambling is gradually eliminated, and this group of people has also participated in production, increasing productivity.

　　The masses in various villages strongly support the government's actions. The children, wives, and elderly in the gamblers' families praised it even more. Some said, "Why didn't the government do this earlier!" Some wives pointed out, "Still gambling? Is your hand still itching? Finally, someone is controlling you! Otherwise, you would have become monsters!"

　　赌徒决心生产
  　社会秩序改进
  　完县改造赌徒获成绩
    【察哈尔讯】今春以来，完县不少村发生赌博现象，政府虽明文制止，警卫队也到各区抓捕，但也没有制止住。春耕开始，这一批人仍然是夜聚明散白天睡觉，黑夜耍钱，不闹生产。有的地方到山沟里去。由于以上情况，造成了社会秩序的混乱，偷盗事情不断发生。三区齐各庄村，晚上不断追贼，群众整日惦记自己的东西，怕被贼偷去。自一月份以来据不完全的统计，发生偷盗案件即有二十五起（牲口、粮食、衣裳。）哪片赌博严重，哪片发生偷盗事件较多。为了达到消灭这一不法活动，安定社会秩序，县公安局特召开了一个短期赌棍训练班，消灭赌博现象，使这些分子从事生产。各区把所有不生产、光耍钱的赌棍进行统计，然后交到县局审查，共七十五人，四月二十九日开始训练。
    教育的方法多是用漫谈的方式和举实际例子，找出表现好的赌棍个别教育，培养成骨干，以启发大家，说明赌博是旧社会封建的毒素，不能把它带到新社会里来。
    经过几天的教育改造，都向政府坦白，要痛改前非，如王谷庄苏德山（贫农），平分时分给他的胜利果实也卖掉给输了去，后把他老婆纺线赚的二斗玉米也输了一斗。王家庄王狗儿把闺女也输给人家，经坦白后，都下定了决心要改。七天练训结束，除五名首要分子交政府判处外，一般的都宣誓写悔过书，找村干部具结出保，改过回家安心生产。这批赌棍回村以后，向群众宣传赌博之坏处，把自己所知道的赌牌也交给政府。如孙春元说：我不光保证我不来，还保证全村不要。现在完县的社会秩序较前安定，赌博亦逐渐消灭，这一批人也参加了生产，增加了生产力。
    各村群众都很拥护政府这样作，赌棍家里孩子、妻子、老人更赞扬，有的说：“政府有这个办法为何不早办呢！”有的家里老婆指点说：“还赌呗？手还痒痒不？到底有人管住你们唠，要不管你们还成了精哩！”
