    Suzhou People's Municipal Government Established
    Nanjing Stops Redemption of Counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates
    [Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 9th Dispatch: All departments under the Suzhou Military Control Commission are proceeding with the takeover work in an orderly manner according to their respective systems. The Military Control Commission was established on the 30th of last month, with Wei Guoqing as the director. The Suzhou People's Municipal Government and the Suzhou Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have also been established, with Wei Guoqing as the mayor and secretary of the municipal party committee, Wu Ming as the deputy mayor, and Lin Xiude as the deputy secretary of the municipal party committee. The order in Suzhou is now stable, schools are operating as usual, and shops have opened for business.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates have ceased circulation in Nanjing. After the Military Control Commission issued a public notice on the 28th of last month, setting a deadline and quota for the redemption of counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates, the Nanjing Branch of the People's Bank of China posted daily adjustments to the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates, and gradually redeemed them. However, due to the rapid devaluation of the counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates, they are now virtually worthless waste paper and cannot be used even in areas still under the control of the remnant forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Therefore, Nanjing citizens automatically refused to use the counterfeit currency on the afternoon of the 4th, and the People's Bank of China issued a notice on the 5th to stop redeeming the counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates.

    苏州人民市政府成立
    南京停兑伪金元券
    【北平新华广播电台广播】南京九号消息：苏州军事管制委员会所属各部正按系统有秩序的进行接管工作。该军管委会是在上月三十号成立，韦国清为主任。苏州市人民政府和中共苏州市委员会也已经成立，韦国清为市长兼市委书记，吴明为副市长，林休德为市委副书记。现在苏州市秩序安定，学校照常上课，商店已经开门营业。
    【新华社南京九日电】南京市内伪金圆券已停止流通。上月二十八日军事管制委员会布告限期限额收兑伪金圆券后，人民银行南京分行即逐日挂牌调整人民币与伪金圆券的比价，陆续收兑。但由于伪金圆券急剧贬值，实际上已等于一文不值的废纸，即在国民党匪帮残余势力统治的地区也已不能行使，故南京市民于四日下午即自动拒用伪币，人民银行则于五日通告停止收兑伪金圆券。
