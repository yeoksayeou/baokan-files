　　Saving manpower, material resources, and time
  　Ji'nan changes from conscripting labor to hiring vehicles
    [Ji'nan Electric Dispatch] In order to save manpower, material resources, and time to complete the task of supporting the front lines, the Ji'nan Logistics Command has changed from conscripting labor to hiring vehicles (except in the case of war at the front). In the past, due to the lack of precise calculation for conscripted labor in some areas, there were many instances of wasted manpower and material resources, which has attracted the attention of logistics departments at all levels since September of last year. After five months of experimentation, hiring vehicles saves more manpower and material resources and also saves time compared to conscripting labor. Taking the transportation of clothing from ××× to ×× in February as an example, the journey was approximately 150 li, and the weight of the clothing was 55,616 jin. Mostly rubber-wheeled mule and horse carts were hired, with each cart carrying about 2,500 jin, traveling more than 100 li per day, costing a total of 55,616 yuan RMB, equivalent to 4,634 jin of millet. If calculated based on conscripting labor, each double-ox cart could carry 1,000 jin and travel 60 li per day, requiring 56 carts. Each cart needed eight days (five days for round trip, three days for loading, unloading, and gathering). In total, it would take 448 cart-days. This year, each cart was compensated with 22 jin of millet per day, totaling 9,856 jin of millet. Thus, hiring vehicles saved 5,222 jin of millet compared to conscripting labor, and the task was completed five days earlier.

　　节省人力物力时间
  　冀南改支差为雇车
    【冀南电】为节省人力、物力和时间，完成支援前线任务，冀南后勤司令部，改支差为雇车办法（前方战争例外）。以往，由于某些地区对支差工作，缺乏精确计算，曾发生不少浪费人力物力现象，自去年九月已引起各级后勤部门注意。经过五个月的试验，雇车比支差既省人力物力，又省时间。仅以二月份由×××到××运被服一项计算，路途约一五○里，被服重量五五六一六斤，雇的多是胶轮骡马大车，每辆载重在二五零零斤左右，每日行程百里以上，共用运费五五六一六元人民币，折米四六三四斤，如按支差计算，每辆双牛大车载重一零零零斤。每日行程六十里。需用车五十六辆。每一辆需八天时间（往返五天，装车，卸车，集合三天）。总计需用车四四八天，今年支差每日每车小米二十二斤，共需米九八五六斤。如此，雇车支省差比米五二二二斤，时间提前完成五天。
