　　Taihang Sowing Brief
Since mid-April (around the Grain Rain solar term), some areas of Taihang have begun sowing successively. On April 25th, the entire area experienced widespread rainfall, but the amount was small. Under the active call and leadership of party members, cadres, and heroic models, farmers everywhere universally carried water to combat drought and sow after the rain. As of early May, according to incomplete statistics from 144 villages in 18 counties including Wu'an, Neiqiu, and Changzhi, over 200,000 mu of various crops such as cotton, peanuts, millet, beans, corn, sorghum, yams, turnips, buckwheat, and spring vegetables have been sown. The sowing campaign has been universally launched throughout the area. In promoting the development of this sowing campaign, various localities have gained several main experiences, such as ideological mobilization, timely and specific leadership, sufficient prior preparation, and rational organization and arrangement of labor and livestock. On the night of the rainfall, the Shahe County government urgently instructed each district by telephone to immediately organize sowing after the rain, especially emphasizing the need to plant cotton in a timely manner. Some villagers were concerned that the rainfall was too light and the seeds would not sprout. District and village cadres and party members promptly proposed slogans such as "Seize the afternoon to plant to save labor, waiting for it to dry will cost more labor," and personally took the lead in carrying water to plant cotton, sparking a mass cotton planting movement. After the rainfall, cadres from the Second District of Anyang went to the villages separately to mobilize and organize, and at the same time, specifically solve difficulties, enabling 31 villages in the entire district to plant over 10,000 mu of cotton in two days. After the rainfall in the Eighth and Ninth Districts of Anyang, it was during our army's siege of Anyang, and the task of supporting the front was heavy. For example, only one donkey remained in the entire village of Shi Fanliu. In this situation of severe shortage of labor and livestock, the slogan "Men and women work together" was put forward, promoting the sowing campaign throughout the area. Villages such as Beipo in Changzhi effectively organized various labor forces, with old men, children, and women holding plows, leading livestock, and scattering seeds, while young and strong men carried water and spread manure, making life complete quickly and well. When the sowing season arrived, Jieban Village in Pingshun specifically restored the Technical Committee and mobilized the masses to adjust and exchange varieties in large quantities. Some villages in Licheng carried out warm water soaking and floatation to remove unfilled seeds.

　　太行播种简报
    四月中旬（即谷雨节前后）以来，太行部分地区已先后下种；四月二十五日，全区普遍下雨，但量很小，各地农民在党员、干部、英雄模范等的积极号召与带领下，普遍担水防旱雨后播种，截至五月初根据武安、内邱、长治等十八个县一百四十四个村的不完全统计，已下种棉花、花生、谷、豆、玉茭、高粱、山药、蔓菁、荞麦、春菜等各种作物二十余万亩。全区播种运动，已普遍展开。各地在推动此次下种运动的开展时，取得了思想发动，及时的具体领导，事先充分准备，劳畜力的合理组织与安排等几个主要经验。沙河县府于落雨之夜，紧急在电话上分别指示各区立即组织雨后下种，特别指出应时植棉。部分村群众因雨量较小，怕种上出不来，区村干部党员即及时提出：“趁晌抢种能省工、再等地干越费工”等口号，并亲自带头担水点种，掀起群众性的点棉运动。安阳二区干部于落雨后即分途下乡，一面动员组织，一面具体解决困难，使全区三十一个村两天种棉万余亩。安阳八、九区落雨后，正是我军围攻安阳之际，支前任务繁重，如师蕃流全村仅留一头毛驴。在这种劳畜力严重缺乏的情况下，提出：“男女齐动手”的口号，推动了全区的下种运动。长治北坡等村，有效的组织各种劳力，老汉儿童妇女捉犁牵牲口溜种籽，青壮男劳力担水撒粪，使生活完成又快又好。平顺界畔＠村于下种季节到来时，特别恢复了技术委员会，并发动群众大量调茬换种；黎城部分村进行温汤浸种，漂种去秕。
