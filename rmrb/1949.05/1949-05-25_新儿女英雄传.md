　　Chapter One: The Incident
　　The cannons roar,
　　Tears fill the eyes.
　　—Folksong
　　I
　　Niu Dashui was twenty-one, and still hadn't married a wife.
　　His mother had already passed away, and there was only his old father and a younger brother at home. Without a woman around, life was really hard!
　　The old father often thought about finding a wife for Dashui, but Dashui said, "How can we afford to marry her?" The old father said, "There's no other way, we'll borrow some more money from Shen Yaozong." As soon as he heard about borrowing money, Dashui got anxious. Since the year his mother died, they had borrowed sixty silver dollars from Shen Yaozong, using their five mu of reeds as collateral. Every year, the interest just kept piling up, like thrashing about in a well, neither dying nor living. Dashui said, "Hey, it's already bad enough! If we borrow more, even these pitiful five mu of land will have to wear a halter!" The old father said, "Son, if I don't get you a wife, I won't be able to rest in peace when I die! Let's grit our teeth, get you a wife, and then work our butts off to pay off the debt, okay?" But Dashui didn't agree. This fine young man, tall and strong, with broad shoulders and thick arms, was most capable. He always worked from dawn till dusk, hoping to live a life without owing anyone, before settling down and getting married.

　　This year, it was right after the July 7th Incident. The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge thundered, and could be heard clearly on the levee. People were panicking. This village was called Shenjia Village, next to Baiyang Lake. Ten li away, there was a large village called He Village. The sub-bureau in He Village received orders from the troops to requisition laborers from each village, to go west and dig trenches and build fortifications; Niu Dashui also went. The police in the bureau were quite ruthless, hitting people at the slightest provocation. Dashui's shaved head also took a few blows. They toiled day and night for more than a month. But as soon as the fortifications were finished, the troops retreated with a whoosh, looting and robbing along the way, causing a great disturbance. The fortifications were all for nothing. The bureau also dissolved itself. Soon, Baoding fell. Japanese planes flew overhead every day, and several bombs fell on the city. The high-ranking officials fled with gold and silver, and the lower-ranking officials packed up and ran.

　　The villagers were even more panicked. As soon as Niu Dashui returned from the fields, he went to the village office to inquire about news. In the courtyard of the village office, many villagers were standing, eagerly listening to the village chief, Shen Yaozong, and the gentry discussing important matters in the north room. Those wealthy people were so scared that they were at a loss for words. Some said, "Let's run! Don't stick our necks out waiting to die." Others said, "What about our family property? We should see which way the wind blows first." Truly, everyone was anxious, with a knot in their hearts.

　　The next day, the refugees came down, walking past in a chaotic stream of tears. Dashui's father and two brothers were still sowing wheat. This wheat field was rented. They didn't have livestock, so the two brothers had to pull the seed drill in front, while the old father held the seed box in the back. The younger brother was small, so Dashui did most of the pulling; this strong young man was like an ox, pulling with great effort. The refugees watched and sighed, "Alas, what time is it? You're still sowing wheat! Do you think you'll be able to eat it?" Dashui was also panicked in his heart. He stopped, straightened up, and said to his father, "Really, sowing is useless. If we don't run, we're as good as dead!" The old father glared at him and said, "Run where? Pull your seed drill! It's better to die, but if we don't die, we still have to live."

　　Later, more and more refugees came. Relatives from Dashui's cousin's family also fled to their home; it was his cousin's mother and younger sister. Their home was near Baoding, and it was already dark when they arrived here. The old woman sat on the kang, patting her leg and saying, "We can't live anymore! How can we survive these days? Defeated soldiers, bandits, tossing and turning... How can we mother and daughter escape this disaster! Your younger sister is grown up, we need to find her a husband soon, so I can worry less. Right now, being orphans and widows is really a hardship!" She cried as she spoke.

　　A few days later, the cousin came to Dashui's house, wanting to propose her younger sister, Yang Xiaomei, to Niu Dashui. When Dashui's father heard this, he smiled, his face full of wrinkles, his mouth unable to close, saying, "That's too good! Our family's circumstances aren't great, we'll just see if your mother is willing." Niu Dashui mumbled, "In this day and age, still getting married!" But in his heart, he was overjoyed. Before, Yang Xiaomei often came to her sister's house and Dashui would often meet her, and they had spoken. Yang Xiaomei was pretty, could do any kind of work, and was kind at heart. Once, Dashui took some work to ask his cousin to do, but his cousin was too busy, so Xiaomei silently took it and did it. At this moment, Dashui thought in his heart: "Xiaomei is really good! If I marry her as my wife, I'll be satisfied for the rest of my life."

　　The cousin knew that Dashui was willing, spoke a few words to his father, and went back to discuss it with her mother. Xiaomei was sitting on the kang doing needlework. She was seventeen this year; although she wasn't tall, she was very strong. She could usually carry a full bucket of water and walk quickly. Her mother was an old-fashioned person, and still had her keep a thick braid, with bangs on her forehead. At this moment, she raised her big eyes and saw her sister smiling at her, speaking softly to her mother. She knew they were talking about her marriage, so she shyly blushed, lowered her head, pretended to do needlework, not looking or speaking, but her ears were listening intently. She thought to herself: "Dashui is really good! A good young man, honest and kind. If I can find such a caring farmer, I will be content for the rest of my life." Who knew that her mother didn't dislike anything about Dashui, except that his family was poor. She couldn't make up her mind for a while, and said, "Let's discuss this marriage slowly."

　　Dashui's cousin had long left home. Originally, he was a blacksmith, but secretly joined the Communist Party, and opened a restaurant, engaging in transportation and sheltering revolutionary comrades who came and went. Later, the bureau "suppressed the Communists," arresting people everywhere. He couldn't stay at home, so he went out. The cousin wove mats and baskets year-round, supporting the family. Her mother saw that she was having a hard time, stayed for a few days, and then took Xiaomei to her grandmother's house. Xiaomei's grandmother's house was not far away, in Dayang Village in Baiyang Lake. This marriage was left undecided.

　　II

　　After autumn, the bandits became rampant. Many villages in this area had bandits, each with their own number. There was a small bandit in Shenjia Village named Li Liuzi. Li Liuzi had one gun and five men. He called the village chief, Shen Yaozong, and said, "What's going on? Other villages have all established 'national designations.' If we don't establish a group in our village, I won't be responsible if others come and eat us!" Shen Yaozong saw that he was wickedly formidable. The security forces under his command had all run away, and he was somewhat afraid, so he obeyed.

　　That afternoon, they gathered people in the courtyard of the family temple to speak. Dashui's father and two brothers also went. They saw Li Liuzi holding a "louzi" (handgun), stepping onto the steps and saying, "I have something to tell everyone. Right now, everywhere is establishing 'cook groups,' each village protecting its own village. Our village also needs to establish a group, and just eat from this village. In this day and age, we can't distinguish between yours and mine. Whoever wants to come can come. This is called 'sharing!'" Saying that, he walked down, took out a box of British-brand cigarettes, and shouted, "Let's share!" and divided the cigarettes. Immediately, a large pot was set up in the courtyard of the family temple, and a large kang was set up in the house. The "Shenjia Gang" was established.

　　Dashui's father was very angry when he saw this. He twisted his neck, pulled Dashui and left, saying as they walked, "These people are just causing trouble. Let's go home and work!" As soon as they got home, a guy named Xiao Xiaozi came to find Dashui to discuss joining. Niu Dashui honestly said, "No, our family has never produced such a person. People will say we're evil!" Xiao Xiaozi went alone.

　　At this time, the Japanese devils were heading south on the railway line to the west, and they could still breathe a sigh of relief here. Dashui's family went to cut reeds. The father and two sons got on a small boat, and the twelve-year-old Niu Xiaoshui skillfully rowed the boat half a li away; they came to the reed marshes of Baiyang Lake. Two sharpened sickles were dipped into the clear water to cut reeds. Not watching the geese flying in the sky, nor listening to the ducks and moorhens calling, Dashui kept thinking about Yang Xiaomei. She was also in the lake, how was her marriage? Who knew that Xiaomei couldn't resist her mother, and her mother had promised her to someone else! She was already engaged. The man was named Zhang Jinlong, and lived in He Village, not far from Dashui's house. Dashui didn't know! When the sun was about to set, the water surface was a red glow, dazzling. Their boat, loaded with reeds, was heavy and slow, and the two brothers laboriously rowed back to the levee. After carrying all the reeds ashore, it was already dark, and the moon was high in the trees.

　　In these few days, He Village also established the "He Village Gang", and the setup was much bigger. The leader, He Shixiong, was a member of the Kuomintang, had served as a chief of staff in the Central Army, and had fifty qing of good land, and many guns and men. Zhang Jinlong, who was engaged to Xiaomei, was originally a "bodyguard" in He Shixiong's house, and also joined the "He Village Gang", and became a small leader. In addition, some scattered soldiers and some policemen also joined. Li Liuzi and the bandits in the nearby area were afraid of not being able to hold out, so they all went to join them. The "He Village Gang" became even more overbearing and started to eat more. They asked each village for things every day; eight hundred catties of flour, eight hundred catties of meat, oil and vinegar... Everything was eight hundred catties. The people said: "Eight hundred catties, eight hundred catties, skinned and sinewed!" They also wanted money, assessed according to households, one hundred and twenty-eighty each. Dashui's family had just given Shen Yaozong the interest from the reeds, and had to pay the fee with the remaining amount.

　　The day after Dashui's family paid the fee, Zhang Jinlong rode a big mule, carrying a box gun, and ran to Shenjia Village to recruit people. He saw Niu Dashui carrying a manure basket picking up manure, so he reined in the mule, tilted his head, revealed a gold tooth, and said with a smile, "Heh, silly boy! What are you doing that for? Come with me to eat white flour buns stewed with pork." Dashui recognized him, and was so anxious that sweat dripped from his shaved head. He said, "We, we can't, we don't have that kind of ability!" Zhang Jinlong widened his eyes: "What? 'No ability!' You don't know how to eat pork and white flour?" Dashui was stumped by his question, lowered his head, and randomly shoveled a piece of manure into the manure basket, and walked away. Zhang Jinlong looked down on him with a face full of contempt, and glanced at him sideways, saying: "Scare, your parents didn't raise you well! You have your eyes in your crotch!" Then he kicked the mule, gave it a light lash, and ran away. Dashui was so angry that he glared, watching him go far away. 【Note】

　　Niu Dashui said: "Sowing is also useless! If we don't run, we're as good as dead!"
　　The old father said, "Run where? It's better to die, but if we don't die, we still have to live!"
　　Yang Xiaomei knew they were talking about her marriage, pretended to be working, but listened with her ears.
　　Zhang Jinlong called Niu Dashui to join the gang, but Dashui didn't go.
　　Zhang Jinlong scolded him: "Your parents didn't raise you well!"

    第一回　事变
    炮声一响，
    眼泪满眶。
    ——民谣
    一
    牛大水二十一了，还没娶媳妇。
    他娘已经去世，家里只有老爹和一个小兄弟，没个娘们家，过日子真难啊！
    老爹常想给大水娶个媳妇，可是大水说：“咱们使什么娶呀？”老爹说：“没办法，再跟申耀宗借些钱儿吧。”一听说借钱，大水就急了。自从娘死那一年，指着五亩苇子地，借了申耀宗六十块现大洋，年年打利打不清，就象掉到井里打扑腾，死不死，活不活的。大水说：“咳，还不够瞧的！要再借，剩下这可怜巴巴的五亩地，也得戴上笼头啦！”老爹说：“小子，不给你娶媳妇，我死也不合眼！咱们咬咬牙，娶过媳妇来，再跳打着还帐不行啊？”大水可不同意。这好小伙子，长得挺壮实，宽肩膀，粗胳膊，最能干活；总是熬星星，熬月亮，想熬个不短人、不欠人的，松松心儿再娶媳妇。
    这一年，正赶上七七事变。芦沟桥的炮声咚咚响，在堤上听得很真的。人们都惊慌起来了。这村名叫申家庄，在白洋淀旁边。离这儿十里地，有个大村叫何庄；何庄有个三分局，局子里接了队伍的命令，向各庄要夫子，开到西边去，挖战壕、作工事；牛大水也去了。局子里的警察挺横，动不动就打人，大水的光脑瓜儿上也挨了几棍子；这么黑间白日的修了一个多月。谁知刚修好，队伍就哗的退下来；一路抢人劫道，闹得很凶。工事白搭了。局子也自动的散了摊儿。不久，保定失守。日本飞机天天来头上转，城里掉了几个蛋；大官们携金带银，小官们拔锅卷席的，都跑光了。
    村里人们更惊慌了。牛大水下地一回来，就到村公所探听消息。公所的大院子里，有好些老乡站着，眼巴巴的听北屋里村长申耀宗和士绅们商量大事。那些有钱人吓得文字眼儿也没有了，有的说：“跑吧！别伸着脖子等死。”有的说：“丢下家业怎么办？不如看看风势再说。”真是人心惶惶，谁心里也纠着一疙瘩啊。
    第二天，逃难的下来了，流着泪，纷纷乱乱的走过。大水爷儿三个还在耩麦子①呢。这麦地是租来的。他们没有牲口，只好弟兄俩在前面拉着，老爹在后面掌褛②。兄弟年纪小，那么重的耩，全靠大水拉；大水这壮小伙子，可真象条牛似的，拉得怪起劲儿。逃难的人们瞧着，叹气说：“唉，这是什么时候呀，你们还有麦子！估摸能吃上啊？”大水心里也慌了。他站住脚，直起腰来，对老爹说：“真是，耩也是白耩。要不跑，怎么也是个死！”老爹瞪着他说：“跑哪儿去？快拉你的种式③吧！死了倒好，死不了总得过呀。”
    以后逃难的越来越多，大水的表哥家里，也逃来了亲戚；是表嫂的娘和妹子。她们的家在保定附近，逃到这儿已经上灯了。那老婆儿坐在炕上，拍着腿说：“可活不了啦！这日子怎么过呀？败兵，土匪，折腾来，折腾去……咱娘儿俩可怎么躲过这个灾呀！你妹子也大了，要早早寻个主，我也少操些心。眼下孤儿寡妇的，真叫人遭难啊！”说说她就哭了。
    过了几天，表嫂到大水家来，想把她妹子杨小梅说给牛大水。大水他爹一听，就笑得满脸皱纹，嘴都合不拢了，说：“这可太好么！我们家光景不强，只看你娘愿意不愿意啦。”牛大水嘴里含含糊糊的说：“这年头，还娶媳妇！”心里可是滚上滚下的了。以前杨小梅常来她姊姊家住大水和她短不了见面，也说过话。那杨小梅的模样儿长得俊，什么活儿都能干，心眼里又挺好；大水有一次拿着活计去央表嫂做，表嫂忙不过来，小梅就不言不语的接得去做了。这会儿大水心里想：“小梅真不错！要是娶她作媳妇，我这一辈子可就心满意足啦。”
    表嫂知道大水心里愿意，跟他爹说了几句话，就回去和娘商量。小梅正坐在炕头上作活儿。她今年十七岁了；虽然个子不大，可是长得很结实，平常挑起整桶的水来，走的个快。她娘是个老派人，还叫她留着一条粗辫子，额上梳着“刘海”。这当儿，她一对大眼睛抬起来，看见姐姐对她笑着，低声儿和娘说话，知道是在谈她的亲事呢，就不好意思的红了脸儿，低下头，假装作针线活，眼不看，嘴不说，耳朵可直楞楞的听着哩。她心里盘算：“大水可真不错呀！好小伙子，老实巴结的，挺和善。能找这么个知疼着热的庄稼人，我这一辈子也就称心如意啦。”谁想她娘千不嫌，万不嫌，就嫌大水家里穷，一时拿不定主意，说：“这门亲事，慢慢儿再商量吧。”
    牛大水的表哥，早就不在家里了。本来他是个铁匠，暗里在了共产党，就开个饭铺儿，搞交通，还掩护革命同志来往活动；后来局子里“剿共”，到处抓人，他在家里站不着脚，就出外去了。表嫂成年价织席编篓，养活着一家人。她娘看她挺困难，住了几天，就带着小梅，到姥姥家去。小梅的姥姥家，也不远，在白洋淀里大杨庄。这亲事可就不冷不热的搁下了。
    二
    秋后，土匪闹大了。这一带好些村子都有了土匪，各自安了番号。申家庄有个小土匪，名叫李六子。李六子有一枝枪，五个人。他把村长申耀宗叫去，说：“怎么着？旁的村都安上国号啦，咱村不成立一拨人，人家来吃咱们我可不管哪！”申耀宗瞧他邪得厉害，自己手下的保卫团又都跑光了，心里有些怕情，就依从了。
    当天下午，他们在家庙院子里召集人们讲话。大水爹儿俩也去了。瞧见李六子提个“搂子”④，登上台阶说：“我有个事儿跟大家念叨念叨，眼下哪儿都成立“锅伙”，各村保护各村。咱村也得成立一班人，就吃这个村。这年头，可不分你的我的啦，谁愿意来就来，这就叫“共点！”说着他走下来，掏出一盒大英牌烟卷，嚷着：“咱们共了吧！”就把烟卷儿分了分；当下在家庙院子里安上一口大锅，屋子里盘上一条大炕，“申家班”就算成立了。
    大水他爹看了很生气，把脖子一扭，拉着大水就走，一边走一边说：“这些人尽是瞎折腾，咱们快家去干活！”一到家，可就有个叫小小子的来找大水，商量入伙。牛大水老老实实说：“不行，咱们辈辈没出过这号人，叫人说邪气！”小小子一个人去了。
    这时候，西面铁路线上，日本鬼子往南开，这儿还能透一口气。大水家就去割苇子了。爷儿三个上了小四舱，十二岁的牛小水很灵巧的打起棹⑤，船儿出去半里远；来到白洋淀的苇塘里啦，两张磨亮的镰子就浸到碧清的水里割起来。也不看天上雁儿飞，也不听水鸭水鸡儿叫，大水心里结记着杨小梅，她也在淀里呀，亲事怎样了？谁知道小梅拗不过娘，娘把她许给别人了！已经定了亲。男人名叫张金龙，住在何庄，离大水家不远。大水可不知道啊！日头将没不没的时候，水面一片红光，耀眼睛；他们的船儿载着苇子，又重、又慢、弟兄俩吃力的打着棹，回到堤边来。把苇子全背上岸，天早黑了，月儿已经一树高。
    就在这几天，何庄也成立了“何庄班”，架势可大多啦。领头的何世雄，是个国民党员，在中央军队伍里当过参谋长，家有好地五十顷，枪多人也多。跟小梅定亲的那个张金龙，原是何世雄家“护院的”，也参加了“何庄班”，还当了个小头儿。另外，有些散兵，有些警察，也参加了。李六子和附近的土匪们，怕吃不住劲，都投奔过去了。“何庄班”这就更霸道，更吃开了。天天向各村要东西；要面八百斤，要肉八百斤，要油要醋……要什么都是八百斤。老百姓说：“八百斤，八百斤，剥了皮，抽了筋！”他们可还要钱，按花户，百二八十的摊。大水家刚把苇子给申耀宗打了利，剩下的只得交款。
    大水家交款的第二天，那张金龙骑着大骡子，挎着盒子枪，跑到申家庄来招人；他瞧见牛大水背个粪筐拾粪呢，就勒住了缰绳，歪着头，露出一颗金牙，笑着说：“嘻，傻小子！弄那干吗？跟我去吃白面卷子炖猪肉吧。”大水可认得他，急得光脑瓜儿直冒汗，说：“咱，咱不行，咱没那号本事！”张金龙睁大了眼：“什么？‘没本事！’猪肉白面你不会吃？”大水给他问住了，低下头，随手铲起一块粪，扔到粪筐里，一面走开去。张金龙满脸的瞧不起，拿眼斜他说：“吓，娘老子没把你操好！你眼睛在裤裆里装着呢！”就踢踢骡子，虚打一鞭，跑去了。气得大水瞪了眼，直看他走远。【注】

    牛大水说：“耩也是白耩！要不跑，怎么也是死！”
    老爹说：“跑哪儿去？死了倒好，死不了总得过啊！”
    杨小梅知道在给她说亲，假装作活，耳朵可听着呢。
    张金龙叫牛大水入伙，大水不去。
    张金龙骂他：“娘老子没把你操好！”
