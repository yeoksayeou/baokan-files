The brilliant achievements of the "Northeast Pictorial Publishing House"

　　The largest art institution in the Northeast, the "Northeast Pictorial Publishing House," has compiled and printed eight million copies of various art books and periodicals in the past three years. These have been sold throughout the Northeast and in the liberated areas within the customs. Many excellent works have been produced and reprinted by foreign newspapers and periodicals. The semi-monthly "Northeast Pictorial" has a circulation of 50,000 copies per issue and has reached its 48th issue. Fifty kinds of popular comic strips and photo booklets have been published, totaling 2.5 million copies. More than ten kinds of woodcut and cartoon collections have been published, totaling about 500,000 copies. The New Year pictures, which are most popular among the workers and peasants, have been printed in 2.15 million copies. In addition, about one million propaganda posters and portraits of revolutionary leaders have been published. The publishing house has held no fewer than 50 art exhibitions in various cities and villages. Once, during an exhibition in Changchun, the audience reached 200,000 people within three days. The photographers of the publishing house have taken 20,000 negatives on the front lines, in the countryside, and in the mining areas. They worked tirelessly, and one photographer died in action, while another was wounded. Over the past three years, the publishing house's books and periodicals have played a significant role in boosting the morale of the troops and inspiring enthusiasm for production. Soldiers on the front lines often take "fighting a good battle and striving to be on the pictorial" as one of their goals.

    东北最大的美术工作机关——“东北画报社”，三年来编印的各种美术书刊达八百万本，销行于东北各地及关内各解放区，有不少优秀作品，并为国外报刊所转载。该社半月刊“东北画报”每期发行五万份，已出至四十八期。通俗连环画及照片小册子已出五十种，共二百五十万册。各种木刻及漫画专集出了十多种，共约五十万册。最受工农大众欢迎的年画，印行了二百十五万份。此外，尚出有各种宣传画及革命领袖肖像等约百万张。该社在各城、乡举行美术展览会，不下五十次。一次在长春展览时，三天之内观众达二十万人。该社摄影记者在前线、乡村及矿区所拍摄的底版片，达两万张。他们不辞艰险地工作，曾有一名摄影记者阵亡，另一名负伤。三年来，该社书刊在提高部队士气及鼓舞生产热情上，都起了很大的作用。前方战士常以“打个漂亮仗，争取上画报”作为努力目标之一。
