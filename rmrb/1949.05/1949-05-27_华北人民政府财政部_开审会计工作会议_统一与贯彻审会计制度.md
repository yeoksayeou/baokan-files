  　Unify and Implement Auditing and Accounting Systems
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Ministry of Finance of the North China People's Government convened a North China regional auditing and accounting work conference in Ping (Beiping, i.e., Beijing) starting on the 22nd of this month. Attendees included finance, auditing, and accounting personnel from administrative offices, provincial governments, directly-administered municipal governments, special districts, and county governments, as well as representatives from various directly subordinate financial and tax organs of the North China People's Government, totaling more than 80 people.
    The central focus of this conference is to adapt to the situation and tasks after the complete liberation of North China, strengthen financial management, unify and implement the fiscal auditing system and accounting system of governments at all levels, and, after the meeting, to liquidate the accounts of various regions and prepare the final financial revenue and expenditure accounts for the entire North China region last year.
    At the opening of the conference, Vice Chairmen Lan Gongwu and Yang Xiufeng of the North China People's Government both personally delivered speeches. After explaining the importance of the government's auditing and accounting work in various government tasks, Vice Chairman Lan pointed out that it is necessary to improve the auditing, accounting, and treasury systems, strictly implement revenue and expenditure procedures and the budget and final accounts system, in order to achieve fiscal savings and ensure the integrity of staff; he hoped that this conference would lay the foundation for the new China's auditing and accounting system. Vice Chairman Yang instructed that now that North China has been completely liberated, future construction work first requires us to establish a sound financial system, overcome waste, practice strict economy, take care of the people's burden, and achieve the goals of accumulating capital and developing production. This is the political task of auditing and accounting work from now on. Finally, he emphatically pointed out that it is necessary to establish a unified system from now on, and insist on and implement the system, and oppose the ideas of empiricism and localism. In his opening speech, Vice Minister of Finance Wu Bo called on the delegates to resolutely implement the instructions of Vice Chairmen Lan and Yang. He fully assessed the achievements in the past auditing and accounting work, briefly described the lack of uniformity in the past auditing and accounting work in the entire North China region, pointed out the existing shortcomings, and analyzed the subjective and objective reasons. He pointed out that the basic spirit of this conference is "unifying the system and implementing the system," and called on everyone to start discussions.
    The conference is expected to last ten days. Starting from the 25th, group discussions began on the thematic reports of the heads of various departments of the Ministry of Finance.
