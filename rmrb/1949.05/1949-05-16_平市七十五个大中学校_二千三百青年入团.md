　　Seventy-Five Universities and Colleges in Beiping
　　Two Thousand Three Hundred Youths Enrolled into the Communist Youth League
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 15th), two thousand three hundred and twenty-one New Democratic Youth League members from seventy-five universities and colleges in Beiping, including Peking University, Sino-French University, Huiwen Middle School, and Sicun Middle School, solemnly held an admission ceremony at the auditorium of the Fourth Academy of Peking University. Comrade Xu Liqun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Communist Youth League in Beiping, spoke first. He happily announced that in Beiping, which had been liberated for three months, there were now five thousand Youth League members (excluding those who participated in revolutionary work and entered China University and Revolutionary University). He said: Exemplary student Youth League members should have excellent academic performance and be able to integrate with the majority of students. Without affecting regular class studies, they should strive to participate in social activities related to building a new democratic China and serve the working people wholeheartedly. Liu @, Director of the Beiping Municipal Education Bureau, congratulated the two thousand three hundred Youth League members on behalf of the Beiping Municipal People's Government for joining the League. He encouraged Youth League members to help the educational administrative authorities solve specific school problems, such as private school tuition fees, relief funds, and political studies, thereby developing their own policy thinking. Comrade Song Ping, who represented Chinese youth at the 11th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, reported on the situation of the Soviet Youth League. He hoped that Chinese youth would be good at learning the Soviet youth's spirit of loving labor, loving the motherland, and collectivism and internationalism.
　　Principals and teachers from more than ten middle schools, including Municipal Girls' No. 1 Middle School, attended the meeting. The principal of Girls' No. 1 Middle School praised the excellence of the Youth League members. Many newly admitted male and female League members enthusiastically and excitedly expressed their feelings about joining the League or made self-criticisms. After more than ten middle schools, including Girls' No. 1 Middle School and Youzhen Girls' Middle School, presented flags to the conference, there was a solemn oath ceremony. Two thousand three hundred and twenty-one right hands were raised high, and the oath was read aloud, determined to serve the people loyally. Finally, the Beiping Youth Art Troupe performed songs such as "Youth League Song," "Support Chairman Mao," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and the song and dance drama "Workers' Song."
