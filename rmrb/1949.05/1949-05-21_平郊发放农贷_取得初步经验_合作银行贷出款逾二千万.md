　　Farm Loans Issued in the Suburbs of Beijing
  　Preliminary Experience Gained
  　Cooperative Bank Loans Exceed 20 Million
    [Our Newspaper] According to the spring agricultural loan plan for this year, the business department of the Cooperative Bank began issuing agricultural loans in the suburbs of Beiping (including Changxindian, Fengtai, Tongxian, Nanyuan, Xiyuan, etc.) in late April. This work came to an end in early May. After Deng Zhaoxiang, manager of the Cooperative Bank, and Yu Mian, deputy director of the business department, inspected and understood the situation in various places, and with reference to the work reports of various districts, a preliminary summary of this work was obtained. In this summary, in addition to seeing the achievements of agricultural loans in the suburbs, the most important thing is the new experience gained.
    [Our Newspaper] In the twenty days from late April to early May, the Cooperative Bank issued agricultural and sideline loans of 22,395,000 yuan to 3,861 farmer households in 89 villages in the suburbs of Beiping. All were lent in kind, equivalent to 585,400 jin of millet, 100,590 jin of corn, and 7,110 jin of peanuts. In addition, 12,000 jin of Huachen No. 1 improved corn seeds and 360 jin of improved grain seeds were directly loaned out.
    The loans were mainly used to help farmers purchase fertilizers, seeds and livestock. Those used to purchase fertilizers accounted for 48 percent of the total loans, and the loan households obtained a total of 2,174,177 jin of fertilizers (including manure, compost, sesame residue, etc.). At 500 jin of fertilizer per mu, 43,483 mu of land can be fertilized. Those used to purchase seeds accounted for 18 percent of the total loans (excluding directly issued corn and other seeds), and the loan households purchased a total of 11,676 jin of peanuts (at 20 jin per mu, 583 mu can be planted), 3,256,000 sweet potato seedlings (at 2,000 plants per mu, 1,418 mu can be planted), and 1,240 jin of cotton seeds (at 10 jin per mu, 124 mu can be planted). Direct loans to the Nanyuan Farm were not included in the calculation.
    Loans used to purchase livestock accounted for 10 percent of the total loans, and the loan households purchased a total of 27 head of draft animals, 521 piglets, and 565 chicks. In addition, 2,896,697 yuan was used to purchase agricultural tools; 429,496 yuan and 50 cents were used for water conservancy construction.
    This loan was focused on fertilizers and seeds in terms of use, and on villages that had undergone political transformation in terms of region. The loan households were concentrated on poor and middle peasants who had production difficulties but had the conditions for production. Except for the water conservancy loans, which were small due to insufficient prior estimates, all others met the needs of the masses and the original intentions of the bank.
    Ensuring the use of loans is the most important part of issuing agricultural loans. In this issuance of agricultural loans, due to the good cooperation with the district and village governments and supply and marketing cooperatives, the use of the loans could be guaranteed. In particular, the Changxindian office's method of paying for fertilizers and seeds on behalf of the loan households (actually lending in kind) ensured the use of the loans. Under the conditions of convenient purchases near the city, the method used by the Changxindian office is very good.
    In the future, loans should be closely coordinated with agricultural improvement institutions to vigorously support cash crops
    In this issuance of agricultural loans, some shortcomings were found: (1) Not enough attention was paid to the production conditions in the suburbs of cities, especially cities like Beiping and Tianjin. There was no appropriate cooperation with existing agricultural extension and improvement institutions (such as farms, cotton improvement offices, livestock experimental stations, etc.) to promote the improvement of agricultural and sideline industries through planned loans. Instead, the old ways were adhered to, requiring that the land be planted, which is obviously not enough. (2) With large cities and large industries, agricultural production should be adapted to industrial production, and loans should vigorously support the development of agricultural production that is most needed by industry (i.e., so-called cash crops). Although some of this was done, such as with cotton and peanuts, the awareness was not strong enough, so the effect was not great. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives also need to be vigorously organized. With them, there would be great convenience in lending, lending in kind, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and the savings on loans. For example, the Nanyuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative used loans to organize its members to purchase fertilizer from the Eleventh District Fertilizer Plant, guaranteeing the use of the loans, guaranteeing the fertilization of cotton fields, and at the same time solving the problem of poor sales at the fertilizer plant.

### 平郊发放农贷　取得初步经验　合作银行贷出款逾二千万

　　平郊发放农贷
  　取得初步经验
  　合作银行贷出款逾二千万
    【本报讯】合作银行营业部依据本年度春季农业贷款计划，于四月下旬在北平郊区（包括长辛店、丰台、通县、南苑、西苑等地）开始发放农贷工作，截至本月上旬，是项工作告一段落。经合作银行经理邓兆祥，营业部副主任于勉分别至各地视察了解后，复参考各区工作报告，这一工作得有初步总结。在这个总结中，除了看出郊区农贷的成绩外，最重要的是获得了新的经验。
    【本报讯】由四月下旬至五月上旬的二十天中，合作银行对平郊八十九个村庄、三千八百六十一户农民发放了农业副业贷款二千二百三十九万五千余元。全部以折实贷出，计合小米五十八万五千四百余斤，玉米十万零五千九百余斤，花生七千一百十斤。此外并直接贷出华晨一号改良玉米种子一万二千斤，改良谷种三百六十斤。
    贷款主要用于帮助农民购买肥料、种子和牲畜。用于购买肥料者占总贷款物百分之四十八、贷款户共得肥料（包括大粪、堆肥、麻酱滓等）二百一十七万四千一百七十七斤。以每亩施肥五百斤计，可肥田四万三千四百八十三亩。用于购买种籽者占总放款百分之十八（直接放出玉米等种子未计内），贷款户共购花生一万一千六百七十六斤（以每亩下种二十斤，可种五百八十三亩），白薯秧三百二十五万六千株（以每亩插二千株计，可种一千四百十八亩），棉籽一千二百四十斤（以每亩十斤计，可种一百二十四亩），直接贷给南苑农场者没计算在内。
    贷款用于购买牲畜者占总放款百分之十，贷款户共购耕畜二十七头，小猪五百二十一口，小鸡五百六十五只。此外尚有二百八十九万六千六百九十七元用于购买农具；四十二万九千四百九十六元五角用于水利修建。
    这次贷款在用途上是集中于肥料和种籽，地区上都集中于政权经过改造的村庄，贷户集中于生产困难而又有生产条件的贫、中农。除水利贷款因事先估计不足致为数较少外，其他都符合群众要求，与该行本来意图。
    保证贷款用途是发放农贷最重要的一环。在这次发放农贷中，由于与区村政府及供销合作社配合较好，因之在用途上都能得到保证。特别是长辛店办事处，代替贷户付肥料、种籽款项的办法（实为贷实）更使用途确保无疑。在城市附近购买方便的条件下，长辛店办事处所用的办法是很好的。
    今后贷款应与农业改进机构密切配合大力扶植经济作物
    在这次发放农贷工作中，发现仍有一些缺点：（一）对城市特别是平津这样的城市郊区的生产条件没有很好的注意，未与已有的农业推广改进机构（如农场、棉产改进处、畜牧实验所等），适当的配合，有计划的贷款，促进农副业的改进，而仍墨守成规，要求把地种上就算，这显然是非常不够的。（二）有了大城市、大工业，农业生产即应与工业生产相适应，贷款也应大力扶持发展工业所最需要的农业生产（即所谓经济作物）。这次虽做了一些，如棉花、花生等，但意识性不够，所以作用不大。此外，供销合作社也亟需大力组织。有了它，贷款、贷实、城乡物资交流及贷款的节省上都有很大方便。如南苑供销合作社即以贷款贷给合作社组织社员到十一区肥厂购买肥料，保证了贷款用途，保证了棉田加肥，同时解决了粪厂销路不好的困难。（宇）
