Self-Criticism and Response

　　CCP Xiuwu County Committee's Self-Criticism on the "Poor People in Charge" Mistake

　　Editor's Note: On March 7th (before the leveling of the land) this newspaper's second page published an article from the Taihang Branch criticizing the "Poor People in Charge" approach in the Xiuwu Chengguan District. The article pointed out: "In Xiuwu's mobilization of the masses last winter to eliminate remnant bandits and organize production, the erroneous practice and saying of 'Poor People in Charge' emerged. According to a survey by the Dongguan Poor People's Association in the county, this included poor people, vendors, handicraft workers, independent laborers, and even workers were absorbed and led by the poor people..." When publishing this article, this newspaper also included an editor's note asking "What strata do the poor people include? How can they lead everything?" Now the Xiuwu County Committee has made a self-criticism, which is published below for the study of comrades working in the cities.

Comrade Editor:

　　Since the Party newspaper pointed out the error of the "poor people's line" in our county's Chengguan District, we have conducted a serious examination, recognized the error, and made a self-criticism at the county-wide cadre expansion meeting. Some cadres in Chengguan initially couldn't accept it, but after in-depth study, they recognized the error, greatly advancing the work. Our self-criticism is roughly as follows:

　　The root cause of this error is, first and foremost, the leadership's vague understanding of urban work policies and insufficient grasp of the Party's general policy and general line, leading to this fundamental error. We failed to understand and implement the correct principle of relying on the workers and uniting all working people to build the city. We mechanically transferred the rural approach to the city, mistakenly regarding the poor people as the rural poor peasants to rely on, and approved the absurd slogan of "the poor people ruling the world." We did very poor work with the workers, instead leading them with the poor people. At the same time, there were errors in the standard for classifying the poor people's composition. Some comrades believed that the poor people included peddlers, freelancers, and handicraft workers, mistakenly relying on them as a class.

　　In the leadership composition of the Poor People's Association, there were no workers participating. The selection of targets only looked at temporary enthusiasm, thinking that being poor was good. There was insufficient vigilance against urban hooligans and bad elements, allowing them to infiltrate the organization and commit wrongdoings, resulting in seriously impure Poor People's Association organizations in some areas. For example, in individual streets, there was a phenomenon that one could not participate in the coal-pushing team without being in the Poor People's Association, which was an erroneous development of the "poor people's line."

　　Secondly, our understanding of the city's situation and characteristics was very poor. After liberation, we only one-sidedly proposed to restore and develop urban industry and commerce, resolve the various concerns of merchants, provide loans for support, but because the purpose of the loans was unclear, speculators took advantage, causing drastic fluctuations in market prices. Mobilization of the working class was very poor. There were more merchant associations than worker associations. The Federation of Industry and Commerce was actually a chamber of commerce and an upper-level organization. Therefore, in the previous period, some factory owners illegally treated workers harshly, prohibited workers from holding meetings, and paid excessively low wages. After this examination, the situation has been initially clarified. It has been decided to abolish the Poor People's Association organization. In areas with many peasants in the four outer districts, peasant associations will be established. Purely urban peasants will also participate in the four outer districts' peasant associations. Labor unions will be established in the city, and the transformation will be completed within one month. Pilot supply and marketing cooperatives will be established to combat speculators and stabilize the market.

　　Regarding the organizational form of the Poor People's Association, it is implementing the instructions of the prefectural committee, and the prefectural committee is now deciding to establish labor unions, peasant associations, and chambers of commerce separately.

### 中共修武县委会关于“贫民当家”错误的检讨

专栏：检讨与答复

　　中共修武县委会关于“贫民当家”错误的检讨
    编者按：本报三月七日（未移平前）二版，曾发表了太行分社批评修武城关区工作中“贫民当家”一稿，该稿指出：“修武在去冬发动群众肃清残匪组织生产中，曾错误地出现“贫民当家”的作法和说法，据该县东关贫民会的调查，其中包括有贫民、商贩、手工业者，独立劳动者，而工人亦被吸收，受贫民领导……等”。本报在发表此稿时也提示了“贫民包括什么阶层？何以能领导一切？”的按语。今修武县委会已做了检讨，特发表于次，供城市工作同志的研究。编辑同志：
    自党报指出我县城关区的“贫民路线”错误以后。我们认真作了检查，认识了错误，并在全县扩干会上作了检讨。城关有些干部开始时接受不下，经过了深刻研究，才认清错误所在，使工作大进一步。我们的检讨约如下：
    造成这种错误的根源，首先是领导思想上对城市工作政策模糊，对党的总政策总路线掌握不够，以致犯了这样原则性的错误。我们未把依靠工人，团结全体劳动人民建设城市的正确原则体会执行，机械的搬运农村一套到城市，错误的把贫民认为是农村的贫农当作依靠，批准了“贫民坐天下”的荒谬口号，对工人工作做的很差，相反的以贫民来领导，同时对贫民成份划分标准上也有错误，有些同志把贫民认为包括小贩、自由职业者、手工业者，错误地作为一个阶层来依靠。
    在贫民会的领导成份上，没有工人参加，选择对象只看一时积极，穷就好，对城市流氓坏人警惕不够，使其钻进组织为非作恶，形成有些贫民会组织严重不纯。如个别街有不在贫民会不准参加推煤小组等现象，这是“贫民路线”的错误发展。
    其次是对本城情况与特点了解很差，解放后只片面的提出恢复和发展城市工商业，解决商人各种顾虑，支行贷款扶植，但由于贷款目的不明，使奸商投机，造成市价暴涨暴跌，而对工人阶级发动很差，商人会多于工人会，工商联合会实际是商会，且是上层组织，所以前一时期有某些厂主苛待工人，不准工人开会，工资过低等非法行为。经过这次检查初步澄清了情况，决定贫民会组织取消，在四关农民多的地方成立农会，城内纯粹农民亦参加四关农会，城内建立工会，在一月内改造完毕。试办供销合作社，打击奸商，稳定市场。
    关于贫民会组织形式问题，是执行地委指示，现地委正决定分别成立工会、农会、商会。
