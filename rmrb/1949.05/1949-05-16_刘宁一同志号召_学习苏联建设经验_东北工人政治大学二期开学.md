　　Comrade Liu Ningyi Calls for Learning from Soviet Construction Experience
　　Second Term Opens at Northeast Workers' Political University
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 15th] The Northeast Workers' Political University held its second term opening ceremony on the 12th of this month. More than 800 outstanding worker students from various industrial systems and provincial and municipal trade unions gathered together. Li Fuchun, member of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Ningyi, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, who had just returned from Prague after attending the World Congress of Advocates for Peace, both attended to offer their congratulations. Comrade Li Fuchun said in his congratulatory speech: It is a major event that outstanding members of the Northeast workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are entering this university to study. In the old society, workers were oppressed and had no place in middle schools or universities, but today so many workers have entered the workers' university, which is the result of the heroic struggle of the working class and the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for decades. The task of the Workers' Political University is to train worker cadres. The main content of education is class education and policy study. Comrade Liu Ningyi reported in his speech the concern and respect of Soviet and European workers for the great liberation struggle of Chinese workers and the people of both countries. He called on the students to learn from the construction experience of Soviet workers and strengthen internationalist thinking. The first term of more than 700 students of the Northeast Workers' Political University graduated on the 28th of last month after studying for two months, and set off on the 29th to enter the customs and go south to work.
