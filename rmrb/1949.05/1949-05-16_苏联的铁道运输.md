　　Soviet Railway Transportation

    Simultaneous with the nationalization of land, banks, and industry, the October Socialist Revolution also implemented the nationalization of railways, thereby transforming railways from instruments of capitalist exploitation into powerful weapons for socialist construction of the national economy. During the Soviet regime, railways increased by 30,000 kilometers, an increase of almost 50 percent. Many railways of vital importance to the national economy were built, such as the Turkestan–Siberia Railway, the Moscow–Donets Railway, the Ural–Kazakhstan Railway, the Caspian Sea–Ural Railway, etc. The railway trunk lines were all double-tracked and adopted automatic brakes. About 2,000 kilometers of railway have been electrified; hundreds of large stations have been successfully built. During this period, many locomotive and carriage manufacturing plants were also constructed, all equipped with the latest technology. During the Second Five-Year Plan (1933-1937), these factories produced 5,960 locomotives and 255,000 carriages. In 1926-1927, the average daily carriage of passengers and goods was only 28,000; by the beginning of 1941, it had increased to 100,000, an increase of almost threefold. In 1913, the total railway freight volume was 65.7 billion ton-kilometers; by 1940, it had increased to 415 billion ton-kilometers.

    World War II severely tested the Soviet railway system. In the summer and autumn of 1941, thousands of military trains headed to the front lines, while simultaneously, thousands of trains transported factory equipment in the opposite direction. In a short period, more than 1,300 industrial enterprises were transferred from the western and southern parts of the Soviet Union to the east; nearly 1.5 million carriages were used to transport people and goods.

    When the Soviet army began its victorious westward advance from Stalingrad in the winter of 1942-43, the retreating Germans destroyed railway tracks and bridges, and blew up and burned parking lots, stations, and water towers. Railway workers closely followed the Soviet vanguard, and while the fighting was still intense, they repaired more than 50,000 kilometers of railways and 185 bridges in the areas liberated from the Germans.

    The speed of railway restoration was astonishingly high. The first Soviet ammunition train entered Vienna on April 10, 1945, while street fighting was still going on in the city center. The Soviet army entered Berlin on April 23, 1945, and at 4 p.m. on April 25, the first Soviet train entered the Berlin station.

    During the war, the construction of new railways did not stop. In northern Soviet Union, the North Pechora Line, spanning vast forest areas and stretching 1,200 kilometers, was laid. A railway of 1,000 kilometers was built along the right bank of the Volga River, which played an important role in the defeat of the German army at Stalingrad. A railway of 400 kilometers was laid along the northwest coast of the Caspian Sea. A new White Sea railway connected the ice-free port of Murmansk with the Moscow-Yaroslavl-Arkhangelsk line.

    The German fascist aggressors greatly damaged the Soviet railways. They destroyed 65,000 kilometers of railway tracks, blew up 13,000 bridges, 317 locomotive parking lots, 1,600 water towers, 129 locomotive and carriage repair shops, dozens of railway engineering offices, and 4,100 stations. They also destroyed, damaged, or looted 15,800 steam and diesel locomotives and 428,000 carriages.

    Restoring and further developing the Soviet railway system is one of the main tasks of the new Five-Year Plan. Under the previous three Five-Year Plans, a total of 41.2 billion rubles had been used for railway construction. Now, under the first post-war Five-Year Plan, railway construction expenditure will be 40.1 billion rubles, accounting for almost one-sixth of the total investment in the Soviet national economy stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. This money will not only be used to restore technical equipment and railway carrying capacity to the 1940 level, but also to exceed that level.

    On the Soviet railways, there are now 14,000 freight trains and 6,500 passenger trains running every day. A total of 3 million men and women serve on the railways, of whom 129 have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor – the highest award in the Soviet Union. Many railway workers have been elected as deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    The achievements of the restoration and development of Soviet railways are the result of the selfless labor of the Soviet people. These achievements are a clear demonstration of the superiority of the socialist planned economy. (Shen Jiang)

### 苏联的铁道运输

　　苏联的铁道运输
    与土地、银行和工业实行国有化同时，十月社会主义革命也实行了铁道国有化，从而使铁道从资本主义剥削的工具变成了进行全国国民经济社会主义建设的强大武器。在苏维埃政权期间，铁道增加了三万公里，即增加了几乎百分之五十；许多对于国民经济至关紧要的铁道都建造起来了，例如土西铁道，莫斯科——顿涅茨铁道，乌拉尔——哈萨克铁道，里海——乌拉尔铁道……等。铁道干线均为双轨，并采用了自动制动机。约二千公里的铁道已经电气化了；数以百计的大车站建筑成功了。这一时期，并建设了极多机车与车皮制造厂，其设备都是最新式的。在实行第二个五年计划期间（一九三三至一九三七年），这些工厂出产了机车五千九百六十台及车皮二十五万五千辆。在一九二六至一九二七年，每日载运乘客和货物的车皮平均仅有二万八千辆；一九四一年初，已增加为十万辆，即增加了几乎三倍。一九一三年，铁道的总载运量为六百五十七亿公里吨；至一九四○年，即增加为四千一百五十亿公里吨。
    第二次世界大战使苏联的铁道系统受到了严重的考验。一九四一年夏秋之际，数以千计的军车开向前线，而同时又有数以千计的列车载运工厂设备开向相反的方向。短时期内，便有一千三百余家工业企业从苏联的西部和南部转移至东部；载运人货，共使用车皮近一百五十万辆。
    当苏军于一九四二——四三年冬从斯大林格勒开始胜利的西进时，退却的德国人破坏了铁轨和桥梁，炸毁和焚烧了停车场、车站和水塔。铁道工人曾紧紧跟随苏军先头部队，于战事尚酣时便在由德国手中解放出来的地区修复了铁道五万余公里和桥梁一百八十五公里。
    铁道修复工作的速度是高得惊人的。第一列苏军弹药火车于一九四五年四月十日驶进维也纳时，城中心区仍在进行巷战。苏军于一九四五年四月二十三日攻入柏林，而在四月二十五日下午四时，第一列苏军火车便开入了柏林的车站。
    战时，建造新铁道的工作也没有停顿过。苏联北部敷设了横跨广大森林区的北皮巧拉线，长达一千二百公里。伏尔加河右岸沿岸建造了长达一千公里的铁道，它在使德军在斯大林格勒败北的战事中扮演了重要的角色。里海西北岸沿岸敷设了长达四百公里的铁道。一条新的白海铁道，则将摩曼斯克不冻港与莫斯科—亚尔干日尔干线联结起来了。
    德国法西斯侵略者曾大大损毁了苏联的铁道。他们破坏了铁轨六万五千公里，炸毁了桥梁一万三千座，机车停车场三百一十七处，水塔一千六百座，机车与车皮修理场一百二十九处，铁道工程处几十处，车站四千一百处。他们并破坏了、损毁了或抢走了蒸汽机车与柴油机车一万五千八百台、车皮四十二万八千辆。
    修复与进一步发展苏联的铁道系统，乃是新五年计划的主要任务之一。在以前的三个五年计划下，总共有四百一十二亿卢布已用于铁道建设方面；而在现在，在第一个战后五年计划下，铁道建设费将为四百零一亿卢布，占五年计划所规定的苏联国民经济投资总额几乎六分之一。这一笔钱不仅将用来使技术设备及使铁道载运能力恢复到一九四○年的水平，而且要超过该水平。
    在苏联的铁道上，现在每天有一万四千列货车和六千五百列客车行驶。服务于铁道上的男女职工共三百万人，其中一百二十九人荣获了社会主义劳动英雄的称号——苏联最高的奖励。许多铁道工人已当选为苏联最高苏维埃的代表。
    苏联铁道修复与发展的成绩，乃是苏联人民忘我的劳动的成果。这种成绩乃是社会主义计划经济的优越性的明证。  　（沈江）
