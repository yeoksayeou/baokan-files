　　The Workers' Movement in Northeast Railways
　　Reflections from the Pingjin Delegation's Return from the Workers' Congress
　　[Special interview by this newspaper] The delegation of employees from railway administrations in Ping, Tianjin, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and other regions, who participated in the first Workers' Congress and Model Workers' Conference of Northeast Railways, returned to Ping on the 10th. A reporter specially interviewed the head of the delegation, who spoke about the general situation of the workers' movement in Northeast Railways. He said: Trade unions have been widely established throughout Northeast China. Under the slogan of "Everyone runs the trade union," trade union organizations have been implemented in every small unit. For example, the Acheng Engineering Section not only has a trade union at the section level, but also has worker groups under the section. Employees in each supervisory area are divided into groups of thirteen or fourteen people. Every six groups have a central group. Each group has personnel responsible for meritorious service, record keeping, study, technology, recreation, communication, labor protection, mutual aid, sanitation, vegetable gardens, and sports. In each group, almost everyone has a position. When there is work, they execute their duties separately. The entire railway's employee benefits have implemented labor insurance, which provides certain guarantees and subsidies for the birth, death, illness, disability, and other accidental disasters of railway employees and their families. The total amount of welfare funds is 830 million yuan. Group shares account for approximately 7.96% of the total, production profits account for 51.83% of the total, and other sources account for approximately 35.60% of the total. In terms of production: actively encourage pig farming, chicken raising, and vegetable growing. After the implementation of the train crew responsibility system, Du Xianyang, the driver of train number 96 in Harbin, emerged. His locomotive safely traveled more than 106,000 kilometers, exceeding the Class A inspection period of 50,000 kilometers stipulated by the Ministry of Railways by more than double, and won the glorious title of "Iron Ox" locomotive. In the past three years, there have been 13,063 individual meritorious services by 11,758 people, and 3,149 collective meritorious services by 27,171 people. In the process of implementing the responsibility system, there have also been significant achievements in saving and inventions. For example, Zhang Zhongye, a driver at the Qiqihar and Melaer locomotive depots, traveled 20,000 kilometers in temperatures of minus 30 to 35 degrees Celsius, never delayed, and saved 410 tons of coal and 307 kilograms of oil. There are many, many such examples. In addition, they have contributed and collected a total of 3,948 kinds of materials, totaling 48,957,685 pieces, saving 1,359,410 kilograms of coal, worth 19,456,761,175 Northeast yuan; and there were more than 400 inventions and transformations, totaling more than 120,000 pieces. He finally added: During the 24 days of participating in the Northeast Workers' Congress and Model Workers' Conference, we personally witnessed many moving scenes: First, the sincerity of the employee representatives and workers in Northeast China towards us made us feel the love of the working class; second, their meticulousness in handling affairs, such as the orderly "May Day" rally of more than 200,000 people; third, everyone, regardless of gender, age, or status, worked together with one heart, united and helped each other in learning; fourth, we saw hundreds of model worker heroes, and their spirit of hard work and diligent family building deeply moved us.
