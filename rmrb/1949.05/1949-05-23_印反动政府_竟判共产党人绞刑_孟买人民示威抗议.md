Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, May 22nd: India continues to carry out anti-communist and anti-democratic suppression. The Special Tribunal of Hyderabad State sentenced eight communists to hanging on the 20th. Four communists were sentenced to life imprisonment. Arrests of communists and trade unionists have also been carried out in Zhanbu Bo, Bombay, Delhi and elsewhere. Three hundred and fifty communists and members of other democratic groups have been held indefinitely in Bombay prisons without trial. They have announced a hunger strike, demanding a public trial and protesting the extremely difficult prison conditions and the cruel treatment by the prison authorities. All India Trade Union Congress Chairman Dange, who has been in prison for more than a year without trial, has also joined the hunger strike despite suffering from serious illness.

The authorities' persecution of democrats has aroused righteous indignation among progressive people in India. In the first half of May, there were multiple protest demonstrations in Bombay. Police detained demonstrators and searched the relatives, friends, and families of imprisoned communists. On the 5th, a women's demonstration in Bombay demanding the release of communists and other democrats was met with police attack. On the 8th, a demonstration of more than 4,000 people was fired upon by police. On the 11th, a sympathy strike by Bombay workers for those on hunger strike in prison was undermined by police and yellow unions.

    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社德里讯：印度继续在进行反共反民主的镇压。海德拉巴土邦特别法庭于二十日将八名共产党人判决绞刑。四个共产党人被判无期徒刑。赞部波、孟买、德里和其他地方又进行逮捕共产党人和工会人员。三百五十名共产党人和其他民主团体的成员，未经审讯即被无限期地关在孟买狱中。他们宣布绝食，要求公开审讯，并抗议非常困苦的监狱条件和监狱当局残酷的待遇。全印职工大会主席丹吉在狱中未受审讯已达一年多，他虽然身患重病也参加了绝食。
    当局的迫害民主分子在印度进步人士中引起了正当的义愤。五月上半月，孟买发生了多次抗议示威。警察拘禁示威者。搜查被囚共产党人亲戚朋友与家庭。五日，孟买要求释放共产党人和其他民主人士的妇女示威，遇到警察进攻。八日，四千多人的示威行列遭警察开枪射击。十一日，孟买工人为狱中绝食者举行的同情罢工被警察与黄色工会破坏。
