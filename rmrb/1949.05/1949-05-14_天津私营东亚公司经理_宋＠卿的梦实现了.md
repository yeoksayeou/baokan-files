    Tianjin Private Dongya Company Manager
    Song @Qing's Dream Comes True
    After listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech, he understood that capitalists also have a future under the leadership of the Communist Party, and he decided to take on the burden of active production.
    [Tianjin News] Dongya Company, a private company in Tianjin with three factories (weaving, sack, and chemical) and more than 1,000 employees, has changed its past hesitant attitude and is actively preparing to add machinery, establish new factory sites, and expand production due to the manager, Song @Qing, recognizing the Communist Party's policy of "developing production." After the liberation of Tianjin, like other capitalists, Song @Qing, due to the malicious propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, was very skeptical of the CCP's policies of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. Song @Qing frankly admitted, "At that time, I mainly paid attention to the government's decrees in the newspapers, to see if I was going to be 'struggled' against!" As a result, he didn't care much about production, 70% of the weaving machines were stopped, and he was determined to "eat it all up and then shut down the factory." However, it has been more than three months since the liberation of Tianjin, and the People's Government has not confiscated a single private factory, and the workers have not "struggled" against a single capitalist. On the contrary, based on its established policy, the government has reasonably mediated many labor-capital disputes and helped some private factories solve problems related to raw materials, sales channels, and even starting operations. In short, after the Communist Party came, apart from seeing that everything was done according to policy with unwavering loyalty, there was no sign of the facts he suspected. With the facts before him, Song @Qing, after severely questioning himself, began to eliminate his concerns.
    On April 21st, Comrade Liu Shaoqi visited his factory and spoke to the representatives of the workers and staff. When Comrade Shaoqi spoke about the policy of considering both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, as well as the laws and future of social development, the long-depressed Manager Song smiled! He took a long breath from the bottom of his heart: "This time, I understand!" After the meeting, he suggested to the workers' representatives that April 21st be designated as a festival for the Dongya Enterprise Company, and that a commemoration be held every year on this day. He said, "My ideal of developing the enterprise is like a dream, which I have been 'dreaming' for so many years. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, it has truly come true—this is the turning point for me from passive waiting to active development."
    With the assistance of the workers, Song @Qing wrote a letter to Comrade Liu Shaoqi on April 30th, outlining a plan and explaining his determination to lead the workers of Dongya Company in expanding production. Now, with the purchase of a large quantity of raw materials, the hemp factory has decided to add a night shift; the wool factory has decided to purchase more raw materials to increase production; and the chemical factory has also decided to start operations within days, using domestic raw materials to replace imported ones, and will produce medicines suitable for the masses according to their needs, and plans to open a second hemp sack factory.
    In order to help solve the company's difficulty in adding new factory sites, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government has connected the 700 mu of land originally scattered at the West Railway Station into one piece when resolving the issue of land in the suburbs. Manager Song @Qing is about to go to Hong Kong to raise funds and purchase machinery for the second sack factory to expand production. He is determined to make achievements within six months. He said, "In the past, I carried a burden for a long time, which was a 'passive' burden. Now, I have put down this 'passive' burden and taken up the 'active' burden. Although I feel heavy, I am confident that I can carry it well."

    天津私营东亚公司经理
    宋＠卿的梦实现了
    他听了刘少奇同志讲话，明白了在共产党领导下资本家同样也有前途，便决心挑起积极生产的担子。
    【天津讯】津市拥有织毛、麻袋、化学三个工厂及职工一千余人之私营东亚公司，由于经理宋＠卿，认识了共产党“发展生产”的政策，已改变了过去徘徊犹豫的态度，正积极准备添置机器，增设厂址，扩大生产。津市解放以后，宋＠卿与别的资本家一样，由于受了国民党反动派的恶意宣传，对于中共的发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策，颇多怀疑，宋＠卿直率地承认说：“那时候，我每天看报纸，多是注意政府的法令，看看我是不是够上‘斗争’啦！”于是生产也不大管了，织毛机停了十分之七，他抱定了“吃光了就散厂”的态度。可是天津解放迄今已三个月有余，人民政府没有没收过一家私营工厂，工人们没有“斗争”过一个资本家；相反地，政府本着既定政策，已合理地调解了多起劳资纠纷，并帮助若干私营工厂解决了原料、销路，甚至开工的问题，总之，共产党来了以后，除了看到事事按着政策、忠诚不移的办事以外，丝毫看不出他所怀疑的事实出现。事实摆在面前，宋＠卿在严厉考问自己以后，于是他开始消除自己的顾虑了。
    四月二十一日，刘少奇同志去参观他的工厂，并对职工代表讲了话。当少奇同志讲了公私兼顾劳资两利政策以及社会发展规律及前途时，这位长久忧闷的宋经理笑了！他长长的，从内心里吐出了一口气：“这一回我可明白了！”会后，他向职工代表会建议：把四月二十一日，定为东亚企业公司的一个节日，每年逢此，举行纪念。他说：“我发展企业的理想象一个梦，一直‘梦’了这多年，今天，在共产党领导下，才真正实现了——这是我由消极等待到积极发展的转折点。”
    宋＠卿在职工协助之下，四月三十日给刘少奇同志写了一封信，列出计划，说明他决心领导东亚公司职工扩大进行生产的决心。现在由于购入了大量原料，麻厂决定加开夜班；毛厂决再添购原料，增加生产；化学厂也决于日内开工，原料由国产原料来代替，并将根据群众需要，制出适合于广大群众应用的药品，筹划再开麻设袋第二厂。
    津市人民政府为帮助解决该公司增设厂址困难，在解决市郊土地问题时，把该厂原在西车站分散的七百亩土地给连结在一块了。刻宋＠卿经理即将赴香港筹备资金和购置麻袋第二厂的机器，以扩大生产，他决心要在六个月内做出成绩来。他说：“过去，我长期挑着一副担子，那是‘消极’的担子，现在，我放下了这副‘消极’担子，挑起了‘积极’的担子，虽感沉重，然我有信心把它挑好。”
