Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th -- Kuomintang remnant bandits are intensifying their destruction and looting of Shanghai. According to news from Shanghai on the 14th, the remnant bandits have been bombing civilian houses in the outskirts of Shanghai for more than thirty hours. Many rural areas in the western suburbs have been bombed into flat ground. The old, weak, women and children, driven out of the villages, are crowded around Hongqiao, carrying some belongings rescued from the hands of the thugs. In the fields, nearly ripe rice and other crops are left unharvested. The Kuomintang bandit troops occupy the high-rise buildings on Hongqiao Road, carrying out blatant destruction and looting, tearing down doors, windows, railings, and uprooting flowers and trees everywhere. The bandit gangs forcibly occupy the school buildings in the urban area; and have notified that all hotels in the city will be requisitioned to station troops. The bandit soldiers stationed in schools and hotels are wasting water and electricity as much as possible, without paying any price. The pseudo-mayor Chen Liang declared that cotton yarn, bristles, tung oil, frozen eggs, etc., worth 12 million US dollars will be requisitioned and transported to Annam, India and other places. It is said that they will be exchanged for food, but no one in Shanghai believes that they will see a single grain of food returned.

　　上海残匪炸民房大抢劫
  　害得多少老弱无家可归
    【新华社北平十五日电】国民党残余匪帮加紧对上海的破坏和抢掠。据上海十四日消息：残匪在上海外围爆炸民房，已经进行了三十个钟头以上。西郊许多农村，被炸成平地。被赶出村庄的老弱妇孺，背着从暴匪手中抢救出来的一些财物，拥挤在虹桥一带。田地里留着无人收割的快要成熟的稻米和其他庄稼。国民党匪军占住虹桥路上的高楼大厦，进行公然的破坏和抢劫，到处拆毁门窗栏杆，拔除花木。匪帮强行占用市区各学校的校舍；且已通知说将征发市内一切旅馆用来驻兵。驻在学校、旅馆里的匪兵，尽量浪费水电，不付任何代价。伪市长陈良宣称将征发价值一千二百万美元的棉纱、猪鬃、桐油、冻蛋等，运往安南印度等地。据说是要换回粮食，但没有一个上海人相信他们会看到一颗粮食换回来。
