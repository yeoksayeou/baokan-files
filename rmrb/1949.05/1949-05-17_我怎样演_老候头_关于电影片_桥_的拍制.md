　　How I Played "Old Hou Tou"
　　-- About the Filming of the Movie "The Bridge"
　　Chen Qiang
　　Participating in the filming of this major art film "The Bridge" made me very excited; at the same time, I felt that I was not familiar enough with the lives of workers. In the past, I had acted in very few worker roles, and the performances during the Anti-Japanese War mostly reflected the struggle stories of the rural areas behind enemy lines. In 1940, when I performed in "Jidong Uprising," I portrayed the worker as a petty-bourgeois intellectual in worker's clothing. You couldn't smell any worker's breath on him, and you couldn't see any class feelings or anger of resistance. At that time, my acting life was still very immature, and I couldn't find the reason for the failure, I just thought that worker roles were difficult to play. This idea was not right; in the rehearsal of "The Bridge," I had a new understanding of acting in worker roles.

　　Director Wang Bin asked me to play Old Hou Tou - an old hero in his fifties. I was really a bit timid myself. The director promised us that he would try his best to help solve the difficulties in creation. First, he sent comrades with heavier roles to the Harbin Railway Factory to experience life; at the same time, he negotiated with the Ministry of Railways to shoot the exterior scenes of "The Bridge" at the Railway Factory.

　　After arriving in Harbin, in order to familiarize ourselves with the general working conditions of the workers, we first used the method of visiting the factory every day. Later, we took it a step further and went to find the objects of our roles separately. In order to familiarize ourselves with their family lives, we often visited them at their homes. When we found workers who were similar to our roles, we went further to make friends with them. For example, Comrade Wang Jia’yi went to make friends with the personification of Liang Ri’sheng - the old electric furnace worker Lang Yi’zeng; Comrade Lü Ban often went to work with Director Li of the Railway Factory, or participated in their factory affairs meetings; Wu Yizhu (played by Yu Yang) went to find Hu Weizhu; Xi Bu Xiang (played by Du Defu) went to find Shi Bao Xiang; I also found my own object, he was Hou Zhanxi himself, around fifty years old, and had been a riveter for more than thirty years. Although his right hand had some nerve paralysis, he seemed to be in high spirits and happy. He was very talkative, and once he started talking, he would talk endlessly. He was an old worker who had experienced many hardships, and had participated in the great strike of the Railway Factory in 1927. He was also elected as one of the representatives to negotiate with the factory. After that incident, he had a deep impression in his heart that the "Red Party" was working for the welfare of the workers. Since the liberation of Northeast China, he has been eager to take the lead in his work, because he soon discovered that the Communist Party is the "Red Party." The lever of the air drill was invented by him after liberation. I learned the temperament of the old workers and the vicissitudes of life from Old Hou Tou. He also taught me how to use an air drill with a lever.

　　In order to seek the rhythm of labor and the characteristics of the workers, I often wandered around in various scenes, sometimes staying in one place for half a day; sometimes I would pick up the tools they had just put down and try them out. At first, they felt very strange, but later when they knew that we were here to make a movie, they understood what we were doing, and they were willing to help us learn.

　　The first step of work was to study the script, and we spent a lot of time on this part, because we knew that if the script was not thoroughly studied, there would be many problems in the future. For example: the actors cannot grasp the author's thoughts and intentions; the actors cannot create complete roles; the thoughts of the actors and the director cannot be unified; the actors can only be the director's appendages - "models" in front of the camera.

　　In the process of studying the script, the actors with heavier roles and the director studied the script together, and divided up the shots. This film really exerted the power of the collective, and everyone provided many valuable opinions. For example, when studying the script, everyone felt that there was no climax in the film, so we arranged a fire scene. In order to make it reasonable without problems, we mobilized everyone to find the basis for the fire. With everyone's efforts, we came up with using black iron bricks as the fuse for the fire. This newly added unit not only created a climax for the whole film, but also gave Old Liang a heavy blow. This further showed the indomitable perseverance of the working class; and deepened the contradiction between Wu Yizhu and Xi Bu Xiang. There were many similar places where everyone's creativity was brought into play, and this may be the characteristic of our work this time!

　　After the experience of life and the study of the script came to an end, before the shooting started, my first important job was to establish the image of Old Hou Tou; I accepted the first experience of playing "Leave him to fight Lao Jiang!" As a result, I didn't organize the role very well at first. If you don't have a vivid image of your role in your mind, you will feel at a loss when you stand in front of the camera, because film acting is different from stage acting. Stage acting requires the entire rehearsal process of the play. In the process of continuous rehearsal, the actors go through selection and refinement to organize their roles into a perfect, unified, and specific character image. The production of a film is segmented and jumping, with one shot after another. Therefore, it can be said that the stage play can establish the image later, and establish the image in the process of continuous rehearsal, while the film actor must establish the specific character and image of the role in advance, the more detailed the better. If this work is done well, then it is already half the battle, because he is no longer affected by segmentation, he will have a shadow of a typical character as a clue for your production.

　　Comrade Hou Zhanxi helped my creative work a lot, but my creative role was not limited to him alone, I absorbed the general characteristics of workers from many aspects.

　　One night, around twelve o'clock, because of the pain of creation, I ran to the nearby steam hammer field to find the image. It was really powerful! This kind of scene is absolutely impossible to see during the day. The five-ton steam hammer smashed on the red-hot steel block, and sparks splashed everywhere. The workers bathed in the red-hot sparks, and took turns rotating the steel block. Look, how clear their rhythm is, how beautiful and powerful their posture is! This kind of labor movement completely attracted me. Soon it was time for them to rest and eat. They gathered around a few cast steel blocks and sat down, eating, talking, laughing, and making noise. Oh, they are really the people in the world who can tell jokes the most. They are really full of vitality! They are really lovely. I sensitively opened my senses; accepting their infection to me. Their humor when they tell jokes, their extremely humorous movements, and the kind of vigorous vitality gradually cultivated the initial fetal form of the role in my heart. I constantly asked them about their lives in the enemy-puppet era. When they talked about the enemy-puppet era, their emotions immediately changed. They talked endlessly about the pain they suffered in the enemy-puppet era. One of the workers in his forties said to me: "I don't know if you believe what I say, but in the past, when our workers entered the factory, it was like falling into the hands of a stepmother! Those little noses and those dogs would beat you a few times if they wanted to, and scold you a few times if they wanted to. We are so big, but we have to hold it in. You don't even dare to breathe. Now our workers have finally seen their relatives! I said this, do you believe it..." How could I not believe it? This is exactly what my role is going to say. I must strive to say these words from the mouth of Old Hou Tou, because this is the driving force for Old Hou Tou to urge everyone to step up their work.

　　The character of Old Hou Tou has been determined. He has the tenacity of Shandong people and the cheerful character of industrial workers. Seeing the contrast between the two societies makes him love the new society even more. According to his character, I designed him with a connected beard, which would make the lines of Old Hou Tou more powerful. What I am most satisfied with is my old "Manchuria Railway" hat. Although some people say that it looks like a Japanese military hat, it does outline the image of an old railway worker after all; if it weren't for it, I really can't imagine what it would look like, maybe like a farmer, maybe like an old cook, unthinkable.

　　I designed Old Hou Tou's language to be Shandong dialect, because after the character and image were determined, I felt very uninspired when I read the lines in Mandarin. Sometimes I chatted with a few Shandong workers (about two-fifths of the railway factory are Shandong people). Under the infection of their speech, occasionally my words would also have a bit of Shandong accent. I felt very kind myself. In this way, I boldly used Shandong dialect. At first, the director was a bit suspicious of the effect of my speaking like this, but later he affirmed and agreed to my doing so. Although what I said was not very similar, it felt much kinder, which added a strong color to the role.

　　The film "The Bridge" is the first film to reflect the lives of workers and praise the working people. Because there is no experience, there are many shortcomings. Please comrades and compatriots give more opinions after watching it, so that our film industry can gradually improve. Written on May 2nd in Dongying

### 我怎样演“老候头”——关于电影片“桥”的拍制

　　我怎样演“老候头”
    ——关于电影片“桥”的拍制
    陈强
    这次我参加这部较大的艺术片“桥”的拍制，使我非常兴奋；同时又觉得自己对工人生活太不熟悉。过去我演的工人戏太少，抗日时期所演出的多是反映敌后农村的斗争故事。一九四○年演出“冀东爆动”，我把工人演成一个穿了工人衣裳的小资产阶级知识分子，在他身上嗅不到一点工人的气息，更看不出阶级感情与反抗的怒火。当时我的演剧生活还很幼稚，找不出失败的原因，只是觉得工人戏难演。这种想法并不对；在“桥”的排戏中，我对于演工人戏有了新的认识。
    导演王滨同志要我演老候头——一个五十多岁的老英雄，我自己确实有点胆怯，导演答应我们，尽量想办法帮助解决创作中的困难，首先派我们这些比重戏重的同志，到哈尔滨铁路工厂去体验生活；同时并向铁道部交涉，就在铁路工厂三拍“桥”的外景。
    到哈之后，为了熟悉工友们一般做工的情形，我们就先用参观的方式每天去参观工厂，后来我们就又进了一步，分头去找自己脚色的对象。为了熟悉他们的家庭生活，我们也常到他们家中去拜访。当我们找到了与我们脚色相近的工友后，我们便更进一步的去同他们交朋友，例如王家乙同志去同梁日升的化身——老电炉工人郎义曾同志交朋友；吕班同志也常和铁路工厂李厂长一道去上班，或是参加一下他们的厂务会议；吴一竹（于洋饰）去找胡维珠；席卜祥（杜得夫饰）去找石宝祥；我也找到了自己的对象，他就是侯占喜本人，年纪五十上下，做了三十多年的铆工匠，虽说右手有点神经麻痹症，看来他的精神却很饱满、愉快，他很健谈，一说起话来就滔滔不绝，他是个饱经风霜的老工人了，曾参加过一九二七年铁路工厂的大罢工，他还被推选为向厂方交涉的代表之一。从那个事件之后，在他心里留下了深刻的印象，“红党”是给工人谋福利的。自从东北解放之后，他就急急带起头来工作，因为他很快发现了共产党就是“红党”。压风钻的杠杆就是他在解放之后发明的。我在老候头的身上学到了老工人的气质与饱经风霜的风度，他并且教会了我使用带杠杆的风钻。
    为了寻求劳动的节奏，与工人的特点，我往往在各个现场里串来串去，有时在一个地方一呆就是半天；有时把他们刚放下来的工具拿起来试一试。最初他们感觉得很奇怪，后来当他们知道我们是来照电影的，他们也就了解我们是在做什么了，他们都愿意帮助我们学习。
    开始第一步工作是先研究剧本，我们在这部份花的时间很多，因为我们知道，如果剧本没有深刻研究的话，将来问题一定很多。例如：演员不能掌握剧作者的思想与企图；演员不能创造完整的角色；演员与导演的思想无法统一；演员只有做导演的附庸——镜头前面的“模特儿”。
    在研究剧本的过程中，我们几个比较戏重的演员，便和导演一面研究剧本，一面就把镜头分了。这部戏确实发挥了集体的力量，大家提供了不少宝贵的意见，比如研究剧本时，大家都感觉这部戏看不到高潮，我们便布置了一个起火的场面；为了使他能合理的不出毛病，便发动大家找失火的根据，在大家努力之下，便想出用黑铁砖来做起火的导火线。这个新添的单位，不但给全剧造成了高潮，而且也给了老梁一个沉重的打击。这样就更表现了工人阶级百折不挠的毅力；又更加深了吴一竹与席卜祥的矛盾。类似这样发挥大家创造力的地方很多，这也许就是我们这次工作的特点吧！
    体验生活，与研究剧本，告一段落之后，开拍戏之前，我的第一步重要工作，就是建立老候头的形象；我接受了第一次演“留下他打老蒋吧！的经验，结果在先没有把角色组织的很好，脑子里没有你那角色的活生生地形象的话，当你站在镜头前面时，便会感觉到茫然不知所措，因为电影的演技不同于舞台戏，舞台戏要经过全剧的排练过程，演员在不断的排演当中，便经过选择、洗练，把自己的角色组织成一个完美、统一、特定的人物形象。电影的摄制是分割的、跳跃的，一个镜头一个镜头的拍演，所以说舞台戏可以后建立形象，在不断的拍演过程中建立形象，而电影演员却要事先把角色特定的性格、形象、建立起来，越细致越好。如果这部工作做的很好的话，那末已经是成功了一半了，因为他不再受到分割的影响，他会有一个典型人物的影子，作为你拍制的线索。
    侯占喜同志对我的创作工作帮助很大，但是我的创作角色，并没有局限在他一人身上，我从多方面吸收了工人一般的特点。
    有一天晚上大约十二点钟左右，因为创作的痛苦，我便跑到就近的汽锤场去寻找形象，真有力量呵！这种场面白天是绝对看不到的，五吨重的大汽锤捣在通红的钢块上，火花四外飞溅着，工友们浴着通红的火花，在那里轮番交替的转动着钢块，看，他们的节奏多么明快呀，姿态是多么美，多么有力量呵！这种劳动动作完全吸引了我，不一会儿便到了他们休息与吃饭的时候了，他们聚拢在几块已铸好的钢块附近坐下来，吃着、说着、笑着、闹着、呵呀，他们真是世界上最会说笑的人们呵，他们真是充满了生命力的人们呵！他们真是可爱，我把感关锐敏的放开来；接受他们对我的感染，他们说笑时的风趣，他们那极幽默的动作，和那种生龙活虎般的生命力逐渐的在我心中培育出初步角色的胎儿来，我不时的讯问他们在敌伪时代的生活情形，说起敌伪时代，他们的情绪就马上不同了，滔滔不绝的叙诉着他们在敌伪时代所受的痛苦，其中有一位四十多岁的工友对我说：“我说这话不知道你信不信，过去咱们工人一进工厂，就算是掉在后娘手里啦！人家小鼻子和那些狗们，说打就打你两下，说骂就骂你两句，咱这么大的人啦就得噙着，你连大气都不敢吭，这会咱工人可算是见了亲人啦！我说这话你信不……”这怎么不信呢？这正是我那脚色所要说的话，我一定争取把这些话从老候头口中说出，因为这就是老候头推动大家加紧工作的动力。
    老候头的性格确定了，他带有山东人的顽强，产业工人的爽朗性格，看到两个社会的对比，使他对新社会更加爱护，根据性格，我把他设计成一个连鬓胡子，这样会使老候头子的线条更加有力量，我最满意的是我那顶旧“满铁”帽子，虽然有人说象是日本军帽，但是它究竟点画出一个老铁路工人的形象；如果不是它，那就真想象不出是什么样子了，也许象个农民，也许象个老伙夫，不堪设想。
    我把老候头的语言，设计成山东话，因为性格与形象确定之后，我再用普通话去读台词，感觉到很不带劲，有时我同几个山东工友聊天（铁路工厂大约有五分之二是山东人）。在他们说话的感染下，偶而我的话里也带点山东腔，我自己感觉得很亲切，这样一来我就大胆的使用山东话了。最初导演有点怀疑我这样说话的效果，后来他便肯定的答应我这样做了，虽然我说的不太象，但是感觉上要亲切的多了，这样给角色也增加了浓厚的色彩。
    反映工人生活，歌颂劳动人民的电影，“桥”的制作这还是第一部，因为没有经验，所以产生６的缺点很多，请同志们，同胞们看了多提意见，使我们的电影事业渐渐改进。  五月二号写于东影
