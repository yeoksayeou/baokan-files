Wall Street's Secret War Against Hungary
Soviet Union A. Moskvine

In August and September of this year (referring to 1948, same below), the Hungarian security organs conducted an investigation and discovered that "MAORT" (Hungarian-American Oil Company) had been engaging in criminal activities aimed at undermining the economy of the young Hungarian Republic.

These sabotage activities were directed by the "Standard Oil Company of New Jersey" and are part of a secret war waged by American monopoly groups and their lackeys in Europe against people's democratic countries. The methods used in this war are systematic slowdowns, bribery, sabotage, and espionage, forcing the people of Eastern European countries to use the utmost vigilance to thwart the conspiracies of those across the Atlantic who covet world hegemony.

Budapest published a white paper detailing the inside story of the "MAORT" sabotage activities. The white paper contains communiqués from the Hungarian Ministry of the Interior and written documents from the company's former administration, accompanied by photographs of their confessions, which explain the whole development of the events.

Here is the story of "MAORT". In June 1933, the Hungarian Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the 1911 law, signed a contract with "European Gas & Electric Company," stipulating that the company had priority rights for surveying and exploiting oilfields in the area west of the Danube River, with a term of forty years. A few years later, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, American "personnel" began to pay great attention to the activities of "European Gas & Electric Company" in Hungary, as Hungary's oil production was constantly increasing. Thus, in 1938, "MAORT" was established, taking over the rights of "European Gas & Electric Company" in Hungary. At the same time, all the shares of "European Gas & Electric Company" were transferred to the control of "Standard Oil Company," the world's largest oil monopoly. "MAORT," established as the legal successor of "European Gas & Electric Company," was transformed into a branch of "Standard Oil Company" in Hungary.

When World War II broke out, under the arrangement of American and German "personnel," "MAORT" served Nazi Germany, supplying oil to Hitler's army. In 1941, when relations between the United States and Hungary became strained, "MAORT" General Manager Paul Rutterman (of German nationality), who was also the representative of "Standard Oil Company" in Hungary, had to leave Hungary temporarily. But before leaving, he made all necessary arrangements for the company to continue its work. He delegated full authority to Simon Papp, a Hungarian fascist, instructing him to obey the command of Klassen, the manager of the "German-American Petroleum Company" in Hamburg (the German branch of "Standard Oil Company").

Podog Abel, the former chief of the purchasing department of "MAORT," said during interrogation:

	I admit that in the situation of 1941, it was indeed very strange that the manager of the Hungarian "MAORT" had to listen to the command of the head of a German company, whose interests were contrary to the interests of the Americans... There is no doubt that the oil produced by "MAORT" at that time enhanced the combat power of Nazi Germany. I can only explain this phenomenon with one fact: international capitalists value profit most.

Simon Papp, following orders, supplied oil to "German-American Petroleum Company," and the quantity increased year by year, because production was constantly increasing. In 1938, the total output of "MAORT" was only 37,000 tons, while in 1944 it increased to 810,000 tons, an increase of more than twenty times. In this way, the Nazi oil masters and the Horthy government were of course very satisfied. Hitler awarded Papp a medal for his contribution to Nazi Germany.

When the Soviet army approached Budapest, Papp feigned illness. At the same time, with his consent, the equipment of "MAORT" was being moved to Western Europe. After the liberation of Hungary, Papp returned to his position. By November 1945, Paul Rutterman also returned to Hungary. Soon after, Rutterman's representative, the American George Benardin, and the company's former manager and other elements also returned.

The following facts were revealed: Before leaving New York, Rutterman and Benardin were summoned to see Esterbrook, McConnel and Bolton of the production department of "Standard Oil Company," who told Rutterman and Benardin to instigate various forms of industrial slowdown in Hungary to hinder the restoration and development of the Hungarian economy.

	"Our goal," Paul Rutterman said in the interrogation court, "was to keep the oil underground, waiting for a change in the Hungarian regime, and ensure that it would be exploited when it was profitable for 'Standard Oil Company'."

Benardin admitted that he had received similar orders when he left the United States, instructing him to keep Hungary's oil production at the lowest possible level -- this was very important for "political reasons."

As facts proved, Rutterman and Benardin resolutely carried out their masters' orders. As a result of the slowdown, "MAORT"'s production fell to 674,500 tons in 1946, further to 569,400 tons in 1947, and in the first half of 1948, the total output of all oil wells was only 242,900 tons, which is equal to half of the same period in 1943.

The continuous decline in "MAORT"'s oil production attracted the attention of the Hungarian State Security Organs. In August of this year, an investigation was conducted into the company's activities, and it was discovered that its managers were implementing slowdowns by all possible means. For example, drilling work that began in 1946 was deliberately carried out in areas where geological surveys had already shown that there were no oil reserves.

	"I admit," said Simon Papp, "that I intentionally designated third-rate areas for drilling work, because these areas had no hope of producing oil at all. This is how I satisfied the Americans' demands."

The "MAORT" administration used various methods to hinder the company from obtaining the necessary equipment. In June 1947, due to the insistence of the Hungarian Supreme Economic Council, the company authorities had to order a new type of oil pumping machine from the United States, but at the same time, they knew that this machine should not be given to Hungary. Paul Rutterman confessed: "If we used these oil pumping tubes, we could produce 200 tons more per day... When I went to New York in December 1947, Mr. Byers, the production manager of 'Standard Oil Company,' told me that he did not want to deliver the machines ordered by Hungary, because Hungary was politically opposed to the United States."

These matters were carefully concealed from Hungarian industrial leaders. At the same time, "MAORT" spent a lot of money buying unnecessary equipment, so that other Hungarian companies that needed this equipment could not obtain it.

The "MAORT" administration, following the orders of their American masters, undermined the company's financial operations. They did their best to prevent the increase of financial resources in various production departments, and even refused loans provided to them by the Hungarian government. They squandered the company's funds on matters unrelated to oil production. They themselves used large amounts of company funds. As Benardin admitted, the financial arrangement of "MAORT" was like this: to leave as little money as possible for basic production investment, for example, spending 191,000 "Forints" (Hungarian currency) to open a park in Nagynizsa, spending 206,000 "Forints" to pave asphalt roads and build fences around houses, etc.

In order to advance their plans, Rutterman and Benardin gathered fascists and semi-fascists around themselves. The total loss given to Hungary by the former managers of "MAORT" amounted to hundreds of millions of "Forints". The White Paper pointed out that the purpose of the sabotage was to weaken Hungarian democracy and damage the world's democratic front. But as a result, the conspiracy was discovered, and those saboteurs were isolated. Rutterman and Benardin were expelled from the country, and their Hungarian accomplices have been arrested and will soon be brought to the People's Court for trial.

At the end of September, the Hungarian government decided to place "MAORT" under state management, which will ensure the restoration and development of the Hungarian oil industry. Hungarian newspapers reported that after the sabotage activities of the "MAORT" manager were uncovered, the company's confidential documents were handed over to the American minister, and American Vice Consul Radom helped a major saboteur escape abroad.

These facts, the *SahadwEP* newspaper said on September 28, "indicate that this incident is not a separate anti-Hungarian activity of the 'Standard Oil Company' giants, but a sabotage activity that has received full support from American foreign policy."

The newspaper correctly emphasized that lessons must be learned from this incident, and vigilance must be increasingly raised against the conspiracies of American monopoly capitalists, because they are dreaming of new wars and dreaming of seizing the wealth of other countries.

　　华尔街对匈牙利的秘密战争
    苏联  Ａ·摩斯克文
    本年（指一九四八年，下同）八、九两月间，匈牙利保卫机关进行了侦查工作，发见“匈美油公司”（Ｍａｏｒｔ）一直在进行犯罪活动，目的在于暗害年轻的匈牙利共和国的经济。
    这些破坏活动受了“新泽西美孚油公司”的指使，成为美国独占集团及其在欧洲进行反人民民主国家的走狗们所指挥的秘密战争的一部分。在这一战争中所运用的方法是系统的怠工、贿赂、破坏和间谍活动，使得东欧各国人民不得不用最大警惕来粉碎大西洋彼岸的觊觎世界霸权者的阴谋。
    布达佩斯发表了一本白皮书，说明“匈美油公司”破坏活动的底细。白皮书包含匈牙利内政部的公报和该公司前任行政当局的书面证件，附有他们供词的摄影，这白皮书说明了事件发展的全貌。
    下面是“匈美油公司”的故事。一九三三年六月，匈牙利财政部根据一九一一年的法案，与“欧州煤气电气公司”签订了一纸合同，规定该公司在多瑙河以西区域内察勘和开采油矿的优先权，期限是四十年。几年之后，即在第二次大战爆发前不久，美国“工作人员”对于“欧洲煤气电气公司”在匈牙利的活动，开始大大注意起来，因为匈牙利的油产不断的增加着。于是在一九三八年成立了“匈美油公司”，把“欧洲煤气电气公司”在匈牙利的权利接收过来。同时“欧洲煤气电气公司”的所有股份，都转到全世界最大的独占油公司——“美孚油公司”的掌握中了。作为“欧洲煤气电气公司”的合法继承者而建立的“匈美油公司”一变而为“美孚油公司”在匈牙利的分公司。
    第二次大战爆发的时候，“匈美油公司”在美德双方“工作人员”的布置之下，为纳粹德国服务，把油供给希特勒的军队。一九四一年，美匈关系紧张，“匈美油公司”总经理，即“美孚油公司”驻匈代办保尔·鲁特曼（德国籍）不得不暂时离开匈牙利。但在离开之前，他作了种种必要的安排，使公司继续工作。他把全权委托给匈牙利的一个法西斯分子西蒙·柏普，教他服从汉堡“德美石油公司”（“美孚油公司”在德国的分公司）经理克拉森的指挥。
    “匈美油公司”前采买部主任波多格·亚倍尔在侦讯期中提到这一点时说道：
    我承认在一九四一年的情况下，那事情确乎很奇怪，匈牙利“匈美油公司”的经理居然要听德国公司首脑的指挥，后者的利益是和美国人的利益相反的……。毫无疑问，“匈美油公司”那时所生产的油增强了纳粹德国的作战力。我只能用一个事实来解释这种现象，就是国际大资本家最看重的是利润。
    西蒙·柏普遵照命令把油供给“德美石油公司”，其数量年有增加，因为产量不断增加。一九三八年“匈美油公司”的全部产量只有三万七千吨，而一九四四年便提高到八十一万吨，增加了二十多倍，这样一来，纳粹油主人和霍尔第政府当然都十分满意。希特勒为了柏普对于纳粹德国的贡献而颁给柏氏以勋章。
    当苏联军队逼近布达佩斯的时候，柏普假装生病。同时得他的同意，“匈美油公司”的设备正在被搬到西欧去。匈牙利解放之后，柏普回到自己的职位上。到了一九四五年十一月，保尔·鲁特曼也回到匈牙利来了。不久之后鲁特曼的代办，美国人乔治·倍纳汀，以及该公司前经理同其他分子也都回来了。
    如下的事实泄露出来了：鲁特曼和倍纳汀在离开纽约之前，曾被召去看“美孚油公司”生产部的爱斯特勃鲁克、麦康伦和波尔顿等人，他们叫鲁、倍二人在匈牙利策动各种形式的工业怠工，以阻挠匈国经济的复兴和发展。
    “我们的目标”，保尔·鲁特曼在侦查庭上说：“是要把油保存在地下，等待匈牙利政权发生变化，保证到了对‘美孚油公司’有利可图的时候进行开采”。
    倍纳汀承认自己离开美国时曾接到类似的命令，要他把匈牙利的石油产量尽可能保持在低水平上——为了“政治的理由”，这是很重要的事情。
    如事实所证明，鲁特曼和倍纳汀坚决执行了主子们的命令。由于怠工的结果，“匈美油公司”的产量在一九四六年下降到六十七万四千五百吨，一九四七年再降到五十六万九千四百吨，而一九四八年的上半年，则全部油井的出产总量不过二十四万二千九百吨，即等于一九四三年同一时期的一半。
    “匈美油公司”石油产量的不断降低，引起了匈牙利国家保卫机关的注意，本年八月间，对于该公司的活动进行侦查工作，结果发觉它的经理们运用一切可能的方法实行怠工。例如一九四六年开始的打钻工作，故意在这样的一些地区进行，而这些地区之没有油藏，已经由地理上的察勘知道的了。
    “我承认”，西蒙·柏普说：“我有意指定三等地区来进行打钻工作，因为这些地区简直没的钻出油来的希望。我就是这样来满足美国人的要求。”
    “匈美油公司”行政当局用种种方法阻挠公司获得必要的配备。一九四七年六月，由于匈牙利最高经济会议的坚持，公司当局不得不向美国定购一套新式唧油机器，但他们同时又知道这种机器是不该给匈牙利的。保尔·鲁特曼供认道：“要是用这些唧油筒，我们每天可以多生产二百吨……。我在一九四七年十二月到纽约时，‘美孚油公司’生产部长布业斯先生告诉我说：他不想交付匈牙利所定购的机器，因为匈牙利在政治上反对美国。”
    这些事情都很当心地隐瞒了匈牙利的工业领袖们。同时“匈美油公司”用大量金钱买进不需要的器材，这样来使需要此项器材的匈牙利其他公司无法获得它。
    “匈美油公司”行政当局遵照美国主子们的命令，破坏该公司的财政业务。他们竭尽心力来阴止各生产部门财力的增加，甚至拒绝匈牙利政府供给他们的贷款。他们把公司的资金耗费在与油产无关的事情上。他们自己利用了大量的公司基金。如倍纳汀所承认的“匈美油公司”的财政安排是这样的：要尽可能少留可供基本生产投资的钱，例如用十九万一千“Ｆｒｏｒｉｎｔ”（匈币）在纳吉尼沙开辟一个公园，用二十万六千“Ｆｒｏｒｉｎｔ”在那里铺柏油路和在房子四周围筑篱栅等等。
    鲁特曼和倍纳汀为推进自己的计划，把法西斯和半法西斯分子集合在自己周围。“匈美油公司”前任经理们给予匈牙利的全部损失达数万万“Ｆｒｏｒｉｎｔ”。白皮书指出：破坏的目的是要削弱匈牙利的民主，损害世界民主阵线。但结果阴谋被发觉了，那些破坏分子被孤立了。鲁特曼和倍纳汀被逐出境，他们的匈牙利同谋者们已遭逮捕，马上要送到人民法庭前受审了。
    匈牙利政府在九月尾决定把“匈美油公司”放在国家管理之下，这样可以保证匈牙利石油业的恢复和发展。匈牙利报纸报导：“匈美油公司”经理的破坏活动被破获以后，曾把公司的秘密文件移交给美国公使，而美国副领事雷侗帮助一个主要破坏分子逃往国外。
    这些事实，九月二十八日“ＳａｈａｄｗＥＰ”报说，“指明这个事件不是‘美孚油公司’巨头们单独的反匈活动，而是获得美国外交政策充分支持的破坏活动。”
    该报正确地强调必须从这一事件吸取教训，对于美国独占资本家的阴谋，必须日益提高警觉，因为他们正在梦想新战争、梦想攫取他国的财富。（光美译自“新时代杂志”）。（完）
