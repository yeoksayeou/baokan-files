[Jizhong Electric] The Hebei Daily published an editorial entitled "Extensively Carry Out Drought-Resistant Sowing and Seedling Protection and Replanting Movement," pointing out that since the beginning of the sowing season this year, the entire region has experienced a severe spring drought. Cadres at all levels have widely organized the masses to dig wells, repair old wells, and carry water for planting. Therefore, great achievements have been made in the sowing work. First, in terms of digging wells and repairing water conservancy facilities, according to statistics from 33 counties including Gaoyang and Qingyuan, a total of 44,841 earth wells had been dug by the end of April. According to the situation in various places, each earth well can supply water for planting 10 to 15 mu. According to statistics from 16 counties in the 9th and 11th Special Districts, a total of 2,926 new waterwheels were purchased and 4,926 old waterwheels were repaired. Other places such as Jin County, Anxin, and Ba County have also achieved certain results in repairing canals and diverting water for irrigation. Secondly, in terms of increasing cotton planting, according to statistics from 36 counties in the entire region, more than 1,034,000 mu have been planted by the end of April, initially completing 60% of the cotton planting plan; while 15 counties in the 8th Special District have completed more than 388,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by 9%. Regarding the increase in planting of peanut and oil crops, a vigorous campaign is currently underway. Finally, all localities have achieved considerable results in planting early-maturing crops and seizing the time to cultivate and plant in drained land. However, most areas in the region have not yet received rainfall, and in many areas, the seedlings are not fully emerged, and some have died due to drought after emergence. This has presented us with a new, more arduous, and heavier task of ensuring seedling survival and replanting in production. For this reason, the following urgent tasks should be grasped immediately:

First, the movement to open canals, dig wells, repair waterwheels, windlasses, and water scoops, especially the digging of earth pits and earth wells, should be widely carried out. Farmers in various places have made many creations in digging earth wells, and these creations should be widely publicized and promoted. Mobilize and organize the masses to fully utilize water conservancy. Sow in shady places, carry water and pull water for planting, and resolutely strive to plant the land. Second, in terms of sowing and planting, the Little Fullness solar term is approaching. In addition to continuing to plant cotton, all localities should make every effort to plant peanuts and early-maturing crops such as melon seeds, pumpkin, and cowpea to supplement the autumn grain. Mobilize the masses to create more effective drought-resistant planting and seedling protection methods. Third, attention must be paid to ensuring seedling survival and replanting. Planting does not mean that the task is completed; it must be ensured that the seedlings survive. After the cotton or other crops have germinated, if the seedlings have not emerged completely, efforts should be made to replant them in time. If the time for replanting cotton has passed, sesame or other crops can be replanted in the cotton fields to ensure that no land is left idle. After the cotton seedlings have emerged completely, the masses should be mobilized and organized to water and hoe as early as possible to prevent the seedlings from wilting due to drought. Fourth, in the leadership of this year's spring production and sowing work, due to the masses' deeply ingrained self-sufficiency thinking, coupled with the severe spring drought, the difficulty of leading production has increased. Some cadres lack methods and are eager to achieve results, and therefore, the phenomenon of coercion and command has recurred relatively widely; in the 10th Special District, the phenomenon of forcibly organizing large-scale labor is relatively common, which is divorced from the masses. In addition, some cadres lack confidence and enthusiasm in leading the masses in production, and are lax, undisciplined, and severely anarchic. Both of these deviations must be resolutely overcome. The editorial finally called on the entire party and people of Jizhong to mobilize urgently, extensively carry out drought-resistant sowing and seedling protection and replanting movements; at the same time, practice strict economy in food, clothing, and use, eliminate waste, and prepare to overcome all the difficulties caused by the drought.

[Taihang Electric] In order to vigorously organize the masses to eliminate insects, fight drought, and carry out spring plowing and sowing, the Taihang Administrative Office issued an instruction on the 7th of this month, stating that we must always pay attention to the development of disasters, take effective measures in a timely manner to fight against disasters, and allow no slightest麻痹, negligence, or侥幸psychology. In areas where it has not yet rained, we should make great efforts to solve various difficulties and immediately organize the masses to carry water for planting; in areas where it has rained, we should help the masses solve various difficulties in sowing and sow on time; in areas with serious insect pests, we should organize forces to capture and eliminate them according to the disaster situation, and eliminate them wherever they are found, and must not allow them to spread; for disaster areas with serious spring famine, we should fully organize the masses to produce to overcome the famine and ensure that the cultivated land is sown on time; new areas should not miss the farming season. For this reason, it is necessary to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power, organize labor, and mobilize women to produce. We must earnestly implement the joint order of the North China Government and the North China Military Region "on restricting the use of civilian labor during the spring plowing period," and we should strictly inspect it. We must pay attention to the implementation of the production plan to ensure that agricultural production reaches an increase of 10% and ensure the supply of industrial raw materials.

### 保苗补苗寸土不闲　河北日报提出生产新任务

　　保苗补苗寸土不闲
  　河北日报提出生产新任务
    【冀中电】河北日报以“广泛开展抗旱播种，保苗补苗运动”为题发表社论，指出：今年播种季节开始，全区发生严重春旱，各地干部广泛的组织群众普遍进行了挖土井修旧井、挑水点种。因此，在播种工作中获得很大的成绩。首先在挖土井和修水利方面，据高阳、清苑等三十三县统计：截至四月底共挖土井四万四千八百四十一眼。根据各地情况，地般土井每眼能供挑水点种十亩到十五亩。又据九、十一专区十六个县统计：共购新水车二千九百廿六辆，修旧水车四千九百廿六辆。其他晋蒿、安新、霸县等地，修渠引水浇地，都有一定收获。其次在增种棉花方面，全区据三十六个县的统计：截至四月底止，已种一百零三万四千余亩，初步完成种棉计划百分之六十；而八专区十五个县，则已完成三十八万八千余亩，超过了原计划百分之九。关于增种花生油料作物，目前正在大力突击。最后，各地在种植早熟作物和水脱地抢耕抢种中，都获得相当成绩。但全区绝大部分地区至今尚未落雨，很多地区禾苗出的不全，有的出苗后又被旱死。这就给我们在生产中提出了保苗补苗更艰巨繁重的新的任务，为此应立即抓紧以下几件紧急工作：
    第一、应把开渠凿井，修制水车、辘轳、水斗，特别是挖土坑土井运动广泛开展起来。在挖土井方面各地农民已有很多创造，应把这些创造，广泛宣传推广。发动与组织群众，充分利用水利。阴地播种，挑水拉水点种，坚决地争取把地种上。第二、在播种点种方面。小满快到，各地除抓紧继续种植棉花外，应全力突击点种花生及瓜子、北瓜、豆角等早熟作物，以接济秋粮。发动群众创造更多行之有效的抗旱点种和保苗的方法。第三、关于保苗补苗，必须引起重视。种上并不等于完成了任务，必须做到保活。棉花或其他作物发芽后，苗没出齐的，要争取时令实行补苗，如补种棉花时令已过。可在棉地里补种芝麻或其他作物，保证作到寸地不闲。棉苗出齐后应发动组织群众尽早浇水早锄，不能使苗因旱枯萎。第四、在今年春季生产和播种工作的领导上，由于群众在思想上还存在着浓厚的自给自足思想；加以严重春旱，增加了领导生产的困难。有些干部缺少办法、急于求成，因而较普遍的重复发生了强迫命令的现象；十专区则比较普遍的发生了强制组织大拨工的现象，脱离群众。另外有的部分干部对领导群众生产缺乏信心和热忱，松懈散漫、严重的无纪律无政府现象。这两种偏向，都必须坚决克服。社论最后号召冀中全党全民紧急动员起来，广泛开展抗旱播种和保苗补苗运动；同时厉行节约节食节用，肃清浪费现象，准备克服天旱所造成的一切困难。
    【太行电】为大力组织群众灭虫、抗旱春耕下种，太行行政公署特于本月七日发出指示称：时刻注意灾害的发展，及时采取有效办法与灾害作斗争，不容有丝毫麻痹，忽视与侥幸心理。在尚未落雨地区应大力解决各种困难，立即组织群众担水点种；已落雨地区应帮助群众解决下种中的各种困难，按时下种；在虫害严重地区应根据灾害情况组织力量进行捕灭，发现在哪里，消灭在哪里，万勿使之蔓延；对春荒严重的灾区，应从全力组织群众生产渡荒中，保证耕地的按时下种；新区做到不务农时。为此，就必须解决劳畜力不足的困难，组织劳力发动妇女生产。切实执行华北政府与华北军区“关于春耕期间限制动用民力”的联合命令，并应严格检查。必须注意生产计划的贯彻，使农业生产达到增产一成，并保证工业原料的供给。
