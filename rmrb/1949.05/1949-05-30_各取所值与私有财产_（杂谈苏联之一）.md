　　To Each According to His Work vs. Private Property
　　(Random Notes on the Soviet Union, Part 1)
　　Mao Dun
　　As everyone knows, communist society is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The Soviet Union is currently still in the socialist stage, and its current approach is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." This means that the compensation for work varies according to the difficulty and quality of the work. This is because the Soviet Union's current industrial and agricultural production has not yet developed to the point where it can meet all the needs of the people on average (please note the words "all needs"). For example, it cannot unconditionally provide dentures to everyone who needs them, nor can it provide luxury goods as much as possible (communism does not oppose enjoyment and does not oppose luxury goods; on the contrary, it advocates that everyone should enjoy luxury goods; what it opposes is that a few people can enjoy them as much as possible, while most people do not even have food to eat). Under these circumstances, if we want to achieve "to each according to his needs," we can only intensify production and improve production. The Soviet Union has used various reasonable scientific methods to improve production, and the method of "to each according to his work" certainly also helps to intensify production and improve production.
　　Therefore, there are differences in the income of Soviet people. However, these varying incomes are all the price of labor (physical or mental), and there is no element of exploiting others. A's income is high because he works hard and well, and B's income is low because his work is poor and he is lazy. The assessment of wages must be done in a democratic manner (production meetings of various industrial organs), and it is not something that managers and factory directors can arbitrarily decide based on their personal preferences.
　　Although the income of Soviet people varies, the difference is definitely not as large as the difference between individuals in capitalist countries. In a capitalist country, the income of a factory manager, even in terms of his monthly salary, is ten times or more than the monthly salary of a worker in his factory. And this is only his (the manager's) monthly salary! When the factory makes money, the manager's share of the dividends is dozens of times more than what a worker receives. Moreover, the factory manager must be a shareholder, and he also has income such as dividends. Calculated in this way, the difference in individual income in capitalist countries is more than a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand times. In the Soviet Union, because only the price of labor is people's income, the difference will not be very large. In Soviet production organs, the difference between the general highest and lowest salaries does not exceed ten times. There is no dividend system. If the factory makes more profit, the funds used for employee welfare will also increase. For people who do good work, there is a reward system, that is, in addition to the regular salary, they are given extra remuneration according to their work performance (usually calculated by the number of excess finished products exceeding the prescribed production volume). Some "Stakhanovite" workers may have their extra remuneration as large as their regular salary, so their income will exceed the lowest salary earners in the same factory by more than ten times, but this is also the price of their labor and not unearned income.
　　The price of labor is respected in the Soviet Union. Property accumulated by labor is also respected. Therefore, the personal private property of Soviet people is protected by law. However, if anyone wants to use his private property to engage in exploitation, it is not permitted by law. The law certainly does not prohibit anyone from using his private property to improve his own living enjoyment. People with high incomes can enjoy as much as possible. But in Soviet society, people with a lot of money are not respected, and those with a lot of money who only care about personal enjoyment are not only not respected but also despised. Therefore, people with high incomes (such as great writers whose books can sell millions of copies each year and whose royalty income is very considerable), in addition to being able to enjoy a slightly higher standard of living than others, often donate the extra money to public welfare funds (such as the Writers Association's literary fund, which is specifically for helping poor, sick, or young writers), or purchase government bonds. Antique shops are commonly seen on the streets of major Soviet cities, and these antique shops do particularly good business, which is also one way for high-income Soviet people to spend their money. Soviet law does not prohibit individuals from collecting books, paintings, utensils, etc. that have historical and artistic value. There are still many private collectors in the Soviet Union. Most of these collectors are famous actors, artists, and writers.
　　Personal private property (including movable and immovable property) can be inherited by one's children, grandchildren, or anyone designated by oneself. The term inheritance tax does not exist in the Soviet Union. Those who receive the inheritance do not have to pay taxes, but if the deceased has debts, then those who receive the inheritance have an obligation to repay the debts. Soviet inheritance law stipulates that the person's children (including adopted children), grandchildren, and immediate relatives and friends who have lost their ability to work have the right to receive the inheritance; but if the person has a will, then it will be handled in accordance with the will. If there are no relatives who can receive the inheritance according to law, or if the person does not have a will (gifting to friends, gifting to public organizations, or gifting to churches), then the inheritance is nationalized.

　　各取所值与私有财产
  　（杂谈苏联之一）
    茅盾
    大家知道共产主义社会是“各尽所能各取所需”，苏联现在还是社会主义阶段，它现行的办法是“各尽所能，各取所值”。这就是说：工作的报酬是按照工作的难易优劣而有高低的。这是因为：苏联现在的工农业生产还没有发展到能够平均满足人民的一切需要的程度，（请注意“一切需要”这四字），例如还不能无条件给一切需要镶牙的人以镶牙，还不能尽量供给奢侈品（共产主义并不反对享用并不反对奢侈品，相反的，它是主张人人都应该享用奢侈品的，它所反对的是少数人能尽量享受而大多数人连饭都没得吃）；在这情形之下，如果要达到“各取所需”就只有加紧生产，提高生产，苏联用了各种合理的科学的方法以提高生产，而“各取所值”的办法对于加紧生产和提高生产，当然也有帮助的。
    因此苏联人的收入有差别的。然而这高低不一的收入都是劳力（体力的或脑力的）的代价，其中并无丝毫剥削别人的成份在内，甲的收入高，因为他工作努力而又好，乙的收入低，因为他的工作不好又贪懒。工资的评定须得经过民主方式（各产业机关的生产会议），也不是什么经理厂长之流可以凭一人的喜怒好恶随便乱来的。
    苏联人的收入虽有高低，但其差额绝对不会象资本主义国家的个人们的差额那样大。在资本主义国家，一位工厂经理的收入即就其月薪而言，也比他厂中一个小工的月薪多到十倍乃至十倍以上，这还仅仅是他（经理）的月薪呢！工厂赚了钱，分起红利来，经理的份数又比一个小工所得到的多至数十倍。而且工厂的经理一定是股东，他又有股息等等的收入。照这样计算起来，资本主义国家中个人收入的差额是大到百倍千倍万倍而不止的。在苏联，因为只有劳力的代价是人们的收入，故其差额不会很大。苏联的生产机关中，一般的最高与最低的薪给的差额不会超过十倍，没有分红制度，工厂赢利多则用于员工福利事业的经费也就加多。对于工作好的人则有奖励制度，即在正薪以外再按照他的工作成绩（通常是以超过规定生产量的多余的成品件数来计算的），给以额外报酬。有些“斯塔哈诺夫式”的工人他的额外报酬可能与正薪一般大，那么，他的收入就会比同厂的最低薪给者超过十倍了，但这也是他劳力的代价而不是不劳而获。
    劳力所得的代价在苏联是受到尊重的。由劳力所积的财产也是受到尊重的。因此苏联人的个人私有财产是受到法律所保护的。不过，谁要是想利用他的私有财产去做剥削事业，那就为法律所不许可。法律当然不禁止任何人用他的私有财产提高本人的生活享受。收入多的人可以尽量享受。但在苏联社会中，钱多不受人尊敬、钱多而只顾个人的享受，那就非但不受尊敬，反受鄙视。因此，收入多的人（比如每年他的著作可以销行百万部的大作家他的版税收入是很可观的），他们的生活享受可以比别人略高而外，多余的钱往往是捐作公共福利基金（例如作家协会的文艺基金那是专为扶助贫病或年青作家的），或购买政府发行的公债。苏联各大城市的大街上常见有古玩店，这些古玩店的生意特别好，这也是收入多的苏联人消费之一道。苏联法律并不禁止个人收藏凡有历史价值与艺术价值的书籍，图画器皿等等。私人收藏家在苏联还是不少。这些收藏家多数是著名的演员艺员，作家。
    个人的私有财产（包括动产与不动产）可以遗传给自己的子孙，或自己指定的任何人。遗产税这名目，在苏联是没有的。接受遗产的人，不用纳税，但死者如果债务来了，那么，接受遗产的人便有义务还债。苏联的遗产法律规定本人的儿女（包括养儿养女）孙儿女及失去工作能力的直属亲友，有接受遗产的权利；但如果本人有遗嘱，那么，就按照遗嘱办理。如果既无照法律可受遗产的亲属，或本人又没有遗嘱（赠友，赠公共团体，或赠教堂），那么，遗产即收为国有。
