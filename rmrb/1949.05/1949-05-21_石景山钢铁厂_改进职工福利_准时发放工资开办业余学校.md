　　Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

　　Improves Employee Benefits

　　Wages Paid on Time, Vocational School Opened

[Report from this newspaper] Since the formal establishment of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Trade Union on April 30th, it has gradually overcome the tendency of the former Employee Preparatory Committee to neglect employee welfare and cultural and educational work. It is actively rectifying the cooperative, resolving difficulties such as employee transportation, barber services, coal distribution, and wage payments, and establishing an employee vocational school. Issues such as transportation, barber services, and coal distribution were not actively resolved and restored due to administrative emphasis on economic difficulties, which caused dissatisfaction among some employees. The transportation issue has now been properly resolved through negotiations with the Pingjin Railway Bureau: factory employees can ride the two passenger trains to Pingjin on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings, and the one passenger train back to Shijingshan on Sunday afternoons, with tickets issued by the trade union, and fares settled by the factory on a regular basis. Barber shops have been set up in both the Jindingjie Club and the factory, with the trade union issuing low-price barber tickets. The coal distribution issue will be resolved as soon as the vehicle rental fee is approved. The most serious problem with the cooperative in the past was grain purchase: previously, grain purchases were made in shifts by factory departments, but the deadline was too short, and each person could only purchase once, so people often could not buy grain, or could only buy part of their grain. Especially during the recent price fluctuations, employees suffered even greater losses. Now the cooperative has decided that grain purchases will not be divided by factory departments. All factory employees can purchase grain during their free time within the specified five days, and each person can purchase enough in two installments. As for the wage payment issue, the administration previously stipulated that expenses would be settled twice a month, on the 20th and the 5th, but due to poor work efficiency, this was often delayed by one or two days. Now the trade union has forwarded the employees' opinions to the factory, and starting this month, wage payments have returned to normal, settled on the 15th and 30th of each month, so that employees' wages are not affected by price fluctuations and suffer losses. By now, all reasonable welfare benefits of the past have been restored, and employees have expressed satisfaction. In addition, the scattered study groups during the preparatory committee period, which lacked unified leadership, have now been reorganized by the trade union's cultural and educational department, which has established an employee vocational school, divided into culture, technology, and political classes, to strengthen materialist historical education. Enrollment is now full (200 people), and classes will officially begin on the 23rd. However, the trade union still has many shortcomings: such as the leadership's preoccupation with administrative matters, neglecting mass work, failing to grasp comprehensive leadership, and forming a state of anarchy where everyone does their own thing. Also, the lack of investigation and research before work, the failure to formulate work plans, and the lack of inspection and reporting after the event are all unorganized and undisciplined states that must be quickly overcome.

　　石景山钢铁厂
  　改进职工福利
  　准时发放工资开办业余学校
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂正式职工会自四月三十日成立以来，已逐渐克服过去职工筹委会忽视职工福利和文教工作的倾向，积极整顿合作社，解决员工交通车、理发、发煤、发工资等困难，并兴办职工业余学校。交通车、理发、发煤等问题，由于行政上强调经济困难，未积极解决恢复，曾引起部分职工不满；现交通车问题已和平津铁路局接洽妥当：每星期六下午及星期日上午两班赴平客车，及星期日下午一班回石景山客车，钢铁厂职工可凭职工会所发车票搭乘，车资由厂方定期结算。理发室已在金顶街俱乐部及厂内分设两处，由职工会发廉价理发票。发煤问题只等雇车费批下即可发放。合作社以前最严重的是购粮问题：过去购粮是以厂处为单位轮流购买，但限期太短，而且每人只能购买一次，因此往往有人买不到粮食，或只能买到一部分粮食，尤其在最近物价波动期间，职工们损失更大；现在合作社已决定购粮不以厂处划分时间，在规定五天内全厂职工有空闲时间都可以来购粮，而且每人可分两次购足。至于工资发放问题，以前行政上规定每月开支分二十号五号两次结清，但由于工作效率太差，往往要拖延一、两天。现在职工会已将职工们的意见转交厂方，从本月份起发放工资已恢复正常，每月十五号三十号结清，使职工们的工资不致受物价波动的影响而遭受损失。至此，过去所有的合理的福利事业都已恢复，职工们都表示满意。此外，筹委会时期的缺乏统一领导的散漫的学习小组，现经职工会文教部整顿，主办了职工业余学校，分文化、技术、政治三班，加强唯物史观教育。报名现已满额（二百名），二十三日即可正式开学。但职工会还存在着许多缺点：如领导者的事务主义，忽视群众工作，不掌握全面领导，形成各自为政的无政府状态。再如工作上的事先不调查研究，不订出工作计划，事后也不检查不汇报等无组织无纪律状态等等，都必须迅速加以克服。（炽）
