    Taiyuan City Assault First Merit Group
    Glorious PLA 589th Regiment
    The People's Liberation Army's 589th Regiment is the Taiyuan city assault first merit group and also the sharpest and fastest knife regiment that plunged into the enemy's depths after entering the city. On April 24th, before dawn, the People's Liberation Army had approached the walls of Taiyuan from all directions and completed all preparations for the general offensive. The 589th Regiment's city assault troops were concealed seventy or eighty meters east of the Xiaobeimen (Little North Gate) from the city wall, and the soldiers were staring anxiously, waiting for the order to attack. At 5:40 AM, the battle for the general assault on Taiyuan began. Dozens of artillery groups, composed of hundreds of cannons, were fiercely bombarding this breakthrough and its vicinity, completely suppressing the enemy's artillery fire. The 589th Regiment's assault team, not waiting for the scheduled time (scheduled for 7:40 AM), took the lead in bravely scaling the city walls. The regiment ordered the First Company to go first, but the Third Company's ladder team rushed up first. The First Company's First Platoon Deputy, Zhou Youmei, and his ladder team got anxious when they saw this and shouted "Up!" Twelve people picked up the ladder and went up. They jumped over the outer moat, which was one zhang six or seven chi (about 5.3-5.7 meters) deep and wide, destroyed the round fortress on the other side of the moat, and under the cover of the firepower team, the ladder was safely erected at the city wall in just six minutes. Ladder team member Feng Wensheng looked back and saw that the assault team had not yet come up, took out a small red flag and was about to climb the city, but soldier Kong Xiangyuan "swooped" the flag from his hand and said, "I'll go first!" He turned around and quickly climbed up. This was at 6:15 AM, and the small red flag was quickly planted on the Taiyuan city head. The city-scaling troops defeated three counterattacks by the enemy, and the follow-up troops quickly eliminated the enemy's flanking fire blockade. At 6:40 AM, the main force of the regiment had all scaled the city wall. This was the first team of the People's Liberation Army to climb the city wall of Taiyuan. They quickly advanced in separate routes towards the city walls on both sides of the breakthrough and the city center, quickly joining forces with the vanguard of the fraternal troops from the east, west, and south, smashing the enemy's defense system, cutting off and dividing the enemy attempting to retreat from the north city, creating a favorable situation for our follow-up troops to annihilate the enemy separately, shortening the battle time, and reducing our army's casualties and consumption. They made great contributions on the Taiyuan city head.

    太原登城首功团
    光荣的解放军第五八九团
    解放军第五八九团是太原登城首功团，又是登城后向城内敌人纵深插的最快最猛的尖刀团。四月廿四日天还不亮，解放军已从四面八方逼到太原城墙附近，完成了一切总攻准备。五八九团的登城突击部队，隐伏在小北门东离城墙七八十米的地方，战士们把眼睛瞪的圆圆的焦急地等着进攻命令。五时四十分总攻太原城的战斗开始了，几百门大炮组成的几十个炮兵群，正向这个突破口及其附近猛烈轰击，敌人的炮火完全被压制了。五八九团突击队，不等预定时间（预定七时四十分），首先奋勇登城。团的命令一连先上，但三连梯子组却抢先窜上去了。一连一排副周有美带领的梯子组一看急了，喊了声“上！”十二个人抬起梯子就上。他们跳过一丈六、七尺深宽的外壕，击毁了壕那边的圆堡，在火力组掩护下，仅六分钟梯子就安全地在城墙边竖了起来。梯子组冯文生往后看了看突击组还没上来拿出小红旗来正准备登城，战士孔祥元“嗖”的从他手里把旗夺过去说：“我先上！”转身飞快的爬上去了，这时是六时十五分，小红旗迅速地插在太原城头。登城部队打垮了敌人三次反冲锋，后续部队迅速消灭了敌人侧射火力的封锁，六时四十分团主力全部登城，这是解放军登上太原城头的第一个团队。他们迅速分路向突破口两侧城墙和市街中心猛进，迅速与东、西、南三面兄弟部队先锋会师，打烂了敌人的防御系统，切断和割裂了企图从北城退下来的敌人，造成我军后续部队分别歼灭敌人的有利形势，缩短了战斗时间，减少了我军的伤亡和消耗。在太原城头立下大功。
