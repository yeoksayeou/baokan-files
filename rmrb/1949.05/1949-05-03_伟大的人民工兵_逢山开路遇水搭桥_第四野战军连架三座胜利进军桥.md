Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 1st. The engineering battalion of the Fourth Field Army, on its southern expedition, rapidly constructed three large bridges in quick succession. When a certain artillery regiment was held up because a bridge over a river was destroyed, a company from the battalion immediately marched quickly to the riverbank. Without resting or eating, they all jumped into the water and, in one day and one night, built a bridge one hundred meters long and three meters wide, allowing heavy weapons that could not be carried by civilian boats to pass over the bridge. Subsequently, the battalion marched rapidly through heavy rain overnight, erecting a pontoon bridge across another river in ten minutes, allowing an entire division eager to advance to pass smoothly. At that time, ships carrying artillery could not dock because the water was too shallow, so the engineers tirelessly pushed the boats in the water for a whole day, and began building a bridge the next day. They dismantled a large amount of wood and iron nails from nearby enemy bunkers and destroyed iron bridges, overcoming the difficulty of lacking materials. Due to the high level of enthusiasm of the engineers, the bridge, which was originally scheduled to be completed in four days, was completed within twenty-four hours. When rushing to build the third bridge, enemy planes constantly harassed them. All the engineers worked hard in the dim moonlight, and launched a revolutionary competition under the call of "Paving roads through mountains and building bridges over rivers." Many comrades worked while ill, and comrades whose fingers were flattened by wooden beams also refused to rest. Some people carried three sleepers at a time. In order to prevent the fighters who were building the bridge foundation from getting blisters on their hands, the instructor of a certain company took apart his own quilt and gave it to everyone to pad their hands. Finally, in seventy-four hours, they built a bridge that was 240 meters long, 3.4 meters wide, and had a load capacity of 18 tons. The nearby people pointed to the five large characters written by the engineers at the bridgehead with admiration and said: "It is really a 'Victory Advance Bridge'. Last year, a Kuomintang engineering battalion built a small bridge here, and they didn't know how much labor and vehicles the people had to provide, but it took a full month and eight days to build, and even then large trucks couldn't pass."

    伟大的人民工兵
    逢山开路遇水搭桥
    第四野战军连架三座胜利进军桥
    【新华社北平一日电】南征途中的第四野战军工兵某营以短促的时间连续抢架三座大桥。当某炮兵团因某河桥梁被毁而受阻时，该营一连立即以强行军赶到河边，不等休息和吃饭，便全体跳下水去，在一天一夜间架起一座三米宽的百米长桥，使民船无法载运的重武器从桥上通过。随后该营又冒着大雨连夜以急行军前进，在另一道河以十分钟时间搭起一座浮囊桥，使急于前进的整师人马顺利通过。当时载运炮兵的船只因水浅不能靠岸，工兵们又不顾疲劳地在水里推了一天船，并于第二天即开始架桥。他们从附近敌人遗弃的碉堡和破坏了的铁桥拆卸下来大批木材、铁钉，克服了材料缺乏的困难。由于工兵们的高度的积极性，使原来限期四天完成的大桥于二十四小时内修竣。抢架第三座大桥时，敌机不断袭扰，全体工兵便在朦胧的月光中加紧劳作，并在“逢山开路、遇水搭桥”的号召下展开了革命竞赛。许多同志带病工作，被道木压扁了指头的同志也拒绝休息，有的人每次扛三根枕木。为了不使打桥基的战士们双手磨泡，某连指导员把自己的棉被拆给大家垫手，终于在七十四小时内，他们架起一了座长二百四十米、宽三米四、载重十八吨的大桥。附近老百姓以惊叹的眼光指着工兵们在桥头写的五个大字说：“真是‘胜利进军桥’呀，去年国民党一个工兵营在这里修一道小桥，不知叫老百姓出了多少人工车辆，但整整修了一个月零八天，还不能走大车”。
