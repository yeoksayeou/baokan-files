    Celebrating "May 12th" to Salute the People's Medical Workers in All Liberated Areas
    This year's "May 12th" International Nurses Day comes on the eve of the liberation of all of China. We will celebrate and commemorate this festival in all the people's cities. We would like to extend our highest regards and salute to the "People's Heroes," "Rescue Heroes," "Model Workers," and all the people's medical workers on the front and rear sanitation work lines!
    Supported by the democratic regime and nurtured by the people, health workers have formed an unprecedented "health army." On the front lines, thousands upon thousands of male and female medical personnel are advancing and retreating side-by-side with commanders and fighters of the field army, not afraid of sacrificing blood to rescue wounded revolutionary comrades, truly achieving "wherever there are wounded, medical personnel will be there to rescue them." This heroic and invincible spirit has strengthened the commanders' determination to fight and enhanced the soldiers' confidence in victory.
    Recalling the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the People's Liberation War, our health army has not only greatly developed in number, but also unprecedentedly improved in the theoretical technology of military epidemic prevention, medical treatment, sanitation, and rescue. For example, the new method of treating war wounds has been popularized throughout the liberated areas, and is not only regarded as a standard by medical personnel, but also deeply believed by wounded comrades. Therefore, treatment efficiency has gradually improved. The return-to-duty rate after injury increased from 61.2% in 1946 to 64.2% in 1948. The disability rate after injury decreased from 8.8% in 1946 to 3.2% in 1947 (see comprehensive statistics on war wounds in the North China Military Region). During the famous seven battles and seven victories in central Jiangsu, 50% of the wounded admitted to five military hospitals were able to return to their units after one month of treatment (see "In the Wounded Soldiers' Hospital"). In the first half of 1948, the average cure and return rate for war wounds in the East China Military Region was 68.6%. Although this achievement surpasses the past, it is still far from the Soviet Union's return rate of 75-78% during World War II, and we should continue to work hard. In terms of war wound prevention medicine, we universally adopted tetanus toxoid and post-injury tetanus antitoxin injections and early debridement in 1948, reducing the incidence rate to less than 1%, and eliminating the fear of injury among commanders and fighters. In the process of war wound rescue and medical treatment, the Northeast Military Region has a "tiered treatment" regulation to ensure the consistency of treatment principles between the front line, supply stations, and rear treatment institutions. The East China Military Region created the "fast stretcher" that travels ten miles in one hour and the mass self-rescue and mutual-aid "universal bandage movement" and "self-bandage movement," thus obtaining early surgical treatment and avoiding the creation of infection, reducing battlefield bleeding and shock casualties due to delayed rescue. Other factors, such as the "cold prevention and insulation method," graded triage reporting, research and improvement of wounded soldiers' nutrition, and the widespread use of chemical therapy, are major factors in reducing the pain and sacrifice of wounded soldiers, exerting medical care functions, and returning to the team as soon as possible after recovery.
    As for persisting in the Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines, the rescue of wounded soldiers relied on the loyal assistance of the people, who hid them in the homes of ordinary people, or transferred them to mountain caves, reed ponds, and underground hospitals (there used to be such underground facilities in the Hebei-Central and Western Shandong plains). This kind of arduous struggle life is beyond the dreams of ordinary medical personnel.
    Medical personnel are brave in rescuing the wounded on the front line. The heroic and skilled combat exploits of a certain column in East China, conquering everything, have spread throughout East China, and their medical personnel, in cooperation with combatants, have entered and exited the front line, demonstrating a noble spirit of fearlessness.
    Comrade Xu Genzhu, the Communist Party member and excellent veteran cadre who was the director of the Second Rear Hospital of the Northwest Military Region, was bombed by American-made Chiang planes in the cave where he was performing surgery in the field hospital, and bled his last drop of blood. Comrade Shen Zhiyong, a medical worker from the Kaiyuan Department of the Northeast Military Region, gloriously sacrificed himself while rescuing wounded soldiers in the fire of the battle of Zhangwu City. Comrade Liu Jingying, the "Red Rescue Hero," contributed his life in the battle of Nanshanchengzi. There are many heroes like this who are loyal, brave, and unafraid of sacrifice in performing front-line rescue missions and contributing their lives to the liberation cause of the nation and the people. On this International Nurses Day, we should deeply mourn them and consider this to be the glory of our party, the people, and the people's medical workers.
    In the cities and villages, factories and mines, organs, schools, and troops of the rear liberated areas; in hospitals, sanatoriums, clinics, and epidemic prevention teams at all levels; in medical schools, pharmaceutical factories, and positions in nurseries and kindergartens; in the kitchens: our medical personnel are working selflessly year after year to protect the health of workers, peasants, working masses, and revolutionary comrades of the troops, to heal the pain of patients, to improve food and nutrition, to improve sanitary conditions, and to nurture revolutionary descendants, protecting combat effectiveness and labor power to support the front lines and ensure production and construction. In these works, a large number of people's heroes and model workers have emerged, which is something we are proud of. However, comrades, this does not mean that we have no shortcomings. On the contrary, our medical theory and technical level are still low, our sanitation and medical equipment is still very insufficient, and the number of our sanitation and medical personnel is still small, far from meeting the needs of the people. In the entire revolutionary cause and the revolutionary process, we are still very small, and we have only taken the first step in the Long March. The national epidemic prevention facilities and medical standards are still very low, and many reforms and constructions are waiting for all of us medical personnel to improve and realize.
    The victory of the revolution has expanded the scope of our work. First of all, we must unite all medical and health workers, and humbly learn advanced medical theories and technologies from each other to improve our level. We must organize all forces to strive to complete the task of "developing mass health work and establishing a health care unit in each county as needed and as possible," and strive to complete the task of "establishing a clinic in each factory." We must strengthen the concept and implementation of preventive medicine and use modern technology to prevent and eliminate several major controllable infectious diseases, such as smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, typhus, relapsing fever, and plague. Secondly, we must train more senior and junior medical personnel and maternal and child health workers to replenish the rescue forces on the front lines and open up a vast rural health construction cause. Thirdly, we must expand and add pharmaceutical factories, sanitary equipment factories, and biochemical manufacturing factories to greatly increase production to meet current needs. Finally, we must enrich and expand all good examples of medical personnel to seek planned and step-by-step coordinated completion of the new democratic New China's health construction cause to commemorate Nightingale and Nurses' Day.

### 庆祝“五一二”向全解放区的人民医护工作者致敬

    庆祝“五一二”向全解放区的人民医护工作者致敬
    本年“五一二”国际护士节，是处在解放全中国的前夜。我们将在所有的人民城市，庆祝与纪念这个节日，我们谨向在前线在后方卫生工作战线上的“人民功臣”“救护英雄”“模范工作者”以及全体的人民医护工作者致以崇高的慰问与敬礼！
    卫生工作者在民主政权扶植之下，受着人民的抚育，形成了史无前例的“卫生大军”。在火线上，成千成万的男女医护人员，和野战军指战员，并肩协同进退，不怕牺牲流血抢救负伤的革命同志，真正作到“伤员在哪里，医护人员救护就到哪里”。这种英勇无敌的气概，加强了指挥员的战斗决心，也提高了战士们胜利信心。
    回忆八年抗日战争与三年的人民解放战争以来，我们的卫生大军，不仅数量上有了很大的发展，就是在军事防疫、医疗、卫生、救护的理论技术上，也空前的提高了。例如：战伤新法治疗，已普及到全解放区，不但医疗人员，奉为圭臬；就是伤员同志也信仰之至。因此治疗效率，逐渐的获得进步。伤愈归队率：一九四六年为六一·二，而一九四八年就提高为六四·二。伤后残废率：一九四六年为八·八而一九四七年则降低到三·二（见华北两军区战伤综合统计）。有名的苏中七战七捷时，五个军医院所收容的伤员，经治疗一个月，就有百分之五十的伤愈归队者（见“在伤兵医院中”），华东军区一九四八年上半年，战伤治愈归除率，平均为六八·六。这宗成绩，虽然超越了过去，但比较第二次世界大战，苏联的归队率为七五——七八，我们相去还远，我们还应该努力。在战伤预防医学方面，我们在一九四八年普遍的采用破伤风类毒素以及负伤后破伤风抗毒素注射，与早期扩创，而使发生率减少百分之一以下，消除了指战员受伤后的恐怖心理。在战伤救护医疗过程中，东北军区有“阶梯治疗”之规定，以保证火线、兵站、与后方治疗机关治疗方针的一致性；华东军区，创造了一小时行程十里的“快速担架”，与群众性自救救人的“普包运动”与“自包运动”，因此获得早期的手术治疗与避免创造传染，使因救护失时的战场流血伤亡及休克伤亡获得减少。其他如“防寒保温法”逐级检伤通报、伤员的营养研究与改进，化学治疗的广泛采用，均为减少伤员痛苦牺牲，发挥医护功能，早日伤愈回队之主要因素。
    至于敌后坚持抗战，对伤员之救护，则依靠人民群众之忠诚协助，隐蔽在老百姓的家里，或转移山洞、苇塘，以及隐藏在地下医院中（在冀中、鲁西平原，曾经有过此项地下设施），这种艰苦的斗争生活，为平常医护人员梦想所不及。
    医护人员在第一线抢救伤员，是勇敢的。华东某纵队之英勇善战，攻无不克的事迹，已传遍华东，而他们的医疗人员，协同战斗员，进出火线，表现了高尚的大无畏的精神。
    西北军区第二后方医院院长，共产党员，优秀的老干部徐根竹同志，在战地医院行手术的窑洞里，被美制蒋机所轰炸，流尽他最后一点血；东北军区开原部医疗员沈智勇同志，在彰武城战斗中，为抢救火网中的伤员而光荣牺牲；“红色救护英雄”刘景瀛同志，在南山城子战斗中，贡献了他的生命，象这样忠勇的不怕牺牲的执行火线救护任务，而贡献生命给民族人民的解放事业的英雄们，是很多的，值此国际护士节日，我们应该深深的悼念他们，应该认为这是我们党和人民以及人民医护工作者的光荣。
    在后方解放区的城市和乡村工厂矿山，机关学校部队里，各级卫生机关医院、疗养院、门诊部、防疫队里；在医护学校，在制药厂，在保育院托儿所的岗位上；在伙房内：我们的医护人员，为着保卫工人农民劳苦群众与部队革命同志的健康，医治病人的痛苦，改善伙食营养，改进卫生状况，保育革命的后代，而年复一年忘我的工作着，保护战斗力与劳动力，以支援前线及保证生产建设，在这些工作当中，我们涌现了广大数量的人民功臣、模范工作者，这是值得我们骄傲的。但是同志们，这不等于我们就没有缺点了，相反的我们的医学理论技术水准还低，我们卫生医药设备还很不够，我们卫生医护人员数量还少，远赶不上人民的需要，在整个革命事业与革命过程中，我们还渺小的很，只是万里长征走了第一步，全国的防疫设施，医药水准还很低，有许多改革与建树都待我们全体医护人员提高和实现。
    革命的胜利，使我们的工作范围扩大了，我们首先要团结一切医护卫生各界人士，虚心的相互学习先进的医学理论与技术，以提高我们的水准；要组织一切的力量，为完成“开展群众卫生工作，按需要和可能，每县设立一个卫生医疗单位”的任务而努力；为“每个工厂建立一个医务所”的任务而努力；我们要加强预防医学的观念和实施，运用现代技术以防止和消灭几种主要的可以管制的传染病发生和流行，如天花、霍乱、伤寒、斑疹伤寒、回归热、鼠疫诸病。其次我们要培养更多的高级和初级医护人员，与妇婴卫生工作者，以充实前方的救护力量与开辟广大农村卫生建设事业。再次我们要扩充与添设制药厂卫生器械厂及生化制造厂使大量增产，以应当前需要。最后我们要将医护人员一切好的范例加以充实与扩大，以求得有计划有步骤协同一致的完成新民主主义的新中国卫生建设事业来纪念南丁格尔和护士节。
