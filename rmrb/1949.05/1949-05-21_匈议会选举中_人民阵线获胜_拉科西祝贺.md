Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 19th: TASS, Budapest: Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, addressed a mass rally in Budapest on the evening of the 16th, congratulating the working people on the victory won by the People's Independence Front in the parliamentary elections held on the 15th. Rákosi declared: Now we can say with certainty that the people throughout the country support us wholeheartedly. The prestige and influence of the party leading the country—the Hungarian Working People's Party—has increased. The results of the elections in various regions prove that the people approve of the Five-Year Plan. It is not only a moving demonstration of support for Hungary's peaceful policy, but also a moving demonstration of support for the entire progressive international peace front led by the Soviet Union.
    Rákosi emphasized: The Hungarian Communists are very pleased to point out that the Hungarian people have so sincerely expressed their trust in the People's Independence Front and our Party. He pointed out: However, we do not forget for a minute that all that we have accomplished is only just the beginning, and the increasing trust of the people increases our sense of responsibility. Since we have obtained the wholehearted and enthusiastic support of the working people, we must complete all the great tasks before us with new determination and new strength—that is, to realize the Five-Year Plan and strengthen the task of defending peace.
    Rákosi concluded: "When we achieve every success, my heart is filled with gratitude to our liberator—the powerful Soviet Union and its wise leader and friend of our people, the great Stalin. We must first of all thank them for our freedom today, for the belief with which we look to the future."

　　匈议会选举中
    人民阵线获胜
  　拉科西祝贺
    【新华社北平十九日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：十六日晚，匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西在布达佩斯群众大会上讲演，就人民独立阵线在十五日举行的议会选举中所赢得的胜利，向劳动人民祝贺。拉科西宣称：现在我们可以肯定地说，全国各地人民都全心全意地支持我们。领导国家的党——匈牙利劳动人民党的威信与影响增长了。各地选举的结果证明人民赞同五年计划。它不仅是拥护匈牙利和平政策的动人的表现，而且也是拥护以苏联为首的整个进步的国际和平阵线的动人的表现。
    拉科西力称：匈牙利共产党人十分高兴地指出，匈牙利人民如此诚心地表示他们对人民独立阵线与我党的信任。他指出：但是，我们一分钟也不忘记，我们所已完成的一切，还不过是刚刚开头，而人民对于我们与日俱增的信任却加重了我们的责任心，既然取得了劳动人民全心全意地热烈的拥护，我们必须以新的决心和新的力量来完成摆在我们面前的一切巨大任务——这就是实现五年计划，加强保卫和平的任务。
    拉科西结语称：“当我们获得每一个成就的时候，我的心里都充满着对我们的解放者——强大的苏联及其英明领袖和我们人民的朋友伟大斯大林的感激。我们首先要为我们今天的自由，要为我们用以瞻望将来的信念而感谢他们”。
