　　We Need Short Works!
　　Since the launch of the "Weekly Literature and Art" supplement, we have received many letters and manuscripts from readers and authors. Some say: "We welcome the arrival of the literature and art supplement!" Some say: "We hope to publish more concise and incisive literary works!" Some say: "We hope for literary theory with guiding significance!" Some say: "We should add book reviews, drama reviews, and film reviews!"
　　We agree with these requests and hope that workers, peasants, soldiers and their cadres, literature and art enthusiasts, students, writers, painters, and poets from all over the country will send us more "concise and incisive" articles. Because according to the current submissions, most are lengthy reports, clappers, songs, long poems, and lengthy theories. Even book reviews and scripts are written with thousands of words or more. In order to emphasize the ideological content of literature and art and to make the layout lively, these articles, which are numerous in quantity but poor in quality, are difficult to publish!
　　In the future, we hope to have short commentaries that can solve problems and provide guidance; we hope to have more profound drama reviews, film reviews, and book reviews with new insights; we hope to have poems and songs with thought, emotion, and fresh styles; we hope to have brief, brilliant, character-driven, story-driven, and vividly concrete reportage; we hope to have short articles using literary techniques to write about learning and ideological remoulding. In terms of writing style, we require clarity, accessibility, easy reading, and easy understanding, while still expressing profound meanings.——We want to create a new writing style to express the realistic content of this new era!

### 我们需要短作品！

专栏：

　　我们需要短作品！
    星期文艺发刊后，接到读者、作者很多的信和稿件。有的说：“我们欢迎文艺副刊的到来！”有的说：“希望多发一些短小精悍的文艺作品！”有的说：“希望有指导作用的文艺理论！”有的说：“应该添设书评、剧评、影评！”
    我们同意这些要求，希望各地工农兵及其干部、文艺爱好者、学生、作家、画家、诗人多给我们寄些“短小精悍”的文章。因为根据现在来稿的情形，多是长篇的报告、快板、歌曲、长诗、长篇理论，即使是书评、剧本也写的在几千字以上。为了重视文艺的思想内容，排版力求活泼，这些量多质差的文章，就很难发出去了！
    今后，希望有能解决问题、有指导作用的短评；希望有比较深刻、有新见解的剧评、影评、书评；希望有思想、有情感、有新鲜风格的诗、歌曲；希望有简短、精采、有人物、故事、生动具体的报告文学；希望有用文艺手法写学习、思想改造的短文。在文字上，要求简明、通俗、容易读、容易懂，而又能表达深刻的意思。——我们要创造新的文风，来表现这个新时代的现实内容！
