Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 15th: Publicly owned factories and enterprises in Peiping Municipality have recently been formulating production plans as a basis for restoring and developing production. The formulation of production plans was one of the main topics discussed at a meeting convened on the 28th of last month by the Peiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which gathered managers and factory directors from various publicly owned enterprises. At that meeting, it was agreed that the formulation of production plans is an important measure to overcome the anarchy of production and implement enterprise-oriented management. More than a dozen production units, including tap water, trams, automobiles, coal mines, paper making, glass, woolen textile, and pharmaceuticals, have already formulated production plans.

This time, the formulation of production plans by various factories and enterprises is generally based on the needs of social life and the specific conditions of production equipment, and it also incorporates the opinions of workers and staff. Finally, it is reviewed and approved by the Peiping Municipal Government Enterprise Bureau for implementation. When formulating production plans, various units, focusing on the overall production goals and plans of each unit, also formulated their own specific plans for each department and group. For example, the central task of the Tram Company in the future is to rebuild and increase the number of vehicles. The plan is to have 100 trams running on the lines starting in November, and to repair 10 spare trams. With this as the center, the Civil Engineering Section plans to repair damaged tracks and add curves to ensure traffic safety and increase the number of trips. The Power Supply Section plans to maintain uninterrupted power supply, improve mechanical safety equipment, and increase mechanical efficiency.

Each mine under the Pingxi Coal Mining Company has also formulated specific divisions of labor and tasks for each month, each department, each production team, and even each individual, based on its specific conditions and the overall annual production task, so as to facilitate timely inspection. In addition to proposing production targets, the production plans of various units also propose schemes related to improving management institutions, adjusting personnel allocation, adding equipment, and establishing various systems. Each mine under the Pingxi Coal Mining Company plans to establish systems for attendance, output registration, budget for expenditure, factory regulations, and mine regulations, and prepare to reorganize and equip the personnel and equipment of various departments. Regarding the problem of preventing water from flooding the mines, each mine also has specific plans. The production plan of the Yanjing Paper Mill also includes provisions on establishing a unified leadership and a system of responsibility at each level, repairing machines, and establishing meeting reporting systems.

When formulating plans, each unit generally paid attention to its own characteristics. For example, the Soy Sauce Factory, in view of the fact that semi-finished products must undergo a three-month fermentation period before they can be shipped, divided the annual production plan into four stages, with each stage lasting three months. Some purely consumable products, such as "ice making," are planned to maintain a certain production standard and are not intended to be expanded on a large scale. For enterprises and factories whose plans have funding difficulties, the Peiping Municipal Government Enterprise Bureau will provide investment based on their specific circumstances. For example, the Yanjing Paper Mill has already received an investment of 10 million RMB for the purpose of adding digesters and purchasing raw materials. The newly built Pharmaceutical Factory will also receive an investment of 6 million RMB from the Enterprise Bureau within the first month after the production plan is formulated.

Currently, the main production volumes in the plans of various publicly owned enterprises approved by the Peiping Municipal Enterprise Bureau are: Among the mines under the Pingxi Coal Mining Company, the Mentougou Mine will produce 434,450 tons of coal in one year (from May of this year to April of next year); the Chengzi Mine will produce 144,100 tons of coal. The total production volume of the Yanjing Paper Mill this year (eight months) is 56,000 reams (equivalent to 2.25 million pounds). The Peiping Tram Company plans to increase the total number of vehicles in the factory to 140 (currently 73) by the end of April next year. The Qinghe Woolen Mill plans to produce 24,000 meters of printing flannel, 32,000 meters of coarse flannel, and 70,000 blankets this year.

　　根据社会需要拟订生产计划
  　平公营工厂企业化
    市府企业局投资帮助资金困难者
    【新华社北平十五日电】北平市各公营企业工厂，最近纷纷拟订生产计划，以为恢复与发展生产的依据。制订生产计划是上月二十八日中共北平市委会召集各公营企业经理、厂长等集会时讨论的主题之一。该次会议上，大家认为订定生产计划是克服生产的无政府现象和实行企业化的重要措施。目前已订定生产计划者有自来水、电车、汽车、煤矿、造纸、玻璃、制呢、制药等十多个生产单位。此次各工厂企业订定生产计划，一般都是根据社会生活的需要及生产设备的具体条件而拟订，并吸收了职工群众的意见，最后由北平市政府企业局研讨后批准执行。各单位订定生产计划时，围绕着各单位总的生产目标与计划，各部门及各小组亦订定了自己的具体计划。如电车公司今后的中心任务是重建车辆与增加车辆，计划从十一月份开始，在线路上行驶一百部车，并修出备用车十部。以此为中心，土木课即计划补修坏的轨道，添设弯道，以保障行车安全及增加行车次数。供电课则计划不停电，改善机械安全设备，增加机械效能等。平西煤矿公司所属各矿亦均根据其具体条件及一年生产总任务，做出每一个月，每一部门，每一生产小组以至每个人的具体分工与任务，以便随时检查。各单位生产计划中除提出生产目标外，还提出有关健全管理机构，调整人员配备，增添设备，建立各种制度等等方案。平西煤矿公司所属各矿均计划建立考勤，产量登记，经费开支预算，厂规，矿规等制度，并准备重新组织配备各部门的人员与器具。关于防水淹没矿井问题，各矿亦有具体计划。燕京造纸厂的生产计划中亦有关于建立统一领导与逐级负责制、修建机器、建立会议汇报等制度的规定，各单位制定计划时，一般都注意了本身的特点。如酱油厂鉴于半成品须经三个月的酝酿期始能出货，乃将一年生产计划分为四个阶段，每三个月为一阶段。有些纯属消耗品生产的如“制冰”则计划维持一定生产标准，不拟大量扩展。各企业工厂计划中有资金困难者，北平市政府企业局均根据其具体情况予以投资。如燕京造纸厂已获得投资一千万人民币，为添置蒸煮器和购买原料之用。新建制药厂在订定生产计划后第一个月内，亦将得到企业局六百万人民币的投资。目前经北平市企业局批准的各公营企业计划中的生产量主要有：平西煤矿公司所属各矿中，门头沟矿一年（今年五月至明年四月）中产煤四十三万四千四百五十万吨；城子矿产煤十四万四千一百吨。燕京纸厂本年度（八个月）生产总量为五万六千令（合二百二十五万磅）。北平电车公司计划在明年四月底前将全厂车辆增至一百四十辆（现有七十三辆）。清河制呢厂计划在今年内产印刷呢二万四千公尺，粗呢三万二千公尺，毛毯七万条。
