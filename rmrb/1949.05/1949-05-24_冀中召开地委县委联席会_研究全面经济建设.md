Jizhong Holds Joint Meeting of Prefectural and County Party Committees
　　Studying Comprehensive Economic Construction
　　Why Shift the Focus of Work to Cities?
　　Restoring and Developing Industrial Production is Key to Building Cities

[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of 120 people from various prefectural and county party committees on May 2 to arrange the current economic construction work and agricultural production work in Jizhong under the new situation. After deliberation and discussion, the participating cadres initially recognized the importance of urban work, began to understand the Party's policies on labor-capital mutual benefit, public-private partnership, urban-rural relations, and internal-external relations; they gained a deeper understanding of the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy; at the same time, they overcame to a considerable extent the narrow rural viewpoints and localist viewpoints of some cadres. This laid the foundation for implementing the Party's new tasks in the future.

During the discussion, everyone had many confused ideas about the current new urban-rural relationship, such as only one-sidedly believing that there are more farmers in rural areas and fewer workers in cities, and that farmers have made great contributions in the long revolutionary war, while workers are not as good as farmers in this respect because the cities were liberated later. Why shift the focus of work to the cities, and why should the cities lead the countryside? The conclusion pointed out: We already have large cities and a large number of medium-sized cities. China's proletariat and about 10% of China's national economy, industry in general, are concentrated in these cities. To transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country, we must rely on the proletariat and shift the focus of work from rural areas to cities. However, specifically to prefectural committees and below, because their subordinate areas are almost entirely rural, and the towns also have a strong rural character, the work is still in the countryside. But in order to develop industry, in terms of guiding ideology and specific rural work, we must enable the countryside to supply the cities with large quantities of industrial raw materials and grain. For this reason, we must strive to increase the output of agricultural products. On the other hand, the cities must also supply the farmers with necessities and production tools.

Relying on the Working Class to Build People's Cities

Regarding relying on the working class to build cities, at first everyone's understanding was insufficient, and many cadres in the past were out of touch with the workers and relaxed their work with the workers. In this regard, the District Committee's conclusion pointed out: We are the vanguard of the proletariat, and we must consciously rely on the working class when we enter the cities. At the same time, proposing today to rely on the working class in the cities does not negate the great contributions of the farmers in the long revolutionary war and construction. After the liberation of large cities, some people simply start from the current interests of the farmers and express regret for the decline of some unprofitable handicraft and sideline production. This understanding is wrong. After the liberation of large cities, it is inevitable that the advanced machine industry will replace part of the handicraft industry in rural areas and small and medium-sized towns, and we should actively guide its transformation.

Regarding the economic construction work of Jizhong under the new situation, the District Committee's conclusion pointed out: In the future, the central key to managing and building cities is to restore and develop industrial production. According to the instructions of the higher-level Party and the specific situation in our region, the following work should be done in economic construction: 1. To promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the supply and marketing trade work in the future should promote the development of industrial production and agricultural production according to the needs of urban and rural areas, and ensure a certain amount of import and export trade. In the operation of the current main materials, we should first maintain the profit of cotton and peanut oil materials. For grain, we should grasp the regulation of regional and seasonal aspects and maintain appropriate price stability. For necessities such as coal and salt, we should adopt the policy of small profits and quick turnover to supply the people's needs, exchange for industrial raw materials, and recover part of the currency to maintain appropriate price stability. Regarding financial work, the current general policy is: to support the restoration and development of urban industrial production and rural agricultural and handicraft production, and first support state-owned enterprises, cultivate their advantages, and make them the leading force in the national economy. Secondly, to assist the development of the cooperative economy and make it an assistant to the national economy. Necessary assistance will also be given to private capital that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Opportunities for circulation and turnover will also be given to commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and can play a role in regulating materials between urban and rural areas. Small loans should be organized for production as a prerequisite to overcome the view of bestowing charity. We should explain the policies and encourage all legitimate operations that are beneficial to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and we must strictly manage and restrict speculators who disrupt the market. 2. Industrial and handicraft production: At present, our region's industrial, handicraft, and sideline production should be handled according to the following principles: First, those that can be replaced by industrial production in large cities should be actively reduced in production or organized for transformation in a planned way. Second, those that cannot be replaced by industrial production in large cities and are needed by the masses and have sales should be developed in a planned way. And according to the needs of urban industry; develop various semi-finished industrial handicrafts. Third, although a certain industry in the city has been restored, the output is still insufficient and the supply cannot meet the demand, and our region has an old foundation, its existence should be continued to be maintained. We should lead and assist the development of all private industrial production that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. 3. For the old cooperatives, except for individual ones that are completely separated from the masses, we generally adopt the policy of transforming them on the old foundation. The central issue is to follow the mass line.

　　冀中召开地委县委联席会
  　研究全面经济建设
    为什么将工作重心移到城市？
    恢复发展工业生产是建设城市的关键
    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委，于五月二日召开各地委县委一百二十人的联席会议，布置了在新形势下冀中当前的经济建设工作，及农业生产工作。经过酝酿讨论，与会干部初步认识了城市工作的重要性，开始了解了党的劳资两利、公私兼顾、城乡关系、内外关系诸政策；对国营经济与合作经济，有了进一步的认识；同时对某些干部狭隘的农村观点和地方主义观点；也有相当的克服。给今后贯彻执行全党新的任务，打下了基础。
    在讨论过程中，大家对目前新的城乡关系，存在不少糊涂观念，如只片面的认为农村多农民多，城市少工人少，农民在长期革命战争中供献大，而工人则因城市解放晚，在这方面不如农民，为什么将工作重心移到城市，并由城市领导乡村呢？结论中指出：我们已有了大城市和一大批中等城市，中国的无产阶级及中国国民经济中百分之十左右的工业，一般集中在这些城市，要想由农业国变为工业国，必须依靠无产阶级，把工作重心由农村移到城市里来。但具体到地委以下机关，因其所属地区，几乎全部为农村，而城镇亦带有很大的农村性，所以工作仍在农村。但为了发展工业，在领导思想上及农村具体工作上，必须使农村能够供给城市大量的工业原料和粮食，为此就必须努力提高农业品产量。另一方面，亦须由城市供给农民必需品和生产工具。
    依靠工人阶级建设人民城市
    关于依靠工人阶级建设城市，起初大家亦认识不足，很多干部过去与工人格格不入，放松工人工作。对此。区党委结论中指出：我们是无产阶级的先锋队，进入城市就必须自觉的依靠工人阶级。同时，今天提出在城市依靠工人阶级，并非否定农民在长期革命战争与建设中的伟大功绩，大城市解放后，有些人单纯从农民目前利益出发，对某些无利可图的手工业副业生产的衰落表示可惜，这种认识是错误的。大城市解放后，进步的机器工业代替了农村及中小城镇的一部分手工业是必然的，我们应主动的领导其转业。
    关于新情势下冀中的经济建设工作，区党委结论中指出：今后管理和建设城市，中心关键是恢复和发展工业生产。根据上级党的指示及我区具体情况，在经济建设上应作以下工作：一、为促使城乡物资交流，今后供销贸易工作，根据城乡需要，促进工业生产与农业生产的发展，并保证一定之进出口贸易。对于当前主要物资的经营上，应首先保持棉花、花生油料的利润。对于粮食，应掌握调剂地区性与季节性，保持粮价适当的平稳。对煤盐等必需品，采取薄利广销的方针，以供民需，换取工业原料与回笼一部货币，以保持物价的适当平稳。关于金融工作，目前总方针是：扶植城市的工业生产与乡村的农业手工业生产的恢复与发展，并首先扶植国营企业，培养其优势，使之成为国民经济中的领导力量。其次是协助合作经济的发展，使之成为国家经济的助手。对有利于国计民生的私人资本，亦予以必要的协助。对有利于国计民生能起城乡物资调剂作用的商业，亦予以通融周转的机会。对于小本贷款，以组织生产为前提，克服恩赐赈济观点。对一切有益于城乡物资交换的正当经营，应讲明政策予以鼓励，而对于扰乱市场的投机商人，则必须严加管理，给以限制。二、工业与手工业生产：目前我区工业、手工业、副业生产，应按以下原则来处理：第一、大城市工业生产已能代替者，应主动的有步骤的减缩其生产，或组织转业。第二，大城市工业生产不能代替，而又为群众所需有销路者，应有计划的发展。并根据城市工业的需要；发展各种半成品的工业手工业。第三、城市某种工业虽已恢复，但产量还不足，供不应求，而我区又有旧基础者，应继续维持其存在。对一切有利于国计民生的私营工业生产，应是领导与扶助其发展。三、对于旧有的合作社，除个别完全脱离群众者以外，一般采取在旧有基础上改造的方针，中心问题是走群众路线。
