    After the transferring personnel Shi Zhiren (former Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau), Wang Yuyi (former Deputy Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau), and Zheng Xi (acting Director of the North Section Management Office of the Pingjin Railway) spoke successively, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan delivered a speech, emphasizing the significance of the railway handover, stating that the people's railway will no longer be a tool for exploiting and oppressing the people, but a tool for serving the people.

Lu Wen, Deputy Director of the Railway Department, introduced the heroes and models in this takeover, and then awards were presented, divided into four grades: award flags, medals, bonuses, and commendations. A total of 941 people and 51 units were awarded. Among them, Zhang Guoxi, He Weixian, and Yang Zhenrong from the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, who were unwilling to transport Kuomintang personnel fleeing north, rescued locomotives from Yongdingmen to Fengtai amidst artillery fire, received certificates and a bonus of 10,000 yuan each. After the liberation of Beiping, the leaders of the Pingbao Road Construction Office organized the Changxindian and Fengtai Engineering Sections to rush-repair the Pingmen branch line, completing the task in 25 hours of continuous work, ensuring that 2,000 tons of coal stored on the railway could be transported to the Shijingshan Power Plant in time, enabling the entire city to be brightly lit on the day the Liberation Army entered the city. At that time, Mayor Ye and Comrade Peng Zhen gave verbal commendations. Therefore, the Pingbao Road Construction Office was awarded an award flag.
