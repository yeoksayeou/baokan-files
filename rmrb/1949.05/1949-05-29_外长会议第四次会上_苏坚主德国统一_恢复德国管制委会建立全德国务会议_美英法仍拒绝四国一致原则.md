Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 28th: TASS Paris reports: The Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held their fourth meeting on May 26th to continue debating the issue of German reunification and the Soviet Union's proposals on this matter. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson chaired the meeting.

At the request of French Foreign Minister Schuman, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky re-explained the Soviet government's two proposals for restoring the German Control Council and establishing an All-German Council of Ministers. Vyshinsky continued by saying that Schuman regarded the part of the Soviet proposal concerning economic institutions with a certain degree of distrust. Schuman asked: Why does the Soviet proposal only mention German economic institutions and not any other institutions? Vyshinsky said the reason was simple: there are currently no other appropriate German institutions in the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany. The Soviet proposal is based on what actually exists. The Soviet government believes that German unity must be built with what is available, using the existing bricks and tiles to build the house.

Although Acheson, speaking after Vyshinsky, also said that the Soviet proposals were "clear and precise," the representatives of the Western countries continued to raise vague and uncertain objections to the Soviet proposals, as in the past, without putting forward any constructive proposals of their own.

Acheson's speech insisted that the Soviet proposals were irrelevant to the essence of the matter and only concerned "organizational aspects, issues of an institutional nature." Acheson reiterated his opinion from yesterday that the issue of rebuilding the Four-Power Control Council could only be resolved after the various economic problems related to Germany were studied and resolved. Acheson also believed that the Soviet proposals "ultimately amount to rebuilding the Allied Control Council, which can only take decisions based on unanimous agreement." Here, he clearly indicated their unwillingness to accept the Soviet delegation's proposal to restore the activities of the Allied Control Council precisely because they opposed the principle of unanimous agreement.

Schuman then declared that it was still "quite difficult" to understand Vyshinsky's proposals. He expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet proposal to establish an All-German Council of Ministers, saying that, in his view, it was impossible to achieve. Like Acheson, Schuman did not clearly state what the French delegation wanted.

Bevin's speech was more definite. He said: "The main point of disagreement here is that the proposal currently put forward in the form of an All-German Council of Ministers is different from what exists in the Western zones. This difference is absolutely clear." Following Acheson, Bevin said he also believed that some economic problems must be resolved before the Four-Power Control Council could be restored.

Vyshinsky spoke again to refute the opinions of the U.S., British, and French representatives. Vyshinsky said that if, according to the laws of arithmetic, the total value remains unchanged regardless of how the numbers are rearranged, then people will not object to my opinion that the current issue is not the order in which things are discussed, but the issue of the Control Council. The issue of the Control Council is not a formal issue; it is inseparable from the essential issue of Germany. In refuting Bevin's view that the Allied control rights were limited to security matters, Vyshinsky said that just a month ago, Bevin, along with the U.S. and French representatives, signed three control agreements and an occupation statute agreement in Washington. In these two agreements, the tasks of control were described much more broadly than issues related to security. One only needs to read the provisions of the occupation statute to see that control over foreign trade, currency issuance, foreign relations, international agreements concluded by Germany itself or on behalf of Germany, German domestic affairs, etc., are all taken into consideration. The charter of the Allied control mechanism for Germany, drafted by the European Advisory Commission in London in May 1945, as well as the Potsdam Agreement, also clearly stipulated the scope of Allied control. Of course, there is also a difference, which is that the occupation statute is merely a poor imitation of a good document. In refuting Acheson's opposition to the Soviet delegation's position of defending the principle of unanimous agreement in the Control Council, Vyshinsky said that deciding issues according to the principle of unanimous agreement, rather than forcing one party's decisions on everyone through majority vote, is a common practice in international meetings held between equal and independent countries.

　　外长会议第四次会上
  　苏坚主德国统一
    恢复德国管制委会建立全德国务会议
  　美英法仍拒绝四国一致原则
    【新华社北平二十八日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：苏美英法四国外长于五月二十六日举行第四次会议，继续辩论德国统一问题和苏联关于这一问题所提的建议，由美国务卿艾奇逊担任主席。
    由于法外长舒曼的请求，苏外长维辛斯基在会上重新阐述了苏联政府关于恢复德国管制委员会及建立全德国务会议的两项建议。维辛斯基继称，舒曼以某种程度的不信任，看待苏联建议中关于经济机构的那一部分，舒曼问题：为什么苏联建议只提到德国经济机构，而不是任何其他机构呢？维辛斯基说，理由很简单，因为目前西德联占区没有其他适当的德国机构。苏联建议是以现实存在的东西为基础的。苏联政府认为，必须用手头现有的东西来缔造德国的统一，用现存的砖瓦来造房子。
    尽管在维辛斯基以后发言的艾奇逊也说苏联的建议是“清楚而确切”的，但是，西方国家的代表，仍然继续象过去那样对苏联的建议提出含混而不确定的反对，同时，又不提出他们自己的任何建设性的建议。
    艾奇逊的发言硬说，苏联的建议都与事情的本质无关，而且仅涉及“组织方面的问题，具有机构性质的问题”。艾奇逊重述他昨天的意见说，要解决重建四国管制委员会的问题，只有在有关德国的各种经济问题得到研究和解决之后。艾奇逊又认为，苏联的建议“归根到底就是重建须以一致协议为基础方能采取决定的盟国管制委员会”。这里，他明显地表明了他们不愿接受苏联代表团所提恢复盟国管制委员会活动的建议，恰恰就因为他们反对一致协议的原则。
    舒曼随即宣称，要了解维辛斯基的建议，仍然是“颇为困难的”。他对苏联建立全德国务会议的建议一事表示不满，他说，在他看来，这是不可能实现的。舒曼也象艾奇逊一样，并没有说清楚法国代表团所要的是什么。
    贝文的发言则较为确定。他说：“我们这里主要分歧的地方，就是目前以全德国务会议的形式提出来的建议，与西占区中现存的东西不同。这种不同是绝对清楚的。”贝文追随着艾奇逊说，他也认为在恢复四国管制之前，必须先解决若干经济问题。
    维辛斯基再次发言驳斥美英法代表的意见。维辛斯基说，如果按照算术的定律，不论数字的排列如可倒换，其总值不变；那末，人们将不反对我的意见，即目前的问题不是按什么次序讨论的问题，而是管制委员会的问题。管制委员会的问题不是形式问题，这是与德国问题的本质问题分不开的。维辛斯基在驳斥贝文把盟国管制的权利仅限于安全问题的意见时说，只是在一个月以前，贝文曾和美法代表一道，在华盛顿签订了三个管制协定和占领法规协定。在这两个协定里，管制的任务都是说得比有关安全的问题广泛得多。人们一读占领法规的条文，就可以看到，管制对外贸易、货币发行、对外关系、德国自己或代表德国缔结的国际协定、德国内政等等，都考虑在内。欧洲谘询委员会一九四五年五月在伦敦所拟的关于对德管制机构的章程以及波茨坦协定，也都清楚地规定了盟国管制的范围。当然，这里也有区别，这就是占领法规不过是好文件的恶劣翻版而已。在驳斥艾奇逊反对苏联代表团保卫管制委员会一致协议原则的立场时，维辛斯基说，按一致协议的原则决定问题，而不是用大多数表决的方法强使大家接受某一方的决定，这是国际上在平等自立国家举行会议时常用的方式。
