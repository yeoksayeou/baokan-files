The remaining armed forces of the Kuomintang are collapsing and in utter disarray. During their retreat, they committed all sorts of atrocities, including rape, arson, and looting, leaving many towns and shops along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Guiyang railway lines completely ransacked. However, as soon as they came into contact with the People's Liberation Army, they laid down their arms and surrendered. In the ranks of hundreds of captured enemy soldiers, there were often more than a dozen organized units, illustrating the chaotic situation. In the large-scale annihilation battle north of Guangde, the People's Liberation Army, with a single regiment and suffering only one minor injury, completely annihilated two entire enemy regiments. In the areas passed through by the People's Liberation Army, the local reactionary Kuomintang regimes also flocked in to report their surrender and request accommodation.

　　敌匪狼狈溃不成军放下武器请求收容
    而国民党残余武装力量则土崩瓦解，溃不成军。在溃逃途中，奸淫焚掠无恶不作，京沪和京贵路沿线许多城镇商店被洗劫一空。但他们与解放军一接触，就放下武器，向解放军投降。在俘虏敌军数百人的行列中，常常有十几个建制单位的、其混乱情况可见一斑。在广德以北地区的大歼灭战中，解放军以一个团兵力，轻伤一人的代价，即全歼敌军两个整团。在解放军经过的地区，国民党地方反动政权，也纷纷报到投诚，请求收容。
