The People's Daily previously published a Pravda editorial entitled "Implementing the Strictest System of Thrift." The Xinhua News Agency's editor's note pointed out: "Thrift is one of the important issues in our current great work of restoring and developing the national economy," and requested that it "arouse the attention of all Party comrades, government workers, economic workers, the working class, and the broad masses of the people." Yesterday, Comrade Bo Yibo also called on everyone to practice thrift at the welcoming meeting for North China worker representatives (see today's first page of this newspaper). Obviously, launching a thrift campaign has become the most urgent political task at present.

Production and thrift were slogans of historical significance for the military and civilians in our North China region. We relied on production and thrift to achieve self-sufficiency, ensuring military and civilian needs, and fought the war to defeat Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, finally liberating all of North China. During the war years, all the military and civilians learned to live frugally. We were able to overcome any war difficulties and serious disasters victoriously, turning scrap metal into weapons to kill the enemy. We also paid attention to "precise calculation" for every grain of rice, every needle and thread, truly achieving "everything for the front," ensuring victory. Now the situation has undergone fundamental changes. We have transitioned from a wartime environment to a peaceful environment, from rural areas to cities. This transition is the victorious result of the hard work, sacrifice, bloodshed, and arduous struggle of all our military and civilians during the eight-year War of Resistance and the three-year People's Liberation War. At this critical juncture of transition, we must continue to carry forward the past style of hard work to shoulder the great historical task of restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, carrying out comprehensive peaceful construction, and transforming our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country. This task can be said to be more complex, more arduous, and more long-term than in the past. The economic construction we painstakingly created through production and thrift is only, as Chairman Mao said, "the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles" compared to our future peaceful construction.

After liberating and taking over many cities, some government agencies and enterprises promptly paid attention to maintaining the past fine traditions, which is good. However, the phenomenon of not cherishing and arbitrarily wasting resources is still very serious. In addition to the existence of anarchic production, failure to calculate costs, waste of raw materials, damage to equipment, excessive non-production personnel, and loss-making phenomena in some public enterprises and institutions, many agencies, after entering the city, did not take advantage of the convenient conditions of the city to streamline and downsize their organizations, but instead became even larger. Some people have not improved their work but instead are haggling over enjoyment, fostering a style of extravagance, forgetting that our standard of living cannot exceed the existing standard of living of workers and peasants. Any of the above phenomena, if it occurs in any place, will inevitably affect work, damage national wealth, and add many difficulties to our reconstruction work. Therefore, in order to turn consumption cities into production cities and lead rural construction well, we must establish the strictest thrift system in all government agencies and enterprises, conduct thrift education, launch a thrift campaign, and fight against all phenomena of destruction and waste.

To fight for thrift, we must conduct strict inspections in a led and systematic manner, inspecting all waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, advocating calculation, calculating costs, consumption, and various expenses of government agencies, and exposing the erroneous phenomenon of thinking that something is "public property," or that there are more things now that we have won, and that we can waste and squander them at will. The "production and thrift campaign to reduce costs and improve quality" that many factories are currently carrying out should be universally promoted and popularized. In government agencies, we should combine the study of the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee to examine our thinking, promptly overcome certain unhealthy phenomena, and call on everyone to carry forward the traditional style of hard work for the sake of restoring and developing production.

Launching a thrift campaign is our enterprise management method and also the lifestyle characteristic of our revolutionaries. Thrift is not passive, but to better mobilize all possible manpower, material resources, and time to production and construction work. This is a long-term and regular task, and there must be organizational guarantees. The Party branches of various government agencies and enterprises can convene Party representative meetings, or they can convene worker representative meetings, factory management committees, Communist Youth League member meetings, and administrative department meetings. Everyone should seriously discuss this issue, relying on the political enthusiasm and consciousness of the working class and all cadres, review the past, stipulate future methods, and establish the strictest thrift system.

### 开展节约运动！

专栏：短论

　　开展节约运动！
    前日本报发表了一篇题为“实行最严格的节约制度”的真理报社论，新华社编者按语中指出：“节约是我们目前恢复和发展国民经济的伟大工作中的重要问题之一”，要求“引起全党同志、政府工作者、经济工作者、工人阶级和广大人民群众的注意”，昨天薄一波同志在欢迎华北职工代表会上也号召大家节约（见本报今日一版），显然，开展节约运动，在目前已成为一个最紧迫的政治任务。
    生产节约，对于我华北区军民来说，是一个有历史意义的战斗口号，我们曾靠着生产节约来达到自给自足，保证了军需民用，进行了打败日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮的战争，最后解放了全华北。在战争的年月里，全体军民都学会了过日子，任何战争困难和严重灾荒，我们都能胜利渡过来，并把破铜烂铁造成杀敌利器，一米一粟一针一线也都讲究“精确计算”，真正做到了“一切为了前线”，保证了胜利。现在情况已起了根本的变化。我们从战争的环境已经过渡到和平的环境，从农村转入了城市。这一转变是我全体军民在八年抗战三年人民解放战争中克勤克俭，牺牲流血，艰苦奋斗的胜利结果，在这一转变的关头，我们必须继续发扬以往艰苦奋斗的作风来担负起恢复与发展工农业生产，进行全面的和平建设，把我们的国家从农业国变为工业国的伟大历史任务，这一任务较之过去可以说是更加复杂，更加艰巨，更加长远。我们曾经生产节约辛勤缔造的经济建设比之于我们未来的和平建设，也只不过有如毛主席所说的：“只是万里长征走完了第一步”。
    在解放和接管许多城市以后，有些机关企业及时注意保持了过去的优良传统，这是好的，但是，那种不知爱惜和任意浪费的现象仍是很厉害的。除了有些公营企业机关存在着生产无政府状态，不计算成本，浪费原料，损毁器材，非生产人员过多，以及赔钱现象等而外，还有不少的机关在进城之后，不是利用城市便利条件，精干缩小机构，而是更加庞大了，也有的人不是更加提高工作，反而斤斤计较享受，滋长了一种奢侈的作风，忘掉了我们的生活水平不能超过工人农民现有生活水平。以上各种现象，任何一个地方发生了，必然会影响工作。使国家财富受到损害，给我们的重建工作增加不少的困难。因此，为了把消费的城市变成生产的城市，把农村建设领导好，就必须在一切机关企业中建立最严格的节约制度，进行节俭教育，开展节约运动，同一切破坏与浪费的现象作斗争。
    为节约而斗争，必须有领导地系统地进行严格的检查，检查一切有关的人力、物力、财力的浪费，提倡计算，计算成本、消耗，计算机关各种开支，揭发那种以为是“公家的”东西，或者说是现在胜利了东西多了，更可以随便浪费挥霍的错误现象。目前不少工厂正在进行的“降低成本，提高质量的生产节约运动”，应当普遍地发扬推广，在机关，应结合学习二中全会精神检查思想，及时克服某些不健康现象，号召大家为着恢复与发展生产发扬传统的艰苦作风。
    开展节约运动，是我们企业经营方法，也是我们革命者的生活特色，节约不是消极的，而是为了更好的动员一切可能利用的人力物力和时间到生产建设工作上来，这是一个长期的经常的工作，必须要有组织上的保证，各机关企业的支部可以召开党的代表会议，也可以召开职工代表会议，工厂管理委员会，青年团员大会，行政部门会议，大家都来认真讨论这一问题，依靠工人阶级及全体干部政治上的积极性，自觉性，检讨过去，规定今后办法，建立最严格的节约制度。
