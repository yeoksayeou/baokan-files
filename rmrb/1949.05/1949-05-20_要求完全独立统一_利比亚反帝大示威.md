　　Demanding Complete Independence and Unity
  　Libyan Anti-Imperialist Demonstration
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th] Reports from various sources: During the discussion and passage of the Bevin-Sforza plan by the UN Political and Security Committee, large-scale demonstrations against US and British imperialism erupted in Tripoli, the capital of the former Italian colony of Libya. The demonstrations began on May 11th and continued to expand on the 14th, 15th, and 16th. On the 16th, more than two thousand demonstrators, disregarding the suppression by British tanks and local police stations, shouted slogans such as "Demand complete independence and unity of all Libya," "Libya belongs to the Libyans," and "Oppose the Bevin-Sforza plan" in front of the consulates of the United States, Britain, and France. Under the instruction of the British authorities, local police have barbarously used firearms against unarmed masses in previous people's demonstrations. On the 14th alone, nine people were injured (AFP). On the 16th, the movement for complete independence of Libya spread to Cyrenaica. Angry demonstrators in the area retaliated against British police in front of the British military government, taking down and tearing up the British flag.

    【新华社北平十八日电】各方报道：在联大政治安全委员会讨论及通过贝文——史佛卓计划期间，前意属殖民地利比亚首都的黎波里爆发了反对美英帝国主义的增大示威。示威开始于五月十一日，在十四、十五、十六三日继续扩大。十六日，二千余示威者不顾英国坦克与地方警局弹压，在美英法三国领事馆门前高呼“要求总利比亚完全独立与统一”，“利比亚归利比亚人”，“反对贝文——史佛卓计划”等口号。在英国当局的指示下，当地警察在历次人民示威中，都曾野蛮地向徒手群众使用火器，仅十四日一日即有九人受伤（法新社）。十六日，争取利比亚完全独立的运动，扩及昔兰尼加。该地愤怒的示威群众在英国军政府门前对英国警察实行反击，取下并撕毁了英国国旗。
