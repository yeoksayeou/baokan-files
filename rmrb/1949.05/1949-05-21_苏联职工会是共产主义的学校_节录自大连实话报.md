　　Soviet Trade Unions are a School of Communism
  　Excerpt from Dalian Truth Daily

　　In October 1917, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet working people overthrew the regime of landlords and capitalists and founded a new type of state - the Soviet Socialist state. For the first time in human history, the people became the full masters of their own destiny. The working class had become the ruling class, and their most difficult task was to lead all working people onto the road of new economic construction, create new labor discipline and new labor organizations.

　　The Russian working class, tempered by three revolutionary struggles, entered the construction of socialist society with enthusiasm and a spirit ready to endure any sacrifice, but at that time it did not have the experience of economic construction and economic management. It had to start from scratch, learning while building, and learning in construction. The Bolshevik Party carried out tremendous educational work in order to develop and strengthen the qualities of national leaders in the working class, to demonstrate to all working people a model of creative socialist discipline, and a model for recognizing the tasks of socialist construction.

　　In this arduous work, the most reliable supporter of the Bolshevik Party was the trade union. "A primary and fundamental driving belt, a primary and fundamental transmission machine, with its help, the party gets in touch with the working class - this is the trade union" (Stalin).

　　When Lenin pointed out the most important characteristic of the Soviet trade union, he said that the Soviet trade union was an organization of the ruling class in power. But he emphasized: "But this is not a state organization, this is not a compulsory organization, this is an educational organization, a guiding organization, a training organization, it is a school, a school of management, a school of operation, a school of communism." Stalin pointed out that Soviet trade unions select outstanding people from among themselves to lead all management departments, realize the connection between the progressive and backward elements in the working class, and unite the working class with the vanguard of the working class - the Communist Party.

　　The enemy activities of the Trotskyites, and their attempts to destroy the trade union, were resolutely stopped by the Bolshevik Party. Their method of replacing the basic method of trade union activities - the method of persuasion - with command methods, was also eradicated by the party. The right-wing opportunists attempted to lure the trade union onto the road of the British labor movement, to lure the working class into obeying the consciousness and policies of the bourgeoisie. The party dealt a fatal blow to this kind of element. The traitors to the cause of the working class and the public enemies of the people were defeated.

　　"Contacting the masses, that is, contacting the vast majority of workers (and then contacting some laborers), this is the most important and fundamental condition for the success of any undertaking of the trade union." This is how Lenin instructed. The Soviet trade union often learns some methods from the Bolshevik Party, contacts the masses from all aspects, carefully listens to the voices of the masses, understands the demands of the masses, and not only educates the masses, but also learns from the masses.

　　All the undertakings of the trade union lie in educating the masses in the spirit of communism. The fact of participating in the trade union has become an important event in the lives of workers and staff. Joining the trade union not only has certain priorities, but the workers and staff who join the trade union also bear certain obligations. Members should abide by the resolutions of the organization, implement these resolutions, and obey trade union discipline.

　　At the initial stage of joining the trade union, the fundamental habits of organizational life are instilled in the laborers. Trade union members participate in all staff meetings of enterprises and workshops, attend production meetings, and gradually broaden their horizons. It attracts their attention to the life interests of all personnel in socialist enterprises, which is also the interest of the entire socialist society. The signing of collective contracts between the factory and the factory committee of the trade union (which is the representative of workers and staff) and the universal participation of workers and staff have extremely important educational significance. The discussion of draft contracts puts forward thousands of suggestions, which clearly proves the sense of responsibility of the Soviet working class for the fate of production, a feeling that they are the masters of the motherland.

　　苏联职工会是共产主义的学校
  　节录自大连实话报
    一九一七年十月，以布尔什维克党为首的苏联劳动人民，推翻了地主和资本家底政权，创立了新型的国家——苏维埃社会主义国家。在人类历史上人民头一次做了自己命运底全权主人。工人阶级已经成为当权阶级了，他们最困难的任务在于领导一切劳动群众走上新的经济建设的道路，创立新的劳动纪律和新的劳动组织。
    受过三次革命斗争锻炼的俄国工人阶级，进入了社会主义社会的建设，充满热忱并抱有准备去经受任何牺牲的精神，但在该时它还没有经济建设的经验和管理经济。它必须一切从头作起，一面建设一面学习，在建设中学习。布尔什维克党进行了巨大的教育工作，以便在工人阶级身上发展并加强全民领袖的品质，能对全体劳动人民表现出创造性的社会主义纪律模范，认清社会主义建设任务的模范。
    在这一繁巨工作中，布尔什维克党最可靠的拥护者是职工会。“一条首要的根本的推动机器的皮带，一个首要的根本的传达机器，在它底帮助之下，党同工人阶级取得联系——这就是职工会”（斯大林）。
    列宁在指出苏联职工会最重要的特点时，他说苏联职工会是当权的统治阶级底组织。但他强调指出：“但这不是国家组织，这不是强迫组织，这是教育组织，诱导的组织，训练的组织，这是一所学校，管理的学校，经营的学校，共产主义的学校”。斯大林指出，苏联职工会从本身中间挑选出领导一切管理工作部门的优秀人物，实现工人阶级中进步和落后两种成份的联系，把工人阶级与工人阶级底先锋队——共产党——团结到一块。
    托洛茨基分子底仇敌活动，破坏职工会的企图，被布尔什维克党坚决阻止住了，他们用命令方法代替职工会活动底基本方法——说服方法，也被党根绝了，右派机会主义分子企图将职工会，诱入英国职工运动的道路，诱入工人阶级服从资产阶级意识和政策的道路，党对这种分子作了致命的打击。工人阶级事业底叛徒，人民底公敌是被击败了。
    “联系群众，即联系绝大多数工人（然后联系一些劳动者），这就是职工会任何一项事业成功底最重要最根本的条件。”列宁就是这样指示的。苏维埃职工会经常向布尔什维克党学习一些办法，从各方面联系群众，细心倾听群众呼声，了解群众要求，不仅教育群众，还向群众学习。
    职工会全部的事业，都在于以共产主义的精神教育群众。参加职工会这一事实已经成了工人、职员生活中的重要事件。加入职工会不仅有一定的优先权，并且加入职工会的工人、职员还负有一定的义务。会员应当遵守本团体的决议，执行这些决议，服从职工会纪律。
    还在加入职工会的初期，便给劳动者灌输了组织生活的一些根本习惯。职工会会员参加所有一切企业、车间的工作人员会议，出席生产会议，慢慢扩大他们的眼界。引起他们注意社会主义企业全体人员的生活利益，同时也就是整个社会主义社会底利益。厂方与职工会工厂委员会（这是工人、职员的代表）之间签订集体合同，工人、职员普遍参加，这一点有其极重大的教育意义。合同草案的讨论提出成千成万的建议，清楚地证明，苏维埃工人阶级对于生产命运的责任感，一种自己是祖国的主人的感觉。（未完）
