    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: The first Congress of 140,000 coal mine workers in the entire Northeast, lasting five days, victoriously concluded on the 25th of last month.  A total of 287 worker representatives participated in the conference, coming from ten state-owned coal mines, including Fushun, Benxi, Hegang, Jixi, Saima, Xi'an, Fuxin, Jiaohe, Tonghua, and Beipiao, as well as provincial state-owned coal mines.  The representatives unanimously adopted the plan put forward by the Northeast Coal Mine Bureau to produce 10 million tons of coal this year and decided to mobilize all workers to carry out production competitions, achieving fixed staffing, fixed output, fixed quality, and fixed materials, to ensure the completion of the production tasks.  Regarding trade union work, the conference decided to implement the policy of "everyone running the trade union," first focusing on improving worker welfare and cultural education.  To enable more planned development of coal mine worker work in the future, the conference established the Northeast Coal Mine Workers' General Union and elected 57 executive committee members, including Yang Changchun, Chen Gengfu, Zhang Shihhan, Jin Zhifu, and Xu Wanwen.

    At the conference, the delegations exchanged experiences.  More than 20 representatives spoke in succession, including those from 13 units.  Chang Zhongyi, a representative from the Jixi Mining Area, introduced how the mine implemented the policy of relying on and educating workers, promoting more than 1,000 administrative and trade union cadres at all levels within a year.  Under their leadership, the average daily coal production per person in the entire mine increased from 0.3 tons to 0.56 tons, an increase of 88% compared to the period of enemy and puppet rule.  Xu Hongwen, a representative from Benxi, made a vivid speech on how to organize labor and reduce manpower waste.  He believed that to further increase production, labor must be adjusted.  According to a survey of the mine, out of 5,971 people in the entire mine, 5,044 were working, of which 1,822 were directly involved in production, while 3,222 were indirectly involved in production, a ratio of 1 to 1.8.  According to their calculations, if 500 people were added to direct production, based on an average daily output of 0.85 tons of coal per person, an additional 11,050 tons of coal could be produced in a month (calculated on 26 days).  At 500,000 Northeast currency per ton of coal, the state could produce an additional 5.5 billion yuan per month.  The conference decided to adjust the existing ratio of direct to indirect production personnel in each mine to 6:4 (the minimum should be 5:5).

    At the closing session, Wang Shoudao, Minister of Industry of the Northeast Administrative Committee, called on all representatives to unite all workers after returning, to complete and exceed the production plan, and to create Stakhanovite-style labor heroes of the Northeast.  Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, urged the representatives to implement the policy of "everyone running the trade union," oppose closed-doorism, and quickly expand membership to more than 90% of all employees, and to run worker cooperatives well, train cooperative cadres, and organize the families of workers to engage in sideline production to improve workers' lives; at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen security work and the leadership and education of medical personnel in the mining area.  Finally, Sun Ran, Director of the Northeast Coal Mine Bureau, on behalf of the Labor Movement Department of the Northeast Political Committee, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Coal Mine Bureau, and the Northeast Coal Mine Workers' General Union, awarded a total of 1 billion yuan in bonuses to twelve mines that completed and exceeded production and restoration plans last year.

    Furthermore, the Northeast Coal Mine General Bureau has decided to allocate 170 billion yuan to build worker dormitories and add hospital equipment.

    东北煤矿职工代表大会闭幕
    计划今年产煤千万吨
    工业部部长王首道号召全体职工创造斯大哈诺夫式东北劳动英雄
    【新华社沈阳二日电】全东北十四万煤矿职工的首次代表大会，历时五日，于上月二十五日胜利结束。参加大会的职工代表共二百八十七名，来自抚顺、本溪、鹤岗、鸡西、赛马、西安、阜新、蛟河、通化、北票等十个国营煤矿和各省省营煤矿。各代表一致通过了东北煤矿局所提今年生产一千万吨煤的计划，并决定以动员全体职工开展生产竞赛，做到定员、定量、定质、定材，来保证生产任务的完成。在工会工作上，大会决定贯彻大家办工会的方针，首先把职工福利和文化教育工作做好。为使今后煤矿职工工作更有计划地开展，大会产生了东北煤矿业职工总会，并选出杨长春、陈耕夫、张世韩、金直夫、徐完文等五十七人为执行委员。
    在大会上各代表团互相交流了经验，相继发言的代表有二十余人，包括十三个单位。鸡西矿区代表常忠义介绍该矿贯彻依靠工人、教育工人的方针，在一年内提拔了各级行政、工会干部一千多人。在他们的领导下，全矿人员从每日每人平均产煤零点三吨提高到零点五六吨，比敌伪统治时期提高了百分之八十八。本溪代表徐宏文对如何组织劳动力减少人力浪费作了生动的发言。他认为要把生产提高一步，必须调整劳动力。根据该矿调查，全矿五千九百七十一人，上工的为五千零四十四人，其中直接生产的有一千八百二十二人，而间接生产的却达三千二百二十二人，比例是一比一点八。根据他们的计算，如果增加五百人参加直接生产，按每人每日产零点八五吨煤计，一月（以二十六天算）即可多产煤一万一千零五十吨。以一吨煤五十万元（东北币）算，每月可多为国家生产五十五亿余元。会上决定将各矿现有直接与间接生产人员的比例调整为六比四（最低限度应为五比五）。
    在闭幕会上，东北行政委员会工业部部长王首道号召全体代表回去后要团结全体职工，完成并超过生产计划，创造东北的斯大哈诺夫式的劳动英雄。东北职工总会主席张维桢叮嘱代表们要贯彻大家办工会的方针，反对关门主义偏向，迅速把会员发展到占全体职工的百分之九十以上，并要办好职工合作社，培养合作社干部，组织工人家属进行副业生产，以改善职工生活；同时，要加强保安工作，对于矿区医务人员的领导教育。最后，东北煤矿局局长孙然代表东北政委会工运部、东北职工总会、东北煤矿局及东北煤矿职工总会以奖金十亿元分别授予去年完成一超过生产、修复计划的十二个矿山。
    又讯：东北煤矿总局决定拨款一千七百亿元，作为修建工人宿舍和添置医院院设备之用。
