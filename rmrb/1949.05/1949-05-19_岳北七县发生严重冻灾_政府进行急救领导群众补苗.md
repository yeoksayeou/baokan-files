[Taiyue Telegraph] Comrade Wang Pixu of the Agricultural Section of the Northern Yue Prefecture urgently telegraphed on the 14th of this month: Due to the sudden cold weather in Northern Yue on the 13th and 14th of this month, severe frost damage occurred in seven counties of Northern Yue, and most of the autumn seedlings were frozen to death. In Anze County and Lingnan Village south of Yongzhen, one-third of the planted cotton and hemp have been frozen to death, and all melons, beans, and rice paddies have been frozen to death. Ice edges a finger thick froze in the river of the county. In Qinshui County, most of the rice seedlings in the fourth and fifth districts have been frozen to death. On the 14th, the river water in the fourth district froze to two fingers thick, and the river water in the fifth district froze to three fingers thick. In Renjiazhuang in the district, most of the 2,400 mu of millet, corn, and hemp were frozen to death. It is said that two-thirds of the wheat in Qin County has been frozen to death, and the melons, fruits, beans, and reeds have almost completely been frozen to death. The river water in the county has also frozen to more than one finger thick. In Mazhuang, Tunliu County, the wheat with ears will have an 80% reduction in yield. All the beans and hemp in the village have been frozen to death, and nine-tenths of the cotton has been frozen to death. In Lingshi County, half of the cotton has also been frozen to death, and it is said that the wheat leaves have turned yellow. In Changzi County, most of the county had a frost of one finger thick. Furthermore, Anze and other counties suffered hailstorms. For example, in Wuma Village, out of a total of 3,015 mu of wheat land, 1,950 mu were completely destroyed. After the disaster occurred, the prefecture urgently telegraphed all counties, ordering them to immediately convene production meetings, urgently carry out seedling replanting and disaster relief, and send cadres to compile and report the affected area and extent of the disaster to the prefecture. First, find ways to solve the difficulty of lacking seeds for replanting. The District Party Committee Administrative Office is also studying solutions.

[Taihang Telegraph] At the beginning of this month, wheat seedlings in the second, fourth, and eighth districts of Ci County generally suffered frost damage. According to incomplete statistics, the frozen wheat fields reached 24,200 mu. Some of the frozen wheat seedlings cannot bear ears. The frozen wheat fields in the second district accounted for 44.8% of the total wheat fields, of which 467 mu had no harvest, and the remaining average yield was reduced by half. In the 26 villages affected by the disaster in the fourth district, more than 7,000 mu of wheat seedlings were damaged (relatively light). At present, in addition to instructing all districts to further investigate and understand the disaster situation and seize the opportunity to solve specific difficulties such as fertilizer and seeds for replanting, the county government has also sent the head of the cooperative section to Xiguanglu Village to understand the disaster situation: to discuss remedial measures with the masses, stabilize the masses' thinking, eliminate pessimistic emotions, and actively mobilize the masses to plow the wheat fields with no harvest or too little harvest and replant cotton and other autumn crops.

　　岳北七县发生严重冻灾
  　政府进行急救领导群众补苗
    【太岳电】据岳北专署农业科王丕绪同志本月十四日紧急电告：因本月十三、十四两日，岳北气候骤冷，岳北七县发生了严重的冻灾，秋苗大部冻死。安泽县和用镇以南的岭南村，种的棉花和大麻三分之一已冻死，瓜类、豆子、稻田全部冻死。该县河里冻了一指厚的冰凌。沁源县四、五区秧禾已大部冻死。四区十四日河水结冰二指，五区河水结冰三指。该区任家庄共二千四百亩谷子、玉茭、麻等，均大部冻死。沁县麦子据说已冻死三分之二，瓜、果、豆子苇子差不多完全冻死、该县河水也结了一指多厚的冰。屯留县马庄出穗麦子要减收八成。该村豆子、大麻全部冻死，棉花冻死十分之九。灵石县棉花也冻死二分之一，据说麦子叶已经冻黄。长子全县大部下霜一指厚。又安泽等县遭雹灾，如五马村共麦地三千零一十五亩，内有一千九百五十亩全部打坏。灾害发生后专署急电各县，令马上召开生产会议，紧急进行补苗救灾，并派干部将灾情面积、程度，统计报告专署。先设法解决补种中种籽缺乏困难。区党委行署亦正在研究解决办法。
    【太行电】本月初，磁县二、四、八三个区的麦苗，普遍遭受冻灾。据不完全统计，受冻麦田达二万四千二百亩。被冻麦苗有的已不能＠穗，二区受冻麦田占总麦田百分之四十四点八，其中没收成的有四百六十七亩，其余平均减少收成一半。四区受灾的二十六个村，冻坏麦苗达七千余亩（较轻）。现该县县府除一面指示各区进一步调查了解灾情、抓紧解决肥料、种籽等具体困难问题进行补种外，一面派合作科长亲到西光禄村了解灾情：与群众讨论补救办法，安定群众思想，扫除悲观情绪，积极发动群众将全无收成及收成太少的麦地，犁了补种棉花及其它秋田。
