　　I. Insect Pest Situation:

　　Due to the lack of snow last winter, the adult insects did not die overwinter, so insect pests have been occurring continuously in various places since the beginning of spring this year. Locust nymphs were discovered in Anyang in mid-February, and by the end of March, they had spread to 103 villages in eight districts of the entire county. Red spiders on wheat, flea beetles on rapeseed, and Eri Silkmoths on pear trees are quite serious and widespread. Dozens of red spiders gather at the top of wheat seedlings or on the surface of leaves to suck sap, causing the seedlings to wither and die. The average density of flea beetles is 28 per plant, with some having as many as 120. Several insects together surround a main stem, and after biting it off, the leaves fall to the ground, and dozens of insects gather to eat together. Eri Silkmoths in Yihua (Miyun) eat apricot trees, then pear trees, then poplar trees. Red spiders, in particular, have spread extremely rapidly due to the spring drought. As of now, insect pests have occurred in 55 counties and one city in six regions of North China, including Jizhong, Jinan, Taihang, Chahar, Taiyuan, and Taiyue. The most serious cases involve 359 villages and 279,446 mu. Red spiders have occurred in 36 counties and Shijiazhuang City, including Ningjin, Shulu, Luancheng, Jin County, Qingyuan, Anxin, Wuqiang, Lixian, Wen'an, Dacheng, Renqiu, Hejian, Cangxian, Jiaohe, Jianguo, Xianxian, Renhe, Huanghua, Anping, Suning, Gaoyang, Nanhe, Julu, Luyao, Jize, Guangping, Yongnian, Zhentang, Guangzong, Linqing, Chengci, Hengshui, Mancheng, Jiexiu, Xiaoyi, and Fenyang. Flea beetles have occurred in seven counties, including Renqiu, Ningjin, Shulu, Wu'an, Xingtai, Neiqiu, and Zhengding. Locust nymphs have occurred in five counties, including Anyang, Lin County, Tangyin, Cixian, and Qiuxian. Eri Silkmoths have occurred in three counties, including Zhuo Liang Wan, Yihua (Miyun), and Huairou. Aphids have occurred in Jiyuan, Fangshan, and Shijiazhuang City. In Jizhong, ten counties have experienced groundworms at the same time as red spiders and flea beetles. In some areas of Jinan, Taiyue, and Jizhong, wheat rust has occurred at the same time as insect pests. In addition, there are also insect pests such as leaf beetles, tent caterpillars, wheat sawflies, false wireworms, and cabbage white butterfly larvae. Therefore, if we do not mobilize the people to actively eliminate insect pests, it will greatly affect this year's great production campaign.

　　II. What measures should we take to prevent and control them?

　　(1) Last year, 5,350 villages in Taihang, Jinan, Jizhong, and Luyu experienced insect pests, leaving behind a large number of insect eggs. These areas have already raised their vigilance this year, but they should still pay attention to the continued occurrence of insect pests and fully prepare for prevention and control work. After insect pests occur, the masses often become paralyzed, waiting and relying on superstitious and backward ideas, such as saying, "Insect pests happen every year, it doesn't matter!" "Insect pests are the will of heaven, the more you fight them, the more there will be," etc. The leadership must seize the time and actively mobilize the masses to fight against insect pests. Anyang and Luancheng have done a better job in this regard. After the insect pest occurred in Anyang, a locust eradication headquarters was immediately organized, and all forces were quickly organized to eliminate the insect pest. Luancheng proposed to the masses, "Fighting insects is like fighting the Kuomintang; if you don't kill them, you can't keep your rice bowl." After a week of blitz, the insect pests in 32 villages were eliminated, and 18,610 mu of wheat were irrigated. (2) Various pests have certain habits and prevention methods. For example, red spiders are afraid of water, and watering is very effective. Eri Silkmoths are afraid of cold, they gather at night, and are easily captured in the morning. Spraying with pesticides must be done during the larval stage; once they roll up in the leaves, the medicinal power is ineffective. (3) Recently, we have distributed a batch of pesticides, approximately 100,000 jin, which can prevent and control various diseases and insect pests on 750,000 mu. It is hoped that all localities, in addition to adopting a large number of local methods, will make full use of this condition. Some local methods are very effective, some require the use of pesticides, and some require capture and beating. Due to various conditions, sometimes several methods must be used together. In short, the sooner the action is taken after insect pests occur, the better, and the faster the elimination, the better. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to pay close attention to establishing a disaster reporting system. It is hoped that the above methods will be adopted. All localities have achieved many results and gained a lot of experience in the struggle against insect pests. The most important thing is that the people must be organized to carry out arduous struggles. Only by combining scientific and technical methods with the people's insect eradication movement can insect pests be eradicated from the root.

　　防治华北各地虫灾
    华北人民政府农业部
　　一、虫害情况：
    由于去冬雪少，成虫过冬未死，所以今年虫害自入春以来即在各地不断发生。安阳蝗蝻二月中旬发现，至三月底已遍及全县八个区一百零三个村。小麦发生红蜘蛛，油菜发生猿叶虫，梨树发生猩毛虫，是相当严重相当普遍的。红蜘蛛是几十个虫子聚于麦苗顶端或叶面吸取汁液，使麦苗枯干而死。猿叶虫每株平均密度二十八个有多至一百二十个的，几个虫子共同围一主茎，咬断后叶子落地，几十个虫子聚来共食。乙化（密云）之猩毛虫吃了杏树吃梨树，吃了梨树吃杨树，特别是红蜘蛛，由于春旱关系，蔓延极快。截至目前为止，华北发生虫灾者已有冀中、冀南、太行、察哈尔、太原、太岳等六个地区五十五县和一个市，最严重者有三百五十九村二十七万九千四百四十六亩，其中发生红蜘蛛者有宁晋、束鹿、栾城、晋县、清苑、安新、武强、蠡县、文安、大城、任邱、河间、沧县、交河、建国、献县、任河、黄骅、安平、肃宁、高阳、南和、巨鹿、陆尧、鸡泽、广平、永年、振堂、广宗、临清、成磁、衡水、满城、介休、孝义、汾阳等三十六县及石庄市，发生猿叶虫者有任邱、宁晋、束鹿、武安、邢台、内邱、正定等七县。发生蝗蝻者有安阳、林县、汤阴、磁县、邱县等五县。发生猩毛虫者有涿良宛、乙化（密云）、怀柔等三县。发生蚜虫者有济源、房山及石庄市，冀中于发生红蜘蛛、猿叶虫同时，有十个县发生了地蚕。冀南、太岳、冀中有些地方于发生虫害同时发生了小麦锈病。此外尚有步曲、天幕占斯、麦叶蜂、伪步行虫、叶白蝶幼虫等虫害，因此，如不动员人民积极起来扑灭虫害，则势将给今年大生产运动以很大影响。
    二、我们采取什么办法防治？
    （一）去年太行、冀南、冀中、冀鲁豫等地，有五千三百五十村发生虫灾，遗留下大量虫卵。今年这些地区已经引起警惕，但仍应注视虫灾继续发生，充分准备防除工作。虫灾发生后，群众往往发生麻痹等待及迷信落后思想，如说“出虫的事那年都有，不要紧！”“出虫是天意，愈打愈多”等，领导上必须抓紧时间，积极动员群众向虫灾作斗争。这一点安阳、栾城较好，安阳虫灾发生后，立即组织了剿蝗指挥部，迅速组织一切力量消灭虫灾。栾城在发动群众中提出“打虫和打国民党一样，不打死它保不住饭碗子”。经过一周突击，消灭了三十二村的虫灾。而且浇了一万八千六百一十亩麦子。（二）各种害虫均有一定习性及防除办法，譬如红蜘蛛怕水，浇水非常有效。猩毛虫怕冷，晚上集中，早晨容易捕杀，用药剂喷杀，非在幼虫时期不可，等卷到叶里药力就无效了。（三）最近我们已分配了一批农药，约计十万斤可以防治各种病虫害七十五万亩，希望各地除大量采用土办法外；充分利用这一条件，有的用土法很有效，有的需用药剂，有的则非捕打不可，由于各种条件限制，有时须要几种办法，一齐使用。总之虫害发生后，下手愈早愈好，消灭愈快愈好，为了达到这一目的须要十分注意建立灾情报告制度。以上这些办法，望注意采用，各地在与虫灾作斗争中取得了不少成绩，也有了很多经验，其中最重要的一条就是必须组织人民进行艰忍的斗争。只有把科学的技术方法，同人民的除虫运动结合起来，才会从根本上灭绝了虫害。
