    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 11th: The people of the Central Plains Liberated Area are fully supporting the southward marching army. On a map at the Central Plains Front Support Headquarters, support-the-front organizations of governments at all levels are scattered all over along the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. All governments above the county level in the entire liberated area have established front support headquarters, and governments below the district level have established command posts. Around the support-the-front organizations of governments at all levels, every ten to twenty miles, there are attached supply stations for various oil, salt, grain, firewood, and straw. There are approximately two thousand such supply stations in the entire area. The trade companies in each sub-region control a considerable amount of non-staple foods such as oil, salt, soybeans, and sesame, which are sold to the supply stations at low prices. At the same time, in the vicinity of the troop garrisons, residents are called upon and organized to grow vegetables and raise bean sprouts in large quantities, which are purchased by the troops in an organized manner. Due to the planned implementation of this work, not only has the main non-staple food supply of the troops been resolved, but also, during this spring famine period, some of the people's livelihood difficulties have been resolved. More importantly, fluctuations in market prices have been reduced. When the first batch of the army passed through, the Central Plains region maintained the price index of late January, which saved the financial expenditure of the government and the people, and laid a good foundation for continuing to support the front in the future. The achievements in road construction are also very great. Now, 22 highways of various sizes have been repaired in the entire Central Plains region, totaling 2,696 kilometers, and 683 new bridges have been built. One county completed a highway 75 li long and 8 meters wide in six days. More than 20,000 trees have been planted along the road, and more than 324,000 air-raid shelters have been built to facilitate air defense for the troops during daytime marches. When the troops were still on the north bank of the Yellow River, urban and rural residents had already vacated their houses. People from all over also organized visiting groups to inspect the preparations, and everyone proposed to ensure that the army would eat comfortably and sleep happily after arriving. In some areas, every designated house was posted with a colorful slogan that read, "There are × rooms in this house, welcome the army to stay here." At night, the pre-determined garrison villages lit up lanterns, and wooden signs indicating directions were inserted at intersections. When the troops arrived there, men and women on both sides of the road greeted them with buckets of boiling water.

    中原人民热爱南下大军
    支前组织星罗棋布
    油盐柴草供应站达二千个
    【新华社中原十一日电】中原解放区的人民全力支援南下大军。在中原支援前线司令部的一张地图上，沿陇海、平汉两条铁路，各级政府的支前组织星罗棋布。全解放区县以上的政府都成立了支前司令部，区以下的政府成立有指挥部，在各级政府支前组织的十里到二十里的周围，附设着各种油盐，粮食、柴草的供应站。全区共有约二千个这样的供应站。每一个分区的贸易公司均掌握着相当数量的油盐、黄豆、芝麻等副食品，廉价售给供应站；同时在部队驻地附近，号召和组织居民大量种菜，养豆芽，有组织地买给部队。由于有计划地进行了这一工作，不但解决了部队主要副食供给同时，在此春荒时期，也解决了人民部分生活困难。更重要的是减少了市场物价的波动。当大军首批过境时，中原区物价保持了一月下旬的物价指数，这就节省了政府和人民的财政开支，为今后继续支援前线打下了良好基础，修筑公路的成绩也是很巨大的，现在中原全区已修复大小公路二十二条，共二千六百九十六公里，新修桥梁六百八十三座。有一个县六天完成一条七十五华里长八公尺宽的公路。沿路种了两万多棵树，并修有三十二万四千余个防空洞，使部队在白天行军时便于防空。部队还在黄河北岸时，城乡居民老早就腾好了房子。各地人民并自己组织了参观团，互相检查准备的情形，大家提出要保证大军到达后，吃得舒服，睡得愉快。有的地区，每一间号好的房子都张贴了“内有房子×间，观迎大军住此”的彩色标语。夜间，预先规定的驻军庄子，就点起了一盏盏灯，在十字路口，插着标明方向的木牌。部队到达那里，那里的大路两旁，男男女女都提着开水桶迎接着。
