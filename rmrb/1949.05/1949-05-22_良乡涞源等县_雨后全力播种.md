　　Liangxiang, Laiyuan and other counties
  　All-out sowing after the rain
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the rain on May 11, Liangxiang Second District and Yishui Special District of Chahar and other places immediately concentrated all their efforts on a crash sowing. After the rain in the Second District of Liangxiang, without waiting for instructions from the county party committee, the district production committee immediately issued an emergency notice to put aside all work unrelated to production and devote all efforts to farmland sowing. On the 12th, men and women, old and young in each village took action, dividing up the tasks of carrying water, sowing seeds, cultivating land, and spreading manure according to their physical strength and production skills. Elementary school students and old ladies also participated in the sowing. Wei Fu, a liberated farmer from Nanliyuan, pulled the seed drill himself, his wife prepared the seeds, and his twelve-year-old child pulled the roller, planting four mu of peanuts in half a day. Households without livestock organized people to pull rollers or exchange labor for cultivation. In a few days, the entire district sowed more than 20,000 mu of various crops, including 1,356 mu of cotton, exceeding more than half of the county's task. 2,100 mu of peanuts have also been planted. After the rain stopped, cadres and students in Langfang Town immediately went out to help the masses plant cotton. In less than two hours, the six people who went to Caidouzhuang planted 5,750 cotton nests (about 2.6 mu), and also dug more than 4,000 soil pits. In Fangshan Third District, nine villages cultivated more than 2,000 mu of land in a few days. Laiyuan, Tangxian, Dingxing, and Yixian in Yishui Special District, which experienced rainfall, are also organizing the masses to rush to plant cotton and autumn crops.

　　良乡涞源等县
  　雨后全力播种
    【本报讯】五月十一日落雨后，良乡二区及察哈尔易水专区等地立即集中全力突击播种。良乡二区在落雨后，未等县委指示，区生产委员会立即发下紧急通知，抛开一切不关生产的工作，将全力投入耕地播种。十二日各村男女老少全都行动起来，根据体力强弱与生产技能，分头挑水、下籽、耕地、撒粪等。小学生老太太也都参加播种。南梨园翻身农民尉富，自己拉耧耠沟儿，老婆料籽，十二岁的孩子拉墩子，半天种花生四亩。没牲口户组织人拉墩子或换工耕地。数日内全区共播种各种作物二万余亩，其中棉花一三五六亩，超过县里给的任务一半以上。花生也已种上二一零零亩。廊坊镇的机关干部和学生，雨停后立刻出动帮助群众种棉花，不到两小时，到蔡豆庄的六个人，就点种棉花五千七百五十窝（约二亩六分），还挖土坑四千余个。房山三区九个村数日内耕地二千余亩。易水专区涞源、唐县、定兴、易县落雨地区也正组织群众突击种棉和大秋作物。
