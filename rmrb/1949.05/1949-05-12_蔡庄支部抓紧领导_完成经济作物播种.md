    Cai Village Branch Intensifies Leadership
    Complete Sowing of Economic Crops
    [Chahar News] The Cai Village Branch, Third District of Fangshan, has intensified its leadership in spring plowing. As of May 6, the entire village had hoed wheat twice and completed the sowing of all economic crops. As the planting plan neared completion, the branch called on everyone to mobilize for a one-day blitz to hoe wheat and rush planting for eighteen families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents who lacked labor. The masses discussed enthusiastically, "Nanjing and Taiyuan have been taken, it's not easy for those at the front!" Fifty-nine people voluntarily participated, divided into four large groups, with Party members and cadres assigned to each group. In the morning, the group was led by Branch Secretary Wang Zhende, and in the afternoon by Branch Committee Member Cai Jingxiu. In one day, they hoed 81.5 mu of wheat, planted 3.8 mu of rice, and dibbled corn along the edges of cotton and peanut fields for eighteen households of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents lacking labor. Due to the active leadership of Party members and timely inspections by the branch, the village has already completed its planned 70 mu of peanuts and is continuing to plant, exceeding the planned number by 120 mu. Most of the cotton has been completed, with only about ten mu remaining to be sown. It is estimated that it will be completed in another day or two. The entire village has hoed wheat twice. According to Branch Secretary Wang Zhende, the entire village is confident of winning the red flag as a model production area in the district.

    [Chahar News] Due to the drought, many village cadres and masses in Zhengjia Village, First District of Huolu County, lost confidence in planting cotton, saying things like, "Planting cotton is a good thing, but there's nothing we can do without rain." In response to this mindset, the work team first convened a meeting of branch members to promote the benefits of planting cotton by calculating the accounts. They also calculated that each load of water could be used to plant 20 seedlings, and 120 loads of water would be needed per mu, requiring three workdays to plant one mu. Finally, eight Party members made cotton planting plans. After the branch meeting, Party members prepared the land, spread fertilizer, and bought seeds in advance, and used their own plans to influence and motivate the masses. The masses' confidence in planting cotton was boosted, and they formulated plans one after another, and are now carrying water to dibble and plant cotton.

    【察哈尔讯】天旱不雨，获鹿县一区郑家庄村不少村干部和群众失掉了种棉花的信心。如说：“种棉花是个好事，天不下雨没办法”。根据这种思想情况，工作组首先召开了支部党员会议，用算帐方法宣传种棉好处。又计算每担水能点种二十棵，一亩地用一百二十担水，用三个工就可以种一亩。最后有八个党员作了种棉计划，支部会议后，党员提前整地、撒粪、买籽种，并以自己作的计划影响带动群众。群众种棉信心提高，并纷纷制定了计划，现正挑水点种棉花。
