    Correspondence with Comrades in Various Localities:

    Combating drought and preventing disasters, making a concentrated effort in sowing, and planting cotton are the most urgent tasks in the countryside right now. We hope everyone will seize the time to organize reports on this. Regarding the difficulties encountered in the work, how to overcome them, how to organize labor to dig wells, carry water, and plant, and the specific degree of completion, as well as the prevention and control of various insect plagues and epidemics, we hope to systematically introduce the work experience and methods of a county or a region, in order to promote work, overcome natural disasters, and complete sowing.
