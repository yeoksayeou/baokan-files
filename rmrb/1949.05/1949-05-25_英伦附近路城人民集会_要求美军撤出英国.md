　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 23rd: TASS, London: Representatives of over ten thousand people in Ruislip, northwest of London, held a rally on the 19th to protest the presence of American air force personnel in the town. The rally was convened by the Ruislip branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. Speakers at the rally demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Britain, pointing out that these troops occupied the best houses in the town. One representative said: The main buildings occupied by the American troops could at least accommodate two hospitals, small factories, and assembly halls--things the local people have been wanting for years. The meeting decided to establish a permanent committee to carry out a campaign against the presence of American soldiers in the town.

    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：代表伦敦西北路斯里普城万余人民的代表们，于十九日举行集会，抗议美国空军人员驻在该城。集会是由机器工会联合会路斯里普分会召集的。代表们在该会上发言，要求美军撤出英国，并指出这些军队占据了该城最好的房屋。一个代表说：美军所占领的主要建筑至少足以容下两所医院、小工厂和集会处--这都是当地人民要了多年都要不到的东西。会议决定设立常设委员会来进行反对美国军人驻在该城的运动。
