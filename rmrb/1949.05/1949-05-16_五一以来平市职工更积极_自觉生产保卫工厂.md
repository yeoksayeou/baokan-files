Since May Day, Beijing Workers Are More Active:
　　Consciously Produce and Defend Factories

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the first "May Day" after liberation, the city's public and private enterprise workers have welcomed it with unparalleled production enthusiasm and excellent production achievements. Now that half a month has passed since "May Day," most factories and the vast number of workers are determined to consolidate the achievements of "May Day," further develop production, and build a new Beiping. Most public enterprises have successively made annual production plans and have already begun to act according to the plans. Some private factories have also made their own production plans. Although special agents had seriously damaged the tram company, the workers were not discouraged in the slightest. On the contrary, they were more actively involved in production and were confident in completing the company's plan. The Yanjing Paper Mill has designated May as a competition month. The factory's employees have proposed a task of producing 220 reams of paper per day. Soon after production, the daily output has exceeded this number, and the quality has also improved. The glass factory, which has been shut down for a year, officially ignited the furnace under the leadership of the Enterprise Bureau on the 12th of this month, and one hundred kinds of scientific instruments will soon be introduced. In the first half-year repair project stipulated by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the plan for March and April has been successfully completed. Now the main repair project, the No. 3 steam engine, has been completed, and the No. 4 steam engine will also be completed soon. In terms of private factories, such as the Cixing Iron Factory, the number of workers has recently increased from eight to nearly thirty, undertaking a large number of waterwheels, and accepting various repair orders. The workers are energetic in production, and the attitude of the capitalists has also improved. Not only do the enthusiastic production facts above fully illustrate the establishment of a new labor attitude among employees, but also the fact that employees care for their factories in all aspects also illustrates the correct relationship between workers and factories, as well as between labor and capital. In the past half month, in order to learn from the lessons of the tram company, public factories have successively established factory defense committees and organized worker pickets to protect their factories with their own strength. The pickets of the Jibei Power Company, Yanjing Paper Mill, Beiping Clothing Factory, and the First Mechanical Institute take turns guarding and patrolling day and night, demonstrating the high level of enthusiasm of the working class.

　　五一以来平市职工更积极
  　自觉生产保卫工厂
    【本报讯】本市各公私营企业全体职工，曾以无比的生产热情，优良的生产成绩，迎接了解放后的第一个“五一”节。现在“五一”已经过去了半个月，多数厂方与广大职工决心巩固“五一”成果，进一步发展生产，建设新北平。现大部公营企业已陆续地做出了一年的生产计划，并已按照计划行动起来。有些私营工厂也做出了自己的生产计划。特务分子虽曾对电车公司进行了严重的破坏，但工人们丝毫没有灰心，相反的，更积极的投入生产，对完成该公司计划均有信心。燕京造纸厂订五月为竞赛月，该厂职工提出每日造纸二百二十令的任务，生产不久，每日产量已超过了此数，质量也有提高。停工一年之久的玻璃厂，在企业局的领导下，于本月十二日正式点火温炉，不久将有百种科学仪器问世。石景山炼钢厂规定的第一个半年修复工程中，三、四月份已胜利完成计划，现在大修主要工程三号汽机已完成，四号汽机不久亦可完成。在私营工厂方面，如慈型铁工厂最近已由八个工人增到近三十个工人，承造大批水车，接受各种修理订制货物，职工生产带劲，资方情绪亦有提高。不但从以上的热烈生产事实中充分说明了职工新劳动态度的树立。同时，职工从各方面来爱护自己的工厂，也说明了工人与厂方的，以及劳资之间的正确关系。半月以来，各公营工厂为了接受电车公司的教训，先后均建立了工厂保卫委员会，组织起工人纠察队，以自己的力量保护自己的工厂。冀北电力公司、燕京造纸厂、北平被服厂、第一机械所的纠察队，日夜轮班看守巡逻，发挥了工人阶级高度积极性。
