    Western Hebei Establishes Windbreak Forest Belt
    Planting Over Two Million Trees
    Reclaiming 70,000 Mu of Sandy Wasteland
    [Jizhong News] Along the Pinghan Railway in western Hebei, sandy wasteland is widespread. Wind and sand encroach upon cultivated land, fill in wells, and transform fertile fields into deserts, posing a great threat to agricultural production. This spring, farmers in the sandy areas of six counties—Xinle, Wuji, Gaocheng, Xingtang, Quyang, and Zhengding—under the leadership of the North China Western Hebei Sandy Area Afforestation Bureau and local governments, launched a large-scale sandy area afforestation campaign to plant windbreak and sand-fixation forest belts, as well as poplar and willow mother tree forests along riverbanks, to block wind and sand and protect cultivated land and crops. By Qingming Festival, more than 2,451,000 trees had been planted, exceeding the original planned total for all three seasons by 27 percent. Among these, organized windbreak, sand-fixation, and flood-prevention forest belts amounted to more than 1,087,000 trees, capable of protecting cultivated land and eliminating more than 70,000 mu of sandy wasteland.
    In order to comprehensively promote sandy area afforestation in the six counties, the North China Ministry of Agriculture convened the Western Hebei Sandy Area Afforestation Conference at the end of February. The conference studied sandy area afforestation techniques and methods for organizing the masses for afforestation, and formulated a three-season afforestation plan for the whole year. The Ministry of Agriculture established the Western Hebei Sandy Area Afforestation Bureau to work with local governments to lead farmers in afforestation. Each county, according to the plan, arranged for afforestation and forest protection work. In addition, with the land reform completed and land rights determined, farmers' enthusiasm for production was very high, and the number of trees planted in each county greatly exceeded previous years. Thus, Fu Jiwen from Gunjun Village planted more than 1,000 trees himself, driving the entire village to plant more than 40,000 poplar and willow trees. According to statistics from 75 villages near the sandy areas of Wuji County, more than 111,000 trees were planted.
    In key sandy area afforestation zones, forestry cadres were assigned to deeply understand the situation and organize the masses to jointly engage in afforestation. For example, in Huangjia Village and Hejia Village in Xinle, several active individuals were identified from households affected by wind and sand. They connected with their neighbors, freely combined, and jointly invested labor and saplings to build a windbreak forest belt to protect cultivated land. They drew up a document stipulating that after the trees grew, a portion would be harvested and dividends distributed according to shares. They also organized forest protection and afforestation teams. The two villages organized a total of 14 teams, including 89 households, to build 14 windbreak forests, planting a total of more than 3,700 trees. In Wuji County, 12 villages organized a total of 26 cooperative afforestation teams, with 1,090 people planting more than 22,000 trees.
    Many villages along the Shahe River engaged in large-scale collective afforestation. Before the spring equinox, Xinle County mobilized 7,170 labor days from men and women in 41 villages, planting more than 276,000 trees.
    In order to cultivate a large number of tree seedlings in preparation for sandy area afforestation next year, each county is now focusing on nursery sowing. In addition to county-run nurseries, assistance is being provided to the masses to plant tree seedlings. The Afforestation Bureau has loaned out more than 1,300 jin of tree seeds such as Lespedeza bicolor, Amorpha fruticosa, Fraxinus chinensis, and Pyrus betulifolia, and more than 7,000 jin of grain for nursery loans. It has also dispatched technical personnel to assist each county in establishing nurseries, striving to complete 135 mu within one month. (Huang Shu)

    冀西建立防风沙林带
    植树二百余万棵
    可灭沙荒七万亩
    【冀中讯】冀西平汉沿线，沙荒遍布，风沙侵犯耕地，填毁水井，化良田为沙漠，给农业生产以极大威胁。今春新乐、无极、藁城、行唐、曲阳、正定等六县沙荒区之农民，在华北冀西沙荒造林局与当地政府领导下，开展大规模之沙荒造林运动，植造防风防沙林带，及河滩杨柳母树林，借以阻挡风沙，保护耕地田苗。至清明节已植树二百四十五万一千余株，一季超出原定全年三季计划的百分之二十七。其中有组织的防风防沙防洪林带，即达一百零八万七千余株。可保护耕地及消灭沙荒七万余亩。
    为了全面推动六县的沙荒造林，华北农业部二月底即召开冀西沙荒造林会议，研究沙荒造林技术与组织群众造林的方式，制订全年三季造林计划，由农业部设立冀西沙荒造林局，会同当地政府，领导农民造林。各县均根据计划，布置了造林护林工作，加之土改结束、地权确定，农民生产情绪很高，各县植树数字，都大大的超过往年。故郡村傅计文自己栽树一千余株。带动全村造杨柳树四万余株。据无极县沙荒附近七十五村的统计，栽树即达十一万一千余株。
    在各沙荒造林重点区，配备了林业干部，深入了解情况，组织群众合伙造林。如新乐黄家庄、何家庄等村，是从犯风地户中，找出几个积极分子，由他们串通地邻，自由结合，平均出人力、树秧，共同造一道防风林，保护耕地，立了文书，订明树长大后采伐一部分，按股分红。并组织护林造林小组，两村共组织了十四个组，包括八十九户，造防风林十四座，共计栽树三千七百余株。无极县有十二个村共组织了二十六个合作造林小组，一千零九十人共植树二万二千余株。
    沿沙河不少村大集体造林，新乐县在春分以前，即有四十一个村子发动男女劳动力七千一百七十余工，造林二十七万六千余株。
    为了大量养树苗，准备下年沙荒造林，各县现正突击苗圃播种，除县营苗圃外，并扶助群众下树秧。造林局已贷出胡枝子、紫穗槐、白蜡树、杜梨等树籽一千三百余斤，苗圃贷粮七千余斤，并派出技术人员分头协助各县建立苗圃。争取在一月内完成一百三十五亩。        （黄舒）
