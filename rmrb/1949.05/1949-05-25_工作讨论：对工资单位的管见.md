　　Work Discussion: My Humble Opinion on Wage Units
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhu Qiming
    We believe that Mr. Zhu Qiming's systematic opinions on the issue of wage calculation units are valuable for reference. We are publishing them specifically for relevant parties to study and to encourage discussion, with the aim of reaching a final and correct conclusion. Comrade Yu Renlin has already presented opposing views, which are also published together.

　　In any country undergoing currency fluctuations, the problem of the contradiction between nominal wages and real wages becomes more acute. However, except in socialist and New Democratic countries, the working class in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries always suffers from severe exploitation in this regard, exceeding the general rate of capitalist exploitation: their real wages are permanently reduced due to currency devaluation. The Kuomintang reactionaries, during eight years of passive resistance against Japan and three years of anti-people civil war, issued three astronomical amounts of currency – legal tender, customs gold units, and gold yuan – subjecting people of all classes in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to unprecedented extortion, especially workers and other laborers who rely on fixed salaries. Although the heroic anti-hunger struggles of the broad masses of people forced them to adopt certain “adjustments” periodically or irregularly, all these measures, compared with the speed of inflation, only formed an ironic ratio.

　　In the liberated areas, this situation fundamentally changed: wages were calculated and paid in kind, ensuring that real wages were maintained at a certain level. However, it is clear that if the market in the liberated areas were 100% stable, we would not need to discuss wage calculation units. The reality is that, due to the historical conditions of production and revolutionary war, we can only achieve a general steady rise in prices. To maintain the purchasing power of wages, we must find a calculation unit in kind that expresses the amount of laborers' living materials obtained in an unchanged number.

　　There are roughly two types of units used to calculate wages in the national liberated areas: one includes only one kind of material (such as millet or corn); the other includes several kinds of materials (such as the flour/fen calculation method). The calculation method of the cost of living index, which was used in Europe in the early 19th century and later adopted by some countries during the two world wars, was also adopted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The types of goods in this cost of living index are more numerous than flour/fen. Its principle is to encompass all the living materials of salary earners. This can be regarded as the third type, but its basic nature is similar to the second type.

　　The more types of goods there are, the more closely they match the types of living materials of wage earners and the proportion of various consumption amounts, the smaller the change in real wages. This is the advantage of calculation based on the cost of living index. However, its disadvantages are: first, separate statistics must be compiled in different regions, and a general, national cost of living index must also be obtained, which creates a certain degree of technical difficulty and complexity. Second, due to the inconsistent rise in raw material expenses and miscellaneous expenses in various industries compared to wages, industrial costs cannot be calculated. These difficulties have never been completely overcome even in countries with higher technical conditions. Therefore, after the First World War, some European countries also adopted a wage system based on one or two food grains as a calculation unit, which is quite similar in nature to our millet wages. In those capitalist countries that adopted the cost of living index calculation method, workers always suffered losses due to the time difference between the index publication date, the wage payment date, and the wage usage date. The creation of this loss, in addition to the inevitable technical reasons, is basically due to the fact that in capitalist countries, whether the determination of wages is by "agreement" between labor and capital or by government "arbitration," workers can never have the deciding power, and those regimes and capitalists always try their best to make workers suffer more losses. If the method of paying wages based on the cost of living index is adopted in the liberated areas, the losses suffered by workers can be avoided. However, it is very difficult to obtain an unchanging figure with a certain monetary nature in cost calculation.

　　A single material calculation unit is very simple in both wage payment and cost calculation, and wages and other raw materials and miscellaneous expenses can also be obtained from this common material to obtain a unified calculation unit. However, this method also has its shortcomings, namely, it cannot guarantee the unchanging purchasing power of wage earners for other living materials. But this shortcoming only occurs in two situations: first, when the price fluctuations of this material are not proportional to those of other living materials; second, when some of the other living materials suddenly deviate from normal rules and fluctuate. As long as these two situations can be avoided, a single material wage calculation unit can certainly function as a price index. Today, the above two situations can be avoided, and the guarantee is: the trade policy in the New Democratic economic policy is to control market prices through state capital and state-owned trading companies. If we review the price trends of several major living materials (such as various food grains, various non-staple foods, cloth, fuel, etc.) since the liberation of Beiping, we will obtain a slowly rising curve diagram with not too large fluctuations and mutual intersections. In the period when various curves are more widely distributed, the one in the middle is precisely the millet that we use as a wage calculation unit in Beiping. This shows that the People's Government's leadership over the market has basically prevented speculation by unscrupulous merchants and maintained the proportional changes in the prices of major living materials.

　　Of course, the calculation method of the cost of living index can maintain the mathematical constants of various living materials. In any case, this is something that millet wages cannot do; but when weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the two here, we must also pay attention to the following two issues: first, this mathematical quantification is only mathematical. That is to say, it is only on paper: because the price of the cost of living index is the average price in the calculation date, and there will always be differences between the price when wage earners actually purchase living materials, and it will never be possible to change completely in a mathematical proportion. Therefore, this quantification on paper is not realistic enough. Second, the types and quantities of living materials in the price index are also not balanced with the actual purchase amount of wage earners in each period. For example, there are not many people who buy cloth every month or every half month. A worker's wage has half a foot of cloth every half month on the calculation sheet of his cost of living index, but he will never divide the cloth for a piece of clothing into seven or eight purchases. From the above two points, it can be seen that under the conditions that the prices of various living materials generally change in proportion, workers will not feel any difference in their actual lives between millet wages and cost of living index wages.

　　The calculation method of fen and flour was a practical method before the liberation of the cities. But in the current situation, since the shortcomings of a single material calculation can be prevented through correct leadership of the market, a more complicated method is not necessarily necessary.

　　There is a possibility that exists: in the future, as industrial production gradually recovers and develops, the price of industrial products will relatively decrease, and the price of agricultural products will relatively increase. On the one hand, this trend means an increase in farmers' income, and on the other hand, under the condition of using a major agricultural product as a calculation unit, the living standards of employees will also be improved. This trend is reasonable and ideal. The wage calculation unit of agricultural products exerts a natural adjustment effect, which can save the complicated procedures of changing the wage base by other means.

　　Of course, different regions cannot use the same material, so it is not convenient for unified comparison; but other methods also cannot achieve the effect of unified comparison. Because, for example, the ratio between fen in the Northeast and flour in North China cannot be fixed. The same principle also applies to the cost of living index in different regions. This issue must be thoroughly resolved by monetary wages after the end of the war, the restoration of national transportation, the full development of trade, and the complete stabilization of prices.

　　Therefore, I humbly believe that the unit of millet calculation wages implemented in Beiping and other areas of North China does not need to be changed again at present.

　　Note: Most of the wage materials for European bourgeois countries are based on the International Labour Review (published by the International Labour Office) since 1924. They would not make the situation of workers seem worse than it actually is.

　　工作讨论：对工资单位的管见
    朱启明
    关于工资计算单位问题，朱启明君的这个系统的意见我们认为很有参考的价值，特刊出，供有关方面研究，并望展开讨论，以期获得最后的正确结论。现在已有于任林同志提出了相反的意见，也一并刊出。　
  　编者
    无论任何国家，只要她处在币值变动的时期，便会遇到一个更尖锐的名义工资与实际工资矛盾的问题。但除掉社会主义与新民主主义国家外，在资本主义、殖民地、半殖民地国家内，工人阶级却总是在这问题中遭受剧烈的、超过资本主义一般剥削率的更残酷的剥削：他们的实际工资永远是因货币贬值而降低。国民党反动派在八年消极抗战与三年反人民内战中，滥发了三种天文数字的货币——法币、关金券、金元券，使国统区各阶层人民，都遭受到空前的榨取；其中尤以工人及其他专靠固定薪给收入的劳动人民为甚。虽然由于广大人民的英勇反饥饿斗争，迫使其不得不定期或不定期的采取若干“调整”办法，但所有这些办法与通货膨胀的速度对照，只能形成一种讽刺性的比例。
    在解放区，就根本改变了这种情况：工资是以实物计发，使实际工资能保证在一定水准上。但，很显然的，如果解放区市场是百分之百稳定的，那我们也就毋须再讨论工资计算单位了。现实是：由于生产与革命战争的历史条件，我们只能做到一般物价平稳上升。要保持工资的一定购买力，就不得不求出一种实物的计算单位，在一个不变的数字上表示劳动者生活资料所得的量数。
    在全国解放区用来计算工资的单位，大致有两种类型：一种是仅包括一种实物的（如小米或玉米）；另一种是包括了几种实物的（如饻、分的计算法）。十九世纪初叶，在欧洲应用过，后来在两次世界大战中也被若干国家所采用过的生活指数的计算法，也曾被国民党反动派采用过。这种生活指数的实物种类，比饻、分更多。其原则是要概括薪资所得者的全部生活资料。这可以当做第三种类型，但其基本性质是与第二类型相似的。
    实物的种类愈多，愈切合工资所得者的生活资料的种类与各种消耗量的比例，实际工资的变动愈小，这是以生活指数计算的优点；但其缺点：一是在不同的地区内必须单独统计，另外还须要求得总的、全国性的生活指数，这样就造成了一定程度上的技术上的困难与复杂性。二、由于各种工业的原料开支与杂项开支的上涨率与工资不一致，因而使工业成本无法计算。这些困难即便在技术条件较高的国家，也从没有十分完满的克服过。所以，第一次世界大战后，欧洲也有些国家采用了以一两种食粮为计算单位的工资制，其性质颇近似我们的小米工资。而在采用生活指数计算法的那些资本主义国家，总是在指数发布日期、支付工资日期、工资使用日期的时间差异上造成工人的损失。这种损失之造成，除掉技术上的必然原因外，基本上还是由于在资本主义国家中，无论工资的决定是由劳资双方“协议”也好，或由政府“仲裁”也好，工人总不能操得决定权，而那些政权与资本家也总是尽力要使工人多吃一些亏的。在解放区如果采用生活指数发薪的办法，工人所蒙受的损失是可能避免的。但在成本计算上，若想得出一个不变的、起着某种程度上带有货币性质的数字来则十分困难。
    单一的实物计算单位，无论是在支付工资上，或在成本计算上，都十分简便，而工资与其他原料及杂项开支，也可以由这种共同实物求得一种统一的计算单位。不过，这种办法也有缺点，即是不能保证工资所得者对别种生活资料的不变的购买力。但这种缺点却只在两种情况之下才会发生：一是这种实物价格的涨落与其他生活资料不成正比的时候；二是在其他种生活资料中，有某几种突然脱离了正常规律而涨落的时候。只要这两种情况可以避免，则单一实物的工资计算单位，并不一定不能起物价指数的作用。在今天来说，上述两种情况却是可以避免的，其保证：新民主主义的经济政策中的贸易政策，是通过国家资本、公营贸易公司来掌握市场物价。我们检阅一下北平解放以来若干主要生活资料（如各种食粮，各种副食品、布匹、燃料等）的价格变动趋势，则得出一副波动不算太大的，互相交叉的徐徐上涨的曲线图。在各种曲线散布较宽的时期，居中的就恰是我们在北平所行的计算工资单位的小米。这就说明了人民政府对市场的领导，基本上防止了奸商的操纵倒把，保持了主要生活资料价格的比例的变动。
    当然，生活指数的计算法可以保持各种生活资料的数学上的定数。这一点，无论如何是小米工资所做不到的；但在这里权衡二者优劣的时候，却还须要注意以下两个问题：一是这种数学的定量仅仅是数学的。也就是说，仅是帐篇上的：因为，物价指数上的物价是计算日期中的平均物价，与工资所得者实际购买生活资料时的物价，总会有所差别，也决不可能完全成数学比例的变动。因此，这种帐篇上的定量是不够现实的。二是物价指数上生活资料的种类与数量，对工资所得者每一时期的实际购买量来说，也不均衡。例如，每一月或每半月都要买布的人是不多的，一个工人的工资在其生活指数的计算表上每半月有一尺布，但他决不会把一件衣服的布分成七、八次去购买。从上述两点来考虑，可知在各种生活资料大致按比例变动其价格的条件下，小米工资与生活指数工资在工人的实际生活中不会感到差异。
    分与饻的计算法，在城市未解放前，是切合实际的办法。但就目前情况说来，单一实物计算的缺点既可以通过对市场的正确领导而予以防止，则更复杂的办法就不一定必要了。
    有一种可能是存在的：今后工业生产逐渐恢复与发展，工业品价格相对降低，农产品价格相对升高，这种趋势一方面意味着农民的所得增加，另方面在以一种主要农产品做计算单位的条件下，职工生活也得到改善，这趋势是合理的，理想的。农产品的工资计算单位就发挥了一种自然的调节作用，可以省却以其他办法而又要改变工资基数的烦复手续。
    当然，不同地区是不能采用同一实物的，因此也就不便于统一比较；但其他方法也同样不能收统一比较之效。因为，例如东北的分与华北的饻的比值，就是不能固定的，同样的道理也适用于不同地区的生活指数。这问题必待战争结束，全国交通恢复，贸易充分发达，物价完全稳定之后，重新由货币工资来求得彻底解决。
    所以，管见以为北平及华北其他地区所实行的小米计算工资的单位，目前并无再加变动的必要。
    注：关于欧洲资产阶级国家的工资材料，大部根据一九二四年以来的国际劳工月刊（国际劳工局出版）。他们是不会把工人的情况说得比实际更坏的。
