　　Celebrating the Opening of the Pingbao Section
  　Baoding City Holds Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony
  　Minister Teng Encourages the Building of a People's Railway
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] This newspaper reporter Chen Ji reports: The opening ceremony of the Pingbao section of the Pinghan Railway was solemnly held yesterday (the 20th) at Baoding City Railway Station. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Railway Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, representatives from various departments of the Pingjin Railway Administration, leading figures from the Party, government, and military of the Jizhong District and Baoding City, mass organizations such as the Trade Union and Women's Federation, and more than 3,000 employees from over 20 units, including the First and Second Engineering Teams and the Bridge Construction Team of the Pingbao Section Road Construction Office, attended and participated. The conference was presided over by Comrade Meng Xianzhang, Director of the Pingbao Section Road Construction Office. After reporting on the repair of the section, he emphasized the considerable role played by the leading organs of the Party, government, and military in the Jizhong and Beiyue areas, as well as the assistance and cooperation of the broad masses of farmers, in this project, which overcame the shortage of materials and transportation difficulties, enabling the project to be completed ahead of schedule on May 3rd, ensuring the task of opening the railway on May 20th. Minister Teng Daiyuan's speech was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. He explained in detail the significance of the opening of the Pingbao section in military, political, and economic terms: the restoration of the Pingbao section is the beginning of the connection of the north-south main line of the Pinghan Railway. In the future, the abundant materials of the Hebei Plain can be exchanged with areas inside and outside the customs through this artery, strengthening urban-rural relations and industrial and commercial development. He also encouraged all employees to continue their efforts and strive to build a People's Railway. Comrades Yu Chuan, Director of the Jizhong Administrative Office, Sun Yi, Commander of the Jizhong Military Region, Gao Yuan, representative of the Transportation Department of the North China People's Government, Secretary Wen, representative of the Beiping Military Control Commission, and Li Lianshan, Deputy Director of the Pingjin Railway Workers' General Union, also spoke successively, expressing their infinite respect for the workers' enthusiastic spirit in repairing the Pingbao section. Li Yong, the locomotive chief of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive and a labor hero, assured the employees of the Pingbao section: "Wherever you repair south, we will drive the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive to." After the meeting, Minister Teng Daiyuan and others presented medals and banners to more than 50 labor models for road construction and bridge building. Elementary school students from the Baoding Rotary Club put red flowers on each labor model, and the whole audience cheered and applauded. The faces of the labor models showed a smile of victory. At 1:10 p.m., the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening of the railway was held. The "Mao Zedong," "Baoding Liberation," and "Changxindian Striving Forward" locomotives slowly drove out of the station amidst the melodious music. The masses on both sides of the railway cheered, and the people's train was loved by the masses. The "Baoding Liberation" and "Mao Zedong" trains carried all the labor models and guests from all walks of life to Beiping at around 4 p.m., where they were warmly welcomed by the staff of each section and station along the way, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. They arrived at Beiping East Station at 11:30 p.m. It is noted that the Pingbao section is 145.4 kilometers long and is an important transportation route to the south of Ping. During the Anti-Japanese War and the early period of the People's Liberation War, Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits used it to continuously invade our Jizhong and Beiyue liberated areas and suck the local abundant production. With the assistance of farmers along the line, the People's Liberation Army continuously carried out sabotage on the line in order to trouble the enemy and protect the interests of the masses. After the liberation of Beiping, the People's Government and the Railway Department planned to rebuild the line. Railway workers first showed the greatest enthusiasm. For example, the Beihe Railway Bridge, which is 209 meters long, was repaired by more than 100 workers in two days. Farmers along the line also fully supported the effort, and tens of thousands of carts were mobilized. After the restoration of the Pingbao section, transportation in Jizhong and Jibei became more convenient, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas will be smoother. Salt, coal, and other industrial products from Pingjin can be continuously imported into rural areas, and cotton, grain, and mountain goods from Jizhong and Beiyue can be supplied to cities in large quantities. The railway can more effectively support the People's Liberation War, which is about to achieve complete victory, and reduce many corvées for farmers, allowing them to be used for production. This is the reason why workers and farmers are actively rebuilding the road.
    [Jizhong, 20th Dispatch] More than 3,000 people held a grand gathering at Baoding Railway Station to welcome the "Mao Zedong" locomotive from Ping. The "Baoding Liberation" locomotive, which has been magnificently decorated, is parked under the tall arch, and the huge statue of Chairman Mao on the front of the locomotive, along with various colored lights, looks forward to the far north. The platform is crowded with workers, students, Yangko dancers, and cadres from the Jizhong and Baoding municipal organs who came to welcome it. When the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, driven by labor hero Comrade Li Yong, entered Baoding Railway Station, flags were flying on the platform and on the locomotive, and people cheered and sang. Slogans, military music, gongs and drums, applause, and the loud roar of the locomotive combined into a magnificent symphony. Meng Xianzhang, Director of the Pingbao Section Road Construction Office, announced the opening of the meeting amidst cheers. Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, spoke first, introducing the origin of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive and the heroic deeds of Comrade Li Yong, and said: In the future, we will restore all the railways in the country. Wherever our army fights, we will repair there. With the victory of the front line, we will drive the locomotive to Hankou and Guangzhou. Our locomotives will run on every railway in the country. Subsequently, Yang Shijun, representative of the Baoding Railway Trade Union, and others presented flowers to the "Mao Zedong" locomotive team. As the sun set below the horizon, a welcome party was held amidst the sound of gongs and drums.

　　庆祝平保段通车
  　保市举行剪彩礼
  　滕部长勉励建设人民铁道
    【本报讯】本报记者陈迹报导：平汉路平保段通车典礼昨（廿日）在保定市车站隆重举行，中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部滕代远部长、平津铁路管理局各处室代表、冀中区及保定市党政军首长与工会、妇会等群众团体以及平保段筑路处第一二工程队与桥工队员工等廿余单位三千余人出席参加。大会由平保段筑路处主任孟宪章同志主持。在他报告了该段修理经过之后，着重地指出冀中、北狱两区党政军领导机关及广大农民群众协助配合的力量，在这段工程中起了相当大的作用，克服了材料缺乏及运输的困难，使得这段工程提前于五月三日完成，保证了五月二十日通车的任务。滕代远部长致词时，全场热烈鼓掌。他详细说明了平保段通车在军事、政治、经济各方面的意义：平保段的修复是平汉南北铁道干线贯通的开端，今后河北平原丰富的物资可以借着这条动脉与关内外交流，加强城乡关系与工商业发展。他并鼓励全体员工还得再接再厉，努力建设人民铁道。冀中行署主任玉川同志、冀中军区孙毅司令员、华北人民政府交通部代表高原同志、北平军管会代表温秘书、平津铁路职工总会副主任李连山同志等相继致词，对于工人们热情修复平保段的工作精神，表示无限的敬意。“毛泽东号”机车长劳动英雄李永同志向平保段员工保证：“你们向南修到哪儿，我们就把‘毛泽东号’开到哪儿。”会后，由滕代远部长等向五十余个修路筑桥的劳动模范颁发奖章旌旗，保定扶轮小学生给每个劳动模范带上红花，全场欢呼鼓掌，劳动模范们的脸上现出了胜利的微笑。下午一时一刻，举行通车剪彩仪式，“毛泽东号”“保定解放号”“长辛店努力前进号”在悠扬的音乐声中，徐徐开出车站，铁路两侧群众欢声四起，人民的火车受到了群众的热爱。“保定解放号”“毛泽东号”列车分别在下午四时左右，载着全体劳动模范及各界来宾，光荣的开往北平，沿途各段站职工列队欢迎，情绪空前热烈。晚十一时半抵达北平东站。按：平保段全长一四五点四公里，为平南交通要道。在抗日战争期间及人民解放战争初期，日寇及国民党匪帮曾据以不断进犯我冀中与北狱解放区，并吸吮当地各种丰富出产。人民解放军在沿线农民协助下，不断对该线实行破击，借以困扰敌人，保护群众利益。北平解放后，人民政府及铁道部即筹划重建该线，铁路工人首先表现了最大的热情，例如：长达二○九公尺的北河铁桥便桥，百余工人两天内即行修通。沿线农民亦全力支援，仅出动的大车即达数万辆。平保段修复后，冀中、冀北交通更加捷便，城乡物资交流将益通畅。平津的食盐、煤炭及其他工业品可源源输入农村，冀中、北狱的棉花、粮食、山货可大量供给城市。铁路能更有力的支援即将获得彻底胜利的人民解放战争，减轻农民许多力役，使其用于生产。这就是工人、农民积极重修该路的原因。
    【冀中二十日电】保定车站上三千余人举行盛大集会，欢迎由平开来的“毛泽东号”机车。已装饰得很壮观的“保定解放号”机车，停在高大的彩牌下面，车头上的毛主席巨像，和各种彩灯，展望着远远的北方，站台上挤满着工人、学生、秧歌队，并有冀中及保市机关干部人员前往欢迎。当“毛泽东号”机车在劳动英雄李永同志驾驶下开入保定车站时，站台上、机车上旗帜飘扬，人们欢呼歌唱。口号声、军乐声、锣鼓声、掌声和机车隆隆的巨响，合成一片雄壮的交响乐。平保段筑路处孟宪章主任，在一片欢呼下宣布开会，首由平津铁路局刘建章副局长讲话，他介绍“毛泽东号”机车的来历和李永同志的英雄事迹，并说：今后我们要修复全国所有的铁路，我们的军队打到哪里，我们就修到哪里，随着前线的胜利，要把机车开到汉口、广州去，我们的机车将开遍全国每条铁路上。随后保定铁路工会代表杨士俊等给“毛泽东号”机车小组献花。太阳降落地平线时，在锣鼓喧天中，举行了欢迎晚会。
