(Jinnan Dispatch) Hua County, Qinghe, Ji County and other places, on the basis of the majority of completed cotton planting plans, proposed widespread inspections and targeted lagging villages and households. The content of the inspection includes: the situation of planting cotton, the situation of reserving sesame land, and the situation of cotton, millet, and sorghum emergence. The inspection method is that district cadres cooperate with the community inspection team to lead village cadres separately to conduct inspections according to the plans set by each household. For lagging villages, the leadership of the branches and village cadres must be strengthened to make them act quickly; for lagging households, patient mobilization should be carried out to break their concerns and solve their difficulties to ensure the realization of the planting plan. Wang Laohe, a 67-year-old man in Xiaowei Village, Er District, Ji County, remembered what his father had taught him: "Don't plant cotton if it doesn't rain, or it won't come out." The village was buzzing with planting, but he was still at home and didn't move. On May 6th, his wife went to the field and saw that other people's seedlings had emerged, but her own field was still a blank. She hurried home and dragged Laohe to the field to see. Laohe saw that other people's cotton was growing very well, and he blamed himself: "There is nothing to say, I have been fooled." The village cadres also encouraged him to plant immediately, and it was not too late. The next day, the whole family mobilized to plant seven acres of cotton.

　　冀南清河等县
  　种棉计划大部完成
  　普遍检查突击落后村
    【冀南电】华县、清河、冀县等地，在种棉计划大部完成基础上，提出普遍进行检查，突击落后村、落后户。检查的内容：点种棉花情形，留芝麻地情形，棉花、谷子、高粱出苗情形等。检查方法、由区干配合小区检查组，分头带领村干，按各家订的计划进行检查。对落后村要加强对支部、村干的领导，使之迅速行动起来；对落后户进行耐心地动员，打破其顾虑，解决其困难，保证种植计划实现。冀县二区小魏村六十七岁的王老合死记住他父亲教训他的话：“天不下雨不要耩棉，了也不出。”村里点种闹的轰轰烈烈，他还是在家里不动弹。五月六日，他老婆到地里去，看见人家的苗都出来了，自己的地还是一片白，赶忙跑回家拉着老合到地里去看，老合一看人家的棉出的很好，自己埋怨自己：“什么也不用说了，上了当了。”村干又鼓励他马上点种还不算晚，次日，全家总动员便点种棉七亩。
