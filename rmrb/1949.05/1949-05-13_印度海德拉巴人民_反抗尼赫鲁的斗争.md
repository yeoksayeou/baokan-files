    The Indian People of Hyderabad
    The Struggle Against Nehru
    (I) Hyderabad is a famous princely state in India, with an area of 82,700 square miles and a population of 17 million. The vast majority of residents are landless peasants. A small number of feudal landlords occupy the vast majority of the land. The autocratic ruler, the Nizam family, owns one-tenth of the total area of the state. Apart from the landlords, no peasant family in many villages owns an inch of land. Due to the extreme poverty of the people, the children of landless agricultural laborers and poor peasants are forced to fend for themselves in childhood. Children aged eight to ten have to go out to work. They have to work 14 or 15 hours a day, but their monthly wage is as low as 20 pounds of rice. In addition, the landlords and village officials extort the peasants in many ways, which are impossible to calculate. For example, any farmer must pay a tax of one to twenty rupees (thirteen rupees equal one pound) to the landlord when they get married.
    In this situation, the peasants rose up in resistance. In order to crush the Nizam's tyrannical rule, 2,000 young peasants took up arms and organized many guerrilla units. They were convinced of the justice of their cause and entered the battle with heroic spirit. These guerrillas, known as "Dalams," were 90 percent from agricultural workers or poor peasants—the most exploited class in the countryside. At the same time, 200 students in the cities of Suryapet, Nalgonda, and Hyderabad have left school and returned to the countryside to actively participate in guerrilla warfare or other work.
    The peasant movement is particularly strong in the Telangana province, which has a population of 9 million. In 2,000 villages in the two districts of Nalgonda and Warangal in the province, in an area of 10,000 square miles and a population of 3 million, people's committees have been established by the people's own liberation army. The Nizam's rule has been completely destroyed, and the village people's committees have become the government.
    The village committee is elected by all adult residents. Everyone over the age of eighteen has the right to vote and be elected. The people of Telangana learned the meaning of "voting" for the first time. The village committee solves all problems and disputes in the village, from quarrels between husband and wife to land issues. The members of the village committee must respect the will of the people, because the villagers have the right to replace any of them at any time. In some villages, wealthy peasants who had served as members of the village committee were replaced because they sided with the rich in land disputes and even undermined land reform.
    Many extremely important reforms have been implemented, and about 1.2 million acres of land have been distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. Thousands of livestock and thousands of maunds (one maund equals eighty pounds) of grain confiscated from landlords and special detachments have also been distributed. All old debts have also been abolished. In every village in Hyderabad, virtually every peasant family is in debt, and the annual interest rate is sometimes as high as 120 percent. The importance of debt abolition to the people can be seen from this. In these liberated areas, all social evils, such as the taboo of untouchability of the untouchables and the authority of husbands to beat their wives, have completely disappeared.
    (II) The Nizam carried out cruel suppression of the peasant movement. He organized a fascist special detachment called the "Razakars." In Nalgonda and Warangal, where the peasant movement was most developed, in an area no more than one-eighth of Hyderabad, the Nizam concentrated 20,000 of its 90,000 special detachment members and 10,000 of its 50,000 regular troops. Their atrocities against the people can only be compared to those in Nazi-occupied Europe. From January to mid-September 1948, in less than nine months, 1,500 people were slaughtered, 1,000 women were raped, 10,000 houses were burned down, and property worth 50 million rupees was looted in the above-mentioned two districts alone. Some villages were completely burned down. The number of people who suffered torture and various forms of severe punishment was even more in the thousands.
    However, although the Nizam's special detachments did their utmost to brutalize the unarmed people, they turned and fled at the sound of guerrilla gunfire. They only dared to come out in large numbers to loot villages and retreated to their camps before dark. In a forest area of 500 square miles, they only dared to loot one village in five months. In nine months, the guerrillas killed 1,500 of the Nizam's police, special detachments, and local lackeys.
    (III) The heroic struggle of the people of Telangana has not only won the sympathy and support of the working people of Andhra Pradesh, who speak Telugu, but also the sympathy and support of the whole country. However, it has also aroused the hostility of the Indian government headed by Nehru. Although Nehru and the Nizam still had some differences on the conditions for Hyderabad's merger with India and the shares of plundering Hyderabad's peasants, this did not prevent the Nehru government from supplying the Nizam's bandits with weapons under the truce agreement concluded in November 1947. On September 13, 1948, the Indian army entered Hyderabad, declaring that its purpose was to restore "law and order" and protect the people from the ravages of the special detachments. However, what this "law and order" was soon became clear. On the eve of the Indian army's entry into Hyderabad, the Governor-General of India assured the Nizam that he personally and his property would not be harmed, and that the Indian army's entry was only because the Hyderabad government had failed to effectively solve the communist threat. The battle between the Indian army and the Nizam's army ended within five days. The Nizam's entire ruling structure was not changed at all. As soon as the fighting between them ended, India, under the command of the Indian Military Governor, began to attack the villages of Telangana. They, like the Nizam's bandits, implemented a policy of rape, arson, and murder.
    (IV) The people of Telangana are unwilling to surrender. They are determined to fight to protect their goals. Although they know that their struggle is arduous and difficult, they are confident that they will be victorious. A guerrilla fighter, when answering a question, said: "Yes, the Indian army is indeed much stronger than the Nizam's army. But our training and equipment are also better than before. If we have victoriously fought against the Nizam with fewer weapons, then we can also fight against the Indian government."
    The young warriors of Telangana are greatly encouraged in their struggle by the victory of the world's democratic forces. They said, "In the Soviet Union, poor people like us fought and won, established their own government, and supported the working people of the world." At the same time, they heard about the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. They spoke with admiration about the struggles of their neighbors—the people of Burma, Malaya, Vietnam, Indonesia, and especially the imminent demise of Chiang Kai-shek in China before the People's Liberation Army.
    The guerrilla commander said when talking about China: "In China, they also started like us. But look where Chiang Kai-shek is today? In India, we will not need so many years, because many countries and people who stand on the same front as us have already achieved victory, and are much stronger than the friends of the Nizam and the Indian government."

### 印度海德拉巴人民  反抗尼赫鲁的斗争

    印度海德拉巴人民
    反抗尼赫鲁的斗争
    （一）海德拉巴是印度的有名土邦，面积八二·七○○平方哩，人口一千七百万。绝大部分居民都是无地的农民。一小撮的封建地主占了绝大部分的土地，它的专制统治者尼萨姆一家，就占有土邦全部面积的十分之一。除了地主以外，许多村庄中没有一家农民占有一英寸的土地。由于人民的极度贫穷，无地的农业工人和贫农的儿女，被迫地在儿童时代就去自谋生存。八岁至十的岁儿童们就要出去帮工。他们每天必须工作十四五小时，但每月工资却低至只有二十磅米。此外，地主和村里的官员对农民的榨取，更是种类繁多，无法计算。例如，任何农民在结婚时，都必须向地主缴纳一卢比至二十卢比（十三卢比等于一英镑）的捐税。
    在这种情况下，农民起来反抗了。为了粉碎尼萨姆的暴虐统治，青年农民二千人拿起武器，组织了许多游击队。他们确信他们事业的正义性，并以英雄的气概进入了战斗。这些被称为达拉姆的游击队员，百分之九十都是出身于农业工人或贫农——农村中最受剥削阶层。同时，在苏利亚贝特、纳莱冈达和海德拉巴等城的学生二百人，已离开了学校，回到农村中来积极参加游击队或其他工作。
    农民运动在据有九百万人口的特伦冈纳省，特别强大。在该省纳冈达和瓦伦加两个区的二千个村庄中，在有一万平方哩面积和三百万人口的地区中，人民委员会已由人民自己的解放军建立起来。尼萨姆的统治已完全被摧毁，村的人民委员会成为政府。
    村委员会是由全体成年居民选出的。年满十八岁的每个人均有选举权与被选举权。特伦冈纳的人民第一次知道了“投票”的意义。村委员会解决村中的一切问题与争端，从夫妻吵架直到土地问题。村委员会的委员们必须尊重人民的意志办事，因为村民有权在任何时候撤换他们中的任何人。在若干村中，曾任村委员会委员的富农都被撤换了，因为他们在土地纠纷中站在富人方面，甚至破坏土地改革。
    许多极重要的改革，已被实行，约有一百二十万亩土地已被分给无地与少地的农民。从地主和别动队手中没收过来的成千头牲畜和成千毛德（一毛德等于八十磅）粮食，也都分配了。一切旧债也被废除了。在海邦各个村庄中，实际上每个农民家庭都负债，而且年利率有时多达百分之一百二十。废债对人民的重要性，由此可见。在这些已解放的地区，一切社会恶习，如贱民不可接触的禁忌，丈夫打老婆的威权等，已完全消失。
    （二）尼萨姆对农民运动实行了残酷的镇压。他组织一种名叫拉沙卡的法西斯别动队，在农民运动最发展的纳冈达和瓦伦加，在这面积不超过海邦八分之一的地区内，尼萨姆集中了它九万别动队中的两万人员的全部正规军，非正规军五万人中的一万人。他们对人民的暴行只有纳粹占领下的欧洲，差堪比拟，从一九四八年一月至九月中旬在不到九个月内，仅在上述两个地区中就有一千五百人被屠杀，一千妇女被强奸，一万所房子被焚毁，价值五千万卢比的财产被抢走。有些村庄完全被烧光。遭受拷打和各种严刑的人，更是成千成万。
    然而，尼萨姆的别动队虽然对赤手的人民极尽其残暴之能事；但是他们一听到游击队员的枪声，就掉头逃命，他们只敢大队出来抢掠村庄，并在天黑以前就缩回军营里去。在一个有五百平方哩的森林地带，他们五个月中只敢出来抢了一个村庄，九个月中，游击队打死了尼萨姆的警察、别动队和地方走狗一千五百人。
    （三）特伦冈纳人民的英勇战斗不仅赢得说塔来哥语的安德拉省劳动人民的同情与支持，而且赢得了全国的同情与支持。可是，它也引起了以尼赫鲁为首的印度政府的仇视。尼赫鲁和尼萨姆虽然在海德拉巴合并于印度的条件上和双方掠夺海邦农民的股份又有些分歧，但这并不妨害尼赫鲁政府根据一九四七年十一月缔结的停战协定，供给尼萨姆匪帮以武器。一九四八年九月十三日，印度军队开入海德拉巴，宣布他的目的是恢复“法律与秩序”，保护人民免遭别动队的残害。但是，这种“法律与秩序”究竟是什么，很快就暴露出来。在印军开入海邦的前夕，印度总督向尼萨姆保证说：他个人和他的财产将不受损害，印军之开入只是因为海邦政府未能有效地解决共产党的威胁。印军和尼萨姆军队间的战斗五天内就结束了。尼萨姆的整个统治机构毫未改动。他们之间的战斗一结束，印度即在印度军事总督的命令下，开始袭击特伦冈纳的各个村庄。他们和尼萨姆匪帮一样，实行奸淫烧杀的政策。
    （四）特伦冈纳的人民绝不愿投降。他们决心为保护他们的目标而战。他们虽然知道他们的斗争是艰苦而困难的，但确信他们将获得胜利。一个游击队员在回答一个问题时说：“是的，印军确实比尼萨姆军队要强得多。但是我们的训练与装备也比以前更好了。如果我们曾以更少的武器对尼萨姆胜利作战，那么我们也能对印度政府作战”。
    特伦冈纳的青年战士们在战斗中，从世界民主力量的胜利方面获得很大的鼓舞。他们说：“在苏联，象我们这样的穷人曾经战斗而获胜，建立了自己的政府，并支援着全世界的劳苦大众。”他们同时听到东欧新民主国家。他们以赞美的心情谈论着他们的近邻——缅甸、马来亚、越南、印尼等地人民的战斗，尤其是中国蒋介石在人民解放军面前的即将灭亡。
    游击队司令在谈到中国时说：“在中国，他们也象我们这样开始的地，但是，看看蒋介石今天哪里去了？在印度，我们将不需要那么多的年头，因为许多国家与我们站在一条战线上的人已经取得胜利，并且比较尼萨姆和印度政府的朋友强大得多。”（摘译自世界民主青年联盟出版的“青年反对殖民主义”月刊二月号）
