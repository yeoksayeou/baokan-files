Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Moscow dispatch: The Labor Daily commented on the upcoming Labour Party conference in Blackpool (Lancashire), stating: The Labour Party's top leadership is attempting to portray its policy of currying favor with domestic and foreign monopoly capitalists as establishing "communism." However, the Labour government's new budget reflects the essence of its policy of implementing the will of the British Industrialists Association and Wall Street. Therefore, even after nationalization, more than 30 percent of enterprises remain in the hands of monopoly capitalists. The author then pointed out: The Labour Party Executive Committee's pre-election declaration "to be discussed by the conference" completely dispelled all illusions of British voters. It is a program for monopoly capital to exploit the working people, it openly insults the Soviet Union, and it enthusiastically supports the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. The author also stated: In order to prevent organizations from submitting proposals, the Labour Party leadership even threatened to not nominate party members who insisted on criticizing government policies. However, local branches still submitted two hundred proposals, many of which expressed dissatisfaction with the reduction of government subsidies for housing plans, criticized the government for not making any effort to reduce employer profits, and expressed dissatisfaction with the wage freeze policy. The author concluded: Protests against the Labour Party leadership's policies greatly surprised the Labour Party leaders. Labour Party Home Secretary Ede forcibly implemented the three-month ban on political strikes in order to prevent workers from expressing their protests against the Labour Party leadership's anti-people policies on the eve of the conference.

　　劳动报评论将开幕的英工党会议说：
    讨好国内外独占资本家必然要遭全国人民反对
    【新华社北平十七日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报评论即将举行的工党布拉克奔（在兰开厦郡）会议称：工党最高领导机关企图把讨好国内外独占资本家的政策，说成是建立“共产主义”。但是，工党政府的新预算却反映出它们执行英国工业家协会和华尔街意志的政策之本质。因此，国有化以后，仍然有百分之三十以上的企业留在独占资本家手中。作者继即指出：工党执委会选举前的宣言“将由该会议加以讨论”完全驱散了英国选民的一切幻想。它是独占资本剥削劳动人民的纲领，它公开辱骂苏联，并热烈支持侵略性的北大西洋公约。作者又称：工党领导机关为阻止各组织提出议案，竟以不提名威胁坚持批评政府政策的党员。但是，各地支部却仍然提出了二百个提案，其中有许多表示对裁减政府住宅计划的津贴的不满、批评政府不作任何努力以减少雇主利润、并对冻结工资政策表示不满等等。作者结语称：对工党领导机关政策的抗议，使工党领袖大吃一惊。工党内政部部长伊迪强制执行禁止政治罢工三个月的命令，就是为的阻止工人在会议前夕表示他们对工党领导机关的反人民政策的抗议运动。
