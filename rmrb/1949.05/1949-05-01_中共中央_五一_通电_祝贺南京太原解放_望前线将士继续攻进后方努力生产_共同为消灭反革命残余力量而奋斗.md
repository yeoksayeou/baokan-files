Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 1st - The CCP Central Committee specially sent a telegram on May Day to congratulate the liberation of Nanjing. The telegram stated:

    Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrades Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all commanders and fighters of the two major field armies, all comrades of other field armies, local armies, and southern guerrilla forces, and fellow compatriots from all sectors of industry, agriculture, commerce, and education across the country:

    Our People's Liberation Army's Second and Third Field Armies, executing orders from the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, advanced bravely, crossed the Yangtze River, the enemy forces collapsed at the mere sight, Nanjing was quickly liberated, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was thus declared extinguished, and hundreds of millions of people south of the Yangtze River quickly saw the light of day again, the whole country rejoiced, and the world was encouraged. This is all the result of the heroic and skillful fighting of our frontline soldiers, the diligent support of the military and civilians in the rear, the vigorous assistance of the people south of the Yangtze River, and the unified coordinated actions of other field armies and local armies. On this great festival, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends its warm congratulations to you. The Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, colluded with imperialism externally and gathered all dark forces internally, establishing a bloody anti-national and anti-people rule centered in Nanjing, which has lasted for twenty-two years. The people of the whole country, with heartache and indignation, rose up to resist, one after another. The Kuomintang reactionaries are guilty of heinous crimes, having launched a counter-revolutionary civil war first, and then rejected the peace agreement, believing that the natural barrier of the Yangtze River could limit the advance of the People's Liberation Army. Unexpectedly, within three days of the People's Liberation Army crossing the river, the counter-revolutionary center of Nanjing was destroyed, and famous cities such as Anqing, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou were successively recovered. The entire Kuomintang army's Fourth Army, Twentieth Army, Twenty-eighth Army, Forty-fifth Army, Fifty-first Army, Sixty-sixth Army, Eighty-eighth Army, and Ninety-ninth Army, most of the Twenty-first Army, and parts of the Forty-sixth Army, Fifty-fourth Army, and Ninety-sixth Army were annihilated by us south of the Yangtze River, in the area north of the Changshu, Suzhou, Changxing, Guangde, Jingxian, and Pengze line, and we occupied the counties in the aforementioned areas. Now the entire situation is extremely favorable for the people and the People's Liberation Army. It is hoped that the frontline soldiers will continue to advance, the people in the rear will strive for production, and fellow compatriots from all walks of life will rise up to assist, and together fight to eliminate the remnant forces of counter-revolution, liberate the people of the whole country, and establish a unified, democratic, and new China.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, May 1, 1949

    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 1st - The CCP Central Committee specially sent a telegram on May Day to congratulate the liberation of Taiyuan. The telegram stated:

    Comrades Xu Xiangqian, Zhou Shidi, Luo Ruiqing, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front, and all military and civilians in Shanxi and North China provinces:

    The war criminal Yan Xishan and his reactionary clique had entrenched themselves in Shanxi, harming the people, for thirty-eight years, making him the longest-lasting warlord separatist in the country. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Yan bandits colluded and compromised with the Japanese invading army, and were enemies of the anti-Japanese people. In recent years, under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, the Yan bandits participated in the counter-revolutionary civil war, were repeatedly defeated, and finally retreated to a corner of Taiyuan, still stubbornly resisting. This time, our People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front was ordered to attack the city and quickly liberated it. Although the Yan bandits escaped, the gang of criminals were captured. The enemy forces in Datong also surrendered. From now on, the entire territory of Shanxi is cleared, and North China is consolidated. On this great festival, we extend our warm congratulations to you.

            The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, May 1, 1949

    中国人民解放军第二野战军刘伯承、邓小平、张际春诸同志，中国人民解放军第三野战军陈毅、饶漱石、粟裕、谭震林诸同志，两大野战军全体指挥员战斗员同志们，其他各野战军地方军及南方各游击部队全体同志们，全国工农商学各界同胞们：

    【新华社北平一日电】太原解放，中共中央特于五一节致电祝贺。电称：
    徐向前、周士第、罗瑞卿诸同志及太原前线人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员同志们，山西及华北各省全体军民同胞们：
    战犯阎锡山及其反动集团，盘据山西，危害人民，业已三十八年，为国内军阀割据为时最长久者。抗日时期，阎匪即与日本侵略军勾结妥协，与抗日人民为敌。近几年来，阎匪在蒋介石指挥下，参与反革命内战，节节溃败，最后退守太原一隅，犹作顽抗。此次我太原前线人民解放军奉命攻城，迅速解放，阎匪虽逃，群凶就缚。大同敌军，亦即投诚。从此山西全境肃清，华北臻于巩固。当此伟大节日，特向你们致热烈的祝贺。
