Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: The Northeast Film Studio has completed its first feature film. The film is titled "Bridge" and depicts the great achievement of railway factory workers in repairing the Songhua River Railway Bridge within one month in the spring of 1947, when the Northeast People's Liberation Army shifted to a full-scale offensive. At that time, the factory's chief engineer lacked confidence in the plan to complete the bridge piers in half a month, believing that "even with materials, it would take at least four months." However, after the mobilization of all employees by the factory director, who was of worker origin, and under the influence of Communist Party members and activists taking the lead, everyone used their brains and hands to overcome various difficulties and complete the entire plan on schedule. To film this movie, all the staff of the Northeast Film Studio went deep into the factory, personally experienced the workers' lives, cooperated with the workers, and overcame many technical and material difficulties. Filming began at the end of last December and was completed on April 20th of this year.

The Northeast Film Studio is the first film enterprise founded in the liberated areas and has a history of about three years. Over the past three years, under the wartime environment and materially difficult conditions, the factory has actively trained cadres and recorded newsreels, educational films, etc., achieving considerable success. Productions such as "Democratic Northeast" have been performed at home and abroad, and have been widely praised by audiences. In order to adapt to the development of the victorious revolutionary situation and actively carry out the construction of China's New Democratic film industry, our factory has been striving to film and record feature films since the second half of last year, and through the hard work of all staff members, we have finally achieved the success of "Bridge."

After the completion of the film, the Northeast Daily specially published an article entitled "Envisioning the Brilliant Future of People's Cinema." The article stated that in the history of Chinese cinema, this is the first film with the free working class as the protagonist and the New Democratic production struggle as the theme. Although this film is not perfect, in this sense, it is a work of epoch-making significance. Film is an artistic weapon with great persuasive and educational power, and when this artistic weapon is mastered by the working people, it will have a significant role in the construction of New Democratic culture. We therefore attach special importance to the film industry and support its growth and development in all aspects.

    “桥”东北电影制片厂
    完成第一部艺术片
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北电影制片厂已完成第一部艺术片。该片题名为“桥”，描写铁路工厂工人在一九四七年春东北人民解放军转入全面进攻时，在一个月内修竣松花江大铁桥的伟大业迹。当时，该厂总工程师对半月内修竣桥座等的计划缺乏信心，认为“即使有材料，至少也得四个月”。但全体职工经工人出身的厂长的动员，在共产党员和积极分子带头的影响下，大家动脑动手，战胜各种困难，如期完成了全部计划。东北电影制片厂为拍摄这部影片，全体工作人员会深入工厂，亲身体验工人生活，与工人们合作，克服了技术上和物质上的不少困难。从去年十二月底开始拍摄，至今年四月二十日完成。
    东北电影制片厂是解放区首先创立的人要的电影企业，已有约三年的历史。三年来，该厂在战争环境和设备困难的物质条件下，积极培养干部，录制新闻片、教育片等，获得了不少的成绩。出品中如“民主东北”等在国内外演出，深受观众赞誉。为了适应革命胜利形势的发展，积极进行中国新民主主义电影事业建设，我厂自去年下半年即努力拍摄录制艺术片，经全体工作人员的坚苦奋斗，终于取得了“桥”的成功。
    该片完成后，东北日报特著着“预视人民电影的光辉前途”。该文称，在中国电影史上，这是第一部以自由的工人阶级为主角，以新民主主义的生产斗争为主题的影片。虽然这部影片并未完美无缺，但从这种意义上讲，此片它是一部有着时代意义的作品。电影是一种有巨大说服教育力量的艺术武器，这种艺术武器，一些劳动人民所掌握，它就会在新民主主义的文化建设上有重大的作用。我们由此对电影事业特别加以重视，从各方面扶助其增长发展。
