　　Nanjing Prices Stable
　　Renminbi Credit High

    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Since the liberation of Nanjing, prices have been stable, and the Renminbi has been trusted by people of all classes. In the past month, the price of medium-ripe rice in Nanjing has remained at around 3,600 yuan per dan. The market has sufficient grain reserves, and the phenomenon of panic buying is no longer seen, which has basically stabilized people's lives. As the credit of the Renminbi continues to increase, small and medium-sized merchants believe that: with Renminbi, you can buy grain, so why bother exchanging it for "big heads" (referring to silver dollars)?

　　南京物价平稳
  　人民币信用高
    【新华社南京二十四日电】南京解放以来，物价平稳，人民币已为各阶层人民中所信任。月来南京中熟米每担始终保持在三千六百元上下，市上存粮充足，抢购现象已不复见，这基本上安定了人民的生活。由于人民币的信用日益提高，中小商人认为：有了人民币，就能买到粮食，何必去兑“大头”（指银元）？
