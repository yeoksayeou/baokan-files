Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 30th -- According to reports from various American news agencies: The United States representative to the United Nations, Jessup, visited the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, again in New York on the 27th to continue informal meetings on the Berlin issue. The meeting took place in the offices of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko also present. Jessup claimed that he was engaged in discussions on behalf of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. During the meeting, Jessup raised several questions with Malik and presented a memorandum regarding the possibility of ending various restrictions in Berlin and convening a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German question.

The US government's diplomatic probing on the Berlin issue has drawn the attention of world opinion. People have expressed doubts about the sincerity of this informal diplomatic negotiation, which has been reinforced by the recent acceleration of the US government's efforts to promote a divided West German state. A message from the United States Information Service on the 27th even claimed: "Authoritative sources in Washington emphasize that the end of various restrictions in Berlin and the determination of a date for the Foreign Ministers' Conference will not hinder the work of establishing the Federal Republic of Germany in the western occupation zones." Under pressure from the United States, the delegation of the so-called "Bonn Parliament" has urgently reached an "agreement" with the military governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the draft "constitution" of West Germany. Representatives of the six countries of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have signed an agreement in London to establish the Ruhr International Control Authority. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have announced the organization and procedures of the West German High Commission. The actual actions of the United States are the best answer to whether the US government is sincere in negotiating a resolution to the Berlin issue and even the entire German question.

    美代表再访马立克
    续商柏林问题
    美帝究有几分诚意颇可怀疑
    【新华社北平三十日电】据美国各通讯社报道：美国驻联合国代表耶塞普，二十七日在纽约再访苏联驻安理会代表马立克，就柏林问题继续举行非正式会议。会谈系在苏联驻联合国代表团的办公室内举行，苏联副外长葛罗米柯亦在座。耶塞普自称他系代表美英法三国政府从事商谈。在会谈中，耶塞普向马立克提出了若干问题，并就美英法政府对于柏林方面各项限制的结束以及召开四国外长会议讨论德国问题之可能性提出了备忘录。
    美国政府此次在柏林问题上所进行的外交试探，引起了世界舆论的注视。它在此次非正式外交谈判中究竟有几分诚意，人们已表示怀疑，这已为美国政府在最近期间加紧推行分裂的西德国家的活动所强化。美国新闻处二十七日的消息竟然声称：“华盛顿权威方面力言，柏林方面各项限制之结束以及规定外长会议之日期，不致妨碍有关德国西部各占区成立德意志联邦共和国之工作在内”在美国的压力之下，所谓“波恩议会”的代表团，已与美英法军政府关于西德的“宪法”草案急迫地取得“协议”。美英法比荷卢六国的代表，已在伦敦签订建立鲁尔国际管制局的协定。美英法政府已经公布西德高级委员会的组织与程序。美国的实际行动是美国政府究竟有没有诚意协商解决柏林以至整个德国问题的最好答案。
