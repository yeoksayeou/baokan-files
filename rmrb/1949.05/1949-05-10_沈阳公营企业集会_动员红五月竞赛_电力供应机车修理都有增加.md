【Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station Broadcast】 Shenyang, 9th dispatch: On the 5th of this month, public enterprises and factories in Shenyang held a Red May Production Competition Mobilization Rally in the Shenyang Municipal Government Auditorium. More than 1,400 worker representatives from over 40 units participated. Mayor Zhu Qiwen, Director Li Zhengfeng of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Bureau, and Jin Lijing, Minister of Labor Protection of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, all attended and spoke. They unanimously called on workers to step up production to support the front lines. At that time, workers from the tram, waterworks, and gas plants challenged other factories to a production competition, and other factories responded enthusiastically. The conference approved the establishment of a production competition assessment committee, electing 13 members, with Director Li Zhengfeng as the chairman and Li Zihou and Yi Xiaoguang as vice-chairmen.

【Another Dispatch】 The Northeast Electric Power Administration recently held a joint conference of electric power bureau directors to summarize the work of the past year. In the past year, electricity production nearly doubled compared to the previous year, and high-voltage transmission lines increased by 1,500 kilometers, ensuring electricity for urban transportation and industry and mining. The coal consumption rate for thermal power generation generally decreased by one-third to one-half, while the power supply increased by one and a half times compared to 1947, with 78 percent of it being used in industry and mining. At the same time, more than 600 section chiefs, division chiefs, factory directors, and technical cadres were trained and promoted, most of whom were workers. According to the development requirements of Northeast industry and mining this year and the instructions of the Ministry of Industry, the conference decided to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to ensure the restoration and development of industry, mining, and transportation, and to strengthen enterprise and democratic management. This year, the goal is to increase the power supply to twice that of 1948.

【Another Dispatch】: In the production competition commemorating "May Day" Labor Day, the "Standard Number" locomotive repaired by the Shenyang HuangguTun Railway Factory Locomotive Plant was completed six days ahead of schedule; the five broken passenger cars of the Passenger Car Plant were also repaired as good as new; in addition to completing its tasks, the Passenger Car Plant also repaired a scrapped car that could not be used. Forging, foundry and other factories have also completed their tasks in the production competition. Now the output of various factories has generally increased. Locomotive repairs have increased from an average of ten per month during the Kuomintang rule to seventeen; passenger cars from an average of eight per month to twenty-three; and freight cars from an average of thirty-six per month to seventy-one. The workers in various factories are now continuing to work hard to further improve the output and quality in May on the existing basis.
