Short Commentary

    Editor's Note: We agree with this self-criticism from the Southern Hebei Daily. The bureaucratic style of the Southern Hebei Water Conservancy Promotion Society should arouse vigilance in all regions. Therefore, we are publishing the full text of the newspaper's short commentary for reference.

    What do we learn from the working lessons of the Southern Hebei Water Conservancy Promotion Society?

    Firstly, it tells us that all management departments (and other departments as well) must fully possess a mass perspective of serving the people wholeheartedly and overcome a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. The Southern Hebei Water Conservancy Promotion Society, with 2.5 billion yuan (Hebei currency, same below) in capital, and responsible for promoting water conservancy throughout the region through operations, failed to clearly recognize the reality of Southern Hebei due to its profit-seeking viewpoint, believing that selling new waterwheels was more profitable than providing loans: the purchasing power of the masses was low, more than one-third of the waterwheels needed repair, buying a new waterwheel required more than 1,000 catties of rice, while repairing an old waterwheel only cost 200,000 yuan at the time; only after the purchasing power of the masses increased could they add new waterwheels. The operating principle should be to focus on repairing old waterwheels, combined with lending and selling new waterwheels, in a planned, differentiated, and step-by-step manner under the principle of supporting the masses in developing production. The society violated this principle and formulated a contrary operating principle, so that although the society was established for several months, only six new waterwheels ordered by the society were sold in the Third Special District, and few were loaned in the Fourth Special District, wasting the farmers' spring repair season, causing great losses to the water conservancy of fourteen counties near the river, accumulating a large amount of capital that could not be circulated, and suffering serious losses due to price fluctuations.

    Secondly, it tells us that we must be pragmatic in our work, conduct thorough investigations and research, and proceed from the demands of the masses at that time and place, opposing subjectivism. Because the society did not conduct careful investigation and research on the local situation, it blindly determined the operating principle and subjectively planned to sell 2,000 new waterwheels in the first half of the year. As a result, it violated the demands of the masses and was not welcomed by them, so that twenty waterwheels transported to Yongnian have not been sold to this day.

    Thirdly, it tells us that the leaders of management departments must be deeply rooted among the masses, be humble and democratic in their style, and oppose bureaucracy. The leadership of the society was neither proficient in business nor did it listen to the opinions of local governments and comrades in the society, and was covered with serious bureaucratic dust, so that this kind of mistake was not corrected for a long time. The Third Special District Office suggested a loan of 600 million to support local waterwheel repair, but it was not accepted by the society; when the waterwheels were first ordered, the local government suggested that the local order them, which would meet the requirements of local farmers, reduce costs, and support the development of local iron industry, but it was also not accepted by the society. As a result, hundreds of waterwheels were ordered from Shijiazhuang, hundreds of miles back and forth, the freight was high, the cost increased, and because the style was different and the quality was very poor, the masses were mostly unwelcome. March was the spring repair season, when we should vigorously lend, repair, and promote water conservancy. The responsible comrade of the society took the opportunity to move, and most comrades in the society disagreed, but correct opinions were not accepted. As a result, they left work alone and were busy moving, which caused great losses to water conservancy work.

    Finally, the leadership of the society also showed an unorganized and undisciplined phenomenon of not promptly requesting instructions and reporting, which caused the error to be concealed for a long time and not corrected.

    The society should carefully summarize, examine, and correct these lessons; other management departments should also learn from these lessons and be vigilant!

### 冀南水利推进社的教训

    冀南水利推进社的教训
    编者按：我们同意冀南日报这一检讨，冀南水利推进社的官僚主义作风值得引起各地警惕，为此，特将该报短论全文发表借供参考。
    从冀南水利推进社的工作教训中，告诉了我们一些什么呢？
    首先告诉我们所有经营部门（其他部门亦同样），必须充分具备全心全意为人民服务的群众观点，克服单纯营利观点。冀南水利推进社，是有着二十五亿元（冀钞，下同）的资金，和担负着通过经营推进全区水利事业责任的部门，因为存在着营利观点，认为贷款不如卖新水车获利大，便不能清醒地去认识冀南的现实：群众的购买力较低，尚有三分之一以上的水车需要修复，买一辆新水车需用米一千余斤，修复一辆旧水车当时只需二十万元；群众购买力增高后，才能再添置新水车。经营方针应该是在支持群众发展生产的原则下，有计划、有分别、有步骤地以修理旧水车为主，结合贷卖新水车。该社违背了此一原则，定出了相反的经营方针，以致该社虽成立数月，所订购之新水车，在三专区仅卖出六辆，在四专区亦贷出无几，白白的错过了农民春修季节，使近河十四个县份的水利遭受很大损失，积压了大批资金不能周转，且以物价变动使资金遭受了严重的亏损。
    其次告诉我们，在工作上必须实事求是，进行周密地调查研究，从当时当地的群众要求出发，反对主观主义。该社由于对本地情况未做精密地调查研究，盲目地确定了经营方针，主观计划在上半年推销新水车两千辆，结果违反了群众的要求，得不到群众的欢迎，以致运到永年的二十辆水车，至今没卖出一辆。
    再次告诉我们，经营部门的领导者，在作风上必须是深入群众，虚心、民主，反对官僚主义。该社领导上，既不精通业务，又不倾听当地政府和社内同志的意见，蒙上了严重的官僚主义的灰尘，以致使此种错误长期未得到纠正。三专署曾建议贷款六亿，扶助当地修理水车，未被该社接受；开始订购水车时，当地政府曾建议由当地订购，既适合当地农民要求，降低成本，又可扶助当地铁工业发展，亦未被该社接受，结果从石门订购百辆，往返数百里，运费高昂，成本提高，且因式样不同、质量很坏，群众多不欢迎。三月份正是处于春修季节，亟应大力贷修、推进水利之际，该社负责同志竟借故搬家，社内大部同志均不同意，但正确意见未被接受，结果扔下工作不管忙于搬家，使水利工作受到极大损失。
    最后，该社领导上还表现了不及时请示、报告的无组织无纪律现象，致使错误长期隐蔽未得纠正。
    这些教训，该社要好好总结检查纠正；其他经营部门，也应从这里吸取教训，引起警惕！
