    Xuanhua Oxygen Plant

    Overcomes Sabotage by Bandits

    Officially Produces Oxygen

    [Chahar News] The Xuanhua Oxygen Plant, which had been shut down for more than two years, officially produced oxygen on April 28 after repairs began in February this year. During the repair process, it was discovered that Li Jingshun, a rogue element who had served in the Chiang bandit army, sabotaged the plant's invitation to technical personnel. During the repair test run, he twisted off the "small lever" on the expansion valve head, a crucial part, to strike at the technical personnel invited by the plant, delaying the plant's oxygen production by four days. The loss caused by this sabotage included a shortfall of 600 bottles of oxygen, waste of labor, electricity, and equipment, totaling more than 1.2 million RMB. To protect the safety of the people's enterprises, the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission has ordered the Xuanhua Public Security Bureau to arrest and bring the criminal to justice. This oxygen plant is the only high-pressure chemical industry plant along the Ping-Sui Railway line, with a maximum daily output of 150 bottles. It was shut down in 1946 when the Chiang bandits occupied Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. Oxygen is a basic material for gas welding of steel in light and heavy industries.

    宣化氧气厂
    战胜匪徒破坏
    正式制出氧气
    【察哈尔讯】停工两年有余的宣化氧气厂自今年二月开始修复后，四月二十八日已正式制出氧气。该厂在修复中，曾发现当过蒋匪军的流氓分子李景顺破坏厂方邀请技术人员，并于修复试车时将极为重要的膨胀闸头上的“小梃”拧断，以打击被厂方邀来的技术人员，使该厂晚出氧气四天。是项破坏所造成的损失：少出氧气六百瓶、人工电力器材消耗等损失，共达人民币一百二十余万元。为保护人民企业的安全，张家口军管会已命令宣化市公安局将该犯逮捕法办。按该氧气厂为平绥沿线唯一高压化学工业，最高日产量为一百五十瓶。一九四六年蒋匪侵占张、宣时停工。氧气则为轻重工业熔接钢铁的气焊时的基本材料之一。
