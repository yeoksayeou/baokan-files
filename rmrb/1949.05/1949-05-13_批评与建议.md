    Strictly Guard Against奸商 Sabotage
    The Dingxing Promotion Agency, in order to supply farmers with salt, sent people to Beiping and Tianjin on March 9th to buy salt. The original plan was to first contact the Beiping Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative to establish business relations. However, the people sent did not follow the original plan. Instead, they were introduced by the manager of the Ruibin Garden Bathhouse on Hufangqiao Street in Beiping to buy sixty-seven packages of salt. After being transported back to the Dingxing agency, it was discovered that twenty-one packages were sweepings, containing all sorts of things and inedible. Our salt purchasing personnel were not thorough in their work, were careless, and did not follow the original plan. An investigation should be conducted, and the following suggestions are provided for the attention of economic cadres: 奸商 disregard public cadres, considering them laymen who are easy to deceive and don't understand quality, and therefore casually trick them.
    Therefore, our economic cadres should be reminded to pay close attention when dealing with private merchants, and prevent them from engaging in sabotage and speculation.

        Compile New Children's Reading Materials
    Replace Toxic Material Editor:
    I am an education cadre passing through Beiping. These past few days, I casually visited several primary schools, as well as the Children's Library in Zhongshan Park and some small market stalls renting out serialized comic books for children. I would like to write down some of my feelings for the reference of the education authorities and literary workers in Beiping and other newly liberated cities:
    (1) During the initial period of liberation, it is understandable that we temporarily use old textbooks because there is not enough time to publish a large number of new ones. However, it may not be appropriate to continue this way for an entire semester. The government should, as soon as possible, ban textbooks containing toxic material and replace them with new textbooks.
    (2) In libraries and small book stalls, all kinds of feudalistic and colonial ghost stories in comic strip form are still being instilled into children's minds. Haven't many children's books been published in the past liberated areas? Why can't some of them be reprinted? If there are not enough printing presses, there are now many small printing factories and bookstores. If they were to do this business in a planned way, wouldn't that be a win-win situation?

    Iron-Wheeled Vehicles Should be Strictly Prohibited from Using Highways Editor:
    On the road from Changzhi City to Gaoping, I encountered many iron-wheeled vehicles using the highway. This makes the road uneven, and in some places very narrow. When a car comes and an iron-wheeled vehicle also arrives, it is difficult to maneuver, and everyone is delayed. Uneven roads require more gasoline and easily damage parts, which is also detrimental to the iron-wheeled vehicles.
    I remember that the North China People's Government has already issued instructions prohibiting iron-wheeled vehicles from using highways. Everyone must take responsibility for regular inspection, supervision, and protection of our highways.

    严防奸商捣鬼
    定兴推进社为了供给农民食盐，于三月九日派人到北平和天津去买盐，原计划是先到北平市供销总社接洽业务关系，派去的人没有按原计划去做，由北平市虎坊桥大街瑞宾园澡堂经理介绍买妥食盐六十七包，运到定兴本社后发觉盐内有二十一包是扫地的盐，里边什么都有，不能吃。我们买盐的人工作不深入马虎大意，没有执行原订计划应作检查，并提出以下意见供给经济干部注意：奸商对公家干部轻视，认为外行是好欺骗，不懂好坏，因而随便捉弄。
    因此应提醒我们的经济干部和私商接洽业务关系时，一定严加注意，防止他们捣鬼投机。

        编印新的儿童读物
    代替有毒素的东西编辑同志：
    我是路过北平的一个教育干部，这两天，我随便参观了几处小学，还看了中山公园的儿童图书馆和一些小市场租赁儿童连续画的小书摊，愿把我的一点感觉写出来，供北平市以及其他新解放城市教育当局和文艺工作者参考：
    （一）在刚解放的时候，来不及出版大批课本，不得已暂用旧教材是可以的，但整学期这样进行下去，恐有些不妥当，政府应尽快取缔含毒素的教材，代之以新的课本。
    （二）在图书馆、小书摊上，各色各样的封建的、殖民地化的鬼神故事连环画等，依然向儿童的脑海里灌注，在过去解放区不是出过许多儿童读物吗？为什么不能翻印一些呢？如果是印刷不过来，现在有许多小印刷厂小书店，若有计划地让他们把这笔生意做一做，不是一举两得的事吗？
              齐进
    应严禁铁轮车走公路编辑同志：
    由长治市到高平，一路碰到铁轮车走汽路的很多，把路弄的高低不平，有的地方很窄，汽车来了，铁轮车也来了，调动不开大家都耽误时间。路不平要多费汽油，也很易损坏零件，对铁轮车也一样的不利。
    禁止铁轮车走汽路，记得华北人民政府已有这样的指示，大家必须负起责任，经常检查、督促、保护我们的公路。    李建廷
