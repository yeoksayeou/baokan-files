　　German Soviet Occupation Zone
  　Production Increases
    Prices Plummet
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] Shops in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany that sell goods without ration cards greatly reduced the prices of several consumer goods and grains on the 24th. The prices in some stores have now been reduced by thirty-six to thirty-seven percent. The Soviet Occupation Zone of Berlin completely abolished potato rationing on the 23rd. Berlin's democratic public opinion pointed out that the significant reduction in prices and the abolition of potato rationing undeniably prove the increase in production in the Soviet Occupation Zone and the achievements made by the two-year economic plan.

  　生产增加
    物价大降
    【新华社北平二十六日电】德境苏占区不需配给证出售货物的商店于二十四日大大降低若干消费品和粮食的价格。若干商店价格现在已降低了百分之三十六到三十七。柏林苏占区于二十三日完全废除了洋芋的配给制，柏林民主舆论指出：物价的大大减低和洋芋配给制的取消，无可辩驳地证明了苏占区生产的增加和实行两年经济计划所获得的成就。
