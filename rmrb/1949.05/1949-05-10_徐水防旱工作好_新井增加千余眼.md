Xushui's Drought Resistance Work is Good: Over a Thousand New Wells Added

[This newspaper dispatch] "County and district cadres go deep into the countryside, leading production with production," with the Party branch as the core and Party members taking the lead. This is the key to the great achievements Xushui County has made in its "drought control" and sowing work. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, the county made developing water conservancy and increasing paddy fields one of the important contents of this year's large-scale production campaign. The county's production promotion agency organized three well-digging teams to go to various districts and villages to dig wells, repair old wells, and promote "pipe waterwheels." As of April 15th, the county had dug 999 new wells, more than double the annual target of 500 wells. It had also loaned out 266 waterwheels and repaired over 40 old waterwheels. Under the direct leadership and organization of county and district cadres, five "horizontal dams" were built using the Bahe River's water conservancy, and tens of thousands of mu of dry land were universally watered thoroughly once, so there was no problem with sowing. After entering April, there were many winds and little rain, and the signs of drought began to appear. The county Party committee and the county People's Government immediately convened the county's third production meeting (April 15th), loudly putting forward the slogan of "preventing drought and preparing for disasters," calling on the masses to carry water for planting, and based on the actual situation of each district, drawing on the experience of Nanlongshan in digging "temporary earthen wells," formulated a plan for the county to increase the number of earthen wells by 660. After the meeting, three working groups were formed with the county Party committee as the core (seven county Party committee members, seventeen other department cadres), dividing the county into three drought prevention areas to strengthen leadership. Cadres at all levels in the county, districts, and villages went deep into the villages and households to specifically lead and help the masses in production. Rural Party members used their own model actions of active production to influence and drive the masses' production. Comrade Liu Xiaolin, a cadre of the Sixth District Office, personally helped the villagers in Jingshang Village dig wells, pull pulleys, and bail out mud. According to statistics from 14 villages including Sidi City in the Sixth District, from April 22nd to the end of the month, a total of 89 new wells were dug in nine days. At present, more than 300 new wells have been dug in the county. Including the previous wells, the county has increased the number of new wells by more than 1,300 this year. Now, this new upsurge of well-digging is in full swing, and the intense work of watering the land and carrying water for planting has also begun simultaneously. Whether at night or during the day, you can always hear and see the continuous turning and rhythmic sound of waterwheels and windlasses. When the reporter passed by Caohe Station, six or seven villagers were planting cotton in a field next to the road. Strong young men were carrying water, and an old lady in her sixties and a young woman were pouring water into the dug pits one ladle at a time. The old man with the gray beard, while sowing, replied to me: "Our whole family is working together!" Now, the cotton planting work in various districts and villages of the county is unfolding. County Chief Jin told the reporter: Even if it does not rain, the 80,000 mu cotton planting plan (approximately 10% of the county's cultivated land area) can be fully completed with the masses' increasing confidence in drought control and disaster preparedness, the rising enthusiasm for production, and the hard work and in-depth leadership of county and district cadres. According to a survey of nine households including Tian Shouchang in Daxinzhuang Village, Sixth District, they have a total of 210 mu of cultivated land, and have already planted 21.3 mu of cotton, exceeding the cotton planting plan of "one mu of cotton for every ten mu of land."

    徐水防旱工作好
    新井增加千余眼
    【本报讯】“县区干部深入农村，以生产领导生产”，支部为核心，党员领头干。这是徐水县目前“治旱”播种工作获得巨大成绩的关键。今年春耕开始时，该县便将开展水利增加水田作为开展今年大生产运动重要内容之一，县生产推进社组织了三个打井组分赴各区村打井和修理旧井和推广“管子水车”，至四月十五日全县已打新井九九九眼，超过全年打井五百眼的一倍，贷出水车二六六辆，修理旧水车四十余辆，在县区干部直接领导组织下，利用瀑河水利打“横水坝”五道，万亩旱田普遍上了一次足水，播种已毫无问题。入四月后风多雨少，旱象初露时，县委与县人民政府立时召开全县第三次生产会议（四月十五日），响亮提出“防旱备灾”的口号，号召群众担水点种，并根据各区的实际情况，吸收南龙山打“临时土井”的经验，拟出了全县再增打土井六六○眼的计划，会议闭幕后，紧接着以县委为核心（七个县委委员，十七个其他部门干部）组成了三个工作组，将全县划成三个防旱区加强领导。县区村各级干部都深入到村到户，具体领导和帮助群众生产，农村党员则以自己的积极生产的模范行动，影响和带动群众生产。六区区公所干部刘孝林同志，亲自在敬上村帮助老乡挖井、拉滑车、掏泥水。据六区四迪城等十四村统计，从四月二十二日到月底九天内，共打新井八十九眼。目前全县已挖新井三百余眼，连前全县今年已增加新井一千三百余眼，现在这一新的打井热潮正方兴未艾，紧张的浇地，担水点种工作也同时开始，无论夜晚或白天总会听见和看见水车、辘轳不停的转动和有节奏的响声。记者途经漕河车站时，六七个老乡正在路旁一块田地里点种棉花，壮年男子担水，一位六十多岁的老太太和一位年青的妇女一杓一杓的把水倒在刨好的坑窝里，那位花白胡子的老汉一面撒种一面回答我：“俺这是全家齐动手啊”！现在该县各区村的植棉工作正在展开，该县靳县长语记者：就是在不下雨的情况下，八万亩的植棉计划（约当全县耕地面积百分之十）在群众治旱备灾的信心日益加强，生产情绪日趋高涨和县区干部刻苦深入领导下，是可以全部完成的。据六区大辛庄村田寿昌等九户调查，共有耕地二百一十亩，已经点播棉花二十一亩三分，超过了“十亩田一亩棉”的植棉计划。  （田流）
