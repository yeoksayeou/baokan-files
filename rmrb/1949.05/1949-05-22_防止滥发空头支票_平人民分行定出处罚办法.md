　　Preventing the Abuse of Bouncing Checks
  　The Ping Municipal Branch of the People's Bank Defines Penalties
    [Reported by this newspaper] To prevent clients of various banks and financial institutions in the city from abusing checks and undermining the credit of negotiable instruments, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, in accordance with Article 19 of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Private Banks and Financial Firms in the North China Region," has formulated "Measures for Punishing Clients of Banks and Financial Firms Who Issue Bouncing Checks," which went into effect yesterday (May 21st). The measures are as follows: (1) If a bank or financial institution client issues a bouncing check, the paying bank or financial institution shall be responsible for reporting it to this Bank (referring to the People's Bank branch, same below). (2) If a bank or financial institution client issues a check to withdraw cash or presents it for exchange, and the check is returned due to insufficient funds, overdrafts exceeding the limit, or other reasons, the paying bank or financial institution shall issue a written warning for the first offense. (3) If a bank or financial institution client has a second returned check, the original check shall be retained, and the client's usual dealings shall be recorded in detail, item by item, attached to the intercepted check, and sent to the Financial Management Section of this Bank for verification. (4) Clients of banks and financial institutions who abuse bouncing checks in serious cases will not only be notified by this Bank to all banks and financial institutions in the city to cease dealings with the client, but will also be transferred to the court, which will impose a fine of up to one time the amount of the check issued by the drawer. (5) If a bank or financial institution conceals a client's second issuance of a bouncing check or uses other reasons to cover up the true cause of the returned check, once discovered, it shall bear joint and several liability.
