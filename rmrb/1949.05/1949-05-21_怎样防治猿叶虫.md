How to Prevent and Control Flea Beetles
    Qi Ruilin
    Flea beetles, also known as black turnip beetles or "ming ke lang," are extremely harmful to cruciferous vegetables. The adults are bluish-black, about five millimeters long, and resemble mung beans. Their wings are scattered with irregular coarse spots. The eggs are very small, long oval, bright orange, and smooth on the surface, with about twenty or so clustered together. The larvae are cylindrical, generally dark black with a yellowish tint, and have shiny, lacquer-black heads with well-developed mouthparts. The pupae are about six millimeters long, generally yellowish-brown, with short, black bristles on the back of each thoracic segment. This insect has one or two generations per year (one generation in Beiping, two generations in southern Hebei and Taihang Mountains), overwintering as adults. They emerge again in March of the following year to cause damage (if two generations occur, they begin to lay eggs in March, which hatch into larvae after about half a month. The mature larvae then pupate. The pupal stage lasts about a week before transforming into adults). They enter summer dormancy at the end of May and re-emerge to cause damage from late July to early August. They then lay eggs on the affected plants. The eggs hatch into larvae after a week, at which point they cause severe damage to cabbage. The mature larvae pupate, transforming into adults after a week, which is around October.

　　Control methods:
    1. Chemical control: (1) Lead arsenate and calcium arsenate: Mix two taels of lead arsenate or calcium arsenate in ten catties of clean water, stir well, and spray on the affected cabbage. The amount per mu depends on the size of the vegetables, about four to eight catties.
    (2) DDT: Use a 2% DDT powder or a high-concentration emulsion. Dilute the wettable DDT powder to a 2% water solution and spray on the affected vegetables. The amount per mu is limited to three to eight catties, depending on the size of the crop.
    (3)苦树皮 (Ku Shu Pi, Sophora Flavescens Ait): A native insecticidal plant of North China, its powder or liquid can be scattered or sprayed on the affected vegetables to kill flea beetles.

    2. Prevention: In fields where this insect is most severe, cultivate other non-cruciferous vegetables or crops. Alternatively, when harvesting, place yellow leaves and waste stems (especially radish stalks) on the ground. At this time, as the food source suddenly decreases, the insects will gather under these discarded materials, making it easier to collect and capture them.

　　怎样防治猿叶虫
    齐瑞霖
    猿叶虫又称乌谷虫、明克螂，对十字花科蔬菜为害极大。成虫蓝黑色，长约五公厘，很象绿豆。翅膀散生不规则的粗点。卵甚小，为长椭圆形，呈鲜橙黄色，表面光滑，每二十余粒集成一堆。幼虫为圆筒形，全体淡黑而微黄，头部漆黑色，有光泽，口器发达。蛹体长约为六公厘，全体黄褐色，背胸各节后稍有黑色短小的硬毛。此虫每年发生一代或二代（北平一代冀南太行等地两代），以成虫过冬，来年三月再出来为害（如发生两代三月即开始产卵，约经半月孵化成为幼虫。幼虫老熟后再化蛹。蛹期约一周即变为成虫）。至五月末入土夏眠，七月末至八月初又出来为害。随即产卵于被害的植物上。卵经一周后孵化成为幼虫，此时为害白菜极烈。幼虫老熟后化蛹，一周后变为成虫，此时正是十月间。
　　防治法：
    一、药剂除治：（一）砒酸铅及砒酸钙：每十斤清水中放砒酸铅或砒酸钙二两，搅拌均匀后，喷射在被害的白菜上，每亩用量看蔬菜的大小而定，大约四至八斤。
    （二）滴滴涕：含百分之二的滴滴涕粉剂，或者用高浓度的乳剂。与可湿性滴滴涕粉剂，稀释至百分之二的水液喷于被害蔬菜上，每亩用量视作物的大小以三至八斤为限。
    （三）苦树皮：为华北之土产杀虫植物，以其粉剂或液剂，撒或洒于被害蔬菜上，可以杀死猿叶虫。
    二、预防：在发生此虫最严重的田地栽培其他非十字花科蔬菜或作物，或者当收割时把黄叶废茎（萝＠最有效）等放在地上，这时此虫因食料骤减就都聚集在这些残弃物下，容易集中搜捉。
