　　Southern Hebei Calls for Protecting Wheat
  　Western Hebei Rushes to Sow Large Fields
    [Jinan Telegram] In view of the fact that during last summer's wheat harvest season, incidents of special agents burning wheat and robbing wheat occurred in various places, the People's Armed Forces Department of the Southern Hebei District Party Committee, in order to protect the wheat harvest, stabilize the order of the wheat harvest, and eliminate theft and arson, has instructed all localities to prepare early and complete the task of protecting the wheat harvest with a high degree of vigilance. The following specific points were made: 1. Mobilize cadres at all levels to attach importance to this work, especially village-level cadres, to lead the militia self-defense forces in production and to protect the wheat harvest. It should also be explained that although the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been declared extinct, its revenge and resistance against the people will not stop because of this. On the contrary, it will intensify its sabotage in various hidden ways. Any 麻庳and neglect of this situation and situation will cause undue losses to our work. 2. It is necessary to educate cadres to overcome the bad practices of coercion, commandism, substitution, or 包而不办, arouse the masses' conscious enthusiasm for eliminating traitors and preventing espionage, and protect production, and oppose any behavior that undermines production. 3. The key to protecting the wheat harvest and protecting production lies in "preventing problems before they occur." Once a sabotage incident occurs, it must be seriously investigated and strictly punished. Appropriate controls and compulsory labor should be implemented for suspected elements and loafers who are habitually thieves and do not engage in production. 4. In order to effectively prevent sabotage, summer defense headquarters should be established at all levels during the summer harvest. Establish joint defense between villages, taking small areas as units, and implement patrols and sentry duty. Educate the militia not to ask the masses for green grain or material rewards under any pretext. 5. Strict discipline and clear rewards and punishments must be enforced.
    [Zhangjiakou News] The plowing and sowing work in western Hebei has achieved great success. The sowing of cash crops has exceeded the target, and the plowing and sowing of arable land and large fields has been largely completed. Efforts are now being continued to rush the plowing and sowing work. As of May 14, according to statistics from Laishui, Wanping, Fangshan, Liangxiang four counties and Laishui and Zhuozhou seven districts: The original plan for cotton was more than 31,000 mu, and now more than 37,000 mu has been completed; the original plan for peanuts was more than 48,900 mu, and now more than 51,900 mu has been completed. More than half of the corn in Laishui has emerged. For example, in Pengtou Village, out of more than 2,900 mu of land, 1,800 mu have emerged. In Wanping, 147,200 mu of land has been plowed and sown 141,300 mu, that is, 95% of the plowing and sowing has been completed, and most of it has also emerged.
    In order to get through the famine early　Spring vegetables are grown in the large fields
    In some places, spring vegetables are grown in the large fields to get through the famine. For example, in the fifth district of Liangxiang, spring vegetables were grown in 14,500 mu of land. Seed soaking has been universally promoted in various counties, especially in Laishui, where the results are the greatest. County, district, and village cadres first experimented and then taught the masses. As a result, 80% of the seeds in the county were soaked. In Hedong Village, 90 out of 98 households soaked their seeds.
    The main reasons for the above achievements are the concentration of leadership, consistent steps, planned arrangement and inspection, and timely resolution and overcoming of problems and deviations. For example, when arranging the task of cash crops, there was a serious phenomenon of coercion and commandism in some places. The leadership corrected and criticized it in time after discovering it. In addition, the prefectural committee also successively dispatched two batches of cadres from various departments of the sub-district to the counties to supervise and guide, and the counties also organized work teams to drive the masses to carry out rush plowing and sowing, proposing "not to return until the task is completed." After the rain on May 11, the prefectural committee notified the counties by telephone overnight to concentrate their efforts to lead the masses to carry out rush work.

    [Zhangjiakou News] As of May 14, Fangshan District has completed the sowing of 12,343 mu of cotton and 18,057 mu of peanuts, exceeding the original allocation of 10,000 mu of cotton and 15,000 mu of peanut tasks. Now we are making every effort to rush the sowing of large field crops and begin to hoe seedlings. In Liyuan Store, Xiacun and other eleven villages, the large field crops sown in the wheat ridges in 15,352 mu of flooded and low-lying land have also all sprouted, and hoeing has begun. The wheat in more than 15,000 mu of paddy fields in the third district has begun to be hoeed for the second time.

　　冀南号召保护麦子
  　平西赶播大田
    【冀南电】冀南区党委人民武装部鉴于去夏麦收时期，各地均曾发生特务烧　麦、抢麦等破坏生产的现象；今年麦收将到，为了保卫麦收，安定麦收秩序，杜绝偷窃、焚烧等现象，特指示各地早作准备，以高度的警惕来完成保卫麦收任务。并具体提出：一、动员各级干部，切实重视这一工作，尤其是各村级干部，要领导民兵自卫队，进行生产，保卫麦收。并说明国民党反动统治，虽已宣告灭亡，但其对人民的报复与反抗，并不会因此停止，相反的更会以种种隐蔽的方式，加紧破坏，对这种情况与形势，如有任何麻庳与忽视，都将会使我们的工作遭到不应有的损失。二、要教育干部克服强迫命令、代替包办或包而不办的坏作风，发动群众自觉的除奸防谍，保卫生产的热情，反动破坏生产的任何行为。三、保卫麦收，保卫生产的重点，在于“防患未然”。如破坏事件一旦发生，则必须认真破案与严格制裁。并对嫌疑分子和偷盗成性、不事生产的二流子实行适当管制，强制劳动。四、为有效的防范破坏，夏收期间，应建立各级夏防指挥部。以小区为单位，建立村与村的联防，实行会哨、巡逻。教育民兵，不应用任何借口向群众要看青粮，或物质报酬。五、要严格纪律、明确奖惩。
    【察哈尔讯】平西耕地播种工作，获得了很大成绩。经济作物播种超过任务，耕地、大田播种大部完成。现正继续突击耕播工作。截至五月十四日止，据涞水、宛平、房山、良乡四县及涞涿七个区的统计：棉花原计划三万一千余亩，现完成三万七千余亩；花生原计划四万八千九百余亩，现完成五万一千九百余亩。涞水半数以上的玉米已出苗，如蓬头村二千九百余亩土地，已有一千八百亩出苗；宛平十四万七千二百亩地，已耕播十四万一千三百余亩，即完成耕播达百分之九十五强，大部亦已出苗。
    为了渡荒早接嘴　大田里面带春菜
    有些地方为了渡荒在大田里面带种春菜。如良乡五区有一万四千五百亩地中带种了春菜。各县浸种都作了普遍提倡，尤以涞水成绩最大，县区村干部先作实验，然后教给群众，结果全县百分之八十的种籽都浸过。河东村九十八户浸种的就有九十户。
    获得上述成绩的主要原因，是领导力量集中，步调一致，有计划有布置有检查，发现问题、偏向，及时解决、克服。如布置经济作物任务时，有些地方存在着严重的强迫命令现象，领导发现后及时作了修正与批判。此外地委还接连从分区各部门抽出两批干部分赴各县督导，各县亦组织工作组带动群众进行突击耕播，提出“不完成任务不回来。”五月十一日下雨以后，地委连夜电话通知各县集中全力领导群众进行突击。（平西地委办公室）
    【察哈尔讯】房山各区到五月十四日止已完成了一万二千三百四十三亩的棉花及一万八千零五十七亩的花生播种，超过原分配一万亩棉花及一万五千亩花生任务。现正全力突击大田作物播种并开始锄头遍苗。黎园店、夏村等十一个村，一万五千三百五十二亩涝洼地，在麦垄里点种的大田作物，也全部见小苗，并开始锄头遍。三区一万五千余水地麦子，开始锄二遍。
