The North China Government Continues Tax Policy Symposium
　　Soliciting Opinions from Industry and Commerce

　　[This newspaper reported] The Finance Department of the North China People's Government has been inviting people from all walks of life for several days to discuss and widely listen to opinions on tax policy issues before and after the liberation. The participation of democratic figures in the symposium on the previous (17th) has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, representatives of industry and commerce were invited to continue the symposium. Those present included Mr. Zhang Jiǒngbó, representatives from the Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, Trade Association, Coal Depot Association, Grain Depot Association, Cigarette Association, Rice and Grain Industry, Silk Industry, Flour Industry, Money Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Dahua Pottery Company, and others. Representatives from the Finance Department, Industry and Commerce Department, Finance Committee, Enterprise Department, Municipal Government Research Office, and other agencies, as well as the heads of the provincial, municipal, and district bureaus under the North China Taxation Bureau, totaled more than 80 people. First, Wu Bo, Deputy Minister of Finance, explained the purpose of holding the symposium, and then called on the representatives to speak freely and express their opinions on the People's Government's handling of tax policy issues, whether past or future, whether right or wrong. Subsequently, Director Li of the North China Taxation Bureau spoke, elaborating on the principles for drafting tax laws. Then, the representatives present spoke one after another. In their speeches, everyone unanimously believed that the People's Government demonstrates a democratic spirit in handling any issue, and the opinions of taxpayers should be heard on tax matters. The representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce pointed out, "In the past, the types and rates of taxes were determined by the government, and compliance was mandatory. If you couldn't pay, you still had to pay. Where was there an opportunity for the people to speak!" Mr. Chen Yintang of Dahua Pottery Company said with emotion: "The Kuomintang was a spendthrift. In the past, I also had doubts about the Communist Party. But after meeting them, I realized that our dilapidated family has produced descendants who are bringing boundless bright prospects to China. I just heard the representatives raise many opinions on taxation. Unfortunately, I am a layman, but I only hope that the government will make the tax law clear, one is one, two is two, and simplify the collection procedures."

　　The representatives present expressed many suggestions on salary and wage income tax, stamp tax, small business license tax, temporary business tax, merchant tax, commodity tax, export tax, administrative and operational fees, fur tax, etc., verbally and in writing. Mr. Zhang also excitedly said during the break: "This is really a good method. Taxpayers and tax collectors brainstorm together. Only the People's Government would do this kind of democratic approach, and only the People's Government dares to do it. Today's symposium fully demonstrates that the government is of the people."

　　The symposium ended at 4:30 p.m., and it is heard that a symposium will also be held in Tianjin in the coming days.

    【本报讯】华北人民政府财政部连日邀请各界人士座谈，广泛听取对解放前后税政问题的意见。前（十七）日民主人士出席座谈，各情已志本报，昨日续约工商业界代表座谈，到会有张ｊｉǒｎｇ＠①伯先生、北平市商会、银行公会、贸易公会、煤栈公会、粮栈公会、纸烟公会、米类粮业、绸缎业、面粉业、钱业、药业、大华窑业公司等代表，财政部、工商部、财委会、企业部、市府研究室等机关代表，以及华北税务总局所辖各省市区局局长等共八十余人。首由财政部吴波副部长说明召开座谈会的目的后，号召到会代表本知无不言言无不尽精神，对人民政府在税政问题的处理上，不论是过去的或未来的，不论对与不对，多多发表意见。继由华北税务总局李局长发言，阐明拟订税法的原则之后，到会的各代表，即相继发言，在发言中大家一致认为人民政府在处理任何一个问题上，都是发挥民主精神的，纳税的事要听取纳税义务人的意见。市商会的代表指出“税种税率在过去都是政府订出数目，强制遵行，纳不了也要纳，哪里有人民说话的机会”！大华窑业公司陈荫棠先生感慨的说：“国民党是个败家子，我过去对共产党也曾抱着怀疑心理，等到见面以后，才发现我们这个破落家庭，出了复兴的子弟，给中国带来无限光明的前途。刚才我听到各代表对税收提了很多意见，可惜我是个门外汉，仅希望政府订税法要明确，一是一，二是二，并使征收手续简便。”
    到会各代表对薪给工资所得税、印花税、小商牌照税、临时营业税、行商税、货物税、出口税、行政事业费、皮毛税等，用口头及书面发表了许多建议性的意见，张＠伯先生在休息时他也兴奋的说：“这真是好办法，纳税人和征税人一块出主意，这种民主作风只有人民政府才会这样做，也只有人民政府才敢于这样做，今天的座谈完全表现了政府是人民的。”
    座谈会进行到下午四时半结束，并闻日内将在津亦举行座谈。
