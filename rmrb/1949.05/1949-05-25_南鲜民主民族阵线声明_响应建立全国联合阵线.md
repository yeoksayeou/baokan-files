　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: Pyongyang dispatch. The local newspapers published a statement from the Central Committee of the South Korean Democratic National Front, which pointed out that the political parties joining the South Korean Democratic National Front supported the proposal to establish an all-Korean national democratic united front, a proposal that is highly adapted to the current political situation in Korea. The statement also said: Our people are united, we have one motherland, and the Soviet Union, based on the principle of respecting the freedom and equality of other countries, withdrew its troops from the northern part of the Republic six months ago, thus giving us the right to decide our own destiny. However, American imperialism still maintains its troops on our territory and supports a bloody military police system, with the aim of turning our motherland into their colony. The American colonial policy and the criminal activities of its running dogs, such as the traitor Syngman Rhee, have aroused the anger and resistance of the South Korean people. All patriotic political parties and mass organizations have launched a struggle to demand the withdrawal of American troops and the restoration of national unification. Based on this political situation, the establishment of a broad and solid all-Korean national democratic united front has become an urgent task for the political parties and mass organizations joining the South Korean Democratic National Front, a united front that will guarantee the full realization of a free, democratic, and independent country. The South Korean Democratic National Front supports the proposal of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic National United Front to establish a preparatory committee for the all-Korean national democratic united front. The South Korean Democratic National Front has approved the representatives of the various parties to participate in the preparatory committee, and the first meeting of the preparatory committee will be held on May 25.
