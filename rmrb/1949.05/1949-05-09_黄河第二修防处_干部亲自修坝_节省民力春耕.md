    Cadres Personally Repair Dams to Save Civilian Labor for Spring Plowing
    [Ji Lu Yu Electric Dispatch] In order to save civilian labor and facilitate agricultural production, cadres of the Yellow River Second Repair and Prevention Office's Gao Village Engineering Team personally repaired dams, greatly improving work efficiency. Last year, the Gao Village dangerous section required the construction of nineteen new dams to withstand the fierce water erosion and prevent flooding. To ensure long-term safety, the engineering team re-surveyed and measured the area, deciding to demolish and rebuild eight dams, including No. 17, which did not meet the required standards. These eight dams required 1,300 workdays; however, as it is currently the planting season, the engineering team decided to bear the entire burden themselves to take care of the masses' production and reduce conscription. After mobilization, they organized two teams of twenty people each. The entire project is expected to be completed in one month, with a piece-rate system implemented and daily work inspections. The team members are highly motivated, and the two captains and vice-captains, who are in their fifties and sixties, are participating in the work. Dam No. 17 was completed in eight days amidst everyone's enthusiastic atmosphere.

    黄河第二修防处
    干部亲自修坝  节省民力春耕
    【冀鲁豫电】为节省民力，便利农业生产，黄河第二修防处高村工程队干部亲自动手修坝，工作效率大大提高。高村险工，去年为抵挡当时猛水冲刷，免使洪水犯滥，曾先后修筑新坝十九道。为使长期得到保险，工程队又重新勘察测量，决定将不合规定尺度之十七号等八坝拆毁重修。该八坝需工一千三百个；惟目前正值耕种时间，为照顾群众生产，减少支差，工程队决定全部自己负担。经动员后，以二十人为一分队，共组织了两队。全部工程预计一月完成，并实行分工的计工制，逐日检查工作。队员们情绪都很高涨，五六十岁的两位正副队长都参加工作。十七号坝便在大家兴奋的情绪中，以八天的时间完成了。
