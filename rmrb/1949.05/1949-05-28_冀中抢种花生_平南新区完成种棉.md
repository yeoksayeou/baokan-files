[Jizhong Electric] Jizhong is rushing to plant crops across the board, with particular emphasis on completing the peanut planting plan. To address the shortage of peanut seeds, the Ninth Administrative Region mobilized 500,000 catties of local grain to purchase peanuts and loan them to the masses. Dingxian and Anxin counties have promoted this initiative, purchasing 130,000 catties of peanut seeds after the rain and are in the process of transporting and distributing them. Qingyuan also plans to increase peanut planting by 650 mu in 21 villages that have the conditions but lack the habit of growing them. The county has three methods for solving the peanut seed shortage: (1) Village cadres conduct surveys of planting households, and then mobilize households with peanut reserves through respected veteran farmers, exchanging grain for peanuts at market prices. Every shi of black beans can be exchanged for 100 catties of peanuts. On the 22nd, 200 households in Niuzhuang in the Second District exchanged 1,100 catties of peanuts in one day. (2) Launch mutual borrowing. (3) Send special personnel to purchase from other places, with travel expenses shared equally based on the number of peanut catties. This saves a lot of manpower. Donglu Village in the Third District converted the floating property of farmers who could not afford seeds into 80 shi of black beans, which were exchanged for peanut seeds. Now, farmers in various places have been mobilized intensively, working from dawn to dusk to rush plowing and planting.

[Jizhong Electric] After the rain, Party, government, military, and educational institutions in Jizhong dispatched a total of 4,018 people (the previous report of over 10,000 people included 6,000 troops) to dozens of villages near Baoshi to help farmers with crash planting. According to incomplete statistics, on the 23rd alone, over 600 mu of planting were completed, and over 1,000 mu were plowed, raked, and hoed, and the land was leveled, and 800 mu were weeded. In addition, there was manure collection, manure pounding, manure delivery, leveling large ditches, planting yams, etc. The cadres assisting in the work are actively helping farmers plant with extremely high labor enthusiasm. Comrades from the 35th team of the Party School, seeing that there were not enough hoes, used hoes to dig the ground. Some comrades persisted in working despite illness, and everyone constantly encouraged each other: don't be greedy, do a good job. When Secretary Cui Yazhi and Zuo Yongfang from the People's Armed Forces Department were planting yams for a family, they were afraid that the seedlings would be damaged by the heat, so they took off their jackets to cover them, their own skin burned bright red by the sun. The masses were so grateful that they didn't know what to do. Aunt Ji Changling said, "If you hadn't come, my land would have dried up and couldn't have been planted." The work team of the Twelfth Construction District, based on the situation, researched: (1) First plant the land with less rain and tight soil, then plant the land with more rain and soft soil. (2) In order to be drought-resistant, first rush to rake the land. (3) Mobilize men, women, old and young to go to the fields, children and the elderly do light work. (4) Organize mutual assistance between manpower and animal power, and advocate human-powered carts, rakes, and rollers, getting up early and going to bed late, "Planting one day early means harvesting ten days early."

[Jizhong News] The Pingnan Sub-district (Tenth Administrative Region) governs nine counties and one city (Shengfang). Most of it is the new district liberated after the Pingjin Campaign. This year's production is being carried out on the basis of preliminary resolution of land issues in more than one-third of the villages. The broad masses of working people are very active in production, especially the poor and hired peasants who have been allocated land. Regarding the planting of cash crops, from February 15th to the 14th of this month, cotton has been planted on more than 400,000 mu. Because some people in the new district have ideological concerns, some areas have underreported the area planted. If the statistics are accurate, the task of planting 400,000 mu of cotton has basically been completed. The exemplary actions of Party members and cadres in sowing have played a great role in promoting production. However, serious phenomena of coercion and commandism have occurred in some areas, wasting manpower, affecting production, and even causing dissatisfaction among the masses. For example, in Nanzhaozhuang, Guan, due to compulsory mass labor, some people reflected, "Mass labor, dawdling, three hours for a poop and pee." In one village in Baxian, due to the implementation of mass labor, some said, "Put the cotton seeds down, wipe them with your foot, whether they come up or not depends on them." This is mainly due to the cadres' eagerness for quick results and a purely task-oriented view. The prefectural committee has made a self-criticism and instructed all counties to correct this.

### 冀中抢种花生　平南新区完成种棉

　　冀中抢种花生
  　平南新区完成种棉
    【冀中电】冀中全面抢种中，特别强调完成种植花生计划，为了解决花生种籽的缺乏，九专区动用地方粮五十万斤，购买花生贷给群众，定县和安新两县推进社，雨后已购买花生种籽十三万斤，正转运贷放。清苑并计划在有条件而没习惯的二十一个村增种花生六百五十亩。该县对解决花生种籽的缺乏，有三种办法：（一）村干按照种户调查数字，然后通过有威信的老农向存花生户进行动员，根据市价，以粮抵换。每市石黑豆，换花生一百斤。二区牛庄二十二日一天就有二百户交换了花生一千一百斤。（二）发动互借。（三）派专人到外处购买，盘费按花生斤数均摊。节省许多人力。三区东闾村对无力购买种籽的农民把浮财折变了八十石黑豆，换成花生种籽。现在各地农民已紧张动员起来，早起晚睡的抢耕抢种。
    【冀中电】落雨后冀中党政军学各机关团体，共派出了四千零一十八人（前次报导一万多人，其中包括部队六千人）到保市附近的数十个村庄，帮助农民突击播种。据不完全的统计，仅二十三号一天，已完成播种六百余亩，耕耙和镐地平地共一千余亩，锄地八百余亩。另外还有起粪、捣粪、送粪、平大沟、栽山药等等，助耕干部人员，都是以极高的劳动热情积极助农播种。党校三十五队的同志们，见耠子不够用，就用镐镐地。有些同志，带病坚持作活，大家还不断互助勉励：别贪多，要做好。人民武装部秘书崔亚志和左永芳同志，给一家栽山药时，怕天热把秧子晒坏了，就脱下褂子盖上，把自己的肉皮晒得鲜红。群众感激得不知怎么着好了，纪长领娘说：“若不是你们来，我这地干了也种不上。”建国十二区的工作组，并根据情况研究出：（一）先耩雨小的和性紧的地，后耩雨大的和柔和的地。（二）为了耐旱，先突击耙地。（三）发动男女老少下地，儿童和老年做轻活。（四）人畜力拨工互助，提倡人力拉车、拉耙、拉碾子，早起晚睡，“早种一日早收十日”。
    【冀中讯】平南分区（十专区）辖九个县一个市（胜芳），大部为平津战役后解放的新区，今年的生产，是在三分之一以上的村庄内初步解决了土地问题的基础上进行的，广大劳动人民生产都很积极，特别是分得土地的贫雇农民，关于经济作物种植，自二月十五日开始，至本月十四日止，种植棉花已达四十余万亩，因新区群众有的思想有顾虑，部分地区有种多报少的现象。如精确统计基本上已完成了四十万亩种棉花的任务。播种中党员干部的模范行动带动群众，在生产上起了很大作用。但部分地区却发生了严重的强迫命令现象，浪费了民力，影响了生产，甚致引起群众不满。如固安南赵庄因强迫大拨工，有的群众反映说：“大拨工，磨洋工，拉屎尿泡（大小便）三点钟。”霸县一个村因实行了大拨工，有的说“棉子一放，拿脚一擦，出不出在它”这主要是干部急于求成和单纯任务观点所致，地委已作了检讨，并指示各县进行纠正。
