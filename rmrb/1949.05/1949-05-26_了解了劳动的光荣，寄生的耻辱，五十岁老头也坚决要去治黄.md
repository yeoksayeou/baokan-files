　　[This Newspaper News] The Beiping Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau took in more than 370 beggars and thieves in early May. Apart from sending the old, weak, and disabled to relief homes, and those with families back home, the remaining 130 people were formed into a labor brigade and departed last night to participate in the Yellow River construction project. Initially, the beggars and thieves who were taken in had many concerns and were panicked: the beggars were afraid of going hungry (during the Kuomintang rule, beggars were caught and not given enough to eat), and the thieves were afraid of being sent to prison by the Public Security Bureau. A few who volunteered were unwilling to be with the thieves, and their emotions were also not good. However, after distributing clothes and shoes, and ensuring they had enough to eat, the facts finally educated them, and they slowly settled down. Later, after explaining the glory of self-reliance and labor production, and the shame of parasitism, after more than 20 days, most of the thieves and beggars became aware and were willing to participate in production. A thief named Liu Fengquan expressed to everyone with deep emotion that he would start anew and strive to complete three months of work in two months (originally scheduled to work for three months in the Yellow River engineering team). Not only do three months of work, but also five months are willing. A fifty-year-old man named Zhao Wenge, because of his age, was not allowed to repair the Yellow River, he repeatedly requested to go. He said: "If you don't let me go, I have to go. Labor is sacred, everyone must have a job. Soldiers are bleeding in the front, and we must sweat in the rear, increase production, and support the front. Not only will we turn over, but every poor person in the country will also turn over." Wang Yongshun and Li Xiying, who had been in the relief home for more than ten years, also automatically joined the labor brigade. Wang Yongshun, who is over fifty years old, raised his fist and said to the reporter: "Don't look at my old age, I have a lot of strength. How much strength one has, one should use that much strength. Only by working can one have food to eat, and only then can one eat."

　　了解了劳动的光荣，寄生的耻辱，五十岁老头也坚决要去治黄
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府民政局曾在五月初收容了乞丐小偷三百七十余人。除将老弱残废的送救济院，有家者送其还家外，余下一百三十人，即组成劳动大队，已于昨晚出发参加建设黄河工程。最初被收容的乞丐小偷因为顾虑过多，恐慌不安：乞丐怕挨饿（国民党统治时抓来乞丐不让吃饱饭），小偷怕被公安局送入监狱。而少数自愿来的，又不愿意和小偷在一起，情绪也不好。但是，经过发衣服、发鞋、吃饭尽量管饱，事实终于教育了他们，慢慢安定下来。以后对他们讲解自食其力，劳动生产的光荣，寄生的耻辱，经过了二十多天，大部小偷乞丐都觉悟了，愿意参加生产。一个叫刘凤全的小偷向大家痛切表示，今后要重新作人，三个月的工作要争取两个月完成（预定参加黄河工程队做三个月工）。不只做三个月工，做五个月也愿意。一个五十岁叫赵文阁的，因为年老，不让他去修黄河，他三番五次请求要去。他说：“不叫去也得去，劳动神圣，人人要有工作。前方将士流血，我们在后方要流汗，增加生产，支援前线。不但我们翻身，全国每一个穷人也都要翻身”。在救济院已经过了十几年的王永顺和李锡英，也自动参加了劳动大队。五十多岁的王永顺举着拳头对记者说：“别看岁数大，有的是力气，一个人有多大力量要使多大力量，劳动才有饭吃，才能吃饭”。
