　　[Shijiazhuang Telegraph] Sun Changming, an old kiln worker at the Shijiazhuang Coke Plant, after more than ten months of painstaking research, and with the support and assistance of the plant, has finally successfully researched and developed a method of adding fire to the center of the cylinder kiln, saving coal and labor. Previously, fire was added from the side of the kiln, and it took seven and a half days to fire a kiln of cylinder bricks, consuming 5198 kilograms of coal and 291 man-hours. Now, it only takes three and a half days to fire a kiln of cylinder bricks, consuming 3566 kilograms of coal and 146 man-hours. After the internal modification of the cylinder brick kiln, each kiln can fire about 100 more bricks. This improvement of the cylinder brick kiln draws on the years of experience of the tile kiln, where fire is added in the middle of the kiln, so the firepower can reach all sides equally, and the firepower is greater than adding fire from the side. Sun Changming also added two flues to the kiln, and under the suction of the chimney, the firepower has a greater effect in the entire kiln. Sun Changming has always been active, responsible, and studious in his work. The plant has now awarded Sun Changming 200 jin of millet.

　　窑中间加火  省煤又省工
    【石家庄电】石家庄炼焦厂老窑工孙长明，经过十个多月的苦心钻研，并在厂方的支持和辅助下，终于研究成功了缸窑由窑中间加火，节省了煤和工。以前是从窑侧加火，烧一窑缸砖要用七天半时间，耗煤五千一百九十八公斤，费工时二百九十一个。现在烧一窑缸砖仅用三天半时间，耗煤三千五百六十六公斤，费工时一百四十六个。缸砖窑内部改造后，每窑能多烧一百来块砖。这次缸砖窑的改进是收了瓦窑上的多年经验，瓦窑是在窑中间加火，火力可以相同的到达各方，较侧面加火的火力大。孙长明又在窑内加了两个烟道，在烟囱的吸力下，使得火力在全窑中的作用更大。孙长明在工作上一贯积极负责和钻研。现厂方奖给孙长明两百斤小米。
