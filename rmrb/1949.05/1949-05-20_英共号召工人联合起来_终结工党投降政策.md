Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 18th: TASS, London: The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement summarizing the results of the local elections in England and Wales, pointing out that the increase in Conservative Party seats "is the price of the policies of Attlee, Bevin, Morrison, and Cripps. The Labour Party right-wing imposes burdens on the people and increases food prices in order to pay for rearmament and Churchill's foreign policy. The right-wing Labour Party protects the increasing profits of monopoly capital, while freezing workers' wages. The main offensive of the right-wing Labour Party is not against the Conservative Party, but against the Communist Party and the left wing. Their anti-communist espionage activities and purges, carried out amidst the cheers of the Conservative Party, have once again, as in the past, led to electoral defeat. The dangers of the first two Labour governments are in danger of being repeated. At that time, it was also MacDonald's right-wing policy of serving the interests of big monopoly capital and hostility towards the Communist Party and the Soviet Union that led to the electoral victory of the Conservative Party and the Conservative Party's long-term disastrous rule." The Communist Party calls on all workers to unite and end the Labour Party's right-wing policy of surrender.

　　英共号召工人联合起来
  　终结工党投降政策
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党执行委员会发表声明，总结英格兰和威尔士地方选举的结果，指出保守党席位的增加，“是艾德里、贝文、摩里逊和克利浦斯政策的代价。工党右翼把负担强加于人民并增加食物的价格，以便支付重整军备和邱吉尔外交政策的开支。右翼工党保护独占资本的日益增长的利润，而却冻结工人的工资。右翼工党的主要攻势，不是针对保守党，而是指向共产党与左派。他们在保守党的欢呼声中所进行的反共特务活动和清洗，已象过去一样，再度招致选举的失败。工党政府的前两次的危险，有再度重复之虞。那时，也是麦克唐纳的为大独占资本服务和仇视共产党与苏联的右翼政策，引起了保守党选举的胜利和保守党的长期的灾难性的统治。”共产党号召一切工人联合起来终结工党右翼的投降政策。
