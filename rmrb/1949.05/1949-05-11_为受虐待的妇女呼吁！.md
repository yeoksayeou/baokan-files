    A Call for Abused Women!
    Editor's Note: The phenomena reflected by comrades Zhenhai and Dingfang in Xingtai have also occurred in other counties, as reported by this newspaper more than once. This shows the deeply rooted nature of feudal remnants, which cannot be eradicated in a short time even in old liberated areas, and requires a long-term, patient, and in-depth work to complete this historical task. It is hoped that this issue can attract the attention of relevant parties so that women's work can be strengthened practically and effectively.

              Dear Editor: Recently, I have been assisting in work in the first and second districts of Xingtai. In several villages, I have discovered cases of women being oppressed, but there is no correct way to deal with these problems. In Dongjingsheng Village, First District, a woman named Heini, 21 years old, has been very active in her work since liberation and joined the Communist Party. During the land reform, the masses elected her as a representative of the village people's congress. After the meeting, upon returning home, she was slapped twice by her father-in-law as she entered the door and scolded severely. When the Party wanted to make the membership public during Party rectification, Heini, fearing more severe abuse from her father-in-law, tearfully begged the branch not to announce her name. At the time, the branch could not think of an appropriate solution and complied with Heini's request. Another military dependent woman in the village, who was also very active in her work, attended a meeting during Party rectification. While issues were being discussed, her father-in-law found the meeting place and scolded, forbidding the meeting to continue. On the spot, the district and village cadres did not say a word and told the woman to leave. Liu Fuling, a young woman from Zhucun Village, whose maiden family was from Cuiluzhuang Village in the Fifth District, married into the Yang Changzhong family in the village due to famine. Her husband was simple-minded. Liu Fuling served as the women's captain in the village and was very active in her work. Her father-in-law, Yang Changzhong, constantly insulted her and told the village branch secretary, Yang Xiuzhai, "I must discipline her when I have time!" Yang Xiuzhai explained to him many reasons why women should not be abused, but he still wouldn't listen. One evening, Fuling was a little late returning home after attending a meeting to conclude land reform. The next morning, Yang Changzhong and his son tied her up and used the iron strip from a cotton gin shaft to cut her face, smearing her face with oil and soot while shouting, "I'll give you a bruised face so you won't go to any more meetings..." Fuling screamed in pain, and only then did some people come to untie her. Afterward, the district sent her father-in-law to the county judicial section for handling. When Kang Meini from Wujiazhuang Village returned home after a meeting one evening, her mother-in-law refused to open the door and the next day asked Meini why she slept at a neighbor's house, scolding her severely. Similar incidents are numerous. We have carefully examined the reasons for these problems. The main reason is that habitual feudal ideas are difficult to eliminate completely in a short time. The idea that "women are useless" and "women should stay at home and do some work; it's inappropriate to go out to meetings" still exists among many people. Some cadres and Party members have not fully understood this ideologically, so they rarely educate the masses on this issue. When problems occur, there are few solutions. Some yield to feudal ideas, while others resort to administrative measures. The result of this is that some cases deepen the contradiction between women and their families, and some women have no choice but to endure humiliation and suffering, never finding a way out. Therefore, my active suggestion is: To liberate women's minds, in-depth education should be conducted among Party members and cadres, using the role women have played in land reform, Party rectification, production... to educate them. Newspapers should also publish more vivid materials that can demonstrate women's strength, and gradually promote this education to the masses. In short, this is a matter of changing customs and habits, which is not easy. Some people advocate that to fight against the old society, punitive measures must be taken, otherwise, bad habits will be difficult to change. I believe that administrative punishment can only be used for individual cases and is generally inappropriate. The solution to this problem is a major event in the current countryside, and I hope it can attract the attention of the newspaper and organize everyone to discuss a proper solution. It would be helpful if some places with practical experience in dealing with this issue could share their experiences.

### 为受虐待的妇女呼吁！

专栏：

    为受虐待的妇女呼吁！
    编者按：振海、丁芳同志反映邢台这些现象，在其他县份也曾同样发生，本报曾不只一次刊登过。这说明封建余孽的根深蒂固，虽在老解放区亦非短时所能根除，需要有较长期的耐心的深入工作，才能完成这一历史任务。这一问题，望能引起有关方面注意，使妇女工作能实际有效的更加强起来。
              编辑同志：最近我在邢台一二区帮助工作，在好几个村子里，发现妇女受欺压的事情，但对这些问题，但没有一个正确的处理办法。一区东井绳村妇女黑妮，二十一岁，解放以来，工作很积极，参加了共产党。土地改革时群众选她当村的人民代表会代表，会后回家，刚进门就被公公打了两个耳光，并臭骂一顿。整党党要公开，黑妮因怕受到公公更厉害的虐待，哭求支部不宣布她的名字。当时，支部想不出适当办法，就依黑妮的请求作了。该村另一军属妇女，对工作也很积极，整党时参加了会，正讨论问题时，她公公找到会场大骂不叫开会，当场，区村干部没啃一声，就叫这妇女走了。祝村青年妇女刘付令，娘家是五区崔路庄，因闹灾荒嫁给该村杨常中家，男人愚笨。刘付令在村任妇女队长，对工作很积极。她公公杨常中成天辱骂她，并向村支部书记杨修斋说：“我有空得制她！”杨修斋对他解释了很多不能虐待妇女的道理仍不听。一天晚上，付令为了开结束土改的会，回去晚了些，第二天早起，杨常中和他小子乃将她捆绑了，用弹花轴上的铁条将她脸划破，把油和黑烟涂了她满脸，一面还骂：“给你弄个乌青脸，叫你以后再开会……”当时，疼得付令大叫，才去了一些人把她解开。事后区里才将她公公送到县司法科去处理。五家庄康美妮晚上开完会回家时，婆婆不开门，第二天还问美妮为啥睡在隔邻家里，糊骂了一顿。类似以上的事情很多。我们曾仔细地考查了一下问题发生的原因，这当中主要还是习惯的封建思想难以一时清算净尽，“妇女不顶用”，“女人家在家做些活好，出去开会太不象话”的思想，还在许多人中间存在着，有些干部、党员，思想上也未完全弄通，因此平时很少在群众中教育，问题发生后，处理上很少办法，有的是向封建思想屈服，有的便不得不用行政办法，而这种做的结果，有的是更加深了妇女与家庭的矛盾，有的妇女则又不得不含辱忍苦，永也找不到出头的日子。因此，我的积极意见是：解放妇女的思想，应该在党员干部中进行深入的教育，用妇女在土改、整党、生产……中所发挥的作用来进行教育，报纸上也应该多发表一些能表现妇女力量的生动材料，并将这种教育逐步推广到群众中去。总之，这是一件移风改俗的事，是很不容易的。有人主张要向旧社会作斗争，必须采取惩办的办法，否则积习很难改变。我认为行政惩办的办法只能用于个别的事情上，一般采用，恐不妥当。这一问题的解决，在目前农村里是件大事，望能引起报纸的注意，并组织大家讨论个妥当办法才好，有些地方在处理这一问题上有实际经验的望能介绍。
