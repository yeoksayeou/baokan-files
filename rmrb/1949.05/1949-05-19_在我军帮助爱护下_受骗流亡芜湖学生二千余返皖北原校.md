Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 18th: With the help of the Wuhu Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army, over two thousand students from various middle schools in northern Anhui, who had been deceived and displaced to Wuhu by the Kuomintang, have returned to their original schools in northern Anhui to resume their studies from April 30th to May 8th. Some students have also joined the cadre school of one of our armies to study. The students and faculty members are deeply moved by the care shown to them by the People's Liberation Army. During the Huaihai Campaign, the Kuomintang bandit gang forced middle schools in northern Anhui to move south. Those who came to the Wuhu area included Qingyi Lin Middle School, Huaiyuan Middle School, Fuyang Women's Middle School, Bengbu Women's Middle School, Anhui Provincial First Public Vocational School, Fuyang Agricultural Vocational School, and Lingbi Normal School. After the students arrived here, they had no school buildings, no classes, no clothes, and not enough to eat, making their situation extremely difficult. When the People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River, the Kuomintang bandit gang fled in panic and tried to force these displaced students to move further south, but the vast majority of students and faculty members firmly refused. All the teachers and students of Lingbi Normal School, more than two hundred people, except for a very few who were forced to continue moving south, one hundred and ninety people detoured through small roads in Nanling County to avoid the bandit army and returned to the liberated city of Wuhu. When the Military Control Commission sent representatives to comfort all the displaced students, they were all moved to tears and expressed extreme indignation at the Kuomintang's deception and persecution. The Military Control Commission then issued travel expenses and introduced them to the Northern Anhui Administrative Office. Female students, family members of faculty, and individual patients were sent back to northern Anhui by the Shipping Administration Office. Lv Shiling, a senior high school student at Fuyang Women's Middle School, was hospitalized in the Yijishan Church Hospital due to illness. The Health Department of the Military Control Commission paid her medical expenses on her behalf and transferred her to a public hospital on May 8th for free treatment. Lv Shiling said with tears in her eyes: "I was deceived in the past and ran to Wuhu. If it weren't for the democratic government, I would have died here. The People's Liberation Army saved my life!"

　　在我军帮助爱护下
  　受骗流亡芜湖学生二千余返皖北原校
    【新华社芜湖十八日电】受国民党欺骗流亡在芜湖的皖北各中学学生，在人民解放军芜湖军管会的帮助下，自四月三十日至本月八日，已有二千余人回皖北原校就学。另有部分同学则已参加我某军干部学校学习。学生和教职员们对人民解放军对他们的爱护深为感动。淮海战役时，国民党匪帮强迫皖北各地中学南迁，来芜湖一带者，计有青弋临中、怀远中学、阜阳女中、蚌埠女中、省一公专、阜阳农职、灵璧师范等。学生们来此后无校址，无课上，无衣穿，吃不饱饭，困难已极。此次人民解放军胜利渡江，国民党匪帮仓皇逃命，又要强迫这批流亡学生向南迁移，当被绝大部分学生教职员所坚决拒绝。灵璧师范全体师生二百余人，其中除极少数被迫续向南迁外，有一百九十人从南陵县境绕道小路躲过匪军转回已经解放了的芜湖市。当军管会派代表前去慰问所有流亡学生时，他们都感动得哭起来，对国民党的欺骗迫害愤激已极。军管会当发给路费，并介绍他们赴皖北行署，对女同学及教职员家属和个别病员则由船舶管理处备船送回皖北，阜阳女中高中三年级女生吕世玲因病在弋矶山教会医院住院，军管会卫生部即代付医药费，并于本月八日将其转送至公立医院免费诊疗。吕世玲感动得流着眼泪说：“过去受骗了，跑到芜湖来，要不是民主政府，我就得死在这里，解放军救活了我呀！”
