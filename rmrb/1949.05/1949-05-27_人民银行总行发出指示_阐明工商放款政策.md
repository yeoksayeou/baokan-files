　　People's Bank of China Headquarters Issues Instructions
  　Clarifying Industrial and Commercial Lending Policies
    [This newspaper reports] The People's Bank of China headquarters issued an "Instruction on Industrial and Commercial Lending Policies" to its subordinate branches and offices in mid-May. This instruction emphasizes that the general policy of lending is to be conducive to the development of the national economy. It also points out that support for loans should adhere to the principle of prioritizing industry and agriculture over commerce, taking into account necessity and possibility, and distinguishing between importance and urgency. Under conditions equally beneficial to the national economy, state-owned industry must be given first priority, followed by private industry, and then handicrafts. If some city factories do not occupy a major position or do not require loans, the focus of work can be shifted to restoring handicrafts or specialized handicrafts for export, but possible conditions must be grasped. For example, if both public and private iron factories need loans, public should be prioritized over private, with more going to public and less to private. As another example, if both a public cigarette factory and a private iron factory need loans, the private iron factory should be given priority because it is more beneficial to the national economy. In terms of commercial lending, it should mainly be directed to import and export merchants and native product marketing businesses, as it is beneficial to the development of production. The instructions further point out that the amount standard for loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises can be determined based on the borrower's production nature, social credit, and capital situation. On the one hand, loans to private enterprises should help them restore and develop production, but more importantly, both public and private interests must be achieved.

　　人民银行总行发出指示
  　阐明工商放款政策
    【本报讯】中国人民银行总行于五月中旬向所属各分行、处发了一个“关于工商放款政策的指示”，这个指示着重说明放款的总方针是要有利于国民经济的发展。并指出：扶植贷款要本先工、农业，后商业的原则，要照顾必要与可能，要分出轻重缓急。在对国民经济同等有利的条件下，必须第一照顾国营工业，第二照顾私营工业，第三照顾手工业。如果有些城市工厂不占主要地位或不需要贷款，工作重心可放到恢复手工业或出口的特种手工业方面，但必须掌握可能的条件。例如：公营铁工厂与私营铁工厂都需贷款，就应该先公后私，公多私少。又例如：公营纸烟工厂与私营铁工厂都需要贷款，则应先贷给私营铁工厂，因为它对国民经济更有利益。在商业放款方面：主要应放到出入口商与土产运销事业，因为它对发展生产是有利的。指示中更指出：对私营工商业放款的数额标准可根据贷户的生产性质、社会信用及资金等情况而定。对私营企业一方面是帮助它恢复和发展生产，但更重要的是必须做到公私两利。
