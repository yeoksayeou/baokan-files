Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th. Fourteen outstanding leaders of the working class in Europe and America wrote articles for the "May Day" special issue of the Cominform's organ "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," expressing full confidence in the victory of the struggle for peace and socialism. The editorial reviewed the progress of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies and the divisions and chaos in the imperialist camp. After congratulating the Chinese People's Liberation Army on its victory, the editorial stated: The peace movement will become increasingly powerful, and the people of the world will surely stop the cannibalistic dreams of those who want to destroy mankind with atomic bombs. The editorial said: Arrogant people will be stopped sooner or later, and criminals will eventually be brought to justice. Great goals produce great strength, and this has been demonstrated in the people's struggle for peace. This year's "May Day" also demonstrates the working people's confidence in victory.
Moscow newspapers published editorials celebrating the great festival of "May Day," International Labor Day, and carried the victorious news of the Soviet people's early completion of Stalin's post-war five-year plan. The spring grain sowing plan in Ukraine has been completed by 101.1 percent, and the coal production of coal miners in the Outer Khingan Mountains has exceeded the level of coal production in 1950.
Bulgarian enterprises are now launching a competition to increase labor efficiency to welcome "May Day." Nationally renowned weavers Lilana, Limetrova, and Kirong, Tsvetanova, because they manage many looms at the same time, produce more than 20 percent of the quota every day. Construction workers Vlado, Germirkiv, and Morad, Dochinoff, because they have mastered the accelerated method of bricklaying, increased labor productivity by 3.5 times. The actions of these advanced workers have become a model for the broad masses of workers to learn from. In textile enterprises, 4,000 male and female workers have been involved in the competition movement.
Large-scale "May Day" demonstrations are being prepared throughout Italy. Vittorio, the secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor (who recently returned to Italy from Moscow after attending the 10th Soviet Trade Union Congress), will deliver a speech at a rally in Rome's Piazza del Popolo on the morning of May 1. The Christian Democratic government, fearing the growing power of the people, ordered the Rome police to ban the General Confederation of Labor from holding public demonstrations.
The Polish Department of the French General Confederation of Labor called on Poles living in Paris to participate in a grand commemoration on the 30th, and called on all Poles in France to participate in the "May Day" demonstration.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd. Tokyo News: 250,000 workers in Tokyo held a grand celebration of "May Day" Labor Day in the Imperial Palace Plaza on the 2nd, and then demonstrated and paraded through the streets of Tokyo. The workers participating in the conference held up various banners and flags, shouting slogans such as "Demand freedom, peace and independence" and "Down with the Yoshida Cabinet." When a vivid picture of a poisonous snake representing Yoshida strangling the workers appeared, the workers present applauded warmly. Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, addressed the workers in the square. He said: The Japanese people can see from the Chinese Liberation War that the democratic forces of the world are stronger than the reactionary forces. During the parade, Japanese Communist Party leaders Tokuda Kyuichi, Nosaka Sanzo, and other Japanese Communist Party members stood in front of the Japanese Diet Building. Every marching unit sang the Internationale as it passed in front of the Diet Building, and shouted slogans such as "Down with the Yoshida Cabinet." When the Japanese Communist Party leaders raised their hands to welcome the enthusiastic marching contingent, the latter immediately responded with thunderous applause.

    全世界人民充满胜利信心
    热烈纪念“五一”
    东京数十万工人示威反对吉田内阁
    【新华社北平三十日电】欧美十四位工人阶级杰出的领袖为各国共产党情报局机关刊物“争取持久和平与人民民主”“五一”节专号撰文，表示对争取和平与社会主义的斗争的胜利具有充分信心。该刊社论检讨苏联与人民民主国家的进步和帝国主义阵营中的分裂和混乱。社论向中国人民解放军的胜利致贺后，称：和平运动将越来越强大，全世界人民必将阻止要用原子弹毁灭人类的、吃人的梦想。社论说：狂妄的人迟早要被制止，罪犯终将受到审判。伟大的目标产生了伟大的力量，这已在争取和平的人民斗争中表现出来了。今年的“五一”节也表现着劳动人民对胜利的信心。
    莫斯科报纸发表庆祝“五一”国际劳动人民伟大节日的社论，并刊载苏联人民先期完成斯大林战后五年计划的胜利消息。乌克兰的春季谷物播种计划已完成百分之一百零一点一、外兴安岭采煤工人的煤产超过了一九五○年煤产的水平。
    保加利亚各企业现正展开增加劳动效率的竞赛，来迎接“五一”节。全国闻名的织工利拉纳、利米特洛瓦和基隆、茨维塔诺瓦，因为同时管理许多架织机，每天生产超过定额百分之二十的产品。建筑工人伏拉多、格米尔基夫和莫拉德、多钦诺夫，因为掌握了砌砖的加速方法，提高劳动生产率三点五倍。这种先进工人的行动，成为广大工人群众学习的模范。在纺织企业中，已有四千男女工人卷入竞赛运动中。
    全意大利“五一”节大示威正在准备中。意大利总工会书记维特里奥（新自莫斯科参加苏联第十届职工代表大会返意）将于五月一日早晨在罗马人民广场举行的大会上发表演说。基督教民主党政府恐惧日益增长的人民力量，命令罗马警察局禁止总工会举行公开示威。
    法国总工会波兰部号召住在巴黎的波兰人参加三十日举行的隆重纪念会，并号召法境全体波兰人参加“五一”大示威。
    【新华社北平二日电】东京消息：东京二十五万工人于二日在皇宫广场举行盛大的庆祝“五一”劳动节大会，会后并在东京大街上示威游行。参加大会工人群众高举各种标语牌与旗帜，高呼“要求自由，和平与独立”及“打倒吉田内阁”等口号。当一幅画着代表吉田的毒蛇正在绞杀工人的生动图画出现时，到会工人报以热烈的鼓掌。日共总书记德田球一向广场上的工人群众发表演说。他说：日本人民可以从中国解放战争中看到；全世界民主的力量超过反动派的力量。在大游行中，日共领袖德田球一、野坂参三及其他日共议员，都站在日本议会大厦的门前。每一游行单位在经过该大厦门前时，都高唱国际歌，并喊出“打倒吉田内阁”等口号。当日共领袖举手欢迎热烈的游行队伍时，后者立即报以如雷的掌声。
