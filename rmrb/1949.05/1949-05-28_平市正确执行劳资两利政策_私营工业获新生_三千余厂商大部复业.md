　　The correct implementation of Chairman Mao's policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit, developing production" has given new life to private industry in Beiping. According to preliminary statistics, among the 3,396 large and small factories (including 1,313 small flour mills and workshops) in 25 industries throughout the city, including private flour, matches, paper, rubber, machinery, metallurgy, chemical instruments, medical equipment, electrical materials, carpets, porcelain kilns, weaving and dyeing, knitting, soap making, and cigarettes, the vast majority have resumed production, with the exception of a very small number of special circumstances.
　　Before the liberation of Beiping, private factories suffered from the blows of imperialist commodities and the squeezing and oppression of domestic bureaucratic capital, resulting in shrinking production and difficult operations. Workers' lives were extremely hard, with many factory workers working more than 16 hours a day, some even up to 18 hours. Wages were unreasonable, and beatings and arbitrary dismissal of workers were common. After the liberation of Beiping, under the leadership of the preparatory committee of the Beiping Federation of Trade Unions, workers demanded reasonable wages and working hours, protection of workers' lives, and the abolition of various unreasonable oppressions. On the other hand, some factory owners, misled by enemy propaganda, did not understand the democratic government's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and feared worker liquidation and excessive wage demands. They often used various excuses to delay resumption of work, or sold and transferred raw materials and machinery, preparing to close down. In order to correctly resolve the various problems arising between labor and capital, working groups in various districts of the city went deep into the factories to conduct specific mediation. Based on the principle of "labor-capital mutual benefit, developing production," they reasonably protected the interests of workers, and at the same time corrected some workers' "leftist" tendencies, taking into account the reasonable profits of the capitalists. Workers' wages were adjusted based on the actual business conditions of each factory and the Labor Congress resolution that "the minimum wage, including the worker, must maintain the livelihood of two people." Working hours were generally set at ten hours, and could not exceed twelve hours at most. As labor-capital disputes were reasonably resolved, dozens of larger factories, such as match, flour, electrical machinery, carpet, printing, vegetable oil, and weaving and dyeing factories, resumed production one after another, and various unreasonable systems began to improve. In order to enable both labor and capital to better develop production, Li Lisan, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Peng Zhen and other responsible comrades of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, repeatedly invited worker representatives and factory owners to hold discussions, explaining the policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit, developing production." Workers recognized the consistency of developing production with the interests of the broad masses of people, and their important position in production, and began to show a new sense of ownership. Workers in some factories helped the factory owners overcome production difficulties in various ways. Capitalists began to dispel various doubts and prepared to develop production. For example, Xinhua Rubber Factory, Renli Carpet Factory, Cixing Iron Factory, China Hygiene Toothbrush Factory, and Jingwei Weaving and Dyeing Factory all increased capital, expanded production, formulated reasonable wages, took care of workers' welfare, and absorbed workers into factory management. Some even established factory management committees. Workers' enthusiasm for production has increased significantly. For the specific difficulties of some factories, the People's Government has systematically supplied raw materials, purchased or promoted finished products, and implemented loans to help them in various ways. Among the weaving and dyeing industries, 234 weaving factories were able to put 170 power looms and 1,500 manual looms into production because the National Trading Company supplied raw materials and purchased finished products. In the machinery and iron industry, the Trading Company supplied 200,000 catties of pig iron and the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency ordered a large number of waterwheels, making the industry shift from a state of stagnation to activity. More than 600 large and small flour mills and 170 knitting factories were able to resume work and develop production because they received similar assistance. In addition, the purchase of matches, soap, stationery, etc. solved the problem of sales difficulties for some factories. The National Bank has provided appropriate loans to some private factories that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Up to now, the Communications Bank, Cooperative Bank, China Bank and other three banks have lent a total of more than 34.5 million yuan to kiln industry, leather making, pharmaceutical, wire, matches, carpet exporters, and production cooperatives organized by small producers. Due to the above measures, the production of various private industries has been gradually increasing. For example, the match industry produced 1,508 boxes in April, an increase of 308 boxes compared to March; the paper industry produced 6,387 reams in April, an increase of 231 reams compared to March; the flour industry produced 128,988 bags in April, an increase of 6,735 bags compared to March. Other industries, such as rubber, glass instruments, enamel, and porcelain, are also striving to increase production because production cannot meet demand.

　　平市正确执行劳资两利政策
    私营工业获新生
  　三千余厂商大部复业
    【本报讯】毛主席所规定的“劳资两利、发展生产”的政策，使北平私营工业获得新生。据初步统计，全市私营面粉、火柴、造纸、橡胶、机器、冶金、化学仪器、医疗器械、电料、地毯、瓷窑、织染、针织、造胰、卷烟等二十五行业共三千三百九十六家大小工厂中（其中包括小型面粉厂及作坊一三一三家）除极少数特殊情形外，绝大部分已经恢复生产。
    平市解放前，私营工厂受帝国主义商品的打击与国内官僚资本的排挤压榨，生产萎缩，经营困难，工人生活极苦，很多工厂的工人做工在十六小时以上，有的甚至到十八小时，工资不合理，打骂与随便开除工人更是普遍现象。北平解放后，在平市总工会筹委会的领导下，工人要求合理规定工资、工时，保障工人生活与废除各种无理压迫。另方面，由于某些厂主误听敌人宣传，不了解民主政府保护与发展工商业的政策，害怕工人清算与要求过高工资，常以各种借口迟不复工，或变卖、转移原料、机器，准备关门。为使劳资双方所发生的各种问题得到正确解决，市内各区工作组深入各工厂具体进行调解，根据“劳资两利、发展生产”的原则，合理保护工人利益，同时纠正了某些工人的过左偏向；照顾到资方的合理利润。工人工资则根据各厂实际营业情况与劳大决议“最低连本人在内要维持两个人的生活”的原则，进行了调整，工时一般规定为十小时，最多不得超过十二小时。由于劳资纠纷获得合理解决，火柴、面粉、电机、地毯、印刷、植物油、织染等数十个较大工厂先后复工生产，各种不合理的制度开始改善。为使劳资双方更好的发展生产，全国总工会副主席李立三，中共北平市委彭真等负责同志及市总工会与工商局，曾多次邀请工人代表及各厂主举行座谈，解释“劳资两利、发展生产”的政策，工人认识到发展生产与广大人民利益的一致性，及自己在生产中的重要地位，开始表现着一种新的主人翁姿态，有些厂的工人曾多方帮助厂方克服生产困难。在资方则开始解除种种疑虑，准备发展生产，如新华橡胶厂、仁立地毯厂、慈型铁工厂、中国卫生牙刷厂、经纬织染厂等，均增加资金，扩大生产，制定合理工资，照顾工人福利，并吸收工人参加工厂管理，有些并成立了工厂管理委员会。工人生产积极性显著提高。对某些工厂的具体困难，人民政府曾有计划地供给原料，收购或推销成品，并实行贷款，从各方面予以帮助。织染业中曾有二百三十四家织布厂，由于国家贸易公司供给原料和收购成品，使一百七十台电力机，一千五百台人力机开动生产。机器铁工业中曾由贸易公司供给二十万斤生铁及水利推进社订制大批水车，使该业由停顿状态趋于活跃。有大小六百余家面粉厂，一百七十家针织厂均因得到类似此种扶助而得以复工和发展生产。此外如收购火柴、肥皂、文具等，使若干工厂解决了销路困难的问题。国家银行对于某些有益于国民生计的私营工厂曾给予适度的贷款，截至目前止，总计交通、合作、中国等三银行曾贷给窑业、制革、制药、电线、火柴、地毯出口商及由小本生产者组织的生产合作社等共三千四百五十余万元。由于以上措施，私营各业的生产已在逐渐提高，如火柴业，四月份出产一五○八箱，较三月份增加三○八箱；造纸业四月份出产六三八七令，较三月份增加二三一令；面粉业四月份出产一二八九八八袋，较三月份增加六七三五袋。其他如橡胶、玻璃仪器、搪瓷、瓷器等业，由于生产供不应求，亦在力谋增加生产。
