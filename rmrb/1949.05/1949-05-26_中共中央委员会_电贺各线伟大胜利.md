To Comrades Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, and Zhao Shoushan of the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrades Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrades Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all commanders and fighters of the field armies, and Comrades of the People's Liberation Army in the southern guerrilla areas:

Since our various People's Liberation Army units liberated Nanjing and Taiyuan and other places in late April, they have continued to advance victoriously. On May 3rd, our Third Field Army liberated Hangzhou. On May 16th and 17th, our Fourth Field Army liberated Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang. On May 20th, our First Field Army liberated Xi'an. On May 17th and 22nd, our Second Field Army liberated Jiujiang and Nanchang. Currently, our army has liberated most of Jiangsu, most of Zhejiang, all of Anhui, part of Fujian, part of Jiangxi, most of Hubei, and most of Shaanxi. Guerrilla warfare in the provinces of Hainan Island, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi has also achieved new victories. Wherever our army goes, the enemy troops collapse at the mere sight of us, the people erupt in thunderous cheers, urban production is rapidly restored, teachers and students quickly resume classes, and the relationship between the military and the people is harmonious and seamless. All of this is the result of the concerted efforts of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts, the people's guerrilla forces, local Communist Party members, workers, students, democratic figures from all walks of life, and patriotic compatriots. A telegram is hereby sent to celebrate these achievements. It is hoped that the military and civilians at the front and rear will continue to work hard and strive to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and liberate all the Chinese people.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
