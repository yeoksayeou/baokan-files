Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 2nd. The Harbin Railway Workers' General Union's subordinate unions have implemented the method of "everyone runs the union," making union work a truly mass activity, full of vigor. In mid-February, after the representatives attending the Northeast Labor Bureau's labor insurance conference returned to Harbin, they conveyed Comrade Li Lisan's introduction of the Soviet Union's experience in everyone running the union. The Harbin Railway Workers' General Union immediately absorbed and promoted it, and it has achieved great results. Everyone running the union means absorbing all union members to do union work, so that every member holds a certain position in the union. In the union group, there are generally positions such as group leader, organization officer, production officer, propaganda officer, communications officer, and labor insurance officer, and each member holds a position. For groups with a large number of people, vice group leaders, technical, merit-recording, mutual assistance, health, family, cultural and entertainment, and food officers can also be added as appropriate. When everyone works together and coordinates with each other in this way, the work of the group will be sound. The members of the union committees at all levels can also find members in the group who are related to their own division of labor to jointly arrange work, which is convenient for promoting work from top to bottom and for reflecting the situation from bottom to top. This overcomes the phenomenon of union committee members "doing everything, but doing nothing well" in the past. Since the implementation of this method, the Harbin Railway Workers' General Union and its subordinate unions have solved many practical problems in production, union work, and life. For example, Tian Fulong, a construction worker in the Jixi Engineering Section, has better skills. After being selected as the group's technical officer, he actively helped others improve their skills. Therefore, on the recommendation of the union to the administrative leaders, he has been promoted to foreman. Thanks to the promotion of the production officer of the Jiamusi Inspection Section, everyone changed the long-standing habit of arriving late and leaving early. In the Heitai work area group of the Jixi Engineering Section, after work, the labor insurance officer registered materials door-to-door, the health officer also promoted non-members to sweep the floor together, the cultural officer wrote wall newspapers to commend them, and the study officer organized members and non-members who were illiterate to learn to read at night. In this way, union work is made vigorous, and everyone becomes more and more energetic as they work. After the broad masses of workers felt that the union was truly their own, their concern for the union greatly increased. Lin Dongming, the health officer of the Eighth District Station group in Harbin City, is already over sixty years old this year. He still goes to the staff and workers' union every day after work to ask: "Does the union have anything to do today?"

### “大家办工会”越办越有劲  哈尔滨铁路工会生气勃勃

    “大家办工会”越办越有劲
    哈尔滨铁路工会生气勃勃
    【新华社哈尔滨二日电】哈尔滨铁路职工总会所属各工会实行“大家办工会”办法，使工会工作真正成为群众性活动，生气勃勃。二月中旬，出席东北劳动总局劳动保险会议的代表回哈后，传达了李立三同志介绍的苏联职工会大家办工会的经验，哈尔滨铁路职工总会即行吸收推广，收到了很大的成效。大家办工会就是吸收全体工会会员来做工会工作，使每一个会员在会里都担任一定的职务。在工会小组中，一般设小组长、组织干事、生产干事、宣传干事、通讯干事、劳动保险干事等职务，每一个组员都担任一项职务。人数较多的小组，还可斟酌情况增设副组长、技术、记功、互助、卫生、家属、文化娱乐、伙食等干事。如此一齐动手，互相配合，小组工作就会健全起来。各级工会委员会的委员也可分别找小组中与本身分工有关的组员共同布置工作，既便于自上而下推动工作，又便于自下而上反映情况。这就克服了过去工会委员“什么事都办，什么事也办不好”的现象。实行这个办法后，哈尔滨铁路职工总会所属各工会解决了很多生产上、工会工作上及生活上的实际问题。如鸡西工务段建筑工人田福隆技术较好，被选为小组技术干事后便积极帮助其他的人提高技术，因此经工会向行政领导建议，已被提升为工长。佳木斯检车段由于小组生产干事的推动，全体改变了迟到早退的积习。鸡西工务段黑台工区小组在下班后劳动保险干事就逐户登记材料，卫生干事也推动非会员一道扫地，文化干事则写墙报表扬他们，学习干事在晚上组织会员与非会员中的文盲学习识字。这样，把工会工作弄得生气勃勃，大家越干越有劲。广大工人在感到工会真正是自己的以后，对工会的关心大大增加。哈市八区车站小组的卫生干事林东明，今年已经六十多岁了，每天下班后还必定到职工会问问：“今天工会可有事情？”
