    Cang County's Dalangdian
    Draining Water to Plant Hemp
    [Jizhong Electric] In Nantujing Village, Cang County, there is a large depression called Qianqing Wu (Thousand Acres of Stagnant Water) in Dalangdian, which is formed by the accumulation of rainwater every year. It is twenty li east to west and twelve li north to south, covering a total area of 129,600 mu. Last year, the breach of the Southern Grand Canal flooded into the depression, with the deepest part reaching over one zhang. In order to drain the accumulated water and expand the cultivated land area, the county government mobilized civilian laborers in November last year to open a diversion canal, twelve li long and two zhang wide, from the depression to the Shibei River to drain the water. Due to the slow water flow in winter, the water was not completely drained. In early March this year, it still occupied twelve li east to west and eight li north to south, with a water depth of about one and a half chi. In order not to hinder spring plowing, the county government again mobilized 1,200 people on March 7th to dredge the canal, which was completed in just one day. By April 8th, the water depth was only five cun, occupying only 200 mu. According to local farmers, hemp can be planted even with water. In addition, south of Licai Gao Village in Dongguan District, there is a stagnant pool (wu) that was also flooded by the breach of the Grand Canal last year. The accumulated water occupied 2,000 mu, and the surrounding land was mostly damaged by the immersion. The government mobilized 400 civilian laborers on March 29th to dig ditches to drain the water into the Shibei River. By April 8th, the water had been completely drained, and all of it could be planted. After the completion of the water drainage work in the two stagnant pools, the cultivated land area was expanded by a total of 131,600 mu. The land is moist and fertile, and the masses are happily busy planting.

    沧县大浪淀
    泄水种麻
    【冀中电】沧县南土井村有一大浪淀名千顷污，为每年雨水汇注时积成的水波。东西长二十里，南北长十二里。共占地十二万九千六百亩。去年南运河决口灌入该淀，水最深处约一丈余。县政府为排除积水污扩大耕地面积，曾于去年十一月，发动民工，由该淀至石碑河开一长十二里宽两丈的引河泄水。因系冬季水流不畅，未能完全排出。今年三月初尚占东西十二里，南北八里水深约一尺半。为了不妨害春耕，县政府复于三月七日发动群众一千二百人疏浚，仅用一天完成，到四月八日水深仅剩五寸，尚占地二百亩。据当地农民说：有水也能种上顷麻。又东关区李才高村南有个污，去年亦受运河决口水所漫，积水占地两千亩，周围土地多被浸坏，政府已于三月二十九日动员民工四百人挖沟向石碑河排泄，至四月八日水已泄完，全部均能种植。两污泄水工作完成后，计扩大耕地面积十三万一千六百亩，土地湿润肥沃，现群众正愉快地忙着播种。
