Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: TASS reports: The third post-war International Industrial Exhibition held in Poznań, western Poland, has recently closed. State-owned and private companies from nineteen countries participated in this exhibition. This exhibition demonstrated the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in post-war economic development, as well as the stagnation of industry in capitalist countries. The outstanding Soviet machine tools and the latest precision instruments and high-quality industrial products were the most eye-catching. The quality of many Soviet machines was better than that of the Western European countries on display. For example, compared with the Soviet-made giant excavator, the French-made excavator looked like a toy. The Soviet universal drilling machine is unparalleled in the world, and it can drill 953 meters per minute. At the same time, the exhibition also demonstrated the economic achievements of People's Democratic countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania. Polish-made machines and other items illustrate that Poland has firmly embarked on the road to industrialization. Polish industry is now producing tractors, automobiles, agricultural machinery, looms, and equipment for the textile and coal mining industries. Czechoslovakia also displayed a number of excellent machines and other products. New and perfect designs demonstrate the progress of science and technology. On the other hand, the pavilions of some Marshall Plan European countries, such as France, the Netherlands, and Austria, showed the stagnation of science and technology. No new or improved designs could be seen in the machine tools and other equipment displayed by these countries. This is because Western designers have no interest in inventing machines that reduce human labor.

    波兰国际工业展览会上
    苏联科学技术无比进步
    资本主义各国则停滞落后
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社讯：在波兰西部波兹南城举行的战后第三次国际工业博览会已在最近闭幕。参加这次博览会的有十九个国家的国营和私营的公司。这次博览会表现出苏联与人民民主国家战后经济的辉煌成就，和资本主义国家工业的停滞。出色的苏联母机和最新式的精确器械及高等质量的工业品最引人注目。许多苏联机器的质量都比西欧国家所陈列的好，例如法国造的挖掘机和苏联造的巨型挖掘机相形之下，就是玩具一样。苏联万能钻孔机是举世无双的，它每分钟可钻九百五十三公尺。同时，博览会上也表现出了波、捷、保、匈、罗、阿等人民民主国家的经济成就。波兰造的机器以及其他物品说明了波兰已经坚定地走上了工业化的道路。波兰工业现在正生产着拖拉机、汽车、农业机器、织布机及纺织与采煤工业等设备。捷克斯洛伐克也陈列了若干优良的机器和其他产品。新的完美的设计证明了科学与技术的进步。另一方面，若干马歇尔化的欧洲国家如法、荷、奥等国的陈列馆则表现出科学与技术的停滞。这些国家所陈列的母机及其他设备都看不出什么新的或改良的设计。这是由于西方的设计家们对于发明减轻人类劳动的机器，毫无兴趣。
