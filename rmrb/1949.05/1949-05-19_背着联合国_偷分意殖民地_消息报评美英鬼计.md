Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 17th: TASS Moscow, May 14th: An Izvestia observer commented on the United Nations Third Session, Second General Assembly's discussion regarding the fate of former Italian colonies, stating: The US and UK representatives, at the Paris Conference (United Nations Third Session, First General Assembly), spared no effort to delay discussions on the fate of former Italian colonies. The purpose of this delay was to reach an agreement behind the back of the United Nations to effectively divide the former Italian colonies. At the UN Second General Assembly, history has repeated itself; the only difference is that Italy has become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Italian representatives are now participating in behind-the-scenes negotiations regarding the fate of former Italian colonies. While US and UK representatives are again sparing no effort in the conference to delay decisions on the fate of former Italian colonies, Bevin and Sforza are conducting negotiations in London that effectively divide the former Italian colonies. The agreement reached by Bevin and Sforza does not mention a single word of the US's previous demands on Tripolitania, but it does include a reservation stating: Representatives of the United States and other countries will participate in the temporary advisory committee established under the British administrative authority until 1951. This is of great significance. The fact is that, as a result of Italy's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the conclusion of US imperialist bilateral agreements under the Marshall Plan, all Italian territory is now subject to the United States establishing US naval and air force bases. Therefore, Sforza's argument that the agreement he reached in London "saved Italy's interests in Tripolitania" and "saved Italy's honor on the Eritrean issue" is merely intended to deceive Italian discussion. In fact, the London Agreement has tightened the noose around Italy's neck held by the British. The events of July 1943 (referring to Italy's surrender) and the terms of the 1947 treaty had given Italy every possibility of permanently ending its dependence on foreign groups, but the Gasperi government has done everything possible to turn Italy into a tool of the US-UK bloc.

　　背着联合国
  　偷分意殖民地
  　消息报评美英鬼计
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：消息报观察家评论联合国第三届第二次大会对前意属殖民地命运的讨论说：美英代表曾在巴黎会议（联合国第三届第一次大会）上不惜用一切手段以拖延讨论前意属殖民地的命运。这种拖延的目的，是为了背着联合国达成实际瓜分前意属殖民地的协议。在联大第二次会议上，历史又重演了，唯一不同的是，意大利成了北大西洋公约的一员，对前意属殖民地命运的幕后谈判，现在有意大利代表参加了。当美英代表再次在会议上不遗余力地拖延对前意属殖民地命运的决定时，贝文和史佛卓却在伦敦进行实际上是瓜分前意属殖民地的谈判。贝文与史佛卓达成的协议，没有一个字提到美国以前对的黎波里地尼亚的要求，但是却附有保留说：美国和其他国家的代表，将参加在英国行政当局之下设立的临时咨询委员会直至一九五一年为止，这是具有重大意义的。事实是由于意大利参加北大西洋公约和依照马歇尔计划缔结美帝双边协定的结果，全部意大利的领土，已经都听由美国建立美国海军与空军基地了。所以，史佛卓说什么他在伦敦达成的协定，“拯救了意大利在的黎波里地尼亚的利益”以及“在厄立特里亚问题上拯救了意大利的光荣”等等论调的目的，不过是蒙蔽意大利的讨论而已。事实上，伦敦协定已由英套在意大利脖劲上的绳索拉得更紧了。一九四三年七月的事件（指意大利投降）和一九四七年和约的条款，曾经给予意大利以永远终止依赖外国集团的一切可能性，但是，加斯贝利政府却尽一切可能把意大利变成美英集团的目工具。
