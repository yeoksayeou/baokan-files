    Conscientiously Abide by Revolutionary Order

    After the reactionary ruling institutions in cities like Beiping and Tianjin were overthrown, a new revolutionary order was established. The people, who had long suffered under the oppression of feudal forces, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, raised their heads for the first time and began to govern their own country and cities as masters. Everywhere, one could hear the free singing of the people, and the term "liberation" became the most glorious slogan. The people's political enthusiasm was greatly unleashed. Relying on the revolutionary fighting spirit of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people, the Party smoothly completed the takeover work and further arranged and is arranging various political, economic, cultural, and educational orders and systems. Everything will gradually be brought onto the right track, marching in step towards a new democratic and productive city.

    However, at the same time, some inappropriate misunderstandings and impermissible chaotic phenomena have occurred in certain places, which must be corrected. For example, in terms of municipal administration, street vendors almost set up stalls in the middle of the road, making it impossible to maintain traffic. Car accidents are still happening constantly. Some police officers are afraid of "offending people" when dealing with any violations of public order and dare not act according to the rules (it was wrong to unreasonably beat and scold the masses in the past, but it does not mean that they dare not act according to revolutionary rules today). The phenomenon of wasting water and electricity is also relatively common. In terms of school education, students in various schools have gained political freedom and liberation and have begun to receive a new education, which is a great progress. However, some individuals mistakenly believe that the old courses and systems are all undesirable and hope to start a new set all at once. This has somewhat hindered their studies. Some new cadres and the masses also have some misunderstandings about "liberation," thinking that liberation means "no one can control anyone." For example, twisting the Yangko dance is a very good thing. It does reflect the joy and happiness of the people after liberation, but some people insist on twisting it on the tram tracks for half an hour, causing trams, cars, and pedicabs to be squeezed together, making it impossible to pass through, which hinders city traffic. Although these phenomena are only individual and local phenomena, they must be brought to everyone's attention, and we cannot sit idly by and watch them expand. It should be recognized that a revolutionary order must be established in the people's city. This order is stipulated according to the needs and wishes of the people themselves. The people's compliance with the revolutionary order is compliance with the order stipulated by themselves, which is beneficial to everyone. Only when the people consciously abide by the revolutionary order can the foundation of the revolutionary order be consolidated and the saboteurs have no opportunity to take advantage of. Without order, there is no true people's democratic dictatorship, and it is impossible to carry out various reforms in an organized and planned manner. This point should be widely and repeatedly educated and explained to cadres and the broad masses of the people so that they understand the necessity of establishing a revolutionary order, in order to overcome the current "chaotic" phenomena existing in individual places in a timely and effective manner ideologically. The revolutionary order cannot be completely achieved solely by relying on top-down administrative orders. It must obtain the support of the broad masses of the people in the liberated areas. Everyone should abide by the revolutionary order! Everyone is responsible for coming up with various active ways to establish a new order in the people's city!

    认真遵守革命秩序
    平津等城市在推翻了反动的统治机构之后，一个新的革命秩序建立起来了。久受封建势力、帝国主义、官僚资本主义压迫的人民第一次抬起头来，开始以主人翁资格治理自己的国家和城市，到处可以听到人民自由的歌唱，“解放”这一名词成了最光荣的口号。人民的政治积极性是大大地发挥了。党依靠着无产阶级及广大人民的革命斗争性，顺利地完成了接管工作，又进一步安排了与正在安排着各种有关政治、经济、文化、教育的秩序和制度，一切均将逐步纳入正轨，整齐步伐，向新民主主义的生产城市迈进。
    但是与此同时，某些地方却又发生了不应有的误会与不可允许的混乱现象，必须加以纠正。譬如在市政方面，摊贩几乎要摆到马路中心致使交通无法维持，车祸尚在不断发生，有的警察对于一切违犯公共秩序现象竟怕“得罪人”而不敢按规矩办事（过去无理打骂群众是不对的，但不等于今天不敢按革命的规矩办事），水电浪费现象也较普遍。在学校教育方面，各地学校学生得到了政治上的自由解放，开始接受了新教育，这是极大的进步，但也有个别的人误以为旧有的课程和制度都要不得，希望一下子都重来一套。这样反而多少有些妨害了学业。在某些新干部和群众中对于“解放”也有若干误解，以为解放就是“谁也不能管谁”，比如扭秧歌本是件很好的事情，它确是反映了人民解放后的喜悦和欢乐，可是有些人，硬要在电车道路扭上一个半个钟头，让电车汽车三轮车挤在一起，水泄不通，结果妨害全市交通。以上这些现象，虽只是个别的局部的现象，但也必须引起大家注意，不能坐视其扩大。应当认识到：人民的城市必须建立起革命秩序，这种秩序是根据人民自己的需要与愿望规定的，人民遵守革命的秩序便是遵守自己的规定的秩序，这对每个人都是有利益的，只有人民自觉遵守革命秩序，才能使革命秩序的基础巩固起来，才能使破坏分子无隙可乘，没有秩序便没有真正的人民民主专政，也便不可能有组织有计划地进行各种改革，这一点，应在干部及广大人民中进行广泛地反复地教育和解释，使他们懂得建立革命秩序之必要，以便从思想上及时地有效地克服目前个别地方存在的“混乱”现象，革命的秩序不是单纯依靠从上而下的行政命令所能完全做到的，必须获得解放区广大人民的支持，大家都来遵守革命秩序！大家负责想出各种积极办法来建立人民城市的新秩序！
