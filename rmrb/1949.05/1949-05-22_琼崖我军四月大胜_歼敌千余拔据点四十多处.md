Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 21st – The Qiongya People's Liberation Army continued to expand its spring offensive in April, achieving significant victories. In one month, it eliminated two battalions and one platoon of the Kuomintang regular army, four companies of local self-defense forces, one company of mine police, and self-defense units belonging to eighteen puppet township governments, totaling over 1,140 enemies killed, wounded, or captured. It also captured over 40 enemy strongholds and fortifications, including the well-known Shilu Iron Mine area and Guangba Hydropower Plant, and briefly liberated the county town of Gan'en. The progress of the offensive over the past month is as follows:

	Qiongxi Area: After liberating most of Dan County, the People's Liberation Army extended its operations southwestward. On April 5th, it surrounded Nanchen, an important stronghold near Nada City. After three days of fighting, it completely annihilated the entire First and Second Companies of the Dan County Self-Defense General Brigade, the Dan County Sixth督剿区 Office, and all self-defense units of four puppet townships in Baisha, killing, wounding, and capturing 254 enemies, including Fu Yinglin, the director of the Dan County Sixth 督剿区 Office and the puppet district chief of the Third District of Baisha. On the 16th, the People's Liberation Army simultaneously launched attacks on the Shilu Iron Mine area and its outer stronghold of Baoqiao. On the afternoon of the 17th, all enemy forces defending Shilu were annihilated. The enemy at Baoqiao surrendered the next day. In this battle, 190 enemies, including Zhao Guanggang, the puppet county chief of Baisha and commander of the Self-Defense General Brigade, and Chen Wencai, the deputy commander, were captured alive, and 15 enemies were killed. The Liberation Army then advanced south in pursuit of victory. From the 20th, it surrounded most of the enemy's 476th Regiment of the 159th Division and reactionary local armed joint defense teams in the strongholds of Baoban and Reshui in Changjiang County and Dongfang Guangba in Ledong County. The enemy soldiers lacked morale and surrendered in entire companies and platoons. By the morning of the 27th, the entire battle was over, with a total of over 530 enemies killed or captured, including Mo Jianzhen (killed), the major regimental adjutant of the 476th Regiment, Long Lichang, the commander of the Second Battalion, and Chen Deqing, the commander of the Third Battalion. Forty-five light and heavy machine guns, one mortar, twenty-two grenade launchers and rifle grenades, and 310 rifles and carbines were seized.

	Qiongnan Area: On April 3rd, the Liberation Army annihilated a platoon of the Yulin Fortress Army near the Northeast Railway Station airport in Ya County. On the 20th, in coordination with the Battle of Dongfang Guangba, it occupied eight enemy strongholds in the Banqiao area southeast of Gan'en County and briefly liberated Gan'en County. Under the active operations of the Liberation Army, the enemy forces at the two important strongholds of Dongzhong and Jiusuo in Ya County also fled to Ya County.

	Qiongbei Area: The local corps of the Liberation Army successively annihilated the self-defense units belonging to five puppet townships—Baofang, Dongge, Touyuan, Dade, and Shuibei—in Wenchang County, capturing over 100 enemies alive and seizing 121 rifles and carbines.

	Qiongdongnan Area: On the 26th, the local corps of the Liberation Army completely annihilated the defending enemy forces and the self-defense units of the puppet township government at the Liqi stronghold and liberated enemy strongholds such as Changpo and Yuanshui near Wancheng.

Under the influence of our army's victories, enemy soldiers defected in large numbers. On April 3rd, a squad of prison guards in Qiongshan County defected and released over 80 innocent people who had been detained. On the 11th, ten soldiers of the First Company of the Yaxian Xinxi First Fort Fortress Army, led by squad leader Zhou Hui, defected, bringing with them two light machine guns and seven rifles.
