　　Northern Factory Affairs Conference Group Discussions
  　Unanimous Guarantee to Complete Tasks
    Raise Work Efficiency by Forty Percent in the Second Half of the Year
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Northern Factory Affairs Conference held group discussions on the 25th to study the work tasks for the second half of the year. During the discussions, most representatives expressed great confidence in the targets set by Zhou Xiaping, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Mechanical Affairs, regarding the June tasks and work efficiency for the second half of the year; only a few staff members one-sidedly emphasized difficulties and expressed hesitation about completing the tasks. Group discussions continued on the 26th. A representative of the Tangshan workers stated that there was no problem with the conference's requirement to increase efficiency by 40% based on the original effectiveness. He said, "We must advance with the overall goal of Minister Teng to complete the construction of railways across the country! We must race on this road to see who reaches the finish line first. We have confidence. As long as we are determined to do it, and plan well, there are no walls blocking the road that we cannot overcome." A representative of the Changxindian workers stated in his speech: "The task must be completed. Our workers' hands are omnipotent. If there are any difficulties, we must try our best to overcome them. Now that we have become masters, the burden on our shoulders is heavier. We must put in effort and be concerned about managing this home. We cannot be complacent. We must use our machines so that 'people rest but machines don't stop'." Everyone should think of ways, use their brains, and use day and night shifts to ensure the task can be completed." The Tangshan workers' representative proposed four guarantees for completing this production task: (1) Respond to the call of Minister Teng and Deputy Minister Lü to reform the factory; (2) Establish a factory responsibility system (package inspection, package repair, package use) to achieve joint labor, everyone being responsible, and everything being responsible; (3) Promote the creativity of employees, utilize waste materials, and ensure the completion of the tasks given by the higher authorities. The representatives present spoke actively. Finally, Deputy Director Zhou gave a brief summary. He called on all factories to find ways to solve difficulties, promote the spirit of hard work in building the country, give full play to creativity, use waste to manufacture substitutes, and save material resources. In order to complete the task, it is necessary to: (1) rely on the strength of the working class; (2) have planning in production; (3) establish a responsibility system; (4) organize production forces. The production plan was officially finalized at 3:00 p.m. Everyone unanimously resolved to guarantee the completion of this task.
