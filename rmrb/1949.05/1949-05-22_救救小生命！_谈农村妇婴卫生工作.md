　　Save the Little Lives!
　　——On Rural Maternal and Child Health Work
　　Starting from a Fact
　　Liang Xue's is forty-two years old this year and lives in Laozhuang, Seventh District of Yanggu. She had previously given birth to three children, all of whom died from umbilical cord tetanus. After the death of the second child, someone told her: "If you bite off one of the child's toes, the next child will be saved." She listened to others and bit off one of the child's toes, but the third child still died from umbilical cord tetanus. Liang Xue's had no choice but to accept her fate. When she was about to give birth to her fourth child, she was very distressed, but she heard from the people at the hospital: "Umbilical cord tetanus is caused by unclean cutting of the umbilical cord by the old midwives. If a new method of delivery is used, the child will not get umbilical cord tetanus." So she asked the comrades from the hospital to deliver the baby. Now, not only did the child not get umbilical cord tetanus, but he is also growing very healthy.
　　Looking at it from a Statistical Figure
　　We conducted a survey in Laozhuang and Xuelou villages in Yanggu Seventh District. Twelve women gave birth to a total of forty-four babies. Thirty-two births were delivered by the old method, but twenty-five children died, and only seven survived. Among them, eighteen died from umbilical cord tetanus, accounting for seventy-two percent of the mortality rate. Twelve births were delivered by the new method, and every child survived.
　　How to Change this Situation?
　　From the above specific facts, we can see the urgent need for maternal and child health work in rural areas. However, because the masses lack scientific knowledge and have strong feudal superstitious ideas, the first step is to vigorously promote the benefits of new methods of delivery and the reasons why old methods of delivery easily cause umbilical cord tetanus, along with general health knowledge. This can be done through skits, shadow plays, and other forms, along with specific facts, to carry out widespread publicity and education to the masses. At the same time, free deliveries are provided to the masses. Some women, after experiencing new methods of delivery themselves and realizing the benefits, promote it to relatives and friends everywhere. Now, the masses have slowly changed their old superstitious views and believe in scientific methods of delivery. Secondly, under the leadership of the district party committee and the administrative office, the Health Bureau has specially established a midwifery training team in the health school, and midwifery training classes have also been established in each administrative office to reform the old midwives. At the same time, it is hoped that governments at all levels will pay attention to maternal and child health work. Female comrades working in local areas, in particular, should often educate the masses with some maternal and child health knowledge.

### 救救小生命！——谈农村妇婴卫生工作

　　救救小生命！
    ——谈农村妇婴卫生工作
    从一个事实说起
    梁薛氏今年四十二岁了，住在阳谷七区老庄，她以前曾生过三个孩子，都得脐风死了。在第二个小孩死后，有人告诉她：你把小孩的脚指头咬掉一个，下次孩子就保住了。她听了别人的话，就把孩子的脚指头咬掉一个，但是第三个孩子，还是得脐风死了。梁薛氏只好自认命苦。到这次快生第四胎时，她很苦恼，但听医院的人说：“得脐风是因旧接生婆剪脐带时不干净，若用新法接生，小孩便不会得脐风了。”于是她便请医院的同志来接生，现在小孩不但没有得脐风，并且长得很健康。
    从一个统计数字来看
    我们在阳谷七区老庄、薛楼两村做了一个调查，十二个妇女，共生产四十四胎，由旧法接生的有三十二胎，但死了二十五个小孩，只活了七个。其中得脐风死的便有十八个，占死亡率的百分之七十二。由新法接生的有十二胎，每个小孩都活着。
    如何改变这种情况？
    从以上的具体事实中，可以看出妇婴卫生工作在农村中的迫切需要。但因为群众缺乏科学知识，有浓厚的封建迷信思想。首先是大力宣传新法接生的好处，和旧法接生容易起脐风的道理，加上一般的卫生常识，以化装剧、拉洋片等形式，加上具体事实向群众广泛的进行宣传教育。同时还免费给群众接生。有些妇女本人经新法接生，知道了好处后，到处向亲友宣传。现在群众已慢慢的改变了旧的迷信观点，相信科学的接生法了。其次，卫生局在区党委、行署领导下，在卫生学校特设了助产训练队，又在各专署成立了助产训练班，以改造旧的接生婆。同时并希望各级政府对妇婴卫生工作重视起来。作地方工作的女同志，尤其要经常把一些妇婴卫生常识教育群众。
