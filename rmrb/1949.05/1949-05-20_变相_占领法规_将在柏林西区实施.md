　　Disguised "Occupation Statute"
　　To Be Implemented in West Berlin

　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 18th: Due to the continued pursuit of a divisive policy by the US, British, and French authorities in Germany, a disguised "Occupation Statute" is about to be implemented in West Berlin. According to reports from American and French news agencies in Berlin, the military governors of the US, British, and French zones in Germany signed a so-called "autonomous statute" for West Berlin on the 14th. Like the "Occupation Statute" that enslaves the people of West Germany, the West Berlin "autonomous statute" nominally "gives the Germans in West Berlin direct administrative control," but the US, British, and French governors "reserve extensive supervisory powers." Regarding this matter, the German News Agency commented that the new statute of the Western governors is a contract of enslavement, and this contract is clear evidence of the West German state's attempt to permanently occupy Germany and deny the sovereignty of the German people.

　　变相“占领法规”
  　将在柏林西区实施
    【新华社北平十八日电】由于德境美英法当局继续推行分裂政策，变相的“占领法规”行将在柏林西区实施。据美法通讯社自柏林报导，德境美英法军事总督于十四日签署柏林西区的所谓“自治法规”。和奴役西德人民的“占领法规”一样，柏林西区“自治法规”在名义上“给德国人在柏林西区有直接的行政管理权”，但是美英法三总督却又“保留了广泛的监督权”。关于此事，德意志通讯社评称：西方总督的新法规是奴役的契约，这种契约是西德国家企图永远占领德国并否认德国人民的主权之明证。
