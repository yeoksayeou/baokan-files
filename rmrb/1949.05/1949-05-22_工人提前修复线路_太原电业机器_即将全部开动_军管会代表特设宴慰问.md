　　Workers Repair Lines Ahead of Schedule
  　Taiyuan Electric Power Machines to be Fully Operational
  　Military Control Commission Representative Hosts Banquet to Express Appreciation
    [Taiyuan Electric] On the afternoon of the 15th, over 600 workers at the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau, with unparalleled excitement and joy, for the first time gloriously accepted the sincere appreciation of their own Party – the Communist Party. In the past twenty days, they created amazing achievements. Of the city's twenty-one power lines, originally scheduled to be completed by June 25th, all have now been completed except for lines 7, 1, and a branch of line 6. This exceeds the plan by more than 100%. All factory machines will soon be fully operational because of this. At the same time, the 3,000-kilowatt generator at the power plant outside the city, after being completely cleaned and repaired, also began transmitting power ahead of schedule on the same day (previously, only one 1,200-kilowatt generator at the plant was transmitting power). In order to get the factories up and running as soon as possible, the workers worked tirelessly, rain or shine, and did not go home for lunch every day. Some groups tried to reduce their mealtime to rush the work. When the workers at the power plant outside the city began repairing the machines, they voluntarily proposed: We must complete it ahead of schedule to have glory and be like what the military representative said, "We are the masters of the country." They worked two shifts a day, twelve hours per shift, starting on May 3rd. Originally scheduled to be completed in half a month, it was also completed three days early, beginning power transmission on the 15th. To show appreciation for them, the Industrial Takeover Group of the Taiyuan Military Control Commission held a banquet on the afternoon of the 15th at the Electric Power Bureau to express gratitude for the hard work of all staff and workers, and allocated 6,000 catties of millet as a reward. When Comrade Liu Qingyu, the military representative and Party representative of the Electric Power Bureau, on behalf of the Party, publicly expressed his appreciation to them for the first time and read out the letter of appreciation from the military representative of the Industrial Takeover Group, the workers listened solemnly to every word. After the military representative finished speaking, Li Junhua, an electrician, immediately stood up and said: "Yan Xishan didn't let us eat, didn't let us dress, didn't let us live. Now the Communist Party has come. The Communist Party is our own Party, and the work is what we should do ourselves. In the future, I will work even harder." After the banquet, the workers were invited to watch a movie at the newly opened cinema.

　　工人提前修复线路
  　太原电业机器  即将全部开动
  　军管会代表特设宴慰问
    【太原电】十五日下午，太原市电业处六百余工人以无比的兴奋和喜悦，首次光荣地接受自己的党——共产党对自己的热忱慰问。在过去二十天内，他们创造了惊人的成绩。全市二十一条线路，原计划于六月二十五日完成，但现除七路、一路、六路支线三条没修好外，其余已全部完成，超过计划百分之一百尚多，所有工厂机器从此即将全部开动。同时，城外发电厂三千基罗瓦特发电机，经过全部擦洗及修装，亦提前于同日开始送电（在此以前，该厂送电的仅一千二百基罗瓦特发电机一部）。为使各工厂尽早开工，工人们，风雨无阻，每天不回家吃午饭。有的组尽量减少吃饭时间赶工，城外发电厂工人开始修理机器时，自动提出：我们一定要提前完成，才有光彩，才象军事代表说的“咱是国家的主人”。每日两班。每班十二小时，从五月三日开始，原计划半月修理完成，但亦提早三天于十五日开始送电。太原市军管会工业接管组为慰问他们，特于十五日下午假电业处设宴招待慰问全体职工的辛劳，并拨小米六千斤作为奖励。当电业处军事代表兼党代表刘庆宇同志代表党首次公开向他们慰问并宣读工业接管组军事代表的慰问信时，工人们严肃地听着每字每句。军事代表说完后，电机工李俊华，马上站出来说：“阎锡山不叫我们吃，不叫我们穿，不叫我们生活，现在共产党来了，共产党是我们自己的党，工作是我们自己应该作的，今后我要更加努力工作”。会餐后并在新开电影院招待工人看电影。
