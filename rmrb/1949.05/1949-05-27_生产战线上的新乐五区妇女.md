Women in Xinle Fifth District on the Production Front
    The women of Xinle Fifth District have historically participated in agricultural production. This spring, under the call and leadership of the district committee, 90% of the women in the district's twenty villages have participated in various forms of production such as watering gardens, hoeing wheat, plowing, and planting cotton, becoming a powerful force on the production front.

    Everywhere are Female Farmers
    As soon as spring arrived, the work in the fields became busy. Many women put down their spinning wheels and started delivering manure, watering gardens, hoeing wheat, and harrowing land. Everyone was busy. In Liujia Village, under the leadership of the village women's federation director, Lu Miaolan, fifty-one women went to work in the fields. The village's 567 mu of wheat fields had been watered three times, mostly by women. In Taiping Village, thirty women learned to drive carts. From morning to evening, one could see many working women, heads wrapped and trousers hitched up, sweating as they labored in the vast fields. The old ladies praised them, saying, "These young women and daughters-in-law are almost as good as men!"

    Two Good Examples
    秀勤 (Xiùqín) from Liujia Village is only fifteen years old. Her two older brothers joined the army, and her four older sisters have married out. At home, it's just her and her parents, who are in their sixties. From a young age, she studied while helping her parents farm their eighteen mu of land. Because the work in the fields was too busy, she left school last year and became the main force of production in the family. She gradually learned to drive carts, water the land, and plow. She refused to fall behind in any heavy work. When the father and daughter were loading manure, her father, afraid she would exhaust herself, borrowed a small shovel for her. She resentfully threw down the small shovel and exchanged it for a large shovel weighing five jin, forcefully loading it onto the cart. There is also Cui Xiaohai, a forty-eight-year-old woman. Her husband died three years ago, and she is raising four children while also taking care of thirteen mu of land. Through long-term labor training, she learned agricultural techniques such as hoeing, plowing, and planting. This year, she applied ten cartloads of manure to each mu of land, and her three mu of wheat have been watered three times. She has also planted three mu of sorghum and three mu of corn. In addition, she planted one mu of cotton and half a mu of peanuts. Cui Xiaohai and Xiuqin, one old and one young, are no weaker than men when they work. Their good names are spread throughout the villages around Liujia Village.

    Labor Improves Political Status
    Due to the widespread participation of women in production, their status in the family and society has significantly improved. For example, the young bride of Xiao Zhu in ×× Village works in the fields just like her husband, and her mother-in-law treats her like her own daughter. Chen Jie and Xiangzhen, along with six other women from Liujia Village, have been accepted into the Communist Youth League. You ×× from Dongyang Village was elected as a representative of the Communist Youth League and was later elected as a county representative. On April 26th, the village established a Communist Youth League Committee, with two of the five members being women. Although most of the women in Xinle Fifth District participated in production, only a few villages such as Liujia Village and Taiping Village have organizations that truly play a role. Chenjia Village and three other villages do not yet have women cadres and cannot fully utilize organizational strength. We should continue to deepen mobilization, pay attention to solving the actual difficulties of women in production, educate parents to properly care for the suffering of women, and further consolidate the foundation for women's participation in production.

### 生产战线上的新乐五区妇女

　　生产战线上的新乐五区妇女
    新乐五区的妇女们，过去就有参加田间生产的习惯，今春在区委的号召领导下，全区二十个村已有百分之九十的妇女，参加了浇园、锄麦、耕耩、种棉等各种生产，成为生产战线上一支有力的大军。
  　遍地尽是女庄稼汉
    一开春地里的活就忙开了，许多妇女放下了纺线车子，送粪、浇园、锄麦、打耙地，大家都忙碌起来。刘家庄的妇女在该村妇联会主任路苗兰的带动下，有五十一个妇女下地做活，该村有五百六十七亩麦田已浇过了三水，大部都是妇女浇的。太平庄有三十个妇女学会了庥车赶车。每天从早晨到傍晚都可以看到许许多多包着头挟着裤腿的劳动妇女，流着汗在广旷的田野里劳动着，老太太们夸奖她们说：“这帮闺女媳妇们，简直快赶上男子汉！”
  　两个好榜样
    刘家庄的秀勤，今年才十五岁，两个哥哥参了军，四个姐姐出了嫁，家里除了她就是六十多岁的爹娘。她从小就一面念书，一面帮着爹娘种着十八亩地，因地里的活实在忙不过来，去年她离开了学校，成了家中生产的主力。她渐渐学会了赶车、浇地、耕地，什么重活她都不肯落人后，爷儿俩个装粪时，她爹怕她累坏了身体，给他借了一把小铁锹，她不服气的扔下小铁锹，换了一把有五斤重的大铁锹，使劲的往车上装。还有四十八岁的妇女崔小海，她丈夫已死了三年，拉扯着四个孩子，还得照管着十三亩地。在经久的劳动锻炼中，她学会了锄地耕地耩地等农业技术。今年她每亩地都上了十来车粪，三亩麦子已经浇了三遍，三亩高粱和三亩玉蜀黍也都耩上了。另外她还种了一亩棉花和半亩花生。崔小海和秀勤这一老一少，做活都不比男子汉弱，刘家庄一带的村庄，到处都传扬着他俩的美名。
    劳动提高了政治地位
    由于广大妇女参加了生产，她们在家庭和社会上的地位，有了显著的提高。如××村小猪新娶的媳妇，和丈夫一样的下地做活，婆婆把她当亲闺女一样看待。刘家庄陈姐和香珍等八个妇女，被吸收参加了青年团。东杨村优××被选为青年团的代表，后又被选为县代表。四月二十六日该村成立了团委会，五个委员中有两个是妇女。新乐五区的妇女，虽然大部参加了生产，但在组织上真正起作用的，只有刘家庄和太平庄等几个村，陈家庄等四个村还没有妇女干部，不能充分发挥组织力量。还应继续深入发动，注意解决妇女在生产中的实际困难，教育家长适当的照顾妇女本身疾苦，使妇女参加生产的基础进一步巩固起来。
