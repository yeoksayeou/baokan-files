The 1,200 members of the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers today express the following opinions to all scientific workers in China and the world with boundless excitement and the close feelings of colleagues.

After the end of the First World War, the Chinese people and their intellectual vanguard, who had long suffered from the dual oppression of internal and external imperialism and feudalism, launched the May Fourth Movement, an epoch-making event in modern Chinese history. That war between the imperialists exposed the undeniable degenerate and criminal nature of imperialism, and as a result, on a vast corner of the sinking earth, the great Lenin and the heroic people of the Soviet Union created the first socialist country in human history. At the same time, on the other hand, U.S. President Wilson proposed fourteen principles to the victorious countries at the postwar spoils-sharing conference, one of which was the right to self-determination for all nations around the world. However, this proposal ultimately failed. These two events profoundly educated the Chinese educated youth of the time, making them realize that among the reasons for the long-term weakness of modern China, in addition to the long-term oppression of international imperialism, there was a lack of a democratic system and spirit in domestic politics, and insufficient cultivation of scientific research. It was also at this time that the imperialist powers at the Paris Peace Conference induced the Chinese representatives to sign a treaty selling Shandong Province's sovereignty to Japanese imperialism. When this news reached Beiping, the political capital of China at the time, it angered the city's university students and a portion of politically conscious citizens, so they held a demonstration warning the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, who were then flattering Japanese imperialism, injuring one of them and destroying one of their residences. As a result, after a month of support from students and citizens in major cities across the country, the government at the time yielded to this righteous patriotic act, not only daring not to blame the students, but also dismissing the three important senior officials who had been attacked and ordering the Chinese representatives attending the Paris Peace Conference to refuse to sign the humiliating treaty with Japan.

The political, social, and cultural significance of this movement was enormous, pointing out a path for the development of democratic politics and scientific cultivation in later China. The people's demands for democracy and the pursuit of scientific research have made gradual progress to varying degrees and with twists and turns. In particular, the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party two years after this movement added substantial content and definite guarantees to this demand for democracy and science under extremely difficult and arduous conditions. The creation of the genius New Democracy was born in this extremely difficult and arduous environment.

Today, this "May Fourth" festival has reached its thirtieth anniversary. Under the leadership of the New Democratic principles, the power of the Chinese people has achieved vast and far-reaching victories, clearing away reactionary obstacles for the healthy development of democracy and science, providing a strong guarantee for the cause of stabilizing world peace, and enhancing the prospect of fraternal cooperation between Chinese and world scientific workers. Our excitement and confidence in developing scientific undertakings are not difficult to imagine. Especially after the power of the Chinese people has gained control of the birthplace of this "May Fourth" movement, the focus of China's social transformation has shifted to the cities leading the countryside. The contradictions and estrangement between urban and rural areas that have existed since history began have been eliminated. From now on, China's urgent need for industry and science is the first practical issue on the work agenda of the entire nation, and it is by no means the empty talk on paper of the old era of feudal warlord bureaucratic rule and letting imperialism oppress us.

We do not hesitate to say that in the past thirty years, Chinese scientific workers, due to the different social conditions they were in and because they already had a tradition of pursuing the dual demands of democracy and science, found it easier to understand the relationship between science and politics and to appreciate the sense of social responsibility of scientific workers compared to scientific workers in industrialized capitalist countries, even though their strength was relatively weak. In the past thirty years of experience, Chinese scientific research, under extremely difficult conditions, has also had a period of development; in particular, regional sciences such as geology, biology, and meteorology have also achieved some success. However, it is also this experience that proves that the ruling power represented by Chiang Kai-shek is not worthy of undertaking the responsibility of developing China's industry and science. Not to mention that during the long and arduous struggle of China's resistance against Japanese aggression, this ruling power would rather allow the evil virtues of corruption and decay to run rampant in China, weakening the development of China's healthy forces, and letting the achievements of the old and weak scientific undertakings wither and be difficult to revive. This is something that the world has witnessed, but the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique is only willing to shirk its responsibility in a rogue manner by blaming the difficult conditions. Let us cite two other examples to illustrate our meaning: one is that Chiang Kai-shek's agents killed Mr. Yang Xingfo, a capable mechanical engineer who was assisting Mr. Cai Yuanpei in presiding over China's most important scientific research institution, as early as 1931, simply because Mr. Yang had participated in the human rights protection movement. This was still the period when the Chinese bourgeoisie and imperialists praised Chiang Kai-shek's "achievements," while Mr. Yang was a person who had considerable affection for the United States, was one of the founders of the Chinese Science Society, and had promoted scientific undertakings for many years. The other thing is that Mr. Fan Xudong, who founded China's chemical industry and presided over China's industrial chemical research with the most outstanding achievements, encountered obstacles in his career: with his lifelong effort of thirty years, he did not beg for the help of the corrupt government forces, but established and developed his career on a tortuous road, winning praise from both domestic and international sources. On the eve of the imminent victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he went to the United States and borrowed US$16 million from the Export-Import Bank there with an independent and autonomous stance as funds to restore and expand his business. As a result, this matter was obstructed by the Chiang Kai-shek government: the reason was that this government would rather accept the plans of American monopoly capitalists and allow their surplus chemical plants to move to China to persecute China's national industry. As a result, Mr. Fan died in depression in Chongqing in October 1945. These two specific examples are enough to illustrate the reactionary and backward nature of the Chiang Kai-shek regime from the standpoint of scientific undertakings, not hesitating to be hostile to science; naturally, it is not necessary to say how it sold out national sovereignty, sold out the interests of the people, and allowed the manipulation of the American monopoly capitalist group, and was hostile to world peace and the people of the world.

Chinese scientific workers are very excited about the universal awakening of all just scientific workers around the world after World War II, understanding their social responsibilities, strengthening the organization and unity of colleagues, refusing to participate in any attempts to serve the interests of a few and be hostile to the people, and constantly issuing their protests and strength in the face of new threats to world peace and the development of the people. This shows that in the leap forward of the people's era, scientific workers consciously add a force, which will be able to make an effective contribution to reversing the brutal and unrestrained countercurrent of imperialism, stabilizing world peace, and enhancing the great ideals and goals of the friendship of brothers and sisters of the people all over the world. We should learn from the working model established by the scientific workers of the Soviet Union, collectively, in a planned way, and harmoniously do our best, and live up to the responsibilities that generations have entrusted to this generation of scientific workers.

We would like to take this festival, which is of special significance to Chinese scientific workers, to state the above wishes and confidence to scientific workers across the country and around the world.

Progressive scientific workers around the world, strengthen unity and strive to eliminate the crimes of imperialism that endanger the historical process of all mankind!
May 4, 1949, Beiping.

    全世界科学工作者团结起来，消灭帝国主义危害人类的罪行！
    ——“五四”卅周年纪念日中国科学工
    作者协会写给中国和世界科学工作者的公开信
    中国科学工作者协会的一千二百个会员们今天以无比的兴奋和同业者的亲切感情向中国和世界的一切科学工作者陈述下面的意见。
    在第一次世界大战刚刚结束以后，久经帝国主义与封建主义内外双重压迫的中国人民和他的知识先锋队，爆发了一次在中国现代史上具有划时代意义的“五四”运动。那一次帝国主义者之间互相火并的战争，暴露了帝国主义无法掩饰的堕落而罪恶的本质，结果逼使趋向沉沦的地球的广大一角上，耸出了伟大的列宁和苏联的英勇人民所创造的划断人类历史的第一个社会主义的国家。同时，在另一方面，当时的美国威尔逊总统向那一次的战后分贼性的战胜国和会里提出了十四条原则，其中之一是全世界各民族的自决权利，但结果这提议却遭受了失败。这两件事情深深地教育了当时的中国知识青年，使他们醒悟到现代中国积弱的原因之中，除去国际帝国主义的长期压迫之外，是缺少了国内政治的民主制度和精神，与科学研究培植的不足。也正在这个时候，巴黎和会中帝国主义诸强国诱迫中国代表签订出卖山东省主权给日本帝国主义的条约。这消息传到了当时中国政治首都的北平，激怒了全市的大学生青年和一部份有政治觉悟的市民，于是就举行了一次警告当时正在进行献媚日本帝国主义的外交部长和中国驻日公使的示威运动，打伤了其中之一人，毁坏了其中之一的住宅。结果经历了一个月的全国各大都市学生和市民的声援，当时的政府屈服于这一场正义的爱国行为，不仅不敢向学生问罪，而且罢免了当时被打击的三个重要高级官吏，命令出席巴黎和会中国的代表拒绝了对日本屈辱的条约的签字。
    这一场运动的政治社会和文化的意义是非常巨大的，替后来的中国民主政治和科学培植启示了一条发展的道路。人民的民主要求和科学研究的追索，在不同程度的曲折上，都有了逐时的进展。尤其是中国共产党在这一场运动以后的两年创立，更替这一个民主与科学的要求，在万分艰难与困苦的条件下，加添了充实的内容与确切的保证。天才的新民主主义的创造，就在这万分艰难与困苦里诞生。
    今天，这个“五四”的节日到了它的第三十周年，中国人民的力量在新民主主义原则的领导之下，取得了广大深远的胜利，为民主与科学的健康发展扫除了反动的障碍，为稳定世界和平的大业提出了有力的保障，为中国和全世界的科学工作者之间的合作增进了兄弟般携手同行的展望。我们的兴奋与发展科学事业的信心是不难想象的。尤其是正在中国人民的力量取得了这个产生“五四”运动的发祥地的管理权以后，中国社会改造的重心转为以城市领导农村，自有历史以来存在着的城乡矛盾与隔阂已经消除，今后中国对于工业与科学需要的迫切，是全国人民工作日程上的第一件实践问题，而决不是封建军阀官僚统治和听任帝国主义压迫的旧时代的纸上空谈了。
    我们并不讳言，在这过去三十年的时间历程中，中国的科学工作者，由于他们所处的社会条件的不同，也由于他们已经有了追求民主与科学双重要求的传统，他们比起工业发达的资本主义国家里面的科学工作者来，实在是更容易理解得到科学与政治的关系，以及更容易体会得出科学工作者的社会责任感，虽然他们的力量倒是比较薄弱的。在过去三十年的经验中，中国科学的研究，在困难重重的条件之下，也还有了它的一度发展；尤其是地域性科学如地质学、生物学和气象学等等，也收到了一部分的成就。但是，也就是这个经验，证明了蒋介石所代表的统治力量决不配担当发展中国的工业和科学的责任，且不说中国抵抗日本侵略的长期苦战中，这个统治力量宁可放纵贪污腐化的恶德横行中国，削弱了中国的健康力量的发育，旧有的微弱的科学事业的成果，听任它衰萎难振。这是举世共见的事情，而蒋介石统治集团却是只肯无赖地推诿给条件艰难，就以为可以交代得了他们的责任。我们试举其他的两件事例说我们的意思：一件是蒋介石的特务早在一九三一年就杀死了当时襄助蔡元培先生主持中国最重要的科学研究机关的有能力的机械工程学家杨杏佛先生，理由只为了杨先生曾经参与了保障人权的运动。这个时候还是中国资产阶级和帝国主义者盛赞蒋介石的“政绩”的时期，而杨先生则是一位对美国颇有感情，又是创建中国科学社的发起人之一，而且是多年推动科学事业的人才。另一件事是创办中国化学工业与主持中国工业化学研究最著有卓绝的成就的范旭东先生事业的受到阻挠：他以毕生三十年的努力，不乞求腐败政府力量的帮助，在曲折的道路上创立并发展他的事业，赢得了国内与国际的交口称誉。抗日战争将告胜利前夕，他远去美国，向那里的进出口银行以独立自主的立场，商借到一千六百万美元的借款作为恢复并扩展他的事业的资金。结果这件事却受到蒋介石政府的阻挠：理由是这个政府宁愿接受美国垄断资本家的计划，听任他们的剩余的化学工厂移到中国来迫害中国的民族工业。结果范先生为此就在一九四五年十月郁死于重庆。这两件具体事例足够从科学事业的立场上说明蒋介石政权的反动倒退的性质，不惜与科学为敌；自然更不必说它如何出卖国家主权，出卖人民利益，听任美国垄断资本家集团的操纵，与世界和平和世界人民为敌了。
    中国科学工作者非常激动于第二次世界大战以后全世界有正义感的科学工作者的普遍觉醒，理解到自身的社会责任，加强同业人的组织与团结，拒绝参加科学为少数人利益服务与人民为敌的一切企图，在世界和平与人民发展遭受新的威胁的今天，更不断的发出他们的抗议与力量。这说明了人民时代的跃进，科学工作者自觉地加进一份力量，必能对于扭转帝国主义者残暴狂纵的逆流，稳定世界和平，增强全世界人民兄弟的友谊的伟大理想与目标上，尽到有效的贡献。我们应当向苏联的科学工作者树立的工作榜样看齐，集体地，有计划地，谐和地善尽自己的力量，毋负历代交给我们这一代科学工作者的责任。
    我们特借今天这对于中国科学工作者特别有纪念意义的节日，向全国和全世界的科学工作者申述如上的愿望和信心。
    全世界进步的科学工作者加强团结起来，为了消灭帝国主义危害全人类历史进程的罪行而奋斗！        
        一九四九年五月四日、北平。
