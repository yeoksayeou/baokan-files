Overview of Primary and Secondary Education in the North China Region

I. Secondary Education

(1) The secondary education in the North China Region was constantly established and developed in the cruel war environment from the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. By the time of Japan's surrender, there were 34 secondary schools in the region, with a total of 6,339 students. After Japan's surrender, secondary education developed significantly. According to statistics from January 1946, the number of middle schools and normal schools in the original Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region had increased to 56, and the number of provincial secondary schools in the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region had developed to 50. In the past two or three years, due to the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the entire territory of North China was liberated, and land reform in the vast rural areas had been basically completed. A large number of children of working people poured into schools to study, and secondary education has achieved unprecedented development. According to current statistics: in the eight administrative regions of the region and the three cities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang, there are a total of 79 provincial and municipal middle schools, 10 vocational schools, and 23 normal schools, totaling 112 provincial and municipal secondary schools, 942 classes, and 45,319 students. There are 127 county normal schools, 256 classes, and 11,742 students. There are 20 county middle schools, 125 classes, and 6,296 students (county middle schools only include Jinzhong, Jidong, and Ji-Lu-Yu districts). In addition, there are 140 private secondary schools in Beiping, Tianjin, Jinzhong, and Jidong, with 1,086 classes and more than 65,000 students. In total, there are more than 390 secondary schools, more than 2,400 classes, and more than 128,500 students in the entire North China Region. Compared with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the number of schools has increased by about 12 times, and the number of students has increased by about 20 times. In the past three years, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of production and construction, short-term middle schools or training classes have been adopted to train and cultivate 36,268 young intellectuals to participate in the work of government, finance, culture and education, military affairs, transportation, and postal and telecommunications departments in an economical and effective manner. They have played a significant role in the National People's Liberation War and various undertakings.

(2) In order to solve the difficulties of poor young people in attending school, the government, even under the conditions of wartime financial difficulties, still did its best to subsidize poor young people to attend school. Last year, in Jin-Cha-Ji, among the 6,839 students in 28 middle schools, 3,347 were on public funding. In the 1949 budget, it was stipulated that the quota for publicly funded middle school students would be 55% in rural areas, 35% in medium-sized cities, and 70% for normal school students. Appropriately applied according to the economic conditions of students' families, the studies of poor students in school can be fully guaranteed. According to statistics from August 1948, among 7,811 students in 24 middle schools, 2,474 were children of poor peasants, accounting for 31.7%; 4,046 were children of middle peasants, accounting for 52%; 463 were children of rich peasants, accounting for 5.3%; and 298 were children of landlords, accounting for only 4%. The others accounted for about 7%. This is similar to the population ratio of various classes in rural areas. This proves that secondary schools in the North China Region have become schools for the general public, rather than the privilege of a few. In the newly liberated cities, according to the same spirit, appropriate subsidies are given to those who are truly poor or have lost contact with their families, so that they do not drop out of school.

(3) In order to strive for equal educational opportunities for men and women, all secondary schools pay attention to facilitating female students' enrollment and take care of them in terms of academic level and age restrictions. Currently, in the old liberated areas of North China, female students in secondary schools account for about 20% to 30% of the total number of students. This is also a phenomenon that did not exist in the past.

(4) With the changes in the situation in North China, in order to adapt to the needs of consolidating and building North China and supporting the Liberation War, since last autumn, secondary schools throughout the region have generally carried out rectification and construction work. The school system and curriculum have been unified, cultural studies have been strengthened, and political and ideological education has been improved. School buildings have been repaired, teaching equipment has been enriched, and books and instruments have been added. In the budget of middle schools in the old and semi-old liberated areas, in addition to the regular public miscellaneous expenses of more than 4.7 million catties of millet, an additional 1.345 million catties were allocated for the purchase of books and instruments. After the liberation of Pingjin, a large number of books and instruments were purchased in Taihang, Jizhong, Shijiazhuang and other places. As a result, faculty and staff worked more actively, organized various professional research groups, improved teaching methods, and students' learning enthusiasm was high, and teaching effectiveness was significantly improved. Gradually moving towards regularization.

(5) With the successive liberation of major cities such as Beiping and Tianjin, a large number of secondary schools were liberated from the oppression of enemy and puppet rule. Under the principle of ensuring that students do not drop out of school and teachers do not lose their jobs, the original schools were generally maintained. Faculty and staff who were not the main culprits and were willing to continue serving the people were generally retained in their original positions. Special agent traces in schools, reactionary education systems were abolished, and reactionary military training and civic courses were abolished, replaced by scientific and democratic education systems and revolutionary political and ideological education courses. Most teachers voluntarily participated in teacher unions to participate in democratic political activities and strengthen their own learning. Students in various schools have organized student unions to lead students in various learning and recreational activities. Administratively, according to the needs of the students, the subsidy for poor students is being democratically assessed by means of self-reporting and public deliberation and administrative approval. A large number of new books and newspapers have been added to the schools. Many schools have one newspaper per class, and all schools have increased the purchase of progressive books. Before liberation, a large number of students from Pingjin who were refugees and out of school were properly resettled by the People's Government. A total of 12,702 refugee students in Beiping were sent back to their hometowns to resume their studies, 5,854 took the entrance examination for China University and other schools, 3,390 studied or were employed in Beiping, and more than 3,000. As for the tens of thousands of young people in major middle schools and universities in Pingjin and other cities who applied for China University, Revolutionary University, Military University, and the southbound work group, they have not yet been counted.

Since the liberation of Pingjin, secondary education has been progressing rapidly in February and March, and is continuing to seek improvement. Problems such as funding, treatment of publicly funded students, school system, and curriculum standards are being studied for further improvement, and faculty and staff are launching revolutionary theory and professional learning to transform themselves. Students are correcting their learning viewpoints and methods. Secondary education in the newly liberated cities has shown a new atmosphere.

II. Elementary Education

(1) After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there were 1,410 higher primary schools with 130,285 students; and 60,849 junior primary schools with 3,267,288 students in the North China Region. By July 1946, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, invading some of our cities and villages, burning, killing, robbing, arresting people and conscripting soldiers, not only directly destroying many primary schools, but also indirectly affecting children's opportunities to study, resulting in a great reduction in primary schools and students. By the autumn of 1948, due to the victory of the People's Liberation War and the basic entry of the entire North China region into a peaceful environment, the vast rural areas had basically completed land reform, and the masses had turned over economically and politically, and urgently demanded culture. The entire North China region universally carried out the adjustment of cadres, improved the administrative leadership institutions at all levels, convened primary education conferences, formulated plans and programs, mobilized intellectuals in the countryside to participate in education work, trained and inspected primary school teachers, and appropriately improved the treatment of primary school teachers. By the end of the year, primary schools throughout the region had been restored and rectified, and about 30% of the primary schools gradually became regularized. The number of primary schools and students has increased. For example: in Jizhong last year after the wheat harvest holiday, statistics from 41 counties showed that there were 673 higher primary schools with 57,181 students, and 7,190 junior primary schools with 443,964 students, an increase of 1,353 primary schools and 18,116 students compared with before the wheat harvest holiday. In Taiyue in winter, there were 92 higher primary schools with 11,280 students; and 5,207 junior primary schools with 221,515 students. An increase of 161 primary schools and 13,402 students compared with before autumn. In the three special districts of Chahar, there were 107 more primary schools and 3,494 students than before land reform. This spring, due to the unified financial planning and expenditure and the rectification of primary schools, the number of primary schools in some areas has decreased. Currently, in the old and semi-old liberated areas, according to incomplete statistics (missing 7 counties and cities in Jidong, the entire area of Suiyuan-Mongolia, the 10th special district of Jizhong, the new area of Taihang, the 5 counties of Ji-Lu-Yu, and the new area of Chahar), there are a total of 2,282 higher primary schools and 47,862 junior primary schools in North China, totaling 50,144. There are 291,153 higher primary school students and 2,588,786 junior primary school students, totaling 2,879,939.

(2) In the restoration and rectification, class placement tests were universally conducted, which facilitated regular teaching, and established systems such as asking for leave and testing, as well as life covenants. The habit of studying diligently and consciously abiding by discipline has greatly improved. Some held movements to respect teachers and love students, strengthening the unity of teachers and students. Teachers immersed themselves in work with the spirit of tireless teaching, and actively studied culture and intensified business research. In many places, primary school teachers not only proposed "not teaching unprepared lessons", but also organized visits and research on new compound teaching methods.

Due to strengthening the study of culture and emphasizing classroom teaching, children study with extra intensity. The number of boarding students in Taihang and Taiyue has greatly increased, and academic performance has achieved rapid progress. Parents, upon receiving notification of their children's academic performance or visiting student achievement exhibitions, exclaimed in joy, "I never thought there would be such good results." Some proudly said, "It's not for nothing that we ate millet!" They bought new clothes and hats for their children, instructing them to "study even harder!" Some parents automatically mobilized six children to enroll in school at once, and some village cadres went to the school once a day, saying, "I always feel bad if I don't see the children." Some voluntarily repaired the schoolyard walls, stoves, doors and windows, and lent tables, chairs and benches.

Leaders at all levels have also strengthened supervision work. Some organized education section chiefs, supervisors, primary school principals, and teachers to conduct mass inspections, and sent special personnel to conduct typical investigations and research in depth, giving a strong impetus to primary education.

(3) The primary schools in the newly liberated cities, like the secondary schools, have rapidly resumed classes after liberation due to the correct implementation of the cultural and educational policies in the newly liberated areas, and the number of schools has also increased. For example, Beiping City now has a total of 366 public and private primary schools (235 public and 131 private), an increase of 13 compared to before liberation, with a total of 100,946 students. Tianjin City has a total of 325 public and private primary schools (120 public and 205 private), an increase of 6 compared to before liberation, with a total of 100,236 students. Teachers are eagerly seeking progress, intensifying political learning and striving to improve their professional skills. In their work, they not only do a good job in classroom teaching, but also can guide students' extracurricular activities, and they all say, "I can't work hard enough to live up to the people!" On the student side, a "Three Loves" (love the country, love learning, love labor) movement was also launched, using blackboards to conduct criticism and self-criticism.

    华北区中小学教育概况
    一、中等教育
    （一）华北区的中等教育，从抗日战争初期，就在残酷的战争环境中不断的创设与发展。至日本投降时，全区共有中等学校三十四处，学生共六千三百三十九人。日本投降后，中等教育有显著发展。据一九四六年一月统计，原晋察冀边区中学师范即增至五十六处，原晋冀鲁豫边区只省立中等学校，就发展到五十处。两三年来，由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，华北全境解放，广大农村土地改革已基本完成，劳动人民子弟，大量涌入学校学习，中等教育又得到空前的发展。据目前统计：全区八个行政区及北平、天津、石家庄三个市共有省市立中学七十九处，职业学校十处，师范二十三处，总计省市立中等学校一百一十二处，九百四十二班，学生四万五千三百一十九人。县立师范一百二十七处，二百五十六班，学生一万一千七百四二十人。县立中学二十处，一百二十五班，学生六千二百九十六人（县立中学只包括晋中、冀东、冀鲁豫三区）。又北平、天津、晋中、冀东共有私立中等学校一百四十处，一千零八十六班，学生六万五千余人，总计全华北区共有中等学校三百九十余处，二千四百余班，学生十二万八千五百余人，与抗日战争胜利相较，学校约增加十二倍，学生约增加二十倍之多。三年以来，为了适应生产建设的急需，采取了短期中学或训练班的方式，以经济有效的办法，训练培养了三六、二六八名知识青年参加到政府、财政、文教、军事、交通、邮电各部门去工作。他们对全国人民解放战争及各项事业起了很大的作用。
    （二）为了解决贫苦青年入学的困难，政府虽在战时财政困难的条件下，仍尽最大可能补助贫苦青年就学。去年晋察冀二十八处中学，六千八百三十九名学生的统计，公费即达三千三百四十七名。一九四九年经费预算中，规定中学公费生名额，乡村百分之五十五，中等城市百分之三十五，师范生百分之七十，按学生家庭经济情况适当运用，可使在校学生贫穷者之学习完全获得保障。就一九四八年八月，二十四处中学统计七千八百一十一名学生中，贫农子弟二千四百七十四人占百分之三十一点七；中农子弟四千零四十六人，占百分之五十二；富农子弟四百六十三人，占百分之五点三；地主子弟二百九十八人，仅占百分之四。其他的约百分之七。和农村各阶层人口比例差不多。可以证明华北区的中等学校已成为人民大众的学校，而不是少数人的特权了。在新解放城市，也根据同样精神，凡是真正贫苦的或与家庭失掉联系的，都予适当补助，不使失学。
    （三）为了争取男女教育机会均等，所有中等学校注意给女子入学以方便，在程度及年龄限制上，都予以照顾。现在全华北老区，中等学校女生，约占学生总数百分之二十到三十。这也是过去所没有的现象。
    （四）随着华北形势的变化，适应巩固与建设华北，支援解放战争的需要，去秋以来，全区中等学校，普遍进行了整顿建设工作。统一了学制、课程，加强了文化学习、改进了政治思想教育。修建校舍，充实教学设备，添购图书仪器。在老区半老区中等学校预算中除四百七十万余斤小米的经常公杂费外，另增图书仪器购置费一百三十四万五千余斤。平津解放后，太行、冀中、石家庄等处购置了大批图书仪器。因而教职员工作更加积极，组织各种业务研究小组，改进教学方法，学生学习情绪高涨，教学效果有显著提高。逐步走向正规化。
    （五）北平、天津等各大城市相继解放，大量中等学校从敌伪统治压迫下解放出来，在学生不失学，教师不失业的原则下，一般维持了原校。教职员只要不是首恶份子，且愿为人民服务继续留任者，一般原职不动。学校中特务＠①迹，废除了反动的教育制度，取消了反动的军训及公民课程，代之以科学民主的教育制度与革命的政治思想教育课程。多数教师为参加民主政治活动与加强自己的学习，自动参加了教师联合会。各校学生都组织了学生会，领导学生进行各种学习及文娱活动。行政上正在根据学生需要，用自报公义行政上批准的方法，民主评定对贫苦学生的补助金。各校添置了大批新书报，许多学校，每班有一份报纸，每校都增购了进步书籍。解放前大批流亡平津学生，流离失学，人民政府都已给予妥善安置，北平市流亡学生共一万二千七百零二人，遣送回籍复学者五千八百五十四人，报考华大及其他学校者三千三百九十人，在平就学或就业者三千余人。至于平津等市各大中学校报考华大、革大、军大、及南下工作团的数万青年尚未计在内。
    平津解放以来三、二月中，中等教育在迅速进步着，并在继续求改进提高。对经费、公费生待遇、学制、课程标准等问题，正在研究进一步改进办法，教职员正在为改造自己展开革命理论与业务的学习。学生在端正着学习观点与方法。新解放城市中等教育已呈现出新的气象。
    二、小学教育
    （一）华北区的小学教育，在抗日战争胜利以后，计有高小一千四百一十处，学生十三万零二百八十五人；初小六万零八百四十九处，学生三百二十六万七千二百八十八人。至一九四六年七月，蒋匪发动反人民内战，侵占我一些城市和乡村，烧杀抢掠捕人抓丁，不仅直接破坏了许多小学，也间接的影响了治儿童求学机会，以至小学及学生大大减少。至一九四八年秋由于人民解放战争的胜利及华北全区亦基本上进入和平环境，广大农村基本结束了土改，群众在经济上政上得到了翻身，迫切的要求文化。华北全区自七月即普遍地进行了调整干部、健全各级行政领导机构、召开小学教育会议、制订计划、方案、动员在乡知识分子，参加教育工作，训练与检定小学教师，适当的改善小学教师待遇，截至年底全区小学均进行了恢复与整顿，约有百分之三十以上的小学逐步的走向正规。小学及学生人数均有增加。如：冀中去年麦假后，四十一县统计：共有高小六百七十三处，学生五万七千一百八十一人，初小七千一百九十处，学生四十四万三千九百六十四人，较麦假前增加小学一千三百五十三处，学生一万八千一百一十六人。太岳冬季共有高小九十二处，学生一万一千二百八十人；初小五千二百零七处，学生二十二万一千五百一十五十。较秋前增加小学一百六十一处，学生一万三千四百二人四人。察哈尔三专区较土改前增加小学一百零七处，学生三千四百九十四人。今春因财政统筹统支及整顿小学，个别地区小学有些减少。目前老区半老区，据不完全的统计（缺冀东七个县市、绥蒙全区、冀中十专区、太行新区、冀鲁豫五县、察哈尔新区。）华北共有高小二千二百八十二处，初小四万七千八百六十二处，合计五万零一百四十四处。高小学生二十九万一千一百五十三人，初小学生二百五十八万八千七百八十六人，合计二百八十七万九千九百三十九人。
    （二）在恢复整顿中普遍的进行了编班测验，便利了正规教学，建立了请假、测验等制度，以及生活公约。勤于学习，自觉遵守纪律的习惯大有进步。有的举行了敬师爱生运动，加强了师生的团结。教师们以诲人不倦的精神埋头工作，并积极的学习文化、加紧业务的研究，许多地方的小学教员不仅提出了“不上无准备的课”，而且组织参观、研究新的复式教学法。
    由于加强学习文化，重视课堂教学，儿童学习格外紧张。太行太岳夜宿生大大增加，学习成绩获得飞跃的进步，学生家长见到自己孩子学习成绩的通知，或者参观了学生成绩展览会，都惊欢的说：“想不到有这样好的成绩”。有的得意的说：“没白吃小米！”给孩子买套新衣帽，嘱咐他“可更要好好学习！”有的家长自动的一气动员六个儿童入学，有的村干部每天要到校去一遭说：“不看看孩子们总觉过意不去。”有的自己贴工修理学校院墙炉灶门窗，借给棹椅板凳。
    各级的领导上也加强了视导工作，有的组织教育科长督学小学校长教员，进行群众性的检查，并派专人深入一点进行典型调查研究工作，给予小学教育以有力的推动。
    （三）新解放城市的小学，和中等学校同样由于正确执行了新解放区文教政策的结果，解放后均迅速的恢复上课，学校且有增加，如北平市现共有公私立小学三六六处（公立二百三十五处，私立一百三十一处）较解放前增加十三处，学生共有十万零九千四百六十人。天津市共有公私立小学三百二十五处（公立一百二十处，私立二百零五处）较解放前增加六处，学生共有十万零二千三百三十六人。教师们迫切的要求进步，加紧政治学习并努力研究改进业务，在工作上不但做好课堂教学，且能辅导学生课外活动，都说：“不好好工作，对不起人民！”在学生方面，也展开了“三爱”，（爱国家、爱学习、爱劳动）运动，利用黑板报进行批评与自我批评。
