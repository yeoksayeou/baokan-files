Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS, Paris—The French Communist Party Politburo meeting issued a communiqué stating: Although the government fabricated claims of satisfactory financial conditions on the eve of the general election, France's financial situation is steadily deteriorating. The Marshall Plan aims to make France politically subordinate to American imperialism, resulting in economic decline, unemployment, and decreased wage purchasing power. The inevitable consequence of the Marshall Plan is the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty and its European branches (the Brussels Treaty and the Western European Union). This plan has led to a significant increase in military spending, imposing a heavy burden on the French economy and the living standards of the working people. Under this policy of impoverishment, more and more workers have united their forces to defend their legitimate demands. The Politburo calls on party members and party organizations to actively participate in the struggle to meet the demands of the working masses, reduce military spending, immediately stop the war in Vietnam, and protest the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, which prepares for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union.
The Politburo protests the government's illegal arrest of active participants in the Resistance movement. The Politburo welcomes the protests made by Resistance movement groups against the release of the traitor Pétain and the currently planned amnesty for pro-Japanese traitors. The Politburo exposes the persecution of Bonté, Casan, and Duclos to all republican elements in the country. The Politburo urges the working people and democrats to launch a broad protest movement against the government's policy of suppressing the Communist Party.

　　法共政治局发表公报
  　反对法国依附美帝
    号召党员维护劳动人民权利
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法共政治局会议发表公报说：虽然在总选前夕政府曾捏造说财政情形令人满意，法国的财政情形却正每况愈下。马歇尔计划的目的在使法国在政治上附属于美帝国主义，结果招致了经济衰落，失业和工资购买力的下降。马歇尔计划的当然后果是北大西洋公约的签订和其欧洲分支（布鲁塞尔条约和西欧联盟）的建立。这一计划引起了军费的大大增加，使法国经济和劳动人民生活水平遭受沉重负担。在这种贫困政策之下，越来越多的工人已团结起他们的力量，来维护合法要求。政治局号召党员和党的组织积极参加斗争，争取满足劳动群众的要求，削减军费，立即停止越南战争，并抗议批准准备侵苏战争的北大西洋公约。
    政治局抗议政府非法逮捕抵抗运动的积极参加者。政治局对于抵抗运动团体为反对释放卖国贼贝当以及现正拟订中的赦免法奸的计划，所作的抗议，表示欢迎。政治局向国内一切共和分子揭穿对邦特、加善和杜克洛发动的迫害。政治局力促劳动人民和民主分子发动广大的抗议运动，反对政府镇压共产党的政策。
