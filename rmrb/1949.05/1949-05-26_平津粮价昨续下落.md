　　(Grain)
    Grain prices in Beijing and Tianjin continued to decline on the 25th. Most merchants were selling more than they were buying, and a wait-and-see attitude was increasingly prevalent. Among various food grains, fine grains experienced the largest declines. Refined flour was selling for 4,600 yuan, a further drop of 150 yuan compared to the 24th. Rice was at 102 yuan, down 10 yuan. Wheat and coarse grains fell by 3 to 5 yuan each. Grain prices in Tianjin continued to fall due to the large quantities of flour arriving from Jinan and Xuzhou in recent days, as well as the successive arrival of soybeans and coarse grains from Northeast China, Shanhaiguan, and Qinhuangdao. On the 25th, refined flour was 4,060 yuan, down 140 yuan; rice was 91 yuan, down 5 yuan; and wheat, millet, corn, etc., were down 2 to 3 yuan each.
    (Cotton Cloth)
    Cotton cloth prices in Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou all showed a consistent downward trend. On the 25th, the Erchang Hong Wufu (Second Factory Red Five Blessings) cloth in Beiping was 10,200 yuan, down 100 yuan; in Tianjin, it was 10,500 yuan, down 30 yuan; and in Zhangjiakou, it was 10,650 yuan, down 700 yuan.

　　平津粮价昨续下落
  　（粮食）
    平津二十五日粮价继续下落。各商售多购少，持观望态度者益显普遍。各种食粮中，以细粮下落较多，通粉妥价四千六百元，较二十四日续落一百五十元，大米一百零二元落十元，小麦、杂粮则跌三、五元不等。天津粮价由于连日由济南、徐州拥到大批面粉，东北、山海关、秦皇岛等地大豆杂粮亦相继抵津，故继续下落。二十五日通粉四千零六十元，落一百四十元，大米九十一元，落五元，小麦、小米、玉米等落二、三元不等。
    （棉布）
    平、津、张、三地棉布价格一致趋疲，二十五日北平二厂红五福一万零二百元跌一百元，天津一万零五百元跌三十元，张家口一万零六百五十元跌七百元。
