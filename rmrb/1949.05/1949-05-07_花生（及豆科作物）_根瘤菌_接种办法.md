    Peanut (and Legume) "Rhizobium" Inoculation Method
    Chen Shujun, Hu Jisheng, North China Agricultural Science Research Institute

    Many "nodules" grow on the roots of peanuts and legumes, which we call "root nodules." When peanuts are first born, a type of bacteria penetrates the roots; it grows and reproduces there, while stimulating the growth of root nodules, and is called "rhizobium bacteria." This rhizobium bacteria can absorb nitrogen from the air and fix it into nitrogen fertilizer, which it supplies to the peanut for growth. This research is a major contribution to agricultural technology, which is to select effective (with strong nitrogen-fixing ability) rhizobium strains, artificially culture them into inoculants, and when sowing, mix a very small amount of inoculant with water and mix it with peanut and bean seeds, and sow into the soil to ensure that the seeds are covered with a sufficient number of effective rhizobium bacteria. When the buds germinate roots, rhizobium bacteria can preferentially invade from the root hairs, stimulating root nodule formation and living symbiotically with legumes. When legumes are about to mature, they rupture and rot, and the rhizobium bacteria return to the soil in the root nodules, using the nitrogen in the organic matter to live as ordinary saprophytic bacteria, waiting to encounter the root hairs of newly germinated legume plants to re-invade and restore symbiosis. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute adopted the following two methods for inoculation experiments last year, and the results were very good, and are worth our study and promotion:

    1. Select effective rhizobium strains for cultivation, and then inoculate them onto peanuts. Only a small piece of inoculant and some water are needed to mix with six or seven catties of peanut seeds before sowing. This method is simple and easy to implement, and increases production significantly. This year, inoculation experiments have been designed in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xingtai, Linqing, Heze, Changli, Beijing and other seven locations. However, rhizobium inoculation can only solve the nitrogen fertilizer problem for legume crops; such as bean cake, ammonium sulfate need not be used anymore. If the soil is deficient in phosphorus, calcium, and potassium, appropriate supplementation should be provided. However, the soil in North China generally does not lack calcium and potassium, but in some areas such as Shijiazhuang and Dingxian, the supplementation of phosphate fertilizer (bone meal or calcium phosphate) should not be ignored.

    2. Soil mixing inoculation method, although not as effective as inoculants, still yields much higher than no inoculation, and the seeds are fuller and mature earlier. This year, with the expansion of peanut planting area, this method should be adopted when planting peanuts in new soil, that is, take about three or four dung baskets of the lower layer of soil (where the roots grow) from the land where peanuts, mung beans, red beans, or lespedeza were planted last year, and after sieving it, mix it with five or six catties of peanut seeds with water and sow. According to experiments, each mu of legumes can absorb six to twenty-five catties of nitrogen from the air per season, equivalent to about one hundred to four hundred catties of bean cake or thirty-three to one hundred and twenty-five catties of fertilizer powder (ammonium sulfate). However, it should be noted that the land from which the soil is taken must have had an excellent harvest and no pests or diseases.

    花生（及豆科作物）“根瘤菌”接种办法
    华北农业科学研究所  陈淑筠、胡济生
    在花生及豆科作物根部，长着许多“疙疸”，我们叫做“根瘤”。当花生初生时，有一种细菌钻进根部；在那里生长繁殖，同时刺激生根瘤，名为“根瘤细菌”。这种根瘤细菌能自空中摄取氮气，固定为氮素肥料，供给花生生长。这一研究对农业技术上有一个大贡献，就是选择有效的（固氮能力强的）根瘤菌种，用人工培养制成接种剂，当播种时，用极少量的接种剂掺水与花生及豆种拌匀，播入土中，保证种子上沾着充足数量的有效根瘤细菌即可。当初芽生根时，根瘤细菌可以优先自根毛侵入，刺激生根瘤与豆科作物营共生生活。豆科作物将近成熟时破裂腐烂，根瘤菌便回到土根中瘤，利用有机质中的氮素生活是为普通的腐生细菌，等遇到新生菌的菌科根毛再行侵入恢复共生。华北农业科学研究所去年采取以下两种办法进行接种试验，结果很好，值得我们研究推广：
    一、选择有效的根瘤菌种加以培养，再接种到花生上去，六、七斤花生种籽只，要一小块接种剂和一些水与种籽拌匀种下就可以了，每亩可增收百分之二十五到五十。这一办法简而易行，增产很多，今年在石家庄、保定，刑台、临清、菏泽、昌黎、北平等七处都分别设计了接种试验，但根瘤菌接种只能解决豆科作物的氮肥问题；如豆饼，硫酸ｙà＠①可不必再用，若土壤缺磷、钙、钾还应当有适当的补充。但华北地区的土壤，一般不缺少钙和钾，有些地区如石家庄、定县则不可忽略磷肥（骨粉或磷酸石灰）的补充。
    二、拌土接种法，虽然不及接种剂效果良好，但比起不接种的产量仍然高很多，而且籽粒丰满早熟，今年扩大种植花生面积，在新土种植花生宜采用此办法，即在上年种花生或绿豆或红豆或胡枝子的地里取下层（根部生长的地方）的土约三、四粪筐，用筛子筛过后与五、六斤花生种用水和匀播下，据试验每季每亩豆类可以自空中摄取氮量六斤至二十五斤，约相当豆饼一百斤至四百斤或肥田粉（硫酸铔）三十三斤至一百二十五斤，但应注意所取土的田地，须是曾有极好的收成，并且没有什么病虫害。
