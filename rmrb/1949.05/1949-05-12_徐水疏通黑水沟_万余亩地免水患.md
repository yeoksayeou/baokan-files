    Xushui Dredges the Blackwater Ditch
    Over Ten Thousand Mu of Land Spared from Flooding

    [Chahar News] The masses in ten villages including Nanbaita in Xushui County, under the leadership of county and district cadres, actively built dams, irrigated the land, and sowed seeds to combat drought. As of April 16th, over 12,000 mu of land (including wheat fields) had been irrigated. Currently, the masses in each village are actively sowing seeds and hoeing wheat. Furthermore, the Blackwater Ditch, which is thirty li in length, was blocked by the enemy and puppets for a long time in the past, causing the old riverbed to silt up, preventing water from flowing eastward. Thirteen villages, including Yueying, suffered from floods every year. Under the leadership of the county people's government, work began on April 8th, and within fifteen days, the dredging project of the Blackwater Ditch, which was one zhang wide, three to five chi deep, and thirty li long, was completed, saving 16,900 mu of land from flooding and increasing grain production by an estimated 1,600+ shi.

    徐水疏通黑水沟
    万余亩地免水患
    【察哈尔讯】徐水南白塔等十村群众，在县区干部领导下积极打坝浇地，抗旱播种。截至四月十六日止，已浇地一万二千余亩（麦地在内）。现各村群众正积极播种，锄麦。又全长三十里的黑水沟，因过去受敌伪长期封锁，旧河床淤塞，使水不能东流，岳营等十三村，每年都遭水灾。在该县人民政府领导下，从四月八日开始动工，在十五天内完成宽一丈、深三尺到五尺、长达三十里地的黑水沟疏浚工程，使一万六千九百亩地免除水患，约可增产粮食一千六百余石。
