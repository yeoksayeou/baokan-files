　　"If you don't carry water during the spring drought, you'll have a big pout in the fall!"
    Laishui and Boye Cadres Go to the Countryside to Lead Farmers in Drought Prevention and Planting
    [Chahar News] In order to break the farmers' mentality of waiting for rain and to plant in a timely manner, Laishui dispatched more than 60 county-level cadres to the countryside on April 25th, except for a very small number of people who insisted on departmental work, to actively lead farmers in carrying water for planting. The following intensive work for the half-month period from April 25th to May 10th has been determined: 1. Planting: Cadres personally take the lead and break the mentality of leaving things to fate. They put forward slogans such as "Plant fields early in leap years," "Relying on the heavens for food means being lazy," "If you don't carry water during the spring drought, you'll have a big pout in the fall," "One day late in spring is ten days late in autumn," and "Seeing the seedlings means a 30% harvest" to create a widespread mass movement for drought prevention and planting. Cadres and party members are called upon to personally take the lead. Attention must be paid to ensuring that the land of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents without labor is planted. 2. Organizing Famine Relief: According to inaccurate statistics for the entire county, there are currently 865 households with over 3,000 people who have nothing to eat. In addition to a portion of grain subsidized by the public, the focus is on organizing production and gathering wild vegetables and tree leaves to solve the spring and summer famine. 3. Substitute Farming Issues: In many villages, the evaluation of substitute farming is unfair, and the hardship and benefits are not evenly distributed. The county and district cadres going to the countryside this time must conduct in-depth and specific household inspections to provide fair and reasonable solutions. (Dong Chunxing)
    [Jizhong Telegraph] Under the emergency instructions of the Jizhong District Party Committee on drought prevention and planting, the Boye County Party Committee organized county and district cadres to go to the countryside to mobilize the masses to carry out drought prevention and planting. In mobilizing the masses, party members and active backbone elements played a leading role. After improving the masses' confidence in cotton planting, Chengdong Village in the Fourth District sold some of its superfluous property to buy 20 new water carts and 7,000 jin of cotton seeds. Party members and cadres also took the lead in organizing mutual aid. In digging wells for planting, the masses in many villages dug wells and watered the land day and night. In villages around Xiaodian and Nanchu in the Second District, lanterns were lit at night, and water carts were used to water the land. Beizhu Village organized the entire village's livestock and water carts to water the land in shifts day and night at 82 wells, while planting at the same time. Currently, 1,800 mu of white land has been watered, and part of it has been planted. According to statistics, in ten days, 21 villages in the Second and Fourth Districts organized a total of 254 temporary mutual aid groups, dug 76 earthen wells, and repaired and built 69 new and old wells. They repaired and manufactured 122 water carts, planted more than 400 mu of cotton using "yin keng" planting, and "yin" watered more than 8,700 mu of white land. The main reasons for the above achievements are: (1) Before going to the countryside to work, county and district cadres generally conducted self-criticism, and some strictly implemented self-criticism in their work, greatly overcoming the past lax and undisciplined life and work style, strengthening organization and discipline, and improving work efficiency. Those who often went home in the past did not go home, and some mobilized the masses and organized the masses to dig wells at night. (2) Many villages combined the work with party rectification, criticized and educated party members and cadres who were negative and irresponsible in their work, and commended those who were active in their work. After the organization was rectified, 17 villages in the five districts changed from being negative to being active. (3) Problems were discovered and solved in a timely manner: for example, when mobilizing the masses, it was discovered that the masses lacked seeds, and the Promotion Society immediately purchased and prepared a batch of cotton seeds from neighboring districts. It was also discovered that many wells were broken, so the masses were mobilized to repair them. According to statistics, 14 villages repaired 44 old wells and 16 brick wells. Nine earthen wells were dug, and 59 new water carts were repaired and manufactured.

　　“春旱不挑水、秋后大噘嘴！”
    涞水博野干部下乡领导农民防旱点种
    【察哈尔讯】涞水为打破农民等雨思想，及时下种，除留极少数人坚持部门工作外，六十余县级干部，于四月二十五日下乡，积极领导农民进行挑水点播。确定二十五日至五月十日半月时间的突击工作如下：一、播种：干部亲自下手领导，打破听天由命的思想，并提出“润月年早种田，”“靠天吃饭，就是懒汉”、“春旱不挑水，秋后大噘嘴”、“春晚一天秋晚十天”、“见苗三分收”等口号，造成广泛的群众性的防旱播种运动。并号召干部与党员，要亲自带头领导。注意没劳动力的烈军工属的地必须种上。二、组织渡荒：据全县不精确统计：现有八百六十五户三千多口人没有一点吃的。除公家一部补助粮外，着重于组织生产，打野菜树叶解决春荒与夏荒。三、代耕问题：有不少的村代耕评议不公苦乐不均，此次下乡县区干部要深入具体逐户检查，给予公平合理的解决。（董春兴）
    【冀中电】博野县委在冀中区党委防旱点种的紧急指示下，组织县区干部下乡，发动群众开展了防旱点种。在发动群众中，党员、积极骨干份子起了带头作用。四区城东村在提高群众种棉信心后，变卖了一部份浮财，买新水车二十辆，棉花籽种七千斤，党员干部并带头组织了互助。在挖井点种中不少村的群众，昼夜不停挖井浇地，二区小店、南出一带村庄，夜间点起灯笼，套起水车浇地。北祝村组织了全村畜力、水车，在八十二眼井上，昼夜轮班浇地，并一面播种，现已浇好白地千八百亩，部分已经播了种。据统计，十天中二、四区二十一个村，共组织起二百五十四个临时互助组，挖土井七十六个，修理及打新旧井六十九眼。修理购制水车一百二十二辆，阴坑点种棉花四百余亩，阴浇白地八千七百余亩。以上成绩获得之主要原因：（一）县区干部在下乡工作前，普遍进行检查思想，并有的在工作中严格执行了自互批评，大大克服了过去生活与工作松懈及散漫性，加强了组织纪律，提高了工作效能，过去常回家的不回家了，有的夜间动员群众组织群众挖井。（二）不少的村在工作中结合了整党，对工作消极不负责任的党员干部进行了批评教育，工作积极的进行了表扬。经过整顿组织后，五个区十七个村由工作消极转为积极。（三）及时发现问题解决问题：如在发动群众中，发现群众缺种籽，推进社即到邻区购备了一部棉籽，又发现坏的水井很多，即发动群众修理。据统计，十四个村修理旧井四十四眼，砖井十六眼。挖土井九个，修理与制买新水车五十九辆。
