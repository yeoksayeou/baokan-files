    Preventing Livestock Plague
    Taiyue Administrative Office Issues Urgent Circular
    [Taiyue Telegraph] Since the beginning of spring, livestock plague has been prevalent in some areas of our region. In Yangcheng's first district, from August of last year to February of this year, 197 cattle died in 26 villages over a five-month period. To eradicate the livestock plague, the Administrative Office has established a livestock epidemic prevention team, formulated an epidemic prevention plan, and established a livestock plague intelligence system. Yangcheng's districts have held veterinary research meetings, divided diagnosis areas, and conducted large-scale livestock inspections, stipulating that reports be submitted to the district once a month. Various localities have made considerable achievements in organizing veterinarians to carry out emergency treatment and prevention work. However, individual areas still neglect this work in leadership. For example, in the third district of Jincheng, 117 livestock have died in nine villages from September of last year to now. The villages have reported to the district, but the district has ignored it, neither reporting to the county nor trying to help the masses with treatment. In order to further strengthen the prevention and treatment of livestock plague, the Taiyue Administrative Office issued an urgent circular on April 29th, pointing out several issues that need to be resolved in the current prevention and treatment work: First, earnestly establish livestock administration, strictly enforce the isolation of sick livestock, deep burial of dead livestock, prohibit the sale of plague meat and plague hides, hides of plague livestock must be disinfected in lime water for three days before being allowed to be sold, livestock avoiding plague to other villages must be inspected to ensure they are not sick before being allowed to leave the village, sick livestock are prohibited from drinking water in public ponds, and violators should be given certain education and punishment, and actively mobilize and organize the masses to hire veterinarians to inspect livestock, strengthen maintenance and management of those without disease, those found to be sick should take preventive medicine, and those who are sick should immediately undergo emergency treatment. In this way, all localities must universally carry out publicity on the prevention and treatment of plague, stipulate necessary epidemic prevention covenants, promote mutual assistance in medical treatment to rescue emergencies and eliminate plague, and create a mass epidemic prevention movement. Second, immediately mobilize existing veterinarians, conduct identification by county or district, issue medical practice certificates, establish livestock epidemic prevention research associations, respect veterinarians, pay according to labor, do not unilaterally require doctors to serve the masses, and at the same time educate doctors to actively eradicate epidemics and serve the masses, overcoming the past style of "treating urgent illnesses slowly." Third, the focus of work should be on how to prevent it currently. If it has already occurred in some areas, immediately hire veterinary teams or epidemic prevention teams to carry out surprise treatment to avoid delays. Preventing livestock plague should become a regular task for all localities.

    防治畜瘟
    太岳行署发出紧急通报
    【太岳电】入春以来，畜瘟在我区部分地区流行。阳城一区去年八月到今年二月五个月中，二十六个村死牛一百九十七只。为扑灭畜瘟，行署建立了家畜防疫队，制定了防疫计划，建立了畜瘟情报制度。阳城各区曾开兽医研究会，划分诊断区，进行牲畜大检查，规定一月向区报告一次。各地在组织兽医进行紧急治疗与防止工作上，都做出不少成绩。但也仍有个别地区领导上忽视这一工作。如晋城三区九个村自去年九月到现在，病死牲口一百一十七个，村已报告区，而区却置之不理，既未向县报告，亦未设法帮助群众医治。为进一步加强防止畜瘟与治疗工作，太岳行政公署特于四月二十九日发出紧急通报：指出目前在防止畜瘟与治疗工作中，要贯彻解决的几个问题：第一、认真建立畜政，严令实行病畜的隔离，死畜深埋，禁卖瘟肉瘟皮，剥下瘟牲口的皮必须立即在石灰水内消毒三天方准出卖，到别村避瘟之牲口，必需检查无病才准出村，病畜禁止到公共池饮水，违者应给予一定的教育与处分，并积极动员与组织群众聘请兽医检查牲口，无病者加强保养管理，已发现病的应吃预防药，有病者应立即施行紧急治疗。如此，各地必须普遍展开防治病瘟的宣传，规定必要的防疫公约，提倡医病互助救急灭瘟，造成群众性的防疫运动。第二、立即动员现有兽医，以县或区进行鉴定，发给行医证书，成立家畜防疫研究会，尊重兽医，按劳给酬，不要单方面要求医生为群众服务，同时要教育医生积极扑灭瘟疫为群众服务，克服过去“紧病慢大夫”的作风。第三、工作重点应放在目前如何防止，某些地区已经发生，立即聘请兽医组或防疫小组进行突击治疗，勿使拖延。预防畜瘟应成为各地经常工作。
