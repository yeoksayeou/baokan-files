Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: Moscow dispatch: The Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the Soviet Union recently held a meeting here to discuss the three-year plan recently adopted by the government regarding the development of livestock breeding in collective farms and state-owned farms. Among those attending the meeting were prominent scientists and agricultural scientists, Academician Lysenko, Marshal Budyonny of the Soviet Union, staff members of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy and various scientific research institutes, livestock experts, and veterinarians. Academician Lysenko delivered a report on the tasks of agricultural scientific research institutes in fulfilling the plan for the development of livestock breeding. He said: The Soviet Union has achieved great success in improving grain cultivation and created the prerequisites for further increasing grain production. The planned implementation of pasture and crop rotation systems, the planting of forests in grassland areas, and the increase in fertilizers and machinery supplied by the state to collective farms and state-owned farms are further proof of the inherent unlimited potential of socialist agriculture. Today, agricultural workers have made it their task to maximize the development of livestock breeding. Soviet livestock breeding suffered significant losses due to the temporary occupation of vast livestock areas by Germany during the war. Now, the livestock industry must not only recover to pre-war levels within three years, but also surpass it. The state's plan stipulates that livestock numbers and livestock product productivity should be increased to such an extent that the production of dairy products, meat, butter, wool, and leather will be doubled or one and a half times in a short period, in order to supply the people and industry with abundant products. The realization of this decision will increase the income of collective farms and increase their wealth. The government has also set huge tasks for scientists. Soviet science and livestock breeding work have achieved great success, and many new breeds of livestock have been bred, and methods for improving pasture grasslands have been obtained. Scientists will now focus on applying these achievements in collective farms and state-owned farms. To this end, scientists must work closely with collective farmers. Lysenko detailed scientific methods for increasing the productivity of livestock products, and cited many examples of collective farms and state-owned farms producing large quantities of dairy products, butter, wool, meat, and leather. The meeting then discussed the issues raised in Lysenko's report.

    列宁农业科学院讨论增殖牲畜
    科学家同农民紧密结合
    【新华社北平十一日电】莫斯科讯：列宁农业科学院会议于日前在此间举行，讨论最近政府所通过的关于发展集体农场和国营农场牲畜饲养的三年计划。出席会议的有著名科学家和农业学家科学院会员李森科，苏联元帅布琼尼，季米里雅采夫农业科学院和各科学研究所的工作人员，牲畜专家及兽医等。科学院会员李森科发表关于农业科学研究所在履行发展牲畜饲养计划中的任务的报告。他说：苏联在改进谷物耕作方面已得到了巨大的成就并创造了进一步增加谷物生产的先决条件，有计划地实行牧草与作物轮种制，在草原地区种植森林，增加国家供给集体农场和国营农场的肥料和机器，是社会主义农业所固有的无限潜在力的又一证明。今天，农业工作者已把最大限度地发展牲畜饲养作为他们的任务。苏联牲畜饲养由于战争中德国暂时占领了广大的养畜区的结果，而蒙受了重大的损失。现在。牲畜业不仅必须在三年内回复战前的水平，并且要超过它。国家的计划规定要增加牲畜头数和养畜业产物生产率到这种程度，以便在短时期内乳品、肉类、牛油、羊毛、皮革的生产增加一倍和一倍半，而以丰富的产物供应人民和工业之需。这一决定如告实现，将增加集体农场的收入和增加它们的财富。政府也对科学家提出了巨大的任务。苏联科学和牲畜饲养工作已获得了巨大成就，有许多新的种畜已被培育出来，并且已得到了改进牧场草地的方法。科学家现将集中注意于在集体农场和国营农场应用这些成就。为此，科学家必须与集体农民紧密地合作。李森科详述增加养畜业产物生产率的科学方法，并举出集体农场和国营农场大量出产乳品、牛油、羊毛、肉类和皮革的许多例子。会议接着讨论李森科报告中所提出的问题。
