Taiyue Telegram: The Taiyue District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued the following instructions regarding the rescue of frost-stricken areas in northern Yue: On the 13th and 14th of this month, the weather suddenly turned cold, and various counties in northern Yue suffered widespread frost damage, with Qin Yuan and Anze being the most severely affected. The river water froze to a thickness of more than two fingers. In severely affected villages, the autumn seedlings and wheat seedlings were completely or largely killed. Such frost damage is unprecedented in recent years, causing serious damage to this year's wheat harvest and autumn seedlings. Disaster areas should take advantage of the remaining summer planting season to quickly destroy and replant the frost-damaged autumn seedling and wheat fields. To this end: (1) All affected counties should immediately suspend other work and convene an emergency mobilization meeting of all party, government, military, and civilian cadres overnight to discuss and study specific measures to rescue frost-stricken areas, destroy and replant autumn seedling and wheat fields, and this should be regarded as the only central task at present. All levels of organs should also organize manpower and livestock to practically help the masses destroy and replant. (2) Organize men, women, old and young, and urgently mobilize to rescue frost-stricken areas, carry out replanting and destruction, and overcome pessimistic, disappointed, and hesitant thoughts. If immediate destruction and replanting are carried out according to the season and the degree of frost damage, a harvest in the autumn is still possible. In areas where it is too dry to plow and plant, spot planting and seed planting should be carried out without waiting for rain, so as not to delay the season. (3) Call on the masses to help each other and provide mutual assistance, with unaffected areas helping affected areas, lightly affected areas helping severely affected areas, and areas with fewer difficulties helping areas with more difficulties, in order to solve difficulties such as seeds, fertilizers, manpower, and livestock. In areas where wheat seedlings need to be destroyed and the masses have difficulty with fertilizer, banks can lend a portion of funds to buy bean cakes, sesame cakes, etc. (4) According to the season and land conditions, if large corn can be planted, it should be planted immediately; if not, small corn, late millet, and sorghum should be planted. (5) Party committees at all levels should seize the opportunity, and responsible persons should personally go to the disaster-stricken areas to mobilize and help the masses with replanting. All organ cadres, except for a few who remain behind, should go to the countryside to strive to complete the urgent task of destruction and replanting.

　　太岳区党委紧急指示：毁种补种抢救冻灾
    【太岳电】中共太岳区党委关于抢救岳北等地冻灾，特发指示略如下：本月十三、十四两日，气候骤冷，岳北各县普遭冻灾，以沁源、安泽为最严重。河水结冰二指有余，严重的村庄秋苗、麦苗全部或大部冻死。此种冻灾为历年来所未有，致使今年麦收秋苗遭受严重损伤。灾区应趁仍可夏种季节，赶快毁种补种被冻的秋苗麦田。为此（一）凡受灾县份应立即停止其他工作，连夜召开全体党政军民干部的紧急动员大会，讨论研究抢救冻灾毁种补种秋苗麦田的具体办法，并应作为当前的唯一中心工作。各级机关并应组织人力牲畜实际帮助群众毁种补种。（二）组织男女老少，紧急动员起来抢救冻灾，进行补种毁种，克服悲观失望和消极犹疑的思想。如能立即根据季节与受冻程度毁种补种，秋收仍然有望，天旱不能犁种地区，即进行点种，寄种，勿待天雨，迟误季节。（三）号召群众互助互济，未受灾的帮助受灾的，轻的帮助重的，困难少的帮助困难多的，以解决种籽、肥料、人力、牲口等困难。须要毁种麦苗地区而群众肥料困难的，银行可贷一部款买豆饼、麻饼等。（四）根据季节与土地条件，能种大玉茭的即抢种大玉茭，不能的即种小玉茭、晚谷子、黍子等。（五）各级党委应抓紧时机，负责人要亲赴受灾地区动员帮助群众抢种。机关干部除留少数外，应全部下乡为完成毁种补种的紧急任务而努力。
