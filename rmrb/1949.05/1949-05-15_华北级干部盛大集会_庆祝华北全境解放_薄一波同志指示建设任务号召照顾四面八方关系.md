    [Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] More than 4,000 North China-level cadres in Peiping held a celebratory evening gathering at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall yesterday (the 14th) to celebrate the liberation of all of North China and welcome the nationwide victory. Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Dong Biwu and Lan Gongwu, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the North China People's Government, and Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the North China Military Region, attended and delivered speeches, putting forward new tasks and instructions for North China in the new situation.
    Comrade Bo Yibo first explained that North China has completely transitioned from a war environment to a peaceful construction environment. The overriding central task of North China from now on is to restore and develop production. We have won or are about to win a complete victory in the war. As Chairman Mao has instructed us, this victory is great, but compared with the long-term construction tasks ahead, this is only the first step in a long march. I hope everyone will always remember Chairman Mao's instructions to us. Then he briefly expounded on Chairman Mao's instructions regarding the construction line, saying that all work must take into account the relationship between labor and capital, public and private, urban and rural areas, and domestic and foreign affairs. A serious mistake will be made if one aspect is not handled well. Secondly, he said that it is necessary to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and to resolutely unite with workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and the liberal bourgeoisie to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.
    Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, said that North China's complete victory was due to the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army and the support of the vast people in production. After the victory, we must quickly carry out comprehensive construction work. Now we must first build a new North China. Although there are still many difficulties in the future of construction, the Chinese people are diligent, brave, and enduring. We will not bow to difficulties, and we will be victorious.
    Commander Nie Rongzhen of the North China Military Region spoke amid warm applause. He said that thanks to the coordination of the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army, North China was completely liberated very smoothly. Central China, South China, and even the last and largest stronghold of imperialism in China—Shanghai—will soon be liberated. He also said that after liberation, it is necessary to further consolidate the victory and security of North China so that the people can carry out production with peace of mind, and the remaining counter-revolutionary forces must be thoroughly eliminated. Construction work is just beginning, and we should not be complacent, but should study construction work well. He also paid tribute to the North China soldiers who had fought for more than ten years and the people of North China who had supported the war for the complete liberation of North China. Vice-Chairman Lan Gongwu then proposed that in order to complete the arduous construction tasks, we must study with humility and boldness. Finally, the First Art Troupe of North China University performed victory songs, supporting true peace and opposing false peace, among other programs.

    华北级干部盛大集会
    庆祝华北全境解放
    薄一波同志指示建设任务号召照顾四面八方关系
    【本报讯】为了庆祝华北全境解放、迎接全国胜利，在平的华北级干部四千余人昨（十四）日在中山公园音乐堂举行庆祝晚会。中国共产党华北局书记薄一波、华北人民政府正副主席董必武、蓝公武、华北军区司令员聂荣臻亲临讲话，对于新形势下的华北提出了新的任务与指示。
    薄一波同志首先说明华北已完全从战争环境转入了和平建设环境，今后华北压倒一切的中心任务就是恢复和发展生产。我们已赢得或将要赢得战争的完全胜利，如同毛主席指示我们的一样，这胜利是伟大的，但与今后的长期的建设任务比较起来，这只是万里长征的第一步。希望大家时刻记起毛主席给我们的指示。接着他又简明地阐述了毛主席关于建设路线的指示，他说一切工作都要照顾到劳资、公私、城乡、内外等四面八方的关系，如果有一面解决不好就会犯严重的错误。其次他说到要分清敌我的界限，要坚决团结工人、农民、革命知识分子、自由资产阶级来反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。
    华北人民政府董必武主席说，华北能取得彻底胜利是因为有人民解放军英勇奋战和广大的人民生产支前的结果，胜利以后我们要很快地进行全面建设工作，现在我们要先行建设新华北，建设的前途虽然困难还很多，但中国人民是勤劳、勇敢、耐劳的，我们不向困难低头，我们就会胜利。
    华北军区司令员聂荣臻同志在热烈的掌声中讲话，他说由于东北华北人民解放军的配合，很顺利的把华北全部解放了。华中、华南、连帝国主义在中国最后的最大一个堡垒——上海也快解放了。他又说解放了要进一步巩固华北的胜利和治安，使人民安心进行生产，必须彻底把反革命残余势力肃清。建设工作还在开始，我们不应自满，要好好学习建设工作。他又为华北的全部解放向转战十多年的华北战士和支援战争的华北人民致敬。蓝公武副主席则提出要完成艰巨的建设任务，必须要虚心、大胆的学习。最后由华北大学第一文工团演出胜利歌舞、拥护真和平、反对假和平等节目。
