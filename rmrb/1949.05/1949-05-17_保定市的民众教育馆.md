　　The Baoding Municipal People's Education Center

　　The Baoding Municipal People's Education Center is located in the ancient "Lianchi Academy," featuring pavilions, towers, groves, and artificial hills, making it the only tranquil spot in Baoding city. Legend has it that Lianchi Academy was built in the Yuan Dynasty as the villa of a certain "General" Zhang Rou. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was converted into an academy, with the feudal anecdote "Idlers Keep Out, Sages Welcome; Thieves Rest, Followers Come" circulating, marking it as a very old feudal cultural fortress. During the successive rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders, the academy was turned into a library, housing a collection of 100,000 books. The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to rule and oppress the people, had no need for culture. They set up their henchmen's police station inside, with strict gate controls. Apart from a few students, only those bureaucratic politicians and their concubines could swagger in and out for leisure. The vast majority of citizens regarded it as a forbidden place,不敢lightly entering. Before Baoding's liberation, when the Kuomintang fled, they wantonly destroyed the books in the courtyard, attempting to ruin it.

　　Since Baoding's liberation last November, over the past six months, under the leadership of the Communist Party, this feudal cultural fortress has been transformed into the Baoding People's Cultural Paradise—the People's Education Center beloved by the masses. The sign "Idlers Keep Out" has been removed, replaced by many slogans serving workers, students, and citizens.

　　The original library contained mostly feudal and backward moral books, now used only as historical references. Many Marxist-Leninist books and Chairman Mao's works have been replenished, along with numerous social science and natural science books, publications, newspapers, and magazines. As the book content suits the readers' needs, the number of readers is increasing. In January, a total of 1,112 people read, which increased to 3,921 in April. The number of workers and citizens reading newspapers and books is increasing daily. Zhang Ziying, a postal worker at the Liu Sheng Temple Post Office, and Zhang Guoliang, a Rong vendor in Xiguan, prepare to borrow books once a week, saying, "Since the establishment of the People's Education Center, we have increased a lot of knowledge." The old so-called literati's "Algae Chant Pavilion" has now been transformed into a people's recreation room. Whenever a new work or situation has a new change, this recreation room is used to hold forums for workers and citizens. When discussing Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order for the People's Liberation Army to cross the Yangtze River and advance south, the workers excitedly said, "That's what should be done. There will be no peace until the Kuomintang reactionaries are completely eliminated." This is a clear contrast to the Kuomintang's rule, where "Don't talk about state affairs" was written everywhere. In addition, literary and art groups are organized according to the workers' time (such as Sundays) to perform new Cizidagu [a form of storytelling], which is also well-received. The People's Education Center has truly become a paradise for the entire city. Many workers, students, and the vast majority of citizens are playing basketball, reading books and newspapers, and freely browsing ancient cultural relics that many working people have never seen or even heard of, filled with joyful hearts. Villagers from far away who come to Baoding for business also come here to visit.

　　Every corner of the People's Education Center is plastered with cartoons that clearly contrast the enemy and ourselves. Even illiterate people can understand the general situation by looking at them.

　　The blackboard newspaper is the most closely connected with the masses. It promptly writes out the current news and local news received every day, and produces briefs of these news to supply the city's one hundred blackboard newspapers. The directly managed blackboard newspaper also has a policy Q&A column. Citizens often ask the People's Education Center about some difficult questions. For urgent matters, the People's Education Center promptly refers them to the government or relevant departments for resolution. For policy-related questions, the People's Education Center provides public answers. An old lady who runs a small stall on the street, selling things for others on commission, stated that it was Ji banknotes [currency used in the Ji region], but she mistakenly sold them as Bian banknotes [currency used in the border region]. The original owner did not agree, and the old lady was very anxious. Later, the People's Education Center, through publicity and deliberation, found the buyer and paid the amount in Ji banknotes, resolving the matter satisfactorily. Therefore, citizens reflected, "This is much better than going to court in the past." "They tell you what to do in any situation, which is truly serving the masses!" Because the materials on the blackboard newspaper are constantly changing and related to the actual problems of the citizens, some citizens often take small notebooks to copy them.

　　Recently, the People's Education Center and the First District Workers' Union jointly established a workers' night school, which has absorbed forty-two scattered workers such as masons, blacksmiths, shoemakers, weavers, and paperhangers to participate in learning. A workers' reading room has also been prepared, with books and newspapers that are relatively simple, as well as many cartoons. The social service department of the People's Education Center often sends people to deliver books to the two workers' amateur schools affiliated with Baoding Normal School Elementary School and Women's Normal School Elementary School. Before the workers arrive for class, cadres from the People's Education Center take out books and cartoons to explain to the workers. The workers love to hear stories of the Liberation War and labor heroes the most, which also gives them the greatest inspiration. In the future, the People's Education Center is planning to send books suitable for workers' learning to larger factories for regular exchange reading, saving workers' time.

　　The Baoding Municipal People's Education Center has become a cultural paradise for the entire people. It is further developing based on the opinions and demands of workers, students, and citizens. In Xiguan and Nanguan, it is planned to set up separate workers' clubs. At the same time, it will use all means to tell every citizen of Baoding the Communist Party's propositions, policies, scientific knowledge, and revolutionary theories.

　　保定市的民众教育馆
    保定市的民众教育馆，设在古“莲池书院”，内有楼台、亭阁、林木、假山，是保定城内唯一清幽所在。但相传莲池书院建于元代，是一个所谓张柔“将军”的别墅。到明、清两代改为讲书院，曾流传着“闲人免进贤人进，盗者休来道者来”的封建逸话，是一个很古老的封建文化堡垒。国民党、日寇前后统治期间书院改为图书馆，集藏图书十万册。国民党反动派为了统治和迫害人民，他们并不要什么文化，把他们的爪牙警察处设在里边，门禁森严，除了少数学生外，只有那些官僚政客和他们的姨太太们可以大摇大摆的出入游逛，广大市民都视为禁地，不敢轻入。保定市解放前国民党逃跑时，曾把院内图书捣毁的乱成一片。企图把它破坏。
    自去年十一月保定解放后，半年的过程中，在共产党的领导下，这个封建的文化堡垒，已改造为保定市人民文化乐园——为大众所喜爱的民众教育馆。“闲人免进”的牌子摘掉了，换上许多为工人、学生、市民服务的标语。
    原来图书馆内多是封建落后道德的书籍，只是作为今后研究历史的参考了。现在又重新充实了许多马列主义书籍和毛主席著作，还有许多社会科学与自然科学及各种政策的书籍、刊物、报张和杂志。由于书籍内容适合于读者的要求，阅读者越来越多了，一月份共计阅读者一千一百十二人，四月份已增到三千九百二十一人了。工人和市民阅读书报的逐日增加。刘圣庙邮寄代办所邮工张子英，西关摆荣摊张国良，每星期准备借书一次，他们说：“自从成立了民教馆，我们增加了好多知识。”旧有的所谓文人骚士的“藻咏亭”，现在改成了人民的游艺室，每当一件新的工作或形势有新变化时，即利用这个游艺室召开工人、市民座谈会。当座谈毛主席、朱总司令命令解放军渡江南进时，工人们兴奋的说：“就是该这么办，不消灭完了国民党反动派没有和平。”这与国民党统治时代到处写着“莫谈国事”是个显明的对照。此外，还根据着工人的时间，（如星期日）组织文艺团体说新词大鼓书，反映也很好。民教馆真正成了整个市民的乐园。许多的工人、学生、和广大的市民，有的在打篮球，有的在阅览书报，许多劳动人民平生未见过的甚至也未听到说过的古老文物，现在都在自由的浏览着，到处充满着愉快的心情。离城很远来保市办事的老乡们，都到这里来参观。
    民教馆的每一个角落里，都张贴着敌我显明对照的漫画，不识字的文盲看了它，也可了解目前形势的大概。
    与群众联系最密切的是黑板报，它把每天收到的时事消息和本市消息都及时的写出来，并且把这些消息制出简报，供给全市一百块黑板报使用。直接掌握的黑板报，并设有政策问答栏，市民常把一些疑难问题去问民教馆，凡属于急待解决的，民教馆就及时的介绍到政府或有关部门去解决，属于政策性的，民教馆则公开给予解答。一个老太太在街上摆小摊，给人家代卖东西，当时说明是冀钞，而她误认为按边钞就卖了，原主不依，老太太很着急，后来民教馆通过宣传酝酿，找到了买主，又按冀钞付了款，圆满解决了。因此市民反映“这比过去打官司可强了。”“什么事应当怎么办，人家就说给，这才是为群众服务呢！”因为黑板报上的材料经常改换与联系市民的实际问题，常有些市民拿着小本子抄录。
    近来民教馆与一区职工会又联合成立了工人夜校，已吸收了零散的瓦工、铁工、鞋工、织布、裱糊等四十二个工人参加了学习。并已筹备好工人阅览室，书籍和报张，都是比较浅的，还备有好多漫画。民教馆的社会服务部，经常派人给保师附小和女师附小附设的两个工人业余学校送书籍，在上课前，工人还未来齐时，民教馆干部就拿出书籍和漫画给工人讲解，工人最爱听的是解放战争和劳动英模的故事，也给他们启示最大。今后民教馆正计划着对较大的工厂，把适合于工人学习的书籍送去，定期的换阅，免去工人耽误时间。
    保定市的民众教育馆，已成为全人民的文化乐园。它正在根据着工人、学生、市民的意见和要求，更进一步的建设着。在西关和南关，已计划另设工人俱乐部，同时，还通过一切方式把共产党的主张、政策和科学知识、革命理论等，告诉给保定市的每个市民。
