Three or Two Words

    Thrift and frugality were once one of the finest styles of the liberated areas’ military and civilians, and they have now made a very deep impression on the people of the big cities. However, in order to meet the needs of the large-scale liberation war, we still need to be more frugal. For example, why can't many agencies switch from one lamp per person, with 50 or 60 candlepower, to one lamp for two people, with 15 to 20 candlepower? Isn't that still better than using oil lamps in the countryside? However, this requires a spirit of "starting with oneself" and "walking the talk." If everyone thinks, "How much can I save or spend alone?" and wants to stay out of the movement, then there will never be a real savings movement. For the sake of developing production and for the future, everyone should grit their teeth.

    节约要说到做到
    俭朴，曾经是解放区军民最优良的作风之一，现在且已给与大城市人民极深刻的印象。但是，为适应大规模解放战争的需要，我们还需要俭朴些。比方说，不少机关里一人一灯，且都是五、六十支光的，为什么不可以换成二人一灯，十五至二十支光的呢？这还不比我们在乡下用油灯强吗？可是，这就需要有“从自己做起”，“说到做到”的精神，如果每个人都想着“我一个人省几何，费几何，”都想把自己置身运动之外，那就永不会有真正的节约运动。为了发展生产，为了将来，大家还是咬咬牙好。
