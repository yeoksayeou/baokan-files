Mortar Group

In the Taiyuan liberation campaign, our mortar group played a significant role. On April 20th, when our army was sweeping the periphery of Taiyuan, the mortar's mission was mainly to suppress the enemy's artillery fire and, secondly, to open up assault routes for the infantry. When our mortar groups began firing at the enemy's artillery positions at Twin Pagoda Temple, Huangjiafen, Dadongmen..., the mountains and the earth shook. On the battlefield, no other weapons could be heard, only the thunderous roar of the mortars; nothing else could be seen, only the dust and smoke stirred up by the mortar shells, the birds in the sky were startled and flew around, and the enemy's artillery and infantry burrowed into the bunkers, afraid to raise their heads. The enemy's artillery in the northeast corner of the city once attempted to fire at our advancing infantry, but after they fired only three shells, one of our large mortar shells hit the enemy's strong bunker, killing two and wounding three of the enemy; the enemy's artillery fell silent. The enemy's artillery at the Twin Pagoda Temple once attempted to prevent our infantry from attacking by firing sneak shots. To support the infantry's assault, the artilleryman of the 5th company fired fifty shells in a row, forty-six of which hit the target, winning applause and cheers from the infantry and laborers on the battlefield, who shouted, "Well done!" The artillery's battle cry was "Thoroughly defeat the enemy's artillery, knock them upside down, make their fortifications blossom, and make the obstacles fly into the sky. Vigorously support the infantry in combat and give full play to the power of the people's artillery!" They all achieved this slogan. On the afternoon of the 21st, the infantry attacked the Beiguan Power Plant. As the battle was raging, the enemy suddenly drove two armored trains along the railway on the city wall from the west, firing at our infantry. At this time, Zhang, the deputy regiment commander of an artillery command post, immediately ordered the 8th company by telephone: "Use fifteen shells to destroy the first armored vehicle!" Jin Daojun, the first platoon leader, immediately ordered the first gunner to fire at the armored vehicle. The first shell flew out of the barrel and exploded in front of the armored vehicle. Then another shell landed behind the vehicle, forcing the armored vehicle to stop on the tracks, making them scream in anger. The third shell landed on the carriage, and the twelfth shell hit the front of the vehicle, and immediately smoke and fire rose. But the second armored vehicle was still firing at our infantry. The first gunners fired several more rounds in succession, destroying the second armored vehicle, so the menacing armored vehicles were immediately burned and lay on the tracks, and the enemies on the vehicles fled in panic. The regimental headquarters immediately informed all the artillery and ordered the first gun of the 8th company to be credited with meritorious service. The first gunners danced with joy and sang the newly composed artillery song. On the 24th, our army launched a general attack on Taiyuan City, and the mortar group bombarded the city walls according to the firing plan, opening up a route for the infantry to climb the city. When the mortar group was concentrating its strength to bombard the breach with a storm of steel, the soldiers launched a signal to climb the city and called for the mortar to stop firing. They poured into the city from the not-completely-opened breach or from the blown-up city gates on all sides, resolving the battle in four hours. The artillery praised, "The infantry comrades are really brave!" And the infantry pioneers who climbed the city humbly said, "We didn't do anything, it was the artillery that fired well!" After the battle, I asked a few prisoners, and they spoke of our mortars with great fear. They all said, "Your mortars are powerful, powerful!" (This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch)

    榴弹炮群
    在解放太原战役中，我们的榴弹炮群起了极大的作用。四月二十日，我军扫荡太原外围，榴弹炮的任务主要是压制敌人的炮火，其次是为步兵开辟冲锋道路。当我各榴弹炮群开始向敌人炮兵阵地双塔寺、黄家坟、大东门………发射的时候，山和大地都震动了。战场上听不到其他武器的声音，只有榴弹炮如雷一样的隆隆轰鸣；看不见别的，只见到榴弹炮弹所掀起的尘土和烟雾，天空鸟儿被震得乱飞，敌人的炮兵和步兵都钻到地洞中不敢抬头，东北城角的敌炮曾企图开炮打我前进中的步兵，但他们只打了三发炮弹，我们一颗大榴弹炮弹便打进敌人坚固的炮碉里，打死敌人两个，伤了三个，敌人的炮再也不响了。双塔寺的敌炮曾企图阻止我步兵攻击，偷打冷炮，炮手为支援步兵冲锋，五连炮手连打五十发炮弹，四十六发命中，博得战场上的步兵和民工鼓掌喝采，高叫：“打得好！”炮兵作战的口号是“将敌人的炮兵彻底打垮，打得他人仰马翻，工事开花，鹿砦飞天，有力的支援步兵作战，高度发挥人民炮兵的威力。”这一口号他们都做到了。二十一日下午步兵攻北关发电厂，战斗正激烈时，敌人突然从西面沿城墙铁路开来两列铁甲车，向我步兵射击，此时某炮兵指挥所张副团长立刻用电话命令八连：“以十五发炮弹把第一列装甲车击毁！”一排长金道俊立刻命令一炮炮手向那装甲车射击。第一发炮弹飞出膛后，落在装甲车前爆炸了。接着又一发落在车后，装甲车被迫停在铁轨上，气的直叫。第三发落在车箱上，第十二发击中车头，顿时烟火四起。但第二列装甲车仍向我步兵射击，一炮炮手们又连续打了几发，便将第二列装甲车击毁，于是来势汹汹的装甲车，立即被烧毁了，躺在轨道上，车上的敌人慌忙的逃窜了。团指挥所立刻通报各炮，并通令给八连一炮记功，一炮炮手们手足舞蹈，高兴的唱起新编的炮兵歌。二十四日，我军总攻太原城、榴弹炮群按照射击计划轰击城墙，为步兵开辟登城道路。当榴弹炮群正集中力量以钢铁的暴风雨轰击突破口，战士们便发起登城的信号叫榴弹炮停射，他们从未完全开好的突破口上，或从爆破了的城门中四面涌入城内，四小时解决了战斗。炮兵称赞说：“步兵同志真勇猛啊！”而步兵登城先锋却谦虚的说：“我们没有什么，是炮打的好啊！”战后我问了几个俘虏，他们谈起我们的榴弹炮来，大有谈虎色变之势。他们一个个都说：“你们的榴弹炮厉害，厉害！”（本报太原电）
