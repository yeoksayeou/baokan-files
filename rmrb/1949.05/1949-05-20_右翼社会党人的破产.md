　　The Bankruptcy of Right-Wing Social Democrats

    The Italian Socialist Party Congress passed a resolution led by Nenni, reaffirming close cooperation with the Communist Party. From within the Socialist Party, due to the close cooperation between the two parties, the forces of democratic progress have become stronger, and the split conspiracy carried out by the far-right Romita group has been miserably defeated and increasingly isolated. Comrade Togliatti has emphasized that the fulfillment of the unity of the two parties has its great political significance. Progressive Social Democrats understand this, and therefore the left wing has won, further exposing the ugliness of the right-wing Social Democrats, ultimately leading to bankruptcy. This is an excellent lesson for Western European Social Democrats.

　　右翼社会党人的破产
    意大利社会党代表大会通过南尼所领导的左派重申与共产党紧密合作的议案。从社会党党内来说，由于共社两党的紧密合作，民主进步的力量益趋强大，极右派罗米塔集团所进行的分裂阴谋因之惨遭失败，日益孤立。托格里亚蒂同志曾着重指出：履行两党联合具有它重大的政治意义，进步的社会党员是明白这个道理的，因之左派获得了胜利，而更加暴露了右翼社会党人的丑恶终至于破产，这对西欧社会党人来说，是极好的教训。
