    Taiyuan War Criminals' Ironclad Evidence of Murder!
    53 Bodies Unearthed from Yan's Bandit Secret Killing Den
    [Taiyuan Electric] The ironclad evidence of the "Special Police and Gendarmerie Command," organized by Yan Xishan and directed by bandits Liang Huazhi, Xu Duan, and others, to brutally harm the people has been discovered in the No. 18 courtyard of Houbaling Bridge on the 4th and 5th. In this one secret killing den alone, 53 bodies were unearthed. The captured culprit, Yang Tao, the former deputy captain of the special agent team, initially confessed that there were 40 bodies in the courtyard, all secretly murdered between April 20th and 23rd, but the excavation revealed more than that number. On the first day, 33 bodies were unearthed in the first pit, and on the second day, another 20 bodies were unearthed in the second pit. The deceased all had their arms tied tightly behind their backs, bound tightly to their heads and necks. Each face was swollen, tongues were extended, eyes bulged, and blood flowed from their noses and mouths. Seeing this, one could not help but imagine how tragic the deceased were in their final moments, and how cruel the murderers were! It is said that this is a new killing method "invented" by the secret agents, which can "be bloodless, silent, and leave no traces." They strangled people alive in this way, and then burned the archives and confessions, vainly attempting to eliminate the evidence and escape their guilt. Our Northeast Film Team has captured this batch of bloody corpses on film, so as to present ironclad evidence during the trial of war criminals. According to preliminary investigation, the victims included underground members of the Chinese Communist Party, workers, students, public school teachers and staff. Some people were arrested and secretly executed simply because their families were in the liberated areas, or because they corresponded with relatives and friends in the liberated areas. Even personnel from the secret service who were unwilling to continue committing evil and murder were also killed. Currently, the families have identified five people: Zhao Shoufeng, a former teacher at the Girls' Normal School; Zhu Hengshan, an employee of Jinxing Mechanical and Electrical Plant; and Yang Tusheng, an employee of Jinxing No. 3 Plant. The murderers continued to confess that 13 people were buried in the No. 1 courtyard of Donghua Gate. According to investigation, it is confirmed that in the days before the liberation of Taiyuan, war criminals Liang Huazhi and others conducted a "emergency disposal" massacre, in which more than 2,000 underground members of the Chinese Communist Party, workers, students, public school teachers and staff were killed.

    太原战犯杀人铁证！
    由阎匪秘密杀人窟中  已挖出五十三具尸体
    【太原电】以阎匪锡山为首指挥梁化之、徐端等匪所组织的“特种警宪指挥处”，残害人民铁证，已于四、五两日在后霸陵桥十八号院内查获。仅在此一秘密杀人窟中，即挖出五十三具尸体。落网凶手原特务队副队长杨涛初供该院内有四十具尸体，都是四月二十日至二十三日暗害的，但挖掘结果却不止此数，第一天在第一个坑内挖出三十三具，第二天又在第二个坑内挖出二十具，死者都是臂被反缚，和头颈紧紧捆在一起，一个个脸面浮肿舌头伸长，眼睛突出，鼻嘴流血，使人一见就不禁想到死者临难时多么的惨痛，凶手们是多么的残忍！据说这就是特务们“发明”的新的杀人法，可以“不出血，不叫喊，无痕迹”。他们这种活活地把人勒死，又将档案口供烧毁，妄想消灭痕迹，逃避罪责，我东北电影队已将这批血尸摄入镜头，以便在审判战犯时提出铁证。据初步调查，被害者有中共地下党员，有工人、学生与公教人员，有的人仅因家在解放区，或和解放区的亲友通信，即被逮捕，秘密处死。甚至特务机关的人员，有不愿继续作恶杀人的，亦被害死。现在经家属辨认出来的，已有原女师教员赵守封，晋兴机电化厂职员朱衡山，晋兴三厂职员杨秃生等五人。凶手们继续供认：东华门一号院内埋着十三个人。据调查证实：在我解放太原前数日内战犯梁化之等，曾进行一次“紧急处理”的大暗杀，被杀害之中共地下党员、工人、学生、公教人员在两千人以上。
