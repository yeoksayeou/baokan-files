From the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference
    *Pravda* Diplomatic Commentator, Malinin

    A year and a half has passed since the last London Foreign Ministers' Conference. No one can deny that, due to the policies pursued by the ruling groups of the US, Britain, and France during this period, the German question has not only not been resolved, but has even reached a dead end. Consequently, such an important institution as the Allied Control Council, in which representatives of all Allied countries occupying Germany participated, was destined to be inactive precisely when its activities were particularly necessary.

    From the first day of the so-called Berlin crisis, the Soviet government has consistently insisted that the Foreign Ministers' Conference should discuss major issues of a pan-German nature together with the direct resolution of the Berlin dispute. However, convening a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss and resolve the entire German question was clearly contrary to the intentions of the Western countries. They cancelled the agreement reached in Moscow in August 1948 and handed the discussion of the "Berlin crisis" over to the Security Council in Paris. Although there was absolutely no basis for including the resolution of this issue on the Security Council's agenda, an agreement was still reached during informal negotiations in Paris. However, this agreement suffered the same fate as the 1948 Moscow agreement. The draft resolution of the Security Council, which the representatives of the Soviet Union and other relevant countries strived for on October 24, 1948, was rejected by the representatives of the US, Britain, and France on October 25.

    In late January of this year, Comrade Stalin, in his reply to Mr. Smith, once again suggested resolving the "Berlin crisis," but subject to convening a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the entire German question. Since then, three months have passed. Now, the governments of the US, Britain, and France consider it possible to accept this basis for resolving the "Berlin crisis" and agree to convene a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss not only the Berlin issue, but also the entire German question.

    It took the governments of the US, Britain, and France more than a year to abandon their resistance to the Foreign Ministers' Conference and restore the activities of this body, which is the only one authorized to decide the status of all of Germany or any part of Germany. There is no doubt that if the US, Britain, and France had not adopted a path that disregarded the Foreign Ministers' Conference from the beginning, there would have been no "Berlin crisis" at all. Indeed, it was not the "Berlin crisis" that caused the crisis in the Foreign Ministers' Conference. On the contrary, the tendency to abolish the activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was one of the causes of the "Berlin crisis." But what is the reason for this persistent desire to terminate the activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference? The reason lies in the general line of the ruling groups of the US, Britain, and France on the German question. Everyone knows the main features of this line.

    Its first feature is the abandonment of the political, economic, and organizational program adopted by the Allied Potsdam Conference on the German question. The correctness of the above program has been proven not only by historical experience, but also by all post-war international developments. There can be no lasting international peace without lasting peace in Europe, and there can be no lasting peace in Europe unless the question of turning Germany into a peaceful and democratic country is resolved. Precisely for this reason, the basic principles and foundations of the Potsdam program are cooperation among the occupying countries on the German question. The policies of the US and Britain on the German question are diametrically opposed to the Potsdam program. Their agenda is not to turn Germany into a unified, demilitarized, and democratic country, but to dismember Germany and bring the Ruhr magnates into the system of the aggressive US-British bloc. The divisive activities of the US, British, and French occupation authorities and the refusal to implement the four-power decisions on the joint administration of Germany are a natural consequence of this policy. Dividing Germany has become a way to divide Europe. A straight road leads from the joint occupation zone to the aggressive Western European alliance and then to the North Atlantic Group. From February 23 to June 1948, the US, Britain, and France met continuously in London to discuss the German question; this meeting was a milestone on the road to completing the division and dismemberment of Germany. This meeting provided the practical basis for establishing a government in the western occupation zones of Germany and at the same time made some decisions to ensure the dominant position of US-British monopoly capital in the Ruhr area. The London Conference also predetermined and planned the divisive currency reform, which economically erected a wall between eastern and western Germany. This divisive currency reform naturally created a specific threat to the interests of Berlin itself and the economic life of the entire eastern occupation zone. Could the Soviet occupation authorities, who were responsible for the economic situation in the area under their control, not take the necessary protective measures to stop this threat? The "Berlin crisis" was needed by the Western countries as a smokescreen to cover up their frenzied divisive activities to complete the division and dismemberment of Germany.

    What are the consequences of the divisive policies of the US and British ruling groups? The first consequence of the policy of dividing Germany is that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is even more distant. The temporarily necessary occupation system has become a permanent "attribute." Some people want to perpetuate it with the so-called "occupation statute." Some Western politicians bluntly link the idea of giving the "occupation statute" legal status in West Germany with the idea of establishing an occupation system for the whole of Western Europe.

    The second consequence of the divisive policies pursued by the US and Britain is that Germany has been dismembered in violation of the solemn agreement made by the great powers. Experience has shown that the division of Germany is not only extremely harmful to the fundamental interests of the German people, but also fraught with great dangers to international cooperation.

    The third consequence of the Western countries' divisive policies on the German question is the extremely difficult economic situation in West Germany. More than 10 percent of all employees in West Germany are completely unemployed. The purchasing power of the people is constantly declining. More than 40 percent of the people in the joint occupation zone cannot afford the already small food rations. At the same time, 30 percent of the budget of the joint occupation zone is spent on occupation fees. This is the price the German people pay for the US-British policy of dismembering Germany. This policy has brought the economy of West Germany to the brink of collapse.

    The fourth consequence of the US-British divisive policy in West Germany is: first, the great restoration of reactionary groups; second, the fierce opposition of the progressive German public to the US-British line. The Ruhr magnates are the main pillar of the occupation system in West Germany. At the same time, many administrative and economic organs in the joint occupation zone are in the hands of Hitlerites, who have not even intended to change their flags. The broad public believes that this policy is a plot to murder the country's national independence, unity, and future.

    Needless to say, the Western countries' divisive policies in Germany, their non-cooperative attitude towards the Soviet Union, their violation of the Potsdam program, the establishment of aggressive military blocs, and their efforts to make the international situation increasingly serious, all of this combined has aroused an unprecedentedly powerful and unprecedentedly large-scale movement throughout the world to defend peace, oppose the threat of a new war, and oppose new international adventures. This is a settlement of accounts for the US, Britain, and France in implementing a divisive policy on the German question.

    The Soviet Union has always advocated and still advocates a complete resolution of the German question in the spirit of the obligations undertaken by the occupying countries at the Potsdam Conference. The agreement between the Soviet Union, the US, Britain, and France on resuming the activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has opened up prospects for negotiations, first and foremost on the major German issues. Whether this negotiation will succeed depends on the attitude of the Western countries. (Note: This article is based on a TASS dispatch on the 20th.

### 从伦敦外长会议到巴黎外长会议

　　从伦敦外长会议到巴黎外长会议
    真理报外交评论员马里宁
    自上次伦敦外长会议以来，一年半已经过去了。没有人能够否认：由于美英法统治集团在这一段时间内奉行的政策，德国问题不但没有解决，甚至还走到了绝路。由此，象一切占领德国的盟国都有代表参加的盟国管制委员会这样的重要机构，就注定了其活动特别必要的时候陷于不活动状态。
    从所谓柏林危机存在的第一天起，苏联政府就一直坚持由外长会议与柏林之争议问题的直接解决一起，讨论全德性质的重大问题。但是，召开外长会议以讨论并解决整个德国问题，恰恰是与西方国家的打算显然违背的。他们取消了一九四八年八月在莫斯科达到的协议，而把关于“柏林危机”的讨论交给在巴黎举行的安全理事会。虽然把这个问题的解决列入安理会的议程是绝对没有任何根据的，但在巴黎的非正式谈判中，仍然达到了协议。可是，这个协议也遭到了一九四八年莫斯科协议的同样命运。苏联及其他有关国家代表一九四八年十月二十四日所争取到的安理会决议草案，在十月二十五日被美英法代表否决了。
    本年一月下旬，斯大林同志在回答史密斯的问题时，再度建议解决“柏林危机”，但须召开外长会议讨论全部德国问题。从那个时候起，三个月又过去了。现在，美英法政府认为有可能接受这个解决“柏林危机”的基础，并同意召开外长会议，不仅讨论柏林问题，还讨论整个德国问题。
    美英法政府要一年多的时间，才放弃其对外长会议的抵制，恢复这个唯一有权决定全德的或德国任何地区的地位之机构的活动。不可怀疑，如果不是美英法从一开始起就采取了置外长会议于不顾的道路，那么，根本就不会有什么“柏林危机”。的确，并不是“柏林危机”引起了外长会议中的危机。而是相反，取消外长会议的倾向是“柏林危机”的原因之一。但是，这种固执的终止外长会议活动的愿望，其原因是什么呢？这个原因就在于美英法统治集团在德国问题上的总路线。这个路线的主要特点是大家都知道的。
    它的第一个特点就是背弃盟国波茨坦会议关于德国问题所采取的政治、经济与组织机构的纲领。而上述纲领的正确性，不只为历史的经验所证实，同时也为一切战后的国际发展所证实。如果没有欧洲的持久和平，就不可能有国际的持久和平，如果将德国变成和平民主国家的问题没有解决，就不可能有欧洲的持久和平。正因为这样，波茨坦纲领的基本原则和其基础，乃是占领国家在德国问题上的合作。美英在德国问题上的政策，是与波茨坦纲领澈头澈尾地背道而驰的。他们的日程，不是把德国变成统一的、肃清了军国主义的、民主的国家，而是肢解德国，使鲁尔大王们进入侵略性的美英集团的体系。美英法占领机构的分裂活动和拒绝实行联合管理德国的四国决定，是这个政策的自然结果。分裂德国，变成了分裂欧洲的一种办法。笔直的大路从联合占领区通到侵略性的西欧联盟，又通到北大西洋集团。自一九四八年二月二十三日以至六月，美英法曾在伦敦不断开会，讨论德国问题；这个会议是走向德国的分裂和肢解的完成的道路上的路标。这个会议提供了建立德国西部占领区政府的实际基础，并同时作了一些决定，来保证美英独占资本在鲁尔区的统治地位。伦敦会议也预先决定了并计划了分裂的货币改革，从经济上说，这个改革在德国的东部与西部之间竖起了一道墙壁。这一分裂的货币改革，自然而然地产生了对柏林自身以及对整个东部占领区经济生活的利益的具体威胁。对于其所管制地区的经济情况职责所在的苏联占领当局，难道能够不采取必要的保护措施来制止这一威胁吗？“柏林危机”是西方国家所需要的，用来作为掩盖他们完成德国分裂和肢解的狂烈分裂活动的烟幕。
    美英统治集团的分裂政策产生一些什么后果呢？分裂德国政策的第一个后果，是缔结对德和约更加遥遥无期了。暂时必要的占领制度，变成一种永恒的“属性”了。有些人想用所谓“占领法规”来把它永久化。某些西方政客率直地把给西德“占领法规”以合法招牌的想法，和建立一种整个西欧的占领制度的想法连在一起。
    美英所奉行的分裂政策的第二个后果是违背大国所作的庄严约定，德国遭到肢解。经验证明，德国的分裂，不仅极有害于德国人民的根本利益，而且同时对国际合作充满了重大危险。
    西方国家在德国问题上的分裂政策的第三个后果，就是西德经济情况的极度困难。西德全部职工有百分之十以上完全失业。人民购买力不断下降。联合占领区百分之四十以上的人民买不起本来已经够少了的食物配给。同时，联占区预算的百分之三十花在占领费上。这就是德国人民为美英肢解德国政策付出的代价。这个政策使西德的经济陷于崩裂。
    美英在西德的分裂政策的第四个后果，是：第一，大大恢复了反动集团；第二，引起了德国进步公众激烈反对美英的路线。鲁尔大王们是西德占领制度的主要支柱。同时，联占区许多行政和经济机关，都掌握在希特勒分子手里，这些人甚至没有打算改换旗帜。广大公众认为这个政策是谋害该国的国家独立、统一与前途的。
    不用说，西方国家在德国的分裂政策，他们的对苏不合作态度，背充波茨坦纲领，建立侵略性军事集团和力图使国际形势益趋严重，所有这一切加在一起，就引起了全世界保卫和平、反对新战争威胁和反对新国际冒险的空前强大、空前宏大规模的运动。这就是美英法在德国问题上执行分裂政策的一笔清帐。
    苏联一向主张，现在仍然主张按照占领国在波茨坦会议上所承担的义务的精神，完全解决德国问题。苏、美、英、法关于恢复外长会议活动的协议，打开了进行谈判、首先是关于重大的德国问题谈判的前途。这次谈判之能否成功，决定于西方国家的态度。（按：本文根据塔斯社二十日电讯。愿为新华社编者所加。）
