    The People's Government Provides Large Loans to Help
    Kailuan Clean Coal Mine Pay Back Wages
    (Tangshan Electric) With the help of loans from the North China People's Government, the Tangshan Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine began on the 4th to pay out a large portion of the workers' owed wages. Since October of last year, Kailuan Coal Mine has been unable to transport its million tons of coal due to traffic disruptions, and funds have been unable to circulate. The wage arrears from December of last year to the present are now being re-issued. During this period, in addition to sporadic advances to workers, workers did not receive wages for several months, and their lives became increasingly difficult. Since May, the trade union has put forward demands to the mine for guaranteeing workers' livelihoods. All workers have continued production. The production efficiency of each coal miner has gradually increased from nearly 400 kilograms per day in the early days of liberation to over 600 kilograms recently, with the highest reaching 670 kilograms. On the 18th of last month, labor and management went to the North China People's Government for a meeting and reached an agreement on the issue of clearing arrears. Under the principle of benefiting both labor and management and taking into account both public and private interests, the People's Government, on April 28, loaned the mine 300 million yuan in Renminbi in real terms through the Tianjin People's Bank to solve the mine's difficulties in clearing wage arrears. The Tangshan Mine began on May 4 to issue the outstanding wages for the first three months of this year and the remaining one-fifth of December last year. However, due to recent price increases, the mine's available cash could only cover 70% of the aforementioned arrears. At the workers' request, the mine agreed to pay the remaining 30% by May 8, but still felt unable to fulfill this commitment. To this end, the Tianjin People's Bank once again loaned 300 million yuan, so that the remaining 30% could be paid on schedule on the 8th, and the remaining part of the year-end bonus last year was also paid off. In total, this expenditure has given the Kailuan workers, who are living in difficult circumstances, a breather. The North China People's Government has loaned a total of 600 million yuan in Renminbi in two installments, accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount issued by both parties (including a portion for staff). After this expenditure, the mine has cleared its wage arrears to the workers. As for the flour component of the wages, due to the Chiang Kai-shek clique's blockade of ships and ports and the disruption of shipping, the source of flour has been temporarily cut off, making it impossible to redeem the flour coupons issued for four or five months. It is reported that the North China People's Government will also lend Kailuan Coal Mine 12 million catties of coarse grains to temporarily solve this problem.

    人民政府大量贷款帮助
    开滦洁煤矿发清欠资
    【唐山电】开滦煤矿在华北人民政府贷款帮助下，唐山矿已于四日开始发放了工人工资亏欠的大部分。自去年十月以来，开滦煤矿由于交通断绝，存煤百万吨无法运出，资金无法周转。自去年十二月份至现在的工资债欠补发。其间除零星给工人借支外，几个月工人未领工资，生活日益困窘。五月以来，职工会一方面向矿方提出了保障工人生活的要求，全体工人则仍坚持了生产。每个煤工的生产效率，也从解放初期近四百公斤的日产量，逐步提高至最近的六百多公斤，最高者达到六百七十公斤。上月十八日劳资双方去华北人民政府开会，对还清亏欠问题，劳资双方商致协议。人民政府在劳资两利、公私兼顾的方针下，于四月二十八日由天津市人民银行以折实方式贷予矿方人民币三亿元，以解决矿方清理工资旧欠的困难。唐山矿已在五月四日开始发给了本年头三个月及去年十二月份所余五分之一的工资旧欠。但由于近来物价上涨，使矿方手头的现款只能发出上述旧欠的七成，其余三成经工人要求，矿方虽答应在五月八日发清，但是仍感到无力兑现。为此，又由天津市人民银行再次贷予三亿元，使其余的三成得以在八日按期开出，并发清了去年年底花红的尾欠部分。总计这次开支，使生活在困难中的开滦工人缓过了一口气。华北人民政府先后两次共贷款人民币六亿元，约占此次双方所发总额（包括职员一部分）的三分之二。自此次开支后，矿方对于工人的工资旧欠，即已还清。至于工资中的面粉则由于蒋贼死党扣船封锁，航运不通，面粉来源暂断，使双方所发四、五个月的面票未能兑面。据悉，华北人民政府还将贷予开滦煤矿一千二百万斤粗粮，来暂时解决这一问题。
