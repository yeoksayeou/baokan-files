    Chapter One: The Incident
    Three

    In October, General Lü Zhengcao's troops arrived, to the south, one station away from here. Li Ershu, a neighbor of the Daishui family, came back from selling cloth at the Gaoyang market and said, "The Red Army is here!" The old man said triumphantly, "The 'Red Army' is different from those eating and drinking troops. They wear coarse cloth and eat millet. They fight the Japanese, love the people, and have rounded up or annihilated the bandits in that area." He raised his thumb and said, "This is a real army! If you want to fight the Japanese, join them. Joining the eating and drinking troops will make you a heretic." The same news spread everywhere, and soon many young men rushed to Gaoyang to join the army. The "He Village Gang," fearing that the "Red Army" would剿 (suppress), transformed themselves into a self-defense force. A company commander of the Central Army, nicknamed Guo San Mazi (Pockmarked Guo the Third), was also a Kuomintang member. He escaped from the railway and mixed in here, and He Shixiong appointed him deputy commander. The two colluded and became local emperors in this area.

    At this time, Niu Daishui was still eagerly waiting for the wedding. His cousin-in-law didn't want to tell them the truth. As time went on, Daishui also estimated that there was no hope. The family had more expenses than income. They couldn't make ends meet, and often couldn't open the pot. Daishui felt very upset and said to his father in a sullen mood, "These are terrible times! I can't keep my mouth shut, and I might as well join the army!" His father said, "You've also gone astray! Be content and do your job well. Marry a wife someday..." Daishui impatiently said, "Don't mention it! Even if I don't shave my head for the rest of my life, I'll just be a hairy monk. I'd rather join the army!" His father was so angry that he knocked him on the head with his pipe and said, "You little rascal! I don't want you to join the army, but you insist on saying it, you insist on saying it!" Daishui pouted and went to bed in a huff.

    Unexpectedly -- his cousin returned.

    Daishui went to see his cousin, but his cousin wasn't home. His cousin-in-law said, "As soon as he came back, he threw down his bedding and went visiting." Daishui wanted to find him. His cousin-in-law said, "No need to look, he's probably gone to Liu Shuangxi's place. He'll be home for dinner soon." Daishui waited for a while, and his cousin finally came back.

    His cousin's surname was Cai, and people called him Cai the Blacksmith, or Black Cai. Daishui hadn't seen him for a long time, but he looked as strong and "robust" as ever, with a dark face, a smiling expression, and a bristly beard. His clothes were very worn, but his spirits were high. He spoke warmly to Daishui. Neighbors, relatives, and friends, hearing that he had returned, also came to visit. Black Cai was a well-known upright person, and everyone loved to meet and talk with him. The two small rooms were packed.

    At this time, the "Kuomintang-Communist Cooperation" was in effect, and the world had changed. Black Cai no longer hid. He reported the news of the war to everyone and spoke of many great truths about saving the country, such as "Down with Japanese imperialism," "National mobilization," and "Improving people's lives"... Wow! A whole set of new things that no one had ever heard before. People listened with great interest.

    Later, when everyone had left, Daishui was still sitting there. His cousin looked at him with bright eyes and suddenly said, "Daishui, let me ask you, are you willing to be a slave to a foreign power?" Daishui said, "Who would want to be! It's not good to be a slave to a foreign power. Didn't you say so!" His cousin walked to his side and said in a low voice, "Good, if you don't want to be a slave to a foreign power, then work with me! Let's form a self-defense force. When the Japanese come, we'll fight them!" Daishui had listened to Black Cai for a long time, but he still didn't quite believe it. He said, "We're empty-handed, how can we beat them?" His cousin smiled and said, "Don't be afraid of thousands of devils, only fear the people rising up slowly. As long as the people rise up, there's no way we can't win! Don't worry about weapons, we have plenty. You can help me get them back tomorrow, okay?" Daishui was a little flustered for a moment, and said hesitantly, "Okay... but I have some work in the field tomorrow..." His cousin smiled and said, "Don't worry! I'll go with you. If we two brothers go, no one will notice, it's guaranteed to be fine." Daishui hesitated for a while and said, "If we go, I have to talk to my father." His cousin shook his head and patted him on the shoulder, "Brother, don't tell him! If you tell him, you won't be able to go, and it might ruin things." He leaned close to Daishui's ear and taught him a way. Daishui listened, thought for a moment, and laughed, "That'll work, let's do that." Black Cai encouraged him a few more times, and Daishui went home.

    The next day, the cousins carried two loads of fish baskets, one in front of the other. People asked, "Where are you going?" Black Cai casually replied, "Doing a little business - hoarding some fish." The two left the village and walked along the embankment for a while, then his cousin led him west. At dusk, they crossed the Fu River and arrived at Hexi Village. They went to a house, and an old woman opened the door. His cousin said, "We're here to get something." The white-haired old woman held a lamp and led him into a shed. She uncovered a stack of firewood, revealing two burlap sacks. Opening them, they were full of hand grenades; large and small, there were two or three hundred of them, filling four baskets, tightly covered with lotus leaves. They drank some water, ate some steamed buns, and his cousin and the old woman spoke softly for a while. Then the two picked up their loads and hurried back through the night.

    On the way, Daishui quietly asked his cousin, "Who gave us so many bombs?" His cousin smiled and said, "No one gave them to us. These are hand grenades, we picked them up. When the Central Army scattered and ran, they left behind a lot of weapons in this area! A group of us also picked up many big guns and pistols, and handed them over to Commander Lü. We're going to use these hand grenades to build a country! Hey, you watch."

    The two returned to the village at the third crow of the rooster. Shuangxi was waiting for them at the school; the school had long been empty since the incident. Liu Shuangxi was a weaver who also farmed "a small patch of land." He was thin and very clever, and he had already dug two pits in the teachers' office by himself. The three quietly hid the hand grenades and then went back to sleep.

    Four

    In just a few days, Black Cai had secretly contacted ten or so young men, and they met in the school every night, and they put up the sign "Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force". They also spread rumors everywhere, saying, "Commander Lü has issued several dozen 'insert-lock boxes' (pistols). Whoever opposes the Anti-Japanese war, we'll take care of them!"

    Daishui worked during the day and followed his cousin at night, and felt very "good". His father said to him, "What madness are you up to?" He said, "I'm doing the anti-Japanese war!" His father said, "The Central Army, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, couldn't resist and slipped away without a hair left. How much ability do you have to resist?" Daishui was stumped, and stubbornly retorted, "What if we don't resist? Let me be a slave to a foreign power?" This time his father was stumped again, and stared at him speechless. Daishui took another step forward and said, "If you don't let me do it, I'll go out and join the army!" His father was afraid that he would join the army, so his heart softened, and he said sullenly, "Watch out that you're led by the nose by others. Anyway, I can't control you, do whatever you want!" Daishui happily ran out again.

    When Shen Yaozong saw Black Cai return, leading a group of people, making a lot of noise, he was worried that they were doing Communism, and he was very uneasy. Coincidentally, a few of his security team members returned, and he felt emboldened again, and wanted to suppress these people. But he also heard that they had guns, so he sent the village guard Cui ＠碌 Xian to scout out the situation.

    That night, Cui ＠碌 sneaked into the school to eavesdrop, and was discovered by Gao Tun'er, who was guarding the Self-Defense Force. Although Gao Tun'er was young, he was very tall. He hid in the dark and shouted in a loud voice, "Who's there? I'll shoot if you don't speak!" Cui ＠碌 thought he really had a gun and was so scared that he didn't dare to speak or run. Gao Tun'er took him into the room to see Black Cai. Cui ＠碌 was scared in his heart. As soon as he entered the door, he lowered his hands and made a pitiful face, saying, "Master Cai, Mr. Cai! Please don't shoot. I'm just working for someone! It's not easy to work for someone, it's not easy to be free, I... I have no choice!" Black Cai questioned him kindly, but he didn't tell the truth. Black Cai got angry, and when he threatened him, he ＠碌ed his eyes and told the truth, word for word, about what Shen Yaozong had told him to do. Black Cai thought it was funny; he pointed to the two cabinets containing hand grenades and said, "We have plenty of box guns and hand grenades! Go back and tell Shen Yaozong to be honest, we welcome him to resist the Japanese; if he continues to scheme behind our backs like this, we'll fight him!" Cui ＠碌 agreed repeatedly and withdrew.

    Black Cai and his men discussed countermeasures overnight. The next afternoon, each member of the Self-Defense Force stuffed his waist with hand grenades, some using belts to tighten them, some using bands to wrap them. Each person also took a small broom, wrapped it in cloth, hung it on his butt, covered it with a jacket, pretending to be a box gun. Some carried their bird guns on their backs. They lined up and walked down the street, singing the "March of the Volunteers":

    Arise,
    Ye who refuse to be slaves!
    With our flesh and blood
    Let us build our new Great Wall…

    As they walked, they shouted slogans very impressively. Niu Daishui was always afraid that people would see that the gun behind his butt was fake, so he touched it with his hand every now and then, and turned his head to look, fearing that the broom bump would fall out. They patrolled several streets like this. When they arrived at the village office, they crowded in, filling half the room with a dark mass. (Attached image)

    Black Cai and Niu Daishui uncovered a stack of firewood and took out many hand grenades.
    Black Cai led the Self-Defense Force in a demonstration, going to the village office.

    第一回　事变
    三
    十月，吕正操将军的队伍上来了，在南边，离这儿一站路。大水家邻舍有个李二叔，赶高阳集卖布回来，说：“红军来啦！”这老头儿得意的讲，“红军”跟这些吃喝队可不一样，穿的粗布，吃的小米；打日本，爱百姓，把那一带土匪收的收，剿的剿了。他翘着大姆指，说：“这才是正式军头呢！要想打日本，参加这个去。入了吃喝队，可就成了邪派啦。”同样的消息到处传，马上有好些小伙子，奔高阳投军去了。“何庄班”怕“红军”剿他们，就摇身一变，变成自卫团。有个中央军的连长，外号郭三麻子，也是个国民党员，从铁路上逃下来，在这儿混，何世雄封了他个副团长。他两个互相利用，在这一带当起土皇上来了。
    这时候，牛大水可还在巴巴的等着结亲呢。表嫂不好跟他们说实话，日子长了，大水也估摸着没指望了。家里又是出项多，进项少。怎么也熬不出头；日子过得紧紧巴巴的，常揭不开锅。大水觉得很不顺心，气闷闷的对爹说：“这年头真够瞧！嘴又不能挂起来，还不抵我去当兵呢？”老爹说：“你也入了邪！快安分守己，巴结着好好干；赶明儿娶了媳妇……”大水不耐烦的说：“别提了！一辈子不剃头，也不过是个连毛僧。我还不如去当兵哩！”老爹气得拿烟袋锅子敲他的脑袋说：“你这个小兔嵬子！不让你当兵，你偏说，你偏说！”大水噘着嘴，闷着头儿睡觉了。
    想不到--表哥回来了。
    大水去看表哥，表哥可不在家。表嫂说：“他一回来，扔下铺盖卷儿就串门子去了。”大水想去找他。表嫂说：“不用找，他多半是到刘双喜那儿去了，一会儿就回家吃饭。”大水等了一阵，表哥才回来了。
    表哥姓蔡，人都叫他蔡铁匠，也叫他黑老蔡。多时不见，大水看他还是那样粗壮，那样“棒”，脸儿黑不溜、笑迷迷，连鬓胡子毛楂楂的。他衣裳很破，精神很好，亲热的和大水说话。街坊邻舍，亲戚朋友，听说他回来了，也都来看望。黑老蔡是个有名的正直人，谁都爱和他见个面，说个话儿；两间小屋里就挤得满满的啦。
    这会儿“国共合作”，世事变了，黑老蔡也不再躲躲藏藏的了。他把战争的消息报告给大家，还说了许多救国的大道理，什么“打倒日本帝国主义”啦，什么“全国人民总动员”啦，还说要“改善人民生活”……吓！一套一套的，都是没听过的新鲜话儿呀，人们听得怪起劲儿。
    后来人散了，大水还坐在那儿没走。表哥烁亮的眼睛望着他，忽然说：“大水，我问你，你愿意当亡国奴吗？”大水说：“谁愿意呀！当亡国奴不好受，你不是说了吗！”表哥走到他身边，低声说：“好，不愿意当亡国奴，就跟我干！咱们成立自卫队，日本子来了，就跟他打！”大水刚才听黑老蔡说了半天，可还有些不相信，说：“咱们赤手空拳，打得过人家？”表哥笑着说：“不怕鬼子千万千，就怕百姓起来慢。只要老百姓起来了，没个打不赢！武器也不用愁，咱们有的是；你明儿就帮我去弄回来，行不行？”大水一时有些慌乱，吞吞吐吐的说：“行倒行……就是明天我地里有点活儿……”表哥笑了一笑，说：“不用怕！我跟你一块儿去。咱哥俩走一遭，谁也不注意，保险没事儿。”大水迟疑了一会，说：“要去得和我爹说说。”表哥摇摇头，拍着他的肩膀：“老弟，别跟他说！说了去不成，还怕坏了事儿。”就凑到大水耳朵边，低声教给他一个办法。大水听了，想了想，笑起来说：“这倒行喽，就这么着吧。”黑老蔡又鼓励了他几句，大水就回家了。
    第二天，表兄弟俩挑着两担鱼篓子，一前一后的走。人们问：“哪儿去呀？”黑老蔡随口答：“倒个小买卖--囤点鱼去。”两个人出了村，沿堤走了一阵，表哥就领着他往西奔。傍黑，他俩过了滏河，到了河西村。走到一家人家，一个老婆婆开了门。表哥说：“我们来拿东西了。”那白头发的老婆婆掌着灯，引他进了一间草棚子；扒开柴禾垛，露出两个麻袋，打开来，里面全是手榴弹；大大小小，足有二三百颗，装了满满四篓子，用荷叶盖严。他们喝了些水，吃了些饽饽，表哥和老婆婆低低说了一阵话，两个人就挑上担子，连夜往回赶。
    路上，大水悄悄问表哥：“这么些炸弹，都是谁给的？”表哥笑着说：“谁也没给。这是手榴弹，都是我们拾来的。中央军撒丫子跑，这一带丢下的武器可多呢！我们一伙人还拾了好些个大枪手枪，都交给吕司令了。咱们凭这些手榴弹，就要打江山！嗨，你瞧着吧。”
    两个人回到村里，已经鸡叫三遍了。双喜正在学堂等他们；学堂在事变以后早就没人了。刘双喜是个织布工人，捎带种着“巴掌大一块地”；这人瘦瘦的，很机灵，独个儿在教员室里已经挖好两个坑。三个人悄悄的把手榴弹藏好，才回去睡觉。
    四
    只几天工夫，黑老蔡就暗里连络了十来个小伙子，天天晚上在学堂开会，把“抗日自卫队”的牌子也亮出去了。还到处吹风，说：“吕司令给发了好几打‘插锁盒子’，谁要反对抗日，就把谁拾掇了！”
    牛大水白天干活，晚上跟着表哥闹腾，觉得很“得”。他爹说他：“你撒什么疯呀？”他说：“闹抗日啊！”老爹说：“中央军几十万还抗不住，溜得一根毛毛也没剩，你有多大能耐，你就能抗啊？”大水给问住了，就硬着头皮顶他：“不抗怎么着？让我当亡国奴啊？”这下老爹又给问住了，瞪着眼儿说不出话。大水紧一步说：“你不叫我干，我出外当兵去！”老爹怕他当兵，心就软了，嘴上堵气的说：“看你叫人家穿着鼻子走，反正我管不了你，你爱怎么就怎么吧！”大水又兴头头的跑出去了。
    申耀宗见黑老蔡回来，领着一拨人，折腾得挺欢，怕他们闹共产，心里很嘀咕。刚好他手下保卫团的团丁回来了几个，他腰巴子又硬了，就想压一压这些人。可又听说他们有枪，就派乡丁崔＠碌先去探探虚实。
    晚上，崔＠碌悄悄溜到学堂偷听，给自卫队站岗的高屯儿发现了。高屯儿年纪虽轻，个子可长得很高。他藏在暗处，拉开大嗓门吼了一声：“谁？不言声可开枪啦！”崔＠碌以为他真有枪，吓得不敢说话，也不敢跑。高屯儿就把他带到屋里去见黑老蔡。崔＠碌心里害怕，一进门就垂着手儿，作出一付可怜相，说：“蔡师傅，蔡先生！你们可别打枪。我这是给人家当差啊！当差不自在，自在不当差，我……我这也是没办法呀！”黑老蔡好言好语盘问他，他不说实话。黑老蔡生气了，一吓唬他，他才＠碌着眼珠子，把申耀宗吩咐他的话，一句句照实说了。黑老蔡觉得好笑；指着那两个装手榴弹的坐柜说：“盒子枪手榴弹可有的是！你回去告诉申耀宗，叫他老老实实的，咱们欢迎他抗日；要再这么背地里鼓捣，我们就跟他干！”崔＠碌一叠连声的答应着，退出去了。
    黑老蔡他们连夜商量对付的办法。第二天下午，自卫队每人腰里掖满了手榴弹，有的用皮带勒着，有的用褡膊缠着。各人还拿一把小笤帚，用布包好，吊在屁股上，用袄盖着，冒充盒子枪。有的把打鸟的火枪背起来。他们排了队，走在街上，唱着“义勇军进行曲”：
    起来，
    不愿作奴隶的人们！
    把我们的血肉，
    筑成我们新的长城…
    他们一路走着，还很威风的喊口号。牛大水老怕人家看出他屁股后面是假枪，一会儿用手摸摸，一会儿扭过头看看，生怕那笤帚疙瘩掉出来。这么着转游了几条街。到了村公所，一拥进去，黑压压的挤了半屋子。（附图片）
    黑老蔡和牛大水扒开柴禾垛，拿出许多手榴弹。
    黑老蔡领着自卫队，游行示威，到村公所去。
