A Few Words
　　Production Inspection Teams Go to the Countryside

The experience of organizing inspection teams to go to the countryside to inspect production in various parts of Taihang is very good. Leading production is not just about issuing instructions, setting plans, and reading reports. Especially since some district and village cadres do not yet know how to lead production, they will not discover problems, and naturally, they will not report problems to the leading organs in a timely manner.

Therefore, to understand the progress of production and the problems that exist, it is necessary to personally go deep into the inspection. Only then can we know whether the plan is appropriate for the actual situation, whether the district and village cadres have truly solved the various difficulties in the mass production. Whether there are coercive orders or even false reporting of figures from the leadership, whether the completion of the task is based on the conscious and voluntary efforts of the masses, and what urgent problems remain to be solved... Otherwise, even if the leadership wants to effectively push production forward, they will not be able to grasp the key points and will not know where to start.

　　三言两语
　　生产检查团下乡
    太行各地组织检查团，下乡检查生产，这一经验很好。领导生产并不就只是发指示、订计划、看报告。特别是有些区村干部还不会领导生产，他们不会发现问题；自然更不会及时把问题报告给领导机关。
    所以，要想了解生产的进度和存在的问题，必须亲自下手深入检查。然后才能知道计划订得是否恰合实际，区村干部是否真正解决了群众生产中的各种困难。领导上有无强迫命令甚至假报数字现象，任务的完成是否建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上，以及还有些什么急待解决的问题………否则即使领导上想有效的把生产推进一步，也抓不住重点，无从下手。
