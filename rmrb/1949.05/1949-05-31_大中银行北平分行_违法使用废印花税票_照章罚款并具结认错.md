　　Da Zhong Bank's Beiping Branch
  　Illegally Used Invalid Stamp Tax Tickets
  　Fined According to Regulations and Signed a Statement Acknowledging Error
    [Our Newspaper's Report] While inspecting stamp taxes in various shops, the Fourth Branch of the Beiping Municipal Tax Bureau discovered that the Da Zhong Bank's Beiping Branch, located at the western entrance of Dongjiaomin Lane, had reused invalidated stamps. The twenty-yuan stamp tax ticket affixed to current deposit account number 750 (belonging to Tianli Zeng Store) was a used, invalidated stamp. This violates the Stamp Tax Law. Therefore, the branch has been ordered to sign a statement acknowledging the error and has been fined two thousand four hundred yuan, one hundred and twenty times the original amount, according to regulations.
