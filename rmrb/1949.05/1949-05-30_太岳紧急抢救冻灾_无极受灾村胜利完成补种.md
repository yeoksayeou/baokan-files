    Taiyue Region Urgently Rescues from Frost Disaster;
    Wuji's Affected Villages Successfully Complete Replanting

    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Taiyue northern area's seedlings have suffered from frost damage, and the District Party Committee and Administrative Office are making every effort to rescue them. On May 13th and 14th, the climate in various counties in northern Yue suddenly turned cold. In counties such as Qinyuan and Anze, the river water froze to a thickness of more than two fingers. In Qinxian County, the autumn seedlings that had emerged in more than thirty villages along the riverbank were almost entirely killed by the frost. In order to rescue the frost disaster, the District Party Committee immediately mobilized all forces to lead the masses in destroying the old and replanting, and made the following decisions: 1. All affected counties should immediately convene emergency meetings of all Party, government, military, and civilian cadres to discuss and study specific measures to rescue the frost disaster, making it the sole central task at present. 2. Organize men, women, old, and young to urgently mobilize to carry out replanting and destruction, and overcome pessimistic and disappointed sentiments. 3. Call on the masses to help each other, with unaffected areas helping affected areas, and those with lighter damage helping those with heavier damage, to solve difficulties such as seeds, fertilizers, manpower, and livestock. Banks can lend some money to buy bean cake, sesame cake and other fertilizers. 4. All cadres of various levels of organs, except for a few who remain behind, should go to the countryside to complete the urgent task of destroying the old and replanting. Various counties are now organizing the masses to carry out this work.

    [Jizhong News] The Wuji County Party Committee personally led cadres to the hail-stricken areas to guide the masses in replanting. They completed all replanting in three days, exceeding the original planting of cotton by more than thirty mu. On the afternoon of the 16th, the county suddenly experienced a hailstorm, affecting thirteen villages. Most of the cotton was destroyed, and wheat fields and other seedlings were also damaged. After the disaster, the County Party Committee and County Head immediately dispatched cadres to the affected villages to carry out emergency planting of cotton and peanuts. From the 17th to the 19th, in three days, they completed the sowing of 1,044 mu of cotton, exceeding the original cotton planting by 33.5 mu. Hou Beijiao Village had a total of 255.5 mu of cotton destroyed by hail. The most severely damaged 228.3 mu were all replanted with cotton, and the less severely damaged 27.2 mu were also completely re-seeded. The 13 mu of sorghum that were damaged were also replanted with cotton, and another 4 mu of cotton were planted on previously uncultivated land. After the disaster, the village not only did not reduce the amount of cotton, but instead planted 17 mu more. Hu Fulai, the director of the Ma Village Farmers' Association, and Xing Linshun and other seven households helped each other to destroy the damaged cotton. They had a total of four head of livestock, with one plowing, one harrowing, and one planting in sequence. They replanted more than 20 mu of cotton in half a day. The director of the Farmers' Association said, "It (referring to the hail) destroyed it quickly, but we planted it even faster..." Now these disaster-stricken villages have all victoriously completed the destruction and replanting of cotton, and are continuing to plant peanuts. The masses' enthusiasm for production is very high.
