　　Old Red Army Returns!
  　Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi People Rejoice; Assist the PLA in Suppressing Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 23rd] When the People's Liberation Army arrived at the old revolutionary base areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi during the Land Revolution era, the local people spread the news, saying: "The Old Red Army has returned!" "Chairman Mao's troops have returned!" As soon as the PLA's vanguard troops arrived in the area of Qigong Town in Yiyang, the hometown of Red Army martyr Fang Zhimin, many people came from afar to recount the suffering inflicted upon them by the Kuomintang bandits over the years, as well as the heroic and unyielding struggles of the people. They pointed to the preferential treatment certificates for Red Army families and the banknotes of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Provincial People's Bank, which had been preserved for more than a decade, and said: "The Kuomintang would behead anyone found keeping these, but we believed that you would definitely return." Women brought basket after basket of eggs, bamboo shoots, and dried fruits to comfort the long-awaited troops. Groups of them found the encampments to wash clothes and make military shoes for the PLA. When the unit set off to clear out the Kuomintang bandits, many farmers along the way eagerly volunteered to join them. Those who were transplanting rice seedlings didn't even bother to put on shoes and followed barefoot. During the mopping-up operation against looting bandits in Xishan Village, dozens of farmers closely followed the assault team into battle, capturing the bandit company commander and a group of bandits in one fell swoop. Before long, the battlefield beside the village immediately transformed into a gathering of soldiers and civilians, with men and women, young and old, happily surrounding the PLA soldiers, saying: "The sky has cleared! The sky has cleared!"

　　老红军回来啦！
  　闽浙赣人民欢腾　协助解放军剿匪
    【新华社浙赣前线二十三日电】人民解放军进抵土地革命时代闽浙赣老解放区时，当地人民奔走相告：“老红军回来啦！”“毛主席的队伍回来啦！”解放军先头部队刚刚到达红军先烈方志敏同志的家乡弋阳漆工镇一带，许多人民便从远道赶来诉说多年来国民党匪帮给他们的苦难及人民英勇不屈的斗争事迹，他们指着保存了十几年的红军家属优待证和闽浙赣省人民银行的钞票说：“国民党查到谁保存这个就要杀头，可是我们相信你们一定要回来的。”妇女们提着一筐筐的鸡蛋、竹笋、干果慰劳久别重逢的队伍，成群结队找到宿营地，给解放军洗衣裳，做军鞋。该部出发清剿国民党匪军时，沿途许多农民都争着随同前去。正在插秧的顾不上穿鞋就赤着脚跟上了。在西山村清剿抢掠的匪军时，几十个农民紧随着突击队投入战斗，将匪军连长等一群匪徒一举擒获。不一会，村边的战场立即变成了军民联欢的会场，全村男女老幼乐得围着解放军战士们说：“天晴了！天晴了！”
