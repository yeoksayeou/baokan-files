[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] With the wheat harvest approaching, various counties and districts in the Fourth District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are universally carrying out mopping-up operations against bandits and special agents to protect production and stabilize social order. From April 15th to May 10th, incomplete statistics from only Junxian, Fengqiu, Yanjin, and Yuanyang counties show that 264 scattered bandits were captured, and 25 machine guns, 376 rifles and pistols, 2 submachine guns, 1 small cannon, 11,900 rounds of ammunition, 11 horses, and some grain and cloth were seized. Pseudo-personnel have been registering with our government to repent. According to statistics from the above four counties, the number of those who repented reached 251. Currently, the mopping-up work in various counties and districts is still continuing.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] Weihe, Shanghe, Qingfeng and other counties in the Eighth District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are actively rectifying the people's armed forces, and social order is gradually stabilizing. Since the Military Region's People's Armed Forces Department issued spring work instructions, various counties have successively held meetings of militia cadres and militiamen to convey the spring work instructions and to examine the erroneous attitudes of cadres who abandoned leadership and lacked education regarding the militia. For example, when Shanghe's Fifth District held a militia meeting, the militiamen from the east and west sub-districts who attended the meeting brought 42 guns, none of which had been cleaned. The militiamen said, "The guns are not needed." Since the meeting, the sense of responsibility of the cadres has been improved, the pacifist and paralyzed thinking of the militia has been corrected, the situation has been clarified, and education on stabilizing social order and taking the lead in production has been conducted. After reorganization, the militia strengthened its organization and improved its morale. For example, the militia in most villages in the Third District collectively patrol at night. Theft cases rarely occur. The militia of Wanglou Zhoujia in Qingfeng's Third District is responsible for guarding the power lines every night to ensure that they are not sabotaged by special agents. They also challenged other sub-districts. When Weihe convened a militia meeting, after everyone discussed in groups, a production plan was formulated to ensure the completion of the cotton planting task. At the same time, villages also stipulated methods for mutual inspection and mutual supervision.

　　冀鲁豫四分区
  　清剿匪特保卫麦收
  　八分区整顿民兵安定社会秩序
    【冀鲁豫电】目前各地麦收将到，为保卫生产安定社会秩序，冀鲁豫四分区各县、区普遍展开清剿匪特工作。自四月十五日至五月十日，仅浚县、封邱、延津、原阳四个县不完全统计，即俘获散匪二百六十四人，激获机枪二十五挺，长短枪三百七十六支，冲锋枪两支，小炮一门，子弹一万一千九百发，马十一匹，其他粮食布匹一部。伪人员纷纷到我政府登记悔过。据上述四个县的统计，悔过者即达二百五十一人。现各县区清剿工作仍在继续开展中。
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫八专区卫河、尚和、清丰等县积极整顿人民武装，社会秩序渐趋安定。自军区人民武装部发出春季工作指示后，各县先后召开民兵干部及民兵会议，传达春季工作指示，并检查干部中对民兵放弃领导、缺乏教育的错误态度。如尚和五区召开民兵会议时，东西小区参加会议的民兵，带有四十二枝枪，没有一枝是擦过的。民兵说：“枪用不着了。”自开会后，提高了干部责任心，纠正了民兵的太平麻痹思想，讲明了形势，进行安定社会秩序及带头生产的教育。民兵经过整理，健全组织，提高了情绪。如三区大部村庄的民兵，均在晚上集体打更巡逻。偷盗案很少发生。清丰三区王楼周家民兵每天晚上负责看电线，保证不叫特务破坏。还向别的小区挑战。卫河召集民兵会议时，经过大家分组讨论，订出生产计划，保证完成种棉任务。同时村与村又规定了互相检查、互相督促的办法。
