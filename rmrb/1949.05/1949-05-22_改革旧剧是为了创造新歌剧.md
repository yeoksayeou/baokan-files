　　Reforming Old Operas to Create New Operas
　　Liu Nianqu
　　Fundamentally, the issue of how to reform old operas should be the issue of how to create new operas through the reform of old operas, that is, the issue of how to discard the old to bring forth the new.
　　This issue includes three main aspects: how to write new scripts (including adapting old scripts), how to create new performance forms, and how to transform old artists. These three main aspects are interconnected and indispensable. Having new scripts, but not creating new performance forms or having old artists perform in the traditional way, will inevitably hinder or harm the new content; creating new performance forms must be based on new content and be sufficient to appropriately express the new content, and it also requires old artists to be good at understanding, mastering, and participating in the creation; transforming old artists should be carried out in the practice of reforming old operas, that is, requiring old artists to transform themselves by actively participating in the reform work. At present, what needs to be discussed in depth and resolved in practice is how to create new performance forms. A reasonable solution to this problem is the only way to achieve discarding the old to bring forth the new.
　　Undeniably, old opera is a major branch of feudal literature and art. It richly and clearly reflects feudal consciousness. Fatalistic thinking, the trinity of monarchical power, patriarchal power, and husbandly power, and the thinking of slaves fill various subject scripts, becoming tools for the feudal rulers to "educate" (numb, deceive, and hoodwink) the broad masses of the oppressed over a long period. Scripts that express the spirit of resistance of the oppressed are few in number and have certain limitations. For example, Xiao En in "Fisherman's Revenge" only resists corrupt officials and local tyrants, and cannot touch their masters or the social system that produced them; historical peasant uprisings were invariably treated as rebellious "bandits." Such old operas not only completely deviate from the revolutionary reality and distort history, but also play a counter-revolutionary role, either strongly or weakly.
　　The content reflecting feudal consciousness inevitably has a form that adapts to express it, and this is the stylization of old opera. The so-called stylization is the extreme development in the form of expression from realism to freehand, from concrete to abstract, when the content development reaches a certain limit and stagnates, which is precisely the reflection of the long-term stagnation of Chinese feudal society in art. The degree of stylization is inconsistent between Peking Opera, which was formed after the Four Great Anhui Troupes entered Beijing and the court during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, and local operas, and is also inconsistent among various local operas. Comparatively speaking, Peking Opera is the most refined, with its own rigorous rules. It has absorbed and integrated a large number of Kunqu opera techniques, and in the past thirty years or so, it has given considerable influence to local operas. The performance of Sichuan Opera's famous actress Tian Lai is already different from ordinary Sichuan Opera, which can be taken as an example. This highly developed and rigid stylization has turned into a shackle for the development of the content of old opera.
　　Therefore, to reform old operas and perform scripts with new content, the first thing is to break this shackle, utilize certain parts, and prevent the new content from being hindered or harmed by this shackle. This is discarding the old. Content determines form, and new content inevitably requires new forms. This is possible. Starting from the reform of old operas, new forms will be created in the practice of critically absorbing and applying certain parts of old opera and constantly expanding and developing. This is bringing forth the new.
　　The practical experience of the past seven or eight years has told us that there are two different paths starting from two different points. One path is from Yangko to New Yangko Opera to "The White Haired Girl," and the other path is from Peking Opera to New Peking Opera. The starting point of the former path is the local opera, Yangko, which is not very refined in its stylization. It has the convenience of accommodating new content. The old form is also easily broken through by the new content, and it is also easy to further expand and develop according to the rules of its old form to create new forms that express new content, in order to enter a higher stage and produce new Chinese operas, people's operas. The starting point of the latter path is Peking Opera, which is the most refined in its stylization. Its rules are rigorous and difficult to break through, and without a thorough breakthrough, future development has certain limitations.
　　Due to the existence of this limitation, and because the old rules have not been thoroughly broken, there is such a view: reformed Peking Opera (or New Peking Opera) is suitable for expressing historical subjects. If this history is still the old viewpoint, centered on emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, then there is no problem. However, everyone knows that the history we are talking about is the history of the people, the history created by the labor of the people, and the problem is not so simple. To correctly reflect history and express the broad masses of the working people as the real protagonists, "four green robes" or "four assistants," or a dozen or twenty men and women, old and young, dressed as *sheng*, *dan*, *jing*, and *chou*, are completely inadequate. This requires another design – creation.
　　What about modern subjects? Can a martial *sheng* (or old *sheng*) wearing armor and carrying four generals, four assistants, and four dragon extras represent the People's Liberation Army? No. Can a dozen or twenty men and women, old and young, dressed as *sheng*, *dan*, *jing*, and *chou* represent the peasants who have turned over in the land reform? No. This is not a question of clothing or makeup. Mainly, the characters that the old forms can express are already very different from modern characters in essence. The People's Liberation Army is completely different from Zhao Yun and the like, and the peasants are no longer the "ants" in the eyes of emperors, bureaucrats, and landlords.
　　The problem is not just this. When most of the old artists have not been transformed, performing scripts with new content is often not appropriate. The more excellent the acting skills (old ones) are, the more likely their acting skills will hinder or harm the performance. Although this acting skill is only a technique, in reality, it is precisely a kind of extremely individualistic acting skill cultivated with the entire old opera system. We have seen "Nine Pieces of Clothing" (written by Cui Mu) performed entirely in the form of Peking Opera. On the stage, a peasant is no different from Wu Song or Shi Xiu, a peasant woman is no different from Su San or Dou E, and Li Zicheng's peasant armed forces are no different from Zhao Yun or Ma Chao. And their common point is to make individual acting skills cover up the content, and the audience still inevitably watches a certain actor without paying attention to the characters in the play. The theory that technology is separated from reality and from content has also appeared. Some people say: "Bring many things from the countryside to the city, refine them, and then send them back to the countryside" and "If Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu were to perform in the countryside today, it would not be a problem and they would be particularly welcome" and so on. The error of this theory is obvious.
　　So, does this mean that the road starting from the reform of Peking Opera is impassable? Not necessarily. This road can continue. However, workers (whether leaders or participants) must have such a basic understanding: First, reforming old operas starting from Peking Opera is by no means to inject a shot in the arm to Peking Opera to extend its life, or to make Peking Opera exist forever, but to enable it to cooperate with the revolutionary reality to a certain extent (at least not play a counter-revolutionary role), and to provide its parts that can be critically absorbed and used to create new operas. Second, at the beginning of the reform, we must comprehensively study Peking Opera, find out the development rules of Peking Opera, and promote its thorough reform according to this rule. Third, we must carry out destruction in the reform, break all the old shackles that may hinder or harm the new content, and try to create new forms; the parts that can be absorbed and utilized should also be expanded and developed. Fourth, when writing scripts with new content, we must break through that rigid format as much as possible and not be restricted by it at all. Fifth, the work of transforming old artists must be carried out simultaneously with the practice of performance, and it must be regarded as an important link in the work of reforming old operas, breaking the old artists' concept of seniority, the psychology of favoring personal skills, and the thinking of Peking Opera first. Furthermore, we must make the old artists become new artists, combine with the masses, and learn from the masses.
　　The road from Yangko to New Yangko Opera to "The White Haired Girl" was taken by workers who had such a basic understanding. From the Yangko of "flirtatious landlords" to "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" reflecting the new life, the form changed due to the different content, developing the lively, cheerful, bright, and powerful elements, which can be said to be the initial breakthrough of the old shackles. When "The White Haired Girl" was performed in Peiping, the form changed again due to the expansion of the content. Where the old form could not express, several new creations were tried, establishing the initial model of the new opera. It never stopped at a certain point, nor did it ever intentionally or unintentionally accommodate the old form. And all the people participating in this work are almost all workers who have been transformed and are being transformed. In this way, this instruction is fully embodied in practice: "The people demand popularization, and they also demand improvement, and they demand improvement year by year and month by month. Here, popularization is the popularization of the people, and improvement is also the improvement of the people, and this improvement is not an improvement in the air, not a closed-door improvement, but an improvement on the basis of popularization. This improvement is determined by popularization, and at the same time, it gives guidance to popularization."
　　According to this instruction, we can expect that from reforming old operas to creating new Chinese operas and new people's operas, there is full certainty.
　　Postscript: The problems touched upon in this article are only a part of what I have thought of so far, and are obviously not complete, let alone in-depth. Especially since I have not had the opportunity to see the performances of the North China Peking Opera Theatre, there may be some narrow views. I will write it out for discussion.

### 改革旧剧是为了创造新歌剧

　　改革旧剧是为了创造新歌剧
    刘念渠
    怎样改革旧剧的问题，在基本上，应该是怎样通过改革旧剧来创造新歌剧的问题，也就是怎样推陈出新的问题。
    这个问题，包括着如何编写新内容的剧本（连改编旧的剧本在内）、如何创造新的演出形式及如何改造旧艺人三项主要内容。这三项主要内容是相互连结着缺一不可的。有了新内容的剧本，不创造新的演出形式或由旧艺人依传统方法去表演，必然使新内容受到妨碍或伤害；创造新的演出形式，必需以新内容为依据并且足以适当的表现新内容，还要求旧艺人善于理解、掌握与参加创造；改造旧艺人则应该在改革旧剧的实践中去进行，即要求旧艺人在积极参加改革工作中进行改造自己。在目前，最需要深入讨论并在实践中予以解决的，乃是如何创造新的演出形式。这个问题有了合理的解决，才可以达到推陈出新。
    无可置辩的，旧剧是封建文艺的一个主要部门。他浓浴而明显的反映着封建意识，宿命论思想、君权父权夫权三位一体的思想与奴才思想充满了各种题材的剧本中，成为封建统治者长期“教化”（麻醉、欺骗、蒙蔽）广大被压迫者的工具。表现被压迫者反抗精神的剧本，为数既少，又有一定的限度。如“打渔杀家”里的萧恩所反抗的对象，只是贪官土豪，不曾也不能触及他们的主子和产生他们的社会制度；历史上的农民暴动则无一不是被当做大逆不道的“匪贼”来处理的。这样的旧剧，不仅完全脱离了革命现实并歪曲了历史，而且或强或弱的起着反革命作用。
    反映封建意识的内容，必然有着与它相适应的表现它的形式，这就是旧剧的程式化。所谓程式化，乃是内容发展到达一定限度而停滞之际，在表现形式上由写实到写意，由具体到抽象的极端发展，这正是中国封建社会长期停滞在艺术上的反映。程式化的程度，清乾隆年间四大徽班入北京进宫庭以后所形成的平剧与地方戏不一致，各种地方戏之间也不一致。比较起来，平剧是最精炼的，它有着自己的谨严的规律。它曾大量的吸收了并溶合了昆曲的技巧，而在近三数十年间又给地方戏以相当的影响，川剧名伶天籁的表演已经不同于一般川剧，可以为例。这种程式化高度发展而僵化，转而成为旧剧内容发展的桎梏了。
    因此，改革旧剧，演出新内容的剧本，首先要打破这种桎梏，利用某些部份，不使新内容被这种桎梏所妨碍或伤害。这就是推陈。内容决定形式，新内容必然要求新形式。这是可能的，从改革旧剧出发，新形式将在批判的吸收和运用旧剧的某些部份与不断的扩大和发展的实践中被创造出来。这就是出新。
    近七八年的实际经验曾告诉我们，这里有着由两个不同起点出发的两条道路。一条是从秧歌到新秧歌剧到“白毛女”的道路，一条是由平剧到新平剧的道路。前一条道路的起点，是程式化还不怎么精炼的地方剧——秧歌，它有着容纳新内容的便利，旧形式也很容易被新内容所突破，也很容易根据它的旧形式的法则进一步的扩大与发展，来创造表现新内容的新形式，以求进入更高的阶段，产生新中国的歌剧、人民的歌剧。后一条道路的起点，是程式化最精炼的平剧，它的规律谨严很难突破，而不去彻底的突破，未来的发展是有着一定的局限的。
    由于这种局限的存在，由于还不曾彻底的突破旧的规律，遂有着这样一种看法：改革了的平剧（或新平剧）适于表现历史题材。假如这历史仍旧是旧观点的、以帝王将相为中心的历史，那是什么问题也没有的。然而，谁都知道，我们所说的历史，是人民的历史，是人民劳动所创造的历史，问题就不那么简单了。正确的反映历史，将广大劳动人民做为真正主角来表现，“四青袍”或“四下手”，或凑上一二十个由生、旦、净、丑扮饰的男女老少，是完完全全不行的。这就得另外设计——创造。
    倘是现代题材呢？一个武生（或老生）披＠扎靠，带上四将官、四上手和四龙套，能否表现人民解放军呢？不能的。凑上一二十个由生、旦、净、丑扮饰的男女老少，能否表现在土改中翻身了的农民吗？不能的。这不是服装或化装的问题，主要的，旧形式能够表现的人物，在实质上，已经与现代人物大有距离了，人民解放军完全不同于赵云之类，农民也不是皇帝、官僚与地主眼中的“蚁民”了。
    问题还不仅此。在大多数的旧艺人尚未改造之际，演出新内容的剧本，往往不能恰到好处。越是演技（旧的）优秀的演员，越可能因他们的演技妨碍或伤害了演出。这种演技，虽然不过是技术，实际上恰恰是结伴着整个旧剧制度而培养出来的一种极端个人主义的演技。我们看过了完全以平剧形式演出的“九件衣”（崔牧本）。在舞台上，一个农民无殊于武松或石秀，一个农妇无殊于苏三或窦娥，李自成的农民武装队伍无殊于赵云或马超。而其共同点，则在使个人演技掩盖了内容，观众仍不免在看某一演员而不注意剧中人物。技术脱离现实并脱离内容的理论，也曾出现过。有人说：“把乡村许多东西带到城市里来，经过洗炼，再送回乡村去”及“今天如果让梅兰芳、程砚秋去乡下唱戏，不成问题的会被特别欢迎”云云。这种理论的错误，是显而易见的。
    如此说来，是不是以改革平剧为起点的道路就不通了呢？也不。这一条道路，是可以继续下去的。但是，工作者（无论是领导者还是参加者）必须具有这样的基本认识：第一，改革旧剧从平剧出发，绝不是为了给平剧注射一针强心剂而延续寿命，或者，给平剧永远存在，而是为了使它能够在某种程度内配合革命现实（至少不起反革命作用），并且提供其可以批判吸收和运用的部份以创造新歌剧。第二，在改革之始，即须全面研究平剧，找出平剧的发展规律，根据这一规律去促成它的彻底改革。第三，必须在改革中进行破坏，打破一切足以妨碍或伤害新内容的旧桎梏，试行创造新的形式；其可以吸收和运用的部份，也要予以扩大和发展。第四，编写新内容的剧本，必须在可能范围内突破那套死板板的格式，完全不受它的限制。第五，与演出实践同时进行改造旧艺人的工作，必须视之为改革旧剧工作中的一个重要环节，打破旧艺人的牌位观念、偏爱个人技术的心理，平剧第一的思想，更要进一步的使旧艺人成为一个新艺人，与群众结合，向群众学习。
    从秧歌到新秧歌剧到“白毛女”这一条道路，就是具备了这样基本认识的工作者们走过来的。由“骚情地主”的秧歌进到反映新的生活的“兄妹开荒”，形式因内容不同而一变，发展了其中生动、活泼、明朗、有力的因素，可以说是旧桎梏被初步突破了。及至在北平演出的“白毛女”，形式因内容扩大而再变，凡是旧形式所不能表现的，即试行若干新的创造，树立了新歌剧的最初的模式。它从不曾停留在某一点上，也从不曾有意无意的迁就旧形式。而所有参加这一工作的人们，几乎无一不是经过改造的和正在改造中的工作者。这样，也就是在实践中完全体现了这一指示：“人民要求普及，跟着也要求提高，要求逐年逐月的提高。在这里，普及是人民的普及，提高也是人民的提高，而这种提高，不是在空中提高，不是关门提高，而是在普及基础上的提高。这种提高，为普及所决定，同时又给普及以指导。”
    依据这一指示，我们可以预期，由改革旧剧到创造中国的新歌剧、人民的新歌剧，是有充分把握的。
    附记：本文所接触到的问题，只是我目前想到的一部份，显然不够完全，更不够深入。特别是在还没有机会看到华北平剧院的演出之际，可能有若干偏狭之见。姑且这么写出来，借供讨论。
