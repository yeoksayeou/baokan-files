    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 13th: TASS, The Hague - The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party issued a statement on the Indonesian situation, saying: The De Drees government's policy of attempting to suppress the Indonesian national liberation movement with military force has failed. The resistance of the broad masses of the Indonesian people is stronger than the Dutch government expected. In view of its failure, Dutch imperialism is uniting with American imperialism to engage in new conspiracies, attempting to use the help of the Hatta reactionary clique to attack the Indonesian national liberation movement. But there is reason to believe that the plans of Dutch and American imperialism will also fail. The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party said: Only when the Indonesian Republic is recognized as an independent country, the Dutch army withdraws from the territory of the Republic, political freedom and freedom of the trade union movement are restored, and a new republican government of the National Front, leading the struggle for Indonesian independence, is established, can peace in Indonesia be established. The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party reiterated its position of supporting the freedom-loving Indonesian people and called on the Dutch people to urge the De Drees government to withdraw Dutch troops stationed in Indonesia.

    号召人民力促政府撤退驻军
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社牙讯：荷兰共产党中央委员会发表对印尼局势的声明说：德里斯政府企图以军事力量镇压印尼民族解放运动的政策，业已失败。在印尼广大人民群众的抵抗，较荷兰政府预料的为强。鉴于自己的失败，荷兰帝国主义者乃联合美帝国主义从事新的阴谋，图斯哈达反动集团的帮助，打击印尼民族解放运动。可是有理由断定，荷美帝国主义的计划也将失败。荷共中央委员会说：只有印尼共和团被承认为独立国，荷军自共和国领土撤退，政治自由与职工运动的自由被恢复，领导印尼独立而斗争的民族阵线的新共和政府成立的时候，印尼的和平才能确立。荷共中央委员会重申其声援爱好自由的印尼人民的立场，并号召荷兰人民力促德里斯政府撤退驻印尼荷军。
