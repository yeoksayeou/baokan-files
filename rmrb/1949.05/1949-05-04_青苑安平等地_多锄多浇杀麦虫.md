[Jizhong Electric] In Qingyuan County, the yellow sand worm infestation in wheat fields has been largely eradicated. The most effective method of catching insects is watering and hoeing the wheat. Since the discovery of the yellow sand worm infestation on April 4th, the county party committee has instructed various districts and county cadres to go to the villages and vigorously lead the masses to capture and treat the infestation. Extensive publicity was launched in various villages, and the broad masses of farmers immediately took action. In Beiliugezhuang to Zhongmachi villages in the Fourth District, waterwheels and windlasses worked day and night. In order to kill the insects, they watered generously and used iron shovels to splash the water along the wheat furrows to drown the insects. In Xiaozhangzhuang Village in the Second District, all 21 waterwheels in the village watered the wheat together, first watering their own fields, and then pulling the waterwheels to other people's fields. After five days, all 261 mu of wheat fields in the village had been watered the first time, and they are currently watering the second time. Some villages in the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Districts have also finished watering the first time and are rushing to water the second time. In Libazhuang and other four villages in the Fifth District, canals were opened to divert water from the Qingshui River, and 2,820 mu of wheat fields have been watered the first time and are being watered the second time. Because the river water is convenient, and the watering is generous, the insects have been completely drowned. In areas with wells, the first watering has generally been completed, and the second watering is being rushed. The fields have also been hoed twice. The yellow sand worm infestation has been largely eradicated.
    [Jizhong Electric] Yancun Village, Eighth District, Anping County. Since the occurrence of fire spider mites in the wheat fields, county and district cadres have actively mobilized the masses to capture and treat them. In addition to holding meetings to conduct education and mobilizing students to carry out household publicity, a meeting of village cadres was also held to study methods of eradication. The general opinion was that cadres should take the lead in mobilizing the masses to form free groups and universally hoe the wheat. Subsequently, a mass meeting was held to call for action, and Vice Chairman Lu Xingzhou immediately organized three groups. He also proposed to intensify the efforts to ensure that people are busy hoeing. Production Committee member Sun Xiaofu and four other households also spontaneously organized themselves. After mobilization and organization, the whole village actively took action. According to one day's statistics, 166 men, women, and children were mobilized, hoeing a total of 433 mu of wheat (including 165 mu of wheat fields belonging to military families). Village cadres plan to universally hoe all 800 mu of wheat in the village within another day.

　　青苑安平等地
  　多锄多浇杀麦虫
    【冀中电】清苑麦田黄砂虫灾，现已大部扑灭。捕虫的最有效办法，是浇水锄麦。该县自四月四日发现黄砂虫灾后，县委指示各区及下乡县干部大力领导群众捕治，各村普遍展开宣传，广大农民并立即行动起来。四区北刘各庄到中马池一带村庄，水车、辘轳昼夜不停。为了杀虫，浇水大些，并用铁锨将水顺麦垄一泼，将虫淹死。二区小张庄全村二十一辆水车，一齐浇麦，先浇自己的，浇完把水车拉到别人地里去浇。经过了五天，全村二百六十一亩麦田已浇完了头水，并正在浇二水。一、四、五、八区部分村庄也都浇完了头水，正在浇二水。五区李八庄等四村，利用清水河开渠引水，已将二千八百二十亩麦田浇完头水，正在浇二水。因河水方便，浇的水大，已将虫完全淹死。在有井的地区，一般已浇完头水，正在赶浇二水。并锄过二遍。黄砂虫灾已大部扑灭。
    【冀中电】安平县八区严町村。自麦田发生火蛛子以后，县区干部积极发动群众捕治。除开会进行教育和发动学生进行家庭宣传外，又召开了村干部会议，研究治除办法。大伙的意见是干部带头发动群众自由结组，普遍锄麦。随后又召开了群众会进行号召，副主席鲁杏周当即组织起来了三组。并提出加紧突击，保证人闲锄不闲。生产委员孙小副等四户也自动的组织了起来。经过发动组织以后，全村积极行动起来，一天的统计，即发动了男女儿童一百六十六人，共锄麦子四百三十三亩（内有军属麦田一百六十五亩）。村干部计划再有一天即可把全村八百多亩麦子普遍锄完了。
