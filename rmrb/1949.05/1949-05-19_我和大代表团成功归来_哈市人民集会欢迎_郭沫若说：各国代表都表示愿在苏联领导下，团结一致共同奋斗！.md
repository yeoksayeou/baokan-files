　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th. The Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace arrived here on the 14th of this month. On the 15th, more than 50,000 representatives from various municipal organizations, groups, workers, students, and citizens from all walks of life held a grand welcome rally in Zhaolin Park. Harbin Mayor Rao Bin delivered a speech on behalf of the 800,000 citizens at the meeting to welcome the returning delegation and to celebrate the success of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. Following this, the head of the delegation, Guo Moruo, spoke, saying: "We went abroad at a time when we were achieving great victories at home. First of all, we felt that the international status of the Chinese people had been raised to an unprecedented level. We received warm and cordial welcomes in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. A red carpet was laid for us at the train station in Prague. We will never forget this deep friendship." Speaking of the international impact of the Chinese people's victory and the international honor of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese people, he said: "Mr. Yabi Yu Tang, the liaison representative from Africa sent by the Paris Congress to the Prague Congress, said in his speech at the Prague Congress: 'Mao Zedong is also the savior of the African people. With the liberation of the Chinese people, we Africans also have hope.' The head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Fadeev, said to the Chinese delegation: 'We proudly dare to say to any warmonger: The American and British imperialists have concluded the gangster-style North Atlantic Treaty, and Luxembourg, with a population of less than one million, has joined, while our World Peace Congress has the participation of 475 million Chinese people.'" Guo Moruo emphasized, "The success of the Peace Congress is due to the contributions of the people of all countries, especially the greatest contribution of the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace. This is the result of the unwavering peace policy of Stalin, the great teacher of mankind, which has awakened all peace-loving people in the world. The representatives of the 72 countries participating in the conference praised the Soviet Union and Stalin, and were willing to unite and work together under the leadership of the Soviet Union." Xu Deheng, Zheng Zhenduo, Ding Ling, and Chen Jiakang, who were also members of the delegation, also spoke at the meeting.

　　我和大代表团成功归来
  　哈市人民集会欢迎
    郭沫若说：各国代表都表示愿在苏联领导下，团结一致共同奋斗！
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】出席世界拥护和平大会的中国代表团于本月十四日到达此间后，十五日市内各机关、团体代表及工人、学生和各界市民五万余人于兆麟公园举行了盛大的欢迎会。哈尔滨市长饶斌代表八十万市民在大会上致词表示欢迎出国归来的代表团，并庆祝世界拥护和平大会的成功。接着代表团团长郭沫若讲话，他说：“我们在国内获得伟大胜利之时出国，首先觉得中国人民的国际地位空前提高了，我们在苏联和捷克都受到了热烈而亲切的欢迎。布拉格的火车站为我们铺上了红毯。这种深厚的友谊使我们永远也不会记记。”在谈到中国人民的胜利在国际上的影响以及中国人民领袖毛主席和中国人民在国际上的荣誉时说：“巴黎大会派遣到布拉格大会的联络代表非洲的黑人亚毕攸唐先生在布拉格大会上发言时说：‘毛泽东同时是非洲人民的救星，中国人民得到解放，我们非洲也就有了希望。’苏联代表团团长法捷耶夫先生对中国代表团说：‘我们夸耀地敢同任何战争贩子说：美英帝国主义缔结了强盗式的北大西洋公约，得到一个人口不足一百万的卢森堡参加，而我们世界和平大会得到了人口四万万七千五百万的中国参加’。”郭沫若加重语气说：“主张和平大会的成功，各国人民都有贡献，尤其是世界和平堡垒苏联有最大的贡献。这是人类伟大导师斯大林的坚定不移的和平政策，把全世界爱好和平人民唤醒了的结果。参加大会的七十二个国家代表们都称颂苏联和斯大林，都愿在苏联领导下，团结一致，共同奋斗。”在大会上讲话的还有代表团团员许德珩、郑振铎、丁玲、陈家康。
