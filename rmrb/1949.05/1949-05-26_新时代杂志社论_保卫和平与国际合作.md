New Era Magazine Editorial
Defend Peace and International Cooperation

　　War-mongers overestimate their own strength and especially underestimate the strength of the people who are fully determined to defend peace.

　　Despite the many obstacles erected by the "Western democracies" to prevent the people from expressing their will, the movement to protest the North Atlantic Treaty has developed to a very large scale in all the countries that have joined it. Since the infamous anti-communist pacts of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo, no similar document has aroused such anger among the masses of all countries as the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　The initiators of the North Atlantic Treaty speak of peaceful intentions, using charming words to say that the treaty is defensive in nature, and spread slanderous rumors about the threat of "Soviet aggression" in an attempt to deceive the people. Now it is becoming increasingly clear that these calculations are wrong. Empty talk and hypocritical slander cannot achieve their purpose. Hundreds of millions of people around the world understand that the North Atlantic Treaty and the entire policy it represents are aimed at dividing the world, establishing blocs of nations, confronting the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and blatantly violating the major provisions of the United Nations Charter. It thoroughly undermines the main prerequisite for lasting peace—cooperation among the great powers.

　　The Soviet Union has consistently demonstrated its unwavering desire for international cooperation for the benefit of peace. The policies of the rulers of Western countries are different. They have abandoned the principle of international cooperation, causing alarm and unease, and making international relations tense. This situation is extremely beneficial to arms manufacturers and related monopoly capital, but it is increasingly undermining the economic basis for the survival of the working masses in capitalist countries. The US and Britain's policy of undermining international cooperation has led to the notorious so-called Cold War, deliberately destroying economic ties between Western Europe and the eastern part of the continent—which has caused enormous damage to Western European countries—and openly preparing for a new war, which has been firmly resisted by the people of all countries.

　　Comrade Stalin said a few months ago: "The war instigators who are trying to launch a new war are most afraid of reaching an agreement and cooperation with the Soviet Union, because a policy of harmony with the Soviet Union is detrimental to the position of the war instigators and completely frustrates the aggressive policies of those gentlemen."

　　The entire course of development in the years after the war proves that the Western countries' departure from the sound principle of cooperation with the Soviet Union and their adoption of a rash policy of isolating the Soviet Union has not benefited those who pursue this policy in the first place. The interests of all countries and all peoples dictate that a sincere policy of international cooperation must be restored. Western countries still have a way to return to international cooperation, because the Soviet Union has always supported any serious steps in this direction. This has been proven by the agreement on the Berlin issue reached in the New York talks initiated by the United States.

　　A very broad cross-section of the public warmly welcomes any steps to ease international tensions, and they regard the Four-Power Agreement as an event of great significance, which opens the way for resolving problems on a larger scale through agreement. Now, it has once again been confirmed that only the small group of war-mongers who are detached from the masses and isolated like to make international relations tense. The Soviet public has always clearly distinguished and still clearly distinguishes the small groups of war-mongers in Western countries from the people, whose dedication to the cause of peace is beyond doubt.

　　The road to restoring cooperation among the great powers is open, and what is needed is sincerity and determination to work for international peace and security. As for the German issue—the Berlin issue is an integral part of it—to obtain any satisfactory solution, the Yalta and Potsdam agreements must be observed. Only by resolutely adhering to the principles of Yalta and Potsdam can the German issue be resolved in a way that meets the interests of the Four Powers and the interests of the German people. The extremely miserable situation in the Western occupied areas of Germany, which even the military authorities in the area cannot deny, vividly shows what quagmire awaits those who abandon the Potsdam decisions.

　　The Soviet Union firmly believes that the Berlin issue and the entire German issue can only be resolved through four-nation negotiations, and by the Council of Foreign Ministers established for this purpose by the Potsdam Conference to discuss and seek unanimous agreement on a decision. The reconvening of the Council of Foreign Ministers proves that attempts to resolve the German issue by holding separate meetings and bargaining individually cannot have good results. It is thus clear that the method of issuing orders that no longer works and the attempt to impose one's own will on others that is so favored by the enemies of international cooperation must be abandoned forever from now on.

    新时代杂志社论
    保卫和平与国际合作
    战争贩子过高估计了他们的力量，尤其是过低估计了有充分决心保卫和平的人民的力量。
    尽管“西方民主国家”多方阻挠人民表示他们的意志，但是，抗议北大西洋公约的运动，仍然在所有参加北大西洋公约的国家发展到非常广大的规模。自从希特勒、墨索里尼及东条的臭名远扬的反共公约以来，没有其他同类的文件，象北大西洋公约这样激起过一切国家的群众如此的愤怒。
    北大西洋公约的发起人谈论和平意图，以迷人的语句说公约的目的是防御性的，并且散布关于“苏联侵略”威胁的诽谤性谰言，打算用这来欺骗人民。现在，已经愈来愈明显，这些算盘是打错了。胡说八道和虚伪的诽谤，都不能达到他们的目的。全世界亿万的人民大众了解，北大西洋公约及其所代表的整个政策，是分裂世界，建立国家集团，与苏联及人民民主国家分阵对垒以及公开违反联合国宪章的重大规定，它彻底破坏持久和平的主要前提--大国合作。
    苏联始终一贯地表现了它对于国际合作从而有利和平的坚定不移的愿望。西方国家统治者的政策与此不同。他们放弃了国际合作的原则，引起了惊恐和不安，使国际关系趋于紧张。这种情形对军火制造商以及与之有关的独占资本极为有利，但是，却愈来愈破坏资本主义国家劳动群众生存的经济基础。美英破坏国际合作的政策，招致了出名的所谓冷战，蓄意破坏西欧与大陆东部之间的经济联系--这为西欧国家造成了巨大的损害--并公开准备新战争，这遭到各国人民的坚决反抗。
    斯大林同志数月之前说过：“正在力图发动一次新战争的战争鼓动者，他们所害怕的首先就是与苏联达成协议与合作，因为与苏联和谐一致的政策有损于战争鼓动者的地位，使那些绅士们的侵略政策完全落空。”
    战后几年来整个的发展过程证明，西方国家背离对苏合作的健全原则，采取轻率的孤立苏联政策，其结果首先是对奉行这种政策的人没有好处。一切国家和一切人民的利益，决定了非恢复真诚的国际合作政策不可。西方国家现在仍然有回到国际合作的路可走，因为苏联始终支持在这个方向上的任何认真的步骤。这一点，已由美国所发起的纽约会谈所得出的关于柏林问题的协议得到证明。
    非常广泛的各界公众，热烈地欢迎任何缓和国际紧张局势的步骤，他们认为四国协议是具有重大意义的事件，它打开了在更大范围内用协议解决问题的道路。现在，又一次地证实，只有那些脱离群众而孤立的小批战争贩子，才喜欢使国际关系紧张起来。苏联公众历来明确地区分并且仍然明确地区分西方国家的一些小集团、战争贩子和人民，这些国家的人民之专心致意于和平事业是无可怀疑的。
    恢复大国间合作的道路是畅通的，需要的只是为国际和平及安全而努力的诚意和决心，至于德国问题--柏林问题是它不可分的一部分--要得到任何满意的解决，必须遵守雅尔塔及波茨坦协定。只有坚决遵守雅尔塔及波茨坦的原则，德国问题才能获得既符合四大国利益又符合德国人民利益的解决。和德境西占区极端悲惨的情形，即该区之军事当局也不能不承认，它们生动地表明，等待着那些放弃波茨坦决定的人们的是什么样的泥坑。
    苏联坚定不移地认为，柏林问题和整个德国问题，只有用四国谈判的方法，由波茨坦会议为此目的而设立的外长会议讨论和觅取一致协议的决定，才能得到解决。外长会议的再次召开，证明想单独另行开会、讨价还价来解决德国问题的企图，不能有好结果。由此可见，已经不行时的下命令的方法以及国际合作的敌人所如此喜好的拿自己的意志强加于别人的企图，必须从此永远抛弃。
