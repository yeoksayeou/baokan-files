　　Ping Municipality Education and Research Association
  　Announces Founding Declaration
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Higher Education Institutions Professors and Researchers Union, representing fifteen universities and research institutes in Ping Municipality, was established on the 22nd of this month. The union has now issued its founding declaration, the original text of which is as follows:
    Due to the great victory of the People's Liberation Army and the liberation of Beiping, the professors and researchers of our universities and colleges have also been liberated from the shackles of tyranny. We now have the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, and the freedom of lecturing and research. In order to strengthen our connections, unite, seek common welfare, study academic matters, and promote the new democratic culture, thereby combining academic culture with production and serving the construction of a new China, we hereby formally announce the establishment of the Beijing Higher Education Institutions Professors and Researchers Union (hereinafter referred to as the Education and Research Association).
    We believe that New Democracy is the supreme principle of the new China. In the past, we have waged relentless struggles against feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the future, we should continue our efforts. First of all, it is necessary to widely launch a study movement, apply new viewpoints and new methods to discuss and study together. Secondly, the main tasks of universities and research institutes are to adapt to the needs of the people, cooperate with the government, devote ourselves to the improvement and popularization of science, devote ourselves to teaching and research that is conducive to increasing production, ideological, theoretical, and artistic construction, and cultivate talents suitable for completing the above tasks.
    We know that the current work is arduous and difficult, and we must have our own organization to seek division of labor, cooperation, and connection, to strengthen learning and review, and to engage in criticism and self-criticism, in order to achieve something.
    At the same time, we ask professors and researchers across the country to immediately establish similar organizations in order to further establish a national Education and Research Association. We firmly believe that unity is strength, and under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will surely be able to complete the task of building a national, scientific, and mass-based new culture.
    Hail the new democratic culture!
    Hail the construction of a new China!

　　平市教研联
  　发表成立宣言
    【本报讯】代表平市十五个院校与研究所的北平各院校教授研究员联合会，已于二十二日成立，该会顷发表成立宣言，原文如次：
    由于人民解放军的伟大胜利，由于北平的解放，我们各院校的教授研究员，也从暴政桎梏之下被解放了。有了集会的自由，也有了结社的自由和讲学研究的自由。为了更坚强地联系起来，团结起来，共谋福利，研究学术，促进新民主主义文化，从而把学术文化和生产结合，为建设新中国服务，我们正式宣告成立北平院校教授研究员联合会（简称教研联）。
    我们认为新民主主义是新中国的最高原理。过去我们曾经和封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义作过无情的斗争。今后，更应该继续努力。首先，必需广泛展开学习运动，应用新的观点，新的方法共同商讨，共同研究。其次，大学和研究院、所的主要任务，是适应人民需要，配合政府，致力于科学的提高和普及工作，致力于有利于增加生产的教学和研究，思想的、理论的、艺术的建设工作，以及培养适合于完成上述任务的人才。
    我们知道当前的工作是艰巨的、困难的，必需要有自己的组织，来讲求分工、配合、联系，来加强学习和检讨，从事批评和自我批评，才能有所成就。
    同时，我们要求全国各地的教授研究员们，立刻成立同样组织，以便进一步成立全国性的教研联。我们深信，团结就是力量，在中国共产党的正确领导之下，一定可以完成建立民族的科学的人民大众的新文化的任务。
    为新民主主义文化欢呼！
    为建设新中国而欢呼！
