Research on Several Drought Resistance Techniques
    Cotton Dry Planting Method
    Feng Zhaolin, Agricultural College of Peking University
    Rake the soil finely, the finer the better. Plant the cotton seeds deeper than usual (about three finger-widths deep, or one and a half inches). Do not irrigate; plant seeds in hills, using twice the usual amount of seed per hill. Keep the row and plant spacing the same. Press the soil firmly on top to prevent the wind from blowing away the fine soil and to reduce ventilation. The benefits of this method are: (1) The cotton seeds will not dry out in the soil, nor will they germinate. They will germinate after it rains. (2) The purpose of planting twice as many seeds is that after the rain, when they germinate, there will be many sprouts clustered together. Their upward "pushing" force will be doubled, and even if the soil above is thicker, they will have the strength to emerge. (3) According to the past 20 years of rainfall records in North China, there is usually two to three inches of rain in the Beijing-Tianjin area in early May, and this year is likely to be the same. (4) If you wait until after the rain to sow the seeds, it will be too late, because other crops also need to be sown, and it will be too late to allocate labor. (5) This method is commonly used in cotton-producing areas in Egypt and Central Asia. Some of our farmers also do this. We might as well give it a try.
    Drought-Resistant Planting Method – Trench Planting
    Soil moisture content increases with depth, especially in the uppermost topsoil, where the difference is even greater. Therefore, when planting in dry conditions, planting slightly deeper than usual will provide more moisture. To prevent the seeds from being planted too deep to emerge, we can plant them deeper but cover them with soil as usual (the so-called "deep plowing and shallow covering"), making the planting trench look like a "V" or "U" shape, which can reduce the threat of insufficient moisture affecting germination.
    This year, we compared the ordinary planting method with trench planting. Here are the recent germination results.

    Attached 1948 results:
    5 cm          5 cm            15.2           52.5      84.0
    10 cm         5 cm            16.5           54.0      86.5

    Looking at the above results, we can see that last year, the soil moisture was sufficient, and the ordinary planting method resulted in very good germination. "Trench planting" did not show significant results. However, in this year's drought conditions, ordinary planting cannot germinate, while the condition of trench planting (fourth line, fifth line) is about the same as last year.
    When using the trench planting method, first use a hoe to dig a hole about 15 cm (about five inches) deep, then hill plant, placing five or six seeds in each hill, then cover with soil about one and a half inches, and press lightly. Alternatively, plow deeper with a plow, then plant, covering with a shallow layer of soil, which will also result in seedlings emerging.
    Crop Irrigation Period and Economic Use of Well Water
    1. Irrigation Period. If the irrigation period is not appropriate, the water volume will not have the greatest effect; if the irrigation volume is too large, it will reduce the yield. According to the results of three years of irrigation experiments, the appropriate irrigation period for wheat is November, April, and May, for a total of three irrigations. For millet, it is June (if there is a particularly dry year, a small amount of irrigation must be applied when planting), for a total of one irrigation. For cotton, it is March and June, for a total of two irrigations. The above irrigations should be completed within one day. The appropriate irrigation volume is explained by the number of mu that can be irrigated daily with the appropriate amount of water irrigated by an animal-powered waterwheel. Each well should irrigate two city mu of wheat land per day. With each irrigation period lasting 15 days, each well can control an area of 30 city mu. Each well should irrigate 2.5 city mu of millet land per day. Within 15 days, each well can control an area of 37.5 city mu. In March, each well can irrigate 2.5 city mu of cotton land per day. Within 15 days, each well can control an area of 37.5 city mu. In June, cotton needs less water, and each well can irrigate 5 city mu per day.
    2. Economic Use of Well Water. If wheat is irrigated in November, cotton is irrigated in March, wheat is irrigated in April, wheat is irrigated in May, and millet and cotton are irrigated in June, and the well is located approximately in the center of the farmland, then each well can control 30 city mu of wheat land, 25 city mu of millet land, and 25 city mu of cotton land (irrigating millet for the first 10 days of mid-June, and irrigating cotton for the last 5 days of mid-June). If crops can be planted according to the economic utilization requirements of this well water in a planned way, a larger area can be irrigated with a smaller water source, with one well irrigating 80 city mu.
    Borrowing Strength Planting Method – Cotton Can Be Grown in Places Without Water
    [Reported by this newspaper] Because of this year's spring drought, the masses in Hexi Village, Jingxing Third District, lacked confidence in growing cotton. After Guo, the deputy section chief of the Industry Department, introduced the borrowing strength planting method, everyone's confidence increased. The village chief said, "This will enable us to complete the cotton task." This method can solve the difficulty of carrying water in places far from water. It is introduced below:
    Chop the corn stalks into short sections of one or two inches long, put them in water, and soak them thoroughly. They will retain a certain amount of water. When plowing or digging pits for planting, place the corn stalk sections together with the seeds (two or three sections per pit). This will not only allow seedlings to emerge but also provide fertilizer. (Jingxing Production Small Newspaper)

　　几个防旱技术的研究
    棉花旱播办法
    北京大学农学院  冯兆林
    将土耙细，愈细愈好，将棉籽种下比常年深一点（约三指深合一寸半），不灌水，点种，每穴下种量比常年多一倍，行株矩不变，上面将土压紧以防风将细土吹走，也少透风，这样办法的好处：（一）棉籽在土中不会干枯，也不致发芽，雨水下后即可发芽。（二）下种多一倍的目的，是在下雨之后，发了芽，芽很多，集在一齐，他们向上“顶”的力量就大了一倍，上面土虽厚些，也有力量顶出来。（三）根据华北以往廿年的雨量纪录，平津一带在五月初，总是要下二三寸雨的，今年也可能是这样。（四）若等下了雨之后再下种就太晚了，因为其他庄稼也要下种，人工调配来不及了。（五）这个办法在埃及及中亚细亚国家产棉区是常用的。我们的农民也有的这样做的。我们不妨试一试看。
    防旱播种法——沟播
    土壤的含水量，因深度而递增，特别是最上层表土，相差更大，所以在干旱时播种，若较平常稍为深些，水分也就较多些。因为要防止种的太深出不来，我们可以播得深些，而覆土仍如平常一样，（所谓“深刨浅盖”），使播种沟，象一个“Ｖ”或“Ｕ”字形，可以减轻因水分不足，而影响发芽的威胁。
    今年我们曾将普通播种法和沟播法做了比较，下面是最近发芽的情形。播种深度   覆土厚度    土壤含    　   发芽百分率        备注
　         　　　　　  水量％　　           高粱        玉菱五公分    五公分　     ４．２　         ○　    　○     １．　　２．十公分    五公分       ６．６     １１．０  １２．７    四月　　尚有十公分    十公分       ６．６       ６．６  １０．９    十四　　一部十五公分  五公分     １０．０     ４１．０  ７１．４    、十　　分未十五公分  十公分     １０．０     ３５．０  ７４．２    五日　　出土十五公分  十五公分   １０．０       ３．５  ３２．０    播种附三十七年结果：五公分  　五公分     １５．２     ５２．５  ８４．０十公分    五公分     １６．５     ５４．０  ８６．５
    看上面结果，可以知道去年土壤水分充足，普通播种发芽十分良好，“沟播”也没有明显的成绩，但象今年的干旱情形，普通播种是不能发芽的，而沟播的状况（第四行，第五行）还和去年差不多。
    使用沟播法播种的时候，先用镐头掘穴大约十五公分（五寸左右）深，然后点播，每穴放入种子五、六粒，随即盖土，约一寸五左右，稍行镇压即可，或用犁犁深些，随即播种，覆土浅些，也会出苗。
  　作物灌水期和井水的经济利用
    一、灌水期。如灌水期不甚适宜，则水量不能发生最大的效用；又如灌水量过大，则反使产量减少。据三年来灌溉试验的结果，小麦的适宜灌水期为阳历十一月、四月、五月，计灌水三次，谷子为六月（若遇特别的旱年，须在插种时施以少量的灌水），计灌水一次。棉花为三月和六月，计灌水二次。以上每次灌水是在一日内灌完。适宜的灌水量以畜力水车灌适量的水每日所能灌溉的亩数来说明，每井每日应灌溉小麦地二市亩，每次灌溉期间以十五日计，则每井可支配面积三○市亩；每井每日应灌溉小米地二·五市亩，在十五日内，每井可支配面积三七．五市亩；在三月间，每井每日可灌溉棉花二·五市亩，在十五日内，每井可支配面积三七·五市亩，又在六月间，棉花需水较少，每井每日可灌溉五市亩。
    二、井水的经济利用。若在十一月灌溉小麦，三月灌溉棉花，四月灌溉小麦，五月灌溉小麦，六月灌溉谷子和棉花，且使井之位置约在农地的中央，则每井可支配小麦地三十市亩，谷子地二五市亩，棉花地二五市亩（六月上中旬的十天灌溉谷子，六月中旬的五天灌溉棉花）。如果能够把作物按照这种井水经济利用的要求有计划地播种，就可以用较小之水源灌溉较大的面积，一眼井浇地八十市亩。
  　借力播种法　没水地方也能种棉花
    【本报讯】井陉三区河西村群众，因为今年春旱，大家对种棉花很没信心，经实业科郭副科长介绍借力播种法以后，大家的信心提高。村长说：“这就能完成棉花任务了”。这个办法可以解决离水较远地方担水的困难，今介绍于下：
    把玉茭秸铡成一二寸长的短节，放在水里，充分泡湿，它就保有一定的水量，在犁沟或挖坑播种时，将玉茭节同种籽一同点上（每坑两三节即行），这样既能出苗，也能顶肥料。（井陉生产小报）
