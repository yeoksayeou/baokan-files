    Organize Farmers to Sow While Moist
    Ji-Lu-Yu Daily Publishes Article Calling For Action
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] Following the welcome spring rain across the region, the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily published a short article entitled "Deeply Lead and Organize the Masses, and Make a Concentrated Effort to Complete Spring Sowing" to call for timely sowing. The article stated: With the spring sowing season already pressing, our leaders at all levels must, with a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people, deeply lead and organize the masses to quickly complete this seasonal sowing task. To successfully complete this task, attention must be paid to the following points: (1) More attention has been paid to increasing the production of industrial raw materials (such as planting peanuts, cotton, and flax), and some achievements have been made; however, the increase in grain production has been widely neglected. In addition, in the leadership of many regions, there is still a style of commandism and simplification, with only general and empty calls made, and no deep leadership of mass production or practical solutions to various production difficulties, causing the production work in some areas to remain in a state of laissez-faire. It is hoped that Party committees at all levels and all cadres will thoroughly change these bad styles, quickly go deep into the countryside, strengthen unified leadership, organize forces to complete spring sowing, and absolutely not allow each to act on their own. (2) Cadres at all levels going to the countryside must deeply and widely publicize our Party's various specific policies on rewarding production, dispel the current "fear" in the masses' minds regarding production, and complete spring cultivation in a planned and organized manner. (3) Resolutely solve the difficulties of the masses in labor, animal power, seeds, agricultural tools, and fertilizers. And pay special attention to mobilizing 50% of the young and middle-aged women to participate in major agricultural labor. (4) Currently, in some areas, especially in the newly recovered areas of Henan, some reactionary superstitious events such as temple fairs have caused social unrest and hindered the masses from concentrating on production. Leaders at all levels must pay sufficient attention to this, strengthen the people's armed forces and public security work, and expose rumors in a timely manner to stabilize social order and protect production. (5) Vigorously lead the masses to eliminate wasteland, organize labor and animal exchange, and use human-pulled plows and digging methods to eliminate wasteland.

    组织农民趁湿播种
    冀鲁豫日报著论号召
    【冀鲁豫电】全区喜降春雨，冀鲁豫日报特以“深入领导组织群众，突击完成春季播种”为题，发表短论号召及时播种。该文称：目前春季播种时节已很紧迫，我各级领导同志必须以高度为人民服务的热情，深入领导与组织群众，迅速的完成这一带有季节性的播种任务。为胜利完成这一任务，必须注意以下几点：（１）对增产工业原料（种花生、棉、大麻子等）比较注意，并已收到了某些成绩；但对粮食增产却比较普遍的忽视；另外在不少地区的领导上仍存在着强迫命令简单化的作风，只作一般化的空洞号召，并未深入领导群众生产，切实解决生产的各种困难，致使某些地区的生产工作仍陷于自流状态。希望各级党委以及全体干部彻底转变这些不良作风，迅速深入农村，加强统一领导，组织力量完成春耕播种，绝不允许发生各自为政。（２）各级干部下乡必须深入广泛的宣传我党关于奖励生产的各项具体政策，解除目前群众在生产中的“怕”的思想顾虑，有计划有组织的完成春季耕种。（３）切实解决群众劳力、畜力、种子、农具、肥料等困难。并特别注意发动百分之五十的青壮年妇女参加农业主要劳动。（４）目前各地特别是河南新收复区，有些因闹会门等反动迷信事件，造成社会秩序不安，妨碍了群众安心生产，各级领导同志对此必须引起足够注意，加强人民武装与公安工作，及时揭破谣言，以安定社会秩序，保卫生产。（５）大力领导群众消灭荒地，组织劳畜换工，人拉犁、刨地等办法灭荒。
