　　Pipe Waterwheel:
  　Is a Steel Frame Better!
    Zhang Zhenhua of the Chahar Province Water Conservancy Cooperative answers Liu Yi
    On May 11th, the People's Daily "Work Research" column published Comrade Liu Yi's inquiry about whether the pipe waterwheel absolutely had to be changed from a wooden frame to a steel frame. In order to develop water conservancy, this kind of research spirit is very good. After repeated research and discussion by our cooperative and Zhang Zhenhua (the technician who invented the pipe waterwheel and later converted it to a steel frame, and is now working at the factory), there are some disagreements with Comrade Liu Yi's opinions. The reasons are explained as follows:
    First of all, the steel frame does not weigh 350 jin. After deducting the 240 jin of the same size iron wheels used for both wooden and steel frames, a finished product of two cast iron frames weighs 60 jin. Four jin of iron equals one jin of rice (including one labor unit), totaling 27 jin of rice. But how about a wooden frame? It requires four large wooden frames of four inches square, each costing eight jin of rice, totaling 32 jin. Adding five carpenters (at twelve jin per worker, totaling 60 jin) amounts to 92 jin, excluding paint. Comparing the two, there is a difference of 65 jin, which means that buying one wooden frame can buy more than three steel frames. As for which is lighter? The four wooden frames weigh 80 jin, and the steel frame weighs 60 jin; it is 20 jin lighter than the wooden frame!
    Why was the wooden frame changed to a steel frame? Mainly because it accepted the demands of the masses. Because wooden frames are not durable and are prone to movement, based on this, Zhang Zhenhua painstakingly researched and vigorously improved it in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and only succeeded after a long period of time. Farmers immediately replaced the old wooden frames with steel frames. As for the farmers welcoming the pipe waterwheel at the beginning, it was indeed genuine, but it was not simply welcoming the wooden frame. The wooden frame was certainly not as cheap and lightweight as Comrade Liu Yi suggested. On the contrary, our factory currently produces five steel frames a day, and the demand truly exceeds the supply during this period. The above is specially presented in the hope that knowledgeable comrades will further research this.

### 管子水车　还是铁架好！

　　管子水车
  　还是铁架好！
    察省水利社张振华答刘一
    五月十一日人民日报工作研究栏内刊登刘一同志提供管子水车是否非得由木架改成铁架一事，为了发展水利，这种研究精神是很好的。经本社与张振华（系发明管子车又改造成铁架的技术人现在该厂工作）研究商讨再三，与刘一同志所提意见有不相符合之处，谨将道理分述如下：
    首先铁架没有三百五十斤重，除去木架与铁架用的相同的大小铁轮二百四十斤外，按两扇一个生铁架的成品计算，重六十斤。四斤铁一斤米（用工一个在内）共合米二十七斤。可是一个木架呢？得多用四寸见方大木框四根，每根八斤米，合三十二斤。加木工五个（十二斤一个工合六十斤）共九十二斤，油漆在外。两相比价，差六十五斤，亦即买一个木架可买三个铁架还多。至于那个轻便？木架四根重八十斤，铁架六十斤；比木架还轻二十斤哩！
    为何把木架改成铁架呢？主要是接受了群众要求。因木架不耐久，又活动，据此：张振华在民国二十年又苦心钻研，大力改进，经长时日才得成功。农民随即把过去木架改换成铁架。至于农民在创始时欢迎管子水车，的确真情，然并非单纯欢迎木架，木架更不是如刘一同志所提价廉、轻便。相反，现本厂铁架日出五架，这一时期真是供不应求。特提出如上，希懂行的同志们再加研究。
