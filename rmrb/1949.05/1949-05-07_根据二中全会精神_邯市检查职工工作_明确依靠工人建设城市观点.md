    [This newspaper dispatch] To implement the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, 450 cadres in Handan City systematically studied the reports in the Party newspaper concerning the Second Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and other documents, beginning on April 4th, concluding on the 11th. All the cadres further clarified the viewpoint of relying on the working class to build the city and made specific measures for the whole Party to carry out employee work and restore and develop industrial production. During the study, it was found that there was a vague understanding of which aspects of developing industry and commerce should be developed and who to rely on to develop them. It was thought that any time merchants made more money, it would be beneficial to production; therefore, the struggle against speculators undermining production was relaxed. When understanding the situation in stores and factories, they mostly circled around managers and factory owners, rarely considering approaching workers and shop assistants; therefore, when collecting commercial taxes, they lacked the help and supervision of workers and shop assistants and were deceived by capitalists. The cadres of the Youth League and Women's Federation realized that they previously thought that there were not many workers in Handan City, and the poor were the broad mass base of the city. They narrowly believed that worker work was the business of the trade union, so they did not do worker work themselves. Other departments, such as the municipal government and the People's Education Center, have also neglected protecting the legitimate interests of workers, which has affected the development of worker work and deprived the guarantee for restoring and developing production. Then, according to the spirit of the Second Plenary Session, new decisions were made to strengthen employee work: first, in conjunction with the May production movement, vigorously build the Party among workers, and establish a Party cell in every factory. Regarding employee education, cadres are assigned to be teachers, and lectures must be prepared. Regarding employee welfare, consumer cooperatives of flour companies and printing factories and employee consumer cooperatives supported by the Handan City Cooperative Federation should continue to improve their business to meet the needs of workers. Regarding the democratic rights of employees, the municipal government has formulated a plan to convene worker symposiums to solicit opinions on municipal construction and protecting the economic, political, and democratic rights of employees. In addition to the above gains, this study also revealed that many important issues, such as democratic management in state-owned and public enterprises and labor-capital relations in private enterprises, are not clear enough. For example, some comrades asked: "It is wrong not to rely on the working class, but how to rely on them in the future?" "If workers have democratic management, what do we need managers for?" And how to correctly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, so as to improve the lives of employees while developing production, needs to be resolved through in-depth study.

    根据二中全会精神
    邯市检查职工工作
    明确依靠工人建设城市观点
    【本报讯】邯郸市四百五十余干部，四月四日起开始系统地学习党报关于中共中央二中全会的报导等文件，十一日告一段落。全体干部进一步明确了依靠工人阶级建设城市的观点，并作出全党开展职工工作，恢复发展工业生产的各项具体措施。学习中检查出对发展工商业中，那些该发展，依靠谁才能发展等问题认识模糊，以为凡是商人多赚钱就是对生产有利，故对投机商破坏生产放松了斗争。到商店、工厂了解情况，多在经理厂主中打圈子，很少考虑接近工人、店员，故在征收商业税时缺乏工人、店员帮助监督而受到资方蒙蔽。青、妇会的干部检查出，以前认为邯郸市工人不多，贫民是本城广大群众基础，狭隘的认为工人工作是职工会的事，因而自己便不做职工工作。其他如市府，民教馆一向也都忽视保护工人正当利益等，因而影响工人工作的开展，使恢复发展生产失掉保障。然后，根据二中全会精神，对于加强职工工作，作了新的决定：首先结合五月生产运动，在工人中大力建党，每一工厂中均须建立党的小组。关于职工教育问题，指定干部做教员，讲课要有准备。在职工福利方面，面粉公司、印刷厂的消费合作社及邯市合作总社扶植下的职工消费合作社，应继续改进业务，以满足工人的要求。关于职工民主权利，市府已制订计划，准备召开工人座谈会，征求对市政建设及保障职工经济政治民主权利等意见。此次学习除取得以上收获外，尚有许多重要问题，如国营公营企业中的民主管理，私营企业中的劳资关系等，不够明确，如有的同志提出：“不依靠工人阶级不对，但今后如何依靠？”“要工人民主管理，还要经理做什么？”以及如何正确实行劳资两利方针，使在发展生产中改善职工生活等问题，有待从深入学习求得解决。
