Zambrowski said in his congratulatory message: "The growing cooperation between the People's Poland and the People's Czechoslovakia is based on the principles of internationalism. The fact that Bierut and Gottwald are both presidents and party chairmen in our two countries demonstrates the growing role of the working class, which will further develop our international ties. The growing cooperation between our sister countries will accelerate our two countries towards socialism."
