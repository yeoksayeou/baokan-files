    Instructions from the Health Department of the North China People's Government
    Strengthening Mass Health Work

    [North China News] The Health Department of the North China People's Government, in order to strengthen mass health work and prevent the spread of disease, has issued important instructions to the health departments of various provinces and administrative offices and public hospitals, stating: Since this spring, diseases in many areas of North China, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and typhoid fever, have occurred one after another, and are still occurring in some places. It is estimated that dysentery, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other diseases will continue to occur this summer and autumn. The instructions specifically pointed out: The cholera in central Hebei, the malaria in Taihang, and the smallpox in Chahar North are likely to recur. The instructions stipulate: (1) Governments above the special commissioner's office and city level, and county governments with possible conditions (with county hospitals), should instruct their respective health agencies and public hospitals to send a number of medical personnel to organize mobile epidemic prevention and treatment teams. These teams should include doctors, midwives, and nurses, and their numbers should not be too large, to go to various places for epidemic prevention and treatment. (2) Mobile medical teams should carry out epidemic prevention injections for the masses, provide intensive treatment for urban and rural diseases, and, in the course of treatment, identify infectious or endemic diseases. After on-site research, propose epidemic prevention measures, carry out practical health propaganda and education work, inform the masses of health knowledge, make them consciously prevent epidemics, and thereby break superstitions. When discovering poor environmental and living habits, research should be conducted to propose improvement methods that the masses can accept. Assist local villages and towns in organizing medical cooperative societies and pharmaceutical research associations, unite local doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, and jointly undertake epidemic prevention tasks. (3) Mobile work should be carried out through governments at all levels, in conjunction with local doctors' associations and the masses. (4) All medicines and materials are basically charged (except for smallpox vaccine). If those who are truly poor and have difficulty paying for medicine, free or reduced fees may be given based on the actual situation (priority should be given to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers). This can be paid from the reduced and exempted medical expenses allocated to various regions.
