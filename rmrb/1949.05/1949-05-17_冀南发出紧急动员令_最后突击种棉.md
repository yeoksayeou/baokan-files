(Jinan Telegram) With the cotton planting season rapidly closing, the District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region have jointly issued an urgent mobilization order for rushing to plant and replant, calling on all Party members, government officials, military personnel, and civilians throughout the district to immediately mobilize for a final push to plant cotton. 1. Party, government, and military organs at all levels must vigorously dispatch cadres to rural areas to promote mass planting and replanting. During this critical week, all department cadres, except those required to maintain essential operations, will participate. 2. Party committees, sub-districts, and governments at all levels must assign all teachers and students from elementary schools and above, cadre training classes, and cadres and soldiers from local garrisons and public security teams to rural areas. 3. District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region directly affiliated organs and units will dispatch a large number of cadres to form work teams, specifically dividing areas of responsibility. Each work team must arrive in its designated area by the 13th. 4. Leaders at all levels and work teams should adopt a combat posture in this final push. In their work, they should conduct thorough mobilization, persuade and organize the masses, help solve specific difficulties in planting, and strictly prevent simplistic, careless, and coercive styles of work. 5. Each special district should report its progress to its directly superior office every two days.
