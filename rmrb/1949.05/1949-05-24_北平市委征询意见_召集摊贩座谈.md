【Peiping News】To rationally organize Peiping's street vendors, normally develop industry and commerce, and maintain traffic order, the Peiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially invited 115 representatives of street vendors from various districts to a forum last night (May 23rd) at 8:00 PM to seek their opinions.

Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, pointed out that the principle of reorganizing street vendors is to ensure both the legitimate business of everyone and that traffic and municipal order are not hindered.

Comrade Ye Jianying, Director of the Peiping Military Control Commission and Mayor of the city, elaborated on the policy and methods for managing street vendors: (1) Recognize street vending as legitimate business, formally register them, issue licenses, and collect a portion of taxes. (2) To maintain traffic order, adopt two methods: relocating to other sites and reorganizing in place. (3) Occupation of public land requires application for registration with the government.

In their speeches, the street vendor representatives all expressed their willingness to implement the measures formulated by the government and to inform other street vendors of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government's guidelines and methods for reorganizing street vendors, so as to immediately begin the reorganization work in an organized and planned manner.
