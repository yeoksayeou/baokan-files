　　The Power of the German People
　　The upcoming four-power foreign ministers' conference has kept the ruling classes of the United States, Britain, and France extremely busy. Before formally negotiating with the Soviet Union on the German question, they first made arrangements, including "approving" the puppet constitution. The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France have also been meeting for days, fearing that they would reveal their true colors temporarily. This painstaking effort is quite exhausting! However, the results of the election of the Third German People's Congress gave the United States, Britain, and France a powerful response: what the German people want is a unified country, a fair peace treaty, and the withdrawal of the occupying forces! There is no other way. The unified will of the millions of voters in East Germany shattered the arrogant delusions of the British and American imperialists.
