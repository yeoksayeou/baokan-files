Franco—this lackey of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo—has, for the past three years since the war, become the "darling" of American imperialism. At United Nations meetings, American representatives have repeatedly tried to exonerate Franco of his "crimes," while at the same time lending large sums of money to Franco for use in suppressing domestic people's guerrillas, openly and secretly exhausting all methods to prop up Franco as a "vanguard" against the Soviet Union and the people. No wonder the Nazi female broadcaster, on trial before the judges of American imperialism, became bold and actually silenced these "imperialist justice-seekers" with the following words: "What qualifications do you have to interrogate me? Is it just because I was born a few years earlier than you?"

    佛朗哥，你这个坏东西！
    佛朗哥——这个希特勒、墨索里尼、东条的走卒——战后三年来又成了美帝的“宠儿”，在联合国会议上美国的代表们不止一次的为佛朗哥开脱“罪状”，同时又借大批的钱给佛朗哥用作镇压国内人民游击队的花费，公开的秘密的用尽方法想把佛朗哥扶植成一个反苏反人民的“先锋”，怪不得在美帝的审判官面前受审的纳粹女广播员也大胆了，竟拿下面的话把这些“帝国主义的司法者”质问得哑口无言：“你有什么资格审问我？难道因为我比你早生几年吗？”
