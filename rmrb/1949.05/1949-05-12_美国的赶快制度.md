    The American Speed-Up System

    To intensify the exploitation of workers' blood and sweat and extract more surplus value, American capitalists implemented the so-called scientific management of industry after World War I, with the speed-up system as its core.

    The speed-up system involves employers hiring experts to increase the speed of work significantly by adding special devices to machines and making factory layouts more compact, according to a planned method. Besides using conveyor belts to transport raw materials and more compact linkage machines, "speed-up" methods also include piece-rate wages or other means. Getting paid according to how many pieces you make seems fair, but under capitalism, it becomes a vicious tool for capitalists to force workers to increase labor intensity, extend working hours, and create more wealth for the capitalists. In reality, as soon as the capitalist discovers that a worker's income from piece-rate wages is slightly higher than before, he lowers the piece-rate wage standard, forcing you to "speed up" even more desperately to maintain your income. Therefore, the more you speed up and the more effort you put in, the more you are exploited, and the more the capitalist earns, the more satisfied he becomes. However, where belts and conveyors are widely used, even this piece-rate wage method is unnecessary because these machines operate rapidly and continuously, automatically forcing workers to complete a certain number of pieces at high speed; otherwise, they will be fired and become unemployed.

    As a result of the implementation of the speed-up system, the productivity of each worker has greatly increased. For example, the productivity of American workers in 1927 increased by 50% compared to 1919. This situation is most typical in the automobile and steel industries. According to the book "Labor and Automobiles," in 1920, the Ford Motor Factory could produce 20,000 cars per week. By 1925, with the same machines and the same amount of time, it could produce 31,200 cars. Workers who have worked in that factory are unwillingly hired by other factories because after such intense pressure, people are exhausted and unable to handle any heavy work. Today, the Ford Motor Factory and other factories are implementing the speed-up system even more drastically than before, and therefore the harm to workers is even greater.

    Since the implementation of the speed-up system, the intensity of workers' labor has increased, lives are shorter, dangers are greater, unemployment has increased, wages are lower, and living standards have decreased. According to statistics, the number of American workers who die between the ages of 45 and 55 is one and a half times higher than the average. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Tobin admitted that an industrial accident occurs in the United States every 16 seconds, and a tragedy resulting in death or permanent disability occurs every four minutes. Truman also had to say that there are 2 million cases of worker injuries and deaths in the United States every year. The speed-up system creates so-called "technological unemployment." In 1925, the Ford Motor Factory combined three belts into one, so it only took six people to make twelve cylinders, which originally required nine people. That is to say, three out of every nine people became unemployed. This year, this kind of "technological unemployment" is very serious in the American textile industry. Although the current productivity of American workers has increased by 35% compared to before the war, wages have decreased from 65% of the national income in 1939 to 60% in 1948. Tobin said that 16 million American workers currently have incomes that are 9% lower than the minimum living standard. That is to say, including their families, about 50 million American workers and their families do not have a basic living standard.

    Capitalists in various countries originally wanted to use the speed-up system to strengthen the exploitation of workers in order to save their decline. However, due to the implementation of this system, workers' wages have been reduced, and unemployment has increased, which has reduced the purchasing power of basic consumers and accelerated and deepened the economic crisis. This is really a helpless thing for capitalists. On the other hand, after being squeezed by the speed-up system, workers have increasingly recognized the hideous faces of capitalists in the painful experience of real life, and have improved their class consciousness and strengthened their determination to overthrow the capitalist system. The fact that American workers abandoned the reactionary leaders of the union and resolutely went on strike to oppose the speed-up system is a concrete manifestation of this.

### 美国的赶快制度

    美国的赶快制度
    美国资本家为了加强对工人血汗的榨取；剥削更多的剩余价值，在第一次大战以后，实行所谓工业合理化管理法，而其核心则为最快制度。
    所谓赶快制度，就是由雇主聘用专家，依照所计划的方法，在机器上增加种种特殊的装置，在工厂的布置上增添种种紧凑的安排，使工人的工作速度大大增加，赶快的方法，除了利用传送机运送原料的设备，以及更紧凑的联动机等工具外，也有利用计件工资或其他方法，使工人“赶快”的。做多少件，得多少工资，似乎很公平的，但在资本主义制度下，却成为资本家强制工人提高劳动强度，延长工作时间，替资本家制造更多财富的凶恶手段。实际上资本家一发现工人由计件工资所得的工资比从前多了一点，他便把件工的工资标准减低，你要维持收入，便不得不更加拼命地“赶快”。因此，你越赶快，越出力，就被剥削得越多，而资本家就越赚钱，越得其所哉。但在轮带和传送机普遍引用的地方，连这种计件工资办法也无须利用了，因为这些机器迅速地运转不息，就自动强迫工人按照高速度完成一定的件工，否则便遭解雇，失业。
    由于赶快制实施的结果，每个工人的生产量大大增加，例如美国工人一九二七年的生产量就比一九一九年增加了百分之五十。这种情形在汽车和制钢工业中最为典型。据“劳工与汽车”一书所载，一九二○年福特汽车工厂每星期可造二万辆汽车，到了一九二五年，同样的机器，同样的时间，却可造三万一千二百辆。凡是在该厂做过工的工人，别的厂都不愿招用了，因为经过这种强度的压榨以后，人已有气无力，再也不能担当任何繁重工作了。今天，福特汽车工厂和其他工厂，对于赶快制度的实施，比以前更变本加厉，因此对于工人的危害也就更大了。
    自从赶快制度实施以后，工人的劳动强度更加增长，生命更短，危险更多，失业更增，工资更少，生活水平更加降低。据统计，美国工人死在四十五岁到五十五岁的，要比普通人多一倍半。美国商务部部长托宾承认：美国每十六秒钟发生一次工业上意外事件，每四分钟发生一次致死或造成终身残废的惨剧。杜鲁门也不得不说：每年美国工人发生伤亡事件二百万宗。赶快制度造成所谓“技术失业”，一九二五年福特汽车工厂把三条皮带拼成一条，结果原需九人才能造成十二个汽缸，现在则只要六个人就够了。就是说，每九个人中就有三个人因而失业。今年，美国纺织业中这种“技术失业”的情形已很严重。美国工人现时生产量虽较战前增加了百分之三十五，但工资反而从一九三九年占国民总收入的百分之六十五，下降到一九四八年的百分之六十了。托宾说：美国现有一千六百万工人的收入比最低生活水平还低百分之九。那就是说，加上他们的家庭，约有五千万美国工人及其家属没有起码的生活水平。
    各国资本家原想利用赶快制度，加强剥削工人，以挽救他们的没落。但由于实施了这种制度，工人工资减低，失业增加，反而缩小了基本消费者的购买力，加速和加深经济危机。这实在是资本家无可奈何的事情。而另一方面，工人经过赶快制度的压榨，在痛苦的实生活的体验中，一天天更加认识了资本家的狰狞面目，而提高了自己的阶级觉悟，加倍地增强推翻资本制度的决心。这次美国工人为反对赶快制度，抛弃工会的反动首领，而坚决举行罢工，便是一个具体表现。
