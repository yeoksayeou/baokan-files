[Tianjin Dispatch] The workers of Tianjin Paper Industry Company's No. 1 and No. 2 factories are striving to improve product quality and reduce costs through technical research. In the past, due to equipment limitations, the newsprint produced by the company was only glossy on one side and had many breaks, which affected the printing efficiency of users. The security paper produced was not clean, with reed fibers on the surface, making it prone to sticking to the printing plates. At the same time, high costs affected product sales. To change this situation, in addition to appropriately modifying production plans based on sales, equipment, and raw materials, the company is particularly emphasizing technical improvements.

To improve the issue of breaks in newsprint, the No. 2 factory sent personnel to newspapers and printing factories for field research and convened a technical review meeting for papermaking team workers. The meeting proposed four concrete improvement measures, including not tearing paper samples on the papermaking machine and not adding rosin to the ingredients. It was decided to implement a strict inspection of finished products and a system of individual responsibility. Since then, breaks have been greatly reduced.

The workers of the No. 1 factory also launched a "Contribute Skills and Achieve Success" campaign, actively researching and using 50% waste banknotes, 20% hemp, and 30% waste cotton as raw materials to trial-produce improved security paper. They are also finding ways to install a two-sided calendaring machine to improve the quality of newsprint.

In addition, workers in the No. 1 factory's pulping room and boiler room, in order to save fuel coal, tried mixing one basket of coal with one and a half baskets of reed wool. The result was that the original pressure and temperature could still be maintained, saving 1.5 tons of coal per day. After research, the papermaking team workers added a pulp return pipe to the bottom of the flow box, avoiding the situation where the flow box would be filled with pulp during power outages, resulting in the need to discharge the pulp into the ground, causing significant losses.

### 津纸业职工献技立功　要把一面光纸变成两面都光

　　津纸业职工献技立功
  　要把一面光纸变成两面都光
    【天津电】天津纸业公司所属一、二两厂的职工，正努力钻研技术，以改进产品质量，降低成本。过去该公司所出的新闻纸，由于设备关系，只是一面光的，而且断头甚多，影响用户的印刷效率。所出的证券纸表面不洁净，纸上有苇膜，印刷时容易糊版。同时由于成本太高，影响了产品的销路。为改变此种情形，该公司除依销路、设备，原料等情形，适当修改生产计划外，特别着重技术的改进。二厂为改良新闻纸的断头缺陷，曾派员到报社及印刷厂实地研究，并召开造纸组职工技术检讨会，提出了在造纸机上不扯纸样，配料时不加松香等四项具体改进办法，决定实行严格检查成品及各人负责制度。此后，断头大见减少。第一厂的职工并展开“献技立功”运动，积极研究利用百分之五十的废钞，百分之二十的麻及百分之三十的废棉为原料，试制改进的证券纸。并设法按装两面轧光机，改进新闻纸质量。此外，一厂打浆室，锅炉房等工人为节省燃煤，曾试用一筐煤掺烧一筐半苇毛，结果仍能保持原有气压与温度，每天因而省煤一吨半。造纸组工人经研究后，在流送箱底加装了回浆管，避免了在停电时纸浆冲满流送箱，以致必须放浆流入地里，受到很大损失。
