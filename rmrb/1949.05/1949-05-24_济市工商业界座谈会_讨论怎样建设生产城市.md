Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd—The Jinan Municipal People's Government convened a symposium of industrial and commercial circles of the whole city on the 18th. First, Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, expounded the CPC's policy on developing industrial production. Then, the industrialists and businessmen present offered many opinions on labor-capital relations, raw material procurement, product sales, industrial and commercial administration, and bank loans. Finally, Deputy Mayor Yao Zhongming answered them one by one. He said: The general guideline for the work of a people's city is to transform a consumer city into a production city. Therefore, we should vigorously develop industries that are beneficial to the people's livelihood, while protecting legitimate commerce. Regarding labor-capital disputes, reasonable solutions should be sought through labor-capital agreements based on the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and capital. The government will also establish appropriate institutions to be responsible for handling such issues. Regarding the issue of capital, the government will provide appropriate loans and support to industries that are beneficial to the people's livelihood. However, the best approach is for each factory and enterprise to find ways to absorb a large amount of idle social capital on its own. Regarding the issues of raw material supply and product sales, as the liberated areas continue to expand and transportation becomes smoother in the future, these issues can be gradually resolved as long as private enterprises and state-owned trading companies cooperate well. Regarding industrial and commercial administration, the current government is drafting a trademark law to protect inventions and creations, prevent speculation and counterfeiting, and will soon conduct a general industrial and commercial registration in order to implement scientific management of the market.

　　济市工商业界座谈会
  　讨论怎样建设生产城市
    【新华社济南二十三日电】济南市人民政府于十八日召开全市工商业界座谈会，首由中共济南市委书记刘顺元阐述中共关于发展工业生产的政策，接着各工商业家就劳资关系、原料采购、成品推销、工商行政、银行贷款各方面提供了许多意见，最后由副市长姚仲明一一加以解答。他说：人民城市工作的总方针，是要把消费的城市变成生产的城市。因此，应大力发展对国民生计有益的工业，同时保护正当的商业。关于劳资纠纷，应本劳资两利的原则，经过劳资协议求得合理解决。政府亦将建立适当机构，负责处理这类问题。关于资金问题，政府对于对国民生计有益的工业，当适当贷款扶植。但最好的办法，是各工厂企业自己设法大量吸收社会游资。关于原料供给与成品推销问题，今后解放区日益扩大，交通运输日益畅通，只要各私营企业与国营贸易公司很好合作，是可以逐渐得到解决的。关于工商行政方面，现政府正拟订立商标法，以保护发明和创造，防止投机冒充，并即将举办普遍的工商业登记，以便实行市场的科学管理。
