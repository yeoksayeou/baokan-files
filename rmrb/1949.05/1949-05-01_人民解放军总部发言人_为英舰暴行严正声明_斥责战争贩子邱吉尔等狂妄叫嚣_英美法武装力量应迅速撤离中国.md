Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 30th: General Li Tao, spokesperson for the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, issued a statement today regarding the incident of the British warship HMS Amethyst, stating: We denounce the arrogant statement of warmonger Churchill. On April 26th, Churchill demanded in the British House of Commons that the British government send two aircraft carriers to the Far East to "carry out armed retaliation." Mr. Churchill, what are you "retaliating" against? British warships, along with Kuomintang warships, intruded into the defense zone of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and opened fire on the People's Liberation Army, resulting in the injury and death of more than 252 of our loyal and brave soldiers. The British have committed such a great criminal act within Chinese territory, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army has reason to demand that the British government admit its mistake and carry out an apology and compensation. Is it not these things that you should be doing in the future, rather than mobilizing troops to China to "retaliate" against the Chinese People's Liberation Army?

Prime Minister Attlee's words are also wrong. He said that Britain has the right to send warships into China's Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is China's inland river. What right do you British have to send warships in? There is no such right. The territorial sovereignty of China must be defended by the Chinese people and absolutely no foreign government is allowed to infringe upon it.

Attlee said: The People's Liberation Army is "prepared to allow the British warship HMS Amethyst to sail to Nanjing, but on one condition, that the ship assist the People's Liberation Army in crossing the river." Attlee is lying. The People's Liberation Army has not allowed the HMS Amethyst to sail to Nanjing. The People's Liberation Army does not want any foreign armed forces to help cross the river or do anything else. On the contrary, the People's Liberation Army demands that British, American, and French warships, military aircraft, marines, and other armed forces in the Yangtze River, Huangpu River, and elsewhere in China, swiftly withdraw from China's territorial waters, territorial seas, territory, and airspace, and not help the enemies of the Chinese people fight the civil war.

The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government have not yet established diplomatic relations with any foreign government. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are willing to protect foreign nationals in China engaged in normal business. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with various foreign countries, and this relationship must be based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, independence, and integrity, first and foremost that various foreign countries do not help the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are unwilling to accept any threatening actions from any foreign government. If a foreign government is willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with us, it must sever relations with the Kuomintang remnant forces and withdraw its armed forces in China.

Attlee complained that the Chinese Communist Party was unwilling to deal with the old foreign diplomatic personnel (consuls recognized by the Kuomintang) in the past because it had not established diplomatic relations with foreign countries. This complaint is unreasonable. In the past few years, the governments of the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries have been helping the Kuomintang oppose us. Has Mr. Attlee also forgotten this? What country gave the Kuomintang the Chongqing warship that was sunk not long ago? Does Mr. Attlee not know this?

    为英舰暴行严正声明
    斥责战争贩子邱吉尔等狂妄叫嚣
    英美法武装力量应迅速撤离中国
    【新华社北平三十日电】中国人民解放军总部发言人李涛将军本日为英国军舰紫石英号事件，发表声明称：我们斥责战争贩子邱吉尔的狂妄声明。四月二十六日，印吉尔在英国下院，要求英国政府派两艘航空母舰去远东，“实行武力的报复”，邱吉尔先生，你“报复”什么？英国的军舰和国民党的军舰一道，闯入中国人民解放军的防区，并向人民解放军开炮，致使人民解放军的忠勇战士伤亡二百五十二人之多。英国人跑进中国境内做出这样大的犯罪行为，中国人民解放军有理由要求英国政府承认错误，并执行道歉和赔偿。难道你们今后应当做的不是这些，反而是开动军队到中国来向中国人民解放军进行“报复”么？艾德礼首相的话也是错误的，他说英国有权开动军舰进入中国的长江。长江是中国的内河，你们英国人有什么权利将军舰开进来？没有这种权利。中国的领土主权，中国人民必须保卫，绝对不允许外国政府来侵犯。艾德礼说：人民解放军“准备让英舰紫石英号开往南京，但要有一个条件，就是该舰要协助人民解放军渡江”。艾德礼是在撒谎，人民解放军并没有允许紫石英号开往南京。人民解放军不希望任何外国武装力量帮助渡江，或做任何别的什么事情。相反，人民解放军要求英国、美国、法国在长江黄浦江及在中国他处的军舰，军用飞机，陆战队等项武装力量迅速撤离中国的领水，领海，领土，领空，不要帮助中国人民的敌人打内战。中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府直到现在还没有和任何外国政府建立外交关系。中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府愿意保护从事正常业务的在华外国侨民。中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府愿意考虑和各外国建立外交关系，这种关系必须建立在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的独立和完整的基础之上，首先是各外国不能帮助国民党反动派。中国人民革命军事委员会及人民政府不愿意接受任何外国政府所给予的任何带威胁性的行动。外国政府如果愿意考虑和我们建立外交关系，它就必须断绝和国民党残余力量的关系，并将它在中国的武装力量撤回去。艾德礼埋怨中国共产党过去因为和外国没有建立外交关系而不愿意和外国政府的旧外交人员（国民党承认的领事）发生关系，这种埋怨是没有理由的。过去数年内，美国、英国、加拿大等国政府是帮助国民党反对我们的，难道艾德礼先生也忘记了？被击沉不久的重庆号重巡洋舰是什么国家赠给国民党的，艾德礼先生难道也不知道么？
