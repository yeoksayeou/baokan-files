    The eight middle schools and thirty-four municipal primary schools in Taiyuan City were smoothly taken over within three days of liberation. Middle schools are scheduled to officially reopen on April 30th, and preparations for the reopening of primary schools are also actively underway. After the end of the battle, teachers, staff, and students of the city voluntarily reported to the various takeover teams. As of April 27th, statistics showed that 221 teachers and staff (including workers) had reported, accounting for 95% of the total. Of the 1,727 middle school students in the city before liberation, 1,395 have reported. More than 20 impoverished students who dropped out of school due to the exploitation and destitution caused by the Yan [Xishan] bandits have also come to the school to request resumption of their studies. Of the original 98 primary school teachers and staff, 81 have reported. The total number of primary school students in the city is 3,382, and one-third have already reported. All teachers and staff of Taiyuan Middle School and Kenan Middle School voluntarily filled out forms reporting their involvement in reactionary organizations, and requested to read new books and newspapers and study revolutionary theory. The students are also urgently demanding an early resumption of classes.
