    Tangshan Steel Plant Workers
    Increase Production by Saving Materials
    Steel Output Exceeds Plan by 46 Percent
    [Tangshan Telegraph] Workers at the Tangshan Steel Plant victoriously completed their production plan before the "May 1st" Labor Day. Output in April significantly increased. Steel production exceeded the original April plan by 46.25 percent, representing 220 percent of the average monthly output before liberation. Rolling steel output exceeded the April production plan by 51 percent, representing 258 percent of the average output before liberation. Last month, in order to welcome the first "May 1st" Labor Day after liberation, workers in the steelmaking and rolling steel factories launched a wave of production competition. The steelmaking workshop switched to a three-shift system from April, and each shift started production competitions. The charging workers paid attention to adding materials quickly and saving electricity; the furnace bottom builders tightened the furnace bottom to extend its life. Recently, the Lao Baishi group can save more than ten kilograms of coke per furnace. Some workers also participated in technical lectures, studying and learning at work to improve production technology. The workers in charge of firing, shearing, and rollers all intensified their efforts. The workers who watched the motors and managed the warehouses participated in shearing and other work in addition to not delaying their own work, and the leaders sometimes personally took action. On April 23, the shears of the rolling mill broke, and the workers of the electromechanical workshop repaired them overnight, even forgetting to eat. On April 28, the rollers of the rolling mill broke, and electromechanical workers Song Changsheng and Lu Zhongming repaired them in less than two hours, which used to take half a day. After the news of the liberation of Nanjing came, in order to celebrate this great victory and support the front, the workers of each department proposed extra processing without wages. The rolling mill has been rolling about 245 steel bars every day since the 25th (normally only about 170 or 180 steel bars are rolled every day). Significant achievements have also been made in saving raw materials. Coal consumption was saved by 378 kilograms per ton of rolled steel (before liberation, 795 kilograms of coal were used per ton, and 417 kilograms were used per ton in April), and electricity consumption was saved by 78 kilowatt-hours per ton (before liberation, 156 kilowatt-hours were used per ton, and 78 kilowatt-hours were used per ton in April). The factory has now decided to purchase 350,000 yuan worth of goods as prizes to reward the workers who have successfully completed the "May 1st" production plan, and will also carry out a merit evaluation campaign and hold a celebration meeting.

    加工省料提高生产
    炼钢量超过计划百分之四十六
    【唐山电】唐山制钢厂工人胜利完成“五一”劳动节前的生产计划。四月份产量显著提高。炼钢量超过四月份原订计划的百分之四十六点二五。为解放前平均月产量的百分之二百二十。轧钢量超过四月份生产计划百分之五十一，为解放前平均产量的百分之二百五十八。上月该厂工人为迎接解放后第一个“五一”劳动节，炼钢和轧钢工厂工人掀起竞赛生产热潮。炼钢工场从四月份开始改为三班制，各班展开生产竞赛，装料工人注意加料、鉍化快、用电省；筑炉底工人把炉底筑紧，使炉底的寿命延长，最近老白石组每炉可省十多公斤焦炭。还有一部工人参加了技术讲座，在工作中钻研、学习以提高生产技术。烧火、剪断、以及辊子上的工人莫不加紧，看马达的、管理库房工作的工友在不耽搁自己的工作外，参加剪断等工作，各领班的有时也亲自下手。四月二十三日轧钢场的剪刀坏了，机电场工人连夜修理，饭都顾不得吃。二十八日轧钢厂辊子坏了，机电工人宋长生和鲁忠明，不到两个钟点就修理好了，这个工作在以前就得半天的工夫。南京解放的消息传来后，各部工人为了庆祝这一伟大胜利支援前线，纷纷提出额外加工，不要工资。轧钢厂从二十五日起，每天都轧二百四十五条左右。（按平时每天只轧一百七八十条左右）。在节省原料方面也有显著成绩，轧钢每吨节省煤三百七十八公斤（解放前每吨用煤七百九十五公斤，四月每吨用四百一十七公斤），每吨省电七十八度（解放前每吨用电一百五十六度，四月份每吨用电七十八度）。现厂方已决定以三十五万元人民券购买实物作为奖品，奖励胜利完成“五一”生产计划的工人，并将开展评功运动，召开庆功大会。
