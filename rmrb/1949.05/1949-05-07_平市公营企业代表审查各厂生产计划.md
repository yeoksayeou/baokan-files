　　Ping Municipality Public Enterprise Representatives Review Production Plans of Various Factories
    [Reported by this newspaper] In response to the call of the Ping Municipality Party Committee, the public enterprises of Beiping Municipality have successively formulated and printed this year's production plans. The Beiping Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau, in order to review this plan, submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval, and then convened representatives of various public enterprises yesterday (the 6th) to jointly discuss and review it. Those whose review was passed yesterday included the Beiping Pharmaceutical Factory, the Ice Factory, the First Soy Sauce Factory, and the Second Soy Sauce Factory. It is understood that the plan of the Beiping Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory is to trial-produce several medicines on the basis of existing materials, and then manufacture them in large quantities after research by all parties. At the same time, a batch of medicines urgently needed by the rural areas will be manufactured, such as "Quinine," "Aspirin," and medicines needed for children's epidemics. And gradually hire technical talents, expand capital, and add machines, in order to change the phenomenon of only manufacturing semi-finished products and packaging, to achieve self-reliance, and to be completely capable of making medicines by ourselves. The conference is expected to last five days and will continue today. (Shang Wei)
