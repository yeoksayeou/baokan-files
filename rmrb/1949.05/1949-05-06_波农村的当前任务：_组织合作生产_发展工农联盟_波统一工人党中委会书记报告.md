Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw dispatch: Samborski, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, reported on the current tasks in rural areas at the Central Committee meeting of the Party on April 20th. He said: The class struggle in rural areas is very sharp. There are quite a few rich peasants there, and the basis for general capitalist development still exists in small-scale peasant production. When agricultural machinery production develops, the development of cooperative movements, especially production cooperatives organized on a voluntary basis, gradually develops, which is a method of consolidating the prosperity of working peasants. The party's line in rural areas is: in order to lead the countryside towards socialism, we should maximize the development of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class. Samborski pointed out that in recent months, the worker-peasant alliance has become increasingly close in the class struggle to defend small and middle peasants (i.e., poor and middle peasants). Under the current circumstances, the composition of the countryside has changed, and the number of middle peasants has increased. Samborski spoke about the party's tasks in rural areas, saying: The party must expand the achievements already made in the cooperative movement and pay special attention to the connection between cooperatives and the rural population; cooperatives have particularly broad possibilities for processing agricultural products. Various separate agricultural cooperatives must be connected with the Farmers' Mutual Aid Alliance. It is necessary to promote the organization of state-owned machine centers. Every form of production cooperative must be developed. Samborski said: As for the attitude towards rich peasants, if rich peasant elements hand over part of their land to the cooperative for use and become middle peasants, then they can be incorporated into the production cooperative after a few years. However, it should not be imagined that many rich peasants will do this. Turning to the party's tasks in ideological and organizational terms, Samborski said: The most conscious and most active small and medium property owners can be absorbed into the party after in-depth work. The ranks of the Polish Youth League in rural areas must also be expanded. He concluded by saying: By implementing these tasks and resolutely implementing the party's general line—the line of intensifying the struggle against the capitalist exploitation of the peasant masses in the countryside, developing the cooperative movement in many ways, and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance—the party will turn the peasant masses towards socialism.

    波农村的当前任务：
    组织合作生产  发展工农联盟
    波统一工人党中委会书记报告
    【新华社北平四日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记萨姆布劳斯基四月二十日在该党中央委员会上报告在农村中的当前任务。他说：阶级斗争在农村中非常尖锐。那里存在着为数颇多的富农，而一般资本主义的发展基础仍然在农民小商品生产中存在着。当农业机器生产发展的时候，合作社运动的发展，特别是在自愿原则上组成的生产合作社也逐渐发展，便是巩固劳动农民繁荣的方法。党在农村中的路线是：为了领导农村走向社会主义，尽量发展工人阶级起领导作用的工农联盟。萨姆布劳斯基指出，在最近几个月保卫小农（即贫农）中农的阶级斗争中，工农联盟日益紧密。在目前情况下，农村的成份已经改变，中农的数目已经增加。萨姆布劳斯基讲到党在农村中的任务说：党必须扩大在合作社运动中所已达到的成就，特别注意合作社与农村民众的联系；合作社对农业产品进行加工，有特别广泛的可能性。各个分立的农业合作社，必须与农民互助联盟联系。必须提倡组织国有机器中心站。每种形式的生产合作社都必须发展。萨姆布劳斯基说道：至于对富农的态度，要是富农分子把他的一部分土地交给合作社使用而变成中等有产者，那么他在几年后便可被容纳入生产合作社。但是不能臆想许多富农都将这样作。萨姆布劳斯基在转而谈到党在思想与组织方面的任务时说道：最觉悟与最积极的中小有产者可以在深入的工作后吸收入党。波兰青年联盟在农村中的行列也必须扩大。他在结语中说：由于实行这些任务并坚决执行党的总路线——对农村资本家之剥削农民大众进行加紧斗争的路线，多方面发展合作社运动和加强工农联盟的路线，党将使农民群众转向社会主义。
