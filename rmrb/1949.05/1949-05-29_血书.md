    Blood Letter
    Yang Shuo
    In the winter of 1948, as the annihilation of the enemy's ace 35th Army at Xinbaoan neared its end, the remaining enemies were compressed into a large courtyard, like fish in a rapidly drying puddle, crammed into the last muddy pool, frantically splashing, but only in a desperate struggle. Many troops withdrew from the battle to rest temporarily. I encountered a familiar company in front of the collapsed fortifications in the Wengcheng circle. The soldiers were covered in dust and looked quite tired, but some were playing the harmonica and occasionally telling jokes, unable to hide their victorious mood.
    As soon as Instructor Liu saw me, he grabbed my hand, and I immediately gripped his hand, shaking it vigorously. Among comrades, after experiencing important events, the first meeting is often especially warm, without the need for many words, their feelings completely uniting. He pulled me into an air-raid shelter, took a piece of paper from his diary, handed it to me, and said, "Take a look at this comrade, he's really good!"
    The paper was stained with a lot of blood, half-dry, and the writing was vaguely discernible. It read:
    "I request to perform meritorious service on the front lines and join the Party. Even if I die, I request that my application to join the Party be approved."
    The name written below was Yang Erni. I repeated the name several times and it sounded familiar. Instructor Liu reminded me, "Have you forgotten? He used to be a communication soldier in the company headquarters, and you even talked to him."
    Immediately, a young figure leaped into my mind: slender build, with a childish face, and a black mole on the left corner of his lips, making him appear both clever and decisive. That day, when I went to the company headquarters, I saw him leaning against the door frame, his head lowered, his face full of tears.
    Instructor Liu looked at me and smiled, "Look at this comrade, we always hear about family values, but he has unit values. He has scabies and was told to go to the rear for a few days of recuperation, but he didn't want to leave the unit at all."
    Yang Erni mumbled, "I can walk and move, I can do whatever you tell me to do, I just don't want to go to the rear."
    The instructor waved his hand and smiled, "Okay, okay, we agree to your opinion."
    Yang Erni couldn't help but be happy, wiped his tears, jumped into the courtyard, and immediately began to sing. It's not surprising that he has such deep feelings for the unit. He was from Guangling, Shanxi. His father died when he was seven, and his mother was so poor that she had to marry him off and leave him with his aunt. At twelve, he started doing odd jobs for a landlord. If the water vat wasn't full, he'd be beaten, and if the weeding wasn't clean, he'd also be beaten. The landlord's son ate fine white flour noodles, and seeing him hungry, he would spit on a bun, dip it in urine, smear it with manure, and throw it to him, and he would eat it, while the others would take pleasure in this. Growing up to seventeen, who ever touched his head? Who ever asked him if he was cold or hot? He lived like roadside grass, trampled on by others, all the grievances in his heart turning into tears, but he didn't dare to cry, and could only hide behind Yin Mountain to shed them quietly.
    Since joining the Liberation Army, he tasted the warmth of the human world for the first time. The comrades treated him like their own brothers, taking off their clothes to keep him warm when he was cold, and covering him with a quilt when he kicked it off at night. He lived in the comrades' love, and often thought of his past suffering, so the instructor let him talk freely in the company. He talked, and others talked. It turned out that the world was full of suffering people, how could they all come together from different parts of the country and speak as if they were children of the same suffering mother? He became a typical example of complaining about suffering in the company. With this came a feeling of unease, and he suddenly requested a transfer from the instructor.
    Instructor Liu stared at him strangely. He said firmly, "Being a communication soldier in the company headquarters means I can't fight often. I want to go to a squad and personally take up a gun to eliminate the reactionaries who harm the poor!" He requested this repeatedly. Finally, they had to transfer him.
    He became a combat team leader in the squad. Two others in his team were called Zhang Dianying and Little Guangdong, both liberated soldiers. Yang Erni took the lead in everything, marching, training. He was even fiercer and more courageous in battle. But he wasn't without any desires. Everyone has a hope. When he was a farmhand, he longed to sleep enough and eat his fill. Now that he lived as a master, he wanted to live more meaningfully and gloriously. He longed to earn the title of Communist Party member. He had long given his entire life to the revolution, without haggling, but this was his only hope.
    As soon as the enemy in Xinbaoan was surrounded, his combat team made a plan to perform meritorious service. He even secretly wrote an application to join the Party with an "electric pen," and kept it in his close-fitting clothes. Strangely, just this piece of paper gave him endless strength. After the attack was launched, the Liberation Army's artillery fire sounded like flowing water, smashing straight at the city walls, raising clouds of dust that blocked the sky, and nothing could be seen. Taking advantage of the artillery fire, Yang Erni led the combat team to climb up the city first. Then they rushed down the city and compressed the enemy into the streets.
    The enemy was already in disarray, firing blindly and running backward. Many bandit soldiers turned their hat brims to the back of their heads, knelt on one knee, and raised their guns with both hands to surrender. At this time, Yang Erni completely forgot himself, and had no thoughts, only one idea dominated him: if the enemy doesn't surrender, resolutely eliminate them! The 35th Army was truly a great enemy of the people of North China, having seized the people's city of Zhangjiakou, burning, killing, and looting everywhere, causing the people great suffering. Eliminating the enemy was eliminating the people's suffering. As the enemy fled, he chased them relentlessly.
    He came to a crossroads when suddenly a burst of rapid machine gun fire came head-on. Bullets flew wildly. He quickly lay down behind a corner of the wall, and heard Zhang Dianying gasping beside him, "The unit is pinned down by the machine gun, they can't get up!"
    There was a bunker at the crossroads, squatting there like a toad, and the machine gun was firing from the bunker. Yang Erni's group of three charged fiercely, breaking through to the front, but the troops behind were temporarily suppressed by the machine gun, and lost contact with them.
    Zhang Dianying cursed, "A dead ghost wearing flowers, shameless! See how long you can be arrogant!"
    Yang Erni said, "If this nail isn't pulled out, the troops can't advance. The chance to perform meritorious service is now!"
    He beckoned to Zhang Dianying and Little Guangdong, got up to charge, but an enemy shell exploded, knocking him down, the dust blinding him. When the dust settled a little, he saw Little Guangdong blown into a pit, his head split open, blood spurting out. He scrambled over in a hurry, and with Zhang Dianying's help, dragged Little Guangdong to a hidden place, tearing his own shirt to bandage his wound.
    Little Guangdong gasped like a broken thread, and said weakly, "You don't have to worry about me, team leader!... It's useless to worry!"
    Yang Erni hastily bandaged his wound, and said, "Don't worry, you'll be fine after being taken down for a few days of recuperation. We eat from the same pot and sleep on the same kang, not even brothers are so close, if I don't take care of you, who will?" But why was his left arm so sore and weak, and he couldn't use his strength. He looked down and saw that a large piece of his left cotton coat sleeve had been blown to shreds, and three or four pieces of shrapnel had hit his arm, and the blood had soaked the cotton.
    Zhang Dianying said anxiously, "Team leader, you should go down!"
    Yang Erni gritted his teeth and said, "As long as I have a breath, I will fight those sons of bitches to the end!"
    He placed Little Guangdong in a nearby civilian house, bandaged his wound, hooked his finger on the hand grenade's pull ring, nodded to Zhang Dianying, and the two of them ran forward one after the other, looking for an opening. The machine gun in the bunker fired again, and a bullet flew past his scalp, like a gust of wind, swooshing off his hat. He plunged into a shell crater, gasped for a few breaths, and as soon as the enemy's machine gun paused, he suddenly jumped up again, rushing like an arrow to the top of the bunker, and shoved two hand grenades into the gunhole, shouting, "Surrender! Surrender or we'll take your lives!"
    There were screams in the bunker, and guns were thrown out of the gunhole one after another. Zhang Dianying caught up, climbed into the bunker, carried out a light machine gun, and escorted five or six prisoners. At this moment, there was shouting from the front civilian houses, and an enemy company counterattacked. Yang Erni became anxious, grabbed the just captured machine gun, shouted at a prisoner, "You load the bullets for me, our people will be here soon!"
    The prisoner was happy to do so, and immediately helped to fire the machine gun, saying to himself, "Who doesn't want to surrender! It's all the officers forcing us with guns!"
    The counterattacking enemy was also forced by the officers. A clear view could be seen of an officer hiding behind a wall, blindly swinging a pistol and stomping his feet. The enemy counterattacked once, the machine gun fired, and they retreated with a whoosh, and counterattacked again, and retreated with a whoosh. But why was there no sign of Yang Erni's follow-up troops? He felt anxious and fired even more fiercely. The enemy counterattacked for the fifth time, and before they could even fire, they were in chaos. Yang Erni roared, grabbed the machine gun, jumped up, turned the muzzle at the officer, and knocked him down. Suddenly, his chest shook, the machine gun fell from his arms, and he somersaulted down.
    At this moment, he heard a burst of killing sounds in his ear, and the company commander led the follow-up troops up with a whoosh. The enemy was terrified and scrambled to surrender.
    Zhang Dianying rushed to Yang Erni's side, and busily bandaged his wound, but Yang Erni struggled and shouted, "I want to charge!" But he had already been wounded for the second time, hit in the right chest, and lost too much blood, and no longer had the strength.
    Instructor Liu ran up, squatted down and asked, "How is it? How is it? Are you alright?"
    The black mole on Yang Erni's lips moved, and he gasped breathlessly, "Instructor, I failed to completely annihilate the enemy, I'm really sorry to the people!"
    Instructor Liu held his hand and said, "You fought well, you fought too well, you will definitely be commended!"
    But Yang Erni had a more urgent request. He put his hand on his chest, wanting to take something out, but he trembled and couldn't get it out. The instructor understood his meaning, felt around, and took out his application to join the Party from his close-fitting clothes, which was almost half soaked in blood.
    Yang Erni looked at the instructor and asked softly, "Do you think I meet the requirements for joining the Party?"
    Instructor Liu, reading the blood letter, was so moved that his eyes were moist, and he raised his voice and said, "You gave your life for the revolution, is there anything more loyal than that? I represent the Party, and now approve your application to join the Party!"
    When this blood letter was passed into my hands, Yang Erni had already been taken to the hospital with a relieved smile. I love this comrade, and care even more about his life, and couldn't help but ask, "Do you think he'll be alright?"
    Instructor Liu said, "The wound is not light! But that kid fought tenaciously, and his life is also tenacious, Yama will definitely not be able to drag him away!"
    No, the despicable enemy will never be able to defeat such tenacious soldiers. He will definitely get better.

    血书
    杨朔
    一九四八年冬天，在新保安歼灭敌人的王牌三十五军将近煞尾，残剩的敌人被压到一座大院里，早象快要掏干的水坑里的鱼，挤在最后一个泥水湾子里，拨浪拨浪乱拨浪，也无非是绝望的挣扎罢了。许多部队都撤出战斗，临时找个地方休息下来。我在瓮城圈里一带炸塌的工事前，遇到一个熟悉的连队，战士们浑身净尘土，显得挺疲乏，但是还有人吹着口琴，不时说几句笑话，隐藏不住他们胜利的心情。
    刘指导员一见我，一把抓住我的手，我也立时握紧他的手，只是一味地摇着。同志们中间，凡是经过重要事情后，乍一见面，常常是格外亲热，也不用费什么话，彼此的心情就完全结合到一起了。他拉我坐到一个防空洞里，从日记本当中拿出一张纸，递给我说：“你看看这个同志，实在是好！”
    那张纸上染了好多血，半干不干的，模模糊糊还能认清上边的字迹，只见写道：
    “我向上级要求火线立功入党，就是我死了，也要求能批准我入党。”
    下面写的名字是杨二妮。我念了这个名字几遍，觉得怪熟的，刘指导员提醒我道：“你忘了么？他原先在连部当通讯员，你还跟他谈过话。”
    我眼前立刻跳出一个年轻轻的影子：细挑身材，脸上带着股孩子气，嘴唇的左角一个乌痣，把他显得又机灵，又果断。那天我到连部去，一进门，看见他倚在门框子上，低着个头，满脸是泪。
    刘指导员望着我笑道：“你看看这个同志，咱光听说有家庭观念，他倒有部队观念，害疥疮，叫他到后方休养几天，怎么也不愿意离开部队。”
    杨二妮嘟嚷道：“我能走，也能动，叫我做啥我做啥，就是不到后方去。”
    指导员挥了挥手笑道：“算啦，算啦，我们答应你的意见。”
    杨二妮忍不住乐了，擦擦泪，一跳跳到院里去，立刻就听见他唱起歌来。他对部队的感情这样深，说清了，一点都不稀奇。他是山西广灵人，七岁上死了爹，娘穷的没法，逼着嫁了人，把他撂给他大娘，十二岁就给老财做零活。水缸挑不满要挨打，锄草不净也打。老财的儿子吃飞箩面，见他饿的慌，往馍上吐口唾沫，醮点尿，抹上大粪扔给他，他也吃，人家却拿着这个取乐。长到十七岁，谁摸过他的脑袋一下？谁问过他一声冷热？他活得象路边的小草，由着人踩，满肚子委屈都化成泪，还不敢哭，只能躲在阴山背后消消地流。
    自打参加了解放军，他第一次尝到人世间的温暖滋味。同志们跟他处的象亲兄弟一样，冷了脱衣裳给他穿，黑夜睡觉蹬了被子，有人替他盖。他生活在同志的友爱里，动不动想起先头的痛苦，指导员便让他在连里尽情地说。他说，旁人也说。敢情世间上净是苦人，怎么山南海北的凑到一块，说起来可象一个苦娘养的孩子？他变成连里诉苦的典型，这一来，情绪倒不安了，忽然向指导员要求调工作。
    刘指导员奇怪地瞪着他，他口气坚决地说：“在连部当通讯员，也不能常打仗。我要到班里去，亲手拿枪消灭祸害穷人的反动派！”他三番两次地要求。最后只好把他调走。
    他在班里当了战斗组长，同组的一个叫张殿英，一个外号小广东，都是解放战士。行军、练兵，杨二妮样样带头。打起仗来，更是又狠又猛。但他不是没有一点愿望的。人都有个希望。给人当小长工那时候，他渴望能睡个够、吃个饱。眼时活得是个主人了，可就要活得更有意思，更光荣。他渴望能争得共产党员这个称号。他早就把整个生命交给革命，毫不讲价钱，但这却是他惟一的希望。
    新保安的敌人一被包围起来，他这个战斗小组便做了立功计划，他自己更背着人，私下用“电笔”悄悄写了张入党志愿书，揣到贴身衣裳里。也怪，就这样一张纸，凭空可给他添了无穷的力量。发起攻击后，解放军的炮火响得象流水，朝着城头直砸，砸起障天高的尘土，什么都看不见。杨二妮借着炮火的掩护，带着战斗小组抢先爬上城去。紧接着又冲下城去，往街里压缩敌人。
    敌人已经乱了营，瞎放着枪，一边朝后跑。许多匪军迎着解放军把帽檐朝脑袋后一转，单腿一跪，双手举起枪来。杨二妮这时完全忘了自己，什么想头都没有，只有一个思想支配着他：敌人要是不投降，坚决消灭他！三十五军真是华北人民的大仇敌，曾经抢占了人民的城市张家口，到处烧杀掳掠，给人民造下多大的苦难。消灭敌人，就是消灭人民的苦难。敌人乱跑，他也不歇气地紧追。
    看看来到一个十字街口，忽然一阵又急又脆的机关枪迎面射来。子弹吱吱地乱飞。他急忙趴到一个墙角后，只听张殿英在他身边干喘道：“部队叫机枪按倒了，上不来啦！”
    十字街口有座地堡，象个蛤蟆似的蹲在那儿，机枪正是从地堡里射出来的。杨二妮的小组三个人上的猛，突到最前面，后边的部队一时叫机枪压倒，跟他们断了连络。
    张殿英骂道：“吊死鬼戴花，死不要脸！看你们还能兴到几时！”
    杨二妮说：“这个钉子不拔掉，队伍不能前进。想立功就在这回！”
    他对张殿英跟小广东把手一招，爬起来想冲，敌人的一颗炮弹炸了，把他一下子震倒，尘土迷的睁不开眼。尘土落一落，却见小广东震到一个坑里，头上炸了个口子，血往外直窜。他三下两下爬过去，由张殿英帮助把小广东拖到隐蔽地方，撕碎自己的衬衣给他包伤。
    小广东喘气象断丝，有气无力地说道：“你不用管我啦，组长！……管也是无用！”
    杨二妮急急地替他绑着伤口，嘴里说道：“你不用焦急，抬下去养几天就好了。咱们一个锅吃饭，一个炕睡觉，亲兄弟也不能这样，我不管你谁管你？”可是自己的左膀子怎么又酸又软，使不上劲。低下头一看，原来左棉袄袖子炸碎一大块，胳膊上打了三四块炮弹皮子，血把棉花都湿透了。
    张殿英急的说道：“组长，你下去吧！”
    杨二妮咬着牙说：“有我这口气，非跟狗＠的拚到底不可！”
    他把小广东安置到旁边一家民房里，自己绑了绑伤，手指头钩着手溜弹弦，对张殿英把头一摆，两个人一前一后，瞅冷子飞跑上去。地堡里又响了机枪，＠＠的，一颗子弹贴着他的头皮飞过去，好象一阵风，飕地掀掉他的帽子。他一扑扑进个炮弹坑里，喘了几口气，敌人的机枪才一停顿，冷不防他又跳起来，箭似的几步窜到地堡顶上，一边往枪眼里塞进两个手榴弹，大声喊道：“缴枪吧！不缴枪要你们的命！”
    地堡里炸的哇哇叫，枪从地堡眼里一个劲往外扔。张殿英赶上来，钻进地堡去扛出一挺轻机枪，押出五六个俘虏。正在这时，前边民房里一阵喊叫，敌人一个连反扑上来了。杨二妮急了眼，一把拖过刚缴的机枪，对着一个俘虏喝道：“你给我压子弹，我们的人就上来了！”
    那个俘虏倒乐的不行，立时帮着打起机枪来，一面象对自己说道：“谁不想缴枪啊！都是当官的拿枪逼着咱！”
    反扑的敌人也是叫当官的逼得没法。清清楚楚看得见一个军官隐在一座墙后，瞎抡着匣子枪，跺着脚叫。敌人反突一回，机枪一打，唰地退了，反突一回，唰地退了。可是杨二妮的后续部队怎么就没了影？他心里发急，打的更猛。敌人第五回又突上来了，没等打，先乱了群。杨二妮吼了一声，抱着机枪跳起来，冲着那个当官的掉过枪口，一下子把那人撩倒。他的前胸忽然一震，机枪从他怀里掉下去，一个筋头栽倒下去。
    就在这工夫，他的耳边响起一阵喊杀声，连长指挥着后续部队哗哗地上来了。敌人吓破了胆，乱纷纷地争着缴枪。
    张殿英扑到杨二妮身前，忙着给他绑伤，杨二妮却挣扎着叫道：“我还要冲锋！”但是他已经第二次挂花，打中了右胸，血流的太多，再也没有气力了。
    刘指导员跑上来，蹲下问道：“怎么样？怎么样？不要紧吧？”
    杨二妮嘴唇上的乌痣动了动，气促地喘道：“指导员我没能彻底歼灭敌人，实在对不起人民！”
    刘指导员握着他的手说：“你打的好，你打的太好啦，一定立功！”
    但是杨二妮还有更迫切的要求。他把手放到前胸，想拿东西，可又颤得拿不出来。指导员明白了他的意思，摸了一回，从他贴身衣裳里摸出了那张入党志愿书，差不多叫血湿透了大半张。
    杨二妮望着指导员小声问道：“你看我够入党的条件么？”
    刘指导员念着那张血书，感动得眼都潮了，扬起声音说道：“你为了革命，性命都不要了，还有比这个更忠诚的么？我代表党，现在就批准你入党！”
    这张血书传到我手里时，杨二妮已经带着安心的笑容，被抬到医院去了。我爱这个同志，更关心他的生命，忍不住问道：“你看他要不要紧？”
    刘指导员说道：“伤是不轻！不过那孩子打得顽强，命也顽强，阎王爷一定拖不走他！”
    不错，卑鄙的敌人永远打不倒这样顽强的战士。他一定会好起来的。
