Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15th: TASS, Washington, reports: Representatives of the American Communist Party and various progressive organizations denounced the North Atlantic Treaty at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and insisted that it should not be ratified. In a written statement, Dennis, General Secretary of the American Communist Party, stated that the North Atlantic Treaty is an aggressive military alliance that undermines the true interests and the welfare and security of the American people. The plan to arm Western European countries based on the North Atlantic Treaty means the further deterioration of the living standards of the American people and the economic situation in Western Europe. Dennis refuted the slander fabricated by American monopoly capitalists and their "two-party hucksters" about the Soviet threat, emphasizing that the Soviet Union pursues its consistent policy of supporting world peace. However, certain forces in the United States are planning a war against the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The statement further pointed out that the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty is being condemned by hundreds of millions of people around the world. The most prominent proof of this is the recent World Congress of Supporters of Peace. In the United States, it is also opposed by progressive organizations, the broad masses of working people, and prominent cultural leaders. Among union members, farmers, and black people, the aversion to the treaty is growing increasingly strongly. In view of the people's sentiment, the Senate should stop reviewing the North Atlantic Treaty. The statement continued: The American Communist Party calls for the conclusion of a treaty of peace and friendship with the Soviet Union to replace the aggressive military alliance, a general reduction of armaments, the implementation of the United Nations' resolution against warmongers, the destruction of atomic bombs, and a ban on the manufacture of atomic bombs. The statement concluded: A new world war is not inevitable. The people are fighting for peace. We are convinced that the American people will absolutely not be intimidated, but will organize themselves, unite as one, and defeat this notorious military alliance.
    Mrs. Delapre, Chairman of the American Women's Congress, said: The American Women's Congress also opposes the North Atlantic Treaty. American women do not want to send their brothers, sons, and husbands to a new war. The American people want better families, schools, and higher living standards. The people are working hard for peace. Mrs. Delapre said: We vow to oppose it with all our hearts and all our strength. Professor Warner, representing the National Council of Arts, Sciences, and Professions, Reverend Fuchs, a Protestant pastor representing the Philadelphia Committee of Arts, Sciences, and Professions, and representatives of other groups, also issued statements opposing the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　在参院外委会上
  　但尼斯痛斥北大西洋公约
    人民将击败这声名狼籍的军事联盟！
    【新华社北平十五日电】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国共产党和各进步团体的代表，在美参院外委会，痛斥北大西洋公约，坚主不应予以批准。美共总书记但尼斯在书面声明中称：北大西洋公约为破坏美国人民的真正利益及其福利与安全的侵略的军事联盟。依据北大西洋公约武装西欧国家的计划，意味着美国人民生活标准和西欧经济情况的愈益恶化。但尼斯驳斥美国独占资本家及其“两党商贩”捏造苏联威胁的诽谤之词，着重指出苏联奉行其支持世界和平的一贯政策。但美国的某些势力却正在筹划反对苏联和东欧国家的战争。声明进一步指出：侵略的北大西洋公约在全世界上受到数以亿万计的人民的同声斥责。在这方面最突出的证明是最近以前召开的世界拥护和平大会。在美国，也遭受进步组织、广大劳动人民与著名文化领袖的反对。在工会会员、农民与黑人中对于公约的反感正在日益强烈地增长着。鉴于人民的情绪，参院应该停止审查北大西洋公约。声明继称：美共号召缔结对苏联和平友好的公约，以代替侵略的军事联盟，普遍减缩军备、执行联合国反对战争贩子的决议、消毁原子弹，并禁止制造原子弹。声明结语宣称：新的世界战争并不是不可避免的。人民正在为和平而斗争。我们深信美国人民绝对不会被吓倒，而是组织起来，团结一致，击败这种声名狼籍的军事联盟。
    美国妇女大会主席德莱柏说：美国妇女大会也反对北大西洋公约。美国妇女不愿送他们的兄弟、儿子和丈夫到新的战争中。美国人民愿有较好的家庭、学校以及较高的生活标准。人民在努力争取和平。德莱柏说：我们誓以全心全力反对它。华尔纳教授代表艺术科学自由职业全国委员会、新教牧师富克斯代表艺术、科学自由职业费城委员会及其他团体的代表，也都发表反对批准北大西洋公约的声明。
