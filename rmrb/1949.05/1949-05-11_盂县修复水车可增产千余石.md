(Taiyue Electric) Yu County has achieved considerable success in repairing waterwheels. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the county had approximately 430 waterwheels (statistics missing for five villages). Due to years of destruction by the enemy and puppet regime, as well as damage from natural disasters and lack of repair, only 227 could be used with difficulty, causing over two thousand mu of paddy fields to become dry land. There were originally about 1,460 water-drawing pulleys, but only 821 are currently usable. When the government called for repairs, many problems were encountered: some people were afraid that converting dry land to paddy fields would increase their production and burdens; others had waterwheels that were completely broken and required a large amount of capital to repair, so they were afraid to borrow grain for repairs. In some cases, the ownership of waterwheels belonging to landlords and rich peasants had not been settled after liquidation, so repairs were not undertaken due to the uncertain ownership. These problems were studied at the county government's water conservancy meeting, and it was decided that if the grain borrowed by the masses was used for repairing waterwheels, a portion could be collected first if they were unable to repay it on time, and the rest could be deferred. If the ownership was uncertain, the cost of repairs would be paid according to its value should there be any changes in the future. To address the concerns of the masses about increased burdens due to increased production, it was explained that within two years of repairing the waterwheels, the land would still be taxed as dry land. Repairs started with those that were only slightly damaged, in order to influence and promote general repairs. After these problems were resolved, villages began to repair the waterwheels. This spring, 152 waterwheels have been repaired and are usable, and 448 water-drawing pulleys have been repaired this spring, irrigating approximately 2,600 mu of land, which is expected to increase production by over 1,500 shi.

    盂县修复水车可增产千余石
    【太岳电】孟县修复水车，已获得相当成绩。该县抗战前约计水车四百三十余架（缺五村统计），因连年敌伪摧残及灾荒失修，现勉强能用的仅二百二十七架，致使两千多亩水地变为旱田。浇田辘轳原有一千四百六十架左右，现能用的仅八百二十一架。在政府号召修复时，则遇到很多问题：群众有的怕旱田变水田后，多增产多负担，有的全部坏了的水车，修理需本很大，不敢贷粮修理。个别地主富农的水车已清算未分或未清算者，所有权没确定也不敢修理等，在县政府水利会议上，对这些问题都作了研究，决定群众贷粮只要用于修水车，如到期归还不起，可酌情先收一部，其余缓归。未确定所有权者，将来如有变动，根据修理费多寡作价付给。群众怕多产增加负担顾虑，说明修复水车辘轳地内，二年以内，仍按旱地负担。先后修理坏的不重者着手，以影响推动一般。如此解决问题后，各村开始修理起来。今春已修好能使用的有一百五十二架，辘轳今春修补的有四百四十八架，约可浇两千六百余亩，共可增产一千五百余石。
