    Several Issues in Shijiazhuang's In-Kind Value-Preserving Savings Deposits
    Xin Ru

    In-kind value-preserving deposits are a brand-new banking business and the most effective way for state banks to absorb deposits during periods of unstable prices. For depositors, money is protected from the impact of price fluctuations. For banks, it can absorb large amounts of floating capital, stabilize the market, and channel these scattered funds into production in a planned way, developing the state-owned economy. Therefore, the fundamental spirit of in-kind value-preserving savings deposits is mutually beneficial to both the public and private sectors.

    The Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank of China piloted in-kind value-preserving deposits and in-kind value-preserving savings deposits using two different methods in February of this year. Both methods use "li" as the unit of calculation. At the time of deposit, the money is converted into "li," and at the time of withdrawal, the "li" are converted back into money. One "li" is the sum of the prices of six commodities: two jin of rice, one jin of wheat, five qian of oil, five qian of salt, one square chi of cloth, and one and a half jin of coal. According to the prices set by the city's trading company, the average price of various commodities is changed every five days.

    The first type of deposit is limited to state-owned enterprises, production units of government agencies, cadres, workers, staff and students. Depositors must have a letter of introduction from their agency, factory, or school. Workers in private factories must have a firm letter of introduction from the city's Federation of Trade Unions.

    Deposits for one month are principal-protected without interest. For two months to one year, deposits under 1 million New Currency yuan earn interest ranging from 3 to 9 li. Deposits over 1 million yuan earn interest ranging from 3.5 to 1 fen. If the deposit is not withdrawn upon maturity, it will be transferred to a current account. If, upon maturity, prices have fallen and the original amount of currency cannot be withdrawn, the original deposit amount will be paid.

    The second type of deposit is for the general public, divided into four types: lump-sum deposit and withdrawal, deposit of principal with interest paid periodically, zero deposit with lump-sum withdrawal, and lump-sum deposit with periodic withdrawal. The minimum deposit period for lump-sum deposit and withdrawal is three months, with interest ranging from 3 to 7.5 li. The minimum deposit period for the remaining three types is six months, with interest ranging from 3 to 6 li.

    Based on the bank's experience in operating this business for the past two months, the following issues should be raised for discussion:

    First, if in-kind value-preserving deposits primarily target public enterprises and production units of government agencies, then it should be limited to funds like public welfare funds. If funds beyond this scope are absorbed, it indicates that the depositing enterprise has not fully utilized its effectiveness in management. The bank is catering to and encouraging the idea of poor management. Although it has been found in the past that some public funds have become floating capital in the market, this is not a problem that can be solved by bank deposit business; rather, enterprise management should be strengthened and operations should be supervised. Otherwise, what is the point of the bank absorbing these funds and then investing them in production?

    Therefore, the main target of in-kind value preservation should be personal savings, concentrating scattered floating capital and investing it in production. This is the correct spirit of the savings business.

    Second, giving cadres, workers, staff, and students preferential treatment over the general public, requiring them to bring a letter of introduction for deposits, not only restricts the deposits of the general public but also makes cadres and workers feel it is too much trouble. In the past two months, very few deposits from individuals have come from the general public, and many workers have not brought letters of introduction when depositing. Since the deposit is conditional on in-kind value preservation and aims to absorb floating capital, cadres and workers should not receive any "extra" preferential treatment, and the general public should not be subject to unnecessary restrictions. Otherwise, it will contradict the purpose of absorbing floating capital.

    Third, every time the market fluctuates, calculating the price every five days creates a large difference between deposit and withdrawal. For example, if a deposit is made on the first day of the price calculation period, and the price suddenly changes the next day, it is as if the depositor is starting to preserve value for the four days before the deposit was made! Conversely, if someone comes to withdraw on the first day of a price change and prices are rising, they will suffer a loss of four days of not preserving value. Therefore, the price must be calculated daily to truly reflect the original meaning of value preservation.

    Fourth, the savings department of the bank constantly has deposits that are not withdrawn upon maturity. One reason is deposits from other places, and another is that depositors are negligent or unaware of the deposit regulations. If prices rise, and the delay in withdrawal is slightly longer, then the change in the deposit after it is converted to a current account can be significant. Therefore, in addition to the agreed-upon time, the bank should grant appropriate extensions based on the specific reasons for the delay, changing the item "converting overdue withdrawals to current accounts" to "converting withdrawals to current accounts after a few days of being overdue." Otherwise, it will lead to complaints from depositors.

    As of the end of March, the bank's in-kind value-preserving deposits totaled more than 240 million RMB, of which more than 220 million yuan were from state-owned enterprises and production units of government agencies. Deposits from workers, cadres, and students totaled more than 20 million yuan, with very few deposits from the general public. In March, in-kind value-preserving deposits accounted for about one-sixth of all deposits. Because this business is still in the trial stage, and credit is being tightened, many of these funds have not been properly utilized, which makes many cadres confused, thinking this is a loss-making business. This thinking is, of course, due to an insufficient understanding of the fundamental spirit of in-kind value-preserving deposits; however, the leadership should also promptly implement the original plan and channel funds into production in a timely manner. Otherwise, the role of in-kind value-preserving deposits will be limited to simply absorbing deposits, and its significance will seem narrow.

    石市实物保本储蓄存款中的几个问题
    辛茹
    实物保本存款，是一门崭新的银行业务，是国家银行在物价不稳定时吸收存款最有效的方法。对存款者，有钱不受物价影响；在银行方面，可以大量吸收游资，稳定市场，并把这些零碎收进的款子，有计划的投向生产，发展国营经济。所以，实物保本储蓄存款的基本精神是公私两利。
    中国人民银行石家庄分行本年二月间先后以两种不同的方法试办实物保本存款及实物保本储蓄存款。两种方法都是以厘为计算单位，存款时将款折厘，取款时厘将折款。一个厘即二斤米、一斤麦、五钱油、五钱盐、一方尺布、一斤半炭等六种物资价格之和。依照本市贸易公司所订价格，每五天按各种物资平均价格更换一次价。
    第一种存款对象限于国营企业、机关生产、干部、职工及学生等。存款者必须带有机关、工厂、学校的介绍信。私营工厂工人存款必须有市总工会的切实介绍信。
    存一个月者保本无息，两个月到一年，存款在新币一百万元以下者，利息由三厘到九厘。一百万元以上者，利息由三厘五到一分。逾期不提存者，即转入活期存款。如存款期满，物价下落，不能取回原存货币数量时，可按原存数付给。
    第二种存款对象为一般市民，分整存整取、存本付息、零存整付，整存零付等四种。整存整付起码存三个月，利息由三厘到七厘五。其余三种存期起码六个月。利息由三厘到六厘。
    根据该行两个月来经营这门业务的情形，发觉有以下几个问题应该提出研究：
    第一、实物保本存款若以公营企业及机关生产为主要对象，那应该只限于公积金、公益金之类的款。假若超过这个范围把资金吸收来了，那说明存款的企业在经营上没有充分发挥它的效能。而银行正迎合和鼓励了经营落后的思想。虽然过去曾发现部分公营资金变成市场上的游资，但这不是银行存款业务上能解决的问题；而应该加强企业管理，督促经营。否则，银行把这些款子吸收进来，再投向生产事业，何苦多此一举呢？
    因此，实物保本的主要对象应该是个人储蓄，把零散的游资集中起来投向生产，这才是正确的储蓄业务的精神。
    第二、对干部、职工、学生存款比一般市民优待，存款时要带有介纷信，这种做法不仅限制了一般市民的存款，而且也使干部职工感到太麻烦。两个月来的情况，是个人存款中一般市民只有很少的几笔，而许多工人存款时却没有带介绍信。既然存款是以实物保本为条件，是以吸收游资为目的，那对干部、职工就不应该含有任何“额外”的优待，而对一般市民也不应加以不必要的限制，否则就与吸收游资的目的相违背了。
    第三、每逢市场波动，五天计算一次价，存取款之间就发生很大差别。如在计算价的头一天存进，第二天价就突然变了，等于存户在未存入的前四天就开始保本了！相反的，在价变动的头一天来取款，若物价是上涨，那就要吃四天不能保本的亏。所以价必须是每天计算一次，才能真正切合保本的原意。
    第四、该行储蓄部不断有到期存款不来提的，其中一种是外埠存款，一种是存户疏忽或不知道存款规章的。这种情形遇到物价上涨，延提时间稍长一些，那该项存款转为活期后，起的变化可能很大。所以，除议定的时间之外，银行应根据具体延提的原因，予以适当延期的优待，把“过期不提转为活期存款”一项，改为过期几天不提即改为活期存款。否则要遭到存户埋怨的。
    该行实物保本存款到三月底止，总额达二亿四千多万人民币，其中公营企业、机关生产占二亿二千多万元。职工、干部、学生二千多万元，一般市民存款极少。以三月份计，实物保本存款约占全部存款六分之一。因为这门业务还在试办，又逢紧缩信用，这部分款多未适当运用，这使许多干部思想搞不通，认为这是赔本业务。这种思想当然还是对实物保本存款的基本精神认识不够；但在领导上也应该及时履行原订计划，及时的把资金提向生产事业。否则，实物保本存款的作用只限于单纯的吸收存款，它的意义就显得窄狭了。
