　　【Taiyuan Dispatch】 The No. 1 ore smelting furnace of the iron smelting section of the Taiyuan Northwest Steel Plant began smelting ore and producing iron on April 26. In the ten days up to May 6, the number of workers did not increase, but the iron output has more than tripled compared to pre-liberation days. It is estimated that after another ten days, it can reach the furnace's maximum smelting capacity. The reasons for the increase in the furnace's output are, first, the workers' love for the factory, saving of raw materials, and changed work attitude, and second, the continuous supply of raw materials. For example, when the furnace is tapped, the workers no longer use oxygen, relying solely on manpower. Supervisor Wang Dianchen, despite being injured, continues to work with crutches. Raw materials are continuously delivered to the factory.
    【Taiyuan Dispatch】(Late Arrival) Workers at the Taiyuan Motorcycle and Automobile Repair Factory No. 22, through voluntary overtime work, repaired 95 vehicles in nine days. After receiving the glorious task on April 28 to rush repairs on vehicles for a certain artillery unit heading south, in order to speed up the completion of the task, 86 out of the factory's 108 workers voluntarily requested to work overtime; many workers often worked until after 12 noon before eating breakfast. In particular, workers Yu Shitou, Yang Hongyu, and others worked even more actively. When the power supply was cut off, affecting the progress of work, workers Zheng Zichang, Zhang Ming, and others repaired the blower, using bellows to blow the blower instead of electric welding. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the workers, they repaired 80 vehicles in six days by May 3. Subsequently, they rushed repairs for the public transportation company, and as of the 6th, they have repaired a total of 95 vehicles.

　　太原西北炼钢厂复工十天
  　一号熔铁炉增产二倍
    汽车修理厂九日修车九十五辆
    【太原电】太原市西北炼钢厂炼铁课第一号熔矿炉自四月二十六日开始熔矿出铁，到五月六日的十天时间中，工人并无增加，但出铁数量已超过解放前的三倍，据估计再过十天后，即可达该炉的最高熔力。该炉产量增加之原因首先是工人爱护工厂，节省原料，改变了劳动态度，和原料的不断供应。如该炉出铁打眼时工人已不用氧气，净用人力。监工王殿臣虽负伤仍扶杖继续工作，原料源源运来该厂。
    【太原电】（迟到）太原摩托汽车修理二十二厂工人，自动加工、九天内修好九十五辆汽车。上月二十八日接到给南征的某炮兵单位赶修汽车的光荣任务后，为加快完成任务，全厂一百零八名工友中，即有八十六人自动要求加工；许多工友经常工作到中午十二点以后才吃早饭。特别是工友于石头、杨鸿玉等干活更积极。电源不通，影响工作的进行，工友郑子昌、张明等，就修好了鼓风炉，用拉风箱吹鼓风炉来代替电焊。在工友们忘掉疲劳的苦干下，至五月三号六天中就修好了八十辆汽车。接着又给公共汽车公司赶修，截至六日，他们前后共已修复汽车九十五辆。
