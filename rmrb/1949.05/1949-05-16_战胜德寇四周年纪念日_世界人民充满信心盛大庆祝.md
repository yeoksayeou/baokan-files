　　Fourth Anniversary of the Victory over Nazi Germany
  　World People Celebrate Grandly with Full Confidence
    May 9th marks the fourth anniversary of the victory over Hitler's Germany. The Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries of Eastern Europe held enthusiastic celebrations on this day. In Moscow, the Soviet capital, the capitals of the various republics, and heroic cities such as Stalingrad, grand mass rallies were held simultaneously. As everyone knows, the Soviet people and their armed forces were the main force that played a decisive role in the victory over Nazi Germany. In the heroic and victorious struggle, the Soviet people not only defended the freedom and independence of the Soviet homeland, and rescued the people and culture of the European nations, but also crushed the conspiracy of the Anglo-American ruling clique to delay the opening of the second front, and attempt to exhaust the Soviet army in fighting the enemy alone. Today, as the Anglo-American ruling clique is following in Hitler's footsteps, preparing to provoke a new war, the Soviet people and the people of European countries, and even the people of the world, are celebrating this great festival, which further strengthens their confidence in defending world peace and democracy.

　　战胜德寇四周年纪念日
  　世界人民充满信心盛大庆祝
    五月九日是战胜希特勒德国的四周年纪念日。苏联及东欧新民主国家都在这天举行了热烈的庆祝。苏京莫斯科，各加盟共和国首都及斯大林格勒等英雄城市，同时举行了盛大的群众庆祝大会。尽人皆知，苏联人民及其武装力量，是在战胜纳粹德国中起了决定作用的主力军。苏联人民在英勇与胜利的斗争中，不仅保卫了苏维埃祖国的自由与独立，拯救了欧洲各族人民及其文化，而且也粉碎了美英统治集团拖延开辟第二战场，图使苏军在单独对敌作战中打得精疲力竭的阴谋。今天，在美英统治集团正在步希特勒后尘，准备挑起新战争的时候，苏联人民和欧洲各国人民以至全世界人民，庆祝这一伟大的节日，便更增强了保卫世界和平民主的信心。
