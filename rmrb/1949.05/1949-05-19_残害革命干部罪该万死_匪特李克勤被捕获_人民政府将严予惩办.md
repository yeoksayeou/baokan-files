　　Murdering Revolutionary Cadres Deserves Ten Thousand Deaths!
    Counter-revolutionary Special Agent Li Keqin Captured
  　The People's Government Will Punish Him Severely
    [Reported by this newspaper] The murderer who assassinated Comrade Dong Junling, a working cadre of our Dispersed Military Personnel Handling Committee – counter-revolutionary special agent Li Keqin, was captured by the Public Security Bureau on April 2nd. The bandit Li Keqin is a major local thug, consistently hostile to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Last year, Li Hangsen, director of the political work office of the 1st Regiment of Chiang bandit's 208th Division, introduced the bandit Li to join the regiment for special agent work; after the liberation of Tangshan, he sneaked into Beiping. Comrade Dong had previously done underground work for the 208th Division and knew very well about the criminal behavior of the bandit Li. After the liberation of Beiping, he repeatedly persuaded the bandit Li to perform meritorious service to atone for his crimes and ordered him to report the criminal activities of his brother-in-law, Wang Wenbin, a special agent of the pseudo-Military Statistics Bureau; unexpectedly, the bandit Li remained incorrigible and conspired to poison Comrade Dong. On March 10th, at 4 p.m., he lured Comrade Dong to the former site of Yuanmingyuan, the Three Immortals Cave of the Double Crane Studio, and after tricking Comrade Dong out of his pistol, he shot Comrade Dong inside the Three Immortals Cave. Afterwards, he covered Comrade Dong's body with a large stone slab in an attempt to destroy the evidence. According to various clues, the Sixth Branch of our Public Security Bureau finally captured the bandit Li on April 2nd and uncovered the pistol and twelve bullets robbed by the bandit Li in the home of his wife, Li Xiao Juan's aunt (No. 19 Gongmenkou Toutiao, this city). The bandit Li confessed to his criminal acts. This bandit harmed revolutionary patriots and continued his anti-people and counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities. His crimes are evident and will be subject to the most severe punishment by the People's Government.

　　残害革命干部罪该万死
    匪特李克勤被捕获
  　人民政府将严予惩办
    【本报讯】刺杀我流散军人处理委员会工作干部董峻岭同志之凶手——匪特李克勤，已于四月二日被公安局捕获。李匪克勤是一个大地主流氓，一贯仇视共产党与人民解放军。去年蒋匪二○八师一团政工室主任李行森，介绍李匪加入该团作特务工作；唐山解放后，即潜来北平。董同志曾在为二○八师做地下工作，对李匪罪恶行为知之甚详。北平解放后，曾再三规劝李匪立功赎罪，并令其报告他的姐夫伪军统局特务王文彬罪恶活动；孰料李匪怙恶不悛，竟阴谋毒杀董同志，于三月十日下午四时，将董同志诱入圆明园故址双鹤斋三仙洞，骗取董同志手枪后，即在三仙洞内将董同志枪杀，事后用大石板覆在董同志尸体上，企图灭迹。我公安局外六分局根据种种线索，终于四月二日将李匪捕获，并在其妻李笑娟姑母家（本市宫门口头条十九号）地下起出李匪所劫之手枪及子弹十二粒，李匪对其行凶事，供认不讳。该匪残害革命志士，继续其反人民反革命阴谋活动，罪恶昭彰，将受到人民政府最严厉之惩办。
