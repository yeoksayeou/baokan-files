Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th—A number of factories and enterprises in Nanjing have resumed production. The former 60th Arsenal has officially resumed work. Many workers in the factory enthusiastically contributed equipment before the resumption of work and held meetings to discuss ways to resume work. Chen Zirong, an old worker who has been working in the factory since the age of seventeen, said, "I have been working for thirty-nine years, and this is the first time I have heard workers discuss their own work and say what they want to say at their own meetings." After the repair and maintenance plants of the First Transportation Office of the Highway Administration Bureau resumed work on the 6th, they assembled two cars within three days. The 326 Automobile Factory has repaired 19 cars in the six days since it started work. More than a dozen workers at the Radio Equipment Factory increased their production efficiency by one-third after resuming work on the 9th. Other state-owned enterprises such as the electric light factory, the wired electrical equipment factory, and the battery company have not stopped work before or after liberation. The private Youheng Flour Company, which normally produces 8,000 bags of flour per day, has partially resumed work on the 10th with the assistance of the Nanjing Trade Corporation by paying in advance and purchasing finished products. Once the problems of raw material and power supply are resolved, production can be fully restored.

　　南京部分企业恢复生产
    【新华社南京十二日电】南京市的一部分工厂、企业已恢复生产。原六十兵工厂已正式复工。该厂不少工人在复工前，踊跃献纳器材，并开会讨论复工的办法等。从十七岁起就一直在该厂工作的老工人陈子荣说：“我做了三十九年的工，还是第一次听到工人在自己的会上讨论自己的工作，讲自己要讲的话。”公路总局第一运输处的修理、保养两厂六日复工后，三日内配好汽车两辆。三二六汽车厂开工后六天，已修好汽车十九辆。无线电器材制造厂的十多个工人，九日复工后的生产效率较过去提高了三分之一。其他如电灯工厂、有线电器材制造厂、电瓶公司等公营企业。在解放前后，均未停工。平时日产面粉八千袋的私营有恒面粉公司，经南京贸易总公司以先付款项、收购成品的方式扶助，已于十日部分复工，一俟原料及电力供应问题解决后，生产即可全部恢复。
