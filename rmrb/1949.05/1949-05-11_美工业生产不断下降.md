Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th -- TASS reports: US production has continuously declined in the first four months of this year, and the downward trend has spread from light industry to heavy industry. According to Knowles, chairman of the President's Economic Advisory Committee, preliminary estimates put the production index for April at 179 (with 1939 as 100), compared to 195 in December of last year, a decline of more than 8 percent. U.S. News & World Report writes: "The decline in production that began last December is now intensifying. The expected rise in the spring months has not materialized. The outlook for production is for more declines...And what really matters is that this decline is hitting heavy industry. Although there are no April production statistics for many sectors, existing reports show that despite desperate efforts to expand armaments, the decline in steel production could not be saved. The oil, machinery, textile, and footwear industries also declined in April. American newspapers report almost daily on factories laying off workers and reducing production.

    美工业生产
    不断下降
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社讯：今年头四个月来美国生产不断下降，生产下降的趋势已由轻工业扩及重工业。据总统经济顾问委员会主席诺尔斯称：初步估计四月份生产指数是一七九（以一九三九年为一○○），而去年十二月则为一九五，下降百分之八强。美国新闻与世界报道周刊称：“去年十二月开始的生产下降，到现在正日益加剧着。在今春数月中，预期的上升并没有成为事实。生产的前景是更多的下降。………而真正关系重大的事情则是这一个时候的下降打击了重工业。虽然在许多部门中还没有四月份生产统计，但现有的报告显示：尽管拼命扩大军备，仍挽救不了钢产的下降，石油、机器、纺织、鞋袜等工业在四月份内也都下降。美国报纸上几乎天天有各工厂解雇工人与减少生产的消息。
