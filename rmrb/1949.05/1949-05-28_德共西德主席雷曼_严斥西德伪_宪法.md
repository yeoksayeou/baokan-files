　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 27th: TASS, Berlin dispatch: Following the announcement of the divided West German "constitution" at the Bonn Parliamentary Council meeting on the 23rd, Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party "West Germany," issued the following statement to reporters in Bonn: "The splitters of Germany want all members of the 'Parliamentary Council' to sign the 'constitution.' To achieve this, the minutes of the meeting record: The 'constitution' of the Federal Republic of Germany was passed on May 8, 1949, by a vote of fifty-three to twelve. At the Senate meeting, I protested against the plan stipulating the entry into force of the 'constitution' of the Federal Republic of Germany. I announced, in accordance with our position during the nine months of work of the 'Parliamentary Council,' that this 'constitution' is a set of instructions on how to implement the occupation regulations. The legal division of Germany is being realized through the West German 'constitution' and 'occupation regulations.' I further announce that, for the above reasons, the Communist Party caucus cannot sign the 'constitution.' The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has now begun work in Paris to find a solution to the German question; at this time of great importance to the German people, West German politicians are calculating the possibility of the Foreign Ministers Conference failing so as to realize the division of our motherland."

　　德共西德主席雷曼
  　严斥西德伪“宪法”
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社柏林讯：分裂的西德“宪法”在二十三日的波恩议会委员会的会议上宣布后，德国共产党“西德”主席雷曼在波恩对记者发表声明如下：“德国的分裂者们愿意让‘议会委员会’的一切委员都在‘宪法’上签字。为达到这一点，会议记录上记载着：德意志联邦共和国‘宪法’在一九四九年五月八日以五十三票对十二票通过。在参议院的集会上，我曾抗议规定德意志联邦共和国‘宪法’生效的方案。我曾按照我们的立场在‘议会委员会’进行工作的九个月时间中宣布，这个‘宪法’乃是关于如何实施占领法规的条文训令。德国在法律上的分裂正通过西德‘宪法’与‘占领法规’实现中。我进一步宣布：由于上述原因，共产党党团不能在‘宪法’上签字。四外长会议现已在巴黎开始工作，以求找出全德问题的解决；在这个对于德国人民具有极大重要性的时机，西德政治家们却在盘算着外长会议工作失败的可能性，俾能实现我们祖国的分裂。”
