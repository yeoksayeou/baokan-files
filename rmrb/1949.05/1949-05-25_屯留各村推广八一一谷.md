　　[Taiyue Telegram] Currently, villages in Tunliu County are planting millet. The county's farm is promoting the "811" millet seed in Yuzhen, which has been enthusiastically welcomed by the farmers. The farm staff conducted in-depth publicity based on the past planting experience of the masses. Many farmers said, "We have planted this millet before. It is drought-resistant, the rice tastes good, and it yields a lot of rice." The farmers said, "If you want to eat rice, plant 'Ba Yi Yi Shan' (a nickname for 811 millet)". Three jin from you, five jin from me. In two days, the village exchanged 250 jin of "811" millet seeds from the farm, and 45 households are now sowing.

　　屯留各村推广八一一谷
    【太岳电】屯留各村目前正在种谷，该县农场在余镇推广“八一一”谷种，受到农民热烈欢迎。农场工作人员事先根据过去群众种植的经验，进行了深入的宣传。好多农民都说：“这谷过去我们种过，耐旱、米好吃、出米多。”农民们说：“要吃米饭，就种一把扇（八一一谷的别名）”，你三斤，我五斤，两天该村便在农场里换去了“八一一”谷种二百五十斤，有四十五户正在下种。
