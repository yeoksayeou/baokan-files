    Chapter One: The Incident
    Suddenly, Hei Lao Cai straightened up, raised a hand, and said with a strange and meaningful look in his eyes, "Alright! Those who want to eat glutinous rice cake, follow me!" Zhang Jinlong lowered an eyebrow and said fiercely, "Hey Cai, don't joke around!" Hei Lao Cai raised his head and said, "You have superiors, and we have superiors too. If you want to eat glutinous rice cake, follow me to Commander Lü's place to eat!" Gao Tun'er said, "That's right! Commander Lü has plenty of glutinous rice cakes!" People outside also shouted, "Go to Commander Lü's place! Go to Commander Lü's place!" Guo San Mazi's eyes widened like bull's eggs, he suddenly stood up, slapped the table, and said to Hei Lao Cai, "Bullshit! We don't recognize any Donkey Commander or Cow Commander! This guy is deliberately causing trouble, tie him up!" Several people rushed up to grab Hei Lao Cai. Lao Cai took out a Mauser pistol, took a step forward, and shouted loudly, "Who dares to tie me up!" Liu Shuangxi and his gang, some carrying guns, some holding grenades, all crowded into the room.
    Just at that moment, there was a sound of horses' hooves outside, and three soldiers came, all wearing gray coarse cloth uniforms, jumped off their horses, and walked into the courtyard. The one in front asked, "Where is Captain Cai?" People said, "He's in the room." He ran into the room, and when he saw Hei Lao Cai, he quickly shook hands and greeted him. Hei Lao Cai happily said, "Instructor, you're all here?" The instructor said, "The main force is behind, we came ahead to make contact with you." Hei Lao Cai said, "Good, good, good, let's go over there and talk." He told the self-defense team to take them to the west room. Here, Guo San Mazi and his gang were all dumbfounded. Zhang Jinlong secretly nudged Guo San Mazi and said, "Let's go." San Mazi then said loudly, "It's getting late today, we'll come back tomorrow!" Li Liu Zi said, "Yes, we'll eat glutinous rice cake tomorrow!" This gang of punks all slipped away.
    What came was part of Commander Lü's troops; after settling down, they specialized in suppressing bandits and reorganizing local armed forces. They sent people to negotiate with He Shixiong, asking him to resist Japan, to accept leadership, and to abide by discipline; if he did not obey, their guns would be confiscated. He Shixiong had no choice but to accept everything.
    Six
    On the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month, Hei Lao Cai sent Niu Da Shui to He Zhuang market to buy gunpowder. Da Shui bought the gunpowder and was walking on the street when he suddenly heard gunfire behind him, and a burst of indistinct noises. The people at the market hurriedly moved aside, squeezing Da Shui onto the steps. He turned his head and saw Li Liu Zi carrying a three-eyed musket, clearing the way; behind him followed six musicians, playing music, leading a blue sedan chair, and a red satin embroidered golden sedan chair; behind the sedan chair followed many people carrying Mauser pistols, all walking very imposingly.
    Da Shui thought, "Who is showing off like this?" After asking around, he learned that it was Zhang Jinlong marrying a wife, marrying someone from Da Yang Village. A woman holding a child next to him said, "Not from Da Yang Village, Da Yang Village is her maternal grandmother's home." Da Shui heard this and felt a jolt in his heart, and asked, "What's her last name?" The woman said, "Maybe it's Liang." Da Shui said, "Could it be Yang?" The woman laughed and said, "Who knows!" Da Shui thought dazedly, "Could it be Yang Xiaomei?" He stared blankly, as the sedan chair went further and further away.
    At this moment, Xiaomei was sitting in the sedan chair, shedding tears. She had long heard that Zhang Jinlong was a rascal who didn't live properly. A few days ago, Xiaomei lay on the kang pretending to be sick, covering her head with a quilt, constantly crying; but her mother said, her grandmother also persuaded, and when the sedan chair came, she had no choice!
    Suddenly – boom! boom! boom! Three cannons fired. The sedan chair landed.
    [Note] ⑧ rascal: *ga* means bad.
　　Chapter Two: The Communist Party
    Stars and the moon,
    The common people and the Communist Party.
    --Folksong
    One
    Xiaomei went through the door and was a new bride for three days, had three days of good life. On the fourth day, her mother-in-law "needed work done," according to the old rules, Xiaomei had to make her a pair of cotton trousers. The mother-in-law turned the cotton trousers over and over, looked at them again and again, and then began to find fault: the stitches here were too big, the cotton stuffing there wasn't even, and she made several sarcastic remarks. After the New Year, Xiaomei came back from her maternal grandmother's house and started working busily. Her mother-in-law's family had many people, Xiaomei had to push the millstone twice a day, cook two meals, and also split reeds, grind reeds, and weave a twelve-foot mat, but she only had two hands!
    The mother-in-law's family used to be wealthy, but it declined in Zhang Jinlong's grandfather's time, and now only a dilapidated courtyard was left. The whole family relied on Zhang Jinlong to swindle money and extort wealth outside, eat good food, wear good clothes, and put on a show. They looked down on "dead farmers" and bullied Yang Xiaomei. They ate good food, but Xiaomei often went hungry. Once, the father-in-law smoked enough opium, and was happy for a moment, and said to Xiaomei, "You are grinding reeds, take a bun to eat." Xiaomei had just taken a bite when the mother-in-law came in and said, "Good daughter-in-law, do you have double intestines?" The father-in-law said, "Let her eat her fill so she can work well." The mother-in-law pursed her lips and didn't say anything. Xiaomei couldn't eat anymore either, put the bun in the basket and went to grind reeds. This young daughter-in-law, with a bun tied behind her head, wearing a wide cotton-padded jacket, pulled the big stone roller while shedding tears.
    The mother-in-law also guarded against Xiaomei like a thief, locking all the rice and flour in her own suite, and having to personally scoop it out for every meal, not allowing Xiaomei to touch it. Even the "padding paper" and "lining" for making shoes had to be taken out of the cabinet by the mother-in-law with a key and given to her. Xiaomei really couldn't bear the humiliation, and she couldn't talk to her husband. That man had a big temper, always frowning and glaring. Xiaomei didn't want to say anything in front of him, and even her mouth was about to rust. She wanted to go to her mother to complain, but her mother had gone home, and it was a long way. Xiaomei had no choice but to find a chance to run to her sister's house to cry and hide. Da Shui felt very sad when he heard that Xiaomei was suffering like this; but Xiaomei had already become someone else's person, so what could he do?
    Two
    The enemy came to attack once in the twelfth lunar month of the previous year. Our newly formed troops went to the Bian River and fought for three days and three nights, driving the enemy back. This year in the spring, the enemy came for the second time, with a much larger force, more than a thousand people, all with livestock pulling artillery, and with airplanes for cover. The troops on this side only had more than three hundred, and they persisted on the riverbank for a whole day before being attacked by the enemy and occupied the county seat. Our troops are in the countryside, cooperating with the local Party, continuing to organize the masses, and develop armed forces…
    The county propaganda team often comes to Shen's Village, and there are also "Red Army women," also wearing blue uniforms, carrying flags, shouting slogans in the streets, brushing slogans, and giving speeches on stage. Xiaomei sometimes comes to her sister's house and goes to meetings with them, and sees that those "Red Army women" can speak and write, and are not oppressed, and Xiaomei is really envious. Looking at Niu Da Shui, Da Shui has a white towel wrapped around his head, wears a blue lined jacket, a bullet belt around his waist, and carries a big gun on his shoulder, and he walks around the street excitedly. Even Niu Xiao Shui has joined the Children's National Salvation Association, and practices every day, singing, very lively. But Xiaomei can't stay at her sister's house for more than three days, and her mother-in-law will send someone to find her, and no matter what, she has to call her back.
    In the autumn, the peasant association was established. Hei Lao Cai was transferred to the work team, in charge of several villages. Da Shui also became a cadre in the village peasant association. Shen Yaozong said behind his back: "Ha! These guys, who can't read a word and have heads full of sorghum flowers, can also do something?" He was even more dissatisfied when rent reduction and interest reduction were arranged in the village, and he did everything he could to cause trouble in secret. Later, hundreds of people from the peasant association went to the county to sue him, and seeing that he couldn't hold on, he became honest; when he saw Niu Da Shui, he nodded and greeted him with a smile. Da Shui was relieved; his father calculated that over the years, the interest alone had accumulated to one hundred strings of cash, and people had saved the documents, and if he didn't pay it off this year, the land would be lost. But with rent reduction and interest reduction, the land was preserved, and there was still a bowl of rice to eat. The old man was so happy that he said, "If it weren't for the peasant association, people would have strangled us this year. Good boy, work hard." Da Shui worked even harder. (Attached image)
    They wanted to catch Hei Lao Cai. Lao Cai shouted, "Who dares to tie me up!"
    Niu Da Shui was stunned: "Could it be that Yang Xiaomei is in the sedan chair?"
    Yang Xiaomei was pulling the big stone roller while shedding tears.

    第一回　事变
    忽然，黑老蔡直了身子，举起一只手，怪有意思的＠着眼睛，说：“好吧！要吃潮脂糕的跟我走！”张金龙一条眉毛压下来，狠狠的说：“姓蔡的，你别开玩笑！”黑老蔡扬着脑袋说：“你们有上级，我们也有上级，要吃潮脂糕，跟我到吕司令那儿吃去！”高屯儿说：“着！吕司令那儿潮脂糕多得很！”门外也都喊起来：“到吕司令那儿去！到吕司令那儿去！”郭三麻子眼睛瞪得跟牛蛋子似的，猛的站起来，对黑老蔡拍着桌子说：“放你娘的屁！我们不认得什么驴司令牛司令！这家伙故意捣乱，把他捆起来！”几个人就冲上来抓黑老蔡。老蔡拿着盒子枪，走上一步，大声喝着说：“谁敢捆我！”刘双喜一伙，有的提着枪，有的拿着手榴弹，都拥进屋里来。
    正在这工夫，外面一阵马蹄声，来了三个军人，都穿着灰粗布军装，跳下马，走进院子。头前一个问：“蔡队长在哪儿？”人们说：“在屋里呢。”他跑进屋里，一见黑老蔡，忙握手招呼。黑老蔡高兴的说：“教导员，你们都来啦？”那教导员说：“大队在后面，我们先来跟你接接头。”黑老蔡说：“好好好，咱们过那边谈谈。”就和自卫队招呼他们到西屋去了。这儿，郭三麻子一伙都傻了眼儿。张金龙暗里推推郭三麻子说：“咱们走吧。”三麻子就高声说：“今天时候不早了，明儿个再来要吧！”李六子说：“对，潮脂糕明天再吃！”这一伙毛蛋蛋子，一个个都溜了。
    来的是吕司令的一部分队伍；住下以后，专门剿土匪，整顿地方武装。他们派人跟何世雄交涉，要他抗日，要他接受领导，遵守纪律；如果不服从，就要缴他们的枪。何世雄没办法，全部接受了。
    六
    腊月初十，黑老蔡打发牛大水到何庄集上买火药。大水买了火药，正在街上走，忽然听见后面枪响，和一阵咪哩嘛啦的声音。赶集的人们纷纷往两边让开，把大水挤到台阶上了。他扭头一看，瞧见李六子端着个三眼枪，在开道冲邪呢；后面跟着六个吹鼓手，吹吹打打，引着一顶蓝轿，和一顶红缎子绣金的花轿；花轿后面跟着好些个挎盒子枪的人们，都很威武的走过去了。
    大水想：“什么人这样耍威风呀？”一打听，才知道是张金龙娶媳妇呢，娶的是大杨庄的。旁边有个抱小孩的妇女说：“不是大杨庄的，大杨庄是她姥姥家。”大水听了，心里一激灵，就问：“这家姓什么呀？”那女人说：“许是姓梁吧。”大水说：“该不是姓杨？”女人笑起来说：“那谁知道！”大水迷迷惑惑的想：“不要是杨小梅吧？”他呆呆的望着，那花轿越走越远了。
    这当儿，小梅正坐在花轿里淌眼泪呢。她早就听说，张金龙是个不正经过日子的嘎小子⑧。前两天，小梅就躺在炕上装病，用被子蒙着头，不住的啼哭；可是娘也说，姥姥也劝，临了花轿子抬来，也就由不得她了呀！
    忽然--咚！咚！咚！三声大炮。轿子落地了。
    【注】⑧嘎小子：嘎是坏的意思。
　　第二回　共产党
    星星跟月亮，
    老百姓跟共产党。
    ——民谚
    一
    小梅过了门，当了三天新媳妇，过了三天好日子。第四天，婆婆“要活”了，照老规矩，小梅给她作一条棉裤。婆婆把棉裤翻过来，掉过去，看了又看，就挑开眼了：这儿针脚大啦，那儿絮的不匀啦，刺打了几句。一过了年，小梅走姥姥家回来，就忙活开了。婆婆家人口多，小梅一天要推两回碾子，作两顿饭，还要解苇，碾苇，织一领丈二的席，她可只长着两只手呀！
    婆婆家早先原是个富户，在张金龙爷爷手里就败落了，眼下只剩一所破宅院。一家人全靠张金龙在外面讹个钱，诈个财，吃点好的，穿点好的，装装门面。他们可瞧不起“死庄稼人”，欺侮杨小梅。他们吃好的，小梅常挨饿。有一次，公公抽足了大烟，一时高兴，对小梅说：“你碾苇，拿块饽饽吃吧。”小梅刚吃一口，婆婆进来了，发话说：“好媳妇，你长着双管肠子呀？”公公说：“你叫他吃饱了好干活啊。”婆婆撇着嘴儿，不言声。小梅也吃不下了，把饽饽放进篮里就去碾苇。这小媳妇，脑后边挽了个髻儿，穿着宽宽大大的棉袄，一边拉着大石滚，一边掉眼泪。
    婆婆还象防贼似的防着小梅，米面全锁在自己的套间里，每顿作饭，都得婆婆亲手舀出来，不许小梅沾手。就连作鞋用的“夹纸”和“铺衬”，也得婆婆拿钥匙开柜取给她。小梅实在受不住窝囊气，跟她男人又说不来个话。那男人脾气大多了，老是拧眉毛，瞪眼睛。小梅在他面前，什么话也不想说，连嘴都快要生锈啦。她想找娘诉诉苦，可是娘回家了，路很远。小梅只好瞅机会，跑到姊姊家哭一顿，躲一躲。大水听到小梅这样受苦，心里很难过；可是小梅已经成了人家的人，他又有什么办法呀！
    二
    敌人在头年腊月来进攻过一次，咱们新编的队伍开到滏河边，打了三天三夜，把敌人打退了。这年春天，敌人第二次来，兵力可大多啦，有一千多人，尽是牲口拉的大炮，还有飞机掩护。这边的队伍只有三百多，在河边整整坚持了一天，就被敌人攻过来，占了县城。咱们的队伍就在农村，配合地方党，继续组织群众，发展武装………
    县上的宣传队常到申家庄来，还有“女红军”，也穿着蓝制服，打着旗子，在街上喊口号，刷标语，登台演讲。小梅有时候来姊姊家，也跟着去开会，看着那些“女红军”又会说，又会写，还不受压迫，小梅真眼热。再看牛大水，大水头上包着白手巾，身上穿着对襟的蓝褂儿，腰里缠着子弹带，肩上扛着一支大枪，也兴头头的在街上走来走去。连牛小水也参加了儿童救国会，天天上操，唱歌，很热闹。可是小梅在姐姐家住不上三天，婆婆就要打发人来找，好说歹说，怎么着也得把她叫回去。
    秋天，农会成立了。黑老蔡调在工作团，管着好几个村。大水在本村农会里也当上了干部。申耀宗在背地说：“吓！这些家伙，瞎字不识，满脑袋的高粱花子，也能干出个事儿来呀？”减租减息布置到村，他更不满意，尽在暗里使绊儿。后来，农会几百人到县上去告他，他眼看顶不住，才老实了；见了牛大水，反而笑嘻嘻的点头招呼。大水可松了一口气；他爹算一算，这几年光利钱滚去了一百挂零，人家攒着文书呢，今年再还不清，地就丢了。可是减了租，减了息，地保住了，还能有碗饭吃。喜得老爹说：“要不是闹农会，人家今年就要掐咱们的脖子啦。好小子，好好儿干吧。”大水工作更上劲了。（附图片）
    他们想抓黑老蔡，老蔡喝着说：“谁敢捆我！”  
    牛大水看呆了：“花轿里该不是杨小梅吧？”
    杨小梅一边拉着大石滚，一边掉眼泪。
