    Nankou Locomotive Depot Commemorates May Day
    Installs "Badaling" Locomotive
    [Chahar News] To welcome May Day and actively support the front lines, the Nankou Locomotive Depot repaired and installed a "Badaling" locomotive in three days. It was test-driven to Beiping on April 28th. Normally, it takes five days to repair and inspect a locomotive, but thanks to the active assistance of 25 workers including Zhang Yude from other groups, who volunteered to participate outside of their working hours, it was completed within the scheduled three days.

    南口机务段纪念五一
    装好八达岭号机车
    【察哈尔讯】为迎接五一，积极支援前线，南口机务段以三天的时间，修装了“八达岭号”机车一台，四月二十八日已试车开赴北平一次。按平时修检一台机车，必须五天，但由于其他组的张雨德等二十五名工友积极协助，自愿在自己工作时间外参加，故在预定的三天内完成了。
