Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 26th -- Under the orders of bandit chieftains Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, Shi Jue, and others, the Kuomintang bandit troops have been wantonly destroying Shanghai. The destruction orders issued by bandits Tang and Shi under the instructions of bandit Chiang have been captured by the People's Liberation Army in the battle to liberate Liuhe. In his Qing Zi No. 2045 telegram, bandit Tang ordered his subordinates: "1. All bamboo and wood within five kilometers in front of the positions and their forward positions should be cut down immediately, and the cut bamboo and wood should be moved into the positions and in front of the positions to set up obstacles. This work must be completed before May 8th; those who delay will be severely punished. 2. All railway and highway bridges within forty kilometers in front of the defense zone regiments' positions (extending forward according to the operational boundary line) should be planned immediately, and teams should be dispatched to complete the destruction preparations, awaiting orders or thoroughly destroy them according to the situation." In his Fangchao Zi No. 41 order, bandit Shi stated: "1. All tall buildings in front of the positions that can be used by the bandits (note: a derogatory term for the People's Liberation Army) for artillery observation and hinder our army's field of fire, except for special circumstances that should be reported for handling, should be thoroughly destroyed. 2. Rivers in front of the positions that can cause local flooding should be implemented immediately." In order to carry out this reactionary order, when the bandit 123rd Army, Gu Xijiu's division, fled from Jiaxing to Shanghai, they destroyed seven large iron bridges on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, including Nos. 31, 32, 33, 37, 41, 46, and the Wangdian Bridge south of Jiaxing. Before the bandit troops retreated from the suburbs of Shanghai, they wantonly destroyed all strongholds and towns, and used warships to fire incendiary bombs at villages and towns along the Yangtze River in Pudong. The largest Jiangnan Shipyard in the country was destroyed by the bandit troops, resulting in a huge explosion. The Lianjing Shipyard and Paper Mill in the Pudong urban area were also destroyed. Countless houses and rural areas in the western suburbs of Shanghai were demolished, and tens of thousands of people were homeless, fleeing to the liberated areas day and night with their families. The bandit air force continued to indiscriminately bomb towns. Luodian Town in western Shanghai was bombed continuously for several days. At 4:00 PM on the 13th, five heavy bombs fell in the Yitangxi Street area of the town alone, destroying all 25 shops and killing nine residents and injuring thirteen. At 4:00 PM on the 18th, a bandit heavy bomber bombed Liuhe, destroying more than 20 merchants and five civilian ships in the town, killing several residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 26th -- The Kuomintang bandit troops in Shanghai are carrying out frantic destruction inside and outside the city. At 8:00 AM on the 21st, a unit of bandit troops landed from a ship north of Qingningsi in Pudong at the Shangchuan Transportation Company and destroyed the Mobil Oil Factory, which was operated by American merchants, causing a fire. At 8:10 AM, another battalion of bandit troops landed from three warships south of Qingningsi, occupied Zhujiazai, and set fire to the Zhongxing Company. The arsonist bandit troops fled after being severely attacked by the People's Liberation Army. The bandit troops also carried out huge explosions in many places in Nanshi and the Gaochang Temple area. The losses are still under investigation.
