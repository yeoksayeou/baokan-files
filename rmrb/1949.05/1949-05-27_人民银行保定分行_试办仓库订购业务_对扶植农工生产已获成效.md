[Ji Zhong Electric] In order to support the development of industry and agriculture, the Baoding Office of the People's Bank of China is piloting a warehouse ordering business. In December of last year, during the agricultural slack season, the privately-owned Baoji and Xieyuan machine oil pressing factories faced difficulties in selling their finished cottonseed cake, resulting in capital turnover problems and production stagnation. The bank, adhering to the spirit of developing production and considering both public and private interests, conducted warehouse ordering for these two factories with mutual agreement. Baoji factory received five orders totaling 70,000 catties of cottonseed cake, and Xieyuan factory received two orders totaling 45,000 catties, enabling the factories to continue production. By controlling the fertilizer supply, the bank prevented speculative merchants from manipulating cake prices. Over the past four months, Baoji alone has pressed 570,000 catties of cottonseed in production, equivalent to its total annual production last year (which was 600,000 catties). The 115,000 catties of cottonseed cake purchased by the bank were directly sold to farmers by special personnel starting March 1st, after the spring plowing and sowing season began. Generally, each household received no more than 300 catties. By April 15th, all the cake had been sold. According to investigations, these fertilizers were sold to 600 farmer households in 45 villages within a 30-mile radius of Baoding City. According to cake merchants and citizens, "In previous years, every 100 catties of cake sold for up to seven dou of wheat." However, this year, under the direct control of the bank, the cake price remained below four dou of wheat for the entire 45 days. Therefore, in addition to grasping the favorable season and understanding the local and surrounding agricultural production situation, the operation of warehouse ordering must also make private capitalists profitable, combat their speculative elements, and guide them onto the right track.

　　人民银行保定分行
  　试办仓库订购业务
    对扶植农工生产已获成效
    【冀中电】为了扶植工农业的发展，中国人民银行保定办事处试办仓库订购业务。去年十二月农闲时节，私营保记、协远两机器榨油厂的棉仁饼成品不能推销，资金流转困难，生产陷于停滞状态；银行乃本发展生产、公私兼顾精神，在双方一致同意下，对该两厂进行了仓库订购。计收保记五次，共棉仁饼七万斤，协远两次，棉仁饼四万五千斤，使该两厂得以继续生产。银行掌握了肥料，就制止了投机商人操纵饼价。四个月来，只保记一家在生产中就榨棉仁五十七万斤，相当于去年的全年生产量（去年共榨六十万斤）。银行收购的十一万五千斤棉仁饼，今年开始春耕播种以后于三月一日派设了专人直接售给农民，一般每户不超过三百斤，到四月十五日全部售完。据调查这些肥料都销到保市附近三二十里地的四十五个农村的六百户农民手中去。据饼商及市民谈：“往年每百斤饼售到过七斗小麦”，但今年在银行直接掌握下整四十五天中，饼价始终活动在四斗小麦以下。因之办理仓库订购除了要掌握有利季节。了解本地及周围农业生产情况，还要使私人资本家有利可图，打击其投机成份，领导其走向正轨。
