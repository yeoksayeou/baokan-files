    Ping City Grain Company
    To Build Grain Retail Stores
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to make it more convenient for citizens to purchase grain, the Grain Branch of the Beiping Trading Company has decided to directly establish retail stores in various districts of the city. Due to the difficulty in finding shop space, four locations will be opened tomorrow (the 16th) as a temporary measure: 94 South Street at Jiaodaokou, 24 Heng Street, and 268 East-West Street in the inner three districts, and 3 Dingxiang Hutong in the inner first district. To prevent hoarding and speculation, the temporary daily purchase limit is set at no more than ten *jin* per person, and prices will be posted daily at each retail store. The grain types sold include millet flour, corn flour, *kou* millet, sorghum rice, and macaroni.

    [This Newspaper's Report] Many of the agency stores in Ping City that sell grain on behalf of the Trading Company are indeed good and have been approved by the Trading Company after review. However, there are still some agency stores that continue to violate government laws and illegally sell grain. The Third District recently discovered three such stores. The most serious case is the Xinchangtai agency store. On April 12th, it received 10,000 *jin* of northeastern corn. In addition to earning a profit of 1,055 *jin*, it mixed in its own bad corn and sold it at the store, earning an illegal profit of 1,039 yuan. On April 28th, it received 3,000 *jin* of sorghum rice and stole 600 *jin*, selling it to Tian Qingkui at 17 yuan per *jin*. It then sold it at the market price of 35 yuan. Both parties gained an illegal profit of 10,800 yuan. In addition, it falsely reported 278 *jin* of corn as sold. It either sold good grain to former puppet *bao* and *jia* heads, and bad grain to ordinary citizens. Therefore, the masses are demanding the organization of consumer cooperatives to replace agency stores. The Fifth District is preparing to establish a cooperative in each central street. The Third Street has already established one. The district is now widely carrying out propaganda work to attract workers, independent laborers, poor citizens, and public employees to buy shares.

    建粮食零售店
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司粮食分公司为使市民更便利的购买粮食，决定在本市各区直接建立零售店。现因店房筹找困难，暂先在内三区界交道口南大街九十四号、横街二十四号、东西大街二六八号，内一区界丁香胡同三号开设四处，定明日（十六日）开业。为防止囤积贩卖，暂定每人每日购买量不得超过十市斤，价格每晨在各零售店挂牌公布。所售粮种有小米面、玉米面、口小米、高粱米、通粉等。

    【本报讯】平市各区代售贸易公司粮食的代售店，确有许多好的，已经贸易公司审查合格，但仍有一些代售店，继续违犯政府法令非法盗卖。第三区最近即发现了三家。其中最严重的为信昌泰代售店，四月十二日领到东北玉米一万斤，除赚了一千零五十五斤外，再掺上自己的坏玉米在门市部出售，又获得非法利润一千零三十九元。四月二十八日又领到高粱米三千斤，盗卖六百斤，以每斤十七元卖给天庆魁。复以市价三十五元卖出。双方均沾非法利润一万零八百元。另外又多报销玉米二百七十八斤。或将好的粮食卖给过去的伪保甲长，坏的卖给一般市民。因此群众要求组织消费合作社，代替代售店。第五区准备于每一个中心街成立一个合作社。第三街已首先成立。现该区正广泛进行宣传工作，吸收各行业的工人，独立劳动者，贫苦市民和公教人员入股。    （超祺）
