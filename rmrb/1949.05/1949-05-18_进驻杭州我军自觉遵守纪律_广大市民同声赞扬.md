　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 17th: The People's Liberation Army, upon entering Hangzhou city, has demonstrated strict discipline, earning praise from the citizens. Before even entering the city, the unit conducted thorough mobilization among the troops: "Implementing policies should be regarded as equally important as winning battles." The soldiers firmly remembered the entry rules issued by the Field Political Department. When a certain regiment rapidly occupied the urban area, because the cooks had not arrived, the soldiers cooked their own meals and boiled their own water, politely declining the enthusiastic help of the landlords. At that time, the currency value had not yet been determined, so many companies temporarily refrained from buying vegetables, preferring to eat plain rice for several meals, or just rice with salted water. A squad guarding the Kuomintang's Southeast Daily newspaper and Zhejiang Radio Station ate three meals of plain rice in a row. The original staff members there offered them dishes with every meal, but were always declined. After the Liberation Army stationed in the house of a puppet village chief refused similar hospitality, the puppet village chief asked, based on his old society experience: "Are you afraid your officers will see?" The soldiers sternly replied: "Our adherence to discipline is conscious; it's the same whether the superiors are present or not." The troops guarding public places and warehouses ensured that these state properties remained intact and undamaged. Although many soldiers' shoes were broken after long-distance pursuit operations, no one touched the large quantities of shoes, socks, clothing, and daily necessities displayed in the guarded areas. The guard unit at a certain warehouse was replaced several times, but the bowl of rice, salted eggs, and cigarettes originally placed on the table remained as they were. The staff of a large hotel gave a thumbs-up and said: "It's no wonder the Kuomintang army, even if it had more than a few hundred thousand men left, was destined to be defeated; you are too good, who wouldn't support you!"

　　进驻杭州我军自觉遵守纪律
  　广大市民同声赞扬
    【新华社杭州十七日电】进驻杭州市区的解放军，纪律严明，受到市民的赞扬。该部早在入城之前，就在部队进行深入的动员：“执行政策应与争取战斗胜利同等看待”。战士们都牢牢地记住了野战政治部颁发的入城守则。某团飞速地进占市区时，因为炊事员均未赶到，战士们便自己做饭烧水，房东们的殷勤帮助均被婉言谢绝。当时币值尚未确定，许多连队便暂不买菜，宁愿好几顿都吃白饭，或仅以盐水下饭。看守国民党的东南日报社和浙江广播电台的一个班，一连吃了三顿白饭。该处原来的职员们在每顿饭时都给他们送来几个菜，但是每次都被谢绝了。驻在一个伪保长家里的解放军拒绝了同样的款待以后，该伪保长以其旧社会的经验问道：“你们怕官长看见吗？”战士们严正地回答他说：“我们遵守纪律是自觉的，上级在不在跟前都是一样。”看守公共场所和仓库的部队，保证了这些国家财产原封不动和完好无损。虽然经过长途追击作战以后，许多战士的鞋都破了，但是摆满在看守地区内的大批鞋袜衣物和日用品都没有人动它一下。某仓库的看管部队更换了几次，而原来摆在桌子上的大米饭，咸鸡蛋和香烟仍然保持着原来的样子。看守车站的部队为了不搬动车厢里的物资，宁愿在潮湿的地板上睡了几天，堆在站上和车厢里的许多棉絮、麻袋都无人动用。一个大饭店的店员翘起大姆指说：“不讲国民党军队只剩下几十万人，再多也是要败的，你们太好了，谁不拥护呢！”
