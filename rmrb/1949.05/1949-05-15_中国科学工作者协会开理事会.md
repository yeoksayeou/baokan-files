    [Ping City News] Of the current council members of the Chinese Scientific Workers Association, Yan Jici, Zeng Zhaolun, Huang Guozhang, Yuan Hansheng, and Qian Sanqiang were originally in Ping. After the liberation of Beiping, Lu Yuda, Ding Zan, and Zhou Jianren came to Ping. In order to promote the work of the association, a temporary organization, the "Joint Association of 理监事 of the Chinese Scientific Workers Association in Ping," was established. Now, three more council members have arrived in Ping, bringing the total number of council members in Ping to two-thirds of the total number of fifteen. Therefore, a formal council meeting was held the day before yesterday, and the work of the association can now be officially carried out in Ping.
    The council meeting passed a resolution to establish a temporary standing council (which, according to the regulations, must be elected by all council members through correspondence), and elected Liang Xi, Tu Changwang, Lu Yuda, Yan Jici, Yuan Hanqing, Ding Zan, and Pan Shu as standing council members. Liang Xi was elected as Chairman of the Council, and Tu Changwang as Secretary-General. It was also decided that the National Congress, which should be held in the autumn of this year, will be held in Beiping.
    The central tasks of the Chinese Scientific Workers Association in the future will be to mobilize scientific workers across the country to strengthen unity, intensify investigation and research and self-education, and make the greatest efforts to realize Chairman Mao's call for increased production and to build a new China.
