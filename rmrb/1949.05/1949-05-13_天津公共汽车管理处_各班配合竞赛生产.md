Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 11th. After the Tianjin Public Bus Management Office launched a work competition, the production enthusiasm and work efficiency of the staff have significantly improved. When the idea of a work competition was first proposed, some workers felt that not being lazy was enough, and competition was unnecessary; some even believed that competition would cause "conflicts" between work teams. However, most workers agreed with the competition, believing that it could show the merits of good performance and correct the faults of some lazy people. The competition movement started with the major repair team and then promoted the implementation of other work teams. To avoid mutual interference, it was stipulated that everyone should strive to cooperate. Whoever delays work will be responsible. For example, after the major repair team inspects the vehicles to be repaired, proposes the degree of damage, the materials required for repair, and the repair plan, other work teams and the materials section immediately formulate a plan for cooperation. Repairmen in the minor repair team, field drivers, and conductors also implemented a group responsibility system for contracted vehicles, with each group competing with each other. When a minor problem occurred with a vehicle, drivers and conductors would automatically help repair it, rather than blaming each other as they did before liberation. The time it took for vehicles to depart from the garage (from the first vehicle leaving the depot to the last one being ready) at the Hexi Automobile Factory under the management office was 50 minutes before liberation, but after the competition was launched, it only took 10 minutes. The Hebei Repair Shop's plan to overhaul eight engine heads in April was also completed ahead of schedule on April 26th. The newspaper communication organization that developed during the competition has continuously praised active workers, which has also played a significant role in promoting the competition.

    各班配合竞赛生产
    【新华社天津十一日电】天津公共汽车管理处开展工作竞赛后，职工生产积极性与工作效率显著提高。工作竞赛的意见初提出时，有的工人觉得自己不偷懒就算啦，竞赛是多余的；有的甚至认为竞赛会引起各工班的“矛盾”。但大多数工人都赞成竞赛，认为这样可以显出成绩好坏，同时可使一些偷懒的人改正毛病。竞赛运动由大修班首先开始，进而推动各工班相继实行。为避免各班互相影响工作，规定要努力配合。谁误了工作谁负责。如大修班检查了应修车辆，提子的出车破损程度、修理所需材料及修理计划后，其他工班及材料股便立刻作出配合的计划。小修班修理工、外勤司机与售票员还实行了分组负责包车制，各组互相开展竞赛。车子出了小毛病，司机与售票员也自动帮忙修理，而不是象解放前那样彼此互相埋怨。管理处所属河西汽车厂的出车时间（从第一辆出库到最后出齐），解放前需五十分钟，展开竞赛后只用十分钟。河北修车厂四月份大修八辆车头的计划，亦在四月二十六日提前完成。在竞赛中发展起来的报纸通讯组织，曾对积极工人不断予以表扬，在推动竞赛上亦起了相当作用。
