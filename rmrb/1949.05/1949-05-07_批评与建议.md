Criticism and Suggestions
    The newspaper should be delivered continuously. To the Editorial Comrades:
    Since the newspaper office moved to Beiping, it has been difficult to see the newspaper in a timely manner. On April 25th, I only saw the April 7th newspaper. Due to the long distance, it is not surprising. However, it often happens that I don't see it for several days, and then receive three issues on one day. Is this a distribution problem? Or is it a postal delivery problem? I hope you can investigate the cause and improve it, so that it can be delivered on time and continuously.
  　Do not wear military uniforms indiscriminately
    Recently, in Shipang, Fuping, there have been two people wearing military uniforms living in the homes of ordinary people, with unknown origins, eating and drinking excessively. The masses are suspicious but dare not ask. In Nanyu Village, five people in uniforms were found impersonating Fuping electrical wire inspectors. Their behavior was suspicious, but because the masses could not distinguish between real and fake, they were not questioned, and later disappeared. During this period, electrical wires were found to be damaged near the Shuiyu Shentai. We suggest: non-military personnel should not be allowed to wear military uniforms; cadres should be issued badges by the government and should carry credentials when traveling far; merchants should have business licenses when traveling far; and local authorities should be responsible for carefully questioning people with suspicious behavior. (Luo Fengwen, Li Kedong)
    Hoping the Shijiazhuang Post Office will deliver newspapers in a timely manner
    Since our troops entered the Taiyuan area, the People's Daily has arrived very irregularly and has been interrupted twice. According to the investigation, the first time it was delayed in Zhuolu due to transportation problems. The second time, we did not see the newspaper for nine days. We sent people to investigate and found that eleven issues had been accumulated when it was delivered from the Shijiazhuang Post Office ten days later. According to the Shijiazhuang Post Office, "The Zhengtai Railway is busy with military transportation and was delayed for three days." But it shouldn't be delayed for so long! The local newspapers arrive very normally, so why can't the newspapers for the troops be delivered in a timely manner? I hope the Shijiazhuang Post Office will check and ensure that there is no accumulation in the future and that they are delivered in a timely manner to ensure that the front lines can see the newspaper regularly.

    Suggestions to the People's Government to Strengthen Infant Care Editorial Comrades:
    The infant mortality rate in our country is very high. In order to build a new China, reducing infant mortality is an urgent task. I have the following suggestions:
    1. Please ask the Health Department of the North China People's Government to introduce more knowledge of maternal and child health, proper methods of childcare, and methods of management and care for young children in newspapers or by other means.
    2. Please ask the North China People's Government to order the health departments and public hospitals of all levels of government to transform the old-style midwives, eliminate their bad obstetric practices, and conduct more scientific midwifery training to reduce infant mortality. (Zhang Zhiping, Handan)

### 批评与建议

专栏：批评与建议

　　批评与建议
　  报纸应连续传递编辑同志：
    自报社移至北平后，报纸即不能及时看到，四月二十五日，才见到四月七日的报纸，因路途遥远尚不足为奇，但常有数日不见，一日即接三张之事。这是发行问题呢？还是邮局传递问题呢？望能追查原因，予以改进，达到按期连续传递。
  　不要乱着军服
    阜平石坊近日有两个身着军服的人住在老百姓家里，不明来历，大吃大喝；群众怀疑但亦不敢过问。在南峪村发现五个身着制服的人，冒充阜平检查电线的工作员，形迹可疑，但因群众真假难辨，亦未盘询，后不见踪。就在这期间水峪神台间发现电线被破坏。我们建议：非军人一律不准着军服，干部统由政府发一证章，远出应带有证明信件，商人远出应有营业证，地方上对行迹可疑的人，要负责慎重盘询。（罗凤文、李克东）
    希石家庄邮局及时运送报纸
    我部队自进入太原地区后，人民日报来得很不经常，并中断过两次。据查第一次是涿鹿因运输问题积压了，第二次九天没看到报纸，我们派人去查，十日才从石家庄邮局运来共积压了十一期的报纸。据石家庄邮局谈：“正太路忙于军运，压了三天”。但也不能压这样多呀！地方上的报纸却来的很正常，为什么部队上的报纸不能及时运送呢？希望石家庄邮局检查今后不要积压，及时运送，保证前方经常看到报纸。（十九兵团军邮办事处）
    建议人民政府加强婴儿保育工作编辑同志：
    我国婴儿的死亡率很大，为了建设新中国，减少婴儿的死亡率是当前急务，对此我有以下建议：
    一、请华北人民政府卫生部在报上或用其他办法多介绍些妇婴卫生常识、育儿妥善办法，及对幼童的管理保育方法。
    二、请华北人民政府通令所属各级政府的卫生部门和公立医院，对旧收生婆予以改造，革除其旧收生的恶劣手术，进行较科学的助产训练，以减少婴儿的死亡率。（邯郸张治平）
