Young China’s future unfolded in a magnificent vista at the First National Youth Congress. For thousands of years, ancient China had consistently suffered from the corruption and devastation of evil forces. After years of arduous struggle, it has now truly gained new vitality, and this vigorous new life is concentrated in each youth representative present.

These are all good sons and daughters of the Chinese people to be proud of. From the front lines, from factories, from rural areas, from schools, from the Kuomintang-controlled areas heavily blockaded, and even from Taiwan and Southeast Asia separated by vast oceans, they have traveled with the entrustment of millions of young people to present the fruits of their past struggles to the congress and to obtain their future struggle goals.

At that moment, when Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army appeared on the stage, every youthful heart was like a group of stars orbiting the sun, momentarily radiating brighter light and greater heat.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu stood in front of the evergreen palm trees, with the blooming potted flowers reflecting his kind and firm demeanor, as if he were the embodiment of young China. After a burst of thunderous applause, he spoke calmly:

“...For thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party has established an inseparable bond with the Chinese workers, peasants, youth, and revolutionary intellectual youth. Thirty years of history have proven that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the revolutionary youth of China will surely be able to unleash its greatest revolutionary power...”

And this tremendous power, once unleashed, has bloomed countless revolutionary flowers all over the land of China. Look, isn't that the youth hero Li Guangzheng, his chest full of medals? He had performed one special service and four major services in Siping, Western Liaoning, Jinzhou, and Tianjin. In Tianjin, in order to completely and thoroughly annihilate the enemy, he single-handedly defeated nine of the enemy's desperate counter-attacks. Here is also the nineteen-year-old special-class hero Ma Shaokong, who was wounded three times but remained on the front line during the annihilation of Huang Wei's corps on the Huaihai front. In tireless continuous operations, he achieved three special merits in a row. His ruddy, young face shows the unique perseverance of the Chinese people.

In the rear's production and construction, the workers are not lagging behind either. Dong Ruizhou, a young worker at the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, during the enemy's indiscriminate bombing in the summer of 1948, defended against air raids during the day and worked at night, month after month, without reducing production at all.

The historical miracles created by the peasants in the liberated areas are even more astonishing. They not only powerfully shattered the feudal forces in the countryside, but also fought the enemy head-on. Shi Zhenyu, a laboring woman from Linshu, Shandong, under the cruel attacks of the Kuomintang reactionaries, in wind and rain, summer and winter, laid mines and cut electric wires, going through 92 battles and victoriously persisting for 18 months. Kong Linglun, a liberated peasant from Fugou, Henan, received land as a family, eagerly carried stretchers, fought in Xuchang, marched in Huaihai, and even took off his cotton clothes and trousers to cover the wounded. As for himself? He said to people: "I am an iron man, I can't freeze to death!"

At the same time, the youth in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also demonstrated a spirit of heroic and unyielding struggle. In January 1948, workers at the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Mill, demanding wage increases, fought hand-to-hand against more than 5,000 military police and cavalry using machine guns, armored vehicles, tanks, and tear gas. Some workers died, were injured, or were arrested, but they remained unyielding to the death. At this meeting, there was a young female worker who personally participated in this fight.

It is these people, and many others like them, who inherited the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people in their struggle for freedom and democracy, and united with revolutionary intellectuals, advancing wave upon wave, fighting incessantly, and finally defeated the reactionary forces, declaring the death of old China and the birth of new China.

However, young China will never stop here, it must move forward forever like the Youth locomotive. And every young master of the new China will surely, like Zhang Chenjiu, a young worker in Northeast China, unite the broad masses to transform a dilapidated locomotive like the old China into a brand new one, growing and strengthening together with the youth. They will definitely do this. Their determination, their vows, are already written on bright red banners, presented on the spot to their leaders Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

The banner of the South China People's Guerrilla reads: "We will resolutely carry out your orders, cooperate with you, and complete the final victorious battle!"

The banner of the Northeast Youth Representatives reads: "We will always be under your leadership, and do our best for the cause of building a new China!"

Flowers will wither, youth will fade away, but the youth of new China will forever be displayed in human history, eternally immortal.

    青年中国
    ——全国青年第一次代表大会速写
    杨朔
    新中国的青春在全国第一次青年代表大会上展开了一幅灿烂的远景。几千年来古老的中国，一贯受着恶势力的腐蚀蹂躏，经过多少年的艰苦斗争，现时才真正得到了新生的活力，而这朝气蓬勃的新生正集中表现在到会的每个青年代表身上。
    他们都是中国人民值得骄傲的好儿女，从火线，从工厂，从农村，从学校，从封锁重重的国民党统治区，更从间隔重洋的台湾和南洋，负着千千万万青年的嘱托，跋涉而来，向大会捧献了他们过去斗争的果实，也将取得他们未来的斗争目标。
    在那一刻，当中国人民解放军朱总司令出现在台前，每颗青春的心都象围绕着太阳的星群，一时发挥出更亮的光，更大的热。
    朱总司令站在长青的棕榈树前，盛开的盆花映着他慈祥而坚毅的丰采，仿佛正是青年中国的化身。他在一阵暴雨似的掌声后，从从容容地讲话：
    “……三十年来，中国共产党与中国的工农青年和革命知识青年建立了血肉不可分的联系，三十年的历史证明，中国革命青年在中国共产党的领导之下，就一定能发挥它最大的革命力量。……”
    而这发挥起来的巨大力量，早在中国的土地上开遍无数枝革命的花朵。看吧，那不是青年英雄李广正，胸前挂满勋章。他曾经在四平、辽西、锦州、天津立过一次特功，四次大功。在天津，为了要干净彻底地歼灭敌人，他一个人曾击溃了敌人九次垂死的反突。这里更有十九岁的特等英雄马绍孔，在淮海前线歼灭黄维兵团时，三次负伤不下火线，在不怕疲劳的连续作战中，一连建立三个特功。他的红朴朴的年青的脸上，正表现了中国人民特有的坚忍精神。
    在后方生产建设上，工人更不落后。石家庄炼焦厂的青工董瑞州就曾在一九四八年夏天敌机滥炸下，白天防空，黑夜做活，几个月几个月干，生产一点也不减少。
    解放区农民所创造的历史奇迹更是惊人。他们不但有力地粉碎了农村的封建势力，更与敌人做了正面的斗争。山东临沭的劳动妇女侍振玉就在国民党反动派的残酷进攻下，五冬六夏，风里雨里，埋地雷，割电线，前后经过九十二次战斗，胜利地坚持了十八个月。河南扶沟的翻身农民孔令伦，家庭分到土地，抢着出担架，打许昌，走淮海，棉衣棉裤都脱给伤员盖，他自己呢？他对人说：“我是个铁人，冻不死！”
    同时，在国民党统治区的青年们照样表现了英勇不屈的战斗精神。一九四八年一月上海申新纱厂要求增资的工人曾经赤手空拳，跟使用机关枪、铁甲车、坦克车、催泪弹的五千多名军警马队，做着生死的肉搏。工人有的死了，伤了，被捕了，但他们始终是宁死不屈。在这个会上，就有一位亲身参加了这次搏斗的青年女工。
    就是这些人，以及许许多多这样的人，继承着中国人民争自由争民主的革命精神，和革命的知识分子结成一体，前仆后继，战斗不息，最终击败了反动势力，宣告了旧中国的死亡，新中国的诞生。
    但是，青年中国决不会就此停顿，一定要象青年号机车那样永远前进。而新中国的每个青年主人也定会象东北青工张成九一样，联合广大力量，把一个象旧中国一样破旧的机车重新修造成崭新的东西，与青年共同成长，共同壮大。他们定要这样作。他们的决心，他们的誓词，早写在鲜红的锦旗上，当场献给了自己的领袖毛主席和朱总司令。
    华南人民游击队的旗上写着：“我们坚决执行您的命令，配合你们，完成最后胜利一战！”
    东北青年代表的旗上写着：“我们永远在你的领导下，为建设新中国的事业来尽最大的努力！”
    花朵会谢，青春会逝去，新中国的青春却将永远展现在人类的历史上，万古不朽。
