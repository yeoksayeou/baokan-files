    Telecommunications Bureau Inventory Work
    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Communications Group

    Beijing has been liberated, and the enterprise of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has returned to the embrace of the people!

    On the morning of March 2nd, on the road outside Hepingmen, many workers, staff, men and women, walked with smiles into the auditorium of the Teachers College Affiliated High School. They were the employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, here to attend the general staff meeting.

    At the staff meeting, the military control representative explained the meaning and purpose of the inventory and announced that inventory committee members would be elected democratically by region to carry out the bureau's inventory work. The election principles were: (1) elect those who are fair and responsible to the people; (2) elect those who are familiar with the situation; (3) the original section chiefs and above in management positions, because they are responsible for handover, do not have the right to be elected, but have the right to vote. The military control committee liaisons from each unit presided over the elections in their respective regional units. On the way from the meeting, everyone was excitedly considering their election candidates. The next day, after a day of heated discussion and campaigning, under the principle of democratic election, inventory committee members from twelve units were elected. On the night of the 3rd, a meeting was held. In addition to the seven representatives from the military control representative group, two people from the Workers Preparatory Committee also participated, totaling twenty-one people. At the meeting, the organization of the entire inventory committee was decided, with a director, a secretary, and two groups: Group One, the Material Group; Group Two, the Administrative Group.

    To facilitate the inventory work, a collective living arrangement was adopted. On the 4th, the committee members returned to their respective units to temporarily hand over their duties, and all reported and moved into the South Bureau residence on the 5th. In the afternoon of the 5th, group discussions were held to determine the work steps and methods. Steps: First, preparation work, group discussions, and formulation of an inventory plan; research of existing handover registers, investigation, and understanding of all parties' situations, and hiring of staff to assist. Second, conduct the inventory, with groups departing to each unit to inventory materials and listen to the original management personnel's general situation introductions. Third, organize the materials, collect inventory data, and conduct statistical research and summarization. Methods: First, material inventory, determined to be conducted according to the situation, with major items undergoing detailed investigation, secondary items undergoing sampling inspection, waste materials undergoing inspection, omissions undergoing supplementary inspection, unclear items undergoing re-inspection, and problems undergoing tracing. Second, understanding the situation, the following methods were used in conjunction with the material inventory: The original management personnel made work reports and general situation introductions, then the inventory group raised questions, which were answered in writing, and individual investigations and conversations were conducted during the inventory, and opinions from all staff were listened to, and materials were researched and archives were analyzed.

    On the 7th, the inventory work officially began in groups, and on the 23rd, the inventory of materials and listening to the original management personnel's situation introductions were completed, taking a full seventeen days. Nearly a month and a half was spent on organizing, statistically compiling, and summarizing the work, and the inventory work was officially concluded.

    The results of the inventory revealed discrepancies with the originally reported numbers, discrepancies with the supplemented numbers, and many unreported materials. Main equipment: eighty-six items did not match the original reported numbers; seven hundred and fifty-eight items were supplemented; four hundred and fifty-two items were unreported. Among them were 5KW transmitters, telephone exchanges, batches of new storage batteries, copper wire, cables, batches of telephones, diesel, gasoline, and more than three thousand signal lamps, etc. Materials: Regarding furniture, sundries, bedding textiles, and equipment, the difference between the original reported numbers and the verified numbers was staggering. For example, the originally reported number of furniture was six thousand five hundred and forty-seven pieces, while the verified number was eight thousand four hundred and seventy pieces. The originally reported number of sundries was thirty pieces, while the verified number was five thousand four hundred and forty-nine pieces, etc. Other unreported numbers, such as fixed and movable equipment and stationery, were also very alarming. Furthermore, many usable or repairable equipment were found in the waste products, such as one thousand seven hundred telephones found in the waste products, most of which could be used after repair. On April 18th, Wang, the director of the inventory committee (military control representative), made a detailed inventory summary report at the general staff meeting.

    Through this inventory work, we have learned that the previous telecommunications agency was bureaucratic, irresponsible, and wasteful. During the three years of Kuomintang rule, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau had no construction and focused on formal displays. Their perfunctory bureaucracy was extreme. In the management of materials, they were indifferent, allowing them to be eroded by rain, blown by wind, and exposed to the sun. Waste was everywhere. Private borrowing of public property was rampant, with some people individually borrowing more than two hundred items of materials. In terms of personnel, everything was based on people, and arrangements were made based on people. This is the characteristic of the entire Kuomintang bureaucratic structure.

    电信局的清点工作
    北平电信局通讯组
    北平解放了，北平电信局企业机构也回到人民的怀抱了！
    三月二日上午，在和平门外的马路上，走着许多有工人、职员，男男女女都喜笑颜开地走进了师大附中的礼堂。他们就是北平电信局的职工，是来参加全体员工大会的。
    职工大会会上，军管代表说明清点之意义及目的，并宣布按地区依民主方式，选举清点委员，进行本局的清点工作。选举原则是：（一）选举办事公正为人民负责的；（二）选举熟悉情况的；（三）原科长以上的主管人员，因要负责点交，无被选权，但有选举权。由各单位的军管会连络员，主持各该地区单位的选举。散会的路上，每个人都兴高彩烈地酝酿着选举对象。第二天经过了一天的热烈讨论与进行竞选，于民主选举的原则下，十二个单位的清点委员产生了。在三日的夜晚开了一次会，除军管代表组七人参加外，工筹会也参加了两个人，共计人数为二十一人，在会上决定了整个清点委员会的组织，设主任委员，下设秘书及两个小组，第一组机材组，第二组行政组。
    为了清点工作进行便利，采取了集体生活，四日委员们回到各自单位，办理自己职务上暂时的交代，均于五日报到并迁入南局居住。在五日下午，分组开了讨论会，确定了工作步骤和方法。步骤：第一准备工作，分组讨论，并制定清点计划，研究现有移交清册，调查与了解各方情况并且聘请干事协助。第二进行清点，分组出发至各单位清点物资与听取原主管人员一般的情况介绍。第三整理材料，汇集清点资料，进行统计研究总结。方法方面：第一物资清点，确定按照情况分为主要者进行详查，次要者进行抽查，废料物进行检查，遗漏者进行补查，查而不清楚者进行复查，发现问题者进行追查。第二了解情况，为配合物资的清点，进行了下列方法：由原主管人员进行工作报告及一般情况介绍，然后由清点小组提出问题，再书面解答，并于清点时进行个别调查与谈话，并听取各方职工的意见，研究材料与分析档案。
    七日清点工作正式分组进行，于二十三日完成了清点物资与听取原主管人员的情况介绍，共用了整整十七天的时间，在整理和统计汇集工作用了将近一个半月的时间，清点工作才正式结束。
    清点的结果，发现了与原报数不符，补报数也不符，漏报的物资还很多。主要器材：与原报数不符者计八十六件；补报数七百五十八件；漏报数四百五十二件。其中有５ＫＷ发报机，电话交换机，成批新的蓄电瓶、铜线、电缆，成批的电话机，柴油、汽油、及三千多支讯号灯等等。物资：关于家具、杂品、被服织物及设备等，原报数与查实数的相差额可惊人了。如家具原报数六千五百四十七件，查实数八千四百七十件。杂品原报数三十件，查实数五千四百四十九件等。其他如固定及可动设备及文具漏报数都非常惊人。再者在废品中发现了很多可用或加修理可用的器材，如在废品中找出一千七百部电话机，加以修理，大部分可用。四月十八日，清点委员会王主任（军管代表）在全体职工大会上，作了详细清点总结报告。
    经过了此次的清点工作，使我们知道了以往的电信机构是官僚的、不负责的、浪费的。在国民党统治时期的三年来，北平电信局并无建设，而着重于形式摆设。其敷衍塞责的官僚气真到极点。物资的保管上，漠不关心，任其雨蚀、风吹、日晒，其浪费的情形，也到处可见。私人借用公物，竟有的人单独借用物资达二百余件之多。人事方面，多是因人对事，因人设施，这就是整个国民党一套官僚机构的特征。
