    More Wind, Less Rain: Digging Canals and Repairing Waterwheels, Zhengding Waters Wheat for the Second Time
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] This spring has seen more wind and less rain. Zhengding is intensifying its wheat irrigation efforts. The entire county has now universally watered the wheat twice and is currently irrigating it for the third time. The villages in the East Lishuang District have mostly watered the wheat three times. Last year, villages such as Wanmin Village in that district forcibly organized all of the village's waterwheels, with each wheel being used jointly by an average of fourteen or fifteen households. However, they only managed the use of the wheels without considering their preservation, and without providing any compensation to the waterwheel owners. Consequently, the owners felt that the wheels were no longer their own to command and were unwilling to repair them when they were damaged. To overcome these problems, the district helped convene a meeting for both parties to conduct self-criticisms. Afterward, they were completely reorganized on a voluntary basis, with the waterwheel owners serving as team leaders whenever possible. Each household prepaid three jin of millet per mu as a repair fee (with delayed payment for those with particular difficulties). Whoever uses the waterwheel is responsible for its safekeeping, and the user households compensated the waterwheel owners for the losses they incurred last year based on the number of mu. This way, they quickly organized themselves. The villages near the Ping'an Village District are the most severely affected by the drought in the entire county. Some impoverished households are eating bran and wild herbs, and production faces great difficulties. Under the leadership and relief efforts of the People's Government, the "Liberation Canal," measuring 4,575 zhang in length and 1 to 3 zhang in width, was built in thirty days. In addition, seventy-two small branch canals were built, measuring over 12,100 zhang in length, capable of irrigating 7,100 mu of land. Besides converting 4,400 mu of dry land into paddy fields, it also replaced seventy-six waterwheels, resolving the difficulty of lacking animal power. The wheat in Zhoujiazhuang and six other villages that benefited from this has now been watered once. Seeing the prospect of a good wheat harvest, the peasants are filled with confidence. Duxianzhuang is a small station on the Shide Railway. Most of the men work on the railway or in factories. The entire village has only thirty-seven young and able-bodied men, and women mostly take on the tasks of pulling carts, changing the water flow, and guarding the waterwheels. Most of the wheat, which accounts for one-half of the village's total acreage, has now been watered three times. Progress has also been made in repairing waterwheels during the wheat irrigation efforts. According to statistics from ten villages, ninety-seven waterwheels have been repaired. Six villages have repaired twenty-nine wells and dug eight new ones. Beizhaiying Village alone repaired nineteen waterwheels and bought three new ones, automatically organizing into three groups. Some districts have begun to pay attention to the guarding of waterwheels. Currently, in villages such as Zhuangxi in the Sixth District, cadres and militiamen have organized themselves to take turns guarding the waterwheels, avoiding the trouble of repairing waterwheels every day. Therefore, the entire county has now begun to shift to a large-scale, intensive cotton planting phase.
    The most pressing issue currently is the safekeeping of waterwheels. Some hooligans and bad elements, neglecting their duties and disrupting production, such as in Dongzhuang in the Sixth District, lost the axles of four waterwheels in one day. Other villages are constantly losing water buckets, wheel supports, etc. The masses hang them up during the day and take them back at night, which is time-consuming and laborious, greatly affecting production. This problem must be addressed. In addition, the inability of those lacking labor, especially the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, to irrigate wheat should also continue to be resolved. (Yao Fu)

### 风多雨少挖渠修车  正定麦浇二水

    风多雨少挖渠修车
    正定麦浇二水
    【本报讯】今春风多雨少，正定抓紧浇麦，现全县已普遍上过二水，正在浇第三遍。东里双区各村已大部浇过三水。去年该区完民庄等村，将全村水车强迫编制起来，每辆平均十四五户伙用，但只管使用不管保存，更不给水车户任何报酬，因之车户认为车已不属自己调用，损坏了就不愿再去修理。为克服以上毛病，由区帮助召开会议，双方进行检讨，然后，完全在自愿原则下组合，尽可能由水车户担任组长，每户按每亩预交小米三斤，作为修理费（特别困难者缓交），谁使谁负责保管，并且将去年使水车受的损失，由使用户按亩数补偿，这样很快组织起来了。平安村区附近村庄是全县灾情最严重的地方，部分贫苦户吃糠咽菜，生产有很大困难，在人民政府领导救济下，三十天工夫，一道长达四千五百七十五丈，宽一至三丈的“解放渠”建筑起来了，另有小支渠七十二道，长一万二千一百余丈，可浇地七千一百亩。除变旱田为水田四千四百余亩外，并代替水车七十六辆，解决了缺乏畜力的困难。周家庄等七个益受村小麦现已上过一水。农民们看到麦收有望，充满了信心。杜贤庄是石德路一小站，男人多到铁路、工厂作工，全村不过三十七个青壮年，拉车、改水、看车等任务，多由妇女担任。占全村总亩数二分之一的小麦，现已大部上了三水。在浇麦中水车增修亦有成绩。据十个村统计，修水车九十七辆。六个村修水井二十九眼，打新井八眼。北翟营一村修理水车十九辆，新买了三辆，自动组织三组。有的区在看管水车上已开始注意。现六的区庄西等村，由干部民兵组织起来轮流看管，避免了每天修水车的麻烦。因此目前全县已开始转入大量突击植棉阶段。
    当前最迫切是水车保管问题，有些流氓坏分子，不务正业破坏生产，如六区东庄，一天丢了四辆水车的轴，其他村不断丢水斗、车脚等。群众白天挂上晚上摘回，费时费力影响生产很大。这一问题必须注意解决。另外，缺乏劳力者特别是烈军干属无法浇麦，亦应继续解决。  （药夫）
