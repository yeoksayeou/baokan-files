    Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of the Yangtze River, 29th: The Danyang People's Guerrilla Force, which persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for three years, victoriously joined forces with a certain assault battalion of the People's Liberation Army that crossed the river southward in Danyang County. At the grand reunion celebration, both sides were extremely excited. The commanders and fighters of the assault battalion greatly admired the arduous struggle and flexible fighting methods of the brotherly guerrilla force. Deputy Battalion Commander Wu Jian said: "You are like a sharp knife inserted into the enemy's heart. Our rapid and victorious crossing of the river this time is inseparable from your active cooperation." All the commanders and fighters stood up together and warmly saluted the guerrilla comrades, with continuous applause throughout the venue. Everyone shouted, "Learn from the comrades of the People's Guerrilla Force." After the guerrilla comrades spoke about the enemy's cruel "encirclement and suppression" and the heroic struggle of the people, they said excitedly: "The people of Jiangnan have really been looking forward to your arrival. The people often ask us with tears in their eyes: When will our Jiangbei troops come over?" The commanders and fighters of the assault battalion were moved and expressed that they must resolutely pursue and annihilate the Kuomintang bandit troops, fight to Guangdong, fight to Taiwan, to repay the ardent expectations of the people of Jiangnan.
