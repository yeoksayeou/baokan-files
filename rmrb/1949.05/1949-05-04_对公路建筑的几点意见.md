　　A Few Suggestions on Highway Construction
    In the entire transportation construction, highway construction occupies a very important position. Recently, in the highway construction work of Taihang First District, there are still some problems that need to be studied and resolved.
    First is the issue of technical guidance and engineering design: When highways pass through rivers, many bridges need to be built, but due to the lack of technical engineering personnel, it is very difficult for the masses to build them themselves. The Fengcun Bridge in Lincheng was once repaired by the Highway Bureau, but it was not easy for cars to pass through. This spring, the masses were asked to rebuild it. During the reconstruction, the Special Commissioner's Office contacted the Highway Bureau and requested that technical engineering personnel be sent to be responsible for planning, surveying, and guidance. However, due to the Highway Bureau's shortage of personnel and pressing work, they could not send anyone. Because of the urgency of time, the masses started to repair it themselves. After the Highway Bureau inspected it, they said it was still not good and could not carry heavy loads, so it was repaired for the third time. The Huaihe Bridge in Gaoyi was also repaired twice, wasting manpower and money. Cadres and people in Fengcun said: "Repair it! The government has plenty of money and labor." This is a serious criticism of us.
    Secondly, there are the issues of leadership and division of labor in highway construction: The Special Commissioner's Office and the cooperative sections of each county government have only three or four people, managing agricultural and sideline production, mutual aid, cooperation, water conservancy, transportation, agriculture and forestry, and other work, and cannot spare full-time personnel to manage highway construction for a long time. However, the Highway Bureau requires the government to handle everything. We feel that the Highway Bureau and the government should have a reasonable division of labor.
    Thirdly, there is the issue of the work of road maintenance workers: According to what we have seen, road maintenance personnel only care about carrying some soil and filling some small pits, they don't pick up the large stones on the road, and many of them dig soil nearby, digging up the wheat fields of the masses. A section of the highway in Neiqiu had two small ditches pressed into the road surface by cars, and the road maintenance section found the government and requested to send laborers to repair it (which was stopped by the Special Commissioner's Office). Also, there is a section of river滩 south of Dingmu Village in Neiqiu, and after the masses filled it with soil, there are still many stones on the nearby road surface. The road maintenance workers said that picking up stones is not their responsibility. These situations make the masses very dissatisfied.
    In order to build highways better, we believe that the Highway Bureau should conduct detailed inspections section by section to determine a comprehensive construction plan. If they only deal with things temporarily, conflicts will arise between the busy farming season and the production of the masses.
    In addition, the scope of work of road maintenance workers should be clearly defined, and those who violate the interests of the masses should be educated and criticized.

　　对公路建筑的几点意见
    在整个交通建设上，公路的建设占着十分重要的地位，最近在太行一分区建设公路工作中，还存在着一些问题须研究解决。
    首先是技术指导与工程设计问题：公路通过河流，有不少桥梁需要建筑，但因技术工程人员缺乏，让群众自己架设就十分困难。临城冯村桥，曾是公路局负责修过的，但汽车不易通过，今春又让群众重修。在重修时专署与公路局联络，要求派技术工程人员负责计划，测量和指导。但因公路局人少，工作忙迫，不能来人，因时间紧迫，于是群众便自己修起来，经公路局检查说仍然不行，还不能载重，于是又修了第三次。高邑槐河桥也是修了两次，劳民伤财。冯村干部和群众说：“修吧！公家有的是钱和工。”这对我们是一种严重的批评。
    其次是修公路中的领导与分工问题：专署和各县政府合作科只有三或四个人，管理农副业生产、互助、合作、水利、交通、农林等工作，不能长期的抽出专人去管理修公路问题。但公路局又是一切事情都要政府办理，我们觉得公路局与政府应有合理分工。
    再次养路员的工作问题：根据我们所见到的，养路人员只管担一点土、垫些小坑凹处，路上的大石头他们也不拣、还有不少就近起土，把群众的麦苗地挖了。内邱一段公路因汽车把路面上压了两个小沟，养路段就找到政府要求派民工修理（后经专署制止没有动用民工）。还有内邱的丁墓村南有一段河滩，群众垫土后，附近路面上还有不少石头。养路工人就说拾石头不是他们的责任，这些情况都使群众很不满意的。
    为了把公路修的更好些，我们认为公路局应按段详细检查确定全盘的修筑计划，如果临时应付，农忙起来和群众的生产就要发生矛盾。
    另外要明确规定养路工人的工作范围，对某些违犯群众利益的人员，应进行教育与批评。
