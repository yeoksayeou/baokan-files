    Ji Dian Ping Branch Company Saves Electricity
    Abolishes Electric Furnace Control, Uses Large Pots to Boil Water and Heat Food
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the Beiping branch of the Jibei Electric Power Company proposed suggestions for saving electricity, it has begun to save electricity internally. Originally, each department of the company shared more than 30 electric furnaces of 1,000 or 1,500 watts, most of which were used for boiling water and heating food, consuming at least 250 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. It is now planned to replace electric furnaces with boilers, and a large boiler has been made at the Shijingshan Power Plant, which will save a lot of electricity. In addition, the power supply department will soon reorganize the internal lines of the branch company, install electricity meters for each work unit, and stipulate the maximum electricity consumption for each, and conduct monthly electricity consumption statistics, which will also facilitate the monthly evaluation of whether each unit's electricity consumption is wasteful. In addition, the company internally found the phenomenon of street lights being on during the day, so it is planned to set up a main switch, which will be controlled by a dedicated person, which can also save a lot of electricity.

    冀电平分公司节约电力
    取销电炉管制用电支起大锅烧水热饭
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司提出节约用电建议后，已在自己内部开始节约用电。原来该公司各部共用一千或一千五百瓦之电炉三十余个，大部用于烧水和热饭，每日最少用电二百五十度。现拟用锅炉代替电炉，并已在石景山发电所做一大锅炉，这样即可节省很多电力。另外，供电课很快即整理分公司内部线路，按各工作单位装置电表，并分别规定用电最高用量，每月进行用电统计，亦便于月终评定各单位用电是否浪费。此外，该公司内部白天运用开着路灯的现象，因此计划设一总闸，由专人掌管开关时间，亦能节省不少电力。
