The unemployment phenomenon is particularly threatening in industrial areas such as North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg, Württemberg, Baden, and Bremen. The Labor Office of Württemberg-Baden in the American zone reported that the number of unemployed in the state reached 44,532 at the beginning of April. The Labor Office of Lower Saxony in the British zone reported that the number of unemployed in the state reached 271,605 in the second half of April.
