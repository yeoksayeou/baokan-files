Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 10th: TASS reports: The 16th Congress of the Danish Communist Party (DKP) began in Copenhagen on May 5th. At the meeting on May 8th, DKP Organization Secretary Nielsen delivered a report entitled "The Party in Struggle to Defend Peace and National Independence." Nielsen pointed out: "The main task facing the Party today is to fight for lasting peace, for people's democracy, and for national independence." Nielsen said: "Denmark has become a Marshall Plan nation and a participant in the North Atlantic Treaty because we have enemies of peace within our country. Our task is to expel a series of warmongers from the political arena." "At present, as during the war, there are two Denmarks—one is the official Denmark, which not only participates on the side of the enemies of peace, but is also preparing to attack the people's living standards. The other is the Denmark that is fighting for national independence and the interests of the people, including the working class, agricultural laborers, small farmers (i.e., poor peasants), small business owners, and intellectuals. The forces of peace are beginning to make themselves felt. We can see this in the fact that the Radical Social Party parliamentary group had to oppose the proposal to include Denmark in the North Atlantic Treaty when the parliament discussed the North Atlantic Treaty. We see this from the protest demonstrations in front of the parliament. Progressive people all over the world oppose launching a war—oppose official Denmark. If we want to achieve success, then the working class must take the leading role in this struggle for peace." Finally, Nielsen pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen the connection between the Communist Party and the broad masses of working people and expose the conspiracies of the right-wing Social Democratic leaders. "The future belongs to us, and victory is ours."

    将战贩逐出政治舞台！
    尼尔逊在丹共全代会上报告
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社讯：丹麦共产党第十六届代表大会己于五月五日起在哥本哈根举行。在五月八日的大会上，丹共组织部长尼尔逊以“为保卫和平与国家独立而战斗中的党”为题，作了一个报告。尼尔逊指出：“党今天面临的主要任务就是为持久和平、为人民民主、为国家独立而奋斗”。尼尔逊说：“丹麦之所以成为马歇尔化国家与参加北大西洋公约，是因为我们国内有和平的敌人。我们的任务就是把一系列的战争贩子逐出政治舞台。”“在目前，正如在战争期间一样，有两个丹麦—一个是官方的丹麦，它不只参加了和平的敌人方面，同时还在准备进攻人民的生活标准。另一个是正在为国家独立与人民利益而斗争的丹麦，其中包括工人阶级、农业劳动者、小农（即贫农）、小商业者和知识分子。和平的力量正在开始使人感觉出来。在议会中讨论北大西洋公约的时候，急进社会党议会党团不得不反对把丹麦纳入北大西洋公约的提案，我们在这件事中可以看到这一点。从国会门前的抗议示威中，我们看到这一点，全世界的进步人民都反对发动战争——反对官方的丹麦，如果我们想获得成就，那么，工人阶级必须在这个拥护和平的斗争中担任领导角色。”最后尼尔逊指出：必须加强共产党与广大劳动人民的联系并揭露右翼社会民主党领袖的阴谋，“未来属于我们，胜利是我们的。”
