　　Bulgarian Trade Unions
    Alekseyev
    The Bulgarian trade union movement has gone through a long and arduous road. Before the First World War, the Bulgarian trade union movement was divided. This greatly hindered the development of trade unions after the war and hampered the cause of defending the vital interests of the working class. In 1922, nineteen trade unions with 31,339 members joined the revolutionary "Trade Union Federation." At the same time, the reformist "Free Trade Union Federation" had only about 450 members. After the fascist coup in 1923, the revolutionary trade union movement was crushed. Later, in 1934, a unified "Workers' League" organized on the example of Hitler's Germany appeared in Bulgaria, and membership was compulsory.
    The Bulgarian trade unions accepted the lessons of the past and embarked on the road of unity from the birth of the truly democratic New Bulgaria. They are established according to industrial categories, with the General Trade Union as the center of the federation of trade unions. The activities of the Central Committee of the General Trade Union and the thirty-two trade unions are based on the principles of democratic centralism and trade union democracy.
    Bulgarian trade unions actively participate in the work of completing national basic tasks, because the victorious completion of these tasks is the key to determining the improvement of the living standards of the working class and all the people of Bulgaria. Bulgarian trade unions participated in the nationalization of industry, banking, and transportation, as well as the implementation of land reform. The trade unions support the government's policies.
    Bulgarian trade union organizations launched patriotic labor competitions, victoriously mobilizing workers to restore the national economy looted by the Hitler bandits, and to complete the two-year plan of national economy - the task of which is to lay the foundation for the industrialization and electrification of the country, and also promote the development of agriculture. Outstanding shock workers and labor innovators such as Podorova, Stoikov, and thousands of other outstanding talents have emerged in the labor competition. More than 250,000 people participated in the labor competition before May of this year, primarily textile workers, miners, and railway workers.
    Bulgaria had already exceeded the pre-war production level by 30 percent last year, and in the coal industry, it even reached 80 percent.
    Trade unions also actively participate in the comprehensive development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and agricultural cooperatives; agricultural cooperatives are established on the basis of complete voluntary participation. Trade unions organized many cultural labor teams, whose members are skilled workers, doctors, veterinarians, agronomists, actors, and musicians. These cultural labor teams help repair agricultural tools, carry out agricultural propaganda and cultural and political work among farmers, and consolidate the ties between urban and rural workers.
    Bulgarian trade unions have always played an active role in developing the cooperative movement. The cooperative movement has become a major factor in Bulgaria's economic life. In the sugar and timber industries, cooperatives play a leading role. In the canning, meat, and dairy industries, cooperatives account for a large proportion. Cooperatives are also becoming more deeply involved in handicraft production and agriculture.
    While striving to improve labor productivity, Bulgarian trade unions are also always concerned with improving the material life of workers and raising their cultural level. This is reflected in the activities of trade unions in labor protection, housing construction, and medical services. Trade unions carry out large-scale cultural and educational work, organizing clubs, libraries, reading rooms, workers' supplementary schools, workers' night schools, literacy classes, etc. Scientists, cultural workers, and artists often give reports and perform plays in factories and workers' clubs, helping to develop amateur artistic activities. The General Trade Union has organized about 350 theater groups, more than 500 choirs, 132 orchestras, and 79 folk dance teams.
    The most remarkable and conclusive proof that Bulgarian trade unions are full of vitality and have close ties with the masses is the unprecedented growth in the number of their members - now exceeding 600,000.
    Bulgarian trade unions actively participate in the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and actively struggle for international workers' solidarity. In a declaration issued by the Central Committee of the General Trade Union in January 1948, it was pointed out that the Bulgarian working class, faithful to the principles of international workers' solidarity, strongly supports the World Federation of Trade Unions in sanctioning splitters and further consolidating the unity of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The declaration stated: "The unity of the workers' movement was established in the common struggle of workers around the world against reactionary fascist forces. Any lackey of American imperialism is powerless to eliminate this unity."
    Bulgarian trade unions strive to consolidate and develop the friendship between the trade unions of the Balkan countries and actively participated in the conference of trade union representatives of new democratic countries held in November 1947.
    Faithfulness to the principles of people's democracy and close ties with the broad masses are the reliable prerequisites for Bulgarian trade unions to achieve further development and victory.

　　保加利亚的职工会
    阿列克歇夫
    保加利亚的职工运动是经历了长期而艰苦的道路的。保加利亚的职工运动在第一次世界大战以前是分裂的。这在战后大大地阻碍了职工会的发展，妨害了保卫工人阶级切身利益的事业。在一九二二年，十九个职工会拥有会员三万一千三百三十九人，加入了革命的“职工会联合会”。与此同时，改良主义的“自由职工会联合会”则仅有会员约四百五十人。在一九二三年的法西斯政变以后，革命的职工运动被粉碎了。后来在一九三四年，仿照希特勒德国的例子而组织的统一的“工人联盟”出现于保加利亚，其会员是强迫加入的。
    保加利亚的职工会接受了过去的教训，从真正民主的新保加利亚出世之日起便走上了团结的道路。它们是按照产业的类别建立起来的，而以总工会为联合会职工会的中心。总工会中央委员会及三十二个职工会的活动，是以民主集中制及职工会民主的原则为基础的。
    保加利亚的职工会积极地参加着完成全国性的基本任务的工作，因为这些任务的胜利完成，乃是决定工人阶级及保加利亚全体人民生活水平提高问题的关键。保加利亚的职工会参加了工业、银行与运输业收归国有以及实行土地改革的工作。职工会支持着政府的政策。
    保加利亚的职工团体展开爱国的劳动竞赛，胜利地动员工人去恢复被希特勒匪徒掠夺了的国民经济，完成国民经济两年计划--其任务是奠立国家工业化与电气化的基础，并也促进农业的发展。劳动竞赛中涌现了卓越的突击工作者、劳动革新者波多罗瓦，斯多伊科夫，及成千的其他优秀人材。参加今年五月前的劳动竞赛者在二十五万人以上，首先是纺织工人、矿工及铁路工人。
    保加利亚在去年便已超过战前生产水平达百分之三十，而在煤业方面，甚至是达百分之八十。
    职工会也积极地参加农业、畜牧业与农业合作社的全面发展；农业合作社是建立在完全自愿加入的基础上的。职工会组织了许多文化劳动队，其成员是有专门技能的工人、医生、兽医、农学家、剧人与音乐工作者。这些文化劳动队帮助修理农具，在农民中进行农学宣传与文化政治工作，巩固城乡劳动者的联系。
    保加利亚的职工会在展开合作社运动上一直是起着积极作用的。合作社运动已成为保加利亚经济生活中的重大因素。在制糖业与木材业中，合作社起着领导作用。在罐头业、肉类业与乳类业中，合作社所占的比重是很大的。合作社也更深入手工业生产和农业中了。
    保加利亚的职工会在力求提高劳动生产率的同时，也随时在关心改善工人物质生活与提高其文化水平的问题。这表现于职工会在劳动保护、住宅建造、医药服务各方面的活动上。职工会进行着大规模的文化教育工作，组织着俱乐部、图书馆、阅览室、工人补习学校、工人夜校、识字班等。科学工作者、文化工作者与艺术工作者，时常在工厂和工人俱乐部中做报告、演戏，帮助展开业余艺术活动。总工会组织了约三百五十个剧团，五百余个合唱团，一百三十二个管弦乐队与七十九个民间舞队。
    保加利亚的职工会生气勃勃，与群众有密切联系的最显著而确凿的证明，便是其会员数目的空前增长--现在已超过六十万人。
    保加利亚的职工会活跃地参加着世界职工联盟的活动，积极地为国际工人团结而斗争。总工会中央委员会在一九四八年一月发表的宣言中指出，忠实于国际工人团结原则的保加利亚工人阶级，极力支持世界职工联盟制裁分裂者和更进一步巩固世界职工联盟团结的行动。宣言中说：“工人运动的统一，是在全世界工人反对反动法西斯力量的共同斗争中建立起来的。美帝国主义的任何走狗，都是无力消灭这一统一的。”
    保加利亚的职工会力求巩固并发展巴尔干国家职工会间的友爱，积极地参加了一九四七年十一月举行的新民主国家职工代表会议。
    忠实于人民民主原则及紧密地联系广大群众，乃是保加利亚职工会取得更进一步的发展与胜利的可靠前提。
