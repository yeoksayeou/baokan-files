　　The working class in the North China Liberated Area commemorated May Day this year on an unprecedented and grand scale. Around this great anniversary, the Party and the working class have done much important work, which has powerfully promoted the restoration and development of production.

　　This year, a huge production emulation campaign was launched in various state-owned enterprises to commemorate May Day. The production achievements were significant. The famous locomotives, the Luan River Bridge, and a hundred streetcars were all repaired during this period. The production efficiency of various factories has been greatly improved. The efficiency of coal miners in Mentougou broke the 30-year record. Workers in Tianjin, Xuanhua Paper Mill, and other places voluntarily increased their working hours. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant saved 150 tons of coal in five days. Instances like these are too numerous to mention. These production achievements are May Day gifts from the working class and provide a new stimulus for future production development. In places where the production emulation campaign was well conducted, the consciousness of the workers was greatly enhanced. Workers in newly liberated major cities such as Tianjin and Beiping established a new work attitude through production. They understood that they are the leading class of society and the masters of the factories, that production is closely related to the accumulation of national capital, economic construction, and their own happiness. Therefore, they abandoned the various "go-slows" and "sabotage" residual influences used to resist class enemies during the Kuomintang rule, and replaced them with the attitude of masters who consciously organize production. Many trade union organizations and state-owned industrial management organs, relying on the enthusiasm of the working class, further mobilized workers to participate in the democratic management of factories, appropriately solved the reasonable demands raised by workers, and ensured the forward development of production. However, in some other places, the enthusiasm of workers was neglected, and workers' various difficulties were not actively resolved. They simply emphasized administrative management, thinking that as long as a set of competitions was arranged from top to bottom, everything would be fine. As a result, it only became a formality and a pursuit of awards. Even if production was improved, it was only a temporary phenomenon, and the production rate decreased after the competition was over.

　　In terms of private factories, the labor-capital relations of several private factories in Tianjin and Beiping have been typically resolved, such as Tianjin Jiuda Fine Salt Company, Dongya Wool Weaving Factory, and Beiping Cixing Iron Factory. Concrete facts have been used to explain our Party's policy of benefiting both labor and capital, so that workers understand that they should bear the responsibility of developing production and prospering the economy together with the capitalists in the capacity of masters: On the one hand, reasonable demands of workers should be met as much as possible under the conditions, and on the other hand, some excessive wage demands and excessive treatment demands of workers should be persuaded and corrected. As for the capitalists, their concerns should also be dispelled, pointing out their future and the path they should take. For example, Song Fei, the manager of Dongya Wool Weaving Company, is a typical example. He had been deceived by the Kuomintang's long-term propaganda, and after liberation, he was afraid that he would be struggled against one day. Although various measures of the People's Government had made him realize the deception of the reactionaries, he was still skeptical about the Communist Party's policies. After talking with Comrade Liu Shaoqi, he understood that the Communist Party's policies are based on the objective laws of social development and cannot transcend history. Only then did he make up his mind to develop production and set out plans to increase the factory, purchase raw materials, add night shifts, expand machinery, etc. He said: "Now, I have put down this 'passive' burden and picked up the 'active' burden. Although I feel heavy, I have confidence in carrying it well." There are similar examples in Beiping: Once the working class is persuaded, it is easy to accept the Party's policies. The various measures taken by the Party and the working class have also allowed the capitalists to grasp the "bottom line," thereby increasing their enthusiasm for production. This experience is successful and will be promoted throughout the region.

　　From this, it can be seen that the various state-owned and private factories before and after May Day have taken a big step forward. This is a major achievement for the working class and all the people in commemorating "May Day" this year. We should cherish the production enthusiasm of the working class and the capitalists that are being launched or about to be launched. We must carefully summarize this experience, correct some possible deviations, and use it to educate all cadres and people, so that the Party's policy of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, prospering the economy, and developing production can be truly implemented.

　　There is a kind of idea that is unacceptable. This is the idea that commemorating "May Day" is nothing more than various forms. Comrades with this idea may regard Comrade Li Lisan's "Explanation on the Policy of Benefiting Both Labor and Capital" as a perfunctory article and not as an explanation of a specific policy of the Party, or they may regard the various symposiums held in Tianjin and Beiping and the speeches of responsible comrades as a simple commemoration, without studying the policy spirit and profound content therein. Therefore, after "May Day," they become lax or complacent. This is not right. We should continue to work diligently and systematize and rationalize the existing experience. State-owned factories should further formulate production plans based on the foundation of the production emulation campaign, overcome the spontaneity of production, systematically establish factory management committees, factory worker representative meetings, factory security organizations, improve and enrich trade unions, and increase production. In terms of private factories, we should quickly resolve various labor-capital disputes based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, that is, to persuade workers to stop some excessive demands, and at the same time, appropriately solve workers' reasonable demands, so that workers and capitalists are jointly responsible for actively producing. We ask the North China worker representatives who are about to return to their posts to return to their posts with this spirit, unite all the staff and workers in North China, promote the work attitude of the masters, be models for all the people, and promote the common development of the production movement by people of all strata.

### 扩大“五一”成果，进一步恢复与发展生产！——并勉即将回到岗位上的华北工代会议代表

　　扩大“五一”成果，进一步恢复与发展生产！
    ——并勉即将回到岗位上的华北工代会议代表
    华北解放区工人阶级今年以空前雄伟的规模纪念五一。围绕着这一伟大纪念日，党和工人阶级作了许多重要工作，有力地推动了生产事业的恢复与发展。
    今年纪念五一各公营企业曾掀起了巨大的生产竞赛运动。生产成绩是很大的，闻名的各种机车、滦河大桥、百辆电车等都是这一时期修复的，各工厂生产效率空前提高，门头沟采煤工效率打破了三十年的纪录，天津、宣化纸厂等地工人自动增加工时，下花园发电厂五天即省煤一百五十吨，诸如此类，不胜枚举。这一生产成绩是工人阶级的五一献礼，也给今后发展生产以新的刺激。生产竞赛运动作得好的地方，都大大地提高了工人的觉悟，新解放的平津等大城市工人从生产中树立了新的劳动态度，他们懂得了自己是社会的领导阶级和工厂的主人，生产是为了积累国家资本，建设经济，同自己的幸福密切关联着，因而抛弃了曾在国民党统治时期用以反抗阶级敌人的各种“怠工”、“破坏”的残余影响，而代之以组织起来自觉生产的主人翁态度。许多工会组织与公营工业管理机关依靠了工人阶级的积极性进一步发动工人参加了工厂的民主管理，适当地解决了工人所提出的合理要求，保证了生产的向前发展。但另外也有些地方忽视发动工人积极性，不去积极解决工人各种困难，单纯强调行政管理，以为只要自上而下去布置一套竞赛，便可万事大吉，结果只有流于形式主义，锦标主义，生产即使有所提高，也只是暂时现象，竞赛一过，生产率随之降低。
    在私营工厂方面，平津两地典型地解决了几个私营工厂的劳资关系，象天津久大精盐公司、东亚毛织厂、北平慈型铁工厂等，用具体事实说明我党劳资两利的政策，让工人们懂得了要以主人翁的资格与资方共同担负发展生产繁荣经济的责任：一方面在可能条件下尽量满足工人合理的要求，另一方面又要说服与纠正工人中某些过高的工资要求和过高的待遇要求。对于资本家，也要扫除他们之中的若干疑虑，指出他们的前途和应走的道路。象东亚毛织公司经理宋ｆěｉ＠①卿便是一个典型。他受着国民党长期欺骗宣传，解放后天天疑惧会有一天斗争到他的头上，虽然人民政府各种措施已使他认清反动派的欺骗，但他对共产党的政策仍然半信半疑，经与刘少奇同志谈话，才懂得了共产党的政策是根据社会发展的客观规律的，不能超越历史，这才下决心发展生产，订出了增厂、添购原料、加开夜班、扩充机器等等计划。他说：“现在，我放下了这副‘消极’的担子，挑起了‘积极’的担子，虽感沉重，然我有信心把它挑好”。北平方面也有类似的例子：工人阶级一经说服便很容易接受党的政策。党和工人阶级的种种措施，使得资方也摸着了“底”，从而提高了生产积极性。这一经验是成功的，将会向全区推广。
    由此可见，五一前后的各公营和私营工厂都在大踏步地向前发展了一步，这是今年纪念“五一”工人阶级和全体人民一个重大收获，应当宝贵工人阶级和资本家中这些正在发动或即将发动起来的生产积极性，要很好总结这一经验，纠正某些可能的偏向，用以教育全体干部和人民，使党的公私兼顾、劳资两利、繁荣经济、发展生产的政策真正得到贯彻。
    有一种想法是要不得的。这便是认为纪念“五一”妥不过是各式各样的形式罢了，这样的同志可以把立三同志“关于劳资两利政策说明”看成是应景文章而不把它当作一个党的具体政策的说明，也可以把平津两地召开的各种座谈会以及负责同志的讲话看作一种简单的纪念，而不去研究其中的政策精神和深刻内容。因而在“五一”之后，他们便松懈或满足起来，这是不对的。应当兢兢业业继续努力，把现有经验系统化条理化，公营工厂要依据生产竞赛运动的基础进一步订立生产计划，克服生产自发性，系统地建立工厂管理委员会，工厂职工代表会议，工厂保卫组织，健全与充实工会，提高生产。在私营工厂方面要依据劳资两利原则迅速解决各种劳资悬案，即要说服工人停止某些过高的过分的要求，同时也要适当解决工人合理的要求，做到工人资本家共同负责积极生产，我们要求即将回去的华北工人代表们都能本此精神回到自己岗位，团结全华北职工，发扬主人翁的劳动态度，作全体人民的模范，推动各阶层人民共同开展生产运动。
