Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 8th. On the Nanjing-Shanghai line, in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, and in southern Anhui, the victorious People's Liberation Army is receiving a warm welcome from the broad masses of people as they advance.

  Zhenjiang
    After the People's Liberation Army liberated Zhenjiang on April 23rd, successive troops sailed south on gunboats and tugboats. For several miles along the southern bank of the river, the docks were packed with welcoming people. Workers set off firecrackers and frantically shouted, "They're here! They're here!" Students and staff from Jiangsu Medical College, Tsinghua Middle School, Zhenjiang County Middle School, and other schools organized propaganda teams and wrote slogans. One young man wrote on a wall: "Friends! Sing what you want to sing; say what you want to say!" fully reflecting the happy mood of the youth after liberation.

  Wuxi
    In Wuxi, an important industrial city in southern Jiangsu, the People's Liberation Army entered the city on the 24th. In the afternoon of the same day, a mass rally of over ten thousand people was held in the city, followed by a parade throughout the city. Industrial workers and students showed unparalleled excitement in the parade.

  Changzhou
    Students from more than ten middle schools and above in Changzhou City gathered on May 4th to commemorate the first "May Fourth" Festival after liberation. The Military Control Commission of the city also convened a commemorative meeting, with 1,600 young intellectuals and student representatives singing "Follow the Communist Party."

  Jiangyin
    After the liberation of Jiangyin, workers at the city's largest yarn factory told the People's Liberation Army personnel about their feelings on the eve of liberation, saying, "All of us more than a thousand workers in the factory knew you were coming, and no one ran away."

  Huzhou
    In Huzhou, the center of the silk industry, nearly ten thousand silk weaving workers made more than a thousand flags before liberation in preparation for welcoming the People's Liberation Army. After the People's Liberation Army entered Huzhou on the 27th, workers from various silk weaving factories, students from the Sericulture College, and citizens from other walks of life held a parade to celebrate the liberation.

  Yixing
    Workers at the Yixing electric light factory protected the machines before the People's Liberation Army entered the city to prevent destruction by the Kuomintang bandits. Before the battles in the suburbs had ended, welcoming slogans were posted everywhere in the city. The People's Liberation Army received a frenzied welcome from the citizens when they marched into the city.

  Langxi
    After the liberation of Langxi in southern Anhui, every household in the city hung up flags with the words "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" and "Support the Communist Party." Shops operated as usual, and most schools resumed classes.
