The Military Control Commission of Ping Issues Proclamation on Housing Issues
　Reasonable Resolution of Lease Disputes Satisfies Both Landlords and Tenants

[This Newspaper News] The "Proclamation on Housing Issues in This City" issued yesterday by the Military Control Commission of Ping (original text can be found on the masthead of this newspaper from yesterday and today) has been widely supported by the masses. Landlord-tenant rental disputes are numerous in Beiping, and this has almost become a serious social problem. Currently, there are two phenomena: one is that rents are too low. This is mostly for old tenants who rented houses in previous years. Due to the drastic fluctuations in prices over the years, they are still paying rent according to the monetary rent stipulated several years ago, which is almost like living in the house for free. The other is that house prices are too high. In the past, landlords rented out houses for high "in-kind" prices during housing shortages. Today, they still collect in-kind rent according to the original lease. Tenants who paid excessively high rents have stopped paying according to the original lease since liberation. These two phenomena cause rental disputes to occur from time to time. More than half of the conditions handled by the Judicial Section of the district government for mediation are rental disputes. Rental disputes also account for the majority of cases accepted by the People's Court. After the promulgation of the Military Control Commission's proclamation, most landlords and tenants believe that, according to this method, most of the unreasonable phenomena in the past can be eliminated. On the first day of the proclamation's publication, many people resolved lease disputes based on the proclamation. A tenant surnamed Wu in the seventh district rented twelve houses from a landlord surnamed Ding. Now the landlord wants to take them back for his own use and initially asked her to move out within a month. She insisted that she could only move out after four months, which caused a dispute. Yesterday, both parties went to the Judicial Section of the district government to request mediation. After the comrades of the Judicial Section mediated according to the principles and spirit of this proclamation, both parties agreed to move out completely after three months. Mrs. Liu in the second district had a rental dispute with three tenants. She demanded nine catties of millet per room per month, while the tenants only paid one catty. Yesterday, under the mediation of the Judicial Section of the district government, both parties agreed that the rent would be five catties of millet per room per month (tenants repair the house themselves). The dispute between the tenants, Old Lady Wang and Old Lady Liu, at No. 115, South Shuncheng Street, Xicheng, and the landlord has not been resolved for a long time. After reading this proclamation, they said repeatedly: "This is very fair and reasonable. It considers both those of us who rent houses and those who own houses. Let's talk to him (the landlord) about this!" Professor Fei Qing of the Law Department of Peking University also believes that this proclamation is conducive to urban construction and economic development. Now the rents in Beiping vary due to different lease terms, different rent levels, and it is not appropriate to set the rent too mechanically. Professor Fan Hong of the Department of Economics also fully agrees with the principles stipulated in this proclamation. At the same time, he believes that the original property of the various guild halls should be clearly proposed to be nationalized. Li Da and other citizens at No. 59, West Xie Street, Xicheng, pointed out that it is unreasonable to pay three months' rent when renting a house for the first time (i.e., one share goes to the landlord, one share is a deposit, and one share goes to the introducer). The exploitation by secondary landlords should also not be allowed to exist. (Zhong, Qi)

### 平军管会发出房屋问题布告　合理解决租赁纠纷主客双方均感满意

　　平军管会发出房屋问题布告
  　合理解决租赁纠纷主客双方均感满意
    【本报讯】北平军管会昨日发出的“关于本市房屋问题”的布告后，（原文见本报昨今两日报头）获得广大群众拥护。北平房东和房客租赁纠纷很多，这几乎成了社会上一个严重问题。目前存在着两种现象：一种是房租过低：这大部是一些老房客在前几年租的房子，因为历年物价激烈波动，到今天仍按照几年前规定的货币租金交租，几乎成了白住房子。一种是房价过高：过去房主在房荒时用大价“实物”租出房屋，今天仍然按原租约收实物房租，凡是房租过高的，房客在解放后已不再按原租约付租了。这两种现象使房租纠纷不时发生，各区政府司法科调解处理的条件中、半数以上是房租纠纷。人民法院所接受的案件也以房租纠纷占多数。军管会的布告发布后，大多数房主房客认为根据这个办法，过去大部分不合理的现象都能消除。在布告公布的第一天，许多人就根据布告解决了租赁纠纷：七区一位伍姓房客租赁一位丁姓房主十二间房子现在房东要收回自用，最初要她一个月内搬出。她坚持要四个月后才能搬，因而引起纠纷。昨天双方到区政府司法科去请求调解，司法科同志根据这一布告的原则和精神进行调解后，双方都同意三个月后完全搬出。二区一位刘太太和三位房客闹房租纠纷：她要求每月九斤小米一间房，而房客只给一斤。昨天在区政府司法科的调解下，双方同意房租每间每月五斤伏地小米（房客自修房子）。西城南顺城街一一五号的房客王老太太和刘老太太和房东的纠纷过去长久未能解决，读完这一布告后，她们连声说：“这很公平合理。既为咱们租房的人着想，又照顾了有房子的。咱们就拿这个和他（房东）谈吧！”北京大学法律系费青教授也认为这一个布告有利于城市建设和经济的发展。现在北平的房租因为租赁期迟早不同、租价高低不一，租金如定得太机械了，是不适宜的。经济系樊弘教授也完全同意这个布告规定的原则，同时他认为对于各会馆原有的房产，应明确的提出收归公有。西城西斜街五十九号市民李大等提出在最初租房时交三份租金（即一份归房东，一份为押金，一份给介绍人）是不合理的。二房东中间剥削亦不应允许存在。　　（仲、祺）
