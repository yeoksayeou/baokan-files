Jize and Longyao

　　Purchase Large Numbers of Oxen

　　Help Disaster-stricken People with the Summer Harvest

[Jinan Telegram] Jize and Longyao counties have issued a large number of draught animals and farm tools to help farmers in disaster areas solve the difficulties of the summer harvest. In some villages in the first, third, and fourth districts of Jize County, the autumn floods caused significant damage, and farmers were unable to afford oxen for the summer harvest. The county bank has allocated 70,000 jin of grain and entrusted the county's production promotion agency to transport 100 oxen from the south bank of the Yellow River. Sixty-six have already been transported and issued to disaster-stricken people at low interest rates. Longyao plans to allocate three-quarters of the grain and funds for production and disaster relief to purchase 500 head of livestock, which will be lent to disaster areas. The remaining one-quarter will be used to purchase agricultural implements. The first batch of 140 oxen has already been transported and lent to disaster-stricken people before the 10th of this month. The government is organizing livestock traders to purchase animals along the Yellow River, which will be transported before the wheat harvest to meet the needs of farmers.

[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The Minfeng Iron Foundry in Xiguan, Puyang County, which is jointly operated by public and private sectors, is manufacturing large quantities of farm tools, and sales are smooth. The iron foundry was established in October 1947. The manager, Zhang Chaoxing (a Communist Party member), was originally a blacksmith. With the investment and support of the government, he absorbed private equity and continuously overcame difficulties to expand production. As the area lacks coal and iron, he organized poor people to collect scrap iron and miscellaneous items from the surrounding villages and towns at a certain price, and personally went to the production area to purchase and transport coke. Most of the finished products are sold to Yuncheng, Juye and other counties. In April and early May, a total of more than 10,900 pieces of iron plowshares, plow tips, and plows were cast.

    【冀南电】鸡泽、隆尧两县大量贷发耕畜、农具，帮助灾区农民解决夏收困难。鸡泽一、三、四区部分村庄因去秋遭水灾较重，农民无力买牛夏收。该县银行，已拨粮七万斤，委托县生产推进社到黄河南岸贩运耕牛百头现已运来六十六头，以低利贷发给灾民。隆尧计划拨生产救灾粮、款四分之三，购买牲畜五百头，全贷灾区。其余四分之一，购贷农具。现首批耕牛已运到百四十头，本月十号前已全贷给灾民。现政府正组织牲口贩在黄河沿岸收购，将于麦前运到，以应农民麦收使用。
    【冀鲁豫电】濮县西关公私合办的民丰铸铁炉，大量制造农具，销路顺畅。该铸铁炉一九四七年十月成立，经理张朝兴（共产党员）原是铁匠，在政府投资扶助下，吸收私人股金，不断克服困难，扩大生产。本区缺乏煤、铁，便以一定代价组织贫苦群众到四乡收买废铁及一切杂件，并亲往产地购运焦炭。成品大部销售，郓城，巨野等县，四月份及五月上旬，即铸出铁犁面、犁铧、犁等共一万零九百余件。
