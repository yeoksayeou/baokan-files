[Jizhong Electric] The Botou Yonghua Match Company has improved product quality during its production competition. Before the competition, the leadership first educated the workers on the importance of improving quality and decided to launch a competition focused on improving quality, making inventions, and improving tools. The quantity standards for each production process were appropriately lowered to improve quality. For example, during last winter's production campaign, the highest quality for the carding shaft was 63 frames per machine per day. This time, the quantity standard was set at 56 frames, but the standard quality for the number of splints per board was required to reach 2,400. The reward method was: if the standard quality was not met, the excess production quantity would not be rewarded; only after guaranteeing the quality standard would the excess production quantity be rewarded. During the two weeks of the campaign, production developed in a balanced and normal manner. Increasing quality increased quantity and reduced costs. For example, although the number of frames decreased, the number of splints increased, so the number of frames of wood splints used per box of matches decreased from 19.7 to 17.05. Finished matches increased from an average of 30.02 boxes per day to 36.8 boxes. The creation of the flat drill for punching holes made the work regular, reduced the burrs inside the holes, and increased the output by two times compared to the previous use of the vertical drill. The modification of the oil pan and the preservation of the color of the match heads reduced waste and improved quality.

  　从提高质量中增产
    【冀中电】泊头永华火柴公司在生产竞赛中提高了产品质量。竞赛之前，领导上首先教育工人认识提高质量的重要，决定以提高质量，发明创造，和改良工具为主，展开竞赛；并把各个生产过程中的数量标准，都适当降低，以便提高质量。如去冬生产运动中，排轴最高质量，每天每部机器六十三车，这次数量标准定为五十六车，但每板苗数的标准质量则要求到二千四百根。奖励方法是：不够标准质量的，超产数量不奖；保证质量标准后，超产数量才给奖励。运动展开两周间产量平衡发展而正常。从提高质量中，增产了数量减低了成本。如车数虽减少了，但苗数增多，因而一箱火柴用梗子由十九点七车减到十七点零五车。成品火柴由每日平均三十点零二箱增到三十六点八箱。打夹眼的平钻的创造，使活又规矩，孔内毛毛减少，产量也比以前使立钻时增多了两倍。油盘的改造，火柴头色泽的保持不变等，都减少了浪费，提高了品质。
