　　The Heroic and Hard-Fought Zhejiang-Jiangxi Column
　　The predecessor of the People's Liberation Army Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Column was the guerrilla force left behind after the Red Army's Long March. Starting in 1937, this force, then with fewer than a hundred guns, under the leadership of Comrade Zeng Jingbing, waged a difficult struggle against the overwhelmingly superior Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. From 1941 to 1944, the enemy launched four large-scale "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. In the second "encirclement and suppression" in 1942, the Kuomintang reactionaries used a total of five divisions. The large-scale "encirclement and suppression" in 1943 was personally commanded by the war criminal Gu Zhutong. In order to starve this force to death, the enemy implemented a policy of merging villages and relocating people, along with a brutal Three Alls Policy (Kill All, Burn All, Loot All). All the houses in the Chong'an mountain area of Fujian were burned down. The indomitable people rebuilt their homes three times after they were burned down three times, and most of the family members of many cadres and veteran soldiers were killed. More than ten relatives and friends of Comrade Chen Guifang, one of the leaders of Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi, were killed. The reactionaries organized reactionary landlord armed forces, building bunkers and guard posts all around the mountainous areas, gradually closing in, attempting to eliminate the guerrilla force. The guerrilla force dispersed into groups of two or three people, continuing to persist in the struggle. The guerrilla fighters experienced all kinds of hardships in the deep mountains. In the desolate and precipitous Wuyi Mountains, they cooked wild vegetables and grasses in basins in caves or jungles to satisfy their hunger, eating more than a hundred kinds of wild grasses. In 1941, Comrade Li Gang, Secretary of the Jinjiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, had not eaten for five days and could no longer climb the mountain. He sat down and sang a self-composed ditty: "Comrades, be prepared, let the stubborn fools come again with a big 'encirclement and suppression'! They are useless, they are big rice buckets!" He slowly fell down and stopped breathing in this heroic song. The climate in the mountains was very cold, but there was not even a grass shed. When it rained, the guerrillas hid in caves to spend the night; if they could not find a cave, they huddled close to big trees to avoid the rain and cold. In the winter of 1941, Comrade Wang Zhu, a member of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and his guard shared a military blanket and slept under a large tree. At dawn the next day, when Wang Zhu pushed his guard, the guard's body was already frozen stiff. But despite the many cruel and vicious methods adopted by the enemy, they could never eliminate this force. Each time the enemy "encircled and suppressed," the guerrilla force would send out a part, disguised, to move behind the enemy.
　　In 1944, they raided Hanjiang (east of Putian City), an important coastal town between Fuzhou and Xiamen. In 1943, they attacked Gutian. During these difficult days, they became the hope of the suffering people of Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and they relied on the people to overcome all difficulties. One guerrilla unit lived in the home of an old widow in Changle, who had no children. The guerrillas went to the mountains during the day and helped her harvest rice in the evening. When the old woman was seriously ill, the guerrillas took care of her attentively for half a month. When they had no food to eat during their persistent fighting, the old woman risked her life to deliver food to them. The guerrilla force mobilized the masses to resist rent and taxes, opposed conscription, led the peasants to establish peasant associations, and carried out rent reduction and anti-despot struggles. In some areas of southern Zhejiang, people's democratic regimes were established. The guerrilla force and the people were as close as family members. The great victories of the People's Liberation War in the north inspired their fighting spirit, and the Kuomintang regular army that was encircling and suppressing them was forced to be transferred. The guerrilla force then developed rapidly in a short period and established the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Column. The southern Zhejiang troops under the leadership of Comrade Long Yue alone captured more than sixty light machine guns and two 60mm mortars in the second half of last year. In early March of this year, they once liberated the county seat of Taishun and wiped out a battalion of enemy reinforcements. Another guerrilla unit liberated the town of Shunchang Yiyang in northwestern Fujian, completely eliminating the enemy's self-defense brigade headquarters. When they learned of the great army crossing the river, they advanced towards the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, passing through rugged mountain roads, and met with the field army in Guixi, eastern Jiangxi, on May 5th.

　　英勇苦斗的浙赣纵队
    贺桂国
    人民解放军闽浙赣纵队的前身红军长征后留下来的游击队。从一九三七年起，这支当时不足百条枪的队伍，即在曾镜冰同志率领下，和占绝对优势的日寇和国民党反动派进行着艰苦的斗争。自一九四一年至一九四四年的四年间，敌人曾发动四次大规模的“围剿”。在一九四二年的第二次“围剿”中，国民党反动派共使用了五个师的兵力。一九四三年的大规模的“围剿”由战犯顾祝同亲自指挥。敌人为了困死这支队伍，实行了并村移民与残酷的三光政策。福建崇安山区的民房全被烧毁。顽强不屈的人民在他们的家园三次被烧后三次重建，许多干部和老战士家眷大部被杀害。闽浙赣领导者之一陈贵芳同志的亲戚和朋友被杀死的有十多人。反动派组织了反动的地主武装在山区四周满布碉堡和哨棚，逐步进逼，企图消灭游击队，游击队分散成两三人一个小组，继续坚持着斗争。游击队战士们在深山中经历了种种的苦难。在荒凉险峻的武夷山上，他们在山洞或丛林中用脸盆煮野菜野草充饥，先后吃过一百多种野草。一九四一年中国共产党晋江县委书记李刚同志五天没吃东西，在山上再也爬不动了，他坐下来唱着自编的小曲：“同志们，准备好，让顽固蛋再来一次大‘围剿’！他们没有用，是个大饭桶！”就在这豪壮的歌声中慢慢倒下去停止了呼吸。山上的气候很冷，但却连个草棚也没有。遇到下雨，游击队员便躲在山洞中度夜；找不到山洞，就几个人紧靠大树围挤着避雨避寒。一九四一年冬天，中共福建省委委员王助同志和他的警卫员合盖着一条军被，睡在一株大树下。第二天拂晓，当王助推他的警卫员时，警卫员的身子已冻得僵硬了。但是尽管敌人采取了许多凶残狠毒的办法，却永远不能消灭这支队伍。每次敌人“围剿”时，游击队就分出一部分化装转入敌人的背后继续活动。
    一九四四年他们曾袭入福州和厦门间滨海的重要市镇涵江（在蒲田城东），一九四三年他们曾攻入了古田。在这些艰苦的日子里，他们成了苦难的闽浙赣人民的希望，而他们依靠人民战胜了一切困难。有一支游击队住在长乐的一个寡妇老太太家里，她没有一个儿女。游击队员们白天到山上去，晚上就去帮助她收稻。老太太病得很重时，游击队员们体贴地看护了她半个月，当他们在坚持战斗中没粮食吃的时候，这个老太太便冒着生命的危险给他们送粮。游击队发动群众拖租拖税，反对征粮征丁，领导农民建立农民会，进行减租反恶霸斗争，浙南有些地区并建立起人民民主政权。游击队与人民亲如家人。人民解放战争在北方的重大胜利，鼓舞了他们的斗志，围剿他们的国民党正规军，被迫调走了。游击队便在短期间迅速发展，成立了闽浙赣纵队，仅在龙跃同志领导下的浙南部队，去年下半年就缴获了轻机枪六十多挺和两门六零炮。今年三月初，他们曾一度解放泰顺县城，并消灭来援敌人一个营。另部游击队则解放了闽西北顺昌峓阳镇，将敌自卫大队部全部解决。在他们闻知大军渡江的时候，他们便向浙赣铁路挺进，通过崎岖山路，在五月五日与野战军会师于江西东部的贵溪。
