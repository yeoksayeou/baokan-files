    Juan, Yun and Other Places
    Scraping Wasteland and Rushing Planting
    [Ji Lu Yu Electric] In Juancheng, Yunbei, Yuncheng, and Hua County in Ji Lu Yu and a part of the Third Special District, work to eliminate wasteland has achieved initial results. Juancheng originally had 700 hectares of wasteland last year. Through the government's vigorous organization of the masses to carry out rush planting, 600 hectares have been reclaimed, and there are still more than 100 hectares of wasteland this year. The types and reasons for this wasteland are: (1) Public wasteland. Most of it is "collective land," such as "public wasteland" of 5 hectares in Chenliangji Village in the county. This type of wasteland was distributed to farmers' associations, militias, women's associations, etc. during the land reform for "various plantings." Now the county has decided to distribute this so-called wasteland to farmers for cultivation. (2) Sandy land and alkaline land. The soil quality is good, but the grain yield is low. Farmers are afraid of bearing the same burden as other soil qualities, which is not enough to cover the costs, so no one cultivates it. (3) Those who genuinely lack labor and animal power to cultivate, mainly families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, widows, orphans, and the old, weak, sick, and disabled. The leading organs of the county are studying methods to eliminate wasteland based on the above different situations, striving to sow seeds quickly. A key village in Yunjü organized 15 small mutual aid groups under the principle of voluntariness through equivalent mutual aid. Those with manpower but without animal power helped each other with manpower and energy, and those without both manpower and animal power exchanged grass and fodder for cattle labor. Everyone felt that this solution to the problem of eliminating wasteland and sowing seeds was reasonable. Based on the above situation, the Industry Department of the Administrative Office of this district has recently used methods such as writing letters, making phone calls, and sending people to inspect, urging and assisting various places to quickly organize forces and strive to eliminate wasteland and sow seeds. It pointed out that public land should be distributed reasonably and quickly, and it should be guaranteed that whoever sows it will reap it. Thoroughly publicize the new agricultural tax regulations to dispel public concerns. For those without labor, such as families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the masses should be mobilized and organized to provide assistance, and appropriate compensation should be given to those who cultivate on their behalf through labor exchange methods.

    鄄郓等地
    灭荒抢种
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫鄄城、郓北、郓城、滑县及三专区之一部，消灭荒地工作、已获初步成绩。鄄城去年原有荒地七百顷，经政府大力组织群众实行抢种，已灭荒六百顷，今年尚有百余顷荒地。这些荒地的种类和原因是：（一）公荒。多为“团体地”，如该县陈良集一村即有“公荒”五顷。此种荒地系土改时分给农会、民兵、妇会等的“种种地”，现该县已经决定将此称荒地分给农户种地。（二）沙地、碱地。地质好、收粮少、农民怕和其他地质同样拿负担、不够本、因此无人耕种。（三）劳畜力确实缺乏无力耕种者，主要是烈军工属，寡孤独及老弱残病者的土地。该县领导机关根据上述不同情况，正分别研究灭荒办法，争取迅速下种。郓巨某重点村以等价互助办法，在自愿原则下，组织了十五个小的互助组，有人力而无畜力者，以人力和奋力互助，人畜力都没有的，则以草料换牛工。这样解决灭荒下种问题大家都感合理。根据上述情况，本区行暑业处日前已用写信、电话、派人检查等方法，督促及协助各地迅速组织力量，争取灭荒下种。指出：公地应合理迅速分配，并保证谁种谁收。深入宣传新农业税则，解除群众顾虑。对烈军工属等无劳力者，应动员组织群众予以帮助，更换工办法，予代耕者以适当报。
