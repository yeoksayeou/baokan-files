    The Democratization of Factory Management
    ——A Record of Attending the North China Workers' Representative Conference
    By Our Reporter Lù Hào

    To implement the democratization of factory management – this is the resolution of the Sixth National Labor Congress. In the audience of the North China Workers' Representative Conference, I heard the representatives discussing the most how to implement the democratization of management. Facts prove that properly solving this problem is a reliable guarantee for improving and increasing the production of state-owned and public enterprises. The tortuous roads we have taken in the past have educated us, and more importantly, the brilliant light of success has encouraged us to move forward.

    To Quickly Restore and Develop Production, We Must Care About the Actual Difficulties of Workers

    Combining the improvement of production with the possible improvement of workers' welfare facilities is a problem that cannot be ignored in the restoration and development of production. According to the plans of higher authorities, the Xuanhua Yantongshan Iron Mine was supposed to increase its workers from over one hundred to five hundred and fifty from March to May, and the output was required to be five hundred tons per day. The actual situation now is that the daily output is forty to fifty tons, and there are only three hundred workers. The main reason for this is that the wage problem has not been well adjusted until now. Although there was a subsidy, the workers at the Baoxing Coal Mine in Xiahuayuan can earn 19 jin of millet for the same work underground, while the Yantongshan Iron Mine workers can only earn seven jin. Recently, a car driver went from Shijingshan. His original salary was 460 jin of millet, but when he arrived at Yantongshan, he inquired that the salary was only 346 jin, and he went back the next day. Due to the rapid recovery of the steel industry in Shijingshan, the output of the Yantongshan Iron Mine urgently needs to be increased. But apart from the actual problems of the miners in their lives, the production plan cannot be realized.

    "I am in charge of production, it is not my business for the workers to eat and live." Some trade union comrades also have this view. For example, because the masses in Xiguan, Changzhi, did not pay for water, the water company stopped the water supply. As a result, the families of the workers of the Huafeng Iron Factory could not get water either. The workers went to the trade union director, and the director said: "Do I take care of drinking water?" This small matter dragged on for several days before it was resolved. In real life, the Taihang District Dazhong Coal Mine has truly made the working masses feel the close relationship between the new democratic factory and them. The mine built one hundred and sixty new houses last year. Except for fifteen rooms used as warehouses, the rest were all provided to the workers, while our manager still lived in the old temporary houses. In the summer, there were fleas in the new houses, so the mine made bed boards for the workers, which greatly moved the workers. They said: "Now it's different, we have to be worthy of the mine." Therefore, whenever the mine is in trouble, the workers always say: "As long as we can eat, we have to work hard." From their own experience, they really feel that the mine is their own. This allows the workers to exert their strength to the fullest without any worries.

    To Make a Good Production Plan, We Must Discuss it with the Masses

    Many facts prove that only production plans that have been widely discussed, revised, and supplemented by the working masses can ensure that the workers implement them completely. On the contrary, failure is inevitable. When the Taiyue Huafeng Iron Factory summarized its work for a month, it asked the workers how much they had completed, but the workers did not know what the production plan was all about. Once, the Taihang Fengfeng Coal Mine decided to open an inclined slope by one or two comrades in the administration, but in fact this place had already been done, resulting in a waste of economy and manpower. If they had asked the old workers at that time, they would have told you and avoided this loss. The facts have educated the responsible comrades of the Fengfeng Coal Mine. Now, when making plans, the factory director and engineering personnel first draft a plan, then hand it over to the factory management committee for discussion, and then hold an expanded cadre meeting, and absorb labor heroes and production backbones to participate, and then hand it over to the workers for discussion in units of districts and teams. The result of announcing the production plan to all the workers and handing it over to all the workers for discussion is that after the workers understand their plan, they can consciously and voluntarily implement it. For example, Tongshun Mine plans to complete 300,000 tons of coal mining this year. Everyone feels that the task is very heavy. Usually, during the busy farming season, some workers have to go home temporarily, so they automatically propose to overcome the fluidity. Labor hero Fan Dabao also organized a shock team for this reason. Wherever there is a difficulty, he goes there, so that the production plan is truly guaranteed by the masses and realized. The Jizhong Bozhen Yonghua Match Company has obtained correct revisions as a result of handing over the production plan to all the workers for discussion. For example, for cutting large strips, it was originally stipulated that only two out of one hundred pieces were allowed to have a width difference of no more than one millimeter. The workers said: "This can't be achieved anyway." Because in the past, only quantity was sought, not quality. Some large strips had a width difference of one-third, and some large boards were so crooked that even the trademark could not be pasted. There had never been a standard before, and this time it was based on subjective wishes out of thin air. Later, it was revised to allow up to 20% of the substandard products as a direction for effort. As a result, it took half a month to test, and the substandard products still reached 50%, and it was not until recently that it slowly approached the above requirements. The plans made by the working masses can win the enthusiastic support of the working masses themselves. The average output of the five types of workers underground in the Fengfeng Coal Mine was 0.5 tons of coal per person per day in the past, but now it has reached 0.85 tons. Last year, a Li worker made seven flange plates a day. After changing to piecework, the highest was twenty-one. Later, they simply pursued quantity, which reduced the quality. Due to the mutual supervision of the working masses, it has now been changed back to the Li worker system. Now, not only is the quality good, but the quantity has also exceeded the twenty-one when working by the piece, and the highest has reached twenty-three or twenty-four per day.

    Tell the Workers All the Factory's Information So That the Workers Can Truly Become the Masters of the Factory

    Not only hand over the production plan to the workers for discussion, but also tell the workers all the factory's raw materials, sales, profits, or losses, and listen to the opinions of the working masses on production management at all times. The best form is to organize a factory management committee. Although some of the existing factory management committees in North China have achieved many results, some are actually just a formality. For example, Wu Jinke, the representative of the Taiyue Huafeng Iron Factory, said: "I am in the factory, I don't know what the factory management committee does." The management committee of Taihang Industrial Company only convenes workers' meetings when there are difficulties in production or to complete tasks, so the workers say when they meet: "This is something we have to do again." Some workers jokingly say: "Are we still like masters?" In fact, this is a serious opinion. Facts prove that as long as the workers are told the truth about all the situations, it will increase the workers' sense of ownership and win the workers' understanding and enthusiastic support. The Taihang Dazhong Coal Mine was so poor that it had no money for a period of time. The mine explained the real situation to the workers, which won the workers' understanding. The workers could not receive their wages, so they brought dry food and pancakes from home to go down to the kiln without complaint. And when making money, don't be afraid that the workers will ask for dividends. The Jizhong Bozhen Yonghua Match Company reported to the workers that they had earned 20 billion border currency last year and explained that they used the money to restore the production of the Baoding and Cangxian flour companies. The Jizhong economic leading organs called them "mother machine factories." The workers excitedly asked: "Do other factories know too?" Therefore, they worked harder. Now, compared with the Zhonghua Match Company in Tianjin, although the number of employees is equal, Zhonghua uses power to run twenty-one sorting machines, while Yonghua uses manpower to run only fourteen sorting machines, but the output is about eighty boxes per day. The Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory has greatly strengthened the workers' sense of responsibility because it can report the factory's situation to the workers every month. In April, the factory made money. After the responsible comrades publicly reported to all the employees, the workers automatically requested to increase the night shift and improve production efficiency.

    Relying on the Strength of All Employees, Any Problem Can Be Solved Easily

    Is the management of the factory to rely solely on the inspection of a few people by means of coercion? Or rely on mobilizing the conscious and voluntary collective power of the working masses? This seems to be indisputable. But in fact, it is not the case. In our work, even things like abolishing an unreasonable search-waist system that insults the personality of workers (in the past, workers in Kuomintang factories had to be searched all over their bodies when they left the factory to see if there was any theft) also had differences. Some leading comrades in the Tangshan Machinery Factory have always insisted on retaining this system until now, and the workers suspiciously ask: "When can it be abolished?" If you don't believe in the power of your own workers, of course you won't listen to the voices of the working masses. However, the Tianjin Zhongfang No. 1 and No. 2 factories have a different situation. The workers themselves proposed to ensure mutual supervision. The leaders accepted these opinions and abolished this system. The general phenomenon of theft is now gone. Is it to use coercive methods and rely on the inspection of a few people, or to rely on the conscious and voluntary of the working masses? This is a question of principle of whether or not to believe in the power of the working masses. The Fengfeng Coal Mine also had such a lesson: Once, in order to mobilize the workers to support the worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to donate money, the trade union director of the machine factory deducted the workers' wages from the accounting office without consulting the workers at all. The workers expressed their dissatisfaction with his method. Knowing this, he used an even cruder method. He summoned the workers and asked: "Who doesn't want to donate money, raise your hand?" He vainly tried to threaten the workers with this, and the workers were even more dissatisfied and really raised their hands, directly hitting his commandism style. Later, he admitted his mistake, and the workers quickly donated the money. They said: "As long as we discuss it, who wouldn't want to donate money? His method is too bad." In Fengfeng, due to the initial implementation of democratic factory management, relying on the workers' masses has resulted in great achievements in mutual supervision in production work. A worker in a fourth team underground moved the white line (a sign of how much coal is mined) back three hundred millimeters, and someone came out to interfere. Once underground, a worker pushed a coal truck straight over, and a water pump was placed on the railway and not moved away. Sixty-year-old Fang Xiangting stopped the coal truck with his body. The pusher said: "Why are you hindering me from getting coal?" Old Fang said: "How much is it worth for you to get one more truck of coal? What if the water pump is damaged?" Old Fang was originally watching the windmill. In order to protect the water pump, he disregarded the danger and stood up bravely. His spirit moved many people. When the workers really regard the factory as their own home, the workers' strength can be fully and frequently exerted, and bureaucrats will no longer find their market.

    工厂管理民主化问题
    ——华北职工代表会议旁听记
    本报记者  陆灏
    实行工厂管理民主化——这是全国第六次劳动大会的决议。我在华北职工代表会议的旁听席上，听到代表们讨论最多的，就是如何实行管理民主化的问题。事实证明，适当地解决这个问题，乃是改进和提高国营和公营企业生产的可靠保证。过去走过的曲折道路教育了我们，更重要的是成功的辉耀的光彩鼓舞着我们前进。
    为了迅速恢复发展生产必须关心工人实际困难
    将改进生产和尽可能的改进工人的福利设备结合起来，这是恢复与发展生产中不容疏忽的问题。宣化烟筒由铁矿按照上级的计划，该矿从三月份到五月份，工人要从一百多人增加到五百五十人，产量则要求日产五百吨。现在实际情况是日产四十吨到五十吨，工人只有三百多。这主要的原因是工资问题直到现在没有很好调整。虽然经过一次补贴，但同是下井工作，下花园的宝兴煤矿每个工可以挣小米十九斤，而烟筒山铁矿只能挣七斤多。最近由石景山去了个汽车司机，他原来的薪金是四百六十斤小米，到了烟筒山，打听薪金只有三百四十六斤，第二天就回去了。由于石景山炼钢业的迅速恢复，烟筒山铁矿的产量迫切需要提高。但离开了该矿矿工在生活上存在的实际问题，生产计划就无法实现。
    “我是管生产的，工人吃饭、住房子不是我的事。”有的工会工作同志也有这种说法。如长治西关群众因为吃水没有付钱，自来水公司就停止了水的供应。于是华丰铁工厂工人的家属也因此得不到水喝。工人们去找工会主任，主任说：“吃水我还管？”就这件小事，拖了好几天才解决。在实际的生活中，真正使工人群众感觉新民主主义的工厂与他们之间的亲切关系，太行区大众煤矿做到了这一点。该矿去年盖了一百六十间新房子，除了十五间做了仓库，剩下全供给了工人，而我们的经理还住在过去临时的旧房子里。夏天新房子里有跳蚤，矿方又给工人们做了铺板，这就使得工人们大为感动。他们说：“现在可不一样了，咱们也总要对得起矿方。”因而矿方每逢有困难的时候，工人们总是说：“只要我们能吃饭就可以，咱们总得好好干下去。”他们从亲身经历中，的确感觉到矿山是自己的了。这就能使工人尽情的发挥力量而无所顾虑。
    要生产计划订得好一定要和群众商讨
    很多事实证明，只有经过工人群众广泛的讨论、修正和补充的生产计划，才能使工人保证全部实施。与此相反，则失败无疑。太岳华丰铁工厂一个月工作到总结的时候，问工人完成了多少，工人还不知道生产计划是怎么回事。太行峰峰煤矿有一次由行政上一两个同志决定开个斜马机坡，但实际上这个地方已经是做过的，结果是浪费了经济和人力。当时要是肯问问年老的工人，他们就会告诉你，避免这种损失。事实教育了峰峰煤矿的负责同志，现在做计划的时候，厂长和工程人员先拟草案，然后交给工厂管理委员会讨论，再开扩大的干部会，并吸收劳动英雄、生产骨干参加，再以区队为单位交给工人讨论。这种将生产计划向全体工人宣布并交给全体工人讨论的结果，使工人们了解了自己的计划后，即能自觉自愿地去执行。如通顺矿今年要完成三十万吨的采煤计划，大家感到任务很重，平常农忙时总有一部分工人临时要回家，于是就自动提出来克服流动性。劳动英雄范大保更因此组织了突击队，那里有困难，就到那里去，使生产计划真正获得群众的保证而实现。冀中泊镇永华火柴公司，由于生产计划交给全体工人讨论的结果，得到了正确的修正。如切大条，原来规定一百块只允许有两块宽窄不能超过一厘，工人们说：“这无论如何也达不到。”因为过去只求数量，不讲质量，大条有的宽窄相差三分之一，有的大板歪得连商标也糊不住。从来没有过标准，这次又是按着主观愿望凭空想的，后来修改成不合标准的可达百分之二十，作为一个努力的方向，结果用半个月的时间来试验，不合标准的仍达百分之五十，直到最近才慢慢接近上述要求。工人群众所订的计划，能获得工人群众自己热情的拥护，峰峰煤矿过去井下五种工人的平均产量为每人日产煤○·五吨，现在则达到○·八五吨；去年一个里工每天做七个法蓝盘改成包件制后，最高做到二十一个。后来又单纯追求数量，而使质量减低。由于工人群众相互监督，现又改成里工制，现在不但质量好，而且数量也已经超过按件计工时的二十一个，最高的达到日产二十三个或二十四个了。
    将工厂全部情况告诉工人使工人真正成为工厂主人
    不但是将生产计划交给工人讨论，同时将工厂全部的原料、推销、营利或赔钱的情况也全部告诉给工人，并在生产管理上时时听取工人群众的意见。最好的形式，就是组织工厂管理委员会。华北现有的工厂管理委员会中，虽有部分取得了不少成绩，但有的实际上还形同虚设。如太岳华丰铁工厂的代表吴金科说：“我在工厂，我不知道工厂管理委员会是干什么的。”太行实业公司的管委会，因为只是在生产上有了困难或为了完成任务才召集工人开会，所以工人们开会时就说：“这又是有事要咱们做了。”有的工人好象开玩笑说：“这我们还象主人？”其实这是严肃的意见。事实证明：向工人只要真实的说明全部情况，就更会增进工人主人翁的感觉，就更会取得工人的谅解和热情的拥护。太行大众煤矿有个时期穷得没有钱，矿上将实在情况向工人说明白，取得了工人的谅解。工人们领不到工资，他们从家里带上干粮和煎饼下窑，并无怨言。而在赚钱的时候，也不要害怕工人会要求分红。冀中泊镇永华火柴公司，向工人报告了去年赚钱二百亿边币的情况，并且说明将这笔钱恢复了保定、沧县面粉公司的生产。冀中经济领导机关称他们为“母机工厂”。工人们十分兴奋的问：“别的工厂也知道吗？”因而他们格外努力。现在他们和天津的中华火柴公司相比，职工数目虽然相等，但中华用动力开二十一个排梗机，永华用人力只开十四个排梗机，然而产量却都是日产八十箱左右。天津钢铁配件厂，由于每个月能够向工人报告工厂的情形，大大的加强了工人的责任心。四月份该厂赚了钱，负责同志公开向全体职工报告后，工人们自动要求增加夜班，提高了生产效率。
    依靠全体职工力量办事任何问题都可迎刃而解
    工厂的管理，是用强制的办法单单依靠几个人的检查呢？还是依靠发动工人群众自觉自愿集体的力量？这看来已经是无可争议的了。但其实不然，在我们工作中，如废除一种侮辱工人人格的不合理的搜腰制度（过去国民党工厂的工人出厂，全身要被搜一遍，看看是否有偷窃行为），连这样的事也有分歧。唐山机厂的部分领导同志，一直还坚持着保留了此种制度直到现在，工人们怀疑的问：“到什么时候可以取消呢？”不相信工人自己的力量，当然就不会听取工人群众的呼声。但是，天津中纺一、二厂就有另外的情况，工人们自己提出来，保证互相监督，领导上接受了这些意见，废除了这种制度，一般的偷窃现象现在是没有了。用强制的办法，依靠几个人的检查，还是依靠工人群众的自觉自愿？这是一个带有原则性的是否相信工人群众力量的问题。峰峰煤矿也有过这样的教训：有一次为了动员工人支援国民党统治区的工人兄弟而募捐，机器厂工会主任根本不和工人商量，就在会计处扣工人的工资，工人对他的方式表示不满，他知道了，用了一个更粗鲁的办法，他召集了工人问：“谁不出钱举手？”妄想以此威胁工人，工人们更加不满，真的全举了手，直率的打击了他的强迫命令作风。后来他承认了错误，工人们很快的捐出了钱，他们说：“只要商量一下，谁还不愿意出钱？他的方式太坏了。”在峰峰，由于初步实行工厂民主管理，依靠工人群众的结果，工人们在生产工作上的相互监督收到很大成绩。四区队一个井下工人将白线（一种刨煤多少的记号）移后了三百米厘，有人就出来干涉。有一次在井下，一个工人推着煤车直泻过来，铁道上放了个水泵没有移去，六十多岁的房相亭以身体拦住煤车。推车的说：“为什么妨碍我出煤？”房老说：“你多出一车煤值多少钱？把水泵碰坏了怎么办？”房老本是看风磨的，他为了保护水泵，不顾危险，挺身而出，他的精神，使很多人受了感动。当工人们真正把工厂看作是自己的家一样，工人的力量就能充分的经常的发挥，官僚主义者就再也找不到自己的市场了。
