　　"Mao Zedong" Locomotive Arrives in Baoding
　　Our Correspondent Chen Ji
　　The Ping-Bao section officially opened to traffic on May 20th. Today, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, polished brightly by the workers, proudly departed from Beijing East Station with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in front and decorated with huge red flags on both sides. After the liberation of Beijing, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive traveled from Harbin to Beijing, bringing infinite glory to the people of Beijing. On May 3rd, when the news of the repair of the Gao (Beidian) - Bao (ding) section reached Fengtai, the workers of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive excitedly requested to undertake the first mission to Baoding. Worker Gao Baoheng said, "We are going to Baoding to learn the working spirit of the road construction workers." Today, they truly received this glorious opportunity. At ten o'clock in the morning, the train left Beijing amidst the cheers and music of the Beijing railway workers. Passing through Lugou Bridge, workers beside the bridge were busily replacing new sleepers, having completed the task of repairing the bridge within the limited time of seven days in just three days of intensive work. Today, seeing their train passing over the bridge they had repaired, their faces beamed with the light of victory. As the locomotive passed through Changxindian, representatives of the Changxindian railway workers pointed to the railway factory next to the station and said, "Our Changxindian workers launched a vigorous production competition to ensure the supply of materials for the repair of the Gao-Bao section. Most of the spikes and fishplates in this section were made by our Changxindian workers."
　　The rapid repair of the Ping-Bao section was due not only to the workers' tireless work with unparalleled enthusiasm but also to the enormous efforts of the broad masses of farmers along the line in Liangxiang, Fangshan, Laizhuo, Yixian, Dingxing, Xushui, Anguo, Lixian, Dingxian, and other places. They mobilized 25,000 carts to transport sleepers, and approximately 200,000 people participated in the tree felling and timber sawing projects. The farmers along the road also carried stones and steel rails, repaired the roadbed, and encouraged the road construction workers' unlimited work enthusiasm. Comrade Meng Xianzhang, director of the Ping-Bao section road construction office, emphasized, "When it comes to awarding merit, the villagers' contribution should be the first."
　　As the "Mao Zedong" locomotive passed through each village, the villagers scrambled to watch, cheering and applauding. They had eagerly awaited a fast means of transportation that could transport grain and raw materials to supply the cities, transport daily necessities to supply the countryside, and transport ammunition to support the Liberation War. Today, this means of transportation had arrived, and they rejoiced and celebrated. A villager near Dingxing County Station said, "Just a few days ago, we were still carrying stones and wood here. Oh, it's open to traffic today! Tomorrow we can take the train to Baoding to buy and sell things."
　　As the train passed the Beihe Bridge, the bridge repair workers standing on the bridgehead, seeing the "Mao Zedong" they had eagerly awaited, rushed onto the bridge like madmen, lifted the railway labor hero Li Yong out of the locomotive, and shouted, "Learn from Li Yong, learn from the working spirit of the Mao Zedong locomotive!" Li Yong called on them: Our railway must follow the People's Liberation Army and be built forward, wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, we will build there. All the bridge workers responded in unison. They said to the Mao Zedong locomotive workers: "The higher authorities stipulated that the Beihe Bridge should be completely repaired by July 10th, but now we have decided to advance the deadline by ten days and guarantee the completion of the repair on July 1st. We will give this gift to the Communist Party for its birthday." Their captain, Guo Wei, pointed to the temporary bridge that was about to be crossed and said, "We rushed to build this 209-meter-long temporary bridge with only over a hundred people, and it was completed in two days." He spoke enthusiastically about the workers' recent work enthusiasm, and particularly mentioned one thing: "A few days ago, it rained, and more than 2,000 sleepers were under the bridge and were about to be washed away by the water, which made us anxious. All 65 of us workers were determined to rescue them. The sleepers were heavily soaked in water, each weighing about 200 kilograms, and were stuck in the mud, making it difficult to lift them out." He said, "Who knew that all of us, in one breath, lifted all those more than 2,000 sleepers in seven hours."
　　Between Gucheng and Xushui, 110 kilometers and 700 meters away from Beijing, a wooden stick about two feet long was inserted, with the words: "Ping-Bao Section First and Second Engineering Teams Victory Rail Connection Commemorative Monument." This is the most memorable marker of the 82 kilometers and 672 meters repaired by the First and Second Engineering Teams on May 3rd. On this day, they didn't eat, didn't rest, moved steel rails, nailed spikes, put on fishplates... They were victorious, and the flags of victory spread throughout the Ping-Bao section.
　　In a short period of time, more than 50 labor heroes emerged on this railway. Among them was a 62-year-old worker from the Baoding Transportation Section, Wang Mingxi, who walked from Baoding to Beihe to participate in the bridge repair work. He competed with the young people, and he carried 20 baskets of soil in one breath. He said, "We have to compare with the young people to see if the old people are behind?" He worked actively, and his learning was also a leading role model. He was selected as a labor model, and his work became even more energetic. These labor heroes were decided after many democratic evaluations. At the Ping-Bao opening ceremony on the 20th, they will receive glorious medals.
　　The "Mao Zedong" locomotive arrived in Baoding at 6:30 pm on the 19th. Workers, students and other masses in Baoding went to the station to welcome it. This is the glory of the workers. Driver Li Yong said, "Baoding has arrived, and Hankou is waiting for us. Workers, work harder and rush to repair the entire Ping-Han Railway."

　　“毛泽东号”机车开到保定
    本报记者  陈迹
    五月二十日，平保段正式通车了。今天“毛泽东号”机车被工人们擦得亮亮的，机车前面挂着毛主席的巨像，两旁饰以巨大红旗，很骄傲地从北平东站出发了。在北平解放后，“毛泽东号”机车从哈尔滨开到北平，曾带给北平人民无限的光荣；五月三日，高（碑店）保（定）段修复的消息传到了丰台，“毛泽东号”机车工人兴奋的要求担任首次开往保定的任务，工人高保恒说：“我们到保定去，学习筑路工人的工作精神。”今天，他们果真得到了这个光荣的机会。上午十点钟，列车在北平铁路工人的欢呼和音乐声中离开北平。路过芦沟桥，桥旁工人正紧张地更换新枕木，他们曾以三天的功夫，突击完成限期七天修复该桥的任务。今天，他们看见自己的火车走过自己修复的铁桥，脸上流露出胜利的光彩。机车穿过长辛店，长辛店铁路工人代表指着车站旁边的铁路机厂说：“我们长辛店工人为保证供给高保段修路的材料，曾掀起如火如荼的生产竞赛。这一段的道钉、夹板，大多是我们长辛店工人干出来的。”
    平保段得以迅速修复，除了工人们以无比的热情紧张工作而外，沿线良乡、房山、涞涿、易县、定兴、徐水、安国、蠡县、定县等地广大农民，都出了巨大的力量。他们动员了二万五千辆大车运送枕木；约有二十万人工参加了伐树锯道木的工程。沿路的农民又搬运石头、钢轨，修整路基，鼓励了筑路工人无限的工作热情。平保段筑路处主任孟宪章同志强调地说：“论功行赏，老乡们的功劳应该是第一。”
    “毛泽东号”机车路过每个村庄，老乡们都争相观望，欢呼鼓掌。他们热切盼望着的快速的交通工具，能够运输粮食原料供给城市，运输日用品供给乡村，能够运送弹药支援解放战争的交通工具今天已经盼到了，今天他们欢欣鼓舞着。定兴县车站附近的老乡说：“不几天以前咱们还在这里搬石子运木头，哎呀，今天就通车啦，明天咱们可以坐火车到保定去买卖东西了。”
    车过北河桥，站在桥头上的修桥工人，看见了他们殷切期待着的“毛泽东号”来了，都发狂似地涌到桥上，从机车里面，抬出了铁路劳动英雄李永，喊着“学习李永，学习毛泽东号工作精神。”李永向他们号召：我们的铁路要跟在解放军后面向前修，解放军打到那里就修到那里。全体桥工同声响应。他们向毛泽东号机车工人说：“上级规定七月十日完全修复北河桥，现在我们决定提前十天，保证在七月一日完成修复，我们将以这个礼物送给共产党做寿。”他们的队长郭蔚指着要过的便桥说：“我们突击这个二百零九米长的便桥，只有一百多人，两天就完成了。”他畅谈最近工人们的工作热情，特别提出了这样一件事：“前几天下雨，有两千多根枕木在桥下，将要被水冲走，我们急坏了。我们全体六十五个工人，决心要抢救。枕木被水浸得很重，每块枕木约重二百公斤，陷在泥坑里，很不容易起出来。”他说：“哪知道，我们大伙儿一口气，在七小时内就把这两千多枕木抬完了。”
    在固城与徐水之间，离北平一百一十公里七百公尺的地方，插了一根长约二尺的木棍，上面写着：“平保段第一二工程队胜利接轨纪念碑。”这就是五月三日，第一二工程队修复了八十二公里六百七十二公尺的最可纪念的标记。这一天，他们不吃饭，不停息，搬钢轨，钉道钉，上夹板……他们胜利了，胜利的旗帜插遍了整个平保段。
    没有多久的日子，在这条铁路上，出现了五十多个劳动英雄。其中有个保定运输段的六十二岁老工人王名溪，由保定步行到北河参加修桥工作，他和青年人竞赛，他一口气挑了二十筐土，他说，“咱得和青年人比比，看看老年人落后不？”他工作积极，学习又能起带头作用，他被选为劳动模范，工作更起劲了。这些劳动英雄都是经过好多次的民主评定才决定了的。在二十日的平保通车典礼大会上，他们要得到光荣的勋章。
    “毛泽东号”在十九日下午六时半开到了保定，保定的工人、学生和其他群众都到站欢迎，这是工人的光荣。司机李永说：“保定到了，汉口等着我们哩。工人们再努力，赶修平汉全路。”
