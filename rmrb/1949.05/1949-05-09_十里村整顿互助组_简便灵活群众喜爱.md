[Taihang Telegram] Ten-Li Village in Huguan County, led by labor hero Xiang Tishui, has greatly promoted spring plowing production by, based on the masses’ preference for simple, flexible, and freely accessible small-scale mutual aid, carrying out planned and led mutual aid rectification on the basis of fully developing democracy. The village's mutual aid organization began in 1943. At that time, like general mutual aid teams, it gradually formed a fixed format of "mutual aid at all times, collective in all matters" during its development, and absorbed the experience of the "three combinations" from other places, stipulating a set of complex work-point recording and profit distribution methods. By the time of the 1948 mutual aid rectification, the masses unanimously felt that the work exchange was complicated, the accounting was troublesome, and especially the emphasis on centralized work was even more unsatisfactory to the masses. At that time, Comrade Xiang Tishui changed the mutual aid method based on the opinions of the masses, organizing it into a small-scale mutual aid form. Everyone stipulated that except for urgent work during busy farming seasons such as spring plowing, summer planting, and autumn harvest, if they could do the general work themselves, they would not emphasize mutual aid. If they could not do it themselves or were willing to help each other, they would voluntarily get together, whether it was three people or five people, to carry out small-scale mutual aid activities. This way, it neither feared forming formalism nor did it become unguided, and the masses were very satisfied. This year, in order to respond to the call for a 10% increase in production, Comrade Tishui first publicized the Party and government's various policies of rewarding the masses for production and getting rich, in order to overcome the ideological concerns of the masses. Then, he immediately began to rectify mutual aid. The method of rectification was: first, clarify the achievements of mutual aid in the past, then democratically criticize the shortcomings. Based on the demands of the masses and personal experience, carry out free group formation. After the masses recalled and summarized, they unanimously felt that the achievements of several years of mutual aid production were fundamental. In agriculture, thanks to labor-saving mutual aid, not only was the management method improved and the technology improved, but also the cultivated area was expanded, more than 120 mu of wasteland was reclaimed, and the grain income was increased. When criticizing the shortcomings, Xiang Lai-gui said: "In the past, the group was too large, and it was really rigid to be unable to enter or exit freely. Some small work could have been done by myself, but I had to rely on mutual aid. This year, if we still use the small-scale mutual aid of last year, we will definitely be able to do it well." Xiang Tishui said: "This year's mutual aid must change the past practices. It is right to arrange one's own work. If you need mutual aid, you can help each other. Don't make it rigid." Comrade Tishui also made a self-criticism to the masses about certain undemocratic styles of leadership of the cadres in the past, and proposed that in future mutual aid, it is necessary to implement democratic voluntariness and mutual benefit, and conduct leadership according to everyone's opinions. On the basis of the masses having the consciousness of organizing mutual aid, Comrade Tishui grasped the minds of the masses and first researched a new method of rectifying mutual aid in the branch: first, it is necessary to overcome the past practice of holding large-scale rectification meetings, forcing the masses to make self-criticisms, and forcibly clearing their minds through administrative orders and formalism. Hold meetings of activists in production and other small meetings. Cadres and party members start from self-criticizing the undemocratic leadership in the past, conduct mutual aid policy education, and let the masses realize the importance of mutual aid from their own experiences. Then, let the masses voluntarily form groups. After the meeting, the masses looked for their own partners. Some were newly combined, some were freely entering and exiting on the original basis, some large groups were divided into small groups, and some remained the same. A craze for organizing mutual aid was formed. Now, 103 households have been combined into small groups, accounting for 68.5% of the total number of households in the village, and the rest are still continuing to consider partners and conduct matching.

    十里村整顿互助组
    简便灵活群众喜爱
    【太行电】壶关十里村劳动英雄向提水，根据群众喜爱简便灵活、出入自由的小型互助的经验，在充分发扬民主的基础上，有计划有领导的进行了互助整顿，给春耕生产以很大推动。该村互助组织是从一九四三年开始的，当时也和一般的互助组一样，在发展中逐渐形成“时时互助，事事集体”的固定形式，并吸收其它地方三大结合的经验，规定了一套复杂的折工记工及分红办法。到一九四八年整顿互助时，群众一致感到变工复杂，算帐麻烦，特别是强调集中做活，更为群众所不满。当时，向提水同志即根据群众意见改变了互助办法，组织成小型的互助形式，大家规定，除春耕、夏种、秋收等农忙季节的紧迫生活进行互助外，一般的生活，自己能干了的就不强调互助，若自己干不了或者愿意互助，就自愿碰起来，三人也行，五人也行。进行小型的互助活动。这样既不怕形成形式主义，也不自流，群众很满意。今年为了响应增产一成的号召，提水同志首先宣传党和政府的奖励群众生产发家的各种政策，以克服群众的思想顾虑，继即着手进行整顿互助。整顿的方法是：首先明确已往互助成绩，然后民主批判缺点，根据群众要求和亲身经验，进行自由碰组，经过群众回忆总结，一致感到几年的互助生产，成绩是基本的。在农业上，由于互助省工，不但改善了经营方法，提高了技术，而且扩大了耕地面积，开荒一百二十余亩，增加了粮食收入。批判缺点时，向来贵说：“过去组太大，出入不自由实在死板，有些小生活自己本来能干了，也非得互助不行，今年要还象去年小型互助一定能办好”。向提水说：“今年互助总得改变过去的做法，自己生活自己安排才对，需要互助就互助，不要弄成死的”。提水同志并向群众检讨了过去干部领导上的某些不民主作风，提出今后互助，一定要贯彻民主自愿、互助两利，根据大家意见，进行领导。在群众有了组织互助的自觉基础上，提水同志摸住群众心思，首先在支部研究出新的整顿互助方法：先要克服已往那种开大会整顿，硬让群众检讨、硬打通思想的行政命令与形式主义的做法，召开生产中的积极分子和其他小型会议，干部党员从检讨过去领导不民主入手，进行互助政策教育，让群众从切身的经验中体会互助的重要，然后让群众自愿碰组。会后，群众自找对象，有的是新结合，有的是在原有基础上自由出入，有的组大分成小组，有的仍照旧，组织互助形成热潮。现在已有一百零三户结合成小组，占全村总户数百分之六十八点五，其余仍继续考虑对象，进行碰合。
