Shijiazhuang No. 4 Power Plant

Improving Motors Increases Power Supply

[Shijiazhuang News] There is a power plant on the east side of the Fengshan Mine, which was led by Jingyang Coal Company before March 1st. After March 1st, it was taken over by Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company and named the Fourth Power Plant.

The plant has a total of four generators. The No. 1 generator has been dismantled. The No. 2 generator has the same model as the No. 1 generator, both of which are very old, and the power generation is extremely uneconomical. The No. 3 generator has also been in disrepair for many years and is full of problems. Only the No. 4 turbine generator with 1,200 kilowatts is relatively new, and the power generation is relatively economical. However, its power output cannot exceed one-half of the specified capacity. If it exceeds, the vacuum of the turbine will drop significantly. Therefore, in addition to the Fengshan Mine, mines such as Hengjian and Xin Well have to purchase electricity from Weisui.

After the Electric Light Company took over, it made every effort to thoroughly overhaul the machinery in the plant. Cleaning a 300-pound pressure Tianxiong boiler used to take at least 23 days, but this time it was completed in only 10 days. The turbine team also completed the task of overhauling all parts in a very short period. In addition to completing the plan, the electrical team also installed 28 signal lights and designed and manufactured two converters. In total, this power outage repair took only eleven and a half days, exceeding the original plan by one time.

The No. 4 turbine of the Fourth Plant was originally a bleed turbine dedicated to the silk factory. When using bleed steam, there is a steam pressure of 3.5 kilograms between its high-pressure steam blades and low-pressure steam blades. However, in our power plant, there is no need to bleed steam anymore, so this steam pressure should be eliminated. If it is maintained, it will reduce the vacuum and reduce the output of the motor. However, this bleed pressure has been maintained in the past, which is the main reason for the inability to generate a large amount of electricity.

After careful research by everyone, the low-pressure steam valve was opened thoroughly to reduce this bleed pressure to zero. When tested in this way, the output of the generator did increase.

After the major repair was completed, everyone believed that the conditions of all parts of the machinery were mature, so a full-load test was done with water resistance. When the motor load was increased to its specified capacity—1,200 kilowatts—the steam pressure and vacuum did not drop, and the operation of all parts of the machinery was also very good, only the temperature of the circulating water was a little high.

After the success of this experiment, electricity was sent to the North Mine, Xin Well, and various factories in the rear. What was previously worried about was that when one motor was started, the power would not be enough to distribute; but now the concern is that it cannot be used up and there is nowhere to distribute it. The main reason for this achievement is that the democratization of factory management has improved the enthusiasm of employees for creation, improvement, and active work. The Fourth Plant plans to thoroughly overhaul the old and sick No. 3 motor next month. After it is repaired, they also want it to operate in parallel with the No. 4 generator and send electricity to Shijiazhuang and Yangquan together. (Tan Ke)

    石家庄第四发电厂
    改良电机增加供电量
    【石市讯】在凤山矿东侧，有一个发电厂，该厂于三月一日以前还是由井阳煤业公司领导的，从三月一日以后，才由石家庄电灯公司接管过来，命名为第四发电厂。
    该厂共有四台发电机，一号机已经拆去，二号机和一号机的型式一样，都是非常陈旧的，发起电来极不经济。三号机也年久失修，浑身是病。只有一台一千二百基罗瓦特的四号透平式发电机，还比较新点，发电也比较经济。但它所出电力不能超过规定容量的二分之一，如果超过，汽机的真空就会显著的降下，因此除凤山矿外，横间、新井等矿就不得不购买微水的电了。
    电灯公司接管以后，对厂内各部机械，都以最大力量彻底检修。清洗一台三百磅压力的田熊式锅炉，过去最少需要二十三天，这次仅用十天就洗完了。汽机股也在极短的期间内完成了检修各部的任务。电气股除完成了计划以外，还装置了二十八个信号灯，并设计制作了两台变流器。总计这次停电修理，只用了十一天半的时间，超过原来计划一倍。
    四厂的四号汽机，原来是绢丝工厂专用的抽汽透平，应用抽汽时，在它的高压汽翼和低压汽翼之间存在着三。五公斤的蒸汽压力。但是在我们这个电厂里已经不需抽汽了，所以这个蒸汽压力就应当取消。设若继续保持，就会使真空降下而减低电机的出力。但过去却一直保持着这个抽汽压力，这就是不能大量发电的主因。
    经过大家缜密研究后，就将低压汽门开彻，使这抽汽压力降低至零，这样一试，果然发电机的出力增大了。
    大修理完成以后，大家都认为机械各部的条件都已经成熟了，于是就用水抵抗做了一个全负荷试验。当使电机负荷升高到它的规定容量——一二○○基罗瓦特——的时候，汽压和真空都不降下，各部机械的运转情形也非常良好，只是循环水的温度有点升高而已。
    这个实验成功后，就向北矿、新井以及后方各个工厂送电。从前所忧虑的是：开动一台电机，惟恐电力不够分配；而现在则惟恐用不完，没处分配了。这种成就主要的原因是：工厂管理民主化，提高了职工们创造改良和积极工作的情绪。四厂计划在下月彻底检修那台年老多病的三号电机。修好以后还想叫它和四号机并列运转，一同向石家庄及阳泉送电。      （檀可）
