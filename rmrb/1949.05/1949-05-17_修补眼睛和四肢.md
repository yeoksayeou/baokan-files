　　Repairing Eyes and Limbs
    To the Editor: 1. Are there any hospitals in the liberated areas that repair eyes and limbs? 2. I saw in your newspaper (February 19th) that the Soviet Union has invented a method for repairing eyeballs. I wonder if there are any hospitals in the liberated areas that offer such repairs?
  　Wang Wenzhu, Pingtimg County, Jinzhong First District
    Answer: China does not yet have hospitals like the Soviet Union that repair eyeballs. In the liberated areas (such as Beijing, Tianjin, etc.), there are hospitals that repair eyes and limbs, but they are mostly for aesthetic purposes and rarely for practical use. As for the cost, it depends on the patient's condition (such as what materials, methods, and procedures are needed).

　　修补眼睛和四肢
    编辑同志：一、解放区现有无补修眼、四肢的医院？二、前见贵报（二月十九日）所载，知苏联有补修眼珠的发明，不悉解放区现是否已有这样施补的医院？
  　晋中一分区平定县王文珠
    答：如苏联那种补修眼珠的医院，中国现在还没有。在解放区（如平、津等地）有补修眼、四肢的医院，但都只是以美观出发，少有实用；至需价若干，得视患者的情况（如需什么材料、方法、手续等）而定。
