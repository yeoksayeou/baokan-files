　　Amidst Drought Relief Efforts, Welcome Rain
　　Plentiful Rainfall in Pingzhou Yesterday

　　[This newspaper dispatch] As drought relief movements unfold throughout North China, welcome plentiful rainfall occurred near Beiping yesterday. According to the Meteorological Observatory: from 4:18 AM to 5:13 AM yesterday morning, there was a period of thunderstorms. From 9:30 AM, rain began again. By 11:00 AM, within one and a half hours, the rainfall had already reached 4 millimeters. It rained until 5:00 PM in the afternoon. According to observations, the scope of this rainfall is very wide, and Shandong and Hebei are likely to receive rain as well. The reason for the rainfall is: a relatively deep modified air mass (high temperature) over the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea of China provided water vapor; at the same time, another air mass (low temperature) in Northwest China, with different properties from the first, is encountering the first air mass in the Beiping area, causing disturbances and rainfall.

　　抗旱声中  喜逢甘霖
  　平周昨降透雨
    【本报讯】华北各地普遍展开抗旱运动声中，北平附近昨日喜降透雨。据气象台消息：昨晨四时十八分至五时十三分，曾有一度雷雨。九时三十分起，再度降雨。至上午十一时，一点半钟内，降雨量已有四公厘。下午下至五时。据观测：这次下雨范围非常广泛，山东、河北均可能落雨。降雨原因是：日本海与中国黄海有一变性较深气团（气温高），供给了水气；同时中国西北另有一气团（气温低），两气团性质不同，正在北平一带相遇，发生扰动而降雨。　　　（仲）
