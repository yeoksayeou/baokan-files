    Waste of Civilian Labor at the Jianping No. 3 Grain Depot
    County Government Investigated and Dealt With
    [Our Newspaper] Regarding the waste of manpower and animal power at the Jianping County No. 3 Grain Depot (see page 2 of this newspaper, March 19th), the North China People's Supervisory Court previously sent a letter to the Jianping County Government to thoroughly investigate the truth of the matter and pursue responsibility. The Jianping County Government has now conducted a review of this matter and reported the handling situation to the North China People's Government. On the 4th of this month, the North China People's Government instructed the Jianping County Government to punish those responsible for the incident as follows: (1) Since Luo Rufeng, the accountant of the No. 3 Grain Depot, has already gone south, the original decision by the county government to dismiss him will be changed to a major demerit, and his mistake will be published in the newspaper. (2) Dong, the director of the No. 3 Grain Depot, knew that Luo Rufeng's work style was usually careless. He did not seriously check and supervise Luo Rufeng's handling of the grass transportation date and did not fulfill his final responsibility. Liu Jushan, the director of the county grain depot, only relied on Luo Rufeng's one-sided statement regarding this matter, without conducting a thorough investigation, and reflected untrue information to the county committee. Therefore, Dong and Liu will be given a criticism punishment separately. Although the county's leading organs also have a responsibility, they have conducted a deep review, recognized their mistakes, and will not be punished further. According to the lunar calendar on December 8th last year, a certain organization sent people through the county armed forces department to the No. 3 Grain Depot to negotiate the transportation of grass. At that time, the director of the grain depot was not at home, so Luo Rufeng agreed with the people from a certain organization that the 11th, 12th, and 13th would be the dates for transporting the grass. Once Luo agreed, he should have immediately written a letter to inform the county armed forces department, but although he wrote a letter, he neither gave it to the people from a certain organization to take back to the county armed forces department, nor did he send someone to deliver it. Instead, he assumed that the people from a certain organization would inform the county armed forces department, and the county armed forces department would confirm the date and send him a letter. However, when the director of the grain depot asked him on the evening of the 8th whether the grass transportation date had been negotiated with the county armed forces department, Luo Rufeng actually said that it had been negotiated and there were no problems. Luo Rufeng, on the one hand, agreed on the date of grass transportation, and on the other hand, he believed that the county armed forces department's mobilization of livestock "saying that the grass would be transported on the 11th, would not even reach the departure point on the 12th" (Luo's words), and therefore made no preparations. As a result, when the manpower and animal power mobilized by the county armed forces department arrived at the No. 3 Grain Depot on time on the 11th, the grass could not be transported, wasting the labor of the masses. After the incident, Luo Rufeng did not conduct a deep review and showed a nonchalant attitude. This is a mistake caused by Luo Rufeng's consistent careless, irresponsible, and sloppy work style, which damaged the interests of the people.
    The county government pointed out in the review report that Luo Rufeng should bear the main responsibility for this matter, and the county armed forces department had no responsibility. At the same time, it was reviewed that the county's leading organs had not inquired or investigated this matter for a long time, which showed a bureaucratic work style and insufficient spirit of being responsible to the people. After the criticism was raised in the newspaper, they reflected untrue information to the Party newspaper, which further showed their careless and unconcerned attitude towards handling problems and a lack of a realistic approach. The county government also decided that the manpower and animal power wasted this time should not be for nothing, and the transportation station should compensate for the work.

    建屏第三粮库浪费民力事
    县府已检查处理
    【本报讯】关于建屏县第三粮库浪费人畜力一事（见三月十九日本报第二版），前经华北人民监察院函建屏县府澈查事实真象，追究责任，现建屏县府已对此事进行检讨，并将处理情形报告华北人民政府。本月四日华北人民政府指令建屏县府，对该事件应负责任者分别处分如下：（一）第三粮库会计罗如风既已南下，着将县府原定撤职处分改为记大过一次，并将其错误登报。（二）第三粮库董主任既知罗如风素日作风马虎，对罗如风此次经手商定运草日期未认真检查督促，没有尽到最后责任；县粮库主任刘具山对此事仅以罗如风一面之词，不加深刻调查，即向县委反映了不真实的情况。因此对董刘二人分别给予批评处分。至该县领导机关虽亦有责任，但已做深刻检讨，认识了错误，不再处分。按去年阴历十二月八日，某机关派人经由县武装部到第三粮库接洽运草事宜。当时该粮库主任不在家，即由罗如风与某机关来人约定好了十一、十二、十三，三日为运草日期。罗既竟约定就应马上写信告知县武装部，但他虽写了一信，却既未交给某机关来人带回给县武装部，亦未派人送去，反以为某机关来人会向县武装部讲知，县武装部会确定日期给他来信。但当八日晚粮库董主任问他运草日期是否和县武装部谈妥，罗如风竟说谈妥了，没有问题了。罗如风一方面约定运草日期，一方面又自认为县武装部动员牲口“说着十一日运草，十二日也到不了起运点”（罗语），因之毫无准备。致使县武装部动员的人畜力于十一日按时到第三粮库时，草却不能起运，浪费了群众的劳力。事情发生后，罗如风不做深刻检讨，表现满不在乎，这是罗如风工作上一贯吊儿浪当，不负责任，粗枝大叶所造成损害人民利益的错误。
    县府于检讨报告中指明这件事应由罗如风负主要责任，县武装部没有什么责任的。同时检讨到县领导机关对这件事情发生很久，不过问不追究，表现了官僚主义作风，为人民负责的精神不够。在报纸提出批评后，又给党报反映了不真实的情况，这更表现了对处理问题粗枝大叶，不细心，缺乏实事求是的态度。县府并决定对此次浪费的人畜力，不能让群众白出，应该由交通站给顶上工。
