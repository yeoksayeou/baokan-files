【News from Central Hebei】Drought and strong winds have damaged seedlings in the black saline-alkali villages of the Second and Fifth Districts of Qingyuan. Many cotton seedlings planted by both drilling and dibbling methods withered before they could even emerge. In some cases, this was due to carelessness in covering the soil during dibbling. The black soil is dense, and the cotton shoots could not break through the hard cover, so they dried out after a couple of days. According to a survey in Beixin Village, Fifth District, out of more than 100 mu of cotton planted, 21 mu had half of their seedlings missing. In the northern part of the Second District, many cotton seedlings also withered after emerging. At the same time, cotton and peanuts planted on the sandy soil along the Tang River were also damaged by the wind. Some peanuts were blown out of the ground, and if left unattended for a day, they would wither and die. These disasters affected the masses' confidence in watering and planting.

Two Methods for Preserving Seedlings

The Party committees of the First, Second, and Fifth Districts, based on this situation, proposed watering to preserve seedlings. Zhang Zhijia, a village cadre in Beixin Village, Fifth District, planted three mu of cotton. Two mu were missing half of their seedlings. He organized the women and children in his family to replant them in one day. The 21 mu of cotton with severe seedling loss in the village were replanted in three days. In Zhongran Village, out of 1,000 mu of cotton, more than 90 mu were missing two-thirds of their seedlings. The masses wanted to destroy the fields and plant other crops. After the explanation by district and village cadres, they persuaded the farmers, who are now carrying water to replant the seedlings. In Yangzhuang Village, Second District, some of the cotton seedlings in the irrigated land that could not emerge were given a "covering irrigation". The Party committees of the First and Second Districts quickly organized the masses to inspect the cotton and peanut fields damaged by the wind. They re-watered and covered the exposed peanut seedlings and replanted the cotton that had been blown to death, boosting the masses' confidence in planting.

The masses have created two methods for preserving seedlings. One is faster, involving "covering irrigation" in irrigated land. After watering, the soil is broken up with an iron rake the next day to loosen it and prevent the seedlings from being crushed. The second method is slower, suitable for black soil that cannot be irrigated directly. It involves digging small trenches around the cotton plants and watering them. This ensures that no seedlings are easily lost. The basic method is to water more heavily when planting and to select good seeds to reduce seedling loss.

　　天旱风多伤幼苗
  　清苑保苗补种
    【冀中讯】天旱风多在清苑二区、五区之黑咸地村庄，点种耩种的棉花，有不少棉苗不等露出头来就枯死了。一部是因点种盖土不留心，黑土质性紧，棉芽拱不动硬盖，芽出不来，过两天就干死。据调查五区北辛庄种一百多亩棉花，缺苗二分之一的，就有二十一亩。在二区北部棉苗出来被干枯死的也很多。同时在唐河两岸沙土地点种上的棉花、花生，被风刮坏的也不少。有些花生刮的露出来，如一天不管就要枯死。这些灾害影响了群众挑水点种的信心。
  　保苗的两种方法
    一、二、五区区委根据此种情况，提出浇水保苗，五区北辛庄村干部张志家种了三亩棉花。有二亩缺一半苗，他组织了家中娘们孩子，一天就点补好了。该村二十一亩缺苗严重的棉花，三天就补种全了。中冉村一千亩棉花有九十多亩缺三分之二的苗，群众要毁了种别的庄稼，经区村干部的解释。说服了农民现正挑水点种补苗。二区羊庄村对出不来的水浇地棉花，有的上蒙头水。一、二区被风刮坏的棉花、花生，区委都迅速组织群众到地中检查，对露出来的花生芽进行二次浇水盖土，被刮死的棉花进行补种，鼓舞了群众点种信心。
    在群众保苗中创造了两种办法。一种是比较快的，在水浇地浇蒙头水。浇后一天用铁耙将地皮划破，使土轻松，压不死苗。第二种是较慢的，适合于黑土地质点种不能浇的，是在棉棵周围挖小沟浇水，这样苗好出来。要不轻易瞎一棵苗。基本的方法是种时浇水大些，选好种籽使缺苗减少。　　　（田原、晨光）
