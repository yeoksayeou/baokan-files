Employees of the Pingjin Railway Bureau
Actively Improve Transportation Work
Travel Time Greatly Reduced

[This newspaper’s dispatch] To celebrate May Day Labor Day, the employees of the Pingjin Railway Bureau and its affiliated units have intensified their work since the last transportation meeting, resulting in five significant improvements in railway transportation: (1) Summer train schedules have been established, significantly reducing travel time. The special express train from Beiping to Tianjin, which took three hours and five minutes before May Day, has been shortened to two hours and twenty-five minutes after May Day, two minutes faster than the fastest travel speed during the Kuomintang rule. The speed of other general trains, both passenger and freight, has also been increased. (2) Direct express trains from Beiping to Shenyang began operating on May Day, and the travel time has also been reduced. One express train takes twenty-six hours and twelve minutes from Beiping to Shenyang, and another takes twenty-seven hours and seventeen minutes. Currently, there are two pairs of trains operating daily between Beiping and Shenyang. (3) Reserved-seat express trains between Pingjin have been restored, ensuring that passengers have guaranteed seats. The number of special express trains has been increased from three pairs to four pairs, and there are also four pairs of ordinary express trains. In total, there are now ten daily round-trip trains, making transportation much more convenient than in the past. (4) The responsible parcel system has been restored. If there is any damage or loss, the railway bureau is responsible for compensation at the local market price on that day or for purchasing the original item. (5) Less-than-carload (LCL) freight transportation has been restored. Previously, the railway bureau stipulated that freight not filling a full car would be charged as parcels. Now, it is charged as ordinary LCL freight, reducing freight charges. As a result of the above five improvements, passengers find it convenient.

    平津铁路局员工
    积极改进运输工作
    行车时间大见缩短
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局所属员工，为庆祝“五一”劳动节，自上次运输会议以后即加紧工作，使铁路运输获得五项重要改进：（一）规定夏季行车时刻，使行车时间大大缩短。北平到天津的特别快车，“五一”以前是三点零五分，“五一”以后缩短到两点二十五分，比国民党统治时最高行车速度快两分钟。其他一般列车、客货车都提高了速度。（二）从“五一”起开始实行了由北平到沈阳的直达快车，时间也缩短了。有一列快车由北平到沈阳二十六小时十二分，另有一列车行车时间二十七小时十七分。目前每天两对北平、沈阳对开。（三）恢复平津间的对号快车，保证了旅客都有一定座位。且将三对特别快车增加到四对，此外还有四对普通快车。共计现在每天有十次对开列车，交通已比过去大大便利。（四）恢复了负责包裹制。如有损坏或遗失，由铁路局负责按当天当地的市价赔偿或买给原物。（五）恢复零担货运。本来铁路局规定，货运不满大整车的按包裹纳费，现在按普通零担收费，货运收费一为减低。由于以上五项改进，旅客称便。
