　　British Imperialists in Singapore Restrict Patriotic Activities of Overseas Chinese
  　China Democratic League Issues Strong Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st] The headquarters of the China Democratic League issued the following statement on the 19th of this month regarding the Singapore British government's ban on activities of the China Democratic League:
    According to Singapore dispatches, the British government there has ordered a ban on the activities of foreign political organizations, including the China Democratic League. The China Democratic League has established branches in Singapore and Malaya for more than three years. Our overseas branches have always adhered to the headquarters' policies and guidelines, aiming to engage in the patriotic movement of overseas Chinese and promote democracy and peace in the motherland, and have never interfered in local politics. After the war, the British government in Singapore allowed overseas Chinese the freedom of political activity. The China Democratic League in Singapore was once recognized by the British government as a legitimate political organization and did not need to apply for registration as an ordinary social organization. Now, the Singapore authorities have abandoned the promise made after the war to guarantee the people's democratic freedoms and have banned the League's activities. In fact, this is a deprivation of the freedom of patriotic activities for overseas Chinese. Recently, British imperialism has adopted a reactionary anti-Chinese policy in Malaya, arresting overseas Chinese democrats and deporting large numbers of overseas Chinese. Now, it has banned overseas Chinese from political activities related to their motherland. The League cannot help but raise a serious protest once again, and urge peace-loving democrats at home and abroad, especially in Britain, to pay attention and rise up to stop this unreasonable and reactionary measure. We are deeply concerned about the overseas Chinese and League members who are suffering from imperialist oppression and have lost their freedom to be patriotic. The victory of the liberation of all the Chinese people is about to arrive. A new China that is peaceful, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong will surely fight for the deserved status and democratic freedoms for overseas Chinese.
    Interim Working Committee of the Headquarters of the China Democratic League, May 19, 1949.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st] According to Singapore dispatches: On the 9th of this month, the British government in Singapore ordered a ban on the activities of foreign political organizations. The China Democratic League, which originally had branches in Singapore, must reapply for registration as an ordinary social organization. However, the conditions for applying for registration as an ordinary social organization are very harsh. According to the Malayan Societies Registration Ordinance, it is generally extremely difficult for organizations of a political nature to obtain approval. Therefore, this measure by British imperialism is effectively equivalent to canceling the due right of overseas Chinese to engage in patriotic political activities. The China Democratic League established an office in Singapore in April 1946, and established branches and sub-branches in various parts of Malaya, with thousands of League members. Its purpose was to support the motherland's peaceful and democratic movement and did not interfere in local politics. It was once announced by the British government as a legitimate political organization. Recently, the British government has adopted various abusive methods against our overseas Chinese compatriots, deporting large numbers of overseas Chinese. Now, it has banned the activities of the China Democratic League, causing our overseas Chinese compatriots in Singapore to lose their freedom to engage in patriotic activities, which further proves the reactionary nature of British imperialist colonial policy. While the British government in Singapore has banned the activities of the China Democratic League, it has also superficially banned the activities of the Kuomintang's overseas branches. However, people believe that this is only a deceptive trick, because British imperialism will continue to secretly use the Kuomintang reactionaries, who have always colluded with it, to frame patriotic and democratic elements among overseas Chinese.

　　星洲英帝限制侨胞爱国活动
  　民主同盟严重抗议
    【新华社北平二十一日电】中国民主同盟总部于本月十九日就新加坡英国政府禁止民盟活动事，发表声明如下：
    据新加坡电讯，该地英国政府命令禁止外国政治团体活动，包括中国民主同盟在内。查中国民主同盟在新加坡及马来亚建立支部分部，已有三年以上的历史。本盟海外支部向来遵守总部政策方针，以从事华侨爱国运动，促成祖国民主和平为目的，从未干涉当地政治。新加坡英政府战后允许华侨有政治活动的自由权利。本盟在新加坡曾经英政府承认为合法政治团体，不必申请注册作为普通社团。现在新加坡当局，竟背弃在战后所作保障人民民主自由权利的诺言，禁止本盟活动。事实上是剥夺华侨爱国活动的自由权利。最近英帝国主义在马来亚采取反动的排华政策，逮捕华侨民主人士，大批驱逐华侨出境，现在又禁止华侨对祖国政治的活动。本盟不能不再度提出严重抗议，并促请国内外尤其是英国的爱好和平民主人士加以注意，起来阻止这一无理的反动措施。对于遭受帝国主义压迫，失去爱国自由的华侨及盟员同志，我们不胜关怀。全中国人民解放的胜利不久就要到来。和平民主统一富强的新中国，一定要替海外侨胞，争取应得的地位和民主自由的权利的。
    中国民主同盟总部临时工作委员会　一九四九年五月十九日
    【新华社北平二十一日电】据新加坡电讯：新加坡英国政府于本月九日命令禁止外国政治团体活动，其原在新加坡设有支部的中国民主同盟，则须重行申请登记，作为普通社团。但普通社团申请登记，条件十分苛刻。依照马来亚社团注册法令，政治性质的团体大抵极难获得核准。所以英帝国主义这一措施，实际上等于取消华侨从事爱国政治活动的应有权利。按中国民主同盟于一九四六年四月在新加坡成立办事处，在马来亚各地建立分部、区分部，有盟员数千人，其目的在支援祖国和平民主运动，并未干预当地政治，曾经英政府公布承认其为合法政治团体。最近英国政府对我侨胞采取种种虐待办法，大批驱逐华侨出境，现在又禁止民盟的活动，使我侨胞在新加坡失去爱国活动的自由，愈益证明英帝国主义殖民地政策的反动性质。新加坡英政府在禁止民盟活动，同时表面上也禁止国民党海外支部活动，但人们都相信这只是一种欺骗作用，因为英帝国主义将继续在暗中利用素来与它狼狈为奸的国民党反动派，来陷害华侨中的爱国民主分子。
