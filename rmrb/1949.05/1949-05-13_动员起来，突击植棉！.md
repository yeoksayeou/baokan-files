    Mobilize, Surge Forward with Cotton Planting!
    Currently, under the slogan of "Planting one day earlier means ripening ten days earlier," various regions have achieved considerable results. For example, in some areas of eastern Hebei, 50 to 80 percent of the fields have been sown. Some regions, such as Luannan County, have completed all planting, and Yutian's Third District has exceeded the assigned cotton planting task by more than 200 mu. In central Hebei, southern Hebei, and Chahar Province, large numbers of capable cadres have been sent to the countryside to specifically help the masses solve planting difficulties and organize them to dig earthen wells and carry water for spot sowing. Incomplete statistics from 28 counties in central Hebei alone show that more than 10,000 earthen wells have been dug, ensuring timely sowing for more than 100,000 mu of land. This proves that the broad masses of peasants in our liberated areas can overcome all difficulties and defeat the drought. In order to truly guarantee the complete realization of the agricultural production increase plan for the entire region, especially the 100 percent completion of the cotton planting task, in the short ten days before the Lesser Fullness solar term, leaders at all levels must not have the slightest slackness or ideas of luck or waiting for rain. Areas where it has not rained should make another effort, continue to implement the spirit of carrying water for spot sowing, and ensure the completion of the task. Areas where it has rained, especially cotton-producing areas such as Tianjin and Beijing, should strive even harder to exceed the task.
    Therefore, we once again call on all Party, government, military, and civilian personnel in the entire region to put aside all non-urgent matters and regard the surge planting of cotton as the current central task. Mobilize all labor and animal power, and widely organize labor mutual aid. All rural agencies, troops, organizations, and schools should also participate in assisting with cultivation and sowing, striving to complete the region's cotton planting plan.

    动员起来，突击植棉！
    目前各地在“早种一天早熟十天”的号召下，已取得不少成绩。如冀东部分地区已完成播种大田的百分之五十到八十，有的地区如滦南县已全部完成，玉田三区已超过布置植棉任务二百余亩。冀中、冀南、察省都派大批得力干部下乡，具体帮助群众解决播种困难，组织群众挖土井、担水点种。仅冀中二十八个县不完全的统计，已挖土井一万余眼，可保证十多万亩土地及时下种。这证明我解放区广大农民能够克服一切困难，战胜旱灾。为切实保证全区农业增产计划的全部实现，特别是植棉任务的百分之百的完成，在这距小满节仅有紧迫的十天当中，我们各级领导上绝不应有毫丝的松懈、侥幸等雨的思想。未落雨的地区，要再努一把力，继续贯彻担水点种的精神，保证完成任务。已落雨的地区，特别平津等产棉区，更要积极努力争取超过任务。
    因此，我们再度号召全区党政军民，应放下一切不急之务，把突击播种棉花当作目前中心工作。动员一切劳力畜力，广泛组织劳动互助。所有农村机关部队团体学校，亦应参加助耕下种，争取全区植棉计划的完成。
