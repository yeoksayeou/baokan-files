Questions and Answers on the Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region (Continued 1)
Part Three: On Tax Exemption Points and Deduction of Livestock Consumption
Q: Why is it necessary to deduct tax exemption points?
A: Deducting tax exemption points is to adjust the burden balance between rich and poor regions and to take care of the production and living difficulties of poor households.

Q: Who can deduct tax exemption points? How is it deducted?
A: 1.  The actual number of family members living at home who rely on agricultural income, regardless of gender or age, can deduct one tax exemption point per person in their household. 2. Revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary workers on the supply system, as well as martyrs, can deduct one tax exemption point in their own homes. 3. Female workers who have left production and get married can deduct in their husband's or parents' home, depending on their preference, but there must be a formal notice from their organization; without a formal notice, the deduction is made in the husband's home. 4. Those who rely on rotational care for their livelihood can have the tax exemption point deducted through consultation with the person responsible for the rotational care. 5. Those who reside in other people's homes year-round can have the deduction made in the home where they reside. 6. The tax exemption points for hired workers are calculated and deducted separately based on the length of time they eat at the employer's home and their own home. However, temporary short-term workers are not deducted in their employer's home. 7. Those who are away from home year-round but whose living expenses are entirely supplied by the family's agricultural income (such as self-funded students, individual military cadre family members, etc.) can have the deduction made in their own home.

Q: Who cannot deduct tax exemption points?
A: 1. Those who are away from home year-round earning a living (such as craftsmen, shop assistants, etc.) and are not supported by their families. 2. Those who engage in industry and commerce and whose living expenses have already been deducted in the industry and commerce burden. 3. Those whose land is scattered in several places and whose tax exemption points have already been deducted elsewhere. 4. Revolutionary workers on a salary system (including teachers and staff on a salary system, and staff in state-owned enterprises, etc.), and workers and staff on a wage system, etc. 5. Students on public funding (half-funded students should still deduct half a tax exemption point at home).

Q: How are tax exemptions deducted for households engaged in both agriculture and industry/commerce?
A: The tax exemption can be appropriately deducted based on the proportion of the family's annual agricultural income to the family's total annual income, after democratic assessment by the appraisal committee.

Q: How are tax exemption points deducted for widowed, orphaned, and disabled households and families of military personnel, workers, and martyrs who have no labor force and are in financial difficulties?
A: After assessment by the village government and approval by the county government, their tax exemption points may be appropriately increased.

Q: Why is it necessary to deduct livestock consumption? Which livestock are deducted? How much is deducted?
A: In order to encourage production and livestock breeding, it is stipulated that all livestock used for cultivating land and their offspring shall be deducted for consumption (livestock used for transportation, sales, and slaughter shall not be deducted). Cattle and donkeys are deducted by 0.4 standard mu (equivalent to four shi dou of grain) per head, and mules and horses are deducted by 0.7 standard mu (equivalent to seven shi dou of grain) per head.

Part Four: On Burden Mu, Burden Amount, Collection, and Tax Reduction
Q: What is a "burden mu"? How much is the burden per mu?
A: "Burden mu" is the tax calculation unit in the new tax regulations. After deducting tax exemption points and livestock consumption from each household's total standard mu, the remaining standard mu is the household's total burden mu. Each burden mu is levied with 25 shi jin of millet as public grain per year, and local grain funds (including village grain funds) are additionally levied by the provincial government or administrative office, with the approval of the North China People's Government, within a range not exceeding five shi jin of millet per burden mu.

Q: How can fixed burden per burden mu be implemented?
A: It is necessary to conduct a true survey of the total land area and its output, population, and livestock in the county, and the county government shall prepare two copies of the agricultural tax register, which shall be submitted to the administrative office (or provincial/municipal government) and the North China People's Government for verification. Only after approval by the North China People's Government can fixed burden per burden mu be implemented. However, before the land area and output are accurately assessed, the burden amount must still be uniformly adjusted and allocated by the government above the county level.

Q: What items are collected?
A: In order to protect war supplies and implement the policy of military needs from the people, in addition to collecting millet and wheat, a portion of coarse grains, cash, military shoes, cotton, homespun cloth, firewood, and other materials may also be converted and collected.

Q: What happens to the burden in years of natural disasters?
A: In the event of waterlogging, drought, insect pests, hailstorms, or other disasters, resulting in crop failures and difficulties in bearing the burden, the county government may conduct an investigation, report the disaster situation in detail to the provincial government (or administrative office) and submit it to the North China People's Government for verification. It may be possible to postpone, reduce, or exempt the tax.
