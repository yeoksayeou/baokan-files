    [This Newspaper Reports] Yesterday (the 5th) was the fourth day of the North China Workers' Representative Conference. Comrade Liu Shaoqi attended and spoke, receiving enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. He first conveyed the respect of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the conference and then gave incisive and detailed explanations on several issues in the proposals of the conference representatives. Regarding the issue of wartime industry transforming into peacetime industry, he said: Due to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, North China, which has become the rear of the war, now has the possibility to begin construction work and develop industrial and agricultural production. This requires a planned and step-by-step transformation of the industry established in wartime and serving the war into peacetime industry. He reminded everyone that this is a very complex and difficult task, and that government enterprise departments and various production departments should draw up specific plans, consult and study with workers, and propose appropriate implementation methods. Regarding the planning of state-owned enterprises, Comrade Shaoqi believed that state-owned enterprises must have plans, and overall plans at that. However, such unified plans cannot be formulated at present. Therefore, various industrial departments and factories should formulate their own plans based on their own circumstances, and then, on this basis, formulate overall plans. Regarding the democratization of factory management, he said: In the process of formulating production plans, the factory directors and managers of each factory must inform the trade union of the true situation of the entire production process and allow the workers to discuss and propose amendments before finalizing and implementing them. He believes that all public factories should uniformly organize factory management committees (newly taken-over factories where conditions are not yet ripe may be slightly slower) and workers' representative conferences (factories with fewer than two or three hundred people may not establish them). Managers or factory directors should submit all major issues within the factory to the management committee and the representative conference for discussion. Comrade Shaoqi said that in the factories of the old liberated areas, a prepared and led movement for the democratization of factory management should be carried out, with criticism and self-criticism, to change the bureaucratic tendencies existing in some factories. He particularly emphasized that in the movement, responsible comrades should first conduct self-criticism. Regarding the issue of wages and benefits, he suggested using several methods to ensure the supply of material goods to workers. When talking about trade union organization, he said that we should now think about how to organize the nearly 20 million workers across the country according to industry and occupation, and propose several specific methods. He also said that members must pay membership dues and trade unions should have independent funding. Finally, he called on the working class to study hard and improve themselves, hoping that a large number of outstanding workers will participate in the people's government, factories, armies, and various departments to do leadership work.

    华北工代会议第四天
    刘少奇同志讲话
    国营企业要订出全盘生产计划  工人阶级要努力学习提高自己
    【本报讯】昨日（五日）为华北职工代表会议之第四日，刘少奇同志亲临讲话，全场鼓掌热烈欢迎。他首先代表中共中央向大会致敬，接着对大会代表提案中若干问题，作了精辟详尽的说明。关于战时工业转变为平时工业问题，他说：由于解放军迅速推进，成为战争后方的华北，已经有可能来开始建设工作，发展工农业生产。这就需要有计划有步骤地，把战争情况下建立起来并为战争服务的工业，转化为平时工业。他提醒大家说：这是一件很复杂很艰难的工作，政府企业部和各生产部门，应拟出具体计划，并和工人商量研究，提出妥善实施办法。关于国营企业的计划性问题，少奇同志认为：国营企业必须要有计划，而且要全盘的计划。但这种统一计划，目前还不可能订出，因此，各产业部门和各工厂，应根据自己的情况订出各种门各工厂自己的计划，然后，在这一基础上，订出全盘计划。关于工厂管理民主化问题，他说：在制订生产计划当中，各厂的厂长经理，必须把生产全部过程的真实情况，告诉工会，并让工人进行讨论，提出修正意见，然后再确定执行。他认为：所有的公营工厂，应一律组织工厂管理委员会（新接管工厂，条件尚未成熟的，可稍慢些）和职工代表会议（二三百人以下的工厂可不建立），经理或厂长应将厂内一切重大问题，提到管委会和代表大会上去讨论。少奇同志说：在老解放区的工厂，要进行一个有准备、有领导的工厂管理民主化的运动，展开批评和自我批评，以改变某些工厂存在的官僚主义倾向。他特别强调在运动中，负责同志应当首先进行自我批评，关于工资待遇问题，他建议用若干办法保证工人的实物供给。谈到工会组织问题时，他说：现在就应当想到怎样把全国近二千万工人按产业与职业的划分组织起来，并提出若干具体办法。他还说：会员必须缴纳会费，工会应有独立经费。最后，他号召工人阶级，努力学习，提高自己，希望有大批优秀工人参加人民政府、工厂、军队及各部门做领导工作。
