Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th: TASS Vienna Dispatch: On the 11th, Viennese workers held a demonstration outside the old city hall, protesting against the reactionary trade union leaders who were discussing administrative increases in prices, transport fares, and taxes inside the city hall. They also expressed their indignation at the foreign ruling groups' intention to further worsen the already difficult situation of the working people. Demonstrators held up banners and chanted slogans, demanding that the trade union leaders unconditionally violate the people's "price and wage agreement." The demonstration broke through heavy police barriers and gathered in the square opposite the city hall to hold a meeting. The vice-chairman of the Trade Union Federation and member of the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, Yala, delivered a speech stating that the Communist Party would resolutely fight against the reactionary派's new attempts to infringe upon the rights and interests of the working people. A representative of the left-wing Social Democrats then spoke, also strongly protesting against the anti-people collusion of the ruling parties.
