　　On the Management of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies
    Xue Muqiao
    To establish a sound and independent economic system, we must establish a sound and independent monetary system.

    The "Legal Tender" issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government was controlled by American and British imperialism from the very beginning. As a result, China's finance, fiscal affairs, and even other economic undertakings had to be directly or indirectly dominated by American and British imperialism. In recent years, the Kuomintang reactionary government frantically issued banknotes at an alarming rate to carry out a frenzied plunder of the broad masses of the people. As a result, the currency value plummeted and prices soared. To salvage its extremely serious economic crisis, the Kuomintang reactionary government changed from "Legal Tender" to "Customs Gold Units," to "Gold Yuan," and recently claimed that it would change the "Gold Yuan" into some kind of "Silver Yuan." However, its credibility has become lower and lower, and now it has completely collapsed. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the "Gold Yuan" has been rejected by the people everywhere in the market, and even government agencies such as post offices and telegraph offices have refused to accept the "Gold Yuan." What replaces the "Gold Yuan" in market circulation are gold bars, silver dollars, and foreign currencies such as US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. The Kuomintang's monetary system has completely collapsed, and its economic system has also completely collapsed, not to mention any "independence."

    The People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, in the areas they reach, are first faced with an urgent problem: how to clean up the completely chaotic and completely corrupt currency market left by the Kuomintang reactionary government. We must quickly issue People's Currency to protect economic development and protect the interests of the people to replace the "Gold Yuan" that has been abandoned by the people. There is not much difficulty in this at present. Because the "Gold Yuan" has been abandoned by the people, as soon as any area is liberated, the "Gold Yuan" immediately becomes waste paper. It no longer has the slightest power to hinder the issuance and wide circulation of People's Currency. However, if we do not manage the gold, silver, and various foreign currencies that replace the "Gold Yuan" in the market, and allow them to flood the market, they will often become a serious obstacle to our establishment of a sound and independent monetary system. Because the occupation of the market by gold, silver, and foreign currencies will not only hinder the issuance and wide circulation of People's Currency; but also, due to the speculation of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, it is easy to cause drastic fluctuations in prices. If our market is thus thrown into a state of chaos, economic recovery and development will encounter difficulties. The reason for this is self-evident.

    Gold and silver were not originally important materials in people's lives, but because they have been used as a medium of exchange for thousands of years, a mysterious concept has arisen in people's minds. They are worshiped like idols. Therefore, when the Kuomintang reactionary government used violent inflation to carry out a frenzied plunder of the people, it was a very natural phenomenon for the people to store gold and silver in order to avoid the losses caused by inflation. Especially silver dollars, which have been the standard currency of China for a long time, are more likely to circulate in the market. However, now that we have driven out the "Gold Yuan," issued People's Currency, and ensured that the currency value and prices are relatively stable, the circulation of gold and silver in the market is not only unnecessary, but has become an important factor in shaking prices, disrupting the market, and undermining our monetary system. General speculators do not engage in legitimate production, but specialize in the speculative buying and selling of gold and silver. Because gold and silver themselves do not have much use value, and their supply and demand are also quite limited. Therefore, the speculative buying and selling of gold and silver will inevitably cause drastic fluctuations in the prices of gold and silver, and thus affect the stability of general prices. The fact that each price fluctuation in the market in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is often led by the rise in gold and silver can prove this. Therefore, although the People's Government does not oppose the people's storage of gold and silver, it cannot but strictly prohibit the planned exercise or speculative buying and selling of gold and silver. We must never obey the interests of a few speculators and hinder the stability of the market and the people's lives.

    The widespread circulation of foreign currencies such as US dollars and Hong Kong dollars in the Chinese market, and in some areas even exceeding the "Gold Yuan" and becoming the main currency like silver dollars, is even more a phenomenon peculiar to colonial countries. It is also the evil consequence of the Kuomintang reactionary government's years of traitorous policy. The Chinese people use millions of tons of materials produced with hard work to exchange for such a large pile of worthless paper money. And the imperialists rely on issuing paper money to exchange for the Chinese people's large amount of wealth, and use this wealth to plunder the Chinese people. How unfavorable this is to the Chinese people! Therefore, we should not only strictly oppose the circulation of foreign currencies in the Chinese market, but even the people's storage of foreign currencies should not be approved in principle (foreign currencies are different from gold and silver, they have no value in themselves, and the purchasing power they represent is also gradually decreasing). These foreign currencies should be gradually absorbed into the state bank as foreign exchange reserve funds, so as to exchange for various means of production necessary for our economic construction. Only in this way can we transform this destructive force that shakes prices and disrupts the market into a constructive force that is beneficial to the national economy.

    The result of years of rule by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism has hindered and destroyed the development of China's production. Therefore, most of China's private capital has deviated from production and turned to various speculative undertakings, especially gold, silver, and foreign currencies, which have become the most important speculative objects for speculators for several years. Now the situation has completely changed. In our liberated areas, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism have been eliminated, or are being eliminated. The political and economic forces of imperialism have also been greatly weakened. Therefore, industrial and agricultural production has been liberated and will be greatly developed. Now industrial and agricultural production is feeling the lack of production funds. We must mobilize this large amount of floating capital that has deviated from production and quickly return it to production; we must never allow them to engage in speculation and profiteering again, and engage in improper activities that hinder production development. In order to further get rid of the shackles of imperialism on us, we must also quickly manage foreign currencies in the Chinese market and persuade the people who hold foreign currencies to store their foreign currencies in the state bank. The state bank should also guarantee their legitimate interests, and never adopt the Kuomintang's deceptive methods, under the pretext of "currency reform," to carry out cruel plunder of the people who hold gold, silver, and foreign currencies.

    We are still in a war environment. Although the North China region has been completely liberated, the destruction of the war remains to be restored, the consumption of the war remains to be compensated, the state-owned economy is not yet strong enough to completely control the market, and most of the speculative capital nurtured by the Kuomintang's years of reactionary rule has not yet turned to production, and is still making waves and disrupting the market; coupled with the spring drought, it has aggravated the seasonal rise in grain prices. Due to the above reasons, it is still difficult for our prices to remain completely stable. However, compared with the price increase of two to three hundred times in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past month, our wartime prices can be said to be relatively stable. This is the result of our correct financial and economic policies. But we will never be satisfied with past achievements. We should further stabilize our prices. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to striving to develop production, restore transportation, adjust the supply and demand of materials, and regulate currency circulation, we must also strictly manage gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and fight against the corrupt speculative capital nurtured by the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. We must persuade all speculative capital to turn to production, and we have also held real-value savings to protect the meager savings of wage earners. In order to guarantee production development and protect the interests of the people, we must adhere to these correct policies and strive for their thorough implementation.

　　论金银外币管理
    薛暮桥
    要建立健全的和独立自主的经济体系，就必须建立健全的和独立自主的货币体系。
    国民党反动政府所发行的“法币”，从一开始就是被美英帝国主义所控制着。因而中国的金融、财政、以至其它经济事业，也不得不直接间接地受美英帝国主义的支配。在最近几年，国民党反动政府用惊人的速度滥发纸币，来对广大人民实行疯狂的掠夺。因此币值狂跌，物价飞涨。国民党反动政府为挽救其万分严重的经济危机，从“法币”变为“关金券”，变为“金元券”，最近又说要将“金元券”变为什么“银元券”。但其信用愈变愈低，现在已经完全破产。在国民党统治区市场上，“金元券”已到处被人民所拒绝，甚至连政府机关如邮政局、电报局等也纷纷拒绝“金元券”。代替“金元券”在市场流通的是金条，银元，以及美钞，港币等类外国货币。国民党的货币体系已经完全崩溃，它的经济体系也已经完全崩溃，当然更谈不到什么“独立自主”了。
    人民解放军和人民政府在其所到达的地区，首先遇到的一个迫切问题，就是怎样收拾这国民党反动政府遗留下来的完全混乱，和完全腐朽的货币市场。我们必须迅速发行保护经济发展和保护人民利益的人民票，来代替这已被人民所抛弃的“金元券”。对于这点，目前已无多大困难。因为“金元券”已经被人民所抛弃，所以任何地区一经解放，“金元券”就立刻变为废纸。它已再没有丝毫力量来阻碍人民票的发行和广泛流通。但代替“金元券”流通于市场的金条，银元，以及各种外国货币，如果我们不加管理，任其泛滥，则往往会成为我们建立健全的和独立自主的货币体系的一个严重的障碍。因为金银外币盘踞市场，不但会妨碍人民票的发行和广泛流通；而且由于金银和外币的投机，很容易引起物价的剧烈波动。如因此而使我们的市场陷于混乱的状态，那么经济的恢复和发展，就会遭遇困难。其理由是不待解释的。
    金银本来不是人民生活中的重要物资，但因千百年来把它作为交换媒介，因此在人们的思想中产生了一种神秘观念，它象偶像一样被人们所崇拜着。所以在国民党反动政府用猛烈的通货膨胀来对人民进行疯狂掠夺的时候，人民为着避免通货膨胀的损失而贮存金银，这是很自然的现象。尤其是曾在长时期中作为中国本位货币的银元，更容易在市场流通。但在我们已经驱逐了“金元券”，发行了人民票，保证了币值和物价相当稳定的时候，金银的再在市场流通，便不但毫无必要，而且已成为动摇物价，扰乱市场，破坏我们的货币制度的一个重要因素。一般投机商人不从事于正当的生产事业，专从事于金银的投机买卖。因为金银本身没有多少使用价值，其供求数量亦有相当的限制。因此金银的投机买卖，必然会引起金银价格的剧烈波动，并因此而影响到一般物价的平稳，国民党统治区市场每次物价波动，常由金银带头上涨，即可证明。因此人民政府虽不反对人民贮存金银，但对金银的计划行使，或投机买卖，则不能不严厉禁止。我们决不能服从少数投机商人的利益，而妨碍市场和人民生活的安定。
    美钞港币等类外国货币广泛流通于中国市场，有些地区且已超过“金元券”而与银元同样成为主要的通货，这更是殖民地国家所特有的现象。也是国民党反动政府多年来的卖国政策所产生的恶果。中国人民用辛辛苦苦生产出来的千百万吨物资，去换来这样一大堆不值钱的纸币。而帝国主义者则靠发行纸币，来换取中国人民的大量的财富，更利用这些财富来掠夺中国人民，这对中国人民是件何等不利的事情！因此我们不但应当严厉反对外国货币在中国市场上流通，就连人民贮存外国货币，原则上亦不应赞同（外国货币与金银不同，它的本身没有价值，它所代表的购买力亦在逐渐减少）。应当把这些外国货币逐渐吸收到国家银行里来，作为外汇准备基金，以便换回各种我们经济建设所必需的生产资料。这样才能把这动摇物价、扰乱市场的破坏力量，转化而为有利于国民经济的建设力量。
    帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义多年统治的结果，阻碍并破坏了中国生产事业的发展。因此中国大部份的私人资本便脱离生产，转向各种投机事业，尤其是金银和外国货币，若干年来成为投机商人最重要的投机对象。现在情况已经完全改变，在我解放区内，封建主义及官僚资本主义已被消灭，或者正被消灭。帝国主义的政治经济势力亦已大大削弱。因此工业农业生产已经获得解放，即将大大发展。现在工业农业生产正痛感到生产资金的缺乏，我们必须动员这脱离生产的大量游资，迅速回到生产事业中来；决不应当再让他们从事投机倒把，作妨碍生产发展的不正当的活动。为着进一步摆脱帝国主义对我们的束缚，更必须迅速管理中国市场上的外国货币，劝诱持有外币的人民，将他们的外币贮存在国家银行。国家银行亦应保障他们的正当利益，决不采取国民党的欺骗办法，借口什么“货币改革”而对持有金银外币的人民实行残酷的掠夺。
    现在我们仍然处于战争环境，华北地区虽已完全解放，但是战争的破坏尚待恢复，战争的消耗尚待弥补，国营经济还没有强大到足以完全控制市场，国民党多年的反动统治所孕育的投机资本大部尚未转向生产事业，仍在兴风作浪，扰乱市场；加以春旱成灾，更加重了季节性的粮价上涨。由于以上原因，使我们的物价尚难保持完全平稳。但与国民党统治区上月一个月中物价上涨二三百倍比较起来，我们的战时物价可以说是比较平稳的，这是我们正确的财政经济政策所产生的结果。但我们决不满足于以往的成就，我们还应进一步来使我们的物价更趋平稳。为要达此目的，我们除努力发展生产，恢复交通，调剂物资供求，调节货币流通外，同时必须严格管理金银外币，与国民党反动统治所孕育的腐朽的投机资本作斗争。我们必须劝导一切投机资本转向生产事业，我们且已举办折实储蓄，来保障薪资劳动者的升斗的蓄积。为着保证生产发展，为着保护人民利益，我们必须坚持这些正确政策，求其彻底实现。
