Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th: The Hankou Yangtze River Daily, the organ of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Wuhan Military Control Commission, published an inaugural editorial entitled "Celebrating the Birth of New Wuhan" on its founding on the 23rd, elaborating on the new tasks of the people in the three towns of Wuhan after liberation. The article first pointed out: Wuhan is the birthplace of the great "February 7th" strike and one of the centers of the Chinese workers' movement. Wuhan was also the evil fortress where warlords and reactionary figures such as Wu Peifu, Xiao Yaonan, Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi colluded with foreign imperialists to oppress and massacre the people. From May 16, 1949, the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism in Wuhan came to an end forever. The aspirations of Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, and many other martyrs have now been fully realized, and the three towns of Wuhan will forever belong to the people. The article then stated: The rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Wuhan has been overthrown, and the enemies with guns are gone, but the enemies without guns still exist. They will wear various masks and use various means to obstruct us and sabotage us. This is a long-term struggle. Therefore, we must be vigilant at all times, not be complacent, and not be confused. We must pay attention to, stop, and eliminate any sabotage plots by these lurking enemies, and systematically carry out our various revolutionary tasks in all aspects.

The article stated: Wuhan is the economic and cultural center of Central China and an important strategic base for liberating the area south of the Yangtze River. However, because the White bandit Bai Chongxi has devastated the prosperous Wuhan, we are facing great difficulties in all aspects. But these difficulties are temporary and can be completely overcome. The people of the three towns of Wuhan should unite under the leadership of the Communist Party, first and foremost the working class should unite with other working people, unite with intellectuals, and unite with private industrialists and businessmen. From now on, we should quickly restore all production and other economic undertakings that can be restored and must be restored, whether public or private. The article emphasized: We must not only restore and develop the state-owned economy, but also resolutely protect and develop legitimate private industry and commerce. As long as they abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government and operate factories and do business in accordance with the People's Government's policy of "both labor and capital benefiting, developing production," and are beneficial to the national livelihood, we will all welcome them and resolutely protect them. The article stated: The intellectuals and young students of the three towns of Wuhan have a glorious history of struggle and have played a significant role in the anti-Chiang and anti-American imperialist movements. Now that the period of building a new Wuhan has begun, they should further strengthen their revolutionary theoretical cultivation and strengthen their study of policies, science, culture, and professional skills in order to better serve the people. The article concluded: We firmly believe that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and relying on the joint efforts of our city's 1.2 million people and the people of Central China, the liberated three towns of Wuhan will certainly be rebuilt into a great economic and cultural center of China in the near future.

　　长江日报发刊词
  　号召建设新武汉
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】中共中央华中局及武汉军管会机关报汉口长江日报于二十三日创刊时发表题为“庆祝新武汉诞生”的发刊辞，阐述解放后武汉三镇人民的新任务。该文首先指出：武汉是伟大的“二七”大罢工的发祥地，是中国工人运动的中心之一。武汉又曾是吴佩孚、萧耀南、蒋介石、李宗仁、白崇禧这些反动派和官僚资本家勾结外国帝国主义压迫人民、屠杀人民的罪恶堡垒。从一九四九年五月十六日这一天起，国民党反动派和美帝国主义在武汉的统治永远地结束了。林祥谦、施洋和许多烈士的遗志，如今已完全实现，武汉三镇从此已永远属于人民。该文继称：国民党反动派在武汉的统治是打倒了，拿枪的敌人是没有了，不拿枪的敌人则仍然存在，他们将会戴着各色假面具，运用各种手段，阻挠我们，破坏我们，这是一个长期的斗争。因此，我们必须随时警惕，不要自满，不要糊涂，要注意、制止和消灭这些潜伏的敌人的任何破坏阴谋，并从各方面有步骤地展开我们的各种革命工作。
    该文称：武汉是华中的经济和文化中心，又是解放长江以南的一个重要的战略基地。但由于白匪崇禧把繁荣的武汉已破坏得残破不堪，因此就使得我们在各方面都感到很大困难。但这些困难是暂时的，是完全可以克服的。我们武汉三镇的人民，应在共产党的领导之下团结起来，首先是工人阶级同其他劳动人民团结起来，联合知识分子，联合私人工商业家，从现在起就把一切可以恢复与必须恢复的生产事业和其他经济事业，不论公私，迅速恢复起来。该文着重说明：我们不但要恢复与发展国营经济，而且要坚决保护与发展正当的私人工商业，只要他们遵守人民政府法令，按照人民政府的“劳资两利、发展生产”的方针办工厂、做生意，有益国民生计，我们就一律表示欢迎，坚决加以保护。该文称：武汉三镇的知识分子和青年学生，有过光荣的斗争历史，在反蒋反美帝的运动中起过重大的作用。现在建设新武汉的时期开始了，今后应该进一步加强自己的革命理论修养，和加强政策、科学文化与业务的学习，以便很好地为人民服务。该文结语称：我们完全相信，解放了的武汉三镇在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，依靠我们全市一百二十万人民和华中人民的共同努力，在不久的将来一定能够把它重建成中国一个伟大的经济文化中心。
