　　Prevention Methods for Gastrointestinal Infectious Diseases
    Li Kewen

    The most important gastrointestinal infectious diseases are typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera. Typhoid fever and dysentery occur sporadically in our country, especially in summer and autumn, and sometimes there is a large-scale epidemic. Cholera, on the other hand, has had a large-scale epidemic in different places every three to four years in the last ten years. The number of people who die from these infectious diseases in our country every year is no less than the number of deaths in a war. The financial resources consumed by illness and death each year are also no less than those consumed by a war. It's just that there are no clear statistics to give us a concrete and profound understanding. Gastrointestinal infectious diseases can be prevented with certainty.

    The reason why gastrointestinal infectious diseases cause epidemics is nothing more than three basic conditions: one is the existence of pathogens, the second is the formation of transmission media, and the third is the lack of immunity among the people. If we can thoroughly do a good job in one of the three, we can prevent the occurrence of the disease. However, in health work, due to the current poverty of economic conditions and the people's lack of understanding of health undertakings, it is difficult to achieve perfection. Therefore, at present, in the steps to eliminate gastrointestinal infectious diseases, we must proceed from all three aspects at the same time, and try our best to eliminate the existence of pathogens, eliminate various media of transmission, and enhance the general immunity of the people. Now let's examine the main points of transmission separately in order to determine our prevention and control methods.

    First, let's talk about pathogens. Once typhoid, dysentery bacilli, and cholera vibrio enter the human body through the mouth, if the body does not have sufficient immunity to kill them, they will rapidly divide and multiply in the intestine, forming lesions in the intestinal wall and producing toxins, causing people to develop disease symptoms. During the course of the disease, the patient's excrement and vomit contain countless pathogens. Even after the illness is cured, a very small number of people still excrete bacteria from their feces, and we call them carriers. Patients and carriers are the source of the spread of gastrointestinal infectious disease bacteria. Therefore, strict isolation of patients and appropriate management of carriers are the key to controlling the spread of pathogens.

    Secondly, let's talk about the media of transmission. The first is transmission through the patient's belongings, especially cups, spoons, bowls, and chopsticks. If they are not treated and then used by others, there is a risk of infection. The second is the use of feces as a medium of transmission. The patient's feces contain a large number of pathogens. If they are disposed of without treatment, they may be spread through other media. The third is water-borne transmission. Some places wash toilets in the river, polluting the river water. We need to further understand that even if the storage place of feces is away from the water source, there is still a risk of polluting the water source if it is within 100 feet. Most of our current toilet pits are made of permeable materials. Little do we know that the pathogens in the feces can seep up to 100 feet away with the feces and urine. If there is a well or other water source within 100 feet of the toilet pit, it will inevitably be contaminated by pathogens. Eating this contaminated raw water will give you a chance to get sick. Cold drinks such as sour plum soup, jelly, ice cream, and ice lollies made with this contaminated raw water can also cause illness if you eat them greedily. The fourth is transmission by flies. Our toilets or patient rooms generally do not have fly-proof equipment. In addition, garbage is piled up everywhere, and melon peels and rotten fruits are thrown away at will, which provides flies with a great opportunity to multiply. Flies fly from the toilet to the kitchen, and from the kitchen to the toilet, spreading the bacteria in the feces everywhere. All food and fruits, once left improperly, will be crawled and contaminated by flies, and then enter our mouths and cause disease. The fifth is indirect transmission caused by carriers. For example, if carriers are engaged in occupations such as chefs, waiters, food manufacturers, milk manufacturers, and food retailers, their hands often carry bacteria that contaminate food. Eating this contaminated food distributed to everyone will often cause an epidemic of gastrointestinal infectious diseases.

    Again, let's talk about the immunity of the people. Some people have developed lifelong immunity to typhoid fever because they have had typhoid fever. Some people have been immunized against cholera and typhoid fever by being vaccinated. Occasionally, after a cholera epidemic, some people in the epidemic area are more or less infected with cholera bacteria and acquire some slight natural immunity. However, the latter two types of immunity are temporary, lasting only about a year. Therefore, in order to prevent the epidemic of the disease, it is necessary to use artificial methods every year to enable the majority of the people to acquire immunity. Only when more than 60% of the people have immunity can the epidemic of the disease be stopped.

    Based on the above review, we also have a basis for implementing the eradication of cholera, typhoid fever, and other gastrointestinal infectious disease epidemics.

    A. Implement individual management. As long as we find patients with this type of disease, we will manage them individually. If infectious disease patients are found in hospitals or private clinics, they should be reported to the local health authority as soon as possible within 24 hours. If infectious disease patients are found in streets and alleys, parents or street leaders should also report them to the local health authority as soon as possible. The competent health authority will send someone to the place where the disease occurred to examine it and, if necessary, carry out disinfection work. If the patient is treated in the hospital, not only will the patient be safer, but it will also be of great benefit to others. If the patient stays at home for treatment, the person sent will guide the patient's family to let the patient live in a separate room. Guide a special person to take care of the patient. Others should not enter the patient's bedroom. The patient's cups, spoons, bowls, and chopsticks should be boiled and disinfected with boiling water after use and placed separately. The patient's clothes and bed sheets should also be scalded with boiling water before being taken out of the sick room. More attention should be paid to the patient's bowel movements. They should be kept in a commode containing disinfectant and poured into the toilet pit after two hours. In addition, the sick room should have fly-proof equipment to prevent flies from flying in and out. Only in this way can we achieve the effect of strictly isolating patients and controlling the spread of pathogens.

    B. Improve environmental sanitation and eliminate media of transmission. As mentioned earlier, water is one of the factors in the spread of gastrointestinal infectious diseases. In places with tap water facilities, because there are only one or two water sources for water supply, it is naturally easy to manage, and the component of water as a medium of transmission is greatly reduced. However, at present, the water that the people of our country drink is still mainly well water and river water, and there are many water supply units, which makes management more difficult. Moreover, most of the wells are not built in accordance with regulations. Either the well wall leaks, leading to the infiltration of pathogens, or the well platform and well curb are not good, inducing the backflow of sewage. Once a disease epidemic occurs, there is a possibility of being used as a medium of transmission. Therefore, water source improvement is the fundamental solution. On the passive side, only drinking water disinfection can be implemented during the disease epidemic season.

    Fecal treatment. Since feces contain a lot of gastrointestinal germs, we cannot help but think of the situation of toilets. Generally, toilets are almost all brick-built pits, each of which can function as a permeable agent, which may pollute nearby water sources. Moreover, the toilet has no doors and windows, and is a semi-open type, allowing flies to enter and exit, lay eggs and breed, manufacture flies, and spread bacteria, which should be improved.

    Management issues of the catering industry. Precisely because the treatment of water supply and feces is not thorough, the most severely affected is the shops that provide public food. Issues such as fly-proof equipment and the banning of food made with raw water should be managed urgently.

    C. Management of carriers. Carriers look no different from ordinary people, and it is difficult for us to detect and distinguish them. Therefore, all chefs and workers in food stores, food manufacturers, food retailers, and milk deliverers must undergo regular stool and urine examinations. If the examination is positive, the government has the right to force them to change careers to avoid spreading germs and harming the population.

    D. To enhance the immunity of the people. The above points are difficult to achieve in fact due to various insufficient conditions at present. The remedy is to passively increase our immunity. In order to enhance the public's resistance to gastrointestinal infectious diseases, the government should promote comprehensive cholera and typhoid fever vaccination, and the people should cooperate and strive to accept vaccination in order to achieve a good effect of curbing the disease.

　　肠胃传染病的预防方法
    李克温
    肠胃传染病中最主要的是伤寒、赤立霍乱三种。伤寒、赤痢在我国经常的散在的发生着，尤以夏秋为甚，有时来一次大流行。霍乱则在近十年来，每隔三四年在不同的地方发生一次大流行。我国每年死于这些传染病的人，不亚于一次战争死亡的人数。每年因获病与死亡消耗的财力，也不亚于一次战争所消耗的。只不过是没有明确的统计数字，使吾人得到一个具体的深刻的认识罢了。肠胃传染病是有把握能够遏止的。
    肠胃传染病所以惹起流行，不外于三种基本条件：一为病原菌的存在，二为传染媒介的形成，三为人民免疫力的缺如。吾人苟能彻底将三者中的一种作到好处，当可防止病的发生。但是，在卫生工作上由于目前经济条件的贫乏，与人民对卫生事业认识的不够，势难达到尽善尽美的成就。故目前在扑灭肠胃传染病的步骤上，必须本着三方面同时进行，尽可能的相法扑灭病原菌的存在，消除传染的种种媒介，增进人民的一般免疫力。现在先来分别检讨一下传染的要点，以便确定我们防制的方法。
    首先谈一谈病原。伤寒、赤痢杆菌及霍乱弧菌一经由口进入人体，如果身体不具有充分的免疫力，将其杀灭，则它们便迅速在肠内分裂增殖，在肠壁形成病灶，产生毒素，使人发生病的征状。在病期中病人的排泄物及呕吐物中，含有无数量的病原菌。在病愈后仍有极少数的人经常由粪便排泄病菌，我们称他为带菌人。病人及带菌人是肠胃传染病菌散播的策源地。所以病人的严格隔离及带菌人的适宜管理，为控制病原菌传播的要则。
    其次说到传染的媒介。第一是由于病人所用什物的媒介传染，尤其是杯匙碗筷，如果不加处理随即取供他人使用，则有受染的危险。第二是以粪便做为传染的媒介。病人粪便中含有大量的病原菌，如果未加处理即行倾倒，则可能更借其他的媒介物而转行传播。第三是以水为媒介的传染。有些地方在河内冲洗马桶，将河水污染。我们需要更进一步明了的，是粪便的存储地虽然离开了水源，但是其间相距在一百尺以内时，仍有污染水源的危险。我们目前一般的厕坑，多半是能够渗透的质料、殊不知粪便中的病原菌，能够随着粪尿渗透至百尺远的地方，如果在厕坑百尺以内有水井或其他水源时，难免不被病菌污染。吃了这种污染的生水便有生病的机会。用这种污染的生水做成的酸梅汤、凉粉、冰棍、洋淇淋等冷饮食，贪口的吃了，同样有得病的可能。第四是以苍蝇为媒介的传染。我们的厕所或病人住室，大都没有防蝇的设备。兼之垃圾到处堆积，瓜皮烂果随地抛充，皆给于苍蝇大量增殖的机会。苍蝇由厕所飞到了厨房，由厨房飞到了厕所，来回把粪便中的病菌到处传播。所有的食物及瓜果，一经放留不当，便被苍蝇爬抓染污，辗转到了吾人的口里而得病。第五是以带菌人引起的间接传染。例如带菌人从事厨师、侍役、食品制造者、牛乳制造者及食物零售商等职业，常由于两手带有病菌污染了食物。这种污染的食物分送给大家吃，常会引起肠胃传染病的流行。
    再次谈到人民的免疫力。有的人因得过伤寒而对伤寒具有了终身免疫力。有的人因注射过预防针，而对霍乱伤寒获得了免疫力。间或在霍乱流行之后，疫区的部分人民多多少少受到了霍乱菌的感染，而获得了些微的自然免疫力。但是后二种免疫力为时暂短，不过一年的样子。所以为期防止病的流行，势必每年以人工的方法，使大多数的人民获得免疫力不可。在百分之六十以上的人民具有了免疫力，才能制止病的流行。
    经由以上检讨的结果，我们为实施扑灭霍乱，伤寒等肠胃传染病的流行，亦就有了依据。
    甲、为实施个别管理。只要发现了这类的病人，我们即加以个别管理的意思。在医院里或私人的诊疗所发见了传染病人，应当在廿四小时内尽速报告给当地的卫生主管机关。各街巷内发见了传染病人，做家长的或街长亦应迅速的报告给当地的卫生主管机关。主管卫生机关自会派人到发病的地点诊察一番，必要时做一做消毒的工作。病人如果住在医院里治疗，不但病人自己较为安全，即对旁人亦有莫大的利益。病人如果留在家里治疗、派去的人自会指导病人家庭让病人单独住一间屋子。指导一个专人扶侍病人。旁人不要进入病人的卧室。病人用的杯匙碗筷，用后以沸水煮沸消毒，单独放置。病人的衣服被单在拿出病室之前亦须用沸水烫过。病人的大小便更应当注意，把它保留在盛有消毒剂的便器内，经过二小时后才能倾倒在厕坑里。此外病室应有防蝇的设备，防止苍蝇飞进飞出。如此才能收到严格隔离病人的效果，才能达到控制病原菌的散播。
    乙、为改善环境卫生，消除传染的媒介。前已说过水是传播肠胃传染病的因子之一。在有自来水设备的地方，因给水的水源只有一二处，管理起来自然容易，以水为传染媒介的成分，亦因之大大减低。但是目前我国人民饮用的水，仍以井水河水为主，供水的单位很多，管理起来就比较困难。并且一般井的建筑，十有八九多不合规定，不是井壁漏水，引致病菌的渗入，就是井台井栏不好，诱使污水倒流，一有疾病流行，就有做为传染媒介的可能。所以水源改良是根本的办法。消极方面亦只有在疾病流行的季节，实施饮水消毒了。
    粪便的处理。粪便既然含有很多的肠胃病菌，我们不能不联想到厕所的情形。一般的厕所几乎全是砖砌的坑，个个能营渗透的作用，很可能污染到附近的水源。并且厕所没有门窗，为一种半露天式的，任凭苍蝇进出，产卵滋生，制造苍蝇，散播病菌，实在应当加以改良了。
    制售饮食业的管理问题。正因为给水与粪便的处理不彻底，连带受影响最重的是供给大众饮食的店铺。诸如防蝇的设备，生水做的饮食的取缔等，急应加以管理。
    丙、为带菌人的管理。带菌人外表看来与常人无异，很难让我们觉察分别。所以一切饮食店的厨师工役、食品制造者、食品零售商、牛乳制送者，皆须定期举行大小便的检查。如果检查为阳性者，政府有权迫令其改业，以免散播病菌，加害人群。
    丁、为增进人民的免疫力。上述的几点在目前事实上由于种种条件不够，难能做到好处。补救的办法，只有消极的来增加吾人的免疫力了。欲期增进大众对肠胃传染病的抗力，在政府方面应推行全面的霍乱伤寒疫苗预防注射，在人民方面应协力争先接受注射，才能达到遏止疾病的良好效果。
