　　During the May Fourth Movement, intellectuals and young students played a leading role. They can be said to be the most conscious vanguards of the movement. Their heroic struggle brought the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution to a new stage. This is undoubtedly a glorious page. However, the May Fourth Movement did not complete the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution because the fundamental force of the revolution—the working class and peasantry—was not yet strong enough, and the integration of intellectuals with the workers and peasants was not close and solid enough.

　　"If intellectuals do not integrate with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The failures of the Revolution of 1911 and the May Fourth Movement are the reasons for this. The final division between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and practice integrating with the workers and peasants. Their final division lies solely in this point." This passage from Chairman Mao's discussion of the May Fourth Movement applies to all young students and intellectuals throughout the country. However, I believe it is even more meaningful for the students and friends in the liberated areas and should be taken as our own motto and guide for study and work.

　　The reason I want to particularly emphasize the liberated areas is simply because in the KMT-controlled areas, the heavy oppression and dark environment indeed make it difficult for general intellectuals and young students to approach the people. It is particularly difficult to delve into the workers and peasants, to closely connect and integrate with them, and to wholeheartedly serve them. This is precisely what the Kuomintang reactionaries are most concerned about, and they spare no effort to prevent and obstruct it by the most vicious means, imposing various restrictions and constraints, slaughtering and destroying. (Until the eve of their final demise, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was still frantically arresting and killing young people.) However, now we have been liberated. Not only have all shackles and threats been wiped out and no longer exist, but on the contrary, we can receive instructions, encouragement, and help from the Party, government, and military authorities at any time and anywhere. As long as intellectuals and young students are truly willing, truly determined to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the broad masses of people, to learn from them, and to serve them, then their aspirations will surely be realized, and their determination will not be in vain. The only fear is that we ourselves lack the determination and courage to immediately put down the old baggage, the inherited burdens, sweep away the stale dust, cleanse our minds, and start anew.

　　In all liberated areas, the call for a shortage of cadres can be heard everywhere. Many things are not being done because there is no one to do them and have to be temporarily put aside. This shortage of cadres is particularly serious in newly liberated areas. Even within the troops, this phenomenon exists. According to a comrade working in the Political Department of the Henan Military Region, after the victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning greatly increased. Many soldiers saved their meager money to buy pens, pencils, notebooks, and paper for writing. During the arduous marches, they took special care to protect these stationery items, wrapping them in clean, torn socks or oiled paper and carrying them in their backpacks. They would take them out and use them whenever they had the opportunity. Their sincere attitude towards learning is truly touching. However, there is an extreme shortage of cadres to guide their learning. Sometimes, in a large unit, there are only a few literary or educational officers, which is simply not enough to cope with the situation. Intellectuals and young students with even a little ability are regarded as treasures, and everyone is vying for them. Of course, there are also a few literary and art workers who go to the troops, but their purpose seems limited to collecting materials. They often only stay for a short period and then leave. Moreover, their lives and feelings are never truly integrated with the general soldiers, forming a harmonious whole. They even have conflicts with lower-level cadres. Therefore, from beginning to end, they are only guests and observers, feeling more and more lonely and isolated, or developing other morbid thoughts and feelings as the fighting becomes more intense and the work becomes more tense. This shows that there are still not many intellectuals and young students who have truly penetrated the workers and peasants after joining the liberation movement, and more efforts are needed from everyone.

　　Now the army has long crossed the Yangtze River, liberated Nanjing, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been basically defeated and is on the verge of extinction. Victory on a national scale is just around the corner; therefore, our responsibilities are particularly heavy. All intellectuals and young students, especially the students and friends in the liberated areas, should recognize the current situation, seize the favorable opportunity, and unhesitatingly go deep into the countryside, factories, and troops. Not only in words but also in actions, they should integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the broad masses of people, dedicating all our abilities and our lives to this unprecedentedly great democratic revolution. I believe that this is the only way to be worthy of the identity of revolutionary intellectuals and to withstand the test of the times without falling behind, becoming waste and dregs.

　　"If intellectuals do not integrate with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing." This is indeed the only truth. I hope that every intellectual, every young student, can firmly remember these words in their hearts.

    唯一的真理
    何家槐
    在“五四”时候，知识分子和青年学生起了带头的作用，可以说是最先觉悟的运动先锋，他们的英勇奋斗，使反帝反封建的中国资产阶级民主革命发展到了一个新的阶段，这无疑地是很光荣的一页。可是，“五四”运动并没有完成反帝反封建的民主革命，因为当时革命的根本力量——工农阶级还没有强大，而知识分子与工农群众的结合，也还不够密切和巩固。
    “知识分子如果不与工农民众相结合，则将一事无成，辛亥革命与‘五四’运动的失败，就是这个原因。革命的，或不革命的，或反革命的知识分子之最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行结合工农民众，他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点”，这一段毛主席论“五四运动”中所说的话，固然适用于全国青年学生和知识分子，可是，我认为对于解放区的同学们和朋友们，却更有意义，更应该引为我们自己的座右铭和学习工作的指南。
    我所以要特别强调解放区的缘故，无非是因为在蒋管区，压迫之沉重，环境之黑暗，的确使一般知识分子和青年学生不容易接近人民，要深入工农群众，与之密切联系和结合，全心全意地为他们服务，尤为困难。国民党反动派所最顾忌的，也就是这点，不惜用最毒辣的手段来防止，来阻挠，加以各种限制和束缚，屠戮和摧残。（直到最后覆灭的前夕，蒋匪帮还在疯狂地逮捕和杀害青年）可是，现在我们已经解放了，不但一切桎梏和威胁，都已一笔勾消，不复存在，而且相反地，随时随地都能得到党政军当局的指示，鼓励，和帮助。知识分子和青年学生只要真正愿意，真正有决心和工农兵结合，和广大的人民结合，向他们学习，为他们服务，那末他的志愿一定可以实现，他的决心一定不会落空；怕只怕我们自己没有决心和勇气，不能立刻放下旧包袱，放下因袭的重担，拂去陈腐的灰尘，洗心革面，重新做人。
    在各解放区，到处都可听到缺少干部的呼声，很多事情都没有人做，只好暂时搁置。在新解放区，这种干部荒的情形尤其严重。即在部队里面，也有这种现象。据一位在河南军区政治部工作的同志说，战士们，在淮海战役胜利结束以后，学习热情大大的提高，很多士兵都节省仅有的钱购置钢笔、铅笔、笔记簿和纸张，学习写作。在艰苦的行军中，他们把这些文具保护得特别小心，用洗干净的破袜子或油布油纸等包裹起来，放在背囊里随身携带，一有机会，就拿出来应用；其真诚的学习态度，的确是很令人感动的。可是，指导他们学习的干部却异常缺少，有时偌大的一个部队，只有寥寥几个文艺干事或教育干事，实在应付不过来。对于稍有能力的知识分子和青年学生，简直看成了宝贝，大家抢着要。当然也有少数文艺工作者进部队去，但他们的目的似乎只限于搜集材料，往往只住一个短时期就走，而且生活和感情，始终不能和一般战士们水乳交融，打成一片，甚至和下级干部也有合不来的地方，因此，自始至终都只是一个客人和旁观者的身份，弄得战斗越激烈，工作越紧张，而越感孤单，越感寂寞，或发生其他病态的思想和感情。由此可见，知识分子和青年学生投身于解放运动，真正能够深入工农后的人还不多，还有待于大家的努力。
    现在大军早已过江，解放了南京，国民党的反动统治基本上已经打垮，归于消灭，全国范围以内的胜利，指日可待；因此我们的责任也特别重大了。所有的知识分子和青年学生，特别是在解放区的同学们和朋友们，都应该认清目前的形势，把握有利的时机，毫不踌躇地深入农村、工厂、和部队，不但在口头上，而且在行动上与工农兵结合起来，与广大群众结合起来，把我们所有的本领和我们的生命一道，贡献给这一空前伟大的民主革命，我认为这样才无愧于革命知识分子的身份，也才经得起时代的考验而不致落伍，变成废料和残渣。
    “知识分子如果不与工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”这实在是一个唯一的真理。希望每一个知识分子，每一个青年学生，都能够把这话牢牢的记在心头。
