[Beijing News] The full text of Ma Yinchu's speech at the Beijing People's Welcome Rally:

　　Respected leaders, fellow compatriots. Last time when our delegation went abroad, we were warmly seen off by you all. This time, our mission is complete and we have returned home, and we are once again warmly welcomed by you here. This makes us extremely excited and very grateful. Regarding the work done by the delegation abroad and all the details of what transpired, we plan to publish a booklet in the near future to report to the compatriots across the country. Here, brothers would like to briefly talk about the success and gains of the conference.

　　A total of 72 countries participated in the conference, with 2,005 delegates. The number of people supporting the World Peace Congress was no less than 800 million. The scale and strength were unprecedented. No wonder American and British imperialism is trembling there. They used all sorts of despicable and filthy means to sabotage the ongoing Peace Congress, but in the end, not only did they completely fail, but they also increased the strength of the Peace Congress. For example, for the representatives of the Soviet Union and Eastern European democratic countries, they only allowed eight people to enter Paris. As for China, they not only imposed an eight-person limit but also required China to negotiate with the French consul in Beijing. The Chinese delegation firmly opposed this. Therefore, we held a meeting in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, with the representatives from Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union who were not going to France. Although there were two venues, Paris and Prague, there was only one conference. Although the number of people at the Prague conference was small (272), the spirit was the same as the Paris conference. Originally, representatives who could not attend the Paris conference due to circumstances reported to Prague to protest the unreasonable restrictions of the French government, thus further increasing the momentum and strengthening the force.

　　Compatriots, this time, I and my colleagues, a total of 39 people, represented China's 475 million compatriots to attend the World Peace Congress. The number of delegates from our country going abroad this time is the largest in recent years, but it is still small compared to other countries. Although the number of Chinese representatives is small, the gains are indeed not small; the contribution to world peace is also not insignificant. This is not an exaggeration, but a true reflection of the actual situation. If you don't believe me, please allow me to explain:

　　Just as we were giving a speech at the conference, the chairman of the conference suddenly announced to the conference the news that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yangtze River and liberated Nanjing. The whole audience burst into thunderous applause, cheering "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Mao Zedong!" as if China's victory was the victory of all the countries participating in the Peace Congress. Chairman Mao is indeed the savior of China, and also their savior. From then on, world peace is guaranteed, because after the liberation of all of China, the reactionary groups used by American imperialism can no longer realize the ambition of the United States to dominate the world. From then on, the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a third world war can also be completely shattered, and world peace can therefore be guaranteed. And the representatives of various countries recognize Chairman Mao as one of the great leaders in defending world peace, for this reason.

　　Compatriots, American imperialism, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, originally wanted to attack the Soviet Union, and wanted to use China's manpower and material resources to reduce the sacrifices of the United States itself. This purpose is exactly the same as the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization concluded by the United States and Western European countries. The purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is nothing more than to use the working masses of Western European countries to fight to the death for the United States. We must rely on the propaganda machinery of the World Peace Congress to explain this conspiracy of American imperialism to those who are not clear-headed, awaken them from their dreams, and make them also join the camp of the peace movement, so that the number of people supporting the peace movement will increase from 800 million to 1 billion, 1.2 billion, 1.4 billion, and so on. In this way, a third world war can be avoided, and world peace can be maintained for a long time. Not only will the working masses of our country not be sacrificed for the United States without compensation, but other countries will also not suffer unprecedented disasters. Therefore, the victory of the People's Liberation Army and the leadership of Chairman Mao not only saved China but also saved the whole world. Therefore, our progress today under the banner of Chairman Mao is for self-salvation and for saving others, for eliminating the crisis of war and striving for lasting peace.

　　Compatriots, our victory has given great encouragement to the weak and small nations who are currently fighting against imperialism, such as Greece, Burma, Vietnam, Indonesia, and so on. They believe that China's victory is enough to prove that imperialism is not to be feared. The United States supplied Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group with so many guns, tanks, airplanes, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns. As a result, in less than two and a half years, these weapons fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and Chiang Kai-shek's five or six million troops were utterly defeated. The conspiracy of the United States in China was shattered. The United States also got the title of "paper tiger." This fact increases the courage of the weak and small nations, and it is expected that their liberation is just around the corner. Therefore, a representative from Africa said that Chairman Mao is also the savior of Africa.

　　Compatriots, I have already said that we are fighting against evil forces in order to strive for peace, because unless we eliminate American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, the running dogs of American imperialism, we cannot achieve domestic peace; without domestic peace, we cannot build, and without construction, we cannot produce a new China, and the general public will still have to live a very difficult life. If we want to increase production, prosper the economy, raise the living standards of the working masses, and enhance the lifelong happiness of men, women, old and young, we must quickly engage in construction. Did not the socialist Soviet Union rely on several five-year plans to achieve its goals? If our country wants to rise from the status of an agricultural country to an industrial country, there is no other way but to follow the example of the Soviet Union. The construction of the Soviet Union is very rapid and its strength is very strong. If we want to build a new China, we must learn from it. In addition, the Soviet Union is a bastion of world peace, and it is especially important to be friendly with it. Marshal Stalin deserves to be the leader of the group defending world peace. However, as long as the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group exists, the construction of the new China cannot proceed for a single day. I still hope that compatriots—especially those on the front lines—will work harder, move forward steadily, and never stop until the great cause of liberation is completely accomplished.

　　Finally, let us jointly shout a few slogans:

　　Long live the Chinese people!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live the heroic People's Liberation Army!
　　Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!
　　Long live the World Peace Congress, long live!

　　马寅初先生讲演词
    【本市讯】马寅初在北平人民欢迎大会上的讲演全文：
    诸位首长，诸位同胞。上次我们代表团出国的时候，承诸位先生热烈地欢送，此次我们的任务完成归国，又蒙诸位在此地热烈地欢迎，实在使我们异常兴奋，非常感谢。代表团在国外所做的工作与一切经过的情形，在最近的将来，拟印行一种小册子向全国同胞报告。此地兄弟欲把大会的成功与收获稍稍说一说。
    参加大会的国家共有七十二国，代表人数有二千零五人，拥护世界和平大会的人数不下八万万，声势之浩大，力量之雄厚为从来所未有，莫怪美英帝国主义在那里发抖。他们用种种卑劣龌龊的手段来破坏正在召开的和平大会，结果，不但完全失败，反而增加了和平大会的力量。譬如对于苏联及东欧各民主国家的代表，他们只准八人进巴黎，对于中国，不但加以八人的限制，还要中国与驻北平的法国领事交涉，中国代表团坚决反对。因此我们与东欧各国及苏联不到法国去的代表在捷克首都布拉格开会，会场虽有巴黎与布拉格两个，而会议只有一个。布拉格大会的人虽少（二百七十二人）而精神则与巴黎大会一样，原来因事不能参加巴黎大会的代表，因抗议法政府之无理限制，都到布拉格报到，于是声势益加浩大，力量益加雄厚。
    同胞们，此次兄弟与同人等共三十九人代表中国四万万七千五百万同胞，出席保卫世界和平大会，历年来我国代表团出国，以此次之人数为最多，但与他国相较则少，中国代表之人数虽少，而所得收获，实在不少；对于世界和平之贡献亦不可谓不多。此非鄙人夸大之词，实乃实际情形之写真，谓余不信请申其说：
    当我们适在大会演说之时，忽由大会主席向大会报告中国解放军渡江，解放南京的消息，全场掌声震天，欢呼中国解放军万岁，毛泽东万岁，一若中国之胜利就是参加和平大会各国的胜利，毛主席固是中国的救星，亦是他们的救星。从此世界和平得有保障，因为全中国解放之后，美国帝国主义所利用的反动集团，不能再实现美帝统治全世界的野心，从此美帝要发动第三次大战的阴谋亦可以完全粉碎，世界和平因此可得了保障。而各国代表承认毛主席为保卫世界和平之伟大的领袖之一，理由在此。
    同胞们，美帝勾结蒋介石反动集团原欲来攻苏联，欲利用中国的人力物力来减少美帝自己的牺牲。这个目的，和美帝与西欧各国缔结北大西洋公约的目的完全相同，北大西洋公约的目的，无非欲利用西欧各国的劳动群众为美帝拼死命。我们就要靠世界和平大会的宣传机构，把美帝这种阴谋向头脑不清楚的人说说明白，唤醒他们的沉梦，使他们也来加入和平运动的阵营，使拥护和平运动的人自八万万、增至十万万十二万万、十四万万不等。这样一来，第三次大战可免，而世界和平可以维持于久远。非特我国劳动群众不致无代价地为美帝牺牲，即其他国家亦不致受到空前之灾害。故解放军之胜利与毛主席之领导，不但救了中国，亦且救了全世界。所以我们今日在毛主席旗帜之下节节前进，是为自救救人，是为消灭战争危机、争取永久和平。
    同胞们，我们的胜利，予今日正在与帝国主义战斗的弱小民族如希腊、缅甸、越南、印尼等等以极大的鼓励。他们以为中国的胜利，足以证明帝国主义之不足惧。美帝以这许多枪炮、坦克、飞机、高射炮、机关枪，供给蒋介石反动集团，结果，不到二年半的功夫，这许多武器，都落在解放军手中，而蒋介石的五六百万军队，都打得落花流水。美帝在中国的阴谋，为之粉碎。美帝且得了“纸老虎”之称。这种事实，增加弱小民族的勇气，预料他们的解放，指日可待也。所以非洲有一位代表说毛主席亦是非洲的救星。
    同胞们，我已经说过，我们为争取和平与恶势力奋斗，因为不把美帝和美帝的走狗蒋介石反动集团消灭，我们不能得到国内和平；国内没有和平，我们不能建设，不能建设，就不能产生一个新中国，一般老百姓依然要过很艰难的生活。我们要是生产增加，经济繁荣，提高劳苦大众的生活水准，增进男女老幼的终身幸福，非快快从事建设不可。实行社会主义的苏联，非仰仗于几个五年计划而达其目的乎。倘我国欲从农业国的地位一升而为工业国，除效法苏联外，别无他法。苏联的建设，非常迅速，实力非常雄厚，我们要建设新中国，非向他学习不可。加以苏联是世界和平的堡垒，尤非与他亲善不可。斯大林大元帅不愧为保卫世界和平集团的领袖。不过蒋介石反动集团一天存在，新中国的建设一天不能进行。还希望同胞们--尤其在前方的同胞们--努力加鞭，节节前进，非把解放的大事业全部完成，决不终止。
    最后让我们共同欢呼几句口号：
    中国人民万岁
    中国共产党万岁
    英勇的解放军万岁
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁
    保卫世界和平大会万岁，万岁。
