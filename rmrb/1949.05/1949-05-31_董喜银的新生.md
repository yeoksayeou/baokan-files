　　Dong Xiyin's New Life
　　Zhang Mingquan
　　In Wangmaoliu Village, Qingfeng Third District, there's a man named Dong Xiyin, forty-six years old this year, a man who lives only for himself. Ask about what time he gets up? The children in the village will laugh. Ask about what time he goes to sleep? The children will laugh again.

　　His daughter's husband's family lives in Liugu, five li away from Wangmaoliu Village. One spring morning two years ago, his daughter had breakfast, washed the pot, and came to see him. When she arrived, the courtyard was quiet, and the door was still closed. His daughter called out several times before Xiyin slowly got up.

　　Last year, during the autumn seedling weeding season, one afternoon, just as the villagers had gone to the fields, a neighbor's child came to deliver water from the field. Because he didn't see Xiyin in the fields, he went to his door and called him to go to work. The door was closed; he was already asleep. When asked why he was sleeping so early, he said it was to save from having to cook another meal.

　　In his fields, the weeds were taller than the seedlings, and the grain harvested from his nine mu of land wasn't enough to eat.

　　Speaking of this man, he wasn't lazy before. After his father split from the family in the courtyard, none of the other households had as many farm tools as his. At that time, everyone said that he and his father were ambitious in making a fortune. Before the years of famine, his parents were both alive, and Xiyin and his wife had two sons and two daughters, all thriving. His eldest daughter was married in Liugu, and his eldest son was twelve years old, studying at school, known for his cleverness. Who knew that in 1943, due to a poor harvest, coupled with the Japanese occupation and a widespread epidemic, all three children died one after another. The following year was a great famine. Landlords hoarded grain, and twenty jin of millet couldn't buy one mu of land. The Japanese devils and traitors took what they wanted. By the time the wheat was ripe, what did Xiyin's family have left to eat? By June, the sun had scorched all the grass in the fields. Xiyin's mother fell ill, "and was buried in the clothes she was wearing," he would weep when he thought of it! At the end of July, Xiyin buried his wife. Nearing the Mid-Autumn Festival, Xiyin's father also fell ill, and before the Mid-Autumn Festival, his father also left him. Xiyin banged his head in the courtyard and cried, and the neighbors wept with him…

　　From then on, Dong Xiyin, who used to be talkative and cheerful, walked with his head down, never greeting anyone he met. He only thought about one thing all day long: "What's the point of living?"

　　After the land reform, last spring, the Communist Party led everyone in engaging in production, and the village's production became increasingly enthusiastic, but Xiyin couldn't get motivated.

　　Communist Party member Dong Jinbao, upon hearing the higher-ups' call to reform the lazy, immediately thought of his own relative, Dong Xiyin. From then on, Jinbao constantly tried to persuade Xiyin.

　　At first, Dong Xiyin ignored him. Later, Dong Xiyin verbally agreed, but when he was dragged to the fields and picked up a tool, he would sigh and sit down again.………

　　Last summer, one day during the midday break, Jinbao again persuaded Xiyin. After much persuasion, Xiyin, while stirring the pot and sighing, said:

　　"You say I'm not motivated to work. When I come back from the fields, I have to cook for myself. By the time others have finished their midday break and gone back to the fields, I haven't even had a bite to eat. How can I be motivated?" Jinbao said:

　　"Brother, what will you eat if you don't work? You can't even take care of your own mouth. No woman will want to marry you. Cheer up and change your reputation. As your brother, I will definitely help you."

　　From then on, Xiyin's labor gradually improved. Jinbao became busy, running around to play matchmaker. Last autumn, he went to Xiyin's great-aunt's house in Zhaolu twice just for this matter.

　　By the end of the year, a maternal aunt from Xiyin's sister's family in Zhou Village finally arranged a match for Xiyin. The woman was from Nie Village, divorced from her husband due to abuse, but was good at managing a household and had a three-year-old daughter with her. When the matchmaker spoke, the woman said: I'm not looking for anything fancy, just honesty and harmony will do.

　　After the marriage was arranged, Jinbao was very happy. He busied himself with the wedding preparations, more than anyone else. On March 16th, he got up especially early. The aunties and sisters-in-law in the courtyard helped Xiyin tidy up the house and courtyard. Jinbao ran in and out. The children in the village teased Xiyin, making him a little embarrassed. The courtyard was filled with laughter, and Jinbao's voice seemed particularly loud.

　　As noon approached, Jinbao returned from outside the village. He hadn't even entered the door when he shouted loudly: She's coming soon, quickly prepare! A maternal aunt from the family took a dipper and went home to get sorghum. Another sister-in-law hurried to get incense. Jinbao said, "Look, you're still superstitious." The aunt smiled embarrassedly and said, "It's not superstition, it's just an old custom." After she finished speaking, she giggled and went to get the sorghum.

　　The matchmaker arrived with a woman dressed in new clothes. The aunties ignored Jinbao's advice, pulled Xiyin out, and pushed the two to kowtow. …

　　The moon had already risen above the willow branches east of the village. The sounds of laughter gradually quieted down. The newly married couple entered the room. Jinbao came out of Xiyin's house. He also yawned easily, smiled, looked at the waxing and waning moon, and went back to sleep. He thought on the way: I have to get up early tomorrow to weed the wheat.

　　The wheat seedlings, after being battered by the winter wind and snow, grew again in the spring breeze. After Dong Xiyin got married, his heart was like the wheat seedlings. He started to haul manure to the fields. After weeding the wheat, he planted cotton and also weighed some millet and sorghum. He was very motivated in production.

　　The first time I went to visit Dong Xiyin, I didn't see him. His wife told me: These days are the April market. After Xiyin finished planting the fields, he went to the market to sell mung bean noodles with his relatives. On May 7th, Xiyin returned. When I asked him about his business these days, he smiled and told me: Besides eating and drinking, they attended five markets and earned a total of eighty or ninety thousand yuan, which solved the family's food expenses.

　　董喜银的新生
    张明权
    清丰三区王耄刘庄，有个董喜银，今年四十六岁了，这是个一个人吃饱了一家不饿的人。问起他啥时候起床？庄上的小孩们就乱笑，问起他啥时候睡觉？小孩们又乱笑一阵。
    他闺女婆家在留固，离王耄刘庄五里路。前年春天，闺女吃过早饭，刷了锅来看他，到家，院子里静静悄悄的，屋门还关着哩，闺女喊了好几声，喜银才慢腾腾地爬起来。
    去年正锄秋苗，一天下午，庄上的人刚下地不大会，邻居有个小孩，到地里送水回来，因为在地里没看见喜银，路过他门口，进去喊他下地，屋门关上了，原来他已经睡啦，问他为啥睡这样早，他说省得再烧一顿汤。
    他的地里草比苗还高，九亩地打的粮食不够吃。
    说起这人，从前可不懒。他父亲和院里分家以后，几个院里都没有他家农具添得全，那时候谁不说他爷俩发家有志气。灾荒年前，父母双全，喜银两口子跟前两男两女，一个个象水葱。大闺女嫁在留固，大儿十二岁了，在学里念书，出名的伶俐。谁知道民国三十二年歉收，再加鬼子扫荡，闹起流行病来，三个小孩接着都死了。第二年大灾荒，地主家里屯粮食，二十斤谷子一亩地没人要，鬼子汉奸连要带抢，麦熟时，喜银家还有点啥吃。到六月，太阳把地里的草都晒死啦，喜银的娘病倒啦，“就穿着随身衣裳入的土呀”，他想起来就掉泪！七月底，喜银又埋了他老婆。快八月节，喜银的爹也躺倒啦，没有出八月，他爹又离开了他。喜银在院子里碰着头哭，邻居们陪着他流泪……
    从那以后，爱说爱笑的董喜银，走起路来低下头，不管见谁也不打招呼，他成天价只想一个事：“活着到底有啥味呢？”
    土地改革后，去年春天，共产党领导大家闹生产，庄上的生产越来越热，喜银的心里就提不起劲。
    共产党员董金保，听了上级号召改造懒汉，他登时就想起本家兄弟董喜银来，从那时，金保就不断劝喜银。
    才一劝，董喜银不理。后来，董喜银嘴里答应着，拉到地里，拿起家具来，长叹一口气又坐下了。………
    去年夏天，有一天歇晌的时候，金保又劝喜银，劝到后来，喜银烧着锅叹着气说：
    “你说我做活不起劲，上地回来，还得自己做饭，人家歇晌起来下地啦，我还没有吃到嘴里哩，我怎会起劲？”金保说：
    “兄弟：你不劳动吃啥？自己的嘴都顾不上，人家妇女谁跟咱过，提起精神来吧，改改自己的名誉，当哥的一定帮你的忙。”
    从那以后，喜银的劳动慢慢有了点起色，金保可忙起来了，东扑西扑的说媒，去年秋天，单为这事往喜银的老姥姥家赵鲁跑了两次。
    到了年底，周庄喜银姐姐家的婶子，终久给喜银说成了，那边娘家是聂庄的，因为受气和男人离了婚，过日子的好手，还带着一个三岁的小闺女。说媒的时候，那妇女说：咱不攀高，老老实实和和睦睦的就行。
    亲事说成以后，金保可高兴啦，他张罗着办喜事，比谁都忙。三月十六那天，他起得分外早，本院的婶子嫂子们帮着喜银收拾屋里院里，金保跑进来又跑出去，庄上的小孩们和喜银闹，闹得喜银有些不好意思，院子里充满了笑声，金保的声音，分外显得高些。
    天快晌午了，金保从庄外看了回来，没进门就高声喊道：快来啦，急忙准备呀！本家一个婶子，拿了升就回家装高粱，一个嫂子又忙着去拿香。金保说：“看，你们还迷信哩。”那婶子笑着不好意思的说：“啥迷信呀，也不过是老俗礼吧。”说完以后，笑得咯咯的又去拿高粱了。
    媒人陪着一个穿新衣裳的妇女来了，婶子们不听金保的意见，把喜银拉出来，推着两人磕了个头。……
    月亮已经升到庄东头柳树梢上，欢笑的声音渐渐静下来，一对新夫妇入了房，金保从喜银家出来，他也轻松的打了一个啊欠，微笑着看了看那缺了又圆起来的月亮，回去睡觉了。他在路上想着：明天得早起下地锄麦去。
    地里的麦苗，经过冬天风雪的蹂躏，在春风里又长起来了。董喜银结婚以后，他的心也象麦苗一样，他开始把粪拉到地里。锄过了麦子，就点种棉花，还称了一些谷子、高粱，生产很有劲。
    我第一次去访问董喜银，没有见到他，他老婆告诉我：这两天正是四月会，喜银种完了地，就在会上和亲戚合伙卖绿豆面条哩。五月七号，喜银回来了，当我问起他这几天的买卖时，他笑着告诉我：除了吃喝以外，连赶了五个会，他们一共赚了八九万块钱，这就解决了一家人的菜食问题。
