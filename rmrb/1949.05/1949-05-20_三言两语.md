　　Brief Comments
　　Check After Having a Plan
　　The Ping Municipality General Trade Union checked the four major tasks and found many problems. Some were done very well, and some had not even started. This shows that when implementing established policies and plans, it is necessary to conduct regular checks, commend the good, criticize the bad, and expose those who only make empty promises and do not engage in arduous work bit by bit in action.
　　Go All Out to Protect Seedlings
　　In areas where there is drought and no sowing has been done, a concentrated effort should be made to sow. In areas where seedlings have emerged, all efforts should be made to protect them. To protect seedlings, it is necessary to overcome the following enemies that threaten the survival of seedlings: First, continue to overcome the drought to ensure that the seedlings do not wither and die; second, prevent and extinguish insect pests; third, prevent wind... Last year's warm winter and the lack of widespread autumn plowing, coupled with this year's drought, all these situations are unfavorable to the seedlings. We must be extra careful to protect them and must not be careless.
　　Shift to Peaceful Industry
　　Timely shifting some unnecessary war industries to peaceful industries is a wise and far-sighted measure. This shift is a signal for the comprehensive start of comprehensive peaceful construction in the North China region. At the same time, this is also a new and complex task that will not be accomplished overnight. It includes changes in business management methods, production methods, technology, habits, etc. The experience of Beiping provides a good principle: it must face the countryside, serve the vast number of peasants, and manufacture agricultural tools and various agricultural machines, so as to open up the largest market.

　　三言两语
　　有了计划就要检查
    平市总工会检查四大任务，发现很多问题，有的作得很好，有的甚至还未动手，由此可见在贯彻既定的方针计划时必须经常地进行检查，表扬好的，批评坏的，揭发那些只会作空口诺言，而不在行动上一点一滴从事艰苦工作的人。
　　全力保苗
    在天旱而没有下种的地区要突击下种，在苗已出土地区便要全力保苗。保苗，必须战胜以下几种足以威胁幼苗生存的敌人：第一是继续战胜天旱，保证苗不枯死，第二防止和扑灭虫灾。第三防风，……。去年冬暖，秋耕不普遍，加以今年天旱，各种情形均对幼苗不利，必须加倍小心保护，千万不可大意。
　　转向和平工业
    把一些不必要的战争工业及时转入和平工业，是贤明而有远见的措施，这一转变，是华北区全面和平建设全面开始的信号。同时，这也是一个新鲜而复杂的工作，决不会是一蹴而就，它包括着经营管理方法、生产方式、技术、习惯等等方面的改变，北平的经验提供了一个很好的原则即必须面向农村，为广大农民服务，制造农具和各种农业机器，这样才会开辟最大的市场。
