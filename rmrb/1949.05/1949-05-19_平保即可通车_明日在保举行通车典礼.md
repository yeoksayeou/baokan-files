　　The Ping-Bao Section Will Be Open to Traffic

  　Opening Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow in Baoding
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the greatest efforts of the liberation fighters, the Railway Corps, and the Ping-Bao Railway Construction Office, the repair work on the Ping-Bao section of the Pinghan Railway was completed ahead of schedule on May 3rd. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at Baoding Railway Station on May 20th. Starting from the 21st, one pair of ordinary passenger trains will run daily between Beiping and Gaobeidian, and one pair each of ordinary passenger trains, mixed trains, and freight trains will run between Beiping and Baoding. However, because the Pinghan line is still under construction, active repair work will continue during the day. To balance both construction work and transportation, passenger and freight trains between Ping and Bao are temporarily scheduled to run at night.

　　平保即可通车
  　明日在保举行通车典礼
    【本报讯】平汉铁路平保段抢修工作，经过解放战士们、铁道纵队与平保筑路处的最大努力，已提前于五月三日接轨，通车典礼定于五月二十日在保定车站举行，从二十一日起，以后按日于北平、高碑店间对开普通客车一对、北平保定间普通客车、混合列车、货车各一对，但因平汉路线还在工程时期，白天仍然要积极的抢修工作，在照顾工作和交通的两个条件下，所以平保间的客货列车暂时规定夜间开行。
