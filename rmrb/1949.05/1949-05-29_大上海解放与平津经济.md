　　The Liberation of Shanghai and the Economy of Tianjin and Beiping
    Qian Jiaju
    The liberation of Shanghai undoubtedly has great benefits for the economy of North China. First of all, after the liberation of Shanghai, materials can be exchanged between the North and the South. For example, the coal from Kailuan, the alkali from Yongli, the salt from Jiuda, and the cement from Qixin have all faced production difficulties due to blocked sales channels in the past. In the future, they can be transported to the South in large quantities, opening up sales channels and greatly developing the production industries of Tianjin and Beiping. At the same time, the industrial raw materials, daily necessities, and even some of the grains needed by Tianjin and Beiping can be transported from the South. In this way, the prices in Tianjin and Beiping can be further stabilized! Secondly, Shanghai is China's largest financial and trade center. After the liberation of Shanghai, Tianjin's import and export trade will have new developments. In the past, Tianjin's trade with foreign countries and South China was transshipped through Hong Kong. Now, Tianjin and Shanghai have direct shipping routes, which provides a lot of convenience in adjusting the surplus and deficiency of materials. Since the news of the liberation of Shanghai reached Tianjin and Beiping, the prices of most of the materials that can be exported to Central or South China have risen, while the prices of most of the imported raw materials and many daily necessities have fallen. The former can stimulate the development of production industries in Tianjin and Beiping, while the latter is conducive to the stability of people's lives. Naturally, this beneficial influence has only just begun. To truly transform this beneficial influence into a realistic and beneficial condition, it remains to be seen whether the economic order of Shanghai and the transportation between Tianjin and Shanghai will be restored.

　　大上海解放与平津经济
    千家驹
    上海的解放，对于华北的经济无疑地有很大的好处。首先便是上海解放后，南北物资可以交流，例如开滦的煤，永利的碱，久大的盐，启新的洋灰，过去都因销路拥塞，生产困难，今后可以大量地运销到南方去，销路打开，平津生产事业可以大大发展。同时平津所需的工业原料、日用物品甚至一部分粮食等可以南运。这样一来，平津的物价更可以稳定下来！其次，上海为中国最大之金融贸易中心，上海解放之后，天津进出口贸易当有新的发展，过去天津与国外及华南之贸易均经由香港转口，现在天津与上海直接通航，这使物资盈虚调剂上得到了很多方便。自上海解放消息传到平津后，凡是可以出口到华中或华南的物资物价大多上涨，而凡是外来原料及许多日用物品多半跌价，前者可刺激平津生产事业之发展，后者有利于人民生活之安定。自然这种有利的影响，目前还刚刚开始，真正要使这种有利的影响变成了现实的有利条件，还有待于上海经济秩序之恢复及津沪交通之恢复。
