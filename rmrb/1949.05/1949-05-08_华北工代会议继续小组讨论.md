    North China Labor Representatives Conference Continues Group Discussions
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Labor Representatives Conference continued its group discussions yesterday based on Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech and the report by Li Zaiwen, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, on "The Tasks of the North China Labor Movement." After a relatively broad exchange of opinions, the discussions have entered a specific study of important proposals such as the democratization of factory management. The representatives' speeches are becoming increasingly enthusiastic. Today is Sunday, the conference will take a day off, and will continue tomorrow.
