Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: The Kuomintang gang in Shanghai is frantically plundering the people with new and cruel methods. The bandit garrison headquarters has decided to forcibly requisition all supplies needed by the bandit army from factories and shops without paying a single cent. The plunder plan stipulates the requisition of half of the city's meat, cigarettes, large quantities of clothing, and other daily necessities. The gang has already begun transporting these requisitioned materials to the so-called "safe zone" on the 10th. The gang has also stipulated that, except for grain, fuel, and military supplies, which are not allowed to be exported for the bandit army to plunder freely, the puppet municipal government also has the right to "requisition" other daily necessities for export in exchange for materials needed by the bandit army. The puppet municipal government has ordered the Shanghai Industrial Association and the Chamber of Commerce to notify their members to report the types and quantities of stored materials in preparation for "requisition." The puppet municipal government has formed a so-called "Five-Person Committee" with the puppet Ministry of National Defense, the puppet Ministry of Finance, the puppet Central Bank, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and other units to specifically handle this "requisition" matter. In addition, the puppet municipal government has also planned to squeeze the people by levying special taxes, stipulating that each truck will be taxed 100 million puppet gold yuan, and jeeps and motorcycles will be taxed 50 million. Hundreds of trucks and jeeps were forcibly requisitioned by the bandit army on the 9th.
	
The gang continues to carry out slaughter and destruction in Shanghai. Ten more people were shot and killed in the three days of the 8th, 9th, and 11th. It is reported that thirty-seven people have been slaughtered by the Kuomintang gang in Shanghai since April 25th. The Kuomintang bandit army has demolished more bungalows and farmhouses in the western suburbs of Shanghai, and many highway bridges on the outskirts of Shanghai have also been blown up by the bandit army's demolition team.

    上海匪帮残害人民
    强征全市一半日用品
    半个月屠杀三十七人
    【新华社北平十二日电】上海国民党匪帮又以新的残酷手段疯狂掠夺人民。匪警备司令部已决定一钱不付地自工厂、商店强行征收匪军所需的一切供应品。该项掠夺计划规定征收全市一半的肉类、香烟、大量衣着及其他日用必需品。匪帮们已于十日开始把这些征收来的物资运往所谓“安全区”。匪帮们并已规定除粮食、燃料及军用物资不许出口以供匪军自由掠取外，对其他日用品，伪市府亦有权“征借”输出国外换取匪军所需用的物资。伪市府已命令沪市工业会及商会通知各同业会员呈报储存物资种类数量，以作“征用”准备。伪市府已与伪国防部、伪财政部、伪中央银行、招商局等单位组成所谓“五人委员会”，专门负责此项“征借”事宜。此外，伪市府并已计划以征收特别税的办法榨取人民，规定每辆卡车征税伪金圆券一亿元，吉普和摩托车征税五千万元。九日已有数百辆卡车和吉普车被匪军强迫征用。
    匪帮们继续在上海进行屠杀和破坏。八、九、十一三天中又有十人被枪杀。自四月二十五日以来，被上海国民党匪帮屠杀者据息已达三十七人。国民党匪军又在上海西郊拆毁了更多的平房和农舍，沪市外围的许多公路桥梁亦被匪军爆破队炸毁。
