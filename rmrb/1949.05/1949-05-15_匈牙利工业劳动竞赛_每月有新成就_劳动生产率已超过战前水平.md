    Hungarian Industrial Labor Competition
    New Achievements Every Month
    Labor Productivity Has Exceeded Pre-War Levels
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th] Budapest Dispatch: Hungarian industry is achieving new successes every month. After the nationalization of the country's key industrial enterprises, manufacturing plants and factories that were previously unprofitable have flourished in a short period of time. Judging from the results of the first few months of this year, state-owned industry, transportation, and trade are certain to produce nearly 1.8 billion forints (Hungarian currency) in profit this year. Enterprises under the Ministry of Industry have pledged to over-fulfill the state plan by producing 600 million forints in profit. Sixty-seven percent of the managers of state-owned enterprises and forty percent of the managers in the industrial sector are of worker origin, and they are successfully carrying out their duties. The labor competition is growing daily across the country. The movement of industrial innovators and rationalizers is expanding. After implementing their suggestions, state-owned enterprises will save at least 200 million forints this year. Before the nationalization of most industrial enterprises in Hungary, workers' labor productivity was only 80 percent of pre-war levels, but now labor productivity has exceeded pre-war levels by eight percent. To eliminate the shortage of skilled workers resulting from industrial development, the Hungarian Ministry of Industry is increasing the number of vocational schools and training courses to improve workers' skills and train new cadres. Since Hungary's liberation from Hitler, the number of workers employed in industry has increased from 684,000 to 1 million. The number of workers engaged in metallurgy, hardware manufacturing, and the machinery industry even exceeded the 1939 level by 35 percent last year, the mining industry by 50 percent, and the textile industry by 25 percent. In the first quarter of this year, the number of workers employed in Hungarian state-owned enterprises increased by 30,000.

    匈牙利工业劳动竞赛
    每月有新成就
    劳动生产率已超过战前水平
    【新华社北平十三日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利工业每月均有新的成就。国家重要的工业企业国有化以后，过去不生利的制造厂与工厂，在短期内就发达起来了。从本年最初几个月的结果来判断，本年国营工业、运输业与贸易业必定要生产出将近十八亿佛罗林（匈币）的利润。工业部所属各企业曾保证给国家超计划生产出六亿佛罗林的利润。国营企业百分之六十七的经理人员和工业部门百分之四十的经理人员是工人出身，他们胜利地进行他们的职责。劳动竞赛在全国正日益增涨。工业改革者与合理化工作者的运动正扩展中。国营企业在实行他们的建议之后，今年至少将节省两亿佛罗林，在匈牙利大部分的工业企业国有化之前，工人的劳动生产率不过战前水平的百分之八十，而现在劳动生产率业已超过战前水平的百分之八。为了消除工业发展所产生的技术工人的缺乏，匈牙利工业部正增设职工学校与训练班以提高工人技能和培养新干部。自从匈牙利由希特勒手中解放以来，在工业中工作的工人数目已由六十八万四千人增加到一百万人。从事于冶金、五金制造与机械工业的工人甚至在去年即已超过一九三九年水平的百分之三十五，采矿工业超过百分之五十，纺织工业超过百分之二十五。今年第一季在匈牙利国营企业工作的工人增加了三万人。
