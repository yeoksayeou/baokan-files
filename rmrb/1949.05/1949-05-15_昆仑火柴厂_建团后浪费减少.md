    Kunlun Match Factory
    Waste Reduced After Youth League Establishment
    [Jinzhong Electric] After the establishment of the Youth League in the Fenyang Kunlun Match Factory, production has greatly improved. The factory previously experienced significant waste during production. For example, in the boxing area, five boxes would be ruined for every 100 boxes of matches packed. With a daily output of ten cases of matches, 1,200 boxes would be damaged each day. Calculating each box at 2.5 Jiao in People's Currency, the daily loss amounted to 300 Yuan. However, since the formal establishment of the New Democratic Youth League on March 20th, the 29 Youth League members have played an exemplary role in production, driving the entire factory to focus on production and sparking a factory-wide surge in production competition and learning. Youth League members Wang Enqi and Dong Yangyi not only completed their own tasks but also helped to arrange and operate the machinery in the oil pot area. Youth League members Ma Ximing, Dong Yangyi, and Wang Enqi wrote a large number of characters (likely meaning they studied diligently) after work every day. Veteran worker Guo Zhonghua happily said, "Since the youth joined the League, things are much better than before. In the past, even if you advised them, they wouldn't work properly. Now, you don't even need to tell them, they just do it themselves, saving a lot of trouble!" After the female workers in the boxing area proposed a competition to save raw materials, the phenomenon of damaged boxes has almost completely disappeared despite a daily output of fifteen cases of matches. Youth League branch secretary Tian Su'e, committee member Hao Yuxiang, and group leader Hao Chunmei have not damaged a single box from March 27th to the present.

    昆仑火柴厂
    建团后浪费减少
    【晋中电】汾阳昆仑火柴厂建团后，生产大有改进，该厂生产中浪费很大，如装匣处每装一百匣火柴，即毁五个匣子，每天出十箱火柴，便要损坏一千二百个匣子，每个匣子按二点五角人民票计算，每天便要损失三百元。但厂内从三月二十日正式建立新民主主义青年团后，二十九个青年团员，在生产中都起了模范作用，使全厂工人随着紧张生产，掀起了全厂的生产竞赛与学习热潮。青年团员王恩琪、董仰义，除将自己的任务完成后，并帮助排列和油锅处御机子。青年团员马西铭、董仰义、王恩琪三人，每天下工后要写一大张字，老师傅郭忠华高兴的说：“自青年入团后，可比以前好的多了，过去你劝他也不好好干，现在不用你说自己就去做了，真是省事多了！”装匣女工处自提出节省原料竞赛后，每天出十五箱火柴，损失匣子的现象几乎完全消灭。青年团支部书记田素娥、委员郝玉香组长郝春梅，从三月二十七日至现在没有损坏一个匣子。
