　　Vivid Struggle Stories Educate Workers and Students
  　Youth Representatives' Lectures Welcomed in Beiping
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the auspices of the All-China Youth Federation and the Preparatory Committee of the Communist Youth League in Beiping, eighteen youth representatives, including combat hero Lü Shunbao, model medical worker Wang Qin'ying, and Shanghai tram worker representative Chen Nongxiang, gave lectures at twenty-one factories and schools in Beiping from the 13th to the 15th, receiving a warm welcome from workers and students.
    After combat hero Lü Shunbao spoke at one middle school, two other middle schools automatically requested that he come to speak. The originally scheduled lecture time was one hour, but it was extended three times due to enthusiastic requests from the students, resulting in a five-hour lecture. Lü Shunbao told the story of how his former tenant farmer family suffered cruel exploitation by the landlords, the abuse he suffered when he was drafted into the Kuomintang army, and his story of becoming a combat hero after he became a soldier of the Liberation Army. These stories vividly educated the students, and many were moved to tears. Lü Shunbao also used his own experience to dispel the doubts of some students: some students asked, "We were backward in the past, will the People's Government trust us now?" Lü Shunbao replied that he was a soldier of the Liberation Army, and because of his brave fighting, he became a combat hero and also a representative of the National Youth Congress. He said, "As long as you are willing to learn and can change, the People's Government is the government representing the people, how can it not trust its own people?"
    Female medical worker Wang Qin'ying of the People's Liberation Army spoke at the Third Municipal Women's Middle School about the arduous struggle of female medical personnel at the front, and many female students expressed their eagerness to do this glorious work in the future. Several female students who will graduate this summer decided to apply to Bethune Medical College. Other workers and students reflected: after listening to the speeches of these youth representatives, it was like attending a political class. They all expressed their willingness to work hard in their respective positions and emulate these youth models. (Jin Feng)

　　生动的斗争事迹教育了工人学生
  　青年代表在平讲演受欢迎
    【本报讯】在全国青联总会及青年团北平市筹委会主持下，青年代表战斗英雄吕顺保、模范医务工作者王琴英、上海电车工人代表陈农祥等十八人，曾在十三日至十五日分别到平市二十一个工厂、学校讲演，受到工人、学生热烈欢迎。
    战斗英雄吕顺保在一个中学讲话后，另外两个中学自动找来要他去讲，原定讲演时间是一点钟，三次都被同学热烈要求延长，结果讲了五个钟头。吕顺保讲了他以前那个雇农家庭遭受到地主的惨酷剥削，他被国民党拉去当兵所遭受的虐待，以及他当了解放战士以后的战斗英雄故事，这些故事活生生地教育了同学，许多人听得下泪。吕顺保又用他自身的经历破除了某些同学的疑虑：有些同学问：“我们过去是落后的，人民政府如今会不会信任我们？”吕顺保回答说，他是解放战士，因为作战英勇，当了战斗英雄，还当了全国青代大会的代表。他说：“只要肯学习，能转变，人民政府本就是代表人民的政府，哪里会不信任自己的人民呢？”
    解放军的女医务工作者王琴英在市立第三女中讲到前方女医务人员坚苦奋斗的情形，很多女学生都热切希望自己将来也能做这光荣的工作。几个将在今夏毕业的女学生决定去考白求恩医学院。其他工人、学生都反映：听了这些青年代表的讲话，好比上了政治课。他们都表示愿意在各自的工作岗位上努力向这些青年模范们看齐。 　（金凤）
