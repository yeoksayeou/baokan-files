The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sends Telegrams to Congratulate Shanghai's Liberation

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army and the workers of Shanghai, congratulating them on the liberation of Shanghai. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Generals Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army, and all commanders and fighters on the Shanghai front, and to all workers and patriotic compatriots in Shanghai:

Our southward army, crossing the Yangtze River, is invincible, sweeping away the remnants of the enemy, and capturing famous cities one after another. Following the liberation of Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Nanchang, it has now liberated Shanghai, the largest city in the country. This city, which for more than a hundred years has served as an imperialist base for oppressing and plundering the Chinese people, and for twenty-two years has been the center for the Kuomintang's collusion with imperialism to attack the Chinese people, has now been liberated by our heroic and powerful People's Liberation Army. Shanghai, with its glorious revolutionary traditions of the May Thirtieth Movement, three armed uprisings, and the War of Resistance Against Japan, has returned to the embrace of the people. Its liberation signifies the immense power of our People's Liberation Army and demonstrates that the Kuomintang's defeated troops are nearing complete destruction. With the constant transmission of good news, the whole country rejoices. We extend our warmest congratulations to you! And we extend our heartfelt greetings to the workers of Shanghai and people from all walks of life in Shanghai who have been liberated from the long-term oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang! We call on the Shanghai working class to use their great organization and discipline to unite all patriotic and democratic strata under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, to quickly establish revolutionary order, assist in the takeover work, and restore production, in order to support our liberation army to continue to advance bravely, fight to South China, and accelerate the completion of the victory of liberating all of China!
