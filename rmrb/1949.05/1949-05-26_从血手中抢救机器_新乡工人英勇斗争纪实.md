　　Rescuing Machines from Bloody Hands
  　A True Record of the Heroic Struggle of Workers in Xinxiang

　　[Taihang Telegram] Before the liberation of Xinxiang City, employees of the city's electricity, flour, and railway enterprises waged a brave and unyielding struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gangs who were plotting to destroy various buildings, protecting machines and equipment. At the Xinxiang Electric Company's power plant, on December 19th of last year, when the bandit army attempted to flee south, they prepared to place explosives, forcing thirty stonemasons to dig holes in the machine room, intending to completely destroy the generator room. At that time, worker Liu Baotai secretly slipped out of the blockade and ran to the liberated area to report to the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government, seeking a way to stop them. After a warning from the spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Headquarters, although the holes were dug, the bandits did not dare to wantonly destroy it. The stonemasons who were forced to dig the holes also emphasized the difficulty of digging the holes in order to protect the machines, deliberately dragging out the time. Six hundred holes took more than a month to dig. Comrade Liu Baotai and the factory also successively accumulated important equipment in three or four houses outside the factory, waiting for our army to liberate it and then restore it to operation. Therefore, although the two generators of one thousand and one thousand five hundred kilowatts, electrical meters, and other parts were damaged by the bandits, they can still be used with a little repair and configuration. The famous Xinxiang Flour Company, after the liberation of Kaifeng, the enemy's Joint Logistics Headquarters ordered it to dismantle the boiler, preparing to airlift it to Hankou. When the workers heard this, they secretly discussed dismantling a bad boiler that had not been used since the War of Resistance Against Japan to deal with the enemy. The workers were urgently mobilized to guard the machines, and iron nail strips and wire mesh were densely nailed to the doors and windows from the inside, and many things were piled up to block each door and window. When the enemy wanted to use the boiler pipes for fortifications, the workers secretly hid more than forty pipes in the north warehouse. The enemy was determined to destroy the Xinxiang Railway Station of the Pinghan Railway, but thanks to the persistence of the employees of the road in fighting the enemy, the losses were not great. They drove the three locomotives with better quality, 772, 774, and 1135, into the locomotive depot and blocked them with wire mesh and machinery. The workers of the engineering section, in order to protect the covered wagons, moved their families to the wagons to eat and live, guarding more than a dozen wagons intact. Tian, a material dispatcher of the section, took advantage of the enemy's absence to grab grain and, with five or six partners, buried a lot of railway equipment. The streetcar driver workers dismantled and preserved important equipment such as the traction engine and cylinder on the car. The furnace washers and locomotive wipers united and, taking advantage of the enemy's shift change, successfully jumped over the wall in just five minutes one evening, opened the door of the section chief's office, and stole the large wall clock hanging there for safekeeping. The electricians and workers also used various methods to preserve more than thirty good telephone sets. The workers of the police section secretly hid every night on the road that the bandit soldiers stealing locomotive parts had to pass, monitoring where those vandals moved the parts, remembered it, and reported it to the People's Liberation Army outside the city. Locomotive section worker Lao Zhang appeared in the name of plainclothes men of the 40th Army protecting the station and dispersed the bandit motorcade that was destroying the oil boxes. When the foundry workers saw the enemy destroying their materials and windows, they hid some of the models and furniture in the welfare primary school for safekeeping. Due to the workers' various forms of struggle to protect the railway equipment and all the machines of the flour mill, the power plant was not completely destroyed, and the three railway locomotives can be used with a little repair, which greatly facilitated the takeover and restoration of our People's Government. Now, the workers of various enterprises in Xinxiang City are assisting the military control commission in taking over and are actively preparing to resume work.

　　从血手中抢救机器
  　新乡工人英勇斗争纪实
    【太行电】新乡市电灯、面粉、铁路各企业员工，在该市未解放前，曾英勇不屈地与阴谋破坏各种建筑的国民党匪帮进行了各式各样的斗争，保护了机器与器材。新乡电灯公司的电厂，去年十二月十九日匪军企图南逃，准备按置炸药，逼令三十名石工在机器房挖眼凿洞，要将电机房彻底炸毁。当时工人刘宝太即偷偷潜出封锁线跑到解放区，向人民解放军及民主政府报告，设法制止。经人民解放军总部发言人警告后，虽洞挖成，而匪却未敢肆意炸毁。被迫挖洞的石工们为保卫机器，亦曾强调凿洞困难，故意拖磨时间，六百个洞即凿了一个多月。刘宝太同志并与厂方先后在厂外积存三四间房子的重要器材，等待我军解放后修复开工。所以一千与一千五百基罗瓦特的两部发电机、电汽表等零件，虽被匪毁坏，但稍加修理配置，仍可使用。著名之新乡面粉公司，在开封解放后，敌联勤总部即令其将锅炉拆掉，准备空运汉口。工人们听说，即暗地商量以拆卸一个在抗日战争以来就未曾用过的坏锅炉来应付敌人。工人曾紧急动员起来看守机器，并把门窗上从里面密密的上铁钉条和铁丝网，在每个门窗上还堆积了许多东西，堵塞起来。敌人要把锅炉管子作工事，工人们就暗地把四十多根管子藏到北仓库，敌人对平汉路新乡车站是要下决心破坏的，但在该路员工坚持和敌人斗争下，损失不大。他们将质量较好的七七二、七七四、一一三五等三部机车开进机车库，用铁丝网、机械等堵死。工务段的工人为保护棚车，把自己的眷属搬到车上食宿，看守十多个车皮完整无损。该段材料收发田某，乘敌人外出抢粮的空隙，和五、六个伙伴埋藏了许多铁道器材。小电车司机工人把车上的牵引机、汽缸等重要器械拆卸保存了起来。洗炉夫和擦机车夫联合起来，乘匪军换防，在一个黄昏里仅用五分钟即顺利跳过围墙，开开段长室的门，把挂着的大壁偷上存藏起来。电务段工友们并用了各种方式保存了三十多部好电话机子。警务段工人每天夜里偷偷的藏到偷盗机车零件的匪兵必经的路上，监视那些破坏者把零件搬到哪里，记起来，报告给城外解放军。机车段工友老张曾以四十军保护车站的便衣名目出现，驱散了破坏油盒子的匪汽车队。翻砂班的工友看到敌人在破坏他们的材料和窗户时，就把一部分模型和家具藏到福利小学保存起来。由于工人用各种各样的斗争方式保护了铁路器材和面粉厂的全部机器，使电厂未遭彻底破坏，铁路三部机车稍加修理则可使用，大大便利了我人民政府的接管与恢复。现新乡市各企业工人正协助军管会接管，并积极准备复工。
