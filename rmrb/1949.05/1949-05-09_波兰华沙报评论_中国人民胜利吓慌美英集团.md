Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: According to a Polish Press Agency dispatch on the 7th, a Warsaw newspaper commented on the victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, saying that these victories have caused a new wave of panic and fear in the U.S.-British imperialist bloc. Some newspapers of the American bourgeoisie are demanding that the U.S. government give more millions of dollars to the Kuomintang, while others are condemning the State Department's policies, saying "everything is lost." Similar confusion can also be seen in the British bourgeois press. This is a true reflection of the flustered panic of the highest figures in U.S.-British imperialism. They are showing particular anxiety and are no longer hiding their fears about the impact that the Chinese military situation may have on the Asian continent.

    中国人民胜利吓慌美英集团
    【新华社北平八日电】据波兰通讯社七日讯：华沙报评论中国人民解放军的胜利称，这些胜利已在美英帝国主义集团中造成惊慌与恐惧的新浪潮。一部分美国资产阶级的报章要求美政府给国民党以更多地、拨以百万计的美元，另一部分则谴责国务院的政策，并称“一切都丧失了。”在英国资产阶级报界中，也可以看到同样的混乱。这是美英帝国主义者最高级人物中手忙脚乱惊慌失措的真实反映。他们表现特别的焦虑，而且也不再隐藏他们对于中国军事形势可能给予亚洲大陆的影响的恐惧了。
