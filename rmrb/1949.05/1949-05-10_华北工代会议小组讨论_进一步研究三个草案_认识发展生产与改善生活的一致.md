    【Tianjin News】The North China Workers' Representative Congress has been conducting group discussions for four consecutive days, and basically concluded yesterday (the 9th). A plenary session will resume today. After heated discussions based on the reports by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Li Lisan, and Li Zaiwen over the past four days, the representatives have gained a clear understanding of the basic spirit of the current tasks of workers in North China. Yesterday was dedicated to further studying the "Draft Resolution on the Establishment of Collective Contracts in State-owned and Publicly Operated Enterprises in North China," the "Draft Outline of Collective Contracts for State-owned and Publicly Operated Enterprises in North China," and the "Draft Resolution on Establishing Supply Stores and Consumer Cooperatives to Guarantee the Livelihood of Workers."

    Regarding the basic spirit of the Outline of Collective Contracts for State-owned and Publicly Operated Enterprises, the representatives unanimously agreed with the draft's stipulation that it should be "signed jointly by the administrative organs of factories and enterprises and the workers' union representing all workers, based on the principles of developing production, prospering the economy, and taking into account both public and private interests." It clearly stipulates that a factory management committee should be organized to realize the democratization of factory management. In addition, in order to increase production and improve quality, the responsibilities of both the factory administration and the workers' union are defined. There are also provisions regarding wages, working hours, labor insurance, employee welfare, employee appointment and dismissal, and reward and punishment methods. During group discussions on this draft, all groups unanimously agreed that this would provide a clear basis for the responsibilities of all factory workers in developing production and taking care of the daily interests of workers. Inspired by the discussion of this issue, many representatives mentioned that because this draft resolution has quite satisfactorily taken into account the interests of workers, they proposed that workers in our state-owned and publicly operated factories should work harder today to increase production, so that factories can accumulate more capital and develop and expand production. Regarding labor insurance, representatives from Tianjin put forward many specific suggestions on marriage and funeral subsidies and subsidies for work-related injuries, illnesses, or deaths. The Beijing delegation expressed complete satisfaction with the provisions on employee welfare and labor insurance in the draft, while emphasizing that all welfare programs should take into account the factory's production situation and affordability, and should follow the spirit of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report.

    Regarding the issue of establishing supply stores and consumer cooperatives to guarantee the livelihood of workers, the draft proposed that the government implement fixed-price and rationed sales of daily necessities to workers and their families in state-owned and publicly operated enterprises, including grain, cloth, oil, salt, and coal. Private factories may also adopt the same rationing method by signing a contract with the supply headquarters established by the state trading company. All groups unanimously expressed satisfaction with this approach and put forward many specific suggestions on implementation methods.

    华北工代会议小组讨论
    进一步研究三个草案
    认识发展生产与改善生活的一致
    【天津讯】华北职工代表会议连续进行了四天的小组讨论，昨日（九日）基本上已告一段落，今天续开大会。代表们四天来根据刘少奇同志，李立三同志，栗再温三同志的报告，热烈展开讨论之后，对华北职工当前任务的基本精神已获得明确认识。昨天是进一步研究“关于华北国营公营企业订立集体合同的决议草案”、“华北国营公营企业集体合同纲要草案”及“建立供给商店与消费合作社、保障职工生活的决议草案”。
    关于国营公营企业集体合同纲要的基本精神，代表们一致同意草案上所规定的“依据发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾的方针，由工厂企业行政机关与代表全体职工的职工会，双方共同签订”。明白规定出：为实现工厂管理民主化，应组织工厂管理委员会，此外，为了增加生产部提高质量，确定了工厂行政与职工会双方的责任。关于工资、工时、劳动保险、职工福利事业、职工任用与辞退及奖惩办法等项，也都有了规定。各小组在讨论这一草案时，一致认为：这样一来对全厂职工发展生产的责任和照顾职工的日常利益也均有了明确的依据，代表们对这一问题的基本精神，在各小组里，都有充分的认识。从这一问题讨论的启发下，不少代表谈到由于这一决议草案已相当圆满的照顾到职工的利益，于是纷纷提出说：咱们国营公营工厂中的工人今天给自己干活，就应当多生产，使工厂多积累资本，能发展和扩大生产才对。在劳动保险方面，天津代表在婚丧补助和因公伤亡或生病的补助上，提出许多具体建议。北平代表团对草案上关于职工福利和劳动保险的各项规定表示完全满意，同时强调一切福利事业，都应该照顾到工厂的生产情况和负担能力。应该遵循刘少奇同志报告的精神。
    关于建立供给商店与消费合作社，保障职工生活的问题，草案上建议政府施行定价定量配售各国营公营企业职工及其家属以生活必需品，包括粮、布、油、盐、煤等。私营工厂如愿意采取同样配售办法时，可以与国家贸易公司所设的供给总店订立合同来办理。各小组对于这种办法一致认为满意，并在实施办法上，提出许多具体建议。
