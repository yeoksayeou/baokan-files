Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 9th: Cities still under the control of the Kuomintang's remaining reactionary forces are now mired in deep economic chaos. In Shanghai, prices, when calculated in pseudo-Gold Yuan, skyrocketed tenfold in a single day on the 6th of this month. The pseudo-Gold Yuan is now equivalent to waste paper, and is rejected by the vast majority of citizens. Factory owners have switched to using various products to pay wages. Workers in rat trap factories are paid with rat traps, while silk weaving workers are paid with silk products. On the 7th and 8th of this month, hundreds of thousands of workers were forced to pour into the streets, hawking their "wages" to passersby, such as rat traps, silk products, cotton fabrics, laundry soap, cloth belts, shoes, underwear, toothbrushes, and so on. This has led to an extreme deterioration in the lives of the working class and other laboring masses in Shanghai. In Qingdao, since the circulation of silver dollars at the end of last month, the only use for the pseudo-Gold Yuan was to exchange it for silver dollars and gold. However, by the 7th of this month, even this last use had disappeared. Kuomintang banks have refused to allow citizens to exchange pseudo-Gold Yuan for silver dollars, and the pseudo-Gold Yuan is now completely unable to circulate. Commerce is unusually sluggish, and money shops and banks are closing down one after another. In Fuzhou, prices have also risen like a burst dam. Rice has disappeared from the market since the 24th of last month, and the asking prices for general merchandise are chaotically high. Kuomintang warlords and bureaucrats who have fled to Fuzhou and other cities in Fujian Province are "freely occupying houses," and the people are living in constant fear. In Hankou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing and other places, prices are also rising several times a day, causing exceptional suffering for the working people and public employees.

    金圆券成了废纸
    国统区经济陷于深刻混乱
    【新华社北平九日电】尚在国民党残余反动势力控制下的各城市，现正陷于深刻的经济混乱。在上海，物价如以伪金圆券计，本月六日一天内即狂涨十倍。伪金圆券已等于废纸，为广大市民所拒用。工厂主已改用各种生产品支付工资。捕鼠机工厂的工人领到的工资是一些捕鼠机，丝织业工人领到的是丝织品。本月七日及八日，几十万的工人被迫涌向街头，向行人叫卖他们的“工资”，例如捕鼠机、丝织品、棉织品、洗衣肥皂、布带、鞋子、内衣、牙刷等等。这就造成上海工人阶级和其他劳动群众生活的极端恶化。在青岛，自上月底市面通用银元之后，伪金圆券的唯一用途是用来兑换银元黄金，但到了本月七日，连这最后的用途也失去了。国民党的银行已拒绝市民以伪金圆券兑换银元，伪金圆券已完全无法流通。商业萧条异常，钱庄银号纷纷歇业。在福州，物价亦如决堤般的上涨，上月二十四日以来大米即在市面上绝迹，百货喊价混乱不堪。逃至福州及闽省其他城市的国民党军阀官僚，正“自由占居房屋”，人民惶惶不可终日。在汉口、西安、成都、重庆等地，物价亦日涨数倍，劳动人民和公教人员异常痛苦。
