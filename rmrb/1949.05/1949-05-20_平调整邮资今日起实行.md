　　Flat Rate Postage Implemented Today
    [Ping City News] This city's Postal Administration recently received an order from the North China Postal and Telecommunications Administration stating that domestic and international postage rates will be adjusted starting today (the 20th). The details are as follows: (A) Domestic Postage: (1) General Rates: Letters, 10 yuan for every 20 grams, local; 20 yuan, out-of-town. Postcards, 5 yuan, local; 10 yuan, out-of-town. Ordinary Newspapers: 5 yuan for up to 125 grams, both local and out-of-town; an additional 5 yuan for each additional 125 grams, both local and out-of-town. Samples: 10 yuan for every 125 grams, both local and out-of-town. (2) Special Rates: Registered mail, an additional 60 yuan in addition to the ordinary rate. Priority mail, an additional 20 yuan in addition to the ordinary rate. Express registered mail, an additional 80 yuan in addition to the ordinary rate; return receipt, 40 yuan per item; inquiry fee, 50 yuan per item. (B) International Postage: (1) General Rates: Letters, 100 yuan for every 20 grams. Postcards, 50 yuan. Ordinary Newspapers: 25 yuan for up to 125 grams; an additional 25 yuan for each additional 125 grams. Samples, 50 yuan for every 125 grams. (2) Special Rates: Registered mail, an additional 300 yuan in addition to the ordinary rate. Priority mail, an additional 150 yuan in addition to the ordinary rate. Express registered mail, an additional 400 yuan in addition to the ordinary rate; return receipt, 200 yuan per item; inquiry fee, 250 yuan per item. According to the original standard for setting the postage for a domestic regular letter (within 20 grams), it was approximately equivalent to one jin of millet. Other mail rates were also increased or decreased based on this standard. This time, the domestic regular letter postage rate is adjusted to 20 yuan, which is still less than half a jin of millet. If measured by the price index, the postage is actually reduced by more than half.

　　平调整邮资今日起实行
    【平市讯】本市邮政管理局顷奉华北邮电总局令，自今（二十）日起，调整国内及国际邮资，兹分别探志于后：（甲）国内邮资：（一）一般资费：信函每重二十公分，本埠者十元，外埠者二十元，明信片本埠者五元，外埠者十元；普通新闻纸类：一百二十五公分以下本埠及外埠一律五元，续加一百二十五公分本埠及外埠一律五元；货样类：每重一百二十五公分本埠及外埠一律十元。（二）特种资费：单挂号除普通资费外另加六十元；平快信除普通资费外另加二十元；快递挂号除普通资费外另加八十元，回执每件四十元；查询费每件五十元。（乙）国际邮资：（一）一般资费：信函每重二十公分一百元；明信片五十元；普通新闻纸类一百二十五公分二十五元，续加一百二十五公分二十五元；货样每重一百二十五公分五十元；（二）特种资费：单挂号除普通资费外另加三百元；平快信除普通资费外另加一百五十元：快递挂号除普通资费外另加四百元；回执每件二百元；查询费每件二百五十元。按国内一封平信（二十公分以内）邮资的订定，原来约以小米一斤为标准，其他邮件资费亦以此为准而增减，此次国内平信邮资调整为二十元，尚不足半斤小米的价格，若衡之以物价指数，邮资反而减低了半数以上。
