Laishui Seventh District

Repairing Canals, Digging Wells, Carrying Water for Point Planting

[Chahar News] Laishui Seventh District is vigorously opening canals, repairing dams, digging wells, preparing water buckets and jars, and carrying water for drought resistance and point planting. In Yushanpu Village, there was an old canal, but last year the water washed away the dam, and the canal was buried for more than a mile. After promotion by district cadres, a total of 110 man-days were spent in two days to repair the dam completely. The canal is more than two miles long and can irrigate more than 90 mu of land. More than 20 mu of land have already been irrigated. Gaojiazhuang Village has more than 90 mu of rice paddies. Seventy mu were reclaimed last year, and 20 mu of virgin land were destroyed by water. This year, they are being reorganized, and a paddy reclamation cooperative has been organized. They reviewed the shortcomings of starting work too late last year, the masses' concerns, and the cadres' coercive orders, such as forcing work on digging canals while seedlings were being hoed. This year, it was decided to overcome past shortcomings and plan to open a large canal two and a half miles long, requiring an increase of 20 dan of grain. Work has started for three days, with a total of 57 workers digging more than 240 zhang of canals. The masses have realized the importance of developing water conservancy and are actively developing water sources. For example, two wells have been dug in Zijingguan, one old well has been repaired in Sanlipu, and five labor groups have been organized in Daxingan, making plans for carrying water for sowing, and buying twelve sets of tin buckets from Yixian. Village Chief Tang Yuzhong led eight people to open an old canal, which has now irrigated five mu of land. Jiaochang Village plans to dig an old well and prepare to purchase a waterwheel. Dongqingyuan also plans to dig a canal. Everyone regards water conservancy as an important work to prevent drought.

    涞水七区
    修渠挖井
    担水点种
    【察哈尔讯】涞水七区大力开渠、修坝、挖井，准备水桶水罐，抗旱担水点种。玉山铺村有旧渠一道，去年水将坝冲坏，渠道被填压一里多地，经过区干部推动，在两天中，共花人工一百一十个，把坝全部修好。渠有二里多长，能浇地九十多亩，现已灌地二十多亩。高家庄村有稻滩九十多亩，在去年已开出七十亩，还有生滩二十亩被水冲毁，今年重新整理，组织起修滩合作社，检讨了去年开工太晚，群众思想有顾虑，干部强迫命令，正在锄苗时强制动工挖渠等缺点，今年决定克服过去缺点，计划开大渠二里半长，要求增产二十大石。现已开工三天，共出工五十七个，挖渠二百四十多丈。群众对开展水利有了认识，纷纷开发水源。如紫荆关挖出井两眼，三里铺修旧井一眼，大兴安组织起五个拨工组，做出挑水播种计划，并从易县买洋铁桶十二付。村长汤玉仲，带领八个人开出旧有水渠一道，现已浇地五亩，教场村计划挖旧井一眼，准备购买水车。东清源也计划挖渠，大家把水利看成防止天旱的重要工作。
