    Zhengding City Workers Urgently Demand Improved Organization

    [This Newspaper’s Report] Developing the workers' movement, safeguarding workers' rights, raising workers' consciousness, and establishing and improving workers' organizations are the urgent demands of nearly a thousand workers, shop assistants, and apprentices in Zhengding City.

    In the process of starting to organize trade unions in the city recently, it was discovered that some factory owners and managers illegally infringe upon the interests of workers. The privately-owned Gongyi Cotton Factory excessively lowers wages. In the past, female workers in packaging and cotton batting could earn enough to buy two and a half jin of millet per day. Recently, prices have risen, but wages have not increased. The daily wage is now only enough to buy one and a half jin of millet, making it difficult to maintain even the minimum personal living standards. The workers who cut gauze were originally paid by the piece, but when the factory saw that the workers were exceeding their quota, they immediately switched to paying by the day. When the workers demanded to continue being paid by the piece, the manager threatened them: "Work if you want to, if not, there are plenty of other workers." On "March 8th" Women's Day, the factory originally notified that there would be a holiday with pay, but the next morning they sent people to call the workers back to work, and they were made to work until after 8 o'clock before being allowed to attend the meeting. The privately-owned Rui＠cheng Clothing Bureau mainly contracts out handicrafts and stipulates that accounts are settled every ten days. However, manager Zhang Ziying deliberately delays payments, settling accounts only twice in three months, and the accounts are unclear. Zhang himself made a mistake in the number of mosquito nets and demanded compensation from the workers. Active member He Guibin once joined workers to settle accounts with Zhang, but Zhang "struck back" and secretly ran to the city trade union to arbitrarily slander the workers.

    Although the state-owned Yufeng Flour Company established a trade union in February, it still has no work content, and very little education is conducted for the workers. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers is not seen, but the backward consciousness of individual workers is exaggerated, and it is believed that the workers are unwilling to organize a trade union. From the above facts, it can be seen that the view held in the past by some comrades that there is no industry in Zhengding and therefore the workers' movement has been neglected for a long time is wrong. How to develop the workers' movement and protect workers' welfare is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in Zhengding City. (Yao Fu)

    正定全市职工迫切要求健全组织
    【本报讯】开展职工运动，保障工人权利，提高工人觉悟，建立与健全职工组织，是正定全市近千工人、店员、学徒的迫切要求。
    该市在最近开始组织职工会的过程中，发现某些厂主、经理，非法侵害工人利益。私营公益制棉工厂，过分压低工资，包装、弹花等女工过去每天工资可买二斤半小米，最近物价上涨，但工资并未增加，每天所得工资不过斤半小米，维持个人最低生活还有困难。割纱布工人，原规定按件计工，厂方见到工人超了工，便立即变为按日计工，工人们要求仍按件计工时，经理便威吓工人：“愿作就作，不作，有的是工人。”“三八”节开会时，厂方本来第一天通知放假，工资照发，可是第二天清晨又派人找回工人，照样劳动到八点多钟，才准参加会议。私营瑞＠成衣局，以包手工为主，规定十天结帐一次，交活取钱，可是经理张子英故意拖延，三个月仅结帐两次，并且帐目不清。张自己弄差蚊帐数目，反要工人赔偿。积极分子何贵彬曾联合工人向张算帐，张便“倒打一耙”，偷偷跑到市职工会，随便诬蔑工人。
    国营裕丰面粉公司，虽在二月份建立起职工会，但至今仍无工作内容，对工人很少进行教育。看不到广大工人群众的积极性，反而夸大个别工人的落后意识，认为工人不愿组织工会。从以上事实看出，过去有的同志认为正定没有什么工业，因之长期忽视职工运动的观点是错误的，如何开展职工运动，保护工人福利，是正定市迫切需要解决的一个问题。（药夫）
