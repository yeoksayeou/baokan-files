The First Step in the Reform of Traditional Chinese Painting – Discussion on Traditional Chinese Painting (2)
Jiang Feng

The new Chinese painting exhibition currently being held in Zhongshan Park, featuring nearly eighty artists and over two hundred works, is truly a noteworthy and epoch-making event for the traditional Chinese painting circles in Beiping. It signifies that traditional Chinese painting, a feudal art form that once catered to the leisurely classes, has begun to transform into an art that serves the people. Although this is only the beginning, the first step, the gains are indeed significant. Some of the works have achieved, or are striving to achieve, depicting the lives and struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers as their themes. Furthermore, some works have broken away from the clichés of traditional Chinese painting and are moving towards becoming new art forms, pushing the traditional Chinese painting art, which was "the trace of dead emotions," onto a path of rebirth.

Whether any art can develop and be creative mainly depends on whether the art itself can be combined with the lives of the people. In the past, many who engaged in the reform of traditional Chinese painting ignored or disregarded this principle and only focused on technicalities and forms, splitting hairs, while the themes remained the same old ones. Therefore, the results were minimal; some even became immersed in the interest of brush and ink, and were disarmed by the object of reform. Thanks to the initial acceptance of the guidance of new literary and artistic thought, the authors of new Chinese paintings have found a relatively correct path from the very beginning. From this point on, the reform of traditional Chinese painting has a reliable guarantee.

Perhaps some people still use old viewpoints and old tastes to measure the value of this new Chinese painting exhibition, lamenting the destroyed elegance, grace, brush and ink interest, and formal completeness of traditional Chinese painting art, and shouting that it "has lowered the artistic value" and "has stopped art"... This lament of the declining class will never again become a force of judgment in the people's era and, like all art for the enjoyment of the idle, will be abandoned by the times.

But it does not mean that the works in this new Chinese painting exhibition are without anything to discuss. Shortcomings are inevitable at this starting point of reform. I think there are two shortcomings that urgently need to be overcome: one is the poverty of life. Although many authors enthusiastically search for themes in reality, it is undeniable that because many authors in the past were too far removed from the lives and struggles of the working people and were accustomed to the method of "building a cart behind closed doors," the images, actions, expressions of the characters they depict, and their surrounding environment are often copied from fantasies or even from old paintings. Therefore, they appear insufficiently realistic, contrived, and conceptually depicted. For example, painting peasant women as beautiful, refined, and weak like the beauties in figure paintings or the young ladies in the city. The second shortcoming is the application of old formats. The result of applying old formats in creation is that the content conforms to the form, causing the labor of peasants and the battles of soldiers, which are the themes, to become embellishments that are forcibly crammed into the picture of a vertical landscape painting; the scene of fighting southward should be passionate and tense, but it is only beautiful, peaceful landscapes and sailing boats, forming a very uncoordinated situation between content and form. If the above two shortcomings are not improved, it will be difficult to properly express the new life. The way to improve is, at the very least, to get closer to the working people, make friends with the working people, familiarize oneself with their lives, record their images, and do more sketching exercises. At the same time, seek to make thoughts and feelings mass-oriented, and humbly listen to their opinions on the works, and in turn improve the artistic expression methods.

　　国画改造的第一步　国画讨论之二
    江丰
    现在中山公园举行的、包括将近八十多个作者，出品二百多件的新国画展，这在北平的国画界实是一件应该庆贺的有划时代意义的大事情，因为它标志着那供给有闲阶级玩赏的封建艺术——国画，已开始变为为人民服务的一种艺术。这虽然仅是开始，第一步，但收获确实很大。有一部分作品，做到了或努力在做以工农兵的生活与斗争为描写的主题，而且有一些作品摆脱了国画的陈套，走向成为崭新的艺术形式，把“已死去了的情绪的陈迹”般的国画艺术，推上新生的道路。
    一切艺术能否发展，有无创造，主要是在于艺术本身与人民的生活能否结合而定，过去许多从事国画改革者，忽视或不理会这个道理，而只在技术和形式上下功夫，钻牛角尖，取材又是老一套，所以收效微小；甚至有淹没在笔墨的趣味里，被改革的对象缴了械。新国画的作者们，由于初步接受了新文艺思想的指导，一开始便找到了比较正确的道路，从此，国画的改造，就有了可靠的保证。
    或许有人仍以旧观点旧趣味去衡量这次新国画展的价值，并对已被破坏的优雅，潇洒、笔墨趣味及形式之完整等国画艺术诸特色，感到遗憾而叫嚷着“把艺术价值降低了”，“使艺术停止了”……这种没落者的哀鸣，它在人民的时代里，永远不能再成为一种评判的力量，与一切供有闲者玩赏的艺术同样，将为时代所摒弃。
    但并非等于说，此次新国画展的作品，没有可议之处了，这改革的起点，缺点是免不了的。应该指出亟待克服的缺点，我以为有如下两个：一个是生活的贫乏，虽然不少作者如何热情地在现实中搜索题材，但不可否认的，由于许多作者在过去与劳动人民的生活和斗争隔离太远，作画又习惯于“闭门造车”的方法，描写的人物之形象、行动、表情及其周围的环境，很多是从幻想甚至从旧画中抄袭来的，所以显得不够真实，做作、概念的描写。如把农妇画成仕女画中的美女或城市中的小姐那样优美、斯文和无力。第二个缺点是旧格式的套用，在创作上套用旧格式的结果，使内容迁就于形式，致使作为主题的农民的劳动和战士的战斗，表现在直条山水画格式的画面上，成了硬凑进去的点缀物；南下的战斗场面，应该热烈紧张，然而只是优美、宁静的山水和帆船，形成内容与形式极不协调的状况。上述的两个缺点，如果不加改进，就很难恰当的表现新的生活。改进的办法，至少应多去接近劳动人民，多与劳动人民交朋友，熟悉他们的生活，记录他们的形象，多作生写的练习。同时求得思想感情的群众化，并虚心听取他们对于作品的意见，反过来改进艺术的表现方法。
