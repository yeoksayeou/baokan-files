　　Ping City Launches Fly Eradication
  　Preventing Summer Epidemics
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Ping City Health Bureau, in view of the fact that summer has arrived, and the greatest enemies of the health of citizens are infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, and flies are the most powerful carriers of these germs, therefore, fly eradication and fly prevention work has become the most important task at present. Starting from May 16th, the bureau launched a fly eradication campaign, mobilizing DDT spraying teams to public places to eliminate flies. As of May 25th, 26 public toilets, 13 schools and organizations, and approximately 277,000 square feet of area have been sprayed. Primary and secondary schools have successively launched fly-swatting campaigns, and the results are being tallied. On May 23rd, the bureau convened relevant groups to discuss fly eradication methods. At the meeting, the "Interim Measures for Fly Eradication and Fly Prevention in Peiping Restaurants" were drafted, totaling eleven articles. The main purpose is to urge restaurants to pay attention to preventing or eradicating flies, such as spraying DDT, adding gauze covers to the doors and windows of food preparation areas, finished products, and seating areas, and equipping fly swatters, flypaper and other fly-catching equipment, and paying special attention to toilet hygiene. These measures will be promulgated and implemented soon. There are also reward and punishment measures for the fly prevention and eradication work of various shops to protect the health of citizens.

　　平市发动灭蝇
  　防止夏季流行疾病
    【本报讯】平市卫生局鉴于目前已届夏季，市民健康的最大敌人是霍乱、赤痢和伤寒等传染疾病，苍蝇为这些病菌最厉害的媒介物，因此灭蝇防蝇工作成了目前最重要的课题。从五月十六日起，该局特发动灭蝇运动，动员ＤＤＴ喷射队到各公共场所扑灭苍蝇。截至五月二十五日，已有公厕二十六个，学校团体十三处，约二十七万七千平方尺的地区喷射完毕。各中小学已先后展开扑蝇运动，其成绩正在统计中。五月二十三日，该局召集各有关团体商讨灭蝇办法，会上拟定“北平饮食店业灭蝇防蝇实施暂行办法”，共十一条。主要在于督促各饮食店业注意防预或扑灭苍蝇，如喷射Ｄ·Ｄ·Ｔ，制造食物、制成品及客座的门窗均须加具纱罩、添备蝇拍、捕蝇纸等扑蝇器具，尤须注意厕所卫生。该项办法不日即将公布施行。对于各店铺防蝇、灭蝇工作并定有奖惩办法，以利保卫市民健康。
