　　North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
  　Manufactures First Water Pump
  　And Will Renovate 300 Waterwheels
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has begun manufacturing various agricultural machines to meet the production needs of state-owned farms and farmers. After the factory was established on April 11, personnel were sent to the Northeast to select and purchase various agricultural machines for research and imitation. Simultaneously, a three-ton cupola furnace (for melting iron) was built, and a 30-horsepower rolling mill was repaired in preparation for manufacturing machines. Through the efforts of all employees to overcome various difficulties, one-third of the entire project for the cupola furnace has now been completed. The rolling mill is about to be repaired. The first 15-horsepower water pump, which was trial-manufactured, has been successful and can irrigate 4 to 5 hectares of farmland. Also, because this type of water pump requires electric power to operate, it is only suitable for areas near cities. Therefore, there are plans to renovate the factory's existing 300 unfinished waterwheels to meet the needs of the vast rural areas. In addition, agricultural machines purchased from the Northeast have also been transported in: these include more than ten types of machines such as binding machines, harvesters, threshers, weeding machines, chaff cutters, seed selectors, seeders, harrows, and plows, all of which are small-scale and dual-purpose (both tractor and animal-powered). The factory plans to select machines for trial manufacturing based on the specific conditions of rural North China. After successful trials, mass production will begin. At that time, farms and farmers in various regions can bring government recommendation letters to the factory to place orders.
    It is reported that the factory was formerly the Hebei Province Machine Factory, which was later renamed the Second Ordnance Repair Depot by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the People's Government immediately changed it to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to serve the development of agricultural production. (Shang Kai)

　　华北农业机械总厂
  　造成第一部水泵
  　并将改造三百辆水车
    【本报讯】华北农业机械总厂开始制造各种农业机器，以应各国营农场与农民生产之需要。该厂在四月十一日成立后，即派人至东北选购各种农业机器，研究仿造；同时建造一座容量三吨的冲天炉（化铁用）与修复一部三十匹马力的轧钢机，准备制造机器。经全体员工努力克服各种困难，现冲天炉已完成全部工程的三分之一。轧钢机即将修复。试造之第一部十五匹马力的水泵已经成功，可浇田四顷至五顷。又因此种水泵须用电力发动，只适用于城市附近地区，因此计划改造该厂原存之三百辆未制成的水车，以应广大农村的需要。另外从东北选购之农业机器亦已运到：其中有捆割机、收割机、打谷机、锄草机、铡草机、选种机、播种机、齿耙、犁等十余种，均为小型两用（拖拉机与畜力两用）。该厂拟根据华北农村之具体情况，选择试造。待试用成功后，即开始大量制造，届时各地农场与农民均可持政府介绍信至该厂订货。
    按该厂前为河北省机器厂，后被国民党反动派改为第二修械所。解放后，人民政府即将其改为华北农业机械总厂，为发展农业生产服务。（商恺）
