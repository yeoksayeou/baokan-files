　　Starting from Pigeons
    Xiao Feng

　　In Chenji, Fudong, there is a child named Wang Yanzhen. He and his two brothers raised a flock of pigeons together. One day, they saw that the neighbor's rabbits were very cute, so they sold the pigeons and bought a pair of rabbits. Since the day they bought them, the rabbits reproduced a large number, one litter per month. Later, they sold the rabbits and bought a small sow. Five months later, it gave birth to eleven piglets. Now it has given birth to three litters, earning back 1,500 jin of grain, and can also produce three cartloads of black and smelly manure every month, which has greatly helped the family. Although this is a small matter, it shows that as long as you start from increasing social property to develop the breeding industry, no matter how small the capital, there is potential for development. This principle gives us a great revelation: First, in the current situation where rural textile handicrafts are gradually being replaced by urban industries, animal husbandry and breeding have the possibility and need for universal development. Leaders in various regions should consciously organize the large-scale breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, etc. There are many benefits, great returns, and it is safe, with harvests in both droughts and floods, and it does not take much effort. Therefore, the development of animal husbandry not only directly helps agriculture, as many farmers in Yuanchao County have become rich by raising cattle and pigs, but also continuously supplies industrial raw materials such as egg yolks, milk, and bristles. Second, in order to supply a large amount of raw materials for industrial and agricultural production, we can, according to local conditions and possibilities, advocate the organization of animal husbandry cooperatives, such as establishing cattle and sheep herding cooperatives in mountainous forests, grasslands, and large areas of wasteland on the plains, and organizing greenhouse cooperatives according to the season to breed chickens, ducks, pigs, etc. in large quantities. Such production cooperatives can absorb a large number of semi-laborers to participate, combined with technical guidance, and the government can provide financial assistance, so that they can develop directly. Third, when organizing family animal husbandry, we must first dispel the farmers' mentality of being unrealistic and eager to "seek great profits." Sun Delong of Housun Village in Qinghe always plans during the winter slack season: How to engage in sideline occupations? How much money can you make? But in the end, they are all aborted because they cannot do big things (no capital, no experience) and are unwilling to do small things. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate starting from small things, focusing on long-term benefits, and explaining to farmers that producing one sheep or one pig is increasing a portion of social wealth. This process of accumulating small amounts into large amounts is the active factor in achieving "producing an inch longer."

　　从鸽子谈起
    肖枫
    阜东陈集有个小孩叫王彦真，兄弟三人伙喂着一群鸽子，一天他们见邻家的家兔非常可爱，于是便卖了鸽子买回一对家免，自买的那天起，家兔一月一窝的繁殖了一大群。以后卖了家兔，又买回一只小母猪，五个月后生了十一个小猪，现在已生了三窝，赚回粮食一千五百斤，而且每月能沤三车又黑又臭的圈粪，给了家庭很大帮助。这虽然是件小事，但说明了只要从增加社会财产着手去发展饲养业不管资本大小均有发展前途。这个道理给我们一个很大启示：一，在目前农村纺织手工业逐渐为城市工业代替的情况下，牲畜、饲养业有普遍发展的可能性与需要。各地领导应有意识的组织大量饲养牛、羊、猪、鸡等，好处很多，收益很大，又保险，旱涝得收，还不用费很大的工夫，因之，牧畜业发展，不但直接有助于农业，如元朝县已有很多农民养牛、猪致富，且会源源不断的供给蛋黄、牛奶、猪鬃等工业原料。二，为大量供给工业、农业生产原料，可根据当地条件与可能性，提倡组织牧畜合作社，如在山林草原与平原上大块草荒地区成立牧牛、牧羊合作社，并按季节组织暖房合作社，大量繁殖鸡、鸭、猪等，这样的生产合作社，可大量吸收半劳力参加结合技术指导，政府给以资金帮助，即可迳直发展起来。三、在组织家庭牧畜业时，须首先打销农民眼高手低、急于“求大利”的念头。清河后孙庄孙得龙每到冬闲时照例打算一番：如何搞副业？能赚多少钱？但结果又都被大的干不来（没资本没经验）小的不愿干而流产。因之要提倡从小处着手，从长处着眼，给农民说明生产一只羊、一只猪就是增加一份社会财富的道理，这样积少成多的生产过程，就是达到“生产长一寸”的积极因素。
