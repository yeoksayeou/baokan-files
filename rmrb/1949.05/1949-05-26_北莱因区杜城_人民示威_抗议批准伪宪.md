Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 24th—Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur (Düsseldorf reporter): People in Düsseldorf held a demonstration demanding that the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament reject the so-called "Bonn Constitution." The flags and banners of the demonstrators were written with slogans demanding German unification. Police posts could not stop the constantly arriving crowds. After North Rhine-Westphalia passed the "Bonn Constitution," two-thirds of the West German states have approved the "constitution." According to the decision of the three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, at the divisive meeting held in London last year, the "Bonn Constitution" will take effect after it is passed by a two-thirds majority of the state parliaments in West Germany.

    人民示威
    抗议批准伪宪
    【新华社北平二十四日电】德意志新闻社杜塞尔多夫记者报道：杜塞尔多夫人民举行示威要求北莱因--威斯特法利亚州议会否决所谓“波恩宪法”。示威者的旗帜和标语上写着要求德国统一的口号。警察岗哨阻挡不了不断到来的大群民众。北莱因--威斯特法利亚州通过，“波恩宪法”后，西德诸州批准该“宪法”者已达三分之二。按照美英法三国去年在伦敦举行的分裂会议决定，“波恩宪法”将在取得西德三分之二大多数的州议会通过后生效。
