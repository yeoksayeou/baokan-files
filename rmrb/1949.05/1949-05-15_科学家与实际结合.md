    Scientists Combining with Practice
    The speech of Soviet Minister of Agriculture Benediktov at the meeting of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences has given us much inspiration! In order to realize the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers' three-year plan for increasing livestock, the three thousand agricultural research institutions throughout the Soviet Union will help farmers in collective farms and state farms increase livestock. This is an unprecedented plan in which so many scientists are mobilized to work with farmers in practical work to increase livestock!
    Pigs weighing eight hundred catties, sheep weighing more than two hundred catties, horses with extra heavy loads, and cows with abundant and high-quality milk have all been discovered by Soviet agricultural scientists. However, these excellent breeds are not just placed there for appreciation and display, but must be mass-produced and popularized with the help of scientists and the hard work of farmers, so that every Soviet citizen can drink enough fresh milk, eat enough meat and eggs, and further improve their living standards. This is a typical example of scientists combining with practice to increase national wealth and improve people's lives. Without this, "science" would lose its meaning!

    科学家与实际结合
    苏联农业部长比尼狄克托夫在列宁农业科学院会议上的演说，给了我们不少启发！为了实现联共中央及苏联部长会议的增殖牲畜三年计划，全苏的三千个农业研究机关，将帮助集体农场与国家农场的农民增殖牲畜。这是一个空前未有的，这么多科学家动员起来在实际工作中和农民一起为增加牲畜而努力的计划！
    八百斤重的猪，二百多斤重的羊，载重特多的马，乳汁多而精良的牛，这些最优良的品种已经苏联农业科学家发现出来，但这些优良的品种不是摆在那里欣赏做样，而是要经过科学家的帮助，农民的辛勤劳作，大量地普遍地繁殖起来，使每一个苏联公民都能喝到足够的新鲜乳汁，吃到足够的肉和鸡蛋，生活水准进一步的提高。这是一个典型的科学家与实际相结合以增加国家财富提高人民生活的范例，不如此，“科学”便要失去了它的意义！
