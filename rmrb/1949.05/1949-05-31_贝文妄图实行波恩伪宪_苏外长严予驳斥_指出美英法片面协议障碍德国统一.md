Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th: According to TASS, Paris: On May 28th, the four foreign ministers held their sixth meeting in a week, chaired by British Foreign Minister Bevin. The meeting continued to discuss the first item on the agenda: "The issue of German unification, including economic principles, political principles, and Allied control."

　　At the beginning of the meeting, Bevin, representing the three Western countries, put forward proposals on the issue of German unification. Bevin first stated that four years had passed since the signing of the Potsdam Agreement. During this period, Germany "has changed." "Now, the Western countries have reached a certain stage, which affects our method of solving today's problems." Here, Bevin alluded to the measures implemented by the U.S., Britain, and France in the West German occupation zones. Bevin attempted to portray the measures forcibly imposed by Western countries on the West German occupation zones as progressive, saying: "The initial stage of the occupation has passed, and we must move forward." Subsequently, Bevin, representing the Western countries, proposed the establishment of an "All-German Federal Government." This proposal pointed out that German unification must be realized in accordance with the "Bonn Basic Law" (referring to the so-called West German constitution passed in Bonn and approved by the U.S., British, and French occupation authorities). The proposal suggested that the states in the Eastern occupation zone join the "Bonn Basic Law." The proposal also stipulated that the "occupation regulations on a four-power basis" should be extended to all of Germany. Although it is well known that these occupation regulations for the West German occupation zone, drafted by representatives of the U.S., Britain, and France in Washington, are "regulations" that enslave the West German people and place West Germany in a state of indefinite occupation.

　　The proposal intends to fundamentally revise the regulations on four-power control. The proposal emphasizes that control should be exercised by the "High Commission," which must make decisions by majority vote, and only in special circumstances should issues be resolved by mutual agreement. The proposal stipulated that the Soviet-American-British agreement on German reparations in Yalta should be amended, stating: "Reparations are not required to be paid from current production or existing inventory."

　　Acheson then spoke, emphasizing that the proposal was put forward in the name of the three countries, and they had already reached an agreement among themselves. He insisted that this should help achieve a four-power agreement. Acheson finally considered it necessary to give the Germans an opportunity for "autonomy."

　　Schuman said that he fully supported the opinions of Bevin and Acheson.

　　Vyshinsky, after pointing out that Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman emphasized the possibility of giving the German people the opportunity to handle their affairs themselves without foreign trusteeship, said that this was nothing new. Vyshinsky reminded that as early as the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in December 1947, the Soviet delegation, precisely based on this position, strived to win Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault over to the Soviet side. However, the U.S., British, and French delegations did not support the Soviet delegation's opinion at that time. Now, they are here describing what the Soviet delegation proposed eighteen months ago as if it were their own latest achievement. In reality, this is just a belated acknowledgment of their mistakes. It is better late than never. However, what is bad is something else. What is bad is that this principle is now used with many such words, which actually greatly cancels out all verbal statements. Subsequently, Vyshinsky referred to Acheson's words, who had just emphasized that the proposal put forward by Bevin was agreed upon by the three Western countries, emphasizing that this "is a very important fact." Therefore, they believe that the fact that the three countries have reached an agreement themselves is an advantage. However, Vyshinsky believes that this is not an advantage, but a weakness, because the three delegations have established an agreement behind the back of the fourth delegation, while the issue must be resolved on a four-party basis. Here, it may even create the impression that the three parties have reached an agreement themselves and want the fourth party to consider their proposal as a fait accompli. Vyshinsky mentioned the essence of the U.S., British, and French proposals, saying that these proposals are indeed worth studying. However, even a brief glance at these documents shows that they are compiled in an extremely one-sided manner. This situation makes it very difficult to discuss documents presented as the basis for a four-power agreement. In my opinion, this obstacle—about which I will make a detailed statement after a detailed study of this document—makes the proposals put forward at today's meeting very unsuitable or even completely unsuitable as the basis for reaching a general agreement.

### 贝文妄图实行波恩伪宪　苏外长严予驳斥  指出美英法片面协议障碍德国统一

　　贝文妄图实行波恩伪宪
  　苏外长严予驳斥
    指出美英法片面协议障碍德国统一
    【新华社北平三十日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：五月二十八日，四国外长举行开会一周来第六次会议，英外长贝文任主席。会议继续讨论议程的第一项：“德国统一问题，包括经济原则、政治原则及盟国管制”。
    会议开始时，贝文代表三西方国家提出关于德国统一问题的建议。贝文首称，自波茨坦协定缔结以来，四年已经过去。在这一期间，德国“发生了变化”。“现在，西方国家已达到了一定的阶段，这影响我们解决今天问题的方法。”这里贝文暗指美、英、法在西德占领区实行的措施。贝文企图把西方国家强施于西德占领区的措施说成是进步的，他说：“占领的初期已经过去，我们要前进。”其后，贝文代表西方国家建议成立“全德联邦政府”。这个提案指出，德国的统一必须按照“波恩根本法”（指在波恩通过而经美英法占领当局批准的所谓西德宪法）予以实现。提案人建议东占区各州加入“波恩根本法”。该提案又规定把“占领法规在四国基础上”扩大到全德。虽然尽人皆知，这一为美英法代表在华盛顿起草的西德占领区占领法规，是奴役西德人民并使西德处于无限期被占领地位的“法规”。
    该提案拟根本修改关于四国管制的规定。提案中强调管制应由“高级委员会”执行，这个委员会又必须按大多数表决方法作决定，只是在特殊情况下，才以互相协议的方法解决问题。该提案规定修改苏美英在雅尔塔关于德国赔偿的协定说：“不要求以现行生产或以现有存货支付赔偿”。
    艾奇逊继起发言，他着重指出，提案是以三国的名义提出的，他们自己之间已获协议。他硬说这应该助成达到四国协议。艾奇逊最后认为有必要给德国人以“自治的”机会。
    舒曼说，他完全支持贝文与艾奇逊的意见。
    维辛斯基在指出贝文、艾奇逊及舒曼强调必须予德国人民以不受外国托管而自行处理他们事务的可能性之后说，这并不是什么新奇的东西。维辛斯基提醒，早在一九四七年十二月伦敦外长会议时，苏联代表团就正是本着这一立场，努力争取马歇尔、贝文和比杜尔到苏联这方面来的。可是，美英法代表团当时不支持苏联代表团的意见。现在，他们却在这里把苏联代表团在十八个月以前就提出来了的东西说成好象是他们自己的最新成就。而实际上，这只是对他们所犯错误的过晚的承认而已。晚做总比完全不做好。但是，坏的是另外一些东西。坏的是这个原则现在用了不少这样的词句，它实际上大大取消了一切口头的声明，其后维辛斯基提起艾奇逊的话，艾奇逊刚才强调贝文提出的提案是经西方三国协议的，强调这一点“是很重要的事实”。因此，他们认为三国自己已经获得协议这一事实，乃是事情的一个优点。然而，维辛斯基认为，这并不是什么优点，这倒是一个弱点，因为三个代表团背着第四个代表团成立了协定，而问题却非要在四方的基础上不能解决。这里，甚至还可能造成这样一种印象，即三方自己取得了协议，作为一个既成事实要第四方考虑他们的建议。维辛斯基提及美英法建议的本质说，这些建议的确值得研究。但是，甚至只对这些文件略一浏览，就表明它们是极端片面地编纂出来的。这种情形使得讨论提出作为四国协议之基础的文件大为困难。在我看来，这个障碍--关于它，我在详细研究了这个文件之后，还要作详尽的发言--使得今天会上提出的提案很难适合甚至完全不适合作为达到总的协议的基础。
