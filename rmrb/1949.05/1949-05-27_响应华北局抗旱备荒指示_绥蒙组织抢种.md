　　Responding to the North China Bureau's Instructions on Combating Drought and Preparing for Famine
  　Suiyuan-Mongolia Organizes Emergency Planting
    [Suiyuan-Mongolia Electric Dispatch] After the People's Daily, carrying the North China Bureau's instructions on drought-resistant production, economy, and preparing for famine, arrived in Suiyuan-Mongolia on the 22nd, the Regional Party Committee immediately convened a meeting, transferring more than 160 cadres from the Regional Party Committee, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Government, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Party School, and the Suiyuan-Mongolia Administrative Cadre School to form five emergency planting work groups, which were dispatched to five counties including Jining and Fengzhen. Comrade Su Qianyi, Deputy Secretary of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Regional Party Committee, personally led a group to the countryside to help the masses with emergency planting. Before the work groups went to the countryside, the Regional Party Committee pointed out that drought-resistant production is the central task that overrides all other work at present. In addition to helping the masses with emergency planting, comrades going to the countryside should personally carry water and cook meals, and not cause trouble for the masses. At the same time, the following points should be achieved: First, persuade the masses to plant dryland crops and plant more drought-resistant crops such as millet and sorghum, and let the masses understand the principle of "promoting seedlings is half of animal husbandry." Second, immediately start digging canals, diverting mountain springs, and fighting against the drought. Third, help the masses organize ox teams and voluntary labor exchange. Fourth, overcome the masses' waiting mentality of "relying on the heavens for food" and expose the rumors of special agents and the Yiguandao sect. Fifth, publicize and promote thrift to the masses. Sixth, pay attention to preventing livestock diseases, introduce folk remedies to the masses for treatment, and when medicines are not available, first isolate sick livestock to avoid infection.

  　绥蒙组织抢种
    【绥蒙电】载有华北局抗旱生产节约备荒指示的人民日报，于二十二日来到绥蒙后，区党委立即召开会议，抽调区党委、绥蒙政府、绥蒙党校、绥蒙行政干部学校等机关干部一百六十多人，组成五个抢种工作组，分赴集宁、丰镇等五县。绥蒙区党委副书记苏谦益同志亲自率领一组下乡帮助群众抢种。各抢种工作组下乡前，区党委指出抗旱生产是当前压倒一切工作的中心任务。下乡同志除帮助群众抢种外，应亲自动手挑水做饭，不要给群众添麻烦。同时要做到如下几点：一、说服群众干种，多种小日月糜黍等耐旱庄稼，要群众了解促苗一半牧的道理。二、立即动手开水渠、引山泉、与旱灾作斗争。三、帮助群众组织结合牛犋自愿变工。四、克服群众“靠天吃饭”的等待思想，揭露特务、一贯道谣言。五、向群众宣传提倡节约。六、注意防止牲畜疾病，给群众介绍治疗偏方，买不到药时，首先使患病牲畜隔离，以免传染。
