　　【Taiyuan Dispatch】The Taiyuan Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government have established a preparatory office for the People's Representative Conference, actively preparing to convene the Taiyuan Municipal People's Representative Conference. Invitation letters were issued on May 14th, inviting people from all walks of life to participate, including representatives from workers, democratic parties, the press, cultural circles, industry, commerce, youth, and women.
    【Taiyuan Dispatch】In order to promptly assist unemployed workers and the impoverished in Taiyuan, the Taiyuan branch of the People's Bank of China, in conjunction with the Production Self-Salvation Committee and district governments, organized and mobilized unemployed workers and the poor in the first, second, third, fourth, and eighth districts to engage in production for self-salvation on April 28th. From April 28th to May 11th, in a period of fourteen days, the above five districts loaned a total of 519,500 yuan to 530 households, engaging in production such as grinding tofu, boiling salt, blacksmithing, selling vegetables, and small-scale cooked food, resolving the livelihood issues of 2,000 people. Kang Yongfu's family of two, from Banpo Street, used to beg for food every day before liberation. After receiving a loan of 1,000 yuan, one person gathered scrap cloth outside while the other made cloth soles at home for shoes, selling them to the military shoe factory. They were able to earn eight jin of millet per day, and after deducting the daily consumption of the two people, they still had a surplus of five jin of millet.
