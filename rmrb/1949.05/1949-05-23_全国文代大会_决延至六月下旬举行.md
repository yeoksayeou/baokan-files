　　National Literary and Art Congress
  　Decided to Postpone to Late June

    [Ping City News] The All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, originally scheduled to be held in Ping on June 5th, has been postponed to late June because some delegates from various regions are unable to come to Ping on schedule due to transportation difficulties. Consequently, the performances by national drama workers and the National Art Exhibition, which the preparatory committee for the Literary and Art Congress had been preparing for next month from the 1st to the 30th, have also been postponed.
