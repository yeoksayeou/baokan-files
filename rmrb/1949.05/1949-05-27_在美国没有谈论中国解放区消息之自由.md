　　No Freedom to Discuss News from Chinese Liberated Areas in the United States
    Fú Yīng
    The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made the American rulers tremble. They are afraid that the American people will know the truth about the Chinese liberated areas, and attempt to cover up the truth from the world, using the threats of secret agents to establish a steel curtain of news on the American West Coast, preventing news from the Chinese liberated areas from entering the United States. On April 1, 1949, the "San Francisco Call-Bulletin" revealed this conspiracy:
    "When the first ship carrying cargo from a port occupied by the Chinese Communists arrived in San Francisco, military intelligence personnel imposed a news blockade. The ship was the 7,200-ton 'China Victory,' owned by Pacific Far East Line, which arrived at Pier 8 at 8 a.m. from Tianjin, carrying seven evacuees from Shanghai. Captain Smith and his 49 crew members were interrogated by reporters, and they were warned not to discuss the situation in Tianjin with anyone other than military intelligence personnel. Tianjin was occupied by the Chinese Communists several months ago."
    So much for America's so-called freedom of speech and freedom of the press!

　　在美国没有谈论中国解放区消息之自由
    福英
    中国人民解放军的胜利，使得美国统治者发抖了。他们害怕美国人民知道中国解放区的真相，企图一手掩住天下目，用特务的威吓来在美国西海岸建立一道消息的钢幕，不让中国解放区消息传入美国。一九四九年四月一日“旧金山呼号新闻报”把这一阴谋泄露了：
    “当第一艘从中共占领的港口运货抵旧金山的船到达此间时，军事情报人员就加以消息封锁了。这艘船是太平洋远东轮船公司所有的七千二百吨的‘中国胜利号’，于上午八时由天津到达第八号码头，载有由上海撤退者七人。船长斯密士及其船员四十九人被报人员所讯问，他们被警告不许与军事情报人员以外的任何人讨论天津的情形。天津是在几个月以前为中共所占领的。”
    美国的所谓言论自由、新闻自由，原来如此！
