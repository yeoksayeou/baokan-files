Editorial Postscript

"Hurry Up," For Whom?
    To increase productivity, the Bulgarian Trade Union has established over a hundred technical training classes for workers in Sofia and Varna, hoping to improve workers' skills, rationalize production, and produce more useful tools and goods for the people.

    The American "Ford Kings" have implemented a "hurry up system," causing workers to rapidly become disabled, age, and even die young. Now, 150,000 auto workers, breaking through the conspiracies and obstructions of right-wing labor traitors, are resolutely striking to oppose this cruelly exploitative "hurry up system."

    “赶快”，为了谁？
    保加利亚的职工会为了提高生产率，在索非亚和发那分别办了一百多个职工技术训练班，希望职工技术进步，使生产合理化，多多的生产好用具，好东西，供给人民使用。
    美国的“福特大王”们实行了“赶快制度”，使工人们迅速残废衰老以至短命，现在十五万汽车工人为了反对这一残酷压榨的“赶快制度”，冲破右翼工贼们的阴谋阻挠，坚决的罢工。
