    Military Commission of the Railway Ministry Issues Circular to All Railway Lines
    Repair Roadbeds to Prevent Flood Damage
    And Rectify Scattered Railway Materials in Various Regions by a Set Deadline
    [This News Report] The Railway Ministry of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission recently issued a circular to all railway lines, requiring them to concretely plan and conscientiously and responsibly handle the work of consolidating roadbeds and preventing flood damage, and to rectify scattered railway materials in various regions by a set deadline. At present, there are still many defects and unfinished tasks in terms of lines and bridges in various regions, which need to be resolved urgently. Especially before the rainy season, attention must be paid to consolidating roadbeds and preventing flood damage, so as to ensure that no accidents occur on the lines during the rainy season, bridges are not washed away, and normal traffic is maintained. The following tasks must be done especially well before the rainy season: (1) Correct irregular curves, gradients, and bent rails. (2) Add ballast, strengthen tamping and track maintenance work. (3) Widen substandard roadbeds and tamp soft areas. (4) Organize drainage equipment and fill in pits near the lines. (5) Study flood control measures and prepare flood prevention equipment. All steel rails, wheels, locomotives, boilers, and various parts abandoned beside the road, in ditches, and in rivers must be collected, concentrated, inspected, registered, and stored separately. The Railway Ministry ordered the Tianjin-Pukou, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and Zhengzhou Railway Administrations to earnestly implement the above work and submit a written report by the end of June. At that time, the Railway Ministry will send people to inspect various regions. If any personnel or units are found to be irresponsible in this work, they will be given due punishment.
