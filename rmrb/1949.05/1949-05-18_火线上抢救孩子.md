Rescuing a Child on the Front Lines

　　The artillery fire was so intense that the earth and hilltops were shaking, the birds in the sky were frightened and flying haphazardly, and the black smoke and dust raised by the artillery fire submerged the entire city of Taiyuan. In the distance, only the brick tops of the Twin Pagodas on the east side of the city stood out in the sea of smoke and mist. Apart from that, there was nothing but exploding smoke, heavy fog, and the glare of steel. On the 11th, the People's Liberation Army fought to the South Gate of Taiyuan. Li Shuchang, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of a certain regiment of the attacking troops, led four company-level cadres to look at the terrain outside the Shouyi Gate amidst the overwhelming artillery fire. When they reached San Tiao Jie, they heard a child crying. They looked and saw a child, less than one year old, crawling on the ground and crying. At this time, the enemy on the city wall was using firepower to block the street, and the north end of the street had been set on fire by the enemy. The child's face was covered in dirt, and he was crying until his voice was hoarse. As soon as Battalion Commander Li saw this, he immediately braved the enemy's artillery fire, picked up the child, passed through the blockade line, and carried him along the deep communication trench to the battalion headquarters. Battalion Commander Li washed the child's face and asked the通讯员 to buy three eggs and mix them with boiled water to feed her. He put her on his lap. This was a child less than one year old, with a face full of small bumps, staring at Battalion Commander Li with two small round eyes. During the last time he was looking at the terrain, Battalion Commander Li met an old lady in an air-raid shelter. She said, "The child's mother went home to get something and will be back soon." Battalion Commander Li said, "When she comes back, please wait, we will go to the front to take a look." When he returned after looking at the terrain, Battalion Commander Li saw the child's mother. She was in a trance, constantly looking back at the raging flames outside the South Gate. She followed Battalion Commander Li, braving the enemy's artillery fire, and walked to the battalion headquarters. The child looked at her, and she looked at the child. Suddenly, she burst into tears. Comrades asked her if she was heartbroken seeing the child? She shook her head, and everyone comforted her: "Taiyuan is about to be liberated, don't be sad." But she cried even harder. She accused Yan Xishan of how he had ruined her family: "We are from Cang County, Hebei. Our family was not well-off, so we moved to Taiyuan and lived in Wushanwan. Her father (referring to her own husband) did petty business. A few days ago, Yan Xishan's dog soldiers said that her father had stolen someone else's things and arrested him and forced him to become a soldier. The north end of our street is right next to the city wall. The enemy was afraid that the People's Liberation Army would attack the city, so they burned a row of houses along the city wall early this morning, saying that if they burned the houses, the People's Liberation Army would not be able to reach the bottom of the city wall all at once. They robbed things while burning, and her father's broken cart for doing business, a silver dollar, and four pounds of rice were also robbed. I just wanted to get some things out, so I left the child at the entrance of the alley." Battalion Commander Li said: "Don't be sad, we will avenge you. The child's father has been arrested, we will help you find him after Taiyuan is liberated." She said: "I never thought the People's Liberation Army would save my family. You are really our saviors!" When she left, she wiped away her tears, reluctant to part.

　　火线上抢救孩子
    炮火打的这样激烈，大地和山头都在震动，天空的鸟儿震得胡乱飞腾，炮火的黑烟和掀起的尘土淹没了整个太原城，远处望去只有城东面双塔的砖顶耸立在烟雾的云海之中，除此以外尽是爆烟、沉雾和钢铁的＠照。十一日解放军打到太原南关，攻城部队某团二营营长李树昌带着四个连级干部，在这迷天的炮火中，到首义门外看地形，他们走到三条街时，听到孩子的哭声，一瞧，那是一个不满一生日的孩子爬在地上直哭，这时候城墙上的敌人用火力封锁着这条街，街的北头被敌人用火点着了，小孩满脸泥土哭得嗓子都哑了。李营长一见立即冒着敌人的炮火把孩子抱起来，通过封锁线，沿着纵深的交通沟抱到营指挥所。李营长给孩子洗了脸，叫通讯员买三个鸡蛋用开水冲了喂她。把她放在膝头上，这是一个不满一周岁的孩子，满脸小疙瘩瞪着两个小圆眼看着李营长，李营长在最后一次看地形的时候，在防空洞中碰到一个老太太，她说：“孩子的母亲回家去拿东西了，一会就来。”李营长说：“她回来请等等我们到前边去看看。”看完地形回来，李营长见到了孩子的母亲，她精神恍惚，不时回顾南门外熊熊的火焰，她跟着李营长，冒着敌人的炮火，走到营指挥所，孩子看着她她看着孩子，突然间她哇的一声哭了，同志们问她是不是见了孩子心痛？她摇摇头，大家安慰她：“太原快解放了别难过。”可是她哭得更厉害了，她控诉了阎锡山怎样害得她家破人亡：“俺们是河北沧县人，家中不济，才搬到太原来，就住五山湾，她爹（指她自己的丈夫）做小买卖，前几天阎锡山狗子军说她爹偷了人家的东西，抓进城去当了兵，俺们这条街北头紧挨着城墙，敌人怕解放军攻城，今天刚亮就把挨城墙根的一片房子烧了，说烧了房解放军就不能一下子到城根底下，一边烧一边抢东西，她爹做买卖的一辆破车子和一块白洋、四斤米，也被抢去了，我光想弄出点东西来，就把孩子放在胡同口了。”李营长说：“不用难过，我们给你报仇，孩子的父亲被抓了，解放太原帮你找他。”她说：“想不到解放军救了俺一家子，你们真是救命的恩人呀！”临走时她擦着眼泪恋恋不舍。
