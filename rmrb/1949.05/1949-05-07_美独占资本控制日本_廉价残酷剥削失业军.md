    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th - Tokyo dispatch: American major monopoly capital companies are making large investments in Japan's chemical, textile, woodworking, ceramics and other export-related industrial sectors. It is reported that the American Ford Company invested 350 million US dollars in Japan's chemical and ceramic industries alone last year, while the American electrical machinery trust invested more than 400 million US dollars in the Japanese electrical industry. Citibank and Chase Bank, through the intermediary of the Export-Import Bank, have lent large sums to Japan, specifically for the purchase of cotton in the United States.

    The method by which American monopoly capital plunders Japan, in addition to American commodities monopolizing the Japanese market, is to use America's surplus raw materials and Japan's cheap labor to manufacture their goods in Japan. In this way, American monopoly capitalists reap double profits from these industrial investments. First, they sell America's expensive surplus raw materials. Second, they sell goods manufactured using Japan's cheap labor. In order to ensure high profits, American monopoly capital stipulates that 70% of textiles made from American cotton must be exported to Southeast Asia and other countries, and strictly restricts Japanese industrial product consumption. At the same time, American monopoly capital is trying to maintain colonial-style cruel exploitation of the Japanese working class. It is reported that when the Hoffman delegation visited Japan, it suggested to MacArthur that a twelve-hour workday be implemented, the wages of child and female workers be reduced, the activities of trade unions be restricted and supervised by the government, labor laws be revised, and a large unemployed army be maintained in Japan to further cheapen labor in industry, especially in the light industrial sectors that manufacture export products.

    Facts show that the American imperialist policy of "supporting Japan" is only for the benefit of American monopoly capital and its loyal Japanese compradors. Under the complete control of the American occupiers, the commodities that Japan exports to Southeast Asia and other countries are limited to commodities that cannot compete with American goods, including many necessities that Japan urgently needs domestically. The United States is planning to ban the import of Japanese silk fabrics, which will be a serious blow to the Japanese silk industry.

    美独占资本控制日本
    廉价残酷剥削失业军
    【新华社北平五日电】东京消息，美国各大独占资本公司正对日本化学、纺织、制木、陶器等与出口有关的工业部门，进行大量投资。据称：美国福特公司仅去年一年中就对日本化学与陶器业投资三亿五千万美元，而美国电气机械托拉斯则在日本电气业中投资四亿美元以上。花旗银行与大通银行经过进出口银行的媒介，已借给日本大宗贷款。专作在美国购买棉花之用。
    美国独占资本在日本掠夺的方法，除了美国商品垄断日本市场以外，便是要想以美国的过剩原料和日本工人的廉价劳动力，在日本制造他们的商品。这样，美国独占资本家便在这些工业投资中，攫取了双重的利润。第一是销出了美国昂贵的过剩原料。第二是售出了利用日本廉价劳动力制造出来的商品，为了保证高额利润，美国独占资本规定以美棉制成的纺织品，百分之七十均须输出至东南亚等国，并严格限制日本的工业品消费。同时，美国独占资本力图对日本工人阶级保持殖民地的残酷剥削方式。据悉，霍夫曼代表团访日时曾向麦克阿瑟建议实行十二小时工作日，减低童工女工工资，由政府限制与监督工会的活动，修改劳工法，并在日本经常保持庞大的失业军。以便在工业中特别是制造出口品的轻工业部门中，使劳动力进一步廉价。
    事实表明：美国帝国主义的“扶植日本”政策，只是为着美国独占资本及其忠实的日本买办的利益，在美国占领者完全控制下，日本向东南亚及其他国家输出的商品，仅限于不能与美货竞争的商品，其中包括许多是日本国内所急需的必需品。美国正计划禁止日本丝织品输美，这将是对日本丝织业的严重打击。
