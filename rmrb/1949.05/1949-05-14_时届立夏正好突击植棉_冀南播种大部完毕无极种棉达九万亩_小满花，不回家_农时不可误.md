    [Jinan Electric] Party and government leaders at all levels in Southern Hebei have gone deep to educate and overcome farmers' conservative self-sufficiency mentality, organizing all forces to launch a crash planting of cotton and peanuts. It is understood that cotton planting plans have been largely completed in most areas. The Third Special District has completed all planting, the Fourth Special District has completed 80 percent, and in the First Special District, Shen County's fourth and seventh districts have completed three-fifths. Many villages in counties such as Wuxun and Yongzhi have exceeded their plans. The entire region is now organizing all forces to rush planting. Initially, the masses had many concerns: some farmers believed that even gold was worthless in lean years and wanted to reduce cotton and peanut planting; some farmers found planting difficult due to drought, and spot planting would require more labor and tools, causing some village cadres and party members to lose confidence. After cadres went deep and patiently mobilized, these ideas were gradually overcome. The Nangong County Party Committee took the experience of old farmers' spot planting, scientifically improved it, and promoted spot planting throughout the county. The Third Special District mobilized party and government cadres to write two letters each to relatives and friends, mobilizing spot planting, which proved very effective. Party and government organs at all levels dispatched a large number of human and animal resources to assist planting, which greatly encouraged the masses. At the same time, leaders at all levels emphasized earnestly helping farmers solve specific difficulties. According to the urgency of spot planting time and the dispersion of labor, the village cadres and party members of Yawo Village, Wei County, set an example, patiently explaining the necessity and benefits of mutual assistance to the masses, and seized the initiative to connect and organize 27 spot planting teams, completing the task of spot planting 288 mu of cotton. Afterwards, the farmers said, "That's how you do it fast!" Some areas organized women and children to participate in spot planting to complete the task as early as possible. The seventh district of Shen County mobilized more than 70 percent of women to participate in spot planting.
    [Jizhong News] With Grain Full approaching and cotton planting time pressing, Wuji County inspected the completion of the county's cotton planting plan, mobilizing all county cadres to make a final crash planting effort to strive for the completion of the plan. Wuji was originally a cotton-producing area, but after the Anti-Japanese War, due to the division and blockade by the Japanese invaders and their plundering, coupled with poor sales channels, cotton production greatly decreased. This year, according to the requirements of higher authorities and the county's own situation, it is planned to restore cotton production to 24 percent of the county's cultivated land area (before the Anti-Japanese War, cotton fields accounted for more than half of the county's total land area, but after years of destruction by the enemy puppets, cotton planting land accounted for only about 10 percent), with a specific number of 133,734 mu. Through the efforts of cadres and the masses throughout the county, more than 96,000 mu of cotton have been planted, accounting for more than 20 percent of the county's cultivated land area. Among them, the Sixth District is better, having exceeded the plan. There are still a few districts and villages that have not completed the task, and they are now making a tense crash planting effort.
    The main reasons why the districts and villages that have completed the task better are: First, the county, district, and village cadres have strong leadership and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, when the county party committee found that the leadership of the Fourth District was floating and unable to go deep, it immediately adjusted a part of the force to strengthen the leadership. Second, branch party members have clear ideas and strengthen their leading role, promoting the masses with exemplary actions. Third, seize the three key links before sowing—the preparation of seeds, the inspection of reserved cotton land, and the specific preparation for drought prevention. Conduct specific in-depth inspections of farmers to ensure the implementation of the plan. Fourth, promptly convene various meetings to inspect and promote, criticize and praise, and encourage cotton planting enthusiasm. Fifth, break the masses' ideological concerns through accounting methods and specific publicity. Based on the completion of the task, the county party committee proposed that all cadres should be mobilized urgently to make another effort to complete the cotton planting task by crash planting, and strive to exceed the plan. It is necessary to ensure that wells, waterwheels, windlasses, and human and animal resources are all utilized without idle time, watering, spot planting, and rushing planting day and night. The backward districts and villages should learn from the Sixth District. The entire county is now making a tense crash planting effort according to the instructions of the county party committee, and the remaining task of more than 40,000 mu is expected to be completed exceeding the planned amount.

    时届立夏正好突击植棉
    冀南播种大部完毕无极种棉达九万亩
    “小满花，不回家”农时不可误
    【冀南电】冀南各地党、政领导干部，深入教育克服农民自给自足的保守思想，组织一切力量，突击点种棉花、花生。据了解，种棉计划大部地区已完成，三专区全部完成，四专区完成百分之八十，一专区莘县四、七区已完成五分之三，武训、永智等县不少村庄均超过计划。现全区正组织一切力量抢种。开始群众思想有很多顾虑：有的农民认为遇着歉年黄金也不当吃，要少种棉花花生；有些农民因天旱播种困难，点种则多费人工工具等，使某些村干部、党员降低了信心。经过干部深入耐心动员，这些思想逐渐克服。南宫县委亲将老农点种经验，加以科学提高，推动全县点种。三分区发动党政干部每人与亲朋写两封信，动员点种，收效很大。各级党政机关抽出大批人畜力助种，对群众有极大鼓舞。同时，各级领导上均强调了认真帮助农民解决具体困难。威县鸭窝村根据点种时间的短促与劳力分散的情况，村干、党员以身作则，耐心与群众解说互助的必要与好处，抓住积极分子串连组织起了二十七个点种小组，完成点棉二百八十八亩任务。事后农民说：“这样干就是快！”有些地区组织起了妇女、儿童参加点种，及早完成任务。莘县七区发动了百分之七十以上的妇女参加点种。
    【冀中讯】小满节将届，种棉时日紧迫，无极县检查全县植棉计划完成情况，动员全县干部作最后的突击抢种，争取计划的完成。无极原为产棉区，抗战后由于日寇的分割封锁及掠夺加之销路不畅，棉产量大减。今年根据上级要求与本县情况，计划恢复棉产到全县耕地面积的百分之二十四（抗战前棉田约占全县土地总数半数以上，经敌伪数年摧残，种棉地仅占百分之十左右），具体数字为十三万三千七百三十四亩。经过全县干部群众的努力，已植棉九万六千余亩，占全县耕地面积百分之二十强。其中以六区较好，已超过计划，尚有少数区村未完成任务，现正紧张突击抢种。
    在完成任务较好的区村，主要是做到以下几点：一、县区村干部有坚强的领导，发现问题及时解决。如县委发现四区领导飘浮深入不下去，立即调剂一部力量去加强领导。二、支部党员明确思想，加强带头作用，以模范行动推动群众。三、抓住播种前的三个环节——种籽的准备、检查留棉地、防旱的具体准备。加以具体深入农户检查，保证计划的实现。四、及时召开各种会议检查推动，批评表扬，鼓舞植棉热情。五、以算帐方式和具体宣传打破群众思想顾虑。县委根据任务完成情况，提出全体干部应紧张动员再努一把力突击完成植棉任务，并争取超过计划。要做到水井、水车、辘轳、人畜力五不闲，日夜不停的浇地点种抢种，落后的区村，应向六区看齐。现全县正按县委指示紧张突击，下余四万余亩的任务，预计可超数完成。      （李锋）
