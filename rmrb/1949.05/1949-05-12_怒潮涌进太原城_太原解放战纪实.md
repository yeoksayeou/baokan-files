A Sleepless Night

“Advance bravely and completely annihilate all Kuomintang reactionaries within China who dare to resist.” This was Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu’s order issued on the 21st, and this order pulsated in the hearts of the soldiers: If the enemy does not surrender, resolutely annihilate them. As soon as the order to launch a general offensive on Taiyuan was given, the soldiers were ecstatic. The 22nd and 23rd Regiments of a certain division challenged each other to see who would plant the red flag on the breakthrough point first. Before the assault, there was an incredibly exciting sleepless night. Gunners couldn't sleep, and assault troops couldn't sleep. Qian Fubin, an assault soldier of the 537th Regiment, spent the whole night wiping his Sten submachine gun. The soldiers were as happy as children on New Year's Eve, and they kept getting up and looking up at the sky: "Why isn't it dawn yet?" "The time is almost here."

A Thousand Cannons Fired in Unison

At 5:30 AM on the 24th, after a series of test firings, 1,300 cannons fired in unison from all directions. In an instant, smoke from the shells rose, covering the sky and sun, making the morning sunlight dim and weak, like dusk. One could not see the top of the city wall even from 50 meters away. However, the gunners had already aimed in advance. The howitzer gunners hung ropes on the branches of the large locust trees, set the angles, loaded the shells, and just fired. The shell groups for breaching the city, suppressing fire, and blocking fire started simultaneously, and the shells were fired like machine guns. The soldiers stood up completely, watching the impact points and discussing: This time, the enemy is very obedient in three aspects: the planes in the sky are obedient, and they turn around and run away as soon as our anti-aircraft guns fire; the cannons on the ground are also obedient, and their cannons are silent as soon as ours fire; the enemy themselves are also obedient, and they dare not launch any major counterattacks.

Could We Still Wait?

The original plan was for the artillery bombardment to last three hours, starting at 5:30 AM and for the city to be stormed at 9:00 AM, to reduce the bloodshed for the soldiers. We decided to fire more shells. However, the soldiers repeatedly requested, saying, "The enemy is already mute, can we still wait?" Before 7:30 AM, the brotherly regiments on the north and south sides had already stormed the city. The brotherly regiments on the east side became anxious: a breach had not yet been blown open, and the assault troops climbed up, and when they reached the top, there was a dead enemy soldier lying there with his feet facing them. Liu Yongchang, the first assault soldier to climb the city, grabbed the dead soldier's feet with both hands, supported himself, and climbed up. Then, Han Zhiguo, Qian Fubin, and Gao Laifeng also climbed up. These four heroes who stormed the city greeted the Heilongjiang troops and jointly occupied the Dadongmen (Great East Gate). The enemy was hiding in the tunnels, attacking our breakthrough point from the side, and they were also disarmed, ensuring the safety of the storming troops. Who could still wait? Several powerful army corps had already poured into Taiyuan City from twelve breakthrough points on the east, south, and north sides, like an angry torrent breaking through a dam.

Rushing to the Bell and Drum Tower

The 3rd Platoon of the 4th Company of the 553rd Regiment, alternating with other assault units to provide cover, was the first to rush into Qiaotou Street. A hand-held platoon of the enemy's 83rd Division blocked them again. Zhang Zhicheng, the leader of the 3rd Platoon, shouted: Advance fiercely there. Once inside the city, the troops rushed forward like a raging torrent. The Bell and Drum Tower was the highest point in the entire city. The soldiers shouted "Charge!" and rushed to Liuxiang, to the entrance of the Thirty-fourth Army's high @'s military department. The enemy concentrated thirty or forty machine guns and fired at them. Jin Weilin picked up an American-style light machine gun and shouted while firing: "Charge!" But there were too many enemy machine guns, and they couldn't get through. They charged two or three times without success. A soldier suddenly shouted: "Instructor, our mission is the Bell and Drum Tower! How long are we going to be stuck here?" One sentence reminded the instructor. After learning how to intersperse and cut off the enemy, the soldiers were unwilling to lock horns with the enemy. The political instructor immediately shouted: "Explosives team!" Xue Peizhen immediately ran over. The instructor pointed and said: Blow up those four courtyards and rush through. Xue Peizhen blew up three courtyards in a row and turned pale, almost fainting. Everyone saw that the clothes on his body were soaked with blood, and they knew that he had been wounded in two places as soon as he entered the breakthrough point, but he had never said a word. Two other demolition experts automatically stepped forward to replace him. Rushing to the Hangzhou Restaurant, someone asked: "Is this the Bell and Drum Tower?" The instructor said, "No." When they reached the bottom of a building, someone saw the Bell and Drum Tower, but didn't know for sure if it was it, so they quickly asked: "Instructor, is this the Bell and Drum Tower?" "Yes!" More than a hundred soldiers answered him in unison. The destination that the warriors had been longing for had finally been reached. It was only 8:50 AM, only eighty minutes from the start of the storming of the city. They had already fought three or four battles and run five li. The soldiers climbed up the Bell and Drum Tower and shouted to the enemy: "Don't shoot, whoever shoots will be punished, surrender quickly!" The enemy was panicked, but our artillery was still firing at them because the red flag they carried had been damaged by enemy fire and they couldn't contact the artillery. They quickly tore three red quilts, and Li Duanfu and Duan Gaokui climbed to the top of the building and hung them on the east, west, north, and south sides, and the artillery stopped firing. They captured the enemy's guns.

"Hands Up!"

At 9:15 AM, the 4th Company rushed to Yan Xishan's lair, the "Pacification General Headquarters." The enemy's machine guns roared, resisting fiercely. They threw a round of grenades, and chased the fleeing enemy to Sun Chu's office, but the only ones running in front were a staff member, Xu Yubao, and a soldier, Chen Yongfu. The others had not yet arrived. Chen Yongfu immediately went upstairs and shouted: "Don't move, whoever moves will be shot, leniency to those who surrender their weapons!" He captured the weapons of eighty people by himself. The staff member Xu Yubao chased Wang Jingguo to the basement, and more than two hundred enemies raised their hand-held guns and suddenly stood up. Xu Yubao shouted: "Don't shoot, put down your guns!" Immediately, more than two hundred guns lowered their muzzles. "Put the guns on the table, I guarantee I won't kill you." Immediately, more than two hundred guns were surrendered, and a large pile of pistols were confiscated. Xu Yubao sat on the pile of pistols and ordered them: "Get out!" But they walked and came back again, "Get out!" They walked again and came back again. At this time, Sun Chu and Zhao Shilin came to show their courtesy. They saluted the staff member and offered him cigarettes. However, there were footsteps outside, and our people came. The staff member's courage grew even more, and he sternly ordered them: "Get out quickly!" They still didn't dare to leave. These murderous criminals could only beg now: "We're afraid!" "Clap your hands and come over!" They clapped their hands loudly, but still didn't dare to come out, just shouting: "Comrade Xu, there's gunfire outside." "Take a white towel, raise your hands, and come over." A group of more than a dozen senior officials of Yan Xishan's clique, including Wang Jingguo, immediately did so. They raised their hands high, trembling all over, and didn't dare to lower them until they reached the courtyard.

Taiyuan is Liberated

The liberated soldiers greeted our soldiers and said: Our own people have come. The citizens in the Shuanglong Lane slum said: Our saviors have come! The railway workers shouted during the battle: Long live the People's Liberation Army! and clapped their hands to welcome their own troops. The citizens were busy carrying the wounded, pushing the cannons, and bringing water to the People's Liberation Army. Elementary school students prepared paste for the Liberation Army to post notices of entry into the city. The gunfire had not stopped, but the notice was already crowded with people. Taiyuan City was revived. People crawled out of death and starvation, welcoming their first day of liberation. In the last few minutes of the final resolution of the battle, brotherly units from various departments gathered in front of the Drum Tower in a race-like manner. One side reported the telegram that came last night, shouting while charging: "Nanjing is liberated, Nanjing is liberated!" The other side shouted: "Taiyuan is liberated, Taiyuan is liberated!"

    怒潮涌进太原城
    ——太原解放战纪实
    不眠之夜
    “奋勇前进，全部地歼灭中国境内一切敢于抵抗的国民党反动派。”——这是毛主席朱总司令二十一号的命令，这命令在战士们心坎里跳动起来了：敌人不投降，坚决歼灭它。总攻太原的命令一下，战士们欢欣若狂了，某师二十二团二十三团互相挑战，看谁先把红旗插在突破口上。突击之前，是一个无比兴奋的不眠之夜。炮手们睡不着，突击手们睡不着。五三七团的突击手钱富彬擦了一夜司登式冲锋枪。战士们快活得象除夕之夜的孩子，他们不时的爬起来，仰望着天空：“怎么还不天亮呢？”“时间快到了。”
    千门大炮齐放
    二十四号五点半钟，经过一阵试射，一千三百门大炮，从四面八方齐放。顷刻间，弹烟四起，遮盖天日，使清晨的阳光，暗淡无力，有如黄昏。离城墙五十米也看不见城头了。但，炮手们是事先就瞄准好了的。曲射炮手们在大槐树枝上吊好垂绳，定好角度，装好炮弹，只管放就行，破城射击、制压射击、阻拦射击的炮群同时开始，炮弹已经是象机枪般的连放了。战士们完全立起身子来，看着弹着点议论着：这回打仗，敌人有三老实：天上的飞机老实，我们的高射炮一打，它掉头就跑；地下的大炮也老实，我们的炮一响，他们的炮就哑吧了；敌人自己也老实，再不敢来大反扑。
    这还能等待么？
    原来规定炮击三个钟头，五点半开始，九点钟才开始登城的，为了使战士们少流点血，我们决定了多打些炮弹。但是，战士们再三请求的说：“敌人已经哑吧了，这还能等待么？”七点半钟以前，北面南面的兄弟兵团已经登城了。东面的兄弟兵团着急起来：一个突破口还未爆破开，突击手们，便向上爬了，爬到顶上去刚好敌人的一个死尸躺在那里两只脚正朝着他们，第一名登城突击手刘永昌，双手搬住那死尸的两脚，一撑便爬上去，接着韩治国、钱富彬、高来凤，也爬上去了。他们四个登城英雄迎接合江部队共同占领了大东门，敌人正躲在地洞里侧击我们的突破口，也被他们缴械了，保证了登城部队的安全。谁还能等待呢？几个强大兵团，已从东、南、北面十二个突破口上，如怒潮决堤般的涌进太原城。
    冲到钟鼓楼
    五五三团四连三班，和其他的突击交替掩护着，首先冲进了桥头街，敌人八十三师的一个手提式排又顶住了，三班的张治成带头一喊：那里猛进。进了城，队伍好象激流似的狂奔起来了。钟鼓楼是全城制高点，战士们喊“冲呀！”冲到柳巷，到了三十四军高＠之的军部门口，敌人集中三四十挺机枪，向他们打来，靳维林拿起美式轻机枪一面打一面喊：“冲呀！”但敌人的机枪太多了，冲不过去，连冲两三次都不行，一个战士猛然叫起来：指导员，“我们的任务是钟鼓楼呀！死缠在这里打到什么时候哩？”一句话提醒了指导员，战士们学会插人切断以后，不愿给敌人顶牛角了，政指马上叫：“爆破手！”薛培珍马上跑来，指导员手一指说：爆破那四座院子，突过去。薛培珍一连爆破了三座院子，脸色苍白快昏倒了，大家看着他身上的衣服已被鲜血浸湿了，才知道他进了突破口就负了两处伤，但他自己却始终不愿啃声，另外两个爆破手自动起来接替了他。冲到杭州饭店，有人问：“这是钟鼓楼吗？”指导员说：“不是”，到了楼儿底，有人看到钟鼓楼了，但不知道究竟是不是，忙问：“指导员这就是钟鼓楼？”“是呀！”一百多个战士就齐声回答他。勇士们盼望的目的地，终于达到了。这时候才八点五十分，距登城开始的时间才八十分钟，他们已经打了三四仗，跑了五里地了。战士们爬上钟鼓楼上向敌人高喊：“你们不要打枪，谁打枪惩办谁，赶快缴枪吧！”敌人恐慌了，但是我们的炮还在向这里打，因带的红旗被敌人的炮火打坏，没法和炮兵联络了。他们赶快撕了三床红被子，李端富和段高魁两个人爬到楼顶向东南北三面挂起来，炮才不打了，他们缴了敌人的枪。
    “举起手来！”
    九点十五分，四连冲到阎匪的老巢“绥靖公署”了。敌人的机枪发吼，猛烈的抵抗起来，他们打了一阵手榴弹，跟着逃跑的敌人，就追到孙楚的办公室，但他们跑在最前面的，只有一个工作员徐玉保，一个战士陈勇夫。其他的都未赶到，陈勇夫马上上楼高喊：“不要动，谁动打死谁，缴枪宽待！”一个人便缴了八十个的枪，工作员徐玉保，一个人追到王靖国的地下室了，二百多个敌人端起手提式枪蓦地站起来，徐玉保一喊：“不要打枪，把枪放下来！”马上，二百多支枪口低下来了。“把枪放在桌子上，保证不杀你们。”立刻二百多支枪都缴了，手枪缴了一大堆，徐玉保坐在手枪堆上命令他们：“出！”但他们走走又回来了，“出！”他们二次走走又回来了。这时候孙楚、赵世林来献殷勤了，他们给工作员敬礼，请他吸烟，但是，外面的脚步响，我们的人来了，工作员胆量更大了，厉声命令他们：“快出！”他们仍旧不敢走，这些杀人的罪犯，如今也只得乞求道：“我们害怕呀！”“你们拍手过来！”他们拍着手劈历拍拉的响，仍不敢出来，只是喊：“徐同志，外面打枪呀。“你们拿上白手巾，举起手过来。一群阎匪的十几个高干，连王靖国在内，立刻照办了，他们高举两手，浑身战栗着，一直走到院子里，还迟迟的不敢放下来。
    太原解放了
    被解放的士兵迎着我们的战士说：咱们自家人来了，双龙巷贫民窑里的市民说：咱们救命恩人来了！铁路工会的工人在战斗进行中高喊：人民解放军万岁！拍手欢迎自己的部队，市民们忙着给人民解放军抬伤兵，推大炮，送水喝，小学生打好了浆糊给解放军贴入城布告，枪声未停，布告面前已挤满了人群。太原城复活了，人们从死亡与饥饿中爬出来，迎接他们被解放的第一天。最后解决战斗的前几分钟，各部兄弟兵团，在鼓楼跟前赛跑样的会合了，这边报告昨晚传来的电讯，一面冲锋一面喊：“南京解放了，南京解放了！”那边喊：“太原解放了，太原解放了！”      （本报太原前线电）
