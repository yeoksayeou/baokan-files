The timber merchants Liu Zhenxing and others disregard the law, concealing income and privately levying trade tax; the Ping Tax Fifth Branch Bureau has submitted to the City Tax Bureau for handling

[Reported by this newspaper] When collecting the spring business tax, the Fifth Branch Bureau of the Beiping City Tax Bureau discovered the illegal acts of Liu Zhenxing, manager of Zhenxing Timber Factory, and Dai Qingkun, manager of Chunmao Timber Factory, both under the jurisdiction of the branch bureau in the 14th district, who privately levied trade tax and underreported tax amounts. They were immediately investigated and dealt with. According to the two merchants, when declaring business tax, they falsely claimed that they had no income or profit in January, February, and March, and only started business in April, and refused to declare the amount of business. Although the working group of the branch bureau repeatedly explained the significance of the government's collection of business tax and the obligation of merchants to pay taxes, they still refused to report truthfully. Based on reports from the masses, comrades Ren Zhireng, Liu Zhiming of the branch bureau's working group, and Chang Jinbang of the 14th District Industry and Commerce Section, etc., found in Chunmao Timber Factory that the factory had underreported 500,000 yuan from March 12 to March 31, and 600,000 yuan from April 1 to April 22. The timber factory also underreported 33,000 yuan of trade tax levied at 3% and 55,000 yuan of commission calculated at 5%. Zhenxing Timber Factory underreported 5,093 yuan of trade tax collected in March and 8,044 yuan in April. The Tax Branch Bureau, considering that the two timber merchants arbitrarily deceived the government and disregarded the law, has asked them to issue a guarantee and has submitted a request to the City Tax Bureau for handling.
