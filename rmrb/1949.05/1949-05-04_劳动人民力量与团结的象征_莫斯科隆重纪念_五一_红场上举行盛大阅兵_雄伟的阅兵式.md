Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd: TASS Moscow reports: A parade of the Moscow garrison and a grand demonstration by the working people were held on Red Square on May Day.

The festive decorations of Red Square were simple and solemn. On the buildings opposite the Kremlin wall hung huge red flags, portraits of the great founders of the Soviet state, Lenin and Stalin, and the May Day slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The granite stands were packed with representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, Heroes of Socialist Labor and Heroes of the Soviet Union, ministers, representatives from industry, science and culture, well-known Stakhanovite movement workers, representatives of foreign trade unions, and delegations from various countries invited by the Soviet Union's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to participate in the May Day celebrations. Members of the diplomatic corps and foreign military attachés also attended the parade.

A few minutes before the start of the parade, Marshal Stalin, accompanied by the leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, ascended the Lenin Mausoleum. At this moment, Red Square resounded with a storm of cheers congratulating the great leader of the Soviet people, which lasted for several minutes.

The May Day parade was commanded by Soviet Marshal M.S. Malinin and inspected by the Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Soviet Marshal A.M. Vasilevsky. The Minister of the Armed Forces rode on horseback in front of the troops lined up on Red Square, extending May Day greetings to them. Afterwards, Vasilevsky ascended the Mausoleum and delivered a congratulatory speech to the troops and all the Soviet people. At the end of his speech, Marshal Vasilevsky shouted "Long live the great Bolshevik Party and the beloved leader of the Soviet people, Marshal Stalin!" which elicited a storm of applause from the stands. Thunderous shouts of "Long live!" echoed from the troops. The combined band played the Soviet national anthem, and a salute of guns was fired.

Before the columns marched past the Mausoleum in goose-step, they were applauded by many guests in the stands. The review was led by students from various military academies—the elite of Soviet officers. Among the students of the military academies were many Heroes of the Soviet Union—famous participants in the Great Patriotic War. The ranks of the military academy students were led, as usual, by the Frunze Academy, which has been awarded three orders, followed by the Artillery Academy, the Tank and Mechanized Forces Academy, and the Air Force Academy. Tankers and pilots wore new uniforms to participate in the May Day parade. Students from military schools followed the military academy students, marching proudly forward. At the end were the students of the Suvorov and Nakhimov schools. Following them were the cavalry and motorized infantry. Fast trucks loaded with soldiers of the infantry division rumbled past the Mausoleum. Behind the infantry were anti-aircraft guns, the famous "Katyusha" rocket launchers of the city defense forces, and artillery of various calibers, all towed by powerful Soviet trucks and tractors. The air force review, commanded by Vasily Stalin, Major General of the Air Force, accompanied the review of the ground forces. The last review team of the ground forces was the column of tank troops. The Guards Kantemirovka tank troops, who won glory in the battles for the freedom and independence of the Soviet motherland, drove across Red Square in formations. The powerful and mighty tank troops were followed by Stalin-type tanks—steel fortresses.
