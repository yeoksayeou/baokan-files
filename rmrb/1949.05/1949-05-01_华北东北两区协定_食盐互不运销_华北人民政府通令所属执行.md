    North China and Northeast China Regions Agree:
    No Inter-regional Sales of Salt
    North China People's Government Issues Circular to Subordinates for Implementation
    [This newspaper reports] The North China People's Government, in order to regulate the inter-regional sales of salt between North China and Northeast China, and hoping to cease the shipping of boiled sea salt (芦盐) to the Northeast, issued a circular on April 28th to all levels of government and its subordinate units, stating: "Recently it has been discovered that many merchants in our region are shipping boiled sea salt to the Northeast. However, as the Northeast has a surplus of salt production, it does not require supply from our region. In order to develop the economies of both regions and conserve transportation resources, it has been decided through consultation with the Northeast that the two regions will not engage in inter-regional sales of salt. It is hereby ordered that merchants and people in our region shall, from this date forward, cease shipping boiled sea salt to the Northeast!"

    华北东北两区协定
    食盐互不运销
    华北人民政府通令所属执行
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为规定华北、东北食盐互不运销，希勿再向东北运销芦盐，于四月二十八日通令各级政府及该府各单位称：“近查我区商人多向东北运销芦盐，但以东北盐产过剩，不需我区供给。为发展两区经济，节约运输力量起见，经与东北协商决定：两区食盐，互不运销。仰我区商民人等自即日起，勿再向东北运销芦盐为要！”
