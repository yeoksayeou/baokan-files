　　Demanding Improved Living Conditions
  　Mumbai Sanitation Workers Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th] Mumbai dispatch: Nine thousand sanitation workers in Mumbai have been on strike for five days since the 12th, demanding that the Indian government improve the living conditions of sanitation workers. The Indian government attempted to sabotage the strike movement by buying off a few scoundrels and initiating a partial "return to work," but was met with a powerful response from the striking sanitation workers. As of the 17th, the strike is still ongoing.

　　要求改善生活
  　孟买清道夫罢工
    【新华社北平二十日电】孟买讯：孟买九千名清道夫自十二日起举行了五天的罢工，要求印度政府改善清道夫的生活。印政府曾收买少数败类，企图以局部“复工”来破坏罢工运动，但遇到了罢工清道夫的有力回击，迄十七日为止，罢工仍继续中。
