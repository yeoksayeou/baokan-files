Methods for Sowing Cotton in Spring Drought

    1. Carrying Water for Spot Sowing: Cotton fields near water sources (rivers, wells, etc.) can use a hoe to dig holes about three inches deep. Then, carry water and pour it into the holes. Approximately eight to ten holes can be watered with one kerosene bucket of water. When the soil in the holes is appropriately moist (i.e., the soil crumbles when rubbed between the fingers without being sticky), loosen the soil in the holes with a hoe before sowing. Sow about ten cotton seeds per hole and cover with about 1 1/3 inches of soil. This method requires well-aligned ridges to facilitate cultivation and weeding.

    2. Soil Removal Sowing: When the dry topsoil layer is within four inches, the dry topsoil can be plowed away, and seeds can be sown in the moist soil furrows, similar to ordinary row sowing. Cover with moist soil, then cover with dry soil. When the cotton seedlings extend their roots into the soil and are about to emerge, remove the dry soil.

    Alternatively, the top layer of dry soil can be removed, and holes can be dug in the moist soil for spot sowing. Cover with moist soil, then cover with dry soil, forming a mound. When the cotton seedlings are about to emerge, remove the dry soil.

    3. Deep Furrow Sowing: Use a "haozi" (a type of plow) to create deeper furrows. Sow cotton seeds in the furrows and cover with two inches of soil. When the young roots grow into the soil and the cotton seedlings are about to emerge, remove the excessively thick covering soil. This method should be used when the dry soil layer is not too deep.

    4. Borrowed Soil Sowing: Use a shovel to remove the top layer of dry soil and sow cotton seeds on the moist soil. Then, remove the dry soil from the adjacent row and use the moist soil from the adjacent row to cover the cotton seeds, followed by a layer of dry soil. Before the cotton seedlings emerge, remove the dry soil.

    5. Timely Dry Sowing: For cotton fields too far from water sources and where the farmers lack labor, the cotton seeds can be moistened (moistening facilitates seed dressing and ensures close contact with the soil after sowing). Proceed with timely dry sowing and wait for rain. After rain, if the topsoil becomes compacted, use a rake to break up the surface to facilitate emergence. However, if the rainfall is delayed, this method can result in late cotton seedling development and significantly reduced yields. Avoid trying this unless absolutely necessary.

    6. Morning Sowing: When the soil moisture is barely sufficient, furrow sowing can cause the soil moisture to dissipate due to wind and sun exposure, leading to uneven seedling emergence. In this case, morning furrow sowing can be performed, as the temperature is lower and the humidity is higher in the morning, making it difficult for soil moisture to dissipate. Furthermore, the soil and seeds can absorb sufficient moisture after sowing and covering, which is conducive to germination. However, cotton seeds sown using this method should be soaked in warm water (to promote germination) before sowing. It is even better to sow in the morning when the sprouts have emerged from the seed.

    7. Dug Earth Well Irrigation Spot Sowing: In cotton-growing areas that are not close to water sources but have a high water table, temporary earth wells can be dug for irrigation and spot sowing. Digging each earth well requires three or more labor days, and each well can provide water for planting five to ten mu of cotton.

    The above methods for sowing cotton in spring drought should be selected and applied according to the distance to water sources, the level of the water table, the availability of labor, and the degree of soil dryness in each area.

    春旱播种棉花方法
    一、担水点播法：临近水源的棉田（河、井、附近）可用或镐挖穴，穴深三寸，然后担水灌入穴中，大概每煤油桶水可灌八穴至十穴，俟穴中土壤潮湿适度时（即穴中土壤，用手指搓揉土粒粉碎无黏性时），再用镐将穴土挖松，即行下种，每穴播种棉籽十粒左右，覆土一寸三分上下。这种方法，必须行陇整齐以便中耕除草工作。
    二、揭土播种法：表土干层在四寸以内时，可用犁耕去上层干土，下种于湿土沟内，一如普通条播，覆以湿土，再盖干土于其上，俟棉苗伸根入土，行将出苗时，再揭去干土。
    或将上层干土铲去，在湿土上挖穴点播，覆以湿土，再盖干土于其上，成为丘形，待棉苗快出土时，再将干土揭去。
    三、深沟播种法：用耠子开较深之沟，播棉籽于沟中，覆土二寸，俟幼根生长入土，棉苗将出时，再揭去过厚覆土，用这种方法，须在土地干层不太深时行之。
    四、借土播种法：用铲将上层干土铲去，播棉籽于湿土上，另将行旁干土铲去，取行旁湿土覆于棉籽上，再盖以干土，棉苗出土前，再揭去干土。
    五、适时干播法：离水源太远的棉田，且该农户缺乏劳力，可将棉籽沾湿，（沾湿后便于拌种，且播入土中，易与土壤密合）迳行适时干播等雨，雨后表土板结时，须用耙将表土扒开，以利出苗，惟干播等雨方法，若降雨过迟，常使棉苗发育太晚，产量特少，非万不得已，希勿轻试。
    六、早晨播种法：土壤湿度勉强够用时，若用开沟播种法，经风吹日晒，常使土中水分散失，播种后出苗不齐，在这种情形下，可行早晨开沟播种法，因早晨气温较低，湿气充足，土中水分不易散失，且播种覆土后，土壤与种子即可吸足湿度，有利发芽，惟此法所播棉籽，须在播种前行温水浸种法（催芽），俟幼芽穿谷而出时，即行晨播更为妥当。
    七、掘土井灌水点播法：在不接近水源而地下水位较高棉区，可临时掘土井灌水点播，大概掘每口土井需三工以上，每口土井可供种棉花五亩至十亩之用水。
    以上几种春旱棉花播种方法，须视各地水源远近，地下水位高低，劳动力缺乏与否，及土壤干湿程度，酌情选择应用。
