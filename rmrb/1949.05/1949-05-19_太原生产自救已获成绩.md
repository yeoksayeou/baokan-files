[Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan City Production and Self-Salvation Committee has achieved initial results since liberation. In the early days of liberation, each district established porridge kitchens to provide urgent relief to disaster victims. According to statistics from districts one, two, three, and four, a total of thirty-three porridge kitchens were set up, feeding a total of 39,833 people. Districts that did not set up porridge kitchens instead distributed emergency relief rice and implemented "work-for-relief" programs, organizing unemployed workers and the poor to transport wounded soldiers and bury corpses. The Taiyuan branch of the People's Bank of China also issued small loans to organize disaster victims for production and self-salvation. The committee also contacted the local People's Liberation Army garrison to organize women among the disaster victims to make military uniforms. The threat of hunger and death to the citizens of Taiyuan, caused by the Yan bandit gang, is being eliminated.

　　太原生产自救已获成绩
    【太原电】太原市生产自救委员会，从解放以来工作已获得初步成绩。解放初期，各区即先后设立粥厂，对灾民进行急赈。据一、二、三、四四个区的统计，共设粥厂三十三处，吃粥人数共三万九千八百三十三人。未设粥厂之区，改为发放急赈米，及“以工代赈”，组织失业工人、贫民转运伤俘，掩埋尸体。中国人民银行太原分行并发放小本贷款组织灾民生产自救。该委员会又与当地人民解放军驻军取得联系，组织灾民妇女代做军衣。由阎匪所造成的太原市民的饥饿死亡威胁，正在消除中。
