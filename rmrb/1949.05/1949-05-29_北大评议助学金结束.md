[Ping City News] Peking University's review of "People's Student Aid," which began on the 13th of this month, concluded on the 24th. The discussion sessions of the vast majority of department-level groups focused on the following: First, discussing the difference in nature between People's Student Aid and the public funding during the Kuomintang rule, thereby clarifying the erroneous notion held by some students that People's Student Aid is a "right" to which "everyone" is entitled. Second, students familiar with the lives of workers and peasants described the diligence and hardships of workers and peasants, and compared them with the lives of students, eliminating the preconceived living standards of some students who believed that the minimum living standard for university students must include certain nutritional products and certain enjoyments... Zhang Bikun, a student in the Department of Mathematics, originally intended to apply for Grade A aid to maintain his daily life of two fried cakes and twenty cigarettes. Now, he has voluntarily lowered his application to Grade B. Third, analyzing each student's ideology, style, life, and learning attitude from the second major marker of applying for student aid -- "willingness to serve the people," students spontaneously launched criticism and self-criticism, which improved everyone's ideological understanding. In a very few groups, methods of voting by a show of hands were adopted without first working on ideological clarity; there was also a tendency to consider each other's feelings and initially rate everyone as Grade A, which were appropriately corrected during the department-level review and class review. In this review, Party members and Youth League members played a leading role with their exemplary actions, reducing their application standards to the lowest limit. (Editor's note: It is right for Party members, Youth League members, and activists to be selfless and play an exemplary role, but attention should be paid to avoid causing bias, that is, lowering the grades too much, which may affect study or health. Basically, the assessment should still be based on the specific economic and health conditions of each person.)

　　北大评议助学金结束
    【平市讯】北京大学评议“人民助学金”，自本月十三日开始迄二十四日已全部结束。绝大多数系级小组的讨论会上，都着重进行了如下几个内容：一、讨论人民助学金与国民党统治时期的公费在性质上有何不同，从而澄清了一部分同学在思想上认为人民助学金是“每人”应得权利的错误观念。二、由熟悉工农生活的同学讲述工农的勤辛艰苦，并和同学的生活作比较，扫除了某些同学认为大学生最低限度的生活一定要有那些营养品、那些享受…的预定生活标准，数三张必琨同学本要申请甲种，来维持其每日两个炸糕、二十支纸烟的生活，现在他自动降低为乙种了。三、从申请助学金的第二个大标志--“愿意为人民服务”这一点上来分析每位同学的思想、作风、生活以及学习态度，同学们自动掀起了批评与自我批评，使大家在思想认识上提高了一步。在极少数小组中亦有避免先打通思想而采取举手表决的办法；也有彼此照顾面子，最初都评为甲种的偏向，这些在系级评议和班评议时都作了适当的纠正。在此次评议中，党员、团员都以自己的模范行动起着推动作用，他们把自己申请的标准减低到最低限度上。（编者按：党员团员与积极分子们舍己为公，起模范作用是对的，但应注意勿使产生偏向，即把等级降得太低，以致影响学习或影响健康。基本上仍应根据各人经济、健康具体情况合理评定。）
