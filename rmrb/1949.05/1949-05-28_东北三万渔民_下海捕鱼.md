　　Northeast China, May 27th (Xinhua News Agency) – With the support of the People's Government, over 30,000 fishermen in the three major fishing areas of Northeast China have gone to sea to fish. In the coastal areas of Liaoning and Andong in Liaodong Province, and in the Liaodong Bay fishing area in Liaoxi Province, stretching over 600 li from the Liaohe River estuary to Shanhaiguan, a total of more than 3,200 fishing boats have been mobilized. In the Liaoning and Andong fishing areas alone, as many as 20,000 fishing nets have been deployed. All areas have seen abundant harvests. In the coastal area of Gaiping in the Liaodong fishing area, fishermen caught nearly four million jin of fish in the first ten days of this month. It is estimated that the three major fishing areas will produce over 17.1 million jin of fish this year. These fishing areas suffered severe damage during the Kuomintang rule. Fishermen were unable to bear the heavy taxes and levies and mostly ceased operations. The catch two years ago was not only non-exportable, but it could not even supply the local market needs. The main reason why the vast number of fishermen can go to sea on time this year is the result of the active leadership of the People's Government and its support through grain and loan provisions. According to incomplete statistics, the fishery production loans issued by the former governments of Andong, Liaoning, and Liaoxi provinces alone amounted to 1.424 billion Northeast currency, and the grain loans from Liaoxi Province alone amounted to 500,000 jin.

　　东北三万渔民
  　下海捕鱼
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北沿海三大渔区在人民政府扶助下，已有三万余渔民下海捕鱼。辽东省沿海的辽宁、安东两渔区，及辽西省沿海自辽河口至山海关段长达六百余里的辽东湾渔区，共出动渔船三千二百余只，只辽宁、安东两渔区即出动渔网达两万条。各区收获都很丰富。辽东渔区之盖平沿海渔民本月上旬内即捕鱼近四百万斤。预计三大渔区今年可产鱼一万七千一百余万斤。各该渔区在国民党统治时期曾遭受严重摧残。渔民不堪苛捐杂税盘剥而大部歇业。前年捕鱼量不仅毫无输出，甚至不能供应本地市场需要。今年广大渔民所以能按时下海，主要是人民政府积极领导并贷粮贷款扶助的结果。据不完全统计，原安东、辽宁、辽西三省人民政府发放的渔业生产贷款即达东北币十四亿二千四百万元，贷粮仅辽西省即有五十万斤。
