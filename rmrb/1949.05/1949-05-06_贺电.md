Telegrams of Congratulations

[This newspaper reports] As the All-China Youth Congress opens, various parties have sent telegrams of congratulations:

(I) Telegram of Congratulations from the Youth League

To the Presidium of the First All-China Youth Congress and all Youth Representatives:

On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, in Beiping, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, youth representatives from all ethnic groups, all democratic parties, all regions, all professions, and all religious beliefs gather together to convene the First All-China Youth Congress. This is an unprecedented grand event in the Chinese youth movement. We extend our infinite joy and the warmest fraternal greetings to this democratic and united congress of Chinese youth!

Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth have played a great role in the great revolutionary movement to strive for the independence and freedom of their motherland. Now, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, directly supported by American imperialism, has collapsed, and the era of building a democratic and prosperous New China is about to begin. In the future, the main tasks of our Chinese youth, in addition to resolutely carrying the revolution through to the end and striving to completely eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the shortest possible time, must actively participate in the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, as well as cultural and educational undertakings. We must study Mao Zedong Thought, study various scientific and technological knowledge, and closely integrate learning with production and combat. All members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League will first unite with all Chinese youth to complete the above tasks and build a New Democratic China together. We wish the congress a victorious success.

Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, May 4th

To the National Youth Congress: The Congress will unite and mobilize millions of young people to become a vital force in creating a New China. Special telegram of congratulations.

(III) Telegram of Congratulations from the North China Federation of Trade Unions

The telegram of congratulations from the First Congress of North China Workers states in brief: Chinese youth and workers have always stood together in the arduous struggle of several decades to oppose our common enemy. In the future, we workers will unite more closely with you and exert even greater strength.

First Congress of North China Workers, May 5th.

Mr. Li Jishen, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in his telegram of congratulations to the congress: "The arduous task facing us in the future will be the New Democratic construction cause of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country. The completion of this historical mission still requires our further efforts. I am deeply convinced that you will be able to fulfill this revolutionary task satisfactorily with the heroic fighting spirit you have shown in the national liberation war."

The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party called on young people to adhere to unity and progress, support the Chinese Communist Party, carry the revolution through to the end, and strengthen their studies in order to build a democratic and prosperous People's Democratic Republic of China and unite with the world's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union to jointly defend world peace and oppose imperialist aggression wars.

The China Zhi Gong Party said in its telegram of congratulations: It hopes that Chinese youth can establish unified organizational structures to lead Chinese mainland youth and overseas Chinese youth to bravely advance in the great work of building a New China.
