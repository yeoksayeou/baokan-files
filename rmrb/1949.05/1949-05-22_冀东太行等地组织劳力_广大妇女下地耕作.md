　　Mobilizing Labor in Eastern Hebei and Taihang Areas
  　Broad Masses of Women Go to the Fields to Farm
    [Report from this newspaper] In Leting, Eastern Hebei; Wen'an, Central Hebei; Pingshun and Ci County, Taihang Area; Laishui and Liangxiang, Chahar, and other places, broad masses of women have been mobilized to participate in agricultural production, achieving remarkable results in sowing, planting, repairing canals, watering wheat, and weeding wheat. According to incomplete statistics from Leting County, more than 36,000 women participated in spring plowing and sowing; at the same time, women from the families of martyrs, military personnel, and cadres actively joined the sowing campaign. In Wen'an, women became almost the main force of production in the campaign to sink wells and plant crops. According to incomplete statistics from 28 villages in the second and fourth districts, 1,053 women participated in this campaign. In Laishui’s first district, 55 women from Zhao Gezhuang participated in a ditch-digging competition and dug 690 zhang in five days. In Shenjiao Village, Sixth District, Huguan, Taihang, more than 30 small mutual aid teams of women were organized, and they hoed more than 1,000 mu of land in five days. In the beginning, many difficulties were encountered in mobilizing women to participate in production in various places. First of all, women underestimated labor and had thoughts of relying on men. For example, when mobilizing women to push water carts in Shacheng Village, Huailai, some women said, "How can we women do this!" Some women in Pingshun said, "What does it mean to improve women's status if we are asked to carry manure to the fields!" Secondly, men underestimated women's production. For example, some farmers in Pingshun said, "Women can't do a good job in the fields; instead, they harden the land." Some lacked confidence and said, "Many women have bound feet, and the young ones have children; it is impossible to mobilize the old women." Therefore, it is first necessary to correct the feudal remnants in the thinking of the cadres. At the beginning, Lin County reviewed the cadres' views on women's work at a cadre meeting, and then used examples to persuade everyone to pay attention to women's production. At the production expansion cadre meeting in Pingshun, after recalling the situation in 1943 when men went out to fight locusts and women were fully responsible for field production, it promoted the whole county cadres' attention to women's production, and the women's production enthusiasm was also improved. The masses then proposed, "Men patiently teach, and women learn modestly, strive for 'an inch of growth in production'!" Taihang and other places put forward the slogan of "harmonious families, and striving for production." Based on this principle, Fuyang Village, Ci County, held a small wife symposium to talk about the pain of being abused and oppressed in the old society and the benefits of family harmony, and also studied methods of family harmony. Everyone was in high spirits. At the same time, a symposium for young women was held to discuss how women can be valued. They said, "Do a good job in production!" A young woman stood up and said, "That's not all, you still have to discuss things at home with your mother-in-law and husband." Some scrambled to say, "We understand the principles of the meeting. We will also tell our families when we go back. If everyone progresses, they will be harmonious, and then we can do a good job in production, and our status will also be improved." ... In this way, women's enthusiasm for participating in labor was encouraged, and the village's mutual aid production was well done. However, appropriate care must be taken for women's participation in labor, and do not allow excessive labor to damage their health, otherwise it will cause public dissatisfaction.

　　冀东太行等地组织劳力
  　广大妇女下地耕作
    【本报讯】冀东乐亭、冀中文安、太行平顺、磁县，察哈尔涞水、良乡等地，发动广大妇女参加农业生产，在点种、播种、修渠、浇麦、锄麦上，获得显著成绩。乐亭全县据不完全统计：有三万六千余名妇女参加春耕播种；同时烈、军、干属的妇女大批卷入播种热潮。文安在突击打井点种的运动里，妇女几乎成了生产的生力军，据二、四区二十八个村的不完全统计，有一千零五十三名妇女投入这一运动。涞水一区赵各庄五十五个妇女参加挖渠竞赛，五天挖了六百九十丈。太行壶关六区神郊村，组织的妇女小型互助组达三十余个，她们五天内下地打圪垃一千余亩。各地发动妇女参加生产开始都遇了很多困难。首先是妇女们对劳动轻视，有依靠男人的思想。如怀来沙城村在发动妇女推水车时，有的妇女说：“我们妇女那能干这个！”平顺有的妇女说：“提高妇女么，怎叫上地担大粪哩！？”其次是男人们对妇女生产轻视，如平顺有的农民说：“妇女们到地干不好活，反倒把地踩硬啦。”有的信心不足，说：“妇女们小脚多，年青的又有孩子，婆婆妈妈的发动不起来。”因此，首先必须纠正干部的封建思想残余。林县开始即在干部会议上检查了干部对妇女工作的观点，对群众则以实例算帐说服大家对妇女生产的重视。平顺在生产扩大干部会上，回想一九四三年男人出发打蝗虫，妇女完全负起了田间生产的情况后，促使了全县干部对妇女生产的重视，妇女们的生产情绪也因之提高，群众就提出：“男人耐心教，妇女虚心学，争取‘生产长一寸’！”太行等地则提出“和睦家庭，努力生产”的口号，磁县滏阳村根据这原则乃召开了小型的老婆座谈会，大家谈出在旧社会中被虐待受压迫的痛苦和家庭和睦的好处，还研究了和睦家庭的方法，大家情绪都很高。同时又召开了青年妇女座谈会，讨论妇女怎样才能被重视时，她们说：“好好生产呗！”有一个青年妇女站起来说：“这还不沾，家里有事还得好好找婆子丈夫商量。”有的抢着说：“咱开会懂的道理。回去也给家里说，大家都进步了就会和睦，这才能搞好生产，咱们地位也就会提高。”……这一来妇女参加劳动的情绪被鼓动起来，该村的互助生产弄得很好。但对妇女参加劳动也必得有适当的照顾，勿使因过分劳累而损害健康，否则也会引起群众不满。
