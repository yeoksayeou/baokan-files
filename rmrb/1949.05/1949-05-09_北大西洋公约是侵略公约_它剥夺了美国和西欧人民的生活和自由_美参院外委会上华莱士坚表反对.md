Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: According to a TASS dispatch from Washington: Wallace testified on the 5th on behalf of the Progressive Party at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denouncing the North Atlantic Treaty. Wallace declared: The North Atlantic Treaty will impose an unbearable burden on the American people, causing a reduction in living standards and a loss of basic freedoms. This treaty undermines the possibility of European revival. It is a tool for interfering in the internal affairs of European countries and will turn all Western European countries into Greece. It imposes an unbearable burden of armaments on these countries, which will cause these countries to cut funding for social welfare programs and the living standards of the people. This treaty is a military alliance for the purpose of aggression. It provocatively establishes military bases around the Soviet Union. The treaty pushes American army and air force bases to the borders of the Soviet Union, establishes general staff headquarters on the European continent, arms Western Europe and puts it in a state of war.

Wallace also said that the North Atlantic Treaty transcends the United Nations and blatantly violates the United Nations Charter. When Acheson claimed that the North Atlantic Treaty was a tool to strengthen the United Nations, he deceived the American people. Ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty will shatter the American people's hopes for a peace with freedom and justice, and abandon the peace that was won at such a great cost.

Wallace pointed out: It is wrong to think that armament programs will resolve the American economic crisis. Current industrial production has already decreased by seven percent. Farmers' incomes have decreased by two billion yuan annually, and the fluctuations of small businesses are growing to an alarming scale. The total wages of factory workers have decreased by four billion yuan annually, and unemployment and partial employment are becoming major problems.

Wallace also rebuked: The US government's fraternization with the butcher Franco and the restoration of West Germany's war potential marks a new and shocking moral decline. In conclusion, Wallace outlined his plan for a peaceful resolution of international problems.

Note: The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee began the so-called testimony procedure on April 27 before debating the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty. In addition to Wallace, those who have testified to the committee are all senior officials of the US federal government, who are the political representatives of Wall Street monopoly capital, and naturally all advocate the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty.

    北大西洋公约是侵略公约
    它剥夺了美国和西欧人民的生活和自由
    美参院外委会上华莱士坚表反对
    【新华社北平八日电】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：华莱士于五日代表进步党在参院外委会听取意见的会议上作证，痛斥北大西洋公约。华莱士宣称：北大西洋公约将在美国人民身上加上无法忍受的重担，造成生活标准的降低和基本自由的丧失。这个公约破坏了欧洲复兴的可能。它是干涉欧洲国家内政的工具，会使所有西欧国家都变成希腊。它加于这些国家以无法忍受的军备的重担，会引起这些国家削减社会福利计划的经费和人民的生活水准。这个公约是以侵略为目的的军事联盟。它挑衅地在苏联的周围建立军事基地。公约把美国的陆军与空军基地推到苏联的边疆上，在欧洲大陆建立参谋总部，武装西欧并使它处在战时状态下。
    华莱士又说，北大西洋公约超越联合国，露骨地违反联合国宪章。当艾奇逊自称北大西洋公约是用以加强联合国的工具的时候，他欺骗了美国人民。批准北大西洋公约，就要使美国人民对自由与正义的和平所怀抱的希望破灭，并且背弃了曾经用那样重大的代价所赢得的和平。
    华莱士指出：以为军备计划会解除美国的经济危机是错误的。现在的工业生产已经减少了百分之七。农民的收入每年减少了二十亿元，小企业的波动日益增长到令人恐慌的规模。制造厂工人的工资总额，每年减少了四十亿元，失业和部分就业正成为主要的问题。
    华莱士又斥责：美国政府与屠夫佛朗哥结交和恢复西德的战争潜力的行为，是标志着新的惊人的道德的坠落。华莱士在结语中概述了他的和平解决国际问题的计划。
    按：美国参院外委会在辩论批准北大西洋公约以前，于四月二十七日开始了所谓作证的程序。已经向该委会举证的除华莱士外，都是美国联邦政府的高级官员，他们是华尔街垄断资本的政治代表，自然都主张批准北大西洋公约。
