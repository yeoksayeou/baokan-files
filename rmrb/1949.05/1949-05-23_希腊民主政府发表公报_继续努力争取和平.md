　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st: Free Greece Radio broadcasts: The ministers of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government held a meeting on the 18th in a certain place in Free Greece to discuss Prime Minister Passalidis' report on efforts to achieve peace and Army Minister Vlantas' report on the current military situation. After the meeting, the Provisional Democratic Government issued a communiqué announcing that it would unswervingly continue its efforts for peace in Greece. The communiqué said: The Provisional Democratic Government's initiative to strive for peace in Greece has given a new impression to the Royalist-fascist soldiers, the National Guard, and honest officials, to the entire Greek people, and to world democratic public opinion. The communiqué also called on world democratic public opinion to stop the insane massacre currently being carried out by the Greek Royalist-fascists. The communiqué said: The Royalist-fascists and foreign imperialists are attempting to extinguish the people's uprising in support of peace by massacring the heroes of the first resistance movement. Many soldiers who participated in the first resistance movement in prisons throughout the Royalist-fascist controlled areas have been sentenced to death, and they are currently on a hunger strike demanding a halt to the executions. At the same time, this terror continues everywhere, especially in western Macedonia, where more than 10,000 relatives of democratic army fighters have been forcibly removed from their homes.
