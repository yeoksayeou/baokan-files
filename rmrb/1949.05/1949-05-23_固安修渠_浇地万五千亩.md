　　Gu'an Repairs Canal
  　Irrigating 15,000 Mu of Land
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In order to cooperate with the anti-drought and rush planting work, the Yongding River Spring Works Command proposed that the Jinmen Sluice Gate release water to irrigate the plains in the northwest of Gu'an. With the consent of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, ten technicians were dispatched to assist in the work. Construction began on the 7th and was completed by the 10th, including a 24-kilometer main canal (6 meters wide at the bottom) and four branch canals. A trial water release was conducted on the evening of the 10th, and the official water release began on the 13th. The current water volume is three cubic meters per second, irrigating more than ten villages including Ziying in the eighth district of Gu'an, totaling more than 15,000 mu of land. The terrain in this area is flat and slopes slightly to the southwest, providing naturally favorable conditions for developing water conservancy, with approximately 600,000 mu of land available for irrigation. Currently, an engineering office is being planned to conduct surveying and design for large-scale irrigation projects, with construction preparations underway for after the autumn harvest. 　　　　　　　(Da San)

  　浇地万五千亩
    【本报讯】永定河春工指挥部为配合防旱突击播种工作，提议由金门闸放水灌溉固安西北一带平原。经华北水利委员会同意，并派技术人员十人前往协助工作。七日开工，至十日则完成干渠（底宽六公尺）二十四公里及支渠四道。十日晚试行放水一次，十三日正式放水。现有水量三个秒立方公尺，正灌溉固安八区之子营等十余村，计能浇地一万五千余亩。该地区地形平坦，略向西南倾斜，具备开发水利天然有利条件，约有六十万亩可资灌溉。现为进行大规模灌溉工程，正拟成立工程处，进行测量设计，准备秋后开工。　　　　　　　（达三）
