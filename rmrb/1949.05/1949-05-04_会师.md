It is extremely appropriate to designate "May Fourth" as "Youth Day." It was a day of great awakening of the political consciousness of young people, and also a day when they used their blood and flesh as the price to create a glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism for the later youth movement. However, in the KMT-controlled areas, the reactionary government dared not admit it. They forcibly pulled "Youth Day" to March 29th. Because they feared this revolutionary day, they themselves were precisely the object of the revolution—the feudal bureaucratic group under the wings of imperialism. Later, "Literary Day" was also designated on "May Fourth." I remember Mr. Guo Moruo said at the "Literary Day" conference in Chongqing: "We come to take over the position of 'Youth Day' to make our literature forever young." In fact, even though "Youth Day" was not "approved" by the reactionary government, the young people could not forget their day. Every year on this day, they always held meetings to commemorate it. If the situation did not allow, there would at least be an evening party: inviting people to give speeches, reciting poems, performing plays, singing, and having games. The people invited, the poems recited, the plays performed, and the songs sung were all opposed, disgusted, and headache-inducing to the reactionary government. Such a meeting itself was both a commemoration and a resistance. I remember last year on "May Fourth," at the evening party of "Tongji University" and "Drama School" in Shanghai… a skit written by the students themselves was performed, called "The World Is For All." One person dressed as Chiang Kai-shek, and recited the "Political Consultative Conference" agreement with a mouthful of "ara, ara." Later, it was reported by special agents, and almost caused a major disaster.

This year, commemorating the 30th anniversary of "May Fourth" in the birthplace of "May Fourth" is truly joyful and historically significant. The fire at Zhao Jia Lou ignited revolutionary enthusiasm, illuminated the revolutionary path. The spirit of struggle and unyieldingness for the past 30 years is truly like a fire. It has tempered countless warriors, and also burned many who could not withstand the fire into ashes.

Peiping—this "imperial capital," the stronghold of feudal forces, has been reborn because of liberation. Chairman Mao's portrait hangs high on the city gate, and it is already the city of the people. Shortly before commemorating this great day, a million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River, and a large area of land, one famous city after another, were all liberated—especially Nanjing, the lair of the reactionary group, had to be abandoned in a hurry, and scattered like birds and beasts. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution of the past 30 years is about to victoriously complete its mission. No matter how the British and American imperialists clamor and attempt to interfere with the revolutionary forces in China, if they do not know how to retreat in the face of difficulty, they will have to eat the bitter fruit themselves. Today, the strength of the Chinese people is so majestic that it can strike at all imperialist acts of aggression, becoming a powerful pillar in the world's peace front. Anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, the slogans put forward in "May Fourth" of that year, after nearly 30 years of revolutionary struggle led by the Communist Party, are about to be fully realized.

We warmly commemorate this day because it is in such a situation. "May Fourth," welcome, ah, you have come at the right time! "May Fourth," welcome, ah, it is precisely "winds and rains from all directions converging on Peiping"! Democratic figures, cultural figures, writers, and artists from all parties have gathered from all directions, and among them are the predecessors of "May Fourth" of that year. Young people, those who were originally in the dark areas, and those who have newly brought from the light, have converged—under the banner of Mao Zedong, under the call of the fighting "May Fourth," they have converged.

On this great festival, we should make a final reckoning of the past battles, see how much we have gained; and the most important thing is to review our own ranks, and move forward towards the "May Fourth" spirit, which has been enriched and enhanced by the revolutionary situation. A team, now is even more expanded. The "youth movement" of today's significance has broken through the circle of intellectuals. It has rushed into the countryside, and rural youth have joined in; it has rushed into factories, rushed into the troops, countless workers and soldiers have joined in, the longer its team, the stronger its strength and lineup.

At present, the great revolutionary tide has rushed many educated youths out of schools. The streets are full of college students, middle school students, male and female, walking happily, with a white symbol pinned on their plain clothes. The enthusiasm, excitement, and courage of their emotions and moods, I can confirm with the feeling of "1927" individuals running to Wuhan to join the army. Of course, the times are different, and the latecomers must be better.

It is a good phenomenon that tens of thousands of young people have joined the revolutionary ranks. This shows that they are going to move with the times. I think that it is of great significance that whether young students who have left school or stayed in school can gather with young cadres from the old liberated areas. Even if they are both intellectuals, because of the different training they have received, there will be a difference between strength and weakness. Those who have struggled in the liberated areas have mostly been tempered into steel for a long time, while those who were originally under the reactionary regime, although they are also strong, I am afraid that most of them are still a piece of iron. Some of the signs of intellectuals on their bodies will be revealed in comparison. For example, during the anti-Japanese movement, it was able to be vigorous, because it was revolutionary and romantic at the same time; today, you need to go to the countryside, go to the factory, work practically and silently like ants, you may feel rigid and dry.

Everyone has heard the colorful speeches of "combat heroes," "women representatives," and "farmer representatives." He (she) is not very literate, but listening to his (her) words is better than reading books for ten years. Comparing these young people with the educated youths in schools, the difference is even greater. I think that he (she)—intellectual cadres from the liberated areas and farmers, workers, soldiers, and women—should be used as a mirror to look at themselves, and remove the exposed shortcomings with the determination to remove blemishes on the face. Only when the old dies can the new grow.

Commemorating "May Fourth," this glorious day, we must use a brand new self to realize the responsibility that this great tradition adds to our shoulders, to add a glory to ourselves and to this day.

    把“五四”定为“青年节”是极为恰当的，这是青年们政治意识大觉醒的一天，也是以血肉作代价，给后来的青年运动开创了反帝反封建的一个光荣传统的一天。但是在蒋管区里，反动政府却是不敢承认它。硬把“青年节”拉到三月二十九去。因为他怕这个革命的日子，他们本身恰好就是革命的对象—在帝国主义卵翼之下的封建官僚集团。后来“文艺节”也规定在“五四”，记得郭沫若先生在重庆的“文艺节”大会上说过：“我们来接‘青年节’的阵地，使我们的文艺永远年青”。其实，虽是“青年节”没有被反动政府“批准”，而青年们却忘不了自己的这个日子。每到这一天，总是开会纪念，情势再不允许，至少也有个晚会：请人讲演，朗诵诗，演剧，歌咏，游艺一番。所请的人，所朗诵的诗，所演的戏，所唱的歌，全是反动政府所反对，所讨厌，所头痛的。这样的会本身就既是纪念，又是反抗。记得去年“五四”上海“同济大学”，“戏剧学校”………的晚会上，演了一出同学们自己编的活报，剧名叫做“天下为此公”，一个人扮成蒋介石的样子，满口阿拉阿拉的念“政协”的协定。后来被特务报告上去，几乎出了大乱子。
    今年在“五四”的策源地来纪念“五四”的三十周年，真是叫人高兴，也太富于历史意义了。赵家楼的一把火，燃烧起革命的热情，照亮了革命的道路，三十年来的斗争，不屈不挠的精神，真是象一把火。它锻炼出来无数的战士，也把多少经受不住火炼的烧化成了灰烬。
    北平——这个“帝王之都”，封建势力的大本营，因为解放而新生了。城头上高悬着毛主席的画像，它已经是人民自己的城了。就在纪念这个伟大日子的不久之前，百万大军渡过了长江，一大片土地，一个个名城，全被解放了——特别是南京，反动集团的巢穴，也不得不仓皇舍弃，作鸟兽散了。三十年来反帝反封建的革命，快要胜利的完成它的任务，英美帝国主义任它怎样叫嚣，怎样企图干涉中国的革命力量，结果如不知难而退，就得自食苦果。今日中国人民的力量雄伟得可以打击一切帝国主义者的侵略行为，成为全世界和平阵线里有力的一根支柱。反帝反封建，“五四”当年所提出来的口号，经过了将近三十年共产党所领导的革命斗争，已经快要完全实现了。
    我们热烈的纪念这个日子，就是因为它是在这样一个形势之下。“五四”，欢迎呵，你来得真是时候！“五四”，欢迎呵，正是“八面风雨会北平”！各党派的民主人士、文化人、作家、艺术家、从各方面汇聚了来，这里边就有“五四”当年的前辈。青年们，原处在黑暗区域的，和新从光明地带来的会师了——在毛泽东的旗帜之下，在战斗的“五四”的号召之下，会师了。
    在这个伟大的节日里，我们应该对过去的战斗结一笔总帐，看看我们收获了多少；而最重要的还是检阅一下自己的队伍，向着被革命的形势所充实，所提高了的“五四”精神前进。一个队伍，现在是更加扩大了。今天意义的“青年运动”，已经冲破了知识分子的圈子。它冲进了农村，农村青年加入进来了；他冲进了工厂，冲进了部队，无数的工人，战士，加入进来了，它的队伍越长，它的力量和阵容也就越壮大了。
    目下革命的大浪潮把许多的知识青年从学校里冲了出来。满街都是大学生，中学生，男的，女的，高高兴兴的走着，便衣上别着一个白符号，他（她）们热情，兴奋，勇敢的那种情绪与心境，我可以用“一九二七”个人跑到武汉去从军那个感觉印证出来。当然，时代不同了，后来者一定是居上的。
    这成千上万的青年参加到革命的队伍里来，是一个好现象，这表示：他（她）们要随着时代动起来了。我觉得，无论走出学校的，或留在学校的青年同学，能够同来自老解放区的青年干部会聚，是意义重大的。即便同样是知识分子，因为所受到锻炼不同，也就显出强弱来了。在解放区斗争过来的，大部已久炼成钢，而原在反动政权之下的，虽然也是强硬，但大多数恐怕仍然是块铁。身上带着的一些知识分子的标志，会在比照之下显现出来。譬如说吧，反抗运动时代，能够轰轰烈烈，因为那是革命的，同时又是浪漫的；今天需要你进农村，下工厂，切切实实，不声不响蚂蚁般的工作了，你也许会觉得死板了、干燥了。
    大家都听过“战斗英雄”、“妇女代表”、“农民代表”们的有声有色的演讲，他（她）不大识字，但是听他（她）一席话胜读十年书。把这些年青人和学校里的知识青年一比，差得更远了。我觉得，应当把他（她）——从解放区来的知识分子干部和农、工、兵、妇女——当做一面镜子，照一照自己，把露出的缺点，象点去脸上的斑痣一般下决心除掉它，在旧的死去的地方，新的才能够生长出来。
    纪念“五四”，这个光荣的日子，我们必须用一个崭新的自我实现这个伟大的传所统加在我们肩头上的责任，去给自己，给这个日子增加上一份光荣去。
