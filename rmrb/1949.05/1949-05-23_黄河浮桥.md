　　Yellow River Pontoon Bridge
　　"Ten years east of the river, ten years west of the river," this is the conclusion drawn by the folks on both sides of the Yellow River about the ever-changing Yellow River. The Yellow River's water flow is not fixed; the muddy yellow water, with its rolling waves, is known as a "natural barrier." In mid-March, after the Yellow River Headquarters received the order for the Fourth Field Army to cross the river southward, it quickly conveyed it to every sailor, and everyone immediately became tense. The Fourth Brigade of the water soldiers was stationed in Sunkou, Shou Zhang. The Yellow River Headquarters designated this place as a crossing point. If ferries were used, thirty-three docks would need to be built, requiring 1.8 million catties of straw and 7,000 laborers. This would be costly and affect farmers' spring planting; at the same time, the Yellow River's water flow is not fixed. The docks might also be washed away, which might prolong the crossing time. Wu Lanting, the chief of the boat management section, thought to himself: The best way to get the troops across the river quickly and save manpower is to build a bridge on the river. But he not only had no experience in this regard, but had never even heard of building a pontoon bridge over the Yellow River. However, he remembered that "labor can create the world," as stated in "A Brief History of Social Development," and that as long as you work hard to find a solution, it can be done. With this in mind, he immediately ran to discuss it with the sailors of the Fourth Brigade. An old sailor said: "I've lived on the river for over sixty years! I've never heard of building a pontoon bridge over the Yellow River that can carry cars and tanks." The rest of the sailors also shook their heads. Zhu Pinwen, the director of the political department of the Yellow River Headquarters, was a veteran comrade who had participated in the Long March and crossed the iron chain bridge over the Jinsha River! Comrade Wu Lanting put forward his plan to build a bridge and discussed it with him, and immediately got his approval. After the two discussed it, they believed that the key to completing this plan was to rely on the sailors to come up with ideas. Therefore, Director Zhu took charge and convened the cadres and sailors of the Fourth Brigade to mobilize them, explaining the great significance of this urgent crossing mission and calling on everyone to make great contributions for the people. The sailors immediately responded to the call, and at the team meetings, everyone spoke enthusiastically, proposing many solutions such as finding iron chains and large boats... Comrade Wu Lanting, based on the opinions put forward by everyone, drafted a plan himself. The plan was to place the large boats in the water, drop large anchors, plant wooden stakes in the water on the south bank since there were no trees, tie the boats to the wooden stakes and trees with thick ropes, and then lay a layer of wooden planks on the boats. After the plan was made, everyone thought it would work. The next day, they started working. In the past few days, it had been raining continuously, and the carts could not transport materials. The soldiers took off their shoes and socks and worked through the muddy water. After many twists and turns, the pontoon bridge was finally initially erected with everyone's efforts. However, when many people stepped on one boat, the boat sank, making the pontoon bridge into a "concave" shape. How could it allow tens of thousands of catties of heavy vehicles to pass? Everyone was scratching their heads again. Comrade Wu Lanting began to study hard again. Suddenly, he thought that if the mast on the boat was laid down and pressed against the bow of the upstream boat, and then tied to the wooden piers on both ends of the boat with ropes, creating a force-equalizing effect, so that dozens of boats become one boat, and no one can rise and fall, wouldn't that work? He told everyone his idea, and then everyone became busy again. "Heave-ho! Heave-ho!" The happy and excited labor songs spread far and wide along the flowing water. For the first time in history, a stable, street-like pontoon bridge appeared on the roaring and turbulent Yellow River. At the head of the pontoon bridge, a pine branch arch was erected, with large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu hung on the top, with the four characters "Yellow River Pontoon Bridge" written on it. The horizontal scroll and couplets read, "Welcome the Fourth Field Army to the South, Liberate all of China." At both ends of the pontoon bridge, crowds of people welcoming and seeing off gathered all day long. A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army set up an encouragement shed and a military band, and the sailors also spontaneously organized a local opera. From April 24th to May 9th, tanks, cars, artillery vehicles, carts, cavalry, infantry... of the People's Liberation Army continuously crossed the Yellow River pontoon bridge. The soldiers who crossed the river on the pontoon bridge praised the great creation of the Yellow River sailors in unison.

　　黄河浮桥
    “十年河东，十年河西”，这是黄河两岸的老乡们给变化无常的黄河所下的定论。黄河水流不固定，混浊的黄水，波浪滚滚，号称“天险”。三月中旬，黄河指挥部接到南渡第四野战军南渡任务后，很快传达给每个水手，大家马上紧张起来。寿张孙口住着水兵第四大队，黄河指挥部选定这种作为一个渡口，如果用船摆渡，需要修筑三十三个码头，需用秸料一千八百万斤，和七千个民工。这样，耗费大并影响农民春耕播种；同时黄河水流不固定。码头还可能被冲刷掉，怕要延长渡河时间。船管股长武兰亭同志心里想：要想使部队很快的过去河，又能节省民力，最好的是能在河上架一座桥。但自己不但没有这个经验，而且根本未听说过黄河上能架浮桥这回事。总之，又想起在“社会发展简史”上边说“劳动可以创造世界”，只要努力想办法总会办到的。想到这里，他马上跑去和四大队水手们商量，一个老水手说：“我在河上活了六十多岁啦！从没有听说过黄河上能架浮桥过汽车、坦克”。其余的水手们也都摇头。黄河指挥部政治部主任朱品文同志是长征过来的老同志，他曾在长征时渡过金沙江的铁锁桥！武兰亭同志把自己的架桥计划提出来和他研究，当即得到他的同意，二人研究了一下，认为：想完成这一计划，要紧的还是靠水手们大家想办法。于是，由朱主任负责，召集第四大队的干部和水手们进行动员，说明这次赶渡任务的伟大意义，号召大家为人民立大功。水手们马上响应号召，在班务会议上，大家争先恐后的发言，提出找铁链子，找大船……等很多办法。武兰亭同志根据大家所提的意见，自己拟划了一个图案，计划将大船放在水中、抛下大锚，南岸没有树，在水里栽下木桩，用大粗绳把船拴在木桩和树上，船上再铺上一层木板。计划好后，大家都认为能行。第二天即动手，这几日来，偏偏连日阴雨，大车不能运材料，水兵同志都脱掉鞋袜，踏着泥水的干，经过不少波折，在大家努力下浮桥终于初步架起来了。但是，当很多人踏上一只船时，这只船就往下沉，使浮桥成了“凹”字形，这怎样能使几万斤的重汽车通过呢？大家又有些搔头。武兰亭同志又苦心钻研起来，猛然间，他想如果把船上的桅放倒，压在靠上流的船头上，再用绳拴在船两头的木墩上，起一种均力作用，使数十只船成为一只船，谁也不能上下起伏，那不就成了吗？他把自己的主张告诉了大家，于是，都又忙碌起来，“嘿呀！嘿呀！”愉快兴奋的劳动歌声，顺着流水传得老远老远。奔腾叫啸波浪滚滚的黄河上，有史以来第一次出现了这样平稳犹如街道的大浮桥。浮桥头，竖起了一座松枝彩坊，最上面挂毛主席朱总司令的大画像，上面写着“黄河浮桥”四个大字，横联与对联上写着“欢迎第四野战军南下，解放全中国。”浮桥两端，整日集中着欢迎欢送的人群。第四野战军某部设着鼓励棚、军乐队，水手们也自动组织了一台本地戏，从四月二十四日开始，直至五月九日，人民解放军的坦克、汽车、炮车、大车、骑兵、步兵……源源跨过黄河浮桥。踏着浮桥过河的战士们，同声赞扬着黄河水兵们的这件大创造。
