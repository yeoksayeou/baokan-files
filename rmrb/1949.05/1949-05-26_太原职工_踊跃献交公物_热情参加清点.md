    Taiyuan Workers
    Enthusiastically Hand Over Public Property
    Eagerly Participate in Inventory
    [Taiyuan Electric] In Taiyuan, mobilizing workers to hand over public property and participate in inventory has become a mass movement. Preliminary statistics from units such as the Northwest Manufacturing Factory, Jinxing Machinery Factory, Northwest Kiln Factory, Coal Mine First Factory, Yucai Factory, Chengwai Flour Mill, Northwest Steel Plant, Northwest Printing Factory, and the Transportation Takeover Group show that over 200 types of public property, totaling more than 40,000 items, have been collected from enthusiastic worker contributions. Many of these are valuable machines and instruments. Workers have been widely involved in the inventory organizations of various factories and institutions. When the Northwest Steel Plant conducted departmental inventory, it specifically hired experienced veteran workers familiar with the department's situation to participate. This practice made the working class keenly aware that they are the masters of the new China.

    太原职工
    踊跃献交公物
    热情参加清点
    【太原电】在太原发动职工献交公物参加清点，已成为一种群众运动。仅就西北制造厂、晋兴机械厂、西北窑厂、煤矿第一厂、育才厂、城外面粉厂、西北炼钢厂、西北印刷厂、交通接管组等单位的初步统计：收集到职工踊跃献交的公物，达二百余种，四万多件。其中有不少是贵重的机器、仪器。在各工厂和机关清点的组织中，广泛吸收了工人参加。西北炼钢厂在分课清点时，特别聘请熟悉该课情况的老工人参加。这种做法，使工人阶级锐敏地感觉到自己是新中国的主人。
