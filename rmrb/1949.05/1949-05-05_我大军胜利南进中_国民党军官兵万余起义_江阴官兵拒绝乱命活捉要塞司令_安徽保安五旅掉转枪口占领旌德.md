Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 4th: Delayed news: When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang Jiangyin Fortress staged a battlefield uprising and captured alive the fortress commander, Dai Rongguang, who resolutely carried out anti-people's illegal orders and ordered the bombardment of the PLA crossing the river. Several days before the liberation of Jiangyin Fortress, Li Yannian, Deputy Commander of the bandit army's First Pacification Zone, accompanied his master, an American advisor, to inspect the Huangshan Battery in Jiangyin. Ding Zhipan, the commander of the pacification zone, immediately pieced together an artillery general team, a garrison general team, a guerrilla artillery regiment, an engineering battalion, and other forces, totaling more than 3,000 men, to reinforce Huangshan and ordered them to defend this gateway to the Yangtze River to the death. However, on the 21st, when the PLA began its forced crossing from the north bank, very few people fired from the fortress. The bandit Dai Rongguang shouted anxiously on the phone, "Why aren't you firing! You will lose your heads if you lose the fortress!" Then, the rumbling fortress guns sounded, but some of the shells were out of range, some of the shells had their detonators removed, and some of the exploding shells fell on the Jiangfang positions of the bandit 21st Army. The bandit Dai hurriedly called Tang Binglin, the chief of the artillery general station, to see him. Tang ignored him. The bandit Dai then directly called the commander of the large platform to shoot. The commander of the large platform also ignored him. Finally, the bandit Dai wanted to direct his trusted Second Brigade to fight, but the telephone line to the Second Brigade had been cut. At this time, the PLA had landed on the south bank and quickly defeated the bandit 21st Army, occupying Huangshangang, Hucao Port, Zhangjiagang, and other places. The officers and soldiers on the fortress, led by Tang Binglin, the chief of the general station, Wang Derong, the commander of the guerrilla artillery regiment, and Li Yuncai, the commander of the garrison general team, staged a battlefield uprising. They captured the bandit Dai Rongguang alive. Most of the more than 7,000 officers and soldiers of the fortress surrendered. And the fortress guns were turned around and bombarded the bandit army's 21st Army, which was fleeing south.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 2nd: Delayed news: When the People's Liberation Army advanced victoriously towards southern Anhui Province, the entire 5,300 officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang Anhui Provincial Security Fifth Brigade revolted on April 24 in their stationed areas of Taiping, Jixi, and Xiuning, and joined the People's Liberation Army; and immediately occupied Jingde County, resolving the local Kuomintang team of more than 100 people.

    我大军胜利南进中
    国民党军官兵万余起义
    江阴官兵拒绝乱命活捉要塞司令
    安徽保安五旅掉转枪口占领旌德
    【新华社长江前线四日电】迟到消息：国民党江阴要塞官兵，在人民解放军横渡长江时，举行战场起义，并活捉了坚决执行反人民乱命。下令轰击渡江解放军的要塞司令戴戎光。江阴要塞解放前数日，匪军第一绥靖区副司令官李延年曾陪同他的主子美国顾问到江阴黄山炮台视察，该绥区司令官丁治磐旋即拼凑起炮兵总队、守备总队、游击炮团、工兵营等三千余人增防黄山、下令死守这个长江门户的要塞。但是二十一日解放军自北岸开始强渡时，要塞上却很少有人射击。戴匪戎光急的在电话里直喊：“怎么不打！失掉要塞要杀你们的头！”于是，隆隆的要塞炮响起来了，但有的射程是超距离的，有的射出的炮弹是已摘掉了引火帽的，还有一些爆炸的炮弹却纷纷落在匪二十一军的江防阵地上。戴匪慌忙打电话要炮台总台长唐秉琳见他。唐不理他。戴匪又直接打电话指挥大台长射击。大台长也不理他。最后，戴匪想指挥他的亲信二大队打，但是通二大队的电话线已被剪断了。这时解放军已经登陆南岸，迅速的击溃了匪二十一军，占领了黄山港、护漕港、张家港等地。要塞上官兵也就在总台长唐秉琳、游击炮团团长王德容、守备总队长李云蔡等率领下举行战场起义。他们活捉了戴匪戎光。要塞七千余官兵大部归顺。而要塞炮则调转了炮口，朝着向南溃散的匪军二十一军轰击起来。
    【新华社长江前线二日电】迟到：当人民解放军向安徽省南部胜利挺进时，国民党安徽省保安第五旅全体官兵五千三百余人于四月二十四日在太平、绩溪、休宁等驻地起义参加人民解放军；并即占领旌德县城，解决该县国民党地方团队百余人。
