Editorial Notes

　　The Cry of the Entire German People
    People's organizations throughout Germany, regardless of whether they are in the Soviet zone or the American, British, and French occupation zones, have issued a common and powerful call: demanding the unification of Germany and demanding a just peace! No German can remain silent while the foreign ministers' conference discusses the German question. They understand that if the path of the Potsdam Agreement is followed, the resurgence of Nazi militarism can be eradicated, and Germany can be guaranteed to become a member of the peaceful and democratic world. This is also the suggestion of Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky. If the path of division pursued by the United States, Britain, and France is followed, Germany will be dismembered, the financial groups will gain power, and Hitler's followers will regain control, making the lives of the people in West Germany even worse and depriving them of their democratic rights and interests! These are two strikingly contrasting paths before the German people! The entire German people know which path they should follow, and they have already cried out their demands. Acheson and his ilk should listen to this powerful cry at this time, and they should also use their brains to recall the lesson of Hitler's self-immolation.

　　全德人民的吼声
    全德各地人民团体，不分苏占区或美英法联占区，都发出共同的强有力的呼声：要求德国的统一，要求公正的和平！任何一个德国人民都不能在外长会议讨论德国问题时保持缄默，他们明白：如果按照波茨坦协定的路线走，便能根除纳粹军国主义的再起，保证德国成为和平民主世界的一员，这也同时是苏联外长维辛斯基的建议；如果按照美英法的分裂路线走，便是德国的肢解，财阀的得势，希特勒分子重新掌权，使今日的西德人民生活更趋恶化，民主权利益被剥夺！这是摆在德国人民面前对比如此强烈的两条路线！全德人民知道应该循着那一条路线走的，他们已吼出了自己的呼声。艾奇逊之流应该在这时倾听一下这个有力量的呼声，而且也应该用脑子回忆一下希特勒自焚的教训。
