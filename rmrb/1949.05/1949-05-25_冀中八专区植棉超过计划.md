(Jizhong Electric) The planting of cotton in the Eighth and Ninth Special Districts has achieved great results. Peanut planting and seedling protection campaigns are now underway. As of May 10th, the Eighth Special District had planted more than 388,000 mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan of 350,000 mu; more than 32,000 mu of peanuts have also been planted. In the Ninth Special District, it is estimated that more than 950,000 mu of cotton have been planted, reaching about 80% of the original plan. During the planting campaign, the counties in the Eighth Special District generally paid attention to mobilizing and organizing the broad masses, especially mobilizing women. For example, in Gaizhuang in the Fifth District, 60 out of 80 women aged sixteen to fifty participated in planting. Two women in the village who could not carry water buckets used baskets with basins to carry water, and some used vases from their weddings to carry water. After planting, there was still no rain, and some cotton seedlings were killed by the dry wind. Therefore, both special districts are now rushing to plant peanuts and launching seedling protection campaigns.

　　冀中八专区植棉超过计划
    【冀中电】八九两专区种棉已获很大成绩。现正点种花生和开展保苗运动。截至五月十号统计，八专区已点种棉花三十八万八千余亩，超过了三十五万亩的原订计划；花生也已点种了三万二千余亩。九专区约计已完成种棉九十五万余亩，达到了原计划的百分之八十左右。在点种运动中，八专区各县一般是注意了发动与组织广大群众，特别是发动妇女。如五区盖庄，十六岁至五十岁的妇女共八十人，有六十人参加了点种。该村有两个妇女用水桶挑不动，就用筐放上盆来挑水，有的用结婚时的花瓶来挑水。点种后仍不下雨，有的棉苗被干风刮死。因此两专区都正在一面突击种花生，一面开展保苗运动。
