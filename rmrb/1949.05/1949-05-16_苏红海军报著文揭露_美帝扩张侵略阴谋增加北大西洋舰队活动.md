    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 14th: According to a United Press report from Moscow on the 11th, a commentator for the Soviet Red Navy newspaper recently published an article revealing that, in order to implement the North Atlantic Treaty, US imperialism has increased its fleet activity in the North Atlantic. The commentator pointed out that the imperialist bloc's naval policy became clear shortly after the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. Negotiations on the standardization of naval weapons and the coordination of armed forces are currently underway, and Britain has been forced to agree to the US standardization unification plan. The commentator also stated: In the past few days, it has been learned that the navies of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway are preparing for joint exercises. The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty are increasingly "concerned" about northern Norway, and they have already "persuaded" Norway to establish a special station for the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in northern Norway.
