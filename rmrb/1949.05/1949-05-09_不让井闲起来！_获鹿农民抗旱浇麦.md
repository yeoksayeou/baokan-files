    Don't Let the Wells Lie Idle!
    Huolu Farmers Fight Drought by Irrigating Wheat
    [Charhar News] Huolu farmers are actively irrigating wheat to combat the drought. In the seventh district, farmers from all villages, men and women, old and young, are actively irrigating the wheat, whether at noon, dusk, or even late at night, to fight the drought. Ma Xier and six others from Nanlonggui Village organized a wheat-watering mutual aid team, taking turns irrigating at noon and at night. Zheng Jinshu from Lijiazhuang led his entire family in pushing water carts to irrigate. Wang Fuxiao irrigated until late at night before returning home. In the ten villages including Xiangaocun, the second watering of the wheat is nearing completion; in the thirteen villages including Longgui, the first watering of the wheat has been completed, and the second watering is beginning. In Beizhang Village, Second District, the masses irrigated 150 mu of wheat in five or six days. When the village production committee began discussing irrigation, everyone felt there were many difficulties: few wells, and some households lacked labor. After discussion, everyone agreed that assigning labor to irrigate would overcome the difficulties. The next day, Farmers' Association Director Wang Luodong and farmer Wang Luobu took the lead in assigning labor to irrigate, irrigating two mu in two days. Wang Luoliang and Wang Luoguo shared a well, but due to a lack of labor, they assigned Wang Luochao to irrigate with them. In this way, households with wells but lacking labor and households with labor but lacking wells mutually benefited, irrigating nine mu of wheat in two days. Under the call of the village production committee and the influence of the leading cadres, all fifteen wells and two water carts in the village are now in operation, with shifts rotating even during mealtimes, achieving the goal of "not letting the wells lie idle."

    不让井闲起来！
    获鹿农民抗旱浇麦
    【察哈尔滨讯】获鹿农民积极浇麦抗旱。七区各村农民为了抗御天旱，男女老少不论晌午、傍晚，甚至深夜，积极下手浇麦。南龙贵村马喜儿等七人，组织了浇麦互助小组，利用中午、黑夜轮流浇。李家庄郑金书领着全家大小推着水车浇。王福校一直浇到深夜才回家。现高迁等十村，二水麦子即将浇完；龙贵等十三个村头水麦已全部浇完，开始放二水。二区北章村群众五、六天浇麦一百五十亩。村生产委员会开始讨论浇麦时，大家认为困难很多：井少，有的户缺乏劳动力。经讨论后，大家认为拨工浇，就会把困难克服了。第二天农会主任王洛栋与农民王洛卜首先拨工浇起来，两天浇了二亩。王洛良、王洛国两家伙着一眼井，但因劳力不足，便与王洛朝拨工浇，这样，使得有水井缺劳力而有劳力没水井的户，都互相得到了弥补，二天浇麦九亩。在村生产委员会的号召和干部带头影响下，现全村十五眼井、两辆水车都已动起来，在吃饭的时候还轮班浇，做到了“不让井闲起来”。
