　　Taiyuan Trading Company Trust Department
  　Purchases Goods on Behalf of Customers
  　Ensures Price Stability
    [Taiyuan Dispatch] Since the Taiyuan Municipal Trading Company Trust Department began operations on the 3rd, it has facilitated legitimate purchases for various public-owned enterprises, production organizations, and cooperatives in various regions, preventing speculation, panic buying, and indiscriminate purchasing. By the 8th, it had assisted more than 30 units in making purchases. The majority of procurement personnel are able to carry out procurement in accordance with the Military Control Commission's regulations: "Register with the Trust Department, issue a procurement list, pay the procurement funds, entrust the department to purchase on their behalf, or obtain a certificate from the department to purchase from designated shops and factories, and report the procurement results to the Trust Department." Legitimate purchasers feel that this is convenient. The Trust Department helped some production organizations and cooperatives sell the grain, flour, and other physical goods that they could not sell, and then helped them buy goods. Some private merchants also approached the Trust Department to inquire about market conditions and request introductions for procurement, and the Trust Department provided assistance as appropriate. Illegitimate purchases are restricted: for example, the Yuchi Tongtai Store and the Jiaocheng Public-owned Store were both stopped from commissioning private individuals to purchase copper in the city. The Daixian Public Security Bureau's organ for production purchased goods privately without reporting to the Trust Department and was only allowed to leave the city after criticism and providing a guarantee. Due to strict control from all sides, price stability has been ensured.

　　太原贸易公司信托部
  　代客采购货物
  　保证物价平稳
    【太原电】太原市贸易公司信托部自三日成立开始营业以来，便利了各公营事业生产机关及各地合作社之正当采购，防止了投机、抢购、乱购现象的发生。至八日已帮助三十多个单位进行了采购。大部采购人员均能按照军管会规定之“到信托部登记，开具采购清单，交付采购款项，委托该部代购，或由该部出具证明书到指定商号、工厂采购，并将采购结果报告信托部”的办法办理采购。正当的采购者均感到方便。某些生产机关合作社运来的粮食、面等实物卖不了，信托部帮助他们卖了，又帮助买上货物。有些私商也找到信托部，打问行情要求介绍采购，信托部分别酌量给以帮助。不正当的采购则受到限止：如榆次同太商店、交城公营商店，委托私人到本市收买铜，均被制止。代县公安局机关生产没报告信托部即私自购买，经批评具保后才准予出城。由于各方面的严格管制，保证了物价的平稳。
