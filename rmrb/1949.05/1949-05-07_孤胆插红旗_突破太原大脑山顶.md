From the Taiyuan Front:

　　Red Flag Raised Alone
　　Breakthrough at the Summit of Brain Mountain in Taiyuan

　　On the morning of April 20th, our army broke through the Brain Mountain position, twenty li northeast of Taiyuan. The deputy battalion commander of the 600th Regiment, 3rd Battalion, saw the enemy fleeing from Brain Mountain to the west. Thinking there were no more enemies on the mountain, he handed the red flag to Cheng Hai, ordering him to "Plant it on the summit of Brain Mountain!" Cheng Hai ran along a winding, snake-like path, all the way up to the mountainside. Suddenly, there was no road. Sweating and panting, he looked around. The mountainside was cut into sheer cliffs, impossible to climb without wings. Cheng Hai circled the mountain, trying to find a way up, but was discovered by the enemy. Bullets flew straight at him. He hesitated, then pulled the red flag from his back, thinking of planting it on the mountainside. But he remembered the deputy battalion commander's certain tone when assigning the task. He turned and went around to the east side of the mountain, where he found a cave leading upward. With the determination of one who fears no tiger's den, he plunged inside. He walked along the inner trench upwards, with gunfire from both northern and southern bunkers. He steeled himself, picked up a grenade, and charged the southern bunker with his bayonet. Bang! Bang! Four grenades exploded on the bunker, raising rolling clouds of smoke. Cheng Hai shouted sternly, "Come out! Surrender your weapons! Spare your lives if you surrender, or no one will live!" He saw a dirt-covered fellow, trembling, raise his hands and crawl out of the smoke, saying, "We surrender." "Bring out the guns! No one else move!" "Yes! Yes! Yes!" Fourteen guns were carried out and handed to Cheng Hai. Cheng Hai ordered him, "Go back and tell them, no one is allowed to move." Cheng Hai himself went around to the front of the northern bunker, used two grenades, and captured the enemy's guns, just like at the southern bunker. Afterward, Cheng Hai proudly ran up the mountain and planted the red flag on the summit of Brain Mountain.

    孤胆插红旗
    突破太原大脑山顶
    四月二十日早晨，我军把太原东北二十里的大脑阵地突破了，六○○团三营副营长看见大脑山敌人从西面跑掉了，以为山头上没有了敌人，便把红旗交给成海，命令他说：“把他插到大脑山顶上！”成海沿着一条蜿蜒的蛇形小径，一直跑上了山腰，忽然没有路了，他挥着汗、喘呼呼的向四处张望，山坡都切成直立的峭壁，除了会飞是上不去的。成海正围着山转，还没找到上去的路，反被敌人发现了，一颗颗枪弹直飞过来。他犹豫了一下，从身后拔下红旗，想把它就插在山腰，但是他一想副营长交待任务时是那么肯定，他一扭身绕到山的东面去，发现了一个通向上面的山洞，就以不怕虎穴的决心，一伏身钻了进去。他沿着里面的交通壕向上面走，南北两堡垒里都向他打枪，他抖了抖精神拿起飞雷，端着刺刀扑向南边的堡垒，轰！轰！四个飞雷在堡垒上响了，震起了滚滚的烟尘。成海厉声的喊：“出来！缴枪！饶你们的命，不缴枪半个别想活”，他看到一个混身泥土的家伙，哆哆嗦嗦的举着双手从烟尘里钻出来说：“我们缴枪。”“把枪抱出来，别人不准动！”“是！是！是！”十四支枪抱出来交给成海，成海命令他：“回去告诉他们，谁也不许动。”成海自己绕到北面堡垒前面，用了两个飞雷，又和南堡垒一样缴了敌人的枪。以后，成海骄傲的跑上山去，把红旗插到大脑山顶上。
