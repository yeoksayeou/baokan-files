　　Delegation Members Share Their Impressions
　　Professors Xu Deheng and Zhang Xiruo said: "On April 23rd, the news of the liberation of Nanjing reached Prague. That evening, Czech students flocked to the Chinese delegation's hotel, repeatedly cheering us: 'Long live Mao Zedong, China!' Our representatives were lifted up and paraded in celebration. The victorious glory of the Chinese people's liberation shone upon Europe and Czechoslovakia." Zhang Xiruo also said: "World peace can certainly be ensured. The forces for world peace are greater and stronger than we estimated at home."
　　Xu Guangping said: "The news of the Chinese people's victorious liberation stirred every peace-loving person in Czechoslovakia. This has significant implications for world peace. We must remember well: this is what the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has given us; this is what the wise leadership of the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao, has given us; this is what the brave and skillful Chinese People's Liberation Army has given us."
　　Professor Deng Chumin said: "When the chairman announced the news of the liberation of Nanjing, an unprecedented scene immediately erupted on and off the stage: clapping, jumping, kissing, hugging, cheering lasted for as long as twenty minutes. The Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao, received the love of representatives from seventy-two countries. The cries of 'Long live Mao Zedong' shook the heavens and the earth. Many representatives shed tears of joy. The great victory of the Chinese people guaranteed world peace."
　　Student representative Qu Yuan said: "The biggest feeling from participating in this peace conference is that China's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level. The Chinese people have not only stood up domestically, but also internationally. This time, the Chinese representatives received a warm welcome from people of various countries. When the Chinese delegation arrived in Prague, representatives from various countries solemnly and grandly sang different national anthems to welcome us, and the ground was covered with red carpets. In the conference, the Soviet and Chinese representatives were the most popular. During the meeting, we established close ties with the International Student Union, Czech youth, Romanian youth, and Indonesian youth. We exchanged experiences in student movement struggles, and everyone praised the victory of Chinese liberation."
　　Ye Weimin, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, talked about the enthusiastic situation in Prague following the liberation of Nanjing, and then said: "A female Soviet representative, seeing the enthusiastic respect shown by representatives of various countries to the Chinese representatives, was moved to tears. A female Romanian representative came to me on the morning of the day after the liberation of Nanjing, asking for a badge with a portrait of Chairman Mao. I apologized and replied that there were none left. She showed great disappointment. She had such sincere love and admiration for Chairman Mao."
　　Youth representative Chen Jiakang said: "During the peace conference, Czechoslovak youth held a Prague youth get-together, inviting Soviet and Chinese representatives to attend and speak. On that day, the news of the liberation of Nanjing reached Czechoslovakia. After the meeting, more than 500 Czech youths flocked to the hotel where the Chinese representatives were staying to celebrate and revel, which was very enthusiastic."
　　Cao Yu said: "At this conference, the Chinese and Soviet delegations were the most noticed and welcomed. The Chinese delegation received a warm welcome along the way, like being treated as family members. The biggest feeling from our two-month trip is that we must strengthen our learning, especially learning from the Soviet Union."

　　代表团员畅谈观感
    许德衍、张奚若教授说：“四月二十三日，南京解放的消息传到了布拉格。当天晚上，捷克的青年学生拥到中国代表团的旅馆里，连向我们欢呼：‘毛泽东，中国，万岁！’我们的代表被他们高举起来欢呼游行，中国人民解放的胜利光辉照耀到欧洲和捷克。”张奚若又说：“世界和平一定能够确保，世界和平的力量比我们在国内所估计的要伟大坚强得多。”
    许广平说：“中国人民解放胜利的消息传到捷克，激荡得每个爱好和平的人士兴奋不已。这对于世界和平有着很重大的意义。我们要好好的记住：这是中国共产党正确领导所给予我们的，这是中国人民领袖毛主席英明领导所给予我们的，这是中国人民解放军英勇善战所给予我们的。”
    邓初民教授说：“当主席宣布南京解放的消息时，台上，台下，立即掀起了空前未有的场面：拍掌、跳跃、接吻、拥抱、欢呼，竟达二十分钟之久，中国人民领袖毛主席受到了七十二个国家人民代表的热爱，‘毛泽东万岁’之声震动天地。许多代表欢乐得流下了眼泪，中国人民伟大的胜利保障了世界的和平。”
    学生代表屈元说：“这次参加和平大会最大的感觉就是中国在国际上的地位空前的提高了，中国人民不仅在国内翻了身，在国际上也翻了身。这次中国代表受到各国人民热烈的欢迎，当中国代表团到达布拉格时，各国代表庄严隆重的唱着不同的国歌来欢迎我们，地上铺满了红色的毡子。在大会中，苏联和中国的代表最受欢迎。在开会期间，我们与国际学联、捷克青年、罗马尼亚青年、印度尼西亚青年都有了密切的连系，大家交换了学生运动斗争的经验，大家共同赞扬着中国解放的胜利。”
    全国总工会代表叶维民谈了南京解放在布拉格掀起的热烈情形，接着说：“一位苏联的女代表看到各国代表对中国代表这样热烈的致敬，她被感动得淌下眼泪。一位罗马尼亚的女代表在南京解放的第二天上午，走过来向我要一个有毛主席像的证章，我向她抱歉的回答说没有了，她表现出很大的失望，她是那样热诚的爱戴毛主席。”
    青年代表陈家康说：“在和平大会开会期间，捷克斯洛伐克青年开布拉格青年联欢会，请苏联和中国的代表出席讲话，就在那一天南京解放的消息传到捷克，当散会后，捷克五百余青年拥到中国代表住的旅馆里，庆祝狂欢，非常热烈。”
    曹禺说：“在这次大会上中、苏两国代表团是最受注意和欢迎的，中国代表团沿路受到象家里人一样亲切的欢迎。这次我们行程两月，最大的感想就是觉得要加强学习，尤其是向苏联学习。”
