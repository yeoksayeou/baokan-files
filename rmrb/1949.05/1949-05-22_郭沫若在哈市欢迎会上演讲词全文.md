Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, who was late to arrive, delivered a speech at the Harbin All-Circles Welcome Rally on the 15th. The full text of the speech:

　　Chairman! Fellow compatriots of Harbin City!

　　At the beginning of April, when we went abroad, we were warmly seen off by our dear compatriots here. Today, as we return from abroad, we are once again warmly welcomed by our dear compatriots here. This makes us, the members of the delegation, feel supremely honored and supremely inspired.

　　The Chairman praised us for "returning in victory," and the banners of the compatriots also read "returning in victory." This means that the Peace Congress was successful, and therefore we also achieved victory.

　　But we clearly know that this victory, in China's case, was given to us by the compatriots of the whole of China, by the heroic People's Liberation Army, and by the great people's leader, Chairman Mao. We must first express our greatest sincerity to the compatriots of the entire Northeast and the entire China who are working hard to produce and support the front lines, to the heroic People's Liberation Army, and to the wise leader Chairman Mao.

　　The Peace Congress was held simultaneously in Paris and Prague. Both opened on April 20 and closed on April 25. One congress, two venues, with a total of 72 participating countries, 2,005 delegates, representing more than 800 million people. In a spirit of harmony, warmth, and unity, we reached a unified declaration and resolution: The peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union must strengthen its unity, resolutely oppose the imperialists' plot to provoke a third world war, oppose atomic weapons, oppose the new fascism that dominates the world; and use the strong power of the people of the world to strive for lasting world peace.

　　The Peace Congress concluded smoothly, and a permanent institution was established in Paris. Participating countries should organize branches in their respective countries to extend the work of striving for world peace to cities and villages around the world. Therefore, our work remains behind. The success of the Peace Congress is not yet the success of the cause of striving for peace. We must, in the spirit of the declaration and resolution of the Congress, use the power of the Chinese people to cooperate closely with the people of the world to strive for the final victory of the democratic peace camp.

　　Compatriots! Regarding everything that happened after we went abroad and participated in the conference, after returning to Beiping, we are preparing to write a detailed report and dedicate it to Chairman Mao and to the compatriots of the whole country. We spent almost all of our fifty days abroad traveling, taking planes and trains, traveling back and forth for 20,000 kilometers. We have not had enough time to organize our data. Therefore, we ask the compatriots to forgive us, and today we can only report to the compatriots some fragmented feelings after we went abroad.

　　Compatriots, we went abroad after the People's Liberation Army liberated the entire Northeast, liberated the Huaihai area, liberated Pingjin, and achieved continuous great victories. First of all, we can feel that the international status of our Chinese people has been unprecedentedly enhanced.

　　We passed through the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people gave us the most cordial treatment, sending representatives and locomotives all the way to Manchuria to welcome us; when we returned home, they also sent representatives and trains all the way to escort us to Manchuria. When flying, the most excellent pilots were selected to drive for us. They gave us every convenience and treated us as honored guests. This deep friendship is truly unforgettable for us.

　　In mid-April, we took a train from the Soviet Union into the new democratic country of Czechoslovakia, and the Czech people also gave us the most cordial treatment. Along the way, at the main stations, there were large crowds preparing music teams to welcome us, and representatives from all aspects of the party, government, military, and people's organizations came to give us welcome speeches, present us with flowers, and embrace us. All the way to the Czech capital, Prague, it was like this. At the Prague train station, they laid red carpets for us. During our stay, they treated us as honored guests in the same way, giving us every convenience. This deep friendship is truly unforgettable for us.

　　In the middle of the Peace Congress, on April 23, the news of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Nanjing reached Europe. At the two venues in Prague and Paris, all the representatives stood up and cheered enthusiastically, shouting "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!" constantly applauding, applauding, applauding; shaking hands, shaking hands, shaking hands; embracing, embracing, embracing. Some foreign representatives even shed tears of joy, and the hall roared for a full twenty minutes. This deep friendship is truly unforgettable for us.

　　Compatriots! We truly felt supreme glory abroad. But this glory belongs to all the Chinese people, and to our great people's leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's name resounded throughout the world, and Chairman Mao's name became a symbol of people's democracy and true peace. With Chairman Mao in China, the international status of our China has indeed been unprecedentedly enhanced.

　　The victory of the Chinese people not only enhanced our international status, but also strengthened the strong unity and the conviction of victory of the people all over the world.

　　Mr. Tsedenbal, the head of the Mongolian delegation, personally told us: When the Japanese imperialists dominated the Far East, our Mongolian people could not rest assured at all. Now that democratic China has become the leader of the East, our Mongolian people can rest assured from now on.

　　Mr. Dabo Sé, a liaison representative from the Paris Congress to the Prague Congress, a black man from Africa, spoke at the Prague Congress: Mao Zedong is also the savior of the African people. With the liberation of the Chinese people, we African people also have hope.

　　Mr. Fadeyev, the head of the Soviet delegation, also said to our Chinese delegation: I am proud to dare to say such a sentence to any war-monger: The British and American imperialists concluded the robber-like North Atlantic Treaty, and got a small country of Luxembourg with a population of less than one million to participate, while our World Peace Congress got China with a population of 475 million to participate.

　　Compatriots, these representatives' words are very sincere. They completely regarded the victory of the Chinese people as their own victory; they regarded the victory of the Chinese people as an important factor in striving for world peace.

　　Compatriots, this is not an exaggeration at all. Our China is a very large overseas market for imperialism, and our East is mainly a colony or semi-colony of imperialism. With the liberation of our Chinese people, the national independence movements in the colonies or semi-colonies of the Far East will inevitably be further encouraged, and will inevitably achieve their goals sooner or later. Colonies and overseas markets are the lifeline of imperialism. Once colonies and overseas markets are lost, imperialism itself will only perish. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people undoubtedly promoted the liberation of all mankind and promoted the demise of imperialism. The victory of the Chinese people is also undoubtedly a guarantee of peace in the Far East and a guarantee of world peace.

　　It is no accident that peace-loving people all over the world welcome the victory of our Chinese people. It is by no means accidental that 2,005 representatives from 72 countries at the World Peace Congress all welcomed the victory of our Chinese people.

　　The victory of our Chinese people has brought about a major change in the balance of power between the two major camps in the world. The power of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union in the world has indeed far surpassed the power of the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism due to the victory of the Chinese people!

　　Therefore, the victory of our Chinese people has made a great contribution to the World Peace Congress. With the participation of our Chinese delegation in the World Peace Congress, it has indeed become an important factor in the progress of the Congress. The Soviet representative once said to us: The Chinese delegation is the soul of the Prague Congress. The general report of the Chinese delegation is a model for the conference report. They said this very sincerely, and our report was broadcast in various languages to the whole country in the Soviet Union. On our way home, our plane stopped in Novosibirsk and Irkutsk. According to the local person in charge, as soon as they received the broadcast from Moscow, they immediately broadcast it, and they considered it a very powerful speech.

　　Compatriots, we cite these facts not to express our own merits. In fact, we, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, told the world what the compatriots wanted to say. We expressed to the world the Chinese people's unyielding anti-imperialist and anti-feudal fighting spirit, promoted the achievements of the People's Liberation Army, exposed the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, announced the demise of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek, and especially emphasized the clear proposition of domestic leadership by the vanguard of the proletariat and international leadership by the peace fortress of the Soviet Union. This is the voice of our Chinese people. It goes without saying that it is a great encouragement to the European people, and it goes without saying that it is also a great encouragement to the representatives attending the Peace Congress. There is no doubt that the will of the Chinese people played a major role in the progress of the conference and in the declaration and resolutions of the conference.

　　Of course, we cannot forget that the success of the Peace Congress was contributed to by the people of all countries. And especially the peace fortress of the Soviet Union has made the greatest contribution. It was the unwavering peace policy of the great leader of mankind, Stalin, that awakened the peace-loving people all over the world, united the peace-loving forces all over the world, unanimously opposed imperialist aggression, and strived for the independence and autonomy of all nations.

　　The success of the World Peace Congress is the success of the Soviet Union's peace policy. The 2,005 representatives from 72 countries who participated in the conference unanimously praised the Soviet Union and Stalin, and were willing to unite under the leadership of the Soviet Union and work together. This is also no accident.

　　Regarding the situation in the Soviet Union, we were very fortunate this time to have the opportunity to visit after participating in the Peace Congress, which took a full ten days. The Soviet people, both men and women, participated in the work of peaceful construction with the greatest efforts. The construction in all aspects is progressing at a rapid pace. The post-war five-year plan has exceeded the pre-set figures every year, and almost all the damage suffered in the war has been restored. In particular, the Soviet workers are not only rewarding the Stakhanov movement, but also rewarding the Zotov movement. The Stakhanov movement is to pursue the improvement of production volume, and the Zotov movement is to pursue the improvement of production quality, not only seeking more quantity, but also seeking more precision in quality. The spirit of this production movement is worth learning from us.

　　We participated in the "May Day" Labor Day parade in Moscow, the grand review in Red Square. We saw with our own eyes the powerful lineup of the Soviet people's armed forces. All kinds of sophisticated weapons, under extremely skilled manipulation, passed one after another in front of us. We saw with our own eyes the fast-speed aircraft, the speed faster than the sound, flying eight hundred kilometers per hour, the aircraft flying over our heads, and then we heard the rumbling sound. We saw with our own eyes the mass parade of two million people, which started at 10 am and walked until 5 pm, before it finished walking like a tide in the sea from the vast Red Square. We even saw with our own eyes Stalin and the leaders of the Soviet government standing on Lenin's mausoleum to personally review, also standing from 10 am until 5 pm. What an amazing health, what a democratic demeanor! The sound of "Long live Stalin!" shook the heaven and the earth. Such a grand and magnificent scene is unforgettable for us forever.

　　The leader and the people are one, and the people and the armed forces are one. This not only guarantees the success of the Soviet socialist construction, but also guarantees the inevitable victory in striving for the world.

　　The road taken by the Soviet people should be the road that our Chinese people should take. Our Chinese people should learn from the Soviet Union and strive to catch up with the Soviet Union.

　　Under the strong leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese liberation war will soon achieve a comprehensive victory. Under the strong leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese construction must also quickly achieve a comprehensive victory. In order to achieve these two goals—the comprehensive victory of the revolutionary war and the comprehensive victory of the construction cause—all of our Chinese people must redouble our efforts, promote the patriotic spirit of practicing internationalism, and quickly reach the socialist stage through the path of new democracy.

　　China's revolutionary victory and the success of industrialization are inseparable from the work of safeguarding world peace. With the success of China's revolution and the success of industrialization, not only is China's peace guaranteed, but also the peace of the Far East and even the peace of the world are guaranteed.

　　Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the success of the New Democracy!

　　Long live the victory of lasting world peace!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　郭沫若在哈市欢迎会上演讲词全文
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】迟到：出席世界拥护和平大会中国代表团团长郭沫若十五日在哈尔滨各界欢迎会上发表演讲，讲词全文：主席！哈尔滨市的同胞们！
    在四月初头我们出国的时候，承蒙亲爱的同胞们热烈地在这儿欢送了我们；今天我们从国外归来，又承蒙亲爱的同胞们在这儿热烈地欢迎我们，这使我们代表团同人感到无上的光荣，无上的振奋。
    主席称誉我们是“胜利归来”，同胞们的旗帜上也写着我们“胜利归来”的字样。这是说和平大会获得了成功，因而我们也就获得了胜利。
    但这胜利我们明确地知道，在我们中国方面，是全中国的同胞们所给予我们的胜利，是英勇的人民解放军所给予我们的胜利，是伟大的人民领袖毛主席所给予我们的胜利。我们首先要以最大的诚意向努力生产、支援前线的全东北、全中国的同胞们致敬，向英勇的人民解放军致敬，向英明的领袖毛主席致敬。
    和平大会是在巴黎和布拉格两地同时召开的。同在四月二十号开幕，四月二十五号闭幕。一个大会，两个会场，参加的国家一共七十二个，代表人数二千零五人，所代表的人民在八万万以上。我们在和谐、热烈、团结的精神里面，得到了同一的宣言，同一的决议：以苏联为首的和平民主阵营要加强团结，坚决反对帝国主义者挑拨第三次世界大战的阴谋，反对原子武器，反对独霸全世界的新法西斯主义；要用全世界人民的坚强的力量，来争取全世界的持久和平。
    和平大会是顺利地结束了，在巴黎成立了一个永久的机构。参加大会的国家要在各国组织分会，把争取世界和平的工作，推广到全世界的城市和乡村。因此，我们的工作还留在后面。和平大会的成功，还不是争取和平事业的成功，我们还得本着大会的宣言和决议的精神，用全中国人民的力量来和全世界人民密切合作，争取民主和平阵营的最后胜利。
    同胞们！关于我们出国以后，和参加大会的一切经过情形，我们回到北平以后，准备写出一部详细的报告书奉献给毛主席，奉献给全国的同胞。我们出国五十天差不多一直都在旅行当中，乘飞机、乘火车，往返了两万公里。我们还没有充分的工夫来整理我们的资料。因此，我们要请同胞们原谅，我们今天只能向同胞们报告一下我们出国以后的零碎的感想。
    同胞们，我们是在人民解放军解放了全东北，解放了淮海地区，解放了平津，接连不断的伟大胜利之后出国，首先我们能觉着的是我们中国人民的国际地位空前的提高了。
    我们经过了苏联，苏联人民给我们以最亲切的待遇，派了代表和机车一直到满洲里来欢迎我们；当我们回国的时候，也派了代表和火车一直把我们护送到满洲里。坐飞机是选最优秀的飞机师替我们驾驶。他们给我们一切的方便，把我们当成了上宾。这样深厚的友谊，真真是使我们永远不能忘记的。
    在四月中旬，我们乘火车由苏联进入新民主主义国家捷克的国家，捷克人民也同样给我们以最亲切的待遇。沿途主要的车站上，都有广大的群众准备着音乐队来欢迎我们，党政军人民团体各方面的代表都来向我们致欢迎词，向我们献花，和我们拥抱。一直到捷克的首都布拉格，都是如此。在布拉格火车站上，他们为我们敷上了红毡。在我们滞留的期间，同样地把我们当成上宾，给了我们一切的方便。这样深厚的友谊真真是使我们永远不能忘记的。
    在和平大会开会的期中，四月二十三号人民解放军解放南京的消息传到了欧洲，在布拉格和巴黎的两个会场上全体代表都一致起立热烈的欢呼，高呼“毛泽东万岁！”“中国人民解放万岁！”不断地鼓掌，鼓掌，鼓掌；握手，握手，握手；拥抱，拥抱，拥抱，有好些外国的代表们甚至欢喜得流出眼泪，足足哄堂了二十分钟。这样深厚的友谊，真真是使我们永远不能忘记的。
    同胞们！我们在国外真真是感到了无上的光荣了。但这光荣是属于我们全中国人民的，属于我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席的。毛主席的名字响遍了全世界，毛主席的名字成为了人民民主和真正和平的标帜。我们中国有了毛主席，我们中国的国际地位的确是空前的提高了。
    中国人民的胜利不仅提高了我们的国际地位，同时增强了全世界人民力量的坚强的团结和必胜的信念。
    蒙古代表团的团长齐登巴尔先生曾经亲自告诉我们说：远东在日本帝国主义称霸的时候，我们蒙古人民是一点也不能放心的，现在民主中国做了东方的盟主，我们蒙古人民从此可以放心了。
    从巴黎大会派遣到布拉格大会的一位联络代表，非洲的黑人达波赛先生，他在布拉格大会上发言：毛泽东同时是非洲人民的救星，中国人民得到解放，我们非洲人民也就有了希望了。
    苏联代表团的团长法捷耶夫先生也对着我们中国代表团说：我很夸耀的敢向任何战争贩子们说出这样一句话：英美帝国主义缔结了强盗式的北大西洋公约，得到了一个人口不足一百万的卢森堡小国参加，而我们的世界和平大会却得到了人口四万万七千五百万的中国参加。
    同胞们，这些代表们的说话都是非常诚恳的，他们是把中国人民的胜利，完全当成了自己的胜利；把中国人民的胜利看成为争取世界和平的一个重要的因素。
    同胞们，这是一点也没有夸大的。我们中国是帝国主义的一个极大的海外市场，而我们东方则主要是帝国主义的殖民地或半殖民地。我们中国人民得到解放，远东的殖民地或半殖民地的民族独立运动，必然更受到鼓舞，而早迟必会达到目的。殖民地和海外市场是帝国主义的生命线，殖民地和海外市场一失掉，帝国主义本身也就只有灭亡了。因此，中国人民的胜利不折不扣地是促进了全人类的解放，促进了帝国主义的灭亡，中国人民的胜利也不折不扣地是远东和平的保障，世界和平的保障。
    全世界爱好和平的人民欢迎我们中国人民的胜利，这不是偶然的。在世界和平大会上七十二国二千零五位代表都欢迎我们中国人民的胜利，这决不是偶然的。
    我们中国人民的胜利使世界两大对垒的力量对比发生了重大的变化。全世界以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量，由于中国人民的胜利，的确远远地超过了以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的力量了！
    因此，我们中国人民的胜利对于世界和平大会有了很大的贡献。世界和平大会有了我们中国的代表团参加，对于大会的进行，的确是成为了一个重要的因素。苏联的代表曾经对我们这样说：中国代表团是布拉格大会的灵魂。中国代表团的总报告是大会报告的模范。他们说这话是很诚恳的，我们的报告在苏联用各种言语向全国广播了的。在我们回国的途中，我们的飞机在新西伯利亚伊尔库次克都停留过，据当地的负责人告诉我们：他们一接收到莫斯科的广播，便立即广播了出去，他们认为是很有力量的发言。
    同胞们，我们举出这些事实，并不是想来表述我们自己的功劳，事实上，我们是本着毛主席的指示，把同胞们所要说的话向全世界说出来了。我们向全世界表达了中国人民反帝反封建的不屈不挠的斗志，发扬了人民解放军的战绩，揭穿了美帝国主义的侵略野心，宣布了反动派蒋介石的灭亡，特别是强调了国内以无产阶级的先锋队为领导，国际以和平堡垒苏联为领导的明确主张，这是我们中国人民的声音，对于欧洲人民不用说是一个很大的鼓励，对于出席和平大会的代表们不用说也是一个很大的鼓励。在大会进行上，和大会的宣言及决议上，中国人民的意志起了重大的作用，的确是毫无疑问的。
    当然，我们并不能忘记，和平大会的成功，各国的人民都有了他的贡献。而尤其是和平堡垒的苏联有着最大的贡献。这是伟大的人类领袖斯大林坚定不移的和平政策把全世界爱好和平的人民唤醒了，使全世界爱好和平的力量团结了起来，一致反对帝国主义的侵略，努力争取各个民族的独立自主。
    世界和平大会的成功是苏联和平政策的成功，参加大会的七十二国二千零五位代表都一致称颂苏联，称颂斯大林，都甘愿在苏联的领导之下团结一致，共同奋斗，这也决不是偶然的。
    关于苏联的情形我们这一次很幸运地在参加了和平大会之后，得到了参观的机会，整整花费了十天的时间。苏联人民无分男女都以最大努力参加着和平建设的工作。各方面的建设都以突飞猛进的速度进展。战后五年计划每年都超过了预定的数字，战争中所遭受的毁坏差不多全部恢复了。尤其是苏联的工人，一面在奖励斯达哈诺夫运动，一面又在奖励佐的基夫运动。斯达哈诺夫的运动是追求生产量的提高，佐的基夫运动是追求生产质的提高，不仅量求其多，而且质求其精。这种生产运动的精神是值得我们学习的。
    我们在莫斯科曾经参加了“五一”劳动节，红场的大检阅。我们亲眼看见了苏联人民武力的强大的阵容。各种精锐武器在极熟练的操纵之下接一连二地在我们的面前走过。我们亲眼看到快速度的飞机，速度比声音还要快，一小时可飞八百公里，飞机从我们头上飞过之后，才听见轰隆的声音。我们亲眼看见两百万人的群众大游行，从上午十时起走到下午五时，才从广阔的红场上象海里面的潮水一样走完了。我们更亲眼看见斯大林和苏联政府领导人物，站在列宁墓上亲自检阅，从上午十时起也一直站到了下午五时。那是多么惊人的健康，多么民主的风度啊！“斯大林万岁！”的声音震荡着天地。这样盛大而又壮发的光景是使我们永远也不能忘记的。
    领袖和人民是一体，人民和武装力量是一体，这不仅保障了苏联社会主义建设的成功，而且是保障了争取世界的必然的胜利。
    苏联人民所走的路正应该是我们中国人民所要走的路。我们中国人民是应该向苏联看齐，向苏联努力追赶的。
    我们中国的解放战争在毛主席和中国共产党的坚强领导之下，很快便要得到全面的胜利了。我们中国的建设，在毛主席和在中国共产党的坚强领导之下，也必须很快地得到全面的胜利。为了达到这两重目的——革命战争的全面胜利与建设事业的全面胜利，我们全中国的人民必须加倍努力，发扬实践国际主义的爱国精神，迅速地通过新民主主义的道路达到社会主义的阶段。
    中国的革命胜利和工业化的成功，和保卫世界和平的工作是分不开来的。中国的革命成功了，工业化成功了，不仅中国的和平得到保障，远东的和平以至全世界的和平也就得到保障了。
    中国人民解放万岁！
    新民主主义成功万岁！
    世界持久和平胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
