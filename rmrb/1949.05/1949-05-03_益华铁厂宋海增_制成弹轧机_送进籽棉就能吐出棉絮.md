Jinan Telegram: Song Haizeng, manager of Linqing City's Yihua Iron Factory, has successfully trial-produced a cotton ginning and batting machine. This machine is made by combining a cotton gin and a cotton batting bow. This combined cotton ginning and batting machine saves one large wheel, one large curved shaft, one treadle board, and one hook for each machine, saving about 100 catties of raw iron and 20 catties of wrought iron, worth more than 2,000 yuan. In terms of labor, it takes 25 workers to manufacture one cotton gin and one cotton batting bow, but it now only takes 23 workers to manufacture one cotton ginning and batting machine. When in use, the machine can be started with one animal. One person feeds the seed cotton in from one end, and soft cotton fluff comes out from the other end. Compared with the original machines, it saves one animal and one person's labor and saves a lot of time. To meet the needs of this year's great production movement, in addition to manufacturing in large quantities, Manager Song is also preparing to widely introduce the manufacturing method to various places, so that it can be universally manufactured and used to improve production efficiency.

    制成弹轧机
    送进籽棉就能吐出棉絮
    【冀南电】临清市益华铁工厂经理宋海增试制弹轧机成功。该机为轧花车与弹花弓两种机器接合制成。这样结合制成的弹轧机，每架省去大轮、大弯轴、登板、挂钩各一个，可节省原料生铁一百斤、熟铁二十斤，约值两千多元。在人工上，制造一个轧花车和一架弹花弓，需二十五个工，现制造一架弹轧机，则只需二十三个工。使用时此机器套一个牲口便可开动，一人从一端将籽棉送进去，另一端即吐出松软的棉絮。比原来的机器，可省用一个牲口，一个人力。并节省很多时间。为适应今年大生产运动的需要，该厂除大量制造外，宋经理并准备将制造法向各地广泛介绍，俾能普遍制造使用，以提高生产效率。
