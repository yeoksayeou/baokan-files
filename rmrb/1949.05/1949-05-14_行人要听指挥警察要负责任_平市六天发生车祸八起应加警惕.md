    Pedestrians Must Obey Orders, Police Must Take Responsibility:
    Eight Traffic Accidents in Six Days in Beiping Call for Vigilance

    [Report from this newspaper] Traffic accidents still occur from time to time in this city. Currently, the main problems are pedestrians not following traffic rules and the police not taking responsibility. From the 8th to the 13th of this month, a total of eight traffic accidents occurred in six days. According to investigations, the causes of the accidents were mostly due to cars, streetcars, pedicabs, bicycles, and pedestrians not following traffic rules and racing against each other. For example, on the 9th, Yao Jianping, a driver from a certain regiment of the North China Military Region, was driving a truck to Xinjiekou when Zhai Bugui, riding a bicycle, suddenly crossed the car from Huguosi Road. The truck swerved to the left to avoid him, resulting in a pedicab driver on the side of the road being killed. Later, Zhang Jianwei, the political commissar of the regiment, took responsibility for handling the matter, burying the deceased and providing living expenses to the driver's family. The driver, Yao Jianping, was sent to the court to be dealt with according to the law. Furthermore, among the five traffic accidents that occurred on the 10th, three were caused by avoiding bicycles, pedicabs, and streetcars. On April 29th, a streetcar (locomotive No. 37, trailer No. 758) traveling from Qianmen to Beixinqiao was speeding. Wu Ming, the traffic police officer at that location, believed that the west entrance of Dongsi Shitiao was an important traffic artery and the road surface was narrow, making it easy for accidents to occur if vehicles traveled too fast. Therefore, he gestured for the streetcar to stop. Although the streetcar stopped, the driver got out of the car and took an iron bar to speak to the police officer, and attempted to use violence. This kind of disobedience is one of the reasons why traffic police officers do not dare to take bold responsibility. It is hoped that the leadership can implement education from both sides to correct this.

    行人要听指挥警察要负责任
    平市六天发生车祸八起应加警惕
    【本报讯】本市车祸仍不时发生，目前主要是行人不守秩序和警察没负起责任来。从本月八日至十三日，六天当中共发生车祸八起，据调查车祸的原因，多系汽车、电车、三轮车、自行车及行人不守秩序，互相抢行所致。如九日华北军区某团司机姚建萍驾驶卡车至新街口时，忽有骑自行车之翟步贵从护国寺路过该车，该车遂向左躲避，致将路边三轮车夫某方至死。后经该团政委张健伟负责处理，葬埋死者，并给予车夫家属生活费用。司机姚建萍送往法院，依法办理。又如十日所发生之五起车祸中，三次是因为躲避自行车、三轮车及电车所致。四月二十九日，有由前门开至北新桥之电车（机车三七号，拖车七五八号）行驶过速，该处交通警察吴明以东四十一条西口为交文通要道，路面狭窄，车行过速易生车祸，遂向该车作停止手势。虽然该车停止，但司机下车后却拿一铁手棒。向该警察说话，并欲动武。这种不服指挥的现象，也是交通警察不敢大胆负责的原因之一，希望领导上能从两方面实行教育，纠正。        （陈迹）
