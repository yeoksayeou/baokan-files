Taiyuan Telegram: The workers of the No. 2 Coal Mine, which has officially resumed production, truly feel "liberated," and their enthusiasm for production has doubled. While working in the coal mine, they excitedly hummed a little tune they composed themselves: "Coal carriers down the mine, have escaped the bitter sea from now on, thanks to our People's Liberation Army, truly the great savior of the people... Ai Hai Yo." On the first day, forty-two people mined eight and a half tons of coal; on the second day, sixty people mined fifteen and a half tons of coal; on the third day, the electricity was out, and it was so dark in the mine that nothing could be seen. The workers immediately proposed: "We must overcome the difficulties and not let the work stop for another day." So everyone took their sesame oil lamps into the mine, and that day they mined another eighteen tons of coal. The proportion of output increased daily over those three days, already exceeding a quarter of the average daily output during the Yan Xishan bandit regime.

    太原第二煤矿
    产量天天增加
    【太原电】正式复工生产之第二煤矿工友们真正感觉到是“解放了”，所以热情生产倍增，他们在煤窑里劳动的当儿，还兴奋的哼哼着他们自己编下的小调“下窑背煤的工友们，从此逃出苦海中，多亏我们解放军，真正是人民大救星………唉嗨哟”。第一天四十二人就开出煤八吨半，第二天六十人开出煤十五吨半；第三天电没来，窑里黑得看不见，工友们即自动提出：“我们要克服困难，决不能让工作再停息一天。”于是大家就都拿上麻油灯下窑，当天又开出煤十八吨。三天的产量比例逐日上增，已超过了阎匪统治期间常日平均产量的四分之一。
