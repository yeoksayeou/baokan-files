　　Xiaojie Village Electric Pump Restored
  　Over Ten Acres of Cotton Fields Can Be Sown in Time
    [Reported by this newspaper] Xiaojie Village in Tong County has over ten acres of dry land and is a key cotton-producing village. It uses the Tonghui River water and is equipped with pumping equipment. Every spring plowing season, the Tong County Cotton Improvement Office of the Cotton Production Improvement Office lends electric rollers and transformers to pump water for irrigation. Last spring, the Kuomintang bandit troops blocked the Tonghui River water to prevent it from flowing down in order to build fortifications, so the electric machine could not be restored, and the masses had to dibble sow, wasting a lot of labor. Moreover, the power room also collapsed due to years of disrepair, and the channels were paralyzed. After the liberation of Beiping, the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office was established and, according to the demands of the masses, restored the pumping equipment and lent a power machine to Xiaojie Village. The Tong County Cotton Ginning Factory, in coordination with the county government, dredged the river water; the troops of the ××th Unit stationed in Xiaojie Village assisted the masses in repairing the power houses and channels, which were repaired in a few days. Irrigation began on the 24th of this month. On the first day, 30 mu were irrigated, and on the second day, 50 mu were irrigated; it is estimated that more than a thousand mu of cotton fields can be irrigated by around May 10th. The masses happily said, "If the Kuomintang were still here, this spring would be dry, and we don't know how much less cotton would be planted." Some of the irrigated land has now been sown.

　　小街村电力抽水机恢复
  　十余顷棉田可及时播种
    【本报讯】通县小街村有旱田十余顷，是产棉重点村之一。利用通惠河水按装有抽水设备，每年春耕时，棉产改进处通县轧花厂借给电滚子、变压器，抽水浇地。去春国民党匪军为修筑工事，将通惠河水挡住不让流下，因而电力机不能恢复，群众只好点种，浪费很大劳力。且动力房也因多年失修倒塌，渠道瘫痪。北平解放后，华北棉产改进处成立，依据群众要求，恢复抽水设备，借予小街村动力机；通县轧花厂协同县政府将河水扒开；小街村驻军××部，协助群众整修动力房屋、渠道，数天即修好。本月二十四日已开始浇地。第一天浇地三十亩，第二天浇地五十亩；估计五月十日左右千余亩棉田即可浇完。群众高兴的说：“要是国民党还在这里，今春天旱，棉花不知少种多少。”现在浇过的地，有的已播种。
