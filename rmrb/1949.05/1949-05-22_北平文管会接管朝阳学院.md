　　Beiping Cultural Management Committee Takes Over Chaoyang College
　　[Report from this newspaper] Private Chaoyang College was unable to continue operations due to financial difficulties and was reported to and approved by the Beiping Military Control Commission for takeover. The Cultural Takeover Committee of the Beiping Military Control Commission dispatched personnel on the 20th to take over the college. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, a general meeting of all faculty, staff, and students was held. Zhang Zonglin, Director of the Education Department of the Cultural Management Committee, announced the takeover policy, expounded on the relationship between law and politics, and pointed out the bright future of the new Chaoyang under the leadership of the Judicial Department of the People's Government. He encouraged students to work hard to transform themselves, establish a revolutionary stance, viewpoint, and method, and wholeheartedly serve the people of the new China. Subsequently, Chen Shouyi, Director of the Judicial Department and an alumnus of Chaoyang, used his own experience to point out that the transformation of intellectuals is a long-term, tortuous, and continuous struggle. He encouraged students to be determined to constantly temper and transform themselves in the revolutionary struggle. Mr. Zuo Zonglun, the person in charge of the college, said very happily: "Today is the beginning of the new life of Chaoyang." He asked teachers, students, and staff to continue to study hard in the new school. Finally, representatives of the workers, students, and staff spoke successively, all expressing their determination to strengthen their studies and work hard to transform themselves. The meeting ended in the majestic singing of the "March of Democratic Youth."
