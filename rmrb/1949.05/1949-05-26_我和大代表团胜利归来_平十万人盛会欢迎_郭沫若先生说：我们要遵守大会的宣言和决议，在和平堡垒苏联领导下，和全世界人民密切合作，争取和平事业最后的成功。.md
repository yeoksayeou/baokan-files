The delegation, led by Guo Moruo and Ma Yinchu, a group of thirty-seven people, returned to Beiping today (the 25th) at 5:00 PM via special train from Shenyang through Tianjin (Deputy Head of the Delegation Liu Ningyi arrived in Beiping earlier. Representatives Qian Junrui, Lu Cui, and Wu Qing remained in Europe, while Ding Ling and Gu Yuan stayed in the Northeast). Chinese Communist Party leaders Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Li Weihan, and others, democratic figures Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Tan Pingshan, Huang Yanpei, Cai Tingkai, Ma Xulun, Mao Dun, Peng Zemin, Li Zhangda, Li Xijiu, Wu Han, Qian Duansheng, and others, representatives from various people's organizations Li Lisan, Cai Chang, Zhou Yang, Feng Wenbin, and others, as well as Beiping Mayor Ye Jianying, Commander of the Pingjin Garrison Nie Rongzhen, and more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life in Ping, went to the Beiping East Railway Station to welcome them. The delegation alighted from the train amidst melodious music. Representatives from all walks of life rushed forward to shake hands with the delegates, presented flowers, and shouted welcoming slogans. After disembarking, the delegation, accompanied by representatives from all walks of life, went to Tiananmen Square to participate in a grand welcome rally of approximately 100,000 people in Ping City. In the center of the venue, on the Tiananmen gate tower, ten large red flags fluttered. On the city wall, between the huge portraits of the people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, hung the emblem of the "World Congress of Supporters of Peace," a white dove on a green background. When the delegation arrived at the scene, the shouts of welcome and applause for the delegation's triumphant return continued for a long time. The welcome rally began with a 45-gun salute from nine cannons. First, Mayor Ye Jianying and Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Ping City Federation of Trade Unions, delivered speeches on behalf of the people and people's organizations of Beiping, welcoming the delegation's victorious return to the country and celebrating the great success of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.

Subsequently, Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, Ma Yinchu, deputy head of the delegation, and representatives Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Li Dequan, and Xiao San spoke.

Guo Moruo spoke amidst thunderous applause and cheers. He said: "Our ability to return victoriously this time is thanks to the wise people's leader Chairman Mao, the heroic People's Liberation Army, and the compatriots in the fully liberated areas who worked hard to produce and support the front lines. All victories and glory belong to the people and to the people's leader Chairman Mao." He then described the great encouragement that the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War gave to the Peace Congress. He said: "The people of the world regard China's victory as their own victory, as an important factor in striving for world peace." He went on to introduce the great peaceful construction of the Soviet Union seen by the delegation during its passage through the peace fortress of the Soviet Union, as well as the grand celebrations of the Soviet Union's "May Day" Labor Day. Finally, he said: "Our major work is still ahead. We must abide by the declaration and resolutions of the congress, under the leadership of the peace fortress, the Soviet Union, use the strength of the entire Chinese people to cooperate closely with the people of the world, and strive for the final success of the cause of peace."

Ma Yinchu, deputy head of the delegation, said in his speech that the congress fully proved the great victory of the Chinese Liberation War and its significant contribution to world peace, especially giving great encouragement to the nations that are fighting against imperialism and reactionaries in various countries today, giving them increased courage and confidence. He introduced the warm welcome of the people of the world to our delegation and their heartfelt love for the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao. An African representative once said: "Chairman Mao is not only the savior of the Chinese people, but also the savior of the African people."

Zhang Xiruo emphasized in his speech that this congress was a demonstration against the imperialist warmongers, and the people of the world demonstrated unprecedented unity and great strength. The success of the congress is a preliminary success, and we must gradually implement the resolutions of the congress and promote the organization for defending peace throughout China.

Xu Deheng described in his speech that during the Peace Delegation's visit abroad, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War brought the delegation unparalleled honor and made China's international status unprecedentedly higher. He explained the consistency between striving for world peace and our people's liberation war, and that without the realization of true peace in China, there would be no guarantee of peace in the Far East. Therefore, in order to strive for lasting world peace, the revolutionary war in China must be carried through to the end.

Li Dequan said in her speech that she was pleased and admired by the heroic struggles of the sisters of the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries and colonial countries for our women.

Xiao San explained in his speech that the Peace Congress decided to establish a permanent committee to mobilize and unite all peace forces to defend world peace, and the Chinese people should fight for world peace under the leadership of the permanent committee.

Finally, the audience shouted slogans and the meeting adjourned at eight o'clock.

    【新华社北平二十五日电】北平市工人、学生、各界市民及卫戍北平的人民解放军约十万人热烈欢迎出席世界拥护和平大会胜利归国的中国代表团。代表团郭沫若、马寅初等一行三十七人，于本日（二十五日）下午五时由沈阳乘专车经天津返抵北平（代表团副团长刘宁一已于日前先期抵平，代表钱俊瑞、陆璀、吴青留欧洲，丁玲、古元留东北）。中国共产党负责人周恩来、林伯渠、董必武、李维汉等，民主人士李济深、沈钧儒、谭平山、黄炎培、蔡廷错、马叙伦、茅盾、彭泽民、李章达、李锡九、吴晗、钱端升等，各人民团体代表李立三、蔡畅、周扬、冯文彬等及北平市叶剑英市长、平津卫戍司令部聂荣臻司令员暨平市各界人民代表二千余人，前往北平东车站欢迎。代表团在悠扬的音乐声中下车。各界人民代表纷纷趋前与代表团各位代表握手，向代表团献花，并高呼欢迎口号。代表团下车后，即由各界人民代表陪同前往天安门，参加平市约十万群众的盛大欢迎会。会场正中、天安门的城楼上飘扬着十面大红旗。城墙上，在人民领袖毛主席、朱总司令的巨像之间，悬着“世界拥护和平大会”的绿底白鸽的会徽。当代表团莅场时，欢迎代表团胜利归来的口号声与掌声经久不息。欢迎大会在九门大炮齐发四十五响的礼炮声中开始。首由叶剑英市长及平市职工会筹备会主任萧明代表北平人民和人民团体致词，欢迎代表团胜利回国，并庆祝世界拥护和平大会的伟大成功。
    继由代表团团长郭沫若、副团长马寅初及代表张奚若、许德珩、李德全、萧三等讲话。
    郭沫若在雷动的掌声和欢呼中讲话。他说：我们这次能胜利归来，是英明的人民领袖毛主席，英勇作战的人民解放军，和努力生产支援前线的全解放区的同胞给予我们的，一切的胜利和光荣，属于人民和属于人民领袖毛主席。接着他叙述了中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利所给予和平大会的极大鼓励，他说：全世界的人民把中国的胜利当成自己的胜利，当成争取世界和平的重要因素，他继又介绍了代表团此次途经和平堡垒苏联时所见苏联的伟大的和平建设以及参加苏联“五一”劳动节的盛况。最后他说：我们的重大工作还在后面，我们要遵守大会的宣言和决议，在和平堡垒苏联领导下，用全中国人民的力量来和全世界人民密切合作，争取和平事业最后的成功。
    代表团副团长马寅初在讲话中说，在这次大会上，充分证明了中国解放战争的伟大胜利，对于世界和平的重大贡献，特别是予今天正在与帝国主义和各国反动派战斗的各民族以极大的鼓励，给予他们增加了无限的勇气和信心。他介绍了世界人民对我国代表的热烈欢迎及对中国人民领袖毛主席衷心爱戴的情形，曾经有位非洲代表说：毛主席不仅是中国人民的救星，而且是非洲人民的救星。

    许德珩讲话时叙述了和平代表团出国期间，中国人民解放战争的胜利使代表团受到了无比的荣誉，使中国人民的国际地位空前提高。他说明争取世界和平与我国人民解放战争的一致性，中国真正的和平如不能实现，远东的和平就没有保障。因此为了争取世界的持久和平，必须把中国的革命战争进行到底。
    李德全在讲话中叙述了苏联与各新民主国家、各殖民地国家的妇女姊妹们对我国妇女的英勇奋斗，表示欣慰和敬佩。
    萧三在讲话中说明和平大会决定成立永久委员会，以动员及联合一切和平的力量，来保卫世界和平，中国人民应在永久委员会领导下为全世界的和平而奋斗。
