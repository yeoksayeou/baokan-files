　　Visiting the Baoding Power Plant

　　[News from Central Hebei] The Baoding Power Plant, standing on the north bank of the Fuhe River outside the South Gate of Baoding, resumed daytime power generation on April 13th, enabling sixty electric machine industries in Baoding to resume daytime production. When the reporter entered the power plant and saw the workers intently watching the load on the electricity meter, busily wiping the machines, installing the broken glass windows damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops, and repairing the corrugated iron sheets on the roof, that kind of joyful scene made it hard to imagine that they were still suffering and languishing under the various persecutions and oppressions of the Kuomintang not long ago, even to the point of unemployment. At that time, in the factory, they used slowdowns and sabotage as a response to the Kuomintang rulers. While working, one person watched the machine, and the rest dozed off.

　　Last year, on the night of the thirteenth day of the tenth lunar month, when the People's Liberation Army fought in, seven veteran workers, including Wang Jinsheng and Feng Guangming, braved the fierce artillery fire to guard the machines and nailed the doors and windows of the power plant with wooden boards. They said, "As long as the machines are safely handed over to the People's Liberation Army, we will have food and happiness." The day after the liberation of Baoding, under the mobilization and organization of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the workers put down their persimmon poles and handcarts (which they used to make a living after being unemployed) and returned to the power plant. Liberation, like a stimulant, gave them infinite vitality. In just thirteen days, they repaired the water pipes, water tanks, and lines, allowing Baoding, which had been in darkness for three months, to shine brightly again. In the boiler room, where coal dust flew, the workers picked up the burnt coal kernels and mixed them into the coal pile to burn again, which could save 400 catties of good coal per night. In order to save coal, they also studied how to make the air gate smaller to maintain the boiler's temperature; in order to protect the machines, they added more lead powder to the boiler to prevent rust. Once, a strong vibration sound was emitted from the steam turbine. Worker Feng Guangming, based on past experience, knew that some "turbine" blades had fallen off. He immediately stopped the machine and ran over. Worker Wang Jinsheng, seeing the lights go out at home, immediately ran back to the factory. The two of them busily ran up and lifted the 2,000-jin heavy steam turbine cover with a manual crane, then knocked off the broken "turbine" blades one by one, and replaced them with new ones one by one. In this way, they worked from five o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon without showing any signs of fatigue. The workers were infinitely concerned about the future of their factory. They suggested to the factory that electricity be supplied during the day. Their calculation was: if electricity is only supplied at night, there will be fewer users and the electricity price will be expensive. If electricity can be supplied during the day, firstly, it can drive the production of electric machine industries; secondly, with more electricity consumption, the cost of electricity can be reduced, and the electricity price can also be reduced accordingly. After daytime power generation, the electricity price dropped from six catties of rice per unit for ordinary households and five catties of rice for industrial households in March to four and a half catties and three and a half catties, respectively. The output of various factories using electricity has generally increased. The Fuhegong Flour Company has more than doubled its output compared to before, and the Baoji Oil Press has increased from pressing 8,000 catties of seeds per day to 12,000 catties.

　　Why are the workers so concerned about the future of the power plant? It's very simple, because the development of the factory is already linked to their own interests. The factory's labor insurance regulations have also begun to be implemented. If a worker is injured at work, the factory is responsible for treatment and continues to pay wages; in the event of death, in addition to all funeral expenses being borne by the factory, 60% of the original wage will be paid for three years. Disability and old age both have pensions and relief funds. In terms of other equipment, there are also masks, work clothes, and bathhouses, etc., and a cooperative has been organized to supply employees with daily necessities at prices lower than the market price. They are very clear that their lives will be improved day by day with the restoration and development of the factory. When saying goodbye, the workers pulled the reporter to see the three intact generators with capacities of 1,000, 300, and 170 kilowatts parked in the north and south rooms. They smiled and said to me, "If Baoding quickly establishes industry, we will start them all up."

　　访问保定发电厂
    【冀中讯】耸立在保定南关外府河北岸的保定发电厂，从四月十三日恢复白天发电。使保定市六十家电力机器工业恢复了白天生产。当记者走进发电厂，看到职工们注目凝视着电力表的负荷轻重，紧张忙碌的擦机器，装置被国民党匪军打破的玻璃窗，修理房顶上的洋铁板那种愉快的情景时，你很难想到他们在不久以前还是在国民党的各种迫害压榨中痛苦熬煎，以至失业。那时在厂里他们用怠工和破坏作为对国民党统治者的回答，工作时，一个人看着机器，其余的便打盹。
    去年旧历十月十三日夜间解放军打进来时，王金生、冯光明等七位老工人，冒着猛烈的炮火去守护机器，用木板钉死了发电厂的门窗，他们说：“只要把机器安全的交到解放军手里，饭碗、幸福就会有了。”保定解放的第二天，在共产党和人民政府的发动组织下，工人们放下柿挑和排子车（失业后以此为业）又回到发电厂。解放，象强心剂一样，使他们增加了无限活力，短短十三天，他们修好了蓄水管、水箱线路使黑暗三个月的保定重放光明。在煤层飞扬的锅炉房，工人们拣起烧过的煤核，把它掺到煤堆里再烧一遍，这样一晚上就可节省四百斤好煤。为了节省煤他们又研究了使风闸口小些，保持锅炉热度；为了爱护机器，在锅炉里多上铅粉，以免生锈。有一次，从透手机内发出一种强烈的震荡声，工人冯光明根据以往的经验，知道有的“托尔宾”叶子掉下来了，他马上停车跑去，工人王金生在家里见到电灯熄了，就马上跑回工厂，两个人极忙的跑上去，把二千斤重的手透机梯用人力起重机拉起，然后把坏了的“托尔宾”叶子，用铁链一个一个的打掉，再一个一个的换上新的，就这样，从早上五点钟工作到下午四点钟，一点也不显得疲备。工人们无限关心自己工厂的前途，他们向厂方提出了白天送电的建议，他们的计算是：只夜间送电，使用户少，电价贵，若能白天送电，一来可以带动起电力机器工业生产；二来用电量多了，电的成本即可减低，电价也可随之减低。白天发电后使电价从三月份的普通户的每码六斤米，工业户五斤米降到四斤半和三斤半，利用电力的各工厂产量都普遍增加。福和公面粉公司，产量较前增加一倍，保记榨油厂，已由每日榨籽八千斤增到一万二千斤。
    工人们为什么这样关心电厂的前途呢？很简单，因为工厂的发展和他们的切身利益已经联结起来。现工厂的劳动保险条例也已开始实行。工人因工致伤厂方负责治疗，并照发工资；死亡的，除一切葬费由厂方负责外，并按其工资原额之十分六照发三年，残废与年老均有养老与抚恤金。其他设备上，也有了口罩、工作服、和澡塘等，并已组织合作社低于市价供给职工日常必需品。他们非常清楚，他们的生活会随着工厂的恢复发展，而日益改善的。告别时，工友们拉着记者看南北两个房间停放着的一千、三百、和一百七十基罗瓦特的三个完好无损的发电机，他们笑着向我说：“要是保定很快的建立起工业，我们就把它全部开动起来。”
