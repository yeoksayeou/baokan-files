　　Ping City Public Factory Trade Union Cadre Meeting
  　Inspecting the Implementation of the Four Major Tasks
    Implementing Democratic Management and Improving Production
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of cadres from trade unions of various public factories yesterday morning (the 19th). Over 70 people, representing more than 30 units, attended and inspected the progress of the implementation of democratic factory management and the organization of factory management committees in various factories. Since the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed the Four Major Tasks for factory construction (namely, formulating a one-year production plan, establishing a factory management committee, factory security, and employee education) on April 28th, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions coordinated and arranged this work for the trade unions of various factories. In order to promptly develop and solve problems in the work, four working groups were organized to conduct inspections in thirteen factories in the city. As of the 13th, the inspection revealed that the following eight factories had not yet started organizing a factory management committee: 70th Ordnance Factory, People's Printing Factory, 409th Automobile Repair Factory, Trolleybus Company, and North China Electric Power Company. The Telecommunications Bureau was studying implementation. The following four units had either started to establish or had formally established a factory management committee: Water Company, North China Highway Bureau, and the Road Roller Factory affiliated with the Construction Bureau.
    In the process of carrying out this work, some trade union cadres have not yet recognized that the establishment of a factory management committee is to mobilize employees to consciously manage the factory and develop production. Instead, they emphasize some difficulties that can be overcome. For example, some factories believe that most of the worker activists have been transferred to training classes, thus reducing confidence in the work. Some raised that the personnel and organizational structure of the factory have not yet been adjusted, the factory's affiliation is not yet clear, and individual departures and retentions have not yet been determined. Some administrative leaders believe that all past work has been carried out through democratic discussion, so the factory management committee is unnecessary or can be delayed. An even more serious phenomenon is that no publicity was carried out among the workers after the meeting, and even the cadres of most factories did not convey or discuss it. Although individual factories have conducted research, the opinions of the administration and the trade union have not been unified. Therefore, some workers have doubts about the news in the newspaper calling for the establishment of a factory management committee. Although some factories have started to establish a factory management committee, the methods are not cautious enough. For example, the worker representatives on the factory management committee of the North China Highway Bureau were not elected by the workers but were designated by the trade union and the administration. As a result, the workers felt that this organization had nothing to do with them. Worker representatives accounted for only two of the seven members of the Road Roller Factory's factory management committee, accounting for only one-third of the representative seats. (According to regulations, the number of worker representatives should be twice the total number of other committee members.)
    Comrade Zhang Hongshun of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions analyzed and criticized each of the situations based on his understanding. The trade unions are basically pure, which provides the basic conditions for the democratic management of factories. The failure to adjust the personnel structure cannot be used as a reason for not implementing the above work, but should be combined with the implementation. The undetermined affiliation and individual departures and retentions cannot be a reason either, because democratic management must be implemented in the factory regardless of which system it belongs to or who is working there. Organizing a factory management committee is to launch a democratic movement, and worker activists emerge from the movement. The past activists were transferred to study, and a new batch of activists will emerge in the future. Therefore, it is also wrong to reduce confidence in the work because there are no worker activists.
    During the meeting, Comrade Zhang Hongshun also reviewed the leadership of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. He pointed out: "The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions must also bear great responsibility for not doing this work well. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions only provided leadership of a calling nature for the implementation of democratic factory management work. Although working groups were sent out, they did not solve many problems. The problems raised by various factories were not resolved in a timely manner, especially the leadership of the factories in the suburban areas of the city was relaxed. In addition, the division of labor among the leaders within the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is not clear. No one can understand the overall situation. When there is work, everyone grabs a handful, and the difficulties raised by the lower levels cannot be resolved in a timely manner, resulting in more or less a disconnection between the upper and lower levels." Finally, the meeting decided on the following steps for implementing democratic factory management and organizing factory management committees in the future: (1) After the meeting, each factory will carry out a widespread and diverse publicity campaign for seven to ten days. On the other hand, workers and leaders, trade unions and administrations should launch a mutual criticism and self-criticism campaign, the purpose of which is to make workers truly realize that they have become the masters of the factory today. (2) Before and after the end of the publicity campaign, the conditions for representatives should be discussed among the workers, and the objects of representatives should be incubated. Representatives who can truly represent the interests of the workers should be elected to attend the factory management committee of the factory. Before the representatives are produced, a representative election campaign should be launched, and then a general election by the workers or by the workers' representative meeting should be held.

　　平市公营工厂职工会干部会议
  　检查四大任务执行情形
    贯彻管理民主化提高生产
    【本报讯】北平市总工会筹备会昨日（十九日）上午召集各公营工厂职工会干部会议，到七十余人，代表三十余单位，检查了各厂执行工厂管理民主化，组织工厂管理委员会工作进行情形。自四月二十八日中共北平市委会向各厂提出建厂的四大任务（即制定一年生产计划、成立工厂管理委员会、工厂保卫和职工教育工作）后，市总工会筹备会即配合向各厂职工会布置了这一工作。并为及时发展与解决工作中的问题起见，又组织了四个工作组，在市内十三个工厂中分别进行了检查。截至十三日止，检查出根本未着手进行组织工厂管理委员会者计有：七十兵工厂、人民印刷厂、四零九汽车修理厂、电车公司及华北电业公司等八个工厂；已在研究执行者有电讯局；已着手建立或已正式建立者计有自来水公司、华北公路局、建设局所属之车碾厂等四个单位。
    在进行这一工作中，某些职工会干部还没有认识成立工厂管理委员会就是发动职工自觉的起来管理工厂发展生产，而强调一些可以克服的困难，如有的工厂认为大部工人积极分子已调训练班学习，因而减低工作信心；有的提出工厂人事、机构尚未进行调整，工厂隶属尚不明确，个人去留尚未确定；也有的行政负责同志认为过去一切工作都是经过民主讨论进行，工厂管理委员会就可不必成立或者拖延一下没什么关系。而更为严重的现象则是会后根本没向工人进行宣传，大部厂连在干部中间也未传达和讨论。个别厂虽然做了研究，但行政和职工会意见并未统一起来，因此有的工人对报纸上号召成立工厂管理委员会的消息发生怀疑态度。有的工厂虽然已着手建立，但方式也不够慎重，如华北公路局工厂管理委员会的工人代表不是工人选举而是由工会和行政上指定的，结果工人觉得此一组织与他们没什么关系。车碾厂工厂管理委员会七个委员，工人代表只占两名，代表名额仅三分之一。（按工人代表应为其他委员总数的一倍）
    市职工总会张鸿舜同志根据所了解的情况逐一分析和批判。职工会基本上是纯洁的，这就具备了民主管理工厂的基本条件，至于人事机构未调整不能当做不能执行以上工作之理由，而应结合进行。隶属关系未确定及个人去留更不能成为理由，因为工厂无论属哪一系统，无论什么人在工作都要实行民主管理。组织工厂管理委员会，是要发起一个民主运动，工人积极分子都是从运动中涌现出来的，过去的积极分子调去学习，今后还要出现一批新积极分子。因此，认为没有工人积极分子而减低工作信心也是错误的。
    会议中，张鸿舜同志对市总工会筹备会本身领导上也做了检查，他指出：“这一段工作没做好，总工会领导上也要负很大责任。总工会对执行工厂民主管理工作，只是号召性质的领导，虽经派出工作组也未解决很大问题。对各厂所提问题迟迟不加解决，尤其是对市郊区工厂更是放松了领导。另外在总工会内部领导分工不明确，没有一个人能了解全面情况，有了工作相互抓一把，不能及时解决下层所提困难问题，以致目前或多或少产生上下脱节现象。”最后，会上决定了今后实行工厂民主管理，组织工厂管理委员会的步骤：（一）会后七天至十天时间，各工厂普遍进行广泛的多样方式的宣传运动。另一方面各厂工人与领导之间，工会与行政之间要开展一个相互批评与自我批评运动，目的是使工人真正认识到今天已成为工厂的主人翁了。（二）宣传运动结束前后，在工人中间要讨论代表条件，酝酿代表对象，要选出真正能代表工人利益的代表，出席本厂的工厂管理委员会。在代表未产生之前，要发起代表竞选运动，然后由工人普遍选举，或由工人代表会产生。（本报记者柏青）
