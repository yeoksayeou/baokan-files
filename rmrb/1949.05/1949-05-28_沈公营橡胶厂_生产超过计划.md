　　Shen Public-Operated Rubber Factory
  　Production Exceeds Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] The six public-operated rubber factories in Shenyang have exceeded their first six-month production plan since liberation. Currently, each factory is strengthening its management practices on the existing basis to improve product quality. In the six months from Shenyang's liberation in November last year to April this year, the rubber factories' production of automobile inner tubes exceeded the original plan by 11%, and V-belts exceeded the plan by 72%. Other products, such as rubber shoes and rickshaw tires, have also met or exceeded their plans. Some rubber products have even exceeded the highest output during the Kuomintang rule. For example, the highest monthly output of automobile inner tubes during the Kuomintang rule was 150, while the monthly output after liberation was 926 in March and reached more than 1,600 in April. Although the factories have achieved significant results in resuming production, building factories, and increasing output in the past six months, they have not paid enough attention to improving quality, and the economic accounting system is not sound, resulting in a waste of manpower and materials. The Rubber Company, under the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government Committee, is now formulating preliminary standards for product quality and cost based on the past production of each factory to gradually rationalize production.

　　沈公营橡胶厂
  　生产超过计划
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】沈阳市六个公营橡胶工厂，已超过解放后的第一个半年生产计划。目前各厂正在现有基础上，加强管理工作，以提高产品质量。从去年十一月沈阳解放到今年四月的六个月中，橡胶工厂的汽车内胎生产超过原订计划的百分之十一，三角皮带超过计划百分之七十二；其他如胶鞋、人力车胎等各种产品，也完成或超过计划。有些橡胶产品并已超过国民党统治时期的最高产量。如汽车内胎，国民党统治时每月最高产量是一百五十只，而解放后的月产量三月份是九百二十六只，四月份则达到一千六百余只。半年中各厂虽在复工建厂和提高产量方面，已获显著成绩。但对提高质量注意不够，经济核算制度亦不健全，以致造成若干人力物力的浪费。现东北政委会工业部所属的橡胶公司刻正根据过去各厂生产情况。着手订定产品质量和成本的初步标准，以逐渐使生产合理化。
