    The People of Taiyuan Thank Our Army
    Sewing and Mending Clothes in Enthusiastic Support
    [Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan Military Control Commission, in order to commend the merits of the People's Liberation Army, specially extracted a large amount of white flour, cigarettes, shirts, towels, socks, white sugar, kelp, milk powder, etc. from the seized materials and distributed them to various army corps and garrison troops. The citizens also initiated enthusiastic support. On May 4th alone, the Military Control Commission received more than a hundred letters of condolence, filled with infinite gratitude to the People's Liberation Army. The residents of Shangma Street wrote: "The People's Liberation Army, saving us from misery, today the hundreds of thousands of people of Taiyuan City have escaped from the sea of suffering. This is your achievement. We congratulate the Communist Party. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Liberation Army!" On the day of the liberation of Taiyuan, workers, peasants, and students in the suburbs of the city launched a wave of support for the army. Teachers and students of Xincheng Village Elementary School raised condolences on the streets, and women competed to sew and mend clothes and socks for the soldiers. On May 4th, when the Northeast Artillery Corps left Taiyuan to march south, Ma Paiying and six other family members of workers worked through the night to make condolence bags the day before. Residents of Shouyi Street and Qiaotou Street, holding red flags, beating drums, and holding flowers in their hands, lined up on both sides of the road to cheer and send them off. As the artillery passed, a citizen said: They are truly strong men, strong horses, and have good weapons. Wherever Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan flee, there is no worry that they will not be captured.

    太原人民感谢我军
    缝衣补袜热烈劳军
    【太原电】太原军管会为慰劳人民解放军的功劳，特从缴获物资中抽出大批白面、纸烟、衬衣、毛巾、袜子、白糖、海带、牛乳等分送各兵团及警备部队。市民亦纷纷发起慰劳、仅五月四日一天内军管会即收到慰问信百余件，信内洋溢着对解放军的无限感激之情，上马街的居民写着：“救苦救难的解放军，今日太原市几十万人民脱离苦海，这是你们的功劳，我们祝贺共产党，毛主席万岁，人民解放军万岁。”解放太原的当天，城郊的工人，农民，学生掀起了劳军热潮，新城村小学师生们在街上募集慰劳品，妇女们争着给战士缝补衣服和袜子。五月四日当东北炮兵南征离开太原时，工人家属马排英等七人在前一天夜里连夜赶制了慰问袋，首义街桥头街的居民，打着红旗，敲着鼓，手里捧着花，于行道两旁整队欢送。当炮兵走过时，一个市民说：真是人强马壮武器好，蒋介石阎锡山逃到那里不愁捉拿不住。
