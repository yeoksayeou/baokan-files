　　发扬秋毫无犯优良传统
  　严守入城纪律
  　第四野战军通令全军遵行
    【新华社汉口二十三日电】人民解放军第四野战军司令部政治部为严格部队入城纪律，在部队进驻武汉前曾发出通令，号召全军在今后解放江南各省城市时，应发扬本军进入平津时秋毫无犯的优良传统，切实遵守人民解放军总部颁布的三大纪律、八项注意、约法八章与入城守则，保护城市，以等待军管会接收。通令中并指示所属部队入城时必须遵守的事项，其重要者为：
    （一）军队必须保护城市人民的生命财产，不许侵犯。除现行犯外，各机关部队不得擅自捕人。凡属遵守人民政府法令的外侨，一律予以保护，其有违反或破坏行为者，应报告上级及军管会处理，不得自行处理。
    （二）为爱护群众利益。密切军民关系，部队在城市驻军时，禁止借住或租住民房，以免引起城市居民的不便和不利；而应驻札在兵营、公共机关、庙宇、祠堂、公所或会馆等场所。军人假日看戏、理发、洗澡、游览公共娱乐场所及乘坐电车或公共汽车者，均须照章购票，照价付钱，不得要求免票或减价。部队担任警戒时，须认真执行职务，但对群众态度要和蔼，不得蛮横无理。
    （三）为保护城市建设，军队对公共房屋建筑及家具设备不得移走、拆毁或破坏。军队的骡马大车不宜入城，其必须运送物资、弹药、粮食入城者，在装卸完毕后，应即行出城，禁止在市区饲养。禁止在市内树上拴马，以保护对木。驻在城市部队应以师或团为单位在城外组织马厩，饲养牲口。
    （四）为保持部队的朴素作风，没有经过上级许可，不得接受人民的慰劳或邀请吃饭赴宴。
    （五）为整顿军风纪，维持城市秩序，部队必须整顿军容，提倡礼节。关于市内卫戍勤务、执行军风纪、交通规则、娱乐场所规则及公共卫生等，军队人员必须服从当地军管会、警备司令部及公安局之指挥，遵守规定。军队应组织营房的文化娱乐活动，严格执行请假制度，不准上街游逛。无故不许鸣枪，如需举行军事演习和试枪者，应由警备司令部批准，并事先通知当地民众，在市郊举行。
