Jinzhong Vigorously Organizes Reseeding to Fight Against Hail and Frost Disasters
[Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] Most areas of Jinzhong have suffered from hail and frost disasters. The Taiyuan Municipal Government has urgently instructed all affected special districts and counties to immediately organize the masses to vigorously carry out reseeding. From the night of the 11th to the 14th of this month, except for most counties in the mountainous areas of the First Special District where it rained two to three inches, parts of thirteen counties in the Second and Third Special Districts suffered from hail and frost disasters. In Wenxi and Jiaocheng counties of the Second Special District, hailstones of about two inches in diameter fell for as long as one hour and twenty minutes. The hailstones were as large as apricot kernels and as small as soybeans. Rice seedlings in Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Xugou, Jinyuan, and other counties were also frozen at the same time, with cotton suffering the most severe damage. For example, in Wenxi County, 60,000 mu of cotton that had been sown was damaged by frost by 70 to 80 percent. Yuci, Qixian, Taigu, Pingyao, and Jiexiu counties in the Third Special District also suffered frost disasters one after another. Irrigated land was even more severely affected. The production morale of some of the masses has been affected. According to the disaster situation in various places, the Taiyuan Municipal Government has urgently instructed all affected special districts and counties to fully strengthen the leadership of disaster relief and production. Those who have the conditions to reseed all cash crops should quickly reseed; those who do not have the conditions should also reseed or switch to other crops to ensure that no land is left vacant. Currently, the masses in the disaster-stricken areas of various counties in the Third Special District are reseeding cotton, sorghum, and other early-maturing crops. The masses in the disaster-stricken areas of Fenyang County are taking out the seeds that they had prepared long ago for reseeding. Everyone said, "We have been prepared for this for years. Now that Taiyuan has also been captured, good days are ahead!"
