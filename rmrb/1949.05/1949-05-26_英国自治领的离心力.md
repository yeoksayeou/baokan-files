    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The Labour Newspaper published an article in Moscow on the 21st entitled "Centrifugal Force in the British Dominions." The author wrote: Not long ago, the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held in London. The hasty convocation of this conference was due to the fear of the strengthening of centrifugal forces. The national liberation movement in the colonies is a factor that damages and shakes the imperialist rule of colonies and dependencies. The influence of centrifugal force can be felt not only in the colonies of the British Empire, but also in the dominions. If we pay attention to the stagnation of economic development in the British mainland, we will see the changes in the mutual strength between the "British Commonwealth" mainland and the dominions. The competition between them is becoming more acute. Before the war, the industrial production of the United Kingdom was three times greater than that of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa. But by 1947, the industrial production of these countries had reached more than half of that of the United Kingdom. American monopoly capitalists, taking advantage of the weakened position of their British partners in the world, have declared themselves the "natural heirs" of the British Empire. A large amount of American capital poured into British dominions and colonies. The slogan of American monopoly capital regarding the larger-scale use of American capital to "develop backward areas" is a signal to launch a new offensive against the British Empire's markets and raw material resources.
    The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference ostensibly discussed the issue of new constitutional changes, but in reality, the focus of the London conference was on formulating plans to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia and to form a certain Pacific Pact for this purpose. In addition to the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, this pact will include India, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The Pacific Pact is intended as a direct supplement and extension to the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. The significance of the decisions at the London conference lies in the fact that the bourgeois nationalist group in India has agreed to turn the country into a political, military, and economic base for the US-British bloc, and a bridgehead for suppressing the national liberation movements of various Asian nations.
    However, there is a great distance between the colonialists' plans and the possibility of realizing them. The new tricks of British imperialism and its Indian servants have aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the Indian people. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India stated that capitalists, landlords, chieftains, and princes are undoubtedly elated by this betrayal of the Indian people. But the Indian working class and laboring people will never abandon their position in their common anti-imperialist liberation movement. The growth of democratic and progressive forces will be seen in the British dominions.
    The leaders of the British Labour Party are trying their best to collude with the reactionary groups in the colonies and dependencies, attempting in this way to strengthen the "unity of the Empire" on the basis of aggression and reactionary policies. But this foundation is extremely unstable, and it makes the centrifugal force of the British Empire even stronger.

    英国自治领的离心力
    （劳动报）
    【新华社北平二十四日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报二十一日发表列明的论文，题为“英国自治领的离心力”。作者写道：不久以前伦敦举行了大英联邦总理会议，这次会议的匆促召开是由于害怕离心力的加强。殖民地的民族解放运动，是破坏与动摇帝国主义统治殖民地与附属国的因素。离心力的影响不仅在英帝国的殖民地可以感到，而且在自治领中也是一样。如果注意一下英国本土经济发展的停滞，我们就会看到“大英联邦”本土与自治领间相互力量的变化。它们之间的竞争是更形尖锐了。英国战前的工业生产量要比加拿大、澳洲、新西兰和南非联邦的工业生产大三倍。但到一九四七年，这些国家的工业生产已经达到英国工业生产的一半以上。美国垄断资本家利用他们的英国伙友在世界上被削弱了的地位，宣告他们自己是英帝国“天生的继承人”。大批的美国资本涌入英国自治领和殖民地。美国垄断资本关于更大规模的运用美国资本“发展落后地区”的口号，就是向英帝国市场和原料资源发动新攻势的信号。
    大英联邦总理会议表面上说是讨论新的宪法变更问题，但是实际上，伦敦会议的重点是在制订镇压亚洲民族解放运动的计划，并为此结成某种太平洋公约，这个公约除了美、英、法、荷之外，将要包括印度、缅甸、泰国、越南和菲律宾。太平洋公约是用来作为侵略的北大西洋公约的直接补充与延伸的。伦敦会议上的决定，其意义在于印度的资产阶级民族主义集团同意把国家变成美英集团的政治、军事与经济基地，变成镇压亚洲各民族民族解放运动的桥头阵地。
    然而，在殖民主义者的计划和实现他们计划的可能性之间是存在着极大的距离的。英帝国主义和它的印度从仆们的新花样，引起了广大的印度人民群众的愤慨。印度共产党中央委员会声明指出：资本家、地主、土酋和王公们无疑地因为这样出卖印度人民而得意洋洋。但是印度工人阶级和劳动人民决不会在他们的共同反帝国主义解放运动中放弃他们的地位。在英国各自治领中将看到民主进步力量的生长。
    英国工党领袖竭力与殖民地和附属国的反动集团私下勾结，企图这样来在侵略与反动政策的基础上加强“帝国的统一”。但是这个基础是极不稳定的，它使得英帝国离心力更趋强烈。
