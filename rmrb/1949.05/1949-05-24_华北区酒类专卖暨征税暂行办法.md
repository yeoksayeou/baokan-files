    Formulated by the North China People's Government
    Promulgated on May 20, 38th Year of the Republic of China
    Chapter I General Principles
    Article 1 All liquor in this region shall be under government monopoly. The production, manufacture, sales, and taxation shall be managed by the North China Tax Bureau in accordance with the provisions of these measures.
    Article 2 The term "liquor" as used in these measures includes the following five categories:
    1. Baijiu (white liquor)
    2. Huangjiu (yellow liquor) (including Shaoxing wine, imitation Shaoxing wine, and local yellow liquor)
    3. Alcohol (both toxic and non-toxic)
    4. Foreign wine and beer (including draft beer, pasteurized beer, and other liquor made in imitation of foreign products)
    5. Fruit wine, medicinal liquor, and various modified liquors
    Article 3 Private brewing shall only be temporarily permitted under special circumstances and with special permission:
    1. Fruit wine brewed periodically and in fixed quantities within two months after autumn in areas with a high concentration of special products such as dates, persimmons, and pears.
    2. Famous local wines and existing brewing industries in newly liberated areas.
    Article 4 Private liquor from neighboring regions is temporarily prohibited from entering this region. Public liquor shall, in principle, not be imported reciprocally. If there is a special agreement for entry, it shall be handed over to the monopoly organ of this region for acquisition at a negotiated price.
    Article 5 Liquor from non-liberated areas is strictly prohibited from being imported. For old stocks of liquor in newly liberated areas, registration and tax payment shall be completed within a limited time, and they shall be handed over to the monopoly organ or designated sales area for sale within a limited time.
    Chapter II Registration
    Article 6 All specially permitted private liquor businesses (referring to fruit wine) and modified liquor businesses, as well as yeast-making businesses, shall apply for registration with the local tax authority one month before commencing business (those already in operation shall report retroactively). They may only commence or continue business after being examined, approved, and issued a permit, and shall complete the following registration items:
    1. Factory (shop) name
    2. Address
    3. Name of the responsible person
    4. Nature of organization and total capital
    5. Equipment
    6. Production plan
    7. Product name and type
    8. Trademark design
    Registration forms and content shall be separately stipulated by the North China Tax Bureau.
    Article 7 If a registered liquor merchant changes any of the registration items in the preceding article, they shall report to the original registration tax authority in advance. Those who apply for closure and are approved shall, in addition to surrendering the permit, have the vats and stoves sealed.
    Article 8 Yeast-making businesses shall record in detail the quantity of raw materials, finished products, production, sales, and storage in a register and report it to the local tax authority on a regular basis. Whether public or private liquor factories or other brewing businesses purchase yeast, they shall issue a certificate for inspection.
    Chapter III Tax Rates
    Article 9 Liquor tax rates:
    1. Baijiu: 80% ad valorem
    2. Huangjiu: 80% ad valorem
    3. Alcohol: 80% ad valorem (tax exemption may be granted if it is proven to be for industrial or medicinal purposes)
    4. Foreign wine, beer, modified liquor, and liquor stored in liberated areas that originated from non-liberated areas: 100% ad valorem
    5. Fruit wine: 50% ad valorem
    Article 10 The liquor tax on modified liquor shall be levied on the increased value. The tax payable shall be calculated by deducting the tax paid on the raw material liquor from the current tax amount. The number of catties of raw material liquor, the tax certificate number, and the amount of the originally paid tax shall be indicated in the remarks column of the tax certificate.
    Article 11 The average wholesale price from the 1st to the 25th of the previous month in the local area shall be used as the basis for calculating the taxable price of liquor. The provincial, city, and district bureaus shall adjust it monthly and report it to the North China Tax Bureau for record. The calculation formula is as follows:
    Average wholesale price × (1 + tax rate) = taxable price
    Taxable price × tax rate = tax amount
    Fruit wine, baijiu, huangjiu, and modified liquor are taxed by the catty.
    Foreign wine is taxed by the dozen.
    Pasteurized beer is taxed by the case (48 bottles).
    Draft beer and alcohol are taxed by the liter.
    Article 12 Except for the collection and administration of state-owned liquor factories, which are governed by separate regulations, the liquor tax of all specially permitted private liquor factories shall be levied and paid in accordance with the following regulations:
    1. For specially permitted manufacturers, the tax shall be paid by the monopoly organ after the liquor is delivered to them.
    2. The liquor tax on temporarily permitted privately sold liquor shall be paid in full before it leaves the factory or is sold.
    3. The liquor tax on modified liquor shall be paid after the modification is completed.
    4. The tax bureau may, when necessary, estimate the output of liquor manufacturers based on their brewing situation and levy the tax accordingly, which shall be paid as stipulated.
    The liquor tax for items 3 and 4 above must be paid on time.
    Article 13 Liquor on which liquor tax has already been paid may not be taxed again when sold throughout the region.
    Chapter IV Collection Procedures
    Article 14 The tax payment certificates for liquor are divided into the following five types:
    1. Tax payment certificate
    2. Bottled liquor inspection certificate
    3. Seal
    4. Packaging certificate
    5. Distribution slip
    Article 15 For the use and inspection of certificates, private liquor shall use the tax payment certificate as the tax payment voucher, and a seal shall be affixed to the container's seal. Bottled liquor shall have a bottled liquor inspection certificate affixed. If large boxes or packages are used, a packaging certificate shall be affixed to the large box or package, and a “verified” stamp shall be affixed to the overlapping part. When transported to the sales location, it must be sent to the local tax bureau for inspection, and only after the original tax payment certificate is stamped with the words "verified for local sale" shall it be permitted for sale.
    Article 16 If liquor on which tax has already been paid needs to be distributed, transported, or repackaged, the original tax payment certificate shall be submitted to the local tax authority for inspection. The original tax payment certificate shall be collected and a distribution slip shall be issued instead. Certificates shall be affixed and sealed, and a verification stamp shall be affixed. For the part that is not requested for distribution, a distribution slip may be issued separately, with the words "local sale" noted in the transportation location column. For those only requesting repackaging without distribution, certificates shall be affixed, and the valid period for requesting distribution shall be noted on the tax payment certificate as three months. After the expiration date, it shall only be allowed to be sold locally. Those who request distribution with a distribution slip shall indicate the original tax payment certificate's expiration date on the distribution slip.
    Article 17 Registered modified liquor merchants shall, before modifying the liquor, report the catties of raw material liquor and the certificate to the local competent tax authority for inspection and dispatch personnel for supervision and production, to ascertain the amount of modification and register it. After the raw material liquor is used up, the original tax payment certificate shall be collected. If it is not used up, the modified part shall be noted on the original tax payment certificate, and a separate tax payment certificate shall be issued.
    Article 18 For used containers for transporting liquor, the old certificates affixed to the containers must be thoroughly washed clean before use.
    Article 19 Retail liquor merchants must obtain a liquor sales license from the local tax authority before being permitted to operate. Those already in business shall apply for this license retroactively. They shall only be allowed to sell liquor wholesale from the monopoly company. Separate regulations shall be formulated for the sales methods of specially permitted privately made and privately sold liquor.
    Chapter V Penalties
    Article 20 Liquor merchants who violate the provisions of these measures shall be penalized in accordance with the following regulations:
    (1) In any of the following circumstances, the goods and tools shall be confiscated in part or in whole, and the liquor tax payable for private brewing shall be retroactively collected:
    1. Those who privately brew liquor without applying for approval and obtaining a business license.
    2. Those who mix grain into fruit wine.
    (2) In any of the following circumstances, a fine of up to 10,000 yuan shall be imposed. Those who evade tax shall still pay the tax in accordance with regulations:

    7. Retail liquor merchants who fail to apply for a liquor sales license.
    8. Yeast-making businesses that fail to report in accordance with regulations or report falsely, or privately sell yeast.
    The power to impose penalties for items 1 and 2 above belongs to the tax authority above the county level. No other organs or individuals have the power to impose penalties.
    (3) In any of the following circumstances, the case shall be referred to the judicial organ for punishment. The tax evaded shall still be handled in accordance with the previous two items:
    1. Those who forge certificates.
    2. Those who refuse to pay taxes or be inspected.
    3. Those who smuggle foreign and enemy area liquor.
    Article 21 Anyone may report the illegal acts in the preceding article. After the case is investigated and verified, 30% of the total amount of fines and confiscations shall be awarded as a bonus. The bonus distribution method shall be handled in accordance with the North China Tax Anti-Smuggling Bonus Distribution Method.
    Article 22 If a merchant or resident disagrees with the punishment imposed by the competent tax authority, they shall first pay the fine and submit an appeal to the superior authority within ten days. If they still disagree with the decision of the superior authority, they may submit a further appeal within ten days, up to the North China People's Government. If the final decision requires changing the original punishment, the original collection and administration organ shall refund the amount accordingly.
    Chapter VI Supplementary Provisions
