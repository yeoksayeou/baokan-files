    Tianjin Municipal Trading Company
    Dumps Gauze
    To Stabilize Rising Prices
    [Tianjin News] In order to curb rising prices, stabilize the market, and crack down on speculative merchants, the Tianjin Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Branch Company sold a large quantity of cloth yesterday. In recent weeks, due to rising grain prices, general speculators have concentrated on the yarn and cloth market, causing a surge in gauze prices: "Sunshine" cloth once reached as high as 7,800 yuan. To curb the increase, the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company began posting prices, with "Sunshine" cloth dropping from 7,600 to 7,400, then to 7,200, and finally to 7,050 and 6,950 yuan. Speculators dared not compete to buy any more. This action by the company dealt a blow to speculative merchants. Some legitimate merchants in the market said: "The only way to deal with unscrupulous merchants is to use this method."

    平市贸易公司
    抛售纱布
    平抑涨风
    【平市讯】本市花纱布分公司，为了抑制涨风，平稳物价，打击投机商人，昨日大量售出布匹。近旬日来，因粮价上涨，一般投机商都集中到纱布市场来，致使纱布造成上涨的高潮：阳光布曾一度高达七八○○元。花纱布公司为抑制上涨，开始挂牌，阳光由七六○○降到七四○○，又降到七二○○，最后到七○五○，六九五○。投机商人才不敢再争购了。该公司这次行动，给投机商人一个打击。市场上有的正当商人说：对付奸商非用这种方法不可。
