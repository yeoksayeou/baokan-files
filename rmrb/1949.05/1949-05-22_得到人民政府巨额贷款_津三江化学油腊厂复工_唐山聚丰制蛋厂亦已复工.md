Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st—The Tianjin private Sanjiang Chemical Oil & Wax Factory, which has been shut down for three years, resumed production on the 17th. This factory is the only glycerin factory in North China, with soap, scented soap, paraffin wax, and anhydrous alcohol departments. In the past, it could produce up to 15 tons of refined glycerin per month, as well as a large number of by-products such as stearic acid and fatty acids. The factory was originally operated by the Japanese invaders as "Ishiken Co., Ltd.," and was later taken over by the Kuomintang. Last May, it was auctioned off to private operators. However, due to the abundance of British and American glycerin on the market, the factory was unable to engage in production and remained closed for three years. After the liberation of Tianjin, the factory raised 6 million yuan to prepare for resumption of production. The Tianjin Jiaotong Bank recently provided a loan of more than 5.4 million yuan in the form of order financing to help solve its financial difficulties. Glycerin is an important crude oil in the chemical industry and is widely used in the manufacture of gunpowder, leather making, paper making, and medicine.

Xinhua News Agency—Tangshan private Jufeng Egg Factory also resumed production on the 5th of this month with the assistance of the People's Government. The factory ceased production in 1941. Under Japanese and Kuomintang rule, it was unable to resume operations due to heavy taxes, lack of raw materials, and export difficulties. After liberation, with fundraising preparations by Tianjin Yixin Egg Factory and the introduction of raw material procurement from various parts of the Northeast by the People's Government, it was able to resume production. At present, the factory can process 200,000 eggs per day, with a monthly output of approximately 60 to 70 tons of finished products.

　　得到人民政府巨额贷款
    津三江化学油腊厂复工
  　唐山聚丰制蛋厂亦已复工
    【新华社天津二十一日电】停工已经三年的天津私营三江化学油腊厂于十七日复工。该厂为华北仅有的甘油工厂，设有肥皂、香皂、洋腊及无水酒精等部。过去每月最高可产精制甘油十五吨及大量软脂酸、脂肪酸等副产品。该厂原为日寇经营的“石碱株式会社”，后由国民党接收，于去年五月又标卖给私人经营。但由于英美甘油充斥市场，该厂始终未能从事生产，停工达三年之久。天津解放后，该厂即集资六百万元筹备复工，津市交通银行最近亦以定货贷款方式，贷给该厂五百四十余万元，帮助其解决资金困难。按甘油为化学工业中重要原油，在制造火药、制革、造纸及医药上用途甚广。
    【又讯】唐山私营聚丰制蛋厂在人民政府协助下亦于本月五日复工。该厂一九四一年即告停工，在日本和国民党统治下，因捐税奇重、原料缺乏以及出口困难而一直未能复业，解放后经天津怡新制蛋厂集资筹备和人民政府介绍到东北各地采购原料，乃得复工。目前该厂每日能打蛋二十万个，每月制成品约六、七十吨。
