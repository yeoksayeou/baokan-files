    [Reported by this newspaper] The People's Bank of China, Taiyuan Branch, has formulated measures for handling the speculation of gold and silver. The measures are as follows:
    I. Those who illegally carry gold or silver, and those who use it for valuation purposes, if the quantity is extremely small and there is no suspicion of speculation, may be exchanged at a depreciated rate of 15% based on the official price, and shall be given education.
    II. Those suspected of speculation shall be exchanged at a depreciated rate of 30% based on the official price.
    III. Those who smuggle gold or silver to aid the enemy shall have all of it confiscated. Those with serious circumstances shall, in addition to confiscation, be fined double the amount or given administrative sanctions.
    IV. Those who privately buy and sell gold or silver shall be dealt with according to the severity of the circumstances: 1. Those who receive or give small amounts and can prove it is not speculation shall be exchanged at a depreciated rate of 20%; those whose amount is small but is indeed speculation shall be exchanged at a depreciated rate of 50%. 2. If the quantity is more than 20 silver dollars, 10 taels of silver, or 5 qian of gold, it shall be confiscated. 3. Speculators who have large quantities and are repeat offenders shall, in addition to confiscation, be fined one to three times the amount.
    V. All military personnel and civilians have the right to report and expose such activities, reporting to the public security department or the government above the district level. Those whose reports lead to the seizure of gold or silver shall be rewarded with 20% of the confiscated value or up to 50% of the difference between the depreciated exchange rate and the official rate.
