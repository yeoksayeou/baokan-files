Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 29th: While the People's Liberation Army was clearing out the remaining enemy forces in Shanghai, over 60,000 workers, staff, and students in Shanghai spontaneously formed People's Security Teams to assist the PLA in guarding and patrolling important areas, securing Kuomintang offices and warehouses, and protecting factories, businesses, and cultural and educational institutions. On the evening of the 24th, when the PLA reached Longhua Town, the workers' militia of the Ordnance Bureau Repair Factory disarmed a platoon of Kuomintang bandit troops stationed at the factory. When the PLA entered the southern district, 40 postal workers immediately rode bicycles to serve as guides for the PLA and deliver letters. Workers from the French Tramway Company drove trucks to help the PLA transport ammunition. Workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard repaired four motorboats in two hours to help the PLA quickly cross the Huangpu River and pursue the fleeing enemy. Doctors and nurses from Zhongshan and Sino-American Hospitals prepared beds and ambulances and spontaneously organized to serve the PLA. Students gathered and requested to go to the battlefield to do rescue work.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 28th: The Shanghai Student Federation, which had persisted in underground struggle during the Kuomintang bandit regime's rule, publicly announced its activities on the 25th following the liberation of Shanghai. On the same day, it issued a "Declaration Celebrating the Liberation of Shanghai and Welcoming the People's Liberation Army" and an "Open Letter to Students Welcoming the Liberation of Shanghai," calling on all schools to quickly resume classes and school operations, participate in maintaining social order and propaganda work, and strengthen the study of New Democratic Revolution theory and various scientific knowledge. Students from all schools responded enthusiastically. Students from universities and vocational schools such as Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, Tongji, St. John's, Hujiang, Great China, Datong, Youya Normal School, and middle schools such as Nanyang and Model High School enthusiastically joined the propaganda work and other tasks. The Student Federation organized a 300-student work team to assist schools that had not previously participated in the Student Federation to establish student organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 28th: Workers at the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company persisted in their work under the encirclement and blockade of the Kuomintang bandit troops, ensuring that the area south of the Suzhou River remained uninterrupted in its electricity supply after liberation. The plant's original power generation was 170,000 kilowatts per hour, with over a thousand workers. On the afternoon of the 24th, Kuomintang bandit troops blockaded the plant, and most of the workers were unable to enter the plant to work. The more than two hundred workers remaining in the plant worked day and night, persisting in delivering electricity for three days and nights, delivering 40,000 kilowatts per hour, enabling most factories south of the Suzhou River to continue operating. On the afternoon of the 27th, Yangshupu was liberated, and all the workers in the plant were overjoyed, covering the inside and outside of the plant with slogans prepared long ago to welcome the People's Liberation Army.

    【新华社上海二十九日电】当解放军肃清上海市区残敌时，上海市有六万多个工人、职员、学生等自动组成人民保安队，协助解放军在各重要地区布岗、巡逻，看管国民党的机关、仓库，保护工厂、企业和文化教育机关。二十四日晚，解放军进抵龙华镇时，兵工署修械厂工人纠察队即将驻守该厂的国民党匪军一个排缴械。解放军进抵南区时，立刻有邮工四十人骑了自行车自动来为解放军做向导和传递信件。法商电车公司工人则驾着卡车帮助解放军输送弹药。江南造船所的工人在两小时内修好四只汽艇帮助解放军迅速渡过黄浦江，追击残敌。中山、中美两医院的医生、看护，准备好了病床和救护车，自动组织起来，要求为解放军服务。学生们则集合起来，要求上战地做救护工作。
    【新华社上海二十八日电】在国民党匪帮统治时期在地下坚持斗争的上海学生联合会，已随上海的解放于二十五日公开活动，并于当日发出“庆祝上海解放欢迎人民解放军宣言”和“迎接上海解放告同学书”，号召各校迅速复课、复校，参加维持社会秩序和参加宣传工作，加强新民主主义革命理论和各种科学知识的学习。各校同学均热烈响应。交通、复旦、暨南、同济、圣约翰、沪江、大夏、大同、幼雅师范等各大学、专科学校，和南洋、模范等各中学广大学生，均兴奋地投入宣传工作和其他工作。学联组织了三百个同学的工作队，协助过去未参加学联的各校建立学生组织。
    【新华社上海二十八日电】上海电力公司杨树浦发电厂工人，在国民党匪军包围封锁下，坚持工作，使解放后的苏州河以南地区始终没有断电。该厂原发电量每小时十七万基罗瓦特，有工人千余人。二十四日下午国民党匪军封锁该厂，大部工人不能进厂工作，留在厂内的二百余工人乃日夜工作，坚持送电连续达三日夜，每小时送电四万基罗瓦特，使苏州河以南工厂大部得以继续开工。二十七日午后，杨树浦解放，全厂工人欢欣若狂，把厂内厂外贴满了早已准备好的欢迎解放军的标语。
