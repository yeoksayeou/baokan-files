Beiping Grain Prices Fall Back Down

[This newspaper] Beiping commodity prices have fluctuated in recent days, with grain prices rising particularly rapidly. As of yesterday (the 3rd), prices generally stopped rising and began to fall back down. According to the person in charge of the Beiping Trading Company: The scope of this price fluctuation is very wide, mainly because: it is currently the season between harvests, and there is drought in various places, causing citizens to rush to buy grain to prepare for famine, creating a temporary imbalance between supply and demand. In addition, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to manipulate and disrupt the market, causing grain prices to fluctuate sharply. During the grain price increases, the Beiping Trading Company sold more than 17 million jin of various food grains in various ways within ten days (April 21st to April 30th). In order to further stabilize grain prices, in addition to dredging grain sources and shipping large quantities of grain from the Northeast and Northwest to Beiping, a portion of our strength has been allocated to actively transport grain to grain-deficient areas, in order to strive for stable grain prices in various places. It has begun to rain in some areas of North China, and grain prices should become stable. (Yu)

　　平市粮价回跌
    【本报讯】平市物价连日波动，尤以粮价上涨较快，至昨（三）日始普遍止涨回跌。据北平贸易公司负责人谈：此次物价波动范围很广，主要原因是：目前正值青黄不接季节，各地又呈旱象，市民争购粮食备荒，形成一时供求失衡、加以奸商乘机操纵，扰乱市场，于是粮价波动很烈。北平贸易公司在粮价上涨中，即以各种方式于十天（四月二十一日至三十日）内售出各种食粮一千七百余万斤。为进一步平稳粮价，除疏导粮源，由东北、西北启运大批粮食来平外，还抽出一部力量开始主动向缺粮区进行输粮，以争取各地粮价平稳。现华北有些地区已开始下雨，粮价当可转趋平稳。（宇）
