Young Hero Ma Shaokong

Su Zhi

Ma Shaokong had just returned from an exercise by the river when the instructor notified him: "You have been elected as a youth representative for the entire army! Prepare quickly to go to Beiping for the conference!"

Beiping, the place where the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao are located. The nineteen-year-old special-class combat hero is going there to attend the National Youth Congress – what glory! He wore a dark green military uniform, the silver medal of the People's Hero shimmering on his left chest, and the red edge of the hero's commemorative booklet peeking out from his pocket. He was sturdily built, with a ruddy complexion, and his bright eyes could not conceal the joy in his heart.

Ma Shaokong, from Qinyang, Henan, was born into a suffering peasant family. He didn't know when his father died, and when he was still a child, his mother remarried due to the hardships of life. He was raised by his uncle from an early age, starting to pick up coal cinders at the age of eight, and working as a hired hand for a rich man in the city at the age of twelve. He said: "I have never been loved since I was a child, and I have never had anyone I liked; besides the Communist Party, besides comrades, who else is my family?!" In 1947, Qinyang was liberated, and the fate of this seventeen-year-old child took a turn for the better. He broke free from the rich man's house and joined the People's Liberation Army. In 1948, he became a probationary member of the Communist Party of China due to his hard work and camaraderie. He said: "I can't help but shed tears when I think of the old days." The days of shedding tears in the past have become the source of his endless power of revenge today. In the early stages of the Huaihai Campaign, he was a mutual aid group leader in the glorious old Red Army company – a model combat company in the entire division. In the fierce battle of the major offensive south of the Jiangnan River in November, he led this assault group, passing through the artillery fire, crossing the open ground, and skillfully maneuvering to the enemy's flank, capturing the enemy's bunker and ensuring the smooth completion of the task by the entire company. When ordered to transfer, one of the comrades in the group was seriously injured during the enemy's counterattack. Ma Shaokong immediately picked up his gun and carried him on his back. The wounded comrade was shot and killed on his back. A new comrade said: "Group leader, leave him behind!" But Ma Shaokong said: "We can't abandon revolutionary comrades even if they die. Abandoning them is a disgrace!" At the cost of his own life, he carried the comrade's body more than two miles away.

On December 7th last year, in the battle to annihilate the main force of the "Youth Corps" of the 11th Division of the Huang Wei Corps, Ma Shaokong had been transferred to the company headquarters as a messenger. Before the battle, he proposed to the Party branch: guarantee to strive for Party membership on the front line through the test of battle (become a full member). He delivered letters twice and was wounded twice. The gun stock was red with blood flowing down his hands. The instructor told him to go down from the front line first to bandage his wounds, but he said: "My legs are not broken, and I can speak. I can still complete the task!" At that time, the battle was fierce, and he went to deliver a letter for the third time, and was wounded in two more places by shrapnel. When he returned after completing the task, the instructor again urged him to go down. He still refused and said: "Whether I can realize my guarantee at the branch depends on this moment!" When launching the assault, he again requested to serve as the leader of the assault group in the platoon. He finally took the lead in taking down the enemy's forward bunker with his wounded body, proving himself worthy of being a people's soldier nurtured by the heroic tradition of the model company. Throughout the entire campaign, he captured a mortar, three light and heavy machine guns, nine submachine guns, and a box of documents all by himself. He was approved by the branch to become a full Party member ahead of schedule, and was given a meritorious service award on the front line by the entire company. He was also selected as a special-class hero at the division's hero conference.

When he received the notice to attend the congress, he said: "There are many heroes and meritorious officials. Let them go. My plan to cross the river has not yet been realized!" The comrades said: "Ma Shaokong, you represent us to go to Beiping to attend the congress. Remember to tell Chairman Mao what we said. Please let him hear the good news of our liberation of Jiangnan! Don't worry about your task of crossing the river. We guarantee to complete it! When you come back, don't forget what Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu said. We are waiting to hear it!"

Ma Shaokong blushed, both ashamed and happy, and said: "I will definitely report everyone's determination to Chairman Mao, hoping that everyone will strive to break through the river defense, and everyone will make meritorious deeds, bring the good news of victory to Beiping, and bring honor to our young soldiers. I will definitely learn humbly at the congress, and after returning, I will make up for it with another meritorious service!"

When this young hero nurtured by the Communist Party brought the determination of the entire regiment to Beiping, on the Jiangnan front east of Madang on the Yangtze River, the assault regiment that had victoriously crossed the Yangtze River sent a telegram to their beloved young comrade Ma Shaokong, asking him to convey to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: "We have realized our determination, broken through the enemy's defense line in the heavy rain, and first planted the victorious red flag on the Red Bank Lighthouse of the enemy's beachhead. We unanimously support your combat order issued on the 21st, resolutely advance bravely, and annihilate all reactionaries who dare to resist!"

    青年英雄马绍孔
    苏之
    马绍孔刚从江边演习回来，指导员就通知他：“你当选了全军的青年代表了，赶快准备，到北平开大会去！”
    北平，中共中央和毛主席所在的地方，十九岁的特等战斗英雄要到那里出席全国青年代表大会去了，多光荣！他穿着深绿色军装，人民英雄的银质奖章在左胸上闪烁着，英雄纪念手册在口袋里露出一道红边。他身体结实，面色红润，焕发的大眼睛无法掩盖内心的喜悦。
    马绍孔，河南沁阳人，出身在一个受难的农民家庭，他不知道父亲是什么时候死的，当他还是个小孩的时候，母亲就为生活所迫改嫁了。他自幼寄养在叔父家里，八岁起开始拾煤渣，十二岁时给城里的老财当雇工。他说：“我从小就没有被人爱过，我也没有过喜欢；除了共产党，除了同志，我还有谁是亲的？！”一九四七年沁阳解放，当时这个十七岁的孩子的命运才翻了个身，他从老财的家里挣脱出来，参加了解放军，在一九四八年便以艰苦和友爱的表现成为中国共产党的候补党员。他说：“一想起从前的日子，我忍不住流泪。”以往流泪的日子成了他今天无穷的复仇的力量底泉源。在淮海战役初期，他是全师战斗模范连——光荣的老红军连队里的一个互助组长。十一月江河南岸大出击的激烈战中，他带领着这个突击组，穿过炮火，越过了开阔地，机警灵活地向敌侧冀迂回，夺取了敌人地堡，保证了全连顺利完成任务。奉命转移的时候，组里一个同志在敌人反扑时负了重伤，马绍孔立刻捡起他的枪，将他背起来。负伤的同志在他背上中弹牺牲了，新同志说：“组长、扔下他吧！”马绍孔却说：“死也不能扔下革命同志，扔掉了就是耻辱！”宁可以自己的生命作为代价，他把同志的尸体背出二里路以外。
    去年十二月七日，歼灭黄维兵团十一师主力“青年团”的战斗中，马绍孔已调到连部当通讯员。战前他便在支部大会上向党提出：保证在战斗的考验中争取火线转党（转为正式党员）。他送两次信负了两次伤，血顺着手流的枪拴都红了。指导员叫他先下火线去札好伤口，他说：“我腿没有断，嘴可以说，我还可以完成任务！”当时战斗正烈，他第三次去送信，又被炮弹片伤了两处。他完成任务回来，指导员再次催促他下去。他还是拒绝说：“我能不能实现在支部上的保证，就看这时候了！”发起冲锋时他又要求到班里担任突击组长。他终于以负伤的身体领头打下敌前沿地堡，不愧为模范连的英勇传统教养出来的人民战士。在整个战役中，他一个人缴获了一门迫击炮，三个轻、重机枪，九枝冲锋枪和一箱文件。他被支部通过提早转党，被全连通过火线记功，并全在师群英大会上被选为特等英雄。
    当他接到出席代表大会的通知时，他说：“英雄功臣多着呢，让他们去吧，我的过江计划还没有实现！”同志们却说：“马绍孔，你代表我们到北平开大会，记得把我们的话告诉毛主席啊，请他听我们解放江南的好消息吧！你的过江任务，放心好了，我们保证完成！回来时可别忘了毛主席和朱总司令讲的话，我们等着听啊！”
    马绍孔红着验，又惭愧又高兴地说：“我一定把大家的决心报告毛主席，希望大家争取突破江防，人人立功，把胜利消息带到北平，给我们青年战士增光，我在大会上一定虚心学习，回来以后再补上立个功！”
    当这位由共产党培养出来的青年英雄把全团的决心书带到北平时，在长江前线马当以东的江南阵地上，胜利渡过了长江的突击团就给他们心爱的青年战友马绍孔拍来一个电报，请他转告毛主席、朱总司令说：“我们已经实现了我们的决心，在大雨中突破敌人的防线，把胜利的大红旗首先插在敌人滩头阵地的红岸灯塔上。我们一致拥护你们二十一日发布的战斗命令，坚决奋勇前，进歼灭一切敢于抵抗的反动派！”
