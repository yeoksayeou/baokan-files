  　Democratic Student Federation Established
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th] Karachi Dispatch: The Pakistan Times reported on the 26th that the Pakistan Democratic Students Federation has been established in West Punjab. In a declaration issued on the 22nd, the Federation demanded that the Pakistani government fundamentally reform Pakistan's social and economic life, especially by abolishing the land ownership system of feudal landlords without compensation, nationalizing all basic industries and large banks, formulating a new democratic constitution, abolishing anti-people so-called "public security maintenance" laws, severing all ties with the British Commonwealth, and declaring Pakistan an independent sovereign republic.
  　Eisler Released
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th] Polish News Agency reports: German anti-fascist leader Eisler, who was illegally arrested by the British authorities, has been released on the 27th under the protests of people all over the world. Eisler issued a statement to the press stating that he is willing to return to his country and teach at the University of Leipzig. Eisler was arrested by the British authorities on the 14th while passing through Southampton, England, on his way home on the Polish ship "Batory," in accordance with the order of the US government. This action by the British authorities, which violated international law and infringed on human rights, immediately aroused protests from the Polish government and progressive groups and democrats all over the world. Seeing that the power of the people could not be taken lightly, the British reactionaries had no choice but to reject the US government's request for extradition and restore Eisler's freedom.

  　民主学联成立
    【新华社北平二十八日电】喀喇蚩讯：巴基斯坦时报二十六日载称：巴基斯坦民主学生联合会已在西旁遮普成立。联合会于二十二日发表的宣言中，要求巴基斯坦政府根本改革巴基斯坦的社会及经济生活，尤其是要无赔偿地废除封建地主的土地所有权制度，将一切基本工业及大银行收归国有、制定新的民主宪法、废除反人民的所谓“公安维持”法，与不列颠联邦断绝一切联系，并宣布巴基斯坦为独立的主权共和国。
  　艾斯勒获释
    【新华社北平二十八日电】波兰通讯社报道：被英国当局非法逮捕的德国反法西斯领袖艾斯勒，在全世界人民的抗议下，已于二十七日恢复自由。艾斯勒向报界发表声明，他愿回到他的祖国，到莱比锡大学任教。艾斯勒是十四日在乘波兰轮船“白桃利”号返国途中，路经英国南安普顿时，被英国当局遵奉美国政府命令所逮捕。英国当局这种违反国际法和侵犯人权的行动，立刻引起波兰政府和全世界进步团体与民主人士的抗议。英国反动派鉴于人民力量不可轻侮，遂不得不拒绝美国政府引渡的要求，而恢复艾斯勒的自由。
