　　Beiping Private Match and Flour Industries Generally Increase Production
    [Report from this newspaper] Private match, flour (including two state-owned and one joint state-private), carpet, porcelain kiln, and cigarette industries in Beiping Municipality all saw increases in production in April. Five match factories produced 1,508 boxes, an increase of 308 boxes compared to the 1,200 boxes produced by six factories in March (Nanyang Match Factory suspended production in April due to a fire). Fifteen machine-operated flour mills produced 128,988 bags in April, an increase of 6,735 bags compared to March. Dahuayao Ceramics Company (the only porcelain kiln) produced eight kilns in April, an increase of three kilns compared to March, equivalent to an increase of 90,000 pieces. The reasons for the increase are mainly that labor and management have begun to understand the policies of the People's Government, and are gradually moving towards a path of mutual benefit for labor and management, thus gradually reducing labor-management disputes; at the same time, the government has assisted the industrial sector in solving some difficulties, such as reducing tax rates (tax rates for flour, matches, cigarettes, etc. have all been reduced), purchasing finished products (cloth, matches, cigarettes, iron pots, etc.), and supplying raw materials. However, there are still many objective difficulties at present, such as the raw material problem for the paper industry, the sales problem for the weaving and iron industries, and the export problem for the carpet industry, all of which urgently need to be resolved.

　　平私营火柴面粉业普遍增产
    【本报讯】平市私营火柴、面粉（包括公营两家、公私合营一家）、地毡、磁窑、卷烟等工业，四份月产量普遍增加。五家火柴工厂出产一五○八箱，较三月份六家工厂出一二○○箱，增加三○八箱（南阳火柴厂因失火，四月份停工）。机器面粉业十五厂四月份出产一二八九八八袋，较三月份增加六七三五袋。大华窑业公司（磁窑仅此一家）四月份出产八窑，较三月份增加三窑，即增加九万件。增加的原因，主要是劳资双方开始了解了人民政府的政策，逐步走向劳资两利的途径，劳资纠纷因而逐渐减少；同时政府协助工业界解决了一些困难、如灭低税率（面粉、火柴、卷烟等业税率都已减低），收购成品（布匹、火柴、烟卷、铁锅等），供给原料、但目前客观困难尚多，如造纸业的原料问题，织布业和铁工业的销路问题，地毯业的出口问题等，都急待解决。（鸣）
