    How the 70th Arsenal Adjusted Wages?
    Shang Kai    Currently, the employees in public enterprises and factories in Beiping City are brewing a universal demand: that is, "to reform the unreasonable parts of the enterprise, and appropriately adjust personnel and wages." The 70th Arsenal, based on this demand of employees, has appropriately adjusted the wage grade issue, thereby stabilizing employee morale and igniting a production upsurge.
   (1) Past Wage Grades Were Unreasonable
    Before liberation, the 70th Arsenal had complex, dark, and unreasonable personnel and wage systems. At that time, in order to strengthen its control over workers, the Kuomintang implemented extremely barbaric special agent rule and military organization within the factory; employees were all given school and military ranks to drive and condone them to rule and oppress workers. Some of them did not engage in production, but enjoyed very high salaries, creating a sharp opposition among employees. Under this dark personnel system, many skilled workers were buried for a long time and could not be promoted because they did not have special personnel connections. On the contrary, many incompetent people occupied important positions and enjoyed high-level treatment because of "fellow villagers," "classmates," and "nepotism." For example, Guo Ziyang, who managed the employee sign-in book in the engineering office of the factory, had a leisurely job all day long, but he was given the title of Major Engineer because he was a classmate of the director of the engineering office, and could receive 685 catties of millet per month. However, Liu Huanzhou, a technician in the fuse department of the Fourth Institute, was demoted to a long-term worker with 90 catties of millet per month because he offended the leaders. In addition, the monthly monetary wages could only maintain three days of single-person living due to the rapid depreciation of the pseudo-gold yuan; even with the allocation of so-called "welfare goods," it was still impossible to maintain the minimum living standards of a worker's family.
    (2) Mobilizing Employees to Evaluate and Reasonably Adjust Wages
    After the liberation of Beiping, although our working group discovered the unreasonable aspects of the old wage system in the 70th Arsenal, the decision was made by the takeover working group because all the employees in the factory had not yet been mobilized: workers would remain in their original positions and salaries; however, in order to change the excessive disparity between employees and workers, to encourage the improvement of skills, and to strengthen employee unity, the wage standard in the old liberated areas was used as a reference, stipulating that the salary of the lowest employee should not exceed the third grade and third level of workers (workers were divided into six grades and six levels). Based on this principle: the average total income per person per month for the previous three months was converted into millet according to the price index at that time, and February wages were paid. However, another problem was overlooked here: reducing employees' salaries according to a certain standard without distinguishing between them.
    Therefore, when the temporary adjustment method for February wages was proposed, it caused a fluctuation because employees were not satisfied.
    The employee preparatory committee and working cadres accepted the opinions of the employees, and after research, announced the principles for adjusting wages in the future at the general employee meeting: most would remain unchanged, and for the few who were skilled but buried, or who were incompetent but relied on "connections" to obtain higher positions, the method of representative meetings and democratic evaluation would be adopted to give appropriate promotions or demotions according to their talents. At the same time, it was arranged that each institute should elect representatives according to different production and work units to participate in the evaluation; the representatives must be fair and familiar with the technical conditions and work attitude of the employees in their units as the standard.
    Faced with this new task, the employee preparatory committee and working cadres, in order to be cautious and gain experience, decided to conduct key experiments in the First Institute and the Cost Section.
    The wage evaluation was divided into three steps: preliminary evaluation, institute evaluation, and factory evaluation.
    Before the start of the wage evaluation, because the cadres in that department did not work carefully enough, they only gave a simple explanation of the principles of wage adjustment to the worker representatives of each unit of the First Institute and the employee representatives of the Cost Section, and then returned to their respective units, together with the heads of departments, to convene workers for preliminary evaluation. Therefore, in the preliminary evaluation, employees mistakenly believed that the adjustment of wages was a universal increase in wages, and because they were concerned about face and did not criticize, they only talked about advantages and not disadvantages, echoed each other, and did not raise objections in their speeches.
    The above-mentioned bias was caused not only by insufficient prior preparation, and the representatives did not truly understand the spirit of wage adjustment and grasp the principles of wage adjustment, but also because the selected representatives were impure and some workers were manipulated by them. For example, two of the representatives were Kuomintang district-level officials who attempted to use this to incite workers to transfer factories. The working cadres did not go deep into the leadership and provide specific help, allowing them to drift and failing to correct them in time. The working group studied this situation and analyzed the reasons for the bias, so on the one hand, it mobilized workers to wash away the impure representatives, and on the other hand, it convened the representatives to further explain the adjustment principles and let them study the specific implementation methods. Afterwards, all the working cadres followed the representatives into each unit to conduct a second preliminary evaluation. In this way, the general employees broke through the concern for face and launched criticism. However, the employees, because they could not break through the concern for face with each other, could not proceed and were temporarily stopped.
    After the evaluation of the First Institute was completed, other institutes were mobilized to elect representatives for evaluation. Because they accepted the experience and lessons of the First Institute, no major problems occurred from the preliminary evaluation to the institute evaluation.
    After the evaluation of all the institutes in the factory was completed, the representatives carried the results of the institute evaluation to the factory to gather, and worker representatives, employee representatives, heads of each institute, and factory director and deputy factory director were invited to participate in the factory evaluation. In the factory evaluation, there was a bias towards departmentalism, with each institute emphasizing the importance of its own department. After explanation, it was quickly corrected. The factory evaluation took two days to complete and produced a wage adjustment plan.
    After all the workers' wages were adjusted, an employee meeting was convened, and worker representatives were invited to participate. At this meeting, criticism and self-criticism were launched, and a profound review was made of the reasons why the evaluation had not been good in the past. After the review, the employees also deeply felt that if they wanted to do a good job in the future, they must break through the concern for face. After a period of brewing and mobilization, the formal evaluation was officially conducted. In the evaluations at all levels, workers were invited to participate, and the evaluation process was relatively smooth.
    (3) Using Talents According to Their Abilities, Employees Are Satisfied
    After the wage grade adjustment in the 70th Arsenal, the general employees said: "It is more reasonable than before." This is the overall evaluation of this wage adjustment by all employees. It not only changed the unreasonable wage grades caused by "connections" in the past, but also made appropriate promotions for talents who had been buried for a long time. For example, Liu Fusheng, a technician in the First Institute, had not been promoted for a long time because he had no personnel connections; after liberation, he led workers to overcome all difficulties and produce weapons, making great contributions to the revolutionary war; this time he has been promoted from the former Lieutenant to the First Grade and First Level (equivalent to the former Captain). Another example is Liu Huanzhou, a technician in the fuse department of the Fourth Institute, who was demoted because he offended the leaders, and was also promoted to a fourth-grade and fourth-level technician, receiving 205 catties of millet per month. On the contrary, in this wage adjustment, those who were incompetent and only relied on special relationships to obtain positions were also evaluated by everyone, and were appropriately demoted according to their existing skills and work ability. Although some of the demoted employees expressed dissatisfaction, most of them still expressed their conviction and were determined to work hard again to strive for it.

### 七十兵工厂怎样调整了工资？

    七十兵工厂怎样调整了工资？
    商恺    目前北平市各公营企业工厂中的职工，正酝酿着一个普遍的要求：这就是“改革企业中不合理的部分，适当的调整人事和工资。”七十兵工厂根据职工这一要求，已适当地调整了工资等级问题，从而稳定了职工的情绪，并掀起了生产热潮。
   （一）过去工资等级不合理
    解放前的七十兵工厂，是存在着复杂、黑暗、与不合理的人事制度和工资制度的。那时，国民党为了加强对工人的统治，在厂内实行极其野蛮的特务统治和军事编制，职员一律加上校尉官衔；驱使与纵容他们去统治工人，压迫工人，他们当中有些人并不从事生产，而享受很高的薪资，造成职工相当尖锐的对立。在这种黑暗的人事制度下，很多技术高的工人，因为没有特种的人事关系，而被长期埋没，不得提升；相反的，有不少无能者，却因有“同乡”、“同学”、“裙带关系”，而身居要职，享受高级待遇。如该厂工务处管理职工签到簿的郭子阳，终日工作清闲，只因和工务处长是同学关系，而获得了少校工程师的头衔，每月可拿到小米六百八十五斤。而象四所引信部技工刘焕周，因得罪了领导人，却被降为每月九十斤小米的长工。加以每月发的货币工资，因为伪金圆券的急剧贬值，只能维持到三天的单人生活；即使加上所谓“福利品”等的配给，仍是无法维持一个工人家庭的最低生活。
    （二）发动职工评议、合理调整工资
    北平解放后，我工作组虽发现了七十兵工厂旧工资制度不合理的地方，但因当时全厂职工还没有发动，便由接管工作组决定：工人仍按原职原薪不动；但为了改变职员与工人间过大的悬殊，以鼓励提高技术，加强职工团结，便参照老解放区工资标准，规定最低职员之薪资不能超过工人的三等三级（工人共分六等六级），根据这一原则：便按前三个月每人每月的平均总收入，照当时物价指数折成小米，发放二月份工资。但这里却忽视了另一个问题：按一定标准压低职员薪资，没有分别对待。
    因此当二月份工资临时调整办法提出后，因职工不满意，曾引起了一场波动。
    职工筹委会与工作干部接受了职工的意见，经过研究，就在全体职工大会上，宣布今后调整工资的原则：大多数不动，对少数有技术而被埋没，或本身无能而依靠“门窗”获得较高职位者，采取代表会议、民主评定方式，量才给以适当的升降。同时布置了：各所部按不同的生产与工作单位，选举代表，参加评议；代表条件一定是为人公正，并对本单位职工技术条件、劳动态度熟悉者为标准。
    职工筹委会与工作干部面对这一新的工作，为了慎重并取得经验，决定从第一所和成本课进行重点试验。
    评议工资共分三个步骤：初评、所评、厂评。
    在开始评议工资前，由于该处干部工作不够仔细，对第一所各单位工人代表与成本课职员代表，只简单的说明了调整工资的原则，便各自回到本单位，协同各主管，召集工人进行初评。因此在初评中，职工均误以为调整工资是普遍提高工资，又因爱面子不批评，所以，发言中光说优点，不说缺点，随声附和，不提反对意见。
    发生上述偏向，除因事前准备不足，各代表没有真正领会调整工资的精神，和掌握调整工资的原则以外，所选代表不纯，部份工人被其操纵也是一个原因。如代表中就有两个国民党区级负责人，企图借此鼓动工人转厂。而工作干部，又未深入领导，具体帮助，以致让其自流，未能及时纠正。工作组研究了这一情况，并分析了发生偏向的原因，遂一面发动工人洗刷不纯的代表，一面召集各代表，再具体说明调整原则，让其研究了具体进行的办法，随后全体工作干部，分别跟随各代表深入各单位，进行第二次初评。这样，一般职工才打破了情面，展开批评。但职员方面，却终因互相间打不破情面，无法进行，而暂时停止。
    第一所所评完毕，便发动其他各所部推选代表进行评议，因为接受了第一所的经验教训，从初评到所评均无发生大的问题。
    全厂所评完以后，各代表再携带所评结果，到厂集合，并请工人代表、职员代表、各所部主管、正副厂长参加，进行厂评。在厂评中，曾发生了本位主义的偏向，各所强调本部门工作重要。经过解释，很快也就纠正了。厂评共经两天时间，始做出了工资调整方案。
    工人工资全部调整完毕后，即召集职员会议，并请工人代表参加。在这个会上展开了批评与自我批评，对过去未能评好的原因做了深刻的检讨。经过检讨，职员也深深感到了今后要想评好，必须打破情面。会后，又经过一段酝酿与发动，始正式进行评议。在各级评议中，并邀请工人参加，评议过程比较顺利。
    （三）量才使用，职工满意
    七十兵工厂，经过了调整工资等级，一般职工都说：“比以前合理了。”这就是全体职工对这次调整工资的总评价。它不但改变了过去因“门子”“窗户”而造成的不合理的工资等级，而且对长期被埋没的人材，都作了适当的提升。如第一所技术员刘福生，因没有人事关系，长期得不到提拔；在解放后曾领导工人克服一切困难，制出武器，对革命战争贡献很大；这次已由过去的中尉提升为一等一级（相当过去的上尉）。又如因得罪领导人而被降级的四所引信部技工刘换周，也被升为四等四级技工，每月能拿到二百零五斤小米。相反的，在这次调整工资中，对那些不称职而只依靠特种关系获得职位的人，也经过大家评议，根据现有技术与工作能力，予以适当的降级。那些降级的职员，虽有个别人员表示不满，但多数还是表示心服，并下定决心再努力争取。
