Drafts Curriculum Reform Plan: Engineering to be Integrated with Factories

[Ping City News] The curriculum reform discussion at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University has concluded, and a draft curriculum reform plan for the transitional period has been announced. In the draft, courses previously considered unreasonable or unnecessary by students, such as Freshman Chinese, English, Surveying, and Hydraulic Experiments, have been cancelled. Factory internships in metalworking, casting, and mold-making have also been moved to the summer vacation. In principle, the number of credits per semester will not exceed nineteen, and in-class study will not exceed fifty hours per week, to avoid overburdening students. The basic spirit of the draft is to cultivate engineering talents capable of independent production, design, and manufacturing, rather than training personnel who only know how to use foreign machines or maintain existing equipment. The discussion criticized the past engineering education for simply copying European and American curricula, resulting in a disconnect between theory and practice, and pointed out that current university education should establish the goal of "serving the people." In terms of learning methods, it was proposed that engineering students should be closely integrated with factories, strengthen summer internships, and professors should participate in production, directly joining factory work.

    拟定课程改革草案  工科要与工厂结合
    【平市讯】清华大学机械系学制改革讨论已经结束，公布了所拟的过渡期间课程改革草案。在草案里，以前同学所认为不合理的和不需要的如大一国文、英文、测量、水力实验等课已经取消。金工、铸工、制模等工厂实习亦决定移至暑假。每学期学分原则上不超过十九个，课内学习每周不超过五十小时，以免同学负担太重。草案的基本精神是培养能够独立生产、设计、制造的工程人才，而不是训练一批只懂得如何使用外国机器或者维持原有设备的人员。讨论中曾批判了过去的工程教育单纯抄袭欧美课程，理论与实际脱节，指出现在的大学教育应确立“为人民服务”的目的。在学习方法上，提出工科生要跟工厂密切结合，加强暑假实习，并提出教授参加生产，直接加入工厂工作。（林在旭、清华通讯组）
