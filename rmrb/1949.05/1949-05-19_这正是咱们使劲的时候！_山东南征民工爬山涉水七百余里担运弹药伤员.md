　　This is exactly the time for us to exert our strength!
    Shandong conscripted laborers trek over mountains and rivers for more than 700 li to carry ammunition and wounded soldiers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 18th] The Shandong conscripted labor corps, following the army in the southern campaign, completed the arduous task of carrying supplies during the long-distance pursuit of fleeing enemies in Jiangnan. The Jiaodong Donghai District labor transport corps traveled over mountains and rivers for more than 700 li in nine days and nights, following the army's advance. Yinan (newly established county) laborers transported 71,000 jin of ammunition and transferred 216 wounded soldiers in half a month of pursuit operations. When the Donghai transport corps was transporting ammunition from Nanling to Xuancheng, they additionally took in more than 280 wounded soldiers along the way. After arriving in Xuancheng, they continued to advance in the rain, traveling more than 200 li in two and a half days, eating only three meals in total, and resting for at most three hours a day. A certain battalion of the Yinan labor corps traveled back and forth twice on a 90-li journey in one day, carrying 70 jin of ammunition each way and carrying wounded soldiers on the return. In another continuous four-day march, some loads weighed as much as 90 jin, and many carrying poles were broken along the way. However, the morale of the laborers was very high. Some fell more than 20 times a night but still carried the wounded without complaint, and some had large blisters on their feet but still actively helped the weaker laborers carry things. They constantly encouraged each other, saying, "This is exactly the time for us to exert our strength. If we don't perform meritorious service now, when will we?" They took meticulous care of the wounded soldiers, demonstrating the working people's high degree of class love. Some took off their clothes in the heavy rain and covered the wounded soldiers, and some used the money they saved from their meals to buy firewood to dry the wounded soldiers' clothes. To reduce the suffering of the wounded soldiers, they carefully faced the wounded soldiers' heads forward when going uphill and turned them around when going downhill. The Donghai transport corps laborers used various methods to keep the stretchers stable in the rain, so as not to shake the wounded soldiers. When encountering fleeing bandits during the march, the laborers bravely defended the wounded soldiers. They organized group messengers and armed laborers east of Guangde, escorting more than 60 wounded soldiers to safety, and captured 61 enemy stragglers and five war horses along the way.

### 这正是咱们使劲的时候！  山东南征民工爬山涉水七百余里担运弹药伤员

　　这正是咱们使劲的时候！
    山东南征民工爬山涉水七百余里担运弹药伤员
    【新华社浙赣前线十八日电】随军南征的山东民工团在横扫江南逃敌的长距离追击作战中，完成了艰巨的担运任务。胶东东海区民工担运团曾在九昼夜间爬山涉水，随军前进了七百余里。沂南（新设县）民工在半个月的追击作战中运送了七万一千斤弹药和转运了二百一十六名伤员。东海担运团从南陵向宣城运送弹药时，沿途额外收容了二百八十多名伤员，到达宣城后又冒雨继续前进，在两天半中走了二百多里，总共只吃了三顿饭，每天顶多休息三个钟头。沂南民工第三营某天曾在九十里的路程上往返两次，去时每人挑着七十斤弹药，回时则抬着伤员。在另一次连续四天的行军中，有的担子重达九十斤，沿途挑断了许多扁担。但是民工的情绪都很高涨，有的一夜跌了二十多跤还是毫无怨言地抬运伤员，有的双脚打起了大水泡还是积极帮助体弱的民工背东西。他们不断地互相鼓励着说：“这正是咱们使劲的时候，现在不立功还等什么时候？”他们对伤员们无微不至地关照，表现了劳动人民高度的阶级友爱。有的在大雨中赤着身子，把自己的衣服给伤员盖上，有的把自己节约的菜金买柴草把伤员的衣服烘干。为了减少伤员痛苦，上坡时他们小心地让伤员的头朝着前面，下坡时又调转过来。东海担运团民工在雨途中用各种办法使担架保持平稳，不让伤员受震动。在进行中与溃逃的匪军遭遇时，民工们便勇敢地保卫伤员。他们曾在广德以东组织了团体通讯员和带枪的民工，掩护六十多个伤员转移到安全地带，并在途中活捉了六十一个敌人散兵和五匹战马。
