Five Poems
Liu Yazi

On the night of April 23rd, upon hearing that the liberation army had taken Nanjing, I was overjoyed and composed this poem.

With a million soldiers, the communist army is extravagant,
The remaining bandits flee in disarray to the ends of the earth.
No one can write like Jiang Zong anymore,
And golden powder never killed Lihua.
Truly happy to have turned the tables and become the people,
Not sad for the fleeing despots who are losing their lives.
The heroic spirits in the underworld should laugh together,
Zhang, Yun, Hou, and Liu, all in one cart. (Note 1)
Note 1: Zhang Yingchun, Yun Daiying, Hou Shaoqiu, and Liu Chongmin were all martyrs who were sacrificed in Nanjing after Chiang betrayed the revolution.

The Biyun Temple and Zijin Mountain,
I reluctantly deleted the passing on of the mantle.
The demolition and destruction back then had a purpose,
What shame is there in divination now?
Sooner or later, believe that Sun and Mao are not different (Note 1),
Judgment should still be listed in the history books.
Looking north to Guling and south to the wild geese,
Du Fu's tears and Gong Zizhen's weakness.
Note 1: Using a line from Ms. Fan Zhichao, a disciple of the Three People's Principles.

April 28th, composed this poem to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the martyrdom of Li Shou Chang.

Hee-ju Zhongzi bears a false name,
The tiger-shooting general, You Beiping.
Snatching the pen, Jiang Yan's talent is just a dream,
Holding the beard, Wen Xu died still alive.
At that time, the domineering spirit can be in the same tune,
The tide of the seas should lean to the left.
Do not resent the transformation of Chang Hong into jade,
The people are important, the individual is light.

Feeling on May Day
How can one bear to forget the bloody history of Paris,
The scarlet camellias are different from blue and yellow. (Note 1)
A hundred years of fighting to advance,
Celebrations worldwide are seen in the newspapers.
Today, the Soviet capital is truly a paradise,
At that time, the Cantonese border was casually measured. (Note 2)
Ashamed of my clumsiness in seclusion,
I have already seen the red tide surging through the sea and rivers.
Note 1: It is said that the May Day parade originated in Paris when two young men and women carried white camellias with the workers' contingent. Suddenly, gunfire erupted, and both were injured and fell to the ground, their blood staining the camellias red, which gradually became a commemoration.
Note 2: The May Day of 1926 was the first time that May Day was commemorated in China. I first went to Guangzhou, concealed myself among the crowd, listened to workers' speeches, and red flags were flying. I was delighted to see it, and it has been twenty-three years since then!

A poem commemorating the May Fourth Movement, composed for the Benliu Society of the Affiliated High School of Fu Jen Catholic University.

How can one forget the pioneers of the revolution,
The surprise troops of the May Fourth Movement rose in haste.
Early glimpse of the bright road to rapid progress,
Crushing patched-up, tattered chapters.
The outdated Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi are gone (Note 1),
The contributions of Cai Yuanpei and Li Dazhao are immeasurable. (Note 2)
This year is a good year for creating a new world,
It has already been reported that the Red Army has crossed the Yangtze River.
Note 1: Chen Duxiu did not finish well in his later years, and Hu Shi was even more brazen and shameless, which is a stain on the May Fourth Movement.
Note 2: Referring to Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Li Dazhao.

    诗五首
    柳亚子
    四月二十三深夜，闻解放大军已下南都，喜极赋此。
    荼火军容百万奢，残酋狼狈各天涯。
    文章久已无江总，金粉何曾杀丽华。
    真喜翻身到民众，宁悲亡命窜豪家。
    英灵地下应同笑，张恽侯刘鬼一车（注一）
    注一：张应春、恽代英、侯绍裘、刘重民诸烈土，皆蒋逆背叛革命后牺牲于南京者。
    碧云寺与紫金山，衣钵薪传我忍删。
    当日迁毁原有意，此时卜雒复何惭。
    后先不信孙毛异（注一），评判还应列史班
    。
    北望觚棱南望雁，杜陵涕泪定庵孱。
    注一：用三传弟子范志超女士句。
    四月二十八日，为李守常先烈成仁二十二周年纪念，赋此志悼。
    熙州仲子负虚名，射虎将军右北平。
    夺笔江淹才是梦，衔须温序死犹生。
    当时霸气堪同调，薄海潮流要左倾。
    漫向苌弘愁化碧，兆民为重一身轻。
    五一节有感
    忍遣巴黎血史忘，茶花猩艳异蓝黄（注一）。
    百年战斗争前进，四海胪欢见报章。
    此日苏都真极乐，当时粤峤漫轻量（注二）。
    杜门习静惭吾拙，已见红潮涌海江。
    注一：传闻五一游行，肇始巴黎有男女两青年携白茶花随工人大队后，中间枪声忽作，两人皆受伤倒地，血染茶花成红色，逐成纪念云。
    注二：一九二六年五一节，为中国举行五一纪念首一次，余初至粤都，潜身群众中，听工人演讲，红旗招展，顾而乐之，距今已二十三年矣！
    五四纪念一首为辅仁大学附中奔流社赋。
    革命前驱忍淡忘，奇兵五四起苍黄。
    早窥猛进光明路，粉碎弥缝断烂章。
    落伍陈胡今已矣（注一），论功蔡李并难量
    （注二）。
    开天辟地今年好，已报红军过大江。
    注一：仲甫晚节不终，胡适更腼颜无耻，实为五四之玷。
    注二：谓孑民守常两先生。
