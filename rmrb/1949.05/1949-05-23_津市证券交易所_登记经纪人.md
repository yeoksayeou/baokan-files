　　Tianjin Securities Exchange
　　Registered Brokers
    [Our Dispatch] The preparatory work for the Tianjin Securities Exchange is largely complete, and various regulations have been officially drafted. It is stipulated that the 23rd and 24th will be the two days to handle the application registration of brokers. Brokers include legal person brokers (i.e., those based on groups) and individual brokers. During the preparation period of the exchange, in order to gather wisdom from all sources, symposiums were held separately for the industrial, banking, and securities industries to listen to the opinions of all parties as a reference for drafting various draft regulations. The currently drafted business rules, broker application methods, and broker business rules have been approved and implemented by the Tianjin Military Control Commission. Once the brokers are registered, trading can officially begin.
