    Accepting Readers' Opinions from This Newspaper
    Huolu Overcomes Bureaucracy
    [Chahar News] In order to improve leadership and effectively overcome bureaucracy, the Huolu County Party Committee has made unified regulations on the handling of mass appeals in newspapers, opinions from cadres and the masses, and issues raised by agencies and troops, in order to solve them quickly and improve work.
    Since September of last year, the People's Daily has forwarded many letters from the masses regarding issues such as class status and land disputes. Although they were all checked and handled, and the newspaper was replied to, the process was very slow, and there were few cases of sending people to directly investigate. The problems pointed out by the newspaper regarding attention to work (such as problems reflected in the conscription of Shi Jing) were also not seriously checked, and only perfunctory replies were given. In addition, as the masses' awareness has increased, they have frequently raised opinions on shortcomings in work and deviations in policy implementation, but the leadership has failed to handle them in a timely manner, and has even adopted delaying and indifferent attitudes. For example, Cao Yuzhen, a military dependent in Liangxiang, complained about unfair cultivation on her behalf by the village, and approached the county and district governments twice. The county government only wrote a letter to the lower level, and as a result, the problem was not solved because the village government was controlled by individual bad elements. It was not until the North China government issued a circular criticizing the situation that someone was sent to solve it. Similar phenomena exist. The reasons for these problems are mainly the leadership's carelessness, indifference to the suffering of the masses, rural-style bureaucracy, and the irresponsible liberal attitudes of some comrades, which have affected the rapid resolution of problems and the implementation of the Party's policies.
    In order to effectively overcome the above shortcomings, the following resolutions are made: (1) All letters from various agencies and newspapers reflecting the opinions of the masses and deviations in policy implementation shall be uniformly registered by the secretary of the County Party Committee. The County Party Committee shall assign people to handle them based on urgency, or instruct the District Party Committee to inspect them, conduct regular research, and earnestly solve them, and reply to the forwarding agency. (2) All opinions or letters directly submitted by cadres and the masses to the county's various agencies must be immediately submitted to the main person in charge of each agency for review and prompt handling. No department or section shall allow accumulation. (3) All accusations by the masses against Party member cadres for violating policies or dereliction of duty shall be handled by the Organization Department, which shall report to the County Party Committee regularly. (4) All cadres, after going to work in the villages, shall promptly reflect the opinions of the masses learned among the masses to the competent authorities in order to actively solve them. Finally, these regulations shall be conveyed to the cadres of various departments for conscientious implementation. (Hou Yong)

    接受本报读者意见
    获鹿克服官僚主义
    【察哈尔讯】获鹿县委为了改进领导有效的克服官僚主义，对报纸群众呼声、干部群众以及机关部队提出问题的处理，做了统一的规定，以期迅速的解决，改进工作。
    获鹿县自去年九月以来，群众为成份、土地纠纷等问题经人民日报社转来不少信件，虽都经过检查处理，答复了报社，但均甚为迟缓，且派人直接检查的较少。对报社转来之请工作中注意的问题（如反映石井参军中有毛病），亦未认真检查，只有被迫性的答复。另外，群众觉悟程度日益提高，对工作中的缺点，执行政策的偏差也经常提出意见，领导上未能及时处理，甚至采取了拖延与漠视态度，如果良厢军属曹玉振为村里代耕不公，曾找过县、区政府各两次，县政府仅给下级写了个信，结果因村政权为个别坏分子操纵仍未解决，一直到华北政府通令批评后，才派人解决了。类似现象还有。发生这些问题的原因，主要是领导上粗枝大叶、漠视群众痛苦、农村式的官僚主义，以及某些同志不负责任的自由主义态度，以致影响问题的迅速处理，影响党的政策贯彻。
    为了有效的克服以上缺点，特做出如下决议：（一）凡各机关、报社之转来群众反映，执行政策偏差等信件，一律由县委秘书统一登记，县委根据缓急，派人处理，或指示区委检查，定期研究，认真解决，并复来信机关。（二）凡干部、群众直接向本县各机关反映之意见或信件，必须立即交各机关主要负责人审阅，迅速处理，各部、科不得积压。（三）凡群众对党员干部违犯政策、渎职行为之告发，一律交组织部负责处理，定期向县委会报告。（四）所有干部到村工作后，在群众中了解之群众意见，迅速向主管机关反映，以便主动解决。最后把这些规定向各部门干部进行传达，以求认真贯彻。（侯永）
