Several Problems in Developing Production
狄超白 (Dí Chāobái)

(1) From Wartime to Peacetime

We are still continuing the war of liberation, and in terms of the manpower and material resources mobilized, it is unprecedented in scale. Therefore, war is still the priority now, and the demands of the war still occupy the dominant position. Although a complete victory is in sight, the war cannot be ended in a few months due to the vastness of China. Therefore, the people in the liberated areas will have to live frugally under the wartime economy for a period of time.

However, from another perspective, the war is progressing in its final stages. The Northeast and North China regions are far from the front lines, social order has gradually returned to normal, the reform of the old relations of production has been largely completed, production recovery and construction are underway in a stable state, and the new economic laws of the peacetime era are gradually being established and developed.

So, generally speaking, our North China and Northeast regions are in a transitional period from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. In this transition period, the relationship between the wartime economy and the peacetime economy is: on the one hand, the wartime economy is in a dominant position, hindering the establishment of the peacetime economy in the rear to some extent; but on the other hand, due to the victorious advance of the war, the establishment and development of the peacetime economy in the rear cannot be prevented in general. Moreover, the faster the peacetime economy in the rear is established, the more it can accelerate the arrival of a complete victory in the war.

(2) On Prices and Currency Value

In our war of liberation, we have used the development of production to curb the rate of price increases, and we have used streamlining and frugality to curb the rate of inflation. This is the main reason why we have been able to counter the advantage of the enemy with our disadvantage on the economic front and achieve victory. In our construction process in the future, we will continue to adhere to this policy, and basically stabilize prices and currency value by developing social material production and saving consumption, and then further suppress prices and increase currency value. But does this mean that when social production has not yet recovered and developed, we do not need to make efforts from other aspects to seek a relatively stable price and currency value? Of course not. On the contrary, precisely because we want to develop social production, we must do everything possible to make prices and currency values relatively stable in instability. The more we can make prices and currency values tend to stability, the more smoothly the laws of production development can proceed.

Then, before social production has been greatly developed, are there any conditions today that can make our prices and currency values tend to be relatively stable? The conditions are there: (1) The original social production institutions have gradually recovered under the correct industrial and commercial policies; (2) Domestic transportation has gradually opened up, and the market has gradually expanded; (3) The liberation of the Yangtze River basin will immediately have a beneficial impact on the markets of North China and Northeast China; (4) Foreign trade is gradually becoming smoother, and the raw materials and equipment necessary for industry are no longer acutely lacking; (5) Activities of social floating capital have begun to be cracked down and guided. These five conditions have a good effect on price stability. In addition, we have some other conditions today that also have a good effect on currency stability: (1) The further the military develops to the south, the burden on the old liberated areas will gradually be reduced; (2) Due to the recovery of industry and commerce in the old liberated areas, fiscal revenue is gradually increasing, gradually approaching a balance of payments; (3) Reasonable control of foreign trade can isolate external pressure on our currency value; (4) With the expansion of the liberated areas, the scope of circulation of the People's Currency is expanding daily, which can relatively reduce the amount of currency circulating in the old liberated areas.

The above conditions are the basis for us to make prices and currency values tend to be relatively stable at this stage. However, we must not, because we have these conditions, become complacent and neglect to prevent and combat other unfavorable factors and tendencies that still exist today. First, the war has not yet ended, and the expenditure of the war is still enormous; second, under the general policy of developing production, various production undertakings that have been destroyed in the war urgently need to be restored, so it is also possible that credit expansion may occur in one place or at one time, or that construction investment exceeds the limits that social material conditions can tolerate; third, the impact of floods and droughts on us; fourth, market floating capital still exists in a large amount, destroying the normal supply and demand of the market. These unfavorable factors and tendencies may offset the above favorable factors at any time, causing prices and currency values to stagnate in the trend of stability, or even causing sharp fluctuations, which in turn affects the progress of production and construction. So the question today is: how can we fully grasp and utilize those favorable conditions, while never neglecting the prevention and struggle against some unfavorable factors and tendencies? The answer is: we must first proceed under unified planning and centralized leadership, under the comprehensive care and overall allocation of various financial and economic departments and various liberated areas, in order to overcome difficulties and give full play to favorable conditions.

(3) Free Market and Supply and Marketing Organizations

The prevention and struggle against some unfavorable factors is mainly the handling of market problems. Our domestic market today is still a free market built on the basis of millions of small producers. In such a market, the laws of supply and demand are very easily destroyed. Especially after the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and the destruction of transportation in the war, as well as the blockade of the enemy and ourselves, the normal commercial organizations between urban and rural areas have long been destroyed. In addition, the military has not yet ended, so all supply and marketing routes have not yet been fully restored, and supply and marketing activities have not yet reached a sensitive and sound state.

The People's Government rarely interferes with the free market, and provides free development opportunities in transportation, finance, industry and commerce. The purpose is to quickly restore the exchange relations between urban and rural areas, restore the normal organization of the market, and enable the supply situation to be healthy. Generally speaking, all liberated areas have achieved considerable results, and are still developing along the path of progress.

However, the basic shortcoming of the free market is the blindness of the supply relationship. The law of supply and demand often pursues balance in a state of unbalanced supply. Moreover, due to the small capital of small producers and the seasonality of agricultural production, it is easy for commercial capitalists to carry out speculative activities. On the one hand, they exploit small producers, and on the other hand, they exploit urban consumers. The high price of grain during the period of crop failure is almost an exceptionless phenomenon every year.

The basic transformation of the free market is to strengthen state-owned trading institutions and establish a cooperative supply and marketing system in urban and rural areas. Only when the small producers and consumers in urban and rural areas are organized within the cooperative supply and marketing organizations can the blindness of supply and marketing relations be effectively overcome, the illegal exploitation of speculators can be eliminated, and the supply and demand status of the market can be permanently stable.

At present, we can seize the opportunity to develop urban and rural supply and marketing cooperatives, focusing on the purchase and sale of grain and on important goods that can be supplied by state-owned enterprises. The more rapidly and effectively this work is done today, the more decisive the role it will play in market prices. We must gradually make the distribution of the main means of livelihood in society fair and reasonable based on each individual's consumption power and purchasing power. At that time, the only problem will be the existence or quantity of a certain commodity, and the market will not fluctuate due to the imbalance of supply and demand of a certain commodity, thereby promoting the rise in general prices.

The difficulty today is that some abnormal activities have already occurred in the free market when we have not yet completed the work of cooperative supply and marketing organizations. The main factor of these abnormal activities is the large number of floating capital left over from the old society.

(4) The Problem of Floating Capital

During the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, malignant inflation caused the sudden enrichment of a few speculators, and caused many industrial capital to withdraw from production undertakings and transform into floating speculative capital. These speculators spend all day raising prices and increasing the burden of life for the general public as their ability, and their damage to the national economy and people's lives is incalculable. But these sins must be borne by the Kuomintang reactionaries, because under the laws of malignant inflation, the occurrence of such sinful behavior is inevitable. Therefore, when the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it did not liquidate these speculators. And called on them to develop production, giving them a way to start anew from a positive aspect. In the first two months after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, speculators had hidden their tracks for a while, so prices were kept in balance. However, in the recent month, due to the drought and the season of crop failure, speculators have begun to operate in the main sectors of various commodities. Based on their experience, they believe that this is the best opportunity to make a fortune. They have launched People's Currency to buy important necessities of life and gold foreign currency.

Some people believe that there are no large floating capital and large speculators in Tianjin and Beijing, which is not true. Tianjin and Beijing do not have an open modern speculative market, and the activities of speculators take diverse and decentralized forms. They launch cash one after another, exchange it for physical objects, and then increase the price day by day. We can also prove from the small amount of private deposits in banks in Tianjin and Beijing that the capital of the majority of floating capital owners is not in the form of currency but in the form of physical objects.

Larger speculators still hold gold, foreign currency and silver dollars as chips for their activities. Although the North China Liberated Area has ordered the prohibition of the circulation of these things, the black market still exists and is active. Artificially increasing the price of these things is enough to stimulate the rise in general prices.

Strengthening the crackdown on black market activities and strictly checking the movement and circulation of gold, silver and foreign currency are necessary measures to crack down on speculative activities. At the same time, we still adhere to the consistent position of being kind to others, and should continue to consider giving gold, silver and foreign currency holders a final opportunity to exchange it for People's Currency without loss, or deposit it in a bank, which can be used as self-provided foreign exchange.

The proper way out for floating capital is to invest in industrial and commercial enterprises, but speculators will never change their ways after a few admonitions. In the near future, they will be taught a lesson in reality: when the grain from the Northeast enters the customs in a steady stream, and when Shanghai and Hankou are liberated, the material exchange between inside and outside the customs, Central China and North China will be unimpeded, which will inevitably cause serious blows to speculators. At that time, they will realize the unreliability of past experience. Then they will begin to consider the government's advice and gradually embark on the right path.

　　发展生产中的几个问题
    狄超白
　　（一）从战时过渡到平时
    现在我们还在继续解放战争，且就所动员的人力物力而论，其规模之大是空前的。因此，现在还是战争第一，战争的要求仍居于主要的支配地位：虽然全面胜利在握，但因中国地区辽阔，战事非几个月之内所能结束；所以解放区人民还得在战时经济的支配下，刻苦生活一个时期。
    然而从另一角度来看，战争是在结束的阶段中进展。东北华北地区，已远离战线，社会秩序已逐渐恢复平时状态，旧生产关系的改革大体上已经初步完成，生产的恢复与建设已在安定的状态中进行，和平时期的新经济规律，也已经逐步的建立，逐步的发展了。
    所以一般地说来，我们华北东北地区，是处于从战时经济走向平时经济的过渡期中。在这过渡期中，战时经济与平时经济的关系是：一方面，战时经济既处于主要支配的地位，多多少少在阻碍着后方平时经济的建立；但另一方面，由于战争的胜利前进，一般的也不能阻止后方平时经济的建立和发展。而且，后方平时经济的愈迅速建立，愈能加速战争的全面胜利的到来。
　　（二）关于物价和币值
    我们在解放战争中，曾以发展生产来阻遏了物价上涨的速率，曾以精简节约来阻遏了通货膨胀的速率。这就是在经济战线上，所以能以劣势对抗优势，而获得胜利的主要原因。我们今后在建设过程中，仍将秉此方针，基本上要从社会物质生产的发展和消费的节约去稳定物价和币值，再进而抑低物价和提高币值。但是不是说：当社会的生产还未能恢复和发展的时候，我们就不需要从其他方面去努力，以求物价和币值的比较稳定呢？当然不是的。刚刚相反，正因为要发展社会的生产，还得尽一切可能，使物价和币值在不稳定中求得相对的稳定。我们愈能使物价和币值趋向稳定，就愈能使生产发展的规律圆滑进行。
    那末，当社会的生产还未能大量发展之先，今天有没有一些条件，可以使我们的物价和币值趋于相对的稳定呢？条件是有的：（一）社会原有的生产机构，在正确的工商政策之下，已经逐渐的恢复起来；（二）国内交通已逐渐开畅，市场已逐渐扩大；（三）长江流域的解放，对华北东北的市场立即会引起有利的影响；（四）对外贸易渐畅，工业所必需的原料器材不再感到尖锐的缺乏；（五）对社会游资的活动已开始予以取缔疏导。以上这五个条件，对于物价的稳定，都是有良好作用的。此外，我们今天还有其他一些条件，对于通货的稳定，也有良好的作用：（一）军事愈向南发展，老解放区的负担会逐步的减轻下来；（二）老解放区因工商业的恢复，财政收入渐增，逐步的接近于收支平衡；（三）对外贸易的合理控制，可以隔绝外力对我币值的压力；（四）解放地区扩大，人民券的流通范围日广，可使老解放区内通货底流通数量相对的减少。
    以上这些条件，就是我们在现阶段能够使物价和币值趋于相对稳定的根据。然而，我们决不能够，因为具备了这些条件，我们就不足忧虑，就忽略了对今天还存在的其他不利因素和不利倾向的防阻。第一，战争尚未结束，战争的开支仍然浩大；第二，在发展生产的总方针下，在战争中受到破坏的各种生产事业急待恢复，因此也可能在一时一地发生信用的膨胀，或者是建设投资超过社会物质条件所能容许的限度；第三，水旱灾荒对于我们的打击；第四，市场游资仍然宠大地存在着，同隙破坏市场的正常供需。以上这些不利因素和不利倾向，随时可能抵销以上的有利因素，而使物价和币值在稳定的趋向中停顿下来，甚或发生激烈的波动；结果影响到生产建设的进行。所以今天的问题是：我们如何能把那些有利条件充分把握运用，同时决不忽视对一些不利因素和不利倾向的防范和斗争呢？回答是：我们首先要在统盘计划和集中领导之下，要在各种财经部门和各个解放区的全面照顾和全面调配之下，才能进行克服困难和发挥有利条件的工作。
　　（三）自由市场与供销组织
    对于一些不利因素的防范和斗争，主要的是对于市场的处理问题。我们今天的国内市场，还是建立在千百万小生产基础之上的自由市场。这样的市场，供需规律非常容易破坏，尤其经过国民党反动政权的长期统治，和在战争中交通的破坏，以及敌我的封锁，早已使城乡间的正常商业组织受到破坏，加之军事还未结束，所以一切供销路线尚未完全恢复，供销活动尚未达到灵敏而健全的境地。
    人民政府对于自由市场很少予以干涉，并且在交通运输金融工商各方面，予以自由发展的机会；其目的，就是要迅速恢复城乡的交换关系，使市场的正常组织复原，供应状态能够健全起来。一般而论，各解放区都已获得相当成效，而且仍在沿着进步的道路发展。
    但是自由市场底基本缺点，是供应关系的盲目性。供求律经常在供应不平衡的状态中去追求平衡。而且，由于小生产者资本的短小，和农业生产的季节性，容易使商业资本家进行投机行为，他们一方面剥削小生产者，一方面剥削城市消费者。在青黄不接时期的粮价高涨，几乎是历年无例外的现象。
    从基本上改造自由市场，是要加强国营贸易机构，及建立城乡底合作供销系统。只有等将城乡的小生产者与消费者组织在合作供销机构之内的时候，才能有效克服供销关系的盲目性，才能免除投机商人的非法剥削，才能使市场的供需状态永远平稳。
    目前可以把握时机，以粮食的购销为中心，以国营企业所能供给的重要物品为中心，发展城乡的供销合作社。今天这一工作愈做得迅速有效，愈能对市场的价格问题发生决定的作用。我们要逐步地使社会主要生活资料的分配，根据各个人的消费力和购买力，做到公平而合理。那时，问题只会是某一种商品的有无或多少，而不会因某一种商品的供销失调，市场就引起波动，从而促成一般物价的上涨。
    今天的困难是：当我们还没有完成合作供销组织这一工作的时候，自由市场上已经发生一些不正常的活动，这些不正常活动的主要因素，乃是旧社会遗留下来的大批脱离生产的游资在作祟。
  　（四）游资问题
    在国民党反动统治时代，恶性膨胀造成了少数投机者的暴富，并使许多产业资本退出生产事业，转变为游离的投机资本。这些投机者终日以抬高物价，增加一般人民的生活负担为能事，其对于国民经济和人民生活的损害是无法估计的。但这些罪恶，都要国民党反动派去负责，因为在恶性膨胀的规律下，这种罪恶行为的产生是必然的。所以当人民解放军进驻城市的时候，对这些投机者并没有予以清算。而且以发展生产号召他们，从积极方面给予自新之路。平津解放后的最初两个月内，投机者曾敛迹一时，故物价得保持平衡。然而最近一个月以来，因天时的亢旱和青黄不接的季节，投机者已开始在各种商品的主要部门活动了，他们凭借经验，认为这是最好的发财机会，他们纷纷推出人民券，购买重要生活必需品和黄金外币。
    有人认为平津没有大游资和大投机家，这是不确实的。平津没有公开的现代化的投机市场，投机者的活动是采取分散的多种多样的方式。他们纷纷推出现款，换成实物，然后逐日涨价。我们从平津两地私人在银行的存款之少，也可以证明广大游资所有者的资本，不是货币形态而是实物形态。
    较大的投机家，仍然掌握着黄金、外币和银元为活动的筹码。华北解放区虽已通令禁止这些东西流通，但黑市仍然存在，而且活跃，人为的提高了这些东西的价格，就足以刺激一般物价的上涨。
    加强取缔黑市的活动，严厉检查金银外币的移动和流通，乃是取缔投机活动所不可少的措施。同时，我们仍本与人为善的一贯立场，应继续考虑给金银外币的持有人一个最后的机会，使它能在不受损失的条件下，兑换人民券，或者存入银行，而可以当作自备外汇来使用。
    游资的正当出路，是投资于工商事业，但投机家决不会听几句劝告而就改弦更辙。在最近的将来，他们将会在现实中受到教训：当东北的粮食源源入关，以及上海汉口解放的时候，关内关外华中华北的物资交流就畅通无阻，必然会使投机家遭受严重的打击，那时他们才会觉悟到旧时经验之不可靠。然后才会开始考虑政府的劝告而逐渐步入正途。
