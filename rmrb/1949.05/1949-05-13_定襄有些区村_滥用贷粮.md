    [Jinzhong Electric] The Dingxiang County branch of the People's Bank of China, during an inspection of agricultural loans, discovered serious abuses of grain loans. The county government has instructed all districts and villages to quickly rectify this. The Dingxiang County branch of the People's Bank of China, during its agricultural loan inspection in March, discovered that many village cadres, without approval from higher authorities, had arbitrarily used loan grain and inventory grain, seriously affecting the policy of organized production and lending. According to county-wide statistics, districts and villages privately used a total of 6,345 catties of loan grain and inventory grain. Some of this was used to purchase livestock, but some was not used for production at all. According to available information, 594 catties of grain were used for simple relief and administrative expenses. For example, Yaquan Village in the Fourth District used 70 catties of loan grain (soybeans) to make tofu and eat it. Chengguan West used 150 catties of loan grain for village office expenses. Village cadres in Zhao Jia Zhuang Village in the Fourth District used 150 catties of loan grain to pay teachers' salaries. In order to ensure that loans are used for production in a planned and organized manner, and to implement the agricultural loan policy, the Dingxiang County government issued instructions to all districts and villages on March 30, demanding a prompt inspection and correction of the above-mentioned abuse of grain loans. The government pointed out that this is a serious act of disorganization and anarchy, which should be severely criticized. The abused loan grain should be returned to the original warehouse quickly. In the future, without the bank's authorization, no department or cadre is allowed to use loan grain or loans.

    定襄有些区村
    滥用贷粮
    【晋中电】人民银行定襄县支行，检查农贷，发现严重的滥用贷粮现象，县政府已指示各区、村迅速纠正。人民银行定襄县支行于三月份检查农业贷款时，发现不少村干部未经上级批准，擅自动用贷粮与库存，严重影响了有组织地进行生产与贷款的方针。据全县的统计，各区村私自动用贷粮及库存粮共达六千三百四十五斤，其中除用于购买牲畜者外，有些根本未用于生产。据现有材料的了解，即有五百九十四斤粮用于单纯救济及行政开支。如四区窑泉村动用贷粮黄豆七十斤做豆腐吃了；城西关用贷粮一百五十斤，作了村公所的开支，四区赵家庄村干部动用一百五十斤贷粮，支付了教员的薪金。定襄县政府为保证贷款有计划有组织地用于生产，贯彻农贷方针，于三月三十日指示各区、村迅速检查纠正以上滥支贷粮现象，指出此系严重的无组织无政府行为，应受到严重的批评，将已滥支的贷粮迅速归还原库，今后不经银行，任何部门与干部均不准动用贷粮、贷款。
