Jinan, Hebei, 6th Dispatch—The CPC Jinan Second Prefectural Committee conscientiously implemented the Central Committee's resolution on building the League. It concentrated 64 youth work cadres, focusing on Wucheng County, to create experience. As of May 4th, in the past month, six League branches have been established in six villages, including Songtang Village, with 77 League members recruited. Preparatory work for building the League has been done in 20 villages. Initial experiences gained are as follows: First, building the League must be closely integrated with the central task. In villages like He Moumou's, the initiative was taken to mobilize young men and women to actively participate in production. Then, through the branch, propaganda and education were conducted among young activists. This met the demands of the masses and gained their support, enabling the League building work to proceed smoothly. Conversely, in Xiniu Village, the integration with production was neglected. The masses reflected, "The cadres who came to our village only care about the Youth League, not about production." As a result, neither League building nor production was done well. Second, full publicity and deliberation are crucial for the success or failure of League building. Because League building is a new issue, cadres, party members, and the masses have ideological concerns. The general public fears being transferred elsewhere, being asked to have their children take the lead in joining the army, and being asked to replace veteran cadres; they also fear production problems, chaotic male-female relationships, and young people becoming unmanageable. The propaganda, explanation, and persuasive education to address these ideological concerns must grasp certain elements. First, it must be fully explained within and outside the Party that participating in the army and the war is the duty of every citizen, and that building the League and joining the army are two different things. Then, the purpose, significance, and nature of League building must be explained. In Songtang Village, individual propaganda was first conducted among branch members and village cadres, and then deliberation was carried out among prospective members. Only after it was mature was public propaganda and mobilization carried out, which resulted in a smooth process. Conversely, in villages like Xiniu Village, deliberation was not thorough or extensive, leading party members to adopt a perfunctory attitude. Third, League members should be developed in accordance with the Party Constitution, and the method of simply "roping in" should be opposed. Because some cadres have a task-oriented mindset and personal vanity, they become anxious when they see that other villages have established the League, so they still develop a simple and hasty habit of "roping in", which reduces the organizational role of the League. Fourth, it is necessary to consciously and systematically remove feudal elements that hinder young people from participating in political, economic, and cultural activities, especially to remove the feudal family's blockade against young men and women. However, this is an internal problem of the peasantry and must be solved from within. First, mobilize young people to actively participate in production to improve their family status; then strengthen youth education to raise their awareness. But it must be recognized that this is a long-term, arduous mobilization and education effort, and it must never be rushed.

    结合生产建团
    武城获得初步经验
    【冀南六日电】中共冀南二地委会切实执行中央建团决议，曾集中青年工作干部六十四人，以武城为重点县，创造经验。截至五月四日止，一月来在宋唐庄等六村建立团支部六个，发展团员七十七名，做好二十个村的建团准备工作。并取得初步经验如下：第一、建团必须与中心任务密切结合，何某某等村首先号召青年男女积极参加生产，然后经过支部在青年积极分子中进行宣传教育、这样适合了群众要求，得到群众拥护，建团工作得以顺利开展；相反的，西牛庄忽视了结合生产，群众反映：“上俺村来的干部光管青年团的事，不管生产。”结果建团与生产均没作好。第二、充分宣传酝酿、是建团成败的决定关键。因为建团是个新问题，干部、党员、群众都有思想顾虑，一般群众怕往外调、怕叫子第带头参军、怕叫顶替老干部；还怕生产、怕男女关系乱、怕青年不受管教等。对这些思想顾虑的宣传解释说服教育，必须掌握一定分子，首先在党内外充分说明参军参战是每个公民应尽的义务，建团与参军是两回事。然后说明建团目的、意义及时的性质等，宋唐庄先在支部、村干中个别宣传分子，然后到会员对象中进行酝酿，待成熟后再公开宣传动员，结果很顺利，相反西牛庄等村酝酿不深入不广泛，致使党员抱应付敷衍态度。第三、按照党章发展团员，反对单拉夫办法。因为有的干部思想上存有任务观点及个人虚荣心，见到别的村把团建立起来，自己就着急，所以还产生简单拉夫的急性病，结果降低了团的组织作用。第四、必须有意识有步骤地解除阻碍青年参加政治、经济、文化活动的封建东西，特别解除封建家庭对青年男女的封锁。但这是农民内部的问题，要从内部解决，首先发动青年积极参加生产，提高他们的家庭地位；然后加强青年教育提高觉悟，但必须认识这是长期的坚苦动员教育工作，绝不能操之过急。
