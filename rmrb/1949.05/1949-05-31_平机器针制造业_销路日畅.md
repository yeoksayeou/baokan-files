Following the liberation of Peiping, private machine needle manufacturing factories such as Zhongyuan, Jiuxin, Yongmao, and Jianbei actively resumed production. As urban-rural relations gradually returned to normal, sales increased daily. Zhongyuan Needle Factory, which manufactures various complex machine needles for socks, sewing, and overlocking, now produces 10,000 dozen per month. Jiuxin Needle Factory produces 3,000 dozen per month. Yongmao Needle Factory, specializing in sewing machine needles, now produces 1,200 dozen per month, and Jianbei Factory produces 500 dozen per month. The finished products of these factories were once sold as far as Baotou, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Jinan, and Kaifeng. Later, due to transportation difficulties, sales declined. Now that North China has been completely liberated, transportation has been restored, the market has expanded, and sales have increased, leading to renewed development. Note: Machine needles have a complex structure, with sock needles requiring 46 processing steps. Moreover, the various machines for making needles cannot be manufactured domestically. Therefore, there are only about ten machine needle factories in the entire North China region, located in Yantai, Tianjin, Peiping, Jinan, and other places. Therefore, this industry has excellent prospects for development. (Ming)

　　平机器针制造业
  　销路日畅
    【本报讯】北平解放后私营机器针制造厂中原、久信、永茂、建北等，积极恢复生产，并因城乡关系逐步恢复正常，销路日畅。制造织袜，缝纫、缝口等各种复杂机器针的中原针厂现在每月生产一万打，久信针厂每月生产三千打。专制造缝纫机器针的永茂针厂现在每月生产一千二百打，建北工厂每月生产五百打。各厂成品曾远销包头、张家口、太原、济南、开封各地。后因交通困难，销路日衰，现华北获得全部解放，交通恢复，市场扩大，销路增加，重新获得发展。按：机器针构造复杂，织袜针需加工四十六道手续，而且造针的各种机器本国都不会制造，故机器针厂在全华北仅烟台、天津、北平、济南等地有，总共不过十家，故该业极有发展的前途。  　　　　　　　（鸣）
