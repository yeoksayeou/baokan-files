New Plans for U.S. Imperialist Colonial Expansion (Continued)
By V. Lutsky
Translated by Yang Fu

In September 1945, Sinclair Oil Company obtained a concession in Abyssinia. In 1947, the United States approved a $3 million loan to this country. American companies have already monopolized air traffic between Abyssinia and other countries. Various departments of the Abyssinian government are guided by American advisors. The American financier and oil tycoon Rockefeller recently visited this country.

Dollar imperialism has long openly declared its plans for colonial expansion in other countries and the subordination of semi-colonial states. The new Truman Plan contains nothing new. It is an attempt to strengthen and greatly expand the existing competition of American expansionists in the colonial world.

The purpose of this plan is not only to open up new areas for investment by American monopoly capital and sources of colonial high profits, but also to seize strategic raw material resources from the colonies of European countries.

Last autumn, the Strategic Resources Department of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration sent its experts to British colonies to seek new raw material resources. This plan emerged under the guise of American aid to Britain in developing its colonies, as a program of "joint" development of British colonial resources. These negotiations have been going on until recently. American representatives insisted that American capital should be allowed free access to British colonies, pointing out that their raw material resources were being used inappropriately, and that the recovery of the European economy required them to be developed more intensively.

◇ ◇ ◇

It is clear that the plan for the expansion of American capital into the colonies of other countries and the nominally independent countries of Asia and Africa has very clear practical purposes. But the authors of this plan are eager to conceal their greed. They talk about their "civilizing mission" and the need to "develop" backward countries, which, in other words, is the verbose nonsense that the representatives of "old imperialism" are accustomed to using in this situation.

In Bevan's speech, which enthusiastically praised the Truman Plan, he admitted that Britain had brought nothing but poverty to the people of its colonies. But he expressed his hope that "with the help of American capital, the colonial people will achieve a good standard of living and happiness."

The advocates of American colonial expansion shamelessly say that they intend to raise the living standards of the colonial people in order to prevent them from leaning towards communism.

In this situation, the desire for world hegemony, like a slave, follows in the footsteps of its despicable and defeated predecessors, using a discredited "anti-communism" flag as a smokescreen for their pursuit of world hegemony. But behind these hypocritical arguments, the serious panic of imperialism has been revealed by the rapid development of democratic forces in the colonies and dependent countries.

A striking example of the "civilized" Americans bestowing "happiness" on the people of backward regions is proven by the astonishing exploitation of workers by the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) in Saudi Arabia.

Aramco workers have only eight days of vacation a year. They live in small huts made of mud and palm leaves, and even the company's pathetic accommodations take years to build. In 1947, the company made a profit of $60 million, while the total annual wages of its 20,000 workers were only one-tenth of this amount. Barbaric medieval practices are diligently cultivated by the American "civilized people" in Arabia. Slave trading is still prevalent in the concession area. Workers are flogged for listening to music, watching movies, or enjoying any other civilized benefits. In the concession area, the appalling practice of cutting off the hands of "lawbreakers" has not changed, the United States has merely "civilized" the medieval punishment. Now the killing knife is sterilized in the sterilizer of the Aramco hospital, and an American surgeon can sew up the hand of a victim.

Aramco workers are under police surveillance. Anyone who expresses dissatisfaction will be beaten or fired. Unions are prohibited in the concession area. The labor movement is accused.

In the Philippines, an American colony decorated with the name "independence," the laboring people are exploited like animals.

The policies implemented by American monopoly capital in Latin America are also world-renowned. Dollar imperialism relies on ruthless exploitation in order to extract super-profits from the people of these countries. The hands and feet of Latin American countries are bound by the economic and political chains of Wall Street.

American monopoly capital, in promoting so-called "charity" and under the guise of new plans for spreading American "civilization," is now invading all the colonies of the world.

It is foreseeable that this plan will encounter obstacles in the state of sharp conflict between the desires of American expansionists and the interests of other colonial countries. Bevan is ready to carry out Wall Street's orders, but this does not eliminate the sharp conflict of interests that certainly exists between the partners of the Anglo-American bloc.

This plan will also encounter the stubborn resistance of the oppressed people of Asia and Africa, whose national self-awareness has grown greatly in the post-war years. U.S. imperialism, in its further policy of colonial expansionism, strives to exploit these people and destroy their national liberation movements. The brutal oppression of U.S. imperialism will further increase their dissatisfaction, thus strengthening their firm determination to fight, and thus further exacerbating the general crisis of capitalism and the colonial system.

    美帝殖民地扩张的新计划（续完）
    Ｖ·卢特斯基原作
    杨甫译
    一九四五年九月，莘克莱煤油公司在阿比西尼亚获得一个特许权。一九四七年，美国批准给这个国家以三百万美元的借款。美国公司已经垄断了阿比西尼亚和别国的航空交通。阿比西尼亚政府的各部门，受美国顾问的指导。美国财政家和煤油大王的洛克菲勒，最近访问过这个国家。
    金元帝国主义早已公开了它在其他国家的殖民地及在半殖民地的附属国的扩张计划。新的杜鲁门计划，到底没有新的东西。这是企图加强和大大地扩展现存的美国扩张主义者对殖民地世界的竞争。
    这个计划的目的，不仅是为美国垄断资本投资和殖民地高利润的源泉开辟了新的范围；而且是要占有欧洲各国殖民地的战略原料资源。
    去年秋天，美国经济合作总署的战略资源部，派出它的专家到英国殖民地去，探寻新的原料资源。这个计划，是在美国援助英国发展它的殖民地、当作一个“联合”开发英殖民地资源的纲领的外衣之下出现的。这个谈判的进行一直到最近。美国代表坚持着：美国资本应被准许自由进出于英殖民地，他们指出，他们的原料资源是不适当地被使用着，欧洲经济的恢复，要求着他们必须更加紧张地开发。
      ◇      ◇      ◇
    由此可见，为了美国资本扩张深入其他国家的殖民地和亚洲非洲名义上独立的国家的计划，是有很明确的实际目的。但这个计划的作者却亟图掩盖着他的贪欲。他们谈论着他们的“文明的任务”和“发展”落后国家之必要，换句话说，这就是“旧帝国主义”的代表们，在这种情况中所惯用的冗赘的妄语。
    在贝文这样热情地赞美杜鲁门计划的演讲中，他承认：英国带给他的殖民地人民的，除了贫穷之外，没有别的东西。但是他表示出他的希望说：“由于美国资本的帮助，殖民地人民将得到生活和幸福的好标准”。
    美国殖民地扩张的拥护者，毫不知耻的说：他们为了防止殖民地人民倾向于共产主义起见，有意提高他们的生活标准。
    在这种情况中，对世界霸权的热望，象奴隶一般，跟着他们的卑鄙地失败了先辈的步调，用着一面没有信用的“反共产主义”的旗子，作为他们追逐世界霸权的烟幕。但是在这些虚伪的争辩后面，帝国主义的严重的惊慌，已为殖民地和附属国大踏步地发展着的民主力量所揭露。
    美国的“文明人”恩赐落后地区的人民“幸福”的显著例子，被沙特阿拉伯的阿、美煤油公司阿蓝哥分公司对工人惊人的剥削给予证明了。
    阿蓝哥分公司的工人，一年只有八天的休假日。他们住的是用泥土和棕叶缀成的小茅舍，甚至可怜的公司住所，也需几年时间才能建筑起来。一九四七年，公司获得六千万美元的利润，而它的二万工人全年的工资，仅及这个总数的十分之一。野蛮的中世纪的惯例，被在阿拉伯的美国“文明人”孜孜地所养成。在特许地区，奴隶买卖还盛行着。工人听音乐，看电影，或享受一点点任何其他文明利益，就要被鞭笞。在特许地区里，砍掉“法律破坏者”的手的惊人的实施，仍然没有改变，美国只是把中世纪的刑罚加以“文明化”了。现在用来杀人的屠刀，是放在阿蓝哥医院的消毒器里消过毒，而一个美国外科医生，可以把一个被害者的手缝好。
    阿蓝哥的工人，是在警察的监视之下。任何表示不满的人，就要被打击或开除工作。在特许区职工会是被禁止的。工人运动是被控告的。
    在装饰着“独立”名义的美国殖民地的菲律宾，劳动人民好象畜生一样被剥削着。
    美国垄断资本，在拉丁美洲所实行的政策，也是举世闻名的。金元帝国主义，为了从这些国家人民身上榨取超额利润，而依赖无情的剥削。拉丁美洲各国的手脚，被华尔街的经济的和政治的锁链所束缚着。
    美国垄断资本，在推进所谓“慈善事业”中，在为着传播美国“文明”的新计划的伪装之下，现在正向外侵入世界所有的殖民地。
    这是可以预料的，这个计划，将遭遇到在美国的扩张主义者的欲望和其他殖民地国家利益之尖锐冲突的状态中的障碍。贝文准备去完成华尔街的命令，但这并不能消除英美集团的伙伴之间所确切存在的尖锐的利益矛盾。
    这个计划，又将遭遇到亚洲和非洲被压迫人民之顽强的抵抗，他们的民族自觉，在战后的几年中已非常地增长。美帝国主义在它的殖民地扩张主义者政策的更进一步中，努力剥削这些人民，和摧残他们的民族解放运动。美帝国主义的残酷压榨，将更增加他们的不满，因而也加强了他们坚定的斗争决心，由此也更进而加剧了资本主义和殖民地制度的总危机。（译自一九四九年三月二日莫斯科：新时代周刊第十期）
