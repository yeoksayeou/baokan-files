　　Tianjin Military Control Commission Orders Banks and Chambers of Commerce to Expedite the Handling of Purchased and Stored Materials

    [Tianjin News] The Financial Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission issued instructions on the 18th to the Tianjin Banks and Chambers of Commerce, ordering all member firms to complete the handling of materials purchased and stored in past unofficial accounts before the end of May. The instructions stated: "After the liberation, all materials held by various banks and firms were previously ordered to be reported and registered, with state-accumulated materials merged into prior accounts and approved for sale. However, the majority have not yet complied with the sales order. Now that the Interim Measures for the Administration of Private Silver and Money Industries in the North China Region have been promulgated, the operations of banks and firms urgently need to be rectified; moreover, with capital increases imminent, it is necessary to clear these materials as preparation. All materials purchased and stored in past unofficial accounts by various banks and firms, except for properties recognized by the People's Bank as being eligible to offset capital, must be completely handled before the end of May, and handled in accordance with the relevant regulations on the handling of materials purchased and stored in unofficial accounts issued by the Financial Department."
