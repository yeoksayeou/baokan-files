　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 26th: TASS, Paris: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky delivered a speech on the 24th at the Foreign Ministers' Conference discussing the issue of "German unification, including economic principles, political principles, and Allied control." The text is as follows:

　　This is not the first time that the representatives of the four powers have faced the issue of Germany's economic and political unification. As early as the wartime Yalta Conference, the leaders of the three countries focused their main attention on this issue. At that time, when formulating their policy towards Germany, they took the destruction of German militarism and Nazism and the creation of guarantees that Germany would no longer be able to disrupt world peace as their important historical tasks. The leaders of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom then acknowledged that the solution to the fate of Hitler's Germany was only possible on the basis of the aforementioned program. Later, France also joined this program.

　　We all know that this happened on the eve of the defeat of Hitler's Germany. Two months later, at the Potsdam Conference -- at which time Germany had already surrendered -- the Allies reached new agreements on the economic and political principles of a common policy towards Germany. The Potsdam Conference, starting from the recognition of Germany as a single political and economic unit, declared that the main objective of the four powers' policy towards Germany was to rebuild Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis; this was particularly reflected in the Potsdam Conference's decision to establish a number of German administrative departments headed by state secretariats.

　　From this, it is clear that the victorious nations at the Potsdam Conference had already correctly recognized that they should treat Germany as a single economic and political whole; only by adhering to the principle of Germany's economic and political unification can the tasks that the leaders of the four governments set for themselves in their policy towards Germany be achieved. This policy must guarantee the eradication of German militarism and fascism; it must guarantee the development of Germany's peaceful industry, agriculture, and the entire German national economy; it must guarantee the development of Germany's domestic and foreign trade, and economic relations between Germany and other countries. This is conducive to meeting the needs and peaceful demands of the German people and fulfilling their obligations to the Allies.

　　Further development of the aforementioned principles of policy towards Germany is reflected in the decisions of the Fourth Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in 1947. At that time, the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union concluded that it was necessary to prepare measures to establish a provisional all-German government. I emphasize the all-German government. This conclusion is in line with the principle of Germany's political unification adopted at the Potsdam Conference, and it is a concrete practice of this principle.

　　The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference had detailed provisions regarding the powers of the future German central government, emphasizing that this government "has the power to take legislative and administrative measures to ensure the necessary unification," and further pointed out that this refers to political unification, economic unification, financial unification, and legal unification. The delegations of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States stipulated that the central government has the power to govern issues such as: the issuance of banknotes and coins, the allocation of banking activities, taxation, the control of exports, imports, and foreign exchange, foreign trade, and customs duties. In addition, the delegations of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom stipulated that the German central government also has the power to govern the following issues: the control of grain delivery, the distribution of scarce food and raw materials, the control of labor conditions, wages, and prices, as well as other issues that are important to all of Germany.

　　The European Advisory Commission agreed on the German control mechanism. According to this agreement, the supreme power to control all issues concerning the entire Germany should be jointly exercised by the Allied Commanders-in-Chief of the occupation zones in Germany, and the four Commanders-in-Chief should form a supreme control organ called the Control Council to exercise this power. The tasks of the Control Council are as follows: 1. To ensure appropriate coordination of the actions of the Commanders-in-Chief in their respective occupation zones; 2. To draft plans on major military, political, economic and other issues common to the whole of Germany and to obtain unanimous decisions on these issues; 3. To control the central administrative institutions of Germany; 4. To guide the administration of "Greater Berlin" through the relevant competent authorities. These are the four main aspects of the problem. They make the Control Council shoulder clear responsibilities. From this, it can be seen that the entire function of the Control Council is used to implement the demilitarization and democratization of Germany, to facilitate the reconstruction of Germany into a single, democratic, and peace-loving country. Throughout the period of the Control Council's activities, the Soviet government has always unswervingly strived to achieve these tasks. It is correct to regard the activities of the Control Council, organized in accordance with the above-mentioned tasks, as a basic condition for preventing the danger of the revival of German aggression, for the democratic construction of Germany, and for satisfying the legitimate demands of the Allies who have suffered from German aggression.

　　The Soviet Union's attitude on the issue of German reparations is well known.

　　However, the Foreign Ministers' Conference has so far failed to reach a unanimous decision on all these issues.

　　The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have taken the path of three-power decisions and three-power measures, which is clearly contrary to the previous decisions on the German issue by the four powers of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France. The plan to establish a West German government is one of these measures. This plan is designed to determine the division of Germany and to oppose West Germany to the rest of Germany. The decisions on the basic principles of merging the West German occupied zones, the decisions on the West German occupation regulations, and the trilateral agreement on the establishment of the Ruhr Control Bureau, which were adopted by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France in Washington in April of this year, all pursue the same purpose.

　　As early as the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet government suggested that the Ruhr industrial area, as an indivisible part of Germany, must be jointly controlled by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France. The Soviet government then suggested establishing a special Allied commission for the Ruhr industrial area for a certain period of time, composed of representatives of the aforementioned four countries. The Soviet Union's attitude on this matter is well known, and I am not prepared to say more about it. The Soviet government has attached and will continue to attach great importance to the Ruhr issue. The Soviet government has always believed that it is not right for the Ruhr, which is extremely important in military and industrial terms, not to be subject to international control based on the four powers. The following fact is also incorrect: that the German Control Council cannot consider and resolve issues related to the Ruhr, especially the fact that the committee cannot control the production and distribution of coal and iron, which plays a decisive role in the entire German economy. Organizing an international Ruhr control institution composed of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union (whose representatives participate in the Allied commission that advises on the production and distribution of Ruhr products) and the representatives of the six countries bordering Germany that are particularly interested in the German issue, namely Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, as well as the representatives of German economic institutions, would be a means of ensuring appropriate international control over the Ruhr industrial area.

　　The Soviet delegation currently does not elaborate on all the measures taken by Western countries regarding West Germany, especially regarding the Ruhr, because the Soviet government's attitude towards these issues has been fully explained and is well known. It believes that it must reiterate its position on these measures and declare again that these measures run counter to the interests of the peace and security of the European people.

　　The Soviet government has advocated in the past and still advocates the establishment of Germany's economic and political unity. The Soviet government has strived to ensure that the Control Council follows this direction in its actions. The Control Council is responsible for exercising the supreme power in Germany during the occupation period and ensuring the realization of Germany's demilitarization and democratization, and ensuring its reconstruction into a single, peace-loving, and democratic country.

　　In concluding my speech, I submit the following specific proposals of the Soviet delegation to the Foreign Ministers' Conference:

　　(1) In order to ensure the economic and political unity of Germany:

　　A. Restore the activities of the Control Council for Germany on the previous basis, as the institution responsible for exercising supreme power in Germany.

　　B. Restore the Allied Joint Command in Berlin to coordinate measures to manage the entire city of Berlin and ensure the normal life of the entire city of Berlin.

　　(2) At the same time, given that it is impossible to implement Germany's economic and political unity without establishing a single German central institution, it is therefore recognized that it is necessary to:

　　A. Establish an all-German State Council on the basis of the existing economic institutions in the eastern and western occupied zones.

　　B. Restore the Berlin City Council. The date of the election of the Berlin City Council will be considered by the Allied Command in Berlin.

### 关于德国统一问题　维辛斯基发表演说

　　关于德国统一问题
  　维辛斯基发表演说
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：苏外长维辛斯基于二十四日在外长会议讨论“德国的统一包括经济原则政治原则和盟国管制”问题时发表演说，原文如下：
    四国代表面对德国经济政治统一问题，这并不是第一次。还在战时雅尔塔会议的时候，三国领袖就曾把他们的主要注意力放在这个问题上。当时，他们在制定他们的对德政策时，就以摧毁德国的军国主义和纳粹主义，创造使德国不再能扰乱世界和平的保证为自己的重要历史任务。苏、美、英三国政府领袖当时承认，希特勒德国的命运问题之解决，只在上述纲领的基础上才有可能。后来，法国也参加了这个纲领。
    我们大家都知道，这是在希特勒德国战败前夕的事情。过了两个月，在波茨坦会议上--这时德国已经投降了，盟国在对德共同政策的经济政治原则上取得了新的协议。波茨坦会议从承认德国是一个单一的政治经济单位出发，宣布四国对德政策的主要目的是在民主和平的基础上重建德国；这特别表现在波茨坦会议决定建立若干以国务部门为首的德国行政部门上。
    从这里看来，战胜国在波茨坦会议上就已经承认了它们要把德国当作一个单一的经济政治整体看待，这是完全正确的；只有遵守德国在经济与政治上统一的原则，才能实现四国政府领袖在对德政策上给自己规定下的任务。这种政策必须保证肃清德国的军国主义和法西斯主义；必须保证德国和平工业、农业和整个德国国民经济的发展；必须保证德国国内与国外贸易、德国与其他国家间的经济关系的发展。这是有利于满足德国人民的需要与和平要求以及实现他们对盟国之义务的。
    上述对德政策原则的进一步发展，表现在一九四七年莫斯科的第四届四国外长会议的决定上。当时，法、英、美、苏四国外长对于有必要准备采取措施以建立临时全德政府问题曾得到结论。我强调全德政府这一点。这个结论符合波茨坦会议上所通过的德国政治统一的原则，而且是这个原则的具体的作法。
    莫斯科外长会议曾详细规定了将来德国中央政府的权力，强调这个政府“有权采取立法与行政措施，以保证必要的统一”，而且进一步指出，上面所指的是政治统一、经济统一、财政统一和法律的统一。苏、法、英、美四国代表团规定中央政府有权管辖这样一些问题：发行钞票与硬币，调配银行活动，税收，管制出口、进口及外汇，对外贸易和关税。此外，苏、美、英三国代表又规定德国中央政府还有权管辖下面这些问题：管制粮食的交纳，分配缺少的食物和原料，管制劳动条件、工资和物价以及其他一些对于全德都重要的问题。
    欧洲咨询委员会关于德国管制机构曾获协议。按照这个协议，管制一切有关整个德国的问题的最高权力，应交由德境各占领区盟军总司令联合行使，四国总司令并为使行这种权力组成一个最高管制机关，叫做管制委员会。管制委员会的任务如下：一、保证各总司令在其占领区内行动适当的配合；二、草拟全德共同的主要军事、政治、经济和其他问题的计划，并在这些问题上获得一致的决定；三、对德国中央行政机构的管制；四、经由相当的主管机构指导“大柏林”的行政。这就是问题的四个主要方面。它们使得管制委员会担负了明确的责任，由此可见，整个管制委员会机能是用来实施德国的肃清军国主义和民主化，便利把德国重建为一个单一的、民主的、爱好和平的国家。苏联政府在管制委员会活动的整个期间，曾始终不渝地为实现这些任务而奋斗。如果把按照上述任务而组织的管制委员会的活动，看作是防止德国侵略复活的危险、是德国的民主建设和满足曾受德国侵略之害的盟国的合法要求的基本条件，这是很正确的。
    苏联在德国赔偿问题上的态度，是人所周知的。
    但是，在所有这些问题上，外长会议迄今为止都未能达到一致的决定。
    美英法三国政府采取了三国决定和三国措施的道路，这和美英苏法四国以前在德国问题上所通过的决定显然是矛盾的。建立西德政府的计划，就是这种措施里面的一个，这个计划是用来确定德国的分裂、使西德与德国的其余部分相对立的。美英法本年四月在华盛顿所通过的关于合并西德联占区基本原则的决定，关于西德占领法规的决定，以及关于建立鲁尔管制局的三边协定，也都追求着同样的目的。
    早在波茨坦会议时，苏联政府就建议承认作为德国不可分割的一部分的鲁尔工业区，必须由美、英、苏、法联合管制。苏联政府那时建议为鲁尔工业区设立一定年限的专门的盟国委员会，由上述四国代表组成。苏联的这种态度是人所周知的，我不预备多说这个问题。苏联政府对于鲁尔问题曾经并将继续寄以巨大的重视。苏联政府过去和现在都认为，在军事和工业上都异常重要的鲁尔，不受以四国为基础的国际管制，这种情况是不对的。下述事实也是不对的，即德国管制委员会不能考虑和解决有关鲁尔的问题，特别是该委员会之不能管制在整个德国经济中起决定作用的煤与铁的生产和分配问题。组织由美英法苏四国（它们的代表参加咨问鲁尔之生产与产品分配问题的盟国委员会）和其他们毗邻德国、对德国问题特别利害相关的国家，即比、荷、卢、丹、波、捷六国的代表，以及德国经济机构的代表组成的国际鲁尔管制机构，会是保证对鲁尔工业地区进行适当国际管制的手段。
    苏联代表团目前不对西方国家关于西德、特别是关于鲁尔的一切措施详加论列，因为苏联政府对这些问题的态度已经充分说明且为众所周知，它认为必须重申它关于这些措施的立场，并再次宣布这些措施与欧洲人民的和平与安全的利益背道而驰。
    苏联政府过去主张现在仍然主张建立德国的经济与政治的统一。苏联政府曾努力奋斗，使管制委员会在其行动上遵循这个方向，而管制委员会是负责在占领时期执行德国最高权力，并且保证实现德国清除军国主义及使德国民主化，保证它重建成单一的爱好和平的民主国家。
    在结束我的演说时，我向外长会议提出苏联代表团的下述具体建议：
    （一）为保证德国经济与政治的统一起见：
    甲、在先前的基础上，恢复对德管制委员会的活动，作为在德国负责执行最高权力的机构。
    乙、恢复柏林各盟国联合司令部，以协调管理柏林全市范围的措施，并保证柏林全市的正常生活。
    （二）同时鉴于如果不建立单一的德国中央机构，则实行德国经济与政治的统一是不可能的，因此承认有必要：
    甲、以东、西占领区现存的经济机构为基础，建立全德国的国务会议。
    乙、恢复柏林市议会。全柏林市议会的选举日期问题，将交由柏林盟国司令部考虑。
