    I Take Over Taiyuan Yan Faction's Industry
    Northwest Steel Plant and Others Resume Production
    [Taiyuan Electricity] All light and heavy industries in Taiyuan, originally belonging to the bureaucratic capital of war criminal Yan Xishan, have been preliminarily taken over by personnel dispatched by the Taiyuan Military Control Commission. These include: 28 units under the Northwest Industrial Corporation (including the Northwest Steel Plant, Northwest Yucai Steel Machinery Plant, Northwest Cement Plant, Northwest Locomotive Plant, Northwest Woolen Mill, Taiyuan Weaving Factory, Taiyuan Textile Factory, Taiyuan Cotton Mill, Taiyuan Flour Mill, etc.), two units under the Jinxing Enterprise Co., Ltd. (Jinxing Company Manufacturing Plant, Jinxing Automobile Factory), seven units under the Jinxing Machinery Company, in addition to the three water plants under the Waterworks Bureau and 16 factories such as the "Sui Jing" Printing Factory, Jinxing Publishing House, Zhengxing Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Machinery Factory, Fuxing Machinery Factory, and Northwest Manufacturing Factory. Also taken over were 13 production and management units such as the Taiyuan Sui Jing Armory and the Sui Jing Armory Mineral Survey Bureau. A total of 53 factories and 17 management enterprises. Employees of various factories have returned to work one after another, reaching more than 20,000 people by April 30. Currently, materials are being inventoried, accounts are being checked, and resumption of work is being actively prepared. Because the Yan Xishan bandit gang stubbornly opposed the people until death, Taiyuan's industry suffered heavy damage. The sulfuric acid manufacturing equipment of the Northwest Chemical Plant in Beiguan was destroyed by Yan bandits' artillery fire. In the Northwest Repair Factory alone, more than 40 employees were killed or injured by bandit troops' artillery fire. However, the workers in Taiyuan guarded the factories under tense war conditions, so that most of the assets, accounts, and files could be preserved. Workers Zhao Falong and Li Zhen of the Northwest Chemical Plant protected the factory and assisted the People's Liberation Army in combat under artillery fire, and were commended and rewarded by the Military Control Commission. After our takeover personnel entered the city, they distributed more than 60,000 jin of grain they brought with them to the factories as living expenses for the workers. With the active actions of the workers, the circuit from the city's power plant to the Northwest Steel Plant was repaired on the second day after the end of the battle, allowing the steel furnace to survive a serious danger. On the morning of the 26th, the Water Company began to supply water to the urban area. The Northwest Steel Plant, Northwest Electrochemical Plant, and Taiyuan Oxygen Plant have all resumed work. The Northwest Locomotive Plant, Northwest Repair Plant, Northwest Paper Mill, Taiyuan Flour Mill, and the six factories under the Jinxing Machinery Company have all partially resumed work.

    我接管太原阎匪工业
    西北炼钢厂等已复工生产
    【太原电】原属战犯阎锡山官僚资本的太原全部轻重工业，已由太原军管会派员初步接管。计有：西北实业公司所辖二十八个单位（包括西北炼钢厂、西北育才炼钢机器厂、西北洋灰厂、西北机车厂、西北毛织厂、太原织造厂、太原纺织厂、太原棉织厂、太原面粉厂等），晋兴企业股份有限公司所辖两个单位（晋兴公司制造厂、晋兴汽车厂），晋兴机械公司所辖七个单位，此外，还有自来水管理局下辖的三个自来水厂及“绥署”印刷厂、晋兴出版社、正兴机器厂、太原机器厂、复兴机器厂、西北制造厂等十六个工厂。同时被接管的有太原绥署兵工室、绥署兵工矿产测量局等十三个经营管理生产的单位。总共五十三个工厂，及十七个经营管理的企业机构。各厂职工已陆续回厂报到，截至四月三十日止已达两万余人。现正清点物资，清查帐目，积极筹备复工。由于阎锡山匪帮至死与人民为敌，致太原工业遭到惨重的破坏，北关西北化学厂的制造硫酸设备，被阎匪炮火轰毁，仅西北修造厂一处，即有四十余名职工惨遭匪军炮火杀伤。但太原的职工在紧张的战争情况下看守工厂，使资财、帐簿、档案等，大部得以保存。西北化学厂工人赵发龙，李珍，在炮火中保护工厂协助解放军作战，受到军管会的表扬和奖励。当我接管人员入城后，即将随带来的六万余斤粮食分发到各厂，作为工人生活维持费用。在工人积极行动下，战斗结束第二天，城内发电厂到西北炼钢厂的电路，即告修复，使炼钢炉渡过了严重的危险。二十六日早晨，自来水公司，开始向市区送水。西北炼钢厂、西北电化厂、太原氧气厂三工厂已全部复工。西北机车厂、西北修造厂、西北制纸厂、太原面粉厂及晋兴机械公司所辖之六个厂，均已部分复工。
