Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 6th. The Third Session of the Second United Nations General Assembly, which has been meeting for a month, is continuing in an unsatisfactory manner due to the manipulation and control of the United States. Soviet representative Malik has suggested that the General Assembly should close on May 16.

The Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly is operating under abnormal conditions. The committee has met for more than 20 days without any progress. The first item on the agenda—the issue of Italian colonies—has not yet been fully discussed. Soviet representative Malik pointed out at a meeting of the committee that the delay in the above discussion is due to the fact that some countries do not want to resolve the issue of Italian colonies at present, and these countries also hope to remove the discussion of many issues from the agenda of the General Assembly, such as the Indonesian issue and the issue related to Franco's Spain.

The plenary sessions of the General Assembly and the meetings of the various committees are proceeding in an overlapping manner. TASS pointed out: One of the characteristics of the plenary session is the discussion of internal affairs issues unrelated to the United Nations, which makes it impossible to discuss important topics. The Anglo-American protest against the suppression of foreign spies in Hungary and Bulgaria is one example.

Another characteristic of the General Assembly is that the British and American representatives continue their activities of bypassing the Security Council and violating the UN Charter to resolve important international issues. The General Assembly has already adopted three recommendations of the so-called "Standing Committee" (also known as the Small General Assembly) submitted by the Special Political Committee. The first recommendation stipulates that, after slight modifications, the so-called general regulations formulated by the former League of Nations on September 26, 1928, should be restored. It is well known that this regulation established a method for resolving disputes between countries on the basis of arbitration, which was beneficial to the United Kingdom and France, which ruled the League of Nations at that time. The second recommendation, based on the "experience of the League of Nations," stipulates the appointment of so-called "mediators" to bypass the Security Council, and authorizes these "mediators" to "mediate" various disputes. The third recommendation stipulates the establishment of an "investigators and mediators" agency, which has important powers in the system of peaceful settlement of disputes.

The General Assembly also passed a resolution to establish a fourteen-nation special committee to study the issue of establishing a UN guard force. The Soviet representative pointed out that the above resolution clearly violates the UN Charter, which stipulates that the power to establish armed forces belongs only to the Security Council. The representatives of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries voted against the aforementioned two proposals during the vote.

### 美帝违反联合国宪章  操纵把持联大会议  苏联代表建议闭幕

    美帝违反联合国宪章
    操纵把持联大会议
    苏联代表建议闭幕
    【新华社北平六日电】集会已达一月的第三届第二次联合国大会，由于美国的操纵和把持，正在不能令人满意地继续举行。苏联代表马立克已建议大会应于五月十六日闭幕。
    大会政治安全委员会在不正常的情况下进行活动。该委员会开会二十余日，毫无进展。第一项议题——意大利殖民地问题，至今仍未完成讨论。苏联代表马立克在该委员会的会议上指出，上述讨论的拖延，是由于某些国家不希望在目前解决意大利殖民地问题，这些国家并希望从大会议程中取消许多问题的讨论，诸如印尼问题及有关佛朗哥西班牙的问题。
    全体大会与各委员会的会议交错地进行着。塔斯社指出：全体大会的特点之一，是讨论一些与联合国无关的内政问题，从而使重要议题无法讨论。美英对匈保镇压外国间谍所提的抗议即其一例。
    大会的另一特点，是美英代表继续其绕过安理会、违犯联合国宪章以解决重要的国际问题的活动。大会已经通过特别政治委员会提交的所谓“驻会委员会”（又称小型大会）的三个建议。第一个建议规定，在稍加修改之后，恢复前国联在一九二八年九月二十六日制订的所谓一般法规，尽人皆知，这个法规确立了在仲裁基础上解决各国间纠纷的办法，而这个办法对于当时统治国联的英法两国是有利的。第二个建议参酌“国联的经验”，为了绕过安理会，规定任命所谓“调解人”，并授权这些“调解人”居间“调解”各种纠纷。第三个建议规定设立“调查人和调解人”机构，上述机构在和平解决纠纷的制度中拥有重要职权。
    大会又通过成立十四国特别委员会以研究建立联合国警卫队问题的决议。苏联代表指出：上述决议明显地违背联合国宪章，宪章规定建立武装部队之权力仅属于安理会。在前述两案进行表决时，苏联及新民主国家的代表俱投反对票。
