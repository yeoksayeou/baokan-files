　　Lax Systems Waste Raw Materials
  　Xinhua Paper Mill Needs Urgent Rectification
    [Our Newspaper] The publicly-owned Xinhua Paper Mill in Changzhi City, Taihang, has serious problems such as lax systems, relaxed discipline, waste of raw materials, and increased costs. The factory stipulates systems, but everyone does not seriously implement them. When the factory went on vacation this year, it was decided to start the vacation on December 28th and return to work on January 7th, but workers were not all back until January 20th. The storage section stipulates a system of exchanging old items for new ones when receiving salaries, but often people receive new items without handing in the old ones. Another problem is the slack discipline and unclear rewards and punishments. Last year, during the factory's production increase campaign, workers in the papermaking department saved coal, and Guo Budong, a worker in the washing material department, saved burlap bags, but neither received the rewards they deserved, and the workers became lax. Once, a beating material worker fell asleep while working, and the material trough overflowed without anyone taking care of it, resulting in a lot of material being washed away, but no criticism or punishment was given. The material steamed by the material section generally takes nine to ten hours for an electric mill to process, but once, because the technical instructor did not personally inspect and supervise, the material was steamed too hard and took sixteen hours, wasting a lot of electricity. The storage section placed raw materials in the open air and did not take care to preserve them, resulting in a lot of loss from rain and wind. Due to the above reasons, the papermaking cost of the factory has greatly increased. For example, in February of this year, paper bought from merchants on the market cost 40,000 yuan, but the factory's cost was more than 40,000 yuan. The main reason for the above problems is that the factory's leading cadres lack a serious and responsible attitude in adhering to systems, enforcing discipline, and improving management. At the same time, the municipal party committee and the trade union's leadership of the factory is not specific. The factory has recently made some improvements, such as clearing raw materials and stipulating systems. However, this reporter believes that there has not been a fundamental change in leadership thinking, so as to change leadership methods and formulate scientific systems, so that the factory's face can be renewed.

　　制度松懈浪费原料
  　新华纸厂急须整顿
    【本报讯】太行长治市公营新华造纸厂，存在着制度松懈、纪律废弛、浪费原料以至提高成本等严重问题。工厂规定下制度，大家都不认真执行。该厂今年放年假时，决定十二月二十八日放假，一月七日上工，但一月二十日工人还没有上齐。保管股规定领薪交旧制度，往往领了新的不交旧的。另外是纪律废弛赏罚不明。去年该厂开展增产运动中，造纸部工人节省煤炭，洗料工人郭不动节省麻袋都没有得到应有的奖励，工人就松劲。有一次打料工人在工作时睡着觉，料糟满了也没人管，结果把料冲出好多，也不加批评处罚。该厂材料股蒸出的料，一般用电碾一次费九个到十个钟头，可是有一次因为技术指导员没有亲自检查督促，把料蒸硬了，就用了十六个钟头，浪费了很多电力。保管股把原料放在露天里，不认真保存，雨打风吹脱损很多。由于以上原因遂使该厂造纸成本大为提高。如今年二月份市场上经过商人买来的纸才四万元，该厂造成本四万元以上。产生以上问题的原因，主要由于该厂领导干部缺乏用认真负责的态度去坚持制度、严肃纪律、改善管理。同时市委和职工会对该厂的领导也不具体，该厂最近一个时期已经有了若干改进，象清理原料、规定制度等。但记者认为还没有根本从领导思想上扭转过来，从而改变领导方法，订出科学制度，使工厂面貌为之一新。（荣安）
