Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th. According to reports: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, at the invitation of U.S. President Truman, has decided to visit Washington this summer via Japan. An Indian defense mission requesting U.S. military aid has recently arrived in the U.S. Meanwhile, expansionist elements such as Republican Senator Hoffer of Minnesota are launching a movement to "make India America's best ally in Asia." Hoffer openly said on the 27th: "India is an opportunity the United States has obtained in Asia." He said that the situation in China (referring to the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule) is irreversible, "but the United States must have a foothold on the Asian continent." Hoffer indicated that the United States will still support Japanese militarist forces but felt that "the American people are not yet psychologically comfortable with Japan." Therefore, he believes that implementing expansion into Asian countries through India "is better than through any other country." Hoffer emphasized India's geographical importance in the Middle East and Far East and coveted India's rich natural resources. He said: "We cannot just stay on the edge of Asia; we must go to the Asian continent." He also specifically mentioned that the economies of Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia need the United States to "develop" them. Hoffer made no secret of the U.S. intention to use India as a strategic base for attacking the Soviet Union, saying that "India's border is located in the underbelly of the Soviet Union."

    美帝扩张主义分子赫夫莱的无耻叫嚣
    公开表示以印为侵苏基地
    【新华社北平卅日电】据息：印度总理尼赫鲁已应美总统杜鲁门之邀，决定于今夏经日本往访华盛顿。请求美国军事援助的印度国防使团，则已于最近抵美。同时，明尼苏达州共和党参议员赫夫莱等扩张主义分子，正发动一个“使印度成为美国在亚洲最好友邦”的运动。赫夫莱二十七日公开说：“印度乃是美国在亚洲所获得的一个机会。”他说，中国的局势（按指国民党反动统治的崩溃）已无可挽回，“但美国必须在亚洲大陆上有其驻脚点”。赫夫莱表示美国仍将扶植日本军国主义势力，但又感到“美国人民对日心理还不太愉快”。因此认为通过印度来对亚洲各国实行扩张，“比通过任何其他国家都要好”。赫夫莱强调印度在中东及远东的地理上的重要性，并唾涎印度自然资源的丰富。他说：“我们不能仅仅在亚洲的边缘上，我们必须到亚洲大陆上去”。他又具体提到朝鲜、台湾、澳大利亚、新西兰及印尼等地的经济，也需要美国前去“开发”。赫夫莱毫不掩饰美国图以印度作为进攻苏联的战略基地，说什么“印度的边境处在苏联的腹部”。
