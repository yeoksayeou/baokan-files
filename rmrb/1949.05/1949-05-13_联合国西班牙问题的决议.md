    UN Resolution on the Spanish Question
    --Since Franco, the head of the Spanish fascist organization "Falange," seized power with brutal force and conspiracy in 1936, Spain has become a hell on earth. During World War II, Franco served as a pawn of the Axis powers and sent the Blue Division to participate in Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union. However, after the collapse of Hitler's and Mussolini's aggressive forces, Franco was not duly punished under the "protection" of American and British imperialism. In April 1946, Poland first proposed to the United Nations Security Council a motion for all UN members to sever diplomatic relations with Spain. At that time, the Soviet Union, France, and other UN members adopted a positive attitude of approval, while only American and British imperialism expressed hesitation. In December 1946, under the high pressure of world democratic forces, American and British imperialism had to change their attitude and express their support. At that time, the United Nations "Political and Security Committee" passed a resolution – calling on the Spanish people to overthrow Franco's fascist government, prohibiting Spain from participating in the United Nations, and recalling ambassadors from various countries stationed in Spain. After this resolution was established, due to the American imperialist conspiracy to undermine it, they continued to engage in trade and other relations with Franco. When the UN General Assembly "Political and Security Committee" discussed the Spanish issue again in November 1947, due to the efforts and urging of democratic countries, the Political Committee decided to reiterate the previous year's resolution on Spain.

    联合国西班牙问题的决议
    ——一九三六年西班牙法西斯组织“长枪会”头子佛朗哥用武力残暴阴谋夺取政权以后，西班牙就成为人间地狱。第二次世界大战中佛朗哥曾充当轴心国的走狗，派遣蓝色师团参加了希特勒的侵苏战争。但在希特勒和墨索里尼侵略势力垮台以后，佛朗哥却在美英帝国主义的“保护”下未受到应得惩处。一九四六年四月，波兰首先在联合国安全理事会提出所有联合国会员与西班牙绝交的议案，当时苏、法及其他联合国会员都采取了积极赞同的态度，只有美英帝国主义表示犹豫不决。一九四六年十二月，美英帝国主义在世界民主力量的高压下不得不改变态度，表示赞成。当时，联合国“政治安全委员会”曾通过了决议——唤起西班牙人民推翻佛朗哥的法西斯政府，不准西班牙参加联合国并召回各国驻西使节。这个决议成立后，因为美帝国主义阴谋破坏，仍不断与佛朗哥发生贸易等关系。一九四七年十一月联大“政治安全委员会”再次讨论西班牙问题时，由于民主国家努力敦促，政委会又决定了重申上年对西班牙的决议。
