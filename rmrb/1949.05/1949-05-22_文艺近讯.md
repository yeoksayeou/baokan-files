　　I. The new work "New Children's Heroes" by Kong Jue and Yuan Jing is a story written in popular form about the struggle of farmers in central Hebei against the enemy. It is divided into twenty chapters, with a length of 160,000 to 170,000 words, starting from the July 7th Incident and ending with the Japanese surrender.
