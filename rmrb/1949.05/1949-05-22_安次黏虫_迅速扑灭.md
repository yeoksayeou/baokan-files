　　Anci County Cutworm
    Quickly Eliminate
    [Jizhong News] Nearly a hundred mu of wheat fields near Caiying Village, First District, Anci County, have been affected by insect pests. Twenty mu are more severely affected. The insects are yellowish-brown, about half an inch long, and are commonly called cutworms. Every morning and evening, they climb onto the leaves to eat, damaging the wheat leaves. After the county discovered this, it immediately sent people to cooperate with district cadres to mobilize 46 villagers to go to the fields to catch and kill the insects. Each person took a small stick to hit the insects off the plants into a dustpan held below. In less than two hours, eight and a half jin of insects were collected. In order to thoroughly eliminate the pests and protect the wheat harvest, the next morning, 110 county officials were mobilized, along with more than 100 villagers, to catch and kill the insects. The pests were basically eliminated in one morning. Now, the county party committee has instructed all districts to strictly inspect wheat fields. Once pests are discovered, they must be quickly caught and eliminated. (Junjie, Xingye, Huiwen)

　　安次黏虫
    迅速扑灭
    【冀中讯】安次县一区蔡营村南附近麦田，近百亩发生虫灾，其中二十亩较为严重，虫子是黄褐色长约半寸，俗名叫黏虫，每天早晨和傍晚即爬到叶子上去吃，把麦叶都咬坏了。县发觉后立即派人协同区干部，发动了该村群众四十六人，下地捕打，每人拿一小棍在上面打，一个簸箕在下面接，这样没有两个钟头就打了八斤半。为了彻底扑灭害虫保护麦收，第二天清早又动员了县机关人员一百一十名，协同群众一百多人，扑打一早晨，害虫基本扑灭。现在县委已指示各区，要严格检查麦田，一旦发现害虫要迅速予以捕灭。　　（俊杰、兴业、惠文）
