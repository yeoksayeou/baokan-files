This year's commemoration of the "May Fourth" Movement is characterized by the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, the liberation of Nanjing, the declaration of the demise of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, and the imminent nationwide victory of the revolution.

What is the victory of this revolution?

I believe it is the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

Why do I say this? Because if we look at the past thirty years with a calm mind and a long-term vision, we can see that the development of the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement involved two different lines developing and struggling. Now, one has succeeded, and the other has failed. This is in line with the laws of historical development. These two lines each have their own ideologies, theories, political views, and political systems. Because at the time, they were both products of the new era and the emerging Chinese classes, and on the surface, they were both anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, making it difficult for people to distinguish right from wrong and recognize their merits. In fact, these two lines are one revolutionary and the other reformist; one represents the proletariat, and the other represents the bourgeoisie; one is Marxist-Leninist, and the other is pragmatist. The earliest and most forceful advocate of Marxism-Leninism was Comrade Li Dazhao; the earliest and most forceful advocate of Dewey's pragmatism was Hu Shi. Because at that time, the United States took advantage of the exhaustion of both sides of the imperialist powers during World War I, joined the Entente powers of Britain and France, and thus Britain, France, and the United States were fortunate to win. As a result, slogans like "Justice triumphs over might!" and "Democracy triumphs over militarism!" and "Wilson's Fourteen Points are the guarantee of world peace!" were particularly loud. At this time, the United States became the first powerful country in the world, and the pragmatism that Hu Shi brought back from the United States was particularly welcomed and became the most fashionable thing. Hu Shi was very much in the limelight. Therefore, people generally believed that the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement was led by Hu Shi and others. In fact, Hu Shi and others were not only not the leaders of the new culture, but also not the leaders of the "May Fourth" Movement. On the contrary, they were opponents. The true leader and organizer was Comrade Li Dazhao. Moreover, he waged an irreconcilable struggle with Hu Shi. Please look at the following facts:

Less than a year after the victory of the Russian proletariat's October Revolution in 1917, the German and Austrian proletariat rose up to overthrow their reactionary governments. Britain, France, and the United States were thus victorious. China also nominally participated in the war, joining the Entente powers of Britain, France, and the United States. Without sending a single soldier, it borrowed a lot of war debts to arm the anti-people and counter-revolutionary warlords. But because the Entente powers were victorious, China was incidentally a "victorious country." In October 1918, Comrade Li Dazhao published "The Victory of the Common People" and "The Victory of Bolshevism" in the New Youth, Volume 5, Number 5. While the general public was clamoring to "celebrate victory," Comrade Dazhao ridiculed their ignorance and blind celebration, clearly pointing out that the new world must be the victory "of the common people," the victory of the proletariat. In May 1919, Comrade Dazhao published "My View of Marxism." Hu Shi rose up to oppose it. In July, he wrote "Study More Problems, Talk Less About Isms" in the "Weekly Review" to oppose the spread of Marxism in China. Comrade Dazhao published "Another Discussion on Problems and Isms" to refute him, pointing out that the prevalence of Marxism "is indeed a major change in world culture," and that the study of problems cannot be separated from method and must have an "-ism." In December, Hu Shi published "The Significance of New Thought," opposing Marxism, advocating "gradual reform," and "solving this and that problem," opposing fundamental social transformation and opposing revolution. Hu Shi also had articles opposing the "May Fourth" Movement. These are all facts.

During the "May Fourth" era, due to the strength of the United States, Hu Shi and others invited Dewey to China to promote pragmatism, and their arrogance was unparalleled. At that time, the emerging Chinese bourgeoisie was also thriving. As for the Chinese proletariat, although it also developed greatly at the same time, it was still very young and had not yet been organized. In terms of population proportion, it was still pitifully small. Moreover, Soviet Russia was hated by the governments of all countries in the world (including the Chinese government), and the propaganda and development of Marxism-Leninism were not allowed. However, the Chinese Marxists at that time recognized the following truth in Marx's dialectical materialism:

"In dialectics, the most important thing is not what seems solid at the moment but has already begun to decline, but what is being produced and developing, even if it does not seem solid at the moment, because in dialectics, only what is being produced and developing is invincible." (History of the CPSU(B), Chapter Four, Section 2)

That is to say:

"Do not rely on the classes in society that are no longer developing, even if these classes are still dominant forces at the moment, but rely on the classes in society that are developing and have broad prospects, even if these classes are not dominant forces at the moment." (Ibid.)

Therefore, the Chinese Marxists relied on the proletariat, and the direction of China's new cultural development should not be representative of the bourgeoisie, but representative of the proletariat. In 1921, the vanguard of the proletariat – the Communist Party of China – was born. It used the theory of the proletariat and Marxism-Leninism to guide the Chinese revolution. Since then, the Communist Party of China has led the first great revolution of 1925-27 – the Northern Expedition, led the second great revolution of 1927-37 – the Land Revolution, led the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and National Revolution of 1937-45, and the current third great revolution – the People's Liberation War. The Chinese Marxists were not mistaken. Today, facts prove that the Chinese proletariat and its vanguard – the Communist Party – have developed from a small force to a first-class historical and political force.

Therefore, we should say that the victory of the Chinese revolution today is the victory of the revolutionary line and the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

As for the reformist line, it initially represented the emerging national bourgeoisie of China, so it was also anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. But: on the one hand, pragmatism is a theory brought from the United States, worshiping the United States, and changing with the changes in the United States. The United States had a period of prosperity after the war, and thus there were various anti-Marxist "theories" such as "the American economy is a new type of capitalism, which is eternally healthy and can peacefully transition to socialism without revolution." American monopoly capitalist gradually developed into the most reactionary fortress of world imperialism, and the Chinese reformists also followed the trend of American imperialism and became reactionary; on the other hand, because of the weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, the vassals cultivated by the United States – the feudal compradors – took advantage of the situation and became the monopoly capitalists of China. The reformists who initially represented the bourgeoisie, because of their pro-Americanism and their own corruption, no longer represented the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal Chinese national bourgeoisie, but represented the American running dogs, the Chinese feudal comprador big bourgeoisie. Today, it is not surprising that Hu Shi has become an accomplice of the national traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

Reformists often flaunt themselves as liberals and take a middle-of-the-road approach, believing that they are super-class and stand outside of class struggle, between revolution and counter-revolution. In fact, in class society, there is no classless middle ground. The so-called "middle ground" will inevitably fall into the counter-revolutionary position when class struggle is sharp. This is something that people with such thoughts should be deeply vigilant about.

    纪念“五四”三十周年应有的认识
    吴玉章
    今年纪念“五四”的特点，是人民解放军获得伟大胜利，南京已经解放，南京国民党反动政府已宣告灭亡，革命很快就要得到全国范围的胜利。
    这一革命的胜利是什么东西的胜利呢？
    我认为是马列主义的胜利。
    为什么这样讲呢？因为：我们如果以冷静的头脑、远大的眼光来透视这三十年事变的经过，就可以看出“五四”新文化运动的发展，有两条不同的路线在发展着、斗争着。到现在：一个是成功了；一个是失败了。这是合于历史发展的规律的。这两条路线各有它的思想、理论、政治观点、政治制度。因为在当时它们都是新时代和中国新兴阶级的产物，表面上都是反帝反封建的，因而使人难于辨别是非、认识它们的好坏。其实这两条路线，一个是革命的，一个是改良主义的；一个是代表无产阶级的，一个是代表资产阶级的；一个马列主义的，一个是实验主义的。宣传马列主义最早最有力的人是李大钊同志；宣传杜威实验主义最早最有力的人是胡适。因为当时美国乘第一次世界大战帝国主义双方都精疲力竭的时候，加入英法协约国方面，因而英法美就侥幸得到了胜利，于是什么公理战胜强权啦！民主主义战胜军国主义啦！威尔逊的十四条是世界和平的保障啦！叫得特别响。这时美国成了世界第一个强盛的国家，胡适从美国带回的实验主义就特别受到欢迎，成了最时髦的东西，胡适的风头出得很足。因此，一般人都以为“五四”新文化运动是胡适等领导的，其实胡适等不仅不是新文化的领导者，也不是“五四”运动的领导者，恰恰相反，他们是反对者。真正的领导者和组织者是李大钊同志。而且他和胡适作了不调和的斗争。请看下面的事实吧：
    当一九一七年俄国无产阶级十月革命胜利后不到一年，德奥无产阶级起来推翻他们的反动政府，英法美得因此获得胜利，中国也在名义上参战，参加了英法美等协约国，没有出过一个兵，却借了许多参战外债来武装了反人民反革命的军阀，但因为协约国胜利了，中国也附带成了“胜利国”。一九一八年十月李大钊同志在新青年五卷五号上发表“庶民的胜利”“布尔塞维克的胜利”二文，在一般人喧言“庆祝胜利”的时候，大钊同志嘲笑他们的无知和盲目的庆祝，明白指出新世须必是“庶民的”胜利、无产阶级的胜利。一九一九年五月大钊同志又发表“我之马克思主义观”。胡适起来反对，七月他在“每周评论”上作了“多研究问题少谈些主义”一文来反对马克思主义在中国传播。大钊同志发表“再论问题与主义”来驳斥他，指出马克思主义“的流行，实在是世界文化上一大变动”，研究问题不能离开方法，缺了主义。十二月胡适又发表“新思潮的意义”，反对马克思主义，主张“一点一滴的改造”，“这个那个问题的解决”，反对社会的根本改造，反对革命。关于“五四”运动胡适也曾有过反对的文章，这都是事实。
    “五四”时代，由于美国的强盛，胡适等请杜威到中国作实验主义的宣传，其气焰不可一世。当时新兴的中国资产阶级也正是欣欣向荣的时候。至于中国的无产阶级虽同时有很大的发展，但还很幼稚，还没有组织起来。以人口比例来说还少得可怜。而当时的苏维埃俄罗斯，又为世界各国政府（中国政府也在内）认痛恨，更不许马列主义的宣传发展，然而当时中国的马克思主义者认识了马克思的辩证唯物主义的下面一个真理，就是：
    “在辩证法看来，最重要的不是现时似乎坚固，但已经开始衰亡的东西，前是正在产生，正在发展的东西，那怕它现时似乎还不坚固，因为在辩证法看来，只有正在产生，正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。”（联共党史四章二节）
    这就是说：
    “不要指靠社会里已经不再发展的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还是占优势的力量，而是要指靠社会里正在发展、具有远大前途的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还不是占优势的力量。”（同上）
    因此，中国的马克思主义者就指靠于无产阶级，而中国新文化发展的方向，不应是代表资产阶级的，而应是代表无产阶级的。到一九二一年，无产阶级的先锋队——中国共产党产生了。它是以无产阶级的、马列主义的理论来指导中国革命的。从此以后，中国共产党领导了一九二五——二七的第一次大革命一一北伐战争，领导了一九二七——三七的第二次大革命——土地革命，领导了一九三七——四五的抗日民族革命战争和现在的第三次大革命——人民解放战争。中国的马克思主义者并没有弄错。到了今天，事实证明，中国无产阶级及其先锋队——共产党，已由一个不大的力量发展成为头等历史的和政治的力量。
    因此，我们应该说，中国革命今天的胜利是革命路线的胜利，是马列主义的胜利。
    至于改良主义的路线，最初它是代表中国新兴的民族资产阶级，因此它也反帝反封建。但是它：一方面实验主义是从美国带来的理论，崇拜美国，也因美国的变化而变化。美国在大战后有一个时期的繁荣，因而有“美国的经济是新式的资本主义，是永远健康的，不必革命就可以和平转入社会主义的”，各种各样反马克思主义的“理论”。美国的垄断资本家主义逐渐发展成了世界帝国主义最反动的堡垒，中国的改良主义者也随美帝国主义而趋于反动；一方面，因为中国民族资产阶级的软弱，美国培植的附庸——封建买办阶级，因利乘便，成了中国的垄断的大资产阶级。最初代表资产阶级的改良主义者，因为亲美的关系，本身的腐化，已经不是代表反帝反封建的中国民族资产阶级，而是代表美国的走狗中国封建买办大资产阶级。今天的胡适成了系国贼蒋介石的帮凶是不足怪的。
    改良主义者常常是以自由主义、中间路线相标榜，自以为他们是超阶级的，站在阶级斗争之外、站在革命与反革命之间，其实在阶级社会里，没有无阶级的中间立场，所谓“中间立场”，在阶级斗争尖锐时，一定会落到反革命的立场，这是有这样思想的人应当深深警惕的。
