    Celebrating the Liberation of Nanjing
    Tangshan Workers Work Overtime and Donate Money
    [Tangshan Telegraph] To celebrate the liberation of Nanjing, workers at the Tangshan Steel Plant voluntarily worked overtime and decided to use their spare time to build a Nanjing Liberation Memorial Tower. On April 25th, workers in the steel workshop voluntarily worked overtime for two hours, and workers in the furnace repair and scrap steel sorting groups worked overtime for two consecutive days, April 25th and 27th. They all refused overtime pay. The construction of the Nanjing Liberation Memorial Tower will begin shortly in the workers' spare time in various departments. Female workers at the Huaxin Yarn Factory have turned the slogan "Liberate Nanjing" into their greeting when they meet on and off work. When workers in various departments stopped to eat, they spontaneously initiated donations to慰劳 (comfort) the southward People's Liberation Army, with 534 people donating 18.34 million Changcheng coupons. Workers at the Qixin Porcelain Factory also donated more than 110,000 yuan in People's Currency and sent a telegram to the People's Liberation Army saying: "Our entire staff is willing to do everything possible to take responsibility for strengthening production in the rear and supporting the War of Liberation." Workers at Kailuan East Third Mine and the Tangshan Locomotive Repair Factory are also donating money and writing letters of慰问 (condolences/regards).

    庆祝南京解放
    唐山职工加班献金
    【唐山电】唐山制钢厂职工庆祝南京解放，自动加班，并决定利用工作空隙建立南京解放纪念塔。钢工场工友四月二十五日自动加班两小时，修炉组和整理废钢组的工友在二十五、二十七两天连续加班两小时。他们都不要加班工资。庆祝南京解放纪念塔，各部门不日即将在工余动工。华新纱厂的女工们则把“解放南京”的口号变成了她们上下班的见面礼。各部工友在停车吃饭时，自动发起捐款慰劳南下大军，五百三十四元人捐了一千八百三十四万元长城券。启新磁厂职工也捐了人民券十一万余元，并致电人民解放军说：“我们全体职工愿尽一切力量，负起在后方努力加强生产支持解放战争的责任。”开滦东三矿和唐山机车修理厂职工也都在捐款、写慰问信。
