Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 17th: Since the liberation of Northern Jiangsu, large-scale water conservancy and embankment repair projects, affecting the lives and property of nearly 20 million people in Northern Jiangsu, are being intensified in various locations. In late April, the spring repair of the Grand Canal Embankment, which is closely related to the people of Northern Jiangsu, has begun. The project is over 700 li long, requiring 400,000 cubic meters of earth. It is the responsibility of eight counties: Subei (newly established county, northern Suqian), Suqian, Sishu (newly established county, parts of Siyang and Shuyang), Huaiyin, Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, and Yangzhou. Nearly 20,000 workers are participating, and the People's Government has allocated 8 million catties of grain to assist.

Around April 15th, more than 23,000 people in Ruguo (newly established county, eastern Rufou) along the coast began to repair the southern section of the Fan Gong Dike, widening the dike surface by seven feet and filling the dike waist with grass bags to resist the sea tide. This project has now been fully completed. In Binhai County (newly established county, northern Funing), 12,000 workers began to excavate the 32-li-long South Tide River in mid-April. The government specially allocated 3 million catties of grain as work relief. This project is expected to be completed in about 35 days. By then, more than 200,000 hectares of farmland in Binhai, Liandong (newly established county, east of Lianshui) and other counties will be spared from the disaster of sea tides, and grain production can be increased by 13 million catties per year. Farmers in Guanyun County also completed the first phase of the ditch and river excavation plan half a month before the spring plowing. According to incomplete statistics, more than 130 large and small rivers and ditches have been repaired. After spring plowing, construction will continue. After the completion of the entire project, 430,000 mu of farmland will be free from flooding.

    【新华社淮阴十七日电】苏北全境解放后，约近千里的大规模治水修堤工程，正在各地加紧进行中。四月下旬，与苏北两千万人民生命财产有密切关系的运河长堤已开始春修。该工程长七百余里，需土四十万公方，由宿北（新设县、宿迁北部）、宿迁、泗沭（新设县，泗阳、沭阳各一部）、淮阴、淮安、宝应、高邮、扬州等八县负责，参加民工近二万人。人民政府拨粮八百万斤予以帮助。如果（新设县、如阜东部）沿海两万三千余人民，于四月中旬开始整修范公堤南段，在堤面加宽七尺，堤腰加塞草包，以抵御海潮泛滥，该工程已经全部完成。滨海县（新设县，阜宁北部）一万二千民工于四月中旬开始修凿长三十二里的南潮河，政府特拨粮三百万斤以工代赈。此项工程约计三十五天即可完成。届时滨海、涟东（新设县，涟水以东）等县二十多万顷田地将免受海潮之灾，每年可增产粮食一千三百万斤。灌云县农民亦于春耕前半月完成了挖沟挖河的第一阶段计划。据不完全统计，已修好大小河道沟渠一百三十余道，春耕后再继续兴修，全部工程完成以后，将有四十三万亩田免遭水灾。
