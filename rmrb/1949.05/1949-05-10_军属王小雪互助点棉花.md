[Hebei Central News] Wang Xiaoxue, an army dependent from the Sixth Street of Xinji City (also the vice director of the street's women's association), understood the benefits of planting various cotton and peanut varieties. She found the Xiao Wanzi sisters-in-law, forming a cotton planting mutual aid group. Initially, her mother-in-law was reluctant, saying, "It's so dry, and you don't know how to plant. Let's wait until it rains!" Others said, "It would take ten days to plant one mu of cotton." Wang Xiaoxue said, "It doesn't matter. The three of us will work together to plant. We'll plant one family's land, then another, and let them see if we can do it. It's often said that it's easy to buy seeds but hard to buy seedlings!" On March 27th (lunar calendar), the wind was howling when they began planting. Some carried buckets, some held dippers, and some carried hoes, laughing and talking as they went to the fields. First, they set up a door panel at the wellhead and began digging pits and carrying water. In one morning, they dug 2,499 pits and carried 124 loads of water (each load not full). Before half a day of watering, Xiaoxue and Xiao Wanzi's hands were red and about to break from the rope, but they persisted in watering. In the afternoon, they carried the seeds to plant at the designated spots. The entire day was spent planting less than one mu of land. Xiao Wanzi happily said, "We thought it would take several days to plant one mu, but this way is so fast! If it doesn't rain, we'll plant corn too. When we organize, we can overcome difficulties." Now they have finished planting one family's land and are continuing with Xiao Wanzi's family. They have high confidence in planting. (Song Chunxiao, Lei Guichen)

    军属王小雪互助点棉花
    【冀中讯】辛集市第六街军属王小雪（街妇女副主任）了解多种棉花、花生的好处，就找到小完子妯娌两，结合成点种棉花小组。最初她婆婆不愿意说：“这么旱你们又不会种，等下雨后再说吧！”又有人说：“要点一亩棉花得点十天。”王小雪说：“不要紧，俺三个人插伙种，种完一家再种一家，让他们看看咱们行不行，常说有钱买种，无钱买苗呀！”三月二十七日（旧历），风刮的呼呼响，他们便开始点种了。有的担着桶，有的拿着瓢，有的扛着镐，一路说笑到了地里。首先在井口上搭上了一个门扇，开始挖坑提水一上午挖了二四九九个坑，用水一二四挑（每担都不满）。在没有浇到半天时，小雪、小完子的手都被绳勒红快破了，但她们还是坚持的浇着。下午抬着种籽去按点，整一天功夫不足一亩地点种完了。小完子欢喜的说：“我们算着，点种一亩得好几天，这么着搞真快，天不下雨，咱们还要点玉蜀黍哩。组织起来就能克服困难”，现在他们已种完一家的了，接着种小完子家的，点种信心很高。（宋春宵，雷贵臣）
