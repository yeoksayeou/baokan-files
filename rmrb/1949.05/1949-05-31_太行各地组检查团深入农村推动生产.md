　　[Our Dispatch] The Taihang District Party Committee Office has compiled reports from various locations: In order to promote the production movement in a timely and effective manner, the Taihang Administrative Office has organized three inspection teams, led by the heads of various departments of the Administrative Office, to go to the first, third, and fifth districts for inspection. Around April 20th, the local party committees and county committees organized inspection teams and went to various locations to conduct in-depth inspections and understand the situation, and have initially discovered problems.

　　The Second District Party Committee inspection team found the following main problems in the areas under its jurisdiction:

　　1. Many district and village cadres do not know how to lead production. For more than half a month after the grassroots meetings, the work was only entangled in the meetings to "get through" the masses' thinking, excessively delaying the masses' production time. For example, in a village in Yushe, meetings were held as many as eight times in ten days. A district cadre in Xiguan, Zuoquan, only talked about empty grand principles in the meeting, "From the Soviet period to today, from northern Shaanxi to Zuoquan." The masses were extremely impatient to listen. As for the party's policy of rewarding the people for actively producing, it was not carefully publicized and explained in conjunction with practical actions.

　　2. Regarding the issue of increasing production, there are general plans from the county to the village to the household, but how to achieve the plan and how to solve the existing problems have not been well resolved, either in the county or in the village, thus making some villages' plans for manure application and land repair fall through. Some counties are extremely confused in the plan itself, only vaguely calling for an increase of six liters of grain per mu, and thirty dan of manure per mu; the districts and villages also mechanically copied this.

　　3. On the policy of organizing, although it is said in words to be "flexible, equal value, and smaller is better than larger," in reality, some places are "hardly rectifying," thinking that it is not considered to have the party's leadership without "rectification." For example, mutual aid in a village in Yushe was rectified under the leadership of the village cadres at the beginning of spring, and generally speaking, it was not bad, with no major problems. However, after the district cadres went there, they had to rectify it again, saying, "Without a meeting, how can there be new methods?" Some district cadres in Zuoquan publicized, "This year's mutual aid is voluntary, mutually beneficial, and free to form groups, but whoever does not form a group now will be organized in the future."

　　4. The Zuoquan County Party Committee inspection team has discovered that the masses in Zhizi and Duyu villages have great enthusiasm for production and have achieved good results. The main reason is that the branch secretary and most of the party members actively labor and provide specific leadership. The Zuoquan County Party Committee should report the details.

　　The Third District Party Committee's spring plowing inspection team found that although the Weijiazhuang Village in Lucheng generally set plans during the production mobilization, the task of applying manure was generally not completed. The reason is that there was only a plan but no specific measures to realize the plan, and there was no close inspection and assistance.

　　The Ping Shun County Party Committee inspection team found that the Shi Hui joint defense originally planned to plant 1,400 mu of cotton, but only planted 1,190 mu. The reason was that the branch's leadership on increasing production was perfunctory and did not well explain the North China Government's regulations on cotton being used to pay taxes, so the masses still worried, "If we plant too much cotton, we won't be able to pay public grain. If we sell it outside in our area, we can't even afford the travel expenses, so it's better not to plant it," causing the cotton planting plan not to be completed.

　　Comrade Li Tongren of the Ping Shun County Party Committee led the inspection team to Hanjia Village in the second district and personally inspected the production of eleven party member cadres. They originally planned to apply 65 dan of manure per mu and had already given a false report to the district committee saying that it was "completed." What was the result? Four comrades completed it, six party members completed 27 dan, and one party member only applied 14 dan.

　　The Anyang District Party Committee inspection team dispatched two groups, focusing on She County, Wu'an, Ci County, Lin County, and Anyang. The situation is not yet detailed.

### 太行各地组检查团深入农村推动生产

　　太行各地组检查团深入农村推动生产
    【本报讯】太行区党委办公室综合各地报道：为了及时有效的推进生产运动，太行行署已组织三个检查小组，由行署各处长率领，分赴一、三、五各专区进行检查。在四月二十日左右，各地委、县委纷纷组织检查团，分赴各地，深入检查了解情况，并已初步发现问题。
    二地委检查团发现在该地委区存在以下几个主要问题：
    一、不少区村干部不会领导生产，基点会议后半个多月，工作只是纠缠在会议上“打通”群众思想，过多耽误群众生产时间，如榆社某村十天内开会八次之多。左权西关一个区干部，开会只讲空洞大道理，“从苏维埃时期说到今天，从陕北说到左权”，群众极不耐听，至于党奖励人民积极生产的政策，则未注意结合实际行动认真的进行宣传解释。
    二、增产问题，从县到村到户，一般都有计划，但是如何实现计划，存在的问题如何解决，不论在县在村都没有很好解决，因而使部分村上粪、修地等计划落空。甚至有些县在计划本身，就极其糊涂，只笼统的号召每亩增产六升粮，每亩地上粪三十担；区村也照样的往下死搬。
    三、在组织起来政策上，虽在口头上说的是“灵活、等价、宜小不宜大”，但实际上有些地方确在那里“硬整顿”，认为不加“整顿”就不算是有了党的领导。如榆社某村互助，开春时在村干领导下整顿过，一般说还不错，没大问题。但区干部去后非再整不行，说：“没开会还能有了新办法么？”左权一些区干部宣传说：“今年互助是自愿两利，自由碰组，可是谁现在不碰组，将来还要组织你。”
    四、左权县委检查组，已发现其至、段峪两村群众生产劲头很大成绩较好，其主要原因是支部书记及大部党员自己积极劳动具体领导。详细情况左权县委应作报道。
    三地委的春耕检查团，发现潞城魏家庄村在生产动员时虽普遍定了计划，但是就上粪一项来说一般没完成。其原因是只有计划没有实现计划之具体办法，更没有抓紧检查与帮助。
    平顺县委检查团发现史惠联防原计划种棉一千四百亩，结果只种一千一百九十亩。追其原因：支部对增产领导敷衍，没有很好解释华北政府对棉花可以交负担的规定，所以群众还疑虑“种棉多了没法交公粮，咱这地方往外卖，盘缠（路费）也贴不起，不如不种”，致种棉计划没完成。
    平顺县委李同仁同志带领检查团到二区韩家村，亲自检查了十一户党员干部生产，他们原计划每亩上粪六十五担，而且已给区委作了“完成啦”的假报告，结果呢？四个同志完成了，六个党员完成二十七担，一个党员只上了十四担。
    安阳地委检查团分两组出动，重点是涉县、武安、磁县、林县、安阳。情况未详。
