The Hua University Students in Zhengding

By Our Correspondent Yao Fu

The First Department of North China University in Zhengding has over 4,000 students. Through participation in labor, visiting residents, and democratic life, they have gradually raised their political consciousness. They are new students recently recruited in Tianjin and Beijing. They mainly consist of university and middle school students, freelancers, some former employees of factories and government offices, and a few foreign students and soldiers. They come from almost all provinces in the north and south. Many come from families of small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and landlords, and have lived a relatively comfortable life in the city for a long time.

They Begin to Use Their Own Hands

In the first few days after arriving in Zhengding, many students bought snacks. Teahouses, restaurants, and barbershops were full of "foreign students." Vendors selling roast chicken and candy crowded the school gate, forming a temporary market. Some joked in the streets, some chatted in teahouses, and some idly toured the "Great Buddha Temple." Most of the villagers did not approve of this. After education by the leadership, Class 30 took the initiative to launch a "Rectification of School Spirit Movement," using clapper rhymes, slogans, and cartoons to put forward slogans such as "Revolutionize Yourself First!" and "Maintain the Glorious Tradition of Hua University." The class also made shoulder patches with team numbers and names. Other classes responded one after another, and the rectification campaign began to unfold. This was followed by a school-wide "Life Discipline Week."

They used their own labor to build basketball courts and volleyball courts, and cleaned up the campus, thoroughly removing the stored garbage. From the playground to the courtyard, dormitories, kitchens, and even toilets, everything was cleaned spotlessly and took on a new look.

In the labor, everyone enthusiastically helped each other, using door panels as earth baskets and stone slabs as hoes. Some had blisters on their hands, bled, had red shoulders, and were covered in sweat, but persisted in their work. Shi Zhan and Li Juqiao of Class 33 even picked up dry manure by hand, Class 50 repaired the drainage ditch with smelly mud beside the well, and Class 53 planted a small vegetable garden. The men in Class 38 filled pits, pulled weeds, cleared rotten leaves, and watered trees; the female students cleaned up their personal belongings, wiped walls, and cleaned glass, and began to wash their own clothes. When using Sundays to repair the sports field, some carried, some shoveled, and their spirits were very high. Chi Lian of Class 41 became a labor representative. On the 24th, he started working from 6 am and continued from morning to dusk, despite a nosebleed.

In this way, school slogans were refreshed, and wall newspapers were established inside and outside the school. Some students took out their own medicines for the sick, and some took out colors to paint. The study group leader of Class 58 listened to the lectures during the day and organized notes until midnight that night, and posted them the next day for the whole class to refer to. Three members of the mimeograph group wrote more than eight stencils in one night. A student from Class 32 said: "We are no longer bookworms under the window."

They Began to Understand the Liberated Areas and Found True Teachers

The students gradually came to understand the liberated areas from the many facts they came into contact with. When their team arrived at Liuxinzhuang Station (when they came), the villagers carried boiling water to drink, which was very kind. When they walked to Zhengding at 11 pm, the cooks were already waiting for them at the school gate, preparing boiling water and porridge. Some students took the initiative to launch a consolation campaign, presenting towels, soap, etc., to initially strengthen the relationship between the two sides. The cooking class proposed to ensure that there would be no sandy rice and to cook the rice well. The students were even more educated in their visits to local farmers. Wang Lin of Class 53 visited a local villager, who told him: "You are the future cadres, if you study well, you will serve the people in the future." This made him feel: "As soon as we put on gray clothes, the villagers approached us," which made him understand the glory of "the Communist Party serving the people." Class 48 built a volleyball court, and the ball kept hitting the wheat field. The farmers said to them: "Comrades, please don't damage the wheat." This made them feel that the people in the liberated areas were not afraid of those wearing gray clothes, and dared to express their opinions. When asked about the land issue, poor peasants, middle peasants, and landlords gave them different answers, and they began to understand that different classes have different views. They realized that "the masses are our best teachers."

The Revolutionary Youth League is Rapidly Expanding

The Revolutionary Youth League—is a more mass-based progressive organization under the leadership of the Communist Party, preparing to transition to the Communist Youth League. It was initiated by more than a dozen members of the original People's Youth and People's League and a few Communist Party members in the school. It was formally established in Pingjin on April 1. When all the students went to Zhengding to study, the league members took the lead in organizing luggage, transportation, hygiene, and other groups to be responsible for the affairs during the march. In the process of establishing and electing the student union, the league members conducted criticism and self-criticism with the students to further strengthen unity. Individual league members of Class 33 engaged in sectarianism, which aroused opposition from the masses, and conducted public self-criticism. At the same time, they opposed the extreme emotions of some cynicism. Some league branch committee members of Class 44 had an improper style and were divorced from the masses, and were re-elected. Some people advocated "living in a long-term guest house and receiving long-term meal tickets," not participating in labor group meetings, not abiding by the system, and not taking notes in class, and were educated by everyone. In this way, the prestige of the league was improved, and the organization expanded rapidly. At the League Congress on April 24, more than 820 people took the oath of joining the League, and more than 400 people automatically attended. Finally, more than 300 people scrambled to speak, express their attitudes, expose their thoughts, and request to join the League and the Youth League. The students of Class 41 felt: "This democratic lesson is better than reading ten books."

Turning Revelry into Strength

Unexpectedly, there is such a good learning environment! The courtyard is full of flowers, the vegetables are green, the trees are shady, and the houses are spacious. Just as everyone was happy, the news of "the army crossing the river, the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan" came, and everyone was boiling. Torch parades, street propaganda, shouting until their throats were hoarse. Recently, the request to abolish Sundays was dissuaded, so it was proposed to turn revelry into strength to respond to the school's call to "devote all energy to learning and strive to improve ourselves."

　　在正定的华大同学
    本报记者  药夫
    住正定的华北大学第一部有学生四千余人。他们从参加劳动、访问居民与民主生活中，逐步提高了政治觉悟。他们是不久前在平津招收的新生。其中主要是大、中学生，自由职业者，和一部分工厂机关旧职员，以及个别的外国留学生、军人。他们的籍贯南北各省几乎都有。许多出身于中小资产阶级及地主家庭，在城市长期过着比较优裕生活。
　　他们开始使用自己的双手
    他们刚到正定几天，买零食吃的很多。茶馆、饭店、理发所，到处都是“洋学生”。卖烧鸡、糖果的小贩挤在校门口，成了临时小市。他们有的在街头玩笑，有的在茶馆聊天，有的闲游“大佛寺”。老乡们多半看不惯。经领导上进行教育，三十班自动发起“整顿校风运动”，出了快板、标语、漫画提出“革命先革自己的毛病！”“保持华大光荣传统”等口号。该班并自制了队别、姓名的肩章。别的班纷纷响应，整风便初步展开。接着便展开了全校“生活纪律周”。
    他们用自己的劳动，修建了篮球场、排球场，整理了校园，彻底清除了储存的垃圾。从操场到院子、宿舍、厨房以至厕所，都打扫得干干净净，焕然一新了。
    在劳动中，大家热情互助，以门板代土筐，石板代锹镢。有的手打了泡，流了血，肩膀发红，满头是汗，始终坚持工作。三十三班施展和李菊樵还用手去拾干粪，五十班修了井边积有臭泥土的水道、五十三班种了小片的菜园。三十八班男的填坑、拔草、掀烂树叶、浇树；女同学则整理内务，抹墙壁、擦玻璃，开始自己洗衣服。各班利用星期日修体育场时，抬的抬，铲的铲，精神很愉快。四十一班池廉当了劳动代表。二十四日从早六点开始劳动，鼻子流了血，仍从上午坚持到黄昏。
    这样，学校标语刷新了，校内外建立起墙报。有的同学拿出自己的药品给病号吃，有的拿出颜色来彩画。五十八班学习股长白天听了课，当晚整理笔记到半夜，第三天贴出供全班参考。油印股三人一晚写好过八张腊纸。三十二班生说：“我们不再是伏案窗下的书生了。”
　　开始认识了解放区，找到了真正的老师
    学生们从接触到的许多事实中，逐渐认识了解放区。他们的队伍刚到柳辛庄车站（来的时候），老乡便担来了开水给他们喝，非常亲切。晚十一点走到正定，炊事员早在校门口欢迎他们，准备好了开水和稀饭。部分同学即自动发起慰劳，赠送手巾、肥皂等，初步密切了双方关系。炊事班则提出保证不吃沙子米，把饭作好。在访问当地农民中，同学们更受了教育。五十三班王琳访问当地老乡，老乡对他说：“你们是将来的干部，你们学好了，将来也是给老百姓办事。”使他感到：“刚穿上灰衣服，老乡们就靠近我们了”，这才使他懂得了“共产党为人民服务”的光荣。四十八班建立了排球场，球不断打到麦地里去，农民对他们提出：“同志，请不要打坏麦子”。使他们感到解放区人民对穿灰衣的并不害怕，敢于提出自己的意见。在问到土地问题时，贫农、中农、地主给了他们不同的答复，他们开始领会了不同阶级有不同的观点。认识了“群众就是我们最好的老师”。
　　革命青年联盟在迅速扩大着
    革命青年联盟——是在共产党领导下准备过渡到青年团的更富有群众性的进步组织，由该校原有民青与民联和少数共产党员的十余名发起。四月一日在平正式成立。在全体同学到正定学习三途中，盟员带头组织行李、运输、卫生等组，负责行军中事务工作。在学生会成立与选举的过程中，盟员与同学中进行批评与自我批评，进一步加强了团结。三十三班个别盟员闹宗派，引起群众反对，进行了公开检讨。同时反对了某些冷嘲热讽的偏激情绪。四十四班有的盟支委作风不正派，脱离群众，被改选下去了。有的人主张“住长期招待所，领长期饭票”，不参加劳动小组会，不遵守制度，上课不写笔记，受到了大家的教育。这样，盟的威信提高，组织迅速的扩大了。四月二十四日盟员大会上，有八百二十余人举行入盟宣誓，自动列席者四百余人。最后三百余人争相发言，表示态度，暴露思想，要求入盟入团。四十一班同学们感到：“上了这一次民主课，比读十本书还强”。
　　把狂欢变成力量
    出乎意外，有这么好的学习环境！满院开满鲜花，蔬菜翠绿，树木荫深，房屋宽敞。正当大家高兴之际，“大军渡江，南京，太原解放”的消息传来，大家沸腾了。火炬游行，街头宣传，喊哑了喉咙。最近要求废除星期日被劝止，便提出把狂欢变成力量来响应校部“将全部精力贯彻到学习中去，努力提高自己”的号召。
