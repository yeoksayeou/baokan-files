How Does the Yishui Special District Lead Agricultural Production?
　　Tian Liu

　　I. Consistent Steps and Concentrated Strength of Party and Government Leadership

　　In March and April, each county in the Yishui Special District uniformly organized Party and government cadres to go to the countryside to specifically lead production. In Mancheng County, during the "Tree Planting Assault Decade," nine county cadres went to the countryside, including four from the Industry and Commerce Section who went specifically to the tree planting area to lead tree planting; three from the Civil Affairs Section who mainly led tree planting in conjunction with organizing land cultivation on behalf of revolutionary martyrs and their families; and two from the Education Section who mainly organized production publicity and mobilization work in conjunction with inspecting primary school education. As a result, the county's tree planting and afforestation movement spread widely. In mid-March, the Special Commissioner's Office sent cadres to various counties to specifically lead production meetings. At the propaganda meeting convened by the Prefectural Committee in April, the publicity and education work in the production movement was specially studied. On April 21st, with the Prefectural Committee as the core, more than 20 cadres from the Party, government, and banks in the special district formed two inspection teams to go to various counties to lead drought prevention and cotton sowing.

　　II. Going Deep into the Lower Levels and Paying Attention to Investigation and Research

　　Generally, county magistrates and secretaries of the county Party committees of each county can go deep into the countryside to promptly discover and solve problems. When County Magistrate Jin of Xushui County inspected work in the Third District, he saw that the district office had discarded the tree planting instructions issued by the county and did not pay attention to or study them. In addition to immediately criticizing them, he notified the entire county to draw the cadres' attention to studying production documents. The Tang County Party Committee has implemented district-based leadership to more systematically understand the overall situation and improve leadership effectiveness. When Dingxing County convened a production meeting, it also hired experienced farmers to participate. Initially, some district cadres lacked confidence in leading production. The cadres of the Sixth District originally believed that 50 percent of the district was still uncultivated land and that the cotton planting area in the past was only 12 percent, feeling overwhelmed by difficulties and lacking confidence in completing this year's production plan. However, after humbly consulting with the farmers who first attended the meeting and conducting investigation and research, they obtained the true situation. It turned out that only 20 percent of the district was uncultivated land, and the cotton planting area in the past was more than 20 percent. Therefore, the cadres' confidence greatly increased. Not only were they confident in completing the production plan, but they also revised and improved the county's production plan. Other counties, such as Wangdu and Xushui, also paid attention to in-depth inspection of the effectiveness of their work, and a serious and responsible work attitude was further established.

　　III. Grasping the Agricultural Season and Striving to Take the Initiative to Prepare in Advance

　　This is one of the important reasons why the Yishui Special District achieved success in spring agricultural production. For example, for tree planting and afforestation, last winter, Wangdu, Dingxing, Xushui, and other counties publicized and called on the masses to prepare tree seedlings and sent special personnel to survey the afforestation area. Therefore, the entire district not only completed but also greatly exceeded the tree planting plan. Another example is the development of water conservancy. Last winter, various counties actively supported brick kilns. As a result, the kilns opened early and produced more bricks this spring. By the end of April, 1,957 new wells had been dug, more than one and a half times the annual target of 700 wells. In mid-April, when the drought first appeared, Xushui County convened a special production meeting, calling for "drought prevention and famine preparedness." They dug temporary earthen wells and made full use of existing water conservancy facilities, so the sowing of major autumn crops, especially cotton sowing, could be completed even in the absence of rain.

　　IV. Correcting and Implementing Policies is an Effective Way to Increase the Masses' Production Enthusiasm

　　This spring, Xushui County convened a symposium for livestock breeding households near the city gates and livestock breeding technicians from the entire county to explain in detail the people's government's reward policy for livestock breeding and issued duty exemption certificates to pregnant livestock and breeding livestock on the spot, greatly increasing the breeders' enthusiasm. Therefore, Xushui achieved the greatest success in breeding foals this year, and also purchased the most draft animals. Statistics by the end of April showed that the county had bred 695 foals and purchased 488 draft animals. The experience gained by the Yishui Special District in implementing policies is that on the one hand, the masses must understand the policies, and more importantly, rely on cadres and the masses to earnestly implement the policies. Therefore, the organs that implement policies and laws must resolutely act in accordance with the policies without any hesitation. Therefore, when the Special Commissioner's Office recently found out that "forest certificates" had not been issued universally, and that land certificates had not been issued in time in some areas where land reform had been completed, it immediately instructed various counties to continue issuing them in their leadership of production, in order to dispel the masses' concerns and encourage their enthusiasm for actively developing production and becoming rich.

　　V. Party Members and Cadres Actively Participate in Production and Lead the Masses

　　From the beginning of the production movement to today, the rural Party branches in the Yishui Special District have not stopped their work of encouraging Party members to actively participate in production and leading the masses, and have already achieved results. The role of Party members taking the lead in production is very important. When planting trees in Dachilu Village, Xushui, each Party member guaranteed to plant ten trees, driving all 142 households in the village to actively plant trees. Each household planted an average of eight trees, exceeding the target of five trees per household by 60 percent. In many rural areas, a major competition for leading production has been launched among Party members, and activists have been discovered and cultivated in the competition. For example, Gan Li Laoshuai, a cadre in Daxinzhuang Village, Wangdu County, planted trees on all of his idle land and gave nine tree seedlings to three households to encourage them to plant more trees. This sparked a passion for tree planting throughout the village, with 658 participants planting 3,292 trees. It is not to say that the production movement in the Yishui Special District has been done very well and is perfect. On the contrary, it still has shortcomings, even serious shortcomings, such as the fairly widespread neglect of organizing labor mutual aid, and the complacency of individual regions (Wan, Yi, etc.) with their past "experience" in leading production, resulting in production work that is not as good as in the new areas. There are also gamblers and superstitious people among the displaced people and backward masses in some villages... These are all things that should be improved in a timely manner.

　　易水专区怎样领导农业生产？
    田流
    一、党政领导步调一致力量集中
    三四月间易水专区各县都统一的组织了党政干部下乡，具体领导生产，满城县在“植树突击旬”中，县干部九人下乡，其中实业科四人专赴植树区领导植树，民政科三人以领导植树为主结合组织烈军属代耕，教育科二人主要组织生产宣传动员工作结合视查小学教育，因此该县植树造林运动普遍开展起来。专署在三月中旬即派干部赴各县专门领导生产会议，四月中地委召开的宣传会议上又专门研究了生产运动中的宣传教育工作，四月二十一日以地委为核心的组织了专区党、政、银行等干部二十余人，组成两个检查组赴各县领导防旱及点播棉花。
    二、深入下层注意调查研究
    各县县长和中共县委书记，一般的都能深入农村及时发现和解决问题，徐水靳县长到三区检查工作时，见到区公所把县里发下的植树指示丢在一边不重视不研究，除立时给予批评外并通报全县引起干部注意研究生产文件。唐县县委已实行分区领导，以便更有系统的了解全面情况，提高领导效能。定兴县召开生产会议时，还聘请有经验的农民参加，最初部份区干部对领导生产没信心，六区干部原认为全区尚有白茬地百分之五十，过去植棉面积仅百分之十二，感到困难重重，对完成今年生产计划没信心，经初到会农民虚心请教并进行了调查研究后，才获得了真实的情况。原来，全区白茬仅有百分之二十，过去植棉向在百分之二十以上，因此，干部的信心大增，不但对完成生产计划足具信心，还修改和提高了县里的生产计划。其他如望都、徐水等县，也都注意深入检查工作的实效，认真负责的工作态度进一步的建树起来。
    三、掌握农事季节，争取主动事先作好准备工作
    这是易水专区春季农业生产获得成绩的重要原因之一，如植树造林去年冬天，望、定、徐等县就宣传号召群众准备树秧，并派专人勘定造林区，因此全区不但完成并大大超过了植树计划。又如开展水利，去冬各县便积极扶助砖窑，因此今春开窑早、出砖多，到四月底就完成打新井一千久百五十七眼，已超过全年七百眼的一倍半。徐水县在四月中当旱象初露时，便召开了专门的生产会议，号召“防旱备荒”。挖临时土井，充分利用旧有水利，所以该县的大秋作物播种，特别是棉花播种，就是在天旱不雨的情况下，也能完成。
    四、端正和贯彻政策是提高群众生产情绪的有效办法
    今春徐水县曾召开城关附近村庄母畜饲养户及全县种畜技术人员座谈会，详细宣传解释人民政府关于繁殖牲畜的奖励政策，并当场发给孕畜和种畜减免勤务证，大大提高饲养户的情绪，所以今年徐水繁殖小驹成绩最大，购买的耕畜也最多，到四月底统计全县已繁殖小驹六百九十五头，购买耕畜四百八十八头。在贯澈政策中易水专区得到的经验是一方面要群众了解政策，更重要的是依靠干部群众认真的执行政策，因此执行政策法令的机关，必须决不动摇的按政策办事，不能有丝毫迁就，所以当专署最近检查出：没有普遍发“林木证”，有些地区虽土地改革已经完成也没有及时发土地证后，立时指示各县在领导生产中继续颁发，以解除群众顾虑，激励群众积极生产发家致富的热情。
    五、党员干部积极生产带领群众
    从生产运动开始到今天，易水专区农村党的支部工作，对党员的积极生产激励党员带领群众的教育工作就没有停止过，而且已经获得了成绩、党员带头搞生产、作用是很大的，徐水大赤鲁村植树时，每个党员保证栽十棵树，带动全村一百四十二户都积极植树了，平均每户植了八棵，超过每户五棵的百分之六十。在好多农村中，党员间开展了领导生产的大竞赛，并在竞赛中发现和培养积极分子，如望都县大辛庄村干李老帅在植树时把自己的闲地方都栽上树，并送给三户九棵树秧，激励他们多栽树，这样掀起了全村植树热情，参加者六百五十八人，植树三千二百九十二棵，并不是说易水专区的生产运动已经作得很好十全十美了，相反，它还有缺点甚至是严重的缺点，如相当普遍的忽视组织劳动互助，个别地区（完、易等县）满足于过去领导生产的“经验”而表现麻痹，结果生产工作还不如新区搞的好，还有部份村庄中的流民和落后群众中闹赌博闹迷信……这些都是应该及时改进的。
