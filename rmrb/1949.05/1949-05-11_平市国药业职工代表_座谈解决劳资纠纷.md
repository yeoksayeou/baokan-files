In order to lead the resolution of some existing problems in the national pharmaceutical industry under the premise of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, the Ping City Federation of Trade Unions held a symposium of employee representatives from the Ping City national pharmaceutical industry yesterday (the 9th) to solicit opinions from the employees. Employee representatives from 21 national pharmaceutical companies, including Tongrentang, attended. The meeting mainly discussed the biggest problem currently existing in the national pharmaceutical industry—labor-management disputes—and how to resolve them satisfactorily. The employee representatives first introduced the labor-management situation of their respective pharmacies. The speeches indicated that since the liberation of Ping City, employees in the industry generally have demanded improved treatment. Over the past few months, some problems have been resolved relatively well, in line with the spirit of benefiting both labor and capital, while others have not been resolved well, leading to disputes. Checking the effects, it can be seen that wherever problems have been reasonably resolved, the enthusiasm of both labor and capital has been enhanced, and production and economy have been achieved. Tongrentang and other pharmacies are examples of this situation. Macro-Benevolence Hall and other pharmacies have not been able to resolve the problems, and the production enthusiasm of both labor and capital has been affected. In addition, some problems have been resolved, but there are still many inappropriate aspects in the resolution process, and both or one party still has many opinions that need to be improved. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Zijiu of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions spoke, pointing out that everyone should resolve these problems based on the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and it is wrong to only consider one-sided interests. How to solve it specifically? He proposed: (1) After the meeting, everyone should widely publicize the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, (2) hold another mass meeting of employees from various factories in a few days to clarify the policy, and (3) establish a national pharmaceutical industry employees’ union, starting with the establishment of a preparatory committee. In this way, on the one hand, the policy is explained to everyone, and at the same time, the policy should also be explained to the capitalists—the trade association of the national pharmaceutical industry. After everyone understands the policy, they should organize and then use organized action to discuss with the capitalists—the national pharmaceutical industry’s trade association—to solve the labor-management disputes. These opinions were unanimously approved by the employee representatives who attended the meeting. The employee representatives also raised and studied issues such as how to generate the preparatory committee members, and unanimously agreed. After the meeting, they will immediately publicize the policy and prepare for organization. The meeting lasted from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

    平市国药业职工代表
    座谈解决劳资纠纷
    【本报讯】在发展生产劳资两利的前提下，平市总工会为了领导解决国药业当前所存在着的一些问题，于昨（九）日首先召开平市国药业职工代表座谈会，征求职工方面意见。到有同仁堂等二十一家国药业的职工代表。会议主要是讨论当前国药业中存在的最大问题——劳资纠纷及如何圆满地解决它。到会职工代表首先介绍各该药店的劳资情况。从发言中，说明自平市解放后，该业职工普遍地有改善待遇的要求，几个月来，有的问题解决的比较好，合乎劳资两利的精神，有的解决得不好，致发生了纠纷。从效果上来检查，凡合理解决了问题的，劳资双方积极性均提高了，生产节约均有成绩，同仁堂等药店就是这种情形。问题尚未能解决的，有宏仁堂等药店，劳资双方生产情绪均受到影响。此外，有的问题虽已解决，而解决中还存在很多不恰当处，双方或一方还有较多意见，需要改善。会中，全总刘子久同志发言，指出，大家应本劳资两利的政策来解决这些问题，只顾单方面的利益是不对的。怎样具体解决呢？他提议：（一）大家开会回去后，要广泛宣传劳资两利的政策，（二）过几天后再开个各厂职工群众大会，来讲明政策，（三）建立国药业职工会，首先成立筹备会。这样一方面向大家说明了政策，同时，也要向资方讲明政策。大家明白了政策之后，就要组织起来，然后以组织的行动来同资方——国药业的同业公会共同商讨解决劳资纠纷的办法。这些意见，到会职工代表一致赞成。各职工代表并提出研究了筹备委员如何产生等问题，一致同意。会后即宣传政策、酝酿组织。会议自下午一时起，至五时结束。
