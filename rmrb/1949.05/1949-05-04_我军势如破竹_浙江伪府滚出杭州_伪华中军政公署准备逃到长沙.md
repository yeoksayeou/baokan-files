Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Under the shock of the People's Liberation Army's triumphant offensive after crossing the Yangtze River, the rear of the Kuomintang bandit gang is becoming increasingly chaotic. Although Zhou Yan, the puppet governor of Zhejiang province, was still bragging on the 26th of last month that "unless we fight to the last man, the provincial government will never move out of Hangzhou," as a result of the People's Liberation Army's rapid advance along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, only three days later, on the 29th of last month, the heads of various departments and offices of the Zhejiang puppet provincial government, led by Sheng Zhu, the secretary-general of the puppet provincial government, carried their documents and belongings and fled Hangzhou, heading for Ningbo. The next day, the 30th, even the Kuomintang bandit army's "Hangzhou Garrison Command" and the city's police fled across the Qiantang River. The 600,000 citizens of Hangzhou are now eagerly awaiting the arrival of the People's Liberation Army's banners. The defending enemy in Hankou is also extremely panicked. The puppet Hubei provincial government announced on the 30th that it would flee from Hankou to Enshi in western Hubei. The puppet Central China Military and Political Headquarters is also preparing to flee from Hankou to Changsha. Bai Chongxi has already stolen and transported most of the materials and equipment of the troops under the jurisdiction of the puppet headquarters to Hengyang in southern Hunan. The bandit army under Bai Chongxi's command has begun to flee south via Changsha. Due to the Kuomintang bandit gang's excessive issuance of paper money and exorbitant taxes, industry and commerce in Hankou continue to collapse on a large scale. On the 30th alone, nine money shops, three banks, eighteen leather shops, and three flour mills closed down. The Kuomintang bandit gang in Changsha has implemented a "curfew" since the 28th and announced a strict ban on gatherings and demonstrations. Cheng Qian's "Changsha Pacification Headquarters" is preparing to flee to Shaoyang. The trend of store closures in Changsha is severe, with more than 20 silk, general merchandise, and rice stores already closed. The Kuomintang bandit gang in Shanghai continues to frantically arrest students. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 30th, another 200 students have been arrested in the past few days. Prices in Shanghai continue to rise wildly. On the 30th, the prices of daily necessities such as rice, vegetables, meat, and cigarettes suddenly increased several times. The Kuomintang bandit gang that fled to Guangzhou is stepping up the excessive issuance of paper money and extortion, deepening the suffering of the local people. They are抢占 and forcibly occupy large numbers of houses, causing a serious housing shortage. In the past few days, rents have doubled.

    伪华中军政公署准备逃到长沙
    【新华社北平二日电】在渡过长江的人民解放军的势如破竹的攻势震撼下，国民党匪帮后方日趋混乱。尽管浙江伪省主席周ｙáｎ＠①上月二十六日还在瞎吹“除非战至一兵一卒，省府决不迁出杭州”，但由于人民解放军沿京杭国道猛进的结果，仅仅三天之后，即上月二十九日，浙江伪省政府各厅处长就在伪省府秘书长盛铸率领之下携带文件家当滚出了杭州，向宁波逃去。再过了一天，即三十日，连国民党匪军“杭州城防司令部”和全市的警察也逃过了钱塘江。杭州六十万市民现正殷切地期待着人民解放军旌旗的到达。汉口守敌亦极为恐慌。湖北伪省政府已于三十日宣布自汉口逃往鄂西恩施。伪华中军政公署亦准备自汉口逃往长沙，白匪崇禧已将该伪公署所辖部队的物资装备大部盗运至湖南南部的衡阳，白匪所辖匪军已开始经长沙南逃。由于国民党匪帮的滥发纸币和横征暴敛，汉口工商各业继续大量陷于破产。三十日一天之内即有钱业九家，银行三家，皮业十八家，面粉厂三家歇业。长沙国民党匪帮已自二十八日起实行“宵禁”，并宣布严禁集会游行，程潜的“长沙绥靖公署”已准备逃往邵阳。长沙商店倒风甚烈，绸缎百货米店倒闭者已达二十余家。上海国民党匪帮继续疯狂逮捕学生，据合众社上海三十日电称，过去数日又有两百名学生被捕。上海物价继续疯狂上涨，三十日一日内，大米、蔬菜、肉类、纸烟等日用品价格都猛然上涨数倍。逃集广州的国民党匪帮，正加紧滥发纸币，敲诈勒索，加深该地人民的苦难。他们纷纷抢占和强占大量房屋，引起了严重的房荒，在过去几天内，房租已涨了两倍。
