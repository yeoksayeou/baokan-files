　　Triumphant News from the Production Front in April:
    All Three State-Owned Coal Mines in Mentougou Exceeded Their Planned Coal Production
    [Our Dispatch] Reporters Ke Ren and Wei Jin report: The Mentou, Xishan, and Chengzi three state-owned coal mines in the Mentougou mining area have initially summarized the glorious achievements of launching the first production campaign in April to welcome "May Day". The largest Mentougou Coal Mine originally planned to produce 35,250 tons of coal in April, but actually produced 39,520 tons, exceeding the plan by 4,270 tons. Compared with the 31,030 tons of coal produced in March before the competition, it exceeded by 8,470 tons. The average coal production efficiency per person per day (referring to underground coal mining) was 0.6240 tons, exceeding March's 0.47 tons by 0.154 tons, and exceeding the pre-liberation peak efficiency (May last year) of 0.55 tons by 0.074 tons. The Xishan Coal Mine originally planned to produce 9,000 tons of coal in April, but despite being affected by 26 power outages (totaling 89 hours), it still produced 10,199 tons of coal, exceeding the plan by 1,199 tons. The Chengzi Coal Mine originally planned to produce 4,200 tons of coal in April, but actually produced 4,584 tons, exceeding the plan by 384 tons. Compared with the 3,123 tons of coal produced in March, it exceeded by 1,461 tons. The average coal production efficiency per person per day was 0.2 tons, exceeding March's 0.153 tons by 0.047 tons. Under the promotion of 36 hero models, the Chengzi Coal Mine not only exceeded the coal production plan, but also saved a large amount of materials. In March before the competition, when blasting coal, the average consumption of explosives per ton of coal was 0.181 cm and 0.727 detonators. In April, the average consumption of explosives per ton of coal was only 0.169 cm and 0.485 detonators.

　　四月份生产战线上的捷报：
    门头沟三大国营煤矿均超过预订产煤计划
    【本报讯】记者克仁、维进报道：门头沟矿区门头、西山、城子三大国营煤矿，初步总结四月份迎接“五一”展开第一次生产大竞赛的辉煌成绩。规模最大的门头沟煤矿，原计划四月份出煤三万五千二百五十吨，结果出煤三万九千五百二十吨，超过四千二百七十吨，较竞赛前的三月份出煤三万一千零三十吨，超过八千四百七十吨。每人每天平均产煤效率（指煤井下的）六二四○·吨，较三月份的○·四七吨，超过○·一五四吨，较解放前的最高效率（去年五月份）○·五五吨，超过○·○七四吨。西山煤矿原计划四月份出煤九千吨，虽受停电二十六次（共合八十九小时）的影响，结果仍出煤一万零一百九十九吨，超过一千一百九十九吨。城子煤矿原计划四月份出煤四千二百吨，结果出煤四千五百八十四吨，超过三百八十四吨，较三月份出煤三千一百二十三吨，超过一千四百六十一吨。每人每天平均出煤效率○·二吨，较三月份的○·一五三吨。超过○·○四七吨。城子煤矿在三十六名英雄模范推动下，全矿不仅超过出煤计划，还节省大批材料。在竞赛前的三月份，放炮崩煤时，每吨煤平均消耗炸药○·一八一公分，及消耗雷管○·七二七个，四月份每吨煤平均只消耗炸药○·一六九公分，及消耗雷管○·四八五个。
