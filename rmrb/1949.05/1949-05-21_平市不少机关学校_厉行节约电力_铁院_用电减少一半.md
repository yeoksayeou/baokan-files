Many Institutions and Schools in Beiping
  Practice Economy in Electricity Use
  "Railway Institute" Reduces Electricity Consumption by Half
    [This newspaper reports] Since the Beiping Branch of the North China Electric Power Company issued a proposal on saving electricity to all electricity users in the city on the 5th of this month, it has recently consulted thirty-five institutions and schools on the progress of saving electricity. It is understood that the issue of electricity saving has indeed attracted the attention of some institutions, schools, and factories, and they have begun to implement electricity saving based on the suggestions. The first step taken by the Finance Department of the North China Government to save electricity is to reduce the brightness of lights. The Supervisory Yuan, after discussion at a meeting, has replaced light bulbs with those of 50 watts or less. The Industry and Commerce Bureau of the Beiping Municipal Government stipulates that office lights should be turned off when not in use, and dormitories should have one light per room, with light bulbs limited to 15 watts. The Dazhong Daily has stipulated electricity usage times and shortened typesetting time. The dormitory lights at Peking University have been reduced to 25 watts, opening and closing times have been set, and it has been suggested that the electric power company formulate detailed measures for saving electricity and publish the electricity consumption of various institutions and groups each month for comparison. The Student Union of the Teachers College has specifically set out electricity-saving measures for turning lights on and off and published big-character posters to draw students' attention. The working group of the Fourth District and Eighteenth Street of this city has also conducted inspections, finding that a 100-watt light bulb in the West Room dormitory had not been turned off for two nights, and the electricity bill for April exceeded the quota by 243 yuan. In the future, it is planned to have two lights in two offices, replace the 100-watt light bulbs with 15-watt ones, and stipulate that lights must be turned off when sleeping. Youth League members at the Railway Institute have automatically reduced the use of electric stoves and lights in dormitories and turn the power on and off according to regulations. Before liberation, the school needed 1,440 kilowatt-hours of electricity every ten days; now it takes twenty days to use 1,434 kilowatt-hours. Before liberation, the Mongolian-Tibetan School used 350 jin of coal per boiler per day; now it uses 200 jin per day. Some students would rather grope in the dark than turn on the lights when they go to bed at night. Some students gather together in groups of four or five to read at night, unlike before when each person had a lamp.
    The company hopes that all institutions, schools, factories, and all electricity users will pay attention to the electricity-saving suggestions, formulate electricity-saving plans, and provide suggestions for revising the electricity-saving measures proposed by the company in order to carry out the electricity-saving campaign.
                                                                                                (Bai Qing)

　　平市不少机关学校
  　厉行节约电力
  　“铁院”用电减少一半
    【本报讯】华北电业公司北平分公司本月五日向全市各用电户发出节电建议后，又于日前分别向三十五个机关、学校单位征询节约用电进行情形。据了解节电问题确已引起一部分机关、学校、工厂注意，根据建议开始实行节电。华北政府财政部节电第一步是将灯光缩小。监察院经开会讨论后，已换装五十瓦以下之灯泡。北平市政府工商局规定办公室灯随手关灯，宿舍每室一灯，灯泡以十五瓦为限。大众日报社已规定用电时间，并缩短排字时间。北京大学宿舍灯光已减为二十五瓦，定出开闭时间，并建议电业公司订出节电详细办法，每月公布各机关、团体用电情况，以做比较。师大学生会具体定出开闭电灯的节约办法，并出版大字报引起同学们注意。本市四区十八街工作组并作了检查，检查出西房寝室一百瓦的灯泡有两夜未熄四月分电费即超过定额二百四十三元。今后计划两个办公室设两盏灯，把一百瓦的灯泡换一个十五瓦的，并规定睡觉时必须关灯。铁院青年团员已自动将宿舍的电炉、电灯减少、按规定开闭电门。解放前该校每十天需电一千四百四十度，现在二十天才用一千四百三十四度。蒙藏学校解放前一个锅炉每日用煤三百五十斤，现每日用二百斤。有的同学晚上睡觉时，宁肯摸黑也不开灯。有的同学晚上四五个人凑在一起看书，不象以前每人一盏灯了。
    该公司希望各机关、学校、工厂及所有用电户重视节电建议，都订出节电计划，并对该公司提出的节电办法提出修改意见，以便开展节电运动。
