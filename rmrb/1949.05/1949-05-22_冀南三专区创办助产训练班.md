　　Jinnan Third Special District Establishes Midwifery Training Class
　　[Jinnan Dispatch] To reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, the Jinnan Third Special District established a midwifery training class. In early April, the Women's Committee, the Commissioner's Office, and the hospital jointly selected forty-one elementary school teachers and village cadres for training, which lasted for twenty-one days. The teaching policy was to clarify feudal superstitious ideas and instill scientific midwifery knowledge, with young and old, intellectuals and worker-peasant cadres mixed into groups. Due to insufficient mobilization, the trainees were initially unstable in their emotions. For example, teachers were afraid of changing careers, and young women thought it was degrading and shameful to be a midwife. Others held feudal superstitious ideas such as "it's hard to have a son if it's not in the cards," and "labor pains are a punishment for sins." In response to these ideas, we first explained that midwifery is a glorious work that directly saves lives and is related to the prosperity of the country's population, establishing the trainees' viewpoint of serving the people. Secondly, scientific midwifery knowledge replaced the idea of "fate." The trainees' enthusiasm for learning became even higher. In various internships, they were very attentive. When discussing physiological changes, everyone spoke enthusiastically, overcoming the initial phenomenon of blushing when talking about physiology. After learning, they generally mastered simple disinfection methods for deliveries, prenatal hygiene, placental removal, and treatment of common problems during labor, realizing that infant mortality in rural areas is mostly caused by superstition and unsanitary conditions. The trainees have now been dispatched to work in various places.

　　冀南三专区创办助产训练班
    【冀南电】冀南三专区为减少妇婴疾病死亡，创办助产训练班。四月初由妇委会、专署、医院联合调集小学教员、村干部共四十一人受训，历时二十一日结束。教学方针为澄清封建迷信思想，贯输科学的助产知识，青壮与老年，知识分子与工农干部混合编组。由于动员不够成熟，开始学员情绪不稳，如教员怕转业，青年妇女认为当收生婆下贱丢人。另有些人存有命里无儿难求子，产妇肚疼是有罪等封建迷信思想，根据以上思想，首先讲明助产是直接救人，关系国家人口兴旺的光荣工作，树立了学员为人民服务的观点。其次，以科学的助产常识，代替了“命运”思想。学员学习情绪更为高涨。在各种实习中，都很用心，讨论生理变化时，大家都热烈发言，克服开始谈生理即红脸的现象。经过学习，一般的都学会了收生简单消毒法、孕妇卫生、胎盘取法、和产期易出的毛病治法，认识到乡间婴儿的死亡，多是迷信、不卫生所致。现学员们已分赴各地工作。
