Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 14th. Over four thousand people in Guixi City gathered on the 6th to celebrate their liberation and welcome the People's Liberation Army's southward advance and the Min-Zhe-Gan Column. People's representatives presented the Liberation Army with red flags and flowers, calling them "Saviors of the People." Farmers from the Tangwan Township area, more than fifty miles south of the city, collected over twenty pigs and two hundred chickens and ducks, and beat gongs and drums to bring them into the city to comfort the Liberation Army. The area northeast of Guixi was originally the Min-Zhe-Gan border region during the Land Revolution. When the farmers there learned that the Liberation Army had arrived, every village boiled water to welcome them. Men and women farmers lined both sides of the road for more than ten miles to see their own troops. Many people excitedly said to the Liberation Army soldiers passing by, "For more than ten years, we have been waiting for you."

　　贵溪人民欢天喜地
  　庆祝解放慰劳军队
    【新华社浙赣前线十四日电】贵溪人民四千余人六日在城内集会，庆祝自己的解放，并欢迎人民解放军南下大军及闽浙赣纵队，人民代表以“人民救星”的红旗与鲜花献给解放军。城南五十多里塘湾镇地区的农民筹集了二十多口猪和二百多只鸡鸭，敲打着锣鼓送进城来慰劳解放军。贵溪东北一带地区原是土地革命时代闽浙赣边区，那里的农民得知解放军来到，村村都烧了开水，迎接解放军，大道两旁十几里以外的男女农民，都跑来看自己的队伍。许多人都激动地向路过的解放军战士们说：“十几年来，我们盼望的就是你们。”
