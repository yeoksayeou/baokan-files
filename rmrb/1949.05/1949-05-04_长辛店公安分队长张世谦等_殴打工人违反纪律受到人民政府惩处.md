    长辛店公安分队长张世谦等
    殴打工人违反纪律受到人民政府惩处
    【本报讯】长辛店公安分局的分队长张世谦队员张万明违反了共产党的政策，违反了公安队员起码的纪律，丧失了公安队员为人民服务的立场的军阀主义作风，已受到人民政府的惩处。在五月二日下午四时，当东北马戏团在长辛店演马戏时，公安分局的队长张广健、张世谦队员张万明等，因观众拥挤，维持秩序，捆打了长辛店铁路机车厂工人杨江，北平市委会，市人民政府、市职工总会筹备会平津铁路局政治部、市公安局等机关得到报告后，马上派负责同志，连夜赶赴长辛店调查经过，即予处理，在昨日下午四时半由长辛店铁路局机车厂职工会筹委会召开了工人大会，工人们讨论了这件事以后，一致认为公安局是工人自己的，是人民的，个别队员违反了纪律，应由个人负责。随后打人的队长队员张广健、张世谦、女检查员李玉芝等当场向工人道歉并承认错误，长辛店公安分局杨局长也特向工人表示歉意。最后由公安局局长谭政文同志宣布中队长张广健撤职，分队长张世谦撤职禁闭，队员张万明送人民法院依法惩办，女检查员李玉芝亦将议处，对队员吕永棠加以警告，工人对人民政府此种措置一致拥护，至晚九时散会。
