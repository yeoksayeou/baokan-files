    "Returning to the Ranks": On the Performance of "The Red Flag Song"
    Hua University Third Performing Arts Troupe
    When we were performing "The Red Flag Song" in Shijiazhuang, the Great Prosperity Cotton Mill Workers' Union sent a letter of encouragement, which included the sentence: "Welcome back to the ranks." This gave us a great education. Yes, in the past it was as if we were wandering outside, but now we have found our own ranks, returned to the ranks of the proletariat. The proletariat's strength is unparalleled; it led the victory of the Chinese revolution and is creating a new society. Today, having come from the countryside to the city, we primarily rely on the workers, and we must serve them wholeheartedly. And in establishing the city's cultural front, the development of a "for the workers" drama movement undoubtedly has extremely important significance.
    Therefore, we bravely took on the task of rehearsing and performing "The Red Flag Song." Although our strength is still very weak, and the time is so short: The first performance in Shimen, from the creation of the script to the rehearsals to the performance, took only three weeks. This second performance is the same; from revising the script to rehearsing to performing, it has been less than three weeks. Obviously, this is a crash project. In the first half of this work, we lived in the Great Prosperity Cotton Mill for a month, learning from the workers, inviting them to watch the rehearsals, and giving us many instructions, as our mentors. In short, this work, under such a crash condition, brought forth the collective strength, especially in learning from the workers, which strengthened our confidence in the work.
    This performance of "The Red Flag Song" certainly has many shortcomings. We hope everyone will offer many suggestions, especially hoping that the worker comrades will give more criticism and guidance, so that we can learn to master this artistic weapon and express the working class's great enthusiasm for creating a new society through labor.

    “归队”  关于“红旗歌”的演出
    华大第三文工团
    当我们在石家庄演出“红旗歌”的时候，大兴纱厂职工会来信鼓励，其中有一句话说：“欢迎你们归队”，这给与我们很大的教育。是的，过去好象流落在外边，如今找到了自己的队伍，归到无产阶级的队伍中来了，无产阶级它的力量是无比的，它领导了中国革命的胜利，它创造着新的社会。今天，从乡村进到城市了，在这里主要的依靠工人，我们必需全心全意的为他服务。而在建立城市的文化战线来说：“为工人”剧运的开展，无疑的，有其极重大的意义。
    因此，我们勇敢地担负起“红旗歌”排演工作。虽然我们的力量还很薄弱，时间又是那么短：第一次在石门的演出，从剧本的创作到排演到出演，只有三个星期的时间，这回第二次演出，也同样的，从修改剧本到排演到演出，不够三个星期的时间，很显然，这是一个突击的工作，在这一工作的前半段，我们到大兴纱厂生活了一个月的时间，向工人学习，请他们看排演，给我们许多的指示，当我们的导师。总之，这个工作是在这样突击的状态下，发挥集体的力量，尤其在向工人的学习中加强了工作的信心。
    红旗歌这次的演出，一定有很多的缺点，希望大家多多的给提意见，尤其希望工人同志们多多批评指示，使我们能够学习着掌握这个艺术的武器，表现工人阶级创造新社会的伟大的劳动的热情。
