　　Ji-Lu-Yu Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation

　　Over 1.5 Million Mu Planted with Cotton; Many Obstacles to Peanut Sowing; Relaxed Sowing of Grain Crops
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] As of the middle of this month, the planting situation of economic crops and food crops in this area is as follows: Generally, various places have sufficient confidence in the cotton planting plan. According to existing materials, it is estimated that the total cotton planting area in the region reaches more than 1.5 million mu, of which American cotton accounts for more than one-third of the total cotton fields. Early planting has already sprouted. Regarding peanut sowing, most special districts lack sufficient confidence. The reasons are the lack of seeds and insufficient publicity and mobilization. Especially in areas where there is no previous habit of planting peanuts, the masses have not personally experienced the benefits of planting peanuts, and there are generally more concerns: such as fear that the government will buy at low prices in the future, fear of excessive taxation, and fear that there will be no sales if too much is planted. Some areas also have specific difficulties, such as the geology of the Ninth Special District is not suitable for planting peanuts, more wheat was planted last autumn, there is less spring land, and sorghum and millet are connected earlier, while peanuts mature late and cannot be used urgently, they have no seeds of their own, and the market price is too expensive to afford. Based on the above situation, cadres in various places must deeply understand the concerns of the masses, and then specifically publicize and explain the various production policies of the Party and the government, explaining the benefits and sales channels of planting peanuts, etc.; secondly, help the masses solve specific difficulties such as seeds, capital, and labor. Villages where the above two points are done more thoroughly have completed all or most of the planting plan. Conversely, the planting area is far from the original plan. Generally, in sandy areas where the masses have the habit of planting peanuts, such as Neihuang, and with government loans and mobilization, the number of plantings is relatively large, such as 90,000 mu in Neihuang alone. The sowing of food crops, such as sorghum and millet, has not been specifically arranged. In addition, due to the task perspective of the cadres, the leadership in various places has paid less attention to this, resulting in a significant reduction in the sowing area. Sorghum was sown by the beginning of this month and has already sprouted. Now it is starting to thin the seedlings and hoe the first time. Millet has also been mostly planted.

　　冀鲁豫半月农情
  　植棉百五十余万亩  花生播种障碍尚多　粮食作物播种放松
    【冀鲁豫讯】截止本月中为止，本区经济作物与粮食作物播种情况如下：各地对种棉计划一般信心充足，据现有材料估计：全区棉花播种总面积达一百五十余万亩，其中美棉约占棉田总面积三分之一强。早种的已经出苗。花生播种方面，大部专县缺乏足够信心。其原因为种籽缺乏与宣传动员不深入。尤其以往无种花生习惯，群众尚未亲身体验到种花生利益的地区，一般顾虑较多：如怕将来政府低价收买，怕多征税，怕种的多了没有销路等。有些地区也有具体困难，如九专区地质不适于种花生，去秋种麦较多，春地少，加之高粱、谷子接口较早，而花生成熟晚不能当急，自家无种籽，市价又贵买不起等。根据上述情况，各地干部必须深入了解群众顾虑，然后具体的宣传和解释党和政府的各项生产政策，讲明种花生的利益及销路等；其次，帮助群众解决具体困难，如种籽、资本、劳力等。凡是以上两点做的较深入的村庄，便全部或大部完成了播种计划。反之，其播种面积与原订计划均相距甚远。一般沙质地带，群众有种花生习惯的如内黄等地，又经政府贷款贷种及动员号召，播种数量较大，如内黄一地即种九万亩。食粮作物的播种，如高粱、谷子等，未做具体布置。加之干部的任务观点，故各地领导对此较为忽视，致播种面积大为减少。高粱本月初即播种完毕，已经出苗，现正开始剔苗及锄头遍，谷子亦大部种完。
