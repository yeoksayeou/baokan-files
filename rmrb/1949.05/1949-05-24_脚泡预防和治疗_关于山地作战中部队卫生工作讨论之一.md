　　Prevention and Treatment of Foot Blisters
    ——One of the Discussions on Troop Hygiene Work in Mountain Operations
    Bai Bingqiu
    Last spring, before our army advanced into Chahar South, the troops received education on preventing foot blisters. However, after being away from mountainous areas for more than a year and fighting on the plains of central Hebei, the phenomenon of foot blisters became widespread once we stepped into mountainous areas again. According to a survey conducted during six days of marching at that time, some companies had blister rates of over 50% of the company's total personnel, with new recruits accounting for over 43% of those with blisters. This serious blistering greatly weakened the improvement of our army's marching ability and also caused one of the unnecessary non-combat attrition reasons for the troops (some units had as many as twenty people sent to the hospital for suppuration due to foot blisters). Later, after the medical staff of the troops promptly summarized their experience and earnestly carried out "foot blister prevention" education, and many doctors went deep into the company platoons during the troop march or rest, timely helping the health workers to check and treat, therefore, in the expanded victory of Chahar South, from Chahar South to eastern Hebei, from eastern Hebei to northern Chahar, the phenomenon of shouting due to foot blisters affecting the marching ability of the troops in the early stage of entering Chahar South was basically overcome.
    Why did such a serious foot blistering phenomenon occur? Based on the investigation materials of various troops, the following opinions are put forward as a reference for our research on mountain marching hygiene and for the prevention of foot blisters in each company.
    First, the parts prone to blistering:
    1. The connection between the plantar and the toes, especially the base of the big toe and the third toe.
    2. The joint of the dorsum of the foot.
    3. The ball of the big toe and the ball of the small toe on the side of the foot.
    4. The heel, the back of the heel, and the toe seams.
    Second, the main reasons for blistering:
    1. Shoes and socks are too big or too small: socks are too narrow and small, and the instep of the shoes is too low.
    2. Shoes and socks are made of rough material: the knots on the soles of the shoes are too thick, the rope ends are left too long, the folded edges are too wide, and the edges are uneven.
    3. Often active in the plains, lacking experience in walking mountain roads.
    4. Wearing new shoes or thin-soled shoes.
    5. Irregular marching speed, marching thirty li at the start without time to adjust shoes and socks in between (especially the first march after rest).
    6. Imbalanced clothing, making walking difficult.
    7. Shoes, socks, and foot wraps are both dirty and contain sand and mud.
    8. Poor administrative management education, some wash their feet at the camp, others don't, failing to create a habit of washing feet after marching (Snow Mountain Department Third Company advocates three no-sleeps: (1) no soaking feet, no sleep; (2) no drinking boiled water, no sleep; (3) no opening the quilt, no sleep).
    Third, various prevention methods:
    1. Improve the manufacture of shoes and socks: the inside of the shoes should be sewn flat, try not to leave long rope ends, add a protective cloth on the bottom, and the folded edges should be as wrinkle-free as possible when sewing the shoes. The sock cuff should be wide and moderate.
    2. When the troops are resting, the administration should pay attention to adjusting shoes and socks, trying to find suitable sizes.
    3. Wear new shoes during training, and try to wear half-new and half-old shoes when marching. If wearing new shoes, use a hammer to soften them. Fasten shoelaces well when marching.
    4. When the troops set out, they should start slowly and then speed up. Especially after the first departure, it is best to rest every fifteen li to allow everyone to adjust shoes and socks, backpacks, etc.
    5. Conduct clothing inspections before marching to ensure a steady and comfortable walk. When walking, swing both arms, choose targets for each step, and avoid walking and stepping randomly.
    6. Wash your feet every day after marching to keep your soles, socks, and foot wraps clean. When resting on the go, perform exercises such as dumping soil and inverting the feet (raise your legs high and massage the lower legs with both hands during rest).
    Fourth, treatment:
    Keep the soles, shoes, and socks clean to prevent infection and suppuration. Avoid cutting them open, prompting them to drain naturally and promoting rapid drying.
    Generally, light foot blisters, as long as you pay attention to soaking your feet and rest overnight, will not hinder continued marching. However, when continuing to march, wrap the area with blisters well with cotton to prevent continued development.
    For more severe blisters, you can choose from the following methods:
    ① After applying iodine, use a sterilized needle (burn with fire) to pierce and drain the fluid.
    ② After applying iodine locally, use sterilized horsehair or hair to thread it, or apply kerosene.
    ③ Lime paste: Mix half quicklime and half white flour with some water (clean) and apply it to the blistered area.
    Whenever a more severe blister occurs, treat it immediately, wrap it well with cotton, and it can be cured in one or two days. Generally, suppuration will not occur and affect the march.

　　脚泡预防和治疗
    ——关于山地作战中部队卫生工作讨论之一
    白冰秋
    去年春，我大军挺进察南前，部队曾进行预防打脚泡的教育，但由于一年多离开山地，转战冀中大平原；一旦又踏进山岳地带作战，便普遍地发生打脚泡的现象。据当时六天行军中调查统计，有的连队占全连人数５０％以上，其中新战士占打泡人数４３％以上。这些严重打脚泡现象，大大削弱我军行军力的提高，而且也造成部队不应有的非战斗减员原因之一（有的单位因打脚泡而化脓送院者达二十名之多）。后经部队医务工作同志及时总结经验，认真开展“防脚泡”教育；并在部队行军中或休息时，许多医生深入连队班排，及时帮助卫生员进行检查并治疗，故在扩大察南胜利中，从察南而冀东，从冀东而察北，基本上克服了进入察南初期因打脚泡影响部队行军力而叫喊的现象。
    为什么发生这样严重的打脚泡现象呢？综合各部队调查材料，特提出如下几点意见，作为我们研究山地行军卫生，各连队进行预防脚泡教育的参考。
    第一、打泡的部位：
    １、足蹠与趾接连部，特别母趾跟部和第三趾。
    ２、足背关节部。
    ３、足侧大姆趾球和小姆趾球部。
    ４、足跟、足后跟，趾缝。
    第二、打泡的主要原因：
    １、鞋袜过大或过小：袜子过窄过小，而鞋子腹面又低。
    ２、鞋袜制造粗糙：鞋底绳疙疸太粗，绳头留得太长，折边太宽，边缘不平。
    ３、常活动在平原地带，缺乏走山路的经验。
    ４、穿新鞋或薄底鞋。
    ５、行军速度不规律，一出发就是三十里地，中间没有整理鞋袜的时间（特别在休整后第一次行军）。
    ６、着装不平衡，走路吃力。
    ７、鞋、袜、包脚布既脏又有沙泥。
    ９、行政管理教育差，到了宿营地有的洗了脚，有的不洗，没有造成行军后洗脚的习惯（雪山部三连提倡三不睡：（１）不烫脚不睡；（２）不喝开水不睡；（３）不打开被子不睡）。
    第三、预防方法种种：
    １、改进鞋袜制造：鞋内要纳平坦，尽量不要留长绳头，要加上护地布，上鞋时折边尽量不要皱纹，袜子包头要宽而适度。
    ２、部队休整时，行政上应注意调整鞋袜，尽量求得大小适宜。
    ３、新鞋练兵时穿，行军尽量穿半新半旧鞋，如穿新鞋要用锤子砸软。行军时绊好鞋带。
    ４、部队出发时，要先慢而后快，特别出发后第一次最好十五里地一休息，让大家整理鞋袜，背包等。
    ５、行军前要进行着装检查，求得走时稳当舒适。走时两手臂要甩开，迈步选目标，不要乱走和乱踩。
    ６、每天行军后要洗脚，保持足板、袜子、包脚布等干净，跑上休息时要进行倒土、倒足（休息时腿高举，按摩“用两手按摩下腿”）等运动。
    第四、治疗：
    保持足板、鞋、袜清洁，防止传染、化脓。切忌剪破，促使它顺便排液，促进很快干燥。
    一般轻的脚泡，只要很好注意烫脚，休息一夜，对于继续行军没有什么妨碍。但在继续行军时，要把有脚泡的地方用些棉花裹好它，以防继续发展。
    较重的脚泡可选用下面几种办法：
    ①涂碘酒后，用消毒针（用火烧）穿孔排液。
    ②局部涂碘酒后用消毒马尾、头发丝穿它，或涂煤油。
    ③石灰糊：生石灰和白面各一半用些水搅拦（干净的）之后敷在脚泡部。
    凡发生较重之脚泡后，即时进行治疗，用些棉花包裹好它，一、二天即可治愈。一般不会发生化脓而影响行军的。
