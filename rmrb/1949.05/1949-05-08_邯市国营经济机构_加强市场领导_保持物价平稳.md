    Handan State-Owned Economic Institutions
    Strengthen Market Leadership Maintain Price Stability

    [Report from this newspaper] Handan's state-owned economic institutions have strengthened leadership, supported cooperation, implemented commercial alignment, and maintained market stability. The city is located at the junction of southern Hebei and the Taihang Mountains, and the main necessities such as grain, cotton, salt, and cloth all rely on imports from other places. Prices often rise and fall with grain prices. Last winter, when grain prices fluctuated and rose in the southern Hebei area, the city's state-owned stores sold 2 million jin of grain to stabilize grain prices. However, due to insufficient leadership from state-owned economic institutions and inconsistent actions between public institutions' production and state-owned economic institutions, private merchants were able to speculate and hoard. Grain prices rose by as much as doubled in a short period. Consumers only purchased one-tenth of the grain sold by state-owned stores, with 80 percent being hoarded by speculative private merchants. Due to the impact of grain prices, [number missing] small producers in the city suspended operations, and citizens and workers felt panic about the grain supply. Before last month, cadres of the city's state-owned economic institutions studied the tasks of the New Democratic economy and state-owned economy. After reviewing the past market disorder and grain price fluctuations last winter, they concluded that the main reasons were the lack of planning and unified leadership by state-owned economic institutions, and the participation of public institutions' production in panic buying, which allowed private merchants to speculate. To overcome these shortcomings, a policy of strengthening state-owned economic leadership over the market, supporting cooperation, implementing commercial alignment, and stabilizing the market was determined. In the past month, the city has strengthened the organization of state-owned economic institutions. First, a unified business intelligence research conference was established between the trade, industry and commerce, and banking departments. Every five days, they study prices in the city and other places, make decisions as the basis for market leadership and management in the city, and publish economic bulletins to exchange business information with other places. Second, a city-wide administrative production management committee was established, and administrative production management measures were formulated, establishing a system for administrative production to report business to the city's Industry and Commerce Bureau. At the beginning of this month, the city also established a state-owned economic group to unify market leadership organization.

    In terms of supporting cooperation, it was decided to trial supply and marketing cooperatives in different districts before June. The first supply and marketing cooperative and employee consumer cooperative were established in March. State-owned stores allocated grain and salt at prices 10 percent lower than market prices. Currently, the cooperatives are actively studying business and expanding membership.

    Regarding commercial alignment, grain and cotton alignment is being carried out first. In the past, the city's industries were extremely chaotic, especially with one business engaging in several industries. Once market prices fluctuated, they would speculate (especially in the cotton and grain industries), affecting the soaring prices. Before alignment, the benefits of alignment for their own operations and for the market were first promoted to public and private businesses. Then, registration was carried out, and they were helped to switch industries, establish trade associations, and negotiate agreements. Grain and cotton alignment has now been completed. In the past, there were over 100 businesses engaged in the grain business, and after alignment, there are 70 businesses engaged in the grain business. Before cotton alignment, there were over 30 businesses, and now there are 17 businesses engaged in the cotton business. The rest have switched to other industries. After the above work, market chaos has gradually been overcome. In late March, grain prices fluctuated again in the southeast region, and grain began to flow in reverse. After hearing the news, the business intelligence research conference immediately conducted research, determined that administrative production should stop purchasing grain, state-owned stores should sell grain, and mobilized grain businesses through the grain industry association to stabilize the market, and appropriately managed foreign grain merchants. As a result, in late March, millet in the city steadily rose from 12 yuan to 16 yuan, red sorghum rose from 8 yuan to 12 yuan, and cotton rose from 80 yuan to 117 yuan due to purchases by state-owned stores. At the beginning of last month, grain prices in the city fell back, with millet falling to 14 yuan and red sorghum falling to 10 yuan, maintaining market stability. However, when cotton prices rose, the Gongying Tongren Cooperative and Jianhua Company took the opportunity to purchase cotton through private merchants. The administrative production management committee is now handling this in accordance with regulations. Currently, the market problems in the city are: the unified leadership organization of state-owned and public enterprises has only just been established, and there is still a lack of concrete methods for how to specifically strengthen leadership and support cooperation. The publicity and explanation of commercial alignment are still insufficient, and some warehouses are afraid to boldly operate because they do not understand their own industry. Greater efforts are still needed to promote the work of alignment.

    邯市国营经济机构
    加强市场领导  保持物价平稳
    【本报讯】邯郸市国营经济机构，加强领导，扶植合作，施行商业归行，保持了市场平稳。该市位于冀南、太行接合地带，粮、棉、盐、布等主要必须品，均靠外地输入，物价多以粮价升降而升降；去冬冀南地区粮价波动上涨时，该市国营商店曾售出粮食达二百万斤平抑粮价，但由于国营经济机构的领导不够，公营机关生产与国营经济机构行动不一，便利了私商投机倒把囤积行为，粮价于短期内曾跳跃上升一倍，消费者仅购到国营商店出售粮食的十分之一，百分之八十为投机私商倒把囤积，全市小生产者受粮价影响歇业者××家，市民、工人均感到粮食恐慌。该市国营经济机构干部，于上月前学习了新民主主义经济与国营经济的任务后，对过去市场紊乱及去冬粮价波动作了检讨，认为其主要原因是国营经济机构没有计划及统一领导，公营机关生产参加抢购，使私商得到投机所致。为克服以上缺点，遂即确定了加强国营经济对市场领导，扶植合作、施行商业归行，平稳市场的方针。一月来，该市在加强国营经济机构组织方面，首先建立了贸易、工商、银行部门的统一商情研究会议，每五天研究一次本市与外地的物价，作出本市市场领导管理的依据，出印经济通报与外地交换商情；其次又建立了全市机关生产管理委员会，制订了机关生产管理办法，确定了机关生产向市工商局业务汇报制度。本月初该市又建立了国营经济小组，统一了市场领导组织。
    扶植合作方面，决定在六月以前分区试办供销社，三月已建立了第一供销社和职工消费合作社，国营商店以低于市价百分之十价格配给了粮食与食盐各一部，目前合作社正学习业务积极扩展社员工作。
    商业归行工作，目前首先进行了粮棉的归行工作，该市过去各业极其混乱，尤其一家经营数业，一旦市场物价波动即进行投机，（尤其棉粮业）影响物价跳跃上涨。归行前，首先对公私商业宣传了归行对自己经营对市场的好处，继之进行登记，帮其转业建立行会，议订公约。现粮、棉业归行已经完毕，过去经营粮业百余家，归行后，经营粮业者七十家；棉业归行前三十余家，现经营者十七家。其余都转营了其他行业。经过以上工作后，市场混乱逐渐克服，三月下旬东南地区粮价又有波动，粮食形成倒流，商情研究会闻讯后，当即做了研究，确定机关生产停止购粮，国营商店抛售粮食，通过粮业行会进行了动员粮行平稳市场，对外来粮商做了适当管理。结果下旬该市小米由十二元稳升至十六元，红粮由八元升至十二元，棉花由于国营商店收购，由八十元涨至一一七元，上月初该市粮价回跌，小米跌至十四元，红粮跌至十元，保持了市场的平稳。但在棉价上涨时，仍有公营同仁合作社，建华公司趁机通过私商购棉，现机关生产管理委员会正在按章处理。目前该市市场问题是：国营、公营统一领导组织才建立，怎样去具体加强领导，扶植合作，尚欠具体办法，商业归行宣传解释的还不够，有些货栈因不明自己行业，不敢大胆经营，尚需大力进行归行工作的宣传。
