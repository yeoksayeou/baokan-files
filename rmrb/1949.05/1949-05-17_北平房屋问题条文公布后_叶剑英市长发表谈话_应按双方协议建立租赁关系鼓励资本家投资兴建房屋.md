　　After the Promulgation of Regulations on Housing Issues in Beiping
  　Mayor Ye Jianying Gives a Talk
    Rental Relationships Should Be Established According to Mutual Agreements, and Capitalists Should Be Encouraged to Invest in Building Houses
    [Reported by This Newspaper] Following the promulgation of regulations on housing issues in Beiping, people from all walks of life in the city believe that a problem they have long hoped for has been reasonably resolved. They mostly express their agreement with the People's Government's regulations with a joyful feeling. At the same time, they raised some related questions, hoping that the People's Government would have clear regulations. This reporter specially visited Mayor Ye Jianying yesterday (16th), and Mayor Ye gave the following talk: Regarding the reasonable resolution of the housing problem in Beiping, this is an important issue for the lives of the two million people in the city. The articles of the housing policy we have promulgated have been carefully studied by people from all sides. In the current situation, we believe that urban housing should be reasonably protected. This will not only promote the prosperity of the new Beiping's construction but also establish normal rental relationships for houses. From the date of the announcement, all the people of this city should abide by the rents agreed upon by both parties. Tenants and landlords should respect each other and face this problem squarely. Although we have not specified concrete figures in terms of housing prices, in my opinion, it is better to let landlords and tenants negotiate on their own. At the same time, the government has already set reasonable restrictions in principle in the announcement. After both parties have reached a reasonable agreement, they should also report or register with the government. In addition, regarding the issue of sub-landlords, it has become a common practice in major cities across the country. What we want to oppose now is their excessive exploitation. As for some capitalists who are willing to invest in building houses for rent, we still encourage and agree with this. Finally, Mayor Ye said that after any law is promulgated, it must be revised at any time during its implementation. We also need all parties to provide more opinions to achieve a more perfect handling of this issue.

　　北平房屋问题条文公布后
  　叶剑英市长发表谈话
    应按双方协议建立租赁关系鼓励资本家投资兴建房屋
    【本报讯】关于北平房屋问题公布后，平市各界均认为他们盼望多时的问题，已获得合理的解决。大都用一种愉快的心情，表示同意人民政府此项规定。同时也提出一些有关问题，希望人民政府有明确的规定。记者于昨（十六）日特访叶剑英市长，承叶市长发表谈话如次：关于合理解决北平房屋问题，这是平市二百万人民生活上一个重要问题。我们公布的关于房屋政策的条文是经过各方人士慎重的研讨的，在目前情况下，对于城市房屋我们认为是应该合理保护的，这样不仅可以繁荣新北平的建设，更可建立起房屋租赁的正常关系。从布告发布之日起，所有本市人民应一律按照双方议定租赁，房客与房主应互相遵守，正视这个问题。在房价方面虽然我们没有具体数目字的规定，据我的意见，让房主房客自行协议，是比较好的，同时政府在布告中也已经有了原则上合理的限制。在双方合理协议后，还应该到政府去报告或登记。此外关于二房东问题，在全国各大城市中已经形成了一个惯例，我们目前要反对的是他们过度的剥削。至于对于有些资本家愿意投资兴建出赁房屋，我们仍是鼓励赞同的。最后叶市长说，任何法律公布后，都要在实施中随时加以修正的，我们还需要各方多提供意见，以能达到更完善的处理这个问题。  　（柏生）
