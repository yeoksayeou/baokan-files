　　Jiaozuo Trading Company
  　Appropriately Sells Grain, Crushing Speculation and Manipulation
    [Our Dispatch] Jiaozuo is a well-known coal mining industrial area, but it lacks grain. The mine and railway bureau have a total of 4,847 workers (not counting family members of staff), all of whom rely on their monthly wages to purchase the necessary grain. Therefore, in the past, whenever workers were paid, the market price of grain would rise, and private merchants and grain shops would take the opportunity to carry out intermediate exploitation. This month, when wages were paid on the 16th, private merchants still attempted to speculate, and on the 18th, most of them stopped selling, raising the price of grain. In order to guarantee the supply of living materials for workers and eliminate intermediate exploitation by private merchants, the local trading company's grain store sold grain to workers and citizens at the stable period grain price. From the 17th to the 21st, a total of 56,425 jin of grain was sold, finally stabilizing the market order. During the large-scale sale, wheat was only fifteen or sixteen yuan per jin, which led the market without fluctuating the market price of grain.
    The 21st of this month was again the payday for the miners. The company's grain store continued to sell 20,181 jin of wheat at fifteen or sixteen yuan per jin on the 22nd and 23rd, supplying direct producers and enabling them to obtain benefits from state-owned enterprises. (Mai Zi)

　　焦作贸易公司
  　适时抛售粮食粉碎投机操纵
    【本报讯】焦作是有名的煤矿工业区，但缺乏粮食，矿厂及铁路局共四八四七名工人，（职员家属未计）都要靠每月工资来购买所需粮食。所以过去每逢工人发工资，市场粮价就要上涨，私商粮行就乘机进行中间剥削。本月十六发薪时私商仍然企图投机，于十八日大部停止出售，抬高粮价。该地贸易公司粮店为保障工人生活资料之供给，免除私商中间剥削，按照稳定时期粮食牌价售给工人市民。于十七日开始至二十一日共售出粮五万六千四百二十五斤，终于稳定了市场秩序。在大量抛售中小麦每斤只十五、十六元，使市场粮价未受到波动起了领导市场的作用。
    本月二十一日又是采矿工人的发薪时期，该公司粮店于二十二、三、两日仍以小麦每斤十五、十六元继续出售二万○一百八十一斤，供给直接生产者，使他们从国营企业机关得到实惠。（麦子）
