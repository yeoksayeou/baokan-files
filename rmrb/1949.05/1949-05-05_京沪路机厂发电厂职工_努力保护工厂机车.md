Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th: Thanks to the efforts of workers and staff, the People's Liberation Army was able to completely take over the Qishuyan Railway Machinery Plant and Power Plant on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, as well as railway locomotives and equipment in Changzhou, Qishuyan, and other locations. Before Qishuyan was liberated, the workers and staff of the local railway machinery plant and power plant secretly organized to protect the factory. During the fighting, the workers on duty at the machinery plant continued to work as usual. The remaining workers and staff living in the factory, along with their families, totaling over ten thousand people, gathered in the factory to monitor Kuomintang secret agents and saboteurs, preventing them from damaging the machinery. At the same time, they warned them not to resist the People's Liberation Army. The power plant workers persisted in their work and continued to generate electricity as usual. As soon as the battle ended, both factories were handed over to the People's Liberation Army by the workers and staff. When the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated, they forced the Changzhou Locomotive Depot of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to send locomotives to the western section to destroy the No. 1903 large iron bridge, but this was refused by the depot chief. At the same time, the supervisor secretly slipped away. The bandit troops then attempted to drive two locomotives east to carry out destruction, but this was discovered by worker Cheng A'ming, who shouted, "The People's Liberation Army is coming from the west!" "The Qishuyan train is coming from the east!" This scared away the bandit troops. The workers and staff carefully inspected all locomotives and important engine rooms to prevent accidents. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, the workers reported the good condition of the locomotives and handed over all the weapons and ammunition left behind by the bandit troops. The workers of the Changzhou Locomotive Depot also automatically organized day and night shifts to guard and protect the locomotives and equipment.

    努力保护工厂机车
    【新华社南京四日电】京沪路戚墅堰铁路机厂和发电厂及常州、戚墅堰等地的铁路机车、器材，由于工人职员的努力保护，人民解放军得以完整地接收。戚墅堰解放前，当地铁路机厂和发电厂的工人、职员即秘密组织起来保护工厂。在战斗进行中，机厂值班工人照常工作，其余住厂工人、职员以及他们的家属共一万数千人集合在厂里，监视国民党特务破坏分子，使其不能破坏机器，同时并警告他们不得抵抗解放军。电厂工人则坚持工作，照常发电。战斗甫告结束，两厂更由工人职员交给解放军接管。国民党匪军在撤退时，曾迫使京沪路常州机务段派机车至西段破坏一九零三号大铁桥，但遭到该段段长的拒绝，同时监工员也偷偷地溜走了，匪军当时又图向东开出两台机车进行破坏，被工人程阿鸣发觉，他便大叫：“西边解放军过来了！”“东边戚墅堰车子开来了！”这样吓跑了匪军。职工们并到各个机车和重要机房仔细巡察，以防意外。当解放军到达时，工人们便向其报告机车完好情形，并将匪军遗留的武器弹药一一点交。常州机务段工人也自动组织日夜班轮流看守，保护了机车器材。
