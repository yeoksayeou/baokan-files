    The labor and Life of Soviet Workers
    The October Revolution turned the workers and peasants of the old Russian Empire upside down, transforming them from slaves of landlords and capitalists into the true masters of the Soviet state.

    After the October Revolution, the Soviet people's attitude towards labor also fundamentally changed. "In the past, labor was a painful and shameful thing, but now, it has become a glorious, brave, and heroic undertaking" (Stalin).

    The rise in the social status of the working people and the development of a communist attitude towards labor have sparked the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of the Soviet people, giving rise to and unfolding various production movements.

    More than 90 percent of the workers, engineers, technicians, and staff throughout the Soviet Union have now joined the socialist competition.

    The movement to conclude collective contracts arose in an environment of high political and production activism among the masses. This movement reached such a height in 1947 that 25,000 collective contracts were concluded in the three basic sectors of the Soviet national economy (industry, transportation, and construction), covering 14 million people. This number exceeds half of the total number of members of Soviet trade unions in 1946 (27 million).

    The Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan was completed in four years, and the Soviet people are striving to maintain this glorious historical record as they carry out the new post-war Five-Year Plan. Moreover, more than 2,000 enterprises had already completed the new Five-Year Plan in the third year (1948).

    As a result of the heroic labor of the Soviet people, the Soviet Union has been built into a strong country, and their living standards have gradually improved.

    The improvement in Soviet living standards can be measured by the increase in the wage fund for workers and staff. In 1928, the year the New Economic Policy ended and the First Five-Year Plan began, the wage fund for workers and staff totaled 8.1 billion rubles. By the year before the Soviet-German War (1940), the wage fund had increased to 162 billion rubles. According to the budget, by the last year of the post-war Five-Year Plan (1950), this fund will increase to 252.3 billion rubles.

    In accordance with the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" stipulated in the Soviet Constitution, the sex, age, race, and nationality of workers and staff shall not be used as reasons to violate the general plan for work remuneration. Wage differences are determined solely by the level of skill and difficulty of the work. Thus, the continuous increase in wages reflects the continuous improvement in labor productivity.

    The Soviet working people have made great contributions to their motherland, and the Soviet Party and government have also shown great concern for their working people.

    "People are the most valuable and decisive capital" (Stalin). Therefore, the Soviet Union considers labor protection to be a matter of utmost importance. Great achievements have been made in preventing serious injuries and improving working conditions in the Soviet Union. State expenditures on labor protection are increasing year by year. The labor protection fees for the most recent five years are:

    1944  370 million rubles
    1945  560 million rubles
    1946  650 million rubles
    1947  850 million rubles
    1948  1.074 billion rubles

    The Soviet Union is the only country in the world that fully implements social insurance for workers and staff. The increase in Soviet social insurance premiums is as follows (excluding medical expenses):

    First Five-Year Plan  4.7 billion rubles
    Second Five-Year Plan  17.9 billion rubles
    Post-war Five-Year Plan  61.6 billion rubles (budget)

    "Workers in various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union, in addition to ordinary wages, can also receive insurance allowances, living improvement fees, and cultural fees, which amount to about one-third of their wages" (Stalin).

    Trade unions have played a significant role in the communist education of the Soviet working people. Zhdanov instructed at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "In the work of educating its members, trade unions should achieve such a result that the level of members is raised to the level of understanding the tasks of the communist vanguard, that is, raised to the level of Party spirit." Through the education of trade unions in the "Communist School," the Soviet working people have become the vanguard of the world's working class.

    苏联工人的劳动和生活
    十月革命使旧俄帝国的工人和农民翻了一个身，他们从地主、资本家的奴隶变成了苏维埃国家的真正主人。
    十月革命以后，苏联人民对于劳动的态度也根本改变了。“在从前，劳动是一种痛苦的和可耻的事情，在现在，已经成为一种光荣的、勇敢的和英雄的事业”（斯大林）。
    劳动人民的社会地位的提高和共产主义的劳动态度的养成，掀起了苏联广大人民的劳动热忱，产生了并展开了各种生产运动。
    在苏联全国的工人、工程师、技师和职员中，现在已经有百分之九十以上的人参加了社会主义竞赛。
    订立集体合同这种运动是在群众的高度的政治积极性和生产积极性的环境下产生的。这种运动，在一九四七年里达到了这样的高度：在苏联国民经济的三个基本部门（工业、运输、建筑）里，曾经订立了二万五千个集体合同，包括了一千四百万人。这项人数和一九四六年的苏联职工会会员总数（二千七百万人）相比，超过了一半。
    苏联的第一次五年计划是在四年里完成的，苏联人民在进行战后新五年计划的时候，正在努力保持着这项光荣的历史纪录。而且有二千种以上的企业早已在第三年（一九四八年）里完成了新的五年计划。
    苏联人民的英勇劳动的结果，一方面把苏联造成了一个强盛的国家，另一方面逐渐提高了自己的生活水准。
    苏联生活水准的提高可以用工人职员的工资基金的增加来衡量的。一九二八年，也就是新经济政策结束和第一次五年计划开始的一年，工人职员的工资基金共计八十一亿卢布。到苏德战争的前一年（一九四○年），工资基金已经增加到一千六百二十亿卢布。按照预算，到战后五年计划的最后一年（一九五○年），这项基金将增加到二千五百二十三亿卢布。
    按照苏联宪法规定的“各尽所能，按劳取值”的社会主义原则，工人职员的性别、年龄、种族和国籍都不能作为理由来违背关于工作报酬的一般规划。工资上的差别仅仅是根据工作的熟练程度和难易程度来决定的。这样，工资的不断增加正是反映着劳动生产力的不断提高。
    苏联劳动人民对自己的祖国作了伟大的贡献，苏联的党和政府对自己的劳动人民也表现了伟大的关心。
    “人是一种最宝贵的和最起决定作用的资本”（斯大林）。所以苏联对于劳动保护，认为是一件至高无上的重要事情。防止重伤和改善劳动条件，在苏联已经获得很大的成就。国家对于劳动保护的支出在逐年地增加着。最近五年间的劳动保护费是：
    一九四四年  三亿七千万卢布
    一九四五年  五亿六千万卢布
    一九四六年  六亿五千万卢布
    一九四七年  八亿五千万卢布
    一九四八年  十亿七千四百万卢布
    苏联是世界上唯一的，充份实现了工人职员的社会保险的国家。苏联社会保险费的增加情形如下（医药用费除外）：
    第一次五年计划  四十七亿卢布
    第二次五年计划  一百七十九亿卢布
    战后五年计划  六百十六亿卢布（预算）
    “苏联各工业部门的工人，除了普通工资，还能获得保险津贴、生活改善费和文化费等约合工资三分之一的收入”（斯大林）。
    职工会对于苏联劳动人民的共产主义教育起了极大的作用。日丹诺夫在联共（布）十八次代表大会上指示说：“职工会在教育自己会员的工作方面应当得到这样的结果：把会员的水准提高到能够理解共产主义先锋队的任务的水准，也就是提高到党性的水准”。苏联劳动人民通过“共产主义学校”的职工会的教育，成了世界工人阶级的先锋。
