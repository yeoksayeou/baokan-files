　　Strictly Prohibit Smugglers from Illicitly Trafficking Silver Dollars
To the Esteemed Editor:
    Our county is located in the northeastern corner of the Southern Hebei District, with the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Railway traversing its territory. In recent months, we have uncovered several cases of silver smuggling, with each person carrying between three and five hundred silver dollars. Through education and interrogation, they all confessed that the current black market price of silver in Shijiazhuang is around 37,000 to 38,000 Jiao currency per silver dollar. In Dezhou, in the Bohai District, one silver dollar can earn 4,000 to 5,000 Jiao currency. If one trip involves carrying 500 silver dollars, it is possible to earn over 2 million Jiao currency. Furthermore, they all bring cigarettes along, which have very high profit margins. Therefore, these smugglers are relentlessly riding their bicycles day and night to traffic silver. Although the militia along the way have seized some, many are still slipping through. The leadership should urgently take strict measures to stop this, otherwise there will likely be even more people smuggling silver.

　　严禁奸商私贩银元编辑同志：
    我县位于冀南区东北隅，石德铁路横贯县境，数月以来查获白银奸商数起，每人携带三、五百元不等，经教育审讯，均各供认目前石门黑市白银每圆值冀钞三万七、八千元上下，到渤海区德县，白银一元能赚冀钞四、五千元；如一趟带白银五百元，可能赚冀钞二百多万元。再他们一去都带纸烟，利润很高，因此奸商们昼夜不停的骑着车子贩卖白银，虽经沿途民兵查获一部，漏掉的仍甚多，领导上急应严加制止，否则贩卖白银者可能更多。
