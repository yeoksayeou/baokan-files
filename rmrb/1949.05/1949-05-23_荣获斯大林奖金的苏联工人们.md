Soviet Workers Awarded Stalin Prizes

　　Semyon Maksimenko was born in 1907. At the age of sixteen, he began working as a bricklayer. He became famous for developing and applying the conveyor system in bricklaying. In November 1937, he set a new all-Union record for high-speed bricklaying in Moscow. During World War II, he worked in Siberia, participating in the large-scale construction in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. He is now a student at the Novosibirsk City Institute of Architecture. In June 1946, he was awarded the Stalin Prize for rationalizing and introducing high-speed construction methods.

    Yegor Agarkov was born into a peasant family in 1912. In 1930, he participated in the construction of a large tractor factory in Kharkov. After the factory was established, he decided to work in industry and chose the profession of welder. He was a very capable worker, quickly mastered his new profession, and introduced various new methods for improving work. Engineers were very interested in his inventions, and Kharkov published a book describing his welding methods. During the war, he served as the captain of a welding team in a factory in the Ural region. To improve the technology and organization of the work process, he suggested merging two teams, reducing the total number of workers in the merged team, while maintaining the original production level. This plan worked. His creativity received a widespread response throughout the country. In January 1946, he was awarded the Stalin Prize. He is now studying at the Chelyabinsk Technical College. At the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in March 1946, he was elected as a people's assessor of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union.

    Yekaterina Balyshnikova was born into a peasant family in the Moscow region in 1922. She later moved to Moscow and worked at the Kaganovich Ball Bearing Factory. During the Soviet-German War, factories felt a great shortage of workers. At this time, she provided several improvements to the work, organizing her team so that each person could manage two lathes instead of just one, without reducing the quality of the products. 20,000 teams across the country followed her example, resulting in 70,000 workers being transferred to other work departments. According to the decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union on January 26, 1946, she and seven other team leaders from the factory were awarded the Stalin Prize.

    Luka Golokholosov is an old miner in the Donbas coal region and has worked at the "Ungrovka" mine No. 28 for more than 20 years. He is a very creative person. Previously, the mine employed six or seven miners to sink a well. He later took on this work alone. After carefully studying the characteristics of the vein, he adopted the most effective well-digging method, reducing the time by one-third or one-quarter, and in 1944, he completed five times his quota. He was awarded the Stalin Prize for introducing new and advanced organization methods of labor in mining work.

　　荣获斯大林奖金的苏联工人们
    谢明·马克西明科生于一九○七年。十六岁时，开始当泥瓦匠。他是靠在砌砖工作上展开和应用传送制而声名大噪的。他于一九三七年十一月在莫斯科创立了全苏联高速度砌砖工作中的新记录。第二次世界大战期间，他在西伯利亚工作，参加了苏联东部地区的大建设。现在，他是新西伯利亚城建筑学院的学生。一九四六年六月，因合理化及引用高速度建筑方法而荣获斯大林奖金。

    耶果尔·阿加尔柯夫　于一九一二年生于一个农民家庭里。一九三○年，在哈尔科夫参加了建立一个大拖拉机工厂的工作。在该工厂建立后，他决定在工业界工作，选择了电焊工人这一行业。他是一个很能干的工人，很快便掌握了他的新行业，并介绍了种种改进工作方法的新方法。工程师们对他的发明很感兴趣，哈尔科夫便出版了一本叙述他的电焊方法的书籍。战争期间，他担任乌拉尔区一个工厂的电焊工人队队长。他为了改进工作过程中的技术和组织，建议把两队人合并起来，减少合并后的新队中的工人总数，仍维持原来的生产水平。这个计划行通了。他的创造性受到了全国的普遍响应。一九四六年一月，荣获了斯大林奖金。他现在在车里雅宾斯克技术学院学习。在苏联最高苏维埃一九四六年三月的会议上，他当选为苏联最高法院的人民陪审理事。

    耶卡特利娜·巴利什尼科娃　于一九二二年生于莫斯科州一个农民家庭里。她后来迁居到莫斯科，在卡冈诺维奇球轴承工厂工作。苏德战争时期，各工厂都甚感工人缺乏。她这时候对工作提供了若干改进，把她那一队的工作组织得每一个人都可以照管车床两台而不仅是一台，产品的质量则不减低。全国各地两万个工作队效法了她的例子，致使七万名工人转入了他种工作部门。根据苏联人民委员会议一九四六年一月二十六日的决定，她及其他工厂的七个工作队队长荣获了斯大林奖金。

    路卡·哥洛科罗索夫　是顿巴斯煤区的老矿工，在第二十八号矿厂“温格罗夫卡”厂工作了二十年以上。他是极富于创造性的人。该矿厂从前是雇用六七个矿工掘井的。他后来独自担当了这一工作，在仔细研究了矿脉的特性后，采用了最有效的挖井方法，使时间减少了三分之一或四分之一，而在一九四四年，做出了超过其定额五倍的工作。他因引用了采矿工作中劳动力的新而先进的组织方法，荣获了斯大林奖金。
