    Seeing Intellectuals from the "May Fourth" Perspective
    Song Yunbin
    Intellectuals played a leading role in both the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement. The Xinhai Revolution failed. There were many reasons for the failure, one of which was that the intellectuals who played a leading role did not have a sufficient understanding of the revolution and could not integrate with the workers and peasants. The May Fourth Movement was initiated by young students, and then industrial workers in large cities participated. Intellectuals and workers began to unite. The workers' movement gradually developed, and workers organized groups to participate in various political and economic struggles. After this political struggle, intellectuals' thinking changed drastically, they recognized the new direction of the Chinese revolution, and realized that only workers and peasants were reliable allies. From then on, the proletariat played a leading role in the Chinese revolutionary movement, and intellectuals fulfilled their task of being pioneers and bridges in the united front. From then on, the Chinese revolution gradually moved towards success.
    However, intellectuals have their inherent weaknesses. When they have not been able to integrate with the workers and peasants, have not been able to become one with the revolutionary struggles of the workers and peasants, have not been able to resolve to serve the people, and have not been able to popularize their lives, their thoughts are often empty and their actions are often wavering. Intellectuals also tend to have a subjective, individualistic arrogance. If they cannot overcome this, they will become detached from the masses at critical moments of the revolution and adopt a passive attitude of acting alone. They may even feel that the end of the day is far away and simply turn back, approaching imperialism and the big bourgeoisie, and serving them to oppose the masses. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. We see that in these 30 long years, haven't some intellectuals, who appeared as warriors of the New Culture Movement in their early years, gradually regressed, fallen behind, or even become reactionary?
    However, those who regressed and fell behind are ultimately a minority, and those who became reactionary are an even smaller minority. Moreover, although the older generation and a minority regressed, fell behind, or even became reactionary, the majority of progressive young intellectuals have caught up. Therefore, the Chinese revolution has always been moving forward, and has not been hindered by the regression, backwardness, or reaction of a few intellectuals.
    "The organization of revolutionary forces and the construction of revolutionary undertakings cannot be successful without the participation of revolutionary intellectuals." The May Fourth Movement was initiated and led by revolutionary intellectuals. Now, as we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the older generation of intellectuals should reflect on themselves and ask whether their thoughts and lives are still worthy of being called "revolutionary intellectuals." The younger generation should also examine themselves to see if they still retain some of the common weaknesses of intellectuals that they have not been able to overcome? Because we bear a great responsibility in the construction of the revolutionary cause!

    从“五四”看知识分子
    宋云彬
    知识分子在辛亥革命和五四运动中都起了领导作用。辛亥革命是失败的，失败的原因很多，起领导作用的知识分子对革命认识不够，不能和工农大众结合起来也是原因之一。五四运动由青年学生发动，接着大都市的产业工人都参加了，知识分子和工人大众就开始结合起来。工人运动渐渐开展，工人们纷纷组织团体，参加政治的、经济的各种斗争，而知识分子经过这一次政治斗争，思想亟变，认识中国革命的新方向，知道只有工农大众才是可靠的同盟者。从此以后，无产阶级在中国革命运动中起领导作用，而知识分子则在联合战线中尽它的做先锋与做桥梁的任务。从此以后，中国的革命渐渐走上成功的道路。
    但是，知识分子有它的先天的弱点，当它没有能够与工农大众结合起来，没有能够与工农大众的革命斗争打成一片，没有能够下决心为人民服务，没有能够把自己的生活群众化的时候，思想往往是空虚的，行动往往是动摇的。知识分子又往往有一种主观的个人主义的自大性，如果不能加以克服，到了革命的紧要关头，他们会脱离群众，而采取一种独往独来的消极态度。甚至于感到日暮途远，索性走回头路，去接近帝国主义与大资产阶级，并为他们服务而反对群众了。五四运动到今年三十周年。我们看，在这三十年漫长的岁月中，不是有一些知识分子，当年以新文化运动的战士姿态出现，后来慢慢地退婴、落伍、甚至于反动了吗？
    不过退婴、落伍的究竟还是少数人，至于反动的更加是少数中的少数了。而且前一辈的、少数的虽然退婴、落伍或者甚至于反动了，但多数的进步青年知识分子又赶上前面来了。所以中国的革命始终在向前进，没有因了少数知识分子的退婴、落伍或反动而受到阻碍。
    “革命力量的组织与革命事业的建设，离开革命的知识分子的参加是不能成功的。”五四运动是革命的知识分子所发动，并且起领导作用的。现在纪念五四三十周年，年长一辈的知识分子应该好好儿自省一番，自己的思想和生活还配得上称作“革命的知识分子”吗？年青一辈的，也应该自己检讨一下，是不是还留有一些知识分子所常有的弱点而没有能力克服？因为我们在革命事业的建设上是负着重大的责任的呀！
