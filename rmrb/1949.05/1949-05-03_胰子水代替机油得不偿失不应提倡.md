    Using Soap Water Instead of Machine Oil is Counterproductive and Should Not Be Promoted
    To the Editor:
    In the article "The First Machinery Factory in Ping City Rushes to Meet Production Targets" on page two of the April 23rd edition, it was mentioned that the factory's Mechanical Engineering Department issued an opinion proposing the use of soap water instead of machine oil to save materials. While the intention of the comrades in this department to save materials is commendable, using soap water instead of machine oil is actually harmful because: (1) Soap water has a low lubrication rate, which can easily cause machine wear. (2) Soap water has a corrosive effect on metal, damaging machine parts. (3) It makes machines prone to rusting. Saving a little machine oil at the expense of damaging the machines is counterproductive. Therefore, please inform the comrades at the First Machinery Factory to re-examine this issue carefully and find more reasonable ways to save materials.

    胰子水代替机油得不偿失不应提倡
    编辑同志：
    四月二十三日二版“平市第一机器厂加工赶活闹生产”一稿中，说该厂机工部发表意见书，提出用胰子水代替机油，以节省材料。该部同志们这种节省材料的用意是好，但胰子水代替机油却是有害的。因为：（一）胰子水滑润率小，容易磨损机器。（二）胰子水对金属有浸蚀性，损坏机件。（三）使机器容易生锈。省一点机油而损害了机器，这是得不偿失的，因此请转告第一机器厂同志们，再仔细研究一下，要从合理的地方去节省材料。          一读者
