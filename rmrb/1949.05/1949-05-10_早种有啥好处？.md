[Jinan News] This time, in response to the call for drought-resistant planting, some farmers in Dong'er Ren Village, Linqing, believed that the seedlings in the black soil grow faster and always planted late, unwilling to plant early. The village branch members used the example of Wang Erxiao's early planting of sorghum last year, which resulted in a larger harvest, to illustrate the benefits of early planting: (1) The flowers can be exposed to the heat of midsummer when they bloom, resulting in more flour and better taste. (2) Early maturity and early harvest allow the land to rest. (3) If it doesn't rain, the soil can still retain moisture (farmers call it having "qiang"), and seeing seedlings means a 30% harvest. (4) Early planting prevents mole crickets from damaging the crops. Then, they organized the farmers to discuss the matter, and everyone realized that this year there is little rain and little moisture in the soil, making late planting unreliable, so they began to rush to plant while the soil still had moisture.

    早种有啥好处？
    【冀南讯】这次号召防旱播种，临清东二任庄部分农民认为黑土地苗长的快，一向晚种，不愿早下种。该村支部党员便以王二小去年种高梁早种多收为例，说明早种的好处：（一）扬花时能晒到伏里，多出面又好吃。（二）早熟早收，能歇地。（三）不下雨能凑垧（土中有水分农民叫有垧），见苗三分收。（四）早种蝼蛄拱不了。然后组织农民讨论，大家才认识到今年雨少垧小晚种不保险，开始了抢垧播种。
