The Cultural Management Committee Announces the Regulations on People's Scholarships for Students in National Colleges and Universities in Beiping
    [This Newspaper] At the beginning of the liberation of Beiping, most students in Beiping's national universities faced temporary interruption of their economic resources because their families were in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, or because their families had financial difficulties during the siege, making it temporarily impossible to provide for their tuition and living expenses. To address this, the Cultural Management Committee generally provided public funds to students. However, this approach was only suitable for temporary needs. Now that various parts of the country are being liberated successively, and postal remittances are gradually becoming accessible, the Cultural Management Committee, in order to reduce the burden on the people and ensure that the allocation of public funds is fair and reasonable, drafted a plan last month and sent it to student unions of various schools for discussion. This has now been completed. The Cultural Management Committee, with reference to the discussion results of various schools, has changed the name of public funds to "People's Scholarships" and announced the Provisional Regulations on People's Scholarships for Students, which are issued to various schools for implementation. The regulations are as follows:
    (1) Conditions for applying for People's Scholarships: 1. The family's living conditions must be truly difficult, unable to be self-sufficient or unable to be fully self-sufficient, or the family's location is not yet accessible for remittances, resulting in interruption of economic resources. 2. Academic performance must be excellent, and the applicant must be willing to serve the people.
    (2) Standards for the supply of People's Scholarships: According to the above conditions and depending on the circumstances, they are divided into: Grade A People's Scholarship: 85 catties of millet per month. Grade B People's Scholarship: 65 catties of millet per month. Grade C People's Scholarship: 45 catties of millet per month. Grade D People's Scholarship for Graduate Students: A stipend of 200 catties of millet per month.
    Note: Students' medical expenses will be handled separately from the regular expenses of each school.
    (3) Procedures for applying for People's Scholarships: 1. Students should fill out the application form in accordance with the prescribed format, reporting their specific personal circumstances to the student evaluation小组 at the department level for preliminary verification, and submit it to the "People's Scholarship Evaluation Committee" organized by each school for review. The "People's Scholarship Evaluation Committee" shall be composed of one dean of academic affairs, three professor representatives recommended by the school affairs committee, and three representatives recommended by the student self-government association. The Dean of Academic Affairs shall be the chairman. 2. After the evaluation committee of each school has reviewed the applications, it shall report the qualified applicants to the higher education administrative authority for approval in accordance with the prescribed format, and at the same time notify the student union of each school to report to the affiliated student federation.
    (4) Methods for evaluating People's Scholarships: In order to solve the difficulties of aspiring young people in pursuing their studies, and under the principle of not wasting the people's wealth, we strive to be fair and reasonable, and put forward the following methods for reference during the evaluation. 1. The student evaluation 小组 at the department level organized by the student union of each school shall handle student application matters. 2. The People's Scholarship is to take care of students who are truly in financial difficulty and have excellent academic performance and are willing to serve the people, so that they can continue their studies. Therefore, every student should consciously save the people's wealth and not regard obtaining a scholarship as an earned right. The evaluation committee should also adhere to this principle to make a fair and reasonable evaluation. 3. After receiving the student's application, the evaluation committee should immediately conduct investigations and research, and launch discussions among the masses of the department to which the student belongs. 4. The evaluation committee should make a fair evaluation based on the opinions of the masses and the collected materials. 5. The evaluation committee may, based on the situation, report the increase or decrease, or even cancellation, of the scholarship of the students whose scholarships have been approved at any time.
    (5) Procedures for the issuance of People's Scholarships: 1. After the higher education administrative authority receives the list of qualified People's Scholarship students from each school, it will notify each school of the situation after verification. 2. The higher education administrative authority shall issue People's Scholarships to each school based on the verified quantity. 3. After receiving the People's Scholarships, each school shall forward them to the students for collection, and prepare a list of qualified People's Scholarship calculations. Submit the calculation table to the higher education administrative authority for review. 4. Each school shall submit a statement of settlement of the People's Scholarships received before the 3rd of the second month.
    (6) From the date of promulgation of these regulations, the previous public funding method shall be abolished.
