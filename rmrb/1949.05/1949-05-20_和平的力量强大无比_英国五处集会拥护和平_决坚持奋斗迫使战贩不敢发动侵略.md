The main speakers at the meeting were representatives attending the Paris Peace Conference: French atomic scientist Professor Joliot-Curie, British Member of Parliament Zilliacus, Archbishop of Canterbury Johnson, and American black singer and democratic fighter Robeson.

The resolution stated: "The British people refuse to turn Britain into a base for aggression. We will do our part and fight together with all good men and women to force the warmongers not to dare to launch a war. We declare our support for the decisions of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and will do everything possible to implement the principles of the Congress declaration." The resolution concluded by quoting the conclusion of the declaration of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace: "We are prepared and determined to fight for the victory of the struggle for peace and survival."
