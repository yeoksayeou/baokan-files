    Roosevelt Road Office Launches Credit Overdrafts
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beima Road Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Bank has made great progress in its deposit business. Currently, there are more than 730 current accounts, and the total deposit amount in April exceeded 2.8 times that of March. The first ten days of May exceeded the last ten days of April by 24.5 percent. The proportion of deposits from private enterprises has also increased from 1 percent to more than 10 percent. An inspection of depositors revealed very few perfunctory accounts, proving that the state bank has established considerable prestige among private industrial and commercial enterprises. Since the first half of this month, field staff have also been actively responsible, resulting in more than three times the number of accounts opened compared to the second half of April. However, there are still some shortcomings in the current deposit business of the office, such as some focusing only on the number of accounts and not maintaining sufficient contact with existing account holders.
    [Another Report] The Roosevelt Road Office of the bank has also made significant progress, with an increasing number of depositors, establishing a foundation for lending business. In terms of procedures, they strive for simplification and speed, insisting on completing one account in ten minutes, with dedicated staff receiving customers, implementing an enterprise-oriented approach. Especially in April, due to the efforts of field staff, the original plan to establish 1,000 accounts was exceeded, reaching 1,082 accounts. Due to the increase in deposit figures, the office began to handle credit overdrafts from the beginning of April. The overdraft targets are mainly public enterprises, with industrial enterprises as the main focus among private enterprises, and general commerce is also given overdrafts at its discretion. It is insisted that industrial overdrafts in private enterprises do not exceed 100,000 yuan with a two-month limit, and commercial overdrafts do not exceed 50,000 yuan with a one-month limit, based on an average of 80 percent or 40 percent of the book deposit amount. From the end of April, the office also launched industrial fixed-term credit loans. Along with the development of business, the average number of business vouchers in early May exceeded twice that of April. The total number of exchange notes submitted and received daily is often around 400. In addition, the use of loans is monitored at all times. For example, Ruida Hat Factory, on the pretext of purchasing raw materials, borrowed 200,000 yuan, then used part of it to pay taxes, and the remaining funds were used to buy flour for storage, not for production. After verification, in addition to criticism, the principal and interest of the loan were immediately recovered.

　　津人民银行两办事处
  　存款业务开展
    罗斯福路办事处举办信用透支
    【本报讯】津市人民银行北马路办事处，存款业务获得很大进展。目前往来户已达七百三十余户，四月份存款总额，超出三月份的二·八倍，五月份上旬超出四月下旬的百分之二四·五，私营企业的存款比重也由百分之一，增加到百分之十以上，在检查存户中，敷衍的户头极少，这证明了国家银行在私营工商业中，已建立了相当威信。自本月份上半月来，外勤人员亦积极负责，故使开户成绩超出了四月份下半月的三倍多，但目前该处存款业务中，仍然存在若干缺点，例如有的只顾户头多，而对于已开户的联系非常不够。
    【又讯】该行罗斯福路办事处业务，亦有显著进展，存户日益增加，建立了放款业务的基础。在手续上则力求简化迅速，坚持十分钟办完一户，专人接待顾客，贯彻了企业化的方针，特别在四月份，由于外勤人员的努力，在四月已超过原订建立一千户的计划，达到了一千零八十二户。因存款数字增加，从四月上旬起，该处开始办理信用透支。透支对象以公营企业为主，私营企业中则以工业为主要对象，一般商业亦酌给透支。并坚持了私营企业中工业透支不超过十万，限期两个月，商业透支不超过五万，期限一个月，并以帐面存额平均百分之八十或百分之四十为标准。由四月下旬起，该处又举办工业定期信用放款。伴随业务的发展，五月上旬营业传票平均超过四月份的两倍。每日提出收进的交换票据，总数常在四百张左右。此外，对贷款用途，并随时予以监督。如瑞大制帽工厂，假购买原料为由，贷款二十万元后，即以一部缴税，余款购面存放，并非用于生产。经查明属实后，除予以批评外，立即追回借款本息。
