North China People's Government Issues Directive
  Implement Cadre Appointment System and Register Special County-Level Cadres
    [Our Newspaper] The North China People's Government recently issued a directive to the administrative offices, provincial governments, and directly governed municipal governments, concerning the implementation of the cadre appointment system and the registration of special county-level cadres. The directive states: Recently, cadre transfers have been frequent. Whenever there are cadre changes, the administrative offices, provincial governments, and directly governed municipal governments fail to submit requests to this government for approval in advance. After the changes, they also fail to promptly report to this government for record, making it difficult for this government to understand the overall cadre situation in the region and manage it effectively. In order to gradually and effectively grasp and manage the situation in the future, in addition to various necessary cadre systems currently under research and awaiting promulgation, it is hereby decided:
    1.  Any appointment, dismissal, or transfer of cadres at the level of commissioner and director in the administrative offices and provincial governments, and bureau chief and above in the directly governed municipal governments, must be submitted to this government for approval. If changes need to be made promptly due to special circumstances, they should be reported to this government for retroactive record. The Cadre (Appointment Request) Registration Form for Political Power, as stipulated by this government, must be attached when submitting the request for appointment. Due to the current frequent cadre transfers, and the inconsistent dates of completion and varying items on the registration forms previously submitted, difficulties have arisen in understanding and compiling statistics on cadres. Therefore, a standardized format for the registration form is hereby issued. All commissioners, directors, bureau chiefs, and cadres above that level throughout the region must complete and submit the forms within two weeks of receiving this directive.
    2.  County-level cadres must also complete the Cadre Registration Form for Political Power. Because county-level cadres are more dispersed and the form contains more items, it can be submitted within one month of receiving this directive. A separate County-Level Cadre Registration Form is being issued, and this form must be completed and submitted within two weeks of receiving it.
    3.  In the future, any changes in cadres above the county level in each region must be reported to this government on a monthly basis. The registration forms for newly promoted cadres must also be submitted at any time.

　　华北人民政府颁发训令
  　执行干部请委制登记专县级干部
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷训令各行署、省政府及直辖市府，执行干部请委制度与登记专县级干部，该训令称：近因干部调动频繁，各行署、省府、直辖市府，每当干部变动之际，不能事前呈请本府批准，变动之后，又不能及时具报本府备案，致使本府对于全区干部情况不能及时了解，难于掌握管理，为今后能够做到逐步确实掌握与管理起见，除应有的各种关于干部制度正在研究待颁外，兹决定：
    一、凡各行署省府之专员，处长级及直辖市府之局长级以上干部任免调动时必须呈本府批准，如因特殊情况而需及时变动者，应报本府追认备案。呈委时必须附本府规定之政权干部（请委）登记表。由于目前干部调动频繁，及以往所呈之登记表填写日期前后不一，表格项目亦各不同，在了解与统计干部时发生困难，故特统一规定登记表之式样发下，务于接到二周内将全区所有专员、处、局长级以上干部填齐报来。
    二、县长级干部亦须填写政权干部登记表，因县长级干部所在地区更加分散，且该表项目较多，可于接到后一月内报来，另发去县长级干部登记表，此表务于接到后两周内填齐报来。
    三、今后各地区县长级以上干部之变动，须按月向本府呈报，其新提拔之干部，并须将登记表随时呈来。
