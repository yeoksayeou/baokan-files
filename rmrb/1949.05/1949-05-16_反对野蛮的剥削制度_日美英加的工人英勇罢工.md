　　Resisting the Barbaric Exploitation System
　　Heroic Strikes by Workers in Japan, the United States, Britain, and Canada

　　In the capitalist world, the working class in many countries is struggling against the barbaric system of exploitation. In Japan, 450,000 coal miners, because the capitalists refused their demands for wage increases, began their second round of strikes on the 7th, and started their third round of strikes again on the 14th. In the United States, 65,000 workers at the largest automobile manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, went on strike on the 5th to oppose a particularly brutal method of exploitation—the speed-up system. The total number of workers on strike and consequently laid off has reached 150,000. In Britain, 36,000 workers in more than fifty mines in Lancashire were involved in strikes against overtime work in the mines on the 9th, and it is continuing to expand. In Canada, 3,000 asbestos workers began a strike on the 5th to demand wage increases. The striking workers erected barricades and engaged in twenty-four hours of heroic self-defense against Canadian police equipped with rifles and tear gas. The workers, regardless of the reactionary government's various acts of destruction, are still fighting persistently. (Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 14th)

　　反对野蛮的剥削制度
  　日美英加的工人英勇罢工
    在资本主义世界，不少国家中的工人阶级正在为反对野蛮的剥削制度而斗争。日本四十五万煤矿工人因资方拒绝他们增加工资的要求，于七日开始第二次轮回罢工，十四日又开始第三次轮回罢工。在美国，最大的汽车制造公司福特汽车公司的工人六万五千人，于五日起进入了反对特别的残酷的剥削方法——赶快制度的罢工。罢工及因而停工的工人总数，已达十五万人。在英国、兰开厦那五十余处矿场的工人三万六千人于九日卷入了反对矿井中超时工作的罢工，并正在继续扩大中。在加拿大，三千石绵工人为要求增加工资于五日开始罢工。罢工工人垒起了障碍物，对配备有步枪、催泪弹的加拿大警察，进行了二十四小时的英勇的自卫斗争。工人们不顾反动政府的种种摧残，仍在坚持地战斗着。（新华社北平十四日电）
