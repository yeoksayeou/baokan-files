　　【Tangshan Electric】With the assistance of state-owned trade organizations, the Qixin Cement Company Workers' Cooperative in Tangshan has been systematically collecting workers' in-kind wages (cement coupons) and organizing all factory workers, with business gradually expanding. The cooperative has grown in the struggle against unscrupulous merchants. In January of this year, due to transportation not yet being restored, product sales being difficult, and the lack of circulating funds, the factory owed workers' wages for more than two months. During the Lunar New Year, the factory had to issue cement coupons (in-kind checks) in lieu of wages. The Qixin workers, having received a large number of cement coupons, were eager to exchange them for cash. Some unscrupulous merchants, thinking they had an opportunity, lingered around the entrance of Qixin, attempting to seize a large number of coupons at extremely low prices of 900,000 to 1,000,000 yuan per ton (the market price of cement at that time was already very low at 1,200,000 yuan per ton). With the assistance of the factory's trade union and Changcheng Bank (now the People's Bank), the cooperative established a temporary organization and obtained a loan of 2,500,000 yuan (RMB) from the bank. They collected 1,666 tons of cement coupons from workers, and through the trade company, distributed daily necessities at low prices, solving the workers' urgent needs for the New Year and preventing the merchants' tricks from succeeding. Later, with the assistance of the Tangshan Military Control Commission and the trade company, the workers' cooperative continued to collect 4,220 tons of cement coupons and transported them to the Northeast, exchanging them for more than 2,100 tons of sorghum, which was distributed to the workers in batches. Because the quantity was large, some workers needed to sell the sorghum they received in exchange for cement coupons. Some speculative merchants again wanted to take the opportunity to lower the market price and seize them. The cooperative purchased the sorghum voluntarily sold by the workers in large quantities at prices slightly higher than the market price, protecting the interests of the workers. At present, after full deliberation and publicity, the factory's cooperative has extensively collected worker shares. 2,169 people have purchased shares, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of workers in the factory. In mid-May, the members' representatives directly elected and formally established the cooperative's committee. The Tangshan Supply and Marketing Cooperative and trade company purchased a large number of daily necessities such as grain and cloth, and established a workers' canteen and a soap-making factory. It was decided that operations would officially begin on the 26th, serving the welfare of all factory workers.

  　供给职工必需品
  　“启新”职工合作社大发展
    【唐山电】唐山启新洋灰公司职工合作社在国营贸易机关协助下，有计划地收兑职工的实物工资（洋灰券），组织全厂职工，业务逐步开展。该合作社在是与奸商进行斗争中成长起来的。今年一月间，厂方因当时交通尚未恢复，产品销路困难，资金无法周转，欠了职工两个多月的工资未发。在旧历年关，只好以洋灰券（实物支票）折发了职工的工资。启新职工领下大批洋灰券，都急于要换现钱花用。一些奸商以为有机可乘，便终日徘徊在启新门前，企图以每吨九十万元至一百万元的极低价格大量套夺（按当时洋灰市价每吨一百二十万元，原已很低）。该厂合作社在职工会和长城银行（现为人民银行）的协助下，成立临时机构，由银行贷款二百五十万元（人民币），收兑职工洋灰券的一部一六六六吨，并通过贸易公司，低价配售生活必需品，解决了工人年关的急需，使奸商的伎俩无法施展。职工合作社后又得到唐山军管会和贸易公司的协助，继续收集了职工的洋灰券四二二零吨，连同收兑的部分运销东北，换回高粱二千一百余吨，分批发还职工。因为数量庞大，职工以洋灰券换得高粱后，有的需要出卖，一些投机奸商又想乘机压低市价进行套夺，合作社即以稍高于市场的价格大批收买了职工自动出卖的高粱，保障了职工的利益。现该厂合作社经过充分酝酿宣传，大量收集职工入股，已有二一六九人入股，占全厂人数百分之七十三。本月中旬由社员代表直接选举，正式成立起社务委员会，由唐山市供销总社及贸易公司购进大批粮布等日用物资，并开设了职工食堂和造胰工厂，决定于二十六日正式开始营业，为全厂职工的福利而服务。
