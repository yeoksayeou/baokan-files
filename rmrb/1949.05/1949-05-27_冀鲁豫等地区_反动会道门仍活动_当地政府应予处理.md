　　Areas Such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan
　　Reactionary Secret Societies Still Active
　　Local Governments Should Handle Them
　　[This newspaper reports] Since the North China People's Government announced the prohibition of secret societies and Daoist sects on January 4th, secret societies and Daoist sects in areas with weaker work, such as newly liberated areas and semi-old areas in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hebei-Southern Hebei, and Chahar, have continued to spread rumors and deception, and even organize counter-revolutionary activities such as riots. The types of secret societies and Daoist sects vary, including Buddhism, the Central Wuji Dao, the Blue Sky White Sun Red Earth Dao, Yiguandao, the Sage Dao, and the Returning Home Dao. The Central Wuji Dao and other extremely feudal and reactionary organizations in Hebei-Southern Hebei specialize in sabotaging land reform and supporting the front lines, and opposing women's participation in production. These secret societies and Daoist sects use some commercial firms to cover up their reactionary activities. The Buddhism in Zhuoxian County, Chahar, built four major "Tianqiao Grain Shops" in Chengguan, namely Jianli, Fengheng, etc., in January of this year, and at the same time set up more than ten small grain shops in villages such as Qianpu and Lijiahuang as their concealed agencies, spreading rumors to confuse the public and levying exorbitant Dao fees of more than 1,100 shi. Some were discovered by us, and reactionary objects such as weapons and seals were seized. After the local government arrested their leaders, it held mass meetings to expose the facts of their activities that violated the decrees of the People's Government, and called on the deceived masses to accuse the criminals. The Central Wuji Dao and the Taishan Niangniang Association in Fucheng County, the third district of Henan, Hebei and Shandong, also spread rumors everywhere to deceive the masses, provoke relations between us and the masses, and murdered the mother and wife of Comrade Wang, a Fucheng worker. In developing their organizations, these secret societies and Daoist sects first carry out superstitious propaganda to the masses, and then carry out terrorist rule after they join the religion, allowing entry but not exit. Chen Xiaomin, the leader of the Central Wuji Dao in Gezhenyuan Village, the fifth district of Fucheng, attempted to organize a riot and said to the members: "Whoever doesn't go to kill will be killed!" When many people knew they had been deceived and asked to withdraw, they threatened them with paying grain and other means to prevent them from withdrawing. They have done all kinds of evil and have become a small pawn in the dying struggle of the Kuomintang bandit gang. After the people are mobilized, they will be crushed to pieces. Now, since the North China People's Government issued a ban on the activities of secret societies, everything has turned from public to secret. The local people's governments should handle them according to the specific situation and in accordance with the law.

　　冀鲁豫等地区
  　反动会道门仍活动
  　当地政府应予处理
    【本报讯】自华北人民政府一月四日公布取缔会门、道门活动后，冀鲁豫、冀南、察哈尔等地新区半老区等工作薄弱的地区会、道门继续进行造谣欺骗，甚至组织暴动等反革命活动。会、道门种类不一，有佛教、中央无极道、青天白日满地红道、一贯道、圣贤道、还乡道等。冀南的中央无极道等极端封建反动的组织，专门破坏土地改革和支援前线，反对妇女参加生产。这些会、道门用一些商号来掩护其反动活动。察哈尔涿县佛教，即于今年一月在城关建利奉恒等四大“天桥粮栈”，同时在前铺、李家皇等村设立十多个小粮栈作为其掩蔽机关，造谣惑众，苛征道费一千一百余石。有些当被我发觉，查获武器图章等反动物件。当地政府将其头子逮捕后，召开群众大会，揭露其违犯人民政府法令的活动的事实，号召被欺骗的群众对该犯进行控诉。冀鲁豫河南三分区复程丰县之中央无极道、泰山奶奶会，亦到处造谣欺骗群众，挑拨我与群众关系，并杀害我复程工作人员王某之母与妻。这些会、道门在发展其组织中，首先对群众作迷信的宣传，入教后即进行恐怖统治，许进不许出。复程五区格针园村中央无极道道首陈孝敏企图组织暴动，曾向会员说：“谁不去杀谁！”当不少群众知道被骗要求退出时，又以交粮等威胁不许退出。作恶多端，成了国民党匪帮垂死挣扎的一个小喽罗，在人民发动起来后，他们便会被打得粉碎，现在，各地会道门自华北人民政府发布取缔会门活动后，一切均由公开转向秘密。当地人民政府应根据具体情况依法处理。
