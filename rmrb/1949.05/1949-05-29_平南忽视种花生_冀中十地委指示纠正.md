　　Pingnan Neglects Peanut Planting
  　Jizhong Tenth Regional Committee Orders Correction
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Zhao Gang reports: The Jizhong Tenth District has the following urgent problems to be solved in the rush planting after the rain:
    (1) Some county committees and districts do not have a clear understanding in their leadership thinking about the central link of using peanut planting to promote general crops, and they have not grasped it firmly in actual implementation. Therefore, most villagers are actively planting general crops, while very few are planting peanuts. (2) Some county and district cadres and some village cadres still have remnants of coercive commandism. (3) More importantly, it is urgent to solve the problem of peanut seed shortage. Because all levels did not pay enough attention to and prepare for this problem in the rush planting of cotton before the rain, all localities are reflecting a lack of seeds when it is urgently needed to plant peanuts, and they lack confidence in completing the peanut planting. According to the above situation, the Jizhong Tenth Regional Committee has made the following measures and instructed all counties to implement them quickly. (1) Explain the free trade decree of the democratic government, publicize the new agricultural tax regulations and collection methods, especially the benefits of planting peanuts, to eliminate people's concerns. (2) Regarding the seed problem, in addition to the district's unified purchase and immediate distribution to the counties, each county should also purchase and lend to households that are really short of seeds according to the number of grain loaned for seeds allocated by the district. In addition, mobilize the masses to borrow and exchange from relatives and friends. (3) If there is a real shortage of peanut land, mobilize the masses to plant peanuts in the wheat fields that have reduced yields due to drought. Areas and villages that have completed peanut planting should also mobilize the masses to plant as much as possible beyond the plan. (4) Neglecting peanut planting and residual coercive commandism should be corrected immediately.
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Zhao Gang reports: The well-digging and cotton-planting campaign in the Jizhong Tenth District, which lasted for a month from late April to mid-May, has now been completed and exceeded the district's target of 450,000 mu of cotton. According to incomplete statistics from the entire district: more than 627,500 mu of cotton have been planted, exceeding the total target by more than 170,000 mu. In addition, more than 36,000 wells have been dug, and more than 157,800 mu of peanuts have been planted. The counties that completed cotton planting faster and more were Gu'an and Wuqing.
    [News from Chahar Province] On May 21, most areas of Jianping Prefecture experienced the first thorough rain. The commissioner's office issued an emergency notice that day, instructing all counties to temporarily suspend other work and concentrate all their efforts on leading the masses to rush planting, eliminate all raw and cooked wasteland, complete the planting of major autumn crops, and ensure that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated; especially peanuts should be given a final effort to strive to exceed the plan. It also specifically stipulated that students in normal schools and senior elementary schools whose families have no labor force can be granted leave for five to seven days to mobilize and organize all available manpower and animal power to participate in planting. And check the substitute cultivation work to ensure that the land of martyrs, soldiers, and workers' families is planted first. It particularly emphasized that the focus of leadership should be placed on disaster areas. (Yao Fu)

　　平南忽视种花生
  　冀中十地委指示纠正
    【本报讯】本报记者赵刚报导：冀中十分区在雨后突击播种中有以下急待解决的问题：
    （一）有些县委和区，对点种花生推动一般作物这一中心环节，从领导思想上不够明确，实际执行中也没抓紧。因此，多数村庄群众都在积极播种一般作物，而点种花生的很少。（二）在某些县区干部和部分村干部中，仍然存在着强迫命令的残余思想。（三）更重要的是急须解决花生种籽困难问题。由于各级在雨前突击植棉中对此问题重视和准备不足，直到目前迫切需要点种花生时，各地均反映籽种缺乏，完成点种花生信心不足。冀中十地委根据以上情况，又做出如下措施，指示各县迅速执行。（一）解释民主政府贸易自由法令，宣传农业新税则及征收办法，特别是种花生的好处等，消除群众顾虑。（二）关于种籽问题，除分区统一购买立即发到各县外，各县亦应按照分区拨去之籽种贷粮数目，迅速购买贷给真正缺种户。另外号召群众投亲找友互借互换。（三）如真正缺少花生地的，发动群众在因天旱而减收的麦陇里点种花生。现已完成种花生的区村，亦应发动群众尽可能超计划的多种。（四）忽视点种花生和残存的强迫命令思想，应立即纠正。
    【本报讯】本报记者赵刚报导：冀中十分区的打井点棉运动，从四月下旬开始至五月中旬底止，历时一个月，现已完成并超过全区四十五万亩的植棉任务。据全分区不完全的统计：共植棉六十二万七千五百余亩，超过总任务十七万多亩。另外共打井三万六千余眼，点花生十五万七千八百多亩，全区完成植棉较快又多的为固安、武清等县。
    【察省讯】五月二十一日，建屏专署各县大部地区第一次普降透雨。该署当日即发出紧急通知，各县立即将其他工作暂行停止，集中全力领导群众突击播种，将所有一切生熟荒地全部消灭，完成大秋作物播种，保证不留一亩白地；尤其花生更应最后努力，争取超过计划。又具体规定师范高小学生家中无劳动力者，可准假五天至七天，要把一切所能参加播种的人力、畜力动员组织起来。并检查代耕工作，保证烈、军、工属之地尽先下种。特着重指出：领导重点放在灾区。（药夫）
