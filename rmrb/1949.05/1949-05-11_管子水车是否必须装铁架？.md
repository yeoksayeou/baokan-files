Is an Iron Frame Necessary for a Flange Pump?

    The public-owned waterwheel factory in Baqie Village, Sixth District, Tang County, was originally founded by the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society. Since December of last year, when the Chahar Province Water Conservancy Promotion Society took over, some improvements have been made in production, such as abolishing the equal wage system, increasing the salaries of technical workers, and carrying out preliminary internal division of labor, all of which have achieved considerable success. Currently, the number of public and private waterwheel factories in the village has grown to five. However, a serious problem has now arisen: ① There is too much accumulation of finished products, and there is no way to sell them in a short period of time (currently there are about 1,500 waterwheels in stock); ② The production of one waterwheel requires about 350 jin of pig iron. Assuming an average output of five waterwheels per day, the monthly requirement is about 50,000 jin of pig iron. The problem of supplying this raw material cannot be solved. This makes the turnover of capital inflexible, and expanding reproduction is hindered. What is the key to this problem? My preliminary research with Director Liu of the factory suggests that the key to solving the entire problem seems to lie in whether each flange pump needs to be equipped with a 300-plus jin pig iron frame. Because installing a 300-plus jin heavy pig iron frame makes raw materials a big problem, and at the same time, it restricts the price of waterwheels from being lowered, greatly limiting the sales of waterwheels (because each waterwheel costs more than seven shi of refined grain, which ordinary farmers cannot afford), thus creating a series of difficult problems such as inflexible capital turnover.
    Is it really necessary to install a 300-plus jin heavy iron frame on a flange pump? In fact, this is not the case. The flange pump was invented in 1920. When it was first invented, it did not use an iron frame, but a wooden frame. The inventor was Zhang Zhenhua from Dachang'an Village, Gaocheng, Hebei, who is now in charge of the smelting furnace at the factory. The flange pump he invented was initially manufactured and promoted at the Lemin Factory in Shijiazhuang and was welcomed by farmers. The reason was precisely because the wooden frame had two major advantages: low price and light weight. Why must we now retrofit a 300-plus jin pig iron frame? If we still retrofit a wooden frame, then the problems of raw materials, sales of finished products, and capital turnover would all be easier to solve. I have discussed this idea with Director Liu repeatedly, and he also believes it makes sense. The day before yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that a similar problem had occurred at the Xinji waterwheel factory. I am now putting forward this small opinion for the reference of comrades who understand the industry.
    (Liu Yi)
    (The development of waterwheels from wooden frames to iron frames must have its advantages and reasons; the questions raised by Comrade Liu Yi are indeed worthy of study. A shortage of raw materials and high prices will inevitably affect the promotion of waterwheels. In the current drought situation, which is more suitable for current needs, waterwheels with iron frames or wooden frames? We hope that those who understand waterwheels will provide their opinions. – Editor)

    管子水车是否必须装铁架？
    唐县六区拔茄村公营水车工厂，原由华北水利推进社创办，从去年十二月由察省水利推进社接办以来，在生产上已作了一些改进，如取消工资均等制，提高了技术工人的待遇、进行内部初步的分工等，都获得相当成绩。现该村公私水车工厂已发展到五家。但当前却发生了严重的问题：①生产成品堆积太多，短时内没办法推销出去（现存水车共约一千五百辆上下）；②生产一辆水车需生铁三百五十斤左右，平均每天按出产五辆水车计算，每月即需生铁五万斤左右，这个生铁原料供给的问题解决不了；这样使资本的流转不灵，扩大再生产受到障碍，这问题的关键何在呢？我和该厂刘主任初步研究的结果，认为全部问题解决的关键，似乎在于每辆管子水车需要不需要装置一个三百多斤的生铁架。因为要装上一个三百多斤重的生铁架子，使原料成了大问题，同时限制着水车价格不能减低，大大限制了水车的销路（因为每辆车要七石多细粮，普通农家买不起）因而产生了资本的周转不灵等一连串的困难问题。
    管子水车是不是非得装上了一个三百多斤重的铁架子呢？事实上并不是如此。管子水车是民国九年发明的，一开始发明的时候并没有用铁架子，而是用的木架子，发明人是河北藁城大常安村的张振华，现在该厂熔铁炉掌把。他发明的管子水车，开始在石门乐民工厂制造推广，受到农民欢迎。原因正是由于用木架具有价廉、轻便两大优点。现在为什么一定要改装上三百多斤的生铁架呢？如仍改装木架，则原料问题，成品推销问题，以及资本周转等一连串问题，都好解决了。我这意见曾和刘主任商之再三，他也认为有道理。前天在报上看到辛集水车工厂也发生了类似的问题，特将我这一小意见提出来，供懂行的同志们研究参考。
    （刘一）
    （水车由木架发展到铁架，一定有它的好处和道理；刘一同志所提问题也确有值得研究的地方，原料缺，价钱高，必然影响水车的推广，在目前亢旱的情况下，水车装铁架与装木架，那种更适合当前的需要？希懂水车者提供意见。——编者）
