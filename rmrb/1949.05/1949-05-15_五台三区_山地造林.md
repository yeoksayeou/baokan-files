    Wutai Third District
    Mountain Afforestation
    [This newspaper dispatch] Wutai Third District is characterized by continuous mountain peaks. Due to the scarcity of forests, the climate is imbalanced, and soil erosion is severe. Approximately over 19,000 mu of terraced fields and slopes consist of yellow sandy soil with poor harvests (these lands account for more than 80% of the cultivated area). During the rainy season, the embankments of these terraced fields are often destroyed by mountain floods. To transform this situation and develop production, the district proposed sowing cypress trees on barren mountains at the spring production meeting. Twenty-five villages voluntarily offered to mobilize the entire village to collectively afforest, with seeds provided by the Forestry and Animal Husbandry Bureau. Village cadres and experienced farmers studied planting methods based on specific conditions. Some villages directly sowed on barren mountains; others, fearing that seedlings would freeze, first cultivated seedlings in each household and then afforested barren mountains during the rainy season. The masses said that afforestation is a good thing. However, due to a lack of close leadership, some ideological and specific problems have not been well resolved. Consequently, although seeds were distributed around the Qingming Festival, the work was not completed even after Guyu.
    1. The masses lack a long-term construction mentality: Because sowing on barren mountains mainly involves conifers, which grow slowly, and collective afforestation is common in villages, there is a lack of in-depth mobilization. For example, some old men said, "Children! Plant well! I won't benefit from it in my lifetime." Therefore, it is necessary to widely publicize and make the masses realize that afforestation is a century-long construction plan. After an old man from Lvjia Village understood this principle, he said, "Even if I don't benefit, my children and grandchildren will! There will always be benefits." 2. The land rights of mountain slopes have not been clearly defined, which affects afforestation. According to old customs, a certain mountain slope belonged to a certain household, and the boundaries were also specified. During the land reform, slope fields were clearly allocated, but barren mountains were not clearly allocated. Some land certificates were not filled in, and villages still adhered to the old ownership. Some had two mu of cultivated land on a ten-mu slope, and the area on the land certificate was the area of cultivated land, while the boundaries were the boundaries of the entire slope. The slope owner was unwilling to afforest because the slope was not clearly owned by him and did not want others to afforest; others were afraid of afforesting for the slope owner and were also unwilling to afforest. 3. Some masses do not listen and go to forbidden mountains to cut firewood and graze sheep, damaging tree seedlings and burning mountains. This also affects confidence in afforestation, fearing that hard work will be wasted and destroyed. All these affect the development of afforestation work. Therefore, to carry out large-scale afforestation on barren mountains, it is necessary to overcome these obstacles. District and village cadres should learn common knowledge of afforestation and forest protection to facilitate regular management. Seeds sown on barren mountains are easily pecked at by birds. A large amount of poison, such as red lead, should be prepared to protect the growth of seedlings. There are many mountains in our North China mountainous area, and mountain afforestation is worth paying attention to and researching.

    五台三区
    山地造林
    【本报讯】五台三区，山峰连绵，因森林过少，气候失调，土壤被侵蚀严重。约有一万九千余亩黄沙质的梯田和坡地，收成不好，（这些地约占耕地面积百分之八十以上），如遇雨季，这些梯田堰多被山水冲毁。为改造这种情况，发展生产，该区在春季生产会议上提出荒山播种柏树，二十五个村自动提出要发动全村集体造林，种籽由林牧局供给。村干及老农根据具体情况研究种法，有的村荒山直播；有的村怕小苗冻死，先由各户育苗，成苗后再行雨季荒山造林。群众都说，造林是好事情。但因未抓紧领导，有些思想问题和具体问题没很好解决。致清明节发下种籽，谷雨后尚未完成。
    一、群众中缺乏长期建设思想：因荒山播种多为针叶树类，生长缓慢，村中又多行集体造林，缺乏深入动员、如有的老头说：“娃娃们！你们好好植吧！我这一辈子得不上利了。”因此必须广泛的宣传，使群众认识造林植树是百年建设大计。如吕家庄一老头明白这道理以后说：“咱得不上利还有儿孙哩！总是有好处。”二、山坡地权未明确确定，影响造林。旧时习惯某一个山坡为某户所有，四至也有规定。土改中坡田已明确分配，荒山未明确分配。有的土地证上未曾填写，村中仍袭为旧主所有。有的在十亩大的一坡中有二亩耕田，土地证上填的面积是耕地面积，而四至却是全坡的四至；坡主因坡未明确归他所有，自己不愿造林，也不愿旁人造林；旁人怕给坡主造了林，也不愿去造林。三、有些群众不听话，到禁山上割柴放羊糟踏了树苗及烧山等。这也影响造林信心，怕白费辛苦遭破坏。这些都影响造林工作的开展。因此想大规模的荒山造林，必须克服这些障碍，区村干部要学习造林护林常识，以便于经常管理。荒山播种籽，易为鸟啄食，应备大量的毒剂如铅丹等，以保树苗生长。我华北山区很多，山地造林是值得注意研究的。
