    Tanya was the name of the unwavering Soviet heroine who sacrificed herself in the Great Patriotic War, her real name was Zoya. Her heroic deeds have been extolled throughout the world and made into a film. Translator.
    Dear friends! I am a Soviet woman, I am a mother. Today I would like to say a few words on behalf of the millions of Soviet mothers who have not yet forgotten the horrors of the war launched by the fascists. We still remember the destroyed cities, the burnt villages, the groans of the elderly, and the cries of orphans! Many of us have become widows, and many have lost sons, brothers, and husbands. I, too, lost the most precious things in my life during this war—a son and a daughter. Because of their merits, they were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
    My children lost their father early in life, my husband passed away when they were very young. I worked as a primary school teacher, raising my children. We raised our children for peaceful labor. From a young age, our children saw how the Soviet people faithfully worked for the benefit of the Soviet motherland. They saw that in a socialist country, there are no oppressed and oppressors. Here, the most honorable thing is labor, which creates a peaceful and happy life for all the Soviet people.
    In the family, in schools, and in children's and youth social organizations, we teach our children to love their motherland infinitely, instill in them respect and friendship for all peace-loving people, and instill disdain and hatred for those who enslave people.
    In our country, the path to all knowledge, science, and art, and the path to fully developing their creativity and abilities, is broadly opened before children. My daughter Zoya loved Russian history and literature. Our heroic past, the strength and glory of the Soviet people, and the noble purity and moral models of mankind fascinated her. Her favorite writers were Pushkin, Belinsky, Nekrasov, Tolstoy, Gorky, and Mayakovsky. My daughter had a smart mind and the heart of a fiery and brave fighter.
    When the fascist aggressors treacherously attacked our peaceful country, our youth stood at the forefront of the fighters to save our country! And also to save all mankind!
    In 1941, my Zoya was eighteen years old. At this promising age, at the beginning of her career, she dreamed of happiness, dreamed of love, dreamed of how to work more and more effectively for the benefit of her beloved motherland. But her dreams were not realized, and the fascist bandits invaded our peaceful country. After the October battles for Moscow began, Zoya said to me:
    "Mom! I'm going to the front to join the guerrillas. Mom! You know the fascists are threatening Moscow, and I can't stand by and do nothing. I will be proud to fight against fascism. You should also be proud of me for going to the front. Just don't send me off with tears in your eyes!"
    When we parted, Zoya said to me: "I will come back to see you as a hero, or I will die a hero. But Mom, don't be sad." Then she smiled. Millions of our children went to the front line to defend their motherland with deep confidence in victory.
    Zoya and a group of guerrillas crossed the battle line and went to the enemy-occupied positions. They endured great poverty and hardship and fought the enemy. At the end of November 1941, Zoya performed her last feat. Zoya sneaked into the village of Petrishchevo, which was occupied by the fascists. While she was performing her mission, she was captured by German soldiers. The fascist executioners tortured my daughter, they used all means to torture her; whipping her with whips, hitting her with gun butts, and forcing her to walk naked in the bitter cold. Cold-blooded murderers and executioners took photos of her on the gallows with a noose around her neck, and took pleasure in it. But my Zoya loved her people, she was a loyal daughter of the motherland, firm and resolute. She answered the executioners' torture with contempt. Before her death, she said to the peasants gathered around the gallows: "Comrades! I am not afraid to die. It is an honor to die for my people."
    Zoya shouted to the fascist soldiers: "Now you are hanging me, but I am not alone, we are 200 million people, you cannot hang them all, they will definitely avenge me! In any case, victory belongs to us!"
    When the executioner tightened the noose and strangled Zoya's throat, she squeezed the noose with both hands, loosened it slightly, and shouted with all her might: "Comrades, farewell, fight! Don't be afraid, Stalin is with us, Stalin will definitely come!" My daughter died like this, uttering the name of Stalin and with confidence in victory.
    The fascists killed my daughter, but her glorious name spread throughout the Soviet Union and the world, her name became a symbol of the heroic deeds and bravery of all progressive mankind. Millions of young men and women responded to her dying call to fight.
    My youngest son, Alexander, who was seventeen years old, also went to the front to defend the motherland, eliminate the enemy, and avenge Zoya. He said: "I love my motherland no less than Zoya." I blessed my son and said: "I hope you are like Zoya."
    My son fought with the same troops that executed Zoya. He was a captain in the Guards, the commander of an automatic gun. He and his soldiers went from Gzhatsk to East Prussia. During the fierce battle for Koenigsberg, my son bravely sacrificed himself! I carried his body back and buried him in my hometown, Moscow, next to Zoya's grave. The black marble monument on Zoya's grave is inscribed with the words: "The most precious thing a person has is life, and each person is only endowed with one life, which should be lived in such a way that when she dies she can say: all life and strength have been contributed to the most beautiful cause in the world—the struggle for human liberation."
    The fascists took my children from me, my loss is great, but I am not the only one, there are many, many mothers who sacrificed their children for the freedom of their beloved motherland and for the freedom of mankind.
    The Soviet people will forever sing the immortal feats of the millions of Soviet people who gave their lives in the bloody war against fascism.
    Now, our country, which is full of peaceful construction labor, is victoriously healing the serious wounds of war. Our country wants a solid and just peace throughout the world.
    In memory of my Zoya, young men and women often come to visit me, they tell me about their progress, and exchange their ideals and plans with me. Looking at their young faces and listening to their happy laughter, a feeling of terror about their future suddenly strikes me. The enemies of peace are plotting new wars, military alliances are being concluded between imperialists, cannons are being built, shells and atomic bombs are being prepared to kill and set fires again, and peaceful people are being crippled.
    The aggressors are primarily preparing to use their military power against the bulwark of peace, the Soviet Union. However, the war that the imperialists are preparing is not only anti-Soviet, but will also infringe upon every source of peace. War has destroyed thousands of peaceful families around the world, sacrificing and destroying millions of lives.
    Comrades who are fighting for peace, I ask you: Did our children's blood flow in vain? Will the peace that was won for our children's precious lives, for the precious tears of mothers and orphans and widows, be destroyed by this small group of imperialists? No, we will never let them do this! We have gathered here from every corner of the earth to expose the warmongers and issue them a serious warning. If we millions of people can unite in our struggle and be unwavering, then no force can stand in front of our unity.
    When you return to your country, tell your people about the heinous conspiracy of the enemies of mankind. Then a new army composed of ordinary people who yearn for labor and peace will join our front line in the struggle for peace. We will grow to be twice or three times as strong.
    Outstanding representatives of science, art, and literature are gathered here. The words of writers, the pens of painters, and the power of thought of scholars are great. Please use these weapons for the cause of peace! Educate the younger generation with a true democratic spirit and a spirit of actively fighting for peace!
    On this platform, I also ask all the fathers and mothers in the world to educate their children to become fighters who love freedom and strive for peace. Then they will be able to defend their right to exist, and defend freedom and labor.
    I believe, I know: we will definitely win in the struggle for peace. In the struggle for our children's lives, happiness, and our future, no force can destroy the will of the people.

    丹娘的母亲科斯莫捷美扬斯卡娅
    在巴黎和平大会上的讲演词
    孙岷译
    丹娘就是苏联在祖国战争中坚忍不拔而牺牲的女英雄，她的真名叫卓娅。她英勇的事迹曾为全世界所传颂，并摄成电影。    译者
    亲爱的朋友们！我是一个苏联的妇女，我是一个母亲。今天我愿代表苏联几百万尚未遗忘法西斯所发动的战争的恐怖的母亲们来说几句话。我们还记得破坏了的城市，焚毁的村镇，老年人的呻吟和孤儿的哭泣！我们中间有许多人变成了寡妇，许多人失去了儿子、兄弟和丈夫。我在这次战争中也失去了我生命中最宝贵的东西——一个儿子和一个女儿。由于他们有功，死后曾追授以苏联英雄的称号。
    我的孩子们早年丧父，他们很小的时候，我的丈夫便去世了。我当了小学教师，教养自己的子女。我们扶养孩子们长大是为了和平的劳动。我们的孩子从小就看到苏联人民如何为苏维埃祖国的福利而忠实地劳动着。他们看到，在社会主义国家里，没有被压迫者和压迫者。这里最尊贵的就是为全苏维埃人民建立和平与幸福生活的劳动。
    在家庭里，在学校中，在儿童及青年的社会团体里，我们教导孩子们无限地去热爱自己的祖国，灌输他们对一切爱好和平的人民的尊重和友谊，及对奴役人者的鄙视和仇恨。
    在我国，儿童的面前广阔地开辟了一切知识、科学和艺术的大道及充分发展他们创造力和能力的道路。我的女儿卓娅，酷爱俄国历史和文学。我们英勇的过去，苏联人民的力量和光荣，以及人类高尚的纯洁和道德的模范曾使她着迷，她所爱的作家是普希金、白林斯基、涅克拉索夫、托尔斯泰、高尔基、马雅科夫斯基。我的女儿有聪明的头脑和一颗火热而勇敢的战士底心。
    当法西斯侵略者背信弃义地进攻我们和平的国家时，我们的青年就站在战士的最前列去拯救我们的国家。同时也是去拯救全人类！
    一九四一年，我的卓娅十八岁了。在这青年有为的时候，在事业的开端，她理想着幸福，理想着爱，理想着将如何更多更有效地为自己所酷爱的祖国的福利而劳动。可是她的理想却没有实现，法西斯匪帮侵入了我们和平的国家。莫斯科十月战斗开始以后，卓娅对我说：
    “妈妈！我要上前线去参加游击队。妈妈！你知道法西斯威胁着莫斯科，我再也不能袖手旁观了。我将以和法西斯主义者斗争而自豪。你也应以我上前线而自豪。只是不要含着眼泪去送我！”
    离别的时候，卓娅对我说：“我要做个英雄回来见你，不然就做个英雄死掉。然而妈妈，你不要悲哀。”接着她便微笑了一下，我们几百万的孩子们，都是这样怀着对胜利深深的信心，走上了保卫自己的祖国的火线。
    卓娅和一伙游击队通过了战线，到敌人占领的阵地去。经受了巨大的贫乏和困难与敌人搏斗。一九四一年十一月底，卓娅立了最后一次的战绩。卓娅潜入了法西斯所占领的彼得里雪伏村，在她执行任务的时候，她被德国兵捉住了。法西斯刽子手们折磨了我的女儿，他们用尽一切方法来拷问她；用皮鞭毒打，用枪托敲撞，驱使她脱了衣服在严寒里行走。冷血的杀人凶手和刽子手把她在绞架上颈上套着绳套的情景照下了相片，引以为乐，然而我的卓娅爱自己的人民，她是祖国忠实的女儿，又坚决，又刚毅。她以鄙视的态度来回答刽子手的拷问。临死的时候，他对聚集在绞架周围的农民们说：“同志们！我不怕死。为自己的人民而死，是很荣幸的。”
    卓娅向着法西斯士兵高叫：“现在你把我吊死，但我并不是一个人，我们有二万万人，你不能把他们都吊死，他们一定会替我复仇的！不论怎样，胜利是属于我们的！”
    当刽子手拉紧了绳套，扼住了卓娅的喉咙时，她用两手挤着绳套，稍松了松，用尽全力高喊道：“同志们告别了，奋斗吧！不要怕，斯大林跟我们在一起，斯大林一定会来的！”口念斯大林的名字，怀着胜利的信心，我的女儿就这样死去了。
    法西斯主义者杀死了我的女儿，但是她光辉的名字传遍整个苏联和全世界，她的名字成了一切先进的人类的英雄事业和神勇的象征。几百万男女青年响应了她死前的斗争号召。
    我最小的十七岁的儿子阿力山大也上了前线，去捍卫祖国，消灭敌人，为卓娅复仇。他说：“我爱我的祖国并不亚于卓娅。”我祝福我的儿子说：“希望你象卓娅一样。”
    我的儿子就和那个把卓娅处死的部队打仗，他是近卫军的上尉，自动炮的指挥员。他与军人们一起从格撒茨克到东普鲁士，在歌尼斯堡的激烈争夺战中，我的儿子英勇地牺牲了！我把他的遗体载回，安葬在故乡——莫斯科，与卓娅的墓并列。卓娅的墓上的黑色大理石的纪念碑上刻着字：“一个人最珍贵的东西就是生命，每一个人只赋有一个生命，应该让它这样的活下去——使她的死的时候能够说：一切生命和力量都贡献给世界上最美好的事业——为人类解放而斗争。”
    法西斯主义者夺去了我的孩子们，我的损失是重大的，但不只是我一个人，我们有很多，有很多母亲们为了自己可爱的祖国的自由，为了人类的自由而牺牲了自己的孩子。
    苏联人民永远歌颂那些在与法西斯浴血战争中不惜牺牲自己生命的几百万苏联人的不朽功勋。
    现在，充满着和平建设的劳动的我国，正在胜利地医治战争严重的创伤。我们的国家愿意全世界有巩固的正义的和平。
    为纪念我的卓娅，常有男女青年们来访问我，他们告诉我他们的进步，和我交换自己的理想和计划。我望着他们年青的脸，听着他们愉快的笑声，对他们的未来的一种恐吓的感觉忽向我袭来。和平的敌人们计谋着新的战争，帝国主义之间正缔结着军事同盟，开大炮、准备炮弹、原子弹、重新来杀人放火，使和平的人们变成残废。
    侵略者首先准备以自己的军事力量对付和平堡垒苏联，然而帝国主义者所准备的战争并非只是反苏的，而且将侵犯到每一个和平的策源地。战争在全世界破坏了千百个和平的家庭，牺牲、毁灭了几百万人的生命。
    为和平而斗争的战友们，我问你们：难道我们的孩子们的血是白白的流了吗？难道为我们的孩子们可贵的生命，母亲们及孤儿寡妇珍贵的眼泪所取得的和平，将被这一小撮帝国主义者所破坏吗？不，我们决不让他们这样做！我们从地球每一个角落来这里集会，为的是揭发战争贩子，向他们提出严重的警告。我们千百万的人，在我们的斗争中如果都能团结一致，坚定不移，那末任何力量都不能在我们团结一致的面前立足。
    当你们回国的时候，要将人类敌人罪恶滔天的阴谋告诉你们的人民，那时那些渴望着劳动及和平的平凡人所组成的一支新的大军将参加到我们争取和平的斗争战线上来。我们将会壮大到二倍、三倍。
    这里聚集了优秀的科学、艺术、文学的代表们，作家的字，画家的笔，学者的思想的反抗力是伟大的，请你们把这个武器用于争取和平的事业吧！以真正的民主精神及积极为和平而斗争的精神来教育青年的一代吧！
    在这一个讲坛上，我还请求全世界的父亲和母亲们将自己的孩子们教育成为爱好自由，争取和平的战士，那时他们才能保卫自己生存的权利，保卫自由和劳动。
    我相信，我知道：在争取和平的斗争中我们一定会胜利的。在争取我们的孩子们的生命、幸福及我们的未来的斗争中，任何力量都不能摧毁人民的意志。
