　　Liu Ningyi Reports on Attending the World Peace Congress and Returning to Beiping
　　Mao Zedong Thought Leads the Chinese People in the Struggle to Defend World Peace
　　[Our Paper's Report] Yesterday (the 20th) at 2 PM, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Women’s Federation for Democracy, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Students’ Federation, and the North China Workers’ Delegation, a total of six organizations, gathered at Peking University's Fourth Courtyard to listen to a report by Comrade Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, who recently returned from attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The report covered the Chinese People's Liberation War and World Peace, including the impact of the Chinese People's Liberation War on the world, and the solidarity of the world's proletariat. Comrade Liu Ningyi used comparisons to illustrate the changes in the strength of the world's two major camps since World War II. One is the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, the defender of world human peace, which is more united and more consolidated. It now has the World Federation of Trade Unions, a mass organization of the world's proletariat against imperialists, composed of more than sixty countries. The other is the reactionary camp headed by U.S. imperialism, where unemployment among workers in various countries is increasing day by day, and the crisis is becoming more and more serious. When he talked about the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, he said that people all over the world were cheering for this victory, which was a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. People all over the world are paying attention to the various policies formulated by Chairman Mao, because he led the Chinese people in the actual struggle to defend world peace. Mao Zedong Thought is a part of the further development of Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has seriously struck at the common enemy of the people of the world - imperialism. The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the whole world. (The full text of Comrade Ningyi's report will be published in tomorrow's newspaper.)
　　It is reported that the North China Workers’ Delegation will leave Beiping today (the 21st) to return to their work posts.

　　出席和大后归国返平
  　刘宁一同志昨作报告
    毛泽东思想领导中国人民  进行了保卫世界和平斗争
    【本报讯】昨（二十）日下午二时，中华全国总工会、全国民主青年联合会、全国民主妇女联合会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、全国学生联合会、华北职工代表团等六个单位在北大四院集会，听取最近出席拥护世界和平大会返国代表中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一同志的报告。报告的内容是：中国人民解放战争和世界和平，包括中国人民解放战争在全世界起了什么影响，和全世界无产阶级团结等问题。刘宁一同志用对比的方式说明了第二次世界大战以后，世界两大阵营力量的变化。一个是以世界人类和平的保卫者——苏联为首的民主阵营，是更加团结了，更加巩固了，现在已经有了六十多个国家组成的反对帝国主义者的世界无产阶级群众性组织——世界工会联合会；另一个是以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营的各国，失业工人一天比一天多，危机越来越严重。他谈到中国人民解放战争的胜利时说，全世界人民都为了这个胜利而欢欣鼓舞，这是毛主席思想的胜利。毛主席所规定的各种政策世界人民都注意着，因为他领导中国人民进行了实际的保卫世界和平的斗争。毛泽东思想是马列主义向前发展的一部分。中国人民解放战争的胜利严重地打击了全世界人民共同的敌人——帝国主义。中国人民的胜利就是全世界的胜利。（宁一同志报告全文见明日本报）
    闻华北职工代表团将于今（二十一）日离平，返回自己的工作岗位。
