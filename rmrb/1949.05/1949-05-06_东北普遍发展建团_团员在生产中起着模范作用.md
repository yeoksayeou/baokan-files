    东北普遍发展建团
    团员在生产中起着模范作用
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北新民主主义青年团自去年八月开始有重点地建团以来，现已得到普遍的发展。据不完全统计，东北已有团员三万八千多名，分布在一百四十八个县、市的各工厂、矿山、铁路、学校、机关团体中。青年团在青年工人中的工作有显著的成绩。新民主主义青年团的东北团校曾派遣三百多名毕业生到各城市工厂、矿山、铁路、军工等部门进行建团工作。哈尔滨市去年十二月中旬统计，已在一百一十个工厂的青年工人中发展了团员二千三百多名。青年团员在生产中一般都能起模范作用。自从今年二月各省市中共青委书记举行会议，确定以加强马列主义思想教育，继续发展和巩固青年团组织的方针后，各地青年团均作出了加强今后工作的计划。嫩江省决定在党校设立青年训练班，计划在今年内分期训练五百个青年工作干部。黑龙江、嫩江、合江等省农民亦已开始建团的试检工作。各地出版的青年刊物已有十余种，均受到青年欢迎。
