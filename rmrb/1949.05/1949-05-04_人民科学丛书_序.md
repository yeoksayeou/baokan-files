    Preface to "People's Science Series"
    Guo Moruo
    The general public's understanding of science seems to be both incorrect and superficial.

    One of the most common views is something like this: science is the business of scientists and has nothing to do with the general public. This is naturally ridiculously superficial.

    Another view is that science is material civilization and has nothing to do with spiritual civilization. Science is indispensable for better material enjoyment or for making the country rich and the military strong, but in the spiritual life of individuals and nations, science is useless. Seriously speaking, this is also ridiculously superficial.

    Science today is our way of thinking, our way of life, and the highest stage to which human spirit has developed. All life that has not undergone the baptism of science is an unreasonable existence and should be eliminated as soon as possible.

    Of course, science is not the ultimate goal, but the best tool for utilizing resources to enrich people's lives. The ultimate goal of human life is to enable all humanity to live more rationally and happily, and the application of science should be suitable for this goal. In a word, the spirit of true science and scientists is to serve the people.

    However, it is being misused. Although science has flourished with the development of capitalism, it has been misused in capitalist countries to serve a minority, that is, to serve a few monopoly capitalists; thus, the science of living people has become the science of killing people. In today's division of science, such a division has indeed arisen.

    Today we need true science, to restore science to its original position of serving the people, and to make it an unadulterated people's science. Today, the science and scientists of the Soviet Union are moving in this direction. We are willing to learn from them. The selection and translation of this "People's Science Series" here is not only to popularize scientific knowledge, but also to popularize the scientific spirit. Not only should ordinary readers find food here, but even specialized scientists should receive a re-education here.

    “人民科学丛书”序
    郭沫若
    一般人对于科学的了解，似乎都不大正确而且肤浅。
    有一种最普通的见解可以说就是这样的：科学是科学家的事，与一般人没有什么关系。这自然是肤浅的可笑。
    其次是科学是物质文明，与精神文明无关。要使物质享受好些或者要使得国富兵强，那是离不了科学，但在个人和民族的精神生活上，科学是不济事的。认真说，这也一样是肤浅得可笑。
    科学在今天是我们的思维方式，也是我们的生活方式，是我们人类精神所发展到的最高阶段。一切的生活没有经过科学的洗礼都是不合理的存在，那是应该让它早早消灭的。
    当然，科学也并不是究竟，而是利用厚生的最优良的工具。人类生活的究竟目标是在使全体人类能够生活得更合理，更幸福，科学的应用正应该适合于这种目标。真正的科学和科学家的精神，一句话归总，就是在为人民服务。
    然而是被人恶用了。科学虽然随资本主义的发达而昌明，但被资本主义的  国度恶用于为少数人服务，即为少数独占资本家服务；因而活人的科学便成为杀人的科学。在今天科学的分野里确实是起了这样的分化的。
    我们今天需要真正的科学，要使科学回复得到为人民服务的本位上来，使它成为不折不扣的人民科学。今天苏联的科学和科学家所走的正是这个方向。我们愿意向他们看齐。在这儿选译了这套“人民科学丛书”，不仅要使科学知识大众化，而且要使科学精神大众化。不仅普通的读者应该在这儿找寻粮食，就是专门的科学家也应该在这儿受一番再教育。
