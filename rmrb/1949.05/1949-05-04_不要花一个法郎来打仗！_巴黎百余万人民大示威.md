Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS reports: Over a million people in Paris participated in a five-hour long "May Day" demonstration and parade. Prior to "May Day," the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), and many local unions affiliated with "Workers' Force" reached an agreement to act in unison. At 3:00 PM on the 1st, the entire working class of Paris gathered at the Place de la Nation, organized into nine columns, carrying banners and flags, and singing songs as they marched towards the Place de la Bastille. The leaders of the CGT and the Paris Regional Union Federation, led by CGT General Secretary Frachon and Paris Regional Union Federation Secretary Mingot, formed the first line of the parade. A workers' band played music for them, and tens of thousands of people cheered them along the way. Next were the members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, led by Joliot-Curie and Aragon, who also received excited cheers and salutes. Members of the French Communist Party (PCF) Central Committee, led by Duclos, Gasan, Marty, Vermersch, and Guyot, marched behind the Standing Committee, and the crowd cheered, "Long live the French Communist Party!" "Long live Duclos!" "Long live Gasan!" "Long live Marty!" Cheers erupted again as members of the Veterans of the Struggle for Peace and Freedom Society and members of the France-Soviet Union Association, the France-Romania Association, the France-Poland Association, the France-Hungary Association, and other organizations passed by.

    At the Place de la Bastille, as members of the CGT Central Bureau, the Paris Union Federation, the Standing Committee of the Peace Congress, the PCF Central Committee, leaders of the Unified Socialist Party, and members of the Veterans of the Struggle for Peace and Freedom Society ascended the reviewing stand, a vast sea of metalworkers, steelworkers, construction workers, chemical workers, aviation industry workers, and members of the Resistance Movement, the French Women's Union, the French Republican Youth Union, and many other democratic organizations marched before the stand.

    The banners of the Resistance Movement members read: "Members of yesterday's Resistance Movement consider themselves today's fighters for peace and democracy!" Members of the French Republican Youth Union shouted to the Communist Party leaders: "French youth will never fight against the Soviet Union. Strengthen the unity to defend peace!" "Give peace to Vietnam!"

    The demonstrators from aviation, metallurgical factories, and construction worker groups sang: "The Atlantic Pact is a war pact; we want to work for peace, not for war!" The cry was immediately echoed: "Spend billions of francs on educating the youth, don't spend a single franc on war!"

    在巴斯底广场，总工会中央局委员、巴黎工会联合会委员、和平大会常设委员会委员、法共中央委员会委员、单一社会党领导人及争取和平自由战士社的委员登上检阅台时，一望无际的金属工人，钢铁工人、建筑工人、化学工人、航空工业工人及抵抗运动、法国妇女联盟、法国共和青年联盟及其他许多民主团体的会员的巨流，就在台前行进。
    抵抗运动会员们的标语写着：“昨天的抵抗运动的会员认为他们自己今天是争和平与民主的战士！”法国共和青年联盟的会员向共产党领袖高呼：“法国青年决不对苏联作战。加强保卫和平的团结！”“给越南和平！”
    航空、冶金工厂及建筑工人团体的示威群众高唱：“大西洋公约是战争公约，我们要为和平者不是为战争工作！”呼声立刻得到反响：“花几十亿的法郎来教育青年，不要花一个法郎来打仗！”。
