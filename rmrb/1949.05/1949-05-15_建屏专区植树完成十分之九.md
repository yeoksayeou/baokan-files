Jianping Special District Completes Nine-Tenths of Afforestation
[Chahar News] The Jianping Special District requires the planting of 2.5 million trees throughout the year's three seasons. Currently, the entire special district has planted 2,348,492 trees in the spring, completing over 90% of the annual afforestation task. Among them, Xingtang was required to plant 500,000 trees throughout the year, and 600,000 trees were planted in the spring, exceeding the annual plan. Fuping, Lingshou, and Jingxing counties also exceeded their annual plans in spring afforestation. The afforestation plans of these counties have been revised. Xingtang has revised its plan to one million trees, and it is expected that this year's afforestation will exceed the annual plan. The reasons for achieving these results are: (1) Early deployment gave the masses sufficient time for organization, deliberation, and preparation; (2) In-depth propaganda and mobilization inspired the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation and provided specific organizational leadership; (3) The masses formulated forest protection covenants, dealt with saboteurs in a timely manner, and strengthened the protection and management of forests; (4) Branch party members and cadres and active afforestation participants played exemplary roles, influencing and driving the general public to complete the plan; (5) Solving the difficulty of tree saplings, organizing tree saplings, labor, and land to cooperate in afforestation through shareholding, distributing trees according to shares, and establishing tree sapling markets with emphasis, mobilizing the masses to buy and sell on the market, which has been very effective. At the same time, according to different regions, a concentrated period was determined according to the season, concentrating all forces, going deep into the masses, and leading group by group to prevent spontaneous flow. The special district summarized the experience of spring afforestation work and pointed out that in the future, in addition to vigorously organizing and leading afforestation in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, attention should be paid to strengthening the management and protection of forests at all times, universally formulating forest protection covenants through the masses, and dealing with saboteurs in a timely manner to protect the obtained afforestation results, so as to dispel the masses' ideological concerns about not being able to protect the trees they have planted, and further inspire the enthusiasm for afforestation in the coming summer and autumn seasons to complete the afforestation task.

    建屏专区植树完成十分之九
    【察哈尔讯】建屏专区全年三季要求植树二百五十万棵，现全专区春季植树二三四八四九二棵，完成全年植树任务百分之九十以上，其中行唐要求全年植树五○万棵，春季就植树六○万棵，超过全年计划，阜平、灵寿、井陉三县春季植树亦均超过全年计划，这些县的植树计划已作修正。行唐已改订为一百万棵，预计今年植树将超过全年计划，获得这些成绩原因在于：（一）布置早使群众有充分组织酝酿准备时间，（二）深入宣传动员，启发群众的植树积极性，并具体组织领导。（三）通过群众制定护林公约，及时处理破坏分子，加强林木的保护管理。（四）发动支部党员干部与植树积极分子起模范带头作用，影响带动一般群众，完成计划。（五）解决树秧困难，组织树秧、劳力、土地入股合作造林，按股分树，有重点的设立树秧市，发动群众上市买卖，收效很大。同时按不同地区根据季节确定突击期，集中一切力量，深入群众组组领导，防止自流。专区总结了春季植树工作的经验并指出今后除在春夏秋三季大力组织领导植树外，应随时注意加强林木的管理与保护，普遍的通过群众制定护林公约，及时处理破坏分子，保护已得的植树成果，以解除群众怕植了树保护不住的思想顾虑，进一步启发今后夏秋两季植树积极性，完成植树任务。
