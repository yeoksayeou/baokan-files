    Comrade Togliatti once said: "Defending the unity of the labor movement should be like defending our own eyes!" In Italy, nationwide strikes erupted on October 14th and December 12th of last year. After Italian police shot and injured dozens of paper mill workers on February 17th of this year, workers, peasants, and universities across the country went on strike in protest. Since then, strikes have broken out one after another across the country. All of these struggles have been carried out under the leadership of the Italian General Confederation of Labor. Workers, closely united under Togliatti's call, defeated the divisive conspiracy of the Saragat group, and this time they overcame the stubborn resistance of the employers and won the victory of the strike.

    保卫劳工运动的统一！
    托格里亚蒂同志曾说过：“保卫劳工运动的统一，应象保卫我们的眼珠一样！”意大利在去年十月十四日，十二月十二日均曾爆发过全国规模的大罢工，今年二月十七日意警察枪伤造纸厂工人数十名后，全国各地工农大学罢工抗议，此后罢工运动即此起彼落遍及全国，所有这些斗争，均在意全国总工会的领导之下进行。工人紧密地团结在托格里亚蒂的号召下击败了萨拉盖特集团的分裂阴谋，这一次又压服了雇主的顽固反抗，争得了罢工的胜利。
