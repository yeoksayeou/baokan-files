　　“Siam” Changed to “Thailand” Again
  　Fascist Luang Phibuns's Delusions of Grandeur and Desire for Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 14th] Bangkok dispatch: Siamese fascist ringleader Luang Phibuns announced on the 11th the renaming of Siam to Thailand once again. The name Thailand is an extremely aggressive and conceited title used by Siamese fascists. According to the fascists, Siam's neighboring regions, including the minority nationalities within China's Hainan Island, Yunnan, and Sichuan, are supposedly all so-called "Thai" people. Luang Phibuns first changed Siam's national name to Thailand in 1939, on the eve of the outbreak of World War II. At that time, Luang Phibuns vigorously implemented fascist terror rule, frantically excluding overseas Chinese, referring to them as so-called "Oriental Jews." After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Siamese rulers temporarily retracted the name Thailand. After Luang Phibuns regained power, he has now adopted the name Thailand again. This shows that, encouraged by the aggressive policies of American and British imperialists, the Siamese fascists are reliving their old dream of "Greater Thai chauvinism."

　　“暹罗”又改“泰国”
  　法西斯分子銮披汶妄自尊大还想侵略
    【新华社北平十四日电】曼谷讯：暹罗法西斯头子銮披汶于十一日宣布再一次把暹罗改称为泰国。按泰国的名称是暹罗法西斯分子极具侵略性的妄自尊大的称号。照法西斯分子的说法，暹罗的邻近地区，包括中国海南岛、云南、四川境内的少数民族，据说都是所谓“泰”族。銮披汶第一次更换暹罗国号为泰国是在一九三九年第二次大战爆发前夕。当时，銮披汶厉行法西斯恐怖统治，疯狂地排斥华侨，指华侨为所谓“东方犹太人”。一九四五年日寇投降后，暹罗统治者曾一度把泰国的名称收起。銮披汶重掌政权以后，现在又采用了泰国的名称。这表明暹罗法西斯分子在美英帝国主义者侵略政策的鼓励下，正在重温其“大泰族主义”的旧梦。
