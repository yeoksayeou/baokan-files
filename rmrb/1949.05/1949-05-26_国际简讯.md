Rome Dispatch: Municipal elections will be held in the British-American occupied zone of the Free Territory of Trieste. Elections in the city of Trieste will be held on June 12th, and in the five municipalities including Muggia on June 19th. From the very beginning of the election campaign, representatives of the Communist Party and democratic organizations of the Free Territory of Trieste have been exposing, at mass meetings, the conditions created by the Anglo-American occupation authorities that make genuine elections impossible. The occupation authorities have been fully supporting fascist instigation groups, and incidents of persecution of progressive elements are constantly occurring. At the same time, in order to "maintain law and order" during the elections, the Anglo-American occupation authorities have prepared 17,000 police officers to use as armed intervention.
