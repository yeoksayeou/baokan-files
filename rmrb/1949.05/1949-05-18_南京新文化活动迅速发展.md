Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th. Since the liberation of Nanjing, new cultural activities have developed rapidly. On the first day of the opening of the Xinhua Bookstore Nanjing Branch, over 8,000 new books were sold. More than 5,000 workers, students, educators, civil servants, and citizens from all walks of life came to buy books. Mao Zedong's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of a Communist Party Member," and "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution" were sold out in less than half a day. People said that they had never seen such a book-buying craze in Nanjing. The Nanjing people's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, ranks first in circulation among all newspapers here. Every morning, more than 300 news vendors wait at the entrance of the newspaper office. Many readers use the Xinhua Daily as basic learning material. The posting places of the Xinhua Daily are crowded with people all day long. The cultural troupe of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has been continuously performing "The White Haired Girl" and "Blood and Tears of Hatred" in major cinemas and theaters in recent days, while the film team has been showing "Democratic Northeast," and the audience is extremely crowded. On the 10th, the cinema screened films for all the workers in the city free of charge. When the heroic deeds of Li Xueming, a worker at the Pukou Power Plant, in protecting the machines were shown on a slideshow, the workers were extremely moved. They said: "The Communist Party really does not bury good people!" The photo exhibition held by a certain unit was attended by tens of thousands of viewers in seven days. A worker wrote in the suggestion book: "I have excitedly seen the prospect of the new China." A teacher wrote: "After seeing the photos, my pessimistic thoughts have been eliminated. With the leadership of the Communist Party, what difficulties are we afraid of not being able to overcome!" Factories and schools are organizing drama troupes and singing teams one after another, and the Yangko dance has become the most popular form of entertainment for the broad masses.

　　南京新文化活动迅速发展
    【新华社南京十六日电】南京解放后，新文化活动已得到迅速的发展。新华书店南京分店开幕的第一天，即卖出新书八千余册，工人、学生、教育界、公务员及各界市民前往购书者在五千人以上。毛泽东著“目前形势和我们的任务”、刘少奇著“论共产党员的修养”及“关于修改党章的报告”等书，不到半天即抢购一空。人们都说，在南京从来没有见过这样的购书热潮。南京人民的报纸——新华日报属此间各报发行数的第一位。每天早晨都有三百余报贩等候在报社的门庭。许多读者以新华日报作为学习的基本材料。新华日报的张贴处，整天围满着人群。解放军某部的文工团，连日来在各大电影院、戏院连续演出“白毛女”、“血泪仇”，电影队则放映“民主东北”，观众极为拥挤。十日，电影院为全市工人免费放映。当用幻灯放映浦口电厂工人李学明保护机器的英勇事迹时，工人们极为感动，他们说：“共产党真不埋没好人！”某部举办的照片展览，前后七天，观众达数万人。一位工人在意见簿上写道：“我已兴奋地看到了新中国的远景。”一位教师写道：“看了照片，消除了我的厌世思想。中国有了共产党的领导，还怕什么困难不能克服！”各工厂、学校正纷纷组织剧团、歌咏队，秧歌舞已成为广大群众最喜爱的娱乐方式。
