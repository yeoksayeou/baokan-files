[Jinan Telegraph] Under the leadership and assistance of the democratic government, farmers in various parts of southern Hebei are vigorously irrigating and hoeing wheat to strive for a bumper summer harvest this year. In the three special districts along the Fuyang River, counties such as Chengci, Handan, Yongnian, and Jize have planned to open 140 li of canals, irrigating 80,000 mu of land, of which wheat fields account for two-thirds, and it is estimated that production can be increased by more than 57,000 shi. The Matou Sluice in Chengci originally irrigated more than 53,000 mu of land, and then dredged 60 li of canals, expanding the paddy fields by more than 10,000 mu. In Suli, Handan, the paddy fields have also been expanded from 30,000 mu to 42,000 mu, so that all wheat seedlings near the river have been irrigated for the first time. Now they are actively irrigating for the second time. Farmers have reflected that "digging a good canal is better than digging a thousand wells." In areas far from the river, the sound of waterwheels and windlasses continues day and night. In Renxian County, in order to prevent drought and irrigate wheat, 104 waterwheels were built in 13 villages, including Datun and Mafang in the Fourth District. In the first district of Longyao, many village farmers save money on food and clothing to buy waterwheels. Xidong Village bought seven waterwheels in a row, and three families ate chaff and vegetables because of this, but they did not feel bitter. Looking at the green wheat seedlings, they happily said, "It doesn't matter if it's hard now. If we harvest two more dou of wheat, we can earn back the price of the waterwheel, and we can still eat white flour!" In addition, wheat hoeing has been universally carried out in both paddy fields and dry land. Linzhang, Chengci, and other counties started the earliest, and now they have hoeed over the first time, and many villages are hoeing the second and third times. In Qinghe County (where there is a lot of sandy soil), where farmers are not used to hoeing wheat, district and village cadres use the benefits of hoeing wheat and reaping more in the past year to break the conservative thinking of farmers and universally hoe wheat. A large number of women actively participated in wheat hoeing, which is a new phenomenon that has never happened in previous years. In Xigaocun, Yuanchao, women participating in wheat hoeing account for more than 60%, and they go out early and return late in teams every day, showing the productive power of women. As a result, the social contempt for them has been eliminated. When women in Linzhang and other counties first went to the fields, some were afraid of being laughed at, and some were in low spirits because they could not hoe. Later, they gathered together, with more people and more courage, broke through the feudal advice behind them, and it was also convenient to learn from each other, and the number of participants gradually increased.

　　水车辘轳昼夜不停
  　冀南各地防旱浇麦
    【冀南电】冀南各地农民在民主政府的领导与扶助下，大力浇麦锄麦，争取今年夏季丰收。三专区沿滏阳河成磁、邯郸、永年、鸡泽等县，有计划的开渠达一百四十里，浇地八万亩，内麦田占三分之二，估计可增产五万七千余石。成磁马头闸原浇地五万三千多亩，后又浚渠六十里，扩大水田万余亩。邯郸苏里，亦由三万亩水田扩大至四万二千亩，使所有靠河麦苗均浇完头水，现正积极浇二水，农民纷纷反映说：“开好一道渠，顶修千眼井”。距河较远的地区，水车和辘轳声，昼夜不断，任县为防旱浇麦，四区大屯、马房等十三村即修起水车一百零四辆。隆尧一区不少村农民，节衣缩食，购买水车。西董村一连买了七辆水车，有三家因此搀糠吃菜而不觉苦，他们看着绿油油的麦苗欢喜的说：“现在苦些没啥，麦子多收二斗，就能赶回水车价，还能吃白面！”另外，水田和旱田均普遍展开锄麦，临漳、成磁等县下手最早，现在已锄过头遍，不少村正锄二遍、三遍。锄麦不习惯的清河县（沙硷地多）、区、村干部以去年锄麦多收的好处，打破农民保守思想，普遍锄麦。锄麦中大批妇女踊跃参加，这是历年未有的新气象。元朝西高庄参加锄麦的妇女占百分之六十以上，每天成队早出晚归，显示了妇女的生产力量。因而消除了社会上对她们的轻视。临漳等县妇女开始下地时有的怕人笑话，有的不会锄而情绪低落，后来她们串到一块，人多胆壮，冲破了背后的封建议论，又便于互相学习，参加人数逐渐增多。
