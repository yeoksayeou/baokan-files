    Anyang Registers Enemy and Puppet Personnel
    Military Control Commission Commends Entering Troops
    [Taihang Electric] After the liberation of Anyang City, on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, the Military Control Commission, in addition to rewarding railway workers who had contributed to protecting equipment, also held meetings with workers, students, citizens, and teachers respectively, to explain the Party's various policies. It also called for a swift resumption of work, classes, and businesses. Regarding the registration of enemy and puppet personnel, according to incomplete statistics, over 1,300 people have registered, including the section chief of the puppet Third Special District Office, the puppet Anyang County Magistrate, and officers down to the rank of company commander. Currently, our People's Bank, as well as the industrial, commercial, and postal departments have begun operations, and all primary and secondary schools formally resumed classes on the 9th. Most shops have reopened for business.
    Furthermore, the troops ordered to enter the city, from cadres and soldiers to staff members, have consistently and correctly implemented the city's policies, strictly adhered to city discipline, and truly lived up to the higher authorities' call to "protect everything, leave it untouched, not take a single needle or thread from the masses, and not borrow things indiscriminately." Not a single person picked up even scattered items abandoned by the enemy to take as their own. One company, after entering the city gate, had no firewood, so they traveled over ten miles the next day to gather firewood. The Military Control Commission has issued a circular to commend them.

    安阳办理敌伪人员登记
    军管会表扬入城部队
    【太行电】安阳市解放后七、八、九三日，军管会除奖励保护器材有功的铁路工人外，并分别召开了工人、学生、市民、教员会议，进行党的各种政策的讲解。并号召迅速复工、复课、复业。办理敌伪人员登记工作，据不完全统计，登记者已有伪三专署科长、伪安阳县长及营长以下一千三百余名。现我人民银行及工商邮务部门已开始办公，各中小学校也均于九日正式复课。大部商店已开张营业。
    又：奉命入城部队，从干部、战士到事务人员，始终正确的执行了城市政策，严格遵守城市纪律，真正做到了上级“保护起来，原封不动，不拿群众一针一线，不乱借东西”的号召，连敌人遗弃下来的零星物品也没有一个人去拾为私有。某连进入城关后没柴火，第二天跑了十几里路去打柴。军管会特予通报表扬。
