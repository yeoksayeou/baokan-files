　　On the Soviet Union's Contribution to the Anti-Fascist War
　　Readers of this newspaper, Mr. Cao Ren, Mr. Li Jingjun, and Mr. Song Ziqing, have successively raised several questions about the Soviet Union's contribution to the Anti-Fascist War. Due to the distorted propaganda of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, many people in our country do not understand the truth about these issues. We now provide a brief reply as follows.
　　Editor

　　(1) The "Lend-Lease Act" and the Soviet-German War:
　　The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. When it was subjected to a sudden attack by Germany, it suffered great losses, especially in industry. However, precisely because the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country, the Soviet people, for the sake of their motherland and for human peace, fought bravely under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the great leader Stalin. Only a year later, their war industry recovered and developed even further. During the four years of the Soviet-German War, the Allied countries of Britain and the United States supplied the Soviet Union with nearly 10,000 tanks, almost as many artillery pieces and aircraft. However, from the second year of the war, the Soviet Union itself produced an average of more than 30,000 tanks, self-propelled guns, and armored vehicles, 40,000 aircraft, 120,000 artillery pieces, and 100,000 mortars annually. The main weapons supplied to the Soviet Union by the Allied countries of the United States and Britain accounted for only 5% to 6% of the total Soviet weapons production. Moreover, the quality of Soviet weapons themselves surpassed those of Germany and the United States. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet people defeated the enemy with their own manufactured weapons and the heroic spirit of the people of the socialist countries, and not, as the provocateurs claim, by relying on the American "Lend-Lease Act" to achieve victory in the war against Germany.

　　(2) The Impact of the Opening of the Second Front on the Soviet-German Front:
　　When the Battle of Stalingrad began, the Soviet Union was fighting alone against 240 divisions of German troops and their vassal states. At the same time, only four German divisions and eleven Italian divisions were fighting in Libya, while the remaining 73 German divisions were performing defensive duties in the occupied countries (France, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia). In November 1943, in the first three months of the Soviet Union's counter-offensive in Stalingrad, it defeated 112 divisions of Hitler's German army, destroying and capturing 7,000 German tanks, 4,000 aircraft, and 17,000 artillery pieces. At this time, there was no Second Front. The war waged by the Allies in North Africa did not cause Hitler to transfer a single soldier from the Soviet-German front. The Soviet Union was fighting almost the entire German Nazi war machine.
　　The Soviet Union hoped that the opening of the Second Front would shorten the war, but the Allied countries consistently adopted a passive and dilatory attitude towards the opening of the Second Front. Until November 1943, Hitler was still using "total" mobilization and "super-total" mobilization to restore the size of his defense forces. Therefore, the number of Hitler's troops on the Soviet-German front had increased to as many as 257 divisions, of which 207 divisions were German divisions. The Soviet army broke through the encirclement of Leningrad in the famous Orel-Kursk battle and defeated the German army. Subsequently, it continuously annihilated German troops on the Mius River, in Korsun and Rokossovsky in Ukraine, and liberated Kiev and other Soviet cities. We know that at this time, the Second Front in Europe was still only in the planning stage. When the Allies were slow to open the Second Front, Stalin said: "The strength of the Soviet Union to resist the German robbers, in terms of intensity, is no less than that of fascist Germany or any other force that wants to invade and gain world hegemony, if not greater."
　　In June and July 1944, the Soviet army encircled and annihilated the German Central Army Group in Belarus, rapidly approaching the Carpathian Mountains and about to liberate Romania and Bulgaria. The Second Front on the map of France was still only a faint red arc.
　　In December 1944, Hitler launched an offensive in the Ardennes region on the Second Front, threatening the entire US-British army. The German army planned to use the Dunkirk tactics once again to render Britain incapable of fighting. In January 1945, when Churchill appealed to Stalin to relieve the serious threat to the US-British forces, the Soviet army had launched an offensive on a vast front from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains. The Soviet army began to break into Germany and quickly appeared in the suburbs of Berlin, which forced Hitler to transfer the Fifth and Sixth Panzer Armies, which were prepared for attacking the US-British forces, to the Eastern Front against the Soviet army, thereby saving the Second Front and the destruction of the US-British forces. Without the powerful offensive of the Soviet Union, without the Soviet army to contain and annihilate the main force of Germany, the US-British Allies could not have landed in Normandy or maintained their positions. This is the role that the opening of the Second Front played in the Soviet army's victory over Germany.

　　(3) Was it the American atomic bomb or the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan that decisively hastened Japan's collapse and surrender?
　　Defeating Japanese imperialism was originally a part of the victory of the entire anti-fascist war. After the Chinese people's anti-Japanese army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the arduous struggle of the entire Chinese people, laid the foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, on February 22, 1945, the Allied countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain held a meeting in Yalta in order to promptly urge the Japanese invaders to surrender. At that time, the Soviet Union decided to undertake "to assist the Allies in declaring war on Japan two or three months after Germany's surrender and the end of the European war" (see the full text of the Yalta Agreement, paragraph 1). The Soviet Union was faithful to the agreement it signed. Germany surrendered on May 9, and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, and began sending troops to northeast China on August 9 to attack the Japanese army. Although before the Soviet Union sent troops, the naval and air forces of the US-British Allies had already fought on the Pacific islands belonging to Japan in Asia, the Allies rapidly increased their combat power in Asia precisely as a result of the Soviet Union defeating the main force of fascism in Europe. The Allied offensive in the Pacific caused considerable losses to the Japanese naval and air forces, and the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6. However, all these efforts did not defeat the main invading force of Japan - the Japanese army. At that time, the Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China, which Japan claimed to be the elite of the army, totaled 560,000, the Japanese army in Korea totaled 360,000, and there were also 200,000 troops from the Japanese puppet state of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. These troops were all equipped with modern equipment.
　　At that time, Allied military experts believed that even if the US-British forces completely occupied the Japanese mainland and destroyed the Japanese navy and air force, Japan might still rely on its army to carry out long-term stubborn resistance in Northeast China. The Soviet Union participated in the war under these circumstances. Because it was faithful to the obligations it had undertaken, it fought bravely with the Japanese army and defeated all the Kwantung Army and puppet troops within ten days, thoroughly crushing the Japanese imperialists' plan to rely on the army and use the puppet state of Manchuria as a base for stubborn resistance. This decisively hastened Japan's collapse and surrender.

### 关于苏联在反法西斯战争中的贡献

专栏：时事问答

　　关于苏联在反法西斯战争中的贡献
    本报读者曹忍、李靖均、宋子清诸先生，先后提出关于苏联在反法西斯战争中的贡献的几个问题：由于美帝和国民党反动派的歪曲宣传，使得我国有许多人对这些问题，没有认识真相，现在我们简复如下。
　　编者
    　　　　　
　　（一）“租借法案”与苏德战争：
    苏联是一个爱好和平的国家，当她遭受到德国的突然袭击时，她蒙受到很大的损失，尤其在工业方面。但是，正因为苏联是一个爱好和平的国家，苏联人民为了自己的祖国，为了人类和平，在苏联共产党和伟大领袖斯大林领导之下英勇奋斗着，只是一年之后，她们的战争工业就恢复并更加发展起来。在苏德战争的四年中，英美盟国供给苏联的主要武器，有将近一万辆的坦克，差不多同样多的大炮和飞机。但是从战争第二年起，苏联自己每年平均要生产三万辆以上的坦克，自动炮和装甲汽车，四万架飞机，十二万门大炮，十万门迫击炮。美英盟国供给苏联的主要武器只是苏联武器生产总额的百分之五至百分之六。而且，苏联自己的武器在质量上也是超过了德国，超过了美国的。由此可知，苏联人民是用着自己的制造的武器和社会主义国家人民的英雄气概战胜了敌人的，绝不是挑拨者说的苏联是依靠美国的“租借法案”才取得了对德战争的胜利。
　　（二）第二战场之开辟对苏德战场的影响：
    斯大林格勒战役开始，苏联就单独抗击着德国军队及其附庸国军队二百四十个师；与此同时，只有四个德国师和十一个意大利师在利比亚作战，其余的七十三个德国师则在被占领国（法、比、挪、荷、南、波、捷）担任防守任务。一九四三年十一月，苏联在斯大林格勒开始反攻的头三个月就击溃了希特勒德国军队一百一十二师，击溃并俘虏德军坦克七千辆，飞机四千架，大炮一万七千门。这时，并没有第二战场，盟国在北非进行的战争，并没有使希特勒从苏德战场上调走一兵一卒。苏联几乎是面对着整个德国纳粹战争机构进行着战斗。
    苏联是希望着开辟第二战场以缩短战争的，但是盟国对第二战场的开辟，一直采取着消极怠工的态度。一九四三年十一月为止，希特勒还在用“总”动员和“超总”动员，恢复着他的国防军人数。因此苏德战场上的希特勒军队曾增加到二百五十七师之多，其中有二百零七个师是德国师。苏军在著名的奥勒尔--库尔斯克战役突破了列宁格勒的包围并击溃了德国兵国兰随后又在缪斯河，在乌克兰的科尔逊、洛科夫斯基连续地歼灭德国军队，解放基辅和其他苏联城市。我们知道，在这个时候，欧洲的第二战场还只是在计划中。当盟国迟迟不肯开辟第二战场时，斯大林就说过：“苏联抵抗德国强盗的力量，在强度方面，即使不比法西斯德国的或任何其他想侵略想取得世界霸权的力量来得大些，也决不来得小些”。
    一九四四年六、七月间，苏军在白俄罗斯包围并歼灭了中路德军，迅速地接近了喀尔巴阡山，马上就要解放罗马尼亚与保加利亚的时候，第二战场在法国的地图上，也还只是一条看不明显的红色弧线。
    一九四四年十二月，希特勒在第二战场上的亚尔丁地区发动了攻势，使整个美英军队遭到威胁。德军当时计划着再用一次敦克尔克的战法使英国失去战斗能力。一九四五年一月，邱吉尔向斯大林呼吁，要解救美英军队所受到的严重威胁时，苏军已在波罗的海至喀尔巴阡山辽阔的战线上展开攻势，苏军开始突入德国境内并迅速出现在柏林近郊，这就强迫希特勒把准备用之于进攻美英军队的第五第六两个坦克军调到东线苏军正面来，因而也就挽救了第二战场和美英军队的覆灭。没有苏联的强大攻势，没有苏军来牵制并歼灭德国的主力，美英盟国就不可能在诺曼第登陆或保持自己的阵地。这就是第二战场的开辟对苏军战胜德国所起的作用。 　 （三）决定地促使日本崩溃与投降的是美国的原子弹还是苏联的对日宣战？
    击败日本帝国主义，原是整个反法西斯战争胜利的一部份。中国共产党领导下的中国人民抗日军队，以及全中国人民的艰苦奋斗，奠定了抗日战争胜利的基础之后，一九四五年二月二十二日，苏美英盟国为了迅速促使日寇投降，三国领袖曾在雅尔塔举行会议。当时，苏联就决定承当“在德国投降后两三月及欧洲战争结束时，协助盟国对日宣战”（见雅尔塔协定全文第一段）。苏联是忠于他所签字的协定的，德国于五月九日投降，苏联于八月八日对日宣战，八月九日就开始出兵我国东北向日军进攻。虽然在苏联出兵以前，美英盟国的海空军已经在亚洲方面打上了日本所属太平洋岛屿，但是，盟国迅速地在亚洲增强作战力量，正是苏联在欧洲击败了法西斯主力军的结果。盟国在太平洋的进攻，使日本海空军受到相当的损失，美国并于八月六日在日本广岛投下原子弹，可是这一切努力，并没有击败日本的侵略主力--日本的陆军。当时，日本自称为陆军精锐的驻在东北一地的关东军共五十六万，在朝鲜的日军共三十六万，此外尚有日本傀儡满洲国及内蒙军二十万，这些军队都有着近代的装备。
    当时盟国的军事专家们都认为美英军队即使完全占领日本本土，摧毁日本的海军空军，日本还可能依恃其陆军，在我国东北实行长期顽抗。苏联在这种情况下参战了，由于他忠实于他所承担的义务，英勇地和日军作战，在十天之内就击败了全部关东军和伪军，彻底粉碎日本帝国主义依恃陆军，把伪满洲国作为顽抗基地的计划。这就决定地促成了日本的崩溃与投降。
