Introduction to the Work of the Tianjin Telecommunications Work Group

    Tianjin's telecommunications enterprises are divided into two major systems. One is the "Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau," which has seven branch bureaus, eighteen business locations, three transmitting and receiving stations, and telecommunications bureaus in Tanggu, Jinghai, and Duliu. It also includes the Tianjin Machine Station of the Beiping 7th District Administration Bureau, with a total of 1,758 employees. Including the Tianjin Machine Station of the Pingguan Bureau, the total is 2,002 employees. There are 17,000 telephones. Telegrams are available in both wired and wireless forms, reaching almost the entire country.

    The other is the "Central Electrical Equipment Factory," which has three branch factories, as well as the Central Radio Factory, Sino-American Wireless Electrical Equipment Company, Joint Logistics Repair Factory, and radio stations. It has over 1,300 employees. The main products are batteries, generators, transformers, electric wires, telephones, light bulbs, electric fans, and transmitting and receiving machines, and wireless radio assemblies.

    The two major systems, with fifty-three units, have a total of more than 3,300 employees. Most employees have a considerable level of education. Among the staff, there are many who studied abroad and university graduates. Most workers have at least a primary school education, and illiteracy is rare. The above is a general overview of Tianjin's telecommunications enterprises. Now, to better explain the work of the Tianjin Telecommunications Work Group, it is introduced separately below:

  (1) The Course of Work
    The Telecommunications Work Group has a total of thirty people, from six units (Party, Youth League, vocational school, municipal training class, urban work department), more than half of whom are comrades who originally worked in rural areas. Before entering the city, we made some preparations in terms of organization and ideology: such as the allocation of cadres, ideological mobilization, etc. We also formulated specific work steps and discussed the relationship between the military representative and the work group. Although these preparations were not perfect due to the short time, they have been of great help to the subsequent work.

    The takeover personnel and the work group made some preparations before entering the city. Therefore, four hours after the battle ended, the advance personnel arrived at the takeover units, and other personnel also arrived successively, going to various units to quickly carry out work. First, the military representative convened a meeting of all section chiefs and above of the Telecommunications Bureau at the Telecommunications Bureau (a general meeting of all employees was held at the Central Radio Factory), announced our policies, and ordered the original director to quickly resume work. Using the original organizational structure, it was quickly deployed. On the first day, 9,121 telephone users were restored, and on the second day, line workers set out to repair lines. The number of reported employees reached 80 percent (now all have reported).

  (2) Grasping the Ideological Trends of Active Elements
    The Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau had a strike before liberation, and more than thirty people were arrested. After liberation, the employees were excited, demanding to fight the puppet trade union special agents and running dogs, and to remove bad employees. Slogans such as "Settle Accounts with ××" were posted on the walls of the Telecommunications Bureau. The active elements of the previous strike were even more激烈, and those who had been in prison inevitably had some thoughts of revenge. Secondly, they demanded adjustments to wages, expansion of the medical clinic, reform of the old system, etc., and all problems were required to be solved quickly.

    The employees' ideological concerns were fear of layoffs, fear of joining the army, and fear of eating millet (the Kuomintang propaganda said that after the Communist Party came, they would eat millet and join the army), and the staff, in particular, feared the so-called "struggle" promoted by the Kuomintang.

    Due to the reactionary propaganda of the Kuomintang, the employees' political awareness was blocked, and some employees had confused ideas and orthodox concepts. But on the whole, left-leaning thought and impatience prevailed at that time.

    Based on the above ideological situation, a meeting of active elements was convened (including strike leaders, arrested employees, and the factory protection committee after we entered the city). First, they were mobilized to give opinions on the takeover work. Addressing some incorrect ideas, policies were announced, explaining the harm of adopting rural-style struggle methods, and repeated explanations were given. At the same time, they were comforted, expressing that we knew their contributions in safeguarding the interests of the workers and the persecution they had suffered.

    Then, specific work was assigned, guiding them to the Party's policies. Through them, our policies were conveyed to the employees.

    Grasping the active elements, especially correcting their ideological deviations, is a very important task. Generally speaking, they have prestige and a mass base. Using them to work is very effective. What they say is more believable to the workers. If you can grasp this group of active elements, the work is easier to advance, and major deviations will not occur.

  (3) Propaganda and Education Work
    In addition to using large and small meetings, and informal discussions to conduct class education and publicize policies, in order to raise awareness, stabilize emotions, and cultivate active elements, we first organized employees who could not resume work temporarily into study classes. About 400 people were organized into 21 groups, combining political study with technical study, with politics as the main focus. The old director was responsible for technical study, and five people were selected from the group leaders to form a study committee, responsible for all study matters. Those who had resumed work formed after-hours study groups, twice a week, for one hour each time.

    After the study class ended, two short-term study classes were established, with about 250 people in each class, each lasting seven days. People were invited to give large lectures and discussions.

    The content of these studies mainly included carrying the revolution through to the end, the resolutions of the Labor Congress, and On New Democracy.

    Except for the factory system, about two-thirds of the employees in the telecommunications bureau system have participated in the study.

    In addition, various meetings were used to educate and train cadres, and to call for active production, such as organizing the Pingjin celebration meeting, the New Year's get-together, and the "February 7th" memorial meeting. At the "February 7th" conference, all employees were called upon to repair the lines in a short period of time, proposing to make all city telephones work to commemorate "February 7th." The line workers immediately responded to the call, guaranteeing completion. The next day, Liu Huai and others from the Engineering Institute set out to help line workers repair the lines. The staff said, we don't know how to repair lines, but it is also useful to push the carts for the workers. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of the line workers. Using this to improve the workers' enthusiasm for labor to influence technicians and general staff to gradually change their thinking and style is one of the best ways to transform the old staff, and at the same time can reduce the workers' original anger towards the staff and enhance the unity of employees.

  (4) Employees Participate in Inventory Work
    Representatives elected by the worker masses participated in the inventory. In the beginning, the guiding ideology was not clear enough, and we dared not let go, fearing that ruffians and bad people would be mixed in. We even demanded that the work group provide an absolute guarantee before they could participate, so this work was not fully rolled out. But we strived to do it, which was to strengthen worker education on the one hand, and carefully elect employee representatives to participate on the other. The Central Radio Factory established an inventory committee, composed of military representatives, the work group, and employee representatives, divided into four groups to conduct inventory separately.

    As a result, the units where workers participated in the inventory discovered a lot of unreported items. For example, the Telecommunications Bureau warehouse had three reels of cable (about 200 meters) that were not reported, ten storage batteries were not reported, and the three bureaus had two and a half reels of cable (one reel) that were not reported. The inventory list wrote one foot of rubber wire, but 3,000 meters were found. In the inner room of a warehouse, there were more than 100 telephones and other materials that were not on the inventory list at all. There were also exchanges listed on the list, but other machines were used to replace them during the inventory. These problems were discovered under the coordination of the workers.

    At the same time, the workers' enthusiasm was also improved due to their participation in the inventory, feeling that they were truly the masters of the enterprise. They were very serious and responsible for the inventory, carefully checking even the dark corners, recording everything that did not match the inventory list, and reporting back to the employees who elected them.

    Facts have proved that in this takeover work, all departments where workers participated in the inventory not only inventoried a lot of things, but also mobilized the enthusiasm of the worker masses.

  (5) Establishment of the Employee Representative Congress
    When we started to organize the representative congress, we first drafted a draft, brewed it among the employees, and after making good preparations, we held a general meeting to mobilize them. First, we explained the difference between the representative congress and the puppet trade union, the significance and tasks of establishing the employee representative congress, what kind of people to elect, and how to elect them. Then, we announced that it would be divided according to administrative divisions, with one representative elected for every 30 people. If there were fewer than 15 people, they would be merged into other departments, and if there were more than 45 people, two people would be elected as representatives, and so on.

    After the meeting, they were allowed to discuss in groups, determine the conditions for representatives, and then begin the election. First, nominations were made, and then candidates were selected by secret ballot, followed by campaigning, anti-campaigning, and formal election. If a special agent or bad person was found to be elected during the election of candidates, he could be rejected in the anti-campaign. For example, in the Telecommunications Branch Bureau No. 2, a bad element invited twelve people to dinner before the election. As a result, he was elected as a candidate. We immediately mobilized the employees to collect materials about his bad deeds. During the anti-campaign, the employees presented evidence of his violation of the interests of the working class, and a vote was taken on the spot to revoke his candidacy.

    Representatives were first elected in units with many employees, and the experience gained here was extended to small units. Representative congresses were established successively in various units. More than 70 representatives were elected in the telecommunications system, and 17 standing representatives were elected according to the number of people to form the Standing Committee, with one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and four departments for organization, propaganda and education, production, and welfare. A secretariat and a cooperative were also established. After the establishment of the representative congress, it immediately took over the materials, archives, and cooperative of the puppet trade union, and took over the welfare committee with the administrative consent.

    Through these propaganda and education activities, and by solving some practical problems for the workers, such as exchanging gold yuan coupons, the workers' awareness and enthusiasm gradually increased, and they began to change their attitude towards labor. For example, workers at the Central Radio Factory donated many tools, and the work that used to require seven people at the Telecommunications Bureau line workers could now be completed by five people. The relationship between staff and workers has also improved. During this preparation for democratic reform and extensive solicitation of employee opinions, excessively high demands and excessively left-leaning ideas were reduced.

  (6) Appointing Comrades Who Previously Worked Underground
    The above work cannot be done solely by the work group. The main thing is to appoint underground comrades and mobilize the masses to do their own things.

    For the original underground comrades, it is necessary to strengthen policy education on the one hand, and boldly employ them on the other, cultivate their prestige, and do everything through them. For example, in the celebration of the Pingjin meeting, the get-together and other activities, we only grasp the principled issues, and the specific work is entrusted to the original underground comrades. They are familiar with the situation, have methods, and their abilities are generally not weaker than those of the work group comrades.

    In the past, the study classes had to be led by strong cadres from the work group. Now, the Telecommunications Bureau study class can contact teachers, organize groups, and form a study committee before the start of the study to discuss work, study plans, etc.

    This not only improves their enthusiasm for work, but also trains cadres and promotes work.

    The work of the Telecommunications Work Group still has many shortcomings, such as insufficient integration of general publicity and solving practical problems, too few solutions to the specific difficulties of workers, no material rewards, insufficient praise and criticism, poor planning, and insufficient in-depth work.

    Finally, our opinion is that it is best to have fewer but better working cadres. Comrades who have not worked before become emotional when they see others are very busy and they don’t know how to do it. Rural cadres and urban cadres have different habits, and it is easy to have conflicts. The work is extremely busy after entering the city, and it feels overwhelming to solve internal problems again. Secondly, before entering the city, the relationship between the Party, administration, and trade union should be clearly defined as much as possible to avoid disputes in the work.

    天津电讯工作组工作的介绍
    天津电讯企业共分两大系统，一为“天津电讯局”，下设七个分局，十八个营业处所，三个收发信台，及塘沽、静海、独流等电信局，北平七区管理局天津机务站，全局职工一七五八人，加平管局天津机务站共二○○二人，有电话一万七千架，电报分有线无线两种，几可达全国。
    另一为“中央电工器材厂”，下有三个分厂，及中央无线电厂、中美无线电器材公司、联勤修造厂及电台等，有职工一千三百多人。主要生产为电池、发电机、变压器、电线、电话机、电泡、电扇及收发报机、无线电装配等。
    两大系统，五十三个单位，共计职工三千三百多人，一般职工都有相当文化程度，职员中有很多留学生和大学生，一般工人都有小学以上程度，文盲很少。以上所述就是天津电讯企业一般的情况。现在为了便于说明天津电讯工作组的工作，特分别介绍于下：
  （一）工作的经过
    电讯工作组共三十人，来自六个单位（党、团、职校、市训班，城工部），半数以上为原在农村工作的同志。在入城前我们曾在组织上思想上作了些准备：如干部的配备，思想动员等。又拟定了具体工作步骤，讨论了军代与工作组的关系，虽然由于时间的短促，这些准备工作没有能做得完善，但对以后工作已有很大帮助。
    接管人员与工作组，在入城前都作了些准备工作，所以在战斗结果后四小时，先遣人员即到达了接管的单位，其他人员亦先后赶到，分赴各单位迅速进行工作。首先由军事代表在电讯总局召集全局科长以上职员会议（在中央无线电厂召开全体职工大会），宣布了我们的政策，并责成原局长迅速复工。利用原有组织机构，很快的布置下去，第一天即恢复电话九一二一户，第二天线工出发修线，报到人员即达百分之八十（现已全部报到）。
  （二）掌握积极分子的思想动向
    天津电讯局在解放前曾有过一次罢工，被捕三十多人，解放后职工情绪激昂，要求斗争伪工会特务走狗，撤换坏职员，电讯局墙上贴出了“清算××”的标语，以前罢工时的积极分子情绪更激烈，坐过牢的人不免有些报复思想，其次，要求调整工资、扩大医务所、改革旧制度等，一切问题都要求迅速解决。
    职工的思想顾虑是怕裁人，怕参军，怕吃小米（国民党宣传说共产党来后要吃小米要参军），而职员尤怕国民党宣传的所谓“斗争”。
    由于国民党反动宣传所造成职工政治上的闭塞，部份职工存在着糊涂思想，正统观念。但总的来看，左倾思想急性病当时是占着上风的。
    根据以上的思想情况，召集积极分子会议（包括罢工领袖，被捕职工及我们入城后的护厂委员会等），先发动他们对接管工作提意见，针对一些不正确的思想，宣布政策，说明采取农村式斗争手段的害处，进行反复的解释，同时对他们加以安慰，表示我们知道他们在维护工人利益的功劳和所受的迫害。
    然后分配具体工作，把他们引导到党的政策上来，通过他们，把我们的政策传达到职工中去。
    掌握积极分子，尤其是纠正他们的思想偏向，是个很重要的工作，一般说他们都有威信，有群众基础，运用他们去工作，收效大，话从他们口中说出来工人更相信，能掌握住这批积极分子，工作容易推进，亦不会发生大的偏向。
  （三）宣教工作
    除大会小会漫谈会等进行阶级教育宣传政策外，为了提高觉悟，稳定情绪，培养积极分子，我们首先把暂时不能复工的职工组成学习班，约四百人组成二十一个小组，政治学习与技术学习结合，以政治为主。由旧局长负责技术学习，组长中选出五人成立一学委会，分工负责进行一切学习事宜。已复工的组成业余学习，每星期二次，每次一小时。
    学习班结束后，另成立了二个短期学习班，每班约二百五十人左右，每七天一期，请人讲大课、讨论。
    以上这些学习的内容主要为将革命进行到底，劳大决议，新民主主义论等。
    工厂系统除外，在电讯局系统下，前后参加学习的已占三分之二。
    另外通过各种会议来进行教育培养干部，号召积极生产，如组织平津庆祝大会，新春同乐会，“二七”纪念会等。在“二七”大会上号召全体职工要在短期内修好线路，提出使全市电话都要打得通来纪念“二七”。当场线路工友就起来响应号召，保证完成。次日工程所刘淮等即出发助线工修线。职员们说，我们不会修线，就替工友推推车也有用，这样更鼓励了线工的积极性。这种以提高工人的劳动积极性来影响技术人员和一般职员来逐渐改变他们的思想、作风，是改造旧职员的最好方式之一，同时又可以减轻工人对职员原有的气愤，增进职工团结。
  （四）职工参加清点工作
    由工人群众选举代表参加清点，开始在领导思想上不够明确，不敢放手，惟恐混进流氓、坏人，甚至要求工作组绝对保证才能参加，所以这一工作就没有全面展开。但我们争取着作，就是一面加强工人教育，一面谨慎选举职工代表参加。中央无线电厂成立了清点委员会，由军代、工作组、职工代表三方面组成，分成四个组分头进行清点。
    结果有工人参加清点的单位，都查出了很多漏报的东西，如电信总局仓库有三轴电缆（约二百公尺），没有报帐，蓄电池十个没有报帐，三局电缆二个半轴（一轴）没有报帐，清册上写着一尺皮线，查出三千公尺，一个仓库的内间有电话机一百多架，及其他材料，根本没有上清册，又有册上写的是交换机，清查时拿了别的机器顶替，这些问题都在工人协同清点下发现出来了。
    同时工人由于参加了清点，积极性也提高了，感到自己真是企业主人翁了，对清点非常认真负责，黑暗的角落也钻进去仔细的查点，把与清册不符的都记下来，并回来向选举他的职工汇报。
    事实证明，此次接管工作，凡有工人参加清点的部门，不仅能清点出很多东西出来，而且也发动了工人群众工作积极性。
  （五）成立职工代表会
    我们在开始组织代表会时，先拟就了一个草案，在职工中进行酝酿，作好准备工作之后，即召开大会进行动员，首先说明代表会与伪工会的区别，成立职工代表会的意义、任务、选什么样的人、怎样选。然后宣布按行政划分，每三十人选一代表，不满十五人合并到其他部门，超过四十五人的选二人为代表，余以此类推。
    会后又让他们分组讨论，定出代表条件，即开始进行选举，先提名再以无记名投票选候选人，再进行竞选反竞选及正式选。在选举候选人时，如果发现特务坏人当选，则可在反竞选中反掉他。如电讯二分局，曾有一个坏分子，在选举前请过十二人吃饭，结果他被选为候选人。我们立即发动职工搜集他做坏事的材料，在反竞选中职工们提出了他违反工人阶级利益的证据，当场表决取消其候选资格。
    先在职工多的单位选出了代表，在这里取得经验推到各小单位，各单位都先后陆续成立了代表会。电讯电系统选出七十多代表，又以局为单位按人数选出常务代表十七人组成常委会，推举主席一人，副主席二人，内分组织、宣教、生产、福利四部，另设秘书处及合作社。代表会成立后立刻进行接收伪工会的资材、档案及合作社，并在取得行政上的同意下接收了福利委员会。
    经过这些宣传教育工作，并解决了工人一些实际问题如兑换金元券等问题，工人的觉悟性积极性逐渐提高了，开始转变了劳动态度。如中央无线电厂工人献出很多工具，电信局线工以前需要七个人做的工作，现在五个人便完成任务。职员与工人的关系亦有了改善。在这次准备民主改革广泛征求职工意见时，过高的要求，过左的思想，都较少了。
  （六）任用原在地下工作的同志
    以上这些工作，单靠工作组是做不了的，主要是任用地下工作同志，和发动群众自己办自己的事情。
    对于原有的地下工作同志，需要一面加紧政策教育，一面大胆放手运用他们，培养他们的威信，一切事情通过他们去做。例如在庆祝平津会、同乐会等工作中，我们只是掌握原则问题，具体工作都委托原有地下工作的同志去做，他们熟悉情况，有办法、能力一般地不弱于工作组同志。
    以前的学习班都要工作组强的干部去领导，现在电讯局学习班已能由他们自己联系教员，编组，并在未开始学习前，组成学委会，讨论工作，学习计划等。
    这样既提高了他们的工作积极性，也培养了干部，推进了工作。
    电讯工作组的工作还存在着很多缺点，如一般的宣传与解决实际问题结合作得不够，对工人具体困难的解决太少，没有进行物质奖励，对表扬和批评亦不够，计划性差，工作不够深入等。
    最后，我们的意见是工作干部最好少而精。没有工作过的同志看人家很忙，自己不会做就闹情绪：农村干部与城市干部习惯不同，亦易发生矛盾。入城后工作极忙，再要解决内部问题就感到应付不过来。其次，在入城前要尽量把党、行政、工会三方面关系规定明确，以避免在工作中发生纠纷。
