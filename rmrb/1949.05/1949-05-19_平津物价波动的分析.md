　　Analysis of Price Fluctuations in the Pingjin Area
    Yang Bo
    From mid-April to the beginning of this month, prices in the Pingjin area, led by grain, have been rising rapidly. In the past month, the average price of various goods has increased by about one-fold. Therefore, the questions of "Why have prices in Pingjin risen so quickly?" and "How will prices change in the future?" have become issues of urgent concern for people of all classes. To this end, I will discuss the above issues to the best of my knowledge as follows:
    Why have prices in the Pingjin area risen so much in recent months? We believe:
    First, from a seasonal perspective, we are now in the lean season between harvests, especially in central Hebei, where the serious floods last year have led to a severe spring famine. In addition, the prolonged drought in North China in the previous period has led the vast number of farmers, under the call to fight drought and prepare for famine, to not only stop selling their stored grain but also to try to purchase and store grain in preparation for a drought year. Grain prices have therefore risen step by step, forming the abnormal phenomenon that grain prices in Pingjin were lower than in rural areas of central and southern Hebei. Central and southern Hebei were originally grain-producing areas with surplus grain to supply Pingjin; now, large quantities of grain are flowing south, and Pingjin must rely on transporting grain from the Northeast and Chahar to regulate the market. Thousands of merchants from central and southern Hebei come to Pingjin to purchase grain every day. This is the main reason for the recent price fluctuations in Pingjin.
    Secondly, since the beginning of the Pingjin Campaign, with the deployment of a large number of troops around Pingjin, the demand for materials has been huge, and the currency circulation in Pingjin has also increased considerably. At the same time, due to the long-term lack of industrial products in the vast rural areas around Pingjin, and Tianjin being the main foreign trade port in North China, since the liberation of Pingjin, purchasing merchants from as far east as Shandong, as far west as northern Shaanxi, and as far south as Henan have come to purchase industrial products in large quantities. At the same time, the supply of rural materials to Pingjin is not very smooth, so the currency cannot circulate smoothly. This has created a certain degree of currency concentration in Pingjin.
    Thirdly, a considerable number of speculative merchants in Pingjin are engaging in speculation and profiteering in the market, which is also one of the main reasons for the recent price fluctuations. For example, among the many private grain sales outlets entrusted by state-owned trading companies in Pingjin, some not only do not sell large quantities of grain at the prices stipulated by our trading companies when prices rise, but instead take the opportunity to raise prices and hoard goods in the market to achieve their speculative and profiteering goals. Originally, based on the population of four million in Pingjin, in addition to the people's own adjustments, state-owned trading companies could maintain the stability of grain prices by selling two million catties of grain every day. However, due to the speculative activities of these merchants in the market, state-owned trading companies have sometimes sold as much as five million catties of grain in one day in recent months, and still cannot maintain the stability of grain prices.
    The above points are the basic reasons for the recent price fluctuations. Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the future development trend of prices, a general outline can be obtained from the following facts.
    (1) The grain shortage has now been relatively alleviated. On the 11th of this month, it rained thoroughly in the areas west and north of Pingjin, and autumn grain and cotton have been planted. Most areas of southern Hebei and parts of central Hebei have also received rain successively and can barely be planted. In addition, farmers everywhere are fighting natural disasters by digging wells to irrigate the land and carrying water to plant. Moreover, this year's drought is only a local phenomenon in North China, and most other liberated areas are expected to have a bumper harvest. Therefore, grain prices in other areas during this period are relatively stable. For example, in the Northeast, various prices not only did not rise in April but also fell back by 3 percent, of which grain prices fell by 9 percent; in Jinan, Shandong, prices rose by an average of only 13 percent in April, of which grain prices rose by 10 percent; and in the Central Plains and Northwest, prices of various goods rose by only 8 percent during the same period. Comparing the current grain prices in the above areas with Pingjin, they are still lower than in Pingjin. For example, on the 10th of this month, the prices of millet in various places were: 24.5 yuan per catty in Jinan, 7 yuan in Yan'an, 17.5 yuan in Xuzhou, 24 yuan in Kaifeng, 21 yuan in Zhengzhou, 4,800 Northeast currency in Shenyang, equivalent to 16 yuan in people's currency. Grain prices in Zhangjiakou are also often one-third lower than in Pingjin. Grain purchased by state-owned trading companies from the Northeast and other places is now arriving in Pingjin in a steady stream. Based on the above situation, we believe that the grain supply in Pingjin is fully guaranteed in the future, and the gradual stabilization of grain prices is also expected.
    (2) The People's Liberation Army, which was concentrated in the Pingjin area in the past, has now moved south, and the supply and demand of market materials will also tend to be normal. At the same time, Wuhan has been liberated, and Shanghai is about to be liberated. The large number of purchasing merchants who were concentrated in Pingjin will also move south with the liberation of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. Therefore, the concentration of currency and the stimulation of price increases in Pingjin will also be greatly reduced in the future.
    (3) Due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the decline of production and the diversion of large amounts of capital to speculative activities have not fundamentally changed in Pingjin. A large amount of speculative capital has not yet shifted to production. The activities of this speculative capital in the market have become the biggest obstacle to our people's government in regulating supply and demand and stabilizing prices. Therefore, we must put pressure on this speculative capital in the future and guide it to quickly shift to production. We must strengthen the state-owned economy's control over the market, strengthen market management, and severely crack down on a few speculators who specialize in hoarding and disrupting the market. Only in this way can we ensure the stability of the market in our liberated areas and the smooth development of the new democratic economy.
    In addition, we must also rapidly develop urban supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, so that they can, under the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, connect the exchange between urban and rural areas, ensure the supply of living materials needed by the urban working people, and enable them to avoid the manipulation and plunder of speculative merchants. In this work, our state-owned trading organs must provide strong assistance. After consumer cooperatives have been universally developed in cities, state-owned trading organs can directly distribute a large amount of materials to the vast number of consumers through cooperatives, thereby eliminating the intermediate exploitation of merchants. In this way, speculative capital will have no room for activity, and prices can be expected to be more stable.

　　平津物价波动的分析
    杨波
    自四月中旬到本月上旬，平津地区的物价，由粮食带头上涨，速度较快。一月来各货价格平均上涨了一倍上下，因之“平津物价为何上涨这样快”，“今后物价变化如何”？成为目前我各阶层人民迫切关心的问题。为此，特将上述问题，就管见所及分述如下：
    为什么近月来平津地区物价上涨较大？我们认为：
    首先，从季节上来看，现在正值青黄不接的缺粮季节，特别是冀中部份地区由于去年水灾严重，致形成目前严重的春荒。再加上前一时期华北地区久旱不雨，广大农民在抗旱备荒的号召下，不但手中存粮不再继续出卖，并且设法购存粮食，以备旱年，粮价因此步步上涨。遂形成了前一时期平津两市粮价低于冀中、冀南农村的不正常现象。冀中冀南原是产粮区域，本有余粮可以供给平津；现则粮食大量南流，反而要依靠平津从东北及察绥运粮食来调剂，冀中冀南等地每日来平津购粮的商贩，数以千计。这是此次平津物价波动的主要原因。
    其次，自从平津战役开始以来，随着大量部队的分驻于平津周围，物资需求浩大，平津两地的货币流通量亦随之相当增加。同时周围广大农村由于长时期工业品的缺乏，而天津又为我华北主要的对外贸易港口，因之平津解放以来，东至山东，西至陕北，南至河南，广大地区的采购商即纷纷来此大量采购工业品，同时由于农村物资供给平津不十分畅通，因之货币不能顺利对流。这样也就形成了平津两地一定程度的通货集中的现象。
    再次，平津两地有相当数量的投机商人，在市场上投机倒把，兴风作浪，亦为此次物价波动的主要原因之一，如平津两市我国营贸易公司所委托的许多私商粮食代销店中，有一部份在物价上涨时，不但不依我贸易公司所规定的粮价大量抛售，相反的在市场上趁机抬价，囤积居奇，以达其投机渔利的目的。本来以平津两市四百万人口计算，除人民自己调剂外，我国营贸易公司每日抛售二百万斤粮食，即可相当的保持粮价的平稳。但由于这一批投机商人在市场上的兴风作浪，致使我国营贸易公司近月来有时竟一天中抛售五百万斤粮食，而仍不能保持粮价的稳定。
    上述各点是此次物价波动的基本原因，今后物价发展变化的趋势，虽然精确估计，但可以从以下的事实中，得到一个大概的轮廓。
    （一）粮荒现象现已比较缓和，本月十一日平津以西以北地区已下透雨，已把秋粮和棉花种上；冀南大部地区和冀中部分地区亦已先后得雨，可以勉强下种。加上各地农民打井浇地，挑水点种，可以战胜天灾，而且今年的旱荒只是华北地区局部的现象，其它解放区大多可望丰收，因此这一时期其它地区的粮价是相当稳定的，如东北区四月份各种物价不但未涨，并且回跌了百分之三，其中粮价则下落了百分之九；山东济南的物价四月份平均只上涨了百分之十三，其中粮价上涨了百分之十；中原与西北两区同期各货价格亦仅上涨了百分之八。如就目前上述各区之粮价与平津对比，则还低于平津地区，如本月十日各地小米价格：济南每斤小米二十四元五角，延安七元，徐州十七元五角，开封二十四元，郑州二十一元，沈阳东北币四千八百元、合人民票十六元。张家口的粮价与平津比较，亦经常低三分之一以上。国营贸易公司从东北等地采购的粮食，现正源源运抵平津。基于上述情况，我们认为今后平津两地的粮食供应是有充分保证的，而粮价的逐渐稳定亦是可以预期的。
    （二）过去集中于平津附近地区的人民解放军，现已南下，市场物资的供求量，亦将随之趋于正常。同时武汉已经解放，上海即将解放，过去集中于平津两地之大量采购商人，亦必将随着京沪武汉等地的解放而南移，因之今后平津地区的通货集中，刺激物价上涨的现象，亦必大大减少。
    （三）由于国民党反动派长期统治，造成了生产事业的衰退，大量资本转向投机事业，这种现象在我平津两市，到目前为止基本上仍未转变，大量的投机资本仍未转向生产事业。而这批投机资本在市场上的活动，就成为目前我人民政府在调剂供求、平抑物价工作上的一个最大的阻力。因此我们今后须对这一批投机资本施以压力，引导其迅速转向生产事业。必须加强国营经济对市场的控制力量，加强市场管理，对少数专事囤积居奇扰乱市场的投机份子，必须予以严厉的打击。只有如此，才有可能保证我解放区市场的稳定，和新民主主义经济的顺利发展。
    此外我们更必须迅速发展城市中的供销合作和消费合作事业，使他们可能在国营经济的领导和扶助下，沟通城市与乡村间的交换，保证城市劳动人民所需生活资料的供给，使他们能避免投机商人的操纵和掠夺。在这一工作中，我国营贸易机关必须大力帮助。在城市的消费合作社已普遍发展以后，国营贸易机关即可将大量的物资通过合作社而直接分配给广大的消费者，借以免除商人的中间剥削。这样投机资本便无活动余地，物价可望更为平稳。
