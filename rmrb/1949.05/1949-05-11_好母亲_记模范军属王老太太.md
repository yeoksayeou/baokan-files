	"Good Mother"
	—A Profile of Model Military Family Member Old Lady Wang
	He Zhenlang

	At a grand army-civilian get-together, the Fourth Field Army's 402nd Regiment presented a silk banner inscribed "Good Mother" to Old Lady Wang, a military family member who had traveled 400 *li* to visit.

	Old Lady Wang is the mother of Wang Zhenzhang, the bugler of the 402nd Regiment headquarters. This 49-year-old rural woman is the Communist Party branch's group leader and vice-director of the village women's association in a village in Wuqiang County, Hebei. She hadn't seen her son, who had joined the army, for eleven years. When she received the news that Wang Zhenzhang was following the army into the pass, she was very happy and walked all the way from her hometown to the garrison to see him. Although the old mother had not seen her beloved son for so long, she only stayed one night and went back. She said that she was a village cadre, and the village was preparing for spring plowing and needed her to go back to work.

	In the village, she is a good mother, a good Party member, and a good cadre. She pays close attention to learning the Communist Party's leadership methods. She often tells people that leadership work relies on political persuasion and following the mass line. She actively takes the lead in implementing the Party's policies. After being elected as the Party group leader, she cultivated five actively working farmers into Party members within ten months. The Communist Party group she leads is a successful leadership core in the village. As soon as Old Lady Wang arrived at the troops, she immediately inquired about her son's performance from the soldiers and cadres. When she heard everyone say that Wang Zhenzhang "had no family concept," she happily said, "I am relieved." But when she learned that Wang Zhenzhang had joined the Party later than herself, she said to her son with a displeased expression, "You are not as progressive as your mother!" The relationship between her and her son is not only the love between mother and son, but also permeates a strong sense of comradeship. She went on to say, "Your brother is a labor model at home. Every time the village elects models, he is always first or second. You are not as active as your brother! The most important thing for a Party member is to take the lead in everything and not be afraid of hardship." These words hit Wang Zhenzhang's shortcomings. At the get-together, he expressed his determination to his mother and everyone, saying, "I will resolutely overcome the past problems of complaining, being afraid of hardship, and not studying, and strive to perform meritorious service for the people during the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign!" Old Lady Wang was happy and said, "That's right! That's right!"

	Old Lady Wang never forgets to conduct class education among the masses. She told her son, "Don't forget the days when your mother took you begging for food, and your father died without even a coffin. Now our family has houses and land, and the government sends meat and flour and hangs glory plaques during the New Year. We have truly turned over. But don't forget that the people of Jiangnan have not yet been liberated! We must work hard to liberate all of China. Only then can we be worthy of the Party and the people!" She repeatedly urged the soldiers of the regiment headquarters, "Work hard to cross the Yangtze River and wipe out the reactionary army cleanly. I will also improve production in the village in the rear. We must eradicate Chiang Kai-shek's die-hards, otherwise they will harm us again!" The next day, she happily returned.

    “好母亲”
    ——记模范军属王老太太
    何镇浪    
    在一个盛大的军民联欢会上，第四野战军四零二团将一面“好母亲”的锦缎红旗，献给从四百里外来访的军属王老太太。
    王老太太是四零二团团部司号长王振章的母亲。这个年已四十九岁的农村妇女，是河北武强县一个村的共产党支部的小组长和村妇女会副主任。她已经有十一年没看到她的参军的儿子了。得到王振章随军进关的消息时，她非常高兴，从家乡徒步赶到驻地来看他。老母亲虽这样久没有见到她疼爱的儿子，可是她只住一宿就回去了。她说：她是村干部，现在村里正准备春耕，需要她回去工作。
    在村里，她是个好母亲，好党员，好干部，她很注意学习共产党的领导方法，她经常对人讲：领导工作要靠政治说服，走群众路线才行。她积极带头执行党的政策，被选为党的小组长以后，她十个月内培养了五个积极工作的农民成为党员，她领导的共产党小组是村中一个有成绩的领导核心。王老太太一到部队，马上向战士们和干部们打听儿子的表现。听到大家反映王振章“没有家庭观念”时，她高兴地说：“我放心了”。可是当她知道王振章入党的时间比自己还短时，她便带着不高兴的神情对儿子说：“你还不如你母亲进步呢！”她和儿子之间，不仅仅是母子之爱，同时还渗透着浓厚的同志之爱，她接着说：“你兄弟在家是个劳动模范，每回村里选举模范他总是第一、二名。你还不如你兄弟积极呢！做党员最重要的是——事事要带头，不怕苦”。这些话正说到王振章的缺点上。他在联欢大会上向母亲和大家表示决心说：“坚决克服过去讲怪话（发牢骚），怕吃苦，不学习的毛病，争取在渡江作战时为人民立功！”王老太太这才快乐起来，连说：“这才对！这才对！”
    王老太太时时不忘对群众进行阶级教育，她叮咛儿子说：“不要忘记——妈妈带着你讨饭的日子，你父亲死了都没棺材装。现在咱们家有房有地了，过年时，政府还给送肉送面，挂光荣牌，真个是翻身了。可别忘了江南老百姓还没解放哪！还得努力解放全中国。这才对得起党和人民呢！”她再三嘱咐团部的战士们：“努力打过长江去，干干净净消灭反动军队，我在后方也要把村里生产提高起来。对蒋介石死党一定要铲草除根，不然他还会祸害我们！”第二天，她就高高兴兴的回去了。
