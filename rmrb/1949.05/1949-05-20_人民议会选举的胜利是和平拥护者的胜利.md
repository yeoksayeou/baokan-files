　　The Victory of the People's Assembly Election is a Victory for the Advocates of Peace
    Bulgarian Communist Party's "People's Business Daily" Commentary
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th] Sofia News: The Bulgarian Communist Party organ "People's Business Daily" commented on the victory of the Fatherland Front in the local People's Assembly elections, stating: "The victory of the Fatherland Front in this election shows that its enemies—the remnants of Bulgarian reactionaries—are completely isolated today. In our country, apart from the Fatherland Front, there is no other social or political force that can unite the people in spirit and politics. The victory also shows that only under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which has been tested for a long time and resolutely and faithfully adheres to the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, can the Fatherland Front complete its historical mission. The victory on May 15th is a victory for the advocates of peace. The unanimous approval of the Fatherland Front's policies by the working people reflects their will to further consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union and cooperation with the people's democratic countries, and to further strengthen the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism."

    保共人民事业报评论
    【新华社北平十九日电】索非亚讯：保共机关报人民事业报评地方人民议会选举中祖国阵线的胜利称：祖国陈线在这次选举中的胜利说明它的敌人——保国反动派残余，今天是完全孤立了。在我们国家，能够在精神上、政治上团结人民的，除祖国阵线外，再没有别的社会的、政治的力量了。胜利也说明了，只有在久经考验的、坚决而忠贞地恪守马克思——列宁主义不朽学说的保加利亚共产党的领导下，祖国阵线才能完成它的历史任务。五月十五日的胜利，是和平拥护者的胜利。劳动人民一致赞同祖国阵线的政策，反映了他们为进一步巩固对苏联的友谊以及与人民民主国家合作的意志，为进一步加强和平，民主与社会主义阵营的意志。
