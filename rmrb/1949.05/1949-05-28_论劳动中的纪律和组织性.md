Editorial by the Bolshevik Magazine

Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people are smoothly carrying out the struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan in four years. The organized and rapid development of various sectors of the Soviet Union's economy and culture after the war has set an example for the world. As in the years of the pre-war Five-Year Plans, the vast working people are led by a passion for creation in restoring and further developing the national economy. The great goal of building a perfect communist society inspires them.

In the struggle to overcome difficulties and accelerate the development of the national economy, consolidating discipline and organization in every possible way is a powerful weapon in the hands of our working people.

As a result of the great October Socialist Revolution and the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the very nature of labor discipline has fundamentally changed. Obviously, the nature of discipline is entirely determined by the nature of the prevailing relations of production. Under the capitalist system, discipline in production is a forced discipline rooted in the terror of starvation and unemployment. The meaning of this discipline is to guarantee the conditions for capitalist exploitation. It (discipline - translator) is entirely supported by foremen employed by capital and by the organization of the entire capitalist enterprise. This discipline serves capital; it is a tool for capital to oppress and exploit the working people.

Soviet society has created a new, socialist labor discipline. Under socialist conditions, discipline in production is the conscious discipline of workers liberated from exploitation, whose relations are those of comradely cooperation and socialist mutual assistance. Consolidating this discipline is beneficial to the entire society and to each working person themselves, because the development of social production and the struggle to realize communism reflect the vital interests of the working people, guaranteeing their material well-being and continuous cultural advancement.

The very conditions of large-scale, planned, and organized socialist production based on the latest technology require a high degree of discipline from workers. Lenin wrote: "All types of machine industry – that is, the material productive source and foundation of socialism – demand unconditional and strict unity of will, directing the joint labors of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of people." He continued, "In order to successfully conduct work procedures organized according to the type of large machine industry, it is absolutely necessary to submit to a unified will." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 23, Page 462)

Under the capitalist system, the organization and discipline within an enterprise exist under conditions of anarchic production across the entire economy. In the Soviet Union, due to the dominance of social ownership of the means of production, the entire economy is a unified entity, with the actions of its various parts coordinated and closely adapted to the state's overall national economic plan. In pointing out the characteristics of the organizational role in the socialist economy, Lenin pointed out: "Neither railways, nor steamships, nor large machines and enterprises can work accurately without the unity of will that links all the working people involved into an economic body which works as accurately as clockwork. Large-scale machine industry creates socialism. And if the working masses, who are inclined towards socialism, cannot make their organization work as it should work in large-scale machine industry, then there is no point in talking about realizing socialism.” (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 23, Page 420.)

The socialist economy, based on socialist public ownership, cannot develop spontaneously; it requires centralized, planned leadership, submission to a unified will, great organization, and discipline. Under these conditions, the discipline and organization of each worker, wherever they work, has social significance. It is clear why the issue of discipline in our country has always been the focus of attention of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government. The state manages the accounting and supervision of the amount and need for labor. Society and the state require every working person to work faithfully, obey the dispatch of leaders, and abide by established order.

The Bolshevik Party tirelessly educates the broad masses of the people in the spirit of socialist labor discipline. The party's leaders, Lenin and Stalin, placed the task of educating in the new discipline in an extremely important position in the earliest years of the Soviet regime. Lenin pointed out that this task had world-historical significance. Lenin and Stalin taught us that the new discipline does not fall from the sky. The Soviet state and the Bolshevik Party should make great efforts to educate and cultivate the new labor discipline and the relationship between people. Regarding this task, Lenin warned us: "This is a task with enormous difficulties, but it is also an extremely rewarding task, because only when we actually solve this task can we drive the last nail into the coffin of the capitalist society we have buried." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 23, Page 44) Lenin regarded the education of the new socialist labor discipline as one of the forms of class struggle against the traditions and forces of the old society.

The enemies of the people – the Trotskyites and Bukharinites – waged a frenzied struggle against Bolshevik discipline and organization. They attempted to undermine the iron discipline within the party, they opposed labor discipline in enterprises, and they opposed centralization. The Bolshevik Party exposed these enemies' conspiracies, smashed them, and further strengthened the unity and discipline in its ranks. At the same time, the Bolshevik Party implemented the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, constantly training the working people in the new socialist labor discipline, educating them in the spirit of socialism, and raising their socialist consciousness and organization.

The Party's activities have yielded great and good results. People are educating themselves in the process of socialist construction in our country. The change in the spiritual outlook of the Soviet people is first and foremost manifested in the affirmation of a new attitude towards labor, regarding it as a glorious, splendid, and heroic undertaking for the entire society. The Bolshevik Party carries out education among the people with a high degree of consciousness of the interests of the whole people, uniting the working people in a unified organizational collective to realize the task of socialist construction with world-historical significance. The spirit of organization and discipline is vividly manifested in the socialist emulation of the entire people. In the mass movement to complete and over-fulfill production plans, Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals have demonstrated a high degree of socialist organization and discipline. The model of the new labor discipline, freed from exploitation, is our advanced elements in production, the Stakhanovite workers, and the heroes of socialist labor. Socialism has produced new relationships between people, new production organization, and new labor discipline.

Germans sometimes pride themselves on their discipline. But this is the discipline of executioners, without thought, the result of the Prussian landlord-bourgeois police state. The most organized and disciplined people in the world today are the Soviet people. Their organization and discipline have arisen in conscious socialist labor, in the environment of the struggle against all the remnants of the old society, and in the common fraternal struggle for the building of a new communist society. The mighty power of socialist organization was vividly displayed to the whole world during the Patriotic War. The new conscious discipline was tested on the battlefield and in the conscious labor in the rear, and this discipline achieved a victory over the executioner's discipline in the minds of the Germans. Now, this discipline and organization are manifested again in the victorious struggle to restore and develop the economy and to further prosper the socialist motherland.

The new socialist discipline created in the process of socialist production is our great achievement. But the remnants of capitalism still remain in the consciousness of the working people, and sometimes manifest themselves as lack of discipline, lack of organization, slackness and laziness, and reluctance to work. It would be dangerous to close our eyes to these. This situation is not uncommon in industrial enterprises and collective farms, where the leaders and general personnel usually treat this phenomenon with an amiable and indifferent attitude. Nine collective farm members in Ukraine wrote to Comrade Stalin not long ago: A portion of collective farm members still do very badly in their work in the collective farm, do not treat their responsibilities and obligations faithfully, violate the rules of agricultural cooperation, and do not even observe the minimum number of workdays. And the managers of these collective farms turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the violators of labor discipline, the lazy people, and the hypocritical collective farm members. They (referring to the violators of labor discipline - translator) only think about how to get more from the collective farm, and live off the labor of the honest collective farm members who are moving forward. It should be stated frankly and openly that we often overlook such facts and do not wage a real struggle against the backward consciousness of some collective farm members, against the lazy people and violators of labor discipline. As a result, the bad work of certain collective farm members completely undermines the good work of the advanced elements of the entire collective farm.

"Do we not have the right to speak about this? Can we not demand and urge all those who can and should work well, to observe the minimum number of workdays and work standards and work well? We can and should do this..."

In these words of the collective farm members in Ukraine, the thoughts of all honest workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals in our country are expressed. When all honest workers see that the lazy people, the reluctant workers, and the idlers lower our economic achievements, causing the work of the advanced elements to suffer losses, disrupting the completion of plans, and making work chaotic and disorganized, their anger is completely understandable. The struggle against lazy people and idlers to consolidate labor discipline is supported wholeheartedly by all workers. Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations should continuously explain the significance of discipline to the working people, especially young workers and collective farmers, "explaining the rules established in production, the Soviet laws regarding labor discipline."

When Comrade Stalin spoke about the necessity of consolidating labor discipline in his report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union" in 1926, he pointed out: "It should be explained to the workers, especially to those who have not long entered the factories, that if they allow idleness in their actions and do not promote labor productivity, this is harmful to the common cause, harmful to the working class, and harmful to our industry. Fight against idleness, raise labor productivity, for the benefit of our industry, for the benefit of the entire working class. That is the task."

The 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) put forward the task of completely eliminating idleness. "The Party organization - the Congress resolution stated - the trade unions, and the staff of industry and transport must wage a tireless struggle to consolidate labor discipline in industry and transport. Remember that the task of combating worker turnover and idleness is not a temporary movement, but a continuous work to be carried out among the masses."

Soviet society requires all people to work according to their abilities. That is to say, every working person should work to the greatest possible extent of their strength and ability, using every minute of working time for production, not being satisfied with completing tasks, but striving to exceed them. Socialist discipline, Lenin said, is "self-governing and automatic discipline in struggle," it is conscious discipline in creative, liberated labor. Under the socialist system, the masses themselves find and discover new and better methods of production work, more effective organizational methods, and methods of consolidating discipline in the course of practical struggle.

In industry, the experience of the Stakhanovite workers shows that the full utilization of the working day, combined with the improvement of labor organization and technology, is the condition for their production achievements. The Stakhanovite workers, Comrade Stalin said, are cultured people, proficient in technology, people who can value the time factor in their work, scientifically calculating time not only in minutes but in seconds, people who can automatically break down old technical standards and create new and higher standards. This is also typically depicted in the Stakhanovite workers in agriculture, the heroes of socialist labor who achieved high results in farming and animal husbandry in 1947. The collective farmers in the "Red October" collective farm in Voronezh Province showed a vivid example of socialist creative labor and organization. In 1947, they harvested an average of one hundred poods of grain per hectare on 1,313 hectares of land. For the extremely high results, the Soviet government gave eleven members of this collective farm the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

The struggle for socialist labor discipline and for raising organization cannot be separated from the development of creative initiative and socialist emulation among the working people. The new upsurge of socialist emulation currently underway is a clear demonstration of the increased consciousness and discipline of laborers in socialist society.

Naturally, in carrying out educational work and raising creative initiative and emulation in labor, effective methods such as criticism and self-criticism should not be discarded but rather adopted in the struggle to consolidate labor discipline. Because the more the creative enthusiasm of the masses is brought into play, the more intolerable individual neglect of discipline becomes, and the more it will encounter the rebuke and indignation of the working people.

The struggle to consolidate discipline, along with the adoption of educational methods and methods of persuasion, should also employ methods of coercion - all the organizational methods stipulated by the internal rules of enterprises, the regulations of agricultural cooperatives, and Soviet legislation. Lenin pointed out that the struggle against disorganization and lack of discipline "cannot be carried out solely by propaganda and agitation, solely by organizing competition, solely by selecting organizers, the struggle also needs to be carried out by methods of compulsion." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 22, Page 460)

The organization and discipline of each worker is a necessary condition for the consolidation of organization in the enterprise and even in the entire national economy. The Party demands that discipline and order in production be strengthened tirelessly. In the decision of the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the tasks of the Party organizations in industry and transport, the following issues became the focus of basic attention: namely, establishing order in production, fighting against unplanned rushes of activity, adopting strict technical discipline in the use of planned charts, eliminating lazy people, and consolidating the centralized system and leadership in enterprises. All these measures are aimed at consolidating organization and order in enterprises and raising the culture of labor. The implementation of these measures plays a huge role in our economic development.

The high degree of organization and discipline of workers in Soviet society is one of the advantages of the socialist system. This advantage has been fully proven during the period of socialist peaceful construction and during wartime. The power of organization helped the Soviet people to overcome the difficulties caused by the brutal war after the war and to continue to develop the socialist economy. But this also means that in order to move forward more successfully, the Soviet people should further improve their discipline and organization, and unreservedly eradicate all lazy and disorganized elements.

The Bolshevik Party, cultivated by Lenin and Stalin, is the highest example of organization and discipline. In the spirit of Bolshevik organization, our Party tirelessly educates the working people, unites them, and unifies them with socialist discipline. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government lead the entire construction of the new society, adding the foundation of organization and discipline to the entire creative work of the country. In every part of the great construction, the Party and government organize, mobilize, and unite the working people and guide their efforts towards a consistent goal - towards consolidating the economic power of our country, and building a perfect communist society.

### 论劳动中的纪律和组织性

　　论劳动中的纪律和组织性
    布尔什维克杂志社论
    苏维埃人民在列宁--斯大林党的领导下，顺利地进行着四年完成战后五年计划的斗争。苏维埃国家的经济和文化各部门，在战后有组织地迅速地发展，给全世界作了一个榜样。象在战前各五年计划年份中一样，创造的热情，领导了恢复和推动国民经济更向前发展的广大劳动人民。伟大的目标--建设完美的共产主义社会，鼓舞着他们。
    在为克服困难，加速发展国民经济的斗争中，用一切方法巩固纪律和组织性，是掌握在我国劳动人民手中的有力武器。
    由于伟大的十月社会主义革命，社会主义在苏联胜利的结果，劳动纪律的本身性质根本改变了。显然的，纪律的性质完全决定于占统治地位的生产关系的性质。在资本主义制度之下，生产中的纪律是植根于挨饿和失业恐怖之下的强迫的纪律。这种纪律的含义就是保证资本主义剥削的条件。它（纪律--译者）完全是为受资本雇佣的监工们，为整个资本主义大企业的组织支持着的。这种纪律是为资本服务的，它是资本压迫和剥削劳动人民的工具。
    苏维埃社会创造了新的，社会主义的劳动纪律。在社会主义条件之下，生产中的纪律是由剥削之下解放出来的工人的自觉纪律，他们的关系是同志合作和社会主义的互助的关系。巩固这种纪律是有利于整个社会和每个劳动人民自己的，因为社会生产的发展，为实现共产主义的斗争，都显示着劳动人民的切身利益，保证他们的物质幸福和文化不断的上升。
    基于最新技术的大规模的有计划有组织的社会主义生产条件的本身，就要求着工作者的高度纪律性。列宁写道：“一切类型的机器工业--亦即社会主义的物质的生产根源和基础--要求无条件的、严格的意志统一，以规划几百人，几千人，几万人的协同工作。”接着他又写道：“为了成功地进行按照大机器工业类型组织起来的工作程序，毫无疑义，服从统一的意志是绝对必要的。”（列宁全集二十三卷四六二页）
    在资本主义制度之下，企业内部的组织和纪律是存在于整个经济范围内无政府生产的条件之下的。在苏联，由于生产手段社会公有制统治的结果，整个经济就是一个统一体，其各个部分的行动是相互配合的，是与国家总的国民经济的计划密切适应的。列宁在指出社会主义经济中组织作用的特性时，指出：“无论是铁路、轮船、大机器及企业，如果没有将一切各个存在的劳动人民联系于一个准确得象时钟一样工作的经济机构中去的意志的统一，他就不能够准确地进行工作。大机器工业产生了社会主义。而如果倾心于社会主义的劳动大众，都不能够使自己的机构象大机器工业应该作地那样去工作，那就不要谈什么实现社会主义了。”（列宁全集二十三卷四二○页。）
    基于社会主义公有制的社会主义经济，不能够自流地发展，它要有一个中心的有计划的领导，服从于统一的意志、伟大的组织性和纪律。在这种条件之下，每个工作者的纪律和组织性，无论他在那里工作，都具有着社会的意义。为什么在我国纪律问题总是成为布尔什维克党及苏联政府注意的中心，这就已很明白了。国家管理着劳动量和需要量的核算和监督。社会和国家要求每一个劳动人民忠诚地工作，服从领导者的调度，遵守既定的秩序。
    布尔什维克党不倦地以社会主义劳动纪律的精神教育广大人民。党的领袖列宁和斯大林在苏维埃政权存在的最初几年就将新纪律教育的任务摆在极重要的地位。列宁指出了这个任务具有世界性的历史意义。列宁和斯大林教导我们，新纪律不是由天上掉下来的。苏维埃国家和布尔什维克党应以巨大的努力进行新的劳动纪律和人与人之间的关系的教育和培植工作。关于这个任务，列宁曾警告我们：“这是一项具有巨大困难的任务，但也是极可感激的任务，因为只有当我们实际上解决这个任务的时候，才算对我们所埋葬的资本主义社会的棺材钉了最后一颗钉子。”（列宁全集二十三卷四四页）列宁把新的社会主义劳动纪律的教育看作反对旧社会的传统和力量的阶级斗争的形式之一。
    人民的敌人--托洛茨基分子和布哈林分子--曾进行着反对布尔什维克纪律和组织性的疯狂斗争。他们企图破坏党内的铁的纪律，他们反对企业中的劳动纪律，反对集中。布尔什维克党揭露了这些敌人的阴谋，粉碎了他们，更加巩固了自己队伍中的一致性和纪律。同时，布尔什维克党执行了列宁和斯大林的教训，不断地锻炼劳动人民的新的社会主义的劳动纪律，在社会主义的精神下教育他们，提高他们社会主义的自觉性及组织性。
    党的这种活动得到了伟大的、良好的结果。在我国社会主义建设的进程中人们自己教育着自己。苏维埃人们精神面目的变化，首先就表现在确定了新的劳动态度，把它看成了整个社会事业，光荣的、辉煌的、英雄的事业。布尔什维克党在人民中进行着对全民利益高度自觉的教育，将劳动人民团结在实现社会主义建设的具有世界性历史意义的任务的统一的组织集体中。组织性和纪律的精神鲜明地表现在全体人民的社会主义竞赛中。在为完成和超过完成生产计划的群众运动中，苏维埃工人、农民、知识分子表现了高度社会主义的组织性和纪律性。摆脱了剥削的新的劳动纪律的模范就是我们生产中的先进分子，斯达汉诺夫工作者，社会主义劳动英雄。社会主义产生了新的人与人之间的关系，新的生产组织，新的劳动纪律。
    德国人有的时候也以其纪律自豪。但这是刽子手的、没有思想的纪律，是普鲁士地主--资产阶级警察国家的结果。现在世界上最有组织最有纪律的人民，是苏维埃人民。他们的组织性和纪律性是在自觉的社会主义劳动中，在反对旧社会的一切残渣，在为建立新的共产主义社会的共同友爱的斗争的环境中产生的。社会主义组织性的强大的威力，在爱国战争时期鲜明地摆在全世界的面前。在战场上和在后方的自觉劳动中考验了新的自觉的纪律，这种纪律取得了驾乎德国人思想的刽子手的纪律之上的胜利。现在，这种纪律和组织性又表现在为恢复和发展经济、为更加繁荣社会主义祖国的胜利斗争中。
　　×　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×　　　　×
    在社会主义生产过程中创造起来的新的社会主义纪律，乃是我们的伟大成绩。但在劳动人民的意识中仍残存着资本主义的残余，它在某些时候就表现为无纪律性，无组织性，散漫怠惰，懒于工作，如果闭着眼睛看不到这些，那是危险的。这种情形在工业企业中和集体农庄中是不少的，这些企业的领导者和一般人员，通常都以和和气气的和漠不关心的态度对待这种现象。乌克兰有九个集体农庄庄员不久以前在给斯大林同志的信中写道：一部分集体农庄庄员直到现在在集体农庄中的工作非常不好，没有忠诚地对待自己的责任及义务，破坏着农业合作的规章，不遵守甚至最低限度的工作日。而这些集体农庄的管理人对于劳动纪律的破坏者、懒汉、虚伪的集体农庄庄员，听之任之，熟视无睹。他们（指劳动纪律的破坏者们--译者）只是想，如何能由集体农庄中取得更多，而依靠前进的忠诚的集体农庄庄员的劳动而生活。应该直率地、坦白地承认，我们常常放过这样的事实，没有向部分集体农庄庄员的落后意识，向懒汉和劳动纪律的破坏者进行真正的斗争。结果，某些集体农庄庄员的不好的工作完全破坏了整个集体农庄前进分子的好的工作。
    “难道我们对这个没有权利讲话吗？难道我们不能够要求和促使一切能够而且应该好好工作的人们，遵守最低限度的劳动日和工作标准好好工作吗？我们能够而且应该这样作…………………”
    在乌克兰集体农庄庄员的这些话中，表现了我国的一切诚实的工人、集体农民和知识分子的思想。当着一切忠诚工作者看到懒汉、懒于工作者和无所事事的人降低了我们的经济成果时，使前进分子的工作受到损失时，破坏完成计划时，使工作混乱而缺乏组织性时，他们的愤怒是完全可以理解的。向懒汉和游手好闲者进行斗争以巩固劳动纪律，是得到全体劳动者的万众一心的支持的。党的、青年团的、职工会的组织，应该不断地向劳动人民，特别是年轻的工人和集体农民，解释纪律的意义，“解释生产中制定的规章，关于劳动纪律的苏维埃法律”。
    斯大林同志在一九二六年，在其“关于苏联经济形势”的报告中讲到巩固劳动纪律的必要性时指出：“应该向工人们，特别是向走进工厂不久的工人们解释，他们在行动中容许怠惰而不把劳动生产率推向前进，这就有害于共同事业，有害于工人阶级，有害于我们的工业。与怠惰斗争，提高劳动生产率，以利于我们的工业，利于整个工人阶级。任务就是如此。”
    联共党第十八次代表大会提出了完全消灭怠惰的任务。“党的组织--大会决议中讲道--职工会、工业及运输业的工作人员，必须在工业和运输业中进行巩固劳动纪律的不倦斗争。记着，与工人的流动和怠惰现象斗争的任务不是暂时性的运动，而是要在群众中进行的经常工作。”
    苏维埃社会要求全体人民按能力劳动。这就是说，每一个劳动人民应以其力量及能力的最大可能工作，利用工作时间的每一分钟进行生产，不要满足于完成任务，而要追求超过它。社会主义的纪律，列宁说这是“斗争中的自治的和自动的纪律”，这是在创造性的、被解放的劳动中的自觉的纪律。在社会主义制度之下，群众自己在实践斗争的过程中寻找及发现了新的最好的生产工作的方法，更有效的组织方法和巩固纪律性的方法。
    在工业中，斯达汉诺夫工作者的经验显示，充分利用工作日与劳动组织和技术的更趋完善，是其获得生产成绩的条件。斯达汉诺夫工作者，斯大林同志说，是有文化的，精通技术的人们，是能够看重工作中的时间因素，不仅以每分钟而且以每秒钟科学地计算时间的人们，是能够自动打毁旧的技术标准而创造新的更高的标准的人们。这一点也同样典型地描画出农业中的斯达汉诺夫工作者，在一九四七年在农耕和牧畜方面达到高额结果的社会主义劳动英雄，沃龙湟什省的“红十月”集体农庄中的集体农民表现了社会主义创造性劳动和组织性的鲜明的榜样，他们在一九四七年在一三一三公顷土地上，平均每公顷收获了一百普特粮食。为了极高的成果，苏联政府给这个农庄十一个庄员以社会主义劳动英雄的头衔。
    为了社会主义劳动纪律，为提高组织性的斗争，不能与劳动人民的发展创造性的主动性和社会主义竞赛分离开来。现在所进行着的社会主义竞赛的新高潮，是社会主义社会中劳动者自觉性和纪律性提高的明证。
    自然，开展教育工作，提高劳动中的创造自动性和竞赛，在巩固劳动纪律的斗争中，不是摈弃而是采用例如批评和自我批评这样有效的方法。因为愈发挥群众的创造积极性，个别忽视纪律的事情就不可能容忍，它就会遇到更多的劳动人民的斥责和愤懑。
    巩固纪律的斗争，与采取教育的方法和说服的方法一起，还应采用强制的方法--企业内部规章、农业合作社的规章和苏维埃的立法所规定的一切组织方法。列宁指出，反对无组织性和无纪律性的斗争，“不能够单以宣传和鼓动，单以组织竞赛，单以选拔组织者的方法进行，斗争也需要以强迫的方法进行。”（列宁全集二十二卷四六○页）
    每一个工作人员的组织性和纪律性，乃是企业以至整个国民经济中组织性巩固的必要条件。党要求不倦地加强生产中的纪律和秩序。在联共党十八次代表大会关于工业和运输业中党组织的任务问题的决定中，如下的问题成了基本注意的集中点：即建立生产中的秩序，与无计划的突击冷热病作斗争，在使用计划图表的工作中采用严格的技术的纪律，消灭懒汉，巩固企业中的集中制度和领导。所有这一切措施，都是为着巩固企业中的组织性和秩序并提高劳动文化的目的。这些措施的实行，在我们的经济发展中起着巨大的作用。
    苏维埃社会中劳动者的高度组织性和纪律性，是社会主义制度的优点之一。这个优点在社会主义的和平建设时期和在战时，都充分地得到了证明。组织的力量帮助苏维埃人民在战后克服残酷的战争所造成的困难，继续发展社会主义经济。但这也就是说为了更加成功地向前迈进，苏维埃人民应该更加提高自己的纪律和组织性，毫无保留地根除一切怠惰和目无秩序的成份。
    列宁和斯大林所培育出来的布尔什维克党，是组织性和纪律性的最高榜样。在布尔什维克的组织性的精神之下，我们党不倦地教育劳动人民，团结他们，用社会主义的纪律统一他们。布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府，领导着新社会的整个建设，而将组织性及纪律的基础，加入全国整个创造性的工作中。在伟大建设的每一部分，党和政府的组织动员和团结着劳动人民并引导他们的努力向着一致的目标--向着巩固我国的经济威力、建设完美的共产主义社会的目标前进。
