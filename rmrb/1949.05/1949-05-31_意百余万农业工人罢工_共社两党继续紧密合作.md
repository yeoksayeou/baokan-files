　　Over a Million Italian Agricultural Workers Strike
    Communist and Socialist Parties Continue Close Cooperation
    A large-scale strike involving over a million agricultural workers has broken out in Italy. Due to the Landowners' Association's refusal to negotiate with the General Confederation of Labour to sign a nationwide unified labor contract for agricultural workers, the Federation of Agricultural Workers and the Secretariat of the General Confederation of Labour announced a strike commencing on the 18th. Six hundred thousand agricultural workers in the Po River Valley and the Lazio province initiated the strike; two days later, the strike expanded to the central and southern provinces, with the number of strikers exceeding one million. During the strike, the landowners organized so-called "flying squads," transporting strikebreakers by automobile to various farms. However, in many areas, unemployed workers compelled to act as strikebreakers quickly formed brotherly solidarity with the striking agricultural workers. Landowners also murdered striking agricultural workers, instigating the police to arrest over a hundred workers. These atrocities aroused the working class's indignation. Workers throughout the province of Milan held a two-hour protest strike on the 21st. As of the 27th, the strike had persisted for ten days.
    At the 28th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, held on May 12th, a motion proposed by the left wing reaffirming close cooperation with the Communist Party was passed. The congress elected a leadership body without the participation of right-wing elements. Nenni, the left-wing leader who had been squeezed out by centrists and rightists at the 27th Congress last July, was elected as the party's General Secretary. This is a victory for progressive forces in Italy and a blow to the reactionary forces intent on dividing worker unity. The new leadership of the Italian Socialist Party announced in a letter to party members that it would resolutely struggle against the ruling party – the Christian Democratic Party and the Saragat Party – and against the policy of war using the North Atlantic Treaty as a weapon.

　　意百余万农业工人罢工
    共社两党继续紧密合作
    意大利发生百万以上农业工人的大罢工。由于地主联合会拒绝与总工会谈判为农业工人签订全国性的单一劳动合同，农业工人联合会和总工会书记处宣布于十八日开始罢工。波河流域和拉佐亚省的六十万农业工人，首先罢工；两天以后，罢工扩及中部与南部各省，罢工人数增至一百万人以上。在罢工中，地主组织所谓“飞行队”，用汽车载送罢工破坏者至各农场。但许多地区被驱使充任罢工破坏者的失业工人与罢工的农业工人，立刻结成了兄弟般的团结。地主并残杀罢工的农业工人，嗾使警察逮捕工人百余人。这种暴行，引起了工人阶级的义愤。米兰全省工人在二十一日举行了两小时的抗议罢工。迄二十七日止，罢工已坚持十天。
    在意大利社会党五月十二日举行的第二十八届代表大会上，左派提出的重申与共产党紧密合作的议案被通过。大会选出了没有右派分子参加的领导机关，在去年七月二十七届代表大会上被中派与右派排挤的左派领袖南尼，当选为该党总书记。这是意大利进步势力的一个胜利，和对于蓄意分裂工人团结的反动势力的一个打击。意大利社会党新的领导机构在告党员书中宣布，将坚决地对政府党--基督教民主党和萨拉盖特党进行斗争，对以北大西洋公约为武器的战争政策进行斗争。
