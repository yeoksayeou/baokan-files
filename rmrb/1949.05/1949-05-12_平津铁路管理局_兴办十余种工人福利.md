The Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau
Establishes Over Ten Types of Worker Welfare Programs

[This newspaper report] The Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau is actively establishing worker welfare programs, winning enthusiastic support from its employees. Since holding a worker symposium last month, the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau has, based on the opinions of worker representatives, successively implemented over ten types of worker welfare programs. These include free medical treatment at railway hospitals and clinics, and a coal allocation plan for employees in the spring. Recently, due to salary adjustments still pending, and to take care of the livelihood of employees with the lowest salaries, it was also stipulated that temporary living allowances be issued to those with base salaries below 27 yuan, and those with base salaries below 21 yuan whose millet income is less than 200 jin will all be subsidized to 200 jin. At the same time, welfare programs such as employee cultural and recreational activities, sports, consumer cooperatives, employee cafeterias, bathhouses, and mobile library services are being organized. This reporter interviewed employees specifically about this, and they expressed great satisfaction. Section Chief Tan said, "These regulations are great. In the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, only fourteen days of leave were allowed per year. Now, there is one day off every week. In the past, no one praised you for not taking a single day of leave, let alone reward you. Now it is stipulated that those who do not take leave for one year will be rewarded. Those who do not take leave for two years will receive a reward in addition to honorary recognition, as well as an extra month's salary bonus. Those who do not take leave for three years will receive a salary grade promotion in addition to honorary recognition." Regarding the regulations on children's education subsidies, Sun Quanxi, a boilermaker at the Beijing Rolling Stock Depot, said: "This regulation is very reasonable. In the past, under the Kuomintang, there was no subsidy for those attending primary school, and only subsidies for those attending secondary school and university. But those who could attend secondary school and university were all department-level or higher employees with high salaries. Workers' children could not even afford to attend primary school, so of course there were no subsidies. Now, the regulation stipulates that all children of those with monthly salaries below 72 yuan will receive full subsidies for attending primary school, which solves the difficulty of workers' children attending school. If they can attend primary school, they will be able to attend university in the future."

    平津铁路管理局
    兴办十余种工人福利
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局积极兴办工人福利事业，获得职工的热情拥护。平津铁路局自上月召开工人座谈会之后，根据工人代表的意见，先后举办工人福利事业十余种。如铁路医院及诊疗所免费诊病，春季员工用煤配给办法等。最近又因薪资尚未调整，为照顾薪资最低的职工生活，又规定了底薪在二十七元以下的发给临时生活补助费，凡底薪不足二十一元其所得小米不足二百斤者一律补助至二百斤。同时并举办职工文化娱乐、体育、消费合作社、员工食堂、浴室、巡回图书社等福利事业。记者特为此访问员工，他们表示十分满意。谭段长说：“这些规定就是好，过去在国民党反动派手里，一年只准休假十四天，现在每礼拜休假一天，过去一天不请假的也没人说好，更说不上奖励，现在规定一年不请假的给奖励，两年不请假的除名誉奖励之外，还多发一月工资奖金，三年不请假的除名誉奖励之外，还晋工资一级。”在子女教育补助费的规定上，北平车房锅炉工人孙全喜说：“这个规定很合理，过去国民党时规定上小学的不给补助，上中学、大学的才有补助，可是能上中学、大学的都是薪水高的处长级以上的职员，工人子女，连小学都上不起，当然就没有补助了。现在规定月薪在七十二元以下的子女上小学全部补助，就解决了工人子女上学的困难。能上小学将来就能上大学了。”
