　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 28th -- The people of northern Jiangsu contributed a great force in supporting the army's southern crossing operation. From February until before the crossing, the people of northern Jiangsu built a total of 5,290 li of highways and 197 bridges, paving the way for the army's southward advance. When the army crossed the river, 25,750 vessels of various sizes transported supplies and ammunition for the troops, with 62,100 full-time laborers accompanying the army on its southern expedition, and another 23,300 laborers serving on the riverbanks, supplying a total of 130 million catties of rice and flour and 110 million catties of straw, ensuring the smooth completion of the task of supporting the army's river-crossing operation. As early as the beginning of February, after the establishment of the Northern Jiangsu Frontline Support Headquarters, full mobilization was carried out among the people, and full material preparations were made. In mid-March, boatmen began to be concentrated for training. Through education, the boatmen's awareness was greatly improved. Taixing County, which is close to the river, had 250,000 people involved in the frontline support movement. Jiangdu County mobilized 2,653 boats, 2,050 carts, 20,000 full-time laborers, and more than 110,000 temporary laborers. In Taizhou City, 34,900 laborers set out, including 3,020 cadres at or below the county level and 3,056 Communist Party members. After the river crossing began, the boatmen and cadres showed even greater revolutionary heroism. Tian Shizhang and Yan Shengfu, boatmen from Jingjiang County, were old heroes who had been helping the New Fourth Army cross the river since 1939. This time, they participated in the forced crossing, braving enemy fire on the eight-li wide river, loading and transporting six to eight times a night, setting the highest transportation record. Wang Fengying, a seventeen-year-old female boatman from Hai'an County, bravely and skillfully broke through the encirclement of seven enemy ships during the forced crossing and successfully completed her mission. In the First River Crossing Headquarters alone, which had 2,200 ships under its command, 1,348 meritorious individuals emerged.

　　苏北人民支援南渡伟力
  　两月修路五千里
  　渡江船只两万五
    【新华社无锡二十八日电】苏北人民在支援大军南渡作战中，贡献了伟大的力量。自二月到渡江前，苏北各地人民共修筑了公路五千二百九十里，桥梁一百九十七座，为大军铺平了南进的道路。大军渡江时，有大小船两万五千七百五十只为部队运送给养弹药，有常备民工六万二千一百人随军南征，另有二万三千三百个民工在江边服务，先后供给了米面一万万三千万斤，草一万万一千万斤，保证了支援大军渡江作战任务的顺利完成。早在二月初，苏北支援前线司令部成立后，即在人民中作了充分的动员和在物质上作了充分的准备。三月中旬开始集中船工整训。经过教育，船工觉悟大大提高。紧靠江边的泰兴一县即有二十五万人卷入支援前线运动。江都县出动了船二千六百五十三只，小车二千零五十辆，常备民工二万余人，临时民工十一万余人。泰州市区出征民工三万四千九百人，其中有县以下各级干部三千零二十人、共产党员三千零五十六人。渡江开始后，各船工、干部更表现了高度的革命英雄主义。靖江县船工田世章和严声甫，是从一九三九年起即帮助新四军来往渡江的老英雄，这次参加强渡，在八里宽的江面上，冒着敌人的炮火一夜装送六次到八次，创造了运送的最高纪录。海安县十七岁的女船工王凤英，在强渡中，曾英勇机智地突破了七艘敌舰的包围，胜利完成任务。仅第一渡江司令部所辖二千二百条船中，即出现功臣一千三百四十八名。
