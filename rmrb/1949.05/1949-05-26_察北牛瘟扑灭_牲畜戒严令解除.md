　　Chabei Rinderpest Eradicated
  　Livestock Curfew Lifted
    [Chahar News] After the outbreak of rinderpest in Chabei, the Chahar Provincial People's Government instructed the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office to immediately designate epidemic areas, issue a livestock curfew, block traffic around the epidemic areas, prohibit cattle from traveling to and from the area, and strictly isolate the affected area in order to prevent the spread of rinderpest. Now that the rinderpest in Chabei has been eradicated, the Chahar Provincial People's Government has announced the lifting of the livestock curfew. From May 10th, the inland cattle carts and cattle trade can proceed smoothly, and the Ping-Sui Railway will also resume livestock transportation. However, the rinderpest in various Mongolian banners of Inner Mongolia is still very serious, and it must continue to be sealed off.

　　察北牛瘟扑灭
  　牲畜戒严令解除
    【察哈尔讯】察北发生牛瘟后，察省人民政府为防止牛瘟蔓延扩大，曾指示察北专署立即划定疫区，颁发牲畜戒严令，并在疫区周围遮断交通，禁止牛只往来，严行隔绝。现因察北牛瘟已告扑灭，察省人民政府宣布解除牲畜戒严令，自五月十日起，内地牛车来往与牛只贩运即可畅行，平绥路同时亦恢复牲畜运输。但内蒙各蒙旗牛瘟因仍很严重，尚须继续封锁。　　　　　　　　　（耀斌）
