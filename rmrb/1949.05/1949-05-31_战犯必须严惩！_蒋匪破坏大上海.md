Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 29th: Under the command of war criminals Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, Gui Yongqing, Shi Jue, Chen Daqing and others, the Kuomintang bandit army in Shanghai frantically sabotaged Shanghai's important industries, ships, warehouses, and weapons. The Jiangnan Shipyard, the largest in the country, was largely destroyed. All shipping companies in Shanghai were forced to destroy all their ships. Those already destroyed include the Yonghan, Yong Sheng, Yong Tao, and Yong Luo oil tankers of the China Oil Tanker Company, and more than ten ships including the Minyu, Minben, Minwan of the Minsheng Company, and the Jiangchang of the joint operation of the Dada and Datong companies. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army advanced rapidly, and most of the remaining ships were preserved. The gasoline depot at Jiangwan Airport, the ammunition depots at Wusong and Maqiao, and all equipment at Hongqiao Airport were also burned down. The Kuomintang bandit army retreating from Wusong burned nearly a thousand vehicles, armored vehicles, etc., fully loaded with ammunition and supplies, and nearby warehouses on the highway south of the Yunzaobing Bridge. The fire lasted from the 25th to 10 pm on the 26th. The bandit army also wantonly looted villages within dozens of miles of the suburbs. In the western suburbs of Shanghai, east of Hongqiao Airport and south of the Suzhou River, flames soared into the sky every day for half a month. Hundreds of villages were reduced to rubble. The bandit army in Pudong tied up more than 200 male and female residents of Dongdingjiazhai in Yangjing Town and burned down all 65 houses in the village. The two-month-old infant of villager Ding Yiping was burned to death in the house because his parents were tied up and taken away. The western section of the foreign residential area on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai is also full of scorched earth, rubble, and fallen tree trunks. The school headquarters and most student dormitories of Fudan University, and the doors, windows, tables, chairs, beds, and lights of the Tongji University dormitories were all torn down. The power lines and furniture of Jiaotong University were also destroyed.
