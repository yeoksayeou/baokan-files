(Jinan Electric Dispatch) In some villages in Pingyuan County, landlords and rich peasants have violated government decrees and counterattacked the peasants, sabotaging production. The People's Government has dealt with them separately according to the law. With the victorious development of the military situation and the successive liberation of cities, more and more landlords and old rich peasants who had previously evaded the peasants' reckoning have returned home. Our People's Government has implemented a lenient policy and resettled them according to the Land Law Outline. However, some landlords and old rich peasants still refuse to bow their heads to the peasant masses, obey the decrees of the People's Government, and engage in production; they even dare to spread rumors and intimidate the masses. For example, Liu Zhaoyan, a landlord from Zaoliuzhuang, returned home from Jinan this spring. He has not registered with the government for a long time, forcibly moved into a house that had been distributed to the peasants, and privately used the farmers' association's bricks and tiles, and even declared that the village would not allow him to vacate his house; Wang Daoyi, a landlord from Xinzhang Village, forcibly sold two of the three rooms that had been allocated to military dependents; and Feng Lianting, a rich peasant, cut down trees belonging to the farmers' association and stole two gates from the farmers' association. Yang Yunjian, a rich peasant from Wangmingzhuang, unreasonably demanded the return of sixteen mu of land, a millstone, a cart, and clothing that had been returned to the peasants; Wang Yansan, an old rich peasant from Beiqiuzhuang, took back the cattle that had been returned to the peasants. The county government has taken effective measures to deal with the above-mentioned illegal and destructive behaviors of landlords and rich peasants, detained six of the main culprits for trial, and, based on the severity of the crimes, solicited the opinions of the peasant masses and criticized or dealt with other landlords and old rich peasants in accordance with the law.

    平原有些地主
    违法破坏生产
    【冀南电】平原县有些村庄，地主富农违犯政府法令向农民反攻，破坏生产，人民政府已分别依法处理。随着军事形势的胜利发展，城市相继解放，以往逃避农民清算的地主、旧富农还家的日多。我人民政府施以宽大政策，按土地法大纲进行安置，但有部分地主、旧富农，仍不向农民群众低头，服从人民政府法令，从事生产；竟敢造谣生事，威迫群众。比如早刘庄地主刘兆彦今春由济南回家，长期不去到政府登记，硬搬到农民已分的房里住，又私自动用农会砖瓦，并扬言村里不给他腾他房不行；辛章村地主王道一把已经分给军属的三间房架，又强行卖去两间；富农冯连廷截伐农会树木，偷农会两付大门。王明庄富农杨云检把退还农民的十六亩地，一盘粉磨、一辆大车、衣物等又无理要回去；北邱庄旧富农王彦三把退还农民的牛又牵回去，该县政府，对上述地主富农的违法破坏行为，已采取有效办法分别予以处理，将首要罪恶分子六人扣押候审，对其他地主、旧富农，按犯罪之轻重，征求农民群众意见，分别根据法令予以批评或处理。
