Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 30th. The output of the three major state-owned coal mines in Mentougou is increasing daily. In early April, the average daily coal production per worker in the Mentougou Coal Mine was 1.16 tons, breaking the 30-year coal mining record. In mid-April, the production was 1.19 tons, surpassing the record set in early April. A surge to become labor model is currently underway throughout the mine. The three shifts of the 14th production team are collectively competing, guaranteeing the quantity of coal produced. Sun Guoqi, a worker in the mountain machinery room, took the lead in increasing production, producing twelve tons of pig iron in two months, more than double the six tons produced every two months before liberation. The Xishan Coal Mine was affected by power outages, producing only more than 2,500 tons in early April. All employees immediately launched a "recover 800 tons" campaign, and finally produced 980 tons more in mid-April, exceeding the planned increase. Under the leadership of veteran worker Qin Honghai, the output of the ninth production team increased daily. The output in mid-April increased by 253 tons compared to early April, and the output in the first five days of late April was more than half of the output in mid-April. The miners not only want to complete the April coal production plan of 9,000 tons, but also strive to exceed the plan by 1,000 tons. The average daily output of the Chengzhi Coal Mine in early April was more than 110 tons, with each worker producing 0.742 tons per day, breaking the mine's record since it started operation last year. In mid-April, the daily output of the entire mine increased to 172 tons, and each worker's daily output increased to 0.775 tons, again breaking the record set in early April. The mine has also made significant progress in saving materials. On average, the mine used 0.18 kilograms of explosives and 1.55 detonators per ton of coal mined in early April, while in mid-April, it used 0.16 kilograms of explosives and 1.44 detonators. The best-performing units used only 0.12 kilograms of explosives and 1.27 detonators. Three months ago, in January before liberation, the entire mine used an average of 0.26 kilograms of explosives and 2.45 detonators per ton of coal mined.

    门头沟三大国营煤矿
    煤产量逐日在增加
    打破了三十年来的采煤纪录
    【新华社北平三十日电】门头沟三大国营煤矿产量逐日提高。门头沟煤矿井下工人四月上旬平均每人每天采煤一·一六吨，打破了三十年来的采煤纪录；中旬采一·一九吨，又突破了上旬纪录。现全矿正展开争取劳动模范的热潮。井下第十四生产小组的三个班正在集体挑战，保证出煤数量。山上机器房工人孙国起带头增产，两个月出生铁十二吨，超过解放前每两月出六吨一倍。西山煤矿因受停电影响，上旬只产了二千五百多吨，全体职工当即展开“抢回八百吨”运动，中旬终于多产了九百八十吨，超过了预定增产计划。第九生产组在老工人秦鸿海领导之下，产量逐日增加。中旬比上旬增产二百五十三吨，下旬的前五天又比中旬产量的一半还多。该矿工人不仅要完成四月份出煤九千吨的计划，并且争取超过计划出煤一千吨。城子煤矿上旬平均日产一百十余吨，每个工人每天产○·七四二吨，打破了该矿自去年开工以来的纪录。中旬全矿日产增加到一百七十二吨，每个工人每天增产到○·七七五吨，又突破上旬纪录。该矿在节省材料方面也有显著进步。全矿平均采一吨煤，在上旬用○·一八公斤炸药和一·五五个雷管，中旬则用○·一六公斤炸药和一·四四个雷管。成绩最好的单位，更只用○·一二公斤炸药和一·二七个雷管。而在三个月以前，即解放前的一月份内，则全矿每采一吨煤平均要用○·二六公斤炸药和二·四五个雷管。
