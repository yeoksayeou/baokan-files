　　Mayor Ye Jianying's Welcome Speech
　　Fellow compatriots! Today, let me represent everyone, and also represent the more than two million people of Beiping City, to welcome our delegation back to Beiping safely and victoriously. We welcome the fact that although the peace delegation suffered obstruction from the reactionary French government, it was still able to speak frankly and clearly about what the Chinese people wanted to say to the people of the world at the World Peace Congress, making the people of the world clearly aware that the liberated Chinese people not only have the sincerity to uphold world peace, but also have the powerful strength to uphold peace.
　　All representatives of the Peace Delegation! You expressed to the people of the world that the people's revolution carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and its victory, made a great contribution to human peace; you publicized the heroic achievements of the People's Liberation Army and announced the demise of the reactionary Nanjing government headed by Chiang Kai-shek; today you have returned victoriously to Beiping, and have brought back to our people the harmonious, enthusiastic, and united spirit of the world's peace and democracy camp, giving us faith that the world's peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union will definitely be able to crush any conspiracy by imperialists to provoke a new war.
　　Fellow compatriots! Today is a welcome meeting, and also a celebration meeting. We should now celebrate the success of the World Peace Congresses held simultaneously in Paris and Prague in April. The 2,005 representatives at the congresses, representing more than 800 million people from 72 countries, unanimously demanded to consolidate and expand the peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union, resolutely oppose the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke a third world war, oppose the frenzied expansion of armaments, oppose the obstruction of normal economic relations between countries, oppose the new fascism that seeks to dominate the world, respect the independence and sovereignty of all countries, and establish a permanent organization to establish branches in all countries participating in the congress, to promote the work of striving for world peace to cities and villages around the world. Such a successful congress undoubtedly dealt a great blow to those who provoke world war and gave great encouragement to the people around the world who uphold peace and democracy. We call on all the people of Beiping to use their loyalty and strength to resolutely support all the decisions and measures adopted by the World Peace Congress. Let us shout: Long live the victory of world peace and democracy!
