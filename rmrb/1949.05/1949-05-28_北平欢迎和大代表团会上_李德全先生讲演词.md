Speech by Mr. Li Dequan at the Beiping Welcome Reception for the Delegation to the World Congress of Partisans for Peace

(From Our Correspondent in this city) Li Dequan, a representative of the Chinese delegation who attended the victorious World Congress of Partisans for Peace and returned home, delivered a speech at the Beiping welcome rally on the 25th. The original text is as follows:

Dear Comrades:

Since our delegation returned from Manzhouli, we have been warmly welcomed by many comrades along the way. Today, we are being so warmly welcomed by the comrades in Beiping. We feel indescribably moved. Here, we extend our warmest greetings to you all!

Our comrades have all said in unison, "Welcome the victorious return of our delegation." We really feel ashamed, because we have not exerted much effort. But we have indeed returned victoriously. This victory is the victory of the people, the victory of the People's Liberation Army, the victory of the Chinese Communist Party's years of struggle, and the victory of the correct leadership of the Chinese people's leader, Mr. Mao Zedong!

This time, when the delegation attended the World Congress of Partisans for Peace, as soon as we arrived in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, and went to the French embassy to complete the formalities for going to Paris to sign the documents, the French imperialist embassy only allowed eight of our representatives to enter. This unreasonable restriction was not only directed at China, but also at the new democratic countries such as Hungary and Poland, as well as the socialist country of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Chinese delegation was subjected to other coercions, namely, attempting to use this to force our Chinese People's Government to recognize the diplomatic status of French imperialism. The Chinese People's Delegation represents the interests of the people, and the Chinese People's Government does not recognize it, so our delegation certainly cannot recognize it. Although French imperialism used various means of deception, the Chinese People's Delegation resolutely stood by the will of the people and did not go to Paris, but opened the World Congress of Partisans for Peace in Prague with other representatives who could not attend in Paris. This Prague Peace Congress can be said to be a manifestation of the victory of the people's struggle.

The imperialists, headed by U.S. imperialism, originally wanted to hinder the unity of the peace-loving people of the world. But reactionary executioners, you must know that besides a very small number of lackeys who are willing to be imperialists, which of the majority of the people, not to mention socialist countries, new democratic countries, and colonial and semi-colonial countries, does not love peace?! Look at Wallace and other progressive people in the United States, they are all fighting for world peace. They say, "The North Atlantic Treaty is a threat to themselves and their children, and it is a destruction of their prosperity, freedom, and life." Then look at Hutchison, a Labour Party member in Britain who followed U.S. imperialism, who said, "The general pure people need world unity and need peace. The British people do not want war, and will not fight for reactionaries and big capitalists. We must support the World Congress of Partisans for Peace and decide to do everything possible to realize the principles of the Congress declaration. We are ready and determined to fight for the victory of peace and survival."

Comrades, look at the ardent hopes of peace-loving people all over the world for our Chinese people: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people bravely defeated Chiang Kai-shek for peace, and defeated all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism in China. Therefore, the sisters of the Soviet Union expressed their joy at the struggle of Chinese women, the women of the new democratic countries expressed their admiration for us, and the women of the colonies hoped that the Chinese people's revolution would be successful soon, and they would soon be liberated.

Peace will surely be victorious, as long as we are under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the bastion of peace for the world's people, and under the leadership of Stalin, the teacher of peaceful peoples, the peace of the world is certainly guaranteed. We must shout to the people of the whole world:

Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

### 北平欢迎和大代表团会上　李德全先生讲演词

　　北平欢迎和大代表团会上
  　李德全先生讲演词
    【本市讯】出席世界拥护和平大会胜利归国的中国代表团李德全代表，二十五日在北平欢迎大会上讲演，原词如下：
    亲爱的同胞们：
    我们代表团这次归来，从满洲里起，一路承蒙很多同胞们热烈地欢迎，今天又蒙北平市的同胞这样地热烈欢迎，真是有说不出来的亲切。我们在这里向诸位致最亲爱的敬礼！
    我们的同胞们都异口同声的说：“欢迎我们代表团胜利归来”，我们实在感觉到惭愧，因为我们并没有尽了多少力量。但我们确实是胜利归来，这个胜利是人民的胜利，是人民解放军的胜利，是中国共产党多少年奋斗的胜利，是中国人民领袖毛泽东先生领导正确的胜利！
    这次代表团出席世界拥护和平大会，刚到了捷克的首都布拉格，向法国使馆办理去巴黎签字的手续时，法帝国主义使馆只许我们八位代表入境。这种无理的限制，不但对中国，也对新民主主义的国家如匈牙利、波兰等及社会主义的国家苏联，亦都如此。同时对中国代表团更有另外的要挟，就是企图借此叫我们中国人民政府承认法帝国主义的外交地位。中国人民代表团是代表人民利益的，中国人民政府不承认的事情，我们代表团当然绝不能承认它。法帝国主义虽采用了种种诱骗的手段，但中国人民代表团坚决地站在人民意志之下，不去巴黎，而同其他不能出席巴黎的代表，就在布拉格开世界拥护和平大会。这个布拉格和平大会，可以说是人民斗争胜利的表现。
    以美帝为首的帝国主义者们，本想阻碍爱好和平的世界人民团结在一起。但反动的刽子手们，你们要知道：除了很少数的甘心做帝国主义者的走狗外，那大多数的人民，不要说社会主义的国家、新民主主义的国家、殖民地及半殖民地的国家，就是你们帝国主义国家的人民，那一位不是爱好和平的呢！？看一看美国的华莱士和一般进步的人士，他们都在为世界和平而奋斗。他们说：“北大西洋公约对他们自己和他们的儿女是一种威胁，对于他们的繁荣、自由、生命是一种毁灭。”再看一看跟着美帝国主义走的英国的一位工党党员赫金生说：“一般纯洁的人民需要世界团结，需要和平。英国人民不要战争，不为反动派及大资本家打仗，我们要支持世界拥护和平大会，决定尽一切努力去实现大会宣言的原则，我们已准备并决心争取为和平与生存而斗争的胜利。”
    同胞们再看看全世界爱好和平者对我们中国人民的热望：中国人民在毛主席领导之下英勇地为和平打垮了蒋介石，打垮了美帝国主义在中国的一切阴谋，因此，苏联的姊妹们对中国妇女们的奋斗表示欣慰，新民主主义国家的妇女们对我们表示敬佩，殖民地的妇女们希望着中国人民的革命迅速成功，而她们也就快要得到解放。
    和平一定会胜利的，只要我们在世界人民的和平堡垒--苏联领导下，和平人民的导师斯大林领导下，世界的和平决定是有保障的。我们要向全世界的人民高呼：
    中国人民解放万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁！
