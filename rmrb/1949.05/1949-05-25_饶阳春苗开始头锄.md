[Hebei Central Electric] The Raoyang spring seedlings have begun their first weeding. More than thirty villages in the county suffered little or no harvest last year due to flooding; many wheat crops were planted after the flood receded. This spring, due to the wet ground, some barley and peas were planted during the Spring Equinox; after the Qingming Festival, autumn fields continued to be sown. The sowing work is now basically completed, and some spring seedlings are already three inches high, and farmers have begun summer weeding. Subsidiary production in these disaster areas mainly involves weaving pockets, boiling saltpeter, and making military uniforms. To strengthen leadership, the county party committee specially convened a district secretary meeting, which decided that the main tasks at present are weeding in agriculture, continuing to eliminate barren land, and completing the work of protecting wheat in combination. In terms of subsidiary production, the pocket industry should continue to be developed; publicize the cessation of purchasing saltpeter and help saltpeter workers gradually change jobs. To this end, women should be mobilized to participate in weeding. Consolidate the militia organization, register firearms and ammunition, conduct detailed inspections, and prevent and suppress bad elements from stealing, gambling, and other behaviors that hinder production, laying the foundation for protecting wheat.

　　饶阳春苗开始头锄
    【冀中电】饶阳春苗开始头锄。该县三十多个村庄去年被水灾后收成无几；水脱后耩的麦子很多。今春由于地湿，春分节里种了些大麦和豌豆；清明节后又继续播种秋田。现播种工作基本完成，有些春苗现已三寸高，农民已开始夏锄。这些灾区的副业生产，多是织口袋、熬硝、和做军装。为加强领导，县委特召开区书会议，决定当前的主要工作，农业上是锄苗，继续消灭白地，结合完成护麦准备工作。副业上是继续发展口袋业；宣传停收火硝，帮助硝民逐渐转业。为此发动妇女应参加锄苗。整顿组织民兵，进行枪支子弹登记，详细的检查、制止与镇压坏分子偷盗赌博等障碍生产的行为，打下护麦基础。
