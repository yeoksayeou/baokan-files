    Congress Declaration
    The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has basically come to its demise, and the liberation of all of China is not far off. The chains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that were imposed on the heads of all Chinese people have been completely shattered. The remnants of the semi-colonial, dilapidated, and impoverished old China are being submerged in the roaring waves of the people's great liberation. At a time when this New Democratic China is being born, and when the Chinese people's great revolution, one of the most significant events in human history since the 20th century, is about to achieve nationwide victory, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation is declaring its establishment on this year's Chinese Youth Day – the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. Under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation will unite all democratic youth in the country, all patriotic youth who oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, regardless of differences in class, party affiliation, political belief, religious belief, ethnicity, occupation, and gender, to carry the Chinese people's great revolution through to the end, to build a new industrialized, New Democratic China from an agricultural China. It calls on and organizes young people to learn from our great mentor, Mao Zedong, to master the scientific knowledge and technology of industrial and agricultural production, to grasp the new outlook on life and advanced theories of the working people, and to closely link the cause of New Democratic construction of Chinese youth with the common cause of world lasting peace and people's democracy, and advance bravely.
    In the past thirty years, under the guidance of the great mentor Mao Zedong, Chinese youth have experienced many tests. We have learned how to seize the weapons supplied by American imperialism to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang to arm ourselves, establish the people's army, navy, and air force. We have learned how to thoroughly overthrow the deeply entrenched feudal land system to distribute land to the peasants. We have learned how to establish the people's new industry with miraculous perseverance under difficult conditions, and to take over, restore, develop, and transform the enterprises of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie into New Democratic state enterprise sectors. At the same time, we have also learned how to closely unite the productive forces of all classes of people, including workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie, to gradually transform consuming cities into productive cities. In a word, the Chinese people are brave and industrious, and Chinese youth are also brave and industrious, and are full of vigor, courageous, daring, good at learning, striving for progress, and keenly accepting new things. We will not be overwhelmed by the joy of revolutionary victory. We will strive to maintain the traditional virtues of frugality and hard work that we have accumulated in the countryside over the past twenty years. We will work hard and start a business diligently, and we are confident and have a step-by-step plan to build our motherland. We have the largest population in the world, we have fertile land, we have iron, coal, abundant oil, unlimited mineral and agricultural raw materials, and we have the most reliable guarantee, which is the leadership of Mao Zedong, who will carry the Chinese people's great revolution through to the final victory. We also have the enthusiastic support of the broad people of the world's democratic camp. We declare with full confidence that, based on the above, Chinese youth will certainly be able to fulfill their historical mission.
    Our future is bright, but the historical mission we shoulder will be extremely arduous. As Mao Zedong warned us, we have only taken "the first step of the Long March." The imbalance in the development of the national economy caused by years of dark rule by imperialism and the landlord-bureaucrat bourgeoisie, the long-term poisoning of feudal consciousness and backward superstition, the low level of people's cultural level, the deception of imperialist enslavement education, and the temptation of the corrupt and hedonistic atmosphere remaining in the cities are all serious obstacles on our way forward. In order to overcome these obstacles, on the one hand, we require our youth to resolutely fight to complete the task, and require our youth to strive for progress in production skills, cultural knowledge, political understanding, and theoretical cultivation. On the other hand, we require us to unite the broadest possible range of democratic youth and patriotic youth across the country, and strive to participate in the solemn cause of building a New Democratic country.
    We call on all youth organizations, young scientific and artistic workers, and people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings who are willing to work together to build a new democratic New China to unite into the big family of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation.
    The Chinese people and Chinese youth are writing an earth-shattering page in Chinese history and world history. We want to create a happier and more fulfilling future for our young generation through our hands.
    Youth of the whole country, unite!
    Advance under the banner of Mao Zedong!

    大会宣言
    国民党反动统治已基本上归于灭亡，全中国的解放已为期不远。帝国主义和封建主义、官僚资本主义套在全中国人民头上的锁链，已彻底打碎，半殖民地的，残破而贫弱的旧中国的残迹，正在淹没在人民大翻身的惊涛骇浪中间。在这新民主主义的中国正在诞生，二十世纪以来，人类历史上最重大事变之一的中国人民大革命即将取得全国胜利的时候，中华全国民主青年联合总会，在今年的中国青年节——“五四”三十周年宣告成立。中华全国民主青年联合总会将在中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东的领导底下，把全国一切民主青年，一切反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的爱国青年，不分阶级、党派、政治信仰、宗教信仰、民族、职业和性别的差异，紧紧地团结起来，为着将中国人民大革命进行到底，将农业的中国建设为工业化的新民主主义的新中国，号召和组织青年学习我们伟大的导师毛泽东，掌握工业农业生产的科学知识和技术，把握劳动人民的新人生观和先进的理论，将中国青年的新民主主义建设事业和世界持久和平人民民主的共同事业紧密地联紧在一起，英勇前进。
    中国青年三十年来，在伟大导师毛泽东的指示之下，曾经经历过多次的考验。我们学会了如何将美帝国主义供给国民党反动统治的武器夺过来武装自己，建立人民的陆空海军，学会了如何将根深蒂固的封建土地制度彻底推翻来把土地分配给农民，学会了如何以奇迹式的毅力，在困难的条件下建立起人民的新工业，并将官僚资产阶级的企业加以接管，恢复，发展和改造为新民主主义的国家企业部门，同时也学会了怎样紧密地团结各阶层人民包括工人、农民、中小资产阶级的生产力量，将消费的城市逐步地改建为生产的城市。一句话说，中国人民是勇敢的，勤劳的，中国青年也是勇敢的，勤劳的，而且是富于朝气，奋勇无畏，敢作敢为，善于学习，努力于进步，敏锐地接受新鲜事物的。我们将不为革命的胜利的欢欣冲昏头脑，我们将努力地保持我们二十年来在乡村中积累下来的节俭刻苦的传统美德，我们将辛苦经营，勤勉起家，有信心有步骤地建设自己的祖国。我们具有全世界最多的人口，我们拥有肥沃的土地，我们有铁，有煤，有丰富的石油，有无限量的矿藏和农业原料，我们具有最可凭倚的保证，那就是将中国人民大革命贯彻到最后胜利的毛泽东的领导。我们还拥有全世界民主阵营的广大人民的热烈支持。我们以充分的自信宣告，以上面种种为依据，中国青年是一定能够完成自己历史使命的。
    我们的前途是光明的，但是我们所肩荷的历史使命将是异常艰巨的。正如毛泽东告诫我们的一样，我们仅仅是跨出了“万里长征的第一步”。由于多年来帝国主义和地主官僚资产阶级黑暗统治所造成的国民经济发展的不平衡，封建意识和落后迷信的长期毒害，人民文化水平的不高，帝国主义奴化教育的欺骗，都市中残存的腐化享乐气氛的诱惑，这都是我们前进道上的严重障碍。为了克服这些障碍，一方面要求我们青年坚决地为完成任务而奋斗，要求我们青年在生产技能上，文化知识上，政治认识上，理论修养上力求进步，另一方面要求我们最广泛地团结全国一切民主青年，爱国青年，努力参加建设新民主主义的庄严事业。
    我们号召凡愿意为建设新民主主义新中国而共同努力的所有青年团体，青年的科学艺术工作者和热心社会事业的人们都团结到中华全国民主青年联合总会的大家庭里来。
    中国人民和中国青年正在写中国历史和世界历史上惊天动地的一页。我们要经过我们的手，给我们自己年青的一代创造更幸福，更美满的将来。
    全国青年团结起来啊！
    在毛泽东的旗帜下前进！
