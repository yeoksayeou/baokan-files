    Good News for Handicraft Workers
    Cotton Yarn Can Be Exchanged for Socks
    [This Newspaper Reports] The Beijing Trading Company's Department Store Branch, in order to help small and medium-sized handicraft production and promote product sales, is exchanging a large amount of cotton yarn for finished products such as socks and towels. Since the company started the exchange program, according to recent statistics for twenty-five days, exchanges with general small handicraft industries or family handicrafts have been the most numerous, accounting for 60 percent of all exchange households, while medium-sized specialized households account for 30 percent. Larger factories that have signed similar exchange contracts account for only 10 percent. The company previously discovered that some handicrafts were adulterated or made damp. To prevent this and improve product quality, and to reward superior finished products, it is stipulated that 96 taels of socks can be exchanged for one bundle of 20-count yarn (one bundle equals 144 taels). If finished products are woven with 32-count yarn, 60 taels of socks can be exchanged for one bundle. According to the company's calculations, with such exchanges, producers can often obtain an average profit of 10 percent, which is good news for small producers. Now, several handicraft households scattered throughout Beijing are requesting the company to set up branches in Xicheng and other places.
    [Another Report] According to statistics for the 28th alone, the Department Store Branch exchanged 1,349 dozens and 4 pairs of socks, and 1,207 dozens and 3 towels, with 422 bundles of cotton yarn exchanged. (Yue Li)

    手工业者喜讯
    棉纱可换袜子
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司百货分公司为帮助中小手工业生产推销产品，特以大量棉纱交换袜子毛巾等成品。该公司自开始交换以来，据最近二十五天统计，与一般小手工业或家庭手工业交换最多，计达全部交换户的百分之六十，而对中等专业户则占百分之三十，较大的工厂订立类似交换合同者，为数仅占百分之十。该公司前曾发现部份手工业，有掺假使潮者，今为防止并提高产品质量，奖励优等成品，规定袜子九十六两可换二十支纱一捆（一捆等于一四四两），如以三十二支纱织的成品，以袜子六十两换一捆。据该公司计算，如此交换，生产者平均利润经常可获百分之十，这是小生产者的一个喜讯。现在，若干散住平市的手工业户要求该公司在西城等地设立分处。
    【又讯】据二十八日一天统计，百货分公司换入袜子一三四九打又四双，毛巾一二○七打又三条，换出之棉纱为四二二捆。（岳立）
