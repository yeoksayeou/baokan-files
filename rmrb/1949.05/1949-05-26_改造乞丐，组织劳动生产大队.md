　　Transforming Beggars, Organizing Labor Production Brigades
　　The labor production brigade of Beijing Municipality has departed to repair the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Such teams will be successively organized in newly liberated cities in North China to provide labor reform opportunities for the population stranded in cities with labor but without proper occupations—mainly beggars.
　　Who wants to be a beggar? Only the economic bankruptcy caused by reactionary rulers deprived them of the opportunity to work, leading them to wander the streets and beg for a living. However, some, having become accustomed to begging, are content with a parasitic life of begging. Therefore, the People's Government needs to take them in, organize them, reform them through education, and enlighten them to participate in labor production. One of the best methods is to organize such labor production brigades, using the principle of "work in place of payment," to participate in various engineering constructions or reclamation production.
　　This organization must adhere to the principles of labor, reform, education, and unity.
　　The so-called labor reform means transforming through labor, transforming into laborers. From the perspective of labor discipline, it must be strict and compulsory. Otherwise, it would be difficult to change a group of people who are accustomed to a loose parasitic life, and some may escape back to the city and continue begging. However, the government's purpose in adopting compulsory labor is precisely for their own sake, to cultivate their labor habits and enable them to support themselves. This is one of the fundamental differences between the labor production teams organized by the People's Government and the forced labor done by the enemy puppets or the Kuomintang era. Each newly liberated city must have a clear understanding of this point when organizing such brigades and explain it clearly to each member.
　　However, we must also pay attention to education and unity. The organizers and leaders of the labor production brigade, from the brigade leader to the squad leader, must live and work with the team members, avoid creating opposition and estrangement, and not adopt a supervisory attitude. Instead, they must enthusiastically help them, move them, and constantly educate them. Internal life must also have a certain degree of democracy, and they should be utilized as much as possible to manage themselves. In a situation where cadres are scarce in various places, using honorary soldiers to engage in this work has proven successful, but the honorary soldiers must first undergo training to understand the importance of this work and many methods of managing and transforming beggars.
　　The principle we use is "work in place of payment." Since it is payment, there will always be some financial expenditure, such as paying wages when working and providing food when transferring jobs. However, we must not foster a sense of being granted favor, as if they are here to eat relief food, but cultivate a sense of self-sufficiency in production. For example, for the replenishment of their clothing, the government will first lend it to them, but they must repay it without interest from their wages. What the government focuses on is not recovering a little clothing, but cultivating a spirit of self-reliance.

### 改造乞丐，组织劳动生产大队

　　改造乞丐，组织劳动生产大队
    北平市的劳动生产大队，出发到冀鲁豫修黄河去了。这样的队伍，将陆续在华北各新解放城市组织，以使流落在城市有劳动力而无正当职业的人口--主要是乞丐，得到劳动改造的机会。
    人谁愿当乞丐？只因反动统治者所造成的经济破产，使其得不到劳动的机会，才致流落街头，行乞度日，但有的要饭要惯了以后，却又苟安于乞讨的寄生生活，因之人民政府需要把他们加以收容组织，改造教育，启发其觉悟，使之参加劳动生产，其中最好的办法之一，就是组织这种劳动生产大队，依以工代帐的原则，去参加各种工程建设，或开垦生产。
    这种组织必须以劳动、改造、教育、团结为方针。
    所谓劳动改造，就是从劳动中去改造，改造成劳动者。从劳动纪律上说，必须是严格的，带有强制性的，不如此，则一群过惯了散漫的寄生生活的人，很难改变过来，而且有的可能逃还城市，依然行乞。但政府所以采用强制劳动的目的，正是为他们自己着想的，使他们养成劳动习惯，能够自食其力。这就是人民政府所组织的劳动生产队和敌伪时代或国民党时代抓劳力作苦工的基本区别之一，这一点，各新解放城市在组织此种大队时，必须有明确的认识，并且要和每一个队员解释清楚。
    然而我们又必须注意教育和团结，劳动生产大队的组织者和领导者，从大队长到班长，都必须和队员们生活打成一片，不要造成对立和隔阂，不要采取监工的态度，而必须热情的帮助他们，感动他们，经常的教育他们，内部的生活，也必须有一定的民主，尽量利用他们自己管理自己，在各地干部非常缺乏的情况之下，用荣誉军人来从事这一工作，证明是成功的，但对于荣军先要有一番训练，使他们了解这一工作的重要性，以及如何管理与改造乞丐的许多办法。
    我们所用的原则是以工代帐，既然是帐，财政上总要开支一些，如作工时给予工资，调动工作时仍然予以伙食的供给，但却不可养成恩赐观点，似乎是来吃救济饭的，而要养成生产自给的观点，如对于他们被服的补充，政府先行贷给，却要他们从工资中无利偿还，政府所着眼的并不是收回一点被服，而是一种自食其力的思想的养成。
