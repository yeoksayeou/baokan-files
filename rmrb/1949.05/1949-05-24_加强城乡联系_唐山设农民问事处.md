　　Strengthening Urban-Rural Ties
  　Tangshan Establishes Farmers' Affairs Office
    [Tangshan Electric] To strengthen urban-rural ties, Tangshan City established a "Farmers' Affairs Office" in early April, providing great convenience to farmers in the surrounding countryside. In April, the office answered questions a total of 173 times. Those seeking information included farmers from the countryside, as well as family members of soldiers and workers, urban workers, students, staff members, and revolutionary soldiers. Most inquiries concerned the location and procedures for selling agricultural products transported from the countryside, and the location and routes for visiting their children in the various field armies. The office provided detailed information or directions in each case. Farmers from Diantuo in Lu'an County's Fifth District brought grain but were unable to sell it after staying at the Baohe Inn for two days. The office then introduced them to the Fengnian Freight Station to help them sell it.

　　加强城乡联系
  　唐山设农民问事处
    【唐山电】为了加强城乡联系，唐山市四月初成立“农民问事处”，给四乡农民很大便利。四月份问事处共解答问题一百七十三次。问事者除了来自乡下的农民及军属、工属外，还有本市工人、学生、职员及革命军人等。多系询问由乡下运来农产品出卖的地点及手续，和去各野战军看子弟的地点、路线等。问事处都一一详告或指给其关系。滦县五区店坨农民拉来粮食，在宝合栈住了两天，无法出卖，问事处便给介绍到丰年货栈帮助出卖。
