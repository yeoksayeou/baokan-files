Question and Answer

　　How to Explain the Zotikov Movement?
Editor:
　　Yesterday, I read the full text of Guo Moruo's speech at the welcome meeting in Harbin in your newspaper on May 22nd, which said, "Especially the Soviet workers are rewarding the Stakhanov movement on the one hand, and the Zotikov movement on the other." This is the first time I have encountered the term "Zotikov movement". I have consulted many books, but have not been able to find an explanation. I hope your newspaper can provide an answer. Sincerely, Fan Zhongjian.
　　Answer: Alexander Zotikov (also translated as Zhutkike) is a technician assistant at the Red Holm Textile Factory, one of the largest textile enterprises in Moscow. He is a Stakhanov movement worker. In the upsurge of socialist competition, he suggested organizing a competition for high-quality products. In late January of this year, he and the textile workers in his workshop undertook the obligation to specialize in the production of high-quality textiles, and proposed launching a movement to "strive for the title of first-class product production team." In his work team, the number of defective products manufactured has been reduced to a few thousandths, making 99 percent of the Red Holm Textile Factory's daily products first-class. In the Soviet Union, everything bearing the imprint of the Soviet state is perfect and the best in the world. The goods of the Red Holm Textile Factory have won this honorary trademark. Zotikov's initiative was responded to by all the workers of the textile factories in just a few days. News of his success quickly spread throughout the Soviet Union, and hundreds of other enterprises responded enthusiastically. Factories in light and local industries in Leningrad, Ivanovo, Saratov, Tashkent, Kazan and many other cities launched a movement to "strive for the first-class product production team," and have produced thousands of excellent work teams. Because this movement was initiated by Zotikov, it is called the Zotikov movement. The Zotikov movement is a new development of the Stakhanov movement. It is an improvement in product quality after the improvement in quantity, making the production of Soviet workers a step further. This is the result of the technological upsurge of the culture of the Soviet working class, which fully demonstrates the combination of physical and mental labor. At the same time, the launch of this movement is a high expression of the heroism of the Soviet working people. This kind of working people's hero can only appear in the socialist society of the Soviet Union, which is absolutely impossible in capitalist countries.

### 佐的基夫运动怎样解释？

专栏：问答

　　佐的基夫运动怎样解释？编辑先生：
    昨阅五月二十二日贵报载郭沫若在哈市欢迎会上演讲词全文，中说“尤其是苏联的工人，一面在奖励斯达哈诺夫运动，一面又在奖励佐的基夫运动”云云。关于佐的基夫运动这一个名词，确是第一次遇到，查了许多的书籍，始终没有查出。希望贵报予以解答。范中坚拜启
    答：亚历山大·佐的基夫（又，译为朱特基克）是莫斯科最大纺织企业之一-红色贺尔姆纺织厂的一个技师助手。他是一个斯达哈诺夫运动者。在社会主义竞赛热潮中，他建议组织高等质量产品的竞赛。今年一月下旬，他和他工作间的纺织工人承担了专事生产高等质量的纺织品义务，并且提议发动“争取头等货品生产工作队的称号”的运动。在他的工作队里，制造物品上的废品，已减少到千分之几，使红色贺尔姆纺织厂每天产品的百分之九十九都是头等货。在苏联打有苏维埃国家截印的每一件东西，都是完美的，都是世界上最好的。而红色贺尔姆纺织厂的货品，就获得了这个荣誉的商标。佐的基夫的倡议，仅仅几天，便得到各纺织厂全体工人的响应。他的成功的新闻很快就传遍全苏联，于是几百个其他企业都热烈响应。列宁格勒、伊凡诺夫、萨拉多夫、塔什干、喀山及其他许多城市的轻工业及地方工业的工厂，掀起了“争取头等货品生产工作队”的运动，并已产生了数千个优等的工作队。因为这个运动是佐的基夫发起的。故称这个运动为佐的基夫运动。佐的基夫运动是斯达哈诺夫运动的新的发展，是把产品从量的提高进步到质的提高，使苏联工人的生产又前进了一步，这是苏联工人阶级文化的技术的高涨的成果，充分表现了体力劳动与智力劳动的结合。同时这个运动的发起正是苏联劳动人民英雄主义的高度表现。这种劳动人民英雄就只有在社会主义社会苏联才能出现，那些资本主义国家是绝不可能有的。
