Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th: New Delhi dispatch: The Indian Constituent Assembly passed a resolution on the 17th regarding the future relationship between India and the British Commonwealth, namely, India would declare so-called "independence" on the one hand, but remain in the British Commonwealth on the other. Nehru, representing the interests of India's new financial clique, strongly urged the assembly to pass the resolution. When Nehru spoke in the assembly hall, patriotic Indian people held demonstrations outside the assembly hall, opposing the Indian reactionary group's betrayal of the genuine independence and liberation cause for which the Indian people had sacrificed and struggled for many years, and demanded the severance of relations with the British Commonwealth.

　　印人民游行示威
  　要求与英联邦断绝关系
    【新华社北平二十日电】新德里讯：印度制宪议会十七日通过英联邦总理会议关于英印未来关系的决议，即印度一方面宣布所谓“独立”，另一方面则仍留在英联邦内。代表印度新财阀集团利益的尼赫鲁，曾力促议会通过该决议。当尼赫鲁在议会厅内发言时，印度爱国民众曾在议会厅外举行示威游行，反对印度反动集团背叛印度人民多年流血牺牲、奋斗争取的真正独立解放事业，并要求与英联邦断绝关系。
