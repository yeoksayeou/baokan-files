Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 15th: The "New Era" magazine published an editorial entitled "The Fourth Anniversary of Victory over Germany," stating:

　　After the war, the American, British and French ruling cliques abandoned the principle of international cooperation and reverted to the old and bankrupt policy of isolating the Soviet Union, organizing aggressive military blocs against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The consequences of this policy are particularly harmful to the solution of the German question. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has faithfully and consistently adhered to the decisions jointly adopted by the Allies at Yalta and Potsdam. The policy of the Western countries is completely the opposite, which has made the preparations for the German peace treaty stagnant, declared the bankruptcy of the four-power control mechanism in Germany established in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and the United States, Britain, and France have gone far down the dangerous road of dismembering Germany and restoring its industrial war potential. Immediately after the separate meeting held in London in February 1948, which passed a series of measures to dismember Germany, the Anglo-American joint occupation zone was declared established. This policy is manifested economically in the separate currency reform, and politically in the separate West German state, formulating the so-called "Bonn Constitution," which led to the so-called Berlin problem.

　　Comparing the Soviet Union's unyielding struggle to defend peace with the actions of the Western countries, millions of people can easily see which side truth and justice belong to. The Soviet Union has proposed peaceful settlement of the Berlin dispute at least three times in a year, but each time it was obstructed by the policymakers of the United States and Britain. Only at the beginning of this month, after the Soviet and American representatives held talks in New York "British and French representatives participated in the later stage of the talks," did the four countries reach an agreement to lift all restrictions on traffic and trade between Berlin and the western occupied zone of Germany, and between the eastern occupied zone and the western occupied zone, on May 12, 1949. Eleven days after the lifting of these restrictions, that is, on May 23, 1949, a four-power foreign ministers' conference will be held in Paris to discuss issues related to Germany and all the problems arising from the Berlin situation, including the Berlin currency issue.

　　The release of the communique was universally praised by the people of the world. Newspapers reported the satisfaction among the masses with the decisions of the four governments. Commentaries pointed out that things quickly achieved concrete results after the Western countries abandoned their previous tactics. The democratic newspapers pointed out that this step by the three Western countries was undoubtedly influenced by the broad movement protesting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its contained aggressive policies, and the powerful movement of the people of all countries defending peace and security and opposing the imperialists' war plans.

　　The four governments' decision on the German question may truly become a turning point in the post-war settlement process. The Foreign Ministers' Conference, decided by the Potsdam Agreement to be established, will continue its work after a long interruption, which opens up the possibility of reaching a unanimous decision on the German question.

　　The editorial concluded by pointing out that the four governments' communique on the German question has fostered clear hope in the hearts of people all over the world. The firm and consistent struggle of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe for lasting peace is an important factor in the post-war international situation. The policy of defending peace has gained the full support of the vast majority of people in all countries.

### 新时代杂志社论　评德国问题

  　评德国问题
    【新华社北平十五日电】莫斯科讯：“新时代”杂志以“对德胜利四周年”为题，发表评德国问题的社论称：
    战后美国及英法统治集团放弃国际合作的原则，回复到旧日的破产了的孤立苏联的方针，组织针对苏联与人民民主国家的侵略性的军事集团，这一政策的后果对解决德国问题特别有害。谁都知道，盟国在雅尔塔与波茨坦所共同通过的决定，苏联均忠诚而一贯的恪守着。西方国家的政策则完全相反，这就使对德国和约的准备工作毫无进展，使遵照波茨坦协定而设立的四国管制德国机构宣告了破产，美英法三国业已远远地走向肢解德国和恢复其工业战争潜力的危险道路。紧接在一九四八年二月在伦敦单独召开会议通过了一连串肢解德国的措施之后，英美联合占领区即宣告建立。这一政策表现在经济方面，是单独的货币改革，表现在政治方面，则是单独的西德国家，制订所谓“波恩宪法”，因而产生了所谓柏林问题。
    如将苏联不屈不挠地保卫和平的斗争与西方国家的行动相比较，千百万人民便不难看出真理与正义是属于哪一方的。苏联在一年当中至少曾三次倡议和平处理柏林纠纷，但每一次都遭到美英的政策制订者的阻扰。只在本月初，在苏联与美国代表于纽约进行商谈“英法代表曾参加后一阶段的商谈”之后，四国才获致了协议，在一九四九年五月十二日解除柏林与德国西部占领区间、东部占领区与西部占领区之间的交通运输及贸易上一切限制，在解除这些限制以后十一天，即一九四九年五月二十三日，将在巴黎召开四国外长会议，讨论有关德国的问题及由于柏林形势而产生的诸般问题，包括柏林货币问题在内。
    公报的发表受到了全世界人民的普遍赞同。报纸均报道群众中间对于四国政府决议的满意情绪。评论指出：西方国家放弃了他们先前的策略以后，事情就很快地获得了具体的结果。各民主报纸指出西方三国的这一步骤，无疑的是受到了抗议北大西洋公约及其所包含之侵略政策的广大运动，和各国人民群众保卫和平与安全，反对帝国主义者战争计划这一强有力的运动之影响所致。
    四国政府关于德国问题的决定，可能真正地成为战后解决过程中的转捩点。波茨坦协定所决定成立的外长会议，经长期中断之后，将继续工作，这一事实打开了在德国问题上作出一致决定的可能性。
    社论最后指出：四国政府关于德国问题的公报在全世界人民心中滋生了明确的希望，苏联及东南欧人民民主国家为持久和平而进行的坚决与一贯的斗争，是战后国际情势中的重要因素。保卫和平的政策获得一切国家绝大多数人民的充分支持。
