    [This Dispatch] The Cooperative Bank Head Office has now provided a loan to the North China Water Conservancy Cooperative in the form of 5,800,080 catties of millet, calculated based on its actual value, for the purpose of manufacturing and promoting waterwheels. This loan was approved by the North China Financial and Economic Committee earlier this month, and the contract was signed on the 25th of this month. It stipulates a monthly interest rate of three-thousandths in kind, and repayment in three installments: 20 percent in 1950, 30 percent in 1951, and 50 percent in 1952 (each time in November of the respective year). According to the person in charge of the North China Water Conservancy Cooperative stationed in Beiping, 30 million yuan has already been withdrawn from this loan, and nine iron factories, including Ci Xing and Chun Ji, have been commissioned to manufacture 964 waterwheels of various types. The cooperative is currently completing the project in accordance with its overall plan (approximately 6,000 waterwheels), and this batch of waterwheels will be promoted in Fangshan, Liangxiang, Zhuoxian, Xushui, Dingxing, and the vicinity of Beiping.
