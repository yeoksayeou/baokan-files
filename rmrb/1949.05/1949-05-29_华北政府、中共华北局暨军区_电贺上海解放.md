The liberation of this fourth largest city in the world, the largest metropolis in the country, within two weeks means that the largest nest of counter-revolutionaries has been wiped out, and Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan are united as one. The mighty army continues to advance south, wiping out the remaining enemies. The day when the banner of Mao Zedong flies all over the country is just around the corner. We hereby send our congratulations.
