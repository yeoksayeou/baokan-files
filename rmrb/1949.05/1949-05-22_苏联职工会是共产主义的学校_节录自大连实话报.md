Soviet Trade Unions Are Schools of Communism
Excerpt from Dalian Honest Talk Newspaper (Continued from yesterday)

　　The most important task of trade unions is to educate people on the discipline of labor and a communist attitude toward labor. The fundamental principle of socialism – from each according to his ability, to each according to his work – enables the combination of each member of society's private interests and public interests. The more labor productivity is improved, the more social welfare is increased, and the more the material happiness of each worker and the material happiness of the entire people are improved.

　　Under the conditions of a socialist society, the principles of non-exploitation of labor, friendly cooperation, and social mutual assistance are practiced. Only under these conditions can the socialist competition movement (a clear manifestation of vigorous Soviet patriotism) arise and develop universally. Socialist competition, according to Stalin's definition, is a communist method of socialist construction based on the maximum initiative of millions of working masses.

　　Now socialist competition is striving towards completing the Five-Year Plan in four years. The scope and content of the competition can determine the level of the socialist attitude towards labor. In the process of socialist competition, everyone's creative attitude towards labor is cultivated, treating labor as a sacred responsibility to Soviet society and the state.

　　All participants in the competition, while striving to create models of high labor productivity, are breaking technical and design conventions and developing resources that can exceed production plans. The task of every Soviet trade union organization lies in helping those participating in the competition with all their strength, repelling all disruptions and sabotage that hinder the creative labor of the masses, and repelling elements that obstruct serious self-criticism by the masses.

　　Educating everyone with the attitude of a true master, treating socialist property (which constitutes the economic foundation of the Soviet state), is naturally realized in the implementation of the specific undertakings of Soviet trade unions. Defending and consolidating socialist property – this is the primary responsibility stipulated by the Soviet Constitution and placed before every Soviet citizen.

　　Workers come into contact with state property every day and every hour, using materials belonging to the entire society to produce public wealth. They work daily beside lathes and machines, which are also part of the public wealth. The degree of socialist consciousness of the workers can also be seen from how they care for the people's property with the attitude of a master.

　　Carefully taking care of equipment and saving materials and raw materials means protecting the state's means of production and strengthening the foundation of the Soviet social system. Starting from saving a kopeck or a ruble, the workers accumulate millions for the country and strengthen the national power of the Soviet state.

　　The undertakings of Soviet trade unions are multi-faceted and very complex. As communist schools, trade union organizations carry out enormous political education work. Lenin once said that trade unions are educational institutions. They are gaining great victories in overcoming the remnants of capitalism in human consciousness and educating members with communist understanding. They use all possible methods within the organization to resolutely fight against all non-socialist attitudes towards labor and social property, and they also resolutely fight against individual Soviet people's flattery and worship of decadent bourgeois culture.

　　Soviet trade unions instill in their members a conscious communist attitude towards labor, educate them with Soviet national pride, love for the Soviet motherland, resolute hatred for the enemies of the motherland, and develop and consolidate the noble moral qualities inherent in the socialist society of their members.

　　Soviet trade unions have established cultural palaces, clubs, red entertainment rooms, libraries, newspapers, radio stations, and so on. They are densely distributed throughout the country. All their activities are devoted to explaining the Party's policies to the working people, closely uniting the masses, and striving for new victories in communist construction.

　　The arena for Soviet trade union activities is very broad. They constantly strive to comply with Soviet labor law (the most progressive labor law in the world). The Soviet government entrusted many tasks to the trade unions – supervising the implementation of labor protection, managing all state insurance and social insurance for workers and staff. The trade unions exercise supervision over trade enterprises and public food, and vigorously develop public gardening and individual gardening, etc.

　　The Soviet working class and its trade unions stand at the forefront of the world working class. Their entire glorious history demonstrates a high degree of consciousness, organization, and a model of unity and struggle for communist construction.

　　The Soviet working class and its trade unions stand at the forefront of the struggle, opposing war provocateurs, striving for the unity of the world workers' movement, and striving for lasting peace and true democracy.

　　苏联职工会是共产主义的学校
  　节录自大连实话报（续昨）
    职工会最重要的任务，就是在创造劳动的纪律上，对待劳动的共产主义态度上，进行教育。社会主义一项根本原则——各尽所能，按劳取酬——可使社会中每一成员底私人利益和公共利益相结合。劳动生产力越是提高，社会福利也就越发增加，每一劳动者底物质幸福，整个人民的物质幸福也就越发提高。
    在社会主义社会的条件之下，实行着劳动人员不受剥削，彼此友好合作，社会互助的原则。只有在这等条件之下，才能产生并普遍发展社会主义竞赛运动（这是生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义的显明表现）。社会主义竞赛，根据斯大林的定义，就是以千百万劳动群众最高限度积极性为基础的社会主义建设的共产主义方法。
    现在社会主义竞赛正向四年完成五年计划努力竞赛底范围和内容可以判定对待劳动的社会主义态度达到了什么样的水平。在社会主义竞赛的过程中，栽培着大家对待劳动的创造态度，把劳动看成如同对于苏维埃社会，对于国家的神圣责任一样。
    一切竞赛的参加者，在努力创造高度劳动生产力的模范时，正在打破技术上设计上的陈规，开发能以超过生产计划的资源。苏维埃职工曾每一组织底任务就在于——以全力帮助参加竞赛的人，打退有碍群众创造劳动的一切扰乱破坏，打退阻挠群众认真自我批评的分子。
    教育大家以真正主人的态度，对待社会主义财产（这种财产构成苏维埃国家底经济基础），这种教育任务在苏维埃职工会的具体事业的实行中，自然实现。保卫并巩固社会主义财产——这是由苏联宪法所明文规定，摆在每一苏维埃公民面前的头等责任。
    工人每一天每一小时都同国家财产有来往，以属于整个社会的物资来生产公共的财富，他们天天在车床、机器旁边工作，这些车床、机器，也是公共财富的一部分。从工人们是怎样在用主人态度关心人民资财，也可以看出他们高度的社会主义觉悟。
    细心照料装备，节约物资和原料——这意味着保护国家底生产工具，加强苏维埃社会制度底基础。从一个戈比一个卢布的节约作起，工人们为国家积累成百万巨数，加强苏维埃国家底国力。
    苏维埃职工会底事业是多方面的，很繁复的。作为共产主义学校的职工组织进行着巨大的政治教育工作。列宁曾经说职工会就是教育机关。战胜人类意识上的资本主义残余，教育会员以共产主义的认识，职工组织正获得很大的胜利。他们利用组织内一切可能利用的方法，向一切对待劳动和社会财产的非社会主义态度作坚决的斗争，个别苏维埃人民对腐朽的资产阶级文化的阿谀崇拜，也受到他们坚决的斗争。
    苏维埃职工会对会员灌输对待劳动的自觉的共产主义态度，教育以苏维埃的民族自豪，热爱苏维埃祖国，坚决痛恨祖国底敌人，发展并巩固会员们所固有的社会主义社会底高贵道德品质。
    苏维埃职工会创设文化宫、俱乐部、红色娱乐室、图书馆、报纸、无线电分站等等。它们密布全国各地。其一切活动都致力于在劳动人民中解释党底政策，紧密团结群众，争取共产主义建设底新胜利。
    苏维埃职工会活动园地非常宽阔。他们常努力求得遵守苏维埃劳动法（世界上最进步的劳动法）。苏维埃政府委托给职工会很多的工作——监督劳动保护的进行，管理一切工人、职员底国家保险、社会保险。职工会行使对贸易企业的监督，对公共食粮的监督，大力发展公共园艺生产及个人园艺生产等等。
    苏联工人阶级及其职工会站在世界工人阶级底先锋地位。以他们全部光荣的历史表现出高度觉悟性、组织性以及为共产主义建设而团结奋斗的模范。
    苏联工人阶级及其职工会站在斗争队伍的最前列，反对战争挑拨者，争取世界工人运动底统一，争取永久的和平和真正的民主。
