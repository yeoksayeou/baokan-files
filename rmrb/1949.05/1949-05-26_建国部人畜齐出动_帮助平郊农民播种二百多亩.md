　　【Ping City News】A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Construction Department began to actively help the masses in the Ping suburbs cultivate land and rush to sow crops in mid-May, following instructions from higher authorities. In addition to manpower, there were also thirty-six livestock to help with cultivation. The Second Battalion was responsible for Yangmen Village, and because the village where they were helping was far away, the livestock brought their own feed. The First Battalion was responsible for Xindian Village, and in order to rush the sowing, they ate earlier every day. Within three days, the entire regiment helped thirty-seven poor and hired peasant households without labor to cultivate land and rush to sow two hundred and nineteen and one-third mu, earning praise from the masses. Some prepared food for the soldiers, but it was declined. The peasants compared the People's Liberation Army with the Kuomintang bandit troops, saying: "You are different from the people who lived in Beiyuan in the past: at that time, we didn't dare to approach them (referring to the Kuomintang army). When we were busy with farming, they even seized livestock and people; how could they talk about helping with production!"

　　建国部人畜齐出动
    帮助平郊农民播种二百多亩
    【平市讯】人民解放军建国部某部于本月中旬开始接受上级指示，积极帮助平郊群众耕地抢种。除人力外，还有三十六匹牲口助耕。二营负责仰门村，因助耕村庄较远，牲口自带草料。一营负责辛店村，为了多抢种，每天提早吃饭。三天内，全团帮助无劳力的贫雇农三十七户耕地抢种二百一十九亩三分，得到群众赞扬。有的准备好饭让战士吃，但被谢绝。农民将解放军与国民党匪军对比，说：“你们与过去北苑住的人不一样：那时我们就不敢接近他们（指国民党军）。正在农忙时，他们还抓派牲口和人，哪里谈到帮助生产！”
