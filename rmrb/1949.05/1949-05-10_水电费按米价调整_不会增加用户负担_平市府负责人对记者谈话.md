    Adjusting Water and Electricity Fees Based on Rice Prices Will Not Increase the Burden on Users
    Interview with a Responsible Person from the Ping Municipality Government
    [Our Newspaper] The prices for water and electricity fees, as adjusted by the Jibei Electric Power Company and the Water Company of this city, have been announced and will be implemented starting in May. Our reporter specifically interviewed a responsible person from the Municipal Government, who made the following remarks:
    1. Reasons for Adjusting Fees:
    Currently, during the period of the People's Revolutionary War, the general trend of prices is upward. However, in the liberated areas, price increases occur under the circumstances of the victorious development of the revolutionary war. Here, the prices of raw materials and market goods, as well as the salary income of the working people, are consistent. Therefore, price increases fundamentally do not affect the lives of the working people. This is fundamentally different from the situation in the Kuomintang areas, where the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and the frantic plunder by bureaucratic capital have made it impossible for the broad masses of people to live, resulting in insane price increases. Beiping City is currently experiencing a spring famine, and due to a lack of rain, grain prices in various places are higher than in our city, creating a phenomenon of reverse flow between urban and rural areas. Therefore, the recent rise in prices in our city is a very natural phenomenon. After prices rise, the fees for public utilities in our city should naturally also be appropriately increased.
    In Beiping City, the electricity and water fees in 1936 were as follows: meter light fee was 22 cents per kilowatt-hour, equivalent to 6.88 *jin* of millet at that time; power fee was 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, equivalent to 2.81 *jin* of millet. Water fee was 22 cents per metric ton, equivalent to 6.88 *jin* of millet. After 1947, due to severe price fluctuations, although adjustments were made monthly according to the index, the income was only sufficient to cover wages and coal costs (for the water company, wages and electricity costs). As for equipment, it has not been added or replenished since 1947. For more than three years, the machinery and equipment have been consumed day by day, and the damage to the underground water pipes in the city of the water company has become even more serious. Last year, the average leakage rate accounted for 40% of the total water supply. After liberation, the company requested permission from the Military Control Commission to increase fees. At that time, the Military Control Commission, in order to take care of the lives of the citizens of Beiping, did not allow the company to raise prices, and stipulated that the electricity fee standard should be calculated based on the average price of millet for the entire year of 1948, which was 1 *jin* of millet per kilowatt-hour for power, 1.2 *jin* of millet per kilowatt-hour for the first level of meter light fee, and 1.5 *jin* of millet per kilowatt-hour for the second level, and converted based on the market price of millet at that time (1 *jin* equivalent to 10 People's Currency yuan). The water fee standard was calculated at 2 *jin* of millet per metric ton, equivalent to 20 People's Currency yuan. According to this standard, the electricity power fee is only slightly more than one-third of that in 1936, the meter light fee is only slightly more than one-quarter of that in 1936, and the water fee is only slightly less than one-third of that in 1936. This still cannot supplement equipment. Starting in March, the millet price for electricity fees was changed to 15 yuan per *jin*. The price in April remained the same as in March, while the rice price for water fees had not changed from February to April. Now the market price of millet has generally sold for more than 30 yuan per *jin*, and the wage millet price for April has been set at 31 yuan per *jin*. The company's expenses and wage payments must be calculated and paid according to the wage millet price, but the fees are still calculated based on 10 yuan for water fees in February and 15 yuan for electricity fees in March. Therefore, the losses are very large. In order to prevent the company from losing too much and enable it to serve the people of Beiping City for a long time, from a long-term perspective, it is reasonable and necessary to adjust the rice price for fees now. The fee price for May will be adjusted according to the wage millet price for April (31 yuan per *jin* of millet).
    2. Will the Adjustment of Water and Electricity Fees Affect People's Lives?
    It should be recognized that this adjustment of water and electricity fees is not an increase in prices, but merely a reasonable adjustment in rice prices. The standard for electricity fees is calculated in real terms, and after the adjustment, it remains the same as before. The power fee is 1 *jin* of millet per kilowatt-hour, the first level of meter light fee is 1.2 *jin* of millet per kilowatt-hour, and the second level is 1.5 *jin* of millet per kilowatt-hour. The water fee was originally calculated at 2 *jin* of millet per metric ton, but after this adjustment, it will be reduced to 1.5 *jin*. Therefore, after the adjustment, it will not increase the actual burden on general industrial and commercial users, as well as workers and staff users, and will not affect their lives. Because all salaries are paid based on the conversion of rice prices, the adjustment of water and electricity fees is not higher than the rice price.
    In addition, the city's trading company has sufficient strength to stabilize prices. Any speculative merchants who try to take the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market will be hit.

### 水电费按米价调整  不会增加用户负担  平市府负责人对记者谈话

    水电费按米价调整  不会增加用户负担
    平市府负责人对记者谈话
    【本报讯】本市水电收费调整以后的价格，已经冀北电力公司及自来水公司公布，从五月份起实行，记者特为此走访市府负责人，承发表谈话如下：
    一、调整收费的原因：
    目前在人民革命战争期间，一般说来，物价的趋势是上涨的，但在解放区，物价的上涨是在革命战争胜利发展的形势下发生的，而这里的原料与市场物价及劳动人民的薪资收入是一致的，因而物价的上涨基本上不影响劳动人民的生活，这和国民党区由于国民党反动统治的崩溃与官僚资本疯狂掠夺，使广大人民无法生活的情况下的物价疯狂上涨，是有根本性质的不同。北平市近日正临春荒季节，又因缺雨，各地粮价高于本市，形成了城乡倒流的现象。故本市最近物价上升，是很自然的现象。物价上升之后，本市公用事业收费自然也应该适当提高。
    本市水电的收费情形，在民国二十五年时，表灯费每度二角二分，折合当时小米六·八八市斤，动力费每度九分，折合小米二·八一市斤。水费一公吨二角二分，折合小米六·八八市斤。三十六年以后，因物价波动厉害，虽每月按指数调整，但收入仅能维持支付工资和煤费（自来水公司是工资和电费）。至于器材一项，从三十六年以来，就久已没有添置补充，三年多来，使机器设备一天天消耗下去，自来水公司城内地下水管损坏的情形更为严重。去年一年平均漏水率占全部供水量的百分之四十。解放后，公司方面曾向军官会请求准予增加收费，当时军管会为照顾北平市民的生活，没有允许公司加价，并规定电费标准照三十七年全年平均价格折米计算，计动力费每度小米一市斤，表灯费第一级每度一·二市斤，第二级每度一·五市斤，并按当时小米市价（一斤合人民券十元）计算折取。水费标准每公吨按小米二市斤计算，折合人民券二十元。照这标准，电力动力费仅达二十五年的三分之一强，表灯费仅及二十五年的四分之一强，水费仅及二十五年的三分之一弱，这样还是无法补充器材。从三月份起，电费小米折价改按每市斤十五元计算，四月份仍旧照三月份价格，水费则从二月份以来至四月份米价迄未变更。现在小米市价一般已经卖到三十多元一市斤，工资米四月份已规定为每斤三十一元，公司的开支和发放工资，都不能不照工资米价计算支付，但收费却还是水费按二月份的十元，电费按三月份的十五元计算，因此亏累很巨。为了维持公司不致赔累太多，并使能长久为北平市人民服务，从长远的利益着眼，现在把收费米价调整，五月份收费价格按四月份工资米价格（每斤小米折合人民券三十一元）调整，是合理的，而且也是必要的。
    二、水电收费价格调整之后，会不会影响人民生活？
    应该认清，这次水电费并不是加价，而只是在米价上予以合理调整，电费的收费标准以折实计算，调整后，还是照过去一样不变。动力每度小米一市斤，表灯费第一级每度一·二市斤，第二级每度一·五市斤，水费每公吨原是按小米二市斤计算，这次调整后，则减为按一斤半计算，因之调整之后，并不增加一般工商用户以至工人职员用户的实际负担，不会影响他们的生活。因为一切薪资的发给是按米价折合的，水电费的调整并不高于米价。
    此外，本市贸易公司有充分力量稳定物价，任何投机商人如果想乘机抬高物价，扰乱市场，都必会遭到打击。
