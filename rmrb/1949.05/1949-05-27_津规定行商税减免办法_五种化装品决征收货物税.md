　　Tianjin Stipulates Measures for Tax Reduction and Exemption for Itinerant Merchants
  　Five Types of Cosmetics Decided to be Subject to Goods Tax
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to promote urban-rural trade and the exchange of goods between regions, the Tianjin Tax Bureau has formulated temporary supplementary measures regarding the collection of business tax and temporary profit income tax for itinerant merchants. The gist of the measures states: The business tax for itinerant merchants dealing in grains, cotton, vegetables, melons, fruits, and other goods is reduced to 1.5%. Peddlers from rural areas whose sales amount to less than 20,000 yuan are exempt from business tax and temporary profit income tax. Furthermore, fixed-location merchants from other districts who hold purchase and sales certificates from local county-level tax authorities or formal certificates from the county government's industry and commerce bureau, stating that their business income tax is collected locally, are also exempt. Public institutions from various regions with similar certificates are also included in the exemption.
    [Another Dispatch] Regarding five types of cosmetics, including snow cream, face cream, talcum powder, cologne, and soap, the Tax Bureau will levy goods tax and has announced that all manufacturers must register with the bureau before June 5. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be subject to punishment.
