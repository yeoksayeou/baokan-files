　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 29th: The educational cause in the Northeast Liberated Area has achieved significant results in the past three years. According to the latest statistics from the Northeast Administrative Committee's Education Department: The entire Northeast region (excluding Inner Mongolia) now has 28 specialized schools and above, with 35,099 students. The number of schools has increased by more than one and a half times compared to the 11 schools before the "September 18th" Incident, and nearly doubled compared to the 15 schools during the puppet Manchukuo era in 1940. The number of students has increased nearly sixfold compared to the 4,964 students before the "September 18th" Incident, and more than fivefold compared to the 5,222 students during the puppet Manchukuo era in 1941. The region currently has 274 middle schools, with 161,650 students. The number of schools has increased by 30 compared to the 244 schools before the "September 18th" Incident, and the number of students has increased nearly threefold compared to the 40,521 students before the "September 18th" Incident, and more than doubled compared to the 68,946 students during the puppet Manchukuo era. The region currently has 36,061 elementary schools, with 3,692,747 students. The number of schools has increased by more than one and a half times compared to the 13,225 schools before the "September 18th" Incident, and increased by more than 14,600 compared to the 21,377 schools during the puppet Manchukuo era in 1941. The number of students has increased more than threefold compared to the 758,828 students before the "September 18th" Incident, and increased by more than 1.45 million compared to the 2,241,322 students during the puppet Manchukuo era. Although adult education in the entire Northeast has developed relatively slowly, there are now 12 social education teams, nearly 100 cultural centers, 26 libraries, and 300 workers' night schools, with approximately 20,000 students. Last year, over 30,700 winter schools were opened, with over 1,230,000 students. The people's education cause in the Northeast has not only achieved tremendous development in quantity in the past three years, but also undergone fundamental changes in quality. Among young students, a worldview of serving the people and revolutionary thought of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism have been initially cultivated, and cultural levels have been generally improved, enabling an estimated 80,000 middle school and university students who have undergone ideological transformation to participate in military, economic, cultural, and educational revolutionary work or to enter universities. In the past three years, due to the improvement of people's living standards, the vast number of workers' and peasants' children have also gained opportunities for schooling. Middle schools have a certain number of publicly funded students, specifically for the children of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and poor workers and peasants to enroll. In the middle schools of the North Manchuria region, students from worker and peasant families account for approximately 50% of the total number of students. In elementary schools, children of workers and peasants account for more than 88% of the total number of students.
