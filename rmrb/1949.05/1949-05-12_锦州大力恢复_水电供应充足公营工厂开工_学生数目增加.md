Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th: Jinzhou City, which was severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, is continuing its recovery and reconstruction. The electric power company has newly repaired a 1,500-kilowatt generator and seven main power lines, providing sufficient power for some factories and civilian use. Long-distance telephone lines are being rushed to repair a direct line to Shanhaiguan. The waterworks has increased the daily water supply time from six hours to nine and a half hours (under Kuomintang rule, it was only two or three hours per day). Publicly operated pottery, brewing, and clothing factories in the city have all resumed operations. The number of privately-owned factories that have resumed operations has reached 1,551. There are already thirteen cooperatives of various kinds in the city. There are currently twenty-nine primary schools, and the total number of students has increased from more than 7,000 at the time of the initial liberation to 16,000. There are forty-three night schools for the people, with a total of more than 2,000 students. The Liaoxi Provincial Boys' Middle School, Girls' Middle School, Railway Middle School, and the cadre school of the CPC Liaoxi Provincial Committee, all located in the city, have begun classes.
