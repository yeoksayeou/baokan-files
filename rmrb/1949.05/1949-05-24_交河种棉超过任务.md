　　Jiaoche Exceeds Cotton Planting Task
    [News from Jizhong] The Jiaoche County Party Committee seized the cotton planting season and made every effort to dig wells and plant cotton, and has now exceeded its task. According to statistics from 315 villages in 13 districts (out of a total of 328 villages in the county), 23,222 mu have been planted, exceeding the original target by 722 mu. However, because of the dry winter with little snow, the windy spring, and the prevalence of black soil in Jiaoche, the early-planted cotton urgently needs watering. But some of the masses still have the idea of ​​being afraid of hard work and waiting for rain, and some still have doubts about our burden policy. Most of them are planting more but reporting less, fearing heavy burdens or confiscation, so they adopt a perfunctory attitude towards watering the cotton. On May 8th, the County Party Committee issued an emergency instruction, emphasizing that district cadres should personally go down to inspect, mobilize and organize the masses to water the cotton. After the district cadres held a village cadres' meeting to arrange discussions, organized publicity and organization in groups and areas, and the Party members and cadres took the lead and communicated with activists, the masses personally saw the benefits of watering. The masses in most villages are actively watering the cotton by carrying water, pulling water, and pushing water, and are stepping up the planting of peanuts and autumn crops.

　　交河种棉超过任务
    【冀中讯】交河县委抓住种棉节令全力突击挖井点种棉花，现已超过任务。根据十三个区三百一十五个村（全县共三二八个村）已种上二三二二二亩，超过原订任务七百二十二亩。但因去冬天干少雪与今春多风又加交河黑土地多，早种的棉花急需浇水，可是部分群众仍有怕累、等雨思想，有的对我负担政策仍有怀疑。多是种多报少，怕负担重或没收，对浇棉也就采取应付态度。县委于五月八号发出紧急指示，强调指出区干要亲自下去检查，发动组织群众进行浇棉。又经过区干召开村干会布置讨论，分组分片宣传和组织，党员干部带头与积极分子的串通，群众亲自见到浇后的好处，大部村的群众正挑水拉水推水，积极浇棉，并突击点种花生和大秋作物。
