　　Hoeing one inch close to the seedling is as good as applying fertilizer,
　　Abundant harvests will fill the granaries to the brim.
　　The hoe carries three points of rain,
　　Preventing drought is better than watering the garden.
　　Hoe the seedlings the first time, weeds the second,
　　The third time, mound the soil to firmly seal the roots.
　　Hoe the millet four times, it will yield grade two-eight rice,
　　Hoe the wheat three times, it will yield grade one-nine flour.
　　Hoe the cotton in the hot season eight times,
　　The floss will be fine and good for spinning, producing more thread.
　　Hoe millet dry, hoe cotton wet,
　　Not too dry, not too wet, hoe sesame,
　　Millet needs to be sparse, wheat needs to be dense,
　　A calf can lie down in the cornfield.
　　Thin out the dense, keep the sparse,
　　If neither sparse nor dense, keep the big ones.
　　Crops don't recognize fathers or mothers,
　　Take care of them well and you will harvest more grain.

　　锄地歌
    苗锄一寸顶上粪，
    粮食丰收满着囤。
    锄头带有三分雨，
    预防旱灾顶浇园，
    头遍苗来，二遍草，
    三遍拥土根封严。
    谷锄四遍，二八米，
    麦锄三遍，一九面。
    伏里棉花锄八遍，
    绒细好纺多出线。
    干锄黍，湿锄花，
    不干不湿锄芝麻，
    谷要稀，麦要稠，
    棒子地里卧小牛，
    稀留密，密留稀，
    不稀不密留大的。
    庄稼不认爹和娘，
    收拾到了多打粮。
