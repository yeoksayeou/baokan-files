  　Factory Director Takes the Lead in Saving
  　Workers Formulate Plans to Save Labor and Materials
    [Our Dispatch] The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory held a factory-wide employee meeting on the 21st to convey and discuss Comrade Bo Yibo's call for thrift. All employees studied this report in conjunction with the Soviet "Pravda" editorial on thrift, and conducted reviews in light of actual conditions, identifying some wasteful phenomena in past work. Subsequently, led by Factory Director Sun, they first formulated personal saving plans: collect scrap iron, save stationery, and strive to spend two hours each day talking individually with workers to understand the saving situation, and conduct commendations and criticisms. More than 20 workers in the forging workshop also automatically convened a meeting after the meeting, discussing and formulating six saving measures: 1. Ensure assistance to all workshops in completing all tasks. 2. Ensure that the fire is started and preparations are made 20 minutes before the whistle sounds, to avoid wasting time. 3. Coal should be burned thoroughly, and coal slag should be extracted and mixed with good coal for reuse. 4. Calculate materials accurately, without wasting even a fraction of a cent. 5. When manufacturing various machine parts, use waste materials as much as possible, and only use good materials when absolutely necessary. 6. The quality must be good and conform to standard dimensions, so as to save labor in turning and planing. According to statistics on the 24th, workers Bi Miancai, Wang Wentao, and Chen Dejun have already managed to save more than 100 jin of coal per day. The rolling mill department has reduced its daily coal consumption from 1,200 jin to 800 jin, and is using this as a condition to challenge other production departments. After hearing the news that the factory director was personally leading the savings effort and that the forging workshop was issuing a challenge, the workers in the foundry workshop also formulated a savings plan, aiming to fully utilize scrap iron to cast useful machines. The carpentry workshop plans: previously, making 60 water wheel buckets required 26 workers and 240 square feet of lumber; in the future, they will reduce it to 21 workers and 220 square feet of lumber. They also plan to take wood scraps and shavings to the foundry workshop for use as fuel, without wasting a single piece of wood. Welders Meng Guangsheng and Zhuang Changfa proposed: "When work comes, weld immediately; after welding, immediately pull the switch to cut off the current; remaining welding rods must be joined together for use. We will do what we say!" All employees in the management section also formulated plans to save stationery and paper, utilize waste paper, and collect waste materials, among other savings measures.

　　华北农业机械总厂
  　厂长带头节约
  　职工订出省工省料计划
    【本报讯】华北农业机械总厂于二十一日，召开全厂职工大会，传达讨论薄一波同志的节约号召。全体职工将此报告与苏联真理报关于节约的社论联系学习，并联系实际进行检讨，检查出过去工作中存在着一些浪费现象。接着由孙厂长领头，首先定出个人节约计划：收拾废铁，节省文具，并每日争取抽两小时与工人个别谈话，了解节约情况，进行表扬与批评，锻工场工人二十余人，也在会后自动召开会议，讨论出六项节约办法：一、保证帮助各工房完成一切工作。二、在响汽笛以前二十分钟一定升火做好准备工作，以免浪费时间。三、煤炭烧的要透，煤碴检出要再掺入好煤复用。四、计算材料要准确，不使分厘白耗。五、制造各种机器零件，尽量利用废料，不得已时再用好料。六、质量要好，合于标准尺寸，以便车刨省工。据二十四日统计，工人毕绵财、王文涛、陈德俊三人，已作到每天节省煤一百多斤。轧钢部，每天由烧一千二百斤煤减为八百斤。而且以此条件向各生产部门挑战。铸工场工人听到厂长亲自领导节约及锻工场挑战的消息后，也订出了节约计划，要充分利用废铁铸成有用的机器。木工房计划：以前作六十个水车斗子得用二十六个工，二百四十方英尺木料，以后要减到二十一个工，二百二十方英尺木料。并要把碎木片与刨花拿到铸工场作燃料用，不浪费一分木料。焊工孟广生、庄长发提出：“来了活马上焊，焊完了马上拉闸切断电流，剩余的焊条要接上用，说到做到！”经理课全部职员也定出节约文具纸张，利用废纸，收集废料等节约计划。（柏青）
    【本报讯】华北农业机械总厂现已聘请清华大学机械系老教授刘仙洲先生为该厂顾问。刘先生曾任东北大学教授、北洋工学院院长等职，对农业机械及农田灌溉颇有研究。（柏青）
