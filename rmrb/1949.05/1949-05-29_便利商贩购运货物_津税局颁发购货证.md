　　Tianjin Tax Bureau Issues Purchase Certificates
　　[This Newspaper's Report] In order to facilitate merchants in Tianjin, both itinerant and seated, to go out and purchase and transport goods, the Tianjin Tax Bureau has stipulated the issuance of purchase certificates. The procedure is as follows: merchants, both itinerant and seated, fill out an application form and submit it to the relevant tax collection office for stamping. Itinerant merchants must also find a shop guarantor, fill in the proposed location for purchasing goods and the estimated round-trip schedule, and apply for a purchase certificate. After purchasing the goods at the purchase location, they should fill in the name, quantity, unit, and total price of the goods in detail on the purchase certificate and report to the local tax authorities for inspection and stamping. When returning to Tianjin, they should report to the tax collection office of the Municipal Tax Bureau for inspection, so as to levy taxes in accordance with regulations. These application forms and purchase certificates are issued by the tax collection offices under the bureau. It is reported that local tax authorities will allow tax-free passage for those who hold these purchase certificates to purchase and transport goods to various places.
