Overview of Social Education in the North China Region
Regarding the social education situation in the North China region, it will be discussed in two parts.

I. Urban Social Education

People's Cultural Centers (formerly known as People's Education Centers) are one of the effective forms of social education organizations in cities. Through the various activities of the People's Cultural Centers, many things have been done for the masses, and the political level of the masses has been improved. Its facilities are determined according to the needs of the masses, reversing the old methods of the People's Education Centers in the enemy and puppet era.

Taking the Shijiazhuang People's Cultural Center as an example, in addition to reading books and newspapers and blackboards, an inquiry office has been added. According to the nature of the questions, answers are given in the Answer Record, Blackboard News, and Shijiazhuang Daily. It not only guides the thinking of the masses but also understands the demands of the masses in each period, providing reference for the leadership to implement policies. Last April, a wired broadcasting station with twenty-four loudspeakers was added, distributed on various streets. Whenever it broadcasts, groups of people listen quietly to the news broadcast under the loudspeakers. The working masses reflected: "In the enemy era, only the rich could sit in their houses and listen to the radio, but now we can also listen to the radio." Other exhibition work has been carried out more than twenty times a year. In addition to exhibitions in the museum and street exhibitions, exhibitions have been carried out in factories and troops, which have also achieved good results. In order to implement policies, various lectures and seminars are often held to enable the masses to understand the policies, and various tasks can be carried out smoothly. The Zhangjiakou People's Cultural Center, in addition to carrying out daily work, also runs a job placement office, which introduces jobs or studies according to the situation. The Hunyuan People's Cultural Center pays special attention to uniting and transforming old artists, so that old opera actors can also embark on the road of serving the masses. The Pengcheng People's Cultural Center in Cixian uses slides to show films with educational significance. The transformation of peep shows by the Zanhuang People's Cultural Center is also welcomed by the masses. The People's Cultural Centers in Handan, Bozhen, Xinji, and Dingxian have different focuses, but they are all supported by the masses everywhere! It is fundamentally different from the People's Education Centers in the enemy and puppet era, which were exclusively for the ruling class to enjoy entertainment or for idle people to spend their time.

According to incomplete statistics, there are now sixty-nine People's Cultural Centers in large, medium, and small cities in the North China region. Because the urban masses need it, there will be considerable development in the future.

The issue of worker education has always been valued by the democratic government. In addition to the worker schools or short-term training courses established by the government and the trade union, the social education authorities have paid special attention to the spare-time learning of workers. For example, the focus of social education in Beijing is to run worker study classes. The first batch will run sixty classes, and some have already started classes.

In addition to carrying out political and cultural education, the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Literary and Art Department convened representatives of more than seventy enterprises and factories in the city to discuss the direction of workers' recreational activities in order to develop workers' recreational activities. Now, the factories are carrying out various small-scale recreational activities according to the spirit of the forum.

The Beijing People's Broadcasting Station recently held a forum with workers to solicit opinions from workers on improving broadcasting work and decided to add worker broadcasting programs so that workers can use modern propaganda tools to conduct self-education.

Not only do workers get learning opportunities in the city, but also young people who are willing to study further get the same learning opportunities in spare-time tutoring. In January of this year, there were 270 students in the Shijiazhuang spare-time tutoring school. These young men and women from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, and merchants, are very active in their studies. Some of those with good grades have already studied algebra and the second volume of intermediate Chinese. The students have also organized a student union, and each class has published its own newspaper, "Youth Life" and "Spare Time Life." At the same time, a large yangko team of more than 40 people has been organized, becoming a model of regularization for spare-time tutoring schools. Twelve of the twenty-nine accounting personnel who graduated in December last year were introduced to jobs at that time. They were grateful to the school and asked the government to expand the number of classes before leaving the school. The government accepted the demands of the masses and decided to expand the spare-time tutoring school to twenty classes.

The library, which has always been the most rigid, has also improved its work under the leadership of the People's Government. The Beijing Municipal Library has successively set up sixteen mobile stations in factories, and Shijiazhuang has established eleven volunteer book lending offices to expand the readership and facilitate the learning of the masses, especially the working masses. All these new creations in social education work are created under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people.

II. Overview of Rural Social Education

In the North China Liberated Area, from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression to the People's Liberation War to eliminate the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, every step of mass education has been closely integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the people in North China. After land reform and the emancipation of the masses, it has been further developed, mainly manifested in the development of winter schools, people's schools, and the active mass entertainment.

(1) Winter Schools, People's Schools, and Youth Literacy Classes

Last year's winter school was carried out in conjunction with central tasks such as land reform and party rectification. Although the tasks of participating in the war and supporting the front were heavy, most areas still developed it universally. According to statistics from 25 counties (cities) such as Xingtai, Zuoquan, and Changzhi in the Taihang area, there are a total of 5,313 administrative villages, and 6,460 winter schools were opened. Some large administrative villages have two winter schools. Among them, in 170 villages in six counties such as Yuci and Huguan, the number of enrolled students was 48,509. After the end of each winter school, many are transformed into regular people's schools. The mass schools in Yuanchao County, Jinnan District, are well-run and have persisted for many years. According to a survey in the autumn of last year, there are 244 mass schools in the county, and the number of students in the adult department has reached 11,012.

The organizational form and learning methods of winter schools and people's schools are adapted to the production of the masses and combined with the central work. For example, in Anping County, Jizhong District, 111 villages used literacy classes, 12 villages used natural occasions such as dining halls, workshops, etc., 7 villages used production organizations, and 8 villages used troupes. For example, when the masses in Wuxun County, Jinnan, were busy with war service, they organized a mobile winter school with more than 3,000 people along with the stretcher team to carry out cultural education work. In terms of learning methods, the masses in various places have their own creations. For example, women in Wuxiang created a card-character armband, changing a new character on it every day, so they can learn while spinning and weaving. Tianzikou in Fuping, Chahar Province, created a literacy sun and moon card, with one card per household and one character per card. The whole family learns, and the next day they push it down in sequence, with thirty households as a group, rotating once a month. Similar creations are too numerous to mention.

Due to the high enthusiasm of the masses for learning, the learning results are very significant. The political gains can be clearly seen from the masses' spontaneous participation in the army and the war. In terms of culture, many illiterate farmers have learned to use abacuses, keep accounts, and write simple letters. Here is just one recent literacy test as an example:

Statistics of the winter school test in 19 villages in the 5th district of Laishui County, Chahar Province, last year:

Literacy Count          Men      Women     Total
1-10                   47       98        145
10-50                  770      215       985
50-100                 105      121       226
100-150                103      152       255
150-200                51       93        144
200-250 and above       21       25         46

What is particularly worth mentioning is the conscious and automatic organization of learning by young men and women, and the New Democratic Youth League plays a leading and guaranteeing role in the learning of young people and the entire masses. Sixty of the ninety-two people's schools in Pingshan County are led by the New Youth League. The organization of Taihang Youth Literacy Classes is even more widespread. According to the recent statistics of 25 counties such as Wuxiang and Shexian, there are a total of 507 youth literacy classes (or cultural learning groups), with 38,052 young men and 36,046 young women, totaling 74,098 people.

(2) Mass Entertainment Activities

The new rural drama troupe was born during the War of Resistance Against Japan and promoted the direction of "the masses emancipating themselves, singing and playing for themselves" after the land reform. This direction has been developing. This year's Spring Festival celebration of the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing made mass entertainment more active. According to statistics from parts of three counties, Huanghua, Shenxian, and Cangxian in Jizhong, there are 102 drama troupes and 77 yangko teams. 1,531 people participated in 122 drama troupes and yangko teams in Heshun County, Taihang. Among them, there are 668 women. In entertainment activities, the creativity of the masses has been brought into play. Jincheng County, Taiyue, received 129 scripts, ditties, etc. written by the masses, including 69 current affairs pieces, 36 production pieces, 10 land reform pieces, and 14 other pieces.

Old operas have also been reviewed and reformed. Jiluyu has preliminarily reviewed 151 Gao Diao operas, and other places have also adapted or newly compiled many historical dramas. For example, the Hunyuan City Theater performed 40 acts of Yue Fei's biography and multiple volumes of Water Margin. At the same time, many old opera troupes have added new operas.

Great achievements have been made in the transformation of folk artists and folk arts. In the past two years alone, Jiluyu has trained more than 710 folk artists (storytelling, painting, engraving, music, etc.). Thirty-five kinds of new lyrics, seven new scripts, more than twenty kinds of new New Year pictures, and more than twenty kinds of comic strips have been created. Achievements have been made in training and organizing drum ballad teams and blind propaganda teams. Yangcheng and other six counties in the Taiyue area have 199 drum ballad teams, and Wuxiang and other three counties in the Taihang area have 186 blind propaganda teams. They themselves created 128 new words.

(3) Blackboards, Newspaper Reading Groups, and Rooftop Broadcasting

Blackboards and rooftop broadcasting are good ways to carry out rural social education. Almost every village has one or even several blackboards. Rooftop broadcasting is also more common. According to recent statistics from three counties in Shenxian, Jizhong, 546 villages have rooftop broadcasting. The Blackboard News Editorial Committee of Lujiawan, Lingshou County, has developed more than 20 worker-peasant correspondents to improve the culture of the masses by writing articles for the blackboard news. Newspaper reading groups have been well-maintained in villages with a good foundation in social education. For example, Dabu Village in Shenze reads newspapers when there is a market, and reads newspapers regularly in a certain place, thus guiding more than 40 households to subscribe to newspapers privately. For another example, Han Keqin's newspaper reading group in Mengxian takes the method of newspapers following the masses. The masses can learn about current affairs when they are collectively producing and attending work.

The combined propaganda method of blackboards, newspaper reading groups, and rooftop broadcasting can achieve the effect of household knowledge and in-depth education.

    华北区社会教育概况
    关于华北区社会教育的情况，分作两部分来谈。
  一、城市社会教育
    人民文化馆（旧称民教馆），是城市中行之有效的社教组织形式之一。通过了人民文化馆的各种活动，给群众办了不少的事情，提高了群众的政治水平。它的设施根据群众需要来决定，一反过去敌伪时代民教馆老一套的作法。
    以石家庄的人民文化馆为例，书报阅览和黑板报以外，又添了问事处，按照问题性质，分别在答事录、黑板报和石家庄日报上给以答复。它不但指导了群众的思想，又从中了解到每个时期中群众的要求，供领导上施政的参考。去年四月增设有线广播台一座，二十四个喇叭，分布在各条大街上，每当播音时，成群的人在喇叭下静听播送的新闻。劳动群众这样反映：“敌人时代、有钱的人才能坐在房子里听广播，现在咱们也能听广播了”。其他展览工作，一年举行了二十多次，馆内展览、街头展览外，更深入工厂部队去进行展览，也收到了良好的效果。为了贯彻政策并经常举行各种讲座和座谈，使政策为群众所了解，各种工作能得以顺利进行。张家口的人民文化馆，除进行日常工作还举办职业介绍所，根据情况分别介绍工作或学习。浑源的人民文化馆，特别注意团结改造旧艺人，使旧剧的演员也能走上为群众服务的道路。磁县彭城的人民文化馆利用幻灯，映演有教育意义的片子。赞皇的人民文化馆改造西洋镜，都是为群众所欢迎的。其他如邯郸、泊镇、辛集、定县的人民文化馆，工作重点虽不尽相同，到处为群众所拥护却是一样的！它和敌伪时代专供统治阶级消遣娱乐，或为投闲置散的民众教育馆，根本不同。
    华北区大中小城市中的人民文化馆，据不完全的统计，现在已有六十九处。因为城市群众需要它，今后还会有相当的发展。
    关于工人教育问题，向来是民主政府所重视的。除政府与职工会所设立的职工学校或短期训练班外，社教机关特别又注意了在职工人的业余学习，如北平市社教重点首先是举办工人学习班，第一批先办六十个班，现在有的已开学上课了。
    天津市的各个工厂，除进行政治文化教育以外，为开展工人的文娱工作，军管会文艺处招集本市七十余企业工厂代表座谈工人文娱活动的方向。现在各厂正根据座谈的精神，进行各种小型的文娱活动。
    北平人民广播电台，最近又召开了工人座谈会，征求工人同志对改进广播工作的意见，决定增设工人广播节目，使工人利用现代化的宣传工具进行着自我教育的工作。
    城市里不只工人得到学习机会，此外一般愿意深造的青年，在业余补习学习中也同样得到学习机会。今年正月间石家庄的业余补习学校就有学员二百七十人，这些工农商各界的青年男女，学习的都很积极，程度好的有的已学代数和中级国文第二册。同学们并已组织起学生会，各班出版了自己的报纸“青年生活”“业余生活”，同时还组织了四十多人的大秧歌队，成为业余补习学校正规化的典范。去年十二月间毕业的二十九个会计人员，当时就有十二个人介绍了职业。他们感激学校，临离校之前，要求政府扩大班次，政府接受了群众的要求，决定把业余补习学校扩充为二十个班。
    一向最呆板的图书馆，在人民政府领导下，工作也有所改进，北平市立图书馆，先后在工厂中设立了十六个巡回站，石家庄成立起十一处义务图书代借处，扩大读者面，便利了群众特别是工人群众的学习。所有这些社教工作中的新创造，都是在毛主席为人民服务的思想指导下所创造出来的。
  二、农村社会教育概况
    华北解放区，自抗日民族解放战争，到消灭国民党反动统治的人民解放战争，群众教育的每一行程，都是和华北人民的革命斗争密切结合着的；而在土地改革，群众翻身以后，更得到了新的发展，主要表现在冬学，民校的开展，和群众文娱的活跃上。
    （一）冬学、民校和青年补习班
    去年冬学，是结合土改、整党等中心工作进行的。虽然参战支前等任务繁重，但大部地区仍然普遍的开展起来了。如太行区邢台、左权、长治等二十五县（市）的统计，共行政村五千三百一十三个，即开办冬学六千四百六十处，大的行政村有的有两座冬学。其中榆次、壶关等六个县，一百七十个村，入学人数为四万八千五百零九人。每年冬学结束后，有许多转为经常民校，办得较好的如冀南区元朝县的群众学校，连年坚持，去年秋季调查，全县有群校二百四十四所，成年部学生即达一万一千零十二人。
    冬学、民校的组织形式和学习方法，是适应群众生产和结合中心工作进行的，如冀中区安平县的冬学，利用识字班形式的有一百一十一村，利用吃饭时，饭铺、作坊等自然场合的有十二村，利用生产组织的有七村，利用剧团组织的有八村。又如冀南武训县在群众忙于战勤时，曾随着担架队组织起三千多人的流动大冬学，进行文化教育工作。在学习方法上，各地群众都有自己的创造。如：武乡妇女创造了卡字袖章，每天在上面换一个生字，纺线织布，都能学习。察省阜平田子口创造了识字日月牌，每户一牌，每牌一字，全家学会，第二天依次推下，三十户为一组，一月轮一遍。类似这样的创造，不胜枚举。
    由于群众学习情绪的高涨，学习的成绩是很显著的。在政治方面的收获，可以从群众自发的参军、参战等看得很清楚。在文化方面，许多不识字的农民，学会了打算盘、记帐和写简单的书信。这里只举最近一个识字测验为例：
    察哈尔省涞水县五区十九个村去年冬学测验统计：识字数　　　　　　　　　　　　人数　　　　　　　　　　　　　合计
　　　　　　　　　　　　　男　　　　　女１—１０　　　　　　　　　４７　　　　　９８　　　　　　　１４５１０—五０　　　　　　　７７０　　　　２１５　　　　　　　９８５五０—１００　　　　　　１０５　　　　１２１　　　　　　　２２６１００—１五０　　　　　１０３　　　　１５２　　　　　　　２５５１五０—二００　　　　　　５１　　　　　９３　　　　　　　１４４二００—二五０以上　　　　２１　　　　　２５　　　　　　　　４６
    特别值得提出的是青年男女的自觉、自动组织起来的学习，而新民主主义青年团更在青年以及整个群众学习中，起了带头和保证作用。平山县九十二座民校中，有六十座是新青团领导的。太行青年补习班的组织更为普遍，据最近武乡、涉县等二十五县的统计，青补班（或文化学习组）共五百零七组，男青年三万八千零五十二人，女青年三万六千零四十六人，共七万四千零九十八人。
    （二）群众文娱活动
    新的农村剧团，在抗战中产生，土改后发扬了“群众翻身、自唱自乐”的方向。这方向是一直在发展着。今年春节庆祝平津解放，群众文娱更为活跃。冀中黄骅、深县、沧县三个县部份的统计，有一百零二个剧团，七十七个秧歌队。太行和顺县一百二十二个剧团和秧歌队，参加人数达一千五百三十一人。其中有妇女六百六十八人。文娱活动中，发挥了群众的创造。太岳晋城县收到群众编写的剧本、小调等一百二十九件，内容包括时事六十九篇，生产三十六件，土改十件，其它十四件。
    对旧剧也进行了审查和改造。冀鲁豫将一百五十一出高调剧作过初步审查，其他各地还改编或新编了许多历史剧。如浑源市戏院排出岳飞传四十幕，水浒传多本。同时许多旧戏班都添演了新歌剧。
    民间艺人和民间艺术的改造，成绩很大。单就冀鲁豫两年来训练过的民间艺人（说唱、画、刻、音乐等）即达七百一十名以上。创作新唱词三十五种，新剧本七个，新年画二十多种，连环画二十多种。训练和组织鼓书队和盲人宣传队等，都有成绩。太岳区阳城等六县有鼓书队一百九十九人，太行区武乡等三县有盲人宣传队一百八十六人，他们自己创作新词一百二十八个。
    （三）黑板报、读报组和屋顶广播
    黑板报、屋顶广播，是农村社会教育很好的进行方式。黑板报几乎每村都有一块甚至好几块。屋顶广播也较普遍，最近冀中深县等三县统计，有屋顶广播者五百四十六村。灵寿县芦家洼黑板报编委会，发展工农通讯员二十多人，通过为黑板报写稿的方法，提高群众文化。读报组在社教基础较好的村庄坚持的很好。如深泽大堡村在有集时读报，在一定场所，定期读报，这样引导着私人定阅报纸的达四十多户。又如盂县韩克勤的读报组，是采取报纸跟着群众走的方法。群众集体生产和出勤，都能学习时事。
    黑板报、读报组和屋顶广播的联合宣传方法，更能达到家喻户晓、深入教育的效果。
