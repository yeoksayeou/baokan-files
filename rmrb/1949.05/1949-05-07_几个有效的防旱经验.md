Several Effective Drought Resistance Experiences
North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture

On the 27th of last month, the North China People's Government issued an emergency notice, calling for early mobilization to combat the drought and ensure timely sowing, so as not to incur irreparable losses. We must use all manpower and all means to organize the fight against drought to ensure the harvest we should have.

Now we introduce the effective methods of drought resistance that have been used in various places for many years as follows:

    I. Fully carry out ideological mobilization, and eliminate the lucky waiting thoughts and passive pessimistic emotions among cadres and the masses. Recall the losses from past droughts and the experiences and lessons learned in drought resistance, in order to inspire the broad masses of people with the courage and confidence to fight drought. At the same time, we must realize that there are only half a month left to plant cotton and peanuts. Missing this season will make it impossible to plant, increase farmers' income, and ensure the supply of industrial raw materials.

    II. Carrying water for spot sowing: Spot sowing crops such as cotton, peanuts, corn, sweet potatoes, and potatoes is worthwhile because of their wide row spacing, small number of plants sown, and high yields. Past experience has shown that "carrying one more load of water means three more sheng of grain in the mouth." We must make full use of canal water, well water, pit water, and digging soil wells and sand ditches, etc., and strengthen the organization and management of canals and wells. All manpower, livestock, and carts should be fully mobilized to carry water and transport water so that water is used to its full potential. In particular, digging soil wells requires less labor and is effective quickly. Generally, a well can be dug in two or three days (there are many places in the plains with these conditions). This is the most effective way to overcome drought. We must seize the time and make a vigorous breakthrough. At the same time, coordinate with seed soaking, soil stealing (that is, scraping open the surface dry soil, digging out the wet soil, and concentrating it in the holes to be sown; or after a light rain, concentrating the surface moistened soil in the holes), and sowing deeper (in some places, it is called "jie shang" sowing, that is, first using a tiller or harrow to make deep furrows and then sowing. If sowing after a two- or three-finger rain, the wet soil beside the furrows can be covered in the furrows). The potato seed blocks should be larger, use organic fertilizer as the base fertilizer, or put the sorghum stalks, etc., after soaking them thoroughly, under the seeds, etc., to ensure timely sowing. This will save more water, make drought resistance last longer, and have a greater effect.

    III. Watering seedlings, weeding seedlings, and preserving seedlings: "Seeing seedlings means thirty percent of the harvest," but seedlings must be preserved, and missing seedlings must be replanted. There are two ways to preserve seedlings: watering seedlings and weeding seedlings. The water-saving method for watering seedlings is: use a hoe to scrape open a layer of soil next to the seedlings, water, and then cover with dry soil; or use a stick to poke three or four holes next to the crops, and water the holes with a pot. Generally, twenty or so loads of water can water one mu. After the water has seeped in, cover with soil. "The hoe has water" and "weeding the fields in a drought" and weeding the fields can resist drought, which we are familiar with, so we must weed more. In some areas, wheat seedlings have already died from drought. If you weed them, they can be drought-resistant. Weeding wheat can prevent drought, prevent yellowing, and increase yield. This is undeniable, but some places still believe that weeding will injure the wheat seedlings, which is incorrect. As long as you weed shallower and break up the soil clumps more, it is harmless and beneficial.

    IV. Dry sowing and dry plowing: Dry sowing millet is very good. The farmers' experience is "rather let the seeds rot in the ground than leave them at home" and "give up the seeds, don't give up the seedlings," which is very correct. It is even better to select varieties with strong drought resistance. If the land was not autumn-plowed last year, and it is too dry in the spring to plow, then you must start by manually dry plowing. This way, you can sow even after a light rain.

    V. Prevention and control of insect pests: "In drought years, hundreds of insects are born." The occurrence of insect pests this spring is earlier and more serious than in any year, which is related to the spring drought. Therefore, on the one hand, we must fight drought, and on the other hand, we must prevent and control insect pests.

In the past ten years, we have accumulated a lot of experience in overcoming disasters. As long as we all mobilize, take active action, and bring into play our past experience, under the many favorable conditions this year, we will achieve even greater results!

    几个有效的防旱经验
    华北人民政府农业部
    上月二十七日，华北人民政府曾发出紧急通知，号召及早动员起来向旱灾作斗争，保证及时下种，以免招致不可弥补的损失。我们必须用一切人力，一切办法，组织抗旱斗争，保证应有收成。
    今将各地多年抗旱的有效办法介绍于下：
    一、充分进行思想动员，扫除干部及群众中的侥幸等待思想及消极悲观情绪。回忆过去旱灾损失及抗旱中的经验教训，以启发广大群众抗旱斗争的勇气和信心，同时我们要认识种植棉花、花生的时间还只有半个月，放过了这个季节即不能种植，不能使农民增加收益，和保证工业原料的供给。
    二、担水点种：点种棉花、花生、玉蜀黍、红薯、马铃薯等作物是合算的，因其株行距宽，点种株数少，收获量高。过去的经验是“多担一担水，三升粮食到嘴”。我们要充分利用渠水、井水、坑水及打土井、挖沙沟等，并加强渠道水井的组织管理，所有人力、牲口、大车、全动员起来担水、运水，使水尽其用。特别是打土井费工少见效快，一般两三天就可以打成一眼（平原地区有很多地方有这条件），这是克服旱害最有效的办法，我们必须抓紧大力突击。同时配合浸种、偷土（即刮开表层干土，刨出湿土，集中于要点种的穴中；或于小雨后，将表层已湿润的土集中于穴中），种得深点（有的地方叫接垧下种，即先用耧或耠子划深沟再下种。如在二三指雨后播种可将沟旁湿土覆于沟内）。马铃薯的种块要大些，用有机质肥料做底肥，或把秫秸等压过泡透后，搁在种籽底下等等方法，保证按时下种，这样就更省水，抗旱的时间更长，效果更大。
    三、浇苗、锄苗、保住幼苗：“见苗三分收”但必须保苗，缺苗的补苗。保苗的方法有二：即浇苗、锄苗。浇苗的省水办法是：在苗旁用锄刮开一层土，浇水后覆盖干土；或用棍子在庄稼旁边扎三四个孔，用壶顺孔浇水，一般二十来担水即可浇一亩。待水渗完再盖土。“锄头有水”、“旱锄田”，锄田可抗旱，是我们所熟知的，我们必须多锄。现在有的地区麦苗已旱死，如果锄一锄即可耐旱。锄麦可防旱、防黄疸、增加产量，这是无可置疑的，但是有的地方仍认为锄后麦苗受伤，是不对的。只要锄浅些，土块打碎些，即无害而有益。
    四、干种干翻：谷子干种是很好的，农民的经验“宁肯种子烂在地里，不要撂在家里”、“舍籽不舍苗”，这是很对的。能选种防旱性强的品种更好。去年未秋耕的地，春旱耕不动，即须下手用人力干翻，这样下小雨也可以播种。
    五、防除虫害：“旱年百虫生”，今春虫害的发生较任何一年都早且严重，这与春旱有关，因此我们一方面抗旱，另方面要防除虫害。
    十年以来我们在克服灾荒上，积累了许多经验，只要我们全体动员起来，积极行动，发挥过去的经验，在今年许多有利的条件下，我们将获得更大的成绩！
