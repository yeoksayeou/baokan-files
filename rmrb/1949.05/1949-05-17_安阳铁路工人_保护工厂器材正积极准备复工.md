(Taihang Electric) Before liberation, railway workers in Anyang actively fought against the Chiang bandits, protecting locomotives and equipment. Since October of last year, the workers have continuously contacted the People's Liberation Army, inquired about victory news, and prepared to cooperate in the attack on Anyang and protect equipment. After returning, they informed each other: "Our People's Liberation Army is coming soon, we must protect the railway equipment well." They began by burying machine parts that were needed and easily damaged. In April of last year, as the remnant bandits tried their best to sabotage, the employees carried out a major burial, with the engineering section spending three days and three nights burying machinery. However, many bulky items such as rails and sleepers could not be buried, so they took turns guarding them. Even so, the bandits continued to sabotage, and the workers used the notice issued by the puppet commissioner's office, "Strictly Prohibiting Damage to Railway Transportation Equipment," to carry out legitimate struggles against the bandits. Although the enemy constantly added charges and detained workers, they still fought stubbornly. In addition to the things buried at the bottom of the water tower, the workers in the engineering section also preserved six cave dwellings full of machinery and equipment. Now the workers are digging them out, preparing to resume work.

　　安阳铁路工人
  　保护工厂器材正积极准备复工
    【太行电】安阳铁路工人在未解放前，曾积极与蒋匪进行斗争，保护了机车与器材。去年十月以来，工人们即不断的来和解放军联系，打听胜利消息和准备配合打安阳，保护器材。回去后即相互传告：“咱解放军快来了，咱要好好保护铁路器材”。开始他们把需要而易被破坏的机器零件先埋藏起来。去年四月时，因残匪极力破坏，员工们便进行一次大埋藏，工务段因埋藏机器曾用了三天三夜时间。但有许多笨重东西如铁轨、道木等，不能埋藏起来，他们便轮流看守。就这样，匪徒们仍不断破坏，工人们便利用伪专署所颁发的“严禁破坏铁路交通工具”的布告，给匪徒们作了合法斗争。虽然敌人不断的给加罪名，扣压工人，但他们仍然顽强不屈地斗争着。工务段工人除了水塔底里埋藏的东西外，还整整的保存了六个窑洞的机器、器材。现在工人们正在刨掘出来，准备复工。
