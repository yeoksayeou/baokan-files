    Decision of the Political Department of the North China Military Region Regarding the Disciplinary Action Against Comrade Tang Yongjian
    [This newspaper reported] The Political Department of the North China Military Region recently issued a decision regarding the disciplinary action against Comrade Tang Yongjian. The original text is as follows:
    The facts of the errors committed by Comrade Tang Yongjian, Chief of the Operations Section of the Military Region Headquarters, are as follows: On March 12th, Comrade Liu Tingfan, a clerk from the Ordnance Section of the Logistics Department of the Military Region, went to the Logistics Office to report his work to Commissar Huo of the Ordnance Section. Because he was unfamiliar with the route, he entered Comrade Tang Yongjian's room and asked Tang where Commissar Huo was. After asking twice, Tang was extremely dissatisfied. When Liu offered him some advice, Tang immediately cursed him and beat Liu, causing his nose to bleed. After the beating, he ordered him to "get out."
    Comrade Tang Yongjian's arrogant and violent behavior towards a cadre violates Party discipline and military discipline, and is a manifestation of warlordism. His understanding of the anti-warlordism education that our Party has put forward since the founding of the army is extremely superficial. The North China Bureau's announcement of the decision to punish Comrade Li Bo has not aroused his serious attention either. After the incident, he did not report to the Party. When the Party went to examine his mistakes, his self-criticism was still not deep enough. The Party committee asked him to write a self-examination, but he used the excuse of being busy with work and has not written it to this day. Comrade Tang Yongjian has done some good work, and has made some progress under the training of the Party and the army. His shortcomings are: arrogance and conceit. During the Party rectification, a struggle was waged against this kind of thinking, and he also admitted his mistakes, but he has not completely corrected them in his actual actions. In mid-February of this year, after entering Beiping, he scolded a regimental commander in Jizhong. Now, he has again engaged in the act of beating a cadre. If this kind of warlordist thinking is not corrected, it will be detrimental to the Party and the leading organs. At the same time, it should be pointed out that in this incident, Comrade Liu Tingfan did not retaliate when he was insulted and beaten, and only reported to the organization after completing his work. This attitude is correct.
    In order to educate Comrade Tang Yongjian and to enforce Party discipline and military discipline, the Political Department of the North China Military Region has decided to give Comrade Tang Yongjian a warning as a disciplinary action, and to ask him to continue to deeply reflect on his mistakes and to resolutely correct them in future actions. This decision will be announced throughout the army.

### 华北军区政治部  关于处分唐永健同志的决定

    关于处分唐永健同志的决定
    【本报讯】华北军区政治部日前发布关于处分唐永健同志的决定，原文如下：
    军区司令部作战处长唐永健同志，所犯错误，事实经过如下：在三月十二日，军区后勤部军械处科员刘廷范同志来后勤办公室找军械处霍政委汇报工作，因路径不熟，进入了唐永健同志室内，向唐询问霍政委在何处，连问两次，唐极为不满，刘向他提出意见时，唐即大骂，并将刘打的鼻破血流，打后令“滚出去”。
    唐永健同志这种蛮横殴打干部行为，是违犯党纪和军纪的，是军阀主义的表现，他对我党建军以来所提出的反军阀主义的教育，了解极不深刻，华北局公布了关于处分李波同志的决定，亦未引起他严重注意。事发后，亦不向党报告，当党去检查他的错误时，他检讨仍不深刻。党委要他写反省，他借口工作繁忙，直至现在还未写出。唐永健同志在工作中，有些工作做的是好的，在党和军队的培养下，有一些进步，他的缺点是：骄傲自大，整党时曾与他这种思想作过斗争，他也承认过错误，但在实际行动中并未完全改正，今年二月中旬进入北平后，曾骂过冀中一个团长，现又发生殴打干部行为，此种军阀主义思想，若不加以纠正，对党和领导机关，是有损害的，同时应指出，在这次事件中，刘廷范同志在被辱打时并未还手，将工作办完之后，才报告了组织，这种态度是对的。
    为了教育唐永健同志和严肃党的纪律和军队的纪律，华北军区政治部特决定给唐永健同志以警告的处分，并要他继续深刻的反省，在今后实际行动中切实改正。此决定在全军公布。
