    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th] Various reports: The proposal put forward by Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, requesting all member states to have "freedom of action" in handling their diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain, was discussed at the UN General Assembly plenary session on the 16th after being passed by the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee on May 7th. After a day of fierce debate, the proposal was finally rejected. In the voting, 15 countries opposed the proposal, 16 countries abstained, and only 26 countries supported it, falling short of the two-thirds majority. Leading the opposition to the proposal were the delegations of Poland and Czechoslovakia, who launched fierce attacks on Spanish fascism in the General Assembly.
    Regarding the status of Indian residents in South Africa, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution: India, Pakistan, and South Africa should hold a round table conference for discussion. Regarding the Indonesian issue, the General Assembly decided to postpone the discussion until September. Regarding the so-called "freedom of information" convention, the General Assembly, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries' representatives, passed the so-called "Convention on International Transmission of News and the Right of Correction." According to the resolution, the aforementioned convention will not be submitted to the UN member states for signature until another so-called "freedom of reporting" convention is passed.
