    Nanjing and Taiyuan Workers
    Celebrate "May Day" with Enthusiasm
    Vowing to Quickly Resume Work and Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Workers throughout Nanjing enthusiastically celebrated the first "May Day" Labor Day after liberation. On this day, workers from all sectors held gatherings, and workers vowed to commemorate this festival with practical actions to quickly resume work and step up production. When workers from the Qianghua and Jinling Clothing Factories held a meeting, they asked the representatives of the Military Control Commission present to give them production tasks. When they received the task of producing hundreds of thousands of sets of military uniforms, they immediately began to discuss how to expand equipment and improve production efficiency. Employees of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's southern section, who had been coerced by the Kuomintang bandit gangs to Nanjing, in order to rush to repair the section of railway from Chuxian to Pukou, the first batch of more than 30 electrical workers crossed the Yangtze River on "May Day," connected the lines, and the repair teams were preparing to set off. Students from various universities in Nanjing also formed more than 70 groups on this day to hold get-togethers with workers at Xiaguan wharves and Zhonghua Gate. When the workers' teams and students' propaganda trucks met on the street, the two sides warmly shook hands and sang together, "Our troops, the 'People's Liberation Army,' are here..."
    [Report from our newspaper in Taiyuan] On May 1st, the symposium of representatives of workers from all walks of life convened by the Military Control Commission and the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions was grandly opened in the Youth Cinema. After more than 300 representatives arrived at the venue, Yonghe, Director of the Taiyuan Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions and chairman of the conference, said: The purpose of convening this symposium of workers is to solicit workers' valuable opinions on the resumption of work and production in Taiyuan, and to understand the city's industrial production and workers' living conditions, in order to quickly resume work and production. Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission and Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, then spoke, saying: Taiyuan has been liberated. The first and foremost thing is to quickly resume work and production, support the Liberation War, and accelerate the victory of the whole country. When referring to the workers' living problems, Comrade Lai Ruoyu affirmed: "The Communist Party represents the working class and must seek happiness for the workers. If some problems cannot be solved immediately due to various difficulties, please understand this. We can only gradually improve the lives of workers through production, so we must put the restoration and development of production in the most important position." After the speech, the chairman announced an adjournment, and the representatives immediately took ten large trucks sent by the Military Control Commission to participate in the "May Day" demonstration parade.

    南京太原工人
    狂欢庆祝“五一”
    纷纷提出迅速复工生产
    【新华社南京三日电】南京全市工人热烈欢庆解放后的第一个“五一”劳动节。是日全市各业职工分别举行集会，工人们纷纷提出要以迅速复工加紧生产的实际行动来纪念这一节日。强华、金陵被服厂的工人集会时，向到会的军管会代表要求给予他们生产任务，当他们接到了数十万套军装的任务时，便立刻转入讨论如何扩充设备和提高生产效率等问题。被国民党匪帮胁迫到南京的津浦铁路南段各站员工，为抢修滁县至浦口段铁路，“五一”当天首批电务工人三十多人即渡过长江，接通了线路，抢修大队则纷纷准备出发。南京市各大学学生亦于是日组成了七十多个小组，分头到下关各码头和中华门等地和工人们举行联欢会。当工人队伍和学生的宣传卡车街头相遇时，双方热烈握手，齐唱着“我们的队伍‘解放军’来了……”。
    【本报太原电】五月一日，军管会暨华北总工会太原办事处召集的各业职工代表座谈会，假青年电影院举行了盛大隆重的开幕式。三百余名代表到达会场后，大会主席华北总工会太原办事处主任永和同志说：此次召开职工座谈会，是为了征询职工们关于太原复工生产中的宝贵意见，和了解本市工业生产及职工生活情况，以便迅速复工生产。军管会副主任兼中共太原市委书记赖若愚同志接着讲话，他说：太原解放了，首先的主要的事情就是迅速复工生产，支援解放战争，加速全国胜利。在提到工人的生活问题时，赖若愚同志肯定地说：“共产党是代表工人阶级的，一定要为工人谋幸福。如果由于各种困难有些问题不能马上解决时，要请工友们加以谅解。我们只有在生产中才能把工人生活求得逐步改善，因此要把恢复和发展生产放在最重要的地位。”讲话毕，主席即宣布休会，代表们当即分乘军管会派来之十辆大卡车参加“五一”示威游行。
