　　【Our Newspaper's Report】The Northern Factories Conference convened by the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways concluded victoriously yesterday (the 28th) after five days of reports and discussions. Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao also attended and delivered a speech. After the conference began, Zhou Xiaping, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Railways' Locomotive Bureau, first gave a summary report. After pointing out the achievements and shortcomings of the Tangshan and Changxindian factories, he proposed the following three points for future factory work:

　　(1) Establish a factory responsibility system: 1. Locomotive, passenger, and freight car overhaul and inspection responsibility system; 2. Mechanical equipment guarantee, use, inspection, and repair responsibility system (referred to as the "four guarantees" responsibility system for machinery); 3. Finished product production responsibility system; 4. Material management, use, purchase, and inspection responsibility system (referred to as the "four guarantees" responsibility system); 5. Leadership responsibility system; 6. Tool management and use responsibility system; 7. Inspection work responsibility system. The establishment of the above responsibility system adopts the principles and spirit of the responsibility system implemented in the Northeast, with fixed organization, joint labor, individual responsibility, and hierarchical responsibility, and should be established from bottom to top and from top to bottom in our railway factory production departments. The establishment of this system is to achieve improved locomotive overhaul quality, maximized mechanical efficiency, production of finished products and material usage and management that meet standards, and to implement economy, prevent waste, and establish a scientific and democratic work inspection system. However, absolute prevention of superficial establishment is necessary, and a widespread and in-depth ideological mobilization and meticulous and strict organizational work must be carried out in advance, and inspection and summarization must be carried out afterward.

　　(2) Improve production efficiency, determine production tasks, and formulate production plans. Requirements: 1. Complete the task of reviving 60% of damaged locomotives and passenger and freight cars; 2. Mass-produce spare parts, repair and assemble machines, and manufacture production tools; 3. To complete the above tasks, each factory should, on the basis of existing equipment and manpower, improve efficiency by 40% according to past car repair performance. The production tasks for the second half of the year will be completed in three stages. When assigning tasks, a method of starting with less and then increasing should be adopted, with monthly increases. Factories should solve the supply of spare parts and materials that can be resolved by their own capabilities and equipment by working hard to build a home, using old products, and giving play to the spirit of creation; major materials that cannot be solved by themselves will be solved by the Ministry of Railways.

　　(3) Establish a factory management committee, abolish the foreman system, and unify personnel organization and titles: Rely on all employees to implement factory management democratization, so as to give play to the sense of responsibility and initiative of the employees as masters. Consciously and voluntarily improve production with organization and discipline, improve efficiency, and cultivate the ability of workers to manage production. As for the foreman system itself, it is an unreasonable system of bureaucratic capital oppression of workers in the past and should be abolished, replaced by a new democratic management system, establish a inspection work system based on the factory responsibility system, with democratic management as the principle, employees participating in person, democratic evaluation, mutual supervision, encouragement, assistance, and inspection. Foreman personnel can be treated differently according to their ideology, character, and skills, and appropriately arranged. The review and decision of the trade union and the factory management committee should be obtained when the foreman changes jobs and allocates work.

　　The summary also proposed the unification of the organizational structure of railway factories, improvement of the leadership system, improvement of efficiency, development of the conservation movement, improvement of factory equipment, establishment of material pre-budget and cost planning systems, and unification of reporting systems and reporting content. Following this, Vice Minister Lü of the Ministry of Railways delivered a speech (original text to be issued separately), and the meeting concluded victoriously.

　　Vice Minister Lü's Speech

　　This factory affairs meeting is a revolution in Northern factory affairs work. After liberation, factories belong to the people, which is a great revolution. But this does not mean that all problems have been solved. There is still a practical problem that has not been solved. For example, workers' enthusiasm is gradually increasing, but production efficiency has not improved, and has even decreased. This is mainly because the old factory management system and production system have not been reformed and have not undergone a revolution. The characteristics of the old factory system are the blindness of production and the autocracy of management. The harm of continuing to exist in this system: First, it suppresses workers' initiative and creativity; second, it wastes manpower and resources.

　　A major reform of the old system is necessary. Without reform, workers' production enthusiasm cannot be brought into play, and the waste of manpower and material resources will inevitably increase. The solution is to organize all employees to implement a responsibility system. The factories we received are all dilapidated, and even these dilapidated factories were exchanged for the people's bloody struggle, which are very precious. The responsibility system is to hand over the factory to the factory director and all employees to manage and build the factory, so that it is full of vitality and efficiency. Therefore, all factory employees must first have a good understanding of the factory, clarify the situation, understand all the machines and materials, sort out the organization, sort out the factory buildings, establish a system, and be responsible for themselves. Strengthen technical equipment and implement enterprise management. The common goal of everyone is to improve efficiency and develop production. As long as everyone takes responsibility and everyone makes plans, not only will this task be completed, but the plan will be continuously improved and the standards will be raised.

　　The issue of thrift is to say that the fruits of labor production are not wasted at all. This is a long-term movement. I hope everyone will go back and organize discussions well, from comprehensive responsibility to improving labor efficiency, saving materials, and saving power, so that railway construction will be guaranteed.

　　Today, there are worker representatives, engineers, and factory directors present. In the past, during the era of imperialism and Kuomintang rule, physical labor and mental labor were separated and opposed, consciously creating contradictions, suppressing some, and using some, because this was beneficial to them. Today, the situation has changed, and this contradiction of opposition must be eliminated. Today, we must implement democratic management. Don't think that it will be difficult to manage if it is democratic. The more democratic, the easier it is to manage. If something cannot be done, everyone will discuss it, everyone will come up with ideas, and everyone will be responsible, and the factory director will be easier to be. Saying "it's difficult to manage if it's democratic" means that democracy is not being used well, and old ideas and styles are still at work.

　　It is necessary to establish criticism and self-criticism. If you are wrong, admit you are wrong. Correcting mistakes is progress. Engineers must integrate with workers. Good engineers should have several functions: (1) Organize labor and organize production; (2) Provide workers with concrete solutions to practical difficulties; (3) Raise workers' creative experience to a theoretical level. Engineers can only truly improve by going to the factory to understand workers, combining theory with practice, and combining with workers' practical experience. Workers must learn from experts and engineers to improve their theoretical level. Intellectuals must integrate with workers, mental labor must integrate with physical labor, and theory must integrate with practice. If employees unite and work together, the factory can be managed well, which will be conducive to the construction of the new democratic cause.

　　北方厂务会议闭幕
  　周侠平副局长指示今后工作：
    建立工厂负责制、确定生产任务及计划、建立工厂管理委员会。
    【本报讯】军委铁道部所召开的北方厂务会议，经过五天的报告讨论，已于昨（二十八）日胜利闭幕。铁道部吕正操副部长亦亲临致词。会议开始后，先由铁道部机务局周侠平副局长作总结报告。他在指出了唐山、长辛店二厂的成绩与缺点后，对今后厂务工作，提出应注意如下三点：
    （一）建立工厂负责制：一、机客货车包修、包检负责制；二、机械包管包用包检包修负责制（简称机械四包负责制）；三、生产成品负责制；四、材料包管包用包购包检负责制（简称四包负责制）；五、包领导负责制；六、工具包管包用负责制；七、检工负责制。以上负责制的建立是采取东北实行的负责制的原则和精神，固定编组、联合劳动、每人负责、按级负责的办法，在我们铁路工厂生产部门中应自下而上，自上而下的建立起来。这一制度的建立，是要达到机车检修质量的提高，机械效能的发挥，生产成品及材料使用管理的合乎标准，并实行节约，防止浪费，建立科学民主的工作检查制度。但应绝对防止形式上的建立，而必须事先进行普遍深入的思想动员与细密的严格的组织工作，事后进行检查、总结。
    （二）提高生产效率，确定生产任务，制订生产计划。要求：一、完成破损机车及客货车百分之六十的死车复活任务；二、大量预制配件，修装机器，制造生产工具；三、为完成以上任务，各厂应在现有设备及人力基础上，按照以往修车成绩，提高百分之四十的效率。下半年的生产任务分三个阶段努力完成。在给予任务时应采取先少后多的办法，逐月增加。各厂本身能力及设备能解决之备品材料，在刻苦兴家、利用旧品、发挥创造的精神下自行解决；主要材料自已无力解决者，由铁道部设法解决。
    （三）建立工厂管理委员会，取消监工制，统一人事组织机构及职称：依靠全体职工，实行工厂管理民主化，以发挥职工群众作为主人翁的责任心与积极性。自觉自愿的有组织有纪律的改进生产，提高效率，培养工人管理生产的能力。至于监工制度的本身是过去官僚资本压迫工人的不合理制度，应予取消，代之以新的民主管理制度，确定工厂负责制，建立检工制，以民主管理为原则，职工亲身参加，民主评定，互相督促、鼓励、帮助、检查。对监工人员，可视其思想品质及技能分别对待，适当安插。监工改职分配工作时，应经过职工会及工厂管理委员会的审查和决定。
    在总结中并提出了铁路工厂组织机构的统一，健全领导制度，提高效率，开展节约运动，改进工厂设备，建立材料预决算及成本计划制度，统一表报制度及表报内容。继由铁道部吕副部长致词（原文另发）后，会议即胜利闭幕。
　　吕副部长的讲话
    这次厂务会议是北方厂务工作的革命。解放后工厂属于人民，是一个大革命。但这并不等于一切问题都解决了，还有一个实际问题没有解决。例如：工人情绪逐渐高涨，但生产效率并没有提高，甚至降低了。这主要是旧的工厂管理制度、生产制度还没有改革，还没有经过革命。旧的工厂制度的特点，是生产的盲目性，和管理的专制性。这种制度继续存在，其害处：第一、压制工人积极性、创造性；第二、浪费人力与资材。
    要把旧的制度进行一个大的改革。不改革，工人的生产积极性就不能发挥，就必然要增加人力、物力的浪费。解决的办法：就是把全体职工组织起来，实行负责制。我们接收这些厂子都是破破烂烂的，而且就是这些破破烂烂的厂子也是经过人民流血斗争换来的，非常宝贵。负责制，就是把厂子交厂长和全体职工来管理和建设这个厂子，使之生气勃勃、发挥效率。因此，工厂全体职工首先要把厂子里作个很好的了解，情况弄清楚，机器材料都要了解清楚，整理组织，整理厂房，建立制度，自己负责。加强技术装备，实行企业化的管理。大家的共同目标，就是提高效率，发展生产。只要大家来负责，大家订计划，这样不仅能完成此次任务，而且会不断改进计划和提高标准。
    节约问题，是说把劳动生产的果实丝毫不浪费，这是个长期的运动，希望大家回去好好组织讨论，从全面负责，贯彻到提高劳动效率，节省材料，节省动力，这样铁路建设就有了保证。
    今天到会的有工人代表，有工程师，有厂长，过去帝国主义和国民党统治时代，把体力劳动和脑力劳动分开和对立起来，有意识的制造矛盾，压制一部分，利用一部分，因为这样才对他们有利，今天情况变了，必须把这种对立的矛盾消灭。我们今天要实行民主管理，不要认为民主了就不好管了。越民主越好管，办不了的事大家来讨论，大家出主意，大家负责任，厂长分厂长也就好当了。说“民主了就不好管了”，这是不会运用民主，旧的思想和作风，还在作祟。
    要建立批评与自我批评，错了就承认错了，改正了错误就是进步。工程师要和工人结合起来，好的工程师应有几种作用：（一）组织劳动，组织生产；（二）给工人具体解决实际困难；（三）把工人的创造经验提高到理论水平。工程师只有到现厂里去了解工人、把理论和实际结合，和工人的实际经验结合，才能真正提高。工人要向专家、工程师学习，提高理论水平。知识分子要和工人结合，脑力劳动要和体力劳动结合，理论与实际结合。职工团结，共同努力，才能办好工厂，才会有利新民主主义的建设事业。
