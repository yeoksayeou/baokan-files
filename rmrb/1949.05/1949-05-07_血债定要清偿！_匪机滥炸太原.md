Blood Debt Must Be Paid!
Bandit Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Taiyuan

[Taiyuan Telegraph] Two American-aided "Liberator" heavy bombers indiscriminately bombed the industrial area and workers' residential area of Taiyuan City at noon on the 5th. The bombing lasted for forty minutes, with twenty-four bombs dropped. Our anti-aircraft forces fiercely fired, causing the enemy planes to dare not fly low. According to investigations, seven workers and their family members were killed, and twelve workers were injured. A portion of buildings and warehouses were destroyed. Two bombs were also dropped on Gucheng Village, and a resident's entire family was crushed to death by the house. Wounded worker Duan Chengfu said with extreme anger: "Yan Xishan's reactionary rule almost starved us to death. The People's Liberation Army just rescued us, and Yan Xishan wants to bomb us to death with planes. We will never forgive Yan Xishan, the blood debt must be paid!"
