Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 22nd: TASS Vienna dispatch: Over 100,000 people in Vienna held an unprecedentedly powerful demonstration on the 17th, protesting the Austrian ruling clique's recent measures, under the guise of "improving" the country's financial situation, to plunder the people. These measures include, on the one hand, establishing a new income tax system with tax rates decreasing as income increases, and increasing the commodity turnover tax by one-half, which is enough to stimulate price increases for everything. On the other hand, they are issuing new government bonds while allowing wealthy people to convert worthless former Hitler government bonds at half the face value, and passing the "Law Encouraging Basic Investment," which exempts capitalists from all taxes on 20 percent of their net profits, and so on. Demonstrators held high flags with slogans such as: "Stop Plundering the People," "Let the Rich Take Out Their Money," and "Down with the New Agreement on Prices and Wages."

Everyone welcomed the speech of Communist Party member Onner with long and continuous applause. Onner pointed out: The government is placing the heaviest burden on the working people while giving new privileges to the capitalists. "Behind the new plunder plan, one can detect the hand of American capitalists pulling the strings of the Austrian government party puppets." Onner finally expressed confidence that the Austrian working people would find ways and means to end the government's anti-people activities. Fiala, the vice chairman of the Austrian Trade Union Federation, spoke next, exposing the treacherous activities of the right-wing trade union leaders, who secretly prepared a new plunder of the working people together with the capitalists. Fiala stated, "Today's meeting—the largest Vienna has ever seen—is being held under the unified goal of the working class's war and struggle."

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution condemning the so-called "New Agreement on Prices and Wages" and the resulting increases in prices, transportation costs, and taxes. The resolution stated: "The powerful demonstration of the working people of Vienna is a warning to the government and the government party in parliament. The struggle against the reactionary offensive does not end with this demonstration; it is only the beginning."

　　奥京十万人示威
  　抗议政府掠夺人民
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：维也纳十万以上人民在十七日举行空前强大的示威，抗议奥国统治集团最近在“改善”国家财政状况的烟幕下采取掠夺人民的措施。这些措施一方面包括建立税额随收入增加而递减的新所得税制，提高足以刺激一切物价上涨的商品流转税二分之一，另一方面又发行新公债而准许有钱人以已成废纸的前希特勒公债票面值半价折换，通过“鼓励基本投资法”而停免资本家纯利的百分之二十的一切税收等等。示威者高举旗帜，上面写着：“停止掠夺人民”，“让有钱的人拿出钱来”，打倒物价与工资的新协定。
    大家以久久不息的鼓掌欢迎共产党议员昂纳演说。昂纳指出：政府把最沉重的负担加诸劳动人民，同时却给资本家以新的特权。“在新的掠夺计划后面，人们能够觉察出美国资本家的手在牵动奥国政府党的傀儡”。昂纳最后表示确信奥地利劳动人民会找到终结政府反人民活动的途径与办法。奥国总工会副主席菲阿拉接着发言，他揭露了右翼职工会领袖的叛卖活动，这些领袖们秘密地与资本家一起准备了新的对劳动人民的掠夺。菲阿拉称，“今天的会——维也纳所曾看到过的最大的会，是在工人阶级的战争战斗的统一的目标下举行的。”
    会议一致通过决议。斥责所谓“物价与工资新协定”和因此而带来的物价、运输费和捐税的增加。决议称：“维也纳劳动人民的强有力的示威，是对政府和议会中的政府党的警告。抗击反动派进攻的斗争并不以这个示威为终结，它只是开始”。
