Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement
Adopted at the First National Congress of Chinese Women on April 1, 1949

(1) Chinese women have made significant contributions in every period of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. From now on, they must work even harder to unite with the people of the whole country to carry the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to the end, completely eliminate the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, and establish a brand-new People's Republic of China. Only in this way can women across the country be liberated.

(2) The People's Liberation War is developing victoriously, and the liberation of the whole country is not far off. Therefore, the task of building a new China is becoming increasingly heavy. Women in the liberated areas should continue to actively support the People's Liberation War, give full play to their talents and wisdom, and strive to participate in the construction of new democratic politics, economy, culture, and other undertakings; the central link is to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production in the liberated areas. Only by actively participating in production can women improve and consolidate their status, further improve their own lives and the lives of the people, more effectively support the People's Liberation War, and get rid of feudal shackles.

(3) In the past six months, many large and medium-sized cities have been liberated, and more cities will be liberated successively. Important industries are mostly concentrated in and around cities, marking the beginning of a new era centered on cities and led by cities over the countryside. Therefore, the importance of urban women's work has greatly increased compared to the past. Current women's work should focus on the urban women's movement, without neglecting rural women's work. The urban women's movement should be based on female workers, unite other working women, and strive to win over intellectual women, self-employed women, and women from other strata to work hard to eliminate the enemy and build a new people's city. Here, the first important thing is to organize working women to participate in industrial and handicraft production and commodity circulation as much as possible, based on the principles of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges. Therefore, working women in newly liberated cities should actively respond to the call for resumption of work and business, so that public and private enterprises can be quickly restored. Education should be strengthened for employed female workers to raise their awareness, establish new labor attitudes, promote production enthusiasm, and strengthen production efficiency. Various productive, consumer, and credit cooperatives should be organized in a planned and step-by-step manner, in combination with specific conditions and the development of the entire national economy. To meet the needs of industrial production, family members of workers and women who are able to work should be absorbed into production, and as many housewives as possible should be organized to participate in labor, so that many women who did not engage in production in the past can be transformed into creators of social wealth, and establish the concept of labor as glory. It is recommended that government economic agencies and enterprise departments give full assistance to these working women, appropriately solve their difficulties in the production of raw materials and the supply and marketing of their products, to facilitate the development of production and the improvement of people's lives.

(4) In cities with a preliminary work foundation, we should gradually remove feudal ideas, traditional customs, and urgent special difficulties that bind women, improve women's lives, promote women's and children's welfare undertakings, and run nurseries, maternal and child hygiene, and midwifery training, centering on the surrounding production undertakings. Mobilize and organize all laboring and democratic women to actively participate in the democratic movement, exercise democratic rights, abolish feudal oppression, and participate in all aspects of state power, to raise and protect women's political and social status.

(5) Intellectual women in urban and rural areas should strive to combine with working women and with production undertakings, improve their scientific knowledge and technical capabilities, and establish a viewpoint of serving the people. Female students should study hard and become useful talents for building a new democratic country. More opportunities for education should be given to working-class and peasant women to cultivate new-style intellectuals from working-class backgrounds. Professional women should study hard, master their business, and fulfill their duties well, so as to open up and consolidate the road for women to participate in various social occupations through their work performance. Knowledgeable and working women should be absorbed to participate in various training classes, study groups, and research institutes to cultivate a large number of excellent female teachers, female staff members, female economic workers, midwives, doctors, childcare workers, etc., to serve the construction of a new society. The old idea of ​​intellectual women's contempt for labor must be overcome. The necessity of combining with workers and peasants must be emphasized. Female cadres should be organized to go deep into factories and rural areas to serve the vast number of working women and children, to achieve communication and promote the development of urban and rural culture.

(6) In the rural areas of the liberated areas, we agree with the "Decision on Women's Work in Rural Areas of Liberated Areas" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in December 1948. This decision emphasizes that women in the old liberated areas should take active participation in production as the central link of all work. In the process of organizing women to participate in production, they must be good at combining it with the struggle against the feudal remnants that bind women, improve women's political and cultural level, mobilize them to actively participate in democratic governance, and promote maternal and child health, so that rural women can obtain further liberation. In the early stages of the new liberated areas, in the struggle against local bullies and bandits and the subsequent struggle to reduce rent and interest and distribute land, it is necessary to mobilize and organize women to participate and combine it with labor production. The principles of this decision should become the guiding principles for women's organizations in the liberated areas to work in rural areas and strive to implement them.

(7) Women who are still oppressed by the remnant reactionary forces of the Kuomintang are living an extremely painful life and urgently demand liberation. The task of women workers here should be to point out the root cause of women's suffering, make them recognize the path to liberation, and be good at using various methods to unite themselves, and together with the people, to improve their lives, to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the remnant reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, and to cooperate with the advance of the People's Liberation Army to carry out appropriate struggles.

(8) Based on the development of the Chinese revolution and the needs of the development of the women's movement, the congress decided to establish the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, which is a united front organization of democratic women from all strata and sectors of China and is the highest leading body elected by the First National Congress of Chinese Women. It must be based on urban and rural working women, closely contact and unite the democratic women of all strata of the country, faithfully implement the resolutions of this congress, and strive for the victory of the new democratic revolution in the whole of China. The congress believes that local women's organizations in urban and rural areas of the liberated areas should take women's representative conferences as the main form. This kind of women's representative conference is the main basic organization of the National Democratic Women's Federation.

(9) In the past three years, the connection between the Chinese democratic women's movement and the international democratic women's movement has made progress, which is of great significance for opposing the remnants of world fascism and supporting the international peace and democratic movement. In the future, it is necessary to further strengthen the connection with the international democratic women's movement, especially the democratic women's movements in Asian countries, to smash the imperialist conspiracy to create a new war and strive for lasting peace in the world.

    （二）人民解放战争胜利发展，全国解放为期不远。因之建设新中国的任务，日益加重。解放区的妇女应继续积极支援人民解放战争，发挥高度的才能与智慧，努力参加新民主主义的政治、经济、文化等各种建设事业；其中心环节，是恢复与发展解放区内的工业和农业生产。妇女只有积极参加生产，才能提高并巩固妇女的地位，进一步改善自己的生活和人民的生活，更有效地支援人民解放战争，解除封建束缚。
    （三）半年来已有很多大城市和中等城市被解放了，还将有更多的城市相继解放，重要工业多集中在城市及其附近，开始了以城市为中心，并由城市领导乡村的新时期。因此，城市妇女工作的重要性比过去大为增加。当前的妇女工作，要在不忽视乡村妇女工作的条件下，以城市妇女运动为工作的重心。城市妇女运动应以女工为基础，团结其他劳动妇女，争取知识妇女、自由职业妇女及其他各阶层妇女，为肃清敌人，建设人民的新城市而努力。在这里，首先重要的是在发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的原则下，尽量组织劳动妇女参加工业、手工业生产和商品流通工作。因此，新解放城市中的劳动妇女，应该积极响应复工复业的号召，使公私企业迅速恢复。对在业女工应加强其教育，使之提高觉悟，建立新的劳动态度，发扬生产积极性，加强生产效能，应当根据具体条件，和整个国民经济发展相结合，有计划有步骤地组织各种生产的、消费的、信用的合作社。应当适应工业生产的需要，吸收工人家属和能劳动的妇女参加生产，尽可能组织大批家庭妇女参加劳动，使许多过去不事生产的妇女，转为社会财富的创造者，并树立以劳动为光荣的观念。建议政府的经济机关和企业部门，给这种劳动妇女以充分的帮助，适当的解决他们的生产原料和生产品的供销困难，以利生产的发展和人民生活的改善。
    （四）在有了初步工作基础的城市中，应围绕在生产事业的周围，逐渐解除束缚妇女的封建思想传统习俗和迫切的特殊的困难，改善妇女生活，提倡妇女儿童福利事业，举办托儿所、妇婴卫生及助产训练等。发动和组织一切劳动的民主的妇女大众，积极参加民主运动，运用民主权利，废除封建压迫，参加国家政权各方面的工作，以提高并保障妇女在政治上和社会上的地位。
    （五）城市和乡村的妇女知识分子，应当努力与劳动妇女结合，与生产事业结合，提高科学知识与技术能力，树立为人民服务的观点。女学生应当努力学习，成为建设新民主主义国家的有用人材。对工农妇女应给以更多的求学机会，培养劳动者出身的新式知识分子。职业妇女应努力学习，精通业务，善尽其职，以自己工作的表现来开辟与巩固妇女参加各种社会职业的道路。要吸收知识和劳动妇女分别参加各种训练班、学习会、研究所、培养大批优秀的女教师、女职员、女经济工作者、助产士、医生、保育工作者等，为新社会的建设事业而服务。要克服知识妇女轻视劳动的旧思想，须重视与工农结合的必要，组织女干部深入工厂和农村，为广大劳动妇女及儿童服务，以达到沟通并促进城乡文化的发展。
    （六）在解放区的农村中，我们同意一九四八年十二月中国共产党中央委员会“关于解放区农村妇女工作的决定”，该决定着重指出了老解放区妇女，应以积极参加生产为一切工作的中心环节，在组织妇女参加生产过程中，要善于同反对束缚妇女的封建残余的斗争相结合，提高妇女政治文化水平，动员他们积极参加民主建政，推进妇婴卫生，使农村妇女获得更进一步的解放。新解放区在初期的反恶霸、反土匪的斗争及以后的减租减息、分配土地的斗争中，均必须动员和组织妇女参加，并与劳动生产相结合。这一决定的方针，应当成为各解放区妇女团体在农村中工作的方针，并努力贯彻执行。
    （七）现在尚在国民党残余反动势力下受压迫的妇女，过着极端痛苦的生活，迫切的要求解放。这里妇女工作者的任务，应当指出妇女痛苦的根源，使他们认清解放的道路，并善于运用各种方式，团结自己，和人民一道，为着改善自己的生活，为着反对美帝国主义的侵略与国民党的残余反动势力，为着配合人民解放军的前进而进行适当的斗争。
    （八）根据中国革命发展的形势和妇女运动发展的需要，大会决定成立中华全国民主妇女联合会，它是全中国各阶层各界民主妇女联合的统一战线的组织，是中国妇女第一次全国代表大会选出的最高领导机关。它必须以城乡劳动妇女为基础，密切地联系和团结全国各阶层的民主妇女大众，忠诚地贯彻执行本届大会的决议，为新民主主义革命在全中国的胜利而奋斗。大会认为：解放区城乡的地方性妇女组织，应以妇女代表会议为主要形式，这种妇女代表会议，是全国民主妇女联合会的主要基础组织。
    （九）三年来中国民主妇女运动与国际民主妇女运动的联系是有进步的，这对于反对世界法西斯残余、拥护国际和平民主运动是有重大意义的，今后必须更进一步地加强与国际民主妇女运动，特别是亚洲各国民主妇女运动的联系，以粉碎帝国主义制造新战争的阴谋，争取世界的持久和平。
