Speed Up the Completion of Economic Crop Planting Plan
Neihuang Rushes to Plant Peanuts
Explaining that planting peanuts is beneficial to oneself and the country, which inspired the masses' enthusiasm for planting.
[Ji Lu Yu Electric] The masses in Neihuang are now working hard to plant 130,000 mu of peanuts. This county is a major peanut-producing area. Of the county's 600,000 mu of cultivated land, more than 260,000 mu of green sandy land is suitable for planting peanuts. Last year, with the assistance of government loans and seeds, the masses in the county planted a total of more than 20,000 mu of peanuts. In this year's economic crop production increase plan, the peanut planting area in the county is 130,000 mu, which is more than six times the peanut planting area last year. In order to complete this plan, the government has strengthened its support for peanut planting in the county. The state-owned Defengyu Store purchased and lent 200,000 jin of peanut seeds, and also allocated a portion of peanut loan grain and peanut loans. The masses who received the grain loans eagerly used the grain to purchase peanut seeds. With the majority of seeds resolved, the masses in Neihuang County began planting immediately after Grain Rain. After more than 20 days of labor, most of the planting has now been completed. Approximately 90,000 mu of peanuts have already been planted in the county. According to a survey in the Fourth District, of the 46 villages in the district, 14 villages have planted 40 percent of their total cultivated land, and 12 villages can plant 30 percent.
In the implementation of this peanut planting plan in the county, the rural branches played a significant role. In addition to playing an exemplary role, party members also conducted in-depth mobilization work among the masses. For example, the original plan for Tuzhen Village in the Third District was to plant 450 mu of peanuts, but the masses only reported 370 mu, which was 80 mu short of the plan. The village party secretary immediately led the seven party members in the village to understand the planting capacity of each household, what ideological concerns they had, etc., and then mobilized and explained to them in detail the benefits of planting more peanuts for their own production and the usefulness for national construction. As a result, many households who originally had ideological concerns (such as fear that the government would buy at low prices in the autumn, that planting too much would make peanuts cheap, that they would not be able to sell them, etc.), and therefore did not plant or planted less, planted after their concerns were dispelled, and those who planted less increased their planting. In this way, Tuzhen Village smoothly completed the peanut planting plan. Under the leadership of the village branch, many households in Yuzhuang Village in the Third District completed the peanut planting exceeding the plan. Middle peasant Shi Tongxin planted two mu of peanuts last year, but this year he planted nine mu. The village's planting plan was 400 mu, but the result was 509 mu. In leading the masses to plant, cadres in other districts mostly paid attention to solving the specific planting difficulties of the masses on the one hand, and understanding and solving the ideological concerns of the masses on the other, explaining the Party's policy of rewarding production, pointing out the benefits of planting peanuts, and inspiring the masses' planting interest and enthusiasm from the masses' personal experiences. For example, Qi Xiushan, a farmer in Zhuanghu Village, planted three mu of peanuts last year with the help of a government loan, and harvested 14 cloth bags per mu, greatly improving his life. This year, when the topic of planting peanuts was mentioned, Qi Xiushan happily told everyone, "I turned myself over once during the land reform, and planting peanuts has made me even better." The leadership used this as an example to mobilize the masses, and the peanut planting in these villages generally went very smoothly.
However, some districts and villages did not do well in this regard. For example, some cadres did not go deep down to carry out specific leadership, but were only satisfied with mobilizing and calling on the masses to plant spontaneously, without carrying out organizational leadership, and therefore failed to win full planting. Some cadres had a task-oriented view ideologically, and simple coercion occurred. Due to the influence of this bad style, it had created the illusion among a few farmers of "planting peanuts for the government." Because of this bias, they did not try to find various ways to solve the specific difficulties of the masses, and they did not go deep into understanding and persuading and mobilizing the various ideological concerns of the masses, and they became discouraged when they encountered difficulties. These two biases have begun to attract the attention of the local leadership for correction.

    加紧完成经济作物种植计划
    内黄赶种花生
    说明种花生对自己和国家都有利，启发了群众播种的热情。
    【冀鲁豫电】内黄群众现正为十三万亩的花生播种进行紧张劳动。该县为盛产花生地区，全县耕地六十余万亩适宜播种花生的青沙地二十六万余亩。去年该县群众在政府贷款贷种扶助下，共播种花生二万余亩，今年该县经济作物增产计划中，全县花生播种面积为十三万亩，超过去年花生播种面积的六倍以上。为完成这一计划，政府对该县花生播种加强扶植，国营德丰裕商店购贷二十万斤花生种籽，另拨花生贷粮及花生贷款各一部，贷到粮食的群众，争先踊跃的以粮食转购花生种。由于种籽的大部解决，内黄全县群众自谷雨起，即已开始点种，经过二十余天的劳动，现已种完大部，该县大约有九万亩花生业已下种。据四区调查，全区四十六个村中，有十四个村已种到耕地总面积的百分之四十，有十二个村可种到百分之三十。
    此次该县花生播种计划的贯彻中，农村支部起了很大作用，党员除起到模范带头作用外，并向群众进行了深入的动员工作。如三区土镇村原计划播种花生四百五十亩，结果群众只自报三百七十亩，按计划尚差八十亩。村支书即领导本村七个党员分头了解各户的播种能力，有何思想顾虑等，然后加以动员解释，详细说明多种花生对本身生产的利益和对国家建设的用处，结果，有好多户原先因思想上有顾虑（如怕秋后政府低价收买、种的多了花生贱、卖不出去…………等），因而不种或少种的，经解除顾虑后，不种的种了，种少的又增加了。这样土镇村便顺利完成了花生播种计划。三区余庄群众在村支部领导下，许多户的花生播种均超计划完成。中农史同心，去年种花生二亩，今年则种九亩，全村播种计划为四百亩，结果完成五百零九亩。其他各区干部在领导群众播种中，大部均注意了一方面解决群众的具体播种困难，一方面了解并解决群众的思想顾虑，说明党的奖励生产政策，指出种花生的利益，从群众切身体验中，启发群众的播种兴趣和热情。如庄湖村农民齐秀山，去年由于政府贷款帮助他种了三亩花生，每亩收十四布袋，生活大见改善。今年一提种花生，齐秀山高兴地到处对人说：“土改时我翻了一次身，种花生又翻的更好了。”领导以此为例，动员群众，这些村庄的花生播种一般均很顺利。
    但也有部分区村在这方面做的不好，如有些干部没有深入下去进行具体领导，只满足于动员号召，听任群众自发的播种，而不去进行组织领导，因而未能争取充分下种。有的干部思想上存在着任务观点，发生了简单强迫命令的现象。由于这种恶劣作风的影响，曾在少数农民中造成“为政府种花生”的错觉。由于这种偏向存在，对群众的具体困难也就不去想各种办法求得解决，对群众的各种思想顾虑也就不去深入了解进行说服动员，碰到困难就灰心丧气。这两个偏向已开始引起该地领导上注意纠正。
