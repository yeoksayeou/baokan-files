　　Unite and Struggle to Overcome Disasters
  　Jinnan Eliminates Insect Pests
  　Taiyue Replants to Rescue from Frost Damage
    [Jinnan Electric Dispatch] Farmers in Jinnan are paying close attention to the control of insect pests while resisting drought and planting. Recently, due to unfavorable weather conditions, many areas have experienced renewed insect infestations in wheat seedlings. In the second district of Ningnan, locust nymphs were discovered in four or five villages. The district immediately mobilized eight villages, with 880 people, to dig ditches and block them, completely eradicating them in two days. Areas with locust eggs were urged to quickly cultivate the land. Areas where plowing was not possible, such as the edges of fields, roadsides, and threshing grounds, were turned over once with shovels and hoes to prevent regeneration. At the same time, waterwheels and winches were mobilized day and night for irrigation. The entire village of Baifang in the first district has already irrigated their wheat fields twice and are now rushing to irrigate a third time. Villages along the river are vigorously opening water barriers and dams to divert water for wheat irrigation. The county has already irrigated over 94,000 mu of wheat fields, and all insect and disease disasters have been eliminated. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Longyao, large numbers of locust nymphs emerged. The county immediately established district and village insect control committees to provide specialized leadership. In the fourth district, the masses were mobilized to first dig over 600 zhang of ditches to completely surround the insects, then drive the insects into the ditches and crush them with stone rollers, quickly eliminating them all. Before catching insects, Yuanchao and Hengshui organized labor, such as in Yangcun and other three villages in the fourth district of Yuanchao, where women and children swept the insects forward with brooms, while able-bodied men followed behind and pushed with hoes. Using this method, the first district of Hengshui has eliminated twelve mu of fire spiders and resolved the contradiction between sowing and pest control. However, it is essential to ideologically mobilize the masses for smooth pest control. For example, in Wujiazhuang village in the second district and Zhangjiazhuang village in the third district of the county, the masses initially only focused on sowing and were unwilling to catch insects. The leadership did not explain the relationship between sowing and seedling protection and the fact that the spread of insect plagues would harm the entire village, so the farmers' enthusiasm was not high. Cadres and the masses in Houying village in the fourth district of Yuanchao understood the principle of "no insect eradication, no seedling protection," and quickly eliminated all insect pests in 150 mu of wheat fields. The farmers happily said, "As long as people are of one mind, the root of the insects will be cut off!" In addition, insect pests in some villages in Handan, Guangping, Ji County, and other counties have also been promptly eliminated under the active leadership of the county and districts and the efforts of the masses in catching and beating.
    [Jinnan Electric Dispatch] Jinnan has not yet had soaking rain, and some districts and villages have experienced wind and insect disasters. Local leaders are making every effort to quickly organize the masses to fight against various disasters and protect seedlings. In Linqing, Wuxun, and other counties in the first special district, and in some villages in the third, fourth, and fifth special districts, many cotton seedlings have been damaged or killed by wind and drought. In the first special district, all counties are mobilizing farmers to tamp the soil firmly around the cotton seedlings, build dams on top to avoid wind and sand, hoe the seedlings in advance, continue to dig soil, and water the seedlings. Xin County proposed that "seedling protection does not count as completing the task," breaking the cadres' slack mood after a concentrated rush to plant, and calling on everyone to water one mu of seedlings to keep them alive. Currently, the first district has used the "stealing irrigation" method (poking holes around the seedlings and watering with pots) to irrigate 1,029 mu. Huo Zhuang in the sixth district started early, and all the cotton seedlings in the village have been watered once. Daming, Wei County, Zhentang, and Julu have launched a "one pot of water per seedling" watering campaign. The Fifth Prefectural Committee instructed all counties to elevate seedling protection to the same importance as planting.

  　冀南虫害消灭
  　太岳补种抢救冻灾
    【冀南电】冀南各地农民在抗旱点种中，随时注意除治虫害。近因风雨不调，不少地区麦苗续生虫害。宁南二区有四五个村发现蝗蝻，该区立即动员八个村，八百八十人挖沟封锁，两天全部捕灭。有蝗卵地方号召群众迅速耕地，不能行犁的地头、道边、土场，用锨和＠倒一遍，以防再生。同时动员水车辘轳日夜赶浇，一区柏房全村麦地已浇过两水，现正赶浇三水，沿河村庄则大力开水挡坝引水浇麦，全县已浇麦地九万四千余亩，一切虫、病灾均告消灭。隆尧四、五、六三个区均生大批蝗蝻，该县当即成立区村捕虫委员会专门领导，四区发动群众先挖沟六百余丈，将虫全数包围好，然后将虫驱至沟内用石滚轧，很快全部消灭。元朝、衡水在捕虫前即有组织的进行分工，如元朝四区杨村等三村妇女儿童在前用扫帚赶，壮年在后边用锄推，衡水一区用此法已消灭十二亩火蜘蛛，并解决了播种与除虫的矛盾。但必须注意从思想上发动群众，打虫才能顺利进行，如该县二区武家庄、三区张家庄等村群众开始只顾播种，不愿捕虫，领导上没有说明播种与保苗的关系及虫灾蔓延会为害全村的道理，因而农民的积极性不高。元朝四区后营村干部群众都领会了“不灭虫苗不保”的道理，一百五十亩麦田中的虫害，很快即全部消灭。农民都喜欢的说：“只要人齐心，虫就断了根！”此外，邯郸、广平、冀县等县部分村庄的虫害，也在县区积极领导及群众努力捕打下，及时消灭。
    【冀南电】冀南至今未落透雨，部分区村发生风、虫等灾害，各地领导正全力迅速组织群众向各种灾害作斗争，保护幼苗。一专区临清、武训等县及三、四、五专区部分村庄因风、旱损害，死伤棉苗甚多。一专区各县动员农民在棉苗周围用脚踩结实，在上头筑坝以避风沙。并提前锄苗，继续挖土并浇苗。莘县提出苗不保不算完成任务，打破了干部在突击抢种后的松懈情绪，号召每人浇活一亩苗。现一区已用“偷浇”（在苗周围扎眼用壶灌水）办法浇一零二九亩。六区霍庄下手早，全村棉苗已普浇一遍。大名、魏县、振堂、巨鹿开展了“一株苗一壶水”的浇苗运动。五地委指示各县把保苗提到与点种同等重要的地位。
