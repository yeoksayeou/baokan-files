Editor's Note: The May Fourth Movement is now thirty years old. How should we understand the nature of this movement, assess its historical significance and influence, and how should we inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the May Fourth Movement in the future, and strive for the final and complete victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause? All these issues have been given brilliant instructions in the remarks of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, regarding the May Fourth Movement. In order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, these remarks are compiled and published successively for study and research.

The May Fourth Movement was an anti-imperialist movement and an anti-feudal movement. The outstanding historical significance of the May Fourth Movement lies in its posture that the Xinhai Revolution did not possess, that is, thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialism and thorough and uncompromising anti-feudalism. The May Fourth Movement possessed this nature because China's capitalist economy had further developed at that time, and China's revolutionary intellectuals had witnessed the disintegration of the three major imperialist countries, Russia, Germany, and Austria, and the injury of the two major imperialist countries, Britain and France, and the Russian proletariat had established a socialist country, and the proletariat of Germany, Austria (Hungary), and Italy were in revolution, thus giving rise to new hopes for China's national liberation. The May Fourth Movement was one of the calls of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian Revolution, and under the call of Lenin. The May Fourth Movement was a part of the world proletarian revolution at that time. Although there was no Chinese Communist Party during the May Fourth Movement, there were already a large number of intellectuals who approved of the Russian Revolution and had preliminary communist ideas. At its beginning, the May Fourth Movement was a united front revolutionary movement of three groups: communist intellectuals, revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals (who were the right wing at that time). Its weakness lay in being limited to intellectuals, without the participation of workers and peasants. But when it developed into the June 3rd Movement, it was not only intellectuals, but also a large number of proletariat, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie who participated, becoming a national revolutionary movement. The cultural revolution of the May Fourth Movement was a thorough movement against feudal culture. Since the history of China, there has never been such a great and thorough cultural revolution. At that time, taking opposition to old morality and advocating new morality, opposition to old literature and advocating new literature as the two major banners of the cultural revolution, it established great merits. This cultural movement was not possible to popularize among the workers and peasants at that time. It put forward the slogan of "vernacular literature," but the so-called "common people" at that time could actually only be limited to the urban petty-bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals, that is, the intellectuals of the so-called urban class. The May Fourth Movement prepared the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 in terms of ideology and cadres, and also prepared the May 30th Movement and the Northern Expedition. The bourgeois intellectuals at that time, who were the right wing of the May Fourth Movement, compromised with the enemy and stood on the reactionary side in the second period.

Before the May Fourth Movement in 1919 (the May Fourth Movement occurred after the First Imperialist War in 1914 and the Russian October Revolution in 1917), the political leaders of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution were the Chinese petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie (their intellectuals). At this time, the Chinese proletariat had not yet stepped onto the political stage as a conscious and independent class force, but participated in the revolution as followers of the petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie. For example, the proletariat during the Xinhai Revolution was such a class.

After the May Fourth Movement, the political leaders of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution were mainly no longer belonging to the Chinese bourgeoisie as a class, but the Chinese proletariat participated in it. At this time, the Chinese proletariat, due to its own growth and the influence of the Russian Revolution, had rapidly become a conscious and independent political force. The slogan of overthrowing imperialism and the thorough program of the entire Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution were put forward by the Chinese Communist Party; and the implementation of the land revolution was carried out solely by the Chinese Communist Party.

On the Chinese cultural front or ideological front, the period before and after the May Fourth Movement is divided into two different historical periods.

Before the May Fourth Movement, the struggle on the Chinese cultural front was the struggle between the new culture of the bourgeoisie and the old culture of the feudal class. Before the May Fourth Movement, the struggle between schools and imperial examinations, the struggle between new learning and old learning, and the struggle between Western learning and Chinese learning all carried this nature. The so-called schools, new learning, and Western learning at that time were basically bourgeois natural sciences and social sciences (saying basically means that there were still many Chinese feudal remnants mixed in them). Darwin's theory of evolution introduced by Yan Fu, Adam Smith's classical economics, Muller's formal logic, and the social theories of French Enlightenment scholars such as Montesquieu were representatives, plus the natural sciences at that time, were the dominant ideas of the so-called new learning before the May Fourth Movement. At that time, this kind of thought had a revolutionary effect in fighting against Chinese feudal thought, and it served the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution in the old period. However, because of the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the world had entered the era of imperialism, this bourgeois thought could only go into battle for a few rounds before being defeated by the reactionary alliance of foreign imperialist enslavement thought and Chinese feudalist restoration thought. After this ideological reactionary allied force slightly counterattacked, the so-called new learning closed its banners and silenced its drums, declared its retreat, lost its soul, and only its shell remained. The old bourgeois democratic culture had become corrupt and powerless in the era of imperialism, and its failure was inevitable.

After the May Fourth Movement, it was different. After the May Fourth Movement, China produced a completely new cultural force, which was the communist cultural thought led by the Chinese Communists, that is, the communist world view and social revolution theory. The May Fourth Movement was in 1919, the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and the real beginning of the labor movement were in 1921, both after the First World War and the October Revolution, that is, when the national question and the colonial movement in the world changed their past appearances. The connection between this Chinese revolution and the world revolution is very obvious. Because the new political force in China, that is, the Chinese proletariat and the Chinese Communist Party, stepped onto the Chinese political stage, this new cultural force, with new costumes and new weapons, united all possible allies, set up its own battle array, and launched a heroic offensive against imperialist culture and feudal culture. Although this new force has not yet had time to occupy positions and conduct battles in the field of natural science, and generally still allows natural science to be ruled by the bourgeois worldview for the time being; in the field of social science, in the field of the most important ideological weapons in this colonial and semi-colonial revolutionary era, it has caused great revolutions. In the field of social sciences, whether in philosophy, economics, politics, military science, history, literature, or art (whether it is drama, film, music, sculpture, or painting), there has been great development. In the past twenty years, the edge of this new cultural army has caused great revolutions from thought to form (writing, etc.). Its momentum is so great and its power is so fierce that it is simply invincible. Its mobilization is so broad that it exceeds any historical era in China. And Lu Xun is the greatest and most heroic standard-bearer of this new cultural army. Lu Xun is the commander of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer, but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's bones are the hardest. He has no trace of slavishness or flattery. This is the most valuable character of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. Lu Xun is the unprecedented national hero who, on the cultural front, represents the majority of the entire nation and charges into battle against the enemy in the most correct, bravest, most determined, most loyal, and most enthusiastic way. Lu Xun's direction is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation.

Before the May Fourth Movement, China's new culture was a culture of the old democratic nature, belonging to a part of the capitalist cultural revolution of the world's bourgeoisie. After the May Fourth Movement, China's new culture was all of the new democratic nature, belonging to a part of the socialist cultural revolution of the world's proletariat.

Before the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese New Culture Movement, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, was led by the bourgeoisie, and they still had a leading role. After the May Fourth Movement, the cultural thought of this class was even more backward than its political stuff, so there was absolutely no leading role. At most, it played the role of an ally to a certain extent during the revolutionary period. As for the qualifications of the leader of the alliance, it had to fall on the shoulders of the proletarian cultural thought. This is an iron fact that no one can deny.

During the May Fourth Movement, the general new figures opposed classical Chinese, advocated vernacular Chinese, opposed old dogmas, and advocated science and democracy. These were all very correct. At that time, this movement was lively, progressive, and revolutionary. At that time, the ruling class taught students with the principles of Confucius, forcing people to believe in Confucius's set as religious dogmas, and those who wrote articles used classical Chinese. In short, the articles and education of the ruling class and their helpers at that time, whether its content or form, were all stereotyped and dogmatic. This is the old stereotype and old dogma. Exposing the ugly state of this old stereotype and old dogma to the people and calling on the people to rise up against the old stereotype and old dogma was one of the greatest achievements of the May Fourth Movement. The May Fourth Movement was not just this one achievement. It also had the great achievement of opposing imperialism related to this, but opposing the old stereotype and old dogma was one of its great achievements. But later, foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas were produced, and some people in our party developed these foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas into subjective, sectarian, and Party stereotypes. These are all new stereotypes and new dogmas. These many kinds of new stereotypes and new dogmas are deeply rooted in the minds of our comrades, making it take a lot of effort for us to carry out the transformation work today. In this way, the lively, progressive, and revolutionary movement against the feudal old stereotype and old dogma in the May Fourth period was later developed by some people to the extreme, and developed to its opposite, becoming a new stereotype and new dogma. It is no longer a lively thing, but a rigid thing; it is no longer a progressive thing, but a backward thing; it is no longer a revolutionary thing, but a thing that hinders the revolution. That is to say, foreign stereotypes, or Party stereotypes, or new stereotypes, new dogmas, are the reaction of the original nature of the May Fourth Movement. But the May Fourth Movement also has shortcomings. Many of the leading figures at that time did not have the critical spirit of Marxism. The methods they used were generally bourgeois methods, that is, formalistic methods. They opposed the old stereotype and old dogma, and advocated science and democracy, which was very correct; but they did not have the critical spirit of dialectical materialism and historical materialism towards the status quo, history, and foreign affairs. Bad is absolutely bad, everything is bad; good is absolutely good, everything is good. This formalistic way of looking at problems affected the development of the movement later. The development road of the May Fourth Movement was divided into two trends. A part of people inherited the spirit of science and democracy of the May Fourth Movement, and transformed it on the basis of Marxism. This is what the Communists and some non-Party Marxists did. Another part of people went to the road of the bourgeoisie, which is the right wing, which is the development of formalism to the right wing. But it was not consistent within the Communist Party, and some people also went to extremes. They did not grasp Marxism firmly and made formalistic mistakes. This is subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party stereotypes. This is the development of formalism to the "left" wing. In this way, Party stereotypes are, on the one hand, a reaction to the positive factors of the May Fourth Movement, and on the other hand, also an inheritance, continuation, or development of the negative factors of the May Fourth Movement. It is not a coincidence. It is beneficial for us to understand this point. If it was revolutionary and necessary to oppose the old stereotype and old dogmatism in the May Fourth period, then it is also revolutionary and necessary for us to criticize the new stereotype and new dogmatism today. If we did not oppose the old stereotype and old dogmatism in the May Fourth period, the thoughts of the Chinese people would not be liberated from the shackles of the old stereotype and old dogmatism, and China would not have the hope of freedom and independence. This work was only a beginning in the May Fourth Movement period. It will take a lot of effort to completely free the people of the whole country from the rule of the old stereotype and old dogmatism. It is still a major project on the road of revolutionary transformation in the future. If we do not oppose the new stereotype and new dogmatism today, then the thoughts of the Chinese people will be bound by another extremism. Isn't the harm of foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas obvious to everyone? As for the poison of Party stereotypes and the mistakes of dogmatism committed by some (of course, only a part) of the comrades in our party, if they are not removed, then the lively revolutionary spirit cannot be inspired, the bad habit of treating Marxism with an incorrect attitude cannot be eliminated, and the true Marxism cannot be widely disseminated and developed, and we cannot effectively struggle against the influence of the old stereotype and old dogma among the people of the whole country, and the influence of foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas among many people in the whole country, and we cannot achieve the goal of destroying and clearing these things.

    毛泽东同志论“五四”运动
    编者按：“五四”运动到现在三十周年了，我们怎样认识这个运动的性质，估价其历史意义和影响，今后如何承继并发扬“五四”运动中的光荣传统，争取中国人民解放事业最后的与彻底的胜利，——所有这些，在中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东关于“五四”运动的言论中都有过英明的指示。为了纪念“五四”运动三十周年，特将这些言论汇集陆续发表以供学习、研究。            
    “五四”运动是反帝国主义的运动，又是反封建的运动。“五四”运动的杰出的历史意义，在于它带着为辛亥革命还不曾有的姿态，这就是彻底的不妥协的反帝国主义与彻底的不妥协的反封建。“五四”运动所以具有这种性质，是因当时中国的资本主义经济已有进一步的发展，而当时中国的革命知识阶级又眼见得俄、德、奥三大帝国主义国家已经瓦解，英法两大帝国主义国家已经受伤，而俄国无产阶级已经建立了社会主义国家，德、奥（匈牙利）、意三国无产阶级在革命中，因而发生了中国民族解放的新希望。“五四”运动是在当时世界革命号召之一，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的。“五四”运动是当时无产阶级世界革命的一部份。“五四”运动时期虽然还没有中国共产党，但是已经有了大批的赞成俄国革命的具有初步共产主义思想的知识分子。“五四”运动，在其开始，是共产主义的知识分子、革命的小资产阶级知识分子与资产阶级知识分子（他们是当时的右翼）三部份人的统一战线革命运动。它的弱点，就在只限于知识分子，没有工人农民参加。但发展到“六三”运动时，就不但是知识分子，而有广大的无产阶级小资产阶级与资产阶级参加，成了全国范围的革命运动了。“五四”运动的文化革命则是彻底反对封建文化的运动，自有中国历史以来，还没有过这样伟大而彻底的文化革命。当时以反对旧道德提倡新道德，反对旧文学提倡新文学，为文化革命的两大旗帜，建立了伟大的功劳。这个文化运动，当时还没有可能普及到工农群众中去。它提出了“平民文学”口号，但是当时的所谓“平民”，实际上还只能限于城市小资产阶级与资产阶级的知识分子，即所谓市民阶级的知识分子。“五四”运动是在思想上与干部上准备了一九二一年中国共产党的成立，又准备了“五卅”运动与北伐战争。当时的资产阶级知识分子，他们是“五四”运动的右翼，到了第二时期，他们中间的大部份就与敌人妥协，站在反动方面了。

    在一九一九年五四运动以前（五四运动发生于一九一四年第一次帝国主义大战与一九一七年俄国十月革命之后），中国资产阶级民主革命的政治指导者是中国的小资产阶级与资产阶级（他们的知识分子）。这时，中国无产阶级还没有当作一个觉悟了的独立的阶级力量登上政治的舞台，还是当作小资产阶级与资产阶级的追随者参加了革命。例如辛亥革命时的无产阶级，就是这样的阶级。
    在五四运动以后，中国资产阶级民主革命的政治指导者，主要的已经不是属于中国资产阶级一个阶级，而有中国无产阶级参加进去了。这时，中国无产阶级，由于自己的长成，与俄国革命的影响，已经迅速地变成了一个觉悟了的独立的政治力量了。打倒帝国主义的口号与整个中国资产阶级民主革命的彻底的纲领，是中国共产党提出的；而土地革命的实行，则是中国共产党单独进行的。

    在中国文化战线或思想战线上，“五四”以前与“五四”以后，划分了两个不同的历史时期。
    在“五四”以前，中国文化战线上的斗争，是资产阶级的新文化与封建阶级的旧文化的斗争。在“五四”以前，学校与科举之争，新学与旧学之争，西学与中学之争，都带着这种性质。那时的所谓学校、新学、西学，基本上都是资产阶级的自然科学与社会科学（说基本上，是说那中间还夹杂了许多中国的封建余毒在内）。以严复输入的达尔文的进化论，亚丹斯密斯的古典经济学，穆勒的形式逻辑与法国启蒙学者孟德斯鸠辈的社会论为代表，加上那时自然科学，是“五四”以前所谓新学的统治思想。在当时这种思想，有同中国封建思想作斗争的革命作用，是替旧时期的中国资产阶级民主革命服务的。可是因为中国资产阶级的无力与世界已经进到帝国主义时代，这种资产阶级思想只能上阵打几个回合，就被外国帝国主义的奴化思想与中国封建主义的复古思想的反动同盟所打退了，被这个思想上的反动同盟军稍稍一反攻，所谓新学就掩旗息鼓，宣告退却，失了灵魂，而只剩下它的躯壳了。旧的资产阶级民主主义文化，在帝国主义时代，已经腐化，已经无力了，它的失败是必然的。
    “五四”以后则不然。在“五四”以后，中国产生了完全崭新的文化生力军，这就是中国共产党人所领导的共产主义的文化思想，即共产主义的世界观与社会革命论。五四运动是在一九一九年，中国共产党的成立与劳动运动的真正开始是在一九二一年，均在第一次世界大战与十月革命之后，即在民族问题与殖民地运动在世界上改变了过去面貌之时，这种中国革命与世界革命的联系，是非常之显然的。由于中国政治生力军即中国无产阶级与中国共产党登上了中国的政治舞台，这个文化生力军，就以新的装束与新的武器，联合一切可能的同盟军，摆开了自己的阵势，向着帝国主义文化与封建文化展开了英勇的进攻。这支生力军虽然还没有来得及在自然科学领域占领阵地与进行战斗，一般的暂时还让自然科学为资产阶级的宇宙观所统治；但在社会科学领域，在这个殖民地半殖民地革命时代最重要的思想武器的领域，却引起了极大的革命。在社会科学领域中，不论在哲学方面，在经济学方面，在政治学方面，在军事学方面，在历史学方面，在文学方面，在艺术方面（又不论是戏剧，是电影，是音乐，是雕刻，是绘画），都有了极大的发展。二十年来，这个文化新军的锋芒所向，从思想到形式（文字等），无不起了极大的革命。其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，简直是所向无敌的。其动员之广大，超过中国任何历史时代。而鲁迅，就是这个文化新军的最伟大与最英勇的旗手。鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家与伟大的革命家。鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜与媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。
    在“五四”以前，中国的新文化，是旧民主主义性质的文化，属于世界资产阶级的资本主义的文化革命的一部份。在“五四”以后，中国的新文化，都是新民主主义性质的文化，属于世界无产阶级的社会主义的文化革命的一部份。
    在“五四”以前，中国的新文化运动，中国的文化革命，是资产阶级领导的，他们还有领导作用。在“五四”以后，这个阶级的文化思想却比较它的政治上的东西还要落后，就绝无领导作用，至多在革命时期在一定程度上充当一个盟员，至于盟长资格，就不得不落在无产阶级文化思想的肩上。这是铁一般事实，谁也否认不了的。

    五四运动时期，一般新人物反对文言文，提倡白话文，反对旧教条，提倡科学与民主，这些都是很对的。在那时，这个运动是生动活泼的，前进的，革命的。那时的统治阶级都拿孔夫子的道理教学生，把孔夫子的一套当作宗教教条一样强迫人民信奉，作文章的人都用文言文。总之那时的统治阶级及其帮闲们的文章和教育，不论它的内容与形式，都是八股式的，教条式的。这就是老八股，老教条。揭穿这种老八股，老教条的丑态给人民看，号召人民起来反对老八股老教条，这就是五四运动时期的一个极大的功绩。五四运动不止这一个功绩，它还有与这相联系的反对帝国主义的大功绩，但反对老八股老教条是它的大功绩之一。但到后来就产生了洋八股，洋教条，我们党的一些人则发展这种洋八股，洋教条成了主观主义宗派主义与党八股的东西。这些就都是新八股、新教条。这许多种新八股、新教条，在我们同志的头脑中弄得根深蒂固，使我们今天要进行改造工作还要费很大的气力。这样看来，五四时期生动活泼的前进的革命的反对封建的老八股、老教条的运动，后来被一些人发展到了极端，发展到了它的反对方面，成了新八股、新教条。不是生动活泼的东西，而是死硬的东西了；不是前进的东西，而是后退的东西了；不是是革命的东西，而是阻碍革命的东西了。这就是说，洋八股、或党八股，或新八股，新教条，是五四运动本来性质的反动。但五四运动也是有缺点的。许多那时的领导人物，还没有马克思主义的批判精神，他们使用的方法，一般地还是资产阶级的方法即形式主义的方法。他们反对旧八股，旧教条，主张科学与民主，是很对的；但他们对于现状，对于历史，对于外国事物，没有辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的批判精神，坏就是绝对的坏，一切皆坏；好就是绝对的好，一切皆好。这种形式主义地看问题的方法，就影响了后来这个运动的发展。五四运动的发展路上分成了两个潮流，一部份人继承了五四运动的科学与民主的精神，并在马克思主义的基础上面给了改造，这就是共产党人及若干党外马克思主义者所做的工作。另一部份人则走到资产阶级的道路上去，这就是右翼，是形式主义向右翼的发展。但在共产党内也不是一致的，其中也有一部份人走极端，马克思主义没有拿得稳，犯了形式主义的错误，这就是主观主义、宗派主义与党八股，这就是形式主义向“左”翼的发展。这样看来，党八股这种东西，一方面是五四运动的积极因素的反动，一方面也是五四运动的消极因素的继承、继续或发展，并不是偶然的东西。我们懂得这一点是有好处的。如果五四时期反对老八股、老教条主义是革命的和必需的，那么，今天我们来批判新八股、新教条主义也是革命的和必需的。如果五四时期不反对老八股、老教条主义，中国人民的思想就不能从老八股、老教条主义的束缚下面获得解放，中国就不会有自由独立的希望。这个工作，五四运动时期还不过是一个开端，要使全国人民完全脱离老八股、老教条主义的统治，还须费很大的气力，还是今后革命改造路上的一个大工程。如果我们今天不反对新八股、新教条主义，则中国人民的思想又将受另一个极端主义的束缚。洋八股、洋教条的为害之大，不是大家看见了的吗？至于我们党内一部份（当然只是一部份）同志所中的党八股的毒，所犯的教条主义的错误，如果不除去，那么，生动活泼的革命精神就不能启发，拿不正确态度对待马克思主义的恶习就不能肃清，真正的马克思主义就不能得到广泛的传播与发展，而对于老八股老教条在全国人民中间的影响，以及洋八股洋教条在全国许多人中间的影响，也就不能进行有力的斗争，对于这些东西的摧陷廓清，也就达不到目的。
