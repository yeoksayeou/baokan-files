Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw dispatch: Workers and peasants throughout Poland are helping each other. Since last autumn, 22,000 workers from Krakow in the south have regularly visited the countryside. They repair tractors, harvesters, etc. in the countryside, and establish branches of the Polish Women's League or the Youth League in the countryside. Farmers invite them to discuss issues related to rural economy and culture at meetings. The Krakow Red Cross also helps farmers. With the assistance of the Municipal Health Bureau and local Polish United Workers' Party organizations, they are sending mobile teams of doctors and nurses to the most remote rural areas. Municipal workers in Gorzów (in Poznań Province) sent 951 first-aid kits to rural areas in the province. Workers at the Roklau-Ilena glass factory in the southwest invited farmers from the village of Weizbiechani to visit the factory and explained the production process to them in detail. They went to the Poznań International Fair with the farmers from the village. The farmers of Weizbiechani then invited all the workers of the Ilena factory to spend the summer in their village.

    【新华社北平十六日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰全国的工人与农民互相进行帮助。从去年秋天以来，南部克拉科两万两千名工人定期地访问了农村。他们在农村修理拖拉机、收割机等，并在农村建立了波兰妇女联盟或青年联盟的分会。农民们则请他们在会议上讨论一些有关农村经济与文化的问题。克拉科红十字会也帮助农民，他们正在市卫生署及当地波兰统一工人党组织的协助之下，派遣医生与护士流动小组到最偏僻的农村中去。哥尔佐（在波斯南省）的市政工人送给该省农村地区九百五十一个急救袋。在西南部罗克劳·伊伦纳玻璃工厂工人曾邀请魏兹比查尼村的农民参观工厂，并向他们详细解释生产过程。他们和该村的农民一道去参观波斯南国际博览会。魏兹比查尼村的农民则回请伊伦纳工厂一切工人在夏天到他们的乡村去。
