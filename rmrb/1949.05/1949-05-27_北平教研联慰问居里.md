    Sends Condolences to Curie
    [Ping City News] The Beiping Education and Research Union sent a telegram to Professor Curie on the 24th, stating approximately: The newspapers these past few days have continuously reported that the French reactionary group, in order to ingratiate themselves with American imperialism, is carrying out all kinds of conspiracy of persecution against you. These shameless conspiracies make us angry. We specially express our warm sympathy and condolences to you, and we believe that the peace forces of the whole world will certainly be your backing to fight to the end with the reactionary groups of the United States and France.
