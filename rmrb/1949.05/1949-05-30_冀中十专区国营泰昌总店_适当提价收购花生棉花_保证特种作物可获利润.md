    Jizhong Electric: The prices of cotton and peanuts in the Tenth Special District in May have not kept pace with the rapid rise in grain prices. For example, on April 20th, 100 jin of cotton in Langfang could be exchanged for 365 jin of corn, and 100 jin of peanuts in Gu'an could be exchanged for 160 jin of corn. By April 27th, 100 jin of cotton in Langfang could only be exchanged for 324 jin of corn, and 100 jin of peanuts in Gu'an could only be exchanged for 134 jin of corn. After discovering this situation, the state-owned Taichang Main Store immediately held a meeting to study how to maintain the production profits of special crops. As a result, it was determined that the current rate should be maintained at around 375 jin of corn for 100 jin of cotton, and 160 jin of corn for 100 jin of peanuts. It was also decided that from May 1st, while selling grain and cloth, the purchase prices of peanuts and cotton would be raised. By the 15th, a total of 203,144 jin of cotton, 2,858.5 jin of white oil, and 5,900 jin of peanuts had been purchased in the four markets of Gu'an, Yongqing, and others. The prices of special crops were raised to: 378 jin of corn for 100 jin of cotton, and 164 jin of corn for 100 jin of peanuts. This fact fully illustrates that the profits from planting special crops are guaranteed.

    冀中十专区国营泰昌总店
    适当提价收购花生棉花
    保证特种作物可获利润
    【冀中电】十专区五月份棉花、花生价格跟不上粮价上涨快，如四月二十日，廊坊百斤棉花可换玉米三百六十五斤，固安百斤花生可换玉米一百六十斤；四月二十七日，廊坊百斤棉花只能换玉米三百二十四斤，固安百斤花生只能换玉米一百三十四斤。国营泰昌总店发现这一情况后，马上开会研究如何保持特种作物的生产利润。结果确定目前保持百斤棉花换玉米三百七十五斤左右，花生百斤换玉米一百六十斤；并决定从五月一日即开始一面售出粮食、布匹，一面提价收购花生、棉花。至十五日，固安、永清等四个市场共购入棉花二十万三千一百四十四斤，白油二千八百五十八斤半，花生五千九百斤。特种作物价格提到：百斤棉花换玉米三百七十八斤，百斤花生换玉米一百六十四斤。这样的事实便充分说明了种植特种作物的利润是有保障的。
