    Datong is located in northern Shanxi Province, between the inner and outer Great Walls. Surrounded by dangerous passes, it is the gateway from Shanxi to Inner Mongolia. Its industry and mining are developed. The PingSui and TongPu railways connect here. The population is about 130,000 (including Kouquan), making it the economic and transportation center and military stronghold of northern Shanxi. Datong is rich in coal reserves, and the quality is excellent. The mining area is around Kouquan, thirty miles southwest of the city. During the Japanese occupation, there were eight electrically mined sites, which were quite large, especially the Yongdingzhuang Mine, which was the largest. Industry includes two power plants, a steel plant at the Longyan Iron Mine, a cement factory, an oil refinery, a material factory, and factories for gunpowder, mica, flour, matches, alcohol, bricks, and tiles. During the Japanese occupation, there were 80,000 to 90,000 industrial workers. After the Yan bandit occupied it, most of the factory machinery was destroyed. Datong is a famous historical city. The Northern Wei Emperor Tuoba ＠ once established his capital here. There are many famous historical sites around the city. The Yungang Grottoes, thirty miles west of the city, contain thousands of stone Buddhas, some several feet tall, others only inches, with exquisite carvings, treasured by China and foreign countries alike. Datong has six secondary schools with a thousand students.
