　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Military Commission's Railway Department convened the Northern Factories Conference yesterday (the 23rd) at the Railway Department's Second Branch. The conference is scheduled to last for five days. Attendees included over 100 representatives from the relevant bureaus and departments of the Railway Department, as well as the Changxindian and Tangshan Railway Machinery Plants, and the Motive Power Department of the Pingjin Railway Bureau. The central focus of this conference is: (1) establishing a factory responsibility system; (2) studying production capacity, improving production efficiency, and formulating production plans; and (3) organizing and streamlining organizational and personnel systems and other work matters, such as equipment, materials, accounting, and simplifying and unifying the content and format of various forms. The conference held a preparatory meeting yesterday (the 23rd) morning, forming five groups: personnel organization, management, equipment, materials, and accounting reports. The official opening ceremony took place at 2:00 PM. Minister Teng Daiyuan delivered a speech first (full text to be published separately), followed by a speech by Vice Minister Lü Zhengcao, who first introduced the achievements of railway construction in the Northeast, and emphasized: it is necessary to strengthen production planning, establish a responsibility system, and ensure that everyone is responsible and everything is responsible. He called on all employees to learn from the experience of railway construction in the Northeast. He said: "The speed on the Northeast lines has doubled, and the Northeast locomotive personnel have improved to become locomotive scientists. We currently have too few scientists, like 'phoenix feathers and unicorn horns'. What we require is not 'phoenix feathers and unicorn horns' but 'cartloads and bucketfuls'." He called on "everyone to do a good job in the factories, transforming them into new factories, new people, and new appearances." He also hoped that the representatives would conduct more research on the problem of curved rail manufacturing. Group discussions then commenced. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.
