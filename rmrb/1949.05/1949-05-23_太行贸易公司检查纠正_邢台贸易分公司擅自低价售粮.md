Taihang Trading Company Inspects and Corrects
　　Xingtai Trading Branch Company Sells Grain at Low Prices Without Authorization
　　[Taihang Telegram] After seeing the article "Taihang Xingtai Trading Company Sells Grain to Private Merchants at Low Prices, Disrupting Shijiazhuang Market" published in the People's Daily on April 10th, the Taihang Trading Company immediately sent Comrade Hao Lisheng, Chief of the Data Section of the District Company, to the Xingtai Branch Company for inspection. The results of the inspection are reported below. At the end of February, the District Company telegraphed the Xingtai Branch Company to transfer a sum of money. After receiving the task, the branch company encountered a shortage of currency and a market trend towards price increases, making it difficult to sell goods in large quantities. However, the District Company's task of transferring funds was very urgent. Therefore, it consulted with the Shijiazhuang Trading Company by telephone and letter to sell a large batch of grain to Shijiazhuang at a lower price. After the General Manager and Deputy Manager of the Shijiazhuang Trading Company replied "No," the branch company, simply to complete the task of transferring funds, neglected the overall economic measures to take care of neighboring areas. Its overall thinking was blurred, and it separated the administrative area from the economic area. It sold a large batch of grain in Macun, Yuanshi (Note: Yuanshi is administratively under the Xingtai district, but in terms of natural economic exchange, it belongs to Shijiazhuang), determining the price according to the Xingtai price. It did not specifically consult with the Shijiazhuang Trading Company beforehand to unify control of prices and provide mutual support, so the grain price difference with Shijiazhuang was relatively large, resulting in private merchants speculating and affecting Shijiazhuang market management. Regarding the above errors, Comrade Liu Yuzhen, Deputy Manager of the branch company (the Manager was not present at the time), and Xu Ershun, Director of the warehouse, both made self-criticisms. Comrade Hao Lisheng, Chief of the Data Section of the District Company, and Feng Kao, Chief of the Business Section of the branch company, went to the Shijiazhuang Trading Company. Both parties made self-criticisms on this matter, and researched issues such as future material exchange and mutual support between the two places. In order to make everyone accept this lesson and educate Comrades Liu and Xu, the District Company has specifically circulated this inspection report to all branches.

　　太行贸易公司检查纠正
  　邢台贸易分公司擅自低价售粮
    【太行电】太行贸易公司见到人民日报四月十日刊载：“太行邢台贸易公司贱价售粮给私商，破坏石庄市场”一文后，即派区公司资料科科长郝力生同志去邢台分公司进行检查，兹将其检查结果报导于下。二月底，区公司曾电令邢台分公司调取一部款，该分公司接到任务后，适值货币缺乏，而市场物价趋向回头，各货不好大量出售；但区公司给予的调款任务又甚迫急，故以电话及书信与石市贸易公司商榷，以较低价格售与石市大批粮食。经石市贸易公司总、副经理回答“不要”后，该分公司即单纯地为了完成调款任务，而忽视了全面的照顾邻区的经济措施，整体思想模糊，把行政区与经济区割裂起来，便在元氏马村出售大批粮食，价格计算上是按邢台价格来确定（按：元氏在行政上是属于邢台分区的，而在经济的自然交流上却属于石市），事先没有与石市贸易公司具体商榷统一掌握价格，相互支援，所以与石市粮价悬殊较大，结果造成私商投机，影响了石市市场管理。对于上述错误，该分公司副经理刘玉振（正经理当时不在），仓库主任徐二顺两同志都分别做了自我检讨后，区公司资料科长郝力生、分公司经营科长冯考两同志到石市贸易公司，对此事双方都作了自我检讨，并将今后两地物资交流，与互相支援结合等问题，进行了研究。为了使大家接受这一教训与教育刘、徐二同志，区公司并特将此检查通报各分支公司。
