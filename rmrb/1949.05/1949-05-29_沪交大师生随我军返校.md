Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. Frontline reporters report: The teachers, students, and staff of Jiaotong University, who have long suffered persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries, returned to the school en masse on the first morning (May 25th) of the People's Liberation Army's entry into Shanghai. In the past two days, more than a thousand students have returned to the school. The Provisional School Affairs Committee has also begun its work. After being driven out of the school by the Kuomintang bandit gang with tanks, machine guns, and bayonets on April 26th, they were scattered and living in the homes of relatives and classmates, or dozens of people were crammed into a small room, waiting for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. This nationally renowned university has now been devastated by the Kuomintang bandit army. Wires were torn or cut, faucets were stolen, feces were all over the ground and in the rooms, and most of the furniture and equipment were destroyed. After returning to the school, students and workers cleaned up and tidied up overnight, posted slogans that had been prepared long ago to welcome the People's Liberation Army, and organized a school protection team to guard the school in cooperation with the People's Liberation Army. Most of the students organized propaganda teams and went out to conduct street propaganda.

　　沪交大师生随我军返校
    【新华社上海二十七日电】前线记者报道：久受国民党反动派迫害的交通大学师生、员工，在解放军进入上海的第一个早晨（二十五日），就纷纷回到学校，在学校里。两天来回校学生已经有一千多人。临时校务委员会也已开始工作。他们从四月二十六日被国民党匪帮用坦克、机枪、刺刀赶出学校后，就流落在亲友同学家里借住，或者几十个人挤在一个亭子间里，等待解放军的到来。这所全国著名的大学，现在已被国民党匪军破坏得乱七八糟。电线被扯走或砍断，自来水龙头被偷走，满地满屋粪便，家具设备也大多毁坏。学生和工友回校后，即连夜打扫整理，张贴早已预备好了的欢迎解放军的标语，并组织护校队协同解放军守护学校，大部学生则组织宣传队，四出进行街头宣传。
