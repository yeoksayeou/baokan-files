Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th - The East China Military Region Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army held a grand welcoming meeting at 5:00 PM on the 11th to welcome General Lin Zun, commander of the uprising Nationalist Navy Second Fleet, and all its officers. General Liu Bocheng, commander of the Military Region, gave instructions in person. In his instructions, Commander Liu first expressed the welcome of the East China Military Region to the officers and soldiers of the Second Fleet who had revolted. He then analyzed that there are now only two kinds of armies in China: one is the anti-people army led by imperialists, feudal classes, and bureaucratic capitalists; the other is the anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist, and anti-bureaucratic-capitalist army of the people led by the proletariat. There is no third kind of army. Commander Liu pointed out that once the Second Fleet revolted, it fundamentally changed its position from an anti-people army to an army serving the people. Therefore, after the fleet revolted, the Kuomintang bandit planes came to bomb, and the Second Fleet retaliated. This shows this transformation. Commander Liu encouraged everyone, saying: The uprising naval officers and soldiers must, on the one hand, recognize that they were once tools against the people, and on the other hand, strengthen their will to serve the people now. Therefore, the uprising naval officers and soldiers must strive to study Chairman Mao's thinking on building a people's army and strive for the construction of the Chinese People's Navy. Next, Wang Yanqing, commander of the 97th Division of the Kuomintang army who revolted last month, spoke. He said excitedly: The Liberation Army serves the people, and everyone is united, and the army and the people are one family, which is really worth learning. I am very ashamed that I used to be a tool of the Kuomintang reactionaries who massacred the people, and I regret that I woke up too late. Now I am determined to catch up and make contributions to the people. Finally, General Lin Zun delivered a speech. He said: "We resolutely support and accept the instructions given to us by Commander Liu. In the future, we must work hard to study Chairman Mao's thinking on building a people's army and strive to the end for the construction of a powerful people's navy." After the welcoming meeting, the Military Region Headquarters hosted a banquet.

    华东军区欢迎起义舰队官兵
    刘伯承将军亲临训话
    号召为建设中国人民海军奋斗
    【新华社南京十二日电】人民解放军华东军区司令部在十一日下午五时，举行盛大欢迎会，欢迎起义的国民党海军第二舰队司令林遵将军及该舰全体官佐。军区司令员刘伯承将军特亲临训话。在训话中，刘司令员首先代表华东军区向第二舰队起义官兵表示欢迎之意，继即分析中国现在只有两种军队，一种是帝国主义者、封建阶级、官僚资产阶级领导的反人民的军队；一种是无产阶级领导的人民大众的反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的军队。此外，再没有任何第三种的军队。刘司令员指出：第二舰队一经起义，就在根本立场上由反人民的军队转变成为人民服务的军队，所以舰队起义后，国民党匪机就来轰炸，而第二舰队也就实行还击。这就表明了这个转变。刘司令员勉励大家说：起义的海军官兵一方面要认识过去曾是反人民的工具，另一方面要加强现在为人民服务的意志。因此，起义的海军官兵要努力学习毛主席建设人民军队的思想，为建设中国人民海军而奋斗。接着，月前起义的国民党军九十七师王晏清师长讲话。他兴奋地说：解放军为人民服务，上下一致，军民一家，实在值得我们学习。我很惭愧，过去曾作了屠杀人民的国民党反动派的工具，很懊悔觉悟得太晚了，现在决心急起直追，为人民立功。最后林遵将军致词。他说：“我们坚决拥护和接受刘司令员给我们的指示，今后一定努力学习毛主席的建设人民军队思想，为建设人民的强大的海军而奋斗到底。”欢迎会结束后，并由军区司令部设宴招待。
