    Peiping City News: After three months of studying revolutionary theory, the faculty and staff of Beiman Girls' High School, in a meeting of all faculty and staff half a month ago, resolved to establish a "Spare-Time Middle School" utilizing their spare time, specifically to promote learning during their spare time for workers in the city, especially female workers. After Director Liu of the Education Bureau agreed, the faculty and staff formed a "Spare-Time Middle School Preparatory Committee" to carry out tasks such as student recruitment and curriculum development. Everyone generously donated money as "school start-up and operating expenses." After enrollment began, the female workers in clothing factories showed high enthusiasm. Workers who lived far away, in order to attend school, voluntarily did not go home after work or moved in with relatives and friends. It is now scheduled to have an entrance exam on May 8th for class placement and grouping. As for all teaching methods and content, they will fully follow the middle school level and the actual needs of the workers.

    平贝满女中教职员
    创办工余中学
    【平市讯】贝满女中教职员经过了三个月革命理论的学习，已在半月前由全体教职员会决议：利用工余时间筹办“工余中学”一所，专为推进本市工人首先是女工在工余时间学习。经教育局柳ｓｈí＠①局长同意后，教职员们即组成“工余中学筹委会”，进行招生和编制课程等工作，大家并慷慨捐钱，作为“学校开办费和经常费”。招生后，被服厂中的女工们情绪高涨。住家很远的工友为了入学，自愿下工后不回家，或搬到亲友家去住。现已定于五月八日作入学测验，以便分班分组。至于一切教学方法和教材内容，将完全依照中学程度和工人实际需要。
