    [By Our Staff Reporter] The First National Congress of the Chinese Youth was inaugurated in Peiping on the 30th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. There were 480 delegates present, including outstanding figures from the five major liberated areas and regions such as Southwest, Southeast, South China, Taiwan, and Malaya, engaged in work in the military, government, production, labor unions, and young women's affairs, as well as scientists, writers, and journalists. Representatives from various democratic parties in China also attended. The congress opened in an atmosphere of unity and excitement. The revolutionary goals of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism proposed during the May Fourth Movement thirty years ago have been basically realized under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The nation's youth are about to gain complete liberation. The delegates present were overjoyed and unanimously expressed their gratitude for the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu was hung in the hall, along with a huge banner that read: "Unite the nation's youth, strive to participate in the construction of a new democratic country, and carry out the thorough victory of the revolution." This pointed out the new tasks for Chinese youth in the new situation. After Comrade Liao Chengzhi announced the opening of the congress, music filled the air, and all the delegates sang "We are Democratic Youth." When they sang, "Millions of youth follow Mao Zedong, forever towards victory, forever towards brightness," the joyful voices shook the walls of the hall. Comrade Feng Wenbin delivered the opening speech on behalf of the Presidium (see separate article). Next, Commander-in-Chief Zhu delivered a speech on behalf of the CCP Central Committee, detailing the basic tasks of Chinese youth at the present time (speech see separate article). Comrade Dong Biwu extended warm greetings to the congress on behalf of the North China People's Government. He used his life-long revolutionary experience to explain that modern Chinese youth are fortunate. He said: "In the past twenty years, China has had the Communist Party and the leadership of the great people's leader, Chairman Mao, combining Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, giving a new look to the Chinese revolution. Modern youth, following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have completely found their correct direction." Chairman Dong said: "Our youth already have a general direction and a general goal, but we also need appropriate organizational forms and working methods to achieve the general direction and general goal. In the past, you have struggled in various work posts and have already achieved great results. This congress should exchange experiences and establish a national leadership organization to improve youth work." Comrade Wu Yuzhang said in an excited tone: "Today's congress is the result of decades of struggle by revolutionary youth in China. In the future, youth must continue to work hard, especially intellectual youth must unite with worker and peasant youth to help them improve their cultural and technical skills. At the same time, young people must study and master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unite as one, and strive to build a new democratic China." Lin Qiangyun, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Qu Mengjue, representative of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, also spoke successively. Mr. Shen Junru of the Democratic League said in his speech: "The history of the past thirty years proves that Chinese youth have the power to transform corrupt old China. Now that a new China has already emerged, I hope that young people will strengthen unity and intensify their studies under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Mr. Ma Xulun of the China Association for Promoting Democracy hoped that young people would inherit and enhance the heroic, thorough, and uncompromising spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and, in the nationwide victory situation, work with the people of the whole country to carry the revolution through to the end. Mr. Huang Yanpei, Mao Dun, Zhang Zhirang, Lu Zhiwei, and others spoke successively, unanimously congratulating the success of the congress, praising the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao over the Chinese revolution and the youth movement, and hoping that young people would unite, give play to the glorious tradition of past hard work, and participate in the construction work of New Democracy.
