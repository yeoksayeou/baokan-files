    Ping City No. 409 Automobile Factory
    Repaired 140 Vehicles Last Month
    Exceeding Plan by 50 Percent
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Ping City No. 409 Automobile Factory, by adopting a democratic management system, has stimulated the enthusiasm of its workers. Production in April exceeded the original plan in all areas. The repair section originally planned to repair 90 vehicles, but actually overhauled 116 vehicles and performed minor repairs on 24 vehicles, totaling 140 vehicles, exceeding the original plan by 50 percent. The truck assembly department originally planned to assemble one vehicle every six days per two-person team, with a plan to assemble 17 vehicles in April. As a result, they assembled one vehicle every four and a half days, assembling a total of 29 vehicles, exceeding the original plan by 12 vehicles. The parts manufacturing department manufactured a total of 7,591 important parts such as pistons and copper sleeves in April, compared to only 1,031 pieces in February and 3,581 pieces in March. The innovation department successfully trial-produced a "universal" carburetor in April, making a total of four. Automobile valve cores were also successfully trial-produced, and ten boxes have already been made.
    During the April production campaign, two factory-wide labor models, Cheng Jiaohua and Chen Shijie, emerged, along with 25 labor models from various units, such as Zhang Zhongye. For example, workers in the electrical department, in addition to normal repairs, also automatically searched for parts in scrap heaps and repaired 25 motors. Technician Ji Baozhen used Ford pistons to modify and install them in 1940 Studebaker cars.
    However, the factory still has some shortcomings: for example, tools are not cared for well enough, with two electric drill bits broken in April alone. There are still many people taking leave, and various parts are still being lost. At the beginning of May, workers in various units of the factory have successively put forward pledges to strive to overcome the above shortcomings, everyone striving to be a labor model, so as to further improve production.

    平市四○九汽车厂
    上月修车百四十辆
    超过计划百分之五十
    【本报讯】平市四○九汽车厂采用民主管理制度，发挥了职工积极性，四月份生产均超过原来计划。修理课原计划修汽车九十辆，结果大修一百十六辆，小修二十四辆，共一百四十辆，超过原计划百分之五十。辎车装配部门原计划每二人一组，六天装配一辆，四月份计划装配十七辆。结果四天半装配一辆，共装配了二十九辆，超过原计划十二辆。配制部门在四月份共制了重要零件活塞、铜套等七千五百九十一件，而今年二月仅制一千零三十一件，三月仅制三千五百八十一件。创造部门在四月份试制万国化油器成功，共做了四个。汽车气门心亦试制成功，并已制成十盒。
    在四月生产运动中，出现了全厂劳动模范程交华，陈世杰二人，各单位劳动模范张忠业等二十五名，如电工部工人除正常修理外，还自动在废料堆中找出零件，修制了二十五部马达。技工吉宝珍利用福特活塞改制装用四零年司徒贝克座车。
    但目前该厂还存在着若干缺点：譬如对工具爱护得不够好，四月份一个月电钻头就折了两只。请假的人还多，各种零件仍有遗失的现象。五月初，该厂各单位工人已纷纷提出保障，要努力克服上述缺点，人人争取做劳动模范，使生产更提高一步。        （鸣）
