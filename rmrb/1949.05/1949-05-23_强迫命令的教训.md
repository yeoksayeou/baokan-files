Lessons from Coercive Orders

　　In Niu Tuo Town, Gu'an, some cadres of the first district, in their eagerness to complete the sowing task, violated the principle of voluntarism and forced the masses to implement large-scale mutual aid. They erroneously announced to the masses: "All the carts and livestock in our village must be handed over to the Farmers' Association for management. Anyone who does not participate in the mutual aid organization will not be allowed to use them." Under duress, 56 people signed up and were temporarily organized into seven groups. The next day, the village cadres gathered the groups after breakfast and didn't combine them until noon before collectively going to the fields. During the digging of cotton pits for sowing, there were no regulations for recording work points, compensating for work, or clearing work, so all manpower and animal power were completely organized to implement a large-scale work stoppage, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some even deliberately wasted manpower. For example, when sowing for the family of a soldier, Liu Fenshan, some dug the cotton pits very deep and large, and one load of water could only fill four pits (when it could actually fill twenty pits), which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some said, "If he digs pits like that, we won't finish sowing the village until the Mid-Autumn Festival." In one day, these 56 people only sowed 7.6 mu of land, resulting in a significant reduction in labor efficiency.

　　After understanding the situation, the district cadre first explained the harm of coercive orders to the village cadres. Some village cadres said, "Our first district is different from other districts. We have more loafers in our district, and we can't do it without coercion." Later, they used the specific facts of mass dissatisfaction to educate the cadres, who then realized that mutual aid must be voluntary. After propaganda, deliberation, and cadres taking the lead, five mutual aid groups were freely formed, totaling 26 people. In one day, they sowed 9.2 mu of cotton and dug a well. As a result, the masses became very active and improved labor efficiency. The thinking of some backward village cadres also changed. For example, the village deputy said, "I used to think that the masses wouldn't do anything unless you pushed them, but today, 26 people did more work than 56 people yesterday!" This really gave me a lesson.

　　强迫命令的教训
    固安牛坨镇一牌干部为了急于完成点种任务，违反自愿原则，强迫群众实行大互助。向群众错误地宣布：“咱们村所有的大车和牲口都必须交农会管理起来，谁若不参加互助组织，就不让谁使用。”群众在不得已的情况下，就有五十六个人报了名，临时编为七个组。第二天村干部从早饭后就召集各组，直到正午才结合起来，集体下了地。在挖棉坑点种当中，也没有规定记工、补工、清工等办法，就把所有的人力和畜力完全组织起来实行大罢工，群众不满。甚至有个别的故意浪费人力，如给军属刘分山点种时，有的把棉坑挖的又深又大，一挑水只能浇满四个坑（实际能浇二十个坑），因而引起群众不满，有的说：“象他这么样挖坑，咱村点种到八月十五日也种不完。”这五十六个人一天的工夫，只点了七亩六分地，结果大大的降低了劳动效率。
    区干了解此情况后，首先对村干说明强迫命令的害处，有些村干部说：“我们一牌与别的牌不同，我们牌的二流子多，不强迫不行。”后来又以群众不满的具体事实教育干部，才认识了互助必须自愿，又经过宣传酝酿和干部带头，才自由结合了五个互助组，共二十六个人，一天时间即点种棉花九亩二分，挖井一眼。这样一来群众表现很积极，提高了劳动效率，个别落后的村干部，思想也获得转变，如村副说：“从前我认为群众不打着不拉屎，今天二十六个人比昨天五十六个人干的活还多呢！”这真给了我个教训。
