Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: The Taiyuan front-line reporter reports on the liberation of Taiyuan, saying: After the People's Liberation Army's repeated advice on the peaceful resolution of the Taiyuan issue was rejected by the Chiang-Yan bandit army, it launched an attack on Taiyuan city at 5:00 AM on April 20th. At that time, the enemy's defensive deployment was to use ten divisions as the first-line force, deployed in the outer positions, attempting to resist and retreat in stages, consuming the People's Liberation Army; then, in coordination with the second-line three divisions, to firmly defend the core area composed of key strongholds such as Xincheng, Wohu Mountain, Jianziwan, and Shuangta Temple; and to use two main divisions as mobile forces, ready to respond at any time; and to use the "Fuxiang District" (i.e., Taiyuan city) as a reserve position. After the offensive was launched, a dozen or so arrows of the People's Liberation Army simultaneously broke through the enemy's forward positions from all sides and inserted into the depth. First, they occupied the main stronghold of Xincheng (ten miles north of the city), broke through the enemy's strong defense lines of Yangjiabao and Nantun in the southwest of the city, occupied the southwestern fortress of Laojunying and the north and south Fen River bridges, cutting off the connection between the east and west of the Fen River. The various armies all appeared in the rear of the enemy's outer positions, and swept and attacked on both flanks, dividing the enemy into nine pieces. The enemy's outer positions immediately collapsed, and all six divisions were annihilated. On the one hand, our army took advantage of the victory to drive straight in, not giving the enemy any chance to breathe, so that it could not organize a second line of defense; on the other hand, it swept away the remnants left behind. By the afternoon of the 20th, the People's Liberation Army on the southern front had occupied Daxiaonanguan and Donggang Village south of Shouyi Gate, and the People's Liberation Army on the northern front had occupied the steelmaking enemy. At the same time, the enemies west of the Fen River were completely eliminated. At 18:00 on the same day, the People's Liberation Army on the eastern front also launched an attack, successively capturing the Jianziwan Fortress of the enemy's core area and Tangjiagou, Hangjiagou, Hongyingfang, Dadongguan, and Heitugang, surrounding one of the enemy's divisions and two regiments on all sides. The People's Liberation Army armies all approached the city, but the enemy still attempted to use Wohu Mountain and Shuangta Temple as supporting points to firmly defend the city walls. On the morning of the 22nd, the People's Liberation Army captured the above two points, capturing Cao Guozhong, commander of the enemy's 19th Army, and Liu Xiaozeng, commander of the 43rd Army, and eliminating the remnants of the enemy outside the city. At this point, twelve of the enemy's seventeen infantry divisions had been completely annihilated by us. However, more than 30,000 remaining enemies defending the city still refused to surrender, attempting to fight like trapped beasts. At 5:30 on the 24th, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack simultaneously from the southeast, northwest, and north, firing 1,300 cannons at the same time, bombarding the city walls and covering the infantry's charge to attack the city. At 6:10, the city was successfully ascended. At 7:30, the attacking troops entered the city from all twelve breakthrough points, dividing the enemy into countless small pieces and annihilating them one by one. At 10:00, the battle was completely over, and the bandits Sun Chu and Wang Jingguo were captured alive. The Taiyuan fortress area, composed of more than 2,000 steel and concrete bunkers as the backbone and countless field fortifications and defense objects connected to form a network of more than 30 miles, was completely conquered by our People's Liberation Army.

    太原解放经过
    千三百门大炮一齐开火攻城
    我军四面突破各个歼灭敌人
    【新华社北平二十九日电】太原前线记者报道解放太原经过说：人民解放军在和平解决太原问题的多次劝告遭受蒋阎匪军拒绝后，乃于四月二十日上午五时对太原城发起攻击。当时敌人的防御部署，是以十个师为第一线兵力，布置于外围阵地，企图节节抗退，消耗解放军；然后协同第二线的三个师固守以新城、卧虎山、剪子湾，双塔寺等要塞据点构成的核心区；另以两个主力师为机动兵力，准备随时策应；而以“复巷区”（即太原城）为预备阵地。攻势发起后，解放军十数个箭头，同时从四面突破敌前沿阵地，向纵深插入。首先占领城北主要据点新城（城北十里），突破城西南杨家堡、南屯敌强固防线，占领西南要塞老军营与南北两座汾河桥，隔断汾河东西敌人的连系。各路大军均出现于敌外围阵地的后方，并向两翼席卷和攻击，将敌人分割为九块，敌外围阵地即土崩瓦解，六个师全部就歼。我军一方面乘胜长驱直入，不给敌人以丝毫喘息机会，使它来不及组织第二道防线；另一方面扫荡遗留在后面的残敌。至二十日下午南线解放军已占领了大小南关与首义门以南的东岗村，北线我军占领炼钢敌，同时，将汾河以西之敌全部肃清。当日十八时，东线解放军亦发起攻击，连续攻占敌核心区的剪子湾要塞及唐家沟、行家沟、红营房、大东关、黑土港，将敌一个师另两个团四面包围。解放军各路大军都直逼城下，但敌仍企图以卧虎山与双塔寺两个要塞作支撑点，固守城垣。二十二日上午解放军攻克上述两点。生俘敌第十九军军长曹国忠及四十三军军长刘效曾，肃清城外残敌。至此，敌十七个步兵师中已有十二个为我全歼。但守城残敌三万余人，仍拒绝投降，妄图作困兽之斗。二十四日五时半。解放军于东南西北四面同时发起攻击，以一千三百门大炮，一齐开火，猛轰城垣，掩护步兵冲锋攻城。六时十分登城成功。七时半，攻城部队自十二个突破口全部入城，将敌分割为无数小块，各个歼灭。十时，全部结束战斗，生擒匪首孙楚、王靖国。敌人以二千余钢骨水泥碉、为骨干及无数野战工事和防御物所连接组成纵横三十余里的太原要塞地带，即为我人民解放军完全攻克。
