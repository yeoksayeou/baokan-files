　　To Prevent Major Floods
  　Rushing to Repair Dangerous Sections of the Yangtze River Embankment
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Nanjing Municipal Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee formed three embankment repair engineering teams on the 22nd and dispatched them to rush-repair dangerous sections of the Yangtze River embankments in Wangjiang, Yizheng, and other areas in the middle and lower reaches of the river. This section of the embankment had been breached last year and subsequently damaged extensively by Kuomintang bandit troops. If not repaired in time, it would be extremely dangerous when the major flood season arrives. To protect the lives and property of the people along the Yangtze River, the Nanjing Military Control Commission ordered all engineering teams to complete the embankment repair project before June 15th. The Political Department of the East China Military Region Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also issued a notice requiring the headquarters of each sub-district, each administrative office, and each county along this section of the embankment to send capable cadres to lead the people in assisting the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee's engineering teams in the rush repairs. The notice also called upon the field armies stationed in the area to assist in the rush repairs.

　　预防大汛
  　抢修长江险堤
    【新华社南京二十四日电】南京市长江水利委员会，在二十二日组成三个修堤工程队，出发抢修长江中、下游望江、仪征等地的险要江堤。该段江堤，曾于去年溃决，以后又遭受国民党匪军的破坏，损毁很多，如不及时修理，大汛到来，即非常危险。为保护长江沿岸人民的生命财产，南京市军管会命令各工程队必须在六月十五日以前完成修堤工程。中国人民解放军华东军区司令部政治部也发出通告，要求该段江堤沿岸各分区司令部、各专署、各县派出得力干部领导人民协助长江水利委员会工程队抢修，通告中并号召驻扎该地的野战军协助抢修。
