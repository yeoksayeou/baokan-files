　　Methods for Controlling Red Spider Mites
    Red spider mites are very small animals, almost invisible to the naked eye. They are oval-shaped and reddish-brown. Their life cycle can be divided into five stages: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The eggs are initially white but turn red after five or six days when they hatch into larvae. These mites reproduce very quickly, parasitizing the back of leaves and sucking their sap and chlorophyll. Therefore, affected wheat turns yellow, withers, and dies.
    Here are several control methods: (1) Based on the prevention experience in various regions, irrigating wheat fields where red spider mites occur is a very effective method.
    (2) Use flour paste to control them. Mix one catty of wheat flour with seventy catties of water. First, put the one catty of flour and ten catties of water in a pot and cook it over a fire into a thin slurry. Then add sixty catties of water, mix well, and use it after it cools. It is best to choose a sunny day for application. Approximately three hundred catties of water and a little over four catties of flour are needed per mu of land.
    (3) Spray with a mixture of one part of 3% DDT powder or 5% DDT powder and one part of sulfur powder.

　　红蜘蛛的防治法
    红蜘蛛是一种很小的动物，眼睛几乎看不见，椭圆形，土红色。他的一生可分为卵、幼虫、前期幼虫、后期幼虫和成虫五个时期。卵初生时是白色，后变成红色，经五六天变为幼虫。此虫繁殖力特别快，寄生在叶子背面，用口吸吮叶子的汗液和叶绿素，所以受害的麦子都变成黄色，枯干而死。
    几个防治办法：（一）根据各地区防治经验，在发生红蜘蛛的麦田，施行浇水，是一种最有效的办法。
    （二）用面糊水防治，用白面一斤、水七十斤，先把一斤面粉和十斤水放在锅里，用火煮成稀浆糊，然后再加六十斤水，使稀薄拌匀，冷后使用，使用时最好选择晴天。一亩田约要用三百斤水四斤多面。
    （三）用百分之三的滴滴涕粉或百分之五的滴滴涕粉末一份，加硫黄粉一份喷杀。
