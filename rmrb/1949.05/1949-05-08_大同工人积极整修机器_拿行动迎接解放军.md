[Chahar News] When the workers of Datong heard the news that Datong was about to be peacefully resolved, they were extremely excited. They immediately began enthusiastically repairing machines in preparation for resuming work. Railway workers at the Beiguan Station began cleaning rooms five days before the liberation (April 28th), clearing obstacles to traffic, repairing the water pumps at the water source, and renovating workshops and gatehouses. In just two or three days, they prepared everything needed for trains to enter the station, waiting for trains from Zhangjiakou and Fengzhen to arrive. Workers at the city's hand grenade factory, military telecommunications bureau, and Datong Telecommunications Bureau also welcomed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) with practical actions. Liang Zhijiang, a worker at the Telecommunications Bureau, took the lead in repairing the carrier wave machine. Zhao Xida, a worker, spent two days voluntarily repairing a generator. The workers at the Fuxing Daily printing factory rushed to print a large number of leaflets welcoming the PLA for various factories and schools in the days before and after the liberation. On the morning of April 29th, when our advance troops arrived at the station, they were warmly welcomed by workers, citizens, and students in Beiguan and the city. A propaganda officer from our unit, holding a special edition about the liberation of Nanjing, was immediately mobbed by the crowd before he could even distribute it.

On April 30th, the students of Datong formed a student welcome committee. Under the leadership of the committee, students went to the streets to scrub off reactionary slogans, post new slogans welcoming the PLA, and distribute leaflets. On May 2nd, before the PLA officially entered the city, workers, students, and citizens formed a long line to welcome them at the North Gate. When they heard that the PLA was entering the city from the East Gate, they immediately rushed to the east in a bustling crowd. At 1:00 PM, the PLA began to officially enter the city. As soon as the military music began to play outside the city, the welcoming crowd erupted. When the heroic and orderly ranks of the PLA appeared before the people, the applause, cheers, musical instrument sounds, slogan shouts, and the PLA's military music merged together, stirring the Datong city that had been silent for many years. The passage left for the troops was already very narrow. But the people in the back kept pushing forward. Many students stuck small flags on the soldiers' backpacks, and some citizens said, "When that faction (referring to the Kuomintang army) was here, how dare the common people even get close to them." When many model squads and platoons with hero flags passed by, thunderous applause erupted. Wherever the PLA went, slogans and applause followed. The welcoming people, not yet satisfied, still followed the troops in a surging tide. Many workers and students crowded around the PLA all the way to their campsite before reluctantly dispersing.

    大同工人积极整修机器
    拿行动迎接解放军
    【察哈尔讯】当大同的工人们听到大同将要和平解决的消息后，极为振奋，随即热烈整修机器，准备复工。北关车站铁路职工，在解放前五天（四月二十八日），就开始清理房间，扫除通车障碍，装修水源地的水泵，修装工作间、闸楼等工作，两三天的时间，就把火车进站时所需用的一切，准备得妥妥当当了，专等着张家口、丰镇的列车开来。城里手榴弹工厂、军用电讯局、大同电信局的职工，也以实际行动来欢迎解放军。电讯局工人梁之江带头修理载波机，工人赵锡达用两天时间自动装修好了一部发电机，复兴日报印刷厂的工友，在解放前后数天内，给各工厂、学校赶印了欢迎解放军的大批传单。二十九日上午，当我先头部队到达车站时，受到北关的工人、市民和城里学生热烈欢迎。我某部宣传员拿着南京解放的号外，不待分发，就被大伙一抢而光。
    大同的学生于四月三十日组成了学生欢迎委员会，在该会领导下，学生们分头到街上刷洗反动标语，张贴欢迎解放军的新标语和散发传单。五月二日解放军正式入城前，城里工人、学生、市民结成一条漫长的行列到北门去欢迎，当他们听到解放军从东门进城时，立刻熙熙攘攘赶往东去。下午一时解放军开始正式入城，军乐刚在城外奏响，欢迎的人群就沸腾起来了，当英武、整齐的解放军行列在人们面前出现时，欢迎者的掌声、欢呼声、乐器声、口号声和解放军的军乐声就溶合到一起，激荡了沉寂了多年的大同城，给部队留的通路已经是很窄很窄了。可是后边的人们还一个劲的向前挤，好些学生把小旗插在战士们的背包上，有的市民说：“那一派（指国民党军）在这的时候，老百姓那敢挨挨他们。”当许多插着英雄旗帜的模范班、排通过时，顿时如雷的掌声轰响了起来。解放军走到那里，口号声和鼓掌声就跟到那里。欢迎的人们尚未尽兴，还风卷云涌地尾随在部队的后面，许多工人和学生一直把解放军簇拥到宿营地，才恋恋不舍的散去。
