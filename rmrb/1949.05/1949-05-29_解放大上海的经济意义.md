The great city of Shanghai has been transferred from the clutches of imperialism and comprador-bureaucrat capitalists into the hands of the people. This marks the end of the fate of a major aggressive base where, for nearly a century, imperialism enslaved the Chinese people and made our country a colony. As everyone knows, the so-called commercial profits worth many tens of thousands of U.S. dollars that the imperialists plundered from China every year are the crystallization of the sweat, blood, and lives of the Chinese people. The imperialists brazenly opened many banks and factories in Shanghai, using their vast capital and superior technology to suffocate China's national industry. This resulted in the backwardness of Chinese industry and the suffering of the people. In recent years, due to the frantic aggression of U.S. imperialism, the all-round betrayal of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the collusion of the four major families in desperately plundering the people with the help of the U.S., Shanghai has become a general hub for strangling the Chinese people. Now, such a "Greater Shanghai" has been crushed by the iron fist of the people, and Mao Zedong's banner has been planted on the high-rise of the Broadway Mansions. From now on, it will become a people's industrial metropolis, and it will make its greatest contribution to the new democratic construction of all of China based on the principle of self-reliance.

　　解放大上海的经济意义
    沈志远
    大上海从帝国主义和买办官僚资产阶级的魔掌中转到人民手里来了。这样就结束了近百年来帝国主义奴化中国人民、使我们国家殖民地化的一个最大侵略基地的命运。人家知道，帝国主义者每年从中国掠夺去的值许多万万美元的所谓商业利润，都是中国老百姓的汗血和生命的结晶。帝国主义者在上海喧宾夺主的开设着很多银行和工厂，借其雄厚的资金和优良的技术，把中国的民族工业全窒息死了。这样就造成了中国产业的落后和人民生活的疾苦。近年来更由于美帝的疯狂侵略，蒋介石匪帮的全面卖国，以及四大家族的勾结美帝拼命搜括人民，上海就成为全面绞杀中国老百姓的总枢纽了。现在这样一个“大上海”已被人民的铁拳所摧毁，毛泽东的旗帜已经插在百老汇大厦的高楼上。从此，它将变成一个人民的工业大都市，对全中国新民主主义的建设，它将依据自力更生的原则，尽其最大的贡献。
