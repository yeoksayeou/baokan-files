(Jilu Yu Electricity) The Jilu Yu Daily recently published an editorial titled "Strengthen Organization and Leadership to Victoriously Complete the Wheat Harvest." The editorial first pointed out that this year's wheat harvest in our region is being carried out in a peaceful environment, which will provide many favorable conditions, and farmers everywhere feel extremely excited and encouraged. However, there are also certain difficulties, such as a small number of lurking special agents and saboteurs who will take the opportunity to undermine efforts. In addition, years of enemy looting and destruction have caused serious disasters in some areas, and there is a general lack of labor, livestock, and tools. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen organization and leadership and overcome difficulties in order to smoothly complete the wheat harvest. To this end, the editorial puts forward the following suggestions for local reference: (1) To solve the difficulties of labor and livestock, we must first mobilize women to participate in harvesting and threshing. Secondly, adhere to the principle of voluntary exchange at equal value, advocate and organize labor exchange and mutual assistance, as well as hiring short-term workers, and exchanging straw for cattle labor, etc., to regulate the shortage of labor and livestock. (2) Do a good job in the substitute harvesting work for martyrs' families, military families, and workers' families. In the leadership of substitute harvesting, on the one hand, designated personnel must be responsible to ensure a good harvest and oppose perfunctory work; but it must also be noted that substitute harvesting should not be carried out across the board, which would excessively increase the burden on the masses. (3) In order to prevent sabotage by bandits, special agents, and thieves, leading comrades at all levels must go deep into the leadership and organize the masses to protect the wheat and the threshing grounds. Pay attention to seed selection. (4) In areas where straw hats are braided, more common wheat seeds should be reserved to solve the problem of raw materials for braiding stems. (5) In accordance with the spirit of the agricultural tax regulations and the decision of the wheat levy meeting in this region, implement the policy of wheat levy burden, ensure the completion of the task, and strive for a fair and reasonable burden. (6) In new areas and areas where land reform is not thorough, the policy of "whoever sows, reaps" should be implemented to stabilize the mood for production.

　　冀鲁豫日报社论号召
  　加强领导完成麦收
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫日报顷以“加强组织领导胜利完成麦收”为题发表社论。社论首先指出本区今年麦收是在和平环境中进行的，这将给予以许多有利条件，各地农民为此感到极大的兴奋与鼓舞。但是也还有一定的困难，如少数潜藏的特务破坏分子，会乘隙破坏，加之敌人连年抢掠摧残，部分地区灾荒严重，劳畜力与工具普遍缺乏等。因此，必须加强组织领导，克服困难，以便顺利完成麦收。社论为此，特提出以下意见供各地参考：（一）解决劳力畜力困难，首先要发动妇女参加收割、打场等工作。其次坚持自愿等价原则，提倡和组织变工互助及雇觅短工，以草料换牛工等，以调剂劳畜力之不足。（二）作好烈、军、工属的代收工作，在代收领导中，一方面要指定专人负责，保证收好，反对潦草从事；但也须注意不应一律进行代收而过分加重群众负担。（三）为防止匪特偷盗分子的破坏，各级领导同志必须深入领导与组织群众进行护麦护场。注意选种工作。（四）在编草帽辫的地区，应多留笨麦种，以解决辫梗原料问题。（五）根据农业税则精神及本区麦征会议决定，贯彻执行麦征负担政策，保证任务完成，并力求负担公平合理。（六）在新区及土改不彻底地区，应执行谁种谁收的政策，以安定生产情绪。
