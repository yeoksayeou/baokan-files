　　General Nie Rongzhen
  　Calls for Unity Between Workers and Peasants
    General Nie Rongzhen pointed out that North China has gone through eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and more than two years of the People's Liberation War, and is now completely liberated. The Party, government, army, and people of North China have made great contributions. Regarding the people's contributions, General Nie Rongzhen first mentioned the peasants, saying: In North China, peasants enthusiastically joined the army, with millions of soldiers going to the front line. Secondly, they provided war support, also contributing greatly, and peasants contributed 20% to 30% of their income to the country. When talking about the contribution of industrial production to the war, he particularly pointed out the achievements of military industrial production. He said: The shells made by our military factory workers not only hit the enemy's positions and fortresses in North China, but also hit the enemy's positions and fortresses on the banks of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Our shells were supplied to all battlefields across the country, so everyone participated in every battlefield and every campaign. He pointed out that the people's military factories were developed bit by bit under extremely difficult circumstances; but today some factories need to be transformed to better suit the current needs. General Nie Rongzhen called on workers and peasants to unite well. He said that this is not just empty talk, but has a lot of practical content. Workers should do a good job in production and reduce product costs so that farmers can buy cheap goods, and they will be satisfied with the city and the workers. If rural production can meet the needs of the city, workers will also be satisfied with the countryside and the farmers, and they will unite well. Finally, he talked about the factory management committee and introduced how the highly centralized army promotes democracy and concentrates the opinions of soldiers. He said that in factories, especially when leaders and managers are not very familiar with their work, they should concentrate everyone's creativity. This democratic system should be fully implemented first in public factories.
    The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon, amidst thunderous applause from all the representatives and staff present.

　　聂荣臻将军
  　号召工农团结
    聂荣臻将军指出，华北经过了八年抗日战争，两年多的人民解放战争，现在已完全解放，华北的党政军民是贡献了很大的力量的。在人民的贡献上，聂荣臻将军首先提到了农民，他说：在华北，农民热烈参军，在百万战士开上前线，其次出战勤，也付出了很大的力量，并且，农民将自己收入的百分之二十至三十拿出贡献给国家。在谈到工业生产对战争的贡献时，特别指出了军工生产的成绩。他说：我们军工厂工人同志们所造的炮弹，不仅打到了华北敌人的阵地上、堡垒上，而且打到黄河边、长江边敌人的阵地上、堡垒上，我们的炮弹供给了全国各个战场，因此，大家也就是参加了每一个战场和每一个战役。他指出，人民的军工厂是在极艰难的环境下一点一点发展起来的；但今天有些工厂需要改造得更适合目前的需要。聂荣臻将军号召工农要很好团结。他说这不是一句空话，是有很多实际内容的，工人同志应把生产搞好，降低产品成本，使农民们能买到便宜的物品，就会对城市，对工人满意。农村的生产能满足城市的需要，工人对农村，对农民也会满意，就会团结好的。最后，他谈到工厂管理委员会，介绍了需要高度集中的军队是如何发扬民主，集中战士的意见的。他说在工厂，尤其是在领导管理人员还很不熟悉自己的业务的时候，更应集中大家的创造，首先在公营工厂即应全部实行这一民主制度。
    大会至午十二时，在到会全体代表、职工掌声雷动中散会。
