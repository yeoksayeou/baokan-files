Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 22nd: Elections were held in several Eastern and Western European countries this week. The Hungarian People's Independent Front won a great victory in the election. Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, said: The election results show the growth of the prestige and influence of the party leading the country—the Hungarian Working People's Party. However, "Everything we have accomplished is just the beginning, and the people's growing trust in us increases our sense of responsibility." In the election of local people's councils in Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front has also won. People's jurors are being elected in various parts of Romania. In Italy, in the municipal elections, the election results in several important areas show a significant increase in the votes for the People's Democratic Front, while the votes for the reactionary government group parties have plummeted. Following the county elections in April, the Labor Party suffered another defeat in this week's district elections in Britain, losing a net of 646 seats. The Labor Party's shameful defeat is the result of the Atlee-Bevin group's implementation of reactionary domestic and foreign policies.
    The Third Second United Nations General Assembly closed on the 18th after meeting for 46 days. Under the manipulation and control of the United States, this General Assembly passed a number of reactionary resolutions, and one of the main topics of this General Assembly, the Indonesian issue, was postponed to the September General Assembly for further discussion. Nevertheless, the activities of American and British imperialism at this General Assembly were not so satisfactory. The U.S.-backed proposal to allow Franco's Spain to "act freely" in establishing diplomatic relations and the Bevin-Sforza plan to deal with former Italian colonies, although passed by the Political and Security Committee, were rejected by the General Assembly.

　　东欧和西欧各国选举中
  　民主力量获得重大胜利
    这一周东欧和西欧的若干国家举行了选举。匈牙利人民独立阵线在选举中赢得巨大的胜利。劳动人民党总书记拉科西说：选举结果显示了领导国家的党——匈牙利劳动人民党的威信与影响的增长。但是，“我们所已完成的一切，还不过是刚刚开头，人民对我们与日俱增的信任加重了我们的责任心。”在保加利亚地方人民议会的选举中，祖国阵线亦已获胜，罗马尼亚各地正在选举人民陪审员。意大利在市镇选举中，若干重要地区的选举结果显示人民民主阵线的选票显著增加，反动的政府集团党派的选票则已惨跌。英国继四月郡选之后，在本周的区选中工党又遭失败，净失六百四十六席。工党的可耻的失败，乃是艾德礼、贝文集团实施反动的内政外交政策的结果。
    第三届第二次联合国大会在集会四十六天之后已于十八日闭幕。在美国的操纵与把持之下，本次大会通过了一些反动决议，本次大会主要议题之一的印尼问题被拖延至九月大会再行讨论。虽然如此，美英帝国主义在本次大会上的活动却并不那么称心如意。美国在背后主持可以与佛朗哥西班牙在建立外交关系时“自由行动”的建议以及处理前意属殖民地的贝文——史佛卓计划，虽经政治安全委员会通过，但却被大会否决了。　　　【新华社北平二十二日电】
