(JiluYu Electric Dispatch) The masses in Guo Lizhuang, Fifth District, Yunbei (newly established county, northern Yuncheng), Henan area of ​​our district, are overcoming the difficulties of livestock shortages by means of mutual aid in pulling plows. There are a total of one hundred households in the village. Like other villages in the vast Henan area, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel looting and destruction over the past two years, livestock and farm tools are extremely scarce. Currently, the village has only five head of livestock (and two others that cannot be used). The village has more than 800 mu of spring land alone. If they don't find a solution, the planting plan will be difficult to achieve on time, and the substitution work will be difficult to do well. The village cadres convened a meeting and decided to use the method of pulling the plow, dividing into three groups, each group with one plow, pulled by twelve or thirteen people. The chairman of the Farmers' Association took the lead and plowed more than eleven mu of land in one day. The thirteen mu of spring land belonging to two military families were plowed in one day. Under the influence of the village cadres taking the lead in pulling the plough, the masses were in high spirits, all feeling that this method was good, and that they could farm the land even without livestock. Everyone is prepared to continue helping each other so that all the spring land in the village can be sown on time.

    郭李庄人拉犁
    没牲口也种地
    【冀鲁豫电】本区河南地区郓北（新设县，郓城北部）五区郭李庄群众，以互助拉犁办法，克服牲畜缺乏的困难。该村共百户，和广大河南其他村庄一样，由于国民党反动派两年来的残酷抢掠、破坏，牲口、农具极感缺乏，现该村仅有五头牲口（另有两个不能使用），全村仅春地即有八百余亩，如不想办法，播种计划难以应时实现，代耕工作也难做好。村干部召集会议，当讨论出用拉犁办法，分成三个组，每组一张犁，十二、三个人拉，农会长亲自带头，一天即拉了十一亩多地，两家军属的十三亩春地，一天时间就犁完了。群众在村干亲自带头拉犁影响下，情绪很高，都觉这个办法好，没牲口也能种上地。大家准备继续互助下去，使全村春地都能按时播种。
