Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 13th: The May production emulation drive undertaken by workers in Shijiazhuang's publicly owned factories has achieved preliminary results in the past ten days. The Yumin Flour Mill No. 2 had a daily output of 500 bags before the competition, which increased to 777 bags by the 5th, and the quality also met standards. The average output of the Xinhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory for the four days from the 2nd to the 6th increased by 8% compared to the average output for the four days at the end of April. Railway Factory workers, after assembling the "Taiyuan" locomotive before May Day, are now rushing to assemble the "May Labor" locomotive. In the coking plant, thanks to the veteran kiln worker Sun Changming's application of years of experience in modifying the firebrick kiln equipment, the fire-adding working hours were reduced by one-half, and the coal consumption per kiln was also reduced from 5,200 kg to 3,560 kg. At the Yumin Chemical Factory, the machine worker Yang Daming invented a soap shaving machine, which increased the efficiency of shaving soap flakes threefold. The Northwest Printing Factory established a relatively scientific quality inspection system during the competition. Yumin Flour Mill No. 2 conscientiously implemented a system of merit and demerit checks. Most factories have established or improved factory management committees to further implement democratic management, and all major issues related to production are discussed by the committee.

  　展开五月大竞赛产量提高创造多
    【新华社石家庄十三日电】石家庄市各公营工厂职工所进行的五月生产竞赛，旬日来已获得初步成绩。裕民面粉第二厂竞赛前日产五百袋，至五日即增至七百七十七袋，质量亦合标准。新华染织厂二日至六日四天的平均产量较四月末四天的平均产量增加百分之八。铁路大厂工人于“五一”前，装出太原号机车后，现在赶装“五月劳动号”。炼焦厂由于老窑工孙长明运用多年经验，改造了缸砖窑装置，使加火工时节省了二分之一，每窑燃煤亦由五千二百公斤减至三千五百六十公斤。裕民化学厂，由于机器工人杨大明发明肥皂削片机，使削肥皂片的工作效率提高三倍。西北印刷厂在竞赛中建立了比较科学的质量检查制。裕民面粉二厂认真实行功过检查。大部分工厂为着进一步实行民主管理，均建立或健全了工厂管理委员会，一切有关生产的重大问题，均经该委员会讨论。
