    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Sydney - The Sydney Forum published an article on the 4th opposing the Pacific Pact. The newspaper pointed out that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in late April discussed the planned Pacific Pact. Although the official communique stated that the conference only discussed the future status of India and the relationship between India and the British King, the conference would not have been conducted so secretly if it had only discussed these issues. The newspaper stated that plans for the Pacific Pact are being drafted. There is no question that the Australian people will never agree to this plan by Wall Street, which aims to use the Australian people to confront the democratic movements in Asia.

    反对太平洋公约
    【新华社北平六日电】悉尼讯：悉尼论坛报四日著论反对太平洋公约。该报指出四月下旬的英联邦总理会议曾讨论过计划中的太平洋公约。仅管官方公报说，会议只是讨论印度未来地位问题及印度与英王关系问题，但会议如果仅仅讨论这些问题的话，它就不至于会如此秘密地进行。该报称，太平洋公约的计划是正在拟订中。毫无问题，澳大利亚人民决不会同意华尔街旨在利用澳大利亚人民来对抗亚洲民主运动的这种计划。
