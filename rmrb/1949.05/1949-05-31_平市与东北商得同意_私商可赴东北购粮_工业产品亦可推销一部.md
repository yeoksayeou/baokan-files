　　Ping City and Northeast Agree:
  　Private Merchants Can Go to Northeast to Purchase Grain
    Some Industrial Products Can Also Be Promoted
    [Our Newspaper] The investigation group jointly formed by public and private sectors in Beiping to investigate food grain and transportation conditions in the Northeast has returned to Beiping after achieving considerable success. To promote the exchange of goods between inside and outside the customs, the Beiping Municipal Trading Company, in conjunction with two private merchant representatives, formed an investigation group that went to the Northeast on the 19th of this month to investigate grain sources, transportation conditions, and promote some industrial products from Beiping. The group arrived in Shenyang on the 21st and completed its work and returned to Beiping on the 28th. According to its负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge), the investigation group contacted the Northeast Commercial Department, Dongxing Company, and other relevant departments after arriving in Shenyang. They agreed with the Beiping Trading Company's cooperation with private merchants to develop grain sources. Regarding transportation methods, it was believed that private merchants could currently use less-than-carload (LCL) shipments to transport grain into the customs. The Northeast trade departments also stated that Northeast timber and paper produced in Andong (Yanmo paper, striped glossy paper, and reed glossy paper, etc.) could also supply some to Beiping. Regarding the issue of promoting industrial products from Beiping in the Northeast, a result was also negotiated. Several dozen kinds of industrial product samples carried by the investigation group were all left behind. The Northeast trade departments believed that the striped cloth, mattress covers, bed sheets, and some rubber products produced in Beiping were quite excellent and could be sold in the Northeast. The two sides initially exchanged opinions on the production and required quantities of these goods to prepare for specific implementation.

    【本报讯】北平公私合组赴东北调查食粮及运输情况之调查小组，于获得相当成就后，现已返平。北平市贸易公司为交流关内外物资，曾联合私商代表二人，合组一个调查小组，于本月十九日前往东北调查粮源、运输情况及推销北平一部工业产品。该组于二十一日到沈阳，廿八日事毕返平。据其负责人谈此行经过称：调查组抵沈后曾与东北商业部，东兴公司等有关部门接洽，他们对于北平贸易公司协同私商开辟粮源表示同意。关于运输办法，认为私商目前可以采用按零担货物运输粮食入关。东北贸易部门并表示：东北之木材及安东所产之纸张、（片艳模造、条有光纸、苇料有光纸等）亦可供应北平一部。关于北平所产工业品在东北推销问题，亦商得结果。调查组所携之工业品样数十种全部留下，东北贸易部门认为北平所产之花条布、褥单、床单及一部橡胶制品相当精良，可以在东北销售，双方就此项货品之生产及需要数量初步交换意见，以作具体进行之准备。
