　　Introduction to Chinese History Tutorial

  　I. The Significance of Studying Chinese History
    The history of human society is the process of its own development. The most unique characteristic of human society lies in the fact that humans can engage in labor and production. Therefore, the history of human society should be the history of the development of laboring producers.
    History is a science, a science that seeks to discover the laws of development and change in the entirety of human society. In particular, it is a science that studies the laws by which laborers promote the development of human society. However, the history of all past societies, except for primitive conditions, is the history of the enslavement and struggle for liberation of laborers, the history of class struggle. Therefore, our study of past history now mainly involves the study of the science of the emergence, development, and decline of a certain class society; the study of the science of class struggle; and at the same time, the study of how to eliminate classes to achieve a classless society.
    Historical science is a powerful tool for fighting for national revolution and social revolution. We should know the true history of mankind, the history of the enslavement and struggle for liberation of laborers, and should know where we come from and where we are going. Because this can tenfold strengthen our confidence in the struggle and give us the knowledge of the conditions for the victory of this struggle.
    We often see that any nation, if it lacks detailed historical records, will weaken its national self-esteem and confidence in the struggle. Zhang Taiyan said:
    "I have often seen Indians say that they have no national history in the past, and now they want to collect it into a book, seeking miscellaneous history and short books as the basis, but they cannot get it, and they often regret it." ("Guo Gu Lun Heng," "Yuan Jing")
    Whether the facts said by the Indians are true or not is not known for the time being. However, Zhang Taiyan's deep sigh for the Indians' pain of not having a written history is meaningful. He also said:
    "If a country has a long history, it is difficult to perish. Since the Qin Dynasty, the invasion of the barbarians and the interruption of the royal way have been numerous; however, those who are @ do not dare to destroy the old chapters, and it is easy to reverse. If it is not possible to help, the anger is always seen in the actions, enough to wait for the future, so the current national character is not degraded, and the people know that they are more valuable than Rongdi. Which 'Spring and Autumn' is the outline? If Confucius does not publish 'Spring and Autumn'※, the predecessors go, they cannot speak to the descendants, and the descendants have no way to know the predecessors. If they are invaded, they will settle for the division of the public, and the poem says: 'It is better to die, others are stealing'. This can be used as a long-term potential for tears." (Ibid.)
    He also said:
    "The sky is full of sores, and they are all drowning together. The Manchus perished and rose again, and the Japanese exerted their thunderous power to help them. The Xia Dynasty is in danger, and I don't know where the bottom is! If I am a scholar, I will still abandon the classics and history and not learn, and forget the great leisure of the nation, then I will be ruined and become slaves!" (1935 "Lectures on Reading Classics are Beneficial and Harmless")
    He also said:
    "History is of great importance to the national foundation. Qin destroyed the six kingdoms and burned all the history of the six kingdoms; after the demise of Korea, the Japanese secretly hid their history books and did not allow Koreans to see them; in view of the current situation in China, people are unhappy to learn, and historical biographies are shelved. If there is a disaster in the sky and the invasion of foreign countries is suffered again, then it will not take 30 years of new national education. Han ancestors and Tang ancestors must have no one to know, and after a hundred years, the descendants of Yan and Huang will be able to be transformed into foreign races!" (1933, "The Relationship between Reading History and Cultural Revival")
    ※Since Confucius began to use chronicle examples in "Spring and Autumn," Chinese history has a verifiable era. Zhang Taiyan highly praised Confucius for this achievement. This is his brilliant view. Because history must describe the most important events and facts in the context of the correlation of the era, in order to give historical figures an accurate evaluation, otherwise it is not equal to novels and legends, but only becomes the abstract definition of social and economic forms and violates the materialist historical view. (Author's Note)
    Zhang Taiyan was a literary figure and historian in modern China who was proficient in old literature. He deeply embraced nationalism and patriotism, which he had learned from old history. However, he liked to use ancient characters in his writing, worshiped ancient prose, and opposed vernacular Chinese, sticking to the past and opposing the present. He was a stubborn and conservative person, and his national thought was also a narrow Han chauvinistic idea that regarded himself as an excellent nation. There is a fundamental difference between our proletarian national liberation and national self-determination thoughts; the meaning of his research on history is also very different from ours: he wants people not to forget the so-called "civil and martial arts" of the Han ancestors and Tang ancestors, and that he is a "conqueror" nation's "glorious" historical relics; our research on Chinese history is to discover the laws of Chinese social development, strengthen the people's confidence in the victory of the revolution, and absorb historical experience. Before the Xinhai Revolution (1911) in China, his anti-Manchu thought played some role in propagating the revolution, but when the Xinhai Revolution initially won in Wuchang, he vigorously advocated the fallacy that "the revolutionary army rises, the revolutionary party disappears," and was willing to stand on the same position as the feudal warlords and counter-revolutionaries to oppose Sun Yat-sen and oppose the revolution. In the era of the Great Revolution, he also stood on the side of counter-revolution. By the time of the "December 9th" Movement in 1935, on the one hand, he approved of the student anti-Japanese revolutionary movement, and on the other hand, he promoted Confucianism and reading classics for counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek and others. This is because he was a representative of the feudal scholar-bureaucrat class, with only national consciousness and patriotic thought, and no position of the progressive revolutionary class. This is what we should clearly point out, because our evaluation of historical figures must distinguish between his words and deeds, those that are in line with the interests of the people and those that are contrary to the interests of the people, point out his merits and demerits, and not blindly believe or obliterate everything. We should have a critical attitude towards accepting all historical heritage. I have quoted Zhang Taiyan's remarks above only because he said that human society must have detailed historical records, and future generations must know how their predecessors developed and struggled, so as not to forget the valuable experience of human development and not to cut off history. It is only in this sense that he is written here.
    Now we are in the final stage of capitalism - the era of imperialism, distressed by the fact that the laboring people of our ancient country of Shenzhou are sinking into the bitter sea of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, recognizing Marx's scientific socialism, loudly calling out, so that the sleeping lion suddenly wakes up and jumps into the torrent of the world revolution. Some revolutionaries, influenced by the revolutionary ideas of 18th-century France, do not recognize the authority of everything and what the past history considered sacred: all old religions, philosophies, worldviews and views on life, social and national systems, etc., must be subjected to merciless criticism; everything must be judged in the face of reason, and everything that cannot prove its rationality is declared eliminated. This attitude of suspicion and the spirit of revolution are very valuable. However, to regard all old social and national forms, all traditional concepts, as irrational, as old waste to be discarded, to think that all the world before the present was directed by some prejudices, and therefore all its past is only worthy of sighing and contempt, and its history is not worth considering. This not only obliterates the civilization created by the history of the development and evolution of the laboring people, cuts off history, and inevitably leads to utopian socialism, but also happens to leave a powerful weapon for the reactionary forces and fascists, enabling them to use special national psychology to deceive the people. Dimitrov, in his report "The Offensive of Fascism and the Tasks of the Communist International in the Struggle for the Unity of the Working Class Against Fascism" at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, said:
    The fascists distort the entire history of each nation in order to portray themselves as the inheritors of all the noble and heroic deeds in the history of this nation, and use all the disgraceful facts that hurt the national concept to oppose the enemies of fascism. Hundreds of books are published in Germany with the sole purpose of falsifying the history of the German nation in the spirit of fascism. The fledgling historians of the National Socialist Party desperately falsify German history, turning German history into this... It seems that due to some "historical law," there has been a line of development running through the past two thousand years, and as a result, a national "savior" has appeared on the historical stage, which is the "savior" of the Germanic nation, a native of Austria, the famous "corporal"! In these books, the greatest figures in the history of the German nation are portrayed as fascists, and the great peasant movements are portrayed as the direct ancestors of fascists.
    "Mussolini desperately used the heroic model of the national hero Garibaldi to earn political capital. The French fascists regarded the heroine Joan of Arc as their hero. American fascists used the tradition of the American War of Independence, the tradition of Washington and Lincoln, as an excuse. Bulgarian fascists used the national liberation movement of the 1970s and the reputation of its glorious national heroes - Levsky, Galacha, etc.
    "Some Communists believe that all these things have nothing to do with the cause of the working class, and would rather stand by and watch, but do not use the correct historical perspective, the true Marxist, Marxist-Leninist, Leninist-Stalinist spirit, to explain the history of their own nation in front of the working masses, but do not link the current struggle of the Communists with the revolutionary traditions of the nation's past; this is tantamount to voluntarily offering all the precious deeds in the history of the nation to the historical distorters of the fascists, allowing them to deceive the people."

　　中国历史教程绪论
    吴玉章
  　一　研究中国历史的意义
    人类社会的历史就是人类社会自己发展的过程。人类社会最特殊的特点，就在于人类能劳动生产。因此人类社会的历史，应该是劳动生产者发展的历史。
    历史是一种科学，它是要发现整个人类社会发展变化的规律的科学。尤其要研究劳动者推进人类社会发展的规律的科学。但是，一切过去社会的历史，除了原始的状态以外，都是劳动者被奴役和争取解放的历史，都是阶级斗争的历史。因此，现在我们研究过去的历史，主要地是研究一定阶级社会的产生、发展和衰落的科学；是研究阶级斗争的科学；同时要研究怎样消灭阶级以达到无阶级的社会的科学。
    历史科学是为民族革命和社会革命而斗争的有力工具。我们应该知道人类真正的历史，劳动者被奴役和争取解放的历史，应该知道我们从哪里来和往哪里去。因为，这能十倍地坚强我们奋斗的信心和给我们这种斗争胜利条件的知识。
    我们常常看见，凡一个民族，如果缺乏详实的历史记载，则会减弱民族的自尊心和奋斗的自信心。章太炎说：
    “余数见印度人言其旧无国史，今欲搜集为书，求杂史短书以为之质，亦不可得，语辄扼腕。”（“国故论衡”，“原经”）
    印度人所说事实是否确实，姑且不论。而章太炎深为印度人太息没有成文历史的痛苦，则是有意义的。他又说：
    “国之有史久远，则亡灭之难，自秦氏以迄今兹，四夷交侵，王道中绝者数矣；然＠者不敢毁弃旧章，反正又易，藉不获济，而愤心时时见于行事，足以待后，故今国性不堕，民自知贵于戎狄，非‘春秋’孰纲维是？孔子不布‘春秋’※，前人往，不能语后人，后人亦无以识前，乍被侵略，则相安于舆台之分，诗云：‘宛其死矣，他人是偷’。此可为流涕长潜者也。”（同上）
    他又说：
    “天方荐瘥，载胥及溺，满洲亡而复起，日人又出其雷霆万钧之力以济之，诸夏阽危，不知胡底！如我学人，犹废经史而不习，忘民族之大闲，则必沦胥以尽，终为奴虏而已矣！”（一九三五年“讲论读经有利而无弊”）
    他又说：
    “史之有关于国本者至大，秦灭六国，取六国之史悉焚之；朝鲜亡后，日人秘其史籍，不使韩人寓目；以今日中国情形观之，人不悦学，史传束阁，设天降丧乱，重罹外族入寇之祸，则不待新国教育三十年，汉祖，唐宗必已无人能知，而百年之后，炎黄裔胄，决可尽化为异族矣！”（一九三三年，“讲读史与文化复兴之关系”）
    ※自孔子作“春秋”开始用编年纪事的例子，中国历史才有可考的年代，章太炎极推崇孔子这个功绩，这是他的卓见。因为历史必须在年代的联系性中，叙述最重要的事变和事实，才能给历史人物以确切的评价，否则不等于小说传奇，也只成了社会、经济形态抽象的定义而违背唯物史观。（著者注）
    章太炎为中国近代精通旧文学的文学家、历史家，他深深抱着民族主义和爱国思想，就是他从旧历史中领会得来。但是他在文字上好用古字，崇拜古文，反对白话文，泥古非今，是一个顽固守旧的人，并且他的民族思想也是一种狭隘的自居优秀民族的大汉族主义思想，和我们无产阶级的民族解放，民族自决思想有根本上的区别；就是他研究历史的意义也和我们大有不同：他是要人们不要忘了汉祖唐宗的所谓“文事武功”，自己是一个“征服者”的民族的“光荣”史迹；我们研究中国历史则是要发现中国社会发展规律，加强人民革命胜利信心和吸取历史经验。在中国辛亥（一九一一年）革命以前，他的排满思想起了一些宣传革命的作用，但辛亥革命在武昌初步胜利时，他就大倡“革命军起，革命党消”的谬论，情愿与封建军阀反革命站在一个立场来反对孙中山，反对革命。在大革命时代，他也站在反革命方面，到一九三五年“一二·九”运动时代，他一方面赞成学生抗日革命运动，一方面却又为反革命蒋介石等尊孔读经作宣传。这因为他是封建士大夫阶级的代表，只有民族意识和爱国思想，没有前进的革命阶级的立场。这是我们应该明白指出的，因为我们对历史人物的评价，必须分别他的言论与行动，那些是与人民利益相合，那些是与人民利益相反，指出他的功罪，而不能盲目信从，或一概抹煞。我们接受一切历史的遗产都应该有批判的态度。我上面引章太炎的几段话，只是为了他说人类社会必须有详实的历史记载，后人必须知道前人如何发展与奋斗的事迹，才不至遗忘了人类发展的宝贵经验，才不至割断历史，只是在这一点意义上，才把他写在这上面。
    现在我们处在资本主义的最后阶段--帝国主义的时代，痛心于我神洲古国的劳动民众，沉沦于半殖民地半封建的苦海中，认识了马克思的科学的社会主义，大声疾呼，使酣睡的牡狮，猛然惊起，跳跃于世界大革命的潮流中。有些革命家，薰染了十八世纪法国的革命思想，不承认一切的权威和过去历史所认为神圣的东西：一切旧的宗教、哲学、世界观与人生观、社会与国家的制度等等，都要受到无情的批评；一切都要在理智面前裁决，凡是不能证实它的理性的东西，都被宣告消灭。这种怀疑的态度和革命的精神，是非常可贵的。但是，把一切旧的社会与国家形式，一切传统概念，都认为不合理性的，当作陈旧废物而抛弃，认为凡在现时以前的世界，都为一些偏见所指示，因而一切它的过去只值得叹息而轻蔑，它的历史不值得一顾。这样就不仅抹煞了劳动人民的发展进化历史所创造的文明，割断了历史，必然要走到空想的社会主义，而且恰好给反动势力和法西斯蒂留下一个有力的武器，使他们能够利用特殊的民族心理来欺骗民众。季米特洛夫在共产国际第七次代表大会上，报告“法西斯主义的进攻与共产国际为工人阶级反法西斯主义的统一而斗争的任务”说：
    法西斯蒂曲解每个民族的整个历史，以便把自己形容成为这个民族史上一切高尚英勇事迹的继承者，而对于一切有伤民族观念的耻辱事实都利用来反对法西斯主义的仇敌。在德国出版几百种书籍，其唯一的目的，就是按照法西斯主义的精神来假造德国民族的历史。初出茅庐的民族社会党的历史家拼命假造德国历史，把德国历史弄成这个样子……好象由于什么“历史的规律”，在两千年来，都有一条发展线索贯串着，结果就有一个民族“救主”出现于历史舞台，这就是日耳曼民族的“救星”，祖籍奥国人，有名的“下士”！在这些书籍里，把日耳曼民族史上最伟大的人物，描写为法西斯蒂，而把伟大的农民运动，描写为法西斯蒂的嫡祖。
    “墨索里尼拼命利用民族英雄加里波的英勇模范，来赚取政治资本。法国的法西斯蒂把女杰冉·达尔克奉为自己的英雄。美国法西斯蒂借口美国独立战争的传统，华盛顿、林肯的传统。保加利亚的法西斯蒂利用七十年代的民族解放运动，及其光荣的民族英雄--列夫斯基、加拉查等人的声誉。
    “有些共产党员认为所有这些事情都是与工人阶级的事业没有关系，宁愿袖手旁观，却不拿正确的历史眼光，真正马克思主义的、马克思列宁的、列宁斯大林的精神，来在劳动群众面前，说明他们本民族的历史，却不把共产党员目前的斗争与该民族过去的革命传统联系起来；这样就等于自愿地把民族史上的一切宝贵事迹，奉送给法西斯蒂的历史曲解家，让他们愚弄民众。”（“论统一战线”一五六--一五八页）
