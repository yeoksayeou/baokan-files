Is Peking Opera "Difficult to Reform"? – Discussion on Old Operas, Part 3
	Luo Heru

I. The Problem of Solidification

Has Peking Opera reached a "degree of solidification" that makes it "difficult to reform" (Qin Zhaoyang)? It's hard to say when solidification occurs, as there isn't a specific standard. My opinion is that, regardless of whether it has reached a state of solidification or not, it can be reformed. Just as water solidifies into ice, it can no longer flow. However, if you apply fire to it, doesn't the ice turn back into water? And if you heat it further, doesn't the water turn into vapor? If the forms of Peking Opera are said to be solidified, it should refer to things like: abstract opening and closing of doors, mounting and dismounting horses, climbing mountains and disembarking from boats, etc.; formulaic expressions in plays like "I failed to greet you from afar, please forgive me face to face!" and "The death penalty is waived, but the living punishment is unavoidable!"; costumes not distinguishing between spring, summer, autumn, and winter, or different dynasties; beards hanging on the upper lip, obscuring the mouth, etc. If these forms are deemed unsuitable, they can be burned away and transformed into water or vapor; some that are usable can be temporarily retained without change. For example, the opening and closing of doors can also be used in Yangko operas and in the song drama "The White-Haired Girl," so these can be temporarily retained. Mounting and dismounting horses, climbing mountains and disembarking from boats are unified with the opening and closing of doors; whether they need to be changed immediately can be considered. As for the formulaic dialogue, when it hinders the plot, it is not difficult to change; simply don't use it when writing the script. As for costumes, the long robes and gowns, and the blue shirts and ancient costumes all have water sleeves, which are convenient for singing and dancing. If changes are needed, they can be made. The opinion that it "only suits idealized upper-class figures in history" (Qin Zhaoyang) is worth discussing. Robe-and-belt operas are suitable for upper-class figures such as Liu Yong, Cao Cao, Zhou Yu, etc., and are the attire of the oppressing class. But the Zhezi and Laodouyi operas are different. Granted, there are Chen Gong in "Catching and Releasing Cao" and Mao Peng during his private visit in "Four Scholars," who wear Zhezi when escaping or making private visits, but besides these, Zhezi and Laodouyi can be considered the clothing of ordinary people. Such as Song Shijie, who runs a restaurant, Mo Cheng, who works as a servant, Lao Xue Bao, Song Jiang, who copies examination papers, Xiao En, who fishes, and Zhang Mou, who sells straw sandals at Qingfeng Pavilion – these are not upper-class figures. Song Shijie sued three high-ranking officials and possessed a rebellious spirit. Mo Zhicheng, the protagonist in "Searching the Cup," is a servant who dies in place of his master, which is a typical feudal trope and extremely undesirable. "Fishing and Killing the Family" is anti-feudal. "Qingfeng Pavilion" depicts Zhang Jibao becoming an official and disowning his adoptive parents due to class differences. So there are many examples that do not represent the forms of idealized upper-class figures, and there are things besides robe-and-belt operas. As for newly written scripts, they can be handled more freely. As long as we recognize that this genre is included in the literary and art policy and understand that it is a social need, we don't need to fear the degree of solidification, as we have the heat to melt it.

II. Steps for Reform

All old operas should be reformed. Peking Opera is indeed different from local operas, and it is more difficult to perform modern content than local operas. But to say in general that local operas should be reformed first, and then Peking Opera, or that the reform of local operas should be the main focus, is not very appropriate. If there is a sequence, it should be based on specific situations and concrete decisions to avoid problems. Subjectively prescribing which type of opera should be the main focus will separate us from the masses. For example, Taiyuan has Peking Opera, but its position is not as strong as Shanxi Bangzi. Whether it's theaters or audiences, the former is not as numerous as the latter. The same is true for the ratio of Peking Opera to Cantonese Opera in Guangzhou. In these cities, of course, the reform of local operas should be the main focus. But in large cities like Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Nanjing, the reform of Peking Opera should be the main focus. Because actors want to perform, and audiences want to watch operas, our policy will not prohibit them from performing and watching operas. If we don't prohibit them, are we just going to let them propagate feudal toxins? The solution to this contradiction is only to reform them. This is necessary and definite; we should encourage comrades who are working in this field to strive hard.

Various local operas and Peking Opera should be reformed according to specific situations, concrete environments, and priorities, but all should be done and none should be missed. Local opera troupes can engage in local operas, and Peking Opera groups can engage in the reform of Peking Opera. They should focus on Peking Opera, but also refer to and study local operas, just as local opera work groups should focus on their local operas. Proceeding according to specific circumstances and work units should be the method for today's theater workers to reform operas.

According to Comrade Zhang Menggeng's work report titled "How to Reform Old Operas," published in the People's Daily on May 11, they have recently rehearsed some newly written Peking Operas and premiered them in Shijiazhuang, which has already achieved considerable results. Furthermore, the alumni theater troupe and other groups have performed newly written Peking Operas such as "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "Nine Pieces of Clothing," which have also achieved considerable results. These facts show that Peking Opera is not impossible to reform, and it is not extremely difficult. In addition to their own efforts, everyone should help write more scripts so that actors in these large cities have operas to perform and audiences have operas to watch, and they can receive education from watching operas. We must work hard, but don't rush. We can make a multi-year plan to complete the task of reform.

III. The Issue of Writing Historical Dramas

The statement that the Peking Opera form "is only suitable for expressing old historical subjects" (here I understand "old" as "past") is basically correct now. We must break through this old form, and this old form will inevitably be broken through, and has already begun to be broken through. Currently, the Peking Opera form is suitable for writing historical dramas but not very suitable for writing about modern real life. From the perspective of division of labor, this is not harmful and is in line with science. Let film, drama, and other groups take on the task of reflecting modern life. Since we have this form that can express historical subjects, we should use it, transform it, and make it go from toxic to non-toxic, from useless to useful. We can use more historical subjects to write historical dramas. This is not "because the Peking Opera form is not suitable for expressing the new people's life, so the call to write more historical dramas is also issued at the same time."

History is a vast and profound treasure trove of past social life and class struggle. Its content is sufficient for us to learn from, and its materials are sufficient for us to reflect upon. Now that we have overthrown feudalism and established a new democratic society, we should overturn the operas that glorify emperors and landlords, foolish loyalty and filial piety, operas that say emperors and landlords should oppress the people, operas that say the suffering of the common people is their fate, and operas that advocate that all people should obey emperors and landlords. We should reverse the verdicts and change them into operas that criticize and mock emperors and landlords, expose their crimes of oppressing the people, explain that the masses' disasters are caused by the violence and exploitation of the oppressors, not determined by fate, and should be overthrown and defeated. We should transform the operas that have served feudalism for many years into operas that serve the people. Among old operas, Peking Opera should take on this task first, because it is particularly suitable for expressing past historical subjects.

　　平剧“难以改造”吗？　旧剧讨论之三
    罗合如
    一、凝固化问题
    平剧是否到了“凝固化的程度”而“难以改造”（秦兆阳）？凝固化很难说，没有一定的标准。我的意见是，不管它到了凝固化的程度与否，是可以改造的。象水凝固而成冰，它便不能流了。可是，用火去烧它一下，冰不又变成了水吗？再烧一下，水不又变成了气吗？平剧的形式如果说是凝固的话，应该是指的这些：抽象的开门关门，上马下马，登山下船等等；“未及远迎，当面恕罪！”，“死罪已免，活罪难饶！”的戏八股等等；服装不分春夏秋冬，不分朝代等等；胡髭挂在嘴的上唇，看不见口等等………。这些形式如果觉得不适合的话，是可以用火来烧它一下的，可以成水成气；有些可以用的，还是可以暂时留下而不改。如开门关门，咱们在秧歌剧里面也用得上，在白毛女的歌剧中也在用着，这可以暂不改它。上马下马，登山下船，是与关门开门统一的，是否目前须改，可以考虑。戏八股的台词，到了起着阻碍的作用，需要改时，并不难改的，写剧本时不用它就行。服装，长袍大挂、青衫古装，都有水袖，便于歌舞。需要改的话可以改。说到“只合于历史上偶像化了的上层人物”（秦兆阳）这是值得商量的意见。袍带戏适用于上层人物如刘佣、曹操、周瑜等，是压迫阶级的衣冠形式。褶子与老斗衣等戏则不然，固然有捉放曹的陈宫，四进士私访时的毛朋，他们这一类的在逃跑时，在私访时的官儿们穿上褶子，但除此之外，褶子与老斗衣等要算是一般老百姓的穿着。如开饭店的宋士杰，当仆人的莫成，老薛宝，抄写墨卷的宋江，打鱼的萧恩，青风亭卖草鞋的张某等，这些并不是上层人物。宋士杰控告了三员大官，是有反抗精神的。搜杯中的主角莫之成他是个仆人，代替主人死，是封建的一个典型，极不好。打鱼杀家是反封建。青风亭是写张季宝作了官，因为阶级的差别，就不认其养身父母了。如此等等不是代表偶像化了的上层人物的形式也不少，并非除袍带戏外，无有别的。至于新写的剧本，更可以自由处理。咱们只要认定文艺政策上有这一门，认识这是社会的需要，不怕它凝固到什么程度，是有热力来溶解它的。
    二、改造的步骤
    一切旧戏都是应当改造的。平剧诚然有别于地方戏，如演现代的内容是比地方戏要来得困难一些。但笼统地说先改造地方戏，然后再改造平剧，或说以改造地方戏为主，都是不大适合的。假若有先后的话，也应当按具体的情形，作具体的决定才不出毛病。主观地规定以什么戏为主，便会脱离群众。比方说太原有平剧，但其地位不如山西梆子，戏院也罢，观众也罢，前者都不如后者之多。广州的平剧粤剧之比亦如是。在这些城市中当然要以改造地方戏为主。若北平、若天津、若武汉、若上海、若南京等大城市，那就要以改造平戏为主。因为演员要演戏，观众要看戏，咱们的政策是不会下令去禁止他们演戏和看戏的，不禁止难道就让它宣传封建毒素吗？这个矛盾的解决就只有去改造他。这是必要的，是肯定的；应当鼓励做这一门工作的同志去努力。
    各种地方戏、平剧，都应按着具体情形，具体环境，分别轻重地进行工作，但是都应做，不可缺一。地方戏的剧团可以搞地方戏，搞平剧的团体可以从事平剧的改造，它应以平剧为主，但也得参考研究地方戏，正如地方戏的工作团体，应以搞它的地方戏为主。按具体情形，按工作单位去搞，应该是今日戏剧工作者从事改造戏剧的办法。
    据张梦庚同志以“如何改革旧剧”为题，在五月十一日人民日报上发表的工作汇报，他们近来几个月排好了一些新写的平剧在石家庄试演，已经收到了相当的效果；再有校友剧团及其他团体演出“桃花扇”，“九件衣”等新写的平剧，也收到了相当的效果；这些事实说明了平剧不是不能改造，而且不是那末极端困难的。除他们自己努力以外，大家帮助多写些剧本，使这些大城市的演员有戏演，观众有戏看，从看戏里面受到教育。要努力，但不要着急。可以作个几年的计划来完成改造的任务。
    三、写历史剧问题
    平剧形式“只适合表现旧的历史题材”（这里“旧的”我是当作“过去的”了解），这句话在现在来说基本上是对的。咱们要突破这旧形式，这旧形式也必然将被突破，并且已经开始被突破。目前，平剧形式适合于写历史剧，但不很适合于写现代的现实生活，在分工的观点上去看是没有什么坏处的，是合乎科学的。反映现代生活的工作多让电影、话剧等团体去担任。既然有了这能表现历史题材的形式，咱们就应该利用它，改造它，使它从有毒到无毒，从无用到有用。可以多用历史的题材来写历史剧。这并不是“由于平剧形式不适合于表现新的人民生活，所以就又同时发出了多写历史剧的呼声”。
    历史是过去社会生活的、阶级斗争的、宽大深厚的宝藏。它的内容够咱们学习的，它的材料够咱们反映的。如今打垮了封建，建立了新民主主义社会，咱们应将歌颂帝王地主、愚忠愚孝的戏，说帝王地主应该压迫人民的戏，说老百姓的受苦受难是命该如此的戏，主张万民要服从帝王地主的戏，都翻过身来，翻过案来，改为批评与嘲笑帝王和地主的戏，暴露其压迫人民的罪恶，说明群众的灾难是由压迫者的暴力、剥削所致，不是命运所定，应当推翻它、打倒它等等的戏。使多年为封建服务的戏，一变而为人民服务的戏。旧戏中，平剧首先要担任这一任务，因为它特别适合于表现过去的历史题材。
