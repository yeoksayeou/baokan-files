　　【News from Central Hebei】Since the liberation of Baoding, the Third District has organized a cotton trading market, providing farmers in the surrounding villages with a fair trading place and eliminating the unlimited exploitation by cotton shops in the past. In order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and the reasonable exchange between agricultural and industrial products, and to maintain a certain profit for cotton growers and transporters, the state-owned Dasheng Store has been vigorously purchasing cotton. At the beginning, only a few hundred catties (of seed cotton) were traded daily. Since Dasheng's purchase, the market volume has gradually increased. Farmers from villages dozens of miles around the city, especially those in the cotton-producing areas of Mancheng, have come to the market to sell. Now the volume has increased to 5,000 to 10,000 catties (of seed cotton). Dasheng Store purchases an average of more than 75% of the total volume, and the rest is left for ginning and production. In 40 days, a total of 172,955 catties of seed cotton were purchased. Most of the farmers who sold cotton exchanged it for salt, foreign cloth, farm tools, and fertilizers; especially fertilizers, most of which were bought by farmers who sold seed cotton. In order to supply the needs of farmers and further promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, Dasheng Store has established a new store in the city in addition to the Yusheng branch in Xiguan and the Jiansheng branch in Nanguan, selling foreign cloth, kerosene, flour, etc. At the beginning, because farmers knew less about it, sales were not high. Now, more and more people are going to the store to buy, especially those from Mancheng, Tang, Wan, and Quyang counties in the west. This reduces the intermediate exploitation by merchants. At the same time, the two branches of Jiansheng and Yusheng also sell a large number of goods. In more than a month, a total of 4,262.5 bolts of foreign cloth, 452,398 catties of salt, 7,463 catties of kerosene, 388 bags of flour, and 1,144,961 catties of big coal were sold. Dasheng Store has grasped reasonable exchange in purchasing cotton and selling industrial products, and tried its best to solve the difficulties of the villagers in buying and selling. At the same time, it has educated and appropriately dealt with speculators who adulterate and moisten the goods, which has won the support of the villagers and improved the understanding of the store by farmers and the general public. At present, the general farmers' feedback is very good. This not only promotes the smooth flow of goods between urban and rural areas, but also establishes prestige among the farmers.

　　促进城乡物资交流免除中间剥削
  　保定组织棉花交易市场
    【冀中讯】保定解放以来，三区组织了一个棉花交易市场，使四乡农民有了一个公平交易的场所，免去了以往花店对农民的无限制剥削。国营大生商店为促使城乡物资交流及农工产品间的合理交换，保持种棉与运棉者的一定利润，进行大力收购，开始时，每日仅成交几百斤（籽棉），经大生收购以来，市场上量逐渐增加，围城数十里的村庄，特别是满城一带产棉区的农民，都赶到这市场上来卖，现在上量已经增加到五千至一万斤（籽棉），大生商店平均收购总量的百分之七十五以上，其余留给轧花生产，在四十天内，共收购籽棉十七万二千九百五十五斤。卖棉的农民，大部换回食盐、洋布、农具及肥料等；特别是肥料，大部都是卖籽棉的农民买去。大生商店，为供给农民需要，进一步促使城乡物品交流，除西关的裕生、南关的建生分店外，又在城内设立了一个门市部，出售洋布、煤油、面粉等。开始因农民知道的较少，销货不多，现在到门市部购买者逐渐增多，特别是路西满城、唐、完及曲阳等县者为多，这样减少了商人的中间剥削；同时建生、裕生两个分店，也大量出售。一个多月的统计，共出售洋布四千二百六十二匹半，食盐四十五万二千三百九十八斤，煤油七千四百六十三斤，面粉三百八十八袋，大煤一百一十四万四千九百六十一斤。大生商店在购棉、出售工业品上，是掌握了合理的交换，尽量解决乡民在买卖上的困难，同时对掺假施潮的投机商贩，进行了教育和适当的处理，得到乡民拥护，提高了农民和一般市民，对商店的认识。现一般农民反映均甚良好，这样不但促进了城乡间物资的畅流，而且在农民中树立了威信。
