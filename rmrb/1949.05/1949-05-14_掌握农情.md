    Grasp Agricultural Conditions
    Production has reached a critical juncture. The agricultural season is not to be missed. Party and government workers in all areas must pay attention to grasping the seasonality and precisely calculate the time when leading planting, allowing no delay for even a moment. "When the Little Full [solar term] flowers, don't go home." There are only seven days left until the Little Full. Cotton planting work must be carried out with a concentrated effort. There will be difficulties, but they must be resolutely overcome to ensure the realization of the planting plan.
    Leading agricultural production must pay close attention to grasping agricultural conditions. Taking only the weather as an example: Many agencies know too late and not specifically enough about the weather changes, the degree of rain, drought, dryness, and humidity in their subordinate areas. Recently, there has been a drought. To what extent is the drought? Is it a drought in most areas or a drought in a small number of areas? There is no definite answer. Also, when it rains, to what extent does it rain, and what area does it cover? There is no precise statistic. Last year's experience proved that if any agency or staff member cannot correctly grasp the changes in the weather, then he will inevitably be detached from the masses in the leadership of agricultural production and unable to put forward various specific measures to help the masses produce.
    Some areas also lack experience in leading production (especially new areas), and therefore often neglect to grasp the seasonality. The Taihang experience tells us that when leading agricultural production, we must promptly put forward various slogans according to seasonal changes, organize forces to concentrate on completing a task. Many of our areas only made a plan before spring plowing, and then conveyed it, and that was it. Facts have proved that this leadership method can only make the plan fail, because the agricultural plan must be constantly revised and supplemented according to changes in agricultural conditions, and should not remain unchanged.
    Time is pressing, requiring the departments in charge of production in various places to closely grasp agricultural conditions like fighting a war, combine the specific requirements of the masses, do more investigation, research, analysis, and synthesis work, discover problems, raise problems, and immediately use convenient conditions (such as telephones) to understand the situation and direct the work, unite the people on the production front to overcome difficulties, and prevent the predetermined plan from falling through.

### 掌握农情

    掌握农情
    生产已到紧急关头，农时不可误，各地党政工作者在领导播种时必须注意掌握季节性，精确计算时间，不容许有一时一刻的延误。“小满花，不回家”，现在离小满只有七天，植棉工作必须突击进行，困难是会有的，但必须坚决战胜，保证播种计划的实现。
    领导农业生产必须十分注意掌握农业情况，仅以天时一项来说：许多机关对于所属地区天时变化，雨旱干湿程度都知道得太迟太不具体，最近天旱了，旱到什么程度？是大部地区旱，还是小部地区旱？都没有一个确切的答案，又如下雨了，雨落到何等程度，占多大地区？也没有一个精确的统计，去年经验证明，任何一个机关或工作人员如果不能正确掌握天时的变化，那么，他在农业生产的领导上就不可避免地脱离了群众，无法提出各种具体办法帮助群众生产。
    也有些地区缺乏领导生产的经验（特别是新区），因而常常忽略了掌握季节性。太行经验告诉我们，领导农业生产时必须根据季节变化及时提出各种不同口号，组织力量集中突击完成一个任务，我们有不少地区只是在春耕前作了一个计划，然后传达了一下便完了，事实证明，这种领导方法只能使计划落空，因为农业计划必须不断地依据农情变化来修正补充，而不应一成不变。
    时间紧迫，要求各地领导生产的部门象作战一样地紧密掌握农业情况，结合群众具体要求，多作调查研究分析综合工作，发现问题，提出问题，要立即利用便利条件（如电话），来了解情况指挥工作，在生产战线上团结人民战胜困难，勿使预定计划落空。
