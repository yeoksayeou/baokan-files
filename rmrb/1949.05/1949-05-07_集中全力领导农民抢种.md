Concentrate All Efforts on Leading Farmers to Rush Planting

During the current short planting season, areas without rainfall must overcome all difficulties, launch drought resistance and rush planting, and resolutely complete the planting plan. This is an urgent combat mission entrusted to us rural workers by the Party, requiring Party committees at all levels to organize all forces in a combat posture to complete it.

What will we rely on to overcome the drought and complete the planting plan? From the report on Gocheng's examination of leadership and rectification of discipline in today's newspaper, we can learn two important lessons. The facts in Gocheng teach us to further recognize the importance of strengthening discipline. The facts prove that although the county party committee carried out many mobilizations and made specific arrangements for the planting plan, some cadres lacked organization and discipline, and did not resolutely go to the masses to carry out specific organizational work according to the instructions of the party committee, and abandoned the leadership of production, which put the planting plan on the verge of bankruptcy. Completing the planting plan is a difficult task, and it must have strong leadership. Whoever takes a derelict attitude on this point is committing a principled error. The Gocheng County Party Committee's serious attitude towards this phenomenon is correct. The county party committee mobilized all cadres with a spirit of self-criticism to oppose this unorganized and undisciplined mistake, enlightened the cadres' consciousness, and organized all forces to lead the rush planting, which is worth learning.

Secondly, it is a very necessary measure for the Gocheng County Party Committee to immediately organize the strength of the entire county and devote itself to planting and rush planting work on the basis of rectifying organizational discipline and improving the ideological awareness of cadres. That is to say, we must first give sufficient attention to this year's planting in terms of leadership. The victorious situation requires us to make achievements in both industrial and agricultural production at the same time. Although the current lack of rain has increased some difficulties for us in leading the planting, as long as we organize all forces and go all out, the conditions for overcoming difficulties exist. We must oppose the practice of bowing and being helpless in the face of difficulties. We once had the strength to overcome the severe drought of 1943 under the enemy's layers of blockade. Today's situation is completely different from the past, the favorable conditions are much more than in the past, and the people's level of awareness has also been unprecedentedly improved. As long as we are good at organizing and developing all forces, we can confidently overcome all difficulties.

### 集中全力领导农民抢种

　　集中全力领导农民抢种
    在目前很短的播种期间内，未落雨地区必须克服一切困难，展开抗旱抢种，坚决完成种植计划。这是党赋予我们农村工作者的紧急战斗任务，要求各地党委必须以战斗的姿态组织全部力量去完成。
    我们将依靠什么去战胜旱灾完成种植计划呢？从今天本报所载藁城检查领导整顿纪律的报导中，可以记取两点重要的教训。藁城的事实教训我们进一步认识了加强纪律性的重要，事实证明该县委虽进行了多次的动员，具体的布置了种植计划，但因为某些干部缺乏组织性纪律性，没有依照党委的指示坚决到群众中去进行具体的组织工作，而放弃了生产的领导，这样就使种植计划濒于破产危险。完成种植计划是一件繁难的工作，必须有坚强的领导，谁在这一点上采取玩忽职守，就是犯了原则错误。藁城县委以严肃的态度对待了此种现象是正确的。县委以自我批评的精神动员起全体干部去反对了这种无组织无纪律的错误，启发了干部的自觉性，组织了全部力量去领导抢种是值得学习的。
    其次是藁城县委在整顿组织纪律提高干部思想觉悟的基础上，立即组织全县力量，投入播种抢种工作是十分必要的措施，这就是说，我们对于今年播种，必须首先从领导上给予足够的重视，胜利的形势要求我们在工农业生产上同时做出成绩。目前天不落雨虽然增加了我们领导播种的若干困难，但只要组织所有力量，全力以赴，战胜困难的条件是存在的。我们要反对那种在困难面前低头、束手的作法。我们曾经有力量在敌人层层封锁的情况下战胜过一九四三年的严重旱荒，今天的情况和过去完全不同了，便利的条件比过去多了，人民的觉悟程度也空前提高了。只要善于组织与发挥一切力量，我们就可能有把握地去战胜一切困难。
