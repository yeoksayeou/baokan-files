Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 11th—Reports from various sources: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed a motion on the 7th that violates the UN General Assembly's 1946 resolution. This motion, under the instigation of the United States, was proposed by Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, and demands that all member states can "act freely" in handling their diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain. When the motion was put to a vote, 16 countries opposed it, and 16 countries abstained. After the motion was passed under the manipulation of the United States, the Polish representative proposed a motion demanding that the General Assembly reaffirm the UN General Assembly's 1946 resolution on Franco's Spain, which condemned the Franco regime, prohibited the Franco regime from joining any international organization established by or related to the United Nations, and demanded that all member states withdraw diplomatic envoys from Madrid as a protest against the Franco regime. The Polish representative's proposal was rejected by the majority controlled by the US and Britain. Furthermore, the general debate in the Political and Security Committee on the issue of former Italian colonies in Africa has ended, and the committee passed a resolution on the 9th to establish a subcommittee to review the various proposals that have been put forward regarding the handling of former Italian colonies.
