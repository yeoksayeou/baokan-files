    Recover Stolen Electricity to Develop Industry
    Tangshan Electric Power Company Uncovers 110,000 Kilowatt-Hours of Stolen Electricity
    [Our Newspaper] In order to supply more electricity to industrial production, the Tangshan Branch of the North China Electric Power Company launched an investigation into electricity theft, achieving great results. The branch company suffers monthly losses of about 400,000 to 500,000 kilowatt-hours due to electricity theft, equivalent to 250,000 catties of millet, which is equal to the entire monthly expenditure of the branch company's employees, or the electricity consumption of the 2,000-plus workers of the Huaxin Textile Factory for one and a half months. During the Kuomintang's rule, although there were organizations for investigating electricity theft, the collusion between investigators and electricity thieves under bureaucratic enterprise management became an open secret. After liberation, the policy of democratic enterprise management was implemented, and some advanced elements among the employees, seeing the rapid development of industrial production and the urgent need for electricity, proposed to recover losses from electricity theft. The military control representative accepted their suggestion and immediately established a democratic Electricity Theft Investigation Committee based on the old investigation organization, with activists as the backbone, divided into four groups: investigation, handling, survey, and technical research. The committee began work on the 19th of last month, and by the 9th of this month, in 20 days, it had already uncovered 153 households stealing electricity and more than 100 pieces of electricity theft equipment, which have now been dealt with. 143 households have been recovered electricity fees, with a total of 116,656 kilowatt-hours of electricity stolen, equivalent to 1,620,525 yuan. The amount of electricity stolen is equivalent to the total electricity consumption of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. Compared with the 202 households uncovered throughout last year, that is to say, 20 days of work is equal to 10 months before liberation. Among the electricity theft households, workshops using electricity were the most prevalent. The household with the most electricity theft (such as Xingye Oil Mill, accounting for more than a quarter of the total) attempted to bribe investigators but was refused. Later, they used the excuse of the government developing industry to deny their actions, but were sternly refuted by the investigators, and finally paid the electricity fees that they owed. In order to make electricity theft investigation a mass movement and encourage company employees to be more actively involved in in-depth investigations, it is reported that the company will formulate reward and punishment measures to reward those who report electricity theft, so as to send more electricity to industrial production.

    把被窃取的电力收回来发展工业
    唐山电力公司查获窃电十一万度
    【本报讯】为更多的送电给工业生产，华北电业公司唐山分公司展开对窃电现象的稽查运动，获得很大成绩。该分公司每月所受窃电损失约达四、五十万度之多，合小米二十五万斤，等于分公司员工全月的开支，或一个半月二千余人的华新纺织厂的用电量。在国民党统治时期，虽设有稽查窃电的组织，但在企业官僚化的管理下，稽查人员与窃电者的统通作弊已成公开秘密。解放后实行了企业管理民主化的方针，职工中一些先进分子看到工业生产迅速发展与迫切需要电力的情况，纷纷提出挽回窃电损失的意见。军管代表接受了他们的建议，立即在旧的稽查组织基础上成立了以积极分子为骨干的、民主的稽查窃电委员会，下分设稽查、处理、调查、技术研究四个小组。该委员会于上月十九日开始工作，至本月九日止，二十天中已经查出窃电户一百五十三家，窃电器材百余件，现已处理完毕。追回电费者有一百四十三家，窃电达十一万六千六百五十六度，合洋一百六十二万零五百二十五元，其窃电量相当于平津沿线铁路用电的总数。与去年全年所查出的二百零二户相比，就是说，二十天的工作，等于解放前的十个月。窃电户中，尤以使用电力的作坊为甚。窃电最多的户（如兴业油房，一家即占总数的四分之一强）曾欲贿赂稽查人员，遭到拒绝。后又以政府发展工业为借口来抵赖，经稽查人员严正驳斥，终将应出电费补上。为使稽查窃电成为群众性的运动，鼓励公司员工更积极的深入稽查，闻该公司将制定奖惩办法，奖励举发窃电者，以便把更多的电力送到工业生产上去。
