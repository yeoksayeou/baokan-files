　　The Moscow subway is a construction of which the Soviet capital is proud. Every piece of equipment in the subway is a true work of art. The stations are built according to the designs of the Soviet Union's first-rate architects. They are brightly lit, well-ventilated, and beautifully decorated with murals, statues, reliefs, and marquetry. The surfaces are covered with dazzling colored marble, giving people no feeling of being underground.
    The first Moscow subway line began operations on May 15, 1935. Its branches were 11.4 kilometers long, leading to the central area of Moscow and larger parks, theaters, and stadiums. In the three years that followed, the length of the subway network increased to 26.5 kilometers.
    During the war against Germany, the construction of the subway did not stop. During this period, the third line was completed, and the total length of the subway increased by 50 percent.
    Currently, the Moscow subway is 40 kilometers long and has 29 stations. In addition, the fourth line, which is 19.3 kilometers long, is under construction.
    The number of passengers carried by the Moscow subway is among the highest records in the world. A train arrives every one and a half or two minutes. In the first five years after the subway started operating, it carried a total of one billion passengers; in the next five years, it carried 1.9 billion. In 1946, the subway carried an average of 1.7 million passengers per day, and on some days it carried as many as 2 million.
    Many of the people who are now subway train drivers, station masters, and depot directors were formerly workers in the subway. Tatyana Fyodorova was a cement worker at a station in 1933, and is now an engineer and a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, as well as an alternate member of the council of the International Women's Federation. She still works in the subway.
    In order to commend the Moscow subway for its exemplary passenger transport work and successful use of new technologies, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded the Moscow subway the Order of Lenin on September 6, 1947.

　　莫斯科的地下铁道
    莫斯科的地下铁道，是苏联首都引为骄傲的建设。地下铁道的每一样设备，都是真正的艺术品。车站是按照苏联第一流建筑学家的设计而建造的，灯光明亮，通风良好，优美地装饰着壁画、雕像、浮雕和剪嵌细工，表面被以鲜艳夺目的彩色大理石，令人毫无置身地下的感觉。
    莫斯科的第一条地下铁道，于一九三五年五月十五日开始通车，其各支线共长十一点四公里，通往莫斯科中心区及较大的公园、剧院和运动场等地。此后三年期间，地下铁道网的长度已增加为二十六点五公里。
    对德战争期间，地下铁道的建造并没有停止：这一时期，第三条线完工了；地下铁道的总长度已增加百分之五十。
    现在，莫斯科的地下铁道共长四十公里，有车站二十九个。此外，长达十九点三公里的第四条线正在建造中。
    莫斯科的地下铁道所载运的乘客人数，是在全世界的最高纪录之列的。每一分半钟或两分钟，便有一列火车到站。在地下铁道开始通车后的头五年，乘客人数共为十亿；在此后的五年，则为十九亿。一九四六年，地下铁道平均每日载客一百七十万人，有些日子则载客达二百万人之多。
    现在做地下铁道火车司机、车站站长和停车场主任的许多人，从前都是地下铁道里的工人。塔吉亚娜·夫约多若娃，一九三三年时当一车站的水泥工人，现在则已成为工程师，并且是苏联最高苏维埃的代表，国际妇联理事会的候补理事。她现在仍然在地下铁道里工作。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团为了嘉奖莫斯科地下铁道的模范的客运工作及成功的使用新技术，特于一九四七年九月六日授予莫斯科地下铁道以列宁勋章。
