    II. Methods of Studying Chinese History (Continued Six)
    Looking at the revolutionary history of our Chinese Communist Party over the past fifteen years, every time the material life of society has developed to a new political situation, our Party has put forward new tasks. In December 1935, our Party pointed out the characteristics of the situation, saying:
    "The current political situation has undergone a fundamental change, marking a new period in the history of the Chinese revolution. This is manifested in the transformation of China into a colony by Japanese imperialism, the preparation of the Chinese revolution to enter a national great revolution, and the eve of revolution and war in the world." The task put forward by the Party:
    "Is to mobilize, unite, and organize all revolutionary forces of the entire Chinese nation to oppose the current main enemy—Japanese imperialism and the traitorous leader Chiang Kai-shek."
    This instruction of the national united front against Japan and against traitors suited the needs of social development at that time. Therefore, it was able to mobilize the broad masses of the people throughout the country, who enthusiastically demanded the realization of the Chinese Communist Party's slogan of "Stop the civil war and unite against foreign aggression." However, Chiang Kai-shek was still unwilling to resist Japan and instead continued to carry out the anti-communist and anti-people civil war, personally going to Xi'an to force Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to attack the Red Army of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Communist Party (that is, the current People's Liberation Army). Out of righteous indignation, Zhang and Yang arrested Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an on December 12, 1936, which is the famous Xi'an Incident. In order to unite the whole country to resist Japan, the Chinese Communist Party suggested to Zhang and Yang that as long as Chiang Kai-shek was willing to jointly resist Japan and implement the conditions put forward, he would be released to strengthen the anti-Japanese forces. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to express his willingness to cease the war, jointly resist Japan, and agree to implement the conditions put forward, which began the "July 7th" War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people carried out a difficult and heroic eight-year anti-Japanese national revolutionary war, causing Japan to surrender unconditionally, and the Chinese people won a glorious victory.
    However, in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, there were various dangers. The first was the danger of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek being anti-communist and surrendering. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the dangers at that time in June 1939, saying:
    "The characteristics of the current situation lie in the fact that the possibility of the Kuomintang's surrender has become the greatest danger, and its anti-communist activities are the steps to prepare for surrender. The Kuomintang's surrender may have existed from the beginning of the War of Resistance, not suddenly occurring today; but becoming the greatest danger of the current situation is a phenomenon in the current political situation. The Kuomintang's anti-communism also existed from the establishment of the united front, not suddenly occurring today; but taking anti-communism as a direct step towards surrender is the current reality."
    Comrade Mao Zedong timely pointed out the current tasks. In his reply to the reporter of Xinhua Daily, he said:
    "There are two futures for China: one is the future of persisting in resistance, persisting in unity, and persisting in progress, which is the future of rejuvenation. The other is the future of compromise, division, and retrogression, which is the future of national subjugation.
    In the new international environment, under the conditions that Japan is more difficult and our country will never compromise, the stage of our country's strategic retreat has ended, and the stage of strategic stalemate has arrived. The so-called stage of strategic stalemate is the stage of preparing for a counter-offensive.
    However, the frontal stalemate and the enemy's rear stalemate are inversely proportional. The possibility of frontal stalemate increases, and the possibility of enemy's rear stalemate decreases. Therefore, the large-scale military 'mopping up' carried out by the enemy in the occupied areas (mainly in North China) since the fall of Wuhan will not only continue in the future, but will also be intensified. Moreover, because the enemy's main policies are 'political offensive of using Chinese to control Chinese' and 'economic aggression of using war to support war,' and Britain's Eastern policy is to convene the Far East Munich, this aggravates the great danger of inducing China to surrender and creating China's division. As for the comparison between our country's national strength and the enemy, there is still a big difference. To prepare for the strength to implement a counter-offensive, it is impossible without national unity and hard struggle.
    Therefore, our country's task of resisting Japan is still a very serious task, and we must not be careless in the slightest.
    Therefore, there is no doubt that China must not give up the current opportunity, must not make the wrong idea, but should adopt a firm and correct political stance.
    That is: First, adhere to the stance of resisting Japan and oppose any compromise movement. Whether it is the open Wang Jingwei or the hidden Wang Jingwei, they should be resolutely打击. Whether it is the enemy's inducement or Britain's inducement, it should be resolutely rejected. China must not participate in the Eastern Munich.
    Second, adhere to the stance of unity and oppose any divisive movement. Whether it comes from the enemy, from foreign countries, or from domestic surrender factions, we should be fully vigilant. Any internal friction that is not conducive to the War of Resistance must be stopped with a solemn attitude.
    Third, adhere to the stance of progress and oppose any retrograde movement. Whether it is in military, political, financial, economic, party affairs, cultural education, or mass movements, all thoughts, systems, and methods that are not conducive to the War of Resistance must be reconsidered and effectively improved in order to benefit the War of Resistance and comfort the eager hopes of the people of the whole country.
    If this can be done, China will be able to prepare well for the strength of the counter-offensive.
    From now on, the whole country should take "preparing for the counter-offensive" as the general task of the War of Resistance."
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, preventing Chiang Kai-shek from daring to surrender and enabling China to turn to the counter-offensive.
    In 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong published On New Democracy. He said:
    "It is very clear that since the nature of Chinese society at present is that of a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society, it determines that the Chinese revolution must be divided into two steps. The first step is to change this colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal social form and turn it into an independent democratic society. The second step is to develop the revolution forward and establish a socialist society. The current revolution in China is taking the first step." This famous epoch-making thesis clearly stated the future of the Chinese revolution, the direction of Chinese social development, and the purpose of the Chinese revolution, giving people a clear answer ideologically and theoretically. It is an unprecedented great work.
    In 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong also published On the Coalition Government, detailing the general line for resisting Japan and building the country. The Double Tenth Agreement, the Armistice Agreement, the Political Consultative Conference, etc. after Japan's surrender all put forward new tasks when a new environment arrived.
    All the above put forward new tasks under the new situation, making it a new ideology and theory to mobilize the masses and organize the masses. These new tasks are produced by the development of the material life of society. They develop and change with the development and changes of the situation, and their ideological theories also continue to develop forward. Especially in the recent three years, the development of the situation has been faster and faster, and the proposal of new tasks has been faster and faster. Whenever there is a critical juncture in a new situation, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly and clearly points out new tasks, fully demonstrating his firm principles and necessary flexibility.
    In July 1946, the Kuomintang reactionaries, supported by American imperialism, tore up the Armistice Agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a counter-revolutionary national-scale war in China. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party, rose up to resist this counter-revolutionary war and held a great people's liberation war. After a year, the basic characteristic of the military situation was that the People's Liberation Army turned from defense to offense, and the Kuomintang's reactionary army turned from offense to defense. At the same time, in the Kuomintang's reactionary ruling area, the people could not bear the oppression and rose up to resist, opening up a second front. On May 30, 1947, an authoritative person of the CCP concluded on the current situation:
    "The development of the Chinese incident is faster than people expected. On the one hand, the victory of the People's Liberation Army, on the other hand, the advancement of the people's struggle in the Chiang-controlled area, both are very fast. In order to realize a peaceful, democratic, and independent new China, the Chinese people should prepare all necessary conditions." (Standard Edition of "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," North China Xinhua Bookstore Edition, page 4)
    On October 10, 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Resolution on the Promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China," calling for the development and implementation of the national land reform movement to complete the basic tasks of the Chinese revolution. This is the urgent demand of the peasants, who account for more than 80% of the rural population in China, that is, more than 360 million people. This mobilization call made the peasants raise their heads, overthrowing the feudal system in the liberated areas, breaking the shackles of production relations. The peasants became active, enthusiastically producing and joining the army, making the People's Liberation Army stronger and invincible. (To be continued)

    二、研究中国历史的方法（续六）
    从我们中国共产党最近十五年的革命历史来看，每当社会底物质生活发展到了一个新的政治形势时，我党就提出新的任务。一九三五年十二月我党即指出时局的特点说：
    “目前政治形势已经起了一个基本上的变化，在中国革命史上划分了一个新时期，这表现在日本帝国主义变中国为殖民地，中国革命准备进入全国性的大革命，在世界是革命与战争的前夜。”党提出的任务：
    “是在发动、团结与组织全中国全民族一切革命力量，去反对当前主要的敌人--日本帝国主义与卖国贼头子蒋介石。”
    这一反日反卖国贼的民族统一战线的指示，适合于当时社会发展的需要，因此就能发动全国广大民众，他们热烈要求实现中国共产党“停止内战，一致对外。”的口号。但蒋介石仍不愿抗日，反而继续进行反共反人民的内战，亲自到西安逼迫张学良、杨虎城进攻陕北共产党的红军（即现在的人民解放军）。张杨出于义愤，于一九三六年十二月十二日在西安把蒋介石逮捕起来，这就是有名的西安变十二事变。中国共产党为了团结全国一致抗日，就向张杨建议，只要蒋介石愿意共同抗日，实行所提出的条件，就释放他以加强抗日力量。蒋介石被迫表示愿意停战、共同抗日，并应允实行所提条件，这才开始了一九三七年“七七”的抗日战争。中国共产党和中国人民，进行了艰苦的英勇的八年抗日民族革命战争，使日本无条件投降，中国人民获得了光荣的胜利。
    但是，在八年抗日战争中，不是没有各种危险的，首先就是国民党蒋介石反共投降的危险。因此，毛泽东同志一九三九年六月指出当时的危险说：
    “目前形势的特点在于：国民党投降的可能已经成为最大的危险，而其反共活动则是准备投降的步骤。国民党投降可能是从抗战开始就存在的，不是今天突然发生的；但成为时局的最大危险，则是目前政局中的现象。国民党反共也是从统一战线建立时就存在的，不是今天突然发生的；但把反共作为直接投降的步骤，则是目前的实际。”
    毛泽东同志及时地指出当前的任务。他在答复新华日报记者的谈话中说：
    “中国的前途有两个：一个是坚持抗战、坚持团结、坚持进步的前途，这就是复兴的前途。一个是实行妥协、实行分裂、实行倒退的前途，这就是亡国的前途。
    在新的国际环境中，在日本更加困难与我国绝不妥协的条件下，我国的战略退却阶段便已完结，而战略相持阶段便已到来。所谓战略相持阶段，即是准备反攻的阶段。
    但是，正面相持与敌后相持是成反比例的，正面相持的可能增多，敌后相持的可能就要减少。所以，从武汉失守后开始的敌人在沦陷区（主要是在华北）举行的大规模军事“扫荡”，今后不但还会继续，而且还会加紧起来。更因敌人的主要政策是“以华制华的政治进攻”与“以战养战的经济侵略”，英国的东方政策是召开远东慕尼黑，这就加重了引诱中国投降与造成中国分裂的极大危险性。至于我国国力与敌人对比，还是相差很远，要准备实行反攻的力量，非全国一致，艰苦奋斗，是不可能的。
    因此，我国抗战的任务还是一个非常严重的任务，千万不要丝毫大意。
    因此，毫无疑义，中国万万不可放弃现在的时机，万万不可打错主意，而应该采取坚定正确的政治立场。
    这就是：第一，坚持抗战立场，反对任何的妥协运动。不论是公开的汪精卫和暗藏的汪精卫，都应该给以坚决的打击。不论是敌人的引诱和英国的引诱，都应该给以坚决的拒绝，中国决不能参加东方慕尼黑。
    第二，坚持团结立场，反对任何的分裂运动。也不论是从敌人方面来的，外国方面来的，国内投降派方面来的，都应该充分的警戒。任何不利于抗战的内部磨擦，必须用严正态度加以制止。
    第三，坚持进步立场，反对任何的倒退运动。不论是军事方面的、政治方面的、财政经济方面的、党务方面的、文化教育方面的与民众运动方面的，一切不利于抗战的思想、制度与办法，都要来一个重新考虑与切实改进，以利抗战，以慰全国喁喁之望。
    果能如此，中国就能好好的准备反攻力量。
    从现时起，全国应以“准备反攻”为抗战的总任务。”
    中国共产党和中国人民实行了毛泽东同志这个指示，使国民党蒋介石不敢投降，使中国转到反攻。
    一九四○年毛泽东同志发表新民主主义论，他说：
    “很清楚的，中国现时社会的性质，既然是殖民地半殖民地半封建的性质，它就决定了中国革命必须分为两个步骤。第一步，改变这个殖民地半殖民地半封建的社会形态，使之变成一个独立的民主主义的社会。第二步，使革命向前发展，建立一个社会主义的社会。中国现时的革命，是在做第一步。”这一有名的划时代的论文，把中国革命的前途，中国社会发展的方向，中国革命的目的，说得清清楚楚，使人从思想上、从理论上、得到一个明确的解答，是一部空前伟大的著作。
    一九四五年毛泽东同志又发表论联合政府，详细说明了抗日建国的总路线。日本投降后的双十协定、停战协定、政治协商会议等等都是在新环境到来，就提出新任务。
    以上这些都是在新形势下提出新任务，使它变成新的思想和理论，以动员民众、组织民众。这些新任务是由社会底物质生活之发展而产生的，是随时局的发展和变化，而发展和变化，其思想理论亦随之不断向前发展。尤其在最近三年来，时局的发展愈快，新任务的提出也愈快。每当一个新形势的紧要关头，毛泽东同志就很正确地、很明白地指出新的任务，充分表现出他的坚定的原则性和必需的灵活性。
    一九四六年七月，为美国帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派，撕毁了停战协定，政协决议，在中国发动反革命的全国规模的战争，中国人民和人民解放军则在共产党领导之下，起来反抗这种反革命战争，举行了伟大的人民解放战争。经过一年后，军事情况的基本特点就是人民解放军由防御转入进攻，国民党的反动军队则由进攻转入防御。同时国民党反动统治区域，人民不堪压榨，纷纷起来反抗，开辟了第二条战线。一九四七年五月三十日，中共权威人士评目前时局的结论说：
    “中国事变的发展，比人们预料的要快些。一方面是人民解放军的胜利，一方面是蒋管区人民斗争的前进，其速度都是很快的。为了实现一个和平的、民主的、独立的新中国，中国人民应当准备一切必要条件。”（“目前形势和我们的任务”标准本，华北新华书局版四页）
    一九四七年十月十日，中共中央发表“关于公布中国土地法大纲的决议”，号召展开及贯彻全国的土地改革运动，完成中国革命的基本任务。这是中国占乡村人口百分之八十以上的农民即三万万六千万以上的人的迫切要求，这一动员的号召，使农民抬起头来，在解放区推翻了封建制度，打破了生产关系的枷锁，农民就活跃起来，踊跃生产和参军，使解放军壮大而所向无敌。（未完）
