Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 16th: British Briefs: The newly formed executive committee of the British National Union of Mineworkers has three communists, including Horner, the General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, as well as Wayne, elected from Derbyshire, Pearson and Moffat from Scotland, and Davis from South Wales. The latter three are re-elected executive committee members. According to some political reporters, more than 100 Labour Party members abstained from the vote on the North Atlantic Treaty in the House of Commons on May 12. The Daily Express political reporter stated that 25 percent of Labour Party members abstained from voting.

The British Foreign Office announced on the 13th that Britain and Israel have agreed to upgrade their respective ministers to ambassadors. The statement also said that this decision does not change the fact that Britain recognizes its relationship with Israel in fact but not in law.
