　　Chairman Dong Biwu
　　Reports on North China Construction Work
    Chairman Dong Biwu, on behalf of the government, reported on the government's work in restoring and developing production, culture, education, health, and political construction. Regarding the restoration and development of production, he pointed out that in addition to supporting the vigorous development of state-owned factories, private factories are also being supported. He used several specific examples to illustrate the efforts made by the government. For example, the Kailuan Coal Mine originally belonged to imperialism, but today, for our long-term interests, the government is helping them with production, providing them with loans, and finding sales channels for them. As for the Qixin Cement Factory, the government has also ordered their goods to help them with production. In rural areas, due to the drought this year, the government is vigorously leading drought prevention and preparation for famine, and rushing to plant cotton. In terms of health work, the government is training doctors and preparing to launch a rural health campaign. It is also preparing to restore the schools of the past in the future. On the issue of political construction, Chairman Dong pointed out that we had taken a detour in the past, and we will carry it out with considerable strength in the future. Chairman Dong finally suggested that everyone should offer more opinions to the government and care about the government so that the government's work can be done well.

　　董必武主席
  　报告华北建设工作
    董必武主席代表政府，报告政府恢复发展生产、文教、卫生、建政等工作。在恢复发展生产上，他指出除扶持公营工厂大力发展之外，在私营工厂方面也是扶持的。他从几个具体例子上来说明政府所作的努力。如开滦煤矿本来是帝国主义的，但今天为了我们长远的利益，今天政府帮助它们生产，贷给它款，给它找销路。如启新洋灰厂，政府也订购了他们的货，帮助他们生产。在农村，因今年天旱，政府大力领导防旱备荒，抢种棉花。在卫生工作方面，政府训练医生，准备开展农村的卫生运动。并准备今后要恢复起过去的学校。在建政这个问题上，董主席指出，过去曾走过一段弯路，今后要以相当的力量来进行。董主席最后提议，要大家多多向政府提意见，关心政府，好把政府的工作做好。
