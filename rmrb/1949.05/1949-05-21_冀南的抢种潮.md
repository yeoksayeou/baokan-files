    The Rush to Plant in Southern Hebei
    Cadres in Government Offices
    [Jinan Electric] Since the emergency mobilization order for rushing to plant in Southern Hebei on May 14th, Party, government, and military organizations in various places have been actively participating in planting work. Over 300 people from the military region's veterans' school, despite their disabilities, went to the fields to help with the rush planting. Zhao Yunxiang, who is blind in both eyes, insisted on carrying water, saying, "You are all working so hard, let me carry water. Just lead me." Those with disabilities who could not carry water dug holes and sowed seeds. Students from the Third Branch of the District Party Committee Party School did not rest on Sundays, and mobilized baskets, shovels, spoons, etc., to help military families plant cotton and to help orphans and widows plant peanuts. Seventy staff members from the Xinhua Bookstore squeezed out a day from their busy work schedule to help the masses of Fangjiaying plant more than 20 mu of cotton. The direct organs of the Second District Committee dispatched 407 people to Xiajin and Enxian to assist in planting. Currently, cadres throughout the region are striving to lead the masses to complete the planting plan 100%.
    Teachers and Students
    [Jinan News] The Southern Hebei Administrative Office issued an emergency notice on the 3rd, ordering all schools above elementary school to suspend classes to help the masses with planting. Teachers and students from the Construction College, Agricultural and Forestry School, various middle schools, normal schools, and elementary schools have all joined the rush to plant. Ten female students from the Prefectural Women's Normal School helped 20 military families and poor orphans and widows in Sanlizhuang, Qiqu District, Linqing, by carrying water, watering, and planting. The director of the village women's federation was moved and said, "The female students are here to help us plant cotton. If we women don't get involved, what are we?" Li Pu, a student from Linqing Municipal Normal School, insisted on using large buckets to carry water. Sun Jingyi plans to strive to join the Party in this rush planting campaign. Many students' shoulders were rubbed raw, and their hands were blistered, but they still worked hard. They happily sang, "The troops on the front lines are winning battles, we are working hard to fight drought..." Teachers and students from the Southern Hebei Agricultural and Forestry School, stationed in Linqing, planted 648 mu of cotton in five days. They also used their meal times to repeatedly propagate [Communist ideology] to the masses, dispelling their ideological concerns. Three hundred and twenty teachers and students from Nangong Middle School helped the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers and poor people without labor in Dongguan East Street and Yudai Street in the city. Zhang Zibao, a teacher at the school, carried eight loads of water in one breath from a well three li away. They completed a day's scheduled task in half a day.
    Militia
    [Jinan News] Nearly a thousand militiamen in Handan County actively participated in the crash planting with a fighting spirit. After the County Party Committee arranged a ten-day crash planting task on the 25th of last month, each district convened a militia mobilization meeting, calling on the militia to lead the masses in planting. Zhou Xuezhang, the leader of the Xifuren militia class, said, "We must use the same energy we used to fight the enemy in this planting, and we must plant more and faster than the masses." All the militiamen in Nanlutun competed to participate in planting mutual aid teams, and carried guns to the fields at night to protect the waterwheels. Under their leadership, the four districts of the county planted 719,000 mu of cotton in ten days, exceeding the original planting plan by more than half.

　　冀南的抢种潮
    机关干部
    【冀南电】五月十四日，冀南抢种紧急动员令后各地党政军机关纷纷投入点种巨流。军区荣军学校三百余人，带着残疾，下地帮助抢种。赵云祥是个双眼瞎子，也争着要担水，他说：“你们干的怪累的，让我来担吧，只要你们领着我就行。”有残疾不能担水的便刨坑、撒种。区党委党校第三分支学员，星期不休息，分头动员了筐、锨、勺等帮助军属种棉花，帮助孤寡点种花生。新华书店七十名职工于紧张生产中，挤出一天帮助方家营群众点棉二十余亩。二地委直属机关抽出四百零七人，到夏津恩县助种。现全区干部正为领导群众百分之百的完成种植计划而奋斗。
    教师学生
    【冀南讯】冀南行署于三日紧急通知各完小以上各级学校停课帮助群众点种。建设学院、农林学校、各地中学、师范、完小等校全体师生，纷纷卷入点种热潮。专署女师的十个学生帮助临清七区三里庄二十户军属及贫苦孤寡挑水、浇水点种，该村妇联会主任被感动说的：“人家女学生都来给咱点棉花，咱们妇女再不下手那算啥？”临清市立师范学生李璞挑水要用大桶。孙警夷计划要在这次突击点种中争取入圈。不少同学们把肩膀都压红了，手也磨起泡了，但仍努力干下去。他们是那末高兴地唱着：“前方军队打胜仗，我们努力抗旱荒……”。驻临清的冀南农林学校师生，在五天内，突击点种棉花六百四十八亩。并利用吃饭的时间反复向群众宣传，打破了群众的思想顾虑。南宫中学师生三百二十人帮助该市东关东街、玉带街的烈、军、工属无劳力的贫苦群众点种。该校教员张子宝在来往三里远的井上，一气担了八担水。他们半天完成一天的预定任务。
　　民兵
    【冀南讯】邯郸县近千民兵，以战斗的姿态，积极参加突击播种。县委会在上月二十五日布置十天突击点种任务后，各区即分别召开民兵动员大会，号召民兵带领群众点种。西扶仁民兵班长周学章说：“我们这次点种要拿出过去跟敌人打仗的劲头来，“定要比群众点的多，点的快。”南吕屯全体民兵争先参加点种互助组，晚上持枪下地，保护水车，全县四个区，在他们的带头影响下，十天点种棉花七十一万九千亩，超过原点种计划一半以上。
