    英印加紧进行
    【新华社北平五日电】路透社堪培拉消息：伦敦会议以后，太平洋公约的谈判即将采取“更现时的方式”。值得注意的有下列几项消息。
    恰与伦敦会议闭幕同日（四月二十八日），印度国防使团到达了华盛顿，印代表团发言人普莱尔下机时公然宣称：他们到美国的首要任务是“与有关防务的美国官员进行会商”。又四月二十七日，印外次斯卡在其“巡游东南亚各国”的活动中到达西贡。
    访英三周的印海军司令泊尔莱于五月一日返抵印度，据他宣称，他与英当局商讨给印度以军舰的问题，并已将成功。
    印总理尼赫鲁在伦敦会议闭幕后，继续留在伦敦进行四天的活动。二日，尼赫鲁在离英前夕，曾与著名战争贩子邱吉尔同进晚餐。
