Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, New York dispatch: Despite the American reactionaries' attempts to obstruct Wallace's peace speaking tour, Wallace's tour is achieving great success. The mass rallies hosted by Wallace are always crowded. In the first week of his tour, tens of thousands of people attended rallies in the cities of Chicago, Boston, Cleveland, New York, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Baltimore. In most of the cities the peace speaking tour passed through, progressive forces organized receptions and banquets to welcome Wallace and the Italian Senator Gueye and British Member of Parliament Hacking who were traveling with him, and further mobilized local peace forces to support the peace movement. For example, in Detroit, Italian-American union members hosted Gueye, and at the meeting, sixty-six union leaders presented Gueye and Hacking with a "Peace Signature Book," guaranteeing that American workers would take united action in the global struggle to uphold peace and oppose new war challengers. The Baltimore rally, attended by more than 1,500 people, was particularly significant because it was the largest gathering held in that city since the passage of the anti-democratic McCarran Act (which provides for penalties of up to $20,000 and up to 20 years imprisonment for those who "engage in activities that endanger the country" or "participate in organizations that endanger the country" or engage in other conduct); Wallace denounced the bill as part of the mad rush to promote the North Atlantic Treaty and clear evidence of the growth of fascist tendencies in the United States. British MP Hacking, in his tour speeches, particularly emphasized that the British people know that the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Plan only mean hardship and suffering. Gueye's speech emphasized that Italian workers would never fight against the Soviet Union, a country of working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: New York dispatch: The Congress of American Women met in New York from the 6th to the 8th and passed a resolution urging American women to unite and "firmly support the United Nations to make it a true instrument of peace." The meeting also called for peaceful resolution of international disputes, rejection of the North Atlantic Treaty, and demanded that government budget expenditures be used for the people's social welfare measures, rather than for military preparations; repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act and discrimination against female workers within unions, etc.

    华莱士和平讲演旅行成功
    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：尽管美国反动派力图阻挠华莱士的和平讲演旅行，华氏旅行却正获得很大的成功。华莱士所主持的群众大会总是群众拥挤。在他的旅行的第一周，在芝加哥、波士吨、克里夫兰、城、纽约、底特律、明尼亚波利斯和巴尔的摩尔诸城，成千成万的人民参加了大会。在和平讲演旅行所经过的大部分城市里，进步力量都组织了欢迎华莱士和旅美的意大利参议员古亚及英国议员赫金生的招待会和宴席，并以更加动员党地的和平力量支持和平运动。例如，在底特律，祖籍意大利的美国工会人员招待古亚，会上六十六位工会领袖向古亚和赫金生赠献“和平签名录”，保证美国工人在全世界拥护和平反对新战争挑战者的斗争中采取一致行动。与会者达一千五百余人的巴的摩尔大会，尤其意义重大，因为这是自从反民主的盲拍法（该法规定对“进行危害国家的活动”或“参加危害国家的团体”及有其他行为的人予以二万美元以下及二十年以下有期徒刑的处罚）制定后，在那个城市举行的最大的一次集会；这个法案被华莱士斥为推行北大西洋公约的疯狂运动的一个组成部分和美国滋生法西斯偏向的明证。英会员赫金生在旅行讲演中，特别着重地指出：英国人民知道马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约计划，只是意味着困难与痛苦。古亚的讲演强调意大利工人永远不会对劳动人民的国家苏联作战。
    【新华社北平十二日电】纽约讯：美国妇女大会于六日至八日在纽约开会，通过决议，力促美国妇女团结起来，“坚决支持联合国组织，使成为和平的真正工具”。会议并呼吁和平解决国际争端，否决北大西洋公约，要求政府预算开支应用于人民社会福利措施上，而不要用在军事准备上；废除塔未脱——哈特莱法案及工会内对女工的歧视等。
