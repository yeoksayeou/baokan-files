　　Cooperative Bank Business Department
  　Adds Agricultural Loans for the Suburban Plains
  　Six Million Yuan Already Loaned to Nanyuan and Other Districts
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Cooperative Bank Business Department originally allocated 20 million yuan for agricultural loans in the suburban areas of Beiping this year, and it has already been fully distributed. Now, because various areas still feel it is not enough, the department, after consultation with the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government and other departments, decided to appropriately increase the amount based on the specific conditions of each district (such as purchasing cotton seeds and repairing water conservancy projects). As of the 20th of this month, the additional specialized agricultural loans disbursed include 2 million yuan to Nanyuan District, 3 million yuan to Changxindian District, and 1 million yuan to Tongxian District, totaling 6 million yuan.
