    Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 7th: Electric Communications: The New York State Committee of the American Communist Party announced that in recent weeks, more than 800 people have joined the American Communist Party. Furthermore, the New York Communist Party achieved remarkable results in its January fundraising campaign, raising a total of $650,000 from workers and sympathizers, of which $140,000 was donated to the Workers Daily fund and $50,000 was donated to the American Communist leaders on trial to cover defense costs. The New York State Committee of the American Communist Party stated: "The success of the fundraising campaign is a tribute to our loyal, increasingly strong, and increasingly mature party." The statement also said: "The fundraising campaign also shows that our party is gaining increasing support among the growing number of non-partisan, anti-imperialist workers. It further shows that the unprecedented attack of anti-communist slander and war hysteria has not achieved the impact on workers that Wall Street had hoped for." The committee also announced the success of the ongoing fundraising campaign to support American Communist Party Chairman Foster (who is currently being tried by a reactionary court).

    美共威信更加增强  八百多人最近入党
    工人大量捐款支援被审领袖
    【新华社北平七日电】电通讯社：美共纽约州委员会宣布：在最近数周内，有八百多人参加美国共产党。又纽约共产党在一月募捐运动中获得显著的成绩，共募得工人和同情者的捐款六十五万美元，其中十四万元是捐作工人日报的基金，五万元捐赠被审讯的美共领袖，作进行辩护费用。美共纽约州委员会声明称：“募捐运动的成绩是向忠心不渝、日益强大与日臻成熟的我们党的致敬。”声明又称：“募捐运动还显示我党在日益增多的无党派反帝工人中获得越来越多的支持。它更加显示：反共诬蔑与战争歇斯底里这种空前未有的进攻并没有获得如华尔街所期望的对于工人的影响。”该委员会也宣布了仍在进行中的支援福斯特美共主席（现正受反动法庭审讯中）募捐运动的成功。
