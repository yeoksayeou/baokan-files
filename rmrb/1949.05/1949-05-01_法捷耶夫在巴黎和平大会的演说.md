    But Vogt goes even further than his teacher Malthus, attempting to apply this anti-scientific theory to the positions of various countries and nations today. In his book, in a chapter titled "Too Many Americans," Vogt starts from the concept that "one hundred million people is the most suitable population for the United States." Therefore, the United States is inevitably threatened by a deterioration in living standards because, according to this view, the nation has forty-five million "excess people." But the situation in the United States is not entirely that bad. Like the German fascists who justified their aggression with "insufficient living space," Vogt uses America's "overpopulation" to explain the desire of certain groups to seize resources and territories from other countries.
    Vogt writes: Lead ore reserves are limited, so it is possible that we may have to fight to obtain lead ore. Elsewhere he writes: "Anticipating the depletion of our own oil fields, we send our navy to the Mediterranean, threaten the Soviet Union, and demand access to the oil resources of Asia..." (page 68).
    So you can see: what inspires the newfangled new war monger William Vogt (who has gained the support of the Ruhr area) is not the nature of Soviet cultural development. If there are still naive people who believe that the purpose of Marshallizing Western European countries and the so-called North Atlantic Treaty is indeed to improve the lives of the people of these countries, then I sincerely advise them to read Vogt's book again and again. Vogt writes: "Unfortunately, (I ask you to pay special attention to the words "Unfortunately"), despite the war, German atrocities, and malnutrition among the people of Europe, the population of Europe, excluding the Soviet Union, increased by eleven million between 1936 and 1946. It is estimated that by 1955, the population will reach 404 million, which is a 10 percent increase in twenty years. At that time, there will be 404 million (instead of 370 million) stomachs that will need to be filled three times a day with food from other countries. The number of hungry people is increasing, while the amount of land is not increasing" (pages 191-200 of the same book). Therefore, Vogt proposes that the only way out of this situation is to reduce the population of Europe. He writes: "Everything we do to increase the population of Europe is harmful to Europe and to ourselves. The stability that comes with a decrease in the European population will be the greatest contribution to universal peace and prosperity" (page 211 of the same book).
    Perhaps there are no such naive British people who believe that atomic weapons and the North Atlantic Treaty are really for defending British culture and ancient British humanism.
    Vogt's book convinces one that the creators of atomic weapons and the North Atlantic Treaty despise Britain just as much as they despise other countries. According to Vogt, the so-called "New World" has always been supporting Britain; without American aid, the British Industrial Revolution would not have occurred, but, in the current situation, Vogt writes: "If we want 50 million British people to rely on us for food, we will see hunger rampant on the streets of London again" (page 72 of the same book). This is indeed Vogt's attitude toward all other countries. He writes: "The most terrible tragedy in China today is the reduction in mortality rates. From a purely humanitarian point of view, famine in China is not only desirable but even necessary."
    He believes that the situation in Chile is favorable, writing: "One of the most favorable conditions in Chile today, or even the most favorable condition, is the high mortality rate" (page 186 of the same book).
    Vogt believes that the wisdom of the ancient Greeks "was manifested in something that historians rarely write about. Greece understood the constant danger of overpopulation and fought it resolutely by encouraging prostitution, infanticide, immigration, and colonization" (page 58 of the same book).
    If we talk about how Vogt most resolutely condemns the activities of doctors today, then why do we need to mention ancient Greece again? He writes: "Doctors concentrate their efforts on accomplishing one task—to save people from dying. Due to improvements in medicine and sanitation, they have taken on the responsibility of prolonging the lives of millions of poor people" (page 48 of the same book).
    Of course, Vogt's friends can accuse me of "propaganda." But I must declare that such demagoguery and the promoters of new wars are enemies of humanity, especially enemies of the American people; the American people, like us, do not want war, they, like us, do not want the extinction of humanity on earth, but want their happiness and prosperity. I, along with other Soviet cultural, artistic, and literary workers, participated in the American Cultural and Scientific Conference for Peace. We then believed that progressive elements in the American intellectual community genuinely wished to consolidate peace and establish mutual understanding between countries. Despite a considerable number of newspapers issuing hostile pronouncements, we were welcomed with friendliness and warmth everywhere, which may explain why the U.S. State Department and Justice Department demanded that we leave the United States quickly.
    We were very surprised when we learned some of the habits of the so-called "free" American newspapers. These newspapers reported demonstrations of nearly 100,000 people against our stay in the United States. In fact, there were no such demonstrations at all, only a few small groups of hired picketers. What we encountered was people gladly listening to us and understanding us. We then believed that differences on these issues or other issues concerning life and culture could not prevent honest and unbiased people from all countries from reaching a peaceful agreement to oppose those who incite war mania.
    People with compassion throughout the world, whether American or Soviet, cannot be indifferent to the following argument, which says: "Now is the time for humanity to be eliminated from the earth and let ants fill the world." Or, as Henry Miller (American reactionary novelist - editor's note) put it: "I hope and believe that the entire civilized world will disappear from the earth within a century." Can anyone fail to see that propagating such beliefs is a continuation of the theory of racial hatred of today, a theory that is now developing among some people and is needed by evil people to drag humanity into war.
    Regardless of the country, people of different political and religious beliefs in all countries have every right to call those who express such views of racial hatred enemies of humanity, first and foremost enemies of their own people.
    Now is the time to understand that this nihilism toward human life and the existence of civilization is corroding the souls of young people. Now is the time to understand that this nihilism encourages crime and homicidal tendencies.
    On March 14, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation publicly admitted that the number of crimes, which had reached a dangerous level, continued to grow. Throughout 1948, a major crime occurred in the United States every 18.7 seconds. On average, 36 people were assassinated and 255 women were raped every day. Every 24 hours, 463 cars were stolen and 2,672 other cases occurred. In 1948, the number of people arrested reached an unprecedented historical height, with 759,698 people fingerprinted. The most striking thing in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation report is that the number of crimes in 1948 increased greatly compared to the pre-war years of 1939 to 1940. The number of women raped increased by 49.9 percent, theft by 16.7 percent, assassination by 14.1 percent, and robbery by 8.9 percent. The most intriguing thing is that American newspapers of various tendencies attribute the increase in criminal cases to unprecedented levels of alcoholism and the corruption of youth.
    We have no right to think that even if a part of the youth is corrupted, they should be made criminals and evil murderers in future wars, just like those young people whom the German fascists instigated against humanity in the last World War.
    I call on all cultural workers, regardless of their nationality and race, regardless of their political or religious beliefs, to send out the great voice of humanism inherited from the best people of every country, against the warmongers, against their eulogizers and confidants. Our responsibility is to send out this voice for the mothers who give birth to our children. Our responsibility is to send out this voice for our children, because their lives and their future spiritual development depend on us.
    Whether we will be able to proudly talk about them as advocates of human progress in the future, or be saddened by their moral incompetence and depravity, all depends on the teachings we give them in mind and emotion. It is our responsibility to send out this great humanitarian voice against the warmongers, because millions of ordinary people all over the world expect this from us; they make up the majority of humanity, and in their hearts there is the best of every country and the best traditions of humanism.
    This World Peace Congress demonstrates the invincible power that cultural workers possess when they unite with millions of manual laborers. It is precisely this combination that most fully expresses the will of all peoples for consolidated peace. Let the new war provocateurs know: the people of the world can be angry and severely punish them.
    Let us send out our united voice against the war provocateurs and war eulogizers, against those who incite national and racial hatred and hostility. Defending peace is the responsibility of people all over the world. Uphold international friendship, for peace! Uphold world peace! (The End)

    法捷耶夫在巴黎和平大会的演说
    （英译）
    但是瓦格特甚至较他的教师马尔萨斯走得更远，他企图把这个反科学的理论应用到今日的各个国家和民族的位置上去。瓦格特在他的书中题为“美国人太多了”的一章中从下述概念出发，即“一万万人口是美国人口最合宜的数目”。因此，美国就不可避免的受到生活标准恶化的威胁，因为国家照这样说法有四千五百万的“过剩人口”。但是美国的处境不完全是那样坏。象以“生存空间不足”为其侵略辩护的德国法西斯一样，瓦格特以美国的“人口过剩”解释某些集团的攫取别国资源和领土的愿望。
    瓦格特写道：铅矿的贮藏是有限的，因此有可能我们会不得不为取得铅矿而打仗。在别处他写道：“预见到我们自己油矿的耗竭，我们派我们的海军到地中海，威胁苏联，并要求取得亚洲的石油富源……”（第六十八页）。
    所以你们可看出：激励花样翻新的新战争，歌颂者威廉。瓦格特（他获得了鲁区的支持）的东西，并不是苏联文化发展的性质。假如还有这种天真的人，认为使西欧国家马歇尔化和所谓北大西洋公约，其目的确是想改善这些国家人民的生活，那么我就竭诚奉告他们把瓦格特的著作读一遍，再读一遍。瓦格特写道：“不幸的很，（我请你们特别注意“不幸的很”这几个字），尽管有战争、德国的暴行和欧洲人民的营养不良，在一九三六年至一九四六年这段期间内，欧洲人口除苏联不计外，还增加了一千一百万。据断定：到一九五五年，人口将达到四亿零四百万，就是说二十年内增加百分之十。那时将有四亿零四百万（而不是三亿七千万）人的肚子，一天三餐要靠别国的粮食来填充。饥饿人口的数目在增长，而土地的数量却不增加”（同书一九九一—二○○页）。因此，瓦格特提出，这种情况的唯一出路，即减少欧洲人口的数目。他是这样写的：“我们为了增加欧洲人口所作的每一件事，对欧洲和对我们自己都是有害的。随欧洲人口减少而来的安定，将是对普遍和平与繁荣的最大贡献。（同书“二一一页）
    也许并没有这样天真的英国人，会认为原子武器与北大西洋公约，实在是为了保卫英国文化与古老的英国人道主义吧。
    瓦格特的书令人确信：原子武器与北大西洋公约的创造人蔑视英国，正象蔑视其他国家一样，据瓦格特说，所谓“新大陆”一直在供养着英国；要是没有美国的援助，英国的产业革命就不会发生，但是，在目前情况下瓦格特写道：“假若我们希望五千万英国人全都靠我们吃饭，我们就会又看到饥饿流行于伦敦街道上。”（同书七二十页）这的确是瓦格特对所有其他国家的态度。他写道：“目前中国最可怕的悲剧就是死亡率减低。从整个的人道观点来看，中国的饥馑不仅是要得的，而且甚至是必要的。”
    他认为智利的情况是有利的，他写道：“智利目前最有利的条件之一，或者甚至是最有利的条件，就是死亡率高。”（同书一八六页）
    瓦格特认为：古代希腊人的智慧“表现于历史学家很少写到的事情上。希腊懂得人口过剩的经常危险，以鼓励娼妓、灭婴、移民与殖民的方法与之进行坚决斗争”（同书五八页）。
    如果说到瓦格特如何最坚决地谴责现在医生的活动，那么我们又何必再提古希腊呢？他写道：“医生集中他们的力量来完成一件工作——把人救活不死。由于医药和卫生条件的改进，他们就担负了延长千百万贫苦人民的生命的责任（同书四十八页）。
    当然瓦格特的朋友们能谴责我在“宣传”。但是我必须声明：这种愚民主义和新战争的宣传者，才是人类的敌人，尤其首先是美国人民的敌人；美国人民和我们一样，不希望战争，他们和我们一样，不希望地球上的人类灭绝，而是希望他们的幸福与繁荣。我曾与其他苏联文化、艺术与文学工作者一道参加过美国文化与科学界拥护和平大会。我们于是相信美国知识界进步分子是真诚愿望巩固和平与建立各国间相互了解。尽管有相当多的报章发出敌视的论调，我们在各处仍受到友好而热诚的欢迎，这或者能够说明美国国务院和司法部为什么要求我们赶快离开美国。
    我们知道了所谓“自由的”美国报章的一些习惯时，我们很觉惊异。这些报章报导差不多有十万人参加的反对我们在美国停留的示威。事实上，根本没有什么这种示威，只是几小批受雇用的纠察人员而已。我们所遇到的是欣然倾听我们和了解我们。我们于是相信：在这些问题或其他关于生活与文化问题上的歧见，并不能阻止各国诚实而不具偏见的人达成和平协议，来反对鼓励战争狂的人。
    世界上凡是有同情心的人，不论是美国人或苏联人，对如下论调均不能漠不关心，这种论调说：“现在正是人类从地球上消灭而让蚂蚁充斥全世界的时候”。或如亨利·密勒（美国反动小说家——编者注）所称：“我希望且坚信整个文明的世界在一世纪内将从地球上消失”。难道任何人能够不看清宣传这样的信念是现今种族仇恨理论的继续，这种理论现在在一些人们中间发展，为邪恶的人们将人类卷入战争所需要。
    不论在那个国家，凡表示这种种族仇恨观点的人，我们不同政治与宗教信仰的各国人们完全有权利称他们为人类的敌人，首先是本国人民的敌人。
    现在是了解这种对人类生活及文明之存在的虚无主义腐蚀青年人灵魂的时候了。现在是了解这种虚无主义鼓励犯罪与杀人癖性的时候了。
    三月十四日美国联邦调查局公开承认，已经达到危险程度的犯罪的数字继续增长。一九四八年全年在美国每十八点七秒钟即有一件重大的犯罪案。每天平均有三十六个人遭暗杀和二百五十五个妇女被强奸。每二十四小时有四百六十三辆汽车被窃及二千六百七十二件其他案件。在一九四八年，被逮捕的人数达到历史空前的高度，有七十五万九千六百九十八个人按了手印。在美国联邦调查局的报告里最触目惊心的，是说到一九四八年比一九三九到一九四○战前年份犯罪的人数大大增加。强奸妇女的数目增加了百分之四九·九，偷窃百分之十六·七，暗杀百分之十四·一，抢劫百分之八·九。最耐人寻味的，是各种倾向的美国报纸把罪犯案件的增加归之于空前规模的酗酒及青年的堕落。
    我们没有权力认为即使一部分青年腐化，就要使他们在未来的战争中变成罪人，变成邪恶的凶手。象上次大战中德国法西斯嗾使反对人类的那些青年人一样。
    我号召一切文化工作者，不问其国籍与种族，不问其政治或宗教信仰，发出每一个国家最优秀人物所遗传给我们的人道主义的伟大声音，反对战争贩子，反对他们的歌颂者和心腹。我们的责任是为了给我们生儿育女的母亲们，发出这个声音。我们的责任是，为了我们的子女，发出这个声音，因为他们的生活和他们精神上今后的发展，都决定于我们。
    我们将来能够骄傲地谈到他们是人类进步的倡议者，或是为他们的道德上的无能与败坏而悲伤，全要看我们所给予他们脑筋和情感的教导。发出这个人道主义的反对战争贩子的伟大声音，是我们的责任，因为全世界千百万普通老百姓都期望我们这个；他们占人类的大多数，在他们的心中有着每一个国家的最好的东西，和人道主义的最好传统。
    这一个世界和平大会表现了文化工作者一与千百万体力劳动者结合起来的时候，他们所具有的不可征服的力量。恰恰是这种结合，最充分地表现了一切人民的巩固和平的意志。让新战争挑拔者们知道：世界的人民能够发怒并严厉惩罚他们。
    让我们发出我们联合的声音，反对战争挑拔者和战争歌颂者，反对煽动民族、种族的仇恨和敌意。保卫和平是全世界人民的责任。拥护国际间的友谊，为了和平！拥护全世界的和平！（完）
