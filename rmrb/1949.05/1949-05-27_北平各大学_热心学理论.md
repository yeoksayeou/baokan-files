　　Peking Universities
  　Enthusiastically Study Theory
    [Our Newspaper] Since the liberation of Peking, university students are universally reading and delving into books such as "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government," and are further systematically studying historical materialism and the new outlook on life, etc., to raise their theoretical level. The majority of students at Tsinghua University are in science and engineering. After realizing that professional study must be combined with political study, in addition to striving to learn scientific and cultural knowledge, they have now invited Comrade Ai Siqi to give systematic lectures on historical materialism. When lecturing on "On Ideology," there are more than two thousand listeners each time. In addition to students, there are also professors, teaching assistants, and staff members. At Peking University, Comrade He Ganzhi is teaching the history of social development. In addition to students who have selected the course, there are many auditing students, professors, teaching assistants, and middle school teachers from the city. The auditorium is not big enough, so people listen outside the auditorium. The Art Academy has weekly special lectures, with poets Ai Qing, writer Hu Feng, musician He Luting, and others successively lecturing on new literature and new art issues in connection with the actual situation of the Art Academy.

　　北平各大学
  　热心学理论
    【本报讯】北平解放后各大学学生正普遍阅读钻研“新民主主义论”、“论联合政府”等书籍，并进一步有系统地学习唯物史观和新人生观等，提高理论水平。清华大学学生大半为理工科学生，在认识了业务学习必须结合政治学习以后，除努力学习科学文化知识外，现已邀请艾思奇同志作唯物史观的系统演讲。在讲到“论思想意识”时，听讲的人每次有二千多。除学生外，还有教授、讲助教、职员。北京大学由何干之同志讲授社会发展史，听讲者除选课学生外，还有不少旁听学生、教授、讲助教和城内的中学教师。礼堂里坐不下，就在礼堂外面听。艺术专科学校则每星期有专题演讲，由诗人艾青、作家胡风、音乐家贺绿汀等先后联系艺专实际情况，讲授新文艺、新艺术诸问题。
