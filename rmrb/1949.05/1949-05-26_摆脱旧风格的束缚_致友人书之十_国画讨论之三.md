　　Breaking Free from the Shackles of Old Styles
  　——Tenth Letter to a Friend——
  　Third Discussion on Traditional Chinese Painting
    Wang Chaowen
    I have read your submissions to the exhibition. Abandoning old themes irrelevant to social issues and beginning to depict new things is a very commendable progress. Whether it is the use of indirect depiction methods, the techniques of Chinese brush and ink and color application, or the poetic rather than dryly explanatory inscriptions, all demonstrate that you have utilized your existing cultivation and achieved considerable success under new endeavors. This achievement is sufficient to answer the prejudices of those who doubt or deny the possibility and future development of the transformation of Chinese painting. Although these works have some shortcomings, they do not obscure their progressive significance and new fundamental spirit. However, we must further consider how to overcome the remaining shortcomings and achieve harmony between content and form to reach the higher standards that should be achieved. I am not prepared to offer specific opinions on your works, but I would like to talk to you about issues related to the utilization of old forms.

    Some viewers criticize that the expressive forms of our colleagues are outdated and lack freshness. This criticism is not comprehensive, but it is indeed worth being vigilant about. Many works really have the problem of forcibly stuffing new content into old forms. Some backgrounds are completely beautiful old landscape paintings, which are very inconsistent with the new content; some figures are even reluctant to change their old costumes, making the audience face ancient people today; rough laborers are still treated with delicate brushwork, making the audience think they are painting court ladies. There are many reasons for these shortcomings. One of the reasons is the prevalence of traditional aesthetic concepts, the unconditional preservation of old styles (whether conscious or unconscious). You will understand this, but the works show the shackles of the old style, and the failure to focus more on the creation of new images cannot but be attributed to the preference for the old style, right?

    Whether it is untamed, luxurious, elegant, or refined, they were all formed by artists in the feudal era, both in and out of the court, based on their certain aesthetic concepts and their creative purposes or descriptive objects (indulging themselves, embellishing reality, anesthetizing the people). Fishermen and woodcutters look beautiful to them, a beauty of being "unrestrained," a beauty of being "beyond the world." The image of laborers under this subjective gaze, appearing in the paintings, loses the true nature of the poor and hardworking oppressed, and is given the carefree, content, and ancient character that poets and painters who love leisure idealize. Under this creative intention, a pattern, tone, and brushwork adapted to it will inevitably be formed. From their standpoint, this is an appropriate form of expression and style. However, this form and style cannot be used to express the oppressed laborers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, nor can it be used to describe the laborers in the liberated areas. Insisting on dogmatic application tramples on the object and damages the exploration of new expressive power. The positive and collective labor scenes of the new peasants, if too much emphasis is placed on a sense of stability based on a quiet and solemn taste in the layout, are inappropriate no matter what (although it is not necessary to make a domineering composition or a fierce god-like image). This kind of utilization of the old form is really not a utilization. Attempting to create a style that looks exactly like traditional Chinese painting is actually an unconditional preservation of the old tradition.

    Although the brush and ink of Chinese painting are not as emphasized as those who advocate Oriental civilization supremacy, they do have their universally existing strengths: concise, bright, and even meticulous, but not cumbersome. These are readily accepted by the masses' appreciation habits, and are worthy of attention and promotion. However, for those standardized "cun fa" (wrinkling techniques) and the like, we must distinguish what real things the ancients based on in their descriptions and what creative intentions they had in their development. We must not swallow them whole without asking for practical needs and without criticism, and use them casually. In particular, the calligraphic interest emphasized by literati painting must be re-evaluated particularly strictly, and we must understand what attitude and purpose it was formed with. If we over-respect it, and want the image to obey it, rather than it being dominated by the needs of the image, then it just shows that we are still conceptually obeying the old aesthetic concepts - the formalistic concepts that are divorced from practice, and the dogmatic and uncritical use of old forms, which is very harmful to the formation of the due new style.

    In the final analysis, the transformation of the old style mainly depends on the practice of life and the transformation of thoughts and feelings, especially the cultivation of a passion for truly serving the masses. It is far from enough for us, who have been nurtured in feudal art for a long time, to simply work on the expressive form itself. This truth has become common sense, and it only needs to be practiced, but the important thing is: first, we must strictly and deeply examine our aesthetic concepts, and first, we must abandon the existing preferences for old forms and old styles (especially literati painting and various European modern schools). If we do not do this, it will not be easy to consolidate existing achievements, and greater development will not be possible.

    Saying this does not deny the efforts and existing achievements of our colleagues, but only to put forward this suggestion for further research.

　　摆脱旧风格的束缚
  　——致友人书之十——
  　国画讨论之三
    王朝闻
    你在展览会的出品我已经拜读了。抛弃了与社会问题无关的旧题材，开始描绘新的事物，这是很可庆幸的进步。不论侧面描写的方法之运用也好，中国笔墨及设色技巧也好，诗意的而非枯燥的说明的题词也好，在在都说明你利用了旧有的修养，在新的企图下，获得了相当成绩。这成绩，足够回答怀疑或否定中国画改造之可能性及其发展前途的论者的偏见。这些作品，虽然存在着好些缺点，并不因此淹没了它的进步意义，和新的基本精神。但是，必须进一步考虑，如何才能克服尚存的缺点，做到内容和形式的和谐，以达到应有的更高的水准，我不准备具体的对你的作品提什么意见，只想和你谈谈与利用旧形式有关的问题。
    有的观众批评同仁们的表现形式陈旧，缺少新鲜气息。这批评不够全面，但确是值得警惕的。好些作品真有把新内容硬装进旧形式的毛病。有些背景完全是旧山水那样优美的背景，和新内容很不相称；有的人物连旧服装也舍不得改变，叫观众今天面对着古人；粗豪的劳动者仍然以纤丽的笔墨处理，观众以为在画着仕女。形成这类缺点的原因很多，原因之一，是传统的审美观念在作祟，是旧风格的无条件的保留（不论是自觉与不自觉的保留）。关于这，你不会不理解的，但作品上表现出了旧格调的束缚，没有能够更着重新形象之创造，不能不归究于旧风格的偏爱吧？
    不论野逸也好，豪华也好，淡雅也好，典丽也好，也都是封建时代在野在朝的美术家，根据他一定的审美观念和其创作目的或描写对象（陶醉自己，粉饰现实，麻醉人民）而形成的。渔樵在他们看起来美，是潇洒的美，“无羁”的美，“超世”的美，这种主观主义的眼光下的劳动者，出现在画子里的形象，失去穷困和辛勤的被压迫者的本色，而赋予爱好闲适的诗人画家所理想的那样无忧、自得、高古的性格。这样的创作意欲下，必然形成了适应它的格局、色调、笔法。以他们的立场而论，这是恰当的表现形式和风格。但是，这种形式，这种风格，用以表现被压迫的蒋区劳动人民不可，用之于描写解放区的劳动人民也要不得。硬要教条主义的搬用，槽践了对象，也损毁了新表现力的探求。新的农民之积极的、集体的劳动场面，要是太强调安定感的以静穆的趣味出发的布局，不论如何是不相称的（虽然不一定作霸气十足的构图，凶神似的形象）。这样的旧形式的利用，实在不算利用。企图要作出恰象国画的风格，实际上是无条件的保留旧传统。
    中国画的笔墨，虽然不如所谓东方文明至上论者那样强调，确有他的普遍存在着的长处，简练、明快，即令绵密，并不繁琐。--这些，既为群众欣赏习惯所乐于接受，值得重视，值得发扬。但是，对待那些条律化了的皴法之类，又必须辨别古人是根据什么事物的实际之描写以及什么创作意图而发生发展起来的，切不可以不问实际需要不加批判生吞活剥，随便搬用。特别是文人画所强调的书法趣味，更要特别严格的重新估价，认识他是什么态度和目的而形成的。如果过分尊崇，要形象服从它，而不是它受形象需要所支配，则正好说明自己还在观念上服从旧的审美观念--脱离实践的形式主义的观念，教条主义的无批判的旧形式利用，很有害于应有之新风格的形成的。
    归根到底，旧风格的改造主要依靠于生活实践，及思想感情的改造，特别是真正为群众服务的热情的培养，曾经长期薰陶在封建艺术里的我们单纯的在表现形式本身用功夫是很不够的。这道理不用说已经成了常识，只消实践就行，但要紧的是：首先要严格的深入的检讨我们的审美观念，首先要割舍尚存在着的，对于旧形式、旧风格的偏爱（特别是文人画及欧洲现代诸流派）。不如此，现有的成绩不易巩固，更大的发展没有可能。
    这样说，并非否定了同仁们的努力和已有的成绩，只是为了更进一步而提这意见来研究。
