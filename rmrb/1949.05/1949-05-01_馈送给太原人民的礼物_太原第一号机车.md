    A Gift to the People of Taiyuan
    Taiyuan's First Locomotive
    Xiǎo Zhōu
    On the morning of April 21st, the Western Front engineering team heard the good news that Taiyuan was about to be liberated. The brothers in the engineering team made a heroic vow: as soon as Taiyuan falls, the tracks will be connected in two days.
    It seemed that the "Taiyuan" locomotive C155 from the locomotive factory wouldn't have time to be refurbished. Acting Director Liu Chunhe had a stroke of genius. He consulted with other comrades and requested instructions from the Locomotive Department. He decided to process and repair the C1527 locomotive, which was about to leave the factory, ahead of schedule, and designate it as "Taiyuan No. 1." C155 would continue to be refurbished as the second gift to the people of Taiyuan.
    Everyone agreed. The Locomotive Department also gave special instructions: do not cut corners, pay attention to quality.
    When Comrade Liu Chunhe conveyed this urgent task to the workers in the refurbishment workshop, enthusiastic cheers resounded in the workshop: "Let's do it!" "Let's go!" As soon as the foreman made the arrangements, more than a dozen workers ran towards the locomotive frame. Young worker Liu Ruping was the first to raise his hammer and knock off the rust on the frame.
    The painters came, the welders and riveters also came. Twenty or so people measured every part back and forth around this steel monster. The foreman used a three-section meter stick to measure the size of the main connecting rod (i.e., the axle connecting rod), the wheel rims, and the main axle, clearly writing the chalk words on the crossbar: "Take it all apart for a major cleaning."
    "It's going to meet new people, so we have to give it a new set of clothes!" said the painter, scraping off the greasy cylinder head.
    The long main connecting rod and connecting rod were lifted onto the planer.
    The drawbar was also removed and its straightness was measured.
    Throughout the workshop, the clanging sound became a rhythmic symphony. The workers in the refurbishment workshop said with confidence: "No problem, we'll definitely make the deadline."
    The urgent task was relayed to the boiler shop. The pipe fitter opened the smoke chamber door and plunged into the dark boiler. Then there was a burst of ear-piercing, noisy, and crisp sounds of steel impacting steel.
    The welder put on his iron mask, the dazzling welding sparks scorched the steel skin, and pale blue sparks scattered in the blue sky. For two days, the workers in the boiler shop had been working silently, without complaining.
    Again and again inspections were made, and every rivet was stained with the oil from the workers' hands. Finally, the boiler was filled with water, and everyone squatted down to look, some putting their ears to the outside of the boiler, listening like a doctor listening to a patient's breathing. Wherever a drop of water appeared, they drew a white line. Then came the blinding flash of welding. The boiler shell, with its thousands of rivets, finally had not a single trace of water.
    On the morning of the 22nd, the crane (note 1), like a crow carrying a small stick, placed the boiler safely on the frame.
    The 24th was Sunday. After the boiler was installed, the work on the entire frame was no light task! Yesterday—the 23rd—after working all day without finishing, oilers Xie Sixiang, Ren Changming, and refurbishment workers Zhang Xiuke, Wang Qiufu, Liu Yuhua, and twenty others voluntarily requested to work overtime.
    At six o'clock in the morning, other workers came to the factory early to collect sawdust and shavings, while Lao Xie and the other twenty-three people picked up their tools and started working. The newly made putty was mixed like ointment, fragrant and pleasant. The veteran painting foreman told me, "We're going to use spray paint this time. After the test run tomorrow, it's going to Taiyuan."
    The locomotive took off its oily black clothes, shining brightly and pleasingly.
    That evening, the Nanjing, the central city of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and Taiyuan, which had been ruled by the Yan bandit for nearly forty years, were simultaneously declared liberated.
    "Taiyuan has fallen, we must strive to fire it up today!"
    The entire workshop was plunged into even more intense work.
    The original wheels were hanging on the crane. The shaper was planing the water tank axle bushing. The cylinder heads and the entire locomotive body were dressed as if they were wearing new shirts, and even the "bie'er" (note 2) was polished to a golden shine. New screw nuts were screwed onto the water pump connecting pipes on both sides of the air pump, and the sandboxes were tightly fastened. Every screw was clamped three or five times with pliers. "Taiyuan No. 1" was completed that evening as victoriously as the liberation of Taiyuan.
    (Note 1) Crane, which is a crane, is what the workers often call it.
    (Note 2) Bie'er is the whistle.

    馈送给太原人民的礼物
    太原第一号机车
    晓洲
    四月二十一号早晨，西线工程队听到捷报，说太原马上就要打开了，工程队的弟兄们发出豪壮的誓言：只要太原一下来，两天功夫就可以接轨。
    机厂的“太原号”机车Ｃ１５５号看样子是来不及装修了。代理厂长刘春和同志急中生智，他给领导上其他同志一商量，同时请示了机务处，就把最近可以出厂的Ｃ１５２７号机车加工修复，提前出厂，作为“太原第一号”，Ｃ１５５号仍继续装修，作为送给太原人民的第二件礼物。
    大家都同意了。机务处还特别关照：不要因陋就简，要注意质量。
    刘春和同志给装修所工友们一传达这项紧急任务，车间里响起了激动的欢呼：“干呀”！“加油啦”！领班的一布置，十多个工友就向车架子跑去了。年青的工友刘汝平，第一个举起榔头来敲打着车架上的铁锈。
    油漆匠来了，电焊匠和铆工也都来了。二十来个人在这架钢铁怪物的旁边来回测度着每一件零件，领班的用三节米达尺测量主动杆（即轴连棒），轮边和大轴的尺码，在横档上面清晰的写出粉笔字：“都拆下来大扫除”。
    “要见新人啦，得跟它换件衣裳才行！”油漆匠在刮着满敷油腻的汽缸盖说。
    丈多长的主动杆和主动连杆被抬上了刨床子。
    拉杆儿也卸下来测量着它的曲直。
    整个车间外面，当啷的声音响成了很有节奏的交响曲。装修所的工友们满有信心地说：“没啥问题，咱们准赶上时间了”。
    紧急任务传进了制炉所，管子匠一手拉开烟室门儿就耸身窜进黑压压的锅炉去了，接着就是一片刺耳的嘈杂而清脆的钢和钢的冲击的爆鸣。
    电焊匠带上铁的面具，刺眼的电焊火花煎烧着钢皮，淡青色的火星播散在青空里，制炉所的工友们，两天来都在默默地干着活儿，谁也没啃过气。
    一次再一次的检查，每颗铆钉上面都染上了工友们手上的油污。最后，锅炉里压上水了，大家都蹲下去瞧，有的把耳朵贴在锅炉的外壳上听，就好象听病人呼吸的大夫一样，在任何冒出水珠来的地方，都给它画上一道白线。接着是电焊的刺眼的闪光。满身千多颗铆钉的锅炉外壳，终于没有任何一点点水痕。
    二十二号早晨，吊车（注一）象老鸦含着一根小木棍一样，锅炉安安稳稳的放在车架上了。
    二十四号是礼拜天，锅炉装上以后，整个车架子上的活儿就可不轻哩！昨天——二十三号，干了一天没干完，油匠解思祥、任长明和装修所张修科、王秋福、刘玉华等二十三人，就自动要求加班。
    早晨六点钟，其他的工友们一早到厂来领锯末和刨花，而老解他们二十三个人摸起家伙就干开了。新法制的腻子调得象油膏一样，香喷喷的。老油漆匠领班的告诉我说：“咱们这次要使喷漆。等明儿个溜车以后，就要上太原了。”
    车头脱掉油污的黑衣，亮晃晃的好不惹人高兴。
    当天黄昏，国民党反动统治的中心南京名城和阎匪统治将近四十年的太原同时宣告解放了。
    “太原下来了，今天无论如何得争取点火！”
    整个车间便都卷进这一更形紧张的工作。
    元车上吊着主轮。牛头刨在刨水柜轴瓦。汽缸盖和整个机车的身体也都象穿上了新衬褂，连“蹩儿”（注二）也擦得黄澄澄的。气泵两边的水泵接水管套上了新旋的螺丝母，沙箱也扣得严严的了。每一颗螺丝都被老虎钳钳了三五遍，“太原第一号”就在当天晚上正如解放太原一样胜利的完成了。
    （注一）吊车，就是起重机，工友们常这样称呼它。
    （注二）蹩儿就是汽笛。
