　　Misunderstanding
    Rùn Cāng
    This incident happened before a battle.

    In a mountain gully, there was a motor road. The stone cliffs on both sides of the motor road were as straight as iron plates. Standing on the cliff and looking down, it was dizzyingly deep. On the north bank of the deep gully, a winding path for herding sheep lay at the foot of the mountain. At the biggest bend in this path, there flowed a stream of water as bright as glass. Following the water, there was a patch of reeds, the reeds and thatch swaying in the wind. Behind it were two overlapping big mountains. It was hard to imagine that there would be a narrow gully nestled between these two overlapping big mountains. Walking up along the gully, there was a thatched cottage halfway up the mountain. A family lived inside. Standing by the low wall made of stones by this family, one could clearly see the movements of people on the motor road.

    Li Zhong walked along, thinking about his reconnaissance:

    Standing on the mountain, he could clearly see everything in the city below, as if it were happening right under his feet. No pedestrians were seen outside the city, the city gates were tightly closed, and only a few listless reactionary troops were moving around on the city walls. Countless vehicles had arrived at the edge of the city, and the bandit troops were hurriedly carrying things and concentrating towards the vehicles. There was no doubt that these guys were preparing to escape. This kind of chaos among the enemy increased Li Zhong's strength. His feet seemed to not touch the ground as he ran back to the village like flying. When he stumbled over a stone, he forgot the pain when he got up to run again. He was only thinking about not missing this opportunity to annihilate the enemy.

    When he ran to the entrance of the gully to the house where he often used as a reconnaissance base, he decided to inform the fellow villager. If the enemy escaped, he would ask the fellow villager to send a message quickly. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, an unexpected and shocking event occurred:

    A tall, dark man in a blue jacket jumped out from behind a large rock and shouted, "Stop! Hands up!" A pistol was pointed at Li Zhong's head. In that instant, Li Zhong suddenly realized that the person in front of him was an enemy. He suddenly swung the stick in his hand, hitting the man's wrist, causing the pistol to fall onto the rocks in the distance with a crash. Li Zhong reached out to draw his gun from his waist, but before he could pull his hand back, the other man's other hand grabbed him. Li Zhong put one arm around the man's neck, while the man's thick arm blocked Li Zhong's waist. The two wrestled and fell on the hillside like a roof. The man was struggling to push Li Zhong down the hillside to his death, but Li Zhong held onto a tree branch. Li Zhong mustered all his strength to pull out the hand that had grabbed the pistol and give the man a shot in the chest. But the man desperately pinned Li Zhong's fist behind his back. Both sides wanted to kick the other to death with their legs, and both sides wanted to raise their fists to knock the other to death, but both sides used their last bit of strength, and still could not raise their fists or extend their legs, because the two sides were firmly entwined together. They bit each other's shoulders through their clothes. The two wrestled and rolled down the terraced hillside. They were exhausted to the extreme. When Li Zhong felt that he had no strength left, he thought: "Chairman Mao told me to carry the revolution through to the end." His spirit was renewed, and he had strength again. The other man's two red eyes seemed to be on fire, fiercely retorting at Li Zhong. Neither side thought that they were exhausted, but only had one determination—to resolutely defeat the other.

    Just at this moment, the three-year-old little girl playing outside the small cottage saw them wrestling and rolling down the cliff. She fell and got up, got up and fell, running back to the cottage, hugging her mother's leg with one hand, and pointing to the cliff with the other little hand, crying and shouting:

    "Mom... Comrade...!"

    Hearing the child's incoherent words, her father guessed that something had happened to the reconnaissance comrade—Li Zhong. He dropped his bowl and ran down the slope to take a look. Sure enough, someone was wrestling with Li Zhong and rolling around. Good! Who dares to go against Li Zhong? He went back to the house, grabbed a hoe handle and rushed down. The thirteen-year-old boy also dragged a small iron shovel behind him. The landlord was determined to smash the enemy's brains out with the hoe handle. Terrible, when he ran not far from the place where Li Zhong and the enemy were wrestling, he raised his stick to strike down, but the two were wearing blue clothes, and he couldn't tell them apart. He ran over and grabbed two heads to find out which one was Li Zhong. The first one he saw was Zhang Yong, whose face was pressed against Li Zhong's ear. Zhang Yong's face was pale, and he was panting heavily.

    The landlord seemed to have been bitten by a poisonous insect, and shouted sharply: "Oh!" The second one he saw was Li Zhong, who was startled and glanced sideways. The landlord pounced straight down, separating the two. When Li Zhong struggled and punched him hard in the ribs, he shouted, "He is Zhang Yong of the 43rd Regiment, he is Li Zhong of the 48th Regiment, they are all our own people."

    Zhang Yong let go of his hand and slowly sat down on a flat stone, his mouth so dry that he couldn't spit out phlegm, drowsy and dizzy. Li Zhong leaned against the stone, closed his eyes, and only felt that the air in front of him was constantly blooming, and he was about to fall asleep, but his mind was buzzing like mosquitoes, and he couldn't sleep. The landlord's boy rested his chin on the handle of the small iron shovel, staring at them with his bright eyes from afar. The house owner ran back to the thatched cottage to bring them soup.

    Li Zhong cheered up and turned around and said, "I guess the enemy doesn't have that kind of guts."

    Zhang Yong slowly agreed, "I also think it's very rare, I've never seen such a tenacious enemy." The two of them caressed each other's bruises from the misunderstanding. The comradeship made them both speechless for a moment. ...

    A sharp and startling gunshot shattered the tranquility of the earth, gradually, gradually, echoing into a chorus. The gunshots shook off all the fatigue from Zhang Yong and Li Zhong, and their spirits immediately lifted. "It's started!" Li Zhong shouted, grabbed his gun, and ran straight towards the dense gunfire. Zhang Yong followed closely without a word.

    "Comrades! Have a bowl of soup before you go, comrades...!" The landlord was carrying the soup and shouting behind them. The boy picked up his small iron shovel and followed them.

　　误会
    润苍
    这件事情是发生在作战以前。
    在一条山沟里，有一条汽车路，汽车路两边的石头崖就象铁板一样的笔直，站在崖上朝下看，深得叫人发晕。深沟的北岸上，有一条弯弯曲曲的放羊的小路躺在山脚上。在这条小路朝下弯得最大的一个弯上，流着一股象玻璃亮样的水。顺水看去，是一片苇子，苇茅随着风摆来摆去。后面就是交错的两片大山。谁都很难想到，在这交错的两片大山的夹窝里还会有一条窄沟。顺着沟走上去，在半山腰里有一座草房。里边住着一家人家。站在这家人家用石头砌成的矮墙边，就可以清冽冽的看到汽车路上人们的行动。
    李忠一边走一边想着他侦察的经过：
    站在山上清清楚楚看出了山下城里的一切情形，就象在脚下活动一样。城外不见行人，城门已经紧闭，城墙上冷清清的只走动着几个没劲的反动派军队的哨兵。城边开来了无数辆汽车，匪军们乱烘烘的背着东西朝汽车集中。无疑问的，这些家伙是准备逃跑。这种敌人的混乱不堪给李忠增加了力量，脚下就象蹬不着地一样，飞样的朝回里跑。石头拌倒了，爬起来再跑时忘记了痛楚。一心只想到不能失掉这个歼灭敌人的机会。
    跑到他经常做为侦查基点的人家的沟口时，决心去告老乡一声，倘若敌人逃跑，叫老乡赶快送信。忽然象晴天的霹雳一样，一桩想不到的惊人事件发生了：
    从一块大石后跳出一个穿青大褂的黑大个子，吆喝一声：“站住！举起手来”。盒子枪朝着李忠的头上顶来。就在这一霎时，李忠猝然意会到脸前是一个敌人。猛然抡起手里的棍子，揍得那人的手腕朝旁边一抡，哗啦一声，盒子枪摔到老远的石头上。李忠伸手要从腰间掏枪，没等拉回手来，那人的另外一只手却抱了过来。李忠一手搂住那人的脖子，那人的粗胳膊却拦住李忠的腰。两人撕扭着倒在房檐一样的山坡上。那人吃劲的要推李忠滚下山坡去摔死，李忠却抓住一根树枝不放。李忠运足力气要掣出抓住盒子枪的一只手来，照那人的胸口给他一枪；那人却吃劲的将李忠的拳头别在他的腰后边。双方的腿都要将对方一脚踹死，双方的拳头都想举起来将对方敲死，但双方把最后一点劲都使出来了，仍旧是拳抬不起、腿也伸不开，因为双方已结结实实的撕扭在一起了。他们相互的隔着衣服咬住了对方的肩膀。双方撕扭着滚下梯子一样的层层的山坡。他们已经疲倦到了极点。当李忠的身上没有任何力气了的时候，想道：“毛主席告诉我的，要将革命进行到底”。精神焕发了，有了力气了。对方两只红红的眼睛就象要冒火，凶狠狠的回敬着李忠。双方谁都没想到自己已筋疲力竭，只有一个决心——坚决战胜对方。
    就在这时候，在小草房外面玩耍的三岁小女孩，看到他们撕扭着滚下崖去。跌倒爬起、爬起跌倒的跑回小屋里去，一手抱着她娘的腿，一只小手直指崖下连哭带叫：
    “娘……同志……！”
    听到孩子吐不清的话，她爹就猜透侦查的同志—李忠发生了事故。丢下饭碗跑下坡去瞧了瞧，果然有人撕住李忠滚来滚去的。好！谁敢和李忠做对？回到屋里，抓起一根锄把就朝下窜。十三岁的大小子也拖着一把小铁锨跟在后面。房东一心要拿锄把砸出敌人的脑浆来。糟糕，跑到离李忠和敌人撕扭的地方不远时，举起棍来就要朝下打，原来两人穿的都是青色衣服，分辨不清。他跑过去抓住两个脑袋要寻出那个是李忠来，第一个看到的却是将脸压在李忠耳朵上的张勇。张勇的脸色发青，直喘粗气。
    房东好象被毒虫子咬着了，尖锐的惊叫了一声：“噢！”第二次被看到的才是被惊得略微别过脸来瞅了一眼的李忠。房东直着扑下去，隔在两人的中间。李忠挣起拳头狠狠的敲在他的肋骨上时，他才喊出：“他是四十三团张勇，他是四十八团李忠，都是自家人”。
    张勇松开手缓慢的坐到一方平整的石头上去，口干得黏痰都吐不出来，困困盹盹，眼前发眩。李忠倚在石头上，闭着两眼，只觉脸前的空气象不断的在泛花，昏昏沉沉的就要睡去，可是脑子里嗡嗡的象蚊子叫一样，又睡不着。房东的大小子把下额搁在小铁锨把上，瞪着两只有神的小眼睛老远的直瞅着他们。屋东跑回草房给他们端汤去了。
    李忠振作了一下，回头说：“谅想敌人就没这样有种”。
    张勇缓缓的随和着：“我也觉得很稀罕，从没见过这样顽强的敌人。”他们两人互相抚摸着误打的伤痕，同志的亲切使他们两个一时都说不出话来。……
    一声尖利得惊人的枪声冲碎了大地的恬静，渐渐地，渐渐地响成一片。枪声振掉了张勇和李忠身上的一切疲劳，精神立刻抖擞起来。“打响了！”李忠叫了一声抓起枪一直朝着浓密的枪炮声飞跑。张勇一声不吭紧跟上。
    “同志们！喝口汤再走，同志们……！”房东端着汤在背后赶着吆喝。大小子扛起小铁锨，也跟随着他们赶上去。
