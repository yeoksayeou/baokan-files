Introducing Zhao Hengqi's Cotton Seedling Cultivation and Transplanting Method
    Tian Huonong, Ma Pengyun
    Implementing cotton seedling cultivation and transplanting has three benefits: ① It avoids delays in the sowing period due to drought, facilitating seedling preservation; ② Missing seedlings can be replanted, increasing cotton field yield; ③ When little land is left for cotton, wheat stubble land can be utilized for cotton planting. Currently, with drought conditions making sowing difficult in various regions, this method can be implemented. Now, we introduce the method of Zhao Hengqi from the 15th District of the Southern Suburbs of Beiping for reference in various regions:
    Seedling Cultivation Method: First, soak the seeds in boiling water for a while, then add cold water and soak overnight. The next day, prepare the ridges and water them thoroughly. Wait for the water to seep in before sowing, covering with fine soil about seven-tenths of an inch thick. After the seedlings emerge, watering may not be necessary if it is not very dry.
    Transplanting Method: When the cotton seedlings grow one or two true leaves (cotton first grows two cotyledons, and then true leaves), transplant them (transplanting when they are a little bigger is also possible). Before uprooting the seedlings, water the ridges thoroughly to ensure the seedlings are uprooted with a clod of soil. Each two seedlings form one clump. Use a small trowel to dig them up, then squeeze the clod of soil tightly to prevent the soil from scattering and exposing the roots. As cotton seedlings have deep roots, dig deeply to minimize root damage, which will improve survival. The uprooted seedlings should still be placed on the ridges, covered with mats to avoid sun exposure, and sprayed with a watering can twice daily. After three to five days, transplant the seedlings into the field. When transplanting, first dig a pit, water it, and transplant the cotton seedlings into the pit before the water dries up. Cover with soil once the water has seeped in appropriately (others' experience is that transplanting on rainy days allows for immediate uprooting and transplanting, and the seedlings survive well after compacting the soil and watering).

　　介绍赵恒祺的棉花养苗和移栽法
    田活农　马鹏云
    实行棉花养苗和移栽，有三个好处：①不会因旱天而耽误播种期，便于保苗；②缺苗可以补栽，增加棉田收获；③棉田留得少时可以利用麦槎地栽棉花。现在各地天旱播种困难，可实行此法，现在我们介绍北平南郊十五区的赵恒祺的方法供各地参考：
    养苗法：先将种籽用开水泡一会，后对凉水，泡一夜，第二天把畦子整好浇透，等水渗干播种，上盖细土约七分厚，苗出土后，如不很旱可以不浇水。
    移栽法：待棉苗长出一二个真叶（棉花先长两个籽叶，以后才生真叶）时，即移植（再大一些移植也可以）。起苗前须在畦里浇一次大水，以便起苗带土台。每两棵成一台。用小铁铲挖起后，即把土台捏紧，以免土散露出根，棉苗根深要挖得深点，尽量少伤根，这样好活。起的苗仍放在畦里，用席片盖上，不要晒太阳，并用喷壶每日喷两次水，放三、五日后再将苗栽在地里。栽时先挖坑、浇水，待水未干即将棉苗栽在坑内，等水渗适即盖土（别人的经验是在雨天栽，可以随起苗随栽，栽后把土压紧浇些水，也活得很好）。
