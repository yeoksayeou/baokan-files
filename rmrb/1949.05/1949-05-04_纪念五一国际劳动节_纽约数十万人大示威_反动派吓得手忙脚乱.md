    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd:  Telecommunications Agency, New York: The New York Committee of the Communist Party of the United States called for a demonstration parade of hundreds of thousands of people on the evening of the 30th to celebrate "May Day," frightening the reactionaries who mobilized one-third of the city's police force, 50,000 strong, to "prevent disorder." The police organized a so-called "Loyalty Day" parade in an attempt to divert people's attention from the labor people's holiday. Those mobilized to participate in this so-called "Loyalty Day" were some reactionary veteran "patriotic" groups and backward trade union members. On the eve of "May Day," progressive labor leaders from Romania, France, and the Philippines sent telegrams to the Communist Party of the United States, paying their respects for their heroic struggle under the brutal persecution of the American government.

    纪念五一国际劳动节
    纽约数十万人大示威
    反动派吓得手忙脚乱
    【新华社北平二日电】电通社纽约讯：美国共产党纽约党委会于三十日晚号召了几十万人举行“五一”示威大游行，吓得反动派调集全市三分之一的警察五万人来“防止秩序混乱”。警察组织了所谓“精忠节”游行，企图以此分散人民对劳动人民节日的注意。被动员来参加这个所谓“精忠节”的是一些反动的退伍军人“爱国”社团和落后的劳工联合会会员。在“五一”前夕，罗马尼亚、法国、菲律宾的进步劳工领袖，曾电在美国政府残酷迫害下英勇斗争的美国共产党致敬。
