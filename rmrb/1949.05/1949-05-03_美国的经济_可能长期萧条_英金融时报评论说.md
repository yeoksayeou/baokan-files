Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd -- TASS, London: The Financial Times (belonging to the Camrose Group, with considerable influence in banking circles) commented on the U.S. economic situation, stating: "There is now talk of the possibility of a prolonged depression, which has already reached a considerable extent." The paper pointed out: "U.S. wholesale prices are now 5% lower than a year ago, while retail sales this year are 3% lower than in the same period of 1948." There are also indications that the cost of building new factories and purchasing new equipment will decrease sharply in the second half of this year, possibly by 100 million yuan less than in the second half of last year. The paper continued: "In addition to the expected slump in enterprises, exports are also likely to decline continuously."

    美国的经济
    可能长期萧条
    英金融时报评论说
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：金融时报（属于卡姆罗斯集团，在银行界颇有影响）论美国经济形势称：现在有人谈论着长期萧条的可能，这个萧条已经达到颇大的程度了。该报指出：美国的批发价格现在比较一年前跌了百分之五，同时今年的零售量比一九四八年同期减少了百分之三。还有一些迹象，说明建设新厂和购置新设备的费用在今年后半年中将急剧减少，可能比去年下半年减少一亿元。该报继称：除了企业上预料的暴跌外，很可能出口也将不断地下降。
