Jizhong Electric News: The "Beiping Yumin Local Products Depot," established through consultation between the Pingxi Special Commissioner's Office and the Beiping Trade Company, specializes in purchasing local products from farmers and supplying farmers with daily necessities. This aims to facilitate material exchange between the two regions and support exports. The Beiping Local Products Depot has already transported a portion of farmers' necessities to the Pingxi Local Products Depot to meet the needs of Pingxi farmers selling local products. In addition, the original Mentougou Chengzi Railway Station Yumin Local Products Transfer Depot has been merged into the Beiping Yumin Local Products Depot as a branch. When farmers in the Wanping area sell their local products, they can hand them over to the Chengzi branch depot, which will then transfer them to Beiping. At the same time, farmers can purchase daily necessities from Beiping and hand them over to the Beiping Yumin Local Products Depot, which will be responsible for transporting them to the Chengzi Local Products Depot. This is both convenient and reliable, further strengthening the relationship between urban and rural areas. In the future, with the support of state-owned trading companies and the People's Government, the sales of local products from Pingxi will be greatly facilitated. It is noted that in most areas of Pingxi, Wanping, Laishui, Fangshan, Liangxiang, and other counties, farmers rely on local products to sustain their livelihoods throughout the year. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, walnuts, almonds, and other products from this area were sold in major commercial ports such as Tianjin and Hong Kong, with some being exported. However, at that time, merchants heavily exploited the sales process. After the Japanese invaders occupied the area, many fruit trees were cut down, and sales stagnated due to division and blockade. This spring, the Pingxi People's Government actively called on and organized the masses to restore and cultivate forests. In Fangshan County alone, 861,571 fruit trees were planted. Among them, 91 villages cultivated 142.8 mu of fruit tree nurseries.

    平西、平市组运销机构
    用山货交换工业品
    【冀中电】平西专署与北平贸易公司协商成立的“北平裕民山货栈”专为收购当地农民的山货生产品，供给农民的日常必需品，沟通两地物资交流，扶持出口，现北平山货栈已运去平西山货栈一部农民必需品，以供出售山货的平西农民的需要。另外，原门头沟城子车站裕民山货转运栈，已并入北平裕民山货栈作为分栈。宛平一带农民推销山货时，交给城子分栈，再由城子分栈转运北平。同时农民由北平买的日用必需品交于北平裕民山货栈即负责运到城子山货栈。这样既省事，又稳妥，使城乡关系，更加密切。今后平西山货，在国营贸易公司与人民政府的扶植下，销路当大为畅通。按平西宛平、涞水、房山、良乡等县大部地区，农民多依山货维持全年生活。抗日战争前该地之核桃仁、大杏仁等，销畅国内天津、香港各大商埠，并有一部出口，但当时在推销中商人的中间剥削很重。日寇统治该区后，果树多被砍伐，且因分割封锁，销路停滞。今春平西人民政府积极号召与组织群众恢复与栽培林木，仅房山一县就栽培了果木树八十六万一千五百七十一棵。其中九十一个村共培植果木苗圃一百四十二亩八。
