    Tianjin Municipal Cooperative
    Members Nearly 60,000
    Some Cooperative Directions Do Not Correspond, Swift Transformation Needed
    [Tianjin Dispatch] Citizen consumer cooperatives in various districts and streets of Tianjin continue to be established. Since the start of establishment in mid-February, as of April 15th, a total of sixty-one have registered with the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, absorbing 59,996 members with shares totaling RMB 2,508,905. Most of these cooperatives have started operations, supplying citizens with relatively inexpensive food and daily necessities. Some of them, due to the importance attached by the economic sections of the district governments, have done a relatively good job in terms of organizational steps, leadership composition, and business operations, and have therefore won the support of their members. However, some of these cooperatives still have serious shortcomings: some districts are not focusing on establishing cooperatives with emphasis, but are instead "blooming" everywhere, thus dispersing leadership strength and making it difficult to fully mobilize the masses. For example, in the Third District, due to the lack of strong leadership, the six street cooperatives established are not much different from stores. They use profit sharing as a selling point, which fundamentally violates the cooperative's charter. Some districts lack thorough publicity and education, and the selection of cadres is not careful enough. According to statistics from 258 committee members of 42 cooperatives, only 117 are workers, working people, and suburban farmers, accounting for only 45% of the total. Furthermore, individual saboteurs have infiltrated the cooperatives, taking the opportunity to manipulate them and trying to use the name of the cooperative to make a fortune. In addition, some cooperatives have divorced themselves from the leadership of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in their business operations, failing to achieve democratic management and mass operation, and as a result, they have become disguised sales outlets for speculators, causing great losses to the cooperatives. The leadership is already paying attention to solving these problems.

    天津市民合作社
    社员已近六万人
    有些社方向不对应速转变
    【天津电】津市各区街市民消费合作社仍继续建立。自二月中旬开始建社以来，截至四月十五日为止，已向供销合作总社登记的共六十一个，吸收社员五万九千九百九十六人，股金人民券二百五十万八千九百零五元。这些合作社大都开展了业务，供给了市民比较便宜的食粮和日用必需品。其中一部分由于区政府经济股的重视，在组织步骤、领导成份和业务经营方面，都作的比较好，因而得到社员的拥护与支持。但在这些合作社中，部分仍存有严重缺点：有的区不是有重点的去建社，而是普遍的“开花”，因此分散了领导力量，不易充分发动群众。如三区由于缺少强有力的领导，所建的六个街社，和商店没有多大分别。他们以分红为号召，根本违背了社章。有的区宣传教育不够深入，选拔干部不够慎重，根据四十二个社二百五十八个社务委员的统计，其中工人、劳苦市民及城郊农民才有一百一十七人，仅占全数的百分之四五。更有个别破坏分子钻入社内，趁机操纵，想利用合作社的名义发一笔财。此外，还有的社在业务上脱离总社领导，不能做到管理民主化，经营群众化，结果反成为投机商的变相代售店，使合作社受到很大的损失。这些问题，领导上已在注意解决。
