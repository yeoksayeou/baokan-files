Jinzhong Electric Dispatch: A drought resistance and emergency planting campaign has been launched throughout the Jinzhong region. On April 20th, the Yu County government issued instructions calling on the masses to actively prevent drought and carry out emergency planting. On the same day, seven county-level cadres were dispatched to various districts to provide specific guidance. The Qian Shiyao Village in the Eighth District of Pingding County, upon receiving the government's planting instructions, immediately started emergency planting the next day. Cadres and villagers carried water and irrigated the land together. Women with labor power also went to the fields to sow seeds. In two days, the more than 90 mu of land tilled on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers was mostly completed. Now, the planting of each household in the village has also begun. More than 1,100 mu of miscellaneous land in Yaotou Village in the Third District of the county has been completely sown, and now they are preparing the valley land for planting millet. Farmers in Xiaodongguan, Yuci, who adjusted their land, have achieved great results under the call of the democratic government to resist drought and plant. The village has more than 3,200 mu of both irrigated and dry land. In addition to summer crops, there are more than 2,200 mu of autumn land, of which 840 mu have been planted with sorghum, 70 mu with soybeans, and other crops such as cotton and yam. They plan to plant another 300 mu of millet. In the two days from the 7th to the 8th of this month, they planted 180 mu of dry land sorghum. In the emergency planting, the village universally and voluntarily formed small-scale work exchange and mutual aid groups. The Sun Erhuo group planted 350 mu of sorghum in two days. All 47 livestock in the village were put into the fields. Ten waterwheels began watering the land every day before dawn. On the 29th and 30th of last month, the Third District of Pingyao convened a meeting of responsible cadres and teachers from various villages in the district to discuss the issue of drought resistance and planting. It was decided to overcome the masses' idea of waiting for rain and propose specific methods such as carrying water for spot planting and planting in the shade, and it was decided to newly open and restore 10,000 mu of water channels for irrigation and restore two-thirds of abandoned wells. After the meeting, the cadres of various villages increased their confidence and returned to their villages to mobilize drought resistance and planting. On the 29th of last month, Wenshui County held a cadre meeting of more than 400 people to discuss how to complete the county's plan to plant 60,000 mu of cotton in the current drought situation, exchanged drought resistance experience, and especially studied several methods of drought resistance and cotton planting to protect seedlings, which increased everyone's confidence in overcoming drought.
