　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, New York - Organizers of the All-American Anti-North Atlantic Treaty Conference have issued invitations to hold a national anti-North Atlantic Treaty conference in Washington on May 20th and 21st. The invitations, signed by many prominent Americans, were sent to leaders of various people's, religious, labor, and social groups. The invitation exposes the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty and criticizes the American diplomats' nonsense that the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty was to "strengthen" the United Nations. The organizers pointed out in the invitation: "American men and women are deeply concerned lest the United States government take erroneous steps that may forfeit their freedom and plunge the United States into disaster. No responsibility is more urgent than for all of us to seek common ground to establish our position of demanding genuine and lasting peace."
