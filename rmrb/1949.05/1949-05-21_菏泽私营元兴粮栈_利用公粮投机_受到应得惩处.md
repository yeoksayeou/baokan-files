[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] In April, our district experienced grain price fluctuations. In order to stabilize grain prices and regulate supply and demand, the trade company generally entrusted private grain stores to sell grain at prices lower than the market price, and gave them a certain profit according to the principle of "considering both public and private interests"; however, there were still some grain merchants who did not understand the overall situation and tried every means to engage in illegal activities. When Heze started selling grain, the difference between the selling price of public grain and the market price was relatively large. The grain store brokers instructed their relatives and friends to buy it three or five times, and then resell it for profit, so that some citizens could not buy it. Because the selling price of public grain was lower than the market price, the grain store collectors often rebuked the citizens who bought grain for insufficient payment. In the case of squeezing and difficulty in rotation, the citizens knew that they were cheating, but it was still slightly cheaper than the market price, so they let it go. Other phenomena, such as insufficient measures, were also discovered. On April 10, the trade company's native products department inspected the private merchant Yuan Yu Grain Store, and found that it had privately concealed nine shi and four dou of soybeans that should have been sold when selling public grain, in an attempt to speculate for profit. At that time, grain prices were still fluctuating. The Yuan Yu Grain Store's grain transaction volume on that day was 19 shi and 4 dou, but it falsely reported that it was 26 shi and 8 dou. On the 10th, the official price was 370 yuan per dou, and the next day the official price was 390 yuan per dou, while the market price was 430 yuan. The grain store made huge profits by reselling the concealed public grain. After the trade company found out, in addition to ordering it to pay the difference, it also imposed a fine to serve as a warning to others.

　　菏泽私营元兴粮栈
  　利用公粮投机
  　受到应得惩处
    【冀鲁豫电】四月份我区曾发生粮价波动。贸易公司为平稳粮价，调剂供需，普遍委托私人粮栈以低于市场价格代售粮食，并根据“公私兼顾”原则，给予一定利润；但仍有部分粮商不明大义，千方百计的非法捣鬼。荷泽开始售粮时，公粮售价与市价差额较大，粮栈经纪人便指使其亲友三次五次的去买，转手图利，以致有的市民买不到手。因为公粮售价较市价低廉，粮栈收款人常斥购粮市民交款不足。在挤购和轮次不易的情况下，市民明知他们作弊，但还较市价稍有便宜，也就算了。其他如升斗不够等现象，也有发现。四月十日，贸易公司土产部检查了私商元与粮栈，于代售公粮时私自隐匿应旧售的豆子九石四斗，企图投机求利。是时粮价尚在波动，该元与粮栈当天的粮食成交数本为十九石四斗，但他却虚报是二十六石八斗。十日官价每斗三百七十元，次日官价每斗为三百九十元，而市价则为四百三十元。该粮栈乃以隐匿之公粮转手谋得巨利。贸易公司查出后，除令其补缴差额外，并枓以罚金，以儆效尤。
