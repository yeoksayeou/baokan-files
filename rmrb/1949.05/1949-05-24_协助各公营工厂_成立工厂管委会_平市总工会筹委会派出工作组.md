　　Assisting State-Owned Factories to Establish Factory Management Committees
    Preparatory Committee of the Ping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Dispatches Working Groups
    [Report from this newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Ping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has organized seven working groups to go to various state-owned and public factories to assist in the establishment of factory management committees. They have decided to designate one week to ten days as the period for propaganda, education, and deliberation. On the one hand, they will go deep among the workers to strengthen the education of the workers as masters of their own affairs; on the other hand, they will also strengthen the education of the factory's administrative cadres, so that each cadre understands that in order to run people's enterprises well, it is necessary to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff. For this reason, it is necessary to establish factory management committees to implement democratic management. In the process of work, it is emphasized that other work, such as adjusting wages, improving necessary institutions, and making necessary personnel changes, must be carried out around and in conjunction with this work. It is necessary to overcome the past mistakes of attending to one thing and losing sight of another, or of inverting the importance of things. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also formulated a propaganda and education outline for the reference of each working group. The working groups departed for various factories yesterday afternoon (the 23rd) and this morning.

　　协助各公营工厂　成立工厂管委会
    平市总工会筹委会派出工作组
    【本报讯】北平市总工会筹委会组织七个工作组，分赴各国营、公营工厂协助成立工厂管理委员会。他们决定一周至十天为宣传、教育、酝酿阶段，一方面深入工人，加强对工人群众主人翁的教育；同时也加强对工厂行政干部的教育，使每个干部懂得，要办好人民企业，必须发扬职工群众的积极性创造性。为此，就必须建立工厂管理委员会，实行管理民主化。在工作过程中，强调其他工作如调整工资、改良必须改良的机构、必要的人事变动等，一定要围绕和结合这一工作进行。必须克服曾经发生过的顾此失彼、轻重倒置的毛病。市总工会筹委会并拟定宣传教育大纲供各工作组参考，各工作组已于昨日（二十三日）下午和今晨出发至各工厂。
