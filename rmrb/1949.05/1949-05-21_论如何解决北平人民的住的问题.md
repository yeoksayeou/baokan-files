　　On How to Solve the Housing Problem of the People of Beiping
　　Qian Duansheng

　　It can be predicted that after we have become a socialist country, either all houses will be publicly owned, and people will use houses according to their housing needs; or everyone will have the economic ability to acquire real estate, and the state will be in a position to restrict the concentration of real estate and manage the use of houses. In the former case, the state must have strong economic power. In the latter case, everyone must have a reasonably generous labor reward. Whether it is the former or the latter, the establishment of socialism is a prerequisite. Before socialism is established, the state cannot have strong economic power, and people cannot receive generous rewards for their labor.

　　Obviously, the people of Beiping (or any Chinese city) cannot all afford to own houses, nor can they build houses themselves in the short term. Can confiscating all houses solve the housing problem of the people of Beiping? Obviously not. It is also impossible to collect houses at a price, because the state does not have the financial resources at this time. Confiscating houses violates the principles of New Democracy, because in the New Democratic stage, private property is recognized.

　　Confiscating houses not only violates the principle of recognizing private property in the New Democratic stage, but also will lead to various adverse consequences. The first adverse consequence is that no one will be willing to invest in building new houses or renovating old houses. On the one hand, the government does not have surplus financial resources to build houses, and on the other hand, private individuals are hesitant to build houses, so the number of houses will inevitably decrease day by day. The second adverse consequence of confiscation is that social order is prone to disorder, because confiscation will inevitably cause psychological anxiety among many people. Management is also required after confiscation. This management is a very heavy task. At present, when the government should concentrate its efforts on increasing production to prosper the economy, such a heavy task will hinder the government's main work. This is another adverse consequence of confiscation.

　　Since requisition and confiscation are impossible, other more effective methods must be adopted to solve the housing problem. The principle should be to ensure that everyone has a house to live in, and no one can live in too big a house. In order to ensure that everyone has a house to live in, landlords must be encouraged to rent houses to tenants. This requires a rental system. Landlords naturally enjoy renting out houses when they get rent. To prevent anyone from living in too large a house, such people must be taxed progressively heavily, with higher taxes for those with more housing. With this two-pronged approach, Beiping's houses will surely be used in a fairly reasonable manner.

　　Beiping is not lacking in houses. The main reason for the housing problem in the past was the excessively low or high rents. If it is too low, the landlord would rather leave the house empty or live alone in a large house instead of renting it out; if it is too high, many tenants will not be able to rent a house because they cannot afford the rent. Therefore, the rent must be reasonably adjusted.

　　How to adjust it? Is it in a prescribed manner, or is it up to the landlord and tenant to agree on it? This is not an easy question to answer simply. The advantage of regulations is that they can prevent extortionate high rents or denial-style low rents. However, its disadvantage is that it is not easy to consider everything thoroughly, thus causing the drawbacks of political orders being difficult to implement. Agreements inevitably lead to landlords raising prices. The most appropriate approach is best to be like this: in principle, adopt the method of agreement between the landlord and the tenant, but the result of the agreement must be reported or registered with the government. Agreements can avoid the danger of hastily enacting laws. Reporting or registration can make the landlord have some scruples and not make unreasonable demands. If the landlord dares to violate the interests of society and demands high rents, the government can naturally let organized mass groups launch public opinion to criticize this kind of hegemonic behavior. This method of combining agreement and reporting should be a method with small harms and great benefits.

　　Some people say that under the method of freely agreeing on rent, citizens with meager incomes will still have the danger of not being able to rent a house easily. This is possible. The government should give special consideration to the housing problems of this part of the people. Organizing housing cooperatives, requisitioning the spare parts of temples and converting them into housing, and ordering factories and large-scale public institutions to build dormitories are all adaptive solutions.

　　In short, to solve the housing problem in Beiping, the highest principle is to make the existing houses get the greatest and fairest use. In the current stage of social development, the most effective method is to allow landlords to get some profit and prevent them from holding on to houses and not letting people live in them.

　　论如何解决北平人民的住的问题
    钱端升
    可以预料，到了我们已经成为一个社会主义国家后，或是一切房屋均属公有，人民则视各人的住的需要而使用房屋；或是人人得有营置房产的经济能力，而国家则处于限制房产集中，并管制房屋使用的地位。如为前者，国家须有雄厚的经济力量。如为后者，人民个个须有相当优裕的劳动报酬。无论为前者或为后者，社会主义的建立均为前提。在社会主义没有建立以前，国家是不可能有雄厚的经济力量的，人民也不可能个个对于他的劳动得到优裕的报酬的。
    很显然的，北平市（或是任何一个中国都市）的人民并不能人人都置有房屋，也不可能在短期内自建房屋。将一切房屋充公能不能解决北平人民的住的问题呢？显然是不能的。将房屋给价征收亦是不可能的，因为国家此时无此财力。将房屋没收是违反了新民主主义的原则的，因为在新民主主义的阶段，私产是承认了的。
    没收房屋不但违反了新民主主义阶段承认私产的原则，而且将招致多种恶果。第一种恶果是，无人愿意投资建造新房，或翻建旧房。一方面政府没有多余的财力去建房，一方面私人又裹足不前，不去建房，房屋势将日益减少。没收的第二种恶果是社会秩序容易紊乱，因为没收势必引起众多人民心理上的不安。没收以后又须要管理。这个管理是一件十分繁重之事。在目下，政府正应集中精力于增加生产，以繁荣经济之时，这样一件繁重工作势将妨害政府的主要工作。这是没收的又一恶果。
    征收及没收工具不可能，则解决住的问题必须采用其他更有效的办法。原则应为使大家都有房屋住，而没有人可住太大的房屋。为使大家都有房屋住，必须鼓励房主将房屋出租于房客。这又必须用租金的制度。房主得了房租，自然乐于将房屋出租。为防止任何人住太大的房屋，必须课这种人以累进的重税，住房愈多者课税愈重。用这种双行的办法，北平的房屋必可得到相当合理的使用。
    北平房屋不算缺乏。过去的住房问题的所以发生，主要原因即因房租之过低或过高。过低则房主宁愿空闭房屋，或独住大宅，而不愿出租；过高则广多的房客，因付不起房租而致租不到房屋。所以房租必须有合理的调剂。
    如何调剂呢？用规定的方式呢，抑是任凭房主房客两愿协议呢？这是一个不易作简单答复的问题。规定的优点在可以防止勒索式的高额租金或抵赖式的低额租金。但其缺点则为考虑不易周到，因而招致政令窒碍难行的流弊。协议则不免发生房主高抬房价的故技。比较最妥慎的处理方法最好是这样：在原则上采取房主房客协议的方法，但协议的结果，必须向政府报告或登记。协议可以免除草率定法的危险。报告或登记则可以使房主有所顾忌，而不作不合理的要求。房主如果敢于违背社会的利益，要索高租，政府自然可以让有组织的民众团体，发动舆论，抨击这种恶霸式的行为。这种协议与报告兼采的方法，应当是害小益多的办法。
    有人说，在自由议定房租的办法下，收入微小的市民将仍有不易租获房屋的危险。这是可能的。这部分人民的住的问题政府自应特予照顾。组织房屋合作社，征用庙宇的空余部分，改作住房，责令工厂及大规模的公营机关筹建宿舍，均为适应的解决办法。
    总之，要解决北平的住的问题，最高原则乃是使现有房屋得到最大的最公平的使用。在现阶段的社会发展中，最有效的方法则是使房主得到些利润，而防止他们把持房屋不令人住。
