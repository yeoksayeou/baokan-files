    After the Assessment of Taxes in Beiping, Tax Payment Notices are Now Being Issued; Late Payment Will Result in Fines

    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The spring business tax collection in Beiping is the first time the Municipal Tax Bureau has undertaken this work. Therefore, our reporter interviewed Deputy Director Peng Tao of the bureau, who provided the following answers: Regarding the tax rate for the spring business tax, Deputy Director Peng stated, "Except for the industries eligible for reduction and exemption as stipulated in the Municipal Government Finance and Taxation Document No. 4 issued on the first of this month, all tax rates will remain provisionally calculated at 3% of revenue and 6% of profit tax." As for the method for converting the fake gold yuan notes and Renminbi for the January business tax this year, Comrade Peng Tao said: "In principle, the conversion of fake gold yuan notes to Renminbi in January will still be based on the number of millet that could be purchased at the time, and then paid at the market price. However, in order to take into account the business situation of various businesses in the city this spring, it is specially allowed to convert at a rate of one to one. The exchange rate for the fake gold yuan notes in February has already been announced, and will be converted at an exchange rate of ten to one." Deputy Director Peng also talked about the deadline for paying business tax: "Currently, the work of tax assessment has been completed, and the tax amounts are being reviewed and tax payment notices are being issued. Taxpayers must pay the tax at the designated bank within the deadline (five days). Those who pay within ten days after the deadline will be fined 20% of the tax payable; those who pay within twenty days will be fined 40% of the tax payable; those who pay within one month will be fined 60% of the tax payable. Those who still fail to pay after one month will have their tax amount converted to the equivalent number of millet, and the tax amount will be calculated based on the market price of millet on the payment date, and a double penalty will be imposed."

    Finally, Deputy Director Peng Tao stated: "This is the first time that business tax is being collected in the city. The time is short, and the investigation and understanding of business households is not thorough enough, and there may be omissions. Even if the spring business tax collection is completed, if it is later discovered that there are false declarations or unreported 'black households' who have not voluntarily corrected or supplemented their declarations, they will still be investigated according to law. Therefore, it is hoped that the business community in the city will supervise each other and assist in reporting, in order to achieve the task of fair and reasonable tax burden and increased tax revenue."

    平市评议税额完成后
    现正填发缴款书
    逾期不缴者将课以罚款
    【本报专访】平市税务局开征之春季营业税工作，尚属初次。为此记者特访问该局彭涛副局长，承解答如下：关于春季营业税之税率规定，彭副局长称：“税率一项除本月一日市府财税字第四号布告规定，准于减免的业别外，一律仍暂按收入额百分之三、收益税百分之六计税”。至于本年度元月份营业税之伪金元券与人民券之折合比率办法、彭涛同志谈：元月份伪金元券换算人民币，原则上仍按当时折购小米数目，再按市价缴纳。惟为照顾本市各商本年春季营业情况，特准改按一比一换算。二月份伪金元券已有公布比价，依十比一的兑换率换算。彭副局长并谈到缴纳营业税期限问题：“目前评议税额的工作已完成，正复核税额，填发缴款书，务须于限期（五日）以内，至指定银行缴款，逾期十日以内者加罚应纳税款二成；二十日以内者，加罚应纳税额四成；一个月以内者加罚应纳税额六成。一个月以上仍延不缴纳者，按应纳税额折合小米数目，以缴款日之小米市价折计税额，加倍处罚。”
    最后，彭涛副局长表示：此次在本市初次开征营业税，时间短促，对于商户调查了解工作不够彻底，且恐有所遗漏，春季营业税即使征收完毕，俟后如再发现有申报不实及漏报黑户，而未自行改报或补报者，仍依法追究。因此希本市商民互相监督，协助检举，以期达到税额负担公平合理增加税收的任务。（建）
