    After the victory of the October Revolution in 1917, the working class of the Soviet Union became the ruling class. Its most difficult task was to lead all working people onto the road of new economic construction and to establish new labor discipline and new labor organizations. At that time, it had no experience in economic construction and management, and everything had to start from scratch, building and learning at the same time.
    The Soviet Communist Party carried out tremendous educational work among the working class, making the working class a model of observing socialist labor discipline and a model of recognizing the tasks of socialist construction among all working people. In this arduous educational work, the party's most important and reliable helper was the trade union.
    When Lenin pointed out the most important characteristics of the trade union, he emphasized that the trade union is "an educational organization, a guiding organization, a training organization, a school, a school of management, a school of business, and a school of communism." Stalin pointed out: The trade union is "a primary and fundamental belt driving the machine, a primary and fundamental transmission machine, with its help, the Party has established contact with the working class."
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin taught that trade unions should frequently contact the masses from all aspects, carefully listen to the voices of the masses, understand the demands of the masses, and not only educate the masses but also learn from the masses. Lenin said: "Contacting the masses, that is, contacting the vast majority of workers, is the most important and fundamental condition for the success of any undertaking by the trade union."
    The basic method of trade union activities is the method of persuasion. If the method of persuasion is not used, the activities of workers' organizations will not work.
    The resolution of the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the trade union movement stipulates the guiding principles for all activities of the trade union: "The trade union is equal to a communist school, and should discuss the various daily lives of the working masses, and at the same time gradually attract the vast laboring classes into the cause of national construction, and constantly use our program opinions to guide their way forward, gradually raising them from selfishness to public, and gradually raising them from non-party and non-factional to communism."
    Members of Soviet trade unions frequently participate in staff meetings of all enterprises and workshops, and attend production meetings. When the factory committee of the trade union and the factory sign a collective contract, workers and staff generally participate in the discussion of the draft contract. These activities have greatly cultivated and developed the working class's sense of responsibility for production and the sense of being masters of the country.
    The most important task of the trade union is to cultivate the working class's communist labor attitude and universally develop the socialist emulation movement. At first, there was the Communist Saturday voluntary labor movement, and there were shock teams, shock workshops, until the Stakhanov movement. Now socialist emulation is striving to complete the five-year plan in four years.
    Soviet trade unions participate in the management of the country. According to the Stalin Constitution, trade unions have the right to nominate their own candidates for Soviet representatives. At the same time, trade unions also supervise state organs in the form of social supervision.
    Soviet trade unions are very concerned about the lives of their members and their families. Assistance is given to members in cases of life, disability, loss of working ability and other similar circumstances. Trade unions own a large number of their own sanatoriums, health resorts and hospitals.
    Cultural palaces, clubs, red entertainment rooms, libraries, newspapers, theaters, sports fields, etc. of trade unions are densely distributed throughout the Soviet Union, and the purpose of all its activities is to improve the political and cultural level of the working people, explain the party's policies, closely unite the masses, and strive for the victory of communist construction.
    The Soviet trade union educates the working class in the spirit of internationalism, making the Soviet working class the vanguard of the world working class, fighting against war instigators, striving for the unity of the world working-class movement, and striving for lasting peace and people's democracy.

    苏联的职工会
    一九一七年十月革命胜利以后，苏联的工人阶级成为当权的阶级了，它最困难的任务，是要领导一切劳动人民走上新的经济建设的道路，建立新的劳动纪律和新的劳动组织。当时，它还没有经济建设的经验和管理经验，必须一切从头作起，一面建设一面学习。
    苏联共产党对工人阶级进行了巨大的教育工作，使工人阶级在全体劳动人民中成为遵守社会主义劳动纪律的模范，成为认清社会主义建设任务的模范。在这个繁巨的教育工作中，党的最主要的最可靠的助手就是职工会。
    列宁指出职工会最重要的特点时，强调指出职工会是“教育的组织、诱导的组织、训练的组织，是一所学校、管理的学校、经营的学校、共产主义的学校。”斯大林则指出：职工会是“一条首要的根本的带动机器的皮带，一个首要的根本的传达机器，在它的帮助下，党同工人阶级取得了联系。”
    联共党、列宁、斯大林教导说：职工会应经常从各方面联系群众，细心倾听群众的呼声，了解群众的要求，不仅要教育群众，还要向群众学习。列宁说：“联系群众，即联系绝大多数的工人，这就是职工会做成功任何一项事业的最重要根本的条件。”
    职工会活动的基本方法，是说服的方法。如果不用说服方法，工人组织的活动是行不通的。
    联共党第十次代表大会对职工运动的决议，规定了职工会一切活动的领导原则：“职工会等于一所共产主义学校，应当讨论劳动群众的各种日常生活，同时把各广大劳动阶层逐渐吸引到国家建设事业中来，经常用我们纲领上的意见来指引他们的前进道路，把他们从自私的引导到公共的，渐渐把他们从无党无派提高到共产主义。”
    苏联职工会会员经常参加一切企业、车间的工作人员会议，出席生产会议。当职工会的工厂委员会和厂方签订集体合同时，工人和职员都普遍参加讨论合同的草案。这些活动大大地培养并发展了工人阶级对生产的责任感和国家主人翁的感觉。
    职工会最重要的任务是培养工人阶级共产主义的劳动态度，普遍发展社会主义竞赛运动。起初有共产主义星期六义务劳动运动，有突击班、突击车间、直到斯塔哈诺夫运动。现在社会主义竞赛正向四年完成五年计划努力。
    苏联职工会参加着管理国家的工作。根据斯大林宪法，职工会有权提出自己的苏维埃代表候选人。同时，职工会也以社会监督的方式监督国家机关。
    苏联职工会十分关心会员及其家庭的生活。在会员生活、残废、失去工作能力及其他类似的情形下，给予他们以帮助。职工会拥有大量自己的休养所、疗养所和医院。
    苏联全国各地都密布着职工会的文化宫、俱乐部、红色娱乐室、图书馆、报纸、剧院、运动场等，其一切活动的目的，都是提高劳动人民的政治水平和文化水平，解释党的政策，紧密团结群众、争取共产主义建设的胜利。
    苏联职工会以国际主义的精神教育工人阶级，使苏联工人阶级成为世界工人阶级的先锋，为反对战争挑拨者，争取世界工人运动的统一，争取持久和平与人民民主而斗争。    （新华社）
