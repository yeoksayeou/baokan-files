    Sixth Day of the National Youth Congress
    Liu Shanben Reports
    Calling on Chinese Youth to Participate in Air Force Construction
    Heroic Models Report on Struggle Deeds
    The Chinese People's Air Force is Growing Continuously
    Chinese Youth are Highly Valued Internationally.

    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 9th) was the sixth day of the All-China Youth Congress, and the conference continued with speeches. Delegates listened to reports from eleven representatives with great excitement. The venue was filled with patriotic spirit and heroic spirit, and the delegates expressed their inner joy and respect with bursts of applause.

    As soon as Liu Shanben, the representative of the Air Force, stepped in front of the loudspeaker, the audience immediately applauded enthusiastically. This was not only because he was the initiator of the uprising of the Kuomintang Air Force, but also showed that the Chinese people already had their own air force. In recent years, due to the righteous appeal of the Chinese Communist Party and the promotion of the victorious revolutionary situation, following Liu Shanben, Kuomintang aircraft have continuously broken through the Kuomintang's strict blockade and surveillance, and moved from darkness to light. The People's Liberation Army has also captured a large number of aircraft on various battlefields. He told everyone in a high-pitched voice that the Chinese People's Air Force, from nothing to something, from small to large, is constantly growing. Comrade Liu Shanben called on Chinese youth to participate in the construction of the air force, to build a strong people's air force, and to consolidate the victory of the revolution.

    Liu Zengyi, a model worker in the Bethune Model Field Hospital, reported on the spirit of self-sacrifice and heroic deeds of female comrades in field hospitals across the country. She introduced several female medical workers who attended the conference, such as Yin Hui and Gao Lanying, who insisted on transfusing blood for the wounded regardless of their own health, Wang Qinying, who used her body to cover the wounded during enemy bombing, and Wang Zhonghui, who helped the wounded carry luggage during marches and did recreational work for the troops during rest. When the introduced individuals stood up to meet the representatives, everyone applauded loudly to pay their respects.

    Tian Changqing, the representative of the YMCA, and Gao Renying, the representative of the YWCA, reported on the YMCA and YWCA's work in serving society. They also called on all YMCA members to strive to build a new democratic country and strive for lasting world peace in order to realize true freedom, equality, and fraternity for mankind.

    Bai Entao, the representative of the Hui people, pointed out that under the leadership of the Communist Party, Hui men and women have turned themselves over in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture.

    Fan Xuehua, a seventeen-year-old female youth from East China, reported on how she mobilized women in the entire village to learn how to cultivate the land.

    Wang Shigu, the representative of the Peking Student Union, reported that Peking students have shifted to studying and assisting the People's Government in building a new Peking after liberation.

    Yang Wenbing, a model primary school teacher in the Taiyue District of North China, Lü Wen, a student representative from Sichuan, and Lin Sanliang, a Gaoshan ethnic representative from Taiwan, a PLA soldier who has been awarded three major merits, also gave reports.

    The representatives listened with great attention and interest to Comrade Song Ping's report on the Soviet Union's youth after attending the 11th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League. He first introduced the achievements of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League in the war and construction, and then pointed out: Chinese youth, who have made brilliant contributions to the liberation of the motherland, are highly valued internationally. He reported that the Soviet people are working hard under the leadership of Stalin to build and begin to move towards a communist society. Young people and children can greatly improve their learning ability because they can get full convenience in the learning environment, young scientists are constantly emerging, and Michurin research groups have been widely established in children's palaces. Comrade Song Ping pointed out that Soviet youth are now taking loving the motherland, loving labor, not being afraid of difficulties, studying diligently and deeply, and implementing the spirit of internationalism as the highest qualities of youth. He finally emphasized: The Chinese people must learn from the Soviet Union to build their own country. The representatives looked at the huge statue of Mao Zedong on the stage with infinite excitement, and they saw a bright prospect for the new China.
