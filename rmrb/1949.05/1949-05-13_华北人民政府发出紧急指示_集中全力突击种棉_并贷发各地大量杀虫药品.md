    North China People's Government Issues Emergency Instructions:
    Concentrate All Efforts on Crash Planting Cotton
    And Issue Large Quantities of Insecticides to Various Regions on Credit

    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government recently issued emergency instructions to the administrative offices of various provinces regarding crash planting of cotton, stating: Considerable achievements have been made in drought resistance and planting in various regions; however, there are only ten-odd days left in the cotton planting season. If we do not seize the opportunity to organize and mobilize, it will affect the entire economic construction plan. Therefore, cotton-producing areas should immediately launch a cotton planting crash week, suspend all non-urgent tasks, mobilize all forces, and use all means to complete the cotton planting task. Regions that have received rainfall should strive to exceed the original plan. In order to increase the enthusiasm of the masses for cotton planting, the price of planting long-staple, large-boll cotton can be increased to eight to ten catties of rice for each catty of cotton when converting to public grain, based on the quality.

    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to control pests and diseases affecting crops and cotton in various regions, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has taken over agricultural medicines in Beiping and Tianjin, including mole cricket solution, mole cricket medicine, D-Dust, calcium arsenate, lead arsenate, mercuric chloride, Bordeaux mixture, DDT, Ceresan, etc., totaling 93,775 catties, and nicotine sulfate, sodium fluosilicate, etc., totaling 6,045 pounds, with a total price equivalent to 790,000 catties of rice. These have now been lent to Jidong, Jizhong, Jinan, Jiluyu, Chahar Province, Taihang, Taiyue, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Ping, and Tianjin for farmers to use, with repayment to be collected in the fall. Currently, Jidong and Chahar Province have taken all of their allocated supplies, and other regions are distributing them in batches.

    华北人民政府发出紧急指示
    集中全力突击种棉
    并贷发各地大量杀虫药品
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷对各省行署发出突击种棉的紧急指示，内称：各地抗旱点种已获不少成绩；但棉花下种期只剩十余日，若不再抓紧组织动员，势将影响全部经济建设计划。因此产棉区应即开展植棉突击周，暂停一切不急的任务，动员一切力量，用一切办法完成植棉任务。已经落雨地区，应争取超过原来计划。为了提高群众的种棉积极性，种植长绒大花，可按质量好坏提高到每斤棉花折交公粮米八斤至十斤。
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部为扑灭各地农作物和棉花等的病虫害，特将在北平、天津接收之农业药品，计有蝼蛄药水，蝼蛄药，地力斯粉，砒酸钙，砒酸铅，龙汞、波尔多，ＤＤＴ，赛力散等共九万三千七百七十五斤，和硫酸烟精，氟＠酸纳等共六千四十五磅，总计按价格折米七十九万斤。现已分别贷发到冀东、冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫、察省、太行、太岳、太原、石家庄、平、津等地供农民使用，待秋后将款收回，目前冀东、察省已全部取去，其他各区正分批领发中。
