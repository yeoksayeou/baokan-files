Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: The third rotation strike of 450,000 Japanese miners was held as scheduled on the 14th and 16th (the 15th was Sunday and not counted). The miners, disregarding the obstructionist actions of MacArthur and representatives of the Japanese government, insisted on demanding increased wages and refused to compromise in any way. In this strike, the miners' union changed the phased rotation method to a nationwide simultaneous 48-hour general strike. According to a union spokesperson, after the third strike ended at midnight on the 16th, they plan to hold another rotation strike. It is estimated that the Japanese coal production loss due to the three rotation strikes of the miners will reach more than 400,000 tons.

According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Labor on the 13th, the organized strength of Japanese labor is continuing to develop. As of the end of March, there were 36,482 trade union organizations with more than 6.9 million members. Before the war, Japan only had more than 900 trade unions with 420,000 members.

　　改轮回制为同时大罢工
  　日矿工罢工两日
    劳工省承认工会力量强大
    【新华社北平十八日电】东京消息：日本四十五万矿工的第三次轮回罢工，于十四、十六两日（十五日为星期日，不计在内），如期举行。矿工们不顾麦克阿瑟及日本政府代表的阻挠行为，坚持要求增加工资，拒绝作任何妥协。在这次罢工中，矿工工会已将分期轮回的办法，改为全国同时举行四十八小时大罢工。据工会发言人称：在第三次罢工于十六日午夜结束后，他们将计划接着举行另一次轮回罢工。据估计，在矿工三次轮回罢工的打击下，日本煤产的损失将达四十余万吨。
    另据日劳工省十三日公布的统计，日本劳动有组织的力量正继续发展。截至三月底止，工会组织共达三万六千四百八十二个，拥有会员六百九十余万人。按日本战前仅有工会九百余个，会员四十二万人。
