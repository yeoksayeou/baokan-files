Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd. After the liberation of Pingjin, the old reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in various schools has been overthrown, and students have gained political freedom and liberation, and have begun to accept new education; however, on the other hand, a lax and undisciplined phenomenon has emerged in many private schools and some public schools, which seriously hinders academic progress. Many students mistakenly believe that the old curriculum and system are all undesirable, and hope to replace them with a new set all at once, but they do not understand enough about how to seize every opportunity to strengthen their studies so that they can quickly cultivate themselves into talents for building a new China. Therefore, how to gradually eliminate the remnants of past feudal and fascist shackles, while strengthening students' understanding of learning, researching and establishing a new, truly democratic school spirit and discipline, and opposing ultra-democracy and anarchist tendencies, is a problem that educational leading organs, youth work groups, and school teachers and students must quickly solve together. The Tianjin Private Hedong Middle School has reviewed this issue and formulated preliminary solutions for reference. After the liberation of Tianjin, many students at Hedong Middle School believed that now that they were liberated, they no longer had to be bound by any school rules or discipline. They arbitrarily arrived late and left early for class, and entered and exited freely. Some individual students even believed that attending class was "supporting the teacher." They did not cherish school property, and incidents of damaging school equipment occurred frequently. Some faculty and staff members, because they had been too strict with students in the past, were afraid of student retaliation and adopted a laissez-faire attitude. Although the general faculty and staff were dissatisfied with this phenomenon, they had no way to improve it. As a result, teachers were not at ease teaching, students' studies suffered, and parents became dissatisfied with the school. In order to overcome the above-mentioned phenomena, the school successively held meetings of all teachers and students and joint meetings of representatives of various classes, societies, and faculty and staff to review the reasons for the occurrence of this phenomenon. The main reasons were: (1) Faculty and staff members did not have a clear understanding of serving the people and cultivating new citizens for the new society in their educational positions, and their sense of responsibility was not strong enough. They knew that many old things were unreasonable and needed to be reformed, but they lacked specific analysis and research, and could not replace the old methods with new ones, forming a lack of direction in leadership or even abandoning leadership. (2) Some students do not understand that the main task of students after liberation is to study, and all behaviors that hinder learning should be opposed. (3) They negate everything of the old subjects without analysis, thinking that natural sciences are not needed, and even mistakenly believe that the People's Government only pays attention to politics and not to culture and education. (4) Students are dissatisfied with individual teachers who have suppressed them in the past, and therefore improperly adopt a passive resistance attitude of not attending classes. (5) Some students suffer from acute impatience, not considering objective difficulties, and hoping for a thorough educational reform immediately, and then studying hard. The meeting decided on the following ways to overcome these issues: (1) Establish a new school spirit and discipline based on the New Democratic education policy, establish correct relationships between students and faculty and staff, and students and student unions, promote respect for teachers and love for students, and call on everyone to unite and run the school well. (2) Carry out criticism and self-criticism, establish a regular learning system, and formulate necessary covenants. (3) Teachers should also strengthen their studies. Organize teachers' study groups to constantly improve themselves. (4) Teacher-student meetings should be held frequently to exchange opinions and jointly improve teaching methods.

　　平津部分公私立学校中产生散漫无纪律现象
    现已开始注意纠正
    【新华社北平三日电】平津解放后，各学校旧有的国民党反动统治已被推翻，学生得到了政治上的自由解放，开始接受新教育；但另一方面，有不少私立学校与部分公立学校中却产生一种散漫无纪律现象，严重妨碍了学业。不少学生误以为旧有的课程和制度都要不得，希望一下都改换为新的一套，而对于如何不放松一切机会加强学习，使自己能迅速培养成建设新中国的人材这一点，却了解不足。因此，如何一方面逐步肃清过去封建主义与法西斯主义的束缚的残余，一方面又加强学生对学习的认识，研究与建立新真正民主主义的新的校风与校纪，反对极端民主化与无政府主义倾向，是教育领导机关、青年工作团体与学校师生必须迅速共同解决的问题。天津私立河东中学对此问题，已作检讨。并定出初步的解决办法，可供参考。河东中学在天津解放后，有不少学生以为现在解放了，可以不再受任何校规和纪律的约束，上课时，任意迟到早退，自由出入，甚至有个别学生认为上课是对教员“捧场”。对学校公物也不加爱惜，毁坏校具的事情，时常发生，有的教职员因为过去对学生管制太严，怕学生报复，一切采取放任态度。一般教职员虽然对这种现象不满，但苦无改进办法。因而教员不安心教课，学生的学业受到损失，并引起家长们对学校不满。为克服上述现象，该校先后召开了全体师生会议及各班级、社团、教职员代表联席会议，检讨出这种现象发生的原因，主要是：（一）教职员对站在教育岗位上为人民服务培养新社会的新公民的认识不够明确，责任心不够强，他们知道旧的东西有很多不合理，需要加以必要的改革，但又缺乏具体的分析研究，不能用新的办法代替旧的办法，形成领导无一定方针甚至放弃领导。（二）部分学生不了解解放后学生的主要任务就是学习，一切妨碍学习的行为都应当反对。（三）对旧有科目不加分析地否定一切，认为自然科学都不需要学了，甚至误认为人民政府只重视政治，不注意文化教育。（四）学生对于过去曾经压制过他们的个别教员不满，因而不适当地采取了不去上课的消极抵抗态度。（五）一部分学生犯急性病，不考虑客观困难，希望立即来一个彻底的教育改革，然后再好好地学习。会议决定了克服的办法：（一）根据新民主主义教育方针，建立新的校风校纪，建立学生与教职员、学生与学生会的正确关系，提倡尊师爱生，号召大家团结，办好学校。（二）开展批评与自我批评，建立正规的学习制度，订立必要的公约。（三）教员亦应加强学习。组织教员学习会，不断提高自己。（四）应经常召开师生会议，相互交换意见，共同改进教学方法。
