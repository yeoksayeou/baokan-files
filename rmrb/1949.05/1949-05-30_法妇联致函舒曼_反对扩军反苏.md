　　French Women's Federation Sends Letter to Schuman
  　Opposing Military Expansion and Anti-Sovietism
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th - The Polish News Agency reported: The French Women's Federation stated in a letter to Foreign Minister Schuman: We French mothers hope that you will listen to our opinions, because war is a terrible thing for us. As soon as you returned from the United States, you said that we must make great efforts to reorganize our armaments in order to fulfill the obligations undertaken in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty. In order to achieve peace, a cleansed of Nazis and democratic Germany must be established. French mothers will never allow their sons to participate in wars against the Soviet Union or any other countries that love independence, freedom, and peace. You must keep this in mind when considering such an important international conference.

　　法妇联致函舒曼
  　反对扩军反苏
    【新华社北平二十八日电】波兰通讯社报道：法国妇女联盟在致外长舒曼函中称：我们法国母亲们希望你倾听我们的意见，因为战争对我们是一个可怕的事情。你一从美国回来，就说我们必须作很大的努力重整军备，为履行依照北大西洋公约所担承的义务。为了获致和平，必须建立一个肃清了纳粹的和民主的德国。法国母亲们决不允许他们的儿子参加反对苏联或其他任何爱好独立、自由与和平的国家的战争。在考虑这样一个重要的国际会议时，你必须想到这一点。
