To eliminate the accumulated malpractices of various entrusted consignment shops, the Ping City Trade Company's Grain Branch, based on citizen feedback, continued to conduct inspections and cleanups. As of the 16th, seven consignment shops, including Qian Ju Hou, were found to have engaged in fraudulent activities. In addition to immediately revoking their processing and consignment qualifications, they were dealt with according to the severity of their offenses. The facts of the seven consignment shops' malfeasance are as follows: Qian Ju Hou in Inner District 6: Stole 17,189 catties of corn and falsely reported selling 12,000 catties of corn flour. This private merchant also engaged in speculative trading in the grain market.
