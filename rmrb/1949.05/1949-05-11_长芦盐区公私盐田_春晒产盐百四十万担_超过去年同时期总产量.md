    Changlu Salt District Public and Private Salt Fields
    Achieve 1.4 Million Dan of Salt Production in Spring Season
    Exceeding Last Year's Total Output for the Same Period
    [Tianjin Electric] Since the full commencement of spring salt production in the Dagu, Tanggu, Xinhe, and Denggu salt fields of the Changlu Salt District, salt production has surged. The 283 public and private salt fields (including 98 civilian fields) produced a total of 1,487,156 dan of salt (100 jin per dan) from the start of spring production at the end of March to April 30th, exceeding the total output for the same period last year. The 146 public-owned fields in Dagu produced 779,140 dan in April, an increase of nearly threefold compared to the 267,100 dan in April of last year. The 39 civilian-owned fields in Tanggu produced a total of 154,602 dan from the beginning of spring production to the end of April, an increase of more than fourfold compared to the 35,995 dan in the same period last year. The increase in production is mainly due to the increased political awareness of the salt field workers, which has changed their work attitude and motivated them to produce actively. The Dagu public-owned salt fields have been paying wages on time and have decided to adopt a bonus system for exceeding quotas, which has further boosted the workers' enthusiasm for production. The workers have spontaneously launched a production competition, striving to be model workers.

    长芦盐区公私盐田
    春晒产盐百四十万担
    超过去年同时期总产量
    【天津电】长芦盐区的大沽、塘沽、新河、邓沽四处盐田，全面春晒以后，盐产激增。公私盐田二百八十三付（内民滩九十八付），自三月底春晒开始后，至四月三十日为止，共产盐一百四十八万七千一百五十六担（每担一百斤），超过了去年同时期的总产量。大沽公营滩一百四十六付，四月份产七十七万九千一百四十担，较去年四月二十六万七千一百担，增加了将及两倍。塘沽民滩三十九付，从春晒开始到四月底共产十五万四千六百零二担，较去年同时期的三万五千九百九十五担，增加了三倍以上。产量增加的原因，主要由于盐滩工人政治觉悟提高，改变了劳动态度，积极生产。大沽公营盐田按时发放工资，并决定采用超额分红制度，更提高了工人生产情绪，工人们自动发起了生产竞赛，争着作模范。
