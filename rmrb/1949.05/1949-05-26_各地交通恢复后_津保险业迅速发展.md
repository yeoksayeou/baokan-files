　　Following the restoration of transportation to and from Tianjin and the rapid recovery of industry and commerce, the business of the China Property Insurance Company has developed quite rapidly. Since the company was placed under the direct leadership of the Savings Department of the People's Bank, it has experienced significant development due to the strengthening of its organization and the increase in capital. Since it started operations on April 4th, it underwrote 109 fire insurance policies by the end of April, with a total insured amount of 276 million yuan. In addition to underwriting independently, it also received 170 policies from other companies through reinsurance. From May 1st to the 20th, within 20 days, it underwrote 135 fire insurance policies, 4 water insurance policies, and 3 transportation insurance policies, with a total insured amount of over 326 million yuan. The number of policies and the insured amount have both exceeded the previous month. Currently, all goods transported by rail from Tianjin to Beijing, Tangshan, Tanggu, Shanhaiguan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Zhangjiakou can be insured with railway safe transportation insurance. Goods transported by water to Tanggu, Dagukou, Qinhuangdao, Huludao, Dalian, Yantai, and Yingkou can be insured with marine safe transportation insurance. In addition to domestic transportation insurance, small-sum transportation insurance to Hong Kong can also be underwritten. Among the fire insurance policies underwritten, a large number covered export goods stored in docks and dock warehouses, such as bristles, horsetail, mountain products, and carpets, ensuring the safe export of these goods. Furthermore, the company's cooperation with the Savings Department's warehouse business since it came under the department's leadership has provided great convenience to customers. In order to further expand the scope of insurance, the company has established contact with the Northeast Insurance Company in Shenyang, and reinsurance can be carried out in the future, so that large amounts of water insurance, fire insurance, and transportation insurance can be jointly underwritten in the future.
    [Another News] In addition to the seven insurance companies in Tianjin, namely, Taiping, Taianfeng, Ping An, Great Wall, Baolong, Zhaotai, and Zhong'an, which are operating jointly, the following seven companies have also resumed operations: Min'an, Bohai, Dachang, Tongji, China, Yongning, and Hezong.

    【天津讯】天津对外交通的逐渐畅通和工商业迅速恢复后，中国产物保险公司业务发展颇为迅速。该公司于划归人民银行储蓄部直接领导后，因为机构加强，资金增多，业务更有显著发展。从四月四日开始营业以来，到四月底共承保火险一百零九笔，承保额为二亿七千六百万元。除本身单独承保外，还分由同业分入承保的有一百七十笔。从五月一日到二十日二十天内，即承保火险一百三十五笔，水险四笔及运输险三笔，承保额三亿二千六百余元。其笔数与承保额，均已超过上月份。现凡自津由铁路运往北平、唐山、塘沽、山海关、保定、石家庄、张家口的货物，均可承保铁路平安运输险。由水路运往塘沽、大沽口、秦皇岛、葫芦岛、大连、烟台、营口的货物，均可承保水运平安保险。除了内地运输险以外，也可以承保运往香港的小额运输险。在承保火险中，承保了大批存放码头及码头仓库的出口货物，如猪鬃、马尾、山货、地毯，保障了出口货物的安全输出。又该公司受储蓄部领导后，与该部的仓库业务配合起来，也给予顾客以很大的便利。为了继续扩大保险范围，该公司已与沈阳东北保险公司取得连系，以后可以进行分保，这样将来大额的水险、火险、运输险均可以联合承保。
