Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 7th: Fierce competition is taking place between the shipping industries of Britain and the Netherlands, so-called partners in European "economic cooperation." Dutch shipping companies are striving to drive out British competitors from cargo transportation from East Asian countries, especially India, to Europe, and have already reduced freight rates by 8 percent. In addition, five Dutch ships carrying goods to Southeast Asian countries at lower freight rates have sailed to British ports. Dutch companies are also demanding the right to carry 60 percent of all cargo transported from Northern Europe to Asia. Britain is firmly opposed to this. The Dutch Communist Party newspaper *De Waarheid* wrote on this matter: "The competition between British and Dutch companies is becoming increasingly tense. This vividly illustrates another aspect of the so-called cooperation of capitalist countries, which is the desire to defeat the cooperating party."

    英荷航业竞争猛烈
    都想打垮对方
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社海牙讯：所谓欧洲“经济合作”中的伙伴英国与荷兰两国的航业之间，正进行猛烈竞争。荷兰轮船公司力图从由东亚国家特别是由印度到欧洲的货运中赶走英国竞争者，已将运费减低百分之八。此外，以较低运费运载货物至东南亚国家的五艘荷兰船只，已驶往英国港口。荷兰公司并要求有权载运由北欧运往亚洲的全部货运的百分之六十。英国对此坚决反对。荷共真理报就此事写道：“英国与荷兰公司之间的竞争愈来愈紧张。这生动地说明了所谓资本主义国家合作的另一面，是想要打垮合作的对方。”
