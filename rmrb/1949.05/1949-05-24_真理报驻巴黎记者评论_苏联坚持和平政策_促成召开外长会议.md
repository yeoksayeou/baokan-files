Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 23rd: TASS, Moscow: Pravda's Paris correspondent Zhukov wrote about the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference opening today, saying that in the face of the Soviet Union's unwavering peace-loving policy, Western countries were forced to abandon their strategy of resisting this very important international institution established under the Potsdam Agreement to prepare peace treaties with Germany and other former enemy countries. This news brought relief to the French and the world's public. Referring to the French newspaper comments on the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Zhukov wrote: No one in Paris has any illusions that the British and French delegations may have any independent performance at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Although the American plan has many places that do not conform to the interests of Britain and France, British and French diplomats will eventually follow the policies of the United States. Zhukov pointed out that the news published in British and French newspapers almost uniformly stated that the three Western countries would form a "united front" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The sole purpose of spreading these words is to deceive public opinion and deliberately create a tense atmosphere in order to obtain certain decisions that some American groups hope for. Zhukov then said that, judging from the Paris newspapers, it is entirely possible that the representatives of the three Western countries will try to force the Soviet Union to accept some of their "conditions" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, more than once experience has proved that this method cannot be applied to the Soviet Union. At the time of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the French public expected that those who advocated acting with pressure and command methods could abandon this attempt this time, which is to unconditionally accept our plan, otherwise there would be no agreement.

　　真理报驻巴黎记者评论
  　苏联坚持和平政策
  　促成召开外长会议
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫就今日开幕的苏美英法四国外长会议撰文称，在苏联坚持不移的爱好和平政策的面前，西方国家被迫放弃了抵制这一根据波茨坦协定设立的准备对德国及其他前敌国缔结和约的非常重要的国际机构的策略，这一消息使法国及全世界公众感到宽舒。提及法国报纸上关于外长会议的评论时，朱可夫写道：巴黎无人幻想英法代表团在外长会议上可能有任何独立的表现。虽然美国的计划有许多地方不符合英法的利益，但是英法外交人员最后仍将追随美国的政策。朱可夫指出，英法报纸所刊载的消息，几乎千篇一律地说，三西方国家在外长会议上将结成“统一战线”。散播这些言词，其唯一目的是蒙蔽舆论，故意制造紧张空气，以便取得某些美国集团所希望的决定。朱可夫接着说，就巴黎报纸判断，西方三国代表完全有可能在外长会议上试图强使苏联接受他们的某些“条件”。但是，不只一次的经验证明了这种办法不能施于苏联。在外长会议开会之时，法国公众期望那些主张用压力和命令方法行事的人，这次能够放弃这种企图，这就是无条件接受我们的计划，否则就没有任何协议。
