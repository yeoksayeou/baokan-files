(Taihang Dispatch) After the liberation of Anyang City by our army, Wang Sanzhu, commander of the temporarily organized 9th Column of the enemy's 40th Army, and Cheng Wanfu, head of the 3rd Security Regiment of the puppet Henan Administrative Region, attempted to disguise themselves and escape into hiding. However, they ultimately failed to escape our net due to the strict investigation by the Public Security Department of our Military Control Commission and the active assistance of the masses, and were captured by us at 8:00 AM on the 9th of this month.
