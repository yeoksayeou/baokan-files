　　Transforming Vagrants Through Labor!
    450 Beggars, Thieves, and Demobilized Soldiers from Beiping
    Form a Labor Production Brigade
  　To Go South and Participate in the Repair of the Yellow River
    [Report from this newspaper] A group of people who were forced to lose their opportunity to work in the old society departed from Beiping on May 25th for the Fourth Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Commission in Hexi County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, to engage in the labor of repairing the Yellow River. This is the first labor production brigade organized by the North China People's Government and the Beiping Municipal People's Government, including 121 beggars and thieves, and 326 demobilized soldiers, led by 103 veterans. This team of 550 people was organized according to the proposal of Commander Nie Rongzhen at the enlarged meeting of the North China People's Government Committee on April 16th, with the guiding principles of labor, transformation, education, and unity. The reactionary rulers not only created a large number of beggars through economic bankruptcy, but also often took measures to expel beggars from the city regardless of their lives for the sake of the city's appearance. The People's Government, with a responsible attitude, seeks a way out for beggars to work, so that they can support themselves. When they repair the river, their wages will be calculated according to the amount of earthwork they do. When they are transferred or cannot work due to rain, they can still get food. Those who currently have no clothing and bedding will be lent to them by the government in advance, and they will be allowed to repay it from their wages without interest. Before their thinking has been transformed, although forced labor is necessary, the unity and education of the veterans towards them is kind and moving. After many days of education, most of them happily complied. They said, "Repairing the Yellow River can make a contribution, and also let everyone know that we are not liberated for nothing." This brigade is led by Comrade Liu Jingxiu, Deputy Director of the Veterans Administration Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and is accompanied by two doctors. Other newly liberated large cities will organize labor production brigades based on the same principles.

　　从劳动改造游民！
    平市乞丐小偷散兵四百五十人
    组成劳动生产大队
  　南下参加修治黄河
    【本报讯】一群在旧社会上被迫失去劳动机会的人，于五月二十五日由北平开赴冀鲁豫河西县黄委会第四修防处，从事修治黄河的劳动。这是由华北人民政府和北平市人民政府所组织的第一个劳动生产大队：包括乞丐小偷一百二十一人，流散军人三百二十六人。由荣誉军人一百○三人领导。这一个五百五十人的队伍，是根据四月十六日华北人民政府委员会临时扩大会议上聂荣臻司令员的提议而组织的，以劳动、改造、教育、团结为方针。反动统治者既以经济的破产制造了大批乞丐，又常为了市容而对乞丐采取不顾死活的驱逐出境办法。人民政府则以负责的态度，为乞丐寻找劳动的出路，使之能自食其力。他们在修河时，将依所作土方之多少计算工资，在调动及因天雨而不能作工时，仍可得到伙食的供给。目前无衣被者，并由政府先行贷给，允其从工资中无利偿还。在他们思想尚未改造以前，虽然必须强制劳动，但荣誉军人对他们的团结和教育是亲切而使他们感动的。经过多日的教育，他们大部欣然乐从。他们说：“修黄河能立点功名，也使大家知道我们不是白解放了。”这一大队由民政部荣军管理处副处长刘敬修同志领导，并有医生二名随行。其他新解放大城市均将以同一的原则组织劳动生产大队。
