    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd (Delayed Dispatch): Since the important cities of Zhenjiang and Wuxi along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway were liberated on April 23rd and 24th respectively, order within the cities has been rapidly restored. The Zhenjiang Military Control Commission and the People's Government entered the city and began operations on the day of Zhenjiang's liberation. Former Kuomintang military and government offices, municipal enterprises, factories, and other public buildings were well-preserved and undamaged under the protection and guard of the People's Liberation Army. Power plants, waterworks, flour mills, telecommunications bureaus, railway stations, meteorological observatories, and most other facilities are operating as usual. All twenty-five middle schools and above, and seventy-six primary schools in the city are holding classes as usual. Electricity, telephone, and water services in the urban area have not been interrupted. The post office began accepting mail to areas north of the Yangtze River and newly liberated areas south of the Yangtze River on the day after liberation. The Nanjing-Changzhou section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been opened to traffic, and the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou ferry service resumed the day after liberation. Long-distance telephone lines to Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places are open, except for the underwater cables to Yangzhou, which were damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops and are awaiting repair. The Military Control Commission is currently carrying out the takeover work according to the original plan. In Wuxi, an important industrial city on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, 300 factories in various industries, including the four major cotton mills of Shenxin and Yixin (both jointly owned by public and private interests), Lixin and Guangfeng (both privately owned), have largely resumed work within four days after liberation under the protection of the People's Liberation Army. Before liberation, workers had organized many factory protection groups or pickets to preserve equipment and materials from destruction by the Kuomintang bandits. The city's power supply and postal services have not been interrupted. The Wuxi-Jiangyin highway bus service resumed operation on the third day after Wuxi's liberation.
