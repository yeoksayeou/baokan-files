    "Rather Die Than Be a Prisoner"
    War Criminal Yan Xishan Uses Ancient Slave Torture to Oppress the People and Rule His Troops

    "Number One, Number Two…" A little nurse standing outside the surgery room was handing out number牌子 to the wounded soldiers waiting for dressing changes. "Number Seven," a wounded prisoner of war with an injured right arm, walked over with heavy steps. Look at his face – so black, so dirty, dry and without a trace of blood. He wore a tattered military cap, covered in dust. He handed the number two 牌子 to the little nurse and went into the surgery room. The nurse comrade took off his tattered upper garment and carefully used alcohol-soaked cotton to rub and disinfect the wound on his right arm. When she wiped the upper part of his wrist, the nurse comrade suddenly paused. She saw a string of blue characters tattooed on the prisoner of war’s face: “Rather Die Than Be Once A Prisoner.” The hospital's deputy director, who happened to be passing by, read it aloud. The prisoner of war immediately lowered his head. After his dressing was changed, I had the following conversation with him under the sunlit wall:
    "What is your name?"
    "Bu Yuanli."
    "You have already been a prisoner of war once?"
    "Yes!"
    "Why are those words tattooed on your arm?"
    He didn't speak, slowly raised his right arm, pulled up his sleeve, and let me see the six distinct, indelible tattooed blue characters: "Rather Die Than Be a Prisoner." He silently lowered his head, deeply pained.
    I asked him, "Did you tattoo this yourself?"
    "Ah! This happened the year before last in April! During the Zhengtai Campaign, the People’s Liberation Army liberated me in Fangaoshan, Pingding County. That was the first time I was a prisoner. I am from Shangzhou, Shaanxi. I was conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang. The People's Liberation Army released me to go home, but I was captured again by Yan Xishan's troops on the way. They sent me to the 'Anti-Dry Corps' for training. Life there was unbearable. We were not fed enough and were beaten. It was worse than being in prison. Every day, they forced us to 'confess' and then tattooed these words on us. This was to keep us alive! If we didn't get the tattoo, they would beat us to death with clubs. I don't know how many people were beaten to death by Yan Xishan's vicious methods." At this point, he was too pained to continue. This is a bloody accusation, accusing the top war criminal Yan Xishan of how he barbarically insulted the people and his army! War criminal Yan Xishan is truly a feudal demon of modern China. He habitually uses the cruel punishments that ancient slave owners used on slaves to rule the people and his troops, but what use is this extremely barbaric and cruel crime other than to accelerate his collapse?
    Taiyuan has been liberated. Now, not only has Bu Yuanli been a prisoner twice, but Yan Xishan's 38-year rule in Shanxi has also been completely crushed and eradicated by the people and the People's Liberation Army. [Taiyuan Frontline Telegram]

    “至死不做俘虏”
    战犯阎锡山用古代奴隶的酷刑压迫人民统治他的部队
    “一号，二号……”，站在外科室门外的小护士，正在给那些后来换药的伤员发号牌子。“七号”一个右臂负伤的伤俘，迈着沉重的脚步走了过来，你看他的这张脸呀，又黑又脏干巴巴的没有一点血色，头上戴着一顶破军帽，满是尘土。他把二号牌子递给了小护士，走进了外科室。护士同志把他那破烂不堪的上衣脱了，托起了他的右臂，细心的用着酒精棉花揉擦着伤口消毒，当擦到手腕的上部时护士同志突然一怔，他看见这个伤俘的脸上刺着一串蓝字“至死不做一次俘虏”，医院副院长碰巧过重念了一遍，伤俘立刻低下了头，等他换好药，我在朝阳的墙跟下和他进行以下的谈话：
    “你叫什么名字？”
    “卜元礼。”
    “你已经作过一次俘虏？”
    “嗯！”
    “你的胳膊上为什么刺着字啊？”
    他不言语慢慢的托起他自己的右臂挽起他的袖子，让我看那露出来的“至死不做俘虏”六个鲜明的永远洗刷不净的刺印蓝字。他沈默的低着头，痛心万状。
    我问他：“这难道是你自己刺的？”
    “唉！这还是前年四月的事哪！正太战役，解放军在平定县范高山解放了我，这是第一次做俘虏。我是陕西上州人，被国民党抓去当的兵，解放军放我回家，可是走到半路上又被阎锡山队伍把我抓去了，把我送到‘反干团’受训，那里的生活苦的没法说，吃不饱还受打，比住牢狱还厉害的多。每天逼着让‘自白’，然后给刺上这几个字，这是为了要条活命啊，如果不刺的话就要被他们乱棒打死，不知多少人的生命，在阎锡山这一个毒辣的手段下被活活打死了。”说到这里他痛苦的说不下去了。这是一篇血的控诉，控诉头等战争罪犯之一阎匪锡山，他对于人民、对于他的军队，曾经如何野蛮地施行侮辱！战犯阎锡山真正是中国近代的封建魔王，他惯用古代奴隶主对待奴隶的酷刑统治人民、统治他的部队，但是这种极端野蛮惨酷的罪行，除了加速他的崩溃而外，又有什么用处呢？
    太原解放了，现在不仅卜元礼做了二次俘虏，阎匪在山西三十八年的统治也被人民和人民解放军彻底摧垮，连根拔除。  【太原前线电】
