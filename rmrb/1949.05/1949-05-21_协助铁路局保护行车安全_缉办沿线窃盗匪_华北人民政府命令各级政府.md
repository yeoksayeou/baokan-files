　　Assisting the Railway Bureau in Protecting Traffic Safety
    Pursuing and Arresting Thieves and Bandits Along the Line
  　Order from the North China People's Government to All Levels of Government
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China People's Government recently ordered all levels of government to assist the Railway Bureau in protecting traffic safety and to pursue and arrest thieves and coal bandits along the line. The order stated: "Received a letter from the Pingjin Railway Administration of the Ministry of Railways: 'The railway line is rife with thieves and coal bandits, their organizations are quite tight, their methods are emerging one after another, endangering travelers, stealing road materials, and causing great harm. After detailed discussion by the Public Security Department of this Railway Bureau, a "Provisional Measures for Preventing Theft and Coal Bandits at Stations and on Trains" has been drafted. As it relates to local governments, please notify the local governments along the line to investigate and handle it.' etc.; Now, Articles 4 and 6 of the said measures, which are related to local governments, are excerpted below: Article 4: The Public Security Section should establish practical connections with the following units; stations and railway lines are adjacent to local jurisdictions, and thieves and coal bandits often flee to local jurisdictions after committing crimes to avoid capture. The Public Security Section should establish close ties with local public security organs to facilitate the mutual arrest, so that they have nowhere to escape. Article 6: Criminals arrested by inspectors and police officers belonging to the Public Security Section should be treated leniently if they commit the crime for the first time. The section will give them three to five days of study time and carry out persuasive education; (if necessary, make them confess publicly in the street government of their residence), and order them to write a letter of repentance, stamped with all ten fingerprints, and then release them. However, habitual thieves who have been absorbed but have not yet started stealing will also be treated as first-time offenders. Those who commit the crime for the second time should be ordered to confess to the public the course of the two crimes and how they will be enlightened in the future (if necessary, make them confess publicly in the street government of their residence again), and grant bail release based on the severity of the circumstances. Or, the section should contact the district street governments or rural district and county governments at all levels to implement transformation education, so that they can consciously reflect, and assist them in transferring to agricultural work, so that they can start anew. Those who commit the crime for the third time should be sent to the competent People's Court for handling in accordance with the law, and the court is requested to impose security measures."
