　　Labor Hero Xiang Tishui and the Production Movement in Shili Village
    Wang Nong
    I. Mutual Aid Organizations in Shili Village
    Shili Village, in Huguan County, Taihang District, under the leadership of village Party secretary and labor hero Xiang Tishui, has become a model production village in the county. The village's "Get Organized" movement began in 1943 and has been going on for six years. During this time, it has been continuously improved and developed, and has never collapsed. The main reason is that labor hero Xiang Tishui and the cadres are good at practical leadership, specifically understand the demands of the masses, and solve problems in a timely manner, so that the masses can recognize the benefits of mutual aid from their actual interests. In 1943, when a few people started mutual aid, Xiang Tishui personally led a mutual aid group to create experience and serve as a typical demonstration to promote the organization of the entire village. By 1947, those organized accounted for more than 80% of the village's households. At the beginning, they did not understand the mutual aid policy and had no experience. Several male laborers simply exchanged labor during the busy farming season. However, when farm work was particularly urgent (such as spring plowing, sowing, and harvesting), the male labor force was not enough. Therefore, in 1944, Xiang Tishui's group organized women and children to participate, improving from simple male mutual aid to full family mutual aid. Due to the unequal strength of the labor force, disputes arose over the amount of work done and the quality of technology. Tishui then led everyone to study and discuss, and democratically stipulated that the strength of the labor force should be rated, work should be counted according to the amount of work done, work should be assessed both when alive and when dead, work should be evaluated in the field, accounts should be recorded at home, and a mutual aid system of "checking accounts every five days, settling accounts every half month, and clearing work every season" should be democratically formulated. Because errors often occurred in implementation, Tishui and the masses researched the use of work tickets and a reward system. This not only reduced errors, but also was flexible and simple, reducing the trouble of bookkeeping. In 1945, war support was heavy, and Shili Village contributed 3,600 labor days for war support. Under the conditions of heavy tasks and a shortage of labor, a contradiction formed between production and support for the front. Tishui led everyone to organize and implement village-wide labor exchange, which solved this problem and was very popular with the masses. For example, in 1945, during the autumn harvest, all the male labor force in the village supported the battles to liberate Huguan and Changzhi for more than 40 days, but the autumn harvest in the entire area was successfully stored without loss. Later, the "Three Major Combinations" (unified accounting for agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support) were used, and dividends were distributed according to the surplus labor force, promoting the mutual development of agriculture and sideline occupations, and achieving many results. However, some dissatisfaction was also caused by issues such as complicated work conversion, troublesome bookkeeping, time-consuming account clearing, and difficulty in equalizing prices. In 1948, they began to overcome the formalism of combining everything and mutual aid at all times. Although it was not as grand and vigorous as before on the surface, a lot of work was actually done. For example, in addition to mutual aid production during the busy farming seasons such as spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn plowing last year, general life was done by oneself if one could do it, and small-scale mutual aid of three or five people was flexibly carried out if one could not do it by oneself. This was neither laissez-faire, nor formalistic, and very natural. At present, the mutual aid organization in the village is becoming more and more consolidated, and the masses reflect that "mutual aid is mutually beneficial, no one suffers losses, and everyone benefits from being organized."

    II. Overcoming Labor Difficulties and Increasing Production by Five Dou Per Mu
    After six years of mutual aid production, the village has created a lot of experience and achieved many results. In agriculture, the management has been improved, technology has been improved, the cultivated area has been expanded (120 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed), and grain production has been increased. The whole village has 15 qing of land, and the yield per mu has increased by 5 dou and 1.7 sheng compared with before the war (laissez-faire production). The average increase per household is 5 shi, 5 dou and 6.8 sheng, and the total increase in the village is 779 shi and 5 dou. In terms of cultivation, before the war, those who plowed three times accounted for 12%, and those who hoeed three times accounted for 5.7%. After mutual aid, those who plowed three times accounted for 19.56%, and those who hoeed three times accounted for 34.5%. In terms of fertilization, before the war, an average of 62 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu, and after organization, an average of 80 dan was applied per mu. In terms of labor, it was far less than before the war, and there was more war support, but because feudalism was eliminated and they were organized, the output exceeded the pre-war level, and sideline occupations and handicrafts were developed. More than 150 women in the village learned to spin, and 23 learned to weave. They can produce 1,300 jin of homespun cloth every year, which basically solves the difficulty of dressing themselves. The men also organized cooperative workshops, transportation and sales, and other sideline production. According to statistics for 1946 alone, they earned 361.9 shi of millet. The number of livestock has increased from 90 before mutual aid to 163, and the number of sheep has increased from 120 to more than 400. As a result of organizing production, the painful life of "half a year of bran and vegetables" that Shili Village had for thousands of years has been changed.

    III. From Detours to the Right Track
    In the process of the development of mutual aid groups, some detours were taken and mistakes were made. For example, the formalism in 1947 forced the masses to completely combine all walks of life, violating the three principles of mutual aid (voluntary, equal value, and democracy), arousing dissatisfaction among the masses. Especially after the "squeezing out feudalism" in July, the mutual aid group took a simple "poor peasant and farm laborer line," attacking middle peasants, making the masses suspicious, and unable to figure out the direction of mutual aid. In response to these errors, the cadres made self-criticisms in front of the masses, criticized the tendency of coercion and command, combining everything and mutual aid at all times, promoted democracy, grasped the season according to the opinions of the masses, did not violate the farming season, and conscientiously implemented the principles of mutual aid, putting the mutual aid organization on the right track.

    IV. New Plans and New Directions
    In order to further improve the mutual aid organization and carry out a large-scale production movement, Xiang Tishui is leading the reorganization of the old mutual aid organization this year. Through joint research by the Party branch, it was decided to adopt new methods of reorganizing mutual aid: first, overcome the past formalism of simply holding meetings to reorganize mutual aid and forcing the masses to self-criticize their attitude towards mutual aid. Meetings of activists in production and other discussion meetings were held, and cadres and Party members started by self-criticizing the administrative command style in the past leadership and educating the masses on the mutual aid policy. Let the masses understand the spirit of mutual aid, distinguish the achievements and shortcomings of past mutual aid, and turn the reorganization of mutual aid into a conscious and voluntary action of the masses. As a result, the masses formed a wave of self-seeking objects and free combination of mutual aid, fully promoting the spirit of democracy and voluntarism of the masses. Ninety households in the village have voluntarily formed 15 groups, accounting for 64.3% of the total number of households. The rest are still considering their respective mutual aid objects, and the cadres are still enlightening and guiding them. This reorganization is not as hasty as the previous reorganizations, which were limited to temporary tension and enthusiasm in form, but is carried out on the basis of improving the mutual aid awareness of the masses. Let the masses know that they cannot become rich without organizing production; at the same time, it is not necessary to be completely organized to carry out mutual aid production; a method of reorganizing while producing can be adopted to closely combine the reorganization of mutual aid and production work.

    Because most of the masses have organized themselves in harmony, they require organized, led, and planned production. Therefore, Xiang Tishui and all Party members have initially drafted a production plan and submitted it to the People's Congress for discussion. The whole village has 1,729 mu of land, and the plan is to increase production by 86.45 shi. The main method of increasing production is intensive cultivation. Increase fertilizer, and 140 mu of wheat fields should be universally hoeed. The remaining autumn land is planned to be plowed and harrowed three times for 4/10, and hoeed three times for 5/10, with an average of 95 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. In addition, it is planned to increase livestock by 23 heads, increase sheep by 115, pigs by 10, and chickens by 746. After this plan was formulated, it was proposed by the Party branch, studied and approved by the People's Congress, and then a village meeting of more than 300 people was convened to celebrate the end of land reform. At the meeting, Xiang Tishui repeatedly explained the policy and emphasized: "The Communist Party led us to carry out land reform in order to liberate production and develop production; now that land reform has been completed this year, the main task in the future is to produce and become rich." Subsequently, the chairman of the People's Congress announced the village's production plan, and the masses discussed it in groups and unanimously proposed: "Always follow the Communist Party! Land reform has liberated us, and production will make us rich." Now they are actively carrying out all the production work of spring plowing and sowing, and 130,000 dan of manure have been sent to the fields; at the same time, attention is paid to overcoming formalism in practical actions, and the strength is appropriately allocated according to the amount of life. For example, Tishui's group has a lot of fertilizer, so it needs to use more labor to carry it; general work such as carrying soil and repairing banks is carried out by one or two people.

　　劳动英雄向提水与十里村的生产运动
    望农
    一、十里村的互助组织
    太行区壶关县十里村，在村支书、劳动英雄向提水的领导下，成了全县的生产模范村。该村的“组织起来”运动，从一九四三年开始，到现在已有六年历史，其间不断的改进和发展，一直没有垮过台，其主要原因，是劳英向提水和干部们善于实际领导，具体了解群众要求，及时解决问题，使群众从实际利益中认识到互助的好处。在一九四三年有少数人开始起来互助时，向提水就亲自领导了一个互助小组，创造经验，典型示范，推动全村组织起来。到一九四七年，组织起来的即占全村户数百分之八十以上。开始时不了解互助政策，也没经验，只是几个男劳力在农忙时进行拨工，但农事特别紧迫时（如春耕、下种、收割等），男劳力不够用，因此，一九四四年向提水组便组织妇女儿童参加，由单纯的男人互助改进到全家全力互助。由于劳力强弱不等，在做活多少，技术好坏上曾发生了争执，提水便领导大家研究讨论，民主规定，以劳力强弱评分，按做活多少计工，按死分活计，在地头评功评工，回家记帐，并民主制定“五天一对帐，半月一结算，一季一清工”的互助制度。由于在实行中时常发生差错，提水又和群众研究出使用工票与奖励制度。这样不但减少了差错，而且灵活简便，减去了记帐的麻烦。一九四五年，战勤繁重，十里村共出战勤劳力工三千六百个。在任务大、劳力缺的情况下，形成了生产与支前的矛盾，提水就领导大家组织起来实行全村大变工，解决了这一难题，很得群众拥护。如一九四五年正值秋收时间，全村全部男力支援解放壶关、长治的战役，历时四十多天，但全区秋收却无损失地胜利收仓。后来又运用“三大结合”（农业、副业与战勤统一计工），按剩余劳力分红，推动了农副业的相互发展，取得不少成绩。但由于折工复杂，记帐麻烦，清帐费时，等价难公诸问题，也引起一些不满。一九四八年，开始克服事事结合与时时互助的形式主义，表面上虽不如以前之轰轰烈烈，但实际上做的活却不少。如去年除在春耕、夏耘、秋耕等农忙季节进行了互助生产外，一般的生活都是自己能干就由自己干，自己干不了就结合三五人的小型互助灵活进行，这样既不自流，也不形式，又很自然。目前该村的互助组织日趋巩固，群众反映是“互助互利，互不吃亏，组织起来大家沾光”。
    二、克服劳力困难，每亩增产五斗
    该村经过六年的互助生产，创造了不少经验，取得了不少成绩。在农业上，改善了经营，提高了技术，扩大了耕地面积（开荒一百二十亩），增加了粮食产量。全村土地十五顷，每亩比战前（自流生产）增产五斗一升七，每家平均增产五石五斗六升八，全村共增产七百七十九石五。在耕作上，战前耕三遍的占百分之十二，锄三遍的占百分之五点七，互助起来，耕三遍的占百分之一九点五六，锄三遍的占百分之三四点五。在施肥上，战前每亩地平均施肥六二担，组织起来后每亩平均八○担。在劳力上，远比战前少，且战勤多，但由于消灭了封建，又组织了起来，因此产量反而超过了战前水平，而且发展了副业和手工业。全村有一百五十多个妇女学会纺花，二十三人学会织布，每年能产土布一千三百斤，基本上解决了自己穿衣的困难。男人们又组织了合作作坊、运销等副业生产，据一九四六年一年统计，即赚小米三六一点九石。牲口由互助前的九十头发展到一六三头，羊由一百二十只发展到四百余只。由于组织起来进行生产的结果，把十里村几千年来“糠菜半年粮”的痛苦生活改变过来。
    三、从弯路走上正轨
    在互助组发展的过程中也走了一些弯路，犯过错误。如一九四七年的形式主义，逼着群众把各行各业完全实行结合，违犯了互助三原则（自愿、等价、民主），惹起群众不满，尤其经过七月“挤封建”后，互助组走了单纯的“贫雇路线”，打击了中农，使群众怀疑，摸不清互助方向。针对这些错误，干部在群众面前作了检讨，批判了这种强迫命令，事事互助，时时互助的偏向，发扬了民主，根据群众意见掌握季节，不违农时，认真执行互助原则，把互助组织推上正轨。
    四、新计划与新方向
    为了更进一步地提高互助组织，开展大生产运动，今年向提水又领导着整顿了旧的互助组织。通过支部共同研究，决定新的整顿互助方法：首先克服以往那种光用开大会整顿互助和硬让群众检讨互助态度的形式主义作风，召开了生产中的积极分子会和其他座谈会，干部党员从检讨过去领导上的行政命令作风入手，对群众进行互助政策教育。让群众体会互助精神分清了以往互助中的成绩与缺点，把整顿互助变成了群众自觉自愿的行动。于是群众便形成了自找对象，自由结合的互助浪潮，充分发扬了群众的民主自愿的精神。全村九十户，已自愿结合起十五个小组，占全村户数的百分之六四点三。其余的仍在考虑各自的互助对象，干部仍在启发引导。这次整顿不象过去那样性急的整顿，流于形式上一时的紧张热烈，而是在提高群众的互助觉悟基础上进行。使群众知道不组织起来生产，就不能发家；同时也不是一定要完全组织起来才能互助生产；可采取一面整顿一面生产的方法，使整顿互助和生产工作紧密结合进行。
    由于大部群众情投意合地组织起来了，就要求有组织有领导有计划地进行生产，于是向提水和全体党员初步拟出了生产计划交人代会讨论。全村共地一七二九亩，计划增产八六点四五石。增产方法主要是精耕细作。多增肥，一百四十亩麦田要普遍进锄。其余秋地计划十分之四耕三耙三，十分之五锄三，每亩施肥平均九五担。此外计划增殖牲口二十三头，增羊一一五只，猪十只，鸡七四六只。这个计划订出后，由支部提出，人代会研究通过，便召集三百余人的村民大会，庆祝土改结束。会上，向提水反复地讲明政策，强调指出：“共产党领导咱们进行土改，就是为了解放生产，发展生产；今年土改完成了，今后主要工作就是生产致富。”随后人代会主席宣布了全村生产计划，群众分组讨论，一致提出：“永远跟着共产党走！土改翻了身，生产去发家。”现在正在积极进行春耕下种的一切生产工作，已送到地里粪十三万担；同时在实际行动中注意了克服形式主义，按生活多少，适当的分配力量。如提水组肥多，就需要多用几个劳力去担；一般的担岸土，整岸边，就是一个两个的进行。
