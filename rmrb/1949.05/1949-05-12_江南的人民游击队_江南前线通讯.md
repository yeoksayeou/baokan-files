    The People's Guerrilla in Jiangnan
    Frontline Dispatches from Jiangnan
    After three and a half years of bitter struggle, the Jiangnan People's Guerrilla, when they victoriously joined forces with the People's Liberation Army's field army advancing south across the Yangtze, was already a very strong force.
    In the winter of 1945, the Jiangnan New Fourth Army, in order to strive for domestic peace, and in accordance with the "Double Tenth Agreement," painfully withdrew north. The Kuomintang bandit gang also began their brutal "suppression" of the people of Jiangnan at that time. Countless young farmers were brutally arrested and killed. The Kuomintang prisons in Danyang, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and other places were filled with these victims. In Mao (Shan) Dong County in the guerrilla area alone, more than 200 people were arrested. In a district of Dan (Yang) South County in the guerrilla area, 20 people were killed at the same time in one instance. The guerrillas had to disperse into smaller groups, hiding in the deep mountains and valleys and fields during the day, relying on the masses to persist in the struggle. Farmers on the plains dug underground bunkers, built secret rooms, and modified the structure of their houses, trying every possible means to hide their guerrilla sons and soldiers. Many farmers were arrested as a result, but they resolutely said in the bandits' criminal courts: The common people only remember the New Fourth Army. Killing and deceiving are useless.
    The Kuomintang army "suppressing" the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui used vicious methods such as migrating and merging villages, and burning mountains to create no-man's lands. However, the guerrillas bravely stormed into enemy strongholds, killed the most heinous enemies, and warned the local bullies and landlords who supported the "suppression." In three attacks on Dahua Township in Wuxing, the People's Guerrilla once annihilated a company of the enemy's security regiment, captured dozens of evil puppet township chiefs, and seized four light and heavy machine guns and 70 rifles. The leading comrades of the guerrilla often looked for all possible information to study the development of the situation, and conducted current affairs education every few days to further strengthen the guerrillas' will to fight. They not only shattered the enemy's successive "suppressions," but also eliminated many enemy armed forces and township offices, and expanded the guerrilla base areas.
    In the cruel struggle, many Communist Party members and guerrilla fighters gloriously sacrificed themselves. Ma Zhenglou and another comrade, armed work team members from Zhenjiang, fought bravely for three hours surrounded by several times their number of enemies, and sang songs calmly before being killed after capture. Huan Desheng, the Minister of Organization of the CPC Danyang County Committee, and four other comrades were surrounded by an enemy security battalion. After several hours of fierce fighting, they were wounded, and in order not to be captured, they gloriously committed suicide. Geng Rongfu, the leader of the armed work team of the First District of Danyang, and Communist Party member He Fuyuan, and three others were surrounded by a company of the bandit's 54th Army in a building outside the West Gate of Danyang. The enemy repeatedly charged but failed to climb the building, and then dispatched a battalion, placing all the heavy machine guns on the surrounding rooftops and firing fiercely at the isolated building. The barrage lasted all night. Geng Rongfu and other comrades still stubbornly resisted, wrapping their wounded bodies in quilts. Finally, they burned all the documents and destroyed their weapons, and then heroically committed suicide. With this fearless heroism, they persisted in the enemy's rear, leading the people to carry out struggles against conscription, grain requisition, and rent. The enemy's conscription was so crazy that every household in Qilin Village, with 300 households, was arrested and extorted more than five times. In the past year, the enemy had conscripted eight rounds of recruits in the village. For each missing person, they forced the family to pay compensation of 18 to 24 piculs of rice. Under the leadership of the guerrillas, the strong young farmers in various places collectively escaped to secret underground bunkers in the wilderness, setting up secret sentry posts. If there were few enemy soldiers, they would fight; if there were many, they would run. The Jiangnan guerrillas and the suffering people of Jiangnan forged a bond of life and death in the struggle for resistance.
    After the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive last year, the Jiangnan guerrillas developed even more. In December, the Su-Zhe-Wan guerrilla area had 500 farmers joining the army in just one recruitment drive. When the three armies simultaneously broke through the enemy's river defenses, the Jiangnan People's Guerrilla and the people of Jiangnan ignited a raging fire of revenge that stretched for thousands of miles, burning down enemy碉堡 (blockhouses), cutting off the enemy's power lines, destroying roads that the defeated bandit army might pass through, attacking enemy strongholds, intercepting and searching for fleeing enemies, and victoriously joining forces with the main force of the Liberation Army after three years of separation on the land stained with the blood of the martyrs.

    江南的人民游击队
    江南前线通讯
    经过三年半惨酷斗争锻炼的江南人民游击队，当他们和渡江南征的人民解放军野战大军胜利会师时，已经是一支很壮大的队伍了。
    一九四五年冬天，江南新四军为了争取国内和平，遵照“双十协定”忍痛北撤。国民党匪帮也就在那时候开始了对江南人民的惨酷“清剿”。无数青年农民惨遭逮捕杀害、丹阳、镇江、无锡和各地的国民党监狱里挤满了这些被难者，仅游击区茅（山）东县一地就被捕二百余人，游击区丹（阳）南县一个区在一次同时被杀二十人。游击队不得不化整为零，白天隐蔽到深山空谷和田野里去，依靠群众，坚持斗争。平原上的农民在家里挖地洞，筑密室，改造房屋结构，想尽种种办法隐藏自己的游击子弟兵。不少农民因而被捕，但是他们在匪徒的刑庭上仍坚决的说：老百姓心里就记着新四军，你们要杀要骗都没有用。
    “清剿”苏浙皖边区的国民党军，用移民并村、烧山搜山等毒辣手段制造无人区。但是游击队勇敢地冲进敌人据点，打死了首恶的敌人，警告那些支持“清剿”的恶霸地主。在三次进攻吴兴的大华乡时，人民游击队曾在一次歼灭了敌保安团一个连，俘虏作恶的伪乡长等数十人，缴轻重机枪四挺，步枪七十支。游击队的领导同志经常寻找一切可能的资料，研究形势发展，每隔几天便进行一次时事教育，以更加坚定游击队的斗争意志。他们不但粉碎了敌人的历次“清剿”，而且消灭了许多敌人的武装和乡公所，扩大了游击根据地。
    在残酷的斗争中，许多共产党员和游击队员光荣牺牲了。镇江武装工作队员马正楼等二同志在数倍敌人的包围中奋战三个钟头，被俘后唱着歌从容就义。中共丹阳县委组织部长宦德胜等五位同志被敌一个保安大队包围，恶战数小时后负伤，为了不当俘虏，壮烈自戕。丹阳一区武工队长耿荣富和共产党员何复沅等三人被匪第五十四军一个连包围在丹阳西门外一座楼上，敌屡次冲杀未能登楼，又调来一个营把所有重机枪架在周围屋顶上向孤楼猛扫，整整打了一夜，耿荣富等同志还是不屈地用棉被裹着负伤的身体顽强抵抗，最后焚毁了所有的文件和毁了武器，然后英勇自杀。他们以这种无畏的英雄气概坚持敌后阵地，领导人民进行抗丁、抗粮、抗租等斗争。敌人抓丁是这样的疯狂，一个三百户人家的麒麟村每家都被敌人逮捕逼索五次以上。一年来敌人在该村即征了八期壮丁，少一个人，就逼令以十八石到二十四石米抵偿。在游击队领导下，各地壮丁农民集体逃避到野外的秘密地洞里，布上隐秘岗哨，匪军来得少他们就打来得多就跑。江南游击队与苦难的江南人民在相依为命的反抗斗争中结下了生死与共的缔盟。
    去年解放军秋季攻势后，江南游击队更大为发展，十二月苏浙皖游击区仅仅一次参军的农民就有五百人。当三路大军同时突破敌人的江防时，江南人民游击队和江南人民便燃起了漫延千里的复仇怒火，四出焚烧敌人的碉堡，切断敌军用电线，破击溃逃匪军可能经过的道路，攻打敌人据点，截击搜捕逃敌，在染遍了先烈血迹的土地上与离别三年的解放军主力胜利会师。
