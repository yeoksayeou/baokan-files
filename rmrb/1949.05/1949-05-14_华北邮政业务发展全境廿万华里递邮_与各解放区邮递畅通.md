    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China postal service has achieved significant development. The North China Postal Administration now has ten management bureaus, two postal savings and remittance bureaus, and three hundred and three county bureaus. Excluding military mail, it has formed a large team of over 10,000 people, over 400 livestock, and 24 postal vehicles. In the establishment of postal trunk lines, there are 2,800+ li from North China to various county bureaus where mail can be delivered. If we include district lines, it is nearly 200,000 li. Initial achievements have also been made in rural postal construction. Currently, in addition to the entire North China region having postal and package delivery, postal and package services are also available with the Northeast, Northwest, Suiyuan-Mongolia, Central Plains, and East China liberated areas, as well as the newly liberated Bengbu, Hefei, Wuhu, Mingguang, Jiashan, Taiyuan, Datong, Xinxiang, and Anyang. As for books, newspapers, and letters, they are completely unobstructed in all liberated areas of the country. In terms of mail services: currently, we handle letters, news drafts, newspapers, printed materials, business circulars, samples, packages, remittances, postcards, etc. Railway line bureaus also handle express mail and return receipt services. Regarding insured postal services, we handle insured packages, newspaper distribution, sale of stamp tax tickets, and transport services (horse-drawn carriages returning with mail also handle transport). We also plan to handle tax collection, purchase of ship tickets, bus tickets, and cash-on-delivery packages in the near future. Recently, Tianjin has also begun deposit and loan services. Last year, North China received a total of over 6 million pieces of mail and 25,370 packages. After the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin, in just March in Beiping and four months in Tianjin, a total of 4,130,294 pieces of mail and 26,651 packages were received, accounting for over 67% of the total mail for the entire North China region last year. However, there are still the following shortcomings that need to be improved: (1) In some places, the postal service still has instances of lost mail or misdirection, careless acceptance of mail, unclear addresses of recipients and senders on mail covers, and impersonation of official documents with private letters; (2) Some postal workers still lack enterprise awareness and a career perspective, the system cannot be implemented, work is chaotic and unplanned, rural postal construction and newspaper distribution are very weak, and there is a lack of regularized and scientific management; (3) Some local bureaus still lack a holistic view of centralized leadership and division of responsibilities; (4) The relationship between administration and the trade union is not close enough, and the integration is not good enough.

    华北邮政业务发展全境廿万华里递邮
    与各解放区邮递畅通
    【本报讯】华北邮政业务，已获重要发展。现华北邮政总局已辖有十个管理局，两个储金汇业局，三百零三个县局。除去军邮以外，已组成了一个一万多人、四百多头牲口、二十四部邮政汽车的庞大队伍。在邮路干线的建立上由华北到各县局，已有二千八百多华里可以通邮，如将区线算上将近二十万华里。乡邮建设亦已取得初步成绩。目前除华北全区已告通邮及包裹以外，和东北、西北、绥蒙、中原、华东等各解放区，及新解放之蚌埠、合肥、芜湖、明光、嘉山、太原、大同、新乡、安阳等地亦已通邮及包裹。至于书报、信函，在全国各解放区则已完全畅通。在邮件业务方面：目前已办理有信件、新闻稿、新闻纸、印刷品、商务传单、货样、包裹、汇兑、明信片等，在铁路沿线局子则已办理有快信、收取回件业务。关于保价邮务已办理的有保价包裹、发行报纸，代售印花税票，代办运输（运邮件回来的马车兼办运输）并计划在短期内办理代收税款，代买轮船票、汽车票，代收货价包裹；最近天津并已开始了存放款业务。去年华北全年共收到邮件六百多万件，包裹二万五千三百七十件，平津解放后，仅北平三月份一个月，加上天津四个月共收到邮件四百一十三万零二百九十四件，包裹二万六千六百五十一件，占去年全华北全年邮件总数百分之六十七强。但还有以下缺点尚须改进：（一）某些地方邮政尚有遗失邮件或转错方向的现象，接收邮件马虎，邮件封面收件人寄件人地址不清，以私人信冒充公文等；（二）某些邮政工件人员尚缺乏企业化认识与事业观点，制度不能贯彻，工作忙乱无计划，乡邮建设与报纸发行都很薄弱，缺乏正规化与科学化的管理；（三）有些地方局还缺乏集中领导与分工负责的整体观念；（四）行政与职工会关系还不密切，结合不够好。
