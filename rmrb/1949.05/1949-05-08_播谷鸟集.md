    Collection of Songs of the Sower Bird

    Land
    These lands
    Hold our blood and sweat
    These lands
    Hold our tears
    Year after year
    We till the land
    Wind and rain batter us
    We endure hunger and cold
    From spring to summer
    From summer to autumn
    We harvest the grain
    Only to have it seized by the landlords
    Now, these lands
    Are returned to us
    New land deeds
    Are in our hands
    We no longer weep
    Our hearts are filled with joy
    We cultivate
    And sow seeds
    One seed falls to earth
    Ten thousand return to the granary
    How good these lands are
    How fragrant these lands are

    Delivering Manure
    Clatter, clatter
    Clatter, clatter
    Whose wife is this
    Revealing her sturdy arms
    Taking large strides
    Pushing a dirt cart
    Cart after cart
    Bringing barnyard manure to the fields
    Sweat streams from her brow
    But her mouth holds a smile
    Her eyes are saying
    The days ahead will be better
    Fertilizer spread widely
    Granaries filled to the brim
    Clatter, clatter
    Clatter, clatter
    The dirt cart, too
    Unlike in past years
    When it always creaked and groaned
    Weeping and wailing
    Now it has changed
    It laughs aloud
    From village to field
    From field to village
    Clatter, clatter
    Clatter, clatter

    Harrowing
    A horse
    Pulls the harrow
    Forward
    Forward
    A person stands on the harrow
    Like standing on a raft
    In front of the harrow
    The land is like a river
    Behind the harrow
    The clods are like waves
    The willows are green
    The grass is also green
    The flowers are blooming
    The birds are singing
    The horse trots
    The harrow moves forward
    Forward
    Two white butterflies
    Fly from the field
    Across…
    How wide the land is
    How vast the land is
    The harrow flies along
    Flies along
    Back and forth
    To and fro
    The person on the harrow
    Shouts out
    While singing
    "The East is Red,
    The sun rises…"

    Watering
    The donkey walks
    The waterwheel turns
    A woman
    Sits by the waterwheel
    In her arms
    Lies a child
    The child sleeps sweetly
    The donkey walks
    The waterwheel turns
    When the donkey slows down
    The woman shouts
    And the donkey speeds up again
    Turning round and round
    The donkey walks
    The waterwheel turns
    Water from the buckets
    Pours out
    Pours out
    Flowing down
    Along the earthen ditch
    Flowing down
    Into the field
    The field shines brightly
    This is newly distributed land
    This is fragrant land
    This is beloved land
    The donkey walks
    The waterwheel turns
    A man
    Uses a hoe to guide the water
    The water seeps forward
    Seeps forward
    Soaking the dry earth
    The donkey walks
    The waterwheel turns
    The sun sets
    The sky darkens
    But they still don't go home
    As if they will even spend the night in the field
   
    Loosening Soil
    Old fellow,
    The wind is howling
    And it's getting dark
    Rest now!
    But he alone
    Hoe after hoe
    Loosens the yellow earth
    Wiping the sweat with his hand
    It's almost dark
    But he doesn't even notice
    Old fellow,
    The wind is blowing so hard
    The trees are swaying
    It's already dark
    Rest now!
    No,
    Spring brings easterly winds and night rain
    Before the rain comes
    Loosen the soil
    When the rain comes
    Let it soak through
    When the sky clears
    Sow the seeds

    Spring Rain
    Clouds come from the east
    It's raining
    From east to west
    From south to north
    The rain sprinkles on the Hebei Plain
    Farmers lead their livestock
    Back home
    The waterwheel is no longer turning
    The wheel has stopped
    Everywhere is soaked in rain
    Everywhere seems to be smiling
    A peasant woman
    Stands at the door watching the rain
    And says with a smile:
    "Now that we have land
    And it's raining too
    We have truly turned over"
    In the past
    Elm bark
    Locust pods
    Mung bean hulls
    Moldy bran cakes
    We ate anything
    Wheat and millet
    Went into the bellies of the landlords
    From now on
    The land is our own
    Just thinking about
    The grain we harvest
    All belonging to us
    Her heart blossoms
    Spring rain is as precious as oil
    Fall with all your might
    Soak the land through
    Eighty-three showers of rain
    Six or seven mu per acre
    We won't have to worry about food this year

    Magpie
    At the edge of the village
    There is a row of tall trees
    On the highest branch
    There is a magpie's nest
    The magpie stands on the treetop
    The first to see the sun
    It says in a hoarse voice:
    "The sun is rising!
    The sun is rising!"
    Its long tail
    Twitches up and down...
    It flies from the treetop
    And flies to the field
    A farmer
    Stands on the harrow
    Driving two donkeys
    From one end of the field
    To the other
    The magpie says to the farmer
    In a hoarse voice
    "The land is distributed,
    Congratulations! Congratulations!"

    Sower Bird
    Every spring
    The sower bird cries out
    "Harvest wheat, plant rice
    Harvest wheat, plant rice
    Landlords eat their fill
    Farmers go hungry"
    Sower bird, sower bird
    Seeing the hardship of the farmers
    Seeing the harvested grain
    Sent into the landlord's warehouse
    Its cry sounds like weeping
    Making people feel very sad
    This spring
    The sower bird cries again
    But its voice is different
    "Spring thunder has sounded
    The rain has also fallen
    Those who have turned over
    Hurry and plant grain!"

    土地
    这些土地
    有我们的血汗
    这些土地
    有我们的眼泪
    一年一年
    我们种地
    风吹雨淋
    忍饥受寒
    从春到夏
    从夏到秋
    收割下粮食
    被地主抢走
    现在，这些土地
    归还我们了
    新的地权证
    拿在我们手里
    我们不再流泪
    我们满心欢喜
    我们耕种
    撒下种子
    一子落地
    万颗归仓
    这些土地多么好
    这些土地多么香
    送粪
    咯隆隆
    咯隆隆
    谁家的媳妇
    露出粗壮的胳膊
    迈着大步
    推着土车
    一车一车
    把圈粪送到地里
    额上流着汗
    嘴上含着笑
    她的眼睛在说
    以后的日子好了
    肥料下地广
    粮食收满仓
    咯隆隆
    咯隆隆
    土车也一样
    不象往年
    老是葛吱吱
    葛吱吱地啼哭
    如今变了
    它大声地笑着
    从村庄到野地
    从野地到村庄
    咯隆隆
    咯隆隆
    耙地
    一匹马
    拉着耙
    向前
    向前
    人站在耙上
    象站在筏了
    耙的前面
    土地象河流
    耙的后面
    土块象水浪
    杨柳青了
    草也绿了
    花也开了
    鸟也叫了
    马路着
    耙向前
    向前
    两只白蝴蝶
    从地里
    飞过……
    地多么宽
    地多么广
    耙飞跑着
    飞跑着
    来来
    往往
    耙上的人
    一边吆喝
    一边唱歌
    “东方红
    太阳升……”
    浇地
    驴子走
    水车转
    一个妇女
    坐在水车边
    她的怀里
    躺着一个小孩
    小孩睡的甜又甜
    驴子走
    水车转
    驴子走慢了
    妇女就吆喝一声
    驴子又加快了
    转了几转
    驴子走
    水车转
    水从水斗
    倒出来
    倒出来
    沿着土沟
    往下流
    往下流
    流到地里
    地里白晃晃发亮
    这是新分到的土地
    这是发香的土地
    这是亲爱的土地
    驴子走
    水车转
    一个男人
    用锄头引着水
    水头向前渗
    向前渗
    浸透了干土
    驴子走
    水车转
    太阳下山了
    天也暗了
    但他们还不回去
    好象连夜里
    也要宿在地里
    掏土
    老乡啊
    刮大风了
    天也要黑了
    快休息吧
    只他一个人
    一锄又一锄
    掏着黄土
    用手抹着汗
    天快黑了
    他也不知道
    老乡啊
    风刮的好大
    树都摇摆了
    天已黑了
    快休息吧
    不，
    春发东风连夜雨
    趁雨没有来
    把地掏松
    雨来了
    让它浸个透
    等天晴了
    撒下种子
    春雨
    云从东方来
    天下雨了
    从东到西
    从南到北
    雨洒着冀中平原
    农民牵着牲口
    回去了
    水车不转了
    轮子停了
    到处都淋着雨水
    到处都好象在笑
    一个农妇
    站在门口看着雨
    笑着说：
    “有了地了
    天又下雨了
    真的翻了身”
    往年
    榆树皮
    槐树子
    绿豆壳子
    蒙糠饼子
    什么都吃
    麦子和谷子
    进了地主的肚子
    从今以后
    地是自己的
    一想到
    打下的粮食
    全归自己
    她的心开花了
    春雨贵如油
    拼命的下吧
    把土地灌透
    八十三场雨
    一亩六七亩
    今年吃饭不用愁
    喜鹊
    村子的边上
    有一排高树
    最高的枝枝上
    有一个喜鹊窝
    喜鹊站在树顶上
    最早看见太阳
    它哑着嗓子说：
    “太阳出来了！
    太阳出来了！”
    长长的尾巴
    一翘一翘……
    它从树顶飞走了
    飞到野地里
    一个农民
    站在耙上
    赶着两匹驴子
    从地的这一头
    到地的那一头
    喜鹊朝着农民
    哑着嗓子说
    “分了地了，
    恭喜！恭喜！”
    播谷鸟
    年年春天
    播谷鸟在叫唤
    “割麦插禾
    割麦插禾
    地主吃饱
    农民受饿”
    播谷鸟，播谷鸟
    看见农民的辛苦
    看见打下的粮食
    送进地主的仓库
    它的叫唤象是哭
    叫人听了很难受
    今年春天
    播谷鸟又叫唤
    声音可不同了
    “春雷响过
    雨也下过
    翻了身的人
    快种谷！”
