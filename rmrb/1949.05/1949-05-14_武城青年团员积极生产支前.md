[Jinan Telegram] Under the leadership of the Communist Party, members of the New Democratic Youth League in key villages of Wu Cheng have become powerful assistants in supporting the front and production work. In Tang Song Village, Second District, after receiving a notice from the district government one night to rush repair a long-unopened highway for the southward-bound army, League members Song Zifan, Song Zechen, and others immediately shouldered their shovels to help villagers mobilize others. Seventy villagers quickly arrived at the designated location and worked overnight to complete the task. Female League members, in coordination with the chairman of the trade union, mobilized all the women in the village to make comfort bags, mattress covers, bowl covers, honorary flowers, and honorary flags. Song Xiuying, a League member in Luoma Village, heard that the army was stationed in her village and put aside her chronically ill mother to take care of the army, helping them with laundry, boiling water, and mending shoes and socks. In production, responding to the township government's call for drought-resistant planting, they actively united young people and organized mutual aid planting to prepare for famine. Eighteen male and female League members in Tang Song Village, in conjunction with a dozen young people, formed two mutual aid groups, planting 27 mu of cotton and 12 mu of melons and vegetables. They also enthusiastically mobilized neighbors to break the mentality of relying on rain, and helped each other to solve the difficulties in planting. They persuaded their families to save food for famine relief, collected wild vegetables and other substitute foods, and used blackboards to commend production models and encourage mass sentiment. Due to the League members' active production and diligent study, they won praise from their families and society, giving a good influence to the nineteen villages that are currently establishing leagues. Young people are eager to organize, and young people in Wanzhuang and Wuzhuang automatically approached youth cadres to quickly establish leagues in their villages.

    【冀南电】武城重点村的新民主主义青年团团员，在共产党的领导下，成为支前与生产工作的有力助手。二区唐宋庄于某日夜间接到区政府通知，给南下大军赶修一条久未通车的公路，团员宋子范、宋泽臣等立即扛起铁锹帮助村民动员别人，全村七十名民工迅速到达指定地点，连夜赶修，完成任务。女团员协同工会主任发动全村妇女做慰问袋、褥套、碗套、光荣花、光荣旗等。骡马庄团员宋秀英，听说大军住到她村，撇开久病不起的母亲去照顾军队，帮助军队洗衣、烧水、缝补鞋袜。在生产中，乡厅政府抗旱点种号召，积极团结青年群众，组织互助点种备荒。唐宋庄男女团员十八名，串联青年群众十几人，组成两个互助组，种棉花二十七亩，瓜菜十二亩，还热情的动员邻舍街坊打破靠天等雨思想，互助起来解决点种中的困难。说服自己的家庭节约备荒，采集野菜等代食品，利用黑板报表扬生产模范，鼓励群众情绪。由于团员的积极生产努力学习，博得家庭及社会的好评，给正在建团的十九个村以良好影响。青年们都渴望组织起来，万庄、吴庄青年自动找青年干部，迅速去该村建团。
