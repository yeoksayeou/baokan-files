Taihang Trading Company
　　Specially Prepared Insecticide
　　Jidong Calls for Strict Prevention of Pests
　　[Taihang Electric] In order to help farmers eliminate pests, the Taihang Trading Company has specially purchased a batch of red alum from Henan, which has now been transported to Anyang and Xingtai. It has also notified the county and district cooperatives in the pest-affected areas to formulate plans based on their needs and obtain official certification documents from the county government or the cooperative section of the administrative office to contact the Anyang, Xingtai, Changzhi, and Zuoquan trading branches for purchase.
　　[Taihang Electric] The locust eradication campaign in eleven villages including Niuweigang in the third district of Cixian County and Xiaopengou in the seventh district has successfully concluded after three days of intense capturing and beating, catching more than 1,300 jin of locust nymphs. After locusts were discovered on the 1st of this month, Xu, the deputy district chief of the third district, promptly went to inspect and found that on a three-li long and one-li wide area at the junction of Niuweigang and Xiaopengou villages and outside Qianre village, there were newly emerged locust nymphs everywhere, with about 30 nymphs per square step in dense areas and more than a dozen in sparse areas. District Chief Xu immediately convened a meeting of the village cadres concerned, urgently mobilizing people to fight locusts to protect wheat and dispatching cadres to provide specific leadership. A total of more than 1,000 male and female laborers were mobilized for three days, capturing 1,354 jin of locust nymphs alive (not including those killed on the spot). At present, except for a few villages with sporadic small grasshoppers, the locust eradication campaign in the eleven villages has been successfully concluded.
　　[Jidong Electric] The Jidong Administrative Office recently issued a circular calling on local governments to pay attention to the prevention and control of insect pests. Last year, many places in the region suffered from insect pests, resulting in heavy losses of fruit trees. Mountain locusts and soil locusts bred in individual areas, affecting food production. Due to little snow last winter, pests are more likely to occur. Currently, locusts have been found in thirteen villages such as Chongjiayu in the sixth district of Qian'an County, which are close to the mountains, and wheat seedlings have been almost eaten up. The circular pointed out that after pests are discovered in various places, the masses should be immediately mobilized to use all effective methods in an organized manner, give play to the wisdom of the masses, and use local methods and local medicines to capture and kill them in a timely manner, and should not wait or delay. At the same time, it should be reported to higher levels immediately and directly to the administrative office and various farms for assistance in pest control.
　　[Chahar News] Langou Village and five other villages in the seventh district of Dingxing County discovered armyworms on wheat seedlings on the 30th of last month, causing great harm. The armyworm-infested wheat seedlings had their leaves broken a lot in just one noon. The district sent the armyworms to the county government, and the government has sent cadres with medicines to the district to organize the masses to capture and kill them.
