    Zhangjiakou-Datong Railway Opens to Traffic
    [Zhangjiakou News] The section of the Ping-Sui Railway between Zhangjiakou and Datong officially opened to traffic on the 3rd. The area west of Datong, including Fengzhen, Jining, Zhuozi Mountain, and Qixiaying, is also clear and unobstructed. The repair team dispatched by the Zhangjiakou Engineering Section is currently rushing to repair the Datong-Kouquan branch line, which is expected to open to traffic soon.
    [Additional News] The first train pulled by the "Datong Liberation" locomotive, hastily assembled by the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot of the Ping-Sui Railway, arrived in Datong on the 30th of last month. When the train entered the station, more than a thousand employees of the station and nearby citizens, eagerly awaiting liberation, gathered to welcome it with unprecedented enthusiasm.
