    Southeast Liu Party Members Persuade the Masses to Break Old Habits and Plant Cotton
    [Jizhong News] Southeast Liu, in the Second District of Shenze, is a key village for production in the district. Under the active and vigorous leadership of Party members and cadres, it is now mobilizing the masses to plant more cotton and peanuts. However, the masses in this village have no habit of planting cotton and peanuts, and they have concerns, fearing that they will not have enough to eat or burn, or enough to hand over as public grain, and that it will be too much trouble, and that planting cotton will be a losing proposition in the future. In order to overcome the above difficulties, the following methods were adopted:
    First, Party branch members and cadres took the lead in reporting their own plans at various meetings, and linked them to the vital interests of the masses, publicizing the benefits of planting cotton and peanuts. For example, Liu Ruijin, fearing that he would not have enough to eat or burn if he planted cotton, planned to plant sorghum on his 1.8 mu of land; Party member Liu Minshan explained to him while working together, "It's more cost-effective to plant cotton than sorghum. Last year, I planted one mu of cotton, and even though it was hit by hail, I still harvested 150 jin. I only needed 70 jin of cotton to exchange for one dan of sorghum. You only get 4 dou from planting one mu of sorghum. Which one do you think is more cost-effective?" After Liu Ruijin calculated the accounts, he planted all 1.8 mu with cotton. In addition, they also held a forum for experienced old farmers, allowing those with experience in planting cotton and peanuts who had benefited from it to introduce their experiences and benefits. After the introduction, the farmers' concerns were dispelled, and they immediately reported the number of cotton and peanut plants they would plant.
    According to preliminary statistics, the reported number of cotton plants has completed more than four-fifths of the assigned task of 450 mu. Some households have already prepared the land and have found seeds from other villages or relatives' homes, preparing to plant.

    东南留党员说服群众
    打破旧习种棉花
    【冀中讯】深泽二区东南留，是该区的生产重点村，在党员、干部积极努力领导下，现正发动群众多种棉花和花生。但这村群众，过去无种棉和花生习惯，思想有顾虑，怕没吃、没烧、没公粮交，又怕麻烦，种棉将来吃亏。为克服上述困难，采用了以下办法：
    首先是支部党员干部在各种会议上以身作则，带头自报，并联系群众切身利益，宣传种棉和种花生的好处。象刘瑞金，因怕种棉没吃烧，打算把自己的一亩八分地种上高粱；党员刘泯山和他在一块做活时，对他解释说：“种高粱不如种棉花上算，象去年我种了一亩棉花，被雹子砸了，还摘了一百五十斤，只用七十斤棉花就换了一石高粱，你种一亩高粱才打四斗，你说那个上算呀？”刘瑞金算了帐，就把一亩八分全种上棉花。此外，他们还召开了老农座谈会，让种棉花花生有经验并得到实益的老农，介绍自己的经验和利益，经介绍后，打破了农民的顾虑，当场纷纷自报种棉和花生数字
    据初步统计，种棉自报数已完成分配任务四百五十亩的五分之四以上，有的户已收拾了地，并从外村或亲友家找来了种子，准备耩种。
