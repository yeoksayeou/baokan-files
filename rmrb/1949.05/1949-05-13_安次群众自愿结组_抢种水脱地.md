    Anci Masses Voluntarily Form Groups
    to Rush-Plant Waterlogged Land

    [This newspaper's dispatch] The masses in the Anci flood-stricken area are actively rushing to cultivate waterlogged land and sow field crops. Due to the drought and lack of rain, the waterlogged land is gradually drying out, and because it is the sowing season, the masses in the disaster area have temporarily suspended sideline production and organized mutual aid to carry out intensive sowing. According to statistics from nine villages in four districts: within four days, a total of 9,190 mu of sorghum, mung beans, corn, and rice were sown. After the representative from Ximaquan Village in the 11th District returned to the village from the county meeting, he convened a meeting of village cadres, farmers' association group meetings, and village meetings to mobilize the masses to organize freely and voluntarily to carry out rush-cultivation and rush-planting. Subsequently, the village cadres went to different areas to carry out liaison and grouping. After propaganda mobilization and the lead of the village cadres, a total of eleven groups were organized (each group with seven or eight people). Each mutual aid group specifically discussed methods for calculating work, working together, and compensating work. Because they are voluntarily combined for mutual benefit, they are highly motivated to work. Within three days, 1,380 mu out of the village's 1,590 mu of bare land had been planted. Hu Guanglin, director of the Yixuezhuang Farmers' Association in the 1st District, in order to motivate the masses in the village to organize and rush-cultivate and rush-plant, first mobilized the village cadres to form mutual aid groups. Nine people plowed 17 mu of land in one day and planted 8 mu of rice. They also plan to contract out work after finishing planting on their own group's land, which will not only help others quickly plant the fields but also earn wages to maintain their livelihoods, and drive others to organize and help each other rush-plant. In order to sow on time, the masses in Zhang Village in the 7th District mobilized the entire village to complete the task of building embankments and blocking openings to divert water into the river within three days, freeing up 1,000 mu of waterlogged land, and are now actively preparing to plant rice.

    安次群众自愿结组
    抢种水脱地
    【本报讯】安次水灾区群众积极抢耕水脱地，播种大田作物。由于天旱无雨，水地日渐脱出，再加正是播种季节，所以灾区群众都暂时停下副业生产，组织互助突击播种。据四个区九个村的统计：在四天内播种红粮、绿豆、棒子、稻子共九千一百九十亩。十一区西马圈村代表由县开会回村后，便召开了村干会、农会小组会、村民大会，动员群众自由自愿组织起来，进行抢耕抢种。随后村干又分头分片进行串通编组，经过宣传动员和村干的带头，共组织了十一个小组（每组七八人不等），并且各个互助组都具体讨论出计工、齐工、补工的办法。由于他们是自愿两利结合，所以干活情绪很高，在三天内，全村一千五百九十亩白地，已种上一千三百八十亩。一区义学庄农会主任胡广林，为带动全村群众组织起来抢耕抢种，首先动员村干结组互助，九人一天就耕地十七亩，种稻子八亩，他们并计划将本组地种完后，对外进行包工，这样既帮助别人很快种上大田，又能挣个工资维持生活。并带动起别人组织起来互助抢种。七区章村群众为按时播种，全村群众动员起来三天内完成了打埝堵口引水入河的任务，脱出水地一千亩，现正积极准备种稻子。
