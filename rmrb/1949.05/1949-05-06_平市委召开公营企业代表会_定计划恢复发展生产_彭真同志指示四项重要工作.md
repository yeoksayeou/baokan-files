    The Municipal Party Committee of Beiping convened a representative meeting of public enterprises to establish plans for the restoration and development of production.
    Comrade Peng Zhen gave instructions on four important tasks.
    The management of cities cannot be done using methods used for rural areas.
    Rely on the initiative of workers; workers should consciously work.
    Immediately establish workers' self-defense corps to protect their factories.
    [This newspaper reports] On the afternoon of the 28th of last month at 6:30 PM, the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of factory directors, managers, military representatives, and heads of labor unions from public enterprises in the city. Four very important issues were discussed. Representatives from eighteen units attended, including representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, the Bureau of Health, the Bureau of Education, the Bureau of Enterprises, and the Trade Corporation. A comrade from the Municipal Party Committee first explained the significance of the meeting: the Municipal Party Committee has a draft resolution on current work and a preliminary plan for production and labor union work, which has been approved in principle by the Municipal Party Committee, and is seeking everyone's opinions. Then, Comrade Peng Zhen emphasized to everyone that the central task of Beiping at present is to restore, transform, and develop production, and all other work revolves around this center. Currently, public and private factories in Beiping have not fully recovered and must be quickly restored. Some unsuitable and unreasonable parts of the enterprise organization should be transformed. He then explained several other issues in the Municipal Party Committee's decisions and plans.

    Regarding the problems in public enterprises. The main discussion at the meeting that day focused on four issues: 1. Formulate a one-year production plan. 2. Establish and improve factory management committees. 3. Strengthen factory security work. 4. Several worker welfare issues. Everyone engaged in heated discussions on these four issues.

    1.  A state of anarchy in public production can no longer be tolerated. The lack of planning in public factories is a manifestation of anarchy, and this mistake must be overcome in order to play a leading role in the economy. During the discussion of this issue, everyone agreed to make plans. Some factories had already done so, while others raised many difficulties. For example, the ice factory said: Our production is seasonal, and we can only work for six months a year, so it is difficult to make a full-year plan. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: The problem with public factories is a leadership problem. How to lead requires a plan. Progressive workers are already dissatisfied with this unplanned and anarchic situation. They say, "We really want to complete the task, but the leadership has no plan." This opinion should be noted. A plan must be made, and if the first one is not good, it can be modified at any time. No matter how many difficulties there are, it must be made. It is better to have a plan than to have none. What to produce? How much to produce? How much raw materials or equipment are needed? How to sell the finished products? Repairs and expansions must all have a plan. Otherwise, it is like a blind man riding a blind horse. Seasonal production should have even more planning. If you can only produce for six months, you must plan how to utilize labor and equipment for the other six months. Randomness and lack of planning are characteristics of the old-style rural small-scale production. The proletariat is planned. We cannot use methods of managing rural areas to manage cities and advanced industries.

    2.  Organizing factory management committees is the main form of following the mass line. Public factories must establish sound factory management committees, which is a good way to realize the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." Comrade Peng Zhen said: The main problem in the current public factories is how the leadership follows the mass line. During the takeover period, some cadres cooperated well with workers and former staff, some were average, and some had bureaucratic and commandist styles. Now, we must all improve and avoid bureaucracy and commandism, and follow the mass line. Our party is the party of the proletariat, and the New Democratic state is led by the working class. All public factories should organize management committees, which are democratic factory management institutions. The factory director or military representative, the party committee or branch secretary, engineers, worker representatives, and the head of the labor union should all participate. Worker representatives should account for half of the management committee. In large factories, worker representatives can be elected by worker representative meetings, and in small factories, worker representatives can be directly elected by workers. The factory director or manager is the natural chairman of the management committee. He is the person in charge of production in the factory, that is, managing the factory, and does not need to be elected. When there are different opinions, the factory director can make the final decision; if there is enough time, he can ask for instructions from higher authorities; if there is not enough time, he can execute the factory director's decision while reporting the different opinions to higher authorities. The management committee should discuss principles, plans, administrative intentions, system changes, labor organization, personnel transfers, and worker welfare. All of these should be made known to every employee in the factory. In this way, it is easy to gather the opinions of the masses of employees and to persevere. This is the main form of the mass line. The factory director is both a leader and a comrade. You are a worker, and I am a worker. We are all members of the proletariat. Employees should obey the factory director's guidance, and employees can criticize the factory director if he is wrong. The factory director should often call workers to meetings to solicit opinions and conduct regular criticism and self-criticism, and make changes based on opinions (including the production plan). Administrative leaders should care about the lives of workers, pay attention to the difficulties of workers, solve the problems that can be solved, and explain the problems that cannot be solved. The most important thing is that the production plan and work intentions should be made known to every worker and transformed into their own intentions and plans so that they can consciously strive for their realization. Administrative leaders in factories should often speak to workers and regard educating workers as their own task. The leaders must be responsible, take action, and speak often, using a few minutes before and after work to explain the factory's affairs simply and clearly to everyone, which is very necessary. The Kuomintang reactionaries are the enemies of the workers, while we are the workers. The people manage themselves. Therefore, our management methods are fundamentally different from those of the Kuomintang. They control and oppress workers, stand in opposition to workers, force workers to work, and do not want workers to understand. They pursue a policy of fooling the people; our leadership relies on the initiative and creativity of workers, and wants workers to work consciously, because the workers are ourselves. Except for the bad ones, the former staff of the factory are all our cadres. Administrative leaders must rely on the masses and activists, and everyone must unite like one person to improve factory production.

    3.  Factory security work is as important as production. Why is factory security work given such importance? Comrade Peng Zhen said: "If we work hard to produce but are numb and indifferent, we will be sabotaged. The fire in the tram company is a big lesson. After more than two months of efforts by the employees, the number of trams in service will increase to more than one hundred, nearly double the number in service during the Kuomintang era. The special agents burned fifty-eight trams for us at once. This not only resulted in a loss of property equivalent to about four months of Beiping's total tax revenue, but also reduced the daily transportation tools for citizens by forty or fifty trams, and affected the lives of workers. This sabotage by Kuomintang special agents is not only against the Communist Party and the workers, but also against all citizens. The factory is the life of the workers, the rice bowl of the workers, and the life of the New Democratic state." Comrade Peng Zhen said, and Comrade Li Baohua of the Municipal Party Committee added: "This incident proves that we have serious bureaucracy. On the day of the fire, five of the six inspectors on duty were Kuomintang members, and the other was also very backward politically. We were actually complacent and unalert, leaving seventy or eighty trams there to be watched by these six people..." Comrade Peng Zhen asked everyone to return and immediately review their own bureaucracy and immediately establish workers' self-defense corps, selecting active producers and politically reliable employees to organize. Wages should be paid for time taken away from work, and compensation should be given for shifts outside of working hours. At the same time, there must be various facilities to prevent sabotage. We had not given specific instructions to the heads of each factory regarding the protection of the factory in the past, and we are responsible for this. Therefore, we do not excessively blame the comrades in the tram factory for the fire. But if this kind of thing happens again, the comrades working in the factory will be responsible, and we will investigate the responsibility.

    4.  Workers' children should receive education, and each factory should set up a clinic. Comrade Peng Zhen attached great importance to the welfare of workers. He said that each public factory should set up a clinic, and several factories living together can jointly set up one. Large factories can also set up more clinics to ensure the health of workers. First, the education of workers' children (including staff) should investigate how many people need to go to school, first solve the problems of public factories, and then solve the problems of private factories. Public schools should try to accommodate the children of workers. If they are attending private schools, the government can be responsible for subsidizing their tuition fees. Representatives from the Bureau of Health and the Bureau of Education spoke on these two matters. The representative from the Bureau of Health hoped that each factory would write down its name, address, number of people, sanitary facilities, and nearby public hospitals, and submit them to the Bureau of Health for adjustment. The representative from the Bureau of Education said: There are now forty-five workers' study classes, and the fourth and tenth districts are doing the best. The Bureau of Education has prepared many teachers and has people specifically responsible for recreational activities and has organized sports teams and singing teams to go to various factories. The connection with the factories is not enough now, and it is hoped that each factory will often contact the fourth section of the Bureau of Education. All primary and secondary schools are preparing to admit workers' children.

    平市委召开公营企业代表会
    定计划恢复发展生产
    彭真同志指示四项重要工作
    不能用管理农村办法管理城市
    依靠工人积极性要工人自觉工作
    马上成立工人纠察队，保卫自己的工厂
    【本报讯】上月二十八日下午六时半，中共北平市委会召集了本市公营企业的厂长、经理、军管代表、工会主任开会。讨论了四个很重要的问题。到会有十八个单位，四十八人，市总工会筹委会、卫生局、教育局、企业局、贸易公司都派有代表参加。市委同志先说明开会的意义是：市委有个目前工作决定的草案和生产与工会工作的初步计划，已经市委原则通过，征求大家有什么意见。接着由彭真同志向大家着重说明当前北平中心工作是恢复改造和发展生产，其他各种工作，都是围绕着这个中心，目前北平的公营与私营工厂，都还没有完全恢复，须迅速恢复，有些企业组织中不适用和不合理的部分要加以改造，接着又说明了市委决定和计划中的其他若干问题。
    关于公营企业中的问题。这天会议主要是讨论四个问题：一、订出一年生产计划。二、建立和健全工厂管理委员会。三、加强工厂的保卫工作。四、若干工人福利问题。就这四个问题，大家展开了热烈的讨论。
    一、公营生产不能再允许无政府状态存在。公营工厂生产无计划是一种无政府现象，必须克服这种错误，才能在经济上起领导作用。在讨论这个问题的时候，大家都同意作计划，有的工厂已经作了，有的提出许多困难，如制冰厂说：我们生产是有季节性的，一年只能工作六个月，全年计划不好作。彭真同志指出：公营工厂的问题是领导问题，如何领导就要有个计划，进步的工人已经不满意这种无计划无政府状况，他们说：“我们很想完成任务，就是领导上没个计划”，这个意见很应该注意。计划一定要有，第一次订不好，可以随时修改。不管有多少困难，也得作出来，有计划总比没有强。生产什么？生产多少？需要多少原料或器材？如何推销成品？修理、扩充、都要有计划。否则，就是盲人骑瞎马。有季节性的生产，更应该有计划，只能生产六个月，就得计划另外六个月如何利用劳动力和设备。散漫无计划是旧式农村小生产作风的特点，无产阶级是有计划的，我们不能用管理农村的办法来管理城市，管理进步的工业。
    二、组织工厂管理委员会，是走群众路线的主要形式。公营工厂必须建立健全的工厂管理委员会，这是实现从群众中来到群众中去的很好的形式，彭真同志说：现在各公营工厂的问题，主要是领导上如何走群众路线问题，接管期间，有的干部与工人和旧职员合作得很好，有的平常，有的有官僚主义命令主义作风。现在要一律搞好，不要官僚主义、命令主义，要走群众路线。我们的党是无产阶级的党，新民主主义国家是工人阶级领导的。所有的公营工厂要组织管理委员会，管理委员会是民主的工厂管理机构。厂长或军事代表，党委或支部书记、工程师、工人代表、工会主任都应参加。管委会中工人代表应占半数。大的工厂管委会的工人代表可由工人代表会议选举，小的工厂工人代表可由工人直接选举，厂长或经理是管委会的当然主席，他是工厂生产上的负责人，就是管理工厂的，用不着选举。有不同意见时，厂长可以作最后决定；如果时间来得及，可以请示上级；如果来不及，可以一面执行厂长决定，一面把不同意见报告上级。方针、计划、行政意图、制度变更、劳动组织、人事调动、工人福利，管委会都要讨论，所有这些，要使工厂每个员工都晓得。这样就很容易把员工群众意见集中起来，又很容易坚持下去，这是群众路线的主要形式。厂长又是领导首长，又是同志，你也是工人，我也是工人，都是无产阶级的一员，厂长的指导，员工应该服从，厂长不对，员工可以批评。厂长要常召集工人开会，征求意见，经常进行批评与自我批评，有意见就改（连生产计划在内）。行政首长要关心工人的生活，注意工人的困难，能解决的问题就解决，不可能解决的加以解释，最主要的是生产计划、工作意图、要使每个工人都晓得。并且变为他们自己的意图、计划，才能自觉地为其实现而奋斗。工厂里的行政首长要时常给工人讲话，要把教育工人，看作是自己的任务。一定要首长负责，亲自动手动口，常常利用上工后下工前的几分钟，把工厂的事情简单明了地给大家说清楚，很有必要。国民党反动派是工人的敌人，我们则是工人，人民自己管自己。故我们的管理方法和国民党根本不同，他是控制工人，压迫工人，和工人对立的，强制工人工作，又不要工人明白，他们是愚民政策；我们的领导是依靠工人的积极性，创造性，要工人自觉地工作，因为工人就是我们自己。工厂旧职员除过坏的，都是我们的干部。行政领导要好好依靠群众、积极分子，大家团结得象一个人一样，才能把工厂生产搞好。
    三、工厂保卫工作和生产同等重要。工厂的保卫工作为什么提到这样重要呢？彭真同志说：“我们拼命的生产，要是麻木不仁，就要遭到破坏。这次电车公司失火事件，是个很大的教训。经过员工两个多月的努力，出车将增加到一百辆以上，超过国民党时代出车量近一倍，特务分子一下给我们烧了五十八辆。不仅损失了约等于北平四个月的税收总额的财产，而且市民每日减少了四五十辆电车的交通工具，工人生活也受了打击。国民党特务这种破坏行为，不只是反对共产党和工人，也反对全体市民。工厂是工人的生命，是工人的饭碗子，也是新民主主义国家的生命。”彭真同志讲到这里市委李葆华同志补充说：“这件事情证明我们有严重的官僚主义，失火的那天六个值班的检车员，五个是国民党员，另一个在政治上也很落后，我们居然高枕无忧地毫不警惕，把七八十辆车放在那里要这六个人来看…”彭真同志要大家回去之后，马上检讨自己的官僚主义，马上建立工人纠察队，选拔生产积极的，政治上可靠的员工，组织起来。耽误了工作时间，工资应照给，生产时间以外值班要给以代价。同时，必须要有各种防止破坏的设备，我们从前关于保卫工厂未给各厂首长具体指示，我们有责任，故电车厂的失火，我们不过分责备工厂同志。但今后再发生这类事情，工厂工作同志就要负责，我们就要追究责任。
    四、工人子女应受到教育，各工厂要设立医务所。彭真同志对工人福利问题很重视。他说每个公营工厂要设立一个医务所，几个工厂住在一块的，可以共同设立一个，大工厂还可多设立医务所，保证工人健康。工人（包括职员）子女的教育首先要调查有多少需要上学的人，先解决公营工厂的，后解决私营工厂的。公立学校要尽量收纳工人子女，他们如果上的是私立学校，公家可负责津贴其学费。对这两件事情，卫生局代表、教育局代表都发了言，卫生局代表希望各工厂把名称、地址、人数、卫生设备、附近有那些公立医院，都写出来交卫生局以便调整。教育局代表说：现在已有了四十五个工人学习班，四区、十区办的最好。教育局准备了不少教员，还有人专门负责文娱活动，组织了体育工作队，歌咏工作队，准备到各工厂去，现在和工厂连系还不够，希望各工厂经常和教育局四科取得连系，各中小学校已在准备吸收工人子弟入学。
