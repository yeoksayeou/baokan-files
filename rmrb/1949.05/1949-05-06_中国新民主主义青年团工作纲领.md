The "Working Program of the China New Democratic Youth League" was adopted by the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League on April 17th. The full text is as follows:

The China New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely fighting for the complete realization of New Democracy.

The task of the China New Democratic Youth League is to educate youth with Marxism-Leninism, unite the broad masses of youth around the Chinese Communist Party, and together with the Chinese people, fight to the end for the complete overthrow of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism's rule in China, for the construction of a New Democratic People's Republic of China, and for the complete liberation of all the Chinese people and all mankind.

The basic task of the China New Democratic Youth League is learning, and learning in combination with practice. It is necessary to systematically study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, which is the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and Chinese revolutionary practice, and constantly educate its members and the masses of youth from revolutionary practice; at the same time, it should use the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to unite and educate the entire generation of Chinese youth, and organize the broad masses of youth to actively participate in various movements called for by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government. The Youth League should link learning with the task of building a new democratic country, so as to cultivate them into the best assistants and reserves of the Chinese Communist Party through active participation in various revolutionary struggles, work, and productive labor.

The China New Democratic Youth League should carry out persistent work in order to cultivate from among young workers, young peasants, young soldiers, young staff members, and young intellectuals countless figures who are loyal to the cause of the working people, have modern scientific and cultural knowledge, possess a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and have a heroic and fearless character.

In order to achieve all these goals, the China New Democratic Youth League hereby stipulates the following working program:

I. Strive for the Complete Victory of the People's Revolution, Defend People's Democracy and Lasting Peace

(1) The Youth League must educate all young people to be infinitely loyal to the cause of people's liberation, not to fear any difficulties and sacrifices, to strive for the victory of the revolution throughout the country at present, and to be ready at all times in the future to defend the people's democratic regime of New Democracy with resolute and courageous combat, and to consolidate the interests of the working people.

(2) It is imperative to imbue young people with a spirit of courage and fortitude, to oppose the shameful acts of retreating, fleeing, and betraying the interests of the people, and to actively participate in the struggle against hidden enemies—spies, secret agents, and all conspiratorial saboteurs.

(3) Strive to learn military affairs, learn the great strategic thinking of Comrade Mao Zedong; familiarize themselves with revolutionary military science knowledge, and master modern weapons and various military sciences and technologies.

(4) Make every effort to consolidate the people's armed forces—the People's Liberation Army, actively participate in the construction of the people's navy and air force, fight to defend the people's democracy and lasting peace throughout the country and the world, and work with the democratic youth of the world and the people of the world to completely smash all the conspiracies and tricks of the world's imperialist war instigators to create counter-revolutionary war.

(5) The Youth League firmly opposes imperialism and loves its new democratic motherland, educates young people with the spirit of internationalism, opposes Great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. And unite with the Soviet Union, all new democratic countries in the world, all oppressed nations, and the progressive youth and people in all capitalist countries to jointly oppose imperialism and completely eliminate the remnants of fascism.

II. Actively Participate in Various Construction Works of the New Democratic State

(1) As the People's Liberation War is about to achieve complete victory throughout the country, leading the masses of young people to actively participate in the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production has increasingly become the most important task of the Youth League.

(2) The Youth League should mobilize all its forces to go to various work posts in the construction of New Democracy; participate in and assist the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government in carrying out various tasks, and give full play to the active and exemplary role of youth in the construction cause.

(3) All male and female members must do their best to engage in labor, and influence and guide all young people to actively participate in labor and production with their exemplary actions and positive work models. A social movement of "active labor is the most glorious, and not laboring is the most shameful" should be created among all young people, establishing a correct labor attitude, abiding by labor discipline, striving to learn and master various production skills, improving production, and developing enthusiasm and creativity in production.

(4) The Youth League should help the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government to promote labor mutual assistance and develop the work of cooperatives; oppose waste, promote thrift, improve technology, and carry out revolutionary competitions.

III. Educate Members and Youth with Marxism-Leninism

(1) The Youth League must widely, regularly, and systematically carry out the education work of Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, which is the unity of Chinese revolutionary practice, among the masses of youth inside and outside the League, so that they can gradually learn to use the dialectical materialist viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to understand the process of social development and the laws of development of the Chinese revolution.

(2) The Youth League should be responsible for carrying out universal political education work for all young workers, young peasants, young soldiers, young staff members, young students, and young intellectuals; through various methods, such as: meetings, discussion meetings, lectures, broadcasting, training classes, etc., to make them understand: (1) the revolutionary outlook on life and the world outlook of serving the working people; (2) the history of the Chinese revolution and the basic issues of the Chinese revolution; (3) various policies in the stage of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution; (4) issues related to the direction and organization of their respective work and business.

(3) The Youth League should run League schools, training classes, and youth art theaters for a long time to train propagandists of the Youth League and organizers of various work of the League and youth workers.
    The Youth League should publish its own newspapers, magazines, series of books, and literary works for a long time, and organize clubs and libraries.

(4) The New Democratic Youth League should publicize various natural science knowledge, and patiently explain to young men and women the harm of superstition and religion, and use all ways and methods to expose the falsity and harmful facts of superstition and religion.

IV. Learn Cultural Science Production Knowledge, Learn Business and Skills

(1) The entire young generation must shoulder the arduous task of building a new democratic country and transform China from a backward agricultural country into an industrial country. The Youth League must promote young men and women inside and outside the League to strive to learn modern cultural science knowledge and master various economic business and production skills.

(2) In factories, the Youth League should assist trade unions to carry out cultural learning movements, organize various study classes, noon schools, night schools, and newspaper reading and literacy groups, and run training classes to improve the cultural level of members and young workers, and learn the skills of technology and management of machines and factories.

    The Youth League should assist the government to actively carry out social education work in cities and villages, in order to eliminate illiteracy in a planned and step-by-step manner.

(3) The Youth League should help the People's Democratic Government to restore, improve, and develop schools, reform the old education system, and establish a new people's mass education system. Send its best members and staff to serve as teachers in schools. Try its best to help the government train various specialized technical talents such as engineers, doctors, agronomists, scientists, and teachers.

(4) In the attitude of learning, oppose "being miscellaneous but not precise," and oppose treating science with a "superficial" attitude. Every member must gradually become someone who has cultural and scientific knowledge, and a large number of people must fully learn and master specialized science.

(5) The Youth League should promote, help, and actively participate in the work of student unions, organize students' learning in various ways, and in the new democratic schools, should assist educational administration to establish conscious learning discipline, oppose phenomena such as randomly dropping classes, absenteeism, and laziness. Every male and female member should become a model of progressive thinking and excellent academic performance.

V. Strive to Realize Various Basic and Special Living Welfare of Youth

(1) The Youth League should, on the basis of the overall interests of the vast majority of the people, constantly pay attention to and strive to serve the immediate needs and special interests of the masses of youth. Such as ensuring and striving for the realization of the labor laws and land laws promulgated by the government, and realizing freedom of marriage, etc.

(2) Promote the spirit of youth's love of activities, unity, mutual assistance, and creativity, organize youth's cultural entertainment and sports activities, strengthen physical exercise, and establish various cultural, artistic, entertainment, sports and other groups.

    All of this must be well noted and implemented, so that the youth of New Democratic China become a perfect generation with an active and creative, lively and vigorous style and healthy physique.

VI. Lead the Work of Children and Young Pioneers
