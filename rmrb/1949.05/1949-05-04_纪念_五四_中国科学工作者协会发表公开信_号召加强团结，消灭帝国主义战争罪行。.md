    Commemorating "May Fourth"
    China Association of Scientific Workers Publishes Open Letter
    Calling for Strengthening Unity to Eliminate Imperialist War Crimes.
    [Our Newspaper] Today is the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. The China Association of Scientific Workers has issued an open letter to Chinese and world scientific workers, stating the wishes and unwavering confidence in victory of the association's 1,200 members. The letter first makes a historical exposition of the great significance of the May Fourth Movement's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal nature, pointing out that this movement cultivated and inspired a path for the development of democracy and science in China. In particular, the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party two years after this movement added substantial content and definite guarantees to this demand for democracy and science under extremely difficult and arduous conditions. The letter then points out that on the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, the strength of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the principles of New Democracy, has achieved vast and far-reaching victories. The letter is full of confidence, stating that today, when world peace and the development of the people are facing new threats, scientific workers are constantly voicing protests, which demonstrates the leap forward of the people's era. Scientific workers consciously adding their strength will surely make an effective contribution to reversing the brutal and reckless countercurrent of the imperialists, stabilizing world peace, and enhancing the great ideals and goals of brotherly friendship among the people of the world. The letter states: We should learn from the scientific workers of the Soviet Union, collectively, systematically, and harmoniously exerting our own strength, and not fail the responsibility that generations have entrusted to this generation of scientific workers. The letter finally calls out: "Progressive scientific workers all over the world, strengthen your unity and fight to eliminate the crimes of imperialism that endanger the historical progress of all mankind!"
