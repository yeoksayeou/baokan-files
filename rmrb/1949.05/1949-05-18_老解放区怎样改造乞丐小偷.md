How Did the Old Liberated Areas Transform Beggars and Thieves?
    Lǐ Huá

    Recently, the issue of transforming beggars and thieves has been under study in Peiping and Tianjin, which naturally brought to my mind the lovable old liberated areas. Anyone who arrived in the old liberated areas would always have a strong and fresh impression: "People do not pocket lost articles found on the road, and doors are not bolted at night." There were no beggars or thieves there, and the society was surprisingly peaceful and tranquil. In 1946, a foreign journalist arrived in Handan, the seat of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region government, walked around the streets several times, and went to a newspaper office to ask, "Why are there no police here?" "Why can't I see any beggars?" Of course, he would not understand the question; he did not know the great efforts made by the Communist Party and the people in this regard.

    The famous Peking opera "Chiye River" is a true story that happened in Shanxi. The protagonist was lured, threatened, and occupied by the landlord, leading to bankruptcy and eventually becoming a beggar. In Luergou Village, Lingshou, Hebei, there was a woman named Wang Yuhai whose husband was captured by Japanese soldiers, leaving the family without labor. The landlord took the opportunity to press for rent urgently. Her hope for life was completely shattered, and she became pessimistic and degenerate, becoming a hoodlum. The old society produced a large number of beggars and thieves, and then used the police to suppress them, maintaining a dilapidated social order; then some people pretended to be compassionate, providing relief to orphans and the poor, taking away a thousand from you and returning half. In this cycle, the number of thieves and beggars increased.

    The protagonist of "Chiye River" eventually turned over: the Communist Party led the people to implement rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform, and he recovered what he had lost and established a new life for himself. How many beggars in the old liberated areas have gone through this tortuous path. It can be said that without the transformation of the social system, beggars are difficult to eliminate. Wang Yuhai also found her due outlet in the new society: the democratic government helped her settle accounts with the landlord, reducing the high rent exploitation (this was in 1944, before the implementation of land reform), removing a major concern from her mind. The village cooperative also lent her a portion of grain in the form of credit grain storage, providing her with food. The village cooperative also bought a pig and entrusted it to her to raise, solving the fertilizer problem. Her hope for life was restored, and she allowed her three sons to participate in the work team and also set a production plan. That year, she harvested six *shi* and one *dou* (large *shi*) of grain, plus an additional income of three thousand yuan, making her able to eat and dress adequately.

    In Wangju Village, Lingqiu, Shanxi, there was a lazy man named Zhong Shengyou. The poorer he was, the less he wanted to work. When he was so hungry that he had no choice, he stole grain from Wang Hai, a farmer in the same village. Soon it was discovered, and his family of five was forced to flee to the border, wandering and begging. This happened in 1939. Later, Wangju Village became a liberated area, and people gradually understood the principle that "farmers all over the world are one family." Wang Hai automatically sent a letter, advising Zhong Shengyou to return home, and also lent him eight *dou* of "bottoming grain" (you cannot work on an empty stomach, and bottoming grain is prepared for consumption during production). Zhong Shengyou was grateful and desperately reclaimed wasteland for production, and his situation gradually improved. At this time, he further reflected on his past mistakes and quickly became an active member of various tasks in the village.

    The power of public opinion is very great. As the saying goes, "When a thousand people point fingers, one dies without illness." The social atmosphere can also change anyone's consciousness. Ge Cun, a famous labor hero in Longhua, put out a blackboard newspaper in the village with the aim of encouraging everyone to work hard. Whoever produced well would have their portrait drawn on the blackboard newspaper after discussion and decision by the village production committee, and their name would be written to call on everyone to learn from them. Whoever was lazy would also have a portrait drawn after discussion, but without their name. Everyone was from the same village; everyone knew everyone. The good ones worked even harder after seeing it, and the lazy ones were ashamed and corrected themselves. There was a lazy woman who repeatedly refused to change despite persuasion. Ge Cun asked the village cadres to help her with production, and she herself was too embarrassed not to work anymore. As soon as there was a slight change, the blackboard newspaper immediately praised her, and the lazy woman quickly turned into a brand-new person. The women in the village were not convinced and competed with each other, setting off a vigorous production movement.

    Here is another example of a hoodlum turning into a labor hero. Liu Shenghai, a farmer from Yujiage, Wuqi County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, was lured by the Kuomintang troops stationed in Wuqi before its liberation and became addicted to gambling and opium, quickly squandering his small family fortune, ending up without pants to wear even in winter. His wife scolded, and his children cried, and he was almost forced to commit suicide. In 1936, the Red Army arrived in Wuqi, advocating production and strictly prohibiting opium smoking. Liu Shenghai, an opium addict and lazy man, was criticized by the whole village and advised by the government. "Others are all for my own good!" After thinking for a long time, he figured it out. He began to be determined to quit smoking. During the day, when the craving came, he went to the fields to work; at night, when the craving came, he went to the fields to carry firewood. He endured like this for seven days and quit smoking. From then on, Liu Shenghai embarked on a new path. In 1941, he used the sixty yuan earned by his son working as a hired laborer to buy a donkey and began transporting salt to Huachi. Within a year, he earned another donkey. On the sixth day of the first lunar month of the second year, when others were still celebrating the New Year, he went to transport salt again. By 1943, he had bought six donkeys, a mule, and two cows through his own labor. He became wealthy through production and became a famous salt transport hero in the border region. He thought, "The government is helping us, and we should also help the government!" He was always ahead of others in paying public grain and performing duties, demonstrating the flesh-and-blood relationship with the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Government.

    The above is the path of the old liberated areas in transforming lazy people, beggars, and thieves. Beggars are created by the old society and are victims of the old social system. Except for a few bad elements influenced by the old society, most are working people who have gone bankrupt due to cruel exploitation. We must use production and labor to find a way out for them and allow them to return to the production front in the new society. Regarding the handling of beggars, we should not hold a smug view that "once a beggar, he no longer wants to be an emperor." At the same time, we cannot solve the problem by generously dispensing benevolence and relief, because that is passive and temporary, and at best, it is only a "good person's" "good intentions." Some of the beggars were formerly peasants who had drifted into the cities, and now they should quickly return to share the land and engage in production. Some landlords and rich peasants who have fled to the cities should turn over a new leaf and return home to share the land and engage in production. As long as they are diligent and law-abiding, the people will surely give them a path to self-renewal. Some beggars and thieves who have been in the cities for a long time can also participate in various labor activities. For example, the labor brigades and work-study schools and reformatories recently organized by the government have provided them with a place to settle down and transform themselves. For some hoodlums who are unwilling to engage in production, the government should force them to work. In short, now there is no food without labor, and there will never be so-called "equal distribution of land" in the cities. Only production can survive. Beggars and thieves should recognize this, trust the government, make up their minds, and transform themselves.

### 老解放区怎样改造乞丐小偷

　　老解放区怎样改造乞丐小偷
    李华
    最近平津正研究改造乞丐、小偷的问题，使我自然而然的回想到可爱的老解放区。凡是初到老解放区的人，总会获得一个强烈而新鲜的印象：“路不拾遗，夜不闭户。”那里没有乞丐和小偷，社会是惊人的安宁和平静。一九四六年，有一个外国记者到了晋冀鲁豫边区政府所在地——邯郸，在街上走了几个圈子，跑到一家报馆里问：“这里为什么没有警察？”“为什么看不见乞丐？”他当然不会理解这个问题，他不晓得共产党和人民在这方面所作的伟大的努力。
    轰动北平的名剧“赤叶河”，故事是在山西发生的一件真事。主人公被地主诱骗、威胁、霸占，以至破产，最后当了乞丐。河北灵寿鹿耳沟村有个叫做王玉海的妇女，丈夫被日本兵抓走了，家中失掉了劳动力。地主乘势逼租，急如星火。她的生活希望完全破灭了，悲观颓丧，成了个二流子。旧社会大量地制造了乞丐和小偷，然后用警察镇压他们，维持残破的社会秩序；又由一些人假装慈悲，恤孤济贫，拿走你一千，还给你半个。如此循环发展，小偷乞丐越来越多。
    “赤叶河”的主人公最后是翻身了：共产党领导人民实行减租减息与土地改革，他收回了失去的东西，建立了自己的新生活。老解放区有多少乞丐走过了这条曲折的道路。可以说：没有社会制度的变革，乞丐是难以消灭的。王玉海也在新社会中找到应有的出路：民主政府帮助她和地主算了帐，减轻了高租剥削（那是一九四四年，还未实行土地改革），去掉她一块大心病。村合作社又以信用存粮的方式，贷给她一部粮食，使她有了吃的。村合作社又买了一只猪，交给她伴喂，解决了肥料困难。她的生活希望恢复了，让三个儿子参加了拨工组，还订了一个生产计划。这一年她收获了六石一斗（大石）粮食，加上三千元的副业收入，作到了足吃够穿。
    山西灵邱王巨村有个叫钟生有的懒汉，家越穷，越不想劳动，在饿得没有办法的时候，偷了同村农民王海的粮食。不久被发觉了，一家五口被迫逃到口外，流落乞食，这是一九三九年的事。后来王巨村成了解放区，人们逐渐懂得了“天下农民是一家”的道理，王海自动捎了个信，劝钟生有回家，还借给他八斗“垫底粮”（饿着肚子不能劳动，垫底粮是准备生产时食用的）。钟生有感激之余，拼命开荒生产，光景逐渐闹好了。这时候他进一步反省了过去的错误，很快的成了村中各种工作的积极分子。
    舆论的力量是很大的，所谓“千人所指，无疾而死”，社会的风气也可以转变任何人的意识。龙华一位著名的劳动英雄葛存在村里出了个黑板报，目的是推动大家好好生产。谁生产好，在村生产委员会讨论决定后，就在黑板报上给他画个像，写上名字，号召大家都学习他。谁是懒汉，经过讨论也画个像，但不写名字。都是同村人；谁也认识谁，好的看了更加油，懒汉害羞，也就改正了。有个懒婆，屡劝不改，葛存请村干部去帮助她生产，她自己也不好意思再不劳动。稍有转变，黑板报立刻表扬，懒婆急转直下，很快变成了一个崭新的人物。村里妇女都不服气，互争短长，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的生产运动。
    这里还有一个二流子变为劳动英雄的例子。陕甘宁边区吴旗县于家圪＠①农民刘生海，在吴旗尚未解放的时候，被国民党驻军诱惑得狂吸滥赌，一份小小的家业很快耗光，落得冬天都穿不上裤子。老婆骂，孩子闹，他几乎被逼得自杀了。一九三六年，红军到了吴旗，提倡生产，厉行戒烟，吸鸦片兼懒汉的刘生海，受到全村的批评和政府的劝告。“别人都是为我自己呀！”想了好久，他想通了。开始下决心戒烟。白天瘾来了，白天去地里作活，黑夜瘾来了，黑夜到地里背柴。这样熬了七天，就把烟瘾戒掉了。从此，刘生海走上了新生的道路。一九四一年，他用儿子揽工赚的六十元钱买了个驴，开始到华池运盐。一年之间又赚了个驴。第二年正月初六，别人还在过年，他又去运盐。到一九四三年，他靠着自己的劳动买了六条驴、一个骡子和两头牛。生产发家，成了边区著名的运盐英雄。他想：“政府帮助咱，咱也该帮助政府呀！”交公粮，出勤务，他都走在别人前头，表现了和共产党、解放军、人民政府的血肉关系。
    以上就是老解放区改造懒汉、乞丐、小偷的道路、乞丐是旧社会造成的，是旧的社会制度下的牺牲者。除了少数为旧社会所熏染坏的分子外，大部是因残酷剥削而流于破产的劳动人民。我们必须用生产、劳动，替他们找出路，让他们在新社会里重回生产战线，对于乞丐的处理，我们不应当抱着一种什么“当了乞丐就不想作皇帝”的幸灾乐祸看法，同时，也不能用慨解仁、恩赐救济的方法去解决问题，因为那是消极的，暂时的，充其量也不过是一种“好人”的“好心”而已。乞丐中有些过去是流落到城市的农民，现在就应当赶快回去分地好好闹生产。一些逃亡到城市来的地主富农，应该洗心革面，回家分地生产。只要勤劳守法，人民一定会给予自新之路。有些久在城市的乞丐、小偷，也可参加各种劳动。例如最近政府着手组织的劳动大队及习艺所教养所等，已给他们设置了安身、改造之所。对于某些不愿从事生产的二流子。政府应强制其劳动。总之，现在不劳动不得食，在城市里绝不会有所谓“平分土地”、只有生产才能生存，乞丐、小偷们应该认识这一点，相信政府，痛下决心，改造自己。
