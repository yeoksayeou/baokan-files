Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 5th: TASS reports: The Democratic Bloc of Parties in Berlin unanimously approved the 1949 construction plan proposed by the Greater Berlin Municipal Committee at its meeting on April 29th. The plan stipulates that 222 million marks will be used this year to restore the economy, construct housing, and expand scientific and cultural undertakings. This year, Berlin's public enterprises will increase production by 17 percent, and the Municipal Committee will also supply raw materials, fuel, and electricity to private enterprises to improve supplies to citizens. The plan also stipulates the signing of trade agreements with the Soviet Union, the Western German occupation zone, and West Berlin. This summer, 65,000 workers and 35,000 children will go to sanatoriums and convalescent homes for vacations. Before this winter, 475,000 tons of coal briquettes and 250,000 cubic meters of kindling wood will be stockpiled. Greater Berlin Mayor Ebert delivered a speech at the meeting, stating that the Municipal Committee's plan for the winter of 1948 to 1949 had been fully realized. During this period, the Municipal Committee distributed a total of 1.2 million tons of coal and clothing and shoes worth 52 million marks to citizens, repaired 5,287 houses, and confiscated the property of fascist activists and war criminals, including 465 enterprises and 95 banks. Ebert emphasized that the reason why these successes could be achieved in Berlin's democratic construction was due to the active support given by the working people of the Soviet occupation zone to the democratic forces in Berlin, and the generous assistance of the German Economic Commission and the Soviet occupation authorities.
