Where Did Last Night's Gunfire Come From?
	Catching Bandits in Shijia Hutong
	[Our Newspaper] Gunfire was suddenly heard near Wangfujing, Beiping City, around 12 o'clock last night because a robbery occurred at the residence of the famous Tongrentang shop owner, the Le family, located in Shijia Hutong, District One. It is reported that seven or eight bandits had been loitering in front of the Le residence for several days, "casing the joint." Unexpectedly, their plot was discovered, and our Public Security First Branch was prepared. On the night of the 24th, as the bandits began their robbery, we immediately apprehended them with armed force. As of the time of this writing, five bandits have been captured. Details can be found in today's People's Evening News.

　　昨夜枪声何来？
  　史家胡同捉匪
    【本报讯】平市王府井一带昨夜十二时许突闻枪声，原因是住内一区史家胡同的有名的同仁堂店东，乐宅发生了抢案。据悉，匪徒七、八人于数日前即徘徊乐宅门前“踩道”，不料阴谋被识破，我公安一分局早有准备，二十四日晚在匪徒动手行抢之际，我即武装捕捉。截至笔者发稿时止，匪徒已有五名就擒。详情请见今日人民晚报。
