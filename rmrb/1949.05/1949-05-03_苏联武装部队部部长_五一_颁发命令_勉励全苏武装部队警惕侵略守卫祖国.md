Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 1st, TASS Moscow, 30th: Soviet Armed Forces Minister Vasilevsky's Order No. 33. May 1, 1949, Moscow.

    Comrades Soldiers, Sergeants, Junior Officers, Senior Officers, and Generals of the Army and Navy!

    Today, the Soviet Armed Forces are celebrating May Day with all our people – a festival showcasing the fighting strength of the working people of the world.

    Soviet combat personnel are greeting May Day with significant achievements in combat and political training. Following the instructions of our leader and teacher Stalin, the Soviet Armed Forces have successfully completed the winter training period and greatly improved their military technology.

    The Soviet people are commemorating this international holiday with labor achievements that the motherland is proud of. Inspired by the great ideals of Lenin and Stalin, and driven by the noble sentiment of Soviet patriotism, our working people have achieved remarkable successes in implementing the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan and are confidently advancing along the road of communism.

    The new enhancement of the socialist economy, culture, and the material welfare of the working people, and the further strengthening of our armed forces, are vivid proof of the constant concern of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the Soviet government for the prosperity of the motherland and for the continuous strengthening of its economic power.

    The Soviet people, engaged in building communism, do not forget the danger of a new war to be launched by the ruling circles of the United States, who are preparing for a third world war against the will of the broad working people. The recently signed North Atlantic Treaty, which seriously threatens the cause of peace, provides irrefutable evidence of this aggressive policy directed primarily against the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet government, representing the fundamental interests of the Soviet people, steadfastly pursues a policy of peace and friendship between all countries, and resolutely exposes the instigators of a new war. All progressive mankind agrees with the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy.

    The Soviet Armed Forces are always mindful of their task – to vigilantly safeguard the national interests of their motherland.

    In the upcoming summer training period, personnel of the Army, Air Force, and Navy must achieve new successes in combat and political training. Combatants of the Army, Air Force, and Navy must exemplarily observe discipline and develop their spirit of courage and perseverance in every way. All commanders must improve the training and education of their subordinates and perfect them.

    Comrades Soldiers, Sergeants, Junior Officers, Senior Officers, and Generals of the Army and Navy! On the occasion of May Day, I extend my greetings to you and congratulate you; to commemorate the international festival of the working people, I order: a twenty-gun salute to be fired in Moscow – the capital of our motherland, the capitals of the federated republics, as well as in Kaliningrad, Lvov, Khabarovosk and Vladivostok, Lushun, and in the hero cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.

    Long live the Soviet Union – the bulwark of peace and democracy in the world!

    Long live the heroic Soviet people and their armed forces!

    Long live our Soviet government!

    Long live our glorious Communist Party!

    Long live our leader and teacher – the great and beloved Stalin!

    Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union Vasilevsky (signed).

    苏联武装部队部部长“五一”颁发命令
    勉励全苏武装部队警惕侵略守卫祖国
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：苏联武装部队部部长华西列夫斯基第三十三号命令。一九四九年五月一日于莫斯科。
    陆海军战士、士官、尉官、校官和将军同志们！
    今天，苏联武装部队正与我们全体人民庆祝“五一”节——检阅全世界劳动人民的战斗力量的节日。
    苏维埃战斗人员正在以战斗与政治的训练方面重大的成就来迎接“五一”节。苏联武装部队执行着我们的领袖与导师斯大林的指示，业已胜利地结束了冬季训练时期，大大地提高了他们的军事技术。
    苏联人民正在以祖国引以为荣的劳动勋绩来纪念这个国际节日。在列宁斯大林伟大理想的感召下，在苏维埃爱国主义崇高感情的推动下，我国劳动人民在执行战后斯大林五年计划当中获得了卓越的成就，并且正满怀信心地沿着共产主义的道路迈进。
    社会主义经济、文化与劳动人民物质福利的新的提高，我国武装部队的进一步加强，是列宁斯大林党与苏联政府对祖国的繁荣、对不断加强它的经济力量，经常地予以关怀的生动的证明。
    从事建设共产主义的苏维埃人民并不忘记美国统治集团要发动的新战争所具有的危险，美国统治集团与广大的劳动人民的意志背道而驰，正在准备第三次世界大战。最近签订的严重威胁着和平事业的北大西洋公约，给这个首先针对着苏联而发的侵略政策提供了不可辩驳的证据。
    苏联政府代表苏联人民的基本利益，坚守不渝地奉行和平与各国间友好的政策，坚决地揭露新战争挑拨者。全体进步人类都赞同苏联这个爱好和平的政策。
    苏联武装部队随时都牢记着他们的任务——警惕地守卫他们祖国的国家利益。
    在即将来临的夏季训练时期中，陆空海军的人员必须在战斗与政治的训练上达到新的成就。陆空海军的战斗员必须模范地遵守纪律，以一切方法发展他们的奋勇与坚毅的精神。一切指挥员必须改进部属的训练及教育，并使之臻于完善。
    陆海军战士、士官、将官、校官、将军同志们！值此“五一”节日，我谨向你们致敬并祝贺你们；为了纪念国际劳动人民的节日，我命令：在莫斯科——我们祖国的首都，各加盟共和国的首都，以及加里宁格勒、罗夫、伯力与海参崴、旅顺，并在列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨等英雄城市各鸣礼炮二十响。
    苏联——全世界和平与民主的堡垒万岁！
    英雄的苏维埃人民及其武装部队万岁！
    我们的苏联政府万岁！
    我们的光荣的共产党万岁！
    我们的领袖与导师——伟大的和亲爱的斯大林万岁！
    苏联武装部队部部长、苏联元帅华西列夫斯基（签字）。
