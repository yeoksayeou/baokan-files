    Chapter One: The Incident
    Shen Yaozong, from the east of the village, always looked very dashing in his blue robe and black vest, with a watch chain hanging from his button. But now, seeing Hei Lao Cai and so many others crowding in, his face turned yellow with fright. He hurriedly took off his satin cap, bowing and scraping, offering them seats and telling Cui @lu to pour tea and offer cigarettes.

    Hei Lao Cai sat down in the master's chair and said, "No need to be so polite. Now that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are cooperating, everyone should unite to resist the Japanese. What do you think?" Shen Yaozong sat to one side, stroking his mustache, and replied, "Of course, of course. Now that the country is in crisis, we have to resist Japan! I have always advocated resisting Japan." Hei Lao Cai said, "That's good. Since we are all resisting Japan, we are all one family. Your defense corps and our self-defense force can be merged together; it will be easier to do anything if we are unified. What do you think?" Shen Yaozong disagreed in his heart, but said, "This…" He didn't want to say it out loud, so he pretended to cough, coughing three times, two coughs, coughing the words back in. Hei Lao Cai asked him, "What do you think of this?" Shen Yaozong said with difficulty, "This… it's good and all; but… I can't make the decision alone. Let's discuss it slowly."

    Hei Lao Cai saw that he was deliberately procrastinating and was about to speak when a fellow villager ran in to report: A gang of robbers had been spotted at Sun Gong Dyke, and they were shooting. Shen Yaozong and his defense corps looked at each other, not saying a word. Hei Lao Cai stood up and said, "Let's go take a look!" But Shen Yaozong said, "Shooting at Sun Gong Dyke has nothing to do with us. Let's mind our own business." Hei Lao Cai said strangely, "Mind our own business? What are we for then? If we don't protect the people, what are we holding guns for? If you are afraid of death, you stay at home, we'll go!" These words made Shen Yaozong lose face, and he said embarrassedly, "If you want to go, let's go together." Hei Lao Cai led the self-defense force ahead, with the village chief and the defense corps following behind. The group headed straight for Sun Gong Dyke along the edge of the marsh.

    At this moment, Niu DaShui panicked, touching his broom handle, and thinking, "Damn it! This thing is just for show, to scare people; if a real fight breaks out, it'll be a disaster!" He saw that he had quite a few grenades on him, so he hurriedly pulled Gao Tun'er next to him and asked in a low voice, "How do you use a grenade?" Gao Tun'er said, "Who's ever used one!" DaShui thought anxiously, "This is a real mess!" The northwest wind was howling, and DaShui was sweating all over. Looking at his cousin, his cousin didn't care at all, sticking out his chest, striding forward, with great vigor.

    When they arrived at Sun Gong Dyke, the robbers were gone. They circled around but couldn't find them. Shen Yaozong stood high on the "earthen ox" ⑦, pretending for a while, leisurely stroking his beard and saying, "Ha! Luckily we didn't run into them. Your grenades probably wouldn't explode, right?" Hei Lao Cai's eyes flashed at him, and he said, "What? Not explode!" He pulled the pin, and a grenade flew out, shouting, "Watch!" The grenade exploded with a bang, the earth flew high, startling the birds in the wild. Shen Yaozong was so scared that he rolled down, crawling behind the "earthen ox," not caring that his silk robe got dirty; he complained, "Why are you doing this!" The self-defense force clapped and cheered.

    Gao Tun'er, this simple-minded kid, rolled up his sleeves and said, "I'll do one too!" He followed the example and threw one as well, and it exploded. Shen Yaozong had just stood up and crawled down again, hurriedly saying, "Okay, okay! I know it explodes, don't hurt anyone!" Liu Shuangxi wittily blinked his eyes and deliberately raised a hand grenade, shaking it: "No, no, I haven't thrown it yet. Be careful!" Shen Yaozong had just gotten up and hurriedly grabbed his arm, saying, "Forget it, forget it, what kind of joke are you playing!" Shuangxi made a face, and many people laughed. Gao Tun'er patted Niu DaShui and said, "Hey, buddy, don't let your pistol go off!" DaShui touched his broom handle and couldn't help laughing. It was already getting dark, and the group returned to the village.

    That night, Hei Lao Cai sent someone to invite Shen Yaozong again to negotiate the merger. Shen Yaozong made excuses that he had caught a cold and sent his secretary to say, "It's okay to merge." Hei Lao Cai proposed that Shen Yaozong remain as his village chief, and the captain of the self-defense force would be sent from their side; the two sides would form a unified front, establish a mobilization committee, and implement the principle of contributing money, labor, and guns; for example, the guns Shen Yaozong personally hid should also be taken out to resist Japan. The secretary went back and told him, and Shen Yaozong didn't sleep all night. The next day, Hei Lao Cai and the others went again, and Shen Yaozong agreed to everything. During the merger, some of the defense corps members stayed, and some quit, and the rifles were redistributed; the pistol that the squad leader used to carry was now worn by Hei Lao Cai.

    Following this, Hei Lao Cai and the others went to nearby villages to mobilize the wealthy families to contribute their guns, and they also donated money to buy guns. The anti-Japanese self-defense force expanded, and there were more guns.

    Hei Lao Cai and his group's activities were learned by He Shixiong, who came up with a "devilish idea" and ordered Guo San Mazi, Zhang Jinlong, and Li Liuzi to lead a group of people, all carrying pistols, to suddenly come to Shenjia Village office, demanding eight hundred catties of "chao zhi gao" (chao zhi gao is a kind of cake like chicken cake). Shen Yaozong knew at once that they were there to cause trouble, so he deliberately went to report to Hei Lao Cai, saying, "Where can we get so much chao zhi gao? I can't handle this; Captain Cai, you take care of them." Hei Lao Cai was very angry and took Gao Tun'er and Niu DaShui with Shen Yaozong to the village office.

    In the office, Guo San Mazi sat in a chair, dressed in a Kuomintang military uniform, wearing a military belt, and with the old red collar tabs still pinned on his collar. Standing next to him, Zhang Jinlong was dressed in black plain clothes, his hair slicked back, and he was carrying two guns. A line of people stood next to them, wearing all sorts of clothing, all with guns, each with shifty eyes. Guo San Mazi saw that Shen Yaozong was leading in a big black man with bushy sideburns, followed by two simple-looking young men; he knew that the one in front with the pistol must be Hei Lao Cai, so he deliberately looked down on him and asked, "Are you Cai the blacksmith?" Lao Cai put his left hand on his waist, stepped his right foot on a stool, and leaned his elbow on his knee, saying, "I am Cai the blacksmith, what do you want?" Guo San Mazi said, "What do I want! Tell your village to prepare eight hundred catties of chao zhi gao immediately and send it to our regimental headquarters!"

    Lao Cai laughed coldly, saying, "The people can't even afford cornbread, and you want to eat chao zhi gao!" Li Liuzi said triumphantly, "We're all feeling hot, so we need to eat chao zhi gao!" Gao Tun'er said, "Humph! You're thinking too highly of yourselves!" Niu DaShui also mustered up courage, saying with a surge of energy, "Hmph, this is such a poor village, there isn't even a pastry shop, where would we get chao zhi gao?" Guo San Mazi's face darkened, and he said, "Stop talking nonsense! Are you going to send it or not?" At this time, Liu Shuangxi had called the self-defense force and many villagers, who were all crowded in the courtyard listening; hearing this, Shuangxi, this skinny guy, jumped up angrily and shouted to everyone, "Tell me, do we have chao zhi gao or not?" Everyone shouted in unison, "No!"

    Inside, Guo San Mazi's pockmarked face turned red, and he threatened, "Who's making trouble? This is Commander He's order. If you don't send it, come with us, and talk to our commander!" Saying that, he winked, and there was an immediate cracking sound, and a dozen pistols were loaded, with the hammers cocked, held in their hands. Gao Tun'er was anxious and hurriedly pushed the bullet into his rifle. The self-defense force crowded to the door, pulling the bolts with a clatter. Niu DaShui's heart was pounding, and Shen Yaozong secretly slipped away.

    The grenade exploded, scaring Shen Yaozong into rolling down.

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
　　第一回　事变
    村东申耀宗穿着蓝袍黑背心，钮扣上挂个表练儿，向来是很神气的。这会儿，瞧见黑老蔡他们许多人拥进来，可把脸儿都吓黄了；忙摘下缎子小帽，点头哈腰的让坐，又叫崔＠碌倒茶拿烟。
    黑老蔡在太师椅上一坐，说：“不用客气。现在国共合作了，大伙儿团结抗日，你们怎么着？”申耀宗坐在一边，摸着八字须回答：“没说的，没说的。如今--国难当头，不抗日也不行啊！兄弟向来就是主张抗日的。”黑老蔡说：“这就好。既然都是抗日的，咱们就是一家人，你们的保卫团跟我们的自卫队，可以合并在一块儿；统一起来，干什么也方便。你看怎么样？”申耀宗心里不同意，嘴上说：“这……”他不好说出口，就假装咳嗽，三咳嗽，两咳嗽，把话都咳进去了。黑老蔡问他：“这怎么样？”申耀宗为难的说：“这……好倒好；可就是……兄弟一个人也作不了主，咱们慢慢儿再商量吧。”
    黑老蔡见他故意推拖，刚想说话，有个老乡跑来报告：孙公堤那儿发现一伙劫道的，在打枪呢。申耀宗和他手下的保卫团都面面相看，不言声儿。黑老蔡站起来说：“咱们瞧瞧去！”可是申耀宗说：“孙公堤打枪，与我们没什么关系，咱们还是少管闲事吧。”黑老蔡奇怪的说：“不管？那咱们是干什么的呀？不保护老百姓，拿着枪干吗？你们怕死，你们待在家里，我们去！”几句话说得申耀宗脸上下不来，不好意思的说：“要去咱们一块儿去。”黑老蔡就领着自卫队走在头里，村长和保卫团跟在后面；一伙人沿着淀边，直奔孙公堤。
    这当儿，牛大水可慌了，一面摸着笤帚疙瘩，一面想：“坏了！弄这玩艺儿是作作样子，吓唬吓唬人的么；真打起来，可打个蛋呀！”他瞧着身上手榴弹倒不少，忙拉拉旁边的高屯儿，小声问：“手榴弹怎么个打法？”高屯儿说：“谁打过呀！”大水着急的想：“这可是作了蹩子啦！”西北风飕飕的刮，大水还一身一身的出汗。看表哥，表哥可满不在乎，挺着腰，跨着大步子，一股劲的往前走。
    到了孙公堤，劫道的不见了。绕了一个圈儿，也没找着。申耀宗高高的站在“土牛”⑦上，学了一会儿，逍逍停停的捻着胡子说：“哈！幸亏没碰上，你们的手榴弹怕不响吧？”黑老蔡眼睛对他一闪，说：“什么？不响！”就拉开线儿，一颗手榴弹飞出去，喊了一声：“瞧吧！”手榴弹轰的炸开了，土冲得很高，惊得野地里鸟儿都乱飞。申耀宗吓得滚下来，爬在“土牛”后面，也不管绸袍儿弄脏了；嘴里埋怨说：“你怎么闹这玩艺儿呀！”自卫队都拍手叫好。
    高屯儿这楞小子，挽起袖口，说：“我也来一个！”他照着葫芦画瓢，也摔了一个，也炸响了。申耀宗刚站起来又爬下，慌忙说：“得了得了！我知道响了就行啦，别伤着人！”刘双喜滑稽的眨了眨眼儿，故意举起手溜弹摇晃着：“不行不行，我还没扔呢。你们小心！”申耀宗刚爬起来，连忙拉住他的胳膊说：“算了算了，你这是开什么玩笑呀！”双喜作了个鬼脸儿，许多人哈哈大笑。高屯儿拍拍牛大小说：“喂，伙计，你的盒子枪可别走火啊！”大水摸着笤帚疙瘩，也忍不住笑起来。天已经黑糊糊的了，一伙人就回村。
    当天晚上，黑老蔡又派人去请申耀宗，来谈判合编的事儿。申耀宗推拖着了凉，打发秘书来说：“合了也可以。”黑老蔡提出：申耀宗还当他的村长，自卫队的队长由这边派；两方面结成统一战线，成立动员会，实行有钱出钱，有力出力，有枪出枪；比如：申耀宗私人藏的枪，也应该拿出来抗日。秘书回去一说，申耀宗一夜没睡着。第二天，黑老蔡他们又去，申耀宗都应承了。合编中间，保卫团的团丁，有的留下，有的不干了，大枪都从新分配；以前班长带的一支盒子枪，就挎在黑老蔡身上了。
    接着，黑老蔡他们到附近各村，把财主家的枪都动员出来，还捐款买枪。抗日自卫队扩大了，枪也更多了。

    黑老蔡一伙人的活动，给何世雄知道了，就出了个“鬼点儿”，叫郭三麻子和张金龙、李六子带一班人，一个个都挎着盒子枪，突然来到申家庄村公所，要八百斤“潮脂糕”（潮脂糕就是鸡蛋糕）。申耀宗一听就知道是来闹事的，故意去找黑老蔡报告，说：“哪儿去弄这么些潮脂糕？这事儿我办不了；蔡队长，你打发他们吧。”黑老蔡听了很生气，就带着高屯儿、牛大水，跟申耀宗到村公所。
    公所里，郭三麻子大模大样的坐在椅子上，穿着国民党的军装，挎着武装带，领子上还别着过去的红领章。站在他身边的张金龙，穿着一身黑的便衣，头发往后梳得贼亮，身上挎着两支枪。旁边站着一溜人，穿什么服装的也有，都拿着枪，一个个贼眉怪眼的。郭三麻子瞧见申耀宗引着个连鬓胡子的黑大汉进来，后面跟着两个土头土脑的壮小伙子；知道那头前一个挎盒子枪的，准是黑老蔡，就故意瞧不起的问：“你是蔡铁匠吗？”老蔡左手叉腰，右脚踏在板凳上，胳膊湾儿往膝盖上一＠，说：“我就是蔡铁匠，你怎么样？”郭三麻子说：“怎么样！叫你们村里马上准备八百斤潮脂糕，送到我们团部去！”
    老蔡吓吓吓的冷笑，说：“老百姓连棒子窝窝都吃不上，你们吃潮脂糕吗！”李六子得意的说：“我们都上火了，就得吃潮脂糕！”高屯儿说：“哼！想的倒不错！”牛大水也壮一壮胆，冒一股子劲说：“吓，这么个穷村，连个点心铺子也没有，哪来的潮脂糕呀？”郭三麻子脸儿一沉，说：“别废话！你们到底送不送？”这时候，刘双喜叫来了自卫队和许多老百姓，都拥在院子里听呢，听到这儿，双喜这瘦个儿气得跳起来，对大伙儿嚷着：“你们说，有潮脂糕没有？”大伙儿齐声喊：“没有！”
    里面，郭三麻子涨得麻脸儿通红，威胁的说：“谁在闹？这是我们何团长的命令。你们要不送，跟我们走，有话跟我们团长说去！”说着回头使了个眼色，立时喀嚓嚓一阵响，十来把盒子都顶上了子儿，大小机头张着，提在手里。高屯儿急了，赶忙把手里的大枪也推上了子弹。自卫队都拥到门口，哗啦哗啦的拉着枪栓。牛大水心里扑通扑通直跳，申耀宗偷偷溜出去了。

    手榴弹炸响了，吓得申耀宗滚了下来。
