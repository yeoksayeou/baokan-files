Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 21st: TASS issued a statement on the Greek question on the 19th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    For several days, American newspapers, followed by other foreign newspapers, have published news stating that the Soviet representative to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Gromyko, held talks with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Mr. Rusk and British Minister of State Mr. McNeil to discuss the inclusion of the Greek issue on the agenda of the upcoming Paris Foreign Ministers Conference.

    TASS deems it necessary to state that this news is inconsistent with the facts. The true facts are as follows:

    On April 26, Mr. Rusk and Mr. McNeil met with Mr. Gromyko and suggested an informal discussion of measures to normalize the situation in Greece, which has already arisen, and to stop the Greek civil war.

    In response to Mr. Rusk and Mr. McNeil's suggestion, Mr. Gromyko stated that if the U.S. and British governments suggest Soviet participation in stopping the Greek civil war and establishing peace in Greece, then the Soviet Union does not refuse to participate in this work. Mr. Gromyko stated that in normalizing the Greek situation, the recent peaceful statement by the Greek Provisional Democratic Government expressing its willingness to stop the civil war should be utilized.

    How to normalize the situation in Greece?

    Gromyko expressed the Soviet viewpoint

    In response to the suggestion by Mr. Rusk and Mr. McNeil requesting the Soviet government to state its views on measures to normalize the situation in Greece, Mr. Gromyko listed the measures that could be taken in this regard as follows:

    (1) Representatives of all countries call on the warring parties to cease fire; (2) Announce a general amnesty; (3) Stipulate general and free parliamentary elections, while the highest Greek institution handling Greek election work should include representatives of the Greek democratic forces leading the Greek People's Liberation Movement; (4) Representatives of all countries, including the Soviet Union, should supervise the proper handling of Greek elections; (5) Establish a joint committee of all countries, including the Soviet Union, to control the border between Greece and its northern neighboring countries. Mr. Gromyko stated that in implementing this control, it is necessary to announce the cessation of foreign military assistance in terms of manpower and materials to the Greek government, and it is necessary to stipulate the date for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece.

    Mr. Rusk and Mr. McNeil stated that they would study Mr. Gromyko's views on measures to restore normalcy to the Greek situation, and at the next meeting, they would state the views of their respective governments.

　　关于希腊问题
  　塔斯社发表严正声明
  　驳斥美英等国报纸歪曲报导
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社于十九日发表关于希腊问题的声明，该声明原文如下：
    几天以来，美国报纸随后是其他外国报纸上出现了一种消息，说苏联出席纽约联合国大会的代表葛罗米柯曾与美国助理国务卿鲁斯克先生及英国国务大臣麦克纳尔先生之间举行会谈，商讨将希腊问题列入即将来临的巴黎外长会议议程的问题。
    塔斯社认为必须声明，这种消息与事实不符。真正的事实如下：
    四月二十六日，鲁斯克及麦克纳尔两先生与葛罗米柯会晤，并建议非正式讨论使希腊业已产生的情势走入正轨及停止希腊内战的措施。
    葛罗米柯在答复鲁斯克与麦克纳尔两先生的建议时声称：如果美英两国政府建议苏联参与停止希腊内战和建立希腊和平，那么，苏联并不拒绝参与这个工作。葛罗米柯声称：在使希腊情势走入正轨时，应该利用希腊临时民主政府最近发表的愿意停止内战的和平声明。
    如何使希腊情势走入正轨？
    葛罗米柯表示苏联观点
    在回答鲁斯克与麦克纳尔两先生所提建议，即请苏联政府申述对于使希腊情势走入正轨的措施所持的观点时，葛罗米柯列举在这方面能够采取的措施如下：
    （一）各国代表呼吁交战双方停战；（二）宣布普遍大赦；（三）规定普遍与自由的议会选举，同时，在办理希腊选举工作的希腊最高机构中，应包括领导希腊人民解放运动的希腊民主力量的代表；（四）包括苏联在内的各国代表，应对希腊选举的正确办理实行监督；（五）建立包括苏联在内的各国联合委员会，以管制希腊与其北邻各国接壤的边境。葛罗米柯宣称：在实施这种管制时，必须宣布停止外国方面给予希腊政府人力物力上的军事援助，而且必须规定外国军队自希腊撤退的日期。
    鲁斯克与麦克纳尔两先生声称：他们将研讨葛罗米柯对于使希腊情势恢复常态的措施所持的观点，而且在下次会晤时，他们将申述他们各自政府的看法。
