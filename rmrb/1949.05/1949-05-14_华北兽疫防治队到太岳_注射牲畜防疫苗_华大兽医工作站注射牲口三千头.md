    North China Veterinary Disease Prevention Team Arrives in Taiyue
    Livestock Injected with Preventative Vaccines
    Hua Da Veterinary Work Station Injects 3,000 Head of Livestock
    [Taiyue Dispatch] The North China People's Government Veterinary Disease Prevention Team No. 2, consisting of sixteen members led by Captain Guo Zhai Lin, Deputy Captains Yin Shan Shu, and Guo Da He, arrived in this district on April 29th to carry out large-scale treatment and prevention work against animal plagues. The team brought with them a large batch of medications including bovine anthrax serum, equine anthrax serum, anti-hemorrhagic septicemia serum, anti-hog cholera serum, and attenuated rinderpest vaccine. The main focus is the prevention of anthrax (i.e., yellow disease) and rinderpest in cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules. They are also treating anthrax and hog cholera in livestock. Given the prevalence of rinderpest in cattle in many areas of this district, the team plans to widely inject cattle in epidemic areas with attenuated rinderpest vaccine to prevent rinderpest, and to inject horses, donkeys, and mules in epidemic areas with anthrax vaccine to prevent anthrax. On May 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, they conducted preventative injections in Dongguan, Nanguan, Xiguan, Shunxing Village, and Qinei, Yuezhuang, Yaotou, and Pingtou in Yangcheng, totaling 1,178 head of cattle, mules, horses, and donkeys. On May 7th, they departed for Beitou in the first district, Jiali village in the sixth district, and other villages to administer injections. They will soon travel to Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Jincheng, Qinshui, Gaoping counties, and then to various counties in northern Taiyue for treatment. According to the comrades of the epidemic prevention team, under normal circumstances, cattle injected will not contract rinderpest for one year, and injected horses, mules, and donkeys will no longer contract anthrax.
    [Report] The Veterinary Work Station of the Agricultural College of North China University provided free anthrax (yellow disease) vaccinations for farmers' livestock in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang in early April, totaling 3,183 head of livestock, and treated 360 sick animals. This work lasted for one month and achieved good results. During the injection period in the four suburbs of Shijiazhuang, yellow disease and other diseases were successively discovered in livestock in the eighth district of Pingshan and the fifth and sixth districts of Huolu. Upon hearing the news, the station quickly dispatched additional work teams to these areas to conduct livestock health checks, treatments, and preventative injections, which have now been fully completed. A total of 401 head of livestock were injected and 10 head of livestock were treated in the eighth district of Pingshan; 643 head of livestock were injected and 12 head of livestock were treated in the fifth district of Huolu; and 1,279 head of livestock were injected and 32 head of livestock were treated in the sixth district of Huolu. In total 2,323 head were injected and 54 head were treated. This was very welcomed by the farmers, and most farmers said: "Our people's government really cares about us. When our livestock get sick, they come to treat them and give them vaccinations to prevent the spread of yellow disease. Who cared about this in the past!"
