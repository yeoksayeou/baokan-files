Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Dentsu News Agency, Berlin: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany passed a resolution on the 5th, welcoming the four-power agreement to abolish restrictions on traffic, transportation, and trade between the occupation zones in Germany. The resolution declares that the four-power agreement is in line with the demands repeatedly put forward by the Socialist Unity Party for a long time, and proves that the agreement between the major powers that the Soviet Union has always sought is possible. The resolution also stated: The four-power agreement is also a clear rejection of the Adenauer, Schmidt, Reuter, and Ohler clique's plan for division. Now, the task of the German Economic Commission and the Frankfurt Economic Council should be to rebuild normal economic relations between the occupation zones. The resolution pointed out that the Allied countries are negotiating the German issue, and therefore, it is even more necessary for all democratic forces in Germany to unite, as the German People's Council has called for. The resolution finally stated: "We call on the people of Berlin to emphatically express their demand for the reconstruction of a democratic unity with Berlin as the capital of Germany. We call on the German people to implement their will, strive for a just peace treaty, strive for a unified Germany and the simultaneous withdrawal of the occupying forces."

    德统一社会党欢迎四国协议
    号召争取民主的统一
    要求占领军同时撤退
    【新华社北平六日电】电通社柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会于五日通过决议，欢迎四国取销德境各占领区之间交通、运输及贸易限制的协议。决议宣称，四国协议合乎统一社会党久已屡次提出的要求，并证明苏联所始终谋求的大国之间的协议是可能的。决议又称：四国协议同时是对阿登纳、与马赫，鲁特尔及欧勒之流分裂计划的一个明确的否定。现在，德国经济委员会及法兰克福经济委员会的任务，应该是重建各占领区之间正常的经济关系。决议指出，盟国正在谈判德国问题，因而，全德民主势力更有必要，象德国人民委员会曾经号召的那样团结起来。决议最后力称：“我们号召柏林人民着重表示，要求重建以柏林为德国首都的民主的统一。我们号召德国人民贯彻他们的意志，争取公正的和约，争取统一的德国和占领军的同时撤退。”
