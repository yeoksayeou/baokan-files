Yao Xijiao

Zhang Mingquan

Around late morning, I arrived at Liufuzhai, a small village on the south bank of the Wei River. At the entrance of the village office, the village instructor was introducing the situation to me when a woman pushing a small dirt cart came up from the village entrance. She had probably just returned from delivering manure. This woman was of medium height, with a dark face, looking thin but full of energy. She looked no more than twenty-four or five years old.

After she passed by, the village instructor told me that this was Yao Xijiao, the women's affairs committee member. I had already heard some stories about Yao Xijiao in the county. The county party secretary said, "She has been participating in agricultural production herself for several years. Last spring, she became a member of the women's association. This year, when the higher authorities proposed mobilizing 50% of the able-bodied women to participate in agricultural labor, Liufuzhai mobilized particularly quickly. Yao Xijiao played a significant role in this mobilization." My main purpose in coming was to interview her.

As the sun was setting, at the village instructor's home, Yao Xijiao, while braiding straw hat braids, began to talk:

"Comrade! Speaking of my participation in agricultural production, it's been five or six years already. I was only married into my husband's family for two months when Xiaoliushun's father came down with malaria. It lasted for over a month, in the sixth lunar month. There was no one else at home to work in the fields; the weeds were taller than the seedlings in the fields. If I didn't weed, who would? A new daughter-in-law of three months, carrying a hoe to the fields, of course, it was a bit embarrassing! But what could I do? If you don't weed, you don't eat!

"The first few times, I found Auntie San from the north courtyard to go with me, and I even had her carry my hoe for me. Later, I thought: Why have someone else carry my hoe? I haven't heard anyone say anything these past few days, so I carried it myself.

"When I was a girl at my parents' home, I also went to the fields during busy times, but I was young, and going to the fields was like playing, working for a while and then resting. Now that I was seriously working, how could I not be tired? Getting blisters on my hands was nothing, but when I got home, my arms and legs weren't my own anymore. I lay in bed, so tired that I couldn't sleep half the night.

"That winter, every family was short of grain. Xiaoliushun's father went to do small business. We were too poor to feed livestock, and even less grain to feed pigs. If the fields weren't fertilized, how could we grow crops? I turned it over in my mind several times before deciding to pick up manure myself.

"Was it better to go early in the morning or late? If I went to pick up manure when it was light, I was afraid people would laugh at me; if I went before dawn, I felt timid and scared. I remember the first time very clearly. I got up when the rooster crowed twice, quietly opened the door, first put the manure basket inside the door, and peered out. There was no one on the street, and I listened, but there was no sound. Once I made up my mind, I went to the street.

"When I picked up manure in the village, I didn't dare look outside the village, but I also wanted to see. One dark clump after another, it was so scary. I didn't dare go outside the village to pick it up, so I went home; when I got home, I spun another spindle of cotton before it was light.

"After picking up manure in the village for a few days, I said to myself: That dark clump is a tree, that dark clump is a tombstone, what's there to be afraid of? Scaring myself. Later, I slowly dared to go to the highway outside the village to pick it up.

"One day, I was coming back from picking up manure on the highway, and the sun was already turning red. A person was coming from far away, and when I looked closely, it turned out to be a distant nephew from my parents' home going to the market. I panicked at the time, wishing I could burrow into the ground. There was a forest on the left, and I thought: I'll go in and hide. Just as I was about to turn onto a side road, he called out to me, and my face turned red with shame. Slowly, I got used to everything. If I met someone who laughed at me, I just ignored it.

"You asked me how I persuaded the women to go to the fields? This year, after the March 8th meeting in the district, I discussed it with Comrade Wu from the district. I called together the six or seven women in the village who regularly participated in labor and gave them some praise and encouragement. They were very happy and told their stories, and I arranged for them to bring others along when they went back.

"The next day, I talked about this matter at the mass meeting and also asked Yucheng's mother, who was the best at regular labor, to speak. The response after the meeting was good. Liu Er, an old man from the east end of the village, said, "The Communist Party is going to change everything!"

"Who knew that the landlord spread rumors? Liu Xicheng spread the rumor, "The Eighth Route Army has so many tricks, women will be able to go to the fields in the future, and men will all go to be soldiers." Xiaoshuan's mother didn't sleep all night after hearing the rumors. The next day, she came to me, and I enlightened her for a long time and also severely exposed the rumor-monger. The landlord didn't dare to sabotage anymore.

"On the fifteenth day of the second lunar month, the county was repairing a bridge on the highway to welcome the passing of the People's Liberation Army. Huangqiao was five li away from our village, and the county government called on the people of our village to push bricks from the kiln north of the village to the bridge, ten yuan for each brick. I discussed it with the cadres and felt that this was a good opportunity for mobilization. Real and immediate benefits were even easier to mobilize than participating in agriculture. We went back and mobilized by area, and more than thirty people came, pushing and pulling. Some women pushed three times a day and earned thirteen hundred yuan. After pushing the bricks, we praised the active ones again.

"Then it was time to weed the wheat. First, the cadres set an example. Those who regularly worked and those who participated in pushing bricks last time were almost all mobilized to go to the fields. But among the women who had men at home, nine out of ten didn't listen to persuasion. They felt that last year, the higher authorities called for planting more wheat, and there wasn't much spring land left, not even enough for the men to plant. Why not take a break if they could? The second group leader said that an old, fat woman not only didn't listen to persuasion but also threw ash in her face. The old fat woman's family said, "We eat our own, we drink our own, whether we work or not is none of your business." I knew that her field wasn't far from my field, so I carried my hoe to find her. I said, "Old Fat Sister-in-law, I'm going to weed the field alone, it's so lonely, will you keep me company?" She said, "No, no, I have something to do at home!" I said, "Let's go, just this once." I pulled and tugged her, carried her hoe for her, and we went to the field laughing and talking. We brought her along like this several times in a row, and she automatically started weeding.

"Later, the women's association discussed how to mobilize all the women who weren't in the association and had men at home. Everyone felt that they were diligent and lazy differently. We picked the most diligent one, Feng Qifu's family, and started promoting it among the women. These days, some women are helping their men carry water to plant cotton.

"A few days ago, when we mobilized women to clear the village walls, something happened. A landlord's daughter-in-law, Little Hou, also joined everyone in reclaiming wasteland. After clearing for two days, someone said to her, "Your own land has been confiscated, and you're still reclaiming wasteland? Reclaiming for a year, you can only reclaim a chicken's butt." Little Hou went home and cried for a long time. I only found out in the afternoon and sent two people to enlighten her. The next day, she joined again. We are now investigating who sabotaged her.

It was dark, and another meeting of women cadres was held to discuss organizing plowing."

    天快上午的时候，我到了卫河南岸的一个小村子刘府砦。在村公所门口，村指导员正向我介绍情况，从村口上来了一个推着小土车的妇女。大概是刚送完粪回来，这妇女中等身材，脸黑黑的，长得很瘦气，一包包劲，看模样不过二十四五岁。
    她过去以后，村指导员告诉我，这就是妇女委员姚西姣。关于姚西姣的事迹，在县里我已听到一些；县委书记说：“她自己已经参加农业生产好几年啦，去年春天在妇会里当了委员，今年上级提出发动百分之五十全劳力妇女参加农业劳动，刘府砦发动得特别快，姚西姣在这次发动中，起了不小作用。”我来的目的，主要的就是访问她。
    太阳落山了，在村指导员家里，姚西姣一边编着草帽辫，一边谈起来：
    “同志！说起我参加农业生产，已经五六年了。我十八岁上嫁到婆子家才两个月，小六顺他爹就发起疟子。一发个把月，六月天，家里又无别人能下地；地里草比苗高了，我不锄谁锄？三个月的新媳妇，背上锄下地，该不有些不好意思！有啥法？你不锄你不吃！？
    “头几回都是找北院三婶子和我带伴去，我的锄也叫她替背上，后来我想：自己的锄为了叫人家背呢？这两天也没听见人说啥呀，就自己背起来了。
    “在娘家当闺女时，忙时候也到地里去，年纪小，到地里也象玩一样，做会歇会。这才一正经做起活，还能不累，手打泡倒没啥，一回到家，这胳膊和腿，就不是自己的啦，躺在床上累得半夜睡不着。
    “那年冬天，家家粮食不够吃，小六顺他爹，做小买卖去了，家里穷，喂不起牲口，喂猪吧，更没有粮食，地里没粪上，会打庄稼吗？我心里转了好几个圈子，才打定主意自己拾粪。
    “早起好呢？晚起好呢？天明了去拾粪，怕人笑话；天不明就去呢，心里又胆胆缩缩的。第一回我记得很清，鸡叫两遍我就起来了，轻轻开了大门，先把粪箕子放在门里，探着头往外望了望，街上没有人，又听了听，也没有动静，主意一定，就上街了。
    “拾到庄头上，心里不敢往庄外看，可是又想看看，一个黑椿子连一个黑椿子，怕的不行。我没敢到庄外去拾，就回家了；到家又纺了一穗子花，天才算明啦。
    “在庄里拾了几天，我自己给自己说：那个黑椿子是棵树，那个黑椿子是个碑，怕个呢？自己吓自己。后来慢慢的我也敢到庄外汽车路上去拾了。
    “有一天我从汽车路上拾粪回来，太阳已经冒红，对面远远的来了一个人，仔细一看，原来是娘家一个远门侄去赶集的。我当时心慌啦，恨不得钻到地里去，左边有个林子，我想：进去躲躲吧。正想岔路，人家招呼哩，羞得我的脸通红。慢慢的啥也惯了，碰见别人笑话两句，也当耳旁风啦。
    “你问我怎么劝着妇女下了地？今年三八节，在区里开完了会，我和区上吴同志商量了商量；回把庄上六村七个常年参加劳动的妇女，召集起来开了个会，表扬鼓励了一下。她们心里很高兴，都把自己的事迹说了说，我就布置她们回去带别人。
    “第二天群众大会上单讲这事，又叫常年劳动最好的玉成她娘讲了话，散会以后反映不错，东头刘二老头说：“共产党要把啥都变过来哩！”
    “谁知道地主造谣啦，刘锡成撒风说：“八路军点子真多，妇女将来能下地了，男人好都当兵去”。小栓娘听了谣言一夜没睡觉，第二天来找我，给她开导了半天，又把造谣的狠狠揭了一下子，地主不敢再破坏了。
    “阴历二月十五，县里为了迎接解放军路过，在汽车路上修桥。黄桥离这庄五路里，县政府号召俺庄上的人推砖，从家北窑上推到桥上，一个砖十块钱，我和干部们一商量，觉着这是发动的好机会；现实现利，比参加农业还好发动。回去分片一活动，来了三十多口子，推的推拉的拉，有的妇女一天推了三回，挣了一千三百块钱；推完砖我们把积极的又表扬了。
    “接着该锄麦啦，首先干部起模范，常年劳动的和上回参加推砖的，差不多都动员下了地。家里有男人的妇女，却十个有九个不听劝，她们觉着，去年上级号召多种麦，留的春地不多，还不够男人种的哩，落得歇会为啥不歇会？二组长说：有个老胖嫂子，不但不识劝，还把她碰了一脸灰，老胖家说“俺吃俺我俺喝俺的，做不做用你管理。”我知道她的地和我的地离得不远，我就背上锄去找她了，我说：“老胖嫂子，我一个人去锄地，怪孤星的，你给我做做伴吧？”她说：“不，不，我家还有点事哩！”我说：“走吧就这一回。”拉拉扯扯的替她背上锄，说笑着到了地里，就这样一连带了几回，她自动锄起来了。
    “后来，妇会里商量，到底怎样才能把那些不在会的有男人的妇女都发动起来，大家觉着，她们勤懒也不一样，挑了一个最勤的冯其福家里，就在妇女中宣传起来啦，这几天有些妇女帮她男人挑水种棉花了。
    “前几天发动妇女开砦墙子，还出了一个事哩，有个地主媳妇小侯来家，也跟着大家参加了开荒，开了两天，不知道谁说她“自己的地都叫人家没收了，还开荒哩，开一年，能开一个鸡屁眼大。”小侯来家回去哭了半天，下午我才知道了，派了两个人开导她，第二天就又参加了，这会正调查破坏家是谁。
    天黑了，又开了个妇女干部会，打算组织拉耧哩。
              一九四九，四，二十六日清晨
