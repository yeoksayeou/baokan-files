Supplementary Opinions on "Secrets to Planting Sz Cotton"

　　Seeing the "Secrets to Planting Sz Cotton" published in the People's Daily (see page 2 of this newspaper on May 13th), Comrade Chen Duzhi summarized his experience and introduced it to everyone, which is very good. However, we have the following opinions as supplements:

    First, the most important conditions determining cotton yield are water conservancy, soil fertility, labor, and variety. Based on what Comrade Chen said, we believe that his cotton field must have the conditions of convenient irrigation, fertile soil, and sufficient labor. Therefore, the yield per mu is as high as three to four hundred catties; this is not simply the effect of techniques or secrets such as sparse planting, branch removal, topping, and leaf removal.

    Second, under the conditions of convenient water conservancy, fertile soil, and sufficient labor, planting improved American cotton varieties allows cotton plants to fully develop, so a considerable degree of sparse planting is reasonable. Precisely because of sparse planting and full cotton plant development, branch removal, topping, and leaf removal become necessary and effective work. Comrade Chen's secrets are in line with scientific theory. However, what is the most suitable row and plant spacing? It should be determined according to local conditions and cannot be generalized. At the same time, branch removal, topping, and leaf removal should be compared with not doing these things in various ways to know the size of the effect.

    Third, after the long-term devastation and looting by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the North China cotton area generally lacks fertilizer and labor, and water conservancy conditions are also poor. The average yield of general cotton fields is less than one hundred catties of seed cotton per mu. Cotton fields like the ones Comrade Chen mentioned are really a minority. Therefore, this experience must be applied flexibly. Because most cotton fields lack soil fertility, if the number of plants per mu is less than 2,500, there is a risk of reducing yield. At the same time, in years when cotton plants are growing normally and there is not too much rain, branch removal, topping, and leaf removal are not necessary for Sz cotton, often wasting labor, accomplishing nothing, and even being harmful. Whether or not to top and remove leaves from cotton in various places should also be based on whether the cotton is growing too vigorously, making a rational choice, and should not be considered universally effective and mechanically copying this secret.

### 对“种斯字棉诀窍”的补充意见

　　对“种斯字棉诀窍”的补充意见
    看到人民日报发表的“种斯字棉的诀窍”，（见五月十三日本报二版）陈笃之同志总结他的经验，介绍大家，这是很好的。不过我们还有下列的意见补充：
    一、决定棉花产量高低的条件，最主要的是水利、地肥、劳力、和品种，根据陈同志所说的情形，我们相信他的棉田，一定具有灌溉方便、地力肥沃、劳力充足的条件，因之每亩的生产量，高达三百几十斤；这不单纯是由疏植、摘腿、打尖、打叶等技术或诀窃所生的效果。
    二、在水利方便、地力肥沃、劳力充足的条件下，种植良种美棉，因为棉株可充分发育，所以相当程度的疏植是合理的。正因为疏植和棉株发育充分，因之摘腿、打尖、打叶也就成为必要和有效的工作。陈同志的诀窍，是和科学理论相符合的。不过行株距究竟以多少为最适宜？要根据各地的条件决定，不能一概而论；同时摘腿打尖打叶，也要以各种不同方法，并和不摘腿打尖打叶的作比较，才能知道效果的大小。
    三、经过日寇蒋匪的长期摧残掠夺，华北棉区普遍的缺乏肥料和劳力，水利条件也很差，一般棉田的产量，平均每亩不到一百斤籽棉。如陈同志所说的棉田，实在是少数。因此这经验必须灵活运用。因多数棉田地力不足，如果每亩株数在二千五百棵以下，就有减少产量的危险。同时在棉株发育正常，雨水不太多的年份，摘腿、打尖、打叶等，对于斯字棉，都不是必要的工作，往往多费人工，徒劳无益，甚至反有损害。各地的棉花是不是要打尖打叶，也应该根据棉花的生育是否太旺，作合理的抉择，不能认为普遍有效而机械搬运这一诀窍。
