    The North China People's Government Implements Collective Leadership
    Practices Joint Office System
    Strengthens Supervision and Inspection, and Improves Work Efficiency
    [By Our Correspondent] Since arriving in Beiping, the North China People's Government has begun to implement a joint office system, which has proven to be an excellent working method for implementing collective leadership and division of responsibilities, strengthening connections, and adapting to the urban environment. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the heads of all departments participate in joint office meetings, focusing on studying and resolving the following issues: 1. Work issues of a comprehensive nature involving all departments; 2. Issues involving connections between several departments; 3. Central work and other important issues; 4. Situation and work experience reports, etc. Since its implementation, it has been consistently adhered to and has achieved considerable results. Important matters are raised for study at joint office meetings, and after decisions are made, each department implements them separately, reducing the time spent on sending official documents back and forth and making work faster than before. Certain specialized issues are prepared by the competent departments, which submit reports, allowing all departments to increase their understanding of the overall situation and better arrange their own work. The joint office meetings have also strengthened the inspection and supervision system, preventing work delays and drift, and improving work efficiency. In the process of implementation, there are still some shortcomings that need to be overcome. For example, sometimes due to insufficient preparation, problems are raised temporarily, and cannot be comprehensively and thoroughly considered, delaying time without resolving them. Also, for some specific matters, the competent departments do not consult with relevant departments in advance to reach a consensus, and temporary research wastes unnecessary time. At the recent joint office meeting, it was proposed to strengthen the organizational work of the joint office, to continue discussing issues that are not finished in the morning in the afternoon, without further delay, and to not rush to discuss issues that are not mature, but to continue research. When the time is right, they will be brought up for resolution. In this way, the above-mentioned shortcomings can be gradually overcome.

    华北人民政府贯彻集体领导
    实行联合办公制度
    加强了督促检查提高了工作效率
    【本报讯】华北人民政府来平后，即开始实行联合办公制，证明这是贯彻集体领导与分工负责制度，加强联系，适宜城市环境的优良工作方法。每逢星期一、三、五，各部负责人均参加联合办公，着重研究解决以下问题：一、属于全面性的各部门的工作问题；二、几个部之间互有联系的问题；三、中心工作及其他重要问题；四、情况及工作经验汇报等。自实行以来，始终坚持未断，已收到相当的成绩。重要事项，在联合办公时提出研究，决定后各部门即分头执行，减少了公文辗转互相送递所费的时间，办事较前迅速。某些专门问题，由主管部门准备材料，提出报告，使各部门增加了全面的情况了解，得以更好的安排本部门的工作。在联合办公会上，也加强了检查与督促制度，防止工作拖延自流，提高了工作效率。在执行中，也还有若干缺点，须要克服。如有时因准备不足，临时提出问题，不能全面深入的考虑，拖延了时间，却不能解决。又如某些具体事项，主管部门没事先与有关部门商谈，求得一致意见，临时研究耽误不必要耽误的时间，在日前召开的联合办公会议上，提出要加强联合办公的组织工作，上午讨论不完的问题，下午继续讨论，不再拖延，意见不成熟的问题不忙提出讨论，应继续研究。俟时机成熟，再提出解决。这样，上面所说的缺点当可逐渐克服。
