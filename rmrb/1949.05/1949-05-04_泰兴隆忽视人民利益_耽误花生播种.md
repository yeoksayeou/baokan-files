(Jilu Yu Telegram) Taixinglong Store neglected the interests of the people, monopolized the purchase of peanut seeds, and failed to complete the task on schedule, which affected planting. The administrative office allocated two peanut loans to the Ninth Special District Office, the first being 1.4 million yuan and the second being 1 million yuan, which were to be purchased by the state-owned Taixinglong Store. The Ninth Special District Office, the Ninth Branch, and the Industrial Department of the Special District Office were all concerned that Taixinglong would not be able to complete the task in time. In late February, they successively proposed that the agricultural sections, banks, or other stores of various counties should purchase a portion of the seeds. When this was raised to Sun, the manager of Taixinglong, Sun replied, "We can complete the procurement task without any problems." As of April 16, when it was time to plant peanuts, Taixinglong had not yet completed the task of purchasing peanut seeds. Because time was pressing, the store finally allowed Lusheng Store to purchase seeds on credit. However, it was too late, and the price of peanut seeds had risen from 13 yuan per catty to 24 yuan per catty. The allocated loan of 2.4 million yuan could only buy 100,000 catties of seeds. However, according to the Ninth Special District Office's calculation of 53,000 mu of peanut planting, with each mu requiring 10 catties of seeds (generally 10 catties of seeds is not enough), this only provides one-fifth of the required seeds, which greatly affected the area planted with peanuts. Based on the above materials, Taixinglong, in dealing with this issue, did not consider its own purchasing capacity, did not study the possible difficulties in the work and how to overcome them, and did not pay attention even after repeated inquiries from higher authorities, which affected the realization of this year's plan to increase the production of industrial raw materials. This is an irresponsible attitude towards the interests of the people and should be examined.

　　泰兴隆忽视人民利益
    耽误花生播种
    【冀鲁豫电】泰兴隆商店忽视人民利益，包揽代购花生种，未能按期完成任务，致影响了播种。行署拨给九专署的两次花生贷款，第一次一百四十万元，第二次一百万元，由公营泰兴隆商店负责购买。九专署、九分行及专署工业处，均恐泰兴隆不能及时完成任务，在二月下旬曾先后提出由各县农业科、银行或其他商店分购一部分。向泰兴隆孙经理提出后，孙回答“可以完成采购任务，毫无问题。”自四月十六日，已到种花生时期，泰兴隆还未完成购买花生种子任务。因时间迫近，该店始允许鲁生商店贷购种子。惟时已晚，花生种已由开始十三元一斤涨至二十四元一斤，所拨之二百四十万元贷款，仅能买种子十万斤。但按九专署五万三千亩的花生播种计算，每亩按十斤种子计算（一般十斤种子不够），仅供所需种子的五分之一，这样就大大影响了播种花生的面积。根据以上材料，泰兴隆在处理这一问题上，不考虑自己的购买能力，不研究在工作中可能发生的困难与如何克服困难，上级几次催问，仍未引起注意，影响了今年增产工业原料计划的实现，这是对人民利益不负责任的态度，应作检查。
