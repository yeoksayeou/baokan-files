Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 17th: I have just received here a congratulatory telegram from all the Overseas Chinese in Pyongyang Special City, North Korea, sent to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army at the celebration meeting for the liberation of Nanjing held in Pyongyang on April 30th. The original telegram is as follows:

Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army comrades:

At a time when the vast majority of good people around the world are holding peace conferences in Paris, Prague, and other countries, the million-strong People's Liberation Army of our motherland victoriously crossed the Yangtze River. With the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, it liberated Nanjing, the center of the Kuomintang's anti-people counter-revolution for 22 years, in just three days of combat. At the same time, it liberated famous cities and important towns in the vast area along the Yangtze River from Wuxi in the east to Anqing in the west, liberating the people of Jiangnan from a hellish existence. On the Taiyuan front, Taiyuan was also liberated in three days of combat, destroying the last lair of the local tyrant Yan Xishan. This series of great victories is the clarion call for the liberation of all of China and a powerful demonstration of the strength of the world's democratic camp. This victory, just as Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese revolution is a part of the world revolution," not only makes all the Chinese people rejoice but also gives great encouragement to the world's oppressed people and those who advocate peace and oppose imperialism.

The growth of the Chinese people's strength is also a reduction in the reactionary forces. And today, the reactionary institutions are not only being reduced, but are being fundamentally defeated. Chiang Kai-shek, the number one war criminal, can no longer maintain any semblance of order. These victories are the result of the joint struggle of the entire Party, government, army, and people in China for the past three years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The invincible People's Liberation Army is advancing with irresistible force. The Chiang bandit troops are terrified at the news and flee at the sight of it, with only surrender or annihilation as their options; there is no third way.

More than 40,000 Overseas Chinese in northern Korea were overjoyed at the news of this victory and are holding celebration meetings everywhere with extremely joyous hearts to welcome the liberation of all of China. Under the leadership of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we are determined to step up production and complete the two-year people's economic plan to consolidate the democratic base; raise our political culture; and, with the spirit of internationalism, unite with our international comrades-in-arms, join hands, and strengthen the democratic forces. We are willing to support you with sincere spirit, to fight to Guangzhou! Fight to Taiwan! Completely, cleanly, and totally eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang and liberate all of China.

Finally, we extend our highest respect and heartfelt congratulations to you!

Here we shout:

Long live the great leader and savior of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Long live General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live the victorious crossing of the Yangtze River by the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live the liberation of Nanjing!

Long live the liberation of all of China!

Long live the People's Democratic Republic of China!

　　平壤华侨开大会祝捷
    电毛主席朱总司令致敬
  　决心加紧生产支援解放战争
    【新华社北平十七日电】此间顷接获北朝鲜平壤特别市全体华侨四月三十日在平壤举行的庆祝南京解放大会，致毛主席、朱总司令暨人民解放军的贺电一件，原电如下：毛主席、朱总司令并转全体人民解放军指战员同志们：
    当全世界广大善良的人民在巴黎、布拉格和各国召开和平大会之际，我祖国的人民解放军百万大军，胜利地横渡了长江，以秋风扫落叶之势，仅三天的作战就将国民党二十二年来反人民反革命的中心南京解放。同时解放了长江沿岸东起无锡西至安庆广阔地区的名城重镇，解放了地狱般生活的江南人民。太原前线，也以三天作战解放了太原，摧毁了阎锡山土皇帝的最后老巢。这一连串的伟大胜利，是解放全中国的号声，是世界民主阵营壮大的有力证明。这一胜利，恰如毛主席说：“中国革命是世界革命的一部分”，不但使全中国人民欢腾莫名，并给世界被压迫和主张和平反对帝国主义的人民一个很大的鼓舞。
    中国人民力量的壮大，也就是反动力量的缩减。而今天反动机构，不但是缩减，而且是根本上被打垮了，蒋介石这个头号战争罪犯，再也不能维持一个什么局面了。这些胜利是中国人民三年来在中国共产党的领导下，全体党政军民一致奋斗结果。所向无敌的人民解放军，势如破竹的前进，蒋匪军闻之丧胆，望之披靡，只有投降或被歼，再也没有第三条道路。
    朝鲜北部四万多华侨，听到了这个胜利消息，莫不狂欢万分，正以极度欢乐的心情，在各地召开了庆祝大会，为迎接全中国的解放，我们在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府领导之下，决心加紧生产，完成二年人民经济计划，以巩固民主基地；提高我们的政治文化，以国际主义精神，团结我们的国际战友，携手并进，壮大民主力量。我们愿以真挚的精神，支援您们，打到广州去！打到台湾去！彻底、干净、全部消灭国民党残余的力量，解放全中国。
    最后向你们致以崇高的敬意和衷心的祝贺！
    我们在这里高呼：
    中国人民伟大的领袖和救星毛主席万岁！
    中国人民解放军总司令朱德将军万岁！
    中国人民解放军胜利渡江万岁！
    南京解放万岁！
    全中国解放万岁！
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
