    Hua University of Agriculture Helps Farmers Eliminate Pests
    [Shijiazhuang News] The pest control team of Hua University of Agriculture is helping farmers in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang to eliminate pests such as weevils and mole crickets. Around the 15th of last month, weevils were discovered in beet fields in Tazhong Village, Eighth District, and Liuying Village, Sixth District. The educational work station of Hua University of Agriculture stationed in the district immediately used pesticides to spray for the masses, but the effect was not significant. On the 21st, the university organized more than 50 people to work with the personnel of the Eighth and Sixth District work stations to manually capture and kill the pests. The effect was quite significant, and most of the pests were eliminated in just one day. In the process of pest control, the "trap-and-kill method" was used, that is, at night, small piles of green grass and tender leaves were piled up in the infested fields. At dawn, the pests were found eating the leaves in the grass piles, and could then be captured and killed. In addition, mole crickets are also a significant pest in the beet fields in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang. The university organized four pest control teams (each team with more than 20 people) to go to work. According to the experience summarized by each team: the most effective method is to irrigate the land with water. When the water is full, the worms will float out and can be caught and killed. It is also effective to mix arsenic trioxide with food and bury it in the soil to poison the worms after they eat it. (Kong Wen, Chong Li, Shu Ben, Zhi Da)

    华大农学院助农民灭虫
    【石家庄讯】华大农学院灭虫大队，帮助石市近郊农民扑灭象虫、地蚕蝼蛄等虫害。上月十五日左右，八区塔冢及六区留营等村甜菜地里发现象虫。华大农学院驻该区教育工作站当即使用药品为群众喷杀，因效力不够显著，二十一日该院即组织五十余人，会同八区、六区各工作站人员实行用手捕杀，效力颇大，仅一天已大部扑灭。在灭虫中，曾使用了“诱杀法”，即夜间将青草嫩叶，在有虫地里堆成几个小堆，天明时害虫却在草堆中吃叶子，即可捕杀。又，石市近郊甜菜地里，地蚕蝼蛄为害亦甚巨，该院即组织四个灭虫小队（每队二十余人）前往工作。据各队总结经验称：最有效方法是以水灌地，水满虫则浮出，可捉杀，如以砒霜混合食物埋土中，诱虫食后毒死亦有效。（孔文、崇礼、树本、志达）
