    Beiping Military Control Commission Notice (Tong Zi No. 2)
    It has been found that during the stay of our 41st Army in Beiping, some units rented civilian houses. When the army left, they issued IOUs for unpaid rent to the landlords. The Military Control Commission is now responsible for settling these rental payments. All citizens holding IOUs issued by the 41st Army should submit these IOUs to their respective district governments from May 1st to May 10th. The district governments should then compile these IOUs and bring them to the Supply Department of this Commission for payment. All citizens and responsible comrades of the district governments are hereby notified.
