Secrets to Planting Sizi Cotton
    Chen Duzhi

    I have been planting cotton for seventeen years, and for the past ten years, I have been planting Sizi cotton. This year, the government is calling on the masses to plant Sizi cotton. I would like to share my experience in planting Sizi cotton with everyone: what I am sharing is not general cultivation methods, but a few secrets related to quality and yield within the cultivation methods.

    First is Density: Sizi cotton should not be planted too densely. Originally, Han Lantian, a technician from the Cotton Experiment Station, told me that this cotton needs to be planted with 3,000 plants per mu. I planted 2,500 plants per mu, and for three or four years, I never harvested as much as others. Later, I changed to 1,500 plants per mu, and the harvest increased. This is because too much density prevents ventilation and light penetration. I investigated the cotton planted in Guan County, with 3,000 to 4,000 plants per mu, yielding at most only about 100 jin per mu, which is a result of being too dense. However, planting too sparsely also results in low cotton yields because the fruit branches grow too long, and when the frost comes, the bolls at the base of the fruit branches open, while the bolls at the tips of the fruit branches cannot open, leading to a smaller harvest. I investigated Heze, where only about 800 plants are planted per mu, yielding at most only about 200 jin per mu, which is a result of being too sparse. So, what is the appropriate density? In my experience, it is best to have about 1,500 plants per mu. If spot planting, a row spacing of 2.2 to 2.3 chi and a plant spacing of 1.7 to 1.8 chi is most suitable.

    Second is Removing Bottom Branches: The barren branches (also called vigorous shoots) at the base of Sizi cotton are more lush than other cotton, but the fruit branches at the base (also called “grinding bar rafters”) are weaker than other cotton. They should be completely removed when the plant is a little over one chi tall, removing up to a height of five or six cun. The bolls formed on these fruit branches are mostly stunted. The Administrative Office Farm conducted an experiment, and the cotton that did not have these branches removed had as much as 60% stunted bolls and immature flowers.

    Third is Topping and Pruning Leaves: When the cotton grows to the head of the first fu (around mid-summer), and you see the large plant with ten or so fruit branches, you can start topping. When topping, leave only seven or eight fruit branches, not too many, because if you leave too many, the upper fruit branches will not produce bolls, and it will burden the lower fruit branches, reducing boll production. The topping should be completed by the middle of the fu. By the Beginning of Autumn (Liqiu), you must be ruthless and top the tips of the fruit branches and remove the leaves on the old stalks. You should also break off the fruit branches that will not produce bolls. Any unopened buds after the End of Heat (Chushu) should be removed entirely. As the saying goes, “Flowers at the End of Heat do not return home.” Leaving them will only produce immature bolls, which will burden the older bolls and prevent them from growing large and opening. This will not only improve the quality and increase the harvest of the cotton, but also ensure that the cotton is picked cleanly by the time of the first frost, leaving no immature bolls behind.

    The above three points are the three secrets I have learned in my dozen years of planting cotton. Last year, I planted cotton at the Luozhai Farm in Qingfeng, using the above three methods of management. Sizi Cotton No. 2 yielded as much as 350 jin per mu, and No. 4 yielded as much as 380 jin per mu. Other aspects such as land preparation, fertilization, branch removal, and flower bud removal are the same as for other cotton, so I won't go into detail!

    种斯字棉的诀窍
    陈笃之
    我种了十七年棉花，而且近十年来种的都是斯字棉，今年政府号召群众种斯字棉。正好我把我种斯字棉得到的经验介绍给大家：我所介绍的不是一般的栽培法，而是栽培法中有关品质及产量的几个诀窍。
    第一是稀稠：斯字棉种的不要太稠了。原先棉业试验场的技术员韩蓝田对我说：这花每亩须种三千棵，我每亩种了二千五百棵，经了三四年，年年没有人家摘的花多。后来改了每亩一千五百棵，就摘得多了。这是因为太稠了，不能通风透光的缘故。我调查冠县种的棉花，每亩三、四千棵，每亩顶多只摘一百来斤，就是犯了过稠的毛病。可是种的太稀了也少出棉花，因稀了果枝发的太长，到下霜时，果枝根底的桃开了，果枝尖上的桃开不了，也是少收棉花。我调查菏泽每亩约只种八百来棵，每亩顶多只收二百来斤，就是犯了过稀的毛病。那么多稠才合适呢？以我的经验，就是每亩一千五百来棵，要是点种，是行宽二尺二三，苗离苗一尺七八为最合适。
    第二是摘腿：斯字棉根底下的荒杈（也叫旺条），比别的花茂盛，可是根底下的果枝，（也叫磨杆椽）却比别的棉花萎弱，应当在一尺多高的时候，把它完全摘了去，摘的高度须要五六寸。这种果枝不去掉结的桃也多半是僵瓣。行署农场曾作过一次试验，不摘腿的收的花竟有十成之六的僵瓣和嫩花。
    第三是打尖及打叶：棉花长到头伏，看着大棵发出十来个果枝了，就可以开始打尖，打尖时只留七八个果枝，不要多留，因为留的多了，上边的果枝不生桃，反累的下边的果枝少生桃子。到中伏尖就打完了。到立秋时要下狠心，果枝上的尖也要打了，老杆上的叶也要去了，看着生不成桃的果枝也要折了。到处暑没有开花的苞子，也要一概去掉。农谚云：“处暑花不还家”。要留也是生个嫩桃子，反来累的老桃长不大开不了。这样不但棉花的成色好、收的多，而且到霜降，棉花拾的干干净净，不剩一个嫩桃子。
    以上三项，是我十几年种花的三个诀窍，我去年在清丰罗寨农场种棉，就是用以上三个办法管理的，斯字棉二号每亩竟收到三百五十斤，四号竟收到三百八十斤。其他如整地、上粪、打杈、打花耳，都和别的花一样，不再说啦！
