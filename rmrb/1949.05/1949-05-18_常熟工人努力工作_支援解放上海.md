　　Changshu Workers Work Hard
  　Supporting the Liberation of Shanghai
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 17th] Revolutionary order in Changshu has been initially established. After the city was liberated on the 26th of last month, the Military Control Commission and the People's Municipal Government were established on the 29th as ordered. The power plant resumed supplying electricity the day after liberation. All sixteen cotton mills in the city are intact, and fifteen of them have resumed operations one after another. Six middle schools are conducting classes as usual. Workers throughout the city are now working hard to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Shanghai. Telecommunications workers have repaired the telephone lines to Suzhou and Wuxi, which were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, and restored communication. After repairing the roadbed and six bridges on the Xihu Highway, road construction workers also completely repaired all twelve bridges on the Changshu-Taicang Highway, which were also destroyed by the Kuomintang army during their retreat.

　　常熟工人努力工作
  　支援解放上海
    【新华社无锡十七日电】常熟的革命秩序已初步建立。该城于上月二十六日解放后，军管会及人民市政府于二十九日即奉命成立。发电厂在解放后的第二天便照常送电，全市十六家纱厂完整无损，并已有十五家先后复工。六所中学照常上课。全市工人现正为支援人民解放军解放上海而努力工作。电讯工人已将被国民党匪军破坏的通往苏州、无锡的电话线修好通话。修路工人在修复锡沪公路路基及六座桥梁后，又将常（熟）太（仓）公路线上的十二座桥梁全部修好，这些桥梁亦是国民党军在逃跑时破坏的。
