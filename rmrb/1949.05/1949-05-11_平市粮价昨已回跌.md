    The price of grain in Beiping already stopped rising and began to fall yesterday morning (the 10th). The average price of flour fell by 140 yuan per bag, and the price of coarse and fine grains fell by 2 to 4 yuan per catty. The main reasons for this were the falling grain prices in Tianjin and the suburbs, and the large-scale sale of grain by the city's trade company.

    平市粮价昨已回跌
    【本报讯】平市粮价昨（十日）晨已止涨回跌，面粉平均每袋落一百四十元，粗细粮每斤落二至四元不等，其主要原因为天津与市郊粮价均已下跌，及市贸易公司大量抛售粮食之故。
