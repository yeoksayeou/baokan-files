　　[Reported by this newspaper] By proactively paying attention to organizing the strength of the people and strengthening the work of eliminating traitors, some areas in North China have achieved preliminary success and experience in rural security work. Changzhi in Taihang, Weixian in Jinnan and other places have successively uncovered cases of Kuomintang armed secret agents plotting to organize riots. The Liangxiang area of ​​Chahar relied on the people to annihilate more than 500 hidden armed bandits and special agents. The Taiyue District strengthened militia work, organized village and township joint defense, and ensured the stability of rural production order during the spring plowing season. Since the beginning of spring, the activities of bandits and special agents in various places have proved that the dying Kuomintang reactionary rulers and some feudal landlords who are unwilling to bow their heads are still sparing no effort to use various despicable means to undermine the people's peaceful lives. For example, Daming County in Jinnan discovered that the Kuomintang's hidden bandits and special agents dispatched two special agents from Kaifeng to incite the masses to rob warehouses. Weixian confiscated several pistols from demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns. Laiyuan County discovered that the reactionary secret society Pujifo Association was plotting a riot under the instigation of the Kuomintang. Experience in various places has proved that strengthening the rectification and training of the militia is the first good experience in maintaining rural security. The Fourth Administrative Region of Taihang has paid attention to this work, using the slack winter season to organize militia rotation training, purify the militia organization during the training, and wash away the bad elements hidden in the militia. In Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Boai alone, 221 people were washed away, greatly consolidating the militia organization. After returning to the village, the trained militiamen re-sharpened their weapons, and many places re-established a joint defense patrol system. Therefore, the sabotage activities of various bandits and special agents in the area have gradually decreased. The second major experience in strengthening rural security work is to mobilize the masses to monitor, report, and punish the main counter-revolutionary elements, and to persuade ordinary idlers, thieves, and gamblers to turn to production. In Laiyuan, the truth about the reactionary secret society Pujifo Association's conspiracy to riot in the county was exposed to the masses with solid evidence, which greatly raised the vigilance and hatred of the broad masses of people against the conspiracy and sabotage activities of the reactionary secret society, making the saboteurs completely isolated and losing their ground for spreading rumors.

　　加强民兵工作  依靠人民肃匪
  　华北农村治安工作获得经验
    【本报讯】主动注意组织人民力量，加强除奸工作，华北有些地区农村治安工作已取得初步成绩与经验。太行长治、冀南魏县等地均曾先后破获了阴谋组织暴动的国民党武装特务案；察哈尔良乡地区政府依靠人民，歼灭暗藏武装匪特五百余。太岳区加强民兵工作，组织乡村联防，保证了春耕中农村生产秩序的安定。入春以来，各地所发生的匪特的活动情况中均证明，垂死的国民党反动统治者，及某些不肯低头的封建地主仍不惜以各种卑劣的手段来破坏人民安宁生活，冀南大名县即曾查出国民党的暗藏匪特由开封派遣两个特务煽惑群众抢劫仓库。魏县从回乡散兵中查出手枪数支。涞源县查出反动会门普济佛会在国民党指使下阴谋暴动。各地的经验均证明，加强民兵的整顿与训练，为维护农村治安的第一个良好的经验。太行四专区由于注意了这一工作，利用冬闲空隙，组织民兵轮训，从训练中纯洁了民兵组织，洗刷了隐藏在民兵中的坏分子，仅修武、武陟、博爱即洗刷出二百二十一人，使民兵组织大为巩固，受训民兵回村后都重新擦亮了武器，很多地方重新建立了联防巡哨制度，因此该地各种匪特的破坏活动已逐渐减少。加强农村治安工作的第二个主要经验是发动群众来监视、检举与惩办首要反革命分子，规劝一般不务正业的小偷赌棍，使之转入生产。涞源在群众中以真凭实据揭穿了该县普济佛教会反动会门阴谋暴动的真相，大大提起了广大群众对反动会门阴谋破坏活动的警惕与痛恨，使破坏分子完全孤立，失去了造谣活动的地盘。
