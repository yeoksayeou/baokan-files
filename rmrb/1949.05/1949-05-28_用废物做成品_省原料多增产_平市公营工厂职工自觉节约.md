  　Employees of Public Factories in Beiping Consciously Practice Thrift
    [This newspaper reports] The vast number of employees in more than thirty state-owned and public factories in Beiping are taking a master's attitude in cherishing the factory and saving raw materials. In April, in order to welcome the first "May Day" Labor Day after liberation, the employees of various factories put forward the slogan of saving raw materials, materials, and fuel, and achieved considerable results. Employees of the Highway Bureau Automobile Factory used old and broken equipment to assemble a "May Day" special automobile. After the Liulihe Cement Plant started operations in mid-April, it saved more than 300 kilograms of gasoline and more than 62,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the production of cement, raw materials, and pulverized coal alone within one month. In the process of making summer clothes, the workers in the tailoring department of the Clothing Factory carefully arranged the patterns and tried to make full use of cloth strips and corners. They used 14,143,000 square feet of cloth to complete the number of summer clothes that should be made (guaranteeing sufficient size) and also saved 273,185 square feet of cloth of various colors. The fourth sewing team of the factory saved 366 spools of thread, which could make more than a thousand sets of clothes. Before and after the liberation, the 409 Automobile Repair Factory needed four gallons of gasoline to overhaul a car, but since April, the amount of gasoline used has been reduced to two gallons. The factory overhauled 116 cars, saving 232 gallons of gasoline. Zhong Shoupeng, a lead printing worker at the People's Printing Factory, picked up scrap lead that had been thrown into the pile of waste paper long ago and used it as raw material. The washing team of the factory saved more than 1,000 catties of salty flour in two months.

    On the 18th of this month, Comrade Bo Yibo, Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CPC, put forward a loud call for thrift at the welcoming meeting of the North China Workers' Congress. The employees of various factories responded enthusiastically, held meetings to review whether there were any wasteful phenomena in the past, summarized past thrift achievements, and discussed and formulated thrift plans for each production unit or individual. The employees of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory first reviewed the phenomena of wasting time and manpower in the past, and formulated a thrift plan, stipulating that cotton silk for wiping hands should not be discarded after use, but should be reused after drying. Zhou Yueting, a carpenter at the factory, often looked for old nails everywhere in his spare time, hoping not to buy new nails. All the employees of the Ping Municipal Public Automobile Repair Factory first studied Comrade Bo Yibo's thrift report for two days, and then formulated a plan to make full use of waste materials, not to waste a single screw, and to use fire alkali instead of gasoline when washing machines. In order to respond to the call for thrift, the workers of the cooking department of the People's Paper Mill collected the nails on various waste boxes in their spare time and sent them to the carpentry department. They collected 28 catties in one week, saving more than 10,000 yuan in People's currency. The papermaking department also paid attention to reducing losses. In the past, 100 pounds of paper were lost every day, but now it has been reduced by half.

  　平市公营工厂职工自觉节约
    【本报讯】北平市三十多个国营公营工厂的广大职工，以主人翁的态度爱护工厂节约原料。四月份各厂职工为了迎接解放后第一个“五一”劳动节，曾提出节省原料、材料及燃料的口号，获得相当成绩。公路局汽车厂职工曾用破旧器材装成一部“五一”专号汽车。琉璃河水泥厂四月中旬开工后，一个月内仅水泥、生料，磨煤三项生产即节省汽油三百余公斤，电六万两千余度。被服厂制做夏服中，裁剪部工人细心安排样板，尽量利用布条布角。她们以一千四百一十四万三千余方尺布料，完成应做的夏服数字（保证足够尺寸），还节省各色布二十七万三千一百八十五方尺。该厂第四缝级部共节省线三百六十六支，能做衣服千余套。四○九汽车修理厂在解放前后，大修一辆车需汽油四加仑，自四月份起，所用汽油减至两加仑。该厂大修一百十六辆汽车，节省汽油达二百三十二加仑。人民印制厂的铅印工人钟寿朋把很早扔到烂纸堆里的碎铅捡起当做原料。该厂洗濯组两个月节省咸面一千多斤。
    本月十八日，中共华北局书记薄一波同志在欢迎华北职工代表大会上，响亮的提出节约的号召，各工厂职工热烈响应，分别开会检讨过去是否还有浪费现象，总结过去节约成绩，讨论制订各生产单位或个人的节约计划。华北农业机器厂职工首先检讨了过去浪费时间、人力的现象，并制定了节约计划，规定擦手的棉丝用过后不要丢了，等晒干以后再用。该厂木工周月亭经常在工余时间到处寻找旧钉子用，希望作到不买新钉子。平市公共汽车修理厂全体职工先学习了两天薄一波同志的节约报告，然后制订计划，尽量利用废料，不使一个螺丝浪费，洗机器时用火咸代替汽油。人民造纸厂蒸煮部工人为响应节约号召，在工余时间将各种废箱上的钉子搜集起来送到木工部，一个星期搜集了二十八斤，节省人民券一万多元。抄纸部也注意了减少损失，过去每日损纸一百磅，现已减少了一半。
