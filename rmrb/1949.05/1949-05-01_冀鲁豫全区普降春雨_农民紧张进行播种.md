    The Entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    Experiences General Spring Rain
    Farmers Busily Sowing Seeds
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] Around the 24th of this month, the entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan region experienced a general spring rain. The timely rain has delighted farmers everywhere, who are busily sowing seeds. Since the Qingming Festival, wheat seedlings in various locations have been weeded once, and in some cases even three times, awaiting the arrival of spring rain. Especially in the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Seventh Administrative Offices, where snow fell at the end of last month, damaging the wheat and fostering insect pests, farmers were even more eager for rain to fall quickly. Some had already prepared peanuts, cotton seeds, and sorghum, waiting only for the spring rain to begin sowing everything. On the 24th, the wind direction changed abruptly, thick clouds gathered, and the entire region experienced a general spring rain. Most areas received rain for a full day and night, with thorough saturation. Some areas received three to four fingers of rainfall. The farmers were overjoyed and are busily sowing seeds. An old farmer in a village near Heze said, "Oh, this is great. Each mu of seedlings can yield at least a hundred or so jin! This way, there will be fewer insect pests." Villages near Heze have finished planting peanuts and sorghum. The Fourth Administrative Office recently loaned out 800 jin of 'Si' cotton, and a large portion has been planted in just a few days. Other areas, thanks to the timely spring rain, are also actively sowing seeds.

    冀鲁豫全区
    普降春雨
    农民紧张进行播种
    【冀鲁豫电】本月二十四日前后，冀鲁豫全区普降春雨，甘霖及时，各地农民欣喜播种。自清明以来，各地麦苗都锄了一遍，有的甚至锄到三遍，等待春雨的到来。尤其是四、五、八、七专署由于上月底降过雪，麦子受了损害，又加虫害滋长，农民更盼望赶快降雨。有些已将花生、棉种、高粱准备好，只等春雨一降，就可全部下种。到了二十四日，各地风向骤变，浓云布满，全区普降春雨，大部分地区下了一天一夜，雨水很透，部分地区有三、四指。农民们欢欣万状，紧张进行播种。菏泽附近村中的一个老农说：“哟，这回可好了，每亩苗至少可收百十来斤啦！这一来，虫灾也可少些啦”。菏泽附近村庄，花生、高粱都种完了。四专署于最近贷出的八百斤斯字棉，几天就种了一大半，其他地区，由于春雨及时，也都纷纷下种。
