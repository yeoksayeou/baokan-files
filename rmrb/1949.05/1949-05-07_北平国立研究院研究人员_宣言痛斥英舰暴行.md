Researchers at the National Academy of Peiping Issue Declaration Denouncing Atrocities of British Warships

[This newspaper] report: The Research Council and the Assistant Researchers' Union of the National Academy of Peiping have jointly issued a declaration regarding the atrocities of British warships entering the Yangtze River and bombarding the People's Liberation Army positions. The declaration reads as follows: "This time, British warships intruded into our country's Yangtze River, attempting to obstruct our people's revolutionary cause, causing huge losses to our People's Liberation Army crossing the river, which has aroused public indignation. Modern imperialism was initiated by the British Empire. A hundred years ago, during the Opium War, the British Empire, driven by extremely shameful motives, invaded our sovereignty, plundered our land, and trapped our country in the shackles of unequal treaties. Now, after our victory in the eight-year anti-Japanese war, British imperialism has become even more intensified, colluding with the traitorous Nanjing government, intruding into our inland rivers, and bombarding our people. We deeply hate this kind of imperialist aggression and the Nanjing government's traitorous behavior. The colleagues of this council wish that all our compatriots will raise their vigilance, strive hard, so as to eliminate the remnants of the traitorous government as soon as possible, and eliminate the aggressive attempts of the British Empire and other imperialist countries in our country, so that the independence and freedom of our nation can be realized, and the foundation of world peace can be laid. This declaration is hereby made."
