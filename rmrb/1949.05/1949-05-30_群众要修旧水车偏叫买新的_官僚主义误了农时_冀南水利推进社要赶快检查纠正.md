[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Society, due to its serious bureaucratic work style, coupled with a purely profit-driven perspective, failing to conduct investigations and research and disregarding the needs of the masses, has engaged in blind operation, causing undue losses to water conservancy construction work. The society was established in January, with a loan of 2.5 billion yuan (Jicha,冀钞) from the bank as capital. It determined its policy to focus on promoting the sale of new waterwheels, with loan assistance for repairing old waterwheels as a secondary task. However, in recent months, only six of the new waterwheels ordered have been loaned out in the Third Special District. Only a few have been loaned out in the Fourth Special District, and only 200 million yuan has been loaned out. Despite possessing a large amount of capital, the spring repair season has been wasted, failing to play its due role in promoting water conservancy in the fourteen counties near the river.

In the fourteen counties near the river in the Jinnan area, there are 16,000 waterwheels. Due to years of neglect of repairs and insufficient attention to waterwheel protection during the land reform, the damage is very severe. Less than 10,000 of all waterwheels are usable. Currently, the purchasing power of the masses is low. A loan to buy a new waterwheel requires more than 1,000 catties of rice, while repairing an old waterwheel only requires 200,000 yuan at the time. The demand of the masses is to repair and restore a large number of old waterwheels, and then purchase new waterwheels after the purchasing power improves. Based on this reality, the operating policy of the Promotion Society should be to focus on repairing old waterwheels, combined with lending and selling new waterwheels. However, the society planned to sell 2,000 new waterwheels in the first half of the year, neglecting the repair of old waterwheels. As a result, the new waterwheels could not be sold, and the funds were accumulated without being able to circulate.

Purely Profit-Driven Viewpoint Disregards the Demands of the Masses
The root cause of this shortcoming is the society's purely profit-driven viewpoint. They believe that selling new waterwheels is more profitable than lending. A comrade from the society said: "The society has dozens of people, all relying on the profits from selling waterwheels to support us. If we lend out the money, we borrow from the bank at 3% interest, and can only charge 5% interest on external loans. This only earns 2% interest, so is there any profit?" As a result, they did not earnestly implement the basic task of promoting water conservancy throughout the district. The Third Special District Office once discussed with the society lending 600 million to help the masses repair old waterwheels, but the leaders of the society believed that the government had a compassionate viewpoint and delayed lending. Later, when prices soared, they only lent 200 million. However, due to the impact of prices, half of the waterwheels were not repaired. Because they only cared about profits, they did not carefully consider the purchasing power of the masses or determine appropriate prices for the waterwheels. When lending for waterwheels, the society only loaned one-third, with the other two-thirds in cash, calculated in units of rice. However, the waterwheels purchased by the society from Shijiazhuang were more expensive, and the masses were worried that rice prices would rise and did not dare to borrow to buy them. The local government also proposed giving wheat after the loan was granted, but the masses were afraid that wheat would be cheap and rice expensive after the wheat harvest, and they did not dare to borrow to buy them even more. As a result, only a few waterwheels were loaned out in a few months. This situation was not reported to the higher authorities in a timely manner, and the method was only changed after criticism from the leadership recently. The actual degree of implementation is still unknown.

In addition, the bureaucratic work style of the society's leadership is also extremely serious. They are neither proficient in their business nor do they humbly listen to the opinions of the local government and the comrades of the society. At the beginning of ordering waterwheels, the local government suggested ordering and selling locally. Handan has sufficient raw materials. Manufacturing locally can reduce costs and support the development of the iron industry. However, this was not adopted by the society, and instead, a hundred waterwheels were ordered from Shijiazhuang, hundreds of miles away, resulting in high transportation costs and increased costs. The style of the waterwheels is different from the local waterwheels, and there is nowhere to repair the broken parts, and the quality is very poor. The masses do not welcome them. As a result, none of the twenty waterwheels transported to Yongnian have been sold to this day. Yongnian, where the society was originally stationed in the Jinnan water conservancy key area, was in the spring repair season in March, and it was extremely necessary to vigorously lend and sell at this time. The responsible comrade of the society used the excuse that "cadres stationed in Yongnian only eat in the society" and advocated moving out of Yongnian. Most of the comrades in the society disagreed and proposed: "Generally, families will inevitably miss the season, and it is more convenient to engage in water conservancy here than there"; however, the correct opinion was not accepted, and instead, it was said: "The leadership has approved." As a result, in March, they ignored their work and were busy moving, causing great losses to water conservancy work.

### 群众要修旧水车偏叫买新的  官僚主义误了农时  冀南水利推进社要赶快检查纠正

    群众要修旧水车偏叫买新的
    官僚主义误了农时
    冀南水利推进社要赶快检查纠正
    【本报讯】冀南水利推进社由于严重的官僚主义作风，加以单纯的营利观点，不调查研究不根据群众需要，盲目经营，致使水利建设工作遭受到不应有的损失。该社于一月成立，由银行贷来二十五亿元（冀钞，下同）作资金，确定方针以推销新水车为主，贷款扶助修理旧水车为次要工作。但数月来所订购之新水车在三专区仅贷出六辆。在四专区亦贷出无几，款也只贷出二亿元。虽拥有大量资金，却使春修季节白白错过，对近河十四个县份之水利未起到应有的推进作用。
    冀南区近河十四县水车达一万六千辆，因连年欠修及土改中对水车保护注意不够，故损坏很重，全部水车能用者不足万辆，目前群众购买力较低，贷买一辆新水车需米一千余斤，而修理旧水车当时只需二十万元。群众的要求是愿把大批旧水车修理恢复起来，购买力提高后再添置新水车。根据这一现实情况，推进社的经营方针应是以修理旧水车为主，结合贷卖新水车。而该社却计划于上半年推销新水车二千辆，不注意旧水车的修理。结果新水车卖不出去，积压起资金不能周转。
    单纯营利观点不顾群众要求
    产生这一缺点的根源是该社存在着单纯的营利观点。他们认为贷款不如卖新水车有利。该社的一个同志说：“社里好几十个人，全靠卖出水车后营利供给我们。如果把款贷出去，我们从银行三厘利息贷来，外贷只能收五厘利息，这样只赚二厘利息，那还有利吗？”这样他们便不去认真执行推进全区水利这一基本任务。三专署曾与该社商讨贷款六亿，扶助群众修理旧水车，该社领导上却认为政府有慈悲观点迟不贷给。后物价猛涨，才贷给二亿。然已因物价影响，水车少修一半。因只顾营利，便不去精心考虑群众的购买力，确定水车的适当价格。贷水车时该社只贷款三分之一，另三分之二的现款，按米为单位折算，而该社从石门买来之水车价较高，群众顾虑米价上涨不敢贷买，当地政府又提出贷后过麦给麦子，群众又怕收麦后麦贱米贵更不敢贷买。结果几月内只贷出几辆水车。这一情况又未及时请示上级，直至最近经过领导上的批判才改变办法。至今实际执行程度尚不得悉。
    此外该社领导上的官僚主义作风也极严重。既不精通业务，又不虚心听取当地政府及该社同志的意见。开始订购水车时，当地政府曾建议就地订购，就地推销。邯市原料充足，在当地制造，成本既可降低且能扶植铁工业发展，但未被该社采纳，却去石门订购水车百辆，往返数百里，运费高昂，成本提高。该水车与当地水车式样不一，零件坏了没处修理，且质量很坏，群众都不欢迎，结果运至永年的二十辆水车，至今没卖出一辆。该社原驻冀南水利重点区之永年，三月份正是处于春修季节，极应大力贷卖之际，该社负责同志竟以“驻在永年来往干部光在社里吃饭”为借口，主张迁出永年，社里大部同志不同意，提出：“一般家势必错过季节，那里不如这里搞水利便利”；但正确意见未被接受，反说：“领导上已批准”。结果三月份扔下工作不管光忙于搬家，使水利工作受到极大损失。
