[Chahar News] Liu Haishan, a skilled electric welding technician, felt that the current of the original AC welding machine was too large and could not be adjusted. Whenever he had to weld thin iron pieces, he would create holes. Furthermore, after using it for twenty minutes, it would overheat. So, he devoted himself to researching a water-cooled electric welding tank (electric welding resistor). After planning the dimensions, he drew a diagram. Carpenter Zhang Fengshan actively helped, and after work, he rushed to make the wooden box. The wooden box was completed in eight hours. Old Liu happily rushed to test it. He put 350 jin of gunpowder in the wooden box, added about 5 jin of salt, and dissolved it as an electrolytic solution. He used two iron plates as electrodes, and two wires were suspended in the electrolytic solution. By moving them up or down, or closer or further, he could adjust the distance of the electrode plates and the area of contact with the electrolytic solution at will. The size of the current could be adjusted by the size of the resistance, and regardless of the thickness of the iron to be welded, the current could be freely increased or decreased for welding. However, the first test failed to ignite due to poor connection. After modification, the second test still failed to ignite. The third time, the electric arc was too strong and blew the fuse, making him sweat profusely, but he was not discouraged. The fourth time, the electric arc was too small, until the fifth time it was successfully tested. It works even better than the Japanese-made welding machine.

　　宣化纸厂技工刘海山
  　创造水电焊水箱
    【察哈尔讯】熟练的电焊技工刘海山，感到原有的交流电焊机电流过大，不能调节，每逢要焊轻薄的铁活，一焊就成孔眼，并且使用起来经过二十分钟，就要发热。于是他便用心研究水电焊水箱（电焊抵抗器），计划好尺寸后，划了图，木工张凤山积极帮忙，每到下班后，就赶做木箱子，八个小时木箱做成，老刘高兴的赶快试验，木箱里放进火药三百五十斤，加入食盐约五斤，溶解后，作为电液，又用两块铁板，做为电极，再用两根电线，悬在电液里，或上或下，或远或近，可以把极板的距离及接触电液的面积，随意调节，由电阻的大小可调节电流的大小，不管电焊铁活厚薄，都可自由加减电流来烧焊。但第一次试验因连接不好，打不着火；经修改后第二次还打不着火；第三次电弧猛烈，烧坏了保险，急的他直出汗，但他并不灰心；第四次电弧又小了，直到第五次才试验成功。使用起来比日本造的电焊机还好。（宣化造纸厂通讯组）
