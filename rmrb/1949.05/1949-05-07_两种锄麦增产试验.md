Two Wheat Weeding Yield Increase Experiments

It is generally known that weeding wheat can increase yield, make wheat grains have shallow ventral grooves, thin bran, and produce more flour, and prevent land from becoming barren. In the past two years, agricultural experiment stations have conducted such experiments, and the results have been very significant.

A. Results of the 1947 experiment at the Junan Dadian Agricultural Guidance Station Farm:

	1. No weeding: Yield per mu was 159.96 jin
	2. Weeding twice: Yield per mu was 183.28 jin

According to this result, weeding the wheat field twice can increase the yield by 23.32 jin per mu, which is an increase of 14.58% of the total yield.

This is a simple, large-area, non-repeated experimental result. Last year's experiment was a small-area experiment and was more detailed.

B. Results of the 1948 experiment at the Juxian Farm directly under the Agricultural Experiment Institute:

Weeding once increased production by 7.87 jin compared to no weeding, and weeding twice increased production by 14.18 jin. In addition, the weight per dou of the weeded wheat was two jin heavier (per 14-jin dou), and each dou produced three jin more flour.

The experiment at the Juxian Farm was conducted under conditions of sandy loam soil, sufficient rainfall, and few weeds. It is estimated that if there is a lack of rain, barren land, or sticky soil, the results will be even greater.

    两种锄麦增产试验
    一般人都知道锄麦可以增加产量，并且麦粒的腹沟浅，麸皮薄，出面多，而且不至荒芜了地。前年和去年农业实验场里都作过这种试验，效果均很显著。
    甲、一九四七年莒南大店农业指导所农场试验结果：
    一、不锄的：每亩产量１５９．９６斤
    二、锄两次的：每亩产量１８３．２８斤
    照这个结果看来，多锄两遍麦地每亩可以多打２３．３２斤，也就是增加全产量的１４．５８％。
    这是简单的较大面积的没有重复的试验结果，去年则是小区试验，并比较细密。
    乙、一九四八年农业试验所直属莒县农场的试验结果：
    锄一次比不锄多产７．８７斤，锄两次多产１４．１８斤，并且锄的每斗重量多二斤（十四斤的斗），每斗多出面三斤。
    莒县农场的试验，是在砂质壤土、雨量不缺、杂草不多的条件下进行的估计，如果缺乏雨水、土地荒芜、土质粘紧的话，成绩当会更大。
