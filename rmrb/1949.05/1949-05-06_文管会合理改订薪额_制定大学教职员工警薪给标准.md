    Cultural Management Committee Reasonably Revises Salaries
    Formulates Salary Standards for University Faculty, Staff and Police
    [Reported by this newspaper] The salaries of faculty, staff, and police in Beiping universities were temporarily paid according to the original salaries after liberation, based on the average actual income of the three months of September, October, and November of last year. The salary standards set during the Kuomintang rule were unreasonable and urgently needed to be re-established. Simultaneously with the establishment of new school affairs committees in various universities and the promulgation of the Student People's Scholarship Regulations, the Cultural Management Committee also re-revised the salary standards for faculty, staff, and police in various universities. All are calculated in terms of millet, unaffected by price fluctuations. The monthly salary for university presidents is set at 1,300 to 1,500 catties of millet, the monthly salary for presidents of specialized schools or independent colleges is 1,000 to 1,300 catties of millet, and the monthly salary for professors and associate professors is 800 to 1,300 catties of millet. Professors (doctors) in medical schools receive an additional 20% based on their original salary level. The monthly salary for lecturers, teachers, and teaching assistants is 400 to 850 catties of millet, the monthly salary for staff is 250 to 750 catties of millet, the monthly salary for workers and police is 180 to 450 catties of millet (those with special skills may be appropriately increased, but not exceeding 550 catties), and the monthly salary for apprentices is 120 to 180 catties of millet. The principles for evaluating the above salaries are: professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants are based on four criteria: academic contribution, technical ability, years of service, and service performance; staff and police are based on three criteria: technical ability, service performance, and years of service; apprentices are based on two criteria: years of study and service performance. There are also specific regulations for other part-time courses, teaching hours for teachers, and daily working hours for staff and police. This standard was drafted by the Cultural Management Committee, widely discussed by various schools, and the results were reported to the Cultural Management Committee, which promulgated it for trial implementation. Each school will then formulate specific salary amounts for each faculty, staff, and police member based on this. In addition, the Tsinghua University Professors' Association has drafted a temporary method of calculating branch salaries for current professors and associate professors, which has also been forwarded by the Cultural Management Committee to various schools as a reference for evaluating salaries.

    文管会合理改订薪额
    制定大学教职员工警薪给标准
    【本报讯】北平各大学教职员工警的薪给，在解放以后，仍暂按原薪，以去年九、十、十一三个月的实际所得平均数发给，国民党统治时期所订的薪给标准原不合理，急待重新订定。于各大学新的校务委员会成立及学生人民助学金条例颁布的同时，文管会又将各大学教职员工警薪给标准重新改订。均以小米计算，不受物价波动影响。计大学校长月薪为小米一千三百斤至一千五百斤，专科学校校长或独立学院院长月薪为小米一千斤至一千三百斤，教授、副教授月薪为小米八百斤至一千三百斤，医学院教授（医生）依照原级薪加百分之二十。讲师教员助教月薪为小米四百斤至八百五十斤，职员月薪为小米二百五十斤至七百五十斤，工警月薪为小米一百八十斤至四百五十斤（有特殊技术者得酌量提高，但不得高于五百五十斤），学徒月薪为小米一百二十斤至一百八十斤。以上薪给的评定原则，教授、副教授及讲教助等依据学术贡献，技术能力，服务年资，服务成绩四项；职员工警依据技术能力，服务成绩，服务年资三项；学徒依据学习年资服务成绩二项具体评定。其他兼课，教员教课时数，职员工警每日工作时间等，均有规定。此项标准，系由文管会制订草案，经过各校普遍讨论，将结果呈报文管会，由文管会颁布试行。各校即将据此详细订定各教职员工警的具体薪额。又清华大学教授联谊会拟订一种现任教授副教授计分支薪临时办法，也经文管会转发各校，作为评定薪给的参考。
