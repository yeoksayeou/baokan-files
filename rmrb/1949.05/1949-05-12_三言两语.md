    A Miniature
    The agricultural symposium held in Beiping can be said to be a miniature of the unity between urban and rural areas. With large cities, our agriculture and science can be combined. Under unified planning and scientific guidance, we can gradually help farmers get rid of their current production methods, strengthen mass agricultural education, and promote large-scale production together in urban and rural areas.
    Important Instruction
    The Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters' instruction to the Discipline Enforcement Corps should be observed by all Party, government, military, and civilian organizations and people in Beiping and Tianjin to ensure its implementation. We are not banning all vendors, but only the illegal ones. Legitimate vendors who register with the municipal government and abide by government laws and regulations will be protected. The instruction provides specific and feasible methods for preventing traffic accidents, and all localities should begin implementing them immediately without further delay.
    Beggars' New Life
    Beggars turning to production can only be realized in people's cities led by the Communist Party. Beggars are a legacy of the old society's sins. The ruling class created poverty, forcing many people to beg for food and clothing. In people's cities, this shameful phenomenon must be gradually eliminated by educating beggars and leading them to engage in production and become working people.

    三言两语
    一个缩影
    在平召开的农业座谈会，可以说是一个城乡关系团结的缩影，有了大城市，我们的农业和科学便可以结合起来，在统一计划和科学指导下，一步一步帮助农民摆脱现在的生产方式，加强群众农业教育，城乡一致共同开展大生产。
    重要的训令
    平津卫戍司令部对纠察总队的训令，平津两市党政军民机关团体及人民均应一体遵守，保证其贯彻实现。我们不是取缔一切摊贩，而是取缔其中非法的部份，正当的摊贩只要向市府登记，遵守政府法令，一律将被保护。该训令对于防止车祸办法规定得具体明确，简易可行，各地应即着手进行，不可再有延缓。
    乞丐新生
    乞丐转上生产，只有在共产党领导的人民城市才会实现。乞丐本是旧社会遗留下的罪恶痕迹，统治阶级制造了贫困，大批人只好无衣无食，求乞度日，在人民城市里，一定要逐步消灭这一可耻现象，教育乞丐，带动他们走生产、作一个劳动人民。
