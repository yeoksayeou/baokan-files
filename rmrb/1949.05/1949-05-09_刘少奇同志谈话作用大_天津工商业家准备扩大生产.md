    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's Talk Has a Great Effect
    Tianjin Industrialists and Businessmen Prepare to Expand Production

    [This newspaper, Tianjin] Following Comrade Liu Shaoqi's recent widespread exchange of views with all sectors of industry and commerce in Tianjin, industrialists and businessmen generally have a further understanding of the people's government's New Democratic economic policy and are excitedly preparing to exert their strength to increase production.

    Li Zhuchen, General Manager of Jiuda Refined Salt Company, said: "Mr. Liu Shaoqi's talk with all sectors of industry and commerce this time has had a great effect on the future of the entire Tianjin industry. It has enabled large and small industrialists to have a clearer understanding of the government's policies. In the future, the work of increasing production can be completed very quickly. Since liberation, labor-capital problems have occurred in general factories because of insufficient understanding of labor-capital relations. These problems can be resolved rationally in the future."

    Zi Yaohua, Manager of Shanghai Bank, said: "After liberation, some people held negative and uncooperative attitudes because they did not understand the policies of the people's government and were influenced by the Kuomintang's deliberate sabotage propaganda. This attitude had a very bad effect and slowed down the progress of production. After listening to Mr. Liu Shaoqi's talk, everyone understood what to do in the future, and everyone correctly grasped the line of the New Democratic economic policy. We know that we want to advance this agricultural production country to an industrial production country. Therefore, we must develop production. And to develop production, we must take into account both public and private interests, and both labor and capital can benefit. However, don't think it's too easy to do things. We should pay attention to putting public interests first and then private interests in taking into account both public and private interests, and putting labor first and then capital in benefiting both labor and capital. As for private banks, as long as the industry is developed, there is hope."

    Dong Xifan, Deputy Manager of Huaxin Yarn Factory, said: "Our understanding of the people's government's policies was not sufficient before. After Mr. Liu Shaoqi talked with us, we had a deeper understanding of the correctness of the policies. Mr. Liu explained the most about the issue of labor-capital relations, which gave us a deeper understanding of labor-capital relations. To develop production, we must achieve mutual benefit for both labor and capital. After liberation, industrialists generally held skeptical attitudes towards labor-capital issues. After Mr. Liu explained, the doubts have been eliminated, and production is expected to increase. Both labor and capital should benefit each other. What the labor side demands from the capital side is reasonable treatment, and the capital side should also think about reasonableness when handling wages. The laissez-faire and fearful attitude towards labor-capital disputes in the past was also wrong."

    Zhu Jisheng, General Manager of Renli Company, said: "After listening to Mr. Liu Shaoqi's words, capitalists don't need to be afraid anymore. Because capitalists have a clear understanding of the government's policies, capitalists can benefit because surplus value will definitely be generated in the production process. This surplus value should be used for new production as much as possible. The hesitant and skeptical attitude held in the past has also been eliminated. We understand the road taken by the New Democratic economic policy. As long as we develop production reasonably, capitalists are friends of the government and cooperate with the government. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, private enterprises and factories suffered from the exploitation of bureaucratic capital and could not develop normally. Now that they are liberated, they will no longer be oppressed, and developing production will inevitably be effective."

    Si Nansheng, Manager of Qixin Cement Company, said: "In the past, we suffered a lot: we had the strength but no opportunity to show it. Now, thanks to the government's help, we can fully exert our strength and bring out our potential."

    After listening to the report, Xia Xueqin, Deputy Manager of Jincheng Bank, immediately publicized to his colleagues the relationship between the government's protection of industry and commerce and the legitimate development of commercial banks.

    刘少奇同志谈话作用大
    天津工商业家准备扩大生产
    【本报天津讯】由于刘少奇同志最近在天津普遍与工商业各界交换意见后，一般工商业家对人民政府的新民主主义的经济政策有了进一步的了解，都兴奋的积极准备发挥力量增加生产。
    久大精盐公司总经理李烛尘说：刘少奇先生这次和工商业各界谈话，对于整个天津工业前途起很大的作用。使大小工业家对于政府政策有了更明确的认识。今后增加生产的工作，可以很迅速的完成。解放后一般工厂发生劳资问题，都因为对于劳资关系的认识不够。今后这些问题都可得到合理的解央。
    上海银行经理资耀华说：解放后有些人因为不了解人民政府的政策，并且受了国民党蓄意破坏的宣传，所以多持消极和不合作的态度。这种态度起了很坏的作用，使生产进展迟缓。听过刘少奇先生一番谈话之后，大家才了解今后应该怎样的去做，大家才正确地把握了新民主主义经济政策的路线。知道我们是要把这个农业生产的国家，进步到工业生产的国家。所以必需发展生产。而发展生产就必须公私兼顾，劳资两利才能做得好。不过不要因此把事情看得太容易做了，应注意在公私兼顾上必须先公而后私，在劳资两利上必须先劳而后资，至于私人银行只要工业发达，是有希望的。
    华新纱厂副经理董洗凡说：我们对于人民政府的政策，以前了解的程度不够，在刘少奇先生和我们谈话以后，我们更深刻的了解了政策的正确性。刘先生解释最多的是关于劳资关系的问题，使我们对于劳资关系有了更深一层的认识。要发展生产，必须做到劳资两利。解放后一般工业家对于劳资问题多持怀疑态度，经刘先生解释后，疑虑已消，生产可望增加。劳资双方应该是两利的。劳方向资方要求的是合理的待遇，资方处理工资时也应在合理上去着想。过去对于劳资发生纠纷时，所持的放任和害怕的态度也是不对的。
    仁立公司总经理朱继圣说：听了刘少奇先生的话，资本家不用害怕了。因为资本家们对于政府的政策有了明确的了解，资本家是可以有好处的，因为在生产过程中一定会产生剩余价值的。这种剩余价值尽可能使用到新的生产方面去。以前所持的傍徨和怀疑的态度也都消除了。明自了新民主主义的经济政策所采取的道路，只要合理的发展生产，资本家就是政府的朋友，是与政府合作的。在国民党统治下，私人企业和工厂受尽了官僚资本的压榨，得不到正常的发展，现在解放了，再也不会受到压迫，发展生产是必然可获得效果的。
    启新洋灰公司经理姒南笙说：过去我们受到许多苦处：有力量而没有机会去表现。现在由于政府的帮忙，我们可充分发扬自己的力量，并且要把潜在的力量发挥出来。
    金城银行的副经理夏雪芹在听了报告后，即向该行同事宣传政府保护工商业有利于商业银行的正当发展的关系。
