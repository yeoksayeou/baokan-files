　　The Northeast Military Region Military Supply Department's No. 1 Bureau Clothing Factory has significantly improved production quality and quantity by implementing scientific division of labor and establishing a dedicated responsibility system. Previously, each worker in the factory independently completed the entire sewing process, with one person using one machine to make a complete set of clothes. This not only resulted in low production efficiency and difficulty in exchanging experience, but also made it difficult to overcome the narrow experience and conservative viewpoints formed by workers in the old society. After the merger of the Military Supply Department No. 1 Bureau Clothing Factory and the No. 3 and 4 Bureau Clothing Factories last December, the above-mentioned production organization method was broken, and 120 to 140 sewing machines were concentrated to form several large workshops. Each workshop was further divided into several parts according to the production process. For example, the sewing of soldiers' uniforms was divided into eight groups: making collars, pocket flaps, pocket linings, front plackets, sleeves, etc., each group specializing in one part, and then combining them to complete a set of clothes. This clear division of labor made it easier for workers to master skills, and output quickly reached or exceeded the highest standards set by the Military Supply Department. For example, workers using electric machines used to make eight and a half sets of soldiers' uniforms per person per day (ten hours). Two months after implementing the new production organization, the average increased to eleven and a half sets, exceeding the prescribed highest standard by one and a half sets. Workers using ordinary machines also increased from six and a half sets per person per day to eight sets, reaching the prescribed highest standard. Due to the interdependence of the work of each group after the division of labor, workers were mutually responsible, and inspections were carried out at all levels, so the quality was also improved compared to before. The skills of apprentices have also improved faster than before due to the strict division of labor. Scientific division of labor saves raw materials. This year, in completing the first and second phases of production tasks, the entire factory saved a total of 350,000 square feet of cloth and more than 100,000 meters of thread compared to before. Another important gain from centralized production and scientific division of labor is the strengthening of workers' collective consciousness and unity, and the rapid change of the conservative thinking and style of small producers existing among factory management and workers. The Military Supply Department is now calling on all factories to learn from the experience of this factory and promote this scientific production system.

　　东北军需一局被服厂
  　生产分工科学化原料节省效率高
    【新华社沈阳电】人民解放军东北军区军需部第一局被服厂在实行科学分工和建立专责制度，生产质量与数量显著提高。该厂每个工人原来都是单独完成全部缝制过程的，即一人用一部机器制好全套衣服。这样不但生产效率低，经验不易交流，而且工人在旧社会形成的狭隘经验和保守观点亦不易克服。去年十二月军需部一局被服厂与三四局被服厂合并后，便打破上述生产组织方式，集中一百二十台至一百四十台缝纫机组成若干大作业室。各室又按生产过程再分成若干部分。如缝制战士服，即分成做领子、兜盖、扎兜布、上贴边、做袖子等八个组，各组专做一件，然后合起来完成一套衣服。这样分工明确，工人技术易于熟练，产量迅速达到或超过军需部规定的最高标准。如使用电机的工人，过去每人每天（十小时）做战士服八套半，实行新的生产组织后两个月，平均提高到十一套半，超过规定的最高标准一套半。使用普通机器的工人亦由每人每天六套半提高到八套，达到了规定的最高标准。分工后由于各组工作互相关联，工人们互相负责，层层督促检查，因而质量也较前提高。学徒的技术也因分工严密而较前进步迅速。分工科学使原料节省，全厂今年在完成第一、二期生产任务中，较前共节省布三十五万平方尺，线十余万公尺。集中生产科学分工的另一重要收获是加强了工人的集体观念和团结，迅速改变了工厂管理人员和工人中存在着的小生产者的保守思想和作风。军需部现正号召各厂学习该厂的经验，推广这一科学的生产制度。
