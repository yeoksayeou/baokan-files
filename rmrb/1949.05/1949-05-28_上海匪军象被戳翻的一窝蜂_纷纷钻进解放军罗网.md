Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. Frontline reporters report: The People's Liberation Army, having crushed the enemy's resistance, poured into Greater Shanghai via multiple routes. At 1:00 AM on the 25th, they victoriously converged at the Shanghai Racecourse in the city center. On the 24th, the troops that captured Hongqiao Airport, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, continued to advance courageously along Hongqiao Road, taking down the dense network of steel-reinforced concrete fortifications one by one. At 9:00 PM, the PLA crossed the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway in the Shanghai area and, illuminated by the bright electric lights along the road, surged into the city. The PLA's brave attacks completely took the enemy by surprise. The special car of the bandit's Songhu Garrison Headquarters, carrying confidential documents, actually drove straight into the PLA's position. Bandit leader Chen Daqing had no idea that when his martial law order, prohibiting all public and private vehicles from passing starting on the 24th, was delivered, the bandit traffic police 15th Detachment and the bandit Ministry of National Defense Armored Car 4th Battalion, along with their twenty-some armored vehicles and tanks, had already been captured by the PLA. When the PLA fought to the doorsteps of these bandits, they were awakened from their dreams. Like an upset hornets' nest, they scrambled in all directions, fleeing into the PLA's net. One regiment of the PLA alone captured over two thousand bandit soldiers in a few hours. At dawn on the 25th, the PLA's follow-up troops marched into the city in several columns. The entering troops were strictly disciplined, with those not on combat duty resting on the sidewalks by the roadside, none entering shops or civilian residences. Because the currency value was yet to be determined, not a single soldier bought anything from shops or civilians. The troops all carried their own dry rations. By 10:00 AM, the area south of the Suzhou Creek was completely liberated, and order in the city was quickly restored, with vehicles coming and going incessantly.

　　上海匪军象被戳翻的一窝蜂
  　纷纷钻进解放军罗网
    【新华社上海二十七日电】前线记者报道：粉碎了敌人抵抗的人民解放军，分路源源涌进大上海，二十五日晨一时，就在市中心跑马厅胜利会师。二十四日，攻占虹桥飞机场的部队，在猛烈的炮火掩护下，沿着虹桥路继续奋勇前进，逐一打下密网般的钢骨水泥集团工事，下午九时，解放军就冲过了上海区沪杭甬铁路，在沿路通明的电灯的照耀下，向市内涌进。各路解放军勇猛的进击，完全出乎敌人意料之外。匪淞沪区警备司令部抢送机密文件的专车竟一直驶到解放军的阵地里来。匪首陈大庆一点也没有想到，当他发布的在二十四日起禁止一切公私车辆通行的戒严令送到时，守备林森路的匪交警十五总队和匪国防部装甲车第四营已经和他们的二十几辆装甲车、坦克，被解放军俘获了。当解放军打到这些匪徒们的大门口，这些匪徒们才从睡梦中惊醒。他们就象被戳翻了的一窝蜂，向四面乱钻，纷纷钻进了解放军的罗网。仅解放军的一个团，在几个钟头内，就俘虏了匪军二千余名。二十五日拂晓，解放军的后续部队就排成数路纵队开入了市区。入城部队纪律严明，没有战斗任务的都在马路边的人行道上休息，没有一个进入商店或市民住宅。因币值尚待规定，部队没有一个人向商店或市民购买东西。部队都自带干粮。当午十时苏州河以南地区全部解放，市内秩序迅速恢复，车辆来往不绝。
