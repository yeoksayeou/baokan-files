    Zhengding Third District
    Canal Construction to Suppress Alkali and Sow Seeds in Moist Soil
    [Chahar News] In the Pingqiu and Zhoujiazhuang areas of Zhengding Third District, covering more than twenty villages, the terrain is low-lying and damp. Every spring, salt and alkali emerge, and mole crickets proliferate, causing significant damage to crops. Sowing seeds four or five times often fails to produce seedlings. Several waterings or thorough rainfall are needed to reduce the alkalinity before sowing can be successful. As a result, planting crops is often delayed, and the masses urgently need water to suppress alkali and improve the soil for production. In the spring of 1947, the government led the masses of Litun and two other villages to jointly open a large canal, irrigating 1,500 mu of land. Last year, due to drought, Hucun opened a branch canal to irrigate 1,000 mu of land. Last year's flood largely destroyed the main canal, and the masses were unable to restore it. In the second lunar month, the government provided a loan of 80,000 yuan (People's Currency) to help purchase equipment, and allocated 8,000 jin of famine relief grain, combining disaster relief with work relief, solving the problem of some disaster victims unable to maintain their livelihoods due to working, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the canal project. Over the course of a month, 11,000 workdays were invested, completing a main canal project that was two zhang wide, two chi deep, and twenty-three li long. In addition, 72 small branch canals and 47 water diversion and irrigation gates were constructed. By March 15th, water was released for irrigation. In addition to restoring the original 2,500 mu of irrigated land, four more villages benefited, expanding the irrigated area by 4,600 mu. They are now irrigating the wheat for the second time and sowing cotton, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and major autumn crops in moist soil, which will be completed soon. The alkalinity of the irrigated land has been greatly reduced, no longer affecting sowing, and pest damage has also been reduced. The masses in the beneficiary villages happily said, "This time, our worries about seedlings not taking root have been cured." The expanded irrigation is expected to increase production by two shi per mu, potentially increasing production by 920 shi. (Cheng Guoquan, Lu Mengshuang)

    正定三区
    开渠压碱阴地播种
    【察哈尔讯】正定三区平邱、周家庄一带二十余村，地势低洼阴湿，每年春季盐碱齐出，蝼蛄普生，对农作物危害很大。春耕播种四、五次不能捉苗。需浇几次水或落透雨，碱性减少才能播种。因此种植庄稼很难及时，群众对用水压碱改良地质以利生产要求迫切。四七年春人民政府曾领导里屯等三村群众合开大渠一道，浇地一千五百亩，去年天旱，胡村又开一支渠浇地一千亩。去年洪水将干渠大部冲毁，群众无力恢复。阴历二月政府贷给八万元（人民券）帮助购买器材，并拨渡荒救济粮八千斤，结合救灾，以工代赈解决了部分灾民因做工无法维持生活的困难，使渠工顺利进行。在一个月当中用工一万一千个，完成了宽二丈、深二尺、长二十三华里的干渠工程。另外还修小支渠七十二条，分水浇地两用闸四十七处，至三月十五号放水浇地，除恢复旧有浇地二千五百亩外，增加了四个受益村，扩大了浇地面积四千六百亩。现正浇二水麦子，阴地播种棉花、花生、红薯、及大秋作物，最近可浇完。浇过的地碱性大减，已不影响播种，且减少了虫害。受益村群众高兴的说：“这一回可把咱们按不住苗的愁病治了。”扩大的浇地，预计每亩增产二市斗，可增产九百二十市石。（程国权、芦梦双）
