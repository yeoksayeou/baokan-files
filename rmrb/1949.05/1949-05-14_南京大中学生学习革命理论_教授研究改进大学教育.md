Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: A movement to study revolutionary theory has been widely launched among university and middle school students in Nanjing. Since the Study Week began on May 4th, the Nanjing Student Union has distributed 5,000 copies of "On New Democracy" and 20,000 copies of the pamphlet "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" to university and middle school students as the main study materials.

    Central University took the lead in establishing study groups, joint wall newspapers, and radio stations, setting off a wave of learning. The school is currently enthusiastically discussing the CCP's urban policies and how to assist the People's Government in taking over and building a people's city. Discussion meetings held every night often last until late into the night.

    Nanjing University has established more than 60 study groups, proposing to fill the Nanjing campus with a strong progressive atmosphere and get rid of the academic learning style. The National Political University has established 59 study groups, focusing on studying documents on the transformation of petty-bourgeois intellectuals in order to examine and transform themselves.

    The Conservatory of Music and the Drama Academy, based on the guidelines indicated by Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, are studying "The White Haired Girl" and popular literature and art issues. Jian Guo College of Law and Commerce has begun to criticize counter-revolutionary laws from a new perspective. In addition to their own studies, the Frontier College has also run schools for workers, youth, and women to promote revolutionary knowledge.

    Professors from Central University, Nanjing University, National Political University, and other schools have also begun to study revolutionary theory. The study movement first unfolded in universities, spreading from groups to departments and then expanding to the entire school.

    Under the call of the Middle School Student Union and influenced by the university study movement, middle schools in Nanjing have also launched the study of New Democracy. Central University Affiliated Middle School and Lequn, Xuanwu, and other middle schools have organized to study with the help of Central University students. Some middle schools have also invited the People's Liberation Army and staff from the Cultural and Educational Takeover Committee of the Military Control Commission to give lectures at the schools. Teachers from Municipal No. 1 Middle School and other schools also study with students and review the non-democratic style of ignoring student opinions in the past.

    With the development of the study movement, the issue of educational reform has also been raised. Twenty-nine professors from Central University, Nanjing University, Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, and other schools have organized a "University Education Improvement Committee" to discuss the abolition of the Kuomintang's "Guidance Department" and get rid of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal fascist educational ideology and educational system, and establish a new democratic educational theory and educational system. More than sixty middle school teachers from the Secondary School Teachers' Union also gathered to discuss middle school education improvement issues.

    During the study, many educated youths realized the importance of participating in revolutionary practice. More than a hundred university and middle school students in the city have joined the People's Liberation Army. Among them, the number of drama students joining the People's Liberation Army accounts for one-third of the total number of students in the school.

    【新华社南京十二日电】南京市各大、中学校学生普遍地开展了学习革命理论的运动。自五月四日学习周开始后，南京区学生联合会即将五千本“新民主主义论”与两万本“将革命进行到底”的小册子分发给各大、中学校学生，作为学习的主要文件。中央大学首先建立了学习小组、联合壁报和广播台，掀起学习的热潮。现该校正热烈研讨中共的城市政策及如何协助人民政府进行接管工作与建设人民城市等问题，每晚举行的讨论会，常开至深夜始散。金陵大学成立了六十多个学习小组，提出要使金陵园内充满浓厚的进步空气，摆脱学院派的学习方式的口号。政治大学成立了五十九个学习小组，着重学习关于改造小资产阶级的知识分子的文件，借以检讨改造自己。音乐学院与戏剧专科学校依据毛泽东在延安文艺座谈会上讲话所指示的方针，研究“白毛女”及大众文艺问题。建国法商学院开始用新的观点批判反革命的法律。边疆学院除自己学习外，并开办了工人、青年、妇女等学校，推广革命知识。中央大学、金陵大学、政治大学等校教授亦开始研究革命理论。学习运动首先于各大学展开，各校由小组普及到系科，再扩大为全校。在中学学联号召下和在大学学习运动的影响下，南京市各中学亦已纷纷开展对新民主主义的学习。中央大学附中及乐群、玄武等中学在中央大学学生帮助下已组织起来进行学习。有的中学校并邀请解放军及军管会文教接管委员会的工作人员到校讲演。市立一中等校教师亦与学生一道学习，并检讨过去漠视学生意见的非民主作风。随着学习运动的开展，教育改革问题，也被提出来了。中央大学、金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院等校廿九名教授已组织“大学教育改进委员会”，讨论取消国民党的“训导处”及摆脱半殖民地半封建的法西斯的教育思想与教育制度，建立新民主主义的教育理论与教育制度问题；中等学校教师联合会六十余中学教师亦集会讨论中学教育改进问题。在学习中，不少知识青年认识了参加革命实践的重要。全市大、中学生已有百余人参加了解放军。其中剧专参加解放军的人数占全校学生三分之一。
