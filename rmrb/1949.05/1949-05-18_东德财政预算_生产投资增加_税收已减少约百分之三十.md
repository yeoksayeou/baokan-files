Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, Berlin: The German Economic Commission held a plenary session in Berlin on the 14th and passed the fiscal year budget for 1949 for the Soviet occupation zone government and state governments. The budget stipulates revenue of 11,985 million German marks and expenditure of 10,810 million marks. Revenue exceeds expenditure by 1,175 million marks. Due to the implementation of tax system reforms, tax revenue has been reduced by approximately 30%. Tax revenue now accounts for 46% of the total budget revenue, compared to 60% last year. Budget expenditures stipulate increased investment in the national economy, funding for machine rental stations, and a substantial increase in social and cultural expenditures. All of this demonstrates the increasing consolidation of the Soviet occupation zone's economy.

  　税收已减少约百分之三十
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社柏林讯：德国经济委员会于十四日在柏林举行全会，通过了苏占区政府及州政府一九四九年财政年度的预算。预算规定岁入一百一十九亿八千五百万德国马克，岁出一百零八亿一千万马克。收入超出支出十一亿七千五百万马克。由于实行了税制改革，税收已减少约百分之三十。现在税收占预算总收入百分之四十六，去年则是百分之六十。预算支出项规定增加对国民经济的投资，资助机器租借站的费用，以及大量增加社会文化费用。所有这一切证明苏占区经济益加巩固。
