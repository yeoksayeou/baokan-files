    Chapter Two: The Communist Party (Continued 3)
    Once the discussion meetings started, only DaShui and XiaoMei remained silent in the group. Others would ask, “Why aren’t you speaking up?” DaShui would say, “We’re just farmers, I can only speak farmer talk. You want me to give a speech? I wouldn’t even know how!” When XiaoMei was pressed, she almost cried from embarrassment. Everyone encouraged them, “Just say what you remember, you'll learn slowly!” DaShui spent several nights tossing and turning, unable to sleep, worrying himself half-sick. He said to XiaoMei, “We’re like hoes in a sorghum field, growing from the same seed, two dumb clucks. After we’re trained and go back, we won’t understand anything, what will we do?” XiaoMei also said with a worried frown, “Who says we won’t! We're two clumsy ducks who can't get on the perch. After this training, we'll just have bellies full of millet rice, how will we face anyone back home?” DaShui said, “I don’t believe it! Other people are people, and we’re people too, can't we learn?” Every day, during breaks, Cheng Ping taught them to read. At night, DaShui would lie down and draw characters on his belly. During class, he forced himself to listen, and slowly he began to understand. At the group meeting, DaShui resolved to speak, breaking out in a sweat, his words jumbled and stammering. XiaoMei, blushing, also followed along with a few sentences. Everyone said, “Great, great, these two are getting the hang of it!”
    DaShui was more diligent than anyone else. Every day, he woke up the earliest, swept the yard and the room, and prepared the washing and gargling water for the comrades. After everyone got up, he folded each quilt into neat squares. At the life review meeting, he became a model; many people praised him. DaShui was very embarrassed and said, “We farmers don’t have any other skills, we just know how to work hard.” Later, Comrade Cheng Ping even mentioned Niu DaShui’s name at the general meeting and praised him. DaShui was overjoyed.
    DaShui felt that he had made progress, and he was afraid that XiaoMei would fall behind. One time after singing lessons, after everyone had dispersed, he asked XiaoMei, “How are you doing? Are you getting used to the life here?” XiaoMei’s cut hair reached her neck, her face tanned black and red. She was much more relaxed and lively, her two big eyes looking at DaShui spiritedly, saying, “Why wouldn’t I be?” She repeated what Sister Chen had told them, saying, "You have to endure hardship. We're 'training'! We have to be able to endure any hardship when fighting the Japanese later!" DaShui was shocked and thought, "Wow, XiaoMei has made a lot of progress!" XiaoMei hopped away, her hair blowing in the wind, still singing "The Youth March":
    Forward,
    Chinese youth!
    Stand up to fight,
    Chinese youth…
    【Note】③ Huozi: A type of sorghum.

    One day, right in the middle of class, DaShui ran out of tobacco in his tobacco pouch. He endured it for a long time, but it was too uncomfortable, so he secretly slipped out and bought two cigarettes from a candy stall at the entrance. The discipline of the training class was very strict, and buying cigarettes was forbidden. Afraid of being found out, he hid in the toilet, pretending to defecate, enjoying his cigarette. Just then, a classmate came to relieve himself. DaShui quickly stubbed out the cigarette, and crushed the other one under his foot. The classmate saw it clearly out of the corner of his eye, and reported him.
    That evening, they held a group meeting and criticized DaShui severely. One said, “Why didn’t you listen carefully in class?” Another said, “Do you have any discipline?” DaShui’s face turned bright red, and he stammered, “I… I’m doing this for the first time! I don’t have any tobacco left. Please, everyone, forgive me.” Before he could finish speaking, people started shouting. One person said, “Reporting to the chair, I have an opinion about him!” Another person said, “Reporting to the chair, I also have an opinion…” It was as if one gourd was pressed down, and another floated up; everyone said that Niu DaShui didn’t accept criticism and wasn’t sincere. Even XiaoMei joined in the shouting, “I also report to the chair…”
    DaShui got angry and thought, "What crime is smoking a cigarette?" In a fit of pique, he pulled out his small tobacco pipe and said, "Damn it, for such a thing; I'll never smoke this damned tobacco again in my life!" With that, he snapped the pipe in half over his knee, and angrily said, "See if I can change or not! Does a Chinese person not have this much ability!" After speaking he threw the two pieces of the pipe on the ground and left.
    DaShui was so angry that he couldn’t sleep half the night, and almost cried. The next day, he was still sulking, ignoring everyone, and even when XiaoMei spoke to him, he didn’t respond. In the afternoon, Cheng Ping called him in. Cheng Ping asked him to speak first, and DaShui angrily recounted everything. Cheng Ping smiled and patiently educated him, saying, “Everyone’s criticism of you, whether light or heavy, is for your own good. If you can’t accept criticism, you can’t progress. You’re a Communist Party member, you have to abide by discipline and set an example.” He also told him two stories about abiding by discipline. After listening, DaShui’s anger subsided, and he was convinced, saying, “Ha! You’re using a key to unlock my heart.”
    That evening, they held a Party meeting, and then a group meeting. DaShui admitted his mistakes; smiling, he said, “I’m a simpleton, I’ve finally understood. In the future, if I have any shortcomings, you can just point them out. I, Niu DaShui, will never lose my temper again.” Everyone laughed and said, “It’s okay to make mistakes as long as you correct them; you’ve made great progress.”
    DaShui made progress, and XiaoMei also made a lot of progress. Tian Ying wanted to introduce XiaoMei to the Party, so she asked her, “Do you think the Kuomintang is good or the Communist Party is good?” XiaoMei said, “Of course the Communist Party is good!” Tian Ying said, “Which party do you want to join?” XiaoMei said, “I don’t want to be in either party, I just want to resist Japan, anyway, I want to be a female Red Army soldier!” Before, XiaoMei knew that her brother-in-law, Hei Lao Cai, was a Communist Party member and was being chased around by the Kuomintang, XiaoMei was very scared. She saw that the female Red Army soldiers were very free. Tian Ying pulled her and said, “You’re so silly! Without the Communist Party, where would the Red Army come from? Now the name of the Red Army has been cancelled. When you’re in the Party, you have meetings all the time, you know more things, and you progress faster. Think it over carefully!”
    XiaoMei thought it over and over, and couldn’t make up her mind, so she went to discuss it with Niu DaShui. DaShui anxiously said, “Hey, you’re really confused! This is a very secret matter, why are you telling me?” He inadvertently revealed himself by saying, “Luckily I’m in the Party; otherwise, you would have ‘exposed’ yourself to others!” XiaoMei said fearfully, “What should I do now? You already know!” DaShui said very secretly, “Just join. When you’re in the Party, you’ll have a backbone.”
    When XiaoMei saw Tian Ying, she agreed to join. Sister Chen filled out a form for XiaoMei. There were more than a dozen people who joined the Party with XiaoMei, and they held an admission ceremony. Everyone swore an oath to the Party flag, to Chairman Mao's portrait... After that, she often attended Party classes with DaShui and the others.

    Seven
    One afternoon, a man came to the training class. He was of medium height, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, wearing a military uniform, with a gold tooth, and carrying a bundle. He came to find the person in charge. After Cheng Ping met with him, he politely asked, “Is there a woman in your school named Yang XiaoMei?” Cheng Ping said yes. The man introduced himself, saying that he served in the He Village Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force; and said, "Our regiment is led by Commander Lü. Comrade Yang XiaoMei is my wife, and I very much support her receiving training here; today I specifically came to see her and bring her something." Cheng Ping said, "Okay, wait a moment." And went out.
    Zhang Jinlong smoked three cigarettes in a row before Cheng Ping came, sizing him up and saying, "Yang XiaoMei doesn't want to see you. She says you always hit her." Zhang Jinlong smiled and said, "It's common for couples to quarrel and fight. I'm not her enemy, can she avoid me for life? Director Cheng, I'm also an Anti-Japanese soldier, tell me, is what she's doing reasonable or not!" Cheng Ping said, "We advocate marital harmony. If you want to see her, you must guarantee not to hit her!" Zhang Jinlong readily agreed. Cheng Ping then went to persuade Yang XiaoMei, and XiaoMei came.
    As soon as Zhang Jinlong saw XiaoMei, he grinned, asking her questions warmly; then he opened his bundle and took out a large coat, saying, "Put it on quickly. It's so cold, don't get cold!" XiaoMei had never seen him so nice to her, and her heart softened. Zhang Jinlong said, "Tell me what you need. After you put on the coat, let's go to a restaurant to eat." XiaoMei put on the coat, told Cheng Ping, and went with him.
    The sky was gloomy. There was no wind, but it was very cold. They went to a restaurant. Li LiuZi, the young boy, had already reserved a warm room, waiting for them. Zhang Jinlong ordered good wine and good food, inviting XiaoMei. During the meal, Zhang Jinlong said, “XiaoMei, you came out this time without discussing it with your family; once you ran away, relatives, friends, and neighbors all laughed at us! Where do you think I should put my face?” XiaoMei said, “I’m receiving training in an upright manner, and I’ll be doing Anti-Japanese work when I go out in the future, what’s shameful about that?” Zhang Jinlong said, “Hey! Women have long hair and short insight; what work can a woman do, isn't it just a waste of time! I think it’s better for you to come back with me, your family has a bowl of rice for you to eat!" XiaoMei understood his intentions, her face fell and she said, “I’m not going back! I’ll get beaten if I go back?” Zhang Jinlong said, “I’ve already talked to my mother about hitting you, and even me, it was just a moment of bad temper… Can you never go back!”
    XiaoMei had already lost her appetite, she stood up and said, “If I go back, it has to be after my training! Right now, it took me a lot of effort to get out here, I have to hurry back.” Zhang Jinlong grabbed her and pulled her back down, saying, "What's the rush!" XiaoMei anxiously watched them finish eating, Li LiuZi and the young boy walked out. Zhang Jinlong paid the bill, and said to XiaoMei, "You're coming home with me today! Let's go!" XiaoMei's eyes were full of tears and she said, "Even if I go, I have to tell the class!" Zhang Jinlong said, "I'll take care of that, you don't have to worry about it!" Saying that, he grabbed XiaoMei's arm and walked out.
    Reaching the restaurant entrance, XiaoMei saw that Li LiuZi and the young boy had already brought a horse, waiting. XiaoMei shed tears, both feet braced against the threshold, one arm propping against the doorframe, stubbornly refusing to leave. Zhang Jinlong pulled her and said, "Are you leaving or not? If you don't leave, I'll carry you back, I'll lift you back!" The restaurant staff and the idlers on the street came to watch. Zhang Jinlong took out his gun and shouted, "What are you looking at! This is my wife, I'm taking her home, what's so interesting to see? Go, go, go!" The crowd scattered, Li LiuZi and the young boy lifted XiaoMei onto the horse and led it away. Zhang Jinlong, carrying his gun, followed behind.
    The sky was even gloomier, with snowflakes falling softly. XiaoMei was riding on the horse, and she was beside herself with anxiety! Reaching the village entrance, she tumbled off the horse, fell on the ground, and began to wail. Zhang Jinlong poked her with the muzzle of his gun, and fiercely said, "Are you leaving or not? If you don't leave, I'll beat you to death!" XiaoMei wailed and said, "Even if you beat me to death, I won't go!" Zhang Jinlong unbuckled his belt, about to hit her, when he suddenly saw a lot of people running over there, led by Niu DaShui, clearly from the training class; seeing that things were not going well for him, Zhang Jinlong gritted his teeth, pointed at Yang XiaoMei and said, "Fine! You're tough! We'll see each other later!" After speaking, he jumped on the horse, taking Li LiuZi and the young boy, and ran away in a puff of smoke. (To be continued) (Attached pictures)
    Zhang Jinlong treated Yang XiaoMei to good food, coaxing her to go home.
    Niu DaShui said angrily: "I'll never smoke this damned tobacco again!" He snapped his pipe in half.
    The people from the training class chased after them, Zhang Jinlong said to XiaoMei, "Fine! You're tough! We'll see each other later!" He jumped on the horse and ran away in a puff of smoke.

    第二回　共产党（续三）
    开起讨论会来，这个小组里，就大水和小梅不言声。别人问：“你们怎么不发言呀？”大水说：“咱们一个庄稼脑袋，叫我说个庄稼话行喽，叫我发言，我知道怎么发呀？”小梅给人催急了，臊得她差点哭出来。大伙儿劝他们：“记得几句说几句，慢慢儿就学会啦！”大水好几夜翻过来，掉过去，睡不着觉，愁了个半病子。她对小梅说：“咱俩可是高粱地里耠子③，一道苗儿，两个傻蛋，往后受罢训回去，百吗也不懂，可怎么着？”小梅也愁蹙蹙的说：“谁说不是呀！咱们两个笨鸭子上不了架；受了一回子训，就装了一肚子小米饭，回去怎么见人哪？”大水说：“咱不信！人家是人，咱也是个人，咱就学不会？”每天，在休息的时间，程平教他们识字。大水晚上躺下，还在肚皮上画字呢。上课的时候，他硬着头皮听，慢慢的也就听出个意思来了。小组会上，大水下决心发言，蹩出一身汗，前言不搭后语，结结巴巴的说了一泼滩。小梅红着脸儿，也跟着学了几句。大伙儿都说：“好了好了，这两个可有了门儿啦！”
    大水可比谁都勤谨。每天，他起得最早，扫了院子扫屋子，把同志们的洗脸水漱口水都打好，等大家起了床，又把一个个铺盖卷儿折叠得整整齐齐的。在生活检讨会上，他闹了个模范；许多人都夸他。大水很不好意思，说：“咱们庄稼人，没什么旁的本事，就是会卖点力气。”后来程平同志在全体大会上，还提出牛大水的名字，表扬了一下。大水心里可乐啦。
    大水觉得自己有了进步，生怕小梅落了后，有一次学罢歌子，人散了，他问小梅：“你怎么着？生活过得惯？”小梅剪过的头发齐脖子，晒得黑红的脸儿，一笑就是两个酒窝儿；她可松快多了，活泼多了，两只大眼睛挺精神的瞧着大水，说：“怎么过不惯呀？”她把陈大姐跟她们说的话，照样儿搬了过来，说：“就得吃苦呢。咱们这是‘锻炼’！往后打日本，什么苦都要受得了呢！”大水听了，吃惊的想：“吓呀，小梅可进步多多啦！”小梅一跳一跳的走去，头发在风里飘，还唱“青年进行曲”呢：
    前进，
    中国的青年！
    挺战，
    中国的青年………
    【注】③耠子：是高粱的一种。

    这天，正上课呢，大水烟荷包里没烟了。熬了半天，怪难受，就偷偷溜出来，在门口糖摊上，买了两根烟卷儿。训练班的纪律很严，不许买烟卷儿抽。他不敢给人知道，就躲在毛厕里，假装大便，吸着烟卷儿过瘾。刚好有个同班的来解手，大水赶忙把烟卷儿＠灭，另一支也踩在脚底下蹴碎了。那同学可斜着眼睛看了个准，回去就报告了。
    晚上，开了个小组会，他们把大水批评得真够瞧。这个说：“你为什么不好好听课？”那个说：“你还有没有个纪律呀？”说得大水成了个大红脸，结结巴巴说：“我……我这是第一回呀！口袋里可一点儿烟也没有了。你们大家抬抬手，原个谅吧。”话还没有说完，人们就乱嚷开了。这儿也是：“报告主席，我对他有个意见！”那儿也是：“报告主席，我也有个意见……”真是：按倒葫芦瓢又起来了；都说牛大水不接受批评，不诚恳。连小梅也跟着嚷：“我也报告主席……”
    大水恼了，心里想：“抽个烟儿，犯了什么罪呀？”一赌气，掏出他的小烟袋说：“妈的，为了这么个事；以后一辈子不抽这个鸡巴烟了！”说着，把那烟袋在膝盖儿上喀嚓一下就抉折了；嘴里还气愤不平的说：“看我改了改不了！拿个中国人还没有这一点囊气！”说完把两截子烟袋扔在地上就走了。
    大水气得半夜没睡着，差点儿啼哭。第二天起来，他还蹩着这口气，谁也不理，连小梅跟他说话，他也不答腔。下午，程平把他叫去了。程平让他先说，大水气呼呼的诉说了一顿。程平笑了笑，很耐心的教育他，说：“大伙儿批评你，说轻说重都是为了你好，不能接受批评，就不能进步；你是个共产党员，更得守纪律，起模范啊。”还说了两个守纪律的故事给他听。大水听了以后，气也平了，心也服了，说：“哈！你这是拿钥匙，把我的心开了窍儿啦。”
    晚上，开了党的会，又开小组会。大水承认了不是；笑呵呵的说：“我是个实葫芦儿，这会儿才豁亮了。往后我有什么缺点儿，你们只管指出来。我牛大水可再不发我的牛脾气啦。”大伙儿都笑开了，说：“有错改错，也就没错了；你可大大进步啦。”
    大水进步，小梅也很有进步。田英想介绍小梅入党，就问她：“你看国民党好还是共产党好？”小梅说：“当然共产党好么！”田英说：“你愿意在哪个党？”小梅可说：“哪个党我也不在，我就知道抗日，反正我要当女红军！”以前小梅知道她姐夫黑老蔡是个共产党，给剿得东奔西跑，小梅很害怕。她看那些女红军，倒是很自在。田英拉着她说：“你真傻！没有共产党，哪里来的红军呀？现在红军的名儿也已经取消了。在了党，常开会，知道的事儿多，进步就快啦。你好好儿寻思寻思吧！”
    小梅想来想去，拿不定主意，就找牛大水商量。大水着急的说：“嗨，你这个人真糊涂！这是个最秘密的事儿么，你怎么告诉我呢？”他可不知不觉的暴露自己说：“幸亏我在了党；要不，你就‘暴露’给人家啦！”小梅害怕的说：“那怎么办呢？已经给你知道啦！”大水很秘密的说：“你就参加吧。在了党，可就有了主心骨啦。”
    小梅见到田英，就同意参加了。陈大姐给小梅填了表。和小梅一块儿入党的有十几个人，举行了入党仪式，大家对党旗、对毛主席的像宣了誓……以后，就常跟大水他们一块儿上党课。
    七
    一天下午，训练班来了一个人，中等个子，二十七八，穿了一身军装，镶着一颗金牙，夹个包袱，来找负责同志。程平接见以后，他很客气的问：“贵校学员里，有个妇女叫杨小梅的吧？”程平说有。那人介绍自己，说是在何庄抗日自卫团服务；又说：“我们这个团是吕司令领导的。杨小梅同志是我内人，他在这儿受训我是很赞成的；今天我特意来看看她，给她捎点儿东西。”程平说：“可以，你等一等。”就走出去了。
    张金龙一连吸了三支烟，程平才来了，打量着他说：“杨小梅不愿意见你，她说你尽打她。”张金龙笑着说：“两口子吵嘴打架，也是常有的事。我又不是她的仇人，她能一辈子不见我吗？程主任，我也是个抗日军人，你说吧，她这样做合理不合理！”程平说：“我们是主张夫妻和睦的，你要想见她也可以，你可得保证不打她！”张金龙满口答应。程平就去说服了杨小梅，小梅来了。
    张金龙一见小梅，就嘻着个嘴，问长问短，很是亲热；又打开包袱，拿出一件大袄说：“快穿上吧。天这么冷，别冻着了！”小梅从来没见他这么好过呀，心就软了。张金龙说：“缺什么你就说。穿了大袄，咱们到馆子里吃饭去。”小梅穿好大袄，和程平说了一声，就跟他去了。
    天，阴沉沉的。没有风，可是很冷。他俩到了一家饭馆。李六子小小子先占了一间暖呼呼的房，在等他们呢。张金龙叫了好酒好菜，请小梅。吃饭中间，张金龙说：“小梅，你这回出来，跟家里没有商量；你一跑，亲戚朋友，街坊邻居，谁不笑话咱！你看我这个脸往哪儿搁呀？”小梅说：“我这是正二八摆的受训，将来出去作抗日工作，有什么丢人的？”张金龙说：“嗨！女人头发长，见识短；一个妇道人家能作什么工作哟，还不是白受罪！我看你不抵跟我回去，家里有你一碗饭吃！”小梅明白了他的心意，沉下脸儿说：“我不回去！我回去挨打呀？”张金龙说：“我娘打你，我已经说过他了，就是我，也是一时脾气不好……你还能老不回去吗！”
    小梅早就吃不下去了，站起身说：“要回去，也得等我受罢训！这会儿，我出来的工夫大了，我得忙回去。”张金龙一把拉她坐下说：“忙什么！”小梅着急的看他们吃完饭，李六子和小小子走出去了。张金龙付了帐，对小梅说：“你今天就跟我回家！咱们走吧！”小梅急得眼泪汪汪的说：“就是走，我也得跟班上说一声啊。”张金龙说：“那边我负责，你不用管！”说着，拉住小梅的胳膊就往外走。
    走到饭馆门口，小梅看见李六子、小小子早拉着一匹马，在等着了。小梅流下了眼泪，两支脚蹬着门坎儿，一支胳膊撑着门框，死赖着不走。张金龙拉着她说：“你走不走？你不走，我驮也把你驮回去，抬也把你抬回去！”饭铺的伙计和街上的闲人都来看。张金龙掏出枪来，喝着说：“你们看什么！这是我的媳妇，我接她家去，有什么好看的？走走走！”人们一闪开，李六子和小小子把小梅架上马，拉着就走。张金龙提着枪，跟在后面。
    天更阴了，絮絮的飘着雪花。小梅骑在马上，可急得没法了呀！到了村口，她一骨碌从马上滚下来，跌在地上，嚎开了。张金龙用枪头子戳着她，凶狠狠的说：“你走不走？不走我打死你！”小梅嚎着说：“你打死我，我也不走了！”张金龙解下皮带，正要打她，忽然看见那边好些人呼呼呼的跑过来，头前是个牛大水，分明都是训练班的人；一看势头不对，张金龙咬着牙，指着杨小梅说：“好！你厉害！咱们以后瞧吧！”说完，跳上马，带着李六子、小小子，一溜烟跑了。（未完）（附图片）
    张金龙请杨小梅吃好的，哄她回家。
    牛大水赌气说：“再不抽这鸡巴烟了！”他一下就把烟袋抉折了。
    训练班的人追来，张金龙对小梅说：“好！你厉害！咱们以后瞧吧！”跳上马，一溜烟跑了。
