Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 22nd: After the liberation of the Huainan Coal Mine, through the concerted efforts of both new and old employees, the daily coal production has increased from over 1,000 tons in March to over 3,100 tons currently. Furthermore, a new coal seam, two and a half meters thick, has been discovered in the southern part of the Datong Mine, which belongs to the coal mine. The previously known underground reserves of this mine could only sustain one or two more years of mining and were about to be depleted. This discovery will greatly extend the mining life of the mine. The mine's experiment of using sodium sulfate instead of potassium sulfate for charging and supplying safety lamps used in the mine has also been successful, thus eliminating the dependence on foreign raw materials. In addition, employees have also used old machine parts and materials to add a power plant with a generating capacity of 2,000 kilowatts.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 22nd: After the Wujin Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army resumed work at the Qishuyan Railway Machinery Plant, attention was paid to educating the plant's employees and specifically addressing their living difficulties, which has gradually improved the employees' political awareness and production enthusiasm. The number of workers at the plant has increased from over 1,000 per day at the beginning of the resumption to over 2,400. Since the resumption of work, two locomotives, six freight and passenger cars, and one jeep and one motorcycle have been repaired. Although enemy planes frequently harass, many workers do not easily leave their posts unless they hear an emergency alarm. At the beginning of the resumption of work, some workers were not enthusiastic about their work, for two reasons: first, the workers' wages had been withheld by the Kuomintang Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration since April 11, and the rapidly depreciating bogus currency made the workers' lives particularly difficult; second, enemy planes harassed from time to time, making the workers uneasy. After understanding the above situation, the Military Control Commission first advanced the workers 16 million yuan in people's currency and instructed the Wujin Office of the People's Bank to exchange the bogus gold yuan for employees at a preferential exchange rate. At the same time, the Military Control Commission mobilized farmers to transport rice and grain, and the staff of the workers' work team also personally assisted the employees in purchasing nearly 1,000 dan of rice in Wuxi, Wujin, and other places, allowing the employees to purchase food at prices lower than the market price, thus solving the most important living difficulties. Regarding air defense, the work team organized the employees in the factory into an air defense brigade, dug air raid shelters, and installed alarm devices to gradually stabilize the employees' morale. At the same time, the Military Control Commission and the staff of the workers' work team flexibly seized the gaps in time to explain the Communist Party's economic and labor policies to the employees through meetings, individual talks, and other means. The employees all expressed satisfaction.

　　淮南煤矿发现新煤层
    开采年限大为延长
  　戚墅堰铁路机厂工人积极生产
    【新华社合肥二十二日电】淮南煤矿解放后，经新旧职工的一致努力，除每日产煤量由三月份的一千多吨增至现在的三千一百多吨外，并在该矿所属之大通矿场南部发现了二公尺半厚的新煤层一处。该矿场原已测知的地下蕴藏量，只能再供一、二年之开采，即将告罄。经此发现后，该矿开采年限，将大为延长。该矿试验以硫酸钠代替硫酸钾冲电供应矿井中使用的保险电灯，亦获得成功，从此可免除对外国原料的依赖。此外，职工们还利用旧机件材料，增加了发电量二千千瓦的电厂一座。
    【新华社无锡二十二日电】人民解放军武进军管会在戚墅堰铁路机厂复工后，因为注意对该厂职工进行教育与具体解决他们的生活困难，已使该厂职工政治觉悟与生产情绪逐渐提高。该厂上工人数，已由复工开始时的每天一千多人，增至二千四百多人。复工以来已修好机车两台，货车客车六节，及吉普、摩托卡各一辆。虽然敌机经常滋扰，但很多工人除非听到紧急警报，不轻易离开岗位。复工开始时，一部分工人工作情绪不高，原因有二：一是工人工资自四月十一日以后即为国民党京沪铁路管理局克扣未发，加以伪币迅速贬值，工人生活特别困难；一是敌机时来骚扰，工人不安。军管会了解上述情况后，首先给工人借支工资一千六百万元人民券，并责成人民银行武进办事处按优待比价，为职工兑换伪金圆券。同时军管会又动员农民贩运米粮，职工工作队人员亦亲自协助职工到无锡、武进等地买米近一千石，使职工以低于市场的价格购入食粮，解决了最重要的生活困难。关于防空，工作队把厂内员工组成了防空大队，掘好防空壕，设置警报器，使职工的情绪逐渐稳定。同时，军管会及职工工作队人员又灵活地抓紧空隙时间，以会议、个别谈话等方式向员工们讲解共产党的经济政策和劳动政策。职工们都表示满意。
