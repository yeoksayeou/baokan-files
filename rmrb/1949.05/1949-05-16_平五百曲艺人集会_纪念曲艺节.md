　　Ping Five Hundred Ballad Singers Gather to Commemorate Ballad Art Festival
　　[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday (the 18th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar) was the first "Ballad Art Festival" in the city of Beiping. More than five hundred ballad singers from the entire city gathered at the Yaowang Temple outside Chongwenmen at 10:00 AM to commemorate their own festival. In the past, this day was when ballad singers worshipped their ancestral master (said to be King Zhuang of Zhou). Every performer had to go to the temple to burn incense and kowtow. After liberation, the thinking of the performers gradually progressed, and they believed that the past practices were too superstitious and wasteful, so they changed this day to the Ballad Art Festival as a day for everyone to gather. At the meeting, Comrade Ma Yanxiang of the Cultural Department of the Cultural Management Committee pointed out in his speech that performers should change the superstitious notion of "the ancestral master bestowing food" and the idea of fate, otherwise it would hinder their own progress and they would forget their skills. Reputation is earned through years of struggle and training. Today's commemoration of the Ballad Art Festival requires studying, critiquing, developing, and utilizing the legacy left by predecessors (ballad art techniques). In the past, performers served feudal landlords and the ruling class. Today, the people are the masters, and everyone should reform the old things of the past, write new drum lyrics that are beneficial to society, and work to educate the masses. Comrade Ma also announced two pieces of news on the spot: (1) A National Literary and Art Representatives Conference will be held in Beiping in June this year, and the Beiping ballad art community can recommend one representative to participate. (2) A drama performance conference, including various dramas, will be held during the conference. The ballad art community will jointly perform with Beiping artists, as well as artists from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region and Shijiazhuang artists who have achieved considerable success in reform. Cao Shilu, the president of the Ballad Art Association, said: In the future, performers should strengthen their learning, starting from the bottom up, beginning with members of the Kunshu societies in the Tianqiao area and mobile members. Each Kunshu society has a dozen or so performers, and the audience in the Tianqiao area is relatively large, having a great impact. It is best for each Kunshu society to establish literacy classes, with literate people teaching illiterate people, or reading the newspaper to everyone. In the future, not only should they learn to read, but they should also instill political thought, stipulating that a meeting be held every month or every week after the performance, which can be held separately at appropriate locations in the east, west, and south cities, inviting comrades from the Cultural Management Committee to speak. After the meeting, the Ballad Art Association held a board of directors meeting and elected storytelling artist Lian Kuoru as the Beiping ballad art representative to attend the National Literary and Art Representatives Conference.

　　平五百曲艺人集会
  　纪念曲艺节
    【本报讯】昨天（旧历四月十八日）是北平市第一个“曲艺节”，全市五百多曲艺人于上午十时在崇外药王庙开大会，纪念自己的节日。在过去，这一天是曲艺人祭祖师爷（据说是周庄王）的日子，每个艺人都要到庙里烧香磕头。解放后，艺人的思想逐渐进步，认为过去的作法太迷信，太浪费，所以把这天改为曲艺节，作为大家聚会的日子。会上，文管会文艺部马彦祥同志讲话中指出，艺人应改变过去“祖师爷赏饭吃”的迷信观念和命运思想，否则会阻碍自己的进步，会忘掉自己的技术。名誉是自己多少年奋斗锻炼出来的。今天纪念曲艺节要研究与批判的发扬运用前辈遗留下的财产（曲艺技术）。过去艺人的表演是给封建地主、统治阶级服务的，今天人民作了主人，大家要改革过去旧的东西，编写对社会有益的新的鼓辞演唱，作教育群众的工作。马同一志并当场宣布两个消息：（一）今年六月在北平举行全国文艺代表会，北平曲艺界平可推派一名代表参加。（二）大会开会期间举行戏剧演出大会，包括各种戏剧。曲艺界将由已改革有相当成绩的冀鲁豫边区艺人和石家庄艺人与北平艺人共同演出。曲艺公会会长曹实禄说：今后艺人要加强学习，由下往上作起，先由天桥一带的坤书社的会员和流动的会员开头，每一坤书社有十几个艺人，天栏一带听众又比较多，影响极大，各坤书社最好成立识字班，由识字的教不识字的，或者读报给大家听。以后不仅要学习识字，还要贯输政治思想，规定每一个月或每一个星期在散场后开一次会，可在东、西、南各城适中地点分别举行，请文管会同志讲话。会后，曲艺公会开理监事会，推选评书艺人连阔如为出席全国文艺代表大会的北平曲界艺代表。
