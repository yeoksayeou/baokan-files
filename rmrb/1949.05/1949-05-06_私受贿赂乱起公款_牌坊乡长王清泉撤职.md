Privately Accepting Bribes and Misappropriating Public Funds
Pai Fang Township Chief Wang Qingquan Dismissed
[Ping City News] Wang Qingquan, the township chief of Pai Fang Township in the Fifteenth District of Ping Suburban Area, was dismissed for accepting bribes from landlords and wasting public money. Wang was originally a poor peasant, and his work was good in the early days of liberation, but due to his unstable stance, he accepted bribes (corn, etc.) from local landlords such as Zhao Hengqi. Zhao then placed his nephew Zhao Bingchun in the township government to work. The rich peasant Li Guimao also took the opportunity to mix in, deliberately wasting public money and manpower, and instigating the collection of funds from the masses to build the township government (8,500 yuan had already been collected). When the district work team discovered and stopped this, Wang not only did not realize his mistake, but also threatened to "quit" and refused to comply. In addition, the township government sent farmers to serve every day (actually to serve Wang, Zhao, Li, etc.); they were also extremely unconcerned when farmers went to the township government to ask questions or handle affairs, even scolding them harshly or ignoring them. The landlords and rich peasants even clamored: "Money makes the world go round, we'll tell you (referring to the masses) to go east and you can't go west." The masses were extremely dissatisfied. Now the district government has decided to dismiss Wang Qingquan from his post as township chief and keep him in the peasant association to reflect on his mistakes.
    Editor's note: Dismissing Wang Qingquan is correct, but it is not known whether the landlord and rich peasant elements who manipulated the regime have been purged. These elements should be resolutely purged.

    私受贿赂乱起公款
    牌坊乡长王清泉撤职
    【平市讯】平郊十五区牌坊乡乡长王清泉，受地主贿赂，浪费民财，已受撤职处分。王本贫农，解放初期，工作尚好，但因立场不稳，受了该乡地主赵恒起等之贿赂（玉米等物），赵即将侄赵炳春放入乡公所工作，富农李贵茂亦乘机混入，即故意浪费民财民力，唆使向群众敛款修建乡政府（已敛八千五百元）。区工作组发觉制止时，王不但不知自觉，反以“不干”来要挟，拒绝遵办。此外，乡公所每天派农民去服务（实际是伺候王、赵、李等）；农民去乡公所问事、办事、也极不关心，甚至恶声叱咤，或不予理睬。地主、富农更扬言：有钱买得鬼推磨，叫你们（指群众）往东就不能往西。群众极为不满。现区政府已决定将王清泉撤消乡长职务，留在农会反省检讨。
    编者按：撤销王清泉的职务是正确的，但不知操纵政权的地主富农分子是否清洗了，这些分子是应该坚决清洗的。
