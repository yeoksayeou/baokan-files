    The historically significant decisions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding literature and art have played a decisive role in the new upsurge of Soviet literature. Thanks to the Party's correct leadership in direction, our art and literature have achieved great accomplishments in various forms - prose, poetry, drama, and film.

    The Central Committee's decision regarding the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad" clearly stipulated the role and position of magazines in the ideological work of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. This decision greatly benefited our literary and artistic magazines. The editorial departments of various literary and artistic magazines have improved their work, begun to more strictly review publications, and further concerned themselves with the high ideological quality and artistic value of published works. This has enhanced the magazines' role in educating the masses in the spirit of communism and their prestige among a broad readership.

    However, not all magazines have learned the lessons they should have from the decision regarding "Zvezda" and "Leningrad." In inspecting the implementation of this decision, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) heard the summary report of the editorial department of "Znamya" magazine and made a decision stating that the editorial department of "Znamya" magazine had not completed the tasks it was responsible for and had committed a series of serious errors in its work.

    In 1948, "Znamya" magazine lowered the ideological and artistic quality of published works, and published a series of ideologically flawed and artistically inferior works.

    The magazine's biggest mistake was publishing Melnikov's novella "The Editorial Department," which distorted the image of our front-line journalists and praised the image of war criminals. In Kazakevich's novella "Partners in the Steppe," the author emotionally defended the serious crime of a coward who led his troops to destruction. Yanovsky's short stories "The Doctor's Heart" and "Blind Happiness" lost the truth of life and were purely based on the decadent grief copied from samples of decadent bourgeois literature. The editorial department did not guide the poets' attention to the combat themes of our era, but instead supported some poets in moving towards the narrow world of individualistic trifles.

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that the publication of works like these proved that the line implemented by the editorial department of "Znamya" magazine in the recent period was incorrect. "The editorial department deviated from the principle of Bolshevik partisanship in literature, forgot that literature is a powerful weapon for the ideological education of the Soviet people, ignored the truth of life, and allowed many pages to be used by certain authors to portray backward and incompetent characters and then to render them as all sorts of heroes."

    In the Party Central Committee's decision, it was particularly pointed out that the magazine's literary criticism was unsatisfactory. The articles published in the magazine were of a low level, and the evaluations of literary works were often wrong, thus confusing the writers' vision and leading them onto the wrong path. In Kostelyanets's article on Panova's novel "Kruzhelikha," he ridiculed the Soviet readers' correct and natural desire to see the protagonists in our articles as perfect and spiritually healthy characters. The author of the article contemptuously ridiculed the protagonists in the novel who did not have certain ideological defects as "perfectly ironed" characters. In Runin's article on Konovalov's novel "University," the ideological perseverance of the protagonists in the novel and the representatives of advanced Soviet science was denounced as a sign of their incompetence.

    The magazine did not raise the pressing issues of our social and literary life, and did not do enough to help expose bourgeois "cosmopolitanism," and did not actively struggle against formalism and naturalism in literature.

    The Party Central Committee pointed out that the working methods of the editorial board itself were also incorrect. The editorial department relied on a small group of critics, weakened its work with authors, and sloppily proofread manuscripts. Within the editorial department, there was a lack of criticism and self-criticism, and complacency and self-satisfaction prevailed. All warnings about the many serious ideological errors in the works published in the magazine were ignored.

    "Znamya" magazine's mistakes, - the decision stated, - were also the result of the Secretariat of the Soviet Writers' Union of the USSR not providing strong leadership to the editorial department.

    The Party Central Committee acknowledged that the work of the editorial board of "Znamya" magazine in 1948 was unsatisfactory, made a decision to strengthen the magazine, and instructed the editorial board and the Secretariat of the Soviet Writers' Union to correct the magazine's shortcomings and errors.

    The most important task of the editorial board of "Znamya" magazine, as considered by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), is to unite the well-known Soviet writers, literary critics, and commentators who are capable of correcting the magazine's line around the magazine, to raise the magazine's ideological and artistic level, and to actively uphold the principle of Bolshevik partisanship in creation.

    The magazine should publish works that truly and clearly reflect real life on the road of revolutionary development and explore the new and lofty qualities of the Soviet people - the builders of communism.

    The decision regarding "Znamya" magazine once again proves the Party and Comrade Stalin's constant concern for the fate of Soviet literature and its lofty mission. This decision has principled significance for the creation of all Soviet literary figures. The erroneous practices of "Znamya" magazine clearly show that once the main aspect - Bolshevik partisanship - is forgotten, it will inevitably lead to lack of principle, sectarianism, and will enable the open and hidden apologists of those reactionary literary "sects" to become active.

    The great principle of Bolshevik partisanship is the source of Soviet literature's creativity. Faithfulness to this Leninist-Stalinist principle, and the resolute implementation of the instructions of the Party Central Committee, is the guarantee of the successful development of our literature and art.

    The summary of the Soviet Writers' Union Board meeting that closed not long ago also proved this. At that meeting, the state of Armenian, Latvian, and Caucasian literature, as well as drama and film, was discussed.

    The achievements in these areas are mainly due to the fact that advanced playwrights, scriptwriters, and drama and film workers have recognized and consciously observed the Party's instructions in their creations. However, as pointed out in the resolution of the conference, the current state of drama is still unsatisfactory, and the achievements in Soviet film are far from sufficient. The backwardness of drama and film is the main obstacle to the continued development of Soviet drama culture and film art.

    The most important reason for the backwardness of drama and film is, first and foremost, the insufficient connection between writers and the practical work and daily labor of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals.

    The conference called on our writers to create ideological and highly artistic scripts for our theaters and new film scripts suitable for the needs of the people.

    By resolutely adhering to the principle of Bolshevik partisanship, bravely going into life, enthusiastically supporting the new communist things in life, abandoning the remnants that hinder progress, and waging a resolute struggle against formalism, aestheticism, and the phenomenon of flattery towards the Western bourgeoisie, Soviet writers, playwrights, and drama and film workers will surely create new works that truly and clearly reflect real life on the road of revolutionary development, and explore the new and lofty qualities of the Soviet people who are building a communist society under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin.

    Raise high the banner of Bolshevik partisanship in Soviet literature!

    布尔塞维克党性的伟大原则
    苏联文学报社论
    联共（布）中央关于文学与艺术的有历史意义的决定，对于苏维埃文学的新的高涨，起了决定性的作用。由于党在方向上的正确领导，在我们艺术与文学的各种作用——散文、诗歌、戏剧和电影中，都获得了巨大的成就。
    党中央关于“星”与“列宁格勒”两杂志的决定，明确地规定了杂志在布尔塞维克党和苏维埃国家的思想工作中的作用和地位，这一决定对我们文艺杂志有极大的裨益。各文艺杂志底编辑部改进了自己的工作，开始了更严格地审查出版物，进一步地关心已发表的作品底高度的思想质量与艺术价值。这就提高了杂志在以共产主义精神教育群众的事业上的作用及其在广大读者中的威信。
    然而并不是所有一切杂志，都从关于“星”与“列宁格勒”两杂志的决定中，吸取了应有的教训。联共（布）中央在检查此一决定的执行中，听取了“旗”杂志编辑部的总结报告，同时作出了决定，其中指出“旗”杂志编辑部没有完成它所担负的任务，并在工作中犯了一系列的严重的错误。
    一九四八年，“旗”杂志降低了已发表的作品底思想、艺术的质量，刊载了一系列的思想上有缺陷的，在艺术方面是劣等的作品。
    杂志的最大错误，就是发表了麦尔尼科夫的中篇“编辑部”，该作歪曲了我前线新闻工作人员的面貌，表扬了战争罪犯的形象。在卡察克维奇的中篇“草原的伙伴”里，作者在感情上竟然替将部队引向灭亡的怕死鬼的严重罪恶辩护。雅诺夫斯基的短篇“医生的心”和“盲目的幸福”，失去了生活的真实性，纯粹建筑在从颓废的资产阶级文学样本中抄袭过来的穷途末路的哀思上。编辑部没有把诗人的注意力引导到我们时代底战斗的题材上，反支持了一部份诗人走向个人主义的杂的狭小世界去了。
    联共（布）中央指出，类似这些作品的发表，证明最近一个时期“旗”杂志编辑部所实行的路线是不正确的。“编辑部离开了文学底布尔塞维克党性底原则，忘记了文学乃是苏维埃人民思想教育底强大武器，忽视了生活的真实性，并让出了许多篇幅供某些作者在描写落后的与低能的人物时又将他们渲染成各式各样的英雄”。
    在党中央决定中，特别指出了杂志上关于文学批评方面的不能令人满意的状况。杂志上发表的文章水平很低，对文学作品的评价常是错误的，因而混淆了作家的视线，并把他们引上了错误的道路。在科斯杰良茨论潘诺瓦的小说“克鲁热里哈”的文章里，嘲笑苏维埃读者的这一正确的与自然的愿望：看到我们文章里的主人公都是完美的、精神上是健康的人物。该文作者把小说里没有某些思想缺陷的主人公，轻蔑地戏谑为“熨得四平八稳的”人物。在鲁宁论科诺瓦洛夫的小说“大学”的文章里、小说里的主人公和先进的苏维埃科学代表们的思想上的坚忍精神，被非难为是他们的低能的标志。
    杂志没有把我国社会与文学生活的迫切问题提出来，对于帮助揭露资产阶级“世界主义”的工作做的非当不够，没有同文学上的形式主义与自然主义作积极的斗争。
    党中央指出了编委会的工作作法本身也是不正确的。编辑部依靠一小批的批评家，削弱了对作者进行工作，污七八糟地校改手稿。在编辑部里，缺乏批评和自我批评，高枕无忧与自满自足占了上风。关于在杂志上所发表的作品里许多严重的思想错误的一切警告，是被忽视了的。
    “旗”杂志的错误，——决定里说道，——也是苏联苏维埃作家协会书记处对编辑部没有坚强领导的结果。
    党中央承认一九四八年“旗”杂志编委会的工作，是不能令人满意的，作出了关于加强该杂志的决定，并责成编委会和苏维埃作家协会书记处来纠正杂志的缺点和错误。
    联共（布）中共认为“旗”杂志编委会最重要的任务，是要把有能力纠正杂志路线的苏维埃著名的作家、文艺批评家和评论家团结到杂志的周围，提高杂志的思想和艺术水平，积极地坚持创作上的布尔塞维克党性的原则。
    杂志上应发表一些真实而明朗地在革命的发展道路上反映现实生活和发掘苏维埃人们——共产主义建设者底新的崇高品质的作品。
    关于“旗”杂志的决定，又一次证明了党和斯大林同志不断关心苏维埃文学底命运及其崇高的使命。此一决定对于全体苏维埃文学家的创作，有着原则性的意义。“旗”杂志底错误的作法，显然说明：一经忘记了主要的方面——布尔塞维克党性，即会不可避免地引导到无原则性、闹小宗派，会使那些反动文学“派”的公开的和隐藏的护教者们积极地活动起来。
    布尔塞维克党性的伟大原则，就是苏维埃文学创造力的源泉。忠实于这一列宁、斯大林的原则，坚决贯彻党中央的指示，是我们的文学和艺术顺利发展的保证。
    不久以前闭幕的苏维埃作家协会理事会议上的总结，同样也证明了这一点，在该会议上，讨论了阿尔明尼亚、拉脱维亚和高加索的文学以及戏剧与电影的状况。
    这些方面成绩的获得，主要是由于先进的戏剧家、脚本作者、戏剧和电影工作者，在自己创作中认清了并自觉地遵守了党的指示。然而，如在大会的决议里指出的，目前戏剧的状况仍是不能令人满意的，而苏维埃电影上的成就更是远远不够。戏剧、电影的落后，是苏维埃戏剧文化和电影艺术继续发展的主要障碍。
    戏剧和电影落后的最重要原因，首先是作家同工人、集体农民和知识分子的实际工作和日常劳动的联系不够。
    大会号召我国作家为我们剧院创作有思想的、有高度艺术性的剧本和新的适合人民要求的电影脚本。
    坚决遵守布尔塞维克党性的原则，勇敢地到生活中去，热烈拥护生活里的新的共产主义的事物，抛弃障碍前进的残余，在同形式主义、唯美主义和在西方资产阶级面前的阿谀现象作坚决的斗争中，苏维埃作家、戏剧家、戏剧和电影工作者一定会创造出新的作品，这些作品真实而明朗地在革命的发展道路上反映现实生活，发掘在列宁、斯大林党领导下建设共产主义社会的苏维埃人们的新的崇高品质。
    在苏维埃文学中，高高举起布尔塞维克党性的旗帜吧！
