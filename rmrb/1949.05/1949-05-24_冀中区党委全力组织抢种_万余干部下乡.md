　　Jizhong District Party Committee Fully Organizes Emergency Planting
　　Over Ten Thousand Cadres Go to the Countryside
　　Jinzhong Region Experiences General Abundant Rainfall
　　[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong region experienced general abundant rainfall. The District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and various mass organizations promptly issued a joint directive "Regarding the Full-Scale Development of Autumn Field Planting." The directive called on all levels of Party, government, military, and civilian cadres in the entire region to urgently mobilize and devote themselves to this movement. All organs and organizations, except for essential personnel remaining in the offices, were to set out and carry out an autumn field planting blitz week from now until the end of the month. All cadres remaining in the offices, livestock and horses from all organs, and all higher and primary schools, would, according to local needs, help the local farmers with three days of emergency planting and conduct production propaganda. Regarding leadership methods, it was pointed out that it is necessary to grasp the key points according to different regions and different amounts of rainfall. The focus should be on increasing the planting of peanuts and oil crops, ensuring the completion of the established plan. In response to the shortage of seeds, the masses should be mobilized to help each other with loans, and all shops and supply and marketing cooperatives should quickly lend out the remaining seeds in a simple and rapid manner. It was also advocated to select and soak seeds, and to plant more early-maturing crops such as yams and vegetables to supplement the autumn grain. After the directive was issued, more than 10,000 cadres from the District Party Committee level Party, government, military, and civilians, as well as various organs in Baoding City, were promptly organized into five large teams to go to the countryside for emergency planting. It was also decided in the helping with cultivation that: (1) It is necessary to be hardworking and endure hardship. Cadres from all organs should bring their own bedding, rice, and grain to reduce the trouble for the masses in taking care of us, and decline invitations from the masses for water, meals, and other hospitality. (2) Take care of agricultural tools and seeds. Organs with agricultural tools should bring their own, and should not waste or eat a single peanut seed from the masses, and this should be regarded as a matter of mass discipline. (3) Conduct propaganda anytime and anywhere, and practically promote the method of soaking seeds. It was decided that on the 23rd, they would go to Qingyuan, Anxin, and villages near Baoding to carry out the blitz.
　　[Jinzhong Electric] Jinzhong experienced general abundant rainfall, and farmers throughout the region have launched an upsurge in emergency planting. According to reports from various places, abundant rainfall occurred throughout the region from Wutai in the north to Jiexiu in the south, and from Yuxian in the east to the border mountains of Fenyang in the west on the 21st. The heaviest rainfall was in Shouyang, reaching about four inches, and the least was in Pingyao, also exceeding one inch. Other counties generally received two to three inches. The masses in various places were overjoyed by the sudden rain after a long drought, and their morale immediately soared. The masses who had planted in dry land were even more happy, saying, "It's great, it's just the right time!" Many villages were actively preparing seeds and repairing agricultural tools on the day of the rain; production mutual aid groups were discussing how to seize the time for planting. The masses in Dongnie Village, Yuci, compared the emergency planting after the rain to fighting a battle, saying that they must not miss the opportunity! The masses in the eastern, northern, Nanshansi, and Beishansi villages of Taigu County went to the fields before dawn on the 22nd to help each other replant and rush to plant. Those lacking livestock power organized people to pull seed drills, dig holes for planting, or plant in ditches.
