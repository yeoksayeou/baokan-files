Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 20th. Our correspondent Liu Baiyu reports: When the People's Liberation Army entered Wuhan on the afternoon of the 16th, it was enthusiastically welcomed by the people of the three towns. The peasants who welcomed them in the suburbs were so excited that they kept saying, "You're here! You're here!" When the mighty ranks of the People's Liberation Army entered the city of Hankou, workers, students, and citizens who had been waiting for a long time immediately rushed forward, and the big red flags of welcome were immediately hoisted on the top of the city's tallest buildings. Slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army were posted everywhere in the city, one of which read: "May 16th is the day Wuhan was reborn!" Just the day before, the people of the three towns of Wuhan were still in deep disaster. The sound of explosions from the war criminal Bai Chongxi's destruction of the Yangtze River ferry and railway equipment shook the three towns from the afternoon of the 14th to the morning of the 16th. These crimes of the Kuomintang bandit army aroused the hatred of the people of Wuhan, and they felt infinite joy and comfort at the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. On the main street in the center of Hankou, workers and students carried huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, twisting the Yangko dance to their heart's content, and many women rushed to offer flowers to the PLA soldiers passing by on the street. An old worker suddenly squeezed out of the crowd, rushed to the jeep of the People's Liberation Army, grabbed the hand of a PLA soldier and said excitedly: "Finally, this day has come!" The crowd thronged the troops forward, forming a procession extending for twenty li. All along the way were cheers and firecrackers. Workers and students in Wuchang, across the river from Hankou, heard the news of the People's Liberation Army's arrival in Hankou and immediately drove small boats across the river to welcome the People's Liberation Army. The electrical workers, who had been carrying out the factory protection struggle, stepped up their work to supply electricity. At night, the whole city was as bright as day, and the streets continued to be filled with jubilant crowds.

　　武汉复活的日子
    刘白羽
    【新华社汉口二十日电】本社记者刘白羽报道：人民解放军在十六日下午进驻武汉时，受到三镇人民的狂热欢迎。在市郊欢迎的农民都兴奋得只是连声地说：“你们来了！你们来了！”当浩浩荡荡的解放军行列开入汉口市内时，迎候已久的工人、学生和市民立即拥上前来，欢迎的大红旗也顿时飘扬在全市最高的建筑物顶上。市内到处贴着各种欢迎解放军的标语，其中有一条写着：“五一六是武汉复活的日子！”仅仅在前一天，武汉三镇的人民还处在深沉的灾难中。战犯白匪崇禧破坏长江轮渡和铁路设备的爆炸声从十四日下午直到十六日上午震动着三镇。国民党匪军的这些罪行引起武汉人民的痛恨，对解放军的到来更感到无限的欢欣和安慰。在汉口市中心的大街上，工人们和学生们抬着毛主席和朱总司令的巨像尽情地扭着秧歌，许多妇女们争先恐后地将鲜花献给在街上通过的解放军的战士们。一个老工人突然从人群中挤出来，扑到解放军的吉普车跟前，拉着解放军战士的手激动地说：“终于盼到这一天了！”人群簇拥着部队前进，形成延长二十里的游行行列。沿路是一片欢呼声和鞭炮声，汉口对岸的武昌的工人们和学生们听到解放军到达汉口的消息，立即驾着小船渡过江来，欢迎解放军。一直进行着护厂斗争的电业工人，加紧工作，供应电力。入夜，全市照耀如同白昼，街头继续沸腾着狂欢的人流。
