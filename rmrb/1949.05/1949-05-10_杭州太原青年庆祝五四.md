Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: Youth in newly liberated major cities such as Hangzhou and Taiyuan joyfully celebrated the May Fourth Youth Day. Hangzhou was liberated on the 3rd, and the next evening, more than four thousand students from twenty-one universities and middle schools held a grand gathering in the Zhejiang University Square. The venue was covered with slogans such as "Celebrate the Liberation of Hangzhou" and "Welcome the People's Liberation Army." A huge portrait of Chairman Mao, secretly painted by the students twenty days earlier, hung on the stage. The sound of new songs filled the air: "The People's Army has arrived, mighty and unstoppable, watering their horses in the Yangtze!" Before the meeting, the students engaged in free activities, some performing Yangge dances, others reciting poems celebrating liberation. When talking to reporters, many couldn't help but recall the persecution they suffered under Kuomintang rule. They said that during last year's May Fourth, they were under the threat of "prohibition of gatherings." Many students "disappeared" during those days. When Zhejiang University students held a memorial meeting, they had to post sentries at the gate to prevent attacks by special agents. Today, however, they can freely celebrate the holiday of freedom. During the meeting, Political Commissar Zhao of a PLA unit that liberated Hangzhou was invited to speak. He particularly praised the Hangzhou students for their heroic struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries in the patriotic and democratic movement, and expressed the hope that young students would intensify their studies, cultivate themselves, and prepare to participate in the construction of the new China in the future. The audience erupted in thunderous applause. The conference passed a resolution to organize the Hangzhou Student Union, organize propaganda teams to carry out propaganda activities, and prepare to hold a grand parade to celebrate liberation. The conference resolved to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
	More than ten thousand young students and workers gathered in Taiyuan. At the meeting, Lai Ruoyu, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission and Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, elaborated on the Communist Party's policy of caring for young people and uniting and transforming intellectuals. Representatives from many units denounced the crimes of Yan Xishan's bandit gang in murdering young people.
	In Tangshan, 13,000 young people gathered to celebrate May Fourth, and held bonfires and various recreational activities.

    杭州太原青年庆祝五四
    【新华社北平八日电】杭州、太原等新解放大城市的青年兴高彩烈地纪念“五四”节。杭州是三日解放的，第二天晚上二十一个大中学校的四千多学生就在浙江大学广场上举行盛大集会。会场上遍贴“庆祝杭州解放、”“欢迎人民解放军”的标语，台上挂着学生们在二十天以前就秘密地绘好了的毛主席的巨幅画像。到处洋溢着新歌的歌声：“人民的队伍来了，浩浩荡荡，饮马长江！”学生们在开会前，分别自由活动，有的在扭秧歌，有的朗诵着庆祝解放的诗歌。当与记者交谈时，许多人都不禁回忆起在国民党统治下所遭受的迫害。他们说，去年“五四”，正受着“禁止集会”的威胁，许多同学在那几天“失踪”了，浙大学生开纪念会时，不能不在大门口站上岗哨，防止特务袭扰。今天他们却可以自由地庆祝自由的节日了。大会进行中，解放杭州的解放军某部赵政委被邀讲话，他特别赞扬杭州学生在爱国民主运动中向国民党反动派所作的英勇斗争，希望青年同学加紧学习，培养自己，准备参加今后的新中国的建设事业。台下掀起雷动的掌声。大会通过决议，筹组杭州学生联合会，组织宣传队进行宣传活动，并准备举行庆祝解放的大游行。大会决议通电向毛主席、朱总司令致敬。
    太原有万余青年学生和工人集会，会中军管会副主任兼中共太原市委书记赖若愚阐述了共产党爱护青年的团结与改造知识分子的政策。许多单位的代表纷纷控诉了阎锡山匪帮虐杀青年的罪行。
    唐山有一万三千青年集会欢庆“五四”，并举行了营火和各种游艺。
