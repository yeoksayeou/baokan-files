    Review and Prospect
    Yu Pingbo
    "Thirty years make a generation." From 1919 to the present, the time is not short, but we who live in Beijing feel that the people are safe and sound, and the city walls remain the same. Thinking back, it feels like yesterday. Every time "May Fourth" comes around, the students of Peking University always ask me to write some commemorative words, but I often decline and postpone it because, although I participated a little in the May Fourth Movement, I was just a small pawn in the vanguard, and I really don't deserve to talk about this glorious story. Besides, the past is past, so what is there to say?

    This year is different. It's greatly different. Not only is thirty years a generation worth commemorating, but the great era has indeed arrived. The small pawn in the vanguard is still a small pawn in the vanguard, or even smaller, but being close to the edge of this great era seems to be very glorious. As the old saying goes, "sharing in the glory," the spirit of "May Fourth" is also being carried forward and amplified in the sudden and magnificent revolution. This is the most memorable and thought-provoking time since 1919. Although I don't understand much, I have to say a little about what I think.

    The May Fourth Movement of 1919, this youth student movement, on the surface, was political because it used direct action to combat the bureaucratic warlords of the Northern Government in protest against the humiliating diplomacy. However, its roots were very broad, including social and family reform, cultural renewal, ideological liberation, etc. It can be said to be all-encompassing, but it only made a political eruption at the forefront. Therefore, after this movement occurred in Beijing, it immediately swept the country and unfolded a fiery array. In the thirty years before the national liberation this year, there were few such great and moving scenes, even the success of the Northern Expedition in 1928 was a little short.

    To say another sentence, these two epoch-making transformations are really just an extension and elaboration of one thing, and can be regarded as a play. This is a bit like writing an article on a tacked-on topic, but that's really what I think. For example, communist ideas had already sprouted at that time. Mr. Li Dazhao was not only a fighter of the "May Fourth" Movement, but also a pioneer and martyr of communism. Mr. Lu Xun's "Call to Arms" was also mostly written at that time. Isn't science and democracy still that science and democracy? From the perspective of ideological outline, New Democracy and even Communism are not very different from what was advocated by the "May Fourth" Movement thirty years ago. The most important thing is its implementation. Although the momentum of the "May Fourth" Movement was vigorous at that time, internal ideological divisions arose soon after, and external reactionary forces oppressed it. These people wanted to do it, wanted to do it, and prepared to do it, but they never really did it seriously (of course, they had already done part of it in a certain sense). Now, the comrades of the CCP have accomplished it with arduous and extraordinary efforts. The greatness of this great era lies in its implementation. The correctness of ideological leadership is of course fundamental, needless to say. It's like opening a check on May 4, 1919. At that time, it looked like a bad check, but it was cashed today, thirty years later. For someone like me, who has lived in Beijing for about half a lifetime and hasn't moved, waiting for the arrival of light, it naturally seems like a miracle.

    But I believe that the fundamental spirit of "May Fourth" and even the slogans and banners were all very correct, at least at that time. For example, isn't "eliminate national traitors internally" "anti-feudalism" and "punish war criminals"? For example, isn't "resist foreign powers externally" "down with imperialism"? However, there was a layer, and we lost our way several times in these thirty years. Especially in the universities of this ancient city, although we commemorated "May Fourth" every year, it was very much like bureaucratic formalities. Some friends gradually cooled down their enthusiasm at that time, and to be honest, I couldn't help but do so as well. Sometimes, we couldn't even commemorate it publicly and enthusiastically. The newly arrived students must feel happy and nostalgic about this festival as well, but since they have not experienced it personally, it is inevitable that they will not feel very close to it. To tell you the truth, the activities of the students in various schools in recent years to resist strong forces and fight for the light have surpassed the achievements of "May Fourth." It's just that the May Fourth of 1919 was right at the key turning point of the era. The spirit of Peking University is only one, why "May Fourth," and why not "May Fourth."

    Although the old road was lost, we suddenly found it again, and there is a new development in the prospect. How can we express our feelings of surprise and shame? We should always walk well. There is only the question of "start walking." The future of the revolution is still difficult and far away. As the saying goes, "Distance tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart." Because it is difficult, because it is far away, that is even more interesting. What is most gratifying is that the light is ahead, and we are not afraid of getting lost again from now on.

    回顾与前瞻
    俞平伯
    “三十年为一世”，从民八五四到现在，时间不为不久，但我们住在北京的人觉得人民无恙，城郭依然，回想起来仿佛如同昨日。每逢“五四”，北京大学的同学们总来要我写点纪念文字，但我往往推托着，延宕着不写，因为我虽曾参加了一点儿的五四，却不过一名马前小卒，实在不配谈这光荣的故事。况且过去的已过去了，又有什么可说的呢。
    今年却不然了。大大的不同了，非但三十年为一世值得纪念，大时代的确已到了。马前小卒还是马前小卒，或者更小了一些，但挨着这大时代的边缘，仿佛亦很有光彩的，老话所谓“与有荣焉”，这“五四”的精神也在突变的，雄伟无前的革命中发扬光大起来。这是从民八以来最可纪念，最促人反省的一回。我虽不懂什么，也不得不就想到的说一点儿。
    民国八年的五月四日，这个青年学生的运动，从表面上看，因为抗争辱国的外交以直接行动打击北府的官僚们，是政治性的，但它的根底却非常广泛，是社会家庭的改革，文化的鼎新，思想的解放等，……简直可以说包罗万象，不过在尖端上作一个政治性的爆发而已。所以这个运动发生在北京以后，立刻风靡全国，展开了如火如荼的阵容，在今年全国大解放以前，这三十年中很少有过这种伟大令人感动的场面，就是民十七的北伐成功，也还差一点。
    再说一句，这两个划时代的转变，实只是一桩事情的延长引申，不妨当作一本戏看。这很有点象做截搭题的文章，但我的确如此想的。例如共产思想已在那时萌芽，李守常先生一面作“五四”的斗士，一面又是共产主义的先觉和殉道者。鲁迅先生的“呐喊”也大部分在那时候写的。科学和民主可不是还是那科学和民主？就思想的轮廓上看，新民主主义以至于共产主义，和三十年前的“五四”那时所倡导的没有很大的不同，最重要的在它的实行。“五四”当时气势虽然蓬勃，但不久内部在思想上起了分化作用，外面又遭逢反动残余势力的压迫，这些人们虽然想做，要做，预备做，却一直没有认真干，（当然在某一意义上亦已做了一部分）现在被中共同志们坚苦卓绝地给做成了。这大时代之所以大，大在它的实行上，思想领导的正确性当然是根本的，不待言。好比在民国八年五月四日开了一张支票，当时看来很象空头支票，却在三十年后的今天给兑了现，象我在北京约略住了半辈子不曾移动的人，坐着等光明的到来，自然很象奇迹。
    但我信“五四”的根本精神以至口号标语等原都很正确的，至少在那时候是这样。如“内除国贼”不就是“反封建”“惩办战犯”吗？如“外抗强权”不就是“打倒帝国主义”吗？可有一层，这三十年中却几度迷了路途。尤其在这古城的大学里，虽亦年年纪念“五四”，但很象官样文章，有些朋友逐渐冷却了当时的热情，老实说，我也不免如此。甚于有时候并不能公开热烈地纪念它。新来的同学们对这佳节，想一例感到欣悦和怀慕罢，但既不曾身历其境，总不太亲切，亦是难免的。再说句老实话，近年来各校同学们这些反抗强力，争取光明的活动，已迈过了“五四”的成绩还甚，只是民八的五月正当时代转捩的关键而已。北大的精神只有一个，何必“五四”，又何必不是“五四”。
    旧路虽迷，忽然找着了，前景更有新开展，惊喜惭愧的心情如何可言，我们总应当好好的走着罢。也正剩得这“开步走”的问题。革命的前途，犹艰难而遥远。俗语不说吗，“路遥知马力，日久见人心”惟其艰难，惟其遥远，那才更有意思哩。最所欣幸的，光明在前，咱们从今不怕再迷失路途了。
