    Everyone Save Electricity
    Develop Industrial Production
    "Ji Dian" Beiping Branch Proposes Suggestions

    [This newspaper] The Ji Bei (Hebei) Electricity Company, Beiping Branch, suggests that all government offices, schools, factories, and electricity users should save electricity and strengthen industrial production in the future in order to save electricity and develop industrial production. According to the current electricity consumption situation, it is estimated that a part of the electricity can be saved. Some government offices, staff dormitories, student dormitories, hotels, and apartments have a lot of wasted electricity. Shops and vendors also spare no expense in using many electric lights and large candle-powered light bulbs to attract customers due to commercial competition, resulting in a lot of wasted electricity. This phenomenon urgently needs to be improved, otherwise it will affect the use of electricity in industrial production. Therefore, the branch company has formulated measures to save electricity and suggests that all electricity users adopt them. (1) Shops: one door lamp per door, no more than two signboard lamps per business, one display window lamp per window, one business room lamp per room, and all electric lights for advertising purposes should be stopped. One display cabinet lamp per cabinet, one long cabinet lamp per compartment, and one desk lamp per desk. (2) Night stalls: one lamp per stall, and turn off some of the lights as much as possible when there are no customers trading. (3) Government offices, libraries, etc., should reduce the number of electric lights as much as possible. Electric lights that are not related to work should be cancelled. Adjust the height of the lamp holders, reduce the wattage of each light bulb, try not to use hanging lamps, and reduce the use of electric fans. Except for elevators used by hospitals to pick up and drop off patients, the rest are prohibited from using elevators. (4) Staff dormitories, residences, guest houses, student dormitories, private residences, hotels, apartments, etc. of government organizations and factories should install one lamp per room. In addition to reducing the wattage of light bulbs as much as possible and turning off the lights as you go, be sure to turn off the lights before going to bed. (5) Factories, workshops, etc. should adjust the height of the lamp holders to suit the needs of workers in their operations. Adjust the working methods to minimize the idling of motors. When the machine tool stops working, the motor switch should be turned off at any time. (6) The street lights in and outside the city, public markets and parks should be readjusted for their opening and closing times according to the principle of economy to avoid waste. (7) The size of light bulbs used in the various occasions mentioned above, except for fine operations and special purposes (such as repairing watches, laboratories, sewing, medical operating tables, etc.), should be installed with 60 watts or less as much as possible. Neon lights and electric stoves for household use are strictly prohibited. However, neon lights for festive occasions and electric stoves for hospitals and other operations are exceptions. In order to effectively achieve the above-mentioned purpose of saving electricity, the branch company also suggests that the street governments cooperate to convene street residents' meetings to publicize the positive significance of saving electricity. Government offices and factories should mobilize employees to consciously save electricity. (Bai Qing)

    [This newspaper] Since the Ji Bei (Hebei) Electricity Company, Beiping Branch, proposed the suggestion of saving electricity, it first formulated regulations on saving electricity in the company according to the specific situation of the headquarters. It also formulated three measures for rewarding and punishing electricity saving: (1) Those who can save electricity in various offices will be commended, and those who waste electricity will be criticized or punished if necessary. (2) If any employee intentionally wastes electricity, they will be advised once, their name will be announced the second time, and they will be punished the third time. (3) If the office uses too much electricity, the person in charge may be asked to pay attention. (4) If the employee dormitory uses too much electricity, all the employees living in the dormitory should be notified for the first time, and the excess electricity bill should be shared and paid by all for the second time. (5) The total service section shall count and announce the monthly electricity consumption of each section. (Bai Qing)

    发展工业生产
    “冀电”北平分公司提出建议
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司为节约电力，发展工业生产建议各机关、学校、工厂及各用电户今后要节省用电，加强工业生产。根据目前用电情况，估计可以节约一部分电力的。有些机关办公室、职工宿舍、学生宿舍、旅馆、公寓、多有浪费电力的现象。商店、摊贩也因商业上的竞争，不惜用很多电灯及大烛光的灯泡来吸引主顾，以致浪费电力很多。这种现象急须改进，否则会影响到工业生产上的电力使用。因此该分公司拟出节省用电的办法，建议各用电户采纳。（一）商店：门灯每门一盏，字号灯每商号不超过两盏，陈列窗每窗一盏，营业房每间一盏，一切广告用途的电灯一律停止使用。陈列柜每柜一盏，长柜每格一盏，帐桌每桌一盏。（二）夜摊：每摊一盏，在没有主顾交易的时候，尽量关闭部分电灯。（三）机关团体之办公室图书馆等，尽量减少电灯数目。与工作无关之电灯应取消。要调整灯头的高度，减低每个灯泡的瓦数，尽量不用挂灯，减低电扇的使用。除医院接送病号所用电梯外，其余禁止使用电梯。（四）机关团体工厂之职工宿舍、住宅、招待所及学生宿舍、私人住宅、旅馆、公寓等处，每室装灯一盏。除尽量减低灯泡瓦数及随手关闭灯外，睡前一定熄灯。（五）工厂、作坊等要调整灯头的高度，使其适合工作者在作业上的需要。调整工作方法，尽量使电动机不空转。工作机停止工作时，应随时拉开电动机的电闸。（六）城内外及公共市场公园之路灯，应以节约原则重新调整其开闭时间，避免浪费。（七）以上所述各种场合使用灯泡之大小，除精细作业、特别用途（如修理钟表、试验室、缝纫、医疗手术台等）外，尽量按装六十瓦或六十瓦以下者为好。霓红灯及家庭所用之电炉电灶一律禁止使用。但喜庆事用霓虹灯、医院及其他作业使用电炉者例外。为切实达到上述节约用电的目的，该分公司并建议由各街政府配合召集各街市民会议，宣传节约用电的积极意义。机关团体工厂，应发动职工自觉的节省用电。（柏青）
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司自提出节约用电之建议后，首先在该公司根据本部具体情况制定了节约用电条例。又制定了节约用电奖惩办法三项：（一）各办公处所能节省用电者予以表扬，浪费者予以批评或必要处罚。（二）所有职工如有故意浪费用电情形时，一次劝告，二次宣布姓名，三次处罚。（三）办公处所有用电过多情事时，得提请其主管人注意。（四）职工宿舍如用电过多时，第一次应提请全体住宿舍职工注意，第二次，其超过规定度数之电费应由全体分摊付费。（五）各部分每月用电度数由总务课予以统计和公布。（柏青）
