Promote the Use of Coal as Fuel
    Save Firewood for More Manure
    Shijiazhuang Farmers' Service Center Provides Low-Priced Coal

    [This newspaper reported] The Shijiazhuang Farmers' Service Center's coal business is booming, selling an average of 30 tons per day. According to Director Wang of the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the coal sold by the center is generally 8 jiao to 1 yuan cheaper than the retail market price, so farmers from various places (including Xingtai and Wangdu) come here to buy it. This is of great significance in changing the farmers' habit of only using plant fuels. Because in the past coal was expensive or difficult to transport, farmers in central Hebei planted many tall-stalk crops or burned wheat straw and hay that could be used to make fertilizer, resulting in reduced crop yields. In order to make coal widely used by farmers in central Hebei and increase agricultural production, the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to establish business relations with the county federations of nearby counties.

    提倡用煤作燃料
    省下柴草多沤粪
    石市农民服务所低价供煤
    【本报讯】石市农民服务所之煤栈生意兴隆，平均每日出售三十吨。据石市供销总社王主任谈：该所出售的煤，一般比零售市价便宜八角至一元，故各地农民（包括邢台、望都）纷纷来此购买。这对改变农民光用植物燃料的习惯上是具有很大意义的：因为过去煤贵或运输困难，冀中一带农民多种高秆庄稼，或把可沤肥料的麦秸、干草烧掉，致其农作物收成减低。为使冀中农民普遍用煤，以增加农业生产，石市供销总社拟与附近各县县联社建立业务关系。
