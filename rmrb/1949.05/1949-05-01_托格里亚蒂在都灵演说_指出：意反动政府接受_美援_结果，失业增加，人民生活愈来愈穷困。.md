Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: TASS, Rome: Togliatti recently delivered a lengthy speech in Turin, analyzing the Italian economic situation one year after the Christian Democratic government of Gasperi came to power. He pointed out that despite the loudly touted "aid" of the so-called Marshall Plan, Italy's industrial production has still not exceeded the 1938 level, and according to the most daring estimates, it is still 15 percent lower than the aforementioned level. The unemployment situation is particularly alarming. In the year from January 1948 to January 1949, the number of unemployed in Italy increased by 39 percent, reaching 2.16 million at the beginning of 1949. The people are becoming increasingly impoverished.

    指出：意反动政府接受“美援”结果，失业增加，人民生活愈来愈穷困。
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社罗马讯：托格里亚蒂最近在都灵发表长篇演说，分析加斯贝利的基督教民主党政府执政一年后的意大利经济局势。他指出：尽管有大吹大擂的所谓马歇尔计划的“援助”，意大利的工业生产仍未超过一九三八年水平，据最大胆的估计仍较上述水平低百分之十五。失业的情况尤其惊人。在自一九四八年一月至一九四九年一月的一年中，意大利的失业人数增加了百分之三十九，在一九四九年初高达二百一十六万。人民是愈来愈穷困了。
