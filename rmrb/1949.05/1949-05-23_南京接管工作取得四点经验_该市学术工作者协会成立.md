Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: The Nanjing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army Political Takeover Committee is smoothly carrying out the takeover work. As of now, the subordinate Administrative and Judicial Department has successively taken over the Kuomintang government's Audit Department, Ministry of Interior, Executive Yuan, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Examination Yuan, Examination Department, Local Court, Civil Affairs Bureau, and Mausoleum Administration Office; the Public Utilities Department has taken over all the official automobile companies and waterworks, and most of the power plants; the Health Department has mostly completed the takeover of twenty units, including Army Hospitals No. 2, 14, 27, 100, 105, 205, 213, and 220; the Social Affairs Department has taken over all four sections and six offices of the Kuomintang government's Social Affairs Bureau. This takeover work is basically carried out according to the principles of maintaining the original structure and following the respective systems. The departments responsible for the takeover have gained the following preliminary experiences in this phase of work: (1) It is necessary to have a considerable understanding of the units to be taken over in advance, so as to carry out the takeover according to the degree of importance and urgency, and to allocate forces with emphasis, so as to avoid the loss of important materials due to untimely takeover. For example, first take over power plants and other departments with important materials, and then take over general administrative organs. (2) The top-down administrative takeover method should be coordinated with the bottom-up mobilization of the masses to help with the takeover and inventory of materials. Military representatives should understand the situation through progressive elements and working masses in the units to be taken over, and use the method of actively publicizing the Party's policies to educate and organize the masses to assist in the takeover. (3) Employees of the Kuomintang government agencies have always had difficult lives and fear unemployment. In the takeover, it is necessary to hold symposiums and patiently explain to them the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, pointing out that except for a few counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes, ordinary employees, as long as they are willing to serve the people in the future, the People's Government will employ them according to their abilities, so that they can assist in the takeover with peace of mind. (4) At the beginning of the takeover, it is necessary to maintain close contact between superiors and subordinates, and hold a report meeting every other day, so as to discover problems, solve problems, revise the takeover plan and redeploy cadre forces in a timely manner. Problems that cannot be solved by the takeover departments and takeover personnel should be reported to the higher authorities at any time, so as to be solved quickly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: The Nanjing City Academic Workers Association was established on the 17th of this month. Participants in the association include scholars from more than 20 units such as the former Academia Sinica, Central Geological Survey Institute, Mineral Measurement Office, Central Library, and Central Agricultural Experiment Station. At the inaugural meeting, the association announced its purpose as: "To contribute the academic achievements that previously served a few people to the people. To strengthen the unity of the academic community and correctly improve academic research work, to strive for the unity of theory and practice with a scientific, objective, realistic and truth-seeking attitude, and to closely cooperate with social construction work." The association elected Xu Jie, Xie Jiarong and other fifteen people as directors, and Tao Menghe, Yin Zanbei and others as supervisors.

　　南京接管工作取得四点经验
  　该市学术工作者协会成立
    【新华社南京二十一日电】人民解放军南京市军事管制委员会政务接管委员会顺利进行接管工作。截至目前止，所属行政司法部已先后接管了国民党政府的审计部、内政部、行政院、侨务委员会、考试院、考选部、地方法院、市民政局、陵园管理处；公用事业部已将官办的汽车公司、自来水厂全部接管，发电厂大部分接管；卫生部已将军医院第二、十四、二十七、一○○、一○五、二○五、二一三、二二○院等二十个单位大部接管完毕；社会事业部已将国民党政府社会局四科六室全部接管。此次接管工作基本上是按照原封不动、各按系统的原则进行。负责接管各部在这一阶段的工作中得到如下几点初步经验：（一）事先对被接管单位须有相当了解，以便分别轻重缓急进行接管，有重点地配备力量，以免重要物资因未及时接管受到损失。如先行接管水电厂及其他有重要物资的部门，然后再接管一般行政机关。（二）从上而下的行政接管方式要与从下而上的发动群众帮助接管与清查物资相配合。军事代表要通过各该被接管单位中的进步分子和劳动群众来了解情况，并且要用积极地宣传党的政策的办法来教育和组织群众协助接管。（三）国民党政府各机关员工一向生活困难，害怕失业。在接管中，必须召开座谈会，耐心地向他们说明中国共产党和人民解放军的各项政策，指出除了少数罪大恶极的反革命分子外，一般员工只要今后愿意为人民服务，人民政府当量才录用，使其安心协助接管。（四）开始接管时必须密切上下级的联系，应隔日举行汇报一次，以便及时发现问题、解决问题、修正接管计划及重新布署干部力量。各接管部门和接管人员不能解决的问题，应随时向上级请示，以便迅速得到解决。
    【新华社南京二十一日电】南京市学术工作者协会已于本月十七日成立。参加该会的有前中央研究院，中央地质调查所，矿产测验处，中央图书馆及中央农业实验所等二十多单位的学者。该会在成立大会上宣布其宗旨为：“将过去为少数人服务的学术贡献给人民。加强学术界的团结与正确的改善学术研究工作，以科学的客观的实事求是的态度力求理论与实践的统一，紧密的配合社会建设工作。”该会选出许杰、谢家荣等十五人为理事，陶孟和、尹赞北等人为监事。
