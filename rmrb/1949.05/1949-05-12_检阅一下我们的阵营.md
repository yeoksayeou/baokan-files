    Reviewing Our Ranks
    Zhang Wenqi
    As the People's Liberation Army valiantly crosses the Yangtze River and continues to achieve great victories, we, with excitement and joy, welcome and celebrate this year's Nurses' Day in Beiping, a city liberated not long ago. This is an unprecedented grand occasion.
    As everyone knows, China's science has long remained in a backward state, a result of the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The victory of the People's Liberation War not only liberated the Chinese people but also enabled Chinese science to turn itself around from backwardness. Therefore, this year's "May 12th" is a day worth commemorating for all nurses.
    On this deeply commemorative day, it is absolutely necessary for all nurses to seriously review our ranks.
    In our ranks of nurses, there still exists a phenomenon of insufficient cooperation. Some say that the nurses from the old liberated areas are "not qualified," and therefore adopt an attitude of contempt and exclusion towards them. Yes, the nurses in the old liberated areas generally have lower levels of education and poorer technical skills, but they have shed blood and sweat and been utterly loyal during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, which is beyond the reach of "qualified" nurses. When soldiers gloriously wounded for the revolution and the working masses in vast areas longed for someone to heal the wounded and rescue the dying, how many "qualified" nurses met this demand? However, the "unqualified" nurses completed this task first. Of course, we should also value the nurses trained in the cities, who have higher theoretical standards and nursing techniques. Therefore, nurses from both the new and old liberated areas have their own strengths and weaknesses and should learn from each other's strengths to overcome their weaknesses. Only in this way can they cooperate well and make progress together. It is inappropriate for either side to adopt an attitude of contempt and exclusion.
    In our ranks of nurses, there is also a phenomenon of "setting up separate camps," saying that I am of this faction, you are of that faction, I am "orthodox," and you are "non-orthodox." As a result, the camps are opposed to each other and are not united. When talking about oneself, everything is good, but when talking about the other party, nothing is good. We should recognize that so-called good and bad are not absolute but relative. However, under the circumstances of factionalism, people are often unwilling to recognize this truth and are quick to elevate themselves and suppress the other party. Even if some artificial manipulations are added, over time, it will become an unfillable chasm. This will inevitably lead to mutual discrimination, mutual misunderstanding, weakening of each other's strength, and hindering of common development, which is extremely inappropriate.
    In our ranks, there is also a phenomenon of freedom and looseness, with each person sweeping the snow in front of their own door and not caring about the frost on others' roofs, sitting at home behind closed doors, and not asking for help unless necessary, locking oneself in a narrow circle, thinking that being uninvolved in anything is being a great person. We should recognize that this is tantamount to blocking our ears, covering our eyes, and turning ourselves into deaf and blind people. How can we talk about exchanging knowledge and making progress together? This phenomenon should be corrected and must be corrected.
    In short, our ranks are not solid enough and not unified enough, and therefore lack fresh vitality and magnificent strength. We must unite and work hard to help each other. Only in this way can we have strength and progress. To achieve this goal, we must establish and improve our new ranks. We hope that this year's Nurses' Day will be the beginning of establishing our new ranks, allowing it to grow, develop, and flourish, so that by this time next year, it will become a strong and powerful force, working hard to heal the wounded and rescue the dying and promote revolutionary humanitarianism.
    The People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories. I celebrate the victory of this year's Nurses' Day as I celebrate the victory of the People's Liberation Army.

### 检阅一下我们的阵营

    检阅一下我们的阵营
    张文奇
    当人民解放大军英勇越渡长江，继续不断取得伟大胜利的时候，我们以兴奋愉快的心情，在解放未久的北平，迎接与欢度今年的护士节，这是从来未有的盛举。
    众所周知，我国科学长期停留在落后状态，这是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义重重压迫的结果，人民解放战争的胜利，不仅使中国人民翻了身，而且也能使中国科学从落后中翻一个身，因此，今年的“五、一二”是值得全体护士纪念的一日。
    值此深值纪念的一日，全体护士应该认真检阅一下我们的阵营，乃是完全必要的。
    在我们的护士阵营中还存在着不够合作的现象，说什么老解放区的护士“不够格”，因而对之采取了轻视排斥的态度，是的，老解放区护士一般文化较低，技术能力较差，但是他（她）们在八年抗日战争中、人民解放战争中，流尽血汗，忠心耿耿则非“够格”的护士所能及，当为了革命而光荣负伤的战士及广大地区的劳苦大众，渴望有人去救死扶伤的时候，有多少“够格”护士满足了这个要求呢？而“不够格”的护士们却首先完成了这一件事，自然城市培养的护士们，他们有着较高级的理论水准和护病技术，我们也应该重视。所以，无论新老解放区的护士各有所长，各有所短，应该互相裁长补短，这样才能很好合作，共同进步，任何一方采取轻视、排斥的态度，都是不应该的。
    在我们的护士阵营中，还存在着“各立门户”的现象，说什么我是这一派，你是那一派，我是“正统”你是“非正统”，因而门户对立，互不团结，谈自己总是无一不好，谈对方总是无一不坏。我们应当认为：所谓好坏，不是绝对的，而是比较的相对的，但在门户之见的情况下，则往往不肯认识这个真理，而以抬高自己压服对方而后快，甚致如果加上一些人为的制做，日久相传，便成为一条填补不平的鸿沟，这样必然互相歧视，互不谅解，削弱彼此力量，障碍共同发展，是极不应该的。
    在我们的阵营中，还存在着自由散漫的现象，各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜，闭门家中坐，无事不求人，把自己关闭在狭小的圈子里，认为与事无争，便是大大好人。我们应该认为：这等于堵塞自己的耳朵，蒙上自己的眼睛，把自己变成一个聋子瞎子一样，这样如何谈到交换知识，互相进步，此种现象是应该改正而又必需改正的。
    总之我们的阵营是不够坚固，不够一致的，因此也就缺乏新鲜活泼、雄伟壮大的力量，我们必须团结，努力互助。只有这样才能有力量，才能有进步，为了达到这个目的，必须建立与健全我们新的阵营，希望今年的护士节，便是建立我们新阵营的开始，让它滋长发展，欣欣向荣，明年的今日成为一支坚强有力的力量，为救死扶伤，发扬革命的人道主义而努力。
    人民解放大军已取得了伟大的胜利，我庆祝今年护士节的胜利，象庆祝人民解放大军的胜利一样。
