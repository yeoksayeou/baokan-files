　　The Rebirth of Industry and Commerce in Tianjin and Beiping
　　Zhang Naiqi
　　The New Democratic economic policy program is to "develop production, promote economic prosperity, consider both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." This program has not only been unanimously and enthusiastically supported by people from all strata and aspects but has also demonstrated brilliant achievements in its implementation.

　　As the revolutionary war nears its final victory, major and medium-sized cities are successively liberated. The CPC Central Committee, grasping this new situation, decided on a new policy of taking cities as the center of work to lead the countryside while simultaneously emphasizing the countryside. These major and medium-sized cities, economically, were originally centers of the countryside, and on the other hand, were mostly entrepots for international trade. Therefore, Chairman Mao added "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges" to "considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," developing it into a guiding principle for establishing reasonable relationships in all directions. At this point, the content of the New Democratic economic program is particularly rich.

　　Establishing reasonable relationships in all directions is an arduous task. Taking the liberated Tianjin and Beiping as an example, we can understand that: initially, there will be unavoidable difficulties, and then we can gradually enter a smooth situation. Why are there unavoidable difficulties? Because this is a revolution, especially a New Democratic revolution. Being a revolution, it is inevitable that "correcting a wrong" will "overcorrect." Turning over is not an elegant matter of courteous yielding, but a rough and tumble struggle, and it is hardly possible not to bump into others. The ranks of the New Democratic revolution are also so broad, including so many strata. Among them, some people have not yet realized whether they are revolutionaries or those being revolutionized. When a friend hides himself in the enemy's nest, can you talk to him about friendship? Even if he hides in an unknowable place, it is not easy for you to find him!

　　From an economic perspective, these unavoidable difficulties are manifested in ideology, capital, production efficiency, management efficiency... all of which must go through a lean period.

　　The ideologically lean period refers to the fact that it is not easy for the two sides or one side in each aspect to communicate with each other for a while. This situation is most significant in the relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie. After the workers turned over, they had been subjected to all kinds of oppression in the past, and they would inevitably want to find an object to vent their grievances. However, in the city, economically, the object of revolution is relatively indirect and unclear. Unlike in the countryside, where peasants face landlords directly. The political enemy—the Kuomintang reactionary regime—has been overthrown, but economically, there are national capitalists who are like enemies but not enemies. "Enemies are bound to meet," this sentence is a good portrayal of the labor and capital sides in China today. On the one hand, their interests conflict, but on the other hand, they are interdependent. During the Kuomintang rule, in order to carry out revolutionary tasks, labor often had to oppose the capitalists in order to oppose the Kuomintang, and the capitalists often used political power to suppress labor to a greater or lesser extent. Naturally, they have already become enemies. It is inevitable that there will be an ideologically lean period to transform enemies into friends immediately after liberation, and to work together for the development of production on the basis of mutual benefit. Moreover, even in today's advocacy of mutual benefit, we still cannot deny the fact of class contradiction, nor can we blur class consciousness, which requires very patient explanation and very dialectical understanding.

　　The capitalists' thinking often inherits the Kuomintang's notion that "China only has big poor and small poor," and they do not admit that they are capitalists, and are ashamed to be capitalists, especially ashamed to be exploiters. Management personnel are even unwilling to admit that they represent the capitalists. This statement may have its basis subjectively. Indeed, some industrialists in China do not intend to "pursue profit only" but want to do something. Compared with European and American capitalists, their strength is too small. Take myself as an example, when someone says I am a capitalist, I am a little embarrassed to admit it. I especially understand that in the past, it would have been too foolish for Chinese industrialists to "pursue profit only" and engage in production. In fact, "pursuing profit only" and exploitation are two different things. The former is subjective, while the latter is objective. The result of exploitation can also be unprofitable, because the profits are seized by imperialists, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalists. In addition, some people engaged in production, even if they subjectively do not "pursue profit only," still need to seek profits to meet the requirements of capitalists to make money and share dividends. These business operators who do not "pursue profit only," do not intend to exploit, and do not simply represent the capitalists, are the possible virtues of industrialists in the youth of capitalism, and they are worthy of cherishing. However, if we excessively emphasize these virtues, deny the existence of objective exploitation, and even regard ourselves as benefactors and philanthropists, such thinking will inevitably fall behind the times, and we will not be able to fulfill our mission satisfactorily.

　　Mr. Liu Shaoqi told everyone in Tianjin: In New Democratic China, national capitalists who are engaged in production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are patriotic capitalists, not shameful, but glorious. The Communist Party and the proletariat regard them as one of the revolutionary and construction friends, and as a component of the new regime. Capitalists expanding their factories and production means objectively expanding the scope of capitalist exploitation. Under the current conditions in China, this is not only allowed, but also needed, and it is beneficial to workers, the country, and society, and therefore meritorious. Marx and Communists have never denied the merit of the bourgeoisie in improving social productivity in its youth. He also pointed out: On the one hand, we must admit the fact of the contradiction between labor and capital; on the other hand, we must seek mutual benefit in the contradiction; any party in a disadvantageous position can take necessary and appropriate struggles. This remark gave the distressed capitalists a reassurance and a refreshing medicine. Soon, Mr. Song Feiqing, the head of the East Asia Enterprise Company, responded by expanding production and adding the second ramie weaving factory to respond to this call. The ideologically lean period has obviously passed.

　　In the relationship between public and private, and internal and external, there are also ideologically lean periods. I cannot go into details here. Now let's talk about the capital lean period.

　　After the Kuomintang's various and exhaustive searches, most of the national industry and commerce are impoverished. It is easier to open a store, but it is necessary to raise a batch of funds to resume factory production. Where does the funding come from? Hopes are often pinned on loans from the state bank. Private money shops have no funds to lend in the early days of liberation, and the high interest rates are definitely not affordable for industrial production. What about the state bank? On the one hand, it naturally wants to support production, and on the other hand, it must also take care of the stability of the currency base. In the process of supporting production, investigation and understanding are necessary. This forms a capital lean period.

　　Our monetary base is established on productivity and the abundance of material supply. Therefore, as long as the currency issued can be exchanged for materials needed by the people of equal value, or more valuable materials can be produced shortly after being issued, the state bank and state-owned trading institutions will not be stingy. However, we must also understand that the Communist Party is good at overcoming difficulties. Its requirements for its own cadres are to work hard and rely on their own efforts under unified leadership. Therefore, if you do not first think of a solution yourself, but rely on a dependent mentality and irresponsibly make wild claims to the state bank, you will not get results. Hiding your true situation, opening a flowery account, preparing to let the state bank give a 30% or 20% discount, and the loan you receive can still be diverted to seek illegitimate benefits, this method of dealing with the Kuomintang in the past is absolutely impossible today. Only by sincerely accepting the leadership of the policy, striving for the interests of your own business from the common struggle for the development of the entire national economy, frankly reporting the overall truth, carefully thinking about all the methods, and then putting forward a figure of absolutely indispensable funds, that kind of request is very likely to get full approval. What ways to think of? The most common point is that we can see that there is still potential capital in the society. Many industrialists, in order to help the construction of the new country, have aroused a high degree of enthusiasm for production, and have exhausted their efforts to run around and call for help, first taking out the savings of their parents and wives, and then borrowing gold and silver from relatives and friends, in order to achieve the goal of resuming work and increasing production. Isn't it a good example? As a modern entrepreneur, it is a glorious achievement to be able to mobilize existing human resources and develop natural resources, and it can be said to be an even greater glorious undertaking to be able to mobilize potential capital, and even to attract speculative capital to the road of production. With such public-private, upper and lower cooperation, the capital lean period can be quickly overcome and enter a smooth situation. Tianjin and Beiping have already reached this stage of "the darkest hour is just before the dawn."

　　Speaking of production efficiency, the lean period is even more unavoidable. In the past, the Kuomintang helped the capitalists to oppress the workers, divided the workers, and sometimes even provoked the relationship between labor and capital. Therefore, the general production efficiency was very low. The capitalists paid wages but did not get the due production efficiency, and the workers sold their labor but did not get enough food and clothing. It was a typical example of "labor and capital both losing." More seriously, the triple oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, as well as the double exploitation of inflation and usury, directly fell on the capitalists, and indirectly at least part of it was passed on to the workers. As a result, the capitalists sometimes accused "high wages," while the workers simultaneously shouted "not enough to eat." Are wages too high? From the perspective of the capitalists' burden, it may be right, but from the perspective of the workers' income, it is not necessarily right. For example, wages in Hong Kong were much higher than wages in the mainland at that time, but Hong Kong's industry could still operate, which can prove that the capitalists' main problem was not wages, but politics. Moreover, although wages in Hong Kong are high, the workers' lives are not better than our workers, which can prove that the workers' main problem is also not wages, but the social system.

　　In the cities after liberation, although the CPC and the People's Government do not advocate a high-wage policy, the wages of some industries still have to be increased. Sometimes, due to the spontaneous demands of the workers, going to deviations, the increase in wages may temporarily exceed the limits of the factory's burden. Therefore, the "high wage" problem has become a serious problem again. However, the seriousness of this problem is still temporary. As long as the workers improve labor discipline and increase production efficiency, the seriousness of this problem may pass. In addition, today's industry is absolutely not afraid of the dumping of foreign goods, absolutely no destructive forces of reactionaries, absolutely no extortion by corrupt officials, absolutely no oppression by bureaucratic capital, it can be said to have been completely and fully guaranteed. Not only that, due to the reconstruction of urban-rural relations, due to the increase in the purchasing power of peasants after the land reform, due to the correct leadership of the People's Government in guiding farmers to produce the necessary raw materials, and even more due to the sincere assistance of the People's Government in the supply of raw materials, the sales of products, and the convenience of transportation, the market for production undertakings has expanded, raw materials are abundant, costs have been reduced, turnover has accelerated, and prosperity is inevitable. This example can be fully seen in cities that have been liberated for a long time, and Tianjin and Beiping are gradually being reborn. Not only can the lean period of production efficiency pass quickly, but the entire lean period of management efficiency can also pass quickly.

　　The attitude of the People's Government towards private capital is very clear. That is: speculative capital must be cracked down on, legitimate commercial capital must be protected, and production capital must be vigorously supported. It only needs to grasp one point, that is: private capital must be under the leadership of state capital. For the interests of all the people, in order to avoid anarchic production, in order for the entire economic construction to obtain the highest efficiency, and even to ensure that private capital does not go astray, for the public and for the private, this leadership is necessary. Facts have already proved that this is completely different from the Kuomintang's so-called "leadership" that sacrifices the majority for the sake of the minority and leads the industry to the grave. Industrialists and businessmen should sincerely accept this leadership, for the country, for the people, and also for themselves.

　　Everyone has already admitted that the People's Government's management of Tianjin and Beiping is generally successful. The revolutionary order was quickly established, public utilities were not interrupted, and were quickly improved, production and cultural education undertakings quickly recovered, and the market quickly recovered prosperity, which are all obvious facts. Although the Communist Party members are very humbly admitting everywhere that they are laymen in urban management and outsiders in industry and commerce, the facts have proved that they are doing better than any era. The so-called layman, the so-called outsider, is only a comparative statement relative to rural management and peasant work. However, local mistakes and temporary deviations are inevitable. Regarding this, we industrialists and businessmen must at least bear part of the responsibility. I feel that in the process of implementing urban policies, right-leaning deviations tend to get quick reactions and quick corrections, while left-leaning deviations, the reactions are too slow, and the corrections are not quick enough. What is the reason? The reason is that right-leaning deviations directly harm the workers, and the workers' organizations can quickly raise criticisms; while left-leaning deviations directly harm the industrialists and businessmen, and the industrialists and businessmen are lazy to put forward reasonable proposals. At the beginning of liberation, the industrialists and businessmen were anesthetized by the Kuomintang's counter-propaganda, and they were afraid of "liquidation" and afraid of "struggle" all day long. They dared not lightly believe in the slogan of "mutual benefit between labor and capital," and held a negative and wait-and-see attitude towards the new regime, so naturally they were lazy to put forward proposals. Even after a considerable period of time, they have found that the Kuomintang's counter-propaganda is completely inaccurate, and they still hold a "submissive" negative attitude, and still believe that this is just a change of ruling class, this is just a group of better officials. They are thinking in their hearts: "Since it is a better group, let them manage it!" This is completely insufficient, this is still dereliction of duty to the country! To actively put forward their own opinions and actively participate in the joint management of national affairs, that is worthy of being called the master of the new country.

　　I earnestly hope that the industrialists and businessmen of Tianjin and Beiping can further improve their enthusiasm, and further read the documents of the CPC and the People's Government in detail, so as to gain a deeper understanding. In this way, naturally, they can exert greater enthusiasm for the new country! I even hope that the industrialists and businessmen in the newly liberated cities can accept the lessons of Tianjin and Beiping, believe in every word and every character that the CPC and the People's Government tell us, and earnestly recognize that this is their own regime, and contribute all their strength wholeheartedly! These are the most glorious days of the Chinese nation in history, let each of us fulfill a glorious task!

　　平津工商业的新生
    章乃器
    新民主主义的经济政策纲领，是“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”。这个纲领，不但早已得到各阶层各方面人民的一致热烈拥护，而且在施行上，已经表现了辉煌的成绩。
    由于革命战争接近最后的胜利，大中都市接连的得到解放。中共中央把握住这个新的形势，决定了以都市为工作中心领导农村而同时重视农村的新方针。这些大中都市，在经济上一面本来是农村的中心，另一面却又多为国际贸易的吞吐港。因此，毛主席便在“公私兼顾、劳资两利”之外，加上“城乡互助，内外交流”两项，发展成为四面八方合理关系建立的指导原则。至此，新民主主义经济纲领的内容，是格外的丰富了。
    建立四面八方的合理关系，是一件艰巨的工作。以解放后的平津来看，我们还可以了解到：初期要经过不可避免的困难，随后才能逐渐进入顺境。为什么会有不可避免的困难？就因为这是一个革命，特别是一个新民主主义的革命。是一个革命，“矫枉”就难免“过正”。翻身不是一件雍容揖让的雅事，而是一场粗手粗足的斗争，不碰到别人是不大可能的。新民主主义革命的队伍又是那么阔大，包括那么多的阶层。那中间有些人自己还没有意识到究竟是革命者，还是被革命者。当一位友人自己躲到敌人的窝里去的时候，你能找他谈友情吗？即使他躲到一个不可知的去处，你也不容易招寻他呀！
    从经济一环来说，这种不可避免的困难，表现在思想上，资金上，生产效能上，经管效能上……都要经过一个青黄不接的时期。
    思想上青黄不接的时期，就指四面的每一面当中的双方或者一方的思想一时不容易搞通。这种情形，以工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间的关系为最显著。劳工翻了身，过去受到千般压迫，一口怨气，少不了要找一个对象来发泄一下，可是，在都市里，在经济上，革命的对象是比较的不太直接，不太明朗。不象农村那样，农民对面，便有地主。政治上的敌人--国民党反动政权已经被打倒了，经济上却留下来似敌人而非敌人的民族资本家。“不是冤家不聚头”，这句话真好为今天的中国劳资双方写照。他们一面是利害冲突的，然而，另一面又是互相依存的。在国民党统治时代，劳工为着执行革命任务，往往势须通过反对资方以反对国民党，资方也常或多或少的借重政治的力量，以镇压劳工。相互间很自然的，已经俨然成为敌人。解放后马上要化敌为友，要在两利的基础上为发展生产而共同努力，在思想上，少不了便存在着一个青黄不接的时期。何况，就在主张两利的今天，我们仍然不能否认阶级矛盾的事实，仍然不能模糊阶级意识，这就需要很耐心的去说明，很辨证的去理解了。
    资方的思想，往往还继承着国民党所谓“中国只有大贫小贫”的一套，不承认自己够得称资本家，而且耻为资本家，尤其耻为剥削者。管理人员更不肯承认自己代表了资方。这种说法，在主观上容或有它的根据。中国的产业家的确有一部分人存心并不“唯利是图”；而是想做一番事业的。他们和欧美资本家比起来，力量也真太小。就说自己吧，当有人说我是资本家的时候，我也有点不好意思承认。我尤其明了，在过去，中国工商业家真要“唯利是图”的话做生产事业就太傻了。其实“唯利是图”和剥削是两回事，前者是主观的，而后者是客观的。剥削的结果也可以无利可图，因为利润是被帝国主义者、封建势力和官僚资本家所夺取了。此外，某些做生产事业的人，主观上即使并不“唯利是图”，但是依然需要谋取利润，以满足资本家赚钱分红的要求。这些企业经营家在主观上不“唯利是图”，不存心剥削，不一味的代表资方，乃是资本主义青年时代产业家可能有的美德，是足以珍贵的。但，倘使我们过分的强调了这些美德，否认客观上剥削的存在，甚至以施主、慈善家自居，那种思想，就不免要落在时代之后，也就不能圆满执行自己的时任务了。
    刘少奇先生在天津告诉大家：在新民主主义的中国里，凡属从事于有益国计民生的生产事业的民族资本家，即爱国的资本家，并不是可耻的，而是光荣的，共产党和无产阶级是把他们当作革命的和建设的友人之一，新政权的组成分子之一看待的。资本家扩大自己的工厂生产，即是说在客观上扩大资本主义剥削的范围，这在中国目前的条件之下，不但是允许的，而且是需要的，对于工人，对于国家社会，都是有利的，因而也是有功的。马克思和共产党人从来就不否认资产阶级在青年时代提高社会生产力的这种功绩。他还指出：一面必须承认劳资阶级矛盾这一个事实；一面在矛盾当中必须求得两利；任何处于不利的一方可以采取必要的、适当的斗争。他这一席话，使得苦闷的资方吃了一颗定心丸，服了一剂清凉散。很快的，东亚企业公司的主持人宋斐卿先生就来了一个响应，以扩大生产，添设织麻第二厂来答复这一个号召。思想上青黄不接的时代显然是过去了。
    在公私和内外的关系上，也都存在着思想上青黄不接的时期。我不能在这里加以细说了。现在说一说资金上青黄不接的时期。
    经过国民党五花八门，敲骨吸髓的搜括，大多数的民族工商业是贫困了。商店开门比较还容易，工厂复工却非筹到一批资金不可。资金从何而来？希望就往往寄托在国家银行的贷款，私人银钱业在解放的初期是无款可放的，利息的高昂也决非工业生产所能负担。国家银行呢？它一面自然要扶植生产，另一面还要照顾到货币基础的稳定。在扶植生产的过程当中，少不了还要先多照顾公营事业。“公私兼顾”当然是要先公后私的呀。在扶植私营事业的过程中，调查和了解又是必要的。这就形成一个资金上青黄不接的时期。
    我们的货币基础建立在生产力上面，建立在物资供应的充裕上面。因此，只要货币发出去能换取到同等价值的人民大众所需的物资，或者发出去不久便可以生产出来更多价值的物资，国家银行和公营贸易机构是不会吝啬的。可是，我们同时必须明白，共产党是善于克服困难的，它对于自己干部的要求，便是在统一的领导之下，艰苦奋斗，自力更生。因此，如果自己不先想办法，只凭着一种依赖的心情，不负责任的向国家银行信口开河，那是不会得到结果的。掩蔽了自己的实情，开了一篇花帐，准备让国家银行打一个七折八扣，拿到的贷款依然可以流用，博取非分的利益，这种过去对待国民党的手段，在今天更是绝对做不通。只有诚心诚意接受政策的领导，从共同争取整个国民经济的发展当中争取自己事业的利益，坦率的报告了全盘的实情，细心的想尽了一切的办法，然后再提出一个绝对不可少的资金数字，那种要求到是很可能得到全数的核准的。想什么办法呢？最通常的一点，我们可以看到社会上依然还有潜在的资力。有许多工业家为着帮助新国家的建设，激发了高度的生产热情，舌敝唇焦，奔走呼号，把父母妻子的积蓄先拿出来，再把亲戚朋友的金银借到手，以达到复工增产的目的，难道不是很好的证例吗？作为一个现代的企业家，能够动员现成的人力，开发天然的资源，固然是光荣的功业，能够动员潜在的资力，甚至能够把投机资本吸引到生产的路上去，可以说是更大的光荣事业。如此的公私上下的配合，资金青黄不接的时期，就可以很快的度过，而进入顺境。平津在目前，就已经到达这一个“否极泰来”的阶段。
    说到生产效能，青黄不接的时期更是无可避免的了。国民党在过去，一面帮助资方压迫劳工，一面分化劳工，而且有时还要挑拨劳资两方的关系。因此，一般生产效能是十分低落的。资方付出工资得不到应有的生产效能，劳方出卖劳力得不到温饱，真是一个十足的“劳资两损”的典型。更严重的，还是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的三重压迫，以及通货膨胀和高利贷的两重剥削，直接的落在资方的头上，间接的至少一部分要转嫁到工人的身上。弄得资方有时控诉“高工资”，而劳方同时叫喊“吃不饱”。工资是否太高？从资方的负担来说可能是对的，从劳力的所得来说就未必对。比方，香港的工资就比当时内地工资高得很多，然而香港的工业依然可以经营，这就可以证明资方的主要问题并不在于工资，而在于政治了。还有香港的工资虽高，而工人生活并不比我们的工人好，这又可证明，劳方的主要问题也并不在于工资，而在于社会制度了。
    解放以后的都市，虽然中共和人民政府都不主张高工资政策，但，某些部分的产业，工资还是要增加一些的。有时由于工人的自发要求，走上偏向，工资的增加还可能一时的超过了厂方负担的限度。因此，“高工资”问题又变成一个严重问题了。但，这一个问题的严重性，依然是一时的。只要劳工提高了劳动纪律，增加了生产效能，这个问题的严重性，就可能会过去。此外，今后的工业，绝对不怕外货的倾销，绝对没有反动势力的摧残，绝对没有贪官污吏的勒索，绝对没有官僚资本的压迫，真可说得到了完全的、充分的保障。不仅如此，由于城乡关系的重建，由于土改以后农民购买力的提高，由于人民政府正确的领导农民，生产必需的原料，更由于人民政府对于原料的供应，产品的销售，以至运输的便利，处处诚心的帮助生产事业。生产事业的市场扩大了，原料充沛了，成本减轻了，周转加速了，繁荣是必然的。这种证例，在解放较久的都市里，已经可以完全看到，平津也逐渐的在新生了。岂止生产效能青黄不接的时期迅速的可以过去，整个经营效能青黄不接的时期，也可以迅速的过去。
    人民政府对于私人资本的态度是再明确不过了。那就是：投机资本是要加以打击的，正当商业资本是要给予保护的，生产资本是要大力扶植的。她只要把握住一点，那就是：私人资本必须在国家资本的领导之下。为着全体人民的利益，为着要避免无政府的生产，为着整个经济建设能得到最高的效能，甚至为着保证私人资本不走上错路，为公为私，这种领导都是必要的。事实都已经证明，这和国民党为着少数人，牺牲多数人，使产业走向坟墓的所谓“领导”，是完全不同的两回事。工商业家应该诚心诚意的接受这一个领导，为了国家，为了人民，也是为了自己。
    大家都已经承认：人民政府对于平津的管理，大体上是成功的。革命的秩序迅速的建立起来，公用事业不曾停顿，而且很快的得到了改善，生产和文化教育事业，很快的恢复起来，市面很快的恢复繁荣，这都是有目共睹的事实。尽管共产党员到处很谦虚的自认对于都市管理是外行，对于工商业是门外汉，事实已经证明，他们比任何时代都做得好。所谓外行，所谓门外汉，只是相对于农村管理和农民工作的比较说法而已。然而，局部的错误和一时的偏向，是不可免的。关于这，我们工商业家至少也要负一部分的责任。我感觉到，在都市政策的执行过程当中，过右的偏向往往会得着很快的反应和很快的纠正，而过左的偏向，反应就太迟钝，纠正也就不够迅速。原因何在？就在于过右的偏向直接受害的是工人，工人的组织能够很快的提出批评；而过左的偏向，直接受害的是工商业家，工商业家怠于提出合理的主张。工商业家在解放的初期，受到了国民党反宣传的麻醉，成日害怕“清算”害怕“斗争”，对于“劳资两利”的口号不敢轻信，对于新政权怀着消极观望的态度，自然就怠于提出主张了。甚至过了相当时期，已经发觉国民党反宣传的完全不确，依然抱着“顺民式”的消极态度，仍然认为这不过是统治阶级的换班，这不过是一群较好的官儿。他们心里在想：“既然是较好的一群，就让他们管吧！”这是完全不够的，这依然是对于国家的怠工！要积极提出自己的意见，积极的来共同管理国家的事情，那才酣称新国家的主人。
    我殷切的希望平津的工商业家能够更进一步的提高积极性，更进一步的去细读中共和人民政府的文献，求得更深的了解，如此，自然而然的，便可对新国家发挥更大的热情！我更希望新解放都市里的工商业家，能够接受平津的教训，相信中共和人民政府所告诉我们的每一句话和每一个字，切切实实的认定这是自己的政权，尽心竭力的贡献自己全部的力量！这是历史上中华民族最光荣的日子，让我们每一个人都能尽一份光荣的任务！
