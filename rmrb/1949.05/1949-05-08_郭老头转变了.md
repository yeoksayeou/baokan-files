    [Shijiazhuang Electric] Workers at the Shijiazhuang Railway Machinery Factory changed the unreasonable old rules for cleaning boilers and democratically established reasonable new rules.
    In the past, the factory had to clean the boiler once a week. According to the old rules, it was done by two people, and four hours of overtime were calculated (regardless of how long it actually took). Recently, clerk Lao Dong and foreman Yan cleaned a boiler and only took two hours. They truthfully reported two hours of overtime. However, boiler operator Guo, an old worker, was very dissatisfied, believing that they were "changing the old rules arbitrarily" and trying to "show off." He raised his concerns at the review meeting. After a debate, worker Lao Hei said, "In the past, two people always reported four hours of overtime, which was wrong. They should report the actual hours they worked." Old Man Guo angrily said, "No! If two people work, they report four hours. If it's two hours, I won't do it. Let whoever can do it!" Staff member Lao Wang said, "Master Guo, don't be angry. Reporting the actual work is correct. If people work two hours and report two hours, it's the right thing to do." Guang Yuan said, "No matter who it is, as long as the boiler is cleaned, they should report the actual time it took. Of course, we should strive to be efficient and not delay." After the meeting, Old Man Guo thought it over and realized something was wrong. Everyone else had the public interest in mind, so why was he so selfish? The next day, at the following meeting, he said to Lao Dong with a self-reflecting tone, "I'm old and have an old way of thinking. Many comrades have spoken to me, and I shouldn't insist on my wrong opinion. Rules aren't set in stone. Today, the factory has become our own business, so we must work honestly." The following Sunday, Guo cleaned the boiler by himself. He went to work early and quickly cleaned the boiler, even cleaning the distilled water filter bucket. He reported four hours of overtime based on his actual working time (according to the old rules, he would have reported eight hours of overtime).

    郭老头转变了
    【石家庄电】石家庄铁路机厂工人，改变了不合理的洗锅炉的老规矩，民主制订合理的新规矩。
    该厂过去每隔一星期要洗一次锅炉，按老规矩是两个人，按四小时加班计算（不论干多少时间都是这样算）。最近洗锅炉的事务员老董和阎领班干了一次，只用了两个钟头，他们实事求是的报了加班两小时；但烧锅炉的郭老工友很不满意，认为他们“随便改老规矩”，是想“露一露脸”，就在检讨会上提出意见。经过争论，工人老黑说：“以前两个人老报四点钟加班，不对，实在干了几点就该报几点。”郭老头气愤地说：“不！两人干得报四点，两点我不干，谁能干叫谁干！”干事老王说：“郭师傅，你不要生气，实干实报是对的，人家干两点报两点，是应该的。”光元说：“不管是谁，把锅炉洗干净，多会干完报多会，当然要往前赶，不能往后拉。”散会后，郭老头越想越不对头，人家都有公心，为什么自己私心这样重呢？第二天接着开会的时候，他带着反省的语调对老董说：“我年岁老了，老脑筋。好多同志都给我讲了，我不该老坚持自己不对的意见。规矩不是老不变的：今天工厂成了自己的家业，总得实实在在地干才对。”下一个星期日，郭只一个人洗锅炉，他很早上班，很快把锅炉洗完，连蒸溜水滤热桶都洗干净了，他按实际工作时间报了四个钟头加班（照以前就要报八点加班）。
