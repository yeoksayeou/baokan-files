　　【Jinan Telegram】Yuanchao Rushes to Plant Peanuts
    Guaranteeing Completion of the Plan
    [Jinan Telegram] After completing cotton planting, farmers in Yuanchao, with the timely resolution of various ideological concerns and difficulties among the masses by village party members and cadres, the entire county has entered a heatwave of digging wells and planting peanuts. In Beilizhuang Village, Second District, under the leadership of the branch, farmers accurately calculated the acreage for peanut planting and the required water volume for the entire village, deeply mobilizing well-digging and planting. They dug four earthen wells in two days. Zhao Defa and his wife from Dongtianzhuang, Seventh District, dug a three-zhang-deep earthen well in one day and one night, producing sixty dan of water daily. Before digging the earthen well, his family only planned to plant three mu of peanuts; now his wife says, "This well produces so much water, let's buy some more peanut seeds and plant another two mu!" Currently, twenty earthen wells have been dug in the entire village, and the masses are enthusiastically planting. According to incomplete statistics from four districts, 824 earthen wells have been dug in two days. The County Committee has recently formed an inspection team, which went to the countryside on the 7th of this month to promote planting, help farmers solve difficulties such as water sources, tools, and labor, and ensure the complete realization of the plan to plant 210,000 mu of peanuts.

　　元朝抢种花生
    保证完成计划
    【冀南电】元朝农民在完成点棉的基础上，各村党员、干部及时解决了群众各种思想顾虑及困难，全县进入掘井点种花生的热潮。二区北李庄农民，在支部领导下，精确计算了全村种花生亩数及所需水量，深入动员掘井点种，两天掘好土井四眼。七区东田庄赵德法和他媳妇，一天一夜掘好了一个三丈深的土井，每天出六十担水，未掘土井前他家只计划种三亩花生，现在他媳妇说：“这井出水这么旺，咱再买点花生种，多种上二亩吧！”现全村已掘好土井二十眼，群众正热烈点种。据四个区不完全统计，两天工夫已掘土井八百二十四眼。该县县委会近又组成检查团，于本月七日下乡推动点种，帮助农民解决水源、工具、劳力等困难，保证种花生二十一万亩的计划彻底实现。
