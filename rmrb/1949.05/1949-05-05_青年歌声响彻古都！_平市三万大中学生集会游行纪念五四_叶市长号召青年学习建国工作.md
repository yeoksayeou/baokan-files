    Youthful Songs Resound Through the Ancient Capital!
    30,000 Middle School and University Students in Ping City Rally and Parade to Commemorate May Fourth
    Mayor Ye Calls on Youth to Study Nation-Building Work
    [This newspaper reports] Various units in the city, including Huabei University, Normal University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and over eighty other universities, middle schools, and youth organizations, held grand commemorations of the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement in their respective districts. Approximately 31,000 middle school and university students, and young workers participated in the commemorations. Each school invited worker representative Comrade Zhao Zhenbang and democratic figures such as Mr. Ma Xulun, Mao Dun, Zhang Zhiran, Professor Fei Qing, and others to attend and speak. Each district held recreational activities to add to the celebratory atmosphere. In the evening, students from each district held bonfire parties and torchlight parades. Melodious songs, majestic military music, songs, applause, and cheers echoed through the streets of the ancient capital of Beiping.
    [This newspaper reports] Over a thousand youth representatives, representing 500,000 young people from all walks of life in Ping City, held a grand May Fourth commemoration meeting at the National Grand Theater last night (the 4th). This was the first time in history that youth representatives freely commemorated their own festival. The conference began at 5:20 PM, and a presidium of seventeen people, including Peng Zhen, Ye Jianying, Shen Junru, and Xu Liqun, was elected. After a speech by Xu Liqun, Chairman of the conference presidium, Mayor Ye Jianying spoke. Mayor Ye recalled the arduous creation of the revolutionary cause, and he encouraged the representatives by saying: The "May Fourth" Movement has a history of thirty years. In these thirty years, after arduous struggle, reactionary forces will now be completely eliminated, and the people's victory has been secured. Many martyrs of the May Fourth era, such as Comrade Li Dazhao, sacrificed themselves. They educated the youth with Marxist-Leninist theory. Now, the youth of the whole country should unite and learn from the spirit of the martyrs. Our pioneers firmly believed in the victory of the people's revolutionary cause and disregarded their own sacrifices, offering their blood and heads to the people, adhering to the truth, and fighting for the people for thirty years. To commemorate May Fourth, we should learn from this spirit and eliminate reactionary forces. Now, the world's counter-revolutionary forces have not been completely defeated, and the world's people have not been completely liberated. We must still use the spirit of armed struggle to grasp political power. After that, we must build steadily, support the war, and carry the revolution through to the end. The youth are in control of the future, learning how to build the country is an arduous task. Intellectual youth must unite with workers and peasants, learn all production knowledge from them, because the world is created by labor. At the same time, we must also study Marxist-Leninist theory, study what the people actually need, and study science and technology, combining knowledge with actual struggle. In actual struggle, we must correct the shortcomings in our learning. Only knowledge that has been tested is useful. We must combine learning with work, learning with struggle, and theory with practice.
    Mr. Shen Junru said in his speech: To commemorate May Fourth, we must punish the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his diehards; we must drive American imperialism out of China.
    Comrade Wu Yuzhang encouraged the youth to inherit the spirit of May Fourth, rise up one after another, and fight against imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces that try every possible means to oppress the Chinese people.
    Then, worker, peasant, and student representatives spoke successively. Worker representative Xu Shirong said that in the past, there was a great distance between workers and intellectuals, which was caused by the old society. Now that society has changed, we should join hands and fight more strongly. Student representative Gu Qicong said that Chairman Mao called on all work to revolve around the development of production, and we young students should respond by studying hard.

    青年歌声响彻古都！
    平市三万大中学生集会游行纪念五四
    叶市长号召青年学习建国工作
    【本报讯】本市华北大学、师范大学、北京大学、清华大学、辅仁大学等八十余大、中学校及青年团体等单位，分地区分别举行盛大的“五四”三十周年纪念。参加纪念会的大中学生及青年工人共约三万一千余人。各校分别邀请工人代表赵振邦同志及民主人士马叙伦、茅盾、张志让等先生，费青教授等出席讲话。各区在庆祝中都举行了游艺助兴。入夜各区学生分别举行营火晚会及火炬游行，悠扬的歌声，雄壮的军乐，歌声、掌声、欢呼声响彻了古都北平的街头。
    【本报讯】代表平市五十万各界青年的一千余青年代表，昨（四日）晚在国民大戏院举行盛大的五四纪念会，这是青年代表们在历史上第一次自由地纪念自己的节日。五点二十分大会开始，通过了彭真、叶剑英、沈钧儒、许立群等十七人为大会主席团。大会主席团主席许立群致词后，接着叶剑英市长讲话，叶市长回忆了革命事业的艰苦缔造，他勉励代表们说：“五四”运动已有三十年历史，在这三十年中，经过艰苦奋斗，现在反动势力已将被彻底全部消灭，人民胜利已经确定了。五四时代有许多先烈如李大钊同志牺牲了，他们用马列主义的理论教育了青年，现在全国青年应该团结起来学习先烈精神。我们的先驱者坚信人民革命事业的胜利，并不顾计本身的牺牲，把自己的鲜血头颅献给人民，坚持真理，为人民进行三十年奋斗，纪念五四，我们应学习这种精神，消灭反动势力。现在世界反革命势力还没有完全打垮，世界人民还没完全解放，我们仍要以武装斗争的精神，把政权掌握后，踏踏实实的建设，支持战争，把革命进行到底。青年是掌握未来的，学习如何建国，是艰巨的工作，知识青年要和工农结合，向他们学习一切生产知识，因为世界是劳动创造的，同时，还要学习马列主义理论，学习人民实际需要的东西，学习科学技术，将知识与实际斗争结合起来，在实际斗争中，修正我们在学习中的缺点，经过考验的知识，才是有用的。我们必须把学习与工作、学习与斗争，理论与实际结合起来。
    沈钧儒先生在讲话中说：纪念五四，必须要惩办卖国贼蒋介石及其死党；必须要把美帝国主义赶出中国去。
    吴玉章同志勉励青年们应继承五四精神，前仆后继的起来，与多方设法压迫中国人民的帝国主义和国内反革命势力斗争。
    接着有工人、农民、学生代表相继讲话，工人代表徐世荣说，过去工人和知识分子有很大的距离，这是旧社会所造成的，现在社会变了，我们应该携起手来，更坚强的奋斗。学生代表古奇琮说，毛主席号召一切工作都要围绕发展生产，我们青年学生就要以努力学习来响应。
