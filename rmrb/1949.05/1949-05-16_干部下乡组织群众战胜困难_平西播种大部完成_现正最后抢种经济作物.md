　　Cadres Go to the Countryside to Organize the Masses to Overcome Difficulties
    Most of the Sowing in Western Hebei Completed
  　Now Rushing to Plant Cash Crops
    [Chahar News] The drought resistance and sowing work in various parts of Western Hebei has been mostly completed. In the mountainous areas: Laiishui County has sown 80% of its corn, and it is expected to be completed before May 10th. Sowing in the first district of Fangshan has been completed. More than half of the field sowing in Wanping has also been completed, and cash crops are being sown in a concentrated effort. In the plains areas: Early-maturing crops (such as peas and barley) have been sown, and now cash crops are being rushed into the ground. Fangshan has mostly completed planting cotton and peanuts, and some villages have exceeded their original plans for cotton planting. In the sowing process in various places (especially for cash crops), except for a small portion of shady and wet land, some areas are using river water and well water for point sowing. In the point sowing, a competition has been launched, creating a wave of enthusiasm. For example, Wu Hudian in the Chenxiang district of Liangxiang challenged Huang Xindian to finish planting cash crops before May 5th. Huang Xindian not only accepted the challenge but also guaranteed to plant an additional ten mu. In the sowing in the mountainous areas, the difficulty of lacking manpower and farm tools was overcome by organizing the people. Cadres in the Laiishui County district concentrated their efforts on going to the countryside to lead the masses in carrying water for point sowing. They assigned tasks based on the physical strength of the masses, such as carrying water, lifting water, digging holes, and planting seeds, making full use of all farm tools, even including oil pots and lunch boxes, truly making water, people, and tools all work without idleness. In the sowing, priority was given to ensuring that the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers received their sowing tasks on time. In the plains areas, wells were drilled in large numbers. Each county sent capable cadres to lead the work.
    Now that the Beginning of Summer has passed, there are less than half a month left for planting cash crops. The Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office have issued a joint directive, pointing out that the mountainous areas should use the rich experience of drought resistance and sowing accumulated over the years to vigorously carry out drought resistance and sowing. Comrade Wang Xian of the Prefectural Committee personally went to Fangshan and Laishui counties to inspect water conservancy and convened a meeting of the county committees of the two counties to jointly resolve water conservancy disputes between the two counties.

    [Chahar News] After reviewing the spontaneous tendencies in production leadership, the first district of Huolu actively led the masses to carry water for point sowing of cotton. As of May 7th, statistics show that 600 mu had been sown, meeting the county's requirements for the district. Shijing Village, originally assigned 60 mu, has point-sown 120 mu. Dujiazhuang, planned for 100 mu, has point-sown 120 mu. The work is continuing in full swing.
    On the 19th of last month, all the cadres in the district reviewed the shortcomings in their leadership. After arriving in the villages, they first explained the benefits of growing cotton to the party members and cadres in the branch by using specific accounting methods, breaking the idea of relying on heaven for food among party members and cadres. Then, the party members and cadres took the lead in making plans.
    During the point sowing, Comrade Shi Ze, the district party secretary, personally helped a military family point-sow two mu. Comrade Zhang Shuwen, a district cadre, carried water for a military family for a day, influencing the most backward Shi Guilin to also point-sow one mu. The Dong Mingde mutual aid team in Dujiazhuang, consisting of seven men, four women, and five children, point-sowed eight and a half mu in two days. Many children and women in various villages participated in this movement, quickly completing the task. (Hou Yong)

　　干部下乡组织群众战胜困难
    平西播种大部完成
  　现正最后抢种经济作物
    【察哈尔讯】平西各地抗旱播种工作已大部完成。在山地：涞水玉米已下种百分之八十，预计五月十日前全部完成。房山一区播种已完成。宛平大田播种亦完成一半以上，经济作物正突击播种。在平原地区：早熟作物（如菀豆、大麦）已播种完毕，现正抢种经济作物。房山植棉种花生已大部完成，有的村植棉已超过了原计划，各地在播种中（尤其是经济作物），除小部阴湿地外，一部是利用河水、井水点种的。在点种中，开展竞赛造成了热潮。如良乡城厢区吴后店向黄辛店提出五月五日前种完经济作物，黄辛店除应战外，还保证多种十亩。在山地播种中，用组织起来的办法，克服了人力和家具缺乏的困难。涞水县区干部集中全力下乡领导群众挑水点种，按群众体力强弱分任担水、抬水、刨坑、下籽，把所有家具甚至连油篓饭盒都使用起来，真正作到了水、人、家具三不闲。在播种中首先保证烈、军、工属按时得到下种。平原地区则大量打井。各县均派出得力干部领导进行。
    现已过立夏，经济作物播种时间还不到半个月，地委专署特发出联合指示，指出山地要利用几年来抗旱播种的丰富经验，大力进行抗旱播种。地委王宪同志亲赴房山、涞涿两县视察水利，并召集该两县县委共同解决有关两县之水利纠纷。（平西地委办公室）
    【察哈尔讯】获鹿一区检讨了生产领导上的自流现象后，全体干部积极领导群众担水点种棉花，截止五月七日统计已种六百亩，已达到县里对该区的要求，石井村原分配六十亩，已点种了一百二十亩，杜家庄计划一百亩，点种了一百二十亩，现在正继续突击中。
    该区于上月十九日全区干部检讨了领导缺点，到村后首先在支部党员干部中以具体算帐方法说明种棉花的好处，打破党员、干部靠天吃饭思想，然后由党员干部首先做计划。
    在点种当中，区委书记石泽同志亲自帮助军属点种了二亩，区干张述文同志给军属担了一天水，影响了最落后的史桂林也点了一亩，杜家庄东明德互助组七个男人四个妇女五个儿童两天点了八亩半，各村不少儿童妇女都参加了这一运动，迅速完成了任务。  （侯永）
