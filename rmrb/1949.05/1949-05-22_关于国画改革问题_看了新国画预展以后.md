　　Regarding the Reform of Traditional Chinese Painting
 　　After Seeing the Preview of New Chinese Paintings
　　Cai Ruohong

　　Since the liberation of Beiping, influenced by a great social transformation and encouraged by the emergence of many new things, many painters engaged in traditional Chinese painting have deeply felt the urgent need to reform traditional Chinese painting, so that it, like other arts, can adapt to the demands of the broad masses of people, thereby achieving the goal of serving the people. To this end, they have held several forums to exchange views on how to reform traditional Chinese painting. Moreover, in more than two months, they created more than two hundred new works, taking the first step in the creative practice of new Chinese painting. It should be pointed out that this is a gratifying phenomenon, a progressive phenomenon, and a phenomenon that the declining traditional Chinese painting art is beginning to turn to new life. In this exhibition, no matter how many defects (or even serious defects) still exist, this is an inevitable problem in the process of reform. We should pay attention to its development prospects, and at the same time, we should raise the problems existing in these works for mutual research and discussion, the purpose of which is to promote the progress of this art reform work.

　　In the more than two hundred works in this preview, reflecting the lives of the working people, reflecting agricultural production, and reflecting the victory of the People's Liberation Army and the relationship between the army and the people are relatively common themes. From the history of traditional Chinese painting, the application of such themes is the first relatively concentrated attempt. Its significance is not only in the description of the content, breaking through the old patterns of mountains, forests, flowers, grasses, birds, beasts, insects and fish; not only in the creative attitude, sweeping away the decadent emotions of "cherishing the ancient and returning to nature"; but more importantly, bringing the traditional Chinese painting art, which has always been separated from real life, to the road of combining with real life. It should be affirmed that this shift in creative content is an important key to reforming traditional Chinese painting and the main sign that distinguishes new Chinese painting from old Chinese painting.

　　Of course, the importance I emphasize on the transformation of creative content only refers to the primary step in reforming traditional Chinese painting. This does not mean that this transformation has completely solved all the problems of traditional Chinese painting reform; it does not mean that this transformation can vividly and profoundly reflect reality. There are examples before us: the farmers in some pictures still have ancient hair buns on their heads and ancient clothes on their bodies; the farmers in some pictures, although they are working, are so leisurely and the environment is so elegant; if compared with the "Rural Pleasure Pictures" in old Chinese paintings, it is difficult to find any difference in the image. On such pictures, we can write words of production labor, but why can't we write lyrics similar to the Taoist songs of Mr. Banqiao? There are many similar works. The reason is that the authors still have a certain distance from the understanding of the working people, and the old traditional techniques are quite stubbornly glued to the authors' wrists. All of these can be gradually overcome over time. But we must recognize that our praise for labor is because laborers created the world and have the power to change the world; our promotion of production is because the peasants who eliminated the feudal system have become the masters of the land, and improving production is also improving the living enjoyment of the peasants themselves; this is different from the gentlemen of the scholar-official class who resigned from their posts and returned to their hometowns, flattering and praising the peasants in poems and paintings: "You are very good, you are self-sufficient, you are indifferent to the world, you are accompanied by beautiful nature every day, I really envy you!" Such a position of reassuring people to be exploited is two different positions and two different intentions. If we recognize this, I believe that painters can correct the shortcomings in these works. Therefore, the authors of new Chinese paintings should not only face the creation theme squarely, but also face the reality squarely. It is completely right to choose the working people as the creative theme, but how to correctly reflect this theme depends on the painters' deep understanding of real life, and depends on strengthening the study of revolutionary theory and the observation of practical life. This is the necessary path for the combination of art and the working people, and the necessary path for the reform of traditional Chinese painting. Whether new Chinese painting can grow healthily and whether it can meet the needs of the masses will also be determined by whether the painters have a loyal service spirit and a serious creative attitude.

　　Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of technical learning in traditional Chinese painting, which is also quite important in the reform of traditional Chinese painting. The so-called traditional Chinese painting, I think it should refer to a specific way of painting expression. It preserves certain painting tools (which is not related to the reform of traditional Chinese painting) and also retains certain learning methods, a blind learning method of looking up to the ancients and looking up to the predecessors: the imitation of styles, the inheritance of copies and rubbings, and the inheritance of clothing from generation to generation, turn traditional Chinese painting creation into eternal exercises, limit traditional Chinese painting to a narrow circle of skills, and create an unbreakable simple technical view in the minds of people who study and appreciate traditional Chinese painting; In addition, the individual division of labor in the description of objects (aren't there many experts in our history of traditional Chinese painting who specialize in painting plums, orchids, tigers, and horses?), the expression technology is narrowed to a narrower circle, and the view of technology for technology is strengthened; Under such learning conditions, the so-called content of the work has become an appendage. It is just a few patterns pieced together by tangram puzzles. It is just a corpse in the resurrection. For many years, our painters have been wandering in this technical alley, unable to see any new things in the world. This is the objective reason why Chinese painters can only imitate the past but cannot pass on the present, and why they have turned traditional Chinese painting into a pen and ink game for a few people (of course, there are also subjective factors starting from class thinking). In this exhibition of new Chinese paintings, it is not difficult for us to find such traces: on the one hand, due to the technical adherence to the old ways, accustomed to describing a certain fixed image, today, once breaking the scope of description, to engage in multi-faceted description, it is inevitable to be constrained, incompatible, some cancel the characters that should be in the picture, some simply paint what they are good at, only adding some symbolic and metaphorical words (some are very inappropriate words) in the inscription to decorate the new content. On the other hand, because the technical learning of traditional Chinese painting has always been looking up to the ancients, once it is used to express modern themes, the picture is inevitably full of ancient style, ancient flavor, and ancient meaning; losing the reality and vividness of the image, castrating the function that traditional Chinese painting should have. All these shortcomings, we cannot but blame on the old traditional technical learning methods. Therefore, in the reform of traditional Chinese painting, this issue should be placed in the second most important position. I propose that painters engaged in traditional Chinese painting should do more figure sketches in their technical learning in the future, abandon those one-sided and isolated specialized techniques, and cultivate the descriptive skills of various things. Of course, copies are not absolutely impossible to copy, and styles can also be referred to, but they can only become the nourishment of technical learning, but cannot become the shackles of technical learning. I believe that as long as the painters continue to work hard, this technical problem is easy to solve.

　　Due to space limitations, I can only raise the more important issues, and I have not said everything completely. I hope that the gentlemen who are working hard on the reform of traditional Chinese painting will correct me if there is anything inappropriate.

　　关于国画改革问题
  　看了新国画预展以后
    蔡若虹
    北平解放后，由于一个巨大的社会变革所影响，由于许多新事物的呈现所鼓舞，很多从事国画制作的画家们，深切地感到国画有急须改革的必要，使国画也和其它艺术一样地适应于广大人民的要求，从而达到为人民服务的目的。为了这，他们曾先后召开了好几次座谈会，交换了如何改革国画的意见，而且，在两个多月的时间中，一共制作了两百余幅新作，让新国画在创作实践中跨开了第一步。应该指出：这是一个可喜的现象，一个进步的现象，是颓废不振的国画艺术开始转向新生的现象。在这次展出的作品里，无论它还存在着若干缺陷（甚或是严重的缺陷），但这是改革过程中不可避免的问题，我们应该重视它的发展前途，同时，也应该将这些作品中所存在的问题提出，以作相互的研究与商讨，其目的是推进这一艺术改革工作的进展。
    在这次预展的两百余幅作品中，反映劳动人民的生活，反映农业生产，反映人民解放军的胜利和军民关系，是比较普遍的主题。关于这类主题的应用，从国画的历史上来看倒还是第一次比较集中的尝试。它的重大意义，不仅是描写内容上，突破了过去的那些山林花草，鸟兽虫鱼的陈套；不仅是在创作态度上，扫除了那种“缅怀远古，皈依自然”的颓败情绪；而更重要的是，将从来是与现实生活游离的国画艺术拉到与现实生活结合的道路上来。应该肯定：这一创作内容的转变，是改革国画的重要关键，也是新国画区别于旧国画的主要标志。
    当然，我所强调的创作内容转变的重要，仅是指改革国画的首要步骤而言，这还不等于说有了这个转变，就全盘的解决了国画改革的诸般问题；不等于说有了这个转变，国画就能够生动地深刻地反映现实；眼前有这样的例子：有的画面上的农民，头上还挽着古代的发髻，身上还穿着古代的衣裳；有的画面上的农民，虽说是在劳动，姿态却如此的悠闲而环境又如此的典雅；假若和旧国画中的“农家乐事图”两相比较，那就很难从形象上找出不同之点来。在这样的画面上，我们题上生产劳动的词句是可以的，但如果题上类乎板桥先生的道情一样的歌词又何尝不可以？类似这样的作品尚多，推其缘因，不外是作者对于劳动人民的认识尚有一定的距离，而旧传统的技术又相当固执地胶着在作者的腕底，这都可以从时间上来逐渐克服的。但我们必须认清：我们的歌颂劳动，是因为劳动者创造了世界，而且也有力量来改变世界；我们的提高生产，是因为消灭了封建制度以后的农民已成为土地的主人，提高生产也就是提高农民自己的生活享受；这和解宦归田的士大夫阶级的老爷们在诗词画幅中对农民的阿谀赞美：“你很好，你自给自足，你与世无争，你天天和优美的大自然为伴，我真羡慕你啊！”那样叫人安心于被剥削的地位是两种不同的立场，两种不同的意图，如果认清了这点，我相信画家们是可以纠正这些作品中的缺点的。因此，新国画的作者不仅要正视创作主题，而且要正视现实。选择劳动人民为创作主题是完全对的，但如何正确的反映这一主题，却有赖于画家们对现实生活的深刻理解，有赖于加强革命理论的学习和生活实际的观察，这是艺术与劳动人民结合的必经之途，也是国画改革工作的必经之途。新国画是否能健康的成长，是否能适合群众的要求，也将以画家们是否有忠诚的服务精神，是否有严肃的创作态度来决定。
    其次，我想谈谈关于国画的技术学习问题，这在国画改革工作上也是相当重要的。所谓国画，我想应该是指一种特定的绘画表现方式而言，它保存着一定的绘画工具，（这与改革国画无关）也保留着一定的学习方法，一种盲目的向古人看齐，向先辈看齐的学习方法：风格的仿效，粉本的因袭临摹，世世代代的衣钵相传，就把国画创作变成了永远的习作，就把国画局限在狭小的技艺的圈子里，就在学习国画和欣赏国画的人们的脑子里，造成了一种牢不可破的单纯技术观点；再加上描写对象上的个体分工（我们的国画史上不是有不少的画梅画兰画虎画马的专家么），就把表现技术缩小到更狭隘的圈子里，而且加强了为技术而技术的观点；在这样的学习情况之下，所谓作品内容，倒反而成为一种附属品，它不过是由七巧板拼凑而成的几种花样，它不过是借尸还魂中的一具尸体而已。多少年来，我们的画家们徘徊在这条技术的穷巷里，看不见世界上任何新鲜事物，这就是为什么国画家只能拟古而不能传今，为什么把国画变成了少数人的笔墨游戏的客观缘因（当然，也还有从阶级思想出发的主观因素在内）。在这次新国画的展出中，我们不难找出这样的痕迹：一方面由于技术上的墨守陈规，习惯于描写某种固定的形象，今天一打破描写的范围，要从事多方面的描写，就不免束手束脚，格格难入，有的取消了画面上应有的人物，有的索性画原来所擅长的东西，仅仅在题字上添加一些象征隐寓的词句（有些是很不妥当的词句），以装饰为新的内容。另一方面由于国画的技术学习从来是向古人看齐，一旦拿来表现现代的题材，画面上就不免充满了古风古气，古意盎然；失去了形象的真实与生动，阉割了国画应有的功能。所有的这些缺点，我们不能不归罪于旧传统的技术学习方法，因此，在国画改革工作上，应该把这一问题摆在第二个重要地位。我提议：从事国画的画家们今后在技术学习上，应该多作人物写生，抛弃那些片面的孤立的专技，培养多方面事物的描写技能。当然，粉本不是绝对不可以临摹，风格也未尝不可以参考，但它只能成为技术学习的滋养品，而不能成为技术学习的桎梏。我认为，只要画家们不断的努力，这一技术问题是易于解决的。
    因为限于篇幅，我只能把比较重要的问题提出，而且也没有说得完全，不妥之处，尚望努力于国画改革工作的先生们指正。
