    Pingshan and Huolu
    Rescuing from Hail Disaster
    [Chahar News] On the 16th of this month, at approximately 4 p.m., Huolu County experienced a sudden hailstorm. The hailstones were as large as dates, and the storm lasted for half an hour. Twenty-six villages were generally affected, with wheat fields, cotton, early-maturing crops, and vegetables generally suffering losses in the affected villages. Deputy County Chief Cui and others immediately went to the villages to investigate the disaster situation and lead the masses to replant. The county party committee also instructed each district to immediately send cadres to the disaster-stricken villages to organize the masses to replant and rush-plant autumn crops. Most of the unissued production loans were transferred to these disaster-stricken villages to support the masses in production.
    [Further News] Over one hundred and thirty villages in Pingshan also suffered from a hailstorm at the same time. The county party committee immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss emergency rescue measures and organize the masses in disaster-stricken villages to protect and replant seedlings.
