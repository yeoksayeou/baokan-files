Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th: In the Shanghai liberation campaign, as of the evening of the 28th, according to incomplete statistics, the People's Liberation Army has captured and accepted the surrender of approximately 100,000 officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army. A large amount of spoils were seized and are currently being inventoried.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government was established on the 28th. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission has appointed Chen Yi as Mayor of Shanghai, and Zeng Shan, Pan Hannian, and Wei Que as Deputy Mayors.
