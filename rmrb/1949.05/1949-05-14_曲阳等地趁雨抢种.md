[Da Haer News] On the morning of May 1st, Quyang County experienced approximately ten hours of spring rain. About one hundred villages in the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts were thoroughly soaked and suitable for planting. While the remaining one hundred and twenty-two villages were not completely soaked, the land could be cultivated and clods broken in preparation for planting. During the rain, the county was holding a meeting of county and district cadres. To ensure that the rain-affected areas completed planting on time (especially special crops), the county party committee immediately organized capable cadres, led personally by Deputy County Head Tang of the government, to go to the rain-affected villages to organize the masses to urgently cultivate the land and plant seeds after the rain stopped. To strengthen leadership, the ongoing cadre meeting was shortened by two days. (Yang Hongchuan, Zhang Dangui)

[Taihang News] Party members in Wulihou, Lucheng, take the lead in planting by the "mou" (unit of area). On April 25th, there was a thorough rain. Village cadres and party members went into the mutual aid teams to explain the importance of increasing production, and led by example with their own actions. Production Director Wang Gengyin took the lead in planting, applying double fertilizer to his 5.5 "mu" of corn. A movement for increased production planting has formed throughout the village. The masses said, "The 'smelly furniture' (referring to manure buckets) in our village these days is really faster than a bowl." Li Jianliang, unable to borrow a manure bucket, pulled fertilizer to the fields at night. Because of their active production from early morning to late evening, the 84 households originally planted 101 "mu" of Jin Huanghou (corn variety), now increased to 215.9 "mu". Currently, 501.3 "mu" of autumn land have been plowed, and the whole village is continuing to plant.

[This newspaper reports] On the morning of April 28th, while it was raining, the Luoluo Village branch in Xingtai held a meeting of cadres above the team leader level to discuss planting after the rain. On the 29th, party member cadres personally led the planting of 52.5 "mu" of peanuts in one day. During the rush planting, the masses said, "This saves so much work. The weather is still windy. If we don't rush like this, every day counts against us."
Also, in Yingtou Village, District Seven of Xingtai, there was a two or three "zhi" (finger, unit of measure) rain on the 25th. That evening, the village cadres convened a general meeting of party member cadres and mutual aid team leaders to discuss taking advantage of the rain to launch a shock planting. Everyone said, "The rain is light, and the land is not soaked enough. Let's mobilize the masses to carry water and plant during the rain. This will save more labor than carrying all the water, and the seedlings will emerge completely." The next day, early in the morning, under the leadership of cadres and team leaders, men, women, old, and young went to the fields with buckets and seeds, planting more than 50 "mu" of cotton and peanuts in one day.

    曲阳等地趁雨抢种
    【达哈尔讯】五月一日上午，曲阳县境内降落春雨约达十小时。五、六、七三个区约一百个村庄已下透。能够播种；其余一百二十二个村庄虽没下透，但可耕地、打土坷拉，准备点种。下雨时县里正开着县区干部会议，为保证落雨地区按时完成播种（尤其是特种作物），雨止后，县委马上组织得力干部，由政府唐副县长亲自带领，立即赴落雨村庄组织群众突击耕地播种。为加强领导，把正开着的干部会，又缩短两天。（扬洪川，张丹桂）
    【太行讯】潞城五里后党员带头趁垧栽种。四月二十五日天降透雨，该村干部党员深入互助组说明增产重要，又用自己的模范行动带头。生产主任王庚寅首先下种，将自己的五亩五分玉茭上了双层肥，全村的增产播种形成了运动。群众说：“俺村这几天的臭家具（指粪桶）真比碗还快哩。”李建良因借不上粪桶，夜间往地拉着肥。由于他们起五更搭黄昏积极生产，八十四户原种金皇后一百零一亩，现增到二百一十五亩九分。现犁下秋地五百零一亩三分，全村正在继续下种中。

    【本报讯】四月二十八日午前正在下雨，邢台路罗村支部预先开了组长以上的干部会，研究雨后下种问题。二十九日党员干部亲自领导，一天抢种花生五十二亩半。抢种中群众说：“这省多少工，天还是刮风，如不这样抢，过一天就算一天的垧。”
    又邢台七区营头村在二十五日落了二三指雨，当晚村干部便召开了党员干部和互助组长全体会议，讨论趁垧突击下种，大家说：“下的雨少垧不饱，咱们可动员群众趁雨担水点种，这样比全担水省工，苗出的齐全。”第二天一早在干部组长的领导下，男女老少都带着水桶种子往地走，一天即点种五十余亩棉花和花生。
