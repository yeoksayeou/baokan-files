    【本报讯】保定筑路处来平给毛主席献旗典礼，于昨（二十一日）八时在平津铁路局第二分馆大礼堂举行，由平津路局政治部宣传部陈春森部长代表受旗。仪式简短隆重。陈部长在欢迎词中说明把大家的心意，全部转告毛主席，并勉励大家应准备完成更大的建设计划，应加强政治和业务的学习，并做好工会工作，作到人民解放军打到那里，我们保证把路修到那里，相信我们也一定能完成这一伟大的计划。工人代表王海讲话，说明一定遵照上级的指示，努力学习政治和业务，不骄傲，不夸功，成立职工会，以保证完成伟大的建设计划。随后由参加过“二七”罢工的老工人杨士俊、并在此次筑路中荣获筑路模范的老工人王名溪献旗，全体工人高呼：“庆祝平保通车，修好平汉路，迎接全国胜利！”“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”掌声和欢呼声淹没了一切。
