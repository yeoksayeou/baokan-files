    Conducting Education on the Materialist Conception of History is the Primary Political Task in Current Worker Education
    The education of the materialist conception of history, in a word, is the education of class struggle. To carry out such education is to make the working class understand the principle that labor creates the world; to know that the laboring masses who produce material resources are the creators of history; to know what the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are, what the capitalist methods of exploitation and the system of exploitation are; to know what socialism and communism are, and that capitalism will inevitably and has already begun to be replaced by socialism and communism; to know that class struggle is the driving force of the development of class society, and what historical mission the Chinese working class bears, who it should lead, who it should unite with, and who it should wage its struggle against; to know that the Party is the highest organized and advanced force of the class, and that the Chinese Communist Party and the International Communist Party are the highest organized and advanced forces of the Chinese working class and the international working class. Only after understanding all this will the Chinese working class act as a conscious class and become a force that the Communist Party can rely on.
    In leading the restoration and development of industrial production, in leading the management and construction of cities, and in leading the urban people to struggle against imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and bureaucratic capitalists, the Chinese Communist Party must first and foremost rely on the strength of the Chinese working class. But to rely on this force, this class must be a conscious working class, not an unconscious one. The unconscious working class is one that has not yet truly understood the truth of class struggle, has not yet truly understood its own position, strength, tasks, and future, and has not yet truly recognized its own vanguard—the Communist Party. Whether the working class is conscious or not is related to the success or failure of the entire Chinese revolution, and the key to its consciousness lies in whether correct political education, first and foremost education on the materialist conception of history, has been carried out among the working class.
    All the facts in the newly liberated cities prove that the Chinese working class hates the Kuomintang and supports the Communist Party. This is the result of the Kuomintang's reactionary policies over the years and the Communist Party's revolutionary struggle over the years. But we must also see that the Chinese Communist Party was forced to turn to the countryside for a long time, separated from its class ranks, that is, the urban working class. During this period, the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism carried out systematic reactionary deceptive education to the urban people, and this deception inevitably hindered many workers from quickly gaining a full understanding and trust in the Communist Party and the people's democratic government it led. Under such circumstances, it is all the more necessary to carry out education on the materialist conception of history for the entire working class.
    Once liberated from a long period of oppression and deception, the working class urgently demands to understand current events and policies, and to improve their skills and culture. We should try our best to meet these demands. But more important and more fundamental is to carry out education on the materialist conception of history for them. Without the theory of the materialist conception of history, without the class analysis of Chinese society, our various policies and explanations of the domestic and international situation in the stage of the new democratic revolution become unfounded. On the other hand, if the working class remains in a state of insufficient political consciousness due to the lack of education on the materialist conception of history, then other education will also lack its due significance and effectiveness.
    It is easiest for the working class to accept the basic concepts of the materialist conception of history. The working class is the class of production, the easiest to understand the meaning of labor and production, and the easiest to recognize their own strength. The Chinese working class has suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression, and has experienced all kinds of revolutionary and reactionary events, making it easiest to understand what class is and what class struggle is. Our worker training classes or study groups must take the explanation of the basic concepts of the materialist conception of history to workers as the main content of education. Needless to say, teaching theoretical courses on the materialist conception of history to workers especially requires the instructors to start from the workers' own experiences, from practical things, and not from ancient things and difficult terms that are far from the workers' real lives. Dogmatic indoctrination will definitely not achieve good results.
    The current task of worker education is to awaken the class consciousness of the working class. All enterprises in all liberated cities throughout the country should, according to specific conditions, conduct education on the materialist conception of history for workers for a period of one month at most and one week at least. It is necessary to carry out policy, current affairs, and cultural education, and it is also necessary to open worker cultural night schools, but education on the materialist conception of history is of greater importance in awakening the revolutionary consciousness of the entire working class.
    In the public enterprises of Tianjin and Beijing, after organizing workers to study political common sense, many activists emerged from among the workers who began to have political consciousness. They played a great role in numerous moving events such as launching production competitions, completing production tasks, improving skills, and saving raw materials. It can be foreseen how great a force the entire working class will exert after they have been awakened. Strengthening education on the materialist conception of history aims to awaken the infinite power hidden in the working class. Relying on this power, the Communist Party has the guarantee to unite all democratic forces to complete the task of the New Democratic Revolution, rapidly restore and develop production, and transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, until it moves towards socialism.

### 进行唯物史观的教育是当前职工教育中的首要政治任务

    进行唯物史观的教育是当前职工教育中的首要政治任务
    所谓唯物史观的教育，一句话，就是阶级斗争的教育。进行这样的教育，就是要使工人阶级知道劳动创造世界的道理；知道生产物质资料的劳动群众是历史的创造者；知道什么是资产阶级和无产阶级，什么是资本主义的剥削方法和剥削制度；知道什么是社会主义和共产主义，而资本主义则必然并已经开始被社会主义和共产主义所代替；知道阶级斗争是阶级社会发展的原动力，而中国工人阶级则负着怎样的历史使命，应当领导谁，联合谁，向谁去进行自己的斗争；知道党是阶级的最高的有组织的先进的部队，而中国共产党和国际共产党则是中国工人阶级和国际工人阶级的最高的有组织的先进的部队。只有在懂得了这一切之后，中国工人阶级才会作为一个觉悟了的阶级而行动起来，才会成为共产党足以依靠的力量。
    中国共产党在领导恢复和发展工业生产中，在领导管理和建设城市中，在领导城市人民向帝国主义者、国民党反动派及官僚资产阶级进行斗争中，首先而且主要地要依靠中国工人阶级的力量。但是要依靠这个力量，就必须使这个阶级是觉悟了的工人阶级，而不是不觉悟的工人阶级。不觉悟的工人阶级，即是尚未真正认识到阶级斗争的真理，尚未真正认识到自己的地位、力量、任务和前途的工人阶级，即是尚未真正认识自己的先锋队——共产党——的工人阶级。工人阶级的觉悟与否，关系到整个中国革命的成败，而其觉悟与否的关键，则在于是否向工人阶级作了正确的政治教育，首先是唯物史观教育。
    一切新解放城市中的事实，都证明中国工人阶级痛恨国民党而拥护共产党。这是国民党多年的反动政策和共产党多年的革命斗争所造成的结果。但是我们必须同时看到，中国共产党曾被迫长期地转入农村，与自己的阶级队伍即城市工人阶级相隔绝。这期间，国民党和日本帝国主义曾向城市人民进行了有系统的反动欺骗教育，这种欺骗当然不能不在一定程度上妨碍许多工人对共产党及其领导的人民民主政府迅速得到充分的了解和信托。在这种情况之下，对整个工人阶级进行唯物史观的教育尤为必要。
    在一旦从长期被压迫，被蒙蔽的境遇里解放出来之后，工人阶级迫切要求了解时事和政策，要求提高技术和文化。我们应当尽量满足他们的这些要求。但更其重要，更其根本的是对他们进行唯物史观的教育。离开了唯物史观的学说，离开了对中国社会的阶级分析，我们在新民主主义革命阶段中的各项政策和对国内外时局的说明，就成了没有依据的东西。另一方面，如果工人阶级因缺乏唯物史观教育之故仍然停留在政治上觉悟不足的状态，那么，其他的教育也将缺少应有的意义和成效。
    工人阶级接受唯物史观的基本概念是最容易的。工人阶级是生产的阶级，最容易懂得劳动和生产的意义，最容易认识自己的力量。中国工人阶级曾经遭受种种剥削压迫，经历种种革命和反动的事变，最容易理解什么是阶级以及什么是阶级斗争。我们的职工训练班或学习组一定要把对工人讲解唯物史观的基本概念作为主要的教育内容。不用说，对工人讲授唯物史观这样的理论课程，特别要求讲授者从工人的切身经验，从实际事物出发，而不要从远离工人现实生活的古代事物和难解的名词出发。教条式的灌输是决然得不到好效果的。
    当前职工教育的任务就是唤起工人阶级的阶级觉悟。全国已解放的各个城市的各个企业单位，均应按照具体条件以多则一月少则一周的时间对工人进行唯物史观的教育。进行政策、时事以及文化教育是必要的，开办工人文化夜校之类也是必要的，但是唯物史观的教育，对于唤起整个工人阶级的革命觉悟，却有更大的重要性。
    平津两地各公营企业单位在组织职工进行政治常识的学习后，在开始有了政治觉悟的工人中间即涌现了不少的积极份子。他们在展开生产竞赛，完成生产任务，改进技艺，节省原料等等无数的动人事例中起了很大的作用。可以预见整个工人阶级在有了觉醒之后，将会发挥多么伟大的力量。加强唯物史观的教育，目的就在唤起蕴藏在工人阶级中的无穷无尽的力量，依靠这种力量，共产党就有保证来团结一切民主力量完成新民主主义的革命任务，迅速地恢复与发展生产，把中国由农业国变成工业国，直到走向社会主义。
