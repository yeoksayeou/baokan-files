Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: TASS, New York - Representatives of American business circles predict a greater recession in the American economy. The *Journal of Commerce*, mouthpiece of the American business community, published a statement on the 19th by its editor, Roodick, at the annual meeting of the National Association of Credit Men, saying: There is no longer any doubt that the American economy is now in a "cyclical downward trend," which could lead to a 20 percent decrease in industrial production by early next year compared to the wartime peak (1943), and even a 30 or 40 percent decrease in the heavy industry sector.

On the same day, the *Journal of Commerce* stated in an editorial that it believes the United States is suffering an industrial crisis and criticized officials who attempt to cover up the true situation with optimistic rhetoric. Businessmen are increasingly impatient with officials' claims that the economy has gone through a period of "sound adjustment" and that there is no sign of a deepening or prolonged recession. They have reason to feel annoyed.

Rayneson, Vice President of an important banking trust company, said in a speech in Minneapolis on the 7th: "In the past six months, the decline in industrial productivity has been quite frequent. I believe this trend will continue." According to Rayneson, the overall production is predicted to decline by 15 to 20 percent. Recent official and unofficial statistics released in the United States support this argument. It is estimated that industrial production has declined by nearly 10 percent since last October. In the field of industrial production, steel production, which has always been the most robust sector in the American economy, has also suffered a small but frequent decline.

Accompanying the decline in production is an increasing number of unemployed. The New York State Department of Labor announced on the 18th that there are now 468,000 unemployed workers in New York State. Chicago newspapers reported that Illinois authorities estimate that the number of unemployed in Chicago increased from 90,000 in mid-January to 120,000 in mid-March. Ewan Clague, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, warned in a speech in New York on the 18th that unemployment is expected to increase significantly in June, when many young people who have just graduated from high school and college will not be able to find jobs. *U.S. News & World Report* pointed out in a recent issue that the total number of unemployed by early next year could reach 6 million, and some government officials predict even higher numbers. This figure does not include the number of partially unemployed people. According to available official statistics, there are nearly 10 million semi-unemployed people (i.e., people who work less than the statutory 40 hours per week), while unofficial estimates put the figure at over 12 million.

### 美国经济正衰退中　明年初工业将有更大下降  美经济专家们一致承认

　　美国经济正衰退中
  　明年初工业将有更大下降
    美经济专家们一致承认
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国企业界的代表们预料美国经济将有更大的衰退。美国企业界的喉舌商务日报十九日发表该报主编鲁迪克在信用调查人全国协会年会上的声明，他说：不容再有任何疑问的是美国经济现在正处于“周期性的下降倾向”中，这种倾向能够在明年初使得工业生产比着战时的最高峰（一九四三年）下降百分之二十，而且在重工业部门甚至下降百分之三十或四十。
    同日商务日报在社论中表示相信美国正在遭受工业危机，并且批评那些企图用乐观的论调来掩盖真实情况的官员们。企业界人士对于官员们所谓经济走过了“健全调整”的时期，而且看不到有什么加深的拖长的衰退之类的论调，日益表示不耐。他们感觉烦恼，是有理由的。
    重要的银行业信托公司的副总裁雷埃森七日在明尼亚波利斯演讲称：“在过去六个月里，工业生产率的下降颇为经常。我相信这种倾向将要继续下去。”根据雷埃森的话，预测整个生产将要下降百分之十五至二十。最近美国发表的官方的与非官方的统计材料，都在支持着这个论点。据估计，自去年十月以来，工业生产几已下降百分之十。在工业生产的领域里，一向在美国经济中是最坚挺部门的钢铁生产，也遭受到虽小而经常的下降。
    伴随着生产下降而来的，是日益增多的失业。纽约州劳工部在十八日宣布：现在纽约州的失业工人有四十六万八千人。芝加哥报载：伊里诺斯州当局估计芝加哥的失业人数从一月中旬的九万人增加到三月中旬的十二万人。美国劳工统计专员克莱格于十八日在纽约演讲时警告称：预料失业将于六月显著增加，届时，许多刚从中学和大学毕业的青年将不可能找到工作。美国新闻与世界报道杂志在最近一期中指出：明年初的失业总人数可能达到六百万人，而有些政府官员预测的数字，甚至还要大些。这个数字并不包括部分失业的人数，根据现有的官方统计，半失业者（即每周工作不足法定的四十小时的人）几达一千万人，而非官方估计数字则达一千二百余万人。
