Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 27th. According to Ge Baoquan, a member of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress: the people of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union are deeply interested in our culture. When the delegation arrived in Czechoslovakia, the "Liberated China" exhibition was being held in Prague, the capital of Czech. Huge posters of the exhibition were posted everywhere on the streets. This exhibition gave a general introduction to the Chinese people's liberation war and production and construction. When the Peace Congress opened at the Czech Parliament, a special room was set aside next to the conference hall for a Chinese painting exhibition, which displayed many woodcuts and paintings by Gu Yuan and others, as well as paper-cuts. Scholars at the Czech Oriental Institute are working hard to translate Chinese literary works. The "Travels of Lao Ts'an" and other books translated by Průšek were published not long ago. Průšek was the first person to translate Lu Xun's works. He had corresponded with Mr. Lu Xun and translated "The True Story of Ah Q" and "Call to Arms." A new version of "The True Story of Ah Q" will be published soon. Mathesius' two-volume "Anthology of Chinese Poetry" is also very popular with Czech readers. In addition, Czech has also published a special magazine called "New Orient" to introduce Chinese culture and literary works.

When the delegation arrived in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, the Oriental Culture Museum in Moscow was holding a "Chinese Porcelain" exhibition. The Soviet State Publishing Bureau has published many books about China. New books include "China" by Maslennikov, Chen Boda's "The Four Big Families of China" translated by Jia Tao, the Russian translation of White's "Thunder Out of China," and "History of Chinese Art" by the head of the Chinese Department of the Oriental Culture Museum. In terms of literary works, Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River" has been translated into Russian and serialized in the "Banner" literary monthly since May of this year; Zhao Shuli's Russian translation of "Changes in Li Village" has been published in the second issue of this year's "Far East" literary monthly.

In addition, the People's Publishing House in Berlin, Germany, has translated Chairman Mao's report on literary and artistic issues into German. People's democratic countries in Southeast Europe such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania also want to obtain Chinese books, photos, movies, and paintings to hold exhibitions in various parts of their countries to help their people understand China more deeply.
