　　Notice from the North China People's Government:
    Business income tax on state-owned transportation enterprises such as postal, telegraph, and railways will be suspended; surcharges on public enterprises such as industrial and mining will also be suspended.

    [Our Newspaper] The North China People's Government recently issued a notice to all administrative offices, municipal governments, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Government, and all units under their jurisdiction to exempt state-owned transportation enterprises such as postal services and telecommunications from taxes and levies. The notice stated: The establishment of postal services, telecommunications, and railways is to serve the people and not for profit. Currently, after our takeover, these enterprises have suffered from war damage, with high expenditures and low income. Their expenses still rely on government assistance. In order to facilitate the development of transportation and telecommunications, it has been decided to suspend the collection of business income tax on the aforementioned public enterprises, and local areas shall not levy any additional taxes or levies on them. Public enterprises such as industry, mining, trade, river transportation, and highways shall still be implemented in accordance with Order No. 4 of this government's financial and tax regulations. Regarding the local surcharges on public enterprises, it was originally decided that local areas would collect them locally. However, according to feedback from various areas, public enterprises all have unified funds and unified profit calculations, making it impossible for local areas to audit and collect. Now, in order to facilitate payment, all such surcharges in various areas will also be suspended. All local construction expenses, in addition to other approved taxes, will be allocated 15% of the revenue from North China's public enterprises, based on the tax payments of public enterprises within each administrative office, province, municipality, and district, as a subsidy for local public services, to be uniformly allocated by this government.

　　华北人民政府通令：
    邮电铁道等国营交通事业
    一律停征营业所得税
  　工矿等公营企业附加税亦停征
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷通令各行署、盛市政府，绥蒙政府及该府所属各单位免除邮政、电讯等国营交通事业的捐税。该通令称：邮政、电讯、铁道之设立，系为人民服务，并不以营利为目的，目前此项事业，在我接管后，由于战争破坏，开支很大，收入亦少，其开支尚赖政府协助，为便于交通电讯事业之发展，决定对上述公营事业，一律停止征收营业所得税，各地亦不得对其征收任何附加捐税。至工矿、贸易、河运、公路等公营企业，仍按本府财税字第四号令规定执行。关于公营企业之地方附加，原决定由地方就地征收，但据各地反映，公营企业均系统一资金，统一利润计算，地方无法稽征，兹为便于交纳起见，各地此项附加税，亦一律停征，所有地方建设事业费用，除其他核准之税收外，另由华北公营企业收入中，按各该行署、省、市、区内公营企业之纳税额，划出百分之十五，作为各地地方事业费之补助，由本府统一批发。
