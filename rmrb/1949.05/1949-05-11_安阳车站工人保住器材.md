Anyang Station workers on the Pinghan Railway made every effort to protect railway equipment. Before the liberation of Anyang, the Kuomintang bandit troops extensively damaged the railway. In order to prevent the bandit troops from completely destroying the railway equipment, the workers refused the bandit troops' order to retreat into the city in the days before the People's Liberation Army began its offensive, and united to protect the equipment. They hid some important equipment in dark rooms or under the floor, sealed more than 30 tons of coal in train cars, and retained four complete locomotives and seventy-two train cars at the station. After the liberation of Anyang, they handed over all the protected items to the People's Liberation Army.

    安阳车站工人保住器材
    【新华社北平十日电】平汉路安阳车站工人尽力保护铁路器材。安阳解放前，国民党匪军曾对铁路大肆破坏，工人们为防止匪军将铁路器材全部破坏，在解放军开始进攻的前几天拒绝了匪军撤退进城的命令，并且一致团结起来保护器材。他们把一些重要器材藏在暗室里或地板下面，把三十多吨煤封藏在车皮里，在车站上则保留了四个完整的火车头和七十二辆车皮。安阳解放后，他们便将保护下来的东西全部交给了人民解放军。
