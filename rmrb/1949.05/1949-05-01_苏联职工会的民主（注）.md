Democracy in Soviet Trade Unions (Note)
By Keliyaqiao and Luosentali

Our country's trade unions were created after the Party was born, developed in brotherhood with the Party, and were consolidated under the leadership of the Party.

The Bolshevik Party, Lenin, and Stalin taught trade unions to rely on the creativity, initiative, and spontaneity of the broad masses of workers, technicians, and staff to establish all their work, attract workers, technicians, and staff to directly participate in the work of trade unions, and develop and consolidate trade union democracy.

The Soviet trade unions are the most democratic trade unions in the world.

The 10th Party Congress wrote in its resolution on the role and tasks of trade unions: "Trade unions should first of all become an organization in which every member is a conscious and active participant in the collective life of their trade union." The Congress suggested that all bodies engaged in the trade union movement should be elected through broad elections.

The 14th Party Congress further emphasized that the work of our trade unions should be based on the following: "(1) All bodies of the trade unions should be elected through broad elections; (2) Elected officials should give open, concise, and easily understood reports to their constituents; (3) Be sensitive and attentive to sound and realistic criticism from the masses; (4) Develop the initiative and spontaneity of ordinary members; (5) Simplify the structure of trade unions as much as possible and bring them closer to the masses."

The Party has always demanded that trade unions organize their work "so that every non-Party worker and staff member considers their trade union to be a close organization to them, elected by them, supervised by them, and reporting to them."

Soviet trade unions are carrying out their work on these foundations indicated by the Party.

At every stage of the working class's struggle to build socialism, our country's trade unions have shouldered more complex new tasks. Now—in the era of implementing the post-war Five-Year Plan, in the era of building communism—the fighting tasks of trade union organizations are: to more broadly unfold socialist emulation to complete and exceed the state plan, to spread the experience of innovators, and to tirelessly care for raising the material and cultural living standards of workers and staff.

The work of trade unions is currently being carried out under these signs: (1) Fully unfolding socialist emulation to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; (2) Increasing labor productivity, reducing costs, and improving product quality, establishing surplus accumulation of funds, and further improving the living standards of the Soviet people; (3) Uniting trade union members and all laborers more closely around the Bolshevik Party, around the great Stalin.

Trade unions are the most mass-based workers' class organizations.

Our country's trade unions are the most mass-based workers' class organizations. Stalin called trade unions the ordinary organizations of the working class, which is in a dominant position in our country, and called them schools of communism. The number of members of Soviet trade unions has now increased almost fifteen times compared to 1917.

Joining our trade unions is voluntary. Trade unions do not have restrictions based on social origin, nationality, religion, or other differences when recruiting members. There are no obstacles preventing any mental or manual worker employed by state-owned farms or cooperative farms, industrial or agricultural sectors, enterprises or institutions from joining a trade union. There is no need to have an apprenticeship record or skilled conditions to join a trade union. Every worker, staff member, and technician can become a trade union member from the first day of employment.

As soon as workers and staff enter an enterprise or institution, they receive the attention of the trade union. New members of the collective receive the concern of trade union organizers; if a new person is not a trade union member, the trade union organizer suggests that he submit an application. If a trade union member needs to improve his skill level, he will be sent to the Stakhanov school run by the factory committee. Working comrades—experienced cadre trainers—will teach young workers to learn rational work methods and will help them master their jobs.

Through production meetings, millions of workers are attracted to actively participate in the management of production. The participants in the production meetings, on the one hand, criticize the shortcomings in the work of the economic leaders, and at the same time, they put forward specific suggestions to help improve the organization of production work. Production meetings are a school that has been tested in practice to conduct production education for new strata of the working class. The Soviet trade unions are the direct organizers of production meetings.

One of the most important parts of trade union work is caring for the lives and health of laborers. If a trade union member is sick, a social insurance representative will go to his home to take care of this sick comrade. The Stalin Constitution guarantees the implementation of free medical care and sickness allowance system in the Soviet Union. Affectionately caring for the patient's family, arranging hospital meals, and receiving permits to go to sanatoriums according to the doctor's instructions—the work of social insurance representatives, namely, the members of the social insurance meeting and committee, is very extensive.

If a worker or staff member is dissatisfied with the work of a store or cafeteria, he can notify the factory committee, and the trade union's public inspector will review his opinion. More than 600,000 trade union activists are supervising the work of enterprises, trade, and public catering.

In the factory and in the club, in the public dormitory and in the clinic, in the night school for young workers and in the rest home, in short, trade union members are everywhere receiving the attention of their collective and trade union organization.

Activists are the factory committee's helpers and pillars.

The army of trade union activists numbers 7.6 million, including: members of factory committees and local committees, trade union organizers, committee members of various trade union bodies, social insurance representatives, public inspectors of labor protection, and public inspectors who supervise the work of canteens, shops, and other living facilities.

Activists are the factory committee's primary assistants in organizing socialist emulation and holding production meetings. They are concerned about fulfilling the obligations of collective contracts, improving production work, improving technology, and spreading the methods of Stakhanov workers. They supervise the implementation of labor legislation and technical safety regulations. They strive to reduce serious injuries and illnesses. They are also concerned with further improving medical services and the treatment of workers and staff in sanatoriums and rest homes, as well as Pioneer camps and children's playgrounds. They help the factory committee organize cultural and recreational activities. They hold reports and lectures, as well as plays and concerts, and attract workers and staff to participate in amateur art groups and sports teams.

Trade union members go to the factory committee—their close organization—to talk about their work, listen to opinions on private matters, get help, and offer suggestions on how to eliminate exposed shortcomings. The opinions and suggestions of trade union members are often the basis for raising new issues at factory committee meetings. Factory committee members, together with trade union activists, solve problems in various aspects of production, culture, and life for workers and staff in various enterprises.

Solving problems through consultation is the basic working method of trade union bodies. The consultation principle of social trade union organizations stipulates collective discussion of issues, unfolding criticism and self-criticism, and jointly formulating and adopting decisions. The agendas of all meetings, work plans, and draft resolutions of trade union organizations are usually prepared by the factory committee with the participation and assistance of members of workshop committees and committees attached to the factory committee, trade union organizers, and many ordinary trade union members.

All important work issues of trade union organizations are decided by mass meetings. Mass meetings are a school for conducting Bolshevik education for the masses, a place for expressing mass opinion, and a forum for criticism and self-criticism. When collective contracts were discussed in 1947 and 1948, 80 to 95 percent of workers attended mass meetings. Last year, more than 880,000 people attended these meetings. While criticizing shortcomings, participants also put forward concrete suggestions aimed at improving the organization of labor, mechanizing heavy work, improving technological processes, and improving cultural and living services for workers and staff. Hundreds of thousands of these suggestions were made, many of which were quickly implemented with the help of the public.

The vast masses of trade union members discuss and decide on the fundamental issues of their work and life, which is a huge educational task.

Comrade Zhdanov said in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) that the result of trade union's "educational work for its members should raise the level of trade union members to the level of understanding the tasks of the communist vanguard, that is, to the level of being a Party member; and prepare its outstanding members for joining the Party."

At present, when the Soviet people are victoriously advancing towards their great goal—communism—the organizational and educational tasks of trade unions have increased even more. Now, under the conditions of unprecedentedly high social activism of the masses and unprecedentedly increasing creativity and spontaneity, it is necessary to improve all the work of trade unions. The establishment of trade union conferences in various republics, border regions, and states will promote the improvement of trade union work. According to the decision of the 19th Plenary Session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, trade union conferences are elected by trade union delegate conferences, and their task is to implement measures between trade unions and coordinate the joint actions of trade union organizations in order to unfold socialist emulation to enable various enterprises to complete and exceed the state plan, and further improve the material and cultural life of workers and staff. Trade union conferences should summarize and spread the experience of trade union work, and lead cultural and sports institutions between trade unions.

The mutual coordination of the efforts of local trade union organizations will enhance the role of trade union organizations and consolidate their activities.

The organizational guiding principle of trade unions is democratic centralism.

Soviet trade unions and their bodies—from workshop committees and factory committees to central committees and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions—are established on a truly democratic basis. Our trade unions' organizational guiding principle is democratic centralism. Democratic centralism stipulates that all leading bodies of trade unions from the bottom up must be elected. The workshop committees and factory committees, state committees, republic committees, central committees, and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the trade unions are elected by secret ballot. Each committee has a certain term of office. The full term of workshop committees and factory committees is stipulated as one year.

Democratic centralism means that all bodies of trade unions have the obligation to give regular reports to their constituents. Workshop committees and factory committees should report to trade union members at least once every six months, explaining their activities, the work that has been completed, and the expenditures of the trade union.

The meaning of democratic centralism is also that the minority is subordinate to the majority and that lower-level bodies are subordinate to the decisions of higher-level bodies. All organizations of trade unions are independent and autonomous in deciding local issues, of course, as long as their resolutions do not conflict with the decisions of higher-level trade union bodies.

Comrade Stalin said in his closing remarks to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1937: "The non-Party masses, through non-Party activists and various mass meetings, test their economic leaders, trade union leaders, and other leaders. The non-Party masses listen to the reports of their leaders at mass meetings, criticize shortcomings, and point out the path to correct shortcomings."

Soviet trade unions have practiced these most important instructions of Comrade Stalin. The movement of holding report and election meetings conducted by trade union bodies has further consolidated the democracy of trade unions.

The stipulation of quorum for meetings is one of the most important requirements of trade union democracy. Only when at least two-thirds of trade union members attend report and election meetings can the meeting be legally effective.

The most important feature of socialist democracy is to conduct Bolshevik-style criticism and self-criticism. Trade union members criticize the activities of leaders, big and small, demanding the removal of shortcomings and the improvement of work. Criticism is an indispensable right of trade union members and is one of the principles of our democratic organizations. Criticism and self-criticism are not movements held only occasionally. Criticism and self-criticism have become the work of Soviet trade unions in the organization, and they are the constant stimulus for the continuous advancement of work.

The factory committee reports to and is supervised by trade union members.

The workshop committee and the factory committee systematically reporting to trade union members is an indestructible law of trade union democracy.

The factory committee reports to the voters how it has fulfilled its obligations and how it has mobilized the collective to complete political and economic tasks. It reports on the implementation of collective contracts, the implementation of the suggestions made by trade union members on contracts, and the implementation of work such as production plans and socialist obligations. It also reports on the organization and mass work carried out in the collective and the leadership of workshop committees and trade union organizers, as well as the expenditure in the trade union budget. It also reports to the mass meeting on the collective's production, wages and labor productivity, social insurance, development of gardening, and the workers' culture and life. The master of the trade union organization—the member—demands a detailed and self-critical report.

As a result of the elections conducted last year and now, advanced people—workers, engineers, technicians, foremen, staff, and cultural workers who have prestige and are respected among the masses—have been elected to the leading bodies of factory committees and local committees. Among those people are tens of thousands of women. 41.9 percent of the members of factory committees and local committees are women. 36 percent of the chairpersons of factory committees and local committees are women. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Party passed in 1948 on the March 8th International Women's Day said: "The ever-increasing social activism and political activism of women is one of the fundamental characteristics of socialist democracy."

The same characteristic of socialist democracy is attracting young people to participate in the daily work of social organizations, and of course also to participate in the activities of trade union factory committees, local committees, and workshop committees. Everywhere, young men and women workers and Communist Youth League leaders are elected as members of factory committees and local committees, and they decide on issues related to trade union members equally with adults.

In its work, the factory committee relies on a large number of activists and the masses who are creating the great cause of communist construction.

Lenin said: "The living creation of the masses is the fundamental factor of the new society." Our creative working day is a vivid testimony to Lenin's great words.

    苏联职工会的民主（注）
    克里亚契科  罗森塔利  作
    我们国家的职工会是在党产生了之后产生的，是在与党的友爱中发展起来的，是在党的领导下巩固起来的。
    布尔什维克党、列宁与斯大林教导职工会依靠工人、技术人员、职员的广大群众的创造性、积极性与自动性而建立职工会的全部工作，吸引工人、技术人员、职员直接参加职工会的工作，发展和巩固职工会的民主。
  苏联的职工会是世界上最民主的职工会
    党的第十次代表大会在其关于职工会的作用与任务决议案中写下了：“职工会首先应该成为这样一种组织：这种组织的每一个成员都是其职工会的集体生活的自觉而积极的参加者”。代表大会建议使从事职工运动的一切机关都是由广泛选举而产生的。
    党的第十四次代表大会又曾强调我们职工会的工作应该建立在这样一些基础上：“（一）职工会的一切机关都是由广泛选举而产生的；（二）由选举产生的任职人员对其选民应该作公开的、简明的、每一个工人都容易理解的汇报；（三）敏锐地、留意地对待健全的、实事求是的群众批评；（四）发展普通会员的积极性与自动性；（五）尽量地简化职工会的机构并使其接近群众”。
    党一直即在要求职工会将其工作组织得“使每一个非党的工人与职员都认为其职工会是他亲近的组织，是他所选出的，由他所监督的，并向他作汇报的”。
    苏联的职工会是在党所指示的这些基础上进行自己的工作的。
    在工人阶级为建立社会主义而斗争的每一个阶段，我们国家的职工会都曾负有更复杂的新任务。现在——在实行战后五年计划的年代中，在进行共产主义建设的年代中，职工会组织所负有的战斗任务乃是：更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛以求完成并超过国家计划，传播革新者的经验，不倦地关心于提高工人与职员的物质生活与文化生活的水平。
    职工会的工作目前是在这样的标志下进行的：（一）全力展开社会主义竞赛以求提前完成战后斯大林五年计划；（二）提高劳动生产率，减低成本与改进产品量质，建立超计划的资金积累，更进一步提高苏联人民的生活水平；（三）使职工会会员与一切劳动者更紧密地团结在布尔什维克党周围，在伟大的斯大林周围。
  职工会是最群众性的工人阶级组织
    我们国家的职工会是最群众性的工人阶级组织。斯大林将职工会称为在我们这里居统治地位的工人阶级的普通组织，称为共产主义的学校。苏联职工会的会员人数现在已几乎增加为一九一七年的十五倍了。
    加入我们的职工会，是自愿的。职工会吸收会员时，没有社会出身、国籍、信仰或其他差别的限制。对于任何受雇于国营农场或合作农场、工业部门或农业部门、企业或机关的脑力劳动或体力劳动的工作者，都没有使他不能加入职工会的障碍。加入职工会，是不需要有见习记录或熟练条件的。每一个工人、职员、技术人员从受雇后开始工作的第一天起，便可以成为职工会会员。
    工人与职员一进入企业或机关里，便受到职工会的关注。集体中的新成员是受到职工会组织者的关切的；如果新人不是职工会会员，职工会组织者便向他建议提出申请书。如果职工会会员需要提高自己的熟练程度，他便会被送到工厂委员会所开办的斯达哈诺夫学校去。工作同志——有经验的干部训练者，将教年青的工作者学会合理的工作方法，将帮助他精通业务。
    通过生产会议，成百万的工人被吸引去积极地参加管理生产。生产会议的与会者一方面批评经济领导者的工作中的缺点，同时并提出帮助改进生产的组织工作的具体建议。生产会议乃是在实践中考验了的对工人阶级的新阶层进行生产教育的学校。苏联的职工会便是生产会议的直接的组织者。
    职工会工作的一个最重要的部分，便是关心劳动者的生活与健康。如果职工会会员生病了，便有社会保险代表到他家里去照顾这生病的同志。斯大林宪法保障在苏联实行免费医疗与疾病津贴制度。友爱地关照病人的家庭，办理病号饭，按医生的指示领取赴休养院的准许证——社会保险代表即社会保险会议与委员会的委员的工作是很多的。
    如果工人或职员对于店铺或食堂的工作不满意，他可以通知工厂委员会，职工会的公务监察员便会审查他的意见。职工会的积极分子约六十万人以上，正监督着企业、贸易与公共伙食的工作。
    在工厂中和在俱乐部中，在公共宿舍中和在诊疗所中，在青年工人夜校中和在休息所中，总之，职工会会员到处都是受其集体及职工会组织的关注的。
  积极分子是工厂委员会的助手和支柱
    职工会积极分子大军为数共七百六十万人，其中包括：工厂委员会与地方委员会的委员，职工会组织者，职工会机关各委员会会员委员，社会保险代表，劳动保护公共视察员，监督食堂、店铺及其他生活机关的工作的公务监察员。
    积极分子是工厂委员会在组织社会主义竞赛和举行生产会议方面的首要助手。他们耽心于完成集体合同的义务，改进生产工作，改良技术，传播斯达哈诺夫工作者的方法。他们监督劳动立法与技术安全规则的执行。他们力求减低重伤和减少生病。他们并关心于更进一步改进医药服务和工人与职员在疗养院与休养院的治疗，及少先队营与儿童游戏场。他们帮助工厂委员会组织文化娱乐工作。他们举办报告与讲演，及演戏与音乐会，并吸引工人与职员参加业余艺术小组与体育团体。
    职工会会员到工厂委员会——他们亲近的组织那里去讲述自己的工作，听取关于私人事务的意见，获得帮助，提出如何肃清已暴露的缺点的建议。职工会会员的意见与建议，往往便是在工厂委员会会议上提出新问题的根据。工厂委员会委员和职工会积极分子一道，解决各企业中工人与职员的生产、文化及生活各方面的问题。
    借协议来解决问题，乃是职工会机关的基本工作方法。社会性的职工会组织的协议制原则，规定集体讨论问题，展开批评与自我批评，共同研制并采取决定。职工会组织的一切会议议程，工作计划与决定草案，通常都是在车间委员会委员与工厂委员会附设委员会委员、职工会组织者与许多普通职工会会员的参加和帮助下由工厂委员会准备起来的。
    职工会组织的一切重要的工作问题，都是由群众大会决定的。群众大会乃是对群众进行布尔什维克教育的学校，群众舆论的发表处，批评与自我批评的讲坛。在一九四七年与一九四八年讨论集体合同的时候，百分之八十至九十五的工作者都出席了群众大会。去年出席这种大会的人超过八十八万。与对缺点展开批评的同时，与会者也提出了具体的建议，其目的在改进劳动的组织工作，使烦重的工作机械化，改良技术过程，改善对工人与职员的文化与生活的服务。这种建议达几十万件，其中许多在公众的帮助下很快地便付诸实现了。
    职工会会员的广大群众讨论并决定自己的工作与生活的根本问题，乃是一件巨大的教育工作。
    日丹诺夫同志在联共（布）党第十八次代表大会的报告中说，职工会“对其会员进行教育工作的结果，应该将职工会会员的水平提高到了解共产主义先锋队的任务的水平，也就是说，到有党性的水平；并为其优秀的会员入党而进行准备工作”。
    目前，当苏联人民向其伟大目标——共产主义胜利地前进的时候，职工会的组织任务与教育任务更增大了。现在，在群众的社会积极性空前高涨、其创造性与自动性空前增长的条件下，必需改进职工会的一切工作。各共和国、边疆区与州成立职工会会议，将可促进职工会工作的改进。根据全苏职工会中央委员会第十九次全会的决定，职工会会议由职工会代表会议选出，其任务是实行职工会之间的措施与配合职工会组织的共同行动，以便展开社会主义竞赛，以求各企业完成并超过国家计划，及更进一步改进工人与职员的物质生活与文化生活。职工会会议应该总结并传播职工会工作的经验，领导职工会之间的文化机关与体育机关。
    各地职工会组织的努力的相互配合，将提高职工会组织的作用和巩固其活动。
    职工会在组织上的指导原则是民主集中制
    苏联的职工会及其各机关——从车间委员会、工厂委员会到中央委员会和全苏职工会中央委员会，是在真正民主的基础上建立起来的。我们的职工会在组织上的指导原则，乃是民主集中制。民主集中制规定职工会自下而上的一切领导机关都必须由选举产生。职工会的车间委员会与工厂委员会、州委员会、共和国委员会、中央委员会以及全苏职工会中央委员会，都是用不记名投票（秘密投票）的方式选出的。每一个委员会都有一定的任期。车间委员会与工厂委员会的全权任期规定为一年。
    民主集中制意味着职工会的一切机关都有义务对其选民作定期的汇报。车间委员会与工厂委员会每半年至少应该对职工会会员作一次汇报，说明自己的活动、已完成的工作及职工会的开支。
    民主集中制的意义也是少数服从多数及下级机关服从上级机关的决定。职工会的一切组织在决定地方性的问题上都是独立自主的，当然，只要其决议不与上级的职工会机关的决定抵触。
    斯大林同志在一九三七年联共（布）党中央委员会全会的闭会词中说：“非党的群众经过非党的积极分子和各种群众会议来考验自己的经济领导者、职工会领导者及其他领导者。非党的群众在群众会议上倾听自己的领导者的汇报，批评缺点并指出矫正缺点的道路。”
    苏联的职工会实践了斯大林同志的这些最重要的指示。职工会机关所进行的举行汇报与选举会议运动，更巩固了职工会的民主。
    开会法定人数的规定，乃是职工会民主最重要的要求之一。只是在职工会会员至少三分之二出席汇报与选举会议的情况下，会议才有法律效力。
    社会主义民主最重要的特色，乃是进行布尔什维克式的批评与自我批评。职工会会员批评大小领导者的活动，要求去掉缺点与改进工作。批评乃是职工会会员不可缺少的权利，是我们民主组织的原则之一。批评与自我批评，并不是偶而举行一次的运动。批评与自我批评在组织上成了苏联职工会的工作，当了使工作不断前进的经常刺激。
    工厂委员会向职工会会员作汇报并受其监督
    车间委员会与工厂委员会向职工会会员有系统地作汇报，乃是职工会民主的不可摧毁的法律。
    工厂委员会向选民汇报它怎样履行了其义务，怎样动员了集体去完成政治任务与经济任务。它汇报履行集体合同，实行职工会会员对合同所提出的建议，执行生产计划与社会主义义务等项工作的情况。它也汇报在集体中进行组织工作与群众工作和对车间委员会与职工会组织者进行领导的情况，及职工会预算中的开支。它并向群众大会报告集体的生产、工资与劳动生产率、社会保险、发展园艺、工人的文化与生活等情况。职工会组织的主人——会员，要求详尽而有自我批评的汇报。
    去年与现在进行选举的结果，先进的人们——在群众中有威信、受尊敬的工人、工程师、技师、领班、职员与文化工作者，选入了工厂委员会与地方委员会的领导机关。那些人中有成万的妇女。在工厂委员会与地方委员会的委员中，百分之四十一点九是妇女。在工厂委员会与地方委员会的主席中，百分之三十六是妇女。一九四八年所通过的党中央委员会关于三八国际妇女节的决议说：“妇女不断增长的社会积极性与政治积极性，乃是社会主义民主的基本特性之一”。
    社会主义民主的同一特性，便是吸引青年参加社会组织的日常工作，当然也参加职工会的工厂委员会、地方委员会与车间委员会的活动。到处都有男女青年工人与共青团领导者被选为工厂委员会与地方委员会委员，和成人平等地决定有关职工会会员的问题。
    工厂委员会在其工作中，依靠大量的积极分子及创造共产主义建设这一伟大事业的群众。
    列宁说：“群众的活生生的创造，便是新的社会性的基本因素”。我们的富有创造性的每一个工作日，都是列宁的这一句伟大的话的鲜明的佐证。
