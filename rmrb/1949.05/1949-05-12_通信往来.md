To comrades in the correspondence network in various regions:

    April and May are the most important seasons in the year for production, and the success of the entire year's agricultural production is largely determined by the sowing work. Most areas have now received welcome rain, which is extremely beneficial to sowing work. We hope everyone will concentrate their efforts and vigorously organize reports on the following aspects:

    (1) How are various regions organizing the masses to extensively carry out crash sowing work? How are the difficulties of the masses being resolved (such as organizing manpower and animal power, regulating seeds, solving problems with farm tools, fertilizers, and livestock, etc.)?

    (2) In rainy areas, how is the practice of taking advantage of drought resistance organizations to sow seeds while the soil is still wet being promoted and utilized?

    (3) How are cadres going deep into the countryside to lead the masses in production and solve the difficulties of the masses?

    通信往来各地通讯员同志：
    四、五两月是一年生产中最重要的季节，而全年农业生产的好坏则大部分决定于播种工作。现大部地区已降喜雨，这对播种工作极为有利，希望大家集中力量，大力地组织这方面的报导：
    （一）各地如何组织群众，广泛地进行突击播种工作？如何解决群众困难（如组织人畜力、调剂种籽、解决农具、肥料、牲畜等之困难）。
    （二）在下雨地区如何推动与利用抗旱组织赶湿下种的情形。
    （三）干部深入乡村领导群众生产，解决群众困难情形。
