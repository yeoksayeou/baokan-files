Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 27th. Three patrol boats and two gunboats of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense's Wuhan patrol fleet, having fled from Yueyang back to Wuhan, have defected to the People's Liberation Army. Before the war criminal Bai Chongxi fled Wuhan, he ordered the eleven ships of the Wuhan Patrol Office, large and small, to flee upstream along the Yangtze River. When these ships fled to the vicinity of Yueyang, the officers and soldiers of patrol boats No. 50, No. 66, and No. 70, and gunboats No. 64 and No. 65, a total of 62 people, deeply felt that the Kuomintang bandit gang had reached its end, and were unwilling to be further subjected to the abuse of the Patrol Office Director Chen Wenhui. Therefore, on the morning of the 18th, under the leadership of soldiers Zhang Shenping, Hu Ying, Cao Xuehai, and others, they killed Chen and sailed back to Wuhan. These five ships safely arrived in Wuchang at about 10:00 AM on the 25th, and were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.

　　由岳阳开回武汉
  　敌舰艇五艘投我
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】国民党国防部武汉巡防舰队的巡逻艇三艘及炮艇两艘，由岳阳逃回武汉，投奔人民解放军。战犯白匪崇禧逃离武汉之前，曾命令武汉巡防处大小十一艘舰艇，向长江上游逃窜。当该舰艇等逃至岳阳附近时，其中巡逻艇五十号、六十六号、七十号三艘，及炮艇六十四号、六十五号两艘的官兵六十二人，因深感国民党匪帮已到穷途末路，且不愿再受该巡防处处长陈文辉的虐待，乃于十八日清晨，在士兵张慎平、胡莹、曹学海等领导下，将该处处长陈某击毙，开回武汉。这五艘舰艇于二十五日上午十时许安全驶抵武昌，受到当地军民的热烈欢迎。
