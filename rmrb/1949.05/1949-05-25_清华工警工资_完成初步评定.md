　　Tsinghua Workers and Police Wages
  　Completed Preliminary Assessment
    [Ping City News] The wage assessment of all 516 workers and police at Tsinghua University has been initially completed. After approval by the Cultural Management Committee, the complete list will be announced to solicit opinions from everyone and make a final decision. The Wage Assessment Committee was established on the 16th, and it was decided to divide workers into three categories: technicians, skilled workers, and general workers. The standards for assessment and scoring are based on three items: technical ability, work attitude, and seniority, but the percentages of these three items differ among the various types of workers. The salary method is cross-progressive (i.e., the highest-paid technician earns far more than the highest-paid general worker, but the latter earns more than the lowest-paid technician). During the assessment, although some workers did not fully understand the meaning of classification and cross-payment, and individual phenomena of egalitarianism, favoritism, and self-interest existed, most workers were serious about the assessment work. The Library Assessment Team did not hold its first meeting well. Su Bingcheng, Wu Changlin, and others who chaired the meeting conducted a strict self-criticism after the meeting, admitted their mistakes to everyone at the second meeting, and accepted criticism. Shen Juxiu from the Pipe Room admitted that he had no skills and should not be considered a technician. Sun Yuying from the Livestock Farm criticized foreman Yu Deshun, saying, "Foreman Yu has good skills, but he doesn't lead everyone to work, which is not right." After the scoring, everyone said, "Everyone's eyes are sharp, who is high and who is low, it's all correct." Many workers received education during the assessment process and improved their understanding of their work. Therefore, after the assessment, the workers' enthusiasm for work has generally increased.

　　清华工警工资
  　完成初步评定
    【平市讯】清华大学全校工警五一六人的工资评定已初步完成，俟文管会同意后，将公布全部名单，征询大家意见，作最后决定。十六日工资评议委员会成立，通过分技工、熟练工、普通工三大类。评议计分的标准是按技术能力、劳动态度、年资三项，但在各类工人中，三者所占百分比不同。给薪办法是交叉累进（即最高技工所得远超过最高普通工人，但后者超过最低技工所得）。评议中，虽有部分工友因对分类交又给薪的意义了解不够，个别的仍有平均主义、讲情面与光顾自己等现象，但一般工友对评议工作都很认真，图书馆评议小组第一次会没有开好，主持会议的苏秉诚、吴昌霖等会后进行了严格的检讨，在第二次会上向大家承认错误，并接受批评。管子室沈举秀承认自己没有技术，不该充技工。畜牧场孙玉瑛批评工头于德顺说：“于头技术好，可是他不领导大家干，就是不对。”评分之后，大家都说：“大伙儿的眼睛是亮的，谁高谁低，一点也不错。”很多工友在评定过程中得到了教育，提高了对工作的认识。所以评议之后，工友们的劳动的积极性普遍提高。
