　　Shanghai Remnant Bandits Are Already Cornered
  　Our Army Occupies Wusong and Baoshan
  　Two Enemy Divisions North of Dachang Surrender
    De'an, Yongxiu, Xingzi, and Tongshan Captured Within Jiangxi and Hubei
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 1400 hours, 26th] The city of Shanghai is nearing complete liberation. The maritime escape route for the Kuomintang bandit troops within the city was closed this morning. The People's Liberation Army, attacking eastward along the Yangtze River north of Shanghai, captured Wusong Town at the mouth of the Huangpu River, Baoshan County seat, and the Shizilin Fort northwest of the city this morning. Gaogiao Town in Pudong, across the Huangpu River from Wusong, has also been captured by the People's Liberation Army. The entire Pudong area has been liberated. Artillery fire from both the east and west banks of the Huangpu River has blockaded the river. The People's Liberation Army, which crossed the Huangpu River from Xujiahui in the southwest of Shanghai and Zhoupu in Pudong to attack the city, has completely liberated the area south of the Suzhou Creek. Zhenru, Dachang, and Jiangwan, north of the Suzhou Creek, have also been captured by another route of the People's Liberation Army. The enemy's defense system has been completely disrupted, and the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops within the city are being annihilated individually.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 1600 hours, 26th] The Kuomintang army in Shanghai, whose land and sea escape routes have been completely cut off, is being annihilated separately. Two entire divisions and remnants of two divisions have surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army, which entered the city, crushed the enemy's deep fortification positions from the evening of the 25th to the morning of the 26th. It captured important enemy strongholds such as Zhenru, Jiangwan, and Dachang on the Jinghu Railway. In the battle to capture Zhenru on the evening of the 25th, the People's Liberation Army annihilated a regiment of the enemy's 123rd Army. The two division headquarters of the 182nd and 308th Divisions of the army, leading the remnants and a part of the traffic police, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army at 9:00 a.m. on the 26th. At dawn on the 26th, the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory and captured Jiangwan in one fell swoop, capturing about 5,000 Kuomintang soldiers from the 54th and 37th Armies, and seizing many tanks and vehicles. Now, the entire defense system of the enemy in the area north of the Suzhou Creek has been completely disrupted, and the enemy is in chaos.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Front, 26th] War criminal Tang Enbo's strict orders to supervise the battle could not stop the vast number of officers and soldiers in the middle and lower ranks of the Kuomintang army in Shanghai from seeking their own liberation. Bandit Tang ordered his political work offices, intelligence groups, and military police and other special service organizations to closely monitor the various departments, and forced officers and soldiers at all levels to implement so-called "vertical and horizontal joint responsibility" between superiors and subordinates and between colleagues. A supervisory organization was set up from the army down to each squad. These supervisors had the power of life and death. The 52nd Army of the bandits also forced officers above the rank of captain to "write a will" and "swear to fight to the death." But these measures could not save the collapse of the Kuomintang army in Shanghai. In the battle to liberate Yuepu, when the People's Liberation Army approached the bunker and shouted to them, the first company of the 888th Regiment of the 269th Division of the bandit's 52nd Army laid down their weapons by platoon and squad. More than half of the third and ninth companies of the same regiment were captured by the People's Liberation Army. The battalion commander of the third battalion and the company commander of the ninth company, He Oubo, surrendered first. They had all written "wills" and sworn oaths. After being liberated, they all said: "Wasn't that just for show! Anyway, it's superiors deceiving subordinates and subordinates deceiving superiors, just trying to get through the day." Jin Po, the deputy company commander of the 9th company of the 887th Regiment, who also served as a bandit supervisor, had packed his bags and brought his own bowls and chopsticks before being captured. He said: "I was afraid that it would be difficult to find bowls and chopsticks in the front line after liberation, so I prepared them myself."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th] The People's Liberation Army, advancing south along the Nanxun Road, occupied the three county towns of De'an, Yongxiu, and Xingzi, east of the Nanxun Road, on the 23rd and 24th, capturing more than 100 members of the Xingzi pseudo-self-defense force. In addition, the Liberation Army, advancing south from southeastern Hubei, occupied Tongshan County, on the border of Hubei and Jiangxi, on the 22nd. The defending enemy, the 3rd Security Brigade of Hubei, fled southwest. The People's Liberation Army pursued and annihilated part of it at Baini Bridge between Tongshan and Chongyang.

　　上海残匪已成瓮中之鳖
  　我军攻占吴淞宝山
  　大场北敌两师投降
    赣鄂境内克德安永修星子通山
    【新华社上海前线二十六日十四时电】上海市已接近全部解放。市区内的国民党匪军的海上逃路，已于今日早晨被封闭。上海北面沿长江向东攻击的人民解放军，于今日早晨攻占黄浦江口的吴淞镇、宝山县城和该城西北的狮子林炮台。  吴淞对岸浦东的高桥镇也已经被解放军攻克。浦东全境已告解放。解放军东西两岸的炮火已经封锁了黄浦江。从上海市西南徐家汇和浦东周浦方面强渡黄浦江攻入市区的解放军，已经完全解放苏州河以南地区。苏州河以北的真茹、大场、江湾，也已经被另一路解放军攻占，敌人防御体系已经被完全打乱，现在市区内的残余国民党匪军，正被个别围歼中。
    【新华社上海前线二十六日十六时电】陆海逃路已被完全切断的上海国民党军，正被分别围歼，并已有两个整师和两个师残部向人民解放军缴械投降。进入市区的人民解放军在二十五日晚到二十六日早晨粉碎敌纵深工事阵地。攻占京沪线上的真茹、江湾和大场等敌重要据点。在二十五日晚上攻占真茹的战斗中，解放军歼灭敌一百二十三军的一个团，该军一百八十二师、三百零八师两个师部率领残部及交通警察一部在二十六日上午九时向解放军投降。廿六日拂晓，解放军攻占大场时，困守大场以北李家楼以南地区的国民党廿一军军部率该军一百四十五师、一百四十六师两个师全部投降。廿六日六时解放军复乘胜一举攻占江湾，活捉国民党军五十四军、三十七军等部约五千多人，缴获坦克、汽车很多。现在苏州河以北地区的敌军整个防御体系已经被完全打乱，敌军混乱不堪。
    【新华社上海前线二十六日电】战犯汤恩伯严厉的督战命令，阻止不了上海国民党军中下层广大官兵的自求解放。汤匪曾命令其政工处、谍报组和宪兵队等特务组织严密监视各部，并强迫各级官兵，于上下级及同级相互之间，实行所谓“纵横连坐”，从军到每个班都设了督战组织。这些督战人员具有生杀予夺之权。匪军第五十二军并强迫尉级以上的军官“写遗嘱一份”，“宣誓要死战到底”。但这些办法，丝毫不能挽回上海国民党军的崩溃。在解放月浦的战斗中，当解放军逼近碉堡进行喊话时，匪五十二军二六九师八八八团第一连便整排整班放下武器。同团第三、第九两连被解放军俘虏的在一半以上。该团第三营营长何鸥波及九连连长并首先投降。他们都是曾经写过“遗嘱”、宣过“誓”的。他们被解放后都说：“那还不是做做样子的！反正是上骗下，下骗上，混过一天算一天。”曾兼任匪督战官的八八七团九连副连长金魄，在被俘前就将包裹打好，并带着自己的碗筷。他说：“我怕解放过来，在前方一时不易找到碗筷，所以自己准备好了。”
    【新华社南昌二十七日电】沿南浔路南下的人民解放军，于二十三、二十四两日，进占德安、永修及南浔路东侧的星子等三座县城，俘星子伪自卫队百余。另由鄂东南南下的解放军，二十二日占领鄂赣交界的通山县城。守敌湖北保安第三旅，往西南逃窜，解放军在通山、崇阳间的白霓桥，追获并歼灭其一部。
