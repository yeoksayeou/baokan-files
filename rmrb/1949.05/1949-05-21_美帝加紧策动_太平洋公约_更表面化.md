　　U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Plotting
  　“Pacific Pact” Becomes More Overt
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th] The activities of U.S. and British imperialism and their vassal states regarding the conclusion of a Pacific aggression pact have become increasingly overt. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Chifley stated on the 15th: "The plan for a Pacific Pact is progressing in parallel with the North Atlantic Treaty plan." A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 14th stated that Kuomintang bandit gang's ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, and ambassadors from non-Australian countries to the United States recently suggested to Acheson the conclusion of an "Eastern Countries Alliance." The U.S. official response to their suggestion was: "If Asian countries agree on the need to establish a Pacific Pact and can achieve the initial economic cooperation deemed necessary by the U.S. government, the United States will consider providing practical assistance to Asian countries with sympathy."
    Note: The "Pacific Pact" aggression plan plotted by U.S. and British imperialism has been brewing for some time. The New Delhi Conference not long ago, as well as the "China (Chiang), Japan, Korea (Syngman Rhee) Anti-Communist Alliance" plan, which was instigated by Kennan, Chairman of the State Department Policy Planning Committee, at the end of last year and enthusiastically pursued by the Kuomintang bandit leaders, are both manifestations of this conspiracy. However, this new aggression plan will inevitably be shattered by the united strength of the Chinese and Eastern countries' people. The U.S. imperialists also see this point. The aforementioned UPI dispatch admits that U.S. officials "express extreme doubt as to whether the situation permits the conclusion of a Pacific Pact in the near future, because the instability of many Asian countries (referring to the strength of the people's forces and the instability of reactionary rule) will negate the possibility of establishing a broad and effective alliance."

　　美帝加紧策动
  　“太平洋公约”更表面化
    【新华社北平十八日电】美英帝国主义及其附庸国关于缔结太平洋侵略公约的活动，已日益表面化，据美联社堪培拉消息，澳总理齐佛莱于十五日称：“太平洋公约的计划，正与北大西洋公约的平行计划同时并进。”合众社华盛顿十四日消息则称，国民党匪帮驻美大使顾维钧及非澳等国驻美大使最近都曾向艾奇逊建议缔结“东方国家联盟”。美国官方对他们的指示是：“如果亚洲各国同意有订立太平洋公约的需要，并能实现美国政府认为必要的初步经济合作，则美国将以同情态度，考虑予亚洲各国以一种实际的援助”。
    按：美英帝国主义所策动的“太平洋公约”侵略计划已酝酿多时。不久以前的新德里会议，以及去年年底，美国务院政策计划委员会主席凯南所策动并为国民党匪首所热中的“中（蒋）、日、韩（李承晚）反共同盟”计划，都是这个阴谋的表现。但这种新的侵略计划，必将为中国和东方各国人民的联合力量所粉碎。对于这点，美帝国主义者也是看到的。上述合众社电讯承认，美官方人士“对于情况是否许可于最近将来缔结太平洋公约，极表怀疑。因为许多亚洲国家的不稳定（按指人民力量强大，反动统治的不稳定），将否定缔结广乏而有效的联盟的可能性。”
