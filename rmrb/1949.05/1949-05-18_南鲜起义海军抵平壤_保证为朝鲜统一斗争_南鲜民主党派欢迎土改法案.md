Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th -- Pyongyang Radio broadcast: South Korean democratic parties welcome the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Korean People's Democratic Republic to establish a committee to draft a land reform law for the south of the republic. The Central Committee of the People's Republican Party issued a statement pointing out: The people of the south of the republic especially welcome this decision. North Korea has implemented land reform, the feudal land tenancy system no longer exists, the countryside is rapidly developing, and the peasants are living a happy life. Conversely, in South Korea under the rule of American imperialism and reactionaries, peasants are enslaved by feudal landlords just as they were under Japanese rule, and therefore they are fighting for land reform. The Central Committee of the Progressive Party pointed out in its statement: This decision is a major step towards liberating the people of the south of the republic from the oppression of the Syngman Rhee pseudo-government. It completely accords with the will and hope of the people, and the Progressive Party is determined to fully support it.

    南鲜民主党派欢迎土改法案
    【新华社北平十六日电】据平壤电台称：起义反抗李承晚傀儡政府的一艘军舰的全体海军人员，在率舰驶抵元山港后，即于十三日乘火车到达平壤。并受到热烈的欢迎。金恩秀（译音）代表平壤市人民委员会向起义的海军人员致敬。海军官兵们表示保证尽力为朝鲜的统一而斗争。
    【新华社北平十六日电】平壤电台广播：南朝鲜民主党派欢迎朝鲜人民民主共和国部长会议关于设立委员会起草共和国南部土地改革法的决定。人民共和党中央委员会发表声明指出：共和国南部的人民特别欢迎这一决定。北朝鲜已实行了土地改革，封建的土地租佃制度已不复存在，农村迅速发展，农民已过着幸福的生活。相反地，在美帝国主义与反动派统治下的南朝鲜，农民则象在日本统治下一样受着封建地主的奴役，因此他们正为土地改革而斗争。进步党中央委员会在其声明中指出：这个决定是从李承晚伪政府的压迫下解放共和国南部人民的一个重大步骤，完全符合于人民的意志与希望，进步党决全力支持它。
