Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 21st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today issued a statement protesting the British imperialists' execution of Ganapathy, leader of the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions. The statement said:

　　From dispatches from London and Kuala Lumpur, we have learned that Ganapathy, Chairman of the All-Malaya Federation of Trade Unions, was hanged by the British imperial authorities in Malaya on May 4th. We express our great anger and grief and lodge a strong protest with the British imperialists in Malaya. Ganapathy was an Indian expatriate who led the six to seven hundred thousand Indian workers in Malaya to organize into a general trade union that symbolizes the unity of the three major ethnic groups—Malay, Overseas Chinese, and Indian—proletariat. He deeply understood all the suffering of the people of the three major ethnic groups in Malaya under the long-term rule of British imperialism. Therefore, he resolutely, bravely, and tirelessly led the laboring people of Malaya in their struggle for independence and liberation. He won the love of the working class of all ethnic groups and became the leader of the entire Malayan working class. Unfortunately, he was persecuted by British imperialism. Ganapathy's death was for the liberation of all oppressed working people in Malaya. Undoubtedly, it will further arouse the tide of liberation among the Malayan people, and the barbaric rule of British imperialism in Malaya will inevitably meet with even more fierce resistance from the Malayan people.

　　英帝惨杀加纳帕西
  　我全国总工会严重抗议
    指出必将遭到人民更猛烈的反抗
    【新华社北平二十一日电】中华全国总工会今日发表声明，抗议英帝绞杀全马来亚职工联合会领袖加纳帕西。声明称：
    从伦敦和吉隆坡两地的电讯，得悉全马来亚职工联合会主席加纳帕西，于五月四日被马来亚英帝当局绞杀，我们表示极大的愤怒和悲痛，并向马来亚英帝国主义提出严重抗议。加纳帕西是印度侨民，他领导马来亚的六、七十万印籍工人，组织到标志三大民族——马来、华侨、印度——无产阶级团结一致的总工会里。他深切知道马来亚三大民族人民在英帝国主义长期统治下，所受到的一切苦难，所以他坚决勇敢、不知疲倦地领导马来亚劳动人民进行独立解放的斗争。他获得各民族工人阶级的爱戴，成为全马来亚工人阶级的领袖。不幸竟遭英帝国主义所迫害——加纳帕西的死，是为了马来亚一切被压迫的劳动人民的解放而死的。无疑地将更激起马来亚人民的解放怒潮，英帝国主义在马来亚的野蛮统治，必将遭到马来亚人民更猛烈的反抗。
