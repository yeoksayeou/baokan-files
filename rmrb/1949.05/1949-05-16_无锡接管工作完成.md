Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 15th: The Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army in Wuxi City completed the takeover of Kuomintang government agencies and various bureaucratic capitalist enterprises in three days. During the takeover, due to the Military Control Commission's correct implementation of the principles of "keeping everything intact, following the system, from top to bottom, and taking over as a whole," as well as the influence of the correct policy implementation in cities like Pingjin (Peiping and Tianjin), the original staff and workers of each department generally stayed at their posts to conduct the handover. The staff, workers, and bailiffs of the pseudo local court's procuratorate, detention center, and prison had already organized a "Contingency Committee" before the liberation to guard assets and preserve weapons, documents, archives, and other items. The director and staff of the public library also preserved more than 100,000 books and all equipment intact. All twenty-five staff members of the pseudo county government's education bureau, from the director down, remained at their posts and immediately organized documents, archives, and books to await takeover after liberation.
