Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS, Moscow: The Institute of Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently held a meeting to discuss issues such as the state and law of the Eastern European People's Democratic States. Several scientists presented theoretical research reports and reports summarizing the working experience of the Eastern European regimes at the meeting. Regarding the social nature of the Eastern European People's Democratic States, a special report pointed out that the Eastern European People's Democratic States are a new form of the dictatorship of the proletariat resulting from the victory over fascism during World War II. The scientists also provided detailed explanations of the basic economic reforms of the People's Democratic States. Due to the nationalization of large-scale industry and landlord land, the socialist part of the national economy in the People's Democratic States has developed rapidly. All People's Democratic States completed land reform in 1948, promoting the democratic construction and political and economic progress of rural areas. Agricultural production cooperatives have also greatly developed. A large amount of farmers' land is now cultivated by state-owned machine and tractor stations. The national economies of the People's Democratic States are now based on the principle of planning. The industrial production of countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria has now greatly exceeded pre-war levels. A report on the legislative reform of the People's Democratic States pointed out that the social reforms carried out in these countries have brought about fundamental changes in the legal and state systems. The new laws passed by the People's Democratic States reflect new legislation in the areas of administration, civil affairs, labor, land, kinship, criminal justice, and judiciary.
