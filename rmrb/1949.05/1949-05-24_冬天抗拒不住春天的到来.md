Winter Cannot Resist the Arrival of Spring
    From the London Foreign Ministers Conference in 1947 to the upcoming Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, the development of the international situation in the past year and a half has demonstrated a truth: Winter cannot resist the arrival of Spring! The US imperialism follows the path of aggression and expansion, from joining forces with the Ruhr financial groups to announcing the "Ruhr Occupation Statute," from gathering the leaders of West German reactionary parties to announcing the "Bonn Constitution," from the "Western European Military Alliance" to the drafting of the North Atlantic Aggression Treaty, these are all records of imperialist aggression; however, every act of aggression by the US imperialism has simultaneously aroused resistance from the forces of peace and democracy. The convocation of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace in Paris and Prague demonstrated the unparalleled power of the people. The ruling classes of Britain and the United States felt an irresistible pressure for peace, and had to bow to the forces of peace, resulting in the agreement to cancel inter-zonal restrictions between East and West Germany and to convene the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. However, the US and British imperialism are still engaged in conspiracies, such as the US-British-French talks on the eve of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Therefore, winning lasting peace is not "smooth sailing," but still requires overcoming all resistance actions through persistent struggle for peace.

　　冬天抗拒不住春天的到来
    从一九四七年的伦敦外长会议到即将召开的巴黎外长会议，一年半时间内，国际局势的发展说明了一个真理：冬天抗拒不住春天的到来！美帝循着侵略扩张路线，从与鲁尔的财阀合流起，到公布“鲁尔占领法规”，从纠集西德反动政党首领到公布“波恩宪法”，自“西欧军事联盟”到北大西洋侵略公约的拟定，这都是帝国主义的侵略罪行录；然而，美帝的每一次侵略行动都同时引起了和平民主力量的抗击。到了巴黎和布拉格世界拥护和平大会的召开，显示了人民的无比威力，美英的统治阶级更感到了不可抗拒的和平压力，才不得不向和平力量低头，而有取消东西德区际限制和召开巴黎四外长会议的协议，但美英帝国主义仍在阴谋活动，如外长会议前夕的美英法会谈等。因之持久和平的赢得，并不是“一帆风顺”，而是仍须以坚持和平的斗争来克服一切抵制行动的。
