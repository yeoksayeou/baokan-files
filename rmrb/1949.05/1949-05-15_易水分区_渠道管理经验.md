Yi County District
Canal Management Experience

The beach canals along the Tang River in Tang County, Yi County District, suffered from a lack of unified organization and leadership in the past. Each canal and beach freely used water, and due to the influence of old feudal habits, unfair water usage events and disputes constantly occurred, with upstream blocking downstream and upper dams blocking lower dams. Last year, after a year of rectification, the Tang River Beach Management Committee was organized to manage the silt deposition in a planned and unified manner. As a result, unprecedented success was achieved in balancing silt deposition of three to four finger depths on more than 40 beaches along the Tang River, covering over 20,000 mu of land. In the past year, Tang County organized irrigation in four ways along the river: First, concentrated irrigation by dividing dams and sections: the irrigation date for each section was determined, water was transferred and connected for irrigation, and each beach household worked together to irrigate their own land. This method can save water when water is scarce, but it is not as labor-saving as organizing specialized personnel for irrigation because each beach household irrigates their own land separately. The second method is sequential irrigation: each household in each canal irrigates in sequence from top to bottom or from bottom to top, each household irrigating their own land. However, because there was no regulation of the rotation time, each irrigation household was often affected and wasted labor. The third method is to organize labor and assign specialized personnel to be responsible for irrigation. Sometimes, several specialized personnel were temporarily assigned from the entire beach to be responsible for irrigation; sometimes, beach households were divided into groups according to distance, and each group took turns sending a certain number of people to be responsible for the irrigation of the entire beach. Labor could be exchanged within the group. Because silt deposition requires certain techniques, those who provided labor were given more work points. This method saves labor and irrigates evenly, making it the best method. It is better to use it in combination with the first method when water is insufficient. The fourth method is contracting irrigation: small beaches do not require much effort, so one person contracts to be responsible for irrigating the entire beach and is given a certain remuneration each year. Among the above four methods, the third one is the most effective and is the main method promoted by the Tang River Beach Management Committee. When this method was first tried in Xiyuekou Village, it encountered some difficulties and failed. At that time, the upstream water users were accustomed to using water freely and were unwilling to give up their past "privileges" and interfered. In addition, the downstream households had no organization in the past and did not dare to actively break the past unreasonable phenomena; the leadership was not in-depth and lacked persistence and methods, so it did not work at the beginning. Later, after mobilization and discussion, the organization of the Beach Management Committee was first strengthened, and land household groups were established (12 groups, each with 10 to 12 people), with a group leader and deputy group leader each responsible for assigning and leading work, and checking water usage. Each time irrigation was carried out, labor was assigned to each group leader according to the labor needs of the entire beach, and each group took turns to work and was responsible for the entire irrigation, and then the accounts were settled regularly. Experienced groups were selected to perform silt deposition to ensure fair water usage and even silt deposition. In addition, the beach members' congress also stipulated beach regulations for everyone to abide by. After this organization, a total of three to four thousand workdays were saved in three months.

    易水分区
    渠道管理经验
    易水分区唐县唐河沿岸的滩渠，由于过去缺乏统一的组织领导，各渠滩随便自由使水，以及旧有封建恶习的影响，以致不断发生上游卡下游、上坝卡下坝使水不公平的事件和纠纷。去年经过一年的整顿，由于滩渠组织了唐河滩地管理委员会，有计划的统一管理了放淤，因此，在唐河沿岸四十多个滩地两万多亩地上，获得了平衡放淤三、四指泥的空前成绩。过去一年中，唐县沿岸组织使水浇地的办法共有四种：第一种是分坝分段集中灌溉：决定每段灌溉日期，输流接浇，各滩户一齐活动，各浇各的。这种办法，在水量缺乏时，集中浇地可以节省水量，不过各滩户一齐各浇各的，就不如组织起来由专人灌溉节省人力。第二种是按次序顺水浇法：每渠各户由上而下或由下而上，按次序输流灌溉，各户浇各户的。但因没有规定轮流浇的时间，各浇户往往受影响，而且浪费劳力。第三种是组织劳力派专人负责浇地。有时是全滩临时派几个专人负责浇地；有的是将滩户按距离远近划成小组，各小组轮流派一定的人负责全滩的灌溉，小组之内可拨工换工。因放淤时须一定技术，所以给出工的人多顶工。这种办法既节省人力，浇地又均匀，是最好的一种办法。在水量不足时，和第一种办法结合使用更好。第四种是包工浇地办法：小的滩地不须要大的工夫，由一人包起来负责浇全滩的地，每年给予一定报酬。以上四种办法以第三种收效最好，是唐河滩地管理委员会主要推行的办法。这种办法开始在西岳口村试行时，曾碰到一些困难而失败了，当时因上游使水户随便使水惯了，不愿放弃过去的“特权”从中阻扰，再加上下游户过去没有组织，不敢积极打破过去不合理现象；领导又不深入缺乏坚持性和办法，所以开始没有行通。后来经过动员、讨论，首先把滩地管理委员会的组织健全起来，并建立了地户小组（十二组，每组十人至十二人），每组设正副组长各一人，负责派工领工、检查使水。每次浇地时，按全滩需工向各组长派工，各组轮流出工负责整工浇地，然后定期结帐齐工，在小组内拨工还工。到放淤时推出有经验的小组担任，做到公平使水放淤均匀。另外还由滩员大会规定了滩约，大家遵守。这样组织后，三个月期间，共省工三、四千个。
