　　North China Elementary Education Conference
　　Typical Reports Today
　　[Our Dispatch] The North China Elementary Education Conference has been discussing and studying the draft of the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Elementary Education in the North China Region" and the draft of the "Provisional Regulations on Service for Elementary School Teachers in the North China Region" for several days. After group and plenary discussions, opinions have been concentrated, and the presidium is conducting in-depth research for revisions. It is scheduled to hold typical reports on elementary education work in various regions today (the 28th). When the plenary session discussed the draft implementation measures on the 25th, guests from Peking University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Yenching University, the Higher Education Committee, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Primary School affiliated to the Teachers College attended. All groups fully agreed with the basic spirit of the draft, believing that it not only summarized the experience of twelve years of New Democratic education work in the liberated areas, but also stipulated unified and flexible methods and systems based on the needs of future construction. Everyone attached particular importance to the guiding principles and teaching work, and put forward positive opinions on how to make them more clear and appropriate, with lively discussions. Other issues, such as the school system, curriculum and teaching time, organizational structure meetings, and the establishment of leadership, were also supplemented and revised based on the actual conditions of their respective regions. On the 26th and 27th, the groups conducted research on the draft provisional regulations on service for elementary school teachers, and conducted serious discussions on items such as general principles, qualifications, appointment and removal transfers, treatment, study and further education, and performance evaluation rewards and punishments. The groups believed that the formulation of these service regulations is of great significance for encouraging the professional spirit of elementary school teachers, improving the quality of teachers, and raising education work to a higher level. Everyone attached great importance to the learning of elementary school teachers. Some suggested that, in addition to strengthening specific leadership in the future, elementary school teachers themselves should regard it as their own task, so as to do their work better; the quality of learning should be used as one of the conditions for evaluating performance. In addition, issues such as determining the conditions for teacher qualifications, dividing grades, whether to be mainly hired by villages or dispatched by county committees, political treatment, and conditions for rewards and punishments were also discussed in depth.

　　华北小学教育会议
  　今日典型报告
    【本报讯】华北小学教育会议连日讨论研究华北区小学教育暂行实施办法草案与华北区小学教师服务暂行规程草案，经小组与大会讨论，已将意见集中，主席团正深入研究，以便修正。预定今日（二十八日）举行各地区小学教育工作的典型报告。二十五日大会讨论实施办法草案时，并有北大、辅大、燕大、高等教育委员会、青年团中央及师大附小等来宾列席参加。各组对草案的基本精神完全同意，认为这草案不仅总结了十二年解放区新民主主义教育工作的经验，而且根据今后建设需要，规定了统一而又灵活的办法与制度。大家特别重视方针与教导工作两部分，对如何订得更明确适当，提出了积极意见，讨论很热烈。其他如学制、课程及教学时间、组织编制会议、设置领导等问题，也根据自己区域的实际情况，提出补充与修正意见。二十六、二十七两日，各组进行研究小学教师服务暂行规程草案，对总则、资格、任免调动、待遇、学习进修、考绩奖惩等项作了郑重讨论。各组认为这一服务规程的拟定，对鼓励小学教师专业精神，提高师资质量，把教育工作提高一步有极大意义。大家对小学教师学习问题极为重视，有的提出今后领导上除应加强具体领导外，小学教师本人应把它作为自己的任务，以便把工作做得更好；学习的好坏，应做为考核成绩条件之一。此外，对确定教员资格的条件、划分等级、主要由村聘任或由县委派、政治待遇、奖惩条件等问题，亦都加以深入讨论。
