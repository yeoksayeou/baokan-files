    The Title of Communist Party Member is Supremely Noble
    By Bu Luowarski
    Translated by Gao Shikun
    The Bolshevik Party pays close attention to its own organizational composition. The Party constantly concerns itself with only absorbing the advanced, the excellent, and those who have been examined into the Party. The characteristic of the Party's organizational principle is that it does not passively observe changes in its organizational composition, but rather guides and rectifies the development of its ranks, and conducts systematic Bolshevik education for Communist Party members.

    "Why does the Party rectify its own organizational composition?" Comrade Stalin explained, "Because the Party understands that the organizational composition directly affects the Party's work" (Stalin's Selected Works, Vol. 6, Russian Edition, p. 66).

    Lenin and Stalin taught us: "The strength of the Communist Party lies not only in quantity, but primarily in the quality of its members and their political consciousness." This principle was followed when the Party was only formed of scattered groups and cells, during the period of struggle to establish a Marxist party in Russia. Now that the ranks of Lenin and Stalin's great Party have more than six million members and lead the world's first socialist country, this principle is still fully applicable today.

    The Party repeatedly reminds its organizations at all levels that they must adopt a cautious and vigilant attitude towards the recruitment of new members. 1919 was the most difficult and intense period of the civil war, when the White bandit armies of Denikin and Yudenich directly threatened Moscow and Petrograd. The progressive workers and peasants who joined the Party during "Membership Recruitment Week" clearly saw these dangers and difficulties, which were closely linked to the title of every Communist Party member. Lenin wrote at the time: Our Party is "the only ruling party in the world that is concerned not with increasing the number of its members, but with improving the quality of its members" (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 14, Russian Edition, p. 484). Comrade Stalin strongly emphasized that the principle derived from experience must be followed in the issue of recruiting new members: "Quality first, then quantity" (Stalin's Selected Works, Vol. 5, Russian Edition, p. 72).

    According to these instructions of Lenin and Stalin and in adaptation to the new situation, the Party changed the conditions for recruiting members. In order to rectify its organizational composition, it implemented some necessary measures: stipulating a probationary period, carrying out large-scale and partial purges, reviewing Party membership cards, and temporarily suspending the recruitment of new members. In 1922, after the implementation of the New Economic Policy, the Party's Eleventh Congress stipulated the principle of recruiting members based on their social background.

    Due to the victory of socialism, the elimination of capitalist elements, and the unity of Soviet socio-political thought, the various conditions for joining the Party based on the social status of the applicant are no longer necessary. Therefore, the principle of individually recruiting new members has greater significance. Comrade Stalin, in his report to the Party's Eighteenth Congress, put forward as one of the basic tasks: "To systematically revise the Party Constitution, raise the level of awareness of Party members, and adhere to the principle of only individually selecting and examining comrades who are loyal to the cause of communism."

    The Party constantly concerns itself with ensuring that the growth in the number of Party members must be in line with the consolidation of the Party's quality, which is one of the important organizational principles of the Bolshevik Party in the issue of recruiting members. When the growth in quantity exceeds the improvement in quality, the Party will propose a limited recruitment of new members, and strengthen political education and Bolshevik training of Party members. We remember that, for example, during "Membership Recruitment Week," Lenin pointed out in his letter to the preparatory committee of the Ninth Congress that the Party's new expansion put forward a new task for the Party organization: "To help thoroughly educate these new members, and to cultivate cadres of communist builders from these new members." After Lenin's suggestion, when a large number of advanced workers joined the Party, the task of educating new members on the Leninist foundation was very urgently put forward.

    Comrade Stalin said in a conversation with participants at a propaganda work conference: "The Party's numerical increase has been rapid recently. This is certainly good, because the rapid growth of the Party shows the growth of the working class's trust in our Party. But at the same time, there are some shortcomings here. These shortcomings are that the rapid growth of the Party has, to some extent, lowered the level of awareness of the Party ranks, and has considerably weakened the quality of the Party. And the significance of quality for us should not be less than quantity, if not more than quantity. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we must stop some of our comrades from being excessively obsessed with the Party's numerical growth, we must stop the practice of padding the numbers when recruiting members, and we must stipulate methods so that great efforts are made to select new members in the future. That is one. Secondly, we must organize intensive political study for new members, in order to raise their political awareness to the appropriate level." (Stalin's Selected Works, Vol. 7, Russian Edition, p. 239).

    The rapid growth of our Party during the Great Patriotic War and the post-war period is proof of the Party's high prestige and its connection with the masses. At the same time, a considerable portion of the three million new members who have joined the Party in recent years have not received the political education they deserve in a timely manner, which has created a considerable disparity between the Party's quantity and the political education of its members. Therefore, it is very clear that the Party is now not emphasizing the further growth of its ranks, but rather strengthening the improvement of the political level of its members, and comprehensively improving educational work within the Party.

    This indicates the direction of all practical work that the Party organization is now carrying out in recruiting and educating Party members. The Party is not stipulating any new principles for recruiting members, but rather increasing the sense of responsibility of Party organizations and their leaders in striving for excellence in recruiting members. All practical day-to-day work in recruiting members should be infused with the continuous improvement of the quality and role of Party members.

    The practical work of recruiting members depends on the degree to which the Party organization demands of its members, and how well they understand what kind of people should be recruited into the Party under the current conditions. The increase in the degree of requirements for Party members is not only because great tasks have been put before the Party, but also because the difference between the majority of non-Party masses and Party members is not the same as it was fifteen years ago.

    Our Party has opened up a broad road to development, giving a profound political and ideological influence to the entire working masses. The Party's policies, its tactics, and its slogans have become the banner uniting all the people of the Soviet Union. Party members and non-Party members are united and fighting side by side for communism. A solid relationship of mutual trust has formed between Party members and non-Party members. The Soviet social system has united them into a collective of common friendship among the Soviet people. In the common collective, Party members and non-Party members once fought together to consolidate the strength of our country, once shared hardships and overcame the enemies of our motherland, and are now conducting the struggle to restore and develop the people's economy in the future. Party members and non-Party members are creating a common great cause of communist construction; the goals are the same, the interests are common, and in this sense, the difference between Party members and non-Party members has become a formality, only that some people have joined the Party, and others have not.

    This is a very great achievement of the Party. This shows that the Party has done great work in raising the political awareness of the masses. Precisely because of this, millions of non-Party masses have gradually reached the level of Party members. However, in order to solve the great tasks of communist construction, the Party organization must further strengthen organizational and educational work in all economic and cultural construction departments. Therefore, the requirements for Party members have been raised, and the meaning of the Party member vanguard has been enriched and filled with new content. Today, it is not enough to simply complete the production plan, because the non-Party masses are completing the plan very successfully—Party members should strive to become innovators in production, on the fronts of science and technology, and become initiators and organizers of mass movements in high-level production work in industry and collective farms, and in a solid economic system. Party members are shock troops in socialist competition, strong organizers of mass work in overcoming difficulties and in improving material living conditions and cultural and educational work in industry and collective farms.

    Now, checking the vanguard role of Communist Party members is not only about looking at their attitude towards production work, but also about how they struggle against the capitalist ideas that remain in the consciousness of the Soviet people.

    The prosperity of our socialist economy and culture is accompanied by the continuous growth of the socialist consciousness of the masses. In order for Communist Party members to truly play a vanguard role, they should broaden their horizons further. At present, when our Party is launching an offensive against the capitalist remnants still existing in people's minds, Comrade Stalin's words are particularly incisive and powerful: "If we can cultivate the cadres of all our work departments ideologically and train them politically to such an extent that they can freely determine the direction in the domestic and international environment, if we can train them to become fully mature Marxists-Leninists, who are good at determining the issues of leading the country without serious errors, then we can consider nine-tenths of all our problems to have been solved." The Party recruits those who are most loyal and express their determination to contribute all their strength to their socialist motherland into the Party. But there is such a naive idea that once you join the Party, you immediately shed the heavy burden of yesterday's wrong views and capitalist remnants. In fact, the process of ideological transformation and the Bolshevik training of Party members does not end after joining the Party.

    Carrying out continuous Leninist propaganda within the Party is one of the most important tasks of the Party organization. "Tirelessly striving to raise your level of awareness and striving to grasp the foundations of Marxism-Leninism" is a very important responsibility that the Party Constitution charges Party members with, and the Party requires the establishment of systematic supervision to complete this responsibility.

    No matter where a Party member works, no matter what profession, he should not only be proficient in his own business, but also become an active social-political activist who cares about the fate of his motherland, and do his best to become an active participant in the struggle for the motherland to rapidly move towards a communist society.

    Systematically mastering the science of the laws of social development is an important sign of a Communist Party member's party spirit. No amount of practical work should put aside the completion of this task. The combination of daily work and theoretical study, no matter what difficulties there may be at first, should become a habit and a need for Party members. If he has the will, perseverance, and determination to achieve the established goal, then a true Communist Party member is able to and should successfully master the theory of Marxism-Leninism.

    Of course, the education of Party members is not limited to political education. The work of the Party branch should be done in such a way that every Party member always feels that he is a member of a combative and proactive collective, and that he actively participates in the life of the Party. Correctly organizing various Party meetings, launching criticism and self-criticism, thoughtfully assigning tasks to Party members, and supervising their implementation, all of these are extremely important in cultivating mature Marxists, in cultivating politically sharp and vigilant people, and in cultivating people who are firm, proactive, and down-to-earth in the struggle for the Party's line.

    The Party is raising the requirements for Party members and for everyone who asks to join the Party by strictly checking the depth of Party members' understanding of Stalin's principles, which is: those who join the Party, personal demands must be subordinate to the demands of the organization, personal interests must be dissolved in the interests of the Party, and take on the noble responsibility—to faithfully and self-sacrificingly serve the victory of the cause of communism.

    共产党员的称号是无上崇高的
    布洛瓦尔斯基作

    布尔什维克党对自己本身的组织成份是非常注意的，党经常关心只吸收先进的，优秀的，经过考查的人到党内来。党的组织原则的特色就是她不是消极地观望自己组织成份发生的变化，而是去指导和整顿自己队伍的发展，对共产党员进行有系统的布尔什维克的教育工作。
    “为什么党要整顿自己的组织成份呢？——斯大林同志解释说，——因为党了解组织成份是直接影响党的工作的”（斯大林选集六卷俄文版六十六页）。
    列宁和斯大林教导我们说：“共产党之所以强大不仅是在于数量，而首要的是党员的质量和他们的政治觉悟。”当党还只是由零散的团体和小组形成的时候，布尔什维克为建立俄国的马克思主义的党而斗争的时期，就是遵循着这一原则的。现在当列宁、斯大林的伟大的党底队伍已拥有六百多万党员，并领导着世界上第一个社会主义国家的时候，这一原则仍完全适用于今天。
    党一再地提醒自己的各级组织对于吸收新党员必须采取慎重，警惕的态度。一九一九年是内战最困难和最激烈的时期，当时登尼金和尤登尼奇的白匪军直接威胁了莫斯科和彼得格勒。于“吸收党员周”时入党的进步的工人和农民，清楚地看到了这些危险和困难，是和每一个共产党员的称号密切相关联的。列宁当时写道：我们党是“世界上唯一的执政党，她所关心的不是党员数字的增加，而是党员质量的提高”（列宁全集十四卷俄文版四八四页）。斯大林同志曾极力强调说：在吸收新党员入党问题上必须遵循着经验得来的原则：“先质而后量”（斯大林选集五卷俄文版七十二页）。
    根据列宁和斯大林的这些指示和适应新的情况，党变更了吸收党员的条件，为了整顿自己的组织成份，实行了一些必要的措施：规定候补期，进行大批的和部份的清党，审查党证和暂时停止吸收新党员入党。一九二二年于实行新经济政策后，党的十一次代表大会曾规定了根据社会出身吸收党员的原则。
    由于社会主义的胜利，由于资本主义分子的肃清及苏维埃社会政治思想上的一致，依入党者社会地位而定的各种入党条件，已经是不须要了。因而各别吸收新党员的原则就有更大的意义。斯大林同志在党的十八次代表大会上于报告中作为基本任务之一提出了：“有系统地修改党章，提高党员的觉悟程度和只是个别的选拔审查过的忠实于共产主义事业的同志入党的原则”。
    党经常关心于党的队伍数量的增长一定要符合于党的质量的巩固，是布尔什维克党在吸收党员的问题上重要的组织原则之一。当数量的增长超过了质量的提高时，党就要提出有限制的吸收新党员入党，就要加强政治教育和党员的布尔什维克的锻炼。我们记得，譬如在“吸收党员周”时，列宁给九次代表大会准备会的信中就指出，党的新的扩充就向党的组织提出一个新的任务：“帮助这新党员的彻底的教育，从这些新党员中培养共产主义建设者的干部”。列宁的这个提示以后，当大量的先进的工人入党的时候，就非常迫切地提出了对新党员的列宁主义基础底教育的任务。
    斯大林同志在宣传工作会议上和与会者的谈话中说：“近来党底数量的增加是飞跃的。这当然是好的，因为党的飞速的增长说明了工人阶级对我们党的信任的增长。但同时这里也有一些缺点。这些缺点就是党的飞速的增长使得党的队伍在某种程度上降低了觉悟水平，就相当的削弱了党的质量。而质量的意义对于我们来说如果不多于数量的话，也不应少于数量。为了克服这些缺点，必须制止我们某些同志的过分地醉心于党的数量的增长，必须停止滥竽充数的吸收党员，和规定办法以便今后吸收新党员要大力的选择。这是一。其次，必须组织新党员的紧张的政治学习，以便把他们的政治觉悟提高到应有的水平”。（斯大林选集七卷俄文版二三九页）。
    伟大的祖国战争时间和战后时期的我们党底飞跃的增长，就是党有高度威望和她联系群众的明证。同时近几年来入党的三百万新党员中相当大的一部份还没有及时的受到应有的政治教育，这便在党的数量上与党员底政治教育程度上造成了相当大的悬殊。因此，很显然地，党现在不是强调自己队伍以后的增长，而是加强提高党员的政治水平，全盘的提高党内的教育工作。
    这便指明了现在党的组织在吸收党员和教育党员上进行一切实际工作的方向。现在党不是规定什么新的吸收党员的原则，而是提高党的组织及其领导者在吸收党员上要力求精益求精的责任心。吸收党员底一切实际日常工作应该贯注不断地提高党员的品质和作用。
    吸收党员的实际工作是取决于党的组织对党员所要求的程度，看他们在目前的条件之下对于应该吸收什么样的人入党了解的程度如何。而对于党员要求的程度的增高并不单是因为在党的面前提出了大的任务，而且是因为现在多数的党外群众与党员间的区别已不象十五年前那样了。
    我们党开辟了广大的发展底道路，给予全体劳动群众深刻的政治思想影响。党的政策，党的策略，党的口号已成为团结全苏联人民的旗帜。党与非党团结一致地并肩为共产主义而奋斗。党与非党之间已形成了牢固的互相信任的关系，苏维埃的社会制度把他们结成了一个苏联人的共同友谊的集体。在共同的集体里面，党与非党曾经一同为了巩固我们国家的强大而斗争，曾一同共患难而战胜了我们祖国的敌人，现在则一同进行着争取人民经济底恢复和将来的发展的斗争。党与非党是创造一个共同的共产主义建设的伟大事业；目的是一致的，利益是共同的，在这个意义上来讲，党与非党之间的区别便成了形式，只是一部份人参加了党，而另一部份没有而已。
    这就是党的非常伟大的成绩。这表明了党在提高群众的政治觉悟上做了伟大的工作，正因为这样，千百万的非党群众逐渐地达到了党员的水平。但是要解决共产主义建设底伟大任务，要求党的组织在一切经济和文化建设部门更要加强组织和教育工作。因此就提高了对党员的要求，党员先锋队的含意便丰富和充实了新的内容。今天单只是完成生产计划已经不够了，因为非党群众很有成绩地完成着计划，——党员应该竭力在生产中，在科学和技术的战线上成为革新者，在工业和集体农庄里的高度的生产工作上，在坚固的经济制度上，党员应成为群众运动的发起者和组织者。党员是社会主义竞赛的突击手，在克服困难上以及在工业和集体农庄里的改善物质生活条件和文化教育工作上，是群众工作底坚强的组织者。
    现在检查共产党员底先锋队的作用不只是看他对生产工作的态度，而且还要看他们与苏联人意识中残存的资本主义思想的斗争如何。
    我们的社会主义的经济和文化的繁荣是伴随着群众底社会主义觉悟底不断的增长而来的。而为了共产党员真正地起先锋队的作用，他们应该更扩大一些自己的眼界。目前当我们党向人们意识中尚存的资本主义残余展开攻势的时候，斯大林同志的话是特别精辟有力的：“假如我们能够在思想上培养我们一切工作部门的干部及在政治上锻炼他们到这样的程度，即他们在国内和国际的环境中能够自由地决定方向，假如我们能够造就他们成为完全成熟的马列主义者，善于决定领导国家的问题而没有严重的错误，那么我们就可以认为我们所有问题的十分之九已经是解决了”。党是吸收最忠实的，表示决心把自己的一切力量贡献给自己的社会主义祖国的人入党的。但却有这么一种幼稚的想法，就是一入党便马上去掉了昨天的错误观点的重载和资本主义底残余。其实入党以后思想改造的过程和党员布尔什维克的锻炼并不是从此就完结的。
    在党内进行不断的列宁主义的宣传是党的组织最重要的任务之一。“不倦地努力提高自己的觉悟程度，努力掌握马列主义的基础”，这是党章责成党员们作为他们很重要的责任，党并要求为完成这一责任建立有系统的监督。
    党员无论在什么地方工作，不管什么职业，他不仅应该精通自己的业务，同时还应成为活跃的关心自己祖国命运的社会职业政治家，尽力的成为为祖国迅速奔向共产主义社会而斗争的积极的参加者。
    有系统的掌握社会发展规律的科学是共产党员党性底重要标志。任何实际工作的繁忙也不应该把这个任务的完成置之一旁。日常工作与理论学习的配合，最初不管有任何困难也应成为党员的习惯和需要。假如他有非达既定目的不可的意志，毅力和决心，那末，真正的共产党员是能够而且应该有成绩的掌握马列主义的理论的。
    当然，党员的教育不仅限于政治教育。党的支部工作应该作到这样，即使得每个党员经常感到自己是有战斗性、主动性的集体底一员。使他积极地参加党的生活。正确地组织党的各种会议，展开批评和自我批评，多加考虑的交给党员任务，并监督其执行，所有这些，在培养成熟的马克思主义者，在培养政治上锐敏而警惕的以及在为党的路线的斗争中坚定的，主动而踏实的人材的工作上是极为重要的。
    党是于严格检查党员对斯大林的原则的理解的深度如何而去提高对党员及对每个要求入党的人的要求的，这原则就是：入党的人，个人的要求服从组织的要求，个人利益要溶化于党的利益中，负起崇高的职责——忠实的，自我牺牲的为共产主义事业的胜利而服务。
