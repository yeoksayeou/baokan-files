　　Guangquanxing Distillery
  　Privately Distills Alcohol, Conceals Income
  　Additional Penalty of Twice the Tax Amount
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Southwest Branch of the Ping Municipal Tax Bureau discovered that Guangquanxing Distillery in Changxindian Town had privately distilled 12,395 catties of alcohol. Since the liberation of Changxindian, Guangquanxing Distillery has not ceased its private distilling activities. When the spring business tax was collected this time, Guangquanxing also failed to report the actual amount. It was only discovered after this inspection. Upon learning of this, the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau ordered the Southwest Branch to not only levy 800,675 yuan (calculated at the then ex-factory price of 65 yuan per catty) as a 100% supplementary tax on the 10,000-plus catties of privately distilled alcohol by Guangquanxing Distillery, but also to impose a penalty of twice the tax amount. The Southwest Branch immediately handled the matter in accordance with the regulations upon receiving the notification.
