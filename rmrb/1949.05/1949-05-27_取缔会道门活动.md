    Banning Activities of Secret Societies and Taoist Sects
    Since the North China People's Government issued the order to ban the activities of secret societies and Taoist sects on January 4th, some areas have not only failed to promptly register these organizations with the local government but have continued to engage in open or secret activities. Particularly in newly liberated and semi-old areas where the masses have not been fully mobilized, they spread rumors and engage in deception. Once the masses are misled into joining, they are subjected to control, oppression, and extortion.

    Judging from the organization, activities, or names of these secret societies and Taoist sects, they are extremely reactionary, revivalist, and regressive. Especially at a time when the entire country is achieving victory, these reactionary feudal organizations have been further colluded with and utilized by the Kuomintang bandit gangs as a last-ditch struggle and act of sabotage.

    Secret societies and Taoist sects are reactionary organizations left over from history, and their activities are more prevalent in newly liberated and semi-old areas where the masses have a low level of awareness. Therefore, our cadres, especially those entering newly liberated areas, must pay attention to overcoming phenomena of detachment from the masses in their work and style. Otherwise, bandits, spies, secret societies, and Taoist sects will exploit our weaknesses in work or the impure style of individual cadres to incite the masses. We must not have any sense of complacency regarding secret societies and Taoist sects. We must first eliminate from our own minds any remaining views of their legitimacy, engage in deep and arduous persuasive education of the masses, expose the deceptive conspiracies of secret societies and Taoist sects, understand and solve the sufferings of the masses themselves (such as the prevalence of diseases), and raise the awareness of the masses to achieve the fundamental elimination of secret societies and Taoist sects. We must avoid being satisfied with superficial gains.

    Cadres and the masses in all regions must implement and execute the order of the North China People's Government regarding the banning of activities of secret societies and Taoist sects. First, all secret society organizations must be dissolved, and no further activities are permitted. Second, the leading figures of secret societies and Taoist sects should register; those who resist registration and continue activities will be severely punished. Third, the general members of the masses who were threatened, lured, or deceived into joining secret societies and Taoist sects will not be prosecuted if they withdraw from their organizations and activities. Those who expose bandit and spy schemes and sabotage activities will be rewarded.

    Public security departments in all regions must strengthen their investigation and research into the activities of secret societies and Taoist sects during normal times so that when problems have occurred or may occur, they can maintain a serious and calm attitude and handle the issue quickly, accurately, and with differentiation, to avoid all biases that have occurred or may occur in grasping policy.

### 取缔会道门活动

　　取缔会道门活动
    自华北人民政府于一月四日发布了取缔会门、道门活动的命令后，至今某些地区的会门、道门不但没有迅速向当地政府登记，却续作公开的或秘密的活动；特别在新区半老区群众没有充分发动的地方，进行造谣，欺骗，一旦群众被迷惑入道后，即进行统治、压榨与勒索。
    从会、道门的组织活动或名称上来看，均极端反动复古倒退，特别是在全国胜利的时候，这些反动的封建的组织已更进一步为国民党匪帮勾结利用，以作最后的挣扎与破坏。
    会、道门是历史上遗留下来的反动组织，在新区半老区群众觉悟低的地方活动较为普遍，因之我们干部特别是进入新区的干部，必须注意克服在工作上与作风上脱离群众的现象。否则匪特会道门会利用我们工作上的弱点或个别干部作风不纯来煽惑群众。我们对会、道门切勿存有麻痹思想；必须首先肃清自己思想上对会、道门的保留合法观点，深入而艰苦的说服教育群众，揭露会、道门的欺骗阴谋，了解与解决群众本身的疾苦（如疾病流行等），提高群众的觉悟，以达到从根本上消灭会、道门的目的，切忌满足于形式上的收获。
    各地干部群众必须贯彻与执行华北人民政府关于取缔会门道门活动的命令。一、所有会门组织一律解散，不得再有任何活动。二、会门道门的首要分子应进行登记，抗不登记继续活动者定予严惩。三、所有被威胁诱惑欺骗而参加会、道门的一般会员群众，凡脱离其组织和活动即不予追究，其揭发匪特奸谋与破坏活动者予以奖励。
    各地公安部门平时必须加强对会、道门活动的调查研究，以便在问题已经发生或可能发生时，能够保持严肃冷静的态度，迅速确切而又有区别的处理这一问题，以避免在掌握政策中曾经发生或可能发生的一切偏向。
