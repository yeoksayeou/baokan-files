　　Fire at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
  　Cause of Fire Under Further Investigation
    [Reported by this newspaper] A fire occurred at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant at approximately 4:00 AM on the 25th. The fire originated in the laboratory of the iron smelting plant. After it was discovered, flames were already shooting out of the roof. After a vigorous firefighting effort by the fire brigade and the plant's security team, the fire was completely extinguished at 7:00 AM. The fire consumed two rooms of the iron smelting plant's laboratory, one warehouse, two rooms of the coking plant's laboratory, one warehouse, three rooms of the chemical plant's office and warehouse, and other office rooms, totaling eleven rooms. Most of the equipment, medicines, and instruments were destroyed, with only a small portion salvaged. According to preliminary investigations, the cause of the fire may have been the muffle furnace made by the iron smelting plant's laboratory. The furnace's fire channel was close to the wall, which was made of wood and reeds. When the furnace temperature reached around 1000 degrees, even the steel bricks would turn red. It is natural for the thin layer of lime to easily ignite the reeds and wood inside the wall. However, it is not yet certain whether the cause is that simple, because it is said that there had been fires before liberation without incident. Why is it happening now? According to preliminary investigations by the Public Security Bureau, there are still many suspicious points that require further investigation. However, regardless of the cause, the negligence of the personnel on duty is one of the reasons for this major disaster at the steel plant. When Liu Liang and others from the iron smelting plant's worker-security team saw smoke coming from the roof of the laboratory during their late-night patrol and wanted to enter to rescue, they found that there was no one inside and the door was locked. It turned out that the apprentice worker Zhao Jinji who was watching the furnace had gone to the sampling room to sleep. So they called the fire brigade, but there was no one in the telephone room, so both calls failed. The fire brigade on duty from 3:00 to 4:00 AM also failed to notice the fire. By the time the patrolling worker-security team arrived, the firefighters were still getting dressed. At this critical time of air defense and anti-espionage, the negligence of the personnel on duty and the lack of vigilance and inspection by the administration are serious faults. In addition, the furnace's construction was also a major error, and the plant's supervisor was also responsible for rashly using it without paying attention to its safety. Furthermore, the fire brigade's poor technical skills prevented them from effectively controlling the fire when they arrived at the scene, and their firefighting equipment was also very poor, with only one diesel engine and three hand-operated pumps. It took the diesel engine fifteen to thirty minutes to pump water, and most of the water pipes were leaky. Therefore, the fire started around 3:40 AM, but no water arrived until 4:30 AM, otherwise at least three or four rooms could have been saved, and the losses would not have been so great.

　　石景山钢铁厂发生火警
  　起火原因正作进一步调查
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂于二十五日清晨四时左右发生火警，火源起自炼铁厂化验室，经发觉后火苗已冲出屋顶，经消防队和工厂保卫队队员奋力灌救，延烧至七时才完全熄灭。计焚去炼铁厂化验室两间、库房一间、炼焦厂化验室两间、库房一间，化工厂办公室库房三间，及其他公事房等共十一间。其中设备药品仪器等只抢出一小部分外大多都已焚毁。起火原因据初步调查，可能是炼铁厂化验室自造的马弗炉所引起，因该炉火道紧贴在夹壁上，而夹壁中心是由木板芦苇构成的，当炉温达到一千度左右时，钢砖都要烧红的，何况薄薄一层石灰。自然容易把壁心里的芦苇木板烤着。但原因是否这样单纯尚不敢确定，因为据说解放前也曾烧过，没有出事，为什么现在出事呢？据公安总局初步侦察，认为仍有许多值得怀疑的地方需要作进一步了解。但不论如何，这次钢铁厂起火酿成巨灾，值勤人员的疏忽是原因之一。当炼铁厂工保队后夜巡逻刘梁等看见化验室屋顶冒烟想入内抢救时，竟发现屋内无人，房门紧闭，原来看炉的小工友赵晋吉到取样室睡觉去了。于是他们就打电话给消防队，不料电话室竟也没有人，因此两次电话都没有打通。而消防队三点到四点的值班居然也没有发现火警，等到巡逻的工保队赶到那里，消防队员还正在穿衣起床哩。值此防空防特的紧要时期，值勤人员竟这样疏忽，而行政上也不加警惕检查，实是一严重的过失。此外，该炉子的构造也是个很大的错误，而该厂主管也没有注意到这炉子的安全与否，就冒然加以利用也有责任。再如消防队技术不佳到了火场不知如何才能有效的制止火道，消防设备也很差，只有柴油机一架，腕力机三架。这一架柴油机还得费一刻钟到半点钟才能抽上水来，而且水管大都破陋，因此，三点四十分左右起了火，四点半钟尚未有水到来，否则至少尚可抢救房屋三、四间，不致有如此大的损失。
