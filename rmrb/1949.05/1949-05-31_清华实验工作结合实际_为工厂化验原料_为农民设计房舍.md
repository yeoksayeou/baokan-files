Tsinghua Experiments Combine Theory with Practice
　　Testing Raw Materials for Factories
　　Designing Houses for Farmers

[Our Newspaper] The science and engineering departments of Tsinghua University in Beiping are combining theory with practice, starting to test industrial raw materials for factories. The architecture department has also begun to study farmhouses. The science and engineering departments are currently testing aluminum sent by an aviation agency for manufacturing aircraft: first, the materials testing laboratory of the civil engineering department tests the tensile and compressive strength of the aluminum, and then the chemistry department analyzes the composition of impurities in the aluminum. The light oil distilled from the coal tar of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is also being tested. According to Mr. Gao Chongxi, head of the chemistry department, "benzene" and "camphor" can be extracted from light oil, which has great uses and can be used to manufacture explosives and medicines. In the past, architecture students designed houses mostly according to Western designs, mostly high-rise buildings, but now they serve the vast number of farmers, specifically visiting rural areas to plan the renovation of existing farmhouses to make them more hygienic and comfortable. The professors are also doing the same, such as a professor in the chemistry department who studied the coal gas produced by the Shijingshan Power Plant and believes that if it is utilized, it can provide fuel for one-third of the population of Beiping. A professor in the mechanical engineering department saw in the newspaper that tens of thousands of carts were transporting grain to support the front lines, and he carefully studied the farm carts and found that there were many unreasonable aspects to the structure of the carts. Therefore, he suggested that the Ministry of Enterprise invite professors from the engineering college to cooperate on a division of labor during the summer vacation to conduct research and improvement.

　　清华实验工作结合实际
  　为工厂化验原料
    为农民设计房舍
    【本报讯】北平清华大学理工科结合实际，开始为工厂化验工业原料，建筑系也开始研究农家房舍。理工科现正化验某航空机关，送来制造飞机用的铝：先由土木系材料试验室试验铝的伸张引力和压缩引力，又由化学系分析铝所含杂质的成分。石景山钢铁厂煤胶所蒸镏出的轻油也经化验。据化学系主任高崇熙先生谈：从轻油中可以提炼出“苯”和“樟脑”，用途很大，可以制造炸药和医药用品。建筑系学生过去设计房屋，过去多按照西洋构图设计、多为高楼大厦、现为广大农民服务，特访问农村，计划改造旧有的农家房舍，使其较为卫生舒适，各教授亦是如此，如化学系某教授研究了石景山发电厂所出的煤汽，认为若加利用，即可供北平三分之一人口的燃料。机械系某教授看到报上登载着千万辆大车运送粮食支援前线，即细心研究农家大车，发现大车构造有很多不合理的地方，因此他建议企业部到暑期中邀请工学院教授分工合作，进行研究改良。（金凤）
