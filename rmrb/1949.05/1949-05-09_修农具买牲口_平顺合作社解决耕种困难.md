Repairing Farm Tools and Buying Livestock
Ping顺 Cooperative Solves Farming Difficulties

[This newspaper's report] The Ping顺 County Wu乐 and other village cooperatives value the demands of their members and earnestly solve the practical difficulties of spring plowing and production for their members. In mid-last month, when the masses in Wu乐 Village inspected the preparations for spring plowing, they discovered that the farm tools damaged over the years had not yet been repaired, many people still lacked farm tools and fertilizer, and there was a shortage of firewood. In view of the above situation, Wang Jingong, the director of the cooperative, convened a meeting of staff members to discuss and clarify how to solve the difficulties of spring plowing and production for the masses of members (all the villagers have joined the cooperative), as the central task of the cooperative at present. After the meeting, they immediately helped the blacksmith Fu Qiuhua and three others to restore the blacksmith's furnace and rush to repair farm tools. They have now repaired 93 large and small farm tools; and sent people to ××安 to buy back 300 plowshares and 50 iron ×'s, and to Hu关 to buy back manure baskets and fertilizer baskets. They also bought back 2,700 jin of sesame cakes from Changzhi and sold them to the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs at low prices. They also organized the masses to transport goods, earning 3.09 million yuan in freight charges in one month, which solved the problem of the masses not having money to buy coal. This action of the cooperative has greatly promoted the production campaign in the village. Shi窑着 in the Seventh District is a poor mountain village, worried about lacking food and drink during the busy spring season. After learning about the situation, the village cooperative investigated and found that Huangqin (a local medicinal material) was marketable, so it mobilized all the men and women in the village to seize the time to dig 5,000 jin of Huangqin, and tried to sell it in time, earning 26,000 yuan (including transportation labor) for the masses before and after. It was supported by the broad masses of members. Two blacksmith's furnaces were also hired, and the cooperative supplied charcoal and iron, specializing in repairing and manufacturing farm tools for the villagers. The Lan岩 administrative village in the Sixth District, including 13 natural villages distributed in deep mountain valleys, has more female donkeys. In order to facilitate the breeding of livestock, the village cooperative specially purchased a "stud horse," which has bred more than ten foals in the past 20 days. Because the village is poor and has thin land, and it is difficult to prevent disasters, the cooperative is also preparing early-maturing crop seeds (high-quality Jin Cao Gu seeds) to adjust to the masses at low prices.

    修农具买牲口
    平顺合作社解决耕种困难
    【本报讯】平顺县吾乐等村合作社，重视社员要求，切实解决社员春耕生产中的实际困难。当上月中旬吾乐村群众检查春耕准备工作时，发现历年损坏的农具仍未修理，不少群众仍缺农具短肥料，烧柴不足。根据以上情况，合作社长王进功同志召开了职员会议，展开讨论，明确了如何解决社员群众（本村群众都已入社）春耕生产中的困难，是合作社当前的中心工作。会后即动手帮助铁匠傅七华等四人，恢复了铁匠炉，赶修农具，现已修好大小农具九十三件；并派人到××安买回犁铧三百个、铁×五十张、到壶关买回送粪筐、几担肥筐子、又从长治买回麻饼二千七百斤，低价卖给烈军属。并组织群众运输，一个月赚脚价三百零九万元，解决了群众无钱买煤的困难。合作社的这一行动，大大推动了该村生产运动的进行。七区石窑着是个穷山村，发愁春忙时缺吃喝。该村合作社了解情况后，调查了黄芹（本地出产的一种药材）有销路，便发动全村男女群众抓紧时间刨了五千斤黄芹，并设法及时推销出去，前后为群众收入人民币二万六千元（运输脚力在内）。得到广大社员群众的拥护。又聘请了两个铁匠炉，由合作社供给炭和铁，专为本村群众修造农具。六区的蓝岩行政村，包括分布在深山沟里的十三个自然村，喂母驴的较多，为便利繁殖牲畜，该村合作社特购买“种马”一匹，二十天来已配驹十余个。因该村地薄贫困，预防灾荒困难，合作社又准备早熟作物种籽（优金草谷种）低价调剂予群众。
