    The Signal of the People's Revolution - The May Fourth Movement
    Huang Yanpei
    In the distant universe, in the course of tens of millions of years of evolution, after a long period of gradual change, a sudden change occurs. The process of sudden change may be divided into several stages before finally reaching success.
    The Chinese People's Revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has today embarked on a path to success. Its movement did not begin today. The Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927 also once demonstrated its strength. The earliest was the May Fourth Movement. It was the first to express the power of the people in a sudden way. Today, it is completing the process of sudden change, and the work of the People's Revolution is like a farmer's hope for an autumn harvest after spring plowing and summer cultivation, hoping that its mission will be accomplished.
    To unleash the power of the people in a sudden way is the essence of the mission borne by the May Fourth Movement. And overthrowing Cao (Rulin), Lu (Zongyu), and Zhang (Zongxiang) was a good topic given to it by the warlords at the time. For example, in 1926, when the Shanghai British Concession police fired to stop a student parade, this good topic led to the May Thirtieth Incident. The May Fourth and May Thirtieth incidents differed in scope but were similar in nature. The May Fourth Movement was indeed a signal flare in the early stage of the development of the People's Revolution, just as the Huanghuagang Uprising was a signal flare in the process of the Xinhai National Revolution.
    Because the May Fourth Movement belonged to the initial stage of the People's Revolution, the members of that movement were particularly complex. A very small number led the movement with the aim of carrying out the People's Revolution, and some participated in the movement out of a patriotic impulse without understanding the meaning of the People's Revolution. The vast majority in the middle were like extras in a play, writing impassioned articles, holding white flags, shouting slogans, and following others. At the time, they seemed to be progressive elements, but when the situation changed and the critical moment arrived, they would engage in reactionary behavior. Many of the revolutionary targets in the successful stage of the People's Revolution were prominent figures from the May Fourth period for this reason.
    Only in the cold of winter do we know the pine and cypress; the more the flowers wither, the more precious the pine and cypress appear. Today, standing at the time when the People's Revolution is being completed, to commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must commemorate the leaders of the movement at that time, and we should also recognize the meaning of the People's Revolution. Why has the Chinese Communist Party succeeded in leading the People's Revolution with New Democracy? Why has it succeeded so quickly and thoroughly? What methods did they use to lead the people? What do the people gain after the success of the revolution? All of this needs to be clearly understood by us. Once we understand clearly, each of us must sincerely become a member in this movement, not just following others. The May Fourth Movement is a good mirror for us.

    人民革命的信炮——五四运动
    黄炎培
    遥遥的世宙，在几千万年进化途程中，经过长时期的渐变，来一个突变，突变的程序，有时会分做若干阶段、最后才到达了成功。
    中国人民革命，经中国共产党领导，到今天走上了成功的途径。它的运动，不始于今天，民十六国民革命军北伐，也曾一度表现它的力量，最早乃是五四运动。它首先把人民的力量，用突变的方式表现出来。到今天才在完成突变的程序，而人民革命工作，恰等于农家经过春耕夏耘而秋收希望它的使命从此完成。
    用突变的方式，发挥人民力量，这是五四运动所负荷的使命的本质。而打倒曹（汝霖）陆（宗舆）章（宗祥）乃是当时军阀送给它的好题目。例如民十五，上海英租界巡捕开枪制止学生游行，有了这个好题目，便有五卅事件发生，五四和五卅，两者范围大小不同，而性质略同，而五四实是人民革命历史发展初期的一个信炮，恰等于黄花冈一役是辛亥民族革命过程中间的一个信炮。
    为了五四运动，属于人民革命发动的最初期，所以那一回运动的成员特别复杂。极少数是把人民革命做目的来领导运动的，也有并没有了解人民革命意义，仅发于爱国的一念，来参加运动的。中间最大多数，等于戏场里的跑龙套，尽管写出激昂慷慨的文章，尽管擎着白旗，喊着口号，跟着人家跑，当时很象是前进分子，情势一变、紧要关头到了，他们会干出反动行为，人民革命运动成功期的革命对象，不少五四时期轰轰烈烈的人物，就是这个缘故。
    岁寒知松柏，有了百卉的凋零，越显出松柏的珍贵，我们今天站在人民革命完成时期，来纪念五四，要纪念当时的运动领导者，还应该认清人民革命的意义，中国共产党用新民主主义来领导人民革命，何以会成功？何以成功得这样迅速，彻底？他们用怎样方法来领导人民的？革命成功后，人民所得到的是什么？这都是需要我们清清楚楚地认识。认识清楚了，我们每一个人要诚心诚意地做这回运动中间一个成员，不光是跟着人家跑，五四运动，就是给予我们一面很好的镜子。
