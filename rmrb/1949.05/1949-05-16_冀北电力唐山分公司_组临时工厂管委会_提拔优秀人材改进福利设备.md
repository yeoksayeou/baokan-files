[Tangshan Electric] Recently, the Tangshan Branch of Jibei Electric Power Company received instructions from the Tangshan Military Control Commission to form a temporary factory management committee composed of the company's military representative, branch manager, engineer, chairman of the workers' union preparatory committee, and worker representatives, totaling nine people, to initially implement democratic management. After deliberation and extensive discussion, the first meeting decided to make necessary adjustments to the company's internal personnel, absorbing and promoting outstanding individuals who have emerged in learning and production to participate in enterprise management. In addition, the factory, based on the proposals of the worker representative meeting and the company's financial resources, is actively constructing employee welfare facilities that can be improved. Construction of ten rooms for the cooperative, bathhouse, barbershop, and tea room, etc., began on the 6th of this month. In the past, the living quarters for coal carriers were simple, with small rooms and many people, few doors and windows, and no bathrooms or changing rooms, which was very unhygienic. Starting in mid-month, six new dormitories will be built, and the current cramped workshops will be converted into bathrooms, changing rooms, dining halls, and study rooms exclusively for coal carriers.

　　冀北电力唐山分公司
  　组临时工厂管委会
    提拔优秀人材改进福利设备
    【唐山电】冀北电力公司唐山分公司，近奉唐山军管会指令，由该公司的军事代表及分公司经理、工程师、职工筹委会主任、职工代表等九人组成临时工厂管理委员会，初步实行民主化管理。经过酝酿和多方研讨，在首次会议上决定对公司内部人事作必要调整，吸收与提拔在学习和生产中涌现出来的优秀分子，参加企业管理。另外，厂方并根据职工代表会议提案及公司财力，积极兴建可能改善的职工福利设备。本月六日开始修筑合作社、浴室、理发、茶炉房等十间房屋。抬煤工人宿舍过去建筑简陋，房小人多，门窗太少，没有浴室与更衣室，很不卫生。本月中旬将开始另盖六间新宿舍，把现在狭窄的工房，改修为抬煤工人专用的浴室、更衣室、饭厅及学习室等。
