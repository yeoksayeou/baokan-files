    North China Administrative Committee Rescinds Previous Order
    Permitting Private Merchants to Transport Grain into the Region
    40 Million Jin of Grain Successively Transported to Tianjin

    [This newspaper reported] To fully supply grain to North China, the North China Administrative Committee has decided to rescind the previous order prohibiting private merchants from transporting grain from the Northeast into the region, and to permit the transport of grain into the region. Due to a lack of rainfall in areas such as central and southern Hebei within the North China region, grain prices have gradually risen since late April. As a result, grain from Tianjin and other cities flowed back into the countryside, causing grain prices in Tianjin and other areas to rise accordingly. To help stabilize grain prices and fully supply food to North China, the North China Administrative Committee decided to rescind the previous order prohibiting private merchants from transporting grain into the region, allowing merchants to freely transport grain into the region. It also notified the Railway Bureau to increase the number of grain transport vehicles to ensure a steady supply of food from the Northeast into the region. Furthermore, on April 28th, the North China Trade Corporation dispatched Wang Yimin, the Grain and Oil Department head of the Tianjin Trade Corporation, to Shenyang to negotiate grain purchases for the North China region, which has yielded considerable results. Of the 40 million jin of grain shipped from Shenyang, a portion has already been transported to Tianjin. It is estimated that after a large amount of grain from the Northeast enters the region, the grain shortage in North China will be alleviated, and grain prices should tend to stabilize.

    华北行政委员会撤销前令
    准许私商运粮入关
    四千万斤粮食陆续运津
    【本报讯】华北行政委员会为充分供应华北粮食，决定撤销前禁止私商贩运东北粮食入关的命令，准许贩运粮食入关。华北区冀中、冀南等地因雨量缺乏，自四月下旬起粮价逐渐上涨，平津粮食倒流入农村，以致平津等地粮价随之上升，华北行政委员会为帮助平抑粮价，充分供给华北食粮，决定撤销前禁止私商贩运粮食入关命令，准许商人自由贩运粮食入关，并通知铁路局增加运粮车辆，以保证东北食粮源源入关，华北贸易总公司并于四月二十八日派天津贸易公司粮油部长王一民前往沈阳接洽华北地区购粮事宜，已获相当结果，由沈阳启运之四千万斤粮食，有一部已运至天津。估计东北粮食大量入关后，华北粮食困难即可减轻，粮价当可趋向稳定。
