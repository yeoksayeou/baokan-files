Heroic and Resourceful Protection of Machinery
　　Datong Railway Workers Welcome the Liberation Army
    [Chahar News] Datong railway workers protected machinery and equipment with heroic and resourceful actions, and welcomed the Liberation Army with unparalleled enthusiasm. Before the liberation of Datong, the Kuomintang's reactionary army carried out sabotage on various sections of Datong Station. According to incomplete statistics, the engine section alone had 1,050 iron tiles removed from the roof, 500 panes of glass broken, and doors and windows damaged. They also attempted to destroy the machinery. The workers immediately gave a strong resistance. The workers of the engine section used resourceful actions to hide the machines; ten workers in the water pump room, under the leadership of inspector Liu Jintian, driver, and stoker, drained the water pipes on February 14, disassembled and removed copper parts, and hid the steam gauges in the boiler. Fire hooks, fire rakes, rubber pipes and other parts were buried separately near the water pump room. Telephones, files, screws and other smaller parts were kept separately by each individual; the workers in the technical section hid all the machine repair tools in the chimneys of two broken locomotives. To prevent the enemy from opening them, three or four workers worked together to tighten the screws. After the liberation of Datong, in order to welcome our army's train into the station, the workers of the engineering section dug out the eighty iron shovels and eighty-five picks they had hidden, immediately cleared the obstacles to traffic, and quickly inspected and repaired the turnouts. In order to avoid the danger of our army's train having to stop due to difficulty in water supply when entering the station, the inspector of the water pump room and the workers of the technical section of the engine section, in only eight hours, repaired the water pump, which had been out of service for nearly three months due to missing parts. From the 30th of last month to the 3rd of this month, the staff and workers of the engine section worked intensively for four days and repaired five locomotives that had been out of service for more than five months.

　　英勇机智保护机器
  　大同路工迎接解放军
    【察哈尔讯】大同铁路工人以英勇机智的行动保护了机器、器材，并以无比的热情迎接解放军。大同未解放前，国民党的反动军队对大同车站各段进行破坏。据不完整的统计，仅机务段即被拆去房顶铁瓦一千零五十块，打烂玻璃五百块，及门窗等，还企图破坏机器。工人们立即给以有力的反抗。机务段工人用机智的行动掩藏了机器；水泵房十个工人在检工员刘金田、司机、司炉领导下二月十四日把水管的水排出，拆开取出铜器零件，并把汽表掩藏在锅炉里，火钩、火扒、胶皮管等零件分别埋在水泵房附近，电话机、锉刀、螺丝等较小零件各自分别保管；技术室工人把所有修理机器的工具藏在两部破机车的烟囱里，为防止敌人打开，三四个工人一起用力拧紧螺丝，大同解放后，工务段工人为迎接我军列车进站，刨出藏下的八十张铁锨和八十五张镐头，立即扫除了行车的障碍，并迅速检查整修了叉道。为免除我军列车进站因给水困难而停火的危险，机务段水泵房检查员和技术室工人仅用了八小时的工夫，修好了缺少零件停燃将近三月的水泵。机务段职工从上月三十日起至本月三日止四天中，紧张突击，修理好了停燃五月余的五台机车。
