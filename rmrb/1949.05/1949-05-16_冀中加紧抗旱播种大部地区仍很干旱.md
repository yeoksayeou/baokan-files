　　Central Hebei Speeds Up Drought-Resistant Planting, Most Areas Still Very Arid
　　[Reported by this newspaper] According to a report from the Central Hebei District to the North China People's Government, the entire district is experiencing widespread drought and dry land. Except for irrigated land and areas that were watered last year, which can be sown and seedlings planted, the vast majority of other areas cannot be sown. The area is now making every effort to carry out drought-resistant planting. Irrigated areas are widely organizing the use of wells, canals, ditches, and all possible water sources for planting in shaded areas. Areas without water sources are fully mobilizing the masses to carry out a soil well digging campaign and implement point-watering planting. As of the 25th of last month, incomplete statistics show that more than 21,000 soil wells have been dug, 1,844 water wells have been repaired, 2,690 new waterwheels have been added, 3,614 waterwheels have been repaired, and eight canals have been opened. The planting of sorghum, millet and other food crops has been basically completed in irrigated and watered land. Cotton and peanut planting is now underway in both irrigated and dry land.
　　From the 1st of this month to the present, except for Xinle, Ding County, and a portion of Quyang, where more than 20 villages had about four fingers of rain in three days, other areas have been dry and without rain. 36,000 mu of drought-stricken wheat has already died in Raoyang. Wheat is experiencing insect pests due to the drought. Wheat fields in Beixingzhuang and other three villages in the fourth district of Qingyuan have discovered stem borers. 20 mu of wheat fields in Beixingzhuang have already been damaged. Wheat leaf bees have been found in wheat fields near Jin County's sixth district and Baoding, and their harm is worse than that of spider mites. The most serious case is in Pengxue Village in Yecheng, where the leaves of wheat in six mu of wheat fields have been eaten halfway. For severe cases of insect pests, farms are using chemicals to kill them, while for lighter cases, the masses are being mobilized to catch and kill them. Guanjia Village in Jin County can catch 40 jin in one day. Insect pests have occurred in fruit trees in Zhao County and Gaocheng, one being pear weevil, and the other resembling black beetle insects. The leaves of more than 200 mu of pear trees in Jiaozhong Village in the second district of Gaocheng have been damaged. Jujube trees in Jianguo Qingcang area have also discovered weevils, with severe cases resulting in the leaves of the jujube trees being completely eaten. Farms are organizing forces equipped with sprayers to kill these two types of fruit tree insects. Currently, cadres and farmers in the area are carrying out a drought-resistant and rush-planting campaign, organizing all forces to wage a resolute struggle against drought and insect pests.

　　冀中加紧抗旱播种大部地区仍很干旱
    【本报讯】据冀中区向华北人民政府报告，全区普遍天旱地干，除水浇地和去年过水的地区能播种按苗外，其他广大地区都不能播种。现该地正以全力进行抗旱播种。水浇地区则广泛的组织使用水井、渠道、河沟，及一切可能利用的水源，进行阴地播种。无水源地区，则全力发动群众，开展挖土井运动，实行点水播种。截至上月二十五日前不完全统计，已挖土井二万一千多眼，修水井一千八百四十四眼，增添新水车二千六百九十辆，修水车三千六百一十四辆，开渠八道。现水浇地水脱地已基本上完成了高粱、谷等粮食作物播种。水旱地现正进行棉花、花生的播种。
    本月一日至现在，除新乐、定县与曲阳一部有二十余村在三日曾下雨四指外，其他地区均干旱无雨，饶阳旱麦已死三万六千余亩。小麦因天旱发生虫灾，清苑四区北幸庄等三村麦田发现钻心虫，北幸庄麦田二十亩已被吃坏。晋县六区及保定附近麦田发现麦叶蜂，危害甚于火蜘蛛，最重者为叶城朋学村，六亩麦田之麦叶被吃半截。现对虫害重者由农场用药品捕杀，轻者发动群众捕打。晋县管下村一天能打四十斤。赵县藁城之果树发生虫害，一种是梨步曲，一种似黑牛虫。藁城二区角中村二百多亩梨树的叶子被咬坏。建国青沧一带枣树亦发现步曲，重的将枣树叶吃光。这两种果树的虫均由农场组织力量携喷雾器前往捕杀。现该区干部农民正进行抗旱抢种运动，组织一切力量，向干旱虫害进行坚决的斗争。
