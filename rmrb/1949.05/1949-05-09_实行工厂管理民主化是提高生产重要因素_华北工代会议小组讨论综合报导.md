    Implementing Democratic Factory Management is an Important Factor in Improving Production
    Comprehensive Report of Group Discussions at the North China Workers' Congress
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The group discussions held over the past few days at the North China Workers' Representative Conference mainly focused on issues such as the democratization of factory management, suggestions to the government to establish supply stores and consumer cooperatives to protect workers' actual wages, collective contracts for state-owned and public enterprises, and labor-capital relations in private enterprises. The following is a comprehensive report on the content of the discussions over the past few days:
    Regarding the democratization of factory management and the establishment of factory management committees and factory worker representative conferences in state-owned and public enterprises, the representatives unanimously agreed that this is an important guarantee for relying on workers to run factories well in the recovery and development of production. The representatives cited many examples: For example, at the Dazhong Coal Mine in Shahe, Taihang District, the installation of more than 700 meters of water pipes and a one-and-a-half-mile-long drainage ditch for a pumping project was completed seven days ahead of schedule under difficult conditions due to incomplete equipment, thanks to research and discussion by the factory management committee and more than 200 workers; the No. 2 Iron and Steel Parts Factory of the Pingjin Railway Bureau made a profit in April, and after the person in charge publicly reported to all employees, the workers were very happy and automatically requested to increase the night shift, and the production efficiency of the iron extraction department in April was doubled compared to the past. However, at the Huafeng Iron Factory in Changzhi, Taihang, a production plan was made in December last year, but most workers did not know the content of the plan until the end of the month, and therefore could not complete it. Facts fully illustrate that only by implementing democratic management, enhancing the sense of ownership of the enterprise among the working masses, can the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses be brought into play, and production can be improved and enhanced. Representatives from the old liberated areas, based on the spirit of the conference, generally felt that they had insufficient understanding of the spirit of democratic management in the past, and some factory leaders unilaterally understood the factory director responsibility system, relying solely on their personal abilities to run the factory and not caring about the work of the trade union. Comrade Li Dongfang, representative of Taihang Industrial Company, said: This is the result of not understanding the consistency of the factory director responsibility system and democratic management. Trade union representatives also reviewed that they did not care enough about increasing production in the past and did not help the factory director and manager much. Each delegation also provided many specific opinions on the organization, functions, working relationship, and working system of the factory management committee and the factory worker representative conference, and emphasized that management cadres should strengthen democratic style to ensure the smooth implementation of democratic management. Representatives from factories belonging to the military industry system felt that it was also very important to implement democratic management. In addition, the old liberated areas delegations also enthusiastically discussed the issue of carrying out the democratic management movement in state-owned and public factories. Everyone believed that this is a mass viewpoint issue of relying on the working masses and believing in the power of the workers. Worker representatives from the Jizhong area specially reminded that they should not be complacent because they had done something in the past and feel that there is no problem. Regarding the methods for carrying out the democratic factory management movement, they believed that it should be fully deliberated, and preparations should be made for leadership to be implemented from the administrative leadership cadres taking the lead, so that the entire factory can implement it. Regarding the establishment of supply stores and consumer cooperatives to protect workers' actual wages, after listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech on this issue, the representatives unanimously agreed that this is the most effective method. Employee representatives from the PingSui Railway said: This is a complete solution for the workers. The representatives proposed that the conference make a decision to suggest that the government establish supply stores to ration the main necessities of life, such as grain, cloth, oil, salt, and coal, to employees and their families in state-owned and public enterprises at prices lower than the market price. They said: "This can avoid the exploitation of middlemen after the payment of wages, as well as price fluctuations caused by speculation." In addition, the representatives also reviewed the past policies of running employee consumer cooperatives. To varying degrees, various places (especially old areas) once had a purely profit-oriented view, and some cooperatives were located in market towns far from the city, which did not help the lives of employees.
    Regarding the collective contracts of state-owned and public factories and the labor-capital relations of private factories, the representatives provided many specific opinions based on the principle of "both public and private, both labor and capital benefit." Some representatives also reviewed that the factory administration did not take enough care of the workers' lives. For example, the Jingxing Coal Mine did not consult with the trade union on some major issues related to workers' lives. The representatives also supplemented and revised the draft collective contract prepared by the preparatory committee, and proposed that the specific conditions of different regions should be taken into account. Regarding labor-capital relations, many specific issues were also involved. For example, when talking about specific issues such as overtime pay, severance pay, and dismissal, they can both take care of the interests of employees and take care of the specific conditions of factory production. Li Huipei, a representative from Tianjin, said: "We must let the capitalists expand production as much as possible." Representatives from Taiyue and Taihang said: "We should unite with national capitalists to develop production. Of course, if there are violations of policies and laws, or places that do not take into account the basic living interests of workers, there must also be criticism and struggle."
    The intense progress of the group discussions has enabled the valuable opinions from various places to be concentrated. Based on the suggestions, the conference has formulated three draft resolutions: a resolution on implementing democratic factory management and establishing factory management committees and employee representative meetings in state-owned and public factories, a resolution on establishing supply stores and consumer cooperatives to protect the lives of employees, and an outline of collective contracts for public enterprises in North China. These will be submitted to the groups again today (the 9th) for full discussion, and then submitted to the conference for adoption and implementation.

    实行工厂管理民主化是提高生产重要因素
    华北工代会议小组讨论综合报导
    【本报讯】华北职工代表会议连日举行之小组讨论，主要是集中对于工厂管理民主化，建议政府设立供给商店与消费合作社，以保障工人之实际工资及国营、公营企业之集体合同和私营企业之劳资关系等问题。兹就数日来讨论内容综合报导如下：
    关于工厂管理民主化、在国营公营企业中建立工厂管理委员会及工厂职工代表会的问题，代表们一致认为这是恢复和发展生产中依靠职工办好工厂的重要保证。代表们举了许多例证：如太行区沙河大众煤矿，由于通过工厂管理委员会和二百多职工的研究讨论。使得需要按装七百多米达水管和一里半长水沟的抽水工程，在器材不全的困难条件下，比原计划提前七天完成；平津铁路局第二钢铁配件厂，四月份赚了钱，负责人公开向全体职工报告以后，工人们很高兴，自动要求增加夜班，拔铁部四月份生产效率，比过去提高一倍。而太行长治华丰铁工厂，去年十二月订了生产计划，直至月底大多数工人还不知道计划内容，因而也就无法完成。事实充分说明：只有实行民主管理，增进工人群众对企业主人翁的感觉，才能发扬职工群众的积极性、创造性，改进和提高生产。老区代表根据大会精神，普遍感到过去对民主管理的精神认识不足，某些工厂负责人片面的体会了厂长负责制，单纯凭个人能力去办理工厂，不关心工会工作、太行实业公司代表李东方同志说：这是没有领会厂长负责制和管理民主化的一致性的结果，工会代表也检讨过去对增产关心不够，对厂长和经理帮助不大。各代表团并就工厂管理委员会和工厂职工代表会的组织、职权、工作关系及工作制度等具体问题提供了许多具体意见。并强调管理干部应加强民主作风，以保证民主管理的顺利执行。属于军工系统的工厂，代表们觉得实行民主管理也非常重要。此外，老区代表团并热烈讨论了在国营、公营工厂里开展管理民主化运动的问题。大家认为：这就是一个依靠职工群众和相信工人力量的群众观点问题。冀中区的工人代表特别提醒说：不要以为过去曾经作了一下，因而自满，感觉到没有问题。关于开展工厂管理民主化运动的办法，他们认为应当经过充分酝酿，有准备有领导的从行政领导干部先以身作则，以致全厂贯彻执行。关于建立供给商店及消费合作社，以保障工人实际工资的问题，代表们在听取刘少奇同志关于这个问题的讲话之后，一致认为：这是最有效的办法。平绥铁路职工代表说：这完全是为工人想了办法。代表们提议由大会作出决定，建议政府设立供给商店，低于市价定量配售国营、公营企业职工及其家属主要生活必需品，如粮、布、油、盐、煤等。他们说：“这样就可以避免在发放工资后中间商人的剥削，以及由于投机商人操纵所引起的物价波动。”此外，代表们并检讨了过去办理职工消费合作社的方针，各地（尤其老区）或多或少都曾经存在着单纯营利观点，有的合作社设在离城很多的集镇上，对于职工生活并无帮助。
    关于国营公营工厂的集体合同和私营工厂的劳资关系问题，代表们依据“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针，提供了许多具体意见。有的代表对工厂行政上照顾工人生活不够也作了检讨，如井矿煤矿在与工人生活有关的较大问题，有的没有和工会商量。代表们并就筹委会制订的集体合同草案作了补充修正，并提出应当照顾不同地区的具体条件。关于劳资关系，同样涉及了许多具体问题，如谈到加班费、遣散费、解雇等具体问题时，都能一方面照顾职工利益，一方面照顾工厂生产的具体条件。天津代表李慧培说：“要让资本家尽量扩大生产。”太岳、太行的代表说：“对民族资本家，应该联合他们发展生产，当然，如果有违反政策法令，或是不顾工人基本生活利益的地方，也要有批评，有斗争。”
    小组讨论的紧张进行，使得各地珍贵的意见能够集中起来，会议根据建议已制订关于实行工厂管理民主化而建立国营、公营工厂中工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的决定，建立供给商店与消费合作社保障职工生活的决议、华北公营企业集体合同纲要等三种草案，并于今日（九日）再交小组充分讨论，然后提交大会通过。公布实行。
