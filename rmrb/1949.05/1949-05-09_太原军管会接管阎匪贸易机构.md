    (Taiyuan dispatch) The Taiyuan Military Control Commission's trade group has preliminarily completed the takeover of the Yan Clique's bureaucratic trade organizations. These include: Shanxi Trading Company, Materials Reserve Depot, People's Economic Executive Committee, cooperatives, and the 75 subordinate units and 139 large and small warehouses under their jurisdiction. Each group conducted policy propaganda, sealed up warehouses and materials, searched for original personnel, and created inventories. When the Yan Clique fled, they converted a large amount of materials into gold and silver and carried it away; another part has been hidden and dispersed and is being investigated. This takeover once again proves that "seizing the puppet leading organs and promoting the handover of subordinate units" is the most successful method of takeover, as it does not disrupt the original enterprise structure and facilitates the takeover. For example, the takeover of the Shanxi Trading Company was done relatively well in this regard, ensuring that all 154 people in its 11 subordinate units, from the general manager to the cook, were present for the takeover, which proceeded quickly. Secondly, investigation and research work is extremely important in the takeover process. The trade takeover group specifically set up an investigation group, and each group had investigators who investigated and found 13 new units to be taken over, providing a great deal of useful information for the takeover work. Thirdly, the takeover of financial and trade departments must be equipped with strong accounting cadres. In this takeover, the takeover was faster for those takeover cadres who were proficient in accounting techniques or had some knowledge of the subject, and slower for those who were not. Finally, this initial takeover work was generally smooth and complete, mainly because the cadres implemented the takeover discipline and the system of requesting instructions and reporting. The trade takeover group's work has now entered the stage of inventorying materials.

    太原军管会接管阎匪贸易机构
    【太原电】太原军管会贸易组初步完成接管阎匪官僚贸易机构。计有：山西贸易公司、实物准备库、平民经济执行委员会、合作社等及所辖的七十五个单位一百三十九个大小仓库。各小组均进行了宣传政策，查封仓库、物资、寻找原有人员，造其清册等工作。阎匪逃走时已将大批物资，换为金银携跑；另有一部份已被隐藏疏散正在清查。此次接管中再次证明，“抓住伪首脑机关，推动所属单位办理移交”，是接管中最成功的办法，这样作可以不打破原来的企业机构，便于接管。如山西贸易公司的接管这一点即做的较好，使下属之十一个单位一百五十四人，上至总协理下至伙夫一人不缺，进行接管速度也较快。其次在接管中之调查研究工作极其重要。此次贸易接管组曾专设了调查组，各小组并设有调查员，前后调查出新的应接管单位十三个，供给了不少对接管工作有用的情况。再次金融贸易部门的接管，必须配备强有力的会计干部，此次接管中凡接管干部对会计技术熟练的或略会常识者则接管的较快，反之接管的较慢。最后，此次初步接管工作一般顺利，接管的也完整，其主要保证是干部执行了接管纪律与请示报告制度，现贸易接管组工作已进入清点物资阶段中。
