　　Organize Cooperative Societies to Exchange Labor for Agricultural Products
    Although the work done in regulating urban-rural economic relations in the past was insufficient, plans are being made to strengthen it. Usually, when grain is difficult to sell, farmers in the surrounding villages can sell it to the grain stores at market prices at any time; and they can purchase daily necessities at the retail department, avoiding exploitation by merchants. Therefore, the farmers generally feel: "If it weren't for Dongxing Grain Store, we would suffer." Now, many farmers can sell grain directly to the grain store without going through the market. In coordination with the spring plowing campaign, 500,000 jin of cotton seeds were purchased in Langfang for the farmers of the Eighth Sub-district of Hebei-Central, and plans are being made to exchange a large amount of black beans for bean cakes to fertilize the rural areas. In order to further regulate urban-rural and friendly-region relations and promote economic prosperity, it is planned to add production cooperative groups within the month, with five people regularly actively contacting cooperative societies in various counties and villages and trade departments in friendly regions to complete the task of exchanging rural products for urban industrial products.
    The head office is now vigorously assisting local production promotion societies and trade union organizations to organize various cooperative societies. According to the instructions of the North China Trade Corporation, members of consumer cooperatives are given a price discount of 3% to 5% lower than the retail department when purchasing goods; other cooperatives are given a price discount of 1% to 3% lower than the retail department. On March 16th, fifty-four members of the Cang City Water and Electricity Company Employee Consumer Cooperative purchased a total of 4,320 jin of corn at a price of four jiao lower per jin than the retail department. In the government's active organization of production for impoverished citizens, from March 10th to April 2nd, the head office, through the introduction of the promotion society and districts, gave 2,419,262 jin of millet allocated from the Shanghai area to 373 poor households (including 176 households of farmers from more than 60 villages in the disaster area of Cang County) to be milled into rice. For every 100 jin of millet, 70.5 jin of rice are delivered, earning 4.5 jin of rice and 25 jin of bran. Each household (calculated as two people) can mill at least 600 jin of millet per day (the highest being 900 jin), earning 27 jin of rice and 150 jin of bran. After deducting transportation costs, each household can earn at least 27 jin of rice per day.
    The head office's operation to date has been correct in its overall direction. However, some small areas still need attention, such as the inspection system not being sound enough. The current difficulties that need the assistance of the government and the North China Trade Corporation to resolve are: (1) Shortage of civilian goods. Now that cooperative societies are being established one after another, the goods in the retail department are about to run out. If the North China Trade Corporation does not allocate them in time, the supply will inevitably be interrupted. (2) Some civilian goods arrive inappropriately in terms of timing, such as special white fine cloth, which the local people do not wear. Even if someone wears it, it will only be sold in May or June, but it arrived in February. (3) The cloth allocated by the North China Trade Corporation has no price (such as special white fine cloth), and there is no such cloth on the market for comparison, making it impossible to grasp the appropriate price. (4) Lack of transportation tools (especially boats). The store currently has 38 million jin of grain stored in riverside warehouses in Boshi, Lianzhen, and Cang City. When the river floods during the rainy season, even if it is not washed away, it will inevitably be damp and moldy. (A Qi)

　　组织合作社交换工农产品
    在调剂城乡经济关系方面，过去做得虽然不够，但正在计划加强。平常在粮食不好销售的时候，四乡的农民随时都可以按市价卖给粮栈；并可在门市部购买生活必需品，避免商人从中来回剥削。所以农民们都普遍地感到：“要没有东兴粮栈，咱们可要吃亏了。”现在许多农民可以不经过市场，就直接把粮食卖给粮栈。配合着春耕运动，在廊坊购买了五十万斤棉籽，供冀中八分区的农民使用，并计划以大量黑豆换取豆饼，给农村施肥。为了进一步的调剂城乡、友区的关系和促进经济繁荣，计划于月内增设生产合作组，经常有五个人主动地与各县、村的合作社、友区的贸易部门密切联系，完成以农村产品交换城市的工业成品的任务。
    现总店正在大力协助各地生产推进社、职工会组织各种合作社。按照华北贸易总公司的指示，凡消费合作社的社员购买物品时，均给予低于门市部百分之三至百分之五的价格优待；对其他合作社，给予低于门市部百分之一至百分之三价格的优待。沧市水电公司职工消费合作社五十四位社员在三月十六日，就以每斤低于门市部四角的价格共购得玉米四三二○斤。在政府积极组织贫苦市民生产当中，总店自三月十日至四月二日之间，通过推进社、和区的介绍，将由上海区拨来的谷子二、四一九、二六二斤给三七三贫户（其中一七六户为沧县六十余村灾区的农民）碾成米。每百斤谷交米七○·五斤，挣米四·五斤，糠二五斤。每天每户（以二人计）至少能碾谷子六○○斤（最高碾九○○斤），则挣米二十七斤，糠一五○斤。除去运费等，至少每天每户能挣米二十七斤。
    总店经营迄今，在总的方针上是正确的。但有些小的地方仍须注意。如检查制度尚不够健全等。目前存在的困难须要政府和华北贸易总公司协助解决的：（一）民用品缺乏，现合作社纷纷成立，而门市部的物品即将告罄，如华北贸总不及时拨下，势必供应中断。（二）民用品有些来得不适地适时，如特白细布，本地老百姓是不穿的。即使有人穿，也到五、六月才销，而二月份就来了。（三）华北贸总拨来的布没定价（如特白细布），市场上亦无此种布作比较，无法掌握适当价格。（四）运输工具（特别是船）缺乏，该店现有粮食三千八百万斤存于泊市、连镇、沧市的河边建库。到雨季河泛时，即使不被冲去，也难免潮湿发霉。（阿奇）
