　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 14th—Before Hangzhou's liberation, under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party's correct policies, workers in various industries in the city fulfilled their glorious duty as the working class, heroically and resourcefully protecting factories and equipment from looting and destruction by fleeing bandits. On May 3rd, two hours before the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou, the Shanghai National Party Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Engine Department ordered workers at the Zhakou Station (ten miles southwest of Hangzhou) locomotive depot by telephone to evacuate all locomotive materials to Shanghai. Upon hearing this, the workers dismantled the main parts of the locomotives and tried to deceive the Kuomintang bandit troops, so that all twelve locomotives in the factory were preserved intact. When the Kuomintang bandit troops prepared to flee and the situation was chaotic, employees of the Hangzhou Power Plant and Water Plant dispatched personnel to patrol and protect the factories. All the workers of the Zhejiang Highway Joint Transportation Office's automobile factory drove eleven complete vehicles to a remote new factory far from the highway to prevent the Kuomintang bandit troops from looting. They also unloaded the tires and battery boxes of nineteen vehicles and piled them in the scrap car yard. The factory's drivers and technicians hid elsewhere, leaving only a young worker to guard the five transport vehicles that could not be hidden in time. On the afternoon of April 29, retreating bandit troops rushed into the factory and forced the young worker to ask where the drivers were hiding. The bandits slapped him and hit him with gun butts, but he insisted on not telling the truth, so that the five transport vehicles could be preserved. Workers at the No. 2 Ramie Scouring Workshop of the China Textile Company's Hangzhou Office increased from six to thirty people to guard the warehouse and patrol to protect raw materials as the situation became tense. The workers also sank five ramie fishing boats to the bottom of the water to prevent them from being robbed by bandits. Automobile driver Lan Rongguang resisted the bandit troops' forced use of the factory's automobiles and drove back to the factory despite being shot at by the bandit troops. The workers of the Huafeng Paper Mill also built bunkers and guarded the factory with guns.

　　工人自动组织巡逻保护
  　保全杭州工厂
    【新华社杭州十四日电】杭州解放前，该市各业职工在中国共产党的正确政策影响下，尽了工人阶级的光荣天职，英勇机智地保护了工厂和器材免于溃匪的抢劫破坏。五月三日，人民解放军进抵杭市二小时前，上海国民党沪杭铁路机务处曾以电话命令闸口站（杭市西南十里）机车房工人将所有机车的物资撤至上海。该处工人闻讯后，即将机车主要部分拆掉，设法蒙蔽国民党匪军，使该厂现有之十二部机车，全部完好无损地保存下来。杭市发电厂、自来水厂职工们在国民党匪军准备逃窜而情况混乱时，都派出人员巡逻保护工厂。浙江公路联营运输处汽车厂全体工人，为防止国民党匪军抢劫，将十一部完整的车辆开到离公路较远的偏僻的新厂中去，另将十九辆车的轮胎、电箱卸下，堆在废车厂里。该厂司机、技工则躲到他处，只留一个青年工人坚持在厂里看守来不及掩藏的五辆运输车。四月二十九日下午，溃退的匪军冲进该厂，向该青年工人逼问司机藏匿处所。匪军用巴掌、枪托打他，但他坚持不吐真情，终使五部运输车得以保全。中国纺织公司杭州办事处麻纤维第二精洗工场工人，随着情况的紧张，由六个人增加到三十个人参加守卫仓库与巡逻保护原料，工人们并将五只捞麻船沉下水底防匪劫走。汽车司机蓝荣光抗拒匪军强拉工场的汽车使用，冒着匪军的枪击驶回工场。华丰造纸厂的工人并筑起地堡，持枪守护工厂。
