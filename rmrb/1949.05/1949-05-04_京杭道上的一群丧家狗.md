After the People's Liberation Army launched the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign on the 20th of last month, the Kuomintang bandit gang's senior officials in Nanjing frantically bought gold, silver dollars, and foreign exchange for one last time, vying for seats on planes and trains to escape. On the 22nd, amidst the rumbling artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang bandit troops in Pukou fled from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south bank of Xiaguan. Unable to wait for the boats to dock, they jumped into the water, climbed ashore, and fled south. Fearing being overtaken by the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang bandit troops ignored their comrades left behind in Jiangbei and burned the boats that reached the south bank. The Kuomintang bandit troops originally stationed in Nanjing also fled south in a swarm. They seized cars, horse-drawn carriages, and pedicabs along the way, grabbing whatever transportation they could find. From Xiaguan to Zhongshan Road and Linsen Road, the roads were jammed with a chaotic mass of people, horses, and vehicles. Everyone pushed and shoved forward, fighting and cursing. Everything deemed cumbersome was abandoned, with shoes, coats, luggage, ammunition, and supplies scattered everywhere. They looted along the way. Everything that could be taken from the Presidential Palace on Linsen Road was taken. Telephones and desk lamps were smashed on the ground, and documents and forms were scattered all over. The fleeing soldiers even tore down the portrait of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek that originally hung in the center of the auditorium and threw it into the gutter.

The last train to leave Nanjing was crowded with bandit troops clinging to the roof and carriages. When the train reached Zhenjiang, it was intercepted by the People's Liberation Army. The bandit gang, retreating along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Road, continued their terrifying chaos. Gunfire from mutual robbery and infighting among the bandit gangs was incessant on the road from Qilinmen in Nanjing to Tangshan. The 28th Army of the bandit troops opened fire on the Nanjing puppet police局. A car originally filled with police officers was soon approached by a group of soldiers who drove the police out and took their place. Not long after, an officer with his guards drove the soldiers out and took their place with his family. At this moment, the sound of the People's Liberation Army's pursuit was heard, and the officer jumped out of the car, ignoring his wife and children, and squeezed into the fleeing soldiers on foot. Many cars frantically crashed into the crowd of vehicles and people, crushing many to death, and many cars were damaged in collisions. From Nanjing to Jurong, the roads were littered with abandoned and wrecked vehicles.

The walls, doors, telephone poles, and abandoned cars along the roads were covered with chalk writings seeking units and wives. "Fang Zhen's company, proceed to Hangzhou immediately," "XX Company, assemble in Yixing," "Wife Fengjuan, I don't have time to wait for you, come find me in Hangzhou! Ni."

The towns and villages along the way were continuously looted by waves of Kuomintang fleeing soldiers. In Nanduzhen, west of Liyang, a total of more than 25,000 shi of rice were looted on the 24th and 25th. All the shops and shoe stores were emptied, and the taverns not only had their wine drunk dry, but their wine vats were also smashed. At the time, it was raining continuously, and the even more disheveled bandit gang robbed all 400+ umbrellas from an umbrella shop. The bandits extorted gold and silver everywhere, refusing to take gold yuan notes. They said: These bills are only good for wiping your ass. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, a group of bandits were still looting. When the sound of the People's Liberation Army's guns rang out, they threw down everything and ran. The people both liked and complained to the People's Liberation Army, saying: "If you had arrived an hour earlier, our town would have suffered much less loss!"

The People's Liberation Army relentlessly pursued forward despite the torrential rain. The fleeing bandit gang had completely disintegrated. They even abandoned the vehicles, artillery, ammunition, documents, and baggage they had saved, even discarding their most cherished mahjong tiles, playing cards, and their concubines' lipstick, perfume, and stockings. On the afternoon of the 26th, the People's Liberation Army caught up with a group of fleeing bandits on the line from Nanduzhen to Liyang. At the sound of the People's Liberation Army's guns, many Kuomintang soldiers threw down their guns and said, "Good, surrendering our guns means liberation." In just one hour, a regiment of the People's Liberation Army captured more than 10,000 enemies.

Among the crowds of prisoners, there were soldiers from the Kuomintang's 28th Army, 45th Army, and 4th Army, as well as personnel from the puppet Ministry of National Defense. This group could form a small Nanjing.

    京杭道上的一群丧家狗
    人民解放军在上月二十日发起渡江作战后，南京的国民党匪帮高级官员就最后一次疯狂地抢购黄金、银元、外汇，争坐飞机，火车逃命。二十二日，在解放军隆隆的炮声中，浦口的国民党匪军纷纷从江北向南岸下关溃逃下来。他们等不及船靠岸，就跳下水去爬到岸上向南奔逃。唯恐被解放军赶上的国民党匪军都不顾留在江北的匪军把到达南岸的船烧了。原来驻守南京的国民党匪军各部也都一窝蜂地向南逃窜。他们沿途抓汽车，抓马车、抓三轮车，有什么交通工具就抓什么。从下关到中山路、林森路，一路都被乱作一团的人、马、车挤得水泄不通。大家向前挤冲，争夺，叫骂，撕打。所有一切觉得累赘的东西都被抛弃着，到处是皮鞋、大衣、行李、弹药、辎重。他们沿路洗劫。林森路上的总统府里一切能随身带去的东西都拿去了。各处的电话，台灯被摔在地上，文件、表册散弃满地。溃兵们并把原来挂在大礼堂正中的蒋匪介石的画像，拆下来扔到了阴沟里。
    最后一列从南京开出的火车，车顶车厢都攀满了匪军。这列车开到镇江时就被解放军截住了，沿着京杭国道溃退的匪帮继续着可怕的混沌。从南京麒麟门到汤山的路上匪帮们互相劫夺火并的枪声不绝。匪军二十八军与南京伪警察局开了火。有一辆汽车原来装着警察，走不远，一群士兵追来把警察赶下，自己坐了上去。不一会，带着卫兵的军官又把士兵赶下，带着一家大小坐了上去。这时解放军追击的枪声响了，军官又跳下车子，顾不上老婆孩子的挤进徒步的溃兵中奔跑。许多车子在车群中，人群中疯狂地冲撞着，许多人被压死，许多车子互相撞坏，从南京到句容，道上沿路都是被遗弃和撞坏的车辆。
    公路两旁的墙上，门板上，电线杆上，以及遗弃在路旁的汽车上，到处涂满了寻部队、找老婆的粉笔字。“方震连速开杭州”，“××连到宜兴集合”，“凤娟妻，来不及等你了，到杭州来找我吧！倪。”
    沿途的城镇村庄，连续被一批批的国民党溃兵洗劫着。溧阳以西的南渡镇在二十四、五两日被掠去大米共二万五千多石。所有的货店、鞋店都被抢得干干净净，酒店不仅酒被喝光，酒缸也被砸了。当时正连日下雨，更加狼狈的匪帮就把一家伞店的四百多把伞全部抢光。匪徒们到处勒索金银，不要金圆卷。他们说：这个票子只能擦屁股了。当解放军赶到时，一批匪军还正在抢劫。当解放军的枪声一响，他们都把所有的东西扔下就跑。老百姓又喜欢又埋怨着解放军说：“你们要早到一个钟头多好，我们镇上可以少受多少损失！”
    解放军不顾大雨滂沱猛烈地向前追击着。奔逃的匪帮已完全溃不成军了。他们还把保存下的车辆、大炮、弹药、文件、衣包统统扔下了，连最舍不得的麻将牌、扑克牌和姨太太的口红、香水、吊袜带也都抛弃了。二十六日下午，解放军在南渡镇至溧阳一线追上了一批逃匪。解放军的枪声响处，许多国民党的士兵都把枪一丢说：“好了，缴了枪就解放了。”仅仅一小时内，解放军一个团就俘虏了敌人一万多人。
    成群的俘虏中，有国民党二十八军的，有四十五军和第四军的，有伪国防部这批人合起来，可以组织一个小南京。
