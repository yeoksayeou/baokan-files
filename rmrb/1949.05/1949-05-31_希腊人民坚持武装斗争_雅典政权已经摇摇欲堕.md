The Greek People Persist in Armed Struggle
    The Athens Regime is Tottering
    Recently, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union held talks on the Greek issue. According to a TASS statement on the 19th, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rusk and British Minister of State McNeil met with Soviet Representative to the United Nations Gromyko on April 26th and suggested informally discussing measures to regularize the situation in Greece and end the civil war. Gromyko stated that the Soviet government would not refuse if the U.S. and Britain suggested Soviet participation in ending the Greek civil war and establishing peace. Gromyko believed that the recent peace declaration of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government should be utilized in regularizing the situation in Greece. Gromyko put forward five concrete suggestions: representatives of all countries should call on both sides to cease fire, announce a general amnesty, hold free general elections, the highest electoral body should include representatives of Greek democratic forces, countries including the Soviet Union should supervise the elections, and a joint committee including the Soviet Union should be organized to control the Greek border. He also stated that military assistance to the Athens government must be declared stopped and foreign troops must withdraw from Greece within a time limit during the implementation of control. The British Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department issued statements on the 20th rejecting the Soviet proposal.
    Following the orders of their U.S. and British masters, the Greek reactionaries continue to implement bloody repression against democrats. Arrests and massacres of trade union leaders are endless. In recent days, another seven thousand Macedonians have been persecuted. But all this is only a manifestation of the weakness of the Athens regime and its Anglo-American masters. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Greek people, with unyielding heroism, have severely attacked the American-equipped Greek royalist fascist army directly commanded by U.S. and British officers. In the first four months of this year alone, the Greek Democratic Army wiped out one-fifth of the total number of Greek royalist fascist troops equipped by the United States and Britain, a total of 30,500 people. In the royalist fascist-controlled areas, democratic struggles against terror and for survival have risen one after another. Prisoners in the Athens Averoff prison have announced a hunger strike, and the nationwide strike of civil servants continues to persist. As long as the Greek people persist in their struggle to the end, they will shatter the dreams of U.S. and British imperialism to enslave the Greek people by relying on the tottering Athens regime and seize Greece as a bridgehead for attacking the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe. The Soviet government's announcement of its attitude toward the Greek issue will undoubtedly be an encouragement to the Greek people's cause of liberation and the final struggle for peace.

### 希腊人民坚持武装斗争  雅典政权已经摇摇欲堕

　　希腊人民坚持武装斗争
    雅典政权已经摇摇欲堕
    最近苏美英三国间曾就希腊问题举行过一次谈话。据塔斯社十九日所发表的声明称，美助理国务卿鲁斯克与英国务大臣麦克纳尔曾于四月二十六日与苏驻联合国代表葛罗米柯会晤，建议非正式讨论使希腊情势纳入正规及停止内战等措施。葛罗米柯表示，如美英建议苏联参与停止希腊内战及建立和平，苏联政府并不拒绝。葛罗米柯认为：在使希腊情势纳入正规时，应该利用希腊临时民主政府最近的和平声明。葛罗米柯提出由各国代表呼吁双方停战，宣布普遍大赦，举行自由的普选，最高选举机构中应包括希腊民主力量代表，包括苏联在内的各国对选举实行监督及组织包括苏联在内的联合委员会管制希腊边境等五项具体建议；并声明：在实施管制时，对雅典政府军事授助必须宣布停止，外国军队必须限期自希境撤退。英外部与美国务院于二十日声明拒绝了苏联建议。
    希腊反动派秉承其美英主子的命令对于民主分子继续实行血腥的高压，逮捕和屠杀职工会领袖的事，层出不穷，最近数日又有七千名马其顿人遭受迫害。但是这一切只是雅典政权及其英美主人脆弱的表现，希腊人民在共产党领导之下，以不屈的英勇斗争，痛击了美英帝国主义及其爪牙。仅在本年头四个月中，希腊民主军就歼灭了由美英军官直接指挥的美械装备的希腊保皇法西斯军总数的五分之一，即三万零五百人。在保皇法西斯的统治区内，反恐怖、争生存的民主斗争彼伏此起，雅典阿维罗夫监狱囚犯宣布绝食，公务员全国性罢工继续坚持中。只要希腊人民坚持不渝地斗争到底，必将使美英帝国主义妄图依靠摇摇欲堕的雅典政权奴役希腊人民并夺取希腊作为进攻东南欧新民主国家的难头阵地的迷梦归于粉碎。苏联政府对希腊问题态度的宣布，无疑地将是对希腊人民解放事业与最后争取和平的斗争的一个鼓励。
