Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th: As the Kuomintang bandit troops on the south bank of the Yangtze River flee southward, they are carrying out rampant burning, killing, looting, and raping. In many towns and villages along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway, chickens, pigs, rice, and clothing have all been plundered, with feathers and pigskins scattered everywhere. The doors of civilian homes are wide open, and chests and cabinets are in disarray. The Kuomintang bandit troops of the 28th Army, originally stationed in Nanjing, seized a large number of students from the Frontier College before fleeing, forcing them to carry heavy machine guns. They carried them for a full eight days, and many students were beaten and cursed by the bandit troops along the way because they couldn't carry them. They were later rescued by the People's Liberation Army. The Kuomintang bandit troops of the 21st Army in Jiangyin set fire to an ammunition depot in Zhangjiachang, north of Jiangyin, on April 22nd before fleeing. The fire spread, and more than 100 shops and civilian houses nearby were burned down. Li Baichuan, the commander of the Kuomintang bandit troops' city defense in Suzhou, and Gu Xijiu, the commander of the 123rd Army, shot and killed 17 residents on the charge of being "political prisoners." They also burned down warehouse No. 136 of the "Combined Logistics Headquarters" in the northwest of Pingmen, Suzhou, and more than 60 houses full of military supplies. The bandit troops fleeing from Changxing forcibly seized a large number of civilians to carry the looted property. Many of the conscripted laborers cried when they saw that the things they were carrying were their own. When the People's Liberation Army annihilated a part of the bandit 57th Army northwest of Changxing, they rescued more than 200 civilians who had been seized. The bandit troops fleeing along the Xiaofeng-Hangzhou highway robbed all the shops in places like Gangkou Town, Baishigang, Huanghu Town, and Shuangxi Town, even stripping the clothes and shoes off the residents' bodies. On the doors of the shops that had been robbed in Shuangxi Town, it was written, "This shop is empty, no need to enter again." The bandit troops also collectively raped seven young women in Baishigang and Junmen Village. The bandit troops fleeing from Guangde robbed all the cloth and general merchandise from more than 40 shops in Zhuangyuan Lane, the most prosperous commercial street in the city, including Fuhua Trading Company, Huaxing Trading Company, Tongfengchang Cloth Shop, and Yongda Cloth Shop. The property of residents in other places such as South Street and West Street was also mostly looted. According to preliminary statistics, the total loss of property in the city is estimated to be worth 100,000 shi of rice, and more than 300 civilians were seized. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the above-mentioned areas, they helped the residents clean their houses, tidy up their homes, and publicized the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army to them. The people then accused the soldiers of the Kuomintang bandit troops' atrocities and demanded that the People's Liberation Army take revenge for them.

    【新华社南京九日电】长江南岸的国民党匪军在向南溃逃时，大肆烧杀掳掠、奸淫。京沪路沿线许多城镇村庄，鸡、猪、大米、衣服悉被抢光，鸡毛猪皮狼藉，民家门户洞开，箱柜零乱。原住南京的国民党匪军二十八军，在逃窜前，曾抓走大批边疆学院学生，强迫他们扛抬重机枪，足足抬了八天，许多学生因抬不动，一路上受尽匪军打骂，后为解放军救出。江阴国民党匪军二十一军，四月二十二日临逃前，将江阴北关章家场的一个军火库纵火，火势蔓延。附近一百多家店铺和民房都被烧光。苏州匪军城防司令厉百川和一二三军军长顾锡九以“政治犯”罪名枪杀居民十七人，并将苏州平门西北“联勤总部”一三六号库仓和满储军用品的房屋六十多间悉数烧毁。从长兴逃走的匪军强抓大批市民挑担抢来的财物，许多被抓的壮丁看到所挑的是自己的东西，都大哭起来。解放军在长兴西北歼灭匪五十七军一部时，就解救了被抓的老百姓二百多人。沿孝丰至杭州公路溃逃的匪军，将港口镇、白石港、黄湖镇、双溪镇等地商店全部抢光，连居民们身上穿的衣服、鞋子也被剥下。双溪镇被抢光的店门上，还写着“此店已空，毋须再入。”匪军们又将白石港、军门村七个青年妇女集体轮奸。逃离广德的匪军，曾把该城商业最繁荣的状元巷中的复华商号、华兴商号、同丰昌布号、永大布号等四十多家店铺内的布匹、广货、全部抢光；其他南大街、西大街等处居民财物也多遭洗劫。据初步统计，全城损失财物约值大米十万石，被抓走市民三百多人。解放军解放上述各地后，帮助居民打扫房屋，整理家务，并向他们宣传解放军的三大纪律八项注意，民众便纷纷向战士们控诉国民党匪军暴行，要求解放军为他们报仇。
