　　Ping City Water Company
  　Establishes Factory Management Committee
    [This Newspaper] The Management Committee of the Ping City Water Company was formally established yesterday (the 23rd). The participants in the Management Committee include worker representatives Liu Guisheng and six others, Trade Union Chairman and Vice-Chairman Li Guorui and Liu Zhendong, Manager Liu Zhenfu, Engineer Xu Min, Military Representative Sha Mingjin, and three water plant directors Xu Daben, Zhang Dinghua, and Tao Chuo, totaling fifteen people. Before its establishment, the company's trade union had mobilized various employee groups to deliberate and discuss. Regarding the qualifications of representatives, everyone believed that they must be loyal to the people's water utility, familiar with the business, have not engaged in reactionary activities in the past, have prestige among the workers, and be able to accept everyone's opinions, etc. Subsequently, each group separately elected candidates, who then competed for the positions, formally electing worker representatives to participate in the Management Committee. Worker representatives are re-elected every six months. At the inaugural meeting, issues such as how to implement this year's production plan and how to revise the company's old rules and regulations were raised as topics for the next meeting (the 29th). At the end of the meeting, Director Mou of the Municipal Enterprise Bureau gave detailed instructions on the specific division of labor for the members of the Management Committee, the plant director responsibility system, and the specific tasks of the standing committee.
