　　The Nanjing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Nanjing People's Municipal Government convened a forum on the 18th with more than 50 representatives from the city's industrial and commercial sectors to hear their opinions on the restoration and development of industry and commerce. First, Director Liu Bocheng of the Military Control Commission delivered a speech, pointing out that the People's Liberation War is nearing its final victory, and restoring and developing production, transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, will become the central task of building a new China in the future. Director Liu said that this is a very arduous and glorious task. Especially for a city like Nanjing, because it was the center of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it had a huge and bloated bureaucratic structure, thus forming a deformed consumer city. Now that the reactionary institutions have collapsed, a large number of unemployed people need to be resettled. To solve this problem, we can only rely on restoring and developing production. Director Liu pointed out that "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" is the economic program of New Democracy. In order to implement this economic program, we must take into account all aspects of public and private, labor and capital, urban and rural areas, and domestic and foreign affairs. Director Liu emphasized that if any of the above relationships are not handled correctly, it will be detrimental to production and development. Director Liu finally said that there are difficulties in the road ahead for restoring and developing Nanjing's production and construction, especially in the situation where the war has not yet ended and the countryside has suffered long-term damage from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and there are difficulties in raw materials, manufacturing, sales, and transportation. We must fully estimate these difficulties and gradually seek reasonable solutions. Director Liu said that the Communists are responsible to the people and welcome and accept the opinions and criticisms of the people. The task of developing production in Nanjing is before us. As long as everyone thinks of more ways and takes responsibility, we can accomplish this task.

　　In the speeches of the representatives present, many people talked about the new situation in Nanjing's industrial production after liberation, which is completely different from the Kuomintang rule. For example, due to the government's care for fuel supply, the daily power generation of the Nanjing Power Plant has increased from 16,000 degrees to 26,000 degrees. The director of Youheng Flour Mill further used the resumption of work in the factory to illustrate the industrial prospects under the government's economic policies. He said: "After the liberation of the city, Youheng Factory had neither funds nor raw materials. After the state-owned trading company solved the difficulties of funds and raw materials by placing orders, it now produces 2,000 bags per day, which has not happened in the past six months. After the new wheat is on the market, it can be restored to a production of 8,000 bags per day." The director of Yongli Chemical Plant said: "Under the rule of the Kuomintang, Yongli has been subjected to both internal and external pressure since it was established. When the British wanted to invest, we disagreed, and they openly said: 'There is a way to prevent you from opening the door, and we will overwhelm you as soon as you start work!' When the bureaucratic capital wanted to cooperate, we did not recognize it, and they gave you a lot of difficulties." Wang Baohe, an engineer at Zhongguang Chemical Plant, also said: "The Kuomintang could allocate 20 tons of coal to a police chief every month, but a chemical plant was only given five tons, and it had to be obtained with bribes." The manager of Shanghai Department Store said: "In the past, when the Kuomintang invited us, they wanted us to pay money. Today, the government invites us to discuss the development of industry and commerce. We must convey the spirit of today's meeting to the city's merchants." Regarding the future restoration of industrial opinions, representatives of Yongli Chemical Plant, Zhongguang Chemical Plant, and other factories have requested the government to provide assistance. The director of the Qingdao Yongyu Salt Industry Company's office in Nanjing proposed that it is necessary to focus on the countryside and supply farmers with necessities in order to make Nanjing prosper. Finally, Deputy Director Song Renqiong of the Military Control Commission spoke, expressing welcome to the opinions raised by everyone. He also pointed out that as long as our urban production can be combined with more than 80% of the farmers and meet the needs of the vast rural areas, the prosperity of the city can be expected. As long as it is beneficial to more than 90% of the people, the profits of industry and commerce are guaranteed, and we must make long-term plans for developing production in the future.

　　Building a new Nanjing requires a large number of scientific talents.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 25th:

　　In order to rapidly develop the cultural and scientific construction of Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Nanjing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government invited people from the cultural, educational, and scientific circles of Nanjing to a forum at the Municipal Government on the afternoon of the 16th of this month. More than 40 people, including Liang Xi, Tao Menghe, Wu Yifang, Fang Guangtao, and Xu Jie, attended. First, General Liu Bocheng, Director of the Military Control Commission, explained that Nanjing was originally a place of flourishing culture and relics, but under the 22 years of reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, it has developed into a deformed consumer city. Now, to carry out production and construction in such a city and transform the consuming Nanjing into a producing Nanjing is a very arduous task. Whether in natural science or social science, a large number of talents are needed. Then everyone spoke freely, and the speakers expressed their joy at the liberation of Nanjing and their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army. Tao Menghe said: To build a new democratic China, we must strive for talents and cultivate talents. Xiong Zirong said: We hope that the cultural circles will be mobilized to serve the construction of New Democracy. Wu Baosan said: Chinese intellectuals must serve the people and learn from the intellectuals after the Soviet revolution. Wu Zuxiang advocated that major middle schools and universities hold more lectures and invite progressive scholars who have a clear understanding to speak. Sun Enqing hoped that intellectuals could learn the spirit of hard work of the People's Liberation Army.

Students must combine with workers and peasants and unite theory with practice
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 25th:

　　The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Nanjing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army, and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government jointly invited more than 120 student representatives from major middle schools and universities in the city to a forum at the Overseas Chinese Hotel on the afternoon of the 15th to solicit students' opinions on Nanjing's cultural construction. Song Renqiong, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission, first stood up and delivered a speech, praising the heroic struggle of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the years, and encouraged students to combine with workers and peasants and shoulder the heavy responsibility of building a new China. Student representatives from various schools spoke successively, unanimously expressing their determination to strive for the construction of a new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically put forward the requirements for studying revolutionary theory and reforming the education system. After the student representatives spoke, Deputy Mayor Ke Qingshi gave a detailed explanation on the reform of school curricula and the issue of public and private schools, and pointed out: "Today's schools are institutions for our new democratic cultural construction, and we must establish order and discipline in schools to ensure students' study and life, and do not misunderstand the meaning of liberation." Finally, Director Liu Bocheng spoke, he called on students to take serving the people as the purpose of learning, and to create useful talents by unifying theory and practice and combining learning and application.

　　南京军管会等
    邀请各界座谈
  　听取建设新南京意见
    恢复发展生产，要照顾四方八面。
    【新华社南京二十六日电】人民解放军南京军管会、中共南京市委会、南京人民市政府，于十八日召集全市工商业界五十余代表举行座谈会，听取他们对恢复和发展工商业的意见。首由军管会刘伯承主任致词，他指出人民解放战争已经接近最后胜利，恢复和发展生产，变农业国为工业国，将成为今后建设新中国的中心任务。刘主任说，这是一个十分艰巨而光荣的任务。特别象南京这样的城市，由于它是国民党反动派统治的中心，过去有庞大臃肿的官僚机构，因而形成为畸形的消费城市。现在反动机构垮台了，留下大批失业者须要安置。要解决这个问题，就只有靠恢复与发展生产。刘主任指出“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”是新民主主义的经济纲要。为了要执行这个经济纲要，就必须照顾到公私、劳资、城乡、内外的四方八面。刘主任强调指出对上述任何一种关系处理得不正确，便会有害于生产和发展。刘主任最后说，恢复发展南京的生产建设，在前进道路上是存在着困难的，特别是在战争还未结束，农村曾长期遭受国民党反动统治的破坏的情形，原料、制造、销路、交通等方面都有困难，对这些困难，我们必须作充分估计，逐渐地求得合理解决。刘主任说共产党人是对人民负责的，是欢迎和接受人民的意见和批评的，南京市发展生产的任务，摆在我们的面前，只要大家多想办法，负起责任来做，我们是能够完成这一任务的。
    在到会代表们的发言中，许多人谈到南京解放后的工业生产，已出现了较国民党统治时完全不同的新景象。如南京发电厂由于人民政府照顾燃料供应，日夜发电已由一万六千度增加到二万六千度。有恒面粉厂厂长，更以该厂的复工，来说明在人民政府经济政策下的工业前途。他说：“有恒厂在本市解放后，既无资金又无原料，经公营贸易公司以定货方式解决资金原料困难后，现在日出二千袋，这是半年来没有的情形，新麦登场后，就可以恢复到日出八千袋的产量。”永利化学厂厂长说：“在国民党统治下，永利自开厂以来，就内外受气。英国要投资，我们不同意，他们就公开说：‘有办法不准你开门，你一动工就压倒你！’官僚资本要合伙，我们不承认，他就给你很多留难。”仲光化学厂工程师王葆和也说：“国民党每月可以配给一个警察长二十吨煤，但一个化学厂却只给五吨，而且还得用贿赂才能得到。上海百货公司经理说：“往日国民党请我们，是要我们出钱，今天人民政府请我们，则是要商量发展工商业。我们要把今天开会的精神，转告全市商民。”对于今后恢复工业的意见，永利化学厂、仲光化学厂等厂代表都要求人民政府给以帮助。青岛永裕盐业公司驻京办事处主任提出必须着眼农村，供应农民以必需品，才能使南京繁荣起来。最后军管会宋任穷副主任讲话，对大家所提意见表示欢迎。他并指出：只要我们城市生产，能与百分之八十以上的农民结合，适应广大农村的需要，城市的繁荣是可以期待的。只要对百分之九十以上的人民有利，工商业的利润是有保障的，我们今后要在发展生产上，作长期打算。
    建设新南京，需要大量科学人材。
    【新华社南京二十五日电】为迅速展开南京市文化科学建设，中国共产党南京市委会、中国人民解放军南京市军管会、南京市人民政府曾于本月十六日下午在市府邀请南京文化界教育界科学界人士举行座谈会，到有梁希、陶孟和、吴贻芳、方光焘、许杰等四十余人。首由军管会主任刘伯承将军说明：南京原为文物繁盛之地，但在蒋介石集团二十二年的反动统治下，已发展为畸形的消费城市，现在要在这样一个城市中进行生产建设，把消费的南京变为生产的南京，是一个很艰巨的工作，无论是自然科学或社会科学方面，都需要大量的人材。继由大家自由发言，发言者都表示对南京解放的欢欣和对人民解放军的感谢。陶孟和说：建设新民主主义的中国，就要争取人材，培养人材。熊子容说：盼望文化界总动员，为新民主主义的建设服务。巫宝三说：中国的知识分子，要为人民大众服务，要向苏联革命后的知识分子学习。吴组湘主张各大中学多举行讲座，请认识清楚的进步的学者来演讲。孙恩庆希望知识分子能学习解放军的吃苦精神。
    学生要与工农结合要理论与实践统一
    【新华社南京二十五日电】中国共产党南京市委会、人民解放军南京军管会及南京市人民政府于十五日下午联合邀请全市各大中学学生代表一百二十余人，假华侨招待所举行座谈会，征求学生方面对南京文化建设的意见。军管会副主任宋任穷首先起立致词，对多年来国民党统治区学生的英勇斗争备致赞扬，勉励学生与工农结合，担当建设新中国的重任。各校学生代表相继发言，一致表示决心在毛主席领导下为建设新中国而奋斗，并热烈提出学习革命理论和改革教育制度的要求。学生代表发言后，柯庆施副市长对改革学校课程与公私立学校问题作详尽的说明，并指出：“今天的学校是我们新民主主义文化建设的机构，必须建立学校的秩序与纪律，以保障同学的学习生活，不要把解放的意义误解了。”最后刘伯承主任讲话，他号召学生要以为人民服务为学习的目的，要以理论与实践一致、学与用结合，去造就成为有用的人才。
