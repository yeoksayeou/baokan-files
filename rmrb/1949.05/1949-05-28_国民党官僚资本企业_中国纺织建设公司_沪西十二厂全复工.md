　　National Government Bureaucratic Capital Enterprise: China Textile Construction Company
　　All Twelve Factories in Western Shanghai Resume Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] After the liberation of Shanghai, all twelve factories of the China Textile Construction Company, a National Government bureaucratic capital enterprise in western Shanghai, have resumed production and are awaiting takeover. Only the Fifth Cotton Mill on Fan Wang Du Road suffered slight damage due to the intense tremors of the war and is awaiting repair. Among the factories that have resumed production, there are several types of machinery, including cotton spinning, wool spinning, and hemp manufacturing. Sixty percent of other cotton mills in Shanghai have already started operating. The Wing On Textile Factory, with the exception of the Second and Fourth factories in the Wusong area whose situation is unclear, the other three factories have not stopped production before or after liberation. The three factories of the Shenxin Textile Factory and the two factories of the Xinyu Textile Factory are also operating as usual.

  　沪西十二厂全复工
    【新华社北平二十七日电】上海市区解放后，国民党官僚资本企业中国纺织建设公司沪西各厂已有十二厂全部复工，并静候接收。只有梵王渡路第五棉纺厂因受战争的激烈震动，稍受损坏，尚待修理。已复工各厂中，有棉纺、毛纺、制麻机械等数种。沪市其他棉织厂已有十分之六开工。永安纱厂，除在吴淞地区的第二、第四两厂情况不明外，其他三个厂，在解放前后，均未停工。申新纱厂的三个厂及新裕纱厂的二个厂，也照常开工。
