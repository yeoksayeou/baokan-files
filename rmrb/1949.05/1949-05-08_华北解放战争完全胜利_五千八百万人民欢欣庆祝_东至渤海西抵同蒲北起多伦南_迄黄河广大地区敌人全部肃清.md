[Special Dispatch] A Xinhua News Agency North China Branch reporter summarized the victorious conclusion of the North China People's Liberation War, stating: The 58 million people of North China are elated and celebrating the complete liberation of North China. Now, in the vast territory of the North China Liberated Area, east to the Bohai Sea, west to Tongpu, north from Dolon, and south to the Yellow River, all enemy armed forces have been eliminated. In the twelve days from April 24th to May 6th, Taiyuan, Datong, Xinxiang, and Anyang, which had been heavily besieged by the military and civilians of the Liberated Area for a long time, were all liberated. 120,000 enemy troops were annihilated or surrendered and laid down their weapons to accept reorganization. The People's Liberation War in the North China region has now achieved a complete and thorough victory.

Taiyuan was entrenched by the bandit Yan Xishan for nearly forty years and was one of the important reactionary strongholds of the Chiang-Yan bandit gang in North China, as well as one of China's leading industrial cities. Japanese invaders and Yan bandits had permanent fortifications of steel and concrete in Taiyuan, with more than 3,000 bunkers of various types. In order to spare the hundreds of thousands of people of Taiyuan from the scourge of war, the People's Liberation Army repeatedly advised the defending enemy to lay down their weapons, but were rejected by the Yan bandits. The People's Liberation Army then launched a general offensive on the city walls on the morning of the 24th, and after five hours of fierce fighting, annihilated all 84,000 defending enemies. With the exception of the chief bandit Yan Xishan, who fled alone before our general offensive, the rest were captured. The victory in Taiyuan was so resounding that within less than ten days, the defending enemy in Datong surrendered without a fight. All 13,000 men laid down their weapons and left the city to accept reorganization by our army. Datong, an important military town and transportation and economic center in northern Shanxi, was thus peacefully liberated. In the two campaigns, nearly 100,000 enemies were annihilated and surrendered, finally ending the Yan bandits' nearly forty years of reactionary rule in Shanxi. The 20,000 defending enemies in Xinxiang, intimidated by the victorious power of our army, surrendered completely on the 5th. The 10,000 defending enemies in Anyang vainly attempted to continue their stubborn resistance, but were completely annihilated after only one and a half hours of general offensive on the 6th. Xinxiang and Anyang were the ruling centers of feudal forces, bandits, and local tyrants in northern Henan. When the Kuomintang bandit gang launched the anti-people civil war in 1947, they used these two cities as forward bases, attempting to advance north along the Pinghan Railway to spy on Handan, and to collude east and west along the Daocing Railway to commit crimes in the Ji-Lu-Yu and Taihang regions. Their arrogant conspiracy was shattered by the People's Liberation Army. Later, they shrank back into the city, waiting for their doom, and now they have finally received the punishment they deserve.

The liberation of the above four cities was the last battle in the North China Liberation War. The facts once again prove that the People's Liberation Army is now so powerful that it is invincible and can conquer wherever it strikes, and can quickly capture wherever it wants to. The facts also prove that the Kuomintang bandit troops in other parts of the country now have only two paths to take: either lay down their weapons and resolve the issue peacefully, which is their best way out; or stubbornly resist to the end and be completely annihilated, the result of which is only death.

    华北解放战争完全胜利
    五千八百万人民欢欣庆祝
    东至渤海西抵同蒲北起多伦南  迄黄河广大地区敌人全部肃清
    【本报特讯】新华社华北总分社记者综述华北人民解放战争胜利结束称：华北五千八百万人民，欢欣鼓舞，庆祝华北完全解放。现华北解放区东至渤海，西抵同蒲，北起多伦，南迄黄河的广大土地上，所有敌人的武装力量都已肃清。从上月二十四日至本月六日的十二天内，长期被解放区军民重重包围的太原、大同、新乡、安阳均告解放，敌军十二万人被歼灭或投降放下武器接受改编，华北地区的人民解放战争，至此乃获得完全、彻底的胜利。
    太原被阎匪锡山盘踞近四十年，为蒋阎匪帮在华北的重要反动堡垒之一，又是中国有数的工业城市。日寇及阎匪在太原有钢骨水泥的永久性工事，各种碉堡达三千余座。解放军为使太原数十万人民免于战祸，曾多次劝告守敌放下武器，均遭阎匪拒绝。解放军乃于二十四日晨向城垣发起总攻，经五小时激战，即将守敌八万四千人全部歼灭。匪首除阎逆锡山在我总攻前只身逃逸外，余均就擒。太原胜利声威所至，未及旬日，大同守敌亦不战而降，万三千人全部放下武器，出城接受我军改编。晋北军事重镇，交通与经济中心的大同城，遂告和平解放。两役被歼敌及投降的敌人近十万人，最后结束了阎匪在山西近四十年反动的统治。新乡守敌二万人慑于我军胜利声威，于五日全部投降。安阳守敌万人妄图继续顽抗，于六日仅经一小时半总攻，即将其全部歼灭。新乡、安阳为豫北封建势力、土匪、恶霸的统治中心，一九四七年国民党匪帮发动反人民内战时，即以此两城为前进基地。企图沿平汉线北进窥伺邯郸，东西沿道清路窜犯冀鲁豫与太行区，其狂妄阴谋，均为人民解放军所粉碎。后即龟缩城内，坐以待毙，现在终于得到了他们应有的膺惩。
    以上四城的解放为华北地区解放战争中的最后一战。事实再一次证明：现在人民解放军已经强大到无坚不摧，无攻不克，要打那里就能迅速打下那里。事实又证明：全国其他各地国民党匪军现在只有两条路可走了：或放下武器和平解决，这是他们最好的出路；或负隅顽抗全部被歼，其结果只有死亡。
