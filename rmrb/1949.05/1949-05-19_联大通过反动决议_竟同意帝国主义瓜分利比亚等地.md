Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: From Chenggong Lake: After lengthy delays, the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its debate on the issue of former Italian colonies on the 13th. Under the manipulation of the British and American imperialist bloc, it passed the so-called Bevin-Sforza Plan and rejected the Soviet proposals. In the vote on the Bevin-Sforza Plan, 16 countries opposed it, and 7 countries abstained. The former Italian colonies in Africa consisted of three territories: Libya (in North Africa), Eritrea (in East Africa), and Italian Somaliland (in East Africa). According to the Bevin-Sforza Plan, the disposition of the aforementioned three territories is as follows: (1) Libya will be divided into three parts: Cyrenaica (eastern Libya) will be placed under British trusteeship, Fezzan (southwestern Libya) will be placed under French trusteeship, and Tripolitania (northwestern Libya) will be placed under Italian trusteeship after 1951, but will continue to be administered by Britain in the meantime; (2) Eritrea will be incorporated into Abyssinia, except for the western part; (3) Somaliland will be placed under Italian trusteeship. The Soviet proposal regarding the disposition of former Italian colonies, which was rejected by the Political and Security Committee, stipulated that Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland should all be placed under United Nations trusteeship. The trusteeship period for each territory before allowing them independence is: five years for Libya and Eritrea, and ten years for Italian Somaliland. The Soviet proposal also suggested that the Security Council, when it deems necessary, may demarcate any strategic areas in all former Italian colonies that are considered important from the perspective of international security and place them under the administration of the Security Council.

　　联大通过反动决议
  　竟同意帝国主义瓜分利比亚等地
    【新华社北平十七日电】成功湖消息：在长期的拖延之后，联合国大会政治安全委员会于十三日结束关于前意大利殖民地问题的辩论。并在英美帝国主义集团的操纵之下，通过所谓贝文——史佛卓计划，而否决了苏联的建议。在表决贝文——史佛卓计划时，反对者十六国，弃国者七国。意大利前在非洲之殖民地共有三处，即利比亚（在北非）、厄立特里亚（在东非）与意属索马利兰（在东非）。按照贝文——史佛卓计划前述三地之处理方法如下：（一）将利比亚分成三部分，昔兰尼加（利比亚东部）将由英国托管，费赞（利比亚西南部）将由法国托管，的黎波里坦尼亚（利比亚西北部）将于一九五一年以后由意大利托管，目前则仍由英国继续管理；（二）将厄立特里亚并入阿比西尼亚，惟西部除外；（三）索马利兰将由意大利托管。被政治安全委员会所否决的苏联关于处理前意属殖民地的建议则规定：利比亚、厄立特里亚与意属索马利兰，都交由联合国托管。在允许各该地独立以前，各该地的托管时期为：利比亚与厄立特里亚五年，意属索马利兰十年。苏联提案又建议，在安理会认为必要时，可将一切前意属殖民地上从国际安全观点看来认为重要的战略地区划出，交由安理会予以管理。
