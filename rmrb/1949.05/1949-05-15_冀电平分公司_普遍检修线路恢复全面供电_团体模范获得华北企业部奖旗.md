    Universally Overhauls Lines, Restores Full Power Supply
    Group Model Receives Award Banner from North China Enterprise Department
    [Reported by this newspaper] The more than nine hundred employees of the "Jidian" Beiping Branch Company launched a production competition movement in April, completing and exceeding the original production plan for April, urgently repairing nine lines destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, enabling the full restoration of power supply. They also urgently repaired 75 projects including Xiangshan, Chengzicun, and Majiapu, and inspected and repaired all lines and equipment that had not been repaired for a long time. Other aspects such as collecting electricity fees and internal attendance systems have also achieved great results. During the competition, each employee completed their own production tasks with a sense of ownership. When the North City Substation installed the metering device for the North City high-voltage line on April 18, the original plan was five days, but it was completed in two days with a surprise attack. The Qianmen Substation installed the line protection device on April 20. It was originally scheduled to cut off power for half an hour per line, totaling five hours, but the wiring work for ten lines was completed in three hours. On May 10, more than 50 section and unit chiefs and active workers organized a merit evaluation committee, and each work unit organized a merit evaluation group to democratically discuss and select models. By the 12th, most of the exemplary workers in each unit had been selected. After two days of evaluation by the merit evaluation committee, a total of 73 individual models were selected, and the group models were the Line Section of the First-Class Power Supply Section, the Fee Collection Section of the Second-Class Business Section, and the Inspection and Transportation Section of the Third-Class Material Warehouse. There are also general individual and group models that have been commended. In order to reward the production models, the company decided to award each level of model with a medal, in addition to a special prize of 5,000 yuan in People's Currency, and 3,000 yuan for the first prize. Jidian Head Office and the North China Enterprise Department each presented a banner to the group models to commend them. All employees will hold a celebration meeting on May 15 to officially present the awards.
