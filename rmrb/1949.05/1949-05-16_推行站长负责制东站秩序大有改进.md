Following the conclusion of the Pingjin Railway Bureau transportation meeting last month, the Beijing East Railway Station has been diligently implementing the station master responsibility system. Significant improvements have been made in aspects such as station order, cleanliness and hygiene, passenger service, and on-time operation. The East Railway Station is a passenger station, with passenger transport as its main business. Starting from February, the daily passenger flow through the station was approximately 12,000 people. In March, due to the increase in train services, the average daily passenger flow rose to 14,000 people, and in April, it further increased to 16,600 people. The volume of luggage and parcels has also been increasing daily. In February, the daily outbound volume was 20,000 jin, which surged to 40,000 jin in March. Regarding station order, passengers now board and disembark in an orderly queue, avoiding the chaotic phenomenon of passengers rushing and pushing. Since the last transportation meeting, full-time cleaners have been regularly sweeping and cleaning, and all station personnel have been constantly mobilized to participate in cleaning, from the chief station master to the staff, ensuring the cleanliness of the station. The station pays great attention to passenger service and ticket delivery services, charging a handling fee of ten yuan per ticket delivered. Since May 1st, the number of trains has increased from 21 pairs per day to 24 pairs, and then reduced to 21 pairs in mid-May, without any delays. The station's average daily revenue in April was over 1.6 million yuan, and in May it has exceeded 3.5 million yuan. Each ticket window has two staff members, and the fifteen windows operate day and night in shifts, selling out all tickets in one and a half hours. The station has also formulated a work and production increase plan for May of this year: In terms of passenger service, the aim is to increase ticket sales speed, reduce passenger congestion, strive for accurate and clear forms and reports, maintain a kind attitude towards passengers, minimize black market tickets, carefully verify tickets to ensure accuracy, and simplify ticket补票 procedures. Maintain permanent cleanliness inside and outside the station, sprinkle water and sweep, pay attention to passenger hygiene, mobilize all employees to hold regular cleaning sessions, plant flowers and trees outside the station ditches to strive for beauty. Ensure orderly boarding and disembarking, and maintain on-time operation. Accept reasonable suggestions from passengers, maintain the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking, and ensure quick weighing, calculation, and recording of parcels and luggage. Arriving luggage and parcels should be unloaded, received, and dispatched quickly. Strengthen night patrols to protect the safety of passengers' luggage. If luggage is lost after being handed over to the station, the station will be responsible. In terms of transportation: ensure punctual train departures, prepare trains in advance to strive for speed, prevent all transshipment accidents, station staff should not be late or leave early, and rest as much as possible during breaks.
