　　Minister Teng's Full Speech
    Laying a Foundation for Completing the Five-Year Railway Construction Plan and Establishing a National Railway Steel Target of 200,000 Kilometers
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Teng's speech at the Northern Factories Conference:

　　This Northern Factories Conference is the first meeting of major factories in the North since the establishment of the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways. This conference is to lay the groundwork for a future national factories conference to unify the production task plans and various systems of railway factories across the country.

　　With the victorious development of the Chinese People's Liberation War, all departments and staff of our People's Railways must actively produce and work hard to fully support the southward advance of the army and ensure national transportation by striving to exceed production plans and improve work efficiency. At the same time, we should further recognize that the entire country is about to be liberated. Looking ahead, we have even greater railway construction tasks that require greater effort from all departments of our People's Railways, especially the production departments. We must, according to the Military Commission's Five-Year Railway Construction Plan and tasks, establish major trunk lines connecting the east, west, north, and south of the country, and build a railway network of 200,000 kilometers nationwide. This task and plan require more equipment and manpower to complete. The main thing is to lay this foundation from our existing direct production departments and undertake this task. Therefore, all railway factories in the country should become the main force in the current restoration work and future construction work. This requires:

　　1. Improving production efficiency, raising the quality of repairs, and extensively repairing damaged locomotives and rolling stock. According to the tasks assigned by the Ministry of Railways, discuss and study them carefully, analyze your own capabilities, organize your capabilities, formulate production plans, and further improve production efficiency. A large number of heavily damaged locomotives and rolling stock in the North should be revived. There are clear instructions in the tasks for the second half of this year: to complete more than 60 percent of all dead stock in three stages.

　　2. Implementing the factory responsibility system. Various draft production responsibility systems have been formulated at this conference. It is hoped that everyone will discuss and study them carefully. The principles and spirit of this system should be grasped and implemented in the work system of every organizational structure in the factory to fully exert the effectiveness of various technical and business departments.

　　3. Establishing a budget and final accounting system, practicing thrift, improving efficiency, and reducing costs. This is a necessary condition for the enterprise of factories, especially the budget and final accounting system, which is extremely important for reducing costs, practicing thrift, and improving efficiency. In order to make the budget accurate, it is first necessary to have a serious and responsible bottom-up final accounting system, which can establish this true budget and final accounting system.

　　4. In addition to completing a large number of heavily damaged locomotive and rolling stock tasks and the major and medium repair tasks of operating locomotives every month, railway factories should also try their best to organize and plan to adjust all production capacities to mass-produce accessories, repair and manufacture machinery, and manufacture production tools.

　　5. Most of the machinery and boilers in the factories now are old-fashioned, and many of the machines have been in use for many years and lack maintenance. The condition of the machinery is not very good, and the work efficiency is not high. In order to exert the effectiveness of these machines, improve productivity, and complete the tasks assigned by the Ministry of Railways, in addition to immediately implementing the responsibility system for the guaranteed use and maintenance of machinery and tools, each factory should immediately organize a mechanical maintenance shock campaign and study the plan put forward by the Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, take it back and implement it seriously.

    为完成铁路建设五年计划，建立全国廿万公里铁路钢的任务打一基础
    【本报讯】滕部长在北方厂务会议上的讲话：
    这一次北方厂务会议，是军委铁道部成立以来，北方各主要工厂第一次会议，这一次会议是为了打下将来召开全国厂务会议统一全国各铁路工厂生产任务计划及各种制度的工作基础。
    随着中国人民解放战争胜利的发展，我们人民铁路各个部门，全体职工上下一致，要积极生产，努力工作，以全力支援南下大军，保证国家运输为超过生产计划提高工作效率而努力；同时应进一步的看到，全国即将全部解放，引领前瞻，我们还有更伟大的铁路建设任务，需要我们人民铁路各个部门，尤其是生产部门，更大更多的努力；我们必须根据军委给我们的铁路建设五年计划和任务，建立贯通全国东西南北的大干线，在全国建立二十万公里的铁路网。这一任务和计划，需要更多的设备和人力来完成，主要的是从我们现有的直接生产部门打下这一基础，担负这一任务。因此，全国所有铁路工厂，应成为现在复旧工作，将来建设工作的主力军，这就要作到：
    一、提高生产效率，提高修车质量，大量的修复破损机车及客货车辆。按照铁道部所给予的任务，很好的加以讨论研究，如何去分析自己的能力，组织自己的能力，订出生产计划，进一步提高生产效率，应将北方所有大破损机车客货车，大量复活，在今年下半年的任务中已有明确的指示：分三个阶段，完成所有死车百分之六十以上。
    二、贯彻工厂负责制。在此次会议上关于这一工作已制订了各种生产负责制的草案，这些草案，希望大家很好的讨论研究。应掌握这一制度的原则和精神，把他贯彻到工厂中每一个组织机构工作制度中去，以充分发挥各个技术业务部门之效能。
    三、建立预决算制度，厉行节约运动，提高效率，减低成本，这是工厂企业化必备的条件，尤其是预决算制度对于减低成本，厉行节约，发挥效率，极其重要，为了要作到使预算正确，首先就需要认真负责自下而上的决算制度，这才能建立此真正的预决算制度。
    四、铁路工厂除了大量的要完成大破损机车客货车之任务及每月运用机车之大中修任务外，同时要尽量的组织计划调整所有的生产能力，来大量预制配件，修制机械，制造生产工具。
    五、现在各厂的机械及锅炉大部分是旧式的，而且有很多机械大部分已因使用年久，并欠检修，机械之状态都不太好，工作效能不高，为了发挥这些机械的效能，以提高生产率，完成铁道部所给予的任务，各厂应除立即实行机械及工具等包管包用负责制外，应在目前即组织一次机械检修突击运动，按照铁道部机务局所提出之方案加以研究，带回去认真的实施。
