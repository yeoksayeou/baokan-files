Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15th: TASS, Moscow: The News Report published an article by Kudryavtsev on the 13th, commenting on MacArthur's so-called special proclamation issued on the second anniversary of the promulgation of the Japanese Constitution (May 2nd). The author emphasized that MacArthur considered the promulgation of the constitution in 1947 to be his "achievement." But today, in 1949, the Japanese Constitution has become a kind of obstacle to his policy of transforming Japan into an outpost of the United States in the Far East. The provisions granting limited rights and freedoms to the people in the 1947 Japanese Constitution have become a thorn in the side of the American and Japanese reactionaries. Therefore, MacArthur has been paying less and less attention to the constitution, and blatantly violating its provisions. Kudryavtsev cited facts as examples, mentioning that on July 22nd of last year, MacArthur ordered Ashida to deprive workers and staff of state-run and municipal enterprises of the right to strike and sign collective contracts. Violating the constitution, the Japanese Ministry of Labor issued instructions on February 3, 1949, authorizing prefectural governors to dissolve trade union organizations whose members help each other and participate in cultural and political activities. There are many such incidents of deliberately violating the 1947 Constitution. Whenever the Japanese reactionaries refuse to accept the minimal democracy contained in the constitution, the American occupation authorities try their best to encourage them. The author concluded that in his proclamation, MacArthur openly stated that the reason for delaying the resolution of the Japanese issue is that the current U.S. military presence in Japan has nothing to do with occupation purposes, but to use Japan as a springboard against the Soviet Union and against the Asian people who are fighting for the liberation of their motherland. It is impossible for the American occupiers to hide from the Japanese and the people of the world that the Japanese and American reactionaries are jointly taking all possible measures to revive Japanese militarism as a docile tool for the United States to dominate the world.

　　美帝公然宣布利用日本作侵略跳板
  　消息报斥麦克阿瑟文告
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报十三日刊载库德利亚夫切夫的论文，评论麦克阿瑟于日本颁布宪法二周年纪念日（五月二日）所发表的所谓特别文告。作者着重指出：麦克阿瑟在一九四七年认为颁布宪法是他的“功绩”。但在一九四九年的今日，日本宪法已成为他变日本为美国远东前哨政策的某种阻碍。一九四七年日本宪法中给予人民的限权利与自由的条文，今日成了美、日反动派的喉中鲠骨。因此麦克阿瑟已越来越少地考虑宪法，蛮横地违反宪法的规定。库德利亚夫切夫援引事实为例，他举出去年七月二十二日麦克阿瑟命令芦田剥夺国营及市营企业工人、职员罢工及签定集体合同的权利。日本劳工省违反宪法，于一九四九年二月三日公布指示，授权各县长解散组织会员互助及参加文化政治活动的职工会团体。这种故意违犯一九四七年宪法的事件是非常多的。美国占领当局每逢日本反动派拒绝接受载于该宪法中的微乎其微的民主时，便竭力予以鼓励。作者结语称：麦克阿瑟在其文告中解释其拖延解决日本问题的原因时，公然表示目前美军驻日与占领目的无关，而是为了利用日本作为反苏及反对正在为他们祖国的解放而斗争的亚洲人民之跳板。美国占领者要想隐瞒日本与世界人民，不让他们知道日美反动派正联合采取各种可能措施以复活日本军国主义，作为美国称霸世界的驯服的工具，是不可能的了。
