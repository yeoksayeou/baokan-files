    A Day's Work
    Cai Wanjin, Worker at the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau
    -- Diary of April 6th

    The whistle blew, and I hurriedly got up to wash my face in the courtyard. After eating, people wiped their mouths and went to the "Tool and Material Storage" to collect tools and materials. Our "Wiring Group" work was the same as yesterday, still setting up the wires, but with two fewer people -- transferred to the "Line Installation Group." Regardless of how many people were left, our work had to be carried out in a competitive manner. The tools and materials for each group were prepared. When the truck arrived, everyone was busy loading their tools and materials. The "Surveying Group," the "Pole Erection Group," the "Crossarm Installation Group," the "Line Installation Group," the "Wiring Group," and the "Rubber Cable Hanging Group" were all busy at once. In a moment, the tools and materials were loaded, and everyone swarmed onto the truck. With a honk of the horn, the wheels turned, and we embarked on our journey to work. At the work site, the workers in each group worked hard all morning with the drive to win the title of "Model Work Group."
    After returning and eating lunch, there should have been an hour's rest, but the workers in each group were discussing the afternoon's work, forgetting even the rest time. Kangtou from my group and I were discussing the ingenious methods of setting up the wires. Section Chief Zhang came over and said to me: "The wires must be hung up today! You two stay and make the crossover bows this afternoon, and it will all be finished tomorrow." When I heard "finished," I felt very surprised, thinking: "The project, which was expected to take ten days, will be completed in seven days. This is truly an unprecedented achievement, breaking the new record for work." My heart jumped up happily. An hour later, the work truck drove away, and the courtyard was very quiet. Besides Kangtou and me, there was also Comrade Tang Peijin, who was staying at home to sort out the material accounts. After he went into the room to work, Kangtou and I seemed to be in a technical competition, both striving to become "Labor Heroes." The "squeak, squeak, squeak" sound of pliers clamping iron wire could be heard. We two vowed to complete these dozens of crossover bows this afternoon. After Tangtou finished the material accounts, he came out of the room smiling and said to me: "I also want to learn how to make crossover bows." Then he picked up the iron wire and started to do it. At first, he turned the pliers with one hand, but after making three, he learned to turn the pliers with both hands. His learning progress was truly "clever and skillful." We both admired him. The three of us worked and studied together, talking about the use, dimensions, and methods of the crossover. … The dozens of bows were finished, and the sun had not yet sunk behind the Western Hills.
    The workers at the site were brought back by the truck, and the courtyard was bustling again. Everyone washed their faces and ate dinner, and the sun had already set. The scenery near Fragrant Hills was very beautiful. I strolled out the door, feeling very happy. When I returned to the courtyard, I heard joyful singing: "The East is Red, the sun rises…" "You are the lighthouse!" "Unity is strength," … everyone talking at once, a complete mess. I met the old landlord in the courtyard. I said to him: "Look how happy our workers are! They don't feel tired after working all day." The landlord replied: "Hard work is happiness, no hard work, no happiness." His words were very sincere and moving. I kept these two sentences firmly in my heart.
    The sounds in the room quieted down, and the work review meeting began. I said goodbye to the landlord and walked into the room.

    一天的工作
    北平电讯局工人  才万金
    ——四月六日的日记
    汽笛响了，我匆忙的起来到院子里洗脸。吃过饭，人们一抹嘴就到“工具材料保管处”去领工具和材料，我们“拉线组”的工作跟昨天一样还是打拉线，不过减少了两个人——调到“架线组”，不管剩下了几个人，反正我们的工作也是一样要以竞赛方式进行的，各组的工具和材料都预备好了，汽车开过来，大家都忙着装自己的工具和材料，“测量组”的，“立杆组”的，“装担组”的，“架线组”的，“拉线组”的，“扎线组”的，“挂胶皮电缆”的都七手八脚的忙个不停，片刻间，工具材料都装好了，大家都蜂涌的上了车，喇叭一响，车轮转动，就踏向工作的征程，在工作现场里，各组的工友都以争取“工作模范组”的劲头劳累了一上午。
    回来吃过午饭，理应是一小时的休息，然而各组的工友们都在商讨午后的工作，连休息的时间也忘了，我和本组的康头，正商讨着打拉线的巧妙法，张班长走来对我说：“今天线要挂齐啦！下午你们俩人在家做交叉的弓子，明天就都完了。”我一听到“完工”，觉得非常惊疑，心想：“预计十天的工程七天就做完了，真是空前创举，打破工作的新纪录”，心里高兴的“嘟！嘟！”地跳起来，一小时过后工作汽车开走了，院内沉寂的很，除我和康头外，还有唐培金工友，他是留在家里整理材料帐的，他走进屋里去工作以后，我和康头二人好象在做技术竞赛，都要争取“劳动英雄”，但听得“吱吱吱”的钳子夹铁线的声音。我们二人立誓保证要把这几十个交叉弓子在今天下午完成，唐头做完了材料帐。走出屋来笑嘻嘻的对我说：“我也要学习做交叉弓子。”随后就拿起铁线来做，先是一只手转钳子，做过三个之后，就学会用两手转钳子，他的学习真进步真可谓之“心灵手巧”，我们二人都钦佩他。我们三人一边工作，一边研究，说些交叉的用处，尺寸和做法。……几十个弓子做完了，太阳还没有压着西山头。
    在现场的工作工人都给汽车载回来，院子里又是一番热闹，大家洗洗脸，吃过晚饭，太阳已坠山了。香山附近的景象很美丽，我信步走出门来，心里十分愉快。回到院子里，听到欢乐的唱歌声：“东方红，太阳升……”、“你是灯塔！”、“团结就是力量，”……你言我语，乱成一片。我在院内遇见了房东老太爷。我对他说：“您看我们工人多么高兴！工作了一天不知劳累。”房东回答说：“辛苦即是幸福，没有辛苦换不来幸福。”话很恳切，令人动听。我把这两句话牢牢的记在心头。
    屋子里的声音沉静下去了，工作检讨会开始了，我告别了房东走进屋子里。
