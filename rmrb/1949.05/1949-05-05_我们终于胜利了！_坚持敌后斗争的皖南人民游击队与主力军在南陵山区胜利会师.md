    We Have Finally Won!
    The Anhui Southern People's Guerrilla Force, Which Persisted in Fighting Behind Enemy Lines, Triumphantly Joins Forces with the Main Force in the Nanling Mountains
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze Front, 4th] A certain army of the People's Liberation Army triumphantly joined forces with the Anhui Southern People's Guerrilla Force in the northwest mountainous region of Nanling County, southern Anhui, on April 29th. A certain division of the People's Liberation Army, whose predecessor was the New Fourth Army unit that grew and strengthened in the Wanjiang area during the Anti-Japanese War, was the first to meet with the guerrilla force. When they met with the guerrilla brothers who had persisted behind enemy lines in southern Anhui, everyone was very excited and joyful. On the evening of the 22nd, several cadres from the Yanjiang Detachment of the Anhui Southern People's Guerrilla Force, old comrades-in-arms of the director of the division's political department, arrived in the deep of the night. They shook hands tightly with each other, so excited that they didn't know what to say, just repeatedly saying, "We have finally won!" Later, they excitedly chatted late into the night about the situation since they had parted. The People's Guerrilla Force members happily talked about their arduous struggle over the past three years. They said: We persisted in fighting in the mountains, and the common people helped us. We shattered countless enemy "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. Now that the elder brothers have arrived, we will be fine. From now on, it is our turn to "encircle and suppress" the enemy. After obtaining permission from their superiors, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army gifted the guerrilla force with newly captured weapons. This made the guerrilla force members even happier. They said that now that the elder brothers have equipped us, we will surely eliminate even more enemies.

    我们终于胜利了！
    坚持敌后斗争的皖南人民游击队与主力军在南陵山区胜利会师
    【新华社长江前线四日电】人民解放军某军，于四月二十九日在安徽南部南陵县西北山区与皖南人民游击队会师。首先和游击队会面的解放军某师，其前身原是抗日战争中在皖江地区生长壮大的新四军部队。当他们和坚持皖南敌后的游击队弟兄会见时，大家都十分兴奋和欢欣。二十二日晚，该师政治部主任的老战友——皖南人民游击队沿江支队的几个干部，在深夜中找来了。他们互相紧紧地握着手，激动得不知说什么好，只是反复的说着：“我们终于胜利了！”后来竟夜兴奋地畅叙别后情形。人民游击队员都愉快地畅谈他们在三年来艰苦斗争的情形，他们说：我们在山里坚持斗争，老百姓都帮助我们，我们粉碎了敌人无数次清剿。现在老大哥来了，我们就好了。今后是轮到我们清剿敌人的日子了。解放军某部得到上级许可后，赠给了游击队新缴获的武器。这使得游击队员们更加高兴。他们说老大哥装备了我们，我们一定更多地消灭敌人。
