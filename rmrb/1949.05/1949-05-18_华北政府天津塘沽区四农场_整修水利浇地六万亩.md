　　【Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station】 Tianjin, 17th dispatch: The spring water conservancy repair project of the four farms in Junliangcheng and Zhangguizhuang, which belong to the Tianjin Tanggu District Land Reclamation Bureau of the North China People's Government, was completed on April 30th. The original water conservancy facilities of the farms in these two locations were mostly in disrepair for many years, affecting water intake and drainage. After the liberation of the area, the Jin-Gu Land Reclamation Bureau, in order not to delay the farming season and to help farmers with spring plowing and production, organized four engineering shock teams in March to conduct repairs in the two locations. A total of more than 110 li of rivers and canals were dredged, and cement plants and power rooms were repaired and newly built. After the completion of this project, in addition to providing sufficient water for more than 61,800 mu of land, the remaining water can also be used to reclaim more than 6,000 mu of new paddy fields.
