　　The Northeast Workers' Congress of Labor Models Concludes
　　Tianjin-Peiping Railway Bureau and Four Other Delegations Return
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Tianjin-Peiping Railway Bureau and four other delegations, totaling 108 people, who participated in the Northeast Workers' Congress of Labor Models, left Tianjin on April 26th and arrived in Harbin on April 29th. They were warmly welcomed by the vast number of worker brothers. The delegation participated in the May 1st parade of 200,000 workers and the ten-day congress, learning a great deal from the experiences and gains of the Northeast workers' movement over the past three and a half years. After the congress concluded on the 10th, they also visited the famous Harbin Railway Factory. On the 11th, the delegation left Harbin and arrived in Tianjin on the 16th. The representatives from our city returned to Peiping yesterday (the 17th). According to members of the delegation, the high level of labor enthusiasm among Northeast workers is truly rare. Not only have they repaired all the railway bridges and roadbeds destroyed by the Kuomintang, but they have also completed 300 trains (each with 40-50 cars) under the slogan of intensifying support for the front lines, strengthening transportation. As a result, conductors felt they were insufficient and voluntarily did not rest, running three or four trips in a row, competing with each other. After the trade union's vigorous persuasion, the conductors accepted everyone's opinions. The families of railway workers have also fully engaged in production. Many family members of railway workers voluntarily helped clean up derailments, with everyone striving to be a labor hero.

　　东北工代劳模大会闭幕
  　平津铁路局等四代表团归来
    【本报讯】参加东北工代劳模大会的平津铁路管理局等四代表团一行一○八人，于四月二十六日离津、二十九日抵达哈尔滨，受到广大工人弟兄热烈无比的欢迎。该团在“五一”参加二十万职工大游行及连续十天的大会中，学习了东北职工运动三年半以来的经验收获很大。大会在十日闭幕后，又参观了有名的哈尔滨铁路工厂。十一日该团离哈，十六日抵津，本市代表则于昨（十七）日返平。据该团团员谈称：东北工人劳动热情之高，实属罕见，不仅修竣国民党破坏了的全部铁路桥梁、路基，并且在加紧支援前线的口号下，完成三百列车（每列挂四五十辆车皮），加强运输，因此乘务员感觉不敷用，即自动不休息，连续跑三趟四趟，互相竞赛，经过职工会大力说服，各乘务员接受了大家意见。铁路员工家属亦全部投入生产，许多铁路工人的家眷自动帮助清理倒岔子，人人争取做劳动英雄。
