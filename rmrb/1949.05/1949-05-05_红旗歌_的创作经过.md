The Creation Process of "Red Flag Song"
    Chen Miao

    As soon as Shijiazhuang was liberated, we were sent down to the factory, as practical workers, to participate in the work of the factory's trade union, administration, and the Party and Youth League. Over the past year, we have taught workers, taught songs, and guided them to learn to read; we have gone to the workshops, sweating profusely to learn "threading and knotting," to learn production techniques, and to help workers solve unity problems. In these most practical and concrete tasks, we were able to talk and laugh with many worker comrades, making the workers feel intimately that we were approachable and there to serve them, and that they could consult us about anything without hesitation, establishing a close relationship. Precisely because of this, we witnessed and personally experienced the rapid increase in the class consciousness of worker comrades and their unprecedented surge in labor enthusiasm. Especially after the start of the "Red Flag Competition," workers, in order to win the glorious red flag, disregarded all difficulties, even risking bombing, to persist in production. The struggle between the backward and the advanced workers, and between democratic management and bureaucratic management, constituted the rich content of the great transformation from old to new in the factory. These historically unprecedented changes moved us and educated us, and as literary and art workers, even if our political and artistic cultivation was still very poor, we should "unshirkably" boldly create for these new figures.

    During the incubation stage of "Red Flag Song," nearly a hundred Party and Youth League members and activists among the workers talked to us individually or collectively about how they united and transformed "backward" elements in the competition, how they won the red flag, how they jumped and shouted for the red flag, and how they cried and shouted for the red flag. They enriched our experience.

    In terms of leadership, Comrade Dai Xinmin, the Party leader in the yarn factory, Comrade Xia Ne, the director of the engineering department, Comrade Wang Zhengxin, the administrator, as well as many other staff members, branch directors, and even team leaders, enthusiastically talked to us about many leadership issues, giving us a clearer understanding of the factory's management policies, ideology, and actual situation. This, in the creation of "Red Flag Song," was like what the worker comrades gave us, a pillar, a source; this is a close cooperation between literary and art work and practical work.

    During the initial creation of "Red Flag Song," Lu Mei, Xin Daming, and Chen Miao collectively discussed and each wrote different acts. Comrade Zhou Yang read the rough draft at that time and gave us valuable instructions, providing us with great inspiration and encouragement in ideology. This force became one of the important factors that enabled us to continue to revise it constantly and intensively.

    When the school leadership decided that the temporary art troupe (Third Troupe) should stage the play, Comrades Liu Canglang, Chen Huai'ai, and Liu Muduo from the directing team, and Comrade Zhang Defa, the head of the art section, participated and offered many concrete suggestions. Comrade Lu Mei made another revision, strengthening the drama of "Red Flag Song" from its initial, relatively rough draft. It was produced in Shijiazhuang after only twenty days of work, revising while rehearsing, working day and night.

    After more than a dozen performances in Shijiazhuang and Zhengding, the opinions of worker comrades and leading cadres were solicited in the yarn factory. Especially in Zhengding, at a symposium attended by all comrades of the Third Troupe and several comrades from the literary group, many comrades spoke enthusiastically. At this meeting, the shortcomings of "Red Flag Song" were discussed more thoroughly, and everyone responsibly researched and laid the foundation for this revision.

    After accepting the school's task of performing in Beijing on May Day, it was decided that in addition to the original three authors, Comrades Liu Canglang, Chen Huai'ai, and Liu Muduo from the directing team would also participate in the creation. This added a powerful new force to the creation of "Red Flag Song" and opened a new page in its creation.

    Based on the opinions of all parties, in addition to maintaining the advantages of the first "Red Flag Song," the characters and structure were re-discussed. In terms of characters, Xiao Meigu, a child-like worker with poor ideological awareness, was replaced by Ma Fenjie, an older worker with a serious employee perspective. In terms of character transformation, it was not based on the factory trade union's relief after the bombing, but mainly on the spirit of enthusiastic unity, mutual assistance, and democratic management enlightenment and education among the workers, which awakened her from her serious employee perspective. In terms of management, the contrast between democratic management and bureaucratic management was made more distinct, and the ideological struggle in management was more closely linked to the ideological struggle among the workers.

    After the six people jointly drafted the outline, Lu Mei, Xin Daming, and Chen Miao each wrote different acts, and finally Comrade Lu Mei was responsible for unified revision. Because the task was urgent, it was still revised while rehearsing, and it took only twenty days to rush out the current "Red Flag Song."

    From the entire creation process of "Red Flag Song," it can be seen that this is a fairly broad collective creation. There is the care and support of the leadership; the enthusiastic help of the staff comrades, and the close cooperation within the literary and art workers, from directors, actors, stage workers, and playwrights. Without such a magnificent collective force, not only would there be no "Red Flag Song" today, but even such a repeated revision spirit would be difficult for us, who are new to literature and art, to sustain. This once again proves that exerting the power of the collective is great.

    But this does not mean that "Red Flag Song" is already "great." Although it has been revised several times in a row, each time it was done in a rush state with no time to catch our breath, and our political and artistic cultivation is very poor. The reason why we dare to boldly present "Red Flag Song" this time is precisely to further give full play to the power of the collective, and prepare to revise and improve it by constantly listening to everyone's opinions, so that "Red Flag Song" can become a script that can serve the workers well. Therefore, we eagerly hope that those who lead factories and trade unions, literary and art workers, and all viewers of "Red Flag Song" will all participate and give us their opinions without any politeness, with a responsible spirit.

    Regarding the relationship between the individual and the collective in collective creation; individual style and collective style; whether it is better for each person to write a round in the division of labor, or for everyone to discuss and one person to write, or for everyone to jointly write different acts; and many other issues encountered in collective creation, we plan to conduct an in-depth review in the future and then study them together with everyone.

    “红旗歌”的创作经过
    陈淼
    石家庄一解放，我们便被派下厂，做为一个实际工作者，参加了纱厂的职工会行政，以及党的、团的工作。一年来，我们给工人教课，教歌，把着手教给他们认字；到车间里去，满头大汗的学习“上线、接头”，学习生产技术，帮助工人解决团结问题。在这些最实际、最具体的工作中，我们能和许多工人同志有说有笑，使工人亲切的感到我们没有架子，是为他们服务的，什么事都不避讳地找我们商量，建立了亲密的关系。正因为如此，我们才亲眼看见了、亲身体验了工人同志阶级觉悟飞速的提高，劳动热情空前的高涨。特别是开始“红旗竞赛”以后，工人们为了争得光荣的红旗，不顾一切困难，甚至冒着轰炸的危险，也要坚持生产。这里面落后于进步工人之间，民主管理与官僚主义的管理之间的斗争，构成了工厂里由旧到新的伟大变革的丰富内容。这些历史上空前的变化感动了我们，教育了我们，做为一个文艺工作者，那怕是政治上、艺术上的修养都还很差，也“义不容辞”的应该大胆的为这些新生的人物而创作。
    “红旗歌”在酝酿阶段，有近百个工人中的党团员、积极分子，个别的或集体的给我们谈，在竞赛中他们怎样团结改造了“落后”分子，怎样争得红旗，如何为红旗而欢跳，又如何为红旗而哭叫。他们丰富了我们的体验。
    在领导上，纱厂里党的负责人戴新民同志，工务部长夏讷同志，管理员王正心同志，以及其他许多职员，分会主任，甚至组长也都热心的给我们谈了许多领导上的问题，使我们对工厂管理的政策思想、实际情况有了更明确的认识，这在“红旗歌”的创作中，也和工人同志所给我们的一样，是一个支柱、一个源泉；这是文艺工作与实际工作的一个密切的合作。
    “红旗歌”在第一次创作时，是由鲁煤、辛大明、陈淼三人集体讨论，分幕执笔。周扬同志看了当时粗具规模的草稿，给我们宝贵的指示，在思想上给我们很大的启示和鼓舞。这个力量成为我们能继续不断地突击修改的重要因素之一。
    当学校的领导上决定由临时文工团（三团）排演时，由导演团的刘沧浪、陈怀皑、刘木铎，艺术股长张德发等同志，参加了许多具体意见，由鲁煤同志又做了一次修改，使“红旗歌”由最初比较粗糙的初稿加强了它的戏剧性。前后只有二十天的功夫，边排边改，日夜突击的情况下搞出来的，便是在石家庄演出的“红旗歌”。
    经过石家庄、正定十几场的演出后，在纱厂里征求了工人同志和领导干部的意见，特别是在正定由三团全体同志及文学组的几位同志参加的座谈会上，许多同志都热烈的发了言。在这个会上更彻底的讨论了“红旗歌”的缺点，大家负责的研讨，打下了这次修改的基础。
    接受了学校“五一”在北平演出的任务后，便确定除原来三个作者之外，又由导演团刘沧浪、陈怀皑、刘木铎三同志参加创作，这给“红旗歌”的创作，增加了一支有力的生力军，揭开了“红旗歌”创作的新页。
    我们根据各方的意见，除保持第一次“红旗歌”的优点之外，人物、结构又重新讨论过。在人物上把肖美姑这样小孩式的、思想性较差的工人，换为一个年纪较大严重的雇佣观点的马芬姐；在人物转变上不是用被炸后厂里职工会的救济，而是主要靠工友们的热诚的团结互助和民主管理的启发教育的精神，使她由严重的雇佣观点中觉醒起来。在管理上把民主管理与官僚主义的管理的对比更加鲜明，而且把管理上的思想斗争与工人中的思想斗争更加紧密的连系起来。
    六个人一齐拟好提纲后，由鲁煤、辛大明、陈淼三人分幕执笔，最后由鲁煤同志负责统一修改，因为任务紧迫，仍是边排边改，又是仅仅二十天的功夫，突击出目前的“红旗歌”。
    从“红旗歌”整个创作经过中可以看出，这是一个相当广泛的集体创作。这里有领导上的关心和扶植；有职工同志的热心帮助，也有文艺工作者内部、从导演、演员、舞台工作者与剧作者的密切合作。没有这样雄大的集体力量，不仅没有今天“红旗歌”，单就这样反复的修改精神，在我们初学文艺的人，都是难以支持的，这里再一次的证明了发挥集体的力量是伟大的。
    但这决不等于说“红旗歌”已经“伟大”了。虽然一连修改了几次，但每次都是在连喘息时间都没有的突击状态中搞出来的，而且我们在政治上、艺术上的修养都很差，这次敢于这样大胆的拿出“红旗歌”，正是为了更进一步的充分发挥集体的力量，准备在不断地听取大家的意见中修改、提高，把“红旗歌”搞成能很好的为工人服务的剧本。因此，我们热望于领导工厂、职工会的实际工作者，文艺工作者、所有看“红旗歌”的观众人人有份，以大家负责的精神毫不客气，给我们提出意见来。
    关于集体创作中，个人与集体的关系；个人风格与集体风格；在分工上是每人轮写一遍好，是大家讨论一人执笔好，还是共同分幕写好；以及其他许多在集体创作中碰到的问题，我们准备将来深入的检讨后，再与大家一块研究。
