    To Slaughter the Chinese People
    American Imperialists Send Two More Warships to the Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd] According to a Reuter dispatch from Pearl Harbor on the 26th of last month: The two escort destroyers, "Taizhou" and "Taihu" (both transliterations), that the American imperialists gave to the remnant Kuomintang bandit gang, loaded with ammunition from the U.S. Navy armory in Pearl Harbor, sailed from the port on April 26th. It was also said that the two ships were originally scheduled to go to Shanghai, but fearing that they would fall into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, they might go to Yokohama, Japan, first. These two warships are the last two of the four warships that the American imperialists gave to the Kuomintang bandit gang in Norfolk, Virginia, for the purpose of slaughtering the Chinese people. The other two warships, "Taihe" and "Taicang," arrived at the Zuoying naval port in Taiwan on the 22nd of last month.

    用来屠杀中国人民
    美帝又送匪帮军舰两艘
    【新华社北平二日电】据美联社珍珠港上月二十六日电披露：美帝国主义者送给残余国民党匪帮的两只护航驱逐舰泰州号和太湖号（均译音），从珍珠港美国海军军火库里装载满船军火于四月二十六日驶离该港。又称，两舰原定开到上海，但是害怕会落到解放军手里，可能先开到日本横滨。按这两艘军舰是美帝国主义者在弗吉尼亚洲诺福克送给国民党匪帮作为屠杀中国人民之用的四艘军舰中的最后两只。另外两只军舰太和号和太仓号，已于上月二十二日开到台湾左营军港。
