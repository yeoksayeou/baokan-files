　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, May 28th: The People's Voice newspaper here published an article stating: The fact that the US and Britain have agreed to hold a foreign ministers' meeting does not mean that these countries have abandoned their policy of creating faits accomplis and disrupting international relations. On the same day that the foreign ministers' meeting opened, the so-called "Bonn Constitution," which attempts to permanently split Germany, was announced. This West German "constitution" is a blatant violation of the Potsdam Agreement, which serves as the basis for the foreign ministers' meeting. Therefore, the US and Britain are playing a double game. Because of the "Bonn Constitution," German imperialist groups can smoothly implement their revenge policies. This is why the announcement of the "constitution" in the US and British occupation zones must be regarded as a conspiracy, the purpose of which is to oppose the Paris Conference, which had aroused great hope throughout the world. It has become clear in recent months that the people of all countries desire peace. Those who are trying to undermine the Paris Conference are opposing the vital interests and fundamental aspirations of the masses of the people. The Soviet Union's unwavering policy of safeguarding peace gives us reason to believe that the warmongers' conspiracy will once again be crushed.

　　一面参加会议一面分裂德国
  　波报评斥美英玩弄两面戏法
    【新华社北平二十八日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：此间人民言论报顷著论称：美英同意举行外长会议，并不意味着这些国家已经放弃制造既成事实及扰乱国际关系的政策。在外长会议开会的同日，企图永远分裂德国的所谓“波恩宪法”宣布了。这一西德“宪法”是彰明昭著地违反作为外长会议活动之基础的波茨坦协议的。因此，美英正在玩弄两面戏法。由于“波恩宪法”，德国帝国主义集团就可以顺利地实施复仇政策。这就是何以美英联占区“宪法”的宣布必须被认为是一种阴谋，其目的，在于反对曾在全世界引起巨大希望的巴黎会议。近数月来已清楚表明：一切国家的人民希望和平。那些正在力求破坏巴黎会议的人，是在反对人民大众生存攸关的利益和基本愿望。苏联不屈不挠地维护和平的政策，使我们有理由相信，战争贩子的阴谋将再次被粉碎。
