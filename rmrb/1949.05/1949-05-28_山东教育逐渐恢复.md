Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th—Education in Shandong is gradually recovering. In the second half of 1947, Shandong suffered severe enemy and natural disasters, which brought the province's education work to a near standstill. After the situation in Shandong improved last year, the government began efforts to restore it in September. The current state of education in the province is as follows:

　　Specialized Education: Provincial departments have established 17 specialized schools of a technical nature, with over 10,000 students. By March of this year, more than 6,000 students had participated in various construction projects. These schools are continuing to expand, especially those focusing on industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, commerce, and transportation.

　　Secondary Education: The province currently has 49 public secondary schools and 18 registered private secondary schools, totaling 67 schools (there are still over a dozen unregistered ones not included). There are over 2,200 faculty and staff members and over 31,000 students. To provide opportunities for the children of the working people to attend school, the province provides scholarships for over 6,000 normal school students. In addition to that, other secondary schools provide 1,825 scholarships and 1,762 subsidies.

　　Primary Education: According to incomplete statistics, the province currently has over 20,000 public and private primary schools (excluding unregistered private primary schools), over 36,000 faculty and staff members, and over 1,260,000 students. In Jinan City, as of April, there were 115 public and private primary schools with 42,936 students.

　　Mass Education: In the cities, since the "Launch Urban Workers' Education" directive was issued in February, many worker night schools and supplementary schools have been established. According to statistics from Jinan, Weifang, and Jining alone, there are 62 worker and shop employee night schools with 4,780 students (excluding municipal worker schools and worker night schools within state-owned factories). In rural areas, efforts are being made to restore mass education work for youth and women. According to statistics from eight counties in the Lunan Central Region, which suffered extremely severe enemy and natural disasters, there were 10,880 literacy classes for youth, children, and women, and 150 rural theater troupes this spring.

　　山东教育逐渐恢复
    【新华社济南二十五日电】山东教育在逐渐恢复中。一九四七年下半年，山东遭受严重的敌灾、天灾，使得全省教育工作几乎全部停顿。去年山东局势好转后，政府就在九月着手努力恢复。现在全省教育概况如下：
    专门教育：省级各业务部门举办的专科性质的学校十七所，学员万余名，迄本年三月间已有六千多名参加各项建设工作。现在各校正在继续扩大，工矿、农林、商业、交通等校尤其发达。
    中等教育：全省现有公立中等学校四十九所，已备案私立中学十八所，共六十七所（未备案的还有十几所没算在内），教职员二千二百多人，学生三万一千多人。为照顾劳动人民的子弟入学，全省除师范生六千多名外，各中学中并设公费生一千八百二十五名，补助生一千七百六十二名。
    小学教育：据不完全统计，全省现有公私立小学二万多所（未备案的私立小学不在内），教职员三万六千多人，小学生一百二十六万多人。济南市四月间已有公私立小学一百一十五所，学生四万二千九百三十六人。
    群众教育：在城市中，自二月份发出了“开展城市职工教育”指示后，各城市开办的职工夜校、补习学校等很多，仅据济南、潍坊、济宁三市的统计，就有职工、店员夜校六十二所，学员四千七百八十人（市立的职工学校和各公营工厂内的工人夜校没算在内）。在农村中，正尽力恢复青年、妇女等群众教育工作。据遭受敌灾、天灾极严重的鲁中南六专署地区八个县的统计，今春就有青年、儿童、妇女识字班一万零八百八十个，农村剧团一百五十个。
