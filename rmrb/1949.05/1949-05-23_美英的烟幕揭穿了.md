Behind the Scenes

　　The US and British imperialists have gone to great lengths in Greece, at the southern tip of the Balkans. After World War II, British imperialism carried out the massacres created by Scobie, and used "dead souls elections" to push royalist fascist bandits onto the throne in Athens. After British imperialism shouted itself hoarse, it still failed to achieve its sinister goals, so the "Truman Doctrine" replaced it. American officers directly participated in the war, and American planes and cannons rolled in, but things still "went against their wishes." The Greek people used their firm struggle and a series of victories to crush the Athens puppet regime and all the offensives of the US and Britain, and gradually gained the initiative. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Greek Communist Party declared that it would strive to make this year the year of decisive victory! The fate of the Athens puppet regime is about to collapse, and the dream of the US and Britain to establish a base for anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries in Greece is about to be shattered. Therefore, they vainly attempt to spread some rumors that distort the facts to confuse the public. Now, after the TASS statement and another communiqué from the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, the eyes of the people of the world are even brighter. On the one hand, they understand the sinister schemes behind the US and British smoke screen, and on the other hand, they also recognize the key to "getting the Greek situation back on track"!

　　美英的烟幕揭穿了
    美英两个帝国主义在巴尔干南端的希腊，是煞费了苦心的。二次世界大战结束后，英帝斯科比所制造的大屠杀，又用“死魂灵选举”将保皇法西斯匪徒推上雅典王座，英帝声嘶力竭之后仍然是达不到阴谋目的，乃由“杜鲁门主义”代替了它；美帝的军官直接参战，美帝的飞机大炮滚滚而至，依然“事与愿违”，希腊人民用坚强的斗争和一系列的胜利粉碎了雅典小朝廷和美英的一切攻势而且逐渐地掌握了主动权，希共五中全会，声明争取今年为决定胜利年！雅典小朝廷的命运眼看就要崩溃，美英在希建立反苏反人民民主国家基地的梦想就要破灭。于是妄想散布一些歪曲事实的谣言，来淆惑视听，现经塔斯社的声明和希腊临时民主政府又一次的公报，全世界的人民眼睛更为雪亮，一方面明白了在美英烟幕后面的阴谋诡计，另一方面也认清了“使希腊情势走入正轨”的关键！
