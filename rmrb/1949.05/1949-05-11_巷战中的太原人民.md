    The People of Taiyuan in Street Fighting
    Ning Gan
    On the morning of April 24th, the People's Liberation Army entered the city of Taiyuan. After the reporter entered the city with the second echelon, he saw a wounded Yan Army soldier at the foot of the city wall. He said: "I used to be a street vendor in the city. Last winter, I was forcibly drafted into the Yan Army. I didn't want to do it at all, but I didn't dare to run away in the city in the past. ... When the battle started, the brothers didn't want to fight. The supervising team forced us to fight. This leg was shot by them..." He said: "I was just hoping you would come in sooner, so I would suffer one day less..."
    When the troops reached the south entrance of Green Willow Lane, a burst of applause suddenly came from the courtyard on the right. I ran in out of curiosity and saw more than thirty workers in tattered clothes surrounding five People's Liberation Army soldiers. "Folks, don't be afraid!" This was what Ba Lanzeng, the third platoon leader of the PLA's vanguard company, was saying: "We are the people's army led by the working class, here to liberate you..."
    "Good! Good! We've been waiting for you for more than half a year. Finally, you're here..." Another burst of applause mixed with cheers. In the midst of the fierce battle, this sound was so moving! This is the cheers and applause from the hearts of thousands of workers in the city.
    The street fighting was raging like fire. The People's Liberation Army asked the workers to take shelter in the houses to avoid the bullets, and they were going to fight towards Hanxi Street, but there were no guides. At this time, an old worker volunteered and jumped up and said, "Comrades, follow me!"
    When he walked out of the courtyard, he saw some soldiers covered in mud, barefoot and their feet cut by rubble. The old man was moved to tears. He took off his own shoes and grabbed Lan Jishun, a soldier from the sixth squad, and ordered: "Comrade, put on these shoes."
    On the street, wherever we occupied, the doors opened, and the people appeared on the street. When the follow-up troops came up, tables, teapots, and bowls were set up in many places on the street, as if they had been prepared long ago. A female worker in her thirties, panting, carried a bucket of boiling water and placed it on the street. Her bloodshot eyes shone with extraordinary excitement. She shouted: "Comrades, drink water. This bucket is freshly boiled, this bucket is cold, drink whichever you want!"
    The battle was over, and the city of Taiyuan was bustling with activity. A rickshaw puller, pulling an empty rickshaw, walked and shouted: "I've been waiting for this day. I won't have to worry about food, clothing, and work anymore!"
    The reporter went to the home of worker Liu Zhenhe to rest for a while. He was lying sick in bed wearing a dirty single shirt. He worked in a locomotive factory, and he only got one jin of rotten rice for a day's work. His family of four depended on him for everything, and one jin of rice was not enough to make rice soup! There was no choice but to work overtime, but how could he hold on if he wasn't full? He was so tired that he vomited blood! He had to grit his teeth and keep working, otherwise his whole family would starve to death. Since the fighting, he had not been able to go to work outside the city. His whole family had not eaten for two days. He said sadly: "Many people have starved to death in Taiyuan! If you hadn't come a few days later, my whole family would have starved to death."
    At this time, his wife—a woman in her thirties—suddenly ran into the courtyard. As soon as she entered the courtyard, she shouted: "Dad, the kids are all right, we won't starve to death!" She ran out of the city as soon as we entered the city to get some grain in advance from the factory. The factory had already been taken over by the People's Liberation Army, and the factory immediately gave her ten jin of white flour and told her to tell her husband to take good care of himself and that the factory would definitely find a way to help solve any difficulties. Zhou Zhenhe held my hand, looked at his wife with a smile, and couldn't say a word, moved to tears. These are the tears of thousands of workers! His wife blamed him for taking off his cotton-padded jacket and not covering himself with a quilt when he was sick. He smiled and said: "It's strange, maybe it's because I'm sick. It's already the end of March, and the willows have sprouted, but ever since one morning in late autumn until now, I've always been terribly cold. I always said that winter hadn't passed, so there was no sign of spring. But now? I'm not cold at all, and it really feels like spring weather!"
    Yes, spring came long ago, and it's about to pass, but it didn't arrive in Taiyuan until today. However, even faster than the arrival of spring, the Zhengtai Railway train carrying grain arrived in Taiyuan City at twelve o'clock, two hours after the end of the battle at ten o'clock.

    巷战中的太原人民
    宁干
    四月二十四日早晨，解放军打进了太原城。记者随二梯队进城后，见城墙下有一个腿部负伤的阎军，他说：“我原是城内摆小摊的，去冬被阎军强编入军队，自己根本不愿干，但过去在城内不敢跑。……战斗开始，弟兄们就不想打了，督战队逼着叫打，我这腿就是叫他们打的……”他说：“我光盼你们早打进来，我这罪就少受一天……”
    部队进至绿柳巷南口时，忽然从右侧院中传出一阵掌声，我好奇的跑进去，见三十多个身穿着破旧衣服的工人，正围着五个人民解放军战士。“乡亲们，别怕了！”这是解放军尖刀连三排长巴兰增在讲话：“我们是工人阶级领导的人民军队解放你们来了……”
    “好！好！盼了你们半年多啦，好容易盼进来了……”又是一阵掌声夹杂着欢呼声，在激烈的战斗中这声音多么动人呀！这是千万个工内人心的欢呼和掌声。
    巷战正在火样的进行，解放军叫工人到房内暂避枪弹，要打旱西街去，但没向导，这时一个老工人自告奋勇的跳起来说：“同志们跟我走！”
    当他走出院门碰见有的战士混身是泥，赤着足被瓦砾割得满足血，老汉感动得流了泪，脱下自己的鞋子抓住六班战士蓝纪顺命令似的说：“同志，你穿上这双鞋。”
    在街上，我们占领了那里，那里的门都开了，街上便出现了人民。当后续部队上来时，街上不少地方摆上桌子茶壶、碗，好象他们早有准备。一个三十来岁的女工气喘喘的挑一桶开水放在街上，带血丝的眼睛放着异常兴奋的光彩。嚷道：“同志们喝水，这桶才开的，这桶是冷的，愿意喝那个喝那个！”
    战斗结束了，太原城活跃起来了。一个洋车夫拉着空车边走边嚷：“可盼到了这一天，以后吃的穿的工作都不发愁啦！”
    记者到工人刘振和家中暂时歇歇，他穿着污旧的单褂卧病在床上，他在机车厂作工，作一天工发一斤烂大米，家中大小四口人全靠他养活，一斤大米喝米汤也不够呀！没办法只得加夜班，但是吃不饱那能顶住呀！累得吐血！吐血也得咬牙干，不然全家就得饿死。打仗以来不能出城上工，全家两天没吃饭了，他悲痛的说：“太原饿死的人可不少了！你们再迟几天不来，我全家都得饿死。”
    这时他妻子——一个三十多岁的女人忽然跑进院来，进院子就喊：“娃他爸，可好了，饿不死了！”她是当我们打进城后就跑出城，到工厂内去预支点粮食，工厂以前已为解放军接管，厂内立即支给她十斤白面并嘱咐她告诉丈夫好好养病，有什么困难厂内一定设法帮助解决。周振和握着我的手，笑看着妻子一句话也说不出来，感动的流着热泪。这是千万个工人的眼泪呵！妻怨他有病不该脱去棉袄也不盖被子。他笑了笑说：“说也奇怪，也许是我有病的过，已是三月底的天气了，柳树都发芽了，可是从去秋有一天早晨起到现在我老是冷的不行，我总说冬天没有过去，就没有个春天的样子。但是现在呢？身上一点也不冷，觉得真象春天天气了！”
    是的，春天早就来了，而且即将过去，但却直到今天才降临太原。然而比春天来的更快的是正太路火车十点钟结束战斗十二点钟就载着粮食开到了太原市。
