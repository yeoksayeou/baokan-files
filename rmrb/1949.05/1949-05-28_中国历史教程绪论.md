　　Introduction to Chinese History Tutorial
    Wu Yuzhang
    II. Methods of Studying Chinese History (Continued from III)
    We believe that only by using Marx's dialectical materialism and historical materialism to study Chinese history can we have the only correct position and method.
    "What is dialectical materialism?
    What is historical materialism?
    Dialectical materialism is the world view of the Marxist-Leninist party. It is called dialectical materialism because its view of natural phenomena, its method of studying natural phenomena, and its method of understanding these phenomena are dialectical, and its explanation of natural phenomena, its understanding of natural phenomena, and its theory are materialistic.
    Historical materialism is the extension of the principles of dialectical materialism to the study of social life, the application of the principles of dialectical materialism to the phenomena of social life, to the study of society, and to the study of social history." ("History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," p. 133, Moscow, 1948 edition)
    "Dialectic is derived from the Greek word 'dialogo,' which means to talk and argue. What the ancients called dialectic was the art of seeking truth by exposing contradictions in the opponent's arguments and overcoming these contradictions." (Ibid., p. 134)
    "Dialectic is fundamentally opposed to metaphysics." (Ibid., p. 134)
    I. Dialectic believes that:
    "Since there are no isolated phenomena in the world, and since all phenomena are interconnected and mutually restrictive, then in assessing every historical social system and every social movement, one should not, of course, start from 'eternal justice' or some other prejudice, as historians often do, but should start from the conditions from which this system and this social movement arose and with which they are connected." (Ibid., p. 139)
    Therefore, Mencius's theory of destiny that "a king will rise every five hundred years," the historical cyclical theory of "the world has been long in existence, one order and one chaos," and the so-called "eternal justice" of "legitimate and partial," "great righteousness," and other forever unchanging concepts of good and evil, and absolutely unconditional ethical concepts, are all unscientific.
    "Slavery, in the light of modern conditions, is a very absurd phenomenon, an abnormal and absurd thing. However, slavery under the conditions of the disintegration of the primitive commune system is a completely understandable and regular phenomenon, because it is a step forward compared to the primitive commune system.
    The demand for a bourgeois democratic republic, under the conditions of the Tsarist system and the existence of bourgeois society, for example, in Russia in 1905, is a completely understandable, correct, and revolutionary demand, because a bourgeois republic was a step forward at that time. However, the demand for a bourgeois democratic republic, in the light of our current conditions in the Soviet Union, is an absurd and counter-revolutionary demand, because a bourgeois republic is a step backward compared to the Soviet republic." (Ibid., p. 139)
    In China under semi-feudal and semi-colonial conditions, in the past--before the "May Fourth" Movement, the demands for an independent, free, and equal democratic republic were completely understandable, correct, and revolutionary. However, now--now that capitalist republics in the world are outdated and corrupt, and there are the latest socialist republics, what China wants is not to realize an old-fashioned capitalist democratic republic, but to realize a new democratic republic.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said:
    "The Republic of China to be established now can only be a democratic republic of the joint dictatorship of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people. This is the new democratic republic, that is, the new Three People's Principles republic of the truly revolutionary Three Great Policies. This new democratic republic is different from the old-fashioned, European and American-style, bourgeois dictatorial, capitalist republic on the one hand. This is the old democratic republic, which is outdated. On the other hand, it is also different from the latest, Soviet-style, proletarian dictatorial, socialist republic. This is the newest democratic republic, which has flourished in the Soviet Union and will be established in all capitalist countries, and will undoubtedly become the ruling form of state composition and power composition in all advanced countries. However, this kind of republic is not yet applicable to colonial and semi-colonial countries in a certain historical period. Therefore, in all revolutionary colonial and semi-colonial countries, the only form of state in a certain historical period can only be the third form, which is the so-called new democratic republic. This is a form of a certain historical period, and therefore a transitional form, but a necessary form that cannot be changed." (Mao Zedong: "On New Democracy")
    "Everything depends on conditions, place, and time.
    Obviously, without this historical view of observing social phenomena, historical science would be unable to exist and develop, because only such a view can prevent historical science from becoming a muddled account of accidental phenomena and a pile of absurd errors." ("History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," p. 139)
    II. Dialectic believes that:
    "Since the world is in constant motion and constant development, and since the law of development is the decay of the old and the growth of the new, then there is naturally no 'eternally unchanging' social order, no 'eternal principles' of private ownership and exploitation, and no 'eternal concepts' of peasants obeying landlords and workers obeying capitalists." (Ibid., pp. 139-140)
    That is to say:
    "The capitalist system can be replaced by the socialist system, just as the capitalist system replaced the feudal system at that time." (Ibid., p. 140)
    III. Dialectic believes that:
    "The most important thing is not what seems solid at present but has already begun to decay, but what is being produced and is developing, even if it does not seem solid at present, because in the eyes of dialectic, only what is being produced and is developing is invincible." (Ibid., p. 135)
    That is to say:
    "It is not to rely on the classes in society that are no longer developing, even if these classes still have a dominant force at present, but to rely on the classes in society that are developing and have broad prospects, even if these classes are not yet a dominant force at present.
    In the 1880s, when Marxists fought against the Populists, the Russian proletariat was still a small minority compared to the individual peasants who accounted for the vast majority of the population at that time. However, the proletariat was a developing class at that time, while the peasantry was a class that was disintegrating. Precisely because the proletariat was a developing class, the Marxists relied on the proletariat. And they were not mistaken, because everyone knows that the proletariat has later developed from a small force into a first-rate historical and political force." (Ibid., p. 140)
    The fact that the Chinese proletariat has grown from a small force to a huge historical and political force in the revolution in the past three or forty years is a fact recognized by everyone. Some historians have only seen one aspect of outdated, corrupt, and decaying social phenomena, and then think that "the world is declining," "people's hearts are not as good as before," "things are going from bad to worse," and "the end of the world" is inevitable. Therefore, they "criticize the present and praise the past" and advocate retrogressive fallacies such as restoring the classics, which is an extremely confused idea that violates the laws of social development.
    That is to say:
    "In order not to make mistakes in politics, one must look forward, not backward." (Ibid.)
    IV. Dialectic believes that:
    "Since the law of development is the transition from slow quantitative change to rapid and sudden qualitative change, then the revolutionary change implemented by the oppressed classes is naturally a completely natural and inevitable phenomenon." (Ibid.)
    That is to say: the transformation from feudal or semi-feudal society to a more progressive society and the liberation of oppressed nations from imperialist oppression, like the transformation from capitalism to socialism and the liberation of the working class from capitalist oppression, can never be accomplished through slow changes, nor through the path of reform, but only through the qualitative change of the feudalist system or the capitalist system, through the revolutionary path.
    The reason why the revolutionary movement in China in the past fifty years has failed to pull China out of the status of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, in addition to other major reasons, the most important is that it has been harmed by the reformist compromise faction, which has made the revolution incomplete, and made Chinese society unable to undergo qualitative changes and achieve liberation and progress.
    That is to say:
    "In order not to make mistakes in politics, one must be a revolutionary, not a reformist." (Ibid.)

　　中国历史教程绪论
    吴玉章
    二、研究中国历史的方法（续三）
    我们认为：只有用马克思的辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义来研究中国历史才是唯一正确的立场与方法。
    “什么是辩证唯物主义呢？
    什么是历史唯物主义呢？
    辩证唯物主义是马列主义党底世界观。其所以叫作辩证唯物主义，是因为它对自然界现象的看法，它研究自然界现象的方法，它认识这些现象的方法，是辩证的，而它对自然界现象的解释，它对自然界现象的了解，它的理论，是唯物主义的。
    历史唯物主义就是把辩证唯物主义原理推广去研究社会生活，把辩证唯物主义原理应用于社会生活现象，应用于研究社会，应用于研究社会历史。”（“联共党史”，一三三页莫斯科一九四八年版）
    “辩证法是导源于希腊文ｄｉａｌｅｇｏ一字，其含义就是进行谈话，进行论战。古代人所谓辩证法，就是以揭露对方议论中的矛盾并克服这些矛盾来求得真理的方术。”（同上，一三四页）
    “辩证法是与形而上学根本相反的。”（同上，一三四页）
    Ⅰ　辩证法认为：
    “既然世界上没有孤立的现象，既然所有一切现象都是彼此关联，互相制约，那末在估计历史上每一个社会制度和每一个社会运动时，当然也就不可如历史家常作的那样从‘永恒正义’或其他某种成见出发，而是要从这个制度和这个社会运动所由产生并与其相联结的那些条件出发。”（同上，一三九页）
    因此，孟子所谓：“五百年必有王者兴”的天命论，“天下之生久矣，一治一乱。”的历史循环论，以及所谓：“正统偏安”，“大义名分”等等永远不变的善恶的概念，绝对无条件的伦常观念的“永恒正义”的学说，都不合乎科学。
    “奴隶制度，就现代的条件来看，是很荒谬的现象，反常的荒诞事情。而奴隶制度在瓦解着的原始公社制度条件下，却是完全可以了解并且合于规律的现象，因为它和原始公社制度相比是前进一步。
    资产阶级民主共和国的要求，在沙皇制度和资产阶级社会存在的条件下，譬如说在一九○五年的俄国，是完全可以了解的一种正确的和革命的要求，因为资产阶级共和国在当时是前进一步。而资产阶级民主共和国的要求，就我们苏联现时的条件来看，却是一种荒谬的和反革命的要求，因为资产阶级共和国与苏维埃共和国相比是后退一步。”（同上，一三九页）
    在半封建半殖民地条件下的中国，在过去--在“五四”运动以前，独立、自由、平等的民主共和国的要求是完全可以了解的、正确的与革命的要求，但是，在现在--在世界上资本主义共和国已经过时了，腐化了，而又有了最新式的社会主义共和国的现在，在中国也就不是要实现旧式的资本主义的民主共和国，而是要实现新民主主义共和国。
    毛泽东同志说：
    “现在所要建立的中华民主共和国，只能是一切反帝反封建的人们联合专政的民主共和国，这就是新民主主义的共和国，也就是真正革命的三大政策的新三民主义共和国。这种新民主主义共和国，一方面与旧形式的、欧美式的、资产阶级专政的、资本主义的共和国相区别，这是旧民主主义的共和国，这种共和国已经过时了。另一方面，也与最新式的、苏联式的、无产阶级专政的、社会主义的共和国相区别，这是最新民主主义的共合国，这种共和国已经在苏联兴盛起来，并且还要在各资本主义国家建立起来，无疑将成为一切先进国家的国家构成与政权构成的统治形式。但是这种共和国，在一定的历史时期中，还不适用于殖民地半殖民地国家之中。因此，在一切革命的殖民地半殖民地国家，在一定历史时期中的国家形式，唯一的只能是第三种形式，这就是所谓新民主主义共和国。这是一定历史时期的形式，因而是过渡的形式，但是不可移易的必要的形式。”（毛泽东：“新民主主义论”）
    “一切都依条件，地方和时间为转移。
    显然，没有这种观察社会现象的历史观点，那历史科学就会无法存在和发展，因为只有这样的观点才能使历史科学不致变成一笔偶然现象的糊涂帐，不致变成一堆荒谬绝伦的错误。”（“联共党史”，一三九页）
    Ⅱ　辩证法认为：
    “既然世界是处在不断运动和不断发展中，既然旧东西衰亡和新东西生长是发展底规律，那末当然也就没有什么‘永世不移的’社会秩序，什么私有制和剥削制的‘永恒原则’，什么农民服从地主，工人服从资本家的‘永恒观念’。”（同上，一三九页到一四○页）
    这就是说：
    “资本主义制度可以用社会主义制度来替代，正如资本主义制度在当时替代了封建制度一样。”（同上，一四○页）
    Ⅲ　辩证法认为：
    “最重要的不是现时似乎坚固，但已经开始衰亡的东西，而是正在产生，正在发展的东西，那怕它现时似乎还不坚固，因为在辩证法看来，只有正在产生，正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。”（同上，一三五页）
    这就是说：
    “不是要指靠社会里已经不再发展的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还是占优势的力量，而是要指靠社会里正在发展，具有远大前途的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还不是占优势的力量。
    在第十九世纪八十年代，当马克思主义者和民粹派斗争的时候，俄国无产阶级与当时占居民绝大多数的个体农民比较起来，还是占很小的少数。但当时无产阶级是个发展着的阶级，而农民却是个日趋瓦解的阶级。正因为无产阶级是个发展着的阶级，所以马克思主义者也就指靠着无产阶级。而且他们并没有弄错，因为大家知道，无产阶级后来已由一个不大的力量发展成了历史上和政治上的头等力量。”（同上，一四○页）
    中国的无产阶级，近三四十年来，从很小的力量生长为革命中巨大的历史的与政治的力量，这是为人人所公认的事实，有些历史家只看见过时的、腐化的、正在衰亡的社会现象的一方面，而就以为“世道衰微”、“人心不古”、“江河日下”、“世界末日”等等所谓世界退化是必然的。因而“是古非今”大倡其复古读经等谬论，这是违反社会发展规律极糊涂的思想。
    这就是说：
    “为了在政治上不犯错误，便要向前看，而不要向后看。”（同上）
    Ⅳ　辩证法认为：
    “既然由缓慢的数变进到迅速的突然的质变是发展底规律，那末由被压迫阶级所实行的革命的变革，当然也就是完全自然而必不可免的现象。”（同上）
    这就是说：从封建或半封建社会到更进步社会的转变和被压迫民族从帝国主义压迫下的解放，也同从资本主义到社会主义的转变和工人阶级从资本主义的压迫下的解放一样，决不能经过缓慢的变化，决不能经过改良的道路来完成的，只能经过封建主义制度或资本主义制度之质的变化，经过革命的道路来完成。
    中国近五十年的革命运动之所以未能使中国脱出半封建半殖民地的地位，除了其他重大的原因外，最重要的就是受了改良妥协派的戕害，使革命不能彻底，使中国社会不能起质的变化而得到解放和进步。
    这就是说：
    “为了在政治上不犯错误，便要做革命家，而不要做改良主义者。”（同上）
    　　（未完）
