    Xianghe Second District
    Repairs Three Embankments
    [Jidong Telegraph] Under the leadership and organization of the special district, county, and district governments, farmers in over eighty villages in Xianghe Second District and Sanhe West District successfully completed the repair of three embankments from April 9th to 24th, a total of fifteen days. The total length of the sections repaired was 6,317 zhang, with 44,928 cubic meters of earth filled. Two hundred thousand mu of land have now been freed from flooding. In the past, the above-mentioned embankments could not be repaired due to obstruction by the Kuomintang bandit troops, resulting in the annual flooding of the Jiyun River. Since the liberation of all of North China, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has been high. After joint discussions by village cadres, it was decided to reasonably allocate labor based on the land area benefiting each village and assign it to each household. Families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers without labor were exempt from providing labor. The farmers provided their own food and did not incur expenses outside their villages. With the rational allocation of labor and cooperation, the farmers' enthusiasm for repairing the embankments was very high, and many women participated in the work.

    香河二区
    修好三条堤坝
    【冀东电】香河二区及三河西区八十余村庄农民在专、县、区各级政府的领导与组织下，自四月九日至二十四日的十五天内胜利完成了三条堤坝的修补工程，工段总长为六千三百一十七丈，搭土量为四万四千九百二十八方；二十万亩土地从此摆脱水患。按上述堤坝过去因受国民党匪军阻无法修补，致蓟运河连年泛滥。自华北全境解放后，农民生产情绪高涨，经各村干部共同研讨，决定按受益各村土地面积合理摊工，并布置到户，无劳力的烈军属不出工；民工伙食自备，不出村开支。在合理的摊工合作下，农民修堤情绪很高，并有很多妇女都参加了这一工作。
