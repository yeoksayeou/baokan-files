[Our Newspaper News]: Over the past four months, the workers' movement in Beiping has been steadily advancing and has achieved initial successes. From mobilizing workers to assist in the takeover to the resumption of work and the production competition to welcome "May Day," the workers of Beiping have gradually raised their class consciousness and political level, initially established a new labor attitude, and demonstrated production enthusiasm and creativity. They have shown their immense strength in completing the urgent tasks of supporting the front and construction. The 70th Arsenal completed the arduous task of repairing cannons, manufacturing guns, and producing a large quantity of ammunition in a short period. Since liberation, the Pingjin Clothing Factory has produced more than 300,000 sets of summer uniforms. The Changxindian Railway Factory completed 10,000 fishplates in a week, a task that previously took a month. The No. 40 Automobile Factory repaired more than 100 vehicles for the army heading south. The tram company's plan to have 100 trams running for "May Day" was completed ahead of schedule on April 20, and they are now working hard to build another 100 trams. In terms of various production records, some have exceeded the Japanese puppet period, and most have exceeded the pre-liberation period. For example, in Changxindian, Liu Baorong's team used to chop only 9 meters with nine workers, but now they chop up to 80.2 meters at most. In terms of saving raw materials and reducing waste, the stamping department of the 70th Arsenal used to produce 88 defective products per worker when manufacturing grenade reinforcement covers, but now it has been reduced to 31. In terms of inventions, the workers and engineers of Changxindian have cooperated to refine ferrosilicon, and the electrical workers of the tram company have created electrical insulation boards made of asbestos paper to replace imported products. The 70th Arsenal and other factories have also made many technical improvements and inventions.

There are approximately 60,000 industrial workers in state-owned enterprises in Beiping. According to existing statistics, there are 13,743 workers in private factories, and there are no complete figures for workers in various trades. Before the liberation of Beiping, the Workers' Committee of the CCP Municipal Committee held a half-month training class for worker cadres in Liangxiang. After the liberation of the suburbs, a large number of cadres were concentrated to form 39 working groups, which went to various districts, factories, and mines to work and created a lot of experience for entering the city. After the liberation of the whole city, the work of the working groups in 19 major enterprises and 20 districts was gradually unfolded in stages. The establishment of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions at the "February 7th" memorial meeting further strengthened the leadership of the city's workers' movement. With the goal of ensuring the takeover, restoration, transformation, and development of production, and with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests and both labor and capital, the work of the trade union was actively promoted.

In organizational work, the industrial trade unions in state-owned enterprises were first emphasized, followed by the trade unions in private factories, and then the trade unions in various trades. Among the state-owned enterprises, municipal enterprises such as electricity, telecommunications, trams, and tap water were first emphasized. In the first month after liberation, most of the 33 state-owned enterprises established preparatory committees for trade unions. By the end of April, all of them had established formal trade unions. According to existing statistics, of the more than 60,000 industrial workers in state-owned enterprises, 19,000 belong to the railway system, and more than 80% of them have joined trade unions. Of the remaining 41,180, 33,242 have been organized, also accounting for more than 80%. Some units even reached 100%. In the process of organization, the activities of yellow trade unions and Kuomintang puppet trade unions were first stopped, and their various crimes were announced to make the working masses aware of the true face of these reactionary organizations, so as to appreciate the importance of organizing their own trade unions today. At the same time, on the one hand, the reactionary arrogance of the old bureaucratic rulers in the factory was suppressed, and on the other hand, the tendency of some workers to discriminate against general staff and "not allow staff to join the trade union" was overcome, strengthening the unity of staff and workers. As of April 24, 4,127 workers in private factories and 11,797 workers in various trades had been organized in the city. The organizational work here is generally carried out in conjunction with the restoration of production, the mediation of labor-capital disputes, and the adjustment of wages.

In addition to the mass meetings mentioned above, study movements and cultural and recreational activities have been widely carried out in state-owned enterprises. As of April 24, a total of 9,667 workers in state-owned enterprises in the city participated in study groups, 5,891 received short-term training (ranging from three days to one month), 681 were newspaper correspondents, 1,548 joined singing teams, 720 joined Yangko teams, 476 joined basketball teams, 80 joined music teams, 431 joined drama troupes, and 270 joined Peking opera troupes. The drama troupes performed 35 times, and created scripts such as "The Liberated Arsenal," "Generator No. 6," "Two Sesame Cakes," "No Longer Suffering," "New Attitude," "Red Flag Dance," and "Before and After Liberation," which closely reflected the lives of the workers themselves and were very popular with the audience. During this period, a total of 84 blackboards, 34 wall newspapers, and 13 mimeographed or letterpress worker tabloids were published, with a total circulation of more than 2,000 copies. There are already 32 worker libraries with 6,245 books and periodicals. The workers are very enthusiastic about learning, and some automatically donate money to buy books. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also reprinted a large number of "Labor University Resolutions" and "Workers' Movement Documents," forwarded many song sheets and books, and held a half-month training class for worker cultural and recreational cadres, inviting comrades from three cultural and art troupes as teachers, and personally went to various factories to help with cultural and recreational activities. In addition, the comrades of the working group often gathered one or two hundred workers for large classes after work. The content of worker education mainly includes "The Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party of China," "New Democracy Economics," and the current situation. On April 21, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions gathered 232 workers from seven units and held a study test, from which it can be seen that the achievements in current affairs education are greater, but the most basic class education is still very poor, and class education must be strengthened in the future.

In the study and recreational activities, a number of deviations in workers' thinking have been corrected a lot. For example, the extreme democratization of factory management has been or is being overcome, and the egalitarianism in wage issues is also being further corrected. Many study groups have also been established among workers in private factories and workers in various trades. Larger factories also conduct two hours of study after get off work every night, and some also attend large classes.

Regarding the wage issue, since February, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has assisted the administration in proposing a wage distribution plan for state-owned enterprises. Considering that there were many objections from workers after the wage distribution, it also worked with the CCP Municipal Committee, the Municipal People's Government Research Office, and other relevant departments to form a wage research committee. Research groups were established in various factories to conduct investigations and studies. By April 15, based on the spirit of the Labor University Resolution, in accordance with the specific situation of Beiping, and with reference to the standards of Northeast China and Jinan, a new wage plan was drafted, which will be announced after discussion by relevant parties. The wage issue in private factories is also under study; however, appropriate mediation is carried out for labor-capital disputes that have already occurred. In the past four months, a total of 47 labor-capital disputes have been mediated in the city, and some have specifically assisted in the formulation of new labor insurance regulations and labor discipline. According to existing general feedback, the results of the mediation are still good.

The focus of worker welfare work is to vigorously run worker consumer cooperatives in state-owned enterprises, and secondly, to restore other old welfare undertakings (labor insurance, etc.). In early February, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions added a cooperative department to begin leading the establishment of cooperatives in various factories. As of April 15, 48 cooperatives had been established (including 8 agency staff cooperatives), with 87,403 members (including 31,116 workers, 41,642 adult family members, and 14,645 children). Each person has one share, and each share is five jin of millet, totaling more than 437,000 jin of share capital. During this period, grain distribution alone reached more than 3.25 million jin. All members suffered 5.3 million yuan less from merchants' intermediate exploitation during this period. This time, due to the urgency of preventing workers from being affected by market prices, a blitz approach was adopted, so there was a lack of sufficient publicity and deliberation. It is currently urgent to step up necessary publicity and explanation, and improve cooperative affairs, so that the working masses can understand the significance and prospects of the cooperative, and achieve the goal of uniting workers and benefiting workers. Since the establishment of the society, there have been many problems, and the solution of the share capital turnover problem is the most urgent; if this problem is not solved, as prices rise, the purchasing power of the share capital will gradually decrease, which will inevitably affect the development of the business. The way to solve this is to use the share capital of the consumer society as production.

In late April, the CCP Municipal Committee, the Municipal Government's Bureau of State-Owned Enterprises, and the Pingjin Railway Bureau successively convened symposiums of representatives of state-owned factories, symposiums of worker representatives of private factories, symposiums of railway worker representatives, symposiums of takeover representatives and worker representatives of municipal enterprises, and joint meetings of factory directors, managers, military control representatives, and trade union directors of state-owned enterprises, which greatly promoted the construction opinions of Beiping workers, and initially resolved the rational reform of state-owned factories and enterprise institutions, the rational adjustment of personnel and wages, the formulation of production plans, the establishment of factory management committees and factory security work, as well as further promoting worker welfare, improving labor-capital relations in private factories, in order to restore and develop production to support the national liberation war and other issues. After these meetings, with the active participation of workers, by May 6, 14 state-owned enterprises had set out one-year production plans, and 29 major enterprises had discussed the establishment of factory management committees. The trade union and the municipal government also worked together to determine the establishment of clinics in various factories and to prepare for the establishment of workers' children's schools. The Pingjin Railway Bureau has formulated dozens of plans and measures for worker welfare undertakings. The tap water company, which has the most complex organization and the most redundant personnel, has begun to streamline its organization and redundant personnel. Under this situation, the workers' production enthusiasm has been further improved, and nine workers of the telecommunications bureau completed the renovation of 150 automatic switchboard projects in 17 days, creating a new record for the project. Factory security work has been regarded as equally important as production work and has been rapidly carried out. Various enterprises and factories have generally established security committees, worker pickets, factory protection teams, air defense committees and other organizations to actively work. The tram company suffered the burning of 58 trams by bandits and special agents, but in anger, the workers especially strengthened security work, and decided to complete the task of 80 trams by "July 1st" and restore 100 trams to operation on the October Revolution Day.

According to Comrade Xiao Ming, director of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: generally speaking, the Beiping workers' movement has been steadily advancing for four months, the leadership has been tightly controlled, and the work has achieved initial results. However, the method of worker representative meetings has not been fully used, and democracy has not been fully developed, which is a shortcoming in the work during this period. At present, it is urgent to carry out democratic movement. In terms of work steps, according to Comrade Xiao Ming, it is planned to draw a part of the capable cadres, from top to bottom, line by line to conduct investigation and research, plan and prepare to first establish the municipal trade union of the line, and then establish the branch trade union under the municipal trade union of the line. In this way, all labor-capital disputes that occur in the line will be transferred from the bottom up to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for unified leadership and handling. In this way, the workers' movement can avoid the phenomenon of inconsistent steps and multiple chaos within the scope of the city. Now, in order to adapt to this work task, the organizational structure of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is also undergoing changes.

    四个月来的北平职工运动
    本报记者  赵纯
    【本报讯】：四个月来，北平职工运动稳步前进，已获初步成绩。从发动工人协助接管到复工、到迎接“五一”的生产竞赛，北平工人逐步提高了阶级觉悟与政治水平，初步树立了新的劳动态度，发挥了生产热情与创造性。在完成支前与建设的突击任务上，显示出他们的巨大力量。七十兵工厂在短期内完成修炮、造枪、制出大批弹药的艰巨任务。平津被服厂解放以来已制成三十万套以上的夏服。长辛店铁路工厂曾于一周内完成了过去一个月始能完成的一万块夹板。四○汽车厂修好百余部汽车随军南下，电车公司“五一”出车百辆的计划于四月二十日即已提前完成，现又为再建百辆而努力。以各种生产纪录说，部分已超过日伪时期，大部超过解放前。例如长辛店建立场刘宝荣组剁道背，过去九个工只剁九米，现在则最高剁到八十米点二。在节省原料减少浪费上，七十兵工厂一所冲压部过去制造枪榴弹加强罩，一个工出废品八十八个，现在已减至三十一个。创造发明方面，长辛店工人与工程师合作炼出了矽铁，电车公司电气工人创造用石棉纸制成隔电板，代替舶来品。七十兵工厂与其他厂也有不少技术上的改良与创造。
    北平全市属于公营企业方面的产业工人约六万余。私营工厂工人据已有统计为一万三千七百四十三人，行业工人尚无完整数字。北平解放前，中共市委会工委会于良乡开办一期半月的职工干部训练班，郊区解放后即集中大批干部，组成三十九个工作组，分赴各区各厂矿进行工作，并给入城工作创造不少经验。及至全市解放，工作组在十九个主要企业与二十个区里的工作，即分期计划逐步展开。“二七”纪念大会上市总工会筹委会成立，全市工运更进一步加强了领导。以保证接管、恢复改造并发展生产为目标，公私兼顾劳资两利为方针，积极推进工会工作。
    在组织工作中，首先着重公营企业的产业工会，其次私营工厂工会，再次行业工会。公营企业中又首先着重于市政企业如电力、电信、电车、自来水等。解放后，第一个月，三十三个公营企业中，绝大部分建立起工会筹委会。至四月底止，已全部成立正式职工会。据现有统计，六万余公营企业的产业工人，属于铁路系统的一万九千人，参加工会者已占百分之八十以上。其余四万一千一百八十人中，已经组织起来的有三万三千二百四十二人，亦占百分之八十以上。其中有四个单位甚至达到百分之百。在组织过程中，首先停止黄色工会，国民党御用工会的活动，宣布其各种罪行，使工人群众认识这些反动组织的真面目，从而体会到今天组织自己的工会的重要性。同时，一方面压制厂内旧的官僚统治人物的反动气焰，一方面克服工人中歧视一般职员，“不要职员加入工会”的偏向，加强了职员与工人的团结。迄四月二十四日止，全市私营工厂工人已组织者四千一百二十七人，行业工人已组织者一万一千七百九十七人。这里的组织工作一般的都是与恢复生产、调解劳资纠纷、调整工资结合进行的。
    职工教育，除了前面说过的大会方式外，在公营企业里，还普遍开展了学习运动与文化娱乐活动。至四月二十四日止，全市公营企业职工，参加学习小组的共九千六百六十七人，受短期训练的（三天至一个月不等）五千八百九十一人，作报纸通讯员的六百八十一人，加入歌咏队的一千五百四十八人，秧歌队七百二十人，篮球队四百七十六人，音乐队八十人，话剧团四百三十一人，平剧团二百七十一人。话剧团演出三十五次，创作剧本如“解放了的兵工厂”、“第六号发电机”、“两个烧饼”、“不再受气”、“新态度”、“红旗舞”、“解放前后”等，亲切反映了工人自己的生活，很受观众欢迎。这一时期，共出黑板报八十四个，墙报三十四个，油印或铅印职工小报十三种，共发行两千余份。职工图书馆已有三十二处，书刊六千二百四十五册。工人们学习热情很高，有的自动捐钱购买图书。市总工会筹委会亦大量翻印了“劳大决议”、“工运文献”，转发了很多歌片书刊，举办了半月一期的职工文娱干部训练班，邀请了三个文工团的同志作教员，且亲到各厂具体帮助文娱活动。此外，工作组同志还于下工后，常常集合一百二百工人上大课。职工教育内容，主要为“中国革命与中国共产党”、“新民主主义经济”目前形势。四月二十一日，市总工会筹委会从七个单位召集来二百三十二个工人，曾举行了一次学习测验，从中可以看出时事教育上成绩较大，而最基本的阶级教育却还很差，今后须加强阶级教育。
    在学习与文娱活动中，工人思想上的若干偏向获得不少纠正。如对工厂管理上的极端民主化思想，已经或正在克服，在工资问题上的平均主义思想也在进一步纠正中。在私营工厂工人与行业工人中，也建立了不少学习小组。较大的厂子每晚下班后且作两小时学习，也有的上大课。
    关于工资问题，自二月份起，市总工会筹委会曾协助行政提出公营企业发薪方案，复鉴于发薪后工人异议颇多，乃又会同中共市委与市人民政府研究室及各有关部门。组成工资研究委员会。并于各厂设立研究组，进行调查研究，至四月十五日，根据劳大决议精神，按照北平具体情况，参考东北及济南等地的标准，拟出一新工资方案，待有关方面研讨后即可公布。私营工厂工资问题亦在研究；但对已发生之劳资纠纷则予以适当调解。四个月来，全市共调解劳资纠纷四十七件，有的并具体协助订立了新的劳动保险条例与劳动纪律。调解结果，据现有一般的反映尚称良好。
    职工福利工作的重点，是大力举办公营企业的职工消费合作社，其次是对其他旧日已有的福利事业（劳动保险等）也正恢复中。二月初，市总工会筹委会添设合作部，开始领导各厂建立合作社，迄四月十五日止，已建立了四十八社（包括八个机关员工社在内），社员八万七千四百零三人（内职工三万一千一百十六人，成人家属四万一千六百四十二人，小孩一万四千六百四十五人），每人一股，每股小米五斤，共计股金米四十三万七千余斤。这一时期，仅粮食配售即达三百二十五万余斤。全体社员在此期间少受商人中间剥削五百三十万余元。此次建社，由于急于使工人不受市场物价影响，采用突击方式，故缺乏较充分之宣传酝酿。目前亟须加紧进行必要的宣传解释，并改进社务，使工人群众认识合作社的意义与前途，达到团结工人、造福工人的目的。建社迄今，其中问题颇多，而以股金周转问题的解决最为迫切；这问题如不解决，随着物价上涨，股金购买力逐渐降低，势必影响业务的发展。解决的道路，应该是使用消费社的股金兼作生产。
    四月下旬，中共市委、市府公营企业局及平津铁路局先后分别召开的公营工厂代表座谈会，私营工厂工人代表座谈会、铁路职工代表座谈会、市营各企业机构接管代表及职工代表座谈会、公营企业厂长、经理、军管代表工会主任联席会上，大大发挥了北平职工的建设意见，并初步解决了公营工厂企业机构的合理改革、人事和工资的合理调整、生产计划的制订、工厂管理委员会与工厂保卫工作的建立以及进一步举办职工福利，改善私营工厂劳资关系，以恢复发展生产支授全国解放战争等问题。这些会后，在工人积极参加下，迄五月六日已有十四个公营企业订出了一年生产计划，有二十九个主要企业讨论成立工厂管理委员会。职工会并与市府协同确定在各厂建立医务所，筹办职工子弟学校。平津铁路局已拟定了十数种职工福利事业的计划与办法。机构庞杂冗员最多的自来水公司已着手精减机构与冗员。在此情形下，工人生产积极性益形提高，电信局九个工人于十七天内改装一百五十门自动交换机工程；创造了工程新纪录。工厂保卫工作已被视为与生产工作同等重要而迅速展开，各企业工厂已普遍建立保卫委员会、工人纠察队、护厂队、防空委员会等组织，积极工作。电车公司曾遭匪特焚毁电车五十八辆，但工人们于愤恨中，特别加强了保卫工作，并决定于“七一”完成电车八十辆的任务，十月革命节重新恢复百辆电车的出厂。
    据市总工会筹委会主任萧明同志谈：北平工运，四个月来一般的说是稳步前进，领导上掌握得较紧，工作获得了初步成绩。但职工代表会议的方式尚未充分使用，民主性发挥不够，这是这一时期工作中的缺点。目前亟须开展民主运动。在工作步骤上，据萧明同志谈，今后打算抽出一部分得力干部，自上而下，一行一行地进行调查研究，有计划地有准备地先成立该行市工会，而后成立该行市工会下的分工会。这样，该行所有发生的劳资纠纷问题，都自下而上的转到市总工会来统一领导处理。这样就能使工运在全市范围内避免步骤不一致的与多头混乱的现象。现在，为了适应这种工作任务，市总工会的组织机构亦正变革中。
