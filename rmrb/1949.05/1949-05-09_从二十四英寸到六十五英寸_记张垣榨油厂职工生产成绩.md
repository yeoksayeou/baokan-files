From Twenty-Four Inches to Sixty-Five Inches
——A Record of the Production Achievements of the Zhangyuan Oil Press Factory Workers
By Our Correspondent Li Yi

This year, the spring in the border region seems particularly rich.

"Spring has returned to the world; spring has returned to Zhang and Xuan." This sentence, for the more than 200,000 people of Zhang and Xuan, especially for the tens of thousands of workers in Zhang and Xuan, has an exceptionally profound meaning. The reason is that this city, which had already been liberated (August 1945 to October 1946) and belonged to the people, underwent more than two years of cruel rule by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, giving the workers of Zhang and Xuan the most severe education, making them truly recognize the enemy, distinguish between light and darkness.

They resent the shameless Kuomintang bandit gangs for the exploitation and massacres they inflicted upon them during the long, gloomy years of the past.

They also feel extraordinary excitement, excited that they have returned to the light and are nurtured by the light forever! The days of suffering are no more.

They have transformed their infinite hatred for the Kuomintang bandit gangs into a vital force for actively carrying out production and construction for the new China and for the final victory of the People's Liberation War.

The production of the Zhangyuan Oil Press Factory in the past four months vividly illustrates this point.

The thirty-odd workers of the Zhangyuan Oil Press Factory have created outstanding production achievements in the four months since liberation. According to statistics, the average oil production per person per shift of eight hours has increased from 19.325 jin in January, when it was first liberated, to 65.18 jin in March, and further to 94.93 jin in the first half of April. The total monthly output has increased from 10,030 jin in 519 workdays in twenty days in January, to 56,850 jin in 683 workdays in twenty-nine days in March, and further to 41,000 jin in thirteen days in the first half of April.

Welcoming "Red May" is a call to battle for them.

They answered this call with practical actions of increased production. In April, thirty-five workers, working two shifts of seventeen hours, operating three horizontal presses, increased the highest output to 65 inches (each inch of oil is 70 jin, the same below), that is, 4,550 jin. Compared with January when it was first liberated, twenty-two workers, operating two horizontal presses, working two shifts of seventeen hours, the highest oil production of 24.28 inches, that is, 1,400 jin, has increased more than threefold.

From twenty-four inches to sixty-five inches, this is not just a change in numbers, but marks a great revolution in the political awareness of the entire factory's workers. This is mainly because they have eliminated the contradictions between workers and the guild factions among workers, which the factory deliberately provoked during the Kuomintang bandit gangs' rule in order to control the workers. All the workers, with the consciousness of masters, for the sake of building their own factory, for the sake of supporting the final victory of the national revolutionary war led by the Communist Party of their own class, have achieved unprecedented unity. The mutual struggle between workers and among workers during the Kuomintang bandit gangs' rule has been transformed into a force for jointly discussing how to improve production methods and how to implement scientific management.

Workers Liu Quanhai, Cao Baogui, and Pang Ruiming, who were in charge of stir-frying materials, used four stir-frying pans in March and could only stir-fry 38 bags of materials (each bag is 90 kilograms) in eight hours per shift. After the start of the April competition, in order to supply a large amount of oil materials, they automatically worked two hours overtime, reaching a maximum of 63 bags. They have reached the most intensive level in the use of manpower. They transported twelve large bags at a time from the material screening room, which is 150 meters away from the stir-frying pan, on light rails using a small cart. Using four stir-frying pans, they stir-fried in three batches. After the second pot was stir-fried, and the third bag was poured into the stir-frying pan, only one person was in charge of the stir-frying pan and the pulverizer (which originally required at least one person each). The remaining two people went to transport materials. Their tense and heavy labor throughout the day was entirely due to their political consciousness. They said, "The factory is no longer producing for the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The factory has become our own home, and production is for the people themselves."

They also made bold and successful improvements in the method of stir-frying materials. During the Japanese occupation, stir-frying sesame seeds required at least forty minutes, and rapeseed required thirty minutes, but now it generally does not exceed fifteen minutes. They first studied the purpose of stir-frying materials, which is to break the cells of the raw materials so that the oil is easy to flow when using a machine press, and at the same time to coagulate the protein contained in the raw materials so that the oil is purer. If the stir-frying time is too long and the water is completely removed, it is not necessarily good, and there is no great need. Because in fact, when the oil material passes through the screw of the press, it must be sprayed with appropriate steam in order to apply the maximum pressure in the press cylinder and squeeze out the oil contained in the material. The workers in the oil pressing department took consistent action with the stir-frying department. On the crushed materials with a higher moisture content than before, they adopted the method of spraying less steam and increasing the degree of evaporation to increase the heat of the material. As a result, in a certain space in the press cylinder, due to the moderate humidity of the material, the capacity was large and the pressure was high, achieving the result of less material and more oil. In the past, when the water was almost completely stir-fried, the result of spraying too much steam through the screw was that the oil material in the press cylinder was too wet, and it was easy to get out of the cylinder when too much pressure was applied. Therefore, in a certain period of time, the amount of raw materials used was large, and the amount of oil produced was small.

The workers in the stir-frying department and the oil pressing department used this method to achieve the savings of more than one-sixth of the raw materials used to produce one kilogram of crude oil in April compared to January when it was first liberated, and the electricity used was nearly one-third less than in January.

Technician Chen Shaowen is a model recognized by the entire factory. He automatically led the workers in the repair shop to repair the No. 3 horizontal press, which had been dismantled and repaired more than twenty times during the Kuomintang bandit gangs' rule, but had never been repaired. The problem with that horizontal press was that the press knife was short, the center axis was uneven, and the press top hoops were inconsistent. Repairing such parts usually requires a lathe and oxygen, but the repair shop did not have these two things. After repeated research, they used short rivets to insert steel sheets to make up for the worn-out press knife, and then used a file to flatten it; they used a file instead of a lathe to file the uneven press top hoops. After three days of repairs, the No. 3 machine was finally repaired. After starting the machine, it produced two-fifths more crude oil than other horizontal presses.

In order to improve production and welcome the arrival of "Red May," the factory proposed to the workers in the repair shop a plan to build a light railway of about 150 meters long from the material screening room to the stir-frying room. The materials needed for this project, such as steel rails and sleepers, were available, but the transport cart only had wheels, no frame, and no tile frame. Worker Chen Shaowen led the six workers in the repair shop. After repeated research, they used waste materials "three-way" and iron pipes, iron plates, and within five days, they successfully completed the decoration work of the light transport vehicle. The raw material transport rate from the material screening room to the stir-frying pan room was several times higher than before. Chen Shaowen said, "During the Kuomintang rule, I wandered around with a hammer every day, called work, just loafing around." He also said, "Now we are doing things for ourselves! We must show as much ability as we have." His words expressed the voice of all the workers in the oil press factory.

This kind of political awakening of the workers of the oil press factory can also be seen from another thing. Zhao Yushan, a worker in the oil pressing department, said, "During the Kuomintang rule, it was so strictly controlled. In the past year alone, the workers also moved away from him eighteen large barrels (each barrel is 360 jin) of oil. Now, even if the superiors don't care about us, we are not willing to take a little oil. Now we feel that taking things from the factory is a shameful thing."

Electrical worker Wei Wenjie said, "Now, in production, everyone wants to be stronger than everyone else. If you produce twenty inches of oil, I have to produce twenty-one inches. This energy is really hard to say where it comes from!"

The entire staff of the oil press factory, with such political awareness, in April, in twenty-four days, successfully completed the original plan to produce 84,000 crude oil in one month, creating a new record in the history of the oil press factory.

    从二十四英寸到六十五英寸
    ——记张垣榨油厂职工生产成绩
    本报记者  李翼
    今年塞上的春意显得特别浓厚。
    “春又回到了人间；春又回到了张、宣。”这句话，从张、宣二十余万人民，尤其是就张、宣千万个职工来说，其意味又觉得格外深长。原因是：这本来已经解放（一九四五年八月至一九四六年十月）属于人民的城市，经过了国民党匪帮两年多的惨酷统治，给予张、宣职工以最严酷的教育，使他们真正认清了敌我，辨明了谁是光明与黑暗。
    他们愤恨无耻的国民党匪帮，在以往漫长的、阴霾的岁月里，加诸于他们的压榨与屠杀。
    他们又感到非凡的兴奋，兴奋的是他们又重为光明而且是永远的为光明所抚育了！痛苦的日子已不再有。
    他们已经将对国民党匪帮的无限愤恨，化成了为新中国、为人民解放战争的最后胜利，而积极进行生产与建设的有生力量。
    在张垣榨油厂，过去四个月的生产，最鲜明的说明了这一点。
    张垣榨油厂的三十多位职工，在解放后四个多月的生产中，已经创造了卓越的生产成绩。据统计，平均每人一个班八小时的产油量，已由一月份刚解放时的十九点三二五市斤，三月份的六十五点一八市斤增至四月上半月的九十四点九三市斤。全月产量，已由一月份二十天的五百一十九个工，出油一万零三十市斤，三月份二十九天的六百八十三个工，出油五万六千八百五十市斤，增至四月上半月十三天的四万一千市斤。
    迎接“红五月”，对他们来说，是一个战斗的召唤。
    他们以实际的增产行动回答了这召唤。四月份三十五个职工，两班十七小时的工作，开动三部横榨，最高产量已增至六十五英寸（每英寸油七十市斤下同）即四千五百五十市斤。较诸一月份刚解放时，二十二个职工，开动两部横榨，两班十七小时的工作，最高产油量二十四英寸点二八，即一千四百市斤，提高至三倍以上。
    从二十四英寸到六十五英寸，这不单是一个数字上的改变，而是标明着全厂职工在政治上的一次大革命。这主要在于他们消除了国民党匪帮统治时期，厂方为了统治工人，故意挑拨职工间的矛盾，及工人间的行会派别。全体职工，以主人翁的自觉，为着建设自己的工厂，为着支援由本阶级的政党共产党所领导的全国革命战争的最后胜利，达到了空前未有的大团结。将国民党匪帮统治时期，职工间及工人间的相互斗争，变成了共同商议如何改进生产方法，如何实行科学管理的力量。
    炒料工友刘全海、曹宝贵、庞瑞明三人，三月份时，使用四付炒锅，每班八小时的工作，仅能炒料三十八包（每包九十公斤）。四月竞赛开始后，他们为了供应大量的油料，自动加工两小时，最高已达六十三包。他们在人力的使用上，达到了最紧张的程度。他们在轻便铁轨上，从相距炒锅一百五十米的筛料房里，用小车一次运来十二大包，使用四付炒锅，分三次炒，到第二锅炒完，第三包倒入炒锅之后，即只有一人分管炒锅和粉碎机（这本来最少各需一人），其余二人即去运料。整日紧张、沉重的劳动，他们完全是出于政治上的自觉。他们表示：“工厂已不再是为国民党匪帮生产了，工厂已成了自己的家，生产已是为着人民自己。”
    在炒料的方法上，他们也做了大胆而且是成功的改进。日寇统治时期，炒葫麻最少需要四十分钟，菜籽要三十分钟，而现在一般不超过十五分钟。他们首先研究了炒料的目的，是要使原料细胞破裂，使用机器压榨时，油脂易于流动，同时使原料所含蛋白质凝结，出油较纯洁，炒的时间如果过长，水分去的净，并不一定好，也没有多大的必要。因为事实上当油料经过压榨机的绞笼时，还得喷以适当的蒸汽，才能在榨缸里施以最大的压力，榨出料中所含的油脂。榨油部的工友们与炒料部采取了一致的行动，在含水分较前为大的碎料上，采取了少喷汽，加大蒸度，使料的热度增高的办法，其结果是在榨缸里的一定空间，由于料的湿润适度，因而容量多，压力大，达到了料少出油多，而在以前，炒时将水分炒到几乎净尽，经过绞笼时过多喷汽的结果，油料在榨缸里，由于过湿，一施过大压力，即易出缸。因而在一定的时间里，所用的原料多，所出的油就少。
    炒料部和榨油部的工友们，就是以这样方法达到了在四月份生产一斤原油所用原料，较一月份刚解放时节省六分之一强，所用电力较一月份节省三分之一弱。
    技术工人陈绍文，是全厂公认的模范。他自动带领修理室的工友，修好了国民党匪帮统治时期，拆卸修理达二十余次，始终未能修好的三号横榨机，那部横榨机的毛病，在于榨刀短，中轴不平，榨顶箍不一致，修复这样的机件，普通要用旋床和氧气，而这两种东西恰好修理室没有，他们经过了多次的钻研，以短铆钉镶上钢片，补足了被磨坏的榨刀，然后用锉打平；以锉代替旋床，锉平了上下不一致的榨顶箍，经过了三天的修理，三号机终于修好，开车后且较其他横榨机多出五分之二的原油。
    为了提高生产，迎接“红五月”的来临，厂方向修理室的工友们提出了于筛料房至炒料房间，修建一道约一百五十米长的轻便铁路计划。这工程所需要的材料，如钢轨、枕木等都有，只是输送小车仅有车轮，没有车架，也没有瓦架。工人陈绍文，带领修理室的六位工友，经过三番五次的钻研，利用废料“三通”及铁管、铁板，不及五天，即顺利完成了轻便输送车的装修工作。使着从筛料房到炒锅房间，原料的输送率，较前提高数倍。陈绍文说：“国民党统治时期，我天天拿着锤子到处溜，叫做活，就泡蘑茹。”他又说：“现在是为自己做事啦！有多大本事，就要施展多大的本事。”他的话正说出了榨油厂全体职工的心声。
    榨油厂职工们这种政治上的觉醒，从另外一件事情上也可以看出来。榨油部工友赵玉山说：“国民党统治时期，管得那样严，单去年一年间，工友们也还搬走了他十八大桶（每桶三百六十市斤）油。现在即使上级不管我们，我们都不肯去拿一点油。现在我们觉得，拿厂中的东西是可耻的事情。”
    电气工人魏文杰说：“现在在生产上，谁也想比谁强，你出二十英寸油，我非出二十一英寸不可。这一股劲真说不清是那里来的！”
    榨油厂的全体职工，就是以这样政治上的自觉，在四月份，以二十四天的时间，即胜利的完成了原定一个月生产八万四千原油的计划，创造了榨油厂有史以来新的纪录。
