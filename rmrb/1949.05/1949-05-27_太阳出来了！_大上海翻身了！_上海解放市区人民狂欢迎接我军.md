Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: The Shanghai urban area south of Suzhou Creek is immersed in jubilation. The vast number of workers, students, and citizens are enthusiastically welcoming the People's Liberation Army. On the 25th, as the PLA advanced into the city at dawn, the roadsides and windows were filled with welcoming crowds. At eight o'clock in the morning, processions of workers and students appeared on the streets. Workers from a certain factory stuck two large red flags on a truck, with the words "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" and "The Sun is Out!" written on them. When students passed PLA soldiers resting by the roadside, they presented each soldier with a flower of victory, and danced the Yangko with joy, singing the song "Our Troops Have Arrived."

The PLA soldiers immediately responded happily, singing "We are the People's Soldiers." A certain regiment of the PLA rested in the back street of the South Railway Station. This usually quiet slum immediately erupted in joy. Workers, vendors, and their families all poured into the streets, surrounding the soldiers. Many people earnestly requested the PLA soldiers to go to their homes to dry their clothes that were soaked during the fighting, but were politely declined by the soldiers. The streets, which were gloomy and terrifying the day before, are now filled with festive joy. The walls, doors, windows, telephone poles, trams, cars, and pedicabs are all covered with slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!" "Great Shanghai Has Been Liberated!" On Shaanxi South Road (formerly Avenue du Roi Albert), the reactionary propaganda banners written by the Kuomintang reactionaries were taken down by the people and replaced with bright and eye-catching banners welcoming the People's Liberation Army. On Lin Sen Road (formerly Avenue Joffre), many citizens hung red flags. A group of elementary school students in Xujiahui also carried portraits of Chairman Mao and excitedly shouted slogans such as "Long Live the People's Liberation Army" on the streets. The main urban areas of Shanghai are filled with laughter and songs everywhere. Although gunshots can still be heard from the north of Suzhou Creek from time to time, they are drowned out by the deafening sounds of gongs and drums.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: On the day of liberation (the 25th), public utilities in the Shanghai urban area south of Suzhou Creek were quickly restored one after another. Shanghai Electric Power, Water, and Gas Companies continue to supply electricity and water to the city. The tramcars and buses of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company and the French-owned Tramways and Electricity Company of Shanghai mostly left the factory to operate at 6:30 am on the 26th. Traffic on the Huangpu River is also gradually resuming. The main wharves along the Bund south of Jinling East Road, such as Shiliupu, Nanmatou, and Dongjiadu Wharf, have all returned to normal.

　　太阳出来了！
  　大上海翻身了！
  　上海解放市区人民狂欢迎接我军
    【新华社上海二十六日电】苏州河以南已解放的上海市区浸沉在狂欢中。广大的工人学生及市民都狂热地欢迎人民解放军。二十五日拂晓，解放军向市区挺进时，马路两侧及楼窗口，就聚满了欢迎的人群。早上八点钟，马路上一队队的工人学生的游行行列就出现了。某厂工人在卡车上插着两面大红旗，上面写着：“中国共产党万岁！”“太阳出来了！”学生们经过在马路旁休息的解放军面前时，给每一个战士献了一朵胜利花，并且欢狂地扭着秧歌，唱着“我们的队伍来了”的歌曲。
    解放军的战士们也立即快乐地应合着他们，唱着“我们是人民的子弟兵”。解放军某团在南车站后街休息，这一冷静的贫民区立即欢腾起来，工人、小贩和他们的家属全部涌到街头，把战士们重重围起来。许多人恳切地要求解放军战士们到他们家里去烤干他们在作战中湿透了的衣服，但遭到战士们的婉言辞谢。前天还是阴森森可怕的街道，现在已充满了节日的欢欣。墙壁上、门窗上、电杆上、电车上、汽车上、三轮车上到处贴满了“毛主席万岁！”“向人民解放军致敬！”“大上海翻身了！”等标语。陕西南路（原亚尔培路）上悬挂的国民党反动派写着反动宣传标语的横布条都被人民取下，换上鲜艳夺目的欢迎人民解放军的横幅。林森路（原霞飞路）上，很多市民挂上了红旗。徐家汇的一群小学生也抬着毛主席画像在马路上兴奋地高呼“解放军万岁”等口号。上海主要市区，到处充满着欢笑和歌声。虽然苏州河北还不时传来枪声，但它被喧天的锣鼓声淹没了。
    【新华社上海二十六日电】上海苏州河以南市区在解放的当日（二十五日）各公用事业即先后迅速恢复。上海电力、自来水与煤气等公司照常供应市内外水电。英商上海电车公司与法商电车公司之各路有轨无轨电车及公共汽车，于二十六日晨六时半，即大部出厂行驶。黄浦江上的交通也逐渐恢复。自金陵东路以南沿外滩的各主要码头，如十六铺及南码头、董家渡码头等，都已恢复常态。
