Several Explanations on the Policy of Developing Production for Labor-Capital Benefit

    “Develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital.” This is the general principle of our New Democratic economic and labor policies as instructed by Chairman Mao. This principle is determined from the long-term interests of the Chinese working class and the long-term interests of the Chinese people. It also conforms to the interests of all private capitalists engaged in beneficial national livelihood under the New Democratic regime. Therefore, "develop production, benefit both labor and capital" should become the starting point for labor and capital to solve all problems in private enterprises.
    I think there are two aspects to the meaning of "develop production, benefit both labor and capital." On the one hand, only by developing production can we achieve the benefit of both labor and capital; on the other hand, only by implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital can we achieve the goal of developing production. Recently, in worker and capitalist forums and individual exchanges of views, it has been discovered that some workers and capitalists have some doubts and concerns about the above two aspects of "develop production, benefit both labor and capital." Therefore, I feel it is necessary to explain them.

  (I) Why can only developing production achieve labor-capital benefit?

    All conscious workers understand that only by developing production can the fundamental interests of the working class be realized. However, some workers with a lower degree of consciousness have some doubts and concerns about this issue, and we Communists who represent the interests of the working class need to explain it to them.
    The first question: Some people say that the Communist Party's method of liberating farmers is very good and simple, that is, to distribute the property of the landlords equally to the farmers. Why can't the property of the capitalists be distributed to the workers, but instead, we must implement the development of production to improve the lives of the workers? In fact, this reason is very simple and obvious. The landlord's property is mainly land. Land can be cultivated separately and was originally rented to farmers for cultivation. After the land is distributed to the farmers, they will no longer be exploited by the landlords and will definitely work harder. Therefore, the result of equal land distribution can improve agricultural production. When farmers become rich, the things they need will also increase day by day. The needs and purchasing power of hundreds of millions of farmers have increased, and the Chinese domestic market has expanded rapidly. This will inevitably promote the development of Chinese industry, and this development will often not keep up with the increase in farmers' needs. Then both state-owned and private enterprises will have a broad market and great development prospects.
    The capitalist's property is mainly factories. Factories cannot be divided, and if they are divided, they cannot be produced. For example, if the machines in the factory are dismantled and distributed to the workers, if you divide a wheel, he divides a belt, the entire machine and the entire factory will be destroyed. How can we continue production? For example, a shop, if its front counter and back warehouse are divided up, how can it continue to operate? Won't we workers and shop assistants lose our jobs? Therefore, if workers implement the "division of property" method of farmers, it will not only be useless, but also greatly harmful. Society will regress and living standards will decline. Therefore, workers must never divide the capitalist's factory. On the contrary, they must work hard to protect the factory and improve production, which will be beneficial to the workers.
    The second question existing among some workers is: Capitalists make profits by exploiting the surplus value of our workers. As a result of our efforts to improve production and develop production, the more capitalists exploit us, the more money they make. It is beneficial to the capitalists, so why is it beneficial to our workers? This question is not difficult to answer. First of all, the reasons why our workers have always lived in pain are no more than the following three points: First, they suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; second, they suffered from the direct oppression and exploitation of capitalists in private enterprises; third, Chinese industry is underdeveloped and too few things are produced. Now, the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism represented by the Kuomintang has been completely overthrown in the liberated areas, and workers are no longer subject to their oppression and exploitation. The current government is a people's government led by the working class. Under the people's government, workers can freely organize trade unions to protect their own interests, and the people's government will promulgate various laws and regulations to protect workers' interests, oppose capitalists' oppression of workers, and limit capitalists' excessive exploitation of workers. Workers don't need to have any doubts about this. Therefore, the first reason why workers lived in pain in the past has been eliminated, and the second reason has also been eliminated by half. The remaining half (the surplus value produced by workers in private enterprises exploited by capitalists) cannot be eliminated in the current historical stage, and this should be tolerated. What we must strive to eliminate now is the third reason—undeveloped production. It is precisely because China's industrial production is underdeveloped and all daily necessities are lacking throughout the country, resulting in widespread poverty in the lives of the people across the country. In the past, the ruling class exploited the blood and sweat of the majority of working people to seek personal gain. In the midst of the extreme poverty of the vast majority of people, a few of them could live a life of enjoyment and corruption. After the working class becomes the master of the country, it must never exploit the majority of people for its own enjoyment like the ruling class in the past. On the contrary, it must do its best to improve the living standards of the people across the country. To do this, we can only work hard to develop production and prosper the economy. The working class must have the spirit of enduring hardship first and enjoying pleasure later, and work hard to be an example for the people of the country. Because China's economy is backward, the proportion of modern industry in the entire national economy is less than 10 percent. In order to greatly develop production, relying solely on the strength of state capital is far from enough. We must also use the enthusiasm of all legitimate private capital. In addition to the original private enterprises, we must also mobilize all possible private capital to invest in production so that industrial production can develop faster and the production of people's daily necessities will increase day by day. This is of course beneficial to capitalists, but it is also of greater benefit to the people's livelihood, and also of greater benefit to our working class. When production develops greatly, the lives of the working class will gradually improve. This is the benefit of developing production for the working class.

    Capitalists also have some questions and concerns about the issue of developing production to achieve labor-capital benefit. We, as Communists who represent the interests of the working class and the interests of all the people, and advocate "develop production, benefit both labor and capital," also have the responsibility to explain it.
    The first question is: Some people say that the Communist Party is a workers' party and will only protect the interests of the workers and will not take care of the interests of the capitalists. The money earned in the factory will be used to improve the lives of the workers. How can the capitalists make a profit? True, the Communist Party is a party of the working class, but as mentioned above, for the benefit of the working class and the benefit of the entire country, the most important thing now is to develop industry. If industry is not developed, not only will the living standards of the Chinese people not be improved, but also the Chinese nation will not be able to get rid of the shackles of imperialism economically. How can the lives of Chinese workers be improved? The reason why the Chinese working class can become the leading class of all the people is because it can represent the interests of all the people, and its interests are inseparable from the interests of all the people. If all the money earned by private enterprises is used to improve the lives of the workers, how can we accumulate capital, expand production, and develop industry? Workers with a high degree of class consciousness will never agree to do this. On the contrary, they will definitely advocate accumulating most of the money earned by the enterprise as capital for expanding production, and using an appropriate portion as the profit of the capitalists, so that the capitalists will have the interest to expand production. Therefore, the interests of capitalists and workers can be consistent on this point.
    The second question is, some people say that the Communist Party advocates communism. Today, talking about labor-capital benefit is just a deceptive trick. Tomorrow, our factories and enterprises will be confiscated. What benefits can we talk about for capitalists? True, the Communist Party advocates communism, but to achieve communism, we still need to go through a very long period. As mentioned earlier, China's characteristic is that its economic development is too backward. The proportion of industry and agriculture in the national economy, on a national scale, is about 10% for industry and 90% for agriculture. This economic situation is different from that of the Russian October Revolution and from that of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe today. Therefore, China not only cannot carry out a socialist revolution directly like Russia at that time, but also cannot start transitioning to socialism a few years after the victory of the revolution like the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, it will still need to go through a fairly long period of New Democratic construction to develop China's industry, so that China's economy can completely get rid of the shackles of imperialism, and the proportion of industry and agriculture in the entire national economy can gradually change, and the proportion of industry can reach a fairly high level. Without this change, without the great development of industry, not only can we not talk about implementing socialism, but also we cannot talk about the Chinese nation's true and thorough economic independence from imperialism. Therefore, after the victory of the revolution, the most important and basic issue in the lives of the people across the country will be to mobilize all the strength of the people across the country to develop production and build a new democratic society. This not only requires the firm struggle of all working people, but also requires all true national capitalists and national entrepreneurs to work together to achieve relatively rapid success. In the past, Chinese national capitalists were oppressed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and were always struggling in a state of atrophy. Chinese national entrepreneurs were always unable to breathe under layers of oppression or restrictions. Only now, after the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has been overthrown, and we have entered the New Democratic construction period, will all national capital enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood obtain truly reasonable and rapid development, and all entrepreneurs who are willing to work hard to develop national production can stretch their talents that are beneficial to the people, cooperate with workers to create and expand enterprises that are beneficial to the national livelihood, and make achievements in the cause of developing production and prospering the economy. Therefore, the policy of using developing production to achieve labor-capital benefit is not a deceptive trick, but a necessary and the only correct policy in the New Democratic construction period.
    From this it can be seen that only by developing production can we achieve the problem of labor-capital benefit. Workers do not need to doubt it, and capitalists have nothing to doubt or worry about. (⑴⑵)

  (II) Why can only implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital achieve the goal of developing production?

    This issue is not in doubt for conscious workers, because they recognize the historical conditions and historical tasks of China's New Democratic Revolution, and because they recognize the relationship between the various classes in China today. However, among some workers with a lower degree of consciousness, there are also some doubts that need to be explained in detail.
    Some workers think this way: In the past, we were severely oppressed and exploited by capitalists and could hardly live. Now that we are liberated, we should fight against the capitalists and ask them to take out more money to improve our lives. Why should we take care of their interests? Workers who hold this view do not know that the most important enemies of the Chinese people's liberation today are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Only by completely overthrowing these three enemies can the Chinese people truly gain liberation and begin to build their own New Democratic New China. Patriotic national capitalists have also been oppressed by these three enemies for a long time, so they have the opportunity to unite with our working class, peasant class, and petty bourgeoisie to oppose the common enemy today. After the victory of the revolution, during the construction period, it is also necessary to promote the active entrepreneurial spirit of national capitalists and jointly develop industry with our workers. Therefore, we should not regard the national bourgeoisie as enemies, but should unite them as friends. Of course, if they continue the past practice of oppressing workers and excessively exploiting workers, we will oppose it. The method is to adopt consultation, negotiation, the signing of treaties, asking the government for arbitration, and filing lawsuits with the court to obtain reasonable solutions. Our struggle against capitalists is still to achieve better unity. Secondly, workers who hold this view do not know that the highest interests of our Chinese working class and the entire people are to develop production, and we must encourage capitalists to participate in this cause of developing production. To make capitalists enthusiastic about operating and expanding production, it is necessary to make capitalists profitable, so our workers' economic demands cannot be too high; if they are too high, leading to capitalists not making money or even losing money, the result will inevitably be that capitalists are unwilling to actively operate, the enterprise collapses, and everyone becomes unemployed, which is not only unfavorable to capitalists, but also unfavorable to workers. Since our working class has become the master of the country, it should shoulder the important responsibility of developing production, prospering the economy, and gradually improving the living standards of the people. Therefore, the demands we make on capitalists now should not be based solely on the point of view of the workers' temporary welfare, but should take into account the legitimate interests of the entire development of production. We should not only think about living a good life in the present, but should pay attention to seeking long-term happiness. It is completely wrong to only care about the interests of capitalists and ignore the difficulties in the lives of workers. This will damage the workers' enthusiasm for production, which is unfavorable to the workers and unfavorable to the development of production and the prosperity of the economy. This right-leaning view must be opposed and overcome. However, if we only care about the temporary and one-sided interests of the workers and do not take into account the interests of the capitalists, it is equally wrong and equally harmful to the development of production and the prosperity of the economy, that is, it is harmful to the current and future interests of the working class.
    Of course, it is not easy for capitalists to understand the problem of only implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital can achieve the goal of developing production. Capitalists think this way: Our business is not good and we cannot make money. If we want to improve the lives of workers, how can we make money? Especially if we want to talk about democracy, workers will not obey orders, how can we improve production? This idea is first due to the fact that they do not know that in the past, they suffered from the oppression, exclusion, and annexation of imperialist dumping policies and bureaucratic capitalist monopoly policies. In addition, farmers were cruelly exploited by landlords and their purchasing power was very low. Of course, national capital factories had no market and their business was not good. Now that these oppressions have been removed, the market will expand day by day, sales will be broader day by day, national capital factories will have great development prospects, and will get appropriate profits. Yes, for the benefit of the entire national economic development, the state will restrict speculative undertakings that are harmful to the national economy, but this will only create more convenient development conditions for those productive undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy. Capitalists who hold this view, especially because they do not know that in the past, workers' enthusiasm for production must have been not high because they worked in a state of extremely painful life and being oppressed. Now, if the lives of workers are appropriately improved, so that workers will not feel threatened by hunger and cold every day, and management methods are appropriately improved, so that workers feel that they have gained a respected position, and also have the opportunity to express their opinions on improving production, workers' enthusiasm for production will be greatly improved, the quantity of production will increase, the quality will also improve, the business will be better day by day, and it will be possible to expand production and develop production.
    After such an explanation, I think that on the issue of only implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital can achieve the goal of developing production, there can be no doubts not only on the worker side, but also on the capitalist side.

  (III) How to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital

    A few days ago, when I was talking with Mr. Chen Yintang, the manager of Beiping Dahua Pottery Company, I said: Chairman Mao is good at posing questions, and each question is practical and pertinent. However, it is not easy to write a good article according to the questions he poses. To write such an article well, the first thing to do is to have the parties directly related to the topic write it themselves. Indeed, the workers and capitalists of Dahua Pottery Company have written this article with facts, and have written it roughly well. So, instead of writing an article out of thin air, I would rather introduce the facts they have already made.
    Regarding the situation of Beiping Dahua Pottery Company, which has been able to gradually improve production and gradually realize labor-capital benefit in less than three months after liberation, the newspaper has already reported in more detail a few days ago. It should be emphasized that improving production first relies on the efforts of the workers, because only laborers are the main body of production and can create all products. Therefore, the improvement of production in Dahua Pottery Company is first and foremost the credit of the hardworking labor of Dahua workers. But why can the enthusiasm of Dahua workers for labor be higher now than in the past? This cannot be explained only from within the Dahua workers, but from the victory of the entire working class and the Chinese people in the Chinese political struggle, and from the victory of the Chinese Communist Party's economic policy of "develop production, benefit both labor and capital." This victory has enabled Chen Yintang, the current manager of Dahua, to accept the principle of labor-capital benefit to a considerable extent and adopt an attitude of cooperation with the workers, thus helping to improve the enthusiasm of the workers. The main measures taken by the labor and capital parties of the company to implement the policy of benefiting labor and capital are as follows:
    (A) As soon as Beiping was liberated, on February 4, Manager Chen of the company increased investment, and the workers quickly resumed work and jointly planned to expand production. Now this plan is being realized step by step. In the Kuomintang era, an average of no more than two kilns of goods were burned per month. After liberation, five kilns were burned in March, and eight kilns can be burned in April.
    (B) Both labor and capital can take developing production as a prerequisite, and appropriately improve the lives of employees under the condition of taking care of the interests of production. Manager Chen saw that the workers' wages were too low (only two and a half to three and a half jin of millet per person per day excluding food), and they could not maintain their lives. In order to make the workers work with peace of mind, and in order to improve the workers' enthusiasm for production so as to produce more products, he started to increase wages and improve the lives of the workers. On the other hand, the workers also realized that the company is currently losing money, and if the wages are too high, the expenses will increase, and it will not be able to continue to operate. Therefore, they voluntarily set the wages lower (three and a half to five and a half jin of millet per day. Recently, it is planned to adjust it to four jin and one liang to seven and a half jin, and the food is provided by the factory), knowing that as long as production develops and the factory makes money, life can be gradually improved. This mutual care between labor and capital with the goal of doing a good job in production is the main prerequisite for realizing the policy of benefiting labor and capital.
    (C) The old management methods have been changed, and a factory management committee has been established, with the manager as the director and the worker representatives participating. All production, management, personnel transfer, wages, and welfare undertakings are submitted to the management committee for detailed discussion, so that the worker representatives can fully express their opinions. Therefore, all the problems decided by the management committee can be supported by all the workers, so there has been no labor dispute caused by the workers' dissatisfaction. At the same time, the workers feel that their position in production has changed, and they have been able to participate in production management, thus generating a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for production. This fact fully proves that the instruction pointed out by the Sixth Labor Congress that a production management committee can also be organized in private enterprises as long as the capitalists are willing is completely correct.
    (D) The capital side broke the old habits and prejudices of trying to keep business secrets and implemented economic openness. Not only did it submit all production and business conditions to the management committee for discussion, but also established an audit team with worker representatives under the management committee to regularly review the accounts, so that the workers fully understood the actual situation of the factory's income and expenditure, and did not propose excessively high demands that the factory's finances could not bear. And it established a foundation of mutual trust between labor and capital, avoiding many unnecessary disputes between labor and capital.
    (E) In order to obtain the cooperation of the workers, Manager Chen showed the hard-working spirit and democratic style of sharing weal and woe with all the employees of the factory. He reduced his salary to 250 jin of millet per month, lived in a dilapidated office in the factory, and ate with the employees, abolishing the past system of dividing all the employees of the factory into four kinds of stoves. He often held meetings and talked with the workers. When the workers were sick, he often went to the dormitory to visit them, instead of putting on the despicable and hateful bureaucratic airs of the factory directors and managers in bureaucratic capital enterprises and most private enterprises who looked down on the workers. It is said that the technician Wang Xiufeng, who is said to be a ceramic technician with knowledge and experience, also has such a democratic style as Manager Chen. We do not advocate such egalitarianism of equal wages and equal eating (the workers of the factory also proposed several times that the manager and technician do not need to eat the same food as the workers, but the manager and engineer firmly insisted on doing so), but this spirit and style are worthy of learning by the managers and factory directors of various private and public enterprises. This is also one of the main reasons that can make all the employees of the factory unite and work hard to do a good job in production.
    These facts prove that the workers of Beiping Dahua Pottery Company have a higher class consciousness and know how to closely combine their own interests with the interests of developing production; the capitalists of the company also have a clearer understanding of the policy of labor-capital benefit and developing production. Some people say that this is reformism, but they do not know that under the New Democratic regime, it is necessary for capitalists to implement such democratic labor-capital relations reforms. If this is "reformism," then this "reformism" is in line with the interests of all the people at the current stage, that is, in line with the interests of the working class. When capitalists endanger the interests of the working class and the entire people because they are greedy for personal gain, we must of course oppose and stop them. But when certain actions of certain capitalists are in fact in line with the interests of the people, we should appropriately promote and encourage them. The situation of Dahua Pottery Company cannot be said to have no shortcomings, such as some production technologies are still very primitive and need to be improved (such as using human power to hammer stones, which can be replaced by a simple stone crusher, which can reduce the heavy work of the workers), such as the egalitarian wage system in which the difference between the highest and lowest wages of workers is very small, such as the treatment of workers' diseases is entirely paid for by the workers themselves (the factory should stipulate rules and regulations to provide considerable subsidies), such as the bathhouse still under planning has not yet been built (the workers do mud work and must take a bath frequently), the workers' cooperative has not yet been opened, the trade union organization has not yet been formally established, and the democratic methods are not yet used enough, etc. However, although there are these shortcomings, if both labor and capital can continue to work together in the current spirit, it is not difficult to gradually overcome these shortcomings. Therefore, I feel that the workers and capitalists of Dahua Pottery Company have written an essentially good article on how to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital with facts, which is worth introducing here.

    关于发展生产劳资两利政策的几点说明
    “发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利。”这是毛主席指示我们的新民主主义的经济政策和劳动政策的总方针。这是从中国工人阶级的远大利益出发，从中国人民的远大利益出发而确定的方针，它也符合于在新民主主义政权下的一切从事于有益国民生计的私人经营的资本家的利益。因此，“发展生产，劳资两利”，应当成为私营企业中劳资双方解决一切问题的出发点。
    “发展生产，劳资两利”这句话我想有两方面的意义。一方面是只有发展生产，才能达到劳资两利；另一方面是只有实行劳资两利政策，才能过到发展生产的目的。最近在与工人座谈会和资本家座谈会及个别交换意见中，发现无论在一部分工人当中，或资本家当中，对于“发展生产劳资两利”上述两方面的意义，都有一些疑问和疑虑，因此觉得有加以解释的必要。
  （一）为什么只有发展生产，才能达到劳资两利？
    一切觉悟的工人都懂得，只有发展生产，才能实现工人阶级的根本利益。但是还有一部分觉悟程度较差的工人对这个问题有一些疑问和疑虑，需要我们代表工人阶级利益的共产党人给以解释。
    第一个疑问：有人说，共产党解放农民的办法很好很简单，就是把地主的财产平均分配给农民，为什么不能把资本家的财产分配给工人，而要实行发展生产才能改善工人生活呢？其实这个道理是很简单明显的。地主的财产主要就是土地，土地是可以分散耕种而且原来就是分散租给农民耕种的。把土地分给农民以后，农民不再受地主的剥削了，一定更加努力生产；所以平分土地结果，是可以提高农业生产的。农民富裕了，需要的东西也就会日益增多起来，几万万农民的需要和购买力都增加了，中国国内市场飞速的扩大，这就必然会促进中国工业的发展，而且这种发展，还会经常赶不上农民需要的增加，那就无论国营企业和私营企业都将有广泛的市场和很大的发展前途。
    资本家的财产主要是工厂，工厂是不能分的，分掉了就无法生产了。譬如把工厂里的机器拆散分给工人，你分一个轮盘，他分一根皮带，整部机器、整个工厂都破坏了，那能继续生产呢？譬如一个店铺，把它的前柜后库都分光了，那能继续营业呢？我们工人店员不就都要失业吗？所以工人如果实行农民的“分产主义”的办法，不仅是没有益处，而且是有大大的害处的，社会就会倒退，生活就会降低。所以工人决不能分资本家的工厂，恰恰相反，要努力保护工厂，提高生产，才会对工人有利。
    一部分工人中存在的第二个疑问是：资本家是靠剥削我们工人的剩余价值来获利的，我们努力提高生产发展生产的结果，资本家剥削我们的愈多，赚的钱也愈多，对资本家是有利益的，为什么会对我们工人有利益呢？这个问题也是不难解答的。首先，我们工人从来生活痛苦的原因，不外下列三点：第一是由于遭受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义统治的压迫剥削；第二是在私营企业中遭受资本家的直接压迫剥削；第三是中国工业不发展，生产的东西太少。现在，国民党所代表的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，在解放区已经根本打倒了，工人已不再受他们的压迫剥削了。现在的政府是工人阶级领导的人民政府了，在人民政府下，工人可以自由组织工会来保护自己的利益，而且人民政府会要颁布各种法令来保护工人利益，反对资本家对工人的压迫，限制资本家对工人的过分剥削，这一点工友们是用不着疑虑的。因此，工人过去生活痛苦的第一个原因是消除了，第二个原因也消除了一半，留下的一半（资本家剥削私营企业中工人所生产的剩余价值）在目前的历史阶段，还不可能消除，这就应当忍耐。我们现在要努力的是消除第三个原因——生产不发展。正是由于中国工业生产不发展，全国人民一切日用必需品都缺少，造成全国人民生活的普遍贫困。过去统治阶级剥削大多数劳动人民的血汗来谋私利，在绝大多数人民极端贫困的当中，他们少数人可以过享乐腐化的生活。工人阶级当了国家主人翁以后，决不能像过去统治阶级一样剥削多数人来自己享福，恰恰相反，要以全力来提高全国人民的生活水准。全国人民的生活逐渐改善了，工人阶级的生活也就可能逐渐改善。要办到这件事，就只有努力展发生产，繁荣经济。工人阶级要有吃苦在先，享乐在后的精神，努力劳动，来做全国人民的表率。因为中国经济落后，新式工业在整个国民经济中占的分量还不到百分之十。为着大大发展生产，单靠国家资本的力量是很不够的，还必须利用一切正当的私人资本的积极性。除原有私人企业外，还要动员一切可能的私人资本，投到生产事业中来，使工业生产能有更快的发展，人民生活必需品的生产才会日益增多起来。这样固然于资本家有利益，同时对于国民生计有更大的利益，也就是对于我们工人阶级有更大的利益。生产大大的向前发展，工人阶级的生活才会随着改善，这就是发展生产对于工人阶级的好处。
    资本家方面对于发展生产能达到劳资两利的问题，在今天也有一些疑问和疑虑。我们代表工人阶级利益，代表全体人民利益，主张“发展生产，劳资两利”的共产党人，也有责任给以解释。
    第一个疑问是有人说：共产党是工人政党，只会保护工人的利益，不会照顾资本家的利益的，工厂里赚的钱，都会拿去改善工人生活，资本家那里会有利可图呢？不错，共产党是工人阶级的政党，但是上面已经说过，为了工人阶级的利益和整个国家的利益，现在最重要的事情，就是发展工业，工业不发展，不仅中国人民的生活水准不能提高，而且中国民族在经济上无法摆脱帝国主义的束缚，中国工人的生活那能改好呢？中国工人阶级其所以能成为全体人民的领导阶级，就是由于它能代表全体人民的利益，它的利益与全体人民的利益是分不开的。如果把私营企业赚的钱，通通拿去改善工人生活，试问那能积累资本，扩大生产，发展工业呢？有高度阶级觉悟的工人，决不会赞成这样做。相反的，一定会主张把企业赚的钱，大部积累起来，作为扩大生产的资本，并以适当的部分作为资本家的利润，使资本家有扩大生产的兴趣。所以在这一点上资本家与工人的利益是可以一致的。
    第二个疑问是，有人说共产党是主张共产的，今天讲劳资两利，不过是骗人的把戏，明天就会把我们工厂企业共掉，对资本家还谈得上什么利益呢？不错，共产党是主张共产主义的，但是要实现共产主义，还需要经过一个很长的时期。前面已说过，中国的特点就是经济发展太落后。中国的工业和农业在国民经济中的比重，就全国范围来说，大约是工业占百分之十左右，农业占百分之九十左右。这种经济状况与俄国十月革命的时候不同，与现在东欧各新民主主义国家也不同。所以中国不仅不能像当时俄国一样，直接进行社会主义革命，而且不能像东欧各新民主主义国家一样，在革命胜利几年后就开始过渡到社会主义。中国革命在取得全国胜利后，还需要经过一个相当长的新民主主义建设时期，来发展中国的工业，使中国经济能完全摆脱帝国主义的束缚，使工业与农业在整个国民经济中的比重逐渐改变，并且使工业的比重达到一个相当高的程度。没有这种改变，没有工业的大大发展，不仅谈不上实行社会主义，并且谈不上中国民族在经济上对帝国主义的真正彻底的独立自主。所以革命胜利以后，全国人民生活中最主要最基本的问题，将是动员全国人民的一切力量，来发展生产，建设新民主主义的社会。这就不仅需要全体劳动人民坚决奋斗，而且需要一切真正的民族资本家民族企业家都来一致努力，才能有比较迅速的成功。中国民族资本家，在过去受着帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义的压迫，始终是在萎缩状态中挣扎着，中国民族企业家始终是在层层的压迫或限制之下转不过气来的。只有到现在，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治打倒以后，进到新民主主义建设时期，一切有益于国计民生的民族资本企业，才会获得真正合理的迅速发展，一切愿为发展民族生产努力的企业家，才能舒展自己与人民有益的才能，与工人合作创造和扩大有益于国民生计的企业，在发展生产，繁荣经济的事业上有所建树。所以用发展生产来达到劳资两利的政策，决不是什么骗人的把戏，而是新民主主义建设时期所必需的，而且是唯一正确的政策。
    由此可见，只有发展生产，才能达到劳资两利的问题，工人方面固然无须怀疑，就是资本家方面，也没有什么可以怀疑或疑虑的了。（⑴⑵）
  （二）为什么只有实行劳资两利政策，才能达到发展生产的目的？
    这个问题，在觉悟的工人方面，因为认识到中国新民主主义革命的历史条件和历史任务，因为认识到今天中国各阶级相互间的关系，也是没有什么疑问的。但是在一部分觉悟程度较差的工人中间，也有些疑问需要给以详细的解释。
    有些工友们这样想：过去我们受资本家的压迫剥削很厉害，简直无法生活，现在解放了，我们应当向资本家斗争，叫资本家多拿出一些钱来，改善我们的生活才合道理，为什么还要照顾他们的利益呢？抱这样想法的工人，首先是不知道今天中国人民解放最主要的敌人是帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义，只有把这三个敌人彻底打倒了，中国人民才能获得真正解放，开始建设自己的新民主主义的新中国。有爱国心的民族资本家也是长期受着这三个敌人压迫的，所以他们在今天有可能和我们工人阶级、和农民阶级、小资产阶级联合起来，反对共同的敌人。革命胜利后，在建设时期，也需要发扬民族资本家们的积极经营的企业心，和我们工人一块来共同发展工业。所以，我们不应当把民族资产阶级当做敌人，而应当把他们当作朋友来团结他。当然，如果他们继续过去那种压迫工人和过分地剥削工人的作法，我们是要反对的，其办法就是采取协商，谈判，订立条约，请政府仲裁，向法庭控告等等方法来获得合理的解决。我们对资本家的斗争还是为了达到更好的团结的。其次，抱这样想法的工人，不知道我们中国工人阶级和全体人民最高的利益，是发展生产，而且我们要鼓励资本家来参加这一发展生产的事业。要资本家热心经营，扩大生产，就必需使资本家有利可图，所以我们工人的经济要求，不能过高；如果过高了，弄到资本家无钱可赚，甚至亏本，结果必然是资本家不愿积极经营，企业垮台，大家失业，这不仅于资本家不利，对于工人也是不利的。我们工人阶级既然成了国家的主人翁，就应当把发展生产，繁荣经济，逐渐提高人民生活水准的重大责任负担起来。所以我们现在对资本家提出要求，不应片面地仅仅从工人一时福利的观点出发，而应当照顾到整个发展生产的正当利益，不应当只想到眼前过好日子，而应当注意谋取长远的幸福。只顾资本家的利益，不顾工人生活的困难，是完全不对的，这样将损害工人的生产积极性，于工人不利，于发展生产繁荣经济不利，这种右倾的观点必须反对，必须克服。但是如果只顾工人暂时的片面的利益，不兼顾资本家方面的利益，也是同样不对的，也是同样对发展生产繁荣经济有害，即是对工人阶级现在和将来的利益都有害。
    对于只有实行劳资两利政策，才能达到发展生产目的的问题，资本家方面当然是不容易了解。资本家们这样想：我们本来生意就不好，赚不了钱，如果再要改善工人生活那能还有钱赚，尤其是要讲民主，工人不服管束了，那能把生产搞好。这种想法，首先是由于不知道过去遭受帝国主义倾销政策和官僚资本家的垄断政策的压迫、排挤、吞并，再加上农民受到地主残酷剥削，购买力很低，民族资本的工厂当然没有市场，生意当然不好。现在这些压迫都去掉了，市场会日益扩大，销路会日益广阔，民族资本的工厂就有了很大发展的前途，就会得到适当的利润。对的，为了整个国民经济发展的利益，国家对于那些于国民经济有害的投机事业是会加以限制的，但这对于那些于国民经济有利的生产事业，只会造成更便利的发展条件。抱这种想法的资本家，特别是由于不知道过去工人在生活异常痛苦和被压迫的状况下工作，生产积极性是一定不高的。现在如果适当的改善工人生活，使工人不会感觉到天天有饥饿冻馁的威胁，适当地改良管理方法，使工人感觉到获得了被尊重的地位，并且对改进生产也有机会发表自己的意见，工人的生产积极性就会大大提高起来，生产的数量就会增多，质量也会改好，营业也就会一天一天好起来，便有可能扩大生产，发展生产了。
    经过这样的解释，我想关于只有实行劳资两利政策才能达到发展生产的目的这个问题，不但在工人方面，而且在资本家方面，都可以没有疑问了。
  （三）怎样实行劳资两利的政策
    前几天我在和北平大华窑业公司经理陈荫棠先生谈话时曾说过：毛主席善于出题目，每个题目都出得切实中肯。可是要照着他出的题目来做一篇好文章，却是很不容易的事。要做好这样的文章，首先要由与题目直接有关的当事人自己来做才行。的确，大华窑业公司的工人和资本家是把这篇文章用事实写出来了，而且写得大致不错。所以我与其凭空来写文章，不如把他们已经作出的事实介绍一下。
    关于北平大华窑业公司，在解放后不到三个月，即能逐渐提高生产，逐渐实现劳资两利的情形，前几日报纸上已有过较详细的报道。应当着重指出，提高生产首先是依靠工人的努力，因为只有劳动者才是生产的主体，才能创造一切生产品。因此，大华窑业公司的生产的提高，首先是大华工人辛勤劳动的功劳。但是大华工人劳动积极性现在为什么能比过去提高呢？这就不能仅仅从大华工人中间去求解释，而要从整个工人阶级和中国人民在中国政治斗争中的胜利去求解释，从中国共产党“发展生产，劳资两利”的经济政策的胜利去求解释。这种胜利，使得大华的现在的经理陈荫棠相当地接受了劳资两利的原则，采取了与工人合作的态度，因而有助于工人积极性的提高。该公司劳资双方实现资劳两利政策的几个主要办法如下：
    （甲）北平刚一解放，二月四日，该公司的陈经理增加了投资，工人也迅速复工，并共同计划扩大生产，现在这种计划，已在一步一步地实现着。在国民党时代平均每个月不过烧两窑货，解放后，三月份烧了五窑，四月份可烧出八窑。
    （乙）劳资双方都能以发展生产为前提，在照顾生产利益的条件下，适当的改善了职工的生活。陈经理看见工人工资太低（除伙食外每天每人只有两斤半到三斤半小米）无法维持生活的状况，为了使工人安心工作，为了使工人生产积极性提高，以便多出生产品，便着手提高工资，改善工人生活。另一方面，工人也认识到目前公司亏本，若工资过高，开支增加，便将无法继续营业，因而自愿把工资定得较低（每天三斤半至五斤半小米，最近已拟调整为四斤一两至七斤半，伙食由厂方供给），知道只要生产发展了，工厂赚钱了，生活是可以逐渐改善的。这种劳资双方都以搞好生产为目标，互相照顾，是实现劳资两利政策的主要前题。
    （丙）改变了旧的管理方法，建立了厂务管理委员会，以经理为主任、吸收工人代表参加，一切生产、管理、人事调动、工资、福利事业，均提到管理委员会作详尽的讨论，使工人代表能充分地发表意见，所以管理委员会决定的一切问题，能得到全体工人的拥护，因而没有发生因工人不满意引起劳资纠纷的事情。同时使工人感觉到在生产中的地位有了改变，已经能够参加生产管理，因而产生了对生产的责任心和积极性。这件事实，完全证明了第六次劳动大会所指出的，只要资本家愿意，在私营企业中也可以组织生产管理委员会的指示，是完全正确的。
    （丁）资方打破了极力保持营业秘密的旧习和成见，实行经济公开，不仅把一切生产营业状况均提到管理委员会讨论，而且在管理委员会下面设立有工人代表参加的审核组，经常审查帐目，使工人完全了解厂里收支盈亏的实况，而不提出为厂里财政所不能担负的过高的要求，并且建立了劳资互相信任的基础，避免了劳资间许多不必要的纠纷。
    （戊）为了取得工人的合作，陈经理表现了与全厂职工同甘共苦的苦干精神与民主作风。他降低自己的薪水为每月二百五十斤小米，住在厂里一间破旧的办公室里，并与职工一块吃饭，废除了过去全厂职工分为四种灶的制度。他经常与工人一块开会、谈话，工人有病他常到寝室去看视，而不象官僚资本企业和大多数私营企业中厂长经理轻视工人摆起那种可鄙又可恨的官僚架子。该厂技师王秀峰，据说是一个有学识经验的陶瓷技师，也和陈经理一样，具有这样的民主作风。我们并不提倡这样工资平等吃饭平等的平均主义（该厂工人也几次提出说，经理和技师不必和工人一块吃一样的饭，可是经理和工程师坚决要这样做），但这种精神和作风，是值得各私营公营企业的经理和厂长学习的。这也是能使得全厂职工团结一致，努力搞好生产的主要原因之一。
    这些事实，证明北平大华窑业公司的工人，有较高的阶级觉悟，知道把自己的切身利益与发展生产的利益，密切结合起来；该公司的资本家对于劳资两利发展生产的政策，也有比较明确的认识。有人说，这是改良主义，而不知道在新民主主义政权下，正是需要资本家实行这样的民主的劳资关系的改革。如果说这是“改良主义”，那么这种“改良主义”是符合于目前阶段全体人民的利益，也就是符合于工人阶级的利益的。当资本家因贪图个人私利危害到工人阶级和全体人民利益的时候，我们当然要加以反对和制止。但当某些资本家的某些行动在事实上符合于人民的利益，我们就应当加以恰如其分的提倡和鼓励。大华窑业公司的情形，也不能说没有缺点，如有些生产技术还很原始，需要改进（如用人力锤石子，可以用简单的碎石机来代替，便可以减轻工人这种笨重工作），如工人最高工资与最低工资相差很小的平均主义工资制度，如工人疾病治疗完全由工人自己出钱（厂方应定出规章，给以相当的补助），如还在计划中的澡堂，尚未建筑好（工人作的是泥土工作必须经常洗澡），工人合作社尚未开办，工会组织尚未正式成立，民主方法还运用得不够等等，但虽有这些缺点，如果劳资双方，都能本着目前这种精神，继续共同努力，是不难逐渐克服这些缺点的。所以我觉得大华窑业公司的工人和资本家是用事实写了一篇基本上不错的如何实现劳资两利政策的文章，值得在这里介绍一番。
