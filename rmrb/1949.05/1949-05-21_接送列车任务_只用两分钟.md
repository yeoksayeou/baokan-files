　　Train Arrival and Departure Tasks
  　Completed in Just Two Minutes
    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Changchun, 19th Dispatch: Changchun Railway Station employees, in a labor emulation drive, completed the train arrival and departure tasks in two minutes, setting a new record. Under Kuomintang rule, this task took a total of thirty to forty-five minutes to complete. Since the People's Government took over Changchun Railway Station, thanks to the increased awareness of the workers and the implementation of a new operating system and incentive measures, the time for train arrival and departure has gradually been shortened until, on the 24th of last month, the train arrival and departure tasks were completed in just two minutes. This astonishing work achievement has been commended by the Changchun Railway Bureau.

　　接送列车任务
  　只用两分钟
    【北平新华广播电台广播】长春十九号消息：长春车站员工在劳动大竞赛中，两分钟完成列车接送任务，创造了新纪录。这一项工作在国民党统治时期一共需要三十到四十五分钟，才能完成。自从人民政府接管长春车站以后，由于工人觉悟提高和实行新行车制与奖励办法，使接送列车时间逐渐缩短到上月二十四号只用两分钟的时间，就完成了列车接送任务。这一个惊人的工作成绩，已经得到长春铁路分局的嘉奖。
