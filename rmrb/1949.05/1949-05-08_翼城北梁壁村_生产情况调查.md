    Investigation of Production in Beiliangbi Village, Yicheng
    Reduced Wartime Tasks, Increased Livestock and Farm Tools: Increased Production Conditions are Available but Await Organized Leadership
    [Taiyue Telegraph] Beiliangbi Village in Yicheng County has a total of 63 households, 307 people, 43 male full and semi-laborers, and 52 female full and semi-laborers, with 1,430 mu of land. In the past, each male full and semi-laborer in the village cultivated an average of more than 33 mu of land (calculated based on each person working in the fields for eight months a year, with each mu of land requiring seven to nine workdays; one laborer could cultivate an average of 30 mu of land). Because each person also served an average of 30 days of wartime service, each mu of land only received an average of slightly more than six workdays. This year, wartime service has been greatly reduced. If the 52 female full and semi-laborers can be mobilized, each mu of land could increase by almost two workdays. In terms of livestock power, before October of last year, the entire village had 13 animals, with each animal cultivating an average of 79 mu of land. From October of last year to now, the number of livestock has increased to 35, which can provide twice as much animal labor as last year. Since last autumn, the tasks related to war participation have been greatly reduced. In addition, the high morale of the masses after the Party rectification and the conclusion of land reform, when planting wheat, more than two-thirds of the land was plowed and harrowed four times each. This spring, it was universally hoed once. The autumn land was universally turned over last year. Through the call to repair and add farm tools during winter production, coupled with the agricultural tool loans this spring, farm tools can be replenished to 49.4% of the total shortage, and the number of iron hoes alone can increase by 30. Under such circumstances, it is possible to hoe the autumn land one more time, plow the wheat land one more time, and universally turn over the cotton fields. As the saying goes, "Autumn land is always on the hoe, wheat land is always on the plow handle," and "Turning the land once adds three years," as long as these can be achieved, production will definitely increase. In addition, the increase in livestock is a great advantage for accumulating manure. The village's 35 animals produce at least 15 loads of manure every day. By the end of the twelfth lunar month last year, 2,100 loads had already been accumulated. Based on one latrine per household and three loads per month, the annual amount would be 2,268 loads, and 756 loads have already been accumulated. In addition, the entire village produced 16,000 jin of cottonseed last winter, and after half of it is exchanged for oil, the remaining amount can be exchanged for 16,000 jin of oilcake. Based on the above materials, the high production morale of the masses, the reduction of wartime tasks, and the increase in livestock and farm tools, the conditions for "intensive cultivation and meticulous farming" this year are quite favorable. As long as we can correctly organize mutual aid in leadership, promptly solve certain specific difficulties in cultivation, and prepare to fight against all temporary possible disasters, the task of "increasing production by 10%" can be accomplished.

    翼城北梁壁村
    生产情况调查
    战勤任务减少牲口农具增加增产条件具备有待组织领导
    【太岳电】翼城北梁壁村全村，共六十三户、三百零七口人，四十三个男全半劳力，五十二个女全半劳力，一千四百三十亩土地，过去村中男全半劳动力，每人平均种三十三亩多地（按每人全年在地里劳动八个月，每亩地要用七个到九个工计，一个劳力平均可种三十亩地）。因为每人平均还服了三十天的勤，每亩地只平均到六个工多一些。今年服勤大大减少，如果能再发动五十二个女全半劳动力，每一亩地就差不多能够增加两个工。在畜力上，去年十月以前，全村是十三头牲口，每头平均种七十九亩土地。从去年十月到现在，增加到三十五头牲口，可以比去年多下一倍的畜工。去年秋天以后参战任务大大减少，加上整党和结束土改以后群众生产情绪高涨，种麦的时候，三分之二以上的地作到了犁、耙各四遍。今年春天又普遍锄了一遍。秋地去年普遍都刹过了。经过冬季生产中号召修理和添置农具，加上今年春天的农具贷粮，农具可以增补到全部缺少数的百分之四十九点四，光铁铣就能增加三十张。在这样的情况下，今年的秋地多锄一遍，麦地多犁一遍，棉花地普遍翻一遍，是可以作到的。俗话说：“秋地常在锄头上，麦地常在犁拐上”，“地翻一遍长三年”，只要能作到这些，一定可以增加产量的。另外牲口的增加，对于积肥是个很大的有利条件。全村三十五头牲口，每天最少积十五担粪，去年阴历腊月底，已积了二千一百担。按每户一个茅坑，每月三担，一年就是二千二百六十八担，现在已经积了七百五十六担。另外全村去冬产棉籽一万六千斤，除了一半换油外，剩下的还能换一万六千斤油饼。根据以上材料，群众生产情绪的高涨，战勤任务的减少，牲口、农具的增加，今年“精耕细作”的条件相当具备，只要我们在领导上能够正确地组织互助、及时地解决耕作中的某些具体困难，准备向一切临时可能发生的灾害作斗争，“增产一成”的任务，是可以完成的。
