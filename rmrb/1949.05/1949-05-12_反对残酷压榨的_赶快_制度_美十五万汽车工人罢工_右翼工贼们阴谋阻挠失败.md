Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th: TASS reports: Nearly 150,000 auto workers in the United States are currently on strike in opposition to the speed-up system. Approximately 65,000 workers at the Ford Motor Company's Detroit plant began striking on the 5th, protesting the company's intensification of the cruel exploitation of workers through the speed-up system. Workers have been fighting against the speed-up system for the past ten months. During this period, 8,000 workers have been laid off, yet production has not decreased. Recently, in order to compete with other automobile companies, the factory has further increased the speed of all major conveyors to the point where workers are unable to keep up with assembly work. This measure, which increases the burden on workers, has aroused their resentment. The workers had requested the leaders of the United Auto Workers union to approve a strike, but the reactionary leader, Reuther, a scab, refused to grant it. In order to alleviate workers' dissatisfaction with the highly intensified speed-up system in the assembly shops, the right-wing union leadership established a committee to conduct an investigation. But the fact is that when the committee went to the factory to investigate and determine whether a strike was "justified," the company slightly reduced the speed of the conveyors. As a result, the committee hastily announced that there was no reason for a strike. Immediately after the investigation committee left, the company increased the speed of the conveyors by another 10 percent. As a result, the workers, disregarding the obstruction of the union's reactionary leaders, decided to strike. This strike will shut down Ford's other 47 plants with 45,000 workers, as well as 3,500 small companies that supply Ford with parts and raw materials. In addition, 7,500 workers at the Bendix Aviation Corporation in South Bend, Indiana, began striking on April 20, opposing the speed-up system and the unjustified dismissal of 47 workers. At the same time, workers at the Briggs Manufacturing plant in Detroit, which manufactures automobile bodies, also launched a similar strike.

    反对残酷压榨的“赶快”制度
    美十五万汽车工人罢工
    右翼工贼们阴谋阻挠失败
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社讯：美国现在有近十五万汽车工人正在因为反对赶快制度而进行罢工。福特汽车公司底特律工厂约六万五千工人，因抗议公司方面对工人实行残酷压榨的赶快制度变本加厉，已于五日开始罢工。在过去十个月里，工人一直进行着反对赶快制度的斗争。在此期间，工人被解雇者已达八千人，而生产并未减少。最近，厂方为与其他汽车公司竞争，更提高一切主要传送机的速度，达到使工人无法赶上装配工作的程度。这种加重工人负担的措施，激起了工人们的愤恨。工人曾经要求联合汽车工人工会的首领批准罢工，但以工贼路特为首的反动领导，竟不予批准。为缓和工人对装配间施用高度赶快制度的不满起见，右翼工会领导机关建立一个委员会，进行调查。但是事实是，在该委员会前赴工厂调查以决定工人罢工是否“合理”的时候，公司方面稍微减少了传送机的速度。这样一来，委员会就赶快宣布罢工是没有理由的。调查委员会一走，公司方面紧接着又将传送机的速度增加百分之十。结果，工人不顾工会反动首领的阻挠，决定罢工。这个罢工，将使福特公司其他四十七个厂的四万五千工人以及供给福特公司零件与原料的三千五百个小公司停工。此外，印第安那州南本德的潘迪克航空公司的七千五百工人，也因反对赶快制度及无理解雇四十七名工人，于四月二十日开始罢工。同时，在底特律制造汽车车身的布里吉斯制造厂工人，也发动了类似的罢工。
