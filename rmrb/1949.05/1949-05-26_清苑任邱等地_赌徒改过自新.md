(Jizhong Electric) In Qingxian, Qingyuan, Renqiu and other counties, gambling occurred in some villages. After the local government gave them criticism, education and labor punishment respectively, some gamblers have reformed. In Chenquetun, the twelfth district of Qingxian County, there were more than 40 gambling sessions, and 25 households openly participated in gambling. In Yangzhuang Village, Qingyuan, some gamblers mortgaged their land certificates while gambling; some sold agricultural tools because they lost all their money, and even theft occurred. Renqiu Bianguan Village gamblers Tian Baoyu and others colluded with local ruffian Gui Xiwu and his gang to commit robbery when they could not maintain their livelihoods due to gambling. The case has now been solved and they have been detained in the county. The local county and district governments, in order to strictly prohibit those gamblers who disrupted social order, patrolled the villages to arrest them. In the second half of April, Qingxian County investigated and dealt with 14 cases of gambling, arrested 56 gamblers, and seized four sets of gambling paraphernalia. After the 56 gamblers arrested in Chenquetun, Qingxian County, were criticized and educated by district and village cadres, most of them swore on the spot: "If we violate the rules again, we are willing to accept three days of labor punishment." And within three days, they voluntarily handed over 80 sets of gambling equipment. Gambler Li Shupo also began to participate in field production and planted cotton. In order to strictly prohibit gambling, the Qingyuan Public Security Bureau organized a gambling arrest work team. On the one hand, it carried out publicity, and on the other hand, it implemented a registration method with the government to promote reform. In mid-April, in 31 villages, 45 gamblers registered with the county government and handed over 178 sets of various gambling paraphernalia. Among them, gamblers Zhang Chenghai, Wang Yuanchun and other 24 people, in order to show their repentance, proposed to participate in field production and plant 106 mu of cotton and peanuts.
