　　【Chahar News】Political disintegration combined with armed suppression has basically eliminated the large groups of bandits in northern Chahar. Significant results have also been achieved in eliminating routed soldiers and scattered bandits in Yishui, western Pingxi, and other places. According to incomplete statistics from three months, our militia killed, wounded, and captured 929 bandits, seizing 180 rifles, 24 machine guns, and 61 horses. Small groups of bandits of three to five people still remain, but after "hiding their guns" (what the old people of northern Chahar call hiding guns), many cadres have a blurred understanding. They think that after "hiding the guns," the problem will be easily solved. The leadership has reminded various places to pay attention to this kind of paralysis. The following experiences have been gained in the three months of suppression work: (1) It is necessary to establish a joint defense bandit suppression organization and strengthen the system of meetings, reports, and exchange of intelligence. Especially in the combined areas, it is necessary to achieve unified command, concentrated strength, and unified steps. Militias should be regularly educated to eliminate harm for the people and overcome departmentalism and task-oriented viewpoints. Close command and liaison of joint defense operations are needed to accurately grasp the bandit situation and prevent the drawbacks of each acting on its own, not coordinating with each other, and allowing the bandits to take the opportunity to escape. (2) Military strikes must be closely combined with political disintegration. First of all, the leadership's thinking should clearly focus on mobilizing the masses to carry out political disintegration, while closely cooperating with armed suppression. (3) Accurately grasp the enemy's situation and carry out key suppression. The leadership must plan and deploy well, and stipulate battlefield discipline, action passwords, and communication signals in advance. Otherwise, temporary panic and confusion can easily cause bandits to escape. In Shangdu, Huade, Kangbao, Zhaiyuan and other counties in northern Chahar, because the situation was not grasped in time and communication was not clear, bandits often took advantage of this weakness to harass various places. (4) Mobilize the masses to automatically suppress bandits or report to us. For example, Yanggaofeng, Renshan, Laozaishan, and other places often harbor bandits, but because the village cadres and militias nearby constantly and automatically encircled and suppressed them, the bandits could not gain a foothold and had to retreat to Datong (Datong was not yet liberated at that time).

  　政治瓦解结合清剿
  　察北土匪大部消灭
    【察哈尔讯】政治瓦解结合武装清剿察北大股土匪现已基本剿灭。易水、平西等地在剿灭溃兵、散匪亦获很大成绩。据三个月不完全统计，我民兵共毙伤俘土匪九二九名，激获步枪一八○支，机枪二四挺，马六一匹。现三五成群的小股土匪仍然残存，但“插枪”（把枪藏起来，察北老百姓叫插枪）潜伏后，不少干部认识模糊。以为“插枪”后，问题便好解决了，此种麻痹思想，领导上已提醒各地注意。在三个月的清剿工作中，已获得以下几点经验：（一）必须树立联防剿匪组织，并加强会议、汇报、交换情报等制度。特别是结合部地带，尤须作到统一指挥，力量集中，步调统一。对民兵经常进行为民除害的教育，克服本位主义和任务观点。密切联防作战的指挥联系，确切掌握匪情，防止各自为政，互不策应，致使土匪趁机逃窜的弊端发生。（二）军事打击与政治瓦解密切结合，首先领导思想上应明确着重发动群众进行政治瓦解，同时密切配合武装清剿。（三）确切掌握敌情进行有重点的扑灭，领导上要很好计划布置，事先统一规定战场纪律，行动口令与联络讯号等。否则，临时张慌失措，易使土匪漏网。察北商都、化德、康保、宅源等县因情况掌握不及时，上下不通气，致使土匪常利用这一弱点，窜扰各地。（四）发动群众自动剿匪，或向我报告，如阳高峰任山、老寨山等地经常窝藏土匪，但由于附近村干部民兵不断自动围剿，使匪不能站脚，不得已而退缩到大同（按大同当时尚未解放）城内。（察哈尔军区武装部）
