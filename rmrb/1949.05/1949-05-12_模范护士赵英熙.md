    Model Nurse Zhao Yingxi
    Xia Kui
    Zhao Yingxi was the only female comrade among the 110 heroes and model workers at the First Congress of Heroes and Model Workers of the Jilin Military Region. When she gave her typical report, she attracted the attention of the entire audience. Her vivid deeds aroused continuous applause. Some even craned their necks and shouted, "This is our glory!" She is the nursing squad leader of the health team of the ×× department regiment, 22 years old this year. She lived with her father, a pharmacist, in Yanbian since she was a child. After graduating from elementary school, she attended nursing school for two more years. After "August 15th" (the Soviet Red Army marched into the Northeast), she was working as a nurse in the ×× Army Hospital. At that time, she heard comrades in the hospital say, "Today's troops are different from the past, they are working for themselves." So she joined the army and became the nursing squad leader in the health team.

    The year before last, near the Lunar New Year, Zhao Yingxi followed the troops to Sandaowan to suppress bandits. The regimental headquarters ordered the health clinic to be set up in a small village and forbade them from going to the front line. But Zhao Yingxi and the deputy squad leader Cui Hechen went to the regimental commander before dawn and said, "Regimental Commander Park, we want to go to the front line too!" The regimental commander did not allow them to go, but because they insisted on going, he had to allow it.

    At dawn, the troops were deploying when the health team leader Cui's pistol went off accidentally, and the battle to suppress bandits started early. Comrade Zhao Yingxi bravely crawled to the front line to carry the wounded. After carrying them down, she immediately changed their dressings. Because it was cold, it was not easy to undress them, so she cut open the wounded's cotton clothes to change their dressings. After the dressings were changed, she mobilized the lightly wounded to walk off the front line, and she carried the seriously wounded one by one to the health clinic. The health clinic was two li away from the front line. One day, she carried a total of seventeen seriously wounded. Although she was exhausted, she persevered. After the battle of Sandaowan, she followed the troops to Miaoling to fight against the bandit Hu. They spent the night on the mountain. Before they could scout the situation, the bandits attacked. Because they were caught off guard, the troops suffered losses. At that time, Zhao Yingxi saw the enemy rushing up from all sides, so she carried the large medicine kit and rolled down the mountain. Under the rain of bullets, she finally rolled safely down the mountain. At this time, she met a soldier who said to her, "At this time, what are you doing carrying the medicine kit? Why don't you throw it away?" She said, "You ask me to throw away the medicine kit, why don't you throw away your gun? Guns and medicine are equally important, how can you throw them away?" The soldier was convinced.

    In April, she participated in the battle of Changchun. At that time, their health team was stationed in a small village thirty-five li southeast of Changchun. She thought that she must participate in this great battle. When the battle started, she went to the front line to rescue the wounded. On the first day, she carried a total of five or six seriously wounded, and at the same time, she carried the soldiers' guns. On the second day, the ×× regiment fought near a large bridge. The troops were west of the bridge, and the health clinic was east of the bridge. The enemy was blocking the bridge with heavy weapons. Some wounded could not be rescued. She braved the enemy's artillery fire and ran over, finding Regimental Commander Park seriously wounded. After first aid, she carried Regimental Commander Park down. Others took turns carrying him, but she carried him alone for thirty-five li. On the third day, they attacked a park. A company of the ×× regiment charged the enemy, and some soldiers were injured. She carried a total of more than ten seriously wounded. Because she was too tired and could not eat or sleep well, she was even about to faint, but she insisted on working until the victory of the battle.

    After entering Changchun, she followed the troops to Jiutai. At this time, there was an infectious disease in the troops. The patients had a high fever and then developed mental illness, sometimes sitting up and shouting "Charge!", and sometimes grabbing bayonets and shouting "Kill!". For more than a month, she did not sleep well, nervously caring for the sick and wounded.

    In early winter, she had just recovered from her illness. There was no coal to burn in the wounded's room. She took the lead in picking coal for the wounded to burn. Her hands were bleeding from digging, but she did not stop. In one winter, she picked four sacks of coal and kept the stove warm. The sick and wounded gratefully said, "Even our relatives would not be so caring!"

    A comrade in the fourth battalion was injured by artillery fire. She cared for him all night. The next day, she personally sent a seriously wounded soldier to the hospital for surgery. Because of anemia, she fainted. She immediately requested to test her blood type and transfused 50 CC of blood, saving the wounded's life from danger.

    The next day, she took a car back to Laotoupangou. Because she had not slept for two nights and had lost too much blood, she was thrown out of the car when it turned, and her right foot was seriously injured. She went to recuperate. During this period, she was always thinking about the troops. When she heard that they were going to perform combat missions, she became even more anxious. As soon as she could walk, she left the hospital and, disregarding her mother's advice, went to the front line again.

    Her chest burns with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. In her opinion, comrades are her relatives, and the revolutionary troops are her family. She is willing to sacrifice herself for the lives of her comrades, and no matter how much she suffers, she cares for the health of her comrades. Therefore, she became a special-class model worker. She made a special-class great contribution and became a model banner for nurses in the Jilin troops.

    模范护士赵英熙
    夏葵
    赵英熙是吉林军区的第一届群英大会上一一○名英雄模范中唯一的女同志。当她作典型报告时，引起了全场的注意，生动的事迹，激起不断的掌声。有的竟引颈高呼：“这是我们的光荣！”她是××部团卫生队的护士班长，现年二十二岁，从小就跟作药剂师的父亲住在延边。小学毕业后，又住了两年看护学校，“八一五”（苏联红军进军东北）以后，她正在××陆军医院当护士，当时她听住院的同志说：“如今的部队与从前不同，而是为自己干的。”于是她就参加了部队，在卫生队当护士班长。
    前年，快过旧历年的时候，赵英熙就随着部队到三道湾去剿匪，团部命令把卫生所设在一个小屯子里，不叫他们上火线去，但是赵英熙和副班长崔和辰天不亮就找团长说：“朴团长，我们也要上火线去！”团长不允许他们去，但因他们坚决要求去，只好允许了。
    天微明，部队正在布署，因卫生队崔队长的手枪走火，剿匪的战斗就提早打起来，赵英熙同志勇敢的爬到火线上去背伤号，背下后马上换药，因为天冷，不易解开衣服，她就把伤号的棉衣剪开来换药，换好后，轻伤的动员他们走下火线，重伤的她一个个背到卫生所去。卫生所离火线有二里地。有一天，她总共背了十七个重伤号。她虽累的不行了，还支持着。打完三道湾以后，又随部队到庙岭去打胡匪，在山上住一宿，未等侦察情况，胡匪就来袭击，因猝不及防，部队吃了亏。当时赵英熙看见敌人从四面冲上来，她就背着大药包往山下滚，在枪林弹雨下，终于安全的滚到山下，这时碰见一个战士，对她说：“到这时，你还带着药包干什么？还不扔掉？”她说：“你叫我把药包扔掉，你怎么不把你的枪扔掉呢？枪和药一样重要，怎么能扔掉呢？”把战士说得心悦诚服。
    四月，参加长春战斗。当时他们的卫生队扎在长春东南卅五里的一个小屯子里。她想这一次伟大战斗，一定去参加。战斗开始，她就到火线上去救护伤号，头一天一共背下五六个重伤号，同时连伤员的枪都背下来。第二天，××团打到一个大桥附近，部队在桥西，卫生所在桥东，敌人用重火器封锁着大桥，有伤号救不下来，她冒着敌人的炮火跑了过去，发现朴团长负了重伤，经过急救，把朴团长抬下来，别人都换着抬，她一个人不换一直抬了三十五里地。第三天攻打一个公园，××团一个连向敌人冲锋，有些战士受伤了，她总共背下十多个重伤员，由于太累了，又不能好好吃饭和睡觉，甚至要昏倒，她还坚持工作到战斗胜利结束。
    打进长春以后，随部队开到九台，这时部队里发生了传染病，病人一发高烧，就发神经病，一会坐起喊“冲啊！”一会又抓起刺刀喊“杀呀！”一个多月，她没有好好睡觉，提心吊胆地看护伤病员。
    初冬，她病刚好，伤员房里没有煤烧，她领头拣煤给伤员烧，手都挖出了血，也不停止，一冬她拣了四麻袋的煤，把炕烧的暖暖的。伤病号都感激地说：“我们亲人也不过是这样爱护我们吧！”
    四营有个同志被炮弹炸伤，她看护一夜，次日，亲自送一个重伤员到医院动手术，因贫血昏厥，她立刻要求检验自己的血型，输了五十ＣＣ的血，挽救了伤员的危险。
    第二天，她坐汽车回老头旁沟，因两夜未睡，输血过多，在汽车转湾时，被摔下来，右脚受重伤，去休养。在这期间，她老惦着部队，听到去执行战斗任务，就更加着急，刚能走，就出院，不顾母亲的劝告，就又到前方去了。
    她的胸中燃烧着高度的革命热情，在她看来，战友就是她的亲人，革命部队就是她的家庭，为了战友的生命，不惜牺牲自己，为了战友们的健康，不管自己怎样受苦。因此她成为特等模范工作者，她立了特等大功，成为吉林部队护士工作者的一面模范的旗帜。
