Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd. Under the strenuous mediation of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Tianjin Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, most of the labor-capital disputes that have occurred in Tianjin's private industrial and commercial sectors in the past three months have been resolved one after another. According to incomplete statistics from ten districts in the city, a total of 441 cases have been mediated. This has greatly promoted the rapid opening and resumption of private industrial and commercial businesses and the development of production. As of mid-April, more than 80 percent of private factories in the city had resumed work, and more than 90 percent of stores had resumed business. The production situation in the factories is very good; some factories are actively preparing to expand their business.

The reasons for labor-capital disputes are mostly due to capitalists delaying the start of work and resumption of business, delaying the payment of wages, and neglecting to guarantee workers a certain standard of living and improve their working conditions. Certain "leftist" sentiments that occurred among some workers also had an impact on labor-capital disputes.

Initially, when Tianjin was just liberated, most capitalists, deceived by the Kuomintang's long-term propaganda, lacked understanding of the People's Government's industrial and commercial policies and harbored many doubts. They not only postponed the start of work and resumption of business but also delayed the payment of wages, citing "no cash" and other excuses. At that time, it was near the old Lunar New Year. To maintain their livelihood, workers demanded that the capitalists pay wages on time according to material standards and issue year-end bonuses as usual. After the dispute occurred, the People's Government and the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions immediately mediated, advocating that workers' lives must be guaranteed, but to take care of the actual difficulties of the capitalists, workers' demands could be appropriately reduced. At the same time, the government purchased some finished products from factories such as Beiyang Yarn Factory and Zhongtian Electric Factory to help solve the cash difficulties of some capitalists. After such mediation, the dispute was resolved. Most workers received wages and bonuses, or borrowed some New Year's expenses. However, not many factories resumed work. Capitalists still adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Especially capitalists who had colluded with puppet police and secret agents to oppress workers before liberation, such as the Zhiboming Dyeing Factory and the Yida Rice and Flour Shop, were afraid of being liquidated and struggled against by their employees because they had treated workers very harshly in the past. They were reluctant to resume work and business for a long time. Some cited damage to machinery and factory buildings, while others cited a lack of raw materials as reasons for not being able to resume work. Some who had already resumed work and business also individually cited poor business, reduced the scope of business, laid off employees, or actively gave workers things, attempting to disband and stop work. Under this circumstance, workers and shop assistants generally felt the threat of unemployment and demanded that the capitalists start work and resume business quickly. For example, workers at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory wrote to Mayor Huang, asking the government to help solve the problem. The People's Government and the trade union fully supported the workers' demands for resumption of work and business, sending cadres to conduct on-site investigations to understand the capitalists' situation, and then convened labor and capital for mediation. During the mediation process, the workers exposed the concealment and deception of some capitalists and prevented the individual capitalists from stealing and selling equipment and raw materials. For example, the workers of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory exposed that the capitalists' reasons for delaying the resumption of work were all excuses. The capitalists said that the house was hit by shells and the machinery could not be used. In fact, the house was not damaged, and the machinery was deliberately dismantled by the capitalists. Employees of the Chengji Printing Factory prevented the capitalists from selling a large amount of raw materials. Based on the investigation results, the government and the trade union repeatedly explained the People's Government's industrial and commercial policies to the capitalists, urging them to resume work and business with peace of mind. For some industrial and commercial households who had real difficulties in opening, the government and the trade union helped them solve the difficulties of raw materials, funds, and finished product sales, or persuaded the workers to make necessary considerations and concessions. For example, the government, considering that the Qingfaxiang Restaurant employed nine partners and the business was indeed poor, took the initiative to persuade several partners to change their careers. In addition, the government carried out persuasion to workers, aiming at the "equal division" fantasy and excessive demands that occurred among some workers. After the government carried out the above mediation work, Qihua Chemical Plant, Zhiboming Dyeing Factory, Yida Rice and Flour Shop, etc. quickly resumed business and started work. Subsequently, most shops and factories also resumed business and started work one after another.

After resuming work and business, in March, wage disputes followed. Capitalists such as those of the Hengxingtai Iron Factory and the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory neglected to improve workers' lives, attempting to maintain the original excessive working hours and low wage standards. Capitalists such as those of Dasheng Yarn Factory ignored workers' demands for guaranteeing a minimum standard of living and improving working conditions. Although on the other hand, some workers also made some excessive demands, most of the workers' demands were reasonable. Some workers' production enthusiasm was greatly reduced because their reasonable demands were not resolved. At this time, the government and the trade union conducted mediation based on the principles of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." On the one hand, it made the capitalists understand that only reasonable adjustments to wages, so that employees' lives can be guaranteed to a certain extent, can production develop and be profitable, and persuaded the capitalists to resolve the workers' legitimate demands as soon as possible. On the other hand, it educated workers to strive to develop production, consider the interests of the entire working class and all the people, cherish the factory, improve technology, save raw materials, and gradually improve their lives from the development of production. At present, they should not make excessive demands. Under such mediation, the opinions of labor and capital gradually approached and finally reached an agreement. For example, the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory, Tianhexiang Iron Factory, etc. appropriately adjusted wages or shortened working hours to ten hours. Workers also automatically proposed labor discipline to ensure active production. The New Tianjin Rubber Factory, Hengxingtai Iron Factory, Huazhong Printing Factory, etc. have all increased production due to the initial improvement of workers' treatment and the improvement of workers' production enthusiasm. The output of outer tires of the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory has rapidly increased by 30%, and the number of waste tires has been reduced from 20 pairs per day to three or four pairs.

Now most of the labor-capital disputes in Tianjin have been initially resolved. There are several important experiences in the mediation work: (1) An extremely cautious attitude must be adopted in handling labor-capital disputes. Because the broad masses of employees in private industrial and commercial enterprises will judge whether the People's Government and the trade union can guarantee and represent their interests based on the mediation results; the capitalists will also test from this how the People's Government's policy of protecting industrial and commercial enterprises is implemented and to what extent it can be implemented in order to decide future actions. Therefore, it is necessary to handle it prudently and prevent the occurrence of acute diseases. (2) In the process of mediation, it is necessary to educate employees, rely on employees, and organize them, because the employees are familiar with the business conditions of factories and stores. Relying on them can prevent capitalists from destroying and selling equipment and exposing capitalists' concealment and deception, and actively urge the resumption of work; on the other hand, they can also persuade employees to make necessary concessions when capitalists have real difficulties. (3) Mediation work is very complicated, and cadres responsible for mediation must be good at mastering policies. For capitalists, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the People's Government's policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," dispel capitalists' concerns, and persuade capitalists to resume work and business as soon as possible and meet workers' reasonable demands. At the same time, when specifically handling the resumption of work and increasing wage demands, it is also necessary to make the capitalists profitable and help solve their actual difficulties in order to facilitate the development of production. For workers, the cadres responsible for mediation work should be good at guiding the workers to understand and master the policies. It is wrong to unilaterally support workers' excessive demands and adopt a "better left than right" attitude; it is also wrong to ignore workers' reasonable demands or fail to properly resolve them.

    津人民政府与工会努力调解
    劳资纠纷大部获解决
    有力地推动了私营工商业开工复业发展生产
    【新华社天津二日电】在人民政府与华北总工会天津办事处的努力调解之下，近三个月以来，津市私营工商业中所发生的劳资纠纷，已大部陆续获得解决，据全市十个区不完全统计，共调解了四百四十一件。这对私营工商业迅速开工复业，发展生产，起了很大的推动作用。迄上月中旬统计，全市私营工厂复工者已超过百分之八十，商店复业者超过百分之九十，工厂的生产情形，均甚良好；有些厂更在积极准备扩大营业。
    引起劳资纠纷的原因，大部分是由于资本家拖延开工复业，拖延发放工资，以及忽视保障工人一定的生活水平和改善工人的劳动条件，而部分工人中曾发生的某些过左情绪，对劳资纠纷也有影响。
    起初，在津市刚获解放时，一般资本家，由于受了国民党的长期欺骗宣传，对人民政府的工商业政策缺乏了解，怀有许多疑虑，不仅推延开工复业，且借口“没有现款”等拖延发放工资，当时正值旧历年关，工人为维持生活，要求资方按照实物标准按时发给工资，并照旧例发放年赏花红。争议发生后，人民政府与华北总工会筹委会天津办事处即进行调解，主张工人的生活必须保障，但为照顾资方实际困难，工人的要求可酌量减低；同时政府并收买北洋纱厂、中天电机厂等厂的一部分成品，帮助解决了某些资方的现金困难。经这样调解后，争议获了解决。大部工人得到工资与花红，或借到一部过年费。但是，复工的工厂仍不多。资本家仍采观望态度。尤其在解放前，曾经勾结伪警宪、特务压迫过工人的资本家，大博明染厂、义大米面庄等资方，均因过去对待工人非常苛刻，害怕员工起来清算斗争，迟迟不肯复工开业。有的借口机器厂房损毁，有的借口原料缺乏等不能复工，已经复工开业的，也有个别的借口营业不振，缩小营业范围，解雇员工，或主动给工人东西，企图散伙停工，在这种情形下，工人、店员普遍感到失业的威胁，乃向资方提出迅速开工复业的要求。如大中华橡胶厂工人即曾写信给黄市长，要求政府帮助解决，人民政府和工会方面当即对工人们所提复工开业要求，予以全力支持，派出干部进行实地调查，了解资方情况；并进而召集劳资双方进行调解。调解过程中，工人们曾揭露了某些资本家的隐瞒和欺骗，并阻止了个别资方盗卖器材和原料的活动，如大中华橡胶厂工人揭露资方拖延复工的理由全系借口，资方说房子中了炮弹，机器不能使用，其实，房子并没有损坏，机器是资方故意拆散的。成记印刷厂的职工则阻止了资方变卖大宗原料。政府与工会方面根据调查结果，向资本家反复解说人民政府的工商业政策，促其安心复工复业。对于开业确有困难的某些工商户，政府与工会方面或则帮助其解决原料、资金和成品推销的困难，或则劝说工人作必要的照顾和让步。如政府鉴于庆发祥饭馆雇有伙友九人，生意确实清淡，就主动规劝几个伙友转了业。此外，政府针对部分工人中发生的“平分”幻想和过高要求，向工人进行了说服。经过政府进行上述调解工作以后，启华化学厂、博明染厂、义大米面庄等均迅速复业开工。接着，绝大部分商店、工厂也都纷纷复业开工。
    在复工复业之后，三月间，接着又发生了工资问题的纠纷。某些资本家如亨兴泰铁工厂、震中橡胶厂等厂的资方忽视改善工人生活，企图保持原来的过长的工作时间及过低的工资标准，达生纱厂等资方对工人要求保障最低生活水平、改善劳动条件，竟置之不理。虽然另一方面，有些工人也提出了某些过高要求，但是大部分工人的要求是合理的。有些工人因为合理要求未得解决，生产情绪大为低落。此时政府和工会方面乃根据“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的原则，进行调解。一面使资方了解只有合理的调整工资，使员工生活得到一定的保障，生产才能发展，才有利可图，劝导资本家尽速解决工人的正当要求。另一方面则教育工人应努力发展生产，从整个工人阶级及全体人民利益着想，爱护工厂，提高技术，节省原料，从发展生产中逐步改善自己的生活。在目前不应提出过高的要求。劳资双方在这样的调解下，意见逐渐接近，并终于达成协议。如震中橡胶厂、天和祥铁工厂等、都适当地调整了工资，或把工时缩短为十小时。工人也自动提出劳动纪律，保证积极生产。新天津橡胶厂、亨兴泰铁工厂、华中印刷厂等都因初步改善了工人待遇，工人生产情绪提高，增加了产量。震中橡胶厂外胎产量已迅速提高了百分之三十，废胎由每日二十对，减至三、四对。
    现在津市大部劳资纠纷已获得初步解决。在调解工作中有如下几点重要经验：（一）对劳资纠纷的处理，必须采取极其慎重的态度。因为私营工商业的广大职工群众，将根据调解结果，判断人民政府和工会方面是否能保障和代表他们的利益；资本家也从中试探人民政府保护工商业的政策，究竟如何执行，能执行到什么程度，以便决定今后行动。因此，要稳重处理，防止发生急性病现象。（二）在调解过程中必须教育职工，依靠职工，并把他们组织起来，因为职工们熟悉工厂、商店的业务情况，依靠他们才能防止资方破坏盗卖器材及揭露资方的隐瞒和欺骗，积极地督促复工；另一方面也才能在资方确有困难时，说服职工作必要的让步。（三）调解工作是很复杂的，负责调解的干部必须善于掌握政策。对于资本家，要反复说明人民政府“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针。解除资方顾虑，劝导资方尽速开工复业，满足工人的合理要求。同时在具体处理复工和增加工资要求时，又要使资方有利可图，并帮助解决其实际困难，以利发展生产。对于工人，负责调解工作的干部要善于诱导工人群众了解和掌握政策。片面支持工人的过高要求，采取“宁左勿右”的态度是错误的；对工人的合理要求置之不理，或不予适当解决，也是错误的。
