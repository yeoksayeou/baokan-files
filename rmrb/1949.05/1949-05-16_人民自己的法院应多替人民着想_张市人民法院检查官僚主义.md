　　The People's Own Court Should Think More of the People
  　Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Court Examines Bureaucracy
    [Zhangjiakou News] The Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Court has reviewed its trial work over the past three months and determined future improvement directions. In the past, bureaucracy existed in trial work, mainly manifested in: (1) Summonses were often issued on a temporary basis, requiring immediate appearance upon receipt, which was tantamount to detention. This was primarily for the court's own convenience, without considering the parties involved. It has been decided that in the future, summonses should be issued at least one day in advance, and for general civil cases, summonses should be issued three to five days in advance. (2) Many cadres harbored the idea of being bothered by accepting cases, always wanting to reduce the number of cases they handled, thus often pushing cases to districts, streets, or delaying resolution. In the future, in addition to establishing specific systems, the attitude of being bothered by cases will be eliminated from all personnel in the court. If the masses have lawsuits, they must be accepted and not refused. Litigation procedures should also be simplified as much as possible. It is stipulated that the judge on duty should personally receive cases every day and promptly inquire and handle them. In handling cases, attention should be paid to protecting human rights in every way. Detention of defendants in minor criminal cases should be especially cautious, and civil defendants should not be detained. Efforts should be made to avoid wasting the masses' time. (4) In the past, judges rarely went to the scene of incidents or districts and streets to conduct in-depth investigations regarding the handling of cases. In the future, if disputes arise in court, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations among the masses before deciding on a resolution. (5) In the past, the policy of publicizing policies and implementing mediation in minor criminal and civil cases to strengthen unity among the masses had achieved great success. However, sometimes, due to poor mediation methods or subjective concerns about mediating cases, some cases that could have been mediated were not. In the future, in-depth investigation and mediation work should be regarded as an important task, and past experiences should be summarized. Assistance should be given to streets in establishing mediation organizations. (6) Bureaucracy in work seriously hinders the improvement of work efficiency, and backlogged cases cannot be resolved quickly. In the future, external procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and internal work plans and procedures should be rigorous and scientific. (7) The political and policy levels of record-keeping personnel are too low, making it impossible to grasp the core issues and meet the requirements of trial work. It has been decided that political and policy education for record-keeping personnel should be strengthened in the future. (Xing)

　　人民自己的法院应多替人民着想
  　张市人民法院检查官僚主义
    【张垣讯】张家口市人民法院检查三个月来的审判工作，并确定今后改进方针。过去审判工作中，存在着官僚主义，主要表现在：（一）发传票多是临时传案，随票到案，这无异拘提。主要是为了自己审判方便，不替当事人设想。确定今后传票最迟应在前一日发，一般民事案传票要在三、五日以前发。（二）许多干部在思想上存在着对接收案件嫌麻烦的思想，总想少收案件，因此往往把案件推到区、街以至拖延不决。今后除规定具体制度外，并从全院人员中清除嫌麻烦的态度。群众有诉讼，就得收，不得拒绝。在诉讼手续上也要力求简化。规定每天由值日审判官亲自接收案件，并要及时讯问处理。在处理案件中，要处处注意保障人权，对轻微刑事，被告人收押应特别慎重，民事被告人不得收押。力求不浪费群众的时间。（四）对案件的处理上，过去审判员亲到事情发生地点或区、街深入调查的事情很少。今后，如当庭问题争执不清，必须深入群众进行调查，再决定处理办法。（五）过去审判轻微的刑事及民事中，采取了宣传政策，实行调解，以加强群众间的团结的方针，曾获得很大成绩。但有时因调解方式不好，或因主观上对案件调解存在着顾虑，致使有些可以调解的案件，没作调解。今后要把深入调查和调解工作作为一项重要工作，并要总结以往的经验。帮助街建立调解组织。（六）工作上的事务主义，严重的妨害了工作效率的提高，积压的案件，不能很快的处理。今后，对外手续要力求简化，内部工作计划手续要力求严密科学化。（七）纪录人员政治水平与政策水平太低，不能抓住中心，不能完成审判工作的要求。确定今后要加强纪录人员的政治教育与政策教育。（兴）
