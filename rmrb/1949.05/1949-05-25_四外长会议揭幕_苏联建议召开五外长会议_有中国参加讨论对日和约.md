　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom opened in Paris on the 23rd. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, at the first meeting, requested that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting periodically discuss the Japanese peace treaty issue with Chinese participation. According to TASS Paris: The Sixth Foreign Ministers' Meeting opened here at the Palais Rose on the 23rd. Participating in the meeting were Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, French Foreign Minister Schuman, US Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, as well as advisors and experts from each Foreign Minister. The Soviet delegation included: General Chuikov, Smirnov, Bogomolov, Semyonov, and Bozloboff. The French delegation included: Baraduc, François-Poncet, Maurice Couve de Murville, and Alphand. The American delegation included: Jessup, Dulles, Murphy, and Bohlen. The British delegation included: Patrick and General Robertson.

    The Foreign Ministers agreed to take turns chairing the meeting, following past procedures. The first meeting was chaired by Schuman.

    The Foreign Ministers passed the following meeting agenda: 1. The issue of German unification, including economic principles, political principles, and Allied control issues. 2. The Berlin issue and the currency issue. 3. Preparatory work for the German peace treaty. 4. The issue of the Austrian peace treaty. After passing the agenda, Vyshinsky called the Foreign Ministers' attention to the fact that it would be incorrect to not consider the Japanese peace treaty issue after the Austrian peace treaty issue was included on the agenda. Regarding this point, Vyshinsky raised a question, namely, when will the Foreign Ministers' Meeting convene, with Chinese participation, to discuss the Japanese peace treaty issue? Vyshinsky explained: I am not suggesting that this issue be included on the agenda of this session. It is enough to resolve the German issue and the Austrian peace treaty issue at this session. However, we rarely meet, so it is best to decide now when the Foreign Ministers' Meeting will reconvene with Chinese participation to discuss the Japanese peace treaty issue.

    Acheson said: The Japanese peace treaty is a complex issue that requires time for consideration. He mentioned that the Far Eastern Commission has already been established, implying that the Japanese peace treaty issue should perhaps be handled by the Far Eastern Commission, rather than by the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Bevin said: He must obtain instructions from the British government because this issue is closely related to the British Dominions—Australia, New Zealand, India, and other countries.

    In response to Acheson, Vyshinsky reminded the Foreign Ministers' Meeting that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated very clearly: "The Council has reached agreement concerning the necessary preparatory work for peace settlements for consideration by a Council composed of representatives of the five principal powers." The five countries are the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The Potsdam Agreement further pointed out: In preparing peace treaties, the Council of Foreign Ministers will be composed of members representing those states which were signatory to the Terms of Surrender imposed upon the enemy state concerned. Vyshinsky said that until now, according to these regulations, China had not participated in the preparation of many peace treaties. However, the Japanese peace treaty must be prepared by a Foreign Ministers' Meeting with Chinese participation, because China also imposed surrender terms on Japan. When Vyshinsky addressed Bevin's remarks that the British Dominions were concerned about the preparation of the Japanese peace treaty, he pointed out: Countries such as Australia and New Zealand should naturally be given the opportunity to participate in the conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty, but this should be at an appropriate stage. As for the initial preparatory work for the peace treaty, it must be carried out by a Foreign Ministers' Meeting composed of members as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement.

    Vyshinsky's opinion was not opposed. Chairman Schuman suggested that the issue raised by the Soviet delegation be left for discussion at a future meeting during this Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

    The first meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting ended at this point, lasting three hours.

　　四外长会议揭幕
    苏联建议召开五外长会议  有中国参加讨论对日和约
    【新华社北平二十四日电】苏法美英四国外长会议已于二十三日在巴黎开幕。苏外长维辛斯基在第一次会议上曾要求外长会议定期在中国参加之下讨论对日和约问题。据塔斯社巴黎讯：第六届外长会议于二十三日在此间玫瑰宫开幕。参加会议的是苏外长维辛斯基，法外长舒曼，美国务卿艾契逊，英外相贝文，以及各外长的顾问和专家。苏联代表团包括：崔可夫将军、斯米尔诺夫、鲍格莫洛夫、塞苗洛夫和鲍兹洛勃。法国代表团包括：巴洛第、佛朗西斯、庞赛、摩维尔和亚尔朋。美国代表团包括：耶塞普、杜勒斯、莫菲和波伦。英国代表团包括：巴特里克和罗伯逊将军。
    各外长同意依照过去已有的程序，由各外长轮流担任主席。第一次会议由舒曼任主席。
    各外长通过下列会议议程：一、德国统一问题，包括经济原则、政治原则及盟国管制问题。二、柏林问题及货币问题。三、对德和约准备工作。四、对奥和约问题。在通过议程之后，维辛斯基提请外长会议注意：在对奥和约问题列入议程之后不想到对日和约问题是不对的。关于这点，维辛斯基提出一个问题，即规定外长会议在什么时候、在中国参加之下开会，以讨论对日和约问题。维辛斯基解释说：我并不是建议将这个问题列入本届会议议程之内。在本届会议上解决德国问题和对奥和约问题就够了。但是我们很少开会，因此，最好就在现在决定外长会议什么时候在中国参加之下再次开会，以讨论对日和约问题。
    艾契逊说：对日和约是一个复杂的问题，需要有时间加以考虑。他提到远东委员会已经建立，以此暗示对日和约问题或许要由远东委员会，而不是由外长会议来处理。贝文说：他必须得到英国政府的训令，因为这个问题远与英国自治领——澳大利亚、新西兰、印度等国有关。
    维辛斯基在答复艾契逊时提醒外长会议说：波茨坦协议规定得很清楚：“关于建议由五个主要国家组成的外长会议以继续进行媾和的必要准备工作，本会已达协议。”五国为苏、美、英、法、中。波茨坦协议更指出：在准备和约时，为执行每一项这种任务，外长会议将由曾在有关敌国投降条款上签字的国家的代表组成。维辛斯基说，直到现在，依照这些规定，中国并未参加许多和约的准备工作。但是，对日和约必须有中国参加的外长会议准备，因为中国也曾以投降条款加诸日本。维辛斯基论及贝文提及英国自治领关心对日和约准备的谈话时指出：象澳大利亚和新西兰这些国家，自然应当予以参加缔结对日和约的机会，但是，这应在适当的阶段。至于和约的初步准备工作，则必须由按波茨坦协议规定的成份组成的外长会议来进行。
    维辛斯基的意见未遭反对。主席舒曼建议苏联代表团所提出的问题，留交本届外长会议中的某一次会议上讨论。
    外长会议的第一次会议至此结束，历时三小时。
