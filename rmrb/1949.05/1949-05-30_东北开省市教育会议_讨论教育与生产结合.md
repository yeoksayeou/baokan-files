Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th — In order to draft the Northeast education plan and prepare for the Fourth Northeast Education Conference, the Education Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee convened a meeting of the directors of education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities from the 11th to the 18th of this month. The meeting discussed the draft of the Northeast education plan and also discussed the issue of integrating education work with production and construction. The meeting held that with the liberation of the entire Northeast, the central task has now shifted to production and construction. Therefore, cultural and educational work must also be integrated with production and construction, especially serving the primary task of industrial construction. To this end, education work must cultivate a large number of revolutionary intellectual cadres with revolutionary ideas, modern cultural knowledge, and science and technology. Therefore, Northeast education work must first concentrate on reforming and developing secondary and higher education, and train construction talents in a planned way, especially industrial talents, in order to meet the increasing needs of various production departments for cadres year by year. Secondly, gradually universalize primary education and adult literacy education, first and foremost the political and cultural education of workers. The meeting also discussed the issue of educational funding to ensure the consolidation and development of education, and the issue of transforming the work style of educators. The meeting held that educators should overcome empiricism and handicraft methods ideologically and in their practical work, strengthen planning, overcome blindness, and strengthen the study of political theory and professional work, striving to push forward various construction tasks on the basis of the new Northeast education.

　　东北开省市教育会议
  　讨论教育与生产结合
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】东北行政委员会教育部为了草拟东北教育计划及准备东北第四届教育会议，于本月十一日至十八日召开各省、市教育厅、局长会议，讨论了东北教育计划草案，并联系讨论了教育工作与生产建设结合问题。会议认为东北全境解放，今后中心任务转为生产建设，因而文化教育工作亦必须与生产建设结合，特别应为首要的工业建设服务。为此，教育工作必须培养大量的具有革命思想、现代文化知识与科学技术的革命知识分子干部。因此东北教育工作今后首先须集中力量改革与发展中等以上学校，有计划地培养建设人才，特别是工业人才，以便供应各生产部门逐年增大的干部需要。其次是逐渐普及小学教育与成人补习教育，首先是工人的政治的和文化的教育。会议还讨论了保证巩固与发展教育事业的教育经费问题及教育工作者转变作风问题。会议认为今后教育工作者应从思想上和在实际工作中克服经验主义和手工业方式，加强计划性，克服盲目性，同时加强政治理论和业务的学习，力求在新的东北教育的基础上把各项建设工作推进一步。
