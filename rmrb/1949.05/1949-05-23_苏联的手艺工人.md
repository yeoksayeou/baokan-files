　　Soviet Artisans
　　By Degtiarev
　　Translated by Ji Yin
　　You may call Soviet industry the world’s largest industrial concern, but it does not threaten the interests of small handicraft workers. On the contrary, the owner of this concern—if you can call it that—the state, shows great concern for artisans.
　　According to our laws, private handicraft workers can live and work in peace as long as they do not exploit hired labor. Therefore, in any city in the Soviet Union, you can see tailors, shoemakers, and watchmakers working alone or with the assistance of their families. Even more common are production cooperatives, because the vast majority of our artisans have come to understand the benefits of working together and helping each other.
　　The Soviet state has always provided these cooperatives with enormous assistance, providing them with locations and often providing them with the necessary equipment, raw materials, and fuel in the form of loans. The cooperatives take orders for state-owned industrial production and manufacture a wide variety of consumer goods.
　　People abroad generally believe that there is no difference between artisans participating in cooperatives, collective farm peasants, and workers employed in state-owned enterprises. This is only true in one respect: they are all working not only for themselves, but also for the entire country. However, handicraft cooperatives are by no means state-owned enterprises, although the state does provide general guidance in their production activities. Factories, products, and funds are the property of the cooperative, that is, the property of the members, and cannot be taken away. The cooperative's business is managed by a board of directors, which is elected by secret ballot. The board of directors is accountable to the members and must report its work to the members' meeting, which is the highest authority in the cooperative. Soviet industrial cooperatives have nothing in common with joint-stock companies in capitalist countries. Each member must pay a share of the capital according to his income, and if he wants to withdraw, he can withdraw his share. Each member has only one vote, regardless of the amount of his share, and most importantly, he must personally work for the cooperative.
　　I am an old hardware worker, and I have been a member of the cooperative since it was founded. If you ask me what benefits I have received from the cooperative, I can tell you that the cooperative frees artisans from poverty and gives them economic security, which is what distinguishes the working people of the Soviet Union from the working people under capitalism.
　　Needless to say, not every cooperative is doing well, but no cooperative has gone bankrupt. This is the result of the fact that there is no competition of the big fish eating the small fish in our country, the assistance given by the socialist state, and the extensive mutual assistance among the cooperatives. All cooperatives belong to the Producers' Union, which is led by a council elected by the members. The products of labor organizations belonging to a certain production cooperative federation are sold at the same price in all stores of the federation.
　　Cooperative banks in various industries grant low-interest loans according to the financial situation of each cooperative. Our cooperative borrowed 3.35 million rubles at an interest rate of one percent, to be repaid in ten years. We are using this money to build a new building and purchase a large number of machines and equipment. This money enables us to increase production by 40 percent, start producing bicycles and motorboats, and greatly improve the working conditions of our members.
　　Because our cooperative business is doing well, I believe we will receive a loan of about one million rubles next year on the same terms for construction expenses. None of us is worried about not being able to repay this money, because the planned economy, the state's continuous orders, and the increase in the people's purchasing power guarantee the market for our products.
　　Our financial situation has stabilized, largely due to the fact that each member constantly strives to improve labor productivity and reduce production costs, and another reason is the government's post-war measures. At the end of 1946, the government gave the cooperatives many privileges, especially greatly reducing the profit tax.
　　Net profit is distributed according to the opinion of the members' meeting. Last year, 40 percent of the net profit was added to the capital, 20 percent was used for bonuses for outstanding workers and various expenses to improve the living standards of the members, and the remaining 40 percent was distributed to the members.
　　This last 40 percent can be called a kind of bonus, which is distributed not according to capital but according to the labor invested. Last year, one ruble of wages was divided into eleven kopecks; therefore, the better the members work, the more dividends they receive. This year, the profit is expected to double. That means we will have more funds to improve the lives of our members and give them more dividends.
　　In the Soviet Union, social insurance not only protects workers and staff in state-owned industries and state organs, but also benefits the artisans in the cooperatives. Production cooperatives also have their own social insurance, the funds of which are paid by each cooperative, the amount of which reaches more than one-tenth of the wages. The social insurance fund pays sick and maternity benefits on the same basis as workers and staff in state-owned organizations. Like other workers and staff, the cooperative provides sanatorium beds at 30 percent or completely free of charge, the difference being that one is paid by the insurance fund and the other is paid by a special fund designated to improve the living standards of the members.
　　Cooperative members have the same opportunities to improve their skills as workers in state-owned enterprises. We also have Stakhanov schools, where the best workers pass on their skills to others. And you can also enter other training classes to study. This year, Leningrad will reopen a college to train engineers and cooperative economists, which was closed due to the war. Students receive the same salary. However, we have a large number of experts who have succeeded in self-study in their spare time.
　　An example of self-study success is our cooperative's chief engineer, Chayovenz, who used to be in charge of managing our store. He has graduated from a night school. The cooperative gave him all the help he needed during his studies, and during the half year he was preparing his graduation thesis, he was exempted from his work and paid his salary as usual.
　　The cooperative's cultural palace is located near the cooperative site. It was built with cultural and entertainment funds, and the cooperative donates an amount equivalent to 3 percent of wages to this fund.
　　This cultural palace has excellent facilities, with hundreds of various rooms and halls. It is one of the most beautiful theaters in Leningrad, with a huge movie screening room, library, etc. Members spend most of their time here. Striving to learn cultural knowledge is a characteristic of artisans. Their horizons are no longer limited to the small world of the workshop.
　　Soviet artisan cooperative members are active builders of communist society.

　　苏联的手艺工人
    第格梯雅列夫  作

    你也许把苏联的工业叫做世界上最巨大的工业康采恩，可是，它却并不威胁小手工业工人的利益。相反的，这个康采恩的所有人——如果可以这样称呼它的话——国家，对手艺工人表示极大的关心。
    根据我国法律，只要不剥削雇佣劳动，私营手工业者可以安居乐业。因此，你在苏联的任何一个城市中，都可看到成衣匠、制鞋匠、钟表匠独自地或在他的家属协助下工作着。而更常见的却是生产合作社，因为我国绝大部分手艺工人已经了解共同努力、互相帮助的好处。
    苏维埃国家一向给这些合作社以巨大帮助，供给它们社址，并且常以贷款方式给它们以必要的装备、原料和燃料。合作社为国营工业生产定货，并制造各种各样的消费品。
    国外的人一般认为参加合作社的手艺工人、集体农场农民和受雇于国营企业中的工人之间，是没有任何区别的。这只在一点上是对的，那就是他们全不仅是为他们自己工作，而且是为整个国家工作。然而，手工工艺合作社决不是国营企业，虽然国家在它们的生产活动方面确实给以一般的指导。工厂、产品和基金都是合作社的财产，也就是社员的财产，不能加以剥夺。合作社的业务由理事会主持，理事会是以秘密投票方式选举的。理事会向社员负责，并必需向社员大会报告工作，社员大会是合作社中最高权力机关。苏联工业合作社与资本主义国家的合股公司毫无相同之处。每个社员固然要依其所得按期缴纳股金，万一他想脱离，他即可退股。每个社员不论他的股金多少，只有一票表决权，而最重要的是他必须亲自为合作社工作。
    我是一个老五金工人，而且当合作社一成立，我就是社员。如果你问我从合作社中得到什么好处，我可以告诉你，合作社使手艺工人免除穷困，并给他们以经济安全，这是苏联劳动人民与资本主义下的劳动人民不同的地方。
    不消说，合作社中并不是每个成绩都是很好的，但是没有一个合作社破产。这是我国没有大鱼吃小鱼的竞争，社会主义国家给以帮助和各合作社广泛互助的结果。一切合作社都属于生产者联盟，它是由社员选举的理事会领导的。属于一定生产合作社联合会的劳动组合的产品，由联合会的所有商店中以同等价格出售。
    各业合作社银行依照每个合作社的财政情况，贷予低利贷款。我们的合作社以一分利息借到三百三十五万卢布借款，分十年偿还。我们用这笔钱正在建筑一个新的大厦，而且购置了大批机器和设备。这笔钱使我们能增产百分之四十，开始生产自行车和汽船摩托，并大大改善社员的工作条件。
    由于我们的合作社事业办的不坏，我相信我们明年收获得同样条件的约百万卢布贷款，以作建筑经费。我们之中没有一个人担心还不起这一笔钱，因为计划经济、国家源源不绝的定货，和人民购买力的提高，保证了我们出品的销场。
    大部分由于每个社员经常努力提高劳动生产力和减低生产成本的结果，使我们的财政情况趋于稳定，另一原因则为政府战后的措施，政府在四六年底给合作社以许多特权，特别是大大减少利润税。
    纯利依社员大会的意见加以支配。去年纯利之百分之四十加入资本金中，百分之二十作优秀工人的奖金和各种提高社员生活水平的经费，馀下的百分之四十则分给各社员。
    最后这百分之四十可以叫做一种红利，这种红利不是按资本而是按所投下的劳力分配的。去年，一个卢布的工资分得十一戈比；因此，社员工作得愈好；分红就愈多。今年预料利润将增加一倍。那就意味着我们将有更多基金来改善社员的生活和使社员分得更多的红利。
    在苏联，社会保险不但保护国营工业与国家机关中的工人和职员，而且也惠及合作社的手艺工人。生产合作社也有自己的社会保险，基金由各社支付，其数目达工资的十分之一以上。社会保险基金在国营组织的工人和职员同样基础上，付给病人和产妇。象其他工人和职员一样，合作社供给收费百分之三十或完全免费的疗养床位，其不同处在一由保险基金拨款支付，一由指定作改善社员生活水平的特别基金中支付。
    合作社社员具有与国营企业工人同样的改进技术机会。我们也有斯泰哈诺夫学校，最优秀的工人在学校中把技艺传授他人。而且还可入其他训练班学习。今年列宁格勒将重新开办一个训练工程师和合作社经济人员的学院，这个学院曾因战争而停办。学生照样得到薪资。可是，我们拥有大批专家，他们都是利用工余时间自学成功的。
    自学成功的一例是我们社的总工程师查伊翁兹，他过去负管理我们商店之责。他已在一个夜间专门学校毕业。合作社在他就学期间给他以一切帮助，在他准备毕业论文的半年中，免除他的工作，照常付给他工资。
    合作社的文化宫就在社址附近。这是用文化娱乐基金建筑的，合作社捐助相当于工资的百分之三的款项作该项基金。
    这个文化宫有优良的设备，有几百个各种房间和大厅，是列宁格勒最漂亮的剧场之一，有一个巨大的电影放映室、图书馆等。社员在这里消磨大部分时间。努力学习文化知识，是手艺工人的一个特点。他们的眼界已经不局限于工场那块小天地了。
    苏联手艺工人合作社社员是共产主义社会的积极建设者。
