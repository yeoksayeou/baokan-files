    Do a Good Job in Summer Epidemic Prevention
    Summer is here, and Party, government, army, and civilians in all regions must be highly vigilant against the spread of infectious diseases and do a good job in summer epidemic prevention and health work. Cities with concentrated populations should pay particular attention.
    This spring, we have already achieved considerable success in epidemic prevention work, and the epidemics that have occurred in various places have gradually been eliminated. The serious cattle plague in Chahar has been completely eradicated. In Taihang, Jizhong, and other places, the organized and planned publicity to the masses about epidemic prevention and treatment is absolutely necessary and should be learned from everywhere.
    At present, most areas in North China are experiencing drought, and epidemics are most likely to occur. Since the beginning of spring, epidemic diseases have successively occurred in Taihang, Jinzhong, Jizhong, Jidong, Chahar, Shijiazhuang and other places. In Pingding, Taihang, a village of about one hundred households had more than one hundred and thirty people contracting infectious diseases. In Tongxian and Sanhe counties in Jidong, more than nine hundred and seventy people have died from smallpox and measles. This is a major detriment to our current large-scale production and construction. Our cadres, not only health cadres, but all cadres, should pay serious attention, report the situation to higher authorities at any time, and organize forces for epidemic prevention and treatment to reduce the harm to the masses. Many places have done this and have achieved remarkable results.
    In the past and in some areas and cities now, there is still a phenomenon of neglecting health work, which should be changed quickly. Cadres at all levels must lead the masses in earnestly carrying out this major task of treating diseases and saving lives. Any indifferent or numb attitude will cause undue harm to the masses and cause great errors in work.

    作好夏天的防疫工作
    夏天到了，各地党政军民，必须高度的警惕流行病的传染，作好夏天的防疫卫生工作。城市人口集中，更应特别注意。
    今春我们在防疫工作上，已经获得了相当的成绩，各地发生的流行病已经逐渐消灭了。察北严重的牛瘟，则已根本扑灭。太行、冀中等地，更有组织有计划的向群众宣传防疫与治疗，这是完全必要的，各地应当学习。
    目前华北多数地区已呈旱象，疫病最易流行。入春以来，太行、晋中、冀中、冀东、察哈尔、石家庄市等地均相继发生了流行性的病疫，太行平定一个百十户的村庄就有一百三十余人得了传染病，冀东通县、三河两县，因患天花麻疹，已死九百七十余人；对于我们当前大规模的生产建设，这是一种最大的损害。我们的干部，不仅是卫生干部，包括所有干部，应该认真的注意起来，随时向上级报告情况，并组织力量防疫治疗，减少群众的损害。许多地方这样作了，已收到了显著的成绩。
    过去与现在某些地区，某些城市还存在着对卫生工作忽视的现象，应该迅速加以改变。各级干部必须领导群众，认真的执行这一治病救人的重大任务。各种熟视无睹或麻木不仁的态度，都会使群众遭受不应有的损害，造成工作中极大的错误。
