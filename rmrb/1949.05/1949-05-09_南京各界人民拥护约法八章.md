Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th: The Eight-Point Covenant promulgated by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu has been praised and supported by people from all walks of life in Nanjing. Many workers have launched discussions on this proclamation, feeling that bureaucratic capital is the blood and sweat of the working people and must be taken over by the People's Government. After studying it, the Nanjing Clothing Factory workers immediately reorganized their employee organization to prevent bad elements from mixing in and sabotaging, and prepared to quickly resume work. The industrial and commercial sectors believe that the confiscation of bureaucratic capital has cleared the obstacles to the development of industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and they can now devote themselves to production. Employees of the China Cement Company said that before the People's Liberation Army arrived in Nanjing, they heard the Eight-Point Covenant on the radio, so they continued cement production without interruption. Employees of the Jinghua Printing Bureau urged the manager, who had been frightened away by rumors spread by Kuomintang secret agents, to return to resume business. Most of the staff working in the Nanjing reactionary government organs, after seeing that the Eight-Point Covenant stipulated that they would be "granted employment according to their abilities," dispelled their concerns and properly kept documents and materials, waiting for the Military Control Commission to take over. Students from various schools felt that with the promulgation of the Eight-Point Covenant, people's hearts were at peace, and all the rumors and slanders of the Kuomintang reactionaries were shattered. Some professors from Nanjing Central University, Jinling University, and other universities believe that the Eight-Point Covenant represents the interests of the majority of the people.

    南京各界人民拥护约法八章
    【新华社南京七日电】毛主席、朱总司令颁布的约法八章受到南京各界人民的赞颂与拥护。很多工人们对这一文告展开了讨论，他们感到官僚资本是劳动人民的血汗，必须由人民政府接管。南京被服厂职工进行学习后，立即整顿职工组织，防止坏分子混人破坏，准备迅速复工。工商业界认为没收官僚资本，对有益于国计民生的工商业的发展扫清了障碍，今后可以全力进行生产了。中国水泥公司职员说，解放军到南京前，他们从广播中听到约法八章，于是便继续水泥生产，从未间断。京华印刷局的职员则敦促被国民党特务所施放的谣言吓跑的经理回来复业。南京反动政府机关中工作的大部分职员看到约法八章规定对他们“准予量才录用”后消除了顾虑，而且妥善的保管着文件物资，等待军管会接管。各校学生们觉得约法八章一公布，人心安定，过去国民党反动派的造谣污蔑全被粉碎。南京中大、金陵等大学校若干教授认为约法八章代表了大多数人民的利益。
