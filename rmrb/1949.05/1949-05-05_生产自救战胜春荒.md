    Production Self-Salvation to Overcome the Spring Famine
    Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government
    The Famine Situation
    The spring famine this year is severe in some areas of our North China Liberated Area. Based on the different causes of the famine, the areas can be roughly divided into the following three categories: First, some areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan (冀鲁豫) that suffered severe damage when the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the truce agreement and unreasonably attacked us, such as 29 counties including Yutai, Jining, and Kunshan. These areas suffered heavy damage and are difficult to recover from in a short period of time. In addition, there was drought followed by floods last year, and the Yellow River dikes were destroyed by Kuomintang aircraft bombing, causing floods in lakes such as Nanyang, Weishan, and Shushan, making the famine even more serious. About 700,000 to 800,000 people in these areas are suffering from famine due to lack of food, livestock, and farm tools, making spring plowing very difficult. For example, in the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions (专区), half of the spring land has not yet been plowed. Second, the newly liberated areas that have suffered from the long-term rule, exploitation, plunder, and robbery of the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan bandits, such as Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Huixian, Anyang, Ye County, and Tang County in Taihang, the Tenth Administrative Region and parts of the Eighth and Ninth Administrative Regions in Central Hebei, the no-man's land of 200 li from Yihua and Huairou to Changping in Chahar, and the First and Third Administrative Regions in Central Shanxi. When Ye County and other areas in Taihang were liberated last year, there were already 300,000 famine victims, and a large part of them are still threatened by the famine. There are about 300,000 famine victims in Central Hebei, and there are more than 80,000 mu of wasteland in the five counties of Ba, Xiong, etc. In the disaster area of Central Shanxi, there are more than 260 villages with a population of about 160,000. After liberation, there were 1.5 million mu of wasteland. Through the efforts of the people under the leadership of the People's Government to eliminate the famine, there are still 1.1 million mu now. Third, the old liberated areas that suffered reduced harvests due to floods, droughts, and insect pests last year, such as the Third and Fourth Administrative Regions and part of the Fifth Administrative Region in Southern Hebei, and Wen'an, Raoyang, and Gaoyang in Central Hebei, the Jianping Administrative Region in Chahar Province, and part of the flood-stricken areas in the Fifteenth Administrative Region in Eastern Hebei. Although the people have made arduous efforts to combat these disasters, greatly reducing the famine, there are still many places that have suffered unavoidable losses, resulting in famine.

    In total, there are about 2 million famine victims in the entire region, and the famine victims in the severely affected areas account for about one-tenth of the total number of famine victims. The situation is more serious in the newly liberated areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Central Shanxi, Central Hebei, and Chahar Province, followed by Jianping in Chahar Province, and the situation in Eastern Hebei is not clear.
  
  Waging a Victorious Battle Against the Famine
    Our region has rich experience in fighting disasters, and the Party and the People's Government have taken necessary measures to deal with these famines. In the newly liberated areas such as Central Shanxi, as soon as they were liberated last autumn, attention was paid to organizing the masses to vigorously eliminate wasteland and rush to plant wheat, so as not to prolong the famine. The Central Shanxi Administrative Office promulgated reward measures for eliminating wasteland and increasing livestock, which played a great role. In Central Shanxi alone, 300,000 mu of wasteland were eliminated in one or two months. In the flood-stricken areas, the accumulated water was drained and wheat was rushed to be planted. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 265 drainage ditches were dug, and 2 million hectares of land were drained. The government loaned 940,000 jin of wheat seeds, expanding the wheat fields, which played a great role in shortening the famine and stabilizing the confidence of the famine victims in production and self-salvation. Then, during winter production, sideline loans were issued and sideline production was organized to prepare for spring plowing. The Taihang area has solved the living problems of 100,000 famine victims, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Central Hebei have also achieved great results. The North China People's Government, the Chahar Provincial Government, and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office have successively issued emergency instructions on production and disaster relief, calling on the Party, government, army, and people in the disaster areas to mobilize and fight against the famine, and to make production and disaster relief the overriding central task in areas with severe famine. Chahar Province established a production and disaster relief committee, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan established disaster area production and marketing cooperatives and production and transportation loan offices. The trade departments and production promotion agencies, combined with the purchase of disaster victims' products, supplied raw materials, seeds, and farm tools to help the masses overcome the spring famine and complete spring plowing. The specific achievements can be seen from two aspects:

    1.  In terms of production and self-salvation: First of all, various kinds of sideline production are organized, such as transportation, kiln burning, making farm tools, weaving mats, fishing, grinding flour, and pressing oil. For example, in Ningnan, with the direct support of the production promotion agency, ten villages obtained more than 586,000 jin of rice in three months. Secondly, work-for-relief is implemented, such as repairing roads, digging rivers, building dikes, and transporting public grain and coal. In Taihang alone, the masses who repaired the Qin River and repaired bridges to transport coal received wages equivalent to more than 470,000 jin of rice. Then, social mutual assistance and mutual relief were launched. In the non-disaster areas of the Jianping Administrative Region of Chahar Province, the "one jin of jujubes" and "one handful of millet" campaign was proposed. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the "smoke one less pack of cigarettes" and "eat one less meal" campaign was proposed to raise bran and vegetables to support production in the disaster areas. For example, Ding Guantun, a village in Juye, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, resettled 100 famine-stricken households. The farmers in the village automatically lent out houses and production tools. For example, women lent out 40 spinning wheels, fully demonstrating the class friendship of farmers all over the world as one family. In other parts of Chahar Province and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, many cadres saved on food and clothing to help the famine victims, sharing weal and woe with the masses.

    2.  In terms of spring plowing, eliminating wasteland, and planting early-maturing crops: In the flood-stricken areas such as Xian County, Wen'an, Wenxin in Central Hebei, Yutian in the Fifteenth Administrative Region of Eastern Hebei, and En County in Southern Hebei, the masses, with the help of the government, rushed to plant barley and spring wheat. In Central Hebei, six villages in Wen'an alone have planted more than 2,700 mu of barley. En County loaned 2,700 jin of big-leaf sorghum (an early-maturing crop) to the flood-stricken areas. Some areas organized manpower and animal power from non-disaster areas to rush to spring plowing in the disaster areas. For example, En County organized 1,000 head of cattle to plow the land in the disaster areas. Before the thaw, the Yixian Administrative Office in Chahar Province organized cattle to rush to eliminate the uncultivated land in the disaster areas, which played a great role in eliminating wasteland. Chengwu County in Hebei-Shandong-Henan organized the people and animals in the disaster areas to exchange labor, or exchange grass and fodder for plowing cattle, solving the difficulty of not having grass and fodder for households with cattle, and also solving the difficulty of not having land to cultivate for households without cattle.

  Opinions for the Future
    Although we paid attention to production and disaster relief work early on and have achieved many results, some areas have suffered some losses due to the severity of the famine and the paralysis and neglect of leadership. For example, Yihua County in Chahar Province, and Xinxian and Yangqu Counties in Central Shanxi, took a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to the famine for a long time, making the famine even worse. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan area also suffered some losses due to the late start of the work. This irresponsible attitude towards the people has also been criticized and corrected. According to the current situation, tree leaves and wild grass have already come out. Coupled with the relief grain issued by the government, rapidly strengthening the leadership of production and disaster relief, solving various difficulties for the famine victims in spring plowing, and ensuring timely sowing are the current urgent tasks. If each Administrative Office has surplus public grain, it can be used as a wheat loan, and recovered after the wheat harvest to support the production of the famine victims. Secondly, the problem of sideline production outlets in the disaster areas should be solved. Trade departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and production promotion agencies should systematically absorb local products and finished products, open up sales channels, and organize general sideline laborers with no prospects to turn to other sideline industries that non-machine production can replace. Finally, the leadership in the disaster areas must truly regard production and disaster relief work as the overriding central task and resolutely correct the phenomenon of empty slogans about the importance of production while actually letting it go unchecked.

    生产自救战胜春荒
    华北人民政府农业部
    灾荒情况
    我华北解放区部分地区，今年春荒严重。根据灾荒形成的不同原因，约可分以下三类地区：一是国民党反动派撕毁停战协定后，无理向我进攻时遭受严重破坏的冀鲁豫部分地区，如鱼台、济宁、昆山等二十九县。这些地区因遭受破坏惨重，一时难于恢复，又加去年先旱后涝，黄河堤岸遭受国民党飞机的轰炸摧毁，南阳、微山、蜀山等湖漫堤成灾，致灾荒更加严重。这些地区约有七、八十万灾民因缺口粮、牲口、农具，春耕很困难，如三、五专区有一半春地尚未犁起。二是由于日寇、蒋、阎匪的长期统治、压榨、抢掠成灾的新解放区，如太行之修武、武陟、辉县、安阳、邺县、汤县、冀中十专区及八、九专区各一部，察哈尔的乙化、怀柔到昌平二百里的无人区，和晋中一、三专区等地。太行邺县等在去年解放时，即有三十万灾民，现仍有大部受灾荒威胁。冀中灾民约三十万左右，霸、雄等五县即有荒地八万余亩。晋中灾区二百六十余村，人口约十六万，在解放后荒地即有一百五十万亩，经人民政府领导人民努力灭荒，现在还有一百一十万亩。三是由于去年水、旱、虫灾而减收的老解放区。如冀南三、四专区、及五专区一部、冀中文安、饶阳、高阳等地，察哈尔省的建屏专区，及冀东十五专区的一部水灾地区。这些地区虽经人民的艰苦抗斗，使灾荒大加缩减，但仍有不少地方遭受不可避免的损失，因而形成灾荒。
    总计全区灾民约有二百万左右，重灾区的灾民约占总灾民数的十分之一。其中以冀鲁豫、晋中、冀中、察省新解放区较重，察省建屏次之，冀东不详。
  向灾荒作胜利地战斗
    我区已有了与灾害作斗争的丰富经验，而对着这些灾荒，党和人民政府进行了必要的措施。晋中等新解放区，于去年秋刚解放时，就注意组织群众大力消灭荒地，突击种麦，不使灾荒延续下去。晋中行署曾颁布消灭荒地，增加牲口的奖励办法，起了很大作用。仅晋中一两个月，就消灭荒地三十万亩。在水灾区，疏导积水突击种麦，在冀鲁豫，挖排水沟二百六十五条，涸出土地二百万顷，政府贷麦种九十四万斤、使麦田扩大、这对缩短灾荒、安定灾民生产自救信心起了很大作用。接着就是在冬季生产中，发放副业贷款，组织副业生产，为春耕作准备。太行区曾解决了十万灾民的生活问题，冀南冀中也有很大的成绩，华北人民政府，察哈尔省政府、冀鲁豫行署，先后发出生产救灾的紧急指示，号召灾区党政军民动员起来向灾荒作斗争，在灾荒严重的地区，以生产救灾为压倒一切的中心工作。察省成立了生产救灾委员会，冀鲁豫成立灾区生产供销合作社、生产运输贷款所，贸易部门及生产推行社，结合收购灾民生产品，供给原料、种子、农具，帮助群众，渡过春荒，完成春耕。具体成绩可从两方面来看：
    一、在生产自救方面：首先组织各种各样的副业生产，如运输、烧窑、造农具、编席、捕鱼、磨粉、榨油等。如宁南灾民在生产推进社的直接扶持下，三个月十个村即得米五十八万六千余斤。其次以工代赈，如修路、挖河、筑堤、运送公粮、煤炭等，仅太行修治沁河和修桥运煤群众得工资折米四十七万余斤，再即发动社会互助互济，在察省建屏专区的非灾区，提出“一斤枣”“一枸米”运动，冀鲁豫提出“少吸一盒烟”“少吃一顿菜”运动，募集糠菜，支援灾区生产。如冀鲁豫钜野丁官屯一个村，即安置了一百户灾民，该村农民自动借出房子和生产工具，如妇女就借给四十辆纺车，充分表现天下农民是一家的阶级友爱的精神。其他察省、冀鲁豫不少干部节衣缩食，救济灾民，与群众同患难共甘苦。
    二、在春耕灭荒种植早熟作物方面：在水灾区如冀中献县、文安、文新，冀东十五专区之玉田，冀南的恩县等地群众，在政府帮助之下赶种大麦春麦。冀中仅文安六村统计，已播种大麦二千七百余亩，恩县贷大叶高粮（早熟作物）二千七百斤给水灾区。有的地区组织非灾区的人力畜力到灾区突击春耕。如恩县组织耕畜一千犋到灾区犁地，察省易县专署在解冻前。就组织牛犋到灾区突击消灭白茬地，对消灭荒地起了很大作用。冀鲁豫城武县组织灾区群众人畜力变工，或以草料换耕畜犁地，解决有牛户的没草料困难，也解决没牛户的耕地困难。
  今后的意见
    虽然我们及早注意了生产救灾工作，且已获得不少成绩，但有些地区因灾荒特重，及领导上对灾荒的麻痹和忽视，也受到些损失。如察省乙化县、晋中忻县、阳曲，很长时间对灾荒采取漠不关心的官僚主义的态度，使灾荒更加发展。冀鲁豫地区也因动手较晚受到部分损失，这种对人民不负责的态度也已受到批评和纠正。根据目前情况，树叶野草已经出来，配上政府发下的救济粮，迅速加强生产救灾领导，解决灾民春耕中各种困难，保证及时下种，是当前迫切任务、各行署如有节余公粮，可作指麦贷款，麦后收回以支持灾民生产。其次，解决灾区副业出路问题，贸易部门、供销合作社、生产推进社、有计划的吸收土产成品，打开销路，和组织一般没有前途的副业劳力者转向其他非机器生产能代替之副业上去。最后灾区领导上，要真正把生产救灾工作当作压倒一切的中心工作。切实纠正空喊生产重要而实际放任自流的现象。
