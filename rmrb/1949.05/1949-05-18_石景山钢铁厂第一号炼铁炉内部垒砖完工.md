　　Internal Bricklaying of No. 1 Blast Furnace at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Completed
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The internal bricklaying project of the No. 1 250-ton blast furnace, a major component in the production recovery plan of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, has been completed ahead of schedule due to the work competition initiated by the workers to welcome "July 1st". The No. 1 blast furnace was originally planned to be fully repaired and producing iron by "May 1st", but the plan was changed midway due to difficulties in materials and tools. After the North China Iron and Steel Conference established a preliminary production plan for the No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to produce 19,000 tons of pig iron from July 1st to the end of this year, the director of the iron smelting plant immediately convened the workers to discuss how to complete the task on schedule and solved the difficulties in tools such as gloves. At that time, the bricklaying workers proposed to guarantee completion by May 23rd. From the 11th, a team of craftsmen led by An Hui'en challenged another team, dividing the furnace body into two halves to compete. On the first day, their team laid more than four layers, more than double the previous amount. The team led by Han Enping was not to be outdone, laying more than eight layers at a time. From then on, the work progressed rapidly. It used to take a week to raise the scaffolding by one meter, but it gradually became three days to raise the scaffolding by one meter, and finally, it was raised by one meter in two days. The scaffolding workers of the hoisting plant worked after 10 pm to avoid affecting the bricklaying work. Other workers grinding bricks, transporting bricks, soaking soil, and transporting soil also accelerated their pace. Therefore, the project was completed on the 16th, seven days ahead of the original plan. After the project was completed, most of the workers had worn the treads off their fingertips. (Chi)

　　石景山钢铁厂第一号炼铁炉内部垒砖完工
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂恢复生产计划中的主要部门第一号二百五十吨炼炉的内部垒砖工程，因工友们迎接“七一”自动发起工作竞赛，已提前完工。这第一号炼铁炉原来计划在“五一”就要全部修复出铁的，但因材料工具困难，中途改了计划。当华北钢铁会议对石景山钢铁厂第一号炼铁炉要自今年七月一日起至年底出产一万九千吨生铁的初步生产计划订出后，炼铁厂厂长即召集工友商讨如何按期完成，并解决了手套等工具上的困难，当时垒砖工友们即提出保证五月二十三日完成。十一日起，安惠恩所率领的一班匠工就向另一班提出了挑战，将炉体划成两半竞赛起来。第一天他们一班人就砌了四层多，比以前超出一倍多。韩恩平所率领的一班也不甘落后，一次砌了八层多，从此工作突飞猛进，过去要一星期才把架子搭高一米，渐渐成为三天架高一米，最后两天就加高一米。起重厂的搭架子工友们为了不影响垒砖工作，改在晚上十点以后工作。其他磨砖的，运砖的，泡土的，运土的也跟着加快速度，因此十六日就接缝了，比原来计划提前了七天。当工程完成之后，大部分工友的手指磨得螺纹都没有了。　　（炽）
