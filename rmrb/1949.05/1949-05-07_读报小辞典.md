Reading the Newspaper Small Dictionary

    Unemployed Army—The result of capitalist free competition, a few large capitalists' large enterprises monopolize everything, small production—handicrafts, home handicrafts, and small enterprises—are squeezed out and annexed, losing their own means of production. Farmers in rural areas lose their land and become paupers and an industrial reserve army in the cities in the process of continuous deterioration of life. On the other hand, in order to compete and squeeze out each other, capitalists constantly improve machines, increase labor intensity, extend working hours, reduce workers, or employ female and child labor at lower costs, and exploit them more fiercely and cruelly, causing more and more employed workers to become unemployed. Thus, the "surplus" labor force in rural and urban areas forms a large army of unemployed, wandering and starving in capitalist society, forced to endure the capitalists' cruel working conditions and sell their labor. Therefore, the larger the unemployed army, the more capitalists use the lowest cost to hire workers and engage in more exploitation. This is the reason why the monopoly capitalists of American imperialism want more unemployed armies in Japan, South Korea and other colonial countries.

    失业军——资本主义自由竞争的结果，少数大资本家的大企业垄断了一切，小生产——手工业、家庭手工业，以及小企业，都被排挤吞并，失掉了自己的生产手段，农村中的农民，更不断的在生活恶化的过程中失去了土地变成了城市中的贫民和产业后备军；另一方面，资本家为了互相竞争和排挤，就不断的改良机器，提高劳动强度、延长工作时间，减少工人，或以更低廉的代价雇用女工、童工，更凶恶残酷的压榨，使在业工人越来越多的失业，于是农村的城市的“剩余”劳动力，形成了一支失业的大军，在资本主义社会中流离失所，啼饥号寒，被逼得忍受了资本家的残酷的劳动条件出卖自己的劳动力。因之失业军越大，资本家就越用最低廉的代价来雇用工人，从事更多的剥削。这就是美帝国主义的垄断资本家在日本、南朝鲜及其他殖民地国家要有更多的失业军的道理。
