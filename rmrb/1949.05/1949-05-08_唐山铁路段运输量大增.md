    Tangshan Railway Section Transportation Volume Increases Greatly
    [Tangshan Electric] The transportation volume of the Tangshan Railway Section has increased rapidly. From February 10th to March 10th, the total for the entire month was more than 56,000 tons, while from March 10th to April 10th, it reached more than 96,000 tons, an increase of 71%. The number of train runs in March was 1,829, averaging 61 times per day, while in February there were only 1,208 runs. The daily mileage of each locomotive frequently exceeded the 200 kilometers stipulated by the railway bureau. The reason for the increase in transportation volume is the enthusiasm and initiative of the railway workers. The rapid recovery and development of Tangshan's industry and the increase in products also have a stimulating effect on railway transportation. Taking the section under the jurisdiction of the Tangshan Transportation Office (Shanhaiguan to Jinhan River) as an example, the total freight volume in March reached 390,000 tons. Even with busy military transportation, the railway still tried its best to transport coal for Kailuan. The coal from Kailuan accounted for more than 288,000 tons, or about 73%, of the total transportation volume in March.

    唐山铁路段运输量大增
    【唐山电】唐山铁路段运输量迅速增加。从二月十日到三月十日全月为五万六千余吨，而三月十日到四月十日即达九万六千余吨，增加百分之七十一。三月份的行车数量为一千八百二十九次，平均每日有六十一次，二月份却只有一千二百零八次。每台机车的日行公里经常突破路局规定的二百公里，运输量增加的原因，是铁路职工工作的热情和积极。而唐市工业的迅速恢复和发展，产品增加，也对铁路运输有着刺激作用。以唐山运输所辖地段（山海关至金汉河）言，三月份货物总运输量达三十九万吨，虽在军运繁忙中，铁路仍尽量为开滦运煤，三月份总运输量中，开滦的煤占二十八万八千余吨，约占百分之七十三。
