　　Rushing to Plant After the Rain
    Chen Ji

    Farmers, Liberation Army soldiers, and cadres in the western suburbs of Beiping worked together to rush the planting, successfully completing the initial sowing work. At the end of April, the Eighth District People's Government of the western suburbs held a meeting of all cadres to mobilize farmers in various villages to plant seeds, breaking the reliance on weather. In this mobilization, a large number of production models emerged, playing a considerable leading role in mobilizing farmers to plant. Bai Yuzhen, the women's representative of Xiaojia River, voluntarily carried water to plant more than two mu of wheat and led more than a dozen women to dig green grass to supply livestock, using it to exchange for coal. The farmers of Xiaojia River, seeing Bai Yuzhen's successful experience, also followed suit in planting. After planting two and a half mu of land, Yu Yongting said to the farmers: "Even if it doesn't rain, we can still farm." A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the western suburbs also helped farmers carry water and manure, and the cadres also went down to the fields to dig and plow the soil, greatly encouraging the farmers' enthusiasm for production. In the early part of this month, there was a day of rain. In order to speed up planting, they organized mutual aid groups based on the principle of voluntarism, bringing into play the spirit of collective work. In the middle of this month, there was heavy rain. Based on the planting experience, the district people's government called on district and village cadres to take the lead and lead the farmers in a rush planting campaign. Du Chen and Zhu Qian, two revolutionary intellectuals who had not participated in revolutionary work for long, went to the fields for the first time to cultivate the soil and planted more than one mu of corn for the farmers. They told reporters: "By working in the fields, we are not only leading the farmers to produce more enthusiastically, but also learning some labor knowledge from them." Then he excitedly used his fingers to illustrate, saying, "The newly planted corn in our village has already sprouted that long." Cadre Li Shizheng became ill from exhaustion during the rush planting. The farmers said, "Our comrades are busy for us all day long, borrowing livestock from the east and tools from the west, and even borrowing money and grain for us." The farmers of Dazhuang deeply realized that they could only turn themselves over under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. An old woman surnamed Ding, nearly sixty years old, said: "We have the Communist Party, and we have a way. Look, isn't the rush planting a testament to that?" More than a thousand Liberation Army soldiers from a certain regiment stationed in the western suburbs assisted the farmers in the rush planting, winning the love of the vast majority of farmers. After the heavy rain, they worked tirelessly for the farmers from morning till dusk every day. The machine gun company and artillery company's military horses were also mobilized. When a group of Liberation Army soldiers were rushing to plant a piece of land, the owner of the land was not there. They were so anxious that they ran to find the village head and asked the owner to come back quickly. They said, "Quick, quick, if we don't plant now, it will be a disaster! We can't let this ten-odd mu of land be wasted." The farmers of Haidian generally praised the Liberation Army, saying: "The Liberation Army usually carries water and sweeps the floor for us; now they plow the land, dig the soil, and carry manure for us." Zhang Pan's family in Huangzhuang is already sixty-eight years old and has only one child. Watching her two and a half mu of land, which was about to become barren due to drought, was completed in half a day by the enthusiastic work of more than a dozen Liberation Army soldiers. She said, "If it were just my child and me, I don't know how many days it would take to get this done; the Liberation Army came and finished it for us in half a day, saving my child and me." When the Kuomintang reactionaries were struggling in Beiping, they collected a large number of farmers' farming tools to dig trenches. Now the farmers are having a difficult time with tools, and they are using labor instead of tools. When the Liberation Army saw this situation, they said: "We must find a way to solve the bastards' deeds of the Kuomintang. We work for the farmers, even if there are few tools, we can still do it. What are our hands for? It's a waste if we don't work for the farmers." They also said: "We eat the farmers' food, and we wear the farmers' clothes. Today, we are very excited to work for the farmers." The Liberation Army units such as the Training Brigade, the Military Law Office, and the Underground Work Department stationed in the suburbs also helped farmers plant and rush planting outside Deshengmen. After the heavy rain, more than 500 people from the Training Brigade spent two days rushing to plant more than 1,500 mu of dry land for the farmers, which was loved by the farmers.

    Now, the rush planting work in the western suburbs has been completed. Most of the dry land from Xizhimen to Haidian has been planted with corn, peanuts, millet, and sweet potatoes. There are also some paddy fields, which are currently not a problem. In order to regulate urban and rural water use, the Beijing Municipal Government organized the Western Suburbs Water Conservancy Management Committee and decided that the water sources of Yuquan Mountain and Kunming Lake would not be supplied to the city during the rice transplanting period. The water sources of these two places are enough to supply these more than 20,000 mu of paddy fields.

　　雨后抢种
    陈迹
    北平西郊农民、解放军、干部共同抢种，胜利完成了初步播种工作。四月底，西郊第八区人民政府曾召开全体干部会议，动员各村农民点种，打破靠天思想。在这次动员工作中，涌现出大批的生产模范，对于发动农民点种工作起了相当大的带头作用。萧家河妇女会代表白玉珍等自动挑水点种了二亩多麦子，又领着十多个妇女挖青草，供给牲口之用，并以此换取煤炭。萧家河的农民看到白玉珍成功的经验，也多跟着点种起来。于永亭在点种了两亩半地之后，对农民说：“不下雨，咱还不是一样种地。”驻在西郊的某团解放军，也帮助农民挑水、担粪，干部们也多下地挖土、刨土，大大鼓励了农民的生产情绪。本月上旬，曾落了一天雨，他们为要加紧播种，本着自愿原则，组织互助小组，发挥集体工作精神。到了本月中旬，天降大雨，该区人民政府根据点种经验，号召区村干部亲自动手，领导农民突击抢种，有两个参加革命工作没有多久的革命知识份子杜琛和朱潜首次下地耕土，替农民种了一亩多玉米。他们向记者说：“我们下地工作，一方面领导了农民更热情的生产；另方面，我们可以向农民学习些劳动知识。”接着他又兴奋地以手指比喻着说：“我们那村新播种的玉米已生出这么长的苗芽了。”干部李世正在抢种中累病了。农民们说：“咱们的同志整天为咱们忙，东借牲口，西借工具，还要替我们借钱借粮。”大有庄的农民深深的认识到他们只有在中国共产党领导下，才能翻身。有个年近六十的姓丁的老大娘说：“咱们有了共产党，咱们才有办法，你瞧，抢种不是一个见证吗？”驻在西郊的某团千余个解放军，协助农民抢种，更获得了广大农民的爱戴。他们在大雨之后，每天从清晨到黄昏，毫无倦色地为农民工作。机枪连和炮兵连的军马也被发动起来。有一组解放军在抢种一处土地时，该地主人不在，他们急坏了，跑去找闾长，叫主人赶快回来，他们说：“快，快，现在还不播种，就糟哪！我们不能让这块十来亩地荒废下去。”海甸的农民普遍的称赞着解放军说：“解放军，平时替我们挑水扫地；现在又替我们耕地、刨土、挑粪。”黄庄的张潘氏已六十八岁，只有一个小孩，眼看着她的将要荒旱了的两亩半地在十多个解放军的热情工作下，半天就完成了播种。她说：“这块地，要我母儿两个干，不知道要多少天才能搞好；解放军来了，半天的功夫，给我们搞好了，救了我们母儿俩。”国民党反动派在北平垂死挣扎的时候，曾大批征集了农民的耕具去挖战壕，现在农民们的工具都很困难，他们以劳力代替工具。当解放军看到这样情况时，他们说：“国民党干的混蛋事，我们也得想办法解决，我们替农民干活，就是少工具，我们也可以干，我们的手干吗的？不替农民干活，真是白生的。”他们又说：“我们吃的是农民的，穿的也是农民的。今天我们替农民干活，真是兴奋。”驻在近郊的教导大队、军法处及地工部等单位解放军，亦同样在德胜门外帮助农民点种抢种。教导大队五百余人在大雨后，两天功夫，替农民抢种了一千五百余亩旱地，受到农民的敬爱。
    现在，西郊的抢种工作已告完成。从西直门到海甸的旱地，大多已播种了玉米、花生、谷子和白薯。还有一些水田，目前亦无问题。北平市政府为调剂城乡用水，组织西郊水利管理委员会，并决定玉泉山、昆明湖水源在插秧期间，暂不供城内。该两处水源，供给这两万多亩稻田，可以够用了。
