    Master the Coal and Flour Coupon Market
    Tangshan Private Trade Organizations Guarantee Workers' Livelihood
    The Origin and Misery of Miners Being Exploited by Ticket Scalpers
    The Process of State Trade Organizations Fighting Against Unscrupulous Merchants
    Several Problems That Urgently Need to Be Solved
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Our newspaper reporters Lu Lin and Lin Li report: Since the liberation of Tangshan, state trade organizations and trade unions have correctly implemented the policy of safeguarding workers' interests and打击打击 unscrupulous merchants' manipulation of the city's coal and flour coupon market, achieving remarkable results. The facts are reported as follows.
    Coal and flour coupons are a kind of check issued by the Kailuan Mining Bureau to workers as wages, which can be used to collect physical objects – coal and flour. However, when flour cannot be supplied in time, and poverty forces workers to exchange flour for coarse rice or coal for food, workers directly sell coal, flour, or coal and flour coupons. As a result, a large number of unscrupulous merchants swarmed in to buy coal, flour, and checks for profit. Before the liberation of Tangshan, and even until the old New Year, the cruelty of miners being exploited by unscrupulous merchants was truly shocking. At that time, the Mining Bureau had not distributed flour for more than three months, but checks were still issued. As a result, workers starved while looking at a large number of checks. Considering only the checks for two bags of flour and half a ton of coal per person per month, in three months, the more than 11,100 workers of Tangshan Mine No. 1 accumulated 66,600 bags of flour coupons and 16,650 tons of coal coupons. Miners, who usually "have no food to last the day," had no choice but to sell their checks to maintain their lives. At this time, the unscrupulous merchants desperately lowered the price of the checks, even dropping the price twelve times a day. At that time, the market price of flour was 450,000 yuan (old currency, equivalent to 450 yuan in people's currency, same below), but flour coupons only sold for 80,000 yuan. Coal coupons that could usually be exchanged for two to three bags of flour were now only selling for 160,000 yuan. That is to say, unscrupulous merchants could buy checks worth more than five bags of flour with the money for one bag of flour, and the coal coupons worth two to three bags of flour could not even be exchanged for half a bag of flour. At this time, it coincided with the New Year's bonus, and the mine did not give flour or money, but issued six pieces of coal per person. The trend of coal coupon devaluation threatened every employee of Kailuan, and everyone was worried about how to spend the New Year. At this time, the Tangshan Party and government leading organs, with the funds of state trade organizations,职工和干部, formed the "Kailuan Tangshan Mine Employee Coal Store" (the situation of the other four mines was the same). They started by purchasing coal coupons and distributing food and daily necessities to workers, announcing to workers that they would buy coal coupons at prices higher than the market price and sell food and daily necessities at prices lower than the market price. The coal price was temporarily decided to be 220,000 yuan (60,000 yuan higher than the market price) plus eight catties of white flour (which was supplemented later) per ton of coal. This increased the value of coal coupons that were worth less than half a bag of flour to 30 catties of flour (equivalent to 0.7 bags or more). Because workers were eager to celebrate the New Year, it was impossible to recover all the coal coupons. At that time, it was decided that each person would only hand in one and a half tons, and the remainder would be collected at the end of the year. The unscrupulous merchants learned that the "public" was buying coal coupons, and they thought that the workers must buy food, so they raised the price of grain sharply, and the price of flour immediately rose from 450,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan. However, because the leading organs had made preparations in advance, they guaranteed to the workers that the flour, oil, and grain purchased before the price increase would still be sold at the price before the increase. Every time a worker took a coal coupon, they could exchange it for necessities, and some could exchange it for six or seven kinds of materials and still have money left over. Shortly after the New Year, with the help of employee coal, the remaining four and a half tons of coal from the New Year's bonus were recovered with a bolt of white cloth (equivalent to about three bags of flour) and one and a half bags of flour. The workers said even more gratefully: "Now it is really the world of the workers. The past government only knew how to exploit people, but the current government takes care of people everywhere."
    Since then, employee coal coupons have often been responsible for buying coal coupons and selling food and daily necessities to workers (actually playing the role of supply and marketing cooperatives. At that time, a call was issued to establish cooperatives, and more than 1,300 members have been developed so far). Its existence and development have dealt a serious blow to unscrupulous merchants. Under the policy of gradually increasing the price of coal coupons, in the past three months, the price of coal coupons that were worth less than half a bag of flour has been raised to the current 1.57 million yuan, equivalent to one bag of flour or more, and the difference from the actual price of coal is only 120,000 yuan. As a result, it has won the support of the majority of employees. According to a survey: the Kailuan Mining Bureau issued more than 60,000 tons of coal coupons (excluding New Year's red coal) for Tangshan Mine No. 1. The employee coal volume has now recovered more than 40,000 tons. Excluding the coal burned by the workers themselves, it can be said with certainty that very few have been bought by unscrupulous merchants.
    Due to the concentration of efforts to seize coal coupons and the insufficient funding conditions of the employee coal store, another measure was taken for flour coupons: on the one hand, the trade organization purchased them (sometimes also through the employee coal store); on the other hand, efforts were made to obtain flour from the Mining Bureau to be redeemed by employees first. As a result, it was stipulated that flour should not be redeemed for unscrupulous merchants or non-workers before a large amount of flour arrived. To ensure the implementation of this method, a deputy ticket was issued in addition to the issued flour ticket, indicating the employee number. The person redeeming the flour must hold both the original and deputy tickets and a photo. This forced some unscrupulous merchants to take out the flour tickets they had temporarily obtained for redemption. Workers who had sold flour tickets and obtained deputy tickets could take the opportunity to buy back a part. When workers bought them back, unscrupulous merchants tried to raise the price of flour tickets, but the trade organization sold them to workers at the original price (due to the reason of guaranteed cost of physical objects). Therefore, although the market price of flour is still 1.55 million yuan, the price of flour tickets is still stopped at around 600,000 yuan, which has dealt another painful blow to unscrupulous merchants holding a large number of flour tickets.
    First of all, employees should be organized immediately in the form of cooperatives. Although there was also a call to establish cooperatives here, and a share of four piculs of coal (one-quarter) was stipulated for each share, and more than 1,300 members were recruited. However, the development of the cooperative is very slow and its strength is very weak. So far, members only account for 10% of the employees. On the one hand, this is because the share price is set slightly high, but the main reason is that the coal coupon comrades are calling for the establishment of cooperatives independently, and the trade union has not given strong assistance, nor has it put it on the work agenda. Therefore, workers still only know that the "public" is solving problems for them, and many people do not know that there is a cooperative. Therefore, expanding the publicity of the benefits of cooperatives and mobilizing the majority of employees to join the cooperative should become one of the primary tasks of the current trade union and employee coal coupons.
    Secondly, most of the public trade organizations that can participate in this market competition now focus on purchasing coal, or only purchase coal, and flour is only a side business of the trade organization. This is very insufficient. In fact, flour tickets are not only sold by workers when flour supply is not available, but even if a large amount can be supplied, flour tickets still have a broad market, because not many miners can afford white flour. In the past, the flour issued after the start of work only passed through the hands of the miners and was transported to Pingjin by merchants. Regardless of the past or the present, flour (or flour tickets) occupies a major position in workers' wages. According to a survey in Tangshan Mine, the wage flour is about 20,000 bags per month (coal is more than 5,000 tons). The reason why only coal tickets were collected in the past and no flour tickets were collected, or a small number of flour tickets were collected, the lack of strength is certainly a problem, but the idea that some comrades believe that coal is easy to cash and flour cannot be obtained immediately is also an important factor. Therefore, how to organize forces and occupy the flour ticket position under the principle of benefiting factory flour workers still needs to be brought to the attention of the Tangshan leadership.
    Finally, at present, there are public organizations in Tangshan that purchase coal tickets, in addition to trade organizations and employee coal tickets, there are also the Pingjin Coal Ticket Department Office and Yumin Goods, etc. At present, these organizations urgently need to coordinate their actions, cooperate closely and divide the work specifically. Otherwise, either no one will collect them when they should be collected, or they will rush to buy them when they should not be collected. Any bias will leave loopholes for unscrupulous merchants. Not long ago, a certain organization collected ten tickets at a time, and fewer than ten tickets were not collected. Some people said that this was for "saving trouble," and some people said that it was for "buying more." Whether it is bureaucracy or profit-seeking, it objectively provides a convenience for vendors. Because workers do not have ten tickets, they cannot have direct contact with the purchasing organization, and they still have to hand them over to vendors. In particular, unscrupulous merchants have years of experience in the market. In the past, they boldly acted recklessly and arbitrarily exploited, but today they are definitely not willing to fail, and they are looking for our loopholes everywhere. Therefore, to defeat these unscrupulous merchants, we can only act in a unified manner and concentrate our strength.

    国家贸易机关向奸商斗争的经过
    急需解决的几个问题
    【本报讯】本报记者陆林，林里报导：唐山解放以来，国家贸易机关与职工会，正确执行了维护工人利益，打击奸商操枞该市煤票面票市场的方针，获得显著成绩。现就事实经过报导如下。
    煤票、面票，是开滦矿务局发给工人工资的一种支票，可以持票领取实物——煤和面。但在面粉不能及时供给，和穷困迫使工人不能不以面换粗米、以煤换吃食的情况下，工人便直接卖出煤、面或煤票、面票。于是大批奸商疯涌而起，收买煤面和支票，从中得利。在唐山解放前，及至旧的年关，矿工受奸商剥削之残酷、真是骇人听闻。那时，矿务局三个多月未发面粉，支票照旧发，结果，工人看了大批支票而挨饿。支票之多，仅以每人每月二袋面粉支票和半吨煤的支票合计，三个月中，唐山一矿的一万一千一百多工人，即积压面票六万六千六百袋，煤票一万六千六百五十吨。通常是“家无隔日粮”的矿工，只好将支票卖出以维持生活。这时，奸商便拚命把支票价格压低，甚至一日跌价十二次，当时面粉市价四十五万元（长币，合人民券四百五十元，下同），面票只卖八万元。通常能换二——三袋面粉的煤票，此刻只卖十六万元。就是说，奸商拿一袋面钱，可以买到值五袋多面的支票，工人们所有值二——三袋面粉的煤票，换不到半袋面。这时，又洽遇年关领取花红，矿方不给面粉，不给钱，每人发了六块煤，煤票贬价之风，威胁着开滦每一个职工，大家都为如何过年而担忧。这时，唐山党政领导机关，即以国家贸易机关的资金，职工和干部，组成了“开滦唐山矿职工煤栈”（其他四矿情况同），先后收购煤票，配给工人食粮日用品入手，向工人宣布，以高于市价的价格收买煤票，以低于市价的价格卖出食粮日用品。煤价决定暂以廿二万元（高出市价六万元）又八斤白面（是以后补给的）收煤一吨。这就使不值半袋面粉的煤票，一下提高到三十斤面粉（合○·七袋强）。因工人急于过年，全部收回煤票已不可能，当时决定每人只交一吨半，余者年末再收。奸商们得悉“公家”收买煤票的消息，以为工人一定要买食粮，于是猛抬粮价，面粉立时由四十五万涨到六十万元。但因领导机关事前就有准备，向工人保证在年前买的面、油、粮仍按未涨价前的价格销售。工人每拿一张煤票，便可换回必需品，有的换六七种物资还有钱。过年不久，贸易机关通过职工煤的帮助，又以一匹白布（约合三袋面粉）、一袋半面粉收回年关花红所余的四吨半煤。工人更感激的说：“现在可真是工人的天下了，过去的政府只知剥削人，现在的政府处处照顾人。”
    此后，职工煤票就经常担负了收买煤票，销售给工人食粮与日用品的任务（实际上起着供销合作社的作用，当时曾发出成立合作社的号召，至今已发展社员一千三百多）。它的存在与发展，给奸商们以严重打击。在使煤票价格逐渐提高的方针下，三个月来，已把不值半袋面粉的煤票提高到现在的一百五十七万元，合一袋多面粉，与煤的实价只差十二万元。因而取得了广大职工的拥护。据调查：矿务局发放出去的煤票（除年红煤外），唐山一矿为六万多吨，现职工煤量已收回四万多吨，除去工友们自己烧的，可以肯定的说，被奸商收买去的已经寥寥无几了。
    由于集中力量奋取煤票，加以职工煤栈资金条件的不足，对面票则采取了另一措施：一方面由贸易机关收购（有时也通过职工煤栈收）；另一方面向矿务局争取面粉首先给职工兑。结果规定在面粉不能大批到来之前，不准兑给奸商非工人。为保证这一办法实现，又规定在已发的面票之外，再发一副票，注明工牌号码，兑面人必须持有正副两票与像片。这就迫使一些奸商不得不把一时获得兑现的面票拿出来，已卖出面票又领到副票的工人，则可乘机买回一部。在工人回买中，奸商又企图把面票价格抬高，而贸易机关就以掌握在手的面票，原价（实物保本下的原因）卖给工人，所以至今面粉市价一百五十五万元，而面票仍旧停止在六十万元上下，使握有大批面票的奸商又受了痛击。
    首先，应立即用合作社的方式把职工组织起来。这里虽也曾号召成立合作社，并规定了每股股金四斛煤（四分之一），且吸收了一千三百多社员。但合作社的发展非常缓慢，力量也很单薄。至今社员仅占职工人员的百分之十，这一方面是由于股金订得稍高，但主要原因是煤票同志在号召单独组织合作社，职工会没有给以有力帮助，亦还没有把它放在工作日程上，因此工人至今只知道“公家”在为他们解决问题，很多人还不知道有了合作社。所以扩大宣传合作社的好处，动员广大职工入社，应成为目前职工会与职工煤票的首要任务之一。
    其次，现在所有能以参加这一市场争夺战的公营贸易机关，多以收煤为主、或专收煤，面只是贸易机关附带收贸。这是非常不够的。实际上，面票不止在面粉供应不上时工人出卖，即便能以大批供给，面票依然有它广阔的市场，因为吃得起白面的矿工还不多。过去开工发下的面粉，也只是经一经矿工的手，又为贩卖商运往平津。不论过去与现在，面粉（或面票）都占工人工资的主要地位。据唐山矿调查，工资面每月在两万袋左右（煤为五千余吨）。过去只收煤票而没有收面票，或少许收了些面票的原因，力量不足固然是个问题，但某些同志思想上认为煤易兑现，面不能立时到手，也确是一个重要因素。因此如何组织力量，在厂面工利益的原则下占领面票阵地，尚须提起唐山领导上的注意。
    最后，现在唐山收买煤票的公营机关，除贸易机关、职工煤票外，尚有平津煤票部办事处、裕民货等。目下，这些机关急需协同动作，密切配合与具体分工。否则，不是该收时候没人收，便是不该收时反而抢购。任何偏向都会给奸商留下空隙。不久前某机关收票一次十张，不够十张不收。这一事实有人说是为了“省事”，有人说是为了“多购”。不管是官僚主义、营利主义，客观上是给商贩一便利。因为工人没有十张票，不能和收购机关发生直接关系，他们还不得不交给商贩。尤其是奸商们有着多年对于市场的经验，过去他们大胆妄为，任意剥削，今天他们决不甘心失败，他们正在到处找我们的空子。因此，要取胜这些奸商，惟有我们统一行动，集中力量。
