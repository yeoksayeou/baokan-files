    Fourth Day of the National Youth Congress
    Comrade Zhou Enlai Attends and Reports
    Twelve Youth Representatives Recount Their Struggle Stories
    [Report from this newspaper] The first representative assembly of the All-China Youth held its fourth day of meetings. In the morning, the assembly was devoted to speeches. Twelve representatives—workers, soldiers, farmers, students, writers, vocational educators, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese—reported on their arduous struggles, heroic deeds, and serious work. In the afternoon, Comrade Zhou Enlai, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported on "Unite the Youth of the Nation, Advance Under the Banner of Mao Zedong."
    He Yuzhen, a female worker who led the major strike at the Shanghai No. 9 Xin Xin Cotton Mill during the February 2nd Incident, tragically recounted how the cotton mill workers steadfastly resisted the fully armed attacks of the Kuomintang reactionaries. One worker even personally drove a large truck to block an armored vehicle attempting to break through the main gate. She excitedly said, "Shanghai is about to be liberated, and the time has come to settle our blood debts!" Fan Yong, driver of the Northeast Train No. 3005, recounted how fifteen young railway workers, braving the danger of Kuomintang plane bombings, fully utilized their courage and wisdom to conceal the train and finally transport thirty-seven cars of ammunition to the front lines of the fierce battle. Liu Kuiji, a combat hero of the East China Field Army, reported on the heroic deeds of the Jinan Heroic Company and said, "In order to liberate all of China, we must also strive for a 'Guangdong Heroic Company' and a 'Taiwan Heroic Company.'" The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. Geng Xin, a youth who participated in the Taiwan February 28th Revolution, spoke about the revolutionary spirit of the youth in Taiwan. Li Duqing, who persisted in armed struggle on Hainan Island for ten years, said in his report that the people of Taiwan and South China would do everything possible to welcome and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in liberating South China and Taiwan. Luo Yangshen, a representative of overseas Chinese youth, stated in his speech that overseas Chinese youth increasingly support the Chinese Communist Party. Zhang Ping, a representative from Kunming, recounted the tragic July 15th Massacre in Kunming last year. Keli Ge, a youth representative from Inner Mongolia, happily recounted the heroic achievements of the Inner Mongolian cavalry in combating the Kuomintang army and the close relationship between the Mongolian and Han peoples under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    In addition, Mr. Sun Qimeng, a representative of vocational youth, reported on the learning problems of vocational youth, farmer representative Kong Linglun reported on the support-the-front movement, and Ma Feng, author of *Heroes of Lüliang*, recounted his writing process. Following this, four committees were elected and promoted for the examination of elections, proposals, the report on the basic tasks of Chinese youth, and the review of the congress charter.
    [Another dispatch] Two youth representatives from the recently uprising warship "Chongqing" also attended the congress, and all the youth representatives welcomed them with applause.
