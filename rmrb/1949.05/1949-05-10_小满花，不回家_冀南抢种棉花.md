    Southern Hebei Rushes to Plant Cotton
    [Jinan Electric Dispatch] Under the active promotion and leadership of party and government cadres at all levels, farmers in various parts of southern Hebei are gradually overcoming the idea of relying on heaven for rain. Under different circumstances, they are adopting different methods to fight against the spring drought by rushing to plant and sow seeds. Ningnan County is located in the lower reaches of the Puyang River system, and the terrain is uneven. In the past, there was no habit of watering the land. This spring, under the leadership of cadres at all levels, the entire county is unified in using river water to irrigate the land for planting. To prevent disputes, village cadres formed irrigation committees to provide unified leadership. Within half a month, 16,687 mu of land along the Puyang and Feng Rivers were irrigated, and 90 percent has already been planted. Farmers in the Nanguan Street of Xiajin Urban Area voluntarily formed six mutual aid groups to carry water and plant seeds. The Jiang Peng group, consisting of twelve households, stipulated that each household should first plant two mu of cotton, then take turns in order until the planting plan is completed. The group members cooperated and completed the planting of four mu in one day. Within three days, nearly a hundred mu have been planted in this street. Women and children in Huangtai Village, Weixian County, mobilized. Ma Xiu Kui led his family to the fields. He carried water, his wife dug holes, his daughter watered, and his son sowed seeds. Soon, they planted two mu of cotton. Seeing that his method was good, people in the village followed his example. Lingshui Slope Village in Linqing has been flooded for years. Under the slogan of "early planting can yield a harvest," they took advantage of the village's sticky soil and shallow underground veins to repair three soil wells and break forty wells to carry water and plant seeds. In the village of five hundred households, one hundred and thirty mu of cotton have already been planted. Ma Jinming, the party branch secretary of Wuxun Zhao Ziying Village, accepted the experience of spring drought planting from previous years, first conducted his own successful experiment and then promoted it, that is, tying a tile to the plow leg during sowing so that the dry soil could be separated on both sides, and the seeds could be placed on the moist soil. Under this influence, the farmers in the village were in high spirits and unanimously proposed that the sowing task could be completed within three days. Zhengyuansi in Baixiang launched a cotton planting competition. The farmers' experience: "Two plows of flowers at the Beginning of Summer, and no returning home at Little Fullness." They have proposed to complete the planting plan before the Beginning of Summer. Now all the waterwheels and windlasses are running day and night, irrigating and sowing as they go.

    冀南抢种棉花
    【冀南电】冀南各地农民在各级党政干部积极推动领导下，农民逐渐克服靠天等雨思想，在不同的情况下，采取不同方法突击抢种点种向春旱作斗争。宁南县处在滏阳河系各河下游，地势不平，以往没有浇地习惯，今春在各级干部领导下，全县统一利用河水浇地播种。为防止纠纷，各村干部组成浇地委员会，统一领导。半月的时间内，滏阳、沣河两岸共浇地一六六八七亩，百分之九十已经播种。夏津城区南关街农民自愿结合组成六个互助组担水点种。姜鹏组十二户，规定每户先点二亩棉花，再依次轮流直到完成种植计划为止，组员分工合作，一天即点种四亩。三天内该街已点种近百亩。威县黄台村妇女儿童总动员，马修奎带领全家下地，他担水，妻子刨坑，女孩浇水，男孩下种，很快点了二亩棉花。村中看他的办法好，纷纷向他学习。临清水坡村连年被淹，在“早种能收”的口号下，利用该村土质粘性和地脉浅的有利条件，修整土井三眼，破井四十眼，担水点种。在五百户的村庄上，已点种棉花一百三十亩。武训赵子营村支书马金明接受往年春旱播种经验，自己先行试验成功然后推广，即播种时把耧腿上绑个瓦，这样可把干土分在两旁，种籽下到湿土上。在此影响下，该村农民情绪很高，一致提出三天内即可完成播种任务。柏乡正元寺展开植棉竞赛，农民的经验：“立夏二耧花、小满花不归家。”纷纷提出要在立夏前完成播种计划，现所有的水车、辘轳昼夜不停，随浇随下种。
