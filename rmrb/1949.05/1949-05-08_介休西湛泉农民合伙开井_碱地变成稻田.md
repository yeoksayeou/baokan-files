    Jiexiu Xizhanquan Farmers Cooperatively Dig Wells
    Alkaline Land Transformed into Paddy Fields
    [Jinzhong News] Xizhanquan Village in Jiexiu has a low-lying, damp terrain. The residual water from all the major springs in Jiexiu County passes through this area. Over the years, this has caused all 1,128 mu of land in Xizhanquan to become alkaline. The "alkaline wasteland" that could not be cultivated: 480 mu were either raw or hardened alkaline land. The remaining land was irrigated by "bamboo and wooden tube foreign wells" dug by the masses over the years, and rice was planted. The village formerly had 49 foreign wells, but due to destruction and trampling by Japanese devils and Yan Xishan's bandit troops over the years, only eleven wells were usable before liberation last year. "However, the alkaline wasteland can definitely be completely transformed into paddy fields!" Village Farmers' Association member Comrade Liu Quanxin told me confidently. After the land reform last winter, the poor peasants were emancipated, and this spring their enthusiasm for production increased. Everyone mobilized to dig foreign wells. The Farmers' Association called for well-digging. The emancipated households of Liu Quanfu, Ren Shiyan, Ren Peixian, Liu Guangyuan, and others first signed up to cooperatively dig a foreign well. Work began on March 5th. Nine people worked together for ten days, and it was completed on the 14th. The depth was ten zhang, and the water output was very strong, enough to supply water for 17 mu of paddy fields.
    From March 5th to April 10th, a total of 68 households participated in well-digging, and four wells were smoothly completed. Another production committee member, Li Keqian, said: "By the time of rice transplanting at the end of May, we will strive to dig eight 'bamboo and wooden tube foreign wells.' Each well will supply water for 17 mu of paddy fields, which will eliminate 136 mu of cultivated alkaline land (accounting for more than 60 percent of the 240 mu of all cultivated alkaline land). Each mu of new rice will yield 300 jin of net rice, which can increase rice production by 40,800 jin. As for the raw alkaline land, we are not worried. The democratic government lends three shi of rice for each foreign well dug. In less than three years, we guarantee that they will all grow lush green rice seedlings."

    介休西湛泉农民合伙开井
    碱地变成稻田
    【晋中讯】介休西湛泉村地形低凹湿潮，介休全县所有大泉的余水，都由这一带经过，年深日久，遂使西湛泉一千一百二十八亩土地，全部变为碱地。不能种植的“碱荒地”：生、热两种共有四百八十亩。其余土地，则凭借群众历年开凿的“竹木筒洋井”灌溉，种着稻子。该村从前共有洋井四十九眼，历年来经鬼子和阎锡山匪军破坏、蹧踏，到去年解放前，出水能用的井仅剩下十一眼。“不过，碱荒地是一定能全部变为稻田的！”该村农协会委员刘泉信同志这样自信地告诉我。去冬土地改革后，贫苦农民翻了身，今春生产劲头大了，大家就发动凿洋井，由农协会号召凿井，翻身户刘全福、任时严、任裴先、刘广元等七家首先报名伙凿洋井一眼，三月五日开工，九个人共凿了十天，十四号就完工，深度十丈，出水甚旺，能供十七亩稻田用水。
    这样从三月五号到四月十号，全村前后参加凿井的共六十八户，四眼井，一帆风顺地便凿成了。另一个生产委员李克谦说：“赶五月底稻子插秧时节，我们争取凿好八眼‘竹木筒洋井’，每眼供十七亩稻田用水，就能消灭熟荒碱地一百三十六亩（占全部熟荒二百四十亩的百分之六十强），新稻每亩以净米三百斤计，能增产稻米四万零八千斤。至于生荒，我们也不发愁，民主政府每凿一眼洋井贷米三石，不出三年，管保教他们都长出绿油油的稻秧来。”
