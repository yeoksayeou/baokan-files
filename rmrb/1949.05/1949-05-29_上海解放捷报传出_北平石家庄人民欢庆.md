　　Shanghai Liberation Victory Reported
　　Beiping and Shijiazhuang People Celebrate

　　[Our Newspaper] The news of the complete liberation of Shanghai, China's largest city, has been met with jubilation and excitement among all strata of society in Beiping. Our reporter interviewed workers and industrial capitalists in Beiping.

　　Zhang Rongrui, a worker at the Telecommunications Bureau, said: "The liberation of Shanghai means we have seized the old nest of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families. The factories that these four families seized for so many years have now returned to the hands of the working class and the broad masses of people." Chen Jiuzhang said: "Shanghai was the largest stronghold of American imperialism in China, and now the People's Liberation Army has taken it back." Worker Hu Tong told the reporter: "This time, the reactionaries carried out all kinds of sabotage, and the factories must have suffered losses. The worker brothers in Shanghai must work hard to restore production, and the worker brothers in Beiping must also strengthen production to support the resumption of work of the worker brothers in Shanghai."

　　Zhang Guifu, a worker at the North China Electric Power Company, said: "After the liberation of Shanghai, the exchange of goods between the North and the South will allow Beiping to develop industrial production even further."

　　Pu Jiexiu, manager of Zhenbei Tannery, said: "After the liberation of Shanghai, the exchange of goods between the North and the South can be carried out smoothly. Shanghai has developed industry and excellent technology, and the cost of some industrial products is lower than in the North, which may stimulate industrial production in the North." Sun Fuling, manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, believes that: "A large amount of Chinese idle capital is concentrated in Shanghai. If this private capital is invested in industrial production, it will be very helpful for building a new democratic economy. Based on the situation in Beiping and Tianjin, we deeply know that developing industrial production is our most important task. National capitalists with a little foresight will also use their capital to develop industrial production, and will no longer engage in speculative commercial transactions."

　　[Shijiazhuang Electric Dispatch] The news of the liberation of Shanghai, China's largest city, has caused jubilation and excitement throughout the city. Workers, students, and citizens are rushing to buy special editions or telling each other the news, and some are happily performing Yangko dances. The workers in each factory unanimously stated: "We will do a good job in our production competition to celebrate the liberation of Shanghai." The workers of the furnace plant decided to repair the two bridges exceeding the task, named "Shanghai Liberation," and guarantee to complete them before the 30th. When the workers were discussing this news, they were very concerned about the worker brothers in Shanghai, admired their heroic struggle against the reactionaries, and congratulated them on gaining freedom and liberation today.

　　上海解放捷报传出
  　北平石家庄人民欢庆
    【本报讯】中国第一大都市--上海完全解放的消息传到北平后，各阶层无不欢腾鼓舞。记者特访问了平市工人与工业资本家。
    电信局工人张容瑞说：上海解放，获取了蒋宋孔陈四大家族的老窝。四大家族夺去了多年的工厂，又回到了工人阶级和广大人民手里。陈九章说：上海是美帝国主义在中国势力最大的根据地，现在解放军把它夺回来了。工人胡桐对记者说：这次反动派进行了各种破坏，工厂一定有损失，上海的工人弟兄一定要努力恢复生产，北平的工人弟兄也要以加强生产来支援上海工人弟兄的复工。
    华北电业公司工人张贵福说：上海解放后，南北物资交流，北平更可以发展工业生产了。
    振北制革公司经理浦洁修说：上海解放后，南北物资得以顺畅交流。上海工业发达，技术精良，有些工业品的成本较北方低，这可能刺激北方的工业生产。福兴面粉厂经理孙福凌认为：中国的大批游资多汇集于上海，如果这批私人资本，投放在工业生产上，对于建设新民主主义经济很有帮助。根据平津情况，我们深深的知道发展工业生产是我们最重要的任务。稍具有眼光的民族资本家，也一定会把他们的资本用于发展工业生产方面，不致再从事于投机倒把的商业买卖。
    【石家庄电】中国第一大都市上海解放的消息传来，引起全市欢欣鼓舞。工人、学生、市民争购号外或奔走相告，有的高兴得扭起秧歌。各厂工人们一致表示：“把我们的生产竞赛搞好，来庆祝上海解放。”制炉所的工人决定要把两孔超过任务的桥梁修好，命名“上海解放号”，保证在三十日以前完成。工人们在谈论这个消息时，很关心上海的工人弟兄，敬佩他们英勇地同反动派的斗争，并祝贺他们今天获得了自由解放。
