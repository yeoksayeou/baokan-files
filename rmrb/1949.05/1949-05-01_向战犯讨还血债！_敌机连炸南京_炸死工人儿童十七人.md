On the morning of the 28th, two enemy bombers dropped more than a dozen bombs in Xiaguan and other places, attempting to destroy the Nanjing Water and Electricity Company and cut off the water and electricity supply for more than one million citizens, killing fifteen children and two steel mill workers, and wounding more than twenty children, workers, and citizens.
