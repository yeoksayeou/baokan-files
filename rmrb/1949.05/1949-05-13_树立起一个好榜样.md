　　Setting a Good Example

　　Under the enthusiastic and widespread production competition of more than 100,000 workers and staff members, the forty mines affiliated with the nine major state-owned coal mining areas in Northeast China have gloriously completed and exceeded the coal mining plan for the first quarter of this year! The amount of coal mined exceeded the plan by 6 percent, and the amount transported exceeded the plan by 7 percent. Due to the increase in coal mining and the improvement in quality, a solid foundation has been laid for supporting the national liberation war, developing Northeast industry, and further improving people's lives.

　　The increase in coal mining is actually due to the improvement of coal mining methods. Now, the responsible comrades of the industrial departments in Northeast China are calling for the creation of Stakhanovite-style labor heroes in Northeast China, which will surely set a good example for workers and staff members throughout the country!

    树立起一个好榜样
    东北九大国营煤矿区所属的四十处矿山，在十余万职工热情的普遍的生产竞赛之下，已经光荣地完成并且超过了今年第一季的采煤计划！在采掘量方面计超过了百分之六，在运输量方面超过了百分之七。由于采煤量的增加以及质的提高，使支援全国解放战争及发展东北工业和人民生活的进一步改善，获得了坚实的基础。
    采煤量的提高，实由于采煤方法的改进，现在东北的工业部门负责同志又号召创造斯达哈诺夫式的东北劳动英雄，必能给全国各地的职工树立起一个好榜样！
