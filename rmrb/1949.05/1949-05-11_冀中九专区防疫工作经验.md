Experiences in Epidemic Prevention in the Ninth Administrative Region of Central Hebei

Organization of Rescue and Epidemic Prevention

The counties under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Administrative Region have all established rescue teams, with the director of the Medical Association serving concurrently as the captain. The teams are divided into several groups, each with a leader, pharmacist, and statistician. The organization of the groups is based on the principle of combining Chinese and Western medicine with varying levels of technical skill. When An'guo City was bombed by Kuomintang planes, a rapid rescue team was organized for timely treatment. In this structure, each person had a vehicle. Another type of organization involves rescue teams that prepare everything in advance to prevent rapidly occurring emergencies.

Disease Situation

From last spring to the present, the common prevalent diseases have included: measles, dysentery, smallpox, cholera, pneumonia, meningitis, influenza, relapsing fever, typhoid fever, purpura, boils, and more than ten other types. There were a total of 853 villages with disease outbreaks, accounting for more than 24% of the total number of villages in the region. The number of patients was 48,859, with 3,866 deaths. We cured 44,173 patients, of which measles accounted for 60% of the total number of patients, dysentery accounted for 30%, and others accounted for 10%.

Preparations Before Rescue

First, based on the size of the disease-stricken area and the prevalence of the epidemic, determine the number of rescue personnel to prevent waste of manpower and expenses, or the phenomenon of failing to quickly extinguish the outbreak. In addition, after obtaining accurate information about the disease, quickly mobilize doctors and send people to the affected area for detailed investigation. After the doctors are assembled and the investigators have returned, study treatment methods based on the type of disease and the medicines to be brought, and then set off. Before departure, it is best for the leaders to mobilize the doctors to encourage their enthusiasm. Some local authorities adopt a send-off ceremony to boost the morale of the doctors, which is very good. In order to solve problems in a timely manner, it is best to have cadres go to the place where the disease is occurring.

How to Carry Out Work in Epidemic Areas

First, it is necessary to contact local cadres and the Medical Association, and to study treatment methods with local doctors, absorbing their treatment experience before the arrival of the rescue team. Then, incorporate them into the rescue team's groups to jointly carry out rescue work. However, in terms of treatment methods, a village-by-village, street-by-street approach should be adopted, dispersing the rescue groups. After registration, either conduct collective diagnosis or dispersed diagnosis. Some villages temporarily set up treatment sheds on the streets. These methods can be used flexibly depending on the type and severity of the disease. In addition, during treatment, try to use the evening time to collectively gather information, review treatment progress, share experiences, and plan the work for the next day.

Regarding the issue of collecting medicine fees, village cadres should be informed in advance that fees will be charged uniformly. Here, it is necessary to prevent the paternalistic views of village cadres. It is not necessary to mention collecting medicine fees at the time of treatment, because if the masses hear that seeing a doctor and taking medicine costs money, it will affect their enthusiasm for treatment. They should be asked to pay only after they recover, which they will do more willingly. In the end, discuss and calculate the medicine fees with the village cadres. Those who are truly poor and cannot afford to pay can be exempted. But note: the words "reduce" and "exempt" should not be used.

Publicity Work

Set up publicity sheds, combined with cultural publicity sheds or single health publicity sheds, with doctors on duty according to the time, or conduct mobile publicity, and hang up physiological hygiene posters, etc. This method is most suitable in areas with concentrated populations such as temple fairs and market towns. In addition, check small stalls and vendors selling snacks for unsanitary conditions. During temple fairs, call on all merchants to clean the streets. This was done very well at the temple fair in An'guo County, and very few people got sick. During the Raoyang temple fair, because the merchants were not called upon to pay attention to hygiene, 41 people became seriously ill and more than 100 people had mild illnesses at the Zhoucun temple fair. The entire region used temple fairs for publicity in a total of 28 places, and the results were generally good.

    冀中九专区防疫工作经验
    救护防疫的组织
    九专区所属各县，均已成立了救护队，由医联会主任兼队长，下设若干小组，内设组长、司药、统计各一人，小组的组织是根据中、西医生与技术高低相结合的精神来划分的。安国市遭国民党飞机轰炸时，为了救治及时，曾组织了快速救护队。在小组内，每人一辆车子。另外一种组织是救护队平时即准备好一切东西，以防迅速到来的紧急事件。
    疾病情况
    从去年春到现在通常流行的几种病有：麻疹、赤痢、天花、霍乱、肺炎、脑膜炎、流行感冒、回归热、伤寒、紫斑疔等十余种。发生病疫的村庄共八百五十三处，占全专区总村数的百分之二十四强。患病人数四万八千八百五十九人，死亡三千八百六十六人，经我们治愈者四万四千一百七十三人，其中麻疹占病人总数的百分之六十，赤痢占百分之三十，其他占百分之十。
    救护前的准备工作
    首先根据罹病地区之大小，流行状况，确定前去救护人员之多少，防止浪费人力和开支，或不能迅速扑灭的现象。另外，得到病的确实情况后，一面迅速调动医生，一面派人到发病地区进行详细调查，待医生集合齐了，下去调查的人也回来了，便可依据病的种类研究治疗办法，以及应带去的药品等，随即出发。在出发前，最好由首长对医生进行动员，以鼓励他们的情绪；有的地方机关采取欢送方式，鼓舞了医生的情绪，这是很好的。为了能及时解决问题，最好有干部一齐到发病的地方去。
    到流行病地区如何开展工作
    首先应当同当地的干部及医联会取得联系，并和当地医生研究治疗的办法，吸取他们在救护队未来前的治疗经验，然后把他们也编入救护队的小组内，共同进行救治工作。但在治疗方法上，应采取分村、分街的进行，把救护小组分散开，等到登记后，或集体诊断或分散诊断，有的村临时在街上搭了治疗棚。这些方法可根据病的种类及轻重灵活使用。此外，在治疗中应尽量抽出晚上的时间来进行集体汇集情况，检讨治疗情况和介绍经验，并计划出第二天的工作。
    在收药费问题上，可预先对村干说明一律收费。在这里应当防止村干部的恩赐观点。在治疗中，不须说当时即收药费。因为群众一听说看病吃药需花钱，就影响了他们对治病的积极性，应待最后病人好了，再叫他拿钱，他却痛快的多。到最后同村干部一块商讨算药费，确实贫苦交不起的也就算了。但要注意：不应说出减和免的字眼来。
    宣传工作
    搭宣传棚，结合文化宣传棚或单搭卫生宣传棚，由医生按时间值班，或进行游动宣传，悬挂生理卫生挂图等。这种方式在庙会、集镇等人口集中地区最为适宜。另外检查小摊及卖零食的是否有不卫生的地方。在庙会时，则号召各商户打扫街道。在安国县庙会上作的很好，很少有人生病。饶阳庙会时，由于没有号召商户讲卫生，结果在周村庙会上得重病的四十一人，轻的百余人。全专区利用庙会做宣传，共二十八处，成绩都还好。
