　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd. A unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, on the 18th and 19th, successively captured the important station of Tingsiqiao and the city of Xianning to its northeast on the Yuehan Railway, annihilating four regiments of the 309th Division of the 127th Army of the enemy, and an engineer platoon of the 58th Army, capturing more than a thousand enemy soldiers. Note: Tingsiqiao and Heshengqiao, which were captured by the People's Liberation Army on the 17th, are both important military locations. During the Northern Expedition War in 1926, the Independent Regiment of the 4th Army of the Northern Expeditionary Army, under the leadership of Communist Party member General Ye Ting, defeated the army of warlord Wu Peifu in the above two locations. When the Bai Chongxi bandit army fled south this time, it wantonly destroyed the railway bridges and other facilities along the line, and robbed all the grain and grass of the residents in the area more than a hundred miles south of Heshengqiao, but still could not stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army.

　　粤汉路上我军连捷
  　克汀泗桥军事重地
  　解放咸宁歼敌四个团
    【新华社汉口二十二日电】人民解放军第四野战军一部，十八、十九两日，先后攻占粤汉路上的重要车站汀泗桥及其东北的咸宁城，歼敌一二七军三零九师之四个团，及五十八军之一个工兵排，共俘敌千余名。按：汀泗桥及十七日已为解放军攻占的贺胜桥，均为军事要地。一九二六年北伐战争时，北伐军第四军独立团，在共产党员叶挺将军的领导下，曾于上述两地大败军阀吴佩孚的军队。此次白崇禧匪军南逃时，曾大肆破坏沿线铁路桥梁等设备，并将贺胜桥以南百余里地区居民的粮草全部抢光，但仍无法阻止解放军的胜利前进。
