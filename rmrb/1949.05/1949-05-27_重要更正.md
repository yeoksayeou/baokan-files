　　Important Correction
    The "Provisional Measures for Monopoly and Taxation of Liquor in North China," promulgated by the North China People's Government, was published in the People's Daily on May 24th. In Article 11 of Chapter 3 of the Measures, the tax calculation formula "Average Wholesale Price × (1 + Tax Rate) = Taxable Price" was a transcription error and should be corrected to "Average Wholesale Price ÷ (1 + Tax Rate) = Taxable Price." We hereby make this correction.
  　May 26th
    Also: In yesterday's Economic Special Edition on page 4, the phrase "bureaucratic capitalism's triple oppression" in the 46th line of the fifth column of "The Rebirth of Industry and Commerce in Beijing and Tianjin" was misplaced due to a layout error during the page change. It should be placed at the end of the fourth column, following the sentence "still imperialism, feudalism, and". In addition to strictly enforcing discipline, we extend our apologies to the readers and the author of the article.

　　重要更正
    华北人民政府颁布之华北酒类专卖暨征税暂行办法，已载五月二十四日人民日报。该办法第三章第十一条征税计算公式平均批价×（１＋税率）＝完税价格，系抄录错误，应更正为平均批价÷（１＋税率）＝完税价格。特此更正。
  　五月二十六日
    又：本报昨日第四版经济专刊“平津工商业的新生”第五栏第四十六行“官僚资本主义的三重压迫，”因改版排错，应排在第四栏最末一行“还是帝国主义、封建主义和”一句后面。除严格执行纪律外，特向读者及该文作者致歉。
