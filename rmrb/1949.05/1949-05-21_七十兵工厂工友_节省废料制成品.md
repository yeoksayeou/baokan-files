(Ping City News) The Machine Shop of the 70th Ordnance Factory is saving labor and materials and utilizing waste in production. Comrade Liu Fusheng, after inventing the milling cutter, continued to use scientific methods to join drill bits. In the past, a 25-meter drill bit, worth ten thousand yuan, would have to be scrapped after only a few days of use, which was a great pity. Now, it is lengthened and its steel properties are maintained, so it can be used as five new ones. Also, the copper washers made by the department, due to the lack of copper and its particularly high price, Zhang Guosheng carefully retained the copper turned down and stored it for recasting, which is estimated to save one-half of the material. In addition, the waste iron heads cut off were collected into piles for use. Comrade Xu Shaopeng and others from the stamping department made positioning rings, although each section is only two or three inches long, they are just right for use, saving both labor and materials. (Chen Han)

(Another dispatch) Men Ziming, a fitter in the stamping department of the First Division of the 70th Ordnance Factory, has been making hanging clasps since May. Originally, the bend of the hanging clasp was made by clamping it with large pliers and repeatedly twisting two large steel bars, which took a long time to make one, and the efficiency was slow, and the produced items were not standardized. In order to improve this practice, he studied for a whole day and finally created a new hanging clasp bending tool. The efficiency of this tool exceeds the previous method by three times, and it can guarantee the quality and standardization of finished products. (Ren Yingjun)

　　七十兵工厂工友
  　节省废料制成品
    【平市讯】七十兵工厂机工部在生产中节工省料利用废物。刘福生同志在发明铣刀后，又继用科学方法接钻头，过去价值万元一只的二十五米钻头，用不了几日就得报废，非常可惜，现将它接长，且保钢性不变，可当五个新的使用。又该部所作紫铜垫，因紫铜缺乏，及价目特贵，张国生将车下的紫铜加意保留，储存再铸，预计可省料二分之一。又将截下废铁头，搜积成堆以备使用。冲压部徐绍彭同志等作定位圈，虽然每段才两三寸长，而用起来正合适，省工又省料。　（陈汉）
    【又讯】七十兵工厂第一所冲压部钳工门子铭从五月份担任做挂攀，因原先挂攀的弯度是用大钳子夹着两根大钢棍，反复绞驳，费很长时间才能做出一个，效率既慢，生产的东西也不规律化。他为了改善这种做法，经一整天研究，终于创造出一套新的挂攀折曲具。这个工具的效能超过以往三倍，并能保证成品品质规律化（任英俊）
