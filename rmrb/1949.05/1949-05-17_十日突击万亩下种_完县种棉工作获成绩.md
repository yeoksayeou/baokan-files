　　Ten-Day Blitz Seeds Ten Thousand Mu
  　Wan County Achieves Success in Cotton Planting

    [Chahar News] Wan County's ten-day cotton planting blitz (from April 28th to May 3rd) has achieved significant results. According to statistics from four districts, 10,050 mu have been planted. Districts five and six purchased an additional twenty-six waterwheels, repaired nine, dug three brick wells, and dug one hundred and fourteen earthen wells, and repaired twenty-nine. These achievements are mainly due to the concentrated leadership of the county and districts, with fifty county cadres assigned to key districts to assist. Furthermore, the work was proactive. For example, the West Small District of District Six convened a meeting of key village cadres before the blitz to study specific measures. Thirdly, production stimulated production. Cadres personally helping the villagers with planting played a significant role. The County Committee has inspected and summarized these achievements and decided to continue the blitz for another seven days (from the 8th to the 15th) on the existing foundation. The County Committee also proposed: use a work style of following through to the end to resolutely complete the entire cotton planting plan.

　　十日突击万亩下种
  　完县种棉工作获成绩
    【察哈尔讯】完县的十日点种棉花突击旬（从四月二十八至五月三日），已获得重大成绩，按四个区的统计，完成点种一万零五十亩。五、六两个区，增买水车二十六辆，修理九辆，打砖井三眼，挖土井一百一十四眼，修理二十九眼。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于县区领导的力量集中，县里有五十个干部配备到重点区帮助。再就是工作争取了主动。如六区西小区在突击旬前，就召开了村主要干部会议，研究具体办法。第三是以生产带动了生产。干部亲自帮助老乡点种，起作用很大。县委会检查总结了这些成绩，决定在现有基础上，再继续突击七天（从八日到十五日止）。县委并提出：用一竿子扎到底的工作作风，坚决完成整个种棉计划。
