Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 7th: According to a Moscow radio broadcast, the May 2nd issue of the Communist Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" magazine, published an article entitled "The Greatest Victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" commenting on the liberation of Nanjing:

    On the night of April 23rd, units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army occupied Nanjing. The crossing of the Yangtze River on a broad front and the liberation of Nanjing are the greatest victories of the Chinese democratic forces in the entire process of the civil war, a civil war imposed on the Chinese people by foreign imperialists and their agents, the feudal warlords, and the comprador bourgeoisie. Undoubtedly, this victory will have a decisive significance in establishing peace and democracy in China.

    The military failure of the Chinese reactionaries not only demonstrates the bankruptcy of the corrupt system but also represents the failure of the masters of the Chinese reactionaries - American imperialism. American money and American fighter planes cannot save the reactionaries. During the offensive last September, the People's Liberation Army eliminated one-third of Chiang Kai-shek's forces, and these forces were the most elite. The population of the liberated areas is already over 200 million. In the past two years, the result of the People's Liberation Army eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's main force has reduced his forces from 4.3 million to 1.1 million combat troops and 90,000 logistics personnel, while the People's Liberation Army has increased from 1 million to 3 million. This is a fatal blow to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime and its clique.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has strived to establish a democratic system in China by peaceful means. To this end, the Chinese Communist Party put forward eight conditions, on the basis of which a peaceful solution could be reached. The Chinese Communist Party agreed to hold peace talks with the Nanjing Kuomintang government, but events proved that the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to use the peace talks to gain a breathing space in order to make new attempts to reorganize counter-revolutionary forces.

    The peace terms proposed by the Chinese Communist Party were rejected by the Kuomintang government. At midnight on April 20th, the People's Liberation Army began the Yangtze River Campaign. After three days of fighting, Nanjing was occupied. The Liberation Army defeated twelve enemy divisions. On April 24th, Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, was occupied. According to recent news reports, the People's Liberation Army is victoriously advancing on all fronts to liberate all of China.

    评论解放南京巨大意义
    蒋介石反动集团已遭受致命打击
    【新华社北平七日电】据莫斯科电台广播，五月二日出版的共产党情报局机关报“争取持久和平与人民民主”杂志，以“中国人民解放军的最大胜利”为题评论南京的解放称：
    四月二十三日深夜中国人民解放军部队占领了南京。在广大战线上强渡长江及解放南京，是中国民主力量在内战整个进程中的最大胜利，这种内战是外国帝国主义者及其代理人封建军阀及大买办资产阶级强加于中国人民的。无疑的，这一胜利对于在中国奠定和平与民主将有决定的意义。
    中国反动派在军事上的失败，不仅说明腐朽制度的破产，同时也表示中国反动派的主人——美帝国主义的失败。美国的金元和美国的驱逐机并不能挽救反动派。在去年九月的进攻中，人民解放军消灭了蒋介石三分之一的兵力，并且这些兵力是最精锐的，解放区的人口已经是在两万万人以上。在过去的两年过程中，人民解放军消灭了蒋介石主力军的结果，使他的兵力由四百三十万人减少到一百一十万人的作战部队，和九万人的后勤人员，而人民解放军则从一百万增加到了三百万人。这是蒋介石反动政权及其集团遭受的致命打击。
    中国人民解放军曾经力求以和平方法求得在中国树立民主制度，为此目的，中国共产党提出了八项条件，在这八项条件的基础上是会达到和平解决的。中国共产党同意与南京国民党政府进行和平谈判，可是事变证明，国民党反动分子企图利用和平谈判而得到喘息时间，以便做改编反革命力量的新企图。
    中国共产党提出的和平条件，为国民党政府拒绝了，四月二十日半夜人民解放军开始了长江战役，三天作战之后，占领了南京，解放军打垮了敌人的十二个师，四月二十四日占领了山西省会太原，根据最近消息报道：人民解放军为解放全中国，在各战线上均在胜利地向前发展着。
