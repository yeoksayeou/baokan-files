Synopsis of the Story "Bridge"

　　From January 1947, the war situation in the Northeast entered a new stage: In the first four months of this year, the People's Liberation Army stopped the strategic offensive of the Kuomintang bandit army in the Northeast, and after May, our army turned to a full-scale offensive. This change in the war situation put forward new tasks for the supply and transportation work in the rear of the Liberated Areas, requiring the rapid restoration of railway transportation.

　　The Minister of the Engineering Department of the Railway Bureau came to the railway factory and explained to the factory director that the Songhua River Railway Bridge must be repaired within a month, and the railway factory should produce all the required bridge seats and rivets within half a month. The factory director accepted this task. When discussing with the chief engineer how to complete it, the chief engineer believed that the factory had no steel, the steel-making furnace had not been repaired, and the time was so pressing that the task was impossible to complete. He shook his head and said: "Even if there are materials, it will take at least four months!"

　　The difficulties mentioned by the engineer are all facts, but the task is urgent and must be completed. At this time, instead of emphasizing the difficulties and exaggerating the difficulties, we should try to overcome them. The basic way to overcome difficulties lies in mobilizing all workers and staff to use their brains and hands. The chief engineer is an old scientific and technical personnel. He has never seen or understood the power of the masses. Other staff members and many workers also lacked confidence. However, after mobilization among party members and activists, although it took some twists and turns, the broad masses of workers were finally mobilized.

　　To complete this urgent task, the major problem that must be solved first is to obtain 40 tons of steel, and the second is to repair the steel furnace. Thanks to the high level of labor enthusiasm and creativity of all the workers, a waste iron recycling movement was launched in the factory. The workers retrieved the steel materials that they had discarded as waste in the past, thus collecting more than 70 tons of steel, and the raw material problem was solved. As for the repair of the steel furnace, it was mainly the result of the creativity and sleepless efforts of veteran worker Lao Liang. Lao Liang is the head of the steel melting team and a Communist Party member. He created a method of replacing dolomite with refractory bricks and repaired the steel furnace. Lao Liang's method was once opposed by the chief engineer, but the factory director believed that the refractory bricks could withstand a heat of 2,000 degrees, while steelmaking only required 1,500 degrees, so he agreed to his plan. Unfortunately, during the repair process, a worker took the wrong brick. When the furnace was tested after the repair, danger occurred from inside. The molten steel broke through the wall, and if Lao Liang had not sacrificed himself to shut off the power, it would have almost caused an irreversible fire. Although this setback made Lao Liang very anxious and frustrated, after the factory director's comfort and persuasion, and after clarifying the truth of the accident, he started working again with a more positive and responsible spirit. Under Lao Liang's leadership and the efforts of all the workers in the group, the steel furnace was finally repaired, and the steel melting problem was completely solved.

　　The tasks of bridge seats and rivets were completed as scheduled. Because the river was about to thaw, the bridge had to be repaired quickly. The workers of the railway factory responded to the call of the higher authorities and participated in the bridge repair work. On an early spring evening in northern Manchuria, when the river was completely thawed, the repair project of this large railway bridge was also fully completed. Relying on the great power of the working masses, this urgent task of restoring transportation and supporting the front line was successfully completed.

　　Another prominent figure in completing this task was veteran worker Lao Hou. He had worked in this factory for decades. In this emergency task, he influenced many workers with his enthusiasm and confidence. He used the most popular and vivid political mobilization to inspire everyone's emotions and played a leading and backbone role in the work. During the test run ceremony after the bridge was completed, he asked the factory director to join his political party and enthusiastically cheered "Long live Chairman Mao!"

　　“桥”的故事梗概
    自一九四七年一月起，东北战局进入了一个新的阶段：人民解放军在这一年的最初四个月里停止了东北蒋匪军的战略进攻，而在五月以后，我军即转入了全面进攻。这一战争形势的改变，向解放区后方的供给运输工作提出了新的任务，要求铁路交通迅速恢复。
    铁路局工程部部长来到铁路工厂，向厂长说明在一个月内把松花江大铁桥必须修复完竣，而铁路工厂应该在半个月里制出全部需要的桥座和全部需要的铆钉。厂长把这个任务接受下来，同总工程师商量如何完成时，总工程师认为厂里既没有钢，炼钢炉也没有修复，时间又是这样迫促，这任务是根本不能完成的。他摇摇头说：“即使有材料，至少也得四个月！”
    工程师所说的困难都是事实，但任务是紧急而且必须完成的。在这种时候，不是应该强调困难、夸大困难，而是应该设法克服困难。而克服困难的基本办法就在于发动全体工人联员大家动脑动手。总工程师是旧的科学技术人员，他没有看见过，也不懂得群众的力量，其他职员和不少的工人也都没有信心。但是经过在党员中和在积极分子中的动员，虽然费了一番周折，然而终于把广大的工人群众发动起来了。
    要完成这一紧急任务，必须首先解决的重大问题是获得四十吨钢，其次是必须修好熔钢炉。由于全体工人发挥了高度劳动热忱和创造性，厂里展开了废铁翻身运动，工人把他们过去当做废物而抛掉的钢料重新找回来，这样就搜集了七十余吨钢，原料问题因而解决。至于熔钢炉的修复，则主要是工人老梁发挥创作性和不眠不休的努力结果。老梁是化钢组组长，是一个共产党员。他创造了以耐火砖代替白云石的办法，把熔钢炉修起来了。老梁的这种办法是曾经遭到总工程师的反对的，但是厂长认为耐火砖可以抵抗二千度的热度，而炼钢只需一千五百度，因而同意了他的计划。不幸在修复过程中，一位工友拿错了一块砖，在修好后试炉时竟从里发生危险，熔化了的钢水从此处破壁而出，如果不是老梁舍身闭住电门，几乎引起一场不可收拾的大火。这一挫折虽然使老梁十分焦急和颓丧，但经过厂长的安慰劝说，并弄清事故的真相后，他又以更积极更负责的精神重新开始工作了。在老梁的带头和小组全体工友的努力下，熔钢炉终于修好，化钢的问题彻底解决了。
    桥座和铆钉的任务都如期完成了，因为江水即将解冰，桥梁必须赶修，铁路工厂的工人们又响应上级号召，参加了修桥工作。在一个北满初春的晚上，江水全部解冻的时候，这一座大铁桥的修复工程也全部竣工了。依靠工人群众的伟大力量，这一恢复交通、支援前线的紧急的任务遂告胜利完成。
    在完成这一任务当中另一个突出的人物是位老侯头工人。他已在这个厂里做了几十年工，在此次突击任务中，以他的热情和信心影响许多工人，他用最通俗生动的政治动员鼓舞了大家的情绪，在工作中起了带头和骨干作用。在桥梁竣工后举行试车仪式时，他向厂长提出了参加自己的政党的要求，并热情地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
