　　State-Owned Factories in Beiping
  　Promote Production According to Plan
  　Many Factories Have Achieved Significant Results
    [Our Newspaper’s Report] Many state-owned factories in Beiping Municipality began to formulate their annual production plans in late April and have been carrying out production in a step-by-step and planned manner. To date, they have achieved considerable results. The Yanjing Paper Mill planned to produce 200 reams of paper per day before the end of May, but after launching a production competition in early May, the average daily output of paper in May reached about 240 reams, without reducing quality: in the past, many reams exceeded the fixed standard (40 pounds) by four or five pounds, but now very few exceed it by more than one and a half pounds. The two rotary paper cutters originally planned have been completed, and paper will be officially cut on the 20th. The blades on the five pulping knives have all been made, and one has been completely replaced. Currently, in order to solve the long-term problem of raw materials for papermaking, the factory is beginning to experiment with using waste cotton, waste cloth, rice straw, reeds, etc. to make pulp. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory successfully trial-produced water pumps in the half-month period from May 14 to the end of the month, and plans to mass-produce water pumps and electric rollers to solve the problem of farmland water conservancy pumping. It has trial-produced 11 units of ten-row seeders, single-row seeders, chaff cutters, seed selectors, seed cultivators, wheelless plows, single-handle plows, etc. It has repaired three electric steam hammers and one 30-horsepower steel rolling mill, and has rolled out five tons of copper rods. Other equipment, such as 300 waterwheels originally stored in the factory and a cupola (iron smelting furnace) capable of inverting five tons of machines, is also about to be successfully repaired. The First Branch of the factory began manufacturing agricultural insecticide spraying machinery and insecticides in mid-April. In April, it produced 12,000 catties of rotenone powder (for killing aphids), which has all been sold. It also manufactured six powder sprayers. In May, it produced another 9,000 catties of rotenone powder and manufactured ten powder sprayers. The People's Paper Mill produced 2,485 reams of paper from April 18 to May 18, exceeding the original plan, and reduced the daily paper loss from two reams to one ream. In addition, the factory is renovating the No. 1 paper machine, adding various equipment, and the new machine is scheduled to produce paper on June 15. In addition, the First Machine Factory repaired 49 machines that met the standards, equipped 50 hangers, and completed the plan. The Liulihe Cement Plant started work on April 20, and originally planned to complete 10,000 tons of cement and generate 100 kilowatts of electricity in three months, but by May 11 (a total of 20 days), it had completed one-half of the original plan.

　　平市各公营工厂
  　按计划推进生产
  　不少厂已获显著成绩
    【本报讯】北平市许多公营工厂从四月下旬开始定出本年度生产计划，有步骤、有计划地进行生产，至现在已获得不少成绩。燕京造纸厂计划五月底以前日产纸二百令，但在五月初发起生产竞赛后，五月份每日平均出纸达二百四十令左右，质量并未减低：过去每令超过固定标准（四十磅）四、五磅者很多，现超过一磅半者很少。原计划之轮转裁纸刀两部已完成，二十号正式裁纸。五部打浆刀上的刀片都已做好，并已完全换上一部。现该厂为解决长期的造纸原料问题，正开始试验用废棉、废布、稻草、芦苇等做纸浆。华北农业机械总厂从五月十四日至月底半个月时间，试制水泵成功，并计划根据需要大量制造水泵及电滚子，解决农田水利抽水问题。试制出十行播种机、单行播种机、铡草机、选种机、种耕器、无轮犁、单柄犁等共十一部。修好三个电汽锤及三十匹马力之轧钢机一部，并已轧出五吨铜棍。其他如原存该厂之水车三百部、能倒五吨机器用的冲天炉（化铁炉），也即将修建成功。该厂第一分厂自四月中旬开工后，即制造农业杀虫喷药机械及杀虫药剂。四月份只鱼藤粉（杀蚜虫）即生产一万二千斤，并已全部销出。另制喷粉器六部。五月份又生产鱼藤粉九千斤，制造喷粉器十部。人民造纸厂从四月十八日至五月十八日一个月时间，出纸二千四百八十五令，超过原来计划，并由每日损纸两令减为一令。此外，该厂正改装第一号抄纸机，增添各种装备，预定六月十五日新机出纸。其他，第一机器厂修建了合乎标准之机器四十九部，配吊挂五十付，完成了计划。琉璃河水泥厂四月二十号开工后，原计划三个月完成一万吨水泥，发电一百千瓦，但至五月十一日（共二十日）即完成了原计划二分之一。
