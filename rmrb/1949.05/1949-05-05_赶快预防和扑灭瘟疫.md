    Quickly Prevent and Eradicate Plague
    Since the beginning of spring, rainfall has been scarce, the climate dry and erratic, and with sanitation work not yet universally implemented, the plague has been able to occur and spread in many areas. According to current materials, the plague is quite severe in counties such as Liangxiang, Laizhuo, Xushui, and Licheng. For example, in the fifth district of Liangxiang, 269 people in eleven villages have been infected, with 21 deaths; in the sixth district of Laizhuo, there are more than 40 cases, mostly measles and chronic typhoid fever, affecting mainly children aged seven or eight, but also the elderly aged fifty or sixty. Such severe illness has directly impacted people's lives and production! Therefore, in areas where the plague has not yet been discovered, prevention should be expedited, and in areas where the plague has already been discovered, the primary task is to first eradicate it!
    In terms of methods for eradicating the plague, the fifth district of Liangxiang and the sixth district of Laizhuo have already gained successful experience, particularly in using practical medical work to break the masses' superstitious beliefs, allowing the masses to truly understand from their experiences with life and death that "inviting witch doctors," "jumping gods and drinking incense ash," and "drinking holy water"... cannot save lives, and may even lead to death; only scientific medical methods can save lives and reduce deaths. In fact, the Liangxiang medical team has saved 170 patients in the fifth district, which has not only dispelled the superstition of some of the masses, but has also genuinely cared for the masses and saved their lives.
    The experience of eradicating the plague in Liangxiang also tells us that we should not adopt an attitude of blaming the masses for being "backward" in their superstitious beliefs, but should use various methods to carry out scientific propaganda and practical medical treatment, that is, to replace superstition with science and "witch doctors" with medical treatment. Only in this way can we seize the position of feudal superstition, guide the masses towards science, and reduce unnecessary deaths. Therefore, we must oppose those who do not care about the people's illnesses, and those who only complain about the people's "backwardness" and do not honestly solve specific difficulties for the people!
    Summer is approaching, and cities are places with concentrated populations, so epidemic prevention work is especially important. Therefore, it is suggested that the government not only quickly send medical teams to eradicate the plague spreading in rural areas, but also strengthen sanitation work in cities!

    赶快预防和扑灭瘟疫
    入春以来雨水缺少，气候干燥，忽冷忽热，加以清洁卫生工作尚未能普遍展开的情况下，瘟疫遂得以在不少地区发生和流行起来。仅据现在所得材料，已有良乡、涞涿、徐水、黎城等数县瘟疫流行相当严重，如良乡五区有十一个村得疫症者即达二百六十九人，已死者二十一人；涞涿六区有四十余人，病症大部是麻疹、慢性伤寒，病者一部分是七、八岁的孩子，也有五、六十岁的老人。象这样严重的病象，已经直接影响到人民的生命和生产了！因此，在未发现瘟疫的地区，应该赶快预防，在已发现瘟疫的地区，首要工作则是先行扑灭瘟疫！
    在扑灭瘟疫的办法上，良乡五区、涞涿六区都已经取得成功的经验，特别是用医疗的实际工作来打破群众的迷信思想，使群众得以真正从生与死的体验里，认识到“请神婆”、“跳神喝香灰”、“喝神水”……并不能救生，甚至致人于死；只有用科学的医疗方法，才能挽救死亡和减少死亡。而且在实际上，良乡医疗队已在五区救活病人达一百七十名，这不仅破除了一部分群众的迷信，而且真正关心了群众，救活了群众的生命。
    从良乡扑灭瘟疫的经验中，还告诉了我们一点，即对群众的迷信思想不应当采取埋怨“落后”的态度，而应当利用各种方式进行科学的宣传，进行实际的医疗，即用科学代替迷信，用医疗代替“神婆”，只有如此，才能夺去封建迷信的阵地，引导人民群众走向科学，减少不必要的死亡。因此，必须反对那些不关心群众疾病，和那些光埋怨群众“落后”，不去老老实实为群众具体解决困难的说空话者！
    夏季即至，城市为人口集中的地方，防疫工作，尤其重要，因此，建议政府除迅速设法派出医疗队扑灭蔓延在农村的瘟疫外，城市的卫生工作亦应加强起来！
