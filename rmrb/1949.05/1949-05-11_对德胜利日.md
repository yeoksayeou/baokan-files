Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 9th: Moscow - The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 8th to commemorate tomorrow's Victory Day, the fourth anniversary of the Soviet army's victory over Fascist Germany. The editorial wrote: Decades and centuries will pass, but the Soviet people will never forget the heroic battles of the sons and daughters of all nationalities of the Soviet Union who fought for the glory, freedom, and independence of the motherland during the Great Patriotic War. This war, imposed on us by the enemy, was a comprehensive test of the material and spiritual strength of the Soviet people, and a rigorous examination of the solidity and strength of the Soviet system. This war proved that our people and the socialist state created by them and led by the wise Lenin and Stalin Party are capable of creating miracles and achieving victory under unprecedentedly severe tests.

"Pravda" continued, Germany and its allies had deployed significant elite forces to our motherland, twice the number of German troops that fought against Tsarist Russia during the First World War. The ruling groups of the United States and Britain deliberately delayed the opening of the Second Front, hoping that the Soviet Union would be exhausted in a long battle against a dangerous and terrible enemy alone. But all these calculations suffered a complete and utter defeat. The great nation created by Lenin and Stalin, the leaders and teachers of the working people, not only defended itself, but also destroyed the German fascist aggressors, brought freedom to the people of Europe, and saved European civilization. The whole world has witnessed the great vitality and invincibility of the Soviet social and state system, the power of its army, and the omnipotence of the Communist Party's wise policies. The paper continued, when the war was nearing its end and it was obvious that the Soviet Union was capable of inflicting the final blow on Germany alone, imperialists of all countries hoped that the unbelievably serious destruction suffered by the Soviet national economy at the hands of the fascists would set the Soviet Union back decades. However, reality itself negated these calculations. Our people's enemies forgot that they were dealing with a country that could not be measured by the usual standards of capitalist society.

The paper said: In the post-war period, which was the most difficult period in our history, it was not an easy task to transform the national economy to adapt to the conditions and tasks of peaceful construction. While capitalist countries are still unable to overcome the most acute contradictions of the post-war period to this day, the Soviet Union, after the end of the war, has begun to rapidly and confidently move along the road of restoring and further developing the economy. Before the war, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, made a huge leap from backwardness to progress and built a socialist society, thus creating a prerequisite for active preparation for national defense during the war and for a victorious transition to a peaceful system in the post-war period. The reason why the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are victoriously overcoming the difficulties of the post-war period is their spiritual and political unity and fraternal friendship, and the fact that they are inspired by ardent Soviet patriotism. After the end of the war, our motherland has won a series of victories because it is led by the Communist Party, which is armed with progressive revolutionary theory, which helps us understand the present and look forward to the future.

At the beginning of the first post-war year, Stalin, in his epoch-making speech on February 9, 1946, showed a joyful and moving prospect of socialist construction. Now, everyone can see that the Soviet people are victoriously implementing Stalin's instructions embodied in the post-war Five-Year Plan. Our country has entered a new period of great and far-reaching upsurge. All the war wounds we have suffered have not yet been completely healed, but their recovery is proceeding rapidly and decisively. In 1948 alone, the funds used for basic construction projects in areas damaged by German occupation amounted to 20 billion rubles, which did not include local construction investments. In 1948, the total industrial output in these areas increased by 41 percent compared to 1947. In cities, nearly 8 million square meters of houses have been restored and newly built, and in rural areas, more than 300,000 houses have been restored and built.

In 1948, the Soviet national economy not only reached the pre-war level, but even surpassed it. Soviet peasants have launched a great movement to transform nature and strive for a new upsurge in animal husbandry. All these upsurges are based on our own resources, based on the self-sacrificing labor efforts of the Soviet people; while European capitalist countries place their main hope on receiving the enslaving "aid" of the Marshall Plan.

### 对德胜利日

    对德胜利日
    【新华社北平九日电】莫斯科讯：真理报八日发表社论纪念明日的胜利日，即苏军战胜法西斯德国的第四周年纪念日。社论写道：几十年和几世纪将要过去，但是苏维埃人民永将不忘苏联各族人民的儿女在伟大爱国战争期间为祖国的光荣、自由与独立而战的英雄的战斗。敌人强加于我们的这次战争是对苏维埃人民的物质和精神力量的全面考验，是对苏维埃制度的坚固和力量的严格审查。这次战争证明：我国人民以及由他们手创而由英明的列宁与斯大林党领导的社会主义国家在空前严重的考验下，是能够创造奇迹和获得胜利的。
    真理报继称，德国及其盟国曾把重要的精锐部队投向我们祖国，其数量有第一次世界大战时对沙俄作战的德军二倍之多。美英统治集团曾故意拖延第二战场的开辟，希望苏联在对危险可怕的敌人单独进行漫长的战斗中，精疲力竭。但是这一切的盘算都遭到了完全的惨败。劳动人民的天才领袖与导师列宁斯大林所缔造的伟大国家不仅保卫了自己，而且还摧毁了德国法西斯侵略者，给欧洲人民带来了自由并拯救了欧洲的文明。整个世界都目击了苏维埃的社会和国家制度的伟大生命力与不可征服性，它的军队的威力，共产党的英明政策的万能。该报继写道，当战争将近结束和苏联有能力单独予德国以最后打击已属明显时，各国帝国主义者希望法西斯分子使苏联国民经济遭受的难以相信地严重的破坏会把苏联推后几十年。然而现实生活本身否定了这些盘算。我们人民的敌人忘记了他们是对付一个用资本主义社会平常的尺度所不能对之应用的国家。
    该报说：在战后是我国历史上最困难的时期，使国民经济转化而适应和平建设的条件和任务，这并不是一件容易工作。当资本主义国家直到今天仍然没有能力克服战后时期最尖锐的矛盾的时候，苏维埃国度在结束了战争之后，已开始迅速地与满怀信心地沿着恢复与进一步发展经济的道路迈进。战前，苏维埃人民在布尔什维克党领导下，作出了从落后到进步的巨大飞跃，并且建设了社会主义社会，因而创造了一个先决条件，使在战争期间，国防上有积极的准备，在战后时期，胜利地向和平体制转化。苏联各族人民正胜利地克服战后时期的困难，其原因就是他们精神上政治上的团结与兄弟般的友谊，和他们被热烈的苏维埃爱国精神所鼓舞这一事实。战争结束后，我们祖国之所以获得一连串的胜利，是因为它是被为进步的革命理论所武装的共产党所领导，而这种进步的革命理论帮助我们了解现在和瞻望未来。
    在战后第一年开始的时候，斯大林在他的一九四六年二月九日发表的划时代的演说中，展示了愉快的和动人的社会主义建设的远景。现在，每一个人都看得到，苏联人民正胜利地实施这一体现在战后五年计划中的斯大林的指示。我国已进入了新的远大的高涨的时期。我们所蒙受的一切战争创伤尚未全部治愈，但其复原则是快速和确定地进行着。仅在一九四八年这一年，用于曾受德国占领之损害的地区的基本建筑工程的经费就达二百亿卢布，其中并不包括地方性的建设投资在内。一九四八年这些地区的工业总产量较一九四七年增加了百分之四十一，在城市中已修复和新建的房屋，面积近八百万平方公尺，在乡村则修复和建造了三十余万间房屋。
    一九四八年，苏联国民经济不仅已达到了战前水平，甚至还超过了战前水平。苏维埃农民为改造自然和争取畜牧业的新高涨起见，业已发起了伟大的运动。所有这些高涨都是基于我们本国的资源，基于苏维埃人民自我牺牲的劳动努力；而欧洲资本主义国家则把他们的主要希望寄托在接受奴役性的马歇尔计划的“援助”上。
