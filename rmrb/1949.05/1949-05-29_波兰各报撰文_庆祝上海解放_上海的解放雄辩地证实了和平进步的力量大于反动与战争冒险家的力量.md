　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 28th: The Polish Press Agency reports: The Worker's Agency wrote an article on the 25th celebrating the liberation of Shanghai by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It stated: The capture of Shanghai is of great significance, not only because it is one of China's strategic strongholds and economic centers, but also because Shanghai is the main center of foreign imperialist forces' infiltration into China, and it is a base for imperialist activities. The flag of People's China flying in Shanghai is a symbol of the Chinese nation's victory over colonialists, exploiters, and oppressors. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is advancing irresistibly towards final victory. The front line has far surpassed Shanghai, and now telegrams of war news have begun to mention Guangzhou. The recent victories make us sincerely happy, not only because these victories bring freedom to a nation that has fought for freedom for decades, but also because they indicate that the peace camp has greatly strengthened. The liberation of Shanghai eloquently confirms that the forces of peace and progress are greater than those of reaction and war adventurers. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is advancing towards new victories! The forces of peace are growing!
    On the 27th, all Polish newspapers headlined the news of the liberation of Shanghai by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Warsaw newspaper editorial said: This is a painful blow to world capitalism and the entire colonial exploitation system. World imperialists regarded Shanghai as the most convenient place to ruthlessly exploit cheap labor and as the best springboard for economically and politically conquering China and the Far East. Shanghai was the birthplace of the dirtiest conspiracies. International fascists and semi-fascists, from the Tsarist White Guards to the desperadoes of the Anders Army (the Anders Army was a reactionary army left overseas by the wartime Polish government-in-exile and used by the US and Britain), used Shanghai as a base for their active operations. Now that Shanghai has been liberated, it is no longer the "sewer of the world."

　　波兰各报撰文
  　庆祝上海解放
    上海的解放雄辩地证实了和平进步的力量大于反动与战争冒险家的力量
    【新华社北平二十八日电】波兰通讯社讯：工人通讯社二十五日撰文庆祝中国人民解放军解放上海。内称：攻克上海有重大意义，并不仅仅因为它是中国的战略据点与经济中心之一，上海也是外国帝国主义者的势力渗入中国的主要中心，它是帝国主义的活动基地。飘扬在上海的人民中国的旗帜是中华民族战胜殖民者、剥削者和压迫者的象征。中国人民解放军正在不可抵挡地向最后胜利挺进。战线已远远地越过了上海，现在战事的电报开始提到广州了。最近的胜利使我们衷心的快乐，这不仅是因为这些胜利为一个几十年来为自由而战的民族带来了自由，也是因为表示和平阵营大为加强。上海的解放雄辩地证实了和平进步的力量大于反动与战争冒险家的力量。中国人民解放军正在向新的胜利前进！和平力量正在生长！
    二十七日波兰各报都以中国人民解放军解放上海的消息为头条标题。华沙报社论说：这对于世界资本主义和整个殖民地剥削制度是痛苦的一击。世界帝国主义者把上海看作是无情剥削廉价劳动力的最方便的场所，看作是在经济上与政治上征服中国和远东的最好的跳板，上海是最肮脏的阴谋的降生地。国际法西斯主义和半法西斯主义分子，从沙皇的自卫军到安德斯军（安德斯军是战时波兰流亡政府留在海外，供美英驱使的反动军队）的亡命之徒，把上海当作他们积极活动的基地。现在上海解放了，它不再是“世界的污水沟”了。
