    Ping Trade Company
    Assists Grain Merchants in Purchasing Grain Out of Customs
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to encourage and assist private merchants to go to the Northeast to purchase and transport food grains, the Grain Branch of the Beiping Trade Company specially invited fourteen grain merchants, including Kuiyuan Grain Store and Tongyuan Freight Forwarding, to hold a symposium yesterday (the 14th) at the company. Representatives from the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Commerce, the Municipal Committee, and other units attended. The meeting discussed the purchase and transportation methods: representatives elected by the grain merchants, in coordination with personnel from the grain company, will first go to the Northeast to conduct investigations, understand the situation, and prepare for purchase and transportation. As for the issues of remittance of funds and transportation due to the different currency systems in the two regions, the company will negotiate with relevant departments.

    协助粮商出关购粮
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司粮食分公司为鼓励与协助私商赴东北购运食粮，特于昨日（十四日）在该公司邀请魁元粮店、通远货栈等十四家粮商举行座谈会。北平市商局、市委会等单位均有代表出席参加。会上商讨了购运办法：由各粮商推选代表，配合粮食公司人员，先往东北进行调查，了解情况，作购运之准备。至于因两地币制不同而需要汇拨款项及运输等问题，则由该公司向有关部门商洽。
