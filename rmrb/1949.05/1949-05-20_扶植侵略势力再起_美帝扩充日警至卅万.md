Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: Under the direction and support of US imperialism, the Japanese House of Representatives passed a bill to expand police force on the evening of the 16th. This is another major step taken by US imperialism to actively support the re-emergence of Japanese aggressive forces after announcing the cancellation of the reparations plan on the 12th. This reactionary bill, under the absurd pretext of "the recent changes in the international situation require the police to ensure social stability," calls for improving the police organization and adjusting the relationship between national and local police. Before the war, Japan had 65,000 police officers. After the war, although the Japanese Constitution clearly stipulates that Japan "forever renounces war and does not maintain land, sea, and air forces," under the active support of US imperialism, the Japanese aggressive armed forces have been restored under the guise of expanding the police force. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Finance in October last year, the Japanese police force has expanded to 142,000, excluding the number of so-called maritime police, railway police, and secret police. The Japanese government has established six police control zones according to the division of the former six Japanese military control zones, undertaking the duties of secret training and arming the Japanese army. The US occupation authorities in Japan have openly advocated that the Japanese ordinary police force should be expanded to 275,000. If this number is added to other special police forces, the number will reach 300,000, exceeding the pre-war regular Japanese army of 230,000.

### 扶植侵略势力再起　美帝扩充日警至卅万

　　扶植侵略势力再起
  　美帝扩充日警至卅万
    【新华社北平十九日电】东京消息：在美国帝国主义的指使和支持下，日本众院于十六日晚通过扩充警察武力法案。这是美国帝国主义继十二日宣布取消赔偿计划之后。积极扶植日本侵略势力再起的又一重大步骤。这一反动法案在“因最近国际形势变化需要警察保障社会安定”的荒谬借口下，要求改良警察组织，调整国家与地方警察之间的关系等。日本在战前共有警察六万五千人。战后，虽然日本宪法明文规定日本“永远放弃战争，不保持陆海空军”，但在美帝国主义的积极扶持下，日本侵略武装力量在扩充警察的掩护下被恢复起来。据去年十月日本大藏省的统计，日本警察已扩充至十四万二千人，所谓海上警察、铁路警察及秘密警察的人数尚未计算在内。日本政府已按前日本六个军管区的划分，设立六个警管区，担任秘密训练与武装日本陆军的职务。美国驻日占领当局曾公开主张日本普通警察应扩充至二十七万五千人，这一数字如果加上其他特种警察，为数将达三十万人，超过战前日本陆军常备军二十三万人的数目。
