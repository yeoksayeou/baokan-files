Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: Late news: A certain corps of the People's Liberation Army, which advanced into southern Anhui, issued instructions on the 4th, calling on the entire corps to learn from the excellent work style of the southern Anhui People's Guerrilla隊 and to enhance the unity between the field army and the guerrilla队. The instructions pointed out that the southern Anhui People's Guerrilla队 had been independently fighting in the difficult environment of enemy blockade and suppression for a long time. However, they smashed the enemy's many "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and led the local people to carry out the "five anti-movements" of resisting conscription, resisting forced labor, resisting grain requisition, resisting levies, and resisting taxes, as well as struggles to protect the autumn harvest and oppose special agents. From the initial small area of activity in Jingxian, Jingde, and Taiping, they expanded to a vast area of 40 counties in western Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and northeastern Jiangxi. From the initial few people, they expanded to more than 7,000 people when the large army crossed the Yangtze River. The guerrilla队 paid great attention to observing mass discipline, consulted with the common people on everything they did, and the common people also asked the guerrilla队 to help solve any difficulties they had. The guerrilla队 established an extremely close relationship with the people. The instructions particularly pointed out the merits of the People's Guerrilla队 in actively cooperating with and fully supporting the field army's Yangtze River crossing operation. The People's Guerrilla队 prepared 2,000 pairs of shoes and 4,000 shi of grain for the field army in the Shitai district alone. Guerrilla队 from various places went out to pursue fleeing enemies, making the fleeing enemies dare not hide in the mountains. They promptly surrounded the cities held by the enemy, facilitating the field army to encircle and annihilate them. The People's Guerrilla队 paid great attention to implementing the new district policies and urban policies. In many towns they occupied and took over, such as Qingyang, Shitai, Taiping, Shexian, Tunxi, and the famous Huangshan Mountain in southern Anhui, their discipline was very good, and social order was stable. The instructions called on all departments of the entire corps to compile teaching materials, widely introduce the above-mentioned advantages of the southern Anhui People's Guerrilla队 to the troops in depth, humbly learn from them, and warmly extend condolences to the fraternal troops who persisted in the revolutionary struggle in Jiangnan, and closely unite with the guerrilla队.

　　我某兵团指示全军
    向皖南游击队学习
    【新华社南京二十一日电】迟到消息：挺进皖南的人民解放军某兵团曾于四日发出指示，号召全兵团学习皖南人民游击队的优良作风及增进野战军与游击队的团结。指示中指出皖南人民游击队长期处于敌人封锁与清剿的艰难环境中独立作战，但他们粉碎了敌人多次的清剿，领导当地人民胜利地进行抗丁、抗夫、抗粮、抗捐、抗税的“五抗运动”与保卫秋收、反对特务等斗争，从最初的泾县、旌德、太平狭小的活动地区扩大到浙西、苏南及赣东北等四十个县的广大地区，从最初的几个人扩大到大军渡江时的七千余人。游击队十分注意遵守群众纪律，做什么事情都和老百姓商量，老百姓有什么困难也要求游击队帮助解决，游击队与人民建立了极为密切的关系。指示中特别指出了人民游击队积极配合和全力支援此次野战军渡江作战的功绩。人民游击队仅在石埭一个区即为野战军准备了二千双鞋和四千石粮食。各地游击队四出追击逃敌，使逃敌不敢逃匿山区。他们把敌人据守的城市及时包围起来，便利野战军前去围歼。人民游击队十分注意执行新区政策和城市政策，他们在占领和接管的许多城镇，如青阳、石埭、太平、歙县、屯溪和皖南名胜黄山等地，纪律都很良好，社会秩序安定。指示号召全兵团各部编制教材，广泛地向部队深入介绍皖南人民游击队的上述各项优点，虚心地进行学习并向坚持江南革命斗争的兄弟部队进行热烈的慰问，与游击队亲密团结。
