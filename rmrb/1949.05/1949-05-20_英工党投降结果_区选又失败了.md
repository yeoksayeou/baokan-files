Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the British Labour Party has suffered another defeat in the district elections, following its failure in the county elections in April. This is a result of the Labour Party's right-wing leadership surrendering to American imperialism externally and colluding with monopoly capitalists internally to implement a traitorous anti-communist and anti-people policy. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 14th, the Labour Party won only 1,778 seats in the district elections in England, Wales, and London, a net loss of 646 seats (Agence France-Presse puts the figure at 714). The Conservative Party won a total of 1,856 seats, a net gain of 532 seats. Elsewhere, the Communist Party won 14 seats, and the Liberal Party won 107 seats. Independents won 941 seats, with no major changes in these groups.

　　In this district election, former Labour Party left-wing candidates gained the support of voters. For example, Labour MP Mr. Mills, who was expelled by the Labour Party's right-wing leadership, and another expelled Labour Party member, Crossley, were both elected as members of the Finsbury Borough Council of London on May 13 with more votes than the official Labour Party candidates. The expelled Labour Party member Hall was also elected in another district.

　　英工党投降结果
  　区选又失败了
    【新华社北平十八日电】各方报道：英工党继四月郡选失败之后，现又在区选举中遭受失败。这是工党右翼领导机关对外向美帝国主义投降，对内勾结独占资本家实行反共反人民的叛卖政策之结果。据路透社十四日电，工党在这次区选举中，在英格兰、威尔土与伦敦区只获一千七百七十八席，净失六百四十六席（法新社统计为七百十四席）。保守党共获一千八百五十六席，净得五百三十二席。其他，共产党获十四席，自由党获一百零七席。无党派获九百四十一席，均无大变化。
    在这次区选举中，前工党左翼的候选人获得了选民的支持。例如被工党右翼领导机关开除的工党议员米尔斯和另一被开除的工党党员克罗斯利都在五月十三日以多于工党官方候选人的票数，当选为伦敦市芬伯利区委员会委员。被开除的工党党员哈尔也在另一区中当选。
