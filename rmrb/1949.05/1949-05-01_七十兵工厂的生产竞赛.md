Since the Sixth Division of the 70th Arsenal initiated a production competition, the First Division's machine shop immediately responded. Representatives of the workers and the workers' union from the First and Sixth Divisions met to discuss the competition methods. Each worker had already prepared the tools and materials needed from cutting to producing the finished product, and everyone was excitedly wiping down their machines, preparing to strive for victory. On the 26th, the day the competition began, the sky was a bit gloomy at noon. Although it drizzled a few drops of rain, many people said, "Even if it rains heavily, it doesn't matter, we still have to be active in production!" Red and green slogans on the walls read: "Pliers and cutters move together, the front lines will surely win. Big wheels and small wheels turn together, make good guns and bullets for the front!" At 4:30 PM, the motors roared like a mountain flood from afar, whirring... the wheels turned, and the belts also turned tensely. Every worker became tense with the turning of the machine wheels, determined to ensure that the output quantity exceeded the planned production quantity. Everyone was determined to win the banner; even when going to the toilet, they ran back and forth. When you walked into the factory building, you could only hear the sound of the machines. Apprentices were preparing tools and materials, and the technicians were sweating profusely. Everyone said, "Even if we don't win the banner, we must double our output, complete our production tasks, and vow to be the backing of the southward advancing army."

\tChen Zhongli from the Sixth Division was sweating, his hands moving hastily. What used to take a quarter of an hour to complete now only took ten minutes. The worker calculating the time held the roster and looked at the watch on his hand. Several people said, "That's really something!" Du Xuze stared at the lathe with both eyes and said, "The small knife is fast!" The knife touched the iron material, making a "zzz" sound, and oil smoke rose. Fu Wanxu turned the crank, tilting his neck, and completed one after another quickly. In the past, drilling was twenty holes per day, but now the goal was to reach fifty.

    七十兵工厂的生产竞赛
    七十兵工厂自第六所发起生产竞赛以后，第一所机工部马上就响应了。第一、第六两所的职工代表职工会代表和厂房，就开会讨论竞赛办法，各工友由切料到出成品所需用的工具、材料早都准备好了，人人都兴奋地擦拭着机器，预备争取胜利。当二十六号开始竞赛那天，中午的天色有点阴沉，虽然下了几滴雨，但许多人都说：“就下大雨也不要紧，生产还是要积极！”墙上的红绿标语写着：“钳刀钳子一齐动，前方一定打胜仗，大轮小轮一齐转，造好枪弹送前线！”下午四点半了，马达象一阵山洪从远方奔来，哗啦啦……轮子转动了，皮带也紧张的转动着，每个工友都随着机器轮子转动而紧张起来，坚决保证使出品数量超过预定的生产数量。大家决心夺取锦旗，就是到厕所去，都是跑着来回，当你走到厂房里的时候，只能听到机器的声音，学徒在旁边预备工具材料，技工们是汗流夹背的干，大家都说“不夺到锦旗也要使出品增加一倍，完成我们的生产任务，誓为南进大军后盾”。
    六所陈中立头上流着汗，两手急忙的动作，以前要一刻钟方能完成的，现在只要十分钟就得了。计算时间的工友拿着名册，看着手上的表，好几个人都说：“真是够劲！”杜续泽用两只眼睛注视着车子说：“小刀可快！”刀子碰着铁料，发出“兹兹”的响声，油烟冒了起来，傅万煜掘着摇把，脖子一斜，不一会一个一个地加速地完成了。以前钻孔每天是二十个，现在要达到五十个了。
