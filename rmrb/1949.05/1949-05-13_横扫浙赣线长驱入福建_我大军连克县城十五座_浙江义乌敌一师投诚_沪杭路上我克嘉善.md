    Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 12th – The People’s Liberation Army on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi front is sweeping away Kuomintang bandit troops along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line and advancing rapidly south along the entire line. From the 5th to the 10th, they captured fifteen county towns in succession, penetrating more than one hundred and several tens of miles south of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and crossed the Wuyi Mountains into Fujian Province. Under the PLA’s blitzkrieg-like assault, the Kuomintang bandit troops in various places were in chaos, lacking any fighting spirit, and were either annihilated or scattered and fled. The People's Liberation Army on the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line captured the thirteen county towns of Jiangshan, Longyou, Lanxi, Jinhua, Yiwu, Dongyang, Yongkang, Wuyi, Jinyun, Lishui, Xuanping, Songyang, and Suichang along the line and to the south of the line from the 5th to the 10th. In the operations, the People's Liberation Army captured more than 7,000 remnant bandit troops from the enemy's 45th Army, 50th Army, 55th Army, 85th Army, 106th Army, 318th Division, and non-regular troops such as the Anhui Military Region. Among the captured prisoners, enemy generals identified included Chen Gan, lieutenant general and deputy commander of the enemy's Anhui Military Region, Yang Yan, chief of staff, Liu Shudao, major general and deputy commander of the Southern Anhui Garrison District, and Luo Xuanwu, major general and deputy education officer of the Provisional Second Column Training Team. The huge spoils of war included more than 18 million rounds of ammunition, and more than 400 vehicles were seized in the Jiangshan area alone. The People's Liberation Army, advancing rapidly south from Shangrao and Qianshan on the central section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, crossed the Wuyi Mountains on the 9th and liberated Chong'an County in Fujian. The remaining enemy fled south. The People's Liberation Army, advancing towards the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, captured the important town of Linchuan, southeast of Nanchang, on the 9th, and the defending enemy fled west in a panic. Currently, the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road from Jinxian in the east to Yiwu is under the control of the People's Liberation Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 12th – Liao Yunze, commander of the 110th Division of the Kuomintang Army's 85th Army, led his troops of 5,000 men to surrender to the People's Liberation Army in Yiwu County, northeast of Jinhua, Zhejiang, on the 9th. It is reported that this army was rebuilt in Zhejiang after being annihilated in the Huaihai Campaign.
    Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, Changzhou, 12th – The People's Liberation Army liberated Jiashan County on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway on the morning of the 10th, annihilating more than 100 enemy troops. The remaining enemy troops fled towards Shanghai.
