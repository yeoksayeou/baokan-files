Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, Berlin: The Executive Committee of the Berlin Democratic Bloc convened a rally of Berlin's working people at 3:00 PM on the 12th in the August-Bebel-Platz in central Berlin. The grand square and Unter den Linden street were packed with 500,000 people. A sea of red flags, red-black-and-gold flags, slogans, and banners marked the joyful mood of Berliners due to the agreement reached by the four occupying powers to lift inter-zonal restrictions and hold a Foreign Ministers' Conference. Scarlet banners called for the struggle for the unification of Germany and Berlin, for peace, and for the most rapid restoration of economic ties between East and West Germany. Many banners called for active participation in the elections for delegates to the Third German People's Congress to be held on the 15th and 16th.

The rally was opened by Ms. Starkwendien-Kehrer, a Christian Democratic Union city councilor of the Democratic City Council. She said: "We do not want our country to have occupation statutes, nor do we want a West Germany or an East Germany, but a unified Germany with Berlin as its capital."

The first to address the conference was Professor Kastner (leader of the Liberal Democratic Party), Chairman of the Presidium of the German People's Council. He said that when electing delegates to the Third German People's Congress on May 15th and 16th, Berlin must stand up for the unification and peace of Germany. "We want to be a unified nation."

The Mayor of Greater Berlin, Ebert, said in his speech: "The West declares that to achieve German unification, the democratic reforms in the Eastern zone must be revised. The only answer to this is: they cannot take back the publicly owned enterprises, nor can they take back the land that has been distributed among the new peasants. Public ownership is the economic foundation of the rule of the working people."

Dieter, Chairman of the Berlin Federation of Free German Trade Unions, said that the task of the working people of Berlin is to end Berlin's crisis and division.

Müller, the representative of the Social Democratic faction in the Democratic Bloc, denounced those who undermine peace and unity as agents employed by the arms magnates.

Jendretzky, Chairman of the Berlin Party Organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, called for the use of the occupying powers' resumed negotiations to establish a broad national front. He said that it is necessary to abandon all narrow party views and begin discussing the future of Germany and Berlin. All democratic and patriotic forces must currently devote themselves to rebuilding the unity of Berlin and preparing a memorandum for the Paris Conference on behalf of all of Berlin.

The conference passed the following resolution: "We, the people of all occupation zones and all strata of Berlin, who participated in the mass rally convened by the Democratic Bloc on May 12th, celebrate the success of the peace policy reflected in the lifting of restrictions and the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris on May 23rd. This result is the undeniable achievement of the continuous peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving forces in the world."

　　柏林五十万劳动人民集会
  　庆祝取消区际限制
    为统一和平民主的德国继续奋斗
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社柏林讯：柏林民主联盟执行委员会于十二日下午三时在中柏林的奥古斯特、倍倍尔广场召开柏林劳动人民大会。大广场和菩提树下街中挤满了五十万人。红旗、红黑黄三色旗、标语和旗帜之海，标志着柏林人因四占领国达到取消区际限制，召开外长会议的协议而感到的快乐情绪。猩红的旗帜号召为德国与柏林的统一、为和平、为最迅速地恢复东德与西德间的经济纽带而斗争。很多旗帜号召积极参加十五、十六两日举行的第三届德国人民代表大会代表的选举。
    集会由民主市参议会基督教民主联盟女议员斯塔克文登席希揭幕。她说：“我们不要我们的国家有占领法规，也不要西德或东德国，而是要以柏林为首都的统一的德国。”
    第一个向大会演讲的是德国人民委员会主席团主席卡斯纳教授（自由民主党领袖）。他说：在五月十五、十六两日选举第三届德国人民代表大会的代表时，柏林必须出而拥护德国的统一和和平。“我们要成为一个统一的民族”。
    大柏林市长艾柏特在其演说中说：“西方宣布，为获得德国的统一必须修改东占区的民主改革。对此，唯一答复是：他们无法把公有的企业拿回去，他们也无法把在新农民间分配了的土地拿回去。公有是劳动人民的统治的经济基础。”
    柏林自由德国职工会联合会主席第特尔说：柏林劳动人民的任务是结束柏林的危机和分裂状态。
    民主联盟集团中社会民主党党团的代表米勒，斥责那些破坏和平与统一的人为军火大王所雇佣的代理人。
    德国统一社会党柏林党组织主席詹德茨基号召利用占领国的恢复谈判来建立广泛的全国阵线。他说，抛弃一切和每一种狭隘的党派政见，开始讨论德国和柏林的未来，乃是必要的。一切民主和爱国力量在目前必须致力于重建柏林的统一，并准备全柏林给巴黎会议的备忘录。
    大会通过决议如下：“我们参加民主联盟所召开的五月十二日群众大会的柏林各占领区、各阶层的人民，庆贺反映在取消限制和于五月二十三日在巴黎召开外长会议的和平政策的成功。这个结果，是苏联及全世界一切爱好和平力量所进行的持续的和平政策的无可争辩的成就。”
