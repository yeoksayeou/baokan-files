Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch: Large-scale Yellow River management has begun in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. After two years of effort, the Yellow River management project in this region has achieved unprecedented and enormous results. However, given the manpower and resources available under wartime conditions, this year's Yellow River project aims to: "Select the most dangerous sections for repair," "Prioritize firmness and material conservation," and "Emphasize both repair and maintenance, with no breaches allowed." That is, this year's project will use the standard of being 7 centimeters higher than the highest water level in 1937 (Republican Year 26) and the dangerous sections and embankments being 2 centimeters higher than that. All sections that do not meet this standard must be repaired to ensure no breaches occur, and to lay the foundation for future Yellow River water conservancy construction. To achieve this goal, a total of 2,942,645 cubic meters of earth are needed for levee restoration, dam base repairs, and other tasks this year. In terms of levee restoration, the focus is on Quhe, Dongming, Yunbei, Kunshan, and Shouzhang, with the Shouzhang and Yunbei projects being the largest. Shouzhang requires 564,768 cubic meters of earth, and Yunbei requires 510,512 cubic meters. The major hazardous areas are the sections of Dongming, Nanhua, Juancheng, Kunshan, Quhe, Kunwu, Xuhe, Dong'e, Hexi, and Qiyu. For example, Kunshan requires 13,000 cubic meters of stone, 1 million catties of straw, and 1.3 million catties of willow fascines. Other counties also require a large number of engineering materials. These materials began to be collected and transported last winter. Except for the stone materials in Kunshan and the bricks in Dongming and Nanhua, which have been collected and transported, the stone materials for other sections are being transported at full speed.

　　冀鲁豫大规模治黄开始
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫大规模治黄工程开始。本区治黄工程经过两年的努力，已获空前巨大成绩，但根据战争情况下的人力和物力，今年的黄河工程要求做到：“择险修整”，“坚固省料”“修守并重、不准溃决”，即今年的工程，以高出民国二十六年最高水位七公寸、险工坝埽高出二公寸为标准。凡不够此标准者，均需加修，以保证不溃决，并打下今后黄河水利建设的基础。为达此要求，今年复堤、修坝基等，合计需土二百九十四万二千六百四十五方。在复堤方面，以曲河、东明、郓北、昆山、寿张为重点，其中尤以寿张与郓北两地工程为最大，寿张需土五十六万四千七百六十八方，郓北需土五十一万零五百一十二方；险工以东明、南华、鄄城、昆山、曲河、昆吾、徐河、东阿、河西、齐禹等段工程为大，如昆山除了需石一万三千方外，尚需秸料百万斤，柳枋一百三十万斤，其他各县亦需大批工科。这些工料，在去年冬季即开始集运，现除昆山之石料，东明、南华等县的砖已集运完毕外，其余各段石料，亦正紧张赶运中。
