Lenin and Soviet Foreign Policy
By Frantsev, translated by Chen Peiming

To understand current international problems, one must understand Soviet foreign policy. Soviet foreign policy differs fundamentally from the foreign policy of capitalist countries. The foreign policy of capitalist imperialist countries, built on a system of human exploitation, can only be a policy of outward expansion and aggression. Conversely, the foreign policy of a socialist country that has abolished the system of human exploitation must be a democratic policy of peace and friendly cooperation. Without understanding this essential difference, one cannot understand the struggles existing today between the two camps (on the one hand, the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the people of the colonies and semi-colonies, and the working people of the world; on the other hand, the capitalist imperialist countries and their running dogs).

In this article, Frantsev expounds on Lenin’s valuable lessons regarding foreign policy: First, oppose all wars of aggression; second, respect the independence, sovereignty, and interests of all nations; third, socialist countries and capitalist countries can coexist; fourth, be prepared at any time to deal with the attacks of imperialist bandits; fifth, open diplomacy, especially when international relations are tense, must be open and frank in telling the people of all countries the truth. These principles are the diplomatic policies consistently pursued by the Russian government after the October Revolution, which achieved great victories.

Chinese Communists and non-Party Bolsheviks, who take Marxism-Leninism as their guide to action, must study and master Lenin's basic principles regarding foreign policy. --Editor's Note

I. Oppose the Wars of Aggression by Imperialist Bandits

The great October Socialist Revolution, which marked a turning point in world history, profoundly changed the entire system of international relations. A Soviet socialist country was established, the first of its kind. This country, unlike capitalist countries, is inherently opposed to aggressive ambitions and diligently promotes justice, peace, and friendship among all nations. Soviet foreign policy (its founders were Lenin and Stalin) is entirely based on new principles. It is characterized by its unwavering struggle for lasting democratic peace and the security of all nations, exposing warmongers, defending the independence, sovereignty, and genuine equality of all nations, large and small, and protecting their national independence and their rights from the infringements of imperialist bandits.

Lenin said in his Decree on Peace, submitted to the Soviet Congress on November 8, 1917: "The government considers the continuation of this war by the rich and powerful nations to divide the weak nations they have already conquered to be the greatest crime against humanity, and solemnly declares that the government is determined to immediately conclude a peace treaty and stop the war based on the above-mentioned conditions, which are equally just to all nations without exception."

Since then, for more than 30 years, the Soviet state and the Soviet government's struggle for democratic peace has run through the entire history of international relations.

II. Socialist Countries and Capitalist Countries Can Coexist

Soviet foreign policy is based on the assumption that the coexistence of socialist and capitalist countries is natural and will continue for a long historical period. Stalin, Lenin's closest comrade and successor to his great cause, said in 1917: "The idea that the two systems can cooperate was first proposed by Lenin. Lenin is our teacher, and we, the Soviet people, are Lenin's students. We have never, and will never, abandon Lenin's teachings."

The propagandists of American imperialism now assert that Lenin and Stalin held the view that the two systems could not coexist. Imperialist thinkers and propagandists deliberately distort Lenin's words on this issue. It is not difficult to see that they do so in order to justify the fomenting of international conflicts and the preparation of anti-Soviet wars by American imperialism.

Lenin drafted a resolution on the international situation in December 1919 (which was adopted by the All-Russian Party Congress and the Seventh Soviet Congress), which stated that "the Russian Socialist Soviet Federated Republic is willing to coexist peacefully with all nations, concentrating its efforts on domestic construction to organize the production, transportation, and administration of the Soviet system. But this has been hindered so far by the interference and hunger blockade of the Allied Powers."

In November 1920, when the third offensive of the Allied Powers against the Soviet state was crushed, Lenin considered this a great achievement of the Soviet state, saying, "...we have won the conditions under which we can coexist with capitalist countries. They are now forced to establish trade relations with us. In this struggle, we have won the right to exist independently..." "We are now in a new stage, and we have basically won our place in the international relations of capitalist countries."

Later, the foreign policy of the Soviet government, guided by Lenin and Stalin, repeatedly proved that the Soviet people are eager to cooperate with other countries—of course, this cooperation is based on equal footing, not on orders from imperialist countries. In the spring of 1922, Lenin described the policies of British and French imperialism (which were then preparing to blackmail the Soviet Republic in Geneva and force it to accept enslaving economic relations), saying that any attempt to intimidate the Soviet people was foolish and ridiculous. Lenin said: "We have seen the Allied countries, which control almost the entire world, threaten us with guns. We have not been intimidated by these threats. European diplomats had better not forget this."

These words, spoken by Lenin more than twenty years ago, are also very relevant to us today. Today, the American imperialists who are striving for world hegemony and their Western European agents are once again attempting to speak to the Soviet Union in tones of command, intimidation, and threat. This attempt failed twenty-seven years ago, when the Soviet Republic's economy was still very weak, and today, when the Soviet Union, thanks to the correct policies of Lenin and Stalin, has become a powerful socialist country, shattered the piratical German imperialism, and saved civilization from fascist barbarism, this attempt has even less chance of success than in the past.

III. Respect the Independence, Sovereignty, and Interests of All Nations

Lenin especially emphasized the need to respect the interests and sovereignty of every nation in international relations. He cited the achievements of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state's nationalities policy as an example, saying: "Our experience has convinced us that only the highest degree of concern for the interests of various nations can eliminate the basis for disputes, eradicate mutual distrust, eliminate the fear of conspiracies, and establish mutual trust, especially between workers and peasants who do not speak the same language. Without this trust, peaceful relations between nations, or the significant development of everything of value in modern civilization, would be absolutely impossible."

But it is precisely this fundamental condition for the development of civilization that is being systematically and increasingly violently undermined by the imperialist reactionary camp. The intellectual and propaganda figures of imperialism declare that national sovereignty is a "stale concept" that should be abolished immediately. These imperialists who are striving for world hegemony take the undermining and destruction of national sovereignty as their slogan, thus undermining and destroying the foundation of peaceful relations between nations. The interference in Greece, the violent attacks on the people of Indonesia and Vietnam, the Marshall Planization of Western European countries, and the heavy interference in the internal affairs of Western European countries are all manifestations of the policy of the American and British imperialist blocs of wantonly trampling on national sovereignty and inciting distrust, hostility, and disputes between nations. The Soviet Union firmly opposes this policy of international reaction; the Soviet Union supports the freedom and independence of all nations and insists on respecting their political, economic, and cultural interests.

IV. The Characteristics and Common Points of the Foreign Policies of Various Imperialist Countries

When Lenin laid the foundation for Soviet foreign policy—a policy of democratic peace and friendly cooperation between all nations—he, on many occasions, deeply analyzed and vividly portrayed the foreign policies of German, British, French, and American imperialism in the first two decades of the twentieth century. He explained the unique points and common points of the foreign policies of various imperialists. Lenin said in a letter to American workers in August 1918: "The German bandits created a record of military bestiality, while Britain created a record of plundering colonies, not only a record in quantity, but also a record in the disgusting hypocrisy of cunning methods." In the same year, Lenin wrote of British, French, and American imperialism: These countries had been "exposed by world history in their true colors. It shows the truth, it is a beast, using the armies of 'free' countries (France, the United States) as constables, butchers, and stranglers to strangle the independence and freedom of small nations."

In later years, ample evidence was provided for the piratical nature of imperialism analyzed by Lenin. Was it not due to the collusion of the American, British, and French to help the German imperialists establish a piratical fascist rule in Germany, and to conquer Spain, Czechoslovakia, and the Slavic nations by military violence? Was it not the golden rain of dollars and pounds that allowed Hitler to ignite World War II, and for the German imperialists to carry out unprecedentedly barbaric military plunder in this war? Are not the American and British imperialists today revealing their desire to use their own armies and the followers of fascist Germany as constables and executioners of small nations?

In the past two or three decades, imperialist pirates have certainly come up with and mastered new methods of aggression. However, the basic methods of intervention tactics by imperialists, which Lenin had analyzed more than thirty years ago, are still applicable today, only with some changes in style. In July 1918, Lenin compared the tactics of frontal attack by the German imperialists with the tactics of the British colonialists, saying: "The British military power, mainly colonial and naval, for decades, this fact has made Britain advance in different ways in the war of conquering other countries, mainly trying to cut off the supply lines of the country it attacks, and prefers to use aid, disguised, strangling methods, rather than direct, fierce and drastic military suppression."

Today, British imperialists use this method of "aid" and "strangulation" as a form of intervention strategy in East Arabia, Palestine, India, Iran, Ceylon, and Africa. But since Britain has weakened, the honor of using this method has gone to the United States.

The method of strangulation disguised as aid has become the main method of American expansion in recent years. The Marshall Plan's noose is tightly around the necks of Western European countries.

In 1918 and 1919, when the British, French, and American imperialists claimed that they wanted to make the world war for democratic and just peace, Lenin mercilessly exposed their great deception. He pointed out that what American imperialism and its European agents were really planning was not a democratic peace, but a piratical peace of plunder, and pointed out that they had become the stranglers of the freedom of all European countries. "They strangled the Austrian revolution, they assumed the role of constables, they sent a book of mourning to Switzerland: If you don't fight the Bolshevik government with us, we won't give you bread. They declared to the Netherlands: Don't dare to recognize the Soviet envoy, otherwise—a blockade. They only have one weapon, very simple—the rope of hunger."

Since then, American imperialists have played an increasingly important role as a reactionary force in international affairs. After the Treaty of Versailles, American imperialists, in collusion with British monopoly capitalists, first diligently restored the military industrial potential of German imperialism, and tried their best to direct German aggression eastward, against the Soviet Republic. Today, in a new situation, they are restoring German militarism again as a weapon against the Soviet Union and against democracy. American imperialism's hatred for the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and its hatred for everything progressive and democratic, is even greater than it was thirty years ago. They openly support the most reactionary forces in the world, including the murderer Franco and Hitler's disciples and grandchildren in Germany itself.

Lenin pointed out the organic link between imperialism, militarism, and the development of reaction: "Imperialism, that is, monopoly capitalism, only finally matured in the twentieth century, and due to its basic economic nature, it is characterized by no connection with peace and freedom, but by the most extensive development of militarism throughout the world."

Recent history has fully confirmed Lenin's analysis. Based on this analysis, Soviet foreign policy under Stalin's leadership has consistently and tirelessly exposed the growth of militarism and reactionary forces, and has strived to unite the world's progressive forces to resist warmongers, and has pointed out effective ways to fight against the threat of war and the growth of militarism.

V. We Must Be Prepared

When Lenin analyzed the policies of imperialist countries, he warned us that the Soviet Republic, after the end of the civil war and international intervention, entered a new stage of international relations, which would not eliminate the threat of war from imperialist bandits.

"We must not say," Lenin warned at the end of 1920, "that we have a guarantee that there will be no war. ... Now we have taught some great powers to stop fighting us. But we don't know how long. We must be prepared. If the situation changes slightly, the imperialist bandits will come and fight us again."

As history has shown, even after the failure of the intervention in 1918-20, the imperialist camp did not abandon the idea of ​​eliminating the Soviet socialist state by force. The Soviet people have not forgotten this for a minute. On the one hand, the Soviet Union is always ready to deal with the threat of war with all its arms, and at the same time, it never ceases to call on other countries to take effective collective measures to prevent war. In the 1920s and 1930s, only the Soviet Union, under the leadership of Stalin, the great successor of Lenin's cause, consistently fought against the threat of aggression from the Hitler Axis countries. Soviet foreign policy advocated collective security, exposed aggressors, strived for the maximum reduction of armaments, and tried its best to promote the organization of collective resistance to aggression at the League of Nations meetings.

In 1936, the Soviet government, through Molotov, warned the governments and nations of all countries that "the threat of world war continues to increase and spread throughout Europe." But the rulers of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, who were then raising the fascist wolf to attack the East and the Soviet Union, refused to take any steps to prevent the disaster of war. In this situation, the Soviet government unswervingly followed the policies of Lenin and Stalin, increasing the strength of the Soviet state to the highest degree, so that the Soviet Union could later crush Hitler's army and state.

VI. Two Camps, Two Foreign Policies

The goal of Soviet foreign policy in World War II was to consolidate the anti-Hitler alliance, and after defeating the Axis countries, to ensure a lasting democratic peace and to establish a strong and effective United Nations organization.

All nations around the world are extremely concerned about this policy of ensuring universal democratic peace and ensuring the security and friendly cooperation of all countries. But the rulers of Britain, especially the United States, have taken a completely opposite approach, and are imitating the German bandits in trying to seize world hegemony. They are frantically expanding their armaments, frantically searching for followers to conduct a new world war, they have established "Western European," "Atlantic," and other military blocs, and they are reviving piratical German militarism. They are trying to bribe Western European countries and threaten the Soviet Union and the people's democracies with atomic warfare. But their adoption of this approach is bound to suffer, even more than their German predecessors suffered. The people of the world and of Europe have not failed to learn lessons from the two world wars.

The Russian Socialist Revolution in October 1917 was the first and most violent crack in the imperialist front. At the end of World War II, several Central and Southeast European countries were also liberated from the shackles of imperialism. The people of these countries, whom the Soviet army liberated from fascist aggression, have established new, people's democracies and are victoriously marching along the great road of socialism. Now, the imperialist camp faces a strong and powerful, democratic, anti-imperialist camp, which is led by the Soviet Union and supported by millions of working people around the world. Undoubtedly, this camp will continue to grow in both quantity and strength, while at the same time, the evil forces of aggression and war in the imperialist bloc are becoming increasingly isolated.

VII. Open Diplomacy, Frank Diplomacy

Lenin pointed out in 1919 and 1920 that Soviet foreign policy has won the sympathy and support of the working people of other countries.

Since then, the support of broad strata of people in all countries for Soviet foreign policy has increased immeasurably. The vast majority of people in the world support the Soviet policy of peace and national friendship, and oppose the policies of warmongers. This sympathy and support has become a huge historical force, one of the fundamental factors in current international relations. Throughout the entire period of the existence of the Soviet state, its hallmark has been its prestige and the continuous growth of its diplomatic prestige.

Soviet diplomacy is for the benefit of the working people, it speaks not only to governments, but also to the people; it is characterized by its Bolshevik loyalty to principles and by its deep, truly scientific analysis of the political situation. Lenin said in 1920: "Bourgeois diplomacy cannot understand the frank and straightforward method that is unique to our new diplomacy." "This old world has its old diplomacy, it does not believe that frankness and straightforwardness are possible."

For thirty years, in this regard, the reactionary rulers have learned very little, but the lessons given to the people have been many, and the people listen to the speeches of Soviet Leninist-Stalinist diplomacy, which directly exposes the enemies of peace and the conspiracies of the new aspirants to world hegemony.

Lenin especially emphasized that diplomatic policy needs to be so frank when the international situation is tense. He wrote: "Whenever our international relations begin to become tense, we believe that it is necessary to say this publicly and to explain the ins and outs of the matter plainly."

Soviet foreign policy unswervingly adheres to the Leninist-Stalinist principle of warning everyone in a timely manner of the dangers threatening the people.

VIII. Victory Will Surely Belong to Us

In 1922, Lenin and Stalin talked about the direction of the Soviet Russian foreign policy and the imperialists surrounding the Soviet state, saying: "They are greedy and hate each other. They will fight each other themselves, we don't have to worry. Our road is steady, we advocate peace and harmony, and oppose slavery and agreements with slavery clauses. We must firmly grasp our direction and not be deceived by boasting or intimidation."

The history of the past thirty years has fully confirmed the correctness of the Leninist and Stalinist foreign policies. Stalin, the great helmsman of the powerful Soviet state, firmly grasped the helm, guiding the Soviet state's foreign policy along the only sure path, and this railway guides the cause of progressive humanity to overcome the forces of imperialist plunder.

　　列宁与苏联外交政策
    佛朗采夫著  陈佩明译
    要了解当前的国际问题，必须懂得苏联外交政策。苏联的外交政策与资本主义国家的外交政策有本质上的差异：建筑在人剥削人的制度上的资本帝国主义国家，其外交政策只能是向外扩张的侵略政策；反之，废除了人剥削人的制度的社会主义国家，其外交政策必然是民主的和平与友谊的合作之政策。不懂得此一本质的差异，就不能理解今日存于在两大阵营（一方面是苏联、东欧新民主主义国家、殖民地半殖民地人民、与全世界劳动人民，另一方面是资本帝国主义国家及其走狗）之间的各种斗争。
    佛朗采夫在此文中阐述列宁关于外交政策的宝贵教训：第一，反对一切侵略战争；第二，尊重一切民族的独立、主权、和利益；第三，社会主义的国家与资本主义的国家可以并存；第四，必须准备随时对付帝国主义强盗的进攻；第五，公开的外交，尤其当国际关系紧张时必须公开坦白向各国人民说出事情的真相。这些原则，就是十月革命后的俄国政府所一贯奉行而取得了伟大胜利的外交方针。
    以马列主义为行动指南的中国共产党人与非党布尔塞维克，更必须研究和精通列宁的关于外交政策的基本原则。　　　　编者注
　　一、反对帝国主义强盗的侵略战争
    伟大的标志着世界历史转捩点的十月社会主义革命，深邃地改变了整个国际关系的体系。一个苏维埃社会主义国家建立起来了，这是此类国家中的第一个。这国家不同于资本主义的国家，它在本质上是反对侵略的野心，而孜孜推行各民族间的正义、和平与友谊。苏联的外交政策（它的奠立者是列宁与斯大林），完全建立在新的原则之上。它的特点是毫不动摇地争取持久的民主的和平与各个民族的安全，揭发战争贩子，保卫一切大小民族的独立、主权与真正的平等，并保护他们的民族独立，他们的权益，使其不受帝国主义强盗的侵害。
    列宁一九一八年十一月八日在向苏维埃代表大会提出的和平法令中说：“本政府认为继续进行这一富强民族为分割他们业已征服了的弱小民族的战争，是对人类的莫大罪恶，并郑重申明：政府决心立即根据上述条件缔结和约，停止战争，这些条件对一切民族是毫无例外地同样公正的。”
    从此，三十多年来，苏维埃国家与苏维埃政府的争取民主的和平之斗争，贯串着整个国际关系史。
　　二、社会主义国家与资本主义国家可以并存
    苏维埃国家的外交政策建立在这样一个假定之上，即，社会主义国家与资本主义国家之并存是自然的，并将在历史的长时期中继续着。列宁的最亲密的伙友及其伟大事业的继承者斯大林在一九一七年说：“两种制度可以合作的观念，最初是由列宁提出的。列宁是我们的导师，我们，苏联人民，是列宁的学生。我们决没有，亦不会背弃列宁的教训。”
    美帝国主义的宣传人员现在肯定说，列宁与斯大林所抱持的观点是认为两种制度不可能并存。帝国主义的思想家与宣传家有意歪曲列宁关于这个问题的话。不难看到，他们之所以如此，是为要替美帝国主义煽起国际冲突与准备反苏战争申辩。
    列宁在一九一九年十二月起草了一个关于国际情势的决议（该决议为全俄罗斯党代表会议及第七次苏维埃代表大会通过），其中说“俄罗斯社会主义苏维埃联邦共和国愿意与各民族和平共存，集全力于国内建设，以组织苏维埃制度的生产、运输与行政。但迄今为止，受协约国干涉与饥饿封锁所阻挠。”
    在一九二○年十一月，当协约国对苏维埃国家的第三次进攻被粉碎时，列宁认为这是苏维埃国家的伟大成就，称·“……我们已经赢得我们能与资本主义国家并存的条件。他们现在被迫与我们建立贸易关系。我们在这一斗争过程中，已赢得独立生存的权利……。”“我们现处于一个新的阶段，在资本主义国家的国际关系中，我们已基本争得存在地位了。”
    以后，由列宁与斯大林指导的苏维埃政府的外交政策，无数次地证明苏维埃人民是期望与其他国家合作的，——当然，这种合作是建立在平等地位上，而不是由帝国主义国家命令。一九二二年春，列宁描写英法帝国主义者的政策（当时他们正准备在日内瓦敲诈苏维埃共和国，强其接受奴役的经济关系）说，任何恫吓苏维埃人民的企图都是愚蠢可笑的。列宁说：“控制几乎整个世界的同盟国家，以枪炮威胁我们，我们已看到的。我们并未被这些威胁所吓倒。欧洲的外交家们，最好不要忘掉这件事。”
    列宁在二十多年以前说的这些话，对我们今天亦非常合适。今天，争取世界霸权的美帝国主义者及其西欧的代理人，重又企图用命令、恫吓与威胁的腔调对苏联说话。这种企图在二十七年前，当苏维埃共和国的经济还很嫩弱的时候就已失败了，而今天，当苏联由于列宁与斯大林的正确政策，成为强大有力的社会主义国家，击碎了海盗式的德帝国主义，并把文明从法西斯的野蛮主义拯救出来时，这种企图成功的机会就比过去更少。
　　三、尊重一切民族的独立、主权、利益
    列宁特别强调在国际关系中必须尊重每一民族的利益及其主权。他以布尔塞维克党与苏维埃国家的民族政策之成就为例说：“我们的经验使我们坚信，只有最高度的关心各个不同民族的利益，才能扫除争端的基础，铲除相互之间的不信任，消灭对于阴谋诡计的恐惧，而建立相互信任，特别是在语言不通的工人农民之间，没有这一信任，则各民族之间的和平关系，或现代文明中一切有价值的东西之重大发展，都绝不可能。”
    但恰恰是这一文明发展的根本条件，受到帝国主义反动阵营的有系统而日益强横地破坏。帝国主义的思想的与宣传的人物，宣称民族主权是“陈腐的概念”，应该马上废止。这些争做世界霸主的帝国主义者们，以损害及破坏民族主权为他们的口号，因是瓦解了与毁坏了各民族之间和平关系的基础。对希腊的干涉、对印度尼西亚与越南人民的暴力进攻、把西欧各国马歇尔计划化、大加干予西欧各国的内政、都是美英帝国主义集团所推行的肆意践踏民族主权、煽动各民族间不信任、敌对与争执之政策底表现。苏联坚决反对这种国际反动的政策；苏联支持一切民族的自由独立，并坚持尊重其政治的、经济的与文化的利益。
　　四、各个帝国主义国家的外交政策的特点及其共同点
    列宁在奠立苏联外交政策——民主的和平与各民族间友谊合作的政策——的基础时，在许多场合，深刻分析并生动刻画了二十世纪头二十年中德、英、法、美帝国主义的外交政策，他说明各个帝国主义外交政策的特异点及其共同点。列宁在一九一八年八月致美国工人信中说：“德国匪帮创造了军事兽行的记录，而英国则创造了掠夺殖民地的记录，不仅是数量的记录，而且是令人作呕的伪善之狡猾方式的记录。”同年，列宁在写英、法、美帝国主义时说：这些国家曾经“被世界历史揭露得原形毕露。它现出真相来，是一条野兽，用‘自由’国家（法、美）的军队为扼杀弱小民族独立与自由之宪兵、屠夫与绞杀者。”
    在以后一些年头里，对于列宁所分析的帝国主义的这种海盗性质，提供了充分的证据。难道不是由于美、英、法狼狈为奸的援助，使德帝国主义者在德国建立了海盗式的法西斯统治，并以军事暴力征服了西班牙、捷克、与斯拉夫民族吗？难道不是美元与金镑的黄金甘霖，使得希特勒燃起第二次世界大战、使德帝国主义者在此次战争中进行空前的野蛮的军事掠夺吗？难道今天的美英帝国主义者不是显露其渴望用他们自己的军队与法西斯德国的跟班来作弱小民族的宪兵与刽子手吗？
    在以往二、三十年内，帝国主义海盗当然已经想出了、并精通了新的侵略方法。但是，帝国主义者干涉策略的基本方法，列宁在三十多年前所已分析过的，却在今天依然适用，只是花样上有一些改变。一九一八年七月，列宁把德帝国主义者的正面进攻的战术与英国殖民地者的战术作比较说：“英国的军事力量，主要是为殖民地的及海军的，几十年来，这一事实，使得英国在征服他国的战争中，以不同的方法推进，主要是企图切断其所攻击的国家的供应线，并喜欢用援助的、伪装下的、绞杀的方法，而不是用直截了当的、凶猛剧烈的军事镇压的方法。”
    今天，英帝国主义者在东阿剌伯、巴力斯坦、印度、伊朗、锡兰与菲洲等地运用这种“援助”的方法及“绞杀”的方法，作为干涉的策略的形式。但由于英国已经削弱，运用这种方法的荣誉已归美国了。
    以援助作伪装的绞杀的方法，已成为以往几年来美国扩张的主要方法。马歇尔计划的绞绳紧绕着西欧国家的颈＠。
    在一九一八与一九一九年，当英、法、美帝国主义者宣称他们要以民主的正义的和平为世界战争之目的时，列宁毫不留情地揭穿他们的大欺骗。他指出美帝国主义及其欧洲代理人所实在谋划的，并非民主的和平，而是海盗式的掠夺的和平，并指出他们已经变成一切欧洲国家的自由之绞杀者。“他们绞杀奥地利革命，他们担负宪兵的角色，他们向瑞士提哀的美顿书：你不同我们一道打布尔塞维克政府，我们就不给你面包。他们向荷兰宣称：不要妄敢承认苏维埃使节，否则——封锁。他们的武器只有一个，很简单，——饥饿的绳索。”
    从那时起，美帝国主义者已经在国际事务中作为一个反动力量，担负起日益重要的角色。凡尔赛和约之后，美帝国主义者会同英国垄断资本家，初而孜孜恢复德帝国主义的军事工业的潜在力，竭力指使德国的侵略向东发展，以反对苏维埃共和国。今天，在新的情况下，他们又在恢复德国军国主义，来作为反对苏联、反对民主的武器。美帝国主义对于苏联与人民民主国的憎恨，对于每一件进步的与民主的事物之憎恨，比三十年前更甚。他们公开支持世界上最反动的力量，包括杀人犯弗朗哥与在德国本国的希特勒的徒子徒孙。
    列宁指出帝国主义与军国主义及反动底发展之间的有机的联系：“帝国主义，即，垄断资本主义，仅在二十世纪才最后成熟，由于其经济的基本本质，它的特点是与和平自由没有联系，而是最广泛地在世界各地发展军国主义。”
    近来的历史已充分证实列宁的分析。依据这样一种分析，在斯大林领导下的苏维埃外交政策，始终不懈地揭露军国主义与反动势力的生长，而努力团结世界进步力量抵抗战争贩子，并指出向战争威胁与军国主义生长作斗争的有效办法。
　　五、我们必须准备着
    列宁分析帝国主义国家的政策时警告我们说：苏维埃共和国在内战与国际干涉结束以后进入国际关系的新阶段，这，决不会消除来自帝国主义强盗的战争威胁。
    “我们决不能说，”列宁在一九二○年末警告说，“我们已经有不会发生战争之保证。……现在我们已经教训了一些大国，叫他们停止对我们作战。但究竟能多久我们不知道。我们必须准备着。情势稍有变化，帝国主义强盗们会再来打我们的。”
    正如历史所表明的，即便是在一九一八—二○年的干涉失败之后，帝国主义阵营并未放弃武力消灭苏维埃社会主义国家的念头。苏维埃人民一分钟亦没有忘记这一点。苏联在一方面随时准备以全付武装来对付战争的威胁，同时又决不停止地号召其他国家采取有效的集体的防止战争的办法。在二十年代与三十年代，只有苏联一个国家，在列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林的领导之下，始终与希特勒轴心国家的侵略威胁相搏斗。苏维埃外交政策主张集体安全，揭露侵略者，争取最大限度地缩减军备，并在国际联盟会议上竭力提倡组织集体抵抗侵略。
    一九三六年，苏维埃政府经由莫洛托夫向各国政府及各民族提出警告说：“世界大战的威胁继续增涨且波及全欧洲。”但当时正在豢养法西斯恶狼向东方与苏联进攻的英、法、美等国的统治者，拒绝采取任何步骤来阻止战争的灾祸。在这种情况下，苏维埃政府毫不动摇地遵循列宁与斯大林的政策，增加苏维埃国家的力量至最高度，使苏联在后来能粉碎希特勒的军队与国家。
　　六、两个阵营，两种外交政策
    苏维埃外交政策在二次大战中的目标，是巩固反希特勒的联合，以及在战胜轴心国家后，保证有一个持久的民主的和平、和建立一个强大有效的联合国组织。
    世界各地的一切民族，对于保证普遍的民主的和平以及保证一切国家的安全与友谊合作的这种政策，都极表关心。但是英国的，特别是美国的统治者，则完全采取相反的方针，并正效法德国强盗图夺世界霸权。他们在疯狂地扩充军备，病热似地寻觅进行新的世界战争的跟班，他们成立了“西欧”、“大西洋”与其他的军事集团，并使海盗的德国军国主义复活。他们企图贿赂西欧国家，用原子战威胁苏联与人民的民主。但他们采取这种方针必然会遭殃，比他们的德国先辈所遭受的更大。世界的与欧洲的人民，并不是没有从两次世界大战学到教训的。
    一九一七年十月俄国社会主义革命，是帝国主义战线的第一个、亦是最剧烈的一个裂口。第二次世界大战结束，若干中欧与东南欧国家亦同样解脱了帝国主义的锁链。这些国家的人民，苏维埃军队把他们从法西斯侵略下解放出来，已经建立了新的、人民的民主，并且正在胜利地循着社会主义的大道迈进。现在，帝国主义阵营面对一个坚强有力的、民主的、反帝国主义的阵营，这个阵营是由苏维埃领头、而有全世界千百万劳动人民的支持。无疑地，这个阵营无论其数量或力量都将继续增长，而同时，帝国主义集团侵略与战争的恶势力，则日趋孤立。
　　七、公开的外交，坦白的外交
    列宁在一九一九与一九二○年指出，苏联外交政策获得其他国家劳动人民的同情与支持。
    从那时起，苏联外交政策受到一切国家的广大阶层人民的拥护之增加，无可胜计。世界上绝大多数人民赞成苏联的和平与民族友谊的政策，而反对战争贩子的政策。这种同情与支持，已变成一个巨大的历史的力量，成为目前国际关系中的根本因素之一。在苏维埃国家存在的整个时期中，它的标志就是它的威信及它外交威信之不断增长。
    苏联的外交是为着劳动人民的利益，它不只是对各国政府讲话，而且亦是对人民讲话；其特点是它对于原则有布尔塞维克的忠实，及对政治形势有深刻的、真正科学的分析。列宁在一九二○年说：“布尔乔亚的外交不能理解我们新外交所特有的坦率直言的方法。”“这个旧的世界有其旧的外交，不相信坦白直言是可能的。”
    三十年来，在这一方面，反动统治者们所学得的很少，但给人民的教训却很多，人民倾听苏联的列宁—斯大林外交的讲话，这些讲话直截了当地揭露和平的敌人以及新的想当世界霸主者的阴谋诡计。
    列宁特别强调，在国际情势紧张时，外交政策需要如此坦白。他写道：“每当我们的国际关系开始紧张时，我们认为必需公开说出这一点，并把事情原委平白讲出来。”
    苏维埃外交政策毫不动摇地奉行列宁—斯大林的原则，及时地把威胁人民的危险警告大家。
　　八、胜利必然是属于我们
    列宁在一九二二年与斯大林谈到苏维埃俄罗斯外交政策的方向、及包围苏维埃国家的帝国主义者时称：“他们贪得无厌并相互憎恨。他们自己会打起来的，我们不用着急。我们的道路是稳妥的，我们主张和平与和谐，而反对奴役与有奴役条款的协定。我们必须坚决掌握住我们的方向，不被吹牛拍马或威胁恫吓所欺。”
    以往三十年的历史充分证实列宁与斯大林外交政策的正确。强大的苏维埃国家的伟大舵师斯大林紧握着舵，把苏维埃国家的外交政策循着唯一稳妥的道路驶进，这铁路导引进步的人类底事业战胜帝国主义掠夺力量。
