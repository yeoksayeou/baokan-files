　　The Difference Between "State-Owned Enterprise" and "Public Enterprise"

　　Editor: I often see "state-owned enterprises" and "public enterprises" in the newspaper. What is the difference between the two? Please explain.

　　Wu Xiuwen

Mr. Wu Xiuwen: "State-owned enterprises" refers to enterprises under the direct management of the Central People's Government (now, enterprises directly managed by the North China People's Government are also customarily called state-owned) in relation to local enterprises. "Public enterprises" refers to enterprises invested and managed by the People's Government, whether they belong to the central government, provinces, cities, or counties, in relation to private enterprises.

　　“国营企业”与“公营企业”的区别
    编辑先生：我经常在报上看到“国营企业”和“公营企业”，究竟二者有什么区别呢？请解答。　　　　武修文武修文君：“国营企业”系对地方企业而言。中央人民政府直接经营的企业谓之国营（现在习惯上华北人民政府直接经营者亦称国营）。“公营企业”系对私营企业而言。凡人民政府所投资经营的企业，不论其属中央及省、市、县等，皆可称为“公营企业”。
