National Youth Congress Day 5
Representatives from All Sectors Speak
Principles for Electing National Committee Members Adopted

[By Our Newspaper] The First National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation entered its fifth day (May 8th). At the meeting, representatives from the Navy, academia, the press, and industry spoke one after another, calling on Chinese youth to work hard to participate in the military and cultural construction of the New Democratic China. The congress first approved Comrade Feng Wenbin's proposal to add Wang Yizhen, a youth representative of the People's Liberation Army Navy, to the presidium. During the representatives' speeches, young General Zhang Xuesi pointed out that the "Chongqing" warship's uprising pointed out the only bright path for the Kuomintang Navy. He called on Chinese youth to actively participate in naval construction to consolidate the national defense of New China. Following this, Wang Yizhen, the 23-year-old chairman of the Soldiers' Liberation Committee of the "Chongqing" warship, reported amidst continuous applause that the patriotic youth of the "Chongqing" warship, fearless of danger, resolutely raised the banner of righteousness in the enemy's heartland - the Wusongkou - and threw themselves into the embrace of the people. He loudly and firmly said: "Although American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, sank the 'Chongqing' warship, the entire Kuomintang Navy will be transformed into the People's Navy. We Chinese youth will work even harder to build a strong People's own Navy." Mr. Shen Zhiyuan, a representative from academia, pointed out in his speech that today's academic workers must integrate with the workers and peasants and combine science with China's specific environment. Journalist Peng Zigang, based on her personal experience, explained the persecution of the press by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, in the liberated areas, the press has ample opportunities for development. She also represented journalists who had worked in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in expressing their commitment to learning and working to be good servants of the people. Li Huichuan, deputy director of the Harbin Railway Factory, introduced the many scientific achievements of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union that surpass those of capitalist countries, especially the achievements in cosmic ray research. He proposed that Chinese New Democratic scientific workers should learn from the Soviet Union.

Finally, after heated discussions and speeches, three principles for electing the National Committee were adopted: 1. The National Committee shall consist of 109 members, with 99 members elected at this congress, and the remaining 10 seats reserved for representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas that are about to be liberated. 2. There will be 120 candidates. 3. The 99 candidates with the most votes will be elected as members of the committee.

In the afternoon, the meeting adjourned, and all the representatives went boating in Beihai Park and held ball games.

    全国青代大会第五日
    各界代表相继发言
    通过选举全国委员会委员原则
    【本报讯】中华全国青年第一次代表大会进入第五天（五月八日）。会上，海军代表、学术界代表、新闻界代表、工业界代表先后发言，号召中国青年努力参加新民主主义中国的军事、文化各项建设工作。大会首先通过冯文彬同志的提议，即人民解放军海军青年代表王颐桢加入主席团。代表发言中，青年将军张学思指出“重庆号”的起义给国民党海军指出了唯一光明出路。他号召中国青年踊跃参加海军建设，以巩固新中国的国防。接着“重庆号”士兵解放委员会主任委员，二十三岁的王颐桢在不断的掌声中，报告“重庆号”爱国青年不惧危险，毅然在敌人的心腹地——吴淞口高举义旗投入人民的怀抱的情况。他高声坚定地说：“虽然美国帝国主义和他的走狗国民党反动派炸沉了‘重庆号’，但国民党全部海军都要变为人民的海军。我们中国青年更将努力建立人民自己的强大的海军。”学术界代表沈志远先生发言时，指出今天的学术工作者，要结合工农大众，把科学与中国的具体环境结合起来。新闻工作者彭子冈，以她亲身的经历，说明国民党反动派对新闻事业的迫害。而今天在解放区，新闻事业则有充分发展的条件。她并代表过去在国民党统治区的新闻工作者表示今后一面学习，一面工作，做人民的好勤务员。哈尔滨铁路工厂副厂长李汇川则介绍伟大社会主义国家苏联的许多超过资本主义国家的科学方面的成就，特别是宇宙线的研究成就。他提出中国新民主主义科学工作者要向苏联学习。
    最后经过热烈的讨论和发言，通过了选举全国委员会的三个原则：一、全国委员会委员定为一百零九名，这次大会选出九十九名，另外十名留给即将解放的国民党统治地区代表。二、候选人为一百二十名。三、当选委员以票数最多的九十九名。
    下午休会，全体代表往北海划船，并举行球类比赛。
