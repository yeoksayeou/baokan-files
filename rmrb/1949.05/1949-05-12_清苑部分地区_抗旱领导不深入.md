    抗旱领导不深入
    [Hebei Central Electric] Over the past half-month, the Qingyuan County Party Committee has achieved some success in implementing the prefectural committee's instructions on drought prevention and preparations for famine. However, the development of work is still uneven. The seventh, eighth, and ninth districts have been affected by insufficient leadership, which has affected the thorough realization of the increased production plan. In Zhengzhuang Village (representative of the entire district) in the seventh district, almost all the labor force has been invested in irrigated land. At the same time, the dry land is mostly far from the village and the soil is relatively poor, so farmers are unwilling to dig more soil wells. Under such circumstances, it should be organizing farmers to repair old wells, dig new wells, convert small wells into large wells, and buy waterwheels to expand the area of irrigated land. However, the district blindly called for digging soil wells without investigating the actual situation, resulting in setbacks. In the eighth district, four cadres were assigned to three sub-districts, rushing around and simply conveying the message to village cadres. As a result, the district committee did not understand the specific situation and the concerns about increased production inside and outside the Party. It was not until the tense planting season that the district committee realized that most of the 24 villages in the district could not complete the increased production task. The reasons for the above situation, in addition to the seventh, eighth, and ninth districts conducting self-criticism, the county party committee itself also conducted self-criticism, believing that it had made the following mistakes in leadership: First, the leadership was not unified, and the work arrangements were not clear. For example, Comrade Zhao Xiujun from the Public Security Bureau, when holding a meeting in the second district, said to the district and village public security officers: "We are nominally engaged in large-scale production, but in reality, we are doing the business work of our own department." As a result, they left production work and went to conduct gambling arrests and social investigations separately. Second, the plan was not specific enough. For example, the seventh district was not told of its different work content, so it also generally called for well-digging. Third, the problem of seeds was not completely resolved. Fourth, there was insufficient specific leadership and assistance to the district party committee, and the introduction of experience was not timely. Based on the above self-criticism, the county party committee decided to transfer 34 county cadres to form six working groups and go to the cotton-growing areas to intensively lead the digging of wells and water pits. However, do not simply pursue numbers, but mainly mobilize and organize all whole and half labor forces to ensure that people are not idle, waterwheels are not idle, windlasses are not idle, and wells are not idle. And earnestly pay attention to solving the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs and their families.

    清苑部分地区
    抗旱领导不深入
    【冀中电】清苑县委半月来，贯彻地委防旱备荒的指示已获一些成绩。但工作发展还不平衡，七、八、九区由于领导不深入，以致影响增产计划的彻底实现。七区郑庄村（能代表全区）的劳动力，差不多全部投到水浇地去，同时旱地又多是离村较远，土质较次，因而农民不愿再挖土井。在这种情况下，应该是组织农民修理旧井，打新井，小井改大井和买水车，扩大浇地面积；可是该区不调查实际情况盲目号召挖土井，结果碰了钉子。八区四个干部分到三个小区，东跑西奔，只是向村干部传达一下就算完事，因此，区委对具体情况，和党内外的增产顾虑，都不了解，直到进入紧张播种时期，区委才发觉全区二十四个村，绝大部分不能完成增产任务。发生以上情况的原因，除七、八、九各区进行检讨外，县委本身也作了检讨，认为在领导上犯了以下毛病：第一、领导不统一，布置工作不明确，如公安局赵修军同志，到二区召开会议时，对区、村公安员说：“咱们名目上是搞大生产，实际上作自己部门的业务工作。”因而离开生产工作，去单独进行抓赌和调查社会情况。第二、计划不够具体。如对七区，未指出其不同的工作内容，以至也一般化的号召打井。第三、籽种问题解决的不彻底。第四、对区委的具体领导帮助不够，经验的介绍也不及时。根据以上检讨，县委决定抽调县干部三十四人，组成六个工作组，分赴种棉较多的地区，突击领导挖井、挖水坑等。但不要单纯追求数字，主要是发动与组织一切整半劳力，作到人不闲、水车不闲、辘轳不闲、井不闲。并切实注意解决烈军工属的困难。
