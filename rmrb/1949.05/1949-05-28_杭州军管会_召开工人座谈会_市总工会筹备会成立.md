　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th: The Hangzhou Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army convened a symposium of worker representatives on the 20th to exchange views on restoring and developing production and established the Preparatory Committee of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. 175 worker representatives from various public and private enterprises attended the meeting. The representatives recounted the tragic lives of workers in the past, exposed the past behaviors of the "trade unions" manipulated by the Kuomintang in provoking worker disunity and infringing upon worker interests, and provided opinions on the problems that need to be solved in the current restoration and development of production. Tan Zhenlin, Director of the Military Control Commission, stated that the problems raised by the worker representatives would be gradually resolved, and he hoped that the workers would strive to improve their political and cultural level, improve their skills, and establish trade unions and cooperatives that truly belonged to the workers themselves. Director Tan pointed out that the root cause of all difficulties in production was caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries, so it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The attending representatives deeply felt the importance of worker unity, and on the spot, they passed the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and decided to appoint Liu Jianzhong and 34 others as preparatory committee members. Furthermore, the Hangzhou Military Control Commission convened a symposium of more than 60 people from industry and commerce on the 22nd. During the meeting, people from industry and commerce put forward many constructive opinions on restoring and developing production in the future.
