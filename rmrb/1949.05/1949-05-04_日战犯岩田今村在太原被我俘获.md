    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 2nd: Frontline reporter Bing Ru of Taiyuan reports: During our army's annihilation of the Yan bandit artillery prisoner group, we discovered two important Japanese war criminals, Major General Iwata and Lieutenant General Imamura. Imamura, using the alias Jin Shude, served as the commander of Yan bandit's 10th Corps and the commander of Imamura Artillery Battalion. Iwata, using the alias Yu Futian, graduated from the Japanese Army War College and was originally a Major Intelligence Staff Officer in the Japanese Army Command in Shanxi. Both had their hands stained with the blood of the Chinese people. After Japan's surrender, Yan Xishan, a Yan bandit, colluded with Japanese secret service agencies, retaining more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers in Shanxi, along with 6,000 Japanese technicians, led by former Japanese Brigade Commander Lieutenant General Hara Izumi and war criminals such as Iwata and Imamura, to participate in the counter-people's civil war and continue to slaughter the Chinese people. The Yan bandit's 10th Corps was entirely composed of Japanese soldiers. During our army's general offensive on Taiyuan, Japanese invaders Major General Iwata and Lieutenant General Imamura led the Yan bandit's personally trained artillery regiment (the First Artillery Group and the Third Artillery Group of the Imamura Artillery Battalion) to command operations at the Shuangta Temple Wolong Mountain fortress position. Iwata was captured by the People's Liberation Army on April 22nd, and Imamura was captured alive when the People's Liberation Army broke through the city on April 24th. The remnants of the 10th Corps organized by Yan bandits using Japanese war criminals, with the exception of the Datong Independent Regiment, have now been annihilated for the third time by our army. A total of more than 400 Japanese prisoners of war were found this time.
