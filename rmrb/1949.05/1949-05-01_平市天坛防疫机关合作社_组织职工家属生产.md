    Ping City Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Agency Cooperative
    Organizes Production by Staff and Family Members
    [Ping City News] Since its establishment in late March, the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Agency Cooperative in Ping City has not only ensured that staff and family members can purchase food, but has also actively developed production. In the past two weeks, staff and family members have made 500 paper boxes, earning a manual fee of 1.4 yuan per box, for a total of 700 yuan. They made 100 surgical gowns, earning 65 yuan per gown, for a total of 6,500 yuan. They are now preparing to make soy sauce, soap, work clothes for the epidemic prevention agency, paper clips, and a large number of paper boxes and fly swatters. They are also encouraging everyone to raise pigs and chickens. This has not only solved the livelihood problems of some staff and family members, but also saved money for the agency.

    平市天坛防疫机关合作社
    组织职工家属生产
    【平市讯】天坛防疫机关合作社，自三月下旬建立以来，除保证职工家属买到食粮外，更积极的发展生产。近两周中已有职工家属糊成纸盒五百个，每个手工费一元四角，共得洋七百元。做手术衣一百件，每件六十五元，共六千五百元，现又预备做酱油、肥皂、防疫处工作服、纸夹子及大批纸盒、打蝇拍等，并发动大家养猪、养鸡。这样不但解决了一部职工家属的生活问题，且给机关也省了钱。
