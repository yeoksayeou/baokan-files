(Taiyue Dispatch) The 380,000 mu of autumn land in Jincheng County have all completed summer planting before May 5th. Except for 59 villages that suffered partial hail damage on April 30th, with slight losses to seedlings, the seedlings in most villages have emerged from the soil, and sorghum has grown two or three leaves. Due to the high production enthusiasm of the farmers and sufficient preparation, this year's spring plowing and planting work was completed better than in previous years. In previous years, most of the land was plowed once and harrowed twice, and the edges of the fields were rarely carefully repaired; this year, most of the land was plowed twice, and some even three times, and the edges of the fields were neatly repaired. Last year, the most fertilizer applied was 20 dan per mu, while this year the county average was 30 to 35 dan per mu, with the most reaching 70 to 80 dan. The repair of farm tools was carried out quite universally. During planting, the masses in each village universally and automatically formed small mutual aid teams. In addition to the above achievements, the following shortcomings still exist: (1) Fertilizer application is not universal enough, and individual households in individual areas still have "white planting" (planting without fertilizer). (2) The preferential treatment for military families through the "contracted farming" system has not been universally implemented; only 18 villages in the county have started to implement it, and 8 villages have made preliminary achievements. (3) Not enough attention has been paid to the leadership of mutual aid teams. (4) Some county, district, and village cadres believe that: "The masses have high production enthusiasm, and they will produce even without our leadership." The meeting criticized the above shortcomings and erroneous understandings. It was arranged to do a good job in preparing for weeding from May 10th to 25th, and to continue to deeply resolve the preferential treatment for military families through the "contracted farming" method. After the 25th, weeding will begin, and technically, uniform seedling spacing is required.

　　晋城全县完成夏种
    【太岳电】晋城全县三十八万亩秋地，在五月五日以前，已全部完成夏种。全县除五十九个村于四月三十日部分受冰雹灾害，小苗略有损失外，各村苗已大部出土，高粱已长出二、三个叶。由于农民生产情绪高，准备较充分，今年春耕下种工作比前几年都完成得好。前几年大部分的地都是犁一遍、耙两遍，地边堎缘很少认真修；今年大部分是犁两遍，还有犁三遍的，地边堎缘都修得很齐楚。去年最多的每亩上粪二十担，今年全县平均每亩上三十担到三十五担，最多的上到七八十担。相当普遍地进行了修补农具。在下种时候，各村群众都普遍的自动结合起小型互助组。除上述成绩外，还存在下面的缺点：（一）上粪不够普遍，个别地区个别户还有白种的。（二）包干代耕制的优军办法，没有普遍实行起来；全县只有十八个村开始作，八个村作出了初步成绩。（三）对互助组的领导上，没有引起足够的重视。（四）有一部分县、区、村干部，认为：“群众生产情绪高，不领导他们也要生产”。会议对以上缺点和错误认识作了批判。布置了从五月十日到二十五日，作好锄苗准备工作，继续深入解决“包干代耕”的优军办法。二十五日以后，开始锄苗，在技术上要求留苗均匀。
