Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: TASS, Berlin, 4th: As the election of delegates to the Third German People's Congress is approaching, the German youth organization "Free German Youth," together with various democratic parties, jointly issued an appeal to German youth, stating: The Bonn Constitution, the Ruhr Statute, and the Occupation Statute are measures that deprive German youth and the German people of the possibility of realizing peaceful construction nationwide. They turn a part of our country into a colonial appendage of American and British colonialism, thereby incorporating West Germany into countries attempting to launch new wars. The appeal urges German youth to fight for the establishment of a unified Germany and the conclusion of a just peace treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: German News Agency, Berlin: The "Free German Youth" representative congress is scheduled to be held from June 1st to June 4th. The meeting will discuss issues related to the status of the younger generation nationwide, improve youth entertainment facilities, and elect a new Central Committee. After the meeting, a Free German Youth Festival with approximately 100,000 participants will be held.

    告德国青年书
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社柏林四日讯：由于第三届德国人民代表大会代表的选举即将举行，德国青年团体“自由德国青年”特与各民主政党联合发表告德国青年书称：波恩宪法、鲁尔法规和占领法规，是剥夺德国青年和德国人民在全国实现和平建设的可能性的措施。它们使我国的一部分成为美英殖民主的殖民附属国，借此把西德纳入企图发动新战争的国家中。告青年书敦促德国青年为建立统一的德国与缔结公正的和约而斗争。
    【新华社北平七日电】德意志通讯社柏林讯：德国青年团体“自由德国青年”代表大会定于六月一日至六月四日举行。会议将讨论有关年青一代在全国的地位，改善青年的娱乐设备等问题，并将选举新的中央委员会。会议以后将举行约有十万人参加的自由德国青年节庆。
