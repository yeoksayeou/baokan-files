    From Secret Activities to Blatant Actions
    US Imperialism Plots to Incorporate Spain into the Western European Military Group
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 13th] According to various reports: Since the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, passed the reactionary proposal on the 7th that countries "freely handle" diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain, the United States has further and blatantly attempted to incorporate Spain into the Western European military bloc. According to US News Agency reports, at a meeting of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 10th, the committee chairman Connally even stated: "No reason can be found why the United States cannot restore full diplomatic relations with Spain," and requested the mutual dispatch of ambassadors to Spain. Vandenberg, the Republican leader of the Foreign Relations Committee, also expressed the same opinion. On the 11th, US Secretary of State Acheson, when explaining the above remarks at a press conference, openly declared: "The important thing is not whether we should send an ambassador instead of a chargé d'affaires (the United States currently has a chargé d'affaires stationed in Madrid), but what means there are to bring Spain into the group of European 'free nations' in terms of economy and defense," "The policy of the United States is to return Spain to the Western countries group, and this is a military issue." In this way, the conspiracy of the United States to protect Franco's Spain as an anti-Soviet base, which was solemnly exposed by representatives of the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries at the United Nations General Assembly, has been completely exposed. According to the Polish Press Agency, the US and British delegations to the UN General Assembly have recently been exerting pressure on the Danish and Norwegian delegations, forcing them to change their attitude of abstaining on the "countries can freely handle diplomatic relations with Spain" case in the Political and Security Committee, and to vote in favor in the plenary session, so that the case can finally obtain a two-thirds majority in the United Nations General Assembly. Due to the firm opposition of the trade unions and the broad masses of the people in the two countries, the representatives of the two countries have fallen into an extremely embarrassing situation.

    从秘密活动到明目张胆
    美帝正图将西班牙纳入西欧军事集团
    【新华社北平十三日电】据各方报道：自联合国大会政治安全委员会七日在美国操纵下通过各国以“自由处理”与佛朗哥西班牙之外交关系的反动议案后，美国已进一步明目张胆地企图将西班牙纳入西欧军事集团。据美新闻处消息，在十日美国参议院外交委员会会议上，该委员会主席康纳利竟称：“不能发现有任何理由使美国不能与西班牙恢复充分外交关系”，并要求与西班牙互派大使。外委会共和党领袖范登堡亦发表同样意见。十一日美国国务卿艾奇逊在记者招等会上解释上述言论时更公然宣称：“重要的不在于我们是否应派大使而不派代理公使（按美国现有代办驻马德里），重要的在于有何办法能使西班牙在经济与防御方面加入欧洲‘自由国家’的集团”，“美国的政策在使西班牙重返西方国家集团，这是一个军事问题”。这样，苏联与各人民民主国家代表在联合国大会上所严正揭露的美国企图庇护佛朗哥西班牙以为反苏基地的阴谋已暴露无遗。据波兰通讯社报道：联大美英代表团最近正对丹麦、挪威代表团行使压力，强迫他们改变在政治安全委员会上对“各国可自由处理对西班牙外交关系”一案弃权的态度，而在全体大会上投赞成票，以便该案在联合国全体大会最后能获得三分之二大多数通过。由于两国职工会与广大人民的坚决反对，两国代表已陷入极为狼狈的处境中。
