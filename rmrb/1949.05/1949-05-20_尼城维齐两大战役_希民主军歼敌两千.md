Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 19th. The Free Greece News Agency reported: According to a communique issued by the General Headquarters of the Greek Democratic Army on the 17th, the Democratic Army conducted two major operations in the areas of Nion Petritsi and Weiqi. In the battle in the Nion Petritsi area and the eight-day battle in Biers, the royalist fascist army was killed 455, wounded 637, and captured 124. Among the soldiers of the royalist army participating in the offensive east of Biers, incidents of disobedience and refusal to continue the attack occurred, forcing the royalist army commander to hastily withdraw these troops to the rear. The defeat of the royalist army on Height 1694 in Weiqi and in the Kolki Turtulia area also forced the royalist army headquarters to completely reorganize their troops. The enemy's attempt to retake these locations has been crushed. In these battles, as in the particularly significant results of the Grammos area battles in April, the number of royalist officers and soldiers captured by the Democratic Army is increasing daily, with the number of captives accounting for more than 10 percent of the royalist fascist army's losses in these battles. The enemy casualties in the Weiqi battles mentioned above were 176 killed, 496 wounded, and 68 captured.

　　尼城维齐两大战役
  　希民主军歼敌两千
    【新华社北平十九日】自由希腊通讯社报导：据希腊民主军统帅部十七日发出的公报，民主军曾在尼昂·彼特里西和维齐地区进行两次较大的作战。在尼昂·彼特里西地区战区战役和在比尔斯的八天作战中，保皇法西斯军被击毙四百五十五人，击伤六百三十七人，俘一百二十四人。参加比尔斯以东攻势的保皇军的士兵中，发生不服从命令和拒绝继续攻击的事情，迫使保皇军司令匆忙将这些部队撤至后方。保皇军在维齐的一六九四号高地和科尔基突利亚地带的败北，亦使保皇军司令部不得不全部地整顿他们的部队。敌人重占这些地点的企图已被粉碎。在上述维齐地区的战役中，敌被击毙一百七十六人，击伤四百九十六人，俘六十八人。在这些战役中，和在四月间格拉姆斯地区战役中的特别重大的战果一样，就是被民主军俘虏的保皇军官兵数目日益增加，被俘数目占保皇法西斯军在这些战役中损失的百分之十以上。
