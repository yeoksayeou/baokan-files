　　Regulations of the Tenth Sub-district of Central Hebei
　　Overcoming Waste of Civilian Labor Measures
　　[Our dispatch] In order to correct the serious waste of manpower and animal power and the phenomenon of hindering production, the Tenth Sub-district of Central Hebei has made the following regulations regarding current duties: A. The armed forces departments and transportation stations of each county and district will immediately summarize and inspect the current duty situation (mainly mobilization and waste, and illegal mobilization). Their reports shall be submitted to the sub-district before May for correction. B. Strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting. Summarize once a month and report briefly every half month. Any major mobilization duties must have a special report. Regarding the authority to mobilize, any mobilization of more than 30 carts and more than 50 laborers must be approved by the sub-district. Any single mobilization of 100 carts or more than 300 laborers must be approved by the Central Hebei District. C. All major mobilizations shall be carried out by formal orders of the armed forces departments at all levels and joint orders with other agencies. No one may act without orders; otherwise, it will be considered invalid and will be investigated. It is strictly forbidden to mobilize villages directly. Those with mobilization permits must hand them over to the transportation station or the district/county armed forces department in the area for responsible dispatch. D. Immediately and strictly control the daily duty expenditures, greatly reduce duties, balance adjustments, and strictly manage the duty mobilization and miscellaneous support differences between rear agencies and rural villages. All self-used grain and firewood transportation, grinding flour, repairing houses, and picking up family members must be solved by themselves or by hiring. Mobilization is not allowed; otherwise, it will be considered a violation of discipline. E. All mobilization of civilian labor must be carefully calculated and prepared in advance. In order to strengthen the management and education of the laborers on duty and improve efficiency, it is stipulated that those gathering less than 200 people or 100 carts must be led by a district cadre; those above that must be led by a county cadre. F. First of all, the armed forces departments at all levels must re-study the "Duty Regulations" and "Wartime Duty Instructions" in order to correctly implement them; and educate village cadres (especially in new areas) and the masses to clearly understand the policies and rules of duty mobilization, dispel doubts, and concentrate on production, so that anti-waste can be combined from top to bottom to form a mass-based management system. G: Strictly enforce the discipline of saving civilian labor, commend those who save and care about the people's burden, and criticize and even punish those who waste civilian labor. The governments and agencies of all counties and districts should conduct thorough inspections, educate their subordinates, earnestly cherish civilian labor, practice thrift, oppose waste, and strictly prohibit illegal mobilization. In the future, those who violate this will be given appropriate punishment depending on the severity of the circumstances, and the agencies that waste civilian labor will be ordered to apologize to the laborers and compensate for the losses in order to benefit production and construction.
