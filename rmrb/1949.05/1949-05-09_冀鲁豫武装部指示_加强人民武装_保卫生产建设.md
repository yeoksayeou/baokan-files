    Instructions from the Armed Forces Department of Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Strengthen the People's Armed Forces and Defend Production and Construction
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric] In order to stabilize social order and defend production and construction, the People's Armed Forces Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region issued instructions on strengthening the work of the people's armed forces on April 21st. Since the deployment of winter defense and winter training to strengthen public security work last year, various places have achieved considerable success, but in some newly recovered areas, due to the masses not yet being mobilized, hidden Kuomintang special agents, in collusion with local bullies and hooligans, are still constantly carrying out sabotage activities. Therefore, the People's Armed Forces Department has issued the following instructions: 1. Stabilizing social order and defending production and construction are the primary tasks of the people's armed forces at present. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify the work of the people's armed forces, review the militia unit by unit at the village level, raise awareness, expose rumors, dispel ideological concerns, and at the same time, prevent bad elements from penetrating the interior to carry out sabotage activities. If such elements are discovered, they must be resolutely purged through the masses. The self-defense forces must improve their organization and structure, adjust and select cadres. 2. In areas where social order is unstable, the self-defense forces should strengthen sentry posts, the militia should actively patrol, and serious attention should be paid to protecting roads and power lines. The junction of districts or counties should be the responsibility of both sides. 3. In market towns, the public security departments can be assisted in conducting shop inspections. If anyone is found to be suspicious, they should be sent to the district headquarters for processing. 4. The militia's weapons must be determined, registered and properly kept. During public security work, soldiers who have left the team should be actively mobilized to return to the team, and those at home are not allowed to wear military uniforms indiscriminately. Retired soldiers should change the color of their military uniforms as much as possible. The masses are not allowed to wear enemy or our army's clothing. They should be mobilized to hand them over. The issue of militia smuggling must be strictly organized or led directly by cadres. Finally, it is pointed out that if there are unexpected circumstances, the militia must be used centrally, and must be reported for instructions before execution. In addition, in the work of rectifying the people's armed forces, attention should also be paid to the development of the militia, so that the militia becomes a powerful armed force to protect the interests of the people.
