The Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress has just returned to China and has heard the news that the French reactionaries are using all kinds of despicable means to persecute Mr. Curie. All of us feel deeply indignant. We protest against the French reactionaries for carrying out this shameless conspiracy to curry favor with American imperialism. We are deeply concerned about the development of this incident and are willing to do everything possible to support Mr. Curie. In addition to sending a separate telegram to Mr. Curie to express our condolences, please convey our intentions to the French people.
