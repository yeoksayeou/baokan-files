Large Numbers of Cadres Go to the Countryside to Help
　　North China People Fight Drought and Sow Seeds
　　Nearly 90,000 Wells Dug in Three Districts of Central Hebei
Breaking the Masses' Idea of Waiting for Rain is an Important Experience in Leading Sowing
[Report from this newspaper] The drought resistance sowing in North China has achieved significant results, and various places continue to carry out crash programs, paying attention to replanting and protecting seedlings. According to the current known situation, the rainfall is very uneven. Except for the more rainfall in some areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and eastern Hebei, and some areas of Taihang, and Taiyue is not too dry, most other areas are still suffering from severe drought. Most areas in central and southern Hebei have not yet received rain. On April 27th, based on the drought situation in the entire region, the North China People's Government issued an emergency mobilization notice for drought prevention and sowing. The Ministry of Agriculture immediately transferred 16 cadres, along with more than 30 teachers and students from the Agricultural College of North China University, to form a working group. On the same day the notice was issued, they rushed to various places in central and southern Hebei to help promote drought resistance and rush planting work. Party committees and governments at all levels also transferred a large number of strong cadres to the countryside to help farmers dig wells and plant seeds. The "Temporary Assault Team" jointly formed by the Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region of the Southern Hebei District had 1,482 cadres. The Eighth District Committee of Central Hebei also sent more than 400 cadres to the countryside to lead farmers in crash sowing, and clearly assigned specific tasks to each cadre.
    Due to the active leadership of the government, farmers have demonstrated a high degree of labor creativity in drought resistance and sowing. According to incomplete statistics from various places, the rough statistics of 33 counties in the 8th, 9th, and 13th districts of central Hebei show that 88,883 new wells have been dug, which is estimated to guarantee the sowing of 900,000 mu; among them, 120 earth wells were dug in Sidao @ Village, Yongqing County, exceeding the plan of one well per household. At the same time, the machine well drilling team led by the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency also drilled 67 wells in areas along the Pinghan Railway, and used electric motors to pump water, increasing the paddy fields by 33,500 mu. Opening canals has received more attention in drought resistance work. The Hekou Wan Zhang Canal in Huixian, Taihang, has been completed and can guarantee the sowing of 12,000 mu of land. The Dafan damming project in Wuzhi has also been completed, allowing 35 mu of land to be planted with crops. The Jiyuan Yongli River in Taiyue is starting to dig canals, which will turn 35,000 mu of wasteland into highly productive fertile fields; Tunliu has completed the restoration of 15 canals; Meng and Wen counties have also opened a diversion canal each. The completion of the sluice gate repair and canal opening on the North Li River in Ningnan County, Southern Hebei District, has moistened 30,000 mu of land. The canal repair in Jixi area of ​​Chahar province is particularly effective, restoring 171 criss-crossing canals. In addition, the North China Cotton Improvement Office directly helped Tong County install electric water pumps, allowing thousands of acres of cotton fields to be planted in time. This has indeed laid a good foundation for drought resistance and sowing.
    In terms of sowing, most places can proceed according to the planned schedule. The original plan of 1.5 million mu of cotton sowing in Hebei-Shandong-Henan has been basically completed, and efforts are now being made to protect seedlings and realize the plan of sowing 1 million mu of peanuts. According to the current incomplete statistics of the Tenth District of Central Hebei alone, more than 360,000 mu of cotton and more than 15,000 mu of peanuts have been planted. Hejian and Qingyuan in the Ninth District have generally planted millet and sorghum, and completed the task of planting cotton. The Fourth District of Qingxian has sown 1,350 mu of cotton and peanuts, exceeding the original task by 20%, and has also planted a lot of millet and sorghum. Incomplete statistics of 144 villages in 18 counties including Changzhi and Wu'an in Taihang show that more than 200,000 mu of various crops such as cotton, peanuts, millet, sorghum, and yam have been sown by the beginning of this month. The cotton sowing in the first, second and third special districts of Southern Hebei has completed two-thirds, the fourth special district has completed 80%, and the fifth special district has completed one-half, and is still continuing to organize forces to vigorously sow.
    In drought resistance and sowing, farmers actively participate in mutual assistance. For example, in Xiaohan Village, the sixth district of Qingyuan, everyone wanted to dig a well during planting, but a single household could not afford it and asked to dig together, but they were not organized. This time, under the mobilization of Duan Mingqin, secretary of the district party committee, everyone quickly organized themselves naturally, completed the well digging work, and established a mutual aid organization. More than 6,000 groups have been organized in this way in seven counties including Leting in eastern Hebei. According to the general statistics of the Tenth District of Central Hebei, there are more than 322,200 laborers helping each other in sowing, which is beneficial to promoting this year's production movement.
    Several points of experience
    The initial experiences gained in drought resistance and sowing in various places are: First, party members and cadres take the lead and use examples to persuade farmers to dispel all their doubts so that sowing can achieve results. For example, in Ba County, Central Hebei, farmers' thinking of "relying on heaven and waiting for rain" led to a phenomenon of being helpless and bowing to difficulties. Later, the cadres inspired everyone to recall that in 1943, they had overcome the severe drought while fighting and producing in the enemy's layers of blockade. The masses immediately shouted the slogan: "Now waiting for rain and hoping for heaven, there was experience in 1943," which strengthened the determination and belief of every farmer to "carry water to plant seeds" and "man will conquer nature," and made the planting movement flourish. Comrade Li, the chairman of the Farmers' Association in Yongqing County, saw that the farmers in Lijia Village, the fifth district, thought that quicksand sinking their feet was caused by ghosts and dared not repair the well. He went down to the well first to lead the masses to pan, and the result was a complete victory, which made the whole village carry out well digging and planting universally. Beiyuan Village in the third district of Wuji took the branch as the core of leading production, united the masses and freely formed 54 groups, and party members took the initiative to participate in the activities of each group. Therefore, the sound of waterwheels could be heard day and night in the village. On the contrary, some areas only focused on urging numbers, doing less research and running around more, which made well-intentioned urging become a disguised compulsory order, resulting in a thankless effort. For example, a cadre in the eighth district of Dingxing ran to several villages like a horse looking at flowers while leading production, but failed to solve any problems. Some people lacked confidence in production, so they invisibly became the tail of the masses. For example, when a cadre in the first district of Jiaohe went to Beitan Village to mobilize well digging, the masses said: "It won't work to dig wells if it doesn't rain." He himself felt doubtful and wavered, and said with sympathy for the backward attitude: "That's really the case." As a result, there was no achievement in half a month of work. After the county party committee explained and criticized him, he reversed this mistake. This must be paid attention to in future work.
    Second, work must be thoroughly checked to solve practical difficulties. For example, when digging wells in Baiyankou Village, the fifth district of Yongqing, it was very difficult to dig wells in quicksand, and the farmers' narrow-minded empiricism believed that it was impossible to dig at all, which made it impossible to carry out rushing planting. Comrade Liu of the county farm used the method of digging and laying plates at the same time to complete the first one, which made the silent village of production labor like a raging fire. At the same time, all productive forces were mobilized in the sowing process, which solved the difficulty of insufficient driving force. For example, in Leting, eastern Hebei, under the in-depth mobilization of cadres, among the 49,109 female laborers in the county, 43,111 participated in planting, carrying water, and pulling livestock, reaching 90% of the women participating in labor. This is also one of the main keys to the initial victory of this sowing.

　　大批干部下乡帮助
  　华北人民抗旱播种
  　冀中三个分区挖井近九万
    打破群众等雨思想是领导播种的重要经验
    【本报讯】华北抗旱播种现已获显著成绩，各地仍继续突击，注意补种保苗。据目前所已得悉的情况看，落雨的情况，很不平衡，除冀鲁豫、冀东有较多地区落雨，及太行部分地区落雨，太岳不算太旱，其他多数地区仍呈苦旱，冀中、冀南则多数地区迄未落雨。就已落雨地区的情况看，雨量不足者亦占多数。华北人民政府曾于上月二十七日根据全区旱象，发出紧急动员防旱播种通知，农业部立即抽调了十六名干部，偕同华北大学农学院师生三十余名，组成工作小组于发通知同日就分别赶赴冀中、冀南各地，帮助推动抗旱抢种工作。各级党委、政府也纷纷抽调大批能力坚强干部下乡，扶助农民进行挖井点种。冀南区党委、行署、军区联合组成的“临时突击队”，就有干部一千四百八十二名。冀中区所属的八分区，地委也派了四百余名干部下乡，领导农民突击播种，并明确给了每个干部具体任务。
    由于政府的积极领导，在抗旱播种中，农民发挥了高度的劳动创造力，现据各地报导的不完全统计：冀中八、九、十三个分区三十三县的概略统计，就打新井达八万八千八百八十三眼，估计能保证九十万亩的播种；其中永清县四道＠村，就打了土井一百二十眼，超过了一户一井的计划。同时华北水利推进社领导的机器凿井队在平汉沿线等地也打了井六十七眼，并利用电力马达抽水，增加了水田三万三千五百亩。开渠在抗旱工作中更加被注意了。太行辉县的河口万丈大渠业被修竣，可保证一万二千亩地的播种，武陟大樊堵口工程，也已完成，使卅五亩的土地能种上庄稼。太岳济源永利河则正在开始挖渠工作，将使三万五千亩的荒地变为出产极丰的良田；屯留则完成了十五道渠的恢复任务；盂、温县也各开了撤水渠一道。冀南区宁南县在北澧河的修闸开渠，业已完成，三万亩土地得到了水的滋润。察哈尔省冀西一带的修渠尤著成效，修复了一百七十一道交错纵横的水渠。另外华北棉产改进处并直接帮助通县按装了电力抽水机，使千亩棉田及时种上。这，对抗旱播种确实打下了良好的基础。
    在播种上，各地大体均能按照预订计划进行。冀鲁豫原计划的一百五十万亩棉花播种，基本上业已完成，现正在为保苗和实现一百万亩花生播种的计划而努力。冀中仅据十分区目前不完全的概略统计，已种上了三十六万余亩的棉花，一万五千余亩的花生。九分区的河间、清苑已普遍种上谷子、高粱，并完成了种棉的任务。青县四区已播种棉花、花生一千三百五十亩，超过了原任务的百分之二十，同时也种上了不少的谷子高粱。太行长治、武安等十八县一百四十四村的不完全统计，迄本月初已下种棉花、花生、谷子、高粱、山药等各种作物二十余万亩。冀南一、二、三专区的棉花播种完成三分之二，四专区完成百分之八十，五专区完成二分之一，现仍在继续组织力量大力播种中。
    抗旱播种中，农民积极参加互助。如清苑六区小韩村在点种中，大家都想打井，但单独一家挖不起，要求合伙挖，又没有组织习惯，这次经区委书记段明琴的发动，使大家很快就自然的组织起来，完成了打井的工作，建立了互助的组织。冀东因此而组织起来的，在乐亭等七县就有六千多组。冀中十分区的概计，有三十二万二百余劳动力互助点种，这在推动今年的生产运动上讲是有好处的。
    几点经验
    各地抗旱播种中取得的初步经验是：第一、党员干部带头，以实例说服农民，打破其一切疑虑，使播种收到了成绩，如冀中霸县农民因“靠天等雨”的思想，致形成对困难束手、低头的现象，后来干部启发大家回想一九四三年曾在敌人层层封锁中，一面战斗、一面生产下竟也战胜了严重的旱荒时，群众立即喊出：“今等雨明盼天、四三年有经验”的口号，坚定了每个农民“挑水点种”“人定胜天”的决心和信念，使点种运动蓬勃开展。永清县农会主任李同志在五区李家口村看到农民把流沙陷脚认为是鬼拉腿而不敢修井时，他就先下井带动群众去淘，结果获得完全的胜利，使全村普遍开展了挖井点种。无极三区北远村，以支部为领导生产的核心，团结群众自由组合成五十四组，党员主动分别参加每组的活动，因而该村昼夜都可听到水车叮当的声音。相反的，有的地区因干部只注意到催数字，研究少、跑腿多，使善意的督促形成变相的强迫命令，产生费力不讨好的弊病。如定兴八区某干部在领导生产时，一天竟走马看花似的跑了好几个村，而未能解决任何问题。也有的因对生产信心不足，因此无形中当了群众尾巴，如交河一区某干部到北坦村发动挖井时，群众说：“不下雨打井也不行。”他自己感到怀疑不定，跟着也动摇起来，抱着同情落后的态度说：“实在是这么回事。”结果工作半月毫无成绩，后经县委解释批判，才把这一错误扭转过来。这是将来工作中必须注意的。
    第二、工作必需深入检查，解决实际困难。如永清五区白雁口村挖井时，因为流沙地挖井很困难，农民狭隘的经验主义就认为根本不能挖，致使抢种无法开展。该县农场刘同志乃利用随挖随下盘的方法打成了第一个，使生产沉寂的村子如热火朝天般的劳动起来，同时播种中发动了所有的生产力，解决了发动力不足的困难，如冀东乐亭在干部深入发动下，全县妇女劳动力四万九千一百零九名中，竟有四万三千一百一十一名参加点种、挑水、拉牲口，达到百分之九十的妇女参加劳动。这也是此次播种初步获胜的主要关键之一。
