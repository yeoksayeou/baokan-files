The Growth of Huafeng Iron Factory
By our reporter Zhang Rong'an

I. A Miracle

    After enduring a long dark night and shaking off the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, the Chinese working people are creating their ideal happy life with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. This selfless labor enthusiasm is creating miracles everywhere.

    The reporter recently visited the Taihang State-owned Huafeng Iron Factory. In a spacious courtyard, railways crisscrossed and electric wires intertwined. Two three-ton smelting furnaces stood majestically in the center of the yard. It was casting time, and the furnaces spewed blazing flames. The blowers roared, and the molten iron flowing from the furnace resembled a thick red rope, with sparks flying in all directions and golden light ablaze. The casting workers were busily casting the embryos of machines.

    In the spacious and tall machine workshop, countless belts hung vertically and horizontally, and various power machines and machine tools rotated day and night without stopping. The electric saw in the carpentry department emitted a piercing screech. The impact of various machines boomed, deafeningly. When the reporter visited for the first time, even with Secretary Fan's explanation, he could hear nothing. I thought: Who could imagine that such a large-scale machine manufacturing factory grew from a dilapidated motor vehicle and dozens of workers with limited technical skills? Isn't this a miracle?

II.  We are willing to do more to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek

    The predecessor of the Huafeng Iron Factory was a small tool factory, established in 1944 during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, due to frequent warfare and the Japanese blockade, the material conditions in the mountain valleys were very difficult. The entire factory had only one dilapidated motor vehicle and forty or fifty workers. Even under such conditions, they were still able to overcome difficulties to manufacture some textile equipment, cultivate hundreds of textile technicians, and greatly help the rural textile industry in the Taihang area. At the same time, they also repaired some printing presses and paper-making machines, which also played a role in maintaining newspapers in the enemy's rear at that time. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders in 1946, the factory moved to Changzhi and took over several broken machines from the enemy and puppets, transforming it into the Huafeng Iron Factory.

    In October of the same year, because the Kuomintang bandit gang undermined the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and attacked the Liberated Areas, in order to persist in the industrial construction of the Liberated Areas, the factory, with the selfless and heroic actions of all its employees, moved more than 800,000 catties of machinery and materials through cliffs and narrow paths to the deep mountains of Huguan within ten days. Under conditions of extreme fuel shortage, in the freezing cold, the workers riveted and installed power day and night, enabling the factory to quickly resume work and complete 22 motor vehicles in fifty days, at a rate of one motor vehicle every two days. Manufacturing these 22 machines was the factory's unprecedented first. According to the tools and technical conditions at the time, the result was hard to imagine. Some technicians from the Kuomintang-controlled areas thought it was simply a joke, but after all the employees of the factory bravely accepted this task, and completed it with unprecedented labor enthusiasm and creative spirit, even exceeding it by two machines, they were amazed. They thought the Communist Party must have some special methods.

    During the two production increase campaigns from "February 7th" to "May 1st," and from "May 1st" to "July 1st" in 1947, the high level of awareness of the working class in the old Liberated Areas was demonstrated. Under the resounding slogan of "Intensify production to support the front lines and smash the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army to attack and destroy the Liberated Areas," all workers universally and consciously launched movements such as donating voluntary labor and processing work. They added more than 1,600 voluntary work hours. Wang Changqing, a worker in the machinist班, averaged five hours of extra work every day during the movement. Because he worked day and night, he was so tired that his eyes were red, but he still didn't rest. The workers said: We are willing to endure a little more hardship in order to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and build a new Chinese industry.

III. From Four to Fifty-Two Machines

    In the winter of the same year, because the People's Liberation Army victoriously smashed the Kuomintang bandit army's conspiracy to attack the Liberated Areas, and turned itself into a counter-offensive, reaching the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Changzhi, a city of the people, became the people's paradise forever. At this time, for the convenience of work, the Huafeng Factory was ordered to move back to Changzhi, but due to the needs of industrial construction at that time, most of the machines and personnel remained in Huguan, and only four motor vehicles and a small number of personnel returned to Changzhi. Therefore, they encountered the difficulty of not having machines as soon as they entered. It is difficult to imagine a machine factory without machines, especially without a planer, it would be very difficult to make larger machines. Although they had a planer, the higher authorities limited them to moving it away within a month. So they rushed to make a planer. But difficulties arose again. In history, there had never been a case of making the same size machine with the same size machine, let alone a small machine being able to make a large machine, but they were the creators of history. After their painstaking research and overcoming various difficulties, they actually used the same machine to make the same machine, and used a small machine to make a large machine.

    When they were making the planer, they first overcame the difficulties in casting. When casting the planer bed, because there was no crane, more than 120 people from the manager to the apprentices of the entire factory participated in lifting the molten iron furnace. Comrade Jin Kerang, the head of the engineering section, because he personally participated in the casting, the iron fire spewed sparks, and burned his clothes. Some comrades were injured by the burn and stayed in the hospital for recuperation. Comrade Jin Kerang pointed to the two three-ton smelting furnaces now and said: "These are what we recently built with scrap iron. Since we have these two things, not only can we manufacture machines weighing 10,000 catties, but also because these two things are relatively modernized. Although we have already made cranes ourselves, we don’t need to use them on these." Secondly, they studied the difficulty of the same machine not being able to make the same machine, lengthened the bed of the original planer, and lengthened the racks. In this way, not only did they make an equivalent planer with the original eight-foot planer body, but they also made a drilling machine with a body length of fourteen feet. This is an important key to the Huafeng Iron Factory's ability to develop to the present. Now there are three brand new self-made planers in their machine room. From then on, they were able to make all kinds of machines.

    At the same time, in order to overcome the lack of power, they made a 35-horsepower steam engine and a 15-horsepower gas engine. In manufacturing these two machines, they also overcame many difficulties, such as first making a surface grinder to make the flywheel on the gas engine; and first making a steam hammer to make the steam engine. The crankshaft on the gas engine originally required large materials to make, but because there were no large materials, they used five small materials to piece it together. According to the old machine workers here, in the old society, if the capitalists had not prepared ready-made machines and technical conditions, these would be insurmountable difficulties, especially the gas engine, which was not manufactured by many factories nationwide in old China. But they made it under such arduous and persistent efforts to overcome difficulties. In the past year, they have manufactured more than 130 power machines and machine tools, not only equipping themselves, making themselves an iron factory with 52 power machines and machine tools and relatively complete equipment, but also transporting dozens of machines to other factories and mines of different types, equipping other industries in the Taihang area.

IV. I Found the Answer

    Now, they are carrying out a vigorous production campaign. They want to commemorate "May 1st," welcome "July 1st," and celebrate the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan by completing fifty machines in a concentrated effort. During the movement, the new labor attitude of the working class in the Liberated Area factories was fully demonstrated. In order to ensure the completion of the task, the machinist class took the initiative to propose to work in two shifts, day and night. The carpentry class automatically added four hours of processing work every day; the casting class has added more than 540 work hours from January to April. Comrade Zhang Lianbin, the leader of the class, although administratively declared that he was out of production, he worked harder than anyone else. Many workers didn't even bother to eat in order to catch up with the work, and their wives had to bring them food. Improving tools, improving technology, saving raw materials, and reducing costs have become conscious actions of the masses in the movement. As a result of continuous improvement of tools and improvement of technology, the ironworker class has greatly shortened the work process. They used to need 85 work hours to make a surface grinder, now it only takes 48 work hours; it used to take 70 work hours to build a planer, now it takes 52 work hours. They used to make one crankshaft in three and a half work days, now they make one in two days. Pang Liankai, a machinist, shortened the working time of turning steam cylinder liners by 50% after improving the turning tool. In terms of reducing costs, according to the statistics of the 14 motor vehicles recently produced, the cost was reduced by 25.6%. As for the model examples of heroic, tenacious, and selfless actions in the movement, they are too numerous to mention. For example, the deputy foreman of the electrician class insisted on repairing the steam engine despite his illness. Li Jihai, an apprentice in the machinist class, had already been approved to go home to marry a wife, but he automatically didn't go back when the movement started. Zhao Qingchang, an apprentice, was already sick, and he fell as soon as he went out one morning, but he still insisted on going to work.

    Why do they work so selflessly? Pang Liankai, a craftsman, said, "My mother died when I was seven years old, and there was nothing in my family. When I was fourteen, I carried a broken quilt to Shijingshan as an apprentice. I worked as a worker for twenty-four years in the old society, but people scolded us as 'stinky workers' and 'black workers'. We were beaten and bullied. Who treated us as human beings? I have lived for forty years. Only with the Communist Party and Chairman Mao did I become a human being. Why shouldn't I work hard? Chairman Mao has made the decision for me. I must respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production by an inch." Liu Hongxi, a foreman, said: "I worked for the Japanese in Yangquan. The Japanese only asked us to work, but didn't talk about life. Because there was no place to live, I had to run eighteen miles from home to work every day. I had to get up in the middle of the night to walk. A family of four earned one and a half catties of sorghum flour a day. Many workers were stabbed to death by Japanese bayonets or electrocuted by electric wires because they went to work in the dark. Working for the Kuomintang, they gave us six catties of rice a day on the surface, but the price of rice became 360 yuan, and they still gave us 120 yuan per catty. How could we survive? After liberation, with Chairman Mao in charge, everyone looked up to us workers. The houses are supplied by the public, the tap water is supplied by the public, and a family of six can eat white flour every day. The higher authorities have also promoted me to be a foreman. The workers have a home with the Communist Party. To tell you the truth, comrade, I have worked as a worker for ten years in the old society, and I have not done as much work as I have done in these two years since liberation. Ah! I found the answer."

　　华丰铁工厂的成长
    本报记者  张荣安
　　一、奇迹
    中国劳动人民一渡过了漫长的黑夜，摆脱了压迫在他们身上的帝国主义、封建主义的枷锁之后，正以空前无比的劳动热情创造着他们理想的幸福生活。这种忘我的劳动热情，到处创造着奇迹。
    记者最近访问了太行国营华丰铁工厂。在一所宽广的大院落里，铁路纵横电线交错，烟囱耸立天空，两个能装三吨的熔铁炉，庞然大物矗立院之中央。正是翻砂的时候，熔炉烹出＠＠大火，送风机隆隆作响，从熔炉里流出的铁质，象一条粗大的红绳，铁花四迸金光万道，翻砂工人同志紧张忙碌地铸作着机器的胚胎。
    在宽敞高大的机工房里，纵横高悬着无数条皮带，各种动力机工作机，日以继夜旋转不息。木工部的电锯发出刺耳的怪叫声。各种机器的冲击轰隆轰隆使你震耳欲聋。当记者第一次参观时，虽有范秘书的说明，但全然无闻。我想：这样规模宏大的机器制造厂，谁能设想是由一部破烂元车和几十个技术不大熟练的工人发展起来的呢？这难道不是奇迹吗？
　　二、为了消灭蒋介石，多出些力也甘心情愿
    华丰铁工厂的前身是一个小型工具厂，成立在一九四四年抗日期间。那时由于战争频繁日寇封锁，山沟里的物质条件又十分困难，全厂只有一部破烂元车，四五十个工人。就在这样的条件下，他们仍能克服困难制造出一些纺织用具，培养了数百个纺织技术人材，对太行区农村纺织事业帮助很大；同时他们也修理了一些印刷机，造纸机，对当时在敌后坚持办报也起了一定的作用。日寇投降以后，一九四六年该厂搬到长治，接受了敌伪几部破机器，改成了华丰铁工厂。
    同年十月，因为国民党匪帮破坏政协决议，进攻解放区，为了坚持解放区的工业建设，该厂在全体职工奋不顾身的英勇行动下，十天之内把八十多万斤机器材料，通过悬崖峭壁和人行小道，搬往壶关深山中。在燃料极端缺乏的条件下，在冰天雪地之中，工人不分昼夜铆锡炉安装动力，使工厂迅速复了工，并在五十天中，以两天制造一部元车的速度，完成二十二部元车。制造这二十二部机器是该厂破天荒的第一次，按照当时的工具和技术条件，其结果是很难设想的。有从国统区来的技术人员，认为这简直是开玩笑，但在该厂全体职工勇敢地接受了这一任务之后，并以空前无比的劳动热情和创造精神把它完成并超过两部，他们惊奇了，他们以为共产党一定有什么特别办法。
    在一九四七年“二七”到“五一”；“五一”到“七一”的两次增产运动中，表现了老解放区工人阶级的高度觉悟性。他们在“加紧生产支援前线，打击蒋介石匪军进攻解放区和破坏解放区的阴谋”响亮的口号下，全体工人普遍自觉地展开了献义务工和加工等运动。他们先后加义务工一千六百多个。机工班工人王长清，在运动中每天加工平均五个钟点，由于他日夜工作疲劳过度眼圈子都熬红了还不休息。工人们说：为了消灭蒋介石和建设新中国工业，多吃点苦也甘心情愿。
　　三、从四部到五十二部
    同年的冬天，由于人民解放军胜利地粉碎了国民党匪军进攻解放区的阴谋，并使自己转入反攻，打到国统区，长治这一座人民城市，就永远成为人民的乐土了。这时为了工作上的便利，华丰厂奉命迁回长治，但由于当时工业建设的需要，大部份机器和人员留到壶关，只有四部元车和少数人员返回长治。因此，他们一进门就碰到了没有机器的困难，机器工厂没有机器那是很难设想的，特别是没有一部龙门刨，做较大的机器就很困难。虽然他们有一部龙门刨，但上级限期一月就要调走。于是他们就突击做一部龙门刨。可是困难又来了，在历史上，从来没有过同样大小的机器做出同样大小的机器，更不用说小机器能够做出大机器，但他们是历史的创造者，经过他们苦心钻研，克服种种困难，居然就用同样的机器造出了同样的机器，而且用小机器做出了大机器。
    他们在做龙门刨中，首先克服了翻砂中的困难，在铸龙门刨床身的时候，因为没有起重机，全厂上自经理下至学徒，一百二十多人都参加了抬熔铁炉。工务科长晋克让同志，因为亲自参加翻砂，铁火烹出火花四迸，把衣服都烧掉了。有些同志因烧致伤，住到医院里休养。晋克让同志指着现在那两个三吨熔铁炉说：“这是我们最近用废铁制造起来的，自从有了这两个东西以后，不但能够制造一万斤重的机器，而且由于这两个东西设备得比较近代化，虽然已经自造出了起重机，但是在它们身上已经用不着了”。其次他们研究了同样机器不能做同样机器的困难之所在，加长了原来龙门刨的床身，加长牙条，这样不但用原来的八英尺龙门身做出了一部同等的龙门刨，又做出一部身长一丈四英尺的钻床。这是华丰铁厂能够发展到现在的一个重要关键。现在他们机器间里放着三部崭新的自造龙门刨，从此，他们就能够做出各色各样的机器了。
    同时他们为了克服动力的缺乏，自己造出了一部三十五马力的蒸汽机和一部十五马力的煤汽机。在制造这两部机器时也克服了不少的困难，如为了制造煤汽机上的飞轮先造了一部平面元车；为了制造蒸汽机先造了一部汽锤。煤汽机上的拐轴本来需要大料做，但由于没有大料，就用五块小料凑合起来干。据这里一般的老机器工人说：要在旧社会里，如果资本家没有准备下现成的机器和技术条件，这些都是不可克服的困难，特别是煤汽机，在旧中国全国范围内所制造的工厂也不多。可是他们就在这样坚苦顽强不断克服困难下把它造成了。一年来，他们制造出一百三十多部动力机和工作机，不但装备了他们自己，使自己成为一个拥有五十二部动力机、工作机，比较设备完善的一个铁工厂，而且可以数十部机器输送到其他各个不同类型的工厂矿山，装备了太行区的其他工业。
　　四、我找到答案了
    现在，他们正在开展着一个热火朝天的生产运动。要以突击完成五十部机器来纪念“五一”迎接“七一”庆祝南京太原的解放。在运动中，充分表现了解放区工人阶级在革命工厂中新的劳动态度。机工班为了保证任务的完成，自动提出分成昼夜两班干。木工班自动每天加工四个钟头；翻砂班从一月份到四月份已经加了五百四十多个工。该班从工张连宾同志，虽然行政上宣布他脱离生产了。但他比任何人干得都红。有好些工人为了赶活连饭也顾不上吃，还得老婆来送饭。运动中改良工具提高技术，节省原料降低成本，已经成了群众性的自觉行动。铁工班由于不断改良工具提高技术的结果，大大缩短了工作过程。他们以前做一部平面元车需八十五个工，现在只用四十八个工；造龙门刨过去用七十个工，现在用五十二个工。以前他们做拐轴三天半工做一件，现在两天做一件。机工班工匠庞连凯，改良旋刀以后，旋蒸汽瓦缸缩短工作时间百分之五十。在降低成本方面，据最近做出的十四部元车统计，降低成本百分之二十五点六。至于在运动中表现英勇顽强奋不顾身的模范事例是书不胜书的。如电工班副领工带病坚持修理蒸汽引擎。机工班学徒李济海已经请准假回家娶老婆，但运动一开始他就自动不回了。学徒赵庆昌已经病了，有天早晨一出门就跌了一跤但他还要坚持上工。
    为什么他们这样奋不顾身的工作呢？工匠庞连凯说“我七岁上死了母亲，家里什么也没有，十四岁上就一个人背了一条破被子到石景山当学徒，在旧社会里当了二十四年工人，人家却骂咱是‘臭工人’、‘黑工人’，挨打受气，谁把咱当个人看待。我活了四十岁，有了共产党有了毛主席我才作了人，我为什么不好好工作呢？毛主席给我作了主，我一定要响应毛主席的号召生产长一寸”。领工刘鸿禧说：“我在阳泉给日本人做工，日本人光叫做工不叫生活。因为没有住的房子，每天从家里跑十八里地去上工，半夜里就得起来走，全家四口人一天赚斤半高粱面。有好多工人因为黑夜上工被日本人刺刀刺死电网电死了。给国民党做工，表面上一天给六斤米，可是米价成了三百六十元，他们还是按一百二十元一斤给，怎么能够活下去呢？解放以后有了毛主席作主，大家都高看咱工人了。住房子是公家供给，自来水是公家供给，一家六口人每天能吃上白面，上级又提拔咱当了领工。工人有了共产党就是有了家。老实告诉你说罢同志，我在旧社会干了十年工人，也没有解放了这二年做得活多。啊！我找到答案了。”
