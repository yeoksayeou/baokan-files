　　I Think Adopting "Xi" is Better
　　Yu Renlin
　　Regarding the adoption of the millet wage system, I believe there is a need for discussion. The currently recognized development pattern is: First, wage units, whether using millet, "fen," "xi," or price indices, are all temporary transitional measures; once the country is liberated, transportation is convenient, production develops, and prices stabilize, monetary wages and salaries should be adopted. Second, in the future, the prices of agricultural products will rise faster than those of industrial products, and the distance between the two will gradually increase. On the other hand, although the determination of wage and salary units is temporary, this period will not be very short. For the sake of greater rationality and prudence, simplicity and convenience, it is better to use "xi" for calculation. Because the phenomenon of urban wages being higher than rural wages currently exists. In the future development, agricultural product prices will inevitably increase even more, and the gap between urban and rural labor income will widen. This is good in terms of improving the lives of workers, but not good in terms of urban-rural relations. If "xi" is used for calculation, it includes a portion of industrial products (cloth), which is reasonable in the case of imbalanced development of agricultural and industrial products. Although buying cloth is not done in small pieces, cloth is sold every month, and the total "xi" of a worker's monthly wage is not impossible to buy a piece of ready-made material. Therefore, the adoption of "xi" can still take care of more aspects.

　　我认为采用“饻”好
    于任林
    关于采用小米工资制，我认为有讨论的必要。目前公认的发展规律是：一、工资单位不管是采用小米、“分”、“饻”，或物价指数，均是暂时的过渡办法；待全国解放，交通便利，生产发展，物价平稳时，还应采用货币工资、薪金制。二、今后农业产品价格上升会比工业产品上升快，两者距离日益加大，另一方面，工资、薪资单位的确定虽然是暂时的，但这一时间还不会很短。为了更合理与慎重，简易便行，还是采用“饻”来计算为好。因为目前即存在着城市工资高于农村的现象。将来的发展，农业产业价格必将更加提高，因之城乡劳动所得相较，距离更会加大。这样如就改善职工生活来说是好的，如以城乡关系来论就不好。倘采用“饻”来计算，里面包括了一部分工业品（布），这在农业产品与工业产品不平衡发展的情况下，是合理的。虽然买布不是分成若干小块买，但布的售卖是每月均有，一个工人一月所得的工资总“饻”，也不是不能买一件成料。因而“饻”的采用，还是能照顾更多的方面。
