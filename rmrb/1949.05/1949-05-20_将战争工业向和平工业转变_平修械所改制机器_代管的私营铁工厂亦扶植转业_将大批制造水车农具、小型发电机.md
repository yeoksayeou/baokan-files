　　Transforming War Industry to Peace Industry
　　Ping Repair Shops Convert to Manufacturing Machinery
　　Private Iron Factories Under Trusteeship Also Supported in Shifting Production
　　To Manufacture Waterwheels, Farm Tools, and Small Generators in Large Quantities
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] The eight repair shops formerly belonging to the Kuomintang's "North China剿匪 General Headquarters Military Control Commission" before the liberation of Beiping are, in the months following liberation, preparing for or have already begun to shift their production according to the current needs of society. The former Second Repair Shop was taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry after liberation and renamed the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. After its establishment on April 11th, the factory first built a cupola furnace with a capacity of three tons and repaired a 30-horsepower rolling mill, preparing to manufacture agricultural machinery. A prototype 15-horsepower water pump has already been successfully produced. The factory plans to turn 300 semi-finished waterwheels into finished products and to imitate more than ten types of agricultural machinery transported from the Northeast, such as seeders, chaff cutters, seed selectors, cotton gins, cotton carding machines, etc. The Eighth Repair Shop held a meeting of factory administration, employees, work team leaders, and worker representatives on the afternoon of May 12th to discuss the issue of shifting production. Dong Fuqi, the casting team leader, proposed making mining machinery, while worker representative Liu Anzhong proposed imitating tractors. Others suggested imitating or manufacturing flour mills, threshing machines, water pumps, diesel engines, as well as railway equipment, bicycle, and automobile parts. The meeting finally decided to manufacture machinery needed for agriculture and industry, and the factory can officially shift its production in early June. The First Repair Shop has a total of more than 380 employees. At a meeting of section chiefs and other staff members convened by the takeover personnel of the factory on May 6th, the preliminary consensus was that they would specialize in making machine parts for the China Textile Company in the future. The Fourth Repair Shop began to shift its production in May. In addition to continuing to manufacture the unfinished semi-finished firearms from the past, it has begun to repair the factory's own machinery and has produced a small number of tools needed by hospitals. The Third Repair Shop is also preparing to make waterwheels and water pumps, as well as other machinery needed for agriculture and industry. Previously, the First to Eighth Repair Shops were entirely manufacturing military firearms and weapons for the Kuomintang to slaughter the people. After liberation, each shop still had some remaining semi-finished military products, which are still being completed. It is estimated that most of them can complete the shift in production by June. Currently, each repair shop has preliminarily determined a plan for shifting production and has submitted it to the higher authorities for approval.
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] After more than ten private machinery and iron factories in the city that manufactured guns and artillery for the Kuomintang puppet Military Control Commission before liberation were placed under our trusteeship, the Military Control Commission, in accordance with the principle of assisting and developing industrial production, and based on the reports and pledges of each factory's source of assets, announced in early April that the Fifth Repair Shop, including Tongda, Xingji, Xinji Yong, Tongheshun, Tiancheng Xinji, Yixin, Wentongxiang, Yishuncheng, Yongtaihe, Mingde, and Dexiang, eleven private machinery and iron factories, would be returned to their original owners for management, but they were not allowed to continue manufacturing weapons. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in order to take care of the difficulties during the transition period of each factory, specially convened worker representatives and factory owners' symposiums on the 11th and 13th of this month, respectively. The worker representatives expressed on the spot that in order to take care of the difficulties of the capitalists during the transition period, they would re-establish wages based on business conditions, would not force the capitalists to pay the standard wages of state-owned factories stipulated during the trusteeship period, and would strive to produce. The capitalists also expressed that they would try their best to expand their business, expand production, and never dismiss workers on the pretext. At the same time, the Military Control Commission also extended the deadline for collecting various weapons that had not been completed by each factory to the end of July. The factory owners were very excited, and while actively installing unfinished products, they prepared to deliver them in three batches before the end of July. On the one hand, they actively installed unfinished products, preparing to deliver them in three batches before the end of July. On the other hand, they put forward plans for industrial conversion. For example, Tongda Iron Factory decided to develop in the direction of producing agricultural tools, and had reached a preliminary agreement with the North China Water Conservancy Society on the 17th to produce 60 sets of waterwheel pipes and chains on a trial basis, and would continue to order them if the results were good. All 41 employees of the factory were retained. Yixin Iron Factory changed to manufacturing "pencil making machines". The machine drawings had been drawn and the model had been made. After the sand casting work, finished products would be available around August. In addition, the factory planned to use the remaining 15 horsepower of electricity to install three stone grinding flour mills and engage in sideline production. Xinji Yong Iron Factory decided to switch to making universal type casting machines, perpetual type casting machines, and hand-cranked type casting machines. The factory director, Fu Zhenjiang, was originally an expert in manufacturing universal type casting machines. Yongtaihe Iron Factory has already started manufacturing steel files, which sell well. Other factories have also put forward plans one after another, some of which have been converted to making agricultural tools, and some of which have been converted to making electric fans and small generators. Xingji Iron Factory is also experimenting with manufacturing automatic power generation four-wheeled vehicles. The eleven iron factories have been liberated from the constraints of being forced and semi-forced to manufacture crude and unusable weapons and have begun to produce industrial products that are beneficial to people's livelihood.

    【本报讯】北平解放前国民党“华北剿总武管会”所属之八个修械所，在解放后的几个月内，正根据目前社会需要准备或已进行转业。原第二修械所解放后由农林部接收，改为华北农业机械总厂。该厂在四月十一日成立后，首先建造一座容量三吨的冲天炉，修复一部三十匹马力的轧钢机，准备制造农业机器。试造之十五马力之水泵已成功。该厂计划将三百部半成品水车制成成品，并将仿制从东北运来之十余种农业机器，如播种机、铡草机、选种机、轧棉机、弹花机等。第八修械所，于五月十二日下午召开厂内行政、职工会及工班长和工人代表会议，讨论转业问题。铸工组长董福起提出做矿山机器，工人代表刘安中提出仿制拖拉机。也有的提出仿制或制造面粉机、脱谷机、抽水机、柴油机及铁路器材、自行车和汽车零件等。会议最后决定制造农业及工业所需之机器，该厂六月初可正式转业。第一修械所共职工三百八十余人。五月六日在该厂接管人员召集之科股长等三十余人的会议上，大家初步意见是今后专门做中纺公司的机器零件。第四修械所五月份即开始转业，除继续制造过去未完成之枪械半成品外，里工已开始修理本厂机器，并造出一小部分医院所需之工具。第三修械所也正准备造水车和水泵，以及其他农工业所需之机器。按一至八修械所过去完全制造军火武器，供国民党屠杀人民。解放后，各所尚余一部分军火半成品，尚待继续完成。估计大部分六月份可结束转业。现各修械所都初步定出转业计划，呈请上级批准。
    【本报讯】解放前为国民党伪武管会制造枪炮的本市十余家私营机器铁工厂经我代管后，现根据扶助与发展工业生产的原则与各该厂的资产来源报告及具结书，军管会在四月上旬即宣布将第五修械所包括同大、兴记、信记永。同合顺，天成新记、义信、文同祥、义顺成、永太和、明德、德祥十一家私人机器铁工厂退还原主经营，但不许再继续制造武器，市总工会及工商局为了照顾各该厂转业期间的困难，特在本月十一日、十三日分别召开工人代表及厂主座谈会，工人代表当场表示在转业期间，为照顾资方困难，决依据营业情况重新订立工资，不强迫资方发给代管时期所规定的公营工厂标准工资并要努力生产。资方也表示尽量开展业务，扩大生产，绝不借故遣散工人。同时，武管会对各厂未做完的各项武器，亦延至七月底收齐。各厂主十分兴奋，一面积极装置未完成品，准备在七月底以前分三批交清。一面纷纷拟具转业计划，譬如同大铁工厂决定向生产农具的方向发展，已在十七日和华北水利社谈妥初步代制水车管子和练子六十套，成绩良好时再继续订制。该厂职工四十一名，全部留用。义信铁工厂改制“制铅笔机”，机器图样已经绘好，模型亦做好，经翻砂工作后，约八月间即可有成品问世。另外该厂计划利用剩余的十五个马力的电力，按装三盘磨粉机，从事副业生产。信记永铁工厂决定改做万能铸字机，万年铸字机，手卷铸字机，该厂厂长傅振江原系制造万能铸字机的专家。永太和铁工厂则已开始制造钢锉，销路颇佳。其他各厂亦纷纷拟出计划，有的改做农具，有的改作电扇、小型发电机。兴记铁工厂并试验制造自动发电四轮车，十一家铁工厂在被迫和半被迫制造粗糙不堪使用的武器的束缚下已解放出来，开始生产有益于民生的工业品了。（鸣）
