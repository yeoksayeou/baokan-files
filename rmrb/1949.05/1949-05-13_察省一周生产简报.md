Chahar Province Weekly Production Briefing

At present, the production situation in the province can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) In Jianping, Yishui, Pingxi, and parts of Chahanan and Nankou, as well as small parts of Yanbei and Chabei, the general focus is on plowing, sowing, and eliminating wasteland and uncultivated land. Most areas have now been cultivated. For example, in Fangshan First District, there are a total of 23,127 mu of land, of which 16,804 mu have been cultivated, accounting for approximately 73% of the total land. The Nankou sub-district has a total of 290,000 mu of wasteland, and 190,000 mu have been eliminated. Thanks to the attention of the leadership and the creativity of the masses, difficulties such as drought, a shortage of livestock, and abundant wasteland have been overcome. For example, Nankou, based on the climate, mobilized early on for the sale of equipment from mountainous areas to plains, and from non-disaster areas to disaster areas. Yanbei organized people to cultivate, and in the new district of Fangshan in Pingxi, a method of "two rolls and one plow" was adopted for loess land. Early-maturing crops in the waterlogged areas of Pingxi have all been sown. Before the Spring Equinox, more than 20,000 mu of spring wheat had already been planted in Zhuolu, Chahanan. (2) In the northern mountainous areas of Chabei, Chahanan, Yanbei, and Nankou, the task of delivering manure has generally been completed. The plains and southern mountains of the Nankou sub-district have generally prepared sufficient firewood, and most villages in Sihai County have secured firewood for the entire year. Afforestation has generally exceeded the original plan, but there are also some deviations. For example, in Yi County and Laiyuan, the leadership was eager for quick results or resorted to forced orders, resulting in very few trees surviving. Ying County also emphasized collective planting without defining tree ownership, leading some masses to say: "We are planting for the public!" In particular, in the fifth district of Hunyuan, it was required to complete afforestation in three days, resulting in the ground in Xugou Village not yet thawing, and the masses using fire to burn the ground to dig pits. These problems have been inspected and resolved, emphasizing the definition of forest rights, ensuring that every planted tree survives, effectively organizing forest protection, and continuing afforestation during the summer rainy season.

Recently, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting, emphasizing that production must be regarded as the central task overriding everything else, and establishing the core of leadership in production. The current focus of production is on concentrating efforts to rush cultivate land and vigorously develop water conservancy. In areas with recent rainfall, in addition to seizing the time to rush early-maturing crops, the sowing of large autumn crops has begun. Disaster-stricken areas should pay attention to saving resources for disaster relief.

Chabei, Chahanan, Yanbei, and the Nankou sub-district have all received some rain, but the depth varies. In areas such as Lingqiu, the rainfall depth is about three inches. The Provincial Party Committee has urgently telegraphed all areas to rush sowing.

    察省一周生产简报
    目前全省生产，大约可分两种情况：（一）在建平、易水、平西、和察南、南口的一部地区，以及雁北、察北的少部地区，一般着重翻地播种及消灭荒地白茬地。现大部地区已耕完，如房山一区共有地二万三千一百二十七亩，现已耕的一万六千八百零四亩，约占总地百分之七十三弱。南口分区共有荒地二十九万亩现已消灭十九万亩。由于领导上的注意和群众的创造，克服了天旱，畜少，荒地多的困难。如南口根据气候，很早就发动山地到平川，非灾区到灾区卖套。雁北组织人耕，平西房山新区，对黄土地曾采取了两轧一耕办法。平西水洼地早熟作物均已播种完毕，察南涿鹿春分前就已种春麦两万多亩。（二）在察北、察南、雁北、南口的北山地区，一般已完成了送粪，南口分区川地和南山一般都准备了足够的柴火，四海县大部村打下了全年的烧柴。植树一般均已超过原计划，但亦有一些偏向：如易县、涞源，领导上急于求成或强迫命令，结果植树活的很少。应县也有强调集体植的，没确定树权，因之有的群众说：是给公家植哩！特别是浑源五区，要求三天完成植树，结果徐沟村地冻未消，群众用火烧地挖坑。这些问题已检查解决，强调确定林权，保证植一棵活一棵，切实组织护林，并利用夏季雨季继续植树。
    近省委召开会议，强调必须把生产看成压倒一切的中心工作，树立领导生产的核心。目前生产重点，集中力量突击耕地，大量发展水利。近降雨地区，除抓紧时间突击早熟物外，开始大秋作物的播种。灾荒地方应注意节约救灾。
    察北、察南、雁北、和南口分区都下了一些雨，但深浅不一，灵邱等地雨量深约三寸，省委已急电各地突击播种。
