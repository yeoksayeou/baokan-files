　　[Chahar News] Significant achievements have been made in this year's water conservancy construction.
　　In terms of channel irrigation: Last year's floods severely damaged many beach channels in various places. However, with active repairs during last winter and this spring, all channels, large and small, were restored and released water around the Qingming Festival, ensuring spring sowing. Some larger water conservancy projects in the new district had once stalled in the early days of liberation. After discovery, the leadership promptly strengthened leadership, deeply publicized and explained policies, and correctly implemented the principle of keeping the original water conservancy organizations unchanged and gradually transforming them. Planned and focused efforts were made to repair and supplement projects, not only ensuring the original water conservancy, but also expanding the benefiting area of some channels. For example, the second channel of Wanquan added branch channels, expanding the irrigated area by more than 2,800 mu.
　　In terms of canal construction and beach repair: Incomplete statistics from 26 counties including Xuanhua, Wanquan, and Huailai show that 168 canals were opened and old canals were restored, irrigating 111,339 mu. Seven counties including Pingshan, Jianping, and Tangxian repaired 33 beaches, totaling more than 3,000 mu. In total, 114,757 mu were opened and repaired, exceeding the province's annual plan by 14 percent.
　　In terms of well digging and waterwheel installation: 2,084 wells were dug in 11 counties including Xushui and Mancheng (statistics only from Huolu County in the Jianping Special Zone), more than doubling the original plan. 344 old wells were repaired in six counties including Mancheng and Huolu. Incomplete statistics from 14 counties including Xushui and Huolu show that 1,329 new waterwheels were installed and 848 old waterwheels were repaired in nine counties including Xushui and Mancheng. The expansion of water conservancy through well digging and waterwheel repair is also more than 40,000 mu, basically reaching this year's planned requirements. The above three items total approximately 150,000 mu of increased paddy fields. In addition, the original plan for six large channels, including Jisanyi, Rongzhen, and Limin, was to expand irrigation by 45,000 mu. Rongzhen and Jisanyi channels are both irrigating, and efforts are being made to realize the expansion plan. The projects for Limin and other channels have also been largely repaired, awaiting flood siltation. Currently, water conservancy construction in various places is continuing to expand and develop. The province's plan to increase paddy fields by 200,000 mu is expected to be realized.
　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] In conjunction with production and disaster relief, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Administrative Office allocated more than 1.14 million catties of grain to repair the dikes of the Southern Grand Canal. The dikes have been in disrepair for many years, and many banks have been damaged. During last year's flood season, emergency repairs were carried out several times. Based on this, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Administrative Office's Water Conservancy Section and the Shandong Provincial People's Government jointly formed the Southern Grand Canal Management Committee to jointly measure and design and formulate a river management policy. In order not to delay the wheat harvest, construction has now begun. However, the spring famine in parts of Jining and Kunshan is severe. The Administrative Office has specially allocated more than 1.14 million catties of grain for river management in conjunction with production and disaster relief. In areas with heavier water disasters, each worker is given 4.5 catties of grain as a wage subsidy. In other areas, each worker is given 3.14 to 4 catties of grain. Additional rewards, materials, medicine, and other expenses are given for dangerous sections of the project. Based on the living standards in the disaster area, each worker's daily income can take care of the lives of one person at home in addition to themselves. The entire dike repair project is scheduled to be completed by the end of May. The people managing the river have now actively participated.

　　察省增水田十五万亩
  　冀鲁豫拨粮治南运河
    【察哈尔讯】今年水利建设，获得显著成绩。
    整渠灌溉方面：去年大水，各地不少滩渠遭受严重损害，然在去冬今春的积极整修下，各大小渠道，均于清明前后修复放水，保证了春播；新区一些较大水利，在解放初期曾一度呈现停顿状态，发现后，领导上及时加强领导，深入宣传解释政策，并正确的执行了对旧有水利组织不变，实行逐步改造的方针，有计划有重点的抢修整补工程，不但保证了原有水利，有些渠道更扩大了受益面积。如万全第二渠加开支渠，扩大水地二千八百余亩。
    开渠修滩方面：宣化、万全、怀来等二十六县不完全统计，开渠和恢复旧渠一六八道，浇地一一一三三九亩。平山、建屏、唐县等七县修滩三十三处，计三千余亩，合计开渠修滩一一四七五七亩，超过本省全年计划要求的百分之十四。
    凿井按修水车方面：徐水、满城等十一县，凿井二○八四眼（建屏专区仅获鹿一县数字）超过原计划一倍以上，满城获鹿等六县修复旧井三四四眼，徐水获鹿等十四县不完全统计：按新水车一三二九架，徐水、满城等九县修补旧水车八四八架，合计凿井按补水车扩大水利也在四万亩以上，基本上达到了今年计划要求。以上三项约计增水田十五万亩。此外计三、荣臻、利民等六个大渠，原计划扩大水利四万五千亩，荣臻、计三渠都在灌溉，正努力实现扩大计划，利民等渠工程亦均已大部整修，待洪水放淤。现各地水利建设，仍在继续扩大发展。全省增加二十万亩水田的计划，可望实现。
    【冀鲁豫电】结合生产救灾，冀鲁豫区行署拨粮一百一十四万余斤，进行修复南运河堤。该堤多年失修，堤岸破坏不少，去年泛期，曾经几度进行抢险，据此，冀鲁豫行署水利科，曾与山东省人民政府合组南运河管理委员会，共同测量设计，拟定治河方针。为不误麦收，现开始动工，惟目前济宁、昆山部分地区春荒严重，行署特拨发治河粮米一百一十四万余斤，结合生产救灾进行治河，水灾较重地区，每工发给工资补助米四斤半，其他地区每工发米三斤十四两至四斤，险工段并增发给奖励、工料、医药等费。就灾区生活水平，每工每日所得，除顾自己外，尚能照顾家中一人生活。全部修堤工程，预订五月底完成，治河人民，现已纷纷参加。
