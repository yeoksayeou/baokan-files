Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th -- The results of the second municipal and township elections since the war held in various parts of Italy on the 15th (the first was in 1946) show that the prestige of the People's Democratic Front, with the Communist Party and Socialist Party alliance as its backbone, is growing among the Italian people, and the votes obtained have increased significantly. Conversely, the government bloc composed of the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Social Unity Party (Saragat faction), the Royalist Party, and Fascist elements has been rejected by the people, and the votes have plummeted miserably. According to TASS reports: In Chiusi, Tuscany, the People's Democratic Front won 3,895 votes, while the government bloc won 738 votes. The Christian Democratic Party lost as many as 500 votes compared to the general election on April 18th last year. In Gravina, Rezzo Province, the government bloc could not even nominate candidates and had to mobilize voters not to vote. However, the People's Democratic Front won 6,939 votes, an increase of 3,000 votes compared to last year. In Manfredonia, Apulia Province, the Christian Democratic Party won 5,968 votes, a drop of 2,098 votes compared to last year; the People's Democratic Front won 5,674 votes, an increase of 1,001 votes compared to last year. In Molfetta, in the same province, the Christian Democratic Party won 8,557 votes, a drop of 5,296 votes compared to last year, and the People's Democratic Front won 7,676 votes, an increase of 2,713 votes compared to last year.
