Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 24th: Moscow dispatch: *Izvestia* Observer recently wrote an article commenting on the growth of the mass movement against the North Atlantic Treaty around the world, stating: Even before the signing of this aggressive pact, its organizers had already become isolated, and a powerful wave of protest against this pact, which prepares for a new war, is rising. The World Congress of Advocates of Peace reflected the scale of this struggle. After the Peace Congress, the mass movement continued to develop with new strength, disturbing all encouragers of new wars. While Churchill was applauding the Labor government for signing the North Atlantic Treaty, the British people were welcoming representatives of the Peace Congress at mass rallies and passing resolutions to fight for peace. Before the Senate approved the North Atlantic Treaty, the American ruling clique plotted to fabricate widespread mass support for the treaty. However, this adventure has embarrassed its authors. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard the opinions of dozens of political, social, trade union, and religious organization leaders, representing millions of members. They all condemned the North Atlantic Treaty as an aggressive military alliance threatening universal peace, and they demanded that the United States pursue a policy of peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union. The people of the world are strengthening their struggle for peace day by day, and the ranks of peace fighters are being tempered and strengthened in this struggle.

    侵略公约组织者陷孤立  和平战士队伍益加强大
    【新华社北平二十四日电】莫斯科讯：消息报观察家顷著文评论全世界反对北大西洋公约群众运动的增长称：这一侵略性公约的组织者甚至在公约签字以前，就已经陷于孤立了，抗议这一准备新战争的公约的强大浪潮正高涨中。世界拥护和平大会反映了这一斗争的规模。在和平大会以后，群众运动以新的力量继续发展，扰乱了一切新战争鼓励者。当邱吉尔正在为签订了北大西洋公约的工党政府喝采时，英国人民却在群众集会上欢迎和平大会的代表，并通过决议为和平而斗争。在参院批准北大西洋公约以前，美国统治集团策划捏造广大群众对这一公约之支持。但是，这一冒险已使其作者狼狈不堪。参院外委会听取了数十名政治、社会、工会和宗教组织领袖，代表数百万会员所发表的意见。他们全部谴责北大西洋公约是威胁普遍和平的侵略性军事联盟，他们要求美国奉行与苏联和平合作的政策。世界人民正在一天天地加强他们争取和平的斗争，和平战士的队伍正在这一斗争中受到锻炼和加强。
