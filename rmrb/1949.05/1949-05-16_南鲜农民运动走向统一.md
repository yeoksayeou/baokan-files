A line at the 38th parallel divides Korea into two worlds. North Korea, under the administration of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where the people have become the true masters of the country, is steadily moving towards construction, freedom, and happiness! South Korea, under the control of the American imperialists and their puppets, has become a living hell. Since the glorious uprising on Jeju Island in October last year, many areas in South Korea have seen the outbreak of farmers' movements resisting tyrannical rule. The foundations of the Syngman Rhee mini-dynasty are shaking and collapsing! Now, the South Korean Land Reform Drafting Committee of the Korean Republic has been formally established, and the draft will be submitted to the Supreme People's Assembly by the end of this month. This measure is being formulated in response to the urgent demands of South Korean farmers, who are under the brutal oppression of the American imperialists and Syngman Rhee. In the future, South Korean farmers will fight heroically to realize their program.

　　南鲜农民运动走向统一
    一条北纬三十八度的线，在朝鲜划开了两个世界。北朝鲜在朝鲜人民民主共和国政府管理之下，人民成了国家真正的主人，正迈着稳步走向建设、自由和幸福！而南朝鲜在美帝及其傀儡之下已成为人间地狱。自去年十月间济州岛光荣起义迄今，南鲜已有很多地区爆发了反抗暴虐统治的农民运动，李承晚小王朝的地基在震动、崩溃！现在朝鲜共和国的南部土地改革起草委员会正式成立，本月底即将以草案提交最高人民议会。这一措施是针对着在美帝及李承晚残酷压榨下的南鲜农民的迫切要求而拟订的。今后南鲜农民将为实现自己的纲领而英勇斗争。
