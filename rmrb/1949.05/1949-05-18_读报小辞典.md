　　Makarov—Stepan Osipovich Makarov, was a famous Russian naval commander, a naval officer who rose from the ranks of sailors. While serving in the Black Sea Fleet, he demonstrated rich experience in naval management and extremely progressive tactical thinking. He once strived to reform the corrupt and backward old Russian navy. He tried to build a new warship, the "Yermak," and wrote a special work on naval reform, but the corrupt Tsarist Russian naval authorities at the time not only did not accept his opinions, but also, out of jealousy of his talent, refused to give him a position of real power, and his works were even unable to be published or adopted. In 1904, when the Russian Pacific Fleet suffered severe losses in Port Arthur due to a surprise attack by the Japanese navy, Makarov was sent to serve as the commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet. After arriving in Port Arthur, he made every effort to strengthen the naval power, eliminate the opposition between the navy and the land forces, and began to correct the corrupt atmosphere of the navy, commanding more than 20 Russian warships and more than 100 Japanese warships in battle. In such a situation of disparity in strength, thanks to his wisdom and courage, he won many victories. Finally, because he did not receive the support of the St. Petersburg naval authorities, and the Port Arthur naval governor even constrained him, the Pacific Fleet finally suffered a complete defeat. Makarov also heroically died on March 31, 1904, when the "Petropavlovsk" warship was sunk.

    马卡罗夫——斯契泮·奥斯波维奇·马卡罗夫，是俄罗斯著名海军司令，一个由水兵中出身的海军将官。他在黑海舰队服务时就表现了治理海军的丰富经验，和极其进步的战术思想。他曾经努力地改造腐化落后的旧俄海军。他试造过一艘新的军舰“叶尔玛克号”，并写下了改造海军的专门著作，但是当时腐朽的帝俄海军当局，不仅不接受他的意见，而且因为嫉妒他的才干，而不肯给他有实权的职务，他的著作更得不到出版和被采用的机会。一九○四年，俄国太平洋舰队，在旅顺口受到日本海军的突然袭击而受到了严重的损失时，马卡罗夫方被派担任俄国太平洋舰队司令，他到达旅顺口后，竭力增强海军实力，排除海军与陆地部队的对立，并开始矫正海军的腐化风气，指挥着二十多艘俄国军舰和一百艘以上的日本军舰作战，在这样实力悬殊的情况下，由于他的英明和勇敢，曾经打过很多胜仗。最后，因为他得不到彼得堡海军当局的支持，旅顺口海军总督更给他制肘，太平洋舰队终于遭受到溃灭。马卡罗夫也就在一九○四年三月三十一日随着“彼得巴甫洛夫斯克号”军舰之被炸沉没而英勇殉职。
