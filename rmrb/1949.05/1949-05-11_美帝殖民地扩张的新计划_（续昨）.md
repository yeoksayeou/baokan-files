New US Imperialist Colonial Expansion Plans (Continued from yesterday)
Original by V. Lutsky, translated by Yang Fu

Since World War II, American capital has dominated the Belgian Congo, exporting all of its uranium ore and controlling the region's tin and copper mines.

The "Gulf" Oil Company recently obtained a concession in Portuguese East Africa.

Early last year, the United States acquired an air base in the former Italian colony of Libya. US Mediterranean Naval Commander Sherman negotiated with Franco to obtain bases in Spanish Morocco and the Canary Islands.

In British colonies, the United States is successfully competing with Britain for commercial superiority. In 1947, US exports to the British Empire (including the United Kingdom) totaled $3.9 billion, greatly exceeding Britain's $2.3 billion. American companies have bought parts of the copper mines in Northern Rhodesia and British Southwest Africa. The United States has acquired several chromium mines in the Union of South Africa. In British Arabian protectorates, and Kuwait, which holds 15 percent of the world's oil reserves, the United States owns half of the shares of the Kuwait Oil Company. The United States has already acquired a first-class military base in Cyprus. American companies are planning to organize a special company to develop the natural resources of African colonies.

American monopoly capital is striving to extend its expansion to Asian and African countries that are nominally independent, and to push Britain's dominant position out of these countries.

In Saudi Arabia, the SAS Oil Company and the California Mobil Oil Company had already obtained a monopoly in 1933. Even before World War II, the American Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate had obtained exclusive rights to gold and other minerals besides oil in that country. The United States is building airports, ports, highways, and railroads in Saudi Arabia. The American Independent Oil Company last year also obtained the right to exploit oil mines in the area between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Since the announcement of the "Truman Doctrine" in March 1947, Turkey has not only become an American strategic base, but also a scope for American economic expansion. The United States supplies the Turkish army with weapons and places it completely under its control. It sends many military missions to this country and occupies its military bases; at the same time, it creates favorable conditions for American economic penetration into Turkey. In May 1947, the Angolan government lifted all restrictions, allowing American capital and goods to flow into the country, and allowing American companies to export their profits without restrictions. American companies have gradually begun to exploit Turkey's natural resources such as oil, coal, iron, chromium, steel, lead, and sulfur. They are now also demanding privileges for oil mines everywhere. American banks have established many branches in Turkey. According to the "Truman Doctrine," Turkey has received a loan of $25 million from the US Export-Import Bank, and military equipment worth more than $10 million; and under the Marshall Plan, it will soon receive $10 million in assistance. The aid agreement of January 1947 and the "economic cooperation" agreement concluded by the United States in July 1948 facilitated the expansion of American capital and accelerated the complete collapse of the Turkish national economy.

Before the war, American oil companies had already obtained concessions in Iran. In 1946, two Rockefeller companies, New Jersey Mobil Oil Company and Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, concluded an agreement with the British-Iranian Oil Company. Under this agreement, the latter was forced to supply the American companies with 25 percent of its production. They are working to increase this number to 40 percent.

In 1932, an American oil company obtained a concession for the Bahrain Islands, formerly part of Iran and later a British protectorate. American diplomacy, in order to weaken British influence and strengthen American influence in Iran, skillfully incited the contradictions between Britain and Iran over the Bahrain Islands. American military and political advisers are all over Iran, and have established control over the Iranian army and constabulary, military industry, military bases, and fortress areas, constantly interfering in the country's internal affairs, and constantly helping the reactionary ruling groups to suppress the growing democratic forces. These military and political measures facilitate the expansion of the American economy. The so-called "Seven-Year Plan for the Revival of Iran" drafted and already being implemented by the United States is designed to adapt Iran's national economy to the interests of American monopoly capital.

In Afghanistan, the American Ganderson Company obtained concessions for the oil fields of Harat, the gold and silver mines of Gandahar, the chromium mines of Logar, and the construction of two airports. According to reports in the Iranian newspaper Keymi, the British government protested when negotiations began at the end of 1948.

In Egypt, American companies and British companies are jointly developing the rich oil deposits of the Sinai Peninsula. The United States is now negotiating to purchase shares in the Suez Canal from Vatican and French shareholders; their representative, former US Ambassador to Egypt Tuck, has become a director of the Suez Canal Company. In the autumn of 1947, the Egyptian government signed a contract for "technical assistance" with several American branches, according to which a series of American factories and American-Egyptian joint factories will soon be established in Egypt.

In Syria and Lebanon, American monopoly capital has concessions for the construction of oil pipelines, refineries, an automobile factory, and several other factories.

American investment in Palestine amounted to $150 million in 1945. The US Export-Import Bank is about to approve a $100 million loan to Israel.

American monopoly capital is striving to increase its shares in the Iraq Petroleum Company. American loans for large irrigation projects in Iraq and Transjordan have also been put forward for discussion. (To be continued)

    美帝殖民地扩张的新计划  （续昨）
    Ｖ·卢特斯基原作  杨甫译
    目第二次世界大战以来，美国资本就主宰着比属刚果，输出铀的矿苗之全部，和控制着那个地区的锡矿和铜矿。
    “海湾”煤油公司，最近在葡属东非获得一个特许权。
    去年初，美国在前意属利比亚殖民地获得一空军基地。地中海美海军司令谢尔曼，为了取得西属摩洛哥和加拿里岛的基地，而和佛朗哥谈判。
    在英国殖民地，美国是成功地和英国争夺着商业的优越权。一九四七年，美国对英帝国（包括联合王国全部在内）的输出，共达三十九亿美元，大大超过了英国的二十三亿美元。美国公司已收买了北罗德西亚及英属西南非的铜矿之部分。美国已在南非联邦获得几个铬矿。在英国的阿拉伯的保护地、和著名的占世界油藏的百分之十五的库怀特，美国拥有库怀特煤油公司股份之一半。美国在西普鲁斯已经取得一等的军事基地。美国公司正计划组织一特种公司，以便开发非洲殖民地的自然富源。
    美国垄断资本竭力把他们的扩张推进到亚洲和非洲只是名义上独立的国家，并将英国的主要地位，从这些国家中撵出去。
    在沙特阿拉伯萨斯煤矿公司和加里福尼亚美孚油公司，早在一九三三年时就取得了垄断权。甚至在第二次世界大战之前，美国的沙特阿拉伯矿业辛迪加，就在那个国家里获得了除了石油之外的金矿及其他矿产的特权。美国正在沙特阿拉伯建筑机场、港口、公路和铁道。美国独立煤油公司去年又在沙特阿拉伯和库怀特之间的地带，获得开采油矿的特权。
    自从一九四七年三月宣布“杜鲁门主义”以来，土耳其除了变为美国战略基地外，又变为美国经济扩张的范围。美国供给土耳其军队以武器，并把它完全置于它的控制之下。它派出许多军事使团到这个国家里来，和占有它的军事基地；同时为美国经济深入土耳其造成有利条件。一九四七年五月，安哥拉政府解除了一切限制，使美国资本和货物流入这个国家，并允许美国公司无限制地输出他们的利润。美国公司已经开始逐渐开采土耳其的天然富源如油、煤、铁、铬、钢、铅及硫磺等等。现在还正要求着各地油矿的特权。美国银行已在土耳其设立许多分行。依据“杜鲁门主义”，土其耳已从美国进出口银行，得到二千五百万美元的借款，和价值一万万美元以上的军备；又在马歇尔计划之下，即将得到一千万美元的援助。一九四七年一月的援助协定和一九四八年七月美士缔结的“经济合作”协定，便利了美国资本的扩张；而加速了土耳其国民经济之完全崩溃。
    在战前，美国煤油公司在伊朗早已获得特许权。一九四六年，两个洛克菲勒公司，新泽西美孚油公司及苏各尼——瓦坎煤油公司和英、伊煤油公司，缔结了一个协定。在这协定之下，后者被迫供给美国公司以出产的百分之二十五。他们正在努力增加至百分之四十的数字。
    一九三二年，美国煤油公司就获得前属伊朗，后变为英国保护地的巴哈林群岛的特许权。美国的外交，为了削弱英国的势力，而加强美国在伊朗的势力，便巧妙地煽动英、伊在巴哈林群岛的矛盾。美国的军事和政治的顾问充满了伊朗，并建立起对伊朗军队和宪兵、军需工业、军事基地及要塞地区的控制，现在不绝地干涉这个国家的内政，和不绝地帮助反动统治集团去镇压成长着的民主力量。这些军事的和政治的措施，便利于美国经济的扩张。美国已经起草而且已经开始实施的所谓“复兴伊朗的七年计划”，这个计划是把伊朗的国家经济，适合于美国垄断本资的利益的。
    在阿富汗，美国甘德逊公司获得哈拉特的油田，甘达哈尔的金矿和银矿，洛加尔的铬矿，以及建筑二个飞机场的特许权。根据伊朗基耶米报透露，一九四八年底谈判开始的时候，英国政府曾经提出抗议。
    在埃及，美国公司和英国公司联合开发西奈半岛的富饶的油藏。美国现正谈判购买苏彝士运河的梵蒂冈和法国股东的股票；他们的代表，前驻埃及的美国大使图克，已经当了苏彝士运河公司的董事。一九四七年秋，埃及政府和几个美国分公司签订了“技术援助”的合同，根据这个合同，一连串的美国工厂和美、埃联合工厂，即将在埃及建立。
    在叙利亚和黎巴嫩，美国垄断资本已有建设油管、炼油所，一个汽车工厂以及几个其他工厂的特许权。
    美国在巴勒斯坦的投资，一九四五年计达一亿五千万美元。美国进出口银行即将批准给以色列以一亿美元借款。
    美国垄断资本，正力求增加他们在伊拉克石油公司的股份。为着伊拉克和外约旦的大灌溉工程的美国借款，也已提出讨论。（未完）
