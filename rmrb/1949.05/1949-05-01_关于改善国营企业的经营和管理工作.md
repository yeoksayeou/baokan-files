(Editor's Note: The following passage is taken from Section 2, Chapter 3 of the "Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Workers' Movement" from the Sixth National Labor Congress of China in August 1948. Because its content is still fully applicable to the operation and management of today's state-owned enterprises, it is specially re-published here.)

State-owned and public enterprises must earnestly improve their operation and management in order to achieve the goals of sufficient raw materials, low costs, good quality, large quantities, and wide sales. The solution to this task lies primarily in implementing the principle of enterprise management and practicing democratic management. In order to implement the principle of enterprise management, it is necessary to formulate thorough production plans and implement an economic accounting system throughout the entire process from raw materials and production to sales; it is necessary to use operational ability, labor skills, and dedication to duty as standards for employment, promote a performance evaluation system, and ensure reasonable working conditions to achieve a rational organizational structure with efficient and capable staff, each performing their respective duties; it is necessary to implement a strict system of individual responsibility, labor discipline, and rewards and punishments, implement labor inspection and finished product inspection, so that everyone fulfills their responsibilities, merits and demerits are clearly distinguished, and rewards and punishments are appropriate. In order to implement democratic management, it is necessary to establish a unified leadership factory or enterprise management committee in each enterprise and factory, composed of the manager or factory director, engineers, and other responsible persons in production, as well as representatives elected by the workers' and staff congress (equivalent in number to the other committee members). The factory or enterprise management committee, under the leadership of the higher-level state enterprise organ, serves as the unified leadership organ in the factory or enterprise, discussing and deciding on various issues related to factory or enterprise management and production. Resolutions passed by a majority of the factory or enterprise management committee may be suspended by the manager or factory director if they believe that they conflict with the interests of the factory or enterprise or are inconsistent with the instructions of higher authorities; the manager or factory director shall then report to higher authorities for instructions. If a majority of the members of the factory management committee believe that the manager or factory director's measures are inappropriate or disagree with their report, they may also report their opinions to higher authorities at the same time, requesting instructions together; however, before receiving instructions from higher authorities, the manager or factory director's decision shall be implemented. If a minority of the members of the factory management committee have different opinions from the resolutions passed by the majority, they may also report their opinions to higher authorities. In urgent matters that cannot wait for a meeting of the management committee, the manager or factory director has the right to handle them, but must report the process to the management committee afterwards and request ratification. In addition, in large factories with more than 500 people, a factory representative conference composed of representatives of the staff (including apprentices) from various departments can be established to convey and discuss factory decisions, production plans, and summaries of experiences under the leadership of the factory management committee, in order to absorb more mass suggestions and criticisms. The production group meetings that are now commonly used in many factories should also play their due role. Only through these democratic forms and democratic methods under centralized leadership can workers' management ability be cultivated, criticism and self-criticism within the factory be promoted, bureaucratic work styles be overcome, workers' sense of responsibility, labor enthusiasm, and disciplinary consciousness be enhanced, and correct labor competitions and labor hero movements be developed.

    关于改善国营企业的经营和管理工作
    （编者按：下面这一段文字，采自一九四八年八月中国第六次全国劳动大会“关于中国职工运动当前任务的决议”第三章第四节第二项。因为它的内容对于今天的国营企业的经营和管理工作，仍然完全适用，故特重新发表于此。）  
    国营、公营企业必须切实改善经营和管理工作，才能达到原料足、成本低、质量好、数量多、销路广的目的。这个任务的解决，主要在于贯彻企业化原则，和实行管理民主化。为了贯彻企业化原则，就要制定周密的生产计划，实行从原料、生产到推销的全过程中的经济核算制度；就要以经营能力、劳动技术及尽忠职责为用人标准，推行考工制度，保证合理的劳动条件做到机构合理，职工精干，各称其职；就要实行严格的个人负责制度，劳动纪律与赏罚制度，实行劳动检查与成品检验，做到人尽其责，功过分明，赏罚适当。为了实行管理民主化，需要在各企业各工厂中建立统一领导的工厂或企业管理委员会，由经理或厂长、工程师及生产中其他负责人和工会在工人职员大会上所选出的代表（相当于其他委员的数量）组成之。工厂或企业管理委员会在上级国家企业机关领导之下为工厂或企业中的统一领导机关，由经理或厂长任主席，讨论并决定有关工厂或企业管理和生产中的各种问题。在工厂或企业管理委员会多数通过的决议，如经理或厂长认为与该厂或该企业利益抵触或与上级指示不合时，经理或厂长有停止执行之权，并报告上级，请求指示；如工厂管理委员会多数委员认为经理或厂长的这种措施不适合或对其报告有异议时，亦可将自己的意见同时报告上级，一并请求指示，但在未得上级指示前，应执行经理或厂长决定；如工厂管理委员会少数委员对多数通过的决议有不同意见时，亦可将自己的意见报告上级，在有紧急问题不及等待管理委员会开会时，经理或厂长有权处理之，但事后须将经过报告管理委员会，请求追认。此外在五百人以上的大工厂还可由各部门职工（包括学徒）代表组成工厂代表会议，在工厂管理委员会领导之下，传达和讨论工厂决定、生产计划与经验的总结，以便更多地吸收群众建议与批评。现在业已在许多工厂中通行的生产小组会议，亦应发挥其应有作用。只有经过这些集中领导下的民主形式和民主方法，才能培养职工管理能力，发扬厂内批评与自我批评，克服官僚主义作风，提高职工的责任感、劳动积极性与纪律自觉性，并发展正确的劳动竞赛和劳动英雄运动。
