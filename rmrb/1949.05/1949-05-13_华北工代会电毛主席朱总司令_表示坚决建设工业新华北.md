    North China Workers' Congress Sends Telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    Expressing Determination to Build a New Industrial North China
    [Our Newspaper] The First Congress of Workers in North China, held in Tianjin, sent a telegram the day before yesterday (the 11th) to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, fellow workers in newly liberated cities such as Taiyuan, and farmers in North China, expressing their regards. In the telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the workers resolutely expressed their response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive for the restoration and development of industrial production, to unite all the workers in North China, and to build a new industrial North China. The congress expressed immense joy that the fellow workers in Taiyuan, Datong, Anyang, and Xinxiang had been liberated, and hoped that the working brothers in Taiyuan and other places would, in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, "unite as one and work together to restore and develop industrial production in North China." In a letter of慰问 to the farmers of North China, the congress paid high tribute to the great contributions of the farmers of North China in the eight-year War of Resistance and the three-year People's Liberation War. The worker representatives hoped that the working brothers and farmers of North China would unite more closely in the future, step up production, and "ensure the supply of food and industrial products, closely link the cities and the countryside, industry and agriculture," and strive to develop industrial and agricultural production, gradually achieve agricultural mechanization, and build a new North China and a new China!
