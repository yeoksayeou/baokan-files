The core of the United Nations, the Security Council, which bears the actual responsibility for maintaining world peace and security, must obtain the unanimous agreement of the five permanent members of the Security Council—China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—and the agreement of two other members for any international issue it handles to be formally adopted. This embodies the principle of great power unanimity, ensuring mutual understanding, trust, and cooperation among the great powers in strengthening world peace and security, becoming the strong cornerstone of the United Nations. This principle of great power unanimity, which is the application of the "veto power," was originally based on the suggestion of the late American President Roosevelt, passed by the Yalta Conference, and formally incorporated into Article 27 of the United Nations Charter at the San Francisco Conference.

Among the five permanent members of the Security Council, there is the Soviet Union, a socialist country that adheres to lasting world peace, but at the same time, there is also the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, which pursues a policy of aggression and expansion. Therefore, since the day the United Nations was established, the Soviet Union has adhered to the principle of great power unanimity and has vetoed all proposals that violate lasting world peace and are of an aggressive nature from being passed in the Security Council. This has created a great political and moral victory for the world's democratic camp in the United Nations.

The imperialist bloc headed by the United States has been scheming since the establishment of the United Nations, attempting to undermine the principle of great power unanimity. In addition to constantly and openly clamoring for the "abolition," "restriction," or "revision" of the "veto power," it also proposed the establishment of a "Standing Committee" at the second United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 16, 1947. This "Standing Committee" is the so-called "Little General Assembly," or "Interim Committee."

According to the American proposal, and the later revised proposal, the task of this "Little General Assembly" is to be able to meet at any time during the adjournment of the United Nations General Assembly and decide on issues that the Security Council should handle. Obviously, the purpose of the United States in proposing the organization of the "Little General Assembly" is to transfer the powers of the Security Council, which are limited by the "veto power," to the "Little General Assembly," which has no "veto power" limitations and does not require great power unanimity. In this way, imperialist countries can do whatever they want, and the United Nations will become their docile tool. On November 13, 1947, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, disregarding the firm opposition of the world's democratic countries, led a group of lackeys to pass the resolution to establish the "Little General Assembly" with a so-called "majority" vote. The Soviet Union and other democratic countries have consistently adopted a firm opposition and do not participate in this organization. - Editor

    关于“否决权”与“小型联大”的问题
    简复本市读者徐琴
    联合国的核心部分、负有维持世界和平与安全实际责任的联合国安全理事会，在它处理一切国际问题时，必须获得安全理事会五个常任理事国——中、苏、美、英、法的一致同意和另外两个理事国的同意，才算正式通过。这样就体现了大国一致的原则，保证了大国互相谅解、信任与加强世界和平与安全的合作，成为联合国的坚强的基石。这一个大国一致的原则，也就是“否决权”的运用，原是依据美故总统罗斯福的建议，经雅尔塔会议通过，在旧金山会议上正式列入联合国宪章而成为宪章的第二十七条。
    在安全理事会五个常任理事国中，有着苏联这样一个坚持世界持久和平的社会主义国家，但同时又有着以美国为首的奉行侵略扩张政策的帝国主义集团，因此，自联合国成立的一天起，苏联就坚持着大国一致的原则，否决了一切违反世界持久和平、带有侵略性的议案之在安全理事会通过。这就造成了世界民主阵营在联合国中政治上与道义上的伟大胜利。
    以美国为首的帝国主义集团，从联合国成立之日起，就处心积虑，企图破坏大国一致的原则，除了不断的公开叫嚣“取消”“限制”或“修改”“否决权”以外，又在一九四七年九月十六日开幕的第二届联合国大会上提出了要成立一个“驻会委员会”的议案，这个“驻会委员会”，就是所谓“小型联大”，或叫“临时委员会”。
    按照美国的提案，以及后来修改的议案，这个“小型联大”的任务，是在联合国大会闭幕期间，随时可以开会，决定安全理事会所应该处理的问题，很显然，美国要提出组织“小型联大”的目的，就是要把有“否决权”限制的安全理事会的职权，移到没有“否决权”限制，无须大国一致的“小型联大”来，这样就可以让帝国主义国家为所欲为，让联合国成为他们的驯服的工具。一九四七年十一月十三日，美国为首的帝国主义集团，竟不顾世界民主国家的坚决反对，领导着一群喽罗以所谓“多数”的赞成票通过了成立“小型联大”的决议。苏联和其他民主国家就一直采取坚决的反对立场而不参加这一组织。  编者
