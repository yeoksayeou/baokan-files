　　Suggestion to Railway Bureau to Add Ticket Windows for Military Industry Personnel
　　We feel that all the new systems on the railway are very correct. However, there are still some shortcomings, which we put forward for the Railway Bureau's reference:
　　1. It is completely necessary for staff to pay for tickets when taking trains, under the circumstances of enterprise management of public undertakings. However, we believe it is inappropriate to have to queue with the masses when buying tickets. Because most staff and soldiers take trains for official business, they often miss the train after buying tickets due to the large number of people buying tickets, thus delaying time and work. Therefore, we suggest that in order to maintain order in the station, queuing to buy tickets is correct, but each station should set up ticket windows for military personnel and staff to facilitate work.
　　2. Among the retained old staff, many still have Kuomintang work styles, such as having a bad attitude towards passengers and granting private favors. Relevant leading authorities should pay attention to education and correction.

### 建议铁路局增设军工人员购票处

　　建议铁路局增设军工人员购票处
    目前铁路上一切新的制度，我们感到都是很对的。但其中还有一些缺点，提出来，供铁路局参考：
    一、工作人员乘车纳费，在公营事业企业化的情况下是完全必要的，但在买票时要和群众一起列队等候，我们认为不妥，因为一般工作人员、战士乘车，大部是为公事，常因买票人多，买过后车却开了，因而耽误时间、工作。所以我们建议：为了保持车站秩序，排队买票是对的，但各站应设军人和工作人员购票处，以便利工作。
    二、留用的旧职员中，不少人仍带有国民党作风，如对旅客态度不好，讲私人情面等，有关领导机关，应注意教育纠正。
