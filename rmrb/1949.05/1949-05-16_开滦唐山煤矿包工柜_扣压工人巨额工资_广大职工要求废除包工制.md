　　Tangshan Telegram: The Kailuan Tangshan Mine Workers' Preparatory Committee has repeatedly uncovered incidents of foreman "cabinets" deducting huge sums from workers' wages, sparking anger among the mine's workers. It is reported that Kailuan's five mines have over 47,000 workers, of whom 78% are employed by foreman "cabinets" composed of one or several individuals. These cabinets sell the workers' labor to the mine owners, extracting exorbitant profits through layers of exploitation. In the Tangshan Mine, out of 11,155 workers, 8,447 are controlled by ten major foreman "cabinets." This time, with the financial assistance of a loan from the North China People's Government, the Kailuan Coal Mine began clearing outstanding wage arrears to the workers. On May 4th, when the mine authorities handed over the remaining one-fifth of last December's wages and the outstanding wages for January, February, and March of this year to the foreman "cabinets" for distribution to the "outside" workers (workers hired by the foreman "cabinets" to dig coal, ventilate tunnels, and erect sheds underground), the eight foreman "cabinets" of the No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 underground teams, as well as those at the mine entrance, actually withheld the one-fifth of December's wages, totaling over 2.9 million RMB, from 5,000-6,000 "outside" workers (the amount withheld by the Da Dong, Liang Yi, and Shun Xing foreman "cabinets" has not yet been calculated). After the Workers' Preparatory Committee discovered this, it convened an emergency meeting of worker representatives and team leaders on the 7th to expose the issue and question the owners and managers of the foreman "cabinets." The meeting resolved to repay the withheld wages at the current market prices on the 8th. Following this incident, the Workers' Preparatory Committee uncovered another wage deduction incident on the 9th. It turned out that when the mine authorities disbursed the wages on the 4th, they had intended to deduct 2,800 RMB per worker from the wages to repay the loans taken out by the workers at the end of last year. However, after negotiations between the workers and the mine authorities, it was agreed to postpone the deduction. When the foreman "cabinets" distributed the wages to the "outside" workers, nine out of the ten foreman "cabinets," except for "Liang Yi," only distributed 70% of the total wages to the workers, privately withholding 30%. Each foreman "cabinet" distributed exactly 70%, no more, no less, indicating a pre-planned conspiracy. After the mine's Workers' Preparatory Committee discovered this, it immediately negotiated with the foreman "cabinets" on the evening of the 9th and decided to return the withheld wages to the workers at the current market prices on the 10th. The workers are extremely resentful of these illegal acts by the foreman "cabinets" and demand the abolition of this foreman system that exploits the workers.

　　开滦唐山煤矿包工柜
  　扣压工人巨额工资
    广大职工要求废除包工制
    【唐山电】开滦唐山矿职工筹委会连次查获包工大柜扣压工人巨额工资事件，引起该矿工人愤怒。按开滦五矿共有工人四万七千余人，其中百分之七十八是由一人或数人组成的包工大柜所雇用。他们把工人的劳动力出卖给矿方，从中进行层层剥削，以获巨利。唐山矿工人一万一千一百五十五人，就有八千四百四十七人为十个包工大柜所控制。此次开滦煤矿在华北人民政府贷款扶助下，开始清理职工工资旧欠。五月四日矿方把外工（为包工大柜所雇用的在井下刨煤、放风洞、搭棚子的工人）去年十二月份所余之五分之一的工资及今年一、二、三月份的工资旧欠交由包工大柜转发时，该矿井下第一、二、三、四、五、六、八组及井口的八个包工大柜，竟把五、六千外工十二月份五分之一约计人民币二百九十余万元的工资扣押未发（大东、两益、顺兴三个包工大柜的扣押数尚未计算在内）。经职工筹委会发觉后，七日召开职工代表、组长的紧急会议予以揭露，并向包工大柜的东家和经理提出质问。经会上决议，在八日将所扣的工资按当天的物价还清。继此事件之后，九日又经职工筹委会查出扣压工资事件。原来矿方在四日开支时，曾拟从工资中扣除去年年关职工每人所借支的二千八百元，经工人与矿方交涉已答允暂不扣除。而外工的工资经包工大柜转发时，十家包工大柜，除“两益”一家外，就有九家只发给工人总数的七成，私自扣押三成未发。各包工大柜都不多不少同样发了七成，显然是事先有计划的通同作弊。经该矿职工筹委会发觉后，立即在九日晚找包工大柜进行谈判，决定十日将扣下的工资根据当天物价发还给工人。工人们对包工大柜的这些不法行为异常愤恨，要求废除此种剥削工人的包工制。
