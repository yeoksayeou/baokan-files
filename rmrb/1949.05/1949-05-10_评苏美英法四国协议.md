    Commenting on the Four-Power Agreement of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France
    The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France issued a joint communiqué on May 4, announcing that their representatives had reached an agreement on canceling various reciprocal restrictions between Berlin and the eastern and western occupation zones of Germany, and on convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries to discuss the German question. Although the correct resolution of the German question still depends on the discussions at the foreign ministers' conference, if the governments of the three imperialist countries, the United States, Britain, and France, do not abandon their reactionary policies of splitting Germany and using West Germany for aggression, a resolution to the German question still cannot be reached. However, in any case, the possibility of such a resolution has now emerged.
    The Soviet government has consistently adhered to the decisions of the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences in resolving post-war issues. However, the imperialist bloc led by the United States is not like this. They have repeatedly delayed the work of convening a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the peace treaty with Germany, violating the agreements they themselves signed. The Potsdam Agreement required joint action by the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in resolving post-war issues, primarily the German question, but the United States, Britain, and France adopted a policy of unilateral action. The Potsdam Agreement called for a democratic peace, but they pursued a policy of imperialist expansion, attempting to dominate the world. The Potsdam Agreement called for the eradication of German militarism and the remnants of Nazism, but they are fostering it. Regarding the German monopoly organizations that once served as the economic pillar of Hitler, the United States and Britain announced "Law No. 56" on January 7, 1947, to preserve them. The Potsdam Agreement called for an independent Germany, but they have turned western Germany into a colony of Wall Street monopoly capital and a military base for opposing the Soviet Union and invading other European nations. The Potsdam Agreement called for a unified Germany, but they have continuously taken steps to split it: as early as December 2, 1946, the United States and Britain separately signed an agreement to merge the American and British occupation zones in Germany; on April 19 of the same year, the United States, Britain, and France, disregarding the interests of the people in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, concluded a decision on the export and distribution of Ruhr coal; in January 1948, the United States and Britain adopted a decision to reorganize the administrative organs of the American and British occupation zones of Germany, establish a supreme court for the American and British joint occupation zone, and establish a German state bank; from February to June of the same year, the United States, Britain, and France held two separate conferences in London on the German question, passing resolutions to completely dismember Germany; in June of the same year, the United States and Britain also implemented a separate "currency reform" in West Germany. Until recently, on April 8 of this year, the United States, Britain, and France also formulated "occupation regulations" for West Germany at the Washington conference, announcing "unilateral agreements on a series of issues related to Germany." The "Berlin problem," which has become the focus of the "Cold War" for the past year, was also created single-handedly by the United States. The United States, Britain, and France group attempted to artificially create a tense situation in Berlin as a pretext for them to dismember Germany, establish a network of military bases in western Germany, and prepare for war and aggression.
    The politically, economically, and militarily reactionary and divisive plans carried out by the imperialist bloc in Germany have been met with just counterattacks from the Soviet side. Certain restrictions on trade and transportation in the Berlin area, implemented to protect the interests of the people in the eastern occupation zone, prevented the Anglo-American aggressive conspiracies from succeeding. The provocative and criminal activities of the United States and Britain cannot shake the Soviet Union's unwavering stance on its peace policy, nor can they frighten the peace-loving people of the world. The surging worldwide movement in support of peace is a powerful response to the United States' policy of preparing for war. Faced with the incomparably strong socialist Soviet Union, the magnificent people's forces of the world, and their own difficulties and numerous contradictions, the imperialist bloc's conspiracy to provoke a new war has met with a shameful failure.
    The Soviet government has consistently advocated resolving all differences in post-war international relations through peaceful consultation. Based on this principle, it twice held negotiations with representatives of the United States, Britain, and France in Moscow and once in Berlin between July 31 and September 18, 1948, regarding the Berlin issue and the German issue. During the Moscow negotiations, the representatives of the four countries reached agreements on restrictions in the Berlin area and currency circulation, as well as on convening a four-power conference to discuss "unresolved issues related to Berlin and any other unresolved issues affecting the whole of Germany." However, the United States and British governments actually rejected their representatives in Moscow and declared the above agreements invalid. Regarding this issue, Stalin said in response to a reporter from Pravda on October 28 of last year: "Those in the United States and Britain who advocate a policy of aggression do not care about reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union and cooperating with the Soviet Union. What they want is not agreement and cooperation, but talking about agreement and cooperation, while obstructing agreement, thereby blaming the Soviet Union, and proving that cooperation with the Soviet Union is impossible. The war instigators who are trying to launch a new war are afraid above all of reaching an agreement and cooperation with the Soviet Union, because a policy of harmony and unity with the Soviet Union is detrimental to the position of the war instigators and deprives those gentlemen's aggressive policies of any purpose." In this way, the path to a reasonable solution to the Berlin issue and the German issue was once again obstructed by the United States, Britain, and France.
    However, the evolution of history is not proceeding according to the wishes of the imperialist bloc. The Soviet government has consistently adhered to a policy of peace. Stalin further and accurately explained this in his two replies to reporters from the American International News Service on January 27 and February 2 of this year. Stalin's peace policy has won the unanimous support of people from all walks of life in countries around the world. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's peace policy is precisely a manifestation of the Soviet Union's great strength and its infinite confidence in the power of progressive humanity. This power cannot be stopped by any warmongers or any atomic weapons. The four-power agreement on the Berlin issue gives people new hope for a correct resolution of the German issue. We believe that the four-power foreign ministers' conference must discuss a peace treaty with Germany based on the Potsdam decisions. Germany must become a peaceful and democratic Germany, and the forces of Nazi militarism must not be allowed to revive; Germany must become an independent and unified Germany, and must not be allowed to be split and dismembered, become a colony of Wall Street monopoly capital, or become an outpost for warmongers to provoke a new war. Only by moving in this direction can the four-power conference fulfill its mission of resolving the German issue and thereby guaranteeing peace in all of Europe.

### 评苏美英法四国协议

    评苏美英法四国协议
    苏美英法四国政府于五月四日发表联合公报，宣布四国代表关于取消柏林方面和德国东西占领区之间的各项交互限制及召开四国外长会议讨论德国问题一事，已经获致协议。虽然德国问题的正确解决，仍有待于四国外长会议的讨论，如果美英法三个帝国主义国家的政府仍不放弃它们的分裂德国、利用西德进行侵略的反动政策，则德国问题的解决仍不能获得协议；但是无论如何，这种解决的可能性现在已经出现了。
    对于解决战后问题，苏联政府始终恪守着德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦会议的决定。但是以美国为首的帝国主义集团确不是这样。它们对于召开外长会议讨论对德和约的工作一再怠工，违背自己在上面签了字的协定。波茨坦协定要求美英法苏在解决战后问题首先是德国问题上的共同行动，美英法却采取片面行动的政策。波茨坦协定要求一个民主的和平，它们却进行帝国主义的扩张政策，企图称霸世界。波茨坦协定要求铲除德国的军国主义和纳粹残余势力，它们却在扶植它。对于曾经充当希特勒经济支柱的德国独占组织，美英于一九四七年一月七日公布了“第五十六条法律”，加以保留。波茨坦协定要求一个独立的德国，它们却把德国西部变成华尔街独占资本的殖民地及反对苏联和侵略欧洲其他民族的军事基地。波茨坦协定要求一个统一的德国，它们却不断地进行分裂的步骤：早在一九四六年十二月二日，美英就单独签订了德境美英占领区合并的协定；同年四月十九日，美英法不顾德境苏占区人民的利益，缔结了关于鲁尔煤炭输出和分配的决定；一九四八年一月，美英采取了改组德国美英占领区行政机构、建立美英联占区最高法庭和成立德国州银行的决定，同年二月至六月，美英法在伦敦单独举行了两次有关德国问题的会议，通过了完全肢解德国的决议；同年六月，美英又在西德实行了单独的“货币改革”。直到最近，在今年四月八日，美英法三国还在华盛顿会议上，制订了西德“占领法规”，公布“在有关德国一系的问题上的片面协定。”一年来成为“冷战”的焦点的“柏林问题”，也正是美国所一手造成。美英法集团企图人为地造成柏林的紧张状态，作为它们肢解德国，在德国西部建立军事基地网，进行备战和侵略的借口。
    帝国主义集团在德国所进行的这些政治上，经济上、军事上反动的分裂的计划，受到了苏联方面的正义的反击。为了保卫东部占领区人民的利益所施行的柏林地区贸易和运输方面的某些限制，使英美侵略性阴谋不能得逞。美英的挑拨性罪恶活动，丝毫动摇不了苏联和平政策坚定不移的立场，吓不倒全世界爱好和平的人民。风起云涌的全世界拥护和平的运动，就是对美国备战政策的一个有力的回答。帝国主义集团在强大无比的社会主义苏联面前，在全世界雄伟的人民力量面前，加上他们本身的困难和重重的矛盾，它们挑拨新战争的阴谋计划遭到了可耻的失败。
    苏联政府一贯主张用和平协商的方法解决战后国际关系上的一切分歧问题。它曾经本着这一方针，于一九四八年七月三十一日至九月十八日之间与美英法代表两度在莫斯科、一度在柏林举行关于柏林问题和德国问题的谈判。在莫斯科谈判期间，四国代表曾分别就柏林方面的限制和货币流通问题以及召开四国会议讨论“有关柏林之未决问题和任何其他影响整个德国之未决问题”，获得协议。可是，美英政府，竟然批驳了他们在莫斯科的代表，并宣告上述协议无效。关于这个问题，斯大林于去年十月二十八日答复真理报记者时说：“美英两国那些鼓吹侵略政策的人们，并不关怀他们与苏联取得协议和与苏联合作。他们所要的不是协议与合作，而是谈论协议与合作，而又阻挠协议，借此责备苏联，从而证明与苏联合作是不可能的。正在力图发动一次新战争的战争鼓动者，他们所害怕的首先就是与苏联达成协议与合作，因为与苏联和谐一致的政策有损于战争鼓动者的地位，使那些绅士们的侵略政策丧失任何目的。”这样，柏林问题和德国问题合理解决的途径，又一次受到美英法方面的阻挠。
    但是，历史的演变不是按照帝国主义集团的愿望进行的。苏联政府贯彻始终地坚持和平政策。斯大林在今年一月二十七日和二月二日两次答复美国国际新闻社记者的谈话中，对此又进一步地作了确切的说明。斯大林和平政策赢得了全世界各国广泛阶层人民的一致拥护。大家都知道，苏联的和平政策正是苏联强大有力的表现，是他对于进步人类的力量有着无限信心的表现。这个力量决不是任何战争贩子或任何原子武器所能阻挡的。四国关于柏林问题的协议，给人们以正确解决德国问题的新希望。我们认为，四国外长会议必须根据波茨坦决定讨论对德和约。德国必须成为和平民主的德国，而不允许纳粹军国主义势力死灰复燃；德国必须成为独立统一的德国，而不允许分裂肢解，成为华尔街独占资本的殖民地，成为战争贩子挑拨新战争的前哨阵地。四国会议只有朝着这样的方向前进，才能完成它的解决德国问题并进而保障全欧洲和平的使命。
