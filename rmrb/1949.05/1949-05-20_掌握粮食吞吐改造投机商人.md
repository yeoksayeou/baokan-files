Mastering the flow of grain and transforming speculative merchants, in close coordination with the government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, is an effective way to stabilize prices. Before the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the North China Trading Company arranged for large-scale grain purchases in various places to supply the liberated Tianjin and Beijing. Some speculative merchants, hearing this news, rushed to buy grain, attempting to create market chaos and profit from it on the one hand, and preparing to transport it to Tianjin to speculate again while revolutionary order was not yet established on the other. Therefore, in the three days from December 30th to January 1st of last year, prices fluctuated sharply, with grain leading the way. After studying the specific situation, the main store, in coordination with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, restricted the activities of speculative merchants on the one hand, prohibiting them from illegally seeking profits by adulterating grain with chaff and using inaccurate measuring devices. On the other hand, it sold off large quantities of grain, even though the store had already accepted the task of purchasing it. As a result, prices stabilized by the 2nd, and fell on the 3rd. Consequently, the Party's policies were implemented, and the task of acquisition was achieved, while the speculative merchants and warehouses suffered losses.

Grain stores not only assisted the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in strengthening market management, but also assisted in educating and transforming speculative merchants. Whenever adulteration with chaff was discovered, the government would order them to admit their mistakes in the market, and prohibit them from selling, or order them to sell at prices that deducted the adulterated portion. For those engaged in speculation and profiteering, their activities were restricted on the one hand, and they were educated and helped to switch to legitimate business on the other. The grain store would provide them with millet at market prices, have it milled into rice, and then buy it back at market prices (they could also sell it themselves), with accounts settled clearly each time. In February, fifteen speculative merchants, including Yao Zhenshan, Liu Songnian, and Wang Zhongli, were transformed in this way. They milled 25,000 catties of millet. They all said, "This can also solve our livelihood problems, why must we engage in illegal activities?!" This has played a great role in stabilizing prices and managing the market.

　　掌握粮食吞吐改造投机商人
    与政府工商局密切配合，适当地掌握粮食的吞吐是稳定物价的有效办法。平津解放前，华北贸易总公司在各地布置大量收购粮食，以便供给解放后的平津。一些投机商人闻风纷纷抢购，企图一方面造成市场的混乱，从中牟利；另一方面预备运上天津，趁革命秩序未建立时，再投机一次。故在去年十二月三十日至今年一月一日的三天内，以粮食领头，物价波动很厉害。总店研究了具体的情况后，配合工商局，一边限制投机商人活动，禁止他们掺糠使水，大斗进小斗出的非法猎取利润。一边大量抛售粮食，虽然该店当时已接受了收购的任务。因此，到了二号，物价即呈稳定，三号就下泻。结果，既执行了党的政策，又达成了收购的任务；而投机商人、货栈都赔了本。
    粮栈不但协助工商局加强市场管理，并且还协助教育和改造投机商人。凡发现有掺糠使水的，政府就叫他在市上认错，并禁止他出卖，或叫他以刨去掺假部分的价格出卖。对投机倒把的，一面限制他们的活动，一面教育他们，帮助他们转做正当营业。粮栈把谷子按市价合给他们，碾成米后，再按市价收回（他们自己出售也可以），帐目一次一清。二月份，经这样改造的有姚振山、刘松年、王中立等十五个投机商人。碾了谷子二万五千斤。他们都说：“这样也能解决生活问题，何必非干违法的事呢！？”这对于稳定物价，管理市场都有很大作用。
