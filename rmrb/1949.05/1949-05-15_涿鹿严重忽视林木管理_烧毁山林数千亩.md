    Zhuolu Seriously Neglects Forest Management
    Burning Thousands of Mu of Mountain Forest
    [Chahar News] Recently, incidents of mountain fires and unauthorized tree felling have been continuously occurring in the Damao District, Shangtun District, and Taipingbao District of Zhuolu. In late February, Zhao Sheng, a landlord from Chijian Village in Shangtun District, and Zhao Wenzao, a wealthy peasant, along with two others, were punished for secretly cutting down 63 cypress trees and were ordered to replant 70 trees. On April 10th, Dong Ren from Nanyulin, Taipingbao District, started a fire to warm himself while collecting firewood in the Lizhanggou mountain area, burning a total of more than 2,700 mu of forest and grassland (including more than 100 mu of birch forest). After investigation by the district, Dong was sent to the county and sentenced to four months of imprisonment. Recently, such phenomena still occur in the Fen Shuiling and Tangjiachang areas of the district. In Damao District, Li Jun and Ding Wanlu from Dongan Village burned more than 4,000 mu of grassland in February. By early May, the district had burned a total area of approximately 40 li in circumference. The most serious incident was when Liu Dengdi, a veteran from Lijiapu Village, burned down the state-owned large forest south of Yangjiaping on April 13th. According to statistics from Zhuolu alone, an area of approximately 40 li in circumference was burned, killing more than 300 pine trees, and most of the miscellaneous forest was destroyed. In addition, an area of approximately 50 to 60 li in circumference was burned in Xiaolongmen, Weizigang, and Dagou areas of Wanping, leaving nothing but ashes. The firewood that the villagers there collected for the entire year was also completely burned. The government will punish them according to the law. On April 25th, Dong’an Temple in the district burned down a state-owned forest area of more than 10 li in length and width (40 to 50 li in circumference). The tree planting work done by individual districts and villages is also not good enough. In many villages in Shangtaifu District, the work is done perfunctorily to fulfill official duties. Saplings that are three or four feet tall are buried only three or four inches deep. Some do not dig pits but simply surround the trees with soil. Most do not follow the planting methods arranged by the county. The same situation exists in Dabao District. The masses generally do not realize the benefits of planting trees and are afraid that it will affect the land. The district leaders neither lead personally nor conduct in-depth inspections.
    Given this situation, the masses are not protecting the existing forests and are not actively planting trees, resulting in serious losses to afforestation and forest protection work. In addition to replanting the poorly planted trees, the county plans to widely publicize the benefits of afforestation and forest protection in the future. Leaders must overcome bureaucratic work styles and have arrangements and inspections for afforestation and forest protection work. Those who damage afforestation and forest protection should be severely punished, and models of afforestation and forest protection should be commended.

    涿鹿严重忽视林木管理
    烧毁山林数千亩
    【察哈尔讯】涿鹿大庙区上疃区太平堡区，近来不断发生烧山、偷伐树木事件。上疃区池涧村地主赵生、富农赵文藻等四人于二月底偷砍了柏树六十三棵曾予处罚，并令其栽活七十棵树。太平堡区南榆林董仁在四月十日到里丈沟山上打柴，为了看烘火烧掉了林子草坡共二千七百多亩（其中大桦林百余亩），经区查清后将董送县判徒刑四个月。近来该区分水岭、唐家厂一带仍有此种现象发生。大庙区东安村李俊、丁万禄二人在二月里烧掉了草坡四千多亩，到五月初该区先后共烧掉了方圆约四十里的面积。最严重的是李家堡村荣军刘登弟于四月十三日将杨家坪南的国有大山林子烧掉。只涿鹿地界的统计约有方圆四十里的面积，烧死松树三百多棵，其中杂木林大部毁灭；另外烧到宛平小龙门、苇子港、大沟一带约有方圆五六十里的面积，一烧净光，那里老乡们打的全年的烧柴，也全部烧光，政府将依法惩办。该区东安寺于四月二十五日又烧掉了国有林子纵横十余里的面积（方圆四五十里）。植树方面个别区村作的也不够好。上太府区很多村庄是支应公事，三四尺高的栽子只埋三几寸深，有的不挖坑只用土把树栽围住，多数没照着县里布置方法去植。大堡区也有此种情形。群众一般的都没认识到植树的好处。都怕吸地，区的领导则既不亲自领导，又不深入检查。
    根据这样情形，群众对旧有林子不加保护，又不积极植树，致使造林护林工作受到严重损失。县里检查除没种好的重栽外，计划今后要普遍宣传造林护林利益。领导上克服官僚主义作风，对造林护林工作要有布置有检查。对破坏造林护林的分子要严格处罚，对造林护林的模范应予以表扬。
