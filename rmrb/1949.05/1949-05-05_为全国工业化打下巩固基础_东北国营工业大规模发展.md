Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. Comprehensive report: Large-scale economic construction has begun in the entire Northeast region. State-owned industries, which play a pivotal role in this construction, are overcoming various difficulties and gradually recovering and rebuilding. After the liberation of the Shenyang area, the heavy industrial center of the country, the Northeast Administrative Committee, in order to strengthen the unified management of the entire state-owned industry, established nine bureaus under the Industrial Department according to the nature of each industry: Electricity, Coal Mining, Machinery, Non-Ferrous Metals, Gold Mining, Forestry, Textile, Chemical, and Enterprise, as well as Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Coal Mine companies (the above does not include railway, transportation, and military industry and military supplies), to engage in specialized operations.

Electricity, as one of the lifelines of industry, was divided into three power grids in South Manchuria, Central Manchuria, and East Manchuria during the puppet Manchukuo period. After August 15th, due to the serious destruction by the Kuomintang army, most of the equipment had to undergo extremely difficult recovery and reconstruction. Currently, all of the Northeast's more than 200,000 kilowatts of hydro and thermal power (excluding local electricity), under the direct jurisdiction of the Electricity Management General Bureau, has six management bureaus. Their current task is to cooperate with the entire industrial and mining construction, to plan and adjust power generation within Northeast China, and to continue the massive recovery project.

Coal mines, with a reserve of over 200 billion tons, are also one of the major heavy industries in Northeast China. After three years of arduous restoration, the mines in Northern Manchuria have now entered regular production. The mines in Southern Manchuria are still working hard to recover due to the heavy damage inflicted by the Kuomintang. Currently, the Coal Mining Management Bureau has nine mining bureaus under its jurisdiction, managing forty mines, and this year's production target is to mine ten million tons of coal.

The machinery industry originally had a weak foundation, and suffered severe damage after August 15th due to the destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army. Recently, after the establishment of the Northeast Machinery Management Bureau, it is systematically restoring existing machinery factories, increasing the number of lathes, and serving the construction of industry, mining, and transportation.

Non-ferrous metals are an emerging industry in Northeast China. The Japanese invaders only started operating after the Pacific War. At that time, they mainly mined copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, molybdenum, vanadium, and other minerals for smelting. After August 15th, most of these mines and smelters were destroyed, and some were still unfinished during the puppet Manchukuo period. The current Non-Ferrous Metals Management Bureau is systematically strengthening geological surveys and mining work, and restoring smelters to meet industrial needs.

Most of the placer gold in Northeast China is distributed in Northern Manchuria and Rehe. The operating results have been good in the past three years. The current Mining Management Bureau has a total of four provincial bureaus under its jurisdiction. Last year, the mines in Northern Manchuria produced tens of thousands of taels of gold. This year, they will continue to operate by collecting gold and strengthen exploration and mining to increase production.

Forests, ranking first in the country with a total storage volume of 35 trillion cubic meters, have achieved considerable results in the past two years under the management of the Northeast Forestry Management Bureau. The bureau currently has five provincial bureaus, managing twenty-eight forest areas and twenty-seven lumber mills. During last winter's operations, there were nearly 100,000 employees (some of whom were seasonal loggers). The planned logging task of four million cubic meters of timber this year has also been completed, and they are currently overcoming difficulties to carry out transportation with all their strength.

The textile industry, which occupies an important position in the construction of light industry in Northeast China, is also undergoing restoration under various difficult conditions. Currently, 120,000 spindles and 1,600 looms have begun production, and it is planned to restore another 110,000 spindles and 4,000 looms this year. The Oriental Textile Management Bureau mainly manages sixteen textile factories in Andong, Wafangdian, Liaoyang, Yingkou, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and other places, and is guaranteed to complete the production of more than 60,000 pieces of raw yarn and more than 1.4 million bolts of cloth this year.

The chemical industry is also gradually recovering under the leadership of the Chemical Management Bureau. It is currently working hard to restore industries such as salt electrolysis, acid production, and oil and fat production, and is preparing to restore the synthetic petroleum industry.

Industries such as cement, paper making, rubber, and ceramics are all under the jurisdiction of the New Enterprise Management Bureau, with a total of sixty factories. Among them, paper mills are expected to produce more than 18,000 tons of various types of paper.

In addition, the iron and steel industry, known as the backbone of all industries, is also being vigorously restored.

The above-mentioned industries are an important material foundation for economic construction in Northeast China. Although they are still in the initial stage of recovery, the entire Party and all employees in Northeast China have strong confidence in quickly restoring and rebuilding the industry in Northeast China and laying a solid foundation for the country's industrialization.

This task is extremely arduous because it requires a series of large-scale and complex restoration, transformation, and reconstruction work. Although Northeast China has extremely rich natural resources and a relatively modern industrial base, all of these foundations were operated by the Japanese invaders in the past. All organizational structures and most of the equipment are affiliated to the enterprise system of Japanese imperialism, which is a colonial type of industry. After August 15th, after three years of fierce warfare, especially the serious destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army, the original productivity of these industries was reduced by an average of 50% to 70%. Therefore, after the People's Government took over these industries, it was necessary to quickly restore production to support the national liberation war and appropriately supply the needs of the people. However, this restoration work is not simply restoring the original production level and scale, but must re-establish an independent and self-sufficient industrial economy and lay a solid foundation for the country's industrialization. The current first step is to carry out preliminary restoration and reconstruction work based on the existing subjective forces and material foundations, while starting to solve a series of interconnected problems, such as strengthening the planning and organization of construction to carry out meticulous planned production and scientific management; strengthening management work, rationally using existing equipment, raw materials, funds, and technical conditions; implementing a strict economic accounting system; implementing the democratization of factory management; and systematically training a large number of management cadres and technical personnel.

    为全国工业化打下巩固基础
    东北国营工业大规模发展
    【新华社沈阳二日电】综合报导：全东北大规模的经济建设已经开始，在建设中担负支柱作用的国营工业，正在排除种种困难，逐步恢复与重建中。全国重工业中心沈阳地区解放以后，东北行政委员会为了加强整个国营工业的统一管理，即在工业部之下，按各产业的性质分设电业、煤矿、机械、有色金属、金矿、林业、纺织、化学、企业九个管理局及鞍山钢铁、本溪煤矿两公司（上述不包括铁路、交通及军工、军需工业），以从事专业经营。
    作为工业命脉之一的电力，在伪满时分南满、中满、东满三个送电网。“八一五”后，因遭受国民党军队的严重破坏，致使大部设备均须经过极艰苦的恢复与重建。现全东北的二十余万基罗瓦特水火电力（不包括地方电业），在电业管理总局直辖下，设有六个管理局，其当前的任务正与整个工矿建设相配合，有计划地调整东北境内之发电，并继续进行浩大的恢复工程。
    拥有二百余亿吨埋藏量的煤矿，亦是东北的主要重工业之一，三年来北满各矿区经过艰巨的修复后，现已进入正规生产。南满各矿因受国民党惨重毁坏，仍在努力恢复中。现在煤矿管理局下，设有九个矿务局，分辖四十处矿山，今年的生产任务为采煤一千万吨。
    机械工业原来基础较弱，“八一五”后兼遭国民党匪军的破坏，损失甚重。最近东北机械管理局成立后，正有步骤地恢复现有机械工厂，增加车床数量，并为工矿、交通的建设服务。
    有色金属是东北的新兴工业，太平洋战争后，日寇才开始经营。当时主要开采铜、铅、锌、铝、钼、钒等矿，进行冶炼。“八一五”后，这些矿山和冶炼厂已大部被毁，有的还是在伪满时没有完工的。现有色金属管理局正在有计划地加强地质调查、采矿工作，并修复冶炼厂，以应工业之需。
    东北砂金大部分布在北满及热河两地，三年来经营成绩尚好。现该矿管理局共辖四个省局。去年北满各矿共产足金数万两，今年仍以收金方式经营，并加强探采矿工作，以提高产量。
    位居全国第一，总积蓄量达三十五万亿立方公尺的森林，于过去两年中，在东北林业管理局经营下，已获有不少成绩。该局现设五个省局，管辖二十八个林区及二十七处制材厂。去年冬季作业时有职工近十万人（其中一部为季节性的采伐工人），今年所预计的四百万立方公尺的林木采伐任务亦已完成，目前正以全力克服困难进行运输中。
    在东北轻工业建设上占重要地位的纺织工业，亦在种种困难条件下进行恢复，现已开始生产者有十二万个纺锭及一千六百台织布机，今年并拟再恢复十一万锭与四千台织布机。东方纺织管理局主要管理安东、瓦房店、辽阳、营口、牡丹江、佳木斯等地的十六个纺织工厂，今年保证完成生纱六万余件及织布一百四十余万匹。
    化学工业亦在化学管理局领导下逐步恢复，现正在全力恢复食盐电解、制酸、油脂等工业，并准备修复人造石油工业。
    水泥、造纸、橡胶、陶磁等工业，均属新企业管理局管辖，计有工厂六十个。其中造纸工厂预计可出各种纸张一万八千余吨。
    此外，称为一切工业的脊骨的钢铁工业，也正大力恢复中。
    以上这些工业是东北经济建设中的重要物质基础，目前虽然还都处在初步的恢复时期，但东北全党及全体职工都有坚强的信心，迅速恢复与重建东北的工业，并为全国打下工业化的巩固基础。
    这一任务积为艰巨，因为须要进行一系列规模巨大而复杂的恢复、改造以及重建的工作。东北虽然蕴藏极丰富的天然资源，且具有比较近代化的工业基础，但是由于这些基础均为过去日寇所经营，其一切组织结构上绝大部分设备，均附属于日本帝国主义的企业体系，是一种殖民地型的工业。“八一五”后，又经三年的激烈战争，特别是遭受国民党匪军的严重摧残破坏，这些工业的原有生产力，平均减低百分之五十至七十。因此，人民政府接收了这些工业之后，即需迅速恢复生产，以支援全国的解放战争，并适当地供应人民的需求，然而这种恢复工作却又不是简单恢复原来的生产水平和规模，而必需重新建立一个独立自给的工业经济，并为全国的工业化打下巩固的基础。目前的第一步工作则是根据现有的主观力量及物质基础进行初步恢复重建工作，同时着手解决一连串的互相关联的问题，诸如加强建设中的计划性与组织性，以进行缜密的计划生产和科学管理；加强经理工作，合理的使用现有器材、原料、资金以及技术条件；实行严格的经济核算制；贯彻工厂管理民主化；有计划地培养大批管理干部和技术人才。
