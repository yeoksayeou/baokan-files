  　South Korean People Expand Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th] TASS, Pyongyang, May 26th: The South Korean people are waging a struggle against the Syngman Rhee puppet government and for the withdrawal of American troops. According to the Korean Central News Agency: The people of Timaenke (transliteration) County, Jeolla Buk-do Province, southwestern Korea, after carrying out a resolute armed struggle, destroyed the police station and restored the People's Committees in three villages. These three villages are implementing land reform. The Syngman Rhee authorities continue to brutally persecute South Korean patriots and progressives, carrying out mass arrests and mass executions. On May 15, the Seoul police arrested forty teachers with progressive ideas. In another area, eight patriots who did not recognize the Syngman Rhee traitorous "government" were arrested, four of whom were executed without investigation, and the remaining two were sentenced to life imprisonment.
