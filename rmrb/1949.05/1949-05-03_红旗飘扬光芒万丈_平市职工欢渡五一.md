    Red Flags Flutter, Radiating Brilliance
    Workers in Beiping Joyfully Celebrate May Day
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The entire workforce and laboring people of Beiping City celebrated the first "May Day" after the liberation of Beiping with joyous revelry the day before yesterday (the 1st). In the early morning, hundreds of red flags fluttered atop factories and other tall buildings, shining with red light in the clear sky. Ten red flags fluttered in front of Tiananmen, and a huge portrait of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, meticulously crafted by the Academy of Arts and three zhang long, hung there, along with a red banner reading "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," further demonstrating the will and fighting goals of the working class.
    Around nine o'clock, celebrations were held in different districts by various public and private factories and enterprise organizations such as the Ministry of Railways and the Telecommunications Bureau. Mayor Ye Jianying, Minister of Railways of the Military Commission Teng Daiyuan, and Comrade Xiao Ming of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions went to various factories to participate in the celebrations. Workers in various public factories and enterprises launched production increase competitions to welcome May Day and achieved brilliant results. The entire workforce of the Jibei Electric Power Company completed their April competition ahead of schedule on April 26th. The workers of the Waterworks Company also repaired the Andingmen water plant ahead of schedule and started supplying water early from the 1st. The "May Day" labor locomotive of the Railway Bureau successfully passed its trial run the day before, ...
    At the joint memorial meeting of the Jibei Electric Power Company and the Waterworks Company, Mayor Ye Jianying asked the attending workers to: constantly put forward opinions on the construction of Beiping, assist the government in construction, organize to protect their factories, and seize the time to strengthen their studies. Minister Teng Daiyuan called out at the “May Day” memorial meeting of the Ministry of Railways: "Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, the railway will be built." The workers responded to these calls with warm applause.
    Workers in private factories also expressed their determination to "commemorate their liberation by increasing production." Yuan Lu, a worker at the Danhua Match Factory, said: "To commemorate 'May Day,' the working class must be more united, step up production, and support the front lines." At the memorial meeting, workers at the People's Paper Mill proposed a production competition to workers' brothers in other factories, guaranteeing to consolidate and improve the production achievements made to welcome "May Day." This was echoed by workers from other factories.
    After nine o'clock, propaganda trucks appeared on the streets. Qianmen, Xidan, Dongdan... at major intersections, crowds of people were everywhere. The workers' parade, led by red flags, passed through the crowds in large groups, with various forms of entertainment—yangko dances, waist drum dances, and land boats. Students and art troupes were also celebrating the workers' festival. The art troupe staged the "Red Flag Song," created by workers of the Daxing Cotton Mill in Shijiazhuang, and the North China People's Art Troupe performed a waist drum dance in disguise.
    At 5 p.m., representatives of public and private employees held a grand celebration at the National Grand Theater. Comrade Peng Zhen and Mayor Ye Jianying attended and provided guidance.

    平市职工欢渡五一
    【本报讯】北平市全体职工及劳动人民，于前日（一日）狂欢庆祝北平解放后的第一个“五一”节。清晨，在工厂及其他高大的建筑物顶上，飘扬起千百面红旗，在晴朗的天空中，闪耀着红色的光芒。天安门前飘荡着十面红旗，悬挂着艺专精心制作的三丈长的毛主席、朱总司令巨幅画像，一幅“将革命进行到底”的红字标语，更表现了工人阶级的意志与奋斗目标。
    九时左右，各公私营工厂及铁道部、电讯局等企业机关，分区举行庆祝会，叶剑英市长、军委会铁道部滕代远部长、市总工会萧明同志，分赴各个工厂参加庆祝。各公营工厂企业职工，为迎接五一，竞赛增产，获得辉煌成绩，冀北电力公司全体职工四月份展开的竞赛，提前在四月二十六日就完成了。自来水公司的职工也提前修复了安定门的水厂，从一日起提前送水。铁路局的“五一”劳动号机车已在前一天试车成功，………
