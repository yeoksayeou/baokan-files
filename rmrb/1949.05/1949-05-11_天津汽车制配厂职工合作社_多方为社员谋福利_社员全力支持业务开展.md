    Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing Plant Workers' Cooperative
    Working for the Welfare of Members in Many Ways
    Members Fully Support Business Development

    [Tianjin Telegram] The Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing Plant Workers' Consumer Cooperative considers the interests of its workers in every way, truly serving the workers, and has received enthusiastic support from the workers. When seven worker representatives from the plant, including Zhang Ruofei and Zhu Quanzu, were designated to handle this worker welfare undertaking, they decided to adopt the policy of making full use of their spare time, saving expenses, adopting mass opinions, and considering the interests of the masses in order to build the cooperative. When it was first established, it was named "Workers' Service Center". The factory lent 10,000 yuan as start-up funds, originally for purchasing desks, chairs, and furniture. However, the service center immediately contacted the Trade Takeover Office and bought 4,000 jin of salt for 9,200 yuan, which was distributed to workers at a lower price. The committee members of the service center brought their own pens and ink from home to work, and wrote on benches when there were no desks. They then distributed daily necessities such as millet, coal, and soy sauce. When distributing millet, in order to avoid wasting workers' time by weighing each portion individually, they spent two nights preparing, packing over 10,000 jin of millet into bags, each containing 20 jin, so that workers could take them as soon as they arrived. During periods of price fluctuations, they tried to minimize price adjustments. In particular, they always tried to keep the prices stable around payday. In addition, the service center also helped the worker representatives prepare for the lunch group, purchasing equipment for them, and lending them working capital. They also led the barbershop and organized workers to make collective single-layer clothing, saving 400 yuan per garment. Through these facts, the workers gradually realized that the service center belonged to them, and fully supported its development. Although the cooperative lacked capital, it gained the support of the masses and established credit externally, solving the funding difficulties. When distributing coal, everyone paid first and then the coal was distributed. Once, when distributing soy sauce, they purchased on credit first, sold the goods, and then paid. When the committee members of the cooperative were too busy, the workers came to help. To save expenses, the seven committee members tried to make full use of their spare time, warmly greeted those who came to buy goods, and often did the accounts until late at night. They often went to great lengths to buy cheap goods. The service center's high degree of enthusiasm in serving the masses left a deep impression on the masses and paved the way for the establishment of the cooperative. When the worker representatives of the factory cleaned up the old cooperative and returned its inventory and cash to the members, everyone said: "Let's re-subscribe!" Therefore, the service center convened a mass meeting to call for subscriptions and establish a workers' consumer cooperative. A total of 120,000 yuan was raised, with each share costing 50 yuan, and the largest subscription was 20 shares.

    天津汽车制配厂职工合作社
    多方为社员谋福利
    社员全力支持业务开展
    【天津电】天津汽车制配厂职工消费合作社，处处为职工利益打算，真正做到为职工服务，得到职工热烈拥护与支持。当该厂张若飞、朱权祖等七个职工代表被指定办理此项职工福利事业时，他们便决定以尽量利用工余时间，节省开支，采纳群众意见，为群众利益打算做为建社的方针。开始创办时，取名“职工服务社”，厂里借给一万元作为开办费，原是为了购置桌、椅、家具的。但服务社却立即与贸易接管处接洽，以九千二百元买了四千斤盐，用较低的价格配售给职工。服务社的委员们从自己家拿来笔墨办公，没有桌子就在板凳上写字。接着又配售了小米、煤、酱油等生活必需品。配售小米时，为了免去来一个秤一个，浪费职工时间，他们事前忙了两夜、把一万多斤小米分别装在口袋里，每份二十斤，随来随取。物价波动的时候，他们尽可能少调整价格。特别是发薪前后，总设法不使售价变动。除此之外，服务社还帮助职工代表筹办午餐膳团，替他们采购器材，借给周转金。另外还领导了理发室，组织职工集体作单衣，使每身节省了四百元。通过这些事实，职工群众已逐渐认识到服务社是他们自己的，并全力支持它的发展。社里虽然缺少本钱，但由于得到群众拥护，对外建立了信用解决了资金的困难。配售煤的时候，便是大家先交了款，后发的煤。有一次配售酱油，便是先赊下来，卖了货再交款。社里委员们忙不过来的时候，职工们就来帮忙。七个委员为了节省开支，尽量利用工余时间，对买货的人热情招待，结帐往往直到夜深。他们常常为了买便宜东西，不惜跑许多远路。服务社这种为群众服务的高度热情，在群众中留下深刻的印象，为合作社的建立铺平了道路。当该厂职工代表清理了旧合作社，将其存货现金发还社员时，大家都说：“咱们重新入股吧！”于是服务社召开群众大会号召入股，建立职工消费合作社。共收股金达十二万元，每股五十元，最多的入了二十股。
