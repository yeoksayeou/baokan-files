　　Yongqing, Ba County and other places find ways
  　Prevent and rescue cotton seedling blight
    [Our newspaper] News reported by reporter Zhao Gang: At this time of drought resistance and planting, how to protect seedlings and prevent cotton seedling blight is an important issue that must be taken seriously in various places. According to the recent understanding of the Pingnan Tenth District, cotton seedling blight has been found in some areas and villages in Yongqing, Ba County, Anci and other counties. In some villages in Yongqing, seedling blight has occurred in one-third of the cotton planting area, and in individual villages or households, seedling blight accounts for one-half, or even two-thirds. The village chief of Youyi Camp planted six mu of cotton, and four mu suffered from seedling blight. The current situation of cotton seedling blight: some seedlings wither before they emerge from the soil, and some wither after they emerge from the soil. The reasons for seedling blight: First, when planting began, many villages adopted the method of large-scale labor, rather than farmers freely and voluntarily forming groups to plant, so the work was not careful during planting, the pits were small and the watering was less, and the soil was not tightly sealed, resulting in death from drought. Some were black soil that had not been autumn-tilled, the pits were small and shallow, and there was little watering, resulting in seedling blight. Others were cotton seedlings that had just emerged from the soil and died from drought due to the dry land and lack of rain, coupled with wind and sand.
    After discovering this phenomenon, the prefectural committee has instructed all counties to seize the time to rescue and prevent it. For those that have suffered from seedling blight and are truly beyond rescue, farmers should be educated to quickly destroy them and replant them. For those that are not severely affected by seedling blight and can be rescued, farmers should be immediately mobilized to water them. According to experienced farmers, the method of "giving morphine injections" can be used for rescue and prevention, that is, on one side of the cotton seedlings, drill a four- or five-inch deep hole with a wooden stick, pour water into it, and then seal it with soil.

　　永清霸县等地想办法
  　防救棉花干芽
    【本报讯】记者赵刚报导：当此目前抗旱点种中，如何保苗和预防棉花芽干是各地必须重视的重要问题。据平南十分区最近的了解，永清、霸县、安次等数县，部分地区和村庄，均发现了棉花芽干的现象。永清部分村庄发生芽干的已占种棉地的三分之一，个别村或户发生芽干的占二分之一，甚而有的占三之二。右奕营村长种棉六亩，芽干的就有四亩。棉芽干的现状：有的是未出土就芽干了，有的是出土后芽干的。发生芽干的原因：一是刚开始点种时，不少村庄采用大拨工方式不是经过农民自由自愿结组点种，所以点种时做活不细，刨坑小点水少，加上封土不严，因而干死。有的是未经过秋耕的黑土地，坑刨的小又浅，点水少，而发生芽干。还有的是棉芽刚出土，因地干无雨，加上风吹沙打而干死。
    发现此种现象后，地委已指示各县抓紧抢救和预防。对已芽干而真正不能挽救者，应教育农民迅速毁去，重新点种。对芽干不甚严重而能挽救者，应立即动员农民点水抢救。抢救和预防的方法，经有经验的农民介绍，可用“打吗啡针”的办法，就是在棉苗一边，用一个木棍钻个四、五寸深的洞，将水灌入，然后封上土即可。
