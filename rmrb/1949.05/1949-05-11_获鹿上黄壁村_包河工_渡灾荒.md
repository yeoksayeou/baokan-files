    Huolu News:
    The masses of Shanghuangbi Village in the Fourth District are contracting river engineering projects to overcome the famine. The village has 153 households, and due to consecutive years of poor harvests, life is extremely difficult. Last winter, more than half of the households in the village had run out of food. Cui Shuande, the village branch secretary, tried every possible means to lead the masses to overcome the famine. Upon hearing about the contracting opportunities for the Shijiazhuang-Jinan Canal project, he immediately requested the district to introduce him to the canal engineering office. After returning, he called upon the masses, saying, "To overcome the famine, we must engage in production for self-salvation. Contracting the canal project is a good way. Whoever wants to participate should sign up voluntarily." The masses responded enthusiastically. He further stated that doing the work was good and would earn a lot of grain, so it was necessary to organize well, distribute wages according to labor, and share the profits and losses together. A total of 125 households, with 148 laborers, participated. They contracted 5,080 cubic meters of earthwork, at two catties of millet per cubic meter. On the first day, due to poor organization, each person averaged only three cubic meters of work. Shuande sought everyone's opinion and reorganized the team, combining strong laborers with strong laborers, and smaller laborers with smaller laborers, so that they would not rely on each other. Three days later, strong laborers were able to do seven cubic meters, and smaller laborers were able to do five and a half to six cubic meters. After completing the first phase of the project, they then contracted the old work of repairing the canal mouth. From last winter until now, 148 laborers have earned 20,600 catties of millet, solving the livelihood problems of 43 households in the village and paying off 8,000 catties of overdue public grain. Cui Shuntong worked for 40 days and earned a total of 280 catties of millet. In addition to helping his family of six solve their living problems, he also paid 120 catties of public grain.

    【获鹿讯】四区上黄壁群众，包运河工程渡过灾荒。该村共一百五十三户，因连年欠收，生活非常困难，去冬全村一半以上的户已没吃的，该村支书崔拴德同志想尽办法领导群众战胜灾荒。他听说石津运河出包工程，即马上到区要求介绍与运河工程处连系，回来号召群众说：“要想渡荒必需生产自救，我门包做运河工程是好办法，谁愿参加自动报名。”群众纷纷响应，他又说做工好，挣米多，必须很好组织起来，按劳力分工资，赔赚是大伙的。当时参加的共一百二十五户，一百四十八个劳动力。一共包了五千零八十米方土，每方二斤米。第一天没组织好，每人工作平均不过三方土，拴德征求大伙意见重新组织，劳力大和劳力大的结合，小的和小的结合，这样不互相依赖。三天后劳力大的能做七方，小的能做五方半到六方，完成第一段工程，接着又包上修运河口的旧工，自去冬到现在一百四十八个工，挣小米两万零六百斤。解决全村四十三户的生活问题，并交清尾欠公粮八千斤。崔顺同做工四十天，共挣小米二百八十斤，除帮助家里六口人解决生活外，还交公粮一百二十斤。
