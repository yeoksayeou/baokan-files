　　Taiyue Spring Planting
　　Completes Seventy Percent
　　[Taiyue Electric] Since last winter and this spring, the Taiyue area has had relatively abundant rainfall, thus ensuring timely sowing of most spring fields. Now the rainfall in the entire area is feeling deficient, especially in the first and second special districts. Seventy to eighty percent of the spring fields in the entire area have been sown, and twenty to thirty percent are being sown or have not yet been sown. It is estimated that 380,000 mu of spring fields in Jincheng and 90,000 mu in Meng County were completely planted before the 10th of this month. Yangcheng and Gaoping have also completed most of their planting. In Tunliu, Changzi, Qin County, and Qinyuan, millet has been mostly planted, but a small portion has not been planted due to lack of rain. Anze recently had a light rain of about one finger's depth, and is now seizing the opportunity to rush planting after the rain. Qingshui has planted 70 percent. Jicheng, Fushan, and Jiang County generally began planting cotton in early May, and are now nearing completion. However, due to lack of rain, most of the planting is "hope planting" (planting in dry soil hoping for rain), and a small part is spot planting. These three counties, plus Jiyuan, have planted 133,000 mu of cotton. This year, areas suitable for cotton planting generally planted more than last year, but due to the lack of rain and spring land, and insufficient publicity and leadership for cotton planting, it is still difficult to fully complete the original cotton planting plan, but the difference is not very large. For example, Jiyuan originally planned 45,000 mu, and actually planted 40,000 mu. For areas lacking rain and have not yet been planted, the masses are being mobilized to carry water for spot planting or "dry soil hope planting".

　　太岳春田播种
  　完成十分之七
    【太岳电】去冬今春以来，太岳区雨量较充足，因此保证了大部春田的及时下种。现在全区雨量已感缺乏，一、二专区尤甚。全区现已有百分之七十至八十的春田播种完毕，有百分之二十至三十的春田正行播种或尚未下种。计晋城三十八万亩，孟县九万亩春田，于本月十号前全部种完，阳城、高平亦绝大部分下种完毕，屯留、长子、沁县、沁源，谷已大部种完，小部因缺雨未种上，安泽最近几天内下小雨约一指，正抓紧雨后抢种，沁水已下种百分之七十。冀城、浮山、绛县于五月上旬普遍开始种棉，现已接近种完，唯因雨缺，大部是寄种，小部点种。此三县加上济源，已下种棉花十三万三千亩。今年适于植棉地区，一般的比去年种植为多，但因雨缺春地少，及对植棉宣传领导不够，全部完成原定植棉计划，尚有困难，但悬殊亦不甚大，如济源原定四万五千亩，实植四万亩。对缺雨尚未下种地方现正动员群众进行担水点种或干土寄种。
