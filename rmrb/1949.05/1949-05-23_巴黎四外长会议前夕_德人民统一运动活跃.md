On the Eve of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference

	German People's Unity Movement Active

The Paris conference of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, with the German question as the main topic, is about to be held. On the eve of the conference, the German people expressed their attitude towards solving the German question in the elections to the German People's Congress on the 15th and 16th. In the voting in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, 8 million people voted in favor of German unification, the conclusion of a just peace treaty, and the withdrawal of occupying forces. Prior to the vote, 500,000 working people in Berlin held a rally on the 12th, calling for the struggle for the unification of Germany and Berlin, for peace, and for the most rapid restoration of economic ties between East and West Germany. At the same time, the movement of the West German people demanding the convening of an all-German conference is also becoming increasingly active. However, the US, British, and French governments are continuing to promote activities to split Germany. In West Berlin, they promulgated the so-called "autonomy regulations," and Truman has appointed a "High Commissioner for Germany" to implement the "occupation regulations." This "autonomy regulation" is actually a disguised "occupation regulation." The West German people are placed under the enslavement of the three governors of the United States, Britain, and France, without any democratic rights. In addition, experts from the United States, Britain, and France have also held many separate meetings in Paris, and the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will also hold separate meetings. The purpose of these meetings is nothing more than an attempt to reconcile the contradictions between the three countries so as to deal with the Soviet Union and attack the German people at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　巴黎四外长会议前夕
  　德人民统一运动活跃
    以德国问题为主要议题的苏美英法外长巴黎会议行将举行。在会议前夕，德国人民在德国人民代表大会十五、十六两日的选举中表示了他们对于解决德国问题的态度。在德国苏占区和柏林苏占区投票中，有八百万人赞成德国的统一、缔结公正的和约与撤退占领军。在投票之前，柏林五十万劳动人民于十二日举行大会，号召为德国与柏林的统一，为和平，为最迅速地恢复东德与西德间的经济联系而斗争。同时，西德人民要求召开全德会议的运动亦日趋活跃。可是，美英法政府却在继续推行分裂德国的活动。在柏林西区，他们颁布了所谓“自治法规”，杜鲁门并已任命为实施“占领法规”而设置的“驻德高级专员”。这个“自治法规”实际上是变相的“占领法规”，西德人民被置于美英法三总督的奴役统治之下，毫无民主权利可言。此外，美英法专家还在巴黎单独地举行了许多次会议，美英法外长亦将举行单独的会议，这些会议的目的，无非是企图调和英美法三国间的矛盾，以便在巴黎外长会议上对付苏联，进攻德国人民。
