    (1) "Catch up with Da Kan!" (Exceeding the standard coal production quantity by the most is called Da Kan). This is the slogan proposed by the Mentougou miners themselves in the "May Day" Labor Day competition. In a short period of time, the miners have generally exceeded Da Kan.

    (2) The efficiency of machinists has also improved. Before liberation, a worker could only turn a dozen screws per shift, or six to eight can wheels; but now they are turning more than thirty screws, and twenty can wheels.

    (3) The workers on the spike drivers and drilling machines have doubled their production and surpassed it by scavenging scrap iron and broken copper. A drilling machine worker pointed to a broken iron handle and said, "Even this has to be flattened, we can't waste it."

    (4) The foundry has historically only opened the furnace three times every two months, casting two tons of iron each time; now it has increased to four times a month, casting three tons of iron each time. A fellow worker himself described the reason for the increased production: now that there is democracy, the workers can truly be "masters"!

    （一）“要撵上大坎！”（赶过煤的标准数量的多余生产最多的叫大坎）这是门头沟矿工在“五一”劳动节竞赛中，自己提出的口号。在短短的日子里。矿工们已普遍超过了大坎。
    （二）机工的效率也同样提高。解放前，镟螺丝一工只能镟十几个，镟罐轮一工镟六个至八个；可是现在镟螺丝已经到三十多个，罐轮镟到二十个。
    （三）打道钉和打眼机上的工人们，在废铁烂铜堆里，使生产和超过了一倍。打眼机工指着一个破铁＠柄说：“就是这里也得弄平了，不能浪费。”
    （四）翻砂、厂历来开炉都是两月不过三次，每次铸铁两吨；现在增加到一月四次，而每次铸三吨铁。一个工友自己叙说了增产的原因：现在民主，工人真能作“主”了。
