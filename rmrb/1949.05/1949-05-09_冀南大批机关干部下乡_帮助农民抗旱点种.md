Jinnan Telegram: Large numbers of cadres from Party, government, and military leadership organs at all levels in Jinnan have been dispatched to the countryside to help farmers fight the drought and plant seeds. Cadres and support staff from the District Party Committee, Administrative Office, Military Region, and other organs were dispatched together a few days ago to help farmers in the four gates of Wei County and more than ten surrounding villages plant cotton. At the mobilization meeting before going to the countryside, they proposed a competition to strive to be planting models, and stipulated disciplines such as not eating the food of the masses and not smoking the cigarettes of the masses, which raised morale greatly. The Administrative Office Secretariat held a mass meeting in Beiguan that evening, identified twelve households of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers as assistance targets, and dispatched twenty people with water carts to the fields at dawn the next day. The households being helped were touched by the enthusiastic help of the government comrades, and the elderly and weak also actively went to the fields. The masses in the whole gate actively soaked cotton seeds and looked for tools, saying in unison: "No matter how much effort it takes, we must complete the cotton planting plan." After the Administrative Office promotion team went to the countryside, they personally planted seeds as an example, and at the same time inspired the masses to recall the suffering of the famine in 1943, breaking the farmers' fear of effort and ideas of luck waiting for rain. Driven by them, Xitang Village in Wei County alone planted 120 mu in four days. The Third District Party Committee, at this critical juncture, instructed all counties under its jurisdiction to abandon all non-urgent tasks and dispatch 500 office cadres to the countryside to lead planting. Linzhang had four inches of rain at the end of last month, and the county Party and government leading organs immediately seized this favorable condition, dispatched 280 cadres, support staff, and elementary school students, and eleven livestock, to help the masses in the fourteen villages around the city plant seeds in turn. They also combined this with the propaganda of the liberation of Nanjing and other victories to inspire the farmers' enthusiasm for production. The various directly subordinate organs of the Handan Municipal Party Committee also dispatched 400 cadres and students to the countryside at the same time, learning and working at the same time. After six or seven days of assault, they planted 110 mu of cotton and sorghum, and also helped with miscellaneous tasks such as pounding manure, delivering manure, and harrowing the land. The Fourth District Party Committee also dispatched more than 30 cadres from the District Party Committee and Administrative Office organs to the countryside on May 4 to promote and help the masses fight the drought and plant seeds.
