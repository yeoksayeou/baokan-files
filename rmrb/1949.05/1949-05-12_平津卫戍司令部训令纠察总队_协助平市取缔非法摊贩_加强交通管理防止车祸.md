    Pingjin Garrison Command Instructs Military Police Corps to Assist Ping City in Banning Illegal Vendors, Strengthen Traffic Management, and Prevent Traffic Accidents
    [This newspaper's report] The Pingjin Garrison Command attaches great importance to the resolutions of the Beiping Municipal People's Government on rectifying the city appearance, banning illegal vendors, strengthening traffic management, and preventing traffic accidents. Because the abnormal development of vendors not only hinders traffic and disrupts the market, but also becomes a hiding place for bandits, secret agents and traitors, seriously affecting the establishment of revolutionary social order, and is already a matter of endangering public security. The Garrison Command has instructed the Military Police Corps to conscientiously cooperate with the Municipal Public Security Bureau in implementing the regulations of the Municipal Government. In order to prevent traffic accidents, in addition to instructing the military vehicle drivers to implement strict traffic rules and driving skills appraisal tests by the competent authorities, those who fail will be immediately suspended from their driving qualifications. Furthermore, political education will be strengthened to enhance the drivers' sense of responsibility. All military vehicles will undergo universal mechanical inspections, repairs, and adjustments of the brakes. At the same time, it is believed that the Public Security Bureau should promptly designate express lanes, slow lanes, pedestrian lanes, and uniformly regulate vehicle license plates. The undesirable phenomena of tricycle drivers disobeying traffic police commands, and traffic police being irresponsible and not conducting traffic direction in a loose and slack manner, should be strictly corrected.

    协助平市取缔非法摊贩
    加强交通管理防止车祸
    【本报讯】平津卫戍司令部对于北平市人民政府整顿市容，取缔非法摊贩和加强交通管理，防止车祸等决议，极为重视。因为摊贩畸形的发展，既妨害交通，扰乱市场，更成为匪特奸徒隐身之所，严重的影响着革命社会秩序的建立，已属妨害治安问题。卫戍司令部已训令纠察总队，切实协同市公安局按照市府的规定执行。为防止车祸，除对军用车司机即将责成专管机关实行严格的交通守则和驾驶技术的甄别考试，凡不合格的即行停止其驾驶资格外，并从政治上加强对司机责任心的教育。所有军用汽车普遍进行机件检查，修整停止闸。同时认为应从速由公安局划定交通的急行缓行人行路，和统一规定汽车牌照。对三轮车夫有不听交通警指挥者，及交通警不负责任，不进行指挥等散漫松懈的不良现象，应严格纠正。
