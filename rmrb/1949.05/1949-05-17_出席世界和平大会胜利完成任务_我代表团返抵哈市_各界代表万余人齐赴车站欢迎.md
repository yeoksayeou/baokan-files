Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th. The Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Defenders of Peace arrived in Harbin City on the morning of the 14th of this month. Over ten thousand representatives from various Harbin institutions and organizations gathered at the station to welcome them. As the train carrying the delegation pulled into the station, cheers erupted. After the head of the delegation, Guo Moruo, and others disembarked, they shook hands and exchanged joyful greetings with the welcoming representatives, creating an extremely enthusiastic atmosphere. The delegation first nominated the famous playwright Tian Han to speak at a temporary welcoming ceremony held in front of the station. He said, "On April 1st, when our delegation went abroad, Mayor Rao Bin, at the welcoming ceremony, represented the 800,000 people of Harbin in a speech, expressing the hope that we would return victorious after completing our mission. Mr. Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, hoped in his reply that by the time the delegation returned home, the flag of the people's victory would have been planted in Nanjing. Now, both hopes have been realized." He then reported on the World Peace Congress, pointing out that "The Chinese delegation has conveyed the will of the Chinese people to the whole world at the World Peace Congress, held simultaneously in Paris and Prague." Following him, youth representative Chen Jiakang reported on the warm welcome the delegation received from the people of various countries in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and said, "Representing the Chinese people, we rejected the unreasonable demands of the French government to limit the number of delegates and attended the Peace Congress in Prague. At the World Peace Congress, we not only expressed the will of the Chinese people, but also demonstrated the strength of the Chinese people." The delegation attended a reception banquet and a welcoming evening party that evening, and also attended a mass welcoming rally on the morning of the 15th.
