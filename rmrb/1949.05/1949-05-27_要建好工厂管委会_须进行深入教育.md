　　To Build Good Factory Management Committees
  　Thorough Education Must Be Conducted
    [This newspaper's dispatch] In order to more effectively carry out the publicity work of democratizing enterprise management, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of trade union workers from state-owned and publicly-owned factories in Beiping last night. More than one hundred cadres from sixteen units attended. The meeting corrected the extremely erroneous ideas of some trade union workers who did not want publicity work, believing that "workers cannot be educated." It demanded that in the work of establishing factory management committees, publicity, education, and deliberation must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and then a congress of workers' representatives should be established, and then a factory management committee should be established. The meeting also criticized the errors of certain factories in hastily and hurriedly establishing factory management committees, but the workers' awareness and understanding had not been further improved as a result.

　　要建好工厂管委会
  　须进行深入教育
    【本报讯】为更有效的进行企业管理民主化的宣传工作，市总工会筹委会特于昨晚召开北平市各国营、公营工厂工会工作者会议，到会十六个单位，一百余干部。会上纠正了某些工会工作者不要宣传工作，认为“工人教育不出来”等极端错误的思想，要求在成立工厂管理委员会的工作中，必须有计划有步骤的进行，宣传教育与酝酿，而后成立职工代表会，而后成立工厂管理委员会。会议并批判了某些工厂急燥的、匆忙的把工厂管理委员会建立起来了，但工人觉悟与认识并未因此进一步提高的错误。
