Ji'nan Baiyang Ancient Religion Counter-Revolutionary Riot Case:
    Seven Ring Leaders Sentenced to Death
    North China People's Government Approves Execution
    [Ji'nan News] Wei Guilin, Fan Qiming, Zhao Xiqi, Niu Gong, He Rui, Wang Tiande, and Li Shanglin, the principal members of the Baiyang Ancient Religion who organized a revolt in Guangping, Feixiang, Chengci, and other counties in the third district of Ji'nan last spring, have been sentenced to death by the Ji'nan People's Court. Wei Delin, an accomplice, was sentenced to ten years in prison. The North China People's Government has approved the execution according to the verdict. The Ji'nan Administrative Office has instructed the third district, as well as Guangping, Chengci, and Feixiang counties, to execute the judgment in accordance with the instructions of the North China People's Government. The original leader of the Baiyang Ancient Religion was Zheng Xishu, who was recruited by Kuomintang secret agents in 1944 to form the Ancient Religion Corps. Wei Guilin, Zhao Xiqi, Fan Qiming, Niu Gong, He Rui, and others participated. Later, they were defeated by our army, and Zheng Xishu was executed. Wei Guilin and others harbored a desire for revenge, secretly engaging in illegal activities and colluding with Hu Fengshan, an enemy agent in Anyang. Hu ordered them to gather men and weapons to plot a revolt and then defect to Anyang (which was then still in enemy hands). Wei Guilin and others then chanted incantations, spread superstitious rumors, and seduced the masses, uniting believers. On the seventh day, they organized a revolt, separately raiding the government, public security bureau, and Handan-Guang railway bureau in Guangping, Feixiang, Chengci, and other towns. They murdered, set fires, looted prisons, and plundered property, brutally killing many village-level cadres and civilians. Upon hearing the news, our local armed forces rose up in self-defense and defeated them, and the bandits were subsequently captured. After a year of interrogation, the case has now come to a conclusion. In the judgment, the Ji'nan People's Court explained in detail the criminal acts of the ringleaders sentenced to death, such as Wei Guilin, and the reasons for the judgment. Wei Guilin, Fan Qiming, Zhao Xiqi, and other principal members of the Baiyang Ancient Religion committed heinous crimes. The criminal acts of each defendant have been confessed and corroborated by each other and are consistent with the investigation materials. Based on the principle that the principal culprits must be severely punished, they are all sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life, in order to uphold the law. Wei Delin, an accomplice, followed Wei Guilin in killing village cadre Wei Yuxiu and burning down the militia team's house during the riot, but this was all out of personal revenge. He was originally a kind farmer who blindly participated in the counter-revolutionary organization. During the interrogation, he showed remorse. Based on the principle of treating cases separately, he was given leniency and a path to self-renewal, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.
    Editor's Note: Although the North China Liberated Area has now been completely liberated, the remaining enemy agents have not been completely eliminated. The masses are engaged in tense production, and a slight negligence in defense will give the enemy an opportunity to act, resulting in various losses. Although the Baiyang Ancient Religion riot occurred last year, it should still alert the leading organs in various regions to strengthen local security work, strictly prevent enemy sabotage, and protect the spring plowing of the masses. In handling the disturbances caused by secret societies, it is necessary to distinguish between the principal and subordinate members, and to differentiate between those who are resolutely counter-revolutionary political agents and those who have strayed into error due to economic reasons or temporary ignorance. The former should be resolutely suppressed, while the latter should be treated leniently and given a path to self-renewal based on the specific circumstances. The Ji'nan People's Court's separate treatment of the Baiyang Ancient Religion offenders is a good example. Only in this way can we guarantee revolutionary order and ensure the safety of the people.

　　冀南白阳古教反革命暴动案
    匪首七人判处死刑
  　华北人民政府已批准执行
    【冀南讯】去年春在冀南第三专区广平、肥乡、成磁等县组织会门暴动的白阳古教首要分子魏贵林、范其明、赵西岐、牛公、贺瑞、王天德、李尚林等七人，已由冀南人民法院判处死刑，从犯魏德林判处徒刑十年。华北人民政府已批准照判决执行。冀南行署已转令第三专区及广平成磁肥乡遵照华北人民政府指示，分别执行判决。白阳古教原教首为郑希书，民国三十三年即为国民党匪特收编为古教团，魏贵林、赵西岐、范其明、牛公、贺瑞等均参加。后被我军击溃，郑希书伏法。魏贵林等蓄意报复。秘密进行非法活动，与安阳敌特胡凤山勾结，胡令其集合人枪阴谋暴动然后投奔安阳（当时尚在敌手），魏贵林等便下神念咒，散布迷信谣言，诱惑群众，串连教徒，于七日组织暴动，分头窜扰广平、肥乡、成磁等城住地政府、公安局及邯馆铁路局等地。杀人放火，劫狱掠财，村级干部和群众被残杀多人，我地方武装闻讯起而自卫将其击溃，匪首先后落网。经一年之审讯，现已告一段落。冀南人民法院在判决书中对判处死刑之首犯魏贵林等之犯罪行为及判决理由一一说明。魏贵林、范其明、赵西岐等白阳古教的首要分子，罪恶滔天。各犯犯罪行为，均已自白互证，并与调查材料相符，根据首恶必办原则，均处死刑，褫夺公权终身，以彰法纪。从犯魏德林，在暴动中曾随同魏贵林杀死村干魏玉秀并烧毁民兵队房子，但皆为报私恨，本人素为善良农民，盲目参加反革命组织，审讯中尚知悔悟，根据分别对待原则决予从宽处刑，给予自新之路，判处有期徒刑十年。
    编者按：华北解放区今天虽已完全解放，但潜存的残余敌特仍未完全肃清，群众正紧张生产，稍一疏于防范，即会给敌人以活动机会，而招致种种损失，白阳古教的暴动案虽发生在去年，仍应引起各地领导机关警惕，加强地方治安工作，严防敌特破坏活动，保卫群众春耕。在处理会门的骚动时，必须分清主从，区别开那些是坚决反革命的政治特务，那些是因为经济的原因或一时无知而误入迷途的胁从分子，对前者，应坚决镇压，对后者则应根据具体情况，从宽处理给予自新之路，冀南人民法院对白阳古教各犯的分别处理办法，便是一个好的例子，只有如此，才能保障革命秩序，保证人民安全。
