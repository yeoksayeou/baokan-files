    Tuberculosis Treatment
    Question: I had a cough when I was two or three years old, and I coughed up blood when I was twelve or thirteen. It got better later, but it suddenly got worse last winter. If I'm exposed to wind or eat something salty, I cough so much that I can't breathe. According to the doctor, I have a weak lung and neurasthenia. Some also say it's bronchitis and lung disease. According to "Lung Disease Treatment," lung disease itself is not terrible, but what's scary is that it affects the heart's tuberculosis. Is there any place where surgery can be performed for lung disease, and what should I pay attention to in peacetime? What medicines should I take? Hoping for an answer.

    Answer: According to your description, it may be tuberculosis, but its infiltration period was when you were thirteen or fourteen years old, and now it has been more than ten years, and it has become an old lesion. Generally, old lesions are fine as long as you pay attention to rest.
    The treatment method for the disease is not difficult, but you must be patient and persevere. Do not interrupt it because of a moment of excitement or feeling that it is not effective. Now I list the rest method as follows:
    1. Avoid strenuous exercise. If you have a fever, you must rest in bed quietly.
    2. Pay attention to diet and eat more nutritious foods and change the types of food to stimulate appetite.
    3. Avoid all hobbies that are harmful to your body, such as tobacco and alcohol.
    4. Go to bed early, get up early, and develop regular living habits.
    5. The room should have sufficient light, and the doors and windows should be opened frequently to allow air to circulate.
    6. Avoid colds and all other diseases.
    7. Do not have mental burdens.
    Also, the sentence you asked about, "Lung disease itself is not terrible, but what is scary is that it affects the heart's tuberculosis," may not have been written that way in the original book; otherwise, it was written wrong. In addition to thoracoplasty and phrenic nerve avulsion, there is no suitable surgical treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. The former type of surgery does not remove the lesion, but is only an indirect treatment. As for lung surgery, it is generally not suitable for pulmonary tuberculosis.

    肺结核的疗法
    问：我在两三岁时便得了咳嗽病，到十二、三岁曾咳嗽的吐过血，后来轻了，但前年冬天忽转重，如遇风或吃较咸的东西，那就咳嗽的喘不过气来。据医生说，这是有点肺弱和神经衰弱。有的还说是气管炎，和肺病，据“肺病疗养法”上说，肺病本身并不可怕，怕的是影响心脏结核。现在对肺病有没有能实行手术的地方及在平时怎样注意？并应服些什么药品？望解答。

    答：据你谈可能是肺结核，但其浸润期是在你十三、四岁时候，现在已十余年了，已成为旧的病灶。一般旧病灶只要注意休养，那就没有什么关系。
    病的疗养法并不艰难，但须耐心坚持。不可因一时的兴奋或感不到效果而中断。今把休养法列举于下：
    １、避免过剧运动，如有热时则更须安静卧床。
    ２、注意饮食多食富于养料之食品及变换食品种类，以催起食欲。
    ３、避用一切有害于身体之嗜好品如烟酒等。
    ４、早眠、早起及养成规律之生活习惯。
    ５、居室内光线充足，常开门窗使空气流通。
    ６、避免感冒及一切其他疾病。
    ７、不要有精神上的负担。
    又所问的“肺病本身并不可怕，怕的是影响心脏结核”一句，可能原书上不是那样写的；否则，便是它写错了。肺结核的外科手术疗法，除胸廓成形术、横隔膜神经捻出术以外，现尚无适当的手术疗法。前种手术也不是切除病灶，仅为间接的疗法而已。至于肺手术一般不适用于肺结核上。
