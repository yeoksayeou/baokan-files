    "Red Flag Song" Director's Words
    Chen Huai'ai
    Since the focus of the revolution has shifted from the countryside to the city, relying on the working class, strengthening production, and striving to support the front lines, "transforming the consuming city into a producing city" is our primary task in building a new city. In order to respond to the Party's call and obey the political requirements, we have begun to attempt to rehearse the workers' drama "Red Flag Song," which is a very glorious and solemn task.
    Most of us—directors and actors—do not have enough experience or understanding of the workers' thoughts, emotions, lives, and production situations. We believe that in order to complete the performance of this play, we must go deep into the factories and learn from the worker comrades to solve many of the difficult problems in the play. Later, with the permission of the superior leadership, the entire troupe stayed at the Da Xing Yarn Factory in Zhengding, Shijiazhuang (the script is based on the Da Xing Yarn Factory) to rehearse this play.
    In the factory, in addition to making technical preparations, we devoted all our time to the working masses, collectively holding symposiums and get-togethers with them, listening to their reports; individually making friends, conducting interviews, exchanging opinions, and going to the workshops and workrooms to work and live with them to understand the general situation before formally starting rehearsals. When specific difficulties arose during rehearsals, or after completing a scene, we would ask many worker comrades to solve the difficulties and evaluate our work. Only through such repeated contact with worker comrades and administrative cadres could we complete the first performance in a short period of twenty days. We should especially emphasize that the fact that "Red Flag Song" can be brought to the stage twice is entirely due to the help of all the staff and workers of the Da Xing Yarn Factory. If the actors have achieved something today, it is the result of learning from them.
    "Red Flag Song" was performed more than a dozen times in Shijiazhuang and Zhengding for worker comrades, People's Liberation Army soldiers and cadres heading south, and cadres and students of our school. After the performance, we received many valuable criticisms and instructions from the superior leadership and decided to rewrite the script. In a short period, we wrote and rehearsed simultaneously. Neither the director nor the actors had a complete script. This is how the "Red Flag Song" that is being performed today was rushed out again.
    Because we are not capable enough, but we have to complete this task in a rush, we must rely more on the masses and give full play to the spirit of collective creation. Therefore, in the first rehearsal process, we pointed out that we should wholeheartedly learn from the worker comrades; in the second rehearsal, we redoubled our emphasis on the importance of collective strength, making full use of everyone's strength to make up for the shortcomings of the directing team, while strengthening the staffing and division of labor of the directing team to achieve the principle of division of labor and responsibility and centralized leadership. Therefore, we emphasize that the "Red Flag Song" performed today is entirely a collective creation of the audience and all the comrades of our troupe during the first performance, and the directing team is only the person in charge of execution.
    Most of the working comrades of our troupe were transferred from the first class of our school after graduation. They have little experience in acting and a short period of business study. Although they have adopted a "good at learning" attitude, humbly exploring, experiencing, and creating in the rehearsal process, compared with experienced predecessors, they are far behind, whether in acting skills or in the degree of adaptation to the stage. This responsibility should mostly be borne by the comrades of the directing team, because we do not have the ability to give the actors more help.
    In the process of writing, revising, and rehearsing the script, we and the playwright were almost indistinguishable and closely connected. The director's requirements were met in the script, and the playwright's hopes were also fully expressed by the director. Although there may be some discrepancies in the handling of themes and the depiction of characters, we subjectively believe that there is no significant distance between the script and the performance. The creation and performance of this play are basically unified. This is also a feature of our collective creation.
    Finally, I hope that all the audience, especially the worker comrades and前辈 of the drama industry, will give more opinions so that the performance of this play can be more substantial and richer, so that the audience can understand from the stage how the Party relies on the working class, leads the factory, actively produces, and how it encourages and helps the staff and worker comrades establish democratic management methods and new labor attitudes, and work together for the construction of a new democratic country!

    “红旗歌”导演的话
    陈怀皑
    革命的重心从乡村发展到城市以后，依靠工人阶级，加强生产，努力支前，“把消费的城市变成生产的城市”是我们目前建设新城市的主要任务。我们为了响应党的号召，服从政治的要求，开始作排练工人剧——“红旗歌”的尝试，这是十分光荣而庄严的任务。
    我们——导演与演员——大多数对于工人的思想、情感、生活与生产情况，体验不够认识不够，我们认为若要完成这个戏的演出，必须深入工厂，向工人同志学习，来解决剧中许多困难的问题。后来经上级领导的允许，全团同志自正定到石家庄大兴纱厂住下（剧本系取材于大兴纱厂）。进行这个戏的排演。
    在工厂中，我们除了作技术上的准备外，全部时间都投入工人群众中去，集体地跟他们开座谈会，同乐会，听他们作报告；个别地交朋友进行访问，交换意见，随时到车间和工房里跟他们在一道工作生活，了解了全般情况之后，才开始正式排演，等到排演发生具体困难，与排完一幕的时候，就请许多工人同志为我们解决困难并作鉴定。这样反复地接触工人同志和行政干部，才能在短短的二十天中，突击完成第一次的演出。我们应该特别强调地指出：“红旗歌”能够两度搬上舞台，完全应归功于大兴纱厂全体职工同志的帮助，如果演员们今天有些成就，那更是向他们学习的结果。
    “红旗歌”第一次在石家庄和正定两地，连续给工人同志、南下的人民解放军与干部、及本校干部、同学上演过十几场，演出后接受了许多宝贵的批评意见和上级领导的指示，决定把剧本重新写过，在短促的日期中，一边写一边排，导演同演员，谁也没有一份整剧本，就这样又重新赶排出来，这就是今天演出的“红旗歌”。
    由于我们能力不够，却要在突击中完成这个任务，更要依赖群众，发挥集体创作的精神，所以在第一度排演的过程中，指出要全心全意向工人同志学习；第二度就加倍强调集体力量的重要，充分利用大家的力量来弥补导演团的不足，同时加强导演团人员的配备与分工，做到分工负责和集中领导的原则，因此我们着重的指出，今天演出的“红旗歌”，完全是第一次演出时观众和本团全体同志集体的创作，导演团不过是执行的负责人而已。
    本团的工作同志，大半是从本校第一部毕业后调来的，演剧经验既不多，业务学习时间又很短，虽然在排演过程中，抱定“善于学习”的态度，虚心地摸索、体验、创造，但是，跟老练的先辈们比较，不管在演技上，或适应舞台的程度说，都差得很远，这个责任，大部分应该由导演团同志来负，因为我们没有能力给演员们更多的帮助。
    在剧本写作、修改与排演过程中，我们和剧作者，几乎不分彼此，紧密联系，导演的要求在剧本中具备了，剧作者的希望导演也都尽力表现出来，虽然在主题处理、人物刻划等方面，容或为一些出入，但我们主观上认为剧本与演出之间，没有很大的距离。本剧的创作与演出，基本上是统一的。这也就是我们发挥集体创作的一个特点。
    最后，希望所有的观众们，特别是工人同志和戏剧界先辈们，多多提出意见，使本剧的演出更加充实丰富起来，让观众从舞台上了解党怎样地依靠工人阶级，领导工厂，积极生产，以及怎样鼓励和帮助职工同志建立民主管理方法与新的劳动态度，共同为新民主主义国家建设而努力！
