　　Zhangyuan Gold and Silver Businesses Also Apply for Transition
　　[Zhangyuan News] Since liberation, cases of illegal buying and selling of gold and silver dollars have continued to occur in Zhang City's gold and silver industry, and several businesses have been punished. The government is paying close attention to this.
　　After the North China People's Government announced the "Gold and Silver Management Measures" on April 27th, the city convened a meeting of managers from twelve gold shops on May 5th. Manager Zhao of the bank's business office explained the government's gold and silver management measures article by article, emphasizing that the government's measures were to stabilize finance and safeguard the interests of the people. He also pointed out that under the New Democratic economic policy, industries that are not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and are not needed by the masses have no prospects for development. He advised them to transition as soon as possible to avoid selling out everything and quickly deciding to shift to avenues needed by society.
　　The feedback after the meeting largely indicated that the industry had no future, and the decision was made to find ways to change careers as soon as possible. Six businesses have already requested applications for closure from the government, requesting to cease operations and prepare to transition to rice and flour shops, cloth shops, cigarette businesses, soap making, and other industries.

　　张垣金银业亦相继申请转业
    【张垣讯】解放后张市金银业仍不断发生倒卖黄金银元事件，有数家曾受到处罚，政府对此极为注视。
    华北人民政府四月二十七日公布金银管理办法后，该市在五月五日召开全市十二家金店业经理会议，由银行营业处赵经理把政府对金银业管理办法逐条详加解释，说明政府此项措施是为了稳定金融，维护人民利益，并说明在新民主主义经济方针下对国计民生无利，群众所不需要的行业，是丝毫没有发展前途的。劝其从速转业，以免卖净吃光，早下决心转向社会所需要的途径上去。
    会后反映大都认为这行业实在没前途，决定赶紧想办法改行，现已有六家向政府索取歇业申请书，呈请歇业，准备转向米面店、布店、纸烟、造胰等业。
