    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Tokyo dispatch: Following the breakdown of negotiations between the Japan National Miners' Union Federation and mine owners regarding wage increases, 450,000 miners have begun a series of rolling strikes. 100,400 miners in Hokkaido initiated a 24-hour strike on the morning of the 3rd. According to union sources, 24-hour miners' strikes are scheduled for the 3rd and 7th in Hokkaido, the 4th and 9th in Kyushu and Shikoku, where the largest number of miners are located, and the 5th and 10th in Honshu. The strikes will severely affect Japan's coal production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: Rome dispatch: 300,000 chemical workers across Italy began a general strike on the 3rd. The workers are demanding revisions to collective contracts, higher wages, guarantees of workers' rights, and that employers not be allowed to close factories or lay off workers en masse. However, during negotiations, the factory owners, relying on government support, adamantly refused, and the chemical workers decided to respond with a strike. The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labour has called on workers throughout Italy to support the chemical workers' strike, pointing out that this is an attack by factory owners to weaken and divide the labor movement.

    日本四十五万矿工分批罢工要求增资
    意三十万化学工人总罢工
    【新华社北平四日电】东京消息：日本全国矿工组合联合会领导下的四十五万矿工，在与矿主关于增加工资的谈判破裂后，已开始其一系列的分批罢工。北海道十万零四千名矿工，已于三日晨首先举行二十四小时罢工。据工会方面宣称：二十四小时的矿工罢工运动预定于三日及七日在北海道举行，四日及九日在矿工最多的九州与四国举行，五日及十日在本州举行。罢工将严重地影响日本的煤产量。
    【新华社北平四日电】罗马讯：全意大利三十万化学工人自三日起开始总罢工。工人要求修改集体合同，提高工资，保证工人权利，厂主不能关厂及大批解雇工人等。但在谈判过程中，厂主恃有政府撑腰，悍然加以拒绝，化学工人乃决定以罢工来答复。意大利总工会执委会已号召全意工人支持化学工人的罢工，指出这是对工厂主削弱与分裂工会运动的进攻。
