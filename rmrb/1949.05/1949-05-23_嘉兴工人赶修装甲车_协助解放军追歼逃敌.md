Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: Jiaxing railway workers bravely protected locomotives and assisted the People's Liberation Army in pursuing and annihilating fleeing enemies. On the evening of the 6th, when the PLA advanced to the outskirts of Jiaxing, railway workers at Jiaxing Station turned off the lights in the engine room to prevent sabotage by Kuomintang bandit troops. Driver Chen Daxing quickly extinguished the fire in locomotive No. 127. Veteran worker Wu Axing held up a lantern while engine worker Hong Desheng disassembled the locomotive parts. Ke Mu, the driver of armored vehicle No. 6009, removed the motor and generator parts of the armored vehicle. Railway workers such as Zhang Xianlun and Sun Changsheng hid the removed parts. Around 4:00 AM on the 7th, the PLA's advance troops arrived at the station in hot pursuit of the defeated enemy. The workers happily ran back from the surrounding fields and told the PLA, "The bandit troops have fled east not far away. Let us drive the vehicles and send you to pursue them!" With that, they quickly found the locomotive parts and, after a short period of intensive repair, the locomotives and armored vehicles were running again. The PLA jumped into the armored vehicles, and drivers Ke Mu and Lu Dasheng drove at full speed, carrying the PLA in a fierce pursuit eastward. They chased for thirty *li* in one go, finally catching up with the enemy, killing and wounding more than 30 enemy soldiers, and capturing a rear guard platoon alive.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 22nd: Employees of the Kunshan Electric Company and Telecommunications Bureau actively protected factory machinery before liberation. On April 27, when the pseudo-Kunshan County government fled to Shanghai, workers and technicians of the Kunshan Ultra-Shortwave Radio Machine Section of the former Kuomintang Ministry of Transportation's Second Telecommunications Administration Bureau disassembled and hid three receivers, two transmitters, one converter, and other valuable equipment, which were later handed over to the People's Liberation Army. Before the liberation of Kunshan, workers at the Kunshan Electric Company closed the factory gates every day before dark to prevent sabotage by bandit troops, ensuring that the factory remained intact. After liberation, electricity was restored as usual that night. In addition, seventeen workers of the Kunshan Station Engineering Section voluntarily rushed to repair an important bridge south of the city that had been damaged by fleeing bandit troops, allowing the PLA to pass smoothly and pursue the fleeing enemy towards Shanghai.
