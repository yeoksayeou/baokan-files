    Tianjin Begins Making Its Own Water Meters
    Imitation Worker Wang Liankai Selected as First-Class Model
    [Tianjin Electric] Tianjin Waterworks worker Wang Liankai, who successfully imitated and produced water meters, has completed the establishment of the meter-making workshop according to plan after more than two months of effort, and has officially started producing water meters. He and all the workers in the meter-making workshop he founded were rated as the factory's first-class individual model and first-class collective model in the factory's April production commendation and reward model because of their remarkable achievements. Wang Liankai learned a craft in a machine factory in his childhood and has always been a technician. After the Japanese surrender, the factory where he worked was taken over by the Kuomintang reactionary government, and he lost his job. Later, he worked as a handyman in the waterworks. At that time, he often saw the factory buying water meters from foreign merchants, which were very expensive, but the structure was not complicated. He wanted to imitate them himself, but he had no money or status, so he had to bury this idea deep in his heart. After the liberation of Tianjin, the People's Government called on workers to contribute their technology, and he dared to express his wish. The military representative of the factory not only encouraged him, but also allocated a sum of money for him to purchase materials for trial production. After a full eight days of experimentation and three setbacks, the trial production was finally successful. This creation can save the factory half of the cost of purchasing foreign goods when replacing most of the dilapidated water meters among the thousands of users in the factory. Therefore, the factory decided to establish a meter-making workshop for mass production. Wang Liankai and three unskilled partners overcame many difficulties in establishing the meter-making workshop. They bought several machines on the market at a very low price and installed them themselves. Even many meter-making tools were made by themselves.

    津开始自制水表
    仿制工人王连凯选为一等模范
    【天津电】天津市自来水厂仿制水表成功的工人王连凯经过两月多的努力，已按计划完成了制表房的建立工作，并已正式出产水表。他和他一手创办的制表房全体工友，在该厂四月份出产评功奖模中，因成绩显著，被评为全厂一等个人模范和一等集体模范。王连凯幼年曾在机器工厂学过手艺，且一直当着技工，日本投降后，他做工的工厂被国民党反动政府劫收，他失了业。后到自来水厂当杂役。那时他常见厂方向外商购买水表，很贵，构造却并不复杂，他便想自己仿造，但他既没钱，又没地位，只好将此念头深埋心里。津市解放后，人民政府号召工友贡献技术他才大胆说出自己的心愿。该厂的军事代表不但鼓励他，而且拨出一笔钱，供他购买材料进行试制。经过整整八天的实验，遭遇三次挫折，终于试制成功。这一创造可使该厂数千用户中大部破旧的水表更换时，比购买外货节省一半用费。因此该厂决定建立制表房大量制造。王连凯和三个技术不熟练的伙伴，在建立制表房时曾克服了许多困难。他们用极低的代价在市上购得了几架机器，自己按装，甚至许多制表工具也是他们自己动手做的。
