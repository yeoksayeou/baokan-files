    New University Affairs Committees Established at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Peking Normal University; Administrative Heads of Each University Also Announced
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the liberation of Beiping, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beiping Normal University have been under the administration of the Military Control Commission's Cultural Takeover Committee for several months. The takeover work at each university has long been completed, and management and reform are being carried out gradually. The Student Affairs Departments have been abolished across the board, and the staff have been reassigned or otherwise dealt with. To meet new needs, each university's curriculum has begun to undergo some reforms. For example, the Peking University Law Department has eliminated thirteen old law courses and added five new ones; Tsinghua's social survey course is using new methods to conduct rural surveys in Haidian. Departments with similar characteristics in each university have held joint meetings to discuss curriculum, teaching methods, and other issues. Each university has decided to offer political courses, and Peking University has begun a series of weekly lectures on revolutionary theory. Faculty and students at each university have launched discussions on issues such as department and faculty adjustments, and the academic system. Each department and relevant organization has also gradually established contacts. For example, Peking University's Medical School has established business contacts with health departments, and Tsinghua and Peking University's science and engineering departments have established business contacts with enterprise departments. Since the merger of the Municipal Liberal Arts College, the Science Department of China University, and other institutions into Peking Normal University, school affairs have also improved. Professors at each university have expressed enthusiasm for improving the curriculum and teaching. In addition to many students from the faculties of arts and law joining the Southbound Work Corps and applying to North China University and Revolutionary University, the current number of students is as follows: Peking University has 2,366 students (947 in the faculties of arts and law, 1,342 in the faculties of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, and 77 vocational students, etc.); Tsinghua has 1,824 students (1,402 in the faculties of science, engineering, and agriculture, and 422 in the faculties of arts and law); and Peking Normal University has 1,308 students. Students' enthusiasm for studying politics and their major is generally high, and they have begun to adopt new learning methods, such as group discussions. Faculty, staff, and police have also organized study groups. Salary scales and People's Scholarships have been announced and adjusted at each university. In order to strengthen the collective leadership of each university and to promote and improve school affairs more effectively, the Cultural Takeover Committee has decided to establish University Affairs Committees for the three universities. It has proposed the appointment of Tang Yongtong and 22 others, Ye Qisun and 20 others, and Li Jinxi and 18 others as members of the University Affairs Committees of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Peking Normal University, respectively. At the same time, it has also announced the new candidates for administrative heads of each university, such as deans of academic affairs, secretaries-general, deans of faculties, and library directors.
