Suggestions for Private Banks and Money Shops in Beijing and Tianjin

　　Since the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the private banks and money shops in both cities have been filled with suspicion and unease regarding the policies of the People's Government. How exactly would the People's Government deal with private banks and money shops? Would they be allowed to exist? The "Provisional Measures for the Management of Private Banks and Money Shops in the North China Region" were announced last month on the 27th, providing a positive answer to the question of whether they would be allowed to exist, alleviating concerns about being forced to shut down. However, the question that immediately followed was how they should exist. Regarding this question, my personal opinions are as follows:

　　First, private banks and money shops in Beijing and Tianjin should acknowledge that their past business operations were detached from production. Not only did they not serve the development of production, but they also hindered and disrupted production activities. This can be evidenced by the following two pieces of information:

　　(1) According to the statistics from the Peiping Branch of the Puppet Central Bank regarding the sources of deposits and objects of loans of sixteen banks (excluding the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) and seventeen money shops in Peiping in the 35th year of the Republic of China: the total deposits amounted to 14,604,098,685.45 yuan, of which personal deposits accounted for 46.77% and business deposits accounted for 27.75%, totaling 74.52%. Deposits from agricultural, industrial, and mining production enterprises accounted for only 2.37%, and deposits from public utilities accounted for only 1.98%, totaling only 4.35%. The total loans amounted to 10,102,038,626.75 yuan, of which the main borrowers were businesses, accounting for 77.76%, followed by individuals, accounting for 12.17%, totaling 89.93%. Agricultural, industrial, and mining production enterprises accounted for only 4.19%, and public utilities accounted for only 2.18%, totaling only 6.37%. Of course, the comprehensiveness of this data is still worth considering, and the extent varies from bank to bank, but it is undeniable that the private banks and money shops in Peiping were detached from the development of production and did not serve the development of production.

　　(2) At the beginning of the liberation of Tianjin, according to the incomplete statistics reported by the banks and money shops themselves regarding their inventory of materials: there were 1,652.5 taels of gold, 219 taels of silver, 1,164 silver dollars, 1,571 foreign currencies, 5,488 bags of flour, 757 bags of rice, 6,944 bolts of cotton cloth, 36.5 pieces of cotton yarn, 221 bags of sugar, 341 bags of alkali, 397 barrels of dyes, and other hardware, groceries, and medicines. Originally, a bank or money shop is a financial institution that engages in currency credit transactions, but its inventory of materials was so extensive in variety and so large in quantity (actually far exceeding these numbers) that it is difficult to believe that they were not engaged in speculation and hoarding in the past. The consequences of these behaviors and the harm they brought to the broad masses of people are incalculable.

　　Of course, the rulers of old China, especially the reactionary Kuomintang rule of the past ten years or so, provided extremely harsh conditions for the survival of private banks and money shops in old China. These conditions only facilitated the plunder of the broad masses of people by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, hindering the development of production and forcing most national capital to move out of the field of production and into speculative ventures. The general trend of private banks and money shops towards financial speculation and other speculative ventures also has its objective reasons. The reactionary Kuomintang rule should be mainly responsible for this, but the private bankers and money changers in Beijing and Tianjin should recognize the fact that they have aided and abetted wrongdoing, especially the harm they have inflicted on the broad masses of people in the past. Today, after liberation, they should change course and fulfill their due responsibility in the new democratic economic construction—putting the funds they control firmly on the basis of developing production in order to seek a legitimate way out.

　　Secondly, private banks and money shops should faithfully abide by the policies and laws of the democratic government. In accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Private Banks and Money Shops in the North China Region," they should promptly apply for registration with the government, establish close contact with the management authority—the People's Bank of China, actively engage in legitimate businesses permitted by the government under their guidance and supervision to regulate social funds and serve the production enterprises of workers, peasants, and merchants, and immediately and resolutely terminate the remaining acts of speculation and hoarding and improper practices—such as continuing to maintain business secrets and using two or more sets of books—so as to establish themselves on a correct foundation. The specific methods are:

　　(1) At present, what should and can be done is to focus on legitimate businesses such as deposits, loans, and remittances, emphasizing those that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood in industry, agriculture, and commerce. They should cautiously absorb deposits and prudently handle loans, without taking profit-making as the sole purpose and neglecting the interests of the broad masses of people.

　　(2) They should develop investment in industry and mining, especially those private banks and money shops with a long history and good reputation, should take the lead and set an example for their peers.

### 对平津私营银钱业的建议

　　对平津私营银钱业的建议
    平津解放后，两地私营银钱业对人民政府的政策，是充满怀疑和不安情绪的，人民政府对私营银钱业究竟怎么办？是否允许他们存在？上月二十七日，华北区私营银钱业管理暂行办法公布了，关于是否允许存在的问题得到了肯定的解答，不再忧虑会勒令停业了。但紧随而来的是应该如何存在的问题，关于这个问题，个人的意见如下：
    首先，平津私营银钱业应该承认：过去的业务经营，是与生产脱离，非但不是为发展生产而服务，而且对生产事业起着妨碍和破坏的作用的，这可由下面两个材料得到明证。
    （一）根据伪中央银行北平分行关于三十五年度北平十六家银行（中中交农在外）十七家银号存款来源和放款对象的统计：在存款方面共一四、六○四、○九八、六八五·四五元，其中主要是个人存款占４６．７７％，和商号存款占２７．７５％，二者合计达７４．５２％，而农工矿生产事业存款仅占２．３７％，公用事业存款也只占１．９８％，二者合计仅只４．３５％。在放款方面共一○、一○二、○三八、六二六、七五元，其中主要对象是商号占７７．７６％，其次是个人占１２．１７％，二者合计达８９．９３％。而农工矿生产事业仅４．１９％，公用事业只２．１８％，二者合计只６．３７％。当然这个材料的全面性还值得考虑，且就各行庄讲来程度上也各有区别，但拿来说明北平的私营银钱业与发展生产的脱离，不是为发展生产而服务，乃是无可置辩的。
    （二）天津解放之初，据各行庄自报所存物资的不完全统计：有黄金一、六五二·五两，白银二一九两，银元一、一六四元，外币一、五七一元，面粉五、四八八袋，大米七五七包，棉布六、九四四匹，棉纱三六·五件，糖二二一包，碱面三四一包，染料三九七桶，此外尚有五金、杂货、药品等，本来银钱业是一个经营货币信用授受的金融机构，其所存物资，种类如此之广，数量又如此之多（实际上要远超过此数），要说他们过去不是投机囤积，则难令人相信。这些行为所引起的后果，和给广大人民所带来的危害是不可计算的。
    当然旧中国的统治者，特别十余年来反动的国民党统治，给旧中国私营银钱业的生存条件也是极端恶劣的，这些条件只是便利于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义对广大人民的掠夺，阻碍了生产发展，使大部民族资本不得不走出生产领域，而转向投机事业，一般私营银钱业之走向金融投机及其他投机事业也同样有其客观原因，这主要的应由反动的国民党统治来负责，但在平津的私营银钱业者，就应该认清自己曾助桀为虐的事实，特别是自己过去所加于广大人民的危害，而在解放后的今天，就应改弦更辙，在新民主主义经济建设中尽自己应尽的一份责任-把掌握的资金端正的放在发展生产的基础之上，以求正当的出路。
    其次是私营银钱业应该忠实的遵守民主政府的政策法令，按照华北区私营银钱业管理暂行办法的规定，迅速的向政府办理申请登记，与管理机关--中国人民银行取得密切联系，在他们的指导和监督下积极经营政府所允许的正当业务，以调剂社会资金，为工农商生产事业服务，并立即坚决终止那些投机囤积的残余行为和不正派的作风--如继续保留营业秘密、使用两套以至更多套帐簿等，从而使自己建立在正确的基础之上，具体的作法是：
    （一）目前应该也可能努力作的是存放汇兑等正当业务，应多着重于那些有利于国计民生的工农商业，谨慎的吸收存款，稳重的办理放款，不要以营利为唯一目的，而忽视了广大人民的利益。
    （二）向工矿业投资方面发展，特别是那些历史较久、信誉较好的私营行庄，应该首先以身作则，为同业的倡导。
