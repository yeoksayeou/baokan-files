Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th—The spokesperson of the Taiyuan Front Headquarters recently issued the following comments on the great victory of the liberation of Taiyuan:
    We executed Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De’s order of April 21st, sweeping away the enemy around Taiyuan with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Immediately afterwards, we launched a general offensive at dawn on the 24th and, in only five hours, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated the enemy defending Taiyuan. This is the most effective punishment for the Kuomintang reactionaries who dared to resist the People's Liberation Army and refused to resolve domestic problems peacefully. We exercised the greatest patience towards the enemy in Taiyuan, making no less than a dozen requests to them for a peaceful resolution, but these were all brazenly rejected by war criminals Yan Xishan, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Liang Huazhi, and others. They were confident that the fortress fortifications built by the Japanese invaders and the bandit Yan over more than ten years were impregnable, that the one hundred plus strongholds, more than two thousand reinforced concrete bunkers, over seven hundred artillery pieces, the terrain favorable for defense and unfavorable for attack, the strength of nineteen infantry divisions, Japanese technology, and the assistance of their American masters would enable them to continue their counter-revolutionary war to the end. American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries both touted Taiyuan as a "model anti-communist fortress," wanting all reactionaries to learn from it. However, under the attack of the People's Liberation Army, this "fortress" was crushed in just four days. This fully proves that the power of the people is irresistible, that we can capture wherever we want to capture, and that no so-called permanent fortifications and powerful firepower can stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army. Any Kuomintang local reactionary group that listens to the orders of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's diehards and learns from this "model anti-communist fortress" is bound to be unlucky.
    Another important significance of the liberation of Taiyuan is that it removed the largest remaining stronghold of the enemy in North China, making North China a more consolidated rear area and providing the people with an important industrial base in North China, especially heavy industry and munitions industry. This will facilitate the people's rapid recovery of their construction endeavors and favorably support the People's Liberation War.
    Taiyuan is one of China's leading military fortress areas, and the Battle of Taiyuan was a typical positional warfare. We were able to quickly and completely annihilate the enemy in Taiyuan at a minimal cost for the following important reasons:
    1. We implemented the instructions of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission on the Taiyuan operation, implemented the military guiding principles of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and based on these instructions, determined our operational guiding principle, which was to divide and encircle the enemy on the periphery, conduct continuous attacks, strive to annihilate all or most of the enemy, occupy favorable positions for attacking the city, and then capture the city in one fell swoop. All corps completed this task very well. Many troops, disregarding the threat of enemy flanking fire, boldly inserted themselves into the enemy's depths from between the enemy's bunker complexes at long distances, cutting off their retreat and annihilating twelve entire divisions in one fell swoop. They also used rapid and mobile actions to greatly expand the results of the battle, directly approaching the city, leaving the enemy no room to breathe. The enemy planned to retreat step by step and fight a decisive battle with us in the core area, but we had already occupied key points in their rear, causing the enemy's entire defense line to collapse completely and uncontrollably within ten hours.
    2. We had the direct support of the broad masses of the people and rear organizations in the liberated areas of North China and Jin-Sui. From the beginning of the siege of Taiyuan last October to the liberation of Taiyuan, the number of civilian laborers supporting the war reached over ten million, transporting over 60 million catties of ammunition and combat equipment and over 400 million catties of grain and fuel. During this period, we also overcame difficulties such as the lack of housing, roads, and drinking water. The army and the people cooperated to jointly open up and repair 600 li of roads, build tens of thousands of cave dwellings, survive the severe winter, and complete the task of a half-year siege.
    3. Our firepower was active during the battle. The three major corps of North China, parts of the Northwest Field Army, the Northeast Artillery Corps, and the Jinzhong Military Region troops joined together and fought side by side. Our army's powerful force made it impossible for the enemy to resist. At the same time, the three regional troops fully demonstrated their conscious fraternal unity, which was also an important feature of this operation.
    4. Enemy officers and soldiers were generally unwilling to fight, and even entire regiments and battalions laid down their weapons on the front lines. This is a manifestation of the high degree of hatred of the broad masses of people and soldiers for the nearly forty years of feudal rule by the Yan Xishan bandit gang, and also reflects the disintegration within the reactionary ruling class. In addition, since the Linfen and Jinzhong campaigns, especially the siege of Taiyuan, we have greatly weakened and disintegrated the enemy's forces militarily and politically, creating favorable conditions for us to annihilate the bandit Yan in one fell swoop. The capture of the Taiyuan fortress has further enriched our experience in attacking fortified positions. We will have more confidence and assurance in capturing any firmly defended city that dares to resist. We will continue to bravely advance and resolutely complete the glorious and sacred task given to us by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on April 21st.

    太原前线司令部发言人
    评解放太原的巨大胜利
    敢于拒绝和平解决国内问题的国民党反动派，必受到与阎匪同样的惩罚。
    【新华社太原二十九日电】太原前线司令部发言人顷对解放太原的巨大胜利，发表评论如下：
    我们执行毛主席、朱德司令四月二十一日命令，以秋风扫落叶之势，肃清太原外围之敌，紧接着于二十四日拂晓发起总攻，只有五个钟头，就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭了太原守敌。这是对敢于反抗人民解放军，拒绝用和平方法解决国内问题的国民党反动派，以最有效的惩罚。对于太原之敌，我们曾作到了最大的忍耐，何止十数次向他们提出和平解决的要求，但均为战犯阎锡山、孙楚、王靖国、梁化之等所悍然拒绝。他们满以为经过日寇和阎匪十余年经营的要塞工事是不可被攻破的，以为一百多个坚固据点，两千多钢骨水泥碉堡，七百余门大炮，利守不利攻的地形，十九个步兵师的兵力，日本人的技术，加上其美国主子的援助，将能支持它的反革命战争进行到底，美帝国主义和国民党反动派都把太原吹嘘为“反共模范堡垒”，要一切反动派向它学习，但在人民解放军的攻击下，这个“堡垒”只有四天工夫就被粉碎。这就充分证明人民力量是不可抗拒的，要攻占哪里就能攻占哪里，任何所谓永久性工事和强大火力，都无法阻止人民解放军的胜利前进。任何国民党地方反动集团，如果要听从美帝国主义和蒋介石死党的命令，向这个“反共模范堡垒”学习，是非倒霉不可的。
    太原解放另一个重要意义，就是它拔除了华北敌人残留的一个最大据点，将使华北成为更加巩固的后方，使人民在华北获得一个重要的工业基地，特别是重工业和军火工业，这将便利人民迅速恢复自己的建设事业，有利地支援人民解放战争。
    太原是中国有数的军事要塞区，太原之战是典型的阵地战，我们能以微小的代价，迅速全歼太原之敌有以下几个重要原因：
    一、我们执行了中国人民革命军事委员会对太原作战的指示，贯彻了毛主席、朱总司令的军事指导原则，并根据这些指示，确定了我们的战役指导方针，是分割包围外围之敌，进行连续攻击，争取歼灭敌全部或大部，占领攻城有利阵地，尔后一举攻城。各兵团对这一任务，都完成得很好，许多部队不顾敌侧射火力的威胁，从敌碉堡群之间，大胆的远距离的插入敌纵深，切断其归路，一举歼其十二个整师，并以迅速机动的动作，高度的扩张战果，直迫城下，使敌毫无喘息余地。敌计划节节撤退，在核心区与我决战，但我已先占其后方要点，使敌整个防线，在十小时内完全崩溃，不可收拾。
    二、我们有华北、晋绥等解放区广大人民和后方机关的直接支援，从去年十月围困太原开始至太原解放止，支援参战民工达一千万工以上，运送之弹药及作战器材，达六千余万斤，粮食燃料四万万斤以上。在此期内，我们还克服了房屋、道路、饮水等缺乏的困难，军民合作，共同开辟与修补了六百里公路，构筑了数万窑洞，渡过严冬，完成了半年围困的任务。
    三、战斗中我火力活跃。华北三大兵团，西北野战军、东北炮兵各一部，和晋中军区部队会合一起，并肩作战。我军如此强大的威力，使敌人无法抗拒。同时我三个地区部队，充分表现了自觉的兄弟的团结，亦是此次作战的重要特色。
    四、敌人军官和士兵普遍地不愿作战，甚至整团整营的在火线上放下武器，这是广大人民士兵群众，对阎锡山匪帮近四十年封建统治的高度仇恨的表现，也反映出反动统治阶级内部的分崩离析。此外，自临汾晋中等战役，特别是围困太原作战以来，我们曾在军事上、政治上极大的削弱与瓦解了敌人的力量，创造了我们一举全歼阎匪的有利条件。太原要塞的攻占，更加丰富了我们攻坚作战的经验，我们将更有信心，有把握攻占一切敢于抵抗的任何坚固设防的城市。我们将继续奋勇前进，坚决完成毛主席朱总司令四月二十一日给我们的光荣神圣的任务。
