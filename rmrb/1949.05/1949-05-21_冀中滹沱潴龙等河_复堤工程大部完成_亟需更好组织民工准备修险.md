　　Jizhong Hutuo, Zhulong, and other Rivers
  　Embankment Restoration Project Mostly Completed
    Urgent Need for Better Organization of Laborers to Prepare for Repairing Dangers
    [Our Newspaper’s Report] The Jizhong embankment restoration is mostly completed, and preparations for repairing dangers are underway. Before the spring construction, five surveying teams were organized and dispatched to the Hutuo, Long, Nan'yun, Ziya, and Yongding rivers for construction surveying, which was completed successively by April 25th. They have now been incorporated into the spring construction headquarters of each river and are transitioning to supervision. The current status of material preparation for danger works and the current status of embankment restoration projects on each river are as follows: In the Nan'yun River area, Qingxian, Cangxian and other counties have prepared 650,000 bricks, and the vast majority of the embankment restoration project was completed on May 2nd. For the Hutuo River, Anping, Raoyang and other counties have purchased one-half of the required materials. The Wumaoying section of the embankment restoration commenced on the 28th. The Yongding River is in its ice-melting period, and 200,000 catties of reeds have been purchased. In order to ensure the completion of the spring construction before the major floods, the headquarters is actively preparing materials in conjunction with relevant areas (Changxindian District). In the Zhulong River area, Boxian and other counties have prepared all the pile materials, and the embankment restoration commenced on April 9th and was completed by the end of the month. In the Daqing River area, Xiongxian, Baxian and other counties have prepared 214,500 bricks, with a shortage of 164,500 bricks; 415,600 catties of reeds have been prepared, with a shortage of 150,000 catties; 760 piles have been prepared, with a shortage of 700 piles. For the Ziya River, 70% of the earthwork for the Wangkou diversion canal commenced on May 1st, and the embankment restoration projects such as Nan Zhaofu and Shahe Bridge have been completed. According to the inspection results before and after construction, this year has indeed taken a big step forward, but there are still serious shortcomings in terms of labor organization and engineering quality: In the Nan Zhaofu embankment restoration in Dacheng, 400 laborers were distributed to 60 villages, with an average of fewer than seven laborers sent from each village, and no village cadres participated, resulting in extremely low effectiveness. In Wang Shibaocun village, eight laborers were sent, five old and two small. In Wan Jiazhuangzi in Cangxian, which is ten li away from the embankment, shifts are changed daily, resulting in a great waste of labor. The problem of combining earthwork and ramming work was not properly addressed because the cadres' thinking was not fully unified beforehand, and the organization and publicity work was not sufficient. After the work started, it was found that it did not meet the requirements. Although an emergency notice was issued, it still did not achieve the desired results. For example, in the four- or five-li long section of Niuxinzhuang, which borders Qingxian and Cangxian, only soil was carried on the first day without any ramming. Similar situations also occurred in the Ninth District, which seriously affected the quality of the project. In addition to notifying the Jizhong Water Conservancy Bureau to find ways to remedy the situation, the North China Water Conservancy Committee hopes that all localities will pay attention.

　　冀中滹沱潴龙等河
  　复堤工程大部完成
    亟需更好组织民工准备修险
    【本报讯】冀中复堤大部完成，修险正备料中。春工施工前组织五个测量队，分赴滹沱、龙、南运、子牙、永定等五河进行施工测量，至四月二十五日先后完成。现并入各河春工指挥部转入监工。现各河险工备料情形及复堤工程现况如下：南运河青、沧等县已备砖六十五万块，复堤工程绝大部分已在五月二日完成。滹沱河安平、饶阳等县所需物料已购买二分之一，伍毛营一段复堤，于二十八日动工。永定河在凌泛期，买苇料二十万斤，为了保证大泛前完成春工，指挥部正与有关地区（长辛店区）积极备料中。潴龙河博野等县桩料已备齐，复堤于四月九日动工，月底完成。大清河雄、霸等县已备砖二十一万四千五百块，尚缺十六万四千五百块；已备苇料四十一万五千六百斤，尚缺十五万斤；已备桩料七百六十棵，尚缺七百棵。子牙河占十分之七的王口引河土工，已于五月一日动工，复堤工程如南赵扶、沙河桥均已完成。根据施工前后检查结果，今年确已向前大大前进了一步，但在民工组织方面，工程质量方面，仍存在着严重缺点：大城南赵扶复堤四百个民工分配到六十个村，每村平均出工不足七人，没一个村干部参加，效果极低。王实保村去八个民工，五老二小。沧县万家庄子，离堤十里，每天换班，浪费民工很大。土工与夯工结合问题，因事前干部思想未完全打通，组织宣传工作作的不够，开工后发现不合要求，虽发出紧急通知，仍未作到好处，如青沧交县牛辛庄四、五里的长段，第一天只担土没行夯，九分区也有类似情形，严重地影响了工程质量。华北水利委员会除已通知冀中水利局设法补救外，希各地引起注意。（达三）
