    A Few Words
    Wang Qingquan Dismissed
    Wang Qingquan was originally a poor peasant. After liberation, he became the village head. Logically, he should have served the peasants well, so that his poor brothers would no longer be oppressed by the ruling class. However, Wang Qingquan was infected with an extremely strong Kuomintang style. Once he became the village head, he forgot his roots, accepted bribes privately, allowed bad elements to infiltrate the people's village government, oppressed the peasants, acted like a tyrant, and deliberately wasted public funds and manpower, causing the people's village government to be seriously detached from the masses, and undermining the prestige of the people's regime among the masses. Such bad phenomena must not be allowed to exist. Wang Qingquan has now been removed from his post as village head and is being kept in the farmers' association to reflect and review. This is absolutely necessary. From this, we should learn a lesson, that is, we must strengthen the education of new district cadres, so that they can understand the Party's policies and serve the people honestly. Otherwise, even if the composition of the new cadres is good, if their class consciousness is not raised, and if there is no supervision from the broad masses, they may be softened by the old forces.
    Zhang Shiqian's Fate
    This newspaper published on May 4 that Zhang Shiqian, the squad leader of the Changxindian Public Security Sub-bureau, and others arbitrarily tying up and beating workers was a Kuomintang style. These people have forgotten that the People's Government is completely different from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the Kuomintang rule, police officers extorted openly, arbitrarily tied up and beat the people, climbed on the people's heads to shit and piss, and the people, when seeing the police, dared not utter a sound, acting with caution like they were dealing with gods. But today is the people's country, the people's government, and such phenomena of oppressing the people must never be allowed to exist. Public security personnel, like personnel in other departments of the People's Government, must not only refrain from beating and scolding the people, but are merely the people's servants. If they are infected with this Kuomintang style, they must thoroughly correct it, otherwise they will only be punished like Zhang Shiqian. All personnel who have or are infected with Kuomintang ideology and style should remember this lesson.

    三言两语
    王清泉被撤职
    王清泉本是贫农，解放后当了乡长，依理应该好好给农民办事，使穷苦兄弟不再受统治阶级的压迫才对。可是，王清泉却沾染了极浓厚的国民党作风，当了乡长就忘了本，私自接受贿赂，让坏分子混入人民的乡政府，欺压农民，作威作福，故意浪费民财民力，使人民的乡政府严重的脱离群众，破坏了人民政权在群众中的威信。这种恶劣现象，是决不能容许存在的。王清泉现被撤销乡长职务，留农会反省检讨，这是完全必要的，从此，我们应领得一个教训，即对新区干部必须加强教育，使其认识党的政策，老老实实为人民服务。否则新的干部成份虽好，如果不提高其阶级觉悟，如果没有广大群众的监督，就有可能被旧势力所软化。
    张世谦的下场
    本报五月四日发表长辛店公安分局分队长张世谦等随便捆打工人是一种国民党作风，这些人忘记了人民政府与国民党反动派统治迥然不同。国民党统治时代，警察人员勒索公行，可以任意捆打鱼肉人民，爬在人民头上拉屎拉尿，人民见了警察莫不“敬鬼神而远之”，从不敢啃一声大气。但是今天是人民的国家，人民的政府，就绝不能容许这种欺压人民的现象存在。公安人员和人民政府其他部门的人员一样，不仅不能打骂人民，而只是人民的勤务员。如果沾染了这种国民党作风，就必须痛切的加以改过，否则只有象张世谦一样受到惩办。一切带有或沾染了国民党思想作风的人员，应该记取这次教训。
