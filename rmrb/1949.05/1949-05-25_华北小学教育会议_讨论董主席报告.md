　　North China Primary Education Conference

　　Discusses Chairman Dong’s Report

　　[Our Newspaper] The North China Primary Education Conference, which commenced with an opening ceremony on the 20th at the Peking Union Medical College Auditorium, immediately began group activities to discuss Chairman Dong’s report and study the draft of the Provisional Implementation Measures for Primary Education in the North China Region. It is scheduled to hold a general discussion on the draft of the Provisional Implementation Measures today (the 25th). During the group discussions on Chairman Dong's report, participants made in-depth discussions in light of the situation and experience in the region. Regarding the issue of a unified system, everyone unanimously felt that North China has now entered a stage of peaceful construction, and various localities urgently need to summarize their experiences and make unified regulations to meet future needs and improve education work. On the other hand, there should also be flexibility to take into account the different conditions of urban and rural areas, mountainous and plain areas, and new and old areas. Regarding the great achievements of primary education during the past war years, each group mentioned:

　　Under the New Democratic education, primary school students have demonstrated the infinite power of patriotic enthusiasm. They not only undertook specific tasks such as guarding, sentry duty, guiding, delivering messages, comforting troops, and reconnaissance, but also enlivened the political and cultural life of the countryside, making the songs of resistance resonate throughout the villages. Primary education has also enabled a large number of children to enter middle school to study and become intellectuals, enabling them to quickly embark on the front lines of the patriotic war, exerting tremendous power, and cultivating many cadres above the village level. There have also been many achievements in the creation of educational work, such as in Tanhuipu in Fuping, Baishiling in Laiyuan, Nanying Village in Laishui, and Liuhecheng in Dongguanshang, Fangshan. In extremely dispersed and impoverished mountainous areas, they created large-scale mobile teaching covering fifty to sixty li, distributing education to many small natural villages scattered within fifty to sixty li. This has never happened in the history of education and is impossible for the old education system. The Peking and Tianjin groups exchanged experiences on issues such as uniting and transforming the thinking of faculty and staff and organizing the Teachers' Union to hold training classes. The groups then studied the draft of the Provisional Implementation Measures for Primary Education in the North China Region. She Zengshou, Principal of the First Primary School Affiliated to the Normal University, and Sun Yu, Principal of the Second Primary School Affiliated to the Normal University, also participated. Each group conducted in-depth research on the principles, academic system, curriculum time teaching, organizational structure, and leadership settings stipulated in the draft. When the Presidium reported and studied the opinions of the group discussions, Comrade Xu Teli, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and veteran educator, made a special trip to attend and provide guidance.

　　Furthermore, Wu Daping and three others from the Education Department of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Government arrived in Peking on the evening of the 23rd to participate in the conference.

　　华北小学教育会议
  　讨论董主席报告
    【本报讯】华北小学教育会议，自二十日在北平协和礼堂举行开幕典礼后，即进行小组活动，讨论董主席报告及研究华北区小学教育暂行实施办法草案，预定今日（二十五日）举行暂行实施办法草案的大会讨论。小组在讨论董主席报告时，联系本区情况及经验，作了深入讨论。关于统一制度问题，大家一致感到华北今日进入和平建设阶段，各地迫切需要总结各地经验，作出统一的规定，以适应今后的需要，把教育工作提高一步；但另一方面，也要有灵活性，照顾到城市乡村、山地平原、新区老区的不同情况，关于小学教育在过去战争时期的伟大成就，各组谈到：
    小学生在新民主主义教育下发挥了爱国热忱的无限力量，他们不但担任了站岗、放哨、带路、送信、慰劳、侦察等具体工作，并且活跃了乡村的政治文化生活，使抗战歌声响遍了农村。小学教育又使大批孩子进入中学学习，培养成知识分子，使他们很快的走上爱国战争的战线上，发挥巨大力量，培养了许许多多村以上的干部，在教育工作的创造上亦有很多成就，如阜平炭灰铺、涞源白石岭、涞水南颖村、房山东关上六合城等，极度分散贫穷的山地，创造了五六十里的大巡回教学，把教育分送到散布五六十里内的许多小自然村，这些在教育史上是从来没有的，也是为旧教育所办不到的。北平天津组就团结改造教职员思想及组织教联会举办讲习班等问题，交换了经验。各小组继即研究华北区小学教育暂行实施办法草案，师大第一附小校长佘增寿、第二附小校长孙钰亦来参加。各组对草案中所规定的方针、学制、课程时间教导工作、组织编制会议、设置领导等，均作了深入的研究，在主席团汇报、研究各小组讨论意见时，中共中央委员老教育家徐特立同志特赶来出席指导。
    又讯：绥蒙政府教育处长武达平等四人，于二十三日晚抵平参加会议。
