Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: Paris dispatch: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 19th, presided over by Thorez, to discuss the financial and economic situation in France. The meeting passed a resolution denouncing the French government's attempt to make up for the huge deficit caused by massive military expansion by levying new taxes, raising gasoline prices, and reducing non-military expenditures. The French fiscal deficit has now reached 183.9 billion francs. The resolution pointed out that France's financial difficulties are the result of the government's war policy placing an excessive burden on the country. The Political Bureau opposes the government's intention to levy new taxes on the people. The Political Bureau authorized the Communist parliamentary group to oppose the government's plan and put forward a counter-proposal, demanding a significant reduction in war appropriations. The Political Bureau called on party members to carry out activities under the slogan of united action to defend the demands of the working people. The Political Bureau expressed its firm belief that the people of Paris will actively participate in the traditional May 29th demonstration in front of the Wall of the Communards to commemorate the immortal fighters of the Paris Commune, resolutely declare the will of the people of Paris to defend peace, and reiterate their sympathy for their Soviet brothers who have realized the ideals of the members of the Paris Commune.
