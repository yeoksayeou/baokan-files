Central Hebei, Southern Hebei
Dig Wells to Prevent Drought and Plant Seeds

  [Central Hebei Electric] Under the leadership of party members and members of the Communist Youth League, farmers in various parts of central Hebei are actively digging wells to prevent drought and planting cotton. In Renqiu, many villages have begun to abandon the idea of waiting for rain, preventing drought and preparing for famine by digging wells in shady areas. Women in Dawangguo Village in the Eighth District are also participating in men's well-digging teams. From April 15th to April 17th, according to incomplete statistics from seven villages including Dawangguo Village, Tian Village, and Beima Village, 40 new wells were dug. In the Tenth District, Shizhuang, Nanbeilingcheng and three villages have completed fifteen wells. In villages along the Guyang River in the Tenth District, farmers have already harrowed the land flat. Due to convenient access to water, cotton planting has begun along the embankments. Farmers in Dongtun Village, Xian County, were concerned that well-digging would not work in sandy and alkaline land. Village cadres took the lead in experimenting, and after digging four wells, the farmers gained confidence. Jia Baoxing and Jia Hongru from Tabeitou Village, Renhepu, created an experience for digging wells in sandy areas: that is, to circle reed fences as they dig to prevent the sand from flowing and collapsing. The Fifth District Committee of the county convened a meeting of party members and cadres in the entire district to specifically study the issue of digging wells and planting seeds, and put forward the slogan "Human Power Can Conquer Nature." Party members of the Xiaopei Village Branch in Yecheng took the lead in organizing ten mutual aid groups (a total of forty-two households) and began planting seeds in shady areas.

  [Southern Hebei Electric] The Southern Hebei Daily recently published a short commentary entitled "Overcome Spring Drought and Implement Rush Planting," calling on cadres and the masses to overcome the idea of waiting for rain and the paralyzing phenomenon of being unconcerned about the spring drought, and to immediately mobilize to carry out rush planting. The short commentary pointed out that the focus of work should be on helping the masses solve the difficulties in planting; such as organizing mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power; organizing the repair of wells to solve the difficulty of water sources, etc.; now the leadership in some counties has urgently arranged for watering and planting, and farmers in more than ten counties including Weixian, Yongzhi, and Qiuxian have begun a blitz of planting. Party members of the Yangjiazhuang Branch in the Fourth District took the lead in digging forty earthen wells to solve the problem of water sources, and planting has generally begun in the village. In Xinzhuang and Dingzhuang area of the Second District of Chengci, a large number of planting tools such as well ropes, water buckets, and water buckets were repaired and purchased in advance. Because the old wells were unusable, earthen wells were dug. Jiangguan Village has dug two wells, and more than 20 people in Dingzhuang have mutually assisted in digging wells. Villages in Qiu County have come up with various methods to prevent drought and sow seeds, such as digging deep ditches in the eastern Bao to wait for the seedlings to emerge, then pulling out the dry soil on top. Some sow seeds soaked for half a month, and sow them when they germinate and are the size of sesame seeds. Both of these methods can produce complete germination. The village planted 800 mu of cotton, and 602 people worked together and completed the plowing in two days. However, it is understood that at present, the leaders of many counties and districts are turning a blind eye to the spring drought, and have not yet put forward any measures to prevent drought and rush planting to this day. In addition, the farmers rely on the heavens and other superstitious ideas and are unwilling to plant. Some county and district cadres are wavering about completing the planting plan. These ideological obstacles are being overcome.

  　冀中　冀南
  　挖井防旱点种
    【冀中电】冀中各地农民，正在党员、团员的带动下，积极挖井防旱，点种棉花。任邱不少村庄农民，开始打破等雨思想，防旱备荒，挖井阴地。八区大王果庄妇女也参加男子打井组去打井。自四月十五日至四月十七日两天，据大王果庄、田庄、北马等七村不完全的统计，就打成新井四十眼。十区史庄、南北陵城三个村，已完成十五眼井。十区沿古洋河村庄，农民早已将土地打耙平坦，由于取水便利，沿堤已开始点种棉花。献县东屯村农民，顾虑沙地碱地挖井不行，村干部带头先作了试验，挖成四眼后，农民有了信心。任河铺塔北头村贾宝兴和贾洪如，创造出沙地挖井的经验：就是随挖随圈苇囤子，使沙不流不易塌坏。该县五区区委，召开了全区党员干部会，专门研究挖井点种的问题，提出了“人力胜天”的口号。叶城小裴村支部党员，带动组织了十个互助组（共四十二户），开始阴地点种。
    【冀南电】冀南日报顷以“克服春旱实行抢种点种”为题发表短论，号召干部群众克服等雨思想及对春旱毫不关心的麻痹现象，立即动员起来展开抢种点种。短论指出：工作重点要放在帮助群众解决点种中的困难；如组织互助，解决人畜力困难；组织修理水井，以解决水源困难等；现在部分县份领导上已紧急布置浇水点种，威县、永智、邱县等十余县农民，已开始了突击点种。四区杨家庄支部党员带头挖土井四十眼，解决水源困难，全村普遍开始点种。成磁二区辛庄、丁庄一带，事前大量修购了点种工具，如井绳、水担、水桶等。因旧井不能用，即挖土井，姜管村已挖好两眼，丁庄已有二十余人互助挖井。邱县各村想出种种办法防旱播种，如镇东保普遍深沟，等苗出土时，扒出上面干土，有的耩前半月泡上种籽，等到发芽象芝麻大小才下种，这两种方法均能出芽齐全。该村种棉八百亩，六百零二人齐动手，两天即耕完。但据了解，目前尚有不少县、区领导对春旱熟视无睹，时至今日尚未提出防旱抢种办法，加以农民靠天等雨等迷信思想的存在，不愿点种，有的县、区干部对完成种植计划发生动摇等，这些思想障碍正在克服中。
