　　American Social Kaleidoscope
　　America's Astounding Waste—Liquor, Sex, Wealth, and Temper
    (1) There are 50 million drinkers in the United States, consuming 190 million gallons of liquor annually, worth $8.7 billion. American liquor merchants spend $30 million annually on advertising. Among the 50 million drinkers, 3 million are excessive drinkers, and 750,000 suffer from alcoholism. Therefore, Americans spend $13 million annually to treat alcoholics, $25 million to detain drunkards, and the losses caused by crimes due to drunkenness amount to $175 million annually.
    (2) Americans consume 350 billion cigarettes, 5.3 billion cigars, and 300 million pounds of tobacco annually.
    (3) Americans spend a total of $700 million annually on cosmetics.
    (4) In 1945, Americans spent $1.2 billion on jewelry.
    (5) In 1945, Americans spent $1.3 billion on building racetracks.
    (6) Americans spend a total of $125 million annually on fortune-telling.
　　High Rate of Juvenile Delinquency in the United States
    For the past two decades, there have been 1.5 million criminal cases annually in the United States, with 600,000 to 700,000 people arrested. The crime statistics for 1946 are as follows:
    Murder　　　　　　　　8,442 (cases)
    Manslaughter　　　　　　4,701
    Burglary　　　　　　357,991
    Rape　　　　　　　　12,117
    Aggravated Assault　　　　67,512
    Larceny　　　　　　941,738
    Robbery　　　　　　　　62,782
    Auto Theft　　　　　　229,920
    Total　　　　　1,685,203 cases
    Among criminals, the juvenile delinquency rate is particularly high and increasing year by year. In the 1944 crime statistics, robbery cases involving young men and women under the age of 21 accounted for 34.5%, burglary cases accounted for 51.8%, vagrancy accounted for 35.4%, and auto theft accounted for 63.1%. The rates of burglary and auto theft are even higher than those of adults.
　　Severe Housing Shortage in the United States—Using Electric Refrigerators as Bedrooms
    The United States has been plagued by a housing shortage for decades, especially after the recent war, with the demobilization of 13 million soldiers, the housing shortage has become even more severe. According to 1947 statistics, 3 million veterans alone were completely homeless, along with another 3.7 million homeless families. Some of these people lived with relatives, some were married but unable to live together, and some lived in cars, train stations, or set up tents on the grass. Strangely, one veteran lived in the window of a large company, and another actually lived in a refrigerator!
    Even Americans who have houses do not all live well. About a quarter of Americans live in substandard housing. According to a 1947 survey, 10.5 million families urgently needed to repair or renovate their homes.
　　American Fashion—Marriage and Divorce Like Child's Play
    In the United States, about 1.5 million people get married and 600,000 people get divorced each year. Comparing these two figures, one in three new couples divorces. Recently, the divorce rate has been increasing year by year. According to surveys, 40% of divorces are due to financial problems, 25% are due to infidelity, jealousy, and venereal diseases, 15% are due to abandonment, and 15% are due to alcoholism and cruelty.
　　So Many Illiterates in the United States—Teachers' Salaries Are Very Low
    According to official U.S. statistics, illiteracy accounts for 4.3% of the population, or 6 million people. However, in 1943, 13.9% of Americans who joined the army were illiterate. About 3 million adults in the United States have never attended school at all.
    Ten million American citizens are uneducated, and 350,000 can only sign with a mark. During the recent war, 676,000 people failed to be drafted due to their low level of education, and 2 million people were unable to enlist because they were illiterate.
    The salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers in the United States are too low (the average salary of teachers in 45 states is below the minimum standard), and the income tax is high, making life difficult, which has led to a shortage of teachers. Based on the U.S. population, there is a shortage of about 500,000 elementary and secondary school teachers. And among the existing teachers, 20% change careers every year. This has even affected the number of students attending teachers' colleges, which is decreasing.

　　美国社会万花筒
　　美国的惊人浪费—酒、色、财、气
    （一）美国的饮酒者达五千万人，每年消耗酒一亿九千万加伦，价值八十七亿元。美国酒商每年用于广告的费用达三千万元。五千万饮酒者中，三百万人过度酗酒，七十五万人患酒精中毒症。因此，美国人每年要花一千三百万元以作医治中酒毒者之费用，要花二千五百万元作为拘禁酗酒者之费用，而每年因酗酒而犯罪所造成的损失达一亿七千五百万元。
    （二）美国人每年消耗香烟三千五百亿支，雪茄五十三亿支，另烟叶三亿磅。
    （三）美国人每年消耗于化妆品上共七亿元。
    （四）一九四五年美国人花费于珠宝首饰上的是十二亿元。
    （五）一九四五年美国用于修建赛马用的跑马场者达十三亿元。
    （六）美国人每年花费于算命的钱共一亿二千五百万元。
　　美国青年犯罪多
    二十年来，美国每年总有一百五十万宗犯罪案件发生，有六七十万人被逮捕。一九四六年的犯罪统计如下：
    谋杀　　　　　　　　八、四四二（宗）
    无意杀人　　　　　　四、七○一
    夜盗　　　　　　三五七、九九一
    强奸　　　　　　　一二、一一七
    胁迫加害　　　　　六七、五一二
    小偷　　　　　　九四一、七三八
    抢劫　　　　　　　六二、七八二
    偷窃汽车　　　　二二九、九二○
    共计　　　　一、六八五、二○三宗
    在犯罪者间，青年犯罪率特高，且逐年增加。一九四四年犯罪统计中，二十一岁以下青年男女之抢劫案占三四·五％，夜盗案占五一·八％，浮浪罪占三五·四％偷窃汽车案占六三·一％。其中夜盗案，偷窃汽车案比成年人之犯罪率还高。
　　美国房慌严重—电气冰箱当寝室
    几十年来美国一直在闹房荒问题，尤其是这次大战之后，有一千三百万军人退伍，房荒问题就更严重。据一九四七年的统计，仅退伍军人即有三百万人完全没房子住，连同其他没房子住的人，一共三百七十万个家庭。这些人有的寄居在亲戚家，有的结了婚不能同居，有的就住在汽车里、火车站、在草地上搭帐幕。最奇怪的，有一个退伍军人住在一家大公司的橱窗里，另一个竟住到冷藏箱里去了！
    即使有房子住的美国人也不是都住得很好。约四分之一的美国人住的房子不合标准。据一九四七年的调查，亟需修理房屋或改建房屋的家庭达一千零五十万。
　　美国的时髦—结婚离婚似儿戏
    美国每年约有一百五十万以上的人结婚，有六十万人离婚。如果以这两个数字对比，则每三对新夫妇中便有一对离婚了。近来离婚率逐年增加。据调查，离婚的原因中百分之四十为金钱方面的问题，百分之二十五是由于不忠、嫉妒和性病，百分之十五由于遗弃，百分之十五由于酗酒与残忍。
　　美国文盲实在多—教师待遇低又低
    美国官方统计，美国文盲占人口百分之四·三，即六百万人。但一九四三年从军的美国人中却就有百分之十三·九的文盲。美国约有三百万成人根本未进过学校。
    美国有一千万公民毫无学识，有三十五万人，只能用记号来签名，这次大战中有六十七万六千人因文化程度太低在征兵时落选，有二百万人因不识字而不能入伍。
    美国中小学教员待遇太低（有四十五州教员平均待遇都在最低标准以下），所得税又高，生活较苦，使得师资缺乏。以美国人口计算中小学教员不足约五十万人之多。而现有教员中，每年有百分之二十转业。甚至影响到念师范学校的学生也日趋减少了。
