    New Chinese Painting Exhibition Opens Today
    [Ping City News] Fellow members of the Peiping Chinese painting circles, adhering to the spirit of art serving the people and breaking away from the past style of only catering to the appreciation of the leisure class, have held several symposiums and collectively discussed the issue of reforming Chinese painting. Later, they decided to hold a "New Chinese Painting Exhibition" as a preliminary attempt. After more than two months of preparation, more than 200 works were collected, with themes mostly focusing on labor production and the relationship between the military and the people. The exhibition opens today at the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park and will close on the 17th of this month. We hope that people from all walks of life will visit and offer criticism.

    新国画展览今日开幕
    【平市讯】北平国画界同人，本着艺术为人民服务的精神，脱离以往专供有闲阶级欣赏的作风，曾举行几次座谈会，集体讨论改造国画问题，后决定举行一次“新国画展览”，以作初步的尝试。筹备两月余，征集作品两百余幅，内容多以劳动生产及军民关系等为题材。今日起在中山公园中山堂展览，本月十七日闭幕。希各界前往参观批评。
