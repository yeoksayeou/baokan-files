Fengfeng Coal Mine
How Does Fengfeng Coal Mine Implement the "Piece-Rate" System?
By Our Reporter Su Youmin

The work situation in the mine is very complex, with differences in pulling carts, pushing mine cars, the hardness of coal seams, the height of coal seams, the presence or absence of cement, the angle of slopes for pulling carts, and the size of roadways. Therefore, work efficiency also varies, making it difficult to find a uniform standard. Fengfeng Coal Mine has always used the day-wage system and contracting system, which capitalists could use to intensify exploitation. After the liberation of Fengfeng Coal Mine in September 1945, the mine became the property of the people. On the one hand, it was necessary to increase production and regularize mining; on the other hand, it was necessary to protect workers' welfare. The mine once switched to a system where workers rated themselves, but the results still had many shortcomings that could not be overcome. After in-depth investigation, careful conversion, and ideological education of the workers, a reasonable piece-rate wage system was finally implemented.

I. The Old Wage System's Long-Standing Problems

Before the war, the capitalists set the daily wage at five *jin* of millet. During the Japanese occupation, the daily wage was reduced to one and a half *jin* of coarse grains. The low wages meant that eight miners were equivalent to one employee. In order to have enough to eat and wear, workers had to "steal"—stealing coal, stealing iron, and stealing furniture. At the same time, they passively resisted through slow work, reduced production, and damage to furniture. Workers had no labor insurance and were subjected to long periods of oppression, which led to the emergence of "sworn brotherhoods" and "master-apprentice" relationships to seek help in life and care after death. Over time, this became a custom, developing into factionalism. Reflected in wages, this meant that some people could do light work or less work and receive high wages (relatively speaking), while honest workers or new workers who did more work received low wages. These long-standing problems left by the capitalists and imperialists did not meet the requirements of new production. After liberation, the mine began using a day-wage rating system while appropriately increasing wages. Because the standard difference was not large, there was a tendency towards egalitarianism, which limited the development of productive forces. Capable workers, after reaching a certain level, felt that they would get ten points anyway, so they rested. At the same time, because the leadership was not strong enough and the factional groups among the workers had not been dismantled, favoritism and unfairness appeared in the ratings. The more people there were, the more difficult it was to be accurate. As a result, honest people still suffered losses, which was not conducive to the principle of developing production.

II. Implementation Process

In order to calculate costs, improve production efficiency, and protect workers' actual labor income, the wage system had to be changed. The first difficulty encountered in the implementation process was what to use as a calculation standard: how to convert and unify coal mining, cart pulling, carpentry, etc., and to ensure that the actual wage amount corresponded to each person's actual daily production efficiency. Too high or too low would hinder production and workers' health. To this end, leaders at all levels, especially trade union cadres, conducted in-depth investigations and repeated studies to find a common unit of calculation from the complex conversion calculations, as well as the workers' existing labor intensity, improved standards, and living expenses standards. The biggest difficulty, however, lay in the workers' ideological resistance. When the idea of reasonably revising the wage system was first proposed, most workers said, "Such unfairness in the mine cannot be smoothed out even with an iron rake." The Japanese had also changed wages several times, but each time it only further harmed the workers. The lessons of history made them initially skeptical. As for those who relied on factionalism, they were naturally more firmly opposed. Only a few capable and willing workers who had been squeezed out in the past supported the change. Some individual cadres were also apprehensive about affecting production. Therefore, while starting the investigation and calculation, widespread education was carried out among the workers. However, after the formal implementation, because the workers' thinking had not been straightened out, coupled with the threats and agitation from factional leaders, some workers left their jobs and went home to harvest wheat for a time. After a month of implementation, production numbers increased significantly. With the same eight hours of labor, the wages earned were more than before, so the workers gradually returned to work.

III. Implementation Results

In the seven months from September last year to March this year: First, production efficiency was improved. The production standard set by the wage regulations was originally only achievable by 40% of the miners, but after one month, 70% achieved it. Now, except for the cart-pulling children, the vast majority have reached and exceeded the standard. Workers' actual wages have also increased accordingly. The highest wage for coal miners reached 20 *jin* of millet, the highest for carpenters reached 30 *jin* of millet, and including miscellaneous workers and cart-pulling child laborers, the total average wage for all miners was 10 *jin* of millet per person per day. The total production efficiency from January to May last year was an average output of 0.625 tons per worker, which gradually increased thereafter. From January to March this year, during the spring production competition, it reached 1.2 tons. The workers were adding more and more, thus increasing it to 1.4 tons. Second, standard specifications were implemented, entering regular mining, which laid the foundation for future production development. At the same time, with the clear calculation of furniture and wood used by the district teams, along with wage expenditures, it was possible to calculate costs daily and monthly, and to check the degree of enterprise production. Now, the mine has entered the stage of improving tools, improving mining methods, and preparing to train technicians to use pneumatic picks and electric drills, in order to continue to improve production efficiency while protecting the health of miners.

    峰峰煤矿
    怎样实行“按件记工”制？
   本报记者  苏幼民
    矿里的工作情况很复杂，有拉车、推罐、煤层的软硬、煤层高矮、有无水泥、拉车的坡道角度、大小行道等不同，因此工作效率也不同。很难求得统一标准。峰峰煤矿从来就采用日工制、包工制，资本家以此可以加紧剥削。一九四五年九月峰峰煤矿解放后，矿厂成了人民的财产，一方面要提高生产，正规开采，同时要保护工人福利，曾改用工人自己评分制，执行的结果仍有许多缺点不能克服，经过深入调查仔细折算，对工人进行思想教育，终于执行了合理的按件记工的工资制度。
    一、旧工资制的积弊
    战前资本家定的日工小米五斤，日寇在时日工杂粮斤半，八个矿工方抵一个职工的低工资，工人为了吃得饱，穿得上衣服，便不得不“偷”，偷煤偷铁偷家具，同时以怠工、减产、破坏家具等去消极对抗。工人没有劳动保险，常时间受压迫，因而就出现“拜把子”“结师徒”，以求生前有帮助死后有照顾，久之成为风习，就发展成为宗派，反映到工资上则一部分人干轻活，或少干活可领高工资（相对的说），而老实的工人或新工人多干了活却是低工资。这种资本家与帝国主义所给遗留下来的积弊，是不合新的生产要求的。该矿解放后开始曾在适当提高工资原则下，使用了日工评分制。因为标准差额不大，有平均主义偏向，限制了生产力的发挥，使能干的工人做到一定程度，认为反正怎样也是十分就休息了。同时因为领导不够有力，工人中的宗派团体还没有拆散，评分中便出现包庇不公道，人越多越不易准确，结果仍是老实的吃亏，不适合发展生产的原则。
    二、执行过程
    为了计算成本提高生产效率，并保护工人的实际劳动所得，工资制度必须改变。实行中，首先遇到的困难是以什么为计算标准，刨煤、拉车、木工等如何折合统一，确定工资实数与每人每日确实的生产效率应相称，过高或过低均会妨害生产与工人的健康。为此，各级领导干部，特别是职工会干部，均作了深入调查，与反复研究，从复杂的折合计算中，求出了共同计算单位，与工人的现有劳动强度，提高的标准，生活费用标准等。而最大的困难尚在工人的思想抵抗，开始提出合理改订工资制度进行酝酿时，多数工人说：“矿工里这种不公平现象，铁钯也钯不平。”日寇在时也曾几次改变过工资，但无论那一次都是更加残害工人。历史的教训使他们开始仍多抱怀疑态度，至于吃宗派饭的人自然更坚决反对，只有一部分能干肯干平素受排挤的工人是拥护的。某些个别干部，也唯恐影响生产而有所顾忌。于是在着手调查计算的同时，即在工人中普遍进行了酝酿教育，但正式执行后，因为工人思想尚未打通，再加宗派头的威胁鼓动，一时有一部分工人脱离了工作回家收麦。执行一个月后，生产数显著提高，同样是八个钟头的劳动，工资却比以前得的多了，因此工人就都陆续复工。
    三、执行效果
    从去年九月到今年三月的七个月内：首先是提高了生产效率，工资规定的产量标准，原只有百分之四十的矿工能达到的，但一个月以后即有百分之七十达到了，现在则除了拉车的小孩以外绝大部分都达到并超过了，工人实得工资也随之提高，煤工最高者达二十斤、木工最高达三十斤、连杂工拉车童工在内，所有矿工的工资总平均数为每人每日工资小米十斤。总生产效率去年一月至五月，工人的平均产量为○·六二五吨，以后逐日提高，今年一月至三月在春季大生产竞赛中，达一·二吨，工人们是添的满了再满，因此增到一·四吨了。第二执行了标准规格，进入正规开采，为将来发展生产打下了基础，同时在家具木头以区队为单位使用下连同工资开支数的清楚计算，能够逐日逐月随时计算成本，检查企业化生产程度，现已进入改良工具，改进开采方法，准备训练技术使用风镐电钻，以求在保护矿工健康的前提下继续提高生产效率。
