    "The Young Guard" is a work by Alexander Fadeyev, reflecting the true story of a group of Young Pioneers led by Oleg during the Soviet-German War, who fought bravely against the German invaders in the defense of their motherland and sacrificed heroically.

    Oleg and his comrades were mostly fifteen or sixteen-year-old children who grew up in the free, happy, and vibrant environment of the Soviet Union. While they were enjoying a warm and sweet life, suddenly, like a storm, the German fascist bandits, gathering their defeated and incomplete troops, and deploying massive mechanized forces, broke through the Stalingrad front and occupied Oleg's hometown, the Ukrainian coal mining city of Krasnodon, on June 20, 1942.

    From then on, "death" shrouded Krasnodon, and this lively and vibrant working-class city was instantly filled with sorrowful scenes.

    What a great shock this was to young Oleg and his comrades!

    When Oleg personally witnessed the atrocities he had never seen before, the shooting and burying alive of workers, captured Red Army soldiers, and officers by the bandits, and the heroic resistance of the martyrs, he quickly realized that the only way to deal with the enemy was to fight, and resolutely responded to the martyrs' call with action.

    From then on, Oleg and his comrades: Ivan Zemnukhov, Sergei Tyulenin, the girl Uliyana Gromova, Lyubov Shevtsova, and other young heroes, organized and seized every available moment and place, using all available conditions: shooting, explosions, arson, and starvation, etc. to threaten the enemy and hinder their war on the front lines.

    Regardless of how strict the bandits' surveillance was, in just a few months, the Young Pioneers had a mass anti-fascist organization of more than a hundred members, and each member wholeheartedly dedicated their pure and red heart to the motherland. They were all able to:

    "Give every German invader a bullet!"

    The bandits were terrified, as if they were on a high mountain, constantly preparing for their own death, but who could have imagined that these playful children around them would do such earth-shattering things?!

    Unexpectedly, when Oleg was carrying out the heroic and brilliant plan to blow up all the German officers in Krasnodon at the German officers' club, the secret was exposed due to a young and rash mistake made by one of the members…!

    "Can such a writer or painter be found in the world who can describe the entire truth of the inhuman suffering endured by the Young Pioneers in the secret police interrogation rooms?!" But Oleg and his comrades, no matter how much suffering they endured, had only one wish - to persevere unyieldingly until death for the victory of the motherland.

    Because they were children who grew up under the nurture of the Soviet motherland and Stalin, with a high degree of class political consciousness.

    Because they knew that what they were doing was the cause of Lenin and Stalin, the cause of the Soviet people, and the cause of peace-loving people all over the world, and this cause was a very glorious and great cause.

    Because they had a strong belief in victory and an unbreakable spirit of Bolshevik loyalty.

    These immortal youths represent the entire Soviet people and are an epitome of the Soviet people. Through this small collection, we can fully see how the Soviet people completely wiped out the most ferocious enemy in the world, an enemy that surpassed them in strength. Is there any enemy in the world more ferocious than the German invaders of that time?

    The Soviet people, tempered by this war, have become more courageous and stronger, and the forces of peace-loving people all over the world, united with the Soviet Union at their head, are even more incomparably powerful.

    The American reactionaries' attempt to provoke another world war against the Soviet Union to undermine world peace is tantamount to seeking their own early demise, and even more ridiculous is the Chinese reactionaries' attempt to deceive the people with fake peace to prolong their lives, waiting for a world war to break out to take the opportunity to rise up and massacre the people. They are blind people who do not see the facts, and this trick will forever turn to ashes.

    When this book "The Young Guard" appeared in Northeast China, it quickly integrated with the youth of Northeast China, inspiring the vast number of young people and becoming a must-read for them.

    It is indeed a youth reading material worth recommending.

    奥列格·高射沃依和他的同伴们
    李力
    “不朽的青年”一书，是温列格尔的著作，内容是反映苏德战争期间以奥列格为首的一些少年先锋队员们，在保卫祖国战争中，同德寇作残酷斗争而英勇牺牲的真实历史。
    奥列格和他的同伴们，大都是十五六岁的孩子们，是在苏联这个自由、幸福、生气勃勃的环境中生长起来的一群。当他们正过着温暖而甜蜜的生活时，突然间，象一阵暴风雨似的德法西斯蒂匪徒们，把吃过严重败仗的残缺不全的队伍，集中起来大量机械兵力突破了斯大林格勒方面的阵线，就在一九四二年六月二十日占领了拥有三万五千居民的奥列格家乡、乌克兰、煤矿工人城市克拉斯诺顿。
    从此“死神”笼罩着克拉斯诺顿，这活跃生气勃勃的工人城市，顿时布满了悲愁景象。
    这在年轻的奥列格和他的同伴们，是多么大的刺激呀！
    当奥列格亲眼看到从来没有看见过的，工人们和被掳的红军战士们及军官们被匪徒们枪杀活埋的兽行，而烈士们那种英勇反抗的行为时，他很快意识到对敌人只有斗争，坚决以行动响应烈士们的号召。
    从此奥列格和他的同伴们：依万·齐木努和夫，谢尔杰·邱里宁，少女乌里杨娜·格罗莫瓦，刘巴·射操瓦等少年英雄们，有组织的，不放松任何可利用的时间和地点，利用一切可利用的条件：枪杀、爆炸、火烧、饿困等威胁敌人，牵切敌人在前线的战争。
    不管匪徒们怎样的严格的监视，只几个月的工夫少先队已有百余队员的群众性的反法西斯蒂的组织了，而且每个队员们，都是把自己的那颗鲜红的纯洁的心，诚心诚意献给祖国，他们都能作到：
    “应当每一个德寇给他们一粒子弹”的号召。
    匪徒们恐布了，好象登在大山上一样，时刻准备着自己的死亡，但谁能想到，在他们周围这些玩皮的孩子们，会干出这样惊天动地的事情来呢？！
    不料，有一次奥列格执行把克拉斯诺顿所有德寇军官们炸死在德国军官领堂的英勇灿烂的计谋时，因被一个队员犯了幼稚而轻率的罪，暴露了秘密………！
    “难道世界上能找到这样的文学家和画家，能够把少年先锋队员们在秘密警察拷问室中所受之非人痛苦的全部真象描写出来吗”？！但奥列格和他的同伴们，无论遭到如何痛苦，他们只有一个愿望——坚忍不屈，一直到为祖国的胜利而死。
    因为他们是在苏联祖国和斯大林培养下生长起来的，有高度的阶级政治觉悟的孩子们。
    因为他们知道自己所作的是列宁、斯大林的事业，是苏维埃人民的事业，是全世界爱好和平人民的事业，这事业是非常光荣而伟大的事业。
    因为他们有对于胜利的坚强信念，对布尔什维克坚固的钢铁般的忠诚的精神。
    这些不朽的青年们是代表着苏联全体人民，是苏联人民的缩影。我们透过这小集子，完全可以看出苏联人民是怎样把世界上最凶恶的而且胜过自己的敌人消灭得一干二净，难道世界上还有比当年德寇更凶猛的敌人吗？
    苏联人民经过这次战争洗礼，锻练得更勇敢、更坚强，而且以苏联为首团结世界上一切爱好和平的力量，是更无比强大的。
    美国反动派们企图反苏挑起再一次的世界大战以破坏世界和平，那是自取早日灭亡，而更可笑的是中国反动派们企图以假和平来欺骗人民苟延残喘等待世界战争爆发，趁机而起来屠杀人民，那是不看事实的睁眼瞎，这诡计将永远化为灰烬。
    这本“不朽的青年”一书出现在东北时，很快与东北青年相结合，鼓舞了广大青年，成为广大青年们必读之物。
    的确是值得介绍的一本青年读物。
