　　North China Post Office to Launch Collect-on-Delivery Service Next Month
    Postal Service to Commence Immediately Upon Liberation of Southern Cities
    [Ping City News] The North China Postal and Telecommunications Bureau recently issued an order to all post offices in the region to begin a new collect-on-delivery service on June 1st. For newspapers, publications, cultural publishing houses, factories, businesses, and government organizations that require a return receipt for their sent newspapers, books, advertisements, letters, etc., they can enclose a specially made blank envelope, stationery, or postcard, and a return receipt (with a post office-designated template, or self-made by the sending organization) in the mailed item. This allows the recipient (or receiving organization) to reply with a return letter or return the receipt after receiving the mail, answering questions or indicating receipt. This method eliminates the difficulty for sending organizations in not knowing whether the mail was received and addresses the phenomenon of not receiving replies to questions. There is no charge for sending the reply letter or returning the receipt. Upon return, the original sending organization, factory, or business will pay the prescribed unified fee, settled monthly. Those wishing to use this service must first fill out an application form, register with the local postal administration, obtain a permit, and prepay a deposit. Specific procedures can be discussed with the local postal administration.
    Furthermore, postal service for ordinary letters, registered mail, newspapers, and printed matter has commenced in the newly liberated southern cities and towns of Jiaxing, Anqing, Wuxing, Changxing, Langxi, Dexing, Jingdezhen, Jiangshan, Longyou, Lanxi, Jinhua, Yiwu, Dongyang, Yongkang, Wuyi, Jinyun, Lishui, Xuanping, Songyang, Suichang, Jiashan, Chongan, and Linchuan. A notice has also been issued to all post offices in North China to proactively accept the above-mentioned mail items (excluding parcels and remittances) to and from cities and towns in the Jiangnan region as soon as they are liberated.

　　华北邮局下月举办收取回件邮费业务
    江南城市一解放马上通邮
    【平市讯】华北邮电总局顷通令全区各邮局于六月一日开始办理收取回件邮费新业务。该项业务无论书报文化出版机关、工厂、商行以及各政府团体等，对其所发之报纸书志、广告、信函等欲要回执者，可在所发之邮件内附装特制之空白信封、信纸或信片、回执（邮局设定样式，寄件机关自制），让收件人（或收件机关）收到邮件后答复回信或退回回执，答复问题或表示收到。此种办法，可免除寄件机关发出邮件后不知收到与否的困难和有问题不答复等现象。在答复回信或退回执时，免费交寄，待退回时，由原寄件机关、工厂、商行等按规定统一付费，每月清结一次。欲用此办法者，须首先填具声请书，向本地区之邮政管理局进行登记，领发许可证，预交保证金，其具体办法，可与本地区之邮政管理局洽商。
    又，江南新解放之嘉兴、安庆、吴兴、长兴、郎溪、德兴、景德镇、江山、龙游、兰溪、金华、义乌、东阳、永康、武义、缙云、丽水、宣平、松阳、遂昌、嘉善、崇安、临川等城镇开始通平信、挂号、新闻纸、印刷品等邮件。并已通令华北各邮局，今后江南各城镇一经解放，即主动收寄上列邮件（包裹汇兑除外）。（笑川）
