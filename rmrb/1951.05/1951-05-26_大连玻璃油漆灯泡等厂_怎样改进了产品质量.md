How Dalian Glass, Paint, Light Bulb and Other Factories Improved Product Quality
    Zhou Xin, Zhou Shizhi

    The Dalian glass, paint, and light bulb factories, formerly managed by the Sino-Soviet joint venture Far East Electric Power Company, have improved product quality and reduced costs year by year. The paint factory's defect rate was 50% in 1948, but dropped to 0.5% in 1950. Using 1948 as a base, costs decreased to 71% by 1950. The light bulb factory's defect rate was 16.7% in 1948, but dropped to 3.5% in 1950. In the glass factory, first-class products exceeded the plan by 25.9% in 1949 and by 38% in 1950. Costs also gradually decreased.

    They mainly did the following to improve quality:

    I. Establish product quality specifications. The quality specifications must consider the factory's equipment, technical conditions, finished products, and market needs, but also pay attention to continuous improvement and enhancement of quality. After the quality specifications are established, every worker, technician, and staff member must know what constitutes a good product and what constitutes a defective product.

    II. Strengthen technical education and improve workers' technical skills. Many rejects and rework are caused by workers' low technical skills. To improve quality, workers' technical skills must first be improved. The Dalian Far East Electric Power Company attached great importance to strengthening workers' technical education. In 1949, a technical school was established, which trained 1,022 technical workers by October of last year. Each workshop also has a technical team, focusing on solving the difficulties and technical problems encountered by workers in actual operation. Apprenticeships are also a good way to improve workers' technical skills.

    III. Do a good job in technical inspection. Implementing strict technical inspection is the key to ensuring product quality; but first, there must be a sound inspection organization and appropriately equipped inspection cadres. The glass factory's inspection department is an independent organization that reports directly to the factory director, and the cadre allocation is also relatively strong. The analysis room is also a separate organization that reports directly to the engineer. The paint factory has held several small technical training classes to train many inspection cadres.

    IV. Conduct inspections of finished and semi-finished products during the production process. This is very important. On the one hand, it can promptly detect and try to improve unqualified semi-finished products to avoid producing rejects and wasting raw materials and labor; on the other hand, it can also urge workers to abide by technical operating procedures. The paint factory stipulates that product samples must be taken on site every two hours, and production is stopped immediately if they are unqualified, and the reasons are studied. Every night, the qualified samples are put together for investigation and research, and the results are recorded. The light bulb factory checks each production process through a "Defective Product Registration Form". Each shift's defective product inspector performs an inspection every hour and writes the problems on the registration form. The cadres of the light bulb department find out the causes of defective products from the number of defective products on the registration form and correct them in time. Workers can also understand the causes of problems and pay attention to avoiding defective products.

    V. Implement inspection of raw materials and finished products entering the warehouse. This is also a necessary link in technical inspection. If the quality specifications of raw materials are not met, it will be difficult to make excellent products no matter how meticulous the processing is. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate quality specifications and systems for raw materials. The raw materials purchased by the paint factory are first analyzed and tested by the laboratory according to the specifications. Whether the material is qualified and how the finished product quality is must be noted on the receipt. If the quality specifications of raw materials are too far from the prescribed standards, it must be approved by the higher authorities before production. When the finished products of the paint factory are put into the warehouse, they must also be analyzed and tested to avoid finding that the quality is not good after the finished products are put into the warehouse and not being able to find out who is responsible.

    VI. Implement a strict system of specific responsibility. Each inspector in the glass factory has a fixed number. After the glass is packed, the inspector's number is written on the box cover. If problems occur in the future, the factory can immediately find out who is responsible based on the number and time on the box. Before the paint factory implemented the specific responsibility system, it produced 800 tons of oil paste that did not meet the quality specifications; since the implementation of the responsibility system, so many defective products have never been produced again.

    VII. Conduct regular publicity and education. To improve product quality, workers should also be regularly educated on the importance of quality. The Chinese Communist Party branch, the trade union grass-roots committee, and the Communist Youth League branch should grasp the number of defective products, study the causes, suggest that the administrative department solve them in time, and promote good experiences. When the paint trade union found that there were many defective products, it held a meeting and invited administrative cadres and workers who produced defective products to study together. The light bulb factory's trade union used propaganda and mobilization methods to educate workers on the importance of product quality. For example, the machine with fewer defective products is given a winning flag, and production results and defective product numbers are announced on the blackboard newspaper and quick report every day, so that workers know their achievements and shortcomings of the day after work, so that they can pay attention to correcting them in time.

　　大连玻璃油漆灯泡等厂
    怎样改进了产品质量
    周欣、周士志
    原属中苏合营的远东电业公司所管的大连玻璃、油漆、灯泡三个工厂，产品质量逐年提高，成本逐年降低。油漆厂一九四八年不良品占百分之五十，一九五○年降到百分之零点五。成本以一九四八年作基数，到一九五○年降到百分之七十一。灯泡厂一九四八年不良品占百分之十六点七，一九五○年降到百分之三点五。玻璃厂一九四九年一级品超过计划百分之二十五点九，一九五○年超过计划百分之三十八，成本也都逐渐降低。
    他们在提高质量上，主要做了下面几件工作：
    一、制订产品质量规格。规定质量规格，不仅要考虑到工厂设备、技术条件、成品和市场的需要，还要注意质量的不断改进和提高。质量规格制定后，还要使每个工人、技术人员和职员都知道什么是良品和不良品。
    二、加强技术教育，提高工人技术水平。许多废品和返手活的产生，是由于工人技术的低劣。要提高质量，首先要提高工人技术水平。大连远东电业公司对加强工人技术教育很重视。一九四九年建立了技术学校，到去年十月培养了一千零二十二名技术工人。各车间里还设有技术小组，着重解决工人在实际操作中所碰到的困难和技术问题。师傅带徒弟，也是提高工人技术水平的一种好办法。
    三、做好技术检查工作。实行严格的技术检查是保证产品质量的关键；但首先要有健全的检查机构和配备适当的检查干部。玻璃厂的检查科是一个独立的组织，直接对厂长负责，干部配备也较强。分析室也是单独组织，直接对工程师负责。油漆厂曾举办了几次小型的技术训练班，培养了不少检查干部。
    四、在生产过程中进行成品和半成品的检查。这样做非常重要，一方面可以及时发现并设法改进不够规格的半成品，免得出废品，浪费原材料和劳动力；另一方面也可以督促工人遵守技术操作规程。油漆厂规定每隔两小时到现场取一次产品试料，不合格立刻停止生产，研究原因。每晚，再把合格的试料合在一起，进行一次调查研究，并记录成绩。灯泡厂是通过“废品登记表”来检查每一个生产过程。每班的废品检查员每小时进行一次检查，把毛病写在登记表上。灯泡科的干部就从登记表的废品数目字中，找出废品产生的原因，及时纠正。工人也就可以了解出毛病的原因，注意不出废品。
    五、实行原材料与成品入库的检查。这也是技术检查工作中的必要的环节。原材料质量规格不够，任凭加工如何细致，也难以做出优良产品。因此，制定原材料的质量规格和制度是很必要的。油漆厂买来的原料，首先由化验室按规格分析化验，这种材料是否合格，做出的成品质量如何，都要在收条上注明。如果原材料的质量规格与规定标准相差太远，必须经上级批准才能生产。油漆厂成品入库时，还要经过分析化验，免得成品入库后发现质量不好而又找不出由谁负责。
    六、实行严格的专责制度。玻璃厂每个检查员都有固定的号数，玻璃装箱后，在箱子盖上写着检查员的号数。以后发生问题时，厂方根据箱上的号数、时间，马上可以找出应负责任的人。油漆厂在没实行专责制以前，曾出过八百吨不合质量规格的油膏子；自从实行了责任制以后，就再没有出过这么多的废品。
    七、经常进行宣传教育。要提高产品质量，还应该经常对工人进行重视质量的思想教育。中国共产党支部、工会基层委员会、青年团支部要掌握废品数字，研究原因，建议行政方面及时解决，并推广好的经验。油漆工会发现废品多，便召开会议，请行政干部和出废品的工人一起研究。灯泡厂工会利用宣传鼓动方式，教育工人重视产品质量。比如那个机器废品少，就给插上优胜旗，每天在黑板报、快报上公布生产成绩和废品数字，使工人下班就知道自己当天的成绩与缺点，以便及时注意纠正。
