　　After the Implementation of Labor Insurance in Tianjin's Cotton Mills
    Workers' Living Difficulties Decreased and Enthusiasm for Labor Increased
    Trade Union Education Work Was Insufficient, and a Few Workers Feigned Illness to Take Leave
    Thirty-six units of state-owned, locally-managed, and private cotton mills in Tianjin, with 32,969 employees, have enjoyed the benefits of the Labor Insurance Regulations. To smoothly carry out labor insurance work, factories have successively trained and cultivated trade union cadres above the group leader level. After the initial implementation of labor insurance, factories have successively added medical clinics, hospitals, and contracted hospitals. The Tianjin Textile Workers' Union has also opened a textile workers' sanatorium for light cases.
    The implementation of labor insurance has solved and alleviated the difficulties of birth, old age, sickness, death, disability, and injury that workers have suffered the most from over the years. In the past, under Kuomintang rule, workers would be fired if they didn't work. A weaving worker in the Sixth Factory had three children die in her womb before birth. A fine spinning worker in the Fourth Factory once gave birth to a child in the workshop. Now, this problem has been fundamentally solved. In the first quarter alone, the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factories One, Two, Three, and Four had 347 female workers enjoying maternity leave, with the administration paying wages as usual, ensuring the safety and health of mothers and children. In the past, workers were most afraid of being fired when they got old. However, since the implementation of labor insurance, 30 elderly workers in the cotton textile factories have been approved for retirement and receive monthly pensions, and the trade union has also held celebrations for them. Since the implementation of labor insurance last year, the disease and mortality rates of employees have been greatly reduced. The number of employee deaths in the cotton textile factories was 152 the year before last, but only 63 last year. The implementation of labor insurance has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of employees. Sun Zhanying, a worker in the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory Three, suffered from meningitis. He was hospitalized and cured in accordance with the Labor Insurance Regulations. After being discharged from the hospital, he was very active in production, won a red flag, and was also named a model worker.
    However, due to the insufficient and non-thorough publicity and education work by trade unions and relevant parties, there are still many shortcomings in the work. The relatively serious problem is that the absenteeism rate in various factories is very high, which affects production. The absenteeism rate is often between 7% and 12%. For example, the absenteeism rate in the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory Six in March was 10.38%, and the absenteeism rate in the private Beiyang Yarn Factory in February reached more than 14%. The main reason for absenteeism is sick leave. Some of the workers' illnesses can be avoided. For example, after state-owned factories switched to three shifts, some workers did not rest or eat on time, female workers did not pay attention to hygiene, or the intensity of labor increased, as well as serious overtime work, etc. The most serious situation is that due to insufficient publicity and education, some workers lack a correct understanding of labor insurance and have the idea that "they get paid even if they don't work," resulting in feigning illness to take leave. For example, Dou Zhangshi, a female worker in the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory Five, pretended to be sick and took several months off work, and also told others: "Don't look at me taking time off, I only get a few days less pay a month." A male worker in the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory Five once said to his wife: "It's terribly hot, let's take two days off, anyway, we get paid even if we don't work." Similar situations have occurred in other factories. Recently, when the trade union of the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory One visited patients, it was found that out of 47 patients, 9 were seriously ill, 21 were mildly ill, and 15 were on sick leave and not at home. After the visit, two immediately went to work. There were also individual workers who went to see movies and play football after taking sick leave. This situation has aroused the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of employees. The Labor Insurance Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union has put forward opinions for the reference of various factories. The department believes that to solve this problem, first of all, it is necessary to carry out universal and in-depth ideological education among employees so that employees can have a correct understanding of labor insurance. Secondly, workers should be mobilized to discuss and formulate specific measures to reduce absenteeism in groups. At the same time, trade unions should criticize and educate those who are lazy and feign illness, the administration should formulate a scientific leave system, and solve some problems related to the health of employees that can be solved, etc.

### 天津各棉纺织厂实行劳动保险后  工人生活困难减少劳动热情提高  工会教育工作不够少数工人装病请假

　　天津各棉纺织厂实行劳动保险后
    工人生活困难减少劳动热情提高
    工会教育工作不够少数工人装病请假
    天津国营、地方经营与私营各棉纺织厂已有三十六个单位三万二千九百六十九个职工享受了劳动保险条例待遇。为了顺利地进行劳动保险工作，各厂曾先后训练和培养了小组长以上的工会干部。开始实行劳动保险后，各厂先后都增添了医务室医院及特约医院，天津市纺织工会还开办了一个纺织工人疗养院，做为轻病号疗养之用。
    劳动保险的实行，解决了和减轻了工人群众历年来最感痛苦的生、老、病、死、残、伤的困难。过去国民党统治时，不干活就开除。六厂一个织布女工，过去三个孩子都是未生下就死在肚子里。四厂一个细纱女工，曾把孩子生在车间里，现在，这个问题已经得到根本上的解决。只国营天津棉纺织一、二、三、四厂第一季就有三百四十七个女工享受了产假的待遇，行政照发了工资，保证了母亲和孩子的安全和健康。过去，工人们最怕年老了就要被开除。可是，自实行劳动保险后，棉纺织各厂已有三十个老年工人被批准退休，按月领取养老金，工会还为他们开了庆祝会。从去年实行劳动保险后，大大地减少了职工的疾病死亡率，棉纺织各厂职工的死亡人数，前年是一百五十二人，去年只有六十三人。劳动保险的实行，使职工的生产热情得到很大的鼓舞。国营天津棉纺织三厂工友孙占英患了脑膜炎，按照劳动保险条例住医院治好了，出院后生产非常积极，得了红旗，又被评为模范。
    但是，由于工会和有关方面宣传教育工作不够普遍深入，工作中还有不少缺点。比较严重的是各厂缺勤率很高，影响生产。缺勤率经常在百分之七到百分之十二之间，如国营天津棉纺织六厂三月份缺勤率为百分之十点三八，私营北洋纱厂二月份缺勤率竟达百分之十四以上。缺勤的主要原因是病假。工友们的疾病，有些是可以避免的。比如国营工厂改三班后有些工友不按时作息、饮食，女工不注意卫生，或劳动强度增加，以及严重的加班加点现象等。而最严重的情况是：由于宣传教育不够，部分工人对劳动保险缺少正确的认识，存在着“歇工也给钱”的思想，因而发生装病请假现象。如国营天津棉纺织五厂女工窦张氏假装病了歇了几个月的工，还向别人说：“别看我歇工，一月不过少发两天钱。”国营天津棉纺织五厂一男工曾对他老婆说：“天怪热的，歇两天吧，反正歇工也给钱。”其他工厂也有类似情况。最近国营天津棉纺织一厂工会慰问病人时发现，四十七名病人中重病的九人，较轻的二十一人，请病假而不在家的十五人，经过访问立即上班的两人。还有个别工友请了病假以后去看电影、踢球。这种情况已经引起广大职工群众的不满。纺织工会天津市委员会劳动保险部对此已提出意见供各厂参考。该部认为要解决这个问题，首先须在职工中进行普遍深入的思想教育，使职工群众对劳动保险能有正确的认识。其次，应发动工人，在小组中讨论并订出降低缺勤率的具体办法。同时工会对偷懒装病者应进行批评教育，行政上应订出科学的请假制度，并解决一些可能解决的有关职工健康的问题等。
