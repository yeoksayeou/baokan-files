　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th: According to TASS, Soviet newspapers on the 5th published an article by Soviet Finance Minister Zverev, discussing the new government bonds issued this year, stating: The funds obtained from the issuance of new government bonds will be used for great communist construction projects to further improve the people's welfare. While the economies and cultures of capitalist countries are further declining, the growth of the Soviet national economy is even more prominent. For example, in the United States, food prices alone rose by more than 24 percent in the past year; in the United Kingdom, the general price index has almost doubled since the Labour Party came to power. In preparation for war, capitalist countries are putting their economies on a war footing. However, in the Soviet Union, nearly two-thirds of the budgetary expenditures this year are allocated to the development of the economy and culture.
　　Zverev continued: The Soviet Union's budget revenue is mainly derived from the income of socialist industry, agriculture, and trade, and the issuance of government bonds is one of the sources of budget revenue. Before the war, the Soviet Union issued about 50 billion rubles of government bonds, which played a significant role in developing the economy and consolidating national defense. During the Great Patriotic War, the issuance of more than 76 billion rubles of government bonds strengthened the Soviet army. After the war, the income from the issuance of government bonds totaled 130 billion rubles, which was used to complete the main tasks of the post-war Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people welcome national government bonds, and about 70 million people hold government bonds. The laboring people who subscribe to government bonds can also receive extra income in the form of government bond prizes. After the war, the Soviet Union has paid out 17 billion rubles in government bond prizes, and this year another 5 billion rubles will be paid out. The issuance of new government bonds is fully in line with the interests of the laboring people and plays a significant role in the Soviet Union's advance towards communism.

    苏财长论发行新公债
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：五日苏联各报刊载苏联财政部长兹维列夫的论文，论述今年发行的新公债称：发行新公债所得的款项将用来进行伟大的共产主义建设工程，进一步改善人民福利。当资本主义国家的经济与文化更为衰落的时候，苏联国民经济的增长更显得突出。比如在美国，仅在去年一年内食物价格就上涨了百分之二十四以上；在英国，自从工党执政以来物价总指数几乎上升了一倍。为了准备战争，资本主义国家正把经济转上战时轨道。但是在苏联，今年预算支出中近三分之二的拨款都用于发展经济、文化。
    兹维列夫继称：苏联预算收入以社会主义工农业和贸易的收入为主，发行公债是预算收入来源之一。战前苏联发行了约五百亿卢布的公债，对于发展经济、巩固国防起了很大作用。卫国战争时期发行的七百六十余亿卢布公债，曾经加强了苏军的力量。战后发行公债的收入共为一千三百亿卢布，用来完成战后五年计划的主要任务。苏联人民欢迎国家公债，约有七千万人持有公债。劳动人民认购公债并可以得到额外收入的公债奖金，战后苏联已付出一百七十亿卢布的公债奖金，今年将再付出五十亿卢布奖金。发行新公债完全符合劳动人民的利益，对于苏联向共产主义迈进起着很大的作用。
