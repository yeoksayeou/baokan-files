　　Various Localities Fully Utilize Broadcast Rallies for Propaganda
    Five Million People in East China and Two and a Half Million People in Northeast China Signed the Peace Council Declaration After Listening to the Broadcast
    The East China and Shanghai People's Organizations and the East China People's Broadcasting Station held the "East China People's Celebration of the 'May 1st' Labor Day Broadcast Rally" for three evenings on April 25th, 26th, and 27th. All fifteen People's Broadcasting Stations and twenty-two private radio stations in East China rebroadcast simultaneously. According to incomplete statistics, more than six million listeners in East China's cities and rural areas were organized to listen to the live broadcast of the rally over the three days. Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the East China Anti-American Aid Korea General Sub-Committee Preparatory Committee, served as chairman of the rally. On the first day of the rally, Ma Yinchu delivered the opening speech, and Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke. In his speech, Chairman Rao praised the great achievements of the working people of East China in various fields over the past year, and called on people from all walks of life in East China and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in East China to support the resolution of the World Peace Council, popularize and deepen the anti-American aid Korea movement, and assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In his speech, Chen Yi called on the people of East China to examine their contributions to the anti-American aid Korea movement and their patriotic pacts. Lu Cui, the Chinese representative who attended the World Peace Council, called on the people of East China to sign the World Peace Council Declaration and vote against the United States' arming of Japan at the rally. After Lu Cui's speech, the chairman of the rally, Ma Yinchu, and the hero models who attended the rally signed and voted on the spot. Many listeners immediately called the rally to report the number and situation of signatures and votes. Liu Changsheng, Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, called on the workers at the meeting to celebrate this year's "May 1st" festival by assisting the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and launching patriotic labor competitions.
    Several combat heroes and labor models also spoke at the meeting. At the meeting, Chen Suying, a resident of Nanjing who was severely beaten by the Japanese invaders, accused the Japanese invaders of slaughtering 300,000 people in Nanjing. Feng Renxiang, a worker at the Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory, and others accused the special agents of crimes. Zhang Wenfu, a resident of Nanjing, and Shen Guoyin, a resident of Shanghai, reported the process of their catching special agents. In addition, the rally broadcast a recording of Gao Chao, a representative of the returning volunteers, and many wonderful literary and artistic programs.
    The masses in various places organized themselves to listen to the live broadcast of the rally, and their emotions were very enthusiastic. Residents on the north bank of the Yellow River braved heavy rain every night to cross the river to Jinan to listen to the broadcast of the rally. In the three days, the rally received more than 4,000 direct calls from listeners. More than 4,000 representatives from more than 400 units in Shanghai presented flowers, flags, and speeches to the rally. Some units sent representatives to the rally to read out their anti-American aid Korea resolutions and labor competition challenges or responses.
    According to preliminary statistics, about five million listeners signed the World Peace Council Declaration while listening to the live broadcast of the rally; many listeners donated money or wrote letters on the spot to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's Forces; the Industry and Commerce Federation of Haining, Zhejiang, donated more than 46 million yuan in ten minutes. Twelve medical workers from the Nanjing Medical Office of the East China Revolutionary University immediately signed up to participate in the volunteer medical team to Korea. Listeners in Nanjing wrote letters to the Nanjing People's Broadcasting Station, reporting twenty-two counter-revolutionaries. The P4-1351 locomotive of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, which had safely traveled 170,000 kilometers, made a guarantee that it would operate 200,000 kilometers without accidents. The migrant workers repairing the Yellow River in Luokou promised not to go home until the Yellow River was repaired.

    The Northeast Anti-American Aid Korea General Sub-Committee held a broadcast rally on April 27 to popularize and deepen the anti-American aid Korea movement and oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan. The Northeast People's Broadcasting Station and its fourteen branch stations jointly broadcast the live broadcast of the rally. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2.5 million people in the region listened and participated in the signing of the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace convention and the vote against the United States' arming of Japan.
    Liu Zhiming, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Anti-American Aid Korea General Sub-Committee, delivered the opening speech at the rally. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, called on the people of the region to sign the World Peace Council Declaration, continue to popularize and deepen the anti-American aid Korea movement, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and work hard in various positions to practice their patriotic pacts with concrete actions.
    Then the rally proceeded to accuse the crimes of the U.S., Japanese, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. During the fourteen years of being occupied, the people of Northeast China suffered the slaughter of millions of people by the Japanese invaders, countless women were raped, and a large amount of property was plundered. After Japan surrendered, most of the region was brutally ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs raised by the U.S. imperialism. Since liberation, people's lives have been flourishing in the two years of economic construction, but since June of last year, they have been threatened by the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and the people of some towns and villages have been brutally bombed by U.S. planes many times. All the people who suffered from the imperialists and their lackey Chiang Kai-shek bandits made just accusations with tears at the broadcast rally today. Mo Desheng, a worker at the Fushun Steel Plant, accused the Japanese invaders of slaughtering more than 2,000 of our compatriots in the Pingdingshan massacre in Fushun; farmer Chu Guoquan accused the Japanese invaders of stabbing him twelve times; Zhang Zichen, a teacher at Andar County Elementary School, accused the Japanese invaders of establishing a germ factory in the county to slaughter our compatriots; Jin Bowen, the wife of General Li Zhaolin, accused the Kuomintang secret agents of assassinating General Li Zhaolin; the Liaodong All Circles Accusation Group accused the U.S. planes of slaughtering our peaceful people in the sky-high crime....
    These accusations, word by word and tear by tear, aroused the listeners' incomparable hatred. In the central venue and various listening venues, there was a wave of impassioned slogans. Within five hours, the rally received calls and telegrams from more than 400 units. These calls and telegrams expressed deep condolences to the suffering compatriots and expressed their patriotic determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Fourty-thousand listeners in Changchun, listening at more than 200 locations, telegraphed the rally saying, "The bloody accusations of our compatriots have aroused our immense anger. We firmly oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan! We firmly resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea! Avenge the compatriots who were harmed!" The Kang Xuefu team of the Qiqihar Railway Factory immediately expressed their patriotic determination to the rally with three conditions, including guaranteeing to exceed the production target by 20% every month. Some units also donated money to express their condolences to the victims of the U.S. bombing in Andong. When the rally announced that a group of counter-revolutionary criminals had been arrested in Shenyang, the slogan "Support the People's Government's Resolute Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" immediately broke out in the venue.
    After the accusations, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army spoke successively, expressing their determination and confidence to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defend the motherland, and defend the interests of the people. The elementary school students in Shenyang also presented flowers to the representatives of the People's Volunteers with warm applause to pay their respects.

    东北抗美援朝总分会于四月二十七日举行普及深入抗美援朝、反对美国重新武装日本广播大会，由东北人民广播电台和所属十四个分台联合播送大会实况。据初步统计：全区有二百五十余万人收听，并参加了拥护缔结和平公约宣言的签名，和反对美国武装日本的投票。

    控诉以后，中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的代表相继讲话，表示了他们抗美援朝和保卫祖国、保卫人民利益的决心和信心。沈阳市的小学生们，并在热烈的掌声中向人民志愿军的代表献花致敬。
