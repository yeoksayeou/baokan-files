A telegram of salute to Chairman Mao from all the representatives attending the meeting for handling institutions accepting American-subsidized relief, the text of which is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise leadership, the Chinese people have been liberated, have obtained land, and have achieved preliminary economic prosperity; decades of unprecedented disasters have been overcome. The hundreds of thousands of troops harnessing the Huai River are working enthusiastically. The people's political status has been raised to an unprecedented level. This is the victorious fruit of the Communist Party, led by you, and the heroic and hardworking people of the whole country, consistently sacrificing themselves for decades. In order to consolidate our victorious fruit, we must not allow American imperialism to use "relief" organizations to carry out its aggression plot in China again. We attended the meeting for handling institutions accepting American-subsidized relief, listened to the enlightening reports from the leaders, and also heard the accusations from comrades against the bloody crimes of the American imperialist elements; this has further raised our awareness. We assure you: All Chinese personnel in institutions accepting American-subsidized relief will unite and study under the correct leadership of the People's Government, resolutely reject the so-called "aid" of American imperialism, sever any connection with American imperialism; and rely on the people's own strength to run the relief and welfare undertakings of the Chinese people themselves well. We will use our practical actions of wholeheartedly serving the suffering elderly, young, men and women to express our gratitude to you. We offer our most respectful salute.
