　　Hebei Overfulfills Cotton Planting Task; Continuing to Carry Out Seedling Inspection and Replanting Campaign

    Hebei Province has overfulfilled its cotton planting task and is now continuing to carry out a seedling inspection and replanting campaign. Under the impetus of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, the province's drought-resistant cotton planting work has exceeded the original plan by more than 2,490,000 mu. All ten special districts, except for a few counties, have overfulfilled the task. Handan Special District exceeded the task by more than 324,300 mu; Xingtai Special District exceeded the task by more than 520,000 mu; Tianjin Special District, which has no cotton planting tradition, also exceeded the task by 66 percent.

    This spring, despite the drought and dry land, the province's cotton planting plan has been overfulfilled. This is mainly due to: (1) strengthening the leadership of drought-resistant cotton planting. Provincial People's Government Chairman Yang Xiufeng visited Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Dingxian and other special districts in April to inspect cotton planting and provide specific guidance. Around the "May 1st" Labor Day, in order to break the idea of relying on the weather and waiting for rain among district and village cadres and some of the masses, the ten special districts and seventy counties organized 6,539 cadres to go to the countryside to lead cotton planting work. (2) The development of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement has greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers to plant cotton. In many areas, farmers launched competitions to plant "Resist America Cotton" and "Patriotic Cotton." After denouncing the various crimes of burning, killing and looting by Japanese imperialism, 29 villages including Beibaizhuang in Shenze County, raised their patriotic enthusiasm and organized labor mutual aid to carry water and plant more than 36,900 mu of cotton. After signing patriotic covenants and supporting peace covenants in various counties of Xingtai Special District, many farmers put forward the slogan: "One name, one gun, plant cotton with one heart, defeat the American wolf." Under the impetus of this slogan, Dazhang Village in Shahe exceeded the original cotton planting plan by 116 percent. (3) Adhering to the principle of "organization first," the productive forces in rural areas have been further developed. All localities universally implemented labor and animal power exchange and mutual assistance, and widely mobilized women, children, and elderly men to participate in labor. Many areas have achieved "men, women, and children all working together; people, animals, and tools are all fully utilized." According to statistics from 2,663 villages in nine counties including Ninghe and Wuqing in Tianjin Special District, a total of 44,661 cotton planting mutual aid groups were organized, including 350,254 people, accounting for 46.4 percent of the total male and female labor force. Through organization, the nine special districts in the province dug more than 5,000 new wells in the cotton planting work; among them, 21 counties dug more than 30,000 earthen wells. More than 80 percent of the more than 22,000 waterwheels lent out in the province were lent to mutual aid groups.

    Although the cotton planting task in the province has been successfully completed, due to the drought and dry land, the cotton seedlings in some dry land areas have not emerged fully. The cotton planting work in various parts of the province has now shifted to the seedling inspection and replanting stage. For example, more than 80 cotton planting mutual aid groups in Maoshanwei and Songgulin villages in Anguo have become seedling inspection and replanting mutual aid groups. The 161 mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings in these two villages have been completely replanted, and 136 mu have been watered. At present, various places are carrying out watering and replanting or seedling cultivation and transplanting in a tense manner.

### 河北植棉任务超额完成  正继续开展查苗补苗运动

　　河北植棉任务超额完成
    正继续开展查苗补苗运动
    河北省植棉任务已超额完成，现正继续开展查苗补苗运动。该省的抗旱种棉工作，在抗美援朝爱国运动的推动下，已超过原计划二百四十九万余亩。十个专区除个别县份外均超额完成任务。邯郸专区超过任务三十二万四千三百多亩；邢台专区超过任务五十二万多亩；没有种棉习惯的天津专区也超过任务的百分之六十六。
    今春天旱地干，该省植棉计划却超额完成了。主要由于：（一）加强了抗旱种棉的领导。省人民政府杨秀峰主席四月份曾亲赴邯郸、邢台、石家庄、衡水、定县等专区视察植棉情况，进行具体指导。“五一”劳动节前后，为打破区、村干部和部分群众靠天等雨思想，十个专区和七十个县曾组织了干部六千五百三十九人下乡，领导植棉工作。（二）开展了抗美援朝爱国运动，大大提高了农民种棉的情绪。许多地区农民发起了种“抗美棉”“爱国棉”的竞赛。深泽县北白庄等二十九个村经过控诉日本帝国主义烧杀掠夺的种种罪行后，提高了爱国热情，组织劳动互助，担水点种棉花三万六千九百多亩。邢台专区各县经过订立爱国公约和拥护和平公约的签名，许多农民提出：“一个名字一杆枪，齐心种棉，打败美国野心狼”的口号。沙河大掌村在这口号的推动下，种棉超过原计划百分之一百一十六。（三）坚持了“组织第一”的方针，农村的生产力得到进一步的发挥。各地普遍实行人力、畜力变工互助，并广泛发动妇女、儿童、老汉参加劳动。不少地区做到了“男女老幼齐动手，人、畜、工具三不闲”。天津专区据宁河、武清等九个县二千六百六十三个村的统计，共组织了四万四千六百六十一个植棉互助组，包括三十五万零二百五十四人，占男女劳动力总数的百分之四十六点四。经过组织起来，该省九个专区在植棉工作中共打新井五千多眼；其中二十一个县共打土井三万多眼。全省贷出的二万二千余辆水车，百分之八十以上都贷给了互助组。
    目前全省种棉任务虽已胜利完成，但由于天旱地干，部分旱地的棉苗没有出全，全省各地的植棉工作，已转入查苗、补苗阶段。如安国毛山卫、松谷林两村的八十多个种棉互助组又变成了查苗补苗互助组。该两村一百六十一亩缺苗棉田已全部补齐，并挑水浇了一百三十六亩。现各地正紧张地进行浇水补种或养苗移种。
