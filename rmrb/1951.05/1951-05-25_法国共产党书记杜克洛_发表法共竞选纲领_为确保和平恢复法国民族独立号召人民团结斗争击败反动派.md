(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 24th) According to a TASS report from Paris: French Communist Party Secretary Duclos delivered a speech on the 17th at a mass rally of 50,000 people at the Paris Winter Velodrome, explaining the French Communist Party's election program.

Duclos first exposed the unprecedented and shameless conspiracy of the French reactionaries, who are colluding with each other, relying on the so-called new election law, and forming an anti-communist, anti-people American party alliance from socialists to De Gaulle fascists, attempting to maintain the moribund rule of the French reactionary bourgeoisie with fascism.

Duclos then said: In order to effectively counter this attack on freedom and peace, the French Communist Party calls on workers and working people in the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement, as well as all the people, to form a united front with the Communist Party and participate in the election. The French people can and must block the road to fascism and war with strong unity and struggle. He said: Now is the time for us to unite most broadly with the most unwavering determination and the most resolute spirit. The French Communist Party has raised high the banner of the unity of the masses in struggle.

Duclos then explained in detail the goals and various aspects of the French Communist Party's struggle and election program. He pointed out: The Communist Party is most concerned with ensuring peace and restoring France's independence, and advocates the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. The Communist Party advocates: the abolition of all treaties that infringe on French independence, such as the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Pact, etc.; the restoration of the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, which is a guarantee of security and peace; disarmament; a strict ban on atomic weapons; the outlawing of war propaganda; the elimination of German militarism and the conclusion of a treaty with a democratic, unified, and peace-loving Germany; the termination of the war in Vietnam and the recall of the expeditionary forces. The Communist Party program stipulates a substantial reduction in military spending, improved living standards for working people, and strengthened democratic rights for the people.

Duclos announced that the Communist Party is willing to participate in or support a government whose basic task is such a policy of peace and democracy. The Communist Party is willing to work with French men and women of all beliefs and faiths to implement a policy that can create conditions for the establishment of such a government, a government fully determined to stop the headlong rush towards doom.

Duclos said: We communists have chosen democracy and chosen peace. Every sincere French man and woman is gradually recognizing this truth: without the Communist Party, it would be impossible to save democracy and defend peace, just as it was impossible to liberate the country from Nazi occupation without the Communist Party.

Duclos finally called on all good French men and women to vote in the election for the candidates of the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance proposed by the French Communist Party in order to save France and save peace!

　　法国共产党书记杜克洛
    发表法共竞选纲领
    为确保和平恢复法国民族独立号召人民团结斗争击败反动派
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党书记杜克洛十七日在巴黎冬季赛车场五万人的群众大会上发表演说，说明法国共产党的竞选纲领。
    杜克洛首先揭露法国反动派空前的无耻阴谋，他们正凭借所谓新选举法，狼狈为奸，结成从社会党人到戴高乐法西斯分子的反共反人民的美国党联盟，企图以法西斯主义来维持法国反动资产阶级的垂死统治。
    杜克洛接着说：为了有效地还击这种对于自由与和平的进攻，法国共产党号召社会党和人民共和党内的工人和劳动人民及全体人民与共产党结成统一战线，参加选举。法国人民能够而且必须用坚强的团结和斗争来堵塞走向法西斯主义与战争的道路。他说：目前已经是我们以最不可动摇的决心和最坚决的精神最广泛地团结起来的时候了。法国共产党高高举起了人民大众在斗争中团结一致的大旗。
    杜克洛然后详细说明了法国共产党奋斗的目标和竞选纲领的各个方面。他指出：共产党最关切的是确保和平及恢复法国的独立，主张五大国缔结和平公约。共产党主张：废除一切侵犯法国独立的条约，如马歇尔计划、大西洋公约等等；恢复法苏同盟条约，这是安全与和平的保证；裁减军备；严格禁止原子武器；用法律手段取缔战争宣传；肃清德国军国主义并且与民主、统一与爱好和平的德国缔结和约；终止在越南的战争并召回远征军。共产党纲领规定大量削减军事开支，提高劳动人民生活水平，加强人民的民主权利。
    杜克洛宣布，共产党愿意参加或支持以这种和平与民主的政策为基本任务的政府。共产党愿意和抱着各种信念和信仰的法国男女共同努力，来推行一种可以为成立这样一个政府而创造条件的政策，这个政府有充分决心制止奔向死路。
    杜克洛说：我们共产党人选择了民主，选择了和平。每一个真诚的法国男女都渐渐认识了这个真理：如果没有共产党，就不可能拯救民主，也不可能保卫和平，正如没有了共产党就不可能把国家从纳粹占领下解放出来一样。
    杜克洛最后号召全体善良的法国男女，在选举中投票拥护法国共产党所提出的共和反法西斯抵抗联盟的候选人，以拯救法国、拯救和平！
