The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to specifically help the city's Party propagandists, reporters, theoretical instructors, political instructors, and cadres who are self-studying Marxism-Leninism to conduct learning and work, established a Party Research Office (referred to as the Party Office) on April 4. This is a new method of learning from the Soviet Union to improve the propaganda and education work of the Party committee.

The tasks of the Party Office are: (1) To establish regular contact with the city's theoretical and political instructors, guide and assist their teaching work, answer their questions, and provide them with the materials needed for teaching. (2) To help reporters, propagandists, and propaganda cadres of Party organizations at all levels collect materials on current affairs policies, answer questions, and conduct study and research. (3) To help cadres who are self-studying Marxist-Leninist theory to carry out learning, discuss their learning plans with them, and provide reading lists and learning materials.

The director of the Party Office is concurrently held by the deputy director of the Propaganda Department, with one deputy director, two researchers, and three staff members. The work that has already begun includes the following: (1) Answering questions: If theoretical instructors, political instructors, reporters, propagandists, and self-studying on-the-job cadres in Beijing have questions about theory, policy, or current affairs, they can raise them to the Party Office. The office stipulates that in principle it must "answer every question" and strive to answer it in a timely and accurate manner. If the office cannot answer the question, it will ask relevant agencies and experts to assist in answering. In addition to oral, telephone, and written answers, it is also prepared to invite experts to make reports or organize articles for public publication in newspapers and periodicals. (2) Supplying books and materials: The Party Office has now collected about 3,000 books and arranged a reading room for designated personnel to borrow. Among them, about 1,000 books are on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, about 1,000 are on current affairs policies, and there are also reference charts on political economy, the history of the CPSU, and propaganda materials published in various places. Recently, books and materials on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea have been displayed in the reading room for Party propagandists to consult at any time. (3) Compiling indexes and materials: At present, "Index of Major Materials for Popularizing and Deepening the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" and propaganda materials "Figures and Facts" have been compiled and printed and distributed to propagandists, and supplementary teaching materials for political instructors are being prepared. In the future, indexes of newspaper and periodical materials on current affairs policies and theory will be compiled regularly. (4) Discussing the study plans of cadres who are self-studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and introducing them to learning materials.
