Title: Pay Attention to Film Criticism, Don't Treat it as Commercial Advertising

To the Editor:

　　After the film "The Life of Wu Xun" was released, from December of last year until the publication of "Wu Xun: Not a Worthy Example" in "Literary Gazette" at the end of April this year, the commentary articles published in newspapers and periodicals in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and other places mostly gave undue praise and laudation to the character of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Why, during such a long period of time, did we not see an article with a more correct viewpoint that forcefully pointed out the serious ideological errors existing in this film? This is not unrelated to the insufficient understanding of film criticism work by everyone (especially comrades in literary and art circles). As far as I personally know, some comrades had actually discovered the principled problems existing in the film before that, but they did not pay attention to them and point them out in a timely and serious manner.

　　Due to this reason, in fact, many of the films screened across the country in the past have not received appropriate comments, which is a huge loss on the ideological front.

　　Although everyone knows that film is one of the best art forms for educating the masses, how many of our comrades in literary and art circles have truly cared about the film industry ideologically? Many comrades would rather spend a lot of time studying a writer or a work (which is of course good), but few people seriously study film art and regularly write film review articles. Until now, we have not found an expert who is wholeheartedly dedicated to film criticism, which is undoubtedly a major regret in our literary and art circles!

　　Here, we must point out that some newspapers and periodicals also do not pay enough attention to film reviews. They publish review articles casually without conducting good research on the film, introducing poisonous films to readers. To change this phenomenon, it is necessary to require everyone to clearly recognize the importance of film criticism work ideologically and oppose treating it as commercial advertising. The articles published in Shanghai's "Popular Cinema" are mostly pure praise for the films. Are these films really without any criticizable shortcomings? Or is it that the editorial department is unwilling to publish articles commenting on the shortcomings of films? This issue deserves attention.

　　The discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is of great educational significance to us ideologically, and I hope everyone will start paying more attention to film criticism work from now on!

### 要重视影片的评论工作  不能把它当作商业广告

　　要重视影片的评论工作  不能把它当作商业广告编辑同志：
    影片《武训传》放映以后，从去年十二月开始，直到今年四月底《文艺报》发表《不足为训的武训》为止，上海、天津、北京等地报刊发表的评论文章，大都对武训这一人物和《武训传》这一影片，作了不应有的推崇和赞誉。在这样长久的一段时间里，为什么我们没有看到一篇观点比较正确的文章，有力地指出这一影片存在的严重思想错误呢？这和大家（尤其文艺界同志）对影片评论工作认识的不足也不无关系。据我个人所知道的，在这以前，有些同志实际早已发现该片中存在的原则性问题了的，但并没有加以重视，并及时严正指出。
    由于这一原因，实际上，过去全国各地放映的影片中许多都没有得到适当的评论，这是思想战线上巨大的损失。
    虽然，谁都知道，电影是教育人民群众最好的文艺形式之一，可是，我们文艺界同志有几个人真正从思想上关心了电影事业呢？许多同志宁可把许多时间花费在对一位作家或一部作品的研究上（这当然也是好的），但很少有人认真地研究过电影艺术，经常写作影片评论的文章。直到现在为止，我们还没有发现一位全心全意致力影片评论的专家，这不能不说是我们文艺界的一大缺憾！
    在这里，我们必须指出，有些报刊对影片评论的重视也是很不够的，他们对影片不经过很好研究，便随便发表评论文章，把有毒素的影片介绍给读者。要改变这一现象，必须要求大家在思想上明确认识影片评论工作的重要性，反对把它看成商业性的宣传广告。上海《大众电影》里发表的文章，绝大多数都是对影片的单纯的赞扬，难道这些影片真个毫无可批判的缺点？还是编辑部不愿发表评论影片缺点的文章呢？这一问题是值得注意的。
    《武训传》的讨论，对我们思想上的教育是很大的，并希望大家从现在起，开始多多注意影片评论工作！
