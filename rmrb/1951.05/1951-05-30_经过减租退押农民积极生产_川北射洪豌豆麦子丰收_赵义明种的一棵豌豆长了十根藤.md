    After Rent Reduction and Deposit Refunds, Farmers Actively Produce
    Good Harvest of Peas and Wheat in Shehong, Northern Sichuan
    Zhao Yiming Grows a Pea Plant with Ten Vines
To the Editor:
    I'm reporting good news to you: After rent reduction and deposit refunds in Shehong County, Northern Sichuan, this year's peas and wheat have had another bumper harvest.

    Zhao Yiming, a farmer from the fourth group of Changle Village, Gujing Township, Seventh District of Shehong County, hung a pea vine he grew on a bamboo pole to celebrate this year's May Day. This pea vine has a total of ten branches and grew from a single seed. The roots under the seed are one foot and two inches long, the stem is nine feet and six inches long, and it has a total of one hundred and sixteen pods. The masses who participated in the May Day rally all scrambled to see this big pea plant.

    The barley grown by Heng Yuanxing, a farmer near Gongqiao Bridge, Baihe Village, Xinlong Township, Jinshan District, Shehong County, has two ears on one stem. When the township government held a meeting, everyone admired this double-eared wheat.

    The farmers of Shehong County, responding to the call of the People's Government, are meticulously cultivating the land. Furthermore, the rainfall in March and April this year was well-distributed. Therefore, the yields of beans and wheat generally increased by 30 to 40 percent compared to normal years; in some places, the yield increased by 70 to 80 percent or more than doubled.

    经过减租退押农民积极生产
    川北射洪豌豆麦子丰收
    赵义明种的一棵豌豆长了十根藤编辑同志：
    报告你一个好消息：川北射洪县经过减租退押以后，今年的豌豆和麦子又都丰收了。
    射洪县第七区古井乡长乐村第四组农民赵义明，为了庆祝今年五一劳动节，他用一根竹竿悬挂了他种的一棵豌豆藤，这一棵豌豆藤共有十根支藤，是一粒种子上长出来的。种子下的根有一尺二寸长，茎有九尺六寸长，共结角一百一十六个。参加五一大会的群众都争先恐后抢着看这棵大豌豆。
    射洪县金山区新隆乡白鹤村拱桥附近的农民衡元兴所种的大麦，一茎双穗。乡政府开会时，大家看了这双穗麦都很羡慕。
    射洪县农民响应人民政府的号召，精耕细作，又加上今年三四两月，雨水调匀，因此豆、麦收成一般的都比常年增加了三至四成；有的地方竟比常年增加产量七、八成或超过一倍。
