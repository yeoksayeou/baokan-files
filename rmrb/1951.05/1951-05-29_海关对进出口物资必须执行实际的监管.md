Customs Must Enforce Actual Supervision of Import and Export Goods
Deputy Director of the General Administration of Customs, Ding Guitang

Article 2 of the Provisional Customs Law stipulates: "The Customs of the People's Republic of China, in accordance with this law and the decrees and decisions of the Central People's Government on foreign trade control, shall exercise actual supervision over goods, currencies, gold and silver, postal items, passenger luggage, means of transport, and items carried by their service personnel entering and leaving the country..." The purpose of this actual supervision is to prevent items harmful to national production and construction or items that should not be exported from sneaking in or flowing out, and to ensure the implementation of foreign trade policies.

There is an opinion that while customs supervision of private import and export goods is necessary, supervision of state-owned goods is superfluous, delays cargo transportation, and hinders the exchange of materials. I believe this opinion is incorrect. In the advanced socialist country of the Soviet Union, foreign trade is entirely managed by the state, and all import and export goods are handled by state-owned companies, and work is carried out according to plan; but customs still exist, import and export goods must still apply for licenses, and customs must still implement supervision and inspection, and customs must supervise, inspect, and record them at the time of import and export, in order to correct shortcomings and errors in a timely manner, and prevent sabotage by capitalist countries. In our New Democratic China, foreign trade includes both public and private sectors, and the level of awareness and professional knowledge of the staff has generally not yet reached the ideal standard, and shortcomings and deviations in work are inevitable. Based on Customs' experience in supervising and inspecting import and export goods over the past year, there have been instances of goods declared as A but found to be B upon inspection; goods declared as permissible imports but found to be prohibited imports; goods declared as specification A but found to be specification B; goods declared as tax classification A but found to be classification B; understated weights; overstated prices; incomplete or missing documents, or false documents at the time of declaration; and other situations that do not comply with customs regulations, such as transporting goods away before customs declaration or taking delivery without inspection. If these chaotic situations are not supervised, inspected, and corrected by the Customs when goods enter or leave the country, it will inevitably affect the state's control of foreign trade and the implementation of tariff policies, and have an adverse impact on the country's entire economic plan.

Does customs supervision delay cargo transportation and affect the exchange of materials at home and abroad? The facts of the past year prove that the occurrence of certain phenomena of delayed material transportation or hindering domestic and foreign exchanges is mainly not due to customs supervision, but mostly due to delays in submitting licenses, missing or incomplete documents, false information, disagreements over valuation, or delays in customs declaration and tax payment. The new Customs' supervision procedures have been simplified as much as possible in recent years. According to the current degree of simplification, generally speaking, if the documents are complete and the goods match the declaration, customs procedures should be completed within two hours to one day. For goods that are complex and require detailed inspection or testing, the customs can issue a customs duty payment certificate within a maximum of two to five days. If the owner can pay taxes in a timely manner, the goods can be released within these two or five days. Therefore, customs supervision should not have a serious impact on cargo transportation and material exchange. Of course, within the realm of possibility, we should continue to simplify supervision procedures in the future. We hope that the people of the whole country and relevant departments will actively help supervise and offer criticisms and suggestions.

　　海关对进出口物资必须执行实际的监管
    海关总署副署长  丁贵堂
    暂行海关法第二条中规定：“中华人民共和国海关，依据本法和中央人民政府对外贸易管制的法令和决定，对进出国境的货物、货币、金银、邮递物品、旅客行李、运输工具及其服务人员所带物品，执行实际的监管……”。这种实际的监管，目的是不使有害国家生产建设的东西或不应出口的东西乘隙渗入或流出，保证对外贸易政策的贯彻执行。
    有一种意见，认为海关对私营进出口物资的监管固有必要，但对国营的监管则是多余的，延误货运和妨碍物资交流的。这种意见，我以为是不正确的。在先进的社会主义国家苏联，对外贸易完全由国家专管，所有进出口物资均由国营公司负责办理，按计划进行工作；但仍设有海关，进出口物资仍须请领许可证，仍须由海关实施监管与查验，仍须由海关在进出口时加以监管、查验、记录，以便及时纠正缺点错误，并防止资本主义国家的破坏。我们新民主主义的中国，对外贸易有公营亦有私营，工作人员的自觉程度和业务知识，一般还未达到理想的标准，工作中更难免发生缺点和偏差。以海关一年来在监管查验进出口物资上所得的经验而论，有报运为甲货而查系乙货的；有报运准许进口货而查系禁止进口货的；有报运规格甲而查系规格乙的；有报运税则分类甲而查系分类乙的；有将重量以多报少的；有将价格以高报低的；有报运时单据不全或无单据或单据不真实的；另外还有不待报关先行运走或未经验放即行提取等不合关章规定的情事。这些混乱情形，如不由海关在物资进出国境时予以监管检查和纠正，势必影响国家对外贸易的管制和关税政策的执行，对国家的整个经济计划发生不利的影响。
    海关监管是否会延误货运和影响内外物资交流呢？一年来的事实证明：某些延误物资运输或阻碍内外交流现象的发生，主要原因不是海关监管，而多半由于延迟缴许可证、无单据或单据不齐、不实、估价不合或延不报关、延不付税。新海关的监管手续，年来已经尽力简化。按现在的简化程度，一般地说，如果单据齐全，单货相符，海关手续在二小时至一天内应可办完。货物复杂须详细查验或化验的，至多也不超过两天到五天，海关就可以发出关税缴纳证。如货主能及时纳税，在这两天或五天内就可以放行。所以海关的监管，对于货运及物资交流不致有严重的影响。当然，在可能范围内，今后仍应继续简化监管手续。希望全国人民和有关部门积极地帮助监督和提出批评建议。
