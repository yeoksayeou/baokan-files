　　A Cotton Farm Guiding Farmers in Improving Cotton Planting Techniques
The plain in the southeast of Wuchang County is a cotton-growing area. Last autumn, 80 percent of the land here was covered with snow-white cotton bolls. This abundant harvest was mainly due to the help of the Xujiapeng Cotton Farm in guiding farmers to improve cotton planting techniques.

　　The Xujiapeng Cotton Farm was originally one of the three major cotton farms in China (the other two being Nantong and Anyang cotton farms), established in 1924. The farm is well-equipped and has more than 200 staff members. Before liberation, these personnel simply sat at home and conducted "closed-door research," and farmers could not even enter the gate of the cotton farm. The entire farm planted more than 1,000 mu of cotton each year, but what was harvested was not even enough for the staff to eat. After liberation, under the call of the People's Government to "serve the people" and "combine science and technology with the actual experience of the masses," the farm staff began to learn from the farmers and guide them to improve cotton planting techniques.

　　In the past, although the cotton planting area in this region was large, the cotton farmers mostly planted mixed cotton seeds, so the yield was not high, with each mu yielding less than sixty jin of seed cotton. Last spring, the Xujiapeng Cotton Farm promoted a large number of Dezi cotton seeds to the farmers. At that time, many cotton farmers said, "The Kuomintang reactionary government also told us to plant this kind of cotton, but the result was that it didn't even sprout." The cotton farm staff then first sowed Dezi cotton seeds, and the resulting cotton seedlings were very robust. The cotton farmers' concerns about "foreign seeds not sprouting" were thus eliminated. At the same time, the cotton farm staff also guaranteed the cotton farmers that if the cotton fields planted with Dezi cotton seeds did not yield as much as ordinary cotton fields, the cotton farm would provide subsidies. In this way, most of the farmers sowed Dezi cotton seeds.

　　Last autumn, just as the cotton plants were growing luxuriantly, many cotton fields were infested with pests such as aphids and red spiders. Seeing the green cotton leaves being eaten by the pests like spider webs, the farmers sighed and said, "These are heavenly insects, there's no way to cure them." At this time, the Xujiapeng Cotton Farm sold a large number of pesticides and pest control equipment to the cotton farmers at low prices; the cotton farm personnel also went to the countryside to specifically help the farmers use various pest control equipment. They carried medicine buckets and sprayers to the farmers' cotton fields to work before dawn every day, and taught the farmers pest control techniques, thus enabling the cotton farmers to quickly learn pest control techniques. During pest control, the cotton farm personnel discovered that farmers in the Qingshan District used yellow tobacco water and glue to kill insects, which saved more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields from pests. After testing by the cotton farm personnel, this method proved that yellow tobacco water and glue were twice as effective in killing insects as sulfur powder, and the price was half that of sulfur powder. The cotton farm personnel then promoted this pest control method to the farmers. After half a month, the pests in the cotton fields in this area were all eliminated.

　　After the autumn harvest, the more than 1,300 mu of cotton fields planted by the Xujiapeng Cotton Farm last year yielded twice as much as the cotton fields of ordinary farmers because they adopted new farming methods. This amazing harvest attracted more than 100,000 farmers to visit the cotton farm. The cotton farm staff took this opportunity to convene cotton farmers for discussions, inquired about their difficulties in cotton planting, and exchanged cotton planting experiences with them, so that scientific farming methods quickly spread to various places. At this time, the Xujiapeng Cotton Farm had established contact with the vast number of farmers and had become the production headquarters for farmers in the cotton-producing area around Wuchang.

　　During March and April this year, when it was almost time to plant cotton, cotton farmers within seventy square li around Wuchang, carrying baskets and bags, flocked to the Xujiapeng Cotton Farm to borrow cotton seeds. In order to better promote good seeds, the cotton farm had already prepared 180,000 jin of Dezi cotton seeds (not including the 600,000 jin prepared by the farmers themselves) last winter, which was four times more than last year, but they were all borrowed by the farmers in less than half a month.

　　一个指导农民改良植棉技术的棉场
    新华社记者  海波
    武昌县东南部的平原，是一个植棉区。去年秋天，这里百分之八十的土地上开放着雪白的棉桃。这一丰盛的收获，主要是徐家棚棉场帮助农民改良植棉技术而得到的。
    徐家棚棉场原为我国三大棉场之一（另两个为南通、安阳棉场），创设于一九二四年。该场设备完善，拥有二百多名工作人员。在解放前，这些人员只是坐在家里“闭门研究”，农民连棉场的大门也不能进。全场每年种一千多亩棉花，但所收获的东西，还不够场内工作人员吃用。解放以后，该场工作人员在人民政府“为人民服务”及“科学技术和群众的实际经验相结合”的号召下，开始向农民学习，并指导农民改良植棉技术。
    过去，这个地区植棉面积虽然很大，但由于棉农大部种的是杂棉种，所以每亩收不到六十斤籽棉，产量不高。去年春天，徐家棚棉场以大批德字棉种，向农民推广。当时很多棉农说：“国民党反动政府统治时，也叫我们种过这样的棉花，可是结果连芽都不发。”棉场人员便首先播种德字棉种，结果所长出的棉苗，都很茁壮。棉农怕“洋籽不发芽”的顾虑才告消除。同时，棉场人员又向棉农保证：凡种了德字棉种的棉田，如果收不到普通棉田那么多，将由棉场给予补贴。这样，大部农民便播种了德字棉种。
    去年秋天，正当棉棵长得枝叶茂盛的时候，很多棉田发生了蚜虫和红蜘蛛等虫害，眼看着绿油油的棉叶被虫子吃得像蜘蛛网一样。于是农民们叹着气说：“这是天虫，没法治。”这时，徐家棚棉场就以低价售给棉农大批杀虫药剂和除虫器械；棉场的人员又全部下乡，具体地帮助农民使用各种除虫药械。他们每天天不亮就挑着药桶，拿着喷雾器到农民的棉田里工作，并教导农民除虫技术，因此，使棉农很快地学会治虫技术。在治虫时，棉场人员发现青山区农民采用黄烟水和胶水杀虫的方法，使三万多亩棉田免除了虫害。这个办法经过棉场人员试验后，证明黄烟水和胶水比硫磺粉的杀虫效力大一倍，而价钱却比硫磺粉便宜一半。棉场人员就将这一除虫方法向农民推广。经过半个月的时间，这一地区棉田中的害虫全部被消灭了。
    秋收后，徐家棚棉场去年所种的一千三百余亩棉田，因为采用了新的耕作方法，比一般农民的棉田多收一倍。这个惊人的收获，吸引了十余万农民前来棉场参观。棉场人员趁此机会召集棉农座谈，询问他们在植棉中的困难，和他们交谈植棉经验，使科学的耕作方法很快传遍了各地。这时，徐家棚棉场已和广大农民建立了联系，已成为武昌一带产棉区农民的生产指挥部。
    今年三、四月间，快要种棉花了，武昌周围七十方里地区内的棉农，每天挑着箩筐，拿着口袋，成群结队地到徐家棚棉场去贷棉种。棉场为了很好地推广良种，早于去冬即准备了十八万斤德字棉种（农民自己准备的六十万斤不在内），比去年多了四倍，可是不到半个月，就被农民贷完了。
