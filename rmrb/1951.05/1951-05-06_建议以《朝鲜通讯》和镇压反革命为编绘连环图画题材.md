　　We have recently received many letters from readers suggesting that publishers and comic strip artists should publish more comic strips with realistic themes—especially the "Korean Correspondence" published in this newspaper and stories of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in various places—to educate the general public.
　　Tang Guangjin from the Changxindian Railway Workers' Children's Middle School wrote: "The content of the comic strips currently appearing before readers is mostly about events from a few years ago. Very few are combined with the current affairs of resisting US aggression, aiding Korea, defending world peace, opposing US imperialism's arming of Japan, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Comic strip artists are very likely to obtain materials in this area, especially in the 'Korean Correspondence,' where many vivid and concrete materials can be found. I hope that comic strip artists will open up more in this area and create better and more works."
　　Beijing No. 11 Middle School wrote in a letter: "In the continued promotion and education work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, we have a suggestion: We hope that publishers and artists will immediately adopt the heroic stories from the 'Korean Correspondence' and turn them into comic strips for mass distribution. Because comic strips are the form most loved by the general public, and the 'Korean Correspondence' is the most popular true story among general readers. Combining the two is the most effective propaganda and education tool."
　　Xiao Miao from Beijing Youth Printing Factory wrote to us, saying that after reading the survey and short review on comic strips published in this publication on April 1st, he was very indignant and advocated that reactionary "little books" should be strictly banned everywhere, "and no longer be 'boundlessly lenient' as in the past when suppressing counter-revolutionaries!" He also mentioned in his letter: "The heroic deeds published in the People's Daily's 'Korean Correspondence' excite and move me every time I read them. But this can only be seen by those who read the newspaper, and has not yet been seen by elementary school students who love to read stories to their mothers, or ordinary citizens, or people on the street who look at 'little books' while looking at the stalls. I suggest: Quickly publish some 'little books' with this kind of realistic theme. This is the most effective way to educate the masses who cannot read long articles."
　　Lu Kening from a certain factory wrote in a similar vein: "Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean people on the battlefield or in the rear have greatly encouraged the high morale of the workers in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and striving for production through news reports. At the same time, the heroic deeds of our volunteer army in the current development of the Korean war are the most concerned by everyone. I hope that the heroic deeds of the volunteer army can be written into novels and drawn into comic strips, which is a good way to carry out in-depth propaganda for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea."
　　Tianjin reader Liu Shanye suggested that the crimes of US imperialist spy Gu Zongfan and the process of his exposure should be drawn into comic strips, writing in his letter: "This is an extremely vivid novel story, showing the power of the people's giant palms." Qingdao reader Shi Weijing expressed his anger at the crimes of the Christian imperialist missionary Gu Ren'en and hoped that comic strip artists would turn this story into a picture book so that it could be "known to every household, young and old."
　　Comic strips compiled with vivid realistic themes have proven to be extremely popular with the masses, such as "A Soldier of Korea," "The First功 of Yunshan," and "Stories on the North Korean Battlefield" recently published by the East China People's Publishing House. In addition, Wende Bookstore has also recently published the comic strip "Vigilance," which expresses the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; it is closely linked to the current political tasks and has also been welcomed by the majority of readers. The opinions put forward by readers are undoubtedly correct and necessary. We suggest that comic strip artists should better explore them in all aspects.

### 建议以《朝鲜通讯》和镇压反革命为编绘连环图画题材

　　建议以《朝鲜通讯》和镇压反革命为编绘连环图画题材
    我们最近接到好些读者来信建议出版者及连环画工作者多出版以现实题材——特别是本报发表的《朝鲜通讯》，以及各地镇压反革命的故事为内容的连环画，以教育广大人民。
    长辛店铁路职工子弟中学唐广金来信说：“现在出现在读者面前的连环画的内容大都是几年前的事情，与现在的抗美援朝、保卫世界和平、反对美帝国主义武装日本及镇压反革命的时事结合的很少，连环画工作者很可能在这方面取得材料，尤其在《朝鲜通讯》上更可能得到很多生动具体的材料。希望连环画工作者在这方面多开辟，创作出更好更多的作品。”
    北京市第十一中学来信说：“在继续展开抗美援朝的宣教工作中，我们有一个建议，就是：希望出版者和艺术工作者，立即采用《朝鲜通讯》中的英雄故事画成连环图画，大量供应。因为连环图画是一般群众所最喜爱的形式，而朝鲜通讯又是最受一般读者欢迎的真实故事。两者结合起来是一种最有效的宣教工具。”
    北京青年印刷厂晓苗给我们来信，说他看了四月一日本刊发表的关于连环画的阅读调查和短评后，非常愤慨，主张各地应该严厉取缔反动的小人书，“再不要象过去镇压反革命一样的‘宽大无边’了！”他来信也说到：“人民日报《朝鲜通讯》登载着的英雄事迹，每篇看了都使我兴奋感动。但这只能使看报的人看到，还没让爱念故事给妈妈听的小学生们及普通市民们看到，或者是大街上一面看着货摊一面看‘小人书’的人看到。我建议：赶快出些以这一类现实题材为内容的小人书吧。这是最能教育不能看大篇文章的大众的。”
    某厂鲁克宁来信同样说到：“自朝鲜战争爆发迄今，中朝人民在战场上或后方的英勇事迹，通过通讯报道，大大地鼓舞了工友同志抗美援朝努力生产的高度情绪。同时，对今天朝鲜战局的发展，我志愿军可歌可泣的英勇事迹，是每一个人最关心的事。我希望将志愿军的英勇事迹，写成小说书，绘成连环图画，这是深入抗美援朝宣传的好办法”。
    天津读者刘善业来信建议以美帝国主义特务顾宗范等的罪行及其破获的经过，绘成连环图画，来信说：“这是一部极生动的小说故事，表现了人民巨掌的力量。”青岛读者史伟竞来信表示对于基督教的帝国主义传教士顾仁恩的罪恶的愤恨，希望连环画工作者把这一故事画成画册，以便“家喻户晓，老少咸知”。
    采用生动的现实题材编绘的连环画，证明是极受群众欢迎的，如《朝鲜一兵》，《云山第一功》和华东人民出版社最近出版的《朝北战场上的故事》。另外文德书局最近也出版了表现镇压反革命的连环画《警惕》；它和目前政治任务紧紧结合，也得到广大读者的欢迎。读者所提这些意见，无疑都是正确而必要的，我们建议连环画工作者应更好地从各方面加以发掘。
