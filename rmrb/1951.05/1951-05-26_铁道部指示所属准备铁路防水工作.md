　　The Ministry of Railways Directs Subordinates to Prepare for Railway Flood Prevention Work

    As the rainy season approaches, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government recently instructed its subordinates to actively prepare for railway flood prevention work. The Ministry of Railways has decided that railway departments in various regions should first carefully investigate locations where water damage may occur, accurately estimate the quantity of materials needed for flood prevention and prepare storage locations, so that they can quickly respond to emergencies in the event of a disaster. Secondly, joint defense organizations should be established, and workers should be mobilized to study the flood fighting plans and related technologies for their sections, so that every worker can recognize the importance of flood prevention. Thirdly, a water damage information network should be established, labor should be organized correctly, and waste and abuse should be strictly prevented. In addition, the Ministry of Railways is also preparing to strengthen ties with water conservancy departments to exchange hydrological data and information. During the flood season, if either side encounters dangerous projects, they should assist each other as much as possible with manpower, materials and transportation equipment.

    因雨季将到，中央人民政府铁道部最近指示所属积极准备铁路的防水工作。铁道部决定：各地铁路部门首先要仔细调查可能发生水害的处所，精密估计防水需用材料数量及准备储放地点，以便一旦发生灾害迅速抢险。其次，应建立联防机构，发动职工学习本段水害抢险计划及有关技术，使每个职工都能认识到防水的重要。第三，建立水害情报网，正确组织劳动力，严防浪费滥用。此外，铁道部并准备与水利部门加强联系，互通水文资料情报。防汛期间双方如有险工，在人力器材及交通设备上应尽可能做到互相协助。
