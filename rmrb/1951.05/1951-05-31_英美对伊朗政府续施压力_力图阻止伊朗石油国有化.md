　　Anglo-American Pressure Continues on Iranian Government
　　Attempting to Prevent Nationalization of Iranian Oil

Xinhua News Agency, 28th. British and American imperialists continue to exert pressure on the Iranian government, attempting to prevent the implementation of the Iranian oil nationalization bill. The British Ministry of Defence announced on the 25th that the 16th Independent Parachute Brigade would be sent to the Mediterranean to "strengthen the security of the area." According to Reuters, they will be sent to Iran "when necessary." On the 26th, the British government filed a "complaint" with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, requesting the court to arbitrate the Iranian oil issue. At the same time, Britain has asked certain Middle Eastern and Asian countries related to Iranian oil to jointly exert pressure on the Iranian government.

The US government is also actively taking threatening measures against the Iranian government. The *Daily Express* correspondent in Washington said that the US State Department "most sympathizes with the British sentiment that it is necessary to take military action to protect British lives and property." Following the State Department's statement on the 18th interfering in Iran's internal affairs, US Ambassador to Iran Grady submitted a note to the Iranian Foreign Ministry on the 26th. The note threatened the Iranian government, saying: "The serious dispute between Iran and Britain will harm the unity of the free world and seriously weaken the free world (referring to the imperialist bloc)." The note said that the United States opposes the Iranian government taking measures with the nature of confiscation and seizure.

　　英美对伊朗政府续施压力
    力图阻止伊朗石油国有化
    【新华社二十八日讯】英、美帝国主义者继续对伊朗政府使用压力，力图阻止伊朗石油国有化法案的实行。英国国防部二十五日宣布：英国伞兵第十六独立旅将被派往地中海，“加强该区的警卫”。据路透社承认：他们将在“必要时”被派往伊朗。二十六日，英国政府向海牙国际法庭提出一“控诉书”，要求该法庭仲裁伊朗的石油问题。与此同时，英国已要求某些与伊朗石油有关的中东和亚洲国家共同对伊朗政府使用压力。
    美国政府亦正积极对伊朗政府采取威胁手段。《每日快报》驻华盛顿记者说：美国国务院“最同情英国的情绪，这种情绪认为有采取军事行动以保护英国人生命和财产的必要”。在本月十八日国务院发表干涉伊朗内政的声明后，美国驻伊大使格拉第又于二十六日向伊朗外交部提出一项照会。该照会恫吓伊朗政府说：“伊朗与英国之间的严重争执，会损害自由世界的团结，并严重削弱自由世界（按指帝国主义集团）”。照会说：美国反对伊朗政府采取带有没收与夺取性质的措施。
