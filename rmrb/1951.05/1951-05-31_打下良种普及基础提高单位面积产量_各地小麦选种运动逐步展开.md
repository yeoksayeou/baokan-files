To lay the foundation for popularizing improved varieties and increasing yield per unit area, wheat seed selection campaigns have gradually unfolded across various regions.

With the summer harvest season approaching, various regions, aiming to increase wheat yield per unit area and lay the foundation for the popularization of improved varieties, have gradually launched summer seed selection campaigns.

According to the draft Five-Year Plan for the Popularization of Improved Grain Crop Varieties issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and in light of the specific conditions of Pingyuan Province, wheat seed selection is being carried out in two types of areas. First, in counties where the preliminary selection process was completed last year and initial selected seeds were produced, county selection meetings will not be held this year to select initial selected seeds. These counties should, on the existing basis, universally guide the masses to carry out field selection, self-retention of seeds, or mutual exchange of seeds. County leaders should conduct in-depth inspections of the good varieties already planted in farm breeding areas and seed retention fields. If they are indeed good varieties, in addition to expanding seed retention fields to continue breeding, ear selection should also be carried out to improve quality for use in autumn breeding this year. Second, in counties where seed selection work was poor last year, a broad evaluation campaign should be launched this year to re-select initial selected seeds. These counties should establish seed selection committees at all levels twenty days before the wheat harvest, fully mobilize the masses to conduct field visits and comparisons, and select village seeds to participate in the county-wide evaluation. Currently, Xinxiang and other special districts in the province have launched seed selection campaigns, and the masses have put forward slogans such as "Selecting good wheat seeds leads to more grain, patriotic production has strength," and "To know which wheat seed is good, first go to the field to compare."

Henan Province has determined the following four types of areas to carry out wheat seed selection: First, sixteen counties, including Xuchang, Xiangyang, Luoyang, and Shangqiu, are designated as key evaluation counties, requiring the completion of evaluation work this year. Second, eight counties, including Chenliu and Kaifeng, are designated as deputy key seed selection counties, requiring the expansion of wheat seed selection area this year by two times compared to last year. Third, in eleven counties with better conditions, such as Ye County and Linru, it is required to select two to four townships to do a good job in evaluation and experimentation. Fourth, in general counties, a universal call is made to mobilize the masses to select and exchange seeds. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Agricultural College of Henan University have organized more than two hundred people to go to various key counties on May 10 to assist in leading the seed selection work. At present, Shangqiu Special Office has universally launched a seed selection competition between districts, townships, villages, and individuals.

In the Northwest region's Shaanxi Province, since Zhang Mingliang and other forty-seven mutual aid teams in Xingping County issued a challenge to the wheat-producing areas across the country for summer harvest and summer selection, twenty-seven mutual aid teams in Wangmang Village, Xi'an County, and Huangzhuang Village in the suburbs of Xi'an City, and thirteen mutual aid teams in Huangjia Village have proposed to accept the challenge. In terms of challenge conditions, combined with the specific local conditions, it is emphasized that wheat varieties that can resist wheat midges and are not afraid of wind and rain should be selected. In addition, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and other provinces are also enthusiastically carrying out wheat seed selection campaigns.

　　打下良种普及基础提高单位面积产量
    各地小麦选种运动逐步展开
    夏收季节快到，各地为了提高小麦单位面积产量和打下良种普及基础，已逐步展开夏季选种运动。
    平原省根据中央人民政府农业部颁发的粮食作物五年良种普及计划草案和本省具体情况，分两种地区进行小麦选种。第一是去年已经作好评选工作产生了初选种的县份，今年即不再召开县评选会评选初选种。这些县份应在现有基础上，普遍领导群众进行田间选种、自留种或互相换种。县领导干部应深入检查农场繁殖区、留种地已种的良种。如确系良种，除扩大留种地继续进行繁殖外，并应进行穗选，提高品质，作为本县今年秋季繁殖使用。第二是去年选种工作较差的县份，今年应广泛开展评选运动，重新选出初选种。这些县份在小麦收割前二十天应成立各级选种委员会，充分发动群众进行田间参观、评比，选出村选种，以参加全县评选。目前该省新乡等专区，已开展选种运动，群众已提出“选好麦种多打粮，爱国增产有力量”、“要知那样麦种好，先到地里去比较”等口号。
    河南省已确定以下四种地区进行小麦选种：一、以许昌、襄阳、洛阳、商邱等十六县为重点评选县，要求在今年完成评选工作。二、以陈留、开封等八县为副重点选种县，要求今年的小麦选种面积比去年扩大二倍。三、在条件较好的叶县、临汝等十一县，要求选择二至四个乡，做好评选试验。四、一般县普遍号召，动员群众选种换种。该省农林厅及河南大学农学院等单位，已组织二百余人于五月十日分赴各重点县协助领导选种工作。目前商邱专署已普遍展开区与区、乡与乡、村与村、个人与个人的选种竞赛运动。
    西北区陕西省自兴平县张明亮等四十七个互助组向全国产麦区提出夏收、夏选挑战后，目前已有西安县王蟒村、西安市郊区黄庄村二十七个互助组及黄家庄十三个互助组提出应战。在应战条件上，结合当地具体情况强调提出要选能抵抗吸浆虫和不怕风、不怕雨的麦种。此外，河北、山西、江西、广东、广西、湖南等省亦正热烈展开小麦选种运动。
