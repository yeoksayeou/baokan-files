Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Fuzhou dispatch: The Fuzhou Municipal Military Control Commission, responding to the demands of the broad masses of the city's people, convened a public trial on April 24th and executed a batch of arch-criminal counter-revolutionaries by firing squad. Over 1,700 representatives from all sectors attended the public trial, and 100,000 citizens throughout the city listened to the live broadcast of the public trial. On the streets of the city, citizens gathered in the rain to listen under loudspeakers installed specifically for the broadcast of the conference.

At the public trial, family members of the victims angrily accused the counter-revolutionaries of their crimes. Citizen Lin Jiu Sao, while accusing special agent and habitual bandit Cheng Jinmei of killing her husband (a revolutionary guerrilla), sobbed uncontrollably and eventually fainted on the stage. Old Mrs. Han, over seventy years old, was helped onto the stage by her daughter and niece, tearfully recounting the tragic circumstances of her son Han Zengguan's murder by the Cheng bandit: Cheng bandit strangled Han Zengguan, then cut off his head and punctured his body. Wu Botang, seventy-eight years old, trembling and unable to speak through tears, accused Kuomintang military intelligence agent Chen Chunfu of killing his son, Han Zengguan, who was participating in land reform. These tearful accusations were repeatedly interrupted by angry slogans from the masses. Representatives attending the meeting and the masses listening to the broadcast outside the venue shouted in unison: "Support the People's Government, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!" "Avenge the dead!"

The five telephones specially set up for the conference continuously received opinions from the broad masses demanding severe punishment for counter-revolutionaries, reporting their plans to assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionary activities; they also continuously sent representatives to the venue to express condolences to the families of the victims.

The batch of counter-revolutionaries publicly tried were all stained with blood and committed numerous evils. Among them, military intelligence agent Chen Chunfu and other ten principal criminals had murdered 242 revolutionary cadres and people, injured 175 people, raped 128 women, and looted countless properties. Special agent and bandit Cheng Jinmei led bandit troops in dozens of villages in the Shoushan area of the eighth district of Minhou before the liberation of Fujian to "encircle and suppress" our people's guerrillas, killing eleven of our cadres and people; after the area was liberated, Cheng bandit colluded with bandit leader Ren Bisheng to kill twenty-three peasants including Xu Zhenliu. Among this batch of counter-revolutionaries, there were also some special agent spies who, after the liberation of Fujian, accepted missions from the US-Chiang Kai-shek secret service agencies to infiltrate our organs, steal confidential documents, and gather intelligence. For example, the spy Chen Fuxing infiltrated the Fujian Provincial People's Government Highway Bureau as a traffic policeman and, under the direction of special agent leader Mao Sen, secretly set up a radio station to report our military and political intelligence to the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan. There were also some habitual bandits and despotic landlords. For example, the despotic landlord Sun Liyi alone murdered seventeen peasants.

When the people of Fuzhou heard the chief judge of the municipal military control commission's temporary court announce on the radio that he was accepting the demands of the broad masses and, in accordance with the regulations for punishing counter-revolutionaries, sentenced this batch of counter-revolutionaries to death and immediately executed them by firing squad, they all applauded and cheered. When the prisoner carts escorting the criminals passed through the city, the citizens crowded to watch, and cheers resounded like thunder. An old lady happily said, "Thank the People's Government for ridding us of the scourge."

　　福州公审处决一批反革命分子
    受害者控诉特务罪行十万人收听广播
    【新华社上海六日电】福州讯：福州市军事管制委员会接受全市广大人民的要求，于四月二十四日召开公审大会，枪决了一批反革命首恶分子。参加公审大会的有各界代表一千七百多人，全市并有十万市民收听公审大会实况的广播。市区马路上特为收听大会广播而装设的扩音器下，市民群众冒雨围听。
    在公审大会上，被害者家属愤怒地控诉了反革命分子的罪行。市民林九嫂控诉特务惯匪程金妹杀害她丈夫（革命游击队员）时，泣不成声，最后昏倒在台上。七十多岁的韩老太太，由女儿和侄媳扶到台上，一字一泪地哭诉了她儿子韩增官被程匪弄死的惨况：程匪勒死了韩增官，又割去了他的头，戳破了他的尸体。七十八岁的吴伯堂控诉国民党军统特务陈春茀杀害他参加土地改革的儿子时，他浑身发抖，哭得站在台上说不出话来。这些血泪的控诉，不断为群众激怒的口号所中断。到会代表和会外收听广播的群众，一齐高呼：“拥护人民政府，坚决镇压反革命！”“为死难者报仇！”。
    大会专设的五架电话，不断地收到广大群众要求严厉惩办反革命分子的意见，报告他们协助人民政府镇压反革命工作的计划；他们并不断地选派代表到会场上慰问受难者的家属。
    被公审的一批反革命分子，都是血债累累，作恶多端。其中军统特务陈春茀等十个首恶分子，就曾杀害革命干部和人民群众二百四十二人，杀伤人民群众一百七十五人，强奸妇女一百二十八名，抢掠财物无数。特务匪徒程金妹，在福建解放前曾率匪军在闽侯八区寿山等数十村“清剿”我人民游击队，杀害我干部及人民群众十一名；该地解放后，程匪又勾结股匪任必升杀害农民徐真流等二十三人。在这一批反革命分子中，还有一些是福建解放后接受美蒋特务机关使命，打入我机关内部，窃取机密文件和刺探情报的特务间谍分子。如间谍陈复兴混入我福建省人民政府公路局任交通警察，受特务头子毛森指使，密设电台向台湾国民党残匪报告我军政情报。还有一些是惯匪和恶霸地主。如恶霸地主孙利礼一人即曾杀害农民十七人。
    福州全市人民从广播中听到市军事管制委员会临时法庭审判长宣布接受广大群众要求，依据惩治反革命条例判处这批反革命分子死刑并即执行枪决时，莫不拍掌称快。押解犯人的槛车经过市区时，市民群众争相观看，欢声雷动。一个老太太高兴地说：“感谢人民政府为我们除了祸害。”
