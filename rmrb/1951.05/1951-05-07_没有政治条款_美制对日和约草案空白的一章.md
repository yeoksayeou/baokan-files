　　No Political Clauses
    —A Blank Chapter in the American Draft Treaty with Japan
    Li Chunqing
    War is a continuation of politics, and a treaty ending a war should implement the goals of the war. One of the greatest goals of the war against Japan was to overthrow Japanese fascist militarism and give the Japanese people democracy and freedom. This goal was clearly stipulated in the Potsdam Proclamation and should be implemented, and should not be arbitrarily distorted or erased by the United States.
    Article 6 of the Potsdam Proclamation stipulates: "There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world." Article 10 stipulates: "The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established." Article Twelve stipulates: “A peacefully inclined and responsible government will be established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people…”. According to these three articles, in a negative sense, the following should be eliminated: 1. The "authority" that led the aggression, 2. The "influence" that led the aggression, 3. "Obstacles to democracy." In a positive sense, the following should be guaranteed: 1. "The basic freedoms and human rights of the Japanese people," 2. A "peacefully inclined and responsible government" established based on popular democracy; to eliminate Japanese militarism and safeguard peace in the Far East.
    These goals should be stipulated in the treaty, as was done in the treaty with Italy. Article 15 of that treaty stipulates: "Italy shall take all measures necessary to secure to all persons under Italian jurisdiction, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, of press and publication, of religious worship, of political opinion and of public meeting." This is a provision on the positive side. Article 17: "Italy, having, in accordance with Article 3 of the Armistice Agreement, effectively disbanded the Fascist organizations which existed in Italy, shall not permit the reconstitution in any form whatsoever of organizations of a similar character whether political, military or semi-military, whose aim it is to deprive the people of their democratic rights." This is a provision on the negative side.
    The political clauses that should be in the American draft treaty with Japan are a blank chapter. Although there are a few very simple sentences in the preamble, namely: "Desiring that conditions of stability and well-being should be created in Japan in accordance with Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, a point which has begun to be realized by Japan's post-war legislation." These vague sentences are neither political clauses nor legally binding.
    According to Articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter, this falls within the scope of "international economic and social cooperation," and the so-called "conditions of stability and well-being" are vague and programmatic. Although Article 55 lists three objectives, the last one is: "universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion." However, the United Nations can only "promote" and cannot force the implementation of these objectives on its member states. Therefore, what is contained in the preamble of the American draft treaty with Japan is not compulsory for Japan and has no legal power. Japan can disrespect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and can arbitrarily revive fascist politics without any restrictions. Furthermore, the American United Nations has lost its international moral dignity and distorted the meaning of peace and democracy. Of course, it will not make things difficult for the Japanese reactionaries and will not "promote" Japan's true democracy, which is contrary to the interests of the United States.
    Even so, in the preamble, after just mentioning a glimmer of hope, it is immediately erased by "a point which has begun to be realized by Japan's post-war legislation." That is to say, Japan has already realized the "conditions of stability and well-being" in its post-war legislation, everything is very democratic, and the Allied powers in the war against Japan should no longer have any political demands on the defeated country of Japan in the treaty.
    The Allied countries that fought against Japan, especially China and the Soviet Union, absolutely cannot allow the United States to illegally and unreasonably erase the goals of the war against Japan, illegally tear up the solemn provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation on Japanese politics, and absolutely cannot allow Japanese fascist militarism to revive, let the American and Japanese reactionaries oppress Japanese people's democracy, and collude with each other in acts of aggression, destroying peace in the Far East.
    According to the Potsdam Proclamation, the "authority" that led Japan's foreign aggression should be eliminated. What is "authority"? There is no other explanation, "authority" is Hirohito and his emperor system.
    In law, Article 1 of the former Japanese Constitution states: "The Empire of Japan shall be reigned over and governed by a line of Emperors unbroken for ages eternal." The Emperor is the supreme ruler. Article 3: "The Emperor is sacred and inviolable." He has both political and religious authority. Of course, actual politics are responsible. The declaration of war against the United States and Britain was an edict issued by Emperor Hirohito, and military actions and major decisions to invade China were approved by him. According to Konoe's diary: Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Emperor Hirohito asked at an Imperial Conference: "If war breaks out between Japan and the United States, is the Army confident that it can end it within a certain period?" What Konoe "felt most distressed..." was: "...the issue of supreme command, the government has no say, and the only one who can simultaneously restrain both the government and the supreme command is His Majesty. However, His Majesty..." These words prove that Hirohito did not oppose going to war against the United States and Britain. At the Imperial Conference on August 9, 1945, he decided to end the war, and on August 14, he decided to accept the Potsdam Proclamation. Emperor Hirohito was not only the authority for starting the war, but also the authority for surrendering.
    Hirohito cannot escape responsibility for the war of aggression. He should be a Class A top war criminal, and also the number one germ warfare criminal who violated humanity as proposed by the Soviet Union on February 1, 1950. The American draft treaty with Japan does not mention Emperor Hirohito and his emperor system at all. The status of Hirohito and his emperor system has been determined in the Japanese new constitution (implemented from May 1, 1947) under American instructions.
    Article 1 of the new constitution stipulates: "The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power." Since he is both a "symbol" and the "will of the people," these two words determine that the emperor's power to rule Japan has already obtained a legitimate status by "the people expressing their will." According to Article 3 of the new constitution: "All acts of the Emperor in matters of state shall require the advice and approval of the Cabinet, which shall be responsible therefor." This "advice" is equivalent to "memorials" or "censorship," so it can be said that Japan's "authority" is still represented by the emperor system as its center (of course, this sovereignty is under the command of the United States).
    Furthermore, Japan's philosophy of aggression, the spiritual foundation of Japanism, is centered on the emperor. Internally, Japanism views Japan as a family, with the emperor as the head of the family. Externally, it developed from Asianism to the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the military, it became the "Hakko Ichiu" (all the world under one roof) Kodoha faction. From Marshal Uehara to Araki, Masaki, and Yanagawa, these young officers all touted themselves as Kodoha. This is the Japanese version of fascism. All mystical powers take the feudal emperor as authority. This kind of authority is the spiritual source of aggression. In the eyes of the ruling class, it is even more important than the country. According to Kido's diary, when Tojo stepped down, Konoe said at a meeting of senior statesmen: "I think a left-wing revolution is more dangerous than defeat. Defeat can still maintain the imperial family and the national polity, but revolution cannot." The so-called imperial family and national polity is the emperor system. Preserving the emperor's importance outweighs everything. And now, the United States has preserved the emperor system for defeated Japan, sheltering the number one war criminal Hirohito, playing with this "second emperor," and using the emperor and the emperor system as a tool to revive Japanese militarism to invade Asia.
    According to the Potsdam Proclamation, the "influence" that led Japan's foreign aggression should be eliminated. What is the "influence" of aggression? The influence of aggression includes the military, the financial groups, and all fascist organizations.
    The Japanese Army and Navy military departments are of course a kind of aggressive "influence." Although this influence has been defeated, its remaining forces are still active everywhere in Japan. The United States not only allows their existence, but also provides direct and indirect encouragement and support. Former Japanese soldiers have risen again in Japan's rearmament and have become the darlings of the United States. Ugaki Kazushige's cabinet formation was almost called out; Nemoto Hiroshi loudly recruited volunteer soldiers for Chiang Kai-shek; Kawabe Torashiro set up an office in the Kyobashi Meiji Building in Tokyo to plan the establishment of the "Japan Defense Force"; the National Police Reserve and the Maritime Safety Agency have openly become the main base for former Japanese Army and Navy soldiers; all of this shows that the remaining forces of Japanese warlords have not been eliminated, and this is an aggressive "influence" that must be "eliminated."
    The zaibatsu were also a kind of "influence" that led aggression in the past. The "world" fought by the warlords was ultimately obtained by the zaibatsu. For example, the Kwantung Army of Honjo Shigeru invaded "Manchuria," and in the end, it was Ayukawa Yoshisuke's Manchuria Heavy Industries Development Corporation that got "Manchuria." At that time, these zaibatsu were called "pro-military zaibatsu." In addition to Ayukawa Yoshisuke's Japan Industries Corporation, their groups also included Mori Nobuteru's steel industry, Noguchi Jun's chemical industry, Nakajima Chikuhei's aircraft factory industry, and Ishihara Hiroichiro, who moved south. They all directly and indirectly managed the business of selling "dead people" and became rich through military procurement booms. They not only supported but also instigated the warlords to launch wars. The so-called old zaibatsu, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Okura, all actively participated in military production after the "September 18th" Incident. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which manufactured aircraft, warships, and tanks, was Japan's largest military industry, and its power overwhelmed any emerging zaibatsu. Mitsui could also be compared. Sumitomo's steelmaking, aluminum refining, and chemical industries served the military and were well-known. Okura was originally an arms dealer. Asano Shipbuilding, ironmaking, and chemical industries all had magnificent power. The old and new zaibatsu were the original "forces" of aggression.
    These Japanese big zaibatsu did not receive the punishment they deserved after the war. Not a single Japanese zaibatsu was listed as a Class A war criminal for trial. On the contrary, they were protected by the United States, followed the United States in its frantic preparations for war, and were again developing war industries to sell dead people. These big zaibatsu colluded with the American ruling class and have basically become American compradors. Japan's war industry has basically become an industry subordinate to the United States. Therefore, the American draft treaty with Japan does not mention the dissolution of the Japanese zaibatsu at all.
    Japanese fascist organizations are complex and diverse. The military and zaibatsu are of course a face of fascism, but there are also many groups that purely appear with fascist theories and actions and call for this, constituting a part of the aggressive forces. All fascist groups carry feudal mysticism, such as the "Aikokusha," "Shimpūren," "Blood Pledge Corps," "May 15th" and even the "February 26th" Incident, all of which are weird and full of feudal colors. These bizarre so-called "civilian" fascist groups combined with the military, propagandized and carried out foreign aggression. When Japan surrendered, it organized one hundred groups, large groups with more than 10,000 people, went underground, and developed organizations. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the general election in 1946, many fascist groups appeared. Such as Kodama Yoshio's Japan Nationalist Party, Sasakawa Ryoichi's National Labor League and Constitutional Youth Party, as well as the Autonomous Kōminkai, the Kōmin Front Council, and the Emperor System Support Alliance, etc. Their election slogan was consistent: "Absolutely support the emperor system." At the end of 1947, these fascist organizations, led by the Salvation National Justice Party, jointly formed the National Anti-Communist Organization Council. According to a survey by the Japanese Police Agency, there were 250 "right-wing groups" in Tokyo alone, and the total number in the country was 1,620. Famous fascist leaders such as Tachibana Kōzaburō and Inoue Nisshō still have great influence in Japan. The North Japan Youth Party, the Peasant Party, the Chrysanthemum Flag Comrades Association and various new fascist groups, under the incubation and encouragement of American imperialism, run rampant and do whatever they want.
    The American draft treaty with Japan does not mention a single word about banning fascist organizations.
    Another provision of the Potsdam Proclamation is that obstacles to democracy should be eliminated so that the Japanese people can "freely express their will" and "establish a government inclined to peace and responsibility." The so-called "obstacles" are, first of all, the bureaucrats who share responsibility for the war of aggression with other reactionary forces. Japanese military man Tanaka Ryukichi wrote a book exposing the inside story of Japan and said: "The officials who should be public servants of the people have become militarized, and they are as afraid of the military as tigers. However, almost all of the economic power that dominates the lives of the people is in the hands of the militarized bureaucrats." The so-called militarization of bureaucrats mainly means that Japan's huge bureaucratic institutions were all serving the war of aggression. It organized and supported the war of aggression, carried out the task of governing, and suppressed the people at home. After the war, some bureaucrats were listed for "purge" (most were omitted) and were not allowed to participate in official activities, but the so-called "purge" was lifted batch after batch. These sinful bureaucratic elements have become American imperialist running dogs who rule Japan and still occupy important positions in the Japanese regime, wielding power and doing whatever they want.
    One of the positive provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation is to ensure that the Japanese people have basic freedoms and human rights. The current situation in Japan is completely opposite to this. The American and Japanese reactionaries have completely deprived the Japanese people of their basic freedoms and human rights. The right of workers to strike has been deprived, gatherings, parades and demonstrations have been prohibited, and all democratic publications have been banned; freedom of speech has been suppressed; progressives have been purged from enterprises, government agencies and schools on the grounds of ideological problems; patriots who oppose the war have been subjected to American military trials; the democratic groups of Korean people in Japan have been dissolved; twenty-four central committee members of the Japanese Communist Party have been "purged"; in the recent measures to suppress the "Voice of Peace," seven hundred Japanese Communist Party members and patriots have been illegally arrested; the headquarters of the "Japan National Trade Union Liaison Council," which participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions, has been dissolved; when the masses in Tokyo held anti-war and independence demonstrations on May 30, 1950, they groundlessly used the excuse of beating American military police to sentence eight patriotic youths to ten years and less of hard labor. The most cruel thing is that in August 1949, in order to suppress the national railway workers who were in struggle at that time, the American occupation forces instigated a train derailment and arrested twenty Japanese Communist Party members and patriotic workers, which is the so-called "Matsukawa Incident." At the end of 1950, the colonial court in Japan sentenced five innocent people in the Matsukawa Incident to death, five to life imprisonment, and the other ten to a total of ninety-five and a half years of imprisonment.
    This series of facts tells us how cruelly American imperialists are suppressing Japanese people's democracy and depriving them of their basic rights. The American draft treaty with Japan does not have positive and effective provisions to protect the democratic rights of the Japanese people. This is a chain that American imperialism consciously put on the heads of the Japanese people.
    The second positive provision of the Potsdam Proclamation is to "establish a peaceful and responsible government in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people." The current situation in Japan is completely opposite to this. The Japanese people do not have the right to "freely express their will" at all, and the Japanese reactionary government is not a "peaceful and responsible" government. Every election is conducted under coercion and inducement. The American and Japanese reactionaries have repeatedly said publicly: "Whoever votes for the Communist Party will have their rice rations canceled." In order to eat, the Japanese people are forced to give up their right to freely express their will. The post-war Japanese cabinets produced on this basis are in fact equivalent to being ordered and appointed by the United States. The power changes back and forth, and it all falls into the hands of pro-American Japanese comprador bureaucrats. The current cabinet headed by Yoshida Shigeru is completely a running dog of the United States. This cabinet is working day and night to rearm Japan and openly expresses its support for the American aggression against Korea. It has no possibility of being "inclined to peace" at all, and it cannot "be responsible" to the Potsdam Proclamation and the Japanese people at all.
    This blank chapter of the American draft treaty with Japan contains various vicious conspiracies as described above, and deliberately omits its conspiracies from the clauses. What a punishable intention this is, what a despicable and dirty trick!
    The Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of other ethnic groups in Asia should unite, tear up this American draft treaty with Japan, drive out the American aggressors, eliminate the comprador and residual Japanese fascist militarism, give the Japanese nation independence and people's democracy, realize the goals of the war against Japan, and defend lasting peace in the Far East!

　　没有政治条款
    ——美制对日和约草案空白的一章
    李纯青
    战争是政治的延续，结束战争的和约应贯彻作战的目的。对日战争最大的目的之一，在打倒日本法西斯军国主义，给日本人民以民主自由。这一目的，在波茨坦公告中曾明白规定，应付实施，不容美国任意歪曲或抹煞。
    波茨坦公告第六条规定：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，必须永久剔除。盖吾人坚持非将负责之穷兵黩武主义驱出世界，则和平安全及正义的新秩序，势不可能建立。”第十条又规定：“日本政府必须把阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及加强的所有障碍予以消除，言论、宗教与思想自由，以及对基本人权的重视必须成立。”第十二条规定：“依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府………”。根据这三条规定，在消极方面，应消除：１．领导侵略的“威权”，２．领导侵略的“势力”，３．“民主的障碍”。在积极方面，应保证：１．“日本人民的基本自由与人权”，２．依据人民民主产生一“和平倾向及负责之政府”；以消除日本军国主义，保障远东和平。
    这些目标应规定在和约之中，对意大利和约便是如此规定的。该约第十五条规定：“意大利应采取必要之措施，保证意大利统治下之全体人民，不分种族、性别、语言、宗教，均得享受人权及基本自由（包括言论自由、出版自由、信仰自由、及政治结社自由）。”这是积极一面的规定。该约第十七条：“依照停战协定第三条之规定，意大利已实际解散意大利之法西斯蒂党组织，并同意嗣后如有类似政治、军事或半军事之团体组织，而其目的在剥削人民之民主权利者，在意大利复活时，应加以禁止。”这是消极一面的规定。
    美制对日和约草案应有的政治条款则是空白的一章。虽在序文上有极简单的几句，即：“愿按照联合国宪章第五十五条及第五十六条之规定，在其国内建立安定与幸福的条件，此点由日本战后立法已开始实现。”这几句含糊其词，既非政治条款，更无法律的拘束力。
    按联合国宪章第五十五条和第五十六条乃属“国际经济及社会合作”的范围，所谓“安定与幸福的条件”是空泛的，纲领性的。第五十五条虽列出三项宗旨，末了一项为：“全体人类之人权及基本自由之普遍遵守与尊重，不分种族、性别、语言或宗教。”但联合国对各会员国，只能“促进”，不能强迫施行。因此美制对日和约草案序文所载，对日本并无强迫性，并无法律权力，日本可以不尊重人权及基本自由，可以任意复活法西斯政治而无所禁忌。再说，美国的联合国丧尽了国际道义的尊严，歪曲了和平民主的意义，当然不会给日本反动派为难，不会去“促进”与美国利益相违反的日本的真正民主。
    即使如此，序文中在刚刚说出了一线光明之后，又立即为“此点由日本战后立法已开始实现”所抹煞了。就是说，日本在战后立法中，已实现了“安全与幸福条件”，一切都很民主，对日作战同盟国在和约中对战败国日本的政治不应再有所要求了。
    对日作战的同盟国，特别是中国和苏联，绝对不能容许美国这样非法无理地抹煞对日作战目的，非法撕毁波茨坦公告对日本政治的庄严规定，绝对不能容许日本法西斯军国主义复活，让美日反动派压迫日本人民民主，及在侵略行为上互相勾结，破坏远东和平。
    根据波茨坦公告规定，应剔除领导日本对外侵略的“威权”。什么是“威权”？没有第二个解释，“威权”就是裕仁及其天皇制。
    在法律上，旧日本宪法第一条：“大日本帝国，由万世一系的天皇统治之。”天皇是最高统治者。第三条：“天皇神圣不可侵犯。”他兼有政治与宗教的权威。实际政治当然负责。对美英宣战是裕仁天皇颁布的诏书，侵略中国的军事行动及重大决策，都经他裁可。据近卫日记载：太平洋大战爆发前，裕仁天皇在御前会议曾问：“若日美战事发生，陆军确信若干期间可以结束？”近卫所“最感痛心……”的是：“……统帅权问题，政府毫无发言权，而能同时抑制政府与统帅部双方者，惟陛下一人。然而陛下……”从这些话中证明裕仁并未反对对美英开战。一九四五年八月九日御前会议，他决定结束战争，八月十四日又决定接受波茨坦公告。裕仁天皇不但是开战的威权，也是投降的威权。
    裕仁是不能逃避侵略战争的责任的，他应该是甲级头号战犯，又是一九五○年二月一日苏联所提出的违反人道的第一名细菌战犯。美制对日和约草案对日皇裕仁及其天皇制一字不提，裕仁及其天皇制的地位概在美国指令的日本新宪法（一九四七年五月一日起实行）中早予确定了。
    新宪法第一条规定：“天皇为日本国之象征，日本国民统合之象征。其地位，基于主权所存之国民之总意。”既是“象征”，又是“国民之总意”，用这两个字眼，确定天皇统治日本的皇权，已经“人民表示意志”，取得合法的地位。根据新宪法第三条：“天皇关于国事的行为，必要承认内阁之助言，内阁负其责任。”这个“助言”等于“奏议”或“台谏”，因此可以说日本的“威权”仍是以天皇制度为其集中的代表（当然，这主权是归美国指挥的）。
    再说，日本的侵略哲学，日本主义的精神基础，是以天皇为中心的。日本主义对内以日本为一个家庭，天皇是家长。对外则由亚细亚主义发展为东亚协同体。在军部，就成了“八紘一宇”的皇道派，由上原元帅以迄荒木、真崎、柳川，这些少壮军人都自诩为皇道派。这就是法西斯主义的日本版。一切神秘力量，都以封建的天皇为威权。这种威权即侵略的精神根源，在统治阶级看来，甚至比国家还重要。据木户日记写东条下台，近卫在重臣会议席上说：“我以为左翼革命，比战败还要危险。战败尚可保持皇室国体，革命则不然。”所谓皇室国体就是天皇制。保存天皇的重要性超过一切。而现在，美国已给战败了的日本保存了天皇制，庇护着头号战犯裕仁，玩弄着这个“二皇帝”，利用天皇及天皇制，做为复兴日本军国主义以侵略亚洲的工具。
    根据波茨坦公告规定，应剔除领导日本对外侵略的“势力”，什么是侵略的“势力”呢？侵略势力是包括军部、财阀及一切法西斯组织而言。
    日本陆海军军部当然是一种侵略“势力”，这种势力虽已被打倒，其残余力量仍在日本国内到处活跃，美国对他们不但允许其存在，且加以直接间接的鼓励与扶植。日本旧军人在日本再武装中纷纷再起，已成为美国的宠儿。宇垣一成的组阁曾呼之欲出；根本博曾大张旗鼓为蒋介石招募义勇军；河边虎四郎在东京京桥明治大厦设立办事处，筹划建立“日本防卫军”；国家警察预备队和海上保安厅公开成为日本旧陆海军军人的大本营；这一切，都说明了日本军阀残余势力尚未消灭，这是必须“剔除”的一种侵略“势力”。
    财阀也是过去领导侵略的一种“势力”。军阀打的“天下”，终为财阀所得。例如本庄繁的关东军侵入“满洲”，最后则是鲇川义介的满洲重工业会社得了“满洲”。当时这类财阀叫“亲军财阀”，其集团，除鲇川义介的日本产业会社外，尚有森矗昶的炼钢业，野口遵的化学工业，中岛知久平的飞机工厂产业，南进的石原广一郎等，都直接间接经营着贩卖“死人”的事业，无不以军需景气而致暴富，他们不仅支持而且教唆着军阀发动战争。所谓旧财阀，如三井、三菱、住友、太仓等，“九一八”以后，也都积极地参加军事生产了。三菱重工业制造飞机、军舰、坦克，是日本最大的军需工业，其力量压倒任何新兴财阀。三井也可媲美。住友的炼钢、炼铝及化学工业，为军事服务，都十分著称。大仓则本是军火商人。浅野造船、炼铁、化学工业均有雄伟的力量。新旧财阀是侵略的原始“势力”。
    战后这些日本大财阀没有得到应得的惩处，日本财阀没有一个列入甲级战犯受审判，相反的却受着美国的庇护，追随美国疯狂的备战，又在发展贩卖死人的战争工业了。这些大财阀与美国统治阶级互相勾结，基本上已经变成美国的买办，日本的战争工业基本上已经变成美国的附属的工业，故美制对日和约草案对于解散日本财阀根本不提。
    日本法西斯组织是复杂多样的，军部财阀当然是法西斯的一种面目，但更有许多团体纯然以法西斯理论与行动出现并以此号召，构成了侵略势力之一部。一切法西斯团体，都带着封建的神秘主义，像“爱乡塾”、“神兵队”、“血盟团”、“五一五”以至“二二六”事件，无不阴阳怪气，充满了封建色彩。这些光怪陆离的所谓“民间的”法西斯团体，与军部结合，宣传并进行对外侵略。日本法西斯在投降时曾组织了一百个团体，一万人以上的大集团，潜入地下，发展组织。一九四六年乘大选的机会，便有许多法西斯团体出现。如儿玉誉士夫系的日本国民党，笹川良一系的全国勤劳者同盟和立宪青年党，以及自治皇民会、皇民战线协议会、天皇制奉护同盟等等，其选举的口号是一致的：即“绝对拥护天皇制”。一九四七年年底，这些法西斯组织，由救国立正党领导，联合组成了全国反共团体协议会。据日本警察厅调查，仅在东京一地便有二百五十个“右翼团体”，全国总数为一千六百二十个。著名的法西斯头子，如橘孝三郎、井上日昭等仍然在日本拥有莫大势力。北日本青年党、农民党、菊旗同志会各种新的法西斯团体，在美帝孵育鼓励之下，横行霸道，为所欲为。
    美制对日和约草案，没有一字提到禁止法西斯组织。
    波茨坦公告另一规定为应消除民主障碍，使日本人民得以“自由表达意志”“建立倾向和平及负责的政府”，所谓“障碍”，首推与其他反动势力共负侵略战争责任的官僚。日本军阀田中隆吉写一本暴露日本内幕的书说：“应作人民公仆的官吏，变成了军属化，他们对军部，怕得像老虎一样。但是，几乎支配国民生活全部的经济实权，都操在军属化的官僚手里。”所谓官僚军属化，主要意义是日本政治庞大的官僚机构，都在为侵略战争服役，它组织并支持侵略战争，执行统治任务，镇压国内人民。战后有些官僚曾被列名加以“整肃”（多数则被遗漏了），不得参加公务活动，但所谓“整肃”，不久便一批一批地陆续解除。这些罪恶的官僚分子，已变成美帝国主义统治日本的走狗，仍然在日本政权占据要津，作威作福。
    波茨坦公告积极方面的规定之一，是要保证日本人民获有基本自由与人权。日本现状与此完全相反，美日反动派完全剥夺了日本人民的基本自由与人权。工人的罢工权利被剥夺，集会游行示威被禁止，所有民主的出版物都被禁止发行；镇压言论；以思想问题为理由从企业、政府机关和学校整肃进步分子；反对战争的爱国者受到美国的军事裁判；旅日朝鲜人民的各民主团体被解散；“整肃”日本共产党二十四名中央委员；在不久前镇压“和平之声”的措施中，更有七百个日共党员和爱国者被非法逮捕；参加世界工联的“日本全国工会联络协议会”总部被解散；一九五○年五月三十日东京群众举行反战与要求独立的游行示威时，竟毫无根据地以殴打美国宪兵为借口，对八名爱国青年处以十年及十年以下的苦役。最残酷的是一九四九年八月为镇压当时在斗争中的国家铁路工人，美占领军指使制造了火车出轨事件逮捕了二十名日本共产党员与爱国工人，这就是所谓“松川事件”，一九五○年年底，日本的殖民地的审判判处松川事件的五名无辜者以死刑，五名无期徒刑，其他十人被判处总计九十五年半的有期徒刑。
    这一连串的事实，告诉我们美国帝国主义者在如何残酷地镇压日本人民民主与剥夺日本人民的基本权利，美制对日和约草案，没有保障日本人民民主权利的积极有效规定，这是美帝国主义有意识地套在日本人民头上的锁链。
    波茨坦公告积极方面的规定之二，是要“依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一和平倾向及负责之政府”。日本现状与此完全相反，日本人民根本没有“自由表示意志”的权利，日本反动政府更不是一个“和平倾向及负责”的政府。每次选举都在威迫利诱下进行，美日反动派一再公开说：“谁选举共产党，谁就将被取消米的配给”。日本人民为了吃饭，被迫放弃自由表示意志的权利，在这基础上所产生的战后历届日本内阁，事实上等于由美国命令指派，政权转来转去，无不落在亲美的日本买办官僚手中。以吉田茂为首的现任内阁，就完全是美国的走狗，这个内阁正在日夜进行日本再武装的工作，公开表示援助美国侵略朝鲜。它丝毫没有“和平倾向”的可能，它丝毫不能对波茨坦公告及对日本人民“负责”。
    美制对日和约草案这空白的一章，包含了如上所述各种毒辣阴谋，故意将其阴谋遗漏在条文之外，这是何等可诛的居心，何种卑鄙恶浊的诡计！
    中国人民、日本人民、亚洲其他各族人民应团结起来，撕毁这个美制对日和约草案，赶走美国侵略者，剔除买办的、残余的日本法西斯军国主义，给日本民族以独立与人民民主，实现对日战争的目的，保卫远东持久和平！
