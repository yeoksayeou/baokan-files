　　Purge the Imperialist Elements Within the Catholic Church!
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing dispatch: Our special correspondent Ji Yin reports: After letters from the Monaco national and imperialist element Archbishop Riberi, blatantly interfering in the patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics, were disclosed in local newspapers here, patriotic Catholics throughout the city expressed their intolerance for the tyrannical behavior of this running dog of American imperialism. Li Weiguang, acting bishop of the Nanjing Catholic Diocese, Wang Xingtian, chief priest of the Shigu Road Catholic Church in Nanjing, and more than 80 others gathered on the evening of the 25th to unanimously protest Riberi's crimes of undermining the patriotic movement of the Catholic Church. Catholics from many units, including Nanjing University, Private Hongguang Middle School, and the Midwifery School, also gathered to demand that the government expel this imperialist element from the country. Patriotic Catholics also exposed many of Riberi's past evil deeds of interfering in our country's internal affairs.
　　The Catholic Three-Self Reform Movement Promotion Association of Private Hongguang Middle School issued a written statement exposing that Riberi, at the end of 1950, openly slandered the just struggle of patriotic students in the city against American imperialist elements, such as American professors Reh T. Anh and Lin Charlie of Jinling University, in front of the students of Hongguang Middle School, and that he manipulated American teachers and Catholic priests, such as Bao Qinghua and Du Hua, behind the scenes to carry out anti-Chinese people activities in Hongguang Middle School. The association called on patriotic Catholics across the country to unite and purge the imperialist elements within the Catholic Church. Luo Shuqin, a Catholic student at the Midwifery School, revealed that before the liberation of Kaifeng, Riberi promoted the Italian priest Yang Lin three levels in a row, against the opposition of the parishioners, and made him the bishop of the district, in order to arrange espionage activities. Catholics in Nanjing unanimously pointed out that the Riberi incident proves that imperialism is doing its utmost to undermine the patriotic reform movement of our country's churches, and we must be vigilant.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 25th: The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association sent a letter to the patriotic Catholics in Nanjing on the 24th, supporting their just struggle against the imperialist element Riberi.
　　The full text of the letter is as follows:
　　To the patriotic Catholic priests and parishioners of the Nanjing Diocese:
　　Today we saw the declaration you jointly issued on March 31st. This is another severe blow to the imperialists by our awakened Chinese Catholics. We hope that you will continue to work harder and fight more bravely against the imperialists, completely eliminate their power and influence from our Catholic Church, and completely return the sovereignty of our Chinese Catholic Church to the hands of us Chinese people.
　　At the same time as seeing this patriotic declaration, we also saw the letter from Riberi, the running dog of American imperialism, to the bishops of various Catholic regions in China. This letter proves that Riberi is an enemy of the Chinese people, and also proves once again the crimes of imperialists using Catholicism to invade China and the Roman Curia interfering in China's internal affairs. This letter aroused our extreme indignation. Riberi still wants to issue orders now, demanding that we—Chinese bishops, priests, and parishioners—be enemies of the entire people. This is an insult to Chinese Catholics, and we absolutely cannot tolerate it!
　　Now, in addition to being willing to fully support your patriotic and religious actions, and representing the 15,000 Catholics in Tianjin to express our cordial greetings to you, we also ask the People's Government to deal strictly with this running dog of American imperialism according to law.
　　　　　　　　　　Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association

　　[Our Newspaper] Regarding the illegal behavior of the imperialist element Riberi in undermining the reform movement of Catholics in Nanjing, many readers of this newspaper have written letters expressing their demand that the government expel him from the country according to law. Zeng Kang, a student at Beijing Normal University and a Catholic, wrote a letter denouncing Riberi's conspiracy to undermine the Catholic reform movement. He said: Church rules clearly stipulate that Catholics should love their country, but Riberi insisted on describing the active actions of Chinese patriotic Catholics, priests, and parishioners as being caught in the "enemy's tricks." Conscientious Catholics, can we tolerate him continuing to stay in the church? Catholics across the country should take active action to expose and thoroughly eliminate all imperialist elements. The letter from all the students and staff of the Workers' School of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions said: This imperialist element, who once praised Chiang Kai-shek's "meritorious deeds" of killing people, is now conspiring to undermine the patriotic movement of the Chinese people, and his consistent anti-people crimes are beyond doubt. We demand that the government deal with Riberi's crimes according to law. Readers Yu Zuomin and Yang Hanmin also firmly demanded in their letters that the government expel the American imperialist running dog Riberi. Letters from Tian He of the Second Division of the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University, Shao Tianren of the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and Wang Xiaozong of Beijing Department Store all condemned Riberi's crimes and demanded that the government take effective measures.

　　肃清天主教内的帝国主义分子！
    南京天主教徒揭露黎培里罪行
    天津天主教徒致函支持南京教徒的正义斗争
    北京人民要求政府依法将其驱逐出境
    【本报南京专电】本报特约记者季音报道：居住在南京的摩纳哥侨民、帝国主义分子黎培里公然干涉中国天主教徒爱国运动的信件在此间报端披露后，全市爱国天主教徒对于这个美帝国主义走狗的横暴行为表示不能容忍。天主教南京教区代理主教李维光、南京石鼓路天主堂总司铎王性天等八十余人于二十五日晚集会，一致抗议黎培里破坏天主教爱国运动的罪行。南京大学、私立弘光中学、助产学校等许多单位的天主教徒，也都纷纷集会，要求政府把这个帝国主义分子驱逐出境。爱国的天主教徒并揭露了黎培里一贯干涉我国内政的许多罪恶事实。
    私立弘光中学天主教三自革新运动促进会为此发表书面意见，揭露了黎培里在一九五零年年底，曾公开在弘光中学学生面前，诬蔑全市爱国学生在对美帝国主义分子金陵大学美籍教授芮陶庵、林查理等进行的正义斗争，以及其在幕后操纵该校美籍教师天主教神父包清华、杜华等在弘光中学进行反中国人民的活动的罪行。该会号召全国爱国教徒团结起来，肃清天主教会内的帝国主义分子。助产学校学生天主教徒罗叔琴揭露出黎培里在开封解放前为布置间谍活动，不顾教友的反对竟将意籍神父阳霖连升三级，提为该区主教。南京天主教徒一致指出，黎培里事件证明帝国主义对于我国教会的爱国革新运动正在竭力进行破坏，必须提高警惕。
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津市天主教革新运动促进会于二十四日致函南京市爱国的天主教徒，支持他们对帝国主义分子黎培里的正义斗争。
    该函全文如下：南京教区爱国的天主教神长教友们：
    我们在今天见到了你们在三月三十一日联合发表的宣言，这是我们觉悟了的中国教友再一次给予帝国主义者的严重的打击。我们希望你们再接再厉地更勇敢地向帝国主义者斗争，把他们的势力和影响从我们的天主教会中彻底地清除出去，使我们中国天主教教会的主权完全回到我们中国人的手里。
    在看到这个爱国宣言的同时，我们也看到了美帝国主义的走狗黎培里给中国天主教各区主教的信。这封信证明了黎培里是中国人民的敌人，也又一次证明了帝国主义者利用天主教侵略中国和罗马教廷干涉中国内政的罪行。这封信引起了我们的极度愤恨。黎培里居然在现在还想发号施令，要我们——中国主教、神甫和教友们——与全体人民为敌。这是对中国天主教徒的污辱，我们绝对不能容忍！
    现在我们除了愿意全力支持你们的爱国爱教的行动，并代表天津市的一万五千名教友向你们致亲切的慰问外，我们并要求人民政府对这个美帝国主义的走狗黎培里依法严加处理。
                  天津市天主教革新运动促进会
    【本报讯】对帝国主义分子黎培里破坏南京天主教徒革新运动的非法行为，本报许多读者纷纷来信表示，要求政府依法将其驱逐出境。北京师范大学学生、天主教教徒曾康写信痛斥黎培里阴谋破坏天主教革新运动的罪行。他说：教规明明规定教友要爱国，而黎培里硬把中国爱国教友与神长们的积极行动，说成是中了“敌人的诡计”。有良心的教友们，我们能容忍他在教会里继续停留吗？全国教友应积极行动起来，检举和彻底肃清一切帝国主义分子。北京市总工会职工学校全体学员和工作人员的来信说：这个曾经歌颂蒋匪介石杀人“功德”的帝国主义分子，今天又阴谋破坏中国人民的爱国运动，其一贯反人民的罪行已不容置疑。我们要求政府依法处理黎培里的罪行。读者余作民、杨汉民在信中，也坚决要求政府驱逐美帝国主义走狗黎培里。北京师范大学附属中学二部田禾、重工业部化学工业局邵天仁、北京市百货公司王孝宗等的信中，均同声痛斥黎培里的罪行，要求政府采取有效措施。
