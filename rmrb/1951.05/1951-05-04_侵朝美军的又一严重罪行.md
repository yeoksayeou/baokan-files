　　Another Serious Crime of the American Invading Army in Korea
    The American invading army in Korea, which has repeatedly committed heinous crimes against the Chinese and Korean people and their people's forces, recently committed another act of inhumane cruelty in the port of Wonsan, Korea, on a ship disguised as a "disease prevention" vessel. They conducted experiments with bacterial weapons on captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world are extremely outraged by this. The aggressors' inhuman and beastly crimes must be subjected to the most severe sanctions by the people of the world.
    The American invading army in Korea has repeatedly violated humanitarian principles and international law, cruelly harming Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers fighting for peace on the Korean battlefield. At 4:00 PM on December 1st last year, troops belonging to the American invading army collectively shot and killed 31 captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel and 35 peaceful Korean residents in Jungseo-ri, Gacheon County, South Pyongan Province, Korea. On February 23rd, February 26th, and March 3rd of this year, the American invading army continuously used asphyxiating poisonous gas bombs and shells four times on the Han River front, attempting to poison our People's Volunteer Army soldiers. Now, the crimes committed by the American invaders are even more brutal, as they are actually conducting cruel experiments with bacterial weapons on captured personnel of our People's Volunteer Army. This heinous and bloodthirsty crime once again proves that the American invaders are completely devoid of humanity, and are nothing more than beasts.
    Bacterial weapons are strictly prohibited by civilized humanity, but the American invaders not only openly manufacture them, but also conduct inhumane experiments. The Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world must not tolerate such crimes, and must take more resolute action to eliminate the American invaders and all their evil conspiracies as soon as possible.
    Human civilization is solemn and inviolable. The American war criminals who manufacture bacterial weapons and conduct cruel experiments with them must be tried for war crimes in the fair court of the people of the world, and must be subjected to the most severe punishment by humanity.

　　侵朝美军的又一严重罪行
    对中朝人民及人民部队屡次犯下滔天罪行的侵朝美军，最近竟又在朝鲜元山港的一艘以“防疫”为名的船上，灭绝人性地以中国人民志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验。中国人民与世界爱好和平人民对此无比震怒。侵略者的惨无人道的兽性罪行，是一定要受到世界人民最严厉制裁的。
    侵朝美军曾一再违反人道与国际公法，在朝鲜战场上残害我为和平而战的中国人民战士。去年十二月一日午后四时，美国侵略军所属部队在朝鲜平安南道价川郡中西里曾以机枪将三十一名中国人民志愿军的被俘人员和朝鲜三十五名和平居民集体枪杀。今年二月二十三日、二十六日、三月三日，美国侵略军曾连续四次在汉江前线使用窒息性毒气炸弹与炮弹，妄图毒害我人民志愿军战士。如今，美国侵略者所犯的罪行更为残暴，竟以我人民志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的残酷实验。这种罪大恶极的嗜血罪行，再度证明了美国侵略者是完全灭绝了人性的野兽。
    细菌武器是文明人类所严禁使用的，而美国侵略者不但公然进行制造，甚至还在作着惨无人道的实验。中国人民和世界爱好和平人民绝不能容忍这种罪行，必须要以更坚决的行动来早日将美国侵略者及其一切罪恶阴谋彻底消灭干净。
    人类文明是庄严不可侵犯的。制造细菌武器及以细菌武器作残酷实验的美国战犯们，是一定要在世界人民的公正法庭上受战罪审判，并且一定要受到人类最严厉的处罚。
