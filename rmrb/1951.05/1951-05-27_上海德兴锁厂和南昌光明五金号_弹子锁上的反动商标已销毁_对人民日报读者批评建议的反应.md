To the Editors:
    We are very grateful for the criticism from Comrade Huang Hai regarding the use of old trademarks on the tumbler locks we sell, as published in the "Reader's Letters" section of your newspaper on May 9th. That trademark was used by us before liberation. After liberation, because we had a large amount of old stock, we declared to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the trade association that we would temporarily continue to use the old, reactionary Kuomintang flag logo after covering it with a five-pointed star. Since March of this year, we have used up all of this trademark stock and have stopped using it.

    Therefore, we believe that the locks purchased by Comrade Huang Hai from Guangming Hardware Store in Nanchang City, produced by our factory, may be the store's pre-liberation stock.

To the Editors:
    The matter mentioned in the "Reader's Letters" section of your newspaper on May 9th by Comrade Huang Hai of the Suichuan County People's Government in Jiangxi Province, pointing out that the tumbler locks we sell bear a reactionary Kuomintang flag trademark, is true. The situation was caused by our carelessness. These locks were stock we purchased in 1949, and we still have sixteen locks remaining. To correct our carelessness and to show our acceptance of Comrade Huang Hai's criticism, we have destroyed all of the reactionary trademarks and trademark instructions. At the same time, we have reported this situation to the trade association, requesting them to inspect.

### 上海德兴锁厂和南昌光明五金号  弹子锁上的反动商标已销毁  对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　上海德兴锁厂和南昌光明五金号
    弹子锁上的反动商标已销毁
    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应编辑同志：
    五月九日贵报《读者来信专页》登载了黄海同志对我们销售的弹子锁上使用旧商标的批评，我们很感激。那个商标是我们在解放前使用的；解放后，我们因为旧存过多，曾向上海市人民政府及同业公会声明，将旧存反动的青天白日标志，加盖上五角星后暂时继续使用。自今年三月间，是项商标全部用完，已停止使用。
    因此我们认为，黄海同志从南昌市光明五金号所购本厂所出的锁，可能是该号解放前的存货。

    编辑同志：
    五月九日贵报《读者来信专页》所载：江西遂川县人民政府黄海同志指出我们销售的弹子锁上有反动的青天白日商标一事是事实。事情是由于我们的粗心大意造成的。这些锁是我们在一九四九年买进的存货，至今仍存有十六把。为纠正我们的粗心大意和表示接受黄海同志的批评，我们已把全部反动商标、商标说明书销毁。同时，我们还把这一情况报告给了同业公会，请他们检查。
