Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's Self-Criticism Regarding the Issue of People Buying and Selling Railway Materials
Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

Editor:

After reading Comrade Wu Xiang's article "Railway Materials Cannot Be Bought and Sold Casually" in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 16th, we deeply appreciate Comrade Wu Xiang's proactive and responsible attitude, and we sincerely accept the criticism.

Most of the situation reflected by Comrade Wu Xiang is true. In November of last year, the Wanping County People's Government contacted us, intending to transport the scrap iron stored by the masses to Beijing for sale. In order to prevent the destruction of useful equipment during the sale of scrap iron, it was decided that Wanping County would be responsible for organizing inspections before transporting it to Beijing, and then our bureau would be responsible for inspections and introductions for sale. On December 22nd, farmers An Guocai and others, holding certificates from the Wanping County People's Government, transported more than 2,400 kilograms of equipment. Among them were 377 large fishplates, and the rest were rusty small iron rails and iron picks, all less than four or five feet long. When transported through Qianmenwai, it was detained by the Dong Station Public Security Section. Comrade Xing Shuxiang of the Public Security Section called our bureau to inquire, and we replied, "The farmers in Wanping County transported and sold scrap iron, and the Wanping County People's Government contacted us in advance; if useful equipment is found during the inspection, we will be responsible for freezing it." The Public Security Section then released it. Afterwards, we introduced and sold this batch of large fishplates to the Materials Section of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration; they did not want the rest that was scrapped, so we introduced and sold it to the Jianguo Iron Factory.

After An Guocai and others transported and sold the large fishplates, and after we inspected the short iron rails and found that two sections were newly damaged, we immediately pointed out to the Wanping County People's Government that they had not conducted a strict inspection of the matter, and asked them to seriously carry out this work in the future, otherwise, please stop transporting and selling. They accepted this suggestion. However, while we were writing to the Wanping County People's Government, there were several more shipments. (Because the farmers had already bought the goods, some were in transit; the Wanping County People's Government approved the shipment to take care of the farmers.) After our inspection, they were all scrap iron.

After reading Comrade Wu Xiang's letter this time, we sent people to Wanping and Mentougou to understand the situation, contacted the railway department, and inspected the Jianguo Iron Factory. The factory purchased more than 25,000 kilograms of scrap iron rails, most of which were scrapped small iron rails, and a few were scrapped short large iron rails and other scrap iron. The railway department believes that there is one car door and seven sections of half-length large iron rails that can still be used. We have told the iron factory that when using potentially useful equipment, it must obtain the consent of the railway department; in the future, the purchase of waste equipment must have a certificate approved by the government for sale. What Comrade Wu Xiang said: "The Jianguo Iron Factory has more than two tons of car connecting rods, car door upright hook door iron, etc., and the Ministry of Railways exchanged it for two tons of scrap iron." This did happen; but it was before June of last year.

Our self-criticism is: After the Wanping County People's Government put forward the reasons and opinions for farmers to sell scrap iron, we did not consult with the railway department before agreeing to do so. This shows that our research and compliance with policies and regulations are insufficient, and we did not consider whether scrap equipment can be sold without the railway department? What is scrap equipment? Does the railway department collect scrapped equipment? At the same time, we promised to be responsible for the inspection, but in fact, some inspections were not strict enough. This is a bureaucratic work style in our work, which deserves our high vigilance and attention in the future.

　　北京市工商局关于群众买卖铁路器材问题的检讨
    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应编辑同志：
    读了四月十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏吴祥同志的《铁路器材不能随便买卖》一文后，我们对吴祥同志这种积极负责的态度深表赞同，我们诚恳地接受批评。
    吴祥同志反映的情况大部属实。去年十一月宛平县人民政府曾和我们联系，拟将群众所存的废铁运到北京出售。为了防止出售废铁时破坏有用器材，决定先由宛平县负责组织检查运到北京，然后由我局检查介绍出售。到十二月二十二日，农民安国才等持有宛平县人民政府证明，运来了二千四百多公斤器材。内有大夹板三百七十七块，其余都是四、五尺以下残短生锈的大小铁轨和铁钎子。运经前门外，被东车站公安段扣留。公安段邢书香同志来电话询问我局，我们答复他说：“宛平县农民运售废铁，事先宛平县人民政府和我们联系过；如果检查出有用器材，我们负责冻结。”公安段就放行了。事后我们就把这部分大夹板介绍卖给天津铁路管理局北京分局材料科；其余废了的他们不要，我们又介绍卖给建国铁工厂。
    在安国才等运售大夹板和我们检查出短小铁轨中有两截是新破坏的之后，当即向宛平县人民政府提出他们对这事检查不严，请他们以后认真地进行此项工作，否则就请停止运售。他们接受了这一建议。但在我们写信给宛平县人民政府的过程中，又运来几次。（因为农民已经买妥，有的运在中途；宛平县人民政府为照顾农民，核准运出。）经我们检查，都是废铁。
    这次读了吴祥同志的信后，我们就派人到宛平、门头沟了解情况，和铁道部门联系，并到建国铁工厂检查。该厂收购废铁轨共计二万五千余公斤，绝大部分是残废小铁轨，少数是残短大铁轨和其他废铁。铁道部门认为尚能使用的有车门一个，半截大铁轨七节。我们已告诉铁工厂：在使用可能有用的器材时，一定要征得铁道部门的同意；以后收购废器材一定要有政府核准出售的证明。吴祥同志所谈：“建国铁工厂存有车连杆，车门立柱钩门铁等两吨多，铁道部用两吨废铁换了。”确有此事；但这是去年六月以前的事情。
    我们的检讨是：宛平县人民政府提出农民出售废铁的理由和意见后，我们未与铁道部门商量，即同意这样做，这说明我们对政策法令的研究和遵守不够，没考虑到：废器材不经铁道部门是否可以出售？什么是废器材？废的器材铁道部门是否收集？同时我们既答应负责检查，但实际上有的检查不够严格。这是我们工作中的官僚主义作风，值得我们今后高度警惕与注意。
