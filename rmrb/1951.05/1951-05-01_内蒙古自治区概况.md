　　An overview of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on May 1, 1947. The region is located in northeastern China, bordering the Mongolian People's Republic to the north, Heilongjiang and Liaoxi provinces to the east, Rehe and Chahar provinces to the south, and Suiyuan province to the west. The total area of the region is approximately 600,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 2.3 million. The People's Government of the region governs six leagues: Xing'an, Hulun, Jirem, Ju Ud, Xilingol, and Chahar, totaling thirty-two banners, seven counties, and three league-administered cities. Below the banners (counties, cities) are the various levels of people's power such as Nutuk (districts), Gacha (villages), and Baga (hamlets). Most of the above levels of people's governments are elected by the People's Congress or the People's Representative Conference.
    In addition to the more than 800,000 Mongolian people in the autonomous region, there are also about 60,000 people from fraternal ethnic groups such as the Solon, Daur, Oroqen, Korean, Hui, Tungus, Buryat Mongolian, Xibe, and Yakut, with the remainder being Han Chinese people.
    The people of the autonomous region are mainly engaged in agricultural production, but animal husbandry is also well-developed. Xing'an and Jirem leagues are agricultural areas, Xilingol League is a nomadic area, Ju Ud and Chahar leagues are semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and Hulun League is an area where agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry intersect. Mongolian people mostly live in mixed communities with Hui and Han people, engaging in agriculture or animal husbandry. The total cultivated land area in the region is nearly 15 million mu. The population in the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia accounts for 80% of the total population. The agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia have undergone land reform. The Inner Mongolia pasture is the largest pasture in our country, producing more than 10 million jin of fur and hides annually. The forest resources in Inner Mongolia are also very rich. In addition, the region is rich in mineral resources such as gold, iron, coal, salt, alkali, mica, and asbestos.
    The Mongolian people have their own language and writing system. However, before liberation, due to the lack of learning opportunities for the vast majority of working people, and the discrimination against the Mongolian language and writing by the reactionary ruling class, very few people were literate in Mongolian. After the liberation of the region, the People's Government has attached great importance to the development of ethnic languages and writing systems. Mongolian and Chinese courses are now offered in schools at all levels, and newspapers, periodicals, and books are published in Mongolian.
    The living habits of the Mongolian people vary slightly depending on the region they live in. The living habits of Mongolians in agricultural areas are mostly the same as those of Han people. The clothing of Mongolian people in nomadic areas is mainly made of wool and leather, and their food mainly consists of meat and dairy products. Herdsmen generally prefer tea, tobacco, and alcohol. Herdsmen live in yurts, and because they are nomadic, they often migrate according to the seasons. The main means of transportation are horses or ox carts.
    The Mongolian people generally believe in Lamaism. The People's Government implements a policy of freedom of religious belief, protecting temple property and lamas on the one hand, and encouraging lamas to participate in learning and labor production on the other.

　　内蒙古自治区概况
    内蒙自治区人民政府于一九四七年五月一日成立。该区位于我国东北部，北界蒙古人民共和国，东邻黑龙江、辽西两省，南靠热河、察哈尔省，西依绥远省。全区面积约六十余万平方公里，人口约二百三十余万。该区人民政府下辖兴安、呼纳、哲里木、昭乌达、锡林郭勒及察哈尔六个盟，共计三十二个旗，七个县和三个盟辖市。旗（县、市）以下即为努图克（区）、嘎查（村）、巴嘎（屯）等各级人民政权。以上各级人民政府大多由人民代表大会或各界人民代表会议选举产生。
    自治区境内除八十余万蒙族人民外，还有索伦族、达呼尔族、鄂伦春族、朝鲜族、回族、通古斯族、布里雅特蒙古族、锡伯族、雅库特族等兄弟民族约六万余人，余为汉族人民。
    自治区的人民主要从事农业生产，但牧畜业也很发达。兴安、哲里木两盟为农业区，锡林郭勒盟为游牧区，昭乌达、察哈尔两盟为半农半牧区，呼纳盟是农、牧、林业交错区。蒙族人民多与回族、汉族人民杂居，从事农业或牧畜业生产。全区耕地面积将近一千五百万亩。内蒙农业区的人口占总人口的百分之八十。内蒙的农业地区已经过土地改革。内蒙牧场为我国最大的牧场，每年可产皮毛千余万斤。内蒙地区的林业资源也很丰富。此外，该区还蕴藏有金、铁、煤、盐、碱、云母、石棉等矿产。
    蒙族有自己的语言文字。但在解放前，由于广大劳动人民没有学习的机会，以及反动统治阶级对蒙语、蒙文的歧视，所以识蒙文者极少。该区解放后，人民政府非常重视发展民族语言、文字的工作，现各级学校都设有蒙文和汉文课程，并用蒙文出版报刊、书籍等。
    蒙族人民的生活习惯，依其所居住的地区不同而略有区别。农业区蒙人生活习惯多与汉人相同。游牧区的蒙族人民，衣着原料以毛、皮为主，食品以肉食及奶品为主。牧民一般喜好茶、烟、酒。牧民住蒙古包，因系游牧，故常依季节迁徙。主要交通工具为马或牛车。
    蒙族人民一般信仰喇嘛教。人民政府实行宗教信仰自由政策，一面保护寺院财产及喇嘛，一面鼓励喇嘛参加学习和劳动生产。
