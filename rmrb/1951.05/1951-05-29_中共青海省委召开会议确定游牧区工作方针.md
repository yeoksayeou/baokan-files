　　The CCP Qinghai Provincial Committee Convenes Meeting
　　Determines Working Principles for Pastoral Areas
　　The Chinese Communist Party Qinghai Provincial Committee held a meeting in Xining from the 3rd to the 18th of this month to discuss work issues in the province's pastoral areas. Attending the meeting were CCP county committee secretaries from various counties in pastoral areas, as well as responsible individuals from Qinghai Province's trade, health, animal husbandry, and other relevant departments. After summarizing the work in pastoral areas over the past year, the meeting determined the future working principles and tasks for pastoral areas as: carrying out mass work among the people in pastoral areas, further eliminating counter-revolutionaries and habitual bandits in pastoral areas, actively conducting patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea among people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas, continuing to strengthen ethnic unity, and actively promoting regional autonomy.
　　Pastoral areas in Qinghai Province account for more than 86 percent of the province's total area, including all or most of Yushu, Nangqian, Chengduo, Dulan, Haiyan, Xinghai, Gonghe, Tongde, Tongren, and other counties, with approximately 300,000 Tibetan and Mongolian nomadic people. Over the past year, counties in pastoral areas have held one to three ethnic friendship meetings or people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all circles to discuss the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, particularly the ethnic policy item of the Common Program. Over the past year, cadres of the Communist Party and the People's Government have gone deep into pastoral areas to conduct numerous visits and propaganda activities among Tibetan and Mongolian herders, and have mediated more than 300 disputes among herder tribes, and punished a number of special agents and habitual bandits mixed among the minority ethnic groups. As a result, the unity of all ethnic groups has been strengthened, and social order in pastoral areas has been generally stabilized. In particular, the medical personnel of the People's Government treating diseases for people and animals, and the trade personnel organizing the exchange of goods and materials in pastoral areas, have been most welcomed by the herders. Songs praising Chairman Mao have spread throughout the entire grassland.
　　The meeting believes that the work in pastoral areas over the past year has been successful. However, the progress of work in various places is uneven. At present, pastoral areas should pay special attention to preventing counter-revolutionaries from infiltrating and engaging in activities that undermine and provoke ethnic unity, should thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and should use lamas and monasteries to conduct patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea among the broad masses of herders. The meeting also believes that in all future work in pastoral areas, continued attention should be paid to cultivating cadres from fraternal ethnic groups to create more favorable conditions for promoting regional autonomy. The meeting suggested that the Qinghai Provincial People's Government establish preparatory committees for regional autonomy, including representatives from all strata, in counties with concentrated Tibetan populations such as Yushu, Nangqian, Chengduo, Tongren, Tongde, and Xinghai; at the same time, to enrich the joint governments in areas with mixed ethnic populations such as Gonghe, Haiyan, and Dulan.

　　中共青海省委召开会议
    确定游牧区工作方针
    中国共产党青海省委员会，曾于本月三日到十八日，在西宁市召开会议，讨论该省游牧地区的工作问题。参加这次会议的有游牧区各县中共县委会书记，青海省贸易、卫生、畜牧等部门有关的负责人。会议在总结一年来游牧区的工作之后，确定了今后游牧区工作的方针和任务为：开展游牧区的人民群众工作，进一步肃清游牧地区的反革命分子和惯匪，对游牧区各族人民积极进行抗美援朝的爱国教育，继续加强民族团结，和积极推行区域自治。
    青海省游牧区约占全省面积百分之八十六以上，包括玉树、囊谦、称多、都兰、海宴、兴海、共和、同德、同仁等县的全部或大部，有藏族，蒙族游牧人民约三十万。一年来，游牧区各县都曾召开过一次到三次民族联谊会或各民族各界人民代表会议，讨论了中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领，特别是共同纲领的民族政策一项。一年来，共产党和人民政府的干部，深入游牧地区，向藏、蒙牧民进行了多次访问和宣传，并调解了牧民各部落间的三百多件纠纷事件，惩办了若干混迹在少数民族中的特务惯匪。这样，各民族的团结加强了，游牧区的社会秩序也大体稳定了。特别是人民政府的医疗人员为牧民人、畜治病，贸易工作人员组织游牧区的物资交流，最受牧民的欢迎。牧民歌颂毛主席的歌声传遍整个草原。
    会议认为：游牧区一年来的工作是有成绩的。但是，各地工作的进展不平衡。目前游牧区应特别防范反革命分子钻进来从事破坏和挑拨民族团结的活动，应彻底肃清反革命分子，并通过喇嘛和寺院对广大牧民进行抗美援朝的爱国教育。会议又认为：游牧区在今后各种工作中，应继续注意培养兄弟民族自己的干部，为推行区域自治创造更有利的条件。会议建议青海省人民政府在玉树、囊谦、称多、同仁、同德、兴海等藏族聚居的县份，建立包括各阶层参加的区域自治筹备委员会；同时、对共和、海宴、都兰等县民族杂居地区的联合政府加以充实。
