　　Over Ninety Percent of Population in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province Receives Patriotic Education
    According to statistics from mid-April, the number of people in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, who have received patriotic education has reached over 90% of the county's population. For more than a month, all gatherings, large and small, in the county have focused on popularizing patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. More than 1,500 propagandists and over 2,000 activists in the county have mostly formulated personal propaganda plans, implemented division of labor based on regions or households, and carried out in-depth propaganda to popularize current affairs education to every person in every region.
    The main characteristic of the popularization of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement in Jiaohe County is its close integration with the current central work. When carrying out this propaganda and education work, it was the most intense stage of the county's preparations for spring plowing; the "May 1st" parade also coincided with the time of universal plowing and sowing. Initially, most farmers were concerned that the parade would delay work and affect production. Therefore, the propagandists in each village and township divided the work according to production units and mutual aid groups, and carried out decentralized propaganda. For example, 29 propagandists and 43 activists in Yungang Village participated in 42 mutual aid groups in the village, which did not delay production and could carry out propaganda anytime, anywhere. In addition, the village also designated four propagandists to specifically conduct propaganda for 22 farmers who did not participate in mutual aid groups. While carrying out Resist America and Aid Korea education, the propagandists put forward the slogan "Do a good job in the bumper harvest movement and strengthen the country's economic power," and the production enthusiasm of the farmers who received propaganda education was very high. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1,430 mutual aid groups (including more than 7,200 farming households and more than 23,300 laborers) in the county have formulated bumper harvest plans and enthusiastically launched competitions. Many farmers, in order to participate in the parade without delaying production, plowed early and worked late. The spring planting preparations in Bao’an Village, led by labor model Han Ensuo, have all been completed, and trial planting has started ahead of schedule. The farmers in Boli Kezi Village said, "Get up five early and work five late, squeeze out a day of free time to participate in the parade."
    The Resist America and Aid Korea patriotic education in Jiaohe County has been popularized to the masses who have never participated in social activities. In the past, most elderly people rarely participated in various social activities, and some even prevented their children from participating, but they have also changed their attitudes in this patriotic education movement. For example, Ye Li, from Wanjia Baozi Village, did not participate in the Women's Federation or the mutual aid group in the past. After this patriotic education, she automatically requested to join the Women's Federation and the mutual aid group. Farmer Qu Youcai, from Nangang Village, used to hate meetings, and never spoke even when he attended meetings. Recently, after participating in the village's accusation meeting, he expressed that he would actively respond to all the government's calls and transform his backward thinking.

### 吉林省蛟河县十分之九以上人口受到爱国主义教育

　　吉林省蛟河县十分之九以上人口受到爱国主义教育
    吉林省蛟河县受到爱国主义教育的人，据四月中旬统计，已达全县人口百分之九十以上。一个多月以来，全县所有大小集会，都以普及抗美援朝的爱国主义教育为中心。全县一千五百余名宣传员和两千多名积极分子，大都制订了个人宣传计划，按地区或户口实行分工负责，深入宣传，把时事教育普及到每个地区的每个人。
    蛟河县普及抗美援朝运动的主要特点，是密切结合当前中心工作。在进行这次宣传教育工作时，正是全县准备春耕最紧张的阶段；“五一”游行，又值普遍开犁播种的时节。最初，多数农民顾虑游行耽误工夫，影响生产。于是各村屯的宣传员便按生产单位及互助组分工，分散进行宣传。如耘岗村的二十九名宣传员和四十三名积极分子，分别参加到全村的四十二个互助组里，既不耽误生产，又能随时随地宣传。另外，该村还指定四名宣传员专门对二十二户没有参加互助组的农民进行宣传。在进行抗美援朝教育的同时，宣传员们提出了“搞好丰产运动，加强国家经济力量”的口号，受到宣传教育的农民的生产情绪很高。据初步统计，全县已有一千四百三十多个互助组（包括七千二百余农户、两万三千三百多个劳动力），订出了丰产计划，热烈展开竞赛。许多农民为了参加游行又不耽误生产，都提前开犁，起早贪晚地工作。劳动模范韩恩所领导的保安屯，春种准备工作已全部结束，并提前开犁试种。勃利棵子屯的农民们说：“起五个早贪五个黑，挤出一天空闲时间好参加游行。”
    蛟河县抗美援朝爱国教育已普及到一向不参加社会活动的群众。过去一般老年人都很少参加各种社会活动，有的还阻挠自己的子女参加，但他们在这次爱国主义教育运动中也改变了态度。如万家堡子村的叶李氏，过去既不参加妇女会，也不参加互助组，经过这次的爱国主义教育后，即自动要求加入妇女会和互助组。南岗村的农民曲有财，从前讨厌开会，就是参加会议也从不发言。最近他参加了村中的控诉会后，即表示要积极响应政府的一切号召，改造自己的落后思想。
