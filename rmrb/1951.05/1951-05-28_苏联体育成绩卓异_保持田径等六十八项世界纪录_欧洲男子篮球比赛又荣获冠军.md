Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Remarkable Achievements in Soviet Sports; Holding 68 World Records in Athletics and Other Sports; Another Championship Won in European Men's Basketball

[This newspaper dispatch] (Xinhua News Agency Dispatch): Soviet sports achievements are outstanding. According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 20th: The recently published ninth issue of "Young Bolshevik" magazine carried an article by Orlov entitled "Soviet Athletes in International Competitions," stating that in recent years, the Soviet Union has achieved significant victories in international sports competitions. Currently, the Soviet Union holds 68 world records in track and field, swimming, weightlifting, skating, and shooting. The Soviet Union's achievements in sports have surpassed those of the United States, Sweden, France, Italy, Norway, Finland, and other countries. Five out of six world skating records were created by Soviet skaters. In 1949, the Soviet volleyball team won the World Men's Volleyball Championship. In 1950, Soviet athletes won the European Athletics Championships in Belgium, and the women's basketball team won the European Basketball Championship.

The Truth Daily published an article by Vereskov on the 19th, commenting on the Soviet basketball team's recent victory in the European Men's Basketball Championship held in Paris, saying: Seventeen countries participated in the competition, with the Soviet Union winning the championship, Czechoslovakia taking second place, and Bulgaria coming in fourth. Among all the teams from capitalist countries, only the French team won a third-place finish. The nine games played by the Soviet basketball team vividly demonstrated the undeniable superiority of Soviet sports. The teams from capitalist countries mainly emphasize appearance and individual skills, their tactics are outdated and formulaic, and the players perform a set of pre-arranged coordinated movements. However, the Soviet, Czech, and Bulgarian teams are armed with a collective artistry, which is a kind of artistry with great mobility and diverse skills.

　　苏联体育成绩卓异
    保持田径等六十八项世界纪录
    欧洲男子篮球比赛又荣获冠军
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏联体育成绩卓异。据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：最近出版的第九期《青年布尔什维克》杂志，刊载了奥尔洛夫的题为《国际竞赛中的苏联运动员》的文章说：近几年来苏联在国际体育竞赛中获得了重大的胜利。现在苏联在田径、游泳、举重、溜冰和射击等方面，保持着六十八项世界纪录。苏联在运动方面的成就已经超过了美国、瑞典、法国、意大利、挪威、芬兰等国。在六项世界溜冰纪录中有五项是由苏联溜冰家创造的。一九四九年苏联排球队赢得了世界男子排球赛锦标。一九五○年，苏联运动员在比利时赢得欧洲田径赛锦标，女子篮球队获得欧洲篮球赛冠军。
    十九日的真理报发表了维列斯科夫的文章，评论苏联篮球队最近在巴黎举行的欧洲男子篮球锦标赛中获得优胜说：参加这次比赛的有十七个国家，苏联赢得了冠军，捷克斯洛伐克获得了亚军，保加利亚得了第四名。在所有资本主义国家的球队中，只有法国的球队得了一个第三名。苏联篮球队参加的九场比赛，生动地证明了苏维埃体育的不可争辩的优越性。资本主义国家的球队主要是讲求外观和表现个人的技巧，它们的战术是陈旧的、公式化的，球员们玩着一套事先安排好的协同动作。但苏联以及捷克、保加利亚的球队，却被一种集体的球艺武装着，这是一种有极大的机动性和多样的技巧的球艺。
