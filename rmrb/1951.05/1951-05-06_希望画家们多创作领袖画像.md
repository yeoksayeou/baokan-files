　　Hoping Painters Will Create More Portraits of Leaders
　　To the Editor:
    I am grateful to the painters for creating such good paintings for us in 1950 as "The Party's Good Daughter - Zhao Guilan" (by Lin Gang), "Chairman Mao Talking with Peasants" (by Gu Yuan), and "The Great Meeting" (by Li Qi and Feng Zhen). Our great struggles and victories are inseparable from Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is always concerned about us and always leads our struggles. We urgently need to express these realities in a concentrated way with concrete images to teach and inspire us. Recently, after seeing the exhibition of Soviet propaganda paintings and caricatures, we felt this need even more strongly, and at the same time, we felt that our paintings about leaders are really too few to meet our needs!
    There are many Soviet paintings about the great leaders Lenin and Stalin. In this exhibition, there were more than twenty portraits with Comrade Stalin as the main subject alone. There are even more various propaganda and mobilization paintings related to the images of Lenin and Stalin. The portraits with Comrade Stalin as the main subject are all rich in profound content and are closely linked to every great struggle of the Soviet people. Some depict Stalin voting, while others depict Stalin teaching pilots and young pioneers how to fly. One can feel intimately that Stalin is always with them.
    Our leader Comrade Mao Zedong has also personally led every struggle during the Long March, the Land Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and now. But we rarely see such paintings. We can only see Chairman Mao's half-length portraits or the review images on Tiananmen Square. But Chairman Mao personally conducted investigations into the peasant movement in Hunan, personally led the Great Production Movement, and personally led the military struggle in northern Shaanxi with the masses when the Chiang Kai-shek's army attacked Yan'an. After the liberation of all of China, he called on us to step up national defense construction, and he also cared about the health of young people, met and talked with workers, and encouraged us to work hard in production. But such good paintings appear too rarely, and we hope to see such good paintings to inspire and educate ourselves.

### 希望画家们多创作领袖画像

　　希望画家们多创作领袖画像编辑同志：
    感谢画家们在一九五○年里，给我们创作了象《党的好女儿——赵桂兰》（林岗作），《毛主席和农民谈话》（古元作），《伟大的会见》（李琦、冯真作）等等好画。我们伟大的斗争和胜利是和毛主席分不开的。毛主席时时刻刻的关怀着我们，时时刻刻领导着我们的斗争。我们迫切需要用具体的形象把这些现实集中的表现出来，以教导我们和激励我们。最近我们看了苏联宣传画和讽刺画的展览，愈益感到有这种需要，同时也就感到我们关于领袖的画，实在是太少了，不能满足我们的要求！
    苏联关于伟大领袖列宁、斯大林同志的画是很多的。在这次展览会上，单就以斯大林同志为主体的造像来说，就有二十余幅之多。其它与列宁、斯大林形象关联着的各种宣传鼓动画为数更多。其中以斯大林同志为主体的造像，都是有丰富深刻的内容的，并且都紧密的联系着苏联人民的每一伟大斗争。或者画斯大林投票的神情，或者画斯大林教导着飞行员和少年队员学习驾驶技术。都能够亲切感到斯大林是时刻地和他们在一起的。
    我们的领袖毛泽东同志同样曾在长征中，在土地革命时期，在抗日战争中，在解放战争中，在现在，时刻亲身领导着我们的每一斗争，但我们却很少看到这样的画。我们只能看到毛主席的半身像或是天安门上的检阅像。但毛主席曾亲自作过湖南农民运动调查，曾亲自领导过大生产运动，曾在蒋胡军进攻延安时，亲自和群众一道领导陕北的军事斗争。在解放全中国以后，曾号召我们加紧进行国防建设，也曾关心着青年们的健康，和工人们见面谈话，鼓励我们努力生产。但这样的好画出现得太少了，我们希望看到这样的好画，以激励和教育我们自己。
