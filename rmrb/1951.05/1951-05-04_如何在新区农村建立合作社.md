　　How to Establish Cooperatives in Rural Areas of New Districts
        Zhou Jun
    In the vast rural areas of new districts, especially in areas where land reform has been completed, how to establish cooperatives has become an urgent demand of the people. During the Chongqing Municipal Farmers' Representative Conference, representatives requested the rapid organization of cooperatives to promote the sale of agricultural and sideline products and support agricultural production. Therefore, making efforts to establish cooperatives in land reform areas to serve this year's great production movement has become a serious task at present.
  Establish the Principle of Building Cooperatives Centered on Market Towns
    When establishing cooperatives in new rural areas, the principle of building cooperatives centered on market towns must first be established. We cannot repeat the old path of building cooperatives in every village. Because market towns are the exchange centers of rural areas, and areas with convenient transportation and concentrated populations, the main task of rural supply and marketing cooperatives is to supply members with production and living materials, and to promote the sale of agricultural and sideline products. In order to facilitate members and fully meet their requirements, to achieve inexpensive supply and timely sales, we must build cooperatives centered on market towns, uniting the surrounding villages. This will make it possible to achieve "four mores and one less," that is, more members, more funds, more business, more income, and less expenditure. In northern Jiangsu, because the method of building cooperatives in market towns was adopted, by the end of December last year, the number of members had reached 1.15 million, with a total of 867 primary-level cooperatives. The average number of members per cooperative was more than 1,320, with more than five cadres, and each cadre served more than 260 members. As a result, there was more business and less expenditure. The Meicun Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in southern Jiangsu originally had its address in Xiaoqiaotou Village, which was very inconvenient for the masses, resulting in sluggish business. From February to the end of August last year, the total transaction volume was more than 26 million yuan, the expenditure rate was 14.2 percent, and the loss was more than 1.2 million yuan. After the cooperative's address was moved to Meicun market town in early September last year, in the two months until the end of October, the total transaction volume was 148 million yuan, which was 19 times the previous monthly amount, the expenditure rate was 2.38 percent, and the net profit was 4.57 million yuan. This fully proves the correctness of the principle of building cooperatives in market towns.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, under the enemy's division and blockade, and with the lower purchasing power of farmers, building cooperatives in every village did play a considerable role. However, after land reform and the rapid recovery of agricultural production, the purchasing power of farmers has now increased. They require a wide variety of commodities for supply and sales. In addition to requiring cooperatives to supply some of the main production and living materials and promote the sale of some products, they need to conduct transactions in market towns. If we deviate from market towns today and continue to follow the path of building cooperatives in every village, it will be inconsistent with the economic activities of farmers, and it will be difficult for cooperatives to develop. Hebei Province, based on the new economic situation in rural areas, changed the practice of building cooperatives in every village and organized joint-village cooperatives, which greatly improved the organizational form of cooperatives. However, some joint-village cooperatives are still established according to administrative villages. Although this is a step forward compared to building cooperatives in every village in the past, members still feel inconvenient. For example, some counties established cooperatives according to administrative villages. After joining the cooperative, members still secretly tried to buy shares in the market town cooperative. Many people wanted to borrow the market town cooperative's membership card to buy coal and kerosene, because the cooperative established according to the administrative village "is inconvenient to buy goods, the price is not cheap, the goods are not complete, and the supply is not timely." From this, it can be seen that the masses welcome market town cooperatives.
  How to Start Establishing Cooperatives
    First, when establishing cooperatives in new rural areas, we should start from economic crop areas (such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, etc.) and special product areas, and build cooperatives centered on market towns. This meets the requirements of farmers. Generally speaking, the production in economic crop areas develops faster, and appropriately meeting the needs of farmers in these areas for production and living materials, and helping to promote the sale of products, is more urgent than in other areas. Second, the cooperative construction work should adopt a step-by-step approach of focusing on key points, concentrating forces, starting with typical pilot projects, and then gradually promoting them after absorbing experience. In areas with fewer market towns, cooperatives can be organized by uniting surrounding small villages with appropriately sized large villages as the unit. Third, after the cooperative is established, it must quickly develop its business, especially helping farmers to sell agricultural and sideline products. This is an urgent demand of farmers and is the key to the consolidation and development of cooperatives. Therefore, superior cooperatives or superior leading organs should vigorously assist, actively solve the difficulties of primary-level cooperatives in business operations, and establish business relationships with local state-owned trading companies to collect agricultural and sideline products on their behalf and supply production and living materials. In this way, not only will the cooperative's business be supported by state-owned trading companies, making it easier to develop, but also state-owned trading companies will strengthen their ties with the masses through the cooperative. In addition, it is also important for primary-level cooperatives to carefully investigate and count the needs of their members, formulate business plans, and carry out supply and sales business through order contracts.
  The Establishment of Organizations Must Be Closely Integrated with the Development of Business
    In new districts, the leading organs of cooperatives at all levels should be established first to be responsible for organizing and promoting the establishment of urban and rural primary-level cooperatives. When the number of primary-level cooperatives has developed to a certain extent, county-level joint supply and marketing cooperatives, provincial supply and marketing cooperative federations, and even cooperative federations in major administrative regions should be generated through democratic means. In order to closely integrate the establishment of organizations with the development of business and avoid business being separated from the organization, once a superior cooperative is established, it should immediately engage in business, bringing goods to the countryside, while publicizing, organizing, and selling goods. This method is very necessary and should be promoted. This will not only gain the trust of the masses, but also avoid the shortcomings of separating business from organization. However, in some areas, after the establishment of the provincial cooperative, it owns a large amount of funds and specializes in adjusting surpluses and deficiencies and market business, playing the role of a state-owned company, which is inconsistent with the spirit of developing cooperatives. All regions should take this as a warning.
  Several Tendencies to Be Prevented
    First, when organizing cooperatives in new districts, publicity should be realistic and not exaggerated or excessive. This is a very important point. Some places initially exaggerated the role of cooperatives, saying that cooperatives would respond to every request. However, after the cooperative was established, it did not meet the needs of the masses in everything, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses and even withdrawal from the cooperative. For example, in some places, it was publicized that each share would only collect three catties of rice, but when collecting shares, it was raised to thirteen catties. Members reflected that: "It's a lie from the beginning, like the cooperatives in the old society." As a result, they demanded to withdraw their shares.
    Second, the organization of cooperatives should not be too large, and the distance between the cooperative's address and the members' residences should not be too far. It is certainly not good to have cooperatives in every village, with small cooperatives and few people, but when building cooperatives centered on market towns, it is also inappropriate if there are too many people and the members' residences are too far from the cooperative. The experience in East China is that it is inconvenient to operate with too few members, but it is also inconvenient for democratic management if the organization is too large. Some primary-level cooperatives include forty or fifty villages, which is not appropriate. According to the experience of northern Jiangsu and Hunan, the number of members should be at least 1,000 or more, generally 4,000 to 5,000 is best, and no more than 10,000 at most. The area should not be too far, which is in line with the principle of facilitating the masses and reasonable operation.
    Third, after building cooperatives centered on market towns, we must actively develop members in the surrounding villages. However, if all members go to the market town cooperative to buy goods, it will inevitably be crowded, especially on market days. For example, the Meicun cooperative in southern Jiangsu has more than 1,000 transactions within two hours on market days. Members reflected that: "Time is money, it's not worth waiting for a long time." Therefore, in addition to expanding the cooperative's address and supplying goods by category, it is also necessary to set up distribution points or branches in villages with more members. For those with fewer members and no conditions to set up branches, a delivery system can be implemented, with peddlers delivering goods to their doorsteps, or members can be organized to help each other sell goods. This can also avoid crowding.
    In addition, the habit of cadres in many places of building cooperatives based on administrative villages is also an obstacle to building cooperatives in market towns. Some district and village cadres even prevent the masses from joining market town cooperatives on the pretext of "destroying the cooperatives in their administrative villages." Leading organs at all levels should patiently educate cadres at all levels and explain the benefits of establishing cooperative organizations according to economic regions. However, when electing the board of directors and supervisors of cooperatives, we should take care of all villages, which is very necessary for the work.

### 如何在新区农村建立合作社

　　如何在新区农村建立合作社
        周钧
    在广大新区农村，特别是在已经完成土地改革的地区，如何建立合作社，已成为新区群众的迫切要求。重庆市召开农民代表会议时，代表们就要求迅速组织合作社，推销农、副业产品，支持农业生产。因此努力做好土地改革地区的建立合作社工作，为今年的大生产运动服务，已成为目前的严重任务。
  确定以集镇为中心的建社原则
    在新区建立合作社，首先要确定以集镇为中心的建社原则。不能再走村村建社的旧路。因为集镇是农村的交换中心，及交通便利和人口集中的地区，农村供销社的主要任务是供应社员生产、生活资料，推销农业和副业产品。为了便利社员，充分满足社员的要求，作到廉价供应，及时推销，就必须以集镇为中心，联合周围村庄建社。这样即可能做到“四多一少”，即社员多、资金多、业务多、收益多、开支少。苏北因为采取了集镇建社的办法，至去年十二月底止，社员已达一百十五万人，基层社共八百六十七个。平均每社社员为一千三百二十余人，五个多干部，每个干部服务二百六十余个社员，因之，业务多，开支少。苏南梅村镇供销社，原先社址在小桥头村，对群众很不方便，因而业务清淡。去年二月至八月底总交易额为二千六百多万元，开支率为百分之十四点二，亏损一百二十余万元。去年九月初社址移到梅村集镇后，到十月底止，两个月中，总交易额为一亿四千八百万元，等于过去每月的十九倍，开支率为百分之二点三八，纯利为四百五十七万元。这充分证明了集镇建社原则的正确。
    抗日战争期间，在敌人的分割封锁局面下，再加农民购买力较低，村村建社，确实起了相当作用。但经过土地改革和农业生产的迅速恢复，目前农民购买力已经提高。他们要求供应与推销的商品种类繁多，除需要合作社供应一部分主要的生产、生活资料，推销一部产品外，需要在集镇上进行交易。如果今天脱离集镇，仍然走村村建社的道路，就和农民的经济活动不一致，合作社将不易获得发展。河北省根据农村中新的经济情况，改变了村村建社的作法，组织联村合作社，使合作社的组织形式大大提高了一步。但有些联村社，仍是按行政村建立的。这样虽然比过去村村建社进了一步，但社员仍感不方便。如有的县按行政村建立了合作社，社员入了社后，还偷着设法在集镇的合作社入股。好多人想借集镇社社员证买煤及煤油，原因是按行政村所设的社“买货不方便，价格不便宜，货色不齐全，供应不及时”。由此看来，群众是欢迎集镇合作社的。
  怎样着手建立合作社
    第一，在新区农村建立合作社，应首先从经济作物地区（如棉、麻、烟等）及特产区开始，以集镇为中心进行建社。这是适合农民的要求的。一般的说，经济作物区的生产发展较快，适当的满足这些地区的农民对生产、生活资料的需要，帮助推销产品，也就较其他地区更为迫切。其次，建社工作应采取有重点地集中力量，由点到面的步骤。开始应有步骤的进行典型试办，然后吸取经验逐步推广。在集镇较少的地区，可以适中的大村为单位，联合周围小村组织合作社。第三，在合作社建立以后，必须迅速开展业务，特别是帮助农民推销农业副业产品。这是农民的迫切要求，也是合作社巩固与发展的关键。因之，上级社或上级领导机关应大力协助，积极解决基层社在业务经营中的困难，并与当地国营贸易公司建立业务关系，代收农业副业产品，供应生产、生活资料。这样，不但合作社的业务有了国营贸易公司的支持，易于发展。同时国营贸易公司也将通过合作社加强与群众的联系。此外，基层合作社认真调查统计社员的需要，制订业务计划，通过订货合同，开展供销业务，也是一个值得注意的问题。
  建立组织与开展业务必须密切结合
    在新区应首先建立各级合作社的领导机关，负责组织推动城乡基层社的建社工作。在基层社发展到一定数量时，再通过民主方式产生县联合供销社、省供销合作总社，以至大行政区的合作总社。为了使建立组织与开展业务紧密结合，避免业务脱离组织，上级社一经建立，即应经营业务，带着商品下乡，一面宣传，一面组织，一面卖货。这种方法，是很必要的，应当加以提倡。这样既可取信于群众，又可避免业务与组织脱节的缺点。但有的地区，成立省社后，拥有大批资金，专作调剂有无及市场生意，起了国营公司的作用，这与发展合作社的精神是不符合的。各地应引以为戒。
  须要防止的几个偏向
    第一，在新区组织合作社进行宣传时，要实事求是不要夸大、过火。这是很重要的一点。有的地方开始过分宣传合作社的作用，把合作社说得有求必应。但到合作社成立后，并不事事满足群众要求，以致引起群众不满，甚至退社。比如某些地方组社时宣传每股只收稻谷三斤，而收股时又提到十三斤，社员反映说：“一开始就骗人，和旧社会的合作社一样。”结果纷纷要求退股。
    第二，合作社的组织不要过分庞大，社址与社员的住址距离不要太远。村村建社，社小人少固然不好，但以集镇为中心建社时，如果人太多，社员的住址离合作社太远亦不妥当。华东的体验是社员太少了不便经营，但组织太大了，也不便于民主管理。有的基层社包括四五十个村庄，这是不合适的。根据苏北及湖南的经验，社员人数最少在一千人以上，一般以四五千人为最好，最多不要超过一万人，地区不可太远，这是符合于便利群众合理经营的原则的。
    第三，以集镇为中心建社后，要积极发展周围村的社员。但社员都到集镇社买货，势必拥挤不堪，特别是在集日。如苏南梅村社，到赶集的日子，在两个钟头内，即有千人以上的交易。社员反映说：“工夫就是钱，等久了不合算。”因此除扩大社址分类供应外，在社员较多的村庄设分销处或分社也是必要的。社员少，无设分社条件者，可实行送货制，组织货郎担将货送到门上，或组织社员互助代销。这样也可避免拥挤现象。
    此外，许多地方干部存在着以行政村为单位建社的习惯，也是阻碍集镇建社的一个障碍。有些区村干部甚至以“破坏本行政村的合作社”为借口阻止群众向集镇合作社入股。各级领导机关应耐心教育各级干部，说明按经济区域建立合作社机构的好处。但在选举合作社的理监事时，则应照顾到各村，这一点对工作是十分必要的。
