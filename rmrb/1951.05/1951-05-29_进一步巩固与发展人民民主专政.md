	Further Consolidate and Develop the People's Democratic Dictatorship
	Over the past year or so, the political and legal departments of people's governments at all levels across the country, in their work of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and promoting the construction of democratic political power, have achieved great successes and gained good experience, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, by combining with the nationwide movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and economic construction. The current issue is to further consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship on the basis of existing work. The "Report on the Situation and Current Tasks of Political and Legal Work" of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government (see this newspaper on May 27) has been approved and promulgated by the 84th Executive Meeting of the State Council, and people's governments at all levels across the country should immediately conduct a general discussion and implementation.
	To achieve the tasks of political and legal work in 1951, it is necessary to ideologically overcome the tendency to neglect the work of political power construction. This erroneous ideological tendency still exists to varying degrees among cadres in some departments. They have not yet deeply realized that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. They do not truly understand that only when the people not only hold political power, but also rely on the people's own awareness and efforts to fully exert the role of political power, especially the role of dictatorship, can we thoroughly eliminate all reactionary forces and influences on a national scale and in their entirety, and consolidate and develop the political, economic, and cultural interests and construction undertakings of the people. The root of the ideological tendency to neglect political power work is essentially the result of our cadres being eroded by vulgar liberalist thought. If we do not resolutely struggle against this erroneous ideological tendency, and instead adopt a vulgar liberalist attitude, allowing this erroneous ideological tendency to spread, it will inevitably develop into a serious trend, corroding and weakening the system of the people's democratic dictatorship. This is something we can never tolerate.
	Not long ago, some localities did not pay enough attention to the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, did not promptly and resolutely correct the deviation of "unlimited leniency," and dared not vigorously mobilize the masses to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Was not the reason for this the neglect of the basic task of the people's democratic dictatorship? Some cadres' understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries even lagged far behind the masses, turning a blind eye to the demands of the masses, and "thinking was not clear." Was this not due to the mischief of vulgar liberalism? In land reform, some areas neglected to combine it with the work of political power construction, separating land reform from political power construction, making them two unrelated tasks. Was this not obviously wrong? All this shows that our government workers and party leaders at all levels do not have a deep understanding of the great significance of the people's democratic dictatorship. As the report of the Political and Legal Committee points out: "Up to now, some comrades still do not understand the great significance of the people's democratic dictatorship, which Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us about, and therefore neglect the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; neglect the criticism and elimination of the remaining old political power styles and old legal viewpoints; neglect the importance of holding regular people's representative conferences and government committees; neglect the coordination of land reform and the people's construction of political power; neglect the enormous role and close relationship of current political and legal work to the 'lower-level foundation,' i.e., economic construction; and belittle the work of political and legal departments, unwilling to do political and legal work, considering this work dispensable. These views should be overcome, otherwise they will hinder the consolidation and development of the people's democratic dictatorship." Therefore, in the current discussion of the situation and tasks of political and legal work, and in the process of future implementation, we should first seriously examine ourselves ideologically and raise our awareness.
	For the political and legal work departments and their cadres and staff at all levels, it is still necessary at present to thoroughly understand the tasks of the political and legal departments ideologically. "The task of the political and legal departments is mainly the concrete implementation of the people's democratic dictatorship, to guide the political struggle of the masses." This view should be universally established by the political and legal departments and political and legal workers. Only by taking the guidance of the masses' political struggle as the universal thinking of the political and legal work departments and their personnel can we fully establish the excellent style of the political and legal departments and form a brand-new and complete political and legal work system.
	The working style of our government departments is basically good and essentially comes from the masses and goes to the masses. However, some individual departments and links more or less show the remnants of the bad working style left over from the reactionary ruling institutions. Its nature is a bureaucratic and yamen style that is divorced from the masses. For example, some courts require twenty-nine procedures to handle a single official document. This is proof that the remnants of the yamen style from the reactionary ruling period have not been eliminated. Some of our comrades, after smashing the Kuomintang reactionary political power institutions, became ideologically paralyzed and did not fully guard against the remaining influence of the reactionary yamen style, so that some unconsciously became infected. Some comrades not only contracted such a bad style but were also captured by the reactionaries in "theory," even regarding the reactionary "Six Codes" as "classics" and thinking they had "learned" something good, smugly congratulating themselves. This is most ridiculous. In addition, some comrades often do not know how to connect with the masses, nor how to proceed from the actual situation. Therefore, they often lack creativity, only knowing how to stick to established rules or subjectively copying local experiences, putting a hat on Peter to pay Paul. These should also be overcome.
	We should make every political and legal worker understand that political and legal work is a practical work closely integrated with the mass movement. Therefore, we must thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the yamen style and strive to overcome the style of subjectivism and conservatism.
	According to the current situation and the general requirements of national construction work, the task of political and legal work in the future lies in consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship. In carrying out this task, we must grasp the central link in order to promote overall work. What is the central link? In politics, it is to continue to complete land reform and thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary remnants. In political power construction, it is to further hold well the people's representative conferences or people's congresses at all levels and from all walks of life, which are sufficient to unite people from all walks of life to jointly carry out work. After the promulgation of the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences at All Levels," the State Council also issued the "Instructions on the Work of People's Democratic Political Power Construction" and the "Instructions on Holding People's Representative Conferences in Districts of Cities with a Population of More Than 100,000" on April 24 this year. Now, the vast majority of provinces, counties, cities, and multi-ethnic regions across the country have successively convened people's representative conferences, and the people's representative conferences in provinces and most cities have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress. The meetings in various places are being held better each time, and the experience is increasing each time. The broad masses of people and cadres have gradually recognized the importance of the people's representative conferences and their enormous role. However, some local governments and cadres do not yet fully understand this. There are even a few responsible cadres in counties and districts who have not yet discussed the above-mentioned organizational rules and two instructions of the representative conferences at all levels. This still needs to be further checked and urged by governments at all levels, especially the political and legal departments.
	In his speech at the Third People's Representative Conference in Beijing on February 28 this year, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "The system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses is the basic system of our country, and it is the best and basic organizational form of the people's democratic political power. Our country is a country of the system of people's representative conferences and people's congresses." If we do not have a full understanding of the basic system of the country and do not earnestly implement it, then this is a fundamental political error in principle.
	Experience has proved that in places where the representative conferences have been held well, the relationship between the government and the people is becoming increasingly close, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Whether it is resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, or the implementation of other policies and various construction tasks, they can proceed smoothly and achieve good results. Therefore, it is very necessary to adhere to holding people's representative conferences and government committees at all levels on schedule. In the people's representative conferences at all levels, in addition to fully utilizing the existing successful experiences, we should also pay special attention to handling the representatives' proposals. Because these proposals precisely represent the opinions of the masses of people on the government's work of inspection, supervision, criticism, and improvement. Correctly and perfectly handling these proposals can more comprehensively concentrate the opinions of the masses and give full play to the role of the people's representative conferences.
	We hope that the governments in various places, especially the political and legal departments and cadres, will earnestly discuss this report of the Political and Legal Committee, inspect and improve the work of the political and legal departments at all levels, and further consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 进一步巩固与发展人民民主专政

　　进一步巩固与发展人民民主专政
    全国各地人民政府的政法部门，一年多以来，在巩固人民民主专政、推进民主政权建设的工作中，由于与广大群众的抗美援朝土地改革和镇压反革命运动及财经建设工作相结合，在中央人民政府的正确领导之下，已有了很大成绩，并且取得了很好的经验。现在的问题是要在已有的工作基础上，进一步巩固与发展人民民主专政。中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会“关于政法工作的情况和目前任务”（见五月二十七日本报）的报告，已经政务院第八十四次政务会议批准公布，全国各地人民政府，应即普遍加以讨论与执行。
    为要实现一九五一年政法工作的任务，必须从思想上克服忽视政权建设工作的倾向。这种错误的思想倾向，目前仍然在各种不同的程度上存在于若干部门的干部中。他们实际上还没有深刻认识革命的根本问题是政权问题。他们还没有真正懂得：只有在人民不但掌握了政权，而且依靠人民群众自己的觉悟与努力，充分发挥了政权的作用，首先是专政作用的条件下，我们才有可能在全国范围内和全体规模上，彻底消灭一切反动的势力和影响，才能巩固与发展人民的政治、经济、文化的利益和建设事业。忽视政权工作的思想倾向的根源，本质上是由于我们的干部受了庸俗的自由主义思想侵蚀的结果。假如我们不坚决向这种错误的思想倾向作斗争，而同样采取了庸俗的自由主义的态度，放任这种错误的思想倾向弥漫起来，就必然会使它发展成为严重的倾向，腐蚀、削弱人民民主专政的制度。这是我们所决不能容忍的。
    不久以前，有些地方对于镇压反革命的工作重视不够，没有及时地坚决地纠正“宽大无边”的偏向，不敢大张旗鼓发动群众镇压反革命，其原因难道不是忽视了人民民主专政的基本任务吗？有的干部甚至对于镇压反革命的认识，远远落于群众之后，对群众的要求熟视无睹，“思想不通”，这难道不是由于庸俗的自由主义的作怪吗？在土地改革中，有的地区忽视与政权建设工作相结合，把土地改革与政权建设分开，成了两项各不相干的工作，这不是显然错误的吗？这些都说明了我们各级政府工作人员和党的领导干部，对于人民民主专政的重大意义，在认识上是不深刻的。正如政法委员会的报告中所指出的：“迄今还有些同志不了解毛主席所屡屡指示过我们的人民民主专政的重大意义，因而忽视镇压反革命工作；忽视对残存的、旧的政权作风及旧的法律观点的批判与清除；忽视定期召开人民代表会议和政府委员会的重要性；忽视土地改革与人民建政工作的配合；忽视目前政法工作对于‘下层基础’即经济建设工作的巨大作用及其密切的关系；轻视政法部门工作，不愿作政法工作，认为这种工作可有可无。这些观点，应该加以克服，不然就会妨害人民民主专政的巩固和发展。”因此，在目前讨论政法工作的情况和任务及在今后执行的过程中，应该首先从思想上认真检讨，提高觉悟。
    对于各级政法工作部门及其干部和工作人员来说，目前从思想上彻底明了政法部门的任务，仍然是必要的。“政法部门的任务，主要是关于人民民主专政的具体实施，要指导群众的政治斗争。”这个观点，是政法部门和政法工作者亟应普遍树立的。只有把指导群众的政治斗争，作为政法工作部门及其人员的普遍的思想，我们才能够完全树立政法部门的优良作风，才能形成一套崭新的完整的政法工作制度。
    目前我们政府各部门的工作作风基本上是良好的，基本上是从群众中来、到群众中去的，但有个别部门和个别环节，或多或少地表现出反动统治机构遗留下来的坏作风的残余，它的性质就是脱离群众的官僚衙门作风。比如有的法院，处理一件公文，竟要经过二十九道手续，这就是反动统治时期衙门作风的残余没有肃清的证明。我们有些同志，在粉碎了国民党反动政权机构之后，引起了思想上的麻痹，没有充分地警惕反动衙门作风的残余影响，以致有的不自觉地被传染了。有的同志不但染上那样恶劣的作风，而且在“理论”上也做了反动派的俘虏，连反动的“六法全书”也奉为“经典”，还自以为“学到”了什么好东西，自鸣得意，这是最可笑的。另外，也有些同志往往不会联系群众，不会从实际情况出发，因此，他们往往缺乏创造性，只知墨守成规，或者主观主义地把局部的经验东抄西搬，张冠李戴。这些也都应该加以克服。
    我们应该使每一个政法工作人员都明白政法工作是一种与群众运动紧密结合的实际工作。因此，必须彻底肃清衙门作风的残余，并努力克服主观主义、保守主义的作风。
    依据当前的形势和国家建设工作总的要求，今后政法工作的任务就在于巩固与发展人民民主专政。在执行这个任务的时候，必须抓住中心环节，才能推进全面的工作。什么是中心环节呢？在政治上是继续完成土地改革，彻底肃清一切反革命残余，在政权建设上，就是要进一步开好足以团结各界人民共同进行工作的各级各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会。在“各级人民代表会议组织通则”发布以后，今年四月二十四日，政务院又发布了“关于人民民主政权建设工作的指示”和“关于十万人口以上的城市召开区各界人民代表会议的指示”。现在全国最大多数省、县、市和多民族区域都已先后召开了各界人民代表会议，省和多数市的人民代表会议并已代行了人民代表大会的职权。各地的会议一次比一次开得好，经验也一次比一次多，广大人民和干部都已逐渐认识了人民代表会议的重要性和它的巨大作用。但是有些地方的政府和干部，对于这一点还没有充分的理解。甚至于有少数县、区政府的负责干部，对于上述各级代表会议的组织通则和两项指示，至今还没有加以讨论。这还有待于各级政府，特别是政法部门继续加以检查与督促。
    刘少奇同志在今年二月二十八日在北京第三届人民代表会议上的讲话中指出：“人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，是我们国家的基本制度，是人民民主政权的最好的基本的组织形式，我们的国家就是人民代表会议与人民代表大会制的国家。”我们对于国家的基本制度，如果没有充分的认识，没有认真的执行，那末，这就是一个带根本原则性的政治错误。
    经验证明，凡是开好了代表会议的地方，政府与人民的关系日益亲密，广大人民群众的积极性空前提高，无论抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命及其他一切政策的实施和各项建设工作，都能顺利进行，获得良好成绩。因此，坚持按期召开各级人民代表会议和政府委员会，是非常必要的。在各级人民代表会议中，除已有的成功经验应充分运用以外，还应该特别认真处理代表的提案。因为这些提案正是代表着人民群众对于政府工作的检查、督促和批评、改进的意见。正确而完善地处理这些提案，就能更全面地集中群众的意见，发挥人民代表会议的作用。
    我们希望各地政府，特别是政法部门和干部，认真地讨论政法委员会的这个报告，检查与改进各级政法部门的工作，进一步巩固与发展人民民主专政。
