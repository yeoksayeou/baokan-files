Recently, I, along with Comrade Lin Boqu and other comrades, visited Northeast China for an inspection. We traveled throughout the entire Northeast, deeply engaging with the various changes in the lives of the people. The experiences we had were so moving that I felt compelled to share my impressions with the nation and the world, reporting on the future of the new China that is being forged, with our Northeast leading the way in this process.

This is not an attempt to provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the Northeast. Rather, it is a simple summary of the most striking scenes and topics that left the deepest impressions on me during our 4,260-kilometer journey through the region. We visited 54 different areas and projects, including the seven major cities of the Northeast, as well as four villages that had completed land reform. We inspected 11 factories, one mine, countless welfare institutions, and cultural organizations. In each place, we listened to oral reports or received written reports. Additionally, we conducted individual interviews with ordinary farmers, workers, factory managers, and government administrative officials.

Thus, we were able to conduct an in-depth, realistic, and comprehensive study of the great strides made in the Northeast.

In the lives of farmers after land reform, we saw significant improvements in economic conditions, cultural activities, and health conditions. We witnessed how these advances positively influenced the urban working class, who showed great enthusiasm in their efforts to restore and rebuild industry. We also observed how our government and the Communist Party of China worked thoroughly, corrected mistakes to seek truth, fully recognized the strength of the working class and peasants, and mobilized this force to achieve even greater successes.

Agriculture and Land Reform

When the War of Liberation was at its most intense in Northeast China, land reform had already begun. In fact, it was during the peak of the Nationalists' power and when the people's army was strategically retreating—from July to December 1946—that 12,000 cadres were sent to the countryside to carry out this work. Their mission was to mobilize the struggle against feudal lords and bandits, establishing a base to consolidate the revolution throughout the region.

This was not an easy task, as the reactionary forces were very stubborn. However, the peasant masses gradually understood the importance of the land reform movement. By the end of 1947, the enemy had suffered defeat in the socio-economic aspects of rural life, just as they had begun to crumble on the battlefield. By the end of 1948, the remnants of the Nationalist bandits in Northeast China had been completely eliminated, and all ten provinces had been liberated. Thus, the way was paved to consolidate land reform and the new life that followed.

The farmers of Northeast China enthusiastically embraced this new life. In 1949, the total agricultural output reached 1,450 million tons of grain (excluding 200 million tons of by-products). In 1950, approximately 1,800 million tons were produced. The 1950 output reached 93% of the 1943 output, the highest under Japanese imperialist rule. However, the average yield per hectare had significantly increased compared to 1943, and in some regions, such as Baicheng County in Heilongjiang, the productivity reached the figures of 1943.

In my observation, the unprecedented surge in agricultural production was due to the following reasons:

A. The farmers are now the owners of the land.
B. Cultivation methods have improved.
C. Agricultural labor is well-organized.
D. Model workers, Communist Party members, and Youth League members set an example.
E. The government takes care of the people in times of disaster.
F. After paying taxes and expenses, there is still surplus money and grain, encouraging farmers to expand production.

I would like to briefly analyze each of these reasons.

Farmers as Landowners

When you enter a village where land reform has long been a reality, you can immediately see from the people's faces, their confident expressions, and their upright posture, that they are the owners of the land. Everywhere you look, you see a new attitude towards life. The entire atmosphere is meaningful. The village is bustling with activity; farmers and their families are either working or studying. The houses and streets are clean and tidy. All of this stems from one fact: the farmers can point to the fields and say with satisfaction, "This is mine." Look, such an important message can be expressed in such a simple way.

A table can more clearly express the same situation. In one of the villages we visited, Yonggui Village, which belongs to Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, we can understand its recent history from the following figures:

Land and Property Ownership by Class Before and After Land Reform

| Class   | Population (Percentage) | Land (Mou) (Percentage) | Houses (Percentage) | Horses (Percentage) | Vehicles (Percentage) |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Hired Laborers | 383 (41.9%) | 41.9 (0.4%) | 14 (6.1%) | 10 (7.2%) | 2 (10.5%) |
| Poor Peasants | 117 (17.3%) | 17.3 (0.6%) | 6.1 (14.0%) | 6.1 (10.5%) | 10.5 (14.0%) |
| Middle Peasants | 82 (12.1%) | 45.3 (6.9%) | 20 (8.8%) | 29 (21.0%) | 4 (21.1%) |
| Rich Peasants | 131 (19.4%) | 315.7 (47.84%) | 92 (40.4%) | 55 (39.9%) | 9 (47.3%) |
| Landlords | 63 (9.3%) | 208.4 (45.2%) | 102 (44.7%) | 44 (31.9%) | 4 (21.1%) |
| Total | 676 | 569.8 | 228 | 138 | 19 |

After Land Reform

| Class   | Population (Percentage) | Land (Mou) (Percentage) | Houses (Percentage) | Horses (Percentage) | Vehicles (Percentage) |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Hired Laborers | 285 (37%) | 189.26 (36.9%) | 95 (41.7%) | 47 (44.4%) | 13 (62.0%) |
| Poor Peasants | 166 (22%) | 110.22 (21.4%) | 52 (22.8%) | 21 (19.9%) | 3 (14.2%) |
| Middle Peasants | 93 (12%) | 62.93 (12.3%) | 36 (15.8%) | 17 (16.0%) | 5 (23.8%) |
| Rich Peasants | 146 (19%) | 96.94 (18.8%) | 32 (14.0%) | 16 (15.0%) | 0 |
| Landlords | 82 (10%) | 54.45 (10.6%) | 13 (5.7%) | 5 (4.7%) | 0 |
| Total | 772 | 513.80 | 228 | 106 | 21 |

From this table, you can see that the land in Yonggui Village is indeed owned by the tillers. The result is that in 1949, production increased by an average of one dan per mou compared to before the land reform. In every place we passed through in Northeast China, we found the same situation and the same results.

(Note 1) During the land reform and after the land reform, new households moved into the village.
(Note 2) Locally, one "small" mou is approximately equal to ten mu, and one mu is approximately equal to one-sixth of an acre.

Improvement in Cultivation Methods

With the completion of the basic steps of land reform, the second step was to improve production methods. This means, in addition to the reclamation of wasteland and irrigation of farmland, the long-term cultivation, seasonal cultivation, and daily work were raised to a scientific level. This has become a widespread movement in Northeast China. Deep plowing, fine tillage, fertilization, weeding, and other new methods are now standard cultivation steps. Farmers in Northeast China also like to use modern agricultural tools, select seeds, and protect livestock scientifically. In one of the villages we visited, there are some examples that can illustrate why this mass movement to apply science to agriculture has emerged.

Ba'an Tun is a village in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province. Before the liberation of Northeast China, it was known for its poverty. Now, it is famous not only for its prosperity but also for its excellent cultivation techniques. Here are some statistics about Ba'an Tun:

* In 1947, it had 30 head of livestock.
* In 1950, it had 42 head of livestock.
* In 1947, it used 10 sets of agricultural tools.
* In 1950, it used 27 sets (including Western plows and combined harrow-plows awarded by the Northeast Agricultural Department).
* In 1947, it cultivated 38.8 mou of land.
* In 1950, it cultivated 53.06 mou of land.
* In 1947, 66% of the land was fertilized.
* In 1950, 90.5% of the land was fertilized.
* In 1947, the total production was 240 dan.
* In 1950, the total production was 700 dan.

From the above, we see that new cultivation methods and new tools have greatly increased production for the farmers of Northeast China. We can also see this from a specific example from Ba'an Tun's farmers.

Farmer Old Zhang compared his millet harvest with his neighbor Ye Jin. He was upset to find that he only harvested 1.5 dan, while Ye Jin harvested 4 dan, and had 50% more stalks to feed the livestock. During the exchange of work experience, it was discovered that Ye Jin plowed the land with a Western plow, while Old Zhang used his old-style harrow. When Ye Jin went to the field, the tall, lush millet hid his body; Old Zhang was so angry that he burned his harrow and swore never to use these outdated tools again.

The farmers of Ba'an Tun also gained another valuable experience: using new cultivation methods can save labor and increase the use of livestock. For example, from spring plowing to summer planting, if 24.5 man-days and 10 head of livestock are used for 10 mu of land with old-style tools, only 10 man-days and the same number of livestock are needed with new tools. Thus, new tools can save 10.75 laborers. Because new tools were used in all work, during the spring and summer of the previous year, the farmers of Ba'an Tun saved 372 laborers. Many farmers were able to engage in other work. As a result, they increased their income by 658 million yuan in two seasons.

This is not to say that Northeast China has solved all the problems of new cultivation methods. Far from it. It still needs a lot of technical knowledge and experience. The important fact is that the farmers have realized that with the help of science, great progress can be made. This is also what the Northeast Agricultural Department frequently guides them through various activities. For example, during the recent wheat harvest, under the guidance of department-sent technicians, a village harvested more than 4,000 bundles in one day. Previously, the highest record farmers could achieve was 300 bundles, and that was with the greatest effort. Such concrete evidence has had a very good effect on the farmers' minds, and they are willing to apply the results of these experiments to their plans and daily work.

This progressive thinking has another important influence, which I call its impact on people's lives.

Village head Jin Chenglin of Yonggui Village told us, "Before the land reform, we only had 11 middle peasants, but there were 72 hired laborers and poor peasants. Now, about 90% of our village are middle peasants. Some farmers, although they do not have livestock, are already well-fed and clothed. Their living conditions are not much different from others. They are called poor peasants only because they do not have horses."

From the figures listed in the Yonggui Village table, it is proven that Jin Chenglin's words are true. Moreover, we see that since the completion of the land reform and the use of new tools, the village's wealth has increased by 40%, and the farmers' income from sideline production has increased by about 45%.

If you multiply the progress of villages like Ba'an Tun and Yonggui by thousands of other Northeast villages, you can very accurately understand the significance of liberation for our country's farmers and the prosperity brought by new methods and new tools.

Organization of Agricultural Labor

The organization of agricultural labor in Northeast China follows the scientific and democratic principles outlined by Vice Chairman Gao in his March 1950 speech. At that time, he said, "Neglecting the initiative of this individual economy or suppressing this initiative is not allowed, but at the same time, we must pay great attention to developing and organizing mutual aid cooperation to develop the rural economy."

The meaning of these words is to emphasize that the formation of mutual aid cooperation should be based on voluntary participation and mutual assistance. They are formed and operate according to the actual situation of each individual area. At the same time, they must also consider the needs of agricultural plans and sideline production in each area, the demands of the peasant masses, and the capabilities of the cadres engaged in organization. Because this organizational work is quite complex, the greatest attention is paid to the actual work of these mutual aid groups, rather than their surface forms. Moreover, these groups are encouraged to develop long-term and are linked to major tasks in the rural economy, such as the widespread use of new agricultural tools and consumer cooperatives. The central goal of these groups is to increase production and demonstrate to the farmers that collective work is always better than individual work.

In every village we visited, there were these cooperative organizations. We saw that they had already applied scientific division of labor methods and reasonable allocation of labor in farm work. The cadres were very meticulous in calculating the effectiveness of various tools, livestock, and the farmers' own work. Everything was calculated according to work units and the time required to complete each task.

Work was allocated in the most democratic way. The small group system is universal, with each group responsible for one task and each group having a leader. In the cooperative groups, each person's daily remuneration for work is calculated by democratic appraisal according to labor units. Their principle is "the more work, the greater the remuneration." This entire set of methods seems to have satisfied every group, boosted the farmers' morale, and given them confidence to face various difficulties in work.

Mutual aid groups make the use of labor more efficient and the land more deeply tilled. We can see an example of this from the following table on the production situation of Ba'an Tun in recent years.

Comparison of Production in Recent Years

| Year | Total Production | Average Production per Mou | Remarks |
|------|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| 1947 | 240 dan | 6.5 dan | Due to drought, the increase in production was not significant. |
| 1948 | 380 dan | 8.0 dan | |
| 1949 | 490 dan | 8.4 dan | |
| 1950 | 700 dan | 11.5 dan | |

We also see that although the prevalent small-scale mutual aid groups in Northeast China at present, there are already some active elements who want to take a further leap. These leading elements have already organized larger cooperatives and production brigades. Simply put, a story of this kind can illustrate the progress made by some Northeast farmers and is very worthwhile.

In the spring of 1947, the initial stage of land reform in Ba'an Tun was completed. From this struggle, a good cadre named Han En emerged. He and his comrades took the lead in the subsequent production competition. Thus, suggesting to such a person to organize a mutual aid group is like sowing specially selected seeds in the most fertile land, producing particularly good results. The Communist Party district committee proposed this suggestion. Following this, Han En immediately convened a mass meeting of Ba'an Tun, explaining to the farmers how to organize and become wealthy.

Despite Han En's enthusiasm and eloquence, this idea was initially not well promoted. One farmer said he had two cows and did not need mutual aid; he could manage the work alone. Others had concerns about land rights and feared that if the landlords returned, those who had joined the mutual aid organization would suffer endlessly. Still, others shrugged their shoulders at the mention of mutual aid, saying, "The heavens will not starve a blind sparrow," meaning, "If I need help, I can get it anytime."

Han En, undeterred by their opposition, visited each household and gradually persuaded some farmers to try this idea. Later, he organized three groups and got them started. Naturally, the results of their production made everyone amazed. After that, almost all the farmers joined the mutual aid cooperation movement.

When Han En promoted the mutual aid organization to success, each small cooperative unit had a fixed form. Groups did not exchange labor, and all work was completed within the group, regardless of whether the technology was sufficient or the personnel were lacking or excessive. This was more efficient than individual farming, but it had not yet reached the highest efficiency. For example, not every task required all the labor within the group. Some tasks might only need five laborers, but because the group had seven laborers, all seven were used to do the work. This was obviously a waste. Sometimes, this also had a bad effect because farmers in the same village, engaged in the same labor, received different remuneration due to the number of people in the group and the time spent, leading to dissatisfaction.

Han En studied the entire problem and came up with a new method of labor allocation. He suggested that the allocation should be based on the actual needs of the work. To achieve this goal, it was necessary to break the rigid form of the groups, allowing groups to exchange labor. The farmers of Ba'an Tun tried this new method and were very satisfied with the results. Based on their experience, they decided to continue using this "mutual aid group labor exchange system." In fact, this is a small-scale collective labor, which can more scientifically plan and lead work. The result? You may remember that I mentioned earlier that Ba'an Tun received a combined harrow-plow from the Northeast Agricultural Department, and "Poor Stick Village" became prosperous.

Thus, the farmers of Northeast China understood the importance of scientific cooperative methods and good labor organization. They saw how the most advanced cultivation methods achieved the highest efficiency, and how individual farmers, as members of mutual aid groups, fully exerted their creativity, and how this was of great significance for improving their lives.

Labor Models and Party Members

When analyzing the achievements in the rural areas of Northeast China, it is not easy to adequately estimate the importance of labor models and party members. They have had a profound impact on every aspect of rural life. All the factors mentioned earlier—land reform, new tools, mutual aid cooperation, production, and living standards—all of this is possible because there are such farmers who can mobilize the masses to take action, set examples for other farmers to learn from and follow. Such people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and our people's government, have been cultivated into self-sacrificing cadres. Whether men or women, they regard the revolutionary cause as above all else. They look at their current achievements and see the future cause. They want to build an agricultural base for the industrialization of China, so that the Chinese people can enjoy the joy of socialism.

From the cadres of Northeast China, I saw some outstanding characteristics. Perhaps it is best to express this through one of the advanced figures among them, such as the well-known Comrade Han En, using his words. In his words, "A good cadre, first, should not let the farmers see fear. Second, he must let the farmers believe his words. Third, he must truly work for the farmers. To lead the production work well, he must personally participate in the mutual aid group and prove that he works better than anyone else."

Han En is someone we can learn from. His remarks about cadres are worth our repeated consideration. I say this not only because he successfully established mutual aid groups and was selected as a representative to the National Labor Model Conference. I say this based on the opinions of the villagers of Ba'an Tun about him.

Someone said, "Han En is the kind of person who would not let you cross an unreliable bridge." Another said, "Everyone is willing to get rich under his leadership." Another person told us, "Han En knows how to hold democratic meetings. He discusses everything with the masses and never gives long speeches to the masses first. He is good at speaking last, summarizing all the opinions of the farmers, pointing out the correct ones, and explaining why the wrong ones are wrong. Finally, he makes an action plan. Because Han En's views contain the best opinions of the village, it often becomes the resolution of our meeting."

The words people say are indeed the most precious evaluation of cadre work. In this regard, we can be sure that people appreciate Han En's work. Generally speaking, he can be said to represent the labor models, Communist Party members, and Youth League members we encountered in Northeast China. They are all highly conscious people who can quickly accept new things and new work methods, think deeply, and include them in their plans. They can carefully and patiently explain everything to their comrades in work, and lead in both learning and work. No wonder a farmer said, "We can foresee that our plans will never fail."

The people are grateful for such leadership. I still remember the words of an old farmer in Yonggui Village. His name is Feng Wanshan. First, he recounted his life's hardships and the benefits of liberation for him and his family. Finally, his conclusion was: "I have lived this long and have never seen such good days. I am determined to contribute every bit of my strength to improve the next harvest and collect as much grain as possible. This is my contribution to the economic construction of New China. This is how I repay Chairman Mao and the People's Republic of China."

These words can be said to praise the leadership of Northeast China, praise the labor models, the Communist Party, the Youth League, and the government cadres who work for the people.

Government Care in Times of Disaster

Another reason why the people of Northeast China are fully devoted to production work is that they know that in times of disaster, the government will take care of them. In the past, the government has proven that it is united with the people in such times.

During our trip to Northeast China, we found several such examples. To name one, the revival of Hujiadianzi, a village outside Changchun.

This village was almost erased from the map during the Manchukuo and Nationalist regimes, with over 500 houses destroyed. At the time of liberation, the remaining property was only seven skinny cows, some livestock, and a broken cart. The farmers had no clothes to wear and were starving to the point of death.

As soon as liberation came, the people's government quickly sent 30,000 jin of relief grain to the village farmers and lent them 65 head of livestock. Later, the village also carried out land reform.

What happened to Hujiadianzi afterwards? Although in the autumn of 1949, grain was still scarce during the harvest, every farmer had a set of winter cotton clothes. By 1950, all the houses were rebuilt, and at this time, their livestock totaled: 141 mules and donkeys, 20 cows, 600 pigs. In addition, the village had 61 large carts. The grain supply was constantly increasing, and by 1951, everyone in the village had a new set of clothes.

There is another example. Due to the development of our country not yet being able to control natural disasters, natural disasters sometimes still strike our farmers. Minhe Village in the fifth district of Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, is an example.

When we looked at it, the streets of this rural village were colorful, with golden corn and bright red peppers hanging from the eaves of the houses, and piles of firewood stacked by the roadside. This constituted a pleasant scene. But not long ago, the farmers of Minhe Village were not so happy. In 1947, they suffered from a drought. The following year, after recovering some strength, they were hit by a hailstorm, seriously damaging their crops. The production was only 30% of the average. Therefore, by the summer weeding of 1950, the village was already short of grain and livestock feed. However, the government was closely monitoring this situation, and it came to take care of the people of Minhe Village. The government, through the village's consumer cooperative, allocated 66,540 jin of grain for the farmers to dispose of. The farmers themselves organized a rural credit committee to investigate and distribute these grains. With such help, Minhe Village overcame a very difficult period, concentrated on production, and made the land's output reach the usual amount.

We saw that in Northeast China, the government also takes good care of military dependents and families of martyrs. They have their own houses, enough grain, new clothes, and livestock. Because the economic level of the village has improved, the status of these military and martyr families has also improved. For example, Yonggui Village has 25 military families. Among them, 21 were hired laborers before the land reform. After the land reform, one family reached the rich peasant class, and the remaining 20 became middle peasants. The remaining four either maintained their original middle peasant status or improved to the rich peasant class. However, regardless of the family, if the labor force was insufficient due to enlistment or other difficulties arose, the government and the Communist Party would take care of them and solve the difficulties at any time.

Thus, the farmers of Northeast China feel that they can receive support from all sides, whether in normal times or in difficult times. This has a direct and vigorous influence on improving the production level.

Surplus Beyond Taxes and Expenses

In the rural areas of Northeast China, the most pleasant fact is that there are no signs of hunger, cold, or worry. On the contrary, what is usually seen is the radiant farmers and their families, dressed in new clothes—new fabric, new padding, and new lining. At the same time, you often hear farmers telling you that for the first time in their lives, they have surplus grain and other daily necessities in their hands, and they even have savings in the bank. This shows that the improvement in living standards is vividly presented to us, and the farmers, after paying taxes, purchasing daily necessities, and feeding livestock, still have their own wealth. This proves that while the farmers are working for New China, they are also working for themselves.

After the autumn harvest of 1950, due to the fair trading policies of cooperatives and state-owned trading organizations, it is estimated that the grain left in the hands of farmers reached 400 million jin. This is double the surplus of 1949. In addition, it is reported that the amount of savings in Northeast China in 1950 increased by 7.5 times compared to 1949, including the savings of farmers. All of this shows that the purchasing power of farmers and their families is rapidly increasing. According to the preliminary estimates of the Northeast Cooperative Union, the situation in 1951 will increase by 60% compared to 1950.

How farmers use their surplus to buy cloth is quite interesting. In 1949, they bought 40 million pieces. By 1950, the total sales of cloth jumped by 125%, reaching 90.2 million pieces. Not only that, but the farmers' purchasing habits have also changed.

Now, in Northeast China, they no longer just want cloth. In the past, blue and black cloth were fine; as long as it was cloth, it was fine. But now, farmers feel they are prosperous. They also want to dress up, so they start to pay attention to patterns and colors.

One farmer said, "Color is life. We have just begun to understand what life is."

It is obvious that the increase in purchasing power has greatly stimulated agricultural production. It is also obvious that this situation has greatly stimulated industrial production. The farmers' demands have gone beyond their personal needs. For example, the economic institutions of the Northeast government have ordered tens of thousands of agricultural tools to meet the needs of farmers. The demand for all items is increasing, which requires focusing on consumer cooperatives. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the tasks of consumer cooperatives in agricultural economics.

The Task of Consumer Cooperatives

Manager Liu Yinglan of Minhe Village Cooperative said, "Cooperatives must rely on the needs and intentions of the masses because they are all connected to production."

This is a lesson learned from experience. However, Liu Yinglan and other cooperative managers worked hard to understand this truth because before liberation, they had never come into contact with such institutions. Many cooperatives, at the beginning, were only to quickly sell goods, existed for a short period, and the purpose was only to make a profit. They sold goods that were superstitions, cosmetics, and other luxuries. Some cooperatives even had no capital. Farmers only pooled the fruits they had divided from the landlords. They felt that this money was unexpectedly obtained, so it could be used as a kind of "gambling" investment for cooperatives. This shows that they had no correct understanding of cooperatives and therefore had no relationship with them. Cooperatives were seen by them as just a fleeting thing. Some farmers thought that by becoming a member of the cooperative, they did not need to pay in cash when buying things, which was like a kind of family debt and could be deferred for a while.

Only after the Communist Party and the district cooperative bureau conducted education and assistance did these misunderstandings disappear. The leaders of the district cooperative bureau had to start from the first lesson of the cooperative course, teaching the responsibilities of the cooperative board of directors, how to hold meetings, what to discuss and vote on in the meetings, and how to check accounts, etc.

After such assistance, cooperatives in various places began to stock farmers' basic necessities. This aroused the farmers' interest, and they began to participate in large numbers. At the same time, managers began to understand that cooperatives are not just stores but the center for solving production and living problems. In this way, farmers truly participated voluntarily, and now there are almost no farmers in the countryside who do not join the cooperative.

We can take the Minhe Village Cooperative as an example to see how this was accomplished.

This cooperative has been completely rebuilt. After they understood the correct working principles, they began to sell shares and allowed poor peasants to pay in installments. Responsible staff were elected, regular meetings and auditing and supervision systems were established. Staff working in the cooperative could be lent labor to replace them in farming and be provided with clothes and meals according to the monthly budget. All of this is teaching modern management methods to farmers. At the same time, this also provides another lesson in democratic management because, in fact, the entire village participated in the decisions of the cooperative.

After these reforms, the Minhe Village Cooperative developed rapidly. It finally took on the responsibility of purchasing and selling farmers' products. This saved farmers a lot of trouble, and the results were very satisfactory, consolidating farmers' confidence in the cooperative. In addition, the cooperative also made money. At the June settlement of 1950, the shareholders received a 25% dividend.

Due to Liu Yinglan's good management, the Minhe Village Cooperative began to completely integrate with the life and economy of the entire village. For example, in the spring of 1950, there was a shortage of seeds for spring plowing. Liu Yinglan immediately convened a board meeting. They calculated the seeds needed. They sold some of the inventory, bought seeds, and then distributed them on a short-term loan basis with favorable terms. This ensured that sowing was completed on time.

The cooperative also helped the farmers of Minhe Village in other ways, such as investigating their needs in advance, purchasing suitable agricultural tools, or lending grain before harvest to guarantee the harvest, because farmers often had to eat unripe crops due to a lack of grain.

Due to the absolute support of the people, the Minhe Village Cooperative took another step forward. In addition to the original business, it began to participate in the rural economy as a financial institution. It established a savings and loan department. On the one hand, it supplied the needs of farmers, and on the other hand, through this new department, it helped farmers lend their surplus grain and money, earning interest. This will have the effect of encouraging production, and production will stimulate trade, thus using the strength of the village to solve the economic difficulties of the village.

This is a new method, a mass credit organization. Under the supervision and protection of a larger financial institution—the People's Bank of Northeast China—it makes the originally stagnant funds active. It is also due to the leadership of Communist Party members, who store their grain and money in the cooperative, that this deposit and loan department solves various problems that would otherwise hinder production—including some personal problems—so far, this organization has achieved initial success.

Therefore, after adding banking business, consumer cooperatives have further tightened their ties with the people. Their contribution to the reconstruction of the rural economy and to New China has also increased.

In the lives of farmers in Northeast China, cooperatives have become a great force. In 1950, the number of cooperative members increased by 127%. Their retail trade increased by 494%, exceeding the original plan by 25.8%. Their purchase amount increased by 394% compared to 1949, exceeding the original plan by 7.4%. From these figures, we can see that consumer cooperatives not only help farmers but are also a major factor in the exchange between urban and rural areas, a basic factor in the reconstruction of our country.

Rural Politics and Progress

Land reform has changed the basic economic situation, paving the way for farmers in the rural areas of Northeast China to change the entire political environment and political institutions. The freedom of the masses has replaced the oppression they once suffered. The power of the masses has replaced the tyranny once concentrated in the hands of landlords and their henchmen. These changes, compared to the progress in production, are not only not inferior but also have an inseparable connection with them.

In this regard, the most prominent example is perhaps the extensive participation in rural political life. Except for the former landlords, all classes actively participated in the management of the government. Most villages are divided into several sections, each with several households. These sections nominate candidates when electing the village people's representative assembly. After the election, the representative assembly elects a smaller committee.

The village committee is the grassroots level for the government to promote work. The committee has clear divisions of labor, with each member responsible for a department. Although the situation in each village is different, the village committee usually has the following departments: the village head office, the deputy village head office, the civil affairs office, the people's court or mediation office, the production office, and the militia, public security, education, health, and grain and finance departments. Usually, the village committee also has one secretary.

The village people's representative assembly generally holds three meetings a year, and more frequent meetings are held when necessary. To solve a problem, special meetings are often convened to mobilize farmers. For example, in September 1950, many village people's representative assemblies held expanded general meetings to plan effective wheat harvesting. From these mass meetings, a wheat harvesting committee was formed, responsible for harvesting, work inspection, accounting, storage, transportation, and other work.

Specific plans for each season and year are also formulated by convening people's representative assemblies. These assemblies review the progress of the already determined plans and report the results directly to the villagers. Other meetings are also convened to exchange production and administrative experience, to reward, criticize, and punish production work.

In the village government, the most precious weapon of criticism and self-criticism has been greatly developed. Many shortcomings and deviations from government policies have been discovered through this. For example, in some villages, some farmers were deprived of their political rights due to incorrect class composition. In other cases, the policy of protecting middle peasants was abused, allowing landlords to escape the judgment of the people. These two errors, as well as many other errors, have been severely attacked and corrected through criticism and self-criticism.

The village government representative assembly elects district representatives, and the district representatives elect the county government. This election goes up to the provincial government. The main characteristic of each level of government is to consult with the masses on every matter. This method has produced the most satisfactory results, not only in domestic and local issues but also in international issues. For example, farmers have a clear understanding of the struggle for a peaceful world and demand to participate in this struggle. Just take the results of two villages as an example: 80% of the farmers in Yonggui Village signed the Stockholm Peace Declaration. In Minhe Village, out of 1,470 people, 110 signed in support of peace.

Each village has its own armed forces, organized by the farmers themselves and managed through the village committee. Both men and women participate in the militia. The tasks of the militia are to protect the harvest and fields, prevent fires, prevent the plots of landlords, prevent the sabotage of imperialist spies and Nationalist remnants.

Another manifestation of the political development of farmers in Northeast China is their voluntary enlistment in the People's Liberation Army. Tens of thousands of farmers have already enlisted. It is hard to find a village in all of Northeast China that does not have someone in the Liberation Army.

Since production and politics cannot be separated, Communist Party members and Youth League members naturally cannot be separated from production and politics. In both of these aspects, it is these progressive elements who contribute the most, make the greatest sacrifices, and give the strictest self-criticism. Although their proportion in the rural population is small, their influence is enormous.

I have already explained how the masses of farmers in Northeast China follow their leaders and how grateful they are for this leadership. Now I would like to tell a story to illustrate the farmers' appreciation for this leadership in Northeast China.

Before liberation, it was customary to name villages after the largest and most powerful landlord. Now this custom has changed. Today's villages are named after people's heroes.

In this report, I have repeatedly mentioned the name Yonggui Village. In the past, there was a man named Man Yonggui. From the age of 12, he worked as a farmhand. However, in his early years, he knew that one day his life would be better than what he had experienced. Yonggui was a good investigator, and he finally found a way out under the leadership of the Communist Party. Before the liberation of his village, he organized the farmers. After liberation, he was elected chairman of the Farmers' Association. As chairman, he led the struggle against the landlords and reclaimed wasteland, ensuring that the poor had food to eat.

Mǎn Yǒnguì worked tirelessly for his village, encouraging farmers to increase production and combining this effort with the struggle to eradicate feudal forces from all aspects of their lives. He became one of the village leaders and later a leading figure in the entire district. At that time, he joined the Communist Party.

This selfless individual lived a very frugal life and worked extremely hard during his tenure as district magistrate and chairman of the local farmers' association. During the harvest season, he fell ill. However, Mǎn Yǒnguì refused to take leave. He worked and worked, overcoming fatigue and the pain of his illness. His condition worsened, and eventually, his spirit could no longer hold out. He finally passed away after dedicating everything to the people.

Later, at a mass meeting, farmers Liu Jīnshān and Yáng Kūn, along with a few others, proposed a motion. The minutes recorded their words: "Our village is called Huangyou Village. In the past, landlords had the power to oppress us. After the Communist Party came, our former district magistrate, Mǎn Yǒnguì, led us to eliminate feudalism and laid the foundation for our prosperity. It was he who led us on the path to liberation. He was one of us, and we must find a way to commemorate him. Therefore, we propose to rename Huangyou Village as Yǒnguì Village to commemorate our dear comrade Mǎn Yǒnguì." This proposal was unanimously approved by all the villagers because they respected Mǎn Yǒnguì himself and the party he represented.

Another manifestation of the political progress of the Northeast farmers is the improvement of the status of women in rural areas. In all aspects of life, they now actively participate. The labor they contribute in production earns them the same honor and rewards as men. In the village committee, the number of women representatives, as seen in Yǒnguì Village, reaches 45% of the total number of committee members. They hold responsible positions in economics, culture, and health. We see that the general Northeast women have become a new type of Chinese person, washing away all feudal remnants, helping their men and elders with the same efforts.

Folk Welfare and Cultural Advancement

From this, we see that land reform has changed the economic and political life of the Northeast countryside. Naturally, this change is also reflected in the folk welfare and cultural activities of the countryside.

In the field of health, there has been significant progress. Many villages have three annual campaigns to prevent typhoid, cholera, and plague, and one campaign to prevent smallpox. All these vaccinations are free, and in most villages, these health services alone are already 100% more than the medical care the people had in the past. Because during the Japanese imperialist and Kuomintang era, villagers were completely cut off from modern medicine.

All this medical work is carried out by the clinics in each district. These clinics provide free treatment and only charge a nominal fee in special cases. In addition, many places have farmers' medical cooperatives. These cooperatives supply medicine at low prices and assist in promoting general medical work in the countryside. In Sōngjiāng Province, there are already 100 such cooperatives in operation.

The problem of midwives in the countryside has also been well handled. They must undergo training in modern delivery methods at the district clinics before they can practice. Thus, old-style midwives are retrained, and new midwives start with correct training.

In most villages, the practice is to allow women to rest for a month after childbirth. During this time, they are specially provided with rice, flour, eggs, and sugar.

The training of midwives and the special care for women after childbirth have resulted in a significant reduction in the infant mortality rate. For example, in Yǒnguì Village, in 1950, there were a total of 44 births, with only 3 deaths. Compared to the past, such a mortality rate is almost negligible. Now, Yǒnguì Village and the entire district's health authorities are striving to reduce the infant mortality rate to the lowest possible level. To this end, they plan to provide more care for infants and continue to insist that all midwives must follow the regulations, and they are not allowed to deliver without basic equipment such as scissors and alcohol swabs.

Regarding other medical workers, the Northeast health authorities allow traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to continue practicing but often encourage them to acquire more medical knowledge and training. At the same time, when there are more qualified medical personnel available, they are sent to serve the farmers.

We see that farmers generally accept health guidance and apply it to their daily lives and cooking. Therefore, the overall standard of health has also been significantly improved. The people of Northeast China have become robust men and women, full of energy and vitality.

In cultural activities, there has also been similar progress. In the past, almost all villagers were illiterate. Writing a letter was an unheard-of thing, and if it happened, it was a major event. Writing or reading a letter was a big deal. Now, almost every village in the Northeast has its own primary school, serving the children of farmers and the farmers themselves. Last year, 2,673 such schools were newly built.

The farmers of Hújiādiànzi, when they rebuilt their village from the ruins, also built a school they had never had before. 70% of school-age children are enrolled, and this number is increasing year by year. In fact, almost all school-age children in the entire Northeast can now receive their due education.

As in all other villages, the adults of Hújiādiànzi also make great use of the village school. During the winter school period, 700 adults registered, including 300 women. A few adults who could not even write their own names can now recognize 1,000 characters. Most farmers can also do simple calculations and writing. The progress of children is even more remarkable, with some already in higher primary or middle school.

The situation in Yǒnguì Village is the same. 100% of the children are already enrolled in school. Equally important, the enrollment age has been raised to 17 at the request of the farmer masses, so that more people can benefit from the school. Those over 17 years old attend winter school.

From these examples, we can see that the farmers of the Northeast have been liberated in their minds, and they thirst for knowledge and culture. This is an era of enlightenment and progress. With the advancement of this era, old and obstructive customs in life and thought will be sharply struck. The most important example is that old superstitions have lost their control over the people. In Yǒnguì Village, we see that the custom of worshipping various gods and Buddhas has been completely abolished. Especially, no one spends money to buy incense and other superstitious items, and no one wastes time worshipping idols during the New Year. The farmers of the Northeast have sent all these things to where they should go—they have sent them to history books and museums. They realize that there is only one power, and that is the power of the people. This is the progress of our Northeast farmers.

Cities and Construction

On the basis of the continuous increase in agricultural production in the countryside, the cities of the Northeast are rapidly developing into the base of New China. Because relatively modern industries are concentrated in these cities located in the richest resource areas of our country. From this base of heavy industry with steel plants, power plants, and machine tool factories, one can see the true importance of the Northeast. When you see the new masters of China—the industrial working class that has risen up—working, overcoming difficulties, and using the power of the Northeast factories, you will understand that nothing can stop the Chinese people from realizing their beautiful ideal of industrialization.

The history of the Northeast factories in this recent period is a history of reform and transformation. It had to transform the colonial nature under the rule of the Japanese invaders into first supporting the War of Liberation, and then improving the livelihood of the people, and helping the cities to rebuild the rural economy.

It had to be rebuilt from the destruction caused by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, which was done when they saw their schemes failing. According to the words of Vice Chairman Gāo Chōngmín of the Northeast People's Government, during the period of Kuomintang rule alone, 50% to 70% of the machinery and equipment were destroyed, and technical personnel were attacked and killed, threatening them to disperse. Not a single large railway bridge was intact.

Due to the increase in production after land reform and the reliance on the working class in the cities, the industrial output of the Northeast has gradually recovered and is on the road to reconstruction and development. The industrial output of the Northeast not only completed the tasks for the People's Liberation Army and farmers but also accumulated funds for economic construction and accumulated experience for large-scale production. Since 1949, it has been continuously leaping forward. In 1950 alone, the total investment of the Northeast People's Government in industrial construction accounted for 40% of the budget, exceeding the plan by 3.6%. This investment expanded the industrial equipment from 10% to 60%, and in some individual factories, it even expanded to 800%. In 1950, the total area of newly built or repaired factory buildings and warehouses reached 870,000 square meters. At the same time, workers' housing, hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, clubs, and other facilities increased by 1,560,000 square meters in area.

In 1950, the total production value of state-owned factories was 117.3% of that in 1949, the number of workers in the Northeast increased by 35.2%. At the same time, the purchasing power of the urban population increased by 20.5% compared to 1949, which further stimulated the development of trade and industry.

The People's Factories

In this report, I only intend to talk about a few state-owned factories in the Northeast and share the impressions I gained during the investigation.

The Harbin Railway Repair Factory has a history of 47 years and now has 19 branch factories in addition to the main factory. The constant work of the entire factory is to repair and inspect vehicles. They not only completed the assigned tasks and often exceeded the plan but also modified many locomotives from the scrap heap, with a few of them famous for their durability. One of them is named after Vice Chairman Zhu De.

In addition, the Harbin Factory also responded to the needs of the state and did some extra work. In fact, these extra tasks exceeded one-third of the regular work. For example, when the new bridges of the Jiūmùsī River, Sōnghuā River, and Lālín River were replaced, the factory took on the task of manufacturing bridge steel frames. This task required the installation of a three-ton electric furnace for steelmaking. Workers, technicians, and engineers worked for five days and five nights in a row, completing the task a few days ahead of schedule. Later, the Harbin Factory also completed an 80-ton double-arm bridge machine, which will be of great help to the country in the future for building bridges.

To say that the Xiaofēngmàn Power Plant was built with the blood and sweat of the Chinese people is not an exaggeration. The Japanese started construction in 1943, forcing thousands of workers to work and cruelly oppressing them. As a result, by 1945, only 29% of the work was completed. But the price paid for this work was very heavy, with an estimated 10,000 Chinese workers dying.

Just before liberation, the Kuomintang sent a team of soldiers to destroy the power plant. But due to the cleverness of the workers, these bandits were only able to destroy some unimportant parts and preserved the main equipment.

After liberation, the workers raised the slogan "Do not let the power supply stop." To fulfill this slogan, workers and cadres have been working non-stop, repairing machines, rebuilding embankments, and maintaining a record of "no major accidents." Now, Xiaofēngmàn is generating electricity for the people and for New China.

In the Northeast, the oldest and most famous industry is probably the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. According to our understanding, as early as 1,300 years ago, the Koreans were already smelting iron in Anshan. At that time, the Kingdom of Gōguryeo occupied today's Liaodong Peninsula.

In 1933, the Japanese invaders seized the factory that had already grown in Anshan, expanded its equipment and production to serve the purposes of imperialism. However, they did not use machines but manual labor because exploiting Chinese workers was cheaper. Therefore, they employed as many as 170,000 workers.

When the Kuomintang took over the factory in 1946, it had suffered serious damage. However, they managed to restore one blast furnace to produce steel and employed about 10,000 workers. But by February 1948, when it was liberated, most of the workers had been dismissed.

The People's Government began to restore this injured giant. Cadres called workers back, using the active elements who had retreated with the People's Liberation Army or organized to stay behind to protect the factory as the basic force. From this group of people, a high degree of work enthusiasm was generated, resulting in many amazing achievements, including increasing steel production to 136% of the original plan.

Now, many of the most complex tasks in the factory are undertaken by Chinese technicians and engineers, which were previously considered the exclusive domain of the Japanese.

When we toured this vast steel plant, the organized social production gave me endless excitement, making me speechless. I couldn't help but envision the future of the Chinese people, as strong as steel.

I saw the hardworking steelworkers hammering the giant blast furnace. Through specially made glasses, I saw the steelmaking process. The cranes moved loudly overhead, and the sharp whistle drowned out all other sounds. The train roared like thunder. When the blast furnace door opened, it emitted a dazzling light, reminding me of the story of the Cyclops in Greek mythology. Steel poured from the giant bucket, spraying huge sparks, illuminating the sky. I couldn't help but think, "This is the vitality of China."

The visit to Anshan also gave me other thoughts. Many times, I heard people say that China needs foreign technicians and cannot do anything on its own. Of course, in the situation where our industry is not yet developed, we do need technical help. But once this problem is considered, the solution also comes to mind. This sentence is said very calmly and with firm confidence. Anshan Iron and Steel Plant Manager Wēn Liángxián, who was previously an ironworker from the old liberated area, said: "As long as we fully rely on the workers and learn humbly, I believe we can manage modern factories well."

When I left the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, I had no doubt that there would be a day when Chinese workers could fully manage this factory on their own, just as they would be able to fully manage many similar factories that New China will establish.

I can continue to describe the history and situation of the Jílín Paper Mill, the Dàlián Shipyard, and other industries, but the above examples are sufficient to show that the industry in the Northeast is thriving, and workers are managing the industry with the attitude of masters.

The Importance of Soviet Assistance

I have described the progress of the Northeast industry, but until now, I have not mentioned the role of Soviet technicians and workers in this progress. I did this intentionally. First, our Soviet friends have generously provided their experience, and the internationalism shown here deserves a whole chapter to be written in detail. Second, their role in our various production and construction projects is so great that it must be described in detail. Soviet technicians and workers brought to China a treasure trove of experience in solving various practical problems. They brought the application of the highest scientific knowledge, and they brought rich working experience for serving the people. Many of them participated in the construction work after the October Socialist Revolution. They have all worked bravely in the construction of socialism and the preparation for communism in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the situations and difficulties we encounter in China are exactly what they have encountered and overcome before. Their task and their greatest joy is to help the Chinese people use this experience to build New China.

In all places in the Northeast where there are Soviet technicians and workers, we always see them working closely with Chinese workers to promote the work. Our people call them "elder brothers." I remember when we visited the Harbin Repair Factory, the factory director Zhāng Hóngshù enthusiastically expressed his willingness to be a student to learn from the Soviet comrades. Deputy Director Kèlìjiěwǔ smiled and praised his partner's progress. This mutual respect is a universal phenomenon in Sino-Soviet cooperation.

The desire to learn from Soviet workers is undoubtedly mostly derived from their attitude towards work. In the Harbin Factory, we saw a Soviet worker named Bāoluójīn, who was selected as a labor model. He is a 75-year-old old man and the head of the hammer department. What he said to us can represent this attitude. He said: "Everyone has his friends. My friend is this hammer. The most important thing for a worker is to take care of his tools. Because if the tool malfunctions, we can only stop working. This is a loss to the country. So for so many years, I have always loved my hammer as if it were my best friend."

In addition to loving labor and the tools for enriching the people, one must also pay attention to precision and science in management and work. Chinese workers say: "Our Soviet comrades are serious about even the smallest details. They never start work without precise calculations."

In the Anshan Factory, there is an example. In September 1949, a plan was made to completely repair a large blast furnace by August 1950. However, after the Soviet technicians carefully examined the plan and the condition of the blast furnace, they suggested starting the repair immediately and estimated that it could be completed and used by the end of the year. The general old engineers were skeptical, but the Soviet technicians were confident. They had experience repairing in the much harsher climate of Siberia. With this confidence, the workers started working and completed the task a few days before the end of 1949.

The scientific application of the Soviet workers can be seen from an incident that occurred at the Xiaofēngmàn Power Plant.

An important task in rebuilding the power plant was to build the embankment and store water to generate electricity. This task was originally scheduled to be completed by 1951. However, the Soviet technicians who were sent to the plant suggested completing it by July 15, 1950. The reason was that according to meteorological observations, the rainfall in the autumn of 1950 would increase. If the embankment was not strengthened in preparation, it might suffer serious damage, resulting in the loss of all previous efforts.

This suggestion was accepted. In the autumn of that year, the Sōnghuā River was higher than in previous years, but the embankment had been repaired, and the work of the power plant continued as usual.

There are countless examples of international friends helping us. Their sincere concern for the living conditions, housing, medical care, and learning of workers is also incalculable.

When I write this, I am reminded of the sincerity of the Soviet friends, and of those self-sacrificing people like the harbor master of Dàlián Harbor, Novikov, whose only son died in the liberation of Berlin. We visited the simple and clean homes of a few such comrades and listened to their life stories. After I got to know them, I understood why they often broke production records. When I saw the efficiency of steelmaking increased by 35%, the time for coking coal reduced from 21 hours to 16.5 hours, and the coal production in the entire Northeast increased from 20% to 30% after adopting the Soviet method, I truly understood the efforts of the Soviet technicians working with Chinese comrades.

The New Workers of China

The Soviet science applied in industry is also applied to the management system of enterprises in the Northeast, thus establishing the "piecework" reasonable wage system. Under the leadership of the trade union and the Communist Party, this new system has sparked an important reform movement among the workers, resulting in a new type of Chinese worker who is the vanguard of the working class and only thinks of the progress of the country. Their role in the city is equivalent to that of the labor model in the countryside. They jointly promote the advancement of New China.

Let's take a factory as an example. Let me quote some figures from the Harbin Factory. On the honor roll of this factory, there is the name Páng Pǐshùn. This worker invented an iron mold, not only increasing the daily production from 350 units to 1,500 units but also improving the purity from 50% to 90%.

On the honor roll, if you look down, you will see the name Duān Shàngjiān. He invented two new methods, one about the rolling process, increasing efficiency by six times; the other is the iron hammer, saving the labor of 15 workers and increasing the production of the workshop by 280%.

In 1950, the entire Harbin Factory adopted 320 rationalization suggestions from workers. Due to these innovations, from January to September 1950 alone, 368,440,000 yuan was saved. Utilizing waste materials, another 526,000,000 yuan was saved. In addition, using scrap iron, a 1,000-square-meter office, a small hospital, a nursery, and a 2,000-square-meter new factory building were built. In the first half of 1950, the overall production of the factory increased by 30%; at the same time, due to the adoption of the Soviet management system and more scientific division of labor, the number of management personnel was greatly reduced.

All this explains why the Harbin Factory has 387 labor models, 64 labor heroes who have been commended, 658 excellent workers, and 398 advanced workers, all of whom are elected by the workers themselves. All this explains why 28 first-class cadres have been selected from the ranks of workshop directors or branch factory directors to move to more important tasks, and it explains that the current workshop directors and branch factory directors are promoted from the ranks of workers.

This is the liberated labor force following the example of learning from the Soviet Union. This atmosphere has produced workers like Zhào Guóyǒu and his new record-setting movement, which has spread to every department of the industry, creating 21,740 new records, with tens of thousands of workers participating individually and collectively in the movement.

The Impact on Private Industry

Land reform, the great revival of state-owned industry in the Northeast, and the enthusiasm of the workers have made the entire economy of the Northeast active. This also includes private industry. During the period of Japanese invasion and Kuomintang bandits, private industry either withered away on its own or was deliberately squeezed out of the market. The People's Government has completely turned the situation around. Private industry is encouraged to develop towards the countryside to seek revival, thus helping the economic construction of the countryside. The government helps industrialists in the following ways:

A: Solving the market problem for goods. Government agencies place orders for finished products with them or hand over semi-finished products to private factories for processing.

B: Solving the labor-management problem. The government encourages labor and management to sign contracts that take into account the interests of both parties and also encourages labor and management to establish production consultation committees. So far, experience has shown that this policy has increased production and promoted the movement to reduce waste among the workers of private industry in the Northeast.

C: The government provides planned assistance in obtaining raw materials, electricity, and capital.

D: The government has strengthened the work of the Northeast Industrial and Commercial Federation.

The implementation of these policies has resulted in the development of private industry, especially factories directly related to the national economy, such as machine manufacturing or steel plants. For example, in Shěnyáng, there were only 596 iron workshops in January 1950, but by mid-year, the number had increased to 1,014, and the number of workers doubled. In the same period, the investment in private industry in Shěnyáng increased from 946 billion yuan to 1,714 billion yuan. The total production value in the third quarter of that year increased by 23.1% compared to the first quarter. According to a recent report by Vice Chairman Gāo Gāng, overall, the private industry in Shěnyáng increased by 30.2% from December 1949 to November 1950, and the number of workers increased by 32.4%. Since this is the situation in the main industrial city of the Northeast, it can be seen that private industry in the entire Northeast is reviving along with the construction of state-owned industry under the government's policy of connecting urban and rural economies.

Cities and Political Progress

After the liberation of the cities in the Northeast, political transformation is needed. The previous grassroots government, the evil "Baojia system," was like a shackle on the neck of the people. Since the establishment of the district people's government, this burden has been permanently lifted because political responsibility has returned to the people. They participate in the election of their representatives through street and lane associations or other organizations. For the first time in the history of the cities in the Northeast, they have received instructions that are beneficial to the development of the masses.

The district government sends representatives to participate in the county-level people's congress. The county government is formed from these congresses. They convey the opinions of the masses, discuss and pass various laws, and elect officials.

Noteworthy in the development of these congresses is that the more frequent the congresses are held, the stronger the representation of the people becomes. The number of representatives increases, and the proportion of representatives from various sectors is gradually adjusted, thus accurately reflecting the composition of the population of a city. For example, in Chángchūn, the number of representatives at the first city-wide meeting was only 70, but by the fifth meeting, the number had increased to 310.

The work done by Communist Party members and members of the New Democratic Youth League in the cities is as important as in the countryside. In production, they often stand at the forefront without fear of sacrifice. For example, female Communist Party member Zhào Guìlán lost her arm while protecting a factory from an explosion in Dàlián.

The actions of party and league members are led by the instructions of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. These instructions are: to protect production tools well when accepting them, to overcome all difficulties to restore them, to use every penny for production, to train cadres, and finally, to strive for the economic revival and industrial construction of China.

Party members and members of the New Democratic Youth League also play a leading role in raising the political awareness of the people. As a result, the masses of the Northeast were the first in the country to express their anger at the bombing of our cities by American imperialism. They hold in their hands the fruits of victory in the new life, and the future development is completely in their hands. Therefore, they first warn the United States that we are determined to resist and defeat the imperialist attack on Korea, China, and world peace.

The cities in the Northeast stand firmly on this issue and play a leading role in the country, which is due to their rapid political development.

Welfare and Culture in the City

The most impressive thing about the development of the Northeast is the significant progress in the welfare, culture, and education of the urban working class.

The most closely related to the lives of workers are the safety and hygiene facilities in factories, mines, and textile mills. These have recently been expanded and improved. The example of the factories in Shěnyáng can illustrate these advances.

Although Shěnyáng has 204 state-owned and private factories, safety and hygiene work has not been well developed in the past. When the People's Government took action in this regard, it first took two factories as typical experiments and then gradually promoted the results of the experiments to other factories. In 1950, the factory safety and hygiene committee was established. With the assistance of the municipal government, as well as the cooperation of the labor bureau, health bureau, trade union, police, and medical experts, the work was carried out in depth in all public and private factories in Shěnyáng. During the work's progress, it aroused the interest of the entire laboring masses of the city, and the pursuit of safety and hygiene in the workplace became a constant movement.

The main task of the safety and hygiene committee is to study and improve machinery and delve into all issues related to safety and hygiene facilities. It also does statistical work, promotes safety education in the factory, and takes some measures to prevent accidental injuries.

Based on this, the committee, in order to understand the overall situation, went to various factories for a thorough inspection. At the same time, it began to conduct physical examinations of workers and adopted the health card system. In factories without clinics, clinics were established. When these works were in progress, the most important problem was also handled. That is: most factories had poor ventilation, insufficient lighting, high temperatures, heavy humidity, and dust and other hazards to workers' health. After these suggestions were made, they were tried in many factories, and after it was determined that the problem could be solved, it was gradually developed to other factories. In addition, the factory canteens, dining halls, dormitories, bathrooms, and toilets also underwent hygiene work. Those that did not have these welfare facilities were taking steps to install them as soon as possible.

Due to the adoption of a new responsibility system, safety measures were also strengthened. According to this system, groups of workers are responsible for a part of the machinery. This responsibility depends on the situation of each factory, sometimes even extending to the entire factory, textile mill, and mine. The responsibility of the workers is to eliminate defects that can cause accidents. The responsibility of the factory management is to ensure the replacement or repair of machine defects or take other actions to avoid danger. Labor and management signed contracts, detailing the responsibilities of both parties. In addition, a safety committee was established, and regular safety education campaigns were held. All new safety facilities were first discussed by the workers before being adopted. This system has achieved great success in the factories where it has been adopted.

The safety and hygiene work in large industrial cities is complex and must be carried out with care. Therefore, the safety and hygiene committee of the factories in Shěnyáng is carried out according to a clear plan, first concentrating on large factories to gain experience, and then promoting the work to small factories. The prospect of work is very great, and this entire plan shows that the People's Government recognizes the necessity of this work.

In other cities in the Northeast, the health facilities for workers have developed outside the factory premises. We visited a sanatorium for workers of the Dàlián Far East Power Company, which is one of the industrial equipment recently completed and handed over to us by the Soviet Union. The sanatorium is a modern building, standing on a hillside, facing the sea, surrounded by green pines, red maples, and cherry blossoms, with a very beautiful scenery. It was formerly a villa of the Japanese military, and now it belongs to the Chinese working people.

The funds for the sanatorium are paid from the labor insurance fund of the factory. Workers staying there, in addition to receiving their wages, also receive a daily allowance. Labor models, workers with good production records, and factory cadres come to this comfortable and pleasant environment to recuperate, enjoying delicious food and entertainment facilities. Every two weeks, 100 new workers use this opportunity to improve their health. After two weeks of residence, their weight all increased.

In the entire Northeast, such workers' health facilities have developed to several hundred hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums. This is a manifestation of the times. In this era, workers are the masters of their own country, and the new society allows them to walk towards a beautiful life everywhere.

To complete the production tasks undertaken by the Northeast and to generally improve the health of the people, public health plans are also given the same attention and care. Although health personnel and equipment are not sufficient, the workers of the Northeast have implemented the policy of "prevention first, treatment second." The success of this policy is due to the establishment of a cooperative approach between the government and the people, organizing medical personnel in the cities, and mobilizing the masses to participate in the health movement.

The main reliance is on the general people in the cities to promote it. For example, in Shěnyáng, 11,000 health workers have been trained. They take the lead in advocating the cleaning of garbage, the eradication of flies, and other sanitation work.

It is equally important to promote the implementation of the principle of "bringing medicine to the people" by medical personnel. Each health worker is responsible for a certain health work in his or her district.

Another major facility is the establishment of maternal and child health stations to reduce infant mortality and improve the welfare of women and children. Seeing this work, I am reminded of the work done by the China Welfare Association in Shanghai among women workers, carrying out health propaganda and education, training child care, prenatal and postnatal examinations, and midwifery.

When the health workers of the Northeast summarize their experience and lessons, they have the following points:

1. When carrying out large-scale health work, cooperation with the municipal government, the Communist Party, and public security organizations is necessary.

2. It is effective to train in advance when establishing grassroots health organizations, and it is necessary to mobilize grassroots personnel.

3. Participating doctors are the pillars of the health organization because they are the bridge between the health organization and grassroots activists.

4. Once the people understand the importance of health work, they will demand expansion and want to take charge of part of it themselves. However, guidance at all levels and constant encouragement are still necessary.

We find that the people in the cities of the Northeast have the same interest in child care as in other parts of China. They also understand that to cultivate the future of China, we must train our children from a young age. Many nurseries are in operation, and their number is constantly increasing. The funds for many nurseries come directly from the People's Government, trade unions, and women's organizations.

According to the results of the nursery work meeting, the staff of the Northeast's child care work set the following work goals:

1. Help children form a correct view of labor, so they understand that labor creates all wealth, so they should love labor.

2. Use interesting work plans to cultivate children's intelligence.

3. Help children develop new morality, that is, love our country, love our leaders, love our people, love labor, and protect the people's property.

4. Through the education of good habits and preventive work, help children maintain good health.

×          ×        ×

The progress in cultural and educational work in the Northeast shows how these works can be greatly developed after the people have political power.

Primary schools have now increased to 3,400, with 4,576,111 students. This number includes children in rural areas. Middle schools in 1950 exceeded 1949 by 21%, and the number of students increased by 38%, reaching 155,748. In addition, there are 61 vocational schools and many special speed-up schools for workers and peasants. There are 16 new-type higher education institutions in the Northeast for training technical workers, including financial and economic systems or courses. Currently, there are 17,978 students studying in these universities and colleges.

Accompanying the regular schools, there is a massive movement to eliminate illiteracy among the laboring people of the Northeast, with a total of 450,000 farmers participating in similar courses.

Naturally, all these educational works have created a demand for publications. In 1950, the Xinhua Bookstore printed more than 40 million new books. At the same time, the Northeast has established a far-reaching distribution network, selling books, magazines, newspapers, and other publications.

What is the result of this promotion of knowledge and education? Taking the Lǜdà District as an example. Before liberation, one-third of the population was illiterate. In 1949, when the illiteracy eradication movement began, 200,000 people signed up to study. Among them, 50,000 have graduated. The literacy standard for workers is to recognize 1,200 characters, 1,000 characters for general citizens, and 800 characters for farmers.

In the student population, the number of middle school students increased by 266.5% compared to the Japanese occupation period, and the number of primary school students increased by 217.9%. At the same time, these cities have universities with complete courses. There are also vocational schools set up directly in the factory workshops. Workers have a cultural palace, nine cultural halls, 92 cultural clubs, and 332 cultural stations.

The "Workers' Home" we visited in Dàlián is a typical cultural institution. In fact, this is the home, school, and cultural palace of the workers of the Dàlián Transportation Company. Among these workers, half are women.

The slogan of this company is "The factory is a school." This spirit of continuous improvement is also spread to their "Workers' Home." The work is divided into three shifts, so this "home" is full of young people day and night. They study part-time there and their vocational school. They proudly tell you that the manager of the Dàlián Transportation Company and the principal of the school are both graduates of the "Workers' Home," both promoted from the ranks of workers.

The "Workers' Home" is established with the profits of the cooperative. They bought an old and dilapidated school and, with their voluntary labor, turned it into a palace. There are a lounge, an entertainment room, a sports field, a library, a classroom, a bathroom, and a dining room, and there is a hall that can accommodate 800 people.

We saw many such cultural institutions in the Northeast and also visited the Oriental Cultural Museum and the War History Museum in Lǔshùn. In every place, workers are either actually participating in part of the construction project or the entire project, or they are operating the institution. In every place, we see the people of New China learning and enjoying a life that they could not even dream of a few years ago. This life makes them more eager to contribute to the growth and prosperity of their motherland, and they are determined to defend it with all their courage and love.

Conclusion

Let me summarize the main impressions I gained from the Northeast:

Imperialism, bureaucratic capital, warlordism, and the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang have been completely destroyed. In their place, a true people's government has risen.

This has made it possible to complete and consolidate land reform. The farmers of the Northeast will never return to the days of oppression, feudalism, and poverty. They have embarked on the road of collective effort and the new democratic road leading to the socialist era.

This has liberated the creative abilities of the urban working class. With the help of Soviet experts in the true spirit of internationalism, they are rapidly rebuilding industry, laying the foundation for its future development in the new democratic era—the new democratic era is the preparatory period for the industrialization of a fully organized, highly efficient socialist era.

This has enabled farmers and workers to enjoy a continuously improving standard of living, benefiting materially and making significant cultural progress. Our sensitive and creative people are being transformed into new democratic citizens and are gradually becoming the advanced people of the socialist era.

The Northeast has proven that New China is indeed advancing towards its bright future.

　　新中国向前迈进  
    ——东北旅行印象记——
      宋庆龄
    最近我同林伯渠同志和另一些同志到新中国的东北作了一次视察。我们旅行了整个东北，深入地接触到人民生活中所起的各种变化。我们所经历的，是这样地感动了我，使得我要将我的印象向全国和全世界报道，也就是报道正在铸造中的新中国的前途，而我们的东北正走在这个铸造过程的前头。
    这里并不企图给东北做一个全面的，详尽的分析。这里毋宁是简单地概括了我们在东北境内行经四千二百六十公里的时候，给我印象最深刻的一些景象和题材。我们访问了五十四个不同的地区和工程，其中包含东北的七个主要城市，还有四个完成了土地改革的村子。我们视察了十一个工厂，一个矿场，数不清楚的福利事业和文化机构。在每一个地方，我们都听取了口头报告，或者拿到了书面报告。此外，我们还进行个别访问，跟一般的农民、工人、工厂和政府的行政负责人等进行谈话。
    这样，我们就能够对东北的巨大跃进作一个深刻、实在、而又全面的研究了。
    我们在土地改革后的农民生活中，看到经济生活的巨大改善，文化活动的提高和卫生条件的改进。我们看到这一些进展如何良好地影响了城市工人阶级的生活，他们在从事工业恢复和重建时，具有何等的热情。我们也目击了我们的政府和中国共产党在多么彻底地工作着，他们怎样改正错误以寻求真理，他们怎样充分地认识工农无产阶级的力量，他们又怎样动员这一个力量，走向更大的成就。
  农村和土地改革
    当解放战争在东北进行到战斗最剧烈的阶段时，土地改革就已经开始了。事实上，正是在这个国民党势力登峰造极，而人民的军队正在作战略撤退的时候——，从一九四六年的七月到十二月——一万二千干部被派遣到乡村中去，担任这项工作。他们的任务是发动反对封建和土匪分子的斗争，建立起根据地来为了使革命能在整个地区里巩固起来。
    这不是一件容易的事，因为反动势力很顽强。可是农民群众却逐渐地领会了土地改革运动的重要，到一九四七年底，敌人便在农村生活的社会经济方面遭受了失败，正如他们在战场上，同样地开始一败涂地了。到一九四八年底，东北境内国民党匪军残余已完全肃清，十个省份全部解放。于是道路已被铺平，可以巩固土地改革和随之而来的新的生活了。
    东北农民对于这个新的生活表现了他们的热烈情绪，他们在一九四九年农产量的总额达到了一千四百五十万吨粮食（副产品两百万吨尚不在内）。一九五○年生产了约一千八百万吨。一九五○年的产量达到了一九四三年——日本帝国主义统治下产量最高的一年的百分之九十三。可是每公顷的平均产量已大大超过了一九四三年的，而且在某些地区，例如黑龙江的白城县，则生产率达到了一九四三年的数字。
    照我的观察，农业产量这种空前激涨是由于下列原因：
    甲、现在农民已是土地的主人。
    乙、耕种方法改良了。
    丙、农业劳动力组织得好。
    丁、模范工作者，共产党员和青年团员做了榜样。
    戊、政府在人民遇到灾难时予以照顾。
    己、除去公粮和开支外，尚有多余的款项和谷物，鼓舞了农民扩大生产。
    我愿意将这些原因每一个都略加分析。
  农民是土地的主人
    当你走进一个土地改革已早成为一个被接受了事实的农村时，你立刻能够从人民的脸上，从那富有自信的表情和他们的昂首挺立的姿态上，看出这一点来。处处看得出他们对生活的新态度。整个的气氛是充满了意义的。村子里忙碌得很，农民和他们的家属不是在工作，便是在学习。房屋和街坊都清洁整齐。这一切都导源于一个事实，那就是，农民可以手指着田地，怡然自得地对你说：“这是我的”。你看，这样重要的一个消息，却可以用这样简单的方式就表达出来了。
    用图表可以更明显地表达这同样的情况。我们访问过的村中有一个永贵村。它属于松江省呼兰县，从下列数字中我们可以了解它近几年的历史：
        土地改革前后各阶层所有资产表在土地改革前阶层   人口  土地   房屋       马        车辆
      （百分比）  （垧）（百分比）  （百分比）  （百分比）  （百分比）雇农  383  41.9%贫农  117  17.3%    0.4    0.6%     14

     21
    从这表，你能看出，永贵村里的土地确已属于耕者所有。结果是一九四九年的生产与土地改革前相比较，平均每垧（注二）增加一担。在东北，我们所经过的每个地方都找得到同样情形和同样结果。
    （注一）在土地改革中及土地改革后有新户迁入该村。
    （注二）当地习惯一“小”垧平均等于十亩，一亩约等于六分之一英亩。
  耕种方法的改进
    随着土地改革基本步骤的完成，第二步便着手改进生产方法。这就是，除了荒地的垦殖和农田的灌溉之外，长期耕种、季节耕种和日常工作之设法提高到科学化的水准。这在东北业已成为一个普遍展开的运动。深耕细作，大量施肥，随种随耙，平作的采用和其他许多新法，现在都已成为标准的耕种步骤。东北农民们并且喜欢使用现代化的农具，选择种子，用科学方法保护牲畜。在我们所访问的一个农村有一些例子就可以说明为什么出现这种把科学应用到农业上的群众运动。
    保安屯是吉林省蛟河县的一个村子。在东北解放以前，它向以贫乏著称。现在它，不仅因它的富庶，而且因它的卓越的耕种技术而遐迩闻名了。下面是关于保安屯的一些统计数字：
    一九四七年它有三十头牲口。
    一九五○年它有四十二头牲口。
    一九四七年它用着十副农具。
    一九五○年它用着二十七副（包含洋犁和东北农业部奖给的联合铲鋿机）。
    一九四七年它种地三十八点八垧。
    一九五○年它种地五十三点○六垧。
    一九四七年它施肥的土地占百分之六十六。
    一九五○年它施肥的土地占百分之九十点五。
    一九四七年它的生产总额是二百四十担。
    一九五○年它的生产总额是七百担。
    从以上所列举的，我们看到新式耕种方法和新农具已经给东北农民证明它们是大大增加产量的。我们还可以从保安屯农民所举的一个具体事实的例子来看一看。
    农民老张和他的邻居叶金比了比他们的小米收成。使他愤懑的是他仅仅收获了一担半，叶金却收了四担，且多出了百分之五十的茎子来喂牲口。在交换工作经验时，这才发现叶金耕地是用的洋犁，而老张用的还是他的旧式耙子。当叶金下地时，高壮茂密的谷子遮掩了他的躯体；老张实在太生气了，他一怒将耙子烧毁，发誓永远不再使用这些过时的工具。
    保安屯的农民还得到了另一个宝贵经验，即使用了新的耕种方法可以节省人力多用牲力。例如，从春耕到夏植的时期里，每十亩地如果使用老式农具，就要二十四个半的人工和十头牲口。而使用了新农具，只需要十个人工和同样数目的牲口就行了。这样，新农具能节省一○·七五个劳动力。因为在所有的工作中都采用了新农具，去年春夏两季，保安屯农民省下三百七十二个劳动力。许多农民因此能从事其他工作。其结果，他们在两季中增加了人民币六百五十八万元的收益。
    这并不是说东北已经解决了一切新耕种方法的问题。远没有。它依然还需要许多的技术知识和经验。重要的事实在于农民已经认识，有了科学的协助，就能有很大的进展。这也是东北农业部经常通过各种活动给他们指示的。例如，在最近一次麦子收获时，经过部派技术人员的指导，有一个村子一天之内打了四千捆之多。这以前，农民所能到达的最高纪录是三百捆，而且还是费了最大力量的。这样具体的实证在农民思想上已经产生了很好的效果，他们都愿意把这种实验的结果应用在他们的计划和日常工作之中。
    这种进步的思想还有另一个重要的影响，我说的是它对人民生活所起的影响。
    永贵村村长金成林告诉我们说：“在土地改革前，我们只有十一户中农，却有七十二户贫雇农。现在我们村里百分之九十左右都是中农阶级。有些农民，虽还没有牲口，却已丰衣足食。他们的生活状况和别人一比不差多少。他们之所以被称为贫农，只是因为他们没有马而已。”
    从永贵村的图表中所列数字去看，证明金成林的话是确实的。而且我们看到，该村自从土地改革完成和使用了新农具以后，它的财富增加了百分之四十，而农民从副业生产的收入也增加了大约百分之四十五。
    如果你把保安屯和永贵村那样的进展再乘上数千个东北的农村，那你就可以很准确地认识到，解放对于我国的农民是具有何等的意义，新的方法和新的农具给他们带来了何等的繁荣。
  农业劳动力的良好组织
    东北农业劳动力的组织是按照高岗副主席在一九五○年三月的讲话，采用了科学与民主的原则的。当时，他在演讲中说：“忽视这种个体经济的积极性，或者挫折这种积极性是不能允许的，但在同时，我们必须用很大的注意力去发展和组织变工合作，才可以发展农村经济。”
    这话的意义是强调变工合作的组成要以自愿参加和互助为基础。它们是按照每一个个别区域的实际情况而组成和活动的。但同时也得照顾到各区农业计划的和副业生产的需要，农民群众的要求和从事组织的干部的能力。因为这种组织工作是相当复杂的，最大的注意是放在这些互助组的实际工作上，而不在它们的表面形式上。尚不止此，倡导这些小组是要使它们长期发展下去，并且要和农村经济中，像广泛利用新农具和消费合作社这样主要的工作联系起来。这些小组的中心目标是增加生产，在证明给农民看集体工作永远比单独工作要好一些。
    在我们访问过的每一个农村中都有这些合作组织。我们看到他们在农场工作中已运用了科学的分工方法和合理的劳力分配。干部们在计算各种农具使用的效力，牲畜和农民们自己的工作效力上是最精细不过的。一切都按工作单位以及完成每项工作所需时间来计算。
    分配工作用的是最民主的方式。小组制度是通用的，每组担任一项工作，每小组有一个领袖。在合作小组里，每人工作所得酬报每天用民主评议的方法按劳力单位计算。他们的原则是“工作越多，酬报越大”。这一整套的办法似已满足了每一组人，提高了农民的情绪，给他们以信心面对各种困难的工作。
    互助小组使劳力的使用更有效率，使土地得到深耕细植。我们可以从下面这张关于保安屯近年来生产情况的图表中看出一个这样的例子。
    一九四七年以来生产额比较表年份        生产总额          每垧平均产额        备考一九四七    二四○担  六·五一九四八    三八○担  八·○一九四九    四九○担  八·四     因天旱之故，增产量不大。一九五○    七○○担          一一·五
    我们还看到，目前在东北普遍流行的虽是这些小型的互助组，却已经有一些积极分子要求在将来更加跃进一步。这些领导分子已经组织了较大的合作社和生产大队。简单地举一个这一类的故事来说明某些东北农民所获得的进步是很值得的。
    一九四七年的春季里，保安屯土地改革初步完成了，从这次斗争中，出现了一个好干部名叫韩恩。他和他的几位同志在紧接着的生产竞赛中带头干。于是，向这样的一个人建议组织合作小组，就像在最肥沃的土地里播下经过特别选择的种子一样的产生特殊好的后果。共产党区委提出了这个建议。跟着，韩恩立即召集了保安屯的一个群众大会，向农民们解释，如何组织起来，他们就能致富。
    尽管有韩恩的热忱和辩才，这种思想最初还是不能好好推动。有一个农民说他有两条牛，不用互助，单干就能够对付活儿了。另一些农民对于地权还有顾虑呢，一旦地主翻了把，他们加入过互助组织的岂不要受累无穷。另一些听到互助就耸耸肩膀，说“老天饿不死瞎家雀”，换句话说，是“如果我需要，随时可以得到帮助”。
    韩恩不管他们反对，还挨户访问，渐渐就说服了一些农民来试试这个主意。后来他组成了三个小组，并且动起来了。自然啰，他们生产的结果使得个个人瞠目结舌。之后，几乎全体农民都加入了互助合作运动。
    在韩恩开始推动合作组织使它走向成功时，每一个小的合作单位的形式是固定的。小组之间不交换劳力，所有工作都在组内完成，不管它技术够不够，人员缺少或过多。这比之单干，当然效率更高，但是还没有达到最高效率。例如，并不是每项工作都需要组内所有的劳动力。有些工作也许只需要五个劳动力，但因为小组里有七个劳动力，就用这七个劳动力去做。这是显然的浪费。有时候，这样做还会产生恶劣的影响，因为同是一个村子里的农民，从事同等劳动，却因为小组人数多寡，所花时间长短，完成工作量不同，而所得的是不同的酬报。因此就引起了不满。
    韩恩钻研了整个问题，想出一个分配劳力的新方法。他建议分配要按照工作的实际需要。为达到此目的，必需打破小组的硬性的形式，使组与组之间能够换工。保安屯农民试行了这个新方式，成绩异常满意。根据他们的经验，他们决定继续采用这种“互助组换工制”。实际上这是小型的集体劳动，这样可以更科学化地计划与领导工作。它的结果呢？你可记得我已经说过，保安屯领到了东北农业部奖给的一联架合铲趟机，“穷棒子屯”富裕起来了。
    这样，东北农民懂得了科学的合作方法与良好的劳动组织的重要。他们看到，这样最新式的耕种方法如何达到了最高的效率，这样个别的农民作为互助组员之后，如何充分发挥了他的创造力，这样对于改善他们的生活具有何等重大的关系。
  劳动模范和党团员
    在分析东北农村区域的成就时，要对劳动模范和党团员的重要性有足够的估计不是一件容易的事情。他们在农村生活的每一个领域内都发生了极深刻的影响。前面提到过的一切因素—土地改革，新农具，合作互助，生产和生活水准的提高——这一切之所以可能都是因为有了这样的农民他们能够动员群众起来行动，他们能够做榜样，让其他的农民学习和效法。这样的人，在共产党和我们的人民政府的领导底下，已培养成为自我牺牲的干部，无论男女，他们都把革命事业看作高于一切，他们从他们现在的成绩上看过去，他们看到了未来的事业，他们要为工业化的中国建设一个农业基地，使中国人民能享受社会主义的欢乐。
    我从东北的干部身上看到一些卓越的特点。也许用这样的先进人物中间的一位，例如大家已知道了一些的韩恩同志，用他的话来表达是最好不过的。用他的话来说，“一个好干部，第一，不该让农民看到害怕。第二，得让农民信他的话。第三，他必须真正为农民工作。为了要把生产工作领导好，他必须亲自参加互助组，证明他比任何人都劳动得更好。”
    韩恩是可以让我们学习的人，他发表的关于干部的议论很值得我们再三思索。我说这话不仅因为他很成功地创设了互助组，被选为全国劳动模范会议的代表。我是根据他屯里的农民对他的看法而说这话的。
    有人说，“韩恩这种人不让你走过一座靠不住的桥梁。”另一个说，“人人都愿意在他的领导下来致富。”还有一个人对我们说，“韩恩懂得用民主方式开会。他事事都和群众商量，从来不先给群众发表长篇大论。他善于最后发言，总结所有农民们的意见，把正确的指出来，解释错误的为什么错了。最后他作出了行动的计划。由于韩恩的见解包含了屯里一切最好的意见，它常常就成了我们会议的决议”。
    人民所说的这些话真是干部工作的最宝贵的评议。这方面，我们可以肯定人民是赞赏韩恩的工作的。一般说来，他这种典型可以说代表了我们在东北所遇见的劳动模范、共产党员和青年团员。他们都是觉悟程度很高的人，能够很快接受新鲜事物和新的工作方法，能够缜密思考，把它们包含在计划中，对于工作同志能够谨慎地，有耐性地说明一切，无论在学习上，在工作上都能领导。难怪有一个农民说，“我们可以预见到我们的计划永远不会失败。”
    人民感激这样的领导。我还记得永贵村里一位老农的讲话。他名叫冯万山。首先他叙述了大半生的艰难困苦以及解放对于他和他家庭的好处。最后他的结语是：“我活了这末大，从没有见过这样的好日子。我坚决要出我每一分的力量搞好下一个收成，尽可能收更多的谷子。这就是我对于新中国经济建设出的一份力。这样我就报答了毛主席和中华人民共和国。”
    这一番话可以说是颂扬了东北的领导，颂扬了劳动模范、共产党、青年团以及为人民劳碌的政府干部人员。
  政府在灾难时的照顾
    东北人民全心全意投入生产工作中还有另一个原因，因为他们知道在遇到灾难时，政府是会来照顾他们的。过去，在这样的时候，政府确曾证明它和人民是一致的。
    我们这一行在东北发现了几个这样的实例。举其一例，长春郊外胡家店子的复兴史。
    这村子在伪满和国民党时代几乎被从地图上抹去了。毁了五百多幢房子。在解放之初，剩余的财产只是七条瘦牛，一些牲口和一辆破车。农民们没有衣服穿，饥饿到濒死了。
    刚一解放，人民政府赶紧送了三万斤救济粮给村中农民，并将六十五条牲口借给他们。后来村里又进行了土地改革。
    胡家店子后来怎样了呢？虽然在一九四九年秋收时期，粮食依然缺乏，但每一个农民都置了一套冬季的棉衣。到一九五○年，所有的房子都盖起来了，这时候他们的牲畜计有：骡驴一四一头，牛二十条，猪六百只。此外，村里有了六十一辆大车。粮食供应经常增加，到一九五一年，村中人人添了一套新衣服。
    还有另一个例子。由于我们的国家的发展还没有能够控制大自然，天灾有时还要打击我们的农民。松江省双城县第五区的民和村便是一个实例。
    当我们眺望它的时候，这农村的街道景色绚丽，黄澄澄的玉蜀黍和鲜红的辣椒挂在花屋檐下，一捆捆柴火叠在路边。这构成一幅愉快的场景。但不久以前，民和村的农民还不是这样欢乐。一九四七年，这里遭受了旱灾。去年，正恢复了一些元气，又遭受了雹灾，严重地损害了他们的庄稼。生产额只有平均数的百分之三十。因此，一九五○年夏锄时，村里已缺乏粮食和牲口的草料了。可是政府正密切留意着这种情况，它来照顾民和村的人民了。政府通过村里的消费合作社拨来了六六、五四○斤粮食来受农民支配。农民们自己组织了一个农村信用委员会，调查与分发这些粮食。由于这样的帮助，民和村度过了一个最困惑的难关，集中力量于生产，使地里的产量达到通常的数额。
    我们看到在东北，政府对于军属烈属也照顾得很周到。他们有他们自己的房子，足够的粮食，新衣服和牲畜。因为村里的经济水平提高，这些军烈属的地位也提高了。例如，永贵村有二十五家军属。其中二十一家在土地改革前是雇农。土地改革后，一家已到达富农阶级，其余二十家已成为中农。其余四家或维持原来的中农地位，或已提高到富农。却不论怎样的家庭，如果由于参军而致劳动力不够，或发生了其他困难，政府和共产党随时给予照顾，解决困难。
    这样，东北的农民感觉到他们无论在平时，或在困难的时候，都能得到各方面的支持。对于提高生产水平是有直接的，蓬蓬勃勃的影响的。
  公粮与开支以外的剩余
    在东北农村中，最愉快的事实是看不到饥饿、寒冻或忧愁的面容。恰恰相反，通常所见的总是容光焕发的农民和他们的全家，穿的是新衣——新的衣面，新的衬棉和新的夹里。同时常常会听到农民告诉你，有生以来这是第一次，他们手上有了剩余的谷子和其他的日用必需品，而且银行里还有存款。这说明生活标准的提高已活生生地呈现在我们眼前，农民们缴了公粮，购置了生活必需品，喂饲了牲畜之外，还有他们自己的一份财富。这证明农民们在为新中国工作时，同时也就为他们自己工作了。
    一九五○年秋季丰收后，由于合作社和国营贸易机构的公平买卖政策，留在农民手里的谷子估计达四百万吨。这是一九四九年余粮的一倍。此外，据报告，一九五○年东北储蓄存款的数目和一九四九年相比增加了七·五倍，其中包含农民的储蓄。这一切说明农民和他们的家庭购买力是在迅速增加。根据东北合作总社初步估计，一九五一年的景况要比一九五○年再增加百分之六十。
    农民怎样利用他们的盈余来购买布匹，说起来是饶有趣味的。一九四九年他们购买了四百万匹。到一九五○年，布匹营业总额跳跃了百分之一百二十五，即九百零二万匹。不仅如此，农民的购买习惯也改变了。
    现在在东北，他们所要求的不仅是布匹了。以前，蓝布黑布无所谓，是布就行。可是现在，农民自觉是富裕了。他们也要讲究穿，所以他们讲究起印花图案和颜色来了。
    有一个农民说，“颜色是生命，我们刚懂得生命是什么。”
    这是很明显的，购买力的增加大大刺激了农业生产。这也是很明显的，这种情况大大刺激了工业生产。农民的要求已超越了他们的个人需要。例如，东北政府的经济机构曾订购几万套农具，以供应农民的需要。对一切物品的需要都在提高，这就得把注意力集中到消费合作社上面去。因此应该明了消费合作社在农业经济中的任务。
  消费合作社的任务
    民和村合作社经理刘英兰说：“合作社必须依靠群众的需要和意向，因为它们都是和生产联系的。”
    这是从经验里得出来的教训。可是刘英兰和其他的合作社经理煞费苦心才懂得了这个道理，因为在解放前，他们一点没有接触过这种机构。许多合作社在开始时，只是为了很快的将货物脱手，只是短时期存在，目的也只是谋利而已。它们卖的货物是迷信物品，化妆品和其他奢侈品。有些合作社甚至没有股本。农民们只是把他们从地主那里分来的果实凑起来而已。他们觉得这种钱财本来是意外得来的，因此可以作为一种“赌博”似的投资给合作社。这就表示他们对合作社并无正确认识，因此也就跟它不发生什么关系。合作社被他们看作不过是一种转眼即逝的玩意儿。有些农民认为做了合作社社员，买东西就不必付现款，这好比是一种家庭债务，不妨赊欠一个时候的。
    只在共产党和区合作局进行了教育与帮助之后，这些误解才告消除。区合作局的领导分子不得不从合作社课程的第一课开始，教授了合作社理事会的责任是什么，如何召开会议，在会议中讨论与表决什么，以及如何查账等等。
    在这样的协助之后，各地合作社才开始购存农民的基本必需品。这激起了农民的兴趣，他们开始大量参加。同时，经理们开始了解，合作社不仅是店铺，而且是解决生产和生活问题的中心。这样一来，农民们真是自动参加了，因此农村中不加入合作社的人现在几乎是绝无仅有的。
    这究竟是怎样完成的，我们可以举民和村合作社做例子。
    这个合作社是完全改建过的。在他们懂得了正确的工作原则后，他们就推销股子，并允许贫农分期付款。负责的工作人员经过选举选出来，定期的会议和审查与稽核制度都建立了。工作人员在社内服务时，可贷给劳动力，代替他们耕作，并按照每月的预算供给他们衣服和伙食。这一切正在将现代化的经营方法教给农民。同时，这又提供了民主管理的另外一课，因为实际上是整个村子都参加了合作社的决议的。
    在这些改革之后，民和村合作社就蒸蒸日上地发展起来。它终于能够承担购销农民的产品的责任。这就给农民省却了许多麻烦，而且办理结果异常圆满，巩固了农民对合作社的信心。此外，合作社还赚了钱，一九五○年六月决算时，股东们分到了百分之二十五的红利。
    由于刘英兰的管理得法，民和村合作社开始完全和全村的生活与经济结合起来。例如，一九五○年春天，春耕的种子不够了。刘英兰立即召开理事会。他们计算了一下所需的种子。他们就卖了一部分存货，买进种子，再在短期贷款的基础上。附于优惠的条件分发给大家。这就使播种及时完成了。
    合作社还用其他的方法来帮助民和村的农民，譬如预先调查他们的需要，事先购存合用的农具，或者在收割前贷给粮食以保障收成，因为农民常因缺粮原故而被迫去吃掉未熟的庄稼。
    由于人民的绝对支持，民和村合作社又向前迈进了一步。除去原来的各项业务外，它更作为一个金融机构开始参加到农村经济中去。它设立了一个存款及放款部门。一方面供应农民的需要，另一方面通过这个新设部门帮助农民贷出他们的余款及余粮，得些利息。这将收鼓励生产之功，而生产又会刺激贸易，这样就利用本村的力量去解决村里的经济困难。
    这是一种新方式，是一种群众性的信用组织。它在比较大的金融机构——如东北人民银行——的主持与保护下，使本来呆滞的资金活动起来。又是由于共产党员的带头领导，把他们的谷物和款项存到合作社中，由于这个存放款部门解决了各种各样本来会妨碍生产的问题——包括有些个人问题在内——迄今这个组织已获得了初步的成就。
    因此，消费合作社在增设了银行业务后，更进一步紧密了它们与人民的联系。它们对农村经济的重建及对新中国的贡献也就增加了。
    在东北农民的生活中，合作社已经成为一个巨大的力量。一九五○年内，合作社社员增加了百分之一二七。它们的零售贸易增加了百分之四九四，超过原计划百分之二五·八。它们的购货额较一九四九年增加了百分之三九四，超过原订计划百分之七·四。从这些数字中我们可以看出，消费合作社不但帮助农民，而且是城乡交流中的一个重大因素，对我们国家的重建是个基本因素。
  农村与政治进展
    土地改革既改变了基本的经济情况，便铺平了东北农村的农民们改变整个政治环境及政治机构的道路。群众的自由，代替了旧日所受的压迫。群众的权力，代替了集中在地主及他们的狗腿子手中的霸权。这些变革比起生产上的进展，不仅并不逊色，而且是与它们有着不可分的联带关系的。
    在这方面最突出的一桩事例，也许就是参加农村政治生活的广泛性。除开过去的地主外，各阶层都积极地参加了政府的管理。大多数的农村都划分成若干段，每段有若干户。这些段在选举村人民代表会议时提出候选人。在选举之后，代表会议再推举一个人数较少的委员会。
    村委员会是政府推动工作的基层。委员会中有明确的分工，每个委员负责一个部门。虽然每村情况不同，通常村委员会有下列部门：村长办事处，副村长办事处，民政处，人民法院或调解处，生产办事处，以及民兵，公安，文教，卫生，财粮等部门。通常村委员会并设秘书一人。
    村人民代表会议一般每年举行三次，必要时则举行得更经常些。为了解决某个问题，也常有召集特别会议去动员农民的情形。譬如在一九五○年九月，许多的村人民代表会议便曾扩大举行全体大会，计划有效地收割小麦。从这些群众大会中产生了一个小麦收割委员会，担任收割、工作检查、登账，贮藏、运送及其他工作。
    每季及每年工作的具体计划，也召集人民代表会议来制定。这些会议并审查已定计划的进行情况，将结果直接报告给村民。另外还召集一些会议来交换生产及行政经验，来作对生产工作的给奖、批评和处罚。
    在村政府中，大大地发展了最珍贵的批评与自我批评的武器。许多缺点及脱离政府政策的偏向，都是由此而发现的。譬如在有些村中，某些农民因为阶级成份划错，而被剥夺了政治权利。在另外一些情况下，保护中农的政策曾被滥用，使地主逃过了人民的裁判。这两种错误，以及许多其他的错误，都遭到了严厉的攻击并通过批评及自我批评而得到了纠正。
    村政府代表会议选出区代表，区代表再选举县政府。这样推选上去一直到省政府。每级政府的主要特点，都是遇事与群众商量。这种办法曾产生了最为圆满的结果，不但在国内问题及地方问题上如此，在有关国际问题时也是如此。譬如农民对于争取和平的世界斗争，就有着清楚的认识，而且他们要求宣告他们也参与这一斗争。单拿两个村子的结果来做例子吧，永贵村百分之八十的农民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名。在民和村的一四七○人中，有一一○一人签名拥护和平。
    每个农村都有自己的武装，由农民自己组织，由他们通过村委员会来管理。男女都参加民兵。民兵的任务是保护收成与农田、防火、防地主的阴谋、防帝国主义特务与国民党残余的破坏。
    东北农民政治开展的另一个表现，是他们志愿参加人民解放军的纪录。成千成万的农民已经入伍。全东北大概找不出一个在解放军里没有人的村落。
    既然生产与政治不能分开，共产党员与青年团员自然也不能与生产及政治分离。在这两个方面的任何场合中，都是这些进步分子出最大的力，作最大的牺牲，发表最严格的自我批评。他们在农村人口中所占的比例甚小，但是他们的影响却是巨大的。
    我已经说明过东北农民群众如何追随他们的领导，如何感激这种领导。现在我愿意叙述一个故事，来说明东北农民对这种领导的珍视。
    在解放之前，惯常是用最大及最有势力的地主的名字来称呼各个村子。现在这种习惯改变了。今天的农村是以人民英雄的名字来命名的。
    在这一篇报告中我曾一直提起永贵村这个名字。过去是有一个叫做满永贵的。他从十二岁起，就当长工。但是在他的早年，他就知道总有一天日子会比他所过的好。永贵是一个好寻根究底的人，他终于在共产党的领导之下找到了出路。在他的村子解放之前，他把农民组织起来。在解放之后，他当选为翻身农民协会的主席。他以主席的身份领导反对地主的斗争，并开垦熟荒，使得穷人都有饭吃。
    永贵为了他的村子不懈地努力，鼓励农民提高生产，并且把这件事与从他们生活的各方面铲除封建势力的斗争结合起来。他变成了村里的领袖之一，后来又成为全区的领导人物。在那时候他就参加了共产党。
    这个大公无私的人，在他当区长及当本地农民协会主席的时候，生活都极俭朴，工作非常努力。在收获的时候，他生病了。但是永贵却不肯告假。他工作着，工作着，战胜了疲劳及磨蚀着他的病痛。他的病况愈来愈坏，最后他的精神再也无法撑持。他终于在把他的一切贡献给人民之后而死去了。（⑵⑶）
    后来在一个群众大会上，农民刘金山和杨昆及另外几个人提出一项建议。纪录本上载着他们的话：“咱们这个村叫黄有村。过去地主有权力来欺压咱们。共产党来后，咱们过去的区长满永贵领导咱们消灭封建，他为咱们打下了发家致富的基础。是他领导咱们走上翻身的道路。他是与咱们一个阶级的人，咱们一定要设法纪念纪念他。因此咱提议把黄有村改叫永贵村，来纪念咱们亲爱的满永贵同志。”这个建议获得全体村民的一致赞同，因为他们都尊重满永贵本人，也尊重满永贵所代表的党。

    东北农民在政治上进步的另一表现，是农村中妇女地位的提高。在生活的各个方面，她们现在都积极参加。她们在生产中所尽的劳力，使她们获得与男人同样的荣誉与报酬。她们在村委员会里的代表数目，就我们在永贵村所见，高达全体委员数的百分之四十五。她们在经济、文化及卫生各方面都担任负责地位。我们看到一般东北妇女都已变为一种新型的中国人，洗净了身上的一切封建残余，帮助她们的男人及老人作同样的努力。
  福利与文化的进展
    由此我们看到土地改革已经在经济上及政治上改变了东北农村的生活。当然，这种改变也反映在农村的福利及文化活动上的。
    卫生方面已经有了很大的进步。许多农村每年都有三次预防伤寒、霍乱及鼠疫的注射运动，及一次预防天花的种痘运动。这一切注射不但都是免费的，而且在大多数的村中，单是这些卫生工作已经比过去人民所有的医疗照顾多了百分之一百。因为在日本帝国主义及国民党时代，村民们与现代医药是完全无缘的。
    所有这些医疗工作都是由每区的诊疗站进行的。这些诊疗站免费诊疗，在特殊情况下则仅作形式上的收费。此外，许多地方有农民设立的医药合作社。这些合作社以低价供应医药，辅助推进农村一般医疗工作。松江省已经有一百个这样的合作社在营业。
    农村中的接生婆问题也已经得到了很好的处理。她们在开业之前必须在区诊疗站受过现代接生方法的训练。这样，旧式的接生婆就重新得到训练，新的接生婆则一开始就有正确方式的训练了。
    大多数农村中的办法，是容许产妇在产后休养一个月的。在这段时间中，特别供给她们大米、白面、鸡蛋和糖。
    对接生婆的训练及重新训练，对产妇的特别照顾，其结果使婴儿死亡率减低到令人极为兴奋的程度。譬如在永贵村，一九五○年计共出生婴儿四十四人，其中只有三个死亡。而回顾过去来比较一下，这样的死亡率是微乎其微的。现在永贵村及整个区的卫生主管方面正努力把婴儿死亡率减少到最低限度。为此他们拟对婴儿给予更多的照顾，并继续坚持所有接生婆必须遵守规定，没有割脐带用的剪刀以及酒精药棉等基本设备时，不得接生。
    关于其他的医务工作者，东北卫生当局准许中医继续应诊，但却经常鼓励他们去取得更多的医药知识及训练。同时，在有更多的合格医务人员可以调度的时候，就把他们派去为农民服务。
    我们看到农民们一般地都接受了有关卫生的指导，并且都把它应用到他们日常生活和烹调居住上去。因此整个卫生方面的标准，也显著地提高了。东北人民已经一个个变成满面发出健康的红光，全身充沛着精力的健壮男女。
    在文教活动上，也有了同样的进展。过去，几乎全体村民都是文盲。写信是一件闻所未闻的事，即或有之，便算是重大事件。写封信或者念封信都是大事一桩。而现在，东北几乎每个农村都有自己的一所小学，为农民的孩子以及农民本人服务。去年，这样的小学新建了二六七三所。
    胡家店子的农民，当他们在废墟上重建村庄的时候，同时也盖了一所他们前所未有的学堂。百分之七十的学龄儿童都入了学，而这个数字还在逐年增加。事实上在东北全境，几乎所有的学龄儿童现在都能得到应有的教育了。
    正如所有其他的农村一样，胡家店子的成人也大大地利用着村里的学校。在冬学期间，七百个成人注册入学，其中有三百人是妇女。有几个过去连自己的名字都不会写的成年人，现在识字竟达一千个之多了。大多数农民也能简单地计算及书写。儿童的进步更为显著，有些已经进了高小或中学了。
    永贵村的情形也是同样的。村里百分之百的儿童都已入学。同样重要的是，入学年龄已在农民群众的要求下提高到十七岁，这样可以使更多的人受到学校的好处。至于那些十七岁以上的人则上冬学。
    从这些例子中我们可以看出，东北的农民在思想上已经获得解放，他们渴求知识与文化。这已经是一个启蒙及进步的时代。随着这个时代的前进，生活及思想方面古旧与阻碍进步的习惯就会受到尖锐的打击。最重要的一个例子，就是旧的迷信已经失去它对人民的控制了。在永贵村，我们看到祭拜各种神佛的习俗已经完全废除了。尤其是再也没有人花钱去买香烛及其他迷信品了，新年的时候也没有人浪费时间去拜偶像了。东北农民已经把这一切送到它们应该去地方——送到了历史书和博物馆中去了。他们认识到只有一种力量，那就是人民的力量。这就是我们的东北农民们的进步。
  城市与建设
    在乡下农业生产不断增加的基础上，东北的城市正迅速地发展为新中国的基地。因为比较现代化的工业都集中在这些位于我国最大的富源所在地的城市里。从这个有着钢铁厂、发电厂、工作母机制造厂的重工业基地，可以看到东北的真正重要性。当你看到中国的新主人翁——站起来了的产业工人阶级——在工作着，克服着困难，使用着东北工厂的能量的时候，你就会懂得，任何东西也阻止不了中国人民实现他们工业化的美丽的理想。
    东北工厂在最近的这段历史是改革和改造的历史。它必须把日伪统治下的殖民地性质转变为首先支援解放战争，其次改进人民的生计，使城市协助农村经济的重建。
    它必须从日寇和国民党所制造的破坏中重建起来，这种破坏是他们眼看奸计行将失败时干出来的。根据东北人民政府高崇民副主席的话，仅在国民党统治的那段时期，就破坏了百分之五十到七十的机器和设备，并向技术人员施以攻击和残杀，威胁他们相率离散。甚至没有一座较大的铁路桥梁是完整的。
    由于土地改革后生产率的增加，而且在城市中依靠了工人阶级，东北的工业产量已逐渐恢复起来，走上了重建和发展的道路。东北工业不仅完成了对于人民解放军和农民的任务，并且为经济建设累积了资金，为大规模生产积聚了经验。从一九四九年起它不断地飞跃发展。仅在一九五○年一年中，东北人民政府投资在工业建设的总额就占预算的百分之四十，超过了计划的百分之三·六。这项投资使工业设备由百分之十扩大到百分之六十，而且在某些个别工厂里竟扩大到百分之八百。在一九五○年内新建或修理的厂屋和堆栈所占的面积共达八十七万平方公尺。同时工人住宅，医院，疗养院，托儿所，俱乐部和其他机构也增加了一百五十六万平方公尺的面积。
    一九五○年公营工厂的生产总值是一九四九年的百分之一一七·三，东北工人的人数增加了百分之三五·二。同时，城市人民的购买力也较一九四九年增加了百分之二○·五，这就进一步地刺激了贸易和工业的发展。
  人民的工厂
    在这篇报道中，我只打算就东北的几个国营工厂来谈，说一说在调查过程中我个人所得的印象。
    哈尔滨铁路修理厂有四十七年的历史，现在除总厂以外还有十九个分厂。全厂工人经常的工作是修理和检查车辆。他们不仅完成了预定的任务，常常超额完成计划，并且从废铁堆中修改了许多火车头，有几辆还以坚固耐用出名。其中有一辆是用朱德副主席的名字来命名的。
    此外，哈尔滨工厂还响应了国家的需要做了些额外工作。事实上这些额外工作竟超过了经常工作的三分之一。例如，当佳木斯河、松花江和拉林河更换新桥的时候，该厂担任制造桥梁钢架的任务。这项工作须要装置一座炼钢用的三吨电炉。工人、技师和工程师经过五天五夜的紧张工作，提早了几天完成任务。后来哈尔滨工厂又完成了一座八十吨的双臂架桥机，这种机器对于国内将来修建桥梁是大有帮助的。

    说小丰满发电厂是中国人民的血汗造成的是一点也不假的。日本人在一九四三年开始建造，强迫了几千个工人去工作，并残酷地压迫他们。结果到一九四五年这项工作仅完成了百分之二十九。但为这一点工作所付的生命代价却很重大，有人估计因此而死亡的中国工人多达一万人。
    正当解放之前，国民党派了一队兵去破坏这座发电厂。但由于工人的机智，这批土匪尽能破坏了一些不重要的部分，保存了主要的设备。
    解放以后，工人们提出了“不让电力停止供应”的口号。为了履行这句口号，工人和干部一直不停地工作，修理机器，重修堤岸，并且保持了“没有重大事故”的纪录。现在小丰满是为着人民，为着新中国在生产电力。

    在东北，历史最悠久而且最著名的工业也许要算鞍山钢铁公司了。据我们的了解，远在一千三百年前，朝鲜人已在鞍山炼铁了。那时的高句丽王国占领着今日的辽东半岛。
    一九三三年，日本侵略者夺取了鞍山已经成长起来的工厂，扩大它的设备和生产，以服从帝国主义的目的。但是他们不用机器而用人力，因为剥削中国工人是更为便宜的。所以他们雇用的劳力多到了十七万人。
    当国民党在一九四六年接收该厂的时候，它已经遭受了严重的破坏。可是他们居然恢复了一只炼炉来产钢，雇用了约一万个工人。但在一九四八年二月解放的时候，大多数工人已被遣散。
    人民政府着手来恢复这座受了创伤的庞然巨物。干部召集工人回来，利用以前随人民解放军撤退的积极分子或有组织的留在厂后准备保护工厂的工人做基本力量。从这批人中间产生了高度的工作热忱，结果实现了许多惊人的成就，其中包括把钢的产量提高到原定计划的百分之一百三十六。
    现在厂里许多最复杂的工作都由中国技师和工程师担任，过去这些工作是被日本人看作禁脔的。
    当我们在参观这座庞大的钢铁工厂的时候，那种有组织的社会生产给我无限的激动，使我口噤不能说话。我不由得憧憬着中国人民的前途，正如钢铁一样的锻炼。
    我看到埋头苦干的炼钢工人在锤击那巨大的开口熔炉。从特制的眼镜中我看见炼钢的情况。起重机隆隆地在头顶上移动，尖锐的汽笛声掩盖了所有其他的声音，机车像雷鸣似地滚过。当炼钢炉的炉门一打开，发出一道灿烂光芒，使我回想起希腊神话中独眼魔王赛克罗皮斯的故事（Cyclopes是希腊神话中掌雷电的巨人）。钢从巨大的桶里倾出，喷射出硕大无比的火花，照耀了满天。我心里不由得想到：“这是中国的生命力”。
    鞍山的参观还给我另一些感想。许多次我听人说中国必需外来的技术人员，自己是做不了什么的。当然，在我们的工业尚未发达的情况之下，我们确需技术的帮助。但一经想到这个问题，解决的方法亦就随之而来。这句话说得很安详而且有着坚定的信心的。鞍山熔铁厂长温良贤同志以前是老解放区的熔铁工人，他说：“只要我们充分地依靠工人并虚心学习，我相信我们是能够管理好现代化的工厂的。”
    当我离开鞍山钢铁公司的时候，我心里毫不怀疑总有这么一天中国工人能够全部自己管理这座工厂，同样他们将能全部自己管理新中国所将建立的许多同样的工厂。
    我对于我们所看过的吉林造纸厂，大连船坞以及其他一些工业还可以继续叙述他们的历史和情况，但以上的例子已足够表现东北的工业正在茁壮之中，工人们已经以主人翁的姿态来管理工业了。
  苏联帮助的重要性
    我叙述了东北工业的进步，直到现在还没有提到苏联技师和工人在这进展中所起的作用。我这样做法是有用意的。首先，我们的苏联朋友曾慷慨地把他们的经验供给我们，这里所表现的国际主义就值得用一整章来大书特书。其次，他们在我们各种生产建设中所起作用是如此之大，所以必须加以详细叙述。苏联的技师和工人给中国带来了解决各种实际问题的经验宝库。他们带来了应用最高科学的知识，他们带来的是为人民服务的丰富的工作经验。其中有许多人参加过十月社会主义革命之后初期的建设工作。他们都在苏联社会主义的建设和共产主义的准备工作中英勇地工作过的。因此，我们在中国所遭遇的情况和困难也正是他们以前所遭遇和克服过的。他们的任务和他们最大的快乐就是帮助中国人民利用这种经验来建设新中国。
    在东北各地凡有苏联技师和工人工作的地方，我们总看到他们和中国工人紧密团结地推进着工作。我们的人民管他们叫“老大哥”。我记得参观哈尔滨修理厂的时候，厂长张鸿树同志热烈地表示他愿意当一个小学生去向苏联同志学习。副厂长赫里杰维赤笑容满面地盛赞他这位伙伴的进步。这种相互的尊敬是中苏合作的普遍的现象。
    向苏联工人学习的愿望大部分无疑是出之于他们对于工作的态度。在哈尔滨工厂里我们见着一位被选为劳动模范的苏联工人。他名叫包罗金，是个年已七十五岁的老人，是汽锤部的主任。他对我们所说的话正可表现这种态度。他说：“每一个人都有他的朋友。我的朋友就是这个汽锤。工人的最要紧的事是爱护他的工具。因为如果工具一出毛病，我们也只好停止工作。这是对国家的一种损失。所以这么些年来，我总是热爱着我的汽锤如同最好的朋友一样。”
    除了爱劳动和爱为人民致富的工具之外，还得配合着在管理和工作方面的重视精确性和科学。中国工人们说：“我们的苏联同志对于极细微的事都是认真不苟的。没有事先精确计算好的事决不动手去做。”
    在鞍山工厂里有一个例子。一九四九年九月定出了一个计划准备在一九五○年八月把一只大熔炉完全修复。可是苏联技师仔细审查这个计划和熔炉的情况之后，建议立即动手修理，并且预计本年内就可修好使用。一般老工程师对这表示怀疑，但是苏联技师胸有成竹，他们有着在气候远为恶劣的西伯利亚做修理工作的经验。工人们得到这种信心的支持，就动起手来，竟在一九四九年底的前几天完成了工作。
    苏联工人的无处不利用科学可从小丰满发电厂中所发生的一件事情上看出来。
    重建这座电厂的一件重要工作是修筑堤岸，蓄水成湖，由此发生电力。这项工作原定要到一九五一年才能完成。但是派来该厂的苏联技师建议在一九五○年七月十五日完成它。理由是照气象上的观察，一九五○年秋季的雨量将有增加。如果不把堤岸加强准备，很可能遭遇严重损毁，以致前功尽弃。
    这项建议被接受了。去年秋天松花江的水比往年涨得更高，但是堤岸已经修好，电厂的工作仍然照常进行。
    这些国际友人给我们帮忙的例子不胜枚举。他们对于工人生活，住宅，医疗卫生和学习的热诚关注也是无法计算的。
    当我写到这里的时候，使我回想起苏联友人的真挚，想到那些自我牺牲的人们如大连海港港长诺维果夫，他在上次大战中是列宁格勒港港长，他的独子在解放柏林时牺牲了。我们到过几位这样的同志的简单清洁的住处去访问他们，并听了他们的生平事迹。在我认识了他们之后，就明白为什么他们会常常打破生产的纪录。当我看到炼钢的效率提高了百分之三十五，炼焦煤的时间从二十一小时减到十六小时半，全东北的煤矿在采用苏联方法之后生产量从百分之二十增加到百分之三十，我才真正了解到苏联技师偕同着中国同志们从事工作的努力。
  新中国的工人
    应用在工业方面的苏联科学也应用到东北的企业管理制度方面，因而建立了“按件计工”的合理工资制。由于工会和共产党的领导，这项新制度在工人中间激起了一种极重要的革新运动，因而产生了新型的中国工人，他们是工人阶级中的先锋，他们只从国家的进步着想。他们在城市的地位，等于乡村中的劳动模范。他们合力促使新中国向前迈进。
    还是举一个工厂做例子罢，让我来引用一下哈尔滨工厂的数字。在这厂的光荣簿上有一个庞玺顺的名字。这位工人发明了一个铁模，不但把每日生产量从三百五十个单位增加到一千五百个单位，而且把质量从百分之五十的纯度提高到百分之九十。
    在这光荣簿上再往下看去，你就看到段尚俭的名字。他发明了两种新法，一种是关于压延作业法，增加效率六倍之多；另一种是砸铁机，节省了十五个工人的劳力并给车间增加了百分之二百八十的生产量。
    一九五○年内整个哈尔滨工厂采用了工人的三百二十件合理化建议。由于这些革新，仅仅从一九五○年一月至九月就节省了人民币三亿六千八百四十万元。利用废料，又节省了五十二亿六千万元。此外，利用废铁还建造了一千平方公尺的办公室，一所小医院，一所托儿所，和二千平方公尺的新厂屋。一九五○年的上半年全厂生产量增加了百分之三十；同时因采用了苏联的管理制度和更科学的分工，管理部门的职员也大大地减少。
    这一切说明了为什么哈尔滨工厂有三百八十七位劳动模范，六十四位受表扬的劳动英雄，六百五十八位超等工人，和三百九十八位先进工人，这都是工人们自己选举出来的。这一切说明了为什么有二十八位头等干部从车间主任或分厂厂长中挑选出来转移到别的更重要的任务去，并说明了现在的车间主任和分厂厂长是从工人阶层中提升起来的。
    这就是追随学习苏联榜样的被解放的劳动力。这种气氛产生了如赵国有那样的工人和他的创造新纪录的运动，这种运动散布到工业的每个部门，创造了二一、七四○件新纪录，并有数以万计的工人个别地和集体地参加到运动中来。
  对于私营工业的影响
    土地改革，东北国营工业伟大的复兴，和工人们的热情，使整个东北经济活跃起来。这也包括私营工业。在日本侵略者及国民党强盗时期，私营工业或者自行凋敝，或者在市场上被有意地排挤出去。人民政府却把形势整个扭转过来。私营工业受到鼓励向农村发展以谋复兴，从而帮助了乡村的经济建设。政府用下列几种方法来帮助工业家：
    甲：解决货物的市场问题。政府机关向他们订购成品，或者将半制成品交由私营工厂去加工。
    乙：解决劳资问题。政府鼓励劳资双方签定照顾到双方利益的合同，并且也鼓励劳资双方成立关于生产的协商委员会。截至现在，经验证明这个政策增加了生产，并且在东北私营工业的工人中间推动了减少浪费运动。
    丙：政府对于取得原料，电力和资本，给予了有计划的协助。
    丁：政府加强了东北工商联的工作。
    实行这些政策的结果，使私营工业向前发展，特别是与国家经济直接有关的工厂，如机器制造业，或钢铁厂等。例如沈阳在一九五○年一月仅仅有五九六家铁工厂，但是到了年中，便增加到一○一四家，工人的数目加了一倍。在同一时期，沈阳私营工业的投资也从人民币九百四十六亿元增加到一千七百一十四亿元。同年的生产总值，第三季比第一季增加了百分之二三·一。据高岗副主席最近的报告，从全面看来，沈阳的私营工业从一九四九年十二月到一九五○年十一月之间，增加了百分之三○·二，工人数目增加了百分之三二·四。这既然是东北主要工业城市的情形，可见私营工业在整个东北境内是随着国营工业的建设，在政府沟通城乡经济的政策下，复兴起来。
  城市与政治进步
    东北城市解放以后，政治上都需要完全改造。以前的基层政府是万恶的“保甲制”压在人民脖颈上，如一桎梏。自从区人民政府的制度建立以后，这个担负便永远解除了，因为政治的责任已经回到人民手里。他们通过街弄联合会或其他团体，直接参加选举他们的代表。东北城市有史以来第一次得到了有利于群众发展的指示。
    区政府选出代表去参加县级人民代表会议。县政府就是从这些会议中产生的。他们传达群众的意见，讨论及通过各种法令，并且选举工作人员。
    研究这些会议的发展，可注意的是会议开的次数越多，其代表人民的程度也越加强。代表的名额既增加，各界代表的比重也随之逐渐调整，因而能准确地反映一个城市人口的成员。例如长春，在第一届全市会议上，仅有七十名代表出席，到第五届时，人数已经增到三百一十名了。
    共产党员和新民主主义青年团员在城市中所担任的工作与农村一般重要。在生产中，他们经常不畏牺牲地站在最前线。例如女共产党员赵桂兰，便为了保护大连一座工厂的爆炸，失掉了她的手臂。
    党团员的行动是由毛主席，共产党与中央人民政府的指示所领导着。这些指示就是：接收生产工具时要好好保存，克服一切困难来恢复，使每一块钱都用在生产上，训练干部，最后，为实现中国经济复兴及工业建设而奋斗。
    共产党员和新民主主义青年团员在启发人民政治觉悟上也起着领导作用。其结果是：东北的群众在全国领先表示了对美帝国主义轰炸我们城市的愤怒。他们手里握有新生活的胜利果实，未来的发展完全在他们掌握之中。因此，他们首先正告美国，我们决心抵抗并击败帝国主义者对朝鲜，中国，与世界和平的攻击。
    东北城市群众这样站稳立场，在全国起着带头作用，是归功于他们在政治上的迅速发展。
  城市的福利与文化
    东北发展给我印象最深的一件事就是在城市工人阶级的福利，文化和教育上的长足进步。
    关系工人生命最密切的是在工厂、矿场和纺织厂中的安全及卫生设备。最近这些已经扩大并且改善了。沈阳工厂的例子可以说明这些进展。
    沈阳虽然拥有二○四家国营与私营的工厂，但是安全卫生工作过去一直没有很好地展开。人民政府在这方面采取行动时，首先拿两个工厂作典型试验，然后把试验的结果逐渐推广到其他工厂中去。在一九五○年，工厂安全卫生委员会成立了。由于市政府的协助，以及劳动局、卫生局、工会、警察及医药专家的合作，把工作深入到沈阳整个公私营的工厂机构中。在工作进展中，引起了全市劳动大众的兴趣，争取工作中的安全与卫生变成为一个经常的运动了。
    安全卫生委员会的主要任务是在研究和改进机器，并深入所有关于安全卫生设备的问题。它同时也做统计工作，推进厂里的安全教育，并采取一些措施以妨止意外损害事件的发生。
    基于此，委员会为了明了全面状况，到各工厂去彻底检查。同时开始举行工人体格检验，并采用卫生卡片制。并在没有诊疗所的工厂中设立了诊疗所。当这些工作在进行的时候，最重要的问题也处理了。那就是：大部分工厂的空气不够流通，光线不足，热度太高，潮湿太重，还有尘埃及其他有碍工人健康的危险。凡此种种建议提出后，就在许多工厂中试办，确定了能解决问题后，便将逐渐发展到别的工厂中。此外，工厂的厨房，饭厅，宿舍，浴室和厕所也进行了卫生工作。凡没有具备这些福利设备的，都正采取步骤使其尽快地装置起来。
    由于采行了一种新的负责制，安全措施也加强了。根据这种制度，各组工人分别担负机器一部分的责任。这种责任视各个厂址的情形而定，有时甚至扩展到整个工厂，纺织厂，矿场中。工人们的责任即在消灭可以造成意外事件的缺陷。厂方管理人员的责任则在保证调换或修理机器的缺陷或采取其他避免危险的行动。劳资两方签订了合同，详细规定出双方应负的责任。此外，还成立安全委员会，经常举行安全教育运动。所有新的安全设备都先经工人们讨论后再采用。这个制度在采用的工厂中都获到了伟大的成功。
    大工业城中的安全卫生工作是复杂的，进行时必须小心。因此，沈阳的工厂安全卫生委员会是根据一个明确的计划进行的，首先集中大型工厂以吸取经验，然后再把工作推向小型工厂。工作的前程非常远大，这全部计划说明了人民政府认识到这项工作的必要性。
    在其他东北城市中，工人的卫生设备已发展到厂地之外了。我们一行访问了大连远东电力公司工人的一座疗养院，这个电力公司是苏联最近完成移交给我们的工业设备之一。疗养院是一座现代建筑，耸立山麓，前临大海，周围都是青松，红枫，和樱花，景致异常幽美。以前是日本军阀的一座别墅，如今属于中国的劳动人民了。
    疗养院的经费是由该厂劳动保险基金中支付的。在那里养息的工人除了照支薪金外，每天还有一笔经常的津贴。劳动模范们，在生产上有过良好纪录的工人们以及工厂干部们，来这舒适怡人的环境中养息，享受着精美的饭食和娱乐设备。每两周便有百名新的工人利用这个机会来增进他们的健康。经过两周的居住，他们的体重都增加了。
    就整个东北来说，这样的工人卫生已经发展到全境有几百所医院，诊疗所和疗养院。这是时代的表现。在这时代里，工人是自己祖国的主人，新社会处处使他们可以走上美好的生活。
    为了完成东北所担负的生产任务，并普遍地增进人民健康，对于公共卫生计划也同样予以关切注意。尽管卫生人员及设备都不充足，东北工人已推行了“预防第一，治疗第二”的政策。这项政策的成功，就由于培植政府与人民间合作的途径，将城市中的医药人员组织起来，动员群众来参加健康运动。
    主要是依靠城市中一般人民去推动。如同沈阳便培养了一万一千名卫生工作的积极分子。他们带头提倡清理垃圾，灭蝇和从事其他清洁工作。
    一样重要的是推动医务人员实行“将医药带给人民”的原则，每个卫生人员都负责他那一区的某项卫生工作。
    另外一个重大设施是设立妇婴卫生站，以减少婴儿死亡率，并增进妇孺的福利。看到这种工作，使我想到我所组织的中国福利会在上海妇女工人中间所做的工作，进行着卫生宣传和教育，训练对儿童的保育，产前产后的检验和接生。
    东北卫生工作总结他们的经验教训时，有下列几点：
    １、在进行群众规模的卫生工作时，必须与市政府，共产党和公安机构合作。
    ２、建立基层卫生组织时，事先训练是有效的，动员基层人员是必要的。
    ３、参加的医生是卫生机构的栋梁，因为他们是卫生机构与基层积极分子之间的桥梁。
    ４、人民一旦认识了卫生工作的重要，他们将要求扩展，并且要自己主持一部分。但是各级的指导和经常的鼓励仍是必需的。
    我们发现东北城市中的人民对于儿童保育工作，其兴趣一如中国其他各地。他们也明了培植中国的将来，必须把我们的幼童从小便训练起来。许多托儿所在开办着，而且数目经常在增加。许多托儿所的经费是直接来自人民政府，工会及妇女团体。
    照托儿所工作会议的结果，东北的儿童保育工作干部订出了下列几个工作目标：
    １、帮助儿童取得正确的劳动观点，使他们明了劳动创造了一切财富，所以应当爱好劳动。
    ２、用饶有趣味的工作计划去培养儿童的智慧。
    ３、帮助儿童发展新道德，即爱我们的祖国，爱我们的领袖，爱我们的人民，爱劳动，爱护人民的财产。
    ４、通过好习惯及预防工作的教育，帮助儿童养成并维持优良的健康。

    东北在文化教育工作上的进步，说明了人民有了政权以后，这些工作可以得到怎样伟大的发展。
    小学校现在已增加到三四、○○○所，有学生四、五七六、一一一名。这个数字是包括了农村儿童的。中学在一九五○年比一九四九年超出了百分之二十一。学生数目也增加了百分之三十八，已有一五五、七四八名。此外，有六十一所职业学校，和许多特别为工农阶级干部而设的速成学校。东北有十六所新型的高等教育机构，为训练技术工人，包括财政经济系或课程。目前，有一七、九七八名学生在这种大学及学院中攻读。
    配合着正规学校，还有扫除东北劳动人民中间文盲的庞大运动，加起来共有四、五○○、○○○农民参加了类似的课程。
    自然所有这些教育工作都创造了对出版物的要求。一九五○年度，新华书店共印了四千多万册新书。同时，东北建立了遐迩四达的发行网，售卖书籍，杂志，报章及其他出版物。
    这样提倡了智识和教育的结果怎样呢？以旅大区为例。解放以前，该地人口三分之一是文盲。一九四九，当消灭文盲运动刚开始时，二十万人报名学习了。其中，五万人已经毕业。工人的识字标准是认一千二百个字，一般市民认一千个字，农民认八百个字。
    在学童中，中学生人数比日本沦陷期间增加了百分之二六六·五，小学生人数增加了百分之二一七·九。同时，这些城市已有了课程完备的大学。还有直接设在工厂车间中的职业学校。工人们有一座文化宫，九所文化馆，九十二所文化俱乐部及三三二所文化站。
    我们在大连参观的一所叫做“工人之家”的便是一个典型的文化机构。实际上这是大连运输公司工人们的家庭，学校和文化宫。在这些工人中，一半是妇女。
    这个公司的口号是“工厂就是学校”。这种不断提高工作的精神也传布到他们的“工人之家”。工作是分为三班，因此，这个“家”也昼夜充满着年青人。他们在那里作业余学习，和他们的职业学校。他们骄傲地告诉你：大连运输公司的经理和学校校长都是“工人之家”的毕业生，都是从工人中间提拔出来的。
    “工人之家”是用合作社的利润设立的。他们置了一所陈旧而破烂的学校，而凭了他们的义务劳动，把它变成为一所宫殿。有交谊室、娱乐室、运动场、图书馆、课堂、浴室、和一间饭厅，并且有一座能容八百人的礼堂。
    我们在东北看见了许多这样的文化机构，并且也参观了旅顺的东方文化博物院及战史博物院。在每个地方，工人不是实际上参加建筑工程的一部分，就是工程的全部，或者便是在经营着那个机构。在每个地方，我们都看见新中国的人民在学习着，享受着一种短短几年以前他们所不可能梦想到的生活。这种生活使得他们更急于对祖国的茁长和繁荣有所贡献，使得他们坚决地要用他们所有的勇敢和热爱来保卫它。
  结论
    总结一下我从东北所得的主要印象罢：
    帝国主义，官僚资本，军阀割据，国民党的腐败政权都已经完全摧毁了。代之而起的，是一个真正的人民政权。
    这使得土地改革可以完成并获到巩固。东北的农民再也不会回到过去受压迫，封建，贫匮的日子了。他们已走上了集体努力的道路，走上了导入社会主义时代的新民主主义的道路。
    这使得城市的工人阶级解放了他们的创造才能。加上苏联专家在真正国际主义精神下的协助，他们正迅速地重建着工业，为了它在新民主主义时代的未来发展打下了一个基础——新民主主义时代是走向完全组织起来的、高度效率的社会主义时代的工业的准备时期。
    这使得农民和工人都能享受不断提高的生活水平，物质上得到利益，文化上长足地进步。我们灵敏而富创造性的人民正被改造为新民主主义的公民，逐渐变成为社会主义时代的先进的人。
    东北证明了新中国确实是在朝着它光辉的未来，向前迈进。（按：本文系为“人民中国”而作）（附图片）
