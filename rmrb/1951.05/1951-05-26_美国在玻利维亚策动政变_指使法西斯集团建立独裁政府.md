　　Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: On May 16th, a fascist coup took place in Bolivia, a famous tin-producing country in South America. The military group headed by General Barrientos, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, defied popular will and arbitrarily announced its rule, establishing a military-controlled dictatorial government.

　　This coup is the result of the deepening crisis of U.S. rule in Latin America. It shows that in the face of the rising national independence movements of the people of Latin American countries, U.S. imperialism has had to take increasingly direct intervention measures to maintain its position.

　　On May 6th, Bolivia held presidential elections. Presidential candidate Estenssoro, leader of the Bolivian Socialist Party, who was in exile in Buenos Aires due to persecution, was supported by progressives throughout the country. His campaign slogan was: "Liberate Bolivia from the United States; nationalize tin mines, railways, and social welfare undertakings; and distribute land."

　　Although under the undemocratic electoral system, only 5 percent of the Bolivian people had the right to vote, and only about 60 percent of the voters cast their ballots due to the police's terroristic suppression. However, the results near the end of the election showed that Estenssoro had obtained 41 percent of the votes, a figure far exceeding the other candidates, even though it did not reach the statutory absolute majority. In this situation, U.S. imperialism and the Bolivian reactionaries were greatly alarmed. Therefore, before the final election results were announced, the Bolivian ambassador to Washington, Weigas, immediately consulted with Miller, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Latin American affairs, and instructed the Bolivian reactionaries to arrange a coup. On the 16th, President Urriolagoitia, on the pretext of so-called "preventing the threat of communism," announced his abdication and handed over power to the army. He then instructed Barrientos to immediately form his military dictatorship, declare martial law throughout the country, ban strikes and demonstrations, and implement partial military mobilization.

　　The U.S. imperialism's brutal interference in the Bolivian people will arouse even stronger resistance from the Bolivian people. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine admitted that the matter was not over, and that "greater storms" would occur in Bolivia. Those voters who support anti-American parties, especially tin miners, may create an "unstable situation."

　　The coup instigated by U.S. imperialism has also aroused widespread indignation in other Latin American countries. The Argentine newspaper "El Tiempo" vehemently criticized the U.S. State Department's interference in the "internal affairs of an independent country" as "extremely shameful."

　　美国在玻利维亚策动政变
    指使法西斯集团建立独裁政府
    【新华社二十四日讯】五月十六日，南美洲著名的产锡国家玻利维亚发生了法西斯政变。以巴里万将军为首的军事集团在美帝国主义指使下，违反民意，擅自宣布执政，建立了军人包办的独裁政府。
    这个政变是美国对拉丁美洲统治的危机加深的结果，它表明了在拉丁美洲各国人民高涨着的民族独立运动面前，美帝国主义已不得不采取愈来愈直接的干涉办法，来维持自己的地位了。
    五月六日，玻利维亚举行了总统选举。总统候选人，因受迫害而流亡在布宜诺斯艾利斯的玻利维亚社会党领袖艾斯顿索罗受到全国进步人士的拥护。他的竞选口号是：“摆脱美国而使玻利维亚获得自由；把锡矿、铁路和社会福利事业收归国有；分配土地。”
    虽然在不民主的选举制度下，玻利维亚人民只有百分之五有选举权，而且由于警察的恐怖镇压，只有约百分之六十的选民投了票。但是，选举接近结束时的结果显示，艾斯顿索罗竟得到了百分之四十一的选票，这个数字虽然还不到法定的绝对多数，却远远超过其他的候选人以上。在这种情形下，美帝国主义与玻利维亚反动派大感惊慌不安。因此，不等选举结果最后揭晓，玻利维亚驻华盛顿大使魏加斯就立即向美国负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿米勒请示机宜；并指使玻利维亚反动派布置政变。十六日，总统乌里奥拉高提亚即借口所谓“防止共产主义的威胁”，宣布自己下野而把政权交给陆军。并指使巴里万马上组成了它的军事独裁政府，并宣布全国戒严，禁止罢工示威，和实行部分军事动员。
    美帝国主义对玻利维亚人民的横暴干涉，将激起玻利维亚人民更强烈的反抗。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志承认事情并不是就此结束，玻利维亚还要发生“更大的风波”，那些支持反美政党的选民们，尤其是锡矿矿工们可能造成“不安的局势”。
    美帝国主义所策动的这次政变在拉丁美洲其他国家也引起了广泛的愤慨。阿根廷《时代报》猛烈抨击美国国务院这样干涉“独立国的内政”是“极端可耻的”。
