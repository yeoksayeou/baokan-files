　　Resolutely Safeguard Women's Human Rights
    More Than 600 Homicides of Women Occurred in Shanxi Province Last Year; Relevant Leading Organs Should Pay Attention to This Issue

Editor:
    In some areas of Shanxi Province, insufficient attention is being paid to safeguarding women's human rights. Cases of women being abused and murdered, and being forced to commit suicide are still quite numerous. In the past year alone, according to the 936 homicide cases handled by people's courts at all levels in the province, cases of women being abused and murdered or forced to commit suicide accounted for more than 66%. This is indeed a serious problem.
    Why is this situation occurring? According to my understanding, it is mainly because some district and village cadres do not attach importance to the Marriage Law and do not handle marriage issues in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law. Take a few things in the second district of Xin County as an example: Jiao Jin'e, a woman from Qianhao Village, filed for divorce with the village cadres because she could not bear the abuse of her husband. The village chief tied her up for this reason, and her husband beat her severely with a belt, leaving Jiao Jin'e bedridden for seven days. Jia Yulian from Miaozhuang was sold as a child bride from a young age, and the couple's relationship was not harmonious. She went to the district government several times to request a divorce, but the district cadres did not resolve it reasonably based on the actual situation. After returning home, she was unreasonably insulted by her mother-in-law, and therefore committed suicide by taking poison. These events aroused dissatisfaction among some women towards the government. They said, "Since the government allows divorce, it should stand up for us. After suffering so many years of abuse, are we still supposed to let us women die unjustly today?"
    Secondly, it is because some judicial organs have not promptly dealt with cases of abuse and murder of women appropriately, thereby fueling the wrong ideas and illegal actions of some people. The handling of the case of Qu Guangzhong of Fanglan Village beating his wife to death by the judicial organs of Dingxiang County is the best explanation. Why did Qu Guangzhong beat his wife to death? Because his wife asked for a divorce. In the case of such a human life, the judicial organs only sentenced him to five years in prison. Therefore, among some backward masses, there is this idea: "If she dares to divorce, killing her won't cost me my life. At worst, I'll be sentenced to two years in prison, and I can still go home to produce after serving my sentence." This is the evil result caused by the deviation of judicial work.
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Marriage Law, I would like to report to you the deviations in the implementation of the Marriage Law that I know, so as to attract the attention of the relevant leading organs.

### 切实保障妇女人权  去年山西省发生妇女命案六百余件有关领导机关应注意这个问题

　　切实保障妇女人权
    去年山西省发生妇女命案六百余件有关领导机关应注意这个问题编辑同志：
    山西省有些地区不注意保障妇女的人权，妇女被虐杀与被迫自杀的事件还相当多。在去年一年中，仅据该省各级人民法院受理之九百三十六件命案中，妇女被虐杀与被迫自杀的事件即占百分之六十六强。这的确是一个严重的问题。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？据我了解：主要是由于某些区村干部不重视婚姻法，没有依据婚姻法的精神来处理婚姻问题。就拿忻县二区的几件事来看吧：前郝村妇女焦金蛾，因为不堪忍受他丈夫的虐待，向村干部提出了离婚的要求。该村村长为此就把她捆了起来；她丈夫又用皮带毒打一顿，焦金蛾被打得七天起不了床。苗庄贾玉莲从小被卖作童养媳，夫妇感情不和。她数次到区政府要求离婚，区干部不根据实际情况予以合理解决；回家后又遭受婆婆的无理侮骂，因而服毒自杀。这些事情激起部分妇女对政府的不满。她们说：“政府既允许离婚，就该给我们作主。我们受了这么多年的虐待，到今天还要叫我们妇女含冤自杀？”
    其次是因为有些司法机关对虐杀妇女的案件，没有及时予以适当处理，因而助长了某些人的错误思想和非法行为。定襄县司法机关对芳兰村曲光中打死老婆一案的处理，就是一个最好的说明。曲光中为什么要打死他的老婆呢？因为他老婆提出要离婚。这样一条人命的案件，司法机关仅仅判了他五年徒刑。因此，在一部分落后群众中，就存在着这种思想：“她敢离婚，杀了她也不会偿命。大不了判上二年徒刑，还可以带罪回家生产。”这就是因为司法工作的偏差而引起的恶果。
    在婚姻法公布一周年的时候，特将我所知道的有关执行婚姻法的偏差情况反映给你，以便引起有关领导机关的注意。
