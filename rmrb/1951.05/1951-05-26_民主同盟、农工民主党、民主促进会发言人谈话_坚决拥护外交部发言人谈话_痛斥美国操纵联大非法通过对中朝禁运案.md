Statements by Spokespersons of the China Democratic League, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy

Firmly Support the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's Statement

Vigorously Denounce the United States for Manipulating the UN General Assembly to Illegally Pass the Embargo Proposal Against China and North Korea

[Our Newspaper] The spokesperson of the headquarters of the China Democratic League issued a statement regarding the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the embargo proposal against China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stating in brief: Under the manipulation of the United States, the UN General Assembly passed the illegal resolution proposed by the United States to implement an embargo against our country and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on May 18th. This once again demonstrates that the United Nations has degenerated into a tool of aggression for the American imperialists. It further proves that the American imperialists are expanding their war of aggression. The spokesperson stated: Everyone knows that this illegal resolution of the General Assembly cannot have any effect. Because ever since the flag of the United Nations was stolen by the American imperialists to invade Korea, the moral authority of the United Nations has been swept away. After it passed the illegal decision on February 1st, falsely accusing our country of being an "aggressor," the so-called prestige of the United Nations was completely bankrupt. Now, the American imperialists are manipulating the passage of such an illegal proposal, which people all over the world simply scoff at. The spokesperson stated: We hope that people all over the world will face the facts pointed out by our Foreign Ministry spokesperson: This illegal resolution is merely a conspiracy by the American imperialists to undermine the international market, monopolize military raw materials, and control the economic lifelines of their vassal states. The result will only be to increase the internal contradictions of the aggressive bandits and accelerate their own destruction. The Chinese people have full confidence and strength to smash the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracies. The Chinese people must make the American imperialists and all their accomplices who follow them bear all the consequences of their hostility towards our country.

[Our Newspaper] The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, in support of our Foreign Ministry spokesperson's statement regarding the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the resolution to implement an embargo against our country and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recently issued a written statement, stating in brief: On May 18th, under the manipulation and hijacking by the US government, the UN General Assembly, disregarding the opposition of countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and India, illegally passed the American proposal to impose an embargo on our country and Korea. This illegal resolution fully illustrates that the US government, in order to salvage the final defeat of its invading troops on the Korean battlefield, is forcing its accomplice countries to take risks. The so-called embargo against China and Korea is an important step by the US government in attempting to expand its war of aggression. The UN General Assembly's illegal passage of this American proposal once again proves that it has irretrievably become a tool for the imperialist bloc headed by the United States to expand its war of aggression. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party firmly opposes this illegal and shameful resolution of the UN General Assembly and firmly supports the statement of our Foreign Ministry spokesperson. At the same time, we fully believe that the people of the whole country can respond to this shameful resolution with the fact of thoroughly defeating the American aggressors.

[Our Newspaper] The spokesperson of the China Association for Promoting Democracy recently issued a statement denouncing the United States for manipulating the UN General Assembly to illegally pass the embargo proposal against China and North Korea. It stated: The great victory of the patriotic struggle waged by the Chinese and Korean people against the American imperialist aggressors is not only a victory for the Chinese and Korean people themselves but also a victory for all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. The American imperialists' manipulation of the UN General Assembly to illegally pass the embargo proposal against the Chinese and Korean people only exposes the weakness of the American imperialists at the end of their rope and proves once again that the American imperialists are the mortal enemies of the Chinese and Korean people and the mortal enemies of the people of the world, making people all over the world more clearly aware that the United Nations has completely become a shameful tool for imperialism to expand its war of aggression. The Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in Asia and the world will inevitably unite more closely. Any accomplice country that dares to follow the American imperialists in opposing the Chinese people and opposing all peace-loving people in Asia and the world, let it bear all the consequences it deserves!

　　民主同盟、农工民主党、民主促进会发言人谈话
    坚决拥护外交部发言人谈话
    痛斥美国操纵联大非法通过对中朝禁运案
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟总部发言人为联合国大会非法通过对中朝两国实行禁运提案，发表谈话略称：联合国大会在美国操纵之下，于五月十八日通过了美国提出的对我国和对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国实行禁运的非法决议。这又一次说明了联合国已堕落为美帝国主义者的侵略工具。更证明了美帝国主义者正在扩大侵略战争。该发言人称：联大的这一非法决议，谁都知道它不能发生任何效力的。因为从联合国的旗帜被美帝国主义盗用侵略朝鲜以来，联合国的道德力量即已扫地。今年二月一日它通过诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的非法决定之后，所谓联合国的威信更是彻底破产。现在美帝国主义者操纵通过如此非法提案，全世界人民只是嗤之以鼻而已。发言人称：我们希望全世界人民正视我外交部发言人所指出的事实：这个非法决议只是美帝国主义者破坏国际市场、独占军火原料以控制仆从国家的经济命脉的一个阴谋诡计。结果只是增强侵略强盗们的内部矛盾，促进他们自身的毁灭而已。中国人民有充分的信心和力量来粉碎美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。中国人民必得让美帝国主义者和一切追随它的帮凶们自食其敌视我国的全部后果。
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党为拥护我外交部发言人对于联合国大会非法通过对我国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国实行禁运的决议，顷发表书面谈话，略称：联合国大会于五月十八日在美国政府操纵和劫持之下，不顾苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度等国的反对，非法通过对我国和朝鲜实行禁运的美国提案。这个非法决议充分地说明美国政府为了挽救其侵略军队在朝鲜战场最后失败的命运，正逼使其帮凶国家挺而走险，所谓对中朝两国的禁运也就是美国政府企图扩大侵略战争的一个重要步骤。联合国大会非法通过美国这一提案，再一次证明它已不可挽救地变成以美国为首的帝国主义集团扩大侵略战争的工具。中国农工民主党坚决反对联合国大会这个非法的可耻的决议，并坚决拥护我外交部发言人的谈话。同时完全相信全国人民是能用彻底战胜美国侵略者的事实来回答这个可耻的决议的。
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会发言人顷发表谈话，斥责美国操纵联大非法通过对中朝禁运案。内称：中国人民和朝鲜人民对美帝国主义侵略者所进行的爱国斗争的伟大胜利。不仅是中朝人民自己的胜利，也是全亚洲以及全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。美帝国主义一手操纵联合国大会非法通过对中朝人民禁运案，只是又一次暴露了美帝国主义途穷技拙的弱点，又一次证明美帝国主义是中朝人民的死敌，是全世界人民的死敌，使全世界人民更清楚地认识联合国完全变为帝国主义扩大侵略战争的可耻工具。中朝人民和全亚洲全世界爱好和平人民必然更加团结一致。一切胆敢追随美帝国主义敌视中国人民和敌视全亚洲全世界爱好和平的人民的帮凶国家，就让它负起全部应得的后果罢！
