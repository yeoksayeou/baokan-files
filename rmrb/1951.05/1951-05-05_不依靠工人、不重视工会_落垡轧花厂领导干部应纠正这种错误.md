　　Not Relying on Workers, Not Valuing Trade Unions
    Leaders and Cadres of Luofa Cotton Ginning Factory Should Correct This Mistake

To the Editor:

    The administrative leaders and cadres of the Luofa Station Cotton Ginning Factory, under the Langfang Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, do not rely on the workers and do not value the trade union law. As a result, the various rights and interests of the workers are not properly protected, which seriously hinders the production enthusiasm of the workers. After the Spring Festival this year, due to the ginning of inferior red cotton, fibers flew everywhere, affecting the health of the workers. The workers requested masks. This request was very reasonable, but the administration delayed issuing them. The masks were still not issued even after the red cotton was completely ginned. Last year, the higher-level company had already approved the issuance of work clothes, but the factory refused to implement it and it has not been resolved until now. In order to improve their culture, the workers organize cultural studies during their evening rest time, but the administration often encroaches on the workers' cultural study time, which the workers are very dissatisfied with. The factory leaders and cadres have a wrong understanding of the trade union. Factory Director He Shengtang publicly stated at a meeting of Party and Youth League members: "Our factory's trade union representative Wang Jiasheng has been used by the Wuqing County Federation of Trade Unions. The Wuqing County Federation of Trade Unions specializes in sowing discord among cadres." Deputy Factory Director Liu Jianzhang even instructed staff member Xu Zhenhuai to "monitor" Wang Jiasheng, preventing him from getting close to the cadres of the County Federation of Trade Unions. After the higher-level administrative leaders discovered this problem, they sent people to the factory to investigate, but no appropriate action was taken; finally, without going through the trade union, Wang Jiasheng was transferred back to the company, causing the factory's trade union to collapse.
    These erroneous measures have suppressed the enthusiasm of the factory's workers, and production naturally cannot be done well. We believe that this serious ideological style of detachment from the working class should be corrected in a timely manner, otherwise, it will be detrimental to the development of the factory. We hope that the relevant authorities can conduct an in-depth investigation and deal with it.

### 不依靠工人、不重视工会  落垡轧花厂领导干部应纠正这种错误

　　不依靠工人、不重视工会
    落垡轧花厂领导干部应纠正这种错误编辑同志：
    中国花纱布公司廊坊支公司落垡车站轧花厂的行政领导干部，不依靠工人，不重视工会法，结果，职工的各种权益得不到应有的保障，严重地妨碍了职工的生产积极性。今年春节后，该厂因轧次红花，纤维飞扬，影响工人健康，工人要求发口罩。这种要求是很合理的，但行政上却拖延不发，一直到红花轧完，口罩仍未发下。去年，上级公司已允许发工作服，该厂却拒不执行，直到现在也没解决。职工们为了提高文化，利用晚上休息时间组织文化学习，行政上却经常侵占职工文化学习时间，职工对此很不满意。该厂领导干部对工会的认识是错误的。厂长贺升堂在党、团员的会议上曾公开说过：“咱们工厂工会代表王家声被武清县总工会利用了。武清县工会是专挑拨干部团结的。”副厂长刘建章竟指使职员徐振怀将王家声“监视起来”，不让他和县总工会干部接近。上级行政领导上发觉这个问题后，曾派人来厂调查，但也没有作适当处理；最后没有通过工会，即将王家声调回公司，使工厂工会垮了台。
    这些错误措施压抑了该厂职工的积极性，生产自然就搞不好了。我们认为这种严重的脱离工人阶级的错误思想和作风，应该及时纠正，否则，对工厂的发展是不利的。希望有关机关能深入调查处理。
