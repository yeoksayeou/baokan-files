Talking about London in the Bitter Wind and Rain
——First Travelogue in Britain——
Wu Wentao

　　After circling a few times, the plane flashed a message telling passengers to fasten their seatbelts, and then suddenly plunged into cotton-like clouds. The Czechoslovak Airlines attendant came out of the cockpit and said kindly: "This is London, the weather is often so bad. We are landing!"

　　In the summer of 1948, I visited London. At that time, in just three days, I hoped to get a concept of this city of eight million residents. The mansions in the central area and the rows of father-son limited companies were certainly eye-catching; in the underground train stations or on the double-decker buses, and in the ruins and traffic corners left on the streets due to the bombing by Hitler's planes during World War II, you could see colorful advertisements and commercial signs everywhere. Besides the word "profit," nothing else can be found in the "Western civilization" that the imperialists want to defend.

　　At that time, the Marshall Plan's "aid" to Western Europe still seemed to have some sweet taste of imagination for many naive people. The right-wing leaders of the Labor Party were still distributing their fake "socialism" to the people. But the world is changing, so what is London like three years later?

　　Stepping out of the plane, a gust of wind wrapped in rain hit me, making it difficult to walk. The island weather in late February was a real prank for visitors from the mainland who were not used to carrying umbrellas.

　　I and two other passengers were led to the "Immigration Bureau" and customs at Northolt Airport. Three men in plainclothes asked the two passengers about their origins and let them go. A man with a small mustache flipped through my passport and asked what business I was in and what I was doing in England. I said, "I am representing the People's Daily to attend the 21st anniversary celebration of the British Workers' Daily." Another man with glasses and one with a fleshy face glanced at my small handbag and asked if I had any valuables. I told the one with glasses to check it himself. At this time, the man with the fleshy face asked if I had any documents in my pocket. I said, "Yes, very important!" I then pulled out a Xinhua News Agency English draft of Premier Zhou's denunciation of the United Nations for slandering China as an "aggressor" and the English translation of my speech prepared for the Workers' Daily anniversary meeting, and told him, "Asking about things in my pocket is an abnormal and unfriendly act similar to a body search." At this time, he put on a fox face and repeatedly explained, "This is just a formality, a formality!" He then took the two documents aside to consult with his companions. The one with glasses took out a roll of Chinese materials from my bag, which were proof sheets of reports on improving the People's Daily by comrades such as Fan Changjiang and Deng Tuo. He probably didn't understand Chinese and repeatedly flipped through them for a long time before asking what the documents were. I replied, "Take it and translate it into English, preferably publish it in The Times!" Then, he fell silent.

　　It took a full forty minutes before I could pack up all the materials and pass through customs.

　　The representative of the Workers' Daily, Asaf Kreig, and other friends who were waiting in the waiting room to greet me, had already suspected that I, like the representatives from various countries who went to England to attend meetings at the end of last year, had been forced to fly back as soon as I got off the plane. After a brief exchange of greetings with the friends who came to greet me, a friend asked me if I had read Marshal Stalin's conversation with the Pravda reporter in the newspaper that day. I immediately turned to the newspaper distribution point with the words "W.H. Smith & Son" written on it, wanting to buy a copy of the Workers' Daily. But the answer I got was "No." Later, I learned that a large part of the distribution of newspapers in London was contracted by this Smith company. These companies do not sell Workers' Daily at retail, except for a few long-term subscribers. What is the reason? Only the bosses know.

　　Since they didn't sell Workers' Daily, I had to buy a few copies of the London bourgeois newspapers of that day (February 17th), and hurriedly got into the car with my friends, braving the rain to head towards the city. On the side of the first page of the Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph, there was an abstract of Marshal Stalin's conversation; parallel to it were news of more than a dozen kinds of daily necessities that had increased in price by one-tenth compared to the previous week. The headline news of the day was the railway workers' strike due to the Labor Party government's railway management authorities' rejection of their demand for a 10% wage increase. Because the Labor Party government invoked the so-called "Order 1305," a wartime law prohibiting strikes that should have been abolished long ago, and arrested seven representatives of dockworkers who demanded a wage increase, the strike movement in London and other ports was in full swing. The high cost of living in England is seriously threatening all people. Not long ago, even the King himself felt that life was not easy and asked the cabinet to increase his subsidy. Immediately, the Labor Party government decided to add 40,000 pounds (equal to the annual income of 160 ordinary workers) to his annual subsidy of hundreds of thousands of pounds. But what about the workers?………

　　Also in the same day's editorial entitled "The Cause of Labor Unrest," the Daily Telegraph admitted: "The basic reason for these grievances (referring to the workers' strike) is naturally the relentless rise in the cost of living." The Daily Telegraph, as the mouthpiece of the Conservative Party, warned: "Unless the High Court stops the rising tide of industrial unrest, it will be a serious threat to rearmament!"

　　Let's look at Marshal Stalin's conversation:

　　"Prime Minister Attlee should understand from his own and American experience that increasing the army and engaging in arms expansion will expand the military industry, reduce the civil industry, halt huge civil construction projects, increase taxes, and raise the prices of consumer goods."

　　What a penetrating remark! However, the Labor Party's organ, the Daily Herald, on the same day, said that this conversation was a personal attack on Attlee!

　　Half an hour later, we got out of the car in front of a friend's house. The hostess brewed a cup of hot coffee to drink, but the oppressive cold still did not recede. Coal is of poor quality, and it is still difficult for ordinary families to buy it. It was already noon, and another friend invited us to his house for dinner, saying that he could take out a whole month's ration of meat (equivalent to a little more than one catty in China) and a whole month's ration of eggs (three) to treat us to a more substantial meal. Everyone couldn't help but smile bitterly. At present, the amount of meat rationed to each person in the UK is half less than in the most difficult years of World War II. Of course, wealthy bosses can buy chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and can eat everything in large restaurants. This is the same as the clothes that have been de-rationed. A set that cost eight pounds last October has already exceeded ten and a half pounds today. How dare the workers who are fighting with the tycoons to increase their wages by a few shillings even ask about it?

　　Because I didn't feel hungry yet, I made an appointment with Sam (a friend's name) to go to the "East End" (the slums of London) to take a look first. The rain turned into gusts at this time, and the sun occasionally showed its head, only to be obscured by passing clouds. We hired a car from the most prosperous Piccadilly Street, roughly along the north bank of the River Thames, passing through Fleet Street, the "City" district of London, and heading east all the way. Since the publications of the British bourgeois newspaper tycoons are mostly concentrated in Fleet Street, the name of this street has become a synonym for reactionary propaganda. Speaking of the "City" of London, there is no city wall like in China. Its characteristic lies in the imposing Bank of England, which can be hundreds of feet in size, and other countless money houses. This is the "empire" of British monopoly capitalists, just like Wall Street is to American monopoly capitalists. However, not far from this "empire," there is Grosvenor Square, where a large number of houses have now become the offices of American people. Walking from there is like being in Washington. The US's what "Economic Cooperation Administration" and "Headquarters" in London show the face of the American master reigning over everything. At the same time, this also shows the fierce open and secret struggles between the "City" district of London and Wall Street within the scope of the capitalist world.

　　From the "City" district to the "East End," you have arrived in another world, although the car ride is only a few tens of minutes. The dilapidated houses looked even more desolate in the damp weather. The wreckage of houses destroyed during the war is still left there intact in many places. This is the area where London's workers have lived for generations. A family of eight is crowded into a small room. Workers with an average weekly wage of just over five pounds have to spend two-fifths of it on food and about one-fifth of their income on rent. The housing shortage is so serious that an advertisement for a house for rent receives one hundred and seventy-eight applications for rent within one day (Workers' Daily, February 12). According to the latest statistics from the London municipal authorities, there are 200,388 families in Greater London alone who are registered and waiting to find a house to get married or have a son with nowhere to sleep. Build houses? That is, for the reactionary bourgeoisie, not as important as armaments. During World War II, 170,000 houses were destroyed in London alone. Those British people who have nowhere to live are filled with anger at the warmongers' calls for war.

　　Because our clothes were all wet, we changed to a bus to go back; we got off at Trafalgar Square in the central area and visited the memorial statue of Nelson (referring to the British Admiral at the end of the 18th century). If Nelson's victory at Trafalgar was a symbol of the beginning of the golden age of the British Empire that "ruled the seven seas," then today, under the Atlantic invasion treaty, "Nelson's Navy" has been reduced to a flank of the US imperialist navy. On January 14, the day after Eisenhower arrived in London, a large number of veterans (officers and soldiers under Eisenhower's command in World War II) gathered at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with medals won in the war against Hitler, laid wreaths, and sent representatives to write to Eisenhower, expressing: The British people do not want war, please let him and the American army, navy, and air force now on the British Isles go home! They also planned to hold a demonstration in front of Nelson's memorial statue, but it was unreasonably stopped by the police. According to reports, on February 25, the British veterans' organization will also hold a meeting in this Trafalgar Square. Their slogans are: oppose being recalled into the army, oppose rearming West Germany, and oppose expanding the war of aggression against Korea to China. Unfortunately, because I had to leave the UK on the 23rd, I was unable to attend this grand event.

　　Around 3:00 PM, the cold combined with hunger made me shiver a little, so I found a restaurant called "Hong Kong House" and planned to eat some Chinese-flavored hot soup. A Cantonese compatriot in his twenties warmly greeted us in a northern accent. Meeting in a foreign country made us feel particularly cordial. We each ordered a large bowl of chicken noodle soup, and the young Cantonese waiter specially brought us some Chinese soy sauce and pepper powder, and eating it made us feel exceptionally comfortable, as if we had returned to our motherland.

　　Walking to the apartment in the dim twilight, I turned on the radio, and the BBC was reporting the news: the London dockworkers' strike has expanded again, and the negotiations on the railway resumption issue have failed.... The weather forecast for the next day is still bitter wind and rain!

　　凄风苦雨话伦敦
    ——旅英纪实之一——
    吴文焘
    飞机兜了几个圈子，闪出让旅客们系紧安全带的字幕后，便骤然沉入棉絮般的云雾里去。捷克航空公司的招待员从机房里走出来，亲切地说：“这就是伦敦，天气常是这样坏的。我们在降落了！”
    一九四八年的夏天，我曾到过伦敦。当时，在短短的三天里，我希望能对这八百万居民的城市有个概念。中心区的豪门大厦和栉比的父子有限公司，当然是引人注目的；在地下火车站或地上的两层公共汽车上，以及由于二次大战期间希特勒飞机的轰炸至今还存留在街道上的断壁残垣和交通要道的墙角上，你所看到的，到处是五光十色的广告画和商业招牌。帝国主义者所要保卫的“西方文明”，除了利润二字以外，再也找不出什么别的来。
    当时，马歇尔的“援助”西欧计划，对于很多天真的人们，还似乎有些想像的甜蜜味道。工党的右派领袖们，还在向人民配售其假冒的“社会主义”。可是世界在变化着，三年后的伦敦到底怎样了呢？
    走出飞机，疾风卷着急雨，打得人行走不得。二月下旬的岛国天气，对于不惯带伞的大陆来客，真是一个恶作剧。
    我和另外两位旅客被引到诺索尔特航空站的“移民局”和海关去。三位穿便衣的汉子问明了那两位旅客的来历，便把他们放行了。一个有小胡子的汉子翻阅着我的护照，问是做什么生意的，到英国来干什么？我说：“是代表人民日报来参加英国工人日报二十一周年庆祝会的。”另外一个带眼镜的和一个满脸横肉的，打量了一下我的小手提包，问有什么贵重物品？我告诉那带眼镜的自己去检查。这时那满脸横肉的汉子就问我口袋里可有什么文件？我说：“有，可重要呢！”随手就从口袋里掏出了一份登着周总理痛斥联合国污蔑中国为“侵略者”的声明的新华社英文稿，和准备在工人日报纪念会上讲话的英译稿，并告诉他：“问口袋里的东西，是类似搜身的反常的不友好举动。”这时他又摆出一副狐狸脸，连连解释说：“这只是形式，形式！”他于是拿着两个文件，到一边和他的同伙们去会商了。那带眼镜的从我提包里检出了一卷中文材料，是范长江和邓拓等同志关于改进人民日报的报告清样。他大概是不懂中文的，反复翻阅了好久，才问是什么文件，我回答说：“你拿去把它译成英文吧，最好能在《太晤士》报上登载一下！”于是，他不响了。
    足足有四十分钟，我才得收拾好全部材料，通过了海关。
    工人日报的代表阿塞·克列格和其他几位在候客室等候迎接我的朋友，已在怀疑我是否也像去年年底去英国开会的各国和大代表一样，下了飞机就被迫飞回去了。和来迎的朋友们欢晤寒暄了一会，一个朋友问我是否读过当天报上斯大林大元帅对真理报记者的谈话？我立刻就转到旁边写着“斯米司父子有限公司”字样的派报所，想买一份工人日报。但所得的回答，却是“没有”。后来，我才知道全伦敦报纸的派售很大一部分是这个斯米司公司包办的。这类公司，除了少数长期订阅户外，并不零售工人日报。什么原因呢？那只有老板们知道。
    既然不卖工人日报，我只得买了几份当天（二月十七日）的伦敦的资产阶级报纸，匆匆和朋友们上了车，冒着雨向城里进发。在保守党《每日电讯》报第一版的边上，登着斯大林大元帅谈话的摘要；和它平行的，是十数种日用品较上周又涨价十分之一的新闻。这天的头条新闻，是各地铁路工人因要求增资十分之一，被工党政府的铁路管理当局拒绝而罢工的事件。由于工党政府援引了早该废除的战时制止罢工的所谓“一○三五”号法案，将七个要求增资的码头工人代表拘捕起来，伦敦和其他各港口的罢工运动，正是方兴未艾。英国生活费用的高涨，是这样严重地威胁着所有的人们。不久以前，连英王自己也觉得日子不好过了，要求内阁给他增加补贴。马上，工党政府决定在他一年数十万镑的补贴项下，增加了四万镑（等于一百六十个普通工人的全年收入）。可是，工人们呢？………
    也是同一天的以“工潮的原因”为题的社论里，《每日电讯》报承认：“这些不满（指工人罢工）的基本原因，自然是生活费用的无情高涨。”作为保守党的喉舌的《每日电讯》报警告说：“除非高法制止工业上不安的日益高涨的浪潮，否则将是对重整军备的严重威胁！”
    看看斯大林大元帅的谈话：
    “艾德礼首相应该从他自己及美国的经验中懂得：增加军队和从事军备扩张，就使得军事工业扩大，民用工业减缩，使巨大的民用建设工程停顿，赋税增加，消费品价格上涨。”
    这是何等一针见血的话啊！然而，也是同天的工党机关报《每日先驱》却说这个谈话是对艾德礼的个人攻击！
    半小时后，我们在一个友人的门前下了车。女主人给煮了杯热咖啡吃，但逼人的寒气依然不退。煤，质量坏，一般家庭还难以买到。已是晌午时分了，另一个朋友约去他家吃饭，说是可以拿出一整月的配给肉量（约合中国一斤多）和整月的鸡蛋配给额（三个）来款待一顿较为丰盛的饭。大家都禁不住苦笑起来。目前英国每个人的配给肉量，比第二次大战中最苦的年月还少了一半。当然，有钱的老板们，可以买到鸡鸭鱼肉，可以在大餐馆里吃到一切。这，正和取消了配给制的衣服一样，去年十月八镑一套的，到今天已经超过了十镑半，为了增加几个先令的工资而和大亨们搏斗的工人们，怎敢去问津呢？
    因为还不觉得饿，就约了塞姆（一个朋友的名字）先到“东头”（伦敦的贫民区）去看看。雨，这时变成一阵一阵的，太阳偶尔露露头，就被行云所遮掩起来。我们从最繁华的皮卡德雷大街雇了车，大体是沿着太晤士河北岸，经过伏利特（或译舰队）街，伦敦“城”区，一直朝东走的。由于英国资产阶级报业大王们的刊物大多集中在伏利特街，所以，这条街的名字已经成了反动宣传的代名词。说到伦敦“城”，那里并没有像中国样的城墙，它的特点就在于那方可数百丈、虎视眈眈的英伦银行和其他数不清的钱庄大厦。这是英国独占资本家的“帝国”，犹如华尔街之于美国独占资本家一样。可是，就在这个“帝国”不远的地方，有一条格罗斯文诺街，那里，大批的房子今天已经成了美国人民的机关。从那里走过，就像是到了华盛顿一样。美国在伦敦的什么“经济统制处”、“司令部”，显示出美国主子君临一切的面目。同时，这也说明了，在资本主义世界的范围内，伦敦“城”区和华尔街的激烈的明争暗斗。
    从“城”区到“东头”，你就到了另外的一个世界，虽然汽车行程不过是几十分钟。破旧的房屋，在阴湿的天气里，更显得僻陋不堪。战时被炸毁了的房屋的残骸，很多还原封留在那里。这就是伦敦工人们历代聚居的区域。八口之家，挤在一间狭小的房子里。一周平均不过五镑多工资的工人，除了五分之二用在吃上，还要把约五分之一的收入花在房租上。房荒是这样严重，以致一个房屋出租的小广告登出一天之后，就有一七八家来争租（工人日报二月十二日）。根据最近伦敦市政当局的统计，单在大伦敦登记等着找房子结婚、或者生了儿子没处睡的，就有二○○、三八八家。盖房子吧？那，对于反动的资产阶级来说，不如军备重要。在第二次大战时，仅只伦敦就有十七万所房子被炸毁了。那些无处容身的英国人民，对于战争贩子们的战争叫嚣是怀着满腔的愤怒的。
    因为衣服都淋湿了，我们就改坐公共汽车往回走；在中心区特拉法加广场下车，参观了一下纳尔逊（按为英十八世纪末海军大将）的纪念像。如果说纳尔逊在特拉法加的胜利，是象征着“统治七洋”的大英帝国的黄金时代的开始，那么，今天，在大西洋侵略公约下，“纲尔逊的海军”已经沦为美帝国主义海军的一个侧翼了。一月十四日，在艾森豪威尔到伦敦的第二天，就有大批的退役军人（第二次大战中在艾森豪威尔统帅下的官兵），带着反对希特勒战争中所得的奖章，齐集阵亡将士墓前献花圈，并派代表投书艾森豪威尔，表示：英国人民不要战争，请他和现在英伦三岛的美国海陆空军滚回家去！他们还计划在纳尔逊的纪念像前举行示威大会，但被警察无理制止了。据报载，二月二十五日，英国退役军人的组织，还要在这个特拉法加广场上开会。他们的口号是：反对重新被召入伍，反对重新武装西德，反对扩大侵朝战争到中国。可惜由于我在二十三日必须离英，未能参观这个盛会。
    下午三点多钟的时候，寒冷加上饥饿，使人冷得有些发抖了，就找了一个叫“香港楼”的饭馆，打算吃些中国味道的热汤。一个二十来岁的广东同胞操着北方话热情地来招待我们。异国相逢，倍觉亲切。我们每人要了一大碗鸡丝面，青年广东店员又特意给我们拿出了些中国酱油和胡椒末，吃来顿觉舒快异常，恍若回到了祖国一般。
    在暮色苍茫中走到寓所，打开收音机，英国广播公司正在报告新闻：伦敦码头工人的罢工又扩大了，铁路复工问题谈判失败……。第二天的天气预报，仍然是凄风苦雨！
