　　The True Face of Wu Xun
    ——A Critique of the Film "The Story of Wu Xun," Wu Xun, and Mr. Sun Yu's Self-Criticism
    Ding Mangong
    In his article "My Preliminary Understanding of the Errors I Committed in 'The Story of Wu Xun'" (see page 3 of this newspaper on the 26th of this month), Mr. Sun Yu, the director of the film "The Story of Wu Xun," states: "Regardless of the director's subjective intentions, objective practice has proven that 'The Story of Wu Xun' has had a counter-revolutionary effect of obscuring revolutionary thought on the audience." This intends to instill a confused notion in readers and viewers, suggesting that the author's "subjective intentions" were revolutionary, but the film had a "counter-revolutionary effect." Does this reasoning make sense?
    The author's subjective intentions cannot be explained separately from the objective practice of his creation; this is the most basic theoretical common sense. The subjective intentions of the director of the film "The Story of Wu Xun" have already been expressed in the film; the effect the film has had is by no means a "counter-revolutionary effect" contrary to the author's subjective intentions, but precisely the positive effect that the author's subjective intentions inevitably produce. This is just as Wu Xun's subjective intentions have been fully expressed in the historical facts of his life.
    In the theme song of the film "The Story of Wu Xun," hasn't the author already fully explained his own subjective intentions and guiding ideology? Apart from lamenting "How thin the customs are, the mainland is sinking," expressing despair and curses towards the Chinese people, the author has not included a single sentence that could be "considered a criticism of him" regarding Wu Xun. On the contrary, in this song and many other texts, the author recklessly concentrated all revolutionary vocabulary to praise Wu Xun as the greatest figure in the world.
    Because this kind of thought dominated and permeated the entire film, the film's story structure and character depictions are filled with intolerable, vile images that slander the people, slander the revolution, and slander history, and through all these images, it inflicts great harm on the audience.
    In order to achieve the author's subjective purpose, the film's directing techniques have exhausted the means of distortion and exaggeration. He even went so far as to fabricate a character like Zhou Da, forcibly linking Wu Xun and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, constructing a story that violates historical truth, in which "one is literary and one is martial," conducting revolutions separately; and extremely distorting the Taiping army, portraying them as a group of murderers and arsonists, using their failure to contrast Wu Xun's "success," to negate the class struggle of the oppressed people, and to promote the shameful act of surrendering to the reactionary feudal rulers. The film, under the guise of a dream, sanctifies Wu Xun's delusion of "begging for schooling," and artisticizes the absurd formula that "there is no freedom because there is no culture, and having culture is freedom"; and uses many close-up shots to represent the so-called "tenacity of revolutionary combativeness" with a "tumbler." And the development of this character in the film is that series of kneeling, kowtowing, crawling, and enduring beatings, kicks, and all kinds of humiliation, the "penance." The author attempts to describe all of this extremely reactionary stuff as revolutionary. Can this still be tolerated?
    Some people say: The film "The Story of Wu Xun" is unacceptable; however, the Wu Xun in history and the Wu Xun on the screen are very different. As a historical figure, Wu Xun's contributions to society should not be erased. This statement is obviously unfounded. The film "The Story of Wu Xun" and the history of Wu Xun are essentially the same. The only difference is that the film has dressed Wu Xun up as a "revolutionary" that Wu Xun himself could never have dreamed of, and that is where its poisonous influence lies.
    The historical Wu Xun was undoubtedly a tool used by the Qing rulers to deceive the people. In essence, he belonged to the reactionary feudal class, and definitely not to the laboring people. He long ago sided with the feudal ruling class and abandoned the laboring people. The landlord Li Laobian treated Wu Xun with scolding, beating, and deception, not regarding him as a human being; but the result was not to incite Wu Xun to resist the landlord class, but to cause him to surrender to the landlord class. From that time on, Wu Xun desperately knelt down in front of the landlord class, crawling, crawling, crawling, all the way to the court of the feudal rulers.
    At that time, in Tatou Village, Guantao County, Shandong Province, there was Lou Junling, a Wu Jinshi with the third rank, and in Liulin Town, Tangyi County, there was Yang Shufang, a Jinshi; these two people were representatives of the powerful gentry and landlord class in the local area. Their power was much greater than that of the landlord Li Laobian. After being bullied by the landlord Li Laobian, Wu Xun found these two landlords who were even greater than Li Laobian, knelt before them, begged bitterly, and depended on their power; and through them, he further threw himself into the arms of the entire gentry and landlord class and the Qing rulers. This is the key to Wu Xun's entire historical development, and only from here can we see Wu Xun's true face.
    According to Chen Daiqing's "Biography of Wu Qi," attached to the "Memorial on Behalf of Wu Xun, a Righteous Man Begging for Alms to Establish Schools," from the Tangyi County Government of Shandong Province in the fourteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1888 AD):
        "Wu Qi... dreamed that someone said to him: 'You have been troubled and suffered all your life, without great enjoyment. If you can establish righteous schools, you will have a turning point.' After waking up, he told his dream to Yang Shufang, the age-tribute scholar of Liulin, who said: 'Righteous schools cannot be established empty-handed. You should deposit your money with me later. I will never let you down. Do not listen to the words of others, or you will make a mistake again and again.'"
    Jia Pinzhong's "Epitaph for Wu, a Benevolent Gentleman Named Xun" also says:
        "In the beginning, much of the strength for survival came from Lou, the military scholar of Chongshan, Guantao; later, the labor of planning came primarily from Yang, the age-tribute scholar of Momin, Tangyi."
    This proves that Wu Xun's "undertaking" was not only based on feudal usury exploitation, but also colluded with these powerful figures of the feudal landlord class from the very beginning, receiving their full support.
    The wealthy and gentry elders, headed by Yang Shufang and others, not only helped Wu Xun to "solicit donations and prepare righteous schools in many ways," but also jointly requested the Qing court to give Wu Xun "praise and awards." Due to their recommendation, Guo Chunxu, the magistrate of Tangyi, personally visited Wu Xun, gave him ten taels of silver, and submitted a memorial to the governor's office for transmission. This governor was none other than Zhang Yao, the executioner who massacred the people of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion. According to the "Shandong Tongzhi," Zhang Yao, styled Langzhai, was a native of Daxing County, Shuntian Prefecture, originally from Shangyu, Zhejiang. In the early years of Xianfeng, he "led troops to suppress bandits" in Henan (referring to fighting against the Taiping army), "repeatedly achieved extraordinary merits," and was "promoted to be the Henan Provincial Treasurer"; in the early years of Tongzhi, he was "appointed as a general, jointly suppressing Zhang Zongyu's Nian rebels, annihilating more than 10,000 fierce bandits in the battles of Linyi and Jiyang"; later he served as "Guangdong Naval Commander" and "Governor of Guangxi with the title of Grand Secretary." After this executioner took office as Governor of Shandong, he continued to massacre the masses of the Nian Rebellion. Wu Xun, however, received his appreciation and was summoned to the governor's office in Jinan. Zhang Yao rewarded Wu Xun with two hundred taels of treasury silver and gave him a yellow silk alms book, stamped with the governor's official seal, so that Wu Xun could easily solicit donations everywhere. Subsequently, the Qing court, based on Zhang Yao's memorial, appointed Wu Xun as "Righteous School Principal," gave him a yellow jacket and a plaque of "Happy to Do Good and Giving," and allowed him to build an archway. After Wu Xun's death, another governor, Yuan Shuxun,奏请"宣付国史馆立传"and established a shrine for him.
    This is how Wu Xun climbed to the court of the feudal rulers. What an ugly history! Those who praise Wu Xun are not unaware of these facts, but why do they try to cover up and distort history in every possible way? Can such a distortion of history be tolerated? Absolutely not! We must face history squarely and mercilessly expose Wu Xun's shameless behavior of selling out the working class for personal gain.
    I say that Wu Xun sold out the laboring class for personal gain, which is by no means an exaggeration. This can be fully and forcefully refuted by the words of praise for Wu Xun from feudalists. The "Epitaph for Wu, a Benevolent Gentleman Named Xun" written by Jia Pinzhong contains the following passage:
        "If one insists on the cause of seeking glory and can achieve glory for oneself, then heaven cannot but glorify it; it is following heaven. If one broadens the path of seeking glory and can bring glory to others, then heaven cannot bear not to glorify it; it is overcoming heaven. Then one sighs that heaven's reward for good people is indeed not in vain."
    This is the reactionary class's "definitive conclusion" on Wu Xun. Do their praise of Wu Xun's "following heaven" and "seeking glory" not suffice to prove Wu Xun's unforgivable sin of betraying the laboring people and surrendering to the feudal ruling class?
    Some people say: Wu Xun was born in such a dark society, and no one led him, so he did not stand firm on the class stand and took the wrong path, which can be forgiven. Such a statement, at first glance, seems very "fair," but in fact, it is an unfounded and boring excuse.
    In the fourth year of Xianfeng under the dark rule of the Qing Dynasty, that is, in 1854 AD, when Wu Xun was sixteen years old, the army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution captured Qingzhou City, crossed the Yellow River to the north, and operated in Wu Xun's hometown of Tangyi and nearby Linqing, Gaotang, and other counties. The Taiping army even stationed in Gaotang County for half a year. Why did Wu Xun turn a deaf ear to all this? Later, the Nian Rebellion broke out and launched an armed peasant struggle throughout Shandong. Wu Xun was already in his thirties. Why did he still turn a deaf ear to it? Obviously, Wu Xun was not standing on the position of the oppressed peasant class at all. Therefore, he and the Taiping Army and the Nian Army took completely opposite paths; Wu Xun stood on the position of the feudal landlord ruling class, obeyed the landlord class, accepted the leadership of the landlord class, and tried his best to paralyze the fighting will of the peasants. Is there any way to cover this up?
    The "Popular Story of Wu Xun of Tangyi, Shandong, Begging for a Living and Establishing Schools," written by Zhang Qing and published during the Guangxu period, states that Wu Xun's motivation for establishing schools was:
    "One person who doesn't study is poor, everyone who doesn't study is poor. Looking ahead, if there are more poor people, they can do anything like stealing, swindling, and robbery. At this time, the rich will not live in peace, and the poor will not know whether to live or die."
    It is very clear that what Wu Xun was worried about was that the landlord ruling class "would not live in peace" and was afraid that the "poor people" would rebel. Therefore, he wholeheartedly and slavishly relied on the feudal rulers, cooperated with the gentry and landlords, and stood on the counter-revolutionary position, consciously and purposefully acting as a running dog used by the Qing imperial court. According to the "Tangyi County Records," "(Wu Xun) after losing his mother at a young age, entrusted the family affairs to his brother and took the establishment of schools as his responsibility." Wu Xun's school-building plan coincided with the counter-revolutionary policies of the feudal rulers, and his "penance" was the best way to deceive the backward masses. It is no wonder that the reactionary rulers, from Empress Dowager Cixi to Chiang Kai-shek, regarded him as the cheapest tool.
    It is certain that Wu Xun's "righteous school" would have been difficult to establish without relying on the ruling power of the feudal landlord class. The initial funding for Wu Xun to start the righteous school was three acres of land that he and his brother obtained from dividing the family property, which was sold for one hundred and twenty strings of cash. His own initial savings from "begging" were said to be six strings of cash by some and ninety strings by others. The total of the two items was no more than one hundred and twenty-six strings or two hundred and ten strings of cash. With this sum of money, he lent at high interest rates, exploited land rent, and did everything possible. According to the Shandong Tongzhi: "(Wu Xun) would deposit money with wealthy families and calculate interest at three percent per year. Little by little, he accumulated a huge fortune." Wu Xun himself also admitted, "Save money, earn interest, build righteous schools, no worries." "The poor use it, the rich protect it, building a righteous school is not wrong." When he had more money, he bought land. In Liulin Town alone, Wu Xun occupied 230 acres of land, collecting 368 strings of rent each year. This is enough to prove that Wu Xun was actually a member of the gentry and landlord class. He cruelly sucked the fat of the peasants to promote feudal culture for the gentry and landlord class and cultivate large and small lackeys. And all of these actions were under the command of gentry and landlords like Yang Shufang. The "Continued Literature Examination of the Qing Dynasty" states: "Wu Xun established a school... the housing and expenses were fully prepared, and people were hired to manage it, but he never intervened." Not only did he not intervene, but even when the school opened, as described in the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty": "He prepared a grand feast for the teacher, and seven screens stood outside the door. After the feast was over, he sipped the leftovers, saying: 'I am a beggar and dare not show disrespect to the teacher.'" The reason why he always maintained the appearance of begging on the surface was undoubtedly because the feudal rulers needed such a lackey leader as a model.
    In fact, the so-called "filial piety" and "penance" of Wu Xun, which were praised by all reactionary propagandists, were not only extremely reactionary in essence but also very hypocritical in form. According to Zang Kejia's article "Wu Xun's Righteous School Syndrome," "No matter who he met, regardless of whether it was three, seven, or twenty-one, he would open his mouth to ask for money. When he pushed the mill for others, he would secretly swallow the flour into his mouth when people could not see, so as to save his own meal. Unfortunately, if he was discovered, he would also smile and say: 'When you are not paying attention, the donkey also forks (scoops) flour into its mouth!' In fact, after a long time, his little problem had become public." When Wu Xun's mother died, his brother asked him to go home to keep watch over the spirit. His reply was: "It's okay to go home to keep watch over the spirit, but you have to give me one hundred coins for every cry I make." May I ask those who worship Wu Xun, is this the "filial piety" you praise? Is this "penance"? Why don't you dare to mention these facts at all? There are too many facts that those who worship Wu Xun dare not mention, such as Wu Xun acting as a matchmaker, almost monopolizing the marriages of men and women in the countryside; and making profits from land and house transactions. However, all of these are on record, who can cover them up?
    It is not surprising that the past reactionary rulers, from Empress Dowager Cixi to Chiang Kai-shek, praised Wu Xun extremely. Because Wu Xun belonged to their gang, he was a running dog used by the feudal emperors and the cheapest tool for reactionary rulers to deceive the people. Chinese bourgeois reformers, from Liang Qichao to Tao Xingzhi, may not have seen Wu Xun's feudal lackey face clearly and regarded him as a teacher of reformism. This reflects the lack of political capital of Chinese bourgeois reformers, and it is not surprising. What is most strange is that in today's ideological circles in our country, there is a complete loss of political vigilance regarding the reactionary propaganda of feudalism and the bourgeoisie; and even some people, after discovering mistakes, are still unwilling to conduct research and self-criticism honestly, but perfunctorily deal with it in a rough or insincere manner. This is really unforgivable. Therefore, continuing to unfold the criticism and discussion of "The Story of Wu Xun" remains an important task for the current ideological circles.

　　武训的真面目
    ——评《武训传》影片、武训以及孙瑜先生的检讨
    丁曼公
    影片《武训传》的编导者孙瑜先生所作《我对〈武训传〉所犯错误的初步认识》一文（见本月二十六日本报第三版）中说：“无论编导者的主观愿望如何，客观的实践却证明了《武训传》对观众起了模糊革命思想的反作用。”这个意思就是企图引起读者和观众的一种糊涂观念，以为作者的“主观愿望”是革命的，只是影片发生了“反作用”。这个道理说得通吗？
    作者的主观愿望不能离开他的创作的客观实践来说明，这是最起码的理论常识。《武训传》影片的编导者的主观愿望，已经在影片中表现出来了；影片所发生的作用，决不是与作者主观愿望相反的“反作用”，而正是作者主观愿望所必然产生的正作用。这正如武训的主观愿望，已经从他一生的历史事实中全部表现出来一样。
    在《武训传》影片的主题歌中，作者对自己的主观愿望和指导思想不是已经作了充分的说明了吗？作者除了叹息“世风何薄，大陆日沉”，表示了对中国人民的绝望和诅咒以外，对于武训并无半个可以“算是批评了他”的字句。相反的，作者在这个歌词和其他许多文字中，都不顾一切地集中了所有的革命词汇，把武训歌颂为人世间最伟大的人物。
    由于作者的这种思想支配与贯穿了全部影片，于是影片的故事结构和人物刻划，就充满了不堪容忍的污蔑人民、污蔑革命、污蔑历史的恶劣形象，通过这一切形象就给予观众以极大的毒害。
    为了达到作者的主观目的，影片编导的手法，极尽了歪曲与夸大渲染之能事。他甚至不惜捏造了周大这样的人物，硬把武训和太平天国拉扯到一起，构成“一文一武”分头进行革命的违背历史真实性的故事；并且极端歪曲地把太平军描绘成杀人放火的一群，用他们的失败来反衬武训的“成功”，来否定被压迫人民的阶级斗争，来宣扬向反动的封建统治者屈膝投降的可耻行为。影片假托一个梦境，把武训“行乞兴学”的迷梦神圣化起来，把“无自由由于无文化，有文化就是有自由”的荒谬公式艺术化起来；又用许多特写的镜头，拿“不倒翁”来代表所谓“韧性的革命战斗的性格”。而这种性格在影片中的发展，就是那一连串跪倒、磕头、爬行和承受拳打、脚踢等一切凌辱的“苦行”。作者企图将这极端反动的一切都说成是革命的，这难道还可以容忍吗？
    有人说：《武训传》影片是要不得的；但是，历史上的武训和银幕上的武训却大不一样，作为历史人物的武训，对于社会的功绩是不应该抹杀的。这种说法显然是没有根据的。《武训传》影片和武训的历史在本质上是相同的。所不同的是影片把武训装扮成了一个为武训所梦想不到的“革命者”，其流毒也就在这里。
    历史上的武训，无疑是满清统治者用来欺骗人民的工具。他在本质上是属于反动的封建阶级的人物，而决不是属于劳动人民的。他老早就投靠了封建统治阶级，而背离了劳动人民。地主李老辫对待武训是骂、打、骗，不把他当人；但其结果，不是激起武训对地主阶级的反抗，而是造成了他向地主阶级的投降。武训从那时起，就死求百赖地跪倒在地主阶级的门前，爬、爬、爬，一直爬到封建统治者的庙堂上去了。
    当时山东馆陶县塔头村有一个三品衔的武进士娄峻岭，堂邑县柳林镇又有一个进士杨树芳，这两个人都是当地当权的豪绅地主阶级的代表人物。他们比起李老辫那个地主来，势力就大得多了。武训受了地主李老辫的欺侮之后，却找到了这两个比李老辫更大的地主，跪在他们的面前，苦苦哀求，依附于他们的势力之下；并且经过他们，进一步投入了整个豪绅地主阶级和满清统治者的怀抱里去。这是武训的全部历史发展的关键，从这里才能看出武训的真面目。
    据满清光绪十四年（公历一八八八年）山东堂邑县署“为行乞兴学义民武训请旌底案”中所附陈代卿作《武七传》称：
        “武七……梦人语之曰：汝一生困苦，无大享受，能创建义学，方有
    转机。既寤，述所梦于柳林岁贡杨树芳，杨曰：义学非可赤手办，汝后有
    钱交我存，决不汝负，母听非人言，一误再误也。”
    贾品重所作“武善士训墓志铭”也说：
        “始则馆陶武进士崇山娄公生息之力居多；后则堂邑岁进士模民杨公
    筹划之劳尤巨。”
    这就证明武训的“事业”，不但是以封建高利贷剥削为基础的，而且一开始就是与这些封建地主阶级的当权派相勾结，得到他们全力支持的。
    以杨树芳等为首的富豪耆绅们，不独帮助武训，“多方劝募，筹办义学”；并且联名请求满清朝廷给武训以“旌奖”。由于他们的推荐，堂邑知县郭春煦曾亲自访问过武训，赠给十两银子，并向巡抚衙门呈请转奏。这个巡抚不是别人，正是屠杀太平天国和捻党起义人民的刽子手张曜。据“山东通志”所载，张曜号朗斋，是顺天府大兴县人，原籍浙江上虞。他于咸丰初年，在河南“带勇剿贼”（按即指与太平军作战），“屡立奇功”，曾被“擢为河南布政使”；同治初年，“官拜总兵，会剿张总愚股捻，临邑济阳之役，歼毙悍贼万余”；后任“广东陆路提督”、“广西巡抚加尚书衔”。这个刽子手就任山东巡抚之后，继续大肆屠杀捻党起义群众。武训却得到了他的赏识，被召见于济南的巡抚衙门。张曜赏了武训二百两库银，又给他一本黄绫的化缘簿，上面钤了巡抚的官印，使武训可以毫无困难地到处募捐。随后满清朝廷根据张曜的奏折，封武训为“义学正”，赐给黄马褂和“乐善好施”的匾额，准予建立牌坊。武训死后，又由另一个巡抚袁树勋奏准“宣付国史馆立传”，并为他立祠祭祀。
    武训就是这样爬上了封建统治者的庙堂，这是多么丑恶的历史呀！歌颂武训的人们，并非不知道这些事实，却为什么要百般遮盖，歪曲历史呢？这样的歪曲历史是可以容忍的吗？绝对不能！我们一定要正视历史，无情地揭露武训出卖劳动阶级以求荣的无耻行为。
    我说武训出卖劳动阶级以求荣，这决不是过火的。这从封建主义者赞颂武训的文词中，完全可以得到有力的反证。贾品重所撰《武善士训墓志铭》中有这样的一段：   “夫坚持乎求荣之业，而能致己于荣者，天所不得不荣之也，顺天者也。广阔乎求荣之途，而能致人于荣者，天又不忍不荣之也，胜天者也。然后叹天之报施善人，果不爽也。”
    这是反动阶级对于武训的“盖棺论定”。他们称赞武训的“顺天”“求荣”，难道不足以证明武训出卖劳动人民，投降封建统治阶级的不可宽恕的罪恶吗？
    有人说：武训生在那样黑暗的社会，没有人领导他，因此没有站稳阶级立场，走错了路，是可以原谅的。这样的说法，乍听起来，似乎很“公道”，其实是不合事实的无聊的辩解。
    在满清黑暗统治下的咸丰四年，即公历一八五四年，武训十六岁的时候，太平天国农民革命的军队攻克了青州城，北渡黄河，在武训的家乡堂邑及附近的临清、高唐等县活动，太平军并驻守高唐县城达半年之久，武训为什么都置之不闻不问呢？以后捻军起义，又在整个山东掀起了农民武装斗争，武训已三十几岁了，为什么他还是置之不闻不问呢？很显然的，武训根本不是站在被压迫的农民阶级的立场上，因此，他和太平军、捻军走的是完全相反的路；武训是站到封建地主统治阶级的立场上去，听命于地主阶级，接受地主阶级的领导，极力麻痹农民的斗争意志，这还有什么办法可以掩饰呢？
    光绪年间出版的张清所作的《山东堂邑乞人武训兴学俗话传》叙明武训兴学的动机是：
    “一人不学一人穷，人人不学人人穷，往后来看，穷人多了，什么做贼、诓骗、劫夺都能做出来了。到了这时候，有钱的过着也不安稳，穷的也不知死活了。”
    清楚得很，武训所忧虑的就是地主统治阶级“过得不安稳”，害怕“穷人”造反。因此他死心塌地奴颜婢膝地投靠于封建统治者，与豪绅地主合作，站在反革命的立场上，有意识、有计划地充当了满清皇家御用的走卒。据《堂邑县志》载称：“（武训）自弱冠失恃后，即委家事于其兄，而以兴学为己任。”武训的兴学计划与封建统治者的反革命政策恰相符合，同时他的“苦行”又是欺骗落后群众的最好形式。这就无怪乎从西太后到蒋介石，一脉相承的反动统治者都把他当作最廉价的工具了。
    如果不是依靠了封建地主阶级的统治势力，武训的“义学”决难举办是可以肯定的。武训最初筹办义学的经费是他和他的哥哥分家所得的三亩地，变卖了一百二十吊钱。他自己最初“行乞”的积蓄，有的说是六吊钱，有的说是九十吊。两项合计不过一百二十六吊或二百一十吊钱。他用这一笔资金，高利放贷，剥削地租，无所不为。据山东通志载：“（武训）得钱辄寄诸富家，岁以三分计息，铢积寸累，遂至巨万。”武训自己也承认“存本钱，生利钱，兴义学，没心烦。”“穷的使，富的保，修个义学错不了。”他的钱多了，就买田地。仅在柳林镇一处，武训竟占有了二百三十亩地，每年收租达三百六十八吊。这已足以证明武训实际上是豪绅地主阶级的一分子，他残酷地吮吸着农民的脂膏，来为豪绅地主阶级宣扬封建文化，培养大小奴才。而这一切作为，武训是一律听从豪绅地主杨树芳之流的指挥的。“清朝续文献通考”称：“武训设学……宅舍经费惟备，倩人董理，己绝不过问。”不但不过问，他甚至在开学的时候，如《清史稿》所述：“具盛馔飨师，七屏立门外，俟讌罢，啜其余，曰：我乞者，不敢与师抗礼也。”他之所以一直在表面上保持要饭的样子，无疑地是因为封建统治者需要这么一个奴才头子作模楷的原故。
    实际上一切反动宣传家所称道的武训之所谓“孝义”和“苦行”，不但在本质上是极端反动的，而且在形式上也是非常虚伪的。据臧克家作《武训先生的义学症》一文中说他“不管见了谁，不管三七二十一，开口就要钱。他为人推磨，人家看不见时，偷向口里掩（吞）面，这样可以省了吃自己的饭。不幸被人家发觉，他也会陪笑的说：不提防时驴还叉（用口猛掠）口面呢！其实日子久了，他的这个小毛病早成公开的了。”当武训的母亲死了的时候，他的哥哥叫他回家守灵，他的回答是：“回家守灵可以，我哭一声，你得给我一百钱。”请问崇拜武训的人们，这就是你们所称道的“孝义”吗？这就是“苦行”吗？为什么你们对这些事实一点也不敢提呢？崇拜武训者不敢提起的事实太多了，诸如武训做媒，几乎包办了乡间男女的婚姻；做田房交易，从中取利。但是，这些无一不是有案可查的，谁能够掩盖得了呢？
    过去的反动统治者，从西太后到蒋介石，对于武训备极赞扬是毫不足怪的。因为武训是属于他们一伙的，是封建帝王的御用走卒，是反动统治者最能欺骗人民而又最廉价的工具。中国资产阶级改良主义者，从梁启超到陶行知，也许看不清武训这个封建主义的奴才面目，把他当成改良主义的老师，这是反映了中国资产阶级改良主义者政治资本贫乏的状况，也还不算什么奇怪。最可怪的是在今天我国的思想界，对于封建主义和资产阶级的反动宣传，竟然完全丧失了政治警觉性；甚至还有一些人，在发现了错误之后，仍然不肯老老实实地进行研究与检讨，而以粗枝大叶或口是心非的态度来敷衍搪塞，这实在是不可原谅的。因此，继续展开对于《武训传》的批判与讨论，仍然是目前思想界的重要任务。
