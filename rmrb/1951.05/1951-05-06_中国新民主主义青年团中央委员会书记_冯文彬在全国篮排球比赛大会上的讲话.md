　　Comrades,

　　Speech by Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, at the National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament

　　The National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament opens today. First, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation, to extend our respects to you! This conference is of great significance for promoting the development of sports throughout the country, and will further promote sports activities extensively throughout the country. Taking this opportunity, I would like to make a few requests to everyone:

　　First, sports should become a regular and continuously developing movement. After this conference, all regions are required to consolidate and develop the enthusiasm for participating in this competition, and to combine sports with production, study, and combat, making it an indispensable activity in the daily life of every young person, so that every young person has a healthy body and is ready to serve the motherland at any time.

　　Second, sports should become a popular movement. All regions must first advocate and develop various basic sports activities, such as track and field, gymnastics, and other sports related to national defense construction.

　　Third, all aspects of sports should continuously improve and progress from the current level. Intensify training and gradually strive for world records.

　　Fourth, sports should gradually become a movement that is systematic, organized, and led. Prepare to start a trial implementation of a sports grading system, first establish grassroots sports organizations in factories, schools, and government offices, and establish the All-China Sports Federation, gradually making sports a planned and led movement.

　　Comrades, friends! Intensify physical exercise, prepare to serve the motherland at any time, strive to win and create new records, and advance under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong!

　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记
    冯文彬在全国篮排球比赛大会上的讲话
    全国篮排球比赛大会今天开幕了。首先请允许我代表中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国体育总会筹备委员会向你们致敬！这次大会，对于推动全国体育运动的发展，有很重大的意义，并将更进一步在全国范围内广泛地开展体育运动。趁这机会，我向大家提出几点要求：
    第一、体育运动应当成为经常的、不断发展的运动，要求各地从这次大会后，把这次参加比赛的热情巩固起来、发展起来，把体育运动同生产、学习、战斗结合起来，成为每个青年日常生活不可缺少的活动，使每个青年都具有健康的身体，随时准备为祖国服务。
    第二、体育运动应当成为普及的运动，要求各地首先必须提倡和发展各种基本的体育活动，如田径、体操等与国防建设有关的运动。
    第三、体育运动的各方面，应当从现有水平上，都获得不断的提高和改进。加紧锻炼，逐步地为争取世界纪录而奋斗。
    第四、体育运动应当逐渐做到是：有制度、有组织、有领导的运动。准备开始试行体育等级制度，首先在工厂、学校、机关中间建立体育的基层组织，成立全国体育总会，逐渐使体育运动成为有计划有领导的运动。
    同志们，朋友们！加紧锻炼身体，准备随时为祖国服务，努力争取和创造新的纪录，在毛泽东胜利的旗帜下前进！
