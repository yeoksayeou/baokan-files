Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: Despite the suppression and sabotage by the American and Japanese reactionaries, the working people of major Japanese cities still gathered to celebrate May Day.

　　The unified rally in Tokyo, originally scheduled to be held in "People's Square" (i.e., the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace) to celebrate May Day, was banned by the American occupation authorities and the Yoshida government. However, according to the Dentsu News Agency, 50,000 Japanese workers and Korean residents affiliated with progressive labor unions responded to the call from the Japanese Communist Party to hold separate rallies on the 1st in four locations in Tokyo. The Yoshida government mobilized nearly all of Tokyo's 20,000 police officers to implement "security," but the rallies in each location proceeded with fervent enthusiasm. The speeches, slogans, and placards at each rally demanded the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and opposed the rearmament of Japan, and strongly condemned Japan being used as a military base for the war of aggression in Korea. The placards at the rallies also displayed the following slogans: "Oppose War," "Defend Peace," "Down with the Yoshida Reactionary Government," "No More Hiroshima Incidents."

　　In other cities, labor unions held meetings or parades to celebrate May Day. In Osaka, 100,000 workers held a rally. In Kawasaki, 27,000 workers participated in a demonstration. In Kyoto, Prefectural Governor Torazo Ninagawa and City Mayor Gizo Takayama (note that both were elected last year through the democratic united front) personally led 30,000 workers in a parade.

　　Demonstrations in Kobe, Shizuoka, and other places were met with brutal suppression by the police. In Kobe, police arrested eleven people for distributing anti-war slogans. In Shizuoka, seven labor union activists were arrested.

　　不顾美日反动派的镇压
    日本人民纷纷集会
    庆祝五一节反对重新武装
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：不顾美、日反动派的镇压与破坏，日本各大城市的劳动人民仍然纷纷集会庆祝“五一”劳动节。
    东京人民原订在“人民广场”（即皇宫前广场）举行的庆祝“五一”节的统一的大会，遭到美国占领当局和吉田政府的禁止。但据电通社称，五万名属于进步工会的日本工人及朝鲜侨民，响应日本共产党所发出的分别举行大会的号召，于一日在东京的四个地方召开大会。吉田政府出动了几乎东京的全部警察二万名，实行“戒备”，但各处大会仍在热烈的情绪中进行。各个大会的演说和口号以及标语牌，都要求缔结全面和约与反对重新武装日本，并强烈指责日本正被用作侵朝战争的军事基地。大会的标语牌并写着下列口号：“反对战争”，“保卫和平”，“打倒吉田反动政府”，“不要再发生广岛事件”。
    在其他城市，各工会纷纷开会或举行游行庆祝“五一”节。在大阪，有十万名工人召开大会。在川崎，有两万七千名工人参加游行示威。在京都，京都府府知事蜷川虎三和京都市市长高山义三（按两人系于去年经民主统一战线推选而当选的），亲自率领三万名工人游行。
    神户、静冈等地的游行示威，曾遭到警察横暴的镇压。在神户，警察逮捕了十一个散发反战标语的人。在静冈，有七名工会运动者被捕。
