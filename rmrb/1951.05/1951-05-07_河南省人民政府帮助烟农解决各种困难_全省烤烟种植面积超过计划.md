　　Henan Provincial People's Government Helps Tobacco Farmers Solve Various Difficulties
    Planting Area of Flue-Cured Tobacco Exceeds Plan
    The planting area of flue-cured tobacco in Henan Province this year has exceeded the original plan. The provincial agricultural and forestry production conference originally planned to plant 833,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco. According to preliminary statistics, the planting area in the province has reached 1,140,000 mu. Currently, most tobacco fields have been sown, and some tobacco seedlings have already emerged.

    Henan Province is a well-known flue-cured tobacco producing area in the country. This year, the Central People's Government announced the tobacco leaf purchase and pre-purchase methods and stipulated the tobacco-grain price ratio, dispelling the ideological concerns of tobacco farmers. The Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry specifically helped tobacco farmers solve difficulties in seeds, fertilizers, coal for curing tobacco, and tobacco curing barns, thus boosting the production enthusiasm of tobacco farmers.

    After February this year, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry distributed a total of 2,980 jin of tobacco seeds originally stored and allocated to the province by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to tobacco farmers for use, solving the difficulty of seed shortage. It also mobilized tobacco farmers to collectively cultivate seedlings and adopt false planting methods to achieve timely sowing and planting. Sesame cake is better for tobacco planting fertilizer. In addition to lending more than 11.5 million jin of sesame cake already purchased to tobacco farmers, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also guided tobacco farmers to use bean cake, cottonseed cake, and issue loans so that tobacco farmers can solve the fertilizer problem themselves. Regarding coal for curing tobacco, in addition to a portion that tobacco farmers in various places have already solved themselves, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has allocated 75,000 tons to the Xuchang area, and most of it has now been distributed to tobacco farmers. Tobacco curing barns have suffered considerable losses due to the destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. According to surveys, there are still 622 tobacco curing barns available for use, but 300 of them still need to be repaired. According to actual needs, 11,493 new ones need to be built to meet the needs. This problem has also been resolved after government loans helped.

### 河南省人民政府帮助烟农解决各种困难  全省烤烟种植面积超过计划

　　河南省人民政府帮助烟农解决各种困难
    全省烤烟种植面积超过计划
    河南省今年烤烟播种面积已超过原计划。该省农林生产会议原布置种植烤烟八十三万三千亩，现据初步统计，全省种植面积已达一百一十四万亩。目前烟田多已播种，有的烟苗已经出土。
    河南省是全国著名的烤烟产区，今年中央人民政府公布了烟叶收购、预购办法，并规定了烟粮比价，解除了烟农的思想顾虑。河南省农林厅并具体帮助烟农解决了种籽、肥料、烤烟用煤和烤烟房等困难，因而烟农生产情绪普遍高涨。
    今年二月以后，该省农林厅即将原存烟种和中央人民政府贸易部拨给该省的烟种共二千九百八十斤，先后分发给烟农使用，解决了烟种缺乏的困难，并发动烟农集体育苗和采用假植办法，以便作到适时播种和栽植。种烟用肥料以芝麻饼较好。省农林厅除将已买得的一千一百五十余万斤芝麻饼，贷放给烟农外，并指导烟农使用豆饼、棉饼，和发放贷款使烟农能够自行解决肥料问题。烤烟用煤，除各地烟农已自行解决了一部分外，中央人民政府贸易部已调拨许昌专区七万五千吨，现大部已分发到烟农手中。烤烟房因受过去国民党反动派的摧残，损失颇大。据调查，现尚有六百二十二座烤烟房可资运用，但其中三百座尚需加以修理，按照实际需要，还需新建一万一千四百九十三座方够使用。这个问题经过政府贷款帮助后也已得到解决。
