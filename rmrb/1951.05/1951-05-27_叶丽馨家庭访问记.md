A Visit to Ye Lixing's Family
Southern Daily Reporter

On the liberated soil of our great motherland, new things are constantly emerging everywhere and at every moment. The transformation of the Ye Lixing family of four from quarreling to happiness and harmony is one of the countless new things constantly emerging in the new society.

Ye Lixing's family is hardworking and happy. They live in two small rooms on the rooftop of a three-story building on Huiai Road. Although not spacious, they are clean and comfortable. A color portrait of Chairman Mao and several large red flowers that Ye Lixing wore when she was elected a model worker at the military rubber factory last year show the love of the people living in these two rooms for the motherland and labor. Ye Lixing and her younger sister-in-law, Fan Zhongping, go to work at the military rubber factory before 6:30 every morning and are never a minute late. Then, her husband, Fan Yongtian, goes out on his tricycle at 7 o'clock to find business. The youngest sister-in-law, Fan Aiping, stays at home to take care of housework. In the evening, the whole family attends night school, and sometimes they have meetings. They review their lessons after returning home, until after 11 o'clock or even 12 o'clock.

Ye Lixing is a woman worker with a forthright personality. She is quick in her work, speaks her mind, and always keeps in mind how to do her job well and how to help others improve. She said, "In the past, my lover did not make progress, and he missed seven out of ten meetings. I was always worried about the two younger sisters-in-law, and there was no mother-in-law to take care of the family. Now everyone is making progress. I can go wherever the work needs me, and I will do whatever I am asked to do."

Ye Lixing's family has not always been so harmonious and progressive. Before Guangzhou was liberated, the couple struggled from morning to night, unable to afford both breakfast and dinner. The oppression of the cruel reality of life caused frequent quarrels in this small family. Although life has become more and more stable since liberation, they sometimes spent all their wages in a few days because there was no plan or rules. In addition, both of them were very subjective and often bickered over trivial matters. Although Fan Yongtian was honest and kind, he was not interested in collective activities and did not actively seek progress. Ye Lixing had no way to change him and could only worry herself.

Since the nationwide launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement this spring, Ye Lixing's factory and Fan Yongtian's trade union have carried out patriotic education, made current affairs reports, and held discussion and accusation meetings. Like a spring thunder, it awakened Ye Lixing and Fan Yongtian's small family. The four of them held a family meeting, conducted self-criticism, formulated a family plan and a patriotic pact, and also formulated individual patriotic pacts aimed at their own shortcomings. They also established inspection and meeting systems. Since then, not only have the daily disputes in the family been greatly reduced, but also everyone has made significant progress under mutual criticism and supervision. Fan Yongtian's progress was the fastest, which was a powerful encouragement for the whole family.

Ye Lixing frankly and happily described the situation of their family's mutual criticism and supervision. She said that once she was criticized by her comrades and went home and complained, "They criticized me, and I will criticize them in the future." But Fan Yongtian immediately pointed out that her attitude was wrong and she should not retaliate. Fan Yongtian and Ye Lixing also helped their two younger sisters learn. Fan Zhongping, who was illiterate before, is now very active in production and can write a diary under the education of the Youth League and the trade union and with the help of her brother and sister-in-law. Fan Aiping also studied hard and no longer "pouted" often.

However, Ye Lixing's family is not satisfied with the existing achievements. Under the education and influence of the Party, the liberated working people have admirable ambitions and a broad vision. Seeing that the tricycle business was slowing down, Fan Yongtian prepared to "learn to drive a tractor." Fan Yongtian's eyes sparkled with confidence, and he said, "This is for developing production."

Ye Lixing is preparing to revise her family plan. She said excitedly that the Party's birthday, "July 1st," is coming soon. She wants to hold another family meeting recently and add a few more items to the plan to welcome "July 1st." So she carefully counted and said: First, we must step up production and step up learning; second, we must publicize Resist America, Aid Korea at any time. If people don’t understand, we will explain it to them. If we don’t understand, we will ask the trade union; third, we must do a good job in the newspaper reading group. Because she and Fan Yongtian have recently joined the newspaper reading group.

"Why are you so concerned about 'July 1st'?" Ye Lixing said excitedly: "The Communist Party has been working for our people for the past thirty years, and that's why we have today. The 25,000-li Long March, Chairman Mao risking danger to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, Comrade Peng Pai fighting to the death for the revolution, aren't they all for us?" Ye Lixing's eyes turned red, she wiped her tears, paused for a while and said: "We must implement the patriotic pact and do our job well. We must also expose bad people. I must also overcome difficulties in order to be worthy of the martyrs and worthy of Chairman Mao."

　　叶丽馨家庭访问记
    南方日报记者
    在我们伟大的祖国解放了的土地上，每一时，每一处，新鲜的事物不断出现。女工叶丽馨的四口之家由吵吵闹闹变成幸福和睦，就是在新社会里不断涌现的无数新鲜事物中间的一件。
    叶丽馨的一家是勤劳的，也是快乐的。他们住在惠爱路一座三层楼的天台上的两间小房里，虽然不算宽敞，倒也干净安适。一幅毛主席的彩色画像和几朵叶丽馨去年在军胶厂当选为劳动模范时佩戴过的大红花，表明了住在这两间房里的人们对祖国和劳动的热爱。叶丽馨每天早上六点半钟以前就和小姑范仲平一起到军胶厂上工，从来不肯迟到一分钟。然后，她的丈夫范永添在七点钟踏着三轮车出去找生意。最小的小姑范爱平则留在家里料理家务。晚上，他们全家都上夜校读书，有时候还要开会。回家来再温习功课，到十一点多，以至十二点钟。
    叶丽馨是一个性格朗爽的女工。她做事快当，有话就说，心里时时都记挂着如何做好工作和如何帮助别人进步。她说：“以前我爱人不进步，十次开会，他七次不到。两个小姑，家里又没有婆婆照顾，我总不放心。现在个个都进步，真是工作要我到那里我就到那里，要我怎么做我就怎么做。”
    叶丽馨的家庭，并不是向来就这样和睦和进步的。在广州解放以前，两夫妻从早捱到晚，还是顾得早饭顾不得晚饭。由于残酷的现实生活的压迫，使这个小家庭内经常发生吵嘴的事情。解放后虽然生活是一天天安定起来了，但是因为没有计划，没有规章，有时还是领到工钱不多几天就花光了。加上两个人主观都很强，时常为了一点小事就斗嘴。范永添虽然为人忠厚，但是对集体活动不感兴趣，不积极要求进步。叶丽馨也没有办法改变他，只有自己发愁。
    自从今年春天，抗美援朝爱国运动普遍展开，叶丽馨的工厂和范永添的工会都进行了爱国主义的教育，作了时事报告，举行了座谈会、控诉会。像一阵春雷，把叶丽馨和范永添的小家庭震醒了。他们四个人开了一次家庭会议，进行了检讨，订立了家庭计划和爱国公约，又针对各人自己的缺点订立了个人爱国公约，还建立了检查和会议制度。从此，不但大大减少了家里的日常纠纷，而且每个人在互相批评和督促下，都获得了显著的进步。范永添进步最快，对于全家都是一个有力的鼓舞。
    叶丽馨坦白而欢喜地讲述他们一家互相批评督促的情形。她说，有一次她被同志们批评，回家就发牢骚说：“她们批评我，将来我亦要批评她们。”但是范永添马上就指出她的态度不对，不应该报复。范永添和叶丽馨还帮助两个妹妹学习。以前一字不识的范仲平，在青年团、工会的教育和哥哥嫂嫂的帮助下，生产很积极，也能写日记了。范爱平也用心学习，不再常常“鼓气”了。
    但是叶丽馨一家并不以已有的成绩为满足。在党的教育影响下面，翻了身的劳动人民有着可佩的抱负和远大的眼光。范永添看着三轮车的生意淡下去了，准备“学驾驶拖拉机。”范永添眼睛里闪亮着信心，他说“这是发展生产的。”
    叶丽馨又在准备修订她的家庭计划了。她兴奋地说，党的生日“七、一”快要到了。她想最近再开一次家庭会议，在计划上加上几条来迎接“七、一”。于是她用心的数着说：第一要加紧生产，加紧学习；第二要随时宣传抗美援朝，人家不懂就说给他听，自己不懂就问工会；第三要搞好读报小组。因为她自己和范永添最近都参加了读报小组。
    “为什么你这样关心‘七、一’呢？”叶丽馨激动地说：“共产党三十年来都是为着我们人民，我们才有了今日。二万五千里长征，毛主席冒着危险到重庆和蒋光头协商，彭湃同志为革命打生打死，不都是为了我们么？”叶丽馨的眼睛红了，她擦了擦眼泪，停了一会说：“我们一定要执行爱国公约，做好工作。还要检举坏人，我还一定要克服困难，才对得住先烈，对得住毛主席。”
