　　Demanding Peaceful Resolution of International Disputes
    American People Oppose the War of Aggression Against Korea
    American Labor Party Organizes Broad Peace Petition Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 5th] More and more Americans are opposing the Truman government's war policy. According to a TASS dispatch from New York: The United Packinghouse Workers of America, the Fur and Leather Workers Union, and the Teachers Union have recently held conventions demanding a peaceful resolution of international disputes. A peace rally in New York, attended by nine thousand members of the Fur and Leather Workers Union, unanimously passed a resolution demanding the immediate convocation of a Five-Power Conference to peacefully eliminate all differences and conflicts, end the Korean War, halt the remilitarization of Germany and Japan, achieve international disarmament, and eliminate the danger of a new world war.
    The National Labor Conference for Peace announced that the results of voting among workers in steel factories, meatpacking plants, construction sites, and cities along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts showed that the vast majority of workers demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Korea.
    In Gary, Indiana, the largest local branch of the United Steelworkers of America passed a resolution demanding that the Truman government resolve the Korean conflict by peaceful means.
    In several cities, residents have formed "Peace Clubs" or "Bring Our Boys Back from Korea" clubs.
    In newspapers across the United States, an increasing number of readers are writing letters demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Korea. Many parents whose sons have been killed in action in Korea or are still fighting there believe in their letters to newspapers that the adventure in Korea is a lamentable mistake by the American government.
    The American Labor Party is organizing a broad peace petition campaign. According to an announcement by the party's chairman, Marcantonio, the party will distribute peace petitions in New York and collect signatures, using this method to conduct a vote. The peace vote will be conducted in every residential area of New York State until July 4th. Signature collectors will visit five hundred thousand New York citizens. On May 12th and 19th, they will collect signatures on the streets of New York. The party has distributed five hundred thousand leaflets calling for American youth to be sent home.

    【新华社五日讯】越来越多的美国人民反对杜鲁门政府的战争政策。据塔斯社纽约消息：美国联合屠宰工人工会、毛皮工人工会和教师联合会新近都举行了大会，要求和平解决国际争端。在纽约举行的有九千毛皮工人工会会员参加的和平集会一致通过决议，要求立即召开五大国会议，以和平方式消除一切分歧与冲突，结束朝鲜战争，中止德国与日本的重新军国主义化，实现国际裁军，消除新的世界大战的危险。
    美国全国劳工和平会议委员会宣布，在钢铁工厂、肉类包装厂、建筑现场以及太平洋和大西洋沿岸各城市的工人中间进行投票的结果，绝大多数工人都要求美国军队撤出朝鲜。
    在印第安纳州的格利城，钢铁工人工会的最大的地方分会通过决议，要求杜鲁门政府以和平方法解决朝鲜冲突。
    在若干城市中，居民们成立了“和平俱乐部”或“把我们的孩子从朝鲜送回来”俱乐部。
    在美国各地的报纸上，愈来愈多的读者投书要求立即自朝鲜撤退美军。许多有儿子在朝鲜阵亡或还在朝鲜作战的父母们，在他们寄给报纸的信中，认为在朝鲜的冒险乃是美国政府可悲的错误。
    美国劳工党正在组织一个广泛的和平签名运动。据该党主席马肯托尼奥宣布，该党将在纽约散发和平请愿书，并且征集签名，用这个方法进行投票。和平投票将在纽约州每一个居民点进行，直到七月四日为止。征集签名者将访问五十万纽约市民。在五月十二日与十九日，他们将在纽约街头征集签名。该党已散发五十万份传单，要求把美国青年送回国来。
