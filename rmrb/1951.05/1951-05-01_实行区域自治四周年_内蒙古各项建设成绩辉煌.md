Four Years of Regional Autonomy
Inner Mongolia Achieves Brilliant Success in Various Constructions

May 1st this year marks the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government. The brilliant construction achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over the past four years demonstrate the unlimited development prospects of the Mongolian people implementing regional autonomy.

Over the past four years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the region's People's Government, the people of Inner Mongolia have established people's armed forces and people's governments at all levels, and actively participated in the patriotic movements of the People's Liberation War and Resistance to America and Aid Korea. The People's Government completed land reform in agricultural areas and abolished feudal privileges in pastoral areas. In the region's government, military, party affairs, economic and other departments, more than 10,000 Mongolian cadres have been trained, and they have become the backbone of various tasks in Inner Mongolia.

People's Governments at all levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have universally convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, and some areas have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress on their behalf. Currently, among the six leagues in the region, Xilin Gol, Chahar, and Hulun have held one to two sessions of people's representative conferences from all walks of life. All thirty-two banners, seven counties, three cities, and all agricultural and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral Nutuks (districts) in the region have convened two to four sessions of people's representative conferences from all walks of life. In addition, 2,184 Gacha (villages) held people's congresses and elected village people's government committees. This has greatly strengthened the ties between the People's Government and people from all walks of life.

The people of Inner Mongolia have established a strong Mongolian people's armed force in the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries and the public enemy of the Inner Mongolian people, which has become a component of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the three years prior to May 1st last year, this armed force fought against the enemy a total of 654 times, annihilating 21,900 bandits. It protected the production of the Mongolian people and stabilized social order. Now, they are enthusiastically engaged in production movements and cultural learning.

Eighty percent of the population of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is engaged in agricultural production. After land reform in the area, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has been unprecedentedly heightened. As a result, great achievements have been made in expanding cultivated land area, increasing yields, and improving cultivation techniques. According to statistics from 1948 to 1950, farmers in the region reclaimed a total of more than 3,255,000 mu of wasteland, an increase of more than 25 percent over the original cultivated land area. The area of land fertilized by farmers is expanding year by year, and new agricultural tools are being promoted and adopted. In the past year alone, farmers in the region used more than 2,400 various types of shoveling and plowing machines. The People's Government has also paid great attention to the construction of water conservancy projects. Therefore, the grain output in agricultural areas has greatly increased. For example, in Hulunbuir League, the average grain yield per mu was 120 jin in 1948, which increased to 160 jin in 1949, and maintained the level of the previous year despite the drought last year.

The Autonomous Region People's Government adopts the policy of "prosperity for both people and livestock" for animal husbandry, actively protecting and rewarding livestock breeding. At present, the total number of livestock in the six leagues of the region has increased by more than 10 percent compared to 1949, and by 14 percent compared to 1948. In 1949, preventive inoculation against cattle plague accounted for more than 48 percent of the total number of cattle in the region, which increased to 70 percent in 1950. The People's Government has established livestock epidemic prevention stations in various leagues, and has treated more than 53,000 sick animals in the two years of 1949 and 1950.

The forest area of the autonomous region accounts for one-sixth of the country's forest area. In 1949, the People's Government harvested 320,000 cubic meters of timber, and in 1950, it planned to harvest 400,000 cubic meters, exceeding the task by more than 43 percent. This year, the People's Government stipulates that forest protection should be the main focus, and advocates rational logging.

In order to promote the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production in the autonomous region and facilitate farmers and herdsmen to sell local products and purchase daily necessities and means of production, the Autonomous Region People's Government established 904 cooperatives throughout the region, with more than 646,000 members, accounting for more than 28 percent of the total population of the region.

Due to the improvement of economic life, the people's culture, education, and health undertakings have also developed. At present, there are ten middle schools in the region, with more than 3,600 students. Last year, 80 percent of primary school graduates in the region entered middle school. There are more than 3,200 primary schools in the region, with a total of more than 262,000 students. According to statistics from the four eastern leagues (Xing'an, Jirem, Hulunbuir, and Ju Ud), the number of children enrolled in school has reached more than 61 percent of all school-age children. In the past four years, the region has published more than 200 kinds of textbooks and general reading materials in Mongolian, with more than 1.3 million copies. Many rural areas also have Xinhua Bookstore sales outlets, libraries, and cultural stations. Last October, Ulanhot City established a People's Broadcasting Station. The People's Government has also made many achievements in health and epidemic prevention work, overcoming the threat of plague to the people.

　　实行区域自治四周年
    内蒙古各项建设成绩辉煌
    今年五月一日是内蒙自治区人民政府成立的四周年纪念日。内蒙自治区四年来的辉煌建设成就，显示了实行区域自治的蒙族人民无限发展的前途。
    四年以来内蒙自治区人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和该区人民政府领导下，建立了人民军队和各级人民政权，积极参加了人民解放战争、抗美援朝的爱国主义运动。人民政府在农业区完成了土地改革，牧畜区废除了封建特权。在全区政权、军队、党务、经济等部门中，培养了万余蒙族干部，他们都成为开展内蒙地区各项工作的骨干。
    内蒙自治区各级人民政府普遍地召开了各界人民代表会议，部分地区并代行人民代表大会的职权。现全区六个盟中已有锡林郭勒、察哈尔和呼纳三个盟举行了一次至两次的各界人民代表会议。全区三十二个旗、七个县、三个市和全部农业区、半农半牧区的努图克（区）均召开了两次至四次各界人民代表会议。此外，还有两千一百八十四个嘎查（村）举行了人民代表大会，选出了村人民政府委员会。这样，就大大地密切了人民政府与各界人民的联系。
    内蒙自治区的人民，在反对国民党反动派及内蒙人民公敌中，已建立起一支强大的蒙族人民武装，它成为中国人民解放军的组成部分。这支武装在去年五月一日以前的三年中，共计与敌作战六百五十四次，歼匪两万一千九百人。保卫了蒙族人民的生产，安定了社会秩序。现在，他们正热烈地进行生产运动和文化学习。
    内蒙自治区有百分之八十的人口从事农业生产。该区经过土地改革后，农民生产积极性空前提高。因之无论在扩大耕地面积、提高产量及改进耕作技术等方面，都有很大成绩。据一九四八年至一九五零年三年统计：该区农民共开荒三百二十五万五千余亩，较原有耕地面积增加百分之二十五强。农民对土地的施肥面积逐年在扩大，新式农具也正在推广采用，仅去年一年内，该区农民即使用了两千四百余台各式铲趟机。人民政府并大力注意了兴修水利的工作。因此，就使农业区的粮食产量大大增加。如呼纳盟在一九四八年每亩地平均产粮一百二十斤，至一九四九年即增至一百六十斤，去年虽遭旱灾，但仍保持了前年的水平。
    自治区人民政府对牧畜业采取“人畜两旺”的方针，积极保护与奖励繁殖牲畜。现该区六个盟的牲畜总数较一九四九年增加了百分之十强，较一九四八年增加百分之十四。一九四九年全区牛瘟预防注射占总牛数的百分之四十八强，一九五零年即增至百分之七十。人民政府在各盟都设立了家畜防疫所，在一九四九年和一九五零年两年中，共治好病畜五万三千余头。
    自治区的森林面积占全国森林面积的六分之一。一九四九年人民政府采伐木材三十二万立方米，一九五零年计划采伐四十万立方米，结果超过任务百分之四十三强。今年人民政府规定以护林为主，提倡合理采伐。
    自治区人民政府为促进该区农、牧业生产的发展，便利农、牧民推销土产品和购买生活及生产必需品，全区各地共建立了九百零四个合作社，社员达六十四万六千余人，占全区总人口的百分之二十八强。
    由于经济生活改善，人民文化、教育、卫生事业亦随着发展起来。现全区共有十处中学，拥有学生三千六百多名，去年该区百分之八十的高小毕业生升入中学。全区有三千二百多处小学，计有学生二十六万二千多名。据东部四个盟（兴安、哲里木、呼纳、昭乌达）统计：入学儿童已达全部学龄儿童的百分之六十一强。四年来该区用蒙文出版的各种教科书及一般读物共二百余种，一百三十余万册。许多农村中还设有新华书店代销处、图书馆及文化站。去年十月乌兰浩特市并建立了人民广播电台。人民政府在卫生防疫工作上也作出许多成绩，战胜了鼠疫对人民的威胁。
