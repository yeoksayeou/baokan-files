Taiyuan City Holds Representative Meeting on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
Deploys Further Development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
Calls on People from All Walks of Life to Combine Daily Work to Make the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Regular and Systematic
The Taiyuan City Representative Meeting on Resisting America and Aiding Korea was held on April 24th. More than 1,400 representatives attended the meeting. The meeting discussed and deployed how to continue to deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement after the May 1st demonstration.

The general spirit of the meeting was to require people from all walks of life in Taiyuan City to persistently and deeply carry out the patriotic movement by closely combining it with daily work and life after holding the "May 1st" demonstration.

The resolution passed by the meeting pointed out to people from all walks of life: All industrial and mining enterprises in the city must persistently carry out this movement, and must implement the Resist America, Aid Korea movement into the daily activities and daily work of production workshops, spare-time schools, and workers' family areas, and make it regular and systematic. Workers should further deepen the patriotic production competition and create exemplary teams, workshops, and factories. In the suburbs, through the propaganda activities of farmers' year-round schools, reading groups, and villages, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement should be combined with the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and banning the Yiguandao, and on the basis of continuing to raise the awareness of farmers, carry out the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement and complete the task of achieving the pre-war level of agricultural production this year. In all educational institutions and schools, it is required to infuse patriotic education into politics, Chinese language, history and geography courses, and other educational activities. The industrial and commercial sectors should consolidate the political study system, fully combine the patriotic movement with doing business, take strengthening material exchange and paying taxes on time as practical actions of patriotism, and ensure no speculation, no profiteering, no tax evasion, and no deception. Religious circles, especially Catholics, should combine the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with the religious reform movement, mobilize all believers to separate from imperialism ideologically, and achieve complete autonomy, self-propagation, and self-support. People from other industries should also establish a regular system of current affairs learning, closely combine the Resist America, Aid Korea with their respective work, earnestly implement their respective patriotic pledges and work plans, and continue to improve their anti-American and patriotic political consciousness.

In order to ensure the realization of this resolution, the meeting called on people from all walks of life to conduct an in-depth inspection of the patriotic movement before "May 1st," discover problems through typical investigations, and convene representative congresses of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in various regions and units separately to discuss and formulate specific plans for carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in depth by combining it with regular work in this region and unit in a prepared manner.
