Advance the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement to a New Stage

　　In the recent five months or more of the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Nation movement, the Chinese people have contributed their strength, and at the same time have been quite universally subjected to patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea, forming an unprecedentedly broad patriotic upsurge. This is the invincible great power of the Chinese people in opposing American aggression, opposing America's separate peace treaty with Japan, opposing America's rearmament of Japan, defending the motherland, and defending Asian and world peace. On this day of struggle for laborers around the world, we Chinese people should further review our strength and advance the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to a new stage.

　　Today, the Chinese people's ideological awareness and political enthusiasm have been greatly enhanced. The "Ma Hengchang Group" emulation campaign has been enthusiastically launched in factories, the campaign for increased production and payment of patriotic public grain has been widely carried out in rural areas, many people in the industrial and commercial sectors are enthusiastically paying taxes, and students and professors are going to the countryside to conduct Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda. The popular slogans among the people are "If American imperialism does not fall, the movement will not stop" and "As long as we work together, we are not afraid of atomic bombs." On the basis of the achievements already made in this patriotic movement, all parts of the country should immediately follow the suggestions in the March 14th circular of the China Peace Committee, promptly continue to popularize the movement and shift from popularization to in-depth and sustained efforts. North China has recently convened a representative conference on Resist America, Aid Korea, and all regions should also convene similar conferences to mobilize the strength of the masses from all strata and industries, concentrate efforts to eliminate blind spots in patriotic education and propaganda work, and work together to deepen and consolidate the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement. Based on the experience of North China, we believe that the following issues should be given attention in the patriotic education work of Resist America, Aid Korea in various regions in the future:

　　First, Party committees at all levels must seize the time with all their strength and concentrate their efforts to attack the weak areas of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. For example, among the 70 million people in North China, as of mid-April, although about 70 to 80 percent have received patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea, there are still 20 to 30 percent of blank or weak areas, so the development of the movement is unbalanced. Taking Tianjin as an example among large cities, according to sampling results, it was found that in some factories, up to 30 percent of workers had not received patriotic education, 50 percent of residents, and 20 percent of schools. In many provinces in North China, residents in remote rural areas and mountain villages, as well as the floating population, have received very little education. Even in areas that have undergone the patriotic movement, a considerable proportion of people have not been educated. According to a sampling of three villages by the Sanhe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei, 28 percent of young and middle-aged men and 31 percent of young and middle-aged women had not received patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea. According to statistics from Kangwan Village, the number of people who usually attend meetings only reaches 16 percent of the total number of people. This imbalance deserves attention. The key to solving this problem lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party committee, earnestly inspecting the implementation of the plan for popularizing propaganda and education, sending people to continue conducting typical investigations to discover various problems, and quickly and effectively helping lower levels solve them. At the same time, higher-level leading organs should allocate more propaganda forces and concentrate on attacking blank and weak areas, such as dispatching propaganda teams and preparing propaganda materials, outlines, and pictures. North China has already used broadcast rallies, window propaganda, propaganda in cultural centers and civil schools, and the system of "contracting" cadres by department and person to conduct propaganda street by street, lane by lane, and household by household in popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, which is welcomed by the people, proving that this is a good way to popularize and deepen propaganda. These propaganda methods should be vigorously advocated and promoted in various regions according to different conditions. This will be of great benefit to future in-depth work.

　　Second, in-depth patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea must further combine the leading backbone of propaganda work with the vast masses of propaganda teams. North China has created good experience in this regard in the past. In last year's winter rectification movement for Communist Party members in North China, patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea was universally carried out. After the trained Party members returned, they became the leading backbone of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in various regions. Last year, in the peace signature movement and the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Nation movement, a large number of activists in propaganda work emerged in North China, playing a significant role. However, due to the insufficient understanding of some regional Party committees regarding the establishment of propagandist work, coupled with a lack of experience, many of these activists were not consolidated into regular propaganda backbones. As a result, the Party's propaganda work among the people could not be further strengthened. This situation has improved since the Party Central Committee issued the decision to establish a propaganda network for the people throughout the Party. However, many regions still do not pay enough attention to the establishment of propaganda networks in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Some even consider it a burden, planning to "establish it after the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education movement is over," or believe that "establishing a propaganda network affects the central work." This is very wrong. It should be recognized that establishing the work of propagandists and reporters is an important key to the transition of Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education work from popularization to in-depth and sustained efforts. Various regions should seize the opportunity to establish and strengthen the Party's work of propagandists and reporters as much as possible, and assign propagandists and reporters to various propaganda teams in a planned manner, so that propaganda work gradually becomes regularized and institutionalized. After May 1st, when various regions summarize the experience of Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education, they should also summarize the work experience of propagandists and reporters, so as to truly exert the role of the propaganda network in deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement and consolidate the achievements of large-scale propaganda activities in various regions around May Day.

　　Third, after May 1st, all regions should seize the opportunity to summarize the mass activities in late April and the May Day patriotic demonstrations, further understand the overall situation of the movement, inspect the propaganda effects, check the implementation of patriotic pledges, commend various propaganda work models, promote advanced experience, discover various problems, and formulate plans for in-depth Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education based on the summary. Promptly guide the mass enthusiasm for Resist America, Aid Korea to strengthening practical work in all aspects, mobilize the masses to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries; factories should more enthusiastically launch the "Ma Hengchang Group" emulation campaign; rural areas should adapt to the current production season, work hard to produce, support Resist America, Aid Korea, and mobilize farmers to strive to complete this year's overall task of agricultural bumper harvest. Regardless of whether in cities or villages, the methods for carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement after May Day should be different from those in late April. The most important thing is to reduce large-scale mass activities, prevent excessive meetings, and pay close attention to cherishing the time and energy of cadres and the masses, so as to persistently carry out ideological education for the people in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement.

### 把抗美援朝运动推进到新的阶段

　　把抗美援朝运动推进到新的阶段
    中国人民在最近五个多月轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动中，贡献了自己的力量，同时也相当普遍地受到了抗美援朝的爱国教育，形成了空前广泛的爱国热潮。这是中国人民反对美国侵略、反对美国单独对日媾和、反对美国重新武装日本、保卫祖国、保卫亚洲与世界和平的不可战胜的伟大力量。当此全世界劳动者战斗的节日，我们中国人民应该进一步检阅我们的力量，把抗美援朝运动推进到新的阶段。
    今天，中国人民的思想觉悟和政治积极性已经大大地提高了。工厂中热烈地展开了“马恒昌小组”竞赛运动，农村中广泛地开展了丰产竞赛和缴纳爱国公粮的运动，工商界中的许多人踊跃纳税，学生教授纷纷下乡进行抗美援朝宣传。人民中流行的口号是“美帝不倒，运动不停”、“只要齐心干，不怕原子弹”。在这个爱国运动已有成绩的基础上，全国各地应即按照中国人民抗美援朝总会三月十四日通告的建议，及时地使运动继续普及并由普及转向深入和持久化。最近华北已经召开了抗美援朝的代表会议，各地也应该召开同样的会议，动员各阶层各行业的群众力量，集中力量消灭爱国教育与宣传工作的空白点，为深入与巩固抗美援朝爱国运动而共同努力。根据华北的经验，我们认为今后各地抗美援朝的爱国教育工作，应注意以下几个问题：
    首先是各级党委必须以全力抓紧时间，集中精力突击抗美援朝运动的薄弱地区。例如华北区七千万人民，受过抗美援朝爱国教育的，截至四月中旬，虽已约达百分之七十到八十的比例，但同时也还存在着百分之二十到三十的空白区或是薄弱区，因此运动的发展是不平衡的。大城市以天津为例，据抽查结果，发现有的工厂未受到爱国教育的工人达百分之三十，居民中占百分之五十，学校中占百分之二十。华北不少省份农村偏僻地区和山庄的居民，以及流动职业的人口很少受到教育。经过爱国运动的地区也还有相当一部分人未受到教育。据中共河北三河县委抽查三个村庄的结果，青壮年男子中有百分之二十八，青壮年妇女中有百分之三十一未受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，其中据康湾村统计，平常参加开会的人数只达到全体人数百分之十六。这种不平衡现象值得注意。解决这一问题的关键在于党委加强领导，切实检查普及宣传教育计划的执行程度，派人继续进行典型调查，以便发现各种问题，并迅速而有效地帮助下级解决。同时高级领导机关要配备较多的宣传力量，集中突击空白区薄弱区，如派遣宣传队，准备宣传材料、宣传提纲、图画等。华北各地在普及抗美援朝运动中已经使用了广播大会，橱窗宣传，在文化馆民校中进行宣传以及规定干部按处按人实行“包干制”，逐街、逐巷、逐片、逐户地进行宣传等办法，受到人民欢迎，证明这是使宣传普及深入的较好方法。这些宣传方式方法，各地均应按照不同条件，大力提倡推广。这对于今后的深入工作会有极大的好处。
    第二、深入抗美援朝爱国教育必须进一步使宣传工作的领导骨干与广大群众的宣传队伍相结合。华北区过去曾在这方面创造了很好的经验，去年华北冬季共产党员整训运动中，曾普遍地进行抗美援朝教育工作，党员受训回去后即成为各地抗美援朝运动的领导骨干。去年在和平签名运动和抗美援朝保家卫国运动中华北曾涌现出大批宣传工作的积极分子，起了很大的作用，但由于有些地区党委对于建立宣传员工作的认识不足，加以缺乏经验，这些积极分子中有许多人没有被巩固下来成为经常的宣传骨干。因而也就使党对人民群众的宣传工作不能进一步加强。这一情况在党中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定发布以后已经有了改进。但是，有不少地区对于在抗美援朝运动中建立宣传网仍重视不够，甚至有人认为这是一个负担，打算到“抗美援朝宣传教育运动完了之后再行建立”，或是认为“建立宣传网影响中心工作进行”。这是十分错误的。应当认识到，建立宣传员报告员工作，是抗美援朝宣传教育工作由普及转入深入、持久的重要关键。各地应抓紧时机尽可能地建立与加强党的宣传员报告员工作，有计划地分配宣传员报告员参加各种宣传队伍，使宣传工作逐渐转入经常化和制度化。“五一”以后，各地在总结抗美援朝宣传教育的经验时，应同时总结宣传员报告员的工作经验，以便在深入抗美援朝爱国运动中真正发挥宣传网的作用，巩固五一劳动节前后各地大规模宣传活动的成果。
    第三、“五一”以后，各地都应抓紧总结四月下旬的群众活动和“五一”爱国大示威的工作，进一步了解运动的全面状况，检查宣传效果，检查爱国公约执行情形，表扬各种宣传工作模范，推广先进经验，发现各种问题，并在总结的基础上制定深入抗美援朝宣传教育的计划。及时地将群众性的抗美援朝热情引导到加强各方面的实际工作中去，发动群众坚决镇压反革命分子；工厂要更热烈地掀起“马恒昌小组”竞赛运动；农村要适应目前生产季节，努力生产，支援抗美援朝，动员农民为争取完成今年农业丰产的总任务而斗争。无论在城市或乡村，五一以后的抗美援朝运动进行的方法，应与四月下旬的有所不同，最重要的是应当减少大规模的群众活动，防止开会过多，并应十分注意珍贵干部和群众的时间与精力，以便在抗美援朝爱国运动中持久地进行对人民的思想教育工作。
