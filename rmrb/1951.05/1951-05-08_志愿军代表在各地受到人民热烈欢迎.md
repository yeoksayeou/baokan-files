Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, Zhang Fu and others arrived in Chongqing by special plane from Xi'an on the afternoon of April 30. Wang Weizhou, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, Chu Tunan, Chairman of the Southwest Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, Luo Shigao, Deputy Mayor of Chongqing, and heads of democratic parties and people's organizations in the city went to the airport to greet them. More than 30,000 people in the city lined the streets to welcome them, constantly offering flowers, flags, letters of condolence, condolence bags, and throwing colorful confetti to the Volunteer Army representatives. Some even danced and sang the "Chinese People's Volunteer Army War Song" following the cars carrying the Volunteer Army representatives. That evening, people from all walks of life in Chongqing held a grand welcome meeting.

　　Before returning to Xi'an, Ji Bingqian and others gave 14 reports in Dihua, Kashgar, Yili and other places in Xinjiang Province, with an audience of 100,300 people. After listening to the reports, people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Dihua City widely relayed and discussed them. The reports of the Volunteer Army representatives became the best propaganda materials for propagandists. Industrial workers who were engaged in the "May 1st" production competition were even more enthusiastic about resisting America and aiding Korea. After listening to the report, the workers of a factory of the Logistics Department of the Xinjiang Military Region exceeded the original quota by 14 percent within four days. After listening to the report, the students asked the school to add military courses and organized propaganda teams to go to the countryside to carry out propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea. He Jiani Yazi Aji, the Grand Imam of the Uyghur ethnic group of Islam in Dihua City, told the Volunteer Army representatives that all religious people supported the Volunteer Army. The Xinjiang Provincial People's Broadcasting Station recorded the reports of the Volunteer Army representatives and translated them into Uyghur for broadcast to the people of Xinjiang. Wherever the Volunteer Army representatives went, they were greeted with flags, gifts and dances from people of all ethnic groups. When they gave reports, the podium was filled with Xinjiang specialties such as raisins, dried apricots, cantaloupe, and hats, carpets and letters of condolences in various languages given by people of all ethnic groups. Women in Dihua City made camel hair shoes and socks overnight to send to the Volunteer Army. Jin Wenxiu, a Hui woman, listened to the Volunteer Army representatives' reports three times in a row, and personally gave her wedding ring and diamonds to the Volunteer Army. The first session of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups presented the Volunteer Army with a brocade flag more than ten feet long, written in four languages: Han, Uyghur, Mongolian, and Kazakh: "You are the vanguard of resisting America and aiding Korea." The Xinjiang People's Democratic League presented the Volunteer Army representatives with three sets of Uyghur national costumes, and sent representatives to personally put the national costumes on the Volunteer Army representatives.

　　Also: Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning representatives Gao Chao, Wang Jianhun, and Li Jitao arrived in Pingyuan Province on the 19th of last month and returned to Beijing on the 29th to participate in the "May 1st" celebrations. Gao Chao and others gave twelve consecutive reports in Xinxiang, Anyang and other places in Pingyuan Province, with an audience of more than 117,000 people. The Provincial People's Broadcasting Station also recorded their reports and broadcast them to the people of the province. These reports powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea in the province. After listening to the report, the workers of the Chengxing Yarn Factory in Xinxiang City immediately put forward the slogan "Treat the factory as a battlefield, spinning one more thread is equal to drawing one more tendon from the American aggressors," and donated two million yuan to buy a large number of daily necessities for the Volunteer Army. After 70,000 people in Xinxiang City listened to the report, they immediately held a declaration to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and signed and voted against the United States arming Japan. The 16 production teams of the Xinxiang Station Inspection Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway immediately formulated a production plan. After listening to the report, the farmers in the suburbs of Xinxiang City unanimously stated that they would resist America and aid Korea by striving for a bumper harvest. Two old ladies in Zangying Village personally carried the eggs they had prepared for their daughters and sons-in-law to the Volunteer Army representatives. After listening to the report, people from the business community also actively checked the implementation of patriotic covenants.
