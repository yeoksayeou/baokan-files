　　Introducing Active Participants in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Old Woman Tian Ziying
    Bai Yuan
    In a small alley outside Hepingmen in Beijing, lives a 58-year-old woman, Tian Ziying. Her husband's surname is Wang. She herself did not have a formal name before, and was simply called Wang Tian Shi. After liberation, the old woman gave herself a name, Tian Ziying. When her husband was young, he was a shoemaker. She married at eighteen, and at nineteen, followed her husband from her hometown in Tong County to Beijing. Her husband worked as a shoemaker in a shoe store, while she stayed at home, gluing shoe uppers, twisting hemp rope, and doing needlework for others. Later, the shoe store closed down, and her husband went to work as a server at a bathhouse. She continued to do needlework and manage household affairs at home. The couple lived a difficult and impoverished life. It wasn't until after the liberation of Beijing that Old Woman Tian Ziying emerged from the small house she had guarded for decades and joined meetings and study sessions with everyone. Under the leadership of the People's Government, she participated in various tasks and quickly became an activist among the masses. Now, she is the street representative, women's committee member, and health committee member in her alley. Because she actively works for the people, everyone in the alley is extremely kind to her. Many people call her "Comrade Tian" when they see her.

    Tian Ziying's work has one difficulty: she is illiterate. When there's something to be done, she asks another street representative to write it down for her. She tells others that this is her hired secretary. When there's a meeting in the alley, she asks her secretary to write it down for her, and then she goes door-to-door to summon everyone. When the district government, women's federation, or health bureau sends a notice, she asks her secretary to read it to her, tell her what it's about, and then she handles each item one by one. On her table, there is a neatly stacked pile of papers, including notes recording various matters, various notices, and various lists. Every night or during other free time, she sits down at the table, flips through these papers, and relies on her memory to identify the different pages and notes, thinking about what remains to be done.

    The old woman is very busy every day; either she is in a meeting, or she is handling various matters for everyone. One day last winter, while it was snowing heavily, a woman was having a difficult labor, and her husband was not at home. She was also facing difficulties in her family. So, she went to the district government to write a free referral letter for the woman and personally took her to the hospital. After returning home, she was still worried, so she personally took the train to Fengtai to call her husband back. Because the old woman was old, cold, and tired, she could hardly get up after lying down upon her return from Fengtai. Tian Ziying said, "At that time, my body was really uncomfortable, but I didn't dare let people know, because I was afraid people would want to thank me, and then it wouldn't be serving the people. Don't you think so? To make revolution one cannot remember these things."

    The old woman never promotes the principles of resisting America and aiding Korea in an isolated and abstract way to the masses, nor does she approach the work of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in isolation. She does a lot of work for the masses every day: from organizing and mobilizing the masses to participate in meetings and parades, to dealing with cases such as a child developing measles in one family, or discord between a couple in another family. She says these are all part of the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. To get everyone to genuinely resist America and aid Korea, we must do many things well, so that everyone knows how lovable our country is. She said, "Just take me, an old woman, for example. Who used to care about me? Who would have let an old woman like me do so much work? Don't you think I should love such a country? Don't you think our motherland is lovable?" This is a lovable old woman. This is an old woman that could only exist in our people's country.

　　田子英老太太
    抗美援朝运动中的积极分子介绍
    白原
    在北京和平门外的一条小胡同里，住着一位五十八岁的田老太太。她的丈夫姓王，她自己从前没有名字，就叫王田氏。解放以后，老太太自己起了个名字，叫田子英。她丈夫年青的时候，是个鞋匠。她十八岁结了婚，十九岁就跟着丈夫从通县老家来到北京。她丈夫在一家鞋店里当鞋匠，她就在家里替人家黏鞋帮，搓麻绳，做针线。后来鞋店关了门，她丈夫跑到一家澡塘里当跑堂看座的，她仍然在家里做做针线，管管家务。两口子过着艰难困苦的日子。直到北京解放以后，田子英老太太才从那守了几十年的小屋子里走了出来，和大伙儿一起开会、学习，在人民政府的领导下参加各种工作，并且很快就成了群众中的积极分子。现在她是她们胡同里的街代表、妇女委员、卫生委员。因为她积极为群众办事，胡同里的人对她都极亲热。许多人见了她，就叫她“田同志”。
    田子英老太太的工作有一个难处：不识字。有什么事情，她就叫另一位街代表给她写下来。她对别人说，这就是她请来的秘书。胡同里要开什么会，她就请秘书给她写下来，到时候她就沿家挨户去召集。区政府、妇联会或是卫生局里来了什么通知，她就请秘书给她看过，告诉她什么事情，然后她就一件一件去办理。在她的桌子上，好好地叠着一叠纸页，里面有记着各种事情的纸条子，有各种通知，还有各种各样的名单。每天夜里或是在其他有空的时候，她就坐下来，在桌旁翻阅这些纸页，凭着自己的记忆，辨认着各种不同的纸页和纸条子，想着还有什么没有办的事情。
    老太太每天的工作都是忙得很的；整天不是开会，就是替大家办理各种各样的事情。去年冬天，有一天正下着大雪，有一个妇女难产，丈夫又不在家，家里有困难。于是她就到区政府去给那一位妇女写了免费介绍信，亲自把她送到医院。回家后她还不放心，又亲自坐火车到丰台去把她的丈夫叫回来。老太太因为年纪大了，又冻又累，从丰台回来一躺下就几乎爬不起来。田子英老太太说：“那时候身子真难受，但是不敢让人家知道，怕人家来领情，这样就不叫为人民服务了。你说是不是？要革命就不能结记这些。”
    老太太从不把抗美援朝的道理孤立、抽象地去向群众宣传，也从不把抗美援朝运动的工作孤立地来做。她每天为群众做很多工作：从组织和动员群众参加开会、游行，到那一家小孩出麻疹、那一家夫妇不和睦的事情，她都去办理。她说这些都是抗美援朝的工作。要使大家都真心来抗美援朝，就要把许多工作都做好，叫大家知道咱们的国家怎样的可爱。她说：“就说我这一个老太太吧，从前有谁理？有谁让过这样一个老太太来做这许多的工作？你说这样的国家我怎么不爱？你说咱们的祖国为什么不可爱？”这是一位可爱的老太太。这是在咱们人民的国家才可能有的老太太。
