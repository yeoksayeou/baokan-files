　　The first National Trade Union Cultural and Educational Work Conference, which began on April 15th, concluded on the 25th. The conference discussed the plans and methods for职工政治教育, spare-time culture, technical education, club activities, workers' newspapers and periodicals, and the use of trade union cultural and educational funds in 1951.

　　Regarding职工政治教育 work, great achievements have been made in the past. In particular, since the widespread patriotic and current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea was carried out in various places in the past six months, the political awareness of workers has been significantly improved. The current issue in current affairs education is how to further deepen and popularize this education and make it regular. To this end, this cultural and educational work conference determined: (1) Trade unions in various places should check the progress of past current affairs education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, as well as the extent of its popularization and depth, and summarize the experience of past work. (2) In factories and mines where no accusations or recollections have been conducted, or where past accusations were not effective, especially in small and medium-sized cities, small and medium-sized factories, and areas where many shop assistants and handicraft workers reside, trade unions should prepare, plan, and organize workers to make accusations, enlighten the workers' class consciousness, and enable the working masses to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. (3) Trade unions should assist the Chinese Communist Party organizations in factories and enterprises to quickly and carefully establish propaganda networks, invite reporters to give a comprehensive current affairs report once a month, and regularly organize reading newspapers and listening to the radio. The conference also determined that trade unions at all levels should conduct systematic theoretical education on class struggle for the working class. Political enlightenment education was conducted in factories and mines in various places in the early days of liberation, but most of them did not last. In order to ensure that employees have systematic and regular theoretical study, the conference decided that illiterate employees should have one hour of theoretical study every two weeks, ensuring 20 hours of study per year; literate employees should study for one hour every week, ensuring 40 hours of study per year. The conference also stipulated that this is a regular learning system. In terms of teaching materials, the conference determined that there should be unified political textbooks. Trade union organizations at all levels should hire party reporters or propagandists with a higher level of political theory to serve as political teachers. In addition, regarding policy education, the conference determined that trade unions in various places should select various policies related to industry and the labor movement and educate workers in light of local conditions.

　　The conference decided that spare-time cultural and technical education for employees should be vigorously developed in the future, believing that this is an important task to improve the cultural and technical level of workers and cultivate a large number of cadres for economic construction. The conference decided: Trade unions in various places should strive to ensure that within the next two to four years, the existing illiterate workers can generally recognize about 1,000 characters and have the ability to read popular books and newspapers. In 1951, 1.5 million employees nationwide should be organized to participate in learning. In order to meet the upcoming economic construction tasks and train a large number of skilled workers, the conference decided that the cultural and educational departments of local or industrial trade union organizations at all levels should work with the education departments of the government at the same level or the administrative aspects of enterprises or the employers at the same level to jointly formulate specific plans, study periods, and conduct inspections and examinations for spare-time technical education for employees.

　　In terms of employee clubs, the conference clearly stipulated that building clubs at the grassroots level is the center and focus of trade union club work. For scattered handicraft workers, shop assistants, or workers in small and medium-sized cities, the focus should be on establishing city or regional clubs. The conference decided to strive to establish clubs for trade union grassroots organizations with more than 300 employees in 1951.

　　Regarding the reorganization of workers' newspapers and periodicals at all levels and how to use trade union cultural and educational funds, the conference also conducted specific research and discussions.

　　首次全国工会文教工作会议闭幕
    确定一九五一年职工政治教育等工作的计划和办法
    自四月十五日开始的第一次全国工会文教工作会议已于二十五日结束。会议讨论了一九五一年职工政治教育、业余文化、技术教育、俱乐部、工人报刊工作及工会文教经费如何使用的计划和办法。
    关于职工政治教育工作，过去曾有很大成绩。特别是近半年来各地普遍进行了抗美援朝的爱国主义时事教育以后，职工的政治觉悟有显著提高。目前时事教育中的问题是如何进一步深入和普及地进行这一教育，并使之经常化。为此，这次文教工作会议确定：（一）各地工会要检查过去抗美援朝时事教育进行的情况和普及与深入的程度，并把过去工作的经验加以总结。（二）在没有进行过控诉、回忆或过去控诉得不好的厂矿，特别是在中小城市、中小工厂以及有很多店员和手工业工人居住的区域，工会应有准备、有计划、有组织地发动工人进行控诉，启发工人的阶级觉悟，使工人群众分清敌我界线。（三）工会应协助工厂企业中中国共产党的组织，迅速而慎重地建立宣传网，每月请报告员作一次综合性的时事报告。经常地组织读报和收听广播。会议并确定各级工会要向工人阶级进行系统的阶级斗争的理论教育。各地厂矿在解放初期曾进行过政治启蒙教育，但大多没有持久下去。为保证职工有系统地经常地进行理论学习，会议决定不识字的职工两星期应有一小时理论学习，一年保证学习二十小时；识字的职工每星期学习一小时，一年保证学习四十小时。会议并规定这是经常的学习制度。在教材方面，会议确定应有统一的政治课本。各级工会组织应聘请党的报告员或政治理论水平较高的宣传员作政治教员。此外关于政策教育，会议确定各地工会应选择与工业、工运有关的各种政策，结合当地具体情况向工人进行教育。
    会议决定今后应大力开展职工业余文化技术教育，认为这是提高工人文化技术水平、大量培养经济建设干部的重要工作。会议决定：各地工会应争取在今后二年到四年内，做到职工中现有的文盲一般能认识一千字左右，并且有阅读通俗书报的能力。在一九五一年内，全国应组织一百五十万职工参加学习。为了迎接将要到来的经济建设任务，培养大批技术工人，会议决定各级地方或产业工会组织的文教部门，应协同同级政府的教育部门或同级的企业行政方面或资方，共同制定职工业余技术教育的具体计划、学习期间，并进行视导和考试。
    在职工俱乐部方面，会议明确规定建设基层组织的俱乐部工作为工会俱乐部工作的中心和重点。对于分散的手工业工人、店员或中小城市的工人群众，则以建立市或区域性的俱乐部为重点。会议决定争取在一九五一年内把有三百以上职工的工会基层组织的俱乐部建立起来。
    关于整理各级工人报刊及如何使用工会文教经费等问题，会议也作了具体的研究和讨论。
