    Hold Unprecedented Grand Demonstrations and Parades for "May Day"
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Chinese people celebrated this year's "May Day" International Labor Day with unprecedented grandeur. In cities and vast rural areas across the country, people of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society, primarily the working people, held demonstration parades and rallies to celebrate their glorious achievements in production and various other endeavors, express their strong determination to love the motherland, resist America and aid Korea, safeguard world peace, and oppose the American rearmament of Japan, and to demonstrate to imperialism. The scale of this demonstration was unprecedentedly grand in many regions. The number of people participating in the demonstration parade was 2.43 million in Shanghai, 800,000 in Shenyang, 610,000 in Tianjin, 600,000 in Chongqing, 500,000 in Guangzhou, 400,000 in Wuhan, 300,000 in Xi'an, and over 200,000 each in Dalian, Nanjing, and Kunming. In cities such as Taiyuan, Guihua, Shijiazhuang, Wuhu, Qingdao, Hefei, Yangzhou, Nanning, Chengdu, Guiyang, Dihua, and Lanzhou, the number of people participating in the parade reached more than 50 percent of the total population of each city. In cities like Ulanhot in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a total of 120,000 people participated in the demonstration parade. Railway workers across the country enthusiastically participated in demonstration parades in various locations. Over 114,000 railway workers in Northeast China and 186,000 railway workers in North and South China participated. The demonstration parades of the broad masses of rural people were also unprecedentedly grand. For example, 200,000 people participated in the suburbs of Beijing; in Xinzhan District, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, more than 12,000 people participated, accounting for more than two-thirds of the district's population.
    In Shanghai, the largest city of peace and democracy in the Far East, parades by people from all walks of life were held simultaneously in thirty districts of the city and on the Huangpu River. At the Racecourse Square in the city center, troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, including the army, navy, and air force, as well as representatives of people from all walks of life, primarily workers, gathered to hold a solemn and grand celebration rally. Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, and leaders of various democratic parties and mass organizations inspected the parade formations. In the ranks of the Shanghai branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, doves of peace and banners inscribed with the signatures of over 3,030,000 people in the city who had endorsed the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers were held high. In the formations of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial trade unions, many placards and charts illustrated the glorious achievements of Shanghai workers' efforts in production. In the parade formations, people also held high many cartoons and banners concerning the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, as well as many charts and placards showing the great achievements of the Shanghai people in implementing patriotic pacts and supporting the Chinese and Korean People's Armies in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. On the Huangpu River, over a hundred ships of various colors, including steamships, dragon boats, and civilian boats, also held a water parade. More than 7,000 sailors were demonstrating to American imperialism the great strength of the new Chinese people and their determination to defend the motherland's coastline.
    In Shenyang, at the crack of dawn, 800,000 organized people, wearing new clothes, holding high red flags, carrying portraits of revolutionary leaders of various countries, beating drums and gongs, performing Yangko dances, singing songs, and shouting slogans, marched towards the nine venues. The solemn and unprecedented grand gathering began at nine o'clock. The various branch venues simultaneously listened to the live broadcast from the central venue. Before the opening of the rally, news of the victory from the Korean front was broadcast over the loudspeakers, and thunderous cheers erupted simultaneously at the nine venues. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, spoke at the rally. When he spoke about resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, those present responded with thunderous applause. The parade began at ten o'clock, with fourteen routes of march proceeding simultaneously in a mighty procession. Worker contingents, led by labor heroes adorned with various medals, held high production models, charts, various types of prize banners, and patriotic pacts. In the parade procession in the Huanggu District, over a thousand farmers from Liutiaohu Village in the suburbs shouted the slogan "Never allow the September 18th Incident to be repeated." They were the ones who had personally heard the first shot fired by the Japanese invaders bombarding the Beidaying barracks in Shenyang twenty years ago. Their participation in the demonstration parade was to express their firm will to oppose the American rearmament of Japan.
    The demonstration parade in Tianjin was also conducted by districts. In the nearly 50,000-strong worker parade contingent in the central district, workers made their own large model of a dove of peace, with a red silk banner bearing the signatures of workers endorsing the declaration for the conclusion of a peace pact held in its beak. Many housewives from all districts participated in the demonstration parade processions. Of the 50,000 people participating in the parade in the Tenth District, housewives accounted for nearly one-third. Fifty-three mothers from Chongqing Road participated in the parade pushing prams, loudly shouting slogans such as "Oppose the American rearmament of Japan" and "Oppose American aggressors slaughtering women and children."
    In Chongqing, the news of the victorious counterattacks by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces on the Korean front and the arrival of the Chinese People's Volunteers' returning representatives, including Ji Bingqian, Zhang Fu, and Li Weiying, on the eve of the festival brought tremendous encouragement to the people. First, 85,000 people in the city held a May Day memorial rally at Datianwan Square. At the same time, over 200,000 parading masses surged towards the Liberation Monument in the city center from the east and west, where they were reviewed by Zhang Jichun, Director of the Municipal Military Control Commission, and others. Representatives of troops from the Kangzang Plateau and Yunnan border region of the motherland were cheered by the crowd. Worker contingents marched shoulder to shoulder with armed forces. Three thousand five hundred workers from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway arrived in Chongqing by special train to participate in the parade, announcing that they would step up the construction of the railway and strive for its full completion as soon as possible. One thousand navy workers in naval uniforms came from ships on the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. All ships, large and small, on the river were adorned in festive attire, shuttling between the two rivers to carry the demonstrating masses.
