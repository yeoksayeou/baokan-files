　　We Should Pay Attention to the Competition Movement of Branches Like Dazhai Village

    The competition movement initiated by the CCP Yushe Dazhai Village, Huguan Shili Village and other branches to lead the patriotic production increase movement well is worthy of attention. The widespread promotion of this competition movement can provide a strong guarantee from the party's grassroots organizations for areas where the patriotic production increase movement has already been launched; and it can enable areas where the patriotic production increase movement has not been launched to quickly launch it under the leadership of the party's grassroots organizations.

    The main content of these branch competitions is to pay close attention to the ideological leadership of the masses. Therefore, the production increase competition movement under the leadership of this branch has rich political content, making participants aware that "more grain harvested means more strength added to the country;" thus closely integrating their economic activities with the country's political struggle.

    Branches and party members who have participated in this competition movement will, from this movement, from their own practice, appreciate the importance of ideological leadership. Only through in-depth ideological leadership, so that the broad masses consciously and actively act, can we ensure that the original production increase plan is exceeded, can the masses further appreciate the correctness of the party's leadership, and can improve the political awareness of the masses. This is the most vivid and richest education for our branches and party members!

　　应当重视大寨村等支部的竞赛运动
    中共榆社大寨村、壶关十里村等支部为领导好爱国丰产运动而发起的竞赛运动，是值得重视的。普遍推广这一竞赛运动，就可使已经展开爱国丰产运动的地区，得到党的基层组织的有力的保证；并可使没有开展爱国丰产运动的地区，在党的基层组织的领导下迅速开展起来。
    这些支部竞赛的主要内容，是十分注意对于群众的思想领导。因此，在这种支部领导下的丰产竞赛运动，就有了丰富的政治内容，使参加竞赛者知道“多收一斗粮食，就多增加国家一分力量”；因而把自己的经济活动与国家的政治斗争紧密结合起来。
    参加了这一竞赛运动的支部和党员，将从这一运动中，从自己的实践中，体会到思想领导的重要。只有经过深入的思想领导，使广大群众自觉地、积极地行动起来，才能保证超过原定的增产计划，才能使群众进一步体会到党的领导的正确，才能提高群众的政治觉悟，这对于我们的支部和党员说来，是一种最生动最丰富的教育！
