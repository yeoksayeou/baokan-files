Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 26th: According to TASS, Washington, May 24th, the U.S. House of Representatives began debating a bill on May 22nd regarding a $190 million food loan to India. Many congressmen slandered India and the Indian people. Opponents of the bill openly insulted India, while proponents implied that the U.S. food loan would be enough to buy India's support for U.S. war policies.

Cox (Democrat from Georgia), an opponent of the bill, initiated the debate by attacking India for not supporting U.S. policies in the United Nations and for not sending troops to join the armed intervention in Korea. His remarks contained language insulting the Indian people and violating their customs.

House Speaker Rayburn urged the passage of the bill, stating that if the bill was rejected rashly, the United States would lose allies abroad. Judd (Republican from Minnesota) and Ribicoff (Democrat from Connecticut) more explicitly emphasized that the primary purpose of the bill was not humanitarianism, but to strive to win an ally in Asia for the United States. Durham (Democrat from North Carolina) urged the passage of the bill because the United States needed India to supply manganese ore.

Note: The U.S. Senate passed the bill on May 16th, stipulating that the $190 million loan for purchasing food should be subject to the same restrictions as the Marshall Plan loans. The bill specifically stipulates that India must include monocrystalline minerals and manganese in the exchange goods it provides to the United States.

　　美众院讨论印度粮食贷款案竟诽谤印度和印度人民
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿二十四日讯：五月二十二日，美国众院开始辩论关于给印度一亿九千万元粮食贷款的法案，有许多众议员诽谤印度和印度人民。反对这个法案的人公然侮辱印度，而提案人则暗示说：美国的粮食贷款足以收买印度来支持美国的战争政策。
    反对这个法案的科克斯（乔治亚州民主党人）发言攻击印度在联合国组织中不支持美国的政策，而且不派军队去参加在朝鲜的武装干涉军，他就这样开始了辩论。他的发言含有侮辱印度人民并且渎犯他们的风俗习惯的言辞。
    众院议长雷朋吁请通过这个法案，他声明说：如果轻率地否决了这个法案，美国就会在国外失掉友邦了。周以德（明尼苏达州共和党人）和芮比科夫（康涅狄格州民主党人）更露骨地着重指出：这个法案的主要目的并不在于什么人道主义，而是要努力为美国在亚洲争取一个同盟国。杜兰（北卡罗来纳州民主党人）敦促通过这个法案，因为美国需要印度供应锰矿砂。
    按：美国参院已于五月十六日通过该法案，法案规定一亿九千万购买粮食的贷款应受到和马歇尔计划贷款同样的限制。法案特别规定印度在给美国的交换物资中一定要包括单晶矿和锰。
