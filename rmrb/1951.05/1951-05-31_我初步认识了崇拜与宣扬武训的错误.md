Editor's note: The author of this article, Mr. Li Shizhao, is the author of "Wu Xun Illustrated Biography." We believe that publishing such a review article is helpful for continuing the discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun," so we are publishing it here. We hope readers will write to us with any opinions after reading this article.

In the past, my understanding of Wu Xun as a person was always trapped in serious traditional errors. On March 25th, the Tianjin Progress Daily disclosed Mr. Qing Yi's article "Wu Xun is Not Our Good Tradition." Subsequently, issues 37 and 38 of the Wenyi Bao successively published Comrade Jia Ji's "Wu Xun is Not Worthy of Emulation" and Comrade Yang Er's "A Tentative Discussion on Whether Mr. Tao Xingzhi's Praise of 'Wu Xun Spirit' Has Any Positive Effect." After these two important articles, my thinking about Wu Xun did not experience any fluctuations. I was exposed to his story as a primary school student, and as a middle school student, I read Mr. Liang Qichao's "Biography of Wu Xun," Mr. Cai Yuanpei's "Mr. Wu Xun Reminds Us," Mr. Liu Bannong's "Mr. Wu Qi's Personality," Mr. Shu Xincheng's "Wu Xun's Position in the History of Education," Mr. Sun Fuyuan's "Shu Ding," and many other articles and eulogies written about him over the years. Because I was a normal school student at that time, I naturally felt a special interest in studying this figure who was closely related to the education cause. Around the time of the Anti-Japanese War, I also read Mr. Duan Chengze and Mr. Sun Zhijun's "Wu Xun Illustrated Biography," Mr. Zhang Mosheng's "Biography of Wu Xun," and Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Mr. Wu Xun's Three Haves and Four Nos," and several articles published by Mr. Tao after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, such as "Liberating Mr. Wu Xun," which gradually led me to a deeper and more erroneous understanding of Wu Xun, and further strengthened my position of supporting and praising him, and doing my best to eulogize this anti-historical materialist figure who was "not worthy of emulation" and "should not be praised." I even spent a long time and a lot of energy to collect and excavate historical materials related to him, and by the end of 1948, I had collected 133 articles totaling more than 200,000 words. In 1950, I synthesized various materials and wrote a biography for him (i.e., "Wu Xun Illustrated Biography"). Not only was the criticism of historical materials not in-depth enough, but I also committed a serious error of objectivism. It was not until I read the editorial in the Beijing People's Daily on May 20th, "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," that I was rescued from the abyss of traditional errors I had been immersed in and began to liquidate my past backward understanding of Wu Xun, and break down the confused viewpoints existing in my mind. When I reread the various articles published in the Beijing and Tianjin newspapers and periodicals since March 15th, refuting the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and criticizing Wu Xun himself, my past erroneous views were preliminarily clarified and improved.

On March 18th, Wang Yibo's "Opinions on 'Wu Xun Illustrated Biography'" was published in the 11th issue of the Beijing People's Daily Book Review, pointing out the problem of Wu Xun often using methods such as "kneeling and begging." Because my personal historical knowledge was limited and my historical views were not scientific enough, I consulted a historian about Wu Xun's evaluation in Chinese people's history in order to consider the reply. He gave me a lot of inspiration, but did not put forward a conclusive opinion. He hoped that I would write directly to several revolutionary progressives in the educational and historical circles to ask them to put forward more profound opinions on Wu Xun as a preliminary summary. In order to compile an index of articles published in newspapers and periodicals in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin since the release of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" as a reference, and because the materials were not complete for a while, those letters have not been written. When the Beijing People's Daily reprinted the articles of Comrades Yang Er and Jia Ji on May 16th and 17th, I still thought that this was just the opinion of literary critics who denied the film, and I felt that they had not fully grasped the historical materials and could only be used as literary criticism. If they were used to deny a historical figure who had been "affirmed" and "praised" by people for fifty or sixty years, it would not be powerful enough. I once wanted to combine Mr. Jiang Hua's "Suggestions for the Education Circle to Discuss the Biography of Wu Xun" and Mr. Shuting's "Clarifying the Controversy of the Biography of Wu Xun" in Renwu Magazine to suggest the issue of "the educational, historical, and literary circles widely discussing the biography of Wu Xun," feeling that this would lead to a more correct conclusion and improve everyone's understanding. However, since the Beijing People's Daily published an editorial and called on "Communist Party members to participate in the criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun'," the problem was put forward more clearly, although I am not a Communist Party member, it also made my personal blind worship of Wu Xun begin to waver in my mind.

I reviewed that in the past, under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, we used the name "Wu Xun" as a superficial excuse to carry out the democratic struggle for people's democracy and freedom. This would combine the insignificant traces of Wu Xun in history with the democratic political movement. This would mislead people or wrongly identify him as a "class fighter," and because he was born of the working people and his "hard work and endurance" style of thirty years as one day, it would mislead people into thinking that he "was a great typical representative of the working people." In addition, in those years, many advanced patriotic democrats also wrote many articles praising him without in-depth analysis, linking "Wu Xun" with the democratic political movement, which invisibly increased his political nature and political status, forming today's erroneous understanding of him in the cultural and educational circles and among the people.

I recall that Mr. Tao Xingzhi, in 1943, during the most difficult stage of the Chinese people's Anti-Japanese War, proposed the slogan of "New Wu Xun Movement" to encourage everyone to firmly fight for the democratic education movement under the reactionary rule. His good intentions are understandable! And it has a positive effect. For example, Mr. Tao Xingzhi held a "Memorial Wu Xun" conference in Chongqing. Although it was formally "Memorial Wu Xun," it was essentially a very strong political struggle. The content of the conference was all about "the people demanding democracy from the reactionary regime." He invited many advanced patriotic democrats to give speeches, and the topics were all real and living issues of the people fighting for democracy, rarely talking about Wu Xun himself. Because at that time, without using "Memorial Wu Xun" as an excuse, it was impossible to open a mass gathering of thousands of people under the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, the political activities of revolutionary intellectuals were always prohibited or regarded as illegal by the reactionaries. It is very clear that what they prohibited was revolutionary political activities, not "Memorial Wu Xun." On the contrary, they, like the reactionary rulers of all dynasties, gave Wu Xun a commendation to paralyze the people's fighting spirit. For another example, after Mr. Tao's death, we once ran a school named "Wu Xun" in Shanghai. It was also under the pretext of him that we actually carried out democratic education. Under such a cover, many revolutionary students and democratic teachers were buried together to carry out revolutionary propaganda work, which was also banned by the reactionaries. This has nothing to do with "Wu Xun" himself. What they are hostile to is this people's democratic political activity. On the contrary, the official "Memorial Wu Xun" gatherings and school groups named "Wu Xun" that were not related to the democratic movement were all supported by them! It seems that the cause and activities named "Wu Xun" are also divided into two camps. Because the democratic front has an absolute advantage and a wide range of influence, it causes people to misunderstand Wu Xun. In fact, Wu Xun is not a person with political activities at all. He has no connection with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement in fact. In the articles and legends, it has never been seen that he had any relationship with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement. Also, the saying that Wu Xun sold braids in the movie is even more fictionalized by the screenwriter, and he never kneeled and kowtowed to anyone he saw. I think that when Mr. Tao promoted the "Wu Xun Spirit," he infused his own spirit into it, which has played a certain progressive role, and it is precisely because of this that Wu Xun's "political prestige" has been raised. The fictional and unreasonable stories in the film "The Life of Wu Xun" do slander the Chinese peasant revolution, slander the Chinese nation and Chinese history, which Mr. Tao never thought of during his lifetime. I affirm that all those who worshiped Wu Xun because they were influenced by Mr. Tao's promotion of "Wu Xun Spirit" have their active side, because Mr. Tao advocated "education for the people" and "culture for the public." Those who have seen Wu Xun in the movie must have caused his confused thinking. This responsibility lies with the film, not with Mr. Tao.

I review my personal consistent erroneous understanding of Wu Xun for the past 20 years. In addition to being influenced by the writings of the aforementioned gentlemen, the main reason is that I have committed the errors of narrow sectarianism and narrow patriotism in education. I am an educator myself, and I thought that Wu Xun was a figure related to traditional educational thought, and I once regarded him as a "model" for my own study. When reading the history of education, I learned that a famous Pestalozzi appeared in the history of European education, and since Wu Xun appeared in Chinese history, I naturally wanted to regard him as China's Pestalozzi to show the "glory" that should exist in Chinese history. Secondly, because Wu Xun is from Shandong, such a historical figure "better than Confucius" appeared on our plains, and I stood on the feudal concept of loving my hometown, so I worshiped him even more. Furthermore, I know that during the Anti-Japanese War, Tangyi was once renamed "Wu Xun County" (1943-1949), so I felt that it should be promoted even more, for fear that it would not be deeply popularized, I have been constantly collecting and excavating all the documents about him, and editing them, writing a "biography" for him from his life to his death, intentionally deleting some of his backward views, such as the anti-scientific thoughts of "yin zhi" in his sayings, and avoiding them, trying to write him as a "great typical of the working people," and naturally made the mistake of speculation.

I review that when I first read some articles that disagreed with praising Wu Xun, I thought that Wu Xun in the movie was too different from Wu Xun in history, and the fictional characters and stories had uglified Wu Xun. The real face of Wu Xun in history is not like this! Taking a step back: "Wu Xun was still a good person in the old society, right?" In Chinese feudal society, poor people could not study. As a poor peasant, he spontaneously stood up to create educational opportunities for the people, using his own labor to accumulate money to run an "yi shu" that was different from the "official schools" and "private schools" that served the children of the bureaucratic landlord class, without charging tuition, so that the children of the poor could also study. Shouldn't he have his "people's nature"? Moreover, Wu Xun's career was not isolated. In the society at that time, he also had a certain mass base. Although he never talked about revolution, we don't have to force him into the ranks of the revolution, but at least he should be a "reformist" with a certain degree of progressiveness, right? This kind of ideological consciousness is still constantly emerging in my thinking. When the Beijing Guangming Daily published "Responding to the Editorial of the People's Daily" (Cultural circles should thoroughly clarify the confused thinking reflected in the "Wu Xun Biography" issue) on May 21st, it further specifically pointed out: "Wu Xun is a supporter of feudal rule, a worshiper of the feudal system, and a supporter of feudal morality. His spirit is servile, wagging his tail and begging for mercy, and serving the ruling class. His actions are actions that deny struggle, deny progress, hinder revolution, and hinder social development. His influence is to blur the awareness of class struggle, distort the facts of historical development, and demand surrender to the reactionary feudal rule. No matter from which angle you look at Wu Xun and his affairs, it is absolutely not right and not worth praising or eulogizing today." After reading this editorial, my previous erroneous understanding was indeed initially clarified and improved.

I examined that among all the papers and works on Wu Xun listed in the People's Daily editorial, I am one of the more serious mistakes in thinking. Because I not only wrote a "biography" for him, but also did a lot of specific work under this erroneous pretext, causing many adverse effects. After studying the People's Daily editorial and all the papers related to the discussion of Wu Xun Biography, I have clearly recognized that Wu Xun is a historical figure with no progressiveness. My own historical knowledge in the past was too insufficient, and I made mistakes that affected others. In the future, I personally will pay attention to studying the summaries of the discussion on the issue of "Wu Xun Biography" across the country; and strengthen the study of historical materialism in order to thoroughly eradicate the problems existing in my thinking, and hope to gradually improve. When the discussion of the film "Wu Xun Biography" began not long ago, I had already notified the bookstore to stop the reprint of "Wu Xun Illustrated Biography." I earnestly hope that all comrades who have seen the film "Wu Xun Biography" or read "Wu Xun Illustrated Biography" can enthusiastically participate in the discussion of "Wu Xun Biography" and earnestly study all the documents related to the discussion of "Wu Xun Biography" and re-examine the erroneous effects they have suffered in the past.

　　我初步认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误
    李士钊
    编者按：这篇文章的作者李士钊先生是《武训画传》的作者。我们认为发表这样的检讨的文章，对于继续展开关于《武训传》的讨论是有帮助的，因此把它发表在这里。希望读者看了这篇文章有什么意见尽量写来。
    过去我对于武训这个人的认识，一直是陷在严重的传统的错误中。在三月二十五日的天津进步日报，披露了晴簃先生所写的《武训不是我们的好传统》，以至文艺报三十七、八两期先后刊载了贾霁同志的《不足为训的武训》和杨耳同志的《试论陶行知先生表扬“武训精神”有无积极作用》两篇重要的论文以后，对于武训这个人，在我的思想上还没有受到任何波动。我小学生时代就接触了他的故事，中学生时代读了梁启超先生的《武训传》，蔡元培先生的《武训先生提醒了我们》，刘半农先生的《武七先生的人格》，舒新城先生的《武训在教育史上的地位》，孙伏园先生的《竖鼎》等文章，以及历年别人写的很多关于他的传记，年表，称颂的文字。由于那时候我正是一个师范学生，对于这个与教育事业有重要关连的人物，自然特别感觉有研究的兴趣。抗日战争前后，我又读了段承泽、孙之俊先生合作的《武训先生画传》，和张默生先生的《武训传》，以及陶行知先生的《武训先生的三有四无》，和陶先生在抗日战争胜利以后所发表的《解放武训先生》等几篇文章，使我慢慢地由浅入深地对武训这个人物进入更错误的理解阶段，进一步更坚决地站在拥护与表扬他的立场，去尽力地歌颂了这个“不足为训”和“不应歌颂”的反历史唯物主义的人物。甚至花费很长的时间和很多的精力去搜集发掘和他有关的历史资料，截至一九四八年底已收存了一百三十三篇共计二十多万字。一九五○年我又综合了各种材料，为他写了一篇传记（即《武训画传》）。非但对史料的批判不够深入，而且犯了严重的客观主义的错误。直到五月二十日读了北京人民日报的社论：《应该重视电影“武训传”的讨论》后，才把我从一贯的沉在传统错误的深渊里打救出来，开始清算了我过去对武训这个人物的落后认识，打垮了我思想上存在的糊涂观点。等我再重读三月十五日以来，北京天津各报刊所发表过的各种驳斥电影《武训传》和对武训本人的批判的文章，我对于过去的错误看法，才得到初步的澄清和提高。
    三月十八日北京人民日报书报评论第十一期发表了王一波先生的《对“武训画传”提意见》，他指出武训经常采用“跪请”“跪求”等方式的问题。我因为个人的历史知识有限，历史观点不够科学，为了考虑回答的意见，去请教一位史学家，关于武训在中国人民历史上的评价问题。他给我很多启发，但并未提出结论性的意见。他希望我直接写信向几位教育界史学界的革命先进去请教，请他们对武训提出较深刻的意见作为初步的总结。我为了想把电影《武训传》上演以来，上海北京天津各地报刊所发表过的文章，编成一个索引作为参考，又因一时材料不齐，那几封信一直都未能写成。等到五月十六日、十七日北京人民日报再度转载了杨耳和贾霁两同志的论文，我还以为这不过是文艺批评家否定电影的意见，觉得他们未能充分掌握历史材料，只能作为文艺批评，如果用来否定一个五六十年来为人们所“肯定”“歌颂”的历史人物，则是不够有力的。我曾想综合江华先生的《建议教育界讨论武训传》和人物杂志上书亭先生的《将武训传的争论明确起来》，建议“教育界史学界文艺界广泛的讨论武训传”的问题，觉得这样才可以得出一个比较正确的结论，提高大家的认识。但是自从北京人民日报发表了社论，并号召“共产党员应当参加关于‘武训传’的批判”，问题更明确的提出来，我虽然不是一个共产党员，但也使我个人过去对武训这个人物的盲目崇拜，在思想上开始发生了动摇。
    我检讨过去在蒋介石的反动统治下，我们为了进行争民主要自由的民主斗争，曾采用了“武训”的名字作为表面上的借托。就把这一历史上不足道的武训的陈迹，和民主的政治运动结合起来。这样会使人们迷惑或错认他是一个“阶级斗士”，更因为他出身劳动人民和他三十年如一日的“吃苦耐劳”的作风，使人误认他“是一个劳动人民的伟大典型”，再加上在那些年代，有不少的先进爱国的民主人士，也未加深刻分析地把“武训”与民主政治运动连在一起，写过很多赞扬他的文章，无形中增高了他的政治性和政治地位，形成今天文化教育界和人民群众中对他的错误认识。
    我回忆陶行知先生在一九四三年中国人民抗日战争最艰苦的阶段，他为了鼓励大家坚决地在反动统治下，为坚持民主教育运动的斗争，而提出“新武训运动”口号的苦心，是可以理解的！而且是有积极作用的。譬如陶行知先生在重庆举办“纪念武训”的大会，形式上虽说是“纪念武训”，而实质上却是一个如火如荼的政治性很强烈的斗争。会的内容全是说的“人民向反动政权要民主”的问题。他请了很多位先进的爱国民主人士去讲演，话题都是现实的活生生的人民争民主的问题，绝少谈到武训的本身。因为那时候不借托“纪念武训”，无法在蒋介石的反动统治下，开一个几千人的群众集会。当时革命知识分子的政治活动，随时都遭到反动派的禁止或视为非法。很明确的，他们禁止的是革命的政治活动，而不是禁止“纪念武训”，相反的他们也像历代的反动统治者一样的给武训以旌表，以麻痹人民的斗争思想。再如陶先生逝世后，我们曾在上海办过以“武训”为名的学校，也是以他为借托实际是进行民主教育，在这样的掩护下，埋藏了不少革命学生和民主教师，一齐来进行革命的宣教工作，也遭到反动派的查封，这和“武训”本身更毫无关系，他们所敌视的是这人民民主政治活动。相反地官办的“纪念武训”的集会，和与民主运动不相干的以“武训”为名的学校团体，都得到了他们的扶植与支持！好像以“武训”为名的事业与活动，也分成两个壁垒，由于民主阵线的声势占绝对的优势，影响的广阔，就引起人们对武训的错误认识。其实武训根本是一个没有政治活动的人，他与太平天国运动在事实上毫无牵连，从来的文章和传说中也没见过他对太平天国运动有过什么关系。还有像电影上的武训卖打一说，更是编剧者所虚构的，而且他绝不是见了人就下跪磕头。我以为陶先生提倡“武训精神”的时候，曾把自己的精神灌注上去，曾起过一定的进步作用，也正因此而更抬高了武训的“政治声望”。电影《武训传》上那些虚构的不合情理的故事，确是污蔑了中国的农民革命，污蔑了中国民族和中国历史，这些在陶先生生前是绝没有想到的。我肯定凡是因为受陶先生提倡“武训精神”的薰陶而崇拜过武训的人，都有其积极性，因为陶先生提倡“教育为人民”和“文化为公”。看过电影上的武训的人，一定造成他的混乱思想。这个责任在电影，而不能归之于陶先生。
    我检讨个人二十年来对于武训一贯的错误认识，除了受前述诸先生文字的影响外，主要是犯了教育上狭隘的宗派主义与狭隘的爱国思想的错误。自己是一个教育工作者，以为武训是传统的教育思想有关的人物，曾把他奉为自己学习的“楷模”，读教育史的时候，知道欧洲教育史上出现过一位有名的丕士托罗齐，中国历史上有了武训的出现，自然愿意奉他为中国的丕士托罗齐，以显示中国历史上应有的“光荣”。其次因为武训是山东人，在我们这块平原上，出现了这么一位“比孔子且有过之”的历史人物，我站在封建的爱乡土的观念上，就更加对他崇拜起来。再者，我知道抗日战争期间，堂邑曾一度改为“武训县”（一九四三——一九四九），因之更觉得应该表扬，唯恐不能深入普及，一直不断地去搜集发掘所有关于他的一切文件，并加以修剪，为他写成一篇从生前到死后的“传记”，有意地删除他的若干落后观点，如在他的说词中有讲到“阴骘”的反科学的思想等，都规避了去，把他尽量写成一个“劳动人民的伟大典型”，自然会犯了附会的错误。
    我检讨当我初读到一些不同意表扬武训的文章后，认为电影上的武训，与历史上的武训出入太大，虚构的人物和故事，把武训给丑化啦。历史上武训的真实面目并不如此呀！退一万步说：“武训在旧社会还是个好人吧？”在中国的封建社会里，穷人不能念书，他以一个穷苦农民的身份，自发地起来为人民创造受教育的机会，用自己的劳动力去积钱办个与为官僚地主阶级的子弟服务的“官学堂”、“私塾”不同的“义塾”，不收学费，使穷人的子弟也能念书，总该有他的“人民性”吧？况且武训的事业并不是孤立的，在当时的社会里，还有他一定的群众基础，虽然他不曾谈革命，我们也不必把他勉强的排进革命的行列中，但至少他还该是一个有一定进步性的“改良主义者”吧？这种思想意识还不断在我的思路中涌现出来。等到五月二十一日北京光明日报发表了《响应人民日报的社论》（文化界应彻底澄清《武训传》问题所表现的混乱思想），更进一步具体地指出：“武训是封建统治的拥护者，封建制度的崇拜者，封建道德的支持者。他的精神是奴颜婢膝，摇尾乞怜，为统治阶级服务的精神。他的行动是否定斗争，否定进步的行动，阻滞革命，阻滞社会发展的行动。他的影响是模糊阶级斗争的意识，歪曲历史发展的事实，要求向反动的封建统治投降。不论在任何角度来看武训其人其事，今天是绝对不应该、不值得加以表扬或歌颂的。”我读了这个社论，我以往的错误认识，才的确得到初步的澄清和提高。
    我检查人民日报的社论中，所列举的一切关于武训的论文和著作中，我是思想上犯错误较严重的一个。因为我不但为他写了“传记”，还在这一错误的借托之下，做过许多具体的工作，造成很多不良的影响。我经过学习人民日报的社论和一切有关讨论武训传的论文，已明确地认清楚武训是一个毫无进步性的历史人物，过去自己的历史知识太不够，自己犯了错误还影响了别人。今后我个人将注意学习全国各地对于《武训传》这一问题讨论的总结；并更加强学习历史唯物主义，以彻底根除自己思想上所存在的毛病，并期能逐步提高。当电影《武训传》的讨论开始不久，我已通知书店停止了《武训画传》的再版，我剀切地盼望凡是看过电影《武训传》或读过《武训画传》的同志们，都能热烈地参加《武训传》的讨论，并认真地学习关于讨论《武训传》的一切文件，重新检讨过去所受的错误影响。
