To the Editor:

In the 94th issue of the People's Daily's "People's Literature and Art" section, there is an article by Comrade Liu Enqi, "A Theme Urgently Awaiting Depiction – Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries." I think the issue raised in this article is extremely important. Literary and art workers in various regions should pay attention to it and try to depict this theme based on the spirit of this article.

Before I saw this article, I approached many young students and some rural worker-peasant cadres who loved literature and art. They asked me in unison: "After our government formulated the 'Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries' based on the Common Program, it has resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionary elements. This is the urgent demand of the people of the whole country and a necessary measure to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Our literary and art workers should write this major event into novels, poems, dramas... to meet our demands." Why are there so few of these kinds of literary and artistic works? Of course, long works require considerable time, but if we look through various literary and art magazines, there are still too few short and concise works that express this theme, which shows that literary and artistic work lags behind reality.

I am a novice writer, and I will strive to fulfill the requirements of the Party newspaper for us, and use my pen to express this theme—suppressing counter-revolutionaries; at the same time, I hope that all literary and art workers can also pay full attention to this issue.

### 各地文艺工作者  应表现镇压反革命的主题

　　各地文艺工作者
    应表现镇压反革命的主题编辑同志：
    人民日报人民文艺第九十四期，载有刘恩启同志的一篇文章——《一个急待表现的主题——镇压反革命》。我认为这篇文章所提的问题极其重要。各地文艺工作者，应该予以注意，并应根据这篇文章的精神，设法表现这个主题。
    在我还没有看到这篇文章之前，我接近过许多青年学生和一些农村中爱好文艺的工农干部，他们异口同声地问我：“我们政府根据共同纲领制定了‘惩治反革命条例’以后，已对反革命分子进行了坚决的镇压，这是全国人民迫切的要求，是巩固人民民主专政必要的措施。我们的文艺工作者应该将这个大事件写成小说、诗歌、戏剧……来满足我们的要求。”为什么这类的文艺作品还不多见呢？固然长篇的著作需要相当时日，但是让我们翻阅一下各种文艺杂志，就是表现这个主题的短小精悍的作品还是太少，这就表现文艺工作落后于现实。
    我是个初学写作者，我要努力实现党报对我们的要求，用我的笔来表现这个主题——镇压反革命；同时，我希望一切文艺工作者也能充分注意这个问题。
