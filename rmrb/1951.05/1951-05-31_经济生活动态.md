　　　　Large swarms of locust nymphs discovered in Huanghua and Lulong, Hebei
　　　　Local governments actively organize the masses to catch and kill them

　　In the area of Banbianjing Village, Seventh District, Huanghua County, Cangxian Special District, Hebei Province, locust nymphs were discovered on May 14th, covering an area of approximately thirty square li. Upon hearing the news, the county and district people's governments immediately went to the area to organize a locust-catching headquarters and mobilize the masses to catch and kill them. The director of the Cangxian Special District Farm also brought 2,000 jin of "666" powder and 60 sprayers, traveling by car to assist in the killing. In Xiwuzhuang, Huyi, and other four villages in the Fourth District of Lulong, Tangshan Special District, locust nymphs measuring about two to four fen in length were discovered before May 6th, covering an area approximately seven li long and three li wide. In some areas, half of the sorghum and millet had already been eaten. Under the leadership of the county and district people's governments, the four villages organized 3,800 people on the 7th and 8th to launch a concentrated attack, eliminating 70% of the locust nymphs.

　　Last year, locusts occurred in many areas, and some areas inevitably had autumn locusts scattered to lay eggs. Therefore, these areas may still have locusts this year. All localities should pay close attention to this, and take advantage of the gap between the end of spring plowing and sowing and the start of wheat harvesting to organize the masses to find and dig up locust eggs. At the same time, it is necessary to establish an inspection and intelligence system to ensure that locusts are eliminated wherever they appear.

　　　　Continuous rain in Fujian causes damage, rice and wheat suffer losses
　　　　Governments at all levels lead the people to actively rescue

　　In Fujian Province, continuous rain for more than fifty days in March and April this year caused flooding. Thirty percent of the province's total cultivated land, planted with early rice seedlings, was either washed away or rotted due to flooding. Winter wheat crops, which were in bloom, will be completely lost after being flooded. Those that had already formed grains suffered a general loss of 30% to 50% due to germination or root rot. The Fujian Provincial People's Government has determined that rescuing seedlings, harvesting wheat, and carrying out social mutual assistance to prevent summer famine are the overriding central tasks within the next month. In most areas of the province, Party organizations and government agencies have promptly convened cadre meetings, veteran farmer forums, and mass meetings to conduct in-depth mobilization and launch a seedling protection and wheat harvesting campaign. To support this work, the Provincial People's Bank has allocated an additional 3 billion yuan in agricultural loans to help farmers rescue seedlings. The Provincial People's Government Civil Affairs Department has allocated 2 million jin of emergency relief rice to poor and hired farmers in severely affected areas to prepare for surviving the famine.

　　Thanks to the government's active mobilization and economic support, rescue work has achieved certain results. For example, in most areas of the suburbs of Fuzhou City, wheat is being actively harvested and floodwater is being drained. Social mutual assistance has been launched for farmers who have run out of food due to the disaster. Farmers in Chengguan District, Changle County, used mutual assistance methods to lend grain, solving the problem of replanting difficulties, and all seedlings in the district have been replanted. If the disaster situation in the province does not worsen, it is estimated that most areas can still harvest 50% to 70% of the wheat, and 50% to 60% of the seedlings can be maintained. With the addition of government loans and relief, the famine can be prevented. (Zheng Tingzhi)

            河北黄骅卢龙发现大片蝗蝻
            当地政府积极组织群众捕打
    河北省沧县专区黄骅县七区半边井村一带，于五月十四日发现蝗蝻，面积约三十平方里。县区人民政府闻讯后，即前往该地组织捕蝗指挥部，发动群众捕打。沧县专区农场场长并携带“六六六”粉两千斤，喷粉器六十架，乘汽车赶往该地协助捕杀。唐山专区卢龙四区西吴庄、胡峪等四村，于五月六日前发现约二分至四分长的蝗蝻，面积约七里长，三里宽，部分地区的高粱、谷子已被吃掉一半。在县区人民政府领导下，该四村于七、八两日即组织群众三千八百人突击捕打，已消灭蝗蝻达百分之七十。
    去年不少地区均曾发生蝗虫，有些地区难免有秋蝗散伏产卵，因此，这些地区今年仍有发生蝗虫的可能。各地对此应密切注意，趁目前春耕播种结束、麦收尚未开始时的空隙，组织群众寻挖蝗卵；同时要建立检查情报制度，保证蝗虫出现在那里，就把它消灭在那里。
            福建霪雨为患稻麦遭受损失
            各地政府领导人民积极抢救
    福建省今春三、四月间连续下雨五十余天，致成水患。占全省耕地总面积百分之三十的早稻秧苗，有的被水冲掉，有的被淹霉烂。冬季作物的小麦，正在开花的被水冲后，将全部失收；已结实的，因麦粒发芽或麦根腐烂，一般的损失三至五成。福建省人民政府已确定以抢救秧苗与抢收小麦及开展社会互济防止夏荒为最近一个月以内压倒一切的中心任务。全省大部分地区中共党组织与政府机关已及时召开干部会、老农座谈会、群众会，进行深入动员，展开护秧抢麦运动。为配合这一工作，省人民银行增拨农业贷款三十亿元，帮助农民救护秧苗。省人民政府民政厅已拨出紧急救济粮大米二百万斤，发放给重灾区受害的贫、雇农民，准备度荒。
    由于政府的积极动员和经济上的支持，抢救工作已获得一定效果。如福州市郊大部地区正积极抢割小麦和排除积水。对因灾陷入断炊的农户已发动社会互济。长乐县城关区农民用互助办法，借出谷粮，解决了补种困难，全区秧苗已全部补种完毕。该省灾情如不再发展，估计多数地区小麦尚可收五至七成；秧苗可保持五至六成。加上政府的贷款救济，灾荒是可以制止的。（郑廷植）
