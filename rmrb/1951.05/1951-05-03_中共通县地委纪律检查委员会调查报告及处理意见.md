To the Editor:

　　After receiving Li Shucheng's letter forwarded by the newspaper, we, along with several county and district cadres from the Tongxian Sub-branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court and Xianghe County, went to Wangdianzi Village for investigation. The situation reflected by Li Shucheng is basically true. Some cadres in the village do have many serious errors in their behavior. For example, village head Lu Yucheng privately fined the masses a total of more than 8,000 catties of corn because they concealed land, picked branches, and spread strange stories. Although the fined grain was used to build a school in the village, and Lu Yucheng did not embezzle it personally, this method was wrong. Village head Lu Yucheng and Farmers' Association Director Li Xirong, among others, also frequently beat and detained people in their work. Some village cadres also engaged in extravagant eating and drinking and wasteful practices. For example, when the village built the school, due to the village cadres leading the way in eating, drinking, and wasting, it took 16,000 to 17,000 catties of rice to build three school rooms. Village cadres also engaged in serious waste when managing the firewood cooperative. Although there were no specific facts of embezzlement, the failure to clear accounts with the cooperative members after it ended caused great suspicion among the masses. In addition, village head Lu Yucheng, Farmers' Association Deputy Director Wang Yulu, and CCP village branch secretary Ma Caiyuan, among others, lost their stance during the land reform and privately accepted grain, clothing, and cloth from landlords.

　　From the above situation, the main reason for the problems in the village is that some village cadres have lost their stance and have a serious working style of being divorced from the masses, which has caused dissatisfaction among the masses. However, county and district cadres did not pay attention to the opinions of the masses and did not correctly handle the above problems.

　　In August of last year, village head Lu Yucheng, Farmers' Association Deputy Director Wang Yulu, and two others were sentenced to six months imprisonment by the county People's Court for hanging and beating Li Pi, a family member of a revolutionary soldier, while mobilizing people to repair the embankment. During their detention, Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai, former puppet Bao chiefs, took the opportunity to retaliate by organizing the masses to file complaints against village cadres Lu Yucheng and others to the district and county governments seven times in succession, taking advantage of the masses' dissatisfaction with the village cadres. (Note: In 1949, the village cadres led the masses to clear out more than 9,000 catties of grain embezzled by Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai when they were puppet Bao chiefs and lost due to unclear accounts. However, due to the impact of the famine, it has not been repaid to this day.) However, the district and county governments did not conduct investigation and research on this matter. At first, they ignored it. Finally, Wei Zhen, the CCP district committee secretary of the district, one-sidedly believed the opinions of individual village cadres and believed that Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai had instigated villagers Li Shuxuan and Wen Fubao to plot to assassinate village cadres. Without legal procedures, they arrested the above four people and sent them to the county. However, the county court detained them for three months without investigation and interrogation. After this investigation, the so-called "murder" was completely untrue.

　　The basic situation is as described above. Our handling opinions on this matter are:

　　1. Expose the erroneous facts of the village cadres and the false accusations of Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai at the mass meeting at the same time, and let the village cadres admit their mistakes and apologize to the masses at the meeting; and immediately announce the accounts of the firewood cooperative. Several main cadres have already been sentenced to six months imprisonment by the government for hanging and beating the masses, so no further administrative punishment will be given. The county party committee should still give party disciplinary sanctions to party member cadres according to the seriousness of the circumstances.

　　The 30 stone of corn embezzled by the puppet Bao chiefs Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai should still be handed over. As for the losses due to unclear accounts, they will no longer be pursued. But they must also admit their mistakes to the masses.

　　2. It was wrong for the county and district governments to detain Li Shuxuan, Wen Fubao, etc. without investigation and research, and they should make a profound self-criticism. District cadres should go to the village to admit their mistakes and apologize to the masses.

　　After the problem is handled, county and district cadres should educate village cadres to strengthen unity, stabilize the mood of the masses, and do their work well.

### 中共通县地委纪律检查委员会调查报告及处理意见

　　中共通县地委纪律检查委员会调查报告及处理意见编辑同志：
    我们接到报社转来李树成的信后，即与河北省人民法院通县专区分院及香河县的几位县、区干部，前往王店子村作了调查。李树成所反映的情况基本上是真实的。该村某些干部确有很多严重的错误行为，如村长卢玉成曾因群众隐瞒土地、拾树枝、讲怪话，前后共私罚群众玉米八千余斤。所罚的粮食虽用于该村修建学校，并非卢玉成个人贪污，但这种办法是错误的。村长卢玉成和农会主任李锡荣等，在工作中还经常打人、押人。某些村干部大吃大喝，铺张浪费的现象也是有的，如该村修建学校时，由于村干部领头吃喝浪费，盖三间校舍，就用了一万六、七千斤米。村干部在经管木柴合作社时，铺张浪费现象也很严重，其中虽无具体贪污事实，但因结束后一直未向社员群众交清账目，故引起群众很大的怀疑。另外，村长卢玉成、农会副主任王玉禄、中共村支部书记马财源等，在土地改革中失掉立场，私收地主的粮食、衣服、布匹。
    从上述情况看，该村问题发生的主要原因，是某些村干部丧失立场，有严重的脱离群众的工作作风，因而招致群众不满。县区干部却没有重视群众的意见，对上述问题加以正确的处理。
    去年八月间，该村村长卢玉成、农会副主任王玉禄等四人，因动员修堤，曾吊打革命军人家属李圮。为此，县人民法院将卢等四人判处徒刑半年。在他们被押期间，原伪保长赵祥、王德才等利用群众对村干部的不满，乘机报复，组织群众先后七次向区、县政府控告村干部卢玉成等。（按：该村干部曾于一九四九年领导群众，向赵祥、王德才清算出在当伪保长时贪污及因账目不清短少的粮食九千余斤。惟因灾荒影响，迄今未还。）但区、县政府对此不进行调查研究，初则置之不理，最后，该区中共区委书记魏珍更片面听信个别村干部的意见，认为赵祥、王德才曾主使村民李树宣、温福保，图谋暗杀村干部，不经法律手续即将上述四人逮捕送县。而县法院则将他们一直羁押三个月，未予调查审讯。经此次调查，所谓“谋杀”，全非事实。
    基本情况已如上述。我们对此事的处理意见是：
    一、将村干部错误事实及赵祥、王德才的诬告行为，同时在群众大会上揭发，让村干部在大会上向群众认错道歉；并马上公布木柴合作社的账目。几个主要干部已因吊打群众被政府判处过半年徒刑，故不再给以行政处分。对党员干部，县委仍应根据情节轻重，给以党纪制裁。
    伪保长赵祥、王德才贪污的公款三十石玉米仍应交出，至于账目不清的亏数，则不再追究。但也要向群众认错。
    二、县区政府未经调查研究即扣押李树宣、温福保等是错误的，应作深刻检讨。区干部更应到村向群众认错道歉。
    问题处理后，县区干部应教育村干部加强团结，安定群众情绪，把工作作好。
