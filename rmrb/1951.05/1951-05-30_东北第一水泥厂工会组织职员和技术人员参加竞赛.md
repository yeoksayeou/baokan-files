　　Northeast First Cement Plant Trade Union Organizes Staff and Technical Personnel to Participate in Competition
　　By our reporter Xiao Feng
　　Most of the staff and technical personnel of the Northeast First Cement Plant understand a truth, which is what they themselves said, "Isn't theory the labor experience of workers, analyzed and summarized by scientific methods?" This is the result of the plant's trade union organizing staff and technical personnel to participate in labor competitions.
　　In the labor competition before last year's National Day, most of the plant's staff and technical personnel did not participate actively. When the trade union and the administration signed the collective contract, the worker representatives from each workshop enthusiastically put forward guarantees to complete the production tasks on schedule. However, the staff and technical personnel became "bystanders" and did not say a word. At that time, there were ideological obstacles among the staff and technical personnel. There were two kinds of ideological obstacles: one was that they thought the competition had nothing to do with them. They thought that the labor competition was a matter for the workers and the trade union. They were just doing office work and using pens, and they did not have a definite production plan, so what was there to compete for? It was enough to complete the task. The other was that they found it troublesome. They thought that daily work was already busy enough, and competition would make them even busier, and maybe it would add a lot of trouble, and they might not be able to complete their work properly. When the trade union launched a patriotic labor competition in the fourth quarter, it paid attention to breaking down the above-mentioned ideological obstacles of staff and technical personnel, educating and organizing them to participate in the competition, and going to the workshops.
　　The staff and technical personnel of the Planning Section, Wage Section, and Technical Section of the plant all had the problem of being out of touch with the workshops. They formulated plans, drafted proposals, and drew drawings, mostly based on theory and subjectivity, and therefore could not be accurately applied. For example, the Planning Section formulated a cost plan based on the quantity of coal, raw materials, and materials transported into the workshop; but in reality, these things were not completely consumed immediately, and the workshop mostly had warehouses for temporary storage. In this way, the cost plan was incorrect. The Technical Section also often drew drawings that did not conform to reality. The drawing of refractory bricks for the large rotary kiln that they drew could not be used because it was not practical. After the plant's trade union found out these problems in the work of the staff and technical personnel, it used this as practical educational material to eliminate their ideological obstacles to participating in the competition and encourage them to go to the site.
　　The plant's trade union first cultivated the Planning Section as a typical example for participating in the competition. The trade union helped them study their work, find out their shortcomings, set out specific plans, and draw "work instruction diagrams" to draw the content and requirements of the week's work on the drawing board for execution and inspection. The trade union then mobilized the Planning Section to put forward conditions and challenge all sections of the plant. The trade union also helped the sections to overcome the shortcomings of formulating too many plan clauses and formulated practical and feasible conditions for improving work, and launched a competition between sections. Then, the trade union went deep into the Mechanical Workshop to help the workers summarize the problems existing between the Technical Section and the workshop as conditions for the competition and challenge the technical personnel. In the challenge letter, the workers wrote: "We guarantee to take the initiative to establish close contact with you, and we will definitely do the work according to the drawings." The technical personnel also excitedly replied to the Mechanical Workshop and put forward guarantee conditions. All the technical personnel and staff of the plant actively participated in the patriotic labor competition. At the same time, administrative leaders also assigned some technical personnel to be responsible for certain workshop technical work according to work needs. The technical personnel's sense of responsibility for their work was improved accordingly. The slogan "Go to the workshop!" has now become the actual action of the plant's staff and technical personnel.
　　After all the plant's employees participated in the patriotic labor competition, the plant's production and the work of various sections showed a new look. The plan is correct, the quota is appropriate, and labor and technology are combined. Now, the workers reflect: "This year's quota is realistic and detailed, and there are no mistakes." When workers come up with rationalization proposals, they ask the technical personnel to calculate and draw them. Wang Youdao, a worker in the manufacturing workshop, said: "When repairing machinery, we have to gesticulate several times when replacing a part; the technical personnel measure it with a ruler and draw it." The technical personnel also improved the technical equipment according to the opinions put forward by the veteran workers. Yao Xigu and Wei Changyun, technical workers in the Mechanical Workshop, created a new tool for milling helical gears on a lathe, and the technical personnel drew the drawings for them. The unity between workers and staff and technical personnel has been strengthened. When problems occur in the work, they can actively study each other and solve them in time. In the work, help each other and cooperate with each other. During the major overhaul in December last year, the Technical Section and the Mechanical Workshop established a "meeting" system. After work every day, technical personnel and workers held a joint overhaul meeting to strengthen the connection between the two sides. During the overhaul, when workers removed a machine part, the technical personnel compared the drawings, checked the current situation of the machine, and made a card record of the machine. Thanks to the joint efforts of the workers and technical personnel, the major overhaul task that originally required a month to complete was completed in fifteen days. Now, technical personnel and workers are combining theory and experience to formulate more perfect technical operating procedures and strive to improve technology and operating methods in the future.

　　东北第一水泥厂工会组织职员和技术人员参加竞赛
    本报记者  萧风
    东北第一水泥厂的职员和技术人员，大多明白了一个真理，那就是他们自己所说的，“理论还不是工人的劳动经验，用科学方法分析总结起来的？”这是该厂工会组织职员、技术人员参加劳动竞赛的结果。
    在去年国庆节以前的劳动竞赛中，该厂全体职员和技术人员大多没有动起来。工会与行政方面签订集体合同时，各车间工人代表都踊跃地提出保证，要如期完成生产任务。但职员和技术人员却成了“旁观者”，一句话也没有说。当时，在职员和技术人员中是有思想障碍的。他们的思想障碍有两种：一种是认为竞赛与己无关。他们以为劳动竞赛是工人和工会的事，自己是办事务的，耍笔杆的，没有一定的生产计划，竞赛什么呢？完成任务就行了。另一种是嫌麻烦。他们以为日常工作已经够忙了，竞赛起来会更忙，说不定会增加很多麻烦，甚至不能够好好地完成工作。工会在第四季度发起爱国主义劳动竞赛时，就注意了打破职员、技术人员的上述思想障碍，教育和组织他们参加竞赛，到车间去。
    该厂计划科、工薪科、技术科的职员和技术人员，都有和车间脱节的毛病。他们拟定计划，草拟方案，绘制图样，大多是从理论和主观出发，因而不能精确适用。比如计划科拟定成本计划，是根据石炭、原料、材料运入车间的数量计算的；但实际上，这些东西并不马上完全消耗，车间大多有仓库暂时存储。这样成本计划就不正确了。技术科绘制图样，也常常不能符合实际。他们画出的大回转窑用的耐火砖图，就因不合实际，制出砖来不能用。该厂工会找出了职员和技术人员工作中的这些问题后，就以此作为打消他们参加竞赛的思想障碍、鼓励他们到现场去的实际教育材料。
    该厂工会首先培养计划科为参加竞赛的典型。工会帮助他们研究工作，找出缺点，定出具体计划，并绘制了“工作指示图”，把一周的工作内容和要求，画到图板上去，以便执行和检查。工会然后发动计划科提出条件，向全厂各科挑战。工会并帮助各科克服了制订计划条文多的缺点，拟订出切实可行的改进工作的条件，开展了科与科的竞赛。接着，工会又深入机务车间，帮助工人把技术科与该车间存在的问题，总结出来，作为竞赛的条件，向技术人员挑战。在挑战书中，工人写明：“我们保证主动和你们取得密切联系，我们一定按图纸的规定做活。”技术人员也兴奋地答复了机务车间，并提出了保证条件。全厂技术人员和职员，都积极地参加了爱国主义劳动竞赛。同时，行政领导干部也根据工作需要，指定一些技术人员负责一定的车间技术工作。技术人员对工作的责任心随之提高。“到车间去！”的口号，现在已经成为该厂职员和技术人员的实际行动。
    全厂职工参加了爱国主义劳动竞赛后，该厂生产情况和各科工作出现了新的面貌。计划正确了，定额合适了，劳动和技术结合了。现在，工人们反映：“今年的定额又实在又细致、没啥差错了。”工人想出了合理化建议，就请技术人员算一算，画一画。制成车间的工人王有道这样说：“修理机械的时候，换个零件啥的，咱要比划好几次；技术人员用尺一量，画一下就成了。”技术人员也根据老工人提出的意见，改进技术设备。机务车间技术工人姚希古和魏昌云创造了在旋床上铣斜齿牙轮的新工具，技术人员就替他们画出了图样来。工人和职员、技术人员的团结加强了。工作中发生问题时，都能主动地互相研究，及时解决。在工作中，互相帮助，互相配合。去年十二月大检修时，技术科和机务车间建立了“碰头会”制度。每天下班后，技术人员和工人一起开一次检修碰头会，加强了双方的联系。在检修中，工人卸一个机件，技术人员就把图纸对照一下，检查一下机器的现状，做成机械的卡片记录。由于工人和技术人员的共同努力，原来需要一个月完成的大检修任务，十五天就全部完成了。现在，技术人员和工人正在把理论和经验结合起来，拟制更完善的技术操作规程，为今后提高技术、改进操作方法而努力。
