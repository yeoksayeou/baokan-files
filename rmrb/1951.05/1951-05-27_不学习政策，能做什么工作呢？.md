What kind of work can you do without studying policy?

The Chinese Communist Party Liaoning Province Liaoyang County Committee, when convening a meeting of district committee secretaries, organization members, and propaganda members on May 10, tested the 46 district committee members present. The questions were about the current central tasks and production policies. Judging from the scores of the answer sheets: 21 people scored 60 or higher, and 25 people scored below 60. Judging from the completeness of the answers to each question: The first question was what is the current central task? Only 21 people answered completely, 24 people answered incompletely, and Comrade Han Guang, the organization member of the 13th district, didn't know at all. The second question was what is the significance of signing in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty and voting against the United States arming Japan? 12 people answered completely, 24 people answered incompletely, and 1 person answered incorrectly. The third question was what is the grain requisition policy this year and what are the price ratios of various commercial grains (soybeans, rice, wheat), etc.? Only 3 people answered completely, 29 people answered incompletely, and 14 people didn't know. For example, Comrade Jiang Yonghan, the propaganda member of the 7th district, didn't answer a single word. The fourth question was how does the government reward cotton and hemp planting? No one answered completely, 31 people answered incompletely, and 15 people didn't know. Comrade Jiang Yonghan, the propaganda member of the 7th district (a cotton and hemp producing area), also didn't know at all.

What does the result of the test tell us? First of all, it sounded an alarm for the county committee's leadership - the policy education for cadres is too poor! District committee members have a very vague understanding of policies, so how can they carry out their work?

Secondly, it shows that district cadres' policy study is too poor! Many cadres often use "busy work" and "low cultural level" as excuses for not studying. Then, without studying, what skills do they rely on to do their work well? How can they improve their cultural level without studying?

Thirdly, if cadres don't know what the central task is, they will naturally blindly do whatever they encounter. If cadres are unclear about policies, they cannot explain them clearly to the masses; if the propaganda is not good, it is impossible to do the work well. If they themselves don't understand why "signing" and "voting" are being done and what goals are to be achieved, and they go to "mobilize" the masses to "sign" and "vote," what effect can that have? If the masses worry about "paying more public grain if production increases," and the propagandists don't know that "public grain is paid according to 18 percent of the land's yield level" but only shout empty slogans like "break down ideological concerns," then such propaganda will certainly be ineffective, and no wonder some people feel that "signing and voting have no effect" and that "propaganda delays production."

What do Party workers do? How do they do it? - The primary task is to continuously improve their ideological and policy level; to educate cadres and Party members with the Party's policies and ideology, and to politically improve them; to educate and influence the masses through them, and to continuously improve the masses, in order to ensure the completion of various tasks and to implement the Party's policies and ideology into various tasks. Otherwise, all kinds of bureaucratism, commandism, and red tape will follow, and the work will not be done well!

### 不学习政策，能做什么工作呢？

　　不学习政策，能做什么工作呢？
    中国共产党辽东省辽阳县委员会，在五月十日召开区委书记、组织委员、宣传委员会议时，对到会的四十六名区委委员进行了测验，题目是目前的中心工作和生产政策。从答卷分数上来看：六十分以上的二十一名，六十分以下的二十五名。从各题答的完整性来看：第一题是目前的中心工作是什么？答完整的仅二十一名，不完整的二十四名，十三区的组织委员韩光同志完全不知道。第二题是拥护缔结和平公约签名和反对美国武装日本投票的意义何在？答完整的十二名，不完整的二十四名，错误的一名。第三题是今年公粮征收政策和各种商品粮（大豆、水稻、小麦）等比价是多少？答完整的只有三名，不完整的二十九名，不知道的十四名。例如七区宣传委员姜永汉同志就一字未答。第四题是政府怎样奖励种棉麻的？答完整的一名没有，不完整的三十一名，不知道的十五名。七区（产棉麻区），宣传委员姜永汉同志竟也完全不知道。
    测验的结果告诉了我们什么呢？首先，给县委的领导上敲了警钟——对干部的政策教育太差了！区委委员们对政策的了解很模糊，怎么进行工作呢？
    其次，说明区干部的政策学习太差了！不少干部往往借口“工作忙”，“文化低”，不能学习。那么不学习依靠什么本领来把工作做好呢？不学习怎能把文化水平提高呢？
    第三，干部不知道中心工作是什么，自然就盲目地碰到什么做什么。干部对政策不明了，就不可能对群众宣传明白；宣传不好就不可能把工作做好。自己还不懂得“签名”“投票”是为什么，是要达到什么目的，而去“发动”群众“签名”“投票”，那能起什么作用呢？群众顾虑“增产了多纳公粮”，宣传的人不知道“按地级产量的百分之十八纳公粮”，而只是空喊“打破思想顾虑”，这样的宣传当然就不起作用，难怪有些人觉得“签名，投票没有作用”，“宣传耽误生产”。
    党的工作者做什么？怎么做？——首要的任务，就是要不断地提高思想政策水平；以党的政策、思想去教育干部，党员，从政治上提高他们；通过他们去教育群众、影响群众，不断地提高群众，以保证各种工作的完成，并把党的政策、思想贯彻到各种工作中去。否则，一切的事务主义，命令主义，官僚主义就都会随之而来，工作是做不好的！
