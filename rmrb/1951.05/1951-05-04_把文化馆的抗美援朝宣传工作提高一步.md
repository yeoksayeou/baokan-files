To the Editor:

Since the General Association of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement called for vigorous development of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement, doing a good job in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda work has become the central task of cultural centers across the country. Cultural centers in various places have indeed invested a lot of effort and achieved considerable results in carrying out propaganda work for this movement. However, because we have failed to regularly check the propaganda effect, and are only satisfied with the achievements we have already made, the work cannot be gradually improved. Now, based on the work of several cultural centers in Beijing, I would like to put forward some suggestions.

First of all, the working cadres of the cultural centers should improve their understanding ideologically. Some cultural center working cadres believe that everything that should be publicized has already been publicized, so what else is there to talk about? Some cadres do not use their brains and just wait for the higher authorities to assign them work. Judging from these ideological situations, our cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the long-term nature of Anti-American and Aid-Korea patriotic education; nor are they good at combining the central tasks of each period or the specific ideological situation of the masses to carry out propaganda work, but isolate the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement. In fact, this idea is wrong. With the changes in the objective situation, the masses' thinking will change at any time and new problems will arise. For example, after the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to withdraw from Seoul, some people's thinking fluctuated. This shows that their "fear of America" ideology has not been completely resolved; we still need to carry out more propaganda and education work targeting their ideological situation.

Secondly, we should check our work from the perspective of propaganda effect. Some comrades only blindly and formalistically pursue numbers, such as how many lectures, how many exhibitions, how many listeners or viewers were held, and rarely investigate what problems have been solved for the masses after the propaganda, and what work should be carried out in the future. This kind of perfunctory formalism must be corrected.

In terms of propaganda methods and approaches, we should, based on the existing conditions, hold more small-scale lectures, evening parties, and exhibitions. The content must be focused and prominent. In this way, not only will it be easier for the masses to accept, but it will also be easier to measure the work effect. In addition, we can also adopt more visualized propaganda methods that are popular with the masses, such as short plays, cartoons, models, and window posters.

If we can further summarize past experiences and pay attention to the propaganda effect, the work of the cultural centers will continue to improve, and we will be able to better complete the propaganda tasks of Anti-American and Aid-Korea patriotic education.

### 把文化馆的抗美援朝宣传工作提高一步

    把文化馆的抗美援朝宣传工作提高一步编辑同志：
    自从中国人民抗美援朝总会号召大力开展抗美援朝运动以来，搞好抗美援朝宣传工作已成为全国各地文化馆的中心任务。各地文化馆在开展这一运动的宣传工作上，确已投入了很大的力量，获得了不少的成绩。但是，因为我们未能经常检查宣传效果，仅仅满足于已得的成绩，以致工作不能逐步提高。现在，我根据北京市几个文化馆的工作情况，提出一些意见。
    首先，文化馆的工作干部应从自己的思想上提高认识。有的文化馆工作干部认为应该宣传的都宣传过了，再讲些什么呢？有的干部不动脑筋，光是等待上级为他布置工作。从这些思想情况看来，我们的干部对抗美援朝爱国主义教育的长期性认识不足；也不善于结合每个时期的中心任务或群众的具体思想情况来进行宣传工作，而将抗美援朝运动孤立起来。其实，这种想法是不对的。随着客观形势的变化，群众的思想随时会出现新的问题。譬如：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军主动撤出汉城后，有些群众的思想就起了波动。这就说明他们的“恐美”思想还没有彻底解决；还需要我们针对他们的思想情况作更多的宣传教育工作。
    其次，应该从宣传效果上来检查我们的工作。有的同志只是盲目地、形式主义地追求数字，如举办了几次讲座、几次展览会、有多少听众或观众，很少去调查经过宣传给群众解决了些什么问题，以后还应该进行些什么工作。这种交差了事的形式主义作风是必须纠正的。
    在宣传方式和方法上，我们应根据现有的条件多举办小型的讲座、晚会、展览会。内容必须是集中的、突出的。这样，不仅使群众易于接受，同时也容易测验工作效果。此外，我们还可以多采用为群众所喜欢的形象化的宣传，如短剧、漫画、模型、橱窗宣传画等。
    如果我们能进一步地总结过去的经验，注意宣传效果，文化馆的工作是会不断地提高，并且能更好地完成抗美援朝爱国主义教育的宣传任务。
