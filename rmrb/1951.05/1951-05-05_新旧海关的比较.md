　　Comparison of the Old and New Customs
　　Ding Guitang, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government
　　I served in the old customs for thirty-four years until the liberation of Shanghai. Due to my personal experience and what I have seen and heard, I know the crimes of imperialism in ruling the old customs in detail. If I were to fully expose them, I am afraid that even writing a large book would not be enough. Now that the State Council of our Central People's Government has ordered the promulgation of the first nationwide unified provisional customs law in the history of our country, I would like to take this opportunity to compare the main and fundamental differences between the new and old customs, in order to expose the prominent evils of imperialism in the old customs, so that our people across the country can more clearly recognize that the old customs was a tool of imperialist economic aggression, an organ for the reactionary ruling class to exploit the people, and should be hated and resolutely opposed; at the same time, we should clearly recognize that the new customs is the people's own customs, serving the interests of the people, and should be cherished and supported.

　First, the administrative power of the customs
　　From 1854 to the nationwide liberation of mainland China in 1949, China's customs had always been ruled by foreign Inspector Generals representing imperialism. In the hundred years of history, although there have been many revolutions and political changes, not only has it failed to weaken the imperialist rule in the old customs, but it has gradually increased and consolidated their privileges. For example, the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858 stipulated that foreigners should be employed in the customs, consolidating their position in the old customs. The Boxer Protocol in 1901 stipulated that customs duties should be used as a guarantee for indemnity, increasing their plunder in the old customs. In 1912, the Qing government allowed the "Inspector General" to control the foreign debt indemnity fund, obtaining the right to keep custody of customs duties and surpluses. After the failure of the Great Revolution, in 1929, the reactionary government approved the establishment of a maritime anti-smuggling fleet and a land customs police force in the old customs, enabling imperialism to further encroach on China's right to patrol the national border. As for all the administrative sovereignty of the old customs, it was all in the hands of the imperialist groups and their agent, the "Inspector General." For example, the decrees and regulations issued by the reactionary government could not be implemented by local customs without the instructions of the "Inspector General"; the "Inspector General" ignored Chinese laws altogether without the consent of the then so-called diplomatic corps. Therefore, although the old customs was nominally a Chinese institution, it was no less than an independent kingdom of imperialism within China. In the past, the Tax Department of the reactionary government and the Customs Administration of the puppet Ministry of Finance not only could not supervise and direct the successive "Inspectors General," but instead flattered and obeyed them.

　　After liberation, imperialism has been fundamentally driven out of the customs. The foreign personnel who originally served in the old customs have been dismissed, except for a very few technical personnel who are temporarily retained. Our new customs is a truly independent and autonomous state institution, handling customs business in accordance with the Common Program and the country's foreign trade policy, thoroughly implementing the laws of the Central People's Government, and shouldering the responsibility of protecting national production, changing the nature of the old customs serving imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and turning it into a new customs serving the interests of the broad masses of the people. In the era of the old customs, the "Inspector General" frequently propagandized and repeatedly warned that the customs would not be well managed without the participation of foreigners; he repeatedly suggested to the reactionary government to recruit foreign youths into the customs in order to inherit their dream of a career lasting ten thousand generations. But the new customs in the past year is entirely run by our own Chinese people. Not only is it not badly managed, but it is managed better than in the era of foreign rule. This has shattered the shameless slander and conspiracy of imperialism.

　Second, the customs regulations
　　Although the old customs has a history of one hundred years, it has never had a written customs law. All business was handled entirely in accordance with the provisions of unequal treaties or unilateral agreements. All laws and regulations were also "edicts" and "circulars" issued by the "Inspector General" according to his own wishes, and all were in English. These "edicts" and "circulars" were not allowed to be read by ordinary Chinese customs officers. This was their vicious means of consolidating their rule, "to make the people do as they are told, but not to let them know why." As for the general import and export merchants and people, the customs regulations were even more unpredictable. When they mistakenly violated customs regulations, they had to submit to the arbitrary disposal of foreigners.

　　The newly promulgated Provisional Customs Law clearly stipulates the organization, functions and tasks of the customs, the relationship between the customs and various parties, the laws and regulations that the people should abide by, and the people's right to appeal; at the same time, it abolishes all past methods that were beneficial to foreign merchants and unfavorable to the Chinese people. From now on, customs employees will have a basis to follow and handle affairs in accordance with the regulations, and general import and export merchants and people will also have something to follow.

　Third, the tasks of the customs
　　The old customs was characterized by great customs chauvinism and handled many things that should not have been under its control. For example, in the Qing Dynasty, the "Inspector General" acted as agent for schools (language schools, civil service schools), acted as agent for foreign affairs, acted as agent for foreign loans, acted as agent for international exhibitions, acted as agent for international agreements, acted as agent for postal services, acted as agent for debt repayment and indemnity, acted as agent for sea and river port affairs, acted as agent for meteorological measurements, acted as agent for port and river management, acted as agent for pilots, and attempted to act as agent for the national land tax. After the 1911 Revolution, the "Inspector General" again acted as agent for the custody of customs duties and surpluses, acted as agent for the national customs offices within fifty li of the national customs, acted as agent for the reorganization of domestic public debt, acted as agent for the distribution of diplomatic and consular expenses and military and police salaries, and used customs duties as collateral for the 1914 Reorganization Loan, attempting to act as agent for the national salt administration. In 1929, the old customs established a maritime anti-smuggling fleet and a land customs police force, acting as our agent for patrolling the national border. On the eve of liberation, the old customs was still acting as agent for seaport and river affairs and patrolling the coastal border. The above-mentioned duties undertaken by the "Inspector General" seemed on the surface to have done many things for our country, but in essence, they were used to expand the aggressive forces of imperialism and strengthen their privileges in China's customs; making them like imperialist viceroys stationed in colonial countries.

　　According to the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on customs work on January 27, 1950, the main tasks of the new customs are to supervise and manage import and export goods, collect customs duties, and investigate and prohibit smuggling. As for duties unrelated to the customs, such as maritime affairs, river affairs, port affairs, patrolling the national border and coastline, and anti-smuggling work outside the customs, they are transferred to the transportation or public security departments separately, in order to clarify functions and responsibilities.

　Fourth, the customs tariff
　　The customs tariff and tax rates of the old customs completely lost their autonomy after the Qing Dynasty was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing in 1843; although they were repeatedly revised in the form of agreements before 1929, the tax rates were still limited to 5% of the value of the goods. After 1929, although autonomy was nominally obtained, there were still many restrictions in practice, and internationally reduced tax rates still existed until the eve of liberation. In short, for more than a hundred years before liberation, China's customs duties never achieved true and complete autonomy. Capitalist countries used our extremely low customs duties to import foreign goods in large quantities and plunder our raw materials; although customs duties were raised after 1929, they were entirely for the purpose of revenue and did not play a role in protecting domestic production. Foreign goods could still be dumped on our market in large quantities, and domestic industrial products could not compete with them. In the seventy-three years before liberation, China's foreign trade had a large deficit every year, and the imported goods were mostly luxury goods, consumer goods, food, and non-essential goods, which squeezed out our industry and agriculture, and drained the blood of our people, so that our people's economy was on the verge of bankruptcy before liberation.

　　After liberation, although we temporarily adopted the old tariff of 1948, the tax rates have been partially adjusted according to the national economic situation and domestic needs, so that they are more suitable for the requirements of developing domestic production and protecting domestic industry; at the same time, due to the implementation of the foreign trade control policy, we allow and encourage the import of what we need, and we do not allow the import of what we do not need. Therefore, in the 1950 statistics on China's foreign trade, the previous records have been broken and a surplus has appeared for the first time in seventy-three years. There has also been a fundamental change in the types of imported goods, most of which are urgently needed machinery, industrial raw materials, industrial equipment, and daily necessities that China cannot produce or produces very little. As for food, not only is there no import, but there is already an export.

　Fifth, the principle of establishing customs offices
　　The locations of the old customs offices were all to facilitate imperialist economic aggression, and according to unequal treaties and unilateral agreements, China was forced to open coastal and river ports for foreign trade. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were forty-five independent customs offices and two hundred and fifty branch offices throughout the country. Inland areas such as Chongqing, Wanxian, Shashi, and Yichang also had customs offices, creating a situation where customs checkpoints were everywhere in the inland and the doors and windows were wide open along the coast and border.

　　After the establishment of the new customs, the principle of establishing customs offices was re-stipulated according to the foreign trade policy and the needs of the national economic situation. The country was adjusted to twenty-six independent customs offices and forty-four branch offices; all ports that were not needed for our foreign trade and national economic situation were closed and the customs offices were abolished, and manpower and resources were concentrated to strengthen the control of foreign trade in open ports in order to consolidate China's economic defense.

　Sixth, the customs expenses
　　The expenses of the old customs were originally based on a contracted system, that is, a portion was deducted from the annual customs revenue, together with the collected ship taxes, fees, fines, and confiscated smuggled goods sold, as customs expenses. Since 1929, although the then so-called National Treasury Law has been implemented and annual budgets have been prepared, the "Inspector General" has the right to deduct expenses from customs revenue at any time, so that the final accounts often exceed the budget by two or three times, and the reactionary government has no choice but to approve the additional expenses afterwards. Before liberation, the expenses of the old customs accounted for about 20% of its revenue. After liberation, due to the implementation of streamlining and economy, the expenses of the new customs throughout the country in 1950 accounted for only 2.5% of the total customs revenue.

　Seventh, the customs personnel
　　The personnel management system of the old customs was entirely a set of fierce, cunning, and vicious methods of imperialism ruling colonies. For example, customs officers were divided into internal and external classes: the internal class was divided into twenty-seven levels, such as Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners, and Customs Officers; the external class was divided into sixteen levels, such as Superintendents, Inspectors, Examiners, Appraisers, and Cargo Inspectors, in order to divide the customs officers. The performance appraisal of customs officers was entirely based on the confidential reports of supervisors, and a system of annual promotion was stipulated in order to enslave customs officers. As a result, it caused most Chinese customs officers to be generally disunited, without vigor, and even fostered a tendency to flatter foreigners and lack national consciousness and patriotic thought. Although there were progressive elements among the customs officers, they were mostly oppressed by foreigners and could not develop.

　　The number of foreign personnel in the old customs reached a record high of 1,448 at the most. In 1948, there were still 234 foreign employees in the national customs. In addition to the "Inspector General" always being filled by foreigners, the Commissioners of other customs offices and the main responsible persons of various departments were mostly foreigners. Chinese customs officers could only be responsible for general administrative or even servile duties. As for the treatment of foreigners, in addition to special preferential treatment, their monthly salaries and pensions at retirement were calculated in pounds or US dollars. More than half of the annual expenses of the old customs were spent on foreigners. Taking the "Inspector General" alone, the garden house he lived in, the cars, furniture, servants, and entertainment expenses he used were all supplied by the customs. In addition, he received a monthly salary of 1,000 pounds, which, calculated at 16 silver dollars per pound and then at the purchasing power of silver dollars at the time, was about 3.8 billion yuan per year, exceeding the total annual salary of all cadres of the new General Administration of Customs in 1950 by about 1.6 billion yuan, or equal to more than 160 times the current annual salary of the Director of the General Administration of Customs.

　　The personnel system of the new customs has abolished many unreasonable methods and special high-salary treatments of the old customs era, and appoints cadres based on both virtue and talent, in order to make the best use of their talents. As for the evaluation of cadres' salaries and allowances, a combination of democratic evaluation and administrative review is adopted, in order to achieve the goal of correctness and fairness through the masses. At present, the number of customs employees throughout the country has been greatly streamlined compared to the eve of liberation. In terms of expenditure, the General Administration of Customs spent a total of more than 3.9 billion yuan in 1950, while the annual expenditure of the "Inspector General" in the past (calculated according to the number of silver dollars spent in 1937) was about 47 billion yuan, a world of difference.

　　All of the above reforms have enabled the old customs, which had been ruled by imperialism for many years, served imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and exploited the masses of the people, to be fundamentally reversed in a year and become a new, independent and autonomous customs serving the masses of the people. This is entirely due to the great victory of the people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao. Otherwise, not only would the Chinese customs still not be able to get rid of imperialist rule, but the country and nation would also perish. Therefore, all our customs employees should sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, follow them forever, and wholeheartedly work hard in the new customs to serve the people.

　　新旧海关的比较
    中央人民政府海关总署副署长  丁贵堂
    我在旧海关中服务，至上海解放时已有三十四年之久；由于亲身经历和目睹耳闻，对于帝国主义统治旧海关的罪行，知之较为详细，如尽情揭露，即写成一大本书亦恐写不完说不尽。现值我中央人民政府政务院命令公布我国海关有史以来第一部全国统一的暂行海关法，特愿乘此机会对新旧海关主要的基本的不同，作一比较，借以揭露帝国主义在旧海关显著的罪恶，使我全国人民更清楚地认识旧海关是帝国主义经济侵略的工具，是反动统治阶级剥削人民的机关，是应当厌恶与坚决反对的；同时也明确地认识新海关是人民自己的海关，是为人民利益服务的，是应当爱护与支持的。
  第一、海关的行政权
    自一八五四年起至一九四九年全国大陆解放时止，我国海关始终为帝国主义的代表外籍总税务司统治着。在一百年来的历史中，虽经过多次革命和政治变迁，不但未能削弱帝国主义在旧海关的统治，反而逐渐增加和巩固了它们的特权。如一八五八年的天津条约规定海关任用外人，巩固了它们在旧海关的地位，一九○一年的庚子和约规定关税为赔款的担保，增加了它们在旧海关的掠夺；一九一二年满清允许“总税务司”掌握外债赔款的基金，取得了关税及关余的保管权；大革命失败后一九二九年反动政府核准旧海关建立海上缉私舰队及陆上关警队，使帝国主义更侵占了我国巡卫国境权。至于旧海关的一切行政主权，也无一不操于帝国主义集团和它们代理人“总税务司”的手里。如反动政府发布的法令规章，各地海关未得“总税务司”指示之前不能执行；“总税务司”未得当时所谓外交团的同意，则对中国法令一概置之不理。所以旧海关虽名为我国的机关，实不啻帝国主义在我国内的独立王国。以前反动政府的税务处及伪财政部的关务署，对历任“总税务司”非仅不能监督指挥，反而谄媚奉承唯命是从。
    解放后，帝国主义已由海关中根本的赶出去了，原在旧海关服务的洋员除极少数技术人员暂予留用外，均已解职。我们的新海关是真正独立自主的国家机构，依据共同纲领及国家对外贸易政策办理海关业务，彻底执行中央人民政府的法令，负起了保护国家生产的责任，改变了旧海关为帝国主义及官僚资本主义服务的本质，变成了为广大人民利益服务的新海关。在旧海关时代，“总税务司”经常宣传并再三警告：海关如无外人参加不会办好；迭次向反动政府建议广招外国青年进关，以继承它们梦想的万世之业。但一年来的新海关是完全由我们中国人民自己办的，非止办得不坏，且比外人统治时代办得好，这就粉碎了帝国主义无耻的谰言和阴谋。
  第二、海关的法规
    旧海关虽有百年历史，但向无成文的海关法，一切业务完全依照不平等条约或片面协定条款办理，所有法令规章亦均是“总税务司”按照自己的意思发出的“手谕”和“通令”，且均用英文。这些“手谕”“通令”，一般的中国关员不得阅看。这是它们“只可使由之不可使知之”的巩固统治的毒辣手段。至于一般进出口商民对于海关的规章更属莫测高深，误犯关章时只有听凭外人的任意处分。
    新颁布的暂行海关法，明确规定了海关的组织、职权和任务，海关与各方面的关系，人民应遵守的法令与规章以及人民的申诉权利；同时废除了以往一切有益于洋商不利于国人的办法；今后海关员工既有所依据得按章办事，而一般进出口商民也有所遵循。
  第三、海关的任务
    旧海关是大海关主义，许多不应管的事也包揽在自己手中。如在满清时代，“总税务司”曾代办学校（方言馆、仕学馆）、代办外交，代借外债，代办国际展览，代订国际协定，代办邮政，代办偿债赔款，代办海江港务，代办气象测量，代办治港治河、代办引水，并企图代办全国地亩税。辛亥革命后“总税务司”又代保管关税及关余，代管全国海关五十里以内的钞关，代为整理国内公债，代为发放外交使领经费及军警薪饷，并将关税作为一九一四年善后大借款的抵押，企图代管全国盐务。一九二九年旧海关建立海上缉私舰队及陆上关警队，代我巡防国境。解放前夕，旧海关仍代管海港江务和代巡沿海边疆。“总税务司”代办的以上职务，表面上似为我国办了许多事，而实质上是借之以扩大帝国主义的侵略势力，加强他们在我国海关中的特权；使他们一如帝国主义派驻在殖民地国家里的钦差大臣一样。
    依据一九五○年一月二十七日中央人民政府政务院关于海关工作的决定，新海关的主要任务为监管进出口物品，征收关税，和查禁走私。至于与海关无关的职务如海务、江务、港务、巡卫国境海岸，及海关以外的查私工作等，分别的移交于交通或公安部门，以明职权而专责成。
  第四、海关的税则
    旧海关的税则税率，自一八四三年满清被迫签订南京条约后完全失掉了自主；一九二九年前虽迭经协定式的修改，而税率仍限制为货值的百分之五。一九二九年后名义上虽获得自主，实际上仍有多少的限制，直至解放前夕尚存在着国际减让的税率。总之解放以前百余年中，我国关税始终未得到真正的完全自主。资本主义国家利用我极低关税大量输入洋货，掠夺我国原料；一九二九年起关税税率虽较提高，但完全以税收为目的，并未起保护本国生产的作用，洋货仍得在我市场上大量倾销，国内工业产品不能与之竞争。解放前七十三年内，我国对外贸易每年都是大量的入超，且进口的货物多属奢侈品、消耗品、食粮，及非必需品，挤垮了我国的工业和农业，吸干了我国人民的血液，以致我国人民经济在解放前已濒于破产了。
    解放后我们虽暂采用一九四八年的旧税则，而税率已根据国家经济情况和国内需要部分予以调整，使其较能适合于发展国内生产保护国内工业的要求；同时由于实行了对外贸易管制政策，凡我需要的准许并鼓励它进口，凡我不需要的不准它进口。因此在一九五○年我国对外贸易统计上已打破了以往的纪录，出现了七十三年来未有的出超。进口货物种类也有了根本的改变，其中多属我国急需的机械，工业原料，工业器材，以及我国不能或极少生产的民生日用必需品，至食粮一项不但没有进口而且已有了出口。
  第五、设关的原则
    旧海关的设关地点，都是为便利帝国主义的经济侵略，根据不平等条约及片面协定，强迫我国开放对外贸易沿海沿江的口岸。抗日战争以前，全国共有四十五个独立关和二百五十个分支关所，内地如重庆、万县、沙市、宜昌等亦均设有海关，造成内地关卡林立沿海沿边门户洞开的现象。
    新海关建立后，根据对外贸易政策及国家经济情况需要，重行规定了设关原则，全国调整为二十六个独立关及四十四个分支机构；凡为我对外贸易及国家经济情况不需要的口岸，均行封闭并撤销海关机构，集中人力物力，在开放口岸加强对外贸易的管制，以巩固我国经济国防。
  第六、海关的经费
    旧海关的经费原为包干制，即每年由关税收入中扣留一部分，连同所征船钞、规费、罚款、暨没收私货变价等作为海关经费。自一九二九年起虽已实行当时所谓的国库法，每年编造预算，但因“总税务司”有权随时由关税税款内扣支，以致决算时常超出预算的二三倍，反动政府亦只得准予事后追加。解放前旧海关的经费约占其税收的百分之二十。解放后因实施精简节约，一九五○年全国新海关的经费仅占关税总收入百分之二·五。
  第七、海关的人事
    旧海关的人事管理制度，完全是帝国主义统治殖民地的一套凶恶狡猾毒辣的办法。如划分关员为内外班：内班分税务司、帮办、税务员等二十七级；外班分监察长、监察员、稽查员、验估员、验货员等十六级，以分化关员。关员的考绩全凭主管人员个人的密报，并规定按年资升级的制度，以奴化关员。因之就造成了我国关员除少数外一般地不团结、无朝气，甚至养成了媚外风气，缺乏民族意识和爱国思想。关员中虽有进步分子，但多遭受外人压迫、不得发展。
    旧海关外籍人员，最多时曾达一千四百四十八人的纪录，至一九四八年全国海关尚有外籍职员二百三十四人，除“总税务司”始终由外人充任外，其余各关的税务司及各部门主要负责人大半都是外人，我国关员仅能担任一般事务性甚至带有奴役性的职务。至于外人的待遇，除规定特别优厚以外，每月薪资及退休时的养老金还均以英镑或美金计算。旧海关每年经费的二分之一以上，都花费在外人的身上，仅就“总税务司”一人而论，它所住的花园洋房，所用的汽车、家具、佣人、及交际费等均由海关供给，另外每月支领薪金一千英镑，按每镑合银元十六元再按当时银元购买力计算，全年约合人民币三十八亿余元，超过新的海关总署全体干部一九五○年的全年工资约十六亿余元，或等于现时海关总署署长所支的年薪的一百六十多倍。
    新海关的人事制度，已将旧海关时代许多不合理的办法及特殊的高薪待遇予以废除，任用干部以德才为标准，以期人尽其才，才尽其用。至于干部薪津的评定，采取民主评议行政审查相结合的方式，以期通过群众达到正确公平的目的。现时全国海关员工较解放前夕已大为精简。经费支出方面，一九五○年海关总署共支出人民币三十九亿余元，而“总税务司”署过去全年支出（按一九三七年度支出的银元数计算）约合人民币四百七十余亿元，两相比较，天壤悬殊。
    所有以上种种改革，使多年为帝国主义统治、为帝国主义及官僚资本主义服务、剥削人民大众的旧海关，能于一年期间根本的扭转过来，变为独立自主为人民大众服务的新海关，这完全是由于以毛主席为首的中国共产党领导的人民革命的伟大胜利得来的，不然的话，非止中国海关仍不能摆脱帝国主义的统治，且恐国家和民族亦将沦亡了。所以我们海关全体员工，应当衷心的感谢毛主席和中国共产党，永远的跟着他们走，并全心全意的在新海关努力工作为人民服务。
