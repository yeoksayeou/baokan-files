To the Editor:

　　I used to attend middle school in Shandong. At that time, the Japanese puppet rulers and the Kuomintang reactionaries revered Wu Xun as the "Beggar Saint," and along with the so-called "Sage Confucius" and "Second Sage Mencius," they were collectively known as the "Four Saints" of Shandong. They used "Shandong as the land of saints and sages" to deceive young people, demanding that young students learn from the "Four Saints," especially to learn to be submissive people to the reactionary ruling class like Wu Xun.

　　For example, in 1946, under the crazy exploitation and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, many students in Qufu were forced to drop out of school. As a result, young students launched the "anti-hunger" movement, marching and demonstrating one after another. The Kuomintang reactionaries then used the "Wu Xun spirit" to numb the youth, saying: "Young people must work hard to seek their own future. As long as you do something like Wu Xun's begging for alms to establish schools, you will naturally find a way out in society!"

　　For another example, in 1944, during the Japanese puppet rule, Chaocheng Middle School was dissolved by the Japanese puppet government. Many students were displaced, homeless, and asked the then enemy puppet government to find a way to resettle them. The enemy puppet rulers said: "The youth of Chaocheng should become the second Wu Xun, starting from scratch, and establishing Wu Xun's immortal achievements."

　　From the above two events, we can clearly see that the "Wu Xun spirit" is a spirit of faithfully serving the reactionary rulers, a spirit of wagging one's tail and begging for mercy from the reactionary rulers, and not a spirit of educating young people to embark on the road of revolution. Therefore, such a character as Wu Xun is definitely not someone we should praise.

### 从我经历的两件事来看所谓“武训精神”

　　从我经历的两件事来看所谓“武训精神”编辑同志：
    我过去曾在山东上中学。那时，日伪统治者和国民党反动派都把武训尊为“丐圣”，和所谓“至圣孔子”、“亚圣孟子”等并称为山东“四圣”。他们以“山东为圣贤之地”来迷惑青年，要求青年学生向“四圣”学习，特别是学习像武训那样做反动统治阶级的顺民。
    例如：一九四六年，在国民党反动统治者疯狂的剥削和压迫下，曲阜很多学生被迫失学。于是，青年学生们掀起了“反饥饿”运动，纷纷游行示威，国民党反动派便利用“武训精神”来麻醉青年说：“青年们要自己努力自求前途。只要做出像武训那样行乞兴学的事业来，在社会上便自会有出路的！”
    再如：一九四四年日伪统治时，朝城中学被日伪政府解散。很多学生们流离失所，无家可归，便要求当时敌伪政府设法安置。而敌伪统治者说：“朝城青年要做第二个武训，要白手起家，立武训那样的不朽之功。”
    从以上两件事里，我们可以清清楚楚地看到：“武训精神”是忠实为反动统治者效劳的精神，是向反动统治者摇尾乞怜的精神，而不是教育青年走上革命之路的精神。因之，武训这样的人物决不是我们所应歌颂的。
