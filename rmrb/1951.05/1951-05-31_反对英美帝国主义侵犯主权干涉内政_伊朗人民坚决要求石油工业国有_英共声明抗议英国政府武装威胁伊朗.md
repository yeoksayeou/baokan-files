Xinhua News Agency: The people of Tehran, the capital of Iran, held a mass rally on May 22nd in Beharistan Square, opposite the parliament, to support the nationalization of the oil industry and the abolition of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Nearly 30,000 people participated in the rally. Prominent religious leader Kashani and parliamentarians Maki and Bagai, among others, delivered speeches at the meeting.

The speeches and resolutions passed at the rally demonstrated the Iranian people's will to unconditionally recover the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and nationalize it. The resolution advocated rejecting the British note that undermined Iranian sovereignty and interfered in Iran's internal affairs. The resolution emphasized that the Iranian lower and upper houses have the right, according to the United Nations Charter, to implement the decision to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, and the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should abide by this decision. The resolution also pointed out that rumors of British troops being sent to Iran led the Iranian people to believe that any such action by Britain would be a "barbaric act of aggression and a violation of Iran's sovereignty and independence." The resolution also protested against the statement issued by the US government on the Iranian oil issue, considering it an open interference in Iran's internal affairs.

The resolution of the rally called on the Iranian people to "unite selflessly and work together to prevent any act of aggression against Iran."

Xinhua News Agency, dated 28th: TASS quoted Tehran Radio as broadcasting that some foreign journalists, at the invitation of Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh, and accompanied by Tehran Municipal Council Chairman Mehran and lower house member Maki, visited the southern district of Tehran on May 21st. The living conditions of the residents in this area are extremely miserable. Their houses are merely cellars covered with a layer of something and with a few air holes. In one cellar, 120 people lived. Tehran Radio pointed out that when the journalists were invited to see another cellar housing 240 people, they simply could not believe their own eyes, because the scene was so terrible. The water in that area was black and absolutely undrinkable. There were no sanitary facilities there. The journalists were attacked by swarms of flies.

Near one such cellar, Payami, a resident of the area, told reporters that most of the working people of Tehran were crowded into these very bad cellars, exchanging their blood and sweat for bread. He said: These workers do not want the wealth of the Iranian people to fall into the hands of foreigners. The people living in the cellars do not even have the most basic living conditions. They demand to improve their lives. They demand the recovery of the rich oil seized by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

Xinhua News Agency: The Iranian Minister of Finance, on behalf of the Iranian government, sent a letter to "Mr. Seton, the representative of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company," who is currently in Tehran. In this letter, the Iranian Minister of Finance said that he "awaits the representatives of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at the Ministry of Finance every day." He also said that if these representatives have not come to the Ministry of Finance by May 30th (including this day), "the government will be forced" to abide by the laws regarding nationalization of the oil industry and "fulfill its legal responsibilities."

Xinhua News Agency: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 24th, protesting the British Labour government's threat of military intervention in Iran.

The statement said: British gunboats have been deployed to the Persian Gulf. Soldiers of the British 16th Independent Parachute Brigade have received tropical equipment and are preparing to depart at the weekend. This method of imperialists intimidating weak countries for the benefit of large oil companies cannot withstand any criticism. The claims by British diplomats to "legitimate rights" stipulated in the 1933 treaty are completely unreasonable, because the 1933 treaty was also forced upon the Iranian government through the same gunboat diplomacy.

The statement emphasized that the Iranian government has the right to nationalize its oil industry whenever it wishes. The statement said: "No country has the right to interfere in Iran's internal affairs." The statement pointed out that US imperialism is trying to use the current situation to expand its control over Iranian oil. Both US and British imperialism are equally opposed to the interests of the Iranian people. The Iranian people want to fully own and operate their own resources.

The statement said: The powerful mass movement of the Iranian people, as demonstrated by the oil workers' strike, is in response to the peace movement and the massive demonstrations organized by the Tudeh Party. It shows the Iranian people's united determination to get rid of imperialist shackles and fight for freedom. US and British imperialists are trying to turn Iran into a base for an anti-Soviet war. They intend to turn Iran into a second Korea.

The statement concluded by calling on the British labour movement and democratic public opinion to immediately mobilize and actively protest, not to allow a single soldier to be sent to Iran. The statement pointed out: This military adventure is a major provocation; and will sacrifice the lives of British people for the imperialist policies of oil monopolies.

　　反对英美帝国主义侵犯主权干涉内政
    伊朗人民坚决要求石油工业国有
    英共声明抗议英国政府武装威胁伊朗
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：伊朗首都德黑兰的人民，于五月二十二日在议会对面的贝哈利斯坦广场举行群众大会，拥护石油工业国有化与取消英伊石油公司。参加大会的有将近三万人。有名的宗教领袖卡沙尼、议员马基与巴加伊等人都在会上发表了演说。
    在大会上发表的演说与通过的决议，表现了伊朗人民要求把英伊石油公司无条件收回国有的意志。决议主张拒绝破坏伊朗人民主权与干涉伊朗内政的英国照会。决议着重指出，伊朗下院与上院根据联合国宪章，有权执行伊朗石油工业国有化的决定，前英伊石油公司应该服从这项决定。决议又指出，传闻英国要出兵伊朗，伊朗人民认为：英国的任何这种行动都是“野蛮的侵略行为与对伊朗主权和独立的侵犯”。决议同时抗议美国政府对伊朗石油问题所发表的声明，认为该项声明是对伊朗内政的公开干涉。
    大会的决议号召伊朗人民“忘我地团结起来，同心协力，阻止任何侵略伊朗的行为。”
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社引德黑兰电台广播：一些外国记者应伊朗首相摩萨台的邀请，由德黑兰市政会议主席梅赫兰和下院议员马基陪同，于五月二十一日访问了德黑兰的南区。该区居民的生活条件，极为凄惨。他们的房子仅仅是上面盖着一层东西、开了几个出气洞的地窖。在某一地窖里，居住着一百二十人。德黑兰电台指出：当记者们被邀去看另一个住有二百四十人的地窖时，他们简直不相信他们自己的眼睛，因为景象实在太可怕了。该区的水是黑色的，绝对喝不得。那里没有任何卫生设备。记者们受到成群的苍蝇的袭击。
    在一个这样的地窖附近，该区居民帕亚米告诉记者们说：大多数德黑兰劳动人民都拥挤在这些非常坏的地窖中，以他们的血汗换取面包。他说：这些工人们不愿意伊朗人民的财富落入外国人的手中。住在地窖中的人民连最基本的生存条件都没有。他们要求改善他们的生活。他们要求收回被英伊石油公司所夺去的丰富的石油。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：伊朗财政大臣代表伊朗政府致函目前在德黑兰的“前英伊石油公司的代表塞顿先生”。伊朗财政大臣在这封信里说：他“每日在财政部等待前英伊石油公司的代表”。他并说：如果这些代表们到五月三十日（这一天也算在内）还没有来财政部，“政府将被迫”遵照石油工业国有化法律，“履行它的法律责任”。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：英国共产党政治委员会于二十四日发表声明，抗议英国工党政府以军事干涉威胁伊朗。
    声明称：英国炮舰已经调到波斯湾。英国伞兵第十六独立旅的士兵已领到了在热带用的配备，准备在周末出发。帝国主义者为了大石油公司的利益而恫吓软弱国家的这种方法，是经不起任何批评的。英国外交人员对一九三三年条约所规定的“合法权利”的要求是完全无理的，因为一九三三年的条约也是用同样的炮舰外交强迫伊朗政府接受的。
    声明强调伊朗政府有权在它愿意的时候将其石油工业收归国有。声明说：“任何国家都没有权利干涉伊朗的内政。”声明指出：美帝国主义正在设法利用现在的形式来扩大它对伊朗石油的控制。美、英两帝国主义同样地反对着伊朗人民的利益。伊朗人民要使自己的资源完全为自己所有而且由自己经营。
    声明说：石油工人罢工中所表现的伊朗人民的强大群众运动，是响应和平运动和群众党所组织的巨大示威运动的。它显示了伊朗人民团结一致为摆脱帝国主义束缚、争取自由的决心。美、英帝国主义者正在设法把伊朗变成反苏战争的基地。他们打算把伊朗变成第二个朝鲜。
    声明最后号召英国的劳工运动和民主舆论立即动员起来，积极提出抗议，不准一兵一卒派到伊朗去。声明指出：这种军事冒险就是一个大挑衅；而且将使英国人的生命为石油垄断公司的帝国主义政策而牺牲。
