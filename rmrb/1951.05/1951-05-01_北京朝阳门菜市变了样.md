　　The Beijing Chaoyangmen Market Transformed
        Kang Weizhong
    The Chaoyangmen Market on Beijing's Chaoyangmen Avenue is the largest in the city in terms of vegetable supply, with over 130 stalls. In the past, most vendors adulterated goods, used small scales, arbitrarily set prices, and didn't issue receipts, leading to serious tax evasion. As a result, disputes frequently arose between vendors and administrative management, with customers, and even among the vendors themselves. Vendors were historically difficult to manage, but during the Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Campaign, the Chaoyangmen Market has transformed. Before the Spring Festival, various industries completed their competition plans. After the Spring Festival, they formulated a patriotic pact, establishing clear and marked pricing. To be responsible to customers, they decided to put their names on their stalls, so customers could find them if there were any issues with the prices. To ensure implementation, they supervised each other and fought against individual vendors who didn't follow the marked prices. For example, cloth merchant Xiao Zhenchang's marked price for cloth was originally 3,000 yuan per foot, but he actually sold it for 2,900 yuan; Li Yijia marked pork at 4,500 yuan per jin, but actually sold it for 4,300 yuan. This undercutting of the marked price was superficially for small profits and quick turnover, but in essence, it was a tax evasion tactic. In addition, they established penalty rules: a fine would be imposed for exceeding or falling below the marked price by 100 yuan, and so on. They also set penalty rules for deceiving customers. To prevent the omission of delivery slips in the grain industry, they automatically organized three-person interlocking teams to supervise each other and be responsible to customers. For example, a female comrade from a certain agency bought a chicken at the market and found worms inside. She brought it back to exchange it, but the seller had already left. At that time, vendor Li Yaoting kept the chicken and promised to exchange it for a good one the next day. Many onlookers were moved and praised him, saying the market had changed.
    The Resist America, Aid Korea education made the vendors realize that actively paying taxes was a concrete manifestation of patriotism. In the past, tax evasion and arrears were very serious among the vendors. Now that they have implemented the patriotic pact, they not only pay taxes in advance but also automatically increase their tax payments. Vendors were originally assessed tax amounts every three months (meaning a fixed tax amount was levied uniformly for three months), but as they implemented small profits and quick turnover in the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign, their business volume increased month by month, and they consciously proposed revising their tax amounts. For example, Shang Shujing from the dried goods market originally assessed at 1.8 million yuan in business volume, voluntarily revised and increased it to 2.2 million yuan. Vendor Zhao Shuxun's business volume was originally assessed at 2 million yuan and voluntarily increased it to 2.7 million yuan. Many vendors automatically increased their business tax amounts in this way. In the grain industry alone, the amount of taxes automatically increased reached one-third of the original tax amount. The original turnover was 290 million yuan, and it has now increased to 370 million yuan. They created many ways to pay taxes in advance. For example, in the fish and chicken industries, they formed industry groups, with the group leader responsible for collecting payments every three to five days and depositing them in the bank to accumulate small amounts into large sums, ensuring the completion of tax payments by the end of the month. Some industries collected a small amount from each person every day, pooled it together when due, and submitted it group by group. According to regulations, the taxes for March should be paid between April 1st and 5th, but by the end of March, they had all been paid within two hours. Because they realized that paying taxes increased the strength to resist America and aid Korea, they criticized and fought against individual vendors who evaded taxes. For example, when chicken merchant Wu Yanzhong secretly led merchants to his home to conduct transactions, they sent people to track him down, held a meeting to criticize and punish him, and sent the merchant to the tax bureau for processing. Thanks to the mutual supervision of the vendors, the tax revenue for March increased by more than 17 million yuan compared to December of last year.

　　北京朝阳门菜市变了样
        康伟中
    北京朝阳门大街的菜市，在供应菜蔬量上是全市最大的一个，有一百三十多家。过去由于大多数摊贩在经营中掺水使假，使用小秤，随便作价要钱，不开发票，严重地造成偷漏税收的现象。因此，摊贩与行政管理，与顾客之间，甚至摊贩与摊贩之间经常发生纠纷。摊贩历来是难以管理的，但在抗美援朝爱国运动中，朝阳门的菜市已变了样。在春节前，各行业之间完成竞赛计划，春节后，他们又制定了爱国公约，确定了明码标价。为了对顾客负责，他们并决定在自己摊上插上自己的名字，如在货价上发生问题，顾客也好找寻。为了保证实行，他们互相监督，并与个别不按明码办事的摊贩进行斗争。如布商萧震昌的明码布价每尺原为三千元，但他实际卖价为二千九百元；李义家每斤猪肉标价为四千五百元，实际卖价为四千三百元。这种低于明码价卖出的原因，从表面看是为了薄利广销，而实质上是偷漏税收的行为。另外，他们又规定了罚规，高于或低于明码价一百元者，即罚款，依此类推。对欺骗顾客的现象，他们自己也定出罚规。粮食业为防止漏开发货票，他们自动组织三人的连环小组，互相监督，互相对顾客负责。如某机关一位女同志，在菜市买一只鸡，回去发现鸡肚内生虫，即带来换，但卖主已经走了。当时，摊贩李耀亭即将鸡留在他处，负责明天换好的。当时很多围看的顾客都很感动，个个称赞，都说这个菜市场已经变了。
    抗美援朝的教育，使摊贩们认识到积极地缴纳税收就是具体的爱国表现。过去摊贩的偷税、漏税、欠税的现象是很严重的。现在他们实行了爱国公约，不仅纷纷提前缴税，而且自动地增加了税收。摊贩原为三个月评一次税额（即三个月内统一按一个税额计征），但由于他们在抗美援朝中，执行了薄利广销，营业额逐月增加，他们即自觉地提出修正税额。如干菜市尚书经原来评定营业额为一百八十万元，自动修改增加到二百二十万元。摊贩赵树勋营业额原评为二百万元，也自动增加到二百七十万元。像这样自动增加营业税额的摊贩很多。仅粮食业自动增加税额的即达原税额的三分之一，原来流水额为二亿九千万元，现已增加到三亿七千万元。他们为了提前缴税，创造了很多的办法。如鱼、鸡等业，他们以行业小组为单位，组长负责每隔三五天收款一次，集中存入银行，以便零存整取，保证月底完成税收。有的行业，每人每天零抽，到期凑齐，组组汇缴。按照规定，三月份的税款应在四月一日至五日内缴清，但到三月底，两个钟头内即全部缴齐了。由于他们认识到纳税是增加抗美援朝的力量，对于个别逃税的摊贩曾进行了批评和斗争，如鸡商吴衍中，偷领行商至其家中交易，他们即派人跟踪查出，开大会批评、处分，并将行商送到税务局处理。经过摊贩的互相监督，三月份纳税额较去年十二月增加一千七百余万元。
