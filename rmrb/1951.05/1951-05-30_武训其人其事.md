The Person and Deeds of Wu Xun
谢兴尧

To discuss "The Story of Wu Xun," it is necessary to clarify Wu Xun's life story and many facts directly related to him. What kind of person was Wu Xun really? How did he really "promote education"? This article intends to provide some basic objective information on these two questions.

I. Wu Xun's Life and the Era He Lived In

Wu Xun's life was lived during a period of severe internal and external troubles in China. He was born in 1838 (the 18th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty), two years after the "Opium War" (1840). He died in 1896 (the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), two years before the "Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95," and two years before the "Hundred Days' Reform." During these decades, there was the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolutionary movement, the anti-Qing movements of the Nian Rebellion in the north and the Hui people in the southwest, as well as the Anglo-French allied forces' capture of Beijing, the death of the Manchu Emperor Yizhu (Xianfeng) in Rehe, and so-called "religious cases" of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism occurred everywhere. This period was truly a period of great upheaval in modern Chinese history.

Wu Xun was from Wu Village, Liulin Town, northwest of Tangyi County, Pingyuan Province (formerly Shandong Province), and came from a poor peasant family. He was the seventh child in his family, originally named "Wu Qi (Seven)," and later the Prefect of Linqing Zhou Honglie renamed him "Wu Xun." When he was very young, his father died. It is said that he wanted to go to school to study, but his mother, Cui, said, "Books are not for poor people to read." But he still often went outside the private school of the landlord's family to eavesdrop, wanting to ask to enter the school, but he was scolded and humiliated by the landlord's teacher. When he was seven years old, his mother also died (according to the "Memorial Requesting Enshrinement in the National History Archives" by Yuan Shuxun, the Shandong Governor of the Qing Dynasty, and "Record of the Beginning and End of Wu Xun's Promotion of Education" by Sha Mingyuan). From then on, he was raised by his aunt and learned to farm with his elder brother, Wu Qian. At the age of fifteen, he went to work as a child laborer at his uncle Zhang's shop in his maternal family, where he suffered abuse and was forced to leave Zhang's house. At the age of seventeen, he went to work for three years at the home of Li Laobian, a large landlord in Xuedian Village, Guantao County. Because he spilled some pig feed and pasted up Spring Festival couplets without permission, he was scolded and beaten by Li Laobian. His annual wage was sixteen strings of cash, but after he worked for three years, Li Laobian cheated him because he was illiterate, using false accounts to not only refuse to pay him his three years' wages, but also swallowed the money his sister brought him, and falsely accused him of blackmail, beat him severely, and kicked him out. Because of this, he attributed his suffering to illiteracy. It is said that after he slept in a broken temple for three days, he went around begging people for money and food, constantly saying he wanted to start a "free school." The local people said he was suffering from "free school syndrome," and because he was confused, they called him "Silly Seven" or "Wu Doumo (Bean Curd)" (Zhao Judu's "Wu Xun Promotes Education Stele Inscription").

Wu Xun's youth coincided with the era of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolutionary uprising. In 1853 (the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty), Hong Xiuquan captured Nanjing, and Nian Army leader Zhang Lexing launched an uprising in Mengcheng, Anhui. At that time, Wu Xun was fifteen years old. The following year (1854), the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's Northern Expeditionary Army captured Linqing Prefecture City, a neighboring county of Tangyi, and defended Gaotang Prefecture near Linqing for half a year. The Nian Army continued to resist the Qing army in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Shaanxi and other places, with the area around Caozhou and Juye in Shandong as their base, until they were defeated by the Manchu Qing in 1868 (the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty). Two years later, in 1870, there was the anti-imperialist struggle of the patriotic people of Tianjin, known by the feudal rulers as the "Tianjin Religious Case."

Wu Xun remained deaf and blind to all these events. When Wu Xun was twenty-one years old in 1859 (the ninth year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty), the Anglo-French allied forces were attacking Dagu and Tianjin. Under that tense situation, he was even more active in "begging for alms to promote education." He sang more than thirty songs while begging, including: "Working for others is subject to bullying, it's better to beg on your own. Don't look down on me for begging, I'll build a free school sooner or later." "Don't嫌多，不嫌少、舍些金钱修义学；又有名，又行好，文昌帝君知道了，准叫你子子孙孙坐八抬大轿。” [TN: This appears to be a saying or poem that is difficult to translate directly but calls for charitable donations for building a free school promising prosperity and good fortune to descendants.]

Wu Xun used many bizarre and ugly methods to attract attention while begging. At the age of twenty-three, he shaved off his pigtail, leaving only a small peach-shaped tuft of hair on one side, tied into a small braid. To coax money from children, he often played tricks such as standing a tripod upright, scorpion crawling, rolling a wheel, and giving people rides on his back. Once, "A rich man had a good mule. He said to Wu Xun: Doumo, if you can eat a mule dung ball, I can donate this fast mule to you. Wu Xun... immediately put the mule dung ball into his mouth, ate it, and led the mule away." (Han Duofeng, "Using Mr. Wu Xun as a Mirror"). He also used eating snakes, scorpions, bricks and tiles to scare people into giving money. In addition, he occasionally made money by grinding, milling, reaping wheat, watering gardens, carrying loads, pulling carts, twisting thread, weaving belts, and ginning cotton. But these incomes were very small.

By the time he was thirty years old (1868, the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), he received three mu of land when he separated from his brother, which he sold for one hundred and twenty strings of cash, plus his own savings of ninety strings, totaling two hundred and ten strings. He entrusted these to Wu Jinshi (a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) Lou Junling and Jinshi Yang Shufang to lend to the poor at interest. From then on, he became a usurer, and thus became a big landlord, which was the real economic foundation for him to run the "free school." The interest he charged was very high, and the principal and interest were equal in one year. Therefore, from the age of thirty-one to the age of fifty (1888, the fourteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), as a result of the principal and interest rolling back and forth, he had more than two hundred and thirty mu of land and more than two thousand eight hundred strings of cash in Liulin.

In the spring of 1888, the "free school" in Liulin Town was officially established, named "Chongxian Yishu (Revering the Worthy Free School)." At this time, he already had contact with large officials such as the county magistrate and the provincial governor of the Manchu Qing. He used this position to contract for marriages of men and women and land and house transactions everywhere. According to his student Sha Mingyuan's "Complete Account of Wu Xun's Promotion of Education," he "acted as a matchmaker for the children of towns and villages, and brokered land and house transactions. There was no village woman or old man who did not know Wu Doumo. The wealth he obtained from match making and begging at gatherings reached a huge sum of thousands of strings of cash." He himself sang: "Free school syndrome, matchmaker red, this marriage is easy to succeed."

At this time, his brother, seeing that he had become rich, asked to borrow money from him. It is said that: "His brother asked neighbors to lend him money, but Mr. Wu Xun refused. Later, he rented land to his brother, but because he refused to pay rent, he was also dismissed. He angrily sang: 'I accumulate money, I buy fields, to build a free school for the poor. Who supports the family, who enriches himself, prepare for the thunder of heaven to strike.'" (Wang Lianquan, "The Spirit of Mr. Wu Xun"). When his aunt (another saying is his mother) died, his brother asked him to go home to keep vigil, and he said: "It's okay to go home to keep vigil, but you have to give me one hundred cash for every cry." The villagers all said that "Wu Doumo only recognizes money" (Zang Kejia, "Wu Xun's Free School Syndrome").

In 1890 (the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), Wu Xun was fifty-two years old. In Yang'er Village, Guantao County, there was a monk named Liao Zheng in the Thousand Buddha Temple who also wanted to run a "free school," so he donated part of the temple property, bought more than eighty mu of land, and built more than ten houses. Everything was ready, but he lacked start-up funds. When Wu Xun heard the news, he went to the Thousand Buddha Temple to find the monk Liao Zheng, and was willing to subsidize him two hundred and thirty strings of cash. Thus, the Yang'er Village "Free School" in Guantao County was easily established, named "Guantao Yang'er Village Free School."

Wu Xun's reputation grew, and the money that rolled in from lending became more. At this time (1891, the seventeenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), he often went to Linqing's urban and rural areas to "beg," but this beggar always lived in the house of the gentry Shi Shanzheng, and no longer lived in broken temples. Because Linqing had been captured by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's Northern Expeditionary Army and then ravaged by the Qing army, Wu Xun discussed with Shi Shanzheng and wanted to establish a third "free school" in Linqing. A year later, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Yu De, passed through Linqing and was stopped by Wu Xun to solicit donations. He donated two hundred taels of silver. Wu Xun then bought a house base in Yushi Lane in the southwest of Linqing for four hundred taels of silver. Construction began in 1894 and was completed the following year. It officially opened in 1896 (the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty). In addition to savings, he also purchased two shops and six hundred mu of school land, which could collect more than three hundred strings of rent every year. This was the third "free school" founded by Wu Xun, called "Linqing Yushi Lane Free School." Wu Xun died in the summer of this year. General biographies say that he died in the Yushi Lane "Free School" in Linqing, and some say that he died "under the eaves," but in fact he died of old age in Shi Shanzheng's home (see Chen Enpu's "Wu Xun Promotes Education Stele Inscription" and Gong Jibing's "Ode to Linqing Wu Xun School").

II. How Did Wu Xun Promote Education?

When Wu Xun was twenty-one years old, he shouted the slogan of "promoting education," but until he was thirty-one years old, he was only seen "begging," and he was not seen "promoting education." It wasn't until he separated from his brother and sold the three mu of land for one hundred and twenty strings of cash, plus his ten years of savings of ninety strings, that he had two hundred and ten strings of cash. He entrusted this money to the landlords Lou Junling and Yang Shufang to lend out at interest. From then on, he transformed from a beggar into a usurer, and from empty talk of "begging to promote education" into the reality of "lending to promote education." He himself said: "Saving capital, generating interest, promoting free school, no worries." He also said: "The poor use it, the rich guarantee it, running a free school is foolproof." Regarding his begging life, it is said: "Lending to generate interest, to prepare for school construction, carrying two small baskets on his shoulders, one basket containing tools for hiring labor, and one basket containing debt books wrapped in oilcloth. When lending, he knelt down to ask people to write in the book, and wrapped the book in oilcloth, fearing that the road would get wet with rain." (Zhao Judu's "Wu Xun Promotes Education Stele Inscription") This shows that he was "lending to promote education," not "begging to promote education." Thus, the principal and interest rolled back and forth for nearly twenty years, and he also bought land and collected rent. By the time he was fifty years old (1888, the fourteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), he had already "accumulated vast wealth." When he built the "free school" in Liulin Town, the landlord Guo Fen donated one mu and eight fen of land, and the student of the Imperial Academy Mu Yun donated two mu of land as the school base. More than twenty school buildings were built and surrounded by walls (Zhang Yuanheng, "Record of Wu Xun Promoting Education"). The total construction cost was four thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven strings. In addition to the two thousand eight hundred strings he already had, the remaining shortfall was raised by Yang Shufang from the local gentry. The entire project and funding were "managed" by Yang Shufang.

After the establishment of the "Chongxian Yishu" in Liulin Town, Guo Chunxu, the magistrate of Tangyi County, went to the free school to inspect and talked with him, and gave him ten taels of silver. Then Zhang Yao, the Shandong Governor, received a report from Guo Chunxu of Tangyi County and specially invited him to the provincial capital, donating two hundred taels of silver to him, and also giving him a donation register made of yellow silk with a large seal, asking him to boldly solicit donations. Because he raised a lot of money, he no longer "knelt down to ask people to write in the book," so he asked his clan grandson Wu Maolin to help him manage the accounts. He actually became an official fundraiser appointed by the government.

As for the establishment of the Yang'er Village Free School in Guantao County in 1890 (the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), it was almost entirely done by the monk Liao Zheng. He only subsidized two hundred and thirty strings of cash and wrote the name of the school under his name. At this time, Wu Xun not only raised donations well in society, but also had enough silver donated by Guo Chunxu, Zhang Yao, etc.

Wu Xun established two "free schools" in two years in a row, so "when he arrived in Linqing, his reputation was great, and the successive state herdsmen and school principals, up to the governor and provincial judge, were happy to donate, and the locals also attached importance to it." (Chen Enpu, "Record of Mr. Wu Xun's Promotion of Education"). After 1891, when he wanted to run a third "free school" in Linqing, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, Yu De, donated two hundred taels of silver, and built a large-scale project in Yushi Lane. The school site was completed in 1895 and officially opened the following year. His biography said: "In addition to deposits, he also purchased two shops and six hundred mu of school land." Its funding was very abundant.

If we calculate Wu Xun's income in thirty years, the recorded major income totaled 410 taels of silver, 4,608 strings of cash, and 913.8 mu of land. The expenditure was 400 taels of silver and 5,017 strings of cash. It is impossible to find out how much money was spent on buying school land. According to Zhang Yao's memorial, Wu Xun took out more than 7,000 strings of cash (including 230 mu of land) in Liulin Town to run the "free school," equivalent to 2,000 taels of silver. Later, the Yang'er Village Free School in Guantao County and the Yushi Lane Free School in Linqing were mostly built with other people's money, so they were established more smoothly.

Wu Xun's Donation Income and Expenditure Table for Promoting Education

Income Expenditure
Silver/Cash (or Land/Houses) Donors Item Location
2,800 strings Wu Xun 4,787 strings Liulin Town
Building 20 houses
1,578 strings Public donation from neighboring villages 230 strings (start-up fee) Yang'er Village
230 mu of land (Liulin Town) Wu Xun 400 taels of silver (buying school site) Yushi Lane
1.8 mu of land (Liulin Town) Guo Fen Buying two shops Yushi Lane
2 mu of land (Liulin Town) Mu Yun 600 mu of school land Yushi Lane
10 taels of silver Guo Chunxu
200 taels of silver Zhang Yao
80 mu of land (Yang'er Village) Monk Liao Zheng
10+ houses (Yang'er Village) Monk Liao Zheng
230 strings (Yang'er Village) Wu Xun
200 taels of silver (Yushi Lane) Yu De

As for his handling of silver and money, his student Sha Mingyuan said in his detailed account of promoting education: "From one string to thousands of strings, the accumulated interest is complex and varied, and the daily, monthly, and annual interest are also complicated and mixed, and all changes are possible. Wu Xun was not only illiterate, but also did not understand mathematics, only relying on his mind to remember, then even the slightest odd and zero would be accounted for. Therefore, as a creditor for decades, there has never been a debt dispute." It can be seen that Wu Xun was very meticulous in lending. The Wu Xun Biography in Shandong Gazetteer also said that he: "Calculated interest at three percent per year, accumulating bit by bit, until it became a huge sum." The interest Wu Xun charged was actually higher than three percent; he was "able to equate the principal and interest in one year" (Zang Kejia, "Wu Xun's Free School Syndrome"). Wu Xun's money was obtained through exploitation.

As for what kind of talents his three free schools cultivated, the largest and earliest "free school" was the "Chongxian Yishu" in Liulin Town. This "Yishu" was divided into two sections: Jing (classics) and Meng (elementary), Meng section for enlightenment, Jing section for reading classics. The teachers were Cui Zhun, a Juren (successful candidate in the imperial examinations at the provincial level) from Shouzhang County, and Gu Zhongan, a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) from Liaocheng County. The entire school initially had more than thirty formal students and more than twenty external students, totaling more than fifty students (according to Zhang Yao's memorial). Later, there were only twelve students, and the local government allowed it to supplement eighteen students (according to Chen Yuan's report from the magistrate of Tangyi County to the provincial judicial commissioner). Judging from the status of the teachers, the content of the teaching, and the number of students, it can be imagined that the composition of the students would not be children of poor peasants. Among the students who can be verified, there is Sha Mingyuan, a member of the House of Representatives in the early Republic of China who "witnessed the hard work in the school at a young age."

From this, it can be seen that Wu Xun's so-called "begging for education" was indeed a huge deception, and that Wu Xun used three types of farmers' blood and sweat – high interest rates, land rent, and official donations – to run schools for the children of landlords, and called this unjust education a "free school," was also a huge deception.

　　武训其人其事
    谢兴尧
    为了讨论“武训传”，需要弄清楚武训的生平事迹和许多与武训有直接关系的事实。武训究竟是怎样的人呢？他究竟是怎样“兴学”的呢？本文打算对这两个问题提供一些基本的客观的资料。
  一、武训的生平和他所处的时代
    武训的一生是处在中国内忧外患十分严重的时期。他生于一八三八年（清道光十八年），两年之后（一八四○年）便是“鸦片战争”。他死于一八九六年（清光绪二十二年），两年之前是“甲午之战”，两年之后是“戊戌政变”。在这几十年中，国内有太平天国的革命运动，有北方捻军、西南回民的反清运动，还有英法联军攻陷北京，满清皇帝奕詝（咸丰）走死热河，反帝反封建的所谓“教案”到处发生。这一时期实在是中国近代史上一个大动荡的时代。
    武训是今平原省（前属山东省）堂邑县西北柳林镇武家庄的人，出身于贫苦的农民之家。他的大排行是第七，原名“武七”，后来临清州尹庄鸿烈为他改名为“武训”。在他很小的时候，他的父亲便死了。传说他曾想上学读书，他的母亲崔氏说：“书，不是穷人念的。”但他仍然常到地主家专馆门外去偷听，想请求入学，又受到地主家教师的呵斥和辱骂。他七岁时母亲又死了（据清山东巡抚袁树勋“请宣付史馆立传折”及沙明远“记武训兴学始末”所述）。从此他便受他伯母的抚养，跟他哥哥武谦学种地。十五岁时到他姨父张老板家扛小活（即作童工），受尽虐待，被逼离开张家。十七岁到馆陶县薛店庄的大地主李老辫家去扛了三年活，因为洒了点猪食，倒贴了春联，曾被李老辫辱骂苦打。他每年的工钱是十六吊，但在他作了三年工以后，李老辫欺他不识字，用假账骗他，不但不给他三年的工钱，还吞没了他姐姐带给他的钱，并且反诬他讹诈，把他痛打一顿，推出门去。因为这样，他就把他所受的痛苦归咎于不识字。据说：他在一个破庙里昏睡了三天以后，他就到处疯疯癫癫地向人要钱要饭，口里不停地说要办“义学”。当地的人们都说他是患了“义学症”，又因他糊涂，所以叫他做“傻七”或“武豆沫”（赵局度“武训兴学碑文”）。
    武训的青年时代正值太平天国革命起义时代。一八五三年（清咸丰三年）洪秀全攻克南京，捻军张乐行在安徽蒙城起义，时武训正十五岁。次年（一八五四年）太平天国北伐军攻克堂邑邻县临清州城，又在临清附近高唐州坚守了半年之久，而捻军则一直在山东、河南、安徽、陕西各地反抗清军，并以山东曹州、巨野一带为根据地，直至一八六八年（清同治七年）才被满清所攻破。两年以后，一八七○年又有天津爱国人民的反帝斗争，即封建统治者所称的“天津教案”。
    对于所有这些事变，武训都置之不闻不问。当一八五九年（清咸丰九年）武训二十一岁时，英法联军正攻打大沽、天津，在那紧张的形势下，他“行乞兴学”反更积极。他在行乞时唱过三十多首歌，其中有：“扛活受人欺，不如讨饭随自己。别看我讨饭，早晚修个义学院。”“不嫌多，不嫌少、舍些金钱修义学；又有名，又行好，文昌帝君知道了，准叫你子子孙孙坐八抬大轿。”
    武训的行乞用了许多离奇和丑恶的方法，来引人注意。他在二十三岁时把头上的辫子剃掉，只在一边留下小桃形的一撮发，结成小辫。为了哄小孩们的钱，他常玩竖鼎、蝎子爬、打车轮、以及给人做马骑一类的把戏。曾有一次，“有一富翁有一匹好骡子，他对武训说：豆沫，你若能将骡粪蛋吃下一个，我可以把这头快骡捐给你。武训……即把骡粪蛋塞进口内吃下，牵了骡子就走。”（韩多峰“以武训先生作镜子”）。他又以吃蛇蝎砖瓦来吓唬人给钱。此外，他也间或作些推磨、推碾、割麦子、浇园、挑担、拉车、捻线头、编鞶带、轧棉花、纺线等来赚钱维持生活。但这些收入都是很少的。
    到他三十岁（一八六八年清同治七年）时，和他哥哥分家得到三亩地，变卖了一百二十吊钱，加上他自己积存的九十吊，合计二百一十吊。交由武进士娄峻岭、进士杨树芳二人替他向穷人放债生息，从此他成为高利贷者，并因此而又成了大地主，这便是他办“义学”的真实经济基础。他放债的利钱很大，一年就本利相等。因此从他三十一岁起到他五十岁时（一八八八年清光绪十四年）因本利来回滚的结果，他在柳林已有土地二百三十多亩，现钱二千八百多吊。
    一八八八年春天，柳林镇“义学”正式成立，定名为“崇贤义塾”。这时他和满清的知县、巡抚等大官都已有了往来。他利用这种地位，又到处包办男女婚姻和田房交易。据他的学生沙明远所记他的“兴学始末”，他曾“与城镇儿女代联姻戚，躬为媒妁，并经纪田房交易，凡村妪里叟无不识武豆沫者。媒妁与行乞于集会间所得之资财，达千缗巨额焉。”他自己也唱道：“义学症，作媒红，这桩亲事容易成。”
    这时候，他的哥哥见他发了财，曾向他借钱。据说：“其兄托乡邻乞贷，先生不许，后来租给他兄长的田地，因为不肯缴纳租金，也被他辞去。并愤激的歌道：“我积钱，我买田，修个义学为贫寒。谁养家，谁肥己，准备上天雷神击。”（汪濂泉“武训先生的精神”。及至他的伯母（另一说是他的母亲）死了，他哥哥叫他回家守灵，他说：“回家守灵可以，不过哭一声你得给我一百钱。”老乡们都说“武豆沫就光认得钱”（臧克家“武训义学症”）。
    一八九○年（清光绪十六年）武训五十二岁。馆陶县千佛寺有个了证和尚，也想在杨二庄办一个“义学”，曾把一部分庙产捐出来，买了八十多亩地，修了十多间房子，一切都已齐备，只是缺少开办费。武训听到了这个消息，便到千佛寺去找了证和尚，并愿补助他二百三十吊钱，于是杨二庄“义塾”，便很容易地成立起来，定名为“馆陶杨二庄义塾”。
    武训的名望更大了，由放账滚来的钱更多了。此时（一八九一年，清光绪十七年）他常到临清城乡去“行乞”，但这位要饭的，总住在绅士施善政家里，再也不住破庙了。因临清曾被太平天国北伐军攻克，后又被清军屠杀而萧条残破，武训便与施善政商量，想在临清创办第三个“义学”。一年以后有满清王朝的学部侍郎裕德路过临清，被武训拦着募捐，他捐了二百两银子。武训便又在临清西南关御史巷用四百两银子买下了一所宅基，一八九四年开始兴工，次年落成，一八九六年（清光绪二十二年）正式开学。除了存款外，又添购了两处铺房，六百亩学田，每年能收租子三百多吊，这是武训创办的第三所“义学”，称为“临清御史巷义学”。就在这年的夏天，武训死了。一般传记都说他死在临清御史巷“义塾”，还有说他死在“屋檐下边”的，其实他是老死在施善政家里的（见陈恩普“武训兴学碑文”及龚积炳“临清武训学校颂”）。

            二、武训是怎样兴学的？
    武训二十一岁时，便喊出“兴学”的口号，直至他三十一岁，还是只见他“行乞”，并没见他“兴学”。及和他哥哥分了家，把三亩地卖了一百二十吊钱，加上他十年的积蓄九十吊，这才有二百一十吊钱。他把这钱交地主娄峻岭、杨树芳二人替他放债生息。从此他由乞丐一变而为高利贷者，又由“行乞兴学”的空谈，变为“放债兴学”的实际。他自己说：“存本钱，生利钱，兴义学，没心烦。”又说：“穷的使，富的保，办个义学错不了。”关于他的行乞生活，据云：“放债生息，以备修学之用，肩挑二小篓，一篓贮行佣器具，一篓贮债簿而裹一油布，盖放债则跪求人写于簿内，以油布裹簿，恐道途雨沾湿也。”（赵局度“武训兴学碑文”）这说明他是“放债兴学”，而不是什么“行乞兴学”。由是本利来回滚，滚了将近二十年，又加买了土地，收取地租，到他五十岁时（一八八八年清光绪十四年）就已经“积资巨万”了。他在柳林镇修建“义学”时，地主郭芬捐地一亩八分，监生穆云捐地二亩作为校基，修建校舍二十余间，围以墙垣（张元亨“武训兴学记”）。修建费总共用四千七百八十七吊，除了他已有的二千八百吊外，其余不敷的由杨树芳向当地绅耆募捐，全部工程和经费都由杨树芳“董理”。
    柳林镇“崇贤义塾”成立后，堂邑知县郭春煦去义学视察，和他谈话，并赠他十两银子。接着便是山东巡抚张曜接到堂邑县郭春煦的报告后，特别邀请他到省城去，捐给他二百两银子，另外还给他一本用黄绫做的盖了大印的捐册，叫他大胆劝募。他因为募款多了，不再“跪求人写于簿内”，就请他的族孙武茂林帮他管理账目。他实际上成了官派的筹款大员了。
    至于一八九○年（清光绪十六年）馆陶杨二庄义学的建立，几乎完全是了证和尚所做的，他只补助了二百三十吊钱，便把这所义学写在他的名下。这时的武训，不只在社会上好募捐，即郭春煦、张曜等的捐银也用不完。
    武训在两年之间，一连成立了两所“义学”，所以“后至临清，声誉大著，历任州牧及学正，上至巡抚藩臬皆乐为捐输，土人亦重视之。”（陈恩普“武训先生兴学记”）。一八九一年后，他要想在临清办第三个“义学”，便有学部侍郎裕德捐银二百两、在御史巷大兴土木，一八九五年校址落成，次年即正式开学。他的传记说：“除了存款外，又添购了两处铺房，六百亩学田。”它的经费非常充裕。
    我们若替武训结算一下，他在三十年间有案可查的大宗收入，共银四百一十两，钱四千六百零八吊，土地九百一十三亩八分。支出是银四百两，钱五千零十七吊。买学田的时候花多少钱则无从查考。武训办“义学”时，据张曜的奏片说，在柳林镇共拿出七千多吊钱（连土地二百三十亩在内），合二千两银子。后来馆陶杨二庄、临清御史巷两义学，则大半都是别人的钱，所以成立得更加顺利了。

    至于他对银钱的处理办法，他的学生沙明远记其兴学始末曾说：“自一缗至千缗，其利之相积，错落万端，而日利、月利、年利又纷歧杂揉，变幻无不至。训既不知书，复不通数理，惟恃一心记忆，则纤微奇零，无弗综贯。故身为债权者数十年，未尝有债务纠葛事。”可见武训放债却是很精细的。山东通志武训传也说他：“岁以三分计息，铢积寸累，遂至巨万。”武训所放的利钱，实际上比三分还要高，他是“一年子母可以相等”（臧克家“武训的义学症”）。武训的钱，便是这样剥削来的。
    至于他这三个义学，究竟造就出了一些什么样的人才？按“义学”中最大的一个也是最早的一个是柳林镇的“崇贤义塾”。这个“义塾”分为经蒙两馆，蒙馆启蒙，经馆读经。教师是寿张县的举人崔准和聊城县的进士顾仲安。全塾最初有正式学生三十余人，外课生二十余人，共五十余人（据张曜奏片），到了后来只有十二人，地方政府让它再补充十八名（据堂邑知县陈瑗覆臬司禀）。由教师的地位，教学的内容，学生的人数看，都可以想像学生的成份不会是贫苦的农民子弟。学生中可考的，就有一个“髫龄在塾，目睹苦操”的民国初年众议院议员沙明远。
    由此可见，武训的所谓“行乞兴学”，固然是一个绝大的欺骗，而武训用高利、地租、官僚捐助三种农民血汗来给地主子弟办学，还称这种不义之学为“义学”，也是一个绝大的欺骗。
