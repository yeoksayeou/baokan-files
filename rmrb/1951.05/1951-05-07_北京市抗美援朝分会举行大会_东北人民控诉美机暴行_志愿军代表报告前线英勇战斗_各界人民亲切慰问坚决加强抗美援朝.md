Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Beijing Branch of the Resist-America Aid-Korea Association held a meeting this afternoon at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. The meeting was for the people of Northeast China to accuse the American imperialists of aggressive atrocities, and for representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to report on their heroic fighting at the front. The venue displayed photographs of the American aircraft's bombing atrocities in Andong City, the blood-stained clothes of the victims, and photographs of the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front. More than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing attended the meeting. Eleven members of the British People's Delegation, led by York Cain, also participated. The Beijing People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the meeting live to the city. Schools, factories, and districts throughout the city organized listening groups to tune in. During the meeting, 728 listening locations and listening groups representing more than 200,000 listeners called the meeting to express their condolences to the families of the victims and pay their respects to the People's Volunteer Army.

At the beginning of the meeting, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Resist-America Aid-Korea Association, delivered the opening speech. Duan Yongjie, head of the Northeast People's Delegation Accusing American Atrocities and Deputy Mayor of Andong City, reported on the heroic struggle of the people of Andong City under the bombing of American aircraft. Seven representatives of the delegation successively made accusations at the meeting. Yu Zoushi and Du Lengshi, women from Andong City, accused American aircraft of bombing and killing their husbands. Xu Guochen, a driver from the Linjiang Locomotive Depot of the Jilin Railway Bureau, who was bombed twice, accused American aircraft of blowing off four fingers of his left hand during the first bombing and destroying his home during the second. Zhu Jing, a female student from Shenyang No. 17 Middle School, accused Kuomintang-American special agents of brutally murdering her father. Aunt Qu, a rescue model and army-support model from Andong City, accused the American aircraft of bombing Andong City and recounted her experiences of rescuing fellow citizens during the bombing. The audience applauded and paid tribute to her. Liu, an old woman from Linjiang County whose son was killed in the bombing, said during her accusation: "American imperialism killed one of my sons, but I still have two sons. I will properly persuade them to study and raise them well, to avenge my dead son! Down with American imperialism!" Lin Xianting, a stevedore from Andong City whose wife and son were killed in the bombing, said: "I lost my father at seventeen and my mother at eighteen. I herded cattle for the landlord, and I couldn't get enough to eat or wear. My old partner and I didn't wear a new piece of clothing or taste a drop of oil for more than thirty years. After the liberation of Northeast China, I became a stevedore, and life gradually improved. Our children grew up strong and big. Only a short time after our happy days began, American planes bombed my old partner and my children to death! Compatriots! How many Chinese and Korean people, like my old partner and my son, have been killed by the American devils! We must unite closely and avenge them!" The slogans "Avenge the dead compatriots!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Pay tribute to the heroic people of Andong City!" resounded throughout the venue.

Ahern, a member of the British People's Delegation, spoke at the meeting. He said: "The British People's Delegation participated in this accusation meeting and heard the speeches and accusations of the victims who suffered under the brutal bombing of American imperialist aircraft. We are deeply moved.

We vow to the conference: when we return to the UK, we will certainly convene a conference throughout the country to tell the British people the truth about the bombing of Andong by American imperialist aircraft.

The British people suffered greatly from the indiscriminate bombing of fascist bandits during the Second World War, and they will understand the pain suffered by the Chinese people. American imperialism cannot conquer the Chinese people!" He then shouted: "Long live the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao!

Long live the unity of the Chinese and British people!

Long live the unity of the people of the world!" and other slogans.

When Ahern spoke, the audience shouted, "Long live the unity of the Chinese and British people!" Ma Baoqi, Director of the Women's Representative Conference of the 12th Precinct of the Fifth District, called the conference on behalf of the local women to pay tribute to the British People's Delegation.

When Bi Jirong, a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reported on the heroic fighting of the Volunteer Army on the Korean front, the audience shouted, "Celebrate the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army!" Five Young Pioneer members from May 1st Girls' Middle School presented flowers to the People's Volunteer Army on behalf of all the Young Pioneer members of the school.

All the representatives attending the meeting accepted the suggestions of the off-site audience, stood up together, and observed a moment of silence to mourn the dead compatriots. During the accusation, citizens from various districts who listened to the live broadcast of the meeting called the conference chairman one after another, expressing their hatred for American imperialism and warmly comforting the families of the victims and the People's Volunteer Army. Many factories, schools, and citizens rushed to send condolence letters, condolence gifts, and condolence money. Everyone unanimously stated that they must do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea to avenge the dead compatriots. Li Yong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union, called the conference to express condolences to Xu Guochen and all the victims, and called on railway workers across the country to respond to the American imperialist aggression with practical actions to strengthen transportation and support the front lines. Ninety workers in the Guanghua Cotton Weaving Factory are from Andong. When they heard about the tragic deaths of their fellow villagers in the bombing from the radio, they all cried. They immediately called the conference and said that they would definitely take practical actions to increase production to avenge their dead fellow villagers! The staff of the Construction Department of Renmin University of China donated all of the more than two million yuan they had saved to the families of the victims. Many citizens sent books, towels, cloth, socks, soap and other condolence gifts. The People's Printing Factory alone sent more than 1,300 books, five dozen towels, and thirty bars of soap.
