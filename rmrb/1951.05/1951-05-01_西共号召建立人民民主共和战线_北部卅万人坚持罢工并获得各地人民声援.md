Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: TASS, Paris, April 28th dispatch: The Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party issued a letter to the Spanish people, calling on the working class, middle class, petty bourgeoisie, industrialists and merchants, soldiers and civilians, Christians and atheists to unite immediately and form a People's Democratic Republican Front to defend their fundamental interests and the survival of Spain, which is threatened by the Franco group's war policies.

The appeal concludes: "The Spanish people reject the destiny planned for them by Franco and his American masters."

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Paris dispatch: The large-scale strike of 300,000 workers in the two northern provinces of Spain continues. As of the 27th, more workers had joined the strike movement.

The working people of San Sebastian and Bilbao continue to hold rallies in support of the strike, demanding the release of their arrested comrades. In San Sebastian, more shop employees have joined the industrial workers' strike. To protest the fascist authorities' arrest of workers, workers in some factories in the cities of Pasajes, Zarauz, and Lasarte in the province of Vizcaya have also joined the strike.

At the same time, workers in Catalonia who went on strike previously have resumed their strike after the capitalists refused to fulfill their promise to increase wages when resolving the strike. The strike of textile workers in Manresa, near Barcelona, has persisted for fourteen days as of the 27th, and Franco has ordered the closure of forty-seven textile factories.

Due to the seriousness of the situation, the Franco fascist government has had to send Minister of Labor Giron himself to San Sebastian to consult with local provincial authorities on countermeasures. The governors of Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa provinces are also attempting to sabotage the strike by deceptive means, expressing their willingness to "negotiate" and falsely claiming that the authorities would release the arrested workers if the striking workers resumed work.

The new strike movement in Spain has important political significance, even the reactionary British newspapers, the *Daily Express* and the *Daily Mail*, admit this fact. The *Daily Express*'s Madrid correspondent pointed out in a report that the striking workers "have inflicted the most serious defeat on General Franco and his regime in twelve years of power." The reporter also predicted that "in the coming weeks, Franco may face the most serious test." The *Daily Mail*'s reporter, Clifford, also wrote melancholically: "Something very unusual has happened in Spain. The carefully decorated surface of Spanish life has been shattered twice in two months."

　　西共号召建立人民民主共和战线
    北部卅万人坚持罢工并获得各地人民声援
    【新华社四月二十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十八日消息：西班牙共产党中央委员会发表告西班牙人民书，号召工人阶级、中等阶级、小资产阶级、工业家和商人、军人和平民、基督教徒和无神论者一致团结起来，马上组成人民民主共和战线，以保卫他们的根本利益，保卫由于佛朗哥集团的战争政策而受到威胁的西班牙生存。
    号召最后说：“西班牙人民拒绝佛朗哥及其美国主子为他们策划的命运。”
    【新华社四月二十九日讯】巴黎消息：西班牙北部两省三十万工人的大罢工在继续中，截至二十七日为止，又有更多的工人参加了罢工运动。
    圣塞巴斯提安和毕尔巴鄂两城的劳动人民，继续举行声援罢工，要求释放他们被捕的伙伴。在圣塞巴斯提安，已有更多的商店职工参加了产业工人的罢工。为了抗议法西斯当局逮捕工人，维兹加雅省的帕萨赫斯、萨劳斯与拉斯特莱斯城一些工厂的工人也参加了罢工。
    与此同时，加泰罗尼亚上次罢工的工人，在资方拒绝履行解决罢工时所作增加工资的诺言后又恢复了罢工。巴塞罗那附近曼里萨的纺织工人的罢工，到二十七日为止已坚持了十四天，佛朗哥已下令封闭了四十七所纺织工厂。
    由于形势严重，佛朗哥法西斯政府已不得不派出劳工部长希隆亲自前往圣塞巴斯提安，与当地省政当局会商对策。维兹加雅及吉普斯柯亚两省省长并企图借诡谲办法破坏罢工，他们表示愿意“谈判”，并欺骗说，如罢工工人复工，当局即可释放被捕工人。
    西班牙新的罢工运动具有重要的政治意义，甚至连英国的反动报《每日快报》和《每日邮报》也承认这个事实。《每日快报》驻马德里记者在报道中指出，罢工工人“已使佛朗哥将军及其政权遭受了当政十二年以来最严重的一次失败”，该记者并预言“在今后数周内，佛朗哥可能遭遇最严重的考验”。《每日邮报》的记者克立福德也忧郁地写道：“在西班牙发生了某种很不平常的事。小心翼翼地粉饰的西班牙生活的表面，在两个月内已经被打碎过两次了。”
