Based on the report by Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, at the 9th meeting of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, it is stated that significant achievements have been made nationwide in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and promoting the construction of democratic power over the past year. In the future, it is necessary to further improve the convening of people's representative conferences (or people's congresses) at all levels, which are sufficient to unite people from all walks of life to carry out work together, on the basis of existing work. To this end, the Council hereby issues the following instructions:

    I. People's governments at all levels must, in accordance with the provisions of the organizational rules of people's representative conferences at all levels, convene people's representative conferences at all levels on schedule. Among them, large cities must hold at least three meetings each year, and counties must hold at least two meetings each year. In addition, short temporary meetings should be convened to solve specific problems.

    Meetings of the people's government committees at all levels and their administrative meetings shall also establish a regular meeting system in accordance with the provisions of the organizational rules of the people's governments at all levels.

    II. All major tasks of the people's governments at all levels should be reported to the people's representative conferences at the corresponding levels and discussed and reviewed at the representative conferences. All major issues shall be discussed and decided by the people's representative conferences.

    III. All county and municipal people's representative conferences that have not yet exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress should actively create conditions to quickly exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress.

    IV. Cities with a population of more than 100,000 should, in accordance with the organizational rules, universally convene people's representative conferences in districts and establish district-level people's governments within this year.

    V. In areas where land reform has been completed, the administrative divisions of districts and townships (administrative villages) should be adjusted as appropriate to reduce the administrative scope of districts and townships, so as to facilitate the people's management of political power, strengthen the ties between the government and the masses, give full play to the role of grassroots organizations of people's power, and improve administrative efficiency.

    VI. People's governments at all levels in areas inhabited by minority nationalities should conscientiously promote national regional autonomy in accordance with the specific local conditions and establish national autonomous organs in a timely manner.

    VII. People's governments at all levels should instruct their subordinate civil affairs departments to pay attention to inspecting and supervising the subordinate people's governments to convene people's representative conferences on schedule, and to conduct regular inspections and report the situation to the higher levels on a regular basis.

    The civil affairs departments of major administrative regions and centrally-administered municipalities should report the above-mentioned situations to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government in two installments, by the end of May and the end of October this year.

    一、各级人民政府必须依照各级人民代表会议组织通则的规定，按期召开各级人民代表会议，其中大城市每年至少须开会三次，县至少须开会两次。此外，为了解决某一个专门的问题，并应召开简短的临时会议。
    各级人民政府委员会会议及其行政会议，亦应按照各级人民政府组织通则的规定，建立经常的会议制度。
    二、各级人民政府的一切重大工作，应向各该级人民代表会议提出报告，并在代表会议上进行讨论与审查。一切重大问题应经人民代表会议讨论并作出决定。
    三、凡尚未代行人民代表大会职权的县、市各界人民代表会议，应积极创造条件，以便迅速代行人民代表大会的职权。
    四、十万人口以上的城市，应按照组织通则，于今年内普遍召开区的人民代表会议，并成立区级人民政府。
    五、已完成土地改革的地区，应酌量调整区、乡（行政村）行政区划，缩小区、乡行政范围，以便利人民管理政权，密切政府与人民群众的联系，充分发挥人民政权的基层组织的作用，并提高行政效率。
    六、少数民族聚居地区的各级人民政府，应根据当地具体情况，认真地推行民族区域自治，适时地建立民族自治机构。
    七、各级人民政府应责成所属民政部门注意检查督促所属下级人民政府，按期召开各界人民代表会议，并经常加以检查，将情况定期报告上级。
    各大行政区及中央直属省、市民政部门，应将上述各项情况于今年五月底十月底分两次报告中央人民政府内务部。
