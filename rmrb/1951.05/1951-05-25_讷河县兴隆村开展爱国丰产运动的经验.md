Experiences of Xinglong Village, Nehe County, in Carrying Out the Patriotic Production Increase Movement
Yang Yingjie, Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government

Editor's Note: In order to deeply promote the patriotic production increase movement in rural areas, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government conducted a pilot project in Xinglong Village, Nehe County, in late April. This article is a summary of this work, providing a systematic explanation of how to carry out the patriotic production increase movement in rural areas. It is provided for reference by all localities.

So far, the patriotic production increase movement in rural Heilongjiang Province has mainly been manifested in the response of some provincial model labor groups to the challenges of the Li Shunda group in Shanxi and the Han En group in Jilin, as well as the challenges and responses between some provincial and county model labor groups. To truly carry out this movement among the groups in a village or a small village is currently limited to a few counties and districts. Most counties and districts are still in the pilot and initial stages, and some places have not yet begun. In order to ensure that this movement is truly and deeply implemented in the villages and groups in rural areas, we selected Xinglong Village, a medium-sized village in Nehe County, from April 21st to 28th, for a pilot project and gained some experience. Now, we are introducing it for reference by all localities.

(1) Understanding the Situation and Preparing for Deliberation

To carry out the patriotic production increase movement in rural areas, it is necessary to start from the specific circumstances of each rural area. Therefore, upon arriving in the village, we worked with the CCP branch and the village government to visit each farmer and group, and participated in branch meetings and village cadre meetings, focusing on understanding the following situations: (A) General Overview. The village has 2,440 hectares of land, a population of 1,849, 448 households, 344 male laborers, 186 female laborers, and 379 horsepower, indicating sufficient labor and horsepower. There are seven natural villages, of which four (namely, Xinmin Village, Fengyuan Village, Dongfeng Farm Village, and Xingfa Village) are doing well, and three (namely, Xifeng Farm Village, Wanfa Village, and Tong'an Village) are doing poorly. The fifteen CCP members are generally active in their work. The village government leadership is also sound. Cadres are able to take responsibility, and the heads of each small village can also take responsibility, but they do not fully understand the patriotic production increase movement. (B) Production Situation. Before the spring plowing, seeds, grain, and horse feed are generally prepared, with only a few households not fully prepared. Farmers have a high level of enthusiasm for production, with some starting to collect and transport manure as early as the first month of the lunar year. On the fourth day of the first month, the village, mainly Xinmin Village, held a germination and trial planting exhibition, launching a seed selection and trial planting campaign. This year, most of the village's wheat is disinfected with Wangtong. (C) Ideological Concerns. Currently, the masses still have some concerns. One is a lack of clear understanding of the current situation; the other is the fear of increasing the burden of public grain due to setting increased production targets, which is one of the important reasons hindering the patriotic production increase movement. The district and village cadres have a poor understanding of how to launch the patriotic competition movement in their village and have not provided good leadership, thus failing to form a movement. (D) Production Group (Mutual Aid Group) Situation. There are a total of 74 groups in the village. Among these groups, there is the relatively well-established Zhang Diancai group, a provincial model worker group. Thirty-three groups have production plans, but a large portion of these plans are not realistic. Some groups do not yet have leaders.

Based on the above situation, we helped the village branch and the village government to conduct deliberation and preparation among the masses. (A) Ideological Preparation. This means publicizing the relationship between patriotism and production, the significance of the patriotic production increase movement, explaining the public grain burden policy, and the benefits of producing more marketable grain at any time and any place. (B) Organizational Preparation. Helping the village branch and the village government to re-examine and approve the village's production plan (because the village had a production plan that had not been discussed in the village and was somewhat impractical), and prepare for a successful village people's representative meeting, etc. (C) Production Group Preparation. Helping each small village to develop or revise the plans of two or three better production groups to prepare for challenges and responses, especially helping the Zhang Diancai group to review their plan and prepare to challenge the entire village.

(2) Explaining the Principles and Dispelling Concerns

Before, after, and during the village people's representative meeting, we focused on clarifying: (A) About the current life and current concerns. Using concrete examples familiar to farmers, explain that current life is much stronger and much better than it was during the puppet Manchukuo era, and this is just the beginning. Therefore, we should love our current life, love the people's motherland, actively resist America and aid Korea, and oppose the aggression of American imperialism. On the other hand, it should be explained that there are still many shortcomings in current production and life. Therefore, we must vigorously develop production, launch a patriotic production increase movement, and strive for a bumper harvest this year in order to produce more grain and increase income. (B) About the purpose and methods of the patriotic production increase movement. Emphasize clarifying that the purpose of this movement is to produce more grain and increase national defense strength. How can this goal be achieved? This requires improving technology, combining sideline occupations, mobilizing women to participate in production, and improving group leadership. So-called improving technology means selecting seeds, applying manure and fertilizer, cultivating and weeding more frequently, and using new-style farm tools. The so-called "competition" movement mainly takes place between groups within the village and within the village. The condition is to complete the production plan of the group, summarize it once every season, and the winner can get a red flag. Use this method to stir up production enthusiasm, improve production, complete the plan, and strive for a bumper harvest.

(3) Cultivating Model Groups and Improving the Majority

The patriotic production competition movement is mainly carried out between groups in the village. Therefore, there must be a specific good example, a model group, in the village. Otherwise, although there are famous model laborers outside the village, they are far away and the conditions are high, and the general group cannot compete with him. The village has paid attention to cultivating and helping the Zhang Diancai group in the past. The Zhang Diancai group is a group that has been organized, consolidated, and developed since 1948. The group leader, Zhang Diancai, came from a hired peasant background, is fair, responds to the government's call first, and can study technology. His production plan this year is also relatively good, paying particular attention to farming methods. Therefore, strengthening the cultivation and help for the Zhang Diancai group can drive the entire village forward. On the other hand, our goal is to improve the majority of groups so that they can all improve a step in the patriotic production increase movement. Because they are the majority, they have a decisive role in the patriotic production increase movement. Many places have only paid attention to provincial and county model labor groups (of course, this should be given special attention), while neglecting and abandoning the improvement and leadership of the majority of production groups. This is obviously wrong.

(4) Launching a Competition Movement Through the People's Representative Meeting

The central task of rural areas year-round is production, and the patriotic production increase movement should be discussed and arranged through the village people's representative meeting.

This village people's representative meeting was held on April 26. Full preparations were made in advance, absorbing the participation of the village production team leaders and women representatives. Zhang Fengqi, the secretary of the CCP branch of Gonghe Village, and Wang Yugui, a provincial model worker, were also invited to participate, totaling 120 people. The meeting had two contents: one was to discuss and approve the village's increased production plan (the village had previously reported a plan to the district, but it had not been discussed). This increased production plan stipulates a grain yield (natural grain) of 14,604 *shi*, an increase of 2,318 *shi* compared with the normal annual yield of 12,286 *shi*, that is, an increase of about 20%; an increase of 787 *shi* compared with the previous plan of 13,817 *shi* submitted to the district. And everyone unanimously believes that this plan is not high and has the confidence to guarantee its completion. This plan was proposed and revised by the village, and we only made a few suggestions. It can be seen that as long as the village is told the working methods, the village is able to formulate a practical plan. The second was to launch a village-wide patriotic production competition movement, challenge and respond. First, the provincial model worker Zhang Diancai reported on the group's plan and challenged the entire village. Then, each group responded to Zhang Diancai's challenge, because many of the better groups could reach Zhang Diancai's group's yield per hectare (except for seed collection fields). All of these were plans proposed based on the actual yields of the past few years. A total of more than ten groups in each small village challenged and responded, which was quite enthusiastic. Women representatives also challenged each other. At the meeting, the purpose and method of the patriotic production competition movement were clarified, concerns were dispelled, the competition was launched, and the enthusiasm for patriotic production was boosted.

(5) Taking Action and Implementing It

After the people's representative meeting was held, the village had the following manifestations:

(A) Further elimination of concerns and encouragement of enthusiasm. At the symposiums in the villages, the farmers compared the lives of the puppet Manchukuo era and the present, understood the relationship between patriotism and production, the people and the government, and the enthusiasm for patriotic production generally increased.

(B) Rectifying groups and re-establishing increased production plans. The plans originally established by the Xia Deming and Zhao Guangtian groups were not realistic. After being pointed out, they said, "I knew that plan was a lie with my eyes open." So they re-established the plan. In the past, seven of the thirteen groups in Tong'an Village had no leaders. Now, leaders have been elected. And a women's group led by Sun Baozhen was established and a practical plan was established.

(C) The masses immediately took action after the meeting. The call made at the meeting for each laborer to accumulate 1.5 *mu* of manure more has become the actual action of the masses. Many people in each small village are cleaning the bottom of manure piles, ditches, and large pits, and accumulating small amounts of ash.

(6) Inspection and Summary are Necessary

After the movement is launched, timely and regular inspections and summaries are needed to ensure that the movement continues to develop and achieve its goals. Timely inspection, discovery, and dissemination of new experiences, prevention of deviations. Regular inspection and summary, decision to conduct three major inspections and summaries after the planting of the large fields, after cultivation and weeding, and after the autumn harvest, to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages, summarize experiences, and issue red flags (which can be produced and issued by the district and county). To this end, a inspection and evaluation committee was established with the participation of district cadres. This point must be done, otherwise it will be without a head and without a tail, or a tiger's head and snake's tail, and the purpose of the patriotic production competition movement cannot be achieved.

　　讷河县兴隆村开展爱国丰产运动的经验
    黑龙江省人民政府副主席  杨英杰
    编者按：黑龙江省人民政府为了在农村中深入开展爱国丰产运动，于四月下旬在讷河县兴隆村进行了试点工作。本文是这次工作的总结，对于如何在农村开展爱国丰产运动，作了系统说明。特提供各地参考。
    黑龙江省农村中的爱国丰产运动，到目前为止，主要表现为一部分省劳动模范小组响应山西李顺达小组及吉林韩恩小组的挑战，以及一部分省县劳动模范小组间的挑战应战。而切实地使这一运动在一个村一个屯的小组间开展起来，目前还只是少数县区，多数县区还是在试点与开始的阶段，有些地方尚未开始。为了使这一运动切实地深入地贯彻到农村中的村、屯小组中去，我们从四月二十一日到二十八日，选择了讷河县一个上中等村——兴隆村，进行了一段试点工作，取得一些经验。现在介绍出来供各地参考。
            （一）了解情况，准备酝酿
    在农村中开展爱国丰产运动，必须从每个农村的具体情况出发。因此，我们到村中首先协同中共支部、村政府，去访问每一农户、小组，并参加支部会与村干部会议，着重了解了以下情况：（甲）一般概况。全村土地二千四百四十垧，人口一千八百四十九名，户数四百四十八户，男劳动力三百四十四个，女劳动力一百八十六个，马力三百七十九匹，劳动力与马力够用。有七个自然屯，其中四个屯（即新民屯、奉原屯、东丰农屯、兴发屯）工作较好，三个屯（即西丰农屯、万发屯、通安屯）工作较差。中共党员十五名，工作一般是积极的。村政府领导也还健全。干部能够负责，各小屯长也能负责，但对于爱国丰产运动不甚了解。（乙）生产情况。春耕前，种籽、粮食、马料等一般都准备好了，只有个别户准备不足。农民生产劲头较高，正月初就有刨粪送粪的。正月初四，该村以新民屯为主，召开了发芽试种展览会，展开了选种试种运动，今年全村小麦大部分都用王铜消毒。（丙）思想顾虑。目前群众仍有一些顾虑，其一是对于时局认识不清楚；其二是怕订增产计划因而加重公粮负担，这是阻碍爱国丰产运动的重要原因之一。区村干部对于如何在本村展开爱国竞赛运动，认识既差，又未很好领导，因此，未能形成运动。（丁）生产小组（互助组）情况。全村共有小组七十四个，这些小组中有比较健全的省劳动模范张殿才组。有生产计划的小组共三十三个，其中一大部分计划不实在。有些小组尚无组长。
    根据以上情况，我们帮助村支部和村政府在群众中进行了酝酿和准备。（甲）思想准备。这就是随时随地宣传爱国与生产的关系，宣传爱国丰产运动的意义，解释公粮负担政策，和多种商品粮好处等。（乙）组织准备。帮助村支部和村政府，重新审订全村生产计划（因为村中有个生产计划，未经过村中讨论，且有些不实际），准备开好村人民代表会议等。（丙）生产小组准备。帮助每一小屯订出或修改两三个较好生产小组的计划，准备挑战应战，特别是帮助张殿才组审订计划，准备向全村挑战。
            （二）讲清道理，打消顾虑
    在村人民代表会议前、会议后，以及在会议上，都着重讲清：（甲）关于现在的生活，现在的顾虑。用农民所熟悉的具体事例，说明现在生活比之伪满时代强的多，好的多，而且这还只是开头；因此，我们应当热爱现在的生活，热爱人民的祖国，积极抗美援朝，反对美帝国主义的侵略。另一方面，说明现在生产、生活都还有许多不足，因此，就要大力发展生产，展开爱国主义丰产运动，争取今年丰收，以便多打粮食，增加收入。（乙）关于爱国丰产运动的目的和作法。强调讲清这个运动的目的是多打粮食，增加国防力量；怎样才能达到这个目的呢？这就须要提高技术，结合副业，发动妇女参加生产，提高小组领导等。所谓提高技术，就是选种，上粪施肥，多铲多趟，使用新式农具等。所谓“竞赛”运动，主要是在本村本屯内的小组与小组间。其条件是完成本组的生产计划，每季总结一次，优胜者可得红旗，用这种办法，鼓起生产热情，提高生产，完成计划，争取丰收。
            （三）培养典型组，提高大多数
    爱国丰产竞赛运动，主要是在村内组与组之间展开，因此，必须在本村内有个具体的好样子，有个典型组，不然，村外虽有著名劳动模范，但离得远，条件高，一般小组没法和他比赛。村里对于张殿才组，过去是注意培养和帮助的。张殿才组是一九四八年组织起来，一直巩固和发展的小组。组长张殿才是雇农出身，为人公正，对于政府的号召首先响应，又能钻研技术。他今年生产计划也比较好，特别讲究耕作方法。因此，加强对于张殿才组的培养和帮助，可以带动全村前进。另一方面，我们的目的是要提高大多数小组，使他们都能在爱国丰产运动中提高一步。因为他们是大多数，对于爱国丰产运动是有决定性的作用。许多地方只注意了省县劳动模范组（当然这应当特别注意），而忽视了放弃了对于大多数生产小组的提高与领导，这显然是不对的。
            （四）通过人民代表会议，展开竞赛运动
    农村常年中心工作就是生产，爱国丰产运动应当经过村人民代表会议来讨论布置。
    这次村人民代表会议于四月二十六日召开，事先作了充分准备，吸收全村生产组长、妇女代表参加，又请来共和村中共支部书记张凤岐和省劳动模范王玉贵参加，共到一百二十人。会议内容有二：一是讨论和通过全村增产计划（过去村曾向区报过一个计划，但未经过讨论）。这次增产计划规定产粮（自然粮）一万四千六百零四石，较常年产量一万二千二百八十六石增产二千三百一十八石，即增产约为百分之二十；较前次送区计划一万三千八百一十七石，增加七百八十七石。而且大家一致认为这次计划不高，有信心保证完成。这个计划是村里提出订正的，我们只提了很少意见，可见只要告诉村里工作方法，村里是能够订出合乎实际的计划的。二是展开全村爱国丰产竞赛运动，挑战应战。先由省劳动模范张殿才报告小组计划，向全村挑战。接着是各组和张殿才应战，因为张殿才组每垧产量（除采种田外），有许多较好小组都可以达到，其中都是根据几年来实际产量提出的计划。各小屯挑战应战小组一共有十多个，颇为热烈。妇女代表也互相挑战。在会议上弄清了爱国丰产竞赛运动的目的和作法，打消了顾虑，展开了竞赛，鼓舞起爱国生产热情。
            （五）行动起来，贯彻下去
    开过人民代表会议以后，村中有以下表现：
    （甲）进一步消除顾虑，鼓舞起热情。农民们在各小屯的座谈会上，对比伪满和现在的生活，弄通爱国和生产、人民和政府的关系，爱国丰产热情普遍高涨。
    （乙）整顿小组，重订增产计划。开初夏德明、赵广田小组订的计划不实在，在被指出后，他们说：“那个计划，自己明知是瞪着眼睛说瞎话。”于是重订了计划。过去通安屯十三个小组，有七个组没组长，现在选举了组长。而且成立了一个妇女孙宝珍小组，订了切合实际的计划。
    （丙）群众在会议后立即行动起来，会上提出的每个劳动力再多积一点五亩地粪的号召，已成为群众的实际行动，各小屯都有许多人打扫粪堆底子、壕沟、大坑底子，攒小灰。
            （六）要检查总结
    运动展开后，需要及时的和定期的检查总结，才能保证运动不断向前发展和达到目的。及时检查，发现和传播新的经验，防止偏差。定期检查总结，决定在种完大田，铲趟完了及秋收完了，分三次大检查总结，评定优劣，总结经验，发给红旗（可由区县制作发给）。为此，成立检查评奖委员会，有区干部参加。这一条一定要作，否则就会有头无尾，或虎头蛇尾，爱国丰产竞赛运动的目的就不能达到。
