Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

　　To the Editors:

　　We fully accept Comrade Gao Jier's criticism of the Liaoyang Telephone Bureau in the "Letters from Readers" column of your newspaper on April 30th. This gives us great inspiration for improving our work in the future. In addition to educating the personnel involved, we now submit the results of our investigation and our self-criticism to you.

　　When connecting long-distance calls, some of our staff members are careless. When the Liaoyang Wholesale Station of the State-owned Trading Company was making a call to Shenyang, we miscalculated the number of calls. Although we discovered and corrected it later, we failed to humbly admit our mistake at the time, and instead emphasized objective reasons. The phenomena of wrong connections and slow disconnections also occur frequently. This is because there are many new operators with low technical skills. When there are many user calls, they become flustered due to unfamiliarity with the numbers, and some even violate the regulations and leave their posts without permission.

　　The fundamental reason for the above shortcomings is, first of all, that the leadership's thinking is that user complaints are inevitable with manual telephones, so they cannot face up to the shortcomings and actively strive to overcome difficulties and improve work. Secondly, the leadership lacks in-depth inspection of the work, so good work experiences cannot be discovered and promoted in a timely manner, and there is a lack of specific leadership.

　　Now we are preparing to learn from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang team, educate and inspire everyone to overcome all difficulties, strengthen political and professional studies, and improve work efficiency. We will also plan to solicit opinions from telephone users once a quarter as a reference for our inspection and improvement work.

　　Through this inspection work, we have discovered many problems in our work, and we are now further resolving these problems in order to improve telecommunications work.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Liaoyang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau

### 辽阳邮电局接受读者批评检查改进工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　辽阳邮电局接受读者批评检查改进工作编辑同志：
    四月三十日贵报《读者来信》栏高基尔同志对辽阳电话局的批评，我们完全接受。这对我们今后改进工作给予很大的启示。我们除对有关人员进行教育外，现将检查结果和我们的检讨写给你们。
    我们在挂长途电话时，个别人员粗心大意。国营贸易公司辽阳批发站与沈阳通话时，我们误计次数，后虽发觉订正，但当时不能虚心承认错误，反而强调客观原因。接错电话和接撤线慢的现象也是时常发生的。这是由于新话务员多，技术低，碰到用户电话多时，就发生因号码不熟而手忙脚乱现象，且有个别违犯制度擅离岗位的。
    产生以上缺点的基本原因，首先是领导思想上认为人工电话，用户有意见总是难免，因而不能正视缺点，积极主动地努力克服困难，改进工作。其次是领导上对工作缺乏深入检查，因而好的工作经验不能及时发现推广，缺乏具体领导。
    现在我们准备通过学习马恒昌小组先进经验，教育与启发大家克服一切困难，加强政治业务学习，提高工作效率。我们并将有计划地每季度征求一次电话用户意见，做为我们检查与改进工作的借鉴。
    我们经过这次检查工作，发现工作中很多问题，现正进一步解决这些问题，为提高电讯工作而努力。
                辽阳邮电局
