　　To safeguard the welfare of fishermen and assist in the restoration and development of fishery production, the People's Insurance Company of China has decided to launch fishery insurance in major fishing areas across the country. The company piloted this insurance business in the Tangda District of Tianjin. Within one month, more than 700 fishing sailboats have been insured for hull insurance, accounting for 80 percent of all fishing boats in the area. The fishery insurance offered by the People's Insurance Company of China is divided into two types: fishing boat hull insurance (including major rigging and fishing gear) and group personal accident insurance for fishermen. To reduce the burden on fishermen, insurance rates are generally set very low. The annual rate for fishing sailboat hull insurance in the Tangda District is 5 percent, and the monthly rate for group personal accident insurance for fishermen is 0.3 percent.

　　人民保险公司举办渔业保险
    中国人民保险公司为了保障渔民福利，协助恢复和发展渔业生产，决定在全国各主要渔区举办渔业保险。该公司在天津市塘大区试办这种保险业务，一个月中，已有七百余艘渔帆船投保了船舶险，占当地全部渔船的百分之八十。中国人民保险公司举办的渔业保险，分为渔船船舶保险（包括主要船具及渔具）及渔工团体人身保险两种。为了减轻渔民负担，保险费率一般都定得很低。塘大区渔帆船船舶险年率为百分之五，渔工团体人身险月率为千分之三。
