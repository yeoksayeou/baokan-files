　　Fuzhou Match Industry Strengthens Joint Operation Organization
　　All Factories Achieve Income and Expenditure Balance, Production and Sales Equilibrium

　　The joint operation organization of the private match industry in Fuzhou City, after being reorganized with the assistance of the Municipal People's Government and helped to solve difficulties at the beginning of this year, has put the production and sales of the entire industry on the right track. After the liberation of Fuzhou in August 1949, the number of match factories increased from one to eleven. Each factory blindly competed in production and sales, resulting in serious product backlog. In June of last year, the factories officially established a joint operation. However, the factories did not realize that joint operation must be combined with the transformation of the enterprises themselves. Therefore, the joint operation organization gradually lost its function. In January of this year, the Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau allocated the total production task to the joint operation office through democratic consultation and assisted them in formulating production plans, production covenants, joint operation covenants and other plans. The trading company sold the accumulated products of each factory on a monthly basis according to the production and sales plans of each factory. Later, a "Match Finished Product Inspection and Pricing Committee" was established, unifying product specifications, reducing raw material waste, and lowering costs. Under the mobilization and education of the Construction Bureau, the private views among the factories were gradually eliminated. The joint operation office began to set up sales offices to uniformly handle the sales of finished products. In this way, the prices of the sales offices and the agents were unified, and the listed prices of the trading companies and the market prices also tended to be consistent. At the same time, the management and sales costs of each factory were also saved. At present, the inventory of the match industry has been sold out, and the accumulated wages have been paid off. All factories have achieved income and expenditure balance and production and sales equilibrium. Jianhua Match Factory had a surplus in March.

　　Jiangxi Spring Industrial and Commercial Tax Mostly Entered into the Treasury

　　The spring industrial and commercial tax of Jiangxi Province, except for a small amount of arrears in the three cities of Nanchang, Ji'an, and Ganzhou, has been fully entered into the treasury in all other counties and cities. Industrial and commercial households in twenty-nine cities including Dongxiang, Fengcheng, Jingdezhen, Shangrao, and Gao'an have completed their tax payment tasks ahead of schedule. Industrial and commercial households in Dongxiang paid off the spring industrial and commercial tax within four hours. It only took forty minutes for industrial and commercial households in Hengfeng to pay off all taxes.

　　Workers in Wuhan Raise Production Enthusiasm During the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

　　In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, factories in Wuhan City have improved the consciousness of the working class and strengthened trade union work. Since late March, factories in Wuhan City have generally carried out the study of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" and launched a movement to recall, accuse, and expose counter-revolutionary elements. The political awareness of the employees has been further improved, and the enthusiasm for production has been further increased. After a factory-wide accusation meeting at a certain automobile repair factory, the enthusiasm of all employees was high, and the labor competition that had been suspended for four or five months was restarted. Due to the improvement of workers' awareness, trade union work has also been strengthened. In the past, trade union group meetings could not be held frequently, and even if they were held, there was no content. Now, group criticism meetings have been generally established, and some group meetings can discuss issues such as unity, learning, and production, or conduct criticism and self-criticism.

　　Jiawang Coal Mine Did Not Vigorously Mobilize the Masses to Participate in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries

　　In March and April, the Public Security Bureau of Tongshan County People's Government of Shandong Province arrested and shot several counter-revolutionary elements hiding in the Jiawang Coal Mine. The workers hated these counter-revolutionary elements to the extreme. When they were arrested, all the workers who knew about it reflected that they should have been arrested long ago. However, in this work, the mine leaders never carried out in-depth education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries among the employees; nor did they organize workers to make accusations. Therefore, many workers underground still do not know who has been arrested; some workers heard that Zhang Wenbing, the big feudal foreman and secret service chief of the mine, was shot and said: "Why didn't they call us to participate in the public trial? We still have a lot of suffering that we haven't complained about!" At the same time, due to the lack of education, workers do not know enough about the crimes of certain secret agents. This fully proves that the mine leaders' understanding of the spirit of vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries is not enough.

    福州市火柴业加强联营组织
    各厂做到收支相抵产销平衡
    福州市私营火柴业的联营组织，今年初，经市人民政府协助整理并帮助解决困难后，整个行业的产销已走上正轨。一九四九年八月福州解放后，火柴业由一家增至十一家，各厂盲目竞产竞销，产品滞销情况严重，去年六月各厂正式成立联营。但各厂并未认识到联营必须与企业本身的改造相结合，因此联营组织逐渐失去作用。今年一月，市人民政府建设局以民主协商方式分配给联营处以生产总任务，并协助他们制订生产计划、生产公约、联营公约等方案。各厂积存的产品，贸易公司就各厂产销计划，分月匀售。以后并成立“火柴成品检验议价委员会”，统一了产品规格，减少了原料浪费，降低了成本。在建设局的动员教育下，各厂间的私见逐步消除。联营处开始设立门市部，统一办理成品销售。这样门市部与各代理商价格划一，贸易公司牌价与市场价格也趋一致，同时还节省了各厂的管理及推销费用。目前，火柴业的存货已经售完，积压的工资已经发清。各厂都做到收支相抵产销平衡，建华火柴厂三月份已有盈余。

    江西春季工商业税大部入库
    江西省春季工商业税除南昌、吉安、赣州三城市还有少数尾欠外，其余各县、市已全部入库。东乡、丰城、景德镇、上饶、高安等二十九个城市的工商业者都提前完成纳税任务。东乡工商业户在四小时内缴清春季工商业税。横峰工商业户缴清全部税款只费时四十分钟。
    在镇压反革命运动中武汉工人生产热情提高
    武汉市各工厂在镇压反革命运动中，提高了工人阶级觉悟，加强了工会工作。三月下旬以后，武汉市各厂普遍进行了《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》的学习，展开了回忆、控诉、检举反革命分子运动。职工的政治认识进一步提高，生产热情更形高涨。某汽车修理厂经过全厂控诉大会以后，全厂职工情绪高涨，停顿四、五个月的劳动竞赛又重新搞起来了。由于工人觉悟的提高，也加强了工会工作。过去工会小组会经常开不起来，开起来也没有内容。现在小组检讨会普遍建立起来，有的小组会上并能围绕着团结、学习、生产等问题进行讨论，或进行批评与自我批评。
    贾汪煤矿在镇压反革命时没有大张旗鼓发动群众参加
    三、四月间，山东铜山县人民政府公安局先后逮捕和枪决了几个隐藏在贾汪煤矿的反革命分子。工人对这些反革命分子痛恨到极点，当逮捕后，凡知道的工人都反映早就该捕了。但是，在这一工作中，该矿领导上始终未在职工中深入进行镇压反革命的教育；也未组织工人进行控诉。因此，井下许多工人还不晓得谁被逮捕了；有的工人听到该矿大封建把头、特务头子张文炳被枪决的消息后说：“为什么不叫我们参加公审，我们还有很多苦没诉出来呢！”同时，由于缺乏教育，工人对某些特务的罪恶尚不够了解。这充分证明：该矿领导对镇压反革命必须大张旗鼓的精神体会还很不够。
