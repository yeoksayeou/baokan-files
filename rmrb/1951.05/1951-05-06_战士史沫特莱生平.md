　　The Life of the Warrior Agnes Smedley
    Ding Ling

    Under the fascist rule of American imperialism, it is not easy to maintain the fighting qualities and spirit of loving peace, loving truth, being incorruptible by wealth, and unyielding to force. As far as I can see, Agnes Smedley can be said to be one of such figures. She was an outstanding daughter of the American people and a loyal friend of the Chinese people.

    Agnes Smedley was an American, the daughter of a transport worker in a mine. From an early age, she sought freedom, the liberation of the working people, and truth. She gained knowledge, approached revolutionaries, and visited the Soviet Union. She understood that there were two camps in the world: one was the revolutionary, just camp of the working people of the world, and the other was the reactionary, war-mongering, imperialist fascist camp. And she herself chose the former camp. From this starting point, she came to China. From the day she approached the Chinese people and the Chinese revolutionary movement, for more than twenty years, she never changed her attitude. She loved the Chinese people, loved the Chinese revolution, and loved the Chinese people's army and its leaders. She dedicated all her strength to her ideals. She was a true American who represented the American people. She was a friend of the Chinese people. We will always remember the work she did for us, respect her unyielding struggle against American imperialism, sympathize with her experiences, and deeply mourn her death.

    Her childhood was very unfortunate. From a very young age, she made a living by working, taking care of children, washing clothes, and working as a maid, etc. The work was very tiring, the wages were very low, and often the whole family had no food to eat throughout the winter, only tomato and potato soup. Agnes Smedley described in her autobiographical novel "Daughter of Earth": "Happiness can only be found where I am not."

    Agnes Smedley desperately cut back on everything necessary for her life, and went to learn typing and shorthand at night. She continued to study and completed her university graduation. For the sake of survival and for her family, she waged a difficult struggle against American capitalist society with her young life. This period paved the way for her lifelong struggle, enabled her to approach revolutionary theory early, made her enthusiastic about the revolutionary cause for life, and enabled her to resist the persecution of American imperialists for many years with her sick body. Although she was eventually strangled by them, she never retreated or stopped, and was always so brave and strong.

    She approached revolutionary theory from getting to know several Indian scholars who were exiled in the United States. Agnes Smedley listened to their speeches, made friends with them, helped them in their activities, protected them, and was once implicated and imprisoned for several months. After being released from prison, she became more closely associated with them, and her activities became more active. She was imprisoned a second time, and after being released, she left the United States and went to Berlin. At that time, Berlin was the center of gathering for Indian revolutionaries, and progressive Indians all knew Agnes Smedley.

    While Agnes Smedley was recuperating in Denmark, she wrote her autobiographical novel: "Daughter of Earth." From this book, one can understand the feelings and actions of a rebel. She poured all her enthusiasm into this creation. The book caused a sensation and was translated into German, Danish, Japanese, French, Chinese, and other languages.

    She came to China in 1928. Her motive was definitely not for this ancient and mysterious country in the East that Europeans and Americans thought it was, nor was it for "China, the paradise of adventurers." She came because China was an oppressed nation. She had understood the suffering of colonial India, so she sympathized with the revolutionary movement in semi-colonial China. Especially after the Great Revolution, when Chiang Kai-shek's white terror was shrouding the land of China, she came to China, using the name of a reporter for the German Frankfurter Zeitung.

    In China, she went to the countryside to understand the lives of the peasants, and went to the factories to understand the lives of the workers. She had contacts with Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Feng Xuefeng, etc. (I also met her at this time). Later, she came into contact with the Chinese left-wing cultural circles, and thus understood the revolutionary demands of the Chinese people even more. Through these relationships, she collected some materials about the revolutionary movements of the Chinese Communist Red Army in Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and other places, and also talked with revolutionary workers who came to Shanghai from the red areas. These heroic revolutionary historical sites, the battles of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army blossomed brightly in her heart. She admired them, admired those brilliant achievements. She wrote reports, one after another, broadcasting to the world. Her "Chinese Red Army Marches On" was written at this time. Another book, "China's Destiny," was also written at this time. In this book, she clearly expressed her attitude towards the Chinese revolution.

    During this period in Shanghai, Agnes Smedley not only wrote articles herself, but also helped the left-wing cultural circles establish contact with international progressive organizations, such as the American magazine "New Masses," and founded and hosted the "China Forum." This publication was an anti-Chiang English publication at the time and had some influence. Agnes Smedley often published articles on it.

    She used various methods to unite foreigners in Shanghai, publicizing and raising donations to them, and organizing them to do transportation for revolutionary work and to protect certain revolutionary comrades. She often said to them, "Now that you understand the truth, you should think about what to do." She also mobilized some people to go to the red areas.

    She helped with the work of the Red Relief Society. She helped with the work of the Human Rights Protection League, which was presided over by Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Lu Xun, and Yang Xingfo at that time. She often worked all day long and did not rest late at night. All the Chinese and foreign friends who knew her were amazed at her energy and admired her enthusiasm.

    But the imperialists would not let her work well. Detectives from the police station guarded the door of her residence, and there were plainclothesmen tailing her when she went out. Someone was also eavesdropping on her phone calls. She did not shrink back at all, and went to the American embassy to protest. She scolded the secret agents "guarding" at her door. She thought of many ways to escape the eyes and ears of that group of dogs to carry out her activities.

    The Chinese reactionary literati Hu Shi and Ding Wenjiang hated her very much. Hu Shi proposed to sue her to the German Frankfurter Zeitung, saying that she was colluding with the Chinese Communist Party and wanted the newspaper to fire her, and threatened her with these words. This forced her to leave the newspaper and lose her status as a reporter. She was also sick, and for the sake of her illness, she had to return to the United States temporarily, the United States that she did not want to return to. She returned to China not long after she went back. This was the time when the Chinese people's national salvation movement was surging and the anti-Japanese national united front was expanding.

    In November 1936, she arrived in Xi'an. Xi'an was then the front line of "reaction." Chiang Kai-shek personally went to Xi'an to convene a military conference to suppress the patriotic movement. At this time, Zhang Xueliang, Yang Hucheng, and many generals from the Northeast and Northwest stationed in Xi'an were accepting the proposals of the Chinese Communist Party, uniting to resist Japan, and seeking the future of the united front. There were also many Communists in Xi'an, and there were also democratic parties working here. Agnes Smedley appeared particularly excited when she came into contact with such a complex and tense political scene. When Chiang Kai-shek was detained on December 12, she was simply overjoyed. She understood Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary nature, that he was a stubborn enemy of the Chinese people, and that he would never truly bow his head to the people, but she still could not fully understand the complexity of the Chinese revolution. For a time, she could not understand why Chiang Kai-shek was released again. But this incident prompted her to firmly demand to go to the Eighth Route Army, to go to Yan'an, the democratic holy land of China.

    She arrived at the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and met with Eighth Route Army generals Comrades Peng Dehuai, Ren Bishi, He Long, Guan Xiangying, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun… She seemed to have met family members she hadn't seen for a long time, and had endless words of love to say and asked all kinds of questions. In the midst of the busy rush of new things, new questions, and new feelings every day, she still did not leave her shorthand notebook and typewriter, and she kept writing articles and reports.

    In the spring of 1937, she arrived in Yan'an, lived in the city of Yan'an, and lived the life of ordinary cadres, which was very simple. At this time, she spent most of her time talking with Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. She was preparing to write a biography of Zhu De. In these conversations, she not only understood the great personality of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, but also understood the Chinese people and the Chinese Red Army even more. She loved China even more. In addition to writing articles and collecting materials, she often went to the hospital, participated in health conferences, and cared about medical issues. She also cared about women's work.

    When the July 7th Anti-Japanese War began, she followed the army to Taiyuan and arrived at the Wutai front line. Later, she followed the headquarters and transferred, passing through Taihang and stationed in a village near Linfen. This kind of marching was very hard. Agnes Smedley also took care of other comrades along the way. The comrades of the Northwest Battlefield Service Corps often received her care. When her orderly got sick, she took care of him like a mother.

    In 1938, she arrived in Wuhan. She often publicized the deeds of the Battle of Pingxingguan and the Battle of Yangmingbao to the masses, and exhibited the victory products obtained by the Eighth Route Army on the front line: coats, sabers, binoculars, leather bags, gas masks, etc. She raised donations, plus her own royalties, bought medicines, gloves, goggles… Only when she sent these things to the front line of the Eighth Route Army did she feel a little comforted. She also mobilized foreign reporters to go to the front line of the Eighth Route Army. Even a very famous Catholic bishop in Wuhan was influenced by her and sent his daughter to Linfen. These people had played some role. One of them worth mentioning is Carlson. Carlson was a good friend of hers, and under her influence, he also went to the front line of the Eighth Route Army and visited the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area. After returning, he enthusiastically told those who wanted to know about the Eighth Route Army what he had seen truthfully.

    She had also been to the New Fourth Army and tried to donate medicines to the front. She continued to write her third book: "China Fights Back" and her fourth book: "China's Battle Song." In these books, she had clear love and hate, surging enthusiasm, exposing the conspiracies of American imperialism against China, exposing the荒淫无耻 of Chiang Kai-shek's бандит group; praising the bravery and strength of the Eighth Route Army and the Chinese people, insisting on resisting Japan, forgetting private interests for the public, and the noble qualities of being unafraid of sacrifice for national liberation and revolutionary victory. Her books were widely welcomed by progressive people, and these books were translated into Russian, German, Chinese, and other languages.

    Her health was originally not good, and coupled with long-term stressful work, she had to return to the United States to recuperate. She wanted to write a biography of Zhu De while recuperating.

    After returning to China, she did not rest. Under extremely difficult economic conditions, she continued to publicize the Chinese revolution.

    Her enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause gave her great ability to act. Wherever she went, she could unite a group of people, making these people sympathize with her, sympathize with her work, and oppose American imperialism. Wherever she went, there was a sense of vitality. When she appeared, people became active. She often organized lectures and forums. When she went to the countryside, she organized female college students in a nearby university to invite Chinese revolutionaries in the United States to talk about Chinese issues and the vivid life of reality. Because she could see the newborn forces, she slowly developed into the most eloquent person. Her words were all full of agitation. Her writing was also very attractive and moving.

    At a debate, when the Chinese reactionary writer Lin Yutang made a speech to slander the Chinese people, she righteously scolded Lin Yutang at the time: "If I were you, I would simply have no place to live, and you are still a Chinese!"

    The American reactionary newspaper "Life" magazine wanted to rent her collection of photos about the activities of the Chinese Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army at a high price, and used sweet words to deceive her, but she did not give it. She answered very simply: "Can Life magazine do something beneficial to the Chinese people?"

    For a time, she lived in a sanatorium in the countryside and was engaged in writing the biography of Zhu De. There, the standard of living was more frugal. But because she often associated with some left-wing elements and went out to give speeches and broadcasts, etc., it aroused the sanatorium owner's disgust for her. Later, MacArthur falsely accused her of being a Soviet spy, and the owner coaxed her out. She had to live in a painter's house, and finally moved to a hotel, rewriting Zhu De's biography while fighting a lawsuit. Therefore, her spirit was often uneasy and her health was also very bad.

    MacArthur, in the name of the Allied Headquarters, accused Agnes Smedley of being a Soviet spy who was at large, fabricating that she was related to two Japanese revolutionary martyrs who were deeply missed by the people, and slandering them as spies. All the newspapers in the United States printed this news on the front page in large letters. What was this for? Originally, during the Anti-Japanese War, many American journalists had been to China, and some had been to Yan'an or the front of the Eighth Route Army. These journalists had personally seen two different Chinas. From the perspective of the American petty bourgeoisie, they had to admit that the policy of aiding Chiang to destroy China was not beneficial to the United States. Therefore, their words were not beneficial to MacArthur and the other American reactionaries' conspiracies. Therefore, MacArthur and the American rulers wanted to threaten and warn this group of people. In addition, the anti-Soviet conspiracy of Wall Street was added, so they chose Agnes Smedley, a sincere friend of the Chinese people, and also aimed at Agnes Smedley, who would absolutely not be tempted by profit and would not compromise, to make an example of. This plan was sinister and vicious. However, they could not scare her.

    Agnes Smedley stood up and actively counterattacked the enemy. She issued a broadcast to condemn the crimes of the American imperialists. She accused MacArthur of launching a full-scale intervention in the Chinese civil war in order to smoothly support the collapsing Chiang Kai-shek and attack the entire Chinese people, and to make Japan a military base for the United States to dominate East Asia and attack China and the Soviet Union, in order to eliminate Agnes Smedley and clear the way for opposing opinions. Agnes Smedley pointed out that MacArthur was hiding under the legal protection of high-ranking officers from being judged to attack her. She also declared that if MacArthur dared to give up this privilege, she would sue him for defamation. But MacArthur did not dare to come out from under the legal protection privilege. Moreover, the military had to publicly admit that the propaganda against Agnes Smedley was wrong.

    Although Agnes Smedley won and won the sympathy and support of many progressive people, her scope of activities was reduced. Few newspapers and magazines dared to ask her to write articles, and few gatherings dared to invite her to give speeches. Her publishers were also unwilling to publish her biography of Zhu De, and wanted her to revise it. But she still wrote as soon as she heard about materials related to China, and sent them everywhere. If there was a small opportunity, she would take advantage of it. If there was really no way, she would send copies of these materials to many people, asking them to reveal them in their articles or use them in debates.

    Sometimes, she was very tired from working. When she met Chinese friends, she would say: "I am an American, I love America, but America does not have my home, my home is in China. One day I will always go home." When the Chinese people victoriously liberated Beijing and Nanjing, her joy was indescribable. She hoped day and night that she could return to China and serve the Chinese people. She was thinking of various ways to go to China, but the American authorities did not allow her.

    Her health was really not good. In order to deal with the slanders, defamations, and persecutions imposed on her by MacArthur's military headquarters, she hired a lawyer and filed various lawsuits, spending her pitiful savings. Especially that kind of atmosphere made her spirit often excited, which was not conducive to her gall and stomach diseases. Therefore, she had to find a way to go to England again, because the cost of living in England was relatively low, and she had to revise Zhu De's biography. The American authorities, however, limited her to living only in England, or going to France or Italy, and not allowing her to go to the British colonies, for fear that she would pass through Hong Kong to China. American imperialism was afraid of this old and frail woman, and never relaxed its persecution of her.

    Agnes Smedley did not achieve her wish to come to China, and did not enjoy the happiness of stepping on Chinese soil again and seeing the leaders of the Chinese revolution again. Her old illness relapsed in England, she underwent surgery, lost too much blood, and her life could not be saved. She passed away on May 6, 1950, today last year. Before her death, she told her friends that she was willing to hand over her belongings to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De for disposal, and to transport her ashes to Beijing, China. She could not come to New China alive, but after her death, she also wished to let her ashes touch the free land of China. Now, her ashes have been transported to Beijing and will be laid to rest in the great and immortal land of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people will forever mourn this outstanding daughter of the American people and loyal friend of the Chinese people.

　　战士史沫特莱生平
    丁玲
    在美国帝国主义法西斯式的统治下，而能坚持着爱和平、爱真理、富贵不能淫、威武不能屈的战斗品质与精神，是不容易的。据我所见，史沫特莱可以说就是这样的人物中间的一个。她是美国人民的优秀儿女，是中国人民的忠实友人。
    史沫特莱是美国人，是矿场上一个运输工人的女儿。她从小就寻求自由，寻求劳动人民的解放，寻求真理。她获得了知识，接近了革命者，参观了苏联，她懂得了世界上有两个营垒，一个是革命的、正义的、全世界劳动人民的营垒；一个是反动的、战争的、帝国主义法西斯的营垒。而她自己，便选择了前一个营垒。从这样的出发点，她到了中国。从她接近中国人民和中国革命运动那天起，二十多年来，一直没有改变过她的态度。她热爱中国人民，热爱中国革命，热爱中国人民的军队及其领导者。她为她的理想，献出了她所有的一切力量。她是一个真正代表美国人民的美国人。她是中国人民的朋友，我们永远怀念着她为我们所作的工作，尊敬她向美帝国主义所作的不屈的斗争，同情她的遭遇，深深地哀悼她的逝世。
    她的幼年生活是很不幸的。很小的时候，她就以做工来糊口养家，替别人看孩子、洗衣服、当侍女等，工作很累，工资很低，常常一家人整个冬天没有饭吃，只吃西红柿土豆煮汤。史沫特莱在她的自传小说《大地的女儿》上描写道：“我所不在的地方，那里才有幸福呢。”
    史沫特莱拚命节缩她生活上必需的一切，夜晚去学习打字、速记。又继续学习，完成了大学毕业。她为了生存，为了她的家庭，她将她稚嫩的生命，同美国资本主义社会做了坚苦的斗争。这一段日子，为她一生的奋斗生活开辟了道路，使她很早的接近了革命理论，使她终身热情于革命事业，使她能以她的病躯抵抗美帝国主义者许多年来对她的迫害。虽说她终竟被她们所扼杀，但她却从未退却过，停止过，永远是那样的勇敢坚强。
    她接近革命理论，是从认识了几个流亡在美国的印度学者开始的。史沫特莱听了他们的演讲，同他们做了朋友，帮助他们活动，掩护他们，并曾因此牵连入狱，被监禁数月。出狱后，她与他们交往更密，活动也就更积极了，又第二次入狱，出狱后，便离开美国，到了柏林。当时柏林是印度革命者集合的中心，进步的印度人，都知道史沫特莱。
    史沫特莱在丹麦养病时，她写了自传体的长篇小说：《大地的女儿》。从这本书中，可以了解一个叛逆者的心情和行动。她以她的全部热情，贯注在这一创作上。这本书曾轰动一时，被译为德国、丹麦、日本、法国、中国等文字。
    她是一九二八年到中国来的。她的动机，决不是为了这个在欧美人士认为是东方的神秘古国而来，也不是为了“中国，冒险家的乐园”而来。她是为着因为中国是一个被压迫的民族而来。她曾了解过殖民地的印度的苦难，她也就同情半殖民地的中国的革命运动。尤其是在大革命以后，蒋介石的白色恐怖正笼罩着中国土地上的时候，她来中国了，用了德国法兰克福时报社记者的名义。
    在中国她曾到农村，了解农民的生活，又去工厂，了解工人的生活。与鲁迅、茅盾、冯雪峰等都有过从（我也在这时认识她）。后来，与中国的左翼文化界接触了，因此更了解了中国人民的革命要求。经过了这些关系，她搜集到一些中国共产党红军在江西、福建、安徽、河南、湖北、湖南等地革命运动的材料，也曾与从红色区域到上海来的革命工作者谈话。这一些英勇的革命史迹，中国工农红军的战斗在她的心里开着鲜艳的花朵。她崇拜他们，崇拜那些辉煌的战果。她写着报道，一篇又一篇，向全世界播送。她的：《中国红军在前进》，就是在这时写的。还有一本《中国人的命运》也是这时写的。她在这本书里，明确地表示了她对于中国革命的态度。
    史沫特莱在上海这一时期，不只自己写文章寄出去，并且帮助左翼文化界与国际进步机构建立联系，如与美国的《新群众》杂志等，并且创办主持《中国呼声报》。这个刊物，在当时是反蒋的英文刊物，很起过一些影响。史沫特莱经常在上面发表文章。
    她用各种方式，团结在上海的外国人。向他们宣传、募捐，组织他们替革命工作做交通，掩护某些革命同志。她常常向他们说“既然你懂得真理了，你就应该想想怎么办。”她并动员有些人们到红色区域去。
    她帮助红色救济会的工作。她帮助那时宋庆龄、蔡元培、鲁迅、杨杏佛等人主持的人权保障同盟的工作。她常常整天整天地工作，夜深还不休息。凡是熟识她的中外朋友，都惊奇于她的精力充沛，钦佩她的热情。
    但帝国主义者是不会让她好好工作下去的。巡捕房的包探，守候在她住宅的门口，出外有钉梢的。电话里讲话，也有人偷听。她丝毫没有退缩，她去美国大使馆抗议。她斥骂在她门口“站岗”的特务。她想许多法子，逃避那群狗的耳目，来进行她的活动。
    中国的反动文人胡适、丁文江，非常讨厌她。胡适提议向德国的福兰克福时报社告状，说她勾结中国共产党，要报社解聘她，并且拿这些话恐吓她。这使她不得不脱离了时报社，失去了记者的名义。她又多病，为了病，她不得不暂回美国，那个她不愿回去的美国。她回去没有多久，便又回中国了。这时正是中国人民救国运动高涨、抗日民族统一战线扩大的时候。
    一九三六年十一月间，她到了西安。西安这时是“反动”的前线。蒋介石亲自到西安召开军事会议，镇压爱国运动。这时，驻在西安的张学良、杨虎城及东北西北的许多将领，正接受了中国共产党的主张，团结抗日，谋取统一战线的前途。在西安的共产党人，也不少；民主党派也有在这里工作的，史沫特莱接触了如此复杂紧张的政治场面，显得分外兴奋。到双一二蒋介石被扣时，她简直欢喜得不得了。她了解蒋介石的反动本质，是一个顽固的中国人民的死敌，他决不会真真地向人民低头，但她究竟还不能完全懂得中国革命的复杂性，有一个时候，她不能明白为什么又把蒋介石放了。但这一事变，促成了她坚决的要求到八路军去，到中国民主圣地延安去。
    她到了八路军总部，晤见了八路军将领彭德怀同志、任弼时同志、贺龙同志、关向应同志、陆定一同志、杨尚昆同志……。她仿佛见了许久未见面的家里人，说不完爱慕的话，问了各式各样的问题。在每天应接不暇的新事物新问题新感觉的忙迫之中，她还是不离开她的速记簿与打字机，她不断地写文章报道。
    一九三七年春天，她到了延安，住在延安城里，过一般干部的生活，很俭朴。在这时，她把大部分时间，做了与朱德总司令谈话的工作。她预备写朱德传。她在这些谈话中，不只是了解了朱德总司令的伟大人格，而且更理解了中国人民与中国红军。她更爱中国了。她除了写文章，搜集材料以外，经常到医院去，参加卫生会议，关心医药的问题，她也关心妇女工作。
    七七抗日战争开始，她随军到太原，到了五台前线。后来，她跟着总司令部转移，经过太行，驻在临汾附近的村子里。这种行军是很苦的。史沫特莱沿途还照顾其他的同志。西北战地服务团的同志们，常受到她的照顾。她的勤务员生病了，她像一个母亲似地看护着他。
    一九三八年，她到了武汉。她经常把平型关战斗、阳明堡战斗的事迹，向群众作宣传，展览八路军在前线所获得的胜利品：大衣、军刀、望远镜、皮包、防毒面具等等。她募集捐款，加上她自己的稿费，买了药品、手套、风镜……又把这些东西送到八路军前线去，她才感到一点安慰。她又动员外籍记者到八路军前线。连武汉一个很有名的天主教的主教，也受了她的影响，把女儿送到临汾去。这些人，都曾起过一些作用。其中值得提到的，就是卡尔逊。卡尔逊是她的很好朋友，受了她的影响，也到了八路军前线，参观了晋察冀抗日根据地。回去后，热心地把他所见，真实地告诉那些想知道八路军情况的人们。
    她又到过新四军。设法捐送药品到前方。她又继续写成她的第三本书：《中国反攻了》第四本书：《中国之战歌》。在这些书里，她都是爱憎分明，热情澎湃，暴露美帝国主义对华阴谋，暴露蒋介石匪帮的荒淫无耻；歌颂八路军和中国人民的勇敢、坚强，坚持抗战，为公忘私，一切为了民族解放，为了革命胜利的不怕牺牲的高贵品质。她的书受到进步人士广泛的欢迎，这些书又被译为俄、德、中文等。
    她的身体原来就不好，加之长期紧张的工作，她不得不回到美国去休养。她想能在休养中写朱德传。
    她回国以后，并没有休息，在经济状况极端窘迫的条件下，仍然继续为中国革命作宣传工作。
    她对革命事业的热情，使她有很大的活动能力，走到那里，她都能团结一批人，使这些人同情她，同情她的工作，反对美国帝国主义。她走到那里，那里就感到有生气，她一出现，人们就活动了。她常常组织些讲演会、座谈会。她到乡下去，就在附近一个大学校里，组织大学的女生们，请在美国的中国革命者，讲中国问题，和现实的生动生活。因为她看得见新生的力量，她就慢慢地锻炼成一个最会说话的人。她的话语都是富有煽动力的。她的文字也非常能吸引人与感动人。
    辩论会上，中国反动作家林语堂发言诬蔑中国人民，她当时就义正辞严地斥骂林语堂：“我要是你，简直无容身之地，你还做一个中国人！”
    美国反动书报《生活》杂志，想以重价租用她所收藏的关于中国共产党及八路军的活动照片，用巧语骗她，她不给。她很干脆地回答：“生活杂志能做出对于中国人民有利的事么？”
    她有一个时候，住在乡下的一个修养所中，从事朱德传的写作。那里，生活程度省俭一些。但因为她常常与一些左翼分子来往，又出去作演讲、广播等活动，引起休养所老板对她的厌恶。后来，麦克阿瑟又诬告她是苏联间谍，老板就把她哄出来了。她只好寄居在一个画家家里，最后搬到旅馆里，一面又重写朱德传，一面又要打官司。因此她的精神常常不安宁，身体也很不好。
    麦克阿瑟以盟军总部名义，控告史沫特莱为逍遥法外的苏联间谍，罗织她与日本两个极为人民所追念的革命烈士有关，诬蔑他们是间谍。美国所有的报纸，都用大号字把这消息登在第一页上。这为的是什么呢？原来在抗战时期，曾有不少美国记者到过中国，有的到过延安或八路军前方，这些记者亲眼看到两个不同的中国，他们从美国中小资产阶级的观点也不得不认为援蒋灭华的政策于美国并无利益。因此，他们的说话，对于麦克阿瑟和其它美国的反动派的阴谋是不利的。因此，麦克阿瑟与美国统治者们，要对这群人来一个威吓，警告他们，又加上华尔街的反苏阴谋，于是就选择了一个中国人民的真诚的朋友，史沫特莱，同时也看准绝对不受利诱，不会妥协的史沫特莱而开刀了。这个计划，是阴险的，狠毒的。可是，他们却并不能吓倒她。
    史沫特莱挺身而出，积极地向敌人反攻。她发表广播，来控诉美国帝国主义者们的罪行。她控诉麦克阿瑟是为了顺利地全面干涉中国内战，扶持垮台的蒋介石，向全中国人民进攻，而且使日本成为美国独霸东亚进攻中国与苏联的军事基地，以消灭史沫特莱来扫清反对言论的道路。史沫特莱指出：麦克阿瑟是躲在高级军官不受裁判的法律庇护下，来攻击她。她并且宣称，如果麦克阿瑟敢于放弃这种特权，她就要控告他的诽谤罪。但麦克阿瑟不敢从法律庇护的特权下走出来。而且军部还不得不公开承认对史沫特莱的宣传是错误的。
    史沫特莱虽然胜利了，博得很多进步人士的同情与支持。可是她的活动范围，却被缩小了，很少有报纸杂志敢于请她写文章，很少集会敢于请她讲演。她的出版商人，也不愿意出版她的朱德传，要她修改。但她，还是听到有关中国的材料立刻就写，写了就到处送。稍有一个空子，就要钻进去，实在没有办法了，她就把这些材料的抄本送给许多人，要他们在文章中透露出去，或者在辩论会上用进去。
    有的时候，她工作得很疲倦，遇见了中国朋友，便说：“我是一个美国人，我爱美国，但美国没有我的家，我的家是在中国。有一天我总要回家去的”。当中国人民胜利的解放了北京、南京时，她的快乐无以形容，她日夜盼望她能回到中国来，为中国人民服务。她想着各种办法打算到中国来。但美国当局不准许她。
    她的身体实在不行了，为了对付麦克阿瑟军部所加之于她的诬蔑、诽谤、迫害，她延请律师，做种种控诉，花掉了很可怜的一点储蓄。尤其是那种气氛，使她精神常常昂奋，对于她的胆病和胃病，都不利。因此，她不得不又设法到英国去，因为英国的生活比较低廉，她还得修改朱德传。美国当局，却限定她只能住在英国，或者去法国或意大利，不准到英国的殖民地去。为的是怕她经过香港到中国来。美帝国主义对这个年老体衰的女人，是害怕的，而且是丝毫不放松对于她的迫害。
    史沫特莱没有达到她到中国来的想望，没有享到她重新踏上中国土地、重见中国革命领袖的幸福。她在英国旧疾复发，施行手术，流血过多，生命无法挽救。她在去年今天——一九五○年五月六号逝世了。她临终时，告诉她的友人，她愿意把她的遗物交给朱德总司令处理，把她的骨灰运往中国北京。她生不能来到新中国，但她死了，她也愿让她的骨灰亲着中国的自由的土地。现在，她的骨灰已经运来北京即将奠入中华人民共和国伟大不朽的土地。中国人民，将永远悼念这位美国人民的优秀女儿和中国人民的忠实朋友。
