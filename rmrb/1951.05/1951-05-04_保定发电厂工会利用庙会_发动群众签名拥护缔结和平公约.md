    Baoding Power Plant Union Uses Temple Fair
    to Mobilize the Masses to Sign in Support of Concluding a Peace Pact

Editor:
    The Propaganda and Education Department of the Baoding Power Plant Union, on April 21st, the day with the largest crowds at the Liu Shouzhen Temple Fair in Baoding, mobilized the masses to sign in support of concluding a peace pact. We set up tea tables at the factory gate, arranged photo exhibitions, and used loudspeakers to publicize the resistance against America and aid to Korea, calling on everyone to sign the declaration supporting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers in order to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression. Xie Yushan from An Guo City said after signing, "We have suffered enough from the Japanese devils. My brother was killed by the Japanese devils. I must take practical action to resist America and aid Korea, and avenge my brother." Zhang Rongchun, a family member of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier from Shen County, said, "For the sake of peace, both of my sons have joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight the American devils. I will write to them and tell them to fight the American devils even more bravely." Old Grandpa Shi Laokai, a family member of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier from Gao Zhuang, said, "My wife and I are over seventy years old, but we will work hard to do a good job in production. I will tell my son not to worry about his family and to wholeheartedly resist America and aid Korea." Children also eagerly signed after listening to the propaganda. On that day, 1,540 people signed.

    保定发电厂工会利用庙会
    发动群众签名拥护缔结和平公约编辑同志：
    保定市发电厂工会宣教部在四月二十一日保定市刘守真庙会人数最多的一天，发动群众签名拥护缔结和平公约，我们在工厂大门口设置了茶桌，布置了照片展览，并用广播筒向过往行人宣传抗美援朝，号召大家为保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争，在拥护五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名。安国城内谢玉山签名后说：“我们受够日本鬼子的苦了，我哥哥就是被日本鬼子打死的。我一定要以实际行动抗美援朝，反对美国武装日本，给我哥哥报仇。”深县中国人民志愿军家属张荣春说：“为了和平，我两个儿子都参加了中国人民志愿军去打美国鬼子啦。我要给他们去信，叫他们更勇敢地打美国鬼子。”高庄中国人民志愿军家属石老开老大爷说：“我老俩七十多岁了，可是我要努力搞好生产。叫我儿子不要惦记家里，一心一意抗美援朝。”儿童们听了宣传以后，也争着签名。当天就有一千五百四十人签了名。
