　　People Welcome Cartoon Propaganda

Editor:
　　I work at the Mentougou Cultural Center in Beijing. Recently, many stores have established cartoon display windows. As far as I know, industrial and commercial households in the sixteen districts of Beijing's suburbs are very welcoming of this type of cartoon propaganda. Our center recently held several cartoon exhibitions in the countryside, which also proves that the general public is very fond of cartoon art. This form of propaganda is more easily accepted by the general public than oral propaganda. However, attention must be paid to the following: (1) The content of cartoon works should be easy to understand; (2) There should be a dedicated person to explain (or provide written explanations); (3) It is best to have strong storylines; (4) New works should be constantly replaced as the situation develops (for example, "The History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China" is posted everywhere. If there are no new works after a period of time, the audience will no longer pay attention); (5) Art workers and bookstores should print a large number of cartoons to meet the needs of the general readers. Readers with painting skills should also actively participate in the painting work and strive for the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda.

　　群众欢迎漫画宣传编辑同志：
    我是在北京门头沟文化馆工作的。最近有很多商店都建立了橱窗漫画，据我所知京郊十六区的工商业户对于这种漫画宣传都非常欢迎。我馆最近举行几次漫画下乡展览，也证明广大群众对于漫画艺术是非常热爱的。这种宣传形式比口头宣传更能为广大群众接受。但必须注意：（一）漫画作品的内容要通俗易懂；（二）要有专人讲解（或文字说明）；（三）最好要故事性强的；（四）要随着形势的发展不断更换新的作品；（如目前到处张贴“美帝侵华史”，如再过一个时期没有新的作品出现，观众就会不再注意了。）（五）美术工作者及书店要大量印制漫画，以满足广大读者的要求。具有绘画能力的读者，也应积极参加绘制工作，为抗美援朝的宣传而努力。
