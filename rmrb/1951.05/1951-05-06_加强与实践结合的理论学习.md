　　Strengthen Theoretical Learning Combined with Practice
       Ke Boren
    Yesterday was the birthday of Marx and our learning festival.

    Marx was the greatest thinker of modern times and a revolutionary who never gave up. The greatness of Marx lies in his combination of the qualities of a cool-headed thinker and a passionate revolutionary.

    Marx was first and foremost a revolutionary. He devoted his life to the cause of the liberation of the proletariat. However, he did not participate in the proletarian liberation struggle solely on the basis of temporary enthusiasm, but because he had a correct understanding of the development of history, deeply believed that capitalism would inevitably be replaced by communism, and that the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society was the historical mission of the proletariat. In other words, the reason why Marx became a great revolutionary was because he was also an outstanding thinker.

    Marx was different from past thinkers, and Marx was greater than all past thinkers, precisely because he participated in the actual revolutionary movement. He used science as a tool of revolution. He engaged in theoretical work to forge theoretical weapons for the workers' struggle. He guided practice with theory and tested theory with practice. Chairman Mao said this about Marx: "He studied nature, studied history, studied the proletarian revolution, and created dialectical materialism, historical materialism, and the theory of proletarian revolution. In this way, Marx can be considered a complete intellectual. He is different from the half-intellectual. He participated in the actual revolutionary movement, returned to reality to investigate and study, and summarized various things. This summarized knowledge is called theory." ("Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing")

    Without revolutionary theory, there would be no revolutionary movement. Only revolutionary theory that does not deviate from the revolutionary movement can guide the revolutionary movement.

    Today, as we commemorate the 133rd anniversary of Marx's birth, we must first learn from Marx's spirit of combining theory with practice.

    Combining theory with practice is the spirit we should have when engaging in learning.

    We oppose dogmatic learning that is divorced from practice and only recites the words of theoretical works. The importance of theory lies in its guiding role in practice. Theory divorced from practice becomes empty theory and is of no use. However, if we take the opposition to dogmatic learning to mean that we are against studying the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, then we are making a big mistake! What we oppose is "not caring about the affairs of the world, concentrating on reading Marx and Lenin," we oppose "not caring about the affairs of the world," not opposing "reading Marx and Lenin," we oppose being divorced from practice, not opposing learning theory. Theoretical works are extremely valuable. We not only want to learn these works, but also strive to intensify our study of these works. The conclusions drawn by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin from historical and revolutionary practice are the universal truths of revolution. The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the universal truths of revolution, must be studied. The core of the issue is: we cannot be satisfied with reading these works fluently, but must further combine these revolutionary universal truths with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. We must be good at learning to apply the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to profoundly and scientifically analyze China's practical problems and find out its laws of development. We must be good at studying China's historical practice and revolutionary reality based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and creating our own special theory that meets China's actual needs.

    We must intensify our study of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, because these works are the treasure house of revolutionary universal truth. But we cannot study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as dogmas, and we cannot make reciting individual conclusions or words our goal; instead, we must learn from their works their standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to solve China's practical problems. Therefore, we must not only study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the domestic and international situation, and also study Chinese history. That is to say, we must have theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge.

    We must not only study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also strive to study the works of Chairman Mao. From the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, we can learn the universal truth of revolution and learn international revolutionary experience. From Chairman Mao's works, we can learn the theory of the Chinese revolution and learn Chinese revolutionary experience. Chairman Mao's works are the Marxism-Leninism of China. We must be good at learning to apply Chairman Mao's standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to study and solve practical problems in various regions and at various times.

    It is difficult for intellectuals who lack practical revolutionary experience to link theoretical learning with practice. They do not know how to connect. Therefore, they must participate in actual revolutionary work and must seriously study the various policies of the People's Government. Resisting America and Aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries are China's current actual revolutionary struggles. If intellectuals can actually participate in these struggles, they can gain revolutionary perceptual knowledge and gain revolutionary practical experience. With revolutionary practice, they can connect with the revolution and begin to learn how to connect. Being able to personally and directly participate in these struggles is naturally the best, even if it is only for a short period of time; if they cannot leave their jobs, then looking at exhibitions, listening to accusations, participating in various conferences, and carefully studying the reports of various specific situations published in the newspapers can also indirectly gain some specific practical knowledge. In short, to overcome dogmatic learning, we must be concerned about China's current actual revolutionary struggle.

    The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao are not easy to fully understand. Memorizing their words is not difficult. Fully understanding their spirit is not easy. This is not only because Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao have extremely extensive knowledge that we cannot match; but also because the conclusions they draw from historical practice and revolutionary practice are difficult for people with no or very little revolutionary practical experience to understand their spirit. Perceptual knowledge is the basis of rational knowledge. It is difficult for people without perceptual knowledge to fully understand rational knowledge. Therefore, to improve our ability to understand the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, we must participate in actual revolutionary struggles and seriously study the situation of revolutionary struggles to increase our revolutionary perceptual knowledge. Participating in struggles, studying the current situation, studying policies, and studying history are indispensable conditions for understanding the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao.

    We must learn from Marx's model and closely combine theory with practice. We must, in accordance with the spirit of Marx, intensify our study of theory for the sake of practice, and only by actively participating in practice can we learn theory well!

　　加强与实践结合的理论学习
       柯柏年
    昨天是马克思诞辰，又是我们的学习节。
    马克思是近代的最伟大的思想家，同时又是一位百折不挠的革命家。马克思的伟大，就在于他兼备冷静的思想家和热情的革命家的特质。
    马克思首先是一个革命家。他一生致力于无产阶级的解放事业。可是，他并不是单凭一时的热情而参加无产阶级的解放斗争，而是由于他对历史的发展有了正确的见解，深信资本主义必然为共产主义所代替，而推翻资本主义和建立共产社会正是无产阶级的历史使命。换一句话说，马克思之所以成为伟大的革命家，是因为他同时又是一位卓越的思想家。
    马克思不同于过去的思想家，马克思比过去的一切思想家都更为伟大，就在于他参加了实际的革命运动。他把科学当做革命的工具。他之从事理论的工作，是为着锻炼工人斗争的理论的武器。他以理论指导实践，又以实践考验理论。毛主席是这样讲到马克思：“他研究了自然，研究了历史，研究了无产阶级革命，创造了辩证唯物论、历史唯物论与无产阶级革命的理论。这样，马克思算得一个完全的知识分子。他与半知识分子有别，他参加了实际革命运动，他回到实际中去加以调查研究，概括了各种东西，这种概括的知识就叫做理论。”（《整顿学风党风文风》）
    没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。只有不脱离革命运动的革命理论，才能指导着革命运动。
    我们今天在纪念马克思诞生一百三十三周年，首先要学习马克思的把理论与实践相结合的精神。
    理论与实践结合，这就是我们从事学习时应该具备的精神。
    我们反对脱离了实践的、只背诵理论著作的字句的、教条主义式的学习。理论的重要性是在于理论对实践起着指导作用，理论脱离了实践，就成为空洞的理论，就没有什么用处。但是，如果把反对教条主义式的学习，以为就是反对研读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，那就大错而特错了！我们之反对“闭门不问天下事，一心死读马列书”，我们反对的是“不问天下事”，不是反对“读马列书”，我们反对的是脱离实践，不是反对学习理论。理论的著作是极可宝贵的。我们不仅是要学习这些著作，而且是要努力加紧学习这些著作。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林从历史实践和革命实践中抽出来的总结论，是革命的普遍真理。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，革命的普遍真理，是不可不学习的。问题的核心是：我们不能满足于熟读这些著作，还必须更进一步地把这些革命的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合。我们要善于学会应用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的立场、观点、方法来深刻地、科学地分析中国的实际问题，找出它的发展规律。我们要善于根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理来研究中国的历史实践与革命实际，创造出合乎中国实际需要的自己的特殊性的理论。
    我们要加紧学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，因为这些著作是革命普遍真理的宝库。但我们不能把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作当做教条来学习，不能以背诵个别结论或词句为能事；而是要从他们的著作学得他们的立场、观点、和方法来解决中国的实际问题。因此，我们不仅要研究马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，还要研究国内国际的现状，还要研究中国历史。这即是说，我们要具备理论的知识，也要具备实际的知识。
    我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，还必须努力学习毛主席的著作。从马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，我们可以学习革命的普遍真理，学习国际革命经验。从毛主席的著作，我们可以学习中国革命的理论，学习中国革命经验。毛主席的著作，是中国化的马克思列宁主义。我们要善于学会应用毛主席的立场、观点、方法来研究和解决各地在各个时期的实际问题。
    理论的学习要联系实际，对于缺乏实际革命经验的知识分子来说，是有困难的。他们不知怎样联系。因此，他们必须参加实际的革命工作，必须认真研究人民政府的各种政策。抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命，就是中国目前的实际革命斗争。知识分子如果能够实际参加这些斗争，就可以获得革命的感性知识，获得革命的实际经验，有了革命实际可以和革命相连系，而且开始学习怎样连系。能够亲身直接参加这些斗争，自然是最好不过的，就使只是短时期也好；如果不能离开自己工作岗位，那么，看看展览会，听听控诉，参加各种大会，仔细研究报纸所登载的各种具体情况的报道，也可以间接获得一些具体的实际知识。总而言之，我们要克服教条主义式的学习，必须关心中国当前的实际革命斗争。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的著作，是不易充分理解的。熟记其词句，并不困难。充分理解其精神却不容易。这并不仅仅是因为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的知识都极渊博，为我们所不及；而且是因为他们从历史实践和革命实践中抽出来的总结论，毫无革命实践经验或只有很少革命实践经验的人们是很难领会其精神。感性知识是理性知识的基础。没有感性知识的人们，很难充分了解理性知识。因此，要提高我们对于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的著作的理解能力，就要参加实际革命斗争，认真研究革命斗争的情况，以增加我们的革命感性知识。参加斗争，研究现状，研究政策，研究历史，是理解马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的著作之必不可少的条件。
    我们要学习马克思的模范，把理论与实践紧密地结合起来。我们要依着马克思的精神，加紧学习理论，是为着实践，而只有积极参加实践，才能学好理论！
