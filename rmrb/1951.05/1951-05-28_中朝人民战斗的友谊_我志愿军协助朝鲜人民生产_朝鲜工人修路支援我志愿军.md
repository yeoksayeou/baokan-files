　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th: A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Han River front is actively helping the Korean people with production during lulls in the fighting. Some units' soldiers, because they have to work, study, or take air defense measures during the day, do it in the dark at night. Soldiers of this unit saw that residents in a certain area lacked labor, and cotton stalks and grain stalks were still left in the fields. They decided to first help them pull cotton stalks and grain stalks, and then help them deliver manure and plow the land. After seven nights of work, they manually cleared cotton stalks and grain stalks from 18 Chinese acres of land. Because of language barriers, the volunteer soldiers sometimes did not know what kind of work the Korean people needed them to help with, so they watched what the Korean people were doing and joined in. A cook from a certain unit saw local residents repairing a well, so he took off his clothes and helped with the repairs. A certain unit also used air raid shelter time to help residents gather more than 4,000 catties of firewood. The volunteer soldiers fought while helping the masses with production, deeply moving the Korean people. They said, "You help us fight the American robbers, avenge us, and also help us produce, how can we repay you?" Many old women boiled maltose for the soldiers to eat. An old woman from a village took the candy to the fortification to ask the soldiers to eat it. If the soldiers didn't eat it, she wouldn't leave until the soldier took a bite, and then she walked down the mountain with a smile.
    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th: The Korean people are actively supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers in their counterattack. The story of the miners in a certain mine in northern Korea leading the masses to build roads is a good example.

　　Before the Volunteers prepared to launch a powerful counterattack in coordination with the Korean People's Army, military transport was extremely frequent. Workers at a mine in northern Korea specially selected forty people to lead the masses in opening up a new thirty-li-long road through the mountains in order to speed up military transport, shortening the original journey by fifty li.

　　Before the project started, the workers assisted the government in mobilizing and organizing about 500 people, and first mobilized their own families to participate. Under the leadership of the forty workers, more than 500 people worked nervously in the mountains, thickets, and mud ditches day and night, braving constant enemy air raids, regardless of wind or rain. Many people had blisters all over their hands, and their eyes were bloodshot, but they continued to work with doubled energy. Li Changjun, a 58-year-old worker with gray hair, said: "I am old and cannot take up a gun to fight the American devils at the front. Repairing bridges and roads in the rear is a way to serve the country and repay the Volunteers." The workers led the masses to complete the task within the scheduled period, enabling thousands of vehicles loaded with supplies to travel more quickly and continuously to the front line via the new road.

　　中朝人民战斗的友谊
    我志愿军协助朝鲜人民生产
    朝鲜工人修路支援我志愿军
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军某部在汉江前线利用战争间隙积极帮助朝鲜人民生产。有些部队的战士因为白天要进行工作、学习或防空，没有时间，就在夜晚摸黑做。该部战士们在某地见居民缺乏劳动力，棉花秸、谷草还留在地里，就决定先帮他们拔棉花秸、谷草，再帮他们送粪，犁地。经过七个晚上的工作，他们就将合中国亩十八亩地的棉花秸、谷草用手拔干净了。由于言语不通，志愿军战士们有时不知道朝鲜人民需要他们帮忙干些什么活，于是他们就看朝鲜人民干什么，自己也就插手去做什么。某部炊事员见当地居民正在修理水井，也就脱了衣服下手帮助修理。某部还利用防空时间，帮助居民打柴四千多斤。志愿军战士一面作战，一面帮助群众生产，使朝鲜人民深深感动。他们说：“你们帮助我们打美国强盗，替我们报仇，还帮助我们生产，叫我们怎样报答呢？”有许多老大娘熬麦芽糖叫战士们吃。某村一位老大娘拿着糖找到工事里去要战士吃，战士不吃她就不走，一直到战士吃了一口，她才笑迷迷地走下山去。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】朝鲜人民积极支援中国人民志愿军进行反击战。朝鲜北部某地矿山工人领导群众开路的事迹，就是一个好例子。
    在志愿军准备配合朝鲜人民军发起强大反击之前，军运极为频繁。朝鲜北部某矿山的工人，为了加速军运，特地抽调了四十个人，领导群众从丛山中开辟出一条三十里长的新汽车道，使原来的路程因此缩短了五十里。
    在工程开始之前，工人们协助政府动员和组织了约五百人，并首先动员了自己的家属参加。在四十个工人的带头和领导下，五百多个人冒着敌机的不断袭扰，日夜风雨无阻地在山岭上、荆棘丛中、泥沟里紧张地工作着。很多人手上打满了血泡，眼睛熬起了红丝，但是仍精神百倍地继续工作着。须发花白的五十八岁的老工人李昌俊说：“我年纪老了，不能拿起枪杆到前方和美国鬼子拚命，在后方修桥补路，就是为国效劳和报答志愿军的办法。”工人们带领群众在预定期间内完成了任务，使成千成万辆满载物资的汽车通过新路更迅速地源源地驶向前线。
