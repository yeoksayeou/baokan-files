Chang'an Avenue - Demonstration Parade Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (Sketches of the Capital, No. 4)
    By Shao Yu

    This street has long been called "Chang'an Avenue,"
     But think about it, when has it ever been "peaceful"?
     No one can forget what Chiang Kai-shek and the imperialists did here:
     Rampaging! Murdering! Robbing! Faucets, broadswords, machine guns...!
     How many people, how many years, have longed for today!
     How much blood, how much sweat, created today!
     Today, Chang'an Avenue is so wide and open!
     Today, it is truly Chang'an Avenue.
     Defend it, defend everything we have gained!
     We surge forward on this broad road!
     The imperialists and their running dogs,
     Don't even think about crawling onto our land again!

　　长安街——抗美援朝示威大游行（首都速写之四）
    邵宇作
    这条街，老早就叫“长安街”，
     想想看，它过去几时“安”过呢？
     谁也忘不了蒋介石、帝国主义在这干的什么：
     横行霸道！杀人！抢劫！水龙头、大刀片、机关枪……！
     多少人，多少年，才盼到了今天！
     多少血，多少汗，创造了今天！
     今天长安街是多么宽阔开朗！
     今天它才是长安街了。
     保卫它，保卫我们获得的一切！
     我们在这广阔的道路上汹涌前进！
     帝国主义和他的走狗，
     休想再爬到我们的土地上！
