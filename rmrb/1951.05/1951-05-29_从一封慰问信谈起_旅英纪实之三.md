Starting with a Letter of Condolence
——Travel Journal in Britain, Part 3
Wu Wentao
    "Friends:
    I don't know if you would agree to let me send you a pound to express my gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers. When I heard that the Chinese Volunteers had gone to Korea to relieve the suffering of women and children, my heart felt relieved. I hope you can forward this small gift.
            Emily Watson
              November 11, 1950
    I don't know Watson, and I only know from the name "Emily" that the writer is a lady or madam. Her letter was forwarded to me by a friend. I cherish this simple letter very much and believe it represents the common voice of millions of British people.
    Many British friends have told me that American imperialism's aggression against Korea has aroused great resentment among the general British people. Regarding the defeats of the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield, many people commented: "The arrogant Americans have received their due punishment!" At the end of last November, when Truman, trembling from defeat, threatened to use all weapons, including atomic bombs, on the Korean battlefield to expand the war, in front of the British Prime Minister's official residence and in the corridors of the House of Commons, there were long lines of representatives of industrial workers, youth, women, doctors... waiting to submit letters of opinion to government leaders and meet with the members of parliament in their constituencies to express their protests. Countless letters and telegrams poured in from all over the country to 10 Downing Street (the seat of the British government), warning the government not to get involved in a war against China. Workers' meetings even passed resolutions that if Washington dared to use atomic bombs, they would retaliate with strikes. When Attlee hurriedly flew to the United States on December 3rd to meet with Truman, the executive committee of the London Trades Council, representing 600,000 workers, as well as other people's organizations and individuals, also sent telegrams urging him to stand up to Uncle Sam.
    Needless to say, the Chinese people hold these sincere and righteous actions of the masses in high esteem. Although the British Labour government has taken many unfriendly actions towards China in following the American aggressors, the common desire of the people of China and Britain is peace and friendship between the two great nations. The Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association, established in London in December 1949, is a clear expression of this desire of the British people.
    According to newspaper reports, the mass movement at the end of last year caused a reaction in London political circles. More than a hundred Labour MPs, including Labour Party Chairman Alice Bacon, jointly put forward a statement that seemed critical of the American government. Soon, with the participation of five Labour MPs, one Labour peer, and one Conservative MP, a group called the "Committee for Peace with China" emerged.
    On January 15th, the initiators of the "Committee for Peace with China" published an advertisement in the Manchester Guardian, explaining the background and purpose of the association:
    "The whole of Britain is deeply alarmed by the events in Korea and the danger of war with China.
    "In the belief that we should do everything possible to avoid this disaster, recently about two thousand five hundred people gathered at Kingsway Hall in London under the convocation of the 'Committee for Peace with China' and passed a resolution calling for a glorious reconciliation, recognition of the People's Republic of China's right to a seat on the Security Council, and reaffirmation of the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation regarding Taiwan. We believe that the United Nations was right to condemn North Korea as an aggressor and regret China's intervention (we do not associate with those who hold beliefs contrary to the above), but we believe that our government (referring to the British government) should continue to take the initiative along the following lines:
    "(1) We should strengthen our conviction that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation regarding Taiwan are binding on all signatories. (2) We should join with the Dominions and other members of the United Nations to seek China's entry into the Security Council. (3) We should express our opposition to any expansion of the Korean War. (4) We should seek an early and fair resolution of the Korean issue and, in accordance with the intentions and authority of the United Nations, propose the establishment of a unified and independent Korea. (5) We should strive to fully cooperate with India, Pakistan, and other Asian countries in renewed efforts within the United Nations to reconcile current political problems and consider clear methods for the economic recovery of Korea."
    The day after the founding conference of the association (January 9th), the Manchester Guardian reported: "The organizers of the 'Committee for Peace with China' have apparently deliberately formulated a program to prevent communists and their sympathizers from entering the leadership organs of the association or the local committees. They (referring to those joining the association) must declare sympathy with 'the United Nations' correct condemnation of North Korea as an aggressor, and the United Nations' military action to carry out its functions to smash the aggression and ensure a fair and democratic solution...'"
    Subsequently, many people concerned about Sino-British relations and world peace inquired about and requested the association to take joint action with other peace-keeping organizations while developing branches of the "Committee for Peace with China." This was revealed in the "New Statesman and Nation" magazine's column. However, the commentary in the March 10th issue of the journal, signed by "Critic," gave a negative answer. At the same time, in a debate with British Upper House member Sir Lindsay about the China issue, Comrade Doughty, Deputy Chairman of the British Communist Party and Editor-in-Chief of "Labour Monthly," mentioned: "...If we want to promote Anglo-Chinese friendship, we must try to get the British government to change its policy. I welcome the efforts made by organizations such as the 'Committee for Peace with China' and the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association for this purpose." (Manchester Guardian, February 17th) This conversation aroused a distorted and rogue statement from three initiators of the "Committee for Peace with China" - Norman Bower (Conservative MP), Henry Carter, and Sorensen (Labour MP): "...We have no relationship with the British Communist Party and its affiliated organizations. Therefore, Mr. Doughty's welcome to the existence of this association seems to be in agreement with the United Nations' condemnation of North Korea as an aggressor, which is very interesting because this view is a prerequisite for joining this association." (Manchester Guardian, March 5th.)
    At the February 24th conference of the association's Hampstead district in London, a national committee member named Margaret Fry explained that the association's intention was "not to embarrass the government. On the contrary, the work done by the 'Committee for Peace with China' can be very helpful to the government. It will enable British negotiators to propose certain policies at international conferences, saying: 'We have no choice! Because the sentiment against war with China in our country is so strong, we must avoid it at all costs...'”
    After Ms. Fry finished speaking, Sir John Pratt, former Far Eastern Affairs Advisor to the British Foreign Office, made a positive criticism of the association's program:
    "The 'Committee for Peace with China' leaflet says 'The United Nations correctly condemned North Korea as an aggressor.' I think this move by the United Nations was wrong and has very serious consequences. The United Nations has created a precedent that any country condemned by the United States must automatically be stigmatized as an aggressor, regardless of the facts. We started with Korea, and the second on the list is China. Everyone knows that the United States has been engaging in aggression against China from Taiwan for nearly two years, but our representatives at the United Nations voted to slander China as an aggressor. We were led to this humiliating and disgraceful position because our people were not told the truth, and those who knew the truth were unwilling to face reality." (The above quotations are based on Pratt's speech personally corrected in the March 13th Manchester Guardian)
    I believe that Pratt's words hit the sore spot of the "Committee for Peace with China." In any case, slandering North Korea as an aggressor is a blatant lie that is detrimental to the British people's effective and united action for Sino-British friendship, peace, and their own interests. Regardless of subjective motives, the leaders of the "Committee for Peace with China" opened a chilling back door in the program for the American imperialist aggressors and their British accomplices. We see that in the midst of popular indignation, Attlee flew to Washington and declared in the joint communique with Truman the differences between Britain and the United States on the China issue, but the lion suffering from rickets did not roar at the flying eagle. Shortly after the Truman-Attlee meeting, the British government followed the United States in slandering China as an "aggressor." The "Committee for Peace with China," which originally expressed opposition to this step by the British government that was directly hostile to the Chinese people, acquiesced in this "fait accompli" and turned to expressing opposition to sanctions.
    In fact, long before Truman started his voting machine at Lake Success, the British ruling class had already agreed to this disgraceful slander. This can be seen from the commentary in the January 13th issue of the British monopolists' publication "The Economist." It said:
    "We have no objection to the matter (referring to the slander of China)...but we very much dislike the suggestion of imposing sanctions on China. The harm that sanctions are supposed to produce is obvious—it will involve not insignificant risks to Hong Kong—but we see no benefit. We earnestly do not believe that sanctions will make Mao Tse-tung change his policy, or that they will be of any particular harm to him. As our past painful experience has shown, sanctions that do not work will ultimately damage the credibility of the United Nations more than not imposing sanctions at all. Therefore, we fervently hope that the Americans will not pursue the idea of sanctions. This is not out of a desire for appeasement or any lack of realistic understanding of the world situation. On the contrary, for us, the unrealistic attitude seems to be to concentrate all attention and resources on the Far East. Of course, maintaining cooperation with the United States is the basis of our policy, and if the US government, after hearing all these arguments, insists on passing sanctions, we will act as a loyal ally should. But we do not pretend to welcome sanctions."
    In this way, the British ruling class, while making critical gestures, followed the American aggressors and repeatedly placed the unfriendly fait accompli towards China before the British people.
    The British people who love peace and advocate Sino-British friendship and peace must pay attention to this conspiracy of the British ruling class as a "loyal ally" of the American aggressors.

### 从一封慰问信谈起——旅英纪实之三

　　从一封慰问信谈起
    ——旅英纪实之三
    吴文焘“朋友们：
    我不知道你是否同意我寄一镑钱给你，表示我对中国人民志愿军的感谢。当我听到中国志愿军到了朝鲜去解救妇女和孩子们的苦难时，我的心才松快了。希望你能收转这个小小的礼物。
            艾米丽·瓦特逊
              一九五○年十一月十一日
    我不认识瓦特逊，只从“艾米丽”这个名字才知道写信者是一位女士或太太。她的信是由一个朋友转给我的。我十分珍重这封简朴的信，并认为它是千千万万英国老百姓的共同心声。
    很多英国朋友告诉我：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，在普遍的英国人民中间引起了极大的反感。对于美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上的挫败，很多人的议论是：“跋扈的美国佬们得到了应得的惩处！”去年十一月底，因遭受失败而发抖的杜鲁门，恫吓要在朝鲜战场上使用包括原子弹在内的一切武器，以扩大战争时，在英国首相官邸前，在下议院的长廊里，曾有列成很长队伍的产业工人、青年、妇女、医生……的代表，等候向政府首脑们递交意见书和会见他们选区的议员，表示抗议。无数的函电从全国各地汇到唐宁街十号（英国政府所在地），警告政府切勿卷入对中国的战争。工人们的集会甚至通过决议，如果华盛顿方面敢于使用原子弹，他们将以罢工来回敬。去年十二月三日，艾德礼匆匆飞往美国会晤杜鲁门时，代表六十万工人的伦敦工会代表会执行委员会以及其他人民团体和个人，又都打电报要求他在山姆大叔面前挺起腰板来。
    不用说，中国人民对于所有这些真诚的、人民大众的正义行动，是怀抱着崇高的敬意的。虽然英国工党政府追随美国侵略者对中国采取了很多不友好的行动，但中英两国广大人民的共同意愿是两大国家的和平友好。一九四九年十二月在伦敦成立的英中友好协会，就是英国人民这种意愿的鲜明表示。
    根据报纸记载，去年年底的群众运动，曾在伦敦政界引起了反应。百余名工党议员，包括工党主席阿丽丝·贝肯女士在内，共同提出了一个看来是对美国政府带批评性的声明，不久，在五个工党下院议员、一个工党上院议员和一个保守党下院议员参加下，出现了一个“对中国和平委员会”的团体。
    一月十五日，“对中国和平委员会”的发起人在曼彻斯特卫报登载了一个启事，说明该会成立的经过和宗旨：
    “全英国已为在朝鲜发生的事件及与中国作战的危险所严重惊动了。
    “本着竭尽可能来避免这个灾难的信念，最近约有二千五百人在‘对中国和平委员会’的召集下，在伦敦金斯卫尔会堂集会，通过决议，呼吁光荣的和解，承认中华人民共和国在安理会席位的权利，并重新肯定一九四五年波茨坦公告中关于台湾的决定。我们相信联合国斥北朝鲜为侵略者是正确的，并对中国的干涉表示惋惜（我们不同与上述信念相反的人联合），但是，我们认为我国政府（按指英政府）应继续在下列路线上采取主动：
    “（一）我们应加强我们的信心，即：开罗会议宣言、波茨坦公告关于台湾的决定对所有签字国有强制性。（二）我们应会同各自治领及联合国其他会员国，力求使中国进入安理会。（三）我们应对朝鲜战争的任何扩大表示反对。（四）我们应寻求朝鲜问题的早日公平解决，并依照联合国的意图与职权，建议成立统一独立的朝鲜。（五）我们应力求在联合国重新努力和解当前政治问题及考虑朝鲜经济恢复的明确方法上，充分与印度、巴基斯坦以及其他亚洲国家合作。”
    该会成立大会后的第二天（一月九日），曼彻斯特卫报这样报导说：“‘对中国和平委员会’的组织者们，显然是处心积虑地拟定了一个纲领，以便使共产党人及其同情者们不能进入该会的领导机关，也不能进入地方委员会去。他们（按指入会的人）必须声明同情‘联合国正确地斥北朝鲜为侵略者，联合国的军事行动是为了执行其权能来粉碎侵略、保证公平民主的解决……。’”
    接着，很多关心中英关系和世界和平的人，在“对中国和平委员会”发展分会的当儿，探询和要求该会与其他保卫和平的组织采取联合行动。这在“新政治家与民族”杂志的剳记栏里透露出来。可是，该刊三月十日以“批评家”署名的评论中，却给了否定的回答。同时，在和英国上院议员林赛爵士关于中国问题的论战中，英共副主席、“劳动月刊”总编辑杜德同志提到：“……如果我们要提倡英中友谊的话，我们必须试图使英国政府对其政策有所改变。我欢迎‘对中国和平委员会’和英中友好协会这类组织为此目的所作的努力。”（二月十七日曼彻斯特卫报）这段谈话引起了三个“对中国和平委员会”发起人——诺曼·鲍威尔（保守党议员）、亨利·卡特尔和索灵逊（工党议员）——断章取义的、无赖的声明：“……我们和英国共产党及其联合组织没有任何关系。因此，杜德先生表示欢迎本会的存在，似乎是在同意联合国斥责北朝鲜为侵略国的行动，这是很有趣味的。因为这种观点是加入本会的先决条件。”（三月五日曼彻斯特卫报。）
    在二月二十四日该会伦敦海姆斯台德区的大会上，一位叫玛格丽·福莱的全国委员会委员，解释该会意图“并非使政府为难。相反的，‘对中国和平委员会’所作的工作，是很可以帮助政府的。它将使英国的谈判者们在国际会议上提出某些政策来，说：‘我们没办法啊！由于在我国反对对中国作战的情绪如此强烈，我们必须不顾一切地来避免它……。’”
    福莱女士讲完话，前英外交部远东问题顾问约翰·普拉特爵士就对该会的纲领提出正面批评：
    “‘对中国和平委员会’的传单上说‘联合国正确地斥北朝鲜为侵略者’，我认为联合国这一举动是错误的，而且含有极严重的后果。联合国创造了这样一个先例，即：任何为美国所斥责的国家，不管事实如何，必须自动地被污为侵略国。我们从朝鲜开始，名单上的第二个就是中国，人人都知道：将近两年来，美国即自台湾对中国实行侵略，可是，我们在联合国的代表，却投票赞成污蔑中国为侵略国。我们被领导到这种屈辱和不名誉的地位，是由于我国人民未被告以真实情况，而知道真实情况的人们，又不愿面对现实。”（以上引文系根据普拉特在三月十三日曼彻斯特卫报上亲自订正过的讲辞）
    我相信普拉特的这段话，是戳到了“对中国和平委员会”的痛处。无论如何，污蔑北朝鲜为侵略者，是个弥天大谎，是不利于英国人民为中英友好和平及其切身利益而斗争的有效和联合行动的。不管主观动机如何，“对中国和平委员会”的领导人们是在纲领上为美帝国主义侵略者及其英国的帮凶们开了一个阴风飕飕的后门。我们看：在群情愤激的当中，艾德礼飞到华盛顿，并在与杜鲁门的联合公报中声明英美间对于中国问题的分歧，但患着软骨病的狮子，并未向飞鹰吼一声。在杜、艾会谈后不久，英国政府便跟着美国诽谤中国为“侵略者”。原来表示反对英政府这一直接与中国人民为敌的步骤的“对中国和平委员会”，就默认了这个“既成事实”，而转入表示反对制裁了。
    事实上，早在杜鲁门开动其在成功湖的表决机器以前，英国统治阶级就已同意了这个不名誉的诽谤。这可从英国垄断资本家们的刊物“经济学家”一月十三日的评论看出来。它说：
    “我们对于该事（按指污蔑中国事）并无异议……但是我们非常不喜欢对中国实行制裁的建议。制裁所要产生的害处，是显而易见的——它将牵连到对香港的并不是很小的冒险——但我们看不出利益来。我们认真地不相信制裁会使毛泽东改变其政策，或会对他有何特殊害处。正如我们过去的痛苦经验所证明的，实行不起作用的制裁，比之根本不实行制裁，最终会对联合国的威信破坏更大。因此，我们万分希望美国人不追求制裁的念头。这不是由于希望绥靖或对世界局势有任何缺乏现实的认识。恰恰相反，对于我们来说，不现实的态度，似乎是将一切注意和资源集中到远东。当然，保持与美国的合作是我们政策的基础，如果美国政府在听过所有这些论点后，坚持要通过制裁，我们将像一个忠实的同盟者所应表现的那样来行动。但我们并不装作欢迎制裁。”
    就是这样，英国的统治阶级一面作着批评的姿态，一面又追随着美国侵略者，把对华不友好的既成事实一次一次地摆在英国人民的面前。
    爱好和平和主张中英友好和平的英国人民，必须注意到作为美国侵略者的“忠实同盟者”的英国统治阶级的这种阴谋诡计。
