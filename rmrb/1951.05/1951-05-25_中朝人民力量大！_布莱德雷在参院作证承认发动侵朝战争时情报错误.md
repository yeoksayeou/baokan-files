　　The Power of the Chinese and Korean People is Immense!
    Bradley Admits to Intelligence Errors When Testifying in Senate About Launching the Korean War
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 24th] U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, admitted during his testimony in the Senate on the 22nd that the U.S. government made miscalculations regarding the strength of the Korean people and the friendship of the Chinese and Korean people when it launched the Korean War last June. He said, "No one thought that North Korea (referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) would be as strong as it later proved to be. Based on our intelligence, we underestimated their numbers, their equipment, and their combat capabilities." He said, "The possible participation of Communist China and Russia was also considered at the time, but no one thought that either of them would intervene."

    布莱德雷在参院作证承认发动侵朝战争时情报错误
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷二十二日在参议院作证时承认美国政府在去年六月发动侵朝战争时对朝鲜人民的力量和中朝人民患难与共的友谊估计错误。他说：“没有人想北朝鲜（指朝鲜民主主义人民共和国）会像后来事实证明的那样强大。我们根据我们的情报而低估了他们的人数、他们的装备、他们的作战能力。”他说：“当时也考虑了共产党中国与俄国可能的参战，然而没有人认为它们之中有任何一个会进行干涉。”
