　　People of All Ethnic Groups Love Chairman Mao
        The following folk songs are popular everywhere in Xinjiang Province:
        “Leader Mao Zedong saves us,
        We will never forget your kindness,
        Advance on your path,
        Strike the enemy.
        Long live Mao Zedong,
        Our loved one!”
           ——Xinjiang Kazakh folk song
        “The leader of the Party is Mao Zedong.
        Mao Zedong shines like the sun;
        From south to north, from west to east,
        Mao Zedong’s eyes are watching over us.
        We respectfully wish our leader Mao Zedong long life,
        May he shine like the sun and moon forever, illuminating the people.”
          ——Xinjiang Russian folk song
    On the Pamir Plateau, the roof of the world, and at the foot of the Altai Mountains on the northern border of the motherland, children of all ethnic groups in remote areas are still singing "The East is Red" and "Let's Go, Follow Mao Zedong!"
    What power has cultivated such great affection? As early as 1935, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, heading north to resist Japan, bravely traversed the snow-capped mountains and grasslands. A part of the West Route Army then trekked through the vast snow and entered Xinjiang Province via the Qilian Mountains. They, along with the Communists who later came to Xinjiang to mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in the rear to support the anti-Japanese front and lead the revolutionary movement of the people of Xinjiang, brought the voice of Chairman Mao to the people of all ethnic groups.
    Many of the cadres of all ethnic groups now spread throughout Xinjiang Province often say meaningfully that they are students of the Chinese Communist Lin Jilu (the former Dean of Studies of Xinjiang College, later murdered by the bandit Sheng Shicai). It was the Chinese Communists who showed them the correct path to national and ethnic liberation. After the liberation of Xinjiang, Liu Yurui, a worker at the Xinjiang Daily printing factory, took out the copperplate of Chairman Mao's photo, which he had kept for six years, and said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel rule could not sever the workers' love for Chairman Mao."
    Due to a series of measures taken by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government that were conducive to developing rural production and improving the lives of farmers, grain production in the province increased by more than 19 percent last year compared with the previous year, and cotton production increased by 6 percent. Gao Peiyuan, a poor peasant from Sandao Ba, Qiande County, exchanged two shi of rice for new clothes for his entire family of twelve and added new bedding after last year's autumn harvest. This was an unprecedented happy event for Gao Peiyuan's family.
    The people of all ethnic groups are united as never before. Last May, wind and sand filled 58 karez wells (underground water channels) in Turpan County. The people of all ethnic groups in the county immediately set to work digging wells. There were five karez wells in the first township of the first district. Four of them belonged to the Hui people, but more than 90 percent of the well diggers were Uyghur people. Hui compatriot Musa said with emotion: "In the past, our two ethnic groups often fought. Now that the Communist Party has come, we have become one family."
    The people's governments at all levels in Xinjiang Province have correctly implemented the trade policy of equivalent exchange, which has greatly increased the prices of agricultural and livestock products compared with the past. In December of the year before last, one bolt of blue serge in Dihua City could be exchanged for 2,113 jin of wheat or more than 402 jin of wool. In December of last year, each bolt of blue serge could only be exchanged for a little more than 204 jin of wheat or a little more than 43 jin of wool. Last year, the state-owned trading company increased the exchange rate of wool from 1.5 brick teas per 100 jin to 3.5 brick teas, and the exchange rate of sheepskins from 8 brick teas per 100 skins to 24 brick teas, which initially improved the lives of herdsmen. Urban industry and commerce have also developed. According to statistics from 37 counties and cities, there were a total of 53,091 industrial and commercial households in the early days of liberation. By the end of November last year, this number had increased to 56,807.
    The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang Province actively helped people of all ethnic groups to treat diseases and build water conservancy projects, which was praised and appreciated by people of all ethnic groups. During the Spring Festival, Hui women in Dihua City gave the soldiers of the People's Army "fragrant sachets," a gift that they usually only give to their husbands and sons who were going away.
    The people of all ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang also have one thing to thank the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government for, which is the story of building the famous Red Sea Reservoir in Bachu County. The reservoir was built in 1943 under the leadership of Li Zhiliang (a member of the Communist Party of China), the county magistrate of the county. It supplies irrigation and drinking water to the people living in the water-scarce Gobi Desert. Since the Sheng Shicai bandits threw the Chinese Communists into prison, the water source of the Red Sea has been seized by landlords and despots. The landlords and despots operated more than 70 water mills here, wasting the water on the Gobi Desert, causing the reservoir to gradually dry up. The farmers of Bachu County returned to the "years of irrigating the land with tears." They could only store ice and snow in winter as a beverage, so many farmers abandoned their homes and fled to other counties. At the beginning of last year, a unit of the People's Liberation Army repaired the Red Sea Reservoir and cooperated with the local people's government to reason with the landlords who operated the water mills, stipulating that landlords were not allowed to open water mills when farmers used water. The people of all ethnic groups in Bachu County said: "We can live with the Communist Party; without the Communist Party, we cannot live!" Farmers who had fled to other counties in the past also returned to their hometowns one after another.

　　各民族人民热爱毛主席
        在新疆省到处流行着这样的民歌：
        “领袖毛泽东拯救我们，
        我们永远不忘你的恩情，
        在你的道路上前进，
        打击敌人。
        万岁毛泽东，
        我们的亲人！”
           ——新疆哈萨克族民歌
        “党的领导者是毛泽东。
        毛泽东像太阳放光明；
        我们从南到北，从西到东，
        毛泽东的眼睛在看顾我们。
        我们敬祝领袖毛泽东万岁，
        天长地久像日月照耀人民。”
          ——新疆俄罗斯族民歌
    在世界屋脊帕米尔高原上，在祖国极北边疆阿尔泰山脚下，天边的各民族儿童们还唱着《东方红》和《走，跟着毛泽东走！》的歌曲。
    是什么力量培植了这种伟大的情感呢？远在一九三五年北上抗日的中国工农红军，不避艰难困苦，英勇地走完雪山草地后，西路军一部又踏着茫茫的积雪，经过祁连山进入新疆省。他们和以后到新疆发动后方各民族人民支持抗日前线、领导新疆人民革命运动的共产党人，就给各民族人民带来了毛主席的声音。
    现在遍布新疆省各地的各民族干部，有的常会语意深长地说，他们是中国共产党人林基路（原新疆学院教务长，后为盛世才匪徒杀害）的学生。是中国共产党人，向他们指明了什么是祖国和民族解放的正确道路。新疆解放后，新疆日报印刷厂的工友刘玉瑞，拿出他保存了六年之久的毛主席照片的铜版说：“国民党反动派残酷的统治，割不断工人热爱毛主席的心。”
    由于中国共产党和人民政府采取了一系列有利于发展农村生产，改善农民生活的各种措施，使去年该省粮食的产量较前年增加了百分之十九强，皮棉增产百分之六。乾德县三道坝贫农高培元，在去年秋收后，曾以两石大米换了全家十二口人穿的新衣，还增添了新被褥。这是高培元家从来没有过的喜事。
    各民族人民是空前团结起来了。去年五月间，风沙填塞了吐鲁番县的五十八个坎井（地下水渠），该县各民族人民即一齐动手挖井。第一区第一乡共有五个坎井。其中有四个井是回民的，但挖井的人百分之九十以上是维吾尔族人。回族同胞穆沙感动地说：“过去我们两族人民经常打架，现在共产党来了，我们已经成了一家人。”
    新疆省各级人民政府正确地执行了等价交换的贸易政策，使农业、畜牧品的价格比以前大为提高。前年十二月迪化市的一匹青斜纹布可换小麦两千一百一十三市斤，或羊毛四百零二市斤强。去年十二月每匹青斜纹布仅能换小麦二百零四市斤强，或羊毛四十三市斤强。去年国营贸易公司将羊毛由每百斤折换一块半砖茶提至三块半，每百张羊皮也由折换八块砖茶提至二十四块，使牧民生活得到初步的改善。城市的工商业也有了发展。据三十七个县市的统计，在解放初期共有工商户五万三千零九十一家，去年十一月底，已增至五万六千八百零七户。
    驻新疆省各地的人民解放军积极帮助各民族人民治病和兴修水利，受到各民族人民的称颂和感激。迪化市回族妇女在春节中，曾以她们习俗只赠给出远门的丈夫、儿子的礼物“香包”，赠给人民军队的战士。
    南疆各民族人民还有一件感激人民解放军和人民政府的事情，就是关于修筑巴楚县著名的红海水库的故事。这水库是一九四三年在该县县长李志良（中共党员）的主持下修筑的，它供给着居住在缺水的大戈壁上人民的灌溉和饮用。自盛世才匪徒把中国共产党人投入监狱后，红海的水源就被地主恶霸霸占了。地主恶霸在这里经营了七十余盘水磨，把水白白放到戈壁滩上，致使水库逐渐干涸。巴楚县的农民又重回到“用眼泪浇地的岁月”，他们只有储蓄冬季的冰雪作为饮料，因而有许多农民抛弃了自己的家园向外县逃荒。去年年初，人民解放军某部将红海水库重行整修后，并协同地方人民政府向经营水磨的地主说理，规定农民用水时，地主不准开水磨。巴楚县各民族人民说：“有了共产党，我们才能活；没有共产党，我们就活不了！”过去逃荒外县的农民也纷纷重返故乡。
