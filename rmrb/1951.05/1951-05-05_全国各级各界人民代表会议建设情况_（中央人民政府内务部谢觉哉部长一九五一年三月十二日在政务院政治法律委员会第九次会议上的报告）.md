On the Construction of People's Representative Conferences at All Levels Nationwide
(Report by Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, at the Ninth Meeting of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council on March 12, 1951)

    I. As of now, among the 28 provinces and 8 administrative regions equivalent to provinces nationwide, the following 23 provinces have held Provincial People's Representative Conferences: Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Rehe, Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Yunnan. The Suiyuan Province is currently holding its conference. The following seven administrative regions have held People's Representative Conferences: Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan. The aforementioned provinces and regions have all established Consultative Committees, and 18 provinces have elected Provincial People's Governments. All 13 centrally and great administrative region-controlled cities, 77 provincial and administrative region-controlled cities, and towns with populations over 30,000 nationwide have held Municipal (or Township) People's Representative Conferences, and 30 cities have already exercised the functions and powers of People's Congresses on behalf of the People's Congresses. Out of the 2,068 counties nationwide, 1,961 counties have held County People's Representative Conferences, accounting for 94.8 percent of the total number of counties (only 82.5 percent during the National Civil Affairs Conference in July 1950). Additionally, out of 58 banners, 46 banners have held Banner People's Representative Conferences, accounting for 79.3 percent. Ninety counties and five banners have exercised the functions and powers of People's Congresses on behalf of the People's Congresses. Twenty-three counties have held People's Congresses. There are 33 administrative regions equivalent to counties nationwide—industrial and mining areas, directly subordinate districts, and establishment bureaus—and 10 of them have convened People's Representative Conferences. Out of the 61 districts of centrally and great administrative region-controlled cities, 47 have convened District People's Representative Conferences. In rural districts and townships (administrative villages), old liberated areas have generally held Township (Administrative Village) People's Representative Conferences, and some have held People's Congresses; most new liberated areas have held Peasant Representative Conferences, and some have convened People's Representative Conferences. In areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, most have convened All Ethnic Groups and All Circles People's Representative Conferences or Ethnic Unity Conferences, and some have established regional autonomous governments.

    Each level of meetings has not yet established a regular system, but the number of meetings held is considerable. According to incomplete statistics, the number of counties nationwide that have convened People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the past year or more: approximately 60 percent have held three or more meetings; counties in old liberated areas (North China, Northeast) have generally held four or more meetings, while new liberated areas such as the Southwest have mostly held one meeting. Central and great administrative region-controlled municipalities have held as many as six meetings and as few as three, generally four. Most provincial and special district-controlled cities have held four or more meetings.

    II. "State power belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses at all levels and the people's governments at all levels." The Chinese people have already seized political power, and now the question is how the people exercise their power. The experience of the past year proves that in areas liberated by the People's Liberation Army, promptly creating conditions to convene People's Representative Conferences of All Circles to promote understanding and unity between the government and the people has achieved brilliant results, and "before the convening of local people's congresses through universal suffrage, local people's representative conferences gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses" is very suitable for the situation and the demands of the people in various regions. In fact, the correct resolutions or criticisms of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles that have not exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congresses have been accepted by the People's Governments without exception. At the end of each meeting, a review is generally conducted to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the meeting: because there is no experience, shortcomings are inevitable; and precisely because there is no experience, it is possible to continuously create new methods and approaches. Shortcomings, once pointed out, are rarely repeated; advantages are rapidly promoted. Therefore, the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at all levels are generally held well, and each subsequent meeting is better than the previous one. The mutual understanding between cadres and the people and the understanding of the exercise of political power are rapidly improved through practical action. The New Democratic "people's democratic united front regime led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance," composed of "the Chinese working class, peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements," practicing democracy toward the people and exercising dictatorship over the enemies of the people, is no longer written on paper or spoken, but has entered the actual actions of the people.

    III. In the experience of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at all levels in which the people exercise political power, there are many matters that should be noted by the People's Governments at all levels and are worth mentioning:

    First, the people want political power in order to have the power to handle their own affairs and the affairs of the country, first and foremost to use their power to remove the oppression and poverty imposed on them during the reactionary rule. Therefore, discussions on suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, abolishing the Baojia system, reducing rent, reducing interest, returning deposits, land reform, production, disaster relief, resisting America and aiding Korea, etc., at the People's Representative Conferences are extremely welcomed by the people. The effectiveness is particularly significant when higher-level governments consciously submit various tasks to the People's Representative Conferences for discussion and decision-making. For example, some provinces issued instructions on "Strengthening Democratic Political Construction by Combining with Land Reform," exposing the reactionary crimes of the landlord class at the County and Township People's Representative Conferences, organizing peasants to speak out about their sufferings, raising their class consciousness, and at the same time studying land policies and formulating plans for implementing land reform, and electing Land Reform Committees. Their land reform work was thorough, and few left or right deviations occurred. As another example, in some urban districts, taking "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" as the central theme of the District People's Representative Conference immediately transformed into the actual actions of people from all walks of life in Resisting America and Aiding Korea. In some places, after discussions at the representative conferences on "Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries," exposing the evil deeds of bad people and purging infiltrated bad elements, especially inviting representatives to participate in public trials of bandit leaders by the People's Courts during the representative conference process, could greatly enhance popular morale and make people feel the preciousness of holding political power in their own hands. As for discussing production issues, discussing relief issues, and discussing running schools, everything that is of vital interest to the people not only demonstrates the people's love for the power they have obtained, but also demonstrates the greatness of the people's strength and the diversity of their wisdom. Some cadres said, "The people have so many ideas!" Others said, "I didn't expect them to be so bold!"

    Second, the people's participation in political construction is not only satisfied with convening representative conferences, but also requires the people to have various organizations to serve as the foundation for political construction. Some townships or towns started by organizing and rectifying people's organizations. Before convening the representative conference, they had already done a lot of work that was beneficial to the people and against the enemy. Therefore, their representative conference was held very naturally and well.

    Third, the People's Governments of townships and urban districts have very few cadres and do a lot of work. "Township cadres are hard to be," seems to be something that cannot be helped. But the people have so many ideas! Many townships or urban districts that have convened People's Representative Conferences have decided on solutions and at the same time decided how to do them. Doing requires organization. Therefore, below the urban districts, in addition to various professional organizations, they have created residents' groups, residents' committees, welfare committees, etc., and in rural areas, there are residents' groups, "pian'er hui" (group meetings), regular or temporary various work committees, etc., attracting various active elements among the residents to participate. This method becomes more obvious the lower the level. Village cadres in the Northeast said: Convening representative conferences, explaining the work clearly, and then representatives mobilizing the residents, everyone worked hard, and it was immediately successful. Therefore, there were especially many meetings during production and support for the war.

    Fourth, the government's honest reporting of the advantages and disadvantages of important work at the representative conference can not only deepen the people's trust in the government, but also serve as a good form of supervision for government staff. Representatives speaking freely about their criticisms or suggestions to the government, and the government being able to accept them sincerely or provide explanations, can not only correct certain deviations of cadres, but also make the people and cadres more united.

    Naturally, it is not easy to inspire representatives to speak fully. People who have been oppressed for a long time are a little hesitant when they suddenly stand up as masters. Li Baorong, a peddler representative from Taizhou, said: "I have participated in four meetings in a row. The first time was 'listening to the meeting,' the second time was 'saying good things,' the third time was 'conducting criticism,' and the fourth time was 'speaking boldly and expressing my opinions freely.'" This tells us that it is wrong to prevent people from speaking, and it is also wrong to be satisfied with someone speaking at the meeting.

    Fifth, the breadth and seriousness of the composition of representatives are increasingly strengthened. Here are just two examples: In the generation of representatives for the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the representatives of various state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and the representatives of colleges above the specialized level have achieved direct election by the electorate with the production unit or school as the unit; peasant representatives, industrial and commercial representatives, youth representatives, women representatives, and regional representatives have generally achieved election by the representative conference. The above two types of representatives have reached 83 percent of the total number of representatives. Also, in Harbin, among the 369 municipal representatives, there were no unemployed people. Among the 1,210 representatives of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the city's districts, there were only 29 unemployed people. Here it can be seen that the representatives truly represent the people engaged in various physical labor, mental labor, and work beneficial to the country and society.

    Sixth, holding meetings, making proposals, discussing, electing, and voting, are all forming a set of beneficial and simple methods in various places. The formalism of old democracy is not working.

    Seventh, the political construction of ethnic minorities is developing in a way that suits their needs. They are very excited about ethnic regional autonomy and very happy to be able to express their demands in their own language. New phenomena are appearing before them: such as the improvement of their relationships with each other (such as the reconciliation of many grasslands ethnic groups in Qinghai who hated each other and the Yi people in Xikang who fought against each other); the improvement of their relationship with the Han people (saying that the current Han cadres are not scary but lovable); their self-confidence is also increasing (a Miao representative said: In the past, we thought we were backward and could not manage things, but now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we know that we can do it too). At the same time, their lives are also improving with their political power.

    The gains from the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at all levels in the past year cannot be fully described. The above is just a glimpse. Generally speaking, the People's Representative Conferences in provinces and large cities have become more and more proficient, and the unity between the people and the government is closer. Recently, the People's Representative Conferences in townships and cities in Beijing and other places have created many new experiences and methods. The County People's Representative Conference has become the key to conveying policies, summarizing experiences, and leading the work of the entire county.

    IV. Some incorrect views on political construction work that were pointed out and criticized at the National Civil Affairs Conference last year, such as: regarding the People's Representative Conference as parallel to other work, thinking that it can only be convened when there is time; regarding convening a meeting as a task assigned by the higher authorities, convening it when the higher authorities urge it, and putting it aside when they don't; being afraid of holding the People's Representative Conference, thinking that it is difficult to handle things with more democracy; government personnel not valuing the meeting, not attending the meeting, or having an unserious attitude when attending; regarding the representative conference as a cadre meeting, with the government assigning tasks and the representatives accepting them; not being democratic, suppressing speeches; not being happy with representatives making criticisms of the government's work; not preparing well for the meeting; not respecting the resolutions, and not mentioning the implementation of the previous resolution at the next meeting; the composition of representatives not being broad or having unqualified people mixed in, etc., have all received lessons in the face of facts. They are being corrected, and they are not allowed not to be corrected. The great people are grasping their own destiny in the posture of masters and moving forward by leaps and bounds.

    V. However, there are still many shortcomings in political construction work. For example: Although the good phenomena mentioned above are developing, they are not universal, and there is a great imbalance in various regions; the understanding that the People's Representative Conference is the basic work of organizing the state and should become a regular system is still insufficient in various places; there is insufficient promotion of democracy at the meeting or a lack of skill in using democracy; individual regions still do not attach importance to political construction work, and have not conducted essential democratic and dictatorial political construction education for cadres at all levels; they are eager to conduct universal suffrage without considering objective and practical conditions; especially important is the lack of timely sorting out and promotion of many new creations—methods, experiences, and achievements—of the People's Representative Conferences in various places; as for consciously discovering and creating new methods and experiences, less attention is paid to it.

    In order to cooperate with the country's preparation for the implementation of planned economic construction, political construction work must be further strengthened, correcting the bad and promoting the good. Vice Chairman Liu said: "New Democratic economic construction must be led and guaranteed by a New Democratic regime. Without New Democratic politics, there can be no New Democratic economy, that is, there can be no economy combining five economic components led by the socialist state-owned economy. This is also a prominent feature that distinguishes our New Democratic revolution from the bourgeois revolutions of the past. Before the establishment of the bourgeois revolution, that is, the bourgeois regime, the capitalist economy existed and developed. However, the New Democratic economy led by the socialist state-owned economy can only be organized and developed after the establishment of the New Democratic state regime led by the working class. The construction of the New Democratic regime, the development of the people's democratic regime, the democratization of our country, and the New Democratic economic construction, the development of the people's economic cause, and the industrialization of our country are inseparable." This means that the people must be widely and closely organized into the people's democratic dictatorship regime, and only in this way "can the New Democratic economic development and national industrialization be guaranteed."

    Therefore, we must achieve the following within this year: We must convene People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at all levels on schedule to form a regular system; we must create conditions as soon as possible to enable the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at all levels to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congresses on behalf of the People's Congresses, and elect People's Governments at all levels, especially the Municipal and County People's Governments; cities with populations of more than 100,000 should convene District People's Representative Conferences; adjust district and township administrative divisions; establish and improve basic organizations below the district level; various provinces and regions should continue to conduct typical experiments, collect and create new methods and experiences in political construction; strengthen the work of the Provincial and Municipal Consultative Committees and the County Standing Committees; and in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, convene People's Representative Conferences of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles to promote ethnic regional autonomy.

    Finally, in order to ensure the smooth progress of political construction work, a large number of cadres must be trained. I strongly agree with Secretary-General Tao Xijin's proposal to train political and legal cadres. The central government must train them, and the major administrative regions and provinces must also train them. The targets of the training are the existing civil affairs cadres, the active workers and peasants who have emerged in the land reform, and the revolutionary intellectuals. It is required to gradually ensure that some of the administrative cadres of each county (city) have received training from the major administrative regions and provinces, and that at least one person has received training at the central level.

　　全国各级各界人民代表会议建设情况
   （中央人民政府内务部谢觉哉部长一九五一年三月十二日在政务院政治法律委员会第九次会议上的报告）
    一、截至现在止，全国二十八个省和八个相当于省的行政区，已开过省各界人民代表会议的有：吉林、松江、黑龙江、辽东、辽西、热河、河北、察哈尔、山西、平原、山东、浙江、河南、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、江西、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、云南等二十三个省，绥远省现正在开；已开过行政区各界人民代表会议的有：苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北、川南、川西、川北等七区。上述省、区均成立了协商委员会，内十八个省选出了省人民政府。全国十三个中央和大行政区辖市、七十七个省和行政区辖市及三万以上人口的城镇，均已开过市（或镇）的各界人民代表会议，内三十个市已代行了人民代表大会的职权。全国二○六八个县，已有一九六一个县开过县各界人民代表会议，占总县数百分之九十四点八（一九五○年七月全国民政会议时只占百分之八十二点五）。另有五十八个旗，内四十六个旗开过旗各界人民代表会议，占百分之七十九点三。已代行人民代表大会职权的县有九十个，旗有五个。有二十三个县已开过人民代表大会。相当于县的行政区——工矿区、直属区、设治局等全国计有三十三个，有十个召开了各界人民代表会议。中央及大行政区辖市的区六十一个，内四十七个召开了区各界人民代表会议。农村区、乡（行政村），老区一般都开过乡（行政村）人民代表会议，有的开了人民代表大会；新区大都开过农民代表会议，有的召开了人民代表会议。在少数民族聚居地区，大都召开了各族各界人民代表会议或民族联谊会，有的成立了区域自治政府。
    各级召开会议，虽还没有建立经常制度，但开的次数却不少。据不完全的统计，一年多以来全国已召开各界人民代表会议的县：开三次会议以上的约占百分之六十；老区（华北、东北）的县一般开了四次以上，新区如西南，开一次的居多。中央及大行政区直辖市多的开了六次，少的开了三次，一般是四次。省、专区辖市开四次以上的居多。
    二、“国家政权属于人民。人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府”，中国人民已取得政权了，现在是人民如何行使政权的问题。一年来的经验证明：凡人民解放军已解放的地区，从速创造条件，召开各界人民代表会议，促进政府与人民的了解与团结，得到了辉煌成绩，而“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界代表会议逐步地代行人民代表大会的职权”，更非常适合各地情况与人民的要求。事实上未代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议，他们正确的决议或批评亦无不为人民政府所接受。每次会议结束，一般都做了检讨，指出会议的优点与缺点：因为没有经验，缺点在所难免；也正因没有经验，就能不断地创新的办法与方式。缺点经过指出，很少重犯；优点则在迅速发扬。因此，各级各界人民代表会议，总是开得好的多，下次会议总比上次开的好。干部与人民的相互了解和对行使政权的认识，经过实际的行动而迅速提高。新民主主义的“以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的”、组成“中国工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子的人民民主统一战线的政权”，对人民实行民主，对人民敌人实行专政，已不是纸上写、口头说，而是已进入了人民的实际行动里面。
    三、在人民行使政权的各级各界人民代表会议的经验中，有许多各级人民政府所应注意而值得提出的事：
    第一、人民要政权，为的是有权力来办自己的和国家的事，首先是用自己的权力来解除反动统治时期加于他们身上的压迫和贫困。因此，在人民代表会议上讨论剿匪、反霸、废除保甲、减租、减息、退押、土地改革、生产、救灾、抗美援朝等工作，极为人民所欢迎，上级政府有意识地把各种工作提交人民代表会议讨论并作出决定，其成效尤为显著，比如：有的省发了《结合土地改革加强民主建政工作》的指示，在县及乡人民代表会议上揭发了地主阶级的反动罪恶，组织农民诉苦，提高其阶级觉悟，同时又学习了土地政策，制定实施土地改革的方案，选出土地改革委员会，他们的土地改革工作就做得彻底，很少发生左或右的偏差。又如，有的城市区，以抗美援朝为区人民代表会议中心议题，马上即变为各界人民抗美援朝的实际行动。又有的地方经过代表会议讨论“镇压反革命”，揭发坏人恶迹，清洗混入的坏分子，尤其在代表会议的过程中请代表们参加人民法庭公审匪首，都能使民气大伸，感到政权握在自己手里的可贵，至于讨论生产问题，讨论救济问题，讨论办学校问题，一切与人民有切身利害的事，不仅表现人民对自己已获得的权力的爱护，而且表现人民力量的伟大与智慧的多样，有些干部说：“老百姓的办法真多！”有的则说：“没料到他们竟这样大胆！”
    第二、人民对于建政，不只是满足于召开代表会议，还需要人民有各种组织，来做建政的基础。有的乡或市镇，先从组织与整顿人民团体入手，在召开代表会议以前，已做了不少对敌人斗争及于人民有利的工作，因而其代表会议开的很自然而且好。
    第三、乡及城市区的人民政府，他们干部很少，做的工作很多，“乡干部难当”，似是没有办法的事。但人民的办法多的很！许多开了人民代表会议的乡或城市的区，决定了办法，同时又决定了怎样做，做就要有组织，于是城市区以下，除各职业团体外，创出了居民小组、居民委员会、福利委员会等，乡村则有居民小组、片儿会、经常的或临时的各种工作委员会等，吸引居民中各种积极分子参加。这个办法，越到下级，表现越明显。东北的村干部说：开代表会议，把工作说清，经过代表推动居民，大家起劲干，一下就成功了。所以生产及支援战争时，会开的特多。
    第四、政府在代表会议上，把重要工作优点缺点忠实地报告，不仅能加深人民对政府的信任，并且对政府工作人员是一种很好的督促。代表们言所欲言地对政府批评或建议，政府能开诚接受或予以说明，不止能纠正某些干部的偏差，且能使人民与干部更加团结。
    自然，要启发代表们充分发言，是不容易的，长期受压迫的人民，忽然起来作主人，开始总有点顾忌。泰州摊贩代表李保荣说：“我接连参加了四次会议，第一次是‘听会’，第二次是‘说好话’，第三次是‘开展批评’，第四次才是‘大胆说话，畅所欲言’。”这里告示我们：妨碍人家说话是不对，而以为会上有人说话就满足，也是不对。
    第五、代表成份的广泛性与严肃性，越来越加强了。这里只举两个例子：北京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表的产生，各公营工矿企业的代表，专科以上学校的代表，已做到以生产或学校为单位，由选民大会直接选举；农民代表、工商界、青年、妇女代表和区域代表等，已普遍做到由代表会议选举。以上两类代表，已达代表总数的百分之八十三。又哈尔滨市，市代表三六九名内，没有无职业的，该市各区各界人民代表会议代表共一千二百一十名，其中无职业者也仅二十九名。这里可见代表们所代表的，真是各体力劳动、脑力劳动与从事于国家社会有益工作的人民。
    第六、开会、提案、讨论、选举、表决，各地都在形成一套有益的简便的方法，旧民主的形式主义吃不开了。
    第七、少数民族的建政，正以适合他们的要求而发展。他们对区域的民族自治甚感兴奋，对能用自己的话说出自己的要求，非常高兴。在他们面前的新的现象：如他们彼此间的关系在改善（如青海草地民族互相仇恨、西康夷民打冤家的已和了不少）；对汉族关系也在改善（说现在的汉人干部不是可怕而是可爱）；他们的自信心也在增长（某苗人代表说：以前以为我们落后，不能管事，现在在毛主席领导下，知道我们也行）。同时，他们的生活，也随着他们的已有了权力，而正在改善。
    一年来各级各界人民代表会议的收获不能尽述，上面仅举其一斑。一般说来，省及大城市的人民代表会议，已一次一次的更熟练，人民与政府的团结更密切。最近北京市及其他各地的乡及城市的人民代表会议均创造了不少新的经验及方法。县的人民代表会议则已成为传达政策总结经验领导全县工作的枢机。
    四、去年全国民政会议上曾经指出过与批评过的一些封建政工作不正确的观点，如：把人民代表会议和其他工作并列着看待，认为要有工夫才召开；把召开会议当作上级交下的任务，上级催就开，不催就搁下；怕开人民代表会议，民主多了，事难办；政府人员不重视会议，不到会，或到会的态度不严肃；把代表会议当作干部会，政府布置工作，代表们接受任务；不民主，压制发言；不高兴代表们对政府工作提出批评；没有很好的做会议准备；不尊重决议，下次会议提不出上次决议执行情况；代表成份不广泛或混入有不合资格的人等。这些都在事实面前得到了教训。正在纠正，也不容许不纠正。伟大的人民，正以主人翁的姿态，掌握自己的命运，大踏步地向前进。
    五、但是，建政工作存在的缺点还多，比如：上面说的良好的现象，虽在发展，但并不普遍，各地区有很大的不平衡状态；各地对人民代表会议是组织国家的基本工作，应成为经常制度的认识，还很不够；会议上发扬民主不够或不善于运用民主；个别地区还未重视建政工作，对各级干部没有进行切要的民主专政的建政教育；不顾客观实际条件，急于进行普选；尤其重要的是对各地人民代表会议许多新的创造——方法、经验和成绩，缺乏及时的整理、推广；至于有意识的去发现与创造新的方法及经验，重视的还少。
    为着配合全国准备实行有计划的经济建设，建政工作必须更进一步的加强，纠正不好的，发扬好的。刘副主席说：“新民主主义的经济建设必须有新民主主义的政权来领导和保障，没有新民主主义的政治，就不能有新民主主义的经济，即不能有以社会主义的国营经济为领导的五种经济成份相结合的经济。这也是我们的新民主主义革命区别于过去资产阶级革命的一个显著特点。在资产阶级革命即资产阶级政权建立以前，就存在着并发展着资本主义经济，但是以社会主义的国营经济为领导的新民主主义经济，就只有在以工人阶级为领导的新民主主义的国家政权建立之后，才能加以组织并使之发展。新民主主义的政权建设，人民民主政权的发展，我们国家的民主化和新民主主义的经济建设，人民经济事业的发展，我们国家的工业化，是不能分离的。”这就是说，必须把人民广泛地与密切地组织到人民民主专政的政权里，只有这样“才能保障新民主主义的经济发展和国家工业化”。
    因此，我们要在今年内做到：必须按期召开各级各界人民代表会议，使之形成经常制度；尽速创造条件，使各级各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权，选举各级人民政府，特别是市、县人民政府；十万人口以上的城市，均应召开区各界人民代表会议；调整区乡行政区划。建立与健全区以下的基层组织；各省区继续做典型试验，收集与创造新的建政的方法与经验；加强省、市协商委员会和县常务委员会的工作；在少数民族聚居的地区，召开各族各界人民代表会议，推行民族的区域自治。
    最后，为使建政工作顺利进行，必须大批的训练干部，我很同意陶希晋秘书长训练政法干部的提议，中央要训练，各大行政区、省也要训练，训练的对象为现有的民政干部、土地改革中涌现的工农积极分子以及革命知识分子。要求逐步做到每县（市）的行政干部有些受过大行政区、省的训练，并且至少有一人来中央受过训。
