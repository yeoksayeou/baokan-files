　　Shanxi Organizes Sales Teams for Successful Distant Sales of Native Products
    Native Produce Company Sells Out Entire Stock
    The native produce sales teams dispatched by the Shanxi Provincial Native Produce Company successfully sold 1,200 tons of native products in the two months before mid-March. This included 350 tons of previously slow-selling items such as peach kernels, gypsum, and medicinal materials. The company's inventory from before February has been completely sold out.

    Many of Shanxi's native products had previously experienced slow sales due to changes in China's trade relations with capitalist countries. The Shanxi Provincial Native Produce Company also had passive and inactive shortcomings in its business operations, resulting in large stocks of native products and a lack of capital turnover. To expand domestic sales of native products, the Shanxi Provincial Native Produce Company dispatched five native produce sales teams to Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Zhengzhou, and Suiyuan on January 11th of this year. These teams discovered that many of Shanxi's native products were essential production and living materials needed by the people of these areas. After the teams' active promotion, many of Shanxi's native products have transformed from slow-selling to in-demand. For example, alum is one of the raw materials needed for making vermicelli in Suiyuan Province and for papermaking in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places, with a large demand. Gypsum is urgently needed for construction projects in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Tangshan, and other places. The Jiangnan Cement Plant in Shanghai alone ordered 5,000 tons of green gypsum from the Shanxi native produce sales team. Long-stockpiled and slow-moving goods, such as Lianqiao (Forsythia), Wu Jiapi (Acanthopanax bark), and Yuanzhi (Polygala root) medicinal materials, were also sold in large quantities to Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangdong, and Guangxi by the sales teams.

    While promoting native products, the sales teams also investigated and studied the supply and demand patterns, quality, and specifications of native products in various markets. For example, the sales team stationed in Tianjin sent people to Dalian and discovered sulfur being sold in the apple market. After in-depth investigation, they learned that sulfur is essential for washing apple trees and understood that the use of sulfur to wash apple trees in the Dalian area is done in the spring. Another example is that the sales teams found that Shanxi white melon seeds were needed in the markets of Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangdong, but only the smooth-edged ones were acceptable, while the fuzzy-edged ones were not. Huangqi (Astragalus root) also has a large market, but Hankou and Jiangxi require the gray variety, Guangdong requires the black variety, and Guangxi requires the light black variety. Shanxi white Dangshen (Codonopsis pilosula) used to be sold in Hankou, but in recent years, red Dangshen has become popular in Hankou. Understanding these situations greatly helped the promotion of Shanxi native products.

    The Shanxi native produce sales teams also conducted native product exchanges with state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, or private merchants in various places. The team stationed in Suiyuan sold two train cars of red dates and exchanged them for 20 heads of livestock on the spot, which were brought back to Shanxi just in time for spring plowing. At the same time, the team also signed a contract with the Suiyuan State-owned Trading Company to exchange Shanxi alum for Suiyuan livestock. The teams sent to Shanghai and Hankou are also preparing to exchange Shanxi's gypsum, medicinal materials, and other native products for southern bamboo products, porcelain, and Yu Kou paper. In this way, the efforts of the sales teams have greatly promoted the exchange of native products between Shanxi and other regions.

### 山西组织远销小组远销土产成功  土产公司存货销售一空

　　山西组织远销小组远销土产成功
    土产公司存货销售一空
    山西省土产公司派出的土产远销小组，在三月中旬以前的两个月内推销土产一千二百吨，其中包括以前滞销的桃仁、石膏、药材等三百五十吨。该公司二月份以前的存货已经销售一空。
    山西省好些土产曾因我国对资本主义国家贸易情况变动而滞销。山西省土产公司在业务经营上也曾有消极、被动的缺点，因此库存大量土产，资金周转不灵。为了扩大土产内销，山西省土产公司就在今年一月十一日派出五个土产远销小组，到上海、天津、汉口、郑州和绥远等地活动。这些小组发现山西省很多土产都是上述各地人民所需要的生产和生活资料。经小组积极推销后，山西不少土产已由滞销一变而为供不应求。例如白矾是绥远省做粉条和上海、天津、汉口等地造纸用的原料之一，需要量很大；石膏是上海、天津、汉口、唐山等地建筑工程急需的东西，上海江南水泥厂一下子就向山西土产远销小组订购了青石膏五千吨。积存很久的冷货，如连壳、五加皮、远志等药材，也由远销小组大量推销到天津、上海、汉口和广东、广西各地。
    远销小组一面推销土产，一面调查、研究了各地市场土产的供求规律和质量、规格。如派驻天津的远销小组派人到大连活动，在苹果市上发现有卖硫磺的，深入调查以后，知道苹果树必需用硫磺刷洗，同时了解了大连一带用硫磺刷苹果树是在春季。又如远销小组发现山西白瓜籽为上海、汉口和广东各地市场所需要，但须是光边的，毛边的根本不行。黄芪也有广大市场，但是汉口、江西要灰色的，广东要黑色的，广西要浅黑色的。山西白条党参从前可销汉口，近年来汉口却风行红条党参。这些情况的了解对山西土产的推销帮助极大。
    山西土产远销小组又和各地国营贸易公司、合作社或私商进行了土产交换。派驻绥远的小组售出红枣两车皮，就地换回牲畜二十头，带回山西刚好赶上春耕。该小组同时又和绥远国营贸易公司签订了山西白矾交换绥远牲畜的合同。派去上海和汉口的小组也已准备以山西的石膏、药材等土产交换南方竹器、磁器和玉扣纸等。这样，远销小组的努力也大大促进了山西和各地之间的土产交流。
