Xinhua News Agency Report: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government continued to arrest a group of extremely heinous counter-revolutionaries on April 27th. The entire city of Shanghai celebrated and cheered this action. Democratic parties and people's organizations in Shanghai issued joint statements and declarations, demanding severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries and calling on the people to assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionaries.

　　Among the arrested counter-revolutionaries, some were armed special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and murderers. For example, Lu Xingsheng, known as one of the "Four Tyrants," who had killed countless people, was the "Deputy Commander of the 4th Column and Commander of the 1st Detachment of the Bandit 'Jiangnan People's Anti-Communist Assault Army.'" From 1942 to 1944, Lu Bandit killed nearly a thousand residents in rural Wujin area of ​​Southern Jiangsu, and took more than twenty women as his wives and concubines by force. After the liberation of Jiangnan, Lu Bandit fled to Taiwan. This time he sneaked back to Shanghai to cause trouble and was captured by us.

　　Some were special agents and bandits who resisted registration or continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after registration. For example, Tong Xiang, a special agent of the Kuomintang "Military Statistics Bureau," served as the special commissioner of the Southeast District and the head of the Zhejiang Station of the "Military Statistics Bureau." During the Anti-Japanese War, he persecuted the people in the Quzhou, Jinhua, and Jiangshan areas, causing many bloody incidents. He participated in the massacre at the "Quzhou Concentration Camp," and his whole body was stained with the blood of the people. After the Japanese surrender, Tong Bandit relied on the power of the "Military Statistics Bureau" to seize merchant ships and civilian houses. After liberation, Tong Bandit showed no remorse and continued to engage in sabotage activities.

　　Still others were Chiang Kai-shek's special agents lurking in factories to carry out sabotage activities. Zhang Ziheng, a special agent lurking in the Shanghai Gas Company, was an important cadre of the special agent leader Lu Jingshi. He served as the "Chief of the Intelligence Section" and "Deputy Captain of the Workers' Protection Brigade" of the bandit "Police Bureau." Before liberation, he repeatedly drew up blacklists and led the capture of patriotic workers such as Yu Changsheng and others. He was one of the main culprits in the Quanggong Building Massacre (February 9, 1947). On the eve of liberation, he burned a large number of reactionary documents in the Nanjing Road Telephone Company in an attempt to eliminate evidence. At the time of liberation, he impersonated a staff member of the People's Government to carry out sabotage. After liberation, he secretly engaged in activities and resisted registration.

　　There were also counter-revolutionaries who were lurking in schools to carry out sabotage. For example, Liu Boheng served as a member of the Executive Committee of the 11th District Party Department of the Kuomintang in Shanghai. Before liberation, he monopolized lawsuits and extorted money. He once instructed special agents to arrest patriotic education workers Xu Jintao, Gui Dequ, and Zhou Yude. After liberation, Liu Bandit pretended to be progressive and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

　　There was also a group of evil bullies who had harmed the people. For example, Ye Qingyi, an evil landlord who fled from Taixian County in Northern Jiangsu to Shanghai, used his power to bully and rape women, committing all kinds of evil deeds in the past. He often took the "Self-Defense Force" and the bandit "Peace Army" to the countryside to collect rent, and the farmers suffered deeply. After the land reform, Ye Bandit plotted revenge and, together with his nephew Ye Zhengzhong, personally killed two militiamen and the director of a factory in Jiangyan, and dug out the hearts of the victims and stir-fried them to eat. Li Daozhong, an evil bully in Xuhui District, Shanghai, nicknamed "The Mischief King," organized the Little Axe Gang and the Little Knife Team to exploit the people. In 1948, Li Bandit led more than 30 local ruffians to Chongming Island to rob, killing more than 70 farmers.

　　Among those arrested this time were also heads of reactionary secret societies who had been doing evil for many years. For example, Liu Dequan, a special agent of the "Military Statistics Bureau" and the leader of the Yiguandao altar, was originally a hooligan leader in the Shiliupu area of Shanghai. Later, he was introduced by the "Chief Captain of the Criminal Investigation Brigade" of the bandit "Police Bureau" to work as a plainclothes detective in the tram company, oppressing workers in many ways. In one district alone, more than one hundred people were persecuted by him. After liberation, Liu Bandit went underground, changed the name of the Yiguandao altar to the Guan Gong Association, spread rumors, and continued to do evil. Xu Yiqing, a Yiguandao preacher, extorted huge sums of money and exploited residents when he served as the pseudo-Jiazhang. After liberation, he sent his younger brother to escort special agents to Taiwan and hid guns for the bandits.

　　The arrested counter-revolutionaries were all bitterly hated by the people. Many factories, schools, and neighborhood residents in Shanghai held celebrations for the arrest of the counter-revolutionaries. Shi Xiaomei, a famous textile worker in Shanghai, wrote a letter thanking the People's Government, saying: The People's Government accepted our demands and arrested the counter-revolutionaries, and avenged our grievances. Many factories and schools have held accusation meetings, demanding that the Municipal People's Government severely punish this group of counter-revolutionaries according to law. Gao Shaoshan, the wife of martyr Liang Renda, who was tragically killed by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in the Quanggong Building Massacre, said with great passion: "I demand that the People's Government severely punish these incorrigible special agents and avenge the martyrs!"

　　The day after the arrest of the counter-revolutionaries, the Shanghai Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Suburban Farmers Association, and youth, student, women, cultural and educational, and business circles held a joint meeting of people's organizations in the city to discuss in detail the elimination of counter-revolutionaries in various grassroots organizations in the city, and passed the "Joint Statement of Shanghai People's Organizations." The statement expressed full support for this action of the People's Government and demanded that the People's Government promptly punish them according to law; and called on all grassroots units such as factories, enterprises, companies, organs, schools, street neighborhoods, and townships in the city to quickly organize counter-revolutionary suppression committees to plan, mobilize, organize, and lead the people to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The local organizations in Shanghai of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and other eight democratic parties also issued a joint declaration of the local organizations of the democratic parties in Shanghai on the same day, warmly supporting the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

　　上海继续逮捕一批反革命分子
    全市人民欢呼称快要求严惩特务匪徒
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市人民政府于四月二十七日继续逮捕了一批罪大恶极的反革命分子。上海全市人民为此而欢呼称快。上海市各民主党派和各人民团体分别发表联合声明和宣言，要求予反革命分子以严厉镇压，并号召人民协助政府肃清反革命。
    在被逮捕的反革命分子中，有些是蒋匪武装特务，杀人凶犯。如杀害过无数人民的、混名“四霸天”之一的陆杏生，是匪“江南人民反共突击军四纵队副纵队司令兼第一支队长”。陆匪在一九四二年至一九四四年间，在苏南区武进一带乡间杀死居民近千人，被其霸占为妻妾的妇女有二十余人。江南解放后，陆匪潜逃台湾，此次潜回上海作乱，被我捕获。
    有些是抗拒登记，或登记后仍继续进行反革命活动的特务匪徒。如国民党“军统”特务童襄，曾任“军统”的东南区特派员、浙江站站长。抗日战争期间在衢州、金华、江山一带残害人民，血案很多，曾参加“衢州集中营”的大屠杀，混身沾满人民鲜血。日寇投降后，童匪又依仗“军统”特务势力，霸占商船民房。解放后，童匪毫不悔悟，仍继续进行破坏活动。
    还有一些是潜伏在工厂中进行破坏活动的蒋匪特务。潜伏在上海煤气公司的特务分子章子衡，是特务头子陆京士的重要干部，曾任匪“警察局情报组组长”、“护工大队大队附”。解放前多次开黑名单，领头捕捉爱国工人余长生等多人。他是制造劝工大楼血案（一九四七年二月九日）的主犯之一。解放前夕，他在南京路电话公司内烧毁大批反动文件，企图消灭罪证。解放时，他冒充人民政府工作人员，进行破坏。解放后，又暗中活动，抗不登记。
    还有的反革命分子，是潜伏在学校中进行破坏的。如刘匪伯珩历任国民党上海市第十一区党部执委，解放前包揽诉讼，敲诈勒索，曾指使特务逮捕爱国教育工作者徐金涛、桂德渠、周裕德。解放后，刘匪伪装进步，继续进行反革命活动。
    还有一批是残害人民的恶霸分子。如从苏北区泰县逃匿上海的恶霸地主叶庆义，过去恃强霸占，奸淫妇女，无恶不作。经常带“自卫队”与匪“和平军”下乡收租，农民受害极深。土地改革后，叶匪图谋报复，曾与其侄叶正中亲手杀死两个民兵与姜堰某工厂主任，并将被害者的心挖出炒吃。上海市徐汇区恶霸李道中，绰号“混世魔王”，组织小斧头帮、小刀队鱼肉人民。一九四八年，李匪曾率地痞流氓三十余人至崇明岛抢劫，杀死农民七十多人。
    这次被捕的还有作恶多年的反动会道门头子。如“军统”特务、一贯道坛主刘匪德全，原为上海市十六铺一带流氓头子，后由匪“警察局侦缉总队总队长”介绍到电车公司任便衣侦探，多方压迫工人，仅一个区被其迫害者即有一百余人。解放后，刘匪转入地下，将一贯道坛改称关公会，散布谣言，继续作恶。一贯道点传师徐益卿，任伪甲长时勒索巨款，剥削居民，解放后又派其弟护送特务分子赴台湾，代匪隐藏枪支。
    被逮捕的反革命分子，都是为人民所切齿痛恨的。上海市许多工厂、学校和里弄居民为反革命分子的就逮举行了庆祝会。上海市著名纺织工人施小妹写信感谢人民政府说：人民政府接受我们的要求，逮捕了反革命分子，是替我们伸了冤。很多工厂、学校都召开了控诉会，要求市人民政府依法严惩这批反革命分子。在劝工大楼血案中惨遭蒋匪特务杀害的梁仁达烈士的夫人高绍珊激昂地说：“我要求人民政府严惩这些怙恶不悛的特务分子，为烈士们报仇！”
    在逮捕反革命分子的次日，上海市抗美援朝分会、上海市总工会、上海市郊农民协会以及青年、学生、妇女、文教、工商界等团体举行了全市人民团体联席会议，详细讨论了在全市各基层组织中肃清反革命分子的问题，通过了“上海市人民团体联合声明”。声明中表示全力拥护人民政府这一行动，要求人民政府迅速依法惩办；并号召全市各工厂、企业、公司、机关、学校、街道里弄及乡镇等各基层单位，迅速组织肃清反革命委员会，有计划地发动、组织和领导人民群众镇压反革命。中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会等八个民主党派在上海的地方组织，也于同日发表了各民主党派上海市地方组织的联合宣言，热烈拥护上海市人民政府大张旗鼓地镇压反革命。
