The criticism published in your newspaper on May 9th regarding Tangshan Railway Factory and the Iron Road Ministry Factory Affairs Bureau neglecting the reward aspect of the collective contract is fundamentally factual. We now offer the following self-criticism:

After obtaining approval from the Iron Road Ministry Factory Affairs Bureau, the Tangshan Railway Factory administration and the trade union formally signed a collective contract on December 7, 1950. During the contract's implementation, the Factory Affairs Bureau considered this collective contract a precedent for railway factories within the customs area. Therefore, it instructed the factory to continuously collect data and submit a summary of the trial collective contract work to the bureau before January 25, 1951. On January 24, 1951, the factory reported to the Factory Affairs Bureau the completion of the task figures and requested a bonus of 80,000 salary points but did not attach a work summary of the trial contract. To understand the contract's implementation and use it as a reference for evaluating performance and determining the bonus amount, the Factory Affairs Bureau repeatedly requested it from the factory. The factory finally submitted the summary to the bureau on February 24th, and the Factory Affairs Bureau officially issued the reward order to the factory on April 13th. The delay during this period was mainly due to the absence of a specific reward clause and performance evaluation method in the contract, leading to disputes between the two parties regarding the bonus amount.

Our self-criticism regarding this matter is as follows: Originally, the Factory Affairs Bureau believed that the conditions for signing the contract were not mature. However, at the time, in order to accommodate the workers' sentiments, the Factory Affairs Bureau finally signed this incomplete collective contract. This shows that our understanding of the basic spirit of signing collective contracts was insufficient. Secondly, we lacked experience in collective contracts and did not study them in depth. We overemphasized the consideration of assessment and reward methods and overlooked the fact that once a contract is signed, no matter how incomplete, it should be earnestly fulfilled, instead of endlessly circling around "economic accounting" and "objective conditions." We felt that there were many things in the Factory Affairs Bureau's work that were more important than collective contracts, so that whenever trade union cadres came to the bureau to discuss collective contracts, we could not meet them in a timely manner. All of these are due to our ideological underestimation of the importance of contracts.

In the future, we plan to: (1) Strengthen contact with the trade union. At the monthly joint meetings of directly subordinate factory directors, we will invite trade union comrades to participate, proactively solicit opinions, promptly notify the trade union of the administration's work plans, and solicit their opinions to prevent the phenomenon of each doing their own thing and inconsistent steps. (2) Establish good liaison contracts with relevant departments to overcome biases. In this way, we can gradually become familiar with our own business, and we can also have an appropriate understanding of the main plans and systems of relevant departments, so that we can gain more in mutual contact.

### 铁道部厂务局对不重视集体合同的检讨

　　铁道部厂务局对不重视集体合同的检讨
    五月九日贵报刊登读者批评唐山铁路工厂及铁道部厂务局不重视集体合同的奖励一事，基本上是事实。现在我们检讨如下：
    唐山铁路工厂行政与工会经铁道部厂务局同意后，于一九五○年十二月七日正式签订集体合同，在合同执行期间，厂务局认为这次的集体合同是关内铁路工厂的先例，所以通知该厂随时注意搜集资料，并要他们于一九五一年一月二十五日以前，将试订集体合同的工作总结报局。该厂于一九五一年一月二十四日向厂务局报告完成任务数字，请求发给奖金八万薪分，但未附试订合同工作总结。厂务局为了了解执行合同情况，作为考核成绩决定奖金的参考，经向该厂催索，该厂于二月二十四日始将总结报局，至四月十三日厂务局始正式将奖励命令发往该厂，这期间的延误原因主要是由于合同中未规定一个具体奖励条文以及考核成绩办法，因此双方对于奖金额有争议。
    现在我们对这件事的检讨是：本来厂务局认为签订合同的条件不成熟，但当时为了照顾工人情绪，厂务局终于签订了这个不完整的集体合同，这说明我们对于签订集体合同的基本精神领会不够。其次，我们对集体合同既缺乏经验，又不深入研究，对考核奖励办法等考虑过多，忽略了无论合同怎样不周密，一经签字之后，就该切实地履行，而一味地在“经济核算”、“客观条件”上兜圈子。认为厂务局工作当中，比集体合同还重要的事情多得很，以致历次工会干部来局洽谈集体合同时，不能及时接谈，这些都是由于思想上轻视合同的重要性所致。
    今后我们拟：（一）加强与工会联系，在每月举行直辖厂长联席会议时，请工会同志参加，主动地吸收意见，把行政的工作计划及时通知工会，并征求他们意见，防止各干一套，步调不一致的现象。（二）作好有关部门的联系合同，以克服偏见。这样对自己的业务可以渐渐熟悉，而对有关部门的主要计划、制度等，也可有适当程度的了解，这样在互相联系上才能有更大的收获。
