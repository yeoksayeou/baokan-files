Southwest Region State-Owned Trading Companies Reduce Transport Time
    Southwest Region State-owned Textile, General Merchandise, and Native Produce Companies have actively improved freight operations, reduced cargo costs, and accelerated material exchange.
    In the Southwest Region's material exchanges over the past year or so, freight costs have often accounted for a large proportion of the overall cost. This is because state-owned trading companies in the Southwest Region often transport goods back and forth according to administrative systems and are not good at finding convenient transport routes, resulting in goods being transshipped and stockpiled during transportation. Since March of this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Southwest Military and Political Committee's Financial and Economic Committee and the Ministry of Trade, state-owned trading companies in the Southwest Region have made striving for shorter routes and times in freight transport this year's important task. In response to the inconvenient transportation and insufficient means of transport in the Southwest Region, they have begun to adopt various methods to improve transport efficiency. First, state-owned trading companies in the Southwest Region re-evaluated and studied the old freight routes, and after careful calculation, determined the most cost-effective detour methods. For example, native products transported from Yunnan to Chongqing used to be transshipped via Guiyang, but now it has been decided to transship them via Luxian in southern Sichuan, which can reduce the freight cost per ton of native products by 60 percent compared to the past. Secondly, a direct allocation method is adopted between the starting point of cargo dispatch and the sales location, avoiding the roundabout phenomenon in the transport process. For example, the transport of goods between Shanghai, Wuhan, and the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou used to take Chongqing as a transshipment hub, but now it has been changed to be transported through Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces, no longer detouring through Chongqing. This not only improves the speed of freight transport but also reduces the cost of each ton of goods by about 2 million yuan compared to the past. In addition, state-owned trading companies in the Southwest Region also systematically allocate transport tools in freight transport to prevent the occurrence of empty return trips by various transport tools. The method of coordinating various means of transport for round-trip transport has also begun to be adopted in some areas. Guizhou Province connects packhorse relay transport with highway transport, enabling material exchanges to penetrate many remote areas of the province.
    After improving freight operations using various methods, the cost of various goods of state-owned trading companies in the Southwest Region has been significantly reduced. For example, the Southwest Region Textile Company has saved more than 5 billion yuan in freight costs for transporting large quantities of cotton cloth from southern Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou compared to the past. Many native products that were previously unsalable due to high costs have now opened up sales in other regions due to reduced costs.

            State-owned Trading Companies and Cooperatives in Hebei Corrected the Shortcomings of "Commodity Travel"
    State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Hebei Province have adopted the method of transporting goods directly from the dispatching point to the sales point in their cargo allocation work, thereby reducing the cost of goods and enabling goods to reach consumers in a timely manner.
    In the past, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Hebei Province increased the cost of goods and delayed the time for selling goods because they mechanically allocated goods according to the upper and lower administrative systems. Many grassroots cooperatives even lost money due to "commodity travel."
    In order to implement direct transport, state-owned trading companies in Hebei Province first strengthened their transport work agencies. For example, the Hebei Province Department Store has set up a cargo allocation group in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, and the branch companies in the province have made sales plans for the next quarter in advance; the allocation group transports goods directly from other regions to the branch companies according to the plan.
    Co-operatives at all levels in Hebei Province have also set up material purchasing and supply stations in traffic arteries and material distribution centers. Under the unified dispatch of the prefectural or county cooperatives, goods for export are transported from the grassroots cooperatives to the supply stations, and then directly transported from the supply stations to the sales locations. The goods supplied to the members are also allocated from the place of departure to the purchasing and supply stations near the cooperatives that need these goods, and directly allocated to the cooperatives that need the goods.
    After the implementation of direct transportation, the business operations of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Hebei Province have become more planned. They paid special attention to shortening the distance of goods entering and leaving warehouses and transshipment. For example, in order to transport grain from Northeast China to Xianshuigu in Hebei Province, the Yangliuqing Branch of Hebei Province Grain Company used to transport the grain from the train to Duliu Town near Tianjin, and then from the train to Xianshuigu. Now, it is changed to transport by train to Lutai, and then by boat to Xianshuigu, which can reduce the journey by more than 100 miles and reduce the cost per kilogram of grain by more than 21 yuan compared to the past. Cangxian Prefecture Cooperative purchased 500 iron pots from Yangquan, more than 1,000 barrels of kerosene from Tianjin, and 20,000 kilograms of bamboo seedlings from Wuxi, all of which were transported directly from the production area to the sales area, saving a lot of freight; among them, the freight for goods allocated to Huanghua County alone saved 330,000 yuan compared to the past.

### 改进货运工作，加速物资交流！

　　改进货运工作，加速物资交流！
    西南区国营各贸易公司运货做到路线近时间短
    西南区国营花纱布公司、百货公司和土产公司由于积极改进货运工作，减低了货物的成本，加速了物资交流。
    西南区一年多以来的物资交流中，货物的运输费用在成本中常占很大比重。原因是西南区各个国营贸易公司调拨货物时，经常按行政系统往返运输，不善于寻找便捷的运输路线，使得货物在运输过程中辗转积压。今年三月以来，西南区各个国营贸易公司根据西南区军政委员会财政经济委员会和贸易部的指示，都以争取在货运中做到路线近、时间短为各该公司今年的重要工作任务，并针对西南区交通不便和运输工具不足的情况，开始采取各种提高运输效能的办法。首先，西南区各个国营贸易公司重新比较、研究了旧有的货运路线，经过精打细算，确定了最省费的改道办法。例如由云南运重庆的土产，过去都经贵阳转运，现在决定改由四川南部的泸县转运，可使每吨土产运费比过去减少百分之六十。其次，在货物起拨点和销售地之间，采取直线调拨的方法，避免了运输途程中的迂回现象。如上海、武汉与云南、贵州两省间的货物调运，过去都以重庆为转运枢纽，现在都改为经过湖南、广西等省运送，不再绕道重庆，这样不但提高了货运速度，且使每吨货物的成本比过去降低了二百万元左右。此外，西南区各个国营贸易公司又在货运中有计划地调配运输工具，防止各种运输工具在货运中发生回空现象。把各种交通工具配合起来来回接运的办法，也已在部分地区开始采用。贵州省把驮马驿运和公路运输衔接起来，使得物资交流深入到了该省许多偏僻地区。
    用各种办法改进货运工作以后，西南区各个国营贸易公司的各种货物成本都已显著减低。如西南区花纱布公司调运川南、云南、贵州三地大批棉布的运费，已比过去节省了五十多亿元。以前因为成本太高而滞销的许多土产，现在由于成本减低，在外区打开了销路。

            河北各国营贸易公司和合作社纠正了“商品旅行”的缺点
    河北省各国营贸易公司和合作社在货物调拨工作中采用了把货物从起拨点直接运输到销货地点的办法，因而减低了商品成本，并使商品及时地到达消费者手中。
    河北省各地国营贸易公司和合作社过去因为机械地按上、下级行政系统调拨货物，增高了商品的成本，耽误了销售商品的时间。不少基层合作社更因“商品旅行”赔了钱。
    河北省各国营贸易公司为了实行直线运输，首先加强了运输工作机构。如河北省百货公司在上海、天津等大城市专设了调拨货物小组，省内各分、支公司又预先作出下一季度销货计划；调拨小组就根据计划从外区直接运货到各分、支公司。
    河北省各级合作社也在交通要道和物资集散地设立了物资采购供应站。在专区社或县社统一调度下，外销货物都由基层社运到供应站，再由供应站直接运到销货地点。供给社员的货物，也由起运点拨运到需要这些货物的合作社附近的采购供应站，直接拨给要货的合作社。
    实行直线运输后，河北省各地国营贸易公司和合作社的业务经营也更有计划了。他们特别注意了缩短货物出入仓库和转拨运输的距离。例如河北省粮食公司杨柳青支公司为了从东北运粮到河北省咸水沽，过去须将粮食由火车运到天津附近的独流镇，再由火车运到咸水沽，现在改由火车运到芦台，再由船只运到碱水沽，这样就可以少走一百多里路，并使每斤粮食成本比过去减少二十一元以上。沧县专区合作社从阳泉购办五百口铁锅，从天津购办一千多桶煤油，从无锡购办两万斤竹苗子，都是从产地直运销地，省了不少运费；其中仅拨给黄骅县货物的运费就比过去节省了三十三万元。
