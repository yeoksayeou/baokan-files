    I. Henan Huangchuan Peasants Eliminate Production Worries
    Editor:
    After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Huangchuan County, Henan Province, the peasants have eliminated their production worries and their production enthusiasm has greatly increased. Many peasants said, "In the past, although we were given land, we didn't dare to produce with peace of mind because of the counter-revolutionaries. Now that the government has suppressed the counter-revolutionaries, we must produce well."
    Xuezi District peasant Xing Youchang's land was seized by the local tyrant landlord Li Shutang last fall. Xing Youchang wanted to report this to the government, but he was afraid that the government would be "lenient" towards Li Shutang and that he would be retaliated against, so he dared not say a word. But he was always listless and unmotivated to produce. This year, the government executed Li Shutang, and Xing Youchang was extremely excited. He said, "Before, I was always afraid that the land I was given was not secure, but now I am not afraid of anything and I must produce well." After the township executed the local tyrant Li Wenyan, that same evening, peasants Liu Kefu, Wang Shaozhou, Xue Mingrong, and Sun Wenxian drank some wine together to celebrate their complete liberation and expressed their determination to produce well in the future.
    Now, a high tide of spring plowing production is in full swing throughout the county. Many peasants get up before dawn to hoe wheat, cut rice seedlings, and dig field ridges. They say, "Now that the bandits have been eliminated, we are not afraid of losing our livestock and farm tools if we leave them outside." The women say, "After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we women dare to go outside at night to braid our hair."

    II. Hebei Daxing's 20,000 River Workers Intensify River Repair
    Editor:
    After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Daxing County, Hebei Province, the broad masses of the people were overjoyed and unanimously used practical actions such as intensifying production and working hard to celebrate the great victory of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
    The 20,000 laborers who were repairing the Yongding River held a celebration meeting on the night the government arrested a group of counter-revolutionaries, and launched heated discussions and accusations at the squadron level, unanimously proposing to use the practical action of strengthening river repair to celebrate their victory. After the meeting, the units launched patriotic labor competitions. The villagers of Gaodian in the Fourth District originally carried an average of three cubic meters of soil per person per day, but now they have increased to an average of six cubic meters of soil per person per day. Liu Dekui used to be unwilling to work hard, carrying only two flat baskets of soil at a time; after the government arrested the counter-revolutionaries, he carried four baskets of soil at a time and said happily, "The grievances of many years have been avenged today, and people are refreshed by happy events; I don't feel tired even working like this today." The laborers in Libao Village, who had lower work efficiency in the past, were happy to participate in the competition when they heard that the local tyrant landlords Zhang Lianke and Zhang Baoshu in their village had been arrested by the government; they originally could only carry an average of two and a half cubic meters of soil per person per day, but now they have increased to an average of four cubic meters of soil. Wang Dehai said, "Now that the knife that has been in my heart for many years has been pulled out, I have the strength to work."

### 大举镇压反革命  农民生产情绪高

　　大举镇压反革命
    农民生产情绪高
            一、河南潢川农民消除了生产顾虑编辑同志：
    河南省潢川县镇压反革命后，农民消除了生产顾虑，生产情绪大大提高。很多农民说：“过去我们虽然分到了土地，但有反革命分子在，我们还不敢放心生产。现在政府镇压了反革命分子，我们可要好好生产了。”
    踅子区农民邢有昌分得的土地，在去年秋天被恶霸地主李树棠占去了。邢有昌想向政府报告，但又怕政府“宽大”了李树棠，自己会受到报复，就不敢啃声。但他老是没精打采，生产不起劲。今年政府处决了李树棠，邢有昌兴奋极了，他说：“以前我老是怕自己分得的地不牢稳，现在我啥也不怕了，一定得好好生产。”该乡枪毙了恶霸李文彦后，当天晚上，农民刘可福、王绍州、薛明荣、孙文献四人一块喝了些酒，庆祝自己的澈底翻身，并且表示今后要好好生产的决心。
    现在，全县正热烈展开春耕生产的高潮。不少农民天不亮就起来锄麦、打秧草、挖田埂子。他们说：“土匪肃清了，牲口、农具放在外边也不怕丢了。”妇女们说：“镇压反革命后，俺们妇女晚上也敢在外边掏帽辫了。”

            二、河北大兴两万河工加紧修河编辑同志：
    河北省大兴县镇压反革命后，全县广大人民兴高采烈，一致用加紧生产、努力工作等实际行动，庆祝镇压反革命的伟大胜利。
    正在永定河上修河的两万民工，在政府逮捕一批反革命分子的那天晚上，举行了庆祝大会，并以中队为单位展开了热烈讨论和控诉，一致提出用加强修河的实际行动，来庆祝自己的胜利。会后，各单位展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛。四区高店村民工原来每人每天平均担三方土，现已提高到每人每天平均担六方土。刘德奎过去不肯卖力气，一趟只挑两平筐土；政府逮捕反革命分子以后，他一趟挑四筐土，并高兴地说：“多年的冤仇今天报了，人得喜事精神爽；今天这么干也不觉得累。”过去工作效率较低的李堡村民工，听说他们村的恶霸地主张连科和张保树已被政府逮捕了，就高兴地参加了竞赛运动；他们原来每人每天平均只能担两方半土，现已提高到平均担四方土。王德海说：“把多年在心上的刀子拔掉了，劲就上来了。”
