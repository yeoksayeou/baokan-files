　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 23rd (TASS): The European Workers' Committee Against German Remilitarization has issued a declaration supporting the West German people's movement against remilitarization and demanding a peace treaty with Germany be concluded in 1951 through a people's vote.

　　The declaration points out: The Western occupying powers and the Bonn puppet government have no right to decide on the issue of German remilitarization. This issue must be subject to the opinion of the German people. The Adenauer government wants to prevent the holding of a people's vote, which is to deprive the West German people of their right to decide their own destiny.

　　The declaration states: "German working men and women, you are not alone in conducting a vote against German remilitarization. The working people of Europe, who have confidence in you, are with you in a spirit of fraternal solidarity and militant cooperation. Do not betray this trust."

　　The declaration calls on the working people of West Germany to redouble their efforts to hold people's votes in trade unions and enterprises, to oppose the consequences of remilitarization, to oppose the lowering of living standards and strive for higher wages, and to stop the manufacture and transportation of war materials.

　　The declaration also calls on trade union members in Europe to express their solidarity with the German working people's plebiscite, and to demand that their trade unions conclude international, militant trade union agreements against imperialist war preparations and to strive for the improvement of the living conditions of the working people, and to strengthen the work of collecting signatures for the Five-Power Peace Pact declaration.

　　欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会
    发表宣言支持西德人民投票运动
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十三日讯：欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会发表宣言，支持西德人民反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结对德和约的人民投票运动。
    宣言指出：西方占领国家和波恩傀儡政府无权决定使德国重新军国主义化的问题。这个问题必须征求德国人民的意见。阿登纳政府想要阻止举行人民投票，这就是要剥夺西德人民决定自己命运的权利。
    宣言中说：“德国的男女工人们，你们在进行反对德国重新军国主义化的投票中，并不是孤单的。对你们具有信心的欧洲劳动人民，是以兄弟般的团结精神和战斗的合作精神与你们在一起的。你们不要辜负了这样的信心。”
    宣言号召西德的劳动人民，加倍努力，在工会和企业里举行人民投票，反对重新军国主义化的后果，反对生活水准的降低和争取提高工资，阻止制造和运输战争物资。
    宣言并且号召欧洲的工会会员们，对德国的劳动人民举行人民投票表示声援，并要求自己的工会，缔结反对帝国主义战争准备，争取改善劳动人民生活状况的、国际性的、战斗的工会协定，并加强为五大国缔结和平公约宣言征集签名的工作。
