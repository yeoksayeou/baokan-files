　　In Memory of Our Dear Friend Agnes Smedley
       Mao Dun
    Today marks the first anniversary of the death of American progressive writer and journalist Agnes Smedley. We are holding a solemn memorial service here to express our sincere respect and mourning for Ms. Smedley.
    Ms. Smedley was a loyal friend of the Chinese people. In Ms. Smedley's decades of struggle, a large and major part was inseparable from the liberation movement of our Chinese people. She spent a total of twelve years in China, off and on. These twelve years were precisely the most difficult stage of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. Ms. Smedley first came to China in 1928, and her first book about China, "Chinese Destinies," was published in 1933. This book can be said to be a history of the blood and tears of Chinese peasants. Her second book about China, published in 1934, was entitled "China's Red Army Marches." This book was the first to tell the world the truth about the Chinese Communist Party and its armed forces—the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—and exposed all the shameless rumors of the imperialist reactionary group slandering the Chinese people's liberation movement. Her third and fourth books about China were entitled "China Fights Back" and "China's Battle Songs." Both of these books were published during the War of Resistance against Japan, and powerfully pointed out to the world that it was the Chinese Communist Party, not the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, that led the Chinese people in adhering to the War of Resistance against Japan. Ms. Smedley's last book about China was "The Great Road: The Life and Times of Chu Teh." When she wrote this book, she was already in poverty and illness, and was increasingly persecuted by the American reactionaries. Disease, poverty, and persecution prevented her from completing this book.
    Ms. Smedley not only served the interests of the Chinese people with her literary talent, but also, as a social activist, assisted the great cause of Chinese people's liberation in various ways in China and the United States.
    In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, she traveled around appealing for donations, purchasing medicines, and sending them to the Eighth Route Army to treat wounded soldiers. She joined the Chinese Red Cross Field Rescue Team and worked with the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, sharing life and death, for twenty-two months. Many British and American people were moved by her enthusiastic and courageous actions and her truthful and vivid reports on the Chinese revolution, and only then began to abandon their prejudices and humbly seek to understand the great power of the Chinese people's revolution and the source of this power. She won many international friends for the Chinese people.
    After 1947, the inevitable victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the inevitable failure of the American imperialists and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, became a foregone conclusion. In order to carry out a desperate struggle, the American imperialists frantically prepared for a new war of aggression, and American politics became increasingly fascist. Just actions and calls for opposing war and defending peace would bring unexpected disasters in the United States, and progressive Americans were often persecuted. Ms. Smedley was certainly not immune. By February 1949, this despicable persecution reached its climax. Warmonger MacArthur personally came forward to slander Ms. Smedley as a "Soviet spy." However, this despicable trick of spewing blood aroused public outrage, and the reactionary American government did not dare to attack Ms. Smedley rashly. They used all kinds of despicable means to force Ms. Smedley to have nowhere to go in the United States. Wherever Ms. Smedley went, American agents would follow her. Anyone who had contact with Ms. Smedley would be interrogated by American agents like interrogating a criminal, getting entangled endlessly. At the same time, the reactionary American government did not allow Ms. Smedley to leave the United States. Ms. Smedley had long wanted to come to China, which she loved, but this was of course not allowed. Thinking of other countries, she was also unreasonably rejected by the American government. Finally, she was only allowed to go to the British mainland, which means that although Ms. Smedley could go to England, she could not go anywhere else from England. In November 1949, Ms. Smedley arrived in England, already impoverished and ill. Therefore, her death, although seemingly due to years of struggle life damaging her health, was actually due to various persecutions. The American reactionary government used such means to kill a fighter for peace and people's justice, the most outstanding daughter of the American people.
    Last June, American imperialism brazenly disregarded everything and launched a war of aggression against Korea and Taiwan, seriously threatening Asian and world peace. Thanks to the heroic resistance of the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteers, which wiped out more than 70,000 American invading troops, the American imperialists' plan to expand the war was temporarily shattered. But the American imperialists are still unwilling to accept the lessons of failure. Instead, they are jumping over the wall in desperation, stepping up the exploitation of the American people's blood and sweat, desperately expanding their armed forces, and trying to use a separate peace treaty with Japan to rearm Japan and drive the Japanese people to act as cannon fodder for American imperialism's aggression. In Europe, American imperialism is bent on arming West Germany and has rejected all the positive proposals made by the Soviet Union for defending world peace. The Truman government and its masters, the Wall Street warmongers, are the chief culprits who are plotting to launch a new war of aggression and undermine world peace! They not only endanger the people of the world, but also endanger the American people. They are not only the murderers who persecuted Ms. Smedley, but also the enemies of all kind-hearted peace-loving people! Although Ms. Smedley is dead, the people of the world and the United States are inheriting the just path followed by Ms. Smedley throughout her life, rising up more heroically and in a more organized way to oppose the American imperialists' criminal attempts to conquer the world and slaughter the people. The Chinese people stand on the forefront of opposing American imperialist aggression and defending world peace, and we will commemorate Ms. Smedley with more resolute actions. The strength of the world's peace and democracy camp is now incomparably strong, and the international aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism has already shown signs of disintegration in the face of the people's power; as long as we continue to work hard, the final failure of the warmongers is inevitable.
    Ms. Smedley has unfortunately died, but we will eternally commemorate such a friend of China and a fighter for peace and justice. The kind and peace-loving people of the world will also eternally commemorate her. The final victory belongs to Ms. Smedley and all those who are fighting against American imperialist aggression and defending world peace!

　　悼念我们亲爱的朋友史沫特莱
       茅盾
    今天是美国进步作家和记者史沫特莱女士逝世的一周年。我们在这里召开隆重的追悼会，表示我们对于史沫特莱女士的诚挚的敬意和哀悼。
    史沫特莱女士是中国人民忠实的友人。在史沫特莱数十年的斗争的历史中间，很大的而且是主要的一部分，是和我们中国人民的解放运动分不开的。前前后后，她曾经在中国十二年。这十二个年头，正是中国革命斗争最艰苦的阶段。史沫特莱第一次来中国，是一九二八年，她的关于中国的第一部著作《中国人的命运》出版于一九三三年，这本书可以说是中国农民的血泪史。她的第二部关于中国的著作，出版于一九三四年，名为《中国红军在前进》。这本书第一次把中国共产党及其武装部队——工农红军的真相告诉了全世界，揭破了帝国主义反动集团诬蔑中国人民解放运动的一切无耻的造谣。她的第三、第四部关于中国的著作，名为《中国反攻了》和《中国之战歌》。这两本书都出版于抗战时期，有力地向全世界指出：领导中国人民坚持抗日战争的，不是蒋介石匪帮，而是中国共产党。史沫特莱关于中国的最后的一部著作是《朱德传》。她写这本书的时候，已经是在贫病交迫之中，而且越来越厉害地受到美国反动派的迫害。疾病、贫穷和迫害，使她的这部著作没有完成。
    史沫特莱女士，不但以她的文学天才为中国人民的利益而服务，她同时又以社会活动家的身份，在中国和在美国用各种方式，援助中国人民解放的伟大事业。
    在中国抗战初期，她奔走呼号，募集捐款，购买药品，送到八路军，医治伤兵。她参加了中国红十字会战地救护队，和八路军的战士们一同出生入死，工作了二十二个月。不少的英美人士为她的这种热情勇敢的行动，和她的关于中国革命的真实而生动的报道所感动，这才开始抛弃成见，虚心企求了解中国人民革命的伟大力量以及这种力量的根源。她为中国人民争取了不少的国际朋友。
    一九四七年后，中国人民革命的必然胜利，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮之必然失败，已成定局。为了进行绝望的挣扎，美帝国主义疯狂地准备新的侵略战争，美国政治亦日益法西斯化。反对战争，保卫和平的正义行动和呼声，在美国是会招来不测之祸的，进步的美国人士时时遭到迫害。史沫特莱当然不能幸免。到了一九四九年二月，这种卑劣的迫害行为达到了顶点。战争贩子麦克阿瑟亲自出马，诬陷史沫特莱为“苏联间谍”。但是这一种血口喷人的卑劣的伎俩，激起了人民的公愤，反动的美国政府不敢对史沫特莱遽下毒手。他们用了各种卑鄙的手段，逼得史沫特莱在美国无路可走。不论史沫特莱到那里，美国特务就钉到那里。不论何人，只要和史沫特莱有了接触，美国特务就会像审讯犯人似地盘问那人，纠缠不清。同时美国的反动政府却又不许史沫特莱离开美国。史沫特莱早就想到她所热爱的中国来，这当然不能得到许可。想到其他国家，也被美国政府无理地拒绝了。最后只允许她到英国本土，这就是说，史沫特莱虽然可到英国，却不能从英国到其他任何地方。一九四九年十一月，史沫特莱到了英国，已经是贫病交加。所以她的死，表面上虽然是由于多年的斗争生活损害了她的健康，实际上却是由于种种的迫害。美国反动政府就用这样的手段杀害了和平人民正义的战士，美国人民的最优秀的女儿。
    去年六月，美帝国主义悍然不顾一切，发动了侵略朝鲜和台湾的战争，亚洲和世界和平受到严重的威胁。由于朝鲜人民军和我国志愿军的英勇抵抗，消灭了美国侵略军七万余人，美帝国主义的扩大战争的计划暂时被粉碎。但是美帝国主义还不肯接受失败的教训，反而狗急跳墙，加紧榨取美国人民血汗，拚命扩充武装力量，并且想用单独对日媾和，从新武装日本的方式，驱使日本人民充当美帝国主义侵略的炮灰。在欧洲方面，美帝国主义一意武装西德，拒绝了苏联对于保卫世界和平的一切积极性的建议。杜鲁门政府及其主人华尔街的战争贩子们是阴谋发动新的侵略战争、破坏世界和平的首恶元凶！他们不但危害着全世界人民，也危害着美国人民。他们不但是迫害史沫特莱的凶手，也是一切善良的和平人民的敌人！史沫特莱虽然死了，全世界以及美国的人民正在继承史沫特莱一生所遵循的正义的道路，更英勇、更有组织地起来，反对美帝国主义的征服世界屠杀人民的罪恶企图。中国人民站在反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的最前线，我们将以更坚决的行动来纪念史沫特莱。世界和平民主阵营的力量，现在是无比地强大了，以美帝国主义为首的国际侵略集团在人民力量的面前，已经显露出分崩离析的裂痕；只要我们继续努力，战争贩子们的最后失败是必然的事。
    史沫特莱是不幸死了，对于这样一位中国之友，和平正义的战士，我们是永恒纪念着的。全世界的善良和平的人民也是永恒纪念着的。最后的胜利属于史沫特莱以及一切为反对美国帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平而奋斗的人们！
