　　Statement on the Japanese Question
    The following is the "Statement on the Japanese Question" issued by the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students at its meeting in Beijing:
    The Executive Committee members of the International Union of Students held a meeting in Beijing from April 26 to 30, 1951. Executive Committee members and student representatives from Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, the People's Republic of China, Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Ecuador, the German Democratic Republic, the Netherlands, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Malaya, Mongolia, West Africa, the Philippines, Reunion, Romania, Thailand, Republican Spain, Syria, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam listened with great concern to the report on the Japanese student movement and the telegram from the National Federation of Japanese Student Self-Government Associations, a member organization of the International Union of Students. From this, we learned that Japanese students are waging a firm struggle against the worsening of their situation, against unemployment, suffering, and hunger, and against the persecution of students and professors.
    From the reports we received, it is clear that this situation is the result of Japan's failure to achieve freedom and independence. On the contrary, Japan is being remilitarized. Students are forced to wander the streets, and schools have become barracks for an increasing number of police and armed military police. Progressive teachers and professors are being driven out of schools and universities, while large numbers of major war criminals who used scientific institutions to carry out barbaric atrocities are being released and re-employed. Military airports, naval bases, and arsenals are being restored or built in large numbers, and ground, naval, and air forces are also being established.
    The youth and students of Japan will be the first to suffer from the harm of rearmament and will once again be forced to serve as cannon fodder for aggressive wars. Japanese students and people who strive for peace are subjected to unwarranted and brutal persecution.
    This situation is a direct consequence of the U.S. occupying authorities pursuing a policy of hegemony in violation of the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements.
    The representatives of the student organizations participating in this meeting paid close attention to the U.S. government's actions to rearm Japan and conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. A separate peace treaty is one without the participation of the Soviet Union and China, the countries that suffered the most from Japanese aggression, and which played an important role in defeating Japanese imperialism. This action by the U.S. government has turned Japan into a base of aggression and a base for launching new wars in Asia. This threatens the peaceful lives of students and people in Asia and the world.
    The reports heard at the meeting indicate that many countries, especially Asian student organizations, are actively fighting alongside Japanese students against the rearmament of Japan and the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan.
    The people and students of the world, especially in Asia, have vivid memories of the countless atrocities committed by Japanese imperialists in the past. They paid an immeasurable price in the war against Japanese imperialism. Peace-loving people and students will never allow Japan to be rearmed, nor will they allow Japanese imperialist aggression to be repeated or for bloody massacres to occur again.
    Opposing the rearmament of Japan and striving for a comprehensive

　　关于日本问题的声明
    【新华社讯】在北京举行的国际学生联合会执行委员会会议发表的《关于日本问题的声明》如下：
    国际学生联合会执行委员会委员于一九五一年四月二十六日至三十日在北京举行会议，执行委员和来自澳大利亚、巴西、保加利亚、缅甸、中华人民共和国、锡兰、捷克斯洛伐克、古巴、厄瓜多尔、德意志民主共和国、荷兰、匈牙利、印度、印尼、伊朗、意大利、日本、朝鲜、黎巴嫩、马来亚、蒙古、西非洲，菲律宾、留尼汪、罗马尼亚、泰国、共和西班牙、叙利亚、苏联和越南的学生代表，都以极大的关心听取了关于日本学生运动的报告和国际学联的会员组织日本学生自治会联合会的来电。从这里，我们知道了日本学生正在进行着坚定不移的斗争，反对使他们的境遇一天天恶化，反对失业、痛苦与饥饿，反对迫害学生和教授。
    从我们收到的报告中可以明显地看出，这种情形是未能实现自由独立的日本的结果。而相反的，日本倒是被重新军事化起来了。学生被迫流浪街头，学校变成了人数与日俱增的警察与武装宪兵的营房。进步的教员和教授被赶出学校和大学，而曾经利用科学机关进行野蛮的暴行的大战犯都大批地被释放而且重新被任用。军用机场、海军基地和兵工厂在大量恢复或兴建，海陆空军也在建立。
    日本的青年与学生将首先受到重新武装的危害，并再一次被迫为侵略战争充当炮灰。凡是为争取和平而奋斗的日本学生与人民都遭到无理的残暴的迫害。
    这种情形是美国占领当局违反波茨坦公告和其他国际协定实行独霸政策的直接后果。
    参加这次会议的学生组织的代表极为注意美国政府重新武装日本与缔结单独对日和约的行动。而单独对日和约是没有苏联和受日本侵略之害最深的中国参加的，这两个国家对于击败日本帝国主义起了重要作用。美国政府的这种行动已使日本变为亚洲的侵略基地和发动新战争的基地。这就威胁了亚洲与世界学生和人民的和平生活。
    会议听取的各项报告说明许多国家，特别是亚洲的学生组织都在积极地与日本学生共同为反对重新武装日本与缔结单独对日和约而斗争。
    对于日本帝国主义者过去所犯的无数暴行，全世界特别是亚洲的人民和学生记忆犹新。他们在抵抗日本帝国主义的战争里付出了无可计量的代价。爱好和平的人民和学生决不容许重新武装日本，不容许日本帝国主义侵略重演或再发生流血的屠杀。
    反对重新武装日本，争取全面对日和约，这是全世界人民与学生也是日本人民与学生的一致要求。世界各地的学生将与日本学生携手共同为和平、民族独立和民主教育而斗争。
    国际学联执委会表示拥护世界和平理事会的各项决议，并号召各国的学生加紧反对重新武装日本与争取缔结一个全面对日和约的斗争。我们坚信正义在我们这边，因此胜利也将是我们的。不管那些违反世界人民的意志的家伙怎样玩弄阴谋诡计，他们不可避免地要归于失败。一个民主独立的日本一定会建立起来。持久的世界和平与青年学生的美好前途毫无问题一定能够实现。
