　　Supporting the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's Remarks Denouncing the UN Illegal Resolution
　　[This newspaper report] The spokespersons of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China Zhi Gong Party, and the Jiusan Society issued separate statements, denouncing the United States for manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass the embargo proposal against China and North Korea, and resolutely supporting the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's remarks.
　　The statement of the spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated in brief: In order to expand its war of aggression, the American aggressors, at the expense of undermining the UN Charter, have once again illegally and shamelessly passed the so-called resolution to impose an embargo on our country and North Korea. Our Foreign Ministry spokesperson has pointed out that "This is another illegal action by the United Nations General Assembly, following the shameful proposal to slander our country as an aggressor, which violates the UN Charter, encroaches on the powers of the Security Council, and deliberately expands the war of aggression." The statement of our Foreign Ministry spokesperson represents our opinion and also reflects the views of the masses of our people on this illegal and shameful proposal. The spokesperson continued: Everyone knows that as early as two years ago, in order to occupy Taiwan, the American aggressors had already implemented the so-called embargo against our country. And the British government had also taken a series of unfriendly actions against our country in trade. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States has been suffering heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean People's troops on the Korean battlefield. In the past month alone, we have achieved a brilliant victory of annihilating 46,000 enemies. This is a manifestation of the great strength of the Chinese and Korean people. In light of the so-called embargo of the imperialist bloc, it will not only cause us no harm, but will further inspire our spirit of shared hatred against the enemy. The spokesperson concluded: The Chinese people have long had the confidence to defeat the American aggressors thoroughly as an answer. Those docile American followers will inevitably suffer the serious consequences of being hostile to the Chinese and Korean people and undermining the United Nations.
　　The statement of the spokesperson of the China Democratic National Construction Association pointed out: This proposal by the United States not only shows its ambition to continue to be hostile to the Chinese and Korean people and prepare to expand the war, but is also a conspiracy by the American financial groups to take this opportunity to disrupt the international market, monopolize military raw materials, and control the economic lifelines of its satellite countries. Therefore, this resolution will inevitably arouse contradictions within the aggressive robbers. The spokesperson said: This illegal resolution of the United Nations under the manipulation of US imperialism has aroused the unparalleled anger of the people of the world and China and North Korea. Our Foreign Ministry spokesperson has issued a solemn warning. All members of our China Democratic National Construction Association and the industrialists and businessmen of the country pledge to unite closely under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, work hard to develop production, promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and strive for self-sufficiency, in order to smash the embargo plot of US imperialism.
　　The written statement of the spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party stated in brief: The passage of this reactionary illegal proposal is another crime of the United Nations General Assembly following the shameful proposal to slander our country as an aggressor. It not only shows that the United Nations General Assembly has become a tool of US imperialism, but also exposes the despicable and shameless conspiracy of the American imperialists to be determined to be enemies of the Chinese and Korean people and deliberately expand the aggression; on the other hand, it also reflects that American imperialism, due to its failure in the war of aggression against Korea, attempts to use this shameful resolution to save itself. However, justice is on the side of the Chinese and Korean people. Our two peoples are absolutely not afraid of any such intimidation by the imperialists. We resolutely oppose this despicable and shameless resolution and express our unparalleled anger. At the same time, our people must, together with the Korean people, continue to give the aggressors a heavier blow on the Korean battlefield, accelerate the liberation of the entire Korea, and strive for lasting peace in the world.
　　The written statement of the spokesperson of the Jiusan Society pointed out: The purpose of US imperialism in submitting this shameless proposal to the United Nations is to indefinitely obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and to increasingly expand the aggression against the People's Republic of China. The United Nations' illegal passage of this criminal proposal once again proves that it is no longer a world organization of the people of all countries, but is increasingly becoming a war tool of the bloodthirsty millionaires of the United States. The spokesperson said: All peace-loving people should further unite, step up the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, strengthen and expand the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and smash all aggressive conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers!

　　民革、民建、致公党和九三学社发言人发表谈话
    拥护外交部发言人斥联大非法决议的谈话
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会中央、民主建国会、中国致公党和九三学社的发言人分别发表谈话，痛斥美国操纵联合国大会非法通过对中朝禁运案，坚决拥护外交部发言人的谈话。
    中国国民党革命委员会中央发言人的谈话略称：美国侵略者为着扩大侵略战争，不惜破坏联合国宪章，竟又非法而无耻地通过所谓对我国和朝鲜实行禁运的决议。我外交部发言人已经指出“这是联合国大会继非法通过诬蔑我国为侵略者的可耻提案后又一破坏联合国宪章，侵越安全理事会权限并蓄意扩大侵略战争的非法行动。”我外交部发言人的谈话，正是代表了我们的意见，也正反映了我国人民大众对这非法而可耻的提案的看法。发言人继称：谁都知道：还在两年以前美国侵略者为着霸占台湾，早就实施所谓对于我国的禁运了。而英国政府也早经在贸易上对我国采取了一系列不友好的行动。以美国为首的帝国主义集团在侵略朝鲜的战场上一直遭受着中朝人民部队沉重的打击，最近一个月内我们还获得歼敌四万六千的辉煌战果。这是中朝人民伟大力量的表现。联系帝国主义集团所谓禁运来看，不但于我们无所损伤，反更激励了我们的同仇敌忾的士气。发言人最后称：中国人民早具信心，必以彻底打败美国侵略者作为回答。那班驯顺的美国追随者必将自食敌视中朝人民和破坏联合国的严重后果。
    民主建国会发言人的谈话中指出：美国的这一提案，不但表明了它对中朝人民继续为敌并准备扩大战争的野心，而且是美国的财阀们企图借此破坏国际市场，独占军火原料以控制仆从国家的经济命脉的阴谋诡计。因此，这个决议还必然会引起侵略强盗们内部的矛盾。发言人称：联合国在美帝国主义操纵下的这一非法决议，已引起全世界及中朝人民的无比愤怒，我外交部发言人已予以严正的警告。我们民主建国会全体会员与全国工商业者誓在中国共产党及毛主席领导下，紧密团结，努力发展生产，促进城乡物资交流，力求自给自足，以粉碎美帝国主义的禁运诡计。
    中国致公党发言人的书面谈话略称：这项反动的非法提案之获得通过，是联合国大会继非法通过诬蔑我国为侵略者的可耻提案后的又一罪行。它不仅说明了联合国大会已成为美帝国主义的御用机关，同时也暴露了美国帝国主义者决心与中朝人民为敌、蓄意扩大侵略的卑鄙无耻阴谋；另一方面也反映了美国帝国主义因在侵朝战争中的失败，妄图利用这种可耻的决议来加以挽救。可是，正义是在中朝人民的一边。我们两国人民，绝对不怕帝国主义者任何这一类的恐吓行为。我们坚决反对这种卑鄙无耻的决议，并表示无比的愤怒，同时我们的人民一定和朝鲜人民一起，继续在朝鲜战场上予侵略者以更沉重的打击。加速全朝鲜的解放，并争取全世界的持久和平。
    九三学社发言人的书面谈话指出：美帝国主义向联合国提出这个无耻提案，其目的在于无限期地阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，以及日益扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略。联合国非法通过这个罪恶提案，又一次证明了它已不是各国人民的世界组织，而日益变成美国嗜杀成性的豪门巨富的战争工具。发言人称：一切爱好和平的人民应该进一步地团结一致，加紧抗美援朝运动，加强并扩大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，粉碎帝国主义战争贩子一切侵略阴谋！
