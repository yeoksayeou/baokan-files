The advanced experience of Jiang Wanshou in improving labor organization at the Northeast No. 1 Garment Factory has now been extended from the garment industry to parts of nine industries, including rubber, leather, machinery, and electrical appliances. After these factories improved their labor organization, production efficiency generally increased by 20% to 80%. In the spring workshop of the Northeast No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, many processes in production had always been done by skilled workers. Therefore, when skilled workers did odd jobs, the machines stopped, reducing production efficiency. In January, based on Jiang Wanshou's experience of increasing assistants, they reorganized the labor force, assigning handling and cutting to assistants, allowing skilled workers to focus on complex technical work, and enabling machines to operate continuously. After this method was implemented in the small spring group of the factory, they completed five months of production tasks in two months and ten days.

During the promotion of Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience, various ideological obstacles were encountered in various enterprises, the most important of which were the conservative ideas of technical personnel, management personnel, and some veteran workers. For example, when a machinery factory began to promote this experience, some technicians and veteran workers believed that Jiang Wanshou's experience was only applicable to the garment industry and not to the machinery industry, which had complex products and precise quality requirements. Only after repeated advocacy by the leadership did they conduct a trial in one group. As a result, all the rough work was assigned to assistants, saving more than half of the veteran workers who were able to specialize in precision skills. In just one month, the man-hours per product were reduced by 63%, and the quality was maintained at the original level. This significant effect reversed the outdated views of some people and recognized that advanced experience is "universally applicable."

Another ideological obstacle that commonly occurred in various enterprises was that some people were afraid of causing confusion in the wage system. Some managers in factories that implemented a time-wage system were concerned that the income from the increased output after adding assistants would not offset the wage expenses for the assistants, which would affect the increase in costs. Technicians in factories that implemented a piece-wage system were concerned that their wages for the increased production would be taken away by the assistants; or they feared that the administrative department would raise the quota and reduce their wage income. These ideological concerns have been largely eliminated after being proven by facts in many factories. For example, one group in a factory used eleven technicians before the labor organization was changed, and produced an average of 18,000 products per month. After the labor organization was changed, ten assistants were added, and 63,107 products were produced in one month, with a total output increase of two and a half times. Due to the increase in output, the average wage of technicians increased by 48.1%, but the wage portion of the cost per product decreased by 42.8%. And the quota was not raised during a certain period.

In addition, some enterprise cadres were also concerned that the continuous operation of machines after adding assistants would accelerate the damage rate of machinery and equipment. These concerns have also been largely eliminated after being proven by facts. For example, after the No. 1 Garment Factory improved its labor organization, not only were the workers not as nervous as before when operating, but the machines were also not as frequently started and stopped as before, with uneven stress. In three months, the number of damaged parts such as "large rings," "shuttles," and "shuttle stalls" in the factory was more than half less than in the three months before the labor organization was improved.

### 先进经验隔行不隔理姜万寿经验推广到东北其他产业部门

　　先进经验隔行不隔理姜万寿经验推广到东北其他产业部门
    东北被服一厂姜万寿改进劳动组织的先进经验，现在已从被服业推广到橡胶、皮革、机械、电器等九个产业的部分工厂中。这些工厂改进劳动组织后，生产效率一般都提高了百分之二十至八十。东北第一机器厂弹簧车间生产中的许多工序，历来都由技工一手去做。因此当技工作零活时，机器就停顿下来，生产效率因而减低。一月份他们根据姜万寿增加帮工的经验，从新组织了劳动力，把搬运、切断等零活改由帮工去做，使技工专心操作复杂的技术工作，使机器能够连续运转。这一方法在该场小型弹簧组实行以后，两个月零十天就完成了五个月的生产任务。
    各企业在推广姜万寿的先进经验中，都曾遇到各种各样的思想阻碍，其中最主要的是技术人员、管理人员与某些老工人的保守思想。如某机械厂开始推广这一经验时，有些技术人员与老工人认为姜万寿的经验只能适用于被服业，对产品复杂、质量精密的机械业不能适用。后经领导方面一再提倡，才在一个小组进行试验。结果由于全部粗活分配给帮工去作，节省出半数以上的老工人能够专事精密的艺技，仅一个月中，每件产品的工时就缩短了百分之六十三，质量也保持原来水平。这一显著效果扭转了某些人员的陈旧观点，认识了先进经验是“隔行不隔理”。
    各企业普遍发生的另一思想阻碍，是有些人怕造成工资制度的混乱。实行计时工资制的工厂的某些管理人员，顾虑增加帮工后，其提高产量部分的收入抵不上给帮工的工资开支，会影响成本的增加。实行计件工资制的工厂的技工，顾虑自己多生产部分的工资会被帮工拿去；或怕行政上提高定额，使工资收入降低。这些思想顾虑在得到许多工厂的事实证明以后，已大部消除。如某厂的一个小组，在劳动组织改变前使用十一个技工，每月平均生产一万八千件产品；劳动组织改变后，增加了十个帮工，一个月就生产了六万三千一百零七件产品，总产量提高二倍半。由于产量提高，技工的工资平均提高了百分之四十八点一，但每件产品成本的工资部分，却降低了百分之四十二点八。而定额在一定的期间并没有提高。
    此外，有些企业的干部还顾虑增加帮工后，机器不停地运转，会加速机器设备的损坏率。这种顾虑在得到了事实证明以后，也都大部消除。如被服一厂改进劳动组织后，不但工人操作时没有以前那样紧张，机器也不像以前那样忽开忽停，着力不均。在三个月中，该厂的“大圈”、“梭头”、“梭挡”等机件的损害数量，较改进劳动组织以前的三个月还减少了一半以上。
