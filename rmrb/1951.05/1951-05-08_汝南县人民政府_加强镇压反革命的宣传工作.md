    Runan County People's Government
    Strengthen Propaganda Work on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
    Editor:
    The People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on April 5th published Comrade Ye Maosheng of the Runan County Federation of Trade Unions' opinion on "Runan County, Henan Province Neglecting Propaganda Work When Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries." This opinion is correct.
    Our county executed twenty-two counter-revolutionary criminals on the afternoon of March 17th. Prior to this, we convened a meeting of cadres from various police stations to arrange for propaganda work exposing the crimes of counter-revolutionary criminals, and dispatched some cadres from the Public Security Bureau, the Justice Section, and the People's Procuratorate to combine with cadres from the police stations to convene mass meetings in various streets to extensively publicize to the masses. Therefore, the masses who participated in the mass meetings were all jubilant and applauded. Everyone said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao, this time you have avenged us people!" However, because the public notices we posted regarding the execution of counter-revolutionary criminals were too simple, such as the notices for the six criminals including Cai Feisi, which were simply written on one sheet, and because a small number of the masses did not sufficiently understand the crimes of the counter-revolutionary criminals, they showed indifference.
    That afternoon, upon our inspection, we discovered this deviation. Therefore, when our county executed the second batch of counter-revolutionary criminals on March 20th, we vigorously strengthened propaganda work. The county People's Government convened a meeting of various police stations, the Chengguan Township People's Government, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Cultural Center, and other organs to arrange work, and used loudspeakers, blackboards, and various meetings to carry out propaganda. When executing the counter-revolutionary criminals, the main cadres of the county People's Government were sent to convene mass meetings to deeply publicize the government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and expose the crimes of the counter-revolutionary criminals. Therefore, the masses' emotions were even more激昂 (ji'ang, aroused/stirred up). In order to support the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries and celebrate the people's victory, they voluntarily repaired the streets, giving the city a completely new look.
    Although the deviation of neglecting propaganda work when suppressing counter-revolutionaries in our county has been corrected, Comrade Ye Maosheng's opinion is still worthy of our vigilance. His suggestion of writing the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements in detail on the judgment documents and posting many copies of the judgment documents or printing them into propaganda materials to widely distribute to the masses is very good; we are willing to accept it in order to make the propaganda work for suppressing counter-revolutionaries even better.

### 汝南县人民政府  加强镇压反革命的宣传工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    汝南县人民政府
    加强镇压反革命的宣传工作编辑同志：
    四月五日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登了汝南县总工会叶茂盛同志对“河南汝南县镇压反革命时忽视宣传工作”的意见。这个意见是正确的。
    我县在三月十七日下午处决了二十二名反革命罪犯。事先我们曾召集各派出所干部开会，布置了揭发反革命罪犯的宣传工作，并派出公安局、司法科及人民检察署等机关的一部分干部结合派出所干部分别召集各街群众大会，广泛地向群众进行宣传。因此，参加群众大会的群众无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快。大家说：“谢谢毛主席，这回可替我们人民报仇出气了。”但是，由于我们所贴处决反革命罪犯的布告写得太简单，如蔡匪思绪等六犯只简单地写了一张，还有少数群众对反革命罪犯的罪行认识不足，表现了漠不关心。
    当天下午，经我们检查，我们就发现了这个偏向。因此，在本县三月二十日处决第二批反革命罪犯时，就大力加强宣传工作。县人民政府事先召集各派出所、城关镇人民政府、工会、青年团、民主妇女联合会、文化馆等机关开会布置工作，利用广播筒、黑板报及各种会议展开宣传。在处决反革命罪犯时又派县人民政府主要干部分别召开群众大会，深入宣传了政府镇压反革命的政策，揭发了反革命罪犯的罪恶。因此，群众情绪更为激昂。他们为了拥护政府镇压反革命、庆祝人民的胜利，就自动修建了街道，使市容焕然一新。
    本县镇压反革命时忽视宣传工作的偏向，虽然已经纠正；但叶茂盛同志的意见仍是值得我们警惕的。他提出的在判决书上详细写明反革命分子的罪行，并将判决书多多张贴或印成宣传品广泛地散发给群众的建议很好；我们愿意接受，以使镇压反革命的宣传工作做得更好。
                河南省汝南县人民政府
