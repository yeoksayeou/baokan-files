The North China Bureau Financial and Economic Work Committee Issues Instructions
Calling on All Regions to Seize the Opportunity to Fight Drought and Plant Cotton

[This newspaper's dispatch] Today is already the Beginning of Summer, and various crops have reached the sowing season, with cotton planting being even more urgent. However, at present, except for Chahar and Shanxi, which are not experiencing drought and can be sown, the three provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, and Suiyuan in the North China region are all experiencing drought, which seriously hinders the completion of the sowing task. To this end, the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an urgent instruction and an important circular on the 3rd of this month, pointing out that fighting drought and sowing seeds, especially the rush planting of cotton, is the most urgent task at present, and introduced the experiences of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces in fighting drought and planting cotton. The instruction and circular pointed out that in order to complete this urgent task, the following points must be noted:

(1) Promote the positive idea of "man can conquer nature," overcome the negative attitude of "waiting for rain," mobilize and organize the vast number of peasants to implement water diversion for irrigation, carrying water by animals, pulling water, carrying water for spot planting, and seizing the opportunity to plant during light rain. As of May 4th, the cotton planted in Hebei Province using this method accounted for 65 percent of the province's cotton planting plan. Pingyuan is also working hard in this way, with Wuzhi County having completed about 60 percent of its planting task, and Jiyuan reaching 80 percent. This is very good. However, some areas still do not attach importance to drought-resistant spot planting, or do not attach enough importance to it. This laissez-faire attitude must be corrected immediately.

(2) Closely integrate the rush planting of cotton with resisting America and aiding Korea. In the vast rural areas of Hebei, accusation meetings and "thinking back" meetings were widely held. The peasants recalled the pain of being harmed by the Japanese invaders in the past, resolutely opposed the United States arming Japan, and unanimously expressed their determination to resist America and aid Korea with the practical action of planting more cotton. Farmers in various villages in Qingyuan County held meetings and thought about the harm they suffered from the Japanese invaders in the past, compared it with the good times now, and unanimously said: "Our good times cannot be destroyed by American imperialism. In order to resist America and aid Korea, we are not afraid of drought and dry land, and we will carry water to plant cotton." Seventeen villages, including Qingbu Village, increased cotton planting by 4,000 mu. After the Hui people in Tangzhuangzi, Ding County, accused the Japanese invaders of slaughtering Hui people, they all said: "Planting cotton is patriotism, and we must plant more." The whole village increased planting by more than 60 mu.

(3) Village cadres and labor models leading peasants to widely organize mutual aid groups is an important link in successfully completing the sowing plan. After the cadres of Xie'erzhai Village in Daming County, Hebei Province, guided everyone to recall the benefits of mutual aid spot planting during the drought two years ago, they immediately organized 19 mutual aid groups, gathered 12 large carts and 20 trailers to pull water, and the whole village finished planting cotton early. Liu Xinjian, a labor model in Anguo, led a spot planting mutual aid group, dividing the work according to the size of the labor force: livestock pulling water, young adults carrying water, and women sowing seeds, so that spot planting was much faster. In Pingyuan, the Jing Zhicai group in Wuzhi had four male full laborers in charge of carrying water and four female full laborers in charge of digging holes, and all ten mu of cotton fields were planted in two days. Facts have proved that by organizing and helping each other in production, the task of spot planting and rush planting can be successfully completed.

(4) Fully and rationally use all water sources. Yongnian, Linzhang, and Wei County, at the beginning, some farmers thought that the land was too dry to plant, so the village cadres led everyone to check the soil moisture. Most of the land could be planted by seizing the moisture, and then rushed to plant. In this way, less land was used for water, and the water was enough. Private water channels and wells, in addition to ensuring their private use rights, can persuade well owners and channel owners to save water and organize mutual assistance based on the principle of mutual benefit, or give the well owners a certain reward to supply water to drought-stricken households. Some villages in Pingyuan have organized drought-resistance headquarters or water management committees to unify the leadership of water use, and have formulated covenants after discussions with the masses in the village, so that water sources can exert the greatest efficiency and everyone has water to use. These methods are all very good. Those without water channels, wells, or far from water channels and wells should dig wells immediately, which is still timely. Experience from the previous year proves that many farmers in Hebei and Pingyuan helped each other to dig wells in groups of three, completing an earthen well in one day.

(5) Highly promote the drought-resistance experience and wisdom of labor models, veteran farmers, and technical experts, study and promote spot planting techniques (such as watering first, then sowing seeds, then sealing wet soil, then sealing dry soil), water-retaining experience, and methods of protecting seedlings to overcome drought and strive for a bumper harvest.

Finally, the instruction emphasized that sowing is a time-sensitive task. If the leadership does not grasp it tightly and misses the time, it will not only cause losses to farmers for a year, but also affect the recovery and development of urban industry, as well as support for resisting America and aiding Korea. Therefore, leaders at all levels must take the completion of the sowing plan, especially the completion of the cotton planting task, as the only central task at present. Other long-term tasks can be temporarily postponed or suspended. The main responsible cadres at all levels must personally take action and grasp the leadership tightly. For example, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, have personally gone deep into various places to inspect work, which has played a great role in promoting cotton planting. In addition, a large number of cadres should be organized to go to the countryside to inspect and help, mobilize party members and league members to take the lead, and urge village branches and village governments to quickly formulate drought-resistant spot planting plans for each village and household, and mobilize the vast number of farmers to rush to complete the task of planting cotton and other various crops in ten days to half a month.

### 华北局财经工作委员会发出指示  号召各地抓紧时机抗旱植棉

　　华北局财经工作委员会发出指示
    号召各地抓紧时机抗旱植棉
    【本报讯】今日已经立夏，各种作物已到下种时期，植棉更为紧迫。但目前华北全区除察哈尔和山西不旱，能够播种外，河北、平原、绥远三省均呈旱象，严重地妨害着播种任务的完成。为此，中共中央华北局财经工作委员会于本月三日发出紧急指示和重要通报，指出抗旱下种，特别是突击植棉，乃是当前最紧急的任务，并介绍河北、平原两省抗旱植棉的经验。该指示与通报指出，为完成这一紧急任务，必须注意以下几点：
    （一）发扬“人定胜天”的积极思想，克服“等天落雨”的消极情绪，动员和组织广大农民，实行引水浇种，驮水、拉水、担水点种和趁小雨抢种。至五月四日止，河北用这种办法种上的棉花，占该省植棉计划的百分之六十五。平原亦抓紧这样作，武陟全县下种任务已完成百分之六十左右，济源已达百分之八十。这是很好的。但也有些地区，至今对抗旱点种，仍未重视，或重视不够。这种自流放任态度，必须立加纠正。
    （二）把突击植棉与抗美援朝密切结合起来。河北广大农村普遍召开了控诉会、想想会，农民回忆过去受日寇残害的痛苦，坚决反对美国武装日本，一致表示要用多种棉花的实际行动抗美援朝。清苑县各村农民开会，想了想过去受日寇的祸害，比了比现在的好光景，一致说：“咱们的好光景不能让美帝国主义破坏。为了抗美援朝，不怕天旱地干，挑水也要种上棉花。”该县青堡等十七村，增种了棉花四千亩。定县唐庄子回民们，控诉了日寇屠杀回民罪行后，都说：“种棉就是爱国，咱可得多种。”全村增种了六十多亩。
    （三）村干部、劳动模范领导农民广泛组织互助组，是顺利完成播种计划的重要环节。河北大名县谢儿寨村干部，引导大家回想前年天旱互助点种的好处后，随即组织了十九个互助组，凑了十二辆大车、二十辆拖车拉水，全村早早地把棉花种完了。安国劳动模范刘辛建领导了一个点种互助组，按劳力大小分工：牲口拉水，青壮年挑水，妇女撒种，这样点种就快多了。平原武陟景治才组，四个男全劳力，专管担水，四个女全劳力专管挖坑，把十亩棉田两天全部种完。事实证明：组织起来，互助生产，就能顺利完成点种、抢种的突击任务。
    （四）充分合理使用所有水源。永年、临漳、魏县，开头有些农民认为地干种不上，村干部就领着大家验墒，大部分地能抢墒种，随着就突击抢种，这样用水的地少了，水就够用了。私人的水渠、水井，除确保其私人使用权外，可说服井主、渠主，节约水量，并根据自愿两利原则组织互助，或给予井主一定报酬，供给旱地户用水。平原有的村庄为统一用水的领导，组织了抗旱指挥部或用水管理委员会，经过全村群众讨论，订出公约，使得水源发挥最大效能，大家都有水用。这些办法都是很好的。无水渠、水井或距水渠、水井较远者，应即打井，尚来得及。前年经验证明，河北、平原不少农民，三人互助打井，日成土井一眼。
    （五）高度发扬劳动模范、老农和技术能手抗旱经验与智慧，研究与推广点种技术（如先浇水，后下种，再封湿土，后封干土）、养墒经验和保护小苗的办法，以战胜天旱，争取丰收。
    最后，该指示强调指出：播种是一个有时间性的任务，如领导上抓不紧，错过时间，不但会造成农民一年损失，而且影响城市工业的恢复与发展，以及对抗美援朝的支援。因此，各级领导，均须以完成播种计划，特别是完成植棉任务，为当前唯一的中心任务。其他时间性长的工作可暂时缓办或停办。各级主要负责干部必须亲自动手，抓紧领导，例如河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰和平原省人民政府副主席罗玉川均曾亲自深入各地检查工作，对推动植棉工作起了很大作用。此外，并应组织大批干部下乡检查、帮助，动员党员、团员带头，督促村支部和村政府迅速订出一村一户的抗旱点种计划，发动广大农民，用十天到半月的时间，突击完成植棉与其他各种作物的任务。
