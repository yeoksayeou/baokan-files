　　The so-called Wu Xun's "bearing humiliation and heavy burdens" is to shoulder the "important responsibilities" of feudal lords
To the Editor:
    My view of Wu Xun in the past has been completely wrong. I thought his behavior of kneeling and begging in front of people and willingly accepting insults in order to "beg for schooling" was simply an incredible miracle. I was once fascinated by Wu Xun's "spirit" of "single-minded devotion" for thirty years, believing that Wu Xun was a good example of "bearing humiliation and heavy burdens," a respectable and admirable figure. Since reading the People's Daily's criticism of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun," I have had a preliminary correct understanding of Wu Xun. I realized that the past view of Wu Xun "bearing humiliation and heavy burdens" was from the standpoint of the feudal ruling class. In order to beg for the favor of "officials and dignitaries," Wu Xun "sincerely" knelt for three days and three nights; in order to accumulate funds for "free schools," he willingly endured humiliation. This kind of Wu Xun's self-abasement, spineless behavior, has no similarity to the noble image of the working people's wisdom, simplicity, integrity, and diligence, and is completely unworthy of praise. Wu Xun's "bearing humiliation and heavy burdens" to "run schools" actually cultivated "loyal subjects," "martyrs," "filial sons," and "virtuous grandsons" for the ruling class. We know that the peasants' immediate problem at that time was to smash the reactionary rule that weighed heavily on their heads. The vigorous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement was this kind of fierce class struggle. But Wu Xun used the issue of "literacy" to cover up the crimes of the feudal ruling class, and used "establishing free schools" to maintain popular support for the ruling class and whitewash the peace. This had a counter-effect on the class consciousness and fighting will of the peasants at that time. The peasants wanted to revolt against the ruling class, but Wu Xun evaded reality and took the path of reformism, compromise, and surrender. Therefore, it can be said that Wu Xun was a slave who hindered the progress of history and served the ruling class; he was by no means a figure who should be praised. My past "inspiration" from Wu Xun's "ability to be humble" and "bearing humiliation and heavy burdens" was a completely wrong view.

### 所谓武训“忍辱负重”是担负封建主的“重任”

专栏：读者来信

　　所谓武训“忍辱负重”是担负封建主的“重任”编辑同志：
    过去我对武训的看法一直是错误的。我认为他在人前跪求、甘愿受侮的“行乞兴学”的行为，简直是了不起的奇迹。我曾一度为武训三十年如一日“专心致志”的“精神”所迷惑，认为武训是“忍辱负重”的优良范例，是可钦可敬的人物。自从读了人民日报关于武训与电影《武训传》的批评文字以后，我才对武训有了初步的正确的认识。我认识了过去认为武训“忍辱负重”是站在封建统治阶级立场所说的话。武训为了哀求“达官贵人”的恩典，就“虔诚”地跪上三天三夜；为了积聚“义学”的资金，竟甘心情愿地任人侮辱。武训这种自卑自贱，软骨头的行为，与劳动人民智慧、朴质、正直、勤劳的高贵形象一点也没有相似之处，是完全不应该赞颂的。武训“忍辱负重”地“兴学”，实际上替统治阶级培养了“忠臣”、“烈士”、“孝子”、“贤孙”。我们知道当时农民的切身问题，是打碎重压在他们头上的反动统治，轰轰烈烈的太平天国革命运动，就是这种剧烈的阶级斗争。但武训却以“识字”问题来掩饰封建统治阶级的罪恶，以“兴义学”来为统治阶级维系人心，粉饰太平。这对当时农民的阶级意识与斗争意志来说，是起着反作用的。农民要革统治阶级的命，武训却逃避现实，走改良主义与妥协投降的路线。所以说：武训是阻碍历史向前发展，为统治阶级服务的奴才；决不是应该歌颂的人物。我过去为武训的“能下人”与“忍辱负重”精神所“感召”，完全是一种错误看法。
