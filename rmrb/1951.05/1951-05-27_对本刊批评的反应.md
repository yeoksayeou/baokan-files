Reactions to Criticisms from This Publication

*Sub-North Jiangsu Daily Accepts Reader Criticisms*

Editor:

After seeing the criticism of our newspaper published in the People's Daily Book Review section on April 8th, we immediately conducted a review and preliminarily developed improvement measures.

From January to the present, we have received nine submissions from Comrade Yang Yang (the remaining submissions and letters were received before January). One of them, an opinion regarding the Shanggang Township Post Office in Yancheng, has been forwarded to the Shanggang Post Office for review and a public response will be made. The rest have not been processed.

The main reason for the above shortcomings is insufficient dedication to serving correspondents. In the past, due to unscientific working methods in various groups, coupled with a shortage of personnel and a large number of submissions, we could only focus on returning submissions of key importance. For general submissions, we would conduct periodic reviews, uniformly propose rejection opinions, and publish them in professional publications before sending them back to the correspondents along with the rejected submissions. However, we did not do this regularly, and for general submissions, we neither returned them nor provided political and professional guidance to correspondents through professional publications.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings and improve correspondence work, we are conducting a study on the mass work of newspapers to further develop a plan for improving the mass work of newspapers. In the future, we plan to do the following: (1) All submissions and letters must be registered in detail and archives established; (2) After receiving submissions from correspondents, for those with preservation value for reference, the author will be immediately notified with a postcard and a brief explanation provided; (3) For unused submissions, a simple contact letter will be sent to each, outlining the handling opinion; for the more important ones, detailed opinions will be provided to the author; (4) Publish "Correspondence and Reading" periodically to strengthen ties with correspondents.

*Letter from Zhenqiu Geography and Topography Society*

Editor:

I have just read Comrade Liming's serious criticism in the May 6th "Book Review" of the "Latest Chinese Geography Map for Junior and Senior Primary Schools" published by our society. I read it several times with great apprehension, which has given me great education and encouragement. Due to my negligence in proofreading, the textual explanations on the map contained many extremely serious errors. I am very grateful to Comrade Li for pointing them out one by one. In the future, I will absolutely guarantee that the publishing work is done well. In addition to expressing my apologies to the readers, I will also follow Comrade Li's suggestion to cease sales and reissue it after correction. This letter serves as a reply.

*Letter from Xinong Publishing House*

Editor:

We believe that Comrade Yuan Zulie's criticism of "General Crop Science" compiled by Zhang Jinxiang, published by our house, is completely correct. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Comrade Yuan and your publication.

Regarding Zhang's "General Crop Science," it has now been decided to completely rewrite the first section, "The Importance of Crops," and the first section of the first chapter of the second section, "General Discussion." Regarding other errors caused by revision negligence, a separate errata sheet will be compiled and attached to the end of the book to remedy them.

We have also decided to extend the inspection work to all manuscripts in our publishing house: reviewing and correcting those already published, and strengthening the review of those not yet published. Sales of Zhang's book have been suspended from today.

*Letter from Jia Publishing House*

Editor:

Reading "The Issue of Book Pricing" in your May 13th issue, it was mentioned that our publishing house's books still use the base price system. Comrade Shen Zhifang pointed out in the article that "in today's stable RMB exchange rate, it is unnecessary to retain the base price system." We completely agree with this opinion. Our publishing house has decided to adopt currency pricing for all books published in the future. Thank you very much for your publication's and Comrade Shen's help and correction.

　　对本刊批评的反应
            苏北日报接受本报读者批评意见编辑同志：
    看到四月八日人民日报书报评论所刊对本报的批评后，当即进行了检查，并初步研究出改进办法。
    从一月份至今，共收到杨扬同志来稿九件（其余稿件、信件在一月份前收到），内有一篇对盐城上冈乡邮局的意见，已转上冈邮局检查，作公开答复，其余均未处理。
    产生上述缺点的原因，主要是为通讯员服务的精神不够。过去由于各组工作方法不科学，再加人少稿多，所以只能做到有重点的退稿；对一般性的稿件则定期研究，统一提出退稿意见，在业务刊物上发表后，连同退稿一起送给通讯员。但是，我们没有经常这样做，对一般的稿件既不退还，也没有通过业务刊物对通讯员进行政治上和业务上的指导。
    为了克服上述缺点，搞好通讯工作，我们正在进行关于报纸群众工作的学习，以进一步订出改进报纸群众工作的计划。今后，我们准备这样做：（一）来稿、来信必须详细登记，并建立档案；（二）在收到通讯员来稿后，对有保存作参考价值的稿件当即用明信片通知作者，并作简要说明；（三）对不用稿件，逐一发出简单联系信，提出处理意见；其中比较重要的，一律提出详细意见告诉作者；（四）定期出版《通讯与读报》，以加强和通讯员的联系。

  新农出版社来函编辑同志：
    袁祖烈同志对我社出版张金相编“普通作物学”提出的批评，我们认为是完全正确的。我们谨对袁同志和你刊表示由衷的感谢。
    关于张编“普通作物学”现已决定把第一篇“作物之重要”一节，和第二篇第一章第一节“总论”全部重写，关于其他因修订疏忽而犯的错误，另编勘误表附在书末，以资补救。
    我们并决定把检查工作深入到我社全部书稿中去：检讨修正已出版的，加强审读未出版的。张书已自即日起暂停发售。
        新农出版社五月一五日
  家出版社来函编辑同志：
    读五月十三日你刊“书籍的标价问题”，提到我社书籍仍用基价制度，沈芷芳同志在该文中指出“在人民币币值已稳定的今天，还保留着基价制度，是不必要的。”我们完全同意这个意见。我社决定对于今后出版的书籍，一律采用货币定价。多谢你刊和沈同志的帮助和指正。
                家出版社  五月十五日
