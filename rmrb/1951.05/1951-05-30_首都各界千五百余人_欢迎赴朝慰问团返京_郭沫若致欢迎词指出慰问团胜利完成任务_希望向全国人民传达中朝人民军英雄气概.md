Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, with over 500 members led by Head of Delegation Liao Chengzhi and Deputy Heads Chen Yi and Tian Han, arrived in Beijing by train from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 29th.

More than 1,500 people, including Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, and Li Jishen, were at the station to welcome them. Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, also came to the station to welcome them.

As the train pulled into the station, all members of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea alighted amidst the sounds of military music and cheers from the welcomers. The welcomers held a welcoming ceremony at the station. Representatives from the Korean Embassy in China first presented flowers to the Head of Delegation Liao Chengzhi and Deputy Heads Chen Yi and Tian Han to express their respect.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered a welcoming speech. He extended a warm welcome to all members of the delegation on behalf of the China Peace Committee, and expressed his high respect and sincere condolences to the four martyrs who gloriously sacrificed their lives in the delegation. He pointed out that the delegation, representing all the people of China, visited the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people, giving them great encouragement and comfort. Guo Moruo said, "We hope that you will convey to the people of the whole country the heroic spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who combine arduous and heroic combat with a high degree of internationalism and patriotism; we hope that you will convey to the people of the whole country the patriotic spirit and actions of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people. In this way, we can further popularize, deepen, and sustain the current central task of our people - the Resist America, Aid Korea movement." Guo Moruo said, "The people of the whole country also hope that you will report to them the brutal atrocities of the American imperialist aggressor groups that you have seen and heard in Korea, and raise the people's hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism. We hope you will happily, quickly and successfully complete this task."

Liao Chengzhi, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, delivered a reply. After explaining that the delegation had successfully completed its mission to visit Korea, he said, "The first thing we want to tell everyone upon returning to our motherland is that the anti-American war of the Chinese and Korean people is bound to be victorious. We have seen how brutal and shameless the American invading army is, and how heroic and strong our Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, are. They have severely struck the enemy, defended the security of the motherland, and helped the Korean people's struggle for liberation. Therefore, we feel even more how great and lovable our motherland is, and how happy we Chinese people are to live in the era of Mao Zedong. We should use greater strength to promote the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and unremittingly support our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean military and civilians until the final and complete victory of the anti-American war."

The welcoming ceremony ended after members of the Beijing Municipal Children's Team presented flowers to the Head of Delegation Liao Chengzhi and Deputy Heads Chen Yi and Tian Han. (Attached picture)

    郭沫若致欢迎词指出慰问团胜利完成任务
    希望向全国人民传达中朝人民军英雄气概
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国人民赴朝慰问团一行五百余人在团长廖承志、副团长陈沂、田汉率领之下，于二十九日下午自天津乘车抵达北京。
    到车站欢迎的有郭沫若、彭真、陈叔通、李济深等共一千五百余人。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使李周渊亦到车站欢迎。
    列车进站后，中国人民赴朝慰问团全体团员在军乐声和欢迎者的欢呼声中下车。欢迎者在车站举行了欢迎会。朝鲜驻华大使馆代表首先向慰问团团长廖承志、副团长陈沂、田汉献花致敬。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若致欢迎词。他代表抗美援朝总会向慰问团全体人员表示热烈的欢迎，并向慰问团中光荣牺牲的四位烈士表示崇高的敬意和诚恳的悼念。他指出：慰问团代表全中国人民慰问中国人民志愿军，慰问朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，给了中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民以极大的鼓励和安慰。郭沫若说：我们希望你们把中国人民志愿军艰苦卓绝的英勇战斗、高度的国际主义和爱国主义相结合的新英雄气概向全国人民传达；希望你们把朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民的爱国精神和行动向全国人民传达。这样，把我们全国人民当前的中心任务——抗美援朝运动更进一步地普及、深入和持久下去。郭沫若说：全国人民还希望你们把在朝鲜所见所闻的美帝国主义侵略集团的残暴兽行报告给全国人民，提高全国人民仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的思想。希望你们愉快地、迅速地胜利完成这项任务。
    中国人民赴朝慰问团团长廖承志致答词，他在说明慰问团已胜利完成赴朝慰问的任务后说：我们回到祖国来，首先要告诉大家的是：中、朝两国人民的抗美战争是必然要胜利的。我们看到美国侵略军是那样的残暴无耻，而与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的我国人民志愿军又是那么的英勇坚强，他们已经严重地打击了敌人，保卫祖国的安全，帮助朝鲜人民的解放斗争。因此，我们更加感觉我们祖国的伟大可爱，更加感觉我们中国人民生活在毛泽东时代的幸福。我们应该用更大的力量来推行抗美援朝运动，坚持不懈地支援我国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民，直到抗美战争的最后的完全的胜利。
