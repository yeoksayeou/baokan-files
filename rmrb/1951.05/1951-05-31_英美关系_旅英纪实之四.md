　　Anglo-American Relations
　　—A Travelogue in Britain, Part Four
　　Wu Wentao
　　On February 22nd, my last day leaving London, the British House of Commons staged a lively farce. This play was triggered by the appointment of the American, Fechteler, as the Supreme Naval Commander of the Atlantic Treaty Organization.
　　When Attlee announced this appointment in the House of Commons, the warmonger Churchill, feigning patriotism, stood up indignantly to question it, saying: "…I believe our country should not fall into such a humiliating position…Is there no British admiral who can perform this task?" Then many young conservatives joined the debate. Attlee was forced to blush, speechless, and could only parry briefly before retreating to fight another day.
　　This incident sparked a series of commentaries and letters to the editor in British newspapers. The *New Statesman and Nation*, a magazine associated with the Labour Party and advocating liberalism, stated in its editorial:
　　"Mr. Attlee's failure lies in that, for the past twelve months, he has deemed it unnecessary to correctly and openly tell us about the loss of sovereignty encompassed by the Atlantic Pact…" "Of course, he (referring to Churchill) and his colleagues have never, on any practical issue, suggested that the government should stand up to the Americans… But this time, merely on the question of dignity, Mr. Churchill has been given a wonderful opportunity to show off, to adorn himself as the protector of Nelson's compatriots, demanding the semblance of independence from the Americans while offering them the substance of independence." (See the editorial of the March 3rd issue of the magazine)
　　Then, people might ask: since one side is surrendering its power and the other is selling out independence, why did Churchill stage this play? The reason is that the reactionary British rulers have brought Britain to the brink of war, and the people have begun to realize it. Especially after Britain joined the American war of aggression against Korea, people realized from their own daily lives that Britain had become a vassal in its relationship with the United States. The representatives of the reactionary bourgeoisie, with a guilty conscience, were vying to show their "innocence" before the people.
　　A brief review of post-war history is necessary. For several years, American monopolists have been "aiding" Britain and other Western European capitalist countries. Churchill—Attlee—Bevin and others were all moved to tears of gratitude. Their mantra was: "Without American aid, it would be impossible to recover from the wartime wounds and impossible to make up for the imbalance of national revenue and expenditure."
　　However, simply examining the situation of Britain's deficit shows that from January 1946 to June 1949, the total deficit was 1.13 billion pounds, while during the same period, expenditures for conducting predatory and suppressive military operations against the revolutionary struggles of the people in overseas colonies (such as "aiding" the Greek royalist fascists and suppressing the people's liberation movements in Malaya and other places) amounted to 806 million pounds. If other military expenditures are added, it equals the entire deficit. It can be said that the reason for the imbalance of Britain's financial revenue and expenditure is precisely the anti-people war waged by British imperialism after the war. (The above figures are from Dutt's *Crisis of Britain and the British Empire*, page 197 of the English version.)
　　Of course, a major condition for accepting "American aid" was to carry out such military adventures. Professor Cole, a famous Labour Party propagandist and former chairman of the Fabian Society, wrote in the April 5, 1947 issue of the *New Statesman and Nation* magazine:
　　"The existence of loans allows the Americans to impose some burdens on us (referring to Britain)… If we could refuse the loans, it would immediately allow us to limit our military and imperial burdens, and at the same time reach an understanding with the Soviet Union."
　　This also clearly reveals another important condition of "American aid," namely: not to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union, to cut off trade between Britain and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe, and to make Britain rely on the dollar market for the food, raw materials, etc. it needs to import. For example, at the Washington Wheat Conference, the Soviet Union proposed an annual export quantity that could satisfy the entire wheat import of Western Europe with some left over, but it was rejected by the American tycoons, with the aim of continuously raising the price of wheat they controlled. The situation for other grains, meat, timber, metals, etc., is the same. Regarding the export of British industrial products, according to estimates by the London *Financial Times*, the Soviet Union, which is busy with peaceful construction day and night, has a capacity for importing machinery roughly equal to the entire production capacity of British machinery manufacturing (supplement to the machinery industry in the October 24, 1949 issue of the newspaper). However, under the conditions of "American aid," Wall Street holds the power of veto, preventing British-produced machinery from being exported to the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe, and China.
　　A year ago, the devaluation of the pound was nominally said to facilitate British exports to the dollar market in order to make up for the dollar deficit, but in reality, it was also a product of American pressure. The result of the devaluation was that the price of British export goods decreased in terms of gold dollars, but the prices of imported food and raw materials increased simultaneously in terms of pounds. That is to say, Britain must export more than one-third more finished products in order to exchange for the same amount of raw materials as before the devaluation. As a result, the prices of domestic consumer goods in Britain continue to rise; at the same time, the increase in the exchange rate of the dollar against the pound greatly facilitates the investment of American financial groups in the pound area, which is a bone-scraping and marrow-sucking method for the British Empire.
　　The best explanation for American control of Britain is the latter's war preparations under the Atlantic Treaty Organization. Following Truman's lead, Attlee and others rejected the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to abolish atomic weapons and for major powers to reduce their armaments and troops, and instead frantically engaged in military expansion and war preparations. During the period of 1951-52, Britain's military budget increased to 4.7 billion pounds (which is equivalent to a burden of about two and a half pounds per week for every family in the entire British population!). As a result, a large number of British machinery manufacturing equipment and workers will be transferred to the production of the military industry. One of the obvious consequences is necessarily the reduction of the export potential of the British machinery manufacturing industry—the trump card of British manufactured goods in the international market—while ceding the market to American monopolists. Due to the input of light metals such as zinc and copper into military industrial production, 75 small and medium-sized factories manufacturing household appliances in Birmingham alone are facing bankruptcy, and another 160 factories will also substantially reduce their workforce. (Worker's Daily, January 12th) The rise in domestic prices in Britain, the reduction of the actual wages of the working people, and the increase in taxes are even more self-evident. It can be said that the relationship between Britain and the United States is a depiction of the internal relations of the imperialist camp today. As the overall crisis of capitalism deepens after the war and the capitalist world shrinks, the American bourgeoisie, which holds 60 percent of the productive forces of the capitalist world, often tries to solve its own economic crisis by eroding the economies of other weaker capitalist countries. In this increasingly fierce competition, the first to bear the brunt, of course, is the British Empire, which still possesses a large number of overseas colonies.
　　Regarding this point, the Vice-Chairman of the British Communist Party, Dutt, wrote in his recent book *The Crisis of Britain and the British Empire*:
　　"The anti-Soviet 'Cold War' of American imperialist expansion policy is openly admitted and unabashed; the anti-British Empire expansion policy of American imperialism is hidden, not openly admitted, but this true fact is covered up with eulogies and friendly rhetoric." (Page 46 of the English version of the book)
　　Indeed, throughout the world, one can see the contradictions between the interests of British and American imperialism. The so-called "Schuman Plan," in which American monopolists attempt to combine the coal and steel of the Ruhr with the coal and iron enterprises of France in order to attack the British coal and steel industry, is the most heartbreaking thing for British capitalists. In the Middle East, where British capital has monopolized for eighty years, American capital has taken advantage of the situation to enter; the fierce Anglo-American oil war has escalated to the recent assassination of the Iranian Prime Minister. In the Far East, in addition to the fact that the infiltration of dollars into British colonies is a major concern for British monopolized capital, the rearmament of Japan by the United States also includes the competition between Japanese textiles controlled by the United States and British textiles in the Asian market. Even the so-called "embargo against China," which American imperialism has repeatedly pressured Britain on, has caused British capitalists and newspapers related to the Hong Kong economy to cry out in opposition…
　　As early as ten years ago, when discussing the Atlantic Charter, the then British Prime Minister Churchill said to the late former American President Roosevelt:
　　"Mr. President, I believe you are trying to dismantle the British Empire… But, anyway, we know you are our only hope. We understand this, and you know it. You know we understand that without the United States, the Empire (referring to the British Empire) cannot stand." (Elliott Roosevelt's *As He Saw It*, page 41 of the English version)
　　This is the heartfelt statement of the reactionary British bourgeoisie. In order to maintain its bloody rule over colonies and semi-colonies and pursue the profits of war, it does not hesitate to slavishly follow American imperialism in preparing for new war adventures, placing the British people in mortal danger. We already know that the fact that the British war economy has caused the prices of consumer goods to soar and the people's lives to deteriorate day by day, while at the same time, the profits of British capitalists are increasing. In 1950 alone, the profits of the British rich increased by 20 percent compared to 1949.
　　The relationship between British and American imperialism, and the fact that American monopolists today control the entire capitalist world, do not explain anything else, but rather explain the weakening and deepening crisis of the capitalist world, and explain that imperialism is increasingly approaching its grave. The people of the powerful countries of the peace and democracy camp are consistent with the interests of the British people who demand to break free from the shackles of Wall Street. Warmongers spread rumors to the British people, saying: "The Soviet army can reach the opposite side of the English Channel in sixty hours!..." I saw many people asking in the readers' letters section of British newspapers: "Since the Red Army can strike at the edge of Britain in one fell swoop, why has it not struck yet, and allowed Britain and the United States to prepare for war?" The British people clearly know that the Soviet Union loves peace. In Britain, many knowledgeable people from all walks of life have issued warnings: if Britain dares to follow the United States in making new war adventures, then the first thing that will happen is the destruction of the reactionary bourgeoisie of the British Empire!

　　英美关系
    ——旅英纪实之四
    吴文焘
    二月二十二日，我离开伦敦的头一天，英国下院演了一幕短打戏，非常热闹。这幕戏是由于美国人费区勒被任命为大西洋侵略公约国家的最高海军司令官而引起的。
    当艾德礼在下院宣布了这个任命后，战争贩子邱吉尔装出一付爱国相，怒冲冲地起立质问，他说：“…………我认为我们的国家不应沦入如此屈辱的地位…………没有一个英国海军上将能执行这项任务吗？”接着很多保守党的小将们也加入论战了。艾德礼被逼得涨红了脸，无言以对，只好招架一番，收兵改期再战。
    这件事，在英国的报纸上引起了一系列的评论和读者来信。和工党有关、标榜自由主义的《新政治家与民族》杂志的社论中，有这样一段话：
    “艾德礼先生的失败，在于过去十二个月以来，他认为不须要正确而公开地告诉我们大西洋公约所包含的主权的丧失……。”“当然，他（指邱吉尔）和他的同人们，从来也没有在任何有关实际的问题上，提出政府应向美国人挺起腰板来……。但在这次，仅仅由于尊严的问题，邱吉尔先生便得到一个炫示的绝妙机会，把自己装饰成纳尔逊的同胞的保护人，从美国人手里要求独立的形影，而把独立的实质奉送给他们。”（见三月三日该刊社论）
    那么，人们要问了：既然一方是丧权，另方是出卖独立，为什么邱吉尔要表演这幕戏呢？原因就在于反动的英国统治者们把英国带到了战争的边沿，而人民已经开始察觉了。特别是在英国参加了美国的侵朝战争以后，人们从切身的日常生活问题上认识到：在对美国的关系上，英国已经变成了附庸。作贼心虚的反动资产阶级的代表们，就在人民面前竞相卖弄“清白”。
    简单回顾一下战后的历史是必要的。几年来，美国的垄断资本家们在“援助”着英国和其他西欧资本主义国家。邱吉尔——艾德礼——贝文们对之都是感激涕零的。他们的口头禅是：“没有美援，就无法恢复战时的创伤，就不能弥补国家收支的不平衡。”
    但是，单只检查一下英国收支亏欠的情况，就知道：从一九四六年一月到一九四九年六月的期间，亏欠总数为十一亿三千万镑，而在同一期间的支出中，为了进行掠夺和镇压海外殖民地人民的革命斗争的军费（“援助”希腊保皇法西斯、镇压马来亚等地的人民解放运动）一项，即为八亿零六百万镑。如果加上其他的军事开支，就等于全部的亏空额。那么，可以说，英国财政收支不能平衡的原因，正是英帝国主义者在战后进行的反人民战争所造成的。（以上数字见杜德著《英帝国的危机》英文本第一九七页）
    当然，接受“美援”的一个主要条件，就是要进行这种军事冒险。工党的著名宣传家、前“费边社”主席柯尔教授在一九四七年四月五日的《新政治家与民族》杂志上这样写道：
    “借款的存在，使美国人得以给我们（指英国）加上一些负担………如果能够拒绝借款的话，就会使我们立即限制我们的军事和帝国的负担，同时和苏联达到谅解。”
    这里也很清楚地道出了“美援”的另一个重要条件，即：不与苏联谅解，杜绝英国与苏联及东欧人民民主国家的贸易，使英国所需要进口的食品、原料等依靠美元市场。例如：在华盛顿小麦会议上，苏联提出每年可以输出的数量，可以满足整个西欧小麦的进口而有余，但为美国的大亨们所拒绝，目的是要使他们自己掌握下的小麦价格不断抬高。其他杂粮、肉类、木材、金属等的情况，都是一样。在英国工业品的输出上，据伦敦《金融时报》估计，日夜忙于和平建设的苏联，对于进口机器的容受量，约等于英国机器制造业的全部生产量（该报一九四九年十月二十四日机器工业附刊），可是，在“美援”的条件下，华尔街掌握着否决权，使英国生产的机器，不能向苏联、东欧人民民主国家和中国输出。
    一年前，英镑的贬值，名义上说是便利英国对美元市场上的输出，以求弥补美元的亏空，实际上，这也是美国压力下的产物。贬值的结果，使英国出口货价格以金元计算降低了，但进口的食品和原料的价格，以英镑计算同时也就抬高了。这就是说，英国必须多出口三分之一以上的成品，才能换回与贬值以前同量的原料物资来。因之，英国国内消费品的价格就不断上涨；同时，由于美元对英镑比价的提高，大大便利了美国财阀们向英镑领域的投资，这对于大英帝国是一种敲骨及髓的办法。
    美国控制了英国的最好说明，就是后者在大西洋侵略公约下的备战措施。紧跟着杜鲁门的屁股，艾德礼们拒绝了苏联所一再提议的废除原子武器、各大国裁减军备与军队的建议，而疯狂地进行扩军备战。一九五一——五二年期间，英国的军事预算增加到四十七亿镑（这约等于英国全人口中每家每周两镑半的负担！）因而，英国大批的机器制造业的装备和工人，将随之转入军火工业的生产。其明显的后果之一，必然是英国机器制造业——英国制造品在国际市场上的王牌输出潜能的降低，而把市场让给美国的垄断资本家们。由于锌、铜等轻金属的投入军火工业生产，单只北明翰就有七十五个制造家庭用具的中小工厂面临倒闭，另外有一六○个厂，亦将大量裁减工人。（工人日报一月十二日）英国国内物价上涨，劳动人民实际工资的降低和捐税的增加等，更是不在话下的。可以说，英美的关系，就是今天帝国主义阵营内部关系的一个写照。在战后资本主义总危机日益加深、资本主义世界日益缩小的情况下，握有资本主义世界生产力百分之六十的美国资产阶级，就经常以消蚀其他较弱的资本主义国家的经济，来试图解决其自身的经济危机。在这种日益尖锐化的竞争中，首当其冲的，当然是至今仍拥有大量海外殖民地的大英帝国。
    关于这点，英共副主席杜德在其近著《英帝国的危机》一书中写道：
    “美帝国主义扩张政策反苏的‘冷战’，是公开的自认不讳的，美帝国主义扩张政策反不列颠帝国，是隐匿的，未经公开承认的，但这个真正事实是用颂扬与友好的饰词掩盖起来了。”（该书英文本第四六页）
    的确，在全世界范围内，处处可以看到英、美帝国主义利益的矛盾。美国垄断资本家们企图把鲁尔的煤钢和法国的煤铁企业结合起来、以打击英国煤钢业的所谓“舒曼计划”，是英国资本家们最为伤心的事。在英国资本垄断了八十年的中东，已为美国资本乘虚而入；英美石油战的激烈，演到最近伊朗总理的被刺杀。在远东，除了美元浸透到英国的殖民地是英国垄断资本的心腹之患外，美国重新武装日本，也包含着在美国控制下的日本纺织品在亚洲市场上与英国纺织品的竞争。就是美帝国主义一再向英国施压力的所谓“对华禁运”，已使得与香港经济有关的英国资本家和报纸大呼反对起来…。
    早在十年前，在会谈大西洋宪章的时候，当时的英国首相邱吉尔就对已故的前美总统罗斯福说过：
    “总统先生，我相信你是在试图瓦解大英帝国的。……但是，不管怎样，我们知道你们是我们唯一的希望。我们了解这一点，你是知道的。你知道我们了解：没有美国，帝国（指大英帝国）是站不住的。”（艾里奥特·罗斯福著《罗斯福见闻录》英文本第四一页）
    这就是英国反动资产阶级的衷心话。他们要维持其对殖民地、半殖民地的血腥统治和追逐战争的利润，就不惜奴颜地追随美国帝国主义准备新的战争冒险，而将英国人民置于死地。我们已经知道，英国备战经济使消费品的价格飞涨、人民生活日益恶化的事实，而在同时，英国大资本家们的利润，却在增加着。仅在一九五○年一年内，英国豪富们的利润就比一九四九年增加了百分之二十。
    英美帝国主义间的关系，和美国垄断资本家们今天左右整个资本主义世界的事实，不说明别的，而是说明资本主义世界的削弱和危机的加深，说明帝国主义的日益走近坟墓。强大的和平民主阵营国家的人民，是与要求摆脱华尔街束缚的英国人民的利益是一致的。战争贩子们向英国人民散布谣言说：“苏联军队在六十小时内就可以打到英伦海峡的对岸！……”。我看到很多人在英国报纸的读者来信栏内这样发问道：“既然红军可以一举打到英国的边缘，何以至今还未打来，而听任英美备战呢？”英国人民很清楚地知道苏联是爱好和平的。在英国，很多各阶层有头脑的人士已经发出了警告：如果英国敢于跟着美国作新的战争冒险，那首先就是大英帝国反动资产阶级的覆没！
