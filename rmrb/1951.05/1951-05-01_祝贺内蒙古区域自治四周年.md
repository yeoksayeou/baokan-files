　　Congratulations on the Fourth Anniversary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    National regional autonomy is an important policy for resolving domestic ethnic issues in China. It began in Inner Mongolia four years ago. After four years of construction, the Inner Mongolian people are showing a thriving atmosphere in politics, economy, and culture. Replacing the old ethnic oppression, a new relationship of ethnic equality, friendship, unity, mutual assistance, and common development has been established among all ethnic groups.
    Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, in addition to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the ethnic autonomous regions already established include the Mongolian areas of the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League in Suiyuan Province, the Alxa Banner and Ejin Banner in Ningxia Province, and Subei in Gansu Province; the Tibetan areas in the eastern part of Xikang Province, Xiahe, Zhuoni, Yongdeng Tianzhu, Xigu Wuping, and Pingwu in northern Sichuan in Gansu Province; the Dongxiang ethnic area in the Linxia sub-district of Gansu Province; the Hongmao Magu Yi ethnic area in Xichang County, Xikang Province; and the Kaili Miao ethnic area in Lushan County, Guizhou Province. Similar to the situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, since the establishment of autonomous regional people's governments in these areas, local ethnic groups have shown greater love for Chairman Mao and greater support and trust in the People's Government. Ethnic consciousness and the enthusiasm of the people for construction have greatly increased, and the unity among the people of all ethnic groups and the various construction works in the region have taken a step forward. This proves that the implementation of national regional autonomy is indeed the most suitable and reasonable policy for resolving domestic ethnic issues in China.
    However, in the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy, some people, holding the idea of ​​being afraid of trouble, or fearing that the implementation of regional autonomy would affect ethnic unity, or demanding excessively high conditions for the implementation of regional autonomy, have delayed the implementation of this work. The implementation of regional autonomy is indeed an arduous working process; however, according to the experience of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other autonomous regions, national regional autonomy is the central link in promoting various tasks in ethnic regions, and it is by no means another "burden" outside of various tasks. The form of government of regional autonomy is the form of government that is easiest for all ethnic groups to understand and feel closest to. Therefore, after the implementation of regional autonomy, it does not separate ethnic unity, but strengthens ethnic unity; local ethnic groups feel even more the need for the leadership of the People's Government and the assistance of Han ethnic cadres. The implementation of regional autonomy does require certain conditions, but the promotion of regional autonomy promotes the generation or maturity of these conditions; demanding excessively high conditions is not appropriate, and it will lead to losses in the work.
    Since the Government Administration Council promulgated several decisions on ethnic affairs, people's governments at all levels and ethnic work cadres in various places have paid attention to the implementation of national regional autonomy. This is a very good thing. Since liberation, we have had some working foundation in various ethnic regions, and we have established an excellent model like the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in front of us. In the future, we must resolutely and correctly implement the policy of national regional autonomy in the Common Program and the relevant decisions of the Government Administration Council, and strive for the unity and development of all ethnic groups.

### 祝贺内蒙古区域自治四周年

　　祝贺内蒙古区域自治四周年
    民族区域自治，是解决中国国内民族问题的重要政策，它于四年前即在内蒙古开始实行。经过了四年建设的内蒙古民族，他们在政治、经济、文化各方面，都呈现欣欣向荣的气象。代替旧的民族压迫关系，各民族之间建立了民族平等、友爱团结、互相帮助、共同发展的新关系。
    自中央人民政府成立以来，已经建立的民族自治区，除内蒙古自治区外，绥远省伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟、宁夏省阿拉善旗和额济纳旗、甘肃省肃北等地的蒙族区，西康省东部地区、甘肃省夏河、卓尼、永登天祝、西固武坪、川北平武等地的藏族区，甘肃省临夏分区的东乡族区，西康省西昌县红毛麻姑彝族区，贵州省炉山县凯里苗族区，也都先后实行了民族区域自治。和内蒙古自治区的情况一样，这些地区自从建立自治区人民政府之后，当地民族更加爱戴毛主席，更加拥护和信任人民政府，民族觉悟和人民建设的积极性大为提高，各民族人民之间的团结和地方的各项建设工作都前进了一步。这就证明了：实行民族区域自治的确是解决中国国内民族问题最适宜最合理的政策。
    但是，在执行民族区域自治政策当中，曾有人抱着怕麻烦的想法，或者害怕因为实行区域自治反而影响民族团结，或者对于实行区域自治的条件要求过高，因而拖延了这一工作的推行。实行区域自治的确是一个艰巨的工作过程；但是，根据内蒙古自治区和其它自治区的经验，民族区域自治，是推动民族地区各项工作的中心环节，决不是各项工作以外的另一种“负担”。区域自治的政权形式，是各民族最容易了解和最感到亲切的政权形式。因此，实行区域自治之后，不是分离了民族的团结，而是更加强了民族的团结；当地民族更感到需要人民政府的领导，需要汉民族干部的帮助。实行区域自治固然要求一定的条件，但在推行区域自治工作中就促进了这些条件的产生或成熟；对条件的要求过高是不适宜的，它将招致工作的损失。
    自从政务院公布关于民族事务的几项决定之后，各级人民政府和各地民族工作干部对实行民族区域自治这一工作已经重视起来了，这是很好的事情。解放以来，我们在各民族地区已有了一些工作基础，在我们面前，又树立了像内蒙古自治区这样优秀的榜样，今后，我们必须坚决而正确地推行共同纲领中的民族区域自治政策和政务院的有关决定，为各民族的团结和发展而奋斗。
