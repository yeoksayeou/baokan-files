　　Spanish Workers' Strike Struggle
    The 300,000 workers in the northern Spanish industrial centers of Bilbao and San Sebastián, as well as in the provinces of Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, launched a large-scale strike on April 23 to protest rising living costs and demand a 50 percent wage increase. This is another powerful demonstration by Spanish workers against the Franco fascist regime, following the general strike of 300,000 workers in Barcelona in mid-March, and a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialism, which is plotting to turn Spain into a base for aggressive war.

    In March of this year, 300,000 workers in Barcelona held a general strike to protest the high cost of living. The wave of strikes spread to cities surrounding Barcelona, gaining widespread sympathy and support from the Spanish people and people around the world. The heroic actions of the Barcelona workers not only frightened the executioner Franco, but also greatly shook U.S. imperialism. Franco dispatched military police to brutally suppress the strike, and the United States sent planes in an attempt to intimidate the workers. But this only made the Spanish people, who have a glorious tradition of struggle, even more angry. The strike of the Barcelona workers immediately developed into a movement of the Spanish people against the Franco regime, thus shaking Franco's fascist rule since 1939. The spirit of the Spanish people fighting for freedom and justice has reappeared today.

    Since Franco seized power in Spain with the help of Hitler and Mussolini, he has been implementing an anti-people fascist rule. After World War II, he became the darling of U.S. imperialists, who inherited Hitler's fascist mantle. Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, Franco has been pursuing a policy of frenzied arms expansion and war preparations, attempting to turn Spain into a bridgehead for the United States in Europe against the Soviet Union. As a result of following the United States in implementing a policy of war preparations, Spain's military expenditure in 1950 accounted for 75 percent of the total budget, while the expenditure on developing agriculture accounted for only 1 percent.

    Franco's reactionary rule and war preparations have brought the Spanish people into an abyss of suffering. The inevitable result of spending huge amounts of military expenditure is inflation. In May 1950, the amount of currency in circulation in Spain was 27.311 billion pesetas (Spanish currency unit), and by the end of 1950 it had reached 35 billion pesetas, an increase of nearly a quarter. Under these circumstances, people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. From 1929 to 1951, the cost of living index increased more than tenfold, while the average wage of industrial workers only increased by 300 to 700 pesetas.

    At the same time, the number of unemployed is also increasing dramatically. At the beginning of 1950, there were 500,000 unemployed industrial workers and more than 3.1 million unemployed agricultural workers.

    Meanwhile, U.S. imperialism is expanding military bases in Spain. More than one hundred airfields have been built and expanded in the Balearic Islands, Spanish Morocco, and the Canary Islands; the construction of 43 Spanish seaports is underway along the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean coast. These airfields and ports are for U.S. use.

    In terms of supplying the United States with cannon fodder for war, Franco has also shown shameless slavish obedience to U.S. imperialism. Franco's General Staff has formulated a plan to mobilize one million people within three days. Franco's generals even boasted that Spain could supply U.S. imperialism with 44 divisions of troops.

    However, Franco's criminal acts are not without obstacles. The general strike of the Barcelona workers and the general strike of 300,000 workers in northern Spain this time fully demonstrate the determination of the Spanish people not to be enslaved and not to be cannon fodder for imperialist wars. The heroic actions of the Spanish workers have seriously undermined the U.S. war preparations conspiracy and Franco's fascist rule, and have infinitely encouraged the Spanish people's confidence in fighting for freedom and independence.

### 西班牙工人的罢工斗争

　　西班牙工人的罢工斗争
    西班牙北部工业中心毕尔巴鄂城、圣塞巴斯提安城和维兹加雅及吉普斯柯亚两省的三十万工人，为了抗议生活费上涨，要求增加工资百分之五十，于四月二十三日举行大罢工。这是西班牙工人继三月中旬巴塞罗那三十万工人大罢工后，对佛朗哥法西斯政权的又一次强大示威，也是对正在阴谋把西班牙变成侵略战争基地的美帝国主义的一个有力打击。
    今年三月间，巴塞罗那三十万工人，为抗议生活费的高涨举行了总罢工，罢工的浪潮扩展到巴塞罗那周围的城市，得到西班牙人民以及全世界人民的广泛同情与支持。巴塞罗那工人的英勇行为不仅使刽子手佛朗哥胆战心惊，而且也大大地震动了美帝国主义。佛朗哥曾出动军警残酷镇压，美国也派了飞机妄图恫吓。但这只有使有着光荣斗争传统的西班牙人民更加愤怒。巴塞罗那工人的罢工立刻发展成为西班牙人民反对佛朗哥政权的运动，因而动摇了自一九三九年以来的佛朗哥的法西斯统治。西班牙人民为自由与正义而斗争的精神又重现于今日。
    自从佛朗哥在希特勒和墨索里尼的帮助下攫得了西班牙政权后，他就一直实行着反人民的法西斯统治。第二次世界大战后，他又成了继承希特勒法西斯衣钵的美帝国主义者的宠儿。在美帝国主义的指使下，佛朗哥执行着疯狂的扩军备战政策，企图把西班牙变为美国在欧洲的反苏的桥头堡。由于追随美国执行备战政策的结果，西班牙一九五○年度的军事支出在全部预算中竟占了百分之七十五，而用在发展农业上的费用只占百分之一。
    佛朗哥的反动统治与备战政策，把西班牙人民带进了痛苦的深渊。支出巨额军费的必然结果，就是通货膨胀。在一九五○年五月，西班牙货币流通量为二百七十三亿一千一百万比塞大（西班牙货币单位名）而到了一九五○年底竟达三百五十亿比塞大，增加了将近四分之一。在这种情形下，人民生活就日益艰苦。由一九二九年至一九五一年之间，生活指数上涨了十倍以上，而产业工人的平均工资仅增加了三百至七百比塞大。
    同时，失业人数也在剧烈增加。在一九五○年年初有五十万工业工人失业，三百一十余万农业工人失业。
    与此同时，美帝国主义正在西班牙扩建军事基地。在巴利阿利群岛、西属摩洛哥和加那列群岛已修建和扩展了一百个以上的飞机场；在大西洋沿岸、地中海沿岸等地西班牙四十三个海港的修建工作正在进行中。这些飞机场和港口都是供美国使用的。
    在供给美国战争炮灰方面，佛朗哥也向美帝国主义表示了无耻的奴性遵从。佛朗哥的参谋总部已制订了三天内动员一百万人的计划。佛朗哥的将军们还吹嘘着说：西班牙可以供给美帝国主义四十四个师的军队。
    但是佛朗哥这种罪恶行为并不是毫无阻碍的，巴塞罗那工人的大罢工以及这次西班牙北部各地三十万工人的大罢工都充分表现了西班牙人民不甘受奴役、不愿当帝国主义战争炮灰的决心。西班牙工人的英勇行动，严重地打击了美国的备战阴谋和佛朗哥的法西斯统治，并无限地鼓舞着西班牙人民为自由与独立而斗争的信心。
