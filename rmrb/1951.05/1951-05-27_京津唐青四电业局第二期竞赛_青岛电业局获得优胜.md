　　The second phase of the safe power supply competition among the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Qingdao Electric Power Bureaus, which began on January 1st of this year, concluded at the end of March, with the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau emerging as the winner. All bureaus exceeded their safe power supply targets in the second phase of the competition, with Qingdao Bureau exceeding its target by the largest margin of 65.2%, and Tangshan Bureau exceeding its target by the smallest margin of 18.84%. At the victory celebration for the second phase of the competition, held by all employees of the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau and representatives from the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan Bureaus in Qingdao on April 21st, Guo Youlin, a representative of the Electric Power General Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the China Electrical Workers' Union, presented the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau with a red flag.

　　The main reasons for the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau's victory are:

　　First, the trade union committee was able to provide in-depth leadership and promptly identify and resolve problems. After the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau won the first phase of the competition, the employees of the Qingdao Electric Power Bureau had momentarily lost confidence and had widely developed a “relying on fate” mentality, believing that power supply accidents were mostly caused by objective reasons and were difficult to overcome. The trade union committee immediately addressed this mentality by analyzing the causes and nature of the accidents that occurred in the first phase of the competition, explaining that these accidents could be completely overcome through effort, thereby enhancing their confidence in eliminating accidents.

　　Second, the active efforts of all employees in the Power Supply Section, the main department responsible for ensuring safe power supply, as well as the active cooperation of other departments. Regardless of whether they were at work or on their own time, the employees of the Power Supply Section were able to discover and eliminate hidden potential accidents at any time and place. During the competition, the employees of the Line Division intensified line patrols and cleaning; the employees of the Dispatch Division carefully managed dispatching, helped to shorten power outage times due to faults, and constantly paid attention to line load and power outage operation methods; all substations also ensured that no substation accidents occurred; and the Business Section also strengthened user management and after-hours inspections to prevent electricity theft.

　　Third, the trade union committee organized competitions among various departments and groups within the factory and, on behalf of all employees, signed a collective contract with the administrative side, enabling the labor enthusiasm of all employees to be constantly maintained.

　　Fourth, the close cooperation of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the administration, and the trade union within the bureau. The Party branch not only provided the trade union with assistance at any time, but also convened a branch general meeting, calling on every Party member to unite the masses and actively participate in the competition. The administrative side also provided strong support to the trade union.

### 京津唐青四电业局第二期竞赛  青岛电业局获得优胜

　　京津唐青四电业局第二期竞赛
    青岛电业局获得优胜
    从今年一月一日开始的北京、天津、唐山、青岛四个电业局间的第二期安全供电竞赛，已在三月底结束，青岛电业局获得优胜。各局在第二期竞赛中都超额完成了安全供电任务，超额最多的青岛局超过百分之六十五点二，超额最少的唐山局也超过百分之十八点八四。在四月二十一日青岛电业局全体职工和北京、天津、唐山三局的职工代表在青岛举行第二期竞赛胜利联欢大会上，中央人民政府燃料工业部电业总局、中国电业工会全国委员会代表郭有麟曾授给青岛电业局红旗一面。
    青岛电业局获得优胜的主要原因是：
    第一、是该局工会委员会能够深入领导，及时发现问题与解决问题。当第一期竞赛优胜为唐山电业局获得后，青岛电业局职工曾一度失去信心，普遍地产生了一种“靠天”思想，认为供电事故多由客观原因造成，很难克服。工会委员会即针对这种思想情况，分析第一期竞赛中发生事故的原因和性质，说明这些事故是完全可以努力克服的，提高了他们消灭事故的信心。
    第二、是保证安全供电的主要部门——供电科全体职工的积极努力，以及其他各部门的积极配合。供电科职工不论在工作或休息时间，都能随时随地发掘和消灭隐形事故。在竞赛中，线路股职工加紧巡查清扫线路；调度股职工慎重调度，协助缩短故障的停电时间，并经常注意线路负载和停电操作方法；各变电所也保证了未出任何变电事故；营业科也加强了用户管理和业余检查窃电工作。
    第三、是工会委员会在厂内各部门和小组之间组织了竞赛，并代表全体职工与行政方面订立了集体合同，使全体职工的劳动积极性得以经常保持。
    第四、是该局中国共产党支部、行政和工会的紧密配合。党支部不仅随时给工会以帮助，并曾召开支部大会，号召每一党员都要团结群众，积极参加竞赛。行政方面也予工会以大力支持。
