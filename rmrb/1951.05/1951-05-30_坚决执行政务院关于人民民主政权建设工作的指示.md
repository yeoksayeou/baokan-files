　　Resolutely Implement the State Council's Instructions on the Work of Building People's Democratic Power
    Xie Juezai
    The State Council issued "Instructions on the Work of Building People's Democratic Power" on April 24th, requiring people's governments at all levels to comply and implement them. Furthermore, the people's government civil affairs departments of all major administrative regions and centrally-administered municipalities and provinces are required to report the implementation of the various tasks within the instructions to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government in two installments, at the end of May and the end of October this year.

    The May report can only reflect the current status of the power construction work in various regions; the October report requires people's governments at all levels to have planned and actively implement the State Council's instructions in these five months, with further achievements and gains.

    Reporting such work twice a year should not only be done this year but also in the future.

    Over the past year, the achievements in the construction of people's democratic power have been significant. The people have already risen or are rising and are mastering their own destiny through the People's Representative Conferences. However, in some places, "the phenomenon of neglecting the work of power construction still exists." They have not deeply understood that "'the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power.' The revolution must first overthrow the reactionary regime, and then build the people's new regime on the ruins of the shattered old regime, vigorously lead the people to consolidate the victory of the revolution, that is, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, thereby guaranteeing the improvement of the country and the people's economic undertakings and their smooth development."

    Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi emphatically pointed out at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing:

    "The People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress system are the basic systems of our country, the best and most basic organizational forms of the people's democratic power. Our country is a country of the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress system... The people of all levels of the people's governments, all democratic parties, and all democratic classes should, in accordance with the Common Program and the laws and decrees promulgated by the Central People's Government, actively and diligently establish the People's Representative Conferences at all levels practically and not just formally, according to the actual possible situation in each place, so that they can more broadly and closely link the people's masses of all democratic classes politically and organizationally, and gradually improve them in organizational form, so that the current People's Representative Conferences at all levels can gradually transition to People's Congresses at all levels in the near future - People's Congresses that are fully capable of representing the people in exercising power at all levels. In this way, we can rely on the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress, a system with great effectiveness, to closely unite the people of the whole country around the people's governments at all levels, and under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, form a strong unified force to fulfill the construction tasks and defense tasks that our people urgently need to fulfill..."

    Saying that it is the "basic system of the country," and the "basic organizational form," means that our country has various systems, but the system of the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress is fundamental. If the basic system is not built well, other systems will lack leadership and guarantee. Our country has various organizations, but the organization of the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress is fundamental. If the basic organization is not built well, other organizations will be difficult to develop because they have nothing to rely on. The construction of the People's Republic of China relies on this basic system and basic organizational form. The broad masses of the people strongly support this basic system and basic organizational form. They feel that with this, they have truly turned themselves over and are in control of their own destiny. However, some government workers have adopted a neglectful attitude towards this basic system and basic organizational form, failing to seize it tightly and rely on the enthusiasm of the masses in a timely manner, and actively carry out this work, thus making the development of power construction work far behind the demands and needs of the broad masses of the people.

    Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said:

    "Some government workers are reluctant to convene People's Representative Conferences. They are accustomed to a few people doing everything, and are not accustomed to consulting with the people's representatives on matters. They think that convening People's Representative Conferences is 'too troublesome.' They use the excuse that 'work is too busy,' or the excuse that 'there is nothing to do,' and do not convene People's Representative Conferences. For these people, the higher authorities must urge them. Otherwise, they will not convene People's Representative Conferences on time. Those who do not convene People's Representative Conferences on time without sufficient reason should be criticized or even punished... People's Representative Conferences at all levels should be convened on schedule regardless of whether there is anything to do or not. 'Too much work' should be convened even more in order to mobilize more people and unite the activists among the people to do these so-called too much work separately... In all normal circumstances, we must abide by this important system of our country and convene People's Representative Conferences at all levels on schedule..."

    Many facts prove that wherever the People's Representative Conferences are convened and convened well, the people grasp the policies, treat the government's work as their own, and work enthusiastically. They warmly accept the government's leadership and can provide many opinions to enrich the government's leadership. The execution of the work not only yields unexpected achievements but also rarely goes wrong. These facts have taught many cadres a lesson. Some of them said, "This kind of meeting was held too late"; "Things are much easier to handle through the representative meeting!" Some said, "The people have so many ideas!" Others said, "I didn't expect them to be so bold!" (It's not that the people are bold, but that those who are unwilling to consult with the people's representatives are bold!)

    Although this is the case, the "habit of a few people doing everything, and not being accustomed to consulting with the people's representatives on matters" cannot be changed by one or two experiences; the people and the people's representatives are also not accustomed to blaming the government for not convening People's Representative Conferences? Why not report on a certain important work that has been done and request a review; why not submit a certain major work that is about to be done for discussion? They are not even accustomed to conducting reviews and criticisms at the representative meetings by knowing everything and saying everything. Therefore, "the higher authorities must urge them."

    Moreover, some government workers do not fail to recognize this basic system and basic organizational form, nor do they fail to know the benefits of consulting with the people's representatives, but because of some inertia, they have not summarized their work in a timely manner and cannot put forward reports. They know that reporting to the representative meeting must be practical and profound, otherwise they will be criticized, which is of course good; but as a result, the representative meeting is delayed, the old work is not reviewed, and the new work comes again. Without the active help of the people, the work becomes more and more difficult to develop, and the people become more and more dissatisfied with the government that "does everything." There are also some who are afraid of being criticized because their work has shortcomings, so they do not convene meetings, or intentionally avoid or suppress criticism at the meetings, which is even more wrong. Therefore, "the higher authorities must urge them."

    The first six items of the Central People's Government State Council's instructions should be followed by people's governments at all levels, and no neglect is allowed. Regarding the convening of People's Representative Conferences at all levels and the committees of people's governments at all levels and their administrative meetings, except for the People's Representative Conferences of large cities and counties, based on the experience of the past year, large cities must hold at least three meetings a year, and counties must hold at least two meetings a year, others must also be convened on schedule in accordance with the regulations. Here, special attention should be paid to the meetings of the committees of people's governments at all levels and their administrative meetings. The functions and powers of the committees of people's governments at all levels are to implement the resolutions and orders of the higher-level people's governments, and to implement the resolutions entrusted by the People's Representative Conferences (People's Congresses) at the same level, and other prescribed tasks. It is the organ for the people to exercise state power. If meetings are not held on schedule, the functions and powers prescribed in the organizational rules will not be realized, and therefore it will be impossible to gather collective wisdom and make various opinions form a democratic collective leadership through meetings. The members of the people's governments at all levels all have concurrent positions and do not all live in one place. It is difficult to convene the committees. The organizational rules have taken this into consideration and stipulate that a quorum of more than half of the members can be held. The committees of the major administrative regions are stipulated to be convened once every three months, which is longer than the Central People's Government Committee meeting, which is convened once every two months. Therefore, the State Council's instructions: "It is completely correct to establish a regular meeting system in accordance with the provisions of the organizational rules of the people's governments at all levels." The same is true for administrative meetings. This work is included in the seventh item of the instruction, inspection and reporting, and do not forget: it must be written in future reports.

    Secondly, what needs to be brought up is that the National Civil Affairs Conference last year stipulated that the People's Representative Conference is the main system for building power at present; doing a good job in the county People's Representative Conference is the main work of the civil affairs departments at all levels. It also pointed out: "The civil affairs departments of the people's governments of all provinces and regions should attach importance to the establishment of the county-level people's democratic system. If the county is done well, it will be easier to do well in the districts and townships below the county. Each province should send capable personnel to select several counties to do typical experiments, and use the achievements and experience gained to promote it to other counties." Since the meeting, almost all of the more than 2,000 counties across the country have convened People's Representative Conferences, and some have convened them multiple times, but not many are acting on behalf of the functions and powers of the People's Congress. According to recent statistics, only 90 have acted on behalf of the functions and powers of the People's Congress, equivalent to only five banners of the county. Now the people not only have considerable organization and awareness but also have preliminary democratic experience. Therefore, "People's Representative Conferences of counties and cities that have not yet acted on behalf of the functions and powers of the People's Congress should actively create conditions so as to quickly act on behalf of the functions and powers of the People's Congress." Saying "quickly act on behalf of" means not allowing further delay; saying "actively create conditions" means not allowing neglect or perfunctorily striving for the numbers of "acting on behalf of the functions and powers of the People's Congress."

    Third, "In areas where land reform has been completed, the administrative divisions of districts and townships (administrative villages) should be adjusted as appropriate to reduce the administrative scope of districts and townships in order to facilitate the people's management of power... Fully develop the role of grassroots organizations of the people's power," which is also very important. Grassroots political power organizations are where the people directly exercise power and are the great and widespread foundation of state power. The original district and township divisions of our provinces, some were too large, with some districts having a population of 70,000 to 80,000, and some townships having a population of 10,000 to 20,000, and some were too small, with some townships (administrative villages) only having a small village, which were not suitable for establishing grassroots political power. At the same time, there is too much work for districts and townships, especially townships. Some places are already adjusting, and their grassroots political power is being established. In order to adapt to the needs of the people to manage and build good grassroots political power, the work mentioned in the instructions must be done quickly.

    Regarding the convening of People's Representative Conferences in cities with a population of more than 100,000, the establishment of district people's governments; the issue of People's Representative Conferences should review government work and discuss major work issues; the issue of promoting national regional autonomy; I will not say much here. In short, people's governments at all levels are required to resolutely and carefully implement them.

    The last item of the instructions is for people's governments at all levels to inspect, that is, have the first six items been done? Were they done well or not? What methods of urging and guidance have been taken? They should "report to the higher authorities regularly" and "report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government regularly."

    Those who do not do so or do not do it well, in the words of Vice Chairman Liu, "should be criticized or even punished." Naturally, those who do it well have consolidated the victory of the people's revolution, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, thereby guaranteeing the development of the country, the people's economic undertakings, and the defense undertakings; they have made great contributions to the people and should be supported and rewarded by the people.

　　坚决执行政务院关于人民民主政权建设工作的指示
    谢觉哉
    政务院四月二十四日发出“关于人民民主政权建设工作的指示”，要各级人民政府遵照执行。并要各大行政区，中央直属省、市人民政府民政部门，将指示内各项工作执行的情况，于今年五月底、十月底分两次报告中央人民政府内务部。
    五月底的报告，只能反映各地政权建设工作的现况；十月底的报告，则要求各级人民政府，在这五个月里有计划地并且积极地执行政务院的指示，有进一步的成绩收获。
    一年作两次这样工作的报告，不只今年应如此，以后也应如此。
    一年多来，人民民主政权建设工作成绩是很大的，人民已经或正在起来，通过人民代表会议掌握着自己的命运。但是，有些地方“对政权建设工作的忽视现象仍然存在”，他们还没深刻了解“‘革命的根本问题是政权问题’。革命首先是要打倒反动政权，接着就在被粉碎的旧政权的废墟上建设人民的新政权，大力领导人民巩固革命的胜利，亦即巩固人民民主专政，从而保障国家和人民经济事业的改进及其顺利的发展。”
    刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上着重地指出：
    “人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，是我们国家的基本制度，是人民民主政权的最好的基本的组织形式。我们的国家就是人民代表会议与人民代表大会制的国家。……各级人民政府，各民主党派，各民主阶级的人民，都应该依据共同纲领和中央人民政府颁布的法令，按照各个地方实际可能的情况，积极地努力地把各级人民代表会议实际地而不只是形式地建立起来，使它在政治上和组织上更广大更密切地联系各民主阶级的人民群众，在组织形式上也逐步地使它完备起来，使目前的各级人民代表会议能够在最近几年内逐步地过渡为各级人民代表大会——完全能够代表人民行使各级政权的人民代表大会。这样，就能依靠人民代表会议与人民代表大会这一个有伟大功效的制度，把全国人民紧密地团结在各级人民政府的周围，在中央人民政府的统一领导之下，形成为一个强大的统一的力量，去履行我们全国人民迫切需要履行的建设任务和国防任务。……”
    说是“国家的基本制度”，“基本的组织形式”，就是说：我们国家有各样的制度，而人民代表会议和人民代表大会的制度则是基本的，基本的制度没建设好，其他的制度就缺乏领导与保障。我们的国家有各样的组织，而人民代表会议和人民代表大会的组织则是基本的，基本的组织没建设好，其他的组织也将因无所附丽而难于发扬。中华人民共和国的建设，是依靠这个基本制度与基本组织形式的。广大人民对于这个基本制度与基本组织形式，非常拥护，他们感到有了这个，才是真正的翻了身，才是自己掌握了自己的命运。然而，有些政府工作人员，对这一基本制度和基本组织形式，却采取了忽视态度，没有及时地紧紧抓住并依靠群众的积极性，积极地开展这一工作，因而使得政权建设工作的开展，还远赶不上广大人民的要求和需要。
    刘少奇副主席说：
    “有些政府工作人员是不大愿意召开人民代表会议的，他们习惯于少数人包办一切，而不习惯于和人民的代表商量办事，他们认为召开人民代表会议‘太麻烦’，他们借口‘工作太忙’，或又借口‘没有事’，而不召开人民代表会议。对于这些人，必须由上级加以督促。否则，他们就不按规定时间召开人民代表会议。对于没有充分理由而不按规定时间召开人民代表会议者，应给以批评以至处分。……各级人民代表会议不论有事无事都应按期召开，‘工作太多’更应召开，以便动员更多的人民和团结人民中的积极分子把这些所谓太多的工作分头地去做好。……在一切通常的情况下，均必须遵守我们国家这项重要的制度，按期召开各级人民代表会议。……”
    许多事实证明：凡是召开了人民代表会议且开的好的，人民掌握了政策，把政府的工作当做自己的工作，起劲地干，他们热烈接受政府的领导，并能提供很多意见，充实政府的领导；工作的执行，不仅有出人意料的成绩，而且很少出偏差。这些事实，教训了不少干部，他们有的说：“这样的会，开得太迟了”；“通过代表会，事情好办多了！”有的说：“老百姓的办法真多！”也有的说：“想不到他们这样大胆！”（不是人民大胆，而应是不肯和人民的代表商量办事的人大胆！）
    虽然如此，“习惯于少数人包办一切，而不习惯于和人民的代表商量办事”的某些工作人员，不是一次二次的经验所能改变的；人民及人民代表也还不习惯于责备政府为什不召开人民代表会议？为什不把已做的某项重要工作提出报告，请求审查；为什不把将做的某项重大工作提交讨论？甚至还不习惯于在代表会议上知无不言，言无不尽地进行审查与批评。因此“必须由上级加以督促”。
    还有，一些政府工作人员，对这一基本制度与基本组织形式，不是不认识，不是不知道和人民代表商量办事的好处，而因为有某种惰性，没有及时总结工作，提不出报告。他们知道向代表会议做报告必须切实、深刻，否则要挨批评，这当然是好的；而因此延不召开代表会议，旧的工作未检讨，新的工作又来了，得不到人民的积极帮助，工作越做越展不开，人民对于“包办”工作的政府也越不满意。还有一些因为工作有缺点，怕挨批评，因而不召开会议，或在会议上有意避免或压制批评，这更是不对。所以“必须由上级加以督促”。
    中央人民政府政务院指示的前六项，要各级人民政府照着做，不许有任何忽视。关于召开各级人民代表会议和各级人民政府委员会及其行政会议，除大城市和县人民代表会议，依据一年来的经验，大城市每年至少须开会三次，县至少须开会二次外，其他亦须依照规定按期召开。这里应特别提起注意的为各级人民政府委员会会议及其行政会议。各级人民政府委员会的职权，为执行上级人民政府的决议和命令，和实施同级人民代表会议（人民代表大会）所交付的决议，及其他规定的任务。它是人民行使国家政权的机关，假如不按期开会，将使组织通则上规定的职权无由实现，因而就无法集思广益，使各方面的意见通过会议，形成民主的集体领导。各级人民政府的委员，都有兼职，不都住在一处，委员会的召开是有困难的，组织通则曾顾到了，规定有过半数委员出席即可开会，大行政区的委员会，则规定三个月召开一次，比中央人民政府委员会会议两个月召集一次还长。因此，政务院指示：“应按照各级人民政府组织通则的规定，建立经常的会议制度是完全正确的。”行政会议，也是一样。这一工作，是包括在指示的第七项检查与报告之内的，不要忘记：在将来的报告里必须写上。
    其次，要提出说说的，是县、市各界人民代表会议，去年全国民政会议规定：人民代表会议为现时建政的主要制度；搞好县人民代表会议为各级民政部门的主要工作。并指出：“各省区人民政府的民政部门要重视县级人民民主制度的建立。县做好了，县以下的区、乡才易于做好，各省应派得力人员选择几个县做典型试验，而以取得的成绩经验，推之于其他县”。会议以来，全国二千多个县，差不多都召开了人民代表会议，有的已开了多次，但代行人民代表大会职权的尚不很多，据最近统计已代行人民代表大会职权的只九十个，相当于县的旗只五个。现在人民群众不但已经有了相当的组织和觉悟并且有了初步的民主的经验。因此“凡尚未代行人民代表大会职权的县、市各界人民代表会议，应积极创造条件，以便迅速代行人民代表大会的职权。”说“迅速代行”，即是不许再拖延；说“积极创造条件”，即是不许忽视或马马虎虎地只争取“代行人民代表大会职权”的数字。
    第三，“已完成土地改革的地区，应酌量调整区、乡（行政村）行政区划，缩小区、乡行政范围，以便利人民管理政权……充分发挥人民政权的基层组织的作用，”这也是非常重要的。基层政权组织，是人民直接行使权力的地方，是国家政权伟大而又普遍的基础。我国各省原来的区乡区划，有的太大，区有辖人口至七八万，乡亦有辖人口至一、二万的，有的又太小，有仅仅辖一个不大的村庄的乡（行政村），都不适宜于建立基层政权。同时给区乡尤其是乡的工作又太多。现有些地方已在调整，其基层政权也正在建立。为着适应人民管理和建设好基层政权的需要，必须把指示上所提的工作迅速作好。
    关于十万人口以上的市召开人民代表会议，成立区人民政府问题；人民代表会议应审查政府工作与讨论重大工作问题；推行民族区域自治问题；我在这里不多说了。总之，要求各级人民政府必须坚决与注意的执行。
    指示的最后一项是要各级人民政府检查，即前六项都做了没有？做得好或不好？曾经采取了一些什么督促与指导的方法？要“定期报告上级”及“定期报告中央人民政府内务部”。
    不这样办或办得不好的，照刘副主席的话：“应给以批评以至处分”。自然，办得好的，是巩固了人民革命的胜利，巩固了人民民主专政，从而保障了国家与人民经济事业与国防事业的发展；是对人民有大功，应该得到人民的拥戴与奖励。
