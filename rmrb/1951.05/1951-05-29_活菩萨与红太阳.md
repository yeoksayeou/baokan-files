　　Living Buddha and Red Sun
　　By Our Special Correspondent Ye Juesun
　　In the six counties of Songpan, Maogong, Li County, Mao County, Wenchuan, and Jinghua in the Western Sichuan Administrative Region, 80 percent of the population consists of Tibetan, Hui, and Qiang ethnic groups. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries used various means to sow discord and carry out plunder and robbery among these ethnic groups, causing these minority ethnic groups to live a primitive life like animals. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, these minority ethnic groups have shaken off the shackles of reactionary rule and have begun to participate in the great construction of New China with free and equal political status.
　　During the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, taking the situation in the areas where minority ethnic groups of Mao County and Li County lived together as an example, land for planting opium accounted for one-third of all cultivated land, and the number of people who smoked opium accounted for about eight or nine out of ten adults. Moreover, the opium they planted was plundered by the lackeys of the Chiang bandit gang and sold for profit every time it matured. The minority ethnic brothers were so poor that they had no food to eat. In addition to poverty and hunger, there were also bandits such as Chen Jianhou and Guo Zinan in these areas who often robbed homes. In the bitterly cold Wolong Township of Wenchuan, where Tibetans lived, they were in a constant state of terror under the plunder of bandits. However, "bandits are certainly fierce, but their insidiousness and cunning cannot match the Kuomintang reactionary government!" said the Tibetan man Ou'erxiao. The Kuomintang reactionary government, on the one hand, used divisive tactics to cause frequent armed conflicts among the various minority ethnic groups. At the same time, it took advantage of these armed conflicts to extort gold, silver, and wealth from both sides. This is just a small fragment of the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the minority ethnic areas.
　　"Today the sun has come out!" Ou'erxiao said: "Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining into our deep mountains, so we have a chance to rise. Our minority ethnic groups compare Chairman Mao and the People's Government to 'Living Buddhas' and the 'Red Sun'." The People's Liberation Army has completely eliminated the bandits in the Jinlama (Tibetan) village. When food was scarce, the People's Government supplemented their insufficient grain and provided seeds on loan. It is no longer necessary to spend money in "lawsuits," and everyone can sit down and reason politely. The long-standing feud in Songpan that had not been resolved for thirteen years has been satisfactorily resolved after enlightenment and education. The armed conflicts in Aba, Heishui, and other places, which had resulted in more than 200 casualties, have also disappeared; both sides have been able to eliminate past estrangement through self-criticism. Places that were previously inaccessible are now open and unobstructed. Minority ethnic groups have participated in government work, with three serving as county heads or deputy county heads, nine as section chiefs or district heads, and fifty-two as other general working cadres. The democratic coalition government among the various ethnic groups has been established.
　　The local products company purchased local and specialty products such as furs, caterpillar fungus, Qiang 활, and fritillaria valued at about 400 million yuan, and supplied daily necessities such as tea, salt, oil, and cloth valued at more than 14.5 billion yuan. The People's Bank provided various loans for plowing cattle, farm implements, and rations totaling more than 120 million yuan. Over the past year, the promotion of trade has revitalized the impoverished mountainous areas. Tax revenue in the first half of 1950 was only 300 million yuan, but it increased to more than 2 billion yuan in the second half of the year. With the development of economic work, cultural work has also begun to develop. Recently, three minority ethnic schools have been established, giving children and young people the opportunity to study.
　　Because of the political liberation and the gradual improvement of their economic life, Chairman Mao in the minds of the minority ethnic groups has indeed become the "Living Buddha" and "Red Sun" that they have dreamed of for many years. The Qiang people in the Zaoling area of Mao County organized more than 1,000 people during the Spring Festival this year to go to the city to comfort the People's Liberation Army from more than 100 li away; at the same time, they also organized more than 1,000 yaks to assist the government in transporting 240,000 jin of grain over the Dajue Mountain, which is 4,000 meters above sea level, to a destination 360 li away. In the bandit suppression work, the Tibetan and Qiang people cooperated closely with the government to gradually eliminate the bandits in the Wenchuan area, causing bandit leaders such as Yang Dashan to surrender.
　　In a large building covering more than 40 mu in Xinyusha Street, Chengdu, the Southwest Nationalities College has been established. Hundreds of young people from Miao, Tibetan, Hui, Qiang, Yi, and other minority ethnic groups have been able to receive New Democratic education in the spacious and beautiful campus. The Red Sun has begun to shine on every corner of the southwestern border, bringing boundless light and happiness to the minority ethnic brothers!

　　活菩萨与红太阳
    本报特约记者  叶厥孙
    在川西行政区松潘、懋功、理县、茂县、汶川、靖化六县，有百分之八十的人口是藏、回、羌等民族。过去国民党反动派在这些民族中间，多方进行挑拨离间，搜刮抢劫，使这些少数民族一直过着极原始的牛马生活。今天，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，这些少数民族已摆脱了反动统治的枷锁，开始以自由平等的政治地位，参加新中国的伟大建设工作。
    在国民党反动统治时代，单从茂县、理县少数民族杂居区域的情况来谈，种植鸦片烟的土地，占所有耕地面积的三分之一，吸食鸦片烟的人数，约占成年人的十分之八、九。而且他们种植的鸦片，每到成熟时期，即为蒋匪帮爪牙们掠夺去贩卖谋利。而少数民族弟兄们都贫困得没有粮食吃。除了贫困、饥饿之外，在这些地区还有陈建侯、郭子南等土匪，时常打家劫舍。在藏族居住的苦寒的汶川卧龙乡一带，在土匪的掠劫下，陷于时刻都得提心吊胆的恐怖状态。可是，“土匪固然很凶，其阴险狡诈却还赶不上国民党反动政府！”藏族人欧尔孝这样说。国民党反动派政府一方面用挑拨离间手段，使各少数民族间时常发生械斗。同时，又利用这种械斗，向双方索取金银财帛。这就是国民党反动派在少数民族地区的黑暗统治的零星片断的状况。
    “今天出了太阳啦！”欧尔孝说：“毛主席像太阳，照到我们深山里，我们才有了出头的日子。我们少数民族把毛主席、人民政府比做‘活菩萨’与‘红太阳’”。解放军已把金喇嘛（藏族）村子里的土匪全部肃清。在青黄不接的时候，人民政府已补足他们不够的粮食，贷给种子。“打官司”时再也不必花钱，并且大家都还可以坐着客客气气地讲道理。在松潘十三年来未能解决的私仇悬案，经过启发教育后，已经圆满地解决。曾经死伤二百多人的阿坝黑水等地的械斗，也从此冰消；双方并且都能用自我批评的方式，打消过去的隔阂。以往互不通行的地方，今天可以畅通无阻。少数民族参加了政府工作，担任正副县长者三人，科长、区长九人，其他一般工作干部五十二人。各民族间的民主联合政府已经建立起来。
    土产公司在当地收购皮毛、虫草、羌活、平贝等约值四亿元的土产、特产，并供应了约值十四亿五千多万元的茶、盐、油、布等日用必需品，人民银行贷放耕牛、农具、口粮等各种贷款一亿二千多万元。一年来，由于贸易工作的推进，已使贫困的山区，开始活跃起来。一九五○年上半年的税收不过三亿元，而下半年即增至二十多亿元。由于经济工作的开展，文化工作也开始发展起来，最近还设立了三所少数民族学校，使儿童及青年得到了求学的机会。
    因为在政治上的得到解放，和在经济生活上一天天得到改善，少数民族心目中的毛主席，确已成为多年来朝夕梦想的“活菩萨”与“红太阳”。茂县蚤陵一带的羌族人民，在今年春节中组织了一千多人，从百余里以外，进城去慰劳解放军；同时还组织了一千多头毛牛，协助政府将二十四万斤粮食，越过拔海四千公尺的大雪山，运到三百六十里以外的目的地。在剿匪工作中，藏族、羌族人民都与政府密切配合，使汶川一带的匪徒逐步肃清，使匪首杨达山等俯首就擒。
    在成都新玉沙街一座占地四十多亩的大建筑里，已成立了西南民族学院。几百个苗、藏、回、羌、彝等少数民族的青年子弟，已能在宽广美丽的校园里，接受新民主主义的教育。红太阳已开始普照到西南边疆的每一角落，给少数民族兄弟带来了无限光明与幸福！
