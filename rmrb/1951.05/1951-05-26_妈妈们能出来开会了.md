　　Moms Can Come to Meetings Now
    Zheng Qian
    There are many residents in the Chenggen area of the Second District, Eleventh Police Station in Beijing, and almost every family has two or three children. When the police station holds mass meetings, the children often cause trouble. When mothers come to meetings, the children always follow behind them, unable to stay still for a moment, making the meeting chaotic. People without children complain, and the mothers can't concentrate on the meeting either. If they are not allowed to bring their children, some women have real difficulties and simply don't come at all. Wang Dasao from the west entrance of Xueyuan Hutong raises four children alone and rarely attends meetings. Once, Wang Dasao brought Xiao San, Xiao Bao, and Xiao Wu to a meeting. The three children kept making a fuss, and halfway through the meeting, everyone said, "Look at the mess you're making, go home and wait. We'll tell you tomorrow when we have time." Wang Dasao blushed, took the children, and left. She hasn't attended any meetings since then.
    This time, to promote the resistance against America and aid to Korea, and to ensure that every household and every person knew about it, students from the Eighth Municipal Middle School went to the Eleventh Police Station to promote it. When they discussed the work with the station chief and district and street women representatives, they suggested, "It's best not to allow children to be brought to meetings." The station chief thought for a moment and said, "I'm afraid that won't work. Banning children is the same as banning mothers from participating." The women representatives remembered that once, at a women's representatives meeting, one representative took the children out to play and brought them back after the meeting adjourned. The meeting that day was very productive. Everyone discussed it and felt that this method was very good. So it was decided that some of the younger students from the Eighth Middle School would organize a children's propaganda team to gather the children nearby to tell stories, look at picture books, and let the adults attend meetings with peace of mind. When notifying each household of the meeting this time, they all said, "Mothers are welcome to bring their children to the meeting, the more the better." Adults and children were all happy.
    On April 11th, when the gong and drums announced it, everyone came. On that day alone, the entire police station held fifty-nine group meetings, with more than seven hundred women participating. More than twenty children's meetings were also held, with a total of more than three hundred children participating, ranging from four or five years old to eleven or twelve years old. These meetings were all very successful, and the adults were able to concentrate. The children all sat in the courtyard and square, with their eyes wide open, listening to the students talk about the villain Truman, and also learned a few songs. When the adults finished the meeting, the children hugged the students' legs and wouldn't let them leave, asking, "When will there be another meeting?" Some children said, "When I grow up, I will be a volunteer soldier and fight the American devils." One mother said, "In the past, attending meetings always felt like a waste of time because the children were always making a fuss. This meeting, I really listened carefully." That day, Wang Dasao also attended the meeting, and the children were overjoyed when they returned. Xiao Bao even taught her to sing: "雄纠纠，气昂昂…" (xiong jiu jiu, qi ang ang - Valiant and spirited).
    This method is now becoming popular. The women representatives of the Eleventh Police Station want to continue to implement this method regularly.

　　妈妈们能出来开会了
    郑潜
    北京市二区十一派出所城根一带住户多，差不多谁家也有两三个孩子。派出所召开群众会，常常为孩子捣麻烦，妈妈来开会，孩子总爱跟在屁股后边，一会儿也稳不住，搅的会场乱哄哄的，没孩子的人就直抱怨 ，妈妈们也安不下心来开会。要是不准带孩子吧，有些妇女真有困难，干脆大人孩子全不来了。学院胡同西口王大嫂，一人拉扯着四个孩子，很少参加会。有一回，王大嫂带着小三、小宝、小五去开会。三个孩子一劲儿折腾，会开了半截，大家就说：“瞧你们这搅混劲儿，家去等着吧，明儿有工夫我们传话给你。”王大嫂红着脸，带起孩子就走了。从那就没参加过什么会。
    这一回宣传抗美援朝要让每一家每一人都知道，市立第八中学学生到十一派出所去宣传，他们和所长、区、街妇女代表商量工作的时候，提出：“开会最好不准带孩子。”所长想了想说：“这怕不成，禁止带孩子就等于禁止了妈妈参加。”妇女代表们想起来有一次开妇女代表会，由一个代表把孩子们领出去玩，等散会才回来，那天会开的挺踏实。大家商量了一下，觉着这办法很好，于是决定由第八中学有些年龄较小的学生组织个儿童宣传队，把孩子聚在就近讲故事，看画片、让大人安心开会。这次通知各户开会的时候，都说：“欢迎妈妈开会带孩子，越多越好。”大人、小孩全乐了。
    四月十一日那一天，敲锣打鼓一通知，人全来了。就这一天，全派出所开了五十九个片会，妇女参加的有七百多人，还开了二十多个孩子会，参加的孩子，从四、五岁到十一、二岁一共有三百多个。这些会，开的都挺好，大人精神集中。孩子也都坐在当院里，广场上，睁着大眼睛，听学生们讲坏蛋杜鲁门，还学了几个歌儿。大人散会了，孩子抱着学生们的腿不让走，问：“什么时候还开会？”有的孩子说：“我长大了当志愿军打美国鬼子去。”一位妈妈说：“过去开会总觉着工夫大，原来都是孩子吱吱呀呀闹的心烦，这会可听真了。”这天，王大嫂也参加了会，回去孩子们乐的什么似的，小宝还教她唱：“雄纠纠，气昂昂……”
    这办法现在行开了。十一派出所的妇女代表们要把这个办法经常实行下去。
