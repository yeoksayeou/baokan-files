　　【Wuhan Dispatch】 Over eight thousand people's representatives from all walks of life in Wuhan City held a rally at the Zhongshan Park Great Lawn on April 28th to celebrate the "May Day" Labor Day. Deng Zihui, Third Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, spoke at the meeting, pointing out: This year we are celebrating "May Day" Labor Day in a situation where the people of the whole country have achieved new and great victories in all aspects, but we must not be complacent. The task of national construction is very arduous. American imperialism is expanding its war of aggression; we are still under the threat of armed attack by American imperialism. Therefore, he called on the people of the entire region to enthusiastically participate in the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He further put forward four specific struggle tasks for the people of the entire Central South region: (1) Continue to carry out the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea; (2) Complete the land reform undertaking; (3) Assist the government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and consolidate the great unity of the people; (4) Do a good job in economic work, cultivate construction talents, run local undertakings, and prepare to welcome large-scale economic construction.

    【本报武汉专电】武汉市各界人民代表八千余人，四月二十八日在中山公园大草场举行庆祝“五一”劳动节大会。中共中央中南局第三书记、中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢在会上讲话，指出：今年我们是在全国人民各方面获得新的巨大胜利的情况下来庆祝“五一”劳动节，但是我们决不能自满。国家建设任务，十分繁重。美帝国主义正在扩大侵略战争；我们还处在美帝国主义武装进攻的威胁之下。因此，他号召全区人民热烈参加抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命三大运动。他并进一步为全中南区人民提出四项具体斗争任务：（一）继续开展抗美援朝爱国运动；（二）完成土地改革事业；（三）协助政府坚决镇压反革命，巩固人民大团结；（四）做好经济工作，培养建设人材，兴办地方事业，准备迎接大规模经济建设。
