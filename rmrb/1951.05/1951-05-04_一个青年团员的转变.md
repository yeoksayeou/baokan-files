　　Transformation of a Young Communist League Member
       Bai Sheng
    On the eve of the "May Fourth" Youth Day, in the Student Union office of Peking University, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, I interviewed a young man – he is one of the typical young people among the more than two thousand students of Peking University who are inheriting the glorious tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement by actively participating in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

    This young man's name is Luo Bopeng, twenty-four years old, a member of the Communist Youth League; a fourth-year student in the Physics Department of Peking University, a good student of the Mao Zedong era. He was born into a bankrupt small landlord family in Changsha, Hunan. When he was studying at the affiliated middle school of Zhejiang University in Guizhou, it was the period when the War of Resistance Against Japan was raging. Like many young people with patriotic enthusiasm, he was deceived by the Kuomintang reactionaries and joined the Youth Army at that time. However, before long, the Kuomintang reactionaries' crimes of opposing communism and the people made him realize that he had been deceived. He deserted and ran away. In the autumn of 1946, he was admitted to Peking University. During the vigorous student movement before the liberation of Beijing, he received a good education in reality, and he found a direction for advancement in his thinking and politics. But this was only the beginning of a correct understanding of reality by an intellectual youth.

    On the first "May Fourth" Youth Day after the liberation of Beijing – on the day the Chinese New Democratic Youth League was founded, he was honorably approved to join the League. To this day, he has been educated by the League for two years. Although he is gradually progressing and transforming himself, he correctly recognized how to be an excellent member of the Communist Youth League in this great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

    When the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea unfolded, Luo Bopeng, like many young League members, actively plunged into this movement. And this great patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea gave him the deepest education. In the propaganda work for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, facts proved that he was an excellent propagandist. He created various new forms of propaganda, and overcame difficulties to find ways to motivate more students to carry out propaganda work, giving play to the initiative and creativity of a Communist Youth League member. For example, when the atomic bomb caused terror in some people, he tried to interview You Mingzhe and Chu Qingzhi, who had personally experienced the atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima, Japan, and survived. He used their facts to illustrate that the atomic bomb was not to be feared. When he discovered that entertainment venues were good places for current affairs propaganda, he once mobilized many students through the organization to conduct more than forty propaganda speeches in places such as the Dahua Cinema and Tianqiao. During the propaganda in the countryside, he took the initiative to help the peasants dig soil and pull weeds before conducting propaganda, which caused a good impression among the peasants. In the popularization of astronomy, he again called on the students to appropriately link it with the propaganda of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. What surprised the students the most was that he did not affect his studies because he had done so much propaganda work, and his academic performance was relatively good.

    Before the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, Luo Bopeng had many shortcomings. He once had a relatively strong sense of individual heroism, was arrogant, did not believe in the power of the organization, and had the airs of an intellectual student, with a free and undisciplined style. That is to say, his political consciousness was not high enough. For example, when many Party members and Communist Youth League members requested to go to the Party training class last year, he was initially one of those who requested to study. But after studying for a period of time, he returned to school halfway because he could not get used to the relatively strict collective life. Another time, because he could not recognize the power of the organization, he always subjectively believed that the meeting could not solve any problems when the Communist Youth League held various meetings, and he did not actively participate. He had more considerations about his graduation issues, showing personal plans.

    Why was Luo Bopeng able to overcome so many shortcomings and transform himself into an excellent member of the Communist Youth League in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea? This is exactly what he said: "In the tide of this great patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, due to the education of reality and the education and help of the Communist Youth League, I realized the relationship between myself and the motherland, and realized the insignificance of individual strength. Everything of an individual should be for the motherland. Without the motherland, there is no individual at all. Moreover, I am a member of the Communist Youth League. The contact with the vast number of peasants during the propaganda in the countryside made me experience the simplicity and hard work of the peasants and their love for their motherland from practice. In order to commemorate the "May Fourth" Youth Day and carry out the propaganda work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in depth, I will further actively and voluntarily transform myself."

### 一个青年团员的转变

　　一个青年团员的转变
       柏生
    “五四”青年节的前夕，在“五四”运动发祥地北京大学的学生会办公室里，我访问了一位青年，——他是以积极参加抗美援朝的行动来继承“五四”光荣传统的北京大学二千多位同学中典型青年之一。
    这位青年的名字叫做罗伯鹏，二十四岁，青年团员；北京大学物理系四年级生，一个毛泽东时代的好学生。他出身在湖南长沙一家破产的小地主家庭，当他在贵州浙江大学附属中学读书时，正是抗日战争炽烈的时期，他也像多少有着爱国热情的青年一样，被国民党反动派欺骗着参加了当时的青年军。但是不久，国民党反动派所干的那些反共反人民的罪行，使他发现自己是被欺骗了。他便开小差逃了出来。一九四六年秋季，他考入北京大学。在北京解放前那一段蓬勃的学生运动中，他受到很好的现实的教育，他在思想上、政治上找到了一个前进的方向。但这只不过是一个知识分子青年正确认识现实的开始。
    北京解放后第一个“五四”青年节——在这个中国新民主主义青年团成立的日子里，他光荣地被批准入团。到今天，他受到团的教育已经有两年了。虽然他在逐渐的进步着、改造着自己，但他正确地认清怎样做一个优秀的青年团员，却是在这次伟大的抗美援朝运动中。
    当抗美援朝运动展开以后，罗伯鹏和许多青年团员一样，积极地卷入了这个运动中。而这个伟大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动给他的教育也最深刻。在抗美援朝的宣传工作中，事实证明了他是一个优秀的宣传员。他创造了各种新的宣传形式，并克服困难，设法带动更多的同学来进行宣传工作，发挥了一个青年团员的积极性与创造性。譬如当原子弹在某些群众中造成恐怖心理的时候，他曾设法访问了曾经在日本广岛亲身经历过原子弹爆炸而生还的由明哲和初庆芝。他用他们的事实来说明原子弹的不足畏。当他发现娱乐场所乃是进行时事宣传的良好地点的时候，他曾经通过组织，发动许多同学到大华电影院、天桥等地，进行了四十余次的宣传演讲。在下乡宣传时，他更主动地去帮助农民们挖土拔草，然后再进行宣传，在农民中引起了良好的印象。在天文普及工作中，他又号召同学们适当地联系抗美援朝的宣传。最使同学们惊异的是，他并没有因为作了这样多的宣传工作而影响了学习，他的课业成绩都是比较优良的。
    罗伯鹏在抗美援朝运动以前，是有着许多缺点的。他曾经有着比较强烈的个人英雄主义的思想，自高自大，不相信组织的力量，又有知识分子的学生架子，与自由散漫的作风。这就是说，他的政治觉悟还不够高。譬如去年许多党员、青年团员要求去党训班学习的时候，最初他也是要求学习的一个但学习了一段时间，他因为自己过不惯比较严格的集体生活，又中途回校了。另一回，他因为不能认清组织的力量，因而在青年团举行各种会议的时候，他总是主观地认为会议不能解决什么问题，也不积极地去参加。对自己的毕业问题，他有着更多的考虑，表现了个人打算。
    罗伯鹏为什么能在抗美援朝运动中克服这么多的缺点，而转变成一个优秀的青年团员呢？这正像他自己所说：“在这次伟大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动的浪潮中，由于现实的教育和青年团对我的教育与帮助，使我认识到自己与祖国的关系，认识到了个人力量的渺小，个人的一切都应该为了祖国。没有祖国根本就没有个人。何况自己更是一个青年团员。下乡宣传中与广大农民的接触，更使我从实际中体验到农民的朴实勤劳，和他们对自己祖国的热爱。为了纪念“五四”青年节，深入地开展抗美援朝的宣传工作，我将更进一步积极主动地改造自己。”
