Economic Life Trends

	Salt Well Workers in Zigong City, Southern Sichuan
	Improved Working Conditions and Living Standards

	Zigong City, Southern Sichuan—in this largest well salt production area in the country, before liberation, workers had no dormitories, no beds or bedding. They spent the nights on "zuobao" (a kind of bamboo-made armchair). In winter, when it was unbearably cold, they would huddle around the chimney to keep warm. The kitchens lacked basic safety and hygiene equipment. Workers tending the coal stoves suffered from coal smoke, spitting out black phlegm, and many were sick year-round. After the liberation of Zigong City, the People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions continuously urged the capitalists to improve safety and hygiene equipment in the wells and stoves, and to improve the welfare of salt workers. Since August of last year, boilers and cranes, which are most prone to accidents, have been universally repaired once, and a system of regular inspections has been established. Equipment for exhausting coal smoke has also been improved. Salt-boiling workers are now equipped with masks. Most wells and stoves have now built worker dormitories and bathhouses, replacing the "zuobao" with beds. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also established eight spare-time schools for salt workers, with more than 1,800 people participating in learning. In addition, by April, sixty-six wells and stoves in the city had been approved to implement labor insurance.

	Carrying out Patriotic Spring Cleaning Competition
	Huaibei Salt Field Exceeds April Task

	Salt workers at the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field launched a patriotic spring cleaning competition. The salt production in April reached 107.3 percent of the original task, more than six times the output of the same month last year, with first-class salt accounting for more than 98.8 percent of the total output.

	In the course of education on the current affairs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the salt workers, based on their personal experiences, denounced the imperialist aggression crimes, and enhanced their political consciousness. On this basis, the salt workers have signed patriotic pledges and launched patriotic competitions between fields, stations, enclosures, beaches, and individuals. 1,553 of the 1,916 male and female salt workers in Tainan Field, which belongs to the salt field, have participated in the competition.

	Currently, the fields are conducting a major inspection of patriotic pledges and competition plans, striving to further exceed the production task in May.

	Cooperative Societies at All Levels in Pingyuan Province
	Supply Farmers with Large Quantities of High-Quality Cotton Seeds and Farm Tools

	Cooperative societies at all levels in Pingyuan Province have played a significant role in helping farmers solve the problems of spring plowing and production. According to incomplete statistics, cooperative societies at all levels supplied more than 225,200 pieces of various farm tools, more than 1,393,000 jin of high-quality cotton seeds, nearly 1,800 head of livestock, 30 carts, and 321 waterwheels in the first quarter of this year. The following methods were adopted in the supply work: 1. Convening joint meetings of grassroots cooperative cadres and craftsmen to investigate and study the needs of farmers in various places, and to put forward product quality standards to craftsmen. This solved the difficulties of craftsmen not being able to sell their products and farmers not being able to buy farm tools. 2. Organizing farm tool exhibitions and placing orders on the spot according to the needs of the members. 3. Contracting with blacksmiths to repair and manufacture farm tools at the grassroots cooperative level, with prices generally 10 percent lower than market prices. 4. Timely exchange and adjustment with neighboring districts. 5. Concluding joint cultivation contracts to solve the difficulties of farmers in disaster areas lacking draught animals and livestock feed.

　　经济生活动态
            川南自贡市的盐井工人
            劳动条件和生活均改善
    川南自贡市——这个全国最大的井盐生产区域里，解放前工人们没有宿舍，没有床铺和被褥，常年是睡在“座包”上（一种竹片作的靠椅）度夜，冬天冷得没法，就抱着烟囱取暖。灶房里面安全卫生设备异常缺乏。烧炭灶的工人们受着煤烟吹熏，吐的痰都是黑色，许多人整年病不离身。自贡市解放后，人民政府和市总工会即不断督促资方改善井、灶中的安全卫生设备，和改善盐工的福利生活。去年八月以来，最易出事故的锅炉和天车，已普遍修理一次，并订出了定期检查的制度。煤烟出口的设备也已改善。烧盐工人都带上了口罩。现大部分井、灶并修建了工人宿舍和浴室，把“座包”改成了床铺。市总工会又为盐工举办了八所业余学校，现在已有一千八百余人参加学习。此外，到四月止，全市已有六十六个井灶被批准实行劳动保险。
            开展爱国主义春扫竞赛
            淮北盐场超额完成四月份任务
    国营淮北盐场盐工展开爱国主义春扫竞赛，四月份产盐量达原定任务百分之一百零七点三，超过去年同月产量六倍多，头等盐占总产量百分之九十八点八强。
    盐工们在抗美援朝时事教育中，都以亲身的遭遇，控诉了帝国主义侵略罪行，提高了政治觉悟。在这一基础上，盐工们纷纷签订爱国公约，展开了场、所、圩、滩及个人间的爱国主义竞赛。该场所属台南场一千九百一十六个男女盐工，已有一千五百五十三人参加竞赛。
    现各场正进行爱国公约和竞赛计划的大检查，争取在五月份内进一步超额完成生产任务。

            平原省各级合作社
            大量供应农民优良棉种和农具
    平原省各级合作社在帮助农民解决春耕生产问题上起了很大的作用。据不完全统计，各级合作社在今年第一季度已供应各种农具二十二万五千二百多件，优良棉种一百三十九万三千多斤，牲口近一千八百头，大车三十辆，水车三百二十一挂。在供应工作中采用了以下几种方法：一、召开基层社干部与手工业者联席会，调查研究各地农民需要情况，并向手工业者提出产品质量的标准。这样就解决了手工业产品无销路和农民买不到农具的困难。二、组织农具展览，根据社员需要当场进行订货。三、以基层社为单位与铁炉匠订合同修打农具，一般价格低于市价百分之十以上。四、及时与友邻区进行交换与调剂。五、订立合耕地合同，解决灾区农民互缺畜力与牲口饲料的困难。
