Several Teaching Experiences from Industrial and Agricultural Spare-time Schools

    Several Characteristics of Industrial and Agricultural Spare-time Learning
    To do a good job in the teaching of industrial and agricultural spare-time education, we must first grasp the basic characteristics of workers and peasants in spare-time learning. This is an important basis for teaching. What are these characteristics?
    First, the workers and peasants participating in learning are all adults, and most of them are young and middle-aged. They have certain life knowledge and social experience. Therefore, they have a strong understanding and are motivated to improve. These are their advantages in learning. On the other hand, they bear certain work responsibilities, their energy is relatively scattered, and sometimes they cannot concentrate their attention on learning, and their memory is poor. This is their weakness.
    Second, the workers and peasants participating in spare-time learning are relatively complex in composition. There are men and women, young and old, and the level of education varies. This increases the difficulty of teaching.
    Third, after the workers and peasants have been liberated politically and economically, they urgently demand to learn for the needs of life and work. Therefore, in general, the current industrial and agricultural spare-time learning is basically a kind of crash course. This is also an important feature of the current industrial and agricultural spare-time learning.
  How to conduct teaching?
    Since industrial and agricultural spare-time learning has the above characteristics, we must pay attention to the following in teaching:
    First, we must closely link with reality and impart production and life knowledge to students. From the shallow to the deep, from the near to the far, from the concrete to the abstract, step by step, to achieve the goal of "learning for application". At the same time, in teaching, we can promote the method of "learning and applying immediately". For example, the winter school in Huangbai District, Ji'an County, taught the masses to learn simple methods of calculating public grain before sending public grain. However, we must prevent narrow utilitarianism here. For example, when some spare-time schools carry out literacy education, they teach whatever they encounter, teach whatever they use, and even teach some difficult-to-recognize and difficult-to-write characters. This violates the principle of gradual progress, destroys the planning and systematicness of teaching, and affects the effect of teaching.
    We must carry out teaching with emphasis according to specific circumstances. If there are too many subjects, without distinguishing between the important and the urgent, and proceeding simultaneously, it will only distract the students' energy and reduce the teaching effect. For example, for illiterates or those with very little literacy, literacy education should be the main focus. The planning of teaching should be strengthened.
    We must enlighten and cultivate students' learning consciousness and enthusiasm. This is a prerequisite for determining whether students can learn well. Generally speaking, workers and peasants are relatively active in learning. However, some people are not active enough in learning due to insufficient understanding of learning. This requires adopting a variety of methods in learning, such as cultural grievances, learning memories, etc., to enlighten and improve students' understanding, cultivate their thinking ability and research spirit, and develop the habit of self-study.
    When teaching, teachers must go deep into the masses. The language should be popular and understandable. Difficult-to-understand terms and nouns should be used as little as possible. The attitude should be kind. And help students solve difficult problems.
    On the basis of students' consciousness, establish learning systems and learning disciplines such as attendance, leave, examinations, meetings, and learning agreements. This can play a certain role in ensuring good teaching work. In addition, it is also necessary to regularly check students' academic performance, and promptly carry out praise and encouragement; cultivate key members in learning, so as to drive the whole. This is a very important job.
    Teaching methods should be flexible and diversified. For example, if the organizational form of learning is different (such as a decentralized group form or a regular centralized form), the teaching methods should also be different; even women's "Kang head groups" and "field learning groups" sometimes cannot completely adopt the same teaching methods. In the past, some places failed to grasp this principle and adopted a stereotyped teaching method, resulting in failure. We should create a variety of teaching methods according to different situations. For example, the "little teacher sends characters", "cultural learning posts" in the countryside, and "ordering teaching contracts" in factories are all feasible methods. In literacy teaching, methods such as character disassembly, homophony, pictographs, comparison, teaching character radicals, and recognizing characters by seeing objects are all feasible.
  Strengthen the leadership of teachers
    According to the principle of "people teaching people," teachers engaged in industrial and agricultural spare-time education must come from many sources, some are school teachers and students, some are office staff, and some are unemployed intellectuals. Only a very small number of factories have full-time teachers. Therefore, strengthening the organization and leadership of teachers (including little teachers) is the key to doing a good job in teaching.
    According to the experience of various places, teachers should undergo short-term intensive training before participating in teaching work, the purpose of which is to improve their understanding of spare-time education, so that they are familiar with teaching materials and research teaching methods.
    In factories, regular teaching research meetings (held about once a week) should be established with full-time teachers as the core to study teaching materials and exchange teaching experiences, and solve difficult problems in teaching. When necessary, full-time teachers or school teachers can provide guidance or demonstration teaching. This is a good way to take apprentices.
    As for little teachers, they mainly rely on school teachers to lead them, leading them to prepare before class, and regularly checking their teaching effects after class to improve their teaching methods. If possible, teaching research meetings can also be organized, led by school teachers or other teachers with higher qualifications. Enable them to establish a working method of "learning before teaching" and "teaching while learning."

　　工农业余学校的几点教学经验

    工农业余学习的几个特点
    要搞好工农业余教育教学工作，首先要掌握工农群众在业余学习上的基本特点，这是进行教学的重要依据。这些特点是什么呢？
    第一，参加学习的工农群众都是成人，大多数又都是青壮年。他们有一定的生活知识与社会经验。因此，他们的理解力较强，而且有上进心。这是他们在学习上的优点。而另一方面，他们担负着一定的工作，精力较分散，有时不能把注意力集中到学习方面去，记忆力较差。这是他们的弱点。
    第二，参加业余学习的工农群众，在组成成份上比较复杂。有男的有女的，有年青的有年老的，文化程度亦高低不齐。这就增加了教学上的困难。
    第三，工农群众在政治、经济上翻身以后，为了生活和工作的需要，迫切地要求着学习。因此，一般说来，目前的工农业余学习，基本上是一种速成性质的学习。这也是当前工农业余学习的一个重要特点。
  怎样进行教学？
    工农业余学习既有上述的特点，我们在教学上就必须注意：
    首先要密切地联系实际，向学员灌输生产和生活知识。由浅入深，由近及远，由具体到抽象，循序渐进，达到“学以致用”的目的。同时我们在教学中，可以提倡“即学即用”的办法，如辑安县黄柏区冬学，在送公粮前教群众学习计算公粮的简便方法。但这里必须防止狭隘的实用主义。例如某些业余学校进行识字教育时，遇到什么就教什么，用到什么就教什么，甚至教一些难认难写的字。这样就破坏了循序渐进的原则，破坏了教学的计划性和系统性，影响了教学的效果。
    我们要根据具体情况有重点地进行教学。如果课目太多，不分轻重缓急，齐头并进，只会分散学员的精力，降低教学效果。例如对不识字或识字很少的文盲，应以识字教育为主。应该加强教学计划性。
    我们要启发和培养学员的学习自觉性和积极性。这是决定学员能否学好的前提条件。一般地说，工农群众对学习是比较积极的。但某些人因对学习认识不足，在学习上表现出不够积极。这就需要在学习中采取多种多样的方式，如文化诉苦、学习回忆等，启发与提高学员的认识，培养他们的思考能力与钻研精神，养成自学的习惯。
    教学时，教员必须深入群众。语言要通俗明白。难懂的术语、名词，应该尽可能的少用。态度要和蔼。并要帮助学员解决困难问题。
    在学员自觉的基础上，建立出席、请假、考试、会议、学习公约等学习制度与学习纪律。这对于搞好教学工作，能起一定的保证作用。此外，还要经常地检查学员的学习成绩，及时进行表扬、鼓励；培养学习中的骨干分子，借以带动全体。这是一个非常重要的工作。
    教学方法要灵活、多样化。例如，学习的组织形式不同（如分散的小组形式或正规的集中形式），教学方法，亦应有所区别；即如妇女炕头小组和地头学习小组，有时也不能完全采取相同的教法。过去某些地方没有掌握这一原则，采取千篇一律的教法，结果遭到了失败。我们应该根据不同的情况，创造多种多样的教法，例如农村的“小先生送字”、“文化学习岗”、工厂里的“订教学合同”，在识字教学上的拆字、谐音、象形、比较、教字首、见物识字等，都是可行的办法。
  加强对教员的领导
    根据“以民教民”的方针，从事工农业余教育的教员，不能不来自多方面的，有的是学校教员、学生，有的是机关职员，有的是失业知识分子。只有为数极少的工厂，设有专任教员。因此，加强对教员（包括小先生）的组织领导，乃是搞好教学工作的关键。
    根据各地的经验，教员在参加教学工作前，应进行短期的集训，目的在于提高他们对业余教育的认识，使他们熟悉教材和研究教学方法。
    在工厂，应建立以专任教员为核心的定期教学研究会（一星期左右召开一次），研究教材和交流教学经验，解决教学上的困难问题。必要时可由专任教员或学校教员加以指导，或作示范教学。这是带徒弟的好办法。
    至于小先生，则主要依靠学校教员来领导，在课前领导他们进行准备，在课后则经常检查其教学效果，改进他们的教学方法。可能的话也可以组织教学研究会，由学校教员或其他程度较高的教师参加领导。使他们树立起“先学后教”、“边教边学”的工作方法。
