　　A Gift for Red May
    Nai Yin, Dong Shaoyin, Qian Feng
            I. On the Road to Victory
    Just as the working people of the world joyfully welcomed their great festival of struggle – “May Day,” the brave warriors of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People’s Army, brought a precious gift to Red May with new and glorious victories.

    The “offensive victory” that the American aggressors had boasted about for so long was completely bankrupt in just eight days, from April 22nd to 30th. Just a month before, when the American aggressor troops and their accomplices continued to push towards the 38th parallel, a young company commander of the Volunteer Army said, "Just wait and see! Before long, we will give them another solid beating." And now, the day of launching a powerful counterattack against the enemy had finally arrived. The Volunteer Army warriors, who had long been unable to restrain their soaring fighting spirit, crossed the mountains and forests set ablaze by enemy planes, and passed through villages destroyed by enemy planes and still billowing with smoke, surging towards the front line like a tide of anger. The Korean people crowded the avenues all night long, welcoming and seeing off the people's mighty army with boundless joy. All the intersections and walls were plastered with slogans like “Long Live the Victory of the Volunteer Army!” and “Demand a Blood Debt from American Imperialism!” The Korean people, who were repairing the roads on the highway, cheered the troops non-stop. The Korean people, driving ox carts to support the front line, stopped their carts to make way for the Volunteer Army, shouting, "Dongmu, bali bali da Migun! (Comrades, quickly strike the American army!)"

    Next to the ruins of Hadeolli, two Korean old women were carrying boiled water to entertain the passing troops, and three children, all under ten years old, were singing "Forever Follow the Communist Party" in Chinese. They sang for as long as the troops marched. In the cold spring night, the trembling songs of the Korean children, wearing thin clothes, were extraordinarily touching. Chen Changde, the deputy squad leader of a certain unit, with tears in his eyes, shouted to his comrades, "Comrades, can we let these children be killed by the American devils?" The comrades unanimously replied, "No! Forward! Defeat the American aggressors!" In this way, the Volunteer Army soldiers, filled with vengeful anger, quickened their pace, and charged towards the enemy.
            II. Seize the Enemy and Annihilate Them!
    On the afternoon of April 22nd, the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army and the Korean People’s Army launched a powerful counterattack against the invading army from a long front stretching from Yanggu in the east to Munsan in the west. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army seized the Longhuadong Peak, 795.4 meters high, between Cheorwon and Gimhwa, from the dense forests and thorns, and annihilated part of the 2nd Battalion of the 19th Regiment of the US 24th Division, thus cutting a gap in the middle of the enemy's front line. The Volunteer Army's follow-up troops poured into the enemy's depth from here, and launched a powerful pursuit.

    After the enemy's line was cut, the orders from the command's telephones, the commands issued by the commanders on the battlefield, and the slogans of encouragement among the soldiers were all the same: "Seize the enemy!" When the central route troops advanced forward, news came that the western route troops had crossed the Imjin River and were heading straight for Uijeongbu. The soldiers were anxious and said, "Hurry up and chase! The brother troops have gone ahead of us!" So everyone advanced day and night, eating cold water mixed with fried flour because they didn't have time to cook. If the main road was blocked, they took the side roads. If the side roads were also crowded, many troops opened up roads through the uninhabited swamps and dense forests. The soldiers proudly said, "Stretch out your two swift legs and catch up with the enemy's 'mechanization'." Indeed, it was so! On the highway from Pocheon and Gapyeong to Seoul, countless damaged enemy tanks, cars, and artillery pieces were jammed. Enemy infantry was chased and jumped off cliffs to escape. At the cliffs of Baegun Mountain, Shanghai Peak, and Domahyeon, there were piles of corpses of American bandits who had fallen to their deaths.

    On April 24th, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army caught up with a part of the US 24th Division at Unak Mountain in southeastern Pocheon County. The enemy set up a howitzer position at Jiangdong (village) at the foot of the mountain, thinking that they could use planes and artillery to cover their troops as they fled south along the highway. They did not expect that the Volunteer Army had already inserted into their flank. The Volunteer Army warriors climbed the thorns, and used pickaxes to dig holes on the cliffs and precipices to gain a foothold, monitoring the enemy at the foot of the mountain like mountain eagles. Before dark, the warriors of all routes, lightly armed, went straight down the mountain, cutting the enemy into several sections. The infantry specifically targeted the infantry on the enemy's cars, the anti-tank soldiers specifically targeted the tanks, and the artillerymen aimed at the enemy's artillery positions and bombarded them fiercely. This swift and sudden attack caught the enemy off guard. The enemy's artillerymen hurriedly hung the howitzers on the cars and fled. However, as soon as the car got on the highway, it was destroyed by the Volunteer Army infantry. The American soldiers, with nowhere to go, scurried around looking for tanks, but the tanks were too busy protecting themselves from the Volunteer Army's rocket launchers and anti-tank grenades. The drivers in the tanks crawled out to escape, but were also killed on the side of the highway. At this time, eight enemy planes broke in and circled low, and the heavy machine gunners, who were anxious because they had no target to shoot at, concentrated their fire on the air, injuring three enemy planes on the spot, and the rest of the enemy planes did not dare to fly low. The battle lasted from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The Volunteer Army killed more than 100 American soldiers and captured more than 80 alive. Most of the 555th Howitzer Battalion of the US 24th Division was annihilated. The Volunteer Army captured twelve howitzers, destroyed eighteen tanks, two armored vehicles, and sixty-eight cars. American artillery lieutenant Sharpe, who was captured in the battle, said despondently: "We knew you were chasing from the north, so we hurried south, but we didn't expect your two legs to chase faster than tanks and cars. We were still caught by you."

    The US 25th Division ran south as soon as it made contact with the Volunteer Army. The 4th Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, which crossed the Hantang River and inserted into the enemy's rear, struck the sides of the highway in Akita-ri, disrupting the enemy's artillery positions. They destroyed forty-two enemy trucks fleeing south, causing the rest of the enemy's cars and artillery vehicles to scurry around. Ye Tingyu, the squad leader of the small artillery squad, handed over the small artillery to others, and held a grenade to block the enemy's cars from escaping. He loudly ordered two enemy cars to stop with a sentence of English he had just learned, and confiscated them. In this interception battle, the company's warriors killed and wounded an entire enemy company. American soldier Green said after being captured: "Last winter, there were eight people left in our class. After crossing the Han River, three more were killed. Now I only know that I am still alive."
            III. American Soldiers Waiting to be Captured
    Under the rapid pursuit of the Korean and Chinese People's troops, many American soldiers were left behind by their own retreating troops, waiting to be captured. Many stories of American deserters "waiting to be收容" (shōu róng, receive and accommodate as refugees, which at the time was essentially equivalent to being captured) are circulating on the front lines. After these American soldiers lost contact with their main forces, they did not plan to look for their own teams, but waited for or actively sought the Volunteer Army to "收容" them. Lieutenant Keenan, the platoon leader, and Sergeant Ross, the squad leader, of Company A, 3rd Battalion, 5th Regiment of the US 24th Division, were captured by the Volunteer Army in this way. Keenan also said triumphantly: "I shouted '投降' (tóu xiáng, surrender) in Chinese for a long time!" On the night of April 23rd, when a certain unit of the Volunteer Army passed by the highway south of Shanghai Peak, suddenly an American deserter from the US 24th Division ran over from the side of the road, shouting "O.K." and raising his hands to request "收容." Many American deserters automatically approached the Volunteer Army to request to be prisoners of war in this way. Some sat in air-raid shelters or houses waiting to be captured.

    On April 23rd, Wu Yongcheng, a staff officer of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, took two signalmen to a high ground to observe the terrain, and suddenly ran into a group of American deserters with automatic weapons. Staff Officer Wu waved his pistol upwards and shouted, "O.K." Twenty-six soldiers of the US 24th Division obediently laid down their weapons in front of the three of them. Liu Changwu, the deputy squad leader of the 9th Squad of the 4th Company of a certain unit, captured twenty American soldiers on Guangde Mountain by shouting, many of whom carried propaganda materials and "Surrender Safety Certificates" distributed by the Korean and Chinese People's troops.

    The spring of 1951 is a spring full of stormy battles. The working people of the world are cheering for the new achievements of the cause of peace. And the heroic sons and daughters of China and Korea, standing at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace, are clenching their fists, preparing to contribute more victories to the peace-loving people of the world.

　　红五月的献礼
    耐因　董少音　前锋
            一、在走向胜利的道路上
    正当全世界劳动人民欢呼着迎接自己伟大的战斗的节日——“五一”节的时候，中国人民志愿军的勇士们和朝鲜人民军一起，用新的辉煌的胜利给红五月带来了珍贵的献礼。
    美国侵略者很久以来所狂妄地吹嘘着的“攻势胜利”，在四月二十二日到三十日的仅仅八天之内，就完全破了产。还在一个月以前，当美国侵略军和它的帮凶们继续向三八度线窜犯的时候，志愿军的一位青年连长曾经说：“等着瞧吧！要不多久我们又会结结实实地给他们一顿痛击。”而现在，这向敌人举行强大反击的日子终于来到了。早已按捺不住的斗志旺盛的志愿军勇士们，翻过被敌机纵火焚烧着的山林，走过被敌机炸毁了的还冒着浓烟的村庄，怒潮似地涌向前线。朝鲜人民整夜拥挤在大道旁边，带着无比的欢欣之情，迎、送人民的雄师。所有的路口上和墙壁上都贴着“志愿军胜利万岁！”“向美帝国主义讨还血债！”的标语。在公路上进行抢修工作的朝鲜人民，不停地向部队欢呼。赶着牛车支援前线的朝鲜人民停下车来让路给志愿军，嘴里喊着：“道木，巴力巴力打米军！（同志，赶快打美军）”
    在下德里的废墟旁，有两个朝鲜老婆婆抬着开水，招待过路的部队，还有三个不满十岁的孩子用中国话唱着《永远跟着共产党走》。部队走多久他们就唱多久。在初春的寒夜里，穿着单薄的衣服的朝鲜孩子们的颤抖的歌声，使人异常感动。某部副班长陈昌德噙着泪水向战友们喊道：“同志们，我们能让这些孩子们被美国鬼子杀死吗？”战友们一致回答说：“不能！前进呀！打败美国侵略者！”志愿军的战士们就是这样怀着复仇的怒火，加快了前进的脚步，冲向敌人。
            二、抓住敌人消灭它！
    四月二十二日下午，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军从东起杨口西至汶山的漫长战线上对侵略军发起了强大的反击。志愿军某部从密林荆棘中攻占了铁原、金化间高达七百九十五点四公尺的龙华洞高峰，歼灭了守敌美军二十四师十九团二营一部，从而在敌军中部阵线上割开了一道缺口。志愿军后续部队从这里源源涌向敌人的纵深，展开了强大的追击战。
    当敌人的阵线被割裂以后，从指挥机关的电话机传来的命令，战场上指挥员下达的口令，战士们彼此间的鼓动口号，都是同样的一句话：“抓住敌人！”当中路部队向前挺进时，传来了西路部队已跨过临津江直捣议政府的消息，战士们着急地说：“快追呀！兄弟部队赶到我们前面去了！”于是大家日夜猛进，来不及做饭就用冷水拌炒面粉吃，大道走不开走小路，小路也挤不下，很多部队就从没有人走过的沼泽密林里开路前进。战士们自豪地说：“拉开两条飞毛腿，追上敌人的‘机械化’”。的确是这样的！从抱川、加平通往汉城的公路上，拥塞着数不清的被打坏了的敌人的坦克、汽车、大炮。敌人的步兵被追得跳崖逃命。在白云山、上海峰、道马岘的悬崖下，摆着成堆的跌死的美国强盗的尸体。
    四月二十四日，志愿军某部在抱川郡东南的云岳山追上了美军第二十四师一部。敌人在山脚下的江口洞（村）设了榴弹炮阵地，满以为借着飞机大炮可以掩护他的部队沿着公路往南逃跑。他们没有料想到志愿军已经插到他们的侧后。志愿军勇士们手攀荆棘，用十字镐在悬崖绝壁上捣出洞来落脚，登到山头上，像山鹰似地监视住山脚下的敌人。还没有等到天黑，各路勇士们就轻装直奔山下，拦腰把敌人截成几段。步兵专找敌人汽车上的步兵打，反坦克手专打坦克，炮兵们对准了敌人炮兵阵地猛轰。这样迅雷不及掩耳的突袭，打得敌人来不及还手。敌人的炮兵慌忙把榴弹炮挂在汽车上逃跑。可是，汽车刚一上公路就被志愿军步兵打坏了。走头无路的美国兵东奔西窜地找坦克，可是坦克正被志愿军的火箭筒、反坦克炸弹打得自顾不暇，坦克里的驾驶员爬了出来想逃命，也被打死在公路边。这时有八架敌机闯来低飞盘旋，重机枪手们正在因为没有射击的对象而发急，就集中火力对空射击，当场击伤敌机三架，其余的敌机就都不敢低飞了。战斗从下午三点钟打到七点钟。志愿军打死了美军一百多名，活捉八十多名。美军第二十四师第五五五榴弹炮营大部被歼。志愿军缴获了十二门榴弹炮，击毁了十八辆坦克，两辆装甲车和六十八辆汽车。在战斗中被俘的美军炮兵中尉夏普沮丧地说：“我们知道你们从北面追来了，就赶紧往南逃，没想到你们两条腿追起来比坦克汽车还要快，我们到底还是被你们抓着了。”
    美军第二十五师刚和志愿军接上火就撒开腿往南逃跑了。跨过汉滩川插入敌后的志愿军某部第四连，打到秋田里的公路两侧，打乱了敌人的炮兵阵地。他们击毁了四十二辆南逃的敌人卡车，打得敌人其余的汽车和炮车四处乱窜。小炮班班长叶挺玉把小炮交给了别人，抱起一颗炸弹挡住敌人汽车的逃路。他用刚学会的一句英语高声命令敌人两辆汽车停下来，把它们缴了过来。在这一次截击战中，该连勇士杀伤了敌人整整一个连。美军士兵格林在被俘后说：“去年冬天我们班里剩下八个人，过汉江后又被打死了三个，现在我只知道我自己还活着。”
            三、坐以待俘的美国兵
    在朝、中人民部队迅速追击之下，很多美国兵被丢在他们自己溃退的部队后面，等着被俘。在前线流传着许多美国溃兵“等待收容”的故事。这些美国兵在与他们主力失掉联络之后，并不打算去找自己的队伍，却等着或自动寻求志愿军“收容”。美军第二十四师独立第五团三营一连中尉排长基南和上士班长鲁斯就是这样被志愿军俘掳的。基南还很得意地说：“我用中国话喊‘投降’，喊了老半天了！”四月二十三日夜晚，志愿军某部路过上海峰南面的公路时，忽然有一个美军第二十四师的溃兵从道旁跑过来，口喊“Ｏ·Ｋ·”高举双手请求“收容”。不少的美国溃兵都是像这样自动找上志愿军请求当俘虏的。有的则坐在防空洞或房子里等着被俘。
    四月二十三日志愿军某部参谋吴永成带了两个通讯员到一个高地上观察地形，忽然碰上了一群拿着自动武器的美国溃兵。吴参谋把手枪向上一挥，喊了一声“Ｏ·Ｋ·”二十六个美国第二十四师的士兵就在他们三个人面前乖乖地放下了武器。某部四连九班副班长刘长吾在广德山上用喊话俘掳了二十个美国兵，其中好些人都带着朝、中人民部队散发的宣传品和“投降安全证”。
    一九五一年的春天是充满了暴风雨般的战斗的春天，全世界的劳动人民正在欢呼着和平事业的新的成就。而站在保卫和平的斗争的最前线的中国和朝鲜的英勇儿女们，正在握紧了拳头，准备以更多的胜利贡献给全世界爱好和平的人民。                          【新华社】
