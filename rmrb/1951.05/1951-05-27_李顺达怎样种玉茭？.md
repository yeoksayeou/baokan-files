　　How does Li Shunda grow corn?
    Comrades Limin, Yusan, etc.: Regarding your question about Li Shunda's method of growing King Golden Queen corn, the following is a summary based on the investigation report of the agricultural technicians sent by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government:

　　In the spring of 1950, Li Shunda planted King Golden Queen corn on approximately one mu of newly repaired terraced fields on the hillside. Planting took place between Grain Rain and Beginning of Summer, with three kernels sown per hole. The row spacing was two chi, and the plant spacing was two and a half to three chi. Approximately one thousand seedlings were retained per mu. The land was plowed three times: the first time was autumn plowing to clear the stubble, the second time was before the ground froze to turn the soil, and the third time was before sowing. It was harrowed twice: the first time was after deep plowing before the ground froze, and the second time was after the ground thawed in the spring. It was ridged four times: the first time was after autumn plowing to clear the stubble, the second time was after deep plowing, the third time was after plowing the land before sowing, and the fourth time was after sowing. It was weeded three times: the first time was when the seedlings were six or seven cun tall, at which time thinning began; the second time was when the seedlings were about two and a half chi tall, mainly for loosening the soil; the third time was when the tassels emerged, along with earthing up. Basal fertilizer and top dressing were applied once each: for basal fertilizer, 100 dan of sheep manure and 10 dan of human waste were applied by digging holes and burying them before sowing. For top dressing, holes were dug two cun away from the seedlings during the second weeding, and human waste was poured in and buried. A total of 980 jin of corn was harvested.

　　The reason why Li Shunda was able to create such a high production record is first and foremost due to the effect of the newly built terraces changing the soil and increasing fertility (the two plots of land where he grew corn, one was brown soil and the other was red clay). Secondly, he paid attention to cultivation and fertilization techniques (but the fact that thinning did not begin until the seedlings were six or seven cun tall is still worth studying and improving). In addition, seed selection also played a role. The seeds used by Li Shunda were selected and hung on the beams of a house that was not smoked by coal fires.

　　李顺达怎样种玉茭？
    利民、玉三等同志：你们问李顺达种金皇后玉茭的方法，现在根据山西省人民政府所派农业技术人员的调查报告，简复如下：
    一九五○年春季李顺达在他自己新修整的半山坡的两块梯田内种了金皇后玉茭共约一亩。在谷雨立夏之间播种，每穴点播三粒。行距二尺，株距二尺五至三尺。一亩地共留苗约一千株。共耕三遍：第一次秋耕灭茬，第二次地冻前翻土，第三次在播种前。共耙二遍：第一次在地冻前深耕翻土后，第二次在春季解冻后。共耢四遍：第一次在秋耕灭茬后，第二次在深耕翻土后，第三次在播种前耕地后，第四次在播种后。共锄三遍：第一次为苗高六、七寸时，同时开始间苗；第二次为苗高约二尺半时，主要是松土；第三次在出顶穗时，连同培土一起进行。施基肥、追肥各一次：基肥在播种前以羊厩肥一百担，人粪尿十担，掘穴点施后埋土。追肥在第二次锄苗时于苗旁二寸外掘穴浇人粪尿埋土。共收获玉茭九百八十市斤。
    李顺达所以能创造这样高的生产纪录，首先是新修梯田改变了土壤、增加地力的效果（他种玉茭的这两块地，一块是褐色土壤，一块是赤色粘土）。其次是注意了耕作和施肥的技术（但是苗高六、七寸时始间苗，尚值得研究改进）。此外选种也有关系。李顺达用的种籽，是经选好的玉茭悬挂在没有煤火熏的房梁上的。
