    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd] The investigation team sent by the International Democratic Women's Federation at the invitation of the Korean women to investigate the atrocities of the U.S. troops invading Korea arrived in Pyongyang on the 18th. Pak Jeong-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, Heo Jeong-suk, Minister of Culture and Propaganda of the Korean Cabinet, representatives of people from all walks of life in Pyongyang, and envoys from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Romania and other countries to Korea went to welcome them.
    The investigation team consists of twenty-eight people, including twenty representatives and eight staff members. The head of the delegation is Mrs. Rodd, a leader of the Canadian Democratic Women's Movement. The vice-chairmen are Bachman (Denmark) and Liu Qingyang (China). Other representatives are: Ovsyannikova (Soviet Union), Bai Lang, Li Keng (China), Le Thi Que (Vietnam), Juliette Tiglier (France), Felton (Britain), Carter (Denmark), Hannyva (Belgium), Svatosova (Czech Republic), Heyligers (Netherlands), Abasia Vaudie (Algeria), Conn (German Democratic Republic), Wachter (West Germany), Priketel (Austria), Fatma (Tunisia), Gala (Italy), Rodriguez (Cuba). Representatives from Australia and the United States have not yet arrived.
    The investigation team is currently divided into groups to investigate the atrocities of the American aggressor troops in destroying cities and villages and massacring the Korean people - especially the abuse and murder of women and children - in various parts of Korea.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd] More than 600 representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a welcoming meeting on the evening of the 19th to welcome the investigation team of the International Democratic Women's Federation, which came to Korea to investigate the atrocities of the U.S. military.
    Pak Jeong-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, delivered a welcoming speech first. On behalf of all Korean women, she extended warm greetings and thanks to all the representatives of the investigation team and democratic women all over the world. She indignantly exposed the various atrocities of American imperialism in Korea. She said: The outstanding sons and daughters of Korea are fighting heroically with the Chinese People's Volunteers on the front line. The broad masses of Korean women have made great labor achievements in supporting the front line in factories, mines, and rural areas. She emphasized that the Korean women, who are supported and encouraged by women all over the world, are invincible.
    Mrs. Rodd, head of the investigation team, delivered a speech. She said: We will do our best to help our people understand your struggles and the atrocities of our Western soldiers. We are willing to do our best to strive for peace. If I were younger and had time, I would stay in Korea to help you rebuild your country. Mrs. Rodd's enthusiastic speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.
   Liu Qingyang, Deputy Head of the investigation team and representative of Chinese women, said in her speech: The Korean people are standing on the forefront of defending world peace and waging a heroic and just war, which has greatly moved all of us Chinese people and women. The interests of the Chinese and Korean people are the same. Therefore, we should work together to eliminate the American imperialist aggressors. She said: We will faithfully complete our investigation task, make a report, and publicize it to the world.
    Ovsyannikova, the representative of Soviet women, said: I have only observed the cities of Korea for three days, and I have clearly seen that the American imperialists are even more brutal than the German fascists. Let us recall the situation in Stalingrad. Stalingrad was completely destroyed and turned into ruins. However, now Stalingrad is more beautiful than before. Although all your constructions and properties have been destroyed, the Korean people, like the Soviet people, will eliminate the vicious enemy, rebuild the beautiful city and enjoy a happy life. Victory belongs to the Korean people who are fighting heroically against the enemy and are firmly supported by the world's democratic camp.
    In their speeches, other representatives unanimously paid tribute to the Korean women in their heroic struggle on behalf of the women of their own countries.
    After the meeting, the Korean National Theater Art Troupe performed songs and dances.

    【新华社平壤二十三日电】平壤各界代表六百余人于十九日晚举行欢迎大会，欢迎来朝调查美军暴行的国际民主妇女联合会调查团。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱首先致欢迎辞。她代表全朝鲜妇女，向调查团全体代表和全世界民主妇女热烈地致敬致谢。她激愤地揭露了美帝国主义在朝鲜的种种暴行。她说：朝鲜的优秀儿女正在前线与中国人民志愿军一起进行着英勇的战斗。朝鲜的广大妇女在工厂、矿山、农村支援前线，建立了巨大的劳动功勋。她强调指出：受着全世界妇女有力支援和鼓舞的朝鲜妇女，是不可征服的。
    调查团团长罗德夫人发表演说。她说：我们将尽最大的努力，帮助我们的人民了解你们的斗争情况与我们西方的士兵们的种种暴行。我们愿以全力争取和平。如果我还年青而有时间的话，我将留在朝鲜帮助你们重新建设你们的国家。罗德夫人热情的演说受到全场热烈的欢迎。 
  调查团副团长、中国妇女代表刘清扬致词说：朝鲜人民站在保卫世界和平的最前线，进行英勇的正义战争，使我们全中国人民和妇女非常感动。中朝人民的利害是一致的。因此，我们应当共同努力，消灭美帝国主义侵略者。她说：我们一定忠实地完成我们的调查任务，作出报告，向全世界公布。
    苏联妇女代表奥夫桑尼科娃说：我到朝鲜的城市只观察了三天，就已清楚地看到美帝国主义者比德国法西斯还要残暴。让我们回想一下斯大林格勒的情形。斯大林格勒曾被完全破坏，变成了废墟。但是，现在斯大林格勒比过去还要美丽。你们的一切建设和财产虽全被破坏了，但是，朝鲜人民会像苏联人民一样，消灭凶恶的敌人，重建美丽的城市而享受幸福的生活。胜利是属于和敌人英勇斗争、受到世界民主阵营坚决支持的朝鲜人民的。
    其他代表在讲话中，一致代表自己国家的妇女，向英勇斗争中的朝鲜妇女致敬。
