　　A Good Way to Promote the Labor Emulation Movement
    ——Introducing the Broadcast Rally Jointly Organized by the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions and the People's Broadcasting Station
    Qiao Yuzhou
    The method of organizing worker broadcast rallies by the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions and the city's People's Broadcasting Station to promote labor emulation is worth learning from other regions. The city's trade union and broadcasting station have successively held several broadcast rallies. Through these broadcast rallies, the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has been inspired, and more workers have been involved in the labor emulation movement, thereby enabling various factories to complete their production tasks ahead of schedule. The Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station was therefore commended by Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government.
    A broadcast rally is a rally that connects tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people scattered in various corners through the connection of radio receivers and the broadcasting station's transmitting studio (the central venue), forming an organized and led rally. Each branch venue can speak to the central venue by telephone, and then the central venue broadcasts directly to the entire city.
    On January 27th, before the Shenyang Second Labor Model Representative Conference, the city's Federation of Trade Unions and the Broadcasting Station jointly held a broadcast evening, calling on workers to greet the Labor Model Representative Conference with no absenteeism or tardiness during the Spring Festival. This meeting achieved considerable success. On the evening of the same day, more than 100 units launched a wave of challenges and responses. The next day, some factories spontaneously initiated signature campaigns against tardiness and absenteeism. Ninety-eight percent of the workers in the Shenyang No. 8 Textile Factory and the Woolen Mill participated in the signing. Workers who were originally planning to go home for the New Year also put aside their plans to return home and concentrated on production in the factory. Encouraged by this spirit of competition, all units participating in the conference overfulfilled their production tasks for January.
    Subsequently, the city's Clothing Processing Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized the "Citywide Clothing Processing Production Emulation Broadcast Rally" and the "Celebration of the Victorious Success of the Shenyang Second Labor Model Representative Conference" with the Broadcasting Station, respectively. Through the broadcast rallies, a production emulation movement was widely launched in more than 200 units.
    In order to facilitate the inspection of the competition, the city's People's Broadcasting Station also opened a "Production Triumphs" time slot during workers' time to encourage units that had put forward competition conditions at the broadcast rally to strive to report their successes during the "Triumphs" time; at the same time, it mobilized units that had not announced competition conditions at the broadcast rally to report their achievements during the "Production Triumphs" time.
    In this way, in the production in March, as of the morning of the 21st, four factories and five workshops reported their successes to Chairman Mao, Chairman Gao Gang, and the city's workers during the "Production Triumphs" time. On April 7th, the city's Federation of Trade Unions cooperated with the Broadcasting Station again to hold the "Commemorating 'May Day' Competition Rally," organizing seventy-eight production units (mainly groups and workshops) from eleven industrial systems to broadcast their competition conditions at the meeting. The broadcast meeting greatly mobilized the emotions of the workers. There were more than 200 phone calls requesting to speak. Units in the railway system without internal telephones specifically sent people to the central venue - the Broadcasting Station - to announce the conditions guaranteed by their units. Zheng Xikun, the driver of the No. 105 chartered train group in Sujiatun, rushed to Shenyang overnight in his busy schedule, representing the workers in his group to propose the conditions for commemorating "May Day" to the staff and workers of various stations, sections, and factories along the China Changchun Railway.
    This method of promoting labor emulation by the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions and the Broadcasting Station has played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the first quarter's production tasks. This experience has attracted the attention of some regions. Shenyang, Benxi, Anshan, Fushun, and other places have all held such rallies.

　　一个推动劳动竞赛运动的好办法
    ——介绍沈阳市总工会和人民广播电台联合组织的广播大会
    乔雨舟
    沈阳市总工会和该市人民广播电台组织职工广播大会推动劳动竞赛的办法，值得各地学习。该市工会和广播电台曾先后举办了数次广播大会，通过这些广播大会，鼓舞了广大职工的爱国热情，使更多的职工投入了劳动竞赛运动，从而使各厂提前完成了生产任务。沈阳人民广播电台因此获得了东北人民政府高岗主席的嘉勉。
    广播大会是把分散在各个角落的数万或数十万群众，通过收音机和广播电台发音室（中心会场）的联系，形成一个有组织和有领导的大会。各个分会场可以用电话向中心会场讲话，然后再由中心会场直接向全市进行广播。
    一月二十七日，沈阳市二届劳动模范代表会议前，该市总工会和广播电台联合举办了一个广播晚会，号召职工以过春节时不欠勤、不迟到来迎接劳动模范代表会议。这个会议获得了不小的成绩。当日晚上，就有百余单位展开了挑战应战的热潮。第二天，某些工厂便自动的发起了不迟到、不欠勤的签名运动。沈阳第八纺织厂和毛织厂工人中百分之九十八都参加了签名。本来准备回家过年的工友也放下了回家的打算，在工厂里安心生产。在这种竞赛热情的鼓舞下，参加大会的各单位都超额完成了一月份的生产任务。
    其后，该市被服加工委员会和市总工会又分别与广播电台联合举办了“全市被服加工生产竞赛广播大会”和“庆祝沈阳市二届劳动模范代表会议胜利成功大会”，通过广播大会，在二百多个单位中广泛地展开了生产竞赛运动。
    为着便于对竞赛进行检查，该市人民广播电台又在职工时间内开辟了“生产捷报”时间，推动已在广播大会提出竞赛条件的单位，争取在“捷报”时间内报捷；同时并发动没有在广播大会上发表竞赛条件的单位，在“生产报捷”时间内报告自己的成绩。
    这样在三月份的生产中，到二十一日上午为止，就有四个工厂和五个车间在“生产捷报”时间内向毛主席、高岗主席和全市职工报捷。四月七日，该市总工会又与广播电台合作，举办了“纪念‘五一’竞赛大会”，组织了十一个产业系统七十八个生产单位（主要是小组和车间）在会上广播了自己的竞赛条件。广播会大大鼓动了工友们的情绪。要求发言的电话先后有二百多次。铁路系统没有市内电话的单位特地派人赶至中心会场——广播电台，宣布本单位保证的条件。苏家屯一○五号包车组司机郑锡坤在百忙中星夜赶到沈阳，代表本组工友向中长铁路各站、段和工厂职工提出了纪念“五一”的挑战条件。
    沈阳市总工会和广播电台的这种推动劳动竞赛的方法，对保证完成首季生产任务曾起了很大作用。这个经验已引起了一些地区的重视。沈阳、本溪、鞍山、抚顺等地都纪经举办。
