    The Just Action of the Masses Reporting Counter-Revolutionaries, the Xianyang Public Security Bureau of Shaanxi Province Actually Does Not Support It

    The Xianyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau of Shaanxi Province does not support the just action of the masses in reporting counter-revolutionary elements, resulting in the escape of captured counter-revolutionary elements.

    The counter-revolutionary element Li Zibin (alias Hao San) from our county (Zhengyang, Henan), with landlord status, once served as a bandit army battalion commander, joint security director, and leader of a Military Intelligence Bureau special task force. Before liberation, he killed seven of our cadres and people, raped women, and persecuted the people. After liberation, the criminal was captured by the government and released after education. The criminal then organized more than 30 bandits, carrying weapons, and impersonated our county's brigade to burn, kill, and loot everywhere. The Zhengyang County People's Government, in order to eliminate harm for the people, issued wanted notices for him twice.

    After the land reform in our county, especially during the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, the political consciousness of the masses greatly improved, and they automatically assisted the government in arresting counter-revolutionary elements. In early April, two people from the first district of our county learned that bandit Li was in Xianyang County, Shaanxi, and went to investigate on their own initiative. On April 7th, they arrived in Xianyang, clarified the hiding place of bandit Li, and reported to the First Resident Office of the Xianyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau. The office immediately arrested and interrogated bandit Li, who confessed to his crimes. That day, the resident office sent bandit Li to the County Public Security Bureau. The Public Security Bureau refused to take him into custody on the grounds of "no materials." The resident office had to take bandit Li back into custody. Due to the resident office's lax custody, bandit Li escaped on the morning of April 9th.

    After bandit Li escaped, the Xianyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau and the First Resident Office did not recognize the errors of their bureaucratic work style and paralyzing thoughts, and still mechanically emphasized the need for procedures and materials, forcing the masses of our county who captured the bandit to return. May I ask, is bandit Li's confession not material? Do the masses need procedures to report lurking spies?

    I believe that the bureaucratic work style of the Xianyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau and the paralyzing thoughts of the First Resident Office have caused serious losses in work. It is hoped that the Xianyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau will make a deep self-criticism of the above errors and give the relevant personnel due punishment.

### 对群众检举反革命的正义行动  陕西咸阳公安局竟不支持

　　对群众检举反革命的正义行动
    陕西咸阳公安局竟不支持编辑同志：
    陕西省咸阳县人民政府公安局不支持群众检举反革命分子的正义行动，致使已被捕获的反革命分子逃跑了。
    我县（河南正阳）反革命分子李子彬（化名好三），地主成份，曾任匪军营长、联保主任及军统特务组长。解放前，他曾杀害我干部及群众七人，并强奸妇女、迫害人民。解放后，该犯被政府捕获，经教育释放了。该犯竟又组织土匪三十余人，携带武器，假冒我县大队名义，到处烧杀抢掠。正阳县人民政府为了为民除害，曾两次通缉他。
    我县土地改革后，特别是在抗美援朝、镇压反革命的运动中，群众政治觉悟大为提高，自动协助政府逮捕反革命分子。四月初，我县一区群众两人获悉李匪在陕西咸阳县，即自动前往侦查。四月七日他们到达咸阳，弄清了李匪之潜伏地址后，即到咸阳县人民政府公安局第一分驻所报告。该所即将李匪逮捕审讯，李匪对其罪恶供认不讳。当日，分驻所即将李匪送交县公安局。公安局竟以“无材料”为理由拒绝收押。分驻所只得将李匪带回扣押。因分驻所押扣不严，四月九日清晨，李匪潜逃。
    李匪逃跑后，咸阳县人民政府公安局及第一分驻所还未认识其官僚主义作风及麻痹思想的错误，还机械地强调要手续与材料，强令我县捕匪之群众回去。试问李匪之口供是否是材料？群众检举潜伏特务是否用手续？
    我认为：咸阳县人民政府公安局的官僚主义作风及第一分驻所的麻痹思想，已造成工作上严重损失。希望咸阳县人民政府公安局对上述错误作深刻检讨，并给有关人员以应有的处分。
