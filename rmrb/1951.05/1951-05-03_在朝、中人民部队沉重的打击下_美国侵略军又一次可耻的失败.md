Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The powerful counter-offensive of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces has once again dealt a heavy blow to the boastful American invaders in Korea.

On April 11, after dismissing the defeated General MacArthur, U.S. President Truman announced in his speech that the United States would continue its war of aggression against Korea, and boasted: "If a new offensive comes, I am confident that it can be repelled." He appointed Ridgway to replace MacArthur, and sent Van Fleet, a executioner whose hands were stained with the blood of the Greek people, to be the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, directing the U.S. invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army to continue their reckless advance northward. On April 20, Van Fleet, on his first inspection of the front lines after taking office, also declared arrogantly that it was "doubtful whether the Korean and Chinese People's Forces would launch a large-scale offensive soon. If it comes, we will meet it head-on."

However, the front-line commanders of the American invading army, who had repeatedly suffered devastating blows from the Korean and Chinese People's Forces, were not as confident as these boasting generals. Brian, the commander of the U.S. 24th Division, revealed his inner anxiety when he met with a United Press reporter on the 20th. He said: "They (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Forces) will turn around and fight again, perhaps tonight, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps next month. They have the power to launch a full-scale offensive. The time, place, and manner are unknown." He said anxiously: "Their strategy is constantly changing. This is a question that I and people more capable than I are still exploring." He helplessly admitted that the American invading army could not deal with the heroic and battle-hardened Korean and Chinese People's Forces and could only "play it by ear and prepare for the worst."

After the Korean and Chinese People's Forces launched a counter-offensive on the 22nd, those Anglo-American reactionary news agencies that had originally boasted for the American invading army had to admit that the American invading army's hundred-mile defense line "collapsed rapidly in the raging waves of this powerful 'spring offensive.'" The brave Korean and Chinese People's Forces opened "a ten-mile-wide gap" in the American invading army's front, and "wave after wave passed through the breakthrough." As a result, "many battalions of the American invading army were isolated and cut off, traffic to the front was cut off, and a field artillery regiment and a mortar company were lost." Then, the "second wave" of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces' counter-attack "overwhelmed several divisions on the western front." Although the likes of Van Fleet repeatedly described the retreat of the American invading army as an "orderly retreat," the Associated Press admitted that "the swarming Communist forces repeatedly surrounded the United Nations forces -- American, British, Turkish, and Belgian troops." The Associated Press revealed that the American invading army and its accomplice troops suffered heavy losses under the blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces. For example, the British Royal Gloucestershire Regiment's First Battalion, as "one of the main forces on the Imjin River," was "almost completely annihilated. Out of a force of about one thousand men, only one hundred escaped." Some American invading army officers at the front said the situation was "serious," while others said the situation "looks bad for the allies."

### 在朝、中人民部队沉重的打击下  美国侵略军又一次可耻的失败

　　在朝、中人民部队沉重的打击下
    美国侵略军又一次可耻的失败
    【新华社三十日讯】朝、中人民部队的强大反击战，又一次地给了在朝鲜的惯于吹牛的美国侵略者以沉重打击。
    四月十一日，美国总统杜鲁门在把败军之将麦克阿瑟撤职后，曾在他的演说中宣布美国将继续进行侵朝战争，并大肆吹嘘说：“如果新的进攻到来，我深信必能予以击退”。他任命李奇微接替麦克阿瑟，派遣双手涂满希腊人民鲜血的刽子手范佛里特任美军第八军军长，指挥美国侵略军和李承晚伪军继续向北冒进。四月二十日，范佛里特在就任后首次视察前线归来时，也趾高气扬地夸口说：朝、中人民部队“是否不久即将发动一次大规模攻势，实属疑问。如果它来，我们将予以迎头痛击。”
    但是，曾经一再遭受到朝、中人民军队歼灭性打击的美国侵略军前线指挥官，却不像这些吹牛将军们那样自信。美军第二十四师师长布莱恩，在二十日接见合众社记者时，却透露了内心惶惑不安的情绪。他说：“他们（按指朝、中人民军队）将来会回转头来作战，时间也许在今晚，也许在明天，也许在下个月。他们有力量发动全面攻势。时间、地点和方式是一个未知数。”他烦恼地说：“他们的战略瞬息万变。这是我和比我能干的人还在摸索的问题。”并无可奈何地承认：美国侵略军无法对付英勇善战的朝、中人民军队，只能“见机行事，准备万一”。
    在朝、中人民部队二十二日起发动了反击战后，那些原来为美国侵略军吹嘘的英美反动通讯社，不能不承认：美国侵略军的一百英里防线，又迅速地在这一强大的“春季攻势的怒涛中崩溃了。”勇敢的朝、中人民军队在美国侵略军的阵线上打开了“一个十英里宽的缺口”，“一团接着一团穿过突破口”。于是，美国侵略军“有好些营人被孤立了与切断了，通往前线的交通被切断了，一个野战炮团和一个迫击炮连损失了。”接着，朝、中人民军队反击的“第二个浪头”，又“冲倒了西线上好几个师”。虽然范佛里特之流一再把美国侵略军的败退描写为“有秩序的撤退”，但美联社承认：“蜂涌而来的共方大军一再围住了联合国部队——美国、英国、土耳其、比利时的部队。”美联社透露，美国侵略军及其帮凶部队，在朝、中人民部队打击之下，损失甚为惨重。例如，作为“临津江上主要部队之一的英国皇家格罗斯忒群第一营”，“几乎全军覆没。在大约有一千人的这支兵力中，只有一百名逃生”。在前线的美国侵略军军官，有的说情况“严重”，有的说情势“对盟国来说，看来是很坏的”。
