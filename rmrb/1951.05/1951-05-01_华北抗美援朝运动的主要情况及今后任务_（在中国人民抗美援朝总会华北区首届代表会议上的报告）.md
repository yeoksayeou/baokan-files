　　Major Situation and Future Tasks of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement in North China
   (Report at the First Representative Meeting of the North China Region of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea)

Fellow Representatives:

At the suggestion of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea has decided to convene the North China Representative Meeting to Resist America and Aid Korea and establish the North China General Sub-Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, in order to uniformly lead the future patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea in North China. This meeting will summarize the work and experience of North China in resisting America and aiding Korea over the past five months, and determine future tasks. It is believed that after this meeting, the movement to resist America and aid Korea in North China will be pushed to a higher stage.

Our national movement to resist America and aid Korea, under the leadership of the General Committee and driven by the continuous victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, has made great achievements. The tide of the movement has surged and developed on an unprecedented scale, involving most people of all classes, nationalities, and occupations across the country. They have not only responded to the call of the General Committee with words and writings, but also demonstrated their patriotic enthusiasm with actions. The movement to resist America and aid Korea has been implemented in various tasks and has become a huge driving force for promoting people's progress and work development. Through these movements, the broad masses of people have gained a deeper understanding of the true face of American imperialism, making the anti-imperialist united front more consolidated and expanded. It has greatly changed the national inferiority complex caused by the semi-colonial status for nearly a century. The Chinese people have stood up heroically and have struck at the arrogance of American imperialism's aggression in front of the world's people, making the practical proof of the peace camp exceeding the power of the aggression camp; thus, promoting the internal division of the imperialist camp and the downfall of MacArthur; greatly raising the international status of the Chinese people.

Under the leadership of the General Committee, our North China movement to resist America and aid Korea, since its start last November, has combined various large and small gatherings, winter school education, accusation and recollection, demonstrations and parades, donations and condolences, signature voting, and the signing of patriotic covenants, especially during the Spring Festival, "February 7th," "March 8th," and preparations for welcoming the "May 1st" movement, with propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea. In this work, North China, led by Beijing and Tianjin, has involved cities, villages, factories, schools, all sectors, all industries, and all ethnic groups in this movement. In factories, workers launched patriotic production competitions; farmers enthusiastically carried out bumper harvest movements; students organized propaganda teams to carry out propaganda work to the masses; the industrial and commercial sectors held demonstrations, enthusiastically paid patriotic taxes, and helped stabilize prices; the medical community voluntarily organized medical teams to go to the front lines for medical work; the reform movement in the religious community, as well as the improved performances of old artists, etc.; enabled many people who had never been concerned about current affairs to participate in the movement; reversing the old historical situation. According to surveys, in Beijing, 90 percent of students and 80 percent of workers and suburban farmers have received education on resisting America and aiding Korea. In Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, 72 percent of the 1.8 million people in seventeen counties and one town participated in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and received education on resisting America and aiding Korea. In short, on average, 70 to 80 percent of people in North China have received education on resisting America and aiding Korea. In terms of mobilizing propaganda forces, during the Spring Festival, five prefectures in Hebei, including Tangshan, Baoding, Tianjin, Dingxian, and Handan, mobilized more than 154,000 teachers, students, Communist Party members, and intellectuals in the countryside for propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea. This has given the North China movement to resist America and aid Korea an unprecedentedly large scale. As of now, the movement to resist America and aid Korea in North China has basically become popular. With the promotion of this "May 1st" movement, the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in the entire North China region will have greater development; however, the movement is not balanced and in-depth; this is mainly due to the fact that a few leading organs do not pay enough attention to it. It must be understood that American imperialism is still occupying our country's Taiwan, and the Korean War is still in a difficult and tense stage. American imperialism has not only failed to learn from past failures, but is willingly violating international treaties and attempting to rearm Japan as a tool for carrying out aggression. Therefore, in order to completely defeat the enemy, to completely eliminate the influence of American imperialism in China, and to further advance our work in all aspects, based on the current situation, the instructions of the General Committee, and the specific situation in North China, the tasks of the North China movement to resist America and aid Korea in the future should be the following:

    (1) The current movement to resist America and aid Korea must focus on supporting the just war of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, opposing the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism, and supporting the resolutions and declarations of the World Peace Council, and the universal signing of patriotic covenants, in order to promote the people's patriotic ideology, expose the conspiracy of American imperialism to expand its war of aggression, continuously improve the understanding of the essence of American imperialism, consolidate and expand the anti-American patriotic united front, and closely integrate it with specific tasks such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries and the production movement, making it a driving force for various tasks.

    (2) Vigorously promote and prepare for the current "May 1st" patriotic demonstration movement, universally hold signatures in support of the conclusion of peace covenants and voting on the Japanese issue, so that every place and every person can receive education on resisting America and aiding Korea, so that every educated person can gain something politically and ideologically.

    (3) After "May 1st," the North China movement to resist America and aid Korea should enter a stage of in-depth consolidation. In individual places where it has not been popularized, it should be popularized in in-depth work, using the launch of accusations, recollections, and the establishment of martyrs' memorial rooms, etc., to compare the past and the present, in order to enlighten the masses' anti-American and patriotic thinking; then, on the basis of ideological awareness, sign patriotic covenants. Those who have signed should regularly check the implementation of the covenants, and then consolidate the movement to resist America and aid Korea from the results of the implementation.

    (4) Anti-American and Aid-Korea sub-committees should be established above the county level to strengthen the leadership of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement; such a large political movement must have a certain organizational structure and strength to guarantee it. Therefore, regions that have not yet established sub-committees should quickly establish them; regions that have established sub-committees should enrich the work of the sub-committees.

　　华北抗美援朝运动的主要情况及今后任务
   （在中国人民抗美援朝总会华北区首届代表会议上的报告）
    聂真各位代表：
    经中共中央华北局提议，中国人民抗美援朝总会决定召开华北抗美援朝代表会议，成立华北抗美援朝总分会，以统一领导华北今后的抗美援朝爱国主义运动，并要在这次会议上总结华北五个月来抗美援朝的工作和经验；确定今后的任务；相信这次会议后，定会将华北的抗美援朝运动推向一个更高的阶段。
    我们全国的抗美援朝运动，在总会领导之下，在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军不断胜利的推动下，已取得很大成绩，其运动浪潮已汹涌澎湃地发展起来，其运动规模，空前巨大；使全国各阶层各民族各种职业的人民大部都卷入了运动的行列。他们不仅以言语、文字来响应总会的号召，而且以行动来表现自己的爱国热忱。抗美援朝运动已贯彻在各种工作上，已成为推动人民进步，推动工作发展的巨大动力。经过了这些运动，广大人民对美帝国主义的真面目有了更深刻的认识；使反帝统一战线更加巩固和扩大。使近百年来由于半殖民地地位所造成的民族自卑心理，得到极大的改变。中国人民已是英勇地站起来了，中国人民已在世界人民面前打击了美帝国主义的侵略气焰，使和平阵营超过侵略阵营的力量得到实践的证明；因而，促进帝国主义阵营内部的分裂，和麦克阿瑟的下台；使中国人民的国际地位大大的提高。
    在总会领导下，我们华北的抗美援朝运动，自去年十一月开始，经过各种大小集会、冬学教育、控诉回忆、示威游行、捐献慰劳、签名投票及订立爱国公约，特别是经过春节，“二七”，“三八”，及迎接“五一”运动准备工作的时候，都结合着进行了抗美援朝的宣传教育，在这一工作上，全华北以北京、天津为首，无论城市、乡村、工厂、学校、各界、各业、各民族都卷入了这一运动。在工厂中，工人展开了爱国主义生产竞赛；农民则热烈地开展了丰产运动；学生则组织宣传队向群众进行宣传工作；工商界的示威游行，踊跃缴纳爱国捐税，帮助稳定物价；医务界自动组织医疗队赴前线进行医疗工作；宗教界的革新运动，以及旧艺人的改良表演等；使过去一向不问时事的人，有许多人参加了运动；一反历史上旧有的情况。根据调查：北京市受过抗美援朝教育的人，在学生中已有百分之九十，在工人和郊区农民中已有百分之八十。山西运城专区十七个县一个镇一百八十万人中，参加抗美援朝运动和受到抗美援朝教育的，即达百分之七十二。总之，全华北平均起来说，受过抗美援朝教育的已达百分之七十到八十。在动员宣传力量上说，如河北唐山、保定、天津、定县、邯郸五个专区，春节期间的抗美援朝宣传，即动员了教师、学生、共产党员、在乡知识分子十五万四千多人。这样，就使华北的抗美援朝运动，具有了空前巨大的规模；截至目前为止，华北的抗美援朝运动基本上已经普及起来，经过这次“五一”运动的推动，华北全区的抗美援朝工作会有一个更大的发展；但，运动表现的还不平衡与不深入；这主要由于少数领导机关对此还不很重视。必须了解美帝国主义还正在侵占着我国台湾，朝鲜战争也还正在艰苦紧张的阶段，而美帝国主义不但未接受过去失败的教训，反甘心违背国际条约，企图重新武装日本，来作为其进行侵略的工具；因此，我们为了彻底击败敌人，为了将美帝国主义在华的影响彻底肃清，为了将我们各方面的工作更向前推进一步，根据目前形势和总会指示与华北的具体情况，今后华北抗美援朝运动的任务应该是以下几点：
    （一）目前的抗美援朝运动，必须以支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的正义战争，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，拥护世界和平理事会的决议和宣言，普遍订立爱国公约为中心内容，以发扬人民的爱国主义思想，揭破美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，不断提高对美帝国主义本质的认识，巩固与扩大反美爱国统一战线，并与镇压反革命、生产运动等具体工作，密切地结合起来，使之成为各种工作的推动力。
    （二）大力推动和准备目前的“五一”爱国主义示威运动，普遍举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名和对日本问题的投票，做到每地每人都能受到抗美援朝的教育，使每一个受教育的人在政治上、思想上皆能有所收获。
    （三）“五一”以后，华北的抗美援朝运动，应走上深入巩固的阶段，对个别未普及的地方，应在深入工作中普及之，用发动控诉、回忆、建立烈士纪念室等，对比过去和现在，以启发群众的仇美爱国思想；然后在思想觉悟的基础上，订立爱国公约。已订立者，应经常检查公约的执行，再从执行的成果中去巩固抗美援朝运动。
    （四）要在县以上成立抗美援朝分会，以加强对抗美援朝运动的领导；这样大的一个政治运动，必须有一定的组织机构和力量来保证。所以目前尚未成立分会的地区，应迅速成立；已成立分会的地区，要充实分会的工作。
