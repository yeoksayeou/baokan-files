　　Li Shunda Publishes "May Day" Thoughts

　　Calls on Peasants to Learn from Workers, Resist America and Aid Korea, and Launch Patriotic Production Competition.

　　Shanxi Province agricultural labor model Li Shunda, published his thoughts on "May Day" saying: The great "May Day" is the festival of the worker elder brothers, and also the festival of us peasant brothers, we enthusiastically hold meetings to celebrate, and even more should celebrate with practical actions. I believe: First, peasant brothers should learn from the worker elder brothers, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and unite the people of the whole country. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, we peasants should take the lead with the workers to shoulder the burden of building a new China. Second, peasant brothers across the country must resolutely oppose the heinous crimes of American imperialism in disrupting world peace, launching wars of aggression, and rearming Japan. American imperialism is killing, setting fires, raping women, and harming children in Korea, and also sending planes to bomb our Northeast, and reconnaissance and strafing in Fujian Province, this is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. Peasant brothers across the country must aid the Korean people, support the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and thoroughly eliminate the American invading army. Third, peasant brothers across the country should enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call, launch a patriotic production competition, improve technology on the basis of organization, produce more grain, become prosperous, and consolidate national defense; and must resolutely implement the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, and protect our fruits of liberation and good times.

　　李顺达发表“五一”节感想
    号召农民向工人学习，抗美援朝，开展爱国生产竞赛。
    山西省农业劳动模范李顺达，在“五一”节发表感想说：伟大的“五一”节，是工人老大哥的节日，也是我们农民兄弟的节日，我们热烈地开会来庆祝，更要用实际行动庆祝。我认为：第一、农民兄弟应向工人老大哥学习，巩固工农联盟，团结全国人民。在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，我们农民应和工人带头担起建设新中国的担子。第二、全国农民弟兄，要坚决反对美帝国主义破坏世界和平、发动侵略战争、重新武装日本的罪恶行为。美帝国主义在朝鲜杀人放火、强奸妇女、残害儿童，并且派飞机轰炸我国东北，在福建省侦察、扫射，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。全国农民兄弟一定要援助朝鲜人民，支援朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军，彻底消灭美国侵略军。第三、全国农民弟兄应热烈响应毛主席的号召，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，在组织起来的基础上，提高技术，多打粮食，发家致富，巩固国防；并要坚决执行惩治反革命条例，协助政府镇压反革命分子，保卫咱们的翻身果实和好时光。
