　　Beijing's Experience in Launching the Ma Hengchang Team Competition Movement
　　Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

Since the launch of the Ma Hengchang team competition movement in Beijing, great achievements have been made. From January to March 16th this year, 1,008 teams across the city have responded to the Ma Hengchang team's challenge; among them, 59 teams are composed of technical personnel and staff. In larger state-owned factories and mines, approximately 65% of the employees have been involved in this movement. Many shop assistants, handicraft workers, porters, and medical workers have also enthusiastically participated in this movement, with 21 porter teams responding to the Ma Hengchang team's challenge.

The current patriotic labor competition movement in Beijing is more extensive than any previous competition movement. The main reason is that the patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country has further enhanced the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff. Therefore, this labor competition movement in Beijing has presented several notable features not seen in previous competitions:

First, workers and staff generally value current affairs study and have universally established a newspaper reading system. After joining the challenge, the Xu Zhaoyu team of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant established a newspaper reading system, dedicating 20 to 30 minutes each day by arriving early or leaving late. This has made everyone's study of current affairs issues more enthusiastic. Experience has proven that adhering to the newspaper reading system is an effective method for studying current affairs. With this system, patriotic education to Resist America and Aid Korea can be carried out in a timely manner, and the results of the study can be used to improve production and work in a timely manner.

Second, emphasis is placed on technical learning, and technical mutual aid groups and technical research associations have been established within the teams. Many teams have signed apprenticeship contracts, driving and uniting veteran technical workers; some teams consult with technical personnel when studying technology, which further unites the technical personnel. For example, in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, veteran technicians from the Yang Kui team signed apprenticeship contracts with engineers to further improve their skills. The Zhang Fengquan team of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory transformed the conservative thinking of veteran technicians, enabling the team to create three new tools and improve eight tools continuously, completing production tasks ahead of schedule each month. Combining the workers' labor enthusiasm with technical research, many teams have put forward rationalization proposals for improving tools, adjusting labor organization, and so on, during the movement.

Third, the challenge conditions and team plans are more practical and feasible than before. Many teams have established many systems after accepting the challenge to ensure the realization of the competition conditions. In the past, some teams' plans in labor competitions were not specific; some teams' competition plans contained many articles, encompassing everything, and were very impractical; some teams' plans were slogan-like, such as "complete production tasks ahead of schedule," "improve quality, reduce costs," etc.; these plans were difficult to check after they were made and could not be sustained. In this competition movement, most teams have proposed clear and specific goals, thought out practical and feasible methods, such as establishing a specialized responsibility system with a clear division of labor and various production record systems, establishing production review meetings and brainstorming sessions, and so on. These methods and systems have played a guaranteeing role in timely inspection of work, correction of shortcomings, and consolidation of competition results.

In the past two and a half months, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has summarized the following experiences in leading the labor competition movement:

It is necessary to make every trade union cadre clearly realize that the Ma Hengchang team competition movement is the continued deepening and improvement of the patriotic labor competition. At the beginning, some trade union cadres in Beijing believed that "it is enough to carry out the patriotic labor competition, and there is no need for another Ma Hengchang team competition." Obviously, this separates the Ma Hengchang team competition from the patriotic labor competition. The team is the cell of production organization and trade union organization, and any administrative and trade union plans must be implemented through the team. Therefore, strengthening team work, and then organizing workshop and factory-wide labor competitions, is an important method of organizing labor competitions. Therefore, grassroots trade union organizations must be good at guiding this mass movement and helping teams that have already responded to the Ma Hengchang team's challenge to fulfill their competition conditions. Some trade union cadres also believe that "doing a good job in a few teams will not have a great effect on the overall production." This idea is also one-sided. The purpose of launching the Ma Hengchang team competition movement is not just to do a good job in a few teams, but to improve the production work and trade union work of the entire workshop and the entire factory through the leading role of advanced teams, so that all workers, staff, and technical personnel can learn from the advanced, thereby deeply carrying out the patriotic labor competition movement. Therefore, clearing the cadres' minds and strengthening the trade union's leadership over the competition movement is an important link in ensuring the in-depth and steady development of the movement.

Timely summarizing work and popularizing experience is an effective working method for leading the competition movement. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a representative meeting of teams across the city that responded to the Ma Hengchang team's challenge on March 25th and 26th. After participating in this representative meeting, some representatives said, "Now I have a way to lead the teams when I go back." Through this meeting, the competition movement in Beijing was deepened another step, making this spontaneous mass movement develop under leadership. Moreover, this kind of meeting is also a good way to improve the leadership ability of team leaders and grassroots trade union organizations. Not only can this kind of meeting be held in the city at an appropriate working stage, but also in an industry or a factory, this kind of meeting can be held frequently to summarize and promote the experience of the masses at any time.

It is necessary to be good at combining the Ma Hengchang team competition movement with other current central tasks. The trade union leadership of many factories in Beijing is not doing this work well enough. They said, "The work is very busy. We have to carry out patriotic education to Resist America and Aid Korea, and we have to prepare for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations. We don't have time to carry out the competition movement." However, the experience of some factories in Beijing has proven that an advanced production team must be an advanced and sound trade union team; it must be a team with a higher level of political consciousness. Such a team is not only an advanced producer, but also a leading completer of the current central tasks.

In the labor competition, attention should be paid to uniting technical personnel, carrying out the rationalization proposal movement, and improving unreasonable labor organization and working methods. Workers should be encouraged to actively unite technical personnel, and at the same time, technical personnel should be mobilized to actively go to the work site to understand the workers' actual operation situation and improve unscientific operation methods. In this way, the workers' labor operation will have theoretical guidance; the technical personnel's theory can also be further improved in practice. The Liu Dezhen team of the Shijingshan Power Plant learned to use formulas for calculation by uniting technical personnel when overhauling the No. 6 generator, and found the center in two days (it took 11 days during the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, and the shortest time after liberation was 5 days). Many vivid examples of workers and technical personnel uniting and helping each other tell us that strengthening the unity of technical personnel and workers, improving technology, and improving operation methods are the key to the normal development and consolidation of the competition.

The trade union should always care about the workers' lives and solve difficulties for the masses. In particular, the phenomenon of working overtime should be avoided in the competition. This time, many teams that responded to the Ma Hengchang team's challenge have organized mutual aid societies to solve the living difficulties of their workmates. Grassroots trade union organizations should strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid societies and establish workshop mutual aid societies (or factory-wide mutual aid societies if conditions permit) on the basis of the masses' conscious willingness. The trade union should also regularly urge the administration or the capitalist to inspect safety and health equipment and pay attention to the workers' meals. In addition, the trade union must supervise the administration or the capitalist to give timely and appropriate rewards to the workers to stimulate their labor enthusiasm.

Strengthening patriotic education to Resist America and Aid Korea and continuously improving the workers' class consciousness and political understanding is a guarantee for deeply carrying out the patriotic labor competition. The experience of Beijing has proven that strengthening the leadership of newspaper reading work is an important method for making the workers' current affairs study regular. Combining current affairs with propaganda and mobilization work and disseminating advanced experience is also an important method for encouraging the masses' production enthusiasm. Cartoons and vivid production charts that promote production are most popular with the masses.

If the above issues can be paid attention to and implemented by grassroots trade union organizations or workshop trade union committees, the patriotic labor competition can be made regular and lasting through the Ma Hengchang team competition movement.

　　北京市开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动的经验
    北京市总工会副主席  刘莱夫
    北京市自开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动以来，已获得很大成绩。从今年一月到三月十六日止，全市向马恒昌小组应战的小组已有一千零八个；其中有五十九个小组是技术人员和职员组成的。较大的公营厂矿中，已有百分之六十五左右的职工卷入这个运动。若干店员、手工业工人、搬运工人、医务工作者也踊跃地参加了这一运动，搬运工人小组向马恒昌小组应战的已达二十一个组。
    北京市目前开展的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，其规模比过去任何一次竞赛运动都要广泛。主要原因是抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动，进一步提高了广大职工的爱国热情。所以，北京市这次劳动竞赛运动，就出现了以前竞赛中所没有的几个显著特点：
    首先，是职工群众一般都重视了时事学习，普遍建立了读报制度。石景山钢铁厂徐兆瑜小组，参加应战以后，建立了读报制度，以每天早来或晚走二十到三十分钟的时间进行读报。这就使大家对时事问题学习得更热烈了。经验证明：坚持读报制度是学习时事的有效方法。有了这种制度，就可以及时地进行抗美援朝的爱国教育，并及时地以学习成果，提高生产工作。
    其次，重视了技术学习，在小组中建立了技术互助组、技术研究会等。许多小组订立了师徒合同，带动和团结了老技术工人；有的小组研究技术时，向技术人员请教，这就进一步团结了技术人员。像石景山钢铁厂的杨奎小组，老技工为了进一步提高技术，和工程师订立师徒合同。华北农业机械总厂张凤泉小组，改造了老技工的技术保守思想，使该组连续创造三种新工具，改进了八种工具，每月提前完成生产任务。职工的劳动热情和钻研技术结合起来，许多小组在运动中提出了改进工具、调整劳动组织等等的合理化建议。
    其三，应战条件和小组计划较以前订得切实可行。不少小组应战后，建立了许多制度，保证实现竞赛条件。过去，若干小组在劳动竞赛中，计划订得不具体；有些小组的竞赛计划条文很多，包罗万象，很不实际；有些小组的计划是口号式的，如：“提前完成生产任务”，“提高质量，减低成本”等；这些计划，订了以后不易检查，亦不能坚持，这次竞赛运动中，绝大部分小组的计划都提出了明确、具体的目标，想出了切实可行的办法，如建立明确分工的专责制和各种生产纪录制度，建立生产检讨会和碰头会等等。这些办法和制度，在及时检查工作，纠正缺点，巩固竞赛成果上，起了保证作用。
    两个半月来，北京市总工会领导劳动竞赛运动，总结了以下几点经验：
    必须使每个工会干部明确认识：马恒昌小组竞赛运动，就是爱国主义劳动竞赛的继续深入和提高。开始时，北京曾有些工会干部认为：“开展爱国主义劳动竞赛就够了，不要再来个马恒昌小组竞赛了。”显然，这是把马恒昌小组竞赛与爱国主义劳动竞赛分开了的。小组是生产组织与工会组织的细胞，行政和工会的任何计划，都必须通过小组才能贯彻。因此，加强小组工作，进而组织车间与全厂性的劳动竞赛，是组织劳动竞赛的重要方法。因此，工会基层组织必须善于引导这个群众运动，帮助已经向马恒昌小组应战的小组，完成他们的竞赛条件。也有的工会干部认为：“光搞好几个小组，对整个生产起的作用不大。”这个想法也是片面的。开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动的目的，决不只是为了把几个小组搞好，而是通过先进小组的带头作用，把整个车间、整个工厂的生产工作和工会工作搞好，使全体工人、职员、技术人员，都向先进者学习，从而深入地开展爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。因此，打通干部思想，加强工会对竞赛运动的领导，是保证运动深入与稳步发展的重要环节。
    及时总结工作，推广经验，是领导竞赛运动的有效工作方法。北京市总工会在三月二十五、二十六两日，曾召开了全市向马恒昌小组应战的小组代表会议。参加这次代表会议后，有的代表说：“这次回去领导小组可有办法了。”通过这次会议，使北京的竞赛运动又深入了一步，使这一自发性的群众运动，走向有领导的发展。而且，这种会议又是提高小组长和工会基层组织领导能力的好办法。不但全市在一个适当的工作阶段可以召开这种会议，在一个产业或一个工厂中，都可以经常召开这种会议，随时总结推广群众的经验。
    要善于把马恒昌小组竞赛运动和当前的其他中心工作结合起来。这一工作，北京不少工厂的工会领导上还做的不好。他们说：“工作很忙，又要进行抗美援朝时事教育，又要做实施劳动保险条例的准备工作，没工夫开展竞赛运动。”但北京有些厂的经验证明：一个先进的生产小组，必定是一个先进的健全的工会小组；必定是一个政治觉悟较高的小组。这样的小组是生产先进者，也是当前中心工作的带头完成者。
    在劳动竞赛中，要注意团结技术人员，开展合理化建议运动，改善不合理的劳动组织和工作方法。要使工人主动团结技术人员，同时发动技术人员主动下现场，了解工人实地操作情况，改进不科学的操作方法。这样，工人的劳动操作就有了理论的指导；技术人员的理论也能在实践中得到进一步的提高。石景山发电厂刘德珍小组在检修六号发电机中，由于团结了技术人员，学会了用公式计算，两天找到了中心（国民党匪帮统治时期要十一天，解放后最短也要五天）。不少工人与技术人员团结互助的生动例子告诉我们：加强技术人员与工人的团结，提高技术，改进操作方法，是使竞赛正常发展和巩固的关键。
    工会应该经常关心职工生活，为群众解决困难。特别是在竞赛中要避免加班加点现象。这次许多向马恒昌小组应战的小组，都组织了互助会来解决工友们的生活困难。工会基层组织应加强对互助会的领导，并在群众自觉自愿的基础上成立车间的互助会（有条件也可以成立全厂性的）。工会还应该经常督促行政或资方，检查安全与卫生设备，注意职工的伙食。另外，工会必须监督行政或资方对工友进行及时与适当的奖励，以刺激工友们的劳动热情。
    加强抗美援朝时事教育，不断提高职工的阶级觉悟和政治认识，是深入开展爱国主义劳动竞赛的保证。北京市的经验证明：加强对读报工作的领导，是使职工的时事学习经常化的重要方法。结合时事进行宣传鼓动工作，传播先进经验，也是鼓舞群众生产情绪的重要方法。鼓动生产的漫画与鲜明的生产图表，最为群众所欢迎。
    上述问题如果能被工会基层组织或车间工会委员会注意执行，就能通过马恒昌小组竞赛运动，使爱国主义劳动竞赛经常持久下去。
