Responding to the challenge from mutual aid groups in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province

The Song Luoxue Mutual Aid Group in Mancheng County, Hebei Province
Actively participates in the summer harvest and summer seed selection competition

    The Song Luoxue mutual aid group in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, headed by labor model Song Luoxue, responded to the call of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government and accepted the patriotic production challenge of the forty-seven mutual aid groups in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, regarding the summer harvest and summer seed selection. After Song Luoxue saw the challenge message from the forty-seven mutual aid groups in Xingping County in the newspaper, he immediately convened a meeting of all members of the group to discuss it. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that in order for the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea to be able to eat new wheat as soon as possible, and in order for their own labor fruits to be harvested satisfactorily, they should actively accept the challenge. The conditions proposed by the group for accepting the challenge are: to ensure that the group's wheat fields are harvested on time, and to achieve clean fields in both high and low-lying wheat fields within seven and five days respectively. In terms of seed selection, field selection of wheat seeds will be implemented (removing diseased plants, mixed ears, and inferior ears in the wheat fields prepared for seed selection, leaving pure wheat, and selecting a piece for single harvest and single threshing), and ear selection on the threshing ground (selecting excellent wheat ears on the threshing ground). The excellent "72" wheat variety, which is resistant to wind and disease, will be threshed, dried, and stored separately.

    In order to ensure the timely and smooth completion of the wheat harvest, the group proposed the following specific measures: (1) Complete cotton weeding, yam watering and other work before the wheat harvest. The threshing ground should be rolled three days before the wheat harvest. (Harvesting tools are now fully prepared.) (2) All nineteen adult men and women in the group will participate in the wheat harvest, and the specific division of labor will be based on the strength of the labor force. (3) In order to prevent theft and sabotage by bandits and special agents, in addition to the village militia patrolling and protecting the wheat, the group members will take turns guarding the wheat day and night. To prevent wind and rain damage, harvest one piece as it ripens, and strive for early threshing, early drying, and early storage. And before putting it into the granary, expose the wheat grains to strong sunlight once to prevent diseases and insect pests.

    In addition, the group also proposed to actively participate in the village-wide competition of comparing harvests and comparing seeds, and to specifically help the twenty households who have not participated in the mutual aid group to complete all seed selection, so as to further develop the patriotic and high-yield movement in the village. And ensure that the wheat requisition task is completed within five days, and the wheat delivered for public grain should all be dry and clean.

　　响应陕西兴平县各互助组挑战
    河北满城宋洛学互助组
    积极参加夏收夏选竞赛
    河北省满城县劳动模范宋洛学的互助组响应中央农业部的号召，对陕西兴平县四十七个互助组的夏收夏选爱国生产挑战提出应战。宋洛学在报纸上看到兴平县四十七个互助组的挑战消息后，当即召集该组全体组员开会讨论。讨论中，大家一致认为为了使在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军能够早日吃到新麦，为了自己的劳动果实能够圆满收获，应当积极应战。该组提出的应战条件是：保证全组麦田按时完成收割，高地、洼地麦田分别在七天和五天内做到场光地净。在选种方面，实行麦种田间片选（在预备选种的麦地里拔去病株、杂穗、劣穗，留下纯麦，挑一片单收单打），场上穗选（在场里挑出优良麦穗）。对能抗风抗病的优良品种“七二”小麦，实行单打、单晒、单存。
    为保证按时顺利完成麦收，该组提出以下几项具体办法：（一）将锄棉、浇山药等工作赶在麦收前作完。打麦场要在麦收前三天碾好。（收获用的农具现已准备齐全。）（二）全组十九个成年男女全部参加麦收，按劳动力的强弱具体分工。（三）为防止土匪特务偷盗、破坏，除由本村民兵巡逻护麦外，本组组员昼夜轮流守麦。为防风雨侵害，实行熟一片，收一片，做到早打、早晒、早藏。并在入囤前将麦粒在强烈的阳光下暴晒一次，以防病虫害。
    此外，该组并提出积极参加全村的比收成，比种籽的竞赛，具体帮助二十户未参加互助组的农户作到全部选种，使本村的爱国丰产运动进一步开展起来。并保证在五天内完成麦征任务，交公粮的麦子要全部交干的和净的。
