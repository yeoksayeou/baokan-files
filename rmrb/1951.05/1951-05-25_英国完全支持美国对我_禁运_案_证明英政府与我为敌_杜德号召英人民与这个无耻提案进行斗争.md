Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: Since US imperialism has been coercing its satellite countries within and outside the United Nations to implement a so-called "embargo" against China, the attitude taken by Britain on this issue fully demonstrates that the Labour government completely supports the US aggression against China and takes a hostile stance against the Chinese people.

First, on April 9, the British government announced controls on rubber exports. Then, on May 3, British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons: "From now on, his strategic material export policy will be completely consistent with the United States, not only in terms of rubber but also in other aspects." On May 7, the British government instructed Jebb, the British representative to the United Nations, not to oppose the US proposal when the illegal so-called "Special Collective Measures Committee" discussed the US "embargo" proposal. On May 10, the British Trade Secretary, Shawcross, announced in the House of Commons the complete cessation of rubber exports to China and expressed full support for the US embargo recommendation. On May 15, Jebb shamelessly stated at the New York Bar Association: "The British government has come to the conclusion that there is no benefit in not implementing the embargo recommendation." He tried his best to express the British government's full support for all steps taken by the United States to invade China and North Korea, saying that Britain "stands wholeheartedly with the United States and is willing to do everything possible to assist this overall effort, even if it means a reduction in the British standard of living." Finally, on May 17th and 18th, with the assistance of Britain, the United States manipulated the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly and the UN General Assembly plenary session to illegally pass resolutions to impose an embargo on China. Jebb shamelessly stated again during the vote on the 17th: "Since the Mediation Committee (note: this was illegally established by the United States manipulating the UN General Assembly) cannot accomplish anything, Britain has no other choice but to adopt the necessary consequences of the resolution passed on February 1st (note: referring to the shameful resolution of the UN General Assembly that slandered China as an aggressor)." All of this proves that the Labour government is completely the most submissive slave and the most shameless accomplice of the United States.

Pollitt, Vice Chairman of the British Communist Party, wrote an article in the London "Daily Worker" on the 12th, denouncing the illegal "embargo," pointing out that the embargo "is a war measure." Pollitt pointed out: "The policy of the United States is to drag Britain into a war against China, regardless of British interests and the wishes of the British people," and "the British government has succumbed to the United States' crude demands." Pollitt proposed that the British people "must fight against this shameless proposal to impose a blockade on China; the interests of the British people require peaceful coexistence and friendship with the Chinese people."

　　英国完全支持美国对我“禁运”案
    证明英政府与我为敌
    杜德号召英人民与这个无耻提案进行斗争
    【新华社二十三日讯】自从美帝国主义在联合国内外要挟各仆从国家对中国实行所谓“禁运”以来，英国在这个问题上所采取的态度，充分证明了工党政府完全支持美国侵略中国、与中国人民为敌的立场。
    首先是英国政府在四月九日宣布了对橡胶输出的管制。接着，五月三日，英国首相艾德礼就在下院表示：“从现在起，他的战略原料输出政策，不仅在橡胶方面要与美国完全一致，而且在其他方面也要和美国完全一致。”五月七日，英国政府就训令英国驻联合国代表杰伯，在非法的所谓“特别集体措施委员会”讨论美国的“禁运”提案时，不要反对美国提案。五月十日，英国贸易大臣萧克劳斯又在下院宣布完全停止输出橡胶至中国。并表示完全支持美国的禁运建议。五月十五日，杰伯在纽约律师协会上无耻地表白：“英国政府已认为不实行禁运建议不会有什么好处。”他竭力表示英国政府完全支持美国侵略中朝两国的各项步骤说：英国“全心全意地与美国站在一起，并且愿意尽一切可能来协助这个总的努力，即使这意味着英国的生活水平要有所降低也在所不惜。”最后，在五月十七、十八日，美国就在英国的协助下，操纵联合国大会政治委员会与联合国大会全体会议先后非法地通过了对中国实行禁运的决议。杰伯在十七日投票时，再次无耻地声明：“既然斡旋委员会（按这是美国操纵联合国大会非法成立的）不能完成什么事，英国没有别的选择，只有采纳作为二月一日所通过的决议（按指联合国大会诬蔑中国为侵略者的可耻决议）的必然后果的办法。”所有这一切都证明了工党政府完全是美国最卑顺的奴仆和最无耻的帮凶。
    英国共产党副主席杜德十二日在伦敦《工人日报》撰文斥责非法的“禁运”时指出：禁运“是一种战争措施”。杜德指出：“美国的政策是不顾英国利益和英国人民的愿望把英国拖入对中国的战争的政策”，而“英国政府竟向美国粗暴的要求屈服。”杜德提出英国人民“必须与这个要求对中国实施封锁的无耻提案进行斗争；英国人民的利益要求与中国人民和平共处和友好”。
