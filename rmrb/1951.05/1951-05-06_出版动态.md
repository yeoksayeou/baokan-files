Publication Dynamics

*People's Education* Calls for Running National Education Journals Well

*People's Education* was founded on May 1st of last year and has already published two volumes. Starting with the first issue of Volume 3, according to the decision of the Central Ministry of Education to adjust national education journals, it has been clearly designated as the official publication of the Central Ministry of Education, responsible for guiding national education work ideologically and politically, and for guiding and helping to run national education journals well. In the future, the main content of *People's Education* will focus on policy interpretation, summarizing and introducing important experiences in education work, research in educational science, criticism of educational thought and education work, and introducing Soviet education experience. It will be a powerful weapon for the policy and ideological leadership of the Central Ministry of Education. Its target audience is education administrators at all levels and education workers and education researchers at all levels, excluding rural primary school teachers.

The first issue of Volume 3 published an editorial entitled *Striving to Run Education Journals Well is Our Major Task*, and an article entitled *Opinions on the Publication and Adjustment of National Education Journals* (excerpted in this issue), reviewing the editorial work of *People's Education* in the past year and the shortcomings of national education journals. It calls on national education leading organs and editorial departments of various education journals to run their own journals well. This call should be taken seriously.

Accepting Experience from Failure

This journal's Publication Dynamics column on the 13th reported that the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Working Committee of the Communist Youth League had compiled and printed a set of *Youth Current Affairs Booklets* in a folk format, which sold very well. They had previously experienced failure. In September of last year, they had also compiled and printed two booklets, each collecting a dozen or twenty large articles, printed in a 32-page format, each with more than one hundred pages. Each of these two books was printed in five thousand copies, and it was difficult to sell them. The reason was that the content was not popular, the articles were long, and the booklets were thick, so district and township cadres and the masses could not understand them and were unwilling to read them, and they could not be distributed. In January of this year, after examining these circumstances, it was decided to adopt the editorial policy of popular, short, and folk-style editing, facing the vast number of district and township cadres and members of the Communist Youth League and youth masses in rural areas, and another set of current affairs books was compiled. Because this set of series strengthened locality and popularity, and met the requirements and standards of the masses; and the booklets were small (48-page) and the price was low (priced at 300 yuan per book), the result of the distribution was unexpectedly welcomed by the masses. A total of 250,000 copies of the five types were printed, and all of them have been sold out. A farmer correspondent wrote to them saying: "Those small booklets are easy to understand and can help publicize current affairs. Everyone in the village likes to read them, and they are cheap. Two eggs or a bowl of corn can buy a copy. You should print more, and the people below are still scrambling for them."

This shows that only truly local and popular publications can truly be welcomed by the masses. This also shows that it is very important to accept experience and lessons from failure.

Recommendation of *Experience in Establishing a Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region*

The article *Experience in Establishing a Propaganda Network in the Northeast Region* by Fu Zhensheng has been printed as a separate book by the People's Publishing House. This article describes in detail the various aspects and experiences of the propaganda network in the entire Northeast region: the process of establishing the propaganda network in the Northeast region, the role of the propaganda network in various tasks, the content, form, and methods of propaganda, the basic experience of establishing the propaganda network in the past year; and points out how to improve in the future. It can be used as a reference for party organizations at all levels when establishing, consolidating, and improving the propaganda network, and can also be used by reporters and propagandists in various places for study. We hope that more books will appear that explain certain aspects of experience in propaganda work, so as to further improve and enhance propaganda work.

Northeast Publishing Houses Begin to Publish Comic Books

According to the masses' reflections that comic books from the interior are expensive, not timely, and few are combined with the specific situation in the Northeast, publishing houses in Northeast China have now begun to pay attention to the publication of comic books. Recently, the Northeast People's Publishing House has published: *Gun*, *Glorious Family*, and *Model Brothers*. The Liaodong People's Publishing House has published: *The Story of Xu Shoufeng*. The Northeast Agricultural Publishing House has published: *Special Model Wang Zhentang*. The content is mostly based on praising combat heroes, labor models, and strengthening vigilance against special agents.

Popular Finance and Economics Journal *Trade Learning*

*Trade Learning* magazine (formerly known as *Business Learning*, as reported in this journal's fourth Publication Dynamics column) of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government is currently the only relatively popular journal among national finance and economics journals. Its characteristic is that it does not have the shortcomings of most finance and economics journals, which are full of documents and large articles. It focuses on the need and level of middle and lower-level working cadres in the trade department, focusing on the inculcation of business knowledge, the introduction of work experience, and answering questions. These contents are very practical and useful. It was originally an "internal publication." After being publicly issued in January of this year, the initial printing of 5,000 copies was "sold out." The second and third issues were increased to 7,000 copies, but it was still not enough. By the seventh issue, it had increased to 20,000 copies. This provides some "internal publications" with experience that should be considered for absorption.

*Historical Materials on American Aggression Against China*

*Historical Materials on American Aggression Against China* (first published by the People's Publishing House in early April, priced at 8,500 yuan) compiles 31 articles published in major national newspapers from November 15th to December 26th of last year on the topic of American aggression against China. These articles all focus on a certain historical event, collect rich historical materials, and list specific facts to analyze and denounce the crimes of American imperialism in its aggression against China. This is a very needed book. It contains richer and more accurate materials than generally published histories of American aggression against China.

The collection and research work of such historical materials is very necessary today. It will give the Chinese people a deeper anti-American education and help the research work of a complete history of American aggression against China.

Several Widely Circulated Periodicals

In the past, only *Mass Life*, edited by Comrade Zou Taofen, sold 200,000 copies, breaking the historical record. Generally, a periodical that could sell 10,000 to 20,000 copies was considered a best-selling publication. After the national liberation, the cultural demands of the broad masses of people have been unprecedentedly enhanced. Many periodicals, especially popular periodicals, have sold hundreds of thousands to more than one million copies. The following are the statistics of the recent sales of several widely circulated periodicals:

　　Current Affairs Handbook                  1,740,000 copies
　　Learning - Elementary Edition                 520,000 copies
　　Learning                                  300,000 copies
　　China Youth                              165,000 copies
　　Northeast Propagandist Handbook        150,000 copies (The 20th issue, a special issue on Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea, reached 300,000 copies)
　　North China People                         100,000 copies
　　
At the provincial level, the *Hebei Propagandist Handbook* published by Hebei Province sold 75,000 copies, which is the most.

*Introduction to Dewey Criticism*

The educational thought of John Dewey, the reactionary educator of American imperialism, had a considerable influence in the old Chinese education circles. A thorough criticism is very necessary. The foundation of Dewey's educational thought is shallow empiricism and anti-intellectualism. The result of this educational method is to create a disconnect between the theory and practice of youth, and to create a lack of principles and fixed opinions. *Introduction to Dewey Criticism* written by Cao Fu made a preliminary criticism of these (originally published in *People's Education* Volume 1, Issue 6 and Volume 2, Issue 1), and has now been published by the People's Education Press, which is worth reading for education workers. The whole book is divided into six sections: Growth Theory, Progress Theory, Uncertainty Theory, Wisdom Theory, Knowledge Theory, and Empiricism. 36-page format, 57 pages, priced at 1,900 yuan.

### 出版动态

1951-05-06
第6版()
专栏：出版动态

　　出版动态
    《人民教育》号召办好全国教育期刊
    《人民教育》创刊于去年五月一日，已出满两卷。自三卷一期起，依照中央教育部调整全国教育期刊的决定，它已被明确规定为中央教育部的机关刊物，负有在政策、思想上指导全国教育工作、指导和帮助办好全国教育期刊的责任。今后《人民教育》的主要内容，着重政策解释，总结和介绍重要的教育工作经验，教育科学的研究，教育思想和教育工作的批评，介绍苏联教育经验等。它将是中央教育部一个有力的政策、思想领导的武器。它的对象是全国各级教育行政干部及农村小学教师以外的各级教育工作者和教育研究工作者。
    三卷一期该刊发表了《努力办好教育期刊是我们的重大任务》的社论，和《全国教育期刊出版情况和调整的意见》的论文（本文已由本期本刊节载），检讨了《人民教育》过去一年的编辑工作以及全国教育期刊的缺点。要求全国教育领导机关，各教育期刊的编辑部，把自己的刊物办好。这个号召应该受到重视。
  从失败中接受经验
    本刊十三号出版动态栏曾报道了青年团西北工作委员会宣传部用民间形式编印了一套《青年时事小丛书》，销行很好。他们原先是经过了失败的。在去年九月间，他们也曾编印了两本小册子，每本收集了十几篇或二十几篇大文章，印成三十二开本的形式，每本都有一百多页。这两本书每本印了五千册，一直不容易销出去。原因是在编撰的内容上不通俗，文章长，本子厚，区乡干部和群众看不懂，不愿看，发不下去。今年一月份，检查了这些情况后，决定面向农村广大的区乡干部和青年团员、青年群众，通俗短小、采用民间形式的编辑方针，另外编了这套时事小书。因为这套丛书加强了地方性、通俗性，适合群众的要求和水准；而且本子小（四十八开），价钱低（每本定价三百元），发行的结果出乎意料地受到群众欢迎。前后五种共印了二十五万份，已全部销完。有一个农民通讯员写信给他们说：“那些小本子通俗好懂，能帮助宣传时事，村里人都喜欢念，又便宜，两个鸡蛋，一碗包谷就可以买一本。你们应该多印些，下面还是抢不到手。”
    这说明了只有真正地方性、通俗性的出版物，才能真正为群众所欢迎。这也说明了从失败中接受经验教训是很重要的。
  推荐《东北区建立宣传网的经验》
    富振声著的《东北区建立宣传网的经验》一文已由人民出版社印成单行本。这篇文章里，详尽地叙述了东北全区宣传网的各方面情况与经验：东北区建立宣传网的过程，宣传网对各项工作所起的作用，宣传内容、形式与方法，一年来建立宣传网的基本经验；并指出了今后如何改进。它可以供给各级党组织在建立、巩固与提高宣传网时的参考，也可以供各级报告员和各地宣传员学习用。我们希望出现更多的说明宣传工作中某些方面的经验的书籍，以更进一步改进与提高宣传工作。
  东北各出版社开始出版连环画
    东北各出版社根据群众反映：内地去的连环画价钱贵，不及时，而且结合东北具体情况的也少，现在已开始重视连环画的出版工作。最近已由东北人民出版社出版的有：《枪》、《光荣人家》、《模范兄弟》。辽东人民出版社出版的有：《徐守逢的故事》。东北农业出版社出版的有：《特等模范王振堂》。内容大多以赞扬战斗英雄、劳动模范及提高加强对特务的警惕性等题材为主。
  通俗性的财经类期刊《贸易学习》
    中央人民政府贸易部的《贸易学习》杂志（即本刊第四号出版动态栏报道的《业务学习》的改订名称），是全国财经类期刊中，在目前唯一比较通俗化的刊物。它的特点是没有象一般财经刊物那样满本是文件和大块文章的缺点。它针对贸易部门中级以下的工作干部的需要与水准，着重在业务知识的灌输，工作经验的介绍和问题解答。这些内容都是很实际有用的。它原来是一种“内部刊物”，从本年一月公开发行后，最初印五千册，“一售而罄”，第二、三期便增印七千份，还是不够，到第七期已增到二万份。这提供了某些“内部刊物”应该考虑吸取的经验。
  《美国侵华史料》
    《美国侵华史料》（人民出版社四月初版，定价甲八五○○元）编集了从去年十一月十五日起到十二月二十六日止发表在全国主要报纸上的有关美国侵华的文章三十一篇。这些文章都是以某一历史事件为中心，搜集了丰富的史料，列举具体的事实来分析和控诉美帝国主义侵华的罪恶。这是一本很适合需要的书。它比已出版的一般美帝侵华史，材料都更丰富、正确。
    象这种史料的搜集与研究工作，在今天是很必要的，它将给与我国人民以更深刻的抗美教育，而且有助于完整的美国侵华史的研究工作。
  几种销行广大的期刊
    过去我国出版的期刊只有邹韬奋同志编的《大众生活》销到二十万，打破了历史纪录，一般的能销到一、二万份就要算是畅销刊物了。全国解放后，广大人民的文化要求空前地提高了，许多刊物特别是通俗刊物，销达数十万到百余万份。下面是几种销行广大的最近销数的统计：
    时事手册            一七四万份
    学习初级版          五二万份
    学习      三○万份
    中国青年            一六万五千份
    东北宣传员手册      一五万份（第二十期抗美援朝专号发行
              达三十万份）
    华北人民            一○万份
    以省为单位，河北省出版的河北宣传员手册销达七万五千份，是最多的一种。
  《杜威批判引论》
    美帝国主义反动教育家杜威的教育思想，在中国旧教育界中影响是相当大的，加以彻底的批判十分必要。杜威教育思想的根本是浅薄的经验主义和反理智主义，这种教育方法的结果是造成青年的理论与实践脱离，无原则和无定见。曹孚先生写的《杜威批判引论》对于这些作了初步的批评（原载《人民教育》第一卷六期、第二卷一期），现已由人民教育社出版，值得教育工作者一读。全书分六节：生长论、进步论、无定论、智慧论、知识论、经验论。三十六开本，五十七面，售价一千九百元。
