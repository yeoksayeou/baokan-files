　　Soviet Union Accelerates Communist Construction Projects

　　Volga-Don Canal Excavation Speed Tripled

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch] The Soviet Union is vigorously carrying out great communist construction projects. According to TASS news: The excavation speed of the Volga-Don Canal has been increased to more than three times the original rate, with more than 100,000 cubic meters of rock now being excavated daily. At the construction sites of the nine water gates, concrete pouring work is carried out day and night, and the excavation of another four water gates is nearing completion. One of the main projects of the canal, dozens of sections of the Tsimlyanskaya lock project, have been completed. The goal for the construction workers in May is to pour 142,000 cubic meters of concrete on the locks. The fifth cement factory at the construction site has been put into operation, the construction of the concrete slab factory is being accelerated, and workers' residential areas and highway bridges are being built along the canal.

　　Excavation work is underway at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, and the first group of suction dredgers has excavated more than 10,000 cubic meters of soil. The second set of suction dredging equipment is about to arrive, and these two sets of machines will excavate the mud layer to a depth of six meters in May and June, digging out 350,000 cubic meters of soil. They will soon begin building earth walls to protect a portion of land reclaimed from the Volga River. An asphalt road, tens of kilometers long, is being built on the left bank of the Volga River, which will connect the future new city with Kuibyshev City.

　　At the construction site of the Turkmen Main Canal, large quantities of materials are being transported from all parts of the Soviet Union. Machines from Moscow, vehicles from Gorky City and Minsk, timber and mobile houses from the Urals and Siberia are constantly arriving at Takhta-Tash. A state farm covering an area of 1,000 hectares has been established near Takhta-Tash to supply agricultural products to the construction workers of the Turkmen Main Canal. The Construction Engineering Administration recently received more than 5,000 enthusiastic letters from working people in various places, requesting to participate in the construction of the Grand Canal.

　　苏联加速进行共产主义建设工程
    伏尔加—顿河运河挖掘工作速度增三倍
    【新华社二十二日讯】苏联正大力进行伟大的共产主义建设工程。据塔斯社讯：伏尔加河—顿河运河挖掘工作的速度已提高到原来的三倍以上，现在每天挖掘的岩石超过十万立方公尺。在九个水门的建筑现场上，浇灌混凝土的工作昼夜不停，另有四个水门的挖掘工程已接近完成。运河的主要工程之一——齐姆良斯卡雅的数十段水闸工程已经完工。建筑工人五月份的目标是在水闸上浇灌十四万二千立方公尺的混凝土。建筑现场上的第五个水泥制造厂已经开工，混凝土板工厂的建筑工程正加紧进行，运河的工人住宅区及公路桥梁正在建造中。
    在古比雪夫水电站正进行挖掘工作，第一组吸力挖掘机已挖掘了一万多立方公尺的泥土。第二组吸力挖掘设备即将运到，这两组机器在五六月间将把泥层挖掘至六公尺深，挖出三十五万立方公尺的泥土。他们不久将开始建筑土墙，以保护从伏尔加河上开辟出来的一部分土地。一条长达数十公里的沥青公路正在伏尔加河左岸上兴筑，这条公路将把未来的新城市和古比雪夫城连接起来。
    在土库曼大运河的建筑现场上，大批的材料正从苏联各地源源运到。莫斯科的机器、高尔基城和明斯克的车辆、乌拉尔和西伯利亚的木材和活动房屋，正不断地运抵塔赫亚·塔什。塔赫亚·塔什附近已成立了一座占地一千公顷的国家农场，以便把农产品供应给土库曼大运河的建筑工人。建筑工程管理局最近收到五千多封各地劳动人民热情的来信，他们要求参加大运河的建设工作。
