　　The May First of May First
    Written for the Beijing May 1st Labor Day Demonstration Parade of 1951

  (I)
　
    This is China's Red Square.
     This is the world's largest capital square.
     Silent and calm!
     Not a speck of dust is flying.
     Only from countless red flag shadows,
     reveals a curving red wall.
     A clear light,
     A red glow.
     Absolutely no pedestrians passing by.
     Only five arched bridges,
     lying prostrate;
     Two ornamental columns,
     standing tall.
     They are all quietly holding their breath,
     waiting for the mobilization order to descend.
     Boom! Boom! Boom!…
     Twenty-eight rings,
     each sound emanating,
     all from the East Legation Alley,
     from which imperialism was driven away two years ago,
     The May 1st Labor Day demonstration parade of 600,000 people,
     begins like this.
　
  (II)
　
     First to appear,
     are the cultural troupes,
     hundreds and thousands of waist drums,
     arranged into squares,
     following the rhythm,
     both drumming and dancing, unfolding.
     Next comes,
     the People's Liberation Army,
     Workers,
     Farmers,
     Students,
     Women,
     everything, everything,
     in a dazzling variety,
     vibrant and colorful,
     team after team,
     all must pass through a line of sight,
     this line of sight emanates from the reviewing stand on Tiananmen.
     Suddenly, from the crowd, peaceful doves are released,
     a large flock towards the sky,
     fly! fly!
     One flew onto the Tiananmen Gate tower,
     directly facing Mr. Guo Moruo on the reviewing stand,
     Coo! Coo, coo!
     As if calling:
     "Peace! Peace!
     Dear Elder Guo!
     You and I,
     everyone flies back and forth."
     Finally, it received Guo Lao's nodding understanding.
     In this procession,
     the majority are citizens,
     fully expressing their ardent and naive spirits:
     A limping old man,
     passed through Tiananmen,
     turning back at every step,
     constantly paying his respects,
     gazing at the rostrum,
     lost in thought, as if in a daze;
     Mothers who last year held babies in the procession,
     are not holding them this year,
     because for every alley,
     temporary nurseries were organized,
     to replace her in breastfeeding;
     A large group of monks,
     a large group of nuns,
     are all shouting slogans,
     they are all engaged in production, able to support themselves,
     except only on the issue of marriage.
     Finally, there are the units from government organizations,
     most significantly, the last banner,
     "General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea."
     Back and forth,
     a torrent of sounds and images, like a roaring thunder,
     "Long live the People's Republic of China!"
     "Long live Chairman Mao!"
　
  (III)
　
     He,
     like a Mount Tai,
     towering majestically on the Tiananmen Gate tower,
     like a round sun,
     emitting warm air currents in all directions,
     Marx,
     Lenin,
     Stalin,
     for over a hundred years,
     great inventions,
     brilliant achievements,
     relying on him,
     he found the correct pivot for us,
     relying on him,
     he led us towards the path of light!
     He is the writer of New Democracy,
     the writer of On Practice,
     the mentor of thought.
     Not just a general political leader,
     much less just a master of writing.
     Please look at the Tiananmen Gate tower,
     a large group of democratic party representatives,
     Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang,
     China Democratic League,
     China National Democratic Construction Association,
     China Association for Promoting Democracy,
     ……
     as well as non-party affiliated social celebrities,
     the united front has long been established,
     like stars surrounding the Big Dipper.
     "China produced a Mao Zedong,"
     the folk song has long been sung throughout the five continents of the twentieth century.
　
  (IV)
　
     Labor created the world,
     but the people of the world have not yet realized it,
     even the laborers themselves have not realized it intimately.
     Philosophers have revealed the truth,
     laborers have stood up,
     but there are still many, many powerful enemies at present.
     In order to unite the world's working class,
     in order to strive for the victorious unity of the world's workers,
     sixty-two years ago, (1889)
     May 1st of each year was designated as International Labor Day.
     But the "May First" of New China,
     the significance is not just these,
     our laborers have already won.
     The People's Republic of China's united front regime,
     the foundation is the worker-peasant alliance,
     the leader is the working class.
     But,
     dying imperialism,
     its ambitions have not yet been cut off,
     across the Bohai Sea,
     the American imperialists, repeatedly defeated,
     are still constantly struggling.
     This is precisely worth heightened vigilance.
     We must step up production.
     We must strengthen unity.
     Whether physical laborers,
     mental laborers,
     work leaders.
     Every single person,
     has a bit of strength, dedicate a bit of strength.
     Remember!
     This is not an ordinary, general May 1st Labor Day,
     it will raise awareness from joy,
     it will bring impetus from celebration.
     How profound the meaning!
     This is truly the May First of 1951,
     the May First of May First.

　　五一的五一
    为一九五一年五月一日北京五一劳动节示威游行大会作
      黄炎培
  （一）
　
    这是中国的红场。
     这是世界最大的首都广场。
     静荡荡！
     不见有一点灰尘在飞扬。
     只从无数面红旗影里，
     透露出一曲一直的红墙。
     一片晴光，
     一片红光。
     绝没有行人来往。
     只剩着五座圜桥，
     俯伏着；
     两座华表，
     耸立着。
     它们都悄悄地屏着气，
     等候那动员令下降。
     轰隆！轰隆，轰隆！……
     二十八响，
     一声一声发出来，
     都从那已经在两年前赶走了
     帝国主义的东交民巷，
     六十万人五一劳动节示威大游行，
     就这样开场。
　
  （二）
　
     最先出场，
     是文工大队，
     几百千个腰鼓，
     编成了方形，
     跟着节拍，
     且鼓且舞地展开。
     接上来，
     解放军，
     工人，
     农民，
     学生，
     妇女，
     一切一切，
     五花八门地，
     有声有色地，
     一队一队，
     都须通过一条视线，
     这视线发自天安门游行检阅的高台。
     忽然从人群里放出和平鸽子，
     一大群向着天空，
     飞！飞！
     有一头飞上了天安门楼，
     恰和检阅台郭沫若先生相对，
     咕！咕，咕！
     仿佛在唤着：
     “和平！和平！
     亲爱的郭老！
     我和你，
     大家飞去又飞来。”
     终于得到了郭老的点头神会。
     在这队伍中间，
     占着多数的是市民，
     充分表现出热诚而又天真的神态：
     一颠一拐的老汉，
     走过了天安门，
     一步一回头，
     不断地致敬，
     望着主席台
     凝着神，像发呆；
     母亲们去年在队里还抱着婴孩，
     今年不抱了，
     为的是每一条巷子，
     组织了临时托儿所，
     在代替她喂奶；
     一大群和尚，
     一大群尼姑，
     都跟着喊口号，
     他们和她们都在搞生产，能自立了，
     只在婚姻问题上，还是除外。
     最后是机关队伍，
     很有意义的是末了一幅旗帜，
     “抗美援朝总会”。
     前前后后，
     一片声像狂潮，像怒雷，
     “中华人民共和国万岁！”
     “毛主席万岁！”
　
  （三）
　
     他，
     像一座泰山，
     巍巍地耸立在天安门楼，
     像一轮太阳，
     向着四面八方放出了温暖的气流，
     马克思，
     列宁，
     斯大林，
     一百多年来，
     伟大的发明，
     辉煌的成就，
     靠了他，
     替我们找出了正确的枢纽，
     靠了他，
     带我们向着光明的大道走！
     他是写新民主主义者，
     写实践论者，
     是思想的导师。
     不是一般的政治领袖，
     更不只是文章妙手。
     请看天安门楼，
     一大群民主党派代表，
     民革，
     民盟，
     民建，
     民进，
     ……
     还有无党无派的社会名流，
     统一战线早已成立了，
     像众星环拱着北斗。
     “中国出了一个毛泽东”，
     民歌早唱遍了二十世纪地球上五个大洲。
　
  （四）
　
     劳动创造了世界，
     可是世界人们还没有认识，
     连劳动者自己也没有认识得亲切。
     哲人把真理揭穿了，
     劳动者站起来了，
     可是还存在着不少不少当前的强敌。
     为了团结世界工人阶级，
     为了争取世界工人胜利团结，
     在六十二年以前，（一八八九年）
     公定了每年五月一日国际劳动节。
     可是新中国的“五一”，
     意义还不只这些，
     我们的劳动者已经胜利了。
     中华人民共和国统一战线的政权，
     基础是工农联盟，
     领导者是工人阶级。
     但是，
     垂死的帝国主义，
     野心还不肯断绝，
     隔着渤海湾，
     屡战屡败的美帝，
     还在不断地挣扎。
     这正值得提高警惕。
     我们要加紧生产。
     要加强团结。
     不管是体力劳动者，
     脑力劳动者，
     工作领导者。
     每一个人，
     有一分力，献一分力。
     记着！
     这不是寻常地一般地五一劳动节，
     它将从欢欣中提起警觉，
     将从庆祝中带来鞭策。
     意义多么深长呀！
     这才是一九五一年的五一，
     五一的五一。
