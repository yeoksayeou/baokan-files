    Industry and Commerce Circles in Runan County, Henan Province
    Commend Models for Implementing Patriotic Pledges

    In order to further promote the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement, the industry and commerce circles in Chengguan District, Runan County, Henan Province, recently inspected the implementation of the patriotic pledges established in December of last year on a voluntary basis. Each store sent representatives to form several inspection teams to carry out work in different areas. After four days of inspection, models for implementing the patriotic pledges were selected and commended and encouraged, and individual businesses that violated the patriotic pledges were criticized. Through this inspection, the anti-American and aid-Korea sentiment of the industry and commerce circles has become even higher. Cigarette vendors collectively paid their May taxes at the end of April, and some businesses that had violated the patriotic pledges also stated that they would conscientiously and earnestly implement the patriotic pledges in the future and strive to be models. Everyone said, "In the past, right and wrong were not clear, so we didn't work hard. After this inspection, right and wrong are clear, and we have the energy to work." The industry and commerce circles in the district are preparing to summarize the achievements and shortcomings found in the inspection as a reference for future implementation of the patriotic pledges.

    I think their approach is very good. Only with inspection can the realization of the patriotic pledges be guaranteed. I suggest that all agencies, organizations, and industry and commerce circles across the country that have established patriotic pledges should regularly inspect the implementation of the patriotic pledges so that they do not become a mere formality.

　　河南汝南县工商界
    评选履行爱国公约模范编辑同志：
    河南省汝南县城关区工商业界为了深入开展抗美援朝爱国运动，最近在大家自愿的基础上检查了去年十二月订立的爱国公约的执行情况。由各商店推派代表组成若干检查小组分片进行工作，经过了四天的检查，评选出执行爱国公约中的模范，进行了表扬与鼓励，对于违犯爱国公约的个别商号给予了批评。通过这次检查，工商界抗美援朝的情绪更高了，纸烟摊在四月底就集体纳完了五月份的税，有些曾违犯爱国公约的商号也表示今后认真切实地执行爱国公约，争取做模范。大家说：“过去黑白不分，做起来就不起劲。经过这次检查，黑白分明了，做起来才有劲。”该区工商界准备将检查中发现的成绩与缺点总结出来，作为今后执行爱国公约的参考。
    我觉得他们这种作法是很好的，有了检查才能保证爱国公约的实现。我建议全国各地已经订立了爱国公约的机关、团体、工商界等，都应经常地检查爱国公约执行情况，使爱国公约不流于形式。
