The Ideological Debate on "The Life of Wu Xun" Should Be Taken Seriously
    ——Opinions on Reading Comrade Duanmu Hongliang's Two Articles
    Wang Huadong
    Duanmu Hongliang's article, "Wu Xun is a Model Figure Affirmed by the Feudal Rulers," was published in the May 20th issue of "People's Literature." Compared to the article "On "The Life of Wu Xun"" he co-authored with Yang Yuming two months ago (published in the first issue of the second volume of "Beijing Literature"), although there is some progress in viewpoint, it fails to reveal to the readers his original erroneous viewpoints and their roots with a serious attitude, but rather adopts a vague and inclusive attitude towards his own errors. His article lacks the necessary minimum of self-criticism.
    Now, let's look at his appraisal of Wu Xun in the article "On "The Life of Wu Xun""! He immediately tells the reader: "Wu Xun is a working person. Throughout his entire life, he has never been separated from production. His begging is carried out after labor, begging is not his profession, but is used to fill rest time or unemployment periods to increase production." The author's subjective arbitrariness is very astonishing. I don't know what he based his claim that Wu Xun never separated himself from production, and it is even more strange to consider his begging as a sideline production in addition to labor. What is the actual situation? Before the age of thirty, Wu Xun was a bankrupt peasant in the countryside, working as a long-term laborer and doing odd jobs, but in the subsequent twenty years, he mainly relied on begging to maintain his life, and in fact became a vagrant in the countryside. This kind of vagrant not only has no effect on social production, but is precisely a parasitic consumer. Comrade Duanmu said that his begging was used to "increase production," which shows that he lacks even the common sense of social science.
    Next, he made another conjecture about Wu Xun, saying: "Wu Xun personally experienced the entire stage of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Although we cannot find historical evidence to explain what role this revolution played for him, we can definitely know that the peasants stood up and could give the officials a fatal blow. This principle, I think Wu Xun understood." Whether Wu Xun could understand it is certainly still a question. If it is believed that he could understand this principle, then it just shows that Wu Xun's use of running free schools to paralyze the people's will to fight and weaken the peasants' resistance movement was conscious and deliberate, which can only prove that Wu Xun is more sinister and hateful. In this way, Duanmu's subjective wish to praise Wu Xun as a "hero" cannot be achieved, and it cannot be considered that Wu Xun's behavior of establishing schools has a revolutionary nature. Comrade Duanmu also said: "The reason why the oppressed cannot stand up is because their eyes are covered. Wu Xun believes that if you want to see the truth, the first thing you must do is to uncover the blindfold over your eyes. Thus, this is not just a question of literacy, but a question of the poor becoming literate and gaining greater awareness, and knowing how they are oppressed." This is completely a idealistic view that reverses historical facts.
    In fact, everyone knows that the reason why peasants are oppressed is caused by the political and economic rule of the feudal class, and it has nothing to do with literacy. Under such a social system, even if you are literate, aren't you still serving the reactionary rulers? In order to complete Wu Xun's heroic image, the author even said that Wu Xun's ability to lend money at high interest rates and act as a matchmaker is "precisely the expression of high intelligence, which a stupid person could not possibly do." It's really strange that lending money at high interest rates has also become an "expression of high intelligence"! He praised Wu Xun for being able to sing and tell stories, not talking nonsense, and not saying things without content. Yes, this is true, but he did not distinguish what kind of content this so-called content is, whether it is content welcomed by the reactionary rulers or content welcomed by the people?
    In the author's eyes, almost everything about Wu Xun is worthy of praise and eulogy, and even his lifelong failure to marry a wife is considered to be far-sighted, and is "an organizer and mover" (even the author did not say what kind of "organizer and mover") for "maintaining the social nature of the free school" and opposing the "outstanding" behavior of the patriarchal private ownership system. Even Wu Xun's kneeling and kowtowing to reactionaries is considered not to lose human dignity, but a kind of "great protest and great contempt" for the enemy. I can't help but suspect that the authors have lost the sense of human dignity?!
    In short, in the author's eyes, Wu Xun is a perfect person, a person who is accustomed to tenacious struggle, full of intelligence and wisdom, has a deep mind, a strong memory, can speak and act, and is full of rebellious spirit. Therefore, after he affirmed the production of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," saying that "the attitude is serious, and his class viewpoint is very clear, which is worthy of encouragement," he then complained that this film did not praise Wu Xun enough, distorted Wu Xun, and did not write Wu Xun as a hero, but instead wrote him as a "submissive character," "often putting the rebellious Wu Xun in a secondary position." After a series of wrong evaluations of Wu Xun, the author still thought that this was the correct historical viewpoint and scientific attitude, and he used this method to "find the inner Wu Xun through the outer Wu Xun." Is the correct historical viewpoint and scientific attitude like this? The answer is of course no. From the above-mentioned arguments, it can only be proved that the author seriously violated the historical viewpoint and scientific attitude in this regard.
    The author did not examine these places at all in his second article. Why did the model figure he affirmed in the first article become a model figure affirmed by the feudal rulers when it appeared for the second time? Why did he oppose the movie "Wu Xun" being written as a submissive character in the first article, but in the second article he himself determined that Wu Xun was a submissive character? Then, as he sees it now, isn't the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" still very correct?
    So, let's take a look at the second article:
    First, he regards Wu Xun as a "submissive person. He may sometimes show his protest or contempt for some people, but in essence he is submissive, humble and compromising." On the surface, it seems like this, but it is not actually the case. Wu Xun is by no means just a simple negative person. He actively propagandized for the feudal rulers with his own actions. He was meritorious and progressive in maintaining the old morality and the old order. He fanatically "did his best to flatter the reactionary feudal rulers." He "negated the class struggle of the oppressed people and surrendered to the reactionary feudal rulers." (May 20th People's Daily editorial) To regard such an active slave as a passive, submissive weakling is likely to create the impression that there is no need to spend time on such a person to carry out ideological struggle, thus weakening the importance of this debate. This view is obviously wrong. Everyone should face up to this ideological struggle. This is a major issue of principle. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out, tolerating the propaganda of Wu Xun "is to admit or tolerate the reactionary propaganda that slanders the revolutionary struggle of the peasants, slanders Chinese history, and slanders the Chinese nation, and to regard reactionary propaganda as legitimate propaganda."
    Second, when mentioning what kind of person Wu Xun is, the author still retains such a view, thinking that "his composition is good, his labor is good, his hard-working style, his altruism..." It is undeniable that composition has a great influence on a person's thinking, but Marxists are not proponents of the theory of composition alone. We judge whether a person is good or bad mainly based on his words and deeds and their effects. Taking a step back, how can a beggar like Wu Xun be called "good composition, good labor"? The fundamental meaning of labor is to be able to create value. What value is created by kneeling, kowtowing, matchmaking, eating scorpions, etc.? Other things such as "hard-working style, altruism" also show that there are still some confused ideas in the author's mind. Wu Xun's "hard-working style" is not "altruism" for the masses of the people, but only "altruism" for the reactionary feudal rulers. In fact, Wu Xun's "hard work" is precisely his capital for obtaining the praise of the rulers. After his free school succeeded and he gained fame, his "Wu Qi" was changed to "Wu Xun," and the "free school syndrome" was given the title of "righteous school director." What kind of "altruism" is this?
    It is easy to be wary of a tiger with teeth and claws, but a painted skin monster requires a more sober mind and sharper eyes; it is easy to be wary of a counter-revolutionary with a knife, but for people like Wu Xun who use asceticism to win people's sympathy and numb and poison people's souls, a more careful observation and greater vigilance are needed. We must not only be good at identifying all kinds of enemies and all kinds of slaves who serve the enemy, but also be good at identifying those reactionary reformist theories that are cloaked in progressive clothes.
    The people know at a glance national scum like Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang who openly recognize the enemy as their father. Even the slaves' masters understand this, so they want to add an "righteous school director" in addition to these "Duke Wen Zheng" and "Duke Wen Zhong," and look for some figures from all aspects who can better maintain feudal morality and reactionary order to stabilize their rule. Wu Xun is one of their most ideal. He uses inhuman rule, and Wu Xun is one of their most ideal. He uses inhuman asceticism to erode the people's fighting spirit, confuse the people's direction of struggle, maintain the old traditions and old morality, and actively cultivate more and more docile slaves for the reactionary ruling class. The reason why Wu Xun was promoted so highly from the Manchu Qing Dynasty to Chiang Kai-shek is precisely because he sincerely did something extremely beneficial to the feudal rulers. The so-called "there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart," and "attacking the mind is the best strategy." The feudal rulers know the meaning of these words. They can stand on the heads of the masses of the people and shout to the people: "Look, Wu Xun is a poor man, and he does not approve of those 'rebels' like Zhou Da."
    What the enemy thinks is good is exactly what we should say is bad; what the enemy wants to preserve is exactly what we want to destroy; this is the position and attitude that a Chinese people should have. "The Life of Wu Xun" has given our ideological and cultural circles a very good test. After this test, it will better spur us to seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. I believe that through this ideological struggle, everyone's understanding will definitely be raised a step.

### 应该认真对待《武训传》的思想论争——读端木蕻良同志两篇文章的意见

　　应该认真对待《武训传》的思想论争
    ——读端木蕻良同志两篇文章的意见
    王化东
    五月二十日《人民文艺》上，发表了端木蕻良同志的《武训是封建统治者所肯定的示范人物》。这篇文章，比起两月前他和杨雨明同志合写的那篇《论〈武训传〉》来（发表在《北京文艺》二卷一期），观点虽有一些进步，但未能做到以认真的态度向读者揭露自己原来的错误观点及其根源，而是对自己的错误采取含混的、包容的态度。他的文章缺少必要的起码的自我批评。
    现在，我们来看他在《论〈武训传〉》这篇文章中对武训的鉴定吧！他劈头便告诉读者：“武训是一个劳动人民。在他全部生命史上，从来就没有脱离过生产。他的行乞是在劳动之余来进行的，行乞并不是他的职业，而是用来填补休息时间或失业的时期来增大生产的。”作者的这种主观武断是教人非常惊异的。我不知道他根据什么硬说武训从来没有脱离过生产，甚至更奇怪的是把他的行乞也认为是劳动之余的副业生产。实际的情形是怎样的呢？武训在三十多岁以前，他是农村中的破产者，给人当过长工，打过短工，但他后来的二十多年，便主要靠乞讨来维持生活，实际上成了农村中的游民。这种游民不但对社会的生产毫无作用，而恰是一种消费的寄生者。端木同志说他的行乞是用来“增大生产”的，这就连社会科学的常识都没有了。
    接着，他又对武训作了另一个臆断，他说：“武训正好亲身经历太平天国的全个阶段，我们现在虽然无法寻找出历史的根据，说明这个革命对他到底起了什么作用，但我们可以肯定的知道，就是农民站起来，可以给官府们致命的当头一棒，这个道理，我想武训是悟得出来的。”武训是不是悟得出来当然还是一个问题，如果认为他能悟出这个道理，那么就正好说明了武训用办义学来麻痹人民的斗争意志，削弱农民的反抗运动，是有意识的自觉的了，这只能证明武训更阴毒更可恶，这样更达不到端木同志歌颂武训为“英雄”的主观愿望，更不能认为武训兴学行为具有革命性了。端木同志又说：“被压迫者所以不能站起来，是因为眼睛给人蒙上了的原故。武训认为要想看到真理，第一件事就必须揭开了那蒙在眼睛上面的眼罩。这样在这里便不只是一个识字不识字的问题，而是穷人识了字，才会得到更大的觉悟的问题，才会知道自己是怎样才被压迫的问题。”这完全是一种颠倒历史事实的唯心论的观点。
    事实上，大家都知道，农民所以受压迫，是封建阶级在政治上经济上的统治所造成的，同识字与不识字是不相干的。在那样的社会制度下，纵使识了字还不是同样为反动统治者服务？作者为了要完成武训的英雄形象，竟把武训放高利贷，给人家说媒拉纤等等本领也说成“这正是智慧高度的表现，决不是一个愚蠢痴呆的人所可能做到的”。真奇怪，放高利贷，也变成“智慧高度的表现”了！他赞美武训会唱歌，会讲故事，不说废话，也不说没有内容的话。是的，这是真的，但他没有区别这种所谓内容究竟是一些什么样的内容是反动统治者所欢迎的内容，还是人民所欢迎的内容？
    在作者的眼里，几乎武训的一切都是值得赞美歌颂的，甚至把他终身不讨老婆也认为这是有远见的，是“一个组织者和运动者”（连作者也没有说出是干什么的“组织者运动者”）为了“保持义学的社会性”，为了反对家长制私有制的“卓越”行为。甚至把武训的向反动者下跪、磕头也认为并不失人类的尊严，是一种对敌人的“大抗议和大轻蔑。”我真不禁怀疑作者们是否失去了人类尊严的感觉？！
    总之，在作者的眼里，武训是一个十全十美的人物，是一个惯于韧性战斗，充满了聪明智慧，心眼深，记性强能说能行，富有反抗精神的人物。因之在他肯定电影《武训传》的制作，“态度是严肃的，他的阶级观点放得非常分明，这是值得鼓励的”之后，便嫌这部片子对武训表扬的还不到家，使武训受到歪曲，把武训没有写成一个英雄，相反的写成一个“逆来顺受的人物”，“常常是把反抗的武训放在次要的地位”，作者在一连串地给武训做了错误的评价之后，还自以为这才是正确的历史观点和科学态度，他运用这种方法“透过外在的武训，寻到内在的武训”。难道正确的历史观点与科学态度是这样的吗？回答当然是否定的。从以上所举的那些论点中，只能证明作者在这方面恰恰是严重地违反了历史观点与科学态度的。
    以上这些地方，作者在他第二篇文章里根本没有检讨。为什么在第一篇文章里被他所肯定的示范人物，在二次出现时就成了封建统治者所肯定的示范人物了呢？为什么在第一篇文章里他反对电影把“武训写成一个逆来顺受的人物”而在第二篇文章里自己又确定武训是一个逆来顺受的人物呢？那末，照他现在看起来，电影《武训传》岂不还是很正确的吗？
    那么，我们再看看第二篇文章吧：
    第一、他把武训看成是一个“逆来顺受的人，他可能有时表露出他对某一些人的抗议或轻视，但在本质上他是逆来顺受，卑屈妥协的”。在表面上看，好象是的，实际却不是。武训决不仅仅是一个单纯的消极人物，他是用自己的行动，积极地为封建统治者作宣传，在维护旧道德旧秩序上，他是有功劳的，进取的，他狂热地“对反动的封建统治者，竭尽奴颜婢膝的能事”，他“否定被压迫人民的阶级斗争，向反动的封建统治者投降”。（五月二十日人民日报社论）把这样一个积极的奴才，看成一个消极的逆来顺受的弱者，很可能造成这样一种印象，用不着花费时间在这样人物身上来开展思想斗争，因而减弱了对这个论争的重视，这种看法显然是错误的。大家都应该正视这场思想斗争，这是一个原则性的大问题，正如人民日报社论中所指出的，容忍了对武训的宣传，“就是承认或者容忍污蔑农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史，污蔑中国民族的反动宣传，就是把反动宣传认为正当的宣传。”
    第二、在提到武训究竟是一个什么人物上，作者仍然保留了这样一种观点，认为“他的成份好，劳动好，刻苦作风，利他主义……”不可否认，成份对一个人的思想是有重大影响的，但马克思主义者也不是唯成份论者，我们评判一个人物的好坏，主要看他的言行及其所产生的效果。退一步说，象武训这样一个乞丐，怎么能称得上“成份好，劳动好”呢？劳动的根本意义，是要能创造价值，下跪，磕头，说媒，吃蝎子等等，创造什么价值呢？其他如“刻苦作风，利他主义”等等，也说明作者的头脑中还存在着一些糊涂观念。武训的“刻苦作风”并不是对于人民大众的“利他主义”，而只是对于反动封建统治者的“利他主义”。事实上，武训的“刻苦”，正是他取得统治者表扬的资本。在他的义学功成名遂之后，他的“武七”被改成了“武训”，“义学症”被敕封为“义学正”。这是什么“利他主义”呢？
    张牙舞爪的老虎，是容易戒备的，而那种画皮的妖怪，就需要更清醒的头脑和锐利的眼；拿着刀的反革命是容易戒备的，但对于用苦行来博取人的同情和麻痹毒害人的灵魂象武训这样的人，就需要更缜密的观察与更大的警惕。我们不仅要善于识别各式各样的敌人和各式各样的为敌人服务的奴才，而且还要善于识别那些披着进步外衣的反动的改良主义的理论。
    象曾国藩、李鸿章这样公开认贼作父的民族败类，人民是一望而知的，这一点，连奴才的主人也很明白，所以他们要在这些“文正公”“文忠公”之外，再加上一个“义学正”，从各方面物色一些更能维护封建道德和反动秩序的人物来稳固他们的统治，武训就是他们最理想的一个。他用违反人性统治，武训就是他们最理想的一个。他用违反人性的苦行来消蚀人民的斗志，迷惑人民的斗争方向，维护着旧传统旧道德，而且积极地为反动统治阶级培养出更多更驯顺的奴才。从满清到蒋介石之所以把武训推崇得那样高，正是因为他是诚心诚意地为封建统治者作了一件对他们极为有利的事情。所谓“哀莫大于心死”，“攻心为上”，封建统治者是知道这些话的意义的。他们可以站在人民大众的头上向人民大叫：“你们看，武训是一个穷人呀，他是不赞成周大那些‘叛逆者’的呀。”
    敌人认为好的，正是我们应该说坏的；敌人要保存的，正是我们所要摧毁的；这是做为一个中国人民应有的立场和态度。《武训传》在这方面给我们思想界文化界作了一个很好的测验，经过这一测验，将更好地鞭策我们认真地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。我相信经过这次思想斗争，一定可以使大家的认识提高一步。
