　　To the Editorial Board:
    The manager of Zheng Mingzhai Confectionery on Meishi Street outside Qianmen, Beijing, transferred funds when Beijing was liberated, relying entirely on credit for raw materials to do business. Later, through the hard work of the employees, they made a profit of 14,000 jin of corn in one year. However, the capitalist remained indifferent to the employees' suggestions for expanding the business and continued to spend large amounts of money. Recently, the manager and his mother overspent 1.24 million yuan; they also intentionally delayed paying the workers' wages.
    Early February was the time for the confectionery to take stock and settle accounts. The employees demanded that the capitalist pay the wages owed for more than two months, but the capitalist not only refused to pay but also made harsh demands on the workers: (1) Wages would only be paid if there was a net profit each month; (2) Before the outstanding debts are paid off, the counter will be managed by the workers, but all expenses of the capitalist will remain the same; (3) If the above two conditions are not agreed to, all workers will be dismissed without severance pay. The employees immediately protested. Manager Sun Yimao and Deputy Manager Ma Zengxian then went to the Labor Bureau to complain that "the workers refused to leave after being dismissed." The government did not accept the case because they did not report a business closure. After returning, the capitalist neither reported a business closure nor settled down to do business; they continued to delay paying the workers' back wages. When employee Ren Derui was sick and needed money, the capitalist refused to pay his wages. On April 8, Deputy Manager Ma Zengxian even beat up apprentice Li Deyi under a false pretense. On April 12, the union's organizing committee planned to ask for leave to attend a meeting for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, but Deputy Manager Ma Zengxian refused to allow it. The union office has now reported the capitalist's consistent oppression of the workers to the Labor Bureau for handling. We, all the employees, also put forward the following points: (1) The capitalist has not been doing business properly for the past year and has deliberately provoked labor-capital disputes and should be criticized and educated; (2) The capitalist has distorted the facts, falsely accused the workers, and beaten up the apprentice, and should make a public self-criticism and guarantee that it will not happen again in the future; (3) We demand that the capitalist quickly pay the employees' back wages and set a method for paying wages in the future.
            All employees of Zheng Mingzhai

### 正明斋经理应该积极经营买卖

　　正明斋经理应该积极经营买卖编辑同志：
    北京市前门外煤市街正明斋点心铺，在北京解放时，经理就把资金转移了，全靠赊原料作买卖。后来经过职工艰苦经营，一年内盈余一万四千斤玉米。但资方对职工所提扩大经营的建议，仍然漠不关心，并且不断大量开支资金。最近经理和他的母亲又透支了一百二十四万元；对工人工资则有意拖欠。
    二月初是点心铺盘货算账的时候。职工要求资方付清拖欠了二个多月的工资，资方不但不给，还向工人提出苛刻的要求：（一）每月有了纯利才给工人工资；（二）在外债未还清，以前柜上由工人经营管理，资方的一切开支照旧；（三）如果不答应以上两项条件，则解雇全体工人，不给解雇金。职工们当即提出抗议。经理孙益茂、副经理马增先却先后到劳动局控告说：“工人被解雇了不肯走。”政府因其未报歇业不受理。资方回来后，既不报歇业，也不安心作买卖；对工人的欠薪仍是拖延不付。职员任德瑞有病要用钱，资方也不给开支工资。四月八日，副理马增先并借故痛打了学徒李德义。四月十二日工会的组织委员为了抗美援朝工作拟请假去开会，副经理马增先也不允许。现在工会办事处已将资方一贯压迫工人的情形，报请劳动局处理。我们全体职工也提出下面几点意见：（一）一年来资方不好好作买卖，故意挑拨劳资纠纷，应该受到批评教育；（二）资方歪曲事实，诬告工人，并殴打学徒，应作公开检讨，保证今后不再重犯；（三）要求资方赶快付清职工欠薪，并定出今后支付工资办法。
            正明斋全体职工
