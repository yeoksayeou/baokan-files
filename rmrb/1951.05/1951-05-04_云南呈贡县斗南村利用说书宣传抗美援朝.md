    Yunnan Chenggong County Dou Nan Village Uses Storytelling to Promote the Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
    To the Editor:
    Storytelling is a good way to conduct current affairs propaganda in rural areas. Dou Nan Village in Chenggong County, Yunnan Province, uses storytelling to carry out propaganda about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea among the masses, which has played a great role.
    There is a place in Dou Nan Village, Chenggong County, where storytelling is frequently performed. Every night when storytelling takes place, there are many listeners. After the movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country was launched, this storytelling venue began to carry out mass current affairs propaganda work, telling stories such as "The Century of Blood Debts of U.S. Aggression Against China" and its own adapted "Stories of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea," which were warmly welcomed by the masses. If storytelling stopped for one night, the farmers would ask questions. "The Century of Blood Debts of U.S. Aggression Against China" was told for three consecutive days, and the masses listened with great interest. After the storytelling, many listeners took the initiative to speak and offer opinions. Some said, "If we don't listen to the lectures, how can we know that U.S. imperialism has been bullying China for more than a hundred years!" Others said, "So U.S. imperialism's intention in fighting in Korea is still to bully China!" Some farmers, connecting with the disasters they have suffered, complained and said, "Chennault and his gang built airfields in those years and did opium business, poisoning the Chinese people. It's really a crime!" "When the airfields were built, how many women were ruined by those American robbers!" Some farmers said even more angrily, "These crimes of U.S. imperialism must be settled in the same way as struggling against evil landlords."
    In rural areas, storytelling should pay attention to two things: (1) There should be a regular place and a fixed time; it cannot be intermittent. (2) The storyteller must constantly collect local language, must be involved in mass movements, understand the ideological situation and problems of the masses, and use local language and facts to tell stories, which is most easily accepted by the masses.

    云南呈贡县斗南村利用说书宣传抗美援朝编辑同志：
    说书，是农村时事宣传的好方式。云南省呈贡县斗南村用说书的形式向群众进行抗美援朝的宣传，起了很大的作用。
    呈贡县斗南村有个经常说书的地方，每天晚上说书时，听众很多。当抗美援朝保家卫国运动开展后，这个说书的地方就展开了群众性的时事宣传工作，讲《美国侵略中国百年来的血债》，讲自己改编的《抗美援朝故事》等，得到群众热烈的欢迎；如果有一天晚上停止说书，农民们就纷纷提出质问。《美国侵略中国百年来的血债》连续讲了三天，群众听得津津有味；讲完后许多听众自动发言，提出意见。有的说：“不听讲，怎个会晓得美帝国主义整我们中国已经有一百年多啦！”有的说：“原来美帝国主义打朝鲜，居心还是要来整咱中国呵！”有一部分农民，联系着自己所遭受的灾难，提出控诉说：“陈纳德那几年修飞机场，做大烟生意，毒害中国人民，真是罪恶！”“修飞机场时，他们这班美国强盗糟塌多少女人呀！”有的农民更愤怒地说：“美帝国主义这些罪恶账，非像斗争恶霸地主那样向他们清算不可。”
    在农村里说书，应该注意两件事：（一）要有经常的地方，要有规定的时间，不能时断时续。（二）说书的人必须经常搜集地方语言，必须投身群众运动之中，了解群众的思想情况和问题，运用当地的语言和事实来说书，最易为群众接受。
