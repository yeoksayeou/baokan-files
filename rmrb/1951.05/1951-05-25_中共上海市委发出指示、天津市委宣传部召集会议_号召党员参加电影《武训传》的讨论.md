    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC Issued Instructions, and the Tianjin Municipal Propaganda Department Convened a Meeting to Call on Party Members to Participate in the Discussion of the Film "The Life of Wu Xun"
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued "Instructions on Launching a Discussion on 'The Life of Wu Xun'" on the 23rd, calling on its affiliated Party organizations and members to seriously participate in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun." The instructions also stipulated specific measures to strengthen the leadership of this discussion and improve the leadership of cultural and educational work.
    The instructions stated: This film was produced in Shanghai and premiered in Shanghai. However, the cadres responsible for leading propaganda, cultural, and educational work in Shanghai have consistently failed to point out its serious ideological and political errors of principle, and many comrades have expressed opinions of praise and admiration. The Municipal Committee also bears responsibility for this confused and erroneous thinking. Therefore, it is an important political task to seriously launch a critique of these erroneous ideas and thereby raise the ideological level of all Party members.
    The instructions pointed out: The purpose of launching this discussion is to learn the basic principles of the proletarian worldview, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism, and to learn the basic content of communism and people's democracy through this critical work; and to master this weapon of understanding and analyzing problems, to criticize the confused and erroneous thinking of "The Life of Wu Xun," which sings the praises of and praises things while slandering the Chinese peasants' revolutionary struggle, slandering Chinese history, and slandering the Chinese nation; to make serious self-criticism of one's own erroneous thinking, in order to improve the understanding of Party members and clarify the correct viewpoints and positions. The instructions stipulated: This discussion should first be carried out immediately among Party member cadres in propaganda, cultural, and educational work posts throughout the city. In addition to continuing to focus on the study of "Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries," general Party member cadres may conduct organized discussions in conjunction with theoretical study and Party life after this central study is launched. Party members in other branches, in addition to regularly reading relevant commentaries in newspapers and journals for study, may conduct necessary discussions and criticisms in conjunction with political classes, Party classes, and Communist Youth League classes. The instructions stipulated: Discussions and criticisms can be carried out in Party groups under the leadership of the branch; the Party committee should pay attention to organizing relevant reports on this aspect in newspapers. Every Party member cadre has the responsibility to actively express opinions publicly in Party newspapers, Party journals, and other Party publications and meetings, and participate in criticism to educate the masses.
    In order to strengthen the ideological leadership of this discussion and strengthen the ideological leadership of cultural and educational work, the Municipal Committee decided to regularly inspect various cultural and educational work, and instructed the leading responsible cadres of each cultural and educational unit to promptly convene internal and external symposia to reflect and concentrate various important opinions in cultural and educational work, and report to the Municipal Committee.

    The Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC convened responsible Party member cadres from cultural, educational, and news departments on the 23rd to specifically study and mobilize cultural workers, educators, and journalists to study the People's Daily editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" and related documents, and widely organize discussions to thoroughly clarify the confused thinking on this issue. Comrade Li Huasheng, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department, pointed out: The film "The Life of Wu Xun" has been shown in Tianjin for many days, and many of our cultural and educational propaganda departments have not only failed to conduct serious criticism; on the contrary, we have mistakenly and indiscriminately praised the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which has serious reactionary toxins. This shows the weakness of our ideological front and should arouse serious attention. At the meeting, everyone exchanged views on the specific methods of launching the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." First, the responsible cadres of each department should study conscientiously, and then, in light of the specific ideological situation of the general cadres, the responsible cadres should make reports to lead everyone to launch discussions.
    The main cadres of the Tianjin Education Bureau have scheduled to start discussing the film "The Life of Wu Xun" on the 25th, and hold an investigation meeting on the 26th to understand the understanding of "The Life of Wu Xun" in various schools, and then formulate a study and discussion plan for teachers and staff throughout the city. The study of teachers and staff throughout the city will begin next week and will last for one month. The Tianjin literary and art circles have held a meeting to study and discuss the documents criticizing the film "The Life of Wu Xun."

　　中共上海市委发出指示、天津市委宣传部召集会议
    号召党员参加电影《武训传》的讨论
    中国共产党上海市委员会于二十三日发布“关于开展对《武训传》的讨论的指示”，号召所属党的组织及党员，严肃认真地参加关于《武训传》的讨论。指示并规定了各项具体办法，以加强对于这一讨论的领导及改进对于文化教育工作的领导。
    指示称：这部电影是在上海摄制的，并首先在上海上映；但是负责领导上海宣传文化教育工作的干部，一直没有指出它的思想上、政治上严重的原则错误，并且有不少同志发表了歌颂与赞扬的意见。对于此种混乱错误的思想，市委也负有责任。因此，严肃认真地来开展对于这些错误思想的批判，并由此将所有党员的思想水平提高一步，乃是重要的政治任务。
    指示指出：开展这一讨论的目的，在于通过这一批判工作，学习无产阶级的世界观、辩证唯物论与历史唯物论的基本原则，学习共产主义与人民民主主义的基本内容：并掌握这种认识问题和分析问题的武器，对歌颂与赞扬污蔑中国农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史，污蔑中国民族的《武训传》的混乱错误思想进行批判，对自己的错误思想作认真严肃的自我批评，以提高党员的认识，阐明正确的观点与立场。指示规定：这一讨论，首先要立即在全市宣传、文化、教育工作岗位上的党员干部中进行。一般党员干部除目前仍以“镇压反革命”学习为中心外，可于此项中心学习开展后，与理论学习和党的生活有组织地进行。其他支部中的党员，除经常阅读报章上的有关评论进行学习外，可结合政治课、党课、团课进行必要的讨论与批判。指示规定：讨论与批判，可以党的小组为单位，在支部领导下进行；党委应注意向报纸上组织有关这方面的报道。每一个党员干部都有责任积极地在党报、党刊及其他党刊与会议上，公开发表意见，参加批判，以教育群众。
    为了加强对于这一讨论的思想领导及加强文化教育工作的思想领导，市委决定定期检查各项文化教育工作，并责成各文化教育单位的领导负责干部，迅即召开党内与党外的座谈会，随时反映与集中文化教育工作中的各项重要意见，并向市委报告。
                        （新华社）
    中共天津市委宣传部二十三日召集文化、教育、新闻等部门党员负责干部，具体研究发动文化工作者、教育工作者、新闻工作者学习人民日报社论“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”和有关文件，并广泛组织讨论，以求彻底澄清在这个问题上的混乱思想。宣传部副部长李华生同志指出：《武训传》电影在天津市上演多日，我们许多文教宣传部门不仅未能严肃地进行批判；相反的，对于有着严重的反动毒素的《武训传》电影，错误地没有立场地进行表扬，这说明我们思想战线的薄弱，应引起严重的注意。在会上，大家对开展《武训传》电影的讨论的具体方法，交换了意见，首先各部门的负责干部应认真地学习，然后针对一般干部的具体思想情况，由负责干部进行报告，领导大家展开讨论。
    天津教育局的主要干部，定二十五日开始讨论电影《武训传》，二十六日开调查会了解各学校对《武训传》的认识，然后再制订全市教职员的学习讨论计划。全市教职员的学习将在下星期一开始，学习时间为一个月。天津文艺界已开会研究讨论对电影《武训传》批评的文件。
