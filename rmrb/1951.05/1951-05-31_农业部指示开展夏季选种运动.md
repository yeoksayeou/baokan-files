Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government today issued instructions on launching a summer seed selection campaign. The instructions stated: Seed selection is the most effective measure to increase yield per unit area and an important part of carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign. Based on the experience of summer seed selection in various regions in 1950, the following suggestions are provided:

　　(1) Doing a good job in summer seed selection is an important task for agricultural departments at all levels. Therefore, responsible cadres of agricultural departments at all levels should personally lead this work. With the strong cooperation of mass organizations in various regions, they should arrange seed selection work through cadre meetings, labor model conferences, and other meetings, and regularly inspect, summarize, and exchange experiences. At the same time, short-term technical training classes should be opened to explain seed selection methods and their importance to strengthen the leadership of seed selection work.

　　(2) To launch a summer seed selection campaign, it is necessary to use examples of increased production due to seed selection among the masses, organize field visits and exhibitions of excellent varieties, and carry out comparative publicity and education among the masses to involve the vast number of farmers in the seed selection upsurge.

　　(3) The seed selection movement includes three aspects: selection, evaluation, and breeding. This year, regions that are not conducting evaluations should universally mobilize the masses to select seeds, retain seeds themselves, and exchange seeds; in evaluation regions, it is necessary to combine the universal mobilization of the masses to select seeds, the planned completion of evaluations, and the organization of farm breeding; in regions where evaluations have been completed, in addition to carrying out the breeding and promotion of improved varieties and sending them to provincial farms for testing according to the five-year improved variety popularization plan, the masses should continue to be mobilized to select and retain seeds themselves; at the same time, labor models and activists should be mobilized to collect and select special superior varieties and set up small farms in the fields for breeding experiments.

　　(4) Summer seed selection should focus on wheat. Evaluation work can be carried out with a focus on counties in areas with a good mass work foundation; counties that have only carried out village evaluations and have a small number of village seed selections should continue to carry out evaluations; in disaster areas, the main focus should be on mobilizing the masses to select seeds through mixing. The evaluation criteria should focus on three conditions: high yield, excellent quality, and resistance to disasters. In areas with severe wheat rust, varieties with strong rust resistance and high yield should be selected and retained; in areas with severe wheat midge, superior varieties that can resist and avoid wheat midge damage should be selected and retained; in spring wheat areas, early-maturing and relatively high-yielding varieties should be selected and bred.

　　农业部指示开展夏季选种运动
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府农业部今日发布关于开展夏季选种运动的指示。该指示称：选种工作是提高单位面积产量最有效的措施，同时也是开展爱国主义丰产竞赛运动的重要环节之一。现在根据一九五○年各地夏季选种工作的经验提供以下意见：
    （一）做好夏季选种工作，是目前各级农业部门的重要任务。因此，各级农业部门的负责干部应亲自领导这一工作，在各地群众团体的有力配合下，通过干部会、劳动模范会议及其他会议布置选种工作，定期检查，总结和交流经验。同时，还要开办短期技术训练班，讲述选种方法及其重要意义，以加强选种工作的领导。
    （二）开展夏季选种运动，必须运用群众中因选种而增产的实例，组织群众田间参观和优良品种展览等方法，向群众进行对比的宣传教育，使广大农民都卷入选种的热潮。
    （三）选种运动包括选、评、育三个内容。今年不进行评选的地区，要普遍发动群众进行选种，自行留种和换种；在评选地区，必须把普遍发动群众选种、有计划地完成评选和组织农场育种三个工作结合起来进行；在完成评选的地区，除根据五年良种普及计划进行良种的繁殖推广和送省农场试验外，应继续发动群众自行选种、留种；同时，还要发动劳动模范和积极分子采选特殊的优良品种，在田间设置小农场进行育种试验。
    （四）夏季选种应以小麦为主。评选工作，在群众工作基础较好的地区，可以县为单位有重点地进行；过去只进行了村评选和村选种数量不多的县份，仍应继续进行评选；在灾区，主要是发动群众混合选种。评选标准，以能丰产、品质优良和能抵抗灾害三个条件为主。在小麦锈病严重的地区，应选留抗锈病力强而能丰产的品种；在小麦吸浆虫严重的地区，应选留能抵抗和避免吸浆虫为害的优良品种；在春麦区，要选育早熟而又比较丰产的品种。
