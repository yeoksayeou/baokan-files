    Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily
    Anshan City Post Office's Self-Criticism Regarding the Restriction of Readers' Newspaper Cancellations

To the Editors:

　　We fully accept the criticism from Comrade Wang Shufeng of a certain unit in Anshan, published in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters" column on March 21, regarding our office's restriction on readers canceling newspaper subscriptions. After our investigation, based on the situation at the time, our office should have allowed the unit to cancel their subscription; however, due to the staff's fear of trouble, they unreasonably refused. This incident shows that the education of our staff by the leading cadres of our office is seriously inadequate. We must pay attention to strengthening cadre education in the future to prevent such incidents from happening again.

　　The unit only received the March 1st issue of the *Liaodong Dazhong* newspaper between March 1st and 4th because the unit did not contact the post office when it moved. The post office inquired through the transfer section during delivery and only located the unit after two or three days, which resulted in a backlog of newspapers. The corresponding number of newspapers has been reissued in full and were not lost.

                                    Anshan City Post Office

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应  安东市邮局关于限制读者退报问题的检讨

　　对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    安东市邮局关于限制读者退报问题的检讨编辑同志：
    三月二十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载安东某部王述凤同志对我局限制读者退订报纸一事的批评，我们完全接受。经我们检查，根据当时情况，我局是应该让该部退订报纸的；但由于经办人员怕麻烦，就无理地拒绝了。这件事情说明我局领导干部对工作人员的教育是十分不够的，今后一定要注意加强干部教育，使这种事情不再发生。
    该部三月一日至四日才见到一日的《辽东大众》报，这是因为该部迁移时没有与邮局联系；邮局送报时经转段查询，两三天才找到该部，所以报纸就积压了。该项报纸已照原数补发，并未丢失。
                    安东市邮局
