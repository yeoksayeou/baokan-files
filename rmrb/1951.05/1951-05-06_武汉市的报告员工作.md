　　Report Work in Wuhan City
    Du Zicai
    In early March, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party announced the list of municipal-level report personnel, totaling fifty-four individuals. This included members of the Municipal Committee, Party cadres at or above the level of bureau director in the Municipal Government, as well as the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the workers', youth, and women's committees, and key propaganda cadres. On March 24th, the Wuhan branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association invited the report personnel to go to factories, schools, and street neighborhoods to promote the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. By April 5th, in twelve days, a total of ninety-one reports were given, including: thirty-one in factories, twelve in schools, three in government offices, and forty-five among general laborers and residents. The total audience was 100,3802 people. Comrades Li Erzhong, Minister of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, and Zhao Min, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and others each gave three or more reports. Xie Bangzhi, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Wu Defeng, Mayor, and Zhou Jifang, Deputy Mayor, also went to designated factories and schools to give reports.
    The masses paid close attention to the reports given by the report personnel. When Song Ying, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, gave a report, it was originally planned for 300 people to attend; and despite the rain, over 800 people showed up. Workers at the Shenxin Textile Factory were overjoyed when they heard that Mayor Wu Defeng was coming to give a report, jumping up and down and requesting to stop work to listen, promising to make up for the lost time the next day. After listening to the report, everyone said, "Very good!" "Hope he comes more often." Many workers and citizens, after hearing the reports on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, deepened their understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. An old lady, after listening to a report, asked a cadre: "Has the female special agent who set fire to the Nanjing Hotel been caught?" She concluded emphatically, "That female special agent should be killed!" Residents of the Qiaokou area in the Second District, after listening to the report, immediately held a meeting to discuss the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and one citizen immediately reported an evil landlord who had fled from the countryside. Residents of Hanzhong Road, after discussing the report, proposed, "We guarantee that we will register with the police station if we have guests staying overnight; if the person doesn't report, the neighbors will report them."
    The method for the report personnel to carry out their work is to be responsible by district. The reporting areas for the report personnel were uniformly assigned by the Municipal Party Committee. The city's six districts and two directly subordinate factories (Jianghan Shipbuilding Company and Jiji Hydropower Company) were assigned report personnel according to the ratio of their area size. Each district then divided its area, factories, and schools into several reporting units, inviting the report personnel to give reports to the masses in each unit. This ensured that masses who had never heard reports before, especially street residents, could all hear them.
    The work of the municipal-level report personnel and the district-level report personnel is mutually coordinated; the main units are the responsibility of the municipal-level report personnel, and the secondary ones are the responsibility of the district-level report personnel. This ensures both a focus and allows the reporting work to be carried out quickly and comprehensively. To ensure good coordination, the work of the municipal-level report personnel assigned to each district should be uniformly controlled and distributed by the district party committee, with the municipal party committee responsible for promoting it.
    The work of the report personnel should also be closely integrated with the work of the propagandists and the members of the Resist America, Aid Korea branches. Before the report personnel give their reports, they should understand the situation and focus on the issues through the propagandists and the members of the Resist America, Aid Korea branches. After the report personnel give their reports, the propagandists and the members of the Resist America, Aid Korea branches should organize seminars, provide in-depth explanations, and collect opinions. The report personnel who gave reports in the directly subordinate factories in the Second District had good contact with the propagandists and the members of the Resist America, Aid Korea branches, so the effect was better.
    To ensure that the reports of the report personnel have good results, experience has shown that: (1) The content of the report should be combined with the ideological situation and living conditions of the masses. Before giving reports, Comrade Li Erzhong, Minister of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, Comrade Zhao Min, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and others would first talk to people in the factories to understand the situation; when reporting, they would address these situations and cite examples from the factory. This was very popular with the masses. However, some report personnel did not understand the ideological situation of the masses beforehand, and the content of the report could not be closely integrated with the ideological situation of the masses, so the masses did not like to listen to these reports. (2) The content of the report should be combined with the central work. After the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was raised, the masses urgently demanded to understand the principles and methods of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries must be carried out extensively by mobilizing the masses in a grand manner. Therefore, when the report personnel went to report on this issue, they were warmly supported by the broad masses. And the suppression of counter-revolutionaries quickly became a conscious action of the broad masses. The report personnel also established a very high prestige among the masses as a result. (3) The explanation of the report personnel should be combined with the audience's discussion. In some districts, after the report personnel gave their reports, the audience dispersed in a rush, and the effect of the report was unknown. However, in the Second District, after the report personnel gave their reports, they promptly organized seminars, guiding the masses to digest what they had heard and then take action. This is how Qiaokou and Hanzhong Road in that district were done well. In addition, the Party Committee's attention to the work of the report personnel is also important; the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee held a special discussion on the work of the report personnel, which made all the report personnel pay more attention to their work; the report personnel were very happy to accept the propaganda tasks. There is also the supervision of the report personnel's work by the newspaper. The Yangtze Daily often praised and criticized the work of the report personnel, thus promoting the progress of this work.
    The following shortcomings still exist in the report personnel work in Wuhan City: (1) The reports of the report personnel are still limited to the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and have not yet reported on other Party policies and various work experiences. Most report personnel can conscientiously prepare before giving reports and submit the report outline to the Party Committee Secretary for review. However, there are also individual report personnel who do not prepare an outline before giving reports and are not prepared enough. In addition, the system of reporting the effectiveness of the report to the Party Committee Secretary after the report has not yet been implemented. (2) Report personnel have not yet been universally established in each district, so the reporting tasks of the municipal-level report personnel are too heavy, and some give four consecutive reports in two days. This requires the universal establishment of report personnel at the district level, and the municipal-level report personnel only report to key factories, schools, and propagandists in the districts, with the general reports being the responsibility of the district-level report personnel.

### 武汉市的报告员工作

　　武汉市的报告员工作
    杜子才
    三月初，中共武汉市委公布了市级报告员名单，共五十四人，其中包括市委委员、市政府局长以上的党员干部及工、青、妇委正副书记、主要宣传干部等。三月二十四日，该市抗美援朝分会约请报告员分赴工厂、学校和街道里弄宣传镇压反革命政策；至四月五日，在十二天中，共作报告九十一次，计：工厂三十一次、学校十二次、机关三次、一般劳动群众与居民四十五次。听众共十万零三千八百零二人。而市委宣传部部长李尔重、市工会主席赵敏等同志都作过三次或三次以上的报告。市委副书记谢邦治、市长吴德峰、副市长周季方也都到指定区域的工厂、学校作过报告。
    群众对报告员的报告非常注意。市政府卫生局长宋瑛作报告，本来约定三百人来听；并且是雨天，结果到了八百多人。申新纱厂工人听到市长吴德峰来作报告的消息后，都高兴地跳起来，要求停车听报告，误的工明天补起来。听完报告后，大家都说“很好！”“希望多来几次。”许多工人和市民听过关于镇压反革命的报告后，对于镇压反革命的认识提高了一步。一个老太太听完报告问干部：“在南京饭店放火的那个女特务捉到了没有？”她最后肯切地说：“这个女特务该杀！”该市二区硚口居民听报告后即开会讨论镇压反革命问题，当场就有一个市民检举了从乡里逃来的恶霸地主。汉中路居民讨论报告后，提出“保证有客人过夜要去派出所登记；本人不报，邻居要检举”。
    报告员进行工作的办法是分区负责。报告员的报告区域是由市委统一分配的。全市六个区和两个直属工厂（江汉船舶公司和既济水电公司），按其区域大小的比例将报告员分配下去，各区再将本区按区域、工厂、学校分成若干报告单位，分请报告员对各单位群众进行报告。这样就能使从来听不到报告的群众，特别是街道居民，都可能听到报告了。
    市一级报告员的工作与区一级报告员的工作是互相配合的；主要的单位由市级报告员负责，次要的由区级报告员负责。这样既有重点，又可使报告工作迅速全面开展。为了使工作配合得好，分至各区的市级报告员的工作，应统一由区委掌握分配，市委负责推动。
    报告员的工作还要与宣传员及抗美援朝支会委员的工作密切相结合。报告员作报告之前，通过宣传员及抗美援朝支会委员了解情况，集中问题。报告员报告之后，再由宣传员及抗美援朝支会委员组织座谈，深入解释，收集意见。在二区直属工厂作报告的报告员与宣传员、抗美援朝支会委员的工作联系都较好，所以效果也较好。
    要使报告员的报告发生好的效果，经验证明：（一）报告内容要与群众思想情况，生活情况相结合。市委宣传部长李尔重、市工会主席赵敏等同志作报告之前，都先找工厂的人谈情况；报告时就针对这些情况来讲，并举出该工厂的例子。这样很受群众欢迎。但有的报告员不去事前了解群众思想情况，报告的内容也就不能密切结合群众思想情况，群众就不爱听这些报告。（二）报告内容要与中心工作相结合。镇压反革命问题提出后，群众迫切要求了解镇压反革命的方针与方法，而镇压反革命工作是必需广泛发动群众大张旗鼓地进行的。因此报告员去报告这问题时，就受到了广大群众热烈的拥护。并且镇压反革命很快成为广大群众的自觉行动。报告员工作也因此在群众中建立了极高的威信。（三）报告员的讲解要与听众座谈相结合。有的区报告员报告后，听众一哄而散，报告的效果如何就不得而知。而二区在报告员报告后，即及时组织座谈，引导群众把听到的东西溶化，并进而行动起来。该区的硚口和汉中路就是这样作好的。此外就是党委对报告员工作的重视问题；武汉市委对报告员工作作了专门讨论，因而使全体报告员更加重视自己工作；报告员就很高兴地接受了宣传任务。再有报纸对报告员工作的督促。长江日报经常对报告员工作进行表扬和批评，因此推动了这工作的一进展。
    武汉市报告员工作目前仍存在着如下缺点：（一）报告员的报告还只限于镇压反革命问题，对党的其他政策及各种工作经验还未进行过报告。大多数报告员在报告前，都能认真地进行准备，并将报告提纲送交党委书记审查。但也有个别报告员报告前不拟提纲，准备得不够充分。此外报告后，向党委书记汇报报告效果的制度也还未实行。（二）各区报告员尚未普遍建立，因此市级报告员的报告任务过重，有的在二天内连续作四次报告。这就要求区级普遍建立起报告员，市级报告员在区里只对重点工厂、学校和宣传员进行报告，一般的由区级报告员负责作报告。
