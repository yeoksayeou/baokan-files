I Received Education in the Discussion About "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Li Changzhi
    Editor's Note: Mr. Li Changzhi's article is a self-criticism of his article "The Movie 'The Life of Wu Xun' and the Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun" published in the Guangming Daily on February 26th. The main shortcoming of Mr. Li's article is that it completely ignored the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" and the "Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun," and believed that "the issue is not a single movie," while in fact, the discussion of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" is a more realistic issue than the discussion of Wu Xun himself. However, Mr. Li's attitude is sincere, much more so than Mr. Duan Benhongliang's letter in the previous issue of this journal. We welcome this kind of self-criticism.

　　When I was in elementary school in Shandong, I often heard stories about Wu Xun, and one of my teachers happened to be a graduate of Wu Xun Middle School, so the impression was particularly deep. And not just me. During the long period of widespread Wu Xun propaganda conducted by the reactionary ruling class in the past, I had already been captured by them ideologically.

    After seeing the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" and the "Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun," I felt that they were "still worth welcoming," and I became a captive of the ideology of this movie and pictorial biography.

    At the end of March and the beginning of April, I gradually saw some opposing articles, and at first, I thought they were just "trying to be different," and I didn't pay enough attention to them. When the issue of "uglifying the working people" was first raised, I thought that the uglification in the movie was one thing, and whether Wu Xun's actions were truly ugly was another, and I still wanted to defend Wu Xun, and even thought that kowtowing and begging might not be a kind of struggle, just as some authors at the time had similar views.

    It was not until I read Comrade Jia Ji's "Wu Xun Who is Not Worthy of Emulation," Comrade Yang Er's "A Tentative Discussion on Whether Mr. Tao Xingzhi's Praise of the 'Spirit of Wu Xun' Has Any Positive Effect," Comrade Wang Zengqi's "Wu Xun's Mistakes," etc., that I was liberated from many wrong ideas.

    The People's Daily's editorial on May 20th, "The Discussion of the Movie 'The Life of Wu Xun' Should Be Valued," is of profound significance and necessary, and has a role in improving the theoretical level of educators and literary and art workers. I am willing to enthusiastically respond to this call.
  My Self-Criticism
    (1) Fully exposes the lack of ability and habit to criticize traditional opinions: The spirit of bold doubt is not enough, and old ideological consciousness is actually regarded as a matter of course. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty praised Wu Xun, the landlords and bureaucrats praised Wu Xun, the Northern Warlords praised Wu Xun, the Kuomintang reactionaries praised Wu Xun… Why not analyze why they praised Wu Xun? Their praise had their reasons, and it also had a class basis, that is, Wu Xun's actions conformed to their interests. We should not follow their views. What is beneficial to them cannot be beneficial to the people. Such obvious facts are ignored due to ideological inertia.

    (2) The remnants of idealist thought have not been eradicated: Wu Xun's actions are welcomed by idealist philosophy because this is an excellent excuse. It says: Look, where there's a will, there's a way, and you don't have to care about the environment, and you don't have to rely on the masses, as long as you have a strong will, you can get whatever you want with your bare hands. If a beggar can set up a school, then can't someone with a slightly better life than a beggar do whatever they want? Of course, this is unscientific. Wu Xun was not really empty-handed. The reason why he could set up a school was because his actions conformed to the requirements of the reformist educational movement of the feudal landlord and bureaucratic class at that time, because he relied on the material assistance of those landlords (gentry), and because he had a set of practices that conformed to the moral standards of feudal society (the poor should be patient, should be kind, should be docile) (specifically, kneeling). Therefore, there is basically no miracle to speak of. However, idealists think that it is a material for publicizing "miracles"! This kind of "miracle" cannot withstand scientific analysis. People who affirm and praise Wu Xun's behavior have this kind of idealist thought at work imperceptibly. I am one of them. It is not accidental that the scene of hell appears in Mr. Sun Yu's movie. In fact, it is the manifestation of this extreme idealist thought.

    (3) Did not deeply investigate the questions that I doubted: In the materials about Wu Xun that I have come into contact with in the past, it was said that in addition to running schools, he often sold or lent "good books." Good books refer to "Wen Chang Dijun Wen", "Yinzhi Wen", etc. I often talked to friends, saying that Wu Xun also had a backward side. But this issue should not be let go. Because if we check, Wu Xun can be said to have served the feudal ruling class from beginning to end. He did not violate feudal morality in the slightest, nor did he ever have this intention; just as he did not violate the foundation of feudal society—the economic relations of landlord exploitation—in the slightest, nor did he ever have this intention. Running schools and selling and lending "good books" are just the same manifestation of maintaining feudal rule. I suspected his propaganda of "good books," but I didn't suspect his running schools, which was not thorough.

    (4) Ignored "Social practice is the criterion for testing subjective wishes, and effect is the criterion for testing motives" (Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art): Praising Wu Xun means not looking at it from social practice, and not looking at it from the effect. The reason why the articles of Comrades Jia Ji and Yang Er are correct is because they are "dialectical materialists who unify motive and effect."

    (5) Ignored "Putting political criteria in the first place and artistic criteria in the second place" (Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art): Most of my previous literary criticism work has made this mistake. I wanted to work hard to overcome it, but now this review proves that it has not been overcome. I commented too much on the art of the Wu Xun movie and the Wu Xun pictorial biography, and touched the political significance too lightly and too faintly (and incorrectly). This inevitably leads to a purely technical viewpoint, and inevitably the influence of Western bourgeois "art for art's sake" formalism aesthetics. Because of the lack of sufficient emphasis on political significance, even the criticism of artistic standards is wrong. For example, I pointed out that the "liveliness and romantic lyricism" of the Wu Xun movie "did not improve its artistry, but on the contrary, reduced it," but the reason is: "It damages the seriousness of Wu Xun's career." In fact, Wu Xun's career has no value at all, so there is no question of damaging or not damaging its seriousness. It can be seen that without putting politics in the first place, artistic criticism will not be correct.

    (6) Ignored that literary and art criticism work should focus on today instead of yesterday: This issue specifically concerns "The Life of Wu Xun," that is, we must first ask, what is the significance of such a film for today? In vast areas of China, peasants have been freed from the shackles of feudal exploitation since land reform. They already have the opportunity to love culture and learn culture. Why put the cart before the horse and raise the issue of literacy? It is not that you can turn over only after you are literate, but that you can become literate only after you have turned over! In a scientific era, in an era when everything can be explained by scientific laws, what is the significance of promoting characters who were regarded as miracles in the feudal society? Isn't this a retrogression? In an era of collectivism, in an era of correct leadership, what is the significance of promoting such legendary individualistic heroes, and promoting the deeds of such spontaneous and not well-thought-out characters? In an era when the New Democratic Revolution has already achieved victory and is consolidating this victory, what is the significance of promoting a mysterious reformist path from the feudal society? These cannot withstand questioning. - No wonder the little friend in Mr. Lu Xun's article wanted to "open his eyes wide" and ask questions!
            Through this discussion, I have clarified some issues
    (1) The issue of "The Life of Wu Xun" is not about a movie, but about Wu Xun himself and his activities. Only with a correct criticism of Wu Xun himself can we talk about the movie.

    (2) Wu Xun served the feudal ruling class from beginning to end, and his path was a reformist path that was harmful to the people, not a revolutionary path that was beneficial to the people.

    (3) Wu Xun's behavior was already unworthy of emulation at that time. Because at that time, there was clearly a truly revolutionary road like the Taiping Army, but he did not take it, but took the opposite road.

    (4) Wu Xun's behavior is especially unnecessary to be praised now. Not only is it unnecessary, but it is also harmful. Because this will encourage people to worship blind individual heroism, which will blur people's understanding of the real needs of peasants, which will make people go backwards, which will distort the truly precious revolutionary qualities of the Chinese people, and which will cause greater and more ideological confusion among people who are not clear about the situation.

    (5) When ideological confusion has already appeared, it is necessary to clarify these confusions under leadership. In general, this helps to solve the problem of critically accepting historical heritage; specifically, it can improve the editing, directing, shooting, and criticism of biographical films.

    (6) The most confusing Wu Xun spirit—the spirit of being able to persist without force or courage—has been raised by Comrade Yang Er that it should be judged by "whether it can promote the progress of history," and therefore is negative. I think this issue has been resolved.
            Other Issues and Tentative Solutions
    In the process of discussion, I still had several questions, and now I feel that I have approached a solution through enlightenment and consideration. These are:

    (1) Considering Wu Xun's running schools as a literacy movement for the liberation of the working people (I once agreed with this view), I now clearly know that it is wrong. But if we think that Wu Xun's running schools was a movement with the emerging bourgeoisie's educational movement in the late Qing Dynasty (Wu Xun died in 1896, two years before the Wuxu Coup), is that possible? Does this broad educational movement have progressive significance? My current view is that there are still differences between them, and even if it is regarded as a broad movement, the progressive significance is very small. Because, the educational movement of the emerging bourgeoisie at that time also included an important content, that is, the import of "Western learning," in other words, it required absorbing a part of the culture of the Western bourgeoisie to a certain extent, which can be seen by reading Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's "Selected Writings of the Late Qing Dynasty." However, the content of Wu Xun's running schools is still limited to the inheritance of feudal culture. That is to say, even within the scope of the educational movement, Wu Xun's running schools was also a backward branch.

    (2) Comrade Yang Er's criticism of the so-called spirit of Wu Xun is correct. But what he refers to is only the aspect of asceticism. The spirit of Wu Xun in general also has the aspect of "selflessness." I think this aspect is even more confusing. My current understanding is: selflessness depends on what kind of "people" it is "for"? And we must see what purpose he wants to achieve in being "for" others? On the surface, Wu Xun's selflessness is for the poor, for those who cannot afford tuition, so it is called an "righteous school". However, in fact, since it is promoting feudal culture and maintaining feudal rule, the result is not really for the poor, but for the feudal ruling class. Furthermore, what kind of way out can these poor people have through his righteous schools? It is nothing more than climbing up, getting promoted and becoming rich, and producing a group of new landlords and bureaucrats. Therefore, if we look at it in connection with the specific effects at that time (instead of looking at it abstractly), his selflessness is also harmful. The paths that people like Wu Xun could have taken are: (1) revolution; (2) becoming a robber or thief; (3) living peacefully, that is, begging for life; (4) building a career through their own hard work; (5) focusing on running schools. In terms of effect, the worst is the last way out, which is the way he chose. Because, revolution is of course the best way, robbers or thieves also cause some damage to feudal landlords, begging for life has the least impact on society, building a career is just a model for a few people to endure hardship and climb up, but running schools has dazzled many people, and provided the feudal ruling class with excellent materials for deceptive propaganda, prolonging the life of the feudal ruling force to some extent, and obscuring the road for peasants to achieve true liberation. Since the consequences of his running schools are like this, his "selflessness" is also bankrupt.

    Whether the above views still have problems, please advise!

### 我在关于《武训传》的讨论中获得了教育

专栏：

　　我在关于《武训传》的讨论中获得了教育
    李长之
    编者按：李长之先生的文章是对于他在二月二十六日光明日报发表的《武训传电影和武训画传》一文的自我批评。李先生这篇文章的主要缺点是完全忽视了电影《武训传》和《武训画传》，并且认为“重要的不是一部电影的问题”，而事实上电影《武训传》的讨论却是一个比武训本人的讨论更为现实的问题。但是李先生的态度是诚恳的比端本蕻良先生在本刊上期的信件要诚恳得多。我们欢迎这种自我批评。
    我在山东读小学时，即常听关于武训的故事，而那时的一位先生又逢巧是武训中学毕业的，所以印象特别深。也不止我。在过去反动统治阶级长期进行广大的武训宣传的时候，我在思想上早已作了他们的俘虏。
    看到电影《武训传》和《武训画传》后，我觉得它们“仍是值得欢迎的”，我又作了这部电影和画传的思想的俘虏。
    三月底，四月初，渐渐看到一些反面的文章，最初认为不过是“标奇立异”罢了，没加以足够的注意。“丑化劳动人民”的问题初提出来，我当时认为电影中的丑化是一回事，武训的举动是否真丑又是一回事，还想为武训辩护，甚而认为叩头乞请也未必不是一种斗争方式，正如当时有些作者也有的同类见解。
    直到读到贾霁同志的《不足为训的武训》、杨耳同志的《试谈陶行知先生表扬〈武训精神〉有无积极作用》、汪曾祺同志的《武训的错误》等文，才使我从许多错误思想里解放出来。
    人民日报五月二十日的社论“应当重视电影武训传的讨论”，是有深刻意义和必要的，对于教育工作者、文艺工作者的理论水平都有提高的作用。我愿意热烈地响应这一个号召。
  我的检讨
    （一）充分暴露对传统的意见缺乏批判的能力和习惯：大胆怀疑的精神太不够，把旧的思想意识竟视为当然。过去满清的统治者表扬武训，地主官僚表扬武训，北洋军阀表扬武训，国民党反动派表扬武训，……为什么不去分析一下他们为什么表扬武训呢？他们的表扬是有他们的理由的，也是有阶级基础的，这就是，武训的行动符合了他们的利益。我们却不该顺了他们的眼光走。对于他们有利的，不可能对人民也有利。这样明显的事实，却由思想的惰性而忽略了。
    （二）唯心论思想的残余没有肃清：武训的举动是唯心论的哲学所欢迎的，因为这是绝好的一种借口。说：你看，有志者事竟成，也不必管环境，也不必靠群众，只要有坚强的意志就可以赤手空拳，要什么有什么。叫化还可以设学校，那么，比叫化的生活好一点的人不是要做什么都可以如愿么？当然，这是不科学的。武训并不是真的赤手空拳，他所以能办学校，是靠了他的行动符合了当时封建地主官僚阶级的改良主义的兴学运动的要求，是靠了那些地主（士绅）的物质的援助，是靠了他那一套符合封建社会道德标准（穷人应该忍辱，应该和气，应该驯服）的做法（具体的就是下跪）。所以，这也根本没有什么奇迹可言。可是唯心论者却以为是大可宣传“奇迹”的材料了！这种“奇迹”原经不住科学的分析的。肯定并赞扬武训的行为的人，无形中是有这种唯心论的思想在作怪。我也是其中的一个。孙瑜先生的电影中出现了地狱的场面，并不是偶然的，其实正是这种极端的唯心论思想的发挥。
    （三）对自己所怀疑的问题没有深刻追究：在我已往所接触的关于武训的材料中，曾有说他除了兴学之外，又常卖《善书》或出借《善书》的话。善书是指《文昌帝君文》《阴骘文》等。我也常和朋友谈起，说，可见武训也有落后的一面。可是应当不放过这个问题才对。因为我们试一检查，武训可说是彻头彻尾为封建统治阶级服务的。他没有丝毫触犯封建道德，也从没有这个意思；正如他没有丝毫触犯封建社会的基础——地主剥削的经济关系，也从没有这个意思。兴学和售借《善书》，不过是维持封建统治一事的同一表现而已。我怀疑到他的宣传《善书》，可是没怀疑到他的兴学，这是没彻底处。
    （四）忽视了“社会实践是检验主观愿望的标准，效果是检验动机的标准”（毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话）：赞扬武训就是没从社会实践去看，没从效果去看。贾霁和杨耳二同志的文章之所以是正确的，就是因为他们是“辩证唯物主义的动机与效果的统一论者”。
    （五）忽视了“以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位”（毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话）：我已往的文艺批评工作多半犯这个错误，本想努力克服，但现在这篇评论就证明实在还没有克服掉。我过多地评论了武训传电影和武训画传的艺术，太轻太淡地（而且不正确地）触及了政治意义。这不免是单纯技术观点，这不免是西方资产阶级“艺术至上”的形式主义的美学的影响。因为缺乏对政治意义的足够的重视，所以就是就艺术标准的批评论，也就犯了错误。例如我指出武训电影之“热闹和罗曼谛克的抒情并没有提高了它的艺术性，反之，是降低了它”，然而理由呢，是：“损害了武训事业的严肃性”。其实，武训事业根本没有什么价值，也就说不上损害不损害它的严肃性了。可见不把政治性放在第一位，艺术性的批评是不会正确的。
    （六）忽视了文艺批评工作应当把眼光放在今天而不应当放在昨天：这问题具体到“武训传”上就是，我们要首先问对于今天说，这样的片子有什么意义？中国广大地区的农民已经因为土地改革以后，把封建剥削的枷锁解除了，他们已经可以有着热爱文化，学习文化的机会了，又何必把本末倒置的识字问题提出来？不是识了字才能翻身，是翻了身才能识字呀！在科学的时代，在一切都可以用科学规律解释的时代，宣扬这封建社会时代所视为奇迹的人物有什么意义呢？这不是开倒车么？在集体主义的时代，在有着正确领导的时代，宣扬这种传奇式的个人英雄主义的人物，宣扬这种自发的没有想透彻的人物的事迹有什么意义呢？在新民主主义的革命已经取得胜利并在巩固这种胜利的时代，宣扬封建社会时代的一种莫明其妙的改良主义的路子有什么意义呢？这都是经不住追问的。——无怪乎鲁迅先生的文章中的那个小朋友要“睁圆了眼睛”发问了！
            通过这次讨论，让我明确了一些问题
    （一）武训传的问题，重要的不是一部电影的问题，而是武训这个人和他的活动的问题。只有对武训本人有正确的批判，才能谈电影。
    （二）武训是彻头彻尾为封建统治阶级服务的，他的道路是对人民有害的改良主义的道路，而不是对人民有利的革命的道路。
    （三）武训的行为，在当时已经是不足为训的。因为，当时明明已经有着象太平军真正革命的道路，而他没有走，走的乃是相反的道路。
    （四）武训的行为，在现在尤其没有歌颂的必要。不但没有必要，而且有害。因为，这会鼓励人崇拜盲目的个人英雄主义，这会模糊人对于农民的真正需要的认识，这会使人开倒车，这会使人歪曲了中国人民真正宝贵的革命品质，这会使认识不清的人造成更大更多的思想混乱。
    （五）在业已呈现思想混乱的时候，有领导地把这些混乱澄清是必要的。大之，这有助于批判地接受历史遗产问题的解决；小之，在传记片的编导摄制和批评上都可以提高一步。
    （六）最容易迷惑人的武训精神——无拳无勇而能够坚持的精神，已由杨耳同志提出应该用“是否能推动历史前进这个标准来判断”，因而是否定的，我认为这个问题是已经解决了。
            其余的问题及其试探的解决
    在讨论的过程中，我自己是还存在着几个问题的，我现在觉得也经过启发和考虑而逼近解决。这是：
    （一）把武训的兴学认为是劳动人民的翻身识字运动（我曾同意这个看法），现在明确地知道是错误了。可是如果认为武训的兴学是和清末（武训死于一八九六年，就是戊戌政变的前二年）的新兴资产阶级的兴学运动是一个运动是不是可以呢？这个广泛的兴学运动有没有进步意义呢？我现在的看法是：这其间依然有着区别，而且纵然当作一个广泛的运动看，进步的意义也是很少的。因为，当时一般新兴资产阶级的兴学运动还包括一个重要内容，那就是输入“西学”，换言之，那就是在某种程度上是要求吸收西洋资产阶级的文化的一部分，这是一读郑振铎先生编的《晚清文选》就可看出的。但是武训兴学的内容，却仍然是拘限于封建文化的承袭。这就是说，就是在兴学运动的范围以内论，武训的兴学，也是落后的一支。
    （二）杨耳同志对于所谓武训精神的批判是对的。但他所指的，只是苦行的一方面。普通所谓武训精神，还有“舍己为人”的一方面。我认为这一方面更是容易迷惑人的。我现在的理解是：舍己为人，要看“为”的是什么“人”？并要看他为“人”是要达到什么目的？在现象上看，武训的舍己为人是为穷人，是为出不起学费的人，所以才叫义学。然而事实上，既然是宣传封建文化，维持封建统治，所以结果并没有真正为了穷人，而是为了封建统治阶级。再说，通过他的义学，这些穷人可能有什么出路呢？不过往上爬，升官发财，产生一批新的地主官僚就是了。所以，如果同当时的具体效果连系起来看（而不是抽象地看），他的舍己为人也是有害的。象武训这样的人，可能走的路子是：（一）革命；（二）当强盗或小偷；（三）安分守己也就是行乞终身；（四）凭自己的勤苦，成家立业；（五）一心兴学。就效果论，最坏的是后一出路，也就是他选择的出路。因为，革命不必说是最好的路，强盗或小偷也多少对封建地主有些损害，行乞终身可说对社会影响最小，成家立业则不过给少数人做一个忍辱吃苦往上爬的榜样，独独兴学却眩惑了不少人，给了封建统治阶级绝好的欺骗宣传的材料，多少延长了封建统治势力的寿命，并蒙蔽了农民不能求得真正解放的道路。他的兴学的后果如此，他的“舍己为人”也就跟着破产了。
    以上的看法，是否还有问题，请读者指教！
