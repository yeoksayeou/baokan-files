　　Exchanging Experiences to Cultivate Technical Talent
　　Tianjin Establishes Technical Research Association
　　The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions convened a city-wide representative conference of industrial technology workers on April 28th and 29th. The conference summarized the experiences of various professional technical research associations over the past nine months and established the Tianjin Technical Research General Association.

　　Starting in July of last year, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial trade unions successively convened nine professional meetings on boilers, sand casting, rubber, tobacco, flour, steam turbine generators, machinery, electrical engineering, and textiles, and established permanent technical research associations. Many engineers, technical workers, and veteran technicians with technical skills and prestige were organized into technical research associations to take on leadership roles. Over the past nine months, the technical research associations have held various special technical lectures and seminars, assisted factories in improving technology, and organized visits for mutual learning, achieving great results. For example, after the establishment of the Boiler Technology Research Association, it assisted factories in improving boiler equipment, greatly reducing coal consumption. In the city's twenty-four larger factories alone, 3,700 tons of coal were saved from July to September of last year. The Steam Turbine Generator Technology Research Association sent members of the association to specifically help the private Beiyang Yarn Factory repair a generator that had been out of operation for thirteen or fourteen years, increasing the factory's power. The various technical research associations held a total of forty-three technical lectures, with over 3,300 attendees; these lectures further improved the technical skills of the workers.

　　The newly established Tianjin Technical Research General Association will further unite the vast number of technical workers, exchange technical experiences, carry out mass technical learning, improve the technical level of existing technical personnel, cultivate new technical talents, and prepare conditions for large-scale economic construction in the future.

　　交流经验培养技术人才
    天津成立技术研究会
    天津市总工会在四月二十八、二十九两日，召开了全市工业技术工作者代表大会。会议总结了九个月来各专业技术研究会的经验，并成立了天津市技术研究总会。
    从去年七月开始，天津市总工会和各产业工会曾先后召开了锅炉、翻砂、橡胶、烟草、面粉、汽轮发电机、机械、电工、纺织等九个专业会议，并建立了经常性的技术研究会。许多有技术、有威信的工程师、技术工作者、老技工等，被组织在技术研究会里担任了领导工作。九个多月以来，各技术研究会曾举办各种专题技术讲座和座谈会，协助各厂改进技术，并组织参观，互相学习，有很大成绩。例如锅炉技术研究会成立后，即协助各厂改进锅炉设备，使煤耗大大降低，仅全市二十四个较大工厂，去年七月到九月就节省了三千七百吨煤。汽轮发电机技术研究会曾派该会委员具体帮助私营北洋纱厂修复了一部停开了十三、四年的发电机，增加了该厂的动力。各技术研究会举办的技术讲座共有四十三次，听讲人数达三千三百余人；通过这些讲座，进一步提高了工人的技术水平。
    此次成立的天津市技术研究总会，将进一步团结广大的技术工作者，交流技术经验，开展群众性的技术学习，以提高现有技术人员的技术水平，培养新的技术人才，为今后大规模经济建设准备条件。
