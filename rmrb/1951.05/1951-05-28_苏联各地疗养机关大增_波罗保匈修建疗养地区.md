The Soviet government has allocated more than 300 million rubles for the construction of the Caucasian spa region since the war. There are now one hundred sanatoriums there, accommodating a total of 225,000 people last year. In the Georgian spa region, many new sanatoriums, rest homes, medical institutions, and hotels have been opened to welcome more than 400,000 workers from all over the Soviet Union for their vacations. In the suburbs of Leningrad, such as Peterhof and Sestroretsk, first-class rest homes and sanatoriums have been opened. A new sanatorium region has emerged in the Karelian Isthmus.
