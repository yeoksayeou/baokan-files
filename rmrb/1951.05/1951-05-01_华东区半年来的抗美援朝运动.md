　　The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in East China Region over the Past Six Months
        Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the East China region began last year. At that time, the focus of the movement was in large and medium-sized cities. With the liberation of Pyongyang, the first upsurge of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in East China was launched. The main contents of this period were: First, to carry out a movement to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism. In Shanghai alone, more than 1,360 facts were exposed. Second, church schools launched struggles against insults and defamation, starting with the denunciation of American professor and imperialist element Miss Fair of Ginling Women's College in Nanjing, which was followed by responses from church schools in various places. Third, the peak of the movement during this period was the action of young students and workers joining military cadre schools. A total of 101,726 students and 12,490 workers in East China registered. In addition, 1,326 truck drivers and 1,140 medical workers volunteered to serve on the Korean front. Fourth, during this period, business circles, university professors, and religious circles also participated in the movement, successively holding parades, demonstrations, accusation meetings, and formulating patriotic pacts. For example, in Shanghai, 120,000 people from business circles and 3,000 university professors held parades; in Nanjing, 1,800 Christians held meetings to denounce the crimes of American imperialism, and launched a movement to reject American films and oppose listening to the "Voice of America." Fifth, during this period, workers launched patriotic production competitions. Farmers mainly concentrated their efforts on completing land reform.

    The second upsurge of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in East China came after the launch of the movement against the United States arming Japan. The main contents of this movement included: First, parades, demonstrations, and accusation meetings with the central slogan of opposing the United States rearming Japan. According to incomplete statistics, 10,760,000 people in East China participated in parades and demonstrations. Among them, Zhejiang Province alone had 5,370,000 people participating in parades; in Yancheng County, Subei, 110 out of 148 townships held parades, with a total of more than 55,000 farmers participating. In Hang County, Zhejiang, 160,000 out of more than 300,000 people in the county participated in accusations. The Sunan broadcasting accusation meeting organized 500,000 people to listen at one time. Second, launching movements to comfort the Chinese and Korean soldiers and relieve Korean refugees. According to incomplete statistics at the end of March, East China donated a total of 47.99 billion yuan in lieu of goods, wrote 383,758 letters of condolences, donated 438,269 items of comfort goods, and 289,785 comfort bags. Third, carrying out movements to formulate patriotic pacts. Three-fifths of the citizens of Shanghai expressed their support for the joint patriotic pact of the people from all walks of life in the city through signatures and other means, and more than 80,000 large and small units formulated their own specific patriotic pacts. Among the 2,098 neighborhood residents' groups in Wuxi City, 1,200 groups have already formulated patriotic pacts. In Xindeng County, Zhejiang, 17,450 households (accounting for 90% of the total households in the county) formulated patriotic production plans. Fourth, the peak of the movement during this period was reflected in the large-scale army enlistment movement of the vast number of farmers in East China. In Songjiang Prefecture, Sunan, about 80% of the population was involved in this movement. In Xindeng County, Zhejiang, more than 10,000 people voluntarily signed up, accounting for one-seventh of the total population. Fifth, the movement during this period promoted the current practical work of all classes: On the workers' side, 2,337 groups have challenged the Ma Hengchang group, and 290,000 workers have participated in the patriotic production competition. On the farmers' side, 242 groups in Shandong and 50 groups in Zhejiang have challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid group. In Jiading County, Sunan, through the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, cotton planting has increased to 70% of the total cultivated land. Farmers are placing signs everywhere in the fields, writing "planting 'Resist America cotton' on several mu, and planting 'Patriotic cotton' on several mu." In Lengjian Township, Mengcheng, Northern Anhui, Hou Xingmin's squad of Huai River construction workers formulated seven patriotic pacts, increasing the amount of earth excavated from 2.6 cubic meters per day to 6.5 cubic meters. In the vast rural areas, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement solved three major problems: First, it promoted the completion of grain requisitioning and army enlistment; second, it inspected the land reform and consolidated the emancipated status; and third, it promoted the formulation of patriotic production plans. On the students' side, the main focus was to shift to carrying out patriotic education from regular classes. On the business side, a movement against speculation, arrears, and false reporting, and paying taxes according to regulations was launched. Twenty-seven counties and cities and more than eighty towns in Sunan carried out collective tax payment movements. Religious circles also held parades and demonstrations, focusing on carrying out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. 68,000 Christians signed the Renewal Manifesto, and more than 20,000 patriotic activists among Catholics have now signed the Renewal Manifesto.

    The Resist America, Aid Korea movement has had a huge impact on the thinking of the vast number of people in the East China region. "American devils" and "American bastards" have become catchphrases and have become synonymous with "bad guys." No one says anything good about the United States anymore. If they do, they will be "chased and beaten like rats crossing the street." People who did not have enough awareness and did not hate American imperialism also grit their teeth because it was rearming Japan. "Not suffering a second time" has become a common slogan. "Loving the motherland," "opposing the United States," "opposing the landlord class," and "opposing counter-revolutionary elements" have begun to form a kind of social morality. In many factories, if someone's work is not done well, someone nearby will criticize them, saying, "How are you resisting America and aiding Korea?" From these aspects, it can be seen that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has become a driving force for all work.

　　华东区半年来的抗美援朝运动
        中共中央华东局宣传部
    华东区抗美援朝运动自去年开始。当时运动的重点是在大中城市。至平壤解放，即发起华东区抗美援朝的第一个高潮。这一时期的主要内容为：一、开展控诉美帝国主义暴行运动。单上海一地就揭发了一千三百六十多件事实。二、教会学校开展反侮辱反诽谤斗争，从南京金陵女子文理学院控诉美籍教授帝国主义分子费睿思开始，各地教会学校纷起响应。三、这一时期运动的高峰是青年学生和工人参加军事干部学校的行动，全华东区有十万零一千七百二十六名学生和一万二千四百九十名工人报了名。另有一千三百二十六个汽车司机，一千一百四十个医务工作者自愿赴朝鲜前线服务。四、这一时期，工商界、大学教授和宗教界也参加了运动，陆续举行游行示威、集会控诉和订立爱国公约，如上海即有工商界十二万人、大学教授三千人举行游行；南京有基督徒一千八百人集会控诉美帝国主义罪行，并掀起拒映美国影片及反对收听“美国之音”的运动。五、这一时期，工人开展了爱国生产竞赛。农民主要是集中力量完成土地改革。
    华东区抗美援朝运动的第二个高潮是在开展了反对美国武装日本的运动以后。这一运动的主要内容包括：一、以反对美国重新武装日本为中心口号的游行示威和集会控诉运动，据不完全统计全华东有一千零七十六万群众参加游行示威。其中浙江一省即达五百三十七万人参加游行；苏北盐城县一四八个乡中有一一○个乡举行了游行，共有农民五万五千余人参加，浙江杭县全县三十多万人中有十六万人参加了控诉，苏南广播控诉大会，一次即组织了五十万人收听。二、发动慰问中朝战士和救济朝鲜难民运动，据三月底不完全的统计，全华东共捐献代金四百七十九亿九千余万元，写慰问信三十八万三千七百五十八封，捐献慰劳品四十三万八千二百六十九件，慰问袋二十八万九千七百八十五个。三、开展订立爱国公约运动。上海市五分之三的市民用签名和其他方式表示拥护全市各界人民共同爱国公约，并有八万多个大小单位分别订立了各自具体的爱国公约。无锡市里弄居民二千○九十八个小组中，已有一千二百个组订立了爱国公约。浙江新登县有一万七千四百五十户（占全县总户口百分之九十）订立了爱国生产计划。四、这一时期运动的最高峰表现在全华东广大农民的大规模参军运动。苏南松江专区约有百分之八十的人口卷入这一运动。浙江新登县自动报名的达一万余人，占总人口七分之一。五、这一时期的运动推动了各阶级当前的实际工作：工人方面，已有二千三百三十七个小组向马恒昌小组应战，参加爱国生产竞赛的工人已有二十九万人。农民方面，山东已有二百四十二个组，浙江已有五十个组向李顺达互助组应战。苏南嘉定县通过抗美援朝运动植棉增至占全部耕地的百分之七十，农民在田里到处插着牌子，写种“抗美棉”几亩，种“爱国棉”几亩。皖北蒙城冷涧乡治淮民工侯兴民班订出七条爱国公约，挖土方从每日二方六提高到六方五。广大农村中通过抗美援朝运动解决了三大问题：一是推动完成征粮和参军；二是检查了土地改革，巩固了翻身；三是推动订立了爱国生产计划。学生方面，主要是转入从经常正课中进行爱国主义学习。工商界方面展开反投机、反拖欠、反瞒报，按章纳税运动，苏南有二十七个县、市及八十多个市镇开展了集体纳税运动。宗教界也举行了游行示威，并着重于开展三自运动，基督教徒在革新宣言上签名者达六万八千人，天主教徒中的爱国积极分子，现已有二万余人在革新宣言上签名。
    抗美援朝运动已使华东区广大人民的思想起了巨大影响。“美国鬼子”“美国赤佬”已为口头禅，并成为一种“坏蛋”的代名词，谁也不说美国好了，说了，就会“老鼠过街，人人喊打”。因觉悟不够对美帝国主义没有仇恨的人，也因为它重新武装日本而咬牙切齿。“不受二遍罪”已成为普遍的口号，“爱祖国”，“反美”、“反对地主阶级”、“反对反革命分子”，已开始形成为一种社会道德。许多工厂中，如果谁的工作做不好，旁边就会有人批评他说：“你抗美援朝是怎样抗的？”从这些方面可以看出，抗美援朝运动已成为一切工作的推动力量。
