Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The national General Cooperative has successfully piloted rationing in some grassroots cooperatives this first quarter. A total of 14 billion yuan worth of goods were rationed, benefiting 700,000 members. The prices of rationed goods in cities are generally about 10% lower than market retail prices, and in rural areas, about 15% lower. The rationed price of kerosene is even 20% to 40% lower than the market retail price. Therefore, the rationing system has been warmly welcomed by the majority of members and has had a great impact. In the second quarter, the number of members applying for rationing benefits has reached 7 million, excluding the Northeast region.

The results of this pilot rationing program have proven that the rationing system is a powerful guarantee for getting cooperatives on the right track. In January of this year, the National General Cooperative issued the "Provisional Measures for Cooperative Rationing in the First Quarter of 1951," stipulating that grassroots cooperatives must meet the following four conditions to enjoy rationing benefits: 1. Engage in consumer business and purchase goods according to the needs of members; except for slow-moving goods, retail sales are only to members, not to non-members. 2. Keep clear accounts, settle accounts on time, and publish them to members on time. 3. Submit accounting and statistical reports to the county and city cooperative federations on time, and have monthly or quarterly retail plans. 4. The directors and supervisors of the cooperative are elected by the members, not appointed by higher authorities; the board of directors, the supervisory board, and the members' representative assembly hold meetings on time and faithfully implement the resolutions of these meetings, truly serve the members, and enjoy prestige among the members. The promulgation of this regulation triggered a mass movement to rectify cooperatives. Many cooperative members, in order to obtain rationing benefits, voluntarily rose up to help the cooperative get on the right track. At the same time, most areas of the grassroots cooperatives conducted serious evaluations based on the above four conditions, which greatly strengthened the determination of cooperative cadres to rectify the cooperatives. The Tianjin No. 2 Garment Factory Consumer Cooperative was not selected in the first evaluation. Zhao Huibin, the director of the cooperative, took off the production model medal hanging on his chest on the spot, saying that he would wear it again after leading his cooperative to obtain rationing benefits. The Nanguan Consumer Cooperative in Kaifeng City was not doing well, and the members demanded its dissolution, but after hearing about the implementation of the rationing system, they immediately demanded rectification and no longer demanded dissolution.

In the first quarter of the pilot rationing program, some shortcomings and difficulties also occurred. In terms of evaluation, some cooperative work cadres in some areas did not study the General Cooperative's instructions on the rationing system, did not conduct evaluation work, and simply relied on "decisions from higher authorities," so they could not check the good or bad of the work of the grassroots cooperatives, and therefore could not propose plans to improve the cooperatives. Other cooperatives mechanically understood the provisions stipulated in the rationing method during the evaluation, and nitpicked on trivial issues, so that some better grassroots cooperatives did not receive rationing benefits. In addition, the four rationing conditions stipulated by the National General Cooperative lacked conditions suitable for rural supply and marketing cooperatives. In terms of the quantity of rationed goods, because the purchasing power of urban workers and peasants, as well as the purchasing power between workers and workers, and between farmers and farmers, are different, the current quantitative allocation of rationed goods cannot fully meet the requirements of members. For example, the quota for cloth is seven feet, which is inconvenient for members to use. Rationing procedures are also not simple enough.

In order to improve the rationing work in the second quarter, the National General Cooperative has issued instructions to cancel the unified rationing certificate and change the quantitative allocation to a limited quantity, so that members can freely purchase within the limited standard. The instructions also made the following explanations on the conditions for evaluating cooperatives to enjoy rationing benefits:

1.  Should wholeheartedly serve the members, meet the needs of the members, overcome the pure profit-seeking ideology, cancel market transactions unrelated to the members, and do not mechanically propose "no transactions with non-members." 2. In terms of business operations, a supply plan should be made according to the needs of the members on a regular basis, and goods should be purchased according to the plan to meet the needs of the members in a timely manner. (It is inevitable that the plan format is not up to standard, or that there are some discrepancies between the plan and the actual situation.) Regarding the reporting system, some areas have implemented the statistical reporting system stipulated by the National General Cooperative, and some areas have not yet implemented it. In this quarter, the conditions for evaluating and enjoying rationing can be temporarily based on the current reporting system in the area. 3. Require clear accounts and timely reporting and publication to members; but do not require new-style accounts to be made uniformly. 4. "Actively promoting the agricultural and sideline products of members and achieving results" should be one of the conditions for rural supply and marketing cooperatives to enjoy rationing benefits.

　　合作社第一季度试办配售成功
    证明配售制是促使合作社走上正轨的有力保证
    【新华社七日讯】全国合作总社今年第一季度有重点地在若干基层合作社试办配售已经成功，共计配售物资总值一百四十亿元，享受优待的社员七十万人。配售品的价格，在城市一般低于市场零售价百分之十左右，在农村低百分之十五左右，其中煤油的配售价更比市场零售价低百分之二十至四十，因此，配售制已受到广大社员的热烈欢迎，影响很大。第二季度申请配售优待的社员除东北区外，已达七百万人。
    这次试办配售的结果，证明了配售制是促使合作社走上正轨的有力保证。今年一月全国合作总社颁布了一九五一年第一季合作社配售暂行办法，规定了基层合作社必须具备以下四个条件才能享受配售优待：一、经营消费业务，根据社员需要进货；除滞销货物外，零售只卖社员，不卖非社员。二、账目清楚，按期结账，按期向社员公布。三、按期向县、市合作总社填送会计和统计报表，并有月度或节度零售计划。四、合作社理事和监事是社员选举的，不是上级委派的；理事会监事会和社员代表大会按期开会，并忠实履行这些会议的决议，确实为社员服务，在社员中享有威信。这个条例颁布后引起了一个群众性的整社运动。许多合作社的社员为了取得配售待遇，自动起来协助合作社走上正轨。同时，对于基层合作社大部地区根据上述四个条件展开了认真的评选工作，这就大大加强了合作社干部整顿合作社的决心。天津市被服二厂消费合作社在第一次评议时没有被选上。该社主任赵惠斌当场摘下胸前挂着的生产模范奖章，表示要在领导本社取得配售待遇后再戴上。开封市南关消费合作社办的不好，社员要求解散，但在听说实行配售制后，立即要求整社，不再要求解散了。
    第一季度试办配售工作中，也发生了一些缺点和困难。在评选方面，有些地区的合作社工作干部没有研究总社关于配售制度的指示，不进行评比工作，只是简单地依靠“上级决定”，这样就检查不出各基层合作社的工作的好坏，也就无从提出改进合作社的计划。另一些合作社在评比时机械地了解配售办法上所规定的条文，在枝节问题上互相挑剔，因而使有些较好的基层社没有得到配售优待。此外，在全国合作总社所规定的四个配售条件中，还缺少切合农村供销合作社情况的条件，在配售物品的数量方面，因城市职工和农民，以及职工与职工之间、农民与农民之间的购买力都不相同，目前规定配售物品的定量也不能全部适合社员的要求，如布的定量是七尺，社员使用就不方便。配售手续也还不够简便。
    为了改进第二季度的配售工作，全国合作总社已发出指示，取消统一的配售证，并把定量改为限量，使社员可在限量标准内任意购买。对于评选合作社享受配售优待的条件，指示也作了如下的解释：
    一、应全心全意为社员服务，满足社员需要，克服单纯的营利思想，取消与社员无关的市场交易，不要机械的提出“不作非社员交易”。二、业务经营方面应根据社员需要，按期做出供应计划，并按计划购货，及时满足社员需要。（计划形式不合规格，或计划与实际某些不符现象是难免的。）关于表报制度，有些地区已实行全国总社规定的统计表报制度，有些地区还未贯彻，本季度可暂按当地现行的表报制度，评比享受配售的条件。三、要求账目清楚，并能按时上报和向社员公布；但不要求一律做新式账。四、“积极推销社员农副产品，并有成绩者”应作为农村供销合作社享受配售优待的条件之一。
