Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 5th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session from April 25th to 27th. The meeting heard and discussed the report by Lecoeur, Secretary of the French Communist Party, on the tasks of the French Communist Party in the struggle for peace, and the report by Fajon on preparations for the general election. The meeting adopted a letter to the French people and other resolutions based on the spirit of the two reports. The meeting ended successfully after a closing speech by the Secretary of the French Communist Party, Duclos.

In his report, Lecoeur listed four main tasks of the French Communist Party in the struggle for peace: First, to strive to improve the living conditions of workers, and to explain the close relationship between the poverty of workers and the implementation of war policies; Second, to defend national industry and peaceful industry, and to organize mass movements against the manufacture, transportation, and storage of war materials; Third, to carry out the struggle against American occupation; Fourth, to vigorously carry out the struggle against the Vietnam War and the people's movement to free Henri Martin. Lecoeur emphasized that the movement against the remilitarization of West Germany must be expanded, and the work of explaining the declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact must be vigorously carried out.

The letter to the people passed by the Central Committee plenary session pointed out that the rulers of France, because of their pursuit of the aggressive policies of the United States, have committed all kinds of traitorous acts and taken all kinds of reactionary measures, thereby causing all social classes and strata in France, except for the two hundred monopoly capitalists, to feel infinite pain in their political, economic, and cultural lives. The letter to the people demands: abandon the war policy and adopt a policy of peace, national independence, and democracy; tear up all agreements that restrict French independence; stop the rearmament of West Germany; bring the expeditionary forces fighting in Korea and Vietnam back home; conclude a peace pact among the five major powers; reduce military spending by at least 400 billion francs, and abolish direct and indirect taxes that heavily burden the working masses, while taxing the excess profits of trusts. The letter to the people calls on all French people to unite around the Communist Party, smash the election conspiracy of the United States and its French lackeys, and guarantee the establishment of a government that is French rather than foreign, a government that defends peace rather than organizes war.

　　法共举行中央委员会全会
    列戈尔报告法共争取和平四项主要任务
    全会告人民书号召组织捍卫和平的政府
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会在四月二十五日至二十七日举行全会。会议听取并讨论了法共书记列戈尔关于法国共产党人在和平斗争中的任务的报告，以及法戎关于准备大选的报告。会议根据两个报告的精神通过了告法国人民书及其他决议。会议在法共书记杜克洛致闭幕辞后胜利结束。
    列戈尔在报告中列举了法国共产党人在争取和平的斗争中的四项主要任务：一、争取改善劳动者的生活条件，解释劳动者的贫穷状态与执行战争政策之间有着怎样的密切关系；二、保卫民族工业与和平工业，组织反对制造、运输与储存战争物资的群众运动；三、进行反对美国占领的斗争；四、大力进行反对越南战争的斗争与争取释放亨利·马丁的人民运动。列戈尔强调指出：必须扩大反对西德重新军国主义化的运动，并大力进行对缔结和平公约宣言的解释工作。
    中央全会通过的告人民书指出：法国的统治者因为追随美国的侵略政策，它作出了种种的卖国行径，并采取了种种的反动措施，从而使法国除二百家垄断资本家以外的一切社会阶级与阶层，都感受到政治、经济和文化生活上的无限痛苦。告人民书要求：抛弃战争政策，采取和平、民族独立与民主的政策；撕毁一切限制法国独立的协定；制止重新武装西德；把在朝鲜和越南作战的远征军调回国；缔结五大国和平公约；削减至少四千亿法郎的军费，取消使劳动大众负担沉重的直接税与间接税，而对托拉斯的超额利润课税。告人民书号召全体法国人民团结在共产党的周围，粉碎美国及其法国仆从的选举阴谋，保证建立一个不是外国的而是法国的政府，不是组织战争而是捍卫和平的政府。
