　　Anti-American and Aid-Korea Patriotic Education Must Be Integrated with Practical Work
    ——Experience in Anti-American and Aid-Korea Propaganda Work in Shanxi Province
    The Anti-American and Aid-Korea patriotic education in Shanxi Province has basically reached every household, and 50% of the villages are moving towards deeper understanding. The province launched a large-scale popularization and education campaign in April. At that time, all regions formulated plans and inspected the development of the movement. It was discovered that 20% to 30% of the regions or population were still weak areas or blank spots in Anti-American and Aid-Korea education. Therefore, the local Communist Party committees, in accordance with the principle of focusing on popularization, concentrated their efforts to attack weak areas, organized a large propaganda team, and carried out propaganda village by village, street by street, lane by lane, and household by household in a "contracted" manner, eliminating blank areas and greatly enhancing the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Seven million six hundred thousand people in the province participated in the signing of the petition to support the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers and the voting against the United States' arming of Japan. Six million people participated in the "May Day" parades and demonstrations. People from all walks of life signed patriotic pacts and launched large-scale patriotic production and work competitions. In Yushe County alone, 195 mutual aid teams challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid team, and 53 villages competed with each other. The phenomenon of thin political atmosphere in some rural areas has disappeared, and farmers are actively demanding to study politics and culture. In Li Cheng Maicang Village and Jincheng Chengguan District alone, more than 50 newspaper reading groups have been established.
    In this large-scale ideological education work, the province gained the following main experiences:
    First, it is necessary to clear the minds of cadres and make them understand that Anti-American and Aid-Korea is the important political task of the people of the whole country and the driving force for promoting all work. This is the primary and also a very arduous task. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has always implemented the method of going from top to bottom, from inside the Party to outside the Party, and first clearing the minds of cadres. At the same time, sharp criticism was carried out, and the importance of Anti-American and Aid-Korea was explained theoretically, so that everyone would understand its importance. On April 14, the Shanxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Whoever Slightly Neglects the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement Will Commit a Great Political Mistake," criticizing the phenomenon of Changzhi Prefecture and other places neglecting Anti-American and Aid-Korea education, which aroused the attention of the majority of cadres. On the other hand, it is necessary to educate cadres with the practical actions of the masses. The Provincial Party Committee sent a working group to Linfen County to assist the county in carrying out Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda and education work in Jindian Town. Combined with the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the situation was quickly opened up, enabling the leading cadres of the county to recognize the role of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement. The county then transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to promote Anti-American and Aid-Korea, and all work was vigorously promoted.
    Second, when conducting Anti-American and Aid-Korea patriotic education, the explanation and propaganda must be combined with the self-education of the masses. The so-called explanation and propaganda includes clarifying the reasons for Anti-American and Aid-Korea, resolving the difficult questions raised by the masses, criticizing certain erroneous understandings, and combating the deceptive propaganda of counter-revolutionaries; the so-called self-education of the masses is to use the specific political experiences of the masses to educate the masses, including recalling the past, comparing the present, and denouncing the crimes of the enemy. Local experiences have proved that wherever this is done, the broad masses can quickly raise their political awareness, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, understand the relationship between the country and the family, enhance their hatred for the enemy and their love for the motherland, and consciously devote themselves to various patriotic movements. For example, in Pingding County, a "denunciation, comparison, and root-finding movement" was widely launched in the propaganda and education work. Panjiayu Village in the Second District held a mass meeting to denounce the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Farmer Gao Minko told the masses about his personal experiences of three eras and three different social lives, which further deepened the hatred of the villagers for the old society and their love for the new society. They unanimously swore: "We must resist America and aid Korea, and step up production." More than 2,700 young people in the county requested to join the Volunteer Army. After education and denunciation, the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant put forward many vivid propaganda slogans, combining their work with the patriotic movement.
    Third, it is necessary to closely integrate Anti-American and Aid-Korea political education with the current practical work, use the political impetus of Anti-American and Aid-Korea to promote various work, and use the actual achievements of various work to enrich the strength of Anti-American and Aid-Korea. To solve this problem, we must first make cadres fully understand the relationship between Anti-American and Aid-Korea and other work. At the beginning of this movement in Linfen County, some cadres had a vague understanding of the relationship between Anti-American and Aid-Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the solution of leftover problems in land reform, and the rectification of rural grass-roots organizations. Therefore, the county first organized cadres to discuss. After the cadres realized the importance of Anti-American and Aid-Korea, the leading cadres raised a question: "Our people want to resist America and aid Korea. Are there any people who want to sabotage this movement? What should we do with these people?" After discussion, the cadres realized that to resist America and aid Korea, we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. Then, they asked: "Is it okay to just suppress counter-revolutionaries without uniting our own people? What is hindering our unity?" This made everyone realize the importance of universally mobilizing and uniting people from all walks of life. The current task is to solve the leftover problems in land reform, because this is closely related to uniting the middle peasants. Then, they raised another question: "Is it okay to do these things without leadership? Are the leaders of our villages sound? What should we do?" The cadres unanimously agreed that to resist America and aid Korea, we must lead the masses to do a good job in various tasks in the village, and first of all, we must rectify the grass-roots organizations. Finally, the conclusion was drawn: the important tasks of the county at present should be to continue to popularize and deepen the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement, strengthen patriotic ideological education, fully mobilize the masses to assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, solve the leftover problems of land reform, and rectify grass-roots organizations. In this way, the various tasks were naturally linked together. Facts have proved that wherever cadres pay attention to closely integrating Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda and education work with other work, the results are very good. For example, the counties in Linfen Prefecture launched the work of banning reactionary secret societies in conjunction with the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement. The broad masses of people recognized that the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, landlords, special agents, and reactionary secret societies were all in the same boat; the work of banning reactionary secret societies was smoothly carried out. As many as 80,000 Taoist followers have withdrawn.
    Fourth, in this propaganda and education work, various places have trained activists on a large scale, becoming an important force in the development and popularization of the movement. All parts of the province mobilized 500,000 activists by convening representative meetings of Anti-American and Aid-Korea, holding short-term training classes, etc., including representatives from all aspects, and through them, Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda and education work was widely carried out among the masses of all strata.

　　抗美援朝爱国教育必须结合实际工作
    ——山西省抗美援朝宣传工作经验
    山西省的抗美援朝爱国教育，已基本上做到家喻户晓，并有百分之五十的村庄转向深入。该省在四月份曾展开大规模的普及宣传教育工作。当时各地都制订了计划，检查了运动发展的情况，发现占百分之二十到三十的地区或人口，还是抗美援朝教育的薄弱区或空白点。因此各地中共党委均根据以普及为主的方针，集中力量突击薄弱地区，组织了广大的宣传队伍，以“包下来”的方式，逐村、逐街、逐巷、逐户进行宣传，消灭了空白地区，大大地提高了群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情。全省有七百六十万人参加了拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名与反对美国武装日本的投票，六百万人参加了“五一”游行示威。各界人民纷纷订立爱国公约，展开了大规模的爱国主义的生产、工作竞赛。仅榆社一县就有一百九十五个互助组向李顺达互助组应战，有五十三个村互相竞赛。有些农村政治空气稀薄的现象已不存在，农民积极要求学政治、学文化。仅黎城麦仓村和晋城城关区就建立了五十多个读报组。
    在这次大规模的思想教育工作中，该省获得如下几点主要经验：
    首先，要打通干部思想，使大家了解抗美援朝是全国人民当前重要的政治任务，是推动一切工作的动力。这是首要的，也是很艰巨的一件工作。中共山西省委始终贯彻了自上而下、由党内到党外、首先打通干部思想的方法。同时，尖锐地进行批评，从道理上说通，使大家知道抗美援朝的重要性。四月十四日山西日报以《谁要稍稍忽视抗美援朝运动，谁就要在政治上犯极大的错误》为题发表社论，批评了长治专区等地忽视抗美援朝教育的现象，引起了广大干部的注意。另一方面，要以群众的实际行动来教育干部。省委曾派工作组到临汾县，协助该县在金殿镇展开抗美援朝宣传教育工作，结合进行镇压反革命工作，很快就打开了局面，使该县领导干部认识了抗美援朝运动的作用。该县随即抽调了大批干部下乡宣传抗美援朝，一切工作也就轰轰烈烈地推动起来了。
    第二，在进行抗美援朝爱国教育时，讲解宣传必须与群众的自我教育相结合。所谓讲解宣传，包括讲清抗美援朝的道理，解决群众提出的疑难问题，批判某些错误认识，打击反革命的欺骗宣传等；所谓群众自我教育，就是用群众具体的政治经验来教育群众，包括回忆过去，对比现在，控诉敌人的罪行等。各地经验证明，凡是这样作了的，广大群众就能很快地提高政治觉悟，划清敌我界线，认识国和家的关系，增强对敌人的仇恨与对祖国的热爱，自觉地投身于各种爱国运动。如平定县在宣传教育工作中，普遍展开了“控诉、对比、找祸根运动”。二区潘家峪村举行了控诉日寇暴行的群众会，农民高民科又向群众讲述了亲身经历的三个时代、三种社会生活的不同，更加深了全村农民对旧社会的愤恨与对新社会的热爱。他们一致宣誓：“一定要抗美援朝，加紧生产。”该县有两千七百余青年要求参加志愿军。太原钢铁厂工人在经过教育与举行控诉之后，提出许多生动的宣传鼓动口号，把自己的工作和爱国运动结合起来。
    第三，必须把抗美援朝的政治教育和当前各项实际工作紧密结合，用抗美援朝的政治动力推动各种工作，用各种工作的实际成就来充实抗美援朝的力量。要解决这个问题，首先必须使干部充分认识抗美援朝与其他工作的关系。临汾县在这次运动开始时，有的干部对抗美援朝与镇压反革命、解决土地改革中的遗留问题、整顿农村基层组织等工作间的关系认识是模糊的。因此，该县首先就组织干部进行了讨论。当干部们认识了抗美援朝的重要性之后，领导干部就提出一个问题：“我们人民要抗美援朝，有没有人要破坏这个运动？对这些人怎么办？”经过讨论，使干部认识到要抗美援朝，就要坚决镇压反革命。接着又提出：“光镇压反革命，不团结自己人行不行？什么东西阻碍我们的团结呢？”这样就使大家认识到普遍发动与团结各阶层人民的重要性。当前一项工作就是要解决土地改革中的遗留问题，因为这与团结中农有很大关系。随后又提出一个问题：“要做好这些工作，没有领导行不行？我们各村的领导健全不健全？应该怎么办？”干部们一致认为要抗美援朝就要领导群众做好村中各项工作，首先就要整顿基层组织。最后得出结论：当前全县的重要工作任务，应该是继续普及深入抗美援朝运动，加强爱国主义思想教育，充分发动群众协助政府镇压反革命、解决土地改革遗留问题，整顿基层组织。这样，很自然地把各项工作联系起来了。事实证明，凡是干部注意把抗美援朝宣传教育工作与其他工作密切结合进行的地方，收到的效果都很好。如临汾专区各县结合抗美援朝运动展开了取缔反动会道门工作。广大群众认清了美、蒋、地主、特务和反动会道门都是一鼻孔出气的；取缔反动会道门工作便顺利地展开了。退道道徒已达八万人。
    第四，在这次宣传教育工作中，各地大规模地训练积极分子，成为运动开展、普及到深入的重要力量。全省各地以召开抗美援朝代表会、举办短期训练班等方式，动员了五十万名积极分子，包括了各方面的代表人物，通过他们在各阶层群众中广泛地展开了抗美援朝宣传教育工作。
