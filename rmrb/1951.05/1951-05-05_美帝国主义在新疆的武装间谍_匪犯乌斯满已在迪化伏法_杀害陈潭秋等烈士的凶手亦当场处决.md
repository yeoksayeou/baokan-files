Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd: Dihua dispatch: Usman, the bandit leader and armed spy of American imperialism, and Li Yingqi, Fu Baolian, Zhang Guangqian, Liu Hansheng, and others, the murderers who killed Chen Tanqiu, a member of the CPC Central Committee, CPC members Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu, Qiao Guozhen, and others, were executed in Dihua on April 29th after being tried by the people's court and undergoing a public trial.

On the day of the execution of the bandits Usman, Li, and others, more than 80,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xinjiang Province (two-thirds of the total population of Dihua) held a public trial and sentencing rally for the counter-revolutionary bandits Usman, Li, and others. The presiding judge was Burhan, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government. All representatives of the Provincial People's Congress attended. In addition, more than 10,000 people listened to the live broadcast of the conference outside the venue. When Usman, Li Yingqi, and other bandit leaders were escorted into the venue, people of all ethnic groups immediately raised their arms and shouted in their respective languages, "Execute the heinous counter-revolutionaries!"

At the public trial, people of all ethnic groups who had been victimized took the stage to make accusations. Tursun, a representative from Mulei River County, accused Usman of his crimes, saying, "Under the instructions of American imperialism, Usman killed 366 people of all ethnic groups in Mulei River alone, and burned 2,480 houses." Azirhan, a Kazakh woman from Jinghua County, holding her four-month-old child, tearfully recounted Usman's crimes. Usman's bandits robbed her of all her livestock and property, and even brutally murdered her sister, who was giving birth, by ripping open her chest and stomach. She asked the People's Government to avenge her. Tishkenbai, a Kazakh representative from the Ashan area, after accusing Usman of the countless blood debts he owed in Ashan, loudly demanded that the People's Government shoot him. Women Wang Xifen, Huang Shuwei, Jiang Yune, and others, when accusing the "Living Yama" Li Yingqi, Fu Baolian, and others of their crimes, tearfully recounted the circumstances of the deaths of their husbands and sons. Wang Xifen's husband was skinned by executioners like Li Yingqi and others, and his body was cut into eight pieces. Seventy-year-old Old Lady Yang broke down crying on stage when she accused Li Yingqi and others of murdering her son. Many people in the audience also began to cry. The slogan "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!" shook the entire venue. Liu Huping, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, accused, "The bandit Sheng Shicai threw 132 CPC members who were engaged in the anti-Japanese national salvation work in Xinjiang into prison. Executioners such as Li Yingqi, Fu Baolian, and Zhang Guangqian used various cruel tortures to kill Chen Tanqiu, a member of the CPC Central Committee, and outstanding Communist Party members Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu, Qiao Guozhen, and others. Li Yingqi and Fu Baolian were Sheng Shicai's biggest accomplices. We demand that the People's Government severely punish this group of counter-revolutionaries and avenge the dead martyrs!"

When the presiding judge Burhan announced the death sentence for this group of counter-revolutionary bandit leaders, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause and cheered enthusiastically. The families who had been harmed by the bandit leaders Usman, Li, and others closely followed the prison vehicles to the execution ground. They witnessed the bandits' fate with their own eyes. Disregarding the police officers' attempts to stop them, they threw stones at the bandits' corpses to vent their hatred. More than 10,000 people of all ethnic groups watched at the execution ground.

Note: The bandit leader Usman was an armed spy of American imperialism in Xinjiang. Usman's crimes in Xinjiang for more than ten years have caused inestimable losses to the lives and property of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. According to incomplete statistics, Usman robbed people of all ethnic groups more than 230 times, massacred 319 Kazakh households, killed 1,175 people of all ethnic groups, and plundered more than 340,000 head of cattle, horses, sheep, and other livestock, and more than 5,300 dan of grain. In 1947, Usman, under the instructions of American imperialist spies and Marknan, the former US Deputy Consul in Dihua, cooperated with the Xinjiang Garrison Commander of the Kuomintang reactionary government, Song Xilian, to invade the Mongolian People's Republic, creating the so-called "Beitashan Incident." In 1948, Usman, under the instruction of Marknan and Song Xilian, formed the "Anti-Communist, Anti-Soviet, Anti-Three Districts (referring to Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan) Revolutionary Committee," with Usman as the vice chairman. After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang in September 1949, Usman spread rumors and coerced the Kazakh people to rebel. In March 1950, Usman joined forces with bandits such as Janim Khan and Yaolebos, engaging in arson, killings, and looting everywhere, causing great suffering to the people of all ethnic groups in northern Xinjiang. The People's Liberation Army's bandit suppression troops heroically encircled and suppressed them, successively eliminating all the bandits, and on the morning of February 19th of this year, in the Haizi area of the Qilian Mountains bordering Gansu and Qinghai, Usman was captured alive.

The bandit leaders Li Yingqi, Fu Baolian, Zhang Guangqian, and Liu Hansheng were all the chief accomplices of the bandit Sheng Shicai during his rule in Xinjiang. In 1937, they fabricated the so-called "First Great Conspiracy Riot Case," in which nearly a thousand people of all ethnic groups were arrested and killed; in 1940, they fabricated the so-called "Du Chongyuan Conspiracy Riot Case," persecuting more than 400 people; in 1942, they fabricated the so-called "April 12th Conspiracy Riot Case," slandering the Chinese Communist Party members who were engaged in anti-Japanese national salvation work in Xinjiang at the time, arresting and killing Chen Tanqiu, a member of the CPC Central Committee, and party members Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu, and others, and persecuting more than 300 people. They personally executed more than 860 people. Li Yingqi served as the Director of the Sheng Bandit's Public Security Administration and Deputy Chairman of the Secret Trial Committee; Fu Baolian served as the Deputy Director of the Sheng Bandit's Public Security Administration; Zhang Guangqian served as the Section Chief of the Sheng Bandit's Public Security Administration and a member of the Secret Trial Committee; Liu Hansheng served as the Chairman of the Sheng Bandit's Secret Trial Committee.

　　美帝国主义在新疆的武装间谍
    匪犯乌斯满已在迪化伏法
    杀害陈潭秋等烈士的凶手亦当场处决
    【新华社西安三日电】迪化讯：美帝国主义武装间谍乌斯满匪首和杀害中共中央委员陈潭秋、中共党员毛泽民、林基路、乔国桢等的凶手李英奇、富宝廉、张光前、刘汉升等，经人民法庭审讯并举行公审后已于四月二十九日在迪化伏法。
    在乌、李等匪伏法的当天，新疆省各民族各界人民八万余人（占迪化市总人口三分之二）举行了公审乌、李等反革命匪犯大会。主审人为省人民政府主席鲍尔汉。省人民代表会全体代表均出席参加。此外，还有一万多人在会外收听大会实况广播。当乌斯满、李英奇等匪首押入会场时，各民族人民立即用本民族语言振臂高呼“枪决罪大恶极的反革命分子！”
    公审会上，被害的各民族人民纷纷上台进行控诉。木垒河县代表吐尔逊控诉乌斯满的罪行说：“乌斯满在美帝国主义指示下，仅在木垒河一地即杀害各民族人民三百六十六人，烧毁民房二千四百八十间。”景化县哈萨克族妇女阿孜尔汉抱着四个月的孩子，哭诉乌斯满的罪行。乌斯满匪徒抢走了她的全部牲畜财产，还把她正在生小孩的姊姊破胸开膛地杀死了。她要求人民政府为她报仇。阿山专区代表、哈萨克族人提士肯巴依控诉乌匪在阿山欠下的无数血债后，高声要求人民政府枪毙他，妇女王西芬、黄树为、姜云娥等控诉“活阎王”李英奇、富宝廉等罪恶时，一字一泪地诉说她们丈夫和儿子的被害经过。王西芬的丈夫被李英奇等刽子手剥了皮，并将身体割成八块。七十岁的杨老太太控诉李英奇等杀害他儿子的罪行时，哭不成声，昏倒台上。台下许多群众也哭了起来。“坚决镇压反革命！”的口号声震动整个会场。中国共产党党员刘护平控诉说：“盛世才匪徒把在新疆从事抗日救国工作的一百三十二名中共党员投入监牢，李英奇、富宝廉、张光前等刽子手，用种种酷刑拷打，杀害了中共中央委员陈潭秋及优秀的共产党员毛泽民、林基路、乔国桢等人。李英奇、富宝廉是盛世才的最大帮凶，要求人民政府严惩这批反革命分子，为死难烈士复仇！”
    当主审人鲍尔汉宣判这批反革命匪首死刑时，全场掌声雷动，热烈欢呼。被乌、李等匪首残害的家属们，他们紧随刑车，赶赴刑场。他们亲眼看到了匪徒的下场。他们不顾公安人员的阻止，纷纷向匪首尸体投掷石头泄恨。在刑场围观的各民族人民达一万余人。
    按：乌斯满匪首是美帝国主义在新疆的武装间谍。乌匪在新疆十余年的罪行，使新疆各民族人民的生命财产遭受了无可估计的损失。据不完全统计：乌匪先后抢劫各族人民二百三十余次，屠杀哈萨克族同胞三百一十九户，杀害各民族人民一千一百七十五人，抢去牛、马、羊等牲畜三十四万多头，粮食五千三百石以上。一九四七年，乌匪接受美帝国主义间谍、美国前驻迪化副领事马克南指使，配合国民党反动政府新疆警备总司令宋匪希濂侵犯蒙古人民共和国，制造所谓“北塔山事件”。一九四八年，乌匪又在马克南和宋希濂指使下，组成“反共反苏反三区（按指伊犁、塔城、阿山）革命委员会”，乌匪任副委员长。一九四九年九月新疆和平解放后，乌匪大肆造谣，并胁迫哈萨克人民叛乱。一九五零年三月，乌匪与贾尼木汗、尧乐博斯等匪会合一处，到处烧杀抢劫，北疆各民族人民受害极深。人民解放军剿匪部队英勇围剿，先后消灭了所有股匪，并于本年二月十九日晨，在甘肃、青海交界的祁连山海子地区，将乌匪生擒。
    李英奇、富宝廉、张光前、刘汉升等匪首，都是盛匪世才统治新疆时的首恶帮凶。他们在一九三七年制造了所谓“第一次大阴谋暴动案”，被捕被杀的各民族人民近千人；一九四零年制造所谓“杜重远阴谋暴动案”，残害四百余人；一九四二年又制造所谓“四一二阴谋暴动案”，污蔑当时在新疆进行抗日救国工作的中国共产党员，逮捕并杀害了中共中央委员陈潭秋及党员毛泽民、林基路等，残害三百余人。被他们亲手处死者即达八百六十余人。李英奇曾任盛匪公安管理处处长，秘密审判委员会副委员长；富宝廉曾任盛匪公安管理处副处长；张光前曾任盛匪公安管理处副科长及秘密审判委员会委员；刘汉升曾任盛匪秘密审判委员会委员长。
