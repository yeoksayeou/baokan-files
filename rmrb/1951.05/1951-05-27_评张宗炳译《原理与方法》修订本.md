　　Review of the Revised Edition of Zhang Zongbing's Translation of "Principles and Methods"
　　Fang Ziliang
　　Zhang Zongbing's translation of "Principles and Methods" (Mičurin's 50 Years of Work Summary), since "Book Review" No. 8 (July 12, 1950) published Ye Duzhuang's criticism, the translator also made a review and statement. Last September, some errors and inappropriate translations in the book were corrected, and the revised edition of the book was published in January of this year.

　　In the "Translator's Note" of the revised edition, a section was added to explain the process of accepting criticisms and making corrections: "Several errors and inappropriate translations have been corrected in this edition, but the general translation has not been changed." The translator demonstrated a willingness to accept criticism and quickly completed the corrections, which is a good thing. However, the translator did not take the opportunity of the revised reprint to thoroughly check the entire translation, correct other errors in the book, and even did not completely and thoroughly correct the errors pointed out by the criticism. This is very regrettable for this revised translation of Mičurin's famous work.

　　First of all, it should be pointed out that the translator did not thoroughly correct the errors pointed out in the criticism. For example, the translator wrongly translated "Genus" as "Variety." In the reprinted edition, except for correcting "Intervarietal hybridization" in the title of Chapter 5 to "Intergeneric hybridization," the translation of "Genus" as "Variety" in the text was not corrected. Another example is the title of Chapter 2. In the first edition, it was: "The Error of the View that Transplanting Southern Fruit Trees to the North Can Change Them." The criticism pointed out that the original title should be translated as: "The Mistaken Idea that Simply Transplanting Southern Plants Can Acclimatize Them." The reason is that the word "simply" cannot be omitted, and it is not acceptable to translate "acclimatized" (already adapted to the climate of a new area) as "change." In the revised edition, the translator changed the title to: "The Error of the Idea that Simply Transplanting Southern Fruit Trees Can Change Them," which makes the meaning even more unclear.

　　There are many other shortcomings and errors in the translation, such as omissions and mistranslations pointed out by Mr. Ye, which can be found in almost every chapter. The existence of these errors makes it difficult for readers to understand the translation or obtain correct knowledge. Taking the translation of Chapter 5 as an example, here are some of the more important errors. (The reason for using this chapter as an example is not because there are particularly many errors in this chapter, but because this chapter is relatively short, including only twelve short paragraphs, and Mr. Ye has already criticized the shortcomings in the first four chapters to some extent.)

　　In the first paragraph, "Intergeneric" is translated as "Intervarietal," and "sterile" is translated as "cannot flower." In fact, the meaning of "sterile" is much broader than "cannot flower."

　　In the second paragraph, "The success of this work (referring to 'distant hybridization') is slower than that of crosses between the same species." Zhang translates as: "The results of this work are slower than those of crosses between the same species." This is not very clear in meaning.

　　In the fourth paragraph, "Young hybrids flowering for the first time" Zhang translates as: "Hybrid seedlings flowering for the first time." Note: Seedlings refer to immature young plants that have not yet matured. Those that are flowering are generally no longer called seedlings.

　　In the fifth paragraph, "These types of crosses," Zhang translates as: "Interspecific hybridization." Note: The original meaning of these types of crosses refers to "distant hybridization," which includes "interspecific," "intergeneric," and even "interfamilial" hybridization. Also, "For example… grafting apricot or peach onto plum trees, etc. Only a few grafts, especially of stone fruits, can grow together with the rootstock." Zhang translates as: "For example… or apricots grafted on peach trees, plum trees, in stone fruits, often only a few grafts can truly grow together with the rootstock." This reverses the meaning of the original text. Also, "...in structure, gradually begin to partially change, until the time of flowering." Zhang translates as: "...its structure and characteristics will change by the time of flowering," which is different from the meaning of the original text.

　　In the sixth paragraph, "Hybrids produced by different species are not all sterile." Zhang translates as: "The result of interspecific hybridization is not necessarily that no offspring are produced." This can be interpreted as interspecific hybridization often does not produce offspring. However, the original text refers to hybrids (i.e., the offspring produced by interspecific hybridization), not the parents of the hybrids.

　　In the seventh paragraph, "Among these seedlings, there are many seedlings whose structures are quite different." Zhang translates as: "Among these seedlings grown from buds, there are many differences in morphology." Note: It is not all seedlings that have quite different structures!

　　In the eighth paragraph, "Vegetative hybrids of apple and pear," Zhang translates as: "Interspecific hybridization of apple and pear." The word "interspecific" was added by Mr. Zhang. In fact, apples and pears are not only different species, but can even be regarded as different genera.

　　There are really too many shortcomings and errors similar to those listed above. Some errors are even more serious than the ones mentioned above. For example, a few sentences in the second paragraph on page 20, the general meaning of the original text is: "The seeds obtained from these very large fruits or peels are mostly underdeveloped and weak, and often can only grow fruit trees that bear small fruits." Zhang translates as: "The seeds of such very large fruits are also abnormal, because its peel is always underdeveloped, and weak, and the fruit trees they produce in the next generation, on the contrary, only have small fruits." This is a bit close to random translation. The original text did not say that the seeds were abnormal, but that the fruit or peel was very large; and it was the seeds that were underdeveloped and weak, not the peel!

　　Finally, let me cite two very simple paragraphs from the preface to the third edition of the original work as a representative of this translation to see how careless and unfaithful this translation is. These are the third and fourth paragraphs. The general meaning is this:

　　"The changes that have taken place in our country in these years after the revolution are of special significance.

　　"The socialist system has brought new historical tasks to the working people of our country, according to their needs in life and knowledge."

　　Zhang translates as:

　　"Especially in our country in recent years, the changes during the revolutionary period are very meaningful.

　　"The socialist system enables the workers in our country to face new tasks in history, which are completely in line with their abilities and needs."

　　The "special significance" in the original text was separated by Mr. Zhang, "working people" was translated as "workers," "after the revolution" was translated as "during the revolutionary period," and "needs in life and knowledge" was translated as "abilities and needs." The tone of the original text was not taken care of by the translator at all.

　　It is very bad that such an important book has so many shortcomings and errors. It is unfair to the original author and readers that the translator did not carefully correct it during the reprinting opportunity.

　　评张宗炳译《原理与方法》修订本
    方子亮
    张宗炳译《原理与方法》（米邱林五十年工作总结），自经“图书评论”第八号（一九五○年七月十二日）发表了叶笃庄的批评后，译者也作了检讨与声明，去年九月间便将书中某些错误与不妥作了改正，本年一月出版了该书的修订本。
    修订本的“译者之言”中加了一节，说明接受批评和改正的经过：“错误及译名不妥数处，在本版中已加改正，但是大体的译文没有更改。”译者表现了接受批评的风度，而且很快地完成了改正，这是很好的一面。但译者没有趁修订再版时深入检查全部译文，改正书中另一些错误，而且就是批评所指出的错误也没有全部彻底改正，对于这一本修订的米邱林的名著的译本来说，是十分遗憾的。
    首先应该指出的是：批评中所指出的错误，译者也没有彻底加以订正。例如：译者把“属”（Genus）错译成“族”（Variety），再版的译本，除了只把第五章的题目中的“族间杂交”改正为“属间杂交”外，本文里把“属”译成“族”的，依旧没有订正。又如第二章的题目，在第一版是：“南方果树移植北方可以改变之观点的错误”，批评指出这题目的原文应译成：“简单移植南方植物可以使它们驯化的错误观念”。理由是“简单”两字是不能漏去不译的，而把acclimatized（已能适应新地区的气候）译成“改变”是不可以的。在修订本中，译者把这题目改成：“南方果树移植简单可以改变之观念的错误”，这是愈改意义愈不明了。
    译文里还有许多别的缺点和错误，如叶先生所指出的漏译和误译，几乎每章都有。这种错误的存在，使读者读不懂译文，或者得不到正确的知识。如以第五章的译文为例，举出其中较重要的错误。（以这一章为例的理由，并不是因为这一章的错误特别多，而是这一章比较短，只包括短短的十二段，而且前四章里的缺点，已多少给叶先生批评过了。）
    第一段里，把“属间”译成“族间”，“不育”译成“不能开花”。实际上“不育”的含义比“不能开花”广泛多了。
    第二段里，“这一工作（指‘远缘杂交’）的成功比同种间的交配来得慢些。”张译作：“这一工作较之同种间之交配结果来的慢。”这是意义不很明晰的。
    第四段里，“初次开花的年轻杂种”张译作：“初次开花的杂种苗木”。按：苗木是指还没有成熟的幼植物，英文是Seedling。开花的，一般不再叫做苗木了。
    第五段里，“这类杂交”，张译作：“种间杂交”。按：这类杂交原意是指“远缘杂交”而言的，包括“种间”、“属间”甚至“科间”的杂交在内。又，“例如……杏或桃嫁接在李树上等。只有少数的接枝，特别是核果树的，能和砧木长合在一起。”张译作：“例如……或是杏子接在桃树，李树上，在核果内，往往只有几个接枝真能与砧木长合在一起。”这就把原文含义颠倒了。又，“……在构造上，逐渐开始部分的改变，一直到开花时候。”张译作：“……它的构造与品性到开花时候便有所改变”，是和原文含义不同的。
    第六段里，“异种所生杂种并不都是不育的。”张译作：“种间杂交的结果不一定都是不传后代的。”这可以解释为种间的杂交，多不产出后代。可是原文是指杂种（即种间杂交所生的后代）并不是指杂种的亲代。
    第七段里，“在这些苗木中，有不少苗木的构造，颇有差别。”张译作：“在这些出芽长成的苗木中，形态有许多差别。”按：构造颇有差别的并不是所有的苗木！
    第八段里，“苹果和梨的营养体杂种”，张译作：“苹果和梨的种间杂交”。“种间”是张先生加上的。实际上，苹果和梨不仅是不同种，而且甚至可视为是不同属的。
    类似以上所举的缺点和错误，实在是太多了。有的错误，且比上述的更严重。例如，第二十页第二段的几句原文大意是：“从这非常大的果实或果皮里所得到的种子，多数发育不完全和瘦弱，常常仅能长出只结小果实的果树。”张译作：“这样非常大的果实的种子也是不正常的，因为它的果皮总是发育不全，而瘦弱，它们所产生下一代的果树，反而只有小的果实。”这就有点近于乱译了。原文并没有说种子不正常，而是说果实或果皮是非常的大；而发育不全和瘦弱的是种子，并不是果皮！
    最后，让我举出原著三版序文中很简单的两段话，来作为这译本的代表，来看看这译笔是如何不够细心，不够忠实。这是第三和第四段。大意是这样：
    “在革命以后的这些年头，我们国内所发生的改变是有特别意义的。
    “社会主义制度给我们国内的劳动人民，依照他们生活上和智识上的需要，带来了新的历史任务。”
    张译作：
    “特别是我们国内这几年，在革命期中的改变是十分的有意义。
    “社会主义的制度使我们国内的工作者面对着历史上新的任务，这任务是与他们的能力与需要完全相符的。”
    原文里的“特别意义”给张先生分开了，“劳动人民”被译为“工作者”，“革命以后”被译为“革命期中”，“生活上和智识上的需要”，被译为“能力与需要”。原文的语气，译者根本没有照顾到。
    象这样重要的书，有这样多的缺点和错误，是很不好的。译者没有趁再版机会，仔细订正一下，是对不住原著者和读者的。
