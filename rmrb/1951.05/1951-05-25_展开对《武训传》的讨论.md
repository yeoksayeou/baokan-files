　　Unfold the Discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Shanghai Dagong Bao

    Since the release of the film "The Life of Wu Xun", newspapers and magazines in various regions have published numerous articles. The vast majority of these articles praised "The Life of Wu Xun". Especially after the film was completed and first screened in Shanghai, all articles about "The Life of Wu Xun" that appeared in Shanghai newspapers and magazines were praises (including the articles published in this newspaper). It wasn't until "The Life of Wu Xun" was shown in Beijing, sparking discussions in newspapers and in person, and the "Literary Gazette" subsequently published two issues with very stern criticisms, and the People's Daily reprinted these articles and published an editorial, that the issue became clear. Many people suddenly realized that they had unknowingly been poisoned by the toxins of "The Life of Wu Xun".

    This issue requires extensive discussion, especially in the education and literary circles, where thorough research should be conducted. Not only should the film "The Life of Wu Xun" be dissected, but all relevant books and papers about Wu Xun should also be systematically discussed, completely negating Wu Xun as a person, thoroughly overturning Wu Xunism, and eradicating the so-called Wu Xun spirit from its roots. Only in this way can the ideological confusion in the cultural circles, as demonstrated by "The Life of Wu Xun," be clarified.

    What is discussed here is only about the film "The Life of Wu Xun" itself.

    What is Wu Xunism? It is capitulationism, kowtowing, the negation of class struggle, obsequious service to the ruling class, and the feeling that the reason why poor people are bullied is because they haven't studied. Therefore, it encourages the poor to study the classics, climb upwards, and become accomplices of the ruling class.

    Firstly, the Wu Xun portrayed in "The Life of Wu Xun" (who is also the original Wu Xun) kneels down when he sees Zhang, the successful candidate in the imperial examinations; he doesn't utter a sound when he is beaten; it is "one punch, two coins; one kick, three coins"; it is "Killing? Is it okay?" (Here, we will not discuss the film's distortion of the peasant revolution as killing.) Thus, Wu Xun is a person without any will to fight, kowtowing and suffering humiliation everywhere. He doesn't think of resisting this oppression at all, but simply accepts it submissively. This, then, is the so-called Wu Xun spirit. Is this the spirit of the Chinese people? Is this the spirit of resistance and struggle of the Chinese people (peasants) for thousands of years? Especially, the era in which Wu Xun lived was the era of the great struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution was happening at this time. Wu Xun did not think about the thousands of years of feudal rule, did not think about the root of oppression, did not think about overthrowing the feudal rule, and even less thought about the oppression of imperialism. The path he took was contrary to the struggle path of the vast majority of the people at the time. He kowtowed, he surrendered, and as a result, he maintained feudal rule.

    Secondly, Wu Xun (and the vast majority of peasants at the time) suffered all kinds of oppression. Why did they suffer oppression? Wu Xun believed it was because they were illiterate. Therefore, he begged for alms to establish schools. "No money, no backing, and no formal education," yet he "did this for thirty years as if it were a single day," and finally established free schools. Here, a fundamental error lies in the fact that the reason why peasants were oppressed was not because they were illiterate, but because the landlord class ruled and exploited them politically and economically (the biggest landlord was the Manchu emperor), making it impossible for them to turn over, and because they were oppressed by imperialism. Therefore, to solve the problem (to avoid oppression), one must struggle against the feudal ruling class and imperialism, just like the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution at the time, rather than focusing on the issue of literacy. In fact, what the vast majority of peasants cared about at the time were livelihood issues, not the desire to be literate. The peasants in the film who were unwilling to send their children to Wu Xun's free schools illustrate this point.

    To further discuss, Wu Xun begged for alms to establish schools with the aim of preventing peasants from being bullied and ensuring that everyone had the opportunity to read. What kind of books did they read? They read the classics, defending the teachings of the sages. That was exactly what Wu Xun heard when he was working as a farmhand at Zhang's house, when the teacher was teaching Zhang's son: "Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others." Therefore, "He who excels in learning can become an official." Poor children, after studying, could become officials and become helpers and accomplices of the ruling class, eventually becoming the ruling class that rides on the backs of the people. In this way, the result of Wu Xun's begging for alms to establish schools was to maintain feudal rule; the so-called Wu Xun spirit was to be a slave.

    Today, when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have achieved great victory after more than thirty years of arduous struggle, the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is going backwards, praising the people for surrendering to the feudal rule, kowtowing, and maintaining the feudal rule. This violates historical materialism, and it is a slander of the struggle of the Chinese peasants. The writers and directors seemed to attempt to criticize Wu Xun to some extent, but the result is that what the audience sees is so weak as to be almost nonexistent; on the contrary, it is thorough Wu Xun worship, Wu Xun praise. At a time when the Chinese people's film industry is moving forward, this film has caused such a serious error, which cannot be ignored.

    The majority of articles praising "The Life of Wu Xun" precisely reflect the ideological confusion and the low level of the cultural circles. Further discussion should be unfolded on "The Life of Wu Xun." We look forward to systematically conducting Wu Xun research and clarifying incorrect ideas. Through this event, filmmakers, cultural circles, education circles, and the broad masses of the people will receive great education, thereby improving our ideological level and further advancing the people's film industry.

    This newspaper has published several articles related to "The Life of Wu Xun." A part of them are confessions of the filmmakers of this film, and generally speaking, they are all blind praises of "The Life of Wu Xun." This shows that our ideological level is not high enough and we should examine and improve it. Through this event, we feel that we have received education first and foremost.

### 展开对《武训传》的讨论

　　展开对《武训传》的讨论
    上海大公报
    电影《武训传》上映后，各地报章杂志发表了不少文章，这些文章的绝大部分是赞扬《武训传》的，尤其片子摄制完成，在上海首先映出时，出现在上海报纸杂志上的有关《武训传》文章，全部是赞扬（这里面也包括在本报发表的文章）。直到《武训传》在北京映出，引起报纸和口头的讨论，文艺报接着两期发表了很严厉的批评，人民日报转载了这些文章，又发表了社论，这才使问题明确了，很多人恍然大悟，原来不知不觉中了《武训传》的毒素。
    这一问题还需要广泛讨论，尤其是教育界和文艺界应该很好的进行研究，不但要把《武训传》这部影片剖解清楚，还应该有系统地讨论一切有关武训的著作和论文，把武训这个人彻底否定，把武训主义完全推翻，把所谓武训精神连根拔除。这样，才能澄清因《武训传》而表现出的文化界的思想混乱情况。
    这里所谈的，只是就《武训传》影片本身而言。
    武训主义是什么？是投降主义，是磕头主义，是否定阶级斗争，是奴颜婢膝为统治阶级服务，是感觉到穷人受欺负的原因在没有读书，因而要穷人读圣贤书，能够往上爬，为统治阶级作帮凶。
    首先，《武训传》，所刻画出来的武训（也是本来的武训），是见了张举人就下跪，是挨了打不哼一声，是“打一拳，两个钱；踢一脚，三个钱”；是“杀人？行吗？”（这里姑不论影片歪曲了农民革命就是杀人一点）于是，武训就是一个毫无斗争意志，四处磕头受气的人，他丝毫没有想到去反抗这种压迫，而只是逆来顺受。这样，这就是所谓武训精神了。这是中国人民的精神吗？这是几千年来中国人民（农民）反抗斗争的精神吗？尤其，武训所处的时代，正是中国人民反帝反封建的伟大斗争时代，太平天国革命，正在此时。武训没有想到几千年来的封建统治，没有想到受压迫的根源，没有想到去推翻封建统治，更没有想到帝国主义的压迫。他所走的道路，是和当时广大人民的斗争道路相反的，他磕头，他投降，结果是维护了封建统治。
    其次，武训（和当时广大的农民）受尽压迫，为什么会遭受压迫呢？武训认为是不识字的关系，于是，他就行乞兴学了。“一无钱，二无靠山，三无学校教育”，而他“三十年如一日”，终于，办成了义学。这里，一个根本的错误，就是农民受压迫并不是因为不识字，而是因为农民在政治上经济上受地主阶级统治剥削（最大的地主便是满清皇帝），不能翻身，和受帝国主义压迫。因此，要解决问题（不受压迫），便是向封建统治阶级和帝国主义进行斗争，正如当时的太平天国革命一样，而不是识字的问题。而事实上，当时广大农民所关心的，是生活上的问题，而不是要求识字，影片中的农民，不愿小孩去上武训的义学，正是这个道理。
    再进一步讨论，武训行乞兴学，目的是在使农民不受欺负，都有书读，读什么书呢？读圣贤书，卫经传道。那正是武训到张举人家做长工时，听见老师教张举人儿子的“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人。”于是，“学而优则仕”。穷孩子读了书，便可以做官了，便成为统治阶级的帮闲帮凶，以至于不折不扣成为骑在人民头上的统治阶级。这样一来，武训行乞兴学的结果，便是维护封建统治；所谓武训精神，便是作奴才。
    当中国人民在共产党领导下，进行了三十几年的艰苦斗争，取得了伟大胜利的今天，影片《武训传》却大开倒车，颂扬人民向封建统治投降磕头，维护封建统治，这是违背历史唯物论的，这是对于中国农民斗争的诬蔑。编导者似乎也企图对武训有所批判，结果，观众所看见的，却是微弱得几近于无；相反的，倒是彻头彻尾的武训崇拜，武训颂扬。在中国人民电影事业正向前发展的时候，这张影片却造成这样的严重错误，是不可忽视的。
    大多数文章颂扬《武训传》，正表现了文化界思想的混乱，水平还很差。对于《武训传》，应该展开进一步的讨论，我们期待有系统地进行武训研究，澄清不正确的思想。通过这一事件，将使电影工作者、文化界、教育界和广大人民获得很大的教育，从而提高我们的思想水平，更使人民的电影事业向前迈进。
    本报曾经发表过几篇有关《武训传》的文章，一部分是这部影片工作者的自白，整个说来，都是对《武训传》的盲目颂扬。这说明了我们的思想水平还不够高，应该检讨提高。通过这一事件，我们首先感到获得了教育。
