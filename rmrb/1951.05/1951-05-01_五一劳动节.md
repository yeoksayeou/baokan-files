　　May Day

　　Soviet Writer Mikhailov

　　May Day is a holiday for all workers, for all laborers. Labor is the foundation of human life, and May Day is the international workers' holiday, a day when people respect labor.

　　However, for workers in capitalist countries, it is still a holiday to aspire to. Because there, labor has not yet been liberated, and labor is still being exploited by capitalists. On May Day, the confidence of the laborers in their own liberation burns even more powerfully.

　　But in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, this is already a holiday of victory. Here, people are free, and their labor has been liberated. Here, people have great achievements, and they feel that their working lives are true happiness.

　　In the Soviet Union, no worker sells their labor to capitalists for a piece of bread. Here, people labor for themselves, for their motherland, and for the people. In the Soviet land, labor has no other purpose than to continuously improve the living standards of the laborers, increase the wealth of the nation, and strengthen the power of the motherland. The Soviet people are working vigorously, their country is becoming richer day by day, and its citizens are living better and better.

　　The Soviet people are fully enjoying the happiness of peaceful life, and while they are building a communist and even better future in their own country, they naturally hate war. To the threats of the imperialists, to the threats of these warmongers, their answer is: to work attentively and continuously, and to contribute all their strength to peaceful construction. Evidence of the Soviet people's desire for peace can be seen everywhere in the Soviet Union.

　　On May Day, the streets of Moscow are filled with joyful people. Springtime Moscow is beautiful. And what is most beautiful about it is the manifest face of lasting peace and confidence in the future, which can be seen everywhere.

　　A skyscraper like a carved cliff can be seen in the distance above the rooftops of the city. This is one of the several tall buildings built in Moscow on Stalin's proposal. Within your sight in the streets of Moscow, you can see the new university buildings on Lenin Hills, the new thirty-two-story building near the mouth of the Yauza River, and the building towering over Smolensk Square. Everyone knows that the purpose of these buildings is for peace. This is a great building of the coming communism.

　　In every corner of the vast Soviet land, you will have this feeling. Throughout the land from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, cities and villages are prospering like blooming flowers. The new sports field in Leningrad, the cultural palaces in the worker centers of the Urals and Siberia, the new sanatoriums built for workers in the Caucasus Mountains, the new villages in Ukraine, the Moscow suburbs, and the Volga River basin – these are the precursors of collective farm cities, which have been planned and have begun to be built...

　　In the days of the recent war, the Hitler bandits flooded the mines of Ukraine with water, thinking: let it be flooded for ten years. They destroyed the factories along the Baltic coast, thinking: they can't be rebuilt. They cut down the vineyards of Moldavia, hoping that they would no longer blossom.

　　But the Soviet people have completed great labor achievements. The first post-war Five-Year Plan has passed – this is the summary: the Donbass of Ukraine has never given us as much coal as it does now. The factories of Belarus and the Baltic coast have risen from the ruins, and these factories are equipped with machines that have never been seen before. In the Moldavian basin, not only have grapevines been planted, but also subtropical trees that had never grown there before.

　　The arid Samgor Steppe of Georgia is alive today. The fields of Armenia are irrigated with water from Lake Sevan. The Academy of Sciences has been established in Tashkent, and the world's largest canal is being built in Turkmenistan.

　　Nowhere is the will for peace as sharp as it is in places that still bear the traces of war.

　　Recently, the author visited Stalingrad. This is a place where a bloody battle was fought with the fascists not long ago. And now it is a place of great peaceful construction.

　　According to Stalin's proposal, the construction of a large-scale hydroelectric power station on the Volga River has begun near Stalingrad. Vast areas on both sides of the Volga River are being excavated for irrigation canals; the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station can irrigate the formerly arid steppes and semi-desert areas.

　　Another great construction of the Stalin era, the Volga-Don Navigation Canal, is also being built near Stalingrad. This canal will have the most powerful impact on the economic development of the entire southern part of the European part of the Soviet Union.

　　I flew from Moscow to Stalingrad. When you are about to reach the city but cannot see it yet, the excitement of meeting the city seizes your heart. Below the plane, approaching the city, are slightly green, brown, undulating fields. From above, you can see the cleaved earth. The remnants of anti-tank trenches, the winding outlines of trenches, and in some places, unfilled shell craters and bomb craters. These are the wounds of war. But the pain in the heart will soon disappear: there is a straight line across the scarred earth, erasing the traces of war: we see the vibrant Volga-Don Canal bed.

　　Many machines can be seen along the route of this canal. There is no manual labor here. The country, which has quickly recovered from the destruction and damage of the war, supplies its peaceful construction with a large amount of the most complete machinery. On the Volga-Don Canal, I saw a new type of Soviet excavator that can replace ten thousand earthworkers. Now it only takes five people to operate this machine.

　　Not too long ago, Stalingrad was lying in ruins. But recently it has been rebuilt. Now the number of people living in Stalingrad is almost as many as before the fascist invasion.

　　In the center of Stalingrad, a new street runs through rows of new high-rise buildings. What is the name of this street? It is called "Peace Street."

　　Not long ago, the regular Stalin Prizes for outstanding achievements in the cultural sector were evaluated in the Soviet Union. Among the new winners are also people from Stalingrad, Stakhanovite workers from Stalingrad, playwrights from Stalingrad, architects from Stalingrad, theater troupes from Stalingrad...

　　This city, which has won the honor of Hero City, is now living a very peaceful life.

　　I took a trip around Stalingrad. In the arid wormwood-covered wilderness, there are still scattered skeletons of Hitler bandit vehicles in some places. There are rusty oil tanks full of bullet holes. In the valley, there is a Hitler soldier's helmet... On this fighting and victorious land, the wide roads of young forest belts now lead to the horizon. I saw many small oak trees that were only one year old. These small trees were planted according to the great Stalin plan for transforming nature to prevent the harmful effects of drought.

　　Peace has triumphed over the shadow of war!

　　On the steep bank of the Volga River is the cemetery of the heroes, the defenders of Stalingrad. Geologists' drilling rigs are lined up, which is the location of the future Stalingrad embankment.

　　There are permanent fortifications of cement that have tilted over time. And next to it, a small area has grown into a small city for the construction of hydroelectric power stations.

　　Suddenly, I saw some tall cement towers in the wilderness. What are these? These are the piers of the bridge under construction. Around, below the piers, there is only the undulating grassland – no water, no roads. The water and roads of the canal are still in the future, but the bridge has already grown!

　　This is a reasonable and true moving image of belief in the future.

　　The outline of a peaceful future eliminates the memory of war. This is not only the case in Stalingrad, but also throughout the Soviet Union.

　　The Soviet state is moving forward wholeheartedly. She has successfully solved the basic tasks of the post-war Five-Year Plan. What has been destroyed has been restored, new things have been built, and unprecedented things are being created.

　　The Soviet people are consolidating the cause of peace with their peaceful labor. People of all countries see with what victory the Soviet people are marching along the road of peaceful labor towards a communist future. Inspired by this example, people are striking at the wars that the imperialists want to launch and blocking the road to war.

　　On May Day, in the holiday filled with the peaceful labor of all forces, you will feel this particularly keenly.

### 五一劳动节

专栏：

　　五一劳动节
    苏联作家  米哈依洛夫
    “五一”是一切工人、一切劳动者的节日。劳动是人类生活的基础，而“五一”是国际工人的节日，人们尊敬劳动。
    但是，对于资本主义国家的工人来说，这暂时还是一个向往的节日。因为那里劳动还没有被解放出来，劳动还在被资本家榨取。在“五一”这一天，劳动者对自己解放的信心更加有力地燃烧着。
    然而在苏联与人民民主国家里，这已经是一个属于胜利的节日了。这里的人们是自由的，而他们的劳动已被解放了。在这里，人们有着伟大的成就，他们觉得自己的劳动生活就是真正的幸福。
    在苏联，没有工人为了一片面包而把自己的劳动出卖给他们的资本家。在这里，人们是为了自己，为了自己的祖国，为了人民而劳动的。在苏维埃的国土上，劳动除了不断提高劳动者的生活水平、增加国民的财富、加强祖国的威力以外，没有另外的目的。苏联人民在生气勃勃地劳动着，他们的国家一天比一天变得更富裕，而她的公民也生活得愈来愈好。
    苏联人民在充分享受着和平生活的幸福，并且又在自己的国家里建设着共产主义的、更加美好的将来的时候，他们当然是憎恨战争的。对于帝国主义者的威胁，对于这些战争贩子们的威胁，他们的答复就是：专心的不断地劳动，把自己的全部力量贡献给和平建设。苏联人民和平愿望的证据，在苏联是到处都可以看到的。
    “五一”节这一天，莫斯科的街头充满着愉快的人们。春天的莫斯科是美丽的。而她最美丽的，是随处都可以看得到持久和平以及对未来的信心的显明面貌。
    像一座雕琢过的断岩一样的摩天大楼，可以在城市的屋顶上空的远处看到。这是根据斯大林的提议在莫斯科建造的几个高大建筑物中间的一个。在莫斯科街头你的视线以内，可以看见列宁山上新建的大学校舍，可以看见雅扎河口附近的新的三十二层的高楼，又可以看见高耸在斯摩棱斯克广场上的大楼。这些建筑物，每个人都知道，它的目的都是为了和平的。这是一座即将到来的共产主义的伟大的建筑物。
    在辽阔的苏维埃土地的每个角落里，你都会有这样的感觉。在从波罗的海到太平洋的整个国土上，城市和村庄都像百花开放一样地繁荣起来了。列宁格勒的新运动场，乌拉尔和西伯利亚的工人中心区的文化宫，高加索群山中为工人修建的新疗养院，乌克兰、莫斯科近郊和伏尔加河流域的新村庄——这是集体农场城市的先驱，已经计划好了，已经开始建造了……
    在不久以前的战争日子里，希特勒匪帮用水把乌克兰的矿山淹没了，他们想：淹它个十年。他们破坏了波罗的海沿岸的工厂，他们认为：搞不起来了。他们砍掉了莫尔达维亚的葡萄园，他们希望它不再开花。
    但是，苏联人民已完成了伟大的劳动业绩。战后第一个五年计划过去了——这就是总结：乌克兰的顿巴斯从来没有给我们像现在这样多的煤。白俄罗斯和波罗的海沿岸的工厂从废墟中耸立了起来，这些工厂里，装备了以前未曾有过的机器。在莫尔达维亚盆地，不仅种植了葡萄树，而且还种植了从前那里不曾生长过的亚热带的树木。
    格鲁吉亚干枯的萨姆高尔草原，今天复活了。阿尔明尼亚的田野上浸进了西高湖的水分。在塔什克斯坦开办了科学院，在土库曼建筑着世界上最大的运河。
    无论在什么地方，和平的意志都没有像在还保留着战争痕迹的地方那样的尖锐。
    最近，作者曾访问过斯大林格勒。这是一个不久以前与法西斯血战的地方。而现在这里已是一个伟大的和平建设的地方了。
    根据斯大林的提议，在斯大林格勒附近，伏尔加河上规模宏大的水力发电站的建设已经开始了。伏尔加河两岸广阔的地带，开凿着灌溉的运河；斯大林格勒水力发电站，可以灌溉从前干燥的草原和半沙漠地带。
    斯大林时代的另一个伟大的建设，伏尔加河——顿河航行运河，也正在斯大林格勒附近建筑着。这条运河对于苏联欧洲部分的整个南部的经济发展，给予最有力的影响。
    我是坐飞机从莫斯科飞到斯大林格勒的、当你快要到这个城市但还看不见它的时候，即将与这个城市会面的那种兴奋就抓住了你的心。在飞机下面快要到达这个城市的地方，是微绿的、褐色的、波浪起伏的田野。你从上空可以看到被割裂的大地。反坦克壕沟的残迹，弯弯曲曲的战壕的轮廓，有些地方还有着没填起来的炮弹坑和炸弹坑。这是战争的创伤。但心中的痛楚马上就会消失：这里有一条平直的线穿过伤痕斑斑的大地，它抹去了战争的痕迹：我们看见朝气勃勃的伏尔加河——顿河运河的河床。
    在这条运河要经过的路线上，可以看到许多机器。在这里，手工的劳动是没有的。从战争的破坏和损伤中很快恢复过来的这个国家，她以最完备的机械大量地供给自己的和平建设。在伏尔加河——顿河运河上，我看见了一个能代替一万个土工劳动的新式的苏维埃的挖掘机。现在操纵这架机器只用五个人。
    在不太久以前，斯大林格勒还躺在废墟之中。但最近它已经重建起来。现在生活在斯大林格勒的人，差不多已经和法西斯入侵以前同样的多了。
    在斯大林格勒的中心，一条新的大街穿过了一排一排的新的高楼。这条大街叫什么呢？它叫“和平街”。
    不久以前，在苏联举行了给予文化部门中有卓越成就的例行的斯大林奖金的评定会。在新的获奖人中间也有斯大林格勒人，有斯大林格勒的斯达哈诺夫工人，有斯大林格勒的剧作家，有斯大林格勒的建筑师，有斯大林格勒的剧团……
    获得了英雄城荣誉的这个城市，现在正过着极其和平的生活。
    我环绕着斯大林格勒作了一次旅行。在干燥的长着苦艾的原野上，有些地方至今还散乱着希特勒匪帮车辆的骨架。那里有满是弹孔的、生锈的油槽。在山谷中有一个希特勒士兵的钢盔……在这战斗的和胜利的土地上，年轻的森林带的宽广的道路，现在一直通向天边。我看见许多才长了一年的小檞树。这些小树是根据伟大的改造自然的斯大林计划，为防止旱灾的有害影响而种植的。
    和平战胜了战争的阴影！
    在伏尔加河峭峻的岸上，是英雄们的、斯大林格勒保卫者的公墓。地质学家的钻探机排列着，那是未来的斯大林格勒堤防的所在地。
    那里有因日久天长而倾斜了的水泥的永久工事。而旁边的一片不大的地带上，生长起水力发电站建筑的小城。
    忽然，我看见旷野中有一些高大的水泥塔。这是什么呢？这是正在建筑的大桥的桥墩。在周围，在桥墩的下面，只有起伏着的草原——没有水，也没有道路。运河的水和道路还只是将来的事，而桥已经成长起来了！
    这是合理的、真实的对未来信念的动人形象。
    和平的未来的轮廓消灭了战争的记忆。这不仅在斯大林格勒是这样，就是在苏联各地也是这样。
    苏维埃国家是一心一意向前迈进的。她顺利地解决了战后五年计划的基本任务。破坏了的东西已被恢复起来，新的东西已被建筑起来，而前所未见的东西也正在被创造着。
    苏联人民以自己的和平劳动巩固着和平事业。各国的人们都看到，苏联人民带着怎样的胜利，沿着和平劳动的道路向共产主义的将来迈进。为这一范例所鼓舞的人们，打击着帝国主义者所想发动的战争，阻拦着战争的道路。
    在“五一”节这天，在充满着一切力量的和平劳动的节日里，你会特别敏锐地感到这个。
