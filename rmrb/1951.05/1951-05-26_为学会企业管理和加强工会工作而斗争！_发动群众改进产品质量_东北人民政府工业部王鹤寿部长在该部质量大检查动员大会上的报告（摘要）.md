In the process of restoring and developing state-owned industry in Northeast China over the past two years, certain achievements have been made in improving product quality. In the past, the quality of light bulbs was extremely poor, but now it can guarantee a standard lifespan of more than 1,000 hours; the quality of cement has reached the planned standard specifications and has gained credibility in the market; rubber shoes have changed their "Sunday shoe" reputation; the proportion of first-class paper has gradually increased.... This not only demonstrates the achievements of all employees, technicians, and cadres in Northeast China's state-owned industry over the past two years, but also paves the way for producing high-quality products in the future.

However, the main, widespread, and noteworthy problem in Northeast China's state-owned industry is the low quality of products (including capital construction). Almost all products have serious defects in terms of quality.

Machine tools still have four main shortcomings: low cutting ability, poor precision, short lifespan, and a high proportion of third-grade and defective products. It even happens frequently that a machine tool that has been inspected and qualified for storage turns out to be unqualified upon re-inspection a few days later. Asbestos tiles have almost all kinds of defects, such as broken surfaces, rough surfaces, fractures, delamination, bending, water leakage, and skewness. Especially the phenomena of fracture and water leakage are the most serious, which directly affects the quality of capital construction and causes great losses to the state. Rubber shoes have outdated styles, and for more than two years, rubber shoes with quality and styles welcomed by the masses have not been produced. Cotton cloth has many neps, poor luster, is rough, and not durable, still lagging behind products from within the customs.

The quality problems in capital construction are even more serious. The quality of civil construction and installation engineering is far from reaching the required level, especially civil construction engineering. Many of our newly built factory buildings and dormitories leak rain as soon as they are completed, and even a strong wind can blow off a large piece of the roof.

After studying the issue of product quality, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government specifically proposed a major quality inspection campaign and put forward several tasks, requiring all business departments to study and implement them.

  I. Overcome ideological obstacles

    Many cadres, after seeing some improvement in product quality, often forget the other serious shortcomings that exist in quality. Some people even like to align themselves with the backward. Some factories have even self-listed quality grades and lowered quality standards on their own. Some think that only the experience of old workers is enough, neglecting to lead the masses to combine their experience with scientific and technical knowledge. As for thinking that "poor quality products sell well," this only shows that products of two different quality specifications have a wide or narrow range of use, and that inferior quality specifications products also have quality problems.

  II. Establish two correct concepts

    While opposing the above ideas that hinder quality improvement, ideological education should be carried out among all cadres, employees, and technicians: completing the national plan (task) must include three aspects: output, quality, and cost and finance. Completing the quality plan and the cost and finance plan should be regarded as equally important as completing the product quantity plan and a law of the state. Neglecting any aspect will not be considered as completing the plan.

    It is necessary to widely publicize that improving quality is equivalent to creating wealth for the country; poor product quality is equivalent to wasting and destroying national wealth. As long as the above two ideological understandings are established and implemented among all employees, technicians, and cadres, it will become a force for improving product quality.

  III. Concentrate efforts to strengthen technical management

    First of all, designs and drawings must be strictly reviewed. It is necessary to resolutely prohibit the indiscriminate use of designs that are obviously outdated. At the same time, it must be strictly stipulated that design drawings that have been reviewed and approved shall not be arbitrarily changed without the approval of the original approval authority.

    It is necessary to formulate quality standard specifications for major products and revise and add technical operating procedures. Strictly define technical operating procedures as factory rules and regulations. To formulate and abide by technical operating procedures, it is necessary to use the work method of Kovalev, discover good operating methods, summarize them comprehensively, formulate them into procedures, and then submit them to workers for discussion, so that all employees can master them and promote them. Factories and mines that already have standard operating procedures should vigorously promote them and strive to implement them. Carry out a serious and irreconcilable struggle against the phenomenon of deliberately lowering quality standards and lack of discipline. Strengthen technical organizations, clearly define the powers and responsibilities of technical personnel, give strong support administratively, and give full play to the role of technical departments.

    It is necessary to strictly implement the technical inspection system and supervision system (which is the supervision system in the capital construction department). The scope of inspection must not only include finished products, but also a series of processes from raw materials, semi-finished products to finished products. All new products must go through a strict trial production stage; trial production procedures should be stipulated, and new products are never allowed to be manufactured in large quantities without trial production. Technical research and testing institutions should be combined with production to study methods for improving product quality.

  IV. Master policies related to quality issues

    Product pricing policies must guarantee the promotion of quality. Some existing prices that reward backwardness have lost their role in stimulating quality improvement and need to be corrected. Wage policies and reward systems must be adapted to improving quality, and the past practice of only rewarding over-fulfillment of output without rewarding quality must be changed.

  V. Establish a liaison system between factories and mines and users

    Each bureau (company) and each factory and mine should treat soliciting opinions from users (including department stores) as their own working system, and regularly assign someone to be responsible for soliciting opinions from users. The system of compensation and the system of guaranteed repair should be promoted as much as possible to promote the production unit's attention to quality.

  VI. Regularly hold professional technical meetings

    The special steel quality conference held by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government last year and several professional meetings this year to solve technical problems have proved that a professional meeting on a specific technical problem can solve problems better than a comprehensive technical meeting, and plays a greater role in exchanging experience and improving quality. This method should be widely promoted.

The quality inspection campaign is a starting point for improving quality, and improving quality is an important key to making a big step forward in Northeast China's state-owned industry. We should concentrate our efforts, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and strive to improve quality!

### 为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！  发动群众改进产品质量——东北人民政府工业部王鹤寿部长在该部质量大检查动员大会上的报告（摘要）

　　为学会企业管理和加强工会工作而斗争！
    发动群众改进产品质量
    ——东北人民政府工业部王鹤寿部长在该部质量大检查动员大会上的报告（摘要）
    东北国营工业两年多以来的恢复与发展过程中，在产品质量改进上，取得了一定的成绩。过去电灯泡质量极差，现在已能保证一千小时以上的标准寿命；水泥的质量已经达到计划的标准规格，在市场上取得了信誉；胶鞋改变了“礼拜鞋”称号；纸张的一等品比例逐渐提高……。这不仅表明了东北国营工业全体职工、技术人员与干部在两年多的过程中所达到的成绩，而且给今后生产品质优良的产品开辟了道路。
    但目前东北国营工业中主要的、普遍的与值得严重注意的仍是产品（包括基本建设）质量低劣的问题。几乎所有产品在质量方面都有严重的缺陷。
    工作母机现在仍存在着四个主要缺点：切削能力低、精密度差、寿命短、三级品及废品比例大。甚至经常发生已经检查合格入库的床子，过几天再检查时又变成了不合格的。石棉瓦的破面、麻面、断裂、起层、弯曲、透水、偏斜等毛病几乎应有尽有，特别是断裂与透水现象最严重，这就直接影响到基本建设的质量，给国家造成很大损失。胶鞋式样陈旧，两年多以来始终还没有制出质量与式样为群众所欢迎的胶鞋。棉布疙疸多、光彩差、粗劣、不耐穿，依旧赶不上关内产品。
    基本建设方面的质量问题更严重。土木建筑工程及按装工程质量远没有达到应有的水平。特别是土木建筑工程。我们许多新盖的厂房及宿舍刚盖完即漏雨，甚至一场大风可以把房盖吹掉一大块。
    东北人民政府工业部研究了产品质量问题后，特别提出质量大检查运动，并提出几项工作，要求所有企业部门研究执行。
  一、克服思想障碍
    许多干部看到产品质量的部分改善之后，常常忘记了质量上所存在的其他严重缺点。甚至有些人喜欢向落后看齐。有的工厂还曾经自列质量等级，把质量标准自行降低。有的以为只要有老工人的经验就行，忽略领导群众使他们的经验与科学的技术知识相结合。至于认为“质量差的销路倒大”，其实这只是表明两种不同质量规格的产品使用范围有广有窄，而且次等质量规格的产品也同样存在着质量问题。
            二、树立两种正确的观念
    与反对以上妨碍质量改善的思想同时，应该在所有干部、职工与技术人员中进行这样的思想教育：完成国家计划（任务）必须包括产量、质量和成本财务三个方面。要把完成质量计划、成本财务计划与完成产品数量计划同样看成为国家的法规。偏废了某一方面，都不能算做完成计划。
    要广泛宣传：提高质量等于为国家创造了财富；产品质量低劣等于浪费和破坏了国家财富。只要在所有职工、技术人员与干部中树立和贯彻了以上两种思想认识，那就会变成改进产品质量的力量。
            三、集中力量加强技术管理
    首先要严格审查设计和图纸。要坚决禁止无选择地沿用显然已经陈旧过时的设计。同时还要严格规定：经过审查批准的设计图纸，不经原批准机构的批准，不允许随意更改。
    要制订主要产品的质量标准规格与修正、增订技术操作规程。严格地把技术操作规程定为厂规厂法。制订与遵守技术操作规程，必需运用郭瓦廖夫的工作方法，发现好的操作方法，加以综合总结，制订成为规程，然后交付工友讨论，使所有职工都能掌握，加以推广。已有标准操作法的厂矿即应大力推行，务求贯彻。向故意降低质量标准和无纪律现象进行严肃的不调和的斗争。要充实技术组织，明确地规定技术人员的职权，行政上要给以有力的支持，充分发挥技术部门的作用。
    要严格执行技术检验制度和监督制度（在基本建设部门就是监工制度）。检查范围不仅只是成品，而且必须包括从原材料、半成品至成品一系列的过程。所有新产品，都要经过严格的试制阶段；应规定试制规程，绝不允许新产品不经试作即行大量制造。技术研究和化验机构要与生产结合，研究产品质量改进方法。
            四、掌握有关质量问题的政策
    产品价格政策必须保证促进质量。现存的一部分奖励落后的价格，失去了刺激提高质量的作用，需加以改正。工资政策与奖励制度必须与改善质量相适应，要改变过去只奖励超额完成产量而不奖励质量的办法。
            五、建立厂矿与用户联系制度
    各管理局（公司）、各厂矿应把征询用户（包括百货公司）意见当作自己的工作制度，定期地有专人负责地向用户征询意见。应尽可能地提倡包赔制度和包修制度，以促进生产单位重视质量。
            六、经常召开专业的技术会议
    东北人民政府工业部去年的特殊钢质量会议和今年的几次解决技术问题的专业会议，都证明一个具体技术问题的专业会议比综合性的技术会议更能解决问题，对交流经验提高质量起的作用很大，要大量推广这种方法。
    质量检查运动是改善质量的一个起点，而改善质量是使东北国营工业向前迈一大步的重要关键。我们应集中力量，发动群众，依靠群众，为改善质量而奋斗！
