　　Why is the policy of "sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, and observation of future behavior" implemented for certain counter-revolutionary criminals?
    Question: Recently, Beijing dealt with a group of counter-revolutionary criminals, some of whom were subjected to the policy of sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, and observation of future behavior. Is there any danger in this approach? Will it weaken our struggle against counter-revolutionaries? Is it a waste of millet? Since they are to be reformed but also sentenced to death, isn't this a mental burden for the prisoners?
    Answer: The reason for sentencing some counter-revolutionary criminals to death with a two-year reprieve is that these criminals should be executed according to their crimes. However, because they have no blood debts, public indignation is not very great, or their damage to national interests has not reached the most serious level, this method of temporarily not killing them, granting a two-year reprieve, and forcing them to reform through labor is adopted to give them a final chance to repent. If they show genuine transformation in the two years, they can be commuted to life imprisonment and undergo long-term labor reform. If they perform even better, commutation may be considered. If they perform poorly and refuse reform, the death penalty can be carried out at any time.
    This method is certainly lenient. But is this leniency dangerous? Is it harmful to the interests of the state and the people? Will it shake the seriousness of our struggle against counter-revolutionaries? Our answer is no. A two-year reprieve does not mean that they will be released immediately after two years, but that the decision to kill or not kill will be based on their performance during these two years. If they perform poorly and refuse reform, they can be killed at any time. Even if they show a willingness to reform, they must be sentenced to life imprisonment or a long-term imprisonment, which deprives them of any possibility of harming the people again.
    Is a two-year reprieve a waste of millet? We believe it is not. The People's Government will organize and force them to engage in labor production and not let them eat millet for nothing. Forcing them to engage in labor production can not only save the state's millet but also produce "millet" for the state. This is both a punishment and a reform; it is both beneficial to certain national production and construction undertakings and reduces the burden on the people.
    Since they are to be reformed, why sentence them to death and give the criminals a mental burden? We believe that the death sentence is because their past crimes deserve the death penalty. The two-year reprieve now is to give them an opportunity for reform in the future. This is not increasing the burden but reducing it. If we must say that this is a burden, then this burden is also necessary. Because these criminals should have been executed, but we still want to give them a way out and give them a final chance for reform. Therefore, even if we give them a little burden and force them to reform themselves even more, isn't this also appropriate and necessary?
    In short, our policy of eliminating counter-revolutionaries is unwavering, but there is more than one way to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve is a new method, the purpose of which is still to completely eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and not to weaken the resolute struggle against counter-revolutionaries. The People's Government neither relaxes its severe suppression of resolute counter-revolutionary elements, nor abandons any hope of reforming counter-revolutionary elements. This is in line with the interests of the people, is more conducive to the complete elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and is the implementation of the correct policy of combining suppression and leniency.

### 为什么对某些反革命罪犯实行“判处死刑、缓期两年、强迫劳动、以观后效”的政策？

　　为什么对某些反革命罪犯实行“判处死刑、缓期两年、强迫劳动、以观后效”的政策？
    问：最近北京市处理了一批反革命罪犯，其中一部分是采取判处死刑、缓期两年执行、强迫劳动、以观后效的政策。这种处理办法是否有危险性？是否会减弱我们同反革命的斗争？是否会白浪费小米？既然要加以改造而又判处以死刑，这是不是给犯人的一个精神负担？
    答：对一部分反革命罪犯判处死刑、缓期两年执行的理由是：这一部分罪犯，按其罪行是应该处死的，但是因为他们没有血债，民愤不很大，或者他们对国家利益的损害尚未达到最严重程度，所以才采取这种暂时不杀、缓期两年执行、强迫劳动改造的办法，给以最后悔改的机会。如果他们在两年中表现确有真诚转变，可以改判无期徒刑，经过长期劳动改造；如果他们表现更好，还可以考虑改判；如果他们表现不好，拒绝改造，随时都可以执行死刑。
    这个办法当然是一种宽大。但这种宽大是否有危险性呢？对国家和人民的利益是否有危害呢？是不是会动摇了我们同反革命斗争的严肃性呢？我们的答复是不会的。缓刑两年并不是说过了两年后就马上放掉，而是根据他在这两年内表现的好坏决定杀与不杀。如果表现不好，拒绝改造，随时可以杀掉。即使表现愿意改好，也得判处无期或长期徒刑，这也就剥夺了他们再去危害人民的各种可能。
    缓刑两年是不是浪费小米呢？我们认为是不会的。人民政府将要组织并强迫他们劳动生产，不让他们白吃小米。强迫他们劳动生产，不但可以节省国家的小米，而且可以替国家生产“小米”。这既是惩罚他们，又是改造他们；既有利于国家某些生产建设事业，同时又减轻了人民的负担。
    既然要改造他们，何必要判处以死刑，给罪犯一个精神负担呢？我们认为判处死刑是因为他过去的罪恶应该判处死刑，现在缓期两年执行是今后仍给他以改造的机会。这不是加重负担而是减轻了负担。如果一定要说这是一种负担的话，那末，这种负担也是必要的。因为这种罪犯本应处死，可是我们还要给他以生路，给他们一个最后改造的机会。因此，即令给了他们一点负担，更多地逼迫他们去改造自己，这难道不也是应该的和必要的么？
    总之，我们消灭反革命的方针是坚定不移的，但消灭反革命的办法则不只一个。判处死刑缓期两年执行是一个新办法，其目的还是为了要彻底消灭反革命，而不是减弱同反革命的坚决斗争。人民政府既不放松对于坚决的反革命分子的严厉镇压，也不放弃对反革命分子可以进行改造的任何一线希望。这是符合于人民利益的，是更有利于彻底消灭反革命的，是贯彻镇压与宽大相结合的正确政策。
