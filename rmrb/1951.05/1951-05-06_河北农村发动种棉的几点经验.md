Several Experiences in Mobilizing Cotton Planting in Rural Hebei
By our special correspondent, Dong Dong

In order to achieve this year's cotton planting task, Hebei Province made full preparations in various places before the spring plowing. In addition to accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, the principle of "organization first" was implemented, and the work of mutual aid teams was reorganized, expanded and strengthened. Daming County universally reorganized and expanded the organization of mutual aid teams. At present, there are more than 12,100 mutual aid teams in the county. In Shicaofang village, District Four of the county, 15 groups were added. Farmers in various places actively purchased livestock and farm implements. The mutual aid teams in only four counties, Dingxing, Xushui, Qingyuan, and Mancheng, bought 296 waterwheels. In terms of improving technology, various places widely used training classes, exhibitions, labor model symposiums, technical research groups and other forms to promote advanced experience and production technology. Driven by the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, cotton-producing areas have generally started drought-resistant planting. As of April 28, nearly 6 million mu of cotton have been sown in the province. Now party members and cadres throughout the province are leading farmers to struggle to complete the sowing of 14 million mu of cotton fields. The main experiences in mobilizing the masses to grow cotton are as follows:

First, through patriotic education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, through meetings, accusations, and the signing of patriotic covenants, the patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants has been greatly improved, and the cotton planting competition movement has been promoted. In the propaganda, various places put forward slogans such as "producing one more pound of cotton is equal to increasing the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea," and "strengthening the country and enriching the family, planting more cotton, benefiting oneself, and contributing to the country," which stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm and cotton planting confidence of the vast number of peasants. Many farmers in Daming proposed: "Guarantee to realize the cotton planting plan, planting cotton is the practical action of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea." Cotton farmers in Qiu County unanimously proposed to plant more "Resist-U.S. Cotton" and "Patriotic Cotton." On the basis of the peasants' high patriotic enthusiasm, the province launched a cotton planting competition movement. Zhao County, Luancheng, Lingshou, Jin County, Zanhuang and other counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, through mutual challenges and competitions among farmers, exceeded the original task by more than 97,000 mu in their cotton planting plans. Qiu County launched a patriotic flag-grabbing competition movement throughout the county, formulated flags and certificates of merit, and Zhang Sheng Village mobilized all members of the Women's Federation to participate in planting cotton in order to win the patriotic red flag for cotton planting. Some farmers in Tasha Village, Jin County, said, "Empty words are no proof, actions are the evidence." The village formulated a cotton planting plan of 1,648 mu, exceeding last year's 580 mu, and purchased nearly 70,000 jin of bean cake and a large amount of coarse fertilizer to ensure the realization of the cotton planting task.

Second, in the cotton planting competition, the vast number of labor models, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres carried forward revolutionary heroism, used their own exemplary actions to lead and drive mass production, and brought into play the strength of the organization. In many places, districts and districts, villages and villages, households and households, and mutual aid groups and mutual aid groups have all formulated competition conditions to ensure the completion of the task ahead of schedule. In cotton planting alone, more than 600 labor models across the province wrote to the Provincial People's Government and Chairman Yang Xiufeng, reporting their production plans and challenging labor models in various places. One hundred and sixty-two labor models in Ji County jointly proposed the guarantee conditions for completing the cotton planting task to challenge Gao Guandou, a labor model in Shen County, and reported to the provincial government. Labor models and mutual aid teams in more than 30 counties responded to the challenge of the famous labor models Li Shunda and Zhang Xishun. Basically, a province-wide cotton planting competition movement has been formed. In order to drive the masses to plant more cotton, 26 party members and cadres in Huangjia Street, Chengnan, Wei County, planted all their land with cotton and formed 14 propaganda groups to promote it from house to house. Under their propaganda, explanation and promotion, 26 streets in Chengguan District formulated a cotton planting plan of 1,954 mu, accounting for more than 74 percent of the cultivated land, of which 75 households planted all their spring land with cotton.

Third, strengthening the propaganda work of cotton planting is the key to completing the cotton planting task. At the beginning of cotton planting, many farmers had concerns about expanding cotton fields: such as fearing that cotton prices would fall, fearing that they would not be able to sell if they planted too much cotton, and that more cotton would result in more burdens; fearing shortage of grain, coal, firewood, and grass; fearing that they were not skilled in technology and that they would harvest less cotton; fearing that there was no way to deal with aphids; fearing that they could not plant cotton due to drought, and that drought-resistant planting was too troublesome; some farmers had a self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy; and were unwilling to plant more cotton. In response to the above-mentioned ideological situation, various places organized party members and members of the Communist Youth League, made full use of the propaganda network, and used various forms to focus on publicizing the principles of: "one mu of cotton equals three mu of grain", "if you want to become rich, plant more cotton, which benefits yourself and contributes to the country." The central government promulgated the ten major policies to reward production, and the preparations for coal and grain transportation, and the cotton-grain price ratio policy, cleared the concerns of some farmers. Many farmers in Gaocheng said: "The government's door to reward production is always open. Planting more cotton strengthens the country and enriches the family. We have to plant more this year." Handan Prefecture put forward the slogan "Plant cotton and beans around Grain Rain;" "It is better to start early than late, and the solar term does not allow people" to carry out the education of "man can conquer nature," solved the negative thinking of cotton farmers of "relying on the sky to wait for rain," and promoted drought-resistant planting. Daming put forward the slogans "Drought-resistant planting is heroic, relying on the sky to wait for rain is a big loss," and "Seeing seedlings means 30% harvest." Tang County also put forward the slogans "Waterwheels, wells, and buckets are never idle," and "Make the most of water." Some cadres in Handan County felt that they could not complete the plan by carrying water for planting, so the leadership launched a "detailed accounting" campaign. Each labor force can carry 20 loads of water a day, each load of water can irrigate 30 to 40 pits, and each mu can plant about 1,000 trees, so one person carrying water can plant 0.7 to 1 mu a day. The wage of one worker for one day is only enough for one jin of ginned cotton. Such an accounting raised everyone's confidence in planting, and they all formulated plans for carrying water for planting. Most of the villages started a concentrated campaign to plant cotton from April 16 and completed it all in ten days. In the propaganda in various places, they also paid attention to explaining the methods of preventing and controlling aphids, introduced the treatment methods of using "lime-sulfur mixture" and "tobacco water," and preventive methods such as "weeding and hoeing," eliminating the concerns of cotton farmers about aphids.

Fourth, cadres from cooperatives and cotton yarn companies in various places went to cotton-producing areas to organize the pre-purchase of cotton, in order to break the concerns of cotton farmers about not being able to sell cotton. Handan Prefecture printed a large number of pre-purchase contracts and various propaganda materials to provide materials for party members, members of the Communist Youth League and propagandists to speak. Cadres going to the countryside in Jize took a copy of the pre-purchase contract leaflet and promoted it to the masses. Anguo Cooperative and grass-roots cooperatives began pre-purchasing after in-depth propaganda. In Liujiazhuang, District One, under the leadership of party members, cadres and labor models, 25 households have signed pre-purchase contracts, pre-purchasing more than 8,400 jin of cotton in total. In Qixia Village, Wuji County, Kang Zhazi, the secretary of the Communist Party branch, and Sun Laokang, the village chief, promoted pre-purchase by dividing areas. In less than seven days, 113 of the 210 households in the village signed contracts to pre-purchase 56,086 jin of cotton. As of April 20, according to incomplete statistics from five counties, Ding County, Shenze, Wuji, and Anguo, cotton farmers had pre-sold more than 2.08 million jin.

　　河北农村发动种棉的几点经验
    本报特约记者  董东
    河北省为实现今年的种棉任务，各地在春耕前都作了充分的准备工作。除大量积肥外，都贯彻执行了“组织第一”的方针，重新整顿扩大和加强互助组工作。大名县普遍整顿和扩大了互助组组织，目前全县已有一万二千一百多个互助组。该县四区石曹方一个村就增加了十五个组。各地农民积极购买牲口、农具，仅定兴、徐水、清苑、满城等四个县的互助组即买水车二百九十六辆。在改进技术方面，各地广泛利用了训练班、展览会、劳动模范座谈会、技术研究小组等形式，推广了先进经验和生产技术。在抗美援朝运动推动下，产棉区已普遍开始抗旱点种，截止四月二十八日，全省已播种棉花近六百万亩。现全省党员、干部正领导农民为完成一千四百万亩棉田的播种而斗争。发动群众种棉的主要经验有以下几点：
    第一，是经过了抗美援朝爱国教育，通过集会、控诉、订立爱国公约等方式，大大提高了农民的爱国热情，推动农民开展了种棉竞赛运动。各地在宣传中曾提出：“多产一斤棉花，等于增加了一份抗美援朝的力量”，“强国富家，多种棉花，利在自己，功在国家”等口号，激发了广大农民的爱国热情与种棉信心。大名许多农民提出：“保证实现种棉计划，种棉就是抗美援朝的实际行动”，邱县棉农一致提出多种“抗美棉”、“爱国棉”，在农民爱国热情高涨的基础上，全省开展了种棉竞赛运动。石家庄专区赵县、栾城、灵寿、晋县、赞皇等县经过农民之间的互相挑战竞赛，种棉计划超过了原任务九万七千多亩。邱县全县掀起了爱国主义夺旗竞赛运动，制订了奖旗和奖状，张省村为了争取种棉的爱国红旗，发动了全体妇联会员参加点种棉花。晋县塔上村有的农民说：“空口无凭，行动为证。”全村订出了一千六百四十八亩的种棉计划，超过去年五百八十多亩，购买了近七万斤豆饼和大批粗肥，保证种棉任务实现。
    第二，种棉竞赛中广大劳动模范、党员、团员、干部发扬了革命英雄主义，以自己的模范行动来领导和带动群众生产，并发挥了组织力量。不少地方区与区、村与村、户与户、互助组与互助组都订出了竞赛条件，保证提前完成任务。仅种棉中全省即有六百多劳动模范上书省人民政府和杨秀峰主席，报告生产计划，向各地劳动模范挑战。冀县一百六十二名劳动模范联名提出完成种棉任务的保证条件向深县劳动模范高贯斗挑战，并向省政府作报告。有三十多县的劳动模范和互助组向著名的劳动模范李顺达及张希顺应战。基本上已形成了全省范围的种棉竞赛运动。为了带动广大群众多种棉花，威县城内黄家街二十六个党员干部把所有土地都种上了棉花，并组成十四个宣传小组，挨户宣传。城关区二十六街在他们宣传解释与推动下，订出了一千九百五十四亩的种棉计划，占耕地百分之七十四强，其中有七十五户把全部春地完全都种上棉花。
    第三，加强种棉的宣传工作，是完成种棉任务的关键。在种棉开始时有很多农民对扩大棉田存有顾虑：如怕棉价落、怕种棉多了卖不出去、棉花多了多纳负担；怕缺粮、煤、柴、草；怕技术不熟练，棉花收的少；怕生蚜虫没办法；怕天旱地干不能种棉，抗旱点种太费事；一部分农民则存有自给自足的小农经济思想；不愿多种棉花。针对上述思想情况，各地组织了党员、团员，充分使用宣传网，利用各种形式着重宣传了：“一亩棉三亩田”，“要发家多种花，利在自己，功在国家”的道理，中央人民政府颁布奖励生产的十大政策，和煤粮调运的准备工作，和棉粮比价政策等，扫清了部分农民的顾虑。藁城很多农民说：“政府奖励生产的门常开着，多种棉又强国又发家，今年得要多种”。邯郸专区提出“谷雨前后，撒花种豆”；“赶早不赶晚，节气不饶人”的口号进行了“人能胜天”的教育，解决了棉农“靠天等雨”的消极思想，推动了抗旱点种。大名提出：“抗旱点种是英雄、靠天等雨吃大亏”，“见苗三分收”的口号。唐县也提出：“水车、水井、水桶三不闲”，“水尽其用”的口号。邯郸县有的干部觉着挑水点种完不成计划，领导上即发动了“算细账”运动。每个劳动力每天能担二十挑水，每担水能浇三十到四十个坑，每亩能种一千棵上下，一人挑水每天就能种七分到一亩。一个工一天只一斤多皮棉的工资就够了。这么一算账就提高了大家的点种信心，纷纷订了担水点种计划。大部分村庄从四月十六日起突击种棉，十天全部完成，各地宣传中还注意讲解了防、治蚜虫的方法，介绍了用“石灰、硫磺合剂”与“烟叶水”的治法，和“锄草、锄地”等预防法，消除了棉农怕蚜虫的顾虑。
    第四，各地合作社、花纱布公司干部，分赴产棉区组织预购棉花，以打破棉农怕棉花卖不出去的顾虑。邯郸专区大量印制了预购合同，和各种宣传材料，供给党员、团员和宣传员讲话材料。鸡泽下乡干部每人都带一份预购合同传单，向群众宣传。安国合作社和基层社，经过深入宣传后开始预购，一区刘家庄，在党员、干部及劳动模范的带动下，已有二十五户订出预购合同，共预购棉花八千四百多斤。无极县齐下村，中共支部书记康渣子和村长孙老康分片宣传，带动预购，不到七天的工夫，全村二百一十户中就有一百十三户订立了预购棉花五万六千零八十六斤的合同。到四月二十日，据定县、深泽、无极、安国等五个县不完全统计棉农已预卖了二百零八万多斤。
