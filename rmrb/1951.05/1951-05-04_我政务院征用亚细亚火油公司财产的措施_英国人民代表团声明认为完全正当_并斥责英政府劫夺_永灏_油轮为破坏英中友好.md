　　Measures of Our Government Administration Council to Requisition the Property of Asiatic Petroleum Company Are Considered Completely Just by the British People's Delegation, Which Also Condemns the British Government's Robbery of the "Yong Hao" Tanker as Sabotaging Sino-British Friendship

　　【Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd】The British People's Delegation to China issued the following statement on the 2nd regarding the Chinese Central People's Government's requisition of the property of the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company within our country, excluding the general company and branch offices and sales offices:

　　The British People's Delegation to China announces that it considers the Chinese People's Government's requisition of all the property of the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company, except for the offices and sales offices of its head office and branches, to be completely just.

　　Just before we were about to leave London, we heard that the British authorities in Hong Kong had taken unreasonable action, with the support of the British Colonial Office, to forcibly confiscate and rob the "Yong Hao" oil tanker, a state-owned property of the People's Republic of China, which was docked for repairs in Hong Kong.

　　This groundless action, almost unprecedented in relations between countries during peacetime, cannot but be regarded as a very serious incident by the new China. This also runs counter to the British people's understanding of correct and proper relations between friendly countries.

　　The delegation pointed out that the Hong Kong authorities confiscated the oil tanker without compensation, while the Chinese People's Government has announced that it will pay for the oil reserves of the Asiatic Petroleum Company.

　　Provocative acts by the British government, such as the robbery of the "Yong Hao" oil tanker, can only damage the friendly relations between Britain and China, hinder the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, and undermine the urgently needed Sino-British trade for Britain. Therefore, such behavior increases international tension and directly violates the interests of the British people.

　　我政务院征用亚细亚火油公司财产的措施
    英国人民代表团声明认为完全正当
    并斥责英政府劫夺“永灏”油轮为破坏英中友好
    【新华社三日讯】英国人民访问中国代表团于二日就中国中央人民政府征用英国在我国境内的亚细亚火油公司事发表声明如下：
    英国人民访问中国代表团宣布，它认为中国人民政府征用英商亚细亚火油公司除其总公司和分支机构之办公处及推销处以外的全部财产一举是完全正当的。
    就在我们要离开伦敦之前，我们听到了香港英国当局采取无理行动，在英国殖民事务部的支持下，以武力没收和劫夺了停在香港船坞修理的中华人民共和国国有财产“永灏”油轮。
    这种毫无理由的、在和平时期各国间关系上几乎史无前例的行动，不能不被新中国认为是非常严重的事件。这也有背乎英国人对于友好国家间之正确与正当关系的认识。
    访问团指出，香港当局无偿地没收油轮，中国人民政府则已经宣布要偿付亚细亚火油公司存油的代价。
    英国政府像劫夺“永灏”油轮的这类挑衅行为，只能损害英国与中国之间的友好关系，阻碍两国正式外交关系的建立和破坏英国如此迫切需要的英中贸易。因此，这种行为增加了国际间的紧张状态，并且直接违反了英国人民的利益。
