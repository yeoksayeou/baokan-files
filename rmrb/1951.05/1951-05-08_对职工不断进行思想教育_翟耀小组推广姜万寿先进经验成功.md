　　Constantly Conduct Ideological Education for Employees
    Zhai Yao Group Successfully Promotes Jiang Wanshou's Advanced Experience
    The Zhai Yao group in the Northeast Garment Factory No. 1 successfully promoted Jiang Wanshou's advanced experience and became an advanced group in the Northeast garment industry. This was the result of continuous ideological education of workers. In September of last year, the administration and trade union of Garment Factory No. 1 decided to promote Jiang Wanshou's experience throughout the factory and identified the Zhai Yao group as the focus of the promotion. However, with the exception of group leader Zhai Yao, few in the group agreed with this measure. Productive workers feared that working on a single product with unskilled helpers would reduce product quality and affect the completion of production tasks. Some workers with more personal plans feared that rework would reduce their wage income (because the factory had a piece-rate wage system); or they worried that even if they increased production, the helper would take the wages for the extra production.

    Zhai Yao explained and persuaded the workers about these concerns. He used the specific results of Jiang Wanshou's experiment in the Seventh Workshop to illustrate the benefits of improving labor organization. At the same time, he also appropriately criticized some workers' conservative thinking. In this way, the thinking of some workers was turned around. But everyone still participated in this labor organization reform with an attitude of trying it out.

    This work did not go smoothly. In the five days after adding helpers, not only did the group's output not increase, but many phenomena of disunity appeared. In the past, each product was completed by skilled workers alone. Now, in addition to sewing, other tasks such as fitting, marking, and buttonholing were done by helpers, so skilled workers felt very awkward. On the helper side, because most of them were unskilled female workers, the time spent on making things longer, shorter, fatter, and thinner was often several times more than that of skilled workers, so they often could not supply the needs of skilled workers. Even if they barely supplied them, non-standard phenomena often occurred. Therefore, skilled workers complained about helpers, and helpers were not convinced by the accusations of skilled workers. Quarrels occurred from time to time, and the enthusiasm for production was low.

    On the sixth day, with the help of the administration and the trade union, Zhai Yao analyzed in detail the main reasons for this phenomenon, which was that skilled workers and helpers lacked the spirit of mutual consultation and mutual assistance. Zhai Yao then convened a group-wide work review meeting to encourage each worker to fully express their opinions. At the meeting, skilled workers and helpers spoke very enthusiastically and put forward many specific requirements to each other. Zhai Yao seized everyone's requests and immediately suggested that skilled workers and helpers sign a contact contract: the skilled workers guaranteed to patiently teach the helpers the skills of various miscellaneous tasks, and to consult each other in their work and not lose their temper. The helpers should guarantee to learn humbly and work seriously according to specifications. After his opinion was approved by everyone, the contact contract was signed, and the phenomenon of disunity within the group was eliminated from then on, and the output increased rapidly. Within half a month, the average amount of work done by each person increased by 80% compared with the past, and each person's wages also increased by an average of about 40% compared with the past. The production enthusiasm of all workers in the group was very high, and they felt that Jiang Wanshou's method did not require increasing machines, and almost turned one factory into two factories.

### 对职工不断进行思想教育  翟耀小组推广姜万寿先进经验成功

　　对职工不断进行思想教育
    翟耀小组推广姜万寿先进经验成功
    东北被服一厂翟耀小组推广姜万寿先进经验并成为东北被服业中的先进小组，是不断对工人进行了思想教育的结果。去年九月，被服一厂的行政和工会决定在全厂推广姜万寿经验，并确定翟耀小组为推广工作中的重点。但除小组长翟耀以外，全组很少有人赞同这一措施。生产积极的工人害怕和不熟练的帮工共同作一件活会降低产品质量，影响生产任务不能完成。某些个人打算较多的工人怕出返工活，减少了自己的工资收入（因该厂是计件工资制）；或者耽心即使提高了产量，多生产部分的工资也会被帮工拿去。
    翟耀对工人的这些顾虑进行了解释说服工作。他拿姜万寿在第七车间试验的具体成效来说明改进劳动组织的好处。同时也适当地批评了某些工人的保守思想。这样，一部分工人的思想才算扭转过来。但大家仍是抱着尝试的态度来参加这一劳动组织的改革。
    这一工作进行得很不顺利。在增加帮工以后的五天中，组内产量不但没有提高，反而出现了许多不团结的现象。过去每件产品都由技工一手完成，现在除了缝纫外，其他的配活、划线、扎眼等都由帮工来做，所以技工感到很不顺手。在帮工方面，由于大部是不熟练的女工，作活时比长、比短、比肥、比瘦所费去的时间，往往比技工要多几倍，所以常常供不上技工的需要，即使勉强供上，也常发生不合规格的现象。因此技工埋怨帮工，帮工也不服技工的指责，彼此间争吵时有发生，生产情绪低落。
    第六天，翟耀在行政与工会的帮助下，详细地分析了产生这一现象的主要原因，是技工与帮工缺乏互相商量互相帮助的精神。翟耀随即召开全组工作检讨会，启发每个工人充分发表意见。会上技工与帮工们发言十分踊跃，相互提出许多具体要求。翟耀抓住大家的要求，立刻建议技工与帮工订立联系合同：技工方面保证做到耐心教给帮工作各种零杂活的技术，在工作中要互相商量，不发脾气。帮工方面应保证虚心学习，认真地按照规格作活。他的意见得到大家赞成后，联系合同订立了，组内不团结的现象就从此消除，产量也迅速提高。半月内，平均每人所做的活，比过去提高了百分之八十，每人的工资也比过去平均增加了百分之四十左右。全组工人的生产热情十分高涨，感到姜万寿这个办法并不要增加机器，就几乎把一个工厂变成了两个工厂。
