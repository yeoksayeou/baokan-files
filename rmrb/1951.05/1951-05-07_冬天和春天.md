Korean Correspondence

　　Winter and Spring
    Wei Wei
    The spring, full of vitality, has come to the Korean front line where light and darkness are struggling throughout the world. Before this season, the Chinese and Korean People's troops went through a whole winter of fighting side by side, defeating the biggest and last dying enemy of the world's people—American imperialism, puncturing the paper tiger's skin, and shattering the myth of the invincibility of American imperialism. But for the people, this arduous and victorious journey is only a preparation to welcome greater victories: this is a fruitful winter, pregnant with even greater and more glorious spring.
    Let me use a commander's conversation to illustrate.
    One evening, a regimental commander and I were sitting in a small house. The wind blowing in from the window was soft and full of the taste of spring, so we talked freely.
    "You ask me about the gains of the troops in the winter battle? Well, it's really quite rich." He said excitedly, and then pointed to the electric carbine hanging on the wall and said, "First of all, let's take the most obvious one. This new type of carbine was only started to be used by the Americans in this Korean War, but from the day they came into contact with us, they were continuously handed over to us. The guns captured from the enemy are now lined up with our guns. I think we can take these things back to fight the enemy, you think, will our firepower in future operations not be strengthened!"
    "Secondly, I think it is very valuable that we have enriched ourselves and improved ourselves in the battle with the enemy equipped with modern equipment." He seemed very eager to emphasize this point: "Perhaps, for me personally, I feel it more prominent. Among the cadres of several regiments, I am the youngest. Therefore, in these months, my mind has hardly really rested, I am completely immersed in practical learning. Now, I feel that I have improved, and what I have gained may be more than going to military school for several years, and it is more my own. In command, I feel more confident each time. The preciousness of this gain may not be appreciated by ordinary people, but for a commander, it is more joyous than a farmer seeing a full barn of grain." Speaking of this, he suddenly laughed with a hearty voice: "Don't you think it's strange, these few campaigns are so coincidental, as if intentionally to exercise us in all aspects: the first and second campaigns - exercised our ability to annihilate the enemy through mobile warfare, the third campaign - exercised the ability to storm strongholds, and the fourth campaign - came up with a blocking action. In the past, our tactical superiority has already surprised the enemy, and in the future, we will surprise the enemy even more."
    Speaking of this, he seemed very excited, and a strange smile appeared on his face. This kind of smile is only seen on commanders when the battle is over victoriously. He continued:
    "In the gains, there is something tangible, such as the carbine and howitzer just mentioned, which can be seen; and there is something that you can't easily see on the surface, something intangible, that is, people's thoughts and will. But you must not underestimate this intangible thing, when the guns sound, you can see that the power of this thing is amazing. This is one of the main factors determining the victory or defeat of the war. This time abroad, I feel that everyone in our army has read two important 'textbooks'. One is the 'determination textbook' and the other is the 'confidence textbook'. As soon as we crossed the river, the comrades first read a 'determination textbook', this textbook was written by the American aggressors with their bombs, incendiary bombs and the blood of the Korean people. When we crossed the Yalu River and saw rubble everywhere and victims of massacre everywhere, everyone not only recognized the face of American imperialism, but also recognized what its bones were made of. At the mention of American imperialism, everyone hated it so much that their eyes turned red. We recognized the plight of the Korean people today, and also recognized the threats to our motherland. We love our motherland and the suffering Korean people even more. This 'textbook' makes us willing to be smashed to pieces as long as we can eliminate the invaders. In addition, after these four campaigns, under the support of the above determination, we have always been the victors. In this, there is a 'confidence textbook', this 'confidence textbook' says: 'The American aggressors and their accomplices can be completely defeated, although the enemy is well-equipped and has naval and air superiority, it can still be defeated.' These two 'textbooks' are not written in ink, but in blood. We have already defeated the enemy with superior equipment under the past conditions, and with the improvement of equipment and the continued improvement of tactics and technology in the future, we will definitely create greater victories in the future and bury the American invading army and its accomplices on the Korean peninsula!"
    When he finished these words, he seemed very serious and stopped for several minutes.
    "I think there is still a gain on our side." He said: "That is, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is becoming more and more intimate, deeper and more united. This kind of unity can no longer be described by ordinary nouns, and can no longer be separated by any force. I always think that it is a historical miracle that people of one country can be so close to people of another country. Regarding this factor, I think you will not underestimate it, this is another decisive factor in annihilating the enemy and winning! ... That's my opinion." When our conversation ended, a serious and powerful voice shouted outside the door:
    "Report!"
    The regimental commander straightened his body and said, "Come in."
    The tarpaulin was lifted and the messenger brought in two letters. The regimental commander immediately opened them, and as he looked at them, he couldn't help smiling to himself, "Two more! Two more!"
    "What?" I asked.
    "Requests to take on the main offensive mission in the next battle."
    Having said that, he put the request on the desk.
    Spring has come, and everywhere on the commanders' desks are filled with such requests. These are requests longing for larger-scale battles, these are requests longing for greater victories, these are spring requests. Go to the companies and see, the soldiers are as busy as swallows: sharpening bayonets, wiping new captured guns, mending torn clothes, climbing on the window to write new meritorious service plans, sitting alone on the hillside to write applications and volunteer forms for joining the Party and the League, ... everything shows that the spring full of vitality has come to the front line of the struggle between light and darkness throughout the world. This spring will surely be a spring of jubilation for the people of our motherland and the Korean people; and for the enemy, it is a terrible spring. Because we have had a bountiful winter, how can we not have a glorious spring!

### 冬天和春天

　　冬天和春天
    魏巍
    饱含生机的春天，已经来到全世界光明与黑暗斗争着的朝鲜前线了。在这个季节之前，中朝人民部队经历了整整一个冬季的并肩作战，把世界人民最大、最后的一个垂死的强敌——美帝国主义打败了，戳穿了“纸老虎”的虎皮，击破美帝国主义不可战胜的神话；但对人民来说，这一段艰苦的、而又胜利的路程，只不过是一个迎接更大胜利的准备：这是一个丰收的冬季，孕育着更加伟大的、辉煌的春天。
    下面，让我用一位指挥员的谈话来说明罢。
    那是在一个晚上，我和一位团指挥员坐在一间小屋里。从窗户里吹进来的风，温酥酥的，满有春天的味道，我们就纵谈起来。
    “你问我部队在冬季作战的收获吗？那，真是蛮丰富的。”他兴奋地说，接着，指了指墙上挂着的电发卡宾枪说：“首先，就拿最明显的来说吧。这新式的卡宾枪，是美国人在这次朝鲜战争里才开始使用的，可是，当他们和我们接触的那一天起，就源源不断地交到我们手里。从敌人手里缴获的炮，现在已经和我们的炮排在一起。我觉得我们能拿这些东西回手来打敌人，你想，我们今后作战的火力，不会加强些吗！”
    “其次，我觉得很可珍贵的是，我们在和近代化装备的敌人作战中，丰富了自己，提高了自己。”他似乎很想强调这一点：“也许，在我个人讲来，更觉得突出些。在几个团的干部讲来，我是最年青的一个。因此，这几个月里，我的脑子简直没有真正休息过，我完全沉浸在实战学习里面。现在，我感觉到自己是提高了，所得的东西，也许比上几年军事学校还要多些，还更加属于我自己。在指挥上，我一次比一次觉得更有把握些。这个收获的可贵，也许一般人体会不到，可是在一个指挥员说来，是比农民看见满囤满仓的粮食还欢喜哩。”说到这里，他忽然用爽朗的声音笑着说：“你说怪不怪呢，这几次战役是这么巧，好象有意地在各方面锻炼我们一下：第一、二次战役——锻炼了我们的运动歼敌，第三次战役，锻炼了攻坚，第四次战役又来了一个阻击。过去，我们战术上的优越性已经使敌人惊讶了，今后，我们还会使敌人更加惊讶的。”
    说到这里，他似乎非常兴奋，脸上放出一种奇异的笑容。这种笑容，是只有指挥员在战斗胜利结束的时候才有的。他接着说：
    “在收获中有一种有形的东西，比如刚才说的卡宾枪、榴弹炮，这是可以看到的；还有一种你在表面上不容易看到的东西，无形的东西，这就是人的思想和意志。可是你决不要轻视这种无形的东西，当炮声响起来以后，你就可以看到这种东西的力量是惊人的。这是决定战争胜负的主要因素之一。这次出国作战，我感到我们部队的每一个人都读了两个重要的‘课本’。一个是‘决心课本’，一个是‘信心课本’。一过江，同志们先读了一个‘决心课本’，这个课本，是美国侵略者用他们的炸弹、燃烧弹和朝鲜老百姓的鲜血写成的。当我们渡过鸭绿江以后，看到满地瓦砾、遍地被残杀者的时候，每一个人不但认识了美帝国主义者的面目，而且认识了他的骨头是用什么做成的。一提起美帝国主义，大家痛恨得眼珠子都变成了红的。我们认识了朝鲜人民今天的境遇，也认识了祖国所受的威胁。我们更加热爱自己的祖国和受苦受难的朝鲜。这个‘课本’，使我们愿意粉身碎骨，只要能消灭侵略者。另外，经过这四次战役，在上面的决心支持下我们一直成为战胜者。在这里面就有一个‘信心课本’，这个‘信心课本’上说：‘美国侵略者及其帮凶是完全可以被打败的，尽管敌人装备精良保有海空优势，也仍然是可以被打败的。’这两个‘课本’，不是用墨水写成的，而是用血写成的。我们在过去的条件下，就已经战胜了优势装备的敌人，随着今后装备改进，战术技术的继续提高，必定能创造未来的更大胜利，把美国侵略军及其帮凶军埋葬在朝鲜半岛上！”
    当他说完这段话的时候，显得很严肃，停了好几分钟之久。
    “我觉得，在我们方面还有一点收获。”他说：“这就是中朝人民的友谊越来越亲密，越深厚，越团结。这种团结已经不是用普通名词所能形容的了，已经不是用任何力量所可以分开的了。我总想，一个国度同另一个国度的人，竟能这样的亲密，真是历史上的奇迹。关于这个因素，我想你不会轻视，这是另一个歼敌致胜的决定因素哩！……我的见解就是这样。”当我们谈话结束的时候，门外有一个严肃而有力的声音喊道：
    “报告！”
    团指挥员把身子正了正说：“进来。”
    雨布掀开，通讯员送进来两封信。团指挥员马上拆开，看着看着，不由自言自语地微笑起来：“又是两份！又是两份！”
    “什么？”我问。
    “要求下次战役担任主攻任务的请求书。”
    说过，他把请求书搁在桌案上。
    春天来了，到处指挥员的桌案上，摆满了这样的请求书。这是渴望着更大规模战斗的请求书，这是渴望着更大胜利的请求书，这是春天的请求书。你到各连去看吧，战士们都象燕子一般地繁忙着：磨刺刀呀，擦新缴获的枪呀，补磨破的衣服呀，爬在窗口写新的立功计划呀，独自个儿坐在山坡上写入党、入团的申请书、志愿书呀，……一切都说明：饱含生机的春天，已经来到这个全世界光明与黑暗斗争的前线了。这个春天，必将是我们祖国人民、朝鲜人民欢腾呼喊的春天；而对敌人来说，则是一个可怕的春天。因为我们有了丰收的冬季，难道还没有辉煌的春天吗！
