　　Yao people in Jianghua, Yongming, Ningyuan, Daoxian, Dong'an, and other counties in southern Hunan Province have held representative meetings. At these meetings, the counties focused on discussing the popularization and in-depth development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and the specific tasks carried out in coordination with this movement.

　　About 100,000 Yao people in southern Hunan Province live in the mountains of Jianghua and other areas. They used to live very hard lives, and many Yao people had never left the mountains in their entire lives. Since last winter, the local people's government has combined various tasks to carry out current affairs education on Resist America, Aid Korea among the people. According to incomplete statistics: more than 300 accusation meetings and forums have been held in Yao areas, and more than 30 demonstrations against the United States arming Japan have been held. The people's governments of various counties and districts also generally convened Yao people's representative meetings, and reporters from each county gave reports on Resist America, Aid Korea at the meetings. The representatives at the meetings used methods such as recalling the past and complaining about their suffering to accuse the crimes of the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents. They unanimously realized that without resisting America and aiding Korea, they could not live a good life. They also told the Resist America, Aid Korea branches in various counties that they would actively carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement after returning to their hometowns, distribute the propaganda materials they brought back to each Yao family, and strive for everyone to sign the declaration on supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty. After overfulfilling the afforestation task, the Yao people in the fifth district of Jianghua County organized more than 240 forest protection groups and formulated forest protection covenants. The representative of Yuankou Township in Yongming County guaranteed that the land cultivated for the families of soldiers in the township this year would exceed the normal yield by 25 percent.

　　湖南南部徭族人民参加抗美援朝行列
    湖南省南部江华、永明、宁远、道县、东安等县已分别举行徭族人民代表会议。在这些会议上，各县曾着重讨论了普及和深入开展抗美援朝运动，以及配合这一运动所进行的各项具体工作。
    湖南省南部约有十万徭族人民聚居在江华等地区的山峦中。他们过去生活很苦，有许多徭民一辈子也没出过山。去冬以来，该地区人民政府曾结合各项工作在人民群众中进行了抗美援朝的时事教育。据不完全统计：先后在徭民地区举行的控诉会和座谈会有三百多次，反对美国武装日本的游行示威三十多次。各县、区人民政府还普遍召开了徭族人民代表会议，各县报告员并在会议上作了关于抗美援朝的报告。各县与会代表运用回忆、诉苦等方式控诉了美蒋特务的罪行。他们一致认识到：不抗美援朝，就不能过好日子。他们并向各县的抗美援朝分会表示，返乡后保证积极开展抗美援朝运动，把带回去的宣传品分发给各家徭民，争取每个人都在关于拥护缔结和平公约的宣言上签名。江华县五区徭民在超额完成造林任务后，曾组织了二百四十多个护林小组，订立了护林公约。永明县渊口乡的代表，保证今年为该乡军人家属代耕的土地，要超过常年产量的百分之二十五。
