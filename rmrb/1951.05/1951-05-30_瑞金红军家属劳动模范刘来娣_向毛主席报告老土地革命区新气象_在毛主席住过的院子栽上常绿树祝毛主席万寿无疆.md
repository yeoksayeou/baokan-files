Respected Chairman Mao:

I am a revolutionary military family member from Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, the location of the Central People's Government during the Land Revolution era. I am now reporting to you on the changes that have taken place in Ruijin County since the people were liberated.

Recently, what makes everyone most happy is that many of those counter-revolutionaries who killed revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people and who are guilty of bloody crimes have been caught and executed by us.

Chairman Mao! The people of Ruijin have held these blood debts in our hearts for many years. Since our Red Army main force went north to fight against the Japanese, some evil landlords, in collusion with the Kuomintang reactionaries, carried out a bloody massacre of the people. More than 12,000 revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people were killed throughout the county. However, we were not intimidated. We firmly remembered your words: "The Red Army will return!" Our revolutionary guerrillas have been persistent in their struggle. We have finally waited for this day. Those executioners who killed the people have finally received the punishment of the people. Xie Yiquan, one of the notorious "Three and a Half Knives" and a murderous demon, Liu Kebao, the murderer who destroyed the Red Army Memorial Tower and killed many revolutionary cadres, Zhu Dezhou and Lai Zhiya, Kuomintang secret agents who undermined the local CCP organizations at that time, and Chen Shugao, the traitor who betrayed our two revolutionary guerrilla teams, all these counter-revolutionaries deserved to die and have now been executed by the government.

Another thing that everyone is happy about is that, after bandit suppression, anti-hegemony and rent reduction, two-thirds of Ruijin County has now implemented land reform. During the rent reduction last year, farmers throughout the county received a total of more than 20,000 dan of grain. In the land reform, the total value of the fruits of their blood and sweat, which had been exploited by the landlord class, amounting to 4.8 billion yuan, has been recovered.

The farmers are rejoicing and engaging in production after getting these gains. Under the leadership of the People's Government, this year, more than 1,100 new and repaired water conservancy projects, large and small, have been built throughout the county, which can guarantee water for one-third of the county's cultivated land (100,000 mu). We all still remember what you told us twenty years ago: "Ruijin is really good, plowing the fields three times." All farmer representatives in the county are determined to follow your words and plow the fields three times, harrow them four times, and weed them three times, and strive to increase grain production by 90,000 shi for the county.

Respected Chairman Mao, I know that if we poor people want to turn over, we must fight a decisive battle with the enemy. I feel honored to be a revolutionary military family member. My husband joined the Red Army and has not been heard from for many years. It is very likely that he has gloriously sacrificed for the revolution. I also sent my two sons to join the People's Liberation Army. My eldest son in the Third Field Army performed great service in fighting the enemy. My second son is in the local army and is also very promising. I myself work hard in production and was elected as a provincial agricultural labor model last year. The Central South Military and Political Committee also awarded me a large cow. Now the people of the county are increasing their strength to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions to increase production. I have also made a patriotic production plan: I will not have anyone cultivate the land for me, but I will cultivate 22 dan of land well by myself, and ensure that the five farmers in the mutual aid group complete the plan to increase production by 10%.

Respected Chairman Mao: We are always thinking of you. Recently, we are renovating the place where you lived and the offices of the various departments and offices of the Central People's Government during the Land Revolution era. In the courtyard where you lived, we planted evergreen trees, expressing our wishes for your longevity.

Revolutionary Military Family Member of Ruijin County, Jiangxi  Liu Laidi

　　瑞金红军家属劳动模范刘来娣
    向毛主席报告老土地革命区新气象
    在毛主席住过的院子栽上常绿树祝毛主席万寿无疆敬爱的毛主席：
    我是土地革命时代中央人民政府所在地——江西省瑞金县一个革命军人家属，现在向您报告一些瑞金县人民翻身的情形。
    近些天，大伙心里最痛快的是，过去那些杀害革命干部和革命人民、血债累累的反革命分子，有好多已经被咱们捉住杀掉了。
    毛主席！这些血海深仇，咱们瑞金人民压在心里已经好多年了。自从咱们的红军主力北上抗日以后，一些万恶的地主们结合着国民党反动派向人民进行血腥大屠杀，全县有一万二千多革命干部和革命人民遭杀害。但是，我们并没有被吓倒，我们牢牢记着您说的这句话：“红军会回来的！”我们革命的游击队一直在坚持斗争。我们终于等到了这一天，那些杀害人民的刽子手，终于得到了人民的惩罚，绰号“三把半刀”之一的杀人魔王谢益湶，拆毁红军纪念塔并杀害很多革命干部的凶手刘克宝，破坏当时当地中共党组织的国民党特务朱德周、赖枝雅，出卖我们两支革命游击队的叛徒陈书诰，这些都是死有余辜的反革命分子，现在已由政府把他们枪决了。
    另一件大家高兴的事是，咱们瑞金经过剿匪、反恶霸和减租，现在全县三分之二的地区已经实行了土地改革。在去年减租时，全县农民共得到两万多担谷子。在土地改革中，已收回被地主阶级剥削去的血汗果实总值四十八亿元。
    农民们得到这些果实，都在欢天喜地闹生产。在人民政府领导下，今年全县新修与补修的水利工程，大小有一千一百多处，可以保证全县三分之一的耕地（十万亩）用水。我们都还记得在二十年前您给我们说的话：“瑞金真正好，犁田犁三道。”全县农民代表都决心遵照您的话，耕田要作到三犁、四耙、三耘，要为全县增产九万石粮食而斗争。
    敬爱的毛主席，我知道，咱们穷人要翻身，必须和敌人作决死的斗争。我自己能作一个革命军人家属，感到很光荣。我丈夫参加红军，多年没有音信，很可能已为革命光荣牺牲了。我又叫我的两个儿子参加了人民解放军。在第三野战军的大儿子，曾在和敌人作战中立了大功。二儿子在地方部队，也很有骨气。我自己努力劳动生产，去年当选为全省农业劳动模范，中南军政委员会还奖给我一头大牛。现在全县人民都在以增加生产的实际行动来增加抗美援朝的力量。我也订了爱国生产计划：不要人代耕，自己要把二十二担田种好，并保证互助组内的五户农民，完成增产百分之十的计划。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们时时想念着您，最近我们正在修整您住过的地方和土地革命时代的中央人民政府各部、厅办公的地方。在您住过的院子里，我们栽上了长绿树木，表示我们祝贺您万寿无疆。
