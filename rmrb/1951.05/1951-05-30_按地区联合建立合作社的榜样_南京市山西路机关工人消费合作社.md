A Model for Establishing Cooperatives Jointly by Region
    ——Nanjing Shanxi Road Government Employees' Consumer Cooperative
    Fu Naichao
    The experience of the Nanjing Shanxi Road Government Employees' Consumer Cooperative in establishing the cooperative demonstrates that the method of organizing cooperatives jointly by region can concentrate funds, expand business, save cadres, reduce expenses, and achieve rational management, while also facilitating members, solving the difficulties of establishing cooperatives in small government organizations and groups, and enabling cooperatives to truly meet the needs of members. This method is suitable for the current urban situation and meets the requirements of the masses.

  Before Joint Establishment
    Within a radius of about one li around Shanxi Road in Nanjing, there is a dense area of ​​more than a dozen small government organizations. In the past, although the staff and workers actively requested to organize cooperatives, they did not have the conditions to organize separately due to the small size and few people in the organizations. The three cooperatives that had been established could not be consolidated and developed for the same reasons. For example, the Consumer Cooperative of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters' staff had 405 members and 600 real unit funds, and operated three stores; although it solved some of the needs of the members, it was difficult to persist in work and fulfill various systems because all the cadres in the cooperative were part-time employees. The Coal Ball Factory Workers' Consumer Cooperative had only 15 members and very little funds, with a turnover once every five months. For example, in October of last year, the turnover was only 900,000 yuan, and the annual loss was 250,000 yuan. Adding the taxes payable, even if all the shares were compensated, it would not be enough to maintain operations. The Fifth District Citizens' Consumer Cooperative had 487 members, more than half of whom were government employees, and the residential areas were very scattered. The 3.6 million yuan in funds could not fully supply the needs of the members. The 10 cadres in the cooperative relied on a large amount of non-member transactions to maintain their livelihoods. For example, in October of last year, transactions with non-members accounted for 52 percent.

    In view of this situation, the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters, based on the principle of "easy access to members and rational management," piloted a government employees' consumer cooperative organized jointly by region in Shanxi Road.

            After Joint Establishment

    The Shanxi Road Government Employees' Consumer Cooperative was formally established in early December last year, with the Consumer Cooperative of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters' staff as the main body, uniting 14 nearby units. By March of this year, it had presented a new look in terms of organization and business.

    The jointly established cooperative implemented democratic management, convened four meetings of the Board of Directors and Supervisors monthly in accordance with the cooperative's articles of association, and convened two meetings of members' representatives quarterly. Therefore, members of each unit were able to regularly supervise and manage their own cooperative, so that it could serve to meet the needs of the members. In this way, the cooperative's business rapidly expanded. The average monthly transaction volume before the joint organization totaled 35.97 million yuan, increasing to 75.28 million yuan after the merger. The average monthly transaction volume for each member increased from 35,900 yuan before the merger to 51,960 yuan. The cooperative also handled bathing and haircut tickets for members, with an average price 500 yuan lower than the market price. The internal expense rate of the cooperative was reduced to 3.25 percent, a decrease of 0.7 percent compared with before the merger. Therefore, it was able to supply consumer goods to members at low prices. Within four months, members suffered 26 million yuan less in intermediate exploitation in total, and obtained a net profit of 9.88 million yuan, which was used to develop business. During the same period, the number of members increased from 997 to 1,641, an increase of more than 60 percent. The number of cadres in the cooperative decreased from 12 to 6. Previously, an average of one person served 83 members, and now an average of one person serves 273 members.

    Now, the cooperative's buying and selling is constant all day long, and there are often ten or so tricycles waiting at the door to pull goods. Staff and workers from units such as the Hygiene Clinic, the Yongli Ammonium Factory Office, and the Electrical Engineering Building of the Municipal Party Committee, who have not yet joined the cooperative, have recently requested to join one after another. The cooperative has become an economic organization that is loved by the vast number of members and is closely related to the daily life of the masses.

            How to Solve Problems in the Joint Process

    The cooperative was able to be formed smoothly because careful preparations were made in advance. In October of last year (two months before the official establishment of the cooperative), a symposium of representatives from various units was held with the Consumer Cooperative of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters' staff, a larger unit, as the core. A preparatory committee was organized under the principle of voluntary participation, and consultations were held with each other to eliminate the concerns of members and cadres, and the following issues were properly resolved:

    1. The issue of cadres in the original cooperatives. For example, the Fifth District Citizens' Consumer Cooperative had many original cadres, who were afraid of losing their jobs after the merger, so they obstructed the joint establishment of the cooperative among the members. After discussion and consultation, it was decided to retain two people with strong working abilities, and the rest were assigned to other jobs. After properly resolving the issue of cadres in the original cooperatives, all members of the cooperative automatically joined the new cooperative.

    2. The issue of the difference in shares in each cooperative before the joint organization. For example, members of the Consumer Cooperative of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters paid as much as ten real units, while the Coal Ball Factory Cooperative and the Fifth District Citizens' Cooperative paid one real unit. The former was too high, and most members could not afford to pay; the latter was too low, affecting business expansion. After repeated discussions by the preparatory committee, it was decided that salary-based personnel would pay four real units, and supply-based personnel and poor laborers would pay two real units. Original members who had already paid shares would be refunded the excess or made up the difference. From November, when new shares were absorbed, to early December, more than 90 percent of the staff and workers from units such as the Grain Bureau, the People's Court, and the Map Company had joined the cooperative.

    3. The members of each unit were afraid that there would be no one from their own unit working in the cooperative after the joint organization, and that the cooperative would not serve them well. The preparatory committee decided to appropriately allocate the number of representatives and members of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, so that even the smallest unit would have a representative, and two small units could produce one director or supervisor. In this way, the members' concerns were eliminated.

    4. The members were all afraid that the cooperative would be too far from their residences. The cooperative chose a more suitable new location, which everyone found convenient.

　　按地区联合建立合作社的榜样
    ——南京市山西路机关工人消费合作社
    傅乃超
    南京市山西路机关工人消费合作社的建社经验，证明按地区联合组织合作社的办法，既能集中资金、扩大业务、节省干部、缩减开支、实现合理经营，又可便利社员、解决小机关团体建社的困难，使合作社能真正满足社员的需要。这办法是适合当前城市情况与符合群众要求的。
  联合建社以前
    南京市山西路一里左右的范围以内，是十几个小机关的密布区域。过去职工们虽然都积极要求组织合作社，但都因为机关小、人数少，没有单独组织的条件。已建立的三个合作社，也由于以上原因，不能巩固、发展。如市合作总社工作人员的消费合作社，有四百零五名社员，资金六百个折实单位，又分三个门市部经营；虽解决了社员的一部分需要，但因社内干部全是职工兼职，难于坚持工作和履行各种制度。煤球厂工人消费合作社只十五个社员，资金很少，五个月周转一次，如去年十月份营业额只九十万元，全年亏了二十五万元，再加上应纳税款，连全部股金赔上还不足，无法维持。五区市民消费合作社四百八十七名社员，其中半数以上是机关社员，住区也很分散，三百六十多万元的资金，不能充分供应社员的需要，社内干部十人，依靠大量做非社员交易维持生活，如去年十月份中，对非社员的交易占百分之五十二。
    该市合作总社鉴于这种情况，以“便于接近社员及合理经营”为原则，在山西路试办了一个按地区联合组织起来的机关工人消费合作社。
            联合建社以后
    山西路机关工人消费合作社，以市合作总社工作人员的消费合作社为主，联合附近十四个单位，于去年十二月初正式建立。到今年三月，在组织和业务上都呈现出新的面貌。
    联合建立的合作社，实行了民主管理，遵照社章按月召开了四次理、监事会，按季召开两次社员代表大会。因此，各单位社员们得以经常监督和管理自己的合作社，使它为满足社员的需要而服务。这样，合作社的业务迅速扩大了。联合组织前平均每月交易额总计三千五百九十七万元，合并后增加到七千五百二十八万元。对每个社员每月的平均交易额，由联合前的三万五千九百元增加到五万一千九百六十元。合作社并为社员代办洗澡和理发票，平均每张低于市价五百元。社内各项费用率减至百分之三点二五，较联合前缩减了百分之零点七。因而能廉价供应社员消费品。四个月内，总计使社员少受中间剥削二千六百余万元，并获得纯利九百八十八万元，用于开展业务。同一期间，社员由九百九十七人发展到一千六百四十一人，增加百分之六十以上。社内干部则由十二人减为六人。以前平均每人为八十三个社员服务，现在平均每人为二百七十三个社员服务。
    现在，该社整天买卖不断，门口经常有十来辆三轮车等着拉货。未入社的卫生所、永利铔厂办事处、中共市委会电工楼等单位职工，最近都纷纷要求入社。该社已成为广大社员所热爱的与群众日常生活有密切联系的经济组织。
            如何解决联合过程中的问题
    该社所以能顺利组成，是由于事先做了周密的准备工作。去年十月（正式建社前两个月）即以较大单位市合作总社工作人员的消费合作社为核心，召开了各单位代表座谈会，在自愿参加的原则下组织筹备委员会，互相协商，消除了社员和干部的顾虑，妥善地解决了下列问题：
    一、原有各社干部问题。如五区市民消费合作社原有干部多，怕合并后自己失业，便在社员中阻挠联合建社。经讨论协商后，决定留用两名工作能力较强的，其余另行分配工作。适当解决了原有各社干部问题后，全社社员便自动参加了新社。
    二、联合组织前各社股金差额问题。如市合作总社的消费合作社社员多至十个折实单位，煤球厂合作社及五区市民合作社均为一个折实单位。前者太高，多数社员无力交纳；后者太低，影响业务扩大。经筹委会再三讨论，确定薪金制人员为四个折实单位，供给制人员及贫苦劳动者为两个折实单位。原有社员已交股金的，多退少补。自十一月吸收新股，到十二月初，粮食局、人民法院、地图社等单位已有百分之九十以上的职工入了社。
    三、各单位的社员怕联合组织后没有本单位的人在社里办事，合作社不能很好为自己服务。筹备委员会就决定适当地分配代表及理、监事名额，使最小的单位也有代表，两个小单位可以产生一名理事或监事。这样，社员们的顾虑便消除了。
    四、社员们都怕合作社离自己住处太远。合作社便选择了较适中的新社址，使大家都感方便。
