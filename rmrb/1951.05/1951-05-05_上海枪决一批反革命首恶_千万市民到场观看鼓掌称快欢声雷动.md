Shanghai Executes a Batch of Arch-Criminal Counter-Revolutionaries
　　Tens of Millions of Citizens Attend, Applaud, and Cheer Enthusiastically

　　[This newspaper reports] (本报讯)The Shanghai Military Control Commission, based on the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," has rendered verdicts on several counter-revolutionary cases cracked before April 15th, sentencing 285 extremely heinous imperialist running dogs and counter-revolutionary criminals to death. This batch of criminals was executed by firing squad at three execution grounds in Longhua, Dachang, and Jiangwan on the 30th. After the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau captured this batch of counter-revolutionary criminals before April 15th, the Municipal People's Procuratorate, in accordance with the demands of the broad masses of the people, thoroughly investigated their crimes. Then, the Municipal Military Control Commission filed a public prosecution. The Municipal Anti-Revolutionary Cases Review Committee deliberated for three consecutive days (25th, 26th, and 27th), unanimously advocating that this batch of arch-criminal counter-revolutionaries be sentenced to death. The Municipal Military Control Commission then swiftly pronounced and carried out the sentences.

　　Among the executed counter-revolutionary criminals, a number of them were arch-criminal elements who had committed evil deeds for more than ten years, killing countless people, raping countless women, robbing merchants and travelers, and sabotaging the workers' and students' movements. For example, the Kuomintang secret agent and bandit "Major General Commander" Feng Qizeng, a capable henchman of Dai Li, had killed more than 500 patriotic people, merchants, and fishermen in Shanghai, Chongqing, Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian, Zhoushan, and other places, including Chen Dayao and Chen Mo. He also robbed 17 merchant ships and grain ships. He also colluded with the American spy McKee, and under the instigation of American imperialism, went to Shanghai to carry out sabotage and lured ignorant youths to Taiwan for training by American spies. In July of last year, Feng, under the orders of the American-Chiang bandits, carried a number of American-style rifles and radios and sneaked back to the mainland, plotting a large-scale massacre of patriotic people. Another example is Liu Baoshan, a secret agent of the Chiang bandit's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, who was a notorious thug. In 1947, he arrested Sun Jiao, Yu Tianshi, and 15 other staff members of Ding Xishan's department and subjected them to cruel torture. After liberation, he twice sneaked into the bandit-occupied areas, carrying a large number of firearms, landed on the coast of Pudong, and roamed around causing trouble.

　　Among the counter-revolutionary elements sentenced to death, a number of them were those whom the American-Chiang clique had arranged to be潜伏(qiánfú) in the city on the eve of Shanghai's liberation. For example, the bandit leader Li Guoliang, a follower of Chiang Ching-kuo, and Zhu Qilin, Zhou Wenhua, Yuan Zhongyi, and more than 60 other bandits of the Lu Jingshi faction, who were潜伏(qiánfú) in factories after liberation, secretly discussed organizing the "National Defense Ministry Youth Salvation Corps Anti-Communist Vanguard Team." They distributed counter-revolutionary leaflets, spread rumors, manufactured explosives, plotted assassinations, and prepared to sabotage the city-wide celebration of National Day on October 1st last year. Among them, Zhu Qilin had already infiltrated the Shanghai Wire Factory Trade Union picket team, and during the "October 1st" parade, he even attempted to sabotage the factory with weapons. Later, he also probed military and political intelligence and extorted money from people in the name of selling public bonds.

　　Among the executed counter-revolutionary criminals, there were also a number of leaders of reactionary secret societies. For example, the bandit "Emperor of Shunzhengguo" Zhang Shunbao colluded with traitors, spies, gangsters, and local bullies more than ten years ago to build "Yuxiangtang," spread heretical ideas to confuse the public, and fraudulently collected money, deceiving many people. Before liberation, he even systematically organized the "Shunzhengguo" special agent organization, plotting a large-scale armed rebellion after liberation.

　　In addition, a number of bullies潜伏(qiánfú) in the city's factories and neighborhoods, as well as landlords and bullies in the countryside, were also executed. For example, Chen Xiaomao, a Lu Jingshi faction special agent and bully at the Mifeng Worsted Mill, colluded with imperialists to extort entrance fees from the factory workers and embezzled them, and raped more than 100 female workers. After liberation, he continued to spread rumors, sabotage machines, and disrupt the trade union.

　　There was also a group of armed habitual bandits who had consistently roamed the seas or the mainland, killing and robbing, committing all kinds of evil. For example, the habitual bandit Wu Caigou, who roamed the seas, colluded with Chiang bandit agents in September of the year before last to rob a public grain ship of the Chuansha Hengsha District People's Relief Association in the waters of Yuanyuan Island, looting 400 bags of flour and abducting and killing Ye Xianwen, the director of the People's Relief Association. In February of last year, he carried a large number of weapons to Chongming and robbed the Chengling ship, looting the property of more than 600 passengers and killing two People's Liberation Army soldiers on board. Later, he robbed many times in the waters of Shengshan, Chuansha, Hengsha, and Yuanyuan Island.

　　When this batch of counter-revolutionary criminals was escorted to Longhua, Dachang, Jiangwan, and other suburbs of the city for execution on the 30th, tens of millions of citizens went to the scene to watch. They all applauded and cheered enthusiastically at the execution of this batch of heinous imperialist running dogs and counter-revolutionary criminals. They resolved to take further action to assist the People's Government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries and resisting America and aiding Korea!

　　上海枪决一批反革命首恶
    千万市民到场观看鼓掌称快欢声雷动
    【本报讯】上海市军事管制委员会，对于四月十五日以前破获的若干反革命案件，已依据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例予以判决，将其中二百八十五名罪大恶极的帝国主义走狗反革命罪犯判处死刑，并于三十日将这批罪犯分在龙华、大场、江湾三处刑场执行枪决。这一批反革命罪犯，经该市人民政府公安局在四月十五日以前捕获后，市人民检察署即根据广大人民的要求，周密调查其罪行，然后向该市军事管制委员会提起公诉，经该市反革命案件审查委员会连续三天（二十五、二十六、二十七）讨论，一致主张将这批反革命首恶判处死刑；该市军事管制委员会即迅速宣判执行。
    在枪决了的反革命罪犯中，有一批是作恶十余年，杀人累累，奸淫妇女无数，抢劫商旅，破坏工人运动与学生运动的反革命首恶分子。其中如军统特务匪“少将司令”封企曾，为戴笠的得力爪牙，曾在上海、重庆、松江、金山、奉贤、舟山等地杀害陈大瑶、陈默等爱国人士与商民、渔民五百多人，抢劫商船粮船十七艘，又与美国特务麦琪勾结，受美帝国主义指使，到上海进行破坏，并诱骗无知青年至台湾受美国特务训练。去年七月，封匪受美蒋匪命，携带美式长短枪多支及电台等潜返大陆，阴谋大规模屠杀爱国人民。又如蒋匪保密局特务刘葆珊，为著名打手；他在一九四七年曾逮捕丁锡山部工作人员孙蛟、虞天石等十七人，施以酷刑。解放后，两度潜往匪占区，携带大批枪械在浦东沿海登陆，流窜滋扰。
    在被处死刑的反革命分子中，又有一批是该市解放前夕，为美蒋布置潜伏在该市的。象匪首蒋经国系特务李国梁、解放后即与其他潜伏在工厂中的陆京士系特务朱其林、周文华、袁中一等六十余匪徒密议组织“国防部青年救国团反共先锋队”。散发反革命传单，制造谣言，制造炸药，阴谋暗杀，并准备在去年十月一日破坏全市人民庆祝国庆的大游行。其中朱其林，早已混入上海电线厂工会纠察队，在“十·一”游行时，竟想持械破坏该厂，后又刺探军政情报，以推销公债名义向人勒索。
    在枪决的一批反革命罪犯中，还有一批是反动会道门的头子。如匪“顺政国皇帝”张顺宝，十多年前，即与汉奸、特务、流氓、恶霸相勾结，修建“遇仙堂”，妖言惑众，诈敛钱财，很多人受他欺骗。解放前，更有计划地组织“顺政国”特务组织，阴谋在解放以后，组织大规模武装叛乱。
    此外，其中还有一批潜伏在该市工厂、里弄中的恶霸和乡村中的地主恶霸，也予以处决。如密丰绒线厂陆京士系特务恶霸陈小毛，曾与帝国主义勾结，勒索该厂工人进厂费中饱，强奸女工一百多。解放后仍散布谣言，破坏机器，捣乱工会。
    还有一批是一贯横行海上或大陆，杀人越货，无恶不作的武装惯匪。如横行海上的惯匪吴才狗，前年九月在元元沙岛海面与蒋匪特务共同抢劫川沙横沙区生救会公粮船一艘，劫去面粉四百包，并将生救会主任叶献文掳去杀害；去年二月携大批武器至崇明劫去城陵号轮船一只，将旅客六百余人财物劫光，将船上解放军两名杀害；后来又在嵊山、川沙、横沙、元元沙海面抢劫多次。
    这批反革命罪犯，于三十日押解至市郊龙华、大场、江湾等地枪决时，千万市民都到场观看，对这批罪大恶极的帝国主义走狗、反革命罪犯的伏法，无不鼓掌称快，欢声雷动。决心进一步行动起来，协助人民政府坚决镇压反革命，抗美援朝！
