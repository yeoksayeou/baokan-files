    Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai held an enlarged joint meeting of representatives from all circles of the city and districts at Yiyuan on the afternoon of April 29th, for the public trial of nine counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes. More than 10,000 people attended, including representatives from all circles in the city and districts, as well as representatives from various people's organizations, factories, schools, neighborhood residents, government agencies, and military units. Shanghai and East China People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the meeting live to the city and East China, and masses were widely organized to listen in. The number of listeners in Shanghai reached 2,828,000; in Nanjing, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, and other cities, the number of listeners was over 800,000. The meeting received 4,664 phone calls and 5,816 letters from people in various places accusing and reporting counter-revolutionary elements. In addition, 1,739 units, totaling approximately 637,800 people, conducted voting while listening to the live broadcast of the meeting, unanimously demanding the execution of the nine criminals on public trial.
    The meeting listened to reports from Vice Mayor of Shanghai, Pan Hannian, and Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Yang Fan, on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In his report, Vice Mayor Pan Hannian pointed out: The arrest of a group of counter-revolutionary elements on April 27th was based on the demands of the broad masses of people and the implementation of the resolution of the Second Session of the Second Shanghai People's Representative Conference. The purpose of holding this meeting today is to let the broad masses of people deeply recognize the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements, so as to assist the government in doing a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He said: Shanghai has been liberated for two years, and there has been progress in all aspects of work. However, does this mean that counter-revolutionary forces have ceased to exist? (The audience shouted: "No!") Have the hostility and sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements against the people's cause stopped? (The audience shouted: "No!") Facts prove that there are still a large number of counter-revolutionary elements lurking in Shanghai to carry out sabotage. They are very rampant and their methods are very vicious. Now, according to the demands of the people, we have arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements, allowing the people to hold their heads high and striking fear into the hearts of imperialists and counter-revolutionary elements! (The whole audience applauded enthusiastically, shouting: "Long live the People's Government! Long live the Communist Party!") Vice Mayor Pan continued to point out: For these counter-revolutionary elements, we must deal with them separately in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government and the decision of the East China Military and Political Committee to implement the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." Those who deserve to be killed should be killed, those who deserve to be imprisoned should be imprisoned, and those who deserve to be put under surveillance should be put under surveillance! (The audience applauded enthusiastically, shouting: "Right!") We must resolutely correct the past mistake of "boundless leniency." All those who have committed heinous crimes, are hated by the people, and deserve to be killed, no matter how many there are, should be resolutely brought to justice. At the same time, we must resolutely ensure that we do not wrongly kill a single person! (The audience applauded enthusiastically, shouting: "The government never wrongly kills a single person, and we must not let go of any counter-revolutionary element!") Finally, Vice Mayor Pan said firmly: We have the determination and the strength to thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism and its running dogs, the counter-revolutionaries. Today, there is only one path before the counter-revolutionary elements: surrender or perish! (The whole audience shouted: "Suppress the counter-revolutionaries!")
    Director Yang Fan then gave a report. He listed a group of counter-revolutionary elements arrested on April 27th, including spies directly or indirectly instructed by imperialism, agents of various systems of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, bandit leaders and despots, reactionary secret societies, and other types of criminals. They continued to do evil after liberation and were heavily stained with blood debts.
    Deputy Chief Procurator of the Shanghai People's Procuratorate, Fang Xing, announced the list of counter-revolutionary elements on trial. They were: Feng Qizeng, an important agent of the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique who murdered more than 500 patriotic people; Liu Baoshan, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Songhu People's Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian Self-Defense Army"; Xu Songjian, a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Bureau of Secrecy" who directed US-Chiang Kai-shek aircraft to bomb targets; Lu Xingsheng, a habitual bandit and special agent who killed more than a thousand people and fried and ate human hearts; Chen Xiaomao, a local tyrant and special agent who raped more than a hundred female workers; Zhang Shunbao, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent and self-proclaimed "Emperor of Shunzheng State" who colluded with bandits to prepare for riots; Zhou Xiaobin, a big bandit who killed New Fourth Army cadres and more than 60 farmers; as well as US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and murderers Fang Qingzhong and Ren Zongbing. Deputy Chief Procurator Fang Xing announced the charges one by one and filed a public prosecution. When each criminal was escorted to the center of the venue, the representatives present glared with hatred and shouted, "Kneel down!" The whole audience shouted: "Shoot him!"
    The victims who had been harmed by these heinous counter-revolutionary elements took to the stage one after another to make tearful accusations. The peasant woman Zhou Gaodi, on behalf of the people of Zhenru and the surrounding areas in the suburbs of Shanghai, accused the bandit Zhou Xiaobin of his murderous crimes. She shouted in tears, "Kill him!" The female worker Liu Xiuying accused the bandit Chen Xiaomao of raping her and more than a hundred female workers. Liu Xiuying was unable to speak clearly while making her accusation. The audience shouted, "Shoot Chen Xiaomao, avenge our sisters!" Tang Zhenchang, a former staff member of the Shanghai progressive publication "Wen Cui," accused the bandit Ren Zongbing of murdering Chen Zitao, Wu Chengde, Luo Hemin, and other editors of "Wen Cui." The families of the martyrs stood at the front of the stage. After recounting the arrest and murder of the martyrs, Tang Zhenchang said: The martyrs died, for whom? (The audience shouted: "For us! For our next generation!") If we do not severely suppress the counter-revolutionary elements, how can we be worthy of the martyrs? (The audience shouted: "We are unworthy, we must resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionaries and avenge the martyrs!") Can we be "benevolent" to the counter-revolutionary elements? (The audience shouted resolutely: "No! Shoot them!") All the representatives unanimously demanded that these murderers be shot, to avenge the people and to avenge the revolutionary martyrs.
    After the public trial, Deputy Chief Procurator Fang Xing immediately announced: Accepting the opinions of people from all walks of life, the nine criminals will be submitted to the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Shanghai People's Court for sentencing to death. As soon as Deputy Chief Procurator Fang announced this, a burst of applause and cheers erupted in the audience.
    In the enthusiastic atmosphere, representatives from all walks of life, including Zhuang Zonghan, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Renbing, Chen Guobin, Rong Yiren, Qiu Huiying, Zhang Jinyi, Ma Yifang, and Wang Yunsheng, took to the stage one after another to express their opinions in support of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    Finally, the meeting passed a resolution: To quickly establish committees for eliminating counter-revolutionaries in all grass-roots units throughout the city; and to call on the people of the city to unite and strive for the great victory of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
