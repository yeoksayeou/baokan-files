Overcome Pests and Diseases, Strive for a National Bumper Harvest

In 1950, pest and disease control in agricultural production played a significant role in ensuring a national bumper harvest. Pest and disease prevention work was carried out on over 100 million mu of cultivated land across the country, reducing crop losses estimated at 1.6877 billion jin of grain. This achievement was mainly due to the implementation of the principle of "prevention over treatment," widely mobilizing and organizing the masses of peasants to carry out timely prevention and control. Especially in pest control, some areas implemented the methods of "early attack," "attack when few," and "thorough attack" (i.e., completely eliminating pests while they are small or when the infestation has just begun and is not yet severe), achieving significant results. However, in 1950, we did not completely overcome pests and diseases; we only managed to reduce losses, far from achieving zero losses. According to estimates from the North China region alone, crop reduction due to pests and diseases reached 2.8 billion jin of grain last year. This figure tells us that we must continue to be vigilant and, on the basis of 1950, carry out the pest and disease control movement more deeply and universally to ensure the completion of this year's production increase tasks. Spring sowing has now begun successively, and soil locusts, red spiders, wireworms, wheat blossom midges, etc., have been found in many winter wheat areas. All of this urgently requires us to strengthen our attention to this aspect and actively carry out pest and disease control work. Based on last year's experience, the following suggestions are offered for reference in various regions.

(1) Prepare pesticides and equipment, and develop domestically produced pesticides. The occurrence and spread of pests and diseases are very rapid. If prevention preparations are insufficient, one will be caught off guard once they occur. Therefore, helping the masses of peasants prepare for prevention and control is extremely important. Cotton-producing areas should prepare a large quantity of tobacco, cottonseed oil, soap, lime, sulfur, etc., to eliminate cotton aphids and red spiders that have occurred continuously over the years. Areas with severe underground pests should prepare red arsenic, white arsenic, and sodium fluorosilicate as much as possible. Fruit and vegetable areas should focus on using pesticides and equipment to carry out demonstration and promotion. Areas affected by rice stem borers and locusts should prepare simple catching tools. These areas should immediately and carefully check the pesticide preparation situation and prepare sufficient pesticides and catching equipment as soon as possible. Do not be negligent, lest you incur unnecessary losses.

Last year, more than 100,000 sprayers and dusters and more than 4.4 million jin of pesticides were sold to farmers across the country. These pesticides and equipment played a significant role in preventing and controlling pests and diseases. For example, the use of Ceresan and warm water soaking of wheat seeds in Chahar reduced the incidence of wheat smut to 0.5%. Farmers in Handan Prefecture, Hebei, used pesticides and equipment to control cotton aphids, ensuring a bumper harvest on more than 2 million mu of cotton fields. Therefore, their use should still be promoted as much as possible in areas with suitable conditions this year.

In terms of pesticide supply, we should establish a self-sufficiency, long-term construction mentality and vigorously develop domestically produced pesticides. In this regard, we not only have abundant resources, but also have successful experience in manufacturing agents. For example, pesticides such as copper sulfate, lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, copper sulfate, 666, sodium fluorosilicate, and mercury preparations, some have already begun trial production, and some have been mass-produced and applied. In addition, pyrethrum, derris, Tripterygium wilfordii, and bark of Melia azedarach are all native pesticides with great efficacy and promising development prospects. We should organize the masses to plant them in large quantities in suitable areas and try to improve the methods of processing and manufacturing.

(2) Train cadres to spread technology to the masses. To mobilize the broad masses of peasants to overcome pests and diseases, it is necessary to enable the masses of peasants to learn how to use scientific methods to eliminate pests and diseases. Experience has shown that this can only be fully achieved with sufficient technically proficient cadres who spread the technology to the masses. Last year and this spring, many places held training classes of various forms, training county, district, and village cadres and activists among the peasants. At the same time, labor model conferences, exhibitions, and appraisal meetings were held to deeply publicize and exchange technical experience. These methods are all very good. On the one hand, they cultivate a backbone for spreading technology, and on the other hand, they improve the technical level of the masses. However, our cadres still lack sufficient technical knowledge, and the technical level of the masses is still very poor. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen this work and use various methods to expand the ranks of technical personnel.

(3) Strengthen organizational leadership and establish a pest and disease intelligence system. The prevention and control of pests and diseases must be carried out as a mass prevention and control movement based on the conscious and voluntary participation of the masses. In order to carry out this movement victoriously, it is necessary to strengthen organizational and ideological leadership. When insect pests occurred last year, various places organized temporary institutions such as insect extermination headquarters and insect extermination committees to lead and plan to mobilize and organize the masses to launch an insect-catching upsurge and prevent and control various insect pests in a timely manner. (For example, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, launched an unprecedented rice stem borer control movement last year, reducing grain losses by 20%.) This measure should still be adopted this year. Establish insect extermination organizations at all levels in areas with severe insect pests, grasp the laws of insect pest occurrence, prepare for insect prevention, disseminate prevention and control technologies, overcome the masses' erroneous ideas of relying on heaven for food, superstition, paralysis, fear of trouble, and fear of delaying work, and organize the masses to carry out prevention and control in a timely manner.

Establishing a pest and disease intelligence system is also a very important measure. Quickly and accurately notifying the local pest and disease occurrence situation to higher-level leading organs and various regions will facilitate mutual coordination, prevent spread, and help carry out prevention and control work. This system should be established universally and conscientiously, starting from districts and villages.

(4) Strengthen experimental research work. At present, many types of pests and diseases still lack effective prevention and control methods, such as the widespread wheat yellow dwarf disease and wheat sucking midge, which caused considerable losses last year. In addition, there are some regional pests and diseases whose occurrence patterns and control methods have not yet been fully mastered. The prevention and control of these pests and diseases urgently needs to be strengthened to obtain effective prevention and control methods as soon as possible. Last year, many rust-resistant wheat varieties were discovered in various places, which is effective in preventing and controlling yellow rust. However, we cannot be satisfied with this. In addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to select and plant existing rust-resistant varieties, strengthening breeding research is also an extremely important task.

　　战胜病虫灾害，争取全国丰收
    一九五○年农业生产上的病虫害防治工作，在保证全国丰收中起了很大作用。全国各地曾在一亿余亩耕地上进行了病虫灾害的防除工作，减少作物损失，估计折粮达十六亿八千七百余万斤。这一成绩的获得，主要是贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，广泛动员和组织农民群众，及时地进行防治。特别是治虫方面，有些地区实行了“打小”、“打少”、“打了”的办法（即趁虫小或虫害刚刚发生而严重性不大时彻底消灭），收到很大成效。但是，在一九五○年，我们并未完全克服病虫灾害，我们只作到减少损失，还远未做到不受损失。仅就华北区估计，去年因病虫为害，减产粮食达二十八亿斤。这一数字告诉我们，必须继续提高警惕，在一九五○年的基础上，更深入更普遍地开展病虫防治运动，保证完成今年的增产任务。现在春田播种已陆续开始，而很多冬麦区已发现土蝗、红蜘蛛、金针虫、麦摇蚊等。这一切都急迫地要求我们加强对这一方面的注意，积极开展防治病虫害的工作。兹根据去年经验，提出下列几点意见，供各地参考。
    （一）作好药械准备，发展国产农药。病虫的发生和蔓延非常迅速，如防治准备不充分，一旦发生便会措手不及。因此，帮助农民群众作好防治准备是极端重要的。棉产区应准备大批烟草、棉油、肥皂、石灰、硫磺等，以消灭历年来连续发生的棉蚜和红蜘蛛。地下害虫严重地区，应尽可能地准备红砒、白砒和氟矽酸钠等。果树蔬菜区要有重点地利用药械，进行示范推广。稻螟虫和蝗虫为害地区，应准备好简单的捕打工具。这些地区应即认真检查农药准备的情况，及早准备足够的农药和捕打械具。万勿麻痹大意，以招致不应有的损失。
    去年全国各地贷卖给农民喷雾器、喷粉器等十余万架，病虫农药四百余万斤。这些药械在防治病虫中，发挥了很大作用。如察哈尔使用赛力散和温汤浸麦种，使黑穗病的发病率减至百分之零点五。河北邯郸专区农民使用药械防治棉蚜，保证了二百多万亩棉田丰收。因此今年仍应在有条件的地区尽量推广使用。
    在农药供应方面，我们应建立自给自足，长期建设的思想，大力发展国产农药。在这方面我们不但有丰富的宝藏，而且在制造药剂上也有成功的经验。如王铜、砒酸铅、砒酸钙、硫酸铜、六六六、氟矽酸钠及汞制剂等农药，有的已开始试制，有的已大量生产和应用。此外，除虫菊、鱼藤、雷公藤、苦树皮等都是药效很大，发展很有前途的土产农药，应在适宜地区组织群众大量种植，并尽量改进加工制造的办法。
    （二）训练干部，把技术传播到群众中去。要发动广大农民群众战胜病虫灾害，必须使农民群众学会运用科学的消灭病虫害的办法。经验证明，只有足够的掌握技术的干部，并通过他们把技术传布到群众中去，才能充分作到这一点。去年和今春很多地方举办了各种形式的训练班，训练了县区村干部和农民中的积极分子，同时并举行了劳动模范大会、展览会、评比会等，深入地宣传和交流了技术上的经验。这些方法都是很好的。一方面培养了传播技术的骨干，另一方面提高了群众的技术水平。但我们的干部的技术知识还很不够，群众的技术水平也还很差，因此，继续加强这一工作，用各种方法壮大技术人员的队伍，还是很必要的。
    （三）加强组织领导，建立病虫情报制度。防治病虫害，必须在群众自觉自愿的基础上开展群众性的防治运动。为了胜利地开展这一运动，加强组织领导和思想领导是非常必要的。去年虫害发生时，各地曾组织灭虫指挥部和灭虫委员会等临时性的机构，有领导有计划地发动和组织群众掀起捕虫热潮，适时地防治了各种虫害。（如浙江嘉兴去年掀起了规模空前的治螟运动，减少了二成粮食的损失。）今年仍应采取这种措施。在虫害严重地区建立各级灭虫指挥组织，掌握虫害发生规律，进行防虫准备，传播防治技术，打破群众靠天吃饭、迷信麻痹和怕麻烦、怕误工等错误思想，适时地组织群众进行防治。
    建立病虫情报制度，也是一个非常重要的措施。迅速地准确地把当地病虫发生情况通报上级领导机关和各地，这将便于互相策应，防止蔓延，有助于防治工作的开展。这一制度应从区村做起，普遍地认真地建立起来。
    （四）加强试验研究工作。目前有不少种病虫害还缺乏有效的防除方法，如带普遍性的小麦黄疸病、小麦吸浆虫等，去年曾造成了不小的损失。此外，还有一些带地域性的病虫害，其发生规律和防治办法也还没有完全掌握。这些病虫的防治亟待加强研究，早日获得有效的防治办法。去年各地发现很多抗锈病小麦品种，这对防除黄锈病是有效的。但是不能以此为满足，除继续发动群众选种现有抗锈品种外，加强育种研究也是一个极重要的任务。
