Report on National Cultural and Artistic Work in 1950 and Key Points of the 1951 Plan by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government
(Report by Deputy Minister Zhou Yang at the 81st Executive Meeting of the Government Administration Council on April 20, 1951, approved by the same meeting.)
I. Situation of National Cultural and Artistic Work in 1950

　　Over the past year, the general policy of national cultural and artistic work has been to popularize and enhance the new patriotic culture of the people, with popularization as the primary task. Under the principles of a united front between new and old in culture and of giving consideration to both public and private interests, we have on the one hand consolidated and developed new cultural and artistic undertakings, and on the other hand reformed the old cultural and artistic undertakings in a planned and focused manner; on the one hand consolidated and developed state-run cultural and artistic undertakings, and on the other hand led private-run cultural and artistic undertakings, and supported these undertakings with a focus, so that they are more planned and can achieve good coordination with state-run cultural and artistic undertakings. In the entire cultural and artistic work, we first selected those departments that are most needed for carrying out popularization work and have the greatest influence among the broad masses of people as the focus.

　　Now, let's review the main work of the past year based on the above policy.

(1) Film Industry

　　The film industry is the first key point in the entire cultural and artistic work, because film is the most powerful art form. According to statistics in 1950, the national annual film audience reached over 150 million people. The state-run film studios currently have three factories in Northeast China, Beijing, and Shanghai. In 1950, state-run factories produced a total of 26 feature films, one animated film, 16 educational short films and documentaries, 62 newsreels, and two color documentaries co-produced with the Soviet Union, translated 43 Soviet feature films, and translated 42 Soviet educational short films. The feature films and documentaries of state-run factories can generally faithfully reflect the lives and struggles of the Chinese people, especially workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some of them have reached a certain level in terms of ideology and art.

　　During the same period, private film studios produced a total of 34 feature films, most of which also maintained progressive ideological content and a serious creative attitude.

　　Due to the continuous production of progressive films by state-run and private factories, the large-scale translation of Soviet films, and the improvement of the audience's political level, within one year, the audience for progressive films in urban cinemas changed from a minority to a majority. By the end of 1950, the audience for progressive films accounted for approximately 65% to 70% of the total audience. In the film market, harmful films from imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States have been basically eliminated. Even in Shanghai, where American films had the greatest influence, American films have been abandoned by the broad audience over the past year, while domestic films with the theme of people's democratic struggle have been greatly welcomed; this is an unprecedented change in the film market and a huge victory on the cultural front.

　　In terms of film distribution, according to current statistics, there are 674 cinemas nationwide, including 342 publicly owned, 16 jointly owned by public and private entities, and 316 privately owned. The Film Bureau's directly affiliated film management companies have branches in major administrative regions to unify the national film distribution work. In cities with more cinemas, unified film scheduling methods have been adopted, striving for democratic consultation and consideration of both public and private interests. In order to enable people's films to reach rural areas, troops, mines, and factories, more than 1,800 projectionists were trained in 1950, and small-scale manual developing factories for 16mm copies used by projection teams were established. There were originally more than 100 projection teams nationwide, and after the projection machine orders are fulfilled, there will be more than 700 projection teams nationwide. In 1950, due to the shortage of film and limitations in developing equipment, state-run factories failed to supply sufficient copies to various regions and aspects in a timely manner, resulting in a serious phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the foundation of the film industry in the next few years to achieve self-sufficiency in equipment, and at the same time strengthen the training of film cadres to prepare the necessary conditions for the greater development of the film industry.

　　Today, film production, whether in quantity or quality, cannot fully meet the needs of the audience. Although some excellent feature films (such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "New Children's Heroes," etc.) and excellent documentaries have been produced by state-run factories, some works with weak ideological and artistic qualities, and even serious defects and errors in political ideology, and anti-realist styles in artistic style (such as "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?") have also been produced. Although we have provided different degrees of assistance to private film production companies in terms of economy based on different situations, our ideological guidance on their production is not enough. For example, Kunlun Company's "The Life of Wu Xun" is a film that makes incorrect representations of historical figures and historical traditions and is ideologically flawed. Therefore, strengthening the ideological leadership of national film production has become an extremely important task in the entire cultural and artistic work.

(2) Opera Reform Work

　　Old opera has a long tradition, with more than a thousand existing repertoires, nearly a hundred different types of opera, and approximately 300,000 opera performers nationwide. The audience for old opera is around one million people nationwide every day; old opera has such a close connection with the lives of the broad masses of people, so opera reform work is also one of the key points of cultural and artistic work.

　　Over the past year or so, opera reform work in various regions has achieved preliminary results; many new operas have been created, and some works have proven to be popular with the masses; this fact has greatly encouraged the confidence and courage of the vast number of performers to reform old opera. The reform of local opera is particularly active. Yue opera and Ping opera have achieved successful experience in expressing modern life. To make opera reform work widely carried out, it is necessary to obtain the conscious and voluntary efforts and cooperation of the vast number of performers. In 1950, more than 30,000 performers nationwide participated in learning. Through learning, their political awareness was raised, their unity and friendship were strengthened, and they initially gained the view of literature and art serving the people.

　　However, some deviations and shortcomings have also occurred in the opera reform work in various regions. This is manifested in two aspects: on the one hand, there is a lack of certain review standards and positive improvement plans for old opera, and simple prohibition methods are adopted, resulting in too many prohibited operas, which has caused difficulties in the lives of performers in some areas for a period of time, and also aroused dissatisfaction among the masses; on the other hand, some places have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards old opera, without actively leading it. In addition, although there have been some achievements in the modification and creation of opera, there are also many works that are anti-historical and formulaic. These works do not reflect historical truth from the perspective of historical materialism, but "modernize" historical figures and make inappropriate comparisons between historical events and the deeds of modern people's revolutionary struggle. The National Opera Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government in late November 1950 clearly stipulated that historical and patriotic viewpoints should be used as the criteria for reviewing repertoires; all important harmful content in old opera, and all barbaric, terrifying, cruel, obscene, and slavish elements in performance forms must be resolutely reformed; certain anti-historical and formulaic tendencies existing in the work of compiling and revising scripts must be corrected. The conference encouraged the free competition of various existing opera forms in China, and took the types of opera that have the greatest impact on the local masses as the main targets for reform and development. The conference also stipulated that in the future, opera reform work should be uniformly led by the local cultural and educational authorities. All operas that have a major harmful effect on the people and must be banned should be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government.

(3) Literary and Art Work Troupes and Mass Amateur Art Activities

　　Of great importance in popularization work are the literary and art work troupes spread throughout the country. Strengthening leadership over these troupes is also one of the key points of cultural and artistic work.

　　According to preliminary estimates, there are currently more than 200 literary and art work troupes (teams) nationwide, with approximately 20,000 professional drama and music cadres (the number of literary and art work troupes (teams) and literary and art work cadres in the troops far exceeds this number and is not included in the calculation).

　　The literary and art work troupe is one of the most important organizational forms of literary and artistic work and propaganda work, a bridge connecting popularization and enhancement, and a mobile school for training literary and art cadres. They went deep into rural areas, troops, and factories, performing "The White-Haired Girl," "Liu Hulan," "Red Flag Song," "Wang Xiuluan," and many propaganda plays that cooperated with current tasks, playing a significant role in mobilizing and educating the broad masses. They have long and arduously persisted in literary and artistic propaganda work among the masses, and they have contributed to the revolutionary cause.

　　In addition to comprehensive literary and art work troupes, professional drama troupes, opera troupes, song and dance troupes, dance troupes, music work troupes, and theaters mainly performing dramas or operas have also been established in the capital and large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin.

　　The national literary and art work troupes and drama troupes must be rectified and strengthened. First of all, the tasks and division of labor of literary and art work troupes and drama troupes at all levels should be clearly defined: literary and art work troupes and drama troupes in the central government, large administrative regions, and large cities should develop into theaters, focusing on the construction of theater art; literary and art work troupes and drama troupes in provinces and medium-sized cities should combine theater performances with touring performances; and literary and art work teams in special districts should focus on touring performances. Members of literary and art work troupes should be given opportunities to study and further their education to improve their professional skills.

　　Under the help and guidance of literary and art work troupes and literary and artistic workers, mass amateur art activities have greatly developed. Factories in major cities have almost all established their own amateur art organizations,展开ing drama, music, painting, and other literary and artistic activities. Workers have also demonstrated their wisdom and creativity in artistic creation. As for rural areas, the number of rural drama troupes in old and semi-old areas has greatly increased over the past year. Calculated by province, the number of village drama troupes ranges from nearly a thousand to four or five thousand. After land reform in the new areas, rural drama troupes have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain and are developing extremely rapidly. Mass amateur art activities must be closely integrated with production and must not violate the principles of being amateur, voluntary, and seasonal. Literary and art work troupes and other professional literary and artistic organizations must take on the responsibility of guiding mass amateur art activities.

(4) Serial Pictures and New Year Pictures

　　Developing new serial pictures and New Year pictures, and reforming old serial pictures and old New Year pictures, is the focus of art work.

　　At the end of 1949, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government issued instructions to开展 New Year picture work. In 1950, 26 regions across the country published New Year pictures. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 400 types, totaling more than 7 million copies. Some excellent works have already appeared in the New Year pictures. New Year pictures are actually a kind of propaganda painting.

　　Beijing, Shanghai, and other parts of the country have published more than 700 types of new serial pictures in the past year or so. Shanghai has always been the publishing center of serial pictures. There are more than 70 bookstores publishing serial pictures, and more than 3,000 book stalls selling and renting serial pictures. Over the years, more than 28 million copies of serial pictures have been published, most of which are martial arts and fantasy stories, and their harmful influence is very large. Most of the new serial pictures are also published in Shanghai. The new serial pictures have received attention and welcome from cadres and the masses. However, many of these works still have shortcomings in content and form, and therefore cannot satisfy the majority of readers.

　　In the work of reforming old New Year pictures and serial pictures, the painters and publishers of old New Year pictures and serial pictures have been united and educated. Many painters of old New Year pictures and old serial pictures enthusiastically participated in the work of drawing New Year pictures and new serial pictures. However, at present, some private publishing industries in Shanghai are still reprinting old content paintings and serial pictures. Old New Year pictures and old serial pictures still have a large market today. Strengthening and improving the publication of new serial pictures and New Year pictures is the most important task in art propaganda.

(5) Publication of Literary and Artistic Books

　　According to preliminary statistics, approximately 2,700 types of literary and artistic books, totaling more than 17 million copies, and more than 90 types of literary and artistic journals and supplements were published in 1950. In the publication of literary and artistic books, there is a state of laissez-faire without planning or leadership. Among the private publishing industries across the country, there are indeed many who are conscientious and responsible, but there are also publishers who are not conscientious or responsible, and the trend of shoddy work for the sake of profit is quite serious.

　　The state-owned People's Literature Publishing House was established in 1950. This publishing house will plan to publish modern and ancient Chinese literature, world classical and progressive literature, and implement correct division of labor and cooperation with public and private literary and artistic book publishing industries across the country, so that the entire literary and artistic book publishing industry will gradually move towards normal and sound development. In the entire publication of literary and artistic books, special attention should be paid to the publication of popular literary and artistic books and periodicals to meet the needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants.

(6) Art Education

　　The institutions for training art cadres directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government include the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Central Institute of Literature. In the major administrative regions, there are the Lu Xun Academy of Literature and Art in Northeast China, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music and the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in East China, the newly established Northwest People's Art Academy in Northwest China, the Literary and Art College of Zhongyuan University and the newly established South China People's Literature and Art College in Central and South China, and the newly established Southwest People's Art Academy in Southwest China. In addition to training general literary and artistic youth, these art academies also trained a considerable number of local and military literary and artistic cadres in 1950. These academies are not only teaching institutions, but also centers of artistic creation and research activities. They generally have creative and performance departments attached to them as bridges to regularly and directly connect with reality.

　　All types of art academies must pay attention to connecting with reality, pay attention to studying their own national artistic heritage, and overcome and prevent dogmatism and blind worship of Western art in art education.

(7) Protection and Reform of Cultural Relics, Libraries, and Museums

　　China has a long history, and there are very many ancient sites and cultural relics with valuable value. The policy of cultural relic work is: (1) protection, (2) collection, (3) focusing on sorting out and reforming old museums and libraries to make them important tools for mass education.

　　In terms of protection, we first focus on (1) preventing the smuggling of precious cultural relics abroad; (2) strictly prohibiting the destruction of ancient buildings, mausoleums, etc., and the arbitrary excavation of ancient cultural sites and ancient tombs across the country. To this end, the Government Administration Council was requested to issue the "Provisional Measures for Prohibiting the Export of Precious Cultural Relics and Books," the "Measures for Protecting Ancient Sites, Precious Cultural Relics, Books, and Rare Organisms," the "Provisional Measures for the Investigation and Excavation of Ancient Cultural Sites and Ancient Tombs," and the "Instructions for Protecting Ancient Cultural Relic Buildings." In recent years, incidents of smuggling cultural relics have been greatly reduced. However, the destruction of ancient buildings and precious cultural relics is still happening continuously. Therefore, we must intensify propaganda and education among the masses and cadres, and at the same time impose due sanctions on those who destroy cultural monuments in order to ensure the thorough implementation of government orders.

　　In terms of cultural relic collection, we first focus on collecting old collections from the people to prevent them from being lost. In the past year, the central and local governments have been unable to purchase precious cultural relics scattered among the people on a large scale due to limited funding, but due to the correctness of the government's policy of protecting cultural relics, people have taken out their private collections and donated them to the public, which has become a trend for a while. Among the cultural relics and books donated by the people, there are many precious things. The second is to solicit revolutionary cultural relics. Since the Government Administration Council issued the "Order for Soliciting Revolutionary Cultural Relics," the central and local governments have received more than a thousand important revolutionary cultural relics, which is the foundation for the preparation of the Revolutionary Museum.

　　In terms of sorting out and reforming old museums and libraries, the Beijing Library and the Palace Museum and the History Museum were taken as the focus, and preliminary reform work was carried out. The Beijing Library has greatly increased the number of new books and periodicals, and展开ed mass work. In 1950, the total number of readers reached 500,000; it also held 27 book exhibitions, with a total of more than 225,000 visitors. The Palace Museum and the History Museum have begun to re-exhibit in accordance with the correct historical viewpoint, starting from several parts.

(8) Popularization of Scientific Knowledge

　　The popularization of scientific knowledge is a new task on the cultural front. Over the past year, various places across the country have united the vast number of scientific workers and started various science popularization activities through lectures, exhibitions, slideshows, publications, and other methods. According to preliminary statistics, more than 90 relatively large-scale science exhibitions have been held in major cities across the country, with a total of approximately 9 million visitors; approximately 300 public science lectures have been held, with more than 100,000 listeners; and more than 300 types of popular science books and periodicals have been published. In science popularization work, slideshows have proven to be a powerful weapon for carrying out current affairs and political propaganda and cultural popularization work among the broad masses, especially the rural masses, and must be greatly promoted in the future.

II. Strengthen Ideological Leadership over National Cultural and Artistic Work, Adjust and Improve Government Cultural Administrative Organizations

　　In the past year, one of the most serious shortcomings in the work of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government was the lack of ideological policy leadership over national cultural and artistic work. This is mainly manifested in the failure to properly organize and lead the creative forces in cultural and artistic aspects, the failure to fully mobilize and organize cultural and artistic cadres to go to various practical mass struggles, and the failure to conduct sufficient and careful ideological examination of the products of various departments of culture and art. There has also been insufficient research on policy issues related to culture and art. The formation of this shortcoming is mainly due to the fact that we have not sufficiently recognized in our thinking that the work of the Ministry of Culture is an ideological work; instead, we have put too much energy into general administrative affairs, resulting in a certain degree of bureaucratism. The most significant shortcomings in the organizational structure of the Ministry of Culture are the separation of administrative leadership from business management, which leads the leadership to be busy with business and relax ideological policy leadership facing the whole country. This situation has also contributed to the bureaucratic style. The First National Cultural Administrative Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government in March comprehensively discussed and determined the adjustment of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government and cultural administrative institutions at all levels. The various bureaus under the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government will be merged and reorganized into three administrative bureaus for film, art, and social and cultural undertakings. The undertakings originally managed by the various bureaus will be separated to establish independent undertakings or enterprises. After this adjustment, the institutions will be more centralized, and the division of labor will be more reasonable.

　　At present, the cultural and artistic institutions of provinces and cities are mostly unsound. Although the cultural and educational departments and bureaus of provinces and cities have been changed from "education" to "culture and education," most of them are actually "educated but not cultured." This has also increased the difficulty of the central government's leadership over local cultural and artistic work. The National Cultural Administrative Conference determined that under the cultural and educational departments and bureaus, three sections (departments) for film, art, and social culture should be set up according to different situations, or a single section (department) for culture and art should be set up, and one of the director and deputy director of the department and bureau should be specifically responsible for leadership. Special districts and counties should designate or add one to three people in the cultural and educational sections to specifically do cultural and artistic work.

　　After the above-mentioned adjustments and strengthening of the central and local cultural administrative institutions, it is believed that the grasp of the national cultural and artistic work situation and the strengthening of policy and ideological leadership can be better than now.

III. Key Points of the 1951 Work Plan

　　1. Further Develop the Film Industry

　　(1) Strengthen the planning and ideological leadership of national film production, and gradually improve the ideological and artistic quality of state-run films on the basis of meeting the requirements of popularization. In 1951, state-run factories plan to produce 14 feature films (including three or four key films) and 10 documentaries, and organize and assist private factories to produce 20 feature films. Strive to ensure that the progressive films produced by state-run and private film factories are sufficient to supply the national film market within this year and next year, so as to completely eliminate negative films nationwide.

　　(2) Strengthen and improve the management of national cinemas. According to needs and possibilities, the state or encourages private capital investment to set up new cinemas in small and medium-sized cities, suburbs of large cities, and workers' districts.

　　(3) Establish 700 to 800 film projection teams nationwide to ensure their film supply (due to the difficulty of film source and the lack of developing equipment, the film projection teams cannot be greatly expanded in one or two years).

　　(4) All state-run distribution units should implement enterprise management, and all state-run production units should implement film production enterprise management; establish a Chinese film equipment company and a projector repair factory, and complete the design plan of a large-scale machine developing factory.

　　2. Strengthen Opera Reform Work

　　(1) The central government and major administrative regions with conditions should establish opera research institutes. Establish at least one publicly owned or jointly owned by public and private entities or privately owned with public assistance theater and troupe in each provincial capital and major city, formulate performance plans for opera programs on a regular basis, and gradually reform their internal management systems as a base for promoting local opera reform work. Strengthen and improve the management of national opera theaters, and strive to ensure that the performance of new or revised opera repertoires and original excellent repertoires accounts for a complete advantage in the provincial capitals and major cities within two years.

　　(2) Review and revise 50 old Peking opera scripts. Review and revise 30 Ping opera, Yue opera, and other local opera scripts (the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government and the local cultural authorities in the regions where the operas are most popular will divide the work and cooperate). The reviewed version will be published by the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government and promoted nationwide. Collect, sort out, and research folk drama and music materials from various places, and record or print them.

　　(3) Organize new drama workers to cooperate with opera performers to create new opera scripts. Strive to ensure that each popular opera type produces at least one to two relatively successful scripts each year.

　　(4) Continue to hold training and education work for performers, and strive to ensure that the main opera performers across the country receive a certain period of training within two years.

　　3. Rectify the existing literary and art work troupes and drama troupes nationwide, clarify the tasks and division of labor of literary and art work troupes and drama troupes at all levels, and properly solve the problems of learning and improvement for cadres of literary and art work troupes. Strive to ensure that each larger-scale troupe or literary and art work troupe in each important province and city produces at least one large (multi-act) or three small (one-act) relatively successful scripts each year.

　　4. Develop new serial pictures and New Year pictures. Improve the content and distribution methods of new serial pictures, and strengthen the unity and transformation work of old serial picture painters and publishers. Publish regular periodicals of serial pictures and 50 types of better new serial pictures. Strive to ensure that harmful serial pictures are no longer printed in major cities across the country within two years. Train painting talents to meet the needs of various places to develop New Year pictures, serial pictures, and popular publications.

　　5. Strengthen the work of the People's Literature Publishing House, rectify the publication of literary and artistic books nationwide, adjust national literary and artistic publications, and publish a large number of popular literary and artistic works.

　　6. Strengthen art education. Adjust the academic system and curriculum of art academies in the central government and major administrative regions. Provinces and cities can set up short-term art training classes according to needs and possibilities. Art academies may set up special classes as needed and possible to train art cadres from ethnic minorities.

　　7. Consolidate and develop mass amateur art activities in rural areas and factories. Cultural and educational authorities and literary and art work troupes at all levels should be responsible for providing suitable singing materials. Each drama troupe and literary and art work troupe should establish regular and fixed assistance relationships with one or more mass amateur art organizations.

　　8. Consolidate and enrich the existing cultural centers in various places. Strive to ensure that there is a cultural center in every county within two years. Establish rural clubs in qualified villages and towns. Cultural centers and clubs are determined to take literacy education, current affairs propaganda, cultural entertainment, and popularizing scientific knowledge as their main tasks.

　　9. Develop the slideshow business and complete the manufacture of 5,000 standard slideshow machines. Establish slideshow machine manufacturing institutions in qualified areas. Slideshows are generally drawn by local areas themselves. Slideshow cadres are also trained by local areas themselves, and the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government provides guidance and assistance.

　　10. Rectify and enrich the existing libraries in the central government, major administrative regions, and provinces and cities, establish reading rooms in qualified villages and towns, and develop rural book networks.

　　11. Rectify and enrich the existing museums and science museums in the central government, major administrative regions, and provinces and cities. Improve display methods and strengthen mass work (mainly explanation work for the audience). Strengthen the protection and management of cultural relics and monuments. Prepare to establish a Central Revolutionary Museum. In qualified major administrative regions or provinces and cities, prepare to establish local comprehensive museums.

　　中央人民政府文化部
    一九五零年全国文化艺术工作报告与一九五一年计划要点
    （一九五一年四月二十日周扬副部长在政务院第八十一次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准。）
  一、一九五零年全国文化艺术工作情况
    一年以来，全国文化艺术工作总方针是普及与提高人民新的爱国的文化，而以普及为第一位的任务。在文化上的新旧统一战线与公私兼顾的原则下，一方面巩固和发展新的文化、艺术事业，另一方面有步骤有重点地改革旧有文化艺术事业，一方面巩固和发展国家经营的文化、艺术事业，另一方面领导私人经营的文化、艺术事业，并有重点地扶助这些事业，使其更有计划性，而能与国营的文化、艺术事业取得良好的配合。在整个文化艺术工作中，首先选择那些对于开展普及工作最为需要，在广大人民中间最有影响的部门作为重点来进行。
    现在就根据上述方针来检讨一年来的主要工作。
  （一）电影事业
    电影事业在整个文化艺术工作中，是第一个重点，这是因为电影是最有力量的艺术形式。据一九五零年统计，全国全年电影观众达一亿五千万人以上。国营电影制片厂现有东北、北京、上海三厂。一九五零年国营厂共出产故事片二十六部，美术片一部，教育短片与纪录片十六部，新闻简报六十二本，和苏联合制的五彩纪录片二部，翻译苏联故事片四十三部，翻译苏联教育短片四十二部。国营厂的故事片和纪录片一般都能忠实地反映中国人民，特别是工农兵的生活与斗争，其中一部分在思想上和艺术上并已达到一定的水平。
      在同时期内，私营制片厂共摄制故事片三十四部，大部分也能保有进步的思想内容和严肃的创作态度。
    由于国营片与私营厂进步片的源源生产，苏联片的大量译制，加以观众政治水平的提高，在一年之内，使得城市影院进步片的观众，由少数而转为多数。一九五零年底，进步片观众已占观众总数约百分之六十五至七十。在电影市场上，英美帝国主义国家的有害影片已基本肃清。即以美国影片势力最大的上海而言，一年来美国片也已为广大观众所唾弃，而以人民民主斗争为主题的国产影片则受到极大欢迎；这是电影市场的空前变化，是文化战线上的一个巨大胜利。
    在影片发行方面，据现有统计，全国共有电影院六七四所，其中公营的三四二所，公私合营的十六所，私营的三一六所。电影局直辖的影片经理公司在各大行政区均设有分公司，以统一全国影片发行工作，在影院较多的城市中，采取了统一排片的办法，并力求做到民主协商、公私兼顾。为使人民电影能深入农村、部队、矿山和工厂，一九五零年度训练了放映员一千八百余人，并建立了放映队所用十六毫米拷贝的小型手工洗印厂。全国原有一百多个放映队，放映机定货到齐之后，全国将有放映队七百个以上。一九五零年，由于胶片数量的不足及洗印设备上的限制，国营厂未能及时供应各地各方面以足量拷贝，致发生严重的供不应求的现象。因此，必须在今后数年内建立电影工业的基础，达到器材自给，同时加强电影干部的培养训练工作，为电影事业的更大发展准备必要的条件。
    今天电影出品无论在量和质上都还不能完全满足观众的需要。国营厂所出影片中虽产生了若干优秀的故事片（如《白毛女》、《钢铁战士》、《新儿女英雄传》等）和优秀的纪录片，但也产生了一些思想性、艺术性薄弱，甚至在政治思想上有严重缺点错误，在艺术作风上反现实主义的作品（如《荣誉属于谁》）。对私营电影制片业，我们虽在经济方面分别情况地给予了不同程度的扶助，但对其制片的思想领导却是不够的。例如，昆仑公司的《武训传》就是一部对历史人物与历史传统作了不正确表现的，在思想上错误的影片。因此加强对全国电影制片的思想领导已成为整个文化艺术工作中一项极端重要的任务。
  （二）戏曲改革工作
    旧戏曲有悠久传统，现有剧目在千种以上，大小剧种近百种，全国戏曲艺人约三十万人，旧戏曲观众全国每日在百万人左右；旧戏曲与广大人民的生活有如此密切的联系，因此戏曲改革工作也是文化艺术工作的重点之一。
    一年多来，各地戏曲改革工作已获得初步成绩；新编戏曲为数不少，若干作品已证明为群众所欢迎；这一事实，大大地鼓励了广大艺人改革旧有戏曲的信心和勇气。其中尤以地方戏的改革更为活跃。越剧、评剧在表现现代生活上均取得了成功的经验。要使戏曲改革工作广泛开展，必须获得广大艺人的自觉自愿的努力与合作。一九五零年内，全国艺人中已有三万多人参加学习。经过学习，提高了他们的政治觉悟，加强了团结友爱，并使他们初步获得了文艺为人民服务的观点。
    但各地的戏曲改革工作中，也曾发生过一些偏差和缺点。这表现在两个方面：一方面对于旧戏曲缺乏一定的审查标准与积极的改进方案，而单纯地采取禁演的办法，以致禁戏过多，在有些地区中在一个时期里，造成艺人们的生活困难，同时也引起了群众的不满；另一方面有的地方则又对旧戏曲采取放任自流的态度，没有积极的加以领导。此外，在戏曲的修改与创作方面，虽然有了若干成就，但也有不少作品是反历史主义的、公式主义的，这些作品不是按历史唯物主义的观点来反映历史真实，而是将历史人物“现代化”，将历史事迹与现代人民革命斗争的事迹作不适当的比拟。中央文化部在一九五零年十一月下旬召开的全国戏曲工作会议，明确规定了以历史观点和爱国观点作为审查剧目的标准、旧有戏曲中一切有重要毒害的内容，及表演形式上一切野蛮、恐怖、残酷、猥亵、奴化的成份，必须坚决加以改革；存在于编改剧本工作中的某些反历史主义的、公式主义的倾向，必须加以纠正。会议鼓励中国现有各种戏曲形式的自由竞赛，而以对当地群众影响最大的剧种为主要改革与发展对象。会议并规定今后戏曲改革工作，应统一由各地文教主管机关领导。凡对人民有重大毒害、必须禁演的戏曲，则应统一由中央文化部处理。
  （三）文艺工作团与群众业余艺术活动
    在普及工作上具有极大重要性的，还有遍布于全国的文艺工作团。对于文工团加强领导，也是文化艺术工作的重点之一。
    据初步估计，目前全国文工团（队）在二百个以上，专业的戏剧、音乐干部约二万人（部队的文工团（队）和文艺工作干部远超过此数，未计算在内）。
    文工团是文艺工作与宣传工作的最重要的组织形式之一，是联系普及与提高的桥梁，是培养文艺干部的流动学校。他们深入农村、部队、工厂、演出了《白毛女》、《刘胡兰》、《红旗歌》、《王秀鸾》及许多配合当前任务的宣传剧，对广大群众起了重大的鼓动与教育作用。他们长期地、艰苦地坚持了在群众中的文艺宣传工作，他们是对革命事业有贡献的。
    除了综合性的文工团而外，在首都及上海、天津等大城市还建立了专业的话剧团、歌剧团、歌舞团、舞蹈团、音乐工作团及以上演话剧或歌剧为主的剧院。
    对全国文工团、剧团必须加以整顿和充实。首先要明确规定各级文工团、剧团的任务与分工：中央、大行政区、大城市的文工团、剧团向剧院发展，以建设剧场艺术为主；省、中等城市的文工团、剧团以剧场演出与巡回演出相结合；专区文工队则以巡回演出为主。对文工团员应予以学习和深造的机会，使之在业务上得到提高。
    在文工团与文艺工作者的帮助指导之下，群众业余艺术活动有极大的发展。各大城市的工厂几乎都建立了自己的业余艺术组织，展开了戏剧、音乐、绘画及其他文艺活动。工人在艺术创作上也表现了他们的智慧和创造力。至于农村，老区和半老区的农村剧团，一年来数量大增，以省为单位计算，村剧团少者近千，多者四、五千。新区经过土地改革以后，农村剧团亦如雨后春笋，发展极为迅速。群众业余艺术活动，必须密切结合生产，不违背业余的、自愿的、季节性的原则，文工团及其它专业文艺团体必须对群众业余艺术活动负起指导的责任。
  （四）连环图画与年画
    发展新连环图画与新年画，改革旧连环图画与旧年画，这是美术工作方面的重点。
    中央文化部于一九四九年底，发布了开展新年画工作的指示。一九五零年全国有二十六个地区出版了新年画，根据不完全统计，共四百余种七百余万份。新年画中已有了一些优秀的作品。新年画实际上就是一种宣传画。
    北京、上海及全国各地，一年多来，已出版新连环图画七百余种。上海向来是连环图画的出版中心，出版连环图画的书店有七十余家，出卖与出租连环图画的书摊有三千余处，历年来所出连环图画在两千八百多万册以上，大半为武侠神怪故事，其有害的影响是很大的。新连环图画绝大部分也是上海出版的。新连环图画已受到了干部和群众的重视与欢迎。但其中有不少作品，内容与形式尚存在着缺点，因而还不能为广大读者所满足。
    在改革旧年画与连环图画的工作中，对旧年画与连环图画的绘画工作者和出版者曾进行了团结与教育的工作。许多旧年画与旧连环图画的绘画工作者热心地参加了绘制新年画、新连环图画的工作。但目前，上海某些私营出版业，仍在翻印旧内容的画片与连环图画，旧年画与旧连环图画，今天尚拥有广大的市场。加强与改进新连环图画与新年画的出版工作，是美术宣传方面的最重要的任务。
  （五）文艺书籍的出版工作
    一九五○年出版的文艺书籍，据初步统计，约有二千七百余种，一千七百余万册，文艺期刊及副刊九十种以上。在文艺书籍的出版工作中，存在着无计划无领导的自流状态。在全国的私营出版业中间，认真负责者固然不少，然而也有不认真不负责的出版商，单纯以营利为目的，粗制滥造的风气相当严重。
    一九五○年成立了国营的人民文学出版社。这个出版社将有计划地出版中国现代和古代的文学、世界古典的和进步的文学，并与全国各地公私营文艺书籍出版业，实行正确的分工合作，使整个文艺书籍出版事业逐步走向正常的健全的发展。在整个文艺书籍的出版工作上，应特别注意通俗文艺书刊的出版，以满足广大工农群众的需要。
  （六）艺术教育事业
    在中央文化部直接领导下的培养艺术干部的机构，有中央戏剧学院、中央音乐学院、中央美术学院和中央文学研究所。在各大行政区，有东北的鲁迅文艺学院，华东的中央音乐学院上海分院和中央美术学院华东分院，西北有新建的西北人民艺术学院，中南有中原大学文艺学院和新建的华南人民文学艺术学院，西南有新建的西南人民艺术学院。这些艺术学院，除培养一般文艺青年外，一九五零年中还调训了相当数量的地方与部队的文艺干部。这些学院不只是教学机关，而且也是艺术创作与研究活动的中心，一般附设有创作及演出的部门，作为经常地直接地联系实际的桥梁。
    各类艺术学院均必须注意与实际的联系，注意研究自己民族的艺术遗产，克服与防止艺术教育工作上的教条主义与盲目崇拜西洋的错误倾向。
  （七）文物与图书馆、博物馆的保护与改革
    我国历史悠久，具有宝贵价值的古迹文物是非常之多的。文物工作的方针就是：（一）保护，（二）搜集，（三）有重点地整理与改革旧有博物馆图书馆使其成为进行群众教育的重要工具。
    在保护方面，首先着眼于（一）防止珍贵文物的偷运出国；（二）严禁毁坏古建筑、陵墓等及任意发掘各地古文化遗迹及古墓葬。为此，曾呈请政务院发布了《禁止珍贵文物图书出口暂行办法》、《古迹、珍贵文物、图书及稀有生物保护办法》、《古文化遗址及古墓葬之调查发掘暂行办法》、以及《保护古文物建筑办法的指示》。年来文物偷漏出口事件，已大为减少。但古建筑及珍贵文物之被毁坏，却仍在陆续发生。因此必须对群众及干部加紧宣传教育，同时对破坏文化古迹者予以应有制裁，才能保证政令之彻底执行。
    在文物搜集方面，首先着眼于收罗民间旧藏，勿使散佚。一年来，中央及地方限于经费，尚不能大事收购散在民间的珍贵文物，但由于政府保护文物政策之正确，人民出其私藏，捐献归公，一时成为风气。在人民捐献的文物图书中有不少珍贵的东西。其次为征求有关革命的文物。自政务院发布《征集革命文物令》后，中央及地方收到有关革命的重要文物，已不下千余件，这是筹建革命博物馆的基础。
    在整理并改革旧有的博物馆、图书馆方面，以北京图书馆及故宫博物院、历史博物馆作为重点，进行了初步改革工作。北京图书馆大量地增添了新书刊，并开展了群众工作，一九五○年全年读者达五十万人；又曾举行图书展览二十七次，参观人数达二十二万五千余人。故宫博物院、历史博物馆由若干部分开始，已按正确的历史观点重新陈列。
  （八）科学知识普及工作
    科学知识普及工作是文化战线上一项新的工作。一年来，全国各地团结了广大的科学工作者通过讲演、展览、幻灯、出版等方式，开始了各种科学普及活动。据初步统计，全国各主要城市所举办较有规模的科学展览会共九十余次，观众总计约九百余万人；举办公开科学讲演约三百次，听众十余万人；通俗科学书刊出版共达三百余种。在科学普及工作中，幻灯已证明是向广大群众，特别是农村群众进行时事政治宣传与文化普及工作的有力武器，今后必须大量地加以推广。
  二、加强对全国文化艺术工作的思想领导，
      调整与健全政府文化行政组织
    过去一年，中央文化部的工作中一个比较最严重的缺点是对全国文化艺术工作的思想政策领导不够。这主要表现在对文化艺术方面的创造力量没有很好地加以组织和领导，没有充分地发动与组织文化艺术干部到各种实际的群众斗争中去，对文化艺术各部门的生产品没有足够地仔细地进行思想检查。对有关文化艺术的政策性问题，也研究得不够。这种缺点的形成，主要由于我们在思想上没有足够认识文化部的工作是一个思想的工作；而将过多的精力放在一般行政事务上，致形成某种程度的事务主义作风。文化部组织机构上的缺点，最显著的是行政领导与事业经营不分，致领导方面忙于事业而放松面向全国的思想政策的领导，这种情形也助长了事务主义作风。中央文化部在三月间召开的第一届全国文化行政会议，通盘讨论并确定了中央文化部及各级文化行政机构的调整，将中央文化部所属各局合并改组为电影、艺术和社会文化事业三个管理局，将原属各局掌管的事业划出成立单独的事业或企业机构，这样调整以后，机构就更集中，分工也较合理了。
    省、市文化、艺术机构目前大都不健全，省、市文教厅、局虽已由“教育”改为“文教”，但实际上大多“有教无文”。这也增加了中央对地方文化、艺术工作的领导的困难。全国文化行政会议确定：在文教厅、局下应根据不同情况分设电影、艺术、社会文化三处（科）或单设文化艺术一处（科），并由正副厅、局长中一人专责领导。专署与县，则在文教科内指定或增设一至三人专做文化、艺术工作。
    中央与地方文化行政机构经过上述调整与加强之后，对全国文化、艺术工作情况的掌握，政策思想领导的加强，相信可以比现在要好。
  三、一九五一年工作计划要点
    一、进一步发展电影事业
    （一）加强全国电影制片的计划性与思想领导，在适应普及要求的基础上，逐步提高国营影片的思想性与艺术性。一九五一年度国营厂计划摄制故事片十四部（其中有三、四部重点片）、纪录片十部，组织与协助私营厂摄制故事片二十部。争取在今年明年两年内做到国营与私营电影厂所产的进步片足够供应全国电影市场，达到在全国范围内完全肃清消极影片。
    （二）加强与改进全国电影院的管理。并按照需要与可能，由国家或鼓励私人资本投资，在中小城市、大城市的郊区、工人区设置新的电影院。
    （三）全国建立七百至八百个电影放映队，保证其影片供应（因胶片来源困难及洗印设备不足，一两年内电影放映队还不能更大量地扩充）。
    （四）各国营发行单位全部实行企业化，各国营制片单位实行制片企业化；建立中国电影器材公司及放映机修理厂，完成大型机器洗印厂的设计计划。
    二、加强戏曲改革工作
    （一）中央与有条件的大行政区建立戏曲研究院。在各省省会、各大城市建立至少一个公营或公私合营或私营公助的剧场与剧团，按期订立戏曲节目的上演计划，逐步改革其内部管理制度，作为推进当地戏曲改革工作的据点。加强与改进全国戏曲剧场的管理，争取在两年内，做到在各省省会及各大城市中新的或经过修改的戏曲剧目与原有优良剧目的演出占完全优势。
    （二）审定与修改旧有京剧剧本五十种。评剧、越剧及其他地方戏剧本各三十种（由中央文化部与各该剧种最流行地区的当地文化主管机关分工合作）。审定本由中央文化部加以刊行，推行全国。搜集、整理、研究各地民间戏剧、音乐材料，加以录音或刊印。
    （三）组织新戏剧工作者与戏曲艺人合作，创作新的戏曲剧本。做到每一流行剧种，一年中至少产生一个至二个比较成功的剧本。

    三、整顿全国现有文工团和剧团，明确各级文工团和剧团的任务与分工，适当解决文工团干部的学习与提高问题。做到全国各重要省市每一规模较大之剧团或文工团，一年中至少产生一个大型的（多幕的）或三个小型的（独幕的）比较成功的剧本。
    四、发展新连环图画、新年画。改进新连环图画内容与发行方法，加强对旧连环图画家与出版商的团结改造工作。出版连环图画定期刊物与较好的新连环图画五十种。争取在两年内做到在全国各大城市有害连环图画不再印行。培养绘画人才，供各地发展新年画、连环图画及通俗刊物之需要。
    五、加强人民文学出版社的工作，整顿全国文艺书籍的出版工作，调整全国文艺刊物，大量出版通俗文艺作品。
    六、加强艺术教育工作。调整中央与大行政区各艺术学院的学制与课程。省市可按照需要与可能设立短期艺术训练班。艺术学院得视需要与可能设立专门班次，培养少数民族艺术干部。
    七、巩固与发展农村、工厂的群众业余艺术活动。各级文教主管机关、文工团、队应负责供给适合的演唱材料。各剧团、文工团、队均应与一个以上的群众业余艺术组织建立经常的、固定的协助关系。
    八、巩固与充实各地现有文化馆。争取在两年内做到每一个县有一个文化馆。在有条件的村镇设立农村俱乐部。文化馆、俱乐部确定以识字教育、时事宣传、文化娱乐及普及科学知识为主要任务。
    九、发展幻灯事业，完成五千架标准幻 灯机的制造。在有条件地区建立幻灯机制造机构。幻灯片一般由各地自行绘制。幻灯干部亦由各地自行训练，由中央文化部加以指导与帮助。
    十、整顿并充实中央、各大行政区及省市现有的图书馆，在有条件的村镇设立图书室，发展农村图书网。
    十一、整顿并充实中央、各大行政区及省市现有的博物馆、科学馆。改进陈列方法，加强群众工作（主要为对观众的解说工作）。加强文物古迹的保护与管理。筹设中央革命博物馆。在有条件的大行政区或省市，筹设地方的综合性博物馆。
