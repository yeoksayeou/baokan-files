　　Wuhan Establishes Marxism-Leninism Night School; Organizes Lecturer Group to Solve the Problem of Teacher Shortage
　　The Wuhan Municipal机关 Marxism-Leninism Night School officially opened in April. The first group of trainees are in-service cadres selected by the directly subordinate organs of the Central South Bureau, Wuhan Municipality, and Hubei Province. After graduation, they will concurrently serve as theory instructors in their original departments.
　　The leadership of this school is jointly composed of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central South Bureau, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central South Military and Political Committee Directly Subordinate Committee, and the Propaganda Department of the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee, with Comrade Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central South Bureau, serving as the principal. The whole school studies three subjects: basic political knowledge, basic questions of the Chinese revolution, and the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism. Currently, there are 513 formal students and 243 auditors. An important aspect of successful theoretical study is having dedicated people in charge of helping and guiding. The Wuhan Marxism-Leninism Night School is an effective method for cultivating such talent. There are difficulties in establishing such night schools. The first is the shortage of teachers. Wuhan solved this difficulty by organizing a lecturer group. The group hired more than 50 responsible comrades and professors from the Wuhan municipal Party, government, and military organs, determined that each person should prepare two topics (with some remuneration) in their respective fields within a certain period, write outlines (or papers), and lecture at the night school; at the same time, they should also give public speeches on other occasions or on the radio. In this way, not only was the difficulty of teacher shortage solved, but also a group of key personnel for theoretical education work was formed around the Party.
　　Wanbei Region Launches In-Service Cadre Study to Prepare Conditions for Implementing a Formal Academic Year System
　　Theoretical study for in-service cadres in various Wanbei organs has begun successively. Party committees at all levels are preparing conditions for implementing a formal academic year system next year, paying attention to training study instructors and rotating cadres for training. This year, the in-service cadre study in the Wanbei region is roughly divided into three types according to different levels: the first type is cultural night school for service personnel and some cadres with low education levels; the second type is political night school for those with a certain level of culture and political knowledge but poor self-study ability. The political night school focuses on the basic questions of the Chinese revolution, with two lectures per week, allocating a certain amount of time for self-reading and organizing discussions; the third type is mainly self-study for those with self-study ability, who choose their own learning content and formulate study plans for review by their leaders. In the process of learning, discussions can be organized according to common content. In order to cultivate talents for guiding study and prepare conditions for the implementation of a formal academic year system next year, the Wanbei District Party Committee has trained study instructors in the Party School, selecting two courses for study: one is historical materialism—the history of social development, and the other is the questions of the Chinese revolution; the training is expected to last four months. Local district committee Party training courses have also been restored successively, preparing to train political common sense teachers, with the Common Program, the Party Constitution, and the Party Program as the content. The duration is about two months.

    武汉创办马克思列宁主义夜校  组织讲师团解决缺少教员问题
    武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜间学校已于四月间正式开学。第一期受训的学员，是中南直属机关、武汉市和湖北各机关选派的在职干部。他们毕业后，将在原来各机关兼任理论教员。
    这个学校的领导机构以中共中央中南局宣传部、中南军政委员会直属党委宣传部及中共武汉市委宣传部共同组成，由中共中央中南局宣传部部长赵毅敏同志兼校长。全校分别学习三种科目：政治常识，中国革命基本问题，马克思列宁主义基础。目前共有正式学员五百一十三人，旁听生二百四十三人。搞好理论学习的重要环节是要有专人负责帮助指导，武汉市马克思列宁主义夜校便是培养这类人才的有效方法。创办这种夜校是有困难的。首先就是缺少教员。武汉市以组织讲师团的方法解决了这个困难。该团共聘请武汉市党、政军机关的负责同志和教授五十余人，确定在一定时期之内，每人分科准备两个题目（均略致酬劳），写好提纲（或论文），一方面为夜校讲课；同时并在其他场合或广播电台作公开演讲。这样就不但解决了师资缺乏的困难，而且在党的周围组成了一批进行理论教育工作的骨干。
            皖北地区开展在职干部学习  为实行正规学年制准备条件
    皖北各机关在职干部理论学习已先后开始。各级党委正为明年实行正规学年制准备条件，注意了培养学习指导员和轮训干部。今年皖北区的在职干部学习，根据不同程度，大体分为三种：第一种是文化水平低的勤杂人员和一部分干部，进文化夜校学习。第二种是有一定文化与政治水平，但自学能力较差的，进政治夜校学习，政治夜校以中国革命基本问题为中心内容，每周听课两次，以一定时间自己阅读并组织讨论。第三种是有自学能力的，以自学为主，自己选择学习内容，拟订学习计划交领导上审阅。在学习的过程中，可根据共同的内容组织讨论。皖北区党委为了培养学习指导人才，为明年实行正规学年制准备条件，已在党校训练学习指导员，选择了两种课程进行学习：一种是历史唯物论——社会发展史，一种是中国革命问题；预计训练四个月。各地委党训班亦已先后恢复，准备训练政治常识教员，其内容为：共同纲领、党章、党纲。时间为两个月左右。
