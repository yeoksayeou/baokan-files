Guan Changhai Rescues Ammunition Train
       By Ying Tao
    (16) Guan Changhai enthusiastically gestured to the Korean People's Army, waving a flag. The People's Army understood his meaning and ran over from the highway.
    (17) Guan Changhai uncoupled the vehicles one by one, and gestured again, asking everyone to push them further away. In a total of fifteen or sixteen minutes, the cannons and medicines from the eleven carriages were safely rescued.
    (18) That night, the rescued ammunition trains, artillery trains, and medicine trains successively drove towards the front line. Batch after batch of prisoners were also escorted down from the front. The heroic Chinese Aid-Korea railway workers are guaranteeing the connection between the front and the rear, and guaranteeing the victory of the Chinese and Korean people's forces. (The End)

    （十六）关长海热情地向朝鲜人民军做手势，幌旗子。人民军明白了他的意思，便从公路上跑过来。
    （十七）关长海把车辆一一卸开，又做手势，请大家往远处推。总共用了十五、六分钟，把十一个车厢的大炮和药品，都安全抢救出来。
    （十八）当夜，抢出的弹药车、炮车、药品车陆续开往前线。一批批的俘虏也从前方押下来。英勇的中国援朝铁路工人们，就是这样保证了前方和后方的联系，保证了中朝人民部队的胜利。（完）
