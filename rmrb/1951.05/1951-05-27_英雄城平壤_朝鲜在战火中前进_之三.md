　　Heroic City of Pyongyang
    ——“Korea Advances Through the Flames of War” (3)
    Liu Baiyu
    Pyongyang is an unyielding banner on the Korean battlefield, enduring the bombing of the American imperialists every day. From the beginning of the war until now, hundreds of days and nights have passed, but Pyongyang continues to lead the people in their fight.
    One night, I set out from a place a hundred miles away to visit this heroic city. The moonlight that day was exceptionally bright, illuminating the Korean valleys and tranquil forests, shining on the artillery tractors heading to the front. The artillery pieces were covered with camouflage netting, and the soldiers on the tractors gazed at the sky. Planes dropped flares not far away, the green light flickering, but we continued to advance. At an intersection in Kangdong County, a traffic guard waved a white flag, signaling us to stop. He asked where we were going, and we replied, “Pyongyang.” He said that a bridge ahead was bombed, and we had to take a detour on a small road. It was indeed a road full of ice, snow, and mud! We crossed the Taedong River, its banks lined with winding trenches, now filled with snow. The wreckage of destroyed cannons and tanks reminded us: “A brutal war took place here! Every inch of this land was reclaimed through such a war.” We passed through a section of mountains and forests, then returned to a level highway. The comrade from the People's Army Headquarters guiding us told me that Pyongyang was ahead. Our jeep sped forward like lightning. Soon, I saw the dark silhouette of a huge factory building on the left, followed by Kim Il-sung University. But our speed slowed down because the highway disappeared before us. It was the first time I had seen so many massive bomb craters. This was utterly bestial, aimless bombing, destroying not only the roads but even the fields. Our car lurched as if in huge waves. I understood: A stupid and cruel beast, when it goes mad, loses all reason. Here, every piece of land in Pyongyang spoke to the world: “Look at the bestial cruelty and shamelessness of the American fascists! Do you want peace? Peace can only be achieved through struggle!”
    I will now recount my impressions of a nighttime trip in Pyongyang.
    Among my impressions, the deepest and most touching was the headquarters of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee. The massive building was damaged, but its towering walls stood erect in the moonlight, bravely expressing a spirit of unyielding defiance.
    As we entered the city, an unexpectedly delightful scene immediately captivated me. Look, there were so many cars, truly shoulder to shoulder, artillery tractors, military vehicles, and swiftly moving jeeps, all converging into a massive torrent, passing through the capital, heading to the front. Amidst the ruins, countless soldiers were busy in the darkness, pushing massive anti-aircraft guns. Daily, based on new experiences, they moved their positions, waiting for enemy aircraft. Thanks to the commendable efforts of the anti-aircraft gunners, enemy planes were continuously shot down over Pyongyang, making Pyongyang a heroic line of defense in the aerial battle. Telephone poles were severed by bombs, with half of the pole still hanging from the overhead wires. Although the houses were destroyed, this was by no means a dead city, but still the heart of Korea, alive, bustling, tense, and full of vitality. Although there were no lights, the people of Pyongyang lived on. Every night, the people of Pyongyang sent soldiers and transport vehicles, hundreds and thousands surging to the front. Each soldier would lean out the window of the vehicle to see their beloved Pyongyang. Pyongyang was still alive, the heart of the nation was beating, and every night, they transmitted this message to the front.
    We followed a section of the street paved with trolley tracks, then turned toward an area with gardens and Western-style houses. Huge bomb craters constantly appeared in the center of the road. The citizens of Pyongyang, wearing dark, camouflaged clothes, walked on the street. The two Korean comrades in the car with me kept telling me: “Look, that’s Moranbong Hill!” “Look, that’s the office of the Council of Ministers!” It was a white, giant building standing on a hill. The row of bombed-out buildings over there was the headquarters of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee. In the five years of North Korea’s liberation, General Kim Il-sung and the leaders of the Workers' Party established and realized a series of people's democratic practices here. To this day, this way of life has become an unshakable belief and strength among the people. The American aggressors were afraid of these places: “This is the headquarters of the Communists.” When they were driven back by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in the Third Campaign, they poured gasoline and set fire to the buildings as they left, and also buried delayed-action bombs underground. But all these towering walls standing in the moonlight not only make you feel awe and respect, but also perfectly become the characteristic of this unyielding heroic city. I took advantage of this night to see the entire city of Pyongyang. Every inch of land here was suffering persecution, but in every inch that was destroyed, a newer, more beautiful, more heroic, and more courageous Korea was being born. I left these heroic remains with this new understanding and emotion to go to my destination.
    I walked through some silent forests, gardens, and streets. If you think this is a deserted, desolate area, you are wrong. Right in front of this pitch-black wooden house appeared a young gendarmerie soldier. He calmly walked up to us. He saluted, and then requested us:
    “Comrades, please stop!”
    After we explained who we were, he led us through a section of road covered with frost and snow to the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee. I was a little lost, I didn't know where he was taking me, pieces of ruins, like angry rocks, pointed towards the sky. The winter of the war had passed, and water and snow were frozen everywhere on the bombed and burned houses, the wind howled in the chimneys, and I also heard the wind blowing on the broken iron sheets on the roof. The tall trees still had withered leaves on them. He suddenly led us into a dark, collapsed doorway. At this moment, I suddenly realized, I was very touched - the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee, who had created happiness with the Korean people and were now experiencing difficulties together, had not gone to any safe place. Here in Pyongyang, I felt that this brave, fighting party not leaving Pyongyang was as meaningful as not leaving the Korean people. Frankly speaking, this is a proud answer to those dreamers, bloodthirsty American fascist bandits; let your steel teeth of bombs cover Pyongyang, but the Communists in the world will not retreat a step. Because it was dark all night, my eyes couldn't immediately distinguish what was in front of me, but I heard the sound of human footsteps, peaceful and firm footsteps. Suddenly, a complete office appeared in front of me, a simple wartime office, but brightly lit, and the comrades working here looked up to welcome the Chinese comrades. I sat there, next to a stove made from a huge gasoline barrel with a chimney attached, the flames burning brightly, I felt incredibly excited. I walked into the active and real fighting heart of Korea. The Korean comrades told me: Pyongyang, in the hands of the Workers' Party and the People's Army, has never interrupted the intense struggle for even one day, no matter how fierce the bombing and burning. People stood up from the pool of blood, not just the Workers' Party, but also, on these streets, countless people would rather die than leave the capital of their motherland, they cannot leave here, they have been happy here, would they abandon it? No, they never thought that this place could be abandoned, could be left. They believed that Pyongyang would never yield, it was bombed yesterday, it is being bombed now, and they knew it would be bombed tomorrow, but Pyongyang could never be bombed out. The Workers' Party is leading the people of the whole country from here in battle.
    The people of Pyongyang fought heroically, their struggle became one of the model examples of the Korean people's struggle, and it was in those most difficult times that their glorious days began. Last year, the People's Army temporarily withdrew from here, and the American aggressors and the Lee Syngman puppet army entered Pyongyang. A heroine like Zoya appeared here. Her name has not been found yet, but the heroic image of this Korean young woman has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Korean people. This young woman was a female worker at the State Department Store. The comrades retreated to the north, and at that time she was determined to stay here, for the motherland, for the people, she continued to fight. One day, American aggressors and senior officers of Lee Syngman came to the hall of the company to hold a grand banquet. It was at this banquet that she carried out a heroic revenge. She first used grenades to kill more than a dozen American and Lee Syngman puppet army officers. The enemy then rushed to arrest her. She resisted step by step, and retreated to the highest roof of the department store - here was the last border of the motherland, she had nowhere to retreat. She shouted loudly: "Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!" She jumped down from the roof and died heroically. This is the answer of the people of Pyongyang to the invaders in that difficult era. Every inch of land here is soaked with blood. Now, here in the headquarters of the Workers' Party, you will understand how deeply and eternally I will remember these precious days and nights in my life.
    Sitting across from me is Comrade Park Chang-ok, Minister of Propaganda of the Workers' Party Central Committee.
    He is a person who combines decisiveness and ability. He is wearing a yellow uniform, long felt boots, and is covered in dust. He has just rushed from farmers' mass meetings in various parts of South Pyongan Province to meet us in Pyongyang. He brought from the farmers the rich enthusiasm of the people's struggle.
    I am very happy to hear news of ordinary farmers in this central organ.
    He said: "Recently, peasant conferences are being held with the province as the center, and countless farmers have participated in these conferences. This conference is held to discuss new work in the future. I recently went to the local branch and also participated in this gathering. From there, you can see how well the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people get along." He told the following fact with infinite affection: There was an old woman in Kangdong County whose son was killed by the enemy. She and her old man suffered all kinds of torture and were eventually sentenced to death. Just as they were about to be slaughtered, the Chinese People's Volunteers came and liberated them. At this peasant conference, she spoke, saying: When the Volunteers come again, I will take them to our home and treat them well. As she spoke, she took off her sleeves and showed the masses the iron cross branded on her body by the American aggressors.
    But he paused. Because at this kind of meeting, the North Korean people rose up like a storm to accuse the enemy of their atrocities. The strong Comrade Park Chang-ok said that when he heard a young woman accuse the enemy at the meeting, he couldn't help crying four times himself.
    He said: "The enemy killed hundreds of children and mothers in Cheongcheon, separated them and locked them in caves, then poured gasoline into the stone caves and burned them to death; in Yangdeok, the enemy forced each captured person to hold dynamite in their mouths, then lit the fuse and blew them to death; Kim Young-gyeon, the chairman of the Hwanghae Province People's Committee, was sacrificed after the enemy cut off his flesh piece by piece.... At the recent peasant conferences, countless people stood up to accuse the enemy of their brutal crimes. A woman in her twenties spoke while crying, and in just one area of Hwanghae Province, 120,000 people were sacrificed, 20,000 people were sacrificed in Pyongyang, and on average, 80 out of 100 families were persecuted by the enemy."
    Comrade Park Chang-ok's words deeply moved everyone, because it was so real. I saw his eyes and his gestures, resolute, resentful, making you feel pain, but also feeling new life. He solemnly looked at me and continued: "The Korean people will not yield. A female guerrilla captain personally killed twenty-six Americans. There was also a woman who attended the Asian Women's Congress in Beijing the year before last. Because she was pregnant, she could not retreat and insisted on underground struggle in the occupied area, secretly posting slogans on the street. Later, she was arrested by the enemy in Jiangxi... The enemy insulted her, stripped her naked and paraded her, and finally killed her. She resolutely and calmly said: "Kill me! Even if you kill me, you will fail, and our people will definitely return." She died, but her nine-month-pregnant fetus was still writhing in her womb. The cruel American aggressors immediately picked up their submachine guns and killed the fetus as well. Look, how can the people's hatred not be deep! Once at a farmers' enthusiast (activist) meeting, an old man in his sixties came to the meeting wearing linen clothes and a linen hat. He said: "Comrades, my linen clothes are for the one hundred and seventeen women in our area who were raped and killed by American soldiers. Comrades! I have a wish, to catch one hundred and seventeen American soldiers and burn them to ashes, mix them with water, and drink them one bite at a time for three hundred and sixty days a year!" Comrade Park Chang-ok said here, he drew his hand across the table, he said deeply: "Like a white paper cut in half, the war has made the class relations in Korea very clear, and the people know who the enemy is, who they should hate!" These words are very profound, and the Korean people have stood up in the flames with great awakening. They have not only learned to hate, but also learned to fight. A guerrilla captain in Ryonggang area of South Pyongan Province, used to be a farmer and a local party secretary. He had no knowledge of armed struggle. Once a few enemy sentries caught him. The sentries turned around and shouted: "Come here, we have caught a red leader!" He was anxious, so he pressed his hand against the sentry's waist as if it was a gun, and shouted: "Hands up!" and snatched the gun, but he didn't know how to fire it, so he had to smash the sentry's head with the gun. With a smash, the gun "bang" fired. When the enemy heard the gun, they thought the guerrillas had come to meet him and fired a shot, so they didn't dare to come up, and he escaped. Now this farmer has become an excellent guerrilla captain. A few days ago, he came to Pyongyang to attend a meeting, and he called out to Comrade Park Chang-ok: "Minister! Now I can shoot any gun."
    We talked late into the night, almost until dawn. The Minister of Propaganda finally said: "Go and see Pyongyang during the day tomorrow! You can see what the Americans have done in Korea - but Pyongyang is not the most severely damaged, Wonsan and Sariwon are worse than here...."
    Thank you very much for the enthusiastic hospitality of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party. Although it was during the war, although there were several explosions overhead, the peaceful and firm characteristics of the fighting Korean people are even more common in this headquarters. Bombing cannot stop their intense work and normal life.
    In the morning, we came out, and I saw Pyongyang under the sunshine. I saw a tree, this tree standing tall in the air, I thought how precious it was to survive under the dense bombs. Turning from the railway station to Stalin Street, the road was completely jagged, and no house was intact. Going from Moranbong to the west city, I saw a sea-like ridge of roofs next to it, but it was covered with bullet marks and shattered tiles. Finally, we drove to the Taedong River. The entire Pyongyang grew along the wide river bank. Now the river surface is covered with ice and snow, and there is a framed iron bridge on it. This huge bridge connects the most important eastern industrial area of Pyongyang. This bridge can be said to be a heroic bridge. From the first day of the war in the summer of last year, the American aggressors came to bomb Pyongyang every day, and this bridge was the main target of the fascist bombers, but the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery bravely defended the bridge, bombing it every day and preserving it every day, until the end it was not damaged. But now this is a bombed bridge, the broken part is filled with a section of wooden frame, and the broken iron frame is bent and shows the traces of the bombing. When the People's Army and the Volunteers counterattacked Pyongyang, the enemy bombed and strafed here, massacring many Pyongyang citizens, and the river was dyed red with blood. The Taedong River water will never run out, and the people of Pyongyang will always remember their hatred.
    Last night, eight more bombs burned black smoke in the western city that has not yet been extinguished, but Pyongyang, with its ruins and flames, is not only alive, but also advancing. People all over the world remember how many ruins and flames there have been in the world, there have been in Madrid, there have been in Stalingrad, but their names have become beautiful names that are forever cherished by people, heroic names. In Pyongyang, one day, I and the comrades of the Workers' Party worked in the studio for a whole day, and then we went outside, in front of us were trees, and the incomplete streets and houses on the other side, but a touch of red sunset illuminated everything in front of us very beautifully and peacefully. I remember that at that time, Comrade Park Chang-ok stood beside me, he said very sincerely and gently with infinite affection: "I often stand here in the morning to watch, what I see in front of me is not this destroyed street, what I think is the future, what kind of street should we build here, ah! An ideal new Pyongyang..." He smiled at me, as if saying: "Do you think I'm thinking too far!?" I also smiled, my smile was answering him: "No, we are such people, we see tomorrow in the battle, for tomorrow."

　　英雄城平壤
    ——“朝鲜在战火中前进”之三
    刘白羽
    平壤是朝鲜战场上一面不屈服的旗子，她每天都在遭受着美帝国主义者的轰炸。从战争开始到现在，已经是几百个日夜了，可是平壤还是在领导着人民进行战斗。
    一个夜晚，我从百里外出发，去访问这个英雄的城市。那天月光十分皎洁，照耀着朝鲜的山谷和幽静的树林，照着赶赴前方的炮兵牵引车。炮身上覆着伪装网，牵引车上的战士们眼望着天空。飞机在不远的地方投下照明弹，绿色的光闪烁着，我们依然在前进。在江东郡一个路口上，交通哨摇着白旗让我们停止下，问我们到那里去，我们说：“平壤”。他说，前面一道桥梁炸断了，我们得绕小路前去了。那真是一段满是冰雪泥泞的路啊！从水里通过大同江，江两岸布满蜿蜒不绝的战壕，现在雪填满战壕，可是被击毁了的炮与坦克的残骸提醒人们：“这儿进行过残酷的战争！每一寸土地都是经过这样战争夺回来的。”我们穿过一段山和树林，又转到一级公路上来。引路的人民军总部的同志告诉我，前面就是平壤了。于是我们的吉普风驰电闪般前进。很快地我看见左侧出现了一幢巨大工厂建筑的黑影，紧接着是金日成大学。但是我们的驶行速度迟慢下来了，因为公路从我们面前消失了，我第一次看见这样多巨大的弹坑，这是完全兽性的漫无目标的滥炸，不但公路，连田野都毁坏了。我们的车象在巨浪里一样颠簸。我明白了：愚蠢与残忍的野兽，当他发疯时，他是会丧失一切理性的。在这里，平壤每一块土地都在向全世界发言：“你们看看美国法西斯这种兽性的凶残与无耻吧！你们要和平吗？要和平只有斗争！”
    我现在记述我在平壤市的夜间旅行印象。
    印象之中，给我最深刻最感动的印象，是朝鲜劳动党中央党部，巨大的建筑已经毁坏了，可是那危耸的高墙突立在月光之中，凛然表现着一种不屈服的气概。
    当我们一进入市区，突然就有一种意外可喜的场面吸引了我。看，汽车那样的多，真是摩肩接踵，炮兵牵引车，兵车和迅速奔走的吉普，所有的车汇成一条巨大洪流，穿过首都，走向前方。在废墟那面，无数战士在黑暗中忙碌着，战士们在推动着巨大的高射炮，他们每日根据新的经验移动着炮位，等待着敌机。由于高射炮手可敬的功绩，在平壤市空不断击落敌机，平壤成为一条英勇对空战斗的防线。电线杆被炸弹砍断，剩下半截杆顶悬挂在空中电线上，房屋是炸毁了，但这绝不是一个死寂的城市，而仍然是一个朝鲜的心脏，活的、热闹紧张的、生命力十分充沛的城市。虽然这儿没有灯光，但平壤的人生活着，平壤人夜夜送着战士们和运输车辆，成百成千拥上前方去，每个战士都要从车窗口伸出头看看他们心爱的平壤，平壤还活着，国家的心脏在跳跃，他们夜夜把这消息传向前方。
    我们顺着铺有电车钢轨的大街走了一段路，然后转向一片有花园和洋房的地带。马路中心不断出现巨大的弹穴，平壤市民穿着隐蔽色的黑衣服在街上行走。同车两位朝鲜同志不停地告诉我：“你看，这是牡丹峰！”“你看，这是部长会议办公室！”那是一座在山岗上耸立着的白色巨厦。那面一排被炸毁的楼房就是劳动党中央党部。金日成将军和劳动党的领袖们，在北朝鲜解放五年中就在这里确定了、实现了一系列的人民民主生活，这种生活，直至今日，在人民中成为不可撼动的信念与力量。美国侵略者害怕这些地方：“这是共产党的首脑部”，当他们在第三次战役中被中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军驱退的时候，他们临走还浇了汽油然后纵火燃烧，还在地下埋了延期性炸弹，可是这一切森然林立在月光之下的楼墙，不但令你觉得凛然可敬，而且正好成为这个不屈服的英雄城的特征。我趁这夜晚，看了整个平壤市，在这里每一寸土地都在遭受着迫害，但在每一寸被摧毁的地方，都正在诞生着一个更新、更美丽、更英勇、更果敢的朝鲜。我带着这种新的认识与情感，离开这些英雄的遗迹，到我的目的地去。
    我穿行过一些杳无声息的树林、花园和街道。你要是以为这是一片罕无人迹的荒凉地带，那你错了。就在这一间黑漆漆的木房前，出现了一个年青的近警军战士，他从容不迫地走近我们，他敬礼，然后要求我们：
    “同志，请停一停！”
    说过来历，他就引我们穿过一段满复霜雪的道路到劳动党中央党部去。我有一点茫然，我不知道他要带我去到哪里，一片片残垣断壁，如同一块块忿怒岩石向天空指立。战争的冬季过来了，轰炸过燃烧过的房屋上下，到处冻结着水雪，风在烟囱里面打呼哨，我还听到风吹着屋顶被折断的铁片在响，高高的树木上还带着干枯的树叶。他忽然带我们走进一幢黑漆漆的倒塌了的门廊。这时我恍然大悟，我非常感动，——和朝鲜人民一起创造过幸福又正在共历艰难的劳动党中央，他们没有到什么安全的地带去。我在这里，在平壤，我觉得这一个勇敢的战斗的党没有离开平壤是和没有离开朝鲜人民一样有意义的。老实讲，这对那些妄想家、嗜血者的美国法西斯匪徒是一种骄傲的回答；任你炸弹的钢齿布满平壤，但世界上的共产党人是不会退后一步的。由于整夜在黑暗中，我的眼睛一下子分辨不清前面有什么，但我听见了人的脚步声，安祥而坚定的脚步声。突然，眼前出现了一间完整的办公室，战时的简单的办公室，但灯光雪亮，在这里工作的同志们抬起头欢迎中国同志们。我坐到那里，用一个巨大汽油筒加装了烟囱而制成的火炉旁，火焰烧得熊熊的，我感到无比的兴奋。我走到朝鲜的活跃的真正的战斗的心脏。朝鲜同志告诉我：平壤在劳动党、在人民军手里，无论怎样猛烈的轰炸与燃烧，从未一日间断过紧张的斗争。人们从血泊中站立起来，不仅仅是劳动党，同时，在这一条条街道上，无数万人死也不肯离开人民祖国首都，他们不能离开这里，他们在这里幸福过，他们难道就抛弃他，不，他们从来没有想到这儿是可以放弃、可以离开的。他们相信平壤绝不屈服，昨天在轰炸，现在在轰炸，他们知道明天也还要轰炸，但平壤是炸不完的。劳动党从这儿领导全国人民在战斗着。
    平壤市人民进行了英勇的战斗，他们的战斗成为朝鲜人民战斗典型范例之一，正是在那最艰难的时候，他们的光荣的日子也就开始了。去年，人民军从这儿暂时撤退了，美国侵略者和李伪军进入平壤，在这里出现了一个卓娅一样的女英雄，她的名字到现在还未查出来，但这个朝鲜女青年的英勇形象早已深印在朝鲜人民心中。这个女青年是国营百货公司的一个女工作人员。同志们向北方撤退去了，那时她下定决心留在这里，为了祖国，为了人民，她继续战斗。这一天，美国侵略者和李承晚高级军官都到公司的大厅里来举行盛大宴会，就在这宴会上，她进行了壮烈的复仇。她先用手榴弹炸死十几个美国和李承晚伪军的军官，敌人于是扑上来捉捕她，她一步步抵抗着，一直退到百货公司最高的楼顶上——这里就是祖国的最后边境，她没有地方可退了，她就奋声高呼：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！”从楼顶一踊跃下而壮烈牺牲了，这就是平壤人在那艰难时代对侵略者的回答。这里的每一寸土地都浸透了鲜血。现在，我在这劳动党的首脑部里你会懂得在我的一生中，我将多么深刻地永远地记着这珍贵的日夜。
    在我对面坐着劳动党中央宣传部长朴昌玉同志。
    他是一个果断与干练相结合的人物，他穿着一身黄色的制服，长筒毡靴，风尘仆仆，他刚刚从平安南道各处农民群众集会上特地赶来在平壤和我们会见，他从农民那里带来丰富的人民的斗争热情。
    我很高兴在这个首脑机关里听到普通农民的消息。
    他说：“最近以道为中心，在举行农民会议，无数农民纷纷参加了这种会议，开这个会为了讨论今后新的工作，我最近到地方支部去，也参加了这种集会，从那里可以看出中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民相处得多么好。”他以无限深情讲了下面这一段事实：江东郡有一个老太太，她的儿子被敌人杀害了，她和老头子受尽毒刑，结果也判决死刑，正要遭受屠杀的时候，中国人民志愿军来了，解放了他们。在这次农民会议上她发言，她说：志愿军再来我要好好接到我们家里来款待他们。她一面讲一面脱下袖子给群众看，看她身上给美国侵略者烙的铁十字的烙印。
    可是他停了一下。因为在这种会议上，北朝鲜人民暴风雨一样起来控诉敌人的暴行，坚强的朴昌玉同志说，在会议上他听一个年青的妇女控诉的时候，他自己忍不住哭了四次。
    他说：“敌人在清川杀死几百儿童和母亲，把她们分开关闭在山洞里，然后往石洞里倒汽油纵火烧死；在阳德，敌人强迫每个被捕的人嘴上自己衔着炸药，然后燃着引线炸死；黄海道的人民委员长金荣见，给敌人从身上一刀一刀把肉割下，牺牲了……。最近的农民会议上，无数人起来控诉敌人的残暴罪行，一个二十多岁的妇女一面哭一面讲，讲了四十分钟，仅仅黄海道一个地区就牺牲了十二万人，平壤市牺牲两万人，平均一百家里面有八十家受到敌人的迫害。”
    朴昌玉同志的话深深激动着每一个人，因为它是那样真实，我看见他的眼光和他的手势，坚决，愤恨，让你感到痛苦，但又感到新生。他庄严地望着我说下去：“朝鲜人民是不会屈服的，一个女游击队长她亲手杀死了二十六个美国人，还有前年到北京出席亚洲妇女代表大会的一个妇女，她由于怀孕不能撤退而坚持沦陷区地下斗争，在街上秘密粘贴标语，后来在江西被敌人拘捕……敌人侮辱她，把她衣服脱光让她游行，最后再杀死她，她坚决地从容地说：“杀吧！你们杀死我你们也要失败的，我们的人一定会回来的。”她死了，可是她怀孕已经九个月的胎儿还在腹中蠕动，残忍的美国侵略者，立刻端起冲锋枪，把这个胎儿也杀死了。你看，人民的仇恨怎能不深！有一次在一个农民热诚者（积极分子）大会上，有一个六十几岁的老人，他穿了麻衣麻帽到会场上来，他说：“同志们，我的麻衣是为了我们那里美国兵强奸杀死的一百一十七个女人穿的。同志们！我有一个愿望，就是抓住一百一十七个美国兵将他们烧成灰合上水，一年三百六十天我把他一口一口的喝掉！”朴昌玉同志说到这里，他伸出手在桌面上划了一下，他深沉地说：“如同一张白纸划开两半，战争，使朝鲜的阶级关系非常明确了，人民知道了谁是敌人，他应该仇恨谁！”这话十分深刻，朝鲜人民就这样带着巨大的觉醒在火焰中，站立起来了。他们不但学会了憎恨，还学会了战争。平安南道龙江地区有一个游击队长，从前是个农民，是一个地方党书记，对武装斗争一点知识也没有，有一次几个敌人哨兵抓住了他，哨兵转身招喊：“快来人呀，抓了一个红头子呀！”他急了，他就用手抵在哨兵腰里装作是枪，喊：“举手！”就把枪夺下来，可是不知道怎样放，只好用枪往哨兵头上砸，一砸，枪却“砰”一声走了火，那边敌人一听枪响，以为游击队来接应打了枪，不敢上来，他就逃走了。现在这个农民已经成为出色的游击队长，前几天他到平壤来开会，他叫着朴昌玉同志说：“部长！现在我什么枪都会打了。”
    我们谈到深夜，谈到将近黎明。宣传部长最后说：“明天白天去看看平壤吧！你可以看出美国人在朝鲜做了什么？——不过，平壤还不是破坏最严重的，元山和沙里院就比这里还坏……。”
    非常感谢朝鲜劳动党中央的热诚招待。虽然是在战争中，虽然几次爆炸声在头顶上响着，但战斗的朝鲜人民安祥而坚定的特点，在这个首脑部里这更是普遍的特征。轰炸并不能停止他们紧张的工作和正常的生活。
    早晨，我们走出来，我看见了阳光照耀下的平壤，我看见一株树，这树高耸空中，我想这树在密密的炸弹下生存下来是多么可贵。从火车站转向斯大林大街，马路完全变成锯齿形的了，没有一间房屋是完整的。从牡丹峰向西市区去，看见旁边一片海洋似的屋脊，但那上面布满了弹痕和炸碎的瓦砾。最后我们驶向大同江上来，整个平壤就顺着宽阔的江边生长起来的，现在江面上盖着冰雪，上面有一条带架的铁桥，这巨大桥梁联结着平壤市最重要的东部工业区。这桥梁可以说是一座英雄的桥梁，从去年夏季战争开始第一天起，每天美国侵略者来轰炸平壤，这座大桥都是法西斯轰炸手的主要目标，可是人民军高射炮部队英勇的保卫着这座桥梁，天天炸，天天保存下来，一直到最后也没有遭受损害。可是现在这已经是一架被炸断的桥，断处由一截木架添补起来，折断的铁架弯曲地露出炸毁的痕迹。当人民军、志愿军向平壤反攻，敌人溃退时，他们在这儿轰炸扫射，屠杀了许多平壤市民，江水都给血染红了。大同江水是永远流不尽的，平壤人永远记住他们的仇恨。
    昨夜还有八颗炸弹在西市区烧起至今未熄的黑烟，可是平壤城带着废墟与火焰，不但是活着，而且在前进。全世界的人都记得，在世界上有过多少次废墟与火焰，玛德里有过，斯大林格勒有过，但它们的名字成为美丽的永远被人们珍贵的名字，英雄的名字。在平壤，有一天我和劳动党的同志们在工作室整整工作了一天，然后我们走到外面来，面前是树，那面是残缺不全的街道和房屋，但一抹红色夕阳把眼前一切照耀得十分美丽而平静，我记得那时朴昌玉同志站在我身旁，他十分真诚地轻轻地带着无限深情，对我讲：“早晨我常常站在这里看，我眼前看见的不是这破坏了的街道，我想的是将来，在这里我们应该建设怎样一条街，啊！一个理想的新平壤……”他望着我笑了，好象是说：“你觉得我想的太远了吗！？”我也笑了，我的笑意是回答他：“不，我们是这样的人，就是在战斗中看见明天，为了明天。”
