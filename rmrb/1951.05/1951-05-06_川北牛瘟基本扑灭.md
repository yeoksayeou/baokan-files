　　Cattle plague, which once occurred severely in northern Sichuan, has now been basically eradicated. Since February of this year, sporadic cases of bovine "septicemia" and "anthrax" were discovered in Yingshan County, and soon spread to 19 counties in the entire area, resulting in the deaths of 9,897 cattle. After this serious situation occurred, the Northern Sichuan Administrative Office immediately issued an emergency epidemic prevention directive and dispatched 16 epidemic prevention cadres to various counties. Relying on the strength of the masses, a widespread epidemic prevention campaign was launched, treating sick cattle on the one hand and actively carrying out epidemic prevention work on the other, such as sealing off epidemic areas, burying the carcasses of diseased cattle, and improving feeding management and environmental sanitation. From February 12 to March 14, in a period of 31 days, according to incomplete statistics: more than 600 sick cattle had been treated and more than 800 draft cattle had been prevented from getting the disease in the entire area. Now the cattle plague in the whole area has been basically eliminated.

　　川北牛瘟基本扑灭
    川北曾经发生严重牛瘟，现已基本扑灭。自今年二月间开始在营山县零星发现牛的“败血病”和“炭疽病”，不久即遍及全区十九个县，先后死掉九八九七头牛。这一严重情况发生后，川北行署当即发出紧急防疫指示，并派出防疫干部十六人分赴各县，依靠群众力量，广泛掀起防疫运动，一面治疗病牛，一面积极展开防疫工作，如封锁疫区，埋藏病牛尸体，改善饲养管理及环境的清洁卫生等。从二月十二日到三月十四日三十一天间，据不完全统计：全区已治疗病牛六百多头，防治耕牛八百多头。现全区牛瘟基本上已肃清。
