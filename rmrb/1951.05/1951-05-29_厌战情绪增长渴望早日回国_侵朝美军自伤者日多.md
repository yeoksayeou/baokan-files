Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 28th: After suffering repeated heavy blows from the Korean and Chinese People's forces, an increasing number of soldiers in the American invading army are resorting to self-inflicted wounds to escape the battlefield and preserve their lives. According to Thomson, a former sergeant in the medical company of the U.S. Army 24th Division's Independent 5th Regiment, captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers: "Since February, there have been a great many self-inflicted wounds in our regiment, averaging more than ten people per company. These self-wounded soldiers say: 'As long as I can go home, I am willing to shoot myself twice.'" He said, "When the self-wounded soldiers are being treated, they all ask the same question: 'Should I be able to return home now?'" Hart, the former assistant platoon leader of the 2nd Company of the regiment, confessed that four soldiers in the 1st Company had collectively inflicted self-wounds, hoping to be sent back home together. Private First Class Spark of the 9th Company, 3rd Battalion, 19th Regiment of the division, was captured by the Volunteers after wounding himself with an automatic rifle on April 20th. He described his motivation and process of self-harm, saying: "On April 20th, we spent a lot of effort climbing a mountain. The battle had not yet begun. This brief moment of tranquility before the battle was the time we felt most uneasy. Who knew what their fate would be? I took out the 'Surrender Safety Pass' that you distributed to look at. I can't remember how many times I've looked at it. The more I thought about it, the less willing I was to continue fighting this war. I joined the army to make money, but after being in Korea for almost a year, we were driven by American tycoons to climb around in the mountains, covered with lice, with wrinkles increasing on our faces, and our bodies getting thinner. We can't even save our lives, so what's the point of talking about making money? At twelve o'clock that night, a shell suddenly landed in the sleeping pit of my companion Guess, and he died. I thought he died happily. I wanted to die too. It's better than being tormented all day long. But then I thought that people can only die once, and I still have a family, I want to go home. I touched my automatic rifle and shot myself in the arm with it." After being captured, he was treated kindly by the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Volunteer doctors bandaged his wounds. The translator told him that his arm bone was broken and he would be disabled. He comforted himself, "I am not sad, because I can never participate in this cursed war again."

Sergeant Brigham, however, used another method to injure himself. As soon as he heard gunfire, he lay supine in the sleeping pit, raised his feet high, and soon achieved his goal of getting injured.

This self-inflicted behavior of American soldiers is encouraged by their families. Nannie, the wife of former Sergeant Linquist of the 6th Company, Independent 5th Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, said in a letter sent from the United States on March 1st: "Can anyone get sent home by injuring their arm? ... If you can also be sent back home in that way, I hope you will do it. I know it's terrible, but what can I do to get you home sooner?" Another soldier's father was afraid that his son would be killed or injured too painfully, so he simply wrote to encourage him to surrender. The letter said: "I heard that Chinese grenades are very powerful. As soon as you hear the grenade explode, surrender quickly, or it will be too late."

### 厌战情绪增长渴望早日回国  侵朝美军自伤者日多

　　厌战情绪增长渴望早日回国
    侵朝美军自伤者日多
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】美国侵略军的士兵们在接连遭受朝、中人民部队的沉重打击之后，越来越多地实行自伤，借以脱离战场，保全自己生命。据被中国人民志愿军俘获的前美军第二十四师独立第五团医务连中士汤姆生说：“从二月以来，我们这一团自伤的人非常多，平均每连在十个人以上。这些自伤的人说：‘只要能回家，自己把自己打两枪也愿意。’”他说：“自伤的士兵在医治时都问着同样一句话：‘我该可以回国了吧？’”前该团第二连助理副连长哈特供称：该团第一连曾有四个士兵实行集体自伤，希望被一道送回国去。该师第十九团三营九连的二等兵斯巴克是在四月二十日用自动步枪自伤后被志愿军俘掳的。他叙述他自伤的动机和经过说：“四月二十日，我们费了很大气力爬上了一座山头。战斗还没有开始。这战斗前短暂的宁静时刻，是我们最感不安的时候。谁知道自己的命运会怎么样呢？我掏出你们散发的‘投降安全证’来看。我也记不清楚这是第几次看它了。我越想越不愿意继续打这个仗。我当兵是为了赚钱，可是到朝鲜来快一年了，我们被美国的大亨们赶着在丛山中爬来爬去，身上长满了虱子，脸上增加了一道道的皱纹，身体瘦下去了。我们连命都保不住，还谈什么赚钱呢？就在这天夜晚十二点钟，突然有一颗炮弹落在我的同伴盖斯的睡坑中，他死了。我看他死的倒痛快。我也想死。这比成天受折磨要痛快得多。但是我又想到人只能死一次，我还有家呀，我要回家。我摸了摸我的自动步枪，就用它对着自己的胳膊打了一枪。”他在被俘后受到了中国人民志愿军的宽待。志愿军的医生替他包扎伤口。翻译人员告诉他说，他的臂骨打碎了，要成残废了。他安慰自己说：“我并不悲伤，因为我可以永远不再参加像这种令人诅咒的战争了。”
    上士勃里罕却是用另一种办法把自己弄伤的。他一听到枪声响就仰卧在睡坑里，把双脚高举，不久他就达到了受伤的目的。
    美军士兵们的这种自伤行为受到了他们家属的鼓励。前美军第二十四师独立第五团第六连上士林奎士特的妻子南妮在三月一日从美国寄来的信上说：“打伤自己的臂膀就可以回国，是不是任何人都可以办到呢？……如果你也可以用那种办法被送回国来，我希望你也就这样做。我知道那是可怕的，可是为了要你早日回家，又有什么办法呢？”另一个士兵的父亲怕他儿子被打死或受伤太痛苦，干脆来信鼓励他投降。信中说：“听说中国人的手榴弹很厉害。你一听见手榴弹响，就赶快投降吧，慢了就来不及了。”
