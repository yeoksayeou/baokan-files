(Xinhua News Agency, May 27th) The negotiation process between the plenipotentiary representatives of the Central People's Government and the plenipotentiary representatives of the Tibetan local government regarding the peaceful liberation of Tibet is as follows:

　　When the Central People's Government ordered the People's Liberation Army to advance into Tibet, it notified the Tibetan local government to send representatives to the central government for negotiations in order to conclude an agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Under the influence of the Central People's Government's policy of peaceful liberation of Tibet and its policy of national equality, the Tibetan local government sent Ape Ngawang Jigme, Kheme Sonam Wangdi, Thubten Tenthar, Thubten Lekmon, and Sampo Tenzin Dhondup as plenipotentiary representatives in February of this year, with Ape Ngawang Jigme as the chief representative, to come to the central government for negotiations. Ape Ngawang Jigme, Thubten Lekmon, and Sampo Tenzin Dhondup arrived in Beijing on April 22nd via Qamdo, Kangding, Ya'an, Chongqing, and Xi'an; Kheme Sonam Wangdi and Thubten Tenthar arrived in Beijing on April 26th via India and Hong Kong.

　　After the plenipotentiary representatives of the Tibetan local government gathered in the capital, the Central People's Government immediately appointed Li Weihan, Zhang Jingwu, Zhang Guohua, and Sun Zhiyuan as plenipotentiary representatives, with Li Weihan as the chief representative, and began negotiations with the plenipotentiary representatives of the Tibetan local government on April 29th on a friendly basis. The plenipotentiary representatives of the Central People's Government, based on the Central People's Government's ethnic policy and the actual situation in the Tibetan region, proactively put forward a series of proposals, while also listening to and adopting the constructive opinions of the plenipotentiary representatives of the Tibetan local government as much as possible. Therefore, the negotiations progressed smoothly, and after several consultations, both sides unanimously adopted the "Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." The negotiations between the two sides concluded on the 21st of this month, and the signing ceremony for the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet was held on the 23rd. From then on, the Tibetan ethnic group and the Tibetan people were able to forever escape the enslavement of imperialism, return to the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, enjoy the rights of national equality under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, like the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, develop their own political, economic, and cultural and educational undertakings, and strive to create a happy and prosperous future.

　　关于和平解放西藏的谈判经过
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府全权代表和西藏地方政府全权代表关于和平解放西藏的谈判经过如下：
    中央人民政府于命令人民解放军进军西藏之际，通知西藏地方政府派遣代表来中央举行谈判，以便订立和平解放西藏办法的协议。西藏地方政府在中央人民政府和平解放西藏的方针和民族平等政策的影响下，于今年二月派阿沛·阿旺晋美，凯墨·索安旺堆，土丹旦达，土登列门和桑颇·登增顿珠等五人为全权代表，并以阿沛·阿旺晋美为首席代表，来中央举行谈判。阿沛·阿旺晋美，土登列门和桑颇·登增顿珠等经昌都、康定、雅安、重庆、西安等地，于四月二十二日抵达北京；凯墨·索安旺堆和土丹旦达则转道印度、香港等地，于四月二十六日到达北京。
    西藏地方政府全权代表齐聚首都后，中央人民政府当即指派李维汉、张经武、张国华、孙志远为全权代表，并以李维汉为首席代表，于四月二十九日与西藏地方政府的全权代表，在友好的基础上，开始进行谈判。中央人民政府的全权代表根据中央人民政府的民族政策和西藏地区的实际情况，曾主动地提出了一系列的建议，同时尽量地听取和采纳了西藏地方政府全权代表的建设性的意见。因此，谈判的进展是顺利的，双方先后经过多次洽商，一致通过了“中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”。双方的谈判于本月二十一日结束，二十三日举行了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的签字仪式。从此以后，西藏民族和西藏人民得以永远摆脱帝国主义的奴役，回到中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作的大家庭里来，在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，和各兄弟民族人民一样，共同享受着民族平等的权利，发展自己的政治、经济和文化教育事业，为创造幸福美满的将来而奋斗。
