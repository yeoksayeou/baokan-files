　　After Rent Reduction and Deposit Refunds, Farmers in Jiajiang County, Western Sichuan
    Eagerly Purchase Farm Tools, Leading to Great Development in Industry and Commerce

To the Editor:
    Since the broad masses of farmers in Jiajiang County, Western Sichuan, implemented rent reduction and deposit refunds, their purchasing power has generally increased, thereby stimulating the development of legitimate industry and commerce. The most illustrative example of this is the significant increase in the sales volume of farm tools. In the past, farm tools in the market were unsold, but now they are in short supply. More than 3,000 old farm tools repaired by the wood and iron industries in the city, and more than 2,100 newly made hoes, more than 300 sets of rakes, and more than 250 waterwheels have already been snatched up by the farmers. After the made farm tools were sold out, many farmers began to pre-order farm tools. According to statistics from seventeen townships including Yongxing and Mucheng, there are now plans to pre-order 831 waterwheels, 8,300 hoes, 2,140 waterwheel dragon heads, 440 plowshares, 1,680 harrows, 1,280 waterwheel blades, 1,000 waterwheel tendons, and 110 windmills; in addition, there are thousands of small farm tools such as axes, tobacco hoes, and sickles. The iron and wood industries are working overtime day and night to catch up with production, but still cannot meet the needs of the farmers. The number of wood and iron businesses in the urban area has increased from 22 before liberation to 118. Li Youzhang, the representative of the iron industry, said: "The farmers are getting refunds of deposits and rent reductions from the landlords, and our iron industry is also going to turn over a new leaf."
    Farmers' ability to purchase daily necessities has also improved. Many industries and businesses related to farmers' lives have developed accordingly. For example, in the textile industry, there were only more than 300 households in the entire county before liberation, but now it has increased to 6,181 households. The knitting, towel, and paper industries have also increased significantly. Some industries and businesses that used to deal in urban luxury goods are now shifting their business focus to the countryside. For example, Zhou Weixin of East Street used to deal in high-end general merchandise, but now he deals in homespun cloth, and his business is better than before. Businessmen are full of confidence and say: "Let's work hard, this is just rent reduction and deposit refund, after the implementation of land reform, our business will definitely be better than it is now."

　　川西夹江县农民减租退押后
    纷纷争购农具工商业大发展编辑同志：
    我们川西区夹江县的广大农民在减租退押后，购买力普遍提高了，因而刺激了正当工商业的发展。最能说明这个问题的，是农具的销售量大增。过去市上的农具没人买，现在却是供不应求。城内木铁业补修的三千多件旧农具，和新做成的二千一百多把锄头、三百多付抓钉，二百五十多架水车，早已被农民争购一空。做好的农具被买光了，许多农民们又开始预订农具。据永兴、木城等十七个乡的统计，现已计划预订水车八百三十一架，锄头八千三百把，水车龙头二千一百四十个，铧子四百四十个，耙一千六百八十个，水车叶子一千二百八十张，水车龙筋一千条，风车一百一十架；此外尚有斧头、烟锄、镰刀等小件农具数千件。铁、木业昼夜加班赶制，尚不能满足农民的需要。城区的木、铁业，已由解放前的二十二户增加到一百一十八户。铁业代表李有章说：“农民向地主退押、减租，咱们铁业也要翻身了。”
    农民们购买日用品的能力也提高了。很多与农民生活有关的工商业随着发展起来了。如纺织业，解放前全县只有三百多户，现已增加到六千一百八十一户。针织、毛巾、纸张等业都大有增加。某些经营城市奢侈品的工商业，现在也把经营方针转向农村。如东街周维新原来经营上等百货，现在改营土布，营业情况反比从前好多了。商民们都满有信心地说：“好好地干吧，这还是减租退押呢，等实行土地改革以后，咱们的买卖一定比现在还好。”
