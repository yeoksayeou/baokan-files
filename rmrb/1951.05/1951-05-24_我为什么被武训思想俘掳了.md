　　Why I Was Captivated by the Thought of Wu Xun
    Dai Guangyi
    We watched both parts of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" in one sitting. On the way back to the office from the cinema, we made many comments about "The Life of Wu Xun." Some said, "Wu Xun devoted himself for thirty years and finally built a school, how great!" Some said, "Wu Xun suffered himself, not eating or drinking, begging for education, so worthy of learning!" Some said, "Wu Xun served the people wholeheartedly." Some even started singing Wu Xun's little tune: "You contribute money, I contribute effort, building a free school is effortless…." In short, everyone at the time "admired" and "worshiped" Wu Xun, and no dissenting opinions were heard. This made some comrades who had not seen the movie feel "regret!"
    After reading the critical articles on Wu Xun and the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" by Yang Er and other comrades published in the People's Daily on May 16th, we realized that this movie was "glorifying the feudal rule of the late Qing Dynasty," slandering the peasant revolutionary struggle, slandering Chinese history, and slandering the Chinese nation." This criticism is completely correct. What is there about Wu Xun that should make a communist party member admire and learn from him? Some communist party members have published articles praising Wu Xun, and they should certainly make a self-criticism; people like us, although we have not published articles praising Wu Xun, have indeed been influenced by Wu Xun's thought in our minds, and we should also go through self-criticism to clarify this.
    I believe that the main reason why we worshiped Wu Xun in this way is that our political and theoretical level is too low! We have not possessed the requirements stipulated in the Party Constitution to "strive to improve one's own level of awareness and understand the foundations of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought"; and use this to fight against all wrong viewpoints. Therefore, we were captured by these wrong viewpoints. This shows that every communist party member must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Now, we must enthusiastically participate in the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" to improve our level of awareness. Here, we have already started casually discussing the issue of "The Life of Wu Xun."

### 我为什么被武训思想俘掳了

　　我为什么被武训思想俘掳了
    戴光毅
    我们是把《武训传》电影上下两集一次看完的。当我们从电影院回机关的时候，路上就对《武训传》发表了不少议论。有的说：“武训三十年如一日，终于修成了一个学校，真伟大！”有的说：“武训自己不吃不喝受苦受罪，行乞兴学，真值得学习！”有的说：“武训真是全心全意为人民服务。”还有的因此唱起武训的小曲来：“你出钱，我出力，修个义学不费力……。”总之，当时大家都是“敬佩”和“崇拜”武训的，而没有听到任何相反的意见。并使一些没有看过这个电影的同志因此感到“遗憾！”
    看了五月十六日人民日报上发表了杨耳等同志对武训及《武训传》电影的批判文章以后，我们才知道这部电影是“歌颂清朝末年的封建统治”，污蔑农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史，污蔑中国民族”的。这一批判是完全正确的。武训这样的人有什么可以使共产党员崇拜和学习的呢？有些共产党员把歌颂武训的文章发表了，固然要作检讨；象我们这样的人，虽没有发表歌颂武训的文章，但思想上确实受了武训的影响，同样也该经过检讨澄清一下。
    我认为：我们所以这样崇拜武训，主要是我们的政治水平和理论水平太低！没有具备如党章上所要求的“努力地提高自己的觉悟程度和领会马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础”；并以此来与一切错误的观点进行斗争。因之，被这些错误观点所俘虏。这说明了：每个共产党员都要努力地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。现在，就要热烈地参加关于《武训传》的批判，以提高自己的觉悟程度。在我们这里，已开始漫谈《武训传》的问题了。
