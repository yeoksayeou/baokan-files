　　I am willing to dedicate everything to the motherland
    Pan Lizhou, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University
    There were five people in my family. In the old society, we were economically oppressed and unable to live. I managed to get a job at a private newspaper and a private scholarship in Shanghai, but I had to teach, act, and work hard everywhere to barely make a living and study. Because of overwork, I developed a serious lung disease. But in the old society, not only could I not get proper care, but I was also subjected to even more severe oppression and abuse because of my illness.
    Because I received scholarships from the newspaper and private individuals, I didn't dare to say I was sick at the time. Even when I was coughing up blood, I would hold a cold towel to my head while studying. Why was I so reckless? It was simply because my life was in the hands of others, because those hypocritical gentlemen who gave me the scholarship would not cultivate a sick slave. They stipulated that I had to have a total average score of 85. If I said I was sick or couldn't get 85 points, I would have to drop out of school and starve.
    In middle school, due to the dark rule of the reactionaries, I could not get sympathy or comfort. Those people discriminated against me, calling me a "undying ghost," and sent me to a remote room, only sending me some cold food every day. I suffered all kinds of oppression and abuse. At that time, I hated the world, I lost the will to "live," and I waited for death.
    But I finally persevered and did not die. In 1948, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued me, first of all by giving me physical freedom. No one would torment or oppress me anymore. In the embrace of the motherland, the Party and the Communist Youth League educated me and took care of my health. Now, students with poor health have access to nutritious meals. The Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the school and the Student Union care about us and send representatives to attend meetings to discuss issues related to recuperation. Chairman Mao cares about us even more. A few days ago, he sent comrades from the Ministry of Health to visit us and study our nutritional problems. Now my health has improved. Who liberated me from a life of slavery? Who saved me from illness? I will always remember, it is the Communist Party, it is Chairman Mao, it is the People's Government. Looking back at the time since liberation, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, have overcome disasters, overcome inflation, eliminated bandits, despots, and landlords, and healed the festering wounds left to us by imperialism and reactionaries. Today, farmers have been allocated land and have increased agricultural production. Industry is also booming. In Korea, our volunteers helped the Korean people defeat the military aggression of American imperialism. I have seen the beautiful prospects of the motherland and the happy future of the motherland. I have the will to "live," I want to improve my health, improve my political awareness, master my profession, and prepare to participate in the economic construction and national defense construction of the motherland.
    I love the motherland, I love Chairman Mao, I love the Communist Party. Today I have been reborn. I want to learn the fighting spirit of the "May Fourth" martyrs and am willing to dedicate everything I have to the motherland!

　　我愿意把一切贡献给祖国
    清华大学机械系  潘立宙
    我家五个人，在旧社会受到经济压迫，生活不了。我在上海搞到一个私人报馆和私人的奖学金，一面又要教书演戏四处卖命，才能勉强糊口念书。因为劳苦过度，我得了严重的肺病。可是在旧社会里，我非但得不到适当的调养，而且还因为有了病而受到更厉害的压迫和虐待。
    我因为拿得的是报馆和私人的奖学金，所以当时我就不敢说有病。已经吐血了，还一面用冷毛巾按在头上，一面捧着书本念。为什么这样不要命呢？只是因为生命掌握在别人手里，因为给我奖学金的那班伪善君子是不会培养有病的奴隶的。他们规定我要有总平均八十五分的成绩。如果我说有病或考不到八十五分，那我就得失学，就得挨饿了。
    在中学里，由于反动派黑暗的统治，使我得不到同情和安慰。那些人歧视我，骂我是“死不掉的病鬼”，把我送到一个偏僻的房间，每天只送到一些冷饭菜给我吃。我受尽压迫和虐待，那时我憎恨世间，我丧失了“生”的意志，我等待死亡。
    可是我终于坚持下来了，并没有死。一九四八年共产党和毛主席解救了我，首先是使我得到了身体的自由。没有谁再来摧残我压迫我了。在祖国的怀抱里，党和青年团教育我，又照顾我的健康。现在，体弱同学有了营养膳团。中共校党委会和学生会都关心我们，派代表出席讨论关于养病问题的会。毛主席更关心我们，前几天派了卫生部的同志来访问我们，研究我们的营养问题。现在我的健康已经好转了。是谁从奴役的生活中解放了我？是谁从疾病中救活了我？我要永远记住，是共产党，是毛主席，是人民政府。再看看解放以来，全国人民在党，在毛主席，在人民政府的领导下，克服了灾荒，克服了通货膨胀，肃清了土匪恶霸地主，医好了帝国主义与反动派给我们留下来的烂疮疤。今天，农民分得了土地，提高了农业生产。工业也正在蓬蓬勃勃的发展起来。在朝鲜，我们志愿军帮助朝鲜人民打败了美帝国主义军事侵略。我看到了祖国美丽的远景，看到了祖国幸福的前途。我有了“生”的意志，我要养好身体，提高政治水平，掌握业务，准备参加祖国的经济建设与国防建设。
    我爱祖国，爱毛主席，爱共产党。今天我得到了新生，我要学习“五四”先烈们的奋斗精神，愿意把我的一切贡献给祖国！
