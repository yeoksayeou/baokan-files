On behalf of the lamas of 108 monasteries in the Labrang area, I hope that the lamas of the Tibetan monasteries will not easily believe the rumors created by the imperialists and their lackeys, unite together, assist the Tibetan local government, resolutely smash any conspiracy by the imperialists to obstruct and undermine the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and jointly build a new Tibet.
