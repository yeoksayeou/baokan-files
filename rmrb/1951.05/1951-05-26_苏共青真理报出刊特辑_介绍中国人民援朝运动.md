Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 24th: The Soviet Komsomol Pravda published a special feature on the Chinese people's aid Korea movement on the 23rd, taking up more than half a page. The special feature included the donation figures and letters from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to aid Korean workers, the letter "Sent to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea" published by writer Ding Ling in "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), the letter from Hua Chang, a student participating in the volunteer army's medical work published in "People's China," photos of the meeting between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army published in "People's Pictorial," and other poems and cartoons about resisting America and aiding Korea. Komsomol Pravda pointed out: The aid Korea movement unfolding everywhere in China is a reflection of the sincere friendship of the free Chinese people towards the free Korean people. It shows that the close friendship between the two peoples is unbreakable, and this friendship is growing on the battlefield where blood is shed for a just cause.

Wenxue Bao (Literary Gazette) published an article on the first page on the 22nd written by Wang Yougen, deputy battalion commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a member of the China-Soviet Friendship Association's delegation to the Soviet May Day celebrations, entitled "Why I am Fighting American Aggressors in Korea." In this article, Wang Yougen told Soviet readers how the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is defending world peace by resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting our homes and country.
