　　(II) Supporting the Soviet Proposal for a Japanese Peace Treaty
    Regarding how to conclude a peace treaty with Japan, and what kind of peace treaty to conclude, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, the major countries that fought against Japan, have recently successively expressed more specific attitudes in formal diplomatic documents, clarifying their consistent positions on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. Those documents are: the "American Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" delivered by the US government to the governments of the Soviet Union and other countries in late March, the "Soviet Union's Opinion on the American Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" given by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko to US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kirk on May 7, and the note from Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of China to Soviet Ambassador to China Roshchin on May 22, supporting the Soviet Union's views on the Japanese peace treaty.
    It is very clear from these documents that the attitudes of the Soviet Union and China, which adhere to a policy of peace, and the United States, which adheres to a policy of aggression and war, are fundamentally different on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union and China have consistently advocated that the preparation, drafting, and conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty should be carried out in accordance with previous international agreements and legal procedures. This treaty must be a just and reasonable comprehensive treaty that ensures the revival of Japanese militarism is prevented, an independent and democratic Japan is established, and lasting peace in Asia and the world is guaranteed. In contrast, the United States disregards all international agreements and wants to handle the preparation, drafting, and even signing of the Japanese peace treaty single-handedly. It wants to treat Japan as a colony and enslave the Japanese people, and to use Japan as a tool to expand aggression and enslave the people of Asia and even Australia. What the United States wants to conclude is not a peace treaty, but a war treaty. We have already sternly refuted the absurdity of the US-made "Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty."
    Now, there are essentially two concrete proposals for a Japanese peace treaty: one is the American draft that leads to war, and the other is the Soviet proposal that guarantees peace, which has been supported by China.
    It is obvious: if a peace treaty with Japan is concluded according to the American draft, it would drag Japan into a new war. The United States would devour everything in Japan, Japan would become a complete colony of the United States, Japanese territory would be completely turned into a launching pad for American aggressors, the Japanese people would become cannon fodder for American aggressors, and Japanese property would become munitions for American aggressors. Furthermore, the Japanese militarists who once poisoned the people of Asia and Australia would become the gunners of American aggressors. The countries of Asia and Australia, as well as the Japanese people, would therefore face new threats.
    It is even more obvious: if a peace treaty with Japan is concluded according to the Soviet proposal, this would signify the true end of the state of war between the Allies and Japan. Japan would live in peace and equality with all countries, and the countries of Asia would no longer be threatened by Japanese aggression. As far as Japan is concerned, only by signing a comprehensive treaty with the countries formerly at war, in accordance with the just and reasonable plan proposed by the Soviet Union and supported by China, can Japan avoid becoming a colony occupied by the United States for a long time, guarantee true independence and autonomy, freely develop a peaceful economy, and freely engage in mutually beneficial commerce and trade with other countries. The Japanese people can also avoid being forced into becoming cannon fodder by American aggressors, and thus be able to enter a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous life of happiness and joy.
    The Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's views and proposals, which have been supported by the Chinese government, because they conform to the consistent propositions and demands of the Chinese people. We insist that:
    (1) The People's Republic of China, representing 475 million people, must participate in the Japanese peace treaty. The Chinese people resisted Japanese imperialist aggression for the longest time and suffered the most from Japanese imperialist disasters. It is a matter of course that they have an undeniable say in the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. The People's Republic of China is also a powerful country that carries considerable weight in Asia and even the world today, and is an important pillar in safeguarding peace in the Far East and even world peace. A Japanese peace treaty that guarantees peace in the Far East cannot exclude the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people will never recognize any Japanese peace treaty without the participation of the People's Republic of China.
    (2) The Japanese peace treaty must be a comprehensive treaty that includes all countries that once fought against Japan. This comprehensive treaty should be prepared by the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers that signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, in accordance with international agreements, and representatives of all countries that participated in the war against Japan with military force should participate in the preparatory work, and then a peace conference should be convened to review and sign it. Any so-called unitary treaty handled by one country or not participated in by all countries at war against Japan is illegal and cannot be considered valid.
    (3) Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China. This is not only clearly stipulated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, but has also been confirmed by the facts after the war. The Chinese people will never tolerate the United States' occupation of Taiwan, and Taiwan must be liberated. Other territorial issues related to Japan must also be handled in accordance with existing international agreements, and the United States must not be allowed to usurp and occupy them in any name.
    (4) The treaty must guarantee Japan's true independence and autonomy. The United States plans to continue to station troops in Japan for a long time after the treaty is concluded, under the guise of the "United Nations" and "collective security," especially undermining Japan's independence and autonomy. The US military stationed in Japan, using Japan as a military base for aggressive war, is even more unacceptable to us. Moreover, it must be pointed out that the United States has already used Japan as a war base in fact in the war of aggression against Taiwan and the aggression against Korea. No matter what name the United States uses to continue to station troops in Japan, we firmly oppose it.
    (5) The treaty must ensure that Japanese militarism cannot be revived and that a truly democratic and peaceful Japan is established. The United States is not only using Japan as a war base, but also carrying out large-scale arming of Japan, planning to reorganize Japanese aggressive forces, and acting as cannon fodder for expanding aggressive wars. The United States is also depriving the Japanese people of their democratic rights, persecuting Japanese democratic groups and individuals, while actively supporting Japanese militarists, strengthening the fascist regime, and establishing a wartime system, enslaving and oppressing the Japanese people internally and acting as a tool for American aggression externally. The US-made "Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" does not restrict Japanese arms and does not mention the democratization of Japan. It is intended to revive Japanese militarism and to prevent the establishment of a truly democratic and free Japan. We will never allow the revival of Japanese militarism and will not allow the existence of any organization that deprives the Japanese people of their democratic rights.
    (6) The treaty must guarantee the free development of Japan's peaceful economy and that normal foreign trade and commerce are not restricted. The United States is engaged in military production in Japan, monopolizing Japan's economy and trade, destroying Japan's peaceful economy, and hindering Japan's normal trade, which not only suppresses the lives of the Japanese people, but also harms other Allied countries. The US-made "Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" attempts to continue and strengthen the US monopoly on Japan's economy and trade, which is very obvious. Only by guaranteeing the free development of Japan's peaceful economy and the unrestricted normal trade can mutually beneficial economic relations between Japan and other countries be guaranteed, and the happy lives of the Japanese people can be guaranteed.
    Only by unanimously supporting the plan proposed by the Soviet Union and supported by the Chinese government can the people of China, the countries of Asia and Australia, and the people of Japan strive for a just and reasonable Japanese peace treaty that guarantees lasting peace in the Far East and the stable lives of the people of all countries. At the same time, in order to strive for the rapid conclusion of a just and reasonable Japanese peace treaty based on the Soviet proposal, the people of China, Japan, and the countries of Asia and Australia must more firmly oppose the absurd US-made "Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty."

### （二）支持苏联对日和约建议

　　（二）支持苏联对日和约建议
    关于怎样订立对日和约，及订立什么样的对日和约，对日作战主要国家中，美国、苏联和中国，最近已相继以正式外交文件，表明了更具体的态度，把各自在对日和约问题上的一贯主张，愈益明确地提了出来。那些文件就是：三月下旬美国政府向苏联等各国政府递送的《美国对日和约草案》，五月七日苏联副外交部长波格莫洛夫交给美国驻苏联大使寇克的《苏联关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》，五月二十二日我国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长给苏联驻中国大使罗申关于支持苏联对日和约意见的照会。
    非常明显，从这些文件可以看出，坚持和平政策的苏联和中国，与坚持侵略政策和战争政策的美国之间，在对日和约问题上的态度，是根本不相同的。中苏两国是一贯主张应根据历次国际协议，遵照合法程序筹备、草拟、订立对日和约，这个和约必须是一个公正合理的全面和约，保证日本军国主义不再复活，建立独立和民主的日本，保证亚洲以至世界的持久和平。与此相反，美国蔑视所有国际协议，是要一手包办对日和约的筹备、草拟以至签订，要把日本当做殖民地而奴役日本人民，把日本当做扩大侵略的工具而奴役亚洲以至澳洲各国人民。美国所要订立的不是和平条约，而是战争条约。美制《对日和约草案》的荒谬绝伦，我们已经严正地加以驳斥过了。
    现在，可说有两个对日和约的具体方案：一个就是导向战争的美国草案，一个就是保障和平的苏联建议，这个建议并已为中国所支持。
    显而易见：如果依照美国的草案订立对日和约，那就是把日本拖入新的战争，美国吞噬日本的一切，日本成为美国十足的殖民地，日本的领土将完全变做美国侵略者的炮架子，日本人民变做美国侵略者的炮灰，日本财物变做美国侵略者的炮料，还有，曾经荼毒亚澳人民的日本军国主义分子，则是美国侵略者的炮手。亚洲和澳洲各国以及日本人民，因此将遭遇新的威胁。
    更显而易见：如果依照苏联的建议订立对日和约，这将说明盟国与日本之间的战争状态的真正结束，日本将与各国和平平等相处，亚洲各国不再有遭受日本侵略的威胁。就日本来说，也只有依照苏联所建议而又为中国所支持的公正合理的方案，与过去交战各国签订全面和约，才能免于沦为被美国长期占领的殖民地，才能保障真正的独立与自主，才能自由发展和平经济，才能自由与各国做互利的通商贸易。日本人民也可免于被美国侵略者逼充炮灰，从而得以进入和平、民主与安居乐业、幸福愉快的日子。
    中国人民完全拥护已由中国政府所支持的苏联的意见和建议，因为这符合了中国人民一贯的主张和要求。我们坚持：
    （一）对日和约必须有代表四亿七千五百万人民的中华人民共和国参加。中国人民抵抗日本帝国主义侵略最久，遭受日本帝国主义祸害最深，在对日和约问题上有不可抹杀的发言权，这是天经地义的。中华人民共和国又是今天亚洲以至世界举足轻重的强大的国家，是捍卫远东和平以至世界和平的重要支柱，作为保障远东和平的对日和约，是不可能把中华人民共和国排挤在外的。任何没有中华人民共和国参加的对日和约，中国人民绝不能承认。
    （二）对日和约必须是一个包括所有曾经对日作战的国家的全面和约。这个全面和约应该按照国际协议，由曾经在有关日本投降书上签字的外长会议的会员国中、苏、美、英四国筹拟，并由曾经以武力参加对日作战的各国代表参与筹备工作，然后召开和会审议签订之。任何一个国家包办或不是对日作战全体国家参加的所谓单位和约，都是非法的，不能认为有效。
    （三）台湾和澎湖列岛应归还中国，这不但是开罗宣言和波茨坦公告所明确规定，而且已为战后的事实所确定了的。中国人民绝不能容忍美国强占台湾，台湾一定要解放。其他有关日本的领土问题，也必须依照已有的国际协议处理，不能容许美国以任何名义篡夺霸占。
    （四）和约必须保障日本的真正独立与自主。美国计划于和约订立后假借“联合国”与“集体安全”名义，继续在日本驻军，长期不撤，尤其破坏日本的独立与自主。美国驻军日本，并借此以日本作为从事侵略战争的军事基地，更非我们所能容认。而且必须指出：在侵占台湾及侵略朝鲜的战争中，美国已经在事实上利用了日本作为战争基地。不管美国用什么名义在日本继续驻军，我们都坚决反对。
    （五）和约必须保证日本军国主义不能重新复活，并建立一个真正民主和平的日本。美国不但利用日本作为战争基地，而且进行大规模武装日本，计划重组日本侵略部队，充当扩大侵略战争的炮灰。美国又正一面剥夺日本人民的民主权利，迫害日本民主团体与人士；一面积极扶植日本军国主义分子，加强法西斯政权，并建立战时体制，对内奴役压迫日本人民，对外充当美国侵略的工具。美制《对日和约草案》不限制日本武装，不提日本的民主化，是有意要复活日本军国主义，有意要阻止建立真正民主自由的日本。我们决不能允许日本军国主义的复活，不能允许剥削日本人民民主权利的任何组织的存在。
    （六）和约必须保障日本和平经济的自由发展，及正常的对外通商贸易不受限制。美国在日本搞军事生产，垄断日本的经济和贸易，摧残日本和平经济，阻挠日本正常贸易，不但抑压着日本人民的生活，而且损害着其他盟国。美制《对日和约草案》企图继续并加强美国对日本经济贸易的垄断，甚为明显。只有保障日本和平经济的自由发展与正常贸易的不受限制，才能保证日本与各国间的互利经济关系，保证日本人民的幸福生活。
    中国与亚澳各国人民及日本人民，只有一致拥护苏联所建议、并已为中国政府所支持的方案，才能争取保障远东持久和平与各国人民安定生活的公正合理的对日和约。同时，为争取以苏联建议为基础的公正合理的对日和约的迅速缔结，中国、日本及亚澳各国人民，必须更坚决地反对荒谬绝伦的美制《对日和约草案》。
