　　The Experience of Shanxi's Model Educators' Conference is Worth Promoting
    The Shanxi Province's Model Educators' Conference, held in February this year, exchanged experiences in education work through the process of evaluating models, reviewed the ranks of education workers, and also understood the development of education work in the province. In this way, the bits and pieces of experience from the masses were concentrated, becoming good examples for everyone to learn from and a driving force for further promoting work. At the same time, weaknesses in the work were discovered during discussions and summaries, pointing out the clear direction for everyone's future efforts. This conference has made considerable gains in this regard. The several news reports published in this newspaper today are a part of the typical deeds of the participants of this conference.
    Because most of the model workers who participated in this conference were produced before the large-scale Resist America and Aid Korea movement, this conference failed to systematically discuss and summarize the experience of combining patriotic ideological education of Resist America and Aid Korea with cultural education. Shanxi Province's worker-peasant education, on-the-job cadre education, and school education have already made many achievements and accumulated experiences in this regard; in the future, the form of the Model Educators' Conference should be used in a timely manner to summarize them, and model workers who have done a good job in combining Resist America and Aid Korea ideological education with cultural and scientific education should be rewarded.
    The experience of Shanxi holding the Model Educators' Conference is successful; all regions can adopt the same method, supplement it with the content of patriotic education, and push forward the people's education work.

　　山西召开模范教育工作者大会的经验值得推广
    山西省在今年二月间召开的模范教育工作者大会，通过评比模范的过程，交流了教育工作的经验，检阅了教育工作者的队伍，也了解了全省教育工作发展的情况。这样，把群众中一点一滴的经验都集中了起来，成为大家学习的好榜样，成为进一步推进工作的动力。同时在讨论和总结中也发现了工作中的弱点，指出了大家今后要努力的明确方向。这次会议在这方面是有不小的收获的。今天本报发表的几篇通讯，就是这次会议的参加者的一部分典型的事迹。
    因为参加这次会议的模范工作者大部是在大规模的抗美援朝运动以前产生的，所以这次会议未能把抗美援朝的爱国主义的思想教育与文化教育结合的经验进行系统地讨论和总结。山西省的工农教育、在职干部教育和学校教育中在这方面已有不少成绩和经验；今后应当适时地运用模范教育工作者大会的形式加以总结，并对把抗美援朝思想教育与文化科学教育结合得好的模范工作者给以奖励。
    山西召开模范教育工作者大会的经验是成功的；各地都可采取同样的方法，再充实以爱国主义教育的内容，把人民教育工作推进一步。
