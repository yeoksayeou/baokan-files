The State Council's Financial and Economic Committee Regarding Emergency Directive on Drought Resistance and Cotton Planting

In order to guarantee the realization of the 1951 national cotton production plan and strive for a bumper cotton harvest, the most central and critical key at present depends on whether the cotton sowing task can be completed in a timely manner. Currently, many cotton-growing areas, especially in the north, are experiencing severe drought, which has created extreme difficulties in realizing the cotton planting plan. Therefore, the following emergency directives are issued:

(1) First and foremost, the people's governments at all levels in cotton-growing areas must, with the greatest determination, make cotton planting the primary focus of current rural work, seizing the month before and after the Beginning of Summer (立夏), organizing all forces to lead and assist the masses in a concentrated effort to plant cotton. Various localities should, based on their specific conditions, stipulate cotton planting "assault weeks," "assault periods of ten days," etc., to ensure the victorious completion of the entire cotton planting plan.

(2) The basic link in completing the cotton sowing task is to deeply implement policies, persuade the masses, use historical examples of drought-resistant sowing from various places to educate the masses, establish a firm belief in "man can conquer nature," widely mobilize farmers to organize various forms of mutual aid organizations, and promote the patriotic and creative enthusiasm of farmers to set off a high tide of drought-resistant cotton planting.

(3) In areas where it has not rained, leaders at all levels should grasp different conditions and different methods of drought-resistant sowing, and promptly absorb and exchange experiences to promote comprehensive action, such as extensively opening up all possible water sources, vigorously organizing the rational use of water, making full use of irrigation equipment, and focusing on organizing the digging of earth wells and water pits to implement water transportation for spot planting. In areas with better winter plowing, promote methods such as "borrowing soil moisture and covering with dry soil" (借墒客土) and "plowing dry and planting wet" (耠干耩湿).

Areas that have already received rainfall are also urged to mobilize urgently in accordance with the spirit of this directive, lead the masses to "seize the moisture and rush to plant," and ensure the completion of the cotton planting task.

　　政务院财政经济委员会关于抗旱植棉的紧急指示
    为保证一九五一年全国棉花生产计划的实现和争取棉产丰收，当前最中心的关键决定于棉花播种任务是否能够及时完成。目前许多棉区特别是北方棉区缺雨现象严重，已造成实现植棉计划的极大困难。因此，特紧急指示如下：
    （一）首先棉区各级人民政府必须以最大决心，将植棉工作做为目前农村工作的第一中心，抓紧立夏前后一个月期间，组织所有力量，领导与帮助群众突击植棉。各地应根据当地具体条件，规定植棉突击周、突击旬等，以保证全部植棉计划的胜利完成。
    （二）完成棉花播种任务的基本环节是深入地贯彻政策，说服群众，用历来各地抗旱播种的实例，教育群众，树立坚强的“人定胜天”思想，广泛的发动农民组织各种形式的互助组织，发扬农民爱国的积极创造性，掀起一个抗旱植棉运动的高潮。
    （三）凡未落雨地区，各级领导应掌握不同条件，不同的抗旱播种方法，及时吸取与交流经验，以推动全面，如广泛开辟一切可能利用的水源，大力组织合理使水，充分利用灌溉设备，并着重组织挖土井、水坑，实行运水点种。在冬耕较好地区，提倡“借墒客土”“耠干耩湿”等办法。
    目前已降雨地区，亦希本此指示精神紧急动员起来，领导群众进行“乘墒抢种”，保证完成植棉任务。
          主任  陈云
              一九五一年五月一日
