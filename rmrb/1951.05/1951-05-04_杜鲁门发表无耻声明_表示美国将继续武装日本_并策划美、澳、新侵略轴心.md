　　Truman Issues Shameless Statement
    Declares US Will Continue to Arm Japan and Plans US-Australia-New Zealand Aggression Axis
    [Report from our newspaper] Xinhua News Agency reports: US President Truman issued a so-called "Statement Regarding the US Attitude Towards Pacific Security" on April 18th, reiterating the already signed US-Philippines agreement and expressing his willingness to conclude a so-called security agreement with Australia and New Zealand. He attempts to eliminate the dissatisfaction and doubts of the people and ruling groups of these countries caused by the US stepping up its separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, and to further expand US aggressive forces in the Southwest Pacific.
    In the statement, Truman said that after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, US troops will "remain in and near Japan. The United States now has troops stationed in the Ryukyus, especially Okinawa, and hopes to continue to station troops in these areas." Truman said these words originally to give its vassal states a so-called "sense of security," but it exposed one of the despicable purposes of the US's separate peace treaty with Japan, which is to allow US troops to be stationed indefinitely in and near the Japanese mainland, threatening the security of the Far East countries.
    Truman announced that he had appointed the US Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and his special representative Dulles to continue discussions with the governments of Australia and New Zealand to conclude an agreement that would stipulate that when any of the three countries enters a state of war, "each of the three countries will take action, in accordance with their constitutional procedures, to deal with the common danger." According to a United Press Washington dispatch on April 18th, this is "a guarantee somewhere between a 'paper guarantee' and the broad guarantees of the North Atlantic Treaty." People can see from the example of the notorious North Atlantic Treaty that the US-Australia-New Zealand tripartite agreement that the United States is planning is by no means a "security guarantee" for the two countries, but a new rope that attempts to be placed around the necks of the people of the two countries, and another sinister plan to drive the two countries to act as US aggressive tools. In fact, even before this agreement was concluded, according to a United Press dispatch on April 20th, the United States had already asked Australia and New Zealand to strengthen their own "defense forces" as a "prelude" to the tripartite agreement.
    Britain expressed very mixed emotions about the new move of the US's further extension of its power into the Australian and New Zealand Dominions. British Foreign Secretary Morrison, in a statement in the House of Commons on April 19th, expressed "welcome" to the US decision on the one hand; but when answering whether Britain was "included in the proposed agreement," he said helplessly: "We are indeed a Pacific country, and we would not be unwelcome if we were included in the proposed agreement. But, so far, the result of the discussion is not like this." According to an Agence France-Presse London dispatch, some people in Britain believe that: "The fact that Australia and New Zealand are negotiating with the United States to conclude a security agreement without the participation of Britain has ominous significance."
    In Australia, although Foreign Minister Spender expressed "very satisfaction" with Truman's statement on April 19th, the opinions within the Australian bourgeoisie are also equally inconsistent. Former Australian Foreign Minister and Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, Evatt, said on the same day when commenting on the proposed "Pacific Pact": "It is ridiculous to call the proposed pact a great boon for Australia."

　　杜鲁门发表无耻声明
    表示美国将继续武装日本  并策划美、澳、新侵略轴心
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国总统杜鲁门于四月十八日发表了所谓《关于美国对太平洋安全的态度》的声明，重申已经签订的美菲协定，并表示愿与澳大利亚、新西兰订立所谓安全协定，企图借以消除由于美国加紧单独对日媾和和重新武装日本所引起的各该国人民的不满和统治集团的疑虑，并进一步扩张美国在西南太平洋的侵略势力。
    杜鲁门在声明中说，在缔结对日和约后，美国军队将“留驻日本国内和附近。美国现在琉球，特别是冲绳驻有军队，并希望继续在这些地方驻军”。杜鲁门说这些话原是想使它的附庸国家发生所谓“安全感”，但却暴露了美国单独对日媾和的卑鄙的目的之一，就是要使美军无限期地驻在日本本岛及其附近，威胁远东各国的安全。
    杜鲁门宣布他已任命美国国务卿、国防部长及其特别代表杜勒斯与澳大利亚和新西兰两国政府继续商谈缔结一种协定，这一协定将规定，当三国中的任何一国进入战争状态时，“三国的每一个都将依照它们的宪法程序，采取行动，对付共同的危险”。据合众社华盛顿十八日电称，这是“介乎‘纸上保证’与北大西洋公约广泛保证之间的一种保证”。人们从恶名昭彰的北大西洋公约的实例中可以知道，美国正在策划的美澳新三国协定，决不是对两国的什么“安全保证”，而是企图套在两国人民颈上的新的绳索，是企图驱策两国充当美国侵略工具的又一阴险计划。事实上，甚至在这一协定订立之前，据合众社四月二十日电称，美国已要求澳大利亚与新西兰增强它们自己的“防御力量”，作为三国协定的“序幕”。
    英国对于美国势力进一步伸入澳、新两自治领的新行动，表示了十分混杂的情绪。英国外相莫里逊四月十九日在下院发表的声明中，一面对美国的决定表示“欢迎”；但在回答英国是否“被包括在拟议中的协定中时”，他又无可奈何地说：“我们的确是一个太平洋国家，而且如果我们被包括在拟议中的协定中，我们不是不欢迎的。但是，到现在为止，讨论的结果不是这样。”据法新社伦敦电，英国有一些人认为：“澳大利亚与新西兰要和美国谈判，缔结没有英国参加的安全公约的事实，有不祥的意义。”
    在澳大利亚，虽然外长斯宾德于四月十九日表示对杜鲁门的声明“非常满意”，但是，澳大利亚资产阶级内部的意见也是同样的不统一。前澳外长、工党副领袖伊瓦特同日在评论拟议中的《太平洋公约》时就说：“若称拟议中的公约为澳大利亚的一件莫大的幸事，真是无聊得很。”
