    Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory

    After Counter-Revolutionary Zhang Juxin's Arrest
    Workers Actively Produce, Continuously Setting New Records

To the Editor:

For more than two years since liberation, the workers of Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory have enjoyed freedom and democracy, and their lives have been guaranteed. However, one thing still makes the workers feel that they have not completely turned over, and everyone says: "Everything is good now, but the bastards who helped the Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek to harm us are still doing well as before. This makes people feel uncomfortable." It turns out that the bastards who oppressed the workers before liberation are still unwilling to bow their heads to the workers after liberation. For example, Zhang Juxin, the "Labor Section Chief" during the Japanese occupation, once beat more than 200 workers including Yao Zuopu, Qi Zhen, and Sun Xichao, withheld workers' wages, privately established a "court," interrogated workers, and grabbed "laborers" for the Japanese invaders, and seized workers' wives and daughters. Such a heinous counter-revolutionary element has not been sanctioned by the people after liberation, and is still doing evil in the factory,打击打击工人的生产情绪. When the factory improved the operating procedures, everyone was very confident, but he said: "What's so good about this? It's learned from the Soviet Union again. I don't think I'll ever understand it!" He incited others to be passive and slack off, and he said: "Give as much salary as you work." For more than two years after liberation, the workers were not convinced that Zhang Juxin had not been dealt with appropriately.

Since the promulgation of the Regulations on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, the workers could no longer suppress their grievances and expressed their opinions one after another. The Qinhuangdao Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau accepted the workers' request and arrested Zhang Juxin. All the workers in the factory immediately became active. Workshops held accusation meetings to expose Zhang Juxin's crimes. Zhang He and Gao Hong, who had been captured by Zhang Juxin as laborers, said: "The hatred that has been held in my stomach for seven or eight years can finally be vented." When the workers met, they said: "When I think of the suffering of eating cornmeal, my heart still hurts. Zhang Juxin should be shot!" Sun Jimin, a worker in the box-making department, bought five catties of pork to celebrate the arrest of the counter-revolutionary element, and the whole family had a good meal.

Since the arrest of the counter-revolutionary elements, the workers' morale has changed significantly, and production performance has improved significantly. For example, glass cutter Li Wenlin cut 64 standard boxes of 2mm glass in one day on April 18th, and Zhao Xueqin cut 72 standard boxes on the 19th, and Li Wenlin cut 81 standard boxes on the 20th. This is an unprecedented record. Since liberation, in several labor competitions, no more than 51 standard boxes have been exceeded. The box-making workshop also showed the same amazing results, completing the monthly task of 53,000 standard boxes seven days ahead of schedule on April 23. After the arrest of the chief culprit, reporting hidden bad elements has become a mass movement, and Kuomintang, Sanmin Youth League members and other counter-revolutionary elements who have not registered themselves can no longer hide. Recently, 36 counter-revolutionary elements in our factory surrendered themselves. At present, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the continued deepening of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea are being carried out in our factory in depth. The workers smiled when they met and said: "This is truly liberation."

### 秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂  反革命分子张聚鑫就捕后  工人积极生产连创新纪录

　　秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂
    反革命分子张聚鑫就捕后
    工人积极生产连创新纪录编辑同志：
    解放二年多的秦皇岛市耀华玻璃厂工人，有了自由民主，生活上也有了保障，但是还有一件事使工人们老觉得没有澈底翻身，大伙都说：“现在啥都好，就是帮助日本鬼子和蒋介石坑害咱们的坏蛋还是像从前一样吃得开，这叫人心里不舒服。”原来解放前欺压工人的坏蛋，解放后仍不肯向工人低头。例如日寇时代的“劳务系主任”张聚鑫曾殴打过工人姚作普、齐珍、孙喜朝等二百余人，扣留工人工资，私立“公堂”，刑审工人，替日寇抓“劳工”，霸占工人的妻女。这样罪大恶极的反革命分子，解放后仍没有受到人民的制裁，还在厂里为非作歹，打击工人的生产情绪。厂里改进操作规程时，大家信心很高，他却说：“这有啥好呢？又是从苏联学来的，我算这辈子也搞不通！”他鼓动别人消极怠工，他说：“给多少薪金就干多少活。”解放后二年多对张聚鑫这种人没有适当处理，工人们都不服气。
    自从镇压反革命条例公布以后，工人们满肚子怨气再也压不住了，纷纷提出意见。秦皇岛市人民政府公安局接受了工人的要求，逮捕了张聚鑫。全厂的工人立刻活跃起来了。各车间召开控诉会，揭发了张聚鑫的罪恶。曾被张聚鑫抓作劳工的张和与高宏说：“蹩在肚子七、八年的仇恨，这回可要吐吐了。”工人们见面就说：“想起吃玉黍面苦来，现在心里还痛，应该枪毙了张聚鑫！”造箱部工友孙击民为了庆贺逮捕反革命分子，买了五斤猪肉，全家吃了一顿好饭。
    自从反革命分子被捕以后，工人情绪显著改变了，生产成绩显著提高。如玻璃切手李文林，在四月十八一天内切出了二毫米玻璃六十四标准箱，十九日赵学勤便切出了七十二标准箱，二十日李文林又切出了八十一标准箱。这是空前的纪录。解放以后，在几次劳动竞赛运动中，没有超过五十一标准箱的。造箱场也表现了同样惊人的成绩，四月二十三日提前七天胜利地完成了全月五万三千个标准箱的任务。逮捕了首恶分子后，检举暗藏的坏分子已经成为群众性运动，尚未自首登记的国民党、三青团分子及其他反革命分子也再隐蔽不住了。最近我厂反革命分子自首的就达三十六人。现在镇压反革命和继续深入抗美援朝运动，正在我厂深入开展着。工人们见面便笑着说：“这才叫真正解放了”。
