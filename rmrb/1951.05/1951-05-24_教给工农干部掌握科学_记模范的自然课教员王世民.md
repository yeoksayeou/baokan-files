Teaching Science to Worker-Peasant Cadres
    —A Record of Model Natural Science Teacher Wang Shimin
    Du Ting
    The students at the Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School are mostly cadres from peasant backgrounds. They possess valuable practical work experience and a strong aptitude for understanding science. Comrade Wang Shimin grasps this characteristic, frequently interacting with the students, learning from them, and understanding their learning interests, comprehension abilities, and practical lives. This allows him to connect his lectures to the students' actual lives, enabling them to grasp concepts more profoundly. In summary: In teaching, he acts as both a teacher and a student, closely linked to practical reality.

    Many natural science teachers find it difficult to integrate political and ideological education into cultural subjects. Comrade Wang Shimin excels in this aspect. When explaining the text, he helps students initially establish a dialectical materialist worldview. For instance, when discussing the changes in water, he explains that matter changes according to certain laws of development. As long as humanity can grasp the laws of natural development, it can utilize nature and create things beneficial to human life. Here, he introduced how Soviet scientists researched the causes of rain formation, invented artificial rain, and transformed nature. He also illustrated how the socialist Soviet Union utilized atomic energy to transform nature, turning barren mountains into fertile fields, while American imperialists used atomic energy as a tool for killing, attempting to turn humanity's fertile fields into wastelands. This not only encourages students to learn from and love the Soviet Union but also instills in them a hatred for American imperialism, recognizing American imperialism as the mortal enemy of peace-loving people worldwide, establishing patriotism and internationalism. When discussing digestive organs, he introduced the great achievements of Soviet scientist Pavlov, explaining that the greatness of scientists lies in their service to the interests of humanity.

    Initially, everyone lacked interest in natural science. Given the country's financial difficulties and the school's incomplete facilities, only one or two students could be nominated to conduct experiments. For example, when experimenting with carbon dioxide, everyone nominated Wang Yuchou, who was good at asking questions, and Mi Ronggui, who had a strong ability to learn. Wang Yuchou was skeptical about carbon dioxide's ability to extinguish fire. After Comrade Wang Shimin led everyone in an experiment, the results were excellent. Wang Yuchou said frankly, "In the past, I saw nature as very mysterious and difficult to understand. After listening, it was just the teacher talking, and I was listening. Learning it was useless. Now I know how rich the treasures of nature are; even a puff of gas is useful. By gradually learning something, we can create good things." After such demonstrations, students liked and requested to experiment.

    To conduct natural science teaching, especially biological teaching, specimens are very important, but the school lacked specimens. Comrade Wang Shimin tried various ways to overcome the material shortages, personally leading students to collect specimens. The first time he led students to collect specimens in the suburbs of Taiyuan, everyone was somewhat uninterested, feeling that collecting some stones, flowers, grass, and branches was useless. He made boxes to organize the collected specimens, classified them, and brought them to the classroom to lecture in conjunction with the text. The students realized that specimens greatly helped in learning about nature. Later, they even brought him scorpions caught in the middle of the night in the summer. Whether in biology or physics and chemistry, through his inspiration, the students' experimental interest was very high. Over the past year, under the leadership of the school, through the efforts of the students, the students of Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School have personally created seventeen kinds of plant specimens, forty-six kinds of animal specimens, twenty-seven kinds of mineral specimens, fifteen kinds of specimens related to human bones, internal organs, and blood, a carbide lamp, six mineral radios, and a windmill. At the same time, the achievement of these results also proves that the old society's ruling class, who said that workers and peasants could not learn culture and could not master science, was completely wrong and reactionary.

　　教给工农干部掌握科学
    ——记模范的自然课教员王世民
    杜汀
    山西工农速成中学的学生大部分是农民出身的干部。他们有很多宝贵的实际工作经验，对于科学的理解力强。王世民同志抓住这个特点，经常和同学们在一起，向他们学习，并且了解学生的学习兴趣，接受能力和实际生活，以便自己在讲课时，和学生的实际生活联系起来，使学生们领会得比较深刻。总起来说：教学上，他当先生，也当学生，和实际紧密联系着。
    教学上，将政治思想教育结合到文化课中进行，自然科的许多教员，都感到很困难。王世民同志在这方面做得比较出色。他在讲解课文时，使学生们初步树立辩证唯物论的宇宙观。例如讲到水的变化时，说明物质是按一定的发展规律变化的，只要人类能掌握自然发展的规律，就能利用自然，就能创造出对于人类生活有益的东西。这里，他介绍了苏联科学家们研究雨形成的原因，发明了人造雨，改造了大自然。也说明了社会主义国家的苏联利用原子能来改造自然，把荒山变成良田，美帝国主义把原子能作为杀人的工具，想将人类的良田变成荒原。这样一方面诱导同学学习苏联，爱苏联，另一方面使同学们仇视美帝国主义，认识美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌，树立爱国主义和国际主义的思想。在讲到消化器官时，他介绍了苏联科学家巴甫洛夫的伟大成就，说明科学家伟大的地方在于他是为了人类的利益服务。
    开始大家对自然课不感兴趣。在国家财经困难，学校设备还不完全的情况下，开始只能由同学们推选一个两个同学作实验。例如实验碳酸气，大家就推选好提问题的王玉丑，和接受能力较强的米荣贵来实验。王玉丑对碳酸气能灭火发生怀疑，经过王世民同志领导大家实验后，效果很好。王玉丑很爽直地说：“从前我把自然看得很神秘，不容易了解。听过后，也不过是老师讲讲，我听听罢了。学下也没有用。现在才知道自然界宝藏是多么丰富了，连一股气都有用，慢慢学会些东西，可要创造出好东西哩。”经过这样示范，同学们喜欢和要求实验了。
    要进行自然教学，尤其是生物教学，标本是很重要的东西，然而，学校没有标本。王世民同志想种种办法克服物质缺乏的困难，自己带领同学去采集标本。第一次带领学生们到太原市郊采集标本时，大家都有些不感兴趣，觉得采些石头块块、花草、树枝，有啥用处呢？他将采集来的标本制作装盒，分好类，拿到课堂上结合课文讲，同学们知道了标本对学习自然的帮助很大。以后在夏天的半夜里，捉到蝎子，也给他送来。不论在生物学上、理化上，经过他的启发，同学们的实验兴趣很高。一年来，在学校领导下，经过同学们的努力，山西工农速成中学的同学们已经亲手制作出十七种植物标本，四十六种动物标本，二十七种矿物标本，十五种关于人体骨骼、内脏血液的标本，一盏电石灯，六架矿石收音机，一架风车。同时这些成绩的获得也证明了：旧社会的统治阶级说工人和农民不能学习文化、不能掌握科学，是完全错误的，反动的。
