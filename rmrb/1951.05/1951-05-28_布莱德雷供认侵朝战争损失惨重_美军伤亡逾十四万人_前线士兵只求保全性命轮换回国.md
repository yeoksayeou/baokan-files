　　Bradley Admits Heavy Losses in War of Aggression Against Korea
    US Military Casualties Exceed 140,000
    Frontline Soldiers Only Seek to Preserve Life and Rotate Back Home
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 26th] Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, revealed that the total number of US military casualties in the war of aggression against Korea has exceeded 140,000. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, May 24th, a senator who requested anonymity claimed that, according to Bradley's testimony in a joint session of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, the total number of US military casualties in Korea has reached 141,955. Agence France-Presse leaked the true situation of US military casualties in Korea, which the US Department of Defense is trying hard to conceal, stating that the recent statistics released by the US Department of Defense said that the US military losses in actual combat in Korea were only 60,816. "It is pointed out that official statistics usually lag behind the facts, because the number of casualties that have not been notified to immediate family members are not included in the statistics."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 27th] A Tokyo dispatch published by "The New York Times" on the 20th revealed the low morale of the US military in the war of aggression against Korea.

    The dispatch said: "For American soldiers, the most important thing is how to save their lives in this war and wait to be rotated back home. When our soldiers chat, they talk about when they can be rotated back home."
    The dispatch said: In order to maintain morale and prevent them from "completely falling into depression," the American aggressors decided to adopt a method of rotating them back home. However, the dispatch admitted: Those who are rotated back have "a kind of feeling of being free from danger. They feel that from now on, it is the turn of the replacements to worry about the Chinese."
    The dispatch said: Another method is to distort the situation or completely block outside news. The dispatch admitted: "Our soldiers are almost completely isolated from current news. Even the late news they see has been deleted and distorted."

　　布莱德雷供认侵朝战争损失惨重
    美军伤亡逾十四万人
    前线士兵只求保全性命轮换回国
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷透露，侵朝美军伤亡总数已超过十四万人。据法新社华盛顿二十四日电称，一位不愿发表姓名的参议员宣称，根据布莱德雷在参院军委会和外委会联席会议中的证词，美军在朝伤亡总数已达十四万一千九百五十五人。法新社泄露了美国国防部极力掩饰在朝美军伤亡的真实情况称，最近，美国国防部发表的统计说，朝鲜美军在实际战斗中的损失只有六万零八百十六人，“据指出，官方统计通常是落在事实后面的，因为，凡未通知直系亲属的伤亡人数，便不列入是项统计之中”。
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】《纽约时报》二十日发表的东京通讯，透露侵朝美军士气低沉。
    通讯说：“对于美国士兵来说，最主要的一点是怎样在这次战争中保住自己的性命，等到轮换回国。我们的士兵闲谈时，开口闭口都是谈什么时候可以轮换回国。”
    通讯说：美国侵略者为了保持士气，免使他们“完全消沉下去”，决定采取轮换回国的办法。但通讯承认：得到轮换的人都存在着“一种算是脱了身的情绪。他们觉得，从现在起，该轮到接防的人来提心吊胆地提防中国人了”。
    通讯说：另一个方法是歪曲情况或完全封锁外界的新闻。通讯承认：“我们的士兵差不多完全与当前的新闻隔绝。甚至他们所看到的迟到的新闻也都是被删减歪曲了的。”
