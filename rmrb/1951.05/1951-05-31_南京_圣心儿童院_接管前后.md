　　Before and After the Takeover of the Nanjing "Sacred Heart Children's Home"
    Jing Zhi
    On the afternoon of April 22nd, over 30,000 people in Nanjing held a conference in the square in front of the Catholic "Sacred Heart Children's Home" to denounce the imperialist elements' atrocities against Chinese children. The mothers of countless children, workers, students, religious figures, and hundreds of Buddhists flocked here with heavy hearts. On the left side of the venue, people saw the ribs, skull with hair, and complete corpses of more than 120 children, and this was just from one cave. Some of the corpses were tied together in pairs; some had their hands and feet bound tightly with rope, obviously buried alive before they had even died. Old women constantly wiped away tears and sniffed; mothers whose own children had been buried in this demon's lair were even more inconsolable.

    The "Sacred Heart Children's Home" was opened in 1937 by imperialist elements within the Catholic Church. Here, the doors were locked all year round, and people could only occasionally see foreign nuns with long, trailing skirts and black headscarves covering their faces entering and leaving from the back side door.

    The children placed here paid a monthly fee of five dou of high-quality rice, two jin of white sugar, and a bar of soap, but their living conditions were unimaginably poor. Six infants aged one to three months shared a total of four pounds of milk with the cream removed daily—because the nuns needed the cream for nutrition. Older children were fed rice with vegetable soup every day, and the rice was moldy and smelly. The children were all skin and bones, with dull eyes and withered limbs. Several children were on the verge of blindness due to malnutrition. Many children could not walk at the age of three, or laugh at the age of two. Infants under the age of one were left unattended in bed all day long, their bottoms ulcerated and covered in bumps. Infectious diseases such as impetigo, eczema, trachoma, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis affected each child with at least two types, and up to nine in many cases. The nannies had no knowledge of hygiene or childcare. Even the "doctors" who were unqualified as nurses prescribed prescriptions randomly. The children were not treated in time when they were sick, with the excuse of letting the children ascend to "heaven" early. The "sacred heart" and "compassion" of the imperialist elements caused a large number of child deaths. According to the orphanage's statistics, the child mortality rate was as high as 66 percent (and actually, it was definitely more than this number).

    The spiritual abuse they inflicted on the children was even more appalling. They made the innocent children say prayers before sleeping, make the sign of the cross before eating, and recite scriptures in the morning; they also deceived the children by telling them there were "devils." Six-year-old children had never been outside the gate. If the children were slightly disobedient, they were beaten and scolded, or forced to sit in the dark basement for "solitary confinement." The children would tremble all over as soon as they saw the "嬷嬷" (nuns) glaring at them. This was simply a children's prison!

    The fact that foreign nuns at the "Sacred Heart Children's Home" were abusing and killing Chinese children was exposed in May of last year when a foster girl named Liu Beibei was scalded to death. The injured parents filed lawsuits one after another, demanding that the government severely punish the perpetrators. After careful investigation, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government sentenced the院长 Lanyide (an Irish nun) and the nursery负责人 Hua Ande (a French nun) to six months in prison, suspended for one year, and deported them in February of this year. On April 18th, the Nanjing Military Control Commission announced the takeover of the orphanage.

    Lanyide and Hua Ande, two insidious and vicious imperialist elements, were escorted away from the "Sacred Heart Children's Home" amidst the people's contempt and accusations. When the Nanjing branch of the Relief Administration was ordered to take over, the remaining seven imperialist elements, including Bai Jiezhen, refused to hand over documents and files, and slandered our takeover personnel as "devils," instigating the children not to approach them, in an attempt to create difficulties for our takeover work. It was not until our People's Government exerted pressure and the Chinese staff members of the orphanage, such as Wang Hongbo, led the takeover personnel to excavate the children's bodies that Bai Jiezhen and others hastily packed up their spring beds and coffee pots and left in a panic.

    Fifty-seven dying children returned to the embrace of the motherland. The takeover staff members were busy bathing, cutting hair, and trimming nails for the children, giving fish liver oil to the children whose eyes were about to go blind, and sending the children whose heads were rotten to the bone to the hospital. The smelly and dirty sheets were all washed white. The small kitchen that the nuns used for themselves in the past—filled with canned goods and eggs—has now become a nutrition room for the children. In recent days, people from all walks of life in Nanjing have donated thousands of eggs, and elementary school students have also donated a large amount of milk powder and biscuits.

    At the condemnation meeting, Bao Jingyi's parents wanted to demand blood for the two and a half lives from the imperialist elements. He said: "Imperialism only hopes that Chinese children die, does not want children to have a motherland, and even less wants our motherland to have a beautiful future. As long as they exist for one day, the safety of the motherland and the children will be threatened." Catholics expressed their intention to eliminate these scum in the religious circles. People shouted angrily: "Revenge for the dead children!" "Rescue the children!" "Always remember the hatred of imperialism harming Chinese children!"

　　南京“圣心儿童院”接管前后
    净植
    四月二十二日下午，南京市三万余人在天主教“圣心儿童院”前广场上，举行了控诉帝国主义分子残害中国儿童大会。千万个孩子的母亲和工人、学生、宗教界人士以及上百的佛教徒们，都怀着沉重的心情，涌向这里。在会场的左侧，人们看到了一百二十多个孩子们的肋骨、连着发的头盖骨和整具的尸体，而这仅仅是从一个洞穴里挖掘出来的。尸体有的两个捆在一起；有些用绳子缚紧了手脚，显然是孩子们还没有断气时就被活埋掉的。老太婆们不断地揩抹着眼泪，丢着鼻涕；自己的孩子葬送在这魔窟里的母亲们，更是泣不成声。
    “圣心儿童院”是在一九三七年，由天主教内的帝国主义分子开办的。这里终年重门深锁，人们只能间或从后侧门看到几个长裙曳地，用黑头巾遮住面孔的外籍修女出入。
    寄养在这里的孩子们，每月缴纳了五斗上熟米和两斤白糖、一条肥皂的费用，而生活却出乎想像的恶劣。六个一至三个月的婴孩，每天共有四磅取去奶油的奶水——因为修女们需要奶油营养。稍大的孩子每天用青菜汤下饭，而且米是霉臭的。孩子们个个骨瘦如柴，目光黯淡，四肢干瘪。几个孩子因营养不良，眼睛快要失明了。不少孩子三岁不会走，两岁不会笑。一岁以下的孩子，终日睡在床上没人管，屁股溃烂，满身长着疙瘩。水疮、湿疹、痧眼、肺结核、肺炎、肠胃炎等传染病，每个孩子至少染有二种，多的达九种。保姆没有卫生、保育常识。连护士也不够格的“医生”却在胡乱开处方。孩子们有病迟迟不治，说让孩子早升“天堂”。帝国主义分子的“圣心”和“慈爱”，造成了儿童大量的死亡，据该院统计，儿童死亡率竟高达百分之六十六（实际当不止此数）。
    他们给孩子们精神上的虐待就更令人发指。叫天真的孩子睡觉做祷告，吃饭画十字，早上念经；还骗孩子说有“魔鬼”。六岁的孩子从不曾出过大门。孩子稍不听话。就打就骂，或坐在黑洞洞的地下室里被罚“关禁闭”。孩子们只要一看到“嬷嬷”（修女）瞪眼睛，全身吓得发抖。这简直是一座孩子牢狱！
    “圣心儿童院”外籍修女虐杀中国儿童的事实，在去年五月由于寄养女孩柳贝贝被烫死而揭发出来。受害家长纷纷提出控诉，要求政府严惩凶手。南京市人民政府经周密调查后，于今年二月间判处该院院长兰义德（爱尔兰籍修女）及托儿所负责人华安德（法籍修女）徒刑六个月，缓刑一年，并驱逐出境。四月十八日，南京市军事管制委员会宣布接管该院。
    兰义德、华安德这两名阴险恶毒的帝国主义分子，在人民的唾弃和指斥下被押解离开了“圣心儿童院”。当我救济总会南京分会奉命进行接管时，残留该院的帝国主义分子白洁贞等七人竟拒不交出文件档案，并诬蔑我接管人员为“魔鬼”，唆使孩子们不与接近，企图制造我们接管工作上的困难。直到我人民政府施以压力，同时该院中国籍工作人员王洪波等带领接管人员挖掘孩子们的尸体时，白洁贞等才慌忙收拾起弹簧床、咖啡壶，狼狈离去。
    五十七名奄奄一息的孩子回到了祖国的怀抱。接管工作人员忙着给孩子们洗澡，理发，修指甲，给眼睛快瞎的孩子滴鱼肝油精，把头顶烂到见骨的孩子送进了医院。又臭又脏的小床单全洗得洁白。过去修女们自用的小厨房——那里堆满罐头、鸡蛋，如今成了孩子们的营养室。连日来南京市各界人民又捐赠了数千枚鸡蛋，小学生们也赠送了大批奶粉和饼干。
    控诉会上鲍靓仪家长要向帝国主义分子索还两条半人命的血债。他说：“帝国主义只希望中国的孩子们死，不愿孩子们有祖国，更不愿我们祖国有美丽的将来。他们存在一天，祖国和孩子的安全就受到威胁。”天主教人士表示要清除这些宗教界的败类。人们愤怒地喊着：“为死难的孩子复仇！”“抢救孩子！”“永远记住帝国主义残害中国儿童的仇恨！”
