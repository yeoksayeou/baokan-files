The process by which the Qilizao Township Branch of the CCP Subei Yancheng District Taibei County established its propaganda network began during the peaceful signature campaign in September of last year. At that time, repeated ideological mobilization was carried out from within the Party to outside the Party, and from the branch to the小组 [xiǎozǔ - group/team]. Afterwards, it was consolidated and developed in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and enlistment, and is now gradually becoming regularized. All nineteen propagandists in the township generally believe that "it is an honor to be a Party propagandist."

At the initial stage of establishing the propaganda network, the branch's guiding ideology was unclear. For example, the branch secretary believed that "establishing a propaganda network is a matter for the branch propaganda committee member." However, the branch propaganda committee member did not recognize the importance of the propaganda network and only had a simple task-oriented view, hastily stipulating that each village (the township has five administrative villages) should develop three propagandists; however, Communist Party members were unwilling to serve as propagandists. The selection of propagandists was also not careful, and even the loafer Gu Chunsheng was developed as a propagandist, which caused the masses to show contempt for the establishment of the propaganda network, reflecting that "establishing a propaganda network is just organizing loafers." Communist Party cadres, some believed that "there are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, no propagandists are needed." Others believed that "we can still complete tasks without propagandists." "Now tasks are coming one after another, and now we have to establish a propaganda network, where will we find the time?" The masses who had already become propagandists had ideological concerns, fearing that it would delay production, fearing that they would have to take the lead in everything, and some also feared that there would be no materials for propaganda, so their morale was not high.

Based on the above ideological situation, the township branch held meetings of Party member cadres, joint branch meetings of Party members and League members, meetings of propagandists and mass representatives, and village meetings of the five administrative villages, to study the Central Committee's decision on establishing propaganda network work in light of the local actual situation, using a combination of various meetings and individual chats to gradually and deeply break through the thinking of cadres and Party members, the masses and propagandists. And in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and enlistment and other central tasks, reorganized the original fifteen propagandists, eliminated five propagandists who did not meet the conditions, and re-elected nine Party members and masses who met the conditions as propagandists. There are now a total of nineteen propagandists in the township (including seven Party members, eight League members, and four non-Party League members). It was clearly stipulated that the Party branch secretary should lead the propaganda network work, and the branch propaganda committee member should assist in management. Propagandists are divided into five小组 [xiǎozǔ - group/team] according to administrative villages (Note: Do not treat the propagandist 小组 [xiǎozǔ - group/team] as a level of organization; in today's decentralized rural environment where the Party's foundation is weak, this can be done for the convenience of leading the propagandists). It is stipulated that小组 [xiǎozǔ - group/team] meetings should be held every ten days, and propagandist conferences should be held once a month, and temporary meetings can be convened in special circumstances.

Each different meeting has different content and methods, achieving different requirements. At the meeting of Party member cadres, the main problem was the disregard for propaganda network work or the idea that it was difficult to combine with the central work. At the meeting, through summarizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and water control work, it was checked whether propaganda work had been done and what the effect was. For example: When mobilizing laborers to control water, some of the masses had run away due to rumors. The township Party member cadre meeting seized on this fact and started a discussion, gradually leading to the importance of the propaganda network; at the same time, according to the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, the bias in the initial development of propagandists was checked. After such in-depth and detailed research, the general Party member cadres had a basic understanding of why the propaganda network work should be established.

At the meeting of propagandists and mass representatives, in addition to summarizing the achievements of the propagandists' work in the initial establishment of the propaganda network, the active propagandist Cheng Anzhen was also praised for her work in water control. At the same time, the Central Committee's decision on establishing propaganda network work was briefly conveyed, and the slogan "It is an honor to be a Party propagandist" was put forward. It was explained that "there are preaching stations in the district, which regularly impart propaganda content, so there is no fear of running out of stock," "Propaganda can be done during production and chatting, without hindering production," "People break through in front of people, knives 'clang' on stones, there is nothing difficult in the world, as long as the heart is focused, if you can't speak, practice and practice." It also explained the reason why some individuals cannot get the support of the masses and cannot be propagandists. The preliminary opinions discussed within the branch on who can be a propagandist and who should be eliminated were brought up at the meeting for discussion. Before the meeting, the branch committee members had talked with the propagandists separately. After the meeting education, the propagandists' main thoughts were resolved. For example, Gu Fenghao reviewed: "I didn't understand the ideology before and refused to be a propagandist. I haven't propagandized to anyone until now. I must learn from Cheng Anzhen in the future and be a model propagandist."

Afterwards, mass meetings were held in each village to further implement the significance and methods of establishing a propaganda network to the masses, introducing who the propagandists are and why some people cannot be propagandists, in order to improve the masses' understanding of the establishment of propaganda network work and establish the prestige of the propagandists, so that they can better carry out their work.

In addition, individual education was also carried out on Gu Chunsheng and the other five former propagandists, and they were transferred to mass propaganda teams (such as participating in club theater groups, etc.).

After the above series of meetings, the various ideological obstacles were basically resolved. However, the next problem was: How can cadres and Party members combine the establishment of propaganda network work with the central work? They also felt it was difficult.

The township was organizing enlistment work when it was reorganizing and developing the propaganda network. At that time, the general cadres and Party members were worried: Should we engage in enlistment first? Or should we establish a propaganda network first? Some advocated that the propaganda committee member should take a few people to establish a propaganda network, and the branch secretary should be responsible for enlistment; others advocated that "the two tasks should be carried out together, preferably: put a few points of strength on enlistment, and divide a few points of strength to establish a propaganda network." In this way, they hastily wanted to separate the establishment of propaganda network work from the central task, not understanding that the establishment of a propaganda network is precisely for the smooth completion of the central task, so there were still individual Party members who regarded the establishment of propaganda network work as an extra burden.

Based on the above situation, the township branch did not first propose the requirement of establishing a propaganda network when deploying enlistment work, but only arranged for each cadre and Party member to do two things: (1) Each Party member, especially Party members who are propagandists, should do a good job of publicizing the significance, policies, and tasks of enlistment, and help and promote other propagandists and mass propaganda organizations (such as theater groups) to carry out propaganda; (2) Everyone should discover and scout for propagandist targets who meet the conditions in the enlistment task, so that they can be nominated and approved at the next branch meeting.

Then, a conference of propagandists was convened to deploy the propaganda work of enlistment. After the task was just issued, the next problem was that the propagandists proposed: "Although our thoughts on being propagandists are clear, we still don't know how to propagandize. We ask someone to show us what to do first, and then we are willing to go out alone." In response to this kind of thinking, the branch continued to educate on the one hand, explaining that a Party propagandist should be bold and not be afraid of being rejected. On the other hand, it also proposed to formulate different propaganda plans for each person based on their different specialties. And mobilized the active propagandist Cheng Anzhen to give a demonstration report using her own example of how to be a propagandist, inspiring everyone how to find propaganda objects? How to start a conversation? Special emphasis was placed on the propaganda methods of "dealing with people and things," "seeing emotions arise," "from chatting to raising questions," and "from family matters to national affairs." In this way, the confidence of each propagandist in daring to carry out propaganda to the people was basically established.

The next problem to be solved was to enable the propagandists to carry out a thorough propaganda of the tasks assigned by the higher authorities to the people step by step. Based on the township's entire deployment for mobilizing enlistment at that time, the branch divided it into three stages: "mobilization and brewing, registration for enlistment, and consolidation of emotions," and explained different propaganda contents for different stages to the propagandists. Each propagandist was enabled to confidently formulate a propaganda plan for the enlistment task, and it was required that the propaganda attitude should not be impatient or randomly label people, and that patient persuasion should be achieved so that the objects of propaganda could truly understand the ideas. In order to solve the problem of each propagandist being able to carry out propaganda to the surrounding people on the principle of not hindering their own production work, the branch proposed: Based on the three standards of familiarity with people, familiarity with places, and familiarity with situations, divide the propaganda objects and scope of each propagandist, and grasp the propaganda tools according to each person's characteristics, and carry out propaganda to the people in four ways: singing, speaking, writing, and reading.

As a result of solving various specific and difficult problems in such a series, the work of all nineteen propagandists in the township became active. The propagandist Xia Baojiang used to dress up as a clown in the theater troupe and could sing more than a dozen fast-talking verses about resisting America and aiding Korea. Wherever he went, he would take a bamboo pole to dance as a clown and speak fast-talking verses. As he sang and talked, he would be surrounded by more than a dozen people. The masses called him "Happy Head" and liked to be close to him. Another example is the female propagandist Cheng Anzhen. When mobilizing Shu Changsheng to enlist, she used the method of "thinking about the past and comparing today" and spent a full three days breaking through the thinking of Shu Changsheng and his parents, making him gloriously sign up to enlist. During the New Year, the masses lined up lists to invite the new soldiers who enlisted to eat. Generally, it was simple, practical, and enthusiastic, making each new soldier who enlisted feel the glory of their enlistment.

The reason why the township's enlistment work was able to exceed the expected plan and improve the masses' awareness was mainly due to the township's propagandists being able to actively carry out propaganda to the people in conjunction with the central work. Later, when the township branch summarized the overall results of the enlistment task, it studied and affirmed the important significance of establishing a propaganda network, and used living facts to educate cadres and Party members, and finally swept away the erroneous understanding that still existed in the minds of some Party members and cadres who believed that "propaganda network work is difficult to combine with the central task."

　　中共苏北台北县七里灶乡支部整理宣传网的经过
        邵普
    中共苏北盐城地委台北县七里灶乡支部建立宣传网的工作，是去年九月间和平签名运动中开始的。当时曾经从党内到党外，从支部到小组进行了反复的思想动员，以后又结合抗美援朝运动及参军等项中心工作进行了整理与发展，现已渐次步入正规。全乡十九个宣传员，都普遍地认为：“当了党的宣传员，是光荣的。”
    该乡在初期建立宣传网时，支部领导思想是不明确的。例如支部书记认为：“建立宣传网，是支部宣传委员的事情。”而支部宣传委员又未认识到宣传网的重要性，只有单纯的任务观点，急性地规定每个村（该乡共有五个行政村）发展三个宣传员；但是共产党员都不愿担任宣传员。选择宣传员又不慎重，把二流子顾春生也发展为宣传员，致引起群众对建立宣传网表现轻视，反映说：“建立宣传网，就是组织二流子。”共产党员干部，有的认为：“有共产党员，有青年团员，不需要宣传员。”也有的认为：“没有宣传员，照样能完成工作任务。”“现在任务一个紧接一个，又要建立宣传网，那有时间？”已经成为宣传员的群众，思想有顾虑，怕耽误生产，怕事事要带头，也有的怕宣传时没材料，因而情绪都不高。
    该乡支部根据以上思想情况，曾先后召开党员干部会议、党员与团员的支部联席会议、宣传员及群众代表会议、五个行政村的村民大会等，结合本地实际情况去学习中央关于建立宣传网工作的决定，运用各种会议与个别漫谈相结合的方法，逐步深入地打通干部与党员、群众与宣传员的思想。并结合抗美援朝运动及参军等中心工作，整理了原有的十五个宣传员，共洗刷了五个不合条件的宣传员，又重新选拔了九个合乎条件的党员与群众为宣传员。现全乡共十九个宣传员（包括党员七人、团员八人、非党员团员四人）。明确规定了党支部书记领导宣传网工作，支部宣传委员协助管理。按行政村把宣传员分别编成五个小组（按：不要把宣传员小组作为一级组织，在今天某些党的基础薄弱的农村分散环境下，为着对宣传员领导的方便，可这样作）。规定每十天开一次小组会议，每一个月开一次宣传员大会，如有特殊情况可召集临时会议。
    各个不同的会议都有不同的内容与方法，达到了不同的要求。在党员干部会议上，主要解决了对宣传网工作不重视，或认为与中心工作难结合的思想。在会上通过总结抗美援朝运动及治水工作，检查是否做了宣传工作，做的效果如何？例如：该乡在动员民工治水时，曾有部分群众因受谣言的影响，曾发生逃跑的现象。该乡党员干部会议遂抓住这个事实展开讨论，逐步引导到宣传网的重要性上来；同时，又根据中央建立宣传网的决定，检查了初期发展宣传员的偏向，经过这样深入细致的研究，一般党员干部对为什么要建立宣传网工作有了基本的认识。
    在宣传员及群众代表会议上，除一面总结初期建立宣传网时宣传员工作的成绩，又表扬了在治水工作中积极的宣传员成安珍，同时扼要地传达了中央关于建立宣传网工作的决定，以及提出“做党的宣传员是光荣的”的口号。说明：“区内有传授站，经常传授宣传内容，不怕没货”，“生产时，拉呱时，都可以宣传，不妨碍生产”，“人在人前闯，刀在石上‘铛’，天下无难事，只要心一专，不会讲话，锻炼锻炼就行了。”又说明了个别人得不到群众的拥护，不能为宣传员的道理。把支部内讨论的谁可为宣传员，及谁该洗刷的初步意见，提到会上来讨论。会前，曾由支部委员分别地与宣传员谈过话，经过会议教育，宣传员的主要思想解决了。如顾凤高检讨说：“我以前思想不通，不肯做宣传员，到现在就没有向人宣传过，今后一定要向成安珍学习，做一个模范宣传员。”
    以后又分村召开了群众大会，把建立宣传网的意义、方法，进一步贯彻到群众中去，介绍了那些人是宣传员，有的人为什么不能当宣传员，以提高群众对建立宣传网工作的认识，树立宣传员的威信，使其能更好地进行工作。
    此外，对顾春生等五个以前的宣传员亦曾进行个别教育，并分别地将他们转入群众性的宣传队伍（如参加俱乐部剧团等）。
    经过了以上一系列的会议以后，各种思想障碍算是基本上解决了。但是接着来的问题是：干部党员对建立宣传网工作如何与中心工作结合的问题，又感到困难。
    该乡在整理与发展宣传网时正值搞参军工作。当时一般干部党员都在忧虑着：先搞参军呢？抑或是先建立宣传网呢？有的主张，宣传委员带几个人去建立宣传网，支部书记负责搞参军；也有人主张“两项工作一起搞，最好是：放几分力量在参军上，分几分力量去建立宣传网”。这样急性地想把建立宣传网工作与中心任务割裂开来，不懂得建立宣传网正是为了顺利完成中心任务，因此亦仍有个别党员把建立宣传网工作看成是额外负担。
    该乡支部根据以上情况，在布置参军工作同时，就没有首先提出建立宣传网的要求，只布置每个干部党员做好两件事：（一）每个党员特别是做宣传员的党员，要很好地宣传参军的意义政策与任务，帮助与推动其他宣传员及群众性的宣传组织（如剧团）进行宣传；（二）要大家在参军任务中，发现与物色够条件的宣传员对象，以便在下一次支部会上提名通过。
    接着又召开了宣传员大会布置参军的宣传工作，在任务刚下达以后，接着又来的问题是宣传员提出：“我们做宣传员的思想虽通了，但仍不会宣传，要求有人先做个样子看看，然后才愿意单独出马。”支部针对这样思想又一方面继续教育说明：做一个党的宣传员，应当要胆大，不怕碰钉子，一方面又提出根据各人不同的特长，订出各人不同的宣传计划。并发动积极宣传员成安珍，以她自己怎样做一个宣传员的实例，作示范报告，启发大家如何找宣传对象？怎样引头子（开头讲话）？特别提出“就人就事”、“见眼生情”、“以拉呱到出题”、“从家常到国事”的宣传方法。这样，才基本上确立了各个宣传员敢于向人民群众进行宣传的信心。
    接着需要解决的问题，是使宣传员把上级布置的任务有步骤地向人民群众进行透彻的宣传。支部根据当时该乡发动参军的整个部署，分成“动员酝酿、报名参军、巩固情绪”三个阶段，按阶段向宣传员交代不同阶段的不同的宣传内容。使各个宣传员都有信心地订出了参军任务中的宣传计划，并要求宣传态度不急躁，不乱加人“帽子”，做到耐心说服，使被宣传的对象，真正把思想弄通。为着解决各个宣传员能在不妨碍自己的生产工作的原则下，去向周围人民群众进行宣传，支部提出：根据人熟、地熟、情况熟的三个标准，划分每个宣传员的宣传的对象与范围，并根据各人的特点，分别掌握宣传工具，分唱、讲、写、读四种方式，向人民群众进行宣传。
    由于这样一连串地解决了各种具体困难问题，全乡十九个宣传员工作都积极起来了。宣传员夏保江原在剧团内装小丑，会唱十几个抗美援朝的快板，他走到那里，就拿根竹竿子跳小丑、说快板，唱唱说说，一围就是十几个人，群众都喊他，叫做“快活头子”，喜欢接近他。又如女宣传员成安珍，动员束长盛参军，她用“想过去、比今天”的方法，化了整整三天的时间，打通了束长盛及其父母的思想，使他光荣报名参军。新年时群众排着名单子请参军的新战士们吃饭，一般是简单、实惠、而热情，使每个参军的新战士都感到自己参军的光荣。
    该乡参军工作所以能超过预期的计划，并且提高了群众的觉悟，主要是由于该乡宣传员能够结合中心工作积极地向人民群众进行宣传的结果。后该乡支部在总结参军任务的总成绩时，研究与肯定了建立宣传网的重要意义，并以活的事实，教育了干部、党员，最后地扫除了部分党员干部思想上仍存在的认为“宣传网工作，难以与中心任务结合”的错误认识。
