　　Privately Held Guns Should Be Turned Over to the Government
　　To the Editor:
    I am a businessman in Beijing. When the People's Liberation Army surrounded Beijing, through a friend's introduction, I allowed a Kuomintang reactionary soldier to store a gun and more than ninety bullets in my home. At the time, he said he would come to get it in two or three days; but he still hasn't come to take it. Although the People's Government has repeatedly called on those hiding guns to turn them over; I am timid and afraid that turning in the gun would arouse the government's suspicion, so I have not turned it in. But the gun is always in the house, and it is always a weight on my mind. I thought about throwing the gun away, but I felt that it was not good; because this would not only cause a loss to state property, but it could also be taken by counter-revolutionaries as a tool to harm the people.
    I am struggling fiercely in my mind, not knowing what to do, please give me an idea, Mr. Editor.
        A Citizen of Beijing
            Dear Citizen:
    The People's Government trusts and loves the people. Every citizen should also abide by the policies and decrees of the People's Government. Hiding guns and bullets is illegal; it is inevitable that this matter is a "weight on your mind". As long as you voluntarily turn over the hidden guns and bullets to the government, not only can you get rid of your worries, but you will also be encouraged and welcomed by the government, and you will never be suspected or punished by the government.

### 私藏枪支应向政府缴出

　　私藏枪支应向政府缴出编辑先生：
    我是北京市的一个商人。在人民解放军包围北京时，我经朋友介绍，让一个国民党反动派的军人把一支枪和九十多粒子弹存在我家。当时他说两三天后就来拿；可是至今还没有来取。人民政府虽然曾经再三号召藏匿枪支者把枪交出来；可是我胆小，怕交了枪反引起政府怀疑，因此一直没有交。但是枪老存在家里，总是心上一块病。我想把枪扔掉，但又感到不好；因为这不但使国家财产受到损失，还可能被反革命分子拿去作残害人民的工具。
    我思想斗争得很厉害，不知怎样才好，请编辑先生代我出个主意。
        北京市一市民
            一市民：
    人民政府对人民是相信和爱护的。每个人民也应该遵守人民政府的政策和法令。藏匿枪支、子弹是违法的；此事形成你“心里一块病”也是必然的。只要你自动向政府交出了藏匿的枪支、子弹，不仅可以去掉心病，而且还会受到政府的鼓励和欢迎，绝不会受政府的怀疑和处罚。
