Dear mothers and sisters of the nation!

I implore you, for the sake of my daughter Liu Hulan, and for the sake of the millions of women and children murdered by the Japanese devils, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Yan Xishan bandit gang, to support the Declaration for the Conclusion of a Peace Pact, oppose the rearmament of Japan, and resolutely sign and vote!

Sisters! When I hear that American imperialism is invading Korea and rearming Japan, and wants to invade our China again, I think of the painful situation under the rule of the Japanese devils, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan in the past, and I remember the situation of my daughter Hulan being murdered.

I will never forget January 12, 1947. On that day, I watched helplessly as my daughter and six farmers were hacked to death with铡 knives by Yan's bandit army. Whenever I think of this, my heart feels like it's being cut by a knife.

Sisters! I have suffered such pain, and I think some of you have also suffered such pain. Think about it, how painful would your heart be if your children, whom you raised yourself, were killed by the enemy for no reason!

Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we have shed a lot of blood and gained liberation. But American imperialism wants to invade us and kill us again. I say in my heart: Are we mothers raising children just to be killed by imperialists and traitors? No, we must never let our children be killed again. We must fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and resolutely eliminate those evil American bandits.

Thinking of my daughter, I feel that she is immensely glorious. She was only fifteen years old at that time and was a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party. I didn't expect that at such a young age, she would have such great ambition. In front of the enemy, she was truly strong and resolute, truly a tough bone of the Communist Party, a tough bone of Chinese women. Yan Xishan's bandit army arrested her but could not force a single confession out of her. Yan Xishan's bandit army first铡 killed six farmers, and each time they killed one, they asked her: "Are you afraid? Will you surrender?" She resolutely said: "What am I afraid of? I would rather die than submit, I will never surrender!" She lay on the铡 knife without changing her expression and was killed by Yan's bandit army.

My daughter is dead, but her spirit still exists, living in everyone's heart. Our leader Chairman Mao wrote eight big characters for her, saying that she "lived greatly and died gloriously." The Jinzhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a memorial meeting for her. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army also held a public memorial ceremony at her tomb. The People's Government of our county comes to worship her every year during the Qingming Festival. Her heroic deeds have been published in newspapers, adapted into plays, and filmed into movies, telling the people of the whole country and the people of the world. People take her as an example and learn from her.

Liu Hulan's spirit inspires every Chinese to wage a heroic struggle against imperialism and counter-revolution. For the sake of my daughter, I joined the village's Democratic Women's Federation and was elected chairman. During the land reform, I gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. I have also received many letters from all over the country, from soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, staff members, and also students and workers. They all said that they would learn from Liu Hulan's spirit, avenge Liu Hulan, and avenge the millions of compatriots killed by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Dear sisters! Please clearly remember the blood debts owed to us by imperialism, Chiang, and Yan's bandit gang! For the sake of our murdered children, and so that our children will no longer be harmed, please enthusiastically sign and vote, and actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement!

　　请你们踊跃地签名投票吧！
    刘胡兰的母亲给全国母亲们的一封信亲爱的全国母亲们、姊妹们！
    我请求你们，为了我的女儿刘胡兰，为了千万个被日本鬼子、蒋介石、阎锡山匪帮杀害的妇女和儿童，拥护缔结和平公约宣言，反对重新武装日本，坚决地签名和投票吧！
    姊妹们！当我听到美帝国主义正在侵略朝鲜，还重新武装日本，又想再来侵略咱中国，我就想到过去日本鬼子、蒋介石、阎锡山统治下的痛苦情形，想起我的女儿胡兰被残害的情形。
    我一辈子也忘不了一九四七年一月十二日。那天，我眼巴巴地看见我的女儿和六个农民，被阎匪军活活用铡刀铡死。我一想起这事就不由得心上如同刀割一般。
    姊妹们！我受到这样的痛苦，我想你们也有受到这样痛苦的人。想想看，你亲自抚养长大的子女，无缘无故地被敌人杀死，你的心会多难受呀！
    现在，我们在毛主席、共产党领导下，流了多少鲜血，得到了解放。可是美帝国主义又想侵略咱们，杀害咱们。我心里说：难道我们母亲们抚养子女，就是为了供帝国主义、卖国贼杀害吗？不能的，我们绝对不能让自己的子女再被人杀害。我们要全力支援我国人民志愿军，坚决消灭那些万恶的美国强盗。
    想起我的女儿，我觉得她无尚的光荣。她那时才十五周岁，是中国共产党的候补党员。我想不到她，那样小的年纪，竟有那样大的志气。她在敌人面前，真是刚强、坚决，真是共产党的硬骨头，中国妇女的硬骨头。阎锡山匪军捉住她，没有逼出一点口供。阎锡山匪军先铡死了六个农民，每铡死一个就问她：“你怕不怕？投降不投降？”她都坚决地说：“我怕什么？我死也不屈服，决不投降！”她面不改色地躺到铡刀上，被阎匪军杀死。
    我的女儿死了，她的精神还存在着，活在人人的心里。我们的领袖毛主席，给她写过八个大字，说她“生的伟大死的光荣”。中国共产党晋中区地方委员会，开过追悼她的大会。人民解放军某部的指战员还到她的墓前举行公祭。我们县里的人民政府，每年清明节，都来祭奠她。她的英勇事迹被登在报上、排成戏、拍成电影，告诉给全国人民、全世界人民。人们都把她当成榜样，向她学习。
    刘胡兰的精神，鼓舞着我们每个中国人，向帝国主义、向反革命去进行英勇的斗争。为了我的女儿，我参加了本村民主妇女联合会，还被选为主席。土地改革的时候，我又光荣地加入了中国共产党。我还收到过很多的信，从全国各个地方寄来，有解放军战士的，有工作人员的，也有学生和工人的。他们都说要学习刘胡兰的精神，为刘胡兰报仇，为被帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮杀害的千万同胞报仇。
    亲爱的姊妹们！请你们清楚地记下帝国主义、蒋、阎匪帮欠下我们的血债吧！为了我们被杀害的子女，为了我们的子女不再受到残害，请你们踊跃地签名和投票，积极地参加抗美援朝运动吧！
          刘胡兰的母亲胡文秀
