　　The "Stubborn" in the Compound Changes
    ——A Record of the Education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea Received by a Beijing Compound
      Dong Qian
    The compound at 16 Houtiejiangying in the Fourth District is an epitome of the many compounds in Beijing. This compound houses twelve families, a total of forty-four people, including thirty able-bodied adults and elderly, and fourteen children. There are carpenters, merchants, peddlers, rickshaw pullers, sweet potato sellers, and land surveyors. It wasn't until January of this year, when the Yiguandao cult leader Han Dazhi (puppet Baojia chief, landlord) was arrested, that the thinking of the people in this compound began to change; especially after the propaganda about Resisting America and Aiding Korea in April, and the women's radio denunciation meeting, "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" truly entered this compound.
    Before the banning of Yiguandao, three families, five people, in this compound were Yiguandao members, two of whom were major and minor cult leaders. In such a complex political situation, "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" had been kept outside the compound gate. What was often heard inside the compound was the landlord scolding the tenants, and the rumors of "three periods of demonic tribulation" and "great disaster." Especially since the outbreak of the American war of aggression against Korea last year, the landlord's arrogance has been even greater, refusing to repair leaky houses or broken electrical wires, and demanding payment of rent at retail prices. After the liberation of Seoul last winter, staff members came to this compound to conduct propaganda and solicit donations. The landlord refused to lend the place for meetings, and only two families vaguely donated one thousand yuan and two towels. Hu Ruifu, the daughter of Zhang Wanqing, the Yiguandao cult leader in the west room, wanted to apply to a military cadre school at Xinsheng Middle School last winter, but was blocked by her. She said, "Resist what America, aid what Korea, now it's the 'three periods of demonic tribulation,' 'great disaster,' better stay at home!" Under the cover of these evil influences, none of the thirty able-bodied adults and elderly men and women living in this compound, except for workers, students, and street representatives, had participated in a single mass meeting in the past two years; even the already sensational parades and demonstrations celebrating National Day, the liberation of Seoul, and the "March 8th" Women's Day, did not disturb this remote compound.
    In January, the government banned Yiguandao. Puppet Baojia chief Han Dazhi was detained, and Zhang Wanqing was fined seventy bags of flour; the other residents applauded with delight. Patriotic ideas of Resisting America and Aiding Korea slowly spread to the compound.
    In March, street representative Chen Yunxin returned from a meeting at the police station and established a women's literacy group at home, with four women from the compound participating. In addition, he mobilized merchant Bai Hengbin to subscribe to the People's Daily, reading it to everyone every day. Activists concerned about current affairs began to emerge. However, most people still did not know what Resisting America and Aiding Korea was all about, especially the puppet Baojia chief's wife and Zhang Wanqing, who simply did not want to hear the four words "Resisting America and Aiding Korea." When their daughters talked about Resisting America and Aiding Korea or sang songs about it, they felt annoyed and scolded, "America is fighting Korea, not China, why should China resist America and aid Korea!" Their daughters knew they couldn't get through to them, so they scolded them as "stubborn!" "Old feudalists!" Ideological struggle unfolded from within the family. Zhang Wanqing thought: if Yiguandao is good, why did it lead to bankruptcy, if the People's Government is bad, why were they lenient with me. She said to everyone, "I believed in Yiguandao for ten years, my sins are truly too great!" But she still did not understand why it was necessary to resist America and aid Korea. In early April, her daughter took her to see a film about the Korean War. When she saw the atrocities of the American troops and the miserable state of motherless children, she was moved to tears for the first time, arousing hatred for American imperialism. Around the 20th, after the students of the Women's Cadre School came to this compound to promote the cause, she learned about the atrocities of the Japanese devils; especially during the women's radio denunciation on the 24th, the bestialities of those Japanese devils who raped women everywhere and ripped open their stomachs greatly aroused her national hatred. She cried and cursed, "So hateful, worse than wolves and leopards, are they even human!" That same evening, she voluntarily proposed to the street representative that she would respond to the call of Cai Chang, chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, and establish a family patriotic pact. In addition to immediately donating eight pairs of socks, she decided to donate three thousand yuan every month from now on. She said, "I will take the money I used to burn incense on the first and fifteenth of every month and donate it to the People's Volunteer Army." She will continue to donate until the American devils are driven away. She not only realized the truth that "if the American devils come, even if the family has ten thousand guan of property, it will be difficult to protect!" but also took pride in her daughter's participation in the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. Recently, in order to participate in the "May 1st" grand demonstration, she still asks her daughter to teach her songs before going to bed. Her sixteen-year-old daughter also dares to sing and dance in front of her now. She said, "Now my 'stubbornness' has become active, and the family is no longer me opposing you, you opposing me, it has truly become a family!"
    After the women's radio denunciation meeting, now all thirty able-bodied adults and elderly people in the compound, except for two, have all been involved in this movement. Seventeen of them have automatically requested to participate in the "May 1st" grand demonstration. Mrs. Qi, who is seven months pregnant, was persuaded several times by her neighbors not to go, but she insisted on going. Those who remained were not unwilling to go, but were either held back by breastfeeding children or stayed behind to watch the house. Old Mrs. Qi, who is already sixty-two years old, also volunteered to stay at home to look after four children.
    Nine families have donated to the Volunteer Army and signed patriotic pacts, accounting for three-quarters of the total households in the compound. Rickshaw puller Zhou Youren also proposed to donate all the income from May 3rd. Wang Cuiqin's eleven-year-old child also wants to save four hundred yuan of snack money every day to donate to the People's Volunteer Army.
    The compound at 16 Houtiejiangying has not only basically achieved the requirement that "every place and every person receive education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea," but also has undergone tremendous changes in family and social relations. Puppet Baojia chief's wife's niece Wang Cuiqin and niece-in-law Mrs. Qi have "disowned" her as a relative.

　　大杂院的“死脑筋”改变了
    ——记北京一个大杂院所受的抗美援朝教育
      董谦
    第四区后铁匠营十六号里的大杂院，就是北京许多大杂院的缩影。这个大杂院住有十二家人。共四十四口人，其中青壮老年三十人，少年儿童十四人。有木匠工人、行商、小贩、蹬三轮的，卖白薯的和丈地的。直到今年一月把一贯道坛主韩大志（伪保甲长，房东）捉起来后，这个大杂院人的思想才开始发生变化；特别是经过四月间抗美援朝的宣传，和妇女广播控诉大会以后，“抗美援朝”才真正进到这个大杂院。
    取缔一贯道以前，住在这个大杂院的十二家人，就有三家、五口人是一贯道，其中有两人则是大小坛主。在这样复杂的政治情况下，“抗美援朝”一直是被隔在院门外的。而在院内经常听见的则是房东辱骂房客的声音，和“三期魔劫”“灾难大”的流言。特别从去年美国侵朝战争爆发以来，房东的气焰更盛，房子漏了不给修，电线坏了也不给修，收房钱的时候还要按零售价折实。去冬解放汉城后，曾有工作人员来到这大杂院进行宣传劝募。房东不借给地方开会，只有两家糊里糊涂地捐了一千元和两条手巾。西屋一贯道坛主张万青的女儿胡瑞孚，去年冬天在新生中学要求报名参加军事干部学校，也被她阻挡住了。她说：“抗什么美，援什么朝，现在是‘三期魔劫’、‘灾难大’，还是待在家里吧！”在这些邪气笼罩下，住在这个大杂院的三十个青壮老年男女，除工人、学生、街代表外，二年来没有一个人参加过一次群众性的会；就是那些已轰动全市的庆祝国庆节、庆祝汉城解放、庆祝“三八”节的游行示威，也没有惊动了这个偏僻的大杂院。
    一月份政府取缔一贯道。伪保甲长韩大志被扣起来，张万青被罚了七十袋面；其他的居民鼓掌称快。抗美援朝爱国思想才慢慢传播到大杂院。
    三月间，街代表陈运新从派出所开会回来，就在家里建立起妇女识字小组，本院参加的妇女有四个人。另外，还动员行商白恒斌订了一份人民日报，天天向大家读报。关心时事的积极分子已开始出现。但是还有大部分人不知道抗美援朝是怎么回事，特别是像伪保甲长老婆，和张万青这两个人，对“抗美援朝”四个字简直听都不愿听。当她们的女儿谈起抗美援朝或唱起抗美援朝的歌子时，她们便感到烦恼地骂着：“美国打朝鲜，又不是打中国，中国为什么要去抗美援朝！”她们的女儿知道打不通她们的思想，就骂她们是“死脑筋！”“老封建！”思想斗争从家庭内部展开了。张万青心想：说一贯道好吧，反弄得倾家破产，说人民政府不好吧，把自己也宽大了。她逢人便说：“我信了十年一贯道，真是罪恶太大了！”可是对于为什么要抗美援朝还是不了然。四月初，她的女儿带她看了一次关于朝鲜战争的影片。当她看到美军的暴行、没娘孩子的惨状时，她第一次感动得流出同情的眼泪，引起对美帝国主义的仇恨心。二十号左右，妇女干部学校的学员到这大杂院宣传后，她又知道了日本鬼子的暴行；特别是在二十四日妇女的广播控诉中，那些日本鬼子到处轮奸妇女、豁开肠肚的兽行，更大大地激发了她的民族仇恨。她边哭边骂着：“真可恶，比狼虎豹还厉害，这还是人呀！”当天晚上，她就自动向街代表提出，要响应全国妇联主席蔡大姐的号召，订立家庭的爱国公约。她除立即捐出八双袜子外，决定以后每月还要捐出三千元。她说：“我要把过去每月初一、十五烧香的钱拿出来，捐给人民志愿军。”她一直要捐到把美国鬼子赶走为止。她不仅认识了“要是美国鬼子来了，家虽有财产万贯也难保！”的道理，而且，以她的女儿参加抗美援朝工作为光荣。她最近为了要参加“五一”大示威，睡下觉还让她女儿教歌子。她的十六岁的女儿，也敢于在她跟前又唱又跳了。她说：“现在我的‘死脑筋’变活了，家里也不再是你反对我，我反对你了，已真正变成一家人！”
    经过妇女广播控诉大会以后，现在全院青壮老年三十人，除两人外，全部都卷进了这一运动。他（她）们自动要求参加“五一”大示威的已达十七人。祁太太怀着七个月的孕，经街坊几次劝说不要去，她还是非要去不行。留下的人也不是不愿意去，却都是被吃奶的孩子拖累住或是留下看门。祁家老太太已经六十二岁的人了，也自报要留在家里看四个小孩。
    给志愿军捐献和订爱国公约的各有九家，占全院户数的四分之三。三轮车夫周友仁并提出要把五月三日一天的所得都捐献出来。王翠琴的十一岁的孩子，也要每天节省出四百元的点心费捐给人民志愿军。
    后铁匠营十六号大杂院，不仅已在基本上达到“每一处每一人都受到抗美援朝教育”的要求，而且在家庭社会关系上也起了巨大的变化。伪保长老婆的亲侄女王翠琴、外甥女祁太太已“不认”她是亲戚了。
