Strive to be a Well-Rounded Young Cadre
    Dong Xinbao, Department of Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Mining

　　Before the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began last year, I was a young man who didn't care about politics or current affairs. At that time, I thought that what the country needed most urgently was construction—especially in the industrial field. I should try my best to do well in my studies and master science and technology so that I could serve the new democratic construction in the future. As for political activities and knowledge of current affairs, I thought they had nothing to do with science and technology, so I didn't need to bother with them, or at least I could spend less effort on them. When the department held a mobilization meeting, I made excuses to avoid it. Because at that time, I mistakenly thought that the mobilization meeting was just about shouting a few slogans and finding a few people to say a few words: could it mobilize me! And I didn't agree with suspending classes, feeling that propaganda work would delay my studies. If I were to put a label on this kind of thinking at that time, it should be pure technical viewpoint and one-sided expert thought. The formation of this kind of thinking was mainly due to the influence of the old society during the Kuomintang rule, which made me lack a sufficient understanding of the greatness of the motherland. I only knew that the new society and the new government were good, but I couldn't say exactly where or to what extent they were good. Therefore, my love for the motherland was not expressed enough. Later, in this great movement, the workers and peasants educated me, and many moving examples educated me, making me gradually realize that my past ideas were completely wrong, and making me realize the invincible power of the Chinese people and the greatness and loveliness of the motherland.

　　In the past, my attitude towards learning was also very incorrect. This was caused by my lack of a clear understanding of the purpose of learning in my mind. At that time, I was very envious of those classmates who buried themselves in books all day long. On Sundays, when I should have had a good rest, I sat in the library for twelve hours; when there were no classes in the afternoon, I went to the library and sat from 12:30 to 6:30. I didn't care about work or do any sports activities, which made me feel dizzy. I thought that this way I could be worthy of myself and the people, regarding learning as an isolated thing.

　　During the spring vacation in the countryside, the village cadres I saw generally had a low level of education, and some were even illiterate, but they had political awareness, firm stance, and strong organizational skills. This made me feel that young people can truly serve the people only when they have progressive ideas.

　　Comrade Feng Wenbin repeatedly explained to us that the health of young people has a great direct impact on the construction of the motherland, and he put forward many specific methods for us, asking us to strengthen cultural and sports activities. In order to reduce our burden, he was determined to thoroughly do a good job in curriculum reform, requiring teachers to improve teaching content and methods. Because if a young person does not have a healthy body, how can he serve the people? For example, a good machine must not only be exquisitely constructed, but also be strong and durable. If it looks exquisite on the outside but is of poor quality, when you use it, its shaft may bend suddenly, or its flywheel may really fly away from the machine. What is the difference between this kind of machine and scrap iron, and what good is it to our motherland?

　　I didn't pay much attention to health before, so my body was very bad. Before I even got to the city gate to do propaganda, I was already out of breath. Some students went to the factory and felt dizzy and overwhelmed after standing next to the stove for less than five minutes. Many practical tests and the experiences of classmates have made me feel that I must have a healthy body if I want to serve the people well. The future of the motherland—that is, the future of our young students—is infinitely bright and splendid. The motherland has arranged many glorious tasks and jobs for us. Let us strive to be well-rounded cadres for the construction of a new China under the banner of the great "May Fourth" Movement!

　　争取做一个全面发展的青年干部
    北京大学沙工电机系  董新保
    在去年抗美援朝运动开始以前，我是一个不关心政治也不关心时事的青年。那时，我认为国家目前最迫切需要的就是建设—尤其是工业方面的，我应该尽量搞好业务学习，掌握科学技术，以便在将来为新民主主义建设服务；至于政治活动、时事知识，我以为是和科学技术没有关系的，可以不必费心，至少可以少费些心。系里开动员大会时，我借故逃避了。因为当时我错误地认为动员大会不过是喊几句口号，找几个人说几句话而已：能动员得了我吗！并且我不赞成停课，觉得宣传工作会耽误学习。当时的这种思想，假如要给我带一顶帽子的话，那么就应该是单纯技术观点，片面专家思想。这种思想的形成，主要是由于国民党统治时期旧社会的影响，使我对于祖国的伟大认识不够。我只知道新社会新政府好，到底好在那里好到什么程度却说不出来。因此，我对于祖国的爱也就表现得很不够。后来，在这个伟大的运动中，工农群众教育了我，很多动人的事例教育了我；使我渐渐地认识到过去的想法是完全错误的，使我认识到中国人民不可战胜的力量，认识到祖国的伟大可爱。
    过去，我的学习态度也很不正确。这是由于我对学习的目的在思想上缺乏明确认识所造成的。那时候我非常羡慕那些整天埋头于书本里的同学。礼拜天的时候，本来应该好好休息一下，我却到图书馆里坐了十二个钟头；下午没有课，我也到图书馆从十二点半一直坐到六点半。既不管工作，也不去做体育活动，结果弄得我昏头昏脑。我自以为这样可对得起自己对得起人民了，把学习看成是孤立的东西。
    春假下乡时，我所见到的村干部，文化程度一般是很低的，有些还不识字，可是他们有政治认识，立场坚定，组织能力强。这使我感到，青年有了进步思想才能真正为人民服务。
    冯文彬同志曾一再向我们说明，青年的健康对于祖国的建设事业有着很大的直接的影响，并且他为我们提出很多具体办法，要我们加强文娱体育活动。为了减轻我们的负担，决心要彻底做好课程改革工作，要求教师们改善教学内容和方法。因为一个青年要是没有健康的身体，怎能为人民服务呢？譬如一架好的机器，不但要构造精巧，而且要结实耐用，假如它外表上很精巧，质量很差，当你使用的时候，说不定它的轴一下就扭弯了，也许它的飞轮就会真的离开机器飞走了。这种机器和废铁有什么区别，它对于我们祖国有什么好处呢？
    我以前对于健康是不太重视的，因此，我的身体很不好，出去宣传还没走到城门口，我就已累得喘不过气来了。有些同学到工厂里去，在火炉旁站了还不到五分钟，就觉得头昏眼花吃不消了。很多的实际考验和同学的经验，都使我感到要想很好地为人民服务必须要有一个健康的身体。祖国的前途—也就是我们青年学生的前途是无限光辉灿烂的。祖国已经为我们安排好了许多光荣的任务和工作，让我们在伟大的“五四”运动的旗帜下为争取做一个全面发展的新中国建设干部而努力吧！
