Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 3rd: The core of the new Japanese army, the so-called "Police Reserve Force," established by order of the American occupation authorities, has openly discarded its disguise and adopted a military organization. On April 26th, Masuhara Keikichi, commander of the "Police Reserve Force," announced that the force had been organized into four divisions, each division with four regiments (one of which is a "technical regiment"), each regiment with three battalions, and each battalion with three companies (including a "heavy weapons company"). The so-called "technical regiment" includes three artillery battalions, one engineer battalion, and one medical battalion. According to reports from the Kuomintang bandit Central News Agency, since August of last year, personnel of the "Police Reserve Force" have been trained under American guidance, using various weapons. It is "evident" from the training that "the reborn Japanese army is imitating the American army."

At the same time, the American occupation authorities, in order to reinstate Japanese militarists, are planning to completely lift the sanctions against militarists. Following MacArthur's lifting of sanctions against more than 13,000 Japanese militarists in the second half of last year, Ridgway even arbitrarily approved the Yoshida government's "re-examination" of Japanese militarists who were placed on the sanctions list for engaging in aggressive activities during the war, in order to "revise" the list. According to Kyodo News, according to this measure, the work of lifting sanctions will "further develop," and "the lifting of sanctions against all sanctioned personnel will be implemented before the conclusion of a (separate) peace treaty." It is said that among the total of 190,000 sanctioned individuals, 100,000 will be restored to public office first.

　　日本“警察后备队”公开实行军队编制
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：由美国占领当局命令建立的日本新陆军的核心——所谓“警察后备队”，已公然抛去伪装面目，改为军队编制。四月二十六日，“警察后备队”长官增原惠吉宣布，该队已被编为四个师，每师四团（其中一个团为“技术团”），每团三营、每营三连（包括一个“重武器连”）。所谓“技术团”，包括三个炮兵营、一个工兵营和一个医护营。据国民党匪帮中央社透露，自从去年八月以来，所谓“警察后备队”人员即在美国的指导下受训，使用各种武器。从训练中可以“明显地”看出，“再生的日本陆军是模仿美国陆军的”。
    与此同时，美国占领当局为了起用日本军国主义分子，正谋全部解除军国主义分子的整肃处分。继麦克阿瑟于去年下半年对一万三千多名日本军国主义分子解除整肃后，李奇微竟于五月一日擅自批准吉田政府“重新审查”因战时从事侵略活动而被列入整肃名单的日本军国主义分子，以便将名单“修改”。据共同社透露，根据这一措施，解除整肃的工作将“进一步向前发展”，“全部整肃人员之解除，将在（单独）和约缔结前实行”。据称，在全体十九万名被整肃者中，将首先有十万人被恢复公权。
