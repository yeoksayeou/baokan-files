Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Guangzhou, May 5th—Guangzhou City held a rally on April 25th to denounce the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements. Participating in the rally were over 30,000 people's representatives from all walks of life in the city and a denunciation delegation organized by the people of Sihui County, hundreds of miles away. Simultaneously, 700,000 citizens and people from various parts of Guangdong Province listened to the live broadcast of the meeting.

　　At the meeting, Mayor Ye Jianying delivered a report on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. After Tan Zhengwen, the representative of the state prosecutor, filed a public prosecution against the counter-revolutionary criminals, fifteen bandits with heinous crimes, including Yao Baoyou, Zhou Dong, Yu Zhide, Chen Jiaqing, and Yang Jujun, were escorted to the scene. Amidst the shouts of "Shoot the counter-revolutionary bandits" from the entire audience, the people who had suffered at the hands of these special agent bandits began their tearful denunciations.

　　The family members of the citizens who were killed by US-Chiang Kai-shek aircraft denounced the crimes of the special agent Yu Zhide. In March of last year, when US-Chiang Kai-shek aircraft bombed Guangzhou, Yu used red cloth as a marker to indicate bombing targets for the bandit aircraft. As a result, hundreds of citizens were killed or injured, 564 houses were destroyed, over 100 boats were sunk, and thousands of people were left homeless. Widow He Mei could not stop crying when she took the stage to denounce him. Her 20-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son were both killed, and her foot was crippled. She said, "The special agent Yu Zhide has caused me so much suffering. The People's Government must shoot him!" Zou Chengxin, whose family lost seven members in the bombing, said with hatred during his denunciation, "My mother, on her sickbed, instructed me: 'We must take revenge!' Today, Yu Zhide, who caused my family's ruin, has been caught. The People's Government must avenge us." The crowd immediately shouted, "Exterminate the damned special agents and avenge the dead compatriots!"

　　Democratic figures Qin Yuanbang and Liang Ruochen, former persecuted Sun Yat-sen University students Hong Siyi and Feng Xunyu, and Chen Mei, the parent of a deceased student, denounced to the assembly the crimes of Yao Baoyou, one of the three major Kuomintang secret service heads in Guangdong who manufactured the Guangzhou "May 31st" bloody massacre, with his hands stained with the blood of young students. Yao was the Kuomintang "Central Statistics Bureau" special agent team leader and the bandit "Guangdong Provincial Director of Education." As early as 1927, he served as a member of the bandit "Chaozhou-Meixian Area Party Purge Committee" and murdered progressive youth Li Chuntao, Wu Bingxi, and others. On May 4, 1946, while arranging the "Anti-Soviet and Anti-Communist Grand Parade," Yao personally directed special agents to destroy the Guangzhou branch of the Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao, the Xiongdi Book Company, and the Guangzhou business office of the Ta Kung Pao. On May 31, 1947, Guangzhou students held a large parade across the city against "civil war, hunger, and persecution." Yao instigated special agents and hooligans to beat the parading students with clubs and iron hooks, creating the "May 31st" bloody massacre that the people of the whole country cannot forget. At the same time, Yao instructed special agents to close the Guangzhou progressive newspaper *Daily Tribune*, arresting the newspaper's director, Zhang Dao, and over 40 employees. On July 23, 1949, Yao masterminded the arrest of 168 students and faculty members of Sun Yat-sen University and secretly executed many students. Chen Mei, the family member of a murdered student, cried uncontrollably at the meeting, "I want to ask Yao, where is the body of my son, Haoming? I want to peel your skin and tear your bones to eliminate the hatred in my heart!" Immediately, calls to "Shoot Yao Baoyou" rose one after another in the venue.

　　The denunciation delegation from Sihui County denounced the heinous crimes of Zhou Dong, the bandit "Director of the Committee for Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation." As early as 1927, Zhou led reactionary armed forces in Guangdong to cooperate with the bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek in betraying the revolution, massacring over 40 Communist Party members, including Xiao Chunu. In the winter of that year, the Kuomintang reactionaries massacred as many as 7,000 to 8,000 revolutionary workers and masses in Guangzhou, and Zhou was one of the blood-soaked executioners. For over 20 years, Zhou resolutely opposed the revolution, massacred the people, and until the eve of liberation, still attempted to stubbornly resist in the Sihui County area of Guangdong, engaging in looting, rape, arson, and murder. Lu Ruiai, a peasant woman from Sihui County, denounced, "Zhou Dong commanded bandits to loot Gangsha Township in Sihui. The entire village was robbed, women were raped, and even my one-year-old niece was stabbed to death with a bayonet. The Kuomintang reactionary bandits have no humanity at all." Old farmer Feng Kai demanded that Zhou be shot immediately to avenge the death of his younger brother.

　　Also denounced were counter-revolutionary bandits such as Yang Jujun and Chen Jiaqing. Yang Jujun was a Kuomintang "Military Intelligence Bureau" professional secret agent who served as the bandit "Police Precinct Chief" in Taipei City, Taiwan and was a major culprit in the "February 28th" incident, the massacre of over 10,000 Taiwanese people. Over 500 Taiwanese people were arrested by him, strangled with ropes, tied with stones, and thrown into the sea. Chen Jiaqing was the action team leader of the Kuomintang "Military Intelligence Bureau" special agent organization and was the perpetrator who personally assassinated Yang Jie, a democratic figure invited to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in Hong Kong on September 19, 1949.

　　Ou Jian, the wife of Situ Dong, who was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, tearfully recounted the atrocities of the special agents' killing of the people. She said that her husband was collectively massacred by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents one day before the liberation of Guangzhou. After liberation, she went to Liuhua Bridge to excavate her husband's remains, digging four pits and unearthing a total of 52 bodies, some with brains spilling out, some with protruding eyes, bloody and unrecognizable. She pounded the denunciation platform and demanded, "The People's Government should avenge my husband and avenge the thousands upon thousands of dead compatriots!" Woman Ma Jingrong denounced, "House number 8, Siheng Road, Xinhepu, Dongshan, in this city, is where Chiang Kai-shek's special agents murdered my husband, Zhang Yizhong. When I fished his body out of the well, it was covered with spotted wounds. The body was packed in a burlap sack, still handcuffed and shackled, tied with thick hemp ropes, and with tape stuck over his eyes. This is how my husband was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. I want to educate my two children who have lost their father to remember this blood feud."

　　The victims' tearful denunciations aroused the audience's anger, and everyone unanimously demanded the resolute suppression of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. Finally, Huang Yiping, the chief of the military law department of the city military control commission, announced the death sentence for these counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes, and the entire audience erupted in cheers.

　　广州各界人民代表三万余人集会
    愤怒控诉反革命分子罪行
    一批反革命首恶分子当场判处死刑
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：广州市人民于四月二十五日举行控诉反革命分子罪行大会。参加大会的有全市各界人民代表三万余人和远在数百里外的四会县人民所组织的控诉团，并有市民七十万人及广东省各地人民群众同时收听大会实况广播。
    会上，叶剑英市长作了关于镇压反革命的报告。国家原告检察机关代表谭政文对反革命罪犯提起公诉后，罪大恶极的反革命罪犯姚宝猷、周东、余志德、陈家庆、杨举钧等十五名匪徒被押送到场。在全场高呼“枪毙反革命匪徒”声中，曾受这批特务匪徒残害的人们开始了血泪的控诉。
    被美蒋飞机炸死的市民们的家属，控诉了特务余志德的罪行。余匪在去年三月三日美蒋飞机轰炸广州时，用红布做标志，指示匪机轰炸目标。因此，市民数百人被炸死或炸伤，房屋五百六十四间被毁，一百多艘船艇被炸沉，数千人因而家破人亡。寡妇何妹登台控诉时已哭不成声。她的二十岁的女儿和十一岁的儿子都被炸死，她的脚也被炸成残废。她说：“特务余志德害得我好惨，人民政府一定要把他枪毙！”市民邹诚信一家被炸死七人，他控诉时愤恨地说：“母亲在病榻上嘱咐我：‘我们一定要报仇！’今天害得我家破人亡的余志德已拿到了，人民政府一定要给我们报仇才好。”台下立刻喊出：“杀绝该杀的特务，为死难的同胞报仇！”
    民主人士秦元邦、梁若尘，曾受迫害的中山大学学生洪斯溢、冯训瑜和死难学生家长陈美等，向大会控诉了满手是青年学生鲜血的广州“五、卅一”血案制造者、“中统”广东三大特务头子之一的姚宝猷的罪行。姚匪是国民党“中统”特务组长、匪“广东省教育厅长”。一九二七年即担任匪“潮梅区清党委员会委员”，曾残杀进步青年李春涛、巫丙喜等多人。一九四六年五月四日，姚匪在布置“反苏反共大游行”的同时，亲自指挥特务捣毁香港华商报广州分馆、兄弟图书公司和大公报广州营业处。一九四七年五月三十一日，广州全市学生举行“反内战、反饥饿、反迫害”的大游行，姚匪唆使特务流氓用大棒、铁钩等毒打游行学生，造成全国人民所不能忘记的“五、卅一”血案。同时，姚匪又指示特务封闭广州进步报纸每日论坛报，拘捕报社社长章导和职工四十多人。一九四九年七月二十三日，姚匪主谋逮捕中山大学员生一百六十八人，并先后暗中处死学生多人。被害学生家属陈美在会上哭不成声地说：“我要问一问姚匪，我的儿子浩明的尸首在那里？我要剥你的皮、剐你的骨，才能消除我心头的仇恨！”顿时，会场上“枪毙姚宝猷”的呼声彼落此起。
    四会县人民控诉团控诉了匪“戡乱建国委员会主任”周东的滔天罪行。周匪早在一九二七年即在广东率领反动武装配合匪首蒋介石叛变革命，屠杀共产党员萧楚女等四十余人。是年冬，国民党反动派曾残杀广州革命工人及群众达七、八千人，周匪即为血淋淋的刽子手之一。周匪二十多年来坚决反对革命，屠杀人民，直到解放前夕仍企图在广东四会县一带负隅顽抗，并肆行抢劫、奸淫和烧杀。四会县农妇陆瑞爱控诉说：“周东指挥土匪洗劫四会岗沙乡，全村被抢光，妇女被奸淫，连我一岁大的侄女也给刺刀刺死。国民党反动匪徒真没有半点人性。”老农民冯开要求立刻枪毙周匪，为死难弟弟报仇。
    被控诉的还有杨举钧和陈家庆等反革命匪徒。杨匪举钧为国民党“军统”职业特务，曾在台湾台北市任匪“警察分局长”，是“二、二八”事件屠杀台湾人民万余的大惨案中重要凶手之一。经他拘捕后用绳勒毙系石投到海里的台湾人民有五百多。陈匪家庆为国民党“军统”特务组织的行动组长，是一九四九年九月十九日在香港亲手刺杀应邀参加中国人民政治协商会议的民主人士杨杰的案犯。
    被蒋匪特务杀害的司徒栋的妻子欧健，哭诉了特务残杀人民的惨状。她说：她的丈夫是在广州解放前一天被蒋匪特务集体屠杀的。解放后她到流花桥去发掘丈夫遗骸，连挖四坑共挖出尸体五十二具，有的脑浆迸流，有的眼睛突出，血肉模糊，惨不忍睹。她捶着控诉台要求：“人民政府应该为我丈夫报仇，为千千万万死难同胞报仇！”妇女马景融控诉道：“本市东山新河浦四横路八号的一座房子，便是蒋匪特务杀害我丈夫张义忠的地方。当我从水井里捞起他的尸首时，遍身是斑斑的伤痕。尸体被装在麻袋里，仍扣着手铐脚镣，捆着粗麻绳，眼睛上贴着胶布。我的丈夫就是这样被蒋匪特务害死的。我要教育我两个失去了爸爸的孩子，要他们牢记住这血海深仇。”
    受难者们的血泪控诉激起了全场怒吼，大家一致要求坚决镇压蒋匪特务。最后市军管会军法处长黄一平宣布判处这些罪大恶极反革命分子死刑，全场欢声雷动。
