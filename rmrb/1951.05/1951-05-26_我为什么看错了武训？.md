　　Why Did I Misjudge Wu Xun? Editor:
　　Having continuously read the criticisms of "The Life of Wu Xun" published in the People's Daily, and after seriously studying them, my thinking has taken a step forward. What a joyful thing this is!

　　In 1947, I worked at the Wu Xun School in Linqing for a year and generally understood Wu Xun's deeds. Because his so-called "miracles," especially his "servile demeanor," "reliance on landlords," and "loan-sharking," did not satisfy me, and also seeing that the feudal rulers greatly praised and supported his behavior, I thought he was not an admirable figure. I adopted an indifferent attitude toward his so-called "miracles." However, in teaching, I often told students that Wu Xun's "dedication to his cause" could be a model for us to learn from, and even praised his lifelong struggle for the children of the working people. So, what caused such a mistaken understanding? I made the following self-criticism:

　　　　One, the lack of a truth-seeking attitude.

　　Some people, many of whom were teachers, believed that Wu Xun was a rare "entrepreneur" in history. He used his "perseverance" to do a good thing of "promoting education." At that time, although I had doubts about this in my mind, I blindly accepted some people's arguments, thinking that praising him would have a good effect. Now I have learned a lesson: not criticizing old things, not investigating the root causes, not clarifying right and wrong, and blindly accepting other people's opinions is not a truth-seeking attitude.

　　　　Two, judging Wu Xun solely from his class origin.

　　Wu Xun was born a hired peasant and later became a beggar due to persecution by landlords. I wrongly estimated that he had personally suffered the cruel oppression of the landlord class, so he might have had the idea of resisting the landlord class, and his founding of schools was for the convenience of poor children to study. I only started from his class origin and some phenomena, and I thought he was good, so I thought all his actions were good, forgave him for living in a feudal era, ignored the historical situation at that time, and did not even investigate what kind of school he was running. This was mainly judging everything about him based on his class origin, which is subjectivism.

　　　　Three, thinking that publicizing Wu Xun's suffering could enhance the peasants' anti-feudal sentiments.

　　Another thought of mine was that since Wu Xun was noticed by many people, and he was a poor man, using him as a concrete example could educate the peasants, thereby raising the peasants' class consciousness. This understanding was obviously wrong. It is a fact that Wu Xun suffered some oppression from the landlords, but there was no fact of resisting the landlords. His goal of struggle was not to overthrow the feudal forces but to run schools that served the feudal forces; not to strike at the enemy but to beg the enemy for alms and work for the enemy in order to obtain the so-called "righteous school land" bestowed by the enemy. He had become a supporter of feudal rule and had no qualities of the working people. Analyzing Wu Xun's entire history, not only can it not enhance the peasants' resistance to feudal forces and foreign aggression, but on the contrary, it is conducive to feudal rulers and numbs the peasants' fighting spirit.

　　　　Four, thinking that making students aware of the difficulty of Wu Xun's founding of schools could encourage students to study hard.

　　At that time, this kind of thinking existed. Therefore, in the "School Building Unit" teaching, when talking about labor viewpoints, cherishing public property, and studying hard on various issues, I linked it to praising Wu Xun, with the aim of making students appreciate Wu Xun's painstaking efforts in founding schools, in order to improve the enthusiasm for learning. This issue also obviously suppressed the students' revolutionary thinking. This time, watching the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," I heard a child say: "Wu Xun suffers so much from the landlords, why doesn't he get up and fight them?" From this reflection, we can see that the children are not satisfied with Wu Xun's behavior. It is wrong to stimulate students' learning enthusiasm by deviating from historical truth, and the consequences are hindering students' revolutionary thinking, which is harmful and unprofitable.

　　In summary, the discussion articles on "The Life of Wu Xun" gave me a great inspiration, making me clear about many issues in my thinking: First, it is not a scientific attitude to casually let go of such a fundamental issue, not delve into it, and blindly praise it by following others. Second, historical great figures should represent the interests of the masses and promote social development under the conditions of the time and history. Conversely, hindering social development and the path of historical progress, going against the tide, and violating the interests of the masses are historical sinners and shameful dregs. Third, we must comment on the value of a person's behavior from the effect. What role did Wu Xun's begging for education play at that time? What effect did it have? Undoubtedly, in that era, running schools of that nature and relying on feudal rulers and making all kinds of base and ugly behaviors, this fact only helped the feudal rulers and was harmful to the working masses. Fourth, to look at problems comprehensively, and to understand everything about Wu Xun one-sidedly from his origin, is a wrong way of thinking.

### 我为什么看错了武训？

　　我为什么看错了武训？编辑同志：
    连续看到人民日报发表对“武训传”的批判，经过认真学习，使我的思想提高了一步，这是多么愉快的事啊！
    一九四七年，我在临清武训学校做了一年工作，对武训的事迹大致了解一些。因为他的所谓“奇迹”特别是他的“奴颜婢膝”、“投靠地主”、“放债”，不能使我满意，而且又看到封建统治者也大加表扬与支持他这一行为，我思想上认为他不是什么可钦佩的人物，对他的所谓“奇迹”采取淡然处之的态度。但是，在教学时，我又常常向学生讲：武训的“事业精神”，可以做我们学习的榜样；甚至赞扬他一生为了劳动人民子弟而奋斗。所以造成这样一个错误的认识，原因在那里？我作了如下的检查：
            一、不是实事求是的态度。
    有些人，其中很多是教员，认为武训是历史上少有的“事业家”；他以“坚忍”精神，办了一件“兴学”的好事。当时虽然我思想上对此存在着疑问，但也盲目地接受一些人的论调，认为赞扬他，是能起好作用的。现在获得了一个经验教训：对旧的东西不加批判，不追究根源、弄清是非，盲目地接受别人的意见，就不是实事求是的态度。
            二、单从出身成份来看武训。
    武训出身是个雇农，后因受地主的迫害，流为乞丐。我曾错误地估计：他是亲受地主阶级残酷压迫过的人，就可能具有反抗地主阶级的思想，他兴学又是为了贫苦子弟念书方便。我只从他的成份出发，和一些现象来看，就认为他是好的，于是认为他一切行为都好了，原谅他所处是个封建时代，忽略了当时的历史情况，更没有追究他办的学校是一个什么性质的。这主要的是单从成份上臆断了他的一切，是主观主义的。
            三、认为宣传武训所遭受的痛苦，可以增强农民反封建的情绪。
    我的另一个思想是：武训既为很多人所注意，他是个穷人，拿他做具体的例子，可以教育农民，从而提高农民的阶级觉悟。这个认识很显然的是错了的。武训受过些地主的压迫是事实，但反抗地主的事实却没有。他奋斗的目标，不是推翻封建势力，而是兴办为封建势力服务的学校；不是打击敌人，而是哀求敌人施舍，替敌人办事，以求得敌人恩赐的所谓“义学正”。他已经成为封建统治的拥护者，毫无劳动人民的品质。拿武训全部历史分析来看，不仅不能增强农民反抗封建势力和外来侵略势力，相反地有利于封建统治者，麻痹了农民的斗争情绪。
            四、以为使学生认识武训兴学不易，可以激励学生认真学习。
    当时存在着这种思想，故在“建校单元”教学中，讲起劳动观点，爱惜公物，认真学习种种问题，就连系着赞扬武训，目的是使学生感念武训兴学的苦心，以提高学习情绪。这一问题显然也抑制了学生革命的思想。这次看“武训传”影片，我听到小朋友说：“武训这样受地主的气，为什么不起来和他干？”从这个反映看出小朋友的心情，是不满意武训的行为的。脱离历史真实去刺激学生学习情绪是错误的，其后果是妨碍学生革命的思想，是有害无利的。
    总起来说，关于“武训传”的讨论文章，给了我一个很大的启示，使我在思想上明确了许多问题：一、像这样的一个根本问题，就马马虎虎放过，不加深究，人云亦云地盲目赞扬，这样看待事物，不是科学的态度。二、历史上的伟大人物，应是要在当时当地和历史条件下，代表群众利益，推动社会发展。反之，妨碍社会发展与历史前进的道路，背道而驰，违反群众利益，就是历史上的罪人，可耻的败类。三、要从效果上评论一个人的行为的价值。武训行乞兴学，在当时起一个什么作用？得到什么效果？无疑在那个时代，兴那样性质的学校，并且投靠封建统治人物，作出种种卑劣丑恶的行为，这一事实只是帮助了封建统治者，有害于劳动群众。四、看问题要全面，单从武训的出身，片面地理解他的一切，是错误的思想方法。
