    A Happy Event for the Mongolian People
    The Mongolian People's Republic will hold elections for the Great Hural on June 10th. The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party issued a letter to all voters stating: "The unprecedented direct and secret ballot general election in our country's history is about to be held. In the upcoming Great Hural election, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party will form a close alliance with non-party farmers, workers, and intellectuals."
    This is a major event in the history of the Mongolian People's Republic. Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people will surely achieve a great victory in the upcoming election to consolidate the people's democratic regime.

    No Longer Hiding Their Schemes
    The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with Deputy Secretary of State Webb, military representatives, and representatives from the Economic Cooperation Administration, held a joint secret meeting on the 17th of this month. The "aid" bill was discussed at the meeting. It is now known that nearly $9 billion will be allocated for this "aid" in the coming budget year. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally told reporters that the main purpose of the Marshall Plan in the future is to promote military production, and that the United States will strive to find ways to make Europe produce more armaments.
    In fact, the Marshall Plan has militarized and colonized Europe since its inception.

    The Executioner of Saigon
    French High Commissioner for Indochina and Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps, Tassigny, ordered the execution of twenty Vietnamese hostages (including six women) in retaliation for the killing of Has, the head of the French secret police in Cholon, by Vietnamese patriots. This crime of the French colonialists of massacring innocent people will only arouse greater hatred among the Vietnamese people.

    蒙古人民的喜事
    蒙古人民共和国六月十日将举行大呼拉尔选举。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会发表告全体选民书说：“我国历史上空前的直接不记名投票的全民选举将要举行了。在即将到来的大呼拉尔选举中，蒙古人民革命党将与非党农民、工人和知识分子结成密切的联盟。”
    这是蒙古人民共和国历史上的一件大事，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党领导下，一定会在即将到来的选举中，为巩固人民民主政权而取得伟大的胜利。
    不再隐讳的图谋
    美国参院外交委员会与副国务卿韦伯、军事代表和经合总署的代表于本月十七日联合举行秘密会议。会上讨论了“援”外法案。据现在知道，在将来的预算年度内，将为这项“援助”共拨将近九十亿美元的款项。外交委员会主席康纳利对记者说：今后马歇尔计划主要目的在于促进军事生产，而且美国要努力设法使欧洲出产更多的军备。
    实际上，马歇尔计划从实行之日起就已使欧洲军事化和殖民地化了。
    西贡的刽子手
    法国驻印度支那高级专员兼法国远东军总司令塔西尼下令枪决了二十名越南的人质（其中包括六名妇女），作为对法国在茶叻的秘密警察头子哈斯被越南爱国志士杀死的报复。法国殖民者这种残杀无辜者的罪行只会激起越南人民的更大仇恨。
