The broad masses of farmers are displaying patriotic enthusiasm and actively combating drought to sow seeds. Cotton planting in North China has exceeded the plan by more than two million mu.

North China has achieved brilliant results in combating drought and planting cotton. The total cotton planting area in the region has exceeded the plan by more than two million mu. North China's cotton production accounts for 40% of the country's total cotton production. Since the beginning of spring this year, North China has been arid, especially the cotton-growing areas of Hebei and Pingyuan. Therefore, combating drought and planting cotton has become a serious political task. Leaders at all levels have attached great importance to this issue and vigorously launched a campaign to combat drought and plant cotton. The scale and speed of completion are unprecedented. Hebei and Pingyuan have jointly organized more than 10,000 cadres from the provincial, special district, and county levels to lead farmers in a concentrated rush to plant. The vice chairmen of the provincial people's government personally went to the countryside to inspect and promote the work. The secretaries of the CPC prefectural and county committees, as well as commissioners and county heads, went deep into districts and villages to lead, some personally checking the soil moisture in the fields and disseminating experience, and others personally helping the masses carry water for spot sowing. District and village cadres worked tirelessly day and night, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for sowing and strengthening their confidence in combating drought and planting.

Combating drought and planting cotton has been closely integrated with the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, mobilizing the patriotic production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Farmers have expressed: "Planting a few more mu of patriotic cotton will increase our strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea." "The soldiers on the front lines are shedding blood to protect us, so we must overcome difficulties and plant more cotton to support Korea." Therefore, a widespread campaign to combat drought and plant cotton has been launched, mobilizing men, women, old, and young to work together, develop water sources, and dig wells and canals in large numbers; rationally use wells, canals, and waterwheels; and organize manpower, animal power, and tools to invest in the campaign to combat drought and plant cotton. Many areas have taken advantage of the favorable conditions of heavy snowfall in the winter and light rain in the spring, researched technology, and launched "seize the moisture" and "borrow the moisture" to rush plant, breaking through the method of relying solely on carrying water for spot sowing, saving manpower and material resources, and winning time to successfully complete the cotton planting task. As of now, Hebei has exceeded the plan by more than 2.49 million mu, Pingyuan has exceeded the plan by 400,000 mu, and Shanxi has reached more than 90% of the plan. The total planting area in the region has exceeded the plan by more than two million mu. Currently, various places are taking advantage of the recent rainfall to continue rushing to plant and strive to complete and exceed even greater numbers.

This achievement fully proves that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party, the power of the broad masses has been brought into play, and the active idea of "man will conquer nature" has been promoted, finally achieving the first victory on this year's agricultural production front, which is of great significance for developing industry and supporting the Korean War. Currently, various places have shifted to checking seedlings, protecting seedlings, replanting seedlings, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and launching a concentrated effort to sow autumn crops. Leaders and cadres at all levels, as well as the masses, are making persistent efforts and waging unremitting struggles against disasters in order to strive for a victorious harvest.

　　广大农民发扬爱国热情积极抗旱播种
    华北植棉超过计划二百余万亩
    华北全区抗旱植棉，获得辉煌成绩，全区植棉总数，又超过计划二百余万亩。华北棉产量占全国棉花总产量的百分之四十。今年入春以来，华北亢旱，尤以河北、平原植棉区为甚。因此，抗旱植棉成为严重的政治任务。各级领导十分重视这个问题，大力开展了抗旱植棉运动，规模之大，完成之快，为前所未有。河北、平原共组织了省、专、县干部万余人，领导农民突击抢种；省人民政府正副主席亲自下乡检查推动；中共地委书记、县委书记和专员、县长深入区、村领导，有的亲自到地里验墒，传播经验，有的亲自帮助群众担水点种；区、村干部昼夜不眠，紧张工作，大大鼓舞了群众下种情绪，坚定了抗旱播种的信心。抗旱植棉密切结合了抗美援朝运动，发动了广大农民的爱国生产热情，农民纷纷表示：“多种几亩爱国棉，多增加几分抗美援朝力量”，“前方战士流血保卫咱，咱要克服困难多种棉，支援朝鲜”。因此，广泛地开展了抗旱植棉运动，发动男女老幼一齐动手，开发水源，大量打井、开渠；合理使用水井、水渠、水车；组织人力、畜力、工具，一齐投入抗旱植棉运动。许多地区利用了去冬雪大有底墒和今春曾落小雨的有利条件，研究了技术，发动了“趁墒”“借墒”抢种，突破了单纯依靠担水点种的办法，节省了人力、物力，争取了时间，胜利完成了植棉任务。截至目前，河北已超过计划二百四十九万余亩，平原超过计划四十万亩，山西已达计划百分之九十以上。全区种植总数已超过计划二百余万亩，现各地正趁最近落雨，继续抢种，争取完成与超过更大数目。这种成绩充分证明：在中央人民政府和共产党领导下，发挥了广大群众的力量，发扬了“人定胜天”的积极思想，终于取得了今年农业生产战线上的第一步胜利，这对发展工业和支援朝鲜战争都有重要意义。现各地已转入查苗、保苗、补苗、防治病虫害和突击大秋作物下种。各级领导和干部、群众，正再接再厉，和灾害作坚持不懈的斗争，以争取胜利丰收。
