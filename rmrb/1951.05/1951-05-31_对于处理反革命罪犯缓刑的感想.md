　　Thoughts on Handling Counter-Revolutionary Criminals with Suspended Sentences
　　Fu Huating
　　In the recent enlarged joint meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in the Beijing urban area, the government announced, as part of the handling of counter-revolutionary criminals, Chairman Mao's directive regarding sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve. This method of sentencing is an innovation in judicial work.

　　Counter-revolutionary criminals have already been sentenced to death, but are granted a two-year reprieve, during which they are subjected to forced labor, enabling them to produce and reform themselves through labor. This approach fully embodies the government's policy of combining suppression with leniency, and has a tremendous educational effect on the broad masses of the people.

　　When we heard Minister Luo Ruiqing's statement about "sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, to observe future performance," we felt that the government, in handling counter-revolutionary criminals, is still finding ways for those who have even a glimmer of hope for reform. This approach can give those who have committed counter-revolutionary crimes in the past, but not of the most serious kind, and who can be reformed, a very good opportunity to thoroughly repent and redeem themselves with merit.

　　In handling counter-revolutionary criminals, the government executes those who must be executed, and refrains from executing those who can be spared. For those who should be executed but are also capable of reform to some extent, this method of sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve is adopted. This spirit of combining suppression with leniency, this painstaking effort truly for the long-term interests of the country and the people, can only be achieved by the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　The Beijing business community unanimously supports Chairman Mao's wise instructions and unanimously supports the government in implementing these instructions.

　　对于处理反革命罪犯缓刑的感想
    傅华亭
    这次北京市区各界人民代表扩大联席会议中，政府宣布处理反革命罪犯内容里面，有毛主席指示的判处死刑，缓期二年的一点。这项处刑方法，在司法工作上是个创举。
    反革命罪犯已经被判死刑，又予以缓期二年，在这两年中，对他施以强迫劳动，使他生产，在劳动中改造自己，这项处理办法，充分体现了政府的镇压与宽大相结合的政策，对广大人民起了极大的教育作用。
    我们听到罗瑞卿部长报告中“判处死刑，缓期二年，强迫劳动，以观后效”的话，觉得政府处理反革命罪犯，对于只要有一线可以改造希望的人，政府仍是给他想办法。这项办法可以给一些过去曾经做过反革命的罪行，但还不算是最严重，而可以加以改造的反革命分子以一个很好的痛改前非，立功赎罪的机会。
    政府处理反革命罪犯，该杀的一定杀，可杀可不杀的就不杀。对于该杀而又在某些程度上可以改造的人，则采取这种判处死刑缓期二年的办法，这种镇压与宽大相结合的精神，这种真正为国家人民长远利益设想的苦心，也只有共产党领导下的人民政府，才能够做得到。
    北京工商界一致拥护毛主席这项英明指示，并且一致拥护政府贯彻执行这项指示。
