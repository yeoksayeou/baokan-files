Seriously Deal with the Problem of Old Serial Picture Books

　　Based on feedback from various locations, we have repeatedly pointed out the corrupting and poisoning effects of feudal, pornographic, and reactionary old serial picture books on children and adults with lower levels of education in the so-called "little picture book" stalls in cities across the country. These old serial picture books, which promote feudalism, pornography, and reaction, use the "little picture book" stalls in various locations as their base, with some backward publishers in Shanghai as their supply base. The two work together to allow these books containing toxins to develop to a considerable extent.

　　Taking two districts in Shenyang City as an example, among the serial picture books displayed and borrowed in the "little picture book" stalls, those with progressive content accounted for less than 20%, while those with backward and reactionary content accounted for more than 80%. The conclusion reached based on an investigation report from Xi'an is the same. In this city, "little picture book" stalls have developed to 300, owning more than 2,000 kinds of serial picture books, totaling about 60,000 copies. Investigation materials from a relatively typical stall prove that among all its 557 kinds of books, 1,336 copies, only 31 kinds of progressive books, 66 copies, plus more than 100 kinds of books with historical stories as their theme and harmless, about 200 copies, accounted for only 20% of the total; the remaining 80% were feudal, superstitious, pornographic, supernatural, horror, and reactionary content.

　　The situation is like this from the Northeast to the Northwest, and the same is true in North China, South China, and other regions. According to statistics, when these bad books are published in Shanghai, each edition prints 1,500 to 2,000 copies; about 500 copies are sold in South China, about 200 copies each in North China and Central China, about 200 to 300 copies in Northeast China, Northwest China, and East China, and hundreds of copies in Shanghai itself. It can be seen that its poison has spread throughout the country and has penetrated deeply into remote areas in large quantities. A book rental shop in Xi'an that sells this type of bad book ships as many as 10,000 copies to Lanzhou every month, and the farthest shipments reach the Wuwei and Zhangye areas, and then may be transferred to Xinjiang. Its monthly wholesale volume is no less than or even exceeds that of a state-owned serial picture book professional wholesale agency.

　　The distribution network of these bad books is closely linked to its supply base in Shanghai. Various places have a certain number of orders for each book, and there are even cases where money is remitted to Shanghai first and then the books are sent. This has fueled the publication of these bad books. These bad books are printed quickly, sold quickly, the capital turnover is fast, and they make money quickly, so they are called "running horse books" in Shanghai. There are about 20 backward publishers in Shanghai who operate "running horse books," and they secretly organize joint distribution agencies and establish "running horse halls." These publishers, who poison people's minds and simply seek profits, also know that they cannot be forgiven by the people. On the copyright pages of some poisonous books that promote aggressive wars and promote the destruction of humanity, it is noted that they are published by Qingji Bookstores in Hong Kong and Taiwan, etc. Other methods of "stealing the sky and changing the day" are even more numerous.

　　The Second Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress in mid-April paid attention to this issue. Publishing industry representative Shu Xincheng correctly pointed out that among these harmful reading materials, "a large part is due to the lack of political awareness and speculation among colleagues, and some are due to counter-revolutionary elements mixing in and deliberately doing so." The people of Shanghai have begun a thorough struggle to ban the publication of reactionary serial picture books, and the people of Shanghai have begun to condemn backward publishers who steal and print poisonous books (such as Zhoujia Bookstore, Fuji Bookstore, Xiyin Bookstore, Yinghua Publishing House, and Lianyi Bookstore, as revealed in issue 13 of this journal). The government agencies in Shanghai have also taken steps to deal with the publication of old serial picture books, distinguishing between the importance and urgency of the issues. These methods are timely and necessary.

　　All parts of the country should support this meaningful struggle being carried out by the people of Shanghai. All parts of the country should seriously attach importance to the handling of old serial picture books. The main reason for this phenomenon is that we have not paid enough attention to the compilation and publication of serial picture books, that we have not had enough unity and leadership over the serial picture book stalls in various places, and that we have not paid enough attention to the distribution of new serial picture books. Therefore, we must make up for these shortcomings.

　　First of all, improving and strengthening the compilation and publication of new serial picture books is urgently needed. Our writers and publishers must never be satisfied with existing achievements. When we know that since liberation we have only published more than 1,000 kinds of new serial picture books, while at the same time more than 1,000 kinds of serial picture books with toxins have also been published, and that all the old serial picture books amount to 28,000 kinds, we should know how important this work is. We still have many shortcomings in compilation and drawing techniques to overcome; we must make our publications truly welcomed by the masses.

　　Secondly, transforming the serial picture book stalls is also important. Some cities have already done it, uniting the stall vendors and raising their awareness; some cities have not yet done it. Experience has proven that when carrying out this work, we must adopt persuasive education methods and effectively help them do it in a planned and step-by-step manner to achieve the goal. Commandism, one-sided banning, and rash actions are all wrong. The first step should be to "comprehensively inspect the old serial picture books circulating on the market and deal with them separately according to their different situations: confiscate and destroy the extremely reactionary ones, and reduce and eliminate those feudal, superstitious, pornographic, supernatural, obscene, and thieving works in a planned and step-by-step manner, and conduct regular spot checks of children's books. Experience has also proven: "Organizing the children's book stalls nearby, from the participation of children's book stall practitioners in the anti-US and aid-Korea demonstrations in the publishing industry, and the fact that they are consciously willing to organize for transformation and progress, it can be seen that the vast majority of them love the country, are close to the People's Government, and can be won over and united for transformation." (Xi'an) We should organize them on the basis of their awareness, give them good leadership, and should no longer "not take them seriously" (Shenyang stall vendors' words). At the same time, experience has proven that starting from a central city can affect nearby cities. For example, after the disposal measures were taken in Shenyang, the "little picture book" stall operators in Jinzhou immediately organized a meeting on their own initiative, formulated a covenant, and guaranteed not to rent out "little picture books" with reactionary content, and to purchase new serial picture books when purchasing goods. These experiences are very valuable.

　　Again, all new serial picture books should be sold at the lowest possible price and vigorously promoted and distributed. According to reports from local newspapers and other materials, there are the following situations: "'Running horse books' are priced lower than new serial picture books, so the book stalls are unwilling to buy new serial picture books." "'Running horse book' promoters carry books to the book stalls every day to sell and can allow large amounts of arrears." (Wenhui Daily, Shanghai, April 25) "Progressive reading materials generally still remain in government agencies, schools, and libraries, and have not yet been widely disseminated to various children's book stalls and among the masses." (Xi'an Mass Daily, April 23) More seriously: "The 'little picture book' stalls are not all willing to rent out old ones, and want new ones that are popular with the masses, but don't know where to buy them; on the contrary, Xinhua Bookstore still has inventory and is afraid of not being able to sell them." Until after paying attention to this issue, "giving the 'little picture book' stalls certain bookkeeping and preferential treatment methods, and providing convenience, the distribution volume of new 'little picture books' has increased greatly, and the proportion of old 'little picture books' in the market is gradually decreasing." (Shenyang) The bureaucratism and passive waiting for customers in our distribution work must be overcome. In our distribution work, we should learn that set of business methods, because doing so is beneficial to the people.

　　Only by working hard in all aspects in this way can we cut off all the networks of poisonous reading materials that spread throughout the country and penetrate the masses, can we guarantee that the meaningful struggle of the people of Shanghai against harmful reading materials will achieve consolidated victory, and can we systematically drive out the old serial picture books that promote feudalism and reaction from all its bases and positions.

　　严正处理旧连环图画问题
    我们根据各地反映，曾一再指出在全国各城市的所谓“小人书”摊中，封建、色情、反动的旧连环图画对儿童以及文化程度较低的成年群众的腐蚀与毒害作用。这些宣传封建、色情、反动的旧连环图画是以各地的“小人书”摊为阵地，而以上海某些落后的出版商为它们的供应基地。两者交相为用，使这些含有毒素的书籍发展到相当猖獗的程度。
    以沈阳市两个区为例，在“小人书”摊上陈列、借阅的连环图画中，内容进步的还不到百分之二十，而内容落后、反动的，竟占了百分之八十强。根据西安的调查报道，所得的结论是一样的。在这个城市中，“小人书”摊已发展到三百家，共拥有连环图画两千余种，约有六万余册。从一家比较典型的书摊的调查材料证明：在其全部书籍五五七种，一三三六册中，进步的书籍只有三十一种，六十六册，加上其他一些以历史故事为题材尚无害处的书籍一百多种，二百来册，总数亦仅占百分之二十；其余百分之八十都是封建、迷信、色情、神怪、恐怖、反动的东西。
    从东北到西北的情形是这样，华北华南及其他地区也是一样。据统计：这些坏书在上海出版时，每版印一千五百册至二千册；其销路华南约五百册，华北、华中各约二百册，东北、西北、华东共约二、三百册，上海本市数百册，可见其毒害已蔓延全国，而且大量深入僻远的地区。西安一家经营这类坏书的租书铺，每月发往兰州的多至一万多册，最远的发至武威、张掖一带，而后可能转入新疆。它的每月批销额不下于甚至超过了一家公营的连环画专业批销机构。
    这些坏书的发行网和它在上海的供应基地联系得是那样密切，各地对于每一本书都有一定数量的定货，甚至还有先汇款到上海后寄书去的情形。这就助长了这些坏书的出版。这些坏书印得快，销得快，资金周转快，赚钱快，于是在上海被称为“跑马书”。经营“跑马书”的落后出版商，在上海有二十家左右，他们并暗中组织联合发行机构，成立“跑马厅”。这些毒害人民思想、单纯牟利的出版商，自己也知道他们是不能见谅于人民的，在有些鼓吹侵略战争、鼓吹毁灭人类的有毒书的版权页上，就注明是香港、台湾庆记书局出版等等，其他“偷天换日”的手法更是不一而足。
    四月中旬举行的上海市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议注意到了这个问题。出版界代表舒新城正确指出：在这些有毒害的读物之中，“固然大部分是由于同业中的政治认识不够，投机取巧而然，也有是由于反革命分子混迹其间，而有意这样干的”。上海人民已经开始了彻底查禁反动连环画的出版的斗争，上海人民已经开始了对偷印毒书的落后出版商（如本刊第十三号所揭露的周家书店、福记书局、惜阴书局、影华出版社、联益书局等）的谴责。上海的政府机关也已经有步骤地、分别轻重缓急地处理旧连环画的出版问题。这些办法都是适时的，必要的。
    全国各地应该支援上海人民所进行的这一有意义的斗争。全国各地应该严正地重视旧连环画的处理问题。这一现象之所以造成，主要原因是由于我们对于连环图画的编绘出版工作重视不够，是由于我们对各地连环图画书摊的团结领导不够，是由于我们对新连环图画的发行工作注意不够。因此，我们必须在这几方面进行补救。
    首先，改善并加强新连环图画的编绘出版，是迫切需要的。我们的作家和出版家绝不要满足于已有的成绩。当我们知道解放以来我们仅仅出了一千多种的新连环画，而同时期有毒素的连环画也出了一千多种时，而且所有的旧连环画竟达二万八千种时，我们就应该知道这个工作是何等重要了。我们还有许多编绘技术上的缺点待克服；我们必须使我们的出版物真正为群众所欢迎。
    其次，改造连环图画书摊工作，也是重要的。有些城市已经做了，团结了摊贩们，并提高了他们的自觉；有些城市还没有进行。经验证明：在进行这项工作时，必须采用说服教育方式，切实帮助他们有计划、有步骤地去做，才可以达成。命令主义、片面取缔、急躁从事，都是不对的。第一步，应该“全面检查市面上流行的旧连环画，并根据其不同情况分别予以处理：没收和销毁极端反动的，有计划、有步骤地减少和消灭那些封建、迷信、色情、神怪、诲淫诲盗的作品，并经常进行小儿书的抽查工作。经验也证明：“把小儿书摊就近组织起来，从小儿书摊从业者参加出版界抗美援朝示威游行，以及自觉地愿意组织起来改造和进步这些事实看来，他们绝大部分是热爱国家，靠近人民政府，可以争取团结改造的。”（西安）我们应该在他们自觉的基础上，加以组织，善予领导，不该再“不把他们放在眼里”（沈阳摊贩语）。同时，经验又证明：从一个中心城市做起，可以影响到附近城市。例如，在沈阳采取了处置以后，锦州市的“小人书”摊业者马上自动组织会议，自己订立公约，保证不出租反动内容的“小人书”，进货时要进新连环画等。这些经验都是很可宝贵的。
    再次，一切新连环图画应该尽量降低售价，大力开展发行。据各地报纸以及其他资料所反映的情况，有如下几种：“‘跑马书’的书价低于新连环画，书摊便不愿意买进新连环画。”“‘跑马书’的推销者每天持书向书摊兜销，并可大量欠款。”（四月二十五日上海文汇报）“进步读物一般还停留在机关、学校、图书馆里，还未普遍深入到各个小儿书摊中去，群众中去。”（四月二十三日西安群众日报）更严重的是：“‘小人书’摊并不都愿意出租旧的，想要新的受群众欢迎的，不知上那去买；相反的，新华书店还有存货，嫌卖不掉。”直到开始注意了这个问题以后，“给‘小人书’摊一定的记账、优待办法，并给予方便，新‘小人书’发行量大增，市场上旧‘小人书’的比重逐渐下降着。”（沈阳）我们发行工作中存在着的官僚主义，等客上门主义，必需要努力加以克服。我们在发行工作中，应该学会那一套做生意的方法，因为这样做，对人民是有利的。
    我们只有这样从各方面努力做去，才可以斩断蔓延全国、深入群众的有毒读物的一切网络，才能够保证上海人民反有害读物的有意义的斗争获得巩固的胜利，才能够有步骤地把宣传封建、反动的旧连环图画从它的一切基地与阵地中驱逐出去。
