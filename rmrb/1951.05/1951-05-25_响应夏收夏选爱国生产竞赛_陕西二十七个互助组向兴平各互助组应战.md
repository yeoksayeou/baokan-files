Responding to the Summer Harvest and Summer Seed Selection Patriotic Production Competition

Shaanxi's 27 Mutual Aid Teams Challenge All Mutual Aid Teams in Xingping

In response to the patriotic production competition for summer harvest and summer seed selection, twenty-seven mutual aid teams in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, and Huangjia Village in the suburbs of Xi'an City have challenged forty-seven mutual aid teams in Xingping County. The conditions of the challenge from the fourteen mutual aid teams in Wangmang Village are: to complete the harvest of all wheat fields within three days, and to thresh, winnow clean, and dry the wheat. In order to prevent fire, wind, rain, and sabotage by bandits and special agents, the fourteen mutual aid teams jointly decided that during the wheat harvest, militiamen would patrol and stand guard in shifts every night; after the wheat was brought to the threshing ground, each family would have one person guarding the ground; before and after the harvest, smoking and playing with fire would be strictly prohibited in the fields and on the threshing ground. They have now fully prepared the straw stalks for wind and rain protection. In terms of seed selection, it is stipulated that wheat varieties such as "Big Red Head," which are resistant to wheat midges and wind and rain, should be selected, and methods such as removing mixed varieties, retaining pure varieties, and selecting single ears should be used for selection.

The challenge conditions of the thirteen mutual aid teams in Huangjia Village are: to prepare all necessary large and small farm tools, vehicles, and other tools for the summer harvest before the 25th day of the fourth lunar month; during the wheat harvest, to guarantee that the fields are cleared within three days (it took five days in previous years) and the threshing ground is cleared within fifteen days (it took one month in previous years); and to select and retain wheat varieties that are resistant to wheat midges. Each team also formulated a public pledge for fire prevention and anti-espionage: no matches or tinder are allowed on the threshing ground, and one or two water tanks must be placed on each threshing ground; all villagers' militia are divided into two shifts to patrol the main and small roads near the threshing ground to prevent sabotage and theft by bandits, special agents, and thieves.
