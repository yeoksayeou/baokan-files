　　Anyang Special District Fully Mobilizes the Masses
　　Confiscates Hidden Weapons of Counter-Revolutionaries

Comrade Editor:

　　In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province vigorously publicized the special commissioner's "Notice on Confiscating Hidden Weapons of Counter-Revolutionary Elements and Civilian Guns." On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, the work of confiscating weapons was carried out. From March 1 to April 15, a total of 365 rifles and pistols, 3,877 rounds of ammunition of various sizes, and hundreds of other weapons were confiscated.

　　Turning the confiscation of weapons into a mass movement is the main reason for this achievement. For example, before carrying out the confiscation work, the People's Government of the Third District of Qi County first mobilized the masses to recall the harm that secret agents and bandits had done to the people's lives and property by firing black guns and robbing roads, and explained to the masses that if the weapons of the counter-revolutionary elements were not completely confiscated, production and social order would be threatened. Then, the masses started a discussion, and everyone realized that only by confiscating the weapons of the counter-revolutionary elements and letting the militia master them could we protect production, defend the fruits of liberation, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was heightened. Many people took the initiative to investigate materials and report to the government. At the cadre meeting in Xigang, 78 hidden rifles and pistols were reported. A landlord in Dache Village kept more than a dozen mortar shells but refused to admit it; as a result, the masses investigated and found out the truth. A person from Zaoyuan Village who had served as a puppet soldier was forced to take out a gold-hook gun buried underground for more than two years after being accused and confronted by the masses. Many farmers also voluntarily handed over the weapons they had kept, such as Jing Tingfu, a middle peasant from Huangfu Village, who handed over six rifles; a middle peasant from Doujie handed over a pistol, saying: "Now I feel relieved."

　　Correctly implementing the policy of combining suppression with leniency is also an important reason for the smooth progress of the weapon confiscation work. For example, Anyang County first publicized the government's policy beforehand, stating that those who hide guns can only reduce their guilt by voluntarily handing them over. In this way, some people handed over their guns. However, many gun hiders had previously written a statement to the government: "If there are guns, I am willing to be severely punished." This time, seeing the power of the People's Government and the supervision of the masses, they intended to hand over the guns; but they were afraid of violating their previous words. After discovering this ideological concern, the Anyang County People's Government announced the principle of "no punishment for handing over now; heavier punishment for concealing," so that they could dispel their worries and hand over the guns voluntarily. The County People's Government resolutely suppressed those stubborn elements who had guns but refused to hand them over, thus promoting the disintegration of the enemy. For example, after Anyang Ninth District executed the counter-revolutionary element Zhang Ziping, who refused to hand over his gun, other counter-revolutionary elements bowed their heads to the people and handed over their guns. In this work, Anyang County confiscated a total of 222 rifles and pistols.

### 安阳专区充分发动群众  收缴反革命分子的暗藏武器

　　安阳专区充分发动群众
    收缴反革命分子的暗藏武器编辑同志：
    平原省安阳专区在镇压反革命运动中，大力宣传了专署“关于收缴反革命分子暗藏武器及民间枪枝通告”，在充分发动群众的基础上，开展了收缴武器的工作。从三月一日到四月十五日，共缴出长短枪三百六十五枝，大小子弹三千八百七十七粒，其他武器数百件。
    把收缴武器工作形成群众性的运动，是这次获得成绩的主要原因。如淇县三区人民政府在进行收缴工作之前，先发动群众回忆过去特务、土匪打黑枪、路劫对人民生命财产的危害，向群众说明不收净反革命分子的武器，生产和社会秩序就要受到威胁。接着，群众就展开了讨论，大家认识到只有收净反革命分子的武器，让民兵掌握在手里，才能保卫生产，保卫翻身果实，巩固人民民主专政。于是，群众的积极性提高了。很多人主动调查材料，向政府报告。仅西岗基点干部会上，就告发出隐藏的长短枪七十八枝。大车村一地主保存了十余发迫击炮弹，死不承认；结果被群众调查清楚。枣园村一个曾经当过伪军的，在群众告发对证下，被迫拿出埋在地下二年余的金钩枪。不少农民也自动献出保存的武器，如皇甫村中农靖庭福献出了步枪六枝；豆街中农献出了手枪一枝，他说：“这一下我可心轻了。”
    正确执行镇压与宽大相结合的政策也是使收缴武器工作顺利进行的一个重要原因。如安阳县事前先宣传了政府的政策，提出藏匿枪枝者只有自动交出，才能减轻罪过。这样，就有一部分人交出了枪枝。但也有许多藏枪者，因过去曾向政府立了：“如真有枪，愿受严惩”的字据。这次看到人民政府的威力和群众的监督，有意交枪；但又恐犯了前言。安阳县人民政府发现这一思想顾虑后，宣布“现在交出，不咎既往；隐匿不交，罪上加罪”的原则，使他们解除顾虑，自动交出。县人民政府对确实有枪而坚拒不交的怙恶不悛分子，则进行了坚决的镇压，促使了敌人的分化。如安阳九区处决了拒不交枪的反革命分子张子平后，其他反革命分子纷纷向人民低头，将枪交出。安阳全县在此一工作中，共收缴长短枪二百二十二枝。
