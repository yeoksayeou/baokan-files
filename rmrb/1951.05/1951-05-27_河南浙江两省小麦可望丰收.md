　　Henan and Zhejiang Provinces Expect Good Wheat Harvests
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 26th] Henan and Zhejiang provinces are expected to have good wheat harvests. It is estimated that Henan Province's wheat yield this year will be about 80% of a normal year; Zhejiang Province's wheat yield may reach 90%.
　　Henan Province is a major wheat-producing area in China. Last winter, the wheat planting area accounted for about 77% of the total cultivated land area. Since this spring, rainfall in the province, except for some dry conditions in gully and ridge areas, has been generally well-distributed. In addition, with the broad masses of farmers launching patriotic production competitions, practicing intensive cultivation with more fertilizer, wheat growth has been good. According to estimates from Shangqiu, Chenliu, Huaiyang, Xinyang, Xuchang and other special districts, if no unexpected disasters occur before the wheat harvest, the average yield will be about 80% of a normal year. The wheat in Huaiyang Special District is particularly good, with large ears and plump grains, and the wheat stalks are strong, reaching a person's chest. At present, barley in the province has matured, and wheat will be ready for harvest in half a month. Farmers in various places are now busy repairing farm tools, rolling wheat threshing grounds, and preparing for the harvest; many districts and townships have also formulated wheat protection pacts to prevent counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging the wheat harvest.
　　This year, the average wheat yield in Zhejiang Province is 90% of a normal year, an increase of 20% compared to last year. Now, farmers throughout the province are busy harvesting wheat, and barley has already been brought to the threshing ground in some areas.

　　河南浙江两省小麦可望丰收
    【新华社二十六日讯】河南和浙江两省小麦丰收有望。据估计，今年河南省小麦约有八成年景；浙江省小麦产量可达九成。
    河南省为我国主要产麦区，去冬麦田播种面积约占总耕地面积的百分之七十七。今春以来，该省除少部沟、岗地带稍呈旱象外，一般地区雨水调匀，加上广大农民开展爱国生产竞赛，实行精耕细作多施肥，小麦成长良好。据商邱、陈留、淮阳、信阳、许昌等专区估计，如麦收前不发生意外灾害，平均有八成年景。淮阳专区的小麦特别好，穗大粒实，麦棵茁壮，高及人胸。目前，该省大麦已成熟，小麦再有半月即可收割。各地农民现正忙着修整农具，碾压麦场，准备收割；许多区、乡并订出了护麦公约，防止反革命分子破坏麦收。
    今年浙江省的小麦平均有九成年景，比去年增产两成。现在，全省农民正在紧张地收割麦子，有些地区的大麦已登场。
