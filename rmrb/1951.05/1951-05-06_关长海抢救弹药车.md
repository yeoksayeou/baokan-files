   Guan Changhai Rescues Ammunition Car
   by Ying Tao

  (14) "We can't let these vehicles be wasted, we must rescue them!" He immediately jumped off the locomotive, put on his coat, and ran towards the artillery and medicine cars.

  (15) His high sense of responsibility left Guan Changhai no time to consider whether one person could move so many carriages. As he was anxiously standing beside the cars, he suddenly saw more than a hundred Korean People's Army soldiers walking by on the road next to him.
