　　Wu Xun's "Altruism" Benefits the Feudal Class

Editor:
　　After reading the articles criticizing "The Story of Wu Xun" recently published in the People's Daily, I deeply feel my own low level of political theory. Not only do I lack the ability to criticize this film that spreads poison, but I was also easily captured by its reactionary ideology.

　　After watching the movie "The Story of Wu Xun," I was deeply "moved," so I promoted it to everyone I met, saying it was a very good film, worth watching again and again.

　　At the time, I felt that Wu Xun's "asceticism to promote education" and "altruistic" selflessness, "thirty years as one day," were commendable and worthy of our good learning. I also felt that Wu Xun's "promoting education" to enable poor children to study was in line with the significance of eliminating illiteracy today. But I completely failed to consider what role Wu Xun's actions played at the time. Obviously, Wu Xun's "altruism" actually only anesthetized the oppressed people's awareness of resistance, and benefited the feudal ruling class. Wu Xun was able to "persist" in "begging to promote education" precisely because his approach conformed to the interests of the feudal ruling class and received the encouragement and support of feudal leaders. As for the schools Wu Xun established, they were only tools for the feudal ruling class to cultivate lackeys and slaves, and had nothing in common with the significance of eliminating illiteracy. In short, Wu Xun served the feudal ruling class. His actions just increased the strength of the then tottering feudal ruling class.

　　Reading the critical articles by comrades Yang Er and Jia Ji has greatly enlightened me on how to recognize a historical event, a historical figure, and how to apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to analyze things.

　　I hope the People's Daily will continue to publish comments on this issue, and summarize the results of discussions in various places, so that we can have a clearer concept of the character Wu Xun and the film "The Story of Wu Xun."

### 武训的“利他主义”是利于封建阶级

　　武训的“利他主义”是利于封建阶级编辑同志：
    读了人民日报最近发表的批判《武训传》的文字，我深深感到自己政治理论水平的低下。我不仅对《武训传》这部散布毒素的电影没有批判的能力，而且轻易地被它的反动思想俘虏了。
    我看过电影《武训传》之后，深受“感动”，于是逢人就宣扬，说这是一张非常好的片子，值得一看再看。
    当时我觉得：武训“苦行兴学”、“利他主义”的忘我精神，“三十年如一日”，是难能可贵的，值得我们很好地学习。又觉得：武训为使穷孩子能念书而“兴学”，也正与今天扫除文盲的意义正相符合。但我却完全没有考虑到武训这种行动在当时起了什么作用。很显然，武训的“利他”，实际上只是麻醉了被压迫人民的反抗意识，而有利于封建统治阶级。武训能够“坚持”“行乞兴学”，也正因为他的作法符合于封建统治阶级的利益，得到封建头子的鼓励和支持。至于武训兴的学，只是为封建统治阶级培养走狗和奴才的工具，与扫除文盲的意义毫无共同之点。总之，武训是为封建统治阶级服务的。他的行动正好增加了当时摇摇欲坠的封建统治阶级的力量。
    读了杨耳同志和贾霁同志的批评文章，使我对于如何认识一个历史事件、历史人物，和如何应用马克思列宁主义的观点来分析事物，有了很大的启发。
    我希望人民日报继续刊载关于这一问题的评论文字，并且能将各地讨论的结果总结出来，使我们能对武训这人物和《武训传》这部电影有更明确的概念。
