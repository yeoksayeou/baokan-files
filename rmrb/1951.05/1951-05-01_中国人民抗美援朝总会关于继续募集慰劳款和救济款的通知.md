　　Notice from the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea Regarding Continuing to Raise Comfort and Relief Funds
    In order to慰劳the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and to relieve the Korean victims who have suffered from the ravages of the American invading army, this committee issued calls on December 4th of last year and January 14th of this year to all sectors of the country to launch a donation campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea. Thanks to the joint efforts and enthusiastic donations of compatriots from all walks of life, good results have been achieved. In addition to a large number of uncounted materials, as of April 21st, direct donations to the General Committee have reached over 90 billion RMB, specifically:
    (1) East China Region: 53,785,836,363 RMB. Accounting for 59.37% of the total donations.
    (2) Central and South China Region: 16,111,177,6572 RMB. Accounting for 17.79% of the total donations.
    (3) North China Region: 9,124,859,657 RMB. Accounting for 10.07% of the total donations.
    (4) Southwest China Region: 7,987,333,149 RMB. Accounting for 8.83% of the total donations.
    (5) Northwest China Region: 2,114,281,143 RMB. Accounting for 2.34% of the total donations.
    (6) Inner Mongolia Region: 144,577,672 RMB. Accounting for 0.16% of the total donations.
    (7) Northeast China Region: 43,850,762 RMB. Accounting for 0.05% of the total donations.
    (8) Other: 1,266,577,989 RMB. Accounting for 1.39% of the total donations.
    Total: 90,579,093,307 RMB.
    The majority of these donations have already been used to慰劳the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, who are fighting the American bandits in Korea to defend the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, or to relieve Korean victims. The effect on boosting the morale of the front lines and solving the difficulties of the Korean victims is very significant. In order to continue to expand the Resist America and Aid Korea movement and to continue to provide慰劳to the soldiers at the front, it is hoped that the local Resist America and Aid Korea sub-committees will unite with all sectors of society to continue to launch a large-scale donation campaign. To achieve this goal, this movement will be extended from the cities to the vast countryside. This donation movement should be entirely based on voluntary participation and should not involve any coercion. The General Committee will publish the income and expenditure of past donations in the newspapers. Local general sub-committees and sub-committees (including counties and districts) are also expected to publish the donations of money and materials received in appropriate ways. Specific measures will be notified separately by the General Committee.

    为了慰劳中国志愿军和朝鲜人民军，为了救济遭受美国侵略军残害的朝鲜灾民，本会曾于去年十二月四日与今年一月十四日号召全国各界发起抗美援朝的捐款捐物运动。赖各界同胞的共同努力热情捐献，已获良好成绩。除大批物资不计外，截至四月二十一日止，直接汇到总会的捐款，已达九百余亿人民币，计：
    （一）华东区：五百三十七亿八千五百八十三万六千三百六十三元整。占总捐款数百分之五九点三七。
