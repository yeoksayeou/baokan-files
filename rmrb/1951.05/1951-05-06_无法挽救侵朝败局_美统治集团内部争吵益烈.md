　　Unable to Salvage the Defeat in Korea
    Infighting Intensifies Within the US Ruling Group
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 5th] The continued development of infighting within the American ruling class over the dismissal of MacArthur increasingly exposes the pessimism and disappointment of the American imperialists regarding the future of the Korean War.
    MacArthur himself delivered what the Associated Press called a "sensational" speech in Chicago on April 26th. This ever-defeated general confirmed in his speech that the so-called "war of attrition," which the United States has been heavily promoting, is causing increasingly heavy losses to the American invading forces. He admitted that these losses "have reached an alarming level" and are "gradually increasing at a rate of thousands per month."
    This revelation by MacArthur immediately caused turmoil within the US ruling group. Republican Congressman Reed demanded that Congress investigate MacArthur's statement. Another Republican Congressman, Shaferik, said: "Now, we are being pushed back again in Korea, and undoubtedly, we have suffered terrible losses." He criticized the Truman administration for "only having one... unattainable policy." Republican Senator Welker believed that throwing American troops into the Korean War "without any hope of victory" was simply "insane."
    At the same time, Republican Senate leader Wherry introduced a bill in Congress calling for an expanded investigation into the MacArthur dismissal to determine whether Acheson should be removed from office and whether Truman had the right to launch the Korean War last June. Republican Senator Case also introduced a bill simply calling for the abolition of the State Department. Another Republican Senate leader, Taft, expressed that his confidence in the US military chiefs of staff had been "shaken."
    The Republican side's complaints and attacks greatly embarrassed the ruling Democratic Party. The Democratic Party tried its best to smooth things over. The Democratic National Committee specifically published a booklet entitled "Why the President Fired MacArthur - The Official Record." In explaining the publication of this booklet, Democratic National Committee Chairman Boyle blamed "some political leaders, newspapers, and radio commentators who have been determined to try to confuse the issue" and cursed Republican leaders for making "almost unprecedented slanderous remarks" in an attempt to "score political points." Democratic Senator Douglas vehemently called for "abandoning the fierce partisan struggle over foreign policy."
    However, because the defeat in the Korean War is staring them in the face, and neither side of the dispute can come up with a solution to salvage the situation, even the United Press said that this dispute will continue to develop and "will not calm down."

### 无法挽救侵朝败局  美统治集团内部争吵益烈

　　无法挽救侵朝败局
    美统治集团内部争吵益烈
    【新华社五日讯】美国统治阶级内部关于撤免麦克阿瑟事件的争吵的继续发展，愈益暴露美帝国主义者对于侵朝战争前途的悲观失望。
    麦克阿瑟本人于四月二十六日在芝加哥发表了一篇被美联社称之为“轰动一时”的演说。这位常败将军在演说中证实，美国大事吹嘘的所谓“消耗战”，正在使美国侵略军遭到日益惨重的损失。他承认这种损失“已达到令人吃惊的程度”，而且还“正在以每月数千人的速度逐渐增加”。
    麦克阿瑟这一透露立即在美国统治集团内部引起了骚动。共和党众议员李德要求国会就麦克阿瑟这一声明进行调查。共和党另一众议员沙利克说：“现在，我们在朝鲜又在被击退，毫无疑问的，已遭到了可怕的损失。”他抨击杜鲁门政府“只有一种……不能实现的政策”。共和党参议员威尔克认为，把美国军队投入“没有胜利的希望”的侵朝战争中简直是“发疯”。
    与此同时，共和党参院领袖惠利在国会中提出了一项议案，要求扩大对于撤免麦克阿瑟事件的调查，以确定是否应该撤艾奇逊的职以及杜鲁门是否有权于去年六月发动侵朝战争。共和党参议员凯斯也提出了一项法案，干脆要求撤消国务院。另一共和党参院领袖塔夫脱则表示对美国的军事参谋首长的信任已经“动摇”。
    共和党方面的埋怨和攻击使得执政的民主党大感窘迫。民主党竭力企图使事情消弭下去。该党全国委员会特地发行了一本小册子，题为《总统为什么把麦克阿瑟免职——官方案卷》。民主党全国委员会主席鲍埃尔在解释这本小册子的出版时责怪“有一些政治领袖、报纸及广播评论员曾决心努力混淆这个问题”，并咒骂共和党领袖们发表了“几乎是空前的诬蔑言论”，是想“捞一笔政治资本”。民主党参议员道格拉斯声嘶力竭地呼吁“放弃对外交政策的剧烈的党派斗争”。
    但是，由于侵朝战争败局摆在面前，而争吵双方又都提不出挽救的办法，所以，连合众社也说，这种争吵将继续发展下去，“不会平静下来”。
