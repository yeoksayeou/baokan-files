Xinhua News Agency: At a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands of people in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, President Gottwald delivered a speech stating: "In the past year, the peace camp has become particularly strong. Humanity has never shown such determination to prevent new wars as it does now in the world peace movement. The predatory aggressors have met with heroic resistance from the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Chinese People's Volunteers are assisting their Korean brothers while also defending the freedom and independence of their motherland. We express our warmest support and respect to the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, because they are wiping out the mercenary armies of the American aggressors."

　　捷总统在庆祝五一节大会上演说
    向中朝人民致敬
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格数十万人参加的示威大会上，捷总统哥特瓦尔德发表演说称：“在过去一年中，和平阵营已特别壮大起来了。人类从来没有表现过像现在在世界和平运动中这样不容许新战争发生的决心。掠夺的侵略者遭到了朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军的英勇抵抗。中国人民志愿军援助朝鲜的弟兄，同时也就是保卫他们祖国的自由与独立。我们对于英勇的朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军表示最热烈的声援与敬意，因为他们正在消灭美国侵略者的雇佣军队。”
