Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, May 3rd: The armed sabotage activities of the Uthman bandit leader, an armed spy of US imperialism, under the direction of US imperialist spies Paxton, the former US Consul in Dihua, and Vice Consul Mackinnon, have been confessed by Uthman in the People's Court one by one. These facts confessed by the Uthman bandit once again prove the towering crimes of US imperialism in invading and undermining our country's sovereignty.

The confession of the Uthman bandit leader is as follows:

"The 'Beitashan Incident' that occurred in June 1947 was plotted single-handedly by Mackinnon, the US government's Vice Consul in Dihua. Mackinnon organized my troops to cooperate with a regiment of the Fifth Cavalry Army of Song Xilian, the Kuomintang's Xinjiang Garrison Commander, to invade Hargeit, Altong Uba, Rashti and other places on the border of the Mongolian People's Republic. On the first day of fighting at Haraiti, Mackinnon was surveying maps on the top of the mountain. Because the army of the Mongolian People's Republic fired in self-defense, Mackinnon was so frightened that he rolled down from the top of the mountain. The maps he drew, his hat and binoculars were all lost on the top of the mountain. Later, I sent someone to help him retrieve them. The next day, Mackinnon personally participated in the battle at A Jin Tong Touba, drew a battle map and returned to Dihua. This was the task given to Mackinnon by the US government, attempting to cover the eyes and ears of people all over the world and create an anti-Soviet excuse. Fifteen days later, under Mackinnon's instigation, we continued to attack Rasht, a place in the Mongolian People's Republic, and suffered repeated defeats. Mackinnon came to command again and withdrew the Kuomintang army to Hebukejin in Ulanbulak, south of Beitashan. The 'Beitashan Incident' provoked by the United States in Xinjiang thus failed. But the United States was not reconciled. In June 1948, Mackinnon and Song Xilian summoned me to Dihua and formed an 'Anti-Communist, Anti-Soviet, Anti-Three Districts (referring to the Ili, Tacheng, and Ashan districts) Revolutionary Committee', appointing me as the deputy chairman. Mackinnon told me to organize a Kazakh battalion to be stationed on the border between Ashan and the Mongolian People's Republic, to gather intelligence and wait for an opportunity to attack the Three Districts. I returned to Santai and organized three Kazakh battalions, serving as the commander-in-chief. In the spring of 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army won victories throughout the country. At this time, Mackinnon was very alarmed and came to Santai several times to order me to expand my power. In April of the same year, Paxton came to Santai again. With Urhang’er as the translator, he instructed me to have close contact with Aysha, Emin, Yaolebos, Maisiwude, Janimuhan, and others. Paxton said: 'Although the Kuomintang leaders have obtained a lot of assistance from the United States, they have used the weapons aided by the United States to arm the Communist Party, making the Communist Party's strength strong. The Kuomintang is about to be defeated. I hope you will unite, don't have disagreements, and make good use of the assistance the United States gives you to oppose the Communist Party and oppose the Three Districts.' The next day, Paxton took photos of me, my wife, and my children, and then returned to Dihua. After accepting this task, I took advantage of the People's Liberation Army not entering Xinjiang, and looted wildly in Qitai, Fuyuan, Fukang, Muleihe, Changji and other places as capital for later armed rebellion. Mackinnon also personally organized more than one hundred White Russian troops in the mountains of Fuyuan, specializing in probing Soviet and Three Districts intelligence, and frequently contacted me.

After Xinjiang announced its peaceful uprising in September 1949, Mackinnon led more than one hundred White Russian troops, including Shayilov, and fled to Wumashan, Fuyuan Mountain, to join me. After the meeting, I coerced 150 Kazakh herdsmen to flee to Zhenxi. Also coming with Mackinnon this time were Vasily and five others. Mackinnon convened a meeting of 25 people, including me, Janimuhan, Zidalihan Aji, Surta, Habas, Husayn, Shayilov, and Zywanzow, to discuss the rebellion plan. Finally, Mackinnon arranged the steps of the rebellion activities, instructing me to contact Yaolebos, Qiaojiafu and others to make trouble. Mackinnon once said to me: 'You and Janimuhan and others can go to the United States with me and let you participate in the United Nations General Assembly and raise the issue of the Kazakhs in Xinjiang. The United States agrees to do this, but you need to testify.' Because I was unwilling to leave this old root, Mackinnon's proposal was not realized. A few days later, Mackinnon handed over more than one hundred White Russian troops, including Shayilov, to me. In addition, he gave me 3,500 bullets, 130 taels of silver, six taels of gold, a good horse, and represented the United States in allowing me to be responsible for continuing to supply my needs. I sent Shalibai and four others, and 20 horses, to send Mackinnon to Keshhusein.

Accepting Mackinnon's instructions for rebellion activities in Xinjiang, I colluded with Janimuhan, Yaolebos and others to carry out armed rebellion after the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang."

The above facts are part of the confession of the Uthman bandit leader. US imperialist spy Mackinnon, the former US Vice Consul in Dihua, fled in fear of punishment on September 28, 1949, when Xinjiang announced its peaceful liberation. The Public Security Bureau of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government seized 90 pieces of typical high-grade explosives, 63 pieces of yellow explosives, telecommunications equipment specially used for espionage, and 1,835 bullets of various kinds from Mackinnon's residence.

　　乌斯满匪首供认罪行
    证明美帝国主义破坏我主权
    【新华社西安三日电】迪化讯：美帝国主义武装间谍乌斯满匪首，在美帝国主义间谍、美国前驻迪化领事馆领事派克斯顿和副领事马克南指使下所进行的武装破坏活动，已经乌匪在人民法庭上一一供认。乌匪所供认的这些事实，又一次证明了美帝国主义侵略和破坏我国主权的滔天罪行。
    乌斯满匪首的供词如下：
    “一九四七年六月发生的‘北塔山事件’，是美国政府驻迪化副领事马克南一手阴谋策划的。马克南曾组织了我的部队，配合国民党新疆警备总司令宋希濂所部骑五军一个团，向蒙古人民共和国边境的哈尔尕依特、阿尔同乌巴、拉斯提等地侵扰。第一天在哈拉依提作战时，马克南在山顶测绘地图，由于蒙古人民共和国军队鸣枪自卫，马克南吓得从山顶上滚下来，他绘的地图、戴的帽子和望远镜，都失落在山顶上。后来还是我派人帮他取回的。第二天在阿金同托乌巴打仗，马克南亲自参加，绘好作战地图返回迪化。这是美国政府交给马克南的任务，企图以此掩盖全世界人民的耳目，制造反苏借口。十五天后，我们在马克南的策动下，继续向蒙古人民共和国的拉西特地方进攻，连遭挫败，马克南又亲来指挥，将国民党军撤至北塔山南之乌兰布拉克之禾布客金。美国在新疆挑起的‘北塔山事件’就这样失败了。但美国并没有甘心，一九四八年六月，马克南与宋希濂又把我召到迪化，组成‘反共反苏反三区（按指伊犁、塔城、阿山三区）革命委员会’，委我任副委员长。马克南叫我组织哈萨克族大队，驻守阿山和蒙古人民共和国边界，刺探情报，俟机进攻三区。我回到三台组织成三个哈族大队，自任总指挥。一九四九年春，中国人民解放军在全国范围获得胜利，此时，马克南甚为惊惶，曾数次到三台来令我扩展势力。同年四月，派克斯顿又来三台，由乌颃尔当翻译，指示我与艾沙、伊敏、尧乐博斯、麦斯武德、贾尼木汗等密切联系。派克斯顿说：‘国民党的头目虽然取得了美国的许多援助，但是他们把美国援助的武器倒把共产党武装起来了，使得共产党的力量变为强大。国民党将要被打垮了。我希望你们之间要团结，不要闹意见，好好使用美国给你们的援助，以此反对共产党，反对三区’。第二天，派克斯顿拍了我和我的妻子、儿子的照片后，返回迪化。我接受这任务后，乃趁人民解放军未入新疆之际，在奇台、孚远、阜康、木垒河、昌吉等地大肆抢劫，作为后来武装叛乱的资本。马克南并在孚远山内，亲自组织白俄军百余名，专门刺探苏联及三区情报，与我经常联系。
    一九四九年九月新疆宣布和平起义后，马克南率领白俄军沙买以洛夫等一百余名潜逃孚远山内乌麻善地方，与我会合。会合后我曾胁迫一百五十户哈萨克族牧民逃往镇西。这次和马克南同来的还有瓦西里等五人。马克南召集了我、贾尼木汗、子达力尔汗阿吉、苏尔塔、哈巴斯、胡赛音、沙买以洛夫、孜万索夫等二十五人开会，商讨叛乱计划。最后由马克南布置叛乱活动的步骤，指示我联络尧乐博斯、乔嘉甫等作乱。马克南曾对我说：‘你和贾尼木汗等人可同我到美国去，让你们参加联合国大会，提出新疆的哈族问题，美国是赞成这样做的，不过需要你们去作证明’。因为我不愿离开这个老根子，马克南的提议未得实现。过几天马克南把白俄军沙买以洛夫等一百余名交给我，此外还送给我子弹三千五百发，白银一百三十两，黄金六两，好马一匹，并代表美国允许负责继续供应我之所需。我曾派沙力白等四人及马二十匹，将马克南送到克什胡赛音处。
    我接受马克南在新疆叛乱活动的指示，乃于新疆和平解放后，勾结贾尼木汗、尧乐博斯等，进行武装叛乱。”
    上面这些事实，是乌斯满匪首供词中的一部分。美帝国主义间谍、美国前驻迪化副领事马克南，在新疆宣布和平解放时，即于一九四九年九月二十八日畏罪逃跑。新疆省人民政府公安机关在马克南寓所曾查出典型性高级炸药九十块，黄色炸药六十三块，间谍专用的电讯器材及各种子弹一千八百三十五粒等件。
