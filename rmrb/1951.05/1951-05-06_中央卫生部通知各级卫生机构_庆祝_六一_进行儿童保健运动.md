The Central Ministry of Health Issues Notice to All Levels of Health Institutions
Celebrating "June 1st" with a Children's Health Campaign

Xinhua News Agency
    The Central People's Government Ministry of Health issued a "Notice Regarding Celebrating the 1951 'June 1st' International Children's Day by Conducting a Children's Health Campaign" on April 26th. The notice requires health institutions at all levels across the country to actively cooperate with mass organizations at all levels to launch mass children's health campaigns, and to widely and deeply disseminate knowledge of protecting the health of infants and children to the working people through children's health check-ups.

    The notice requires that children's health education in various regions should focus on infant and young children's food hygiene and the prevention of smallpox and measles. The methods can include holding children's health education weeks, children's health exhibitions, and various forms of symposiums, and can also use pictures, newspapers, slides, pamphlets, etc. to assist in publicity. Regarding children's health check-ups, various regions should conduct them under possible conditions, focusing on the children of collective workers under the age of seven, scattered military families, the children of martyrs' families, and the children of rural working people with sanitary facilities. For the shortcomings discovered during the check-ups, appropriate corrections should be made based on the actual situation, focusing on those that urgently need correction and are likely to be effective. Medical and health institutions with the conditions should also establish regular children's health clinics or counseling centers. After this campaign, local health authorities should, depending on the circumstances, try to mobilize or assist villages and industrial and mining areas to open busy season nurseries and industrial and mining nursing rooms to promote children's health and reduce the burden on working women.
