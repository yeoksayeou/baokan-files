The Huai River Control Committee Holds Meeting
Preliminary Outlines of Key Projects for This Winter and Next Spring and Draft Project Plans

The second meeting of the Huai River Control Committee was held in Bengbu from April 26th to May 2nd. This meeting briefly summarized the Huai River control projects of last winter, inspected and estimated the ongoing spring projects, and preliminarily proposed the key points of the Huai River control projects for the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, and drafted a plan for the Huai River control projects for this period.

Zeng Shan, Director of the Huai River Control Committee, said at the opening of the meeting: Since last winter, the Huai River control work has made considerable achievements and gained many valuable experiences. These achievements are the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on fundamentally controlling the Huai River, the correct decision of the Central People's Government's State Council on governing the Huai River, the strong leadership of leading organs at all levels, and the hard work of the vast numbers of administrative and technical cadres and laborers. Director Zeng pointed out that the recent visit of the excellent Soviet water conservancy expert, Bukov, to assist the Huai River Control Committee has greatly helped the Huai River control project.

Zeng Xisheng, Deputy Director of the committee, reported to the conference on the overview of the Huai River control projects last winter, the plan for the Huai River control projects this spring, and the preliminary experience since the start of the Huai River control work. Deputy Director Zeng stated that the massive Huai River control project had been planned and prepared by the three provinces along the Huai River, namely Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu, before and after the conclusion of the Huai River Control Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Water Resources last year, ensuring the smooth construction of the project. The Huai River control project last winter and this spring is unprecedented in the history of Huai River control. A total of more than 94 million cubic meters of earthwork is planned to be completed last winter and this spring. More than 14 million cubic meters have been completed last winter, accounting for about 15 percent of the entire project last winter and this spring. This spring's Huai River control project is not only unprecedented in scale, but also has started many new projects, some of which must be completed before the arrival of the summer flood season. Therefore, the construction time is extremely tight. In addition to the planned earthwork projects such as flood storage, dike restoration, and dredging of more than 80.06 million cubic meters this spring, there are also 200 million cubic meters of earthwork for midstream ditch projects, 76 gates and dams in the upper and middle reaches, 7 reservoirs, and 155 gully dams (small projects to build dams in mountain valleys to block water). All projects started successively from late February to early March, mobilizing more than 1,687,000 laborers. As of late April, a total of more than 60 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed. As cadres and laborers have gained considerable construction experience from the winter project last year, patriotic education to resist the United States and aid Korea has been widely carried out after the start of the spring project, and the contradiction between the Huai River control project and agricultural production has been appropriately resolved. As a result, the project has progressed relatively quickly, and labor efficiency has generally doubled compared to last winter.

Based on the hydrological data of the three major floods of the Huai River in 1921, 1931, and 1950, as well as the results of Deputy Director Zeng Xisheng's personal survey of the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River, the meeting preliminarily proposed the key points of the Huai River control project from the winter of 1951 to the spring of 1952, and drafted a project plan. The meeting decided that the only task of governing the Huai River in 1952 would be to eliminate flood peaks. All engineering plans will aim to achieve this task.

The meeting lasted for six days. The attendees included Zeng Shan, Director of the Huai River Control Committee; Deputy Directors Zeng Xisheng, Wu Zhipu, Hui Yuyu, Liu Chongguang; Committee members Wu Jue, Huang Yan, Wang Huzhen, Qian Zhengying, Wan Jinpei, Lin Yishan, Lu Xuebin; and those attending the meeting were the heads of departments and divisions of the Huai River Control Committee, as well as water conservancy experts, engineers, and representatives from various special districts in Northern Anhui, totaling more than 60 people. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of the Central Ministry of Water Resources, and Li Baohua, Deputy Minister, also personally provided guidance.

　　治淮委员会举行会议
    初步提出今冬明春工程要点和目前工程计划草案
    治淮委员会第二次委员会议于上月二十六日至本月二日在蚌埠举行。这次会议对去年冬季的治淮工程作了简要的总结，对目前正在进行的春季工程作了检查和估计，并初步提出一九五一年冬季与一九五二年春季的治淮工程要点，拟订了这一时期的治淮工程计划草案。
    治淮委员会主任曾山在这次会议的开幕时说：自去年冬季以来，治淮工作已有了相当大的成绩，并且得到许多宝贵的经验。这些成绩是毛主席根治淮河的英明指示和中央人民政府政务院关于治理淮河的正确决定，以及各级领导机关的坚强领导，广大的行政、技术干部和民工们的艰苦努力，共同奋斗的结果。曾主任指出：最近苏联优秀的水利专家布可夫亲自来治淮委员会协助工作，对治淮工程的帮助极大。
    该会副主任曾希圣向大会报告了去年冬季治淮工程的概况与今春治淮工程的计划，以及治淮工作开始以来的初步经验。曾副主任称：治理淮河的巨大工程，早在去年中央水利部召开的治淮会议结束前后，河南、皖北及苏北等三个沿淮河的省区即有计划地进行了有关治淮的各项准备工作，保证了工程的顺利施工。去冬今春的治淮工程，在治理淮河的历史上是空前巨大的。总计去冬今春共拟完成九千四百余万土方。去冬已完成了一千四百余万公方，约占去冬今春全部工程的百分之十五。今年春季的治淮工程不但规模空前巨大，而且开始了许多新的工程，有的工程必须在今夏汛期到来以前完成。因此，施工时间异常紧迫。总计今春除拟完成蓄洪、复堤、疏浚等土方工程八千零六十万余公方外，并有中游沟洫工程土方二亿公方，上、中游闸坝七十六座、水库七座、谷坊（在山谷中筑坝拦水的小型工程）一百五十五座。全部工程均于二月下旬至三月初先后动工，动员民工达一百六十八万七千余人。至四月下旬止，已共完成土方六千余万公方。由于干部、民工皆从去年冬季工程中得到了相当的施工经验，春季工程开始以后，又广泛地进行了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，并适当地解决了治淮工程与农业生产的矛盾，因而工程进展比较迅速，劳动效率普遍较去冬提高了一倍。
    会议依据一九二一年、一九三一年及一九五○年三次淮河大水的水文资料，以及曾希圣副主任在淮河中、下游亲自勘察的结果，初步提出一九五一年冬季到一九五二年春季的治淮工程要点，并拟订了工程计划草案。会议决定：一九五二年度治理淮河的唯一任务，将是消灭洪水峰。一切工程方案都将以达成这一任务为目的。
    这次会议共历时六天，出席会议的有治淮委员会主任曾山，副主任曾希圣、吴芝圃、惠浴宇、刘宠光、委员吴觉、黄岩、汪胡桢、钱正英、万金培、林一山、陆学斌，列席的有治淮委员会各部、处长及水利专家、工程师，以及皖北各专区代表等共六十多人。中央水利部傅作义部长及李葆华副部长，亦曾亲临指导。
