　　Grandma Xu's Old Eyes Have Been Opened
	Fu Dong

　　The No. 5 District mass propaganda team was speaking for an entire afternoon, and just as their mouths were parched and they wanted a drink of water, suddenly an old white-haired woman emerged from the small door of No. 11 behind the Ministry of Justice Street. She was carrying a pot of water, running over hurriedly, and enthusiastically grabbing the team members' hands, saying, "Comrades, you've worked hard, please have some water!" She was out of breath from running, and her face was flushed red. Some people in the team who knew her were surprised and quietly talking among themselves, "Isn't that Grandma Xu? How did she come out?"

　　Seventy-one-year-old Grandma Xu used to hobble around on her bound feet all day, from the inner room to the outer room, hugging this grandson, touching that granddaughter, seeing if they were thinner or fatter today. When she had some free time, she would close her eyes and calculate how to make ends meet. When the neighborhood committee asked her to attend a meeting, she would say that she was deaf and couldn't hear, or that she had a headache and couldn't go.

　　In the second half of last year, a Mrs. Dong moved into her courtyard. Mrs. Dong was the chairman of the women's general representative of the Fifth Police Station and a member of the Resist America, Aid Korea Committee. Grandma Xu saw Mrs. Dong through the glass window, always so busy that she forgot to eat one meal after another, sometimes working until 11 o'clock at night before cooking dinner. She felt that Mrs. Dong was a bit "silly."

　　One day, Grandma Xu and Mrs. Dong met in the courtyard. They nodded to each other and started chatting. Grandma Xu said with concern, "Mrs. Dong, you are busy all day, and the government doesn't give you millet, so why bother? You can't resign from it!" When the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda team first came to Grandma Xu's house to promote their cause, Grandma Xu mumbled, "I am an illiterate old woman, almost in the grave, what do I care about resisting or aiding?" The propaganda staff frowned when they saw Grandma Xu, because no matter how nicely you spoke, she just ignored you, or said, "I am deaf, I can't hear."

　　Mrs. Dong and Grandma Xu gradually became acquainted and often visited Xu's home, making things quite lively with their warm greetings. Mrs. Dong compared the present life with the past life and chatted with her.

　　Gradually, they also talked about the days when Japan ruled. Whenever she mentioned that period, Grandma Xu was so sad that she wanted to cry. She would never forget the days of standing in line in the pitch-black night to buy mixed flour, nor the scene of the whole family getting dysentery, nor the painful experience of being forced to flee and not having anything to eat or drink on the boat for seven days and seven nights.

　　Mrs. Dong seized the opportunity to tell her, "The American devils are now arming Japan again and coming to fight us, wanting us to live the days of eating mixed flour again." Grandma Xu's face changed when she heard this. Her heart was cold and hot, up and down like a boiling pot, and she asked anxiously, "Don't say that, we can't let the devils come again! If the Japanese come, our good days will be over." Mrs. Dong then explained the significance of Resist America, Aid Korea to her in detail. After this explanation, the old lady had a basis in her mind.

　　After that, whenever the propaganda team came, the old lady would pull benches and chairs, asking questions. The old lady was also worried that China could not beat the United States because the United States had the atomic bomb. The propaganda staff addressed her concern by saying, "In the past, Japan and Chiang Kai-shek's planes and cannons were so powerful, but in the end, they were defeated by us, weren't they?" In addition, they talked a lot about the facts of the U.S. military's defeats in Korea. The old lady thought to herself: If Japan was capable, why could we defeat it? Now the United States has been defeated by us again, so it is clear that weapons alone are not enough.

　　The old lady also had a thought: in the past, she often heard people say that the United States ran schools, hospitals, and provided relief to the poor in China, but how could it suddenly become so bad now? After one comrade heard this, he told her about the atrocities of the United States helping Chiang Kai-shek with planes and cannons to kill our Chinese people and the U.S. military raping our Chinese women. This reminded the old lady of long-forgotten events. That was during the time when the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Beijing. She was only seventeen years old at that time. The American devils asked her grandfather for pretty girls. Her grandfather ignored them and was beaten until his mouth was full of blood. At that time, what she heard every day was not that this wife was raped by a foreign devil on the street, but that that twelve-year-old girl was gang-raped. The more the old lady thought about it, the angrier she became, and finally, she cursed, "They are truly beasts!"

　　On the 24th of last month, Grandma Xu listened to the accusations of women in Beijing. She started crying after hearing the first person's accusation. Later, she cried so much that she couldn't even lift her head, and her heart was as painful as being cut by a knife. She didn't even eat dinner and went to bed. How could she fall asleep! As soon as she closed her eyes, those tragic scenes appeared before her. That night, she lay in bed comparing the days of eating white flour and white rice now with the days of not having enough to eat during the Japanese devils' time. She felt that she was too selfish. All day long, she was thinking about her sons and grandsons, but she had never thought about the volunteer soldiers on the Korean battlefield who were defending the motherland and enabling the people to have white flour steamed buns. The more she thought about it, the sadder she became, and finally, she crawled on the bed and cried loudly.

　　From then on, Grandma Xu completely changed. As soon as it dawned, she cleaned the courtyard gate before tidying up her own room. She was so happy that she said to everyone she met, "The Resist America, Aid Korea movement has opened my old eyes!" "I lived for seventy years in the past, and now I finally have some light in my heart." She even hummed "Ke la la… Ke la la…" songs, as if she had become more than ten years younger.

　　Hearing that the Korean soldiers needed newspapers and books, she said to her son, "Let's save some money on vegetables and buy more books to send to them." Recently, she heard that the whole district was preparing for the "May Day" parade and insisted on participating. She said, "I have to go even if I die of exhaustion. I can't carry a rifle, but I can demonstrate. I have to go no matter what." Later, everyone persuaded her, and she discussed it with her daughter-in-law. She would take care of the four grandchildren at home so that her daughter-in-law could go to the parade. She is now drafting a patriotic pledge, expressing her intention to take good care of the children, cook well, and tidy up the courtyard and house, so that her son can work well and her grandsons can study hard. She also plans to publicize to several neighbors who, like her in the past, do not care about current affairs. She promises that in the future, she will attend any meeting she should attend. She said she had never been so happy.

　　徐老太太的老眼擦亮了
      傅冬
    五区群众宣传队，讲了一下午话，嘴正干渴得想喝点水时，忽然从司法部街后身十一号小门里闪出一位白发老太太，她提着一壶水，急急忙忙跑过来，热情地拉着队员的手说：“同志们辛苦了，请喝点水吧！”她跑得上气不接下气，脸涨得都有点发红了。队里一些认识她的人都惊奇地在悄悄交谈：“那不是徐老太太吗？她怎么也会出来？”
    七十一岁的徐老太太过去整天扭着双小脚，从里屋走到外屋，抱抱这个孙子，摸摸那个孙女，看看今天是瘦了？还是胖了？有点空，她就闭着眼盘算怎样过日子。街道上有事来喊她开会时，她不是说耳聋听不见，就是说头痛不能去。
    去年后半年，她的院子里搬来一位董太太，是第五派出所的妇女总代表的主任委员，又是抗美援朝委员会的委员。徐老太太从玻璃窗里看见董太太常是忙得吃了这顿，忘了那顿，有时忙到深夜十一点才烧晚饭，她便觉得董太太有些“傻气”。
    有一天徐老太太和董太太在院里碰见了，大家点了点头，就拉瓜起来，徐老太太挺关心地说：“董太太你整天忙得上气不接下气，政府又不给你小米，何苦来？你不能把它辞掉！”抗美援朝的宣传队第一次到徐老太太家宣传的时候，徐老太太嘴里则嘟囔着说：“我是个不识字的老娘们，都快入土的人啦，还管什么抗不抗，援不援的？”宣传人员一见徐老太太就皱眉头，因为你无论怎样好说歹说，她反正是一百个不理不睬，要不就是：“我耳朵聋，听不见。”
    董太太和徐老太太渐渐熟了，常去徐家串门，问寒问暖的搞得挺热火。董太太就以现在的生活和过去的生活对比，和她拉瓜起来。
    慢慢又谈起日本统治时候的日子。一提起那段日子，徐老太太就难过得要落泪。她永远忘不了那黑天半夜站着队去买混合面的日子，也忘不了全家拉稀病倒的情景，更忘不了被迫逃难，在船上七天七夜吃喝不到东西的惨痛遭遇。
    董太太就抓紧时机给她说：“美国鬼子现在要武装日本，又来打咱们，叫咱们过以前吃混合面的日子。”老太太一听脸就变了。心里一下子冷一下子热，七上八下像滚开了的锅，急着问：“说什么，也不能再叫鬼子再来呵！日本人来了，咱们的好日子就完了。”董太太于是就把抗美援朝的意义详细给她讲了讲。这一讲，老太太心里有了个底了。
    以后，宣传队伍一来，老太太就拉板凳、椅子，问长问短。老太太还担心中国打不过美国，因为美国有原子弹。宣传人员就针对她这个顾虑说：“以前日本和蒋介石的飞机大炮那么厉害，最后还不是被我们打垮了？”另外，又谈了不少美军在朝鲜吃败仗的事实。老太太心里就想：日本有本事为什么能叫咱打垮了，现在美国又叫咱打败了，可见光凭武器是不行的。
    老太太还有一个心思，就是过去常听人说：美国在中国办学校，设医院，救济穷人，但现在怎么一下子又变得那样坏了呢？一位同志听说后，就对她讲说美国帮助蒋介石飞机大炮杀害咱中国人和美军强奸我国妇女的暴行，这一下可又勾起了老太太早已忘记了的往事。那还是八国联军打北京的时候，那时她才十七岁，美国鬼子向她祖父要花姑娘，祖父不理，结果被打得满嘴鲜血。那时天天听到的不是这家太太在街上被洋鬼子强奸了，就是那家十二岁的小姑娘被轮奸了。老太太越想越气，最后诅骂起来了：“真是野兽！”
    上月二十四日，徐老太太收听了北京市妇女的控诉。她听了头一个人的控诉，就哭起来了。到后来哭得头都抬不起来了，心里像刀子割得一样痛。晚饭也没吃，就去睡了。那里能睡得着呀！一合上眼，那些悲惨的情景就出现在自己眼前。那一晚，她躺在床上把现在吃白面白米的日子，和在日本鬼子时吃不饱饿不死的日子比了比，她觉得自己太自私了。整天脑子里转的是自己的儿子、孙子，而对那些在朝鲜战场上为了保卫祖国、使人民有白面白馍吃的志愿军战士，自己就从没有想起过。她越想越难过，最后就爬在床上大哭起来了。
    打这以后，徐老太太就完全变样了。天一亮，把院子大门口打扫干净后，才收拾自己屋子。她高兴得见人就说：“抗美援朝运动把我的老眼擦亮了！”“过去我早活了七十年，现在心里才有了点亮。”嘴里还哼着“咳啦啦……咳啦啦”的歌子，好像年轻了十多岁。
    听说朝鲜战士很需要书报，她就对她儿子说：“咱们节省点菜钱，多买些书寄给他们。”最近几天来她听说全区正准备“五一”游行，便无论如何要去参加。她说：“我累死也得去，背枪杆我干不了，但我能示威，说什么也得去。”后来众人劝她，她就和她媳妇商量了一下，她在家看四个孙子，让媳妇好去游行。她现在正在订爱国公约，她表示要把孩子看好，把饭作好，把院子屋子收拾好，让儿子好好工作，孙子好好读书。她还计划向几个和她以前一样不关心时事的邻人作宣传。她保证今后开任何会，只要应该去的，她都去。她说她从来没有这样开心过。
