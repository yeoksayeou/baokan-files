　　Over 1.7 Million Workers Nationwide to Enjoy Labor Insurance Benefits Starting May 1st

According to statistics from sixty-one provincial and municipal labor bureaus and the two major enterprises of railways and post and telecommunications, more than 1.7 million workers in various regions will enjoy labor insurance benefits starting May 1st. The number of workers in sixty-six other provinces and cities who should be entitled to labor insurance benefits is still being tallied. The sixty-one provinces and cities that have reported their registration status to the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government for record include Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, and Dalian.

In the past two months, during the preparatory work for the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, local trade unions in various provinces and cities, as well as industrial trade unions in the railway and postal and telecommunications sectors, have held training courses for labor insurance cadres. Incomplete statistics from provinces and cities in East China, Yunnan, East Sichuan, West Sichuan, and Chongqing in the Southwest, and Shaanxi, Xi'an, and Dihua in the Northwest show that 3,569 labor insurance cadres have been trained through provincial and municipal-level training courses. The number of trainees in training courses held by grassroots trade unions in industrial and mining enterprises is even greater; the grassroots trade unions in industrial and mining enterprises in Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, and the Zibo mining area alone trained 8,500 labor insurance cadres. During the preparatory work, labor administrative organs and trade union organizations in various regions urged industrial and mining enterprises to strengthen medical facilities for workers. The number of beds in Jinan Workers' Hospital has been expanded from 70 to 200. Some factories and enterprises in Qingdao without medical facilities or with insufficient facilities have also temporarily found contracted hospitals. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient medical facilities, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau is working with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Health Bureau to organize all hospitals in the city into mutual aid groups to adjust equipment and technical deficiencies when necessary.

　　全国有一百七十多万职工
    五一起享受劳动保险待遇
    根据六十一个省、市劳动局和铁路、邮电两大企业的统计，各地有一百七十万以上的职工自五月一日起享受劳动保险待遇。另有六十六个省、市应享受劳动保险待遇的职工人数尚在统计中。已将登记情形报告中央人民政府劳动部备案的六十一个省、市中包括北京、上海、南京、青岛、济南、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、旅大等在内。
    两个月来，在实行劳动保险条例的准备工作中，各省、市地方工会和铁路、邮电产业工会都举办了劳动保险干部训练班。据华东区各省、市和西南区的云南、川东、川西、重庆四省、行署区、市以及西北区的陕西、西安、迪化等省、市的不完全统计，经省、市一级的训练班训练了的劳动保险干部即有三千五百六十九人。工矿企业基层工会举办的训练班里，受训人数就更多，仅青岛、济南、徐州、淄博矿区各工矿企业基层工会训练的劳动保险干部即有八千五百人。在准备工作中，各地劳动行政机关和工会组织督促各工矿企业加强职工医疗设备。济南市工人医院的床位由七十张扩充到二百张。青岛有些没有医疗设备或设备不足的工厂企业，也都暂时找好了特约医院。上海市人民政府劳动局为了解决医疗设备不足的困难，正会同该市总工会、卫生局，将全市所有医院分别组织成互助组，以便在必要时互相调剂设备与技术的不足。
