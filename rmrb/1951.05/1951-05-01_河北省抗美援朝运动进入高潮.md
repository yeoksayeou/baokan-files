　　Hebei Province Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement Enters Climax
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper  Dong Dong
　　Since April, the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in Hebei Province has gradually entered its climax. The breadth of mobilization and the size of gains have exceeded any previous mass movement.
　　Since the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial Branch of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Association issued instructions and announcements at the end of March to popularize and deepen the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement and prepare for the "May 1st" large-scale demonstration, the Chinese Communist Party organizations, people's organizations, enterprises, and cultural and educational institutions at all levels in Hebei Province have been working hard to achieve the above tasks. All units formulated specific plans for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea from top to bottom and implemented them at each level. Various meetings were held in various places to educate the vast number of cadres, so that they could deeply understand the great significance of popularizing and deepening the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the "May 1st" large-scale demonstration. For example, 30,000 cadres in the Tangshan area received patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and learned the specific methods of leading this work. According to the popularization plan, each area and county organized a large propaganda force and invested in this movement. The provincial and area cultural troupes and urban and rural performers generally went deep into villages and towns to carry out propaganda. Propaganda teams were generally organized in counties, towns, and cities. For example, Shijiazhuang City organized a propaganda team of 2,500 people, Tangshan City organized a propaganda team of 4,000 people, and Ji County organized two propaganda teams including 140 people. These propaganda teams, carrying movies, slides, pictures, and all propaganda tools, went deep into disaster areas, water towns, mountainous areas, remote villages, and streets to carry out propaganda. Reporters and propagandists in various places carried out activities in different areas according to their personal business conditions. From March 5th to April 12th, 487 propagandists in 59 villages in Daming County propagandized to the masses 12,160 times. The 2,500 provincial and municipal cadres and agency propagandists mobilized in Baoding City will also complete the task of popular education for all residents of the city.
　　Through the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, industrial and agricultural production and other work have been powerfully promoted. For example, in rural areas, the number of mu planted with cotton has been prominently increased, and the vast number of farmers are determined to fight drought and plant to complete the task of planting cotton. According to statistics from 226 villages in the fourth district of Hejian County, after education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, farmers increased cotton planting by 4,704 mu, and also formulated a covenant of "guaranteeing planting, guaranteeing output, and guaranteeing harvest." At the meeting of branch secretaries and propagandists convened by the Yuan Shi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they put forward the resounding slogans: "Organizing is strength, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea protects the country; victory on the Korean battlefield, we will complete the planting of cotton" and "Do not wait for rain, do not rely on the sky, organize to fight drought and plant cotton." Workers in various places are actively producing to welcome the "May 1st" large-scale demonstration. For example, the Yonghua Match Factory in Cang County area used to produce 44 boxes of matches per day, but now it has increased to 50 boxes. The Zhenhua Flour Mill in Ding County used to produce 400 bags of flour per day, but now it has increased to 592 bags. After the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement was launched, the people's vigilance was raised, and their hatred for counter-revolutionary elements deepened. The broad masses of the people actively assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For example, after the people of Sihe Street in Cangzhen signed a patriotic covenant, they reported 25 bad elements. Two women personally ran to the street cadres to report two spies. Resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has also promoted river work. For example, the 20-day river work task in Xingji, Cang County, was completed in four days; the 40-day river work task in Shuangliushu, Fangshan County, was completed in nine days. When collecting the first quarter's industrial and commercial tax, Cang County area completed and exceeded the task in ten days. Cangzhen arranged for collection on the first day, and completed it completely on the second day. From their practical experience, the vast number of cadres truly realized that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is indeed the driving force for all work. As long as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is done well, any work is easy to do.
　　In the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and preparing for the "May 1st" demonstration in April, there are the following experiences:
　　First, the popularization and deepening of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the preparation for the "May 1st" demonstration must unify ideological understanding and unified organizational leadership in order to achieve the due results. This requires correcting the thinking of some cadres who believe that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is opposed to production and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so that everyone can truly realize that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the driving force for all work. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always grasped this important link and has solved and is solving this idea from top to bottom. Experience proves that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is to defend our motherland, defend economic construction, and defend industrial and agricultural production; and developing industrial and agricultural production is precisely to increase the material strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea are two aspects of one work. Only by completely eliminating domestic counter-revolutionaries can we consolidate the fruits of victory of the people, encourage the people to actively produce, and enthusiastically participate in the ranks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In order to unify the above ideas, in addition to holding various meetings for education, and using recollection and accusation, or introducing examples of various places promoting various tasks through education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, these are good ways to open up thinking. Secondly, on the basis of unified thinking, unified organizational leadership must be implemented, a unified office must be organized, and manpower must be uniformly allocated. This method of unified thinking and unified organizational leadership is the main guarantee for popularizing and deepening the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
　　Second, giving full play to the role of cadres, Party and League members, propagandists, reporters, and intellectuals, holding good representative conferences on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and cultivating and using a large number of backbone elements from all walks of life are the main links in popularizing and deepening the movement, and representative conferences on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea are the best form for unifying various forces. Such meetings were held in large numbers throughout the province in mid-April, effectively giving play to various forces. At this kind of meeting, through reports, discussions, and recollection of accusations, all sectors have formulated their own plans and decided to carry out anti-American aggression and aid Korea propaganda through their own industries and strata. At this kind of meeting, the unity of people from all walks of life has been strengthened. For example, at the representative meeting in Cang County, Islamic Ahongs put forward "loving the country is loving the religion." At the representative meeting on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in Baoding City, people from industrial and commercial circles decided to mobilize their own women to participate in various activities to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
　　Third, in addition to organizing various propaganda forces, using various propaganda tools, and going deep into water towns, mountainous areas, and remote small villages, implementing a large-scale contracting system of contracting villages, households, and people is a good way to popularize and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This method is being promoted more widely throughout the province. For example, Baoding City stipulates the propaganda methods of reporters, propagandists, cadres, and party members contracting factories, contracting areas, contracting households, and contracting people, and has basically achieved the requirements of popularization.
　　Fourth, widely use propaganda tools such as movies, slides, drums, pictures, blackboards, and radio stations, and absorb various masses who do not easily participate in meetings, "send propaganda into the door and find people." In order to popularize the work among women, Party and League members and people from all walks of life should be mobilized to first mobilize their own women to participate in this movement, and women's work should be done by female cadres as much as possible. This is especially important in new areas.
　　In this broad movement, some areas still have many shortcomings or errors. First, individual county committees, due to their low political awareness, neglected the great significance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the "May 1st" parade, resulting in insufficient leadership and the danger of empty plans. For example, the Wuji County Committee believes that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is opposed to other work. Second, some district, village, and street cadres have the tendency of formalism and coercion. For example, in 44 villages in the sixth district of Qingyuan County, 22 villages simply held a mass meeting sloppily, found someone to accuse them, and then raised their hands to sign and vote and formulated patriotic covenants, but the masses did not quite understand what was going on. Coercion also appeared in individual areas. For example, when mobilizing the masses to vote in some villages in Hejian, they said: "If you don't vote against the United States arming Japan, you love the United States"; individual streets in Baoding City have forced people to learn songs. These are all tendencies that should be resolutely corrected.

　　河北省抗美援朝运动进入高潮
    本报特约记者  董东
    四月份以来，河北省的抗美援朝运动逐渐进入高潮，其动员力量之广，收获之大，超过过去任何一次群众运动。
    自中国共产党河北省委与河北省抗美援朝分会于三月底发出普及深入抗美援朝与准备“五一”大示威的指示与通告后，河北省中国共产党各级党的组织及人民团体、企业、文化教育机构，即为实现上述任务紧张地活动起来。各单位自上而下地制定了抗美援朝的具体计划，逐级贯彻。各地先后召开了各种会议，教育广大干部，使之深刻了解普及与深入抗美援朝和“五一”大示威的伟大意义。如唐山专区即有三万干部受到了抗美援朝的爱国教育，并学习了领导这一工作的具体方法。各专区、县即根据普及计划，组织了庞大的宣传力量，投入这一运动。省及专区的文工团和城乡艺人，普遍深入村乡宣传，各县镇与市区普遍地组织了宣传队，如石家庄市组织了二千五百人的宣传队，唐山市组织了四千人的宣传队，蓟县组织了包括一百四十人的两个宣传队，这些宣传队，携带电影、幻灯、图片及一切宣传工具，深入灾区、水乡、山区和偏僻村庄及街道进行宣传。各地报告员、宣传员都按个人业务情况，分区分工展开活动，大名县五十九个村的四百八十七个宣传员，自三月五号到四月十二号，向群众宣传一万二千一百六十次，保定市动员的二千五百名省市干部及机关宣传员，亦将完成全市居民的普及教育任务。
    经过抗美援朝运动，有力地推动了工农业生产及其他各种工作。例如，在农村，突出地增加了植棉亩数，广大农民决心抗旱点种，完成植棉任务。据河间县四区二百二十六个村统计，经过抗美援朝教育，农民增种棉花四千七百零四亩，还订出“保种、保出、保收成”的公约。中共元氏县委召开的支部书记和宣传员大会上，提出：“组织起来力量大，抗美援朝保国家；朝鲜战场打胜仗，咱们完成种棉花”及“不等雨，不靠天，组织起来抗旱种棉”的响亮的口号。各地工人们为迎接“五一”大示威，积极生产。如沧县专区永华火柴厂，过去每天生产火柴四十四箱，现增到五十箱。定县振华面粉厂过去每天生产四百袋面，现增到五百九十二袋。抗美援朝运动开展后，人民的警惕性提高了，对反革命分子的仇恨加深了，广大人民积极协助政府，镇压反革命。如沧镇四合街人民订立爱国公约后，检举密报了二十五个坏分子，两个妇女亲自跑到街干部那里密报了两个特务。抗美援朝也推动了河工工作，如沧县兴济二十天的河工任务，四天完成；房山县双柳树四十天的河工任务，九天完成。在征收第一季工商税时，沧县专区十天完成并超过任务。沧镇头天布置征收，第二天即扫数完成。广大干部从实际体验中，真正认识了抗美援朝确实是一切工作的动力，只要作好抗美援朝，什么工作也好作了。
    在四月的抗美援朝与“五一”示威准备工作中，有以下几点经验：
    第一、抗美援朝的普及深入与“五一”示威的准备，必须统一思想认识，统一组织领导，才能收到应有的成绩。这就要纠正某些干部认为抗美援朝与生产及镇压反革命等工作相对立的思想，使大家真正认识到抗美援朝是各种工作的动力。中共河北省委始终抓住这一重要环节，从上而下地解决了并解决着这一思想。经验证明：抗美援朝是为了保卫我们的祖国，保卫经济建设，保卫工农业生产；而发展工农业生产，正是为了增加抗美援朝的物质力量。镇压反革命与抗美援朝是一个工作的两个方面，只有彻底消灭了国内的反革命，才能巩固人民群众的胜利果实，鼓舞人民积极生产，并热烈地参加到抗美援朝的队伍中。为了统一上述思想，除召开各种会议进行教育外，并利用回忆控诉、或介绍各地经过抗美援朝教育推动各种工作的实例，这都是打通思想的好办法。其次，在统一思想的基础上，必须实行统一的组织领导，组织统一的办公室，统一调配人力。这种思想统一、组织领导统一的办法，是普及与深入抗美援朝的主要保证。
    第二、充分发挥干部、党团员与宣传、报告员、知识界的作用，开好抗美援朝代表会，大量培养与使用各界人民中的骨干分子，是普及与深入运动的主要环节，而抗美援朝代表会又是统一各种力量的最好形式。全省各地在四月中旬大量地召开了这样的会议，有效地发挥了各种力量。在这种会议上，经过报告、讨论、回忆控诉，各界都分别制定了自己的计划，决定通过自己行业、阶层，贯彻抗美援朝宣传。在这种会议上，各界人民的团结加强了。如沧县的代表会上，回教阿訇们提出了“爱国就是爱教”。保定市的抗美援朝代表会上，工商界人士决定发动自家妇女，参加抗美援朝的各种活动。
    第三、除组织各种宣传力量，使用各种宣传工具，深入水乡、山区、偏僻小村外，实行包村、包户、包人的大包干制，是普及与深入抗美援朝的一个好办法。这种办法全省正较普遍的推广。如保定市规定报告员宣传员及干部、党员包厂、包片、包户、包人的宣传方法，已大致达到普及的要求。
    第四、广泛使用电影、幻灯、大鼓、图片、黑板报、广播台等宣传工具，吸收各种轻易不参加会议的群众，“把宣传送进门，找到人”。为了普及妇女中的工作，应发动党团员及各界人士，首先动员自家妇女参加这一运动，妇女工作应尽量由女干部去作。特别在新区，这点更为重要的。
    在这一广大运动中，有的地区还是有许多缺点或错误的。第一、个别县委由于政治觉悟不高，忽视了抗美援朝与“五一”游行示威的重大意义，以致领导不足，计划有落空的危险。如无极县委认为抗美援朝与其他工作是对立的。第二、有的区村街干部犯有形式主义与强迫命令的偏向，如清苑县六区四十四个村中，有二十二村只是潦草地开了个群众大会，找人控诉了一下，就举手签名投票，并订立了爱国公约，而群众还不大明白是怎么会事。强迫命令在个别地区也出现了，如河间有的村动员群众投票时说：“不投票反对美国武装日本，就是爱美国”；保定市个别街道有强迫学歌曲现象。这都是应坚决纠正的偏向。
