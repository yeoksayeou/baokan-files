Promoting Superior Varieties to Increase Cotton Production
Hebei Province Expands Planting Area of Improved Cotton

The Department of Agriculture of the Hebei Provincial People's Government has increased the area sown with propagated superior cotton varieties this year by two times compared to last year. Last year, the province's superior cotton seed management areas harvested 760,000 mu, with an average yield of 120 jin of seed cotton per mu, 16 to 20 jin more than ordinary cotton fields. Areas with high yields, such as Linqing, Fengnan, and Shijiazhuang, averaged over 140 jin per mu. The quality of cotton was also significantly improved. The ginning percentage of superior varieties generally ranged from 33 to 36 percent, with Wu'an County reaching as high as 38 percent. Because the product quality of Sz-2 cotton was improved, each 100 jin could be sold for 50,000 to 60,000 yuan more. Therefore, this year, farmers in non-superior variety promotion areas are also eagerly purchasing superior varieties in preparation for planting. Based on this situation, the province has determined to establish 600,000 mu of superior variety propagation areas and expand ordinary promotion areas to 1.8 million mu in 1951. The combined area is two times larger than last year's planting area of improved cotton. The specific plan for increasing production and improving quality is as follows: in the superior variety propagation areas, the general requirement is 140 jin of seed cotton per mu, while Handan, Tangshan, Hengshui, Shijiazhuang, and other regions are required to produce over 180 jin of seed cotton per mu. In terms of quality, the uniformity of the cotton should reach 85 percent, the fiber length should be 15/16 of an inch or more, and the ginning percentage should be maintained at 33 to 36 percent. In the ordinary promotion areas of superior varieties, the general requirement is 110 jin per mu, uniformity of 70 to 80 percent, fiber length of 15/16 of an inch, and a ginning percentage of 33 percent or more. In order to ensure the completion of this plan, the Department of Agriculture proposed that, in addition to paying attention to improving the quality of superior varieties, the past mentality of simply preserving seeds should be corrected, attention should be paid to improving cultivation techniques, and a working policy combining increased production and seed preservation should be established.

　　推广优良品种提高棉花产量
    河北省扩大良棉种植面积
    河北省人民政府农业厅今年推广繁殖良种棉花播种面积较去年增加了两倍。该省棉花良种管理区去年收获面积七十六万亩，每亩平均产籽棉一百二十斤，比一般棉田每亩多产十六至二十斤。产量高的如临清、丰南、石家庄区平均都在一百四十斤以上。棉花质量也显著提高，良种花衣分一般都在百分之三十三到三十六，武安县最高达百分之三十八。斯字二比棉因产品质量提高，每百斤可多卖五、六万元，因此，今年非良种推广区的农民，也纷纷争购良种，准备播种。根据这种情况，该省确定一九五一年全省设置良种繁殖区六十万亩，扩大普通推广区到一百八十万亩。两项合计比去年良棉种植面积扩大了两倍。增加产量提高质量的具体计划是：在良种繁殖区内一般要求每亩产籽棉一百四十斤，邯郸、唐山、衡水、石家庄等地区要求产籽棉一百八十斤以上。在质量方面，棉花的整齐度要求达到百分之八十五，绒长十六分之十五英寸以上，衣分保持百分之三十三至三十六。在良种普通推广区，一般要求每亩产一百一十斤，整齐度百分之七十到八十，绒长十六分之十五英寸，衣分百分之三十三以上。为了保证完成这一计划，农业厅提出除注意提高良种的质量外，应纠正过去单纯保种的思想，重视栽培技术的改进，建立起增产与保种结合的工作方针。
