The Su Dianxuan and Luo Guangming Mutual Aid Teams
	Completed the Spring Patriotic Increase Production Plan After Accepting the Challenge from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team

The Henan Province's famous labor model Su Dianxuan Mutual Aid Team has completed its spring patriotic increase production plan and has formulated a summer production plan. Therefore, they recently wrote a letter to the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team and all labor models in the province to report their production achievements. The letter stated: Our team has hoed all 50-plus mu of wheat fields twice; this year, the team has sown 3.8 mu of cotton fields, and all cotton seeds have been soaked in warm water and mixed with green ash. The eight mu of spring tobacco fields have been plowed twice and harrowed once. When planting tobacco, because we adopted various seedling protection methods, all the tobacco seedlings have emerged and are growing particularly well. The team has accumulated a total of 465 cartloads of fertilizer, added 49 pieces of farming tools such as harrows and rakes, repaired four water wells, and added 40 waterwheels. In terms of sideline production, the team jointly opened a flour mill, added a tofu grinder, and raised 11 pigs; all team members have also joined the cooperative. In order to further rationally utilize semi-labor power, we have recently implemented a scientific division of labor based on the physical strength and expertise of each team member, upgrading the mutual aid team from purely agricultural production mutual aid to mutual aid in agriculture and sideline production. In the production competition, we actively promoted good farming techniques and new farm tools to the peasant masses. In two months, we taught 145 farmers in our township how to use 7-inch walking plows.

Our team, in order to welcome the summer harvest and summer planting, has formulated a summer production plan based on the spring production foundation: (1) In addition to early autumn land, we plan to plant 10 mu of tobacco on the 50-plus mu of wheat stubble land, and sow all the rest with late autumn crops; (2) During the wheat harvest, we guarantee to select 2,000 jin each of the "short two awn" and "red earthworm" improved wheat seeds from the fields. When sowing corn, we will use all the newly selected "horse tooth corn" improved seeds from last year, and mix them with green ash to prevent diseases and insect pests. (3) In order to seize the time to rush harvest the summer fields and rush plant the autumn crops, the team's full and semi-labor force has been specifically divided, striving to finish harvesting the wheat fields and sowing the autumn fields well within five days.

The 24 production mutual aid teams in Fengling Village, Guichi County, led by Luo Guangming, a well-known agricultural labor model in the Southern Anhui District, have successfully completed their spring production challenge plan. Since March 14th, when the 24 mutual aid teams responded to the challenge from the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team to launch a patriotic and high-yield competition, by the end of April, they had repaired 70 ponds and newly opened one pond, ensuring that more than 1,100 mu of high-lying fields in the village would not be affected by drought. In terms of spring plowing, the 24 teams plowed a total of 963.8 mu of spring land four to five times and harrowed it 11 times; in late April, due to continuous rain, 30 to 40 percent of the seedlings of each team rotted. In order not to delay rice transplanting, each team promptly re-sowed seedlings that could plant 527 mu of rice fields. Now, they are busily transplanting rice, and the rice seedlings for 780 mu of fields have already been transplanted. Each team also used the gaps between spring plowing to reclaim 33 mu of wasteland, all planted with buckwheat. In addition, they planted 720 tung trees, 260 tea trees, and afforested 98.4 mu of mountains, basically eliminating all the barren fields and wasteland in the village. In terms of sideline production, the 24 mutual aid teams raised a total of 206 pigs and 1,040 chickens, exceeding their challenge plan.

　　苏殿选罗光明等互助组
    向李顺达互助组应战后完成春季爱国增产计划
    河南省著名劳动模范苏殿选互助组，已完成春季爱国增产计划，并订出了夏季生产计划。因此，他们最近特写信向李顺达互助组暨全省劳动模范报告生产成绩。该信称：我们全组五十多亩小麦地都锄过两遍；全组今年共播种了三亩八分棉田，所有棉种都经过温水浸和青灰拌。八亩春烟地已犁过两遍、耙了一遍。在种烟时，由于我们采用了各种护苗方法，烟苗已全部出土，而且长得特别好。全组共积肥四百六十五车，添置耙、杈等农具四十九件，另外修理水井四眼，添置水车计四十个。在副业生产方面，全组合开粉坊一座，添置豆腐磨一盘，养猪十一口；全组组员又都参加了合作社。为着进一步合理使用半劳动力，我们最近根据每个组员的体力和特长，实行了科学分工，使互助组由单纯农业生产互助，提高到农、副业生产的互助。在生产竞赛中，我们积极向农民群众宣传与推广好的耕作技术和新式农具，两个月中，我们教会了本乡一百四十五个农民使用七英寸步犁。
    我们全组为迎接夏收、夏种，在春季生产的基础上，订出了夏季生产的计划：（一）除早秋地外，五十多亩麦茬地，计划种烟十亩，其余全部播种晚秋作物；（二）麦收时，保证在田间选出“短二芒”和“红蚰子”优良麦种各二千斤。播种玉米时，全部使用去年新选的“马牙玉米”良种，并用青灰拌，防治病虫害。（三）为抓紧时间抢收夏田和抢种秋季作物，全组整、半劳动力已具体分工，争取五天内把麦地收完，把秋田播种好。
    皖南区著名农业劳动模范罗光明所领导的贵池县枫岭村二十四个生产互助组，已胜利完成春季生产应战计划。该村二十四个互助组，自三月十四日响应李顺达互助组开展爱国丰产竞赛的挑战后，到四月底，已修复塘坝七十口，并新开水塘一口，保证了全村一千一百多亩高田不受干旱。在春耕方面，二十四个组共九百六十三亩八分春地，已普遍犁了四遍至五遍，耙了十一遍；四月下旬，因阴雨连绵，致使各组的秧苗腐烂了三、四成，为着不误插秧，各组又及时补播了可种五百二十七亩稻田的秧苗。现在，他们正在紧张地进行插秧，且有七百八十亩田的稻秧已经插完。各组还利用春耕间隙开荒地三十三亩，都种上了苦荞麦。此外，又种桐子树七百二十株，茶树二百六十株，封山育林九十八亩四分，基本上消灭了全村所有的荒田、荒地。在副业生产上，二十四个互助组共养猪二百零六口、养鸡一千零四十只，超额完成了应战计划。
