　　The Great Chinese People in the World Peace and Democracy Camp
    -- Written for the Labor Day Special Issue of "For Lasting Peace! For People's Democracy!"
      Peng Zhen
    For over a hundred years, the Chinese people, who had been ravaged, exploited, and humiliated by foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries, are now liberated and stand up to be masters of China.
    The whole world knows that since the day the Chinese people confronted imperialism, they have been engaged in fierce struggles with the imperialists. The purpose of this struggle was, in the past, to liberate themselves from the iron heel of imperialism; now it is to continue to oppose imperialist aggression, consolidate the fruits of their struggle, and defend world peace and democracy. The Chinese people, who have endured suffering and have been tempered in battle, know that the victory and consolidation of the Chinese people are inseparable from the sympathy and assistance of the working people and oppressed nations of the world, especially the great Soviet people. At the same time, every struggle and victory of the Chinese people, in turn, gives powerful support to the working people of the world and the Soviet Union. This shows that the working people of the world are one family, sharing weal and woe. For the Chinese people, patriotism and internationalism are not only able to be unified, but are completely consistent. The enemies overthrown by the Chinese people are not only domestic reactionaries, but also the sum total of all imperialists and their running dogs in China's reactionary forces. People know that the iron heels and claws of all imperialists have been inserted into China. These common enemies of the working people of the world have relied on China's feudal forces, comprador class, and all reactionary remnants and historical garbage to form a reactionary rule that oppressed the Chinese people, suppressed the Chinese revolutionary movement, and protected imperialist aggression—a reactionary rule that was inherited from the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the Northern Warlords to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. The combined forces of these domestic and foreign reactionary rulers used to be very powerful. Now, after more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, one following the other, especially after the Great October Revolution, the Chinese people have gone through the Great Revolution and Northern Expedition of 1924-1927, the Land Revolution Movement of 1928-1937, the Anti-Japanese War of 1937-1945, and the People's Liberation War from 1946 to the present, finally annihilating the more than eight million reactionary armed forces of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, which were directly armed and commanded by the United States, expelling all the troops of imperialism in China, especially the US imperialist troops stationed in China, overthrowing reactionary rule, and establishing their own people's regime. The victory of the Chinese people has given the world imperialist system a new devastating blow. It has further changed the balance of power between the two major camps in the world, namely the imperialist aggressive camp and the peace and democracy camp. It has terrified the imperialists and all other reactionaries in the world, and it has inspired the working people and all oppressed nations of the world. This is the first major event in world history since the Great October Revolution and the anti-fascist Second World War.
    In order to continue to complete and consolidate its victory, the Chinese people are now engaged in fierce struggles of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionary elements; and are carrying out the great people's democratic political power and economic construction. The great Communist Party of China, in order to meet the new and huge tasks after victory, is preparing to comprehensively and systematically rectify the Party's organization, and is developing and building the Party's organization in areas where land reform has recently been completed, especially among urban industrial workers, to further improve the quality and combat effectiveness of the vanguard of the Chinese working class. The Chinese people, who have always been slandered by the imperialist bandits as the "sick man of East Asia" and as dark and backward, have now stood up. In the newly emerging China, all reactionary garbage is being quickly swept away, and all people's democratic construction undertakings are developing rapidly. A new high tide of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and the cause of people's democratic construction are developing vigorously and enthusiastically.
  The New High Tide of the Chinese People Against Imperialism and Feudalism
    The struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend world peace and democracy has been universally launched throughout China; a large number of outstanding Chinese people's sons and daughters have formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and are bravely fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in the anti-US patriotic war. US imperialism is the enemy of the people of China and Korea, and it is also the greatest enemy of the working people of the world now and the last one in human history. The struggle waged by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army against the US invading army is a struggle to save Korea from danger and strive for the liberation of the Korean nation; it is a struggle for the Chinese people to defend their homes and defend their victorious achievements; and it is also a struggle for the Chinese people to most effectively stop imperialist aggression and defend world peace and democracy. It is fighting for the Korean people, for the Chinese people, and also for the people of the world. It is a movement of patriotism; it is also a movement of internationalism. It will write the most glorious page in human history.
    The current era is an era of the rising tide of the world's people's struggle against imperialism, an era in which imperialism is frantically carrying out aggression and the proletariat and oppressed nations are carrying out revolution. Armed struggle against imperialist aggressors is not only the main form of struggle in the Chinese people's revolution, but it has also begun to become the main form of struggle for the people of all oppressed countries such as Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaya. Imperialism and the oppressed people are irreconcilable. Imperialism and all reactionaries are armed from head to toe. As long as oppressed people or oppressed nations rise up to resist aggression and demand liberation, wanting to overthrow the rule of imperialism and reactionaries, they will immediately encounter armed suppression from these bandits there, becoming a bloody struggle. In these places, the masses of the people have no choice but to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces with revolutionary armed forces. Although these bandits sometimes disguise themselves as benevolent and deceive the people, when the people's strength and revolutionary struggle develop to the point of endangering their reactionary rule, they will immediately show their ferocious faces and use artillery fire to deal with the revolutionary people. The people must resolutely strike back at the imperialist jackals rushing towards them and resolutely wage a just armed struggle. In places where these armed struggles become the main form of struggle, all other forms of struggle cannot but revolve around and be auxiliary to armed struggle.
    The era of imperialism has long passed. Judging from its trend of decline and death, from its externally strong but internally weak nature, that is, from its essential aspect and overall aspect, imperialism is just a paper tiger. We should despise it and scorn it. Our strength is strong and growing, while the enemy's strength is weak and declining. The enemy can be defeated and overthrown. We must have such a high degree of confidence in victory. However, for every specific struggle, we must give sufficient assessment to the enemy's strength, mobilize all possible forces, and go all out in order to win the victory of the specific struggle time after time. According to the experience of the Chinese people's revolution led by the great Mao Zedong, to defeat the imperialist bandits, we must not only have the strong leadership of the vanguard of the working class, not only have the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, but also must establish a broad and powerful anti-imperialist united front under the leadership of the proletariat, based on the workers and peasants. Otherwise, we cannot smoothly defeat the enemy. The Chinese people have relied on this united front and adopted a form of struggle mainly based on armed forces to defeat the enemy. We believe that the Korean people will eventually defeat all the imperialist bandits who have invaded their country with the same organization and form of struggle.
    We must not only resist the aggression of US imperialism and eliminate the imperialist aggressor forces, but also thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces and influences of imperialism in China. Imperialists have carried out more than a hundred years of political, military, economic, and cultural aggression against China, spreading strong poisons and influences among some backward people in China. Especially in recent years, due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the idea of fear of the United States and pro-American and worship of the United States has been vigorously spread among the Chinese people. Some people who lack political common sense have been deeply poisoned by their anti-propaganda. Therefore, after victory, the Chinese people must make great efforts to clear away the remaining forces and influences of imperialism in China. In this movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, we are completing this historical task on a national scale and with twice the result with half the effort. After a short period of half a year, all the hidden forces and influences of imperialism, especially US imperialism, in China are being rapidly eradicated; especially the American compradors and other pro-American and worship of the United States elements who used to be arrogant and smug, have now become "beaten cats" that are hitting walls everywhere and cannot even lift their heads if their "slave nature has not changed."
    Now, the people of the whole of China are further developing and deepening the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the movement to oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan and oppose the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan. The broad masses of the Chinese people are holding meetings to discuss the Japan issue and holding public opinion polls and signature campaigns to support the conclusion of a peace treaty in accordance with the resolutions of the First World Peace Council. The struggle of 475 million Chinese people united as one against US aggression and defending world peace will soon make the imperialists deeply understand that this is a heavy blow to them. Let the war-mongers continue to deceive themselves and boast. Soon they will find that not only will their remaining hidden forces and influences in China be completely eradicated, but their invading army in Korea will also die without a burial place.
    Another aspect of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression, defending the fruits of victory, and defending peace and democracy is to continue to carry out land reform and completely eliminate the feudal system. In the past year, land reform has been completed in areas with another 130 million agricultural population, that is, about 80 million poor peasants have obtained about 10 million hectares of land from landlords. (Together with the old liberated areas, land reform has now been completed in areas with a total agricultural population of 270 million.) Next year, we will basically complete land reform nationwide, that is, completely complete the historical task of eliminating the feudal land system and eliminating the landlord class economically. At that time, the Chinese peasant class will be able to increase its income by 20 million to 25 million tons of grain each year simply by being exempt from paying rent to landlords. This is an extremely fierce and large-scale struggle. In the vast countryside, thousands of millions of peasants are overthrowing from bottom to top the reliance and helpers of the imperialists who oppress the Chinese people, overthrowing the main allies of the imperialists in China, namely the landlord class. The result of this measure has greatly strengthened and expanded the strength of the Chinese people, further shattered the imperialists' aggressive ambitions against China, and laid the foundation for China's industrialization and democratization.
    China is a large country. The vast newly liberated areas, which have not been liberated for long, not only have very few cadres, but also the peasant masses do not have sound organizations. In order to overthrow a feudal landlord class that has ruled for thousands of years and eliminate a feudal land system in such areas, it is by no means possible only with an order from the Central People's Government and the efforts of a few cadres. We must boldly and fully mobilize the broad masses of peasants and lead the peasants to overthrow the landlords by themselves from bottom to top, seize land and other property from the landlords, and distribute it themselves in accordance with the decrees of the Central People's Government. Only in this way can we completely eliminate feudal forces, complete land reform, fully unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasant masses, and thoroughly defeat all our enemies. The vanguard of the Chinese working class relied on this enthusiasm in the past to persist in the ten-year civil war and the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and finally eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and all the forces of the imperialist bandits in China. In the future, we will also rely on this enthusiasm to repel all imperialist aggression and build a great new China.
    The solid alliance between the Chinese working class and the Chinese peasants has a long history. In the Great Revolution era of 1924-1927, the Chinese working class united with the peasants and relied on this alliance to carry out the Northern Expedition. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang betrayed the revolution and caused the revolution to fail, the vanguard of the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the great Mao Zedong, transferred to the countryside, and after the land revolution and the war of resistance against Japan, relied on the peasants to create powerful revolutionary base areas, and finally liberated the cities and the Chinese mainland in the People's Liberation War. Because the vanguard of the Chinese working class led the peasants to overthrow the landlords, obtain land, win the victory of the war, and obtain complete liberation, it has established extremely high prestige among the peasant masses. This guarantees the permanent and solid alliance between the Chinese workers and peasants, guarantees that the Chinese peasants can always follow the Chinese Communist Party, which is highly armed with Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously move forward, and in the future take the road of agricultural collectivization towards socialism.
    Another important measure for the Chinese people to consolidate the fruits of victory and stop imperialist aggression is to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements nationwide, eliminate enemy spies, and eliminate all bandits, secret agents, bullies, and other counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people. These national scum and public enemies of the people are all instigated or supported by the American-Chiang bandits. Some of them have been directly trained by the American-Chiang cooperative special agent organs, the so-called "Sino-American Special Technology Cooperation Institute." After the American-Chiang reactionaries were defeated by the Chinese people on the mainland, they placed their hope on the harassment and sabotage activities of these special agent bandits. The Chinese people deeply understand that "the fortress is most easily breached from within." Therefore, after the People's Government called for resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the people of the whole country immediately rose up together to assist the government in suppressing various counter-revolutionary activities and eliminating various counter-revolutionary elements, so that the revolutionary order was rapidly further consolidated. Now, not only have more than one million bandits across the country been rapidly eliminated, but also counter-revolutionary elements scattered and hidden in various places are being rapidly eliminated.
    The work of eliminating the remnants of counter-revolution is a continuation of the struggle to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and imperialism, and it is a fierce struggle waged by the masses of the people against the enemy, not simply the anti-espionage and anti-sabotage work of the People's Public Security Organs. Therefore, we are cooperating closely with various democratic parties to mobilize people from all walks of life in a planned, prepared, and step-by-step manner from bottom to top to assist the government in carrying it out. Under the current circumstances in China, without the coordination of the mass anti-reactionary movement of the broad masses of the people and the People's Public Security Organs, it would not be possible to quickly complete the work of thoroughly eliminating the remnants of counter-revolution. Current experience has proven that as long as the broad masses of the people are truly mobilized, all counter-revolutionary elements will be completely isolated and have nowhere to hide, and thus will be quickly eliminated.
    The results of these great struggles will further develop and consolidate the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and further strengthen the strength of the world peace and democracy camp.
  The Construction Undertakings of the Chinese People are Developing Rapidly
    The construction of the Chinese people's democratic political power is being universally carried out in cities and villages. The Chinese people's democratic political power is a political power based on the system of people's representative conferences. The people's representative conference is the basic organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front, and it is also the basic form by which the Chinese people manage state affairs. It is through this form that we have consolidated all revolutionary people into a huge force to continue to develop and consolidate the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Today, China's political power is a new democratic political power, not yet a political power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Because it is a revolutionary alliance of the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic people, it is neither a representative system, nor is it yet a soviet system, but a system of people's representative conferences. Experience has proven that this is the best form of government for China at this stage. Now, 24 provinces, 90 cities, and 1,967 counties in China have convened people's representative conferences. The Chinese people, who have long been trampled under the iron heels of imperialism and feudalism, have now become the masters of their own country.
    People's democracy is the source of all strength and the basic condition for the masses of the people to fully unleash their enthusiasm and creativity. The liberated Chinese people not only love their motherland and are engaged in a heroic struggle against US imperialism to defend their motherland, defend their democratic rights and happy life, and defend world peace and democracy, but also are making great efforts to carry out great national defense and economic construction undertakings to develop and consolidate their victory, and are struggling to improve the country's economic status and the people's economic life.
    The purpose of our Chinese people in overthrowing imperialism and feudalism is to transform a enslaved, poor, backward agricultural country into an independent, democratic, happy, and prosperous industrial country. After our victory, we first strive to restore production, stabilize finance, prices, balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, and adjust public-private and labor-capital relations. Thanks to the efforts of the central and local people's governments and the people of the whole country, since March of last year, we have overcome the chaotic financial and economic situation created by the past reactionary rulers, curbed inflation, stabilized prices, strived to balance the country's fiscal revenue and expenditure, and enabled production to achieve rapid recovery and development.
    The industrial construction of the new China is led by a strong state-owned economy and cooperative economy. Because banks, mines, steel, electricity, railway transportation, and many other important enterprises are mainly operated by the state, the state of anarchy in production and the market is gradually decreasing, and the planning of industrial production is gradually being strengthened. From the trend of development, private enterprises are now developing rapidly like public enterprises, but the development speed and scale of public enterprises are far greater than those of private enterprises, so the proportion and leading role of public enterprises in the entire economic system are also constantly increasing. The Chinese people are brave, intelligent, and hardworking. The liberated Chinese working class is giving play to its great enthusiasm and creativity, carrying out production competitions and new record movements. Especially in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, patriotic production competition movements have been universally launched in all production sectors across the country. The production volume of some sectors has exceeded the pre-war level.
    Because Chinese peasants have been freed from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism and have become their own masters, their productivity and production enthusiasm have also increased rapidly. Agriculture, which was severely damaged by the reactionary rule of the American-Chiang regime, has been rapidly restored. In 1950, the national agricultural production volume reached more than 80% of the highest production volume before the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1936. Some old liberated areas have exceeded the pre-war level. With the increase in agricultural productivity, the purchasing power of peasants has also increased rapidly. The liberated peasants are not only able to supply industry with a large amount of raw materials and food, but also require urban industry to supply them with a large amount of daily necessities.
    Due to national unity, rapid recovery of industrial and agricultural production and railway transportation, and the elimination of various feudal obstacles, the urban economy and the rural economy have begun to prosper. The exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has been carried out on an unprecedented scale and speed, and foreign trade has also turned from a startling trade deficit of many years to a trade surplus.
    There are still many serious difficulties and shortcomings on our road of economic construction, but because we have the cooperation and mutual assistance of the great Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, because we have created a series of financial and economic policies suitable for China's specific conditions under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, and have formulated a common program that is unanimously supported by all revolutionary classes and democratic parties in China, various social economic components such as our state-owned economy, cooperative economy, individual economy of peasants and handicraftsmen, and private capitalist economy can develop healthily under the unified leadership of the state-owned economy and gradually achieve a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation. Current experience has proven that in a country like China, the new democratic economic system is a superior system. It can not only enable production to be rapidly restored and developed and the economy to gradually move towards prosperity, but also will enable the entire economy to steadily move towards the socialist future.
  The Development and Consolidation of the Communist Party of China is a Guarantee for the Victorious Development of the Chinese People
    The reason why the Chinese people have been able to achieve today's victory is because they have the leadership of the great and glorious Communist Party of China headed by Mao Zedong. The Communist Party of China now has 5.8 million members. This is an unprecedented vanguard of the working class in Chinese history. It is a party built thoroughly on the solid theoretical basis of Marxism-Leninism, a Bolshevik-style party. However, because it is located in China, a large country with a backward economy and a large number of petty bourgeoisie, in order to maintain its purity in politics, ideology, and organization, and to continuously maintain and improve its political quality and combat effectiveness, it is necessary to constantly rectify the Party's work style and organization in accordance with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Party Constitution of the Communist Party of China. We have carried out such work many times in the past. At present, under the circumstances of the national victory and the great development of the Party's organization, in order to strengthen the Party's leading role in future revolutionary struggles and national construction, and in order to maintain and improve the Party's purity in organization, politics, and ideology, we are preparing to carry out a comprehensive Party rectification work again, seriously, cautiously, in a planned, prepared, and led manner, to systematically reorganize the Party's organization once again, to universally educate all Party members on how to be a Communist Party member, and to strengthen the leadership of the branches, improve the organizational life of the branches, so that all Party members understand the standards of being a Communist Party member, and use the ideological level of communism to measure themselves. To enable all outstanding Party members to continue to improve themselves and give greater play to their enthusiasm and creativity; to enable all Party members with problems or shortcomings to quickly raise their awareness and correct their mistakes and shortcomings; and to cleanse those backward elements who cannot be transformed and the small number of bad elements who have infiltrated the Party. Past experience has proven that every time our Party undergoes a rectification, its quality and combat effectiveness are greatly improved.
    In the work of developing the Party's organization, in view of the current uneven distribution of the Party's organization and members, and we are in a situation where the Chinese revolution has won a basic victory, therefore, on the one hand, the Party's grassroots organizations in the old areas and some new areas must temporarily stop development and be rectified; on the other hand, in the new rural areas and factories, mines, enterprises, organs, and higher vocational schools where land reform has been completed, the Party's organization must be developed prudently, in a led, and planned manner under strict management. At present, the focus is first on recruiting new Party members from industrial workers and establishing Party organizations. For all activists who want to join the Party or are willing to receive Party education, we first conduct a systematic education on how to be a Communist Party member, that is, education on the Communist Party and communism, so that they truly understand that the Communist Party of China is the party of the Chinese working class, is the advanced organized force of the working class, it not only wants to fight for the consolidation of the victory of China's new democracy, but also wants to fight for the final realization of the communist system in China, every Party member must serve the people wholeheartedly, unconditionally work for the Party and the people, and fight for the cause of the Party and the people, and strictly abide by the Party's discipline, and play an exemplary role in all struggles and undertakings led by the Party, every Party member must constantly and diligently study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly use the method of criticism and self-criticism to improve their awareness, improve their work ability, and improve their work. Then, after careful selection and systematic investigation, those who are active in the struggle, work, or production, study, have good components, high awareness, and a clear political outlook, and who truly meet the conditions of a Communist Party member, will be recruited into the Party.
    For the Communist Party of China after victory, this work is not only completely possible, but also absolutely necessary.
    The Chinese people are great and invincible. The greatness of the modern Chinese people is first because they have followed the path of the Soviets under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China headed by Mao Zedong, and have therefore achieved great achievements. Today's world is already an era where all roads lead to communism. Facts have fully proven that the road of the Soviets led by the great Lenin and Stalin is the common road of the working people of the world, and the road that the Chinese people have already taken and are taking in the past and present is also the road that the people of all colonial and semi-colonial countries should take.
    The great victory achieved by the Chinese people is the victory of the working people of the world, and it has greatly strengthened the strength of the world peace and democracy camp.
    Today, the strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is incomparably greater than at any time in the past. During the Second World War, the Soviet army eliminated more than 12 million German-Japanese fascists and their vassal state troops, and as its main force, it destroyed three imperialist countries for mankind; after a long period of heroic struggle, the Chinese people and their great People's Liberation Army finally eliminated the more than 8 million reactionary troops of Chiang Kai-shek armed by US imperialism and established the great People's Republic of China. China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries not only represent human justice, but the two countries alone have more than one-third of the world's population. And it has been consolidated and united by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The strength of the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union and with China and the Soviet Union as its backbone, has now not only greatly exceeded and overwhelmed the enemy, but is also developing and growing by leaps and bounds. This force is sufficient to defend peace and is also sufficient to defeat any imperialist aggression.
    The people's democratic countries of the world, the working people of the world, unite with the great socialist Soviet Union as the head, and fight to stop imperialist aggression and defend world peace and democracy! The current era belongs to us. Final victory is beckoning to us.

　　世界和平民主阵营中的伟大的中国人民
    ——为《争取持久和平！争取人民民主！》劳动节专号作
      彭真
    百余年来，一直受着外国帝国主义和国内反动派蹂躏、压榨、侮辱的中国人民，现在解放了，站起来做了中国的主人了。
    全世界都知道：中国人民自从与帝国主义交手的那天起，就始终与帝国主义者进行着剧烈的斗争。这种斗争的目的，过去是为了从帝国主义的铁蹄下解放自己；现在是为了继续反对帝国主义的侵略、巩固自己斗争的胜利果实和保卫世界和平与民主。饱经忧患和久经战斗锻炼的中国人民知道：中国人民的胜利之取得与巩固，是与全世界的劳动人民和被压迫民族，特别是伟大的苏联人民的同情与援助不可分的。同时，中国人民的每一个斗争和胜利，又反过来给予全世界劳动人民和苏联以有力的支持。这说明了休戚相关、患难与共的全世界劳动人民是一家。对于中国人民来说，爱国主义与国际主义不但是能够统一，而且是完全一致的。中国人民所打倒的敌人，不仅仅是国内反动派，而且是一切帝国主义者及其走狗在中国反动力量的总和。人们知道，所有帝国主义者的铁蹄与魔爪都曾经插入了中国，这些全世界劳动人民的共同敌人，曾经依靠中国的封建势力、买办阶级及一切反动余孽和历史垃圾，组成了压迫中国人民、镇压中国革命运动、保护帝国主义侵略的反动统治——从满清、北洋军阀到蒋介石国民党一脉相传的反动统治。这种国内外反动统治者的联合力量，曾经是很强大的。现在，中国人民经过百余年来前仆后继的英勇斗争，特别是在伟大的十月革命后，经过一九二四——一九二七年的大革命北伐运动、一九二八——一九三七年的土地革命运动、一九三七——一九四五年的抗日战争、一九四六年至现在的人民解放战争，最后终于消灭了直接由美国所武装、由美国所指挥的蒋介石国民党八百余万反动武装，驱逐了帝国主义在中国的一切军队，特别是美国帝国主义在中国的驻军，打倒了反动统治，建立了人民自己的政权。中国人民的胜利，给了世界帝国主义体系以新的毁灭性打击，它进一步改变了世界两大营垒，即帝国主义侵略营垒与和平民主营垒的力量对比。它使全世界的帝国主义者及其他一切反动派胆战心惊，它使全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫民族欢欣鼓舞。这是伟大的十月革命和反法西斯的二次世界大战以后世界历史上第一件大事。
    为了继续完成与巩固自己的胜利，中国人民现在正进行着抗美援朝、土地改革与镇压反革命分子的激烈斗争；正在进行着伟大的人民民主政权和经济建设。伟大的中国共产党为了迎接胜利后的新的巨大任务，正在准备全面地系统地整顿党的组织，并在新近已经完成土地改革的地区，特别是城市产业工人中，发展与建设党的组织，进一步提高中国工人阶级先锋队的质量和战斗力。一向被帝国主义的强盗们诬蔑为“东亚病夫”、诬蔑为黑暗落后的中国人民，现在站起来了，在新兴的中国，一切反动的垃圾在迅速地被扫除着，一切人民民主建设事业，在迅速地发展着，新的反帝反封建的高潮和人民民主建设事业，正在轰轰烈烈、如火如荼地发展着。
  中国人民反帝反封建的新高潮
    反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平民主的抗美援朝斗争，已经在全中国普遍地展开了；大批优秀的中国人民子弟，已经组成了中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军在一起，英勇地并肩进行着抗美爱国战争。美国帝国主义是中朝两国人民的敌人，也是全世界劳动人民现在最大的和人类历史上最后的一个敌人。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军对于美国侵略军所进行的斗争，是挽救朝鲜危亡、争取朝鲜民族解放的斗争；是中国人民自己保家卫国、保卫胜利果实的斗争；也是中国人民最有效地制止帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平民主的斗争。是为朝鲜人民而战，为中国人民而战，也是为全世界人民而战。是爱国主义的运动；也是国际主义的运动。它将在人类历史上写下最光辉的一页。
    现在的时代，是世界人民反对帝国主义斗争高涨的时代，是帝国主义疯狂地实行侵略和无产阶级与被压迫民族实行革命的时代。向帝国主义侵略者实行武装斗争，不仅是中国人民革命的主要斗争形式，而且它已开始成为朝鲜、越南、菲律宾、马来亚等所有被压迫国家人民的主要斗争形式了。帝国主义与被压迫人民是势不两立的。帝国主义和一切反动派，是从手脚一直武装到牙齿的，只要被压迫人民或被压迫民族在那里起来反抗侵略，要求解放，要打倒帝国主义和反动派的统治，立刻就会在那里遭到这些强盗们的武装镇压，成为流血的斗争。在这些地方，人民群众就不得不以革命的武装，反对反革命的武装。这些强盗们虽然有时也伪装慈悲，欺骗人民，但是当人民力量和革命斗争发展到足以危害他们的反动统治的时候，他们立刻就会露出狰狞的面目，用炮火来对付革命的人民。人民对于迎面扑来的帝国主义豺狼，只有坚决予以迎头痛击，坚决地进行正义的武装斗争。在这些武装斗争成为主要斗争形式的地方，其他一切斗争的形式，就不能不围绕着武装斗争，并且为着武装斗争，而成为辅助的斗争形式。
    帝国主义的时代，是早已过去了。从其日就没落与日就死亡的趋势来讲，从其外强中干的实质来讲，即从其本质的方面和总的方面来讲，帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎，我们应该藐视它、鄙视它。我们的力量是强大的，日益壮大的，敌人的力量是弱小的，日益衰弱的。敌人是可以战胜、可以打倒的。我们必须有这样的高度的胜利信心。但是对于每一个具体斗争场合来讲，我们却必须对于敌人的力量，予以足够的估计，动员一切可能的力量，全力以赴，以便一次一次地去取得具体斗争的胜利。根据伟大的毛泽东所领导的中国人民革命的经验，我们要战胜帝国主义强盗，不但要有工人阶级先锋队的坚强领导，不但要有工农联盟作基础，而且必须在无产阶级领导下，以工农为基础，建立包括全体人民的广泛而强大的反帝统一战线。否则我们就不能顺利地战胜敌人。中国人民已经依靠这种统一战线，采用以武装为主的斗争形式，战胜了敌人。我们相信，朝鲜人民，最后也将以同样的组织和斗争形式，战胜侵入国土的一切帝国主义强盗。
    我们不但要反抗美国帝国主义的侵略，消灭帝国主义的侵略军、而且必须彻底肃清帝国主义在中国的残余势力和影响。帝国主义者曾经对中国进行了百余年的政治、军事、经济和文化侵略，在中国一部分落后人民中，曾经散布了浓厚的毒素和影响。特别是近些年来，由于蒋介石匪帮，在中国人民中曾经极力散布恐美病和亲美、崇美思想，有些缺乏政治常识的人，曾经深深地中了他们反宣传的毒素。因此中国人民在胜利之后，就必须以极大的努力来扫清帝国主义在中国残存的势力和影响。在这次抗美援朝运动中，我们正以普及全国的规模和事半功倍的速度，完成着这一历史的任务。经过短短半年的期间，一切帝国主义特别是美国帝国主义在中国的潜伏势力和影响，迅速地被铲除着；特别是曾经趾高气扬、神气十足的美国买办和其他亲美、崇美分子，凡是“奴性不改”的，现在已经变成了到处碰壁的“挨打猫”，连头都抬不起来了。
    现在全中国的人民，正在进一步开展和深入抗美援朝运动以及反对美国重新武装日本、反对美国单独对日媾和的运动。中国广大人民正在根据第一届世界和大理事会的决议，开会讨论日本问题，并举行民意投票及拥护缔结和平公约的签名运动。四亿七千五百万中国人这样万众一心反对美国侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争，不久就会使帝国主义者深刻地领会到这对他们是一种沉重的打击。让战争贩子们继续自欺欺人地吹牛吧，不久他们就将发现：不但他们在中国的残余潜伏势力和影响将彻底被肃清，他们在朝鲜的侵略军，也将死无葬身之地。
    中国人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫胜利果实、保卫和平民主的斗争的另一面，是继续进行土地改革、彻底消灭封建制度。在过去一年内，中国又有一亿三千万农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，即约有八千万贫苦农民从地主手中取得约一千万公顷的土地。（连同老解放区，现在全国已有二亿七千万农业人口的地区，完成了土地改革。）明年我们将在全国范围内基本上完成土地改革，即彻底完成消灭封建的土地制度和从经济上消灭地主阶级的历史任务。那时中国农民阶级仅仅因为免向地主缴纳地租，每年即可增加二千万至二千五百万吨粮食的收入。这是一个极端剧烈的和规模宏大的斗争。在广大的乡村中，千千万万的农民正自下而上地打倒帝国主义者压迫中国人民的依靠和助手，打倒帝国主义者在中国的主要同盟军，即地主阶级。这一措施的结果，大大加强与壮大了中国人民的力量，进一步粉碎帝国主义对中国的侵略野心与奠定中国工业化和民主化的基础。
    中国是一个大国，解放不久的广大的新解放区，不仅干部很少，并且农民群众还没有健全的组织，要在这样的地区里，打倒一个统治几千年的封建地主阶级，消灭一个封建的土地制度，决不仅仅是中央人民政府的一纸命令和少数干部的努力所能完成。我们必须放手地、充分地发动广大农民群众，领导农民由他们自己动手，自下而上地打倒地主，从地主手里夺取土地及其他财产，并自己动手按照中央人民政府的法令，加以分配。只有这样，才能彻底消灭封建势力，完成土地改革，才能充分发挥农民群众的革命积极性，并且彻底打倒我们的一切敌人。中国工人阶级的先锋队，过去，就是依靠这种积极性，坚持了十年内战和八年抗日战争，并且最后消灭了蒋介石匪帮和帝国主义强盗们在中国的一切势力，今后我们也将依靠这种积极性打退一切帝国主义的侵略，建设伟大的新中国。
    中国工人阶级和中国农民的巩固联盟，是有悠久的历史的。在一九二四——一九二七年的大革命时代，中国工人阶级就联合了农民，并且依靠这种联合进行了北伐战争。在蒋介石匪帮叛变革命，使革命失败之后，中国工人阶级的先锋队在伟大的毛泽东领导下，转移到乡村，经过土地革命和抗日战争，依靠农民创造了强大的革命根据地，最后又在人民解放战争中解放了城市，解放了中国大陆。因为中国工人阶级的先锋队领导农民打倒了地主，取得了土地，赢得了战争的胜利，获得了彻底的解放，它已经在农民群众中建立了极高的威信。这就保证了中国工农永久而巩固的联盟，保证了中国农民能够永远跟着以马克思、列宁主义、毛泽东思想所高度武装着的中国共产党不断前进，并在将来经过农业集体化的道路走向社会主义。
    当前中国人民巩固胜利果实和制止帝国主义侵略的另一重要措施，是在全国范围内坚决镇压反革命分子，肃清敌人间谍，肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子。这些民族败类、人民公敌，都是美蒋匪徒所策动或支持的，其中有些是直接受过美蒋合作的特务机关，即所谓“中美特种技术合作所”训练的。美蒋反动派在大陆上被中国人民打败之后，即把他们的一线希望寄托在这些特务土匪的骚扰破坏活动上面。中国人民深深地懂得“堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的”。因此，在人民政府号召坚决镇压反革命之后，全国人民立即一致奋起，协助政府镇压各种反革命活动，肃清各种反革命分子，使革命秩序迅速地获得了进一步的巩固。现在，不独是全国一百多万土匪已被迅速肃清，就是分散隐藏在各地的反革命分子也正被迅速地消灭。
    肃清反革命残余的工作，是打倒蒋介石反动派和帝国主义的斗争的继续，是人民群众对敌人进行的一种剧烈斗争，并不是单纯的人民公安机关的反奸防谍工作。因此，我们是由各民主党派密切合作，有领导、有准备、有步骤地动员各阶层人民，四面八方，自下而上地协助政府来进行。在中国当前的情况下，如果没有广大人民群众的肃反运动与人民公安机关相配合，彻底肃清反革命残余的工作，是不可能迅速完成的。现在的经验，已经证明，只要广大的人民群众真正发动起来，一切反革命分子就完全陷于孤立，无处藏身，因而迅速地被消灭。
    上述这些伟大斗争进行的结果，将使中国人民革命的胜利获得进一步地发展与巩固，并使世界和平民主阵营的力量进一步地增强。
  中国人民的建设事业在迅速地发展着
    中国人民的民主政权建设，正在城市与乡村普遍地开展着。中国人民民主政权，是人民代表会议制的政权，人民代表会议，是中国人民民主统一战线的基本组织形式，也是现在中国人民管理国家事务的基本形式，就是通过这种形式，我们才把全体革命的人民巩固地团结了起来，成为继续发展与巩固中国人民革命胜利的巨大力量。今天中国的政权是新民主主义的政权，还不是无产阶级专政的政权。因为它是工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主人士的革命联盟，所以它既不是代议制，也还不是苏维埃制，而是人民代表会议制。经验证明，这是中国现阶段最好的政权形式。现在中国已有二十四个省、九十个市、一千九百六十七个县召开了人民代表会议。长期被帝国主义、封建主义践踏在铁蹄下的中国人民，现在已经做了自己国家的主人。
    人民民主是一切力量的源泉，是人民群众充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性的基本条件。解放了的中国人民，不但热爱自己的祖国，为着保卫祖国，保卫自己的民主权利和幸福生活，保卫世界的和平与民主，进行着英勇的反对美国帝国主义的斗争，而且为了发展与巩固自己的胜利，正以高度的努力，进行着伟大的国防与经济建设事业，为改善国家的经济地位和人民的经济生活而斗争。
    我们中国人民打倒帝国主义，打倒封建主义的目的，是为了把一个被奴役的、贫穷落后的农业国，变成一个独立、民主、幸福和富强的工业国。我们在胜利之后，首先是努力恢复生产，稳定金融、物价，平衡财政收支和调整公私、劳资关系。由于中央和各级人民政府及全国人民的努力，自去年三月以来，我们已经克服了过去反动统治者所造成的财政经济的混乱情况，制止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价，争取了国家财政收支的平衡，并使生产获得迅速的恢复与发展。
    新中国的工业建设，因为有强大的国营经济和合作社经济的领导，因为银行、矿山、钢铁、电力、铁路交通和其他许多重要企业，主要是由国家经营，生产和市场的无政府状态已经在逐渐减少，工业生产的计划性已在逐渐加强。从发展的趋势来讲，现在私营企业也和公营企业一样，在迅速地发展着，但公营企业的发展速度和规模，却远远大过于私人企业，因而公营企业在整个经济体系中的比重和领导作用，也在不断地增强着。中国人民是勇敢、聪明、勤劳的，解放了的中国工人阶级，正在发挥其伟大的积极性和创造力，开展生产竞赛和新纪录运动，特别是在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，爱国主义的生产竞赛运动已经在全国一切生产部门中普遍地展开。有些部门的生产量，已经超过了战前的水平。
    中国农民因为摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的束缚，翻身做了主人，他们的生产力和生产积极性也迅速地提高了。被美蒋反动统治所严重破坏了的农业，已在迅速地恢复，一九五○年全国的农业生产量，已经达到了一九三六年抗日战争开始前最高产量的百分之八十以上，有些老的解放区，已经超过了战前的水平，随着农业生产力的提高，农民的购买力也迅速地增大了，解放了的农民，不但能够供给工业以大量的原料和食粮，而且要求城市工业能供给他们以大量的生活必需品。
    由于全国的统一，工业、农业生产和铁路交通的迅速地恢复及各种封建障碍的铲除，城市经济和乡村经济已开始走向繁荣，城市和乡村的物资交流已经以空前巨大的规模和速度开展起来，对外贸易也由多年来的惊人的入超转为出超。
    在我们经济建设的道路上，现在还有许多严重的困难和缺点，但因为我们有了伟大的苏联和人民民主国家的合作与互助，因为我们已在伟大的毛泽东主席的领导下，创造了一系列的适合中国具体情况的财政经济政策，并制定了为中国各个革命阶级和各民主党派所全体一致拥护的共同纲领。我们的国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济及私人资本主义经济等各种社会经济成份，是能够在国营经济的统一领导之下健全发展，并逐渐达到财政经济状况的根本好转的。现在的经验证明：在中国这样的国家中，新民主主义的经济制度是一种优越的制度，它不但可以使生产迅速获得恢复与发展，使经济逐渐走向繁荣，并且将使整个经济稳步地向着社会主义的前途迈进。
  中国共产党的发展与巩固是中国人民的胜利发展的保证
    中国人民所以能够取得今天的胜利，是由于有伟大的光荣的以毛泽东为首的中国共产党的领导。现在中国共产党已有五百八十万党员。这是中国历史上空前未有的工人阶级的先锋队。它是彻头彻尾地建筑在马克思列宁主义的巩固理论基础上的党，是布尔什维克式的党。但是，由于它是处在中国这样一个经济落后、小资产阶级数量众多的大国之中，对于这样一个群众性的党，要保持它在政治上、思想上和组织上的纯洁，不断保持与提高它的政治质量和战斗力，就必须经常按照马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，按照中国共产党的党纲党章，来进行整顿党的作风和党的组织的工作。过去我们已经多次进行了这样的工作，目前在全国胜利和党的组织有了很大发展的情况下，为了加强党在今后革命斗争和国家建设中的领导作用，为了保持并提高党在组织上、政治上和思想上的纯洁性，我们正准备再一次地进行全面的整党工作，认真地、谨慎地、有计划、有准备、有领导地对于党的组织再一次进行系统的整理，对所有党员普遍进行关于怎样做一个共产党员的教育，并加强对支部的领导，健全支部的组织生活，使所有的党员都明白做一个共产党员的标准，并以共产主义的思想水平来衡量自己。使所有优秀的党员，继续提高自己，并更加发挥其积极性和创造性；使所有有毛病或缺点的党员，迅速提高觉悟，改正其错误和缺点；对于不堪改造的落后分子和少数混入党内的坏分子，则加以清洗。过去的经验证明，我们的党每经过一次整顿，它的质量和战斗力就大大提高一步。
    在发展党的组织的工作上，鉴于目前党的组织和党员分布很不平衡，我们又是处在中国革命已经获得基本胜利的形势下，因此，一方面老区和某些新区党的基层组织，必须暂时停止发展，加以整顿；另一方面，在已经完成了土地改革的新区农村和工厂、矿区、企业、机关和专科以上学校中，党的组织又必须在严格管理下，审慎地、有领导、有计划地发展。目前首先是着重在产业工人中吸收新党员与建立党的组织。对于一切要求入党或愿意接受党的教育的积极分子，我们首先是对他们进行怎样做一个共产党员的系统的教育，即关于共产党和共产主义的教育，使他们真正了解中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，是工人阶级先进的有组织的部队，它不仅要为巩固中国新民主主义的胜利而奋斗，并且要为最后在中国实现共产主义制度而奋斗，每个党员必须全心全意为人民服务，无条件地为党和人民工作，为党和人民的事业而斗争，并且严格遵守党的纪律，在党所领导的一切斗争和事业中起模范作用，每个党员必须经常地努力地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，经常地运用批评与自我批评的方法，提高自己的觉悟，提高自己的工作能力，改进自己的工作。然后再经过审慎地选择与系统地考察，将其中在斗争、工作或生产、学习中积极的、成份好、觉悟高、政治面貌清楚的，确实合乎共产党员条件的吸收入党。
    对于胜利后的中国共产党，这个工作，不但是完全可能的，而且是绝对必需的。
    中国人民是伟大而不可战胜的。现代中国人民的伟大，首先是因为他们在伟大的以毛泽东为首的中国共产党的领导下，走了苏联人的道路，并因此得到了巨大的成就。今天的世界已经是条条道路都通向共产主义的时代了。事实已经充分证明：伟大的列宁、斯大林所领导的苏联人的道路，乃是全世界劳动人民共同的道路，过去和现在中国人民所已经走过的和正在走着的道路，也是一切殖民地半殖民地国家的人民所应该走的道路。
    中国人民所取得的伟大的胜利，乃是全世界劳动人民的胜利，它已大大地加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量。
    今天以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量，与过去任何时期的情况相比，都已经大得不可比拟了。苏联军队在第二次世界大战中曾消灭了德日法西斯及其附庸国军队一千二百多万，并且以它为主力为人类摧毁了三个帝国主义国家；中国人民和他的伟大的解放军在经过了长期英勇斗争之后，最后已消灭了由美国帝国主义所武装的蒋介石八百多万反动军队并建立起伟大的中华人民共和国。中苏两国及其他人民民主国家不仅代表着人类的正义，而且仅仅中苏两国就拥有世界上三分之一以上的人口。并且已经用中苏友好同盟互助条约巩固地团结起来，以苏联为首，以中苏两国为骨干的世界和平民主阵营的力量，现在不仅已经大大地超过与压倒了敌人，而且在飞跃地发展壮大着。这个力量足以捍卫和平，也足以战胜任何帝国主义的侵略。
    全世界的人民民主国家，全世界的劳动人民，以伟大的社会主义的苏联为首，团结起来，为制止帝国主义的侵略，为保卫世界和平民主而斗争罢！现在的时代是属于我们的。最后的胜利已在向我们招手。
