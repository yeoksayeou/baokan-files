Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 27th: The heroic Korean workers are not only skilled at peaceful construction but also excellent soldiers in the Fatherland Liberation War. They are valiantly fighting to defend the fruits of their hard labor.

Last June, when the workers in the northern half of Korea had completed the two one-year economic plans of 1947 and 1948 and were advancing towards the victorious completion of the two-year economic plan of 1949-1950, American imperialism, instigated by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, launched a sudden invasion. After the outbreak of the war, the workers immediately responded to General Kim Il-sung's call to battle and quickly converted peaceful industry into a wartime system. Young workers flocked to the front lines. In the first ten days after the start of the war, 25,000 young workers from the No. 75 Factory alone signed up for the army. The workers who remained in the rear actively launched a wartime production increase movement and donated their wages to the state to purchase weapons. According to statistics, 260,000 workers from 624 factories and enterprises in Korea enthusiastically donated to the weapons fund.

In the newly liberated areas of southern Korea, the workers also bravely participated in the great Fatherland Liberation War. Within ten days after the liberation of Seoul, 55 percent of the city's industrial workers had joined the volunteer army. The Ongjin Iron Mine in Hwanghae Province had consistently failed to start production under the rule of the American and Rhee bandit gangs. After the People's Army liberated Ongjin, production was restored in just a month and a half thanks to the efforts of the workers.

When the American and Rhee bandit armies frantically advanced northwards and the Korean people's liberation war entered its most arduous stage, the Korean working class continued to fight the enemy with unparalleled confidence in victory. Some workers moved factories and machines to the northern mountains to continue production. Other workers took up arms to launch guerrilla warfare or persisted in underground activities behind enemy lines. Almost all of the railway workers in the Seoul area participated in the defense of Seoul. The workers of the Kogon Coal Mine and the Kaeun Lead Mine in Kangwon Province all organized guerrilla units. The guerrilla unit organized by the workers of the Wonsan Shipyard fought the enemy more than fifty times, annihilating more than 800 enemy soldiers and seizing many guns and ammunition.

Kwon Yong-soo, a sixteen-year-old young worker at the Pyongyang No. 2 Sock Factory, did underground work in a concentration camp in East Pyongyang, rescuing more than 150 patriots who were imprisoned in the concentration camp. He himself was subjected to brutal torture by the enemy, but he remained steadfast. Lee Min-cheol, a driver at the railway locomotive depot in Kilju County, North Hamgyong Province, was arrested by the enemy because he did not have time to retreat. The enemy forced him to drive a military train. Lee Min-cheol, harboring a deep hatred for the American and Rhee bandit gangs, cleverly overturned all the vehicles except the locomotive when driving the train to the iron bridge between Yonghyeon Village and Bak'eul Village in Gyeongseong County, and escaped to the mountains to fight as a guerrilla.

After the Korean and Chinese People's Armies launched a powerful counteroffensive and quickly liberated vast areas, the Korean railway workers put forward the battle cry: "Wherever the army fights, the railway will be repaired!" Together with the Chinese volunteer aid-Korea railway workers, they repaired the railways side by side, regardless of the severe cold of winter and the enemy's frantic bombing and strafing, under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions. In the two months of January and February this year, the workers repaired a total of 364 enemy-damaged railways, bridges, and water supply stations.

Workers in other departments have similarly displayed a spirit of dedication, fully restoring factories and launching production increase struggles. Thanks to the efforts of the Korean working class, the restoration of factories and enterprises in various places is proceeding rapidly. Taking Pyongyang as an example, the electricity and tap water in Pyongyang City, which had been destroyed by the enemy, were restored less than twenty days after the liberation of Pyongyang.

The Korean workers know that there are still long and arduous battles ahead, and they are full of confidence and ready to overcome all difficulties and advance towards victory.

　　朝鲜工人的英勇斗争
    踊跃参军并全力展开增产竞赛
    【新华社平壤四月二十七日电】英雄的朝鲜工人不仅是和平建设的能手，而且也是祖国解放战争中优秀的战士。他们正在为保卫他们辛勤劳动得来的果实而英勇战斗着。
    去年六月，当朝鲜北半部的工人已完成了一九四七、一九四八年的两个一年经济计划，并正向着胜利完成一九四九——一九五○年二年经济计划的道路迈进时，美帝国主义指使李承晚匪帮，发动了突然的侵略。战争爆发后，工人们立即响应金日成将军的战斗号召，迅速地把和平工业转入战时体制。青年工人们纷纷走向前线。在战争开始后的头十天中，仅第七十五号工厂，就有二万五千个青年工人报名参军。留在后方的工人积极展开战时增产运动，把工资捐献给国家购买武器，据统计，朝鲜六百二十四个工厂、企业中的二十六万工人都踊跃捐献了武器基金。
    在朝鲜南半部新解放区，工人们同样奋勇地参加伟大的祖国解放战争。在汉城解放后的十天内，全市百分之五十五的产业工人都参加了义勇军。黄海道瓮津铁矿在美、李匪帮统治期中始终未能开工。人民军解放瓮津后，在工人们的努力下，仅仅一个半月，就恢复了生产。
    当美、李匪军疯狂地向北进犯，朝鲜人民的解放战争进入最艰苦的阶段时，朝鲜工人阶级以无比坚强的胜利信心，继续对敌人展开斗争。一部分工人把工厂、机器搬到北部山地，继续进行生产。另一部分工人拿起武器，展开游击战争或在敌后坚持地下活动。汉城地区的铁路工人几乎全部参加了汉城保卫战。高原煤矿、江原道佳恩铅矿的工人都组织起游击队。元山造船所工人所组织的游击队先后和敌人作战五十多次，歼灭敌军八百多人，还缴获了许多枪炮弹药。
    平壤第二织袜厂十六岁的青年工人权用洙在东平壤的集中营里做地下工作，前后救出了被囚在集中营里的一百五十多个爱国者。他自己受到敌人的酷刑拷问，始终坚贞不屈。咸镜北道吉州县铁路机务段司机李敏哲没有来得及撤退，被敌人逮捕了。敌人强迫他驾驶军用列车，李敏哲怀着对美、李匪帮的深刻仇恨，在把列车驶至镜城县龙岘村和朴乙村之间的铁桥时，机智地把机车以外的全部车辆颠覆，自己逃到山里打游击。
    在朝、中人民军队发动强大反攻，迅速光复了广大地区之后，朝鲜铁路工人们就提出“军队打到那里，铁路就修到那里！”的战斗口号。他们和中国志愿援朝铁路工人在一起，不顾严冬的酷寒和敌机的疯狂轰炸扫射，在极端艰苦危险的条件下，并肩抢修铁路。在今年一、二月两个月中，工人们共修复了三百六十四处被敌人破坏的铁道、桥梁和加水站。
    其他各部门的工人同样地发挥着献身精神，全力恢复工厂，并展开增产斗争。在朝鲜工人阶级的努力下，各地工厂、企业的恢复工作，正迅速地进行。以平壤为例，被敌人破坏的平壤市电灯、自来水，在平壤解放后不到二十天，水电就恢复了供应。
    朝鲜的工人们知道前面还有着长期艰苦的战斗，他们正满怀信心，准备克服一切困难，向胜利前进。
