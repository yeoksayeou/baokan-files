Meeting General Kim Il-sung's Subordinates
    Yang Shuo

　　On a spring night when cherry blossoms were in full bloom, the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, carrying banners and gifts gathered from Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, and every corner of China, presented them to the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army. These were no simple gifts. Embroidered on the banners were the most precious sentiments of the Chinese people, and packed in the boxes were the fiery hearts of millions upon millions of Chinese people. At that instant, when Liao Chengzhi, the head of the delegation, and General Kim Chaewook of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army embraced, the hearts of the two brotherly nations were embraced even more tightly.

　　The Korean People's Army under the command of General Kim Il-sung is entirely worthy of such love from the Chinese people. Once, at a combat hero symposium, I met many individuals who had received the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They wore dazzling national flag medals or gold star medals on their chests, and they were brave and strong. Among them was the young tank driver Kim Ki-gyu, who was the first to plant a flag on Syngman Rhee's building when the People's Army first captured Seoul. The taciturn anti-aircraft gun hero Kim Hyun-shul led a hunter-killer team, constantly changing positions, and shot down nine enemy planes. People felt that there must be amazing details inside, and when asked about the process of shooting them down, he said plainly: "You try firing a few shots, and they'll fall down." After saying a few words, he sat down again.

　　Tank Battalion Commander Kim Doo-seop was a company commander at the beginning of the war, leading his troops to counterattack the enemy south of the 38th parallel. The enemy's firepower was fierce, and heavy machine gun bullets shook the tank. The heat inside the tank was also high, and they couldn't wear clothes, so they took off their clothes and shirts, and charged into the enemy's position bare-chested, with the tank tracks crushing many enemies to death. The enemy attacked with more than a dozen armored vehicles. The first armored vehicle was crashed by Kim Doo-seop and thrown five or six meters away. A jeep was also smashed by him, and the American advisors sitting on it were crushed into mud. Unfortunately, while pursuing the enemy, his tank was trapped in a mud puddle. The water soaked half of the tank, and the machine gun couldn't fire. The enemy noticed and turned around to counterattack. Kim Doo-seop called on the tank soldiers and said: "The time has come for the motherland and the people! The tank is the property of the people, and we will live and die with the tank!" They then took up rifles and grenades and fought the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. ...

　　"For the motherland! For the people!" Victory is achieved in such noble oaths. But their actions have even greater significance. They are also shedding precious blood for the peace and happiness of all mankind.

　　We were listening to the heroes report their deeds to the delegation in turn when a deputy battalion commander named Kim Song-wan stood up and said: "I want to report to the dear Chinese comrades in Chinese..."

　　Those listening whispered: "He's back from China."

　　That's right, and he's not the only one. In the People's Army's artillery, infantry, tank corps, air force, and even in the military hospitals, you can meet many Korean comrades who look at you with a smile, speak Chinese, and hold your hand tightly. They had all participated in China's revolutionary war, shed blood, and made meritorious contributions, and had also buried their sacrificed comrades on Chinese soil. Kang Wencai, the automatic gun squad leader, is one of these many people. This young hero is only twenty years old, with long eyebrows, narrow eyes, and a slight smile, said:

　　"I joined the People's Liberation Army in the autumn of 1947 in the Northeast. I was only sixteen years old at that time, and I didn't understand much of the principles, I only knew that no matter if I was Korean or whatever, once I joined the People's Liberation Army, I wouldn't be bullied. Now, of course, I understand this principle, that is to say: Mao Zedong is not only the great savior of the Chinese people, but also the great savior of all oppressed peoples in the East. At that time, it happened to be the Battle of Siping. Our team inserted into the enemy's rear to sabotage transportation. One evening, a comrade and I went to blow up an important bridge. An enemy sentry was standing at the bridgehead. We crawled up, put a rope around his neck, tightened the buckle and said: "If you shout, I won't live, and you won't live either!" After saying that, the comrade took the prisoner away first. I climbed onto the bridge and groped to install explosives, but was accidentally discovered by the enemy on the other side. The enemy started shooting. My right arm suddenly shook, and my hand was soft, I was hit. I gritted my teeth and lit the explosives. As soon as I ran to the bridgehead, the bridge exploded, throwing me more than ten feet away, and I fainted from the shock."

　　The Chinese people will never forget the great contribution he made. Since then, he fought from north to south, and was wounded twice more, until he fought in Guangxi. When his motherland Korea was subjected to new aggression, he transferred to the battlefield of his own motherland. But who can forget the benefits of China?

　　In a certain army corps, General Cui Yin, who participated in the Li Hongguang Detachment of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, said thoughtfully when talking about China: "I will definitely go to China again in the future."

　　The comrades of the delegation said: "That's right, after Korea's victory, you can go to Beijing and Qingdao for recuperation."

　　Cui Yin smiled and said: "No, I want to go to Yan'an to see. I dug a lot of cave dwellings in Yan'an, and I dream of seeing this land that nurtured me. Without the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, the victory of the Korean War is unimaginable."

　　We laughed: "You also contributed to China's victory, didn't you?"

　　Cui Yin said seriously: "The Volunteer Army in Korea is the one who really contributed!"

　　These two nations have encountered a common destiny, experienced common battles, and the friendship forged in life and death is the most sincere and moving. Another army corps general recalled the time when they joined forces with the Volunteer Army and sighed:

　　"Our soldiers will never forget that day! At that time, one of our divisions fought to the far south of Korea. After the enemy landed in Incheon, we followed General Kim Il-sung's order and fought all the way back to the Lianchuan area. Many of our cadres were returned from China, so we brought China's experience over, established the Party, established the mass armed forces, and opened up base areas. At that time, when we heard the enemy's broadcast saying: The Chinese Volunteer Army is here, we didn't dare to believe it. We also heard the villagers everywhere say: Many troops have come from the north, and they speak differently. We didn't know who they were. We waited day and night, and finally waited for that Volunteer Army that rushed from China through the wind and snow! When the two sides met, you hugged me, I hugged you, and tears fell down, and we didn't know what to say. When the Volunteer Army comrades saw that we were still wearing single clothes in the severe winter and snow, they took off their cotton clothes and gave them to us. ..."

　　This kind of life-and-death friendship has been deeply engraved in the hearts of the People's Army soldiers. No wonder when they saw the Chinese delegation, they were closer than seeing their own flesh and blood. A soldier ran over, shook the hand of a comrade in the delegation, tears welled up in his eyes, and he couldn't say a word. Another young soldier saluted one of our female comrades, took out his most precious diary and handed it over, with the words: "For the Chinese comrades!" The Korean comrades who returned from China held our hands tightly and just said: "I never thought I would see you here again!"

　　General Kim Il, the Director of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army, said when bidding farewell to the delegation: "Please convey the thanks of the entire Korean People's Army to the Chinese people, and say that our entire People's Army loves Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!"

　　会见金日成将军的部下
    杨朔
    一个樱花盛开的春夜。中国人民赴朝慰问团捧着从新疆、蒙古、西藏和中国各个角落集拢来的锦旗、礼品，献给了朝鲜人民军最高司令部。这不是简单的礼物。旗上绣的是中国人民最珍贵的情意，箱子里装的是千千万万颗中国人民火热的心。当那一霎那，慰问团团长廖承志和人民军总政治局金载郁将军拥抱在一起时，两个兄弟民族的心是更紧地交抱在一起了。
    在金日成将军指挥下的朝鲜人民军完全值得中国人民这样的热爱。有一次开战斗英雄座谈会，我见到许多获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄称号的人物。他们的前胸挂着耀眼的国旗勋章或者金星章，英挺而刚强。当中有年青的坦克手金箕奎，他在人民军第一次攻占汉城时，第一个把旗子插在李承晚的大楼上。沉默寡言的高射炮英雄金玄沭带着猎机小组，随时转换阵地，前后击落九架敌机。人家觉得内里一定有惊人的细节，问他击落的经过，他却平平淡淡地说：“你先试射几下，一打就打下来了。”说了三言两语又坐下去了。
    坦克营长金斗燮在战争初期是个连长，带着队伍向三八线以南反击敌人。敌人的火力猛，重机枪子弹打得坦克直摇动。坦克里的热度又高，衣服穿不住了，他们就脱下衣服和衬衣，光着膀子一直冲进敌人的阵地，坦克的履带碾死许多敌人。敌人用十几辆装甲车进攻，第一辆装甲车被金斗燮一撞，摔出五、六米远。一辆吉普车也被他碰碎，上边坐的美国顾问被碾成了烂泥。但不幸在追击敌人时，他的坦克陷进了泥塘。水浸到坦克的半身，机枪不能射击。敌人发觉了，扭回头反冲。金斗燮号召坦克手说：“为祖国为人民的时候到了！坦克是人民的财产，我们要与坦克共存亡！”他们便拿起步枪和手榴弹跟敌人肉搏。………
    “为祖国！为人民！”胜利就在这种高贵的誓词里取得。但他们的行动有着更高的意义。他们也是在为全人类的和平幸福流着宝贵的鲜血。
    我们正听着英雄们轮流向慰问团报告自己的事迹，一个叫金松万的副大队长站起来说：“我要用中国话向亲爱的中国同志报告……”。
    听的人悄悄议论：“这是从中国回来的。”
    不错，还不止他一个人呢。在人民军的炮兵、步兵、坦克兵、空军，以至于军医院里，到处可以遇见许多朝鲜同志望着你笑，说着中国话，握着你的手不放。他们都曾参加过中国的革命战争，流过血、立过功，也曾在中国的土地上掩埋过自己的牺牲的同伴。自动炮小队长康文彩就是这许许多多人当中的一个。这位年青的英雄只有二十岁，长眉，细眼，微微笑着说：
    “我是一九四七年秋天在东北参加解放军的。那时才十六岁，道理也不大懂，光知道不管自己是朝鲜人也好，什么人也好，一参加解放军就不受气了。现在当然认清了这个道理，那就是说：毛泽东不但是中国人民的大救星，也是所有东方被压迫民族的大救星。当时正赶上打四平，我们的队伍插到敌人后方，破坏交通。有一天晚间，我跟一个同志去炸一座重要的桥梁。桥头站着一个敌人的哨兵，我们爬着摸上去，拿绳子往他脖子上一套，拉紧扣说：“你叫，我活不了，你也活不成！”说罢就由那个同志先把俘虏带走了。我爬上桥，摸摸索索装炸药，不小心被对岸的敌人发觉了。敌人打起枪来。我的右膀子忽然一震，手也发软，挂彩了。我咬着牙点上炸药，刚跑到桥头，桥炸了，把我颠出一丈多远，震得昏过去。”
    中国人民永远不会忘记他立的这一大功。此后，他从北打到南，又挂过两次花，一直打到广西。在他的祖国朝鲜遭到新的侵略时，他就转到自己祖国的战场上。但是谁又能忘记中国的好处呢？
    在一个军团里，参加过抗联李红光支队的崔殷将军谈到中国时，沉思着说：“将来我一定要再到中国去一趟。”
    慰问团的同志说：“对了，等朝鲜胜利后，你可以到北京、青岛去休养休养。”
    崔殷笑了笑说：“不，我想去延安看看。我在延安挖了不少窑洞，做梦也想去看看这块培养过我的土地。没有中国共产党的胜利，朝鲜战争的胜利也不可想像。”
    我们笑道：“中国的胜利，你不是也有功？”
    崔殷严肃地说：“志愿军在朝鲜才真有功呢！”
    这两个民族遭遇过共同的命运，经历过共同的战斗，在生死患难里结成的友谊也最真切动人。另一个军团的将领回想起他们和志愿军会师时，慨叹着说：
    “我们的将士永远也忘不了那一天！那时候，我们一个师打到朝鲜的大南边，敌人从仁川一登陆，又奉金日成将军的命令，一路打回涟川一带。我们的干部很多是从中国回来的，我们就把中国的经验搬过来，建党，建立群众武装，开辟了根据地。当时听见敌人广播说：中国志愿军来了，也不敢信。又听老乡到处传说：北边来了许多部队，说话不一样。我们也不知道是些什么人。日里盼，夜里盼，到底盼着了那支冲风冒雪从中国赶来的志愿军！两方面一见，你抱我，我抱你，泪都流下来了，也不知说什么好。志愿军的同志看见我们隆冬风雪还穿着单衣，就把棉衣都脱下来，送给我们。……”
    这种生死交情已经深深地刻在人民军将士的心里。难怪他们一见中国慰问团，比见到亲骨肉还亲。一个战士跑过来，握着慰问团同志的手，眼里转着泪花，话都说不出。另一个小战士给我们一位女同志敬个礼，掏出他最珍贵的日记本递过来，上面写着：“送给中国同志！”从中国回来的朝鲜同志紧握着我们的手，只是说：“想不到在这里又见到你们了！”
    人民军总政治局金日将军在送别慰问团时说：“请把全朝鲜人民军的感谢带给中国人民，并说我们全体人民军都热爱着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席！”
