The native product market in the Southwest Administrative Region is becoming active, and the sales of general native products have begun to flow smoothly. Taking Chongqing as an example (the situation in other places is roughly similar to Chongqing), firstly, the transaction volume and output of native products have generally increased. Compared with January, the transaction volume of buffalo hides increased by 421%, and the output increased by 408%. The transaction volume of dried vegetables increased by 485%, and the output increased by 122%. Other products such as green hemp, Chinese gall, and dwarf lilyturf have also increased significantly. Secondly, the prices of native products have generally risen reasonably. Goods that had been unsalable for many years have now found sales outlets. Goods that were once unsalable can now be sold again. From the perspective of the annual production and sales situation, black tea, fur, hemp, white wax, lacquer wax, flue-cured tobacco, and Xia cloth are in short supply.

The active native product market has greatly improved the operating enthusiasm of private merchants. Farmers' belief in the government has also increased. Comrades in ethnic minority areas who previously did not want trade companies now warmly welcome trade companies.

In order to develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, especially to facilitate the smooth sales of native products, the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee has taken a series of important measures, such as reducing the Yichang-Chongqing section of the Yangtze River shipping costs for 33 kinds of native products, canceling the return empty fee for automobile transportation, and reducing the Ping An insurance rate for wooden boat transportation of 116 kinds of native products. Financial and economic committees at all levels and relevant departments have also provided strong cooperation.

Within the trade system itself, the following efforts have been made:

I. Organize intra-regional exchanges. At the three trade fairs at the beginning of the year, 31 contracts were signed between provinces and regions, with a total value of more than 11 billion yuan (which has now begun to be fulfilled). Mutual transportation of goods to various places for trial sales was organized between provinces and regions; mutual assistance was provided in finding sales outlets; and mutual consignment sales were arranged. In addition, close contact was maintained with production departments and user departments to open up sales channels for native products.

II. Promote sales outside the region. The regional trade department has established native product sales offices in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Xi'an and other places. In one month, Guangzhou sold 1.5 billion yuan worth of native products. In addition, the regional native product company has also signed native product promotion agreements with native product companies in other regions for goods worth more than 30 billion yuan.

III. Improve quality and packaging. For example, during the production season of榨菜 (zha cai, pickled mustard tuber) in Fuling, eastern Sichuan, a mass quality inspection committee led by the government was organized. All 榨菜 exported outside the region must be inspected and approved before they can be exported. Changing the packaging of Chinese gall from round to square saves one-third of the tonnage and reduces transportation costs.

IV. In order to organize and guide the operation of private merchants, private merchant symposiums and research meetings have been held in various places. In addition to publicity and explanation, opinions from private merchants were solicited and problems raised by private merchants were resolved. Chongqing, northern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan have adopted the method of buying and selling to private merchants to stabilize prices and facilitate the turnover of private merchants. Western Sichuan organized 800 million yuan of private idle funds to establish Shufeng Company to operate medicinal materials and tea. Guizhou and Xikang and other places organized post transportation, which greatly improved the operating enthusiasm of private merchants.

In addition, the investigation and research of native product data, compiled into books, and guidance work has also played a certain role.

There are still some problems in the exchange of native products that need to be resolved quickly.

I. Simplification of procedures. Currently, merchants who transport goods to Chongqing for sale have to go through 18 procedures; purchasing goods requires 14 procedures. It takes several days, which affects the exchange of native products. Active research and improvement are underway.

II. Expanding the variety of operations and guiding production in a planned manner. The long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries has caused many native products in the Southwest region to be unsalable for a long time, greatly reducing production, and even shutting down production. After liberation, the People's Government was busy clearing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and returning deposits, and had not yet had time to restore and develop native products, so there was a shortage of certain commodities. In the future, production should be developed from expanding the variety of operations, resolving public-private relations, and organizing the production of native products in a planned manner.

III. Expanding and consolidating sales outlets. When certain commodities are selling well, private merchants are competing to purchase them, and prices are rising too quickly, state-owned companies should appropriately adopt the method of buying and selling, and explain and educate producers, correct the mentality of "the more expensive the less I sell", and adjust them in a timely manner to take care of the interests of production, transportation and sales. It is also necessary to educate producers and transporters to maintain and continue to improve the quality of products.

It is necessary to provide as much convenience as possible to foreign merchants, attract them to purchase in producing areas (or distribution centers), invigorate the producing area market, and open up sales outlets for new native products.

### 西南土产打开销路

　　西南土产打开销路
    西南行政区土产市场走向活跃，一般土产品的销路开始畅通。以重庆为例（其他各地情况大体与重庆相仿），首先是土产品的成交量与输出量一般地增加了。以三月份与一月份相较，水牛皮成交量增加百分之四百二十一，输出量增加百分之四百零八。干菜类成交量增加百分之四百八十五，输出量增加百分之一百二十二。其他青麻、五棓子、麦冬等，都有显著的增加。其次，土产品的价格，一般都合理地上升了。多年滞销的货物，现已找到销路。一度滞销的货物也都又能销售了。红茶、皮毛类、麻、白腊、漆腊、烤烟、夏布等，从全年的产销情况看，已呈供不应求之势。
    土产市场的活跃，使私商的经营情绪大大提高了。农民对政府的信仰更加提高了。少数民族地区的同胞以前不愿意要贸易公司，现在热烈欢迎贸易公司了。
    为发展城乡内外物资交流，特别是为了便利土产畅销，西南财政经济委员会曾采取了一系列的重要措施，如减低三十三种土产的渝宜段轮船运费，取消汽车运输回空费，降低一百十六种土产品的木船运输平安险费率等。各级财政经济委员会与有关部门也做了有力的配合。
    在贸易系统本身，曾作了以下各方面的努力。
    一、组织区内交流。在年初的三次贸易会上，组织各省区之间签订合约三十一份，总值一百一十余亿元（现已开始履行）。并在各省区之间组织互相带货到各地试销；互相帮助找销路；互相委托代销。此外，并与生产部门、需用部门密切联系，为土产开辟销路。
    二、到区外推销。区贸易部已在广州、上海、汉口、西安等地设立土产推销处。一个月时间，广州就推销了价值十五亿元的土产。另外，区土产公司还与其他区土产公司订立了约值三百余亿元的货物的推销土产协议书。
    三、提高品质，改善包装工作。如川东涪陵的榨菜，在生产季节，组织了由政府领导的群众性的品格检验委员会。凡输出区外的榨菜，均须经过检验，取得许可，才能输出。五棓子由圆包改为方包，节省吨位三分之一，减低了运输成本。
    四、为组织指导私商经营，各地都召开了私商座谈会、研究会。除宣传解释外，并征询私商意见，解决私商所提出的问题。重庆、川北、川南等地采取对私商有买有卖的办法，平稳价格，便于私商周转；川西组织私人游资八亿元，成立蜀丰公司，经营药材和茶叶；贵州及西康等地组织驿运等，使私商经营情绪大为提高。
    此外，调查研究土产资料，汇编成册，指导工作，也起了一定作用。
    在土产交流中，目前还存在着一些问题，应迅速解决。
    一、简化手续问题。现在行商贩货到重庆销售，要经十八道手续；进货要经十四道手续。费时均需数日，影响土产交流。现正积极研究改进。
    二、扩大经营品种，并有计划地指导生产问题。国民党反动派的长期统治，使西南区许多土产品长期滞销，大大减产，甚至停产了。解放后人民政府忙于清剿土匪、反恶霸、减租、退押等工作，还没有来得及恢复和发展土产，所以产生某些商品供不应求之势。今后应从扩大经营品种中来发展生产，解决公私关系，并有计划地组织土产生产。
    三、扩大与巩固销路问题。当某些商品因销路畅旺，私商争购，价格上涨太快时，国营公司应适当采取有买有卖的办法，并向生产者进行解释、教育，纠正“越贵越不卖”的心理，及时加以调节，照顾产运销三方面的利益。并要教育生产者与贩运者，保持并继续提高产品品质。
    要尽可能给外地商人以便利，吸引他们到产地（或集散地）来采购，活跃产地市场，并为新的土产打开销路。
