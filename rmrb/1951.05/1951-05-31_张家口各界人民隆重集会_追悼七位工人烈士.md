Wang Youcheng, a representative of the workers of Zhangjiakou, raised his fist and swore before the portraits of the martyrs: "We must use more brilliant production achievements to avenge the martyrs. We are ready to go to the front line at any time to complete the unfinished business of the martyrs!"

We must learn from him and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the American devils!"
