Introducing a Typical Family Patriotic Pact
    Li Fanfu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee South China Branch
    The Guangzhou "United Daily" published an article on May 8th on page four written by female worker Ye Lixin, "Introducing Our Family Pact," which is vivid and touching. A family of four, the husband is a tricycle worker, the wife is a female worker. In the past, the couple often quarreled and had no plans for spending money, so they could not make ends meet. Since the establishment of the family pact, the family has gradually changed from a frequently quarreling one to a harmonious, happy, hardworking, learning, and patriotic one. The political awareness and cultural knowledge of the couple and the younger sister have greatly improved. This is worth learning for millions of families. Although the specific circumstances of each family are different, it would be extremely meaningful if each family could formulate a family pact according to its specific circumstances, and if they could all combine the patriotic pact with the family pact, and combine patriotism with practical life, like Ye Lixin's family.
    Under the rule of the reactionary government, there could be no happy families. Now the times are different, the people have become the masters of the country, and every people's family has the conditions to gradually transform into a happy and joyful family. The question is whether they are good at using these conditions. In the past, the reactionaries used to spread rumors that the Communist Party did not want families, or that the Communist Party only advocated family struggles and not family harmony. These were all deliberate slanders. The founder of communism, Marx, had a very lovely family. Although Marx was extremely poor in those years, he and his wife Jenny lived very well. They respected and loved each other and greatly encouraged his career. Of course, if there are principled differences in ideology within a family, such as one advocating patriotism and the other not understanding patriotism, then progress cannot be made without struggle to overcome backwardness. But there are various forms of struggle, such as criticism and persuasion, and it does not necessarily have to be quarreling. If the family is ideologically consistent, they will not quarrel frequently over trivial matters. In the family, it is necessary to promote democracy and appropriate criticism and self-criticism. The experience of Ye Lixin in establishing a family pact is worth introducing because they used self-criticism to replace unprincipled quarrels. This is also worth promoting. May millions of people's families become lovely families, and know how to defend their families and their country.
    After the grand May Day demonstration parade, we must bring the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to a deeper stage, and everyone must be truly educated in patriotism. Establishing a patriotic pact and a family pact (the two can be combined, and should be combined) is one of the important methods to popularize and deepen this movement. In cities, patriotic pacts of various institutions and people's organizations have generally been established, and the issue now is to implement them in depth. As for establishing family patriotic pacts among the broad masses of the people, in many places it is only a beginning, and in many places it has not yet been carried out. I hope everyone will promote it and use the method of introducing advanced experiences to promote this movement. I will first introduce Ye Lixin's experience in establishing a family pact, and I hope that better experiences will appear in the future.

### 介绍一个典型的家庭爱国公约

　　介绍一个典型的家庭爱国公约
    中共中央华南分局宣传部副部长  李凡夫
    五月八日广州《联合报》第四版刊有女工叶丽馨写的“介绍我们的家庭公约”，内容生动感人。一个四口的家庭，丈夫是三轮车工人，妻子是女工，过去夫妻经常吵架，用钱无计划，因此入不敷出。自从订立了家庭公约后，就由经常吵架的家庭逐渐变为和睦幸福努力工作学习和热爱祖国的家庭，夫妇和妹妹的政治认识和文化知识有很大提高。这是值得千百万个家庭学习的。虽然各个家庭的具体情况不同，但每个家庭如果都能按照具体情况订立一个家庭公约，并且都能像叶丽馨的家庭那样，把爱国公约与家庭公约结合起来，把爱国主义与实际生活结合起来，那是极有意义的事。
    在反动政府统治下，不可能有幸福的家庭。现在时代不同了，人民已成为国家的主人，每个人民的家庭，都有了逐渐改造为幸福而愉快的家庭的条件，问题在于是否善于利用这些条件。过去反动派曾经造谣说，共产党是不要家庭的，或说共产党是只主张家庭斗争而不主张家庭和睦的，这都是有意诬蔑。共产主义的创始者马克思就有一个非常可爱的家庭，马克思当年虽然万分穷困，但他与他的夫人燕妮却过得很好，两人相敬相爱，对他的事业有很大的鼓励。当然，如果在一个家庭中，在思想上有原则分歧，如一个主张爱国，一个对爱国还不了解，这样，不斗争就不能克服落后，不能进步。但斗争也有各种方式，可以批评劝说，不一定就要吵架。如果家庭中思想一致，就不会因细小事情而经常吵架了。在家庭中，提倡民主，提倡适当的批评和自我批评是必要的。叶丽馨订立家庭公约经验所以值得介绍，还由于他们用检讨的方式来代替了无原则的吵架。这也是值得提倡的。愿千百万人民的家庭都成为可爱的家庭，并且要知道如何来保卫自己的家庭与自己的祖国。
    我们在“五一”盛大的示威游行之后，必须使抗美援朝运动走上深入的阶段，必须使每个人都真正受到爱国主义的教育，而订立爱国公约与家庭公约（两者可以结合起来，也应该结合起来），就是普及与深入这个运动的重要方法之一。在城市中，各机关各人民团体的爱国公约一般都已订立，今后是深入贯彻的问题。至于在广大人民群众中订立家庭爱国公约，有许多地方还仅是一个开始，有许多地方则尚未进行。希望大家都来提倡，并用介绍先进经验的方法来推动这个运动。我先来介绍叶丽馨订立家庭公约的经验，希望以后还有更好的经验出现。
