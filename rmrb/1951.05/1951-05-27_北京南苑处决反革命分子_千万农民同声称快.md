　　Execution of Counter-Revolutionaries in Nanyuan, Beijing
    Millions of Peasants Cheer in Unison

To the Editor:

    On May 22nd, Beijing's Nanyuan executed thirty-two counter-revolutionary criminals. Tens of thousands of people rushed to witness the execution of their enemies.

    As early as eight o'clock in the morning, people from Ruihezhuang, Shitaizhuang, Sihaizhuang and other villages traveled from more than twenty miles away to Nanyuan. District cadres asked in surprise, "Isn't the meeting supposed to start at twelve o'clock?" They all quickly replied, "Today's meeting is about settling scores; everyone came early."

    The meeting began, and the villagers sat motionless under the scorching sun, listening to the government announce the names and crimes of the counter-revolutionary criminals. When the name of the local tyrant Zhang Ruqian was announced, the people of Shitaizhuang immediately shouted with joy, "Scores settled!" When the thirty-first name was read, the people of You'anmen had not yet heard the name of their village's local tyrant, Tian Deyu. Farmer Dong Yucheng said, "Well, there's no hope again; when will we ever get revenge?" But then the thirty-second name was Tian Deyu, and they felt like a weight had been lifted from their hearts, immediately shouting slogans such as "Support the People's Government" and "Long Live Chairman Mao."

    When the public security personnel announced that they could enter the execution ground to see the ugly state of the counter-revolutionary criminals after their execution, the masses rushed towards the execution ground. The mother of Shi Xiulan, who had been ill for eight years, also struggled to run towards the execution ground, gasping for breath. Zhang Yu Pu of Ruihezhuang ran in the forefront, saying, "The local tyrant Qiu Shulin used to make me carry the banner for his dog's funeral; today I can see how he died!" The people of Xihongmen shouted as they ran, "Let's each take a bite out of Chen Zibin and Zhao Yunchang!" At the execution ground, the villagers were especially looking for the enemies who had persecuted them. After more than sixty people from Majiabao found the body of Yang Jinfang, a special agent and local tyrant from the village, Sun Baoxiang said, "We wasted too much time looking for your name. Every time the government executes counter-revolutionaries, we rush to see the announcements, but we never found your name. Today we finally found you!" Wang Wenxiu angrily hit the corpse of the local tyrant Yang Jinfang with a clod of earth, saying, "Finally avenged my dead wife! (Wang Wenxiu's wife was raped by the local tyrant Yang Jinfang when she was seven months pregnant, resulting in bleeding and death.)" Farmer Dong Yucheng from You'anmen kicked the corpse of the local tyrant Tian Deyu hard, pointing to the knife mark on his face and saying to everyone, "This fellow Tian Deyu cut me with a broadsword, forcing me to not dare to live in the village. I have suffered so much bullying from him, and today I finally got revenge." Farmer Li Yongxiang from Xihongmen beat the corpse of the special agent and local tyrant Zhao Yunchang with a wooden board, gasping for breath as he said, "My wife was raped and then trafficked by you, and my father was angered to death by you. Now I finally feel relieved!" The corpses of the thirty-two counter-revolutionaries were surrounded by the masses, recounting the crimes of the counter-revolutionary criminals during their lives.

    At more than two o'clock in the afternoon, the Nanjiao Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau invited thirty-seven people who had been harmed by the counter-revolutionary criminals to a meeting. Everyone painfully recounted their hatred for the counter-revolutionaries, expressing the joy of seeing their enemies shot dead with their own eyes. The mother of Shi Xiuzhen, who was beaten to death by the local tyrant Yang Ziyuan, happily said, "With the counter-revolutionaries shot dead, we can live a truly secure life." Zhang Liting, who was beaten with a lever and force-fed cold water by the special agent and local tyrant Chen Zibin, stood up and said, "We have been liberated and received land, houses, and farm tools, and our production is going well. Now that the government has shot dead the counter-revolutionary criminals who killed us, we have avenged decades of injustice; there is nothing more joyous than this!" Dong Yucheng said, "In the past, it was their world, and we had no place to vent our anger. Without Chairman Mao, we would never be able to avenge this hatred." Finally, Zhang Liting proposed, "Chairman Mao has done another great thing for us; we must pay our respects to Chairman Mao." Everyone immediately stood up and saluted Chairman Mao, shouting slogans such as "Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries" and "Long Live Chairman Mao."

　　北京南苑处决反革命分子
    千万农民同声称快编辑同志：
    北京市南苑在五月二十二日处决了三十二名反革命罪犯。成千成万的群众赶来看他们的仇人的伏法。
    早上八点钟，瑞合庄、石太庄、四海庄等村群众就从二十多里外赶到南苑来。区干部很奇怪地问：“不是十二点才开会吗？”他们都很快地回答：“今天是解决问题的会，大家都早些赶来了。”
    开会了，乡亲们坐在火热的太阳下动也不动地听着政府宣布反革命罪犯的名单及罪状。当宣布恶霸地主张汝谦的名字时，石太庄群众马上高兴得叫起来：“解决问题了！”当读到第三十一个名字时，右安门群众还没听到本村恶霸地主田德玉的名字，农民董玉成说：“得了，又没指望了；什么时候才能报仇呀？”但接着第三十二名便是田德玉，他们心里像一块石头落了地，马上高呼“拥护人民政府”、“毛主席万岁”等口号。
    当公安人员宣布可以进入刑场看反革命罪犯伏法后的丑态时，群众都赶着跑向刑场。病了八年的石秀兰的母亲气喘喘地也争着向刑场跑。瑞合庄张玉普跑在最前边，他说：“恶霸地主邱树林过去叫我给他的狗打幡送丧，今天我可看见他是怎么死的了！”西红门群众一面跑一面喊：“咱们一人把陈子彬、赵运昌咬一口去！”在刑场里，乡亲们都特别寻找迫害过自己的仇人。马家堡六十多个群众找到该村特务、恶霸杨金芳的尸身后，孙宝祥说：“我们为找你的名字，耽误时间太多了。每逢政府处决反革命分子，我们都跑去看布告，始终没有找到你的名字。今天可找到了！”王文秀气愤地用土块狠打恶霸杨金芳的死尸，说：“总算给我死去的妻子报了仇！（王文秀的妻子在怀孕七月时被恶霸杨金芳强奸，以致流血身死）”右安门农民董玉成狠狠地踢了恶霸地主田德玉的死尸一脚，指着自己脸上的刀痕向大家说：“田德玉这小子用大刀砍我，逼的我不敢在村里住。我受了他多大的欺负，今天才报了仇。”西红门农民李永祥用木板狠打特务、恶霸地主赵运昌的死尸，他气得喘不上气地说：“我的妻子被你强奸了之后又拐卖了，我父亲被你气死了。现在可解了我的气！”三十二个反革命分子的死尸旁都围满了群众，诉说着反革命罪犯生前的罪恶。
    下午两点多钟，北京市公安局南郊分局请了三十七位被反革命罪犯残害的人开会。大家痛述他们对反革命分子的仇恨，表示了亲眼看到他们仇人被枪毙的快乐。被恶霸地主杨子元毒打身死的石秀珍的母亲很高兴地说：“把反革命分子枪毙了，咱们过日子可真踏实了。”被特务、恶霸地主陈子彬压杠子灌凉水毒打过的张立廷立起来说：“咱们翻身分到土地、房屋、农具，生产搞得好，现在政府把杀害咱们的反革命罪犯枪毙了，咱们报了几十年的冤仇，那里还有这么高兴的事！”董玉成说：“以前是人家的天下，咱们有气也没有地方出。没有毛主席，咱们这仇什么时候也报不了。”最后，张立廷提议：“毛主席为咱们又办了件大喜事，我们要向毛主席致敬。”大家马上立起向毛主席敬礼，并高呼着“坚决镇压反革命”、“毛主席万岁”等口号。
