　　Qinghai Provincial Health Department Medical Team
    Goes Deep into Fraternal Minority Areas to Provide Free Medical Treatment
    The medical team organized by the Qinghai Provincial People's Government Health Department has gone deep into rural areas and fraternal minority regions to carry out spring epidemic prevention and free treatment work, which is deeply welcomed by people of all ethnic groups. The medical team, consisting of 24 doctors and nurses, has been conducting mobile medical services in the rural areas of six counties, including Huzhu and Huangzhong, since late February. They have worked with the health centers of various counties to vaccinate 300,000 people of all ethnic groups against smallpox, provided free treatment for various diseases to more than 7,400 people, and eradicated infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox in Huzhu and Huangzhong counties. They also opened a new-style midwifery training class in Shangwuzhuang fraternal minority area of Huangzhong County, with 63 trainees from all ethnic groups participating. People of all ethnic groups expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the People's Government for caring about their health. Whenever the medical team leaves, people of all ethnic groups, young and old, come to see them off, and shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" in different languages.
    Recently, the provincial health department organized two more medical teams, which went to pastoral areas such as Qilian and Gangcha on March 26 to provide treatment.

　　青海省卫生处医疗队
    深入兄弟民族地区免费治病
    青海省人民政府卫生处组织的医疗队深入农村及兄弟民族地区进行春季防疫与免费治疗工作，深受各民族人民的欢迎。该医疗队由医生、护士二十四人组成，于二月下旬起先后赴互助、湟中等六县农村进行巡回医疗。他们曾会同各县卫生院给各民族三十万人种了牛痘，给七千四百多人免费治疗了各种疾病，扑灭了互助、湟中两县的麻疹、天花等传染病。他们并在湟中县上午庄兄弟民族地区开办了新法接生训练班，参加学习的各民族学员有六十三人。各民族人民对人民政府关心他们的健康，表示衷心感激。每当医疗队离开时，各民族的人民均扶老携幼前来欢送，并以不同的语言高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    最近该省卫生处又组织了两个医疗组，于三月二十六日分赴祁连、刚察等游牧地区进行治疗。
