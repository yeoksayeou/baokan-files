Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th Dispatch from TASS on the 23rd: On May 7th of this year, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Bogomolov, handed a document titled "Soviet Opinions on the US Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" to the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Kirk.
The full text of the opinion is as follows:
"On March 29th of this year, the Soviet government received the US government's draft of the peace treaty with Japan. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to express the following opinions:
　　Although more than five years have passed since the end of the war against Japan, the issue of a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been resolved. The creation of this situation is primarily due to the attitude of the US government, which, under various pretexts, not only delays the conclusion of the peace treaty but even delays the preparation of the peace treaty. The US government has therefore repeatedly rejected the Soviet government's suggestions to jointly prepare a peace treaty with other countries' governments in accordance with the relevant international agreements. As a result, the time of the occupation of Japan by foreign troops has been prolonged, which is unacceptable.

　　(I) The Soviet government believes that the preparation work for the peace treaty with Japan is incorrect to begin with.
　　The US government attached a memorandum to the US draft peace treaty, which stated that the draft was formulated after representatives of the US government exchanged views with the governments of several other countries, including the Soviet government. It should be pointed out that this statement is incorrect, because the Soviet government issued a statement as early as the beginning of March this year, refusing to conduct separate negotiations with US representatives for the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet government's refusal to conduct separate negotiations was based on the premise that the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan cannot be the affair of one government, or for it to solicit the opinions of other relevant governments, but must be a joint affair of all these countries, as stipulated by the relevant international agreements. However, the US government did not abandon the separate preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, but tried its best to monopolize this right, which violated its obligations in jointly preparing the peace treaty with Japan with the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom and with the participation of other relevant countries.
　　According to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement of August 2, 1945, the Council of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France has been established. The Potsdam Agreement clearly stipulates that the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers is primarily for "the preparation of peace treaties." When drafting various peace treaties, "the council will be composed of members who signed the surrender documents of the relevant enemy countries." The peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland were prepared and signed in accordance with this provision. According to the aforementioned Potsdam Agreement, the work of drafting the peace treaty with Japan was of course entrusted to the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom; it is generally known that these countries are the signatories of the Japanese surrender document. As early as 1947, the Soviet government suggested convening a special meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers composed of representatives from China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom in order to begin preparing for the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet proposal advocated that all countries that participated in the war against Japan with troops should participate in the preparation of drafting the peace treaty with Japan. However, this proposal, like the Soviet government's repeated efforts to expedite the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, did not yield positive results, because the US government ignored the necessity of convening a meeting of foreign ministers to prepare for the peace treaty with Japan and a peace conference to discuss this treaty.
　　The Soviet government believes it is necessary to particularly point out that it is impermissible to exclude China from the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. Everyone knows that China suffered years of brutal aggression by militarist Japan, waged a long and arduous war against Japanese imperialism, and suffered enormous losses as a result of Japanese aggression. Therefore, it is natural that the sole legal representative of the Chinese people—the government of the People's Republic of China—is particularly concerned about drafting the peace treaty with Japan and establishing lasting peace in the Far East. It is quite obvious that without the participation of the People's Republic of China in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, there can be no genuine peace in the Far East.
　　From the above circumstances, it is clear that the US government wants to exclude the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries from participating in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, and to handle it single-handedly, so that it can act arbitrarily and unilaterally force Japan to accept the terms that the US government pleases, while taking advantage of the dependence of the current Japanese government on the US occupation authorities to achieve this goal.

　　(II) Secondly, the Soviet government believes that, from the essence of the
　　problem, the US draft peace treaty contains many incorrect clauses that are incompatible with existing agreements between countries.
　　Regarding the future peace treaty with Japan, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and the Soviet Union undertook clear obligations in the famous international documents of the 1943 Cairo Declaration, the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, and the 1945 Yalta Agreement.
　　These documents stipulate the boundaries of Japanese territory and point out that Japan must "establish a peaceful and responsible government in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people," and then the occupying forces should withdraw from Japan.
　　These documents, as well as agreements signed by countries later, declared that Japan must eliminate "all obstacles that prevent the revival and strengthening of the democratic trends of the Japanese people" and should allow the peaceful economic development of Japan to have broad opportunities.
　　These documents and agreements also pointed out the need to permanently eliminate the authority and influence of the militarists and to eliminate Japanese militarism. The US draft peace treaty more or less ignores these obligations undertaken by countries in the above-mentioned documents.
　　This is the case first of all on the issue of territory.
　　For example, the 1943 Cairo Declaration clearly stipulates that Taiwan Island and the Penghu Islands must be returned to China. However, the US draft only states that Japan renounces all rights to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but does not mention the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China. Therefore, it can be concluded that the draft peace treaty does not change the current status of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which were seized from China, which violates the agreement in the Cairo Declaration on returning these islands to China.
　　The US draft also stipulates that Japan's sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, Rosario Island, the Volcano Islands, Parece Vela and Marcus Island be revoked, and under the pretext of so-called trusteeship by the United Nations over these islands, they are placed under the jurisdiction of the United States. However, there are no provisions in the agreements between countries and the resolutions of the United Nations, represented by the Security Council, for the cession of the above-mentioned islands of Japan, and therefore this robbery is unjustified.
　　More importantly, the US draft peace treaty violates the above-mentioned international agreements on military issues. The US draft not only does not guarantee the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism, but also does not impose any restrictions on the Japanese army. It is enough to point out this point clearly.
　　Everyone knows that Italy and Japan were the main aggressors in World War II, but the peace treaty with Italy clearly limited the number of Italian land forces and navy and air force personnel. However, the US draft peace treaty does not have any restrictions on the Japanese army. Therefore, compared with Italy, Japan is in a privileged position, although there is no basis for this. From this, it can be seen that Japan will be able to decide for itself how many troops it needs to carry out so-called "self-defense." The Soviet government believes that this is tantamount to allowing the revival of Japanese militarism. Naturally, this situation is absolutely incompatible with the well-known agreements of various countries on eliminating Japanese militarism.
　　In addition, there is a fact that cannot be ignored, that is, the US draft peace treaty does not stipulate the date of the withdrawal of the occupation forces from Japan. The direct purpose of the draft is to allow the US occupation forces to continue to be stationed in Japan after the conclusion of the peace treaty and retain military bases. Therefore, even after the "peace" with Japan currently being prepared by the United States, the military occupation of Japan will still not end, and the United States will still be the real master of Japan.
　　It is generally known that the peace treaty with Italy stipulates that the occupation forces should withdraw from Italy within three months after the conclusion of the treaty. Therefore, compared with Italy, Japan is in a worse situation than Italy, and the United States has unlimited rights to continue to occupy Japan indefinitely after signing the peace treaty with Japan. Naturally, all of this is absolutely incompatible with the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation.
　　It should also be pointed out that the US government is already using the occupation of Japan by the US military to achieve goals that are not agreed upon by the signatories of the Japanese surrender document. The US occupation forces stationed in Japan are using Japan's territory, materials, and manpower to carry out armed intervention in Korea, which is incompatible with international agreements, because the international agreements granted the US military the right to occupy Japan only to eliminate Japanese militarism and implement the democratic transformation of Japan.
　　Finally, the US draft peace treaty ignores the need to remove restrictions on the free development of Japan's peaceful economy. Everyone knows that if Japan's peaceful economy cannot develop, and if Japan cannot conduct normal trade with other countries, it will not be possible to lay a solid foundation for the progress of the Japanese economy and the improvement of the welfare of the Japanese people.
　　The Soviet government has some other opinions on the draft peace treaty, and the Soviet government hopes to raise these opinions at the meetings of the relevant countries.
　　The Soviet government has always insisted on concluding a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, believing that the drafting of the treaty must be based on the international agreements signed by various countries during World War II, and that the draft peace treaty must be jointly prepared by representatives of the United States, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and that all members of the Far Eastern Commission should participate.
　　Based on this, the Soviet government proposes:
　　(1) To convene a meeting of foreign ministers organized by representatives from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union in June or July 1951 to begin preparing for the peace treaty with Japan, and consideration should be given to allowing representatives from all countries that participated in the war against Japan with force to participate in the preparation of drafting the peace treaty with Japan, so that the draft peace treaty can be submitted to the peace conference for review.
　　(2) The work of drafting the peace treaty with Japan should be carried out in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, and should be guided by the following main objectives: A. Japan should become a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country; B. The democratic rights of the Japanese people should be guaranteed, and the existence of political, military, or militarized organizations aimed at depriving the people of their democratic rights should not be allowed, as stipulated in the peace treaty with Italy; C. In order to ensure that Japanese militarism is not revived, the treaty should determine the limitations on the size of the Japanese armed forces, so that these armed forces do not exceed the requirements of self-defense, as stipulated in the peace treaty with Italy; D. No restrictions should be imposed on the development of Japan's peaceful economy; E. All restrictions should be removed on Japan's trade relations with other countries.
　　(3) The treaty should stipulate that Japan shall not participate in any alliance against any country that participated in the war against militarist Japan with troops.
　　(4) The treaty should clearly stipulate that all occupation forces should withdraw from Japanese territory within one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, and foreign countries shall not retain troops or bases in Japan.
　　(5) It should be agreed that the countries that sign the peace treaty with Japan support Japan's participation in the United Nations.
　　Moscow, May 7, 1951"
　　Copies of the above documents have been simultaneously sent to the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, France, India, Pakistan, Burma, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

### 谴责美国对日和约草案单独媾和阴谋  苏联提出对日和约五项建议  主张召开中苏英美四国外长会议开始和约准备工作

　　谴责美国对日和约草案单独媾和阴谋
    苏联提出对日和约五项建议
    主张召开中苏英美四国外长会议开始和约准备工作
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：今年五月七日，苏联副外交部长波格莫洛夫将“苏联关于美国对日和约草案的意见书”一份交给美国驻苏联大使寇克先生。
    意见书全文如下：
    “今年三月二十九日，苏联政府收到美国政府送来的对日和约草案。关于这件事，苏联政府认为有必要表示以下的意见：
    虽然对日战争结束已经五年多，但对日媾和的问题仍未解决。这种情形的造成，首先是由于美国政府的态度，美国政府用各种各样的借口不仅仅拖延和约的缔结，而且甚至拖延和约的准备。美国政府曾因此屡次拒绝苏联政府所提出的依照各该有关的国际协定的规定与其他国家的政府共同准备对日和约的建议。结果，就延长了外国军队占领日本的时间，这是不能容许的。
            （一）苏联政府的意见首先要谈的是对日和约的准备工作不正确。
    美国政府随着美国的对日和约草案附来一份备忘录，其中说：该草案是美国政府的代表与其他若干国家的政府，包括苏联政府的代表交换意见之后拟成的。应该指出，这种说法是不正确的，因为苏联政府早在今年三月初就曾发表声明，拒绝与美国代表进行单独的准备对日和约谈判。苏联政府之所以拒绝进行单独的谈判是从这样的前提出发的，就是：准备对日和约不能是某一国政府的事情，或由它征询其他有关国家政府的意见，而必须是所有这些国家共同的事情，因为这是各该有关国际协定所规定了的。然而美国政府并没有放弃单独进行对日和约的准备工作，而是竭力独揽这种权利，这就违反了它在与苏联、中国和英国共同进行并由其他有关国家参加准备对日和约方面所承担的义务。
    依照一九四五年八月二日的波茨坦协定的规定，美、苏、中、英、法五国外长会议业已成立，波茨坦协定明白规定，外长会议的建立首先是为了“和约的准备工作”，在草拟各个和约时，“会议将由在有关敌国投降书上签字之会员国组成之”。对意大利、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和芬兰的和约，就是依照这一规定而准备与签订的。根据上述波茨坦协定，拟订对日和约的工作当然是已经委托给美国、苏联、中国和英国；一般都知道，这几个国家是日本投降书的签字国。早在一九四七年，苏联政府就曾建议召开由中国、美国、苏联及英国的代表组成的外长会议的特别会议，以便开始进行对日和约的准备工作。苏联的建议主张所有曾以军队参加对日作战的国家都参加草拟对日和约的准备工作。但是这个建议，也象苏联政府历次为加速缔结对日和约所一再作过的努力一样，没有得到积极的结果，因为美国政府忽视召开准备对日和约的外长会议和讨论这个和约的和会的必要性。
    苏联政府认为必须特别指出：不让中国参加对日和约的准备工作，是不能容许的。大家知道，中国会受军国主义日本多年的残酷侵略，曾对日本帝国主义进行长期的艰苦战争，并因日本的侵略而受到巨大的损失。因此，中国人民唯一的合法代表——中华人民共和国政府特别关心拟订对日和约与建立远东的持久和平，是很自然的。十分明显，如果没有中华人民共和国参加对日和约的准备工作，在远东就不可能有真正的媾和。
    从上述情形看来，美国政府显然是想撇开苏联、中华人民共和国和其他国家，不要它们参加对日和约的准备工作，而由它自己一手包办，以便独断独行，片面地强使日本接受美国政府随心所欲的条款，同时利用日本现政府对美国占领当局的依赖性来达到这个目的。
            （二）其次，苏联政府认为：从问题的实质来看，美国的对日和
        约草案中包含着许多与各国间现有的协定不相容的不正确的条款。
    关于将来的对日和约，美国、英国、中国和苏联四国政府曾在一九四三年的开罗宣言、一九四五年的波茨坦公告和一九四五年的雅尔塔协定这些著名的国际文件中承担了明确的义务。
    这些文件规定了日本领土的疆界，并指出日本必须“依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府”，然后占领军队即应撤出日本。
    这些文件以及各国以后所签订的协定都声明：日本必须消除“阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍”，并应使日本和平经济的发展得有广泛的机会。
    这些文件和协定同时又指出有必要永久清除军国主义者的威权及势力并肃清日本的军国主义。美国的对日和约草案或多或少忽视了各国在上述各项文件中所承担的这些义务。
    首先在领土问题上，情形就是如此。
    例如，一九四三年的开罗宣言明白规定：台湾岛和澎湖列岛必须归还中国。但是美国草案仅仅说日本放弃对台湾和澎湖列岛的一切权利，而对于把台湾和澎湖列岛交还中国却只字未提。因此可以得出结论，和约草案毫未改变是从中国抢去的台湾和澎湖列岛目前的地位，这是违反开罗宣言中关于把这些岛屿归还中国的协议的。
    美国草案还规定取消日本对琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、罗萨里奥岛、火山群岛、巴列斯维拉岛和马尔库斯岛的主权，并假借所谓由联合国对这些岛屿实行托管作为口实，把它们交由美国管辖。但是，各国间的协定和以安全理事会为代表的联合国的决议都没有规定割去日本的上述岛屿，因此这种劫夺是毫无理由的。
    更为重要的是美国的对日和约草案在军事问题上违背了上述国际协定。美国草案中不仅没有保证防止日本军国主义复活，而且完全没有对日本的军队作任何限制。只要指出这一点就足够清楚了。
    大家都知道，意大利与日本同为第二次世界大战的主要侵略者，但对意和约明确地限制了意大利的陆军部队和海军、空军的人数。然而美国的对日和约草案中对日本军队却没有任何限制。因此，与意大利比较起来，日本处于一种特权的地位，虽然这是没有任何根据的。由此可见，日本将可以自行决定为进行所谓“自卫”需要多少军队。苏联政府认为这等于允许日本的军国主义复活。自然，这种情形是与大家所熟知的各国关于肃清日本军国主义的协定绝不相容的。
    此外，还有一件事实不容忽视，这就是美国的和约草案没有规定占领军撤出日本的日期，草案的直接目的就是使美国占领军在缔结和约以后继续留驻日本并保有军事基地。因此，甚至在美国目前所准备的对日“媾和”之后，对日本的军事占领仍旧不会结束，而美国依然是日本真正的主宰。
    一般都知道，对意和约规定占领军在和约缔结之后三个月内撤出意大利。因此，与意大利比较起来，日本的处境要比意大利更坏，而美国却有了无限的权利可以在签订对日和约以后继续无限期地占领日本。自然，所有这一切是与一九四五年的波茨坦公告绝不相容的。
    还应当指出，美国政府现在就已经在利用美军的占领日本，来达到并不是日本投降书各签字国所同意的目的。美国驻日占领军正在利用日本的领土、物力与人力对朝鲜实行武装干涉，这是和国际协定不相容的，因为国际协定之所以给美国军队以占领日本的权利，只是为了肃清日本的军国主义与实施日本的民主改造。
    最后，美国对日和约草案忽视了取消对日本和平经济自由发展的限制的必要性。大家都知道，假若日本的和平经济不能发展，假若日本和别的国家不能进行正常的贸易，就不可能为日本经济的进步与日本人民福利的提高奠定巩固的基础。
    苏联政府对于和约草案还有一些其他的意见，苏联政府希望把这些意见在有关国家的会议上提出来。
    苏联政府曾经始终坚持尽速缔结对日和约，认为和约的起草必须根据各国在第二次世界大战期间所订的国际协定，和约草案必须由美国、中华人民共和国、苏联与英国四国的代表共同准备，并使远东委员会所有的会员国参加。
    根据这一点，苏联政府提议：
    （一）在一九五一年六月或七月，召开美、中、英、苏四国代表组织的外长会议，着手筹备对日和约，并应顾及使所有曾以武力参加对日战争之各国代表参与制定对日和约的筹备工作，以便将和约草案提交和会审议之。
    （二）草拟对日和约的工作应根据开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔塔协定进行，并以下列主要目的为指导方针：甲、日本应成为爱好和平的、民主的、独立的国家；乙、应保证日本人民的民主权利，并不得允许以剥夺人民民主权利为目的的，无论是政治的、军事的或军事化的组织之存在，与对意大利和约中所规定者相同；丙、为保证日本军国主义之不复活，在条约内应确定对日本武装力量规模之限制，使此等武装力量不超越自卫之要求。与在对意大利和约中所规定者相同；丁、对日本和平经济之发展，不应加以任何限制；戊、在日本和其他国家的贸易关系上，应取消一切限制。
    （三）条约应规定：日本不得参加任何反对任一会以军队参加对军国主义日本作战的国家的联盟。
    （四）条约应明确规定：在缔结对日和约以后一年之内，一切占领军应撤出日本领土，外国不得在日本保有军队或基地。
    （五）应一致同意，在对日和约上签字的国家支持日本参加联合国。
                            一九五一年五月七日于莫斯科”
    上述文件的副本已同时送交中华人民共和国、英国、法国、印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、澳大利亚、加拿大、新西兰、荷兰、蒙古人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
