　　The agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet was signed on May 23, 1951. This is the cornerstone for the Tibetan people to forever break away from imperialist aggression and bondage, return to the big family of friendly cooperation among all nationalities of the People's Republic of China, fully enjoy national equality and regional autonomy rights, develop political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings, and improve the people's lives. It is also the first step for the Tibetan people to move from darkness and suffering to light and happiness. This is a great victory for the Tibetan people, and also a victory for all the Chinese people.

　　For over a hundred years, imperialism invaded China and also invaded Tibet. As early as the second half of the 18th century, British imperialism began to invade this region of ours. After World War II, American imperialism also intervened. With the victorious development of the Chinese People's Revolution and the People's Liberation War, imperialism and its running dogs became even more rabid and arrogant, hastily fabricating the so-called "Tibetan independence" and various "anti-communist" schemes, attempting to completely separate the Tibetan nationality and people from the motherland, completely lose their independence and freedom, and completely become their slaves. As early as September 2, 1949, Xinhua News Agency warned them that Tibet and Taiwan are both inseparable parts of Chinese territory, "Any aggressor... if he dares to妄想分割和侵略Tibet and Taiwan, he will surely be血流满面before the iron fist of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army." But imperialism and its running dogs have not repented in the slightest. They attempted to organize armed intervention in Tibet as capital for creating a third world war. When the Central People's Government notified the Tibetan Local Government to send representatives to the Central Government for negotiations on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they did everything possible to obstruct and undermine it. Now, these conspiracies cannot but be declared bankrupt. The signing of the agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet has already declared their conspiracies bankrupt. The Chinese people are resolutely opposed to imperialism. We do not invade any country and strive to live in peace with neighboring countries. Article 14 of the agreement has solemnly declared: "On the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, to live in peace with neighboring countries and establish and develop fair trade relations." But if the imperialists do not finally abandon their conspiracy to invade Tibet, if they still want to undermine and obstruct the implementation of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, then the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, will surely make them continue to suffer defeat.

　　The Tibetan nationality is one of the nationalities with a long history within China and is one of many excellent nationalities, having fulfilled a glorious responsibility in the creation and development of the great motherland. However, for a long historical period, the Tibetan nationality was under the oppression of the reactionary governments of the Han and Manchu nationalities. The Manchu Qing government, the Beiyang warlord government, and the Kuomintang government were the most vicious representatives of national oppression. From the Manchu Qing government to the Kuomintang government, the reactionary rulers of China, on the one hand, succumbed to imperialist aggression, and on the other hand, cruelly oppressed and exploited the people of all minority nationalities in China. Under the internal oppression of these reactionary governments and the external pressure of imperialist aggressive forces, the political, economic, and cultural development of the Tibetan nationality stagnated and declined for a long time, while the people's lives became increasingly poor and painful. The Manchu Qing government, the Beiyang warlord government, and the Kuomintang government all adopted the means of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to provoke and divide the various parts of the Tibetan nationality to achieve their goals of national oppression. Imperialism, on the other hand, took advantage of the Tibetan people's hatred for the Manchu Qing government, the Beiyang warlord government, and the Kuomintang government to cultivate separatists among the Tibetan people, namely "Tibetan independence" advocates, to achieve their goals of aggression. Some members of the upper class among the Tibetan people, because they could not distinguish between the people of the motherland and the reactionary government of the motherland, and because they could not recognize the conspiracy of imperialism, have been mired in the quagmire of unpatriotic ideas for a long time. However, this is not the responsibility of the entire Tibetan nationality and the vast majority of Tibetan monks and laypeople. The Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people not only carried out many heroic struggles against the Manchu Qing government and the Kuomintang government, but also carried out many heroic struggles against imperialist aggressive forces, and thus against the pro-imperialist forces within Tibet. It is precisely for this reason that the Tibetan nationality was able to avoid extinction in the face of long-term domestic reactionary oppression and foreign aggressive forces, and instead demonstrated that it is an indomitable nationality. It is precisely for this reason that when the common internal enemy of all nationalities in China, the Kuomintang government, had been overthrown, and the common external enemy, the imperialist aggressive forces, had been driven out of China, when the People's Republic of China had been established, and the Central People's Government had formally announced the abolition of national oppression and the implementation of a policy of national equality, and the People's Liberation Army victoriously entered the Qamdo area and earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great national policy in those areas, the patriotism that had been suppressed for a long time among the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people quickly rose and grew. During this period, the Tenth Panchen Erdeni first expressed his support for the Central People's Government a year and a half ago; on the day that the Fourteenth Dalai Lama took power, he immediately began to change the previous erroneous policies of the Tibetan government, accepted the call of the Central People's Government for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and sent a delegation to the Central Government to hold negotiations. It is precisely these circumstances and reasons that throughout the entire negotiation process, the Central People's Government must require the Tibetan Local Government to resolutely break away from imperialist shackles, actively assist the People's Liberation Army to enter the Tibetan region to protect the unity of China's territorial sovereignty, and to remove the obstacles to the Tibetan nationality enjoying national equality and national regional autonomy rights, because this is the established policy of the People's Republic of China for all nationalities in the country that must be thoroughly implemented. But on the other hand, the Central People's Government, in dealing with the internal affairs of Tibet, has adopted extremely lenient measures based on the established national policy of the Central Government and the actual conditions in the Tibetan region, such as the expenses of the People's Liberation Army and staff entering the Tibetan region being entirely supplied by the Central Government and not borne by the local government; the Central Government not changing the existing political system in the Tibetan region or the position and powers of the Dalai Lama; the freedom of religious belief of the Tibetan people being not only fully guaranteed, but also the income of the temples not being changed by the Central Government, and so on. All of this has been clearly stipulated in the agreement.

　　All nationalities should fully enjoy and exercise their rights of national regional autonomy in order to realize political equality among all nationalities; all nationalities should develop their economic and cultural education in order to gradually eliminate the factual inequality among all nationalities caused by long-term history and gradually realize complete equality among all nationalities. In order to achieve political equality, and even gradually achieve economic and cultural equality, it is inevitable that internal reforms suited to the development of each nationality need to be carried out step by step. This general law also applies to the Tibetan nationality. Therefore, the agreement takes a positive attitude towards the internal reform affairs of Tibet, but at the same time, it points out that the Central Government will not force it, while the Tibetan Local Government should take the initiative to carry out reforms; when the people raise reform requirements, they can be resolved through consultation with the leaders. This is a provision that is fully in line with the spirit of the Central Government's national policy and the actual needs of the Tibetan nationality. The Central Government's policy is not only like this for Tibet, but also for all minority brother nationalities in the country. Because the reform of inherent systems such as politics, economy, culture, and religion, as well as the reform of customs and habits, if it is not carried out consciously and voluntarily by the people of all nationalities and the leaders who are connected with the people, but is carried out forcibly by orders from the Central People's Government, or is carried out rigidly and forcibly by staff members from the Han nationality or other nationalities, it will only arouse national resentment and fail to achieve the purpose of reform.

　　Internal unity among the Tibetan nationality is an important factor in the forward development of the Tibetan nationality. In the past, due to the provocations of imperialist aggressive forces and the reactionary government of China, the internal divisions of the Tibetan nationality occurred for a long time, which was mainly manifested in the hatred and opposition between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. In order to realize the wishes of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, the Central People's Government has tried its best to persuade both sides to abandon their old evils and reunite anew. The solution stipulated in the agreement is completely fair and reasonable. It is hoped that the personnel from both the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni will sincerely understand and implement this aspect of the agreement, unite forever, and work hard to build a new Tibet.

　　Among the Tibetan people, Buddhism has a very high prestige. The people's belief in the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni is very high. Therefore, the agreement not only stipulates that religion should be respected and temples should be protected, but also that the status and powers of the above-mentioned two leaders of the Tibetan people should be respected. This is not only to reconcile the previously disharmonious parties within the Tibetan nationality, but also to cause all nationalities in the country to have the necessary respect for the Tibetan leaders.

　　In order to ensure the correct implementation of the entire agreement, the agreement stipulates that the Central People's Government shall establish a Military and Political Committee and a Military Region Headquarters in the Tibetan region, with the participation of local Tibetan personnel, as representative organs of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government. The Military and Political Committee will represent the Central People's Government and guide the implementation of the entire agreement in accordance with the specific conditions of Tibet. The Military Region Headquarters will take on the responsibility of unified leadership and command of all armed forces in the Tibetan region in order to defend national defense, stabilize internal order, and gradually reorganize the Tibetan local army into the People's Liberation Army in order to enhance the national defense and public security forces in the Tibetan region.

　　The problem now is that the Tibetan Local Government must responsibly and earnestly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. On this issue, we fully agree with the attitude expressed by the chief representative of the Tibetan Local Government in his speech after signing the agreement. The Tibetan Local Government must first take serious steps to assist the People's Liberation Army in peacefully entering Tibet, and prepare all necessary conditions for the advance of the People's Liberation Army, such as politically publicizing the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet to the monks and laypeople and making necessary explanations; and materially helping the People's Liberation Army purchase and transport grain and fodder. In order to smoothly carry out these preparatory tasks, the Tibetan Local Government must be vigilant against the sabotage of imperialist elements and Kuomintang special agents, and be determined to defeat any of their conspiracies. We believe that the Tibetan Local Government, under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, will certainly be able to fulfill its due responsibilities.

　　There may still be some people in the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan Local Government who harbor doubts and concerns about the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. This doubt and concern is understandable and not surprising. This is the result of the long-term national estrangement caused by the reactionary government of China and imperialist aggressive forces in history. It must be eliminated through proof of facts, that is, through the practice of the national equality policy in the Tibetan region, after a considerable period of time. It is precisely for this reason that all troops and local staff entering the Tibetan region must adhere to the national policy and religious policy, must adhere to the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, must strictly abide by discipline, must implement fair trade that is carried out completely in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, must prevent and correct great-Han chauvinism tendencies, and eliminate this large national estrangement left over from history with their sincere respect for the Tibetan nationality and their practice of serving the Tibetan people, and win the sincere trust of the Tibetan Local Government and the Tibetan people. If there are any violations of national policy and agreement by these troops and staff, if they do not abide by discipline, if they bully the Tibetan people and do not respect the leaders who are connected with the people, if they commit the fundamental error of great-Han chauvinism, then the leading organs and leading personnel shall be responsible for timely correction. At the same time, the Tibetan Local Government and the Tibetan people have the right to criticize and the right to reflect and report to the higher-level People's Government and the Central People's Government. This principle applies not only to the Tibetan nationality, but also to all brother nationalities.

　　The signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet has brought epoch-making changes to the history of the Tibetan nationality and the history of the relationship between the Tibetan nationality and the motherland, and has brought a bright and happy future to the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people. We warmly congratulate the peaceful liberation of the Tibetan nationality and congratulate the bright and happy future of the Tibetan nationality.

　　Long live the great unity of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Central People's Government!

　　Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China!

### 拥护关于和平解放西藏办法的协议

　　拥护关于和平解放西藏办法的协议
    中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，已于一九五一年五月二十三日签字了。这是西藏民族永远脱离帝国主义的侵略和羁绊，回到中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作大家庭来，充分享受民族平等和区域自治权利，发展政治、经济、文化教育事业，改善人民生活的基石，亦即是西藏人民从黑暗和痛苦走向光明和幸福的第一步。这是藏族人民的伟大胜利，亦即是全中国人民的胜利。
    百多年以来，帝国主义侵入中国，同时也侵入西藏。远在十八世纪后半期，英帝国主义就开始侵入我们这块地方，第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义又插了进来。随着中国人民大革命和人民解放战争的胜利发展，帝国主义及其走狗更加像疯狗一般地狂妄起来，慌忙制造所谓“西藏独立”和种种“反共”勾当，企图使西藏民族和人民完全脱离祖国，完全丧失独立自由，完全成为他们的奴隶。新华社远在一九四九年九月二日就警告他们说，西藏和台湾都是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，“任何侵略者……如果敢于妄想分割和侵略西藏和台湾，他就一定要在伟大的中国人民解放军的铁拳之前碰得头破血流。”但是帝国主义及其走狗并没有丝毫悔改，他们企图在西藏这块地方组织武装干涉，作为制造第三次世界大战的资本。当着中央人民政府通知西藏地方政府派遣代表到中央来进行和平解放西藏谈判以后，更千方百计加以阻挠和破坏。现在，这些阴谋不能不宣告破产了。中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的签订，已经使他们的阴谋宣告破产了。中国人民是坚决反对帝国主义的。我们不侵略任何国家，并且力求与邻国和平相处。协议的第十四条已经严正地申明：“在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上，与邻邦和平相处，建立和发展公平的通商贸易关系。”但是帝国主义者如果不最后地放弃侵略西藏的阴谋，如果仍然要破坏和阻挠和平解放西藏办法的协议的执行，那么，中国人民包含西藏人民在内就一定要使他们继续遭受失败。
    西藏民族是中国境内具有悠久历史的民族之一，并且是许多优秀民族中的一个，在伟大祖国的创造发展中曾尽了光荣的责任。但在很长的历史时期中，西藏民族却处于汉族和满族的反动政府压迫之下，满清政府、北洋军阀政府和国民党政府更是民族压迫的最凶恶的代表。从满清政府至国民党政府，中国的反动统治者，一方面屈服于帝国主义的侵略，另方面则残暴地压迫和剥削全中国各少数民族的人民。在内受这些反动政府压迫和外受帝国主义侵略势力压迫之下，西藏民族的政治、经济和文化长期地陷于停滞衰退的境况，而人民生活则愈来愈贫穷愈痛苦。满清政府、北洋军阀政府和国民党政府都采取“以夷制夷”的手段，挑拨和分裂藏族的各部分，以达其民族压迫的目的。帝国主义则利用藏族对于满清政府、北洋军阀政府和国民党政府的仇恨情绪，培植藏族中的分离主义者，即“西藏独立”主义者，以达其侵略目的。藏族中的一部分上层分子，由于不能分清祖国人民与祖国的反动政府，又由于不能认识帝国主义的阴谋，以致长期地陷入非爱国主义的泥坑。然而这不是整个西藏民族和绝大多数西藏僧、俗人民所应该负责的。西藏民族和西藏人民不仅对于满清政府和国民党政府进行过多次的英勇斗争，而且对于帝国主义侵略势力，从而对于西藏内部的亲帝国主义势力，也进行过多次的英勇斗争。正是这个原故，西藏民族才能在长期的国内反动压迫和国外侵略势力面前，得以免于灭亡，相反地表现出是一个不可屈服的民族。正是这个原故，当国内各民族共同的内部敌人国民党政府已被打倒，共同的外部敌人帝国主义侵略势力已被驱逐出中国，当中华人民共和国已经成立，中央人民政府正式宣告废除民族压迫，实行民族平等政策，而人民解放军胜利地进入昌都一带地区，并在那些地区认真地实行毛主席的伟大民族政策的时候，西藏民族和西藏人民中长期被抑压着的爱国主义即迅速地昂扬增长起来。在此期间，班禅额尔德尼十世已于一年半以前首先表示拥护中央人民政府；达赖喇嘛十四世亲政之日，又即开始改变以往西藏政府的错误政策，接受中央人民政府和平解放西藏的号召，派遣代表团来中央举行谈判。正是上述这些情况和原故，在整个谈判过程中，中央人民政府必须要求西藏地方政府坚决摆脱帝国主义羁绊，积极协助人民解放军开入西藏地区，以保护中国领土主权的统一，以清除西藏民族享受民族平等和民族区域自治权利的障碍，因为这是中华人民共和国对国内一切民族所既定的必须加以彻底实现的方针。但另方面，中央人民政府对于西藏内部事务的处理，则本中央既定的民族政策和西藏地区的实际情况，采取了极为宽大的办法，如进入西藏地区的人民解放军和工作人员的经费，一律由中央供给，不要地方负担；如对于西藏地方的现行政治制度及达赖喇嘛的地位和职权，中央不予变更；如西藏人民的宗教信仰自由不但受到充分保证，而且寺庙的收入，中央亦不予变更，等等。凡此都在协议中作了明确的规定。
    一切民族皆应充分享受和实行其民族区域自治的权利，才能实现各民族间的政治平等；一切民族皆应发展其经济和文化教育的事业，才能逐步消灭长期历史上造成的各民族间的事实上的不平等，逐步实现各民族间的完全的平等。为要实现政治上的平等，以至逐步实现经济和文化上的平等，则各民族内部不可避免地需要有步骤地实行适合于本民族发展情况的改革。这个一般的规律，同样适用于西藏民族。因此在协议条文中对于西藏的内部改革事宜，采取了肯定的态度，但同时指明中央不予强迫进行，而西藏地方政府则应当主动地进行改革；人民提出改革要求时，则可以采取与领导人员协商的方式加以解决。这是完全符合于中央民族政策精神和西藏民族实际需要的规定。中央的这个政策，不但对西藏是如此，对国内一切占少数的兄弟民族都是如此。因为政治、经济、文化、宗教等项固有制度的改革以及风俗习惯的改革，如果不是出于各民族人民以及和人民有联系的领袖们自觉自愿地去进行，而由中央人民政府下命令强迫地去进行，而由汉族或他族人民中出身的工作人员生硬地强制地去进行，那就只会引起民族反感，达不到改革的目的。
    西藏民族内部团结起来，是西藏民族向前发展的重要因素。过去由于帝国主义侵略势力和中国反动政府的挑拨，使西藏民族的内部长期地发生了分裂，这主要表现在达赖喇嘛和斑禅额尔德尼间的仇视和对立。中央人民政府为了实现西藏僧、俗人民的愿望，极力说服双方捐弃旧恶，从新团结起来。协议中所规定的解决办法，是完全公平的合理的。希望达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼两方面的人员，衷心地理解和实现这个方面的协议，永远地团结起来，为建设新的西藏而努力。
    在西藏人民中，佛教有很高的威信。人民对达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的信仰是很高的。因此，协议中不但规定对宗教应予尊重，对寺庙应予保护，而且对上述两位藏族人民的领袖的地位和职权也应予以尊重。这不但是为和解藏族内部过去不和睦的双方，也为使国内各民族对藏族领袖引起必要的尊重。
    为保证全部协议的正确实行，协议中规定中央人民政府在西藏地区设立有西藏地方人员参加的军政委员会和军区司令部，作为中央人民政府和中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的代表机关。军政委员会将代表中央人民政府并依据西藏具体情况，以指导全部协议之执行。军区司令部则负起统一领导和指挥西藏地区一切武装部队的责任，以保卫国防，安定内部秩序，并逐步改编西藏地方军队为人民解放军，以增强西藏地区的国防力量和公安力量。
    现在的问题是西藏地方政府要负责地认真地执行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。在这个问题上，我们完全赞成西藏地方政府首席代表在签字后讲话时所表示的态度。西藏地方政府首先要采取认真的步骤来协助人民解放军和平开进西藏，为人民解放军的进军准备一切必要的条件，例如政治上将关于和平解放西藏办法的协议公布于僧、俗人民，并作必要的解释；在物质上帮助人民解放军购买运输粮秣等。为着顺利地进行这些准备工作，西藏地方必须警惕帝国主义分子和国民党特务分子的破坏，并决心击破其任何阴谋。我们相信西藏地方政府在达赖喇嘛的领导下，一定能够履行自己应该履行的责任。
    西藏民族和西藏地方政府中可能有一些人对中央人民政府和人民解放军仍然存着怀疑和顾虑，这种怀疑和顾虑是有原因的，是不足为怪的。这是因为历史上中国反动政府和帝国主义侵略势力长期造成的民族隔阂的结果，必须靠事实的证明，即靠民族平等政策在西藏地区的实践，经过一个相当的时间，才能加以消除的。正因为这个原故，一切进入西藏地区的部队人员和地方工作人员必须恪守民族政策和宗教政策，必须恪守和平解放西藏办法的协议，必须严守纪律，必须实行公平的即完全按照等价交换原则去进行的贸易，必须防止和纠正大民族主义倾向，而以自己的衷心尊重西藏民族和为西藏人民服务的实践，来消除这个历史上留下来的很大的民族隔阂，取得西藏地方政府和西藏人民的衷心信任。如果这些部队和工作人员中有违反民族政策和协议的行为，如果他们不守纪律，如果他们欺负西藏人民和不尊重与人民有联系的领袖人物，如果他们犯了大汉族主义的原则错误，那么领导机关和领导人员就应负责及时纠正。同时，西藏地方政府和西藏人民则有批评的权利和向上级人民政府和中央人民政府反映和报告的权利。这个原则，不但对藏族是如此，对一切兄弟民族都是如此。
    关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的签订，给与西藏民族的历史以及西藏民族与祖国的关系的历史，带来了划时期的变化，给与西藏民族和西藏人民带来了光明和幸福的前途。我们热烈地祝贺西藏民族的和平解放，祝贺西藏民族的光明和幸福的前途。
    中华人民共和国各民族大团结万岁！
    中央人民政府万岁！
    中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
