　　Message of Respect to the Chinese and Korean People's Armies

　　The entire body of representatives attending the meeting to handle institutions accepting subsidies from American relief organizations sent a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on April 30th. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　Dear Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army Comrades:

　　You have valiantly defeated the American imperialist-led invasion group in defense of the security of the motherland and to seek the liberation of the Korean nation, making supremely glorious contributions to the world's people's struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy. We, the entire body of representatives attending the meeting to handle institutions accepting subsidies from American relief organizations, are more confident, under the encouragement of your victory, in managing China's own relief and welfare undertakings, thoroughly crushing the American imperialist plot to use relief organizations for aggression in China, and supporting you with practical actions in completely liberating Korea.

　　You are bravely fighting at the front, disregarding sacrifice, for the sake of defending the motherland and protecting children and women from the slaughter and humiliation of American imperialism. We in the rear must be determined to take over all the American imperialist institutions that kill infants, enslave children, and abuse the elderly, and take good care of and educate our fellow compatriots who are being aided. We must learn from your fighting spirit to fight against American imperialist elements, eradicate pro-American and worship-America thoughts, and promote the spirit of patriotism, so that we do not betray your painstaking efforts in sacrificing yourselves to love the people of the motherland. We offer our highest regards and respect!
