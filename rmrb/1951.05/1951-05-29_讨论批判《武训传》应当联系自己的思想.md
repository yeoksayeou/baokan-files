　　Discussion and Criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" Should be Linked to One's Own Thinking
To the Editor:
    Some people believe that they have not made any mistakes in the matter of "The Life of Wu Xun," so they do not think it is necessary to connect it with themselves in the discussion. This is wrong. I ask these people (I have seen quite a few) a question: Indeed, you have not stirred up any mistakes, but this does not guarantee that you will not stir up any mistakes; when the People's Daily had not yet raised this issue, when you were surrounded by countless incorrect opinions, if someone asked you to express your opinion, are you confident that you can speak clearly and logically, or are you confident that you can recognize those erroneous arguments and refute them?
    The People's Daily editorial listed forty-three problematic articles, some of which were caused by "rushing to complete the task," which exposed the erroneous thoughts of the authors of these articles. Some comrades in this matter simply did not have the opportunity to expose their mistakes in the past. Our discussion with the Wu Xun issue is by no means "irrelevant"!

### 讨论批判《武训传》应当联系自己的思想

　　讨论批判《武训传》应当联系自己的思想编辑同志：
    有些人在《武训传》的问题上自以为个人没有什么错误，因此他们不认为在讨论时有连系自己的必要，这是不对的。我对这些人（我已看到不少）提一个问题：诚然，你不曾搅出什么错误来，但这并不能担保你不会搅出什么错误来；当人民日报还没有把这问题提出来时，当你四周还充满着无数不正确的见解时，如果有人叫你发表意见，你自信能说得头头是道，或者，你自信能认识到那些错误的论点而予以驳斥吗？
    人民日报社论列举了四十三篇有问题的文章，其中有一部分是因为“赶任务”所致，这也就暴露了这些文章的作者的错误思想。有些同志在这个问题上不过是过去没有暴露错误的机会罢了。我们和武训问题的讨论决不是“不相干”的！
