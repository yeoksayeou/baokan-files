    III. "Heavy Rent"
    A popular folk song circulated widely in rural Jiangsu: "Farmers carry two knives on their backs: heavy rent and high interest! Farmers face three paths: drowning, hanging, and jail!" This folk song reflects a reality of blood and tears. "Heavy rent" is the first knife, the first weapon used by landlords for exploitation.

    Land is the farmer's "lifeline." Because without land, farmers cannot engage in production, they cannot survive. However, most of the land is occupied by feudal landlords. Therefore, farmers have no choice but to rent land from the landlord class, paying high rents every year. In the eyes of the farmers, the land must be rented; the rent must be paid, there is absolutely no freedom to choose the second path. The relationship between farmers and landlords is not an ordinary business relationship where one can buy if they agree, and not buy if they disagree. Farmers can never rent land from landlords under agreeable terms, and often find themselves increasingly unable to avoid renting under increasingly disagreeable conditions. Therefore, the tenancy agreements under the feudal land system are 100% one-sided. Only the farmers write receipts for the landlords, guaranteeing to pay "clean and pure rent rice on time, regardless of whether it is a good year, a flood year, or a drought year, with no shortage of liters and measures"; landlords never write any receipts for the farmers. This is an inevitable phenomenon under the feudal land system. In this way, the first knife is thrust into the backs of the farmers.

    The general situation across the country is that farmers have to hand over half of their total annual harvest to the landlords. Jiangsu is no exception. Farmers in Wu County say: "Three out of six rice plants have to be given to the landlord." Given the current level of productivity, this rent is unbearable for the farmers. For example, in Qiangjiaqiao, Meicun District, Wuxi, the average production cost for a farmer cultivating one mu of land is 7.5 dou of rice, and the living cost is 5.6 dou, while the total annual normal production income is 2.2 dan, leaving only 8.9 dou after offsetting the expenses. However, 50% of the produce must be handed over as rent, which is 1.1 dan. This results in a shortfall of 2.1 dou. Where does one make up for this deficit? There is no other way except to reduce the necessary living expenses from 5.6 dou to 3.5 dou. This means that this level of rent exploitation not only seizes all of the farmer's surplus labor, but also encroaches on 40% of the farmer's necessary labor.

    However, the above-mentioned 50% rent is only the so-called "standard rent." In Jiangsu, there are also cases where the "standard rent" exceeds 50%. For example, the "jiaose tian" prevalent in Jiading and Baoshan areas accounts for about 75% of the annual output. But let's set this aside for the moment. Even with the "standard rent" that generally accounts for 50% of the output, the amount of rent paid by the farmers is actually much higher due to various clever and vicious extractions by the landlord class. Here are a few ways of extra exploitation:

    "Deposit Rent" and "Advance Rent." In terms of deposit rent, for example, farmers in Fengxian who rent one mu of land must first pay 5 dou to 1.5 dan of rice to the landlord. In Jintan, the deposit rent for one mu is 80 to 100 jin of rice. In Gaoying Township, Changshu, before the Anti-Japanese War, it was 30 to 40 yuan in puppet currency per mu. In Wuxi, some tenant farmers even had to pay 5 dan of rice per mu, the deposit rent was almost equal to the land price. In terms of advance rent, for example, in Nanhui, part of the 1949 rent was paid in 1948, with a minimum of 7.5 dou of rice per mu and a maximum of 1 dan. Deposit rent and advance rent often put farmers in debt, allowing landlords to increase their capital for usury and speculative trading.

    "Surcharges for Late Payment." This method is also very common in Jiangsu. For example, in the Songjiang area, landlords have so-called "three deadlines" for collecting rent each year: the 15th day before the Winter Solstice is the "first deadline," and rent can be paid according to the prescribed amount within the first deadline; the 10th day before the Winter Solstice is the "second deadline," and rent paid within the second deadline is subject to a 10% surcharge on the original amount; the 7th day after the Winter Solstice is the "third deadline" or "final deadline," and rent paid within the deadline is subject to another 10% surcharge. If the rent rice is not paid off after the final deadline, some landlords send many thugs and ruffians to eat and drink at the tenants' homes, demanding everything that can be eaten until the rent rice is forcibly paid off; some landlords collude with the reactionary government to send soldiers to arrest the tenants and drag them into lawsuits.

    "Large Hukou and Large Dou." When we visited the Land Reform Exhibition in Wuxi, we saw a photo of more than 30 large hukou, large dou, and large sheng collected in Yangshe Town, Jiangyin, all used by landlords to collect rent. Among them, Tong Zhaofu's dou was 2 sheng larger than an ordinary dou; Chang Shilong's dou was 1 sheng, 8 he, and 4 shao larger; Miao Gangyu's 2.5-sheng hukou was as large as an ordinary 3-sheng hukou; Guo Fengya's sheng was 3 he larger. At the Wujiang Exhibition, we also saw that landlord Wu Heqing's 5-dou hukou was 1 dou larger than an ordinary one, and female landlord Zhang Aizhen's 5-dou hukou was 5 sheng larger than an ordinary one. At the Changshu Exhibition, it was even seen that landlord Li Yuefu's 5-dou hukou in Liantang District was as much as 6.6 sheng. Therefore, farmers have a folk song: "Seeing the five-dou hukou, the tenant's whole family cries; the calculated five-dou hukou is actually six dou and six!" Li Yuefu collected 1 dan of rent, which was equivalent to collecting 1 dan and 3.2 sheng. We dare not guarantee that there are no other records in the large hukou and large dou that exceed Li Yuefu's!

    "Fictitious Land, Real Rent." In Changshu, we saw a bow specially made by landlord Tan Qian of Nanfeng District for measuring fields. The bow opening was only 4 chi and 4 cun, which was 4 cun shorter than the ordinary prescribed size. Farmers told us that this bow was specially used for measuring land when renting it out. It could turn a piece of land that was only 8 fen into one mu when renting it out, and then collect rent according to one mu. Zhou Fulin, a representative of the farmers in Wujiang, said at the Jiangsu Farmer Representative Conference: "...One day, I asked my father: 'The land we rented from landlord Wu Xiaolan is said to be 8.6 mu, but why don't I see it when I look at it?' My father sighed and said: 'When farmers cultivate the landlord's land, where is there a full 100%? His 8.6 mu of land includes 1.6 mu of reed pond in the middle, and the actual land is only 7 mu. It's not that your father doesn't know about this, but the poor have no land to cultivate and have to endure it no matter how bitter it is!' Hearing what my father said, I was so angry that I cried." However, under the feudal landlord rule at that time, even if you were angry and cried, you still had to pay the rent of 1.6 mu!

    "Careful Calculation." At the Changshu Land Reform Exhibition, we saw a large abacus specially made by Gong Guotai of Nanfeng District, with a total of 21 rods, which is 8 rods more than the ordinary 13 rods. "Is a 13-rod abacus not enough to exploit the farmers?" We finally learned a new lesson.

    In addition, tenant farmers had to give the landlord some gifts during the New Year and festivals, such as a fat chicken! A few sheng of red beans! A bundle of sugar cane! Twenty or thirty eggs! When the landlord's family had weddings or funerals, the tenant farmers had to take time to help out for a few days. When the landlord went to the countryside to collect rent or visit graves, it was inevitable to provide him with cigarettes, alcohol, and entertainment. The tenants' expenses in this regard were also not small.

    Therefore, although the rent is generally only 50% of the normal output on the surface, the actual rent far exceeds this percentage when these extractions are added. How heavy is the land rent exploitation? Farmers in Jiangsu have two folk songs: "Singing mountain songs while transplanting rice, this year the harvest fills the barn, the ox contributes its strength and eats grass, the landlord eats rice and I eat chaff!" "Planting the fields on a large scale, harvesting dozens of dan of rice, the landlord comes to carry it away at once, leaving the farmers with no dinner!"

    The land rent in Jiangsu is not only very heavy, but also generally takes the form of in-kind rent. This alone can prove the existence of feudalism. Because in-kind rent is inseparable from the feudal economy in the stage of social development.

    IV. "High Interest Rates"

    Precisely because the land rent is too heavy, "leaving farmers with no dinner," they have no choice but to quench their thirst with poison and borrow money from others. Thus, the second knife is thrust into the backs of the farmers.

    The meaning of borrowing money for farmers is completely different from that of general industrialists and businessmen. Sometimes, industrialists and businessmen borrow money in order to earn more profit. If the profit is small and the interest on the loan is high, they calculate it and think that they will inevitably lose money or make little profit, so they can choose not to borrow. The interest on loans for industrialists and businessmen is often relatively low. Farmers borrow money to maintain the lives of their families, often including dinner for that day. Of course, they want to borrow at low interest rates, but they cannot avoid borrowing even at high interest rates. Unless they commit suicide immediately and make no plans to prolong their lives, farmers have absolutely no freedom or right to choose between borrowing and not borrowing. In this way, after paying the "heavy rent rice," farmers inevitably have to pay "high interest rates."

    How high are the high interest rates? Let's take the situation in Changshu to illustrate:

    High interest rates in Jiangsu also have names such as "rough three hukou," "mother-son debt," "turnover grain," "ride the wind and waves," and "interest-on-interest loan." Most of them are interest compounded on interest, like a snowball, growing bigger and faster. Once farmers are in debt, it's like "putting on a raincoat in the rain, the more you wear it, the heavier it gets," and they can never turn over. For example, Zhou Fulin, a farmer in Wujiang, said: "In 1947, we borrowed more than 4 dan of rice at high interest rates, and the interest alone was 3 dan of rice a year. We paid it back every year, but we could never pay it off. Even now, I still owe more than 3 dan according to the calculation. This is a thorn, we touch it every year and it hurts every year!" Another example is the Jiangsu folk song: "Interest-on-interest loan, pay one back three; interest on interest, doubles every year. Borrow for one year, pay back for ten years; several lifetimes, never pay off!"

    Although high interest loans are so terrible, many farmers in Jiangsu are in debt. It can also be said that precisely because they have suffered from the landlords' high interest loans, more and more farmers are in debt, and the debts are getting heavier and heavier. For example, in Xin'nong Township, Songjiang, 8 out of 10 farmers are in debt. Among them, Wangjia Village has a total of 86 farmer households, and 75 of them are in debt, that is, 9 out of 10 households are in debt. Not only are there many households in debt, but the amount owed is also very large. For example, in Yangdian Village, Yexie District, Songjiang, the total annual grain harvest of the entire village is only about 1,560 dan, while the debt owed is 1,300 dan, accounting for 80% of the annual harvest.

　　谁说“江南无封建”？
    ——土地改革中的苏南农村访问记之一部分（续昨）

    三、“租米重”
    苏南农村普遍流行一首歌谣：“农民背上二把刀：租米重，利钱高！农民面前路三条：投河、上吊、坐监牢！”这首歌谣反映着血泪的现实。“租米重”，就是第一把刀，是地主剥削用的第一种武器。
    土地是农民的“命根子”。因为农民离了土地便没法从事生产，便没法活下命来。而大部土地又被封建地主所占有。因此农民不得不向地主阶级租种土地，每年付出高额的地租。在农民看来，土地不租也得租；地租不付也得付，丝毫没有选择第二条路的自由。农民对地主的租佃关系，并不是普通买卖关系，可以合意则买，不合意则不买。农民永远不能从地主手里合意的租到田地，而且往往是在越加不合意的情形下，越加不能不租。因之，封建土地制度下的租佃契约，百分之百是片面的，只有农民写字据交给地主，保证按时缴纳“干圆净洁租米，无论天年水旱，不得短少升合”；却从来没有地主写什么字据交给农民的。这是在封建土地制度下的必然现象。就这样，第一把刀插到了农民的背上。
    全国一般的情形，是农民要把一年全部收获的一半交给地主。苏南也并不例外。吴县农民说：“六棵稻里有三棵是要交给地主的。”在现有生产力情况下，这种租额是叫农民够受的。如无锡梅村区强家桥，农民耕种一亩田，平均生产费用为大米七斗五升，生活费用为五斗六升，而全年正产物收入为二担二斗，两抵只剩余八斗九升。可是每亩要交百分之五十，即一担一斗作为地租。因之不足二斗一升。这不足之数从那儿补足呢？除了把必须生活费用由五斗六升减少为三斗五升外，再没有别的方法。这就是说，这种租额的剥削，不但攫取了农民的全部剩余劳动，而且侵夺了农民的必要劳动的百分之四十。
    但上述百分之五十的租额，还只是一般所谓“正规租额”。“正规租额”，在苏南也有高于百分之五十的。好比嘉定与宝山一带通行的“脚色田”，租额就占到全年产量的百分之七十五左右。但这方面情形，暂撇开不论。即以一般占产量百分之五十的“正规租额”说，实际上，由于地主阶级各种乖巧与毒辣的额外盘剥，农民缴纳租米的数量比这要多得多。且举几种额外盘剥的方法如下：
    “押租”与“预租”。在押租方面，如奉贤农民租一亩田，要先交五斗至一担五斗米给地主。金坛一亩的押租是大米八十斤至一百斤。常熟高英乡，抗日战争前每亩为伪法币三十至四十元。无锡更有个别佃农每亩要付出大米五担，押租简直和地价差不多。在预租方面，如南汇，一九四八年就交了一九四九年的一部分地租，每亩最少是稻子七斗五升，最高的是一担。押租与预租经常使农民欠下债务，使地主更增加一笔高利贷与投机买卖的本钱。
    “逾限加成”。这办法在苏南也很普遍。好比松江一带，地主每年收租日期有所谓“三限”：冬至前第十五天为“头限”，头限内可按规定租额交租；冬至前第十天为“二限”，二限内交租，照原额加收一成；冬至后第七天为“三限”或“满限”，限内交租再加一成。如果过了满限还交不清租米，有的地主就派许多地痞流氓与打手等到佃户家大吃大喝，凡是能吃的东西都要，非强迫着交清了租米不走；有的地主就勾结反动政府派枪兵把佃户捉去吃官司。
    “大斛大斗”。我们在无锡参观土地改革展览会，看见有一张照片上照着江阴杨舍镇所搜集到的大斛、大斗、大升共三十多个，都是地主收租用的。其中童兆芙的斗，比普通斗大二升；常士龙的斗大一升八合四勺；缪纲裕的二斗五升的斛有普通三斗大；郭枫崖的升，一升就大三合。在吴江展览会上也看到，地主吴鹤卿的五斗斛比普通大一斗，女地主张爱珍的五斗斛比普通大五升。在常熟展览上更看到，该县练塘区地主李岳夫的五斗斛，竟有六斗六升之多。农民因此有一首歌谣：“看见五斗斛，佃户全家哭；明算五斗斛，实在六斗六！”李岳夫收租一担，等于收租一担三斗二升。我们还不敢担保：大斛大斗中没有其他更超过李岳夫的纪录的咧！
    “虚田实租”。在常熟，我们曾看见南丰区地主谭谦特别制造的一张丈量田地的弓，弓口只有四尺四寸，较普通规定的大小短少四寸。农民告诉我们，这张弓是专为出租田地时丈量用的，它可以使大小只有八分的一块田，在出租时变为一亩，以后即照收一亩田的租子。吴江农民代表周富林，曾在苏南农代会上说：“……有一天，我问我爹：‘我俚租的地主吴小澜的田，说是八亩六，为啥我看来看去却没有？’我爹叹口气说：‘农民种地主的田，那里有个十成田？他的八亩六分田，中间夹块芦塘就是一亩六，实田只有七亩。你爹不是不知道这回事，无奈穷人没田种的苦，千刀万砍也只好吃下来！’听了爹这些话，我气得哭起来。”可是，在当时封建地主统治下，气得哭也还是得多交一亩六的租呵！
    “精打细算”。我们在常熟土地改革展览会上，看到了该县南丰区龚国太特别制造的大算盘。共有二十一档，比普通十三档的多八档。“盘剥农民，难道十三档的算盘还不够用么？”我们总算上了新的一课。
    此外，佃户在过年过节时要送地主一些礼物，例如一只肥鸡呀！几升赤豆呀！一捆甘蔗呀！二、三十个鸡蛋呀！地主家有红白喜事，佃户得抽工夫出来帮几天忙。地主下乡收租或上坟，烟酒招待一番也是免不了的。佃户在这方面的支出也不在少数。
    所以，租额表面上虽一般只是正产物的百分之五十，但加上这类额外的盘剥，实际租额却远远超过了这个百分数。究竟地租剥削重到啥样子呢？苏南农民有这样两首歌谣：“口唱山歌手插秧，今年收谷谷满仓，牛出力来牛吃草，地主吃米我吃糠！”“种起田来一大爿，收起谷子几十担，地主走来一次抬，弄得农民无夜饭！”
    苏南地租不但很重，而且一般是采取实物地租的形式。即此一端，也就可以证明封建的存在了。因为实物地租在社会发展阶段上是与封建经济分不开的。
  四、“利钱高”
    正因为地租太重，“弄得农民无夜饭”，所以农民不得不饮鸩止渴似地向人借债。于是第二把刀又插到了农民的背上。
    农民借债与一般工商业者借债，意义完全不一样。工商业者有时候借债，是为了赚取更多的利润。如果利润小，而借款的利息大，他计算一下，认为不免赔本或赚头不大，便可以不向人开口。工商业者借债的利息往往比较轻微。而农民借债，是为了维持全家大小的生活，往往包括当天的夜饭在内。利息低固然要借，利息过高也不能不借。除了马上自杀，完全不作苟延生命的打算，农民在借债与不借债之间，是丝毫没有选择的自由和权利的。这样，农民于缴出“重租米”之后，紧接着必然还要付出“高利钱”。
    高利钱究竟高到怎样程度呢？且举常熟的情形来加以说明：
    苏南的高利贷，此外还有“糙三斛”、“母子债”、“翻头粮”、“乘风浪”、“印子钱”等名称。大半都是利上加利，同滚雪球一样，愈滚长大得愈快。农民一经欠债，就像“落雨披蓑衣，越披越重”，永远没法翻身。好比吴江农民周富林说：“一九四七年，我俚借了四担多米的高利贷，一年利钱要还三担米。我俚年年还，年年还不清。一直到现在，照算我还欠三担多。这是个刺，我俚年年碰着它就年年痛！”又好比苏南民谣：“印子钱，一还三；利加利，年年翻。一年借，十年还；几辈子，还不完！”
    高利贷尽管这样可怕，然而苏南农民负债的却不少。也可以说，正唯其受了地主的高利贷，负债的农民才愈来愈多，而债务愈来愈重。如松江新农乡，十家农民就有八家是欠债的。其中王家村共八十六户农民，负债的更有七十五户，即十家中有九家负债。不但负债户多，而且所欠的数目也很大。如松江叶榭区杨典村，全村一年收获的粮食只有约一五六○担，而所欠债却有一三○○担，占全年收获的百分之八十。
