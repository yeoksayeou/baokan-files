　　Flue-cured Tobacco Leaves
    Ge Fuyuan, Yin Pengfu
    The planting of tobacco in China began in the early 17th century, introduced to the mainland from Luzon via sea routes, first being trialed in Zhangzhou, Fujian. However, at that time, Fujian mostly planted sun-cured and air-cured tobacco, without flue-cured tobacco. Tobacco leaves, after being fully baked and processed, are golden in color and fragrant in taste, unmatched by other tobacco leaves.

    The planting of flue-cured tobacco in China was a product of imperialists engaging in economic aggression and exporting capital to our country. Around 1912, the British American Tobacco Company (the predecessor of the Tianjin Yizhong Tobacco Company) began importing flue-cured tobacco seeds into China and extensively trialing their planting in the Fangzi area of Shandong. Due to China's soil, climate, and other natural conditions being suitable for cultivation, within a few years, the cultivation area of flue-cured tobacco quickly expanded, and Shandong, Henan, and northern Anhui gradually became the three major producing areas of flue-cured tobacco leaves in China. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, with the changes in the domestic situation, the production of flue-cured tobacco leaves was also promoted to the southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. China's flue-cured tobacco leaves are not only abundant in quantity but also excellent in quality. Before the War of Resistance, they ranked second in the world (only after the United States). The annual output, in addition to meeting domestic needs, could also be exported. Between 1911 and 1936, the average annual export was about 37 million pounds.

    Currently, the main flue-cured tobacco producing areas are Xuchang and Xiangcheng in Henan; Weixian and Linzi in Shandong; Fengyang and Dingyuan in northern Anhui; Fengcheng in Liaodong; and Guiding in Guizhou. Followed by Jianyang in Sichuan, Kaiyuan in Yunnan, Nanxiong in Guangdong, and Linfen in Shanxi. In the past, in Xiangcheng County, Henan, tobacco farmers accounted for more than 80% of the total number of farming households, and tobacco fields accounted for 40% of the total cultivated land area of the county. This was because the price of flue-cured tobacco leaves was very high in the past, and it was profitable for farmers to grow tobacco. At that time, the price of one jin of tobacco leaves could be as high as 27 jin of wheat, and the average was about 6 jin. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, not only did they not support the production of flue-cured tobacco, but they also purchased a large amount of flue-cured tobacco leaves and finished products from American imperialism every year. According to statistics from 1937 to 1941, the average annual import volume of tobacco leaves reached more than 79 million pounds, and the import volume of cigarettes in 1947 was more than 23,000 cases (according to customs statistics, excluding smuggling figures). This caused the domestic flue-cured tobacco leaves to become unsalable, severely打击ing (打击 is untranslated) the tobacco farmers' enthusiasm for growing tobacco; there were even tragic incidents in Henan where entire families committed suicide because they could not sell tobacco leaves and exchange them for food. At the same time, it also devastated the fragile foundation of China's national cigarette industry.

    Currently, the People's Government is giving strong support to the restoration of flue-cured tobacco leaf production. Such as the allocation of seeds, the construction of flue-curing barns, the supply of fertilizers, the regulation of coal for flue-curing, and the formulation of tobacco-grain price ratios; at the same time, the government is also strengthening state-owned trade tobacco purchasing agencies to carry out pre-purchases and allow flue-cured tobacco leaves to be used to offset public grain. The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, in its "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951," has determined that this year the national production of flue-cured tobacco leaves will increase by 324.8%. According to the government's tobacco-grain price ratio calculation, the income from one mu of tobacco can be equivalent to four mu of grain. This will play a huge role in restoring the rural economy.

　　烤烟叶
    戈福元　殷彭福
    我国烟草的种植早在十七世纪初叶，由吕宋岛经海道传入内地，首在福建漳州试种。但当时福建种植的多系晒烟、晾烟，而没有烤烟。烟叶经过尽烤、加工后，其色金黄，味道芬香，为其他烟叶所不能比拟。
    我国烤烟的种植，是帝国主义者向我国作经济侵略、输出资本下的产物。约在一九一二年，英美烟草公司（现在天津颐中烟草公司的前身）开始将烤烟种子输入我国，并在山东坊子一带大量试种。由于我国土壤、气候等自然条件适合栽培，不到几年，烤烟栽培面积很快扩大，山东、河南、皖北逐渐成为我国烤烟叶的三大主要产区。抗战后，随着国内形势变化，烤烟叶的生产又推广到西南的四川、贵州、云南等省。我国的烤烟叶，不但产量丰富，而且品质优良，在抗战前，即跃居世界第二位（仅次于美国）。每年的产量，除供本国需用外，还可出口。在一九一一年至一九三六年间，每年平均输出约为三千七百余万磅。
    目前主要的烤烟产区是河南的许昌、襄城；山东的潍县、临淄，皖北的凤阳、定远，辽东的凤城，贵州的贵定。其次为四川的简阳，云南的开远，广东的南雄，山西的临汾。过去河南襄城县，烟农占农民总户数的百分之八十以上，烟田面积曾占全县耕地总面积的百分之四十。这是因为过去烤烟叶价格很高，农民种烟有利。那时一斤烟叶价格最高合到二十七斤小麦，一般平均亦在六斤左右。但在国民党匪帮统治下，他们对烤烟的生产不独不加以扶持，反而每年向美帝国主义购进大量的烤烟叶和制成品。据一九三七年至一九四一年的统计，每年平均烟叶进口量竟达七千九百余万磅，一九四七年纸烟进口量为二万三千余箱（根据海关统计，尚不包括走私数字）。这就使得国内的烤烟叶形成滞销，严重地打击了烟农的种烟情绪；甚至在河南曾有因烟叶卖不出去，换不到粮食而造成全家自杀的惨事。同时也摧残了我国民族卷烟工业的脆弱基础。
    目前人民政府对恢复烤烟叶生产给以大力扶持。如对种子的调配，烤烟房的修建，肥料的供应，烤烟煤炭的调剂，以及烟粮比价的制定等；同时政府并加强国营贸易收烟机构进行预购，准许以烤烟叶折抵公粮。中央人民政府政务院在“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中又确定今年全国增产烤烟叶百分之三百二十四点八。按照政府烟粮比价计算，一亩烟的收入可顶四亩粮。这对恢复农村经济将起着巨大的作用。
