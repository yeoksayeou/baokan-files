　　Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government four years ago, it has trained more than 10,000 Mongolian cadres. These cadres have actively participated in managing the various affairs of their own ethnic group, and have worked hard in their jobs. As a result, their political awareness and work ability have gradually improved.

　　The leading organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have always attached importance to the work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres. As early as before 1946, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Association (the leading organ for the Inner Mongolia people's autonomous movement) established the Inner Mongolia Military and Political Academy in Zhangjiakou, training more than 300 young Mongolian cadres. In May 1947, after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government, it opened two military and political universities in Ulanhot City, training more than 3,000 Mongolian and Han cadres. At present, the region has ten middle schools with 3,600 young people, and has also established more than 3,200 primary schools, with a total of more than 262,000 Mongolian and Han students enrolled, serving as a source for cultivating Mongolian cadres. In addition, 485 Mongolian cadres have been sent to universities and specialized schools in other regions for further study.

　　The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government and the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Communist Party of China have made great efforts to promote and cultivate young Mongolians in various practical works. In the region's government, military, party affairs, and mass organizations, 8,811 Mongolian cadres have been promoted and cultivated. These cadres include the famous Mongolian cavalry combat hero Tai Xide, Hote Lao, and Mongolian folk artist banner Mao Yigen. Mongolian cadres account for a large proportion in the leading organs from the Autonomous Region Government to the leagues and banners. For example, among the 39 leading cadres of the Autonomous Region Government (including chairmen and vice-chairmen, members, ministers and vice-ministers, directors and deputy directors, etc.), Mongolian cadres account for 29. Among the 13 league leaders and deputy leaders of the six leagues, nine are Mongolian cadres. Among the 52 banner leaders and deputy leaders of the 32 banners, 41 are Mongolian cadres. In addition, there are 1,240 Mongolian cadres working in forestry, cooperatives, postal and telecommunications, banks, taxation, trade and other departments. There are also 252 Mongolian cadres serving in cultural institutions.

　　内蒙古自治区人民政府四年来培养蒙族干部万余人
    内蒙自治区人民政府成立四年以来，已培养出蒙族干部一万余人。这些干部积极地参加了管理自己民族的各种工作，并在工作中努力学习。因之，他们的政治觉悟与工作能力日渐提高。
    内蒙自治区的领导机关，一向重视培养民族干部的工作。远在一九四六年前，内蒙自治运动联合会（内蒙人民进行自治运动的领导机关），即在张家口举办了内蒙军政学院，训练出蒙族青年干部三百余人。一九四七年五月，内蒙自治区人民政府成立后，又在乌兰浩特市开办了两处军政大学，培养了蒙汉干部三千余人；现该区共有十处中学，拥有三千六百个青年，另举办三千二百多处小学，计有蒙汉族学生二十六万二千多人入学，作为培养蒙族干部的源泉。此外，并保送四百八十五个蒙族干部到外区的大学和专科学校去深造。
    内蒙自治区人民政府及中国共产党内蒙分局曾以极大的努力，在各种实际工作中提拔培养蒙族青年。该区政权、军队、党务、群众团体中，即提拔与培养了八千八百一十一名蒙族干部。这些干部中包括著名的蒙族骑兵战斗英雄邰喜德、好特老和蒙族民间艺人旗帜毛依根。从自治区人民政府到各盟、旗领导机关中，蒙族干部均占了很大比重。如自治区人民政府的三十九个领导干部中（包括正副主席、委员、正副部长、正副局长等），蒙族干部即占二十九个。六个盟的十三个正副盟长中，有九个是蒙族干部。三十二个旗的五十二个正副旗长中，有四十一个是蒙族干部。此外，在林业、合作社、邮电、银行、税务、贸易等部门中工作的蒙族干部亦有一千二百四十人。另有二百五十二个蒙族干部在文化机关中服务。
