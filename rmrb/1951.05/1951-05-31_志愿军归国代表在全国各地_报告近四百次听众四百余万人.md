    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning delegates, reporting across the country on the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting shoulder-to-shoulder against the American invading army, have garnered the ardent love and welcome of the broad masses of the people. According to statistics from fifty cities, Volunteer Army returning delegates have already given 382 reports, with an audience of over 4,590,000 people (this does not include the number of people who have recently listened to reports in Suiyuan, Wuhan, and various parts of Chuan South and Chuan West). The delegates have also successively made broadcast reports in various cities, with even more listeners.
    The first group of six returning delegates, after giving reports in the capital in February, set off in two groups: Among them, Delegates Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, and Zhang Fu successively went to more than twenty cities including Tianjin, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Xi'an, Baoji, Lanzhou, Xining, Dihua, Yili, Chongqing, Luzhou, and Wanxian to give reports, arriving in Chengdu on the 18th of last month and giving reports in Chengdu City and Huayang, Pixian, Guanghan, Xinjin, and other places.

The four delegates in the second group of returning delegates, apart from Delegate Wang Yougen who has already joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union to attend the "May Day" celebrations, the other three delegates, Gao Chao, Wang Jianhun, and Li Jitao, have successively given reports in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Yangquan, Xinxiang, Anyang, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Gui Sui, Baotou, and other places.
