    The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Call on Cultural and Educational Circles to Launch Criticism and Self-Criticism
    [This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th dispatch] Cadres from cultural and educational institutions in Northeast China discussed the film "The Life of Wu Xun" today. Liu Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China, said: "There exists in the minds of cadres and the masses in Northeast China a paralysis towards class enemies, and the viewpoint of class struggle is very blurred." Comrade Liu Zhiming called out: "Through the discussion and criticism of the film 'The Life of Wu Xun,' we must strengthen the education of class viewpoint and historical materialism." The Northeast Daily published the People's Daily editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" and the Party Life column "Communist Party Members Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun'" on the 24th. The Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a notice on the 24th, which pointed out: "It is imperative not to think that because the film 'The Life of Wu Xun' has not yet been screened in the Northeast, it has no impact. All localities should earnestly link with literary and artistic thought and creation, conduct criticism and self-criticism, clarify the confused thoughts on this issue, and enhance ideological and political combat effectiveness."
    Cultural and Educational Circles in Hankou and Guangzhou in Central South China
    Begin to Discuss and Criticize "The Life of Wu Xun"
    [This newspaper, Hankou, 26th dispatch] Cultural and educational circles in Central South China and Wuhan attach importance to the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." The Yangtze River Daily, Southern Daily, and New Hunan Daily have successively reprinted the People's Daily editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun.'" Xiong Fu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau of the Communist Party of China, wrote in the Yangtze River Daily on the 26th, calling on party organizations at all levels in the Central South region to learn from the lessons of blindly praising "The Life of Wu Xun" and to take practical measures to improve the ideological level of cadres inside and outside the party. On the same day, the Party Life column of the Yangtze River Daily pointed out that since February of this year, "The Life of Wu Xun" has been screened continuously in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and Kaifeng, and some newspapers have even praised Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun" without principle, which shows the ideological confusion in the cultural circles and the serious fact that bourgeois reactionary ideas have invaded the fighting Communist Party, which also exists in the Central South region. The column called on Communist Party members to actively participate in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th dispatch] People in cultural and educational circles in Guangzhou have begun to discuss the film "The Life of Wu Xun." After the cultural and educational organs of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City and the Propaganda Department of the Central South China Bureau of the Communist Party of China organized the main cadres of various units to re-watch the film, a symposium was held on the 25th to analyze the erroneous ideas expressed by the character of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun." Literary and art figures Ouyang Shan, Wang Weiyi, Chen Canyun, and others spoke successively. Li Fanfu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central South China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, also spoke at the meeting, calling on everyone to take the organization of the discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun" as the beginning of a systematic展開 of cultural and ideological criticism, so as to clarify the errors and confused ideas existing in the cultural and educational circles of South China.
    To help carry out this discussion, the Southern Daily and the United Daily have published the People's Daily editorial and other articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun."
