Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a counterattack on the entire central Korean front on April 22nd. According to preliminary statistics, in the eight days and nights of combat until today, over 15,000 American and British invading troops and Syngman Rhee's puppet army have been annihilated. Our forces have recovered many towns and vast areas north of Seoul, including Munsan, Kaesong, Yeoncheon, Uijeongbu, Gapyeong, Yanggu, Hwacheon, Chuncheon, and Inje, and are continuing to pursue the enemy southward.

Note: The American imperialists, with all their forces invading Korea and the Syngman Rhee puppet army, launched an offensive against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers from the Pyeongtaek, Anseong, Chungju, Jecheon, Yeongwol, and Samcheok lines, starting on January 25th. During the operation, the enemy also arrogantly clamored for "war of attrition" and "war of attrition." But after three months, until April 21, the enemy only reached the Kaesong, Yeoncheon, Hwacheon, Inje, and Ganseong lines, advancing only over one hundred kilometers. During this period, the enemy's losses reached more than 78,000 people, of which 47,000 were American invading troops. Facts have proved that it is the enemy who has suffered serious attrition. Now, as soon as our army counterattacks, the enemy retreats across the board. The offensive that the American aggressors have carried out for several months has once again been crushed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　朝中人民部队在朝鲜中部整个战线发起反击
    歼敌万五千余收复广大地区
    敌军全线退却我军正向南追击
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军于四月二十二日开始，在朝鲜中部整个战线上发起反击。据初步统计，在到今天为止的八昼夜作战中，美英侵略军和李承晚伪军已被歼灭了一万五千人以上。我军已收复了汉城以北的汶山、开城、涟川、议政府、加平、杨口、华川、春川、麟蹄等许多城镇和广大地区，并正继续向南追击敌人中。
    按：美帝国主义挟其全部侵略朝鲜的兵力和李承晚伪军，自一月二十五日起，从平泽、安城、忠州、堤川、宁越、三陟之线向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军发动进攻。在作战中，敌人并狂妄地叫嚣实行“杀伤战”、“消耗战”。但历时三个月，至四月二十一日止，敌人始分别到达开城、涟川、华川、麟蹄、杆城之线，前进只一百余公里。而在这一时期内，敌人的损失却已达七万八千余人，其中美国侵略军即达四万七千余人。事实证明：遭受到严重的消耗的正是敌人自己。现在一遇我军反击，敌人即全线退却。美国侵略者进行了数月之久的攻势，又一次被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军所粉碎。
