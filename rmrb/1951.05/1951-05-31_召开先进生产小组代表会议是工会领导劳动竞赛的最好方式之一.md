Convening Representative Meetings of Advanced Production Teams is One of the Best Ways for Trade Unions to Lead Labor Emulation
    Qiao Yuzhou
    Convening representative meetings of advanced production teams is one of the best ways for trade unions to lead the current patriotic labor emulation movement. This point has been proven by the representative meetings and symposiums of advanced teams or advanced producers convened by trade unions or newspaper offices in major cities such as Beijing, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Songjiang Province, and more than ten other medium and small cities and some regional industrial trade unions in the past two months.

    Since last winter, the patriotic labor emulation launched nationwide has developed on an unprecedentedly wide scale. However, one important issue that has not been well resolved is the method of leadership by trade unions in the labor emulation movement. As Minister Dong Xin of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said in response to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's question the other day: "The main problem in the current competition is that many trade union cadres lack experience in organizing and leading the competition." Therefore, "this is manifested in the fact that the competition conditions and plans in some units are not proposed in response to the main problems and shortcomings in the current production, or there are competition goals but a lack of practical and specific methods."

    The advanced team representative meetings convened in various places have gained preliminary experience in organizing and leading labor emulation. Through such meetings, the actual experiences and specific methods of the advanced teams can be exchanged; leaders can be helped to understand the situation of the labor emulation, check the difficulties and problems in the competition, and it is convenient for leaders to help solve problems; the experiences from the masses can be concentrated and summarized after mass discussions, and then promoted to the masses, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the intermediate and backward catch up, promoting the advancement of the competition movement.

    Shenyang is a region with better promotion of advanced experience. They have made full use of the methods of advanced team representative meetings or advanced producer meetings to exchange experiences. Therefore, from April of last year to the present, more than 670 advanced production teams have emerged in the city. These teams have made great achievements in production, improving enterprise management, and promoting labor emulation. Recently, after the experience of Jiang Wanshou in improving labor organization in the city was promoted in some factories in the city's nine industries, production efficiency generally increased by 20% to 80%.

    Zhengzhou City Federation of Trade Unions has done a better job in discovering problems in labor emulation through advanced team representative meetings, finding ways to help solve them, and promoting the advancement of the competition movement. The city checked the production situation of 40 challenge teams that responded to the Ma Hengchang team at the representative meeting. The inspection revealed that there were two different situations in the challenge teams: one was that they seriously studied the experience of the Ma Hengchang team and proposed challenge conditions in response to the main shortcomings in their units, and as a result, their challenge conditions had already been realized or largely realized. The other situation was that they did not study the experience of the Ma Hengchang team well, challenged for the sake of challenging, the conditions were general, and it was impossible to check the degree of completion; or they did not grasp the main problems in their unit's production, so phenomena such as disunity and low product quality still existed quite seriously after the challenge. The city's Federation of Trade Unions also checked its own lack of leadership and inspection of these units, and the lack of attention to this movement by general industrial trade unions and grassroots trade unions was one of the reasons for this phenomenon. Therefore, based on this situation, it was decided: to strengthen the leadership and inspection of the challenge teams in the future; to widely carry out patriotic current affairs education and promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang team among employees, and mobilize employees to widely challenge; and to convene a representative meeting of the city's challenge teams once a month to exchange and promote advanced experience.

    To hold good advanced team representative meetings, there must be sufficient preparation and clear objectives beforehand. This is also the preliminary and main experience of convening advanced production team representative meetings in various places. Therefore, the situation in the competition and the main problems that exist should be understood before the meeting, and then efforts should be concentrated at the meeting to solve them. This can avoid formalism in holding meetings.

　　召开先进生产小组代表会议是工会领导劳动竞赛的最好方式之一
    乔雨舟
    召开先进生产小组的代表会议，是工会领导目前爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动的最好方式之一。这一点，已由近两月来在北京、重庆、西安、沈阳、武汉、广州、天津等大城市和松江省以及其他十余中、小城市和部份地区性产业工会或报社所召集的先进小组或先进生产者的代表会和座谈会所证明。
    去冬以来，在全国范围内所掀起的爱国主义劳动竞赛，目前已有了空前广泛的开展。但其中一个重要而又未能很好解决的问题，就是工会对劳动竞赛运动的领导方法问题。正如日前中华全国总工会生产部董昕部长答新华社记者问中所说：“当前竞赛中的主要问题还是很多工会干部缺乏组织领导竞赛的经验。”因此，“表现在有些单位的竞赛条件和计划没有针对当前生产中的主要问题和缺点而提出，或者是有了竞赛目标缺乏切实的具体办法。”
    各地召开的先进小组代表会议在组织领导劳动竞赛上取得了初步经验。通过这种会议，可以使各先进小组的实际经验和具体办法得以交流；可以帮助领导同志了解劳动竞赛的情况，检查竞赛中的困难和问题，并便于领导同志帮助解决问题；可以把从群众中来的经验，经过群众性的讨论，再加以集中和总结，然后推广到群众中去，使先进的更先进，中间和落后的赶上来，推动竞赛运动前进。
    沈阳市是推广先进经验较好的地区。他们充分地运用了先进小组代表会或先进生产者会议的方式交流经验。因此，从去年四月到目前为止，全市已出现了六百七十多个先进生产小组。这些小组在生产和改进企业管理与推动劳动竞赛等方面，都有了很大的成就。最近该市姜万寿改进劳动组织的经验在该市九个产业的部份工厂中推广后，生产效率一般地提高了百分之二十到八十。
    通过先进小组代表会议来发现劳动竞赛中的问题，并找出办法帮助解决和推动竞赛运动前进，郑州市工会在这方面是作的比较好的一个。该市曾在代表会议中检查了四十个向马恒昌小组应战小组的生产情况。检查结果，发现了各应战小组中存在着两种不同情况：一种是认真地学习了马恒昌小组经验，针对本单位工作中的主要缺点提出应战条件，结果他们的应战条件就已经实现或大部实现。而另外一种情况则是没有很好地学习马恒昌小组经验，为应战而应战，条件笼统，无法检查其完成程度；或者是未抓住本单位生产中的主要问题，因而应战后仍相当严重地存在着互不团结、产品质量低下等现象。该市总工会也检查了自己对这些单位的缺乏领导、检查和一般产业工会与基层工会的对这一运动的不够重视，是造成这种现象的原因之一。于是根据这种情况决定：要在今后加强对应战小组的领导与检查；广泛地在职工中进行爱国主义的时事教育和推广马恒昌小组经验，发动职工广泛应战；并每月召开一次全市应战小组的代表会议，来交流和推广先进经验。
    要开好先进小组代表会议，事前要有充分准备和明确的目的。这也是各地召开先进生产小组代表会议的初步和主要的经验。因此，在会议前即应了解一下竞赛中的情况及存在的主要问题，然后在会上集中力量加以解决。这样就可以避免开会的形式主义。
