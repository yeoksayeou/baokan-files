Seriously Participate in the Discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun"
　　Recognize Wu Xun's Ugly and Shameful True Colors
　　Participating in the discussion about "The Life of Wu Xun," I deeply feel that I should seriously start learning from scratch.
　　Editor:
　　The discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has given me great inspiration. Wu Xun was from Shandong, and the people of Shandong were most deeply misled by him. There are many Wu Xun elementary schools in Shandong, and many people want to be Wu Xun. I remember when I was in elementary school, the teacher often told us, a group of innocent children, the story of Wu Xun establishing schools. From then on, I often aspired to be Wu Xun. Once, I dressed up as a beggar, holding a broken gourd, and went to my neighbor's house to beg, which made the neighbors laugh. After a relatively long period, until I joined the revolution, I still admired Wu Xun. This March, I watched the movie "The Life of Wu Xun." At that time, some parts aroused my disgust. Especially seeing Wu Xun kneeling in front of the landlord’s gate with that servile appearance, it was really hard for me to bear. At that time, I thought: if some parts of the film (such as Wu Xun's willingness to be a slave) were modified, this would still be a good film. In other words, I thought the film's subject matter was good, but the director's technique or character portrayal was not satisfactory.
　　Later, when I talked about "The Life of Wu Xun" with people, I mostly expressed praise. I did volunteer publicity for this poisonous film. It wasn't until May of this year when I saw Comrade Jia Ji's "Wu Xun is Not a Model" in the "Wenyi Bao" that my mind became clear. I began to deny the idea that "The Life of Wu Xun" had correct subject matter. Recently, I saw the People's Daily editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" and the "Party Life" column article "Communist Party Members Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" and only then did I attach importance to this important ideological understanding issue. I myself am a Communist Party member, and I usually consider myself an "old" cadre, not saying it out loud, but feeling in my heart that my theoretical level is not low; however, on the "Wu Xun" issue, my understanding was so vague, which could not help but surprise me greatly. Some of us cadres (including myself) seem to think that studying the history of social development is too "vulgar," or that we have already mastered it. Through this discussion of Wu Xun, we should re-evaluate our own ideological level. Let us learn more seriously and more humbly from scratch.

　　Some Incorrect Ideas About Discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" Should Be Corrected
　　Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" on the 20th, heated discussions are unfolding across the country. Some people who once praised Wu Xun have already or are conducting preliminary self-criticisms, but as far as I know, some of them still have some incorrect ideas:
　　The first is to secretly rejoice that the newspaper did not publish the articles they wrote praising Wu Xun or the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" or that they did not write such articles, feeling that "otherwise, it would be terrible!" and fearing open self-criticism.
　　The second is to think that the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is mainly a matter for the cultural circles and has little to do with general government cadres, party members, and the masses.
　　The third is to feel that when watching the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," they recognized that Wu Xun's reformist struggle methods did not solve practical problems and then smugly congratulate themselves on having made a discovery, unwilling to conduct deeper self-examination.
　　We must recognize that the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is a serious ideological struggle. Only through this ideological struggle can we improve our thinking. We often say that we must use the scientific Marxist-Leninist stance, thought, and method to transform our own thinking. Then, we must check whether our stance, viewpoints, and methods are correct when encountering practical problems, and then correct our own wrong understanding and improve our own ideological level. I feel that this discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" is an important ideological test for many of us.

　　People with Incorrect Understanding of Wu Xun Should Seriously Examine the Roots of Their Wrong Ideas
　　Editor:
　　Since the newspaper published comrades Yang Er, Jia Ji, and others' "Wu Xun is Not a Model" and other critical articles, it has drawn my attention to this issue. In the past, my understanding of Wu Xun was very vague. I followed the crowd and praised Wu Xun when I saw the movie theater's promotional advertisements. After reading the People's Daily editorial and Comrade Yang Er's critical articles, I began to discover the errors in my thinking and began to clearly recognize that to judge a historical figure, one must look at whether his actions and thoughts promote or hinder the progress of social history; one cannot ignore the essence of his actions just because he "suffered" throughout his life. For example, many of the rulers of feudal society did indeed climb up through "ten years of hard study." Of course, we cannot forgive their sins just because they "worked hard" to get to the top. The American imperialist Stuart Leidun ran schools to educate Chinese people to serve American imperialism. Should we praise him? Since the error in this issue is so fundamental in nature, everyone who has praised "The Life of Wu Xun" should conduct a thorough self-examination, thoroughly investigate the roots of their wrong ideas, and not just lightly self-criticize or bring up some objective reasons and consider it done. I read what Comrade Duanmu Hongliang said: "This is mainly due to our insufficient mastery of materials and cognitive biases, a careless style." I feel that this statement is not deep enough. I feel that the reason why many of us have failed to correctly understand Wu Xun is because we have not mastered the scientific historical materialist thought, viewpoints, and methods, and analyzed Wu Xun from the essence of society and class; but instead, we looked at Wu Xun with idealistic thoughts and viewpoints that violate history. With such a way of thinking to understand and evaluate historical figures, even if you master more materials, you will not reach the correct conclusion.

### 认真参加关于《武训传》的讨论  认清武训丑恶可耻的真面目

　　认真参加关于《武训传》的讨论
    认清武训丑恶可耻的真面目
    参加了关于《武训传》的讨论深感到自己应认真从头学起编辑同志：
    电影《武训传》的讨论，给我很大启发。武训是山东人，山东人受他的迷惑最多也最深。山东有很多地方都有武训小学，有很多人想作武训。记得我在小学念书的时候，老师就时常向我们一群天真的孩子讲述武训兴学的故事，从那以后，我也常常立志要作武训。有一次我扮了一个叫花子，拿着一个破瓢，到邻家去行乞，惹得邻人捧腹大笑。以后过了一个较长的时期，一直到我参加革命，我对于武训仍然敬慕着。今年三月，我看了电影《武训传》。当时，有些地方引起我的反感。特别是看到武训跪在地主门前那幅奴才相，实在使我难以忍耐。那时我却想：如果把影片中某些地方（如武训甘做奴才的样子）修改一下，这仍不愧为一个好的影片。换句话说，就是我认为影片的取材是好的，只不过是导演技术或人物表现不够如意。
    以后我和人谈起《武训传》来大半仍是表示歌颂的。我对这一部含有毒素的影片作了义务宣传。直到今年五月，在《文艺报》上看到了贾霁同志的《不足为训的武训》，心里才亮堂起来。脑子里开始否定了《武训传》取材正确的想法。最近，我又看到人民日报《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的社论和党的生活栏《共产党员应当参加关于〈武训传〉的批判》一文，这才重视了这个重要的思想认识问题。我自己是一个共产党员，平时又以“老”干部自居，嘴里不说，心里却觉得我的理论水平并不低；然而在“武训”这个问题上，我的认识竟至如此模糊，这就不能不使我大吃一惊。我们一些干部（我也在内）对于学习社会发展史，好像是觉着太“俗气”了，或者认为已经学通了。通过这次对武训的讨论，我们应该重新估计自己的思想水平。让我们更认真地更虚心地从头学起吧。

            应纠正对讨论《武训传》的几种不正确思想
    人民日报在二十日发表《应当重视电影＜武训传＞的讨论》社论之后，各地正展开热烈讨论，有些曾经歌颂过武训的人，已经或正在进行初步检讨，但据我所知，其中有些人却还存在着这样一些不正确的思想：
    第一种是窃喜报纸没有刊登自己写的歌颂武训或电影《武训传》的稿子或未写这样的稿子，觉得“不然才糟糕呢！”而惧怕公开检讨。
    第二种认为讨论《武训传》主要是文化界的事，与一般机关干部、党员及群众关系不大。
    第三种是觉得自己在看电影《武训传》时认识到武训改良主义的斗争方式不解决实际问题，便沾沾自喜于有所发现，而不愿深入检查。
    我们必须认识讨论《武训传》是一场严重的思想斗争，通过这种思想斗争，才能提高我们的思想。我们常说要用科学的马克思列宁主义的立场、思想和方法来改造自己的思想，那就必须在遇着实际问题的时候来检查自己的立场、观点和方法是否对头，然后来纠正自己的错误认识，把自己的思想水平提高一步。我觉得这一次对《武训传》的讨论对我们很多人都是一个重要的思想考验。

            对武训认识不正确的人应认真检查错误思想的根源编辑同志：
    自从报纸发表了杨耳、贾霁等同志的《不足为训的武训》等批判文后，引起了我对这个问题的注意。过去我对武训的认识是非常模糊的，看到了电影院的宣传广告，就人云亦云地赞扬过武训。看了人民日报的社论和杨耳等同志的批评文章以后，我开始发觉自己思想上的错误，开始明确地认识了：判断一个历史人物，要看他的行动与思想是推动或是阻碍了社会历史的前进；不能因为他毕生“受苦”就忽视了他的行动的本质。例如封建社会的统治者们确也有不少是由“十年寒窗苦”而爬上去的，对这种人，我们当然不能因为他是“苦心”爬上来的，而就原谅他们的罪恶。美帝国主义分子司徒雷登办学堂教育中国老百姓为美帝国主义服务，我们难道应该歌颂他吗？这个问题的错误，既然带有如此根本的性质，一切歌颂过《武训传》的人都应当进行深刻的检讨。彻底清查自己的错误思想根源，不只是轻率地自我批判一下或拉些客观原因，就算了事的。我读了端木蕻良同志说的：“这主要是由于我们所掌握的材料的不足及认识的偏差，是一种粗枝大叶的作风”，我觉得这种说法是不够深刻的，我觉得我们很多人所以未能正确的认识武训，是因为自己没有掌握着科学的历史唯物论的思想、观点和方法，从社会的阶级的本质上来分析武训；而是以违反历史的唯心论的思想和观点来看武训。以这样的思想方法来认识和评价历史人物，即使掌握的材料再多，也不会得出正确的结论的。
