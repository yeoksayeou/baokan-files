    Liberated Peasants in Linxiang, Hunan Help Neighboring Villages Solve Production Difficulties
    The liberated peasants in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, have demonstrated a high degree of mutual assistance and friendship. Peasants in some villages who received more fruits of victory have voluntarily helped their peasant brothers in villages where the fruits of victory were fewer to solve production difficulties. For example, in Xishan Township, most of the poor peasants and farm laborers did not receive cattle, and other fruits were also very few. Peasants in Taolin Township, seeing that they had great difficulties in production, voluntarily donated 10,000 jin of victory grain. The peasants in Xishan Township used this grain to buy eight head of cattle. Chenglong Township lacked twenty-four head of cattle and had no way to solve the problem. Peasants in Yuantan Township voluntarily donated 14,000 jin of victory grain. The peasants in Chenglong Township took this grain and, together with the fruits of victory they had already received, bought all twenty-four head of cattle. When the peasants in Chenglong Township went to Yuantan Township to carry the grain, they beat gongs and drums and carried a large red flag with the words "Peasant Emancipation, Mutual Friendship" written on it, and stated, "We will repay the help of Yuantan Township by striving for a bumper harvest this year."
    Zhu Ma Township has not yet implemented land reform, and poor peasants and farm laborers have not received the fruits of victory. They lack cattle, farm tools, and rations. Luo Ping Township also voluntarily donated 10,000 jin of victory grain to help them solve some of their difficulties.
    Peasants in Taodong Township saw that there had been a lot of rain and cold weather recently, and many rice seedlings had rotted, requiring replanting. Therefore, they voluntarily took out 15,000 jin of victory grain and handed it over to the Fourth District People's Government, which distributed it to various townships according to the actual situation of rotten seedlings to solve the problem of rice seed shortage.
    After the land reform, the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship that "all peasants under heaven are one family" has been greatly promoted among the peasants.

    湖南临湘翻身农民帮助邻村解决生产困难
    湖南省临湘县的翻身农民发扬了高度的互助友爱精神，某些村庄农民分得的胜利果实多，即自动帮助那些胜利果实太少的村子的农民弟兄解决生产的困难。如西山乡农民，绝大部分贫雇农没分到耕牛，其他果实也很少。桃林乡农民看到他们生产有很大困难，便自动赠送胜利果实谷一万斤。西山乡农民就用这谷子买了八条耕牛。乘龙乡缺耕牛二十四条，没有办法解决，沅潭乡农民自动赠送胜利果实谷一万四千斤。乘龙乡农民拿了这些谷子再加上自己已分得的胜利果实，就买足了二十四条牛。乘龙乡农民到沅潭乡挑谷时，打着锣鼓，扛着上面写了“农民翻身，互相友爱，”等字样的大红旗，并表示：“要用争取今年大丰收来答谢沅潭乡的帮助。”
    苎麻乡还未实行土地改革，贫雇农没有分到胜利果实、耕牛、农具、口粮都感缺乏，骆坪乡也自动赠送了胜利果实谷一万斤，帮助他们解决了部分困难。
    桃东乡农民看到近来久雨天寒，各地烂秧很多，需要补种。因此他们就自动拿出胜利果实谷一万五千斤交给四区人民政府，根据烂秧实际情况，赠送给各乡，解决禾种困难。
    经过土地改革以后，“天下农民是一家”的互助友爱精神，在农民中大大地发扬起来了。
