　　Fully Support the Victorious Battles of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces
　　Zhao Guoyou, Deputy Head of the Directly Subordinate Branch of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

　　I am honored to have been entrusted by the people of the entire country to go to the Korean front in April to慰问our respected Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. We personally witnessed on the Korean battlefield the heroic deeds created by the outstanding sons and daughters of our great motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteers—in the Korean War. In every battle, they dealt heavy blows to the American aggressors, exposing the paper tiger that is American imperialism before the people of the world. The great victory won by the Chinese and Korean people once again announced to the world that the people and justice are invincible! The Chinese and Korean people will surely win more and final victories!

　　In Korea, we also more clearly recognized the beastly nature of American imperialism, which is destroying human civilization.

　　After our慰问团crossed the Yalu River, we arrived at Sinuiju, Korea. This city in northern Korea was second only to Pyongyang in prosperity, but now it has become a pile of bricks, tiles, and scorched earth. On November 28th of last year, American imperialist aircraft first sprinkled streaks of gasoline around the city and then bombed and strafed it, turning the entire city into a sea of fire.

　　Along the highway from Sinuiju to Pyongyang, whether large or small towns, all were subjected to barbaric bombing by enemy aircraft, and even many hillsides and open spaces were full of bomb craters. The American aggressors have committed heinous crimes against humanity everywhere in Korea. They bombed, strafed, massacred, and raped everywhere. They cut off the noses and ears, gouged out the eyes, and severed the fingers and toes of countless peaceful Korean residents. In just Hwanghae Province alone, approximately 100,000 peaceful residents were massacred. In Sinchon County alone, as many as 3,500 people were victimized. In Chestnut Village in Sinchon County, there were two houses left by the Japanese devils that were used as gunpowder depots. The American and Rhee bandits locked some Korean women in the front house and their children in the back house. The American and Rhee bandits poured gasoline on the house where the mothers were locked and burned it to the ground. The children locked in the other house had nothing to eat or wear in the winter and all starved and froze to death. In Ximyeon, Pyeonggang County, Gangwon Province, the daughter-in-law of Seo Myeong-jo was nine months pregnant. The enemy stripped off her clothes, hung her upside down from a tree, and violently beat her stomach, causing it to rupture, the child to fall out, and the intestines to hang on the branches. As she was dying, she left a word: "The People's Army must avenge me!"

　　When the soldiers of our Chinese People's Volunteers saw the enemy's bloody atrocities, they were filled with hatred. They vowed: "Resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate these inhuman American imperialist beasts, avenge the Korean people, and fight to the end to defend the security of our motherland!" Every soldier of our Volunteers and the people of the entire country deeply recognize that if we do not drive this group of ferocious enemies out of Korea, will not our own mothers and beloved children suffer the same brutal and cruel massacre? Will not the countless factories, schools, hospitals, shops, etc., of our beloved motherland be similarly destroyed?

　　Indeed, the crimes of the American bandits have not intimidated the people of China and Korea in the slightest; on the contrary, they have deepened our anger and strengthened our will to fight. Now, most of the Korean youth have joined the People's Army. Taking the workers as an example, more than 29,000 railway workers signed up to join the army in one day. According to the statistics of the Metal Workers' Union, 800 metal workers joined the army in one day. The workers and women who remained in the rear launched a production increase movement after General Kim Il-sung called for "everything for the war." Korean workers often persisted in production under enemy aircraft bombing and strafing. Sometimes, when the power was cut off, everyone used hand-cranked machines to work. Because most of the miners joined the army, their mothers, wives, and sisters took on the arduous task of mining. Under extremely difficult conditions, Korean workers not only did not reduce production but also increased production. For example, the textile workers of Sinuiju completed 100% of their annual plan for 1950 on August 13, three and a half months ahead of schedule. The machine workers of Pyongyang completed their annual plan for 1950 four months ahead of schedule in August, exceeding it by 177.8%. Korean railway workers and the Chinese railway workers' volunteer aid Korea team worked together, day and night, often braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, to repair bridges and rush military supplies to the front. Some of them bravely sacrificed themselves, but the survivors did not flinch at all. In order to support the front, they worked at night and braved enemy bombing during the day. They stood in icy water up to their navels to build bridges. Sometimes, when the military supplies on the train caught fire, they braved the smoke and fire, rushed through the exploding shells, rescued the things most needed by the front from the fire, and transported them to the front as quickly as possible. Once, two trains loaded with gasoline, shells, bullets, etc., arrived, and some of the cars were hit by enemy planes. Stationmaster Kim Myung-hwa disregarded the enemy's bombing and rushed forward at risk to cut the cars into two sections, so that all but two cars of the two trains were not damaged. Railway worker Jeong Do-myeong, who was awarded the National Flag Medal, was once driving a locomotive to transport supplies to the front when enemy aircraft chased and bombed him. At this most dangerous juncture, the brave and resourceful Jeong Do-myeong immediately stopped the locomotive when the enemy aircraft swooped down, dodged the bombs, and then drove away at a very high speed. He fought the enemy aircraft in this way, dodging and feinting, and finally protected the locomotive and completed the mission. Since the beginning of the war, he has not lost a single vehicle.

　　On the side of our Chinese People's Volunteers, they are also creating amazing miracles with a selfless spirit, stubbornly striking the enemy, assisting the Korean people, and defending the security of their own motherland. For example, in the battle near Gaoyang, one battalion of our troops faced three battalions of troops from the US 25th Division and the British 29th Brigade, including artillery and tanks, with airplanes overhead, and the battle began like this. When our reconnaissance company entered the position, the enemy was snoring and sleeping. The reconnaissance team's soldiers calmly pulled the detonators off their grenades and threw them into the enemy's position. With a轰sound, the enemy was either killed or fled. At that time, the reconnaissance company's soldiers did not give the enemy a chance to breathe, throwing dozens of grenades in one breath. Before long, the American and British troops revealed their true colors, kneeling down in groups to surrender. Some held their heads in their hands, and some pinched their necks. After a while, the enemy's tanks came back to counterattack. At this time, our warriors happily said, "Come on, you unlucky tanks!" The warriors specifically divided the work. The warriors were ready, and the tanks that were doomed to die slowly approached. The warriors fought according to the plan, destroying 23 enemy tanks in one night. In the battle of Roadside Mountain on the Han River, three volunteer soldiers, with 60 grenades, one rifle each, fought an enemy battalion for two days and one night. In the enemy's first attack, they first used airplanes to bomb and then used howitzers to fire for three hours. The trees on the mountain were all hit. Then the enemy attacked behind the tanks. But the three soldiers calmly did not fire a single shot. When the enemy attacked to within ten meters, the soldiers threw out more than 20 grenades, repelling the enemy. The enemy attacked a second time in the middle of the night, and the soldiers repelled the enemy in the same way. The enemy's third attack was to first use airplanes to bomb, and then an American company charged. The three soldiers ran out of all their grenades and bullets, and finally used stones to fight. They held out for two days and one night, repelling three enemy attacks, with only one person injured. Comrades! In every battle on the Korean battlefield, our Chinese People's Volunteers annihilate the enemy with such bravery and resourcefulness; they closely unite with the Korean People's Army, fight side by side, and win victory after victory.

　　This time, the慰问团to Korea gave them great excitement and encouragement. When the慰问团arrived at each company, the soldiers immediately cheered. They were moved to tears. They said, "The people of the motherland are always concerned about us!" They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" They wrote letters of thanks and letters of determination, promising the people of the whole country: "Produce well in the rear! We guarantee to annihilate the enemy! We guarantee to defeat the enemy's navy, army, and air force!" When one soldier received a box of cigarettes from us, he said: "This box of cigarettes was sent by the people of the motherland. I will definitely not smoke it now. When I get to the front, I will take a puff of smoke and aim at an enemy!" The members of the logistics civilian labor brigade, whose three-month term was originally scheduled to expire, also said: "We will never return to our motherland until the enemy is annihilated!"

　　The righteous war waged by the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea is sure to be victorious, and victory belongs to us. But we must also estimate that we will encounter some difficulties, so we must fight arduously. Every Chinese must have sufficient understanding and preparation for this. In order to give the enemy a more thorough annihilating blow and to strive for faster and greater victories, we should fully support this war with practical actions and material strength.

　　This time, I personally realized that we should organize more worker aid Korea teams, such as train drivers and car drivers, to go to Korea. We, the working class, should give greater play to our initiative and creativity in the rear, increase production, support the front, so that the front can fully grasp sufficient materials, strike the enemy, and finally eliminate the enemy!

　　全力支援中朝人民部队的胜利战斗
    中国人民赴朝慰问团直属分团副团长  赵国有
    我很荣幸地受到全国人民的嘱托，在四月间到朝鲜前线去，慰问我们可敬的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。我们在朝鲜战场上亲眼看到我们伟大祖国的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中所创造的英雄事迹。他们在每次战役中都给美国侵略者沉重的打击，使美帝国主义这个纸老虎在全世界人民面前现出原形。中朝人民所获得的伟大胜利，再次向全世界宣布了人民和正义是不可战胜的！中朝人民一定还要获得更多的和最后的胜利！
    我们在朝鲜也更明确地认识到摧残人类文明的美帝国主义野兽的本质。
    我们慰问团过了鸭绿江，就到了朝鲜新义州。这个城市在朝鲜北部是仅次于平壤的繁荣城市，现在已经成了一片砖头、瓦片和焦土。去年十一月二十八日美帝国主义机群先在市周围洒上一道道的汽油，而后再轰炸和扫射，使得全城变成了火海。
    沿着公路从新义州到平壤，无论大小城镇，都受到敌机野蛮的轰炸，甚至许多山坡和空地上，也布满了炸弹坑。美国侵略者在朝鲜每一个地方都制造了灭绝人性的滔天罪行。它们到处轰炸、扫射、屠杀、强奸，它们把无数的朝鲜和平居民割掉鼻子、耳朵，挖眼睛、切断手指头、脚趾头。单是黄海道这一个道，被屠杀的和平居民就大约有十万人。只信川郡一个郡被害的竟达三千五百人。信川郡栗子树里，有日本鬼子留下的当作火药库用的两间房子，美李匪军把一些朝鲜妇女关在前面一间房子，把她们的孩子关在后面一间房子里。美李匪军在关母亲那间房子洒上汽油用火烧光。关在另一间的孩子们在冬天没有吃、没有穿，都冻饿而死。江原道平康郡西面至洞里，徐明潮的儿媳怀孕已九个月，敌人将她的衣服脱下，倒挂在树上，并用力打她的肚子，以致肚子裂开，小孩掉出来，肠子挂在树枝上。临死的时候她留下一句话：“人民军替我报仇呀！”
    我国人民志愿军的战士看到敌人的血腥暴行，都怀满了仇恨，他们宣誓：“坚决彻底干净地消灭这些灭绝人性的美帝国主义野兽，为朝鲜人民报仇，为保卫祖国的安全而战斗到底！”我们志愿军每个战士和全国人民同样地深深认识到，假若不把这群凶恶的敌人从朝鲜赶出去，我们自己的妈妈和亲爱的孩子不是同样地要遭受凶暴和残忍的屠杀吗？我们可爱的祖国的无数的工厂、学校、医院、商店等等不是同样会遭到毁坏吗？
    的确，美国匪徒的罪行不仅丝毫没吓倒中朝两国人民，相反地，更加深了我们的愤怒，也更增强了斗争的意志。现在朝鲜青年大部分都参加了人民军。拿工人方面来说：铁路工人在一天的功夫就有二万九千多人报名参军。据金属工会统计，一天功夫也有八百金属工人参军。留在后方的工人和妇女们，在金日成将军号召“一切为了战争”以后，全朝鲜工人展开增产运动。朝鲜工人经常地在敌机轰炸扫射下坚持生产。有时电源炸断了，大家用手摇机器工作。因为矿山的工人大多参军，他们的母亲、妻子和姐姐妹妹就担负了采矿的繁重任务。在极其艰苦的条件之下朝鲜工人不但没有降低生产，反而提高了生产，如新义州纺织工人一九五○年全年的计划在八月十三日就百分之百地完成了，提前了三个半月。平壤机器工人一九五○年的全年计划在八月份就提前四个月完成而且超额完成了百分之一百七十七点八。朝鲜铁路工人和中国铁路工人志愿援朝大队一起，不分昼夜，经常冒着敌机轰炸扫射，抢修桥梁，往前方抢运军火物资。他们有些人英勇地牺牲了，活着的人一点也不退缩。为了支援前线，他们夜里赶，白天冒着敌机轰炸也干。他们站在没肚脐深的冰水里，架起桥梁。有时候火车上的军火物资烧着了，他们就冒着烟火，冲过正在爆炸的炮弹，从大火里抢救出前方最需要的东西，尽快运到前方去。有一次，运来两列车的汽油、炮弹、子弹等，有的车箱被敌机炸着了，站长金明和不顾敌机轰炸，冒着危险冲上去，把车箱甩成两段，使两列车除两车箱外全没受损失。荣获国旗勋章的铁路工人郑道明，有一次，开着机车向前方运送供应品，途中敌机追着轰炸，在这最危险的关头，勇敢、机智的郑道明，便当敌机俯冲时，立刻停住机车，闪过炸弹，然后又以极快的速度开出去。这样躲躲闪闪地和敌机搏斗，终于保住了机车，完成了任务。他从战争开始到现在，一次没有损失车辆。
    在我们中国人民志愿军方面，他们也是以忘我的精神创造了惊人的奇迹，顽强地打击敌人，援助着朝鲜人民，保卫着自己祖国的安全。例如高扬附近的战斗，我一个营的兵力面对着美军第二十五师和英军第二十九旅的炮队坦克等三个营兵力，飞机还在外，就这样战斗起来了。当我部侦察连进入阵地的时候，敌人正在呼呼睡觉。侦察队的战士们很沉着地把手榴弹拉开了引火帽，甩进敌人阵地，轰的一声，炸得敌人死的死逃的逃。当时侦察连的战士不给敌人喘息的机会，一口气接着甩了几十个手榴弹，不大的功夫，美英军就现出原形，成群的一批一批的跪下缴枪。有的双手抱头，有的用手捏着脖子。过了一会儿，敌人的坦克又来反扑，这时，我们的勇士们高兴地说：“倒霉的坦克来吧！”勇士们具体地分了工。勇士们准备好了，送死的坦克也蠢蠢地靠近了。勇士们按着计划打，一夜打掉敌人二十三辆坦克。汉江路云山的战斗中，志愿军三个战士，六十颗手榴弹，每人一支步枪，和一个营的敌人战斗了两天一夜。敌人第一次进攻，先用飞机轰炸，同时用榴弹炮射击三小时。山上的树都被打着了。然后敌人跟在坦克后面进攻。可是三个战士很沉着地一枪不放。敌人进攻至十公尺的时候，战士甩出二十多颗手榴弹，把敌人打退。半夜敌人又第二次进攻，战士又同样地打退了敌人。敌人第三次进攻是先用飞机轰炸，然后美军一个连冲锋，三个战士把手榴弹和子弹全部打光了，最后就用石头来打，就这样坚守两天一夜，击退敌人三次进攻，只有一人负伤。同志们！我们中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上的每次战役，就以这样的英勇、机智歼灭敌人；和朝鲜人民军紧密团结，并肩作战，获得了一次又一次的胜利。
    这一次慰问团到朝鲜，给予他们以极大的兴奋和鼓舞。当慰问团到每个连队的时候，战士们立刻欢腾起来，他们感动得落泪，他们说：“祖国人民始终是关怀着我们！”他们高呼毛主席万岁！他们纷纷写感谢信、写决心书，向全国人民保证说：“后方好好生产吧！我们保证消灭敌人！包打敌人的海陆空军！”一个战士接到我们送的一盒香烟时说：“这盒香烟是祖国人民送来的，现在我一定不吸。我到前线的时候，吸一口烟，瞄准一个敌人！”本来预定三个月期满的后勤民工大队的队员也纷纷表示：“不消灭敌人，决不回祖国！”
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜所进行的正义战争，胜利是有把握的，胜利是属于我们的。但是我们也要估计到我们还会遇到一些困难，因此，还要做艰苦的斗争。每个中国人民都必须对此有足够的认识与准备。为了更彻底地给敌人歼灭性的打击，为了争取更快更大的胜利，我们应当以实际行动和物质的力量来全力支援这一战争。
    这次，我亲自体会到，我们应当组织更多的工人援朝大队，如火车司机和汽车司机，到朝鲜去。我们工人阶级在后方应当发挥更大积极性与创造性，增加生产，支援前线，使前方得以更充分地掌握足够的物资，打击敌人，以至最后消灭敌人！
