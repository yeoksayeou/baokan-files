　　U.S. Government Persists in Aggression Against China
    Will Inevitably Suffer a Greater Defeat
    Viktorov Comments on Rusk's Clamor
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th] TASS, Moscow, May 28th:真理报 (Pravda) observer Viktorov wrote an article commenting on the speech made by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rusk in New York. He wrote: Rusk very clearly stated that the task of American policy is to overthrow the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Dulles and Senator Douglas also delivered speeches with the same content at the banquet.

    Viktorov pointed out that Rusk's shameless and blatant remarks have surprised some Americans and many ruling groups in Americanized countries, especially in Britain, because Britain has suffered more than once from the adventurous policies of the American ruling groups. Rusk's speech aroused official and unofficial inquiries. What was the State Department's response to these inquiries? Viktorov emphasized that the State Department actually supported Rusk. Acheson said that Rusk's speech did not mean any change in the U.S. policy toward the People's Republic of China. Acheson's representative, McDermott, in "explaining" the meaning of this statement, pointed out that there was "nothing new" in Rusk's speech. In this way, McDermott admitted that Rusk had correctly explained the policy of the U.S. government.

    Viktorov continued, "Indeed, there is 'nothing new' in Rusk's speech." Thus, this speech once again proves that the disastrous defeat of the American Far East policy has not affected the American imperialists. There is no doubt that the result of adhering to this policy will cause the American policy to suffer a more disastrous defeat, and not only the United States, but also those countries that are increasingly linking their policies with the aggressive and adventurous path of the American ruling groups, will have to bear the consequences.

　　美政府坚持侵略中国
    必将遭受更大的惨败
    维克托罗夫评论鲁斯克的叫嚣
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：真理报观察家维克托罗夫撰文评论美国助理国务卿鲁斯克在纽约发表的演说。他写道：鲁斯克十分明白地表示，美国政策的任务是推翻中华人民共和国中央人民政府。杜勒斯与参议员道格拉斯也在宴会席上发表了内容相同的演说。
    维克托罗夫指出，鲁斯克的无耻的露骨的言论，已经使某些美国人士以及许多美国化的国家的统治集团大吃一惊，特别是在英国，因为英国已不止一次地吃过美国统治集团的冒险政策的苦头了。鲁斯克的演说，引起了官方的与非官方的质询，国务院对这些质询的答复是什么呢？维克托罗夫强调，国务院实际上是支持鲁斯克的。艾奇逊说，鲁斯克的演说并不意味着美国对中华人民共和国的政策有所改变。艾奇逊的代表麦克德谟在“解释”这一声明的意义时指出，鲁斯克的演说中并“没有新的东西”。这样，麦克德谟就承认，鲁斯克已经正确地说明了美国政府的政策。
    维克托罗夫继续写道，的确，鲁斯克的演说中“没有新的东西”。这样，这篇演说再度证明，美国远东政策的惨败对美帝国主义者没有发生影响。没有疑问，坚持这个方针的结果，将使美国政策遭到更惨重的失败，不仅美国，并且那些越来越把自己的政策与美国统治集团的侵略冒险路线连在一起的国家，都要负担其后果。
