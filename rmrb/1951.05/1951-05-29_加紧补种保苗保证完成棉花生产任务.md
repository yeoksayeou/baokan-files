　　Step Up Reseeding and Seedling Protection to Ensure Completion of Cotton Production Tasks
    Central Ministry of Agriculture, Industrial Raw Materials Department
    The national cotton sowing task is nearing completion. However, the serious problem at present is: in the main northern cotton areas, such as central and northern Hebei Province and the western Liaoning area, seedling shortages are relatively common in cotton fields due to spring drought. In the Yangtze River basin cotton areas, such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and eastern Sichuan, continuous rain has prevented sowing in most cotton fields. In cotton fields that have already been sown, some cotton buds have rotted due to cold and damp conditions. This could very likely prevent achieving the originally planned cotton planting area. To ensure the completion of this year's planned cotton planting area and yield, we should seize the opportunity and take all possible methods to strive to replant more cotton in areas where conditions permit and vigorously ensure that the cotton seedlings are complete in the sown areas. To this end, we offer the following opinions:
    (1) This year's solar terms are later, and in the Yangtze River basin and the Yellow River basin, for cotton areas that are accustomed to planting late-blooming cotton, it is not too late if planting is rushed in time. We should be good at using the farming experience of local farmers and vigorously promote striving to plant more late-blooming cotton. Especially in areas in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River that have not yet completed their cotton planting plans, even more efforts should be made.
    (2) The general agricultural proverb for cotton planting time limit is: "If you plant cotton at Small Fullness [solar term], you won't go home." However, in the plains, southern Henan, southern Shanxi, southern Hebei, and other places, many cotton farmers have the habit of planting cotton after wheat, and the yield is also very good. Therefore, some cotton farmers have proposed: "Planting good Small Fullness cotton can also yield a big harvest!" The main reason is that they planted early-maturing wheat and cotton seeds, there is high temperature in summer, and in terms of cultivation methods, they have achieved timely irrigation, topdressing, intertillage, topping, and pruning, which promoted the early growth and early maturity of cotton. In cotton areas with conditions and experience, planting cotton after wheat is worth paying attention to and promoting.
    (3) Cotton fields with missing seedlings must be vigorously reseeded. Areas with sufficient rainfall should try their best to promote and organize the masses to transplant seedlings for replanting. Areas where transplanting seedlings is difficult can be reseeded with early-maturing cotton seeds. Except for good seed breeding areas that need to persuade farmers to transplant seedlings as much as possible and not replant other hybrid varieties, general cotton fields are better off replanting cotton than abandoning and replanting food crops. However, in all replanting areas, attention must be paid to seed selection in the autumn. If Chinese cotton is replanted in foreign cotton fields, more attention must be paid to separate harvesting to ensure the good quality of cotton.
    Introduction to the Experience of Planting Cotton After Wheat
    Cotton after wheat (cotton planted after harvesting wheat), in addition to cotton areas originally adapted to the double cropping system, in some of the single cropping system cotton areas in southern Hebei Province, the plains, Henan, and other provinces, the masses also tried planting it very early, and some areas planted it quite commonly. General experience proves that if there are better irrigation conditions and fertilization conditions, and if appropriate cultivation techniques can be mastered, planting cotton after wheat can yield a harvest. Now we introduce the successful experience of a cotton planting expert in Pingyuan Province in planting cotton after wheat for reference.
    Lu Yanshang, a cotton planting expert in Xinxiang, Pingyuan Province, has continuously planted cotton after wheat for three years. In 1950, he planted two mu, yielding a total of 480 catties of wheat and 400 catties of seed cotton. The wheat yield and cotton yield were not lower than the average yield of wheat and single-season cotton in the whole village. The reason for obtaining this achievement is that he has accumulated the following experience:
    1. Intensive cultivation and seed soaking. Immediately after harvesting early-maturing wheat, water it once, apply 90 catties of cottonseed cake per mu as base fertilizer, and carry out cultivation and harrowing when the ground is slightly dry to prevent moisture evaporation. Then carry out seed soaking, put the seeds into a water basin, first add a small amount of cold water, and after the cotton seeds are soaked, add boiling water, stir as you add, until it is not hot to the touch, then stop stirring, then cover with a cloth and let it sit for three or four hours. After it is ready, take it out and mix it with plant ash, then put it back into the basin and add a little cold water, and after the water is absorbed by the seeds, it can be sown. The sowing method is the same as usual, but it should be shallower, so that all the seedlings will emerge in three days.
    2. Because cotton after wheat is planted late, all methods must be used to promote the growth of seedlings and catch up with the difference of single-season cotton. When thinning seedlings, keep strong seedlings and remove inferior seedlings. The first intertillage should be stable and shallow, so that the soil does not cover the seedlings, and the depth is only three fingers; the second intertillage should be deep, so that the roots can easily extend downward and develop outward, so as to absorb groundwater to supply growth; the third intertillage should be shallow to avoid root injury.
    3. Supply appropriate amount of water and rationally prune and shape. During the growth period of cotton seedlings, the roots extend downward, although they can absorb some groundwater, they still need to be properly irrigated to promote their growth. Too much or too little water will cause bud and boll shedding. According to this principle, Lu Yanshang only watered once before flowering. He bases his methods and timing of pruning and topping on the growth situation. His experience is that removing overgrowth branches and leaving ten fruit branches is better than not removing overgrowth branches and leaving five or six fruit branches. This way, the cotton bolls open early, and the harvest is good. Overgrowth branches and superfluous buds should be removed as they grow. When topping, first remove the top bud and then the side bud, so that the upward force can be transferred to the fruit branches; wait until the fruit branches have developed to a considerable extent before removing the side bud. The period for topping the top bud is when the top bud is upright and not growing, remove the green and tender parts, preferably during the Sanfu days, because the weather is hot, the wound heals quickly, and it will not suffer from diseases and insect pests. By the Beginning of Autumn, all top buds need to be removed.

    Timely Application of Topdressing Fertilizer Strive for Cotton Field Seedling Protection and High Yield
    Cotton is a crop that needs a lot of fertilizer. Base fertilizer should be applied before sowing, and topdressing fertilizer should be applied after emergence. In the past, some people were afraid that cotton fields would grow "crazy" - only growing branches and leaves and producing few bolls; or if bolls were produced, they would mature late and not be able to open. Therefore, they did not pay much attention to cotton field fertilization. In 1950, the high-yield achievements created by many cotton planting models by applying more fertilizer powerfully illustrated the error of this concept. For example, Handan Farm in Hebei Province selected fertile clay soil for cotton planting, applying 1,000 catties of horse manure, 50 catties of peanut cake, 20 catties of superphosphate of lime, and 20 catties of plant ash per mu as base fertilizer. Before flowering, 180 catties of soybean cake were added as topdressing fertilizer, combined with appropriate cultivation management techniques, the result was not only that it would not grow "crazy", but also created a high-yield record of more than 600 catties of seed cotton per mu. This proves that as long as it is combined with management techniques, appropriate selection of fertile land and attention to fertilization are necessary conditions for striving for high cotton yield. The experience of cotton planting experts also proves that: it is better to apply fertilizer in stages than to apply it all at once. In addition to base fertilizer, which should be the main part of fertilization, applying some topdressing fertilizer at the appropriate time has a significant effect on increasing cotton production. For example, the experience of Wang Peihuai, a labor model in Wu'an, Hebei Province, in 1950, adding 20 catties of oil sauce per mu as topdressing fertilizer, produced 250 catties of seed cotton, 80 catties more than the same cultivation without topdressing fertilizer. Applying topdressing fertilizer, on the one hand, can regulate and supplement the supply of fertilizer, matching the nutrients needed by cotton plants at all stages of normal growth; on the other hand, it can make the applied fertilizer fully exert its effectiveness, avoiding waste or loss due to one-time application.
    This year, in some cotton areas, the sowing period was delayed due to drought or cold and damp conditions, and many cotton fields underwent seedling transplantation or replanting due to seedling shortages, and the cotton seedlings were growing weakly. Under this circumstances, timely application of some quick-acting topdressing fertilizer, for late sowing and replanting, can promote accelerated development, transplanting can quickly restore growth, and weak seedlings can be strengthened, all of which can have appropriate remedial effects. Therefore, this year, the application of topdressing fertilizer to cotton fields is particularly worthy of attention.
    Matters needing attention in applying topdressing fertilizer: (1) Topdressing fertilizer must use quick-acting fertilizer, mainly oil cakes (soybean cake, sesame cake, peanut cake, rapeseed cake, etc.), oil sauce, and chemical fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus. (2) Raw manure cannot be used as topdressing fertilizer to avoid burning the cotton seedlings. Oil cakes used as topdressing fertilizer should be fully fermented before application. Fertilizers with small volume and small quantity can be mixed with fine soil and applied evenly. (3) The period for applying topdressing fertilizer can be after seedling thinning to before flowering, the sooner the better. For those who apply it once, it should be applied when the seedlings are five or six inches tall and the first flower buds are formed; if there is more topdressing fertilizer prepared, it is best to apply it in two times, the first time after seedling thinning, and the second time at the beginning of flowering, and the second application should be more than the first. The effect of fertilizer in dry land is slow to take effect, and the growth of late sowing and seedling transplantation is delayed, so topdressing fertilizer should be supplemented earlier. (4) For cotton fields sown by dibbling, topdressing fertilizer should be applied in holes near the cotton seedlings, and for strip sowing, it should be applied in ditches three or four inches beside the cotton rows, so that the fertilizer can be concentrated and exert its strength. (5) Pay attention to coordinating the application of topdressing fertilizer with the supply of water to promote the effectiveness of the fertilizer. In watery land, water should be poured first and then topdressing fertilizer should be applied (in dry land, it is best to apply it after rain), and after topdressing fertilizer is applied, the land should be hoeed once. (6) The type and quantity of topdressing fertilizer should be determined according to the fertilizer source, soil fertilizer deficiency, base fertilizer amount, cotton plant development, and other specific conditions. For ordinary soil that has been applied with an appropriate amount of base fertilizer, only oil cake is used as topdressing fertilizer, and about 50 to 100 catties or more are applied per mu, and about 20 to 30 catties of fertilizer powder are used. In addition to nitrogen fertilizer, the composition of topdressing fertilizer should pay attention to matching an appropriate amount of phosphorus fertilizer. Too much topdressing fertilizer should not be applied at one time (especially a single fertilizer), so as to avoid excessive development and delay maturity. (Chen Ren)

　　加紧补种保苗保证完成棉花生产任务
    中央农业部工业原料司
    全国棉花播种任务已接近完成。但是，目前的严重问题是：北方主要棉区，如河北省中部北部及辽西一带，因春季干旱，棉田缺苗现象比较普遍。长江流域棉区如江西、湖南、川东各地连续阴雨，多数棉田未能下种。已经播种的棉田，又因天凉地湿，部分棉芽腐烂。这样就很可能达不到原计划的种棉面积。为确保今年种棉面积及产量的按计划完成，应抓紧时机，采取一切可能的方法，争取在有条件的地区再增种一些棉花和大力保证已播种面积的棉苗齐全。为此，我们提供以下几点意见：
    （一）今年节气较晚，在长江流域和黄河流域，对种植晚花有习惯的棉区，如及时赶种，尚不为迟。应善于利用当地农民的耕作经验，大力推动争取多种一点晚花。尤其在长江上中游尚未完成植棉计划的地区，更要十分努力。
    （二）一般植棉时限的农谚是：“小满花，不回家。”但在平原、河南、山西南部、河北南部等地，许多棉农有种麦茬花的习惯，而且产量还很好。因而有的棉农提出：“种好小满花，也能大把抓！”主要原因是他们播种了早熟的麦种和棉种，夏季有高温，在栽培方法上做到了适时的灌溉、施追肥、中耕、摘心、打杈等工作，促进了棉花的早期生长和早熟。在有条件有经验的棉区，种麦茬花是很值得重视和提倡的。
    （三）缺苗的棉田，一定要大力补种。雨水充足的地区应尽量提倡和组织群众移苗补植。移苗困难的地区可补种早熟棉种。除了良种繁殖区需要说服农民尽量进行移苗补植不能补种其他杂种外，一般棉田只要补种了棉花，就比毁弃和补种食粮作物为好。但是，在一切补种地区，必须在秋后注意选种。洋棉里补种了中棉的，更须注意分收，以保证棉花的优良品质。
    种麦茬花的经验介绍
    麦茬花（收麦后种的棉花），除原来适应两熟制的棉区外，在河北省南部、平原、河南等省的一部分一熟制棉区里，群众很早也有试种的，有些地区种的相当普遍。一般经验证明：如果有较好的灌溉条件和施肥条件，又能掌握适当的栽培技术，种麦茬花是可以得到收成的。现介绍平原省一个植棉能手种麦茬花成功的经验，供作参考。
    平原省新乡植棉能手吕砚尚连种了三年麦茬花。一九五○年种了两亩共收小麦四百八十斤和籽棉四百斤。小麦产量与棉花产量均不低于全村小麦与一作棉花的平均产量。获得这种成绩的原因，是由于他积累了以下经验：
    一、精耕与浸种。早熟小麦收割后，即刻浇水一次，每亩施棉子仁饼九十斤作基肥，地面微干时即进行耕耙，防止水分蒸发。接着就进行浸种，将种子盛入水盆内，先加入少量冷水，等棉籽浸润后，再加入开水，随加随搅拌，直至不烫手时停止搅拌，然后覆布闷三、四小时。闷好后即捞出拌草木灰，再装入盆中加冷水少许，等水被种子吸收后即可播种。播种方法与一般的同样，只是要浅些，这样三天便出全苗。
    二、因为麦茬花种的晚，必须用一切方法促进幼苗生长，赶上一作棉花的差度。间苗时要留壮苗，拔去劣苗。第一次中耕要稳，要浅，不使土覆在幼苗上，深度仅三指；第二次中耕要深，使根容易下伸及向四外发展，便于吸收地下水份供给生长；第三次中耕要浅，以免根部受伤。
    三、供给适量的水份，合理地摘心整枝。棉苗生育期间根部下伸，虽可吸收一部地下水份，但还需要适当地进行灌溉，促其生长。水份过多过少，都会引起落蕾落铃。根据这个道理，吕砚尚只在开花前浇了一次水。整枝摘心的方法和时期，他是根据生长情形进行的。他的经验是去掉徒长枝，留十个果枝比不去徒长枝留五、六个果枝的好，这样棉桃开絮早，收花好，徒长枝和赘芽要随长随去。摘心时先摘顶心后去傍心，这样可以使上长的力量移到果枝上；等果枝发育到相当程度后再去傍心。摘顶心时期是在顶心直立不长时摘去绿嫩部分，最好在三伏天，因为天气热，伤口愈合的快，不至遭病虫害。到了立秋则需一齐摘去顶心。
    及时施用追肥  争取棉田保苗丰产
    棉花是需要多上肥料的作物。在播种以前要施基肥，出苗以后要施追肥。过去有一些人因为害怕棉花地肥了会长“疯”——光长枝叶少结桃；或结了桃，成熟晚，不能开絮。因此，不大注意棉田施肥。一九五○年许多植棉模范以多施肥料所创造的丰产成绩，有力地说明了这种观念的错误。如河北省邯郸农场选用肥沃的粘质土壤植棉，每亩施用基肥马粪一千斤、花生饼五十斤、过磷酸石灰二十斤、草木灰二十斤。开花前并加施豆饼一百八十斤做追肥，配合了适当的栽培管理技术，结果非但不会长“疯”，而且创造了每亩六百多斤籽棉的高产量纪录。这证明只要配合了管理技术，适当选用肥地和注意施肥，乃是争取植棉丰产的必要条件。植棉能手们的经验并且证明了：集中一次施肥不如分期施用为好。除基肥应作为施肥的主要部分外，在适当时期施用一些追肥，对增加棉花产量是有显著作用的。如河北省武安劳动模范王培怀一九五○年的经验，每亩加施二十斤油酱作追肥，产籽棉二百五十斤，比同样耕作未上追肥的多产八十斤。施用追肥，一方面可以调节和补充肥分的供应，配合棉株正当生育过程各期所需要的养料；另一方面，可使施用的肥料，充分发挥功效，避免因一次施下而致浪费或流失。
    今年一部分棉区因天旱地干或因天凉地湿延迟了播种期，许多棉田因为缺苗进行了移苗或补种，棉苗生长较弱。在这种情况下，及时施用一些迅速见效的追肥，迟播和补种的可促进加速发育，移苗的可迅速恢复生长力，苗弱的可使健壮起来，都能有适当的补救作用。因之，今年对棉田的施用追肥，特别值得重视。
    施用追肥应注意的事项：（一）追肥必须采用迅速见效的肥料，以油饼类（豆饼、芝麻饼、花生饼、菜籽饼等），油酱，含氮、磷质的化学肥料等为主。（二）生粪不能作追肥用，以免烧坏棉苗。油饼类作追肥，要先经充分酦酵后再施用。体积小数量少的肥料，可掺拌细土混施，以求均匀。（三）施用追肥的时期，可在定苗以后至开花以前，宁早勿迟，追一次的以在苗高五、六寸初结花蕾时施用；如准备的追肥较多，最好分两次施，第一次在定苗后，第二次在开花初期，第二次施用量应比第一次多些。旱地肥效发作的慢，迟播和移苗的生育延迟，都应早一些补施追肥。（四）点播的棉田，追肥宜在棉苗近旁穴施，条播的在棉行旁三、四寸处沟施，以使肥料集中发挥力量。（五）施追肥要注意和水份的供给配合起来，以促进肥料的效用。水地应先浇水再上追肥（旱地最好在雨后施），上追肥后跟着要锄一遍地。（六）施用追肥的种类和数量，应当根据肥料来源，土壤缺肥情况、基肥多少、棉株发育情形等具体条件来决定。普通已施适量基肥的，单用油饼作追肥，每亩约施五十斤至一百多斤，用肥田粉的约二、三十斤。追肥的成份除氮素肥料外，应该注意配合适量的磷素肥料。施用追肥不宜一次施得太多（特别是单纯一种肥料），以免过分发育，反而延误成熟。（陈仁）
