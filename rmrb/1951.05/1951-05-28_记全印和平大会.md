　　Record of the All-India Peace Conference

　　The All-India Peace Conference, held in Bombay from May 11th to 13th, marks a new upsurge in the peace movement of the Indian people.

　　The conference was held in a beautifully decorated conference hall. The conference hall was plastered with various slogans and cartoons, among which the most eye-catching slogan was "Stop the war in Asia, withdraw foreign troops!" This is also the solemn call of the conference.

　　On the 11th, the conference opened. Dr. Edward and 26 other representatives from all walks of life in India were elected to the presidium amidst thunderous cheers. In his opening remarks, Dr. Saifuddin said: "We will not allow any country to rule our land and exploit our minerals and other resources." Edward spoke, condemning the United States for its aggression against Korea and China.

　　Chandra, Secretary-General of the Conference Preparatory Committee, put forward four tasks for the Indian peace movement in his report to the conference: (1) Expand the peace movement, (2) Intensify the signature campaign for the Peace Pact Declaration, (3) Formulate a peace movement program to prevent India from being involved in the war, and (4) Strengthen the organization of the peace movement.

　　Congratulatory messages to the conference from the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, the "People's China" magazine, and the American peace fighter Robertson were warmly cheered by all those present. The congratulatory message from the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression said: "The unity of the more than 800 million people of China and India is a powerful force for guaranteeing peace in Asia."

　　At the meetings on the 12th and 13th, 50 representatives spoke successively. The speakers unanimously expressed their wholehearted support for the peace movement. The representatives demanded that every effort be made to prevent the imperialist warmongers from turning India into a base for aggressive war. One representative said: If the imperialists want to use Indian territory as a base to attack the Soviet Union and People's China, the Indian people—workers, peasants, youth, intellectuals, and every peace-loving person—will unite like one person to stand up against those imperialist vampires. This sentence aroused prolonged and warm applause from the audience.

　　The conference formed four committees to carry out their work separately. These four committees were: the Organizational Committee, the Committee on War and Colonial Issues in Asian Territories, the Committee on India-Pakistan Relations, and the Committee on Foreign Cultural and Economic Relations. The four committees separately passed various resolutions. The resolution of the Committee on War and Colonial Issues in Asian Territories condemned imperialism for "continuing to wage colonial and interventionist wars in many parts of Asia, such as Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya," and pointed out: "The concerted action of the people of all countries to strive for peace is the decisive factor for the people of the colonies and dependencies to realize their right to national self-determination." The resolution on the Korean issue passed by the committee demanded that a conference of all relevant countries be convened immediately to find a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The resolution also called for an investigation into American atrocities in Korea. The resolution on the Japanese issue opposed the revival of Japanese militarism and a separate peace treaty with Japan, and demanded the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan to guarantee the democratic and peaceful life of the Japanese people.

　　The India-Pakistan Relations Committee called for a peaceful settlement of all disputes between India and Pakistan. The resolution suggested that India and Pakistan send friendly peace delegations to each other to promote friendly relations between the two countries.

　　The resolution passed by the Committee on Foreign Cultural and Economic Relations advocated encouraging cultural exchanges between countries, opposing war propaganda and creating national hatred; and advocating the establishment of unrestricted trade and commercial relations with all countries in the world without discrimination, and obtaining assistance from other countries without any political conditions.

　　The resolution of the Organizational Committee decided to take various measures to expand the peace movement in India, and the resolution stipulated various specific measures.

　　The conference passed a resolution in support of the conclusion of a peace pact. The resolution said: "The conference wholeheartedly supports the current movement to sign the World Peace Council declaration, and believes that this is a new and decisive milestone in the courageous struggle to defend peace." The conference telegraphed the World Peace Council, promising to widely publicize the decisions of the World Peace Conference. The conference also decided to raise one million rupees for the Indian Peace Prize.

　　In order to strengthen leadership and further develop the Indian peace movement, the conference elected about 150 people to form the All-India Peace Council. Saifuddin was elected Chairman of the Council, Edward, Kosambi, Sendral, Kapoor, and Annada were elected Vice-Chairmen, and Chandra was elected Secretary-General.

　　This conference was a gathering of peace-loving people from all walks of life in a vast area. The representatives who attended the conference came from all over India. Namely: 38 from Bihar, 21 from West Bengal, 26 from Punjab, 14 from Hyderabad, 26 from the United Provinces, 10 from the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, 15 from Bombay, 9 from Delhi, 14 from the Central Provinces, 4 from Jammu and Kashmir, 3 from Central India, 9 from Maharashtra, 4 from Rajasthan, 2 from Orissa, 1 from Assam, 17 from Kerala, 13 from Gujarat, 9 from Tamil Nadu, 15 from Andhra, 11 from Karnataka, plus representatives who came later from afar, totaling 281. In addition, there were members of the preparatory committee composed of prominent figures in Indian society who attended the conference. The occupations of the representatives included workers, peasants, students, writers, artists, scientists, engineers, teachers, political leaders, industrialists, merchants, missionaries, veterans, and housewives. The All-India Trade Union Congress, the All-India Student Federation, the Progressive Writers Association, the Indian People's Theatre Association, the Democratic Women's League, the Women's Self-Defense League, the Farmers' Association, and other progressive mass organizations all had representatives attending the conference. The conference representatives included members and leaders of the following political parties: the Communist Party of India, the Indian National Congress, the All-India Forward Bloc, some anti-American imperialist Socialists, the Peasants and Workers Party, the All-India Unified Socialist Organization, and other parties.

　　After the conference closed, the representatives returned to their respective places with confidence. As they left, they expressed their intention to convey the situation of the conference to every village and every family in India, and to work towards the established goal of collecting 1.1 million signatures for the Peace Pact Declaration.

    从五月十一日到十三日在孟买举行的全印和平大会，标志着印度人民的和平运动的新的高涨。
    大会在一间装饰得很漂亮的会议厅里举行。会议厅里张贴着各种标语和漫画，其中最引人注目的一幅标语是“停止在亚洲的战争，撤退外国军队！”这也是大会的庄严呼声。
    十一日，大会开幕。爱德华博士等二十六位印度各界的代表人士，在如雷的欢呼声中当选为主席团。赛福丁博士致开幕词时说：“我们不许任何国家统治我们的国土，榨取我们的矿产及其他资源。”爱德华发言时谴责美国侵略朝鲜和中国。
