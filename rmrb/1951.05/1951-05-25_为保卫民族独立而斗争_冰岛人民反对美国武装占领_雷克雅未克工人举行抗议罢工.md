　　Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: According to a TASS report: The Icelandic people have launched the broadest people's movement in their history, rising up to oppose the armed occupation of Iceland by the United States military. The United States military first landed at Keflavik Airport, 50 kilometers from the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik, on May 7th. Several days later, Washington announced that the United States and the Icelandic government had signed a military agreement on May 5th, according to which the United States military has the right to occupy Iceland and establish military bases in Iceland. Now, American troops are arriving in a steady stream. According to the *Sjóðvíkingur* newspaper, by the end of May, the US military will number three to four thousand, occupying important bases throughout the island.

　　This act of aggression by the United States, which completely destroys Icelandic sovereignty and drags the Icelandic people into the disaster of war, has aroused extreme indignation among the broad masses of the Icelandic people. The Icelandic Socialist Unity Party first issued a statement on the 10th, denouncing the United States military's occupation of Iceland, declaring that the Icelandic people will not be bound by the agreement signed by the government, and calling on the people to unite and fight to defend their independence. On May 18th, the people of Reykjavik held the largest gathering in their history to protest the American occupation of Iceland. The conference adopted a resolution calling on the Icelandic people to establish a people's united front to oppose the occupation and demand the withdrawal of US occupation troops. On the same day, the largest strike in Icelandic history broke out in Reykjavik, with 80 percent of local union members participating in the strike to oppose the aggressive policies of the United States and the traitorous policies of the Icelandic government. The protest movement is continuing to develop. The Icelandic Socialist Youth League called on all youth groups in the country to unite in the struggle for Iceland's national independence. According to the Danish newspaper *Land og Folk*, members of the Icelandic Student Union in Copenhagen, the Danish capital, unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the American occupation of Iceland and calling on all Icelanders to support Iceland's national independence, not to deal with foreign occupation troops, and to establish a strong national united front.

　　为保卫民族独立而斗争
    冰岛人民反对美国武装占领
    雷克雅未克工人举行抗议罢工
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社报道：冰岛人民已展开了历史上最广大的人民运动，奋起反对美国军队对冰岛的武装占领。美国军队五月七日在距冰岛首都雷克雅未克五十公里的凯夫拉维克机场首次登陆。几天以后，华盛顿方才宣布美国与冰岛政府已在五月五日签订了一个军事协定，根据这个协定，美国军队有权占领冰岛并在冰岛建立军事基地。现在，美国军队正在源源开到。据《塞约得维京报》报道，到五月底，美国军队将达三四千人，遍占全岛重要基地。
    美国这个完全摧毁冰岛主权，把冰岛人民拖入战争灾难的侵略行动，激起了冰岛广大人民极度的愤慨。冰岛统一社会党首先于十日发表声明，痛斥美国军队占领冰岛，宣布冰岛人民决不受政府所签订的协定的约束，号召人民团结起来为保卫独立而斗争。五月十八日，雷克雅未克人民举行了他们历史上空前未有的最大的一次集会，抗议美国占领冰岛。大会决议号召冰岛人民建立人民统一战线，反对占领和要求美国撤退占领军。同日，在雷克雅未克爆发了冰岛历史上规模最大的一次罢工，当地百分之八十的工会会员参加了这次罢工，反对美国的侵略政策和冰岛政府的卖国政策。现在抗议运动正在继续发展。冰岛社会主义青年联盟号召全国所有的青年团体在为冰岛的民族独立而进行的斗争中团结起来。据丹麦《国土与人民》报报道，丹麦首都哥本哈根的冰岛学生联合会会员也一致通过决议，痛斥美国占领冰岛，并号召一切冰岛人拥护冰岛的民族独立，不与外国占领军打交道，和建立强大的民族统一战线。
