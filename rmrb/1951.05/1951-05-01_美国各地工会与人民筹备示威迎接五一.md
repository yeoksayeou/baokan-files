(TASS dispatch from New York, April 25th) The American people are actively preparing for May Day demonstrations.

The United Labor and People's May Day Celebration Committee, established as early as February 20th this year, met on April 19th. The meeting was attended by 250 representatives selected from millions of union members, youth from all walks of life, and various national organizations. They drafted a plan for the May Day demonstrations and decided to redouble their efforts to ensure the participation of the broad masses of working people in New York.

Various enterprises, unions, and organizations in New York are actively preparing for the May Day demonstrations. Many groups have responded to the May Day Celebration Committee's call to participate in the demonstrations. Six hundred leaders from various branches of the Fur Workers Union have adopted the United Committee's call to participate in the May Day demonstrations and have telegraphed Truman, demanding that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and that a five-power peace pact be negotiated and concluded.

The New York *Daily Worker* calls on all working people in New York to participate in the May Day demonstrations, calling on them to loudly demand "a peace-loving America, an America without racial discrimination and anti-Semitism; to demand new homes and new schools, not warships, atomic bombs, machine guns, and to oppose lowering the living standards of the broad masses of the American people."

In California, the local organization of the Communist Party issued a declaration calling on the people of California to make the struggle for peace the slogan for celebrating May Day. The declaration also called on all peace advocates, all progressive elements in the labor movement, and all anti-fascists to organize May Day mass rallies, mobilize all working people to fight for peace, against wage freezes, for the rights of blacks and minorities, and to defend the constitutional freedoms that are increasingly threatened by fascism.

　　美国各地工会与人民筹备示威迎接五一
    【本报讯】塔斯社纽约四月二十五日讯：美国人民正在积极进行五一节示威的筹备工作。
    早在今年二月二十日就成立的美国工会与人民庆祝五一节联合委员会，在四月十九日开会，参加会议的有千千万万工会会员、各界青年与各全国性团体选派出来的二百五十名代表。他们草拟了五一节示威的计划，决定加倍努力以确保纽约广大的劳动人民参加示威。
    纽约各企业、工会、及各团体正在积极从事五一节示威的筹备工作。许多团体都已经响应了庆祝五一节联合委员会的参加示威的号召。毛皮工人工会各地分会的六百名领袖，已经通过了联合委员会要求参加五一节示威的号召，并且致电杜鲁门，要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜和谈判缔结五大国和平公约。
    纽约《工人日报》号召纽约所有劳动人民参加五一节示威，号召他们起来大声疾呼，要求有一个“爱好和平的美国，没有人种歧视与没有反犹太主义的美国；要求新住宅与新学校，不要军舰、原子弹、机关枪，并且反对压低美国广大人民群众的生活水准。”
    在加利福尼亚州，共产党的地方组织发表了一个宣言，要求加利福尼亚人民把为争取和平而斗争作为庆祝五一节的口号。宣言并号召一切和平拥护者，一切劳工运动中的进步分子，一切反法西斯人士，组织五一节群众集会，动员一切劳动人民为争取和平，反对冻结工资，为争取黑人与少数民族的权利，为保卫日益受到法西斯主义威胁的宪法自由而斗争。
