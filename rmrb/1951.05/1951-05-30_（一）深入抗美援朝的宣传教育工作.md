   (I) Deepen the Propaganda and Education Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    The results of spot checks in many places prove that we still need to continue our efforts to ensure that everyone in the country receives patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. At present, there are still many blank spots in propaganda work in large and medium-sized cities. For example, in Shanghai's privately-owned Zhongfang No. 2 Factory, most of the male workers and workers in the weaving department understand the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea, but there are still many blank spots. In the B-shift tube-shaking room, even the workshop committee member doesn't know why it is necessary to resist America and aid Korea. In Jinzhou City's Chang'an Street, although 85 percent of the residents have a preliminary understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea, only 5 percent of them understand it thoroughly. In Guangzhou's Yonghan District, only 40 percent of those tested knew the reason for "Why resist America and aid Korea." In small cities, market towns, and especially in rural areas, there are even more blank spots in propaganda work. For example, in rural areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and southern Jiangsu, generally only about 50 percent of the population has received preliminary patriotic education. In better areas, 70 to 80 percent of the population has received education on resisting America and aiding Korea, while in poorer areas only 20 to 30 percent have received education. In most rural areas of Hunan, patriotic propaganda and education work is only now beginning to unfold. Even in Linfen County, Shanxi, where the movement has been carried out relatively well, there are still 20 percent of rural people who do not understand the significance of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement. This situation shows that in order to achieve the goal of ensuring that everyone in the country receives patriotic education, it is necessary to continue to eliminate blank spots and weak areas in propaganda work on the basis of shifting the Resist America and Aid Korea movement to a regular basis, especially to continue to popularize the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea in rural areas, so that the movement can achieve balanced development throughout the country and further develop in depth.
    Recently, Shanxi, Jiangxi and other places have formulated plans to continue to popularize the Resist America and Aid Korea movement in depth, especially to concentrate a part of the propaganda force to focus on breaking through the blank spots and weak areas in the countryside in May and June. These plans have decided to take the following steps and methods: (1) Combine the central tasks of rural areas, such as land reform, rent reduction and anti-despotism, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and patriotic production increase competition, to carry out education on resisting America and aiding Korea, in order to continuously improve the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of farmers, promote the progress of various tasks, and lay the foundation for future in-depth patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. (2) Because it is currently the busy farming season, the propaganda methods must be flexible. Generally, it is not advisable to hold large-scale meetings, but more use should be made of evening gaps to hold small forums for farmers, youth, women, members of the Communist Youth League, and militiamen, and to organize small-scale accusation meetings; guide them from the suffering of farmers themselves from the local bullies, landlords, counter-revolutionaries, Chiang bandits, and Japanese invaders, to hating American imperialism. In order to maintain the continuity of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, attention must also be paid to the establishment and consolidation of various organizations related to the Resist America and Aid Korea movement in rural areas during the concentrated propaganda, such as rural Resist America and Aid Korea committees, propaganda stations, reading groups, people's schools, and literacy classes. (3) On the basis of popularizing the Resist America and Aid Korea movement in rural areas, universally mobilize farmers to formulate patriotic pacts after full deliberation and discussion, so as to closely combine the production, life and political struggle tasks of the rural masses through this patriotic pact, and better carry out mass land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries and patriotic production increase competition movement. These methods are worth referring to by other regions.

   （一）深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作
    许多地方的抽查结果证明，要使全国每处每人都受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，还须要我们继续努力。目前在大、中城市，仍然存在着不少的宣传工作空白点。例如上海市的私营中纺二厂，除全厂男工及织布部门的工人多数懂得抗美援朝意义外，其余还存在许多空白点，在乙班筒摇间，连车间委员也不知道为什么要抗美援朝。锦州市的长安街，虽有百分之八十五的居民对抗美援朝有了初步了解，但其中仅百分之五了解得比较透彻。广州市永汉区的居民知道“为什么要抗美援朝”道理的，仅占被测验者的百分之四十。在小城市、集镇，特别是农村，宣传工作的空白点还要多一些。例如江西、广东、苏南等地区的农村，一般仅百分之五十左右的人口受到了初步的爱国教育，较好地区有百分之七、八十的人口受到了抗美援朝教育，较差地区只有百分之二十到三十的人受到教育。湖南大部分农村，爱国的宣传教育工作目前才开始展开。即以运动开展得比较好的山西临汾县来说，也还有百分之二十的农村群众不了解抗美援朝运动的意义。这种情况说明，为着达到使全国每处每人都受到爱国教育的目标，必须在使抗美援朝运动转到经常化的基础上，继续消灭宣传工作的空白点和薄弱区，特别是要在农村中继续普及抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，使运动在全国范围内大体做到发展平衡，并进一步深入发展。
    最近山西、江西等地已订出计划，要在深入中继续普及抗美援朝运动，特别是要集中一部分宣传力量，在五、六月份内全力突击农村中的空白点和薄弱区。这些计划已决定采取下列的工作步骤和方式：（一）结合农村各项中心工作如土地改革、减租反恶霸、镇压反革命、爱国丰产竞赛等，进行抗美援朝教育，以不断提高农民的政治觉悟和爱国热情，推动各项工作前进，并为今后深入抗美援朝爱国主义教育打下基础。（二）由于目前正值农忙，宣传方式必须机动灵活。一般不宜召开大会，而应多利用晚间空隙，召开农民、青年、妇女、青年团员、民兵等小型座谈会，组织小型控诉会；从农民本身受到恶霸地主、反革命分子、蒋匪、日寇的痛苦，引向仇视美帝国主义。为了保持抗美援朝运动的经常性，突击宣传时还须注意建立和巩固农村的各种有关抗美援朝运动的组织，如农村抗美援朝委员会、宣传站、读报组、民校、识字班等。（三）在农村普及抗美援朝运动的基础上，普遍发动农民经过充分的酝酿和讨论订立爱国公约，以便通过这爱国公约，把农村群众的生产、生活和政治斗争任务紧紧结合起来，更好地开展群众性的土地改革、镇压反革命和爱国丰产竞赛运动。这些办法是值得其他地区参考的。
