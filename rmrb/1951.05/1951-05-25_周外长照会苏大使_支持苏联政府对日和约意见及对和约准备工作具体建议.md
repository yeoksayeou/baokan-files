Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China received a copy of the Soviet government's note to the United States government on May 9th through the Embassy of the Soviet Union in China. Zhou Enlai, Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, sent a note to the Soviet Ambassador to China, Roschin, on May 22nd, stating that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the Soviet government's views on the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan and its specific suggestions for preparing the peace treaty. The full text of the note is as follows:

Your Excellency Ambassador,

　　I have the honor to inform you that on May 9th, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, via the Embassy of the Soviet Union in China, received a copy of the Soviet Government's note delivered to the Government of the United States of America, which detailed the Soviet Government's opinions on the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China expresses its gratitude for this.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China pointed out in its statement of December 4, 1950, that since 1947, the U.S. government has repeatedly attempted to reverse the procedure for the Japanese peace treaty and undermine the principle that the Japanese peace treaty should first be jointly discussed and prepared by the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The People's Republic of China has never prepared, nor will it ever prepare, to consider any draft peace treaty with Japan prepared solely by any one government.

　　Since September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialism has carried out armed aggression against vast territories of our country, causing significant sacrifices to the lives and property of our people. After eight years of heroic resistance, the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, it is a natural right for the People's Republic of China to participate in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan. However, the U.S. government presumptuously attempts to exclude the People's Republic of China—the sole legitimate representative of the Chinese people—from the preparatory work for the peace treaty with Japan. This is a great insult to the Chinese People, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The Central People's Government of the People’s Republic of China has stated more than once that without the participation of the People's Republic of China in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan, regardless of its content or results, it will be illegal and thus invalid.

　　After careful study of the Soviet government's views on the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Soviet government's views are fully in accordance with those of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China; Therefore, the Central People’'s Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the Soviet government's views on the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan and its specific suggestions for preparing the peace treaty.

(I)

　　On the issue of the procedure for preparing the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet government rightly points out that the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan cannot be the task of any one government, nor can any one government solely draft the peace treaty with Japan and consult the governments concerned for their opinions. It should be a joint task of the governments concerned; and according to the Potsdam Agreement, the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan should be carried out by the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, with the participation of other relevant governments. However, the U.S. government insists on going its own way, preparing the draft peace treaty with Japan alone, and forcing other Allied countries to accept it under the guise of consulting the governments concerned; this undermines the international obligations the United States has undertaken in preparing the peace treaty with Japan.

　　The U.S. government is trying to exclude the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other Allied countries from the preparatory work for the peace treaty with Japan, and single-handedly prepares and drafts the peace treaty with Japan, so as to take advantage of the current Japanese government's dependence on the U.S. occupation authorities to force Japan to accept treaty conditions favorable to the U.S. government by means of orders. Obviously, the current Japanese government, which is being used by the U.S. occupation authorities, cannot represent the free will of the Japanese people, and the treaty conditions that the U.S. government is forcing Japan to accept can only bring disaster to the Japanese people.

(II)

　　The Soviet government rightly points out that the content of the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan blatantly violates important international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration of 1943, the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945, and the Yalta Agreement of 1945.

　　Since the victory of the Allied countries in the war against Japan, the actions of the U.S. government have begun to undermine important international agreements of the Allied countries regarding policy towards Japan. According to the above-mentioned international agreements, the Allied countries authorized the U.S. military to occupy Japan, with the sole purpose of eliminating Japanese militarism and implementing the democratization of Japan; however, the policies pursued by the U.S. occupation authorities in Japan are to do everything possible to preserve Japanese militarism and prevent the democratization of Japan, and are therefore incompatible and illegal with the above-mentioned international agreements. The above-mentioned international agreements also clearly stipulated the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China and the freedom and independence of Korea; however, the U.S. government has illegally used Japanese territory, material resources, and manpower to carry out illegal armed intervention in Korea and illegal armed occupation of our country's Taiwan.

　　The U.S. government's draft treaty is an attempt to legalize this series of illegal acts.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China pointed out in its statement of December 4, 1950, that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have already been returned to China in accordance with the Cairo Declaration; there is absolutely no reason to re-discuss these already decided territorial issues. However, the U.S. draft only mentions that Japan renounces all rights to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but does not mention the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China. The purpose of the U.S. government is obviously to illegally occupy our country's Taiwan for a long time, and to use Taiwan as a military base to further invade our People's Republic of China. On the other hand, although no international agreement between any of the Allied countries has stipulated that the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, Nishinoshima, the Volcano Islands, Okinotori Island, and Minamitori Island should be included in the trusteeship system with the United States as the administering authority; the U.S. government openly proposes to hand over the above-mentioned islands to the United States for administration under the pretext of trusteeship by the United Nations, that is, to occupy them for its own use. The U.S. government's disregard for international law and its insistence on its ambition to invade and expand territory could not be more clearly demonstrated here.

　　The Chinese people have suffered the deepest from the aggression of militarist Japan, and their struggle against the Japanese aggressors has been the longest, and therefore their opposition to the revival of Japanese militarism is the most resolute; as is well known, the above-mentioned international agreements of the Allied countries on Japan have repeatedly mentioned the necessity of eliminating Japanese militarism. However, the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan provides no guarantee for preventing the revival of Japanese militarism, and no restrictions on the size of the Japanese armed forces. The purpose of the U.S. government is clearly not to eliminate Japanese militarism, but to restore Japanese militarism, to use Japanese territory as a base, and to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder, as a tool for the U.S. to continue and expand its aggression against Korea, China, and other countries in Asia.

　　But even so, the U.S. government does not intend to withdraw its occupying forces from Japan after the signing of the peace treaty; on the contrary, the U.S. government has now obtained the unlimited right to continue to occupy Japan indefinitely after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. The U.S. government is attempting to legalize the illegal occupation of Japan by the U.S. military, and to keep Japan in a state of long-term occupation.

　　It can be seen from this that the U.S. government's draft peace treaty with Japan, in terms of its content, completely violates the purpose of the Allied countries' war against Japan, undermines the Allied countries' international agreements on Japan, harms the interests of the Allied countries, and violates the will of the Japanese people. The U.S. government only pursues one central goal in this draft treaty, which is to revive Japanese militarism in order to continue and expand its acts of aggression against Asian countries, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and the hundreds of millions of people in Asia who have been invaded by militarist Japan.

(III)

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with and supports the specific suggestions made by the Soviet government regarding the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in complete agreement with the Soviet government, has consistently advocated that a joint peace treaty with Japan should be concluded as soon as possible on the basis of the main international agreements of the Allied countries on Japan, such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation; and that the preparation of the draft peace treaty with Japan should be carried out by representatives of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, with the participation of the member states of the Far Eastern Commission. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has more than once publicly criticized the U.S. government's conspiracy to repeatedly delay the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan since 1947, and its activities to repeatedly undermine the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and to engage in a separate peace with Japan since 1950. In order to guarantee the realization of this goal, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance of February 14, 1950, expressly stipulates: "The two countries of China and the Soviet Union guarantee, through mutual agreement with the other Allied countries during the Second World War, to jointly achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in the shortest possible time."

　　The Chinese people are the most resolute in opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, but they also sympathize most with the Japanese people's desire for peace, democracy, and national independence; the Chinese people deeply know that an independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan, free from external control, is an indispensable factor for peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the five main goals proposed by the Soviet government that a fair and reasonable peace treaty with Japan should follow on the basis of the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, namely:

　　"A. Japan should become a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country;

　　B. The democratic rights of the Japanese people should be guaranteed, and the existence of any political, military, or militarized organizations aimed at depriving the people of their democratic rights should not be allowed, as stipulated in the peace treaty with Italy;

　　C. In order to ensure that Japanese militarism does not revive, the treaty should set limits on the size of the Japanese armed forces so that these armed forces do not exceed the requirements of self-defense, as stipulated in the peace treaty with Italy;

　　D. No restrictions should be placed on the peaceful economic development of Japan;

　　E. All restrictions should be lifted on trade relations between Japan and other countries."

　　In order to concretely guarantee the realization of the above-mentioned main goals, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with and supports the Soviet government's proposal that the treaty should include provisions on Japan's not joining alliances aimed at opposing any of the Allied countries, and on the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Japan no more than one year after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, and that no foreign country should maintain troops or military bases in Japan, as well as the proposal that the signatory countries of the treaty should jointly support Japan's accession to the United Nations organization.

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has always believed that the peaceful handling of the Japanese issue is a major key to solving the current problems in the Far East, and that the work of concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan has become a matter of utmost urgency; therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the Soviet government's proposal: "In June or July 1951, a meeting of foreign ministers organized by representatives of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union should be convened to begin preparing for a peace treaty with Japan, and attention should be paid to the participation of representatives of all countries that have participated in the war against Japan with armed forces in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, so that the draft treaty can be submitted to the peace conference for review."

　　I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Your Excellency Ambassador the expression of my highest consideration.

　　To His Excellency Mr. Roschin, Soviet Ambassador to China

　　Minister Zhou Enlai

　　周外长照会苏大使
    支持苏联政府对日和约意见及对和约准备工作具体建议
    【新华社二十四日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部于五月九日经由苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻华大使馆，收到苏联政府递交美利坚合众国政府的照会副本一件。我国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长为此于五月二十二日照会苏联驻华大使罗申称，中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见及其关于准备对日和约的具体建议。照会全文如下：大使先生：
    我荣幸地通知您，五月九日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部，经由苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻华大使馆，收到苏联政府递交美利坚合众国政府的照会副本一件，其中历述苏联政府对于美国对日和约草案的意见。中华人民共和国中央人民政府对此表示谢意。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府在其一九五零年十二月四日的声明中即已指出：美国政府自一九四七年以来，屡次企图颠倒对日和约的程序，破坏对日和约应先经由中苏英美四国外长会议共同讨论准备的原则。中华人民共和国从未准备，也决不准备考虑任何一国政府单独拟制的对日和约草案。
    自一九三一年九月十八日以来，日本帝国主义武装侵略我国广大领土，使我国人民生命财产遭受重大牺牲。中国人民经过八年英勇抗战，击败日本帝国主义取得抗日战争的胜利。因此，我中华人民共和国必须参加对日和约的准备、拟制与签订，乃属天经地义之事。但美国政府竟妄自企图排除我中华人民共和国——中国人民唯一合法的代表者于对日和约的准备工作之外，这是对于中国人民一宗莫大的侮辱，中国人民绝对不能容忍，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已经不止一次的声明：对日和约的准备、拟制与签订，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容与结果如何都将是非法的，从而也是无效的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府详细研究了苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见之后，认为苏联政府的意见与中华人民共和国中央人民政府的意见，完全符合；因此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见及其关于准备对日和约的具体建议。
            （一）
    在准备对日和约的程序问题上，苏联政府完全正当地提出对日和约的准备不能作为任何一国政府的任务，不能让任何一国政府单独拟制对日和约草案来咨询有关各国政府的意见，而应作为有关各国政府的共同任务；而根据波茨坦协定，对日和约之拟制应由美英中苏四国进行，并由其他有关各国参加。但美国政府一意孤行，竟单独准备对日和约草案，以咨询有关各国政府为名，强迫其他盟国予以接受；这就破坏了美国对于准备对日和约所承担的国际义务。
    美国政府力图将中华人民共和国、苏联及其他盟国排斥于对日和约的准备工作之外，而一手包办对日和约的准备与拟制，以便利用现时日本政府对美国占领当局的依赖性，以命令方式强使日本接受有利于美国政府的和约条件。很显然，现时被美国占领当局所利用的日本政府不能代表日本人民的自由意志，而美国政府强使日本接受的和约条件只能带给日本人民以灾难。
            （二）
    苏联政府完全正当地指出美国对日和约草案的内容，彰明较著地破坏了一九四三年的开罗宣言，一九四五年的波茨坦公告及一九四五年的雅尔达协定等重要国际协定。
    早从盟国对日战争胜利时起，美国政府的行动就已开始破坏盟国有关对日政策的重要国际协定。根据上述国际协定，盟国授权美军占领日本，其目的仅限于肃清日本军国主义及实行日本的民主化；但美国占领当局在日本所推行的政策却是竭力保存日本的军国主义与阻止日本的民主化，因此，是与上述国际协定不相容的，非法的。上述国际协定同样明确地规定了台湾与澎湖群岛的归还中国和朝鲜的自由独立；但美国政府却非法利用日本的领土、物质资源及人力对朝鲜进行了非法的武装干涉，对我国台湾进行了非法的武装占领。
    美国政府的和约草案就是企图将它这一系列的非法行为加以合法化。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府早在其一九五零年十二月四日的声明中指出，关于台湾与澎湖列岛，业已依照开罗宣言规定归还中国；这些已经决定了的领土问题，完全没有重新讨论的理由。但美国的草案却只谈到日本放弃对台湾及澎湖列岛的一切权利，而关于将台湾及澎湖列岛归还中国一事，却只字不提。美国政府的目的显然是企图长期非法占领我国台湾，并以台湾为军事基地，进一步侵略我中华人民共和国。另一方面，尽管任何盟国间的国际协定都不曾规定琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、西之岛、琉璜群岛、冲之鸟岛和南鸟岛应列入以美国为管理当局的托管制度；美国政府却公然提出以由联合国托管为借口，将上述诸岛交由美国管理，即由其占为己有。美国政府目无国际法纪，坚持侵略与扩张领土的野心再没有比在这里表现得更清楚的了。
    中国人民遭受军国主义日本的侵略最深，反抗日本侵略者的斗争最久，从而反对日本军国主义的复活也最坚决；如所周知，上述盟国对日国际协定曾不止一次地提到肃清日本军国主义的必要。但美国对日和约草案对于防止日本军国主义的复活，毫无保证，对于日本武装力量的规模，毫无限制。美国政府的目的显然不是肃清日本军国主义而是恢复日本军国主义，以日本国土为基地，以日本人民为炮灰，作为美国继续并扩大侵略朝鲜、中国和亚洲各国的工具。
    但虽然如此，美国政府并不打算在和约签订后从日本撤出它的占领军；相反，美国政府现在已经取得在对日和约签订之后无限期地继续占领日本的无限权利。美国政府企图将美国军队非法占领日本一事予以合法化，使日本处于长期被占领的状态下。
    由此可见，美国政府的对日和约草案，就其内容说，是完全违反盟国对日作战的目的，破坏盟国对日的国际协定，损害同盟国家的利益，违背日本人民的意志的。美国政府在这个和约草案中只追求一个中心目的，就是复活日本军国主义，以继续并扩大其对亚洲各国的侵略行为，这是中国人民和所有曾经被军国主义日本侵略的亚洲亿万人民所绝对不能容忍的。
            （三）
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全同意并支持苏联政府所提出的关于准备对日和约的具体建议。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府，和苏联政府完全一致，历来主张，应在开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告等盟国对日的主要国际协定的基础上，在尽可能的短期内，缔结共同对日和约；而对日和约草案之准备则应由苏联、中华人民共和国、美国、英国四国代表进行，并由远东委员会各会员国参与其事。中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾不止一次地公开指摘美国政府自一九四七年以来一再拖延缔结全面对日和约的阴谋以及一九五零年以来一再破坏缔结全面对日和约而进行单独对日媾和的活动。为保证此目的之实现，一九五零年二月十四日中苏友好同盟互助条约，曾明文规定：中苏两国“保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结”。
    中国人民反对日本军国主义的复活最坚决，但对于日本人民要求和平、民主与国家独立的愿望也最同情；中国人民深知，一个没有外力控制的独立的民主的爱好和平的日本是亚洲与世界的和平所不可缺少的因素。因此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全赞成苏联政府所提出的，在开罗宣言、波茨坦公告及雅尔达协定的基础上，一个公平合理的对日和约所应遵循的五项主要目标，即：
    “甲、日本应成为爱好和平的、民主的、独立的国家；
    乙、应保证日本人民的民主权利，并不得允许以剥夺人民民主权利为目的的，无论是政治的、军事的或军事化的组织之存在，与对意大利和约中所规定者相同；
    丙、为保证日本军国主义之不复活，在条约内应确定对日本武装力量规模之限制，使此等武装力量不超越自卫之要求。与在对意大利和约中所规定者相同；
    丁、对日本和平经济之发展，不应加以任何限制；
    戊、在日本和其他国家的贸易关系上，应取消一切限制。”
    为具体保证上述主要目标之实现，中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全同意并支持苏联政府所提出的在和约中应有关于日本不得加入旨在反对任何盟国的同盟的规定和关于在对日和约签字后最多不得超过一年自日本撤退一切占领军以及任何外国不得在日本保有军队或军事基地的规定以及和约签字国应共同支持日本加入联合国组织的提议。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府一贯认为和平处理日本问题是解决目前远东各项问题的一个重大关键，缔结全面对日和约的工作已成刻不容缓之事，因此中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全赞成苏联政府的提议：“在一九五一年六月或七月，召开美、中、英、苏四国代表组织的外长会议，着手筹备对日和约，并应顾及使所有曾以武力参加对日战争之各国代表参与制定对日和约的筹备工作，以便将和约草案提交和会审议之”。
    顺向大使先生致以崇高之敬意。
