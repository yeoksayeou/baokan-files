A Good Way to Promote Advanced Experience
　　Shenyang Rolling Stock Depot Studies Soviet Experience
　　Trials Advanced Work Method Training Classes

　　Shenyang Rolling Stock Depot, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet "Stakhanov Schools," is piloting "Advanced Work Method Training Classes" to enable workers in the same jobs to quickly master advanced work methods.

　　The purpose of these training classes is to promote advanced work methods. Advanced workers sign contracts with the heads of their units to teach advanced work methods to workers in the same jobs within a certain period, so that they can also use advanced work methods and improve work efficiency. On February 17 this year, the Shenyang Rolling Stock Depot selected the oil line group and the train inspection group as pilot projects. Zhao Ruilan, an advanced worker, was selected as the lecturer for the oil line group, with three trainees. Zhang Hanjiang, an advanced worker, was selected as the lecturer for the train inspection group, with four trainees. Both groups hired engineers as consultants. During the training, the lecturers used a combination of theoretical explanation and practical demonstration to teach, and supervised the trainees' use of advanced work methods, correcting errors at any time. After the training classes were established, all trainees learned to use advanced work methods in only one month. According to technical inspection results, the work efficiency of the three trainees in the oil line group increased by 135 to 177 percent compared to the original. The scraper tile work of the train inspection group was shortened from 35 minutes to 18 minutes, and the replacement of brake shoes was shortened from 15 minutes to 7 minutes. The quality of work of the two groups of trainees has also improved significantly. This experiment proves that advanced work method training classes are a good way to promote advanced work methods. It can promote an advanced work method to every worker in the same job in the shortest time.

　　推广先进经验的好办法
    沈阳检车段学习苏联经验
    试办先进工作方法训练班
    沈阳检车段学习苏联“斯塔哈诺夫学校”的先进经验，试办“先进工作方法训练班”，使先进工作方法很快地为同样工作者所掌握。
    这种训练班是以推广先进工作方法为目的，由先进工作者与本单位首长订立合同，在一定期间将先进工作方法传授给同样工作者，使他们也能同样运用先进工作方法，提高工作效率。沈阳检车段在今年二月十七日选定油线组和列车检查组作为试点。油线组以先进工作者赵瑞兰为讲师，学员三名。列车检查组以先进工作者张汉江为讲师，学员四名。两组都聘请工程师为顾问。在训练中，讲师用理论讲解和实际表演相结合的方法教学，并在学员使用先进工作法工作时施行监督，随时纠正错误。训练班成立后，只一个月，全部学员都已学会运用先进工作方法。根据技术检查结果，油线组三名学员的工作效率较原来提高了百分之一百三十五到一百七十七。列车检查组刮瓦工作由以前的三十五分钟缩短到十八分钟，更换闸瓦从十五分钟缩短到七分钟。两组学员工作的质量也有显著提高。这次试验证明先进工作方法训练班是推广先进工作方法的好方法，它可以在最短时间内把一种先进工作方法推行到每个同样工作者中间去。
