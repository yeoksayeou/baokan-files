    Our Great Motherland
    Today is the 26th anniversary of the May 30th Anti-Imperialist Movement. The May 30th Movement greatly advanced the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people at that time and prepared the political conditions for the Northern Expedition. This is a scene of workers, students, and citizens in Beijing holding a meeting in front of Tiananmen Square and holding a large demonstration against imperialism after the "May 30th" massacre in Shanghai. The people's revolutionary struggle twenty-six years ago did not achieve a fundamental victory until the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    我们伟大的祖国
    今天是“五卅”反帝国主义运动二十六周年纪念日。“五卅”运动曾把当时我国人民革命斗争大大地向前推进了一步，为北伐战争准备了政治的条件。这是上海“五卅”惨案发生后，北京工人、学生和市民在天安门前开会，并举行反对帝国主义大示威的情形。二十六年前的人民革命斗争，直到中华人民共和国成立才得到了基本上的胜利。
