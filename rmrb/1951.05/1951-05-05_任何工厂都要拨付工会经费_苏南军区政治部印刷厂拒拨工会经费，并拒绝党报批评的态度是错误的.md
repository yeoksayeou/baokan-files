　　Any Factory Must Allocate Trade Union Funds; The Refusal of the Political Department Printing Factory of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region to Allocate Trade Union Funds and Its Rejection of Criticism from the Party Newspaper is Wrong
Editor:
    The administrative leaders of the Political Department Printing Factory of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region disregard national laws and fail to implement the Trade Union Law. They have been slow to address the criticism from the Party newspaper. We believe this attitude is wrong and should be strictly examined and promptly corrected.
    The facts are as follows:
    Since its establishment in August last year, the trade union of the Political Department Printing Factory of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region has legally requested the factory's administration to allocate trade union funds. The administrative officer of the factory said: "We are a military factory, and the Trade Union Law does not apply here." In October of last year, the trade union again requested the administration to allocate funds according to the law. The administration impatiently gave 30,000 yuan and then extracted another 30,000 yuan from the employee meal expenses (note: it is wrong to extract funds from employee meal expenses for trade union funds - editor). After that, no further funds were given. The Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office issued a directive on January 12, instructing all public and private enterprises to allocate trade union funds, stating: "...It is hereby stipulated that all public and private enterprises and other production units or administrative units shall, from July 1950, pay in accordance with the prescribed amount. Those who have not paid or have paid insufficiently in the past shall make up the payment immediately..." Therefore, Tang Kai, a trade union cadre of the factory, requested the administration to reissue the trade union funds for last year. As a result, he was reprimanded by the factory director, who said: "Your trade union only knows how to ask for money. What Trade Union Law? Then go to the military region leaders to get it." In order to help the administrative comrades of the factory recognize and correct this error, the trade union specifically criticized this illegal phenomenon in the Southern Jiangsu Daily on February 13. The editor of the Southern Jiangsu Daily solemnly pointed out in the editor's note: The Political Department of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region should conduct an inspection of this matter and publish the inspection results and the handling situation in the newspaper. However, to this day, the problem has not been resolved. As far as we know, the attitude of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region on this issue is: We are a military unit, and whether this expense can be reimbursed needs to be referred to higher authorities. Therefore, the problem has been dragged on. We hope that the relevant departments can thoroughly investigate this matter as soon as possible so that the problem can be resolved at an early date.

    Editor's note: The Trade Union Law is one of the fundamental laws of the country, and the administrative side or capitalists of any factory, mine, shop, rural area, office, school, and other production units or administrative units should unconditionally implement it. The administrative officials of the Political Department Printing Factory of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region dared to despise the Trade Union Law and did not attach importance to the trade union organization. This attitude is wrong. After being publicly criticized in the Southern Jiangsu Daily, the administrative officers of the factory ignored it. This attitude is even more wrong. We hope that the Political Department of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region will assist and urge the factory to conduct an inspection and correction, and inform us of the results.

　　任何工厂都要拨付工会经费
    苏南军区政治部印刷厂拒拨工会经费，并拒绝党报批评的态度是错误的编辑同志：
    苏南军区政治部印刷厂行政领导干部，漠视国家法令，不执行工会法；对党报的批评，迟迟不予处理。我们认为这种态度是错误的，应该进行严格的检查，并迅速改正。
    事实是这样的：
    苏南军区政治部印刷厂工会自去年八月成立后，即依法向该厂行政要求拨交工会经费。该厂行政负责干部说：“我们是军队的工厂，工会法在这里行不通。”去年十月间，工会再度要求行政依法拨给经费。行政很不耐烦地给了三万元，又在职工伙食中抽出三万元（按：从职工伙食中抽款作工会经费是错误的——编者），此后即分文不给。苏南人民行政公署曾于一月十二日，指令各公私营企业拨交工会经费，通令称：“……今特规定各公私营企业等生产单位或行政单位，应自一九五○年七月份起，一律按照规定款额缴纳，其以前尚未缴纳或缴纳不足者应即补缴……”因此，该厂工会干部唐凯即向行政方面要求补发去年工会的经费。结果遭到该厂厂长一顿责备，他说：“你们工会只会要钱。什么工会法规定的？那你到军区首长那里去拿好了。”工会为了帮助该厂行政负责同志认识并改正这一错误，特在二月十三日的苏南日报上，对于这种非法现象进行批评。苏南日报编者在按语中郑重地提出：苏南军区政治部对这件事应进行检查，并将检查结果与处理情形在报上公布。但时至今日，问题还没有解决。据我们所知，苏南军区对这个问题的态度是：我们是部队机关，这笔费用能不能报销，还得请示上级。因此，问题就这样拖下来了。我们希望有关部门能迅速地彻查这件事，使问题早日获得解决。

    编者按：工会法是国家的根本大法之一，任何工厂、矿场、商店、农村、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方，都应无条件地执行。苏南军区政治部印刷厂的行政负责干部竟敢藐视工会法，不重视工会组织，这种态度是错误的。在苏南日报公开批评后，该厂行政负责干部竟置之不理，这种态度更是错误的。我们希望苏南军区政治部协助并督促该厂进行检查和纠正，并将结果告诉我们。
