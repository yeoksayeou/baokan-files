　　New Patriotic Record Movement in Fengfeng Coal Mine
　　 Chao Qi
    The Laboring People Are Truly Glorious

    In March, the villages at the foot of Gulou Mountain were constantly stirred by heroic deeds from the production front. These news items, like the victories coming from Korea, were increasingly exciting and made people feel that the creativity of workers who have mastered advanced technology is boundless!

    A new piece of news spread: Luo Yongjin, a pneumatic drill operator from the No. 510 working face of the Second Mine, following Zhao Wenxin, a pneumatic drill operator from the No. 506 working face of the First Mine who had created a new record of 243 tons, created a new national record of 254 tons for coal mining at the time. As a result, streams of people converged on the Second Mine from all directions. Workers came, staff members came, the Handan Special District Cultural Troupe came, engineers, the director of the Mining Bureau, the Party Committee Secretary, the Chairman of the Mining Area People's Government, the Chairman of the Trade Union, the Secretary of the Communist Youth League... all came. As Luo Yongjin and his group of workers came out of the pit, people shouted "Learn from Luo Yongjin!" The slogan echoed through Gulou Mountain.

    Breaking Through the Gates Blocking Progress

    As early as the end of last year, the Fengfeng Coal Mine began to use the "downward inclined layered caving longwall retreating method" (referred to as "downward layered caving method") for coal mining, as suggested by Soviet experts, creating favorable conditions for fully utilizing the efficiency of pneumatic drill coal mining. In the 40-50 meter long mining pits, workers were already using electric locks to drill and blast, and using hand picks or pneumatic drills (initially) to split coal. The 60-meter long electric chute continuously rotated, scooping eight or nine tons of coal into the coal trucks in the main roadway within ten minutes. Air flowed along the working face. Neatly stacked wooden supports and duckbill canopies stood side by side, firmly supporting the roof and ensuring the safe production of miners. Workers who had been digging coal in small kilns for a long time couldn't help but happily shout: "No more being four-legged people (meaning crawling and pushing carts)!"

    However, due to the workers' lack of technical proficiency, there were opinions against using pneumatic drills. Some said that using pneumatic drills was too tiring, as they weighed twelve pounds and were very bulky, not as light and quick as using clumsy (hand) picks. In the initial trial use of pneumatic drills, the mechanical and electrical workers did not coordinate well with the pneumatic drill operators, and the pneumatic drills could not be repaired in time when they broke; the air belts also leaked, the air pressure was insufficient, and the air supply time was not fixed. Therefore, the efficiency of pneumatic drills never exceeded eighteen tons. So some workers sarcastically said: "We are racing with clumsy picks against pneumatic drills!" Most workers complained that the pneumatic drills were too noisy, "beeping" like motorcycles, making it impossible to hear people talking or to hear rocks falling from the roof. In short, they felt that clumsy picks were safer. In addition, a few more backward workers were afraid that increasing efficiency with pneumatic drills would lead to revisions of quotas and reduce the calculated unit price, so they were even less willing to use pneumatic drills.

    Among the leading cadres, there was also a general underestimation of the effectiveness of pneumatic drills, believing that "it's good to use pneumatic drills, but it's okay not to use them!" When the record of more than 200 tons created by the Huainan Coal Mine using pneumatic drills was reported, some cadres said: "The coal seam in Huainan is soft, our coal seam is hard, the conditions are different." Some doubted and said: "It's not possible even if you're cutting tofu!"

    This ideological gate tightly blocked the road forward.

    However, the torrent of the surging movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea broke through this gate. In the high tide of the nationwide patriotic production competition movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the leading cadres reviewed the main reasons why coal mining efficiency could not be greatly improved: the mechanical efficiency was not fully utilized, and efforts to improve technology were insufficient. When Liu Xiangsan, Director of the National Coal Mine Administration, came to inspect the work, he also repeatedly pointed out the importance of pneumatic drill coal mining and introduced the achievements of Shandong and Huainan, helping the leading cadres to understand the situation.

    "How to improve efficiency and reduce costs?" This issue was heatedly discussed at the expanded Management Committee of the Mining Bureau and the Chinese Communist Party Representatives Conference in February, and the conclusion was reached that pneumatic drills must be used for coal mining. To improve the efficiency of pneumatic drills, there were three main links: first, to remove the workers' ideological obstacles to using pneumatic drills; second, the pneumatic drill operators must master the technology; and third, the pneumatic drill operators, coal loading workers, carpenters, and mechanical and electrical workers must closely cooperate and be consistent. Removing the workers' ideological obstacles was approached from two aspects: first, by launching a grievance campaign to increase patriotic production enthusiasm; and second, by making a breakthrough at one point and achieving results. Therefore, it was decided to start the trial implementation from the No. 506 working face of the First Mine.

    After liberation, with the gradual increase in production, the lives of the workers in the Fengfeng Coal Mine have also greatly improved. The average worker can get five or six hundred catties of millet per month. The 20,000 square meters of workers' dormitories, canteens, bathhouses, rest rooms, and hospitals have also been completed. When the workers moved furniture into their new dormitories, many elderly family members shed tears of joy, saying with emotion: "I never thought I would live in a new house in my lifetime!" Children attend workers' children's schools for free. Miners also attend spare-time schools to learn culture. Especially after the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the workers have been liberated from the worries of death and disease and have seen the prospect of a better life in the future. After launching the grievance campaign, the workers made a clear comparison between the happy life after liberation and the days interwoven with blood and tears before liberation. The workers made up their minds: never let the American devils come and destroy our good life! Pneumatic drill operator Zhao Wenxin said: "The volunteers are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves in Korea, what are we afraid of?" He proposed: "The working face is the battlefield, the pneumatic drill is the weapon, one more ton of coal produced is one more American devil eliminated!" This is the miners' competition oath.

  Leaping Forward in Exploration

    March 8th was the day before the start of the pneumatic drill record-breaking movement. The Deputy Director of the Mining Bureau and the Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee personally went to the First Mine to help with the work. The No. 506 working face, designated as the key experimental area, selected seventeen strong, hardworking, politically conscious, and somewhat technically skilled workers as pneumatic drill shock troops.

    This was a meeting to study how to create new records. The heads of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, as well as technical personnel, were all present. Guo Yawei, Director of the Coal Mining Department, personally taught the workers the structure of the pneumatic drill. The workers had some confidence in their hearts. However, the entire working face of pneumatic drill coal mining was like a living machine, and the pneumatic drill operators alone could not solve the problem, but also required the cooperation of other workers. Therefore, the leaders launched a campaign to sign liaison contracts.

    Workers who have mastered advanced technology are advancing in leaps and bounds. As a result, the first shot broke through the leaders' estimates. New records appeared one after another. Li Guangzheng of the early shift on the 9th created a record of 37.18 tons in four and a half hours. This greatly improved the miners' confidence in using pneumatic drills for coal mining, and also surprised the leading cadres, because the leaders planned to reach 37 tons by March 15th and strive to catch up with Shandong's record of 60 tons by the end of the month. On the 13th, the news of Huainan Xinzhuangzi's pneumatic drill coal mining reaching 215 tons was transmitted to Fengfeng, which further encouraged everyone. Each pneumatic drill team held group meetings to study improvement methods and strive to catch up with Huainan's record. On the 14th, Yang Wuchang of the middle shift dug 60 tons, on the 15th, Zhao Wenxin dug 74 tons, and then Zhang Guanggui dug 104 tons, catching up with Stakhanov's first new record. This new record caused a sensation throughout the mine. Red bulletin slogans were posted everywhere, and large-character victory reports were distributed to every corner of the mine. The next day, Shen Yongyuan of the middle shift created a new record of 114 tons. On the 17th, news came that Ma Jinyu, a pneumatic drill operator from the No. 510 working face of the Second Mine, created a new record of 138 tons. The already unsettled First Mine was now even more agitated. The poster written in red pen with "138 tons!" was posted squarely on the wall of the First Mine's pit entrance, as if challenging everyone. The pneumatic drill operators asked in astonishment: "What's going on! Our First Mine is the eldest brother, and our No. 506 working face is the key experimental area of the whole mine, and the Second Mine has caught up!" It turned out that the workers of the Second Mine had been holding their breath when they heard the news of the First Mine's new record in pneumatic drill coal mining. After getting the support and help of the leaders, they also organized three teams and quietly started working on the No. 510 working face.

    Under the leadership of the trade union in the First Mine, each group held a meeting to study how to catch up with the Second Mine. As soon as the slogan "Catch up with the Second Mine's 138-ton record" was posted, Yang Ercheng created 151 tons. Then, on the morning shift of the 19th, Zhang Jinshan created a new record of 160 tons. At this time, the workers' emotions were even higher, and they were more confident in catching up with the Huainan record. Therefore, the leaders put forward the slogan "Catch up with the new Huainan record and aim for Stakhanov's second new record (227 tons)!"

    The pneumatic drill operators of the No. 506 working face have three teams. Since breaking the 100-ton record, the second team has not created any new records. Zhao Wenxin was in this team and felt very frustrated. Especially after the Second Mine created the 138-ton record, the young and naughty co-workers stimulated Zhao Wenxin to his face, saying: "The second team has fallen behind!" Zhao Wenxin felt hot in his heart. No matter how tired he was at work, he couldn't sleep, tossing and turning, thinking about this and that. Suddenly, he remembered the method mentioned by the Director of the Coal Mining Department: first dig a groove from the bottom, and then mine obliquely downward according to the coal's cleavage (grain), which is both labor-saving and fast. He also went to ask Zhang Guanggui and Yang Ercheng, who both said that this method was the best. On the 19th, he called a meeting of the workers in the team, explained the technical principles clearly, and then said: "How about we create a 200-ton record tonight?" The workers said: "Not high enough!" and firmly stated: As long as you can move forward, we guarantee to keep up! That night, the second team launched a frenzied competition. Wherever Zhao Wenxin's pneumatic drill went, the carpenters would erect the roof support there; the coal loading workers scooped the coal into the electric chute with a swoosh; the mechanical and electrical workers never left the pneumatic drill operators, and immediately checked and repaired it as soon as they heard an unusual sound. Finally, in seven hours and two minutes, they successfully created a new record of 243 tons!

    Following this, Luo Yongjin of the Second Mine, with the close cooperation of the workers and the encouragement of the leading cadres, created the highest record of 254 tons.

  Every Road Leads to Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea

    "Every road leads to resisting US aggression and aiding Korea!" This is a combat slogan put forward by the Fengfeng Mining Bureau after the pneumatic drill coal mining created a new record.

    In the entire patriotic production competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the pneumatic drill coal mining record-breaking movement, like a locomotive, has driven many other tasks. Everyone is determined to thoroughly cleanse the black spots in their work in the torrent of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. The staff in the organs launched a four-anti (anti-bureaucracy, anti-red tape, anti-paralysis, anti-dragging) and three-no-mistakes (no wrong numbers, no wrong times, no wrong handling) movement. The Chairman of the Trade Union of the mining area organs told me a story: A department sent a budget form for review. After many procedures, each handler approved "agree" on the official document, but it was not completed until the budget form disappeared. The statistics room and the typing room used to have "decimal point moving" incidents, but now the number of typos has been reduced to 0.06 per thousand. The planning office in the past had no plans, "the top is dying of work, the bottom is dying of idleness!" This is their own summary of the past work situation. Now, everyone has made their own plans and achieved "today's business, finished today." The grassroots cadres launched a three-diligent (diligent hands, diligent feet, diligent mouth) movement. Technical personnel went deep into the front line and studied technology with the workers. Accountants who had previously stayed at checking account numbers personally went down the pit to understand the production process and help do anti-US aggression and aid Korea propaganda work in order to do a good job in "zonal daily cost calculation." Mechanical and electrical workers launched a six-no-leak (no leak of coal, steam, water, wind, oil, electricity) movement against waste. Before this, the boiler room of the power plant was "squeaking and chirping" with steam all day long; the machine room, pump room, and turbine room were covered in oil. Since the workers launched the six-no-leak movement, the oil leak phenomenon has been eliminated, and the machines have been polished brightly. The boiler has never leaked steam once, and the transporters also guarantee that the chimney does not emit black smoke and there is no coal residue in the furnace ash, saving more than 80,000 kilograms of coal per month!

    While increasing production, the miners also launched a patriotic movement to reduce the consumption of pit wood per ton of coal. Reducing the consumption of pit wood per ton is the main link in reducing costs. The workers themselves proposed: "Taking out one more piece of wood will save the country sixty catties of rice!" On the night of March 23rd, workers Sun Xiangyin, Liu Yugui, etc., in order to welcome the Secretary of the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Commissioner, created a new record of 100% wood support recovery rate and 99% canopy recovery rate (the highest in the past was 80%) in four hours. On the 29th, they created a new record of 0.0093 cubic meters of pit wood consumption per ton of coal, which is only equivalent to 15% of the past, reducing the working face cost per ton of coal from 35,700 yuan to 8,000 yuan. The workers' patriotic enthusiasm is unimaginable. I personally saw a worker painstakingly taking out a wooden pillar buried in the collapsed roof. When he pulled out the wooden pillar, he said with excitement: "Another sixty catties of rice saved for the country!"

  Create! Create Again!

    The fiery pneumatic drill coal mining record-breaking movement in the Fengfeng Coal Mine is steadily developing into an in-depth stage. When I visited the No. 506 working face, the workers were preparing for the new record-breaking work of lower-level pneumatic drill coal mining according to the suggestions of Soviet experts. Lower-level pneumatic drill coal mining is more difficult than upper-level. Moreover, lower-level pneumatic drill coal mining is a new thing in the country, with no successful experience to learn from and no lessons from failure to borrow. However, Chinese workers who have mastered new technologies will certainly be able to overcome these difficulties and move forward. I once asked pneumatic drill operators Zhang Guanggui, Zhao Wenxin, and Luo Yongjin: "Are you confident in creating new records in lower-level pneumatic drill coal mining?" They all answered affirmatively with full confidence: "Watch it! We have already started on cyclic operations. As long as we find some rules, we will start." When the miners heard that the Huainan Jiulonggang Coal Mine had created a collective efficiency of 7.85 tons (Note: The highest in the Fengfeng Coal Mine is 4.2 tons), they immediately held a meeting to discuss it and made a plan: to improve the collective efficiency of the working face to a record of 10 tons, and pneumatic drill coal mining must break the 300-ton record!

    Let us wish the heroes new victories!

　　爱国主义新纪录运动在峰峰煤矿
     超祺
    劳动人民真光荣
    三月里，鼓峰山下的村庄，不断地被生产战线上的英雄事迹激荡着。这些消息像从朝鲜传来的捷报一样，一次比一次地令人兴奋，一次比一次地令人感到：掌握了先进技术的工人，其创造力是无穷的！
    一个新消息又传出来了：二矿五一○掌子的风镐手罗永金，继一矿五○六掌子面的风镐手赵文信创二百四十三吨的新纪录后，创了二百五十四吨的当时的全国最高采煤新纪录。于是，一股股的人流从四面八方向二矿汇集。工人来了，职员来了，邯郸专区文工团来了，工程师、矿务局局长、党委书记、矿区人民政府主席、工会主席、青年团书记……都来了。当着罗永金和他那组的工人从坑里上来的时候，人们高呼“向罗永金学习！”的口号，鼓峰山都被震动了。
    冲破阻碍前进的闸门
    早在去年年底，峰峰煤矿就开始采用苏联专家建议的“下行倾斜分层陷落长壁后退法”（简称“下行分层陷落法”）采煤，创造了充分发挥风镐采煤效率的有利条件。在四、五十米长的采煤坑里，工人们已经使用电锁打眼放炮，并用手镐或风镐（开始用）劈煤。六十米长的电溜子不断地回旋着，在十分钟内即可把八、九吨煤括到大巷的运煤车里。空气顺着掌子面流动。架得整整齐齐的木垛和鸭嘴棚并排屹立着，稳固地支撑着顶板，保障矿工安全生产。长期在小窑洞里刨煤的工人不禁高兴地喊道：“不要再做四条腿的人（意即爬下推筐）了！”
    可是，由于工人技术不熟练，对于使用风镐都有意见。有的说，用风镐太累，它有十二磅重，又很粗，不如使笨（手）镐轻快。在最初试用风镐时，机电工人对风镐手配合得不好，风镐坏了不能及时修理；风带也漏风，风压不够，供风时间也不定，因此，风镐效率始终没有超过十八吨。所以有些工人讥讽地说：“我们拿笨镐和风镐比赛！”大部分工人都嫌风镐响声太大，“拔拔”地像摩托卡一样，讲话声音听不到，顶板岩石掉下来也听不到。总之，他们觉得没有笨镐保险。另外，有少数比较落后的工人，怕风镐提高效率后修改定额，减低计算单价，更不愿使用风镐。
    在领导干部里面，也普遍的对风镐效能估计不足，认为“使用风镐也好，但不用也可以！”当淮南煤矿使用风镐，创造二百多吨的纪录传来时，还有的干部说：“人家淮南煤层软，咱的煤层硬，条件不一样。”有的则怀疑地说：“就是切豆腐也不可能呀！”
    这道思想上的闸门，紧紧地把前进的道路堵住了。
    但是，澎湃的抗美援朝爱国运动的巨流，冲破了这道闸门。领导干部在全国开展的抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛运动的高潮中，检讨了采煤效率不能大大提高的主要原因，是：没有充分发挥机械效能，对改进技术努力不够。全国煤矿管理总局刘向三局长来检查工作时，也再三指出风镐采煤的重要性，并介绍了山东、淮南的成绩，帮助领导干部搞通了思想。
    “怎样提高效率，降低成本？”在二月的矿务局扩大管理委员会和中国共产党党代表会上，都热烈地讨论了这个问题，得到必须用风镐采煤的结论。要提高风镐效率，有三个主要环节：首先解除工人对使用风镐的思想障碍；其次是风镐手要掌握技术；其三是风镐手、撩煤工、木工和机电工要密切配合，协同一致。解除工人的思想障碍从两方面入手：首先是展开诉苦运动，提高爱国主义生产热忱；其次是突破一点，做出成绩。于是决定从一矿的五○六掌子开始试行。
    解放后的峰峰煤矿，随着生产量的逐渐提高，工人的生活也大大改善了。一般工人每月可以拿到五、六百斤小米。两万平方米的工人宿舍、食堂、澡塘、休息室、医院也已经落成了。当工人们把家具搬入新宿舍的时候，许多年老的家属喜欢得流下泪来，他们感动地说：“想不到这一辈子也住上新房子！”孩子们免费入工人子弟学校。矿工也上业余学校学文化。特别是劳动保险条例颁布以后，工人们已从死亡和疾病的忧虑中解放出来，并且看到了未来美好生活的远景。展开诉苦运动以后，工人们在回忆中，把解放后幸福的生活和解放前血泪交织着的日子作了鲜明的对比。工人们下了决心：决不让美国鬼子来破坏我们的好生活！风镐手赵文信说：“志愿军在朝鲜流血牺牲，我们怕啥？”他提出：“掌子面就是战场，风镐就是武器，多出一吨煤，就是多消灭一个美国鬼子！”这就是矿工们的竞赛誓言。
  在摸索中跃进
    三月八日，这是开始风镐创新纪录运动的前一天。矿务局副局长和中国共产党党委会副书记亲自到一矿帮助工作。被指定为试验重点的五○六掌子选出了十七位身强力壮的、能吃苦耐劳的、政治觉悟较高的并稍有技术水平的工人为突击风镐手。
    这是一个研究怎样创造新纪录的会议。党、行政、工会、青年团的负责人和技术人员都到了场。采煤处处长郭亚卫亲自把风镐的构造教给工人。工人们心里有了些底。可是，整个掌子面的风镐采煤，像一部活的机器一样，光是风镐手也不能解决问题，还需其他工人配合得好。于是领导上又发动订立了联系合同。
    掌握了先进技术的工人是以跃进的方式前进的。结果，第一炮就突破了领导干部的估计。新的纪录一个接着一个出现。九日早班李广政在四小时半内，首创三十七点一八吨纪录。这大大提高了矿工们使用风镐采煤的信心，也使领导干部大吃一惊：因为领导上计划在三月十五日达到三十七吨，争取到月底赶上山东六十吨的纪录。十三日淮南新庄子风镐采煤二一五吨的消息传到峰峰后，更鼓舞了大家，各个风镐组纷纷召开小组会，研究改进办法，争取赶上淮南的纪录。十四日中班杨五昌挖了六十吨，十五日赵文信挖七十四吨，接着张光贵挖了一百零四吨，赶上了斯达哈诺夫第一次创的新纪录。这个新纪录轰动了全矿，红榜标语到处张贴，大字捷报散到全矿的每个角落。次日中班申永元又创一百一十四吨的新纪录。十七日，传来二矿五一○掌子风镐手马金玉创一三八吨的新纪录的消息。本来就不平静的一矿，现在更激荡起来了。那幅用红笔写着“一三八吨！”的海报，不偏不颇地贴在一矿坑口的墙上，好像在向每个人挑战一样。风镐手惊愕地问道：“怎样一回事呀！咱一矿是老大哥，咱五○六掌子是全矿的重点实验区，二矿赶上来了！”原来，二矿的工人听到一矿创风镐挖煤的新纪录的捷报时，已经蹩不住气了。在得到领导上的支持和帮助以后，他们也组织三个小队，在五一○掌子里不声不响地搞起来了。
    一矿在工会的领导下，各小组都开了会，研究如何赶上二矿。“赶上二矿一三八吨纪录”的口号刚刚贴出去，杨二成就创了一五一吨。接着，十九日早班张金山又创了一百六十吨的新纪录。这时候，工人的情绪更高涨了，赶上淮南纪录的信心更足了。于是领导上又提出“赶上淮南新纪录，并向斯达哈诺夫第二次新纪录（二百二十七吨）看齐！”的口号。
    五○六掌子的风镐手有三个队，自从突破一百吨的纪录以后，二队就没有创过新纪录。赵文信就在这队里，感到十分蹩气。特别是二矿创一三八吨的纪录后，那些年青的调皮的工友当面刺激赵文信说：“二队落伍了！”赵文信心里热呼呼的，不管工作怎样累，总睡不着觉，翻来覆去的，想这想那。突然间，他想起采煤处处长说的那个办法：先从底下掏槽，然后照煤的劈层（纹理）斜着向下采，又省力又快。他又去问张光贵和杨二成，人家都说这个办法最好。十九日那天，他就找队里的工人开会，将这个技术上的道理说清楚，接着，他说：“咱们今晚创二百吨纪录怎样？”工人说：“不高！”并坚决表示：只要你能前进，我们保证跟上去！在那天夜里，二队展开了狂热的竞赛。赵文信的风镐进到那里，木工就把顶棚架到那里；撩煤工哗哗地把煤撩到电溜子里；机电工一直没离开风镐手，一听到响声不对头，马上检查修理。终于，在七小时零二十分钟内，胜利地创了二百四十三吨的新纪录！
    接着，二矿的罗永金同样在工人密切的配合和领导干部的鼓舞下，创造了二百五十四吨的最高纪录。
  条条道路通向抗美援朝
    “条条道路通向抗美援朝！”这是峰峰矿务局在风镐采煤创造新纪录后提出来的一个战斗号召。
    在整个抗美援朝的爱国主义生产竞赛中，风镐采煤创造新纪录运动像火车头一样，把许许多多的工作都带动起来了。每一个人都有决心在抗美援朝巨流中彻底涤洗自己工作中的黑点。机关里的职员开展了四反（反官僚、反文牍、反麻痹、反拖拉）三不错（不错数字、不错时间、不错办事）运动。该矿区机关工会主席告诉我一个故事：有一个部门送一份预算表来审查，经过许多道手续，每个经手人都在公文上批“同意”，直到预算表失踪后还没办完。统计室和打字室过去常常闹着“小数点搬家”的事，但现在已把错字减少到千分之零点六。过去的计划处没有计划，“上面忙死，下面闲死！”这是他们自己对过去工作情况的总结。现在，每个人都订出了自己的计划，并做到了“当天事，当天完”。基层干部开展了三勤（手勤、脚勤、嘴勤）运动。技术人员都深入现场，和工人研究技术。已往停留在核对账面数字的会计员，为了做好“分区当日成本计算”工作，都亲自下坑了解生产过程，并帮助做抗美援朝宣传工作。机电工人开展了一个反对浪费的六不漏（不漏煤、汽、水、风、油、电）运动。在这以前，电厂的锅炉房整日是“吱喳吱喳”地冒汽；机器房、泵房和透平房里一片片都是油光。自从工人们展开了六不漏运动后，已消灭了漏油现象，机器也擦得亮晶晶的。锅炉从未冒过一次汽，转运工也保证做到烟筒不冒黑烟，炉灰里没有煤碴，每月节省燃煤八万多公斤！
    矿工们在提高产量的同时，还开展了一个爱国主义的减低坑木吨耗运动。减低坑木吨耗是降低成本的主要环节。工人们自己提出：“多拿出一根木头就多给国家节省六十斤米！”三月二十三日夜晚，工人孙相银、刘玉桂等，为了欢迎中国共产党邯郸地委书记和专员，在四小时内创造了木垛回收率百分之百，棚子回收率百分之九十九的新纪录（过去最高为百分之八十）。二十九日，又创造了每吨煤消耗坑木零点零零九三立方米的最新纪录，只相当于过去的百分之十五，把每吨煤的掌子面成本从三万五千七百元减至八千元。工人的爱国热忱是难以想像的。我亲眼看见一个工人辛辛苦苦地把埋在顶塌里的木柱取出来。当他把木柱拔出来时，他兴奋无比地说：“又给国家省六十斤米！”
  创造！再创造！
    峰峰煤矿火热的风镐采煤创造新纪录运动正稳步地向深入的阶段发展。我到五○六掌子面参观的时候，工人们正在按苏联专家的建议，准备下层风镐采煤创造新纪录的工作。下层风镐采煤比上层困难。而且下层风镐采煤，在国内还是一个新的事儿，没有成功的经验可以学习，也没有失败的教训可以借镜。但是，掌握了新技术的中国工人一定能克服这些困难而前进的。我曾经这样问过风镐手张光贵、赵文信和罗永金：“你们有把握在下层风镐采煤中创造新纪录吗？”他们都肯定的满怀信心地答道：“看着吧！我们已经开始走上了周期作业，只要我们摸到一些规律后，就要开始的。”当矿工们听到淮南九龙岗煤矿创造集体效率七点八五吨（按：峰峰煤矿最高为四点二吨）的最高纪录时，他们立即开会讨论，并且订出一个计划：把掌子面集体效率提高到十吨纪录，风镐采煤要突破三百吨纪录！
    让我们预祝英雄们新的胜利吧！
