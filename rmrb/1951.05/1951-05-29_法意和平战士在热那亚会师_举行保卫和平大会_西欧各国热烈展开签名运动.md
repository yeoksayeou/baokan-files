Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: According to TASS, peace warriors from Marseilles, France's largest port, and Genoa, Italy's largest port, both situated on the Mediterranean coast, recently overcame numerous obstacles set by the reactionary authorities of both countries and successfully converged in Genoa, holding a very enthusiastic two-day Peace Defense Conference.

At this conference, there were workers, teachers, staff, and heroes of the resistance movement from Marseilles and the Provence region near Marseilles, as well as representatives of workers and urban and rural laborers from Genoa and the Liguria region near Genoa. They unanimously expressed their hatred of aggressive war and their love of peace and freedom. An Italian Catholic worker said, "We Catholic workers want to defend peace together with Communists, Socialists, and all those who desire peace." A Frenchman named Thomas, who had experienced various horrors in the Nazi Buchenwald concentration camp, declared, "Regardless of the government's aggressive plans, our people are striving for friendly cooperation with people all over the world."

The peace warriors of France and Italy also convened a mass meeting in Genoa's "Corvetto" Square, in front of the monument to the Italian patriot Mazzini. The entire square and the nearby boulevards were filled with Genoa citizens. Darvi, Chairman of the Provence Peace Committee, said at the meeting: We must win over those who have not yet stood with us, but who also sincerely do not want war. Donini, Director of the Italian National Peace Council, pointed out: This meeting is a new form of the struggle waged by the people of all countries to save peace and their countries. The people of Genoa and Marseilles will never allow the rulers of Italy and France to dedicate these two ports to their foreign masters to prepare for another war. He concluded by saying: This meeting opens up the great struggle of the people of France and Italy to win peace in the Mediterranean.

Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: According to TASS: The movement to collect signatures for the Declaration for a Peace Pact is being enthusiastically carried out in the Western European countries of the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and Austria.

The Netherlands began the signature campaign on April 7th, and as of May 26th, 101,125 people had signed the declaration. Finland began the signature campaign on April 22nd, with a target of one million signatures. As of May 28th, 240,000 people had signed. Denmark began collecting signatures on April 9th, and by May 11th, 80,351 people had signed. Danish youth have challenged Norwegian and Swedish youth to a friendly signature-collecting competition. In Austria, since the beginning of the signature campaign on March 5th, 600,000 people had signed the Declaration for a Peace Pact within two months, by May 5th. Sweden began the signature campaign on April 8th. In Gothenburg, young peace warriors collected more than 7,000 signatures, and in Stockholm, more than 3,200 people have signed. The Swedish National Committee for the Defense of Peace has designated the week from May 27th to June 2nd as "Peace Week" to intensify the signature campaign. Many famous writers, artists, scientists, educators, and clergy in Norway were among the first to sign the Declaration for a Peace Pact. The Norwegian capital, Oslo, has also established a Youth Committee for the Defense of Peace, composed of 65 youth groups and enterprises, to promote the signature campaign. The Swiss peace signature campaign began after the National Peace Defense Conference held in Zurich on April 29th and is now in full swing. The Free Swiss Youth Association recently published a declaration in the "Worker's Voice," calling on young people to participate in the signing.

    在这个会议上，有从马赛和马赛附近普罗芳斯区来的工人、教师、职员和抵抗运动的英雄，有从热那亚和热那亚附近利古里亚区来的工人和城乡劳动人民代表，他们一致表示对侵略战争的憎恨和对和平自由的热爱。一个信天主教的意大利女工说：“我们信天主教的工人要和共产党人、社会党人以及一切希望和平的人一道保卫和平。”曾经在纳粹的布肯瓦尔德集中营里经历了种种恐怖的法国人托马宣布：“我国人民不顾政府的侵略计划，努力和全世界人民友好合作。”
    法意两国的和平战士们又在热那亚“科维托”广场上，在意大利爱国志士马志尼的纪念碑前，召开了一个群众大会。整个广场和附近的林荫大道挤满了热那亚市民。普罗芳斯和平委员会主席达卫在会上说：我们必须争取那些还没有和我们站在一起、但是也是真诚地不希望战争的人们。意大利全国和平理事会理事多尼尼指出：这个会议是各国人民为拯救和平和他们国家而进行的斗争的新形式。热那亚和马赛的人民，决不允许意、法两国的统治者把这两个港口献给他们的外国主子来准备另一次战争。他最后说：这次会议揭开了法国和意大利两国人民争取地中海和平的伟大斗争。
