　　Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The US policy of rearming West Germany has caused poverty and disaster for the West German people. American monopoly capitalists and their servants, the West German big capitalists, are expanding the profits they obtain from military production by cutting workers' wages. According to the Bonn Trade Union Institute, workers' income now accounts for only 29 percent of the total national income, which is less than during the Hitler regime, when it accounted for 31 percent.

　　The actual purchasing power of this meager wage earned by workers is constantly declining due to the effects of rampant inflation. In 1950, it took 29 minutes of work for a worker to buy one kilogram of bread, but in 1951, it took 38 minutes. In 1950, it took 106 minutes of work to buy one kilogram of pork, but in 1951, it took 198 minutes.

　　Currently, the income of 50 percent of the people in West Germany is insufficient to maintain the minimum living needs. Out of West Germany's population of 45.48 million, 12 million people depend on relief for survival, including the unemployed, 4 million veterans who have lost their ability to work, and the dependents of those who died in World War II.

　　美国重新武装西德政策造成灾难
    西德人民生活困苦
    半数的人民收入不足维持最低生活
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国重新武装西德的政策，给西德人民造成了贫困和灾难。美国垄断资本家及其奴仆西德大资本家，用削减工人的工资，来扩大自军事生产中所取得的利润。据波恩工会研究所称，现在工人所得仅占整个国民收入的百分之二十九，比希特勒统治时期还少，那时占百分之三十一。
    工人这点少得可怜的工资，其实际购买力，还要因为恶性通货膨胀的影响而不断下降。在一九五○年，工人购买一公斤面包需要工作二十九分钟，到一九五一年，就需要工作三十八分钟；一九五○年购买一公斤猪肉，需要工作一百零六分钟，到一九五一年就需要工作一百九十八分钟。
    现在，西德有百分之五十的人民的收入不足维持最低限度的生活需要。在西德四千五百四十八万人口中，有一千二百万人依赖救济过活，其中包括失业者、四百万丧失工作能力的退伍军人、以及二次大战中牺牲者的遗属。
