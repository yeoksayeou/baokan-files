　　Reader Letters to This Newspaper Express Opinions
    The Postal Delivery of the People's Daily to Yunnan Should Be Improved
    A letter from the Yunnan Branch of Xinhua News Agency stationed in Kunming states: "...Because of slow postal delivery, it takes two months for the People's Daily to arrive. Please provide improvement suggestions to the post office to benefit readers."
    A letter from the Luoci County People's Government in Yunnan states: "It takes us more than twenty days to receive the People's Daily." (Editor's Note: From the above two letters, it can be seen that the speed of the People's Daily postal delivery in the Yunnan postal area is extremely inconsistent. (The plain letter sent by the Luoci County People's Government on March 6th was received by this agency on March 23rd, taking seventeen days. However, it takes more than twenty days for the newspaper to be delivered; while Kunming, which is close to Luoci by two days' postal route (Luoci is still northwest of Kunming), takes two months to see the newspaper.)
    A letter from the Anning Post Office in Yunnan states: "The People's Daily arrives so slowly, taking at least one and a half to two months. Readers feel that the news has become old news, so there are few subscribers." (This letter was a plain letter sent on March 5th and received by this agency on March 21st, taking sixteen days. - Editor)
    A letter from the Ludian Post Office in Yunnan states: "It takes about two months for the People's Daily to reach Ludian." (The plain letter from the bureau on March 7th was received by this agency on March 21st, actually taking only fourteen days. - Editor)
    A letter from the Yunlong County People's Government in Yunnan Province states: "The Chongwen Village People's Government in the first district of our county subscribed to a copy of the People's Daily at our county post office, but it took almost three months to receive it, so they have now discontinued their subscription."
    A letter from the Funing Post Office in Yunnan states: "On December 20th of last year, our bureau ordered a copy of the People's Daily from the Yunnan Postal and Telecommunications Administration, but we have not seen it yet" (This letter was sent on February 19th and received by this agency on April 24th - Editor)
    Editor's Note: From the above facts, it can be seen that the delivery time of newspapers and letters differs greatly, and the postal routes for letters and newspapers are obviously not the same; Luoci, which is farther than Kunming, receives newspapers faster than Kunming, which obviously indicates that there is a backlog of newspapers. It is already a very serious problem that readers in remote areas cannot read the capital's newspapers in a timely manner due to inconvenient transportation, and it is extremely inappropriate to add artificial obstacles to this. In this regard, we hope that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will quickly inspect and improve the situation.

### 本报读者来信提出意见  发往云南去的人民日报邮递工作应该加以改进

　　本报读者来信提出意见
    发往云南去的人民日报
    邮递工作应该加以改进
    驻昆明的云南新华通讯社来信说：“……因为邮递迟缓，人民日报需要两个月才能到达，请与邮局提供改进意见，以便利读者。”
    云南罗次县人民政府来信说：“我们要二十多天才能收到人民日报。”（编者按：从以上两信看，云南邮区对人民日报邮递的速度极不一致。（罗次县人民政府三月六日发来的平信，本社是三月二十三日收到的，计时十七日，报纸的邮递却要二十多天；而近于罗次两天邮路的昆明（罗次还在昆明西北边）反而要两个月才能看到报纸。）
    云南安宁邮局来信说：“人民日报因来得迟缓，最快需要一个半月到两个月，读者都觉得新闻变成了旧闻，故订户稀少。”（这封信是三月五日发出的平信，本社三月二十一日收到，计时十六天。——编者）
    云南鲁甸邮局来信说：“人民日报到鲁甸约需两个月时间”。（该局三月七日来的平信，本社三月二十一日收到，实际只走了十四天。——编者）
    云南省云龙县人民政府来信说：“我县第一区崇文村人民政府在我县邮局订了一份人民日报，几乎要三个月才能收到，因此现在已不续订了。”
    云南富宁邮局来信说：“去年十二月二十日我局向云南邮电管理局订人民日报一份，直到现在还未看到”（这信是二月十九日寄发的，本社四月二十四日收到——编者）
    编者按：从以上事实看出，报纸和信件的寄递时间相差甚远，信件与报纸的邮路显然不是一致的；远于昆明的罗次，收到报纸反比昆明快，其中显然有积压报纸的现象。边远地区读者因交通不便，不能及时阅读首都的报纸，已是一个很严重的问题，如再加上人为的障碍，是极不应该的。对此，我们希望邮电部迅速检查和改善。
