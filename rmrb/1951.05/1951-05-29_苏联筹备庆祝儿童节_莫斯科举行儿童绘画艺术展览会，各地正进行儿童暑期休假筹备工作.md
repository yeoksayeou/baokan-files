　　The Soviet Union is preparing to celebrate International Children's Day on June 1st. According to TASS, the 15th Soviet Children's Art Exhibition has opened in Moscow. The exhibition includes 340 items such as oil paintings, watercolors, pencil drawings, sculptures, and embroideries. Many of the oil paintings and drawings are based on the great construction projects of the Soviet Union. Children in various regions are preparing for the festival. For example, a kindergarten in the town of Arkhangelsk in northern Soviet Union has collected many pictures and other items to prepare for an exhibition on Children's Day, including letters written by Chinese children.

　　The Soviet Union is further developing children's welfare. Hundreds of beautiful sanatoriums, many children's parks, playgrounds, and travel rest stops have been built for children throughout the country. In the five years after the war, a total of 11 million children in the Soviet Union participated in Young Pioneer camps organized by various trade unions, with a total expenditure of over 5,136 million rubles. Two million children spent their summer vacations in summer sanatorium camps, improving their health. The number of year-round Young Pioneer camps has greatly increased, from 269 in 1945 to 2,681 now. In five years, Soviet trade unions have spent a total of 382.5 million rubles to run these Young Pioneer camps; 34 million rubles were spent in the past year alone. This year, more than five million primary and secondary school students in the Soviet Union will spend their vacations in Young Pioneer camps, sanatoriums, and travel rest stops throughout the country. Two million six hundred and fifty thousand children of workers and staff will rest in Young Pioneer camps alone, an increase of 300,000 over last year. Various regions in the Soviet Union are now actively preparing for children's summer vacations. Soviet trade unions will open 7,300 Young Pioneer camps before June 10th, 1,500 more than last year. In Moscow, Leningrad, Riga, the Urals, and along the Black Sea coast, the buildings of Young Pioneer camps are being repaired on a large scale. Outstanding teachers and doctors are being hired to guide the work of the summer camps.

    【新华社二十八日讯】苏联各地筹备庆祝六月一日国际儿童节。据塔斯社讯：苏联第十五届儿童绘画艺术展览会已在莫斯科开幕。展览品计有油画、水彩画、铅笔画、雕塑和刺绣等三百四十件，其中有许多油画和绘画是以苏联伟大的建设工程为题材的。各地的儿童都在筹备过节，例如苏联北部的亚尔干日可镇的一所幼稚园，已搜集了许多图片和其他物品，准备在儿童节开展览会，展览品中还有中国儿童写去的信。
    苏联正进一步兴办儿童福利事业。全国已为儿童建设了数百所美丽的疗养院，许多的儿童公园、游戏场及旅行休息站。战后五年中苏联共有一千一百万儿童参加了各工会举办的少年先锋营，这些少先营的经费总计达五十一亿三千六百万卢布以上。有二百万儿童在夏令疗养营中度过暑假，增进了健康。全年开放的少年先锋营现在已经大为增加，一九四五年有二百六十九个，现在有二千六百八十一个。五年中苏联工会共支出三亿八千二百五十万卢布来办这种少年先锋营，单是去年一年就用了三千四百万卢布。今年苏联将有五百多万中小学生在各地的少年先锋营、疗养院和旅行休息站中度假。单是在少年先锋营中休息的职工子弟就要有二百六十五万，比去年增加三十万名。现在苏联各地正为儿童的暑期休假积极进行筹备工作。苏联各工会在六月十日以前将开办七千三百个少年先锋营，比去年多一千五百个。在莫斯科、列宁格勒、里加、乌拉尔以及黑海沿岸，正在大规模修缮少年先锋营的房屋。各地正在聘请优秀的教师和医师来指导夏令营的工作。
