Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: According to TASS Moscow, May 21st: The Pravda correspondent in New York, Filipov, wrote an article commenting on the United States' illegal proposal to impose an embargo on the People's Republic of China, which the United States manipulated the United Nations to pass. He wrote: This proposal, concocted in the back rooms of the U.S. State Department and violating the basic requirements of the UN Charter and principles, was initially passed by the illegally established "Special Collective Measures Committee" under the command of the U.S. ruling group. In addition to the United States, Britain, and France, participants in this committee included some of the U.S. imperialist accomplices in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, as well as several U.S. satellite states such as Venezuela, the Philippines, and Turkey.

Even in this committee, discussions of the U.S. proposal revealed that this new measure by U.S. imperialism, aimed at expanding U.S. aggression in the Far East, did not receive the support of many UN member states.

In view of this, the U.S. ruling group resorted to their usual means of tyrannical oppression, blackmail, and intimidation to force countries to vote in the United Nations in favor of the aggressive proposal against the People's Republic of China.

The statement made by U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall at the joint meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Military Committee illustrates the extent to which the U.S. ruling group is pursuing its arbitrary coercive policy. One senator asked what measures the U.S. government had taken to induce Britain, France, and other countries – countries in the U.S. aggression bloc – to agree to participate in the economic blockade against China. Marshall openly replied that the State Department was using every possible means to put pressure on these countries. While the United States was exerting pressure on the governments of its allies behind the scenes, it also adopted open intimidation tactics. The U.S. Senate hastily passed a special resolution stating that the United States would cease providing Marshall Plan economic and financial "aid" to any country that refused to impose an embargo on China.

Britain and France, together with other major powers, bear primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, but their representatives have once again shamefully yielded to Washington's pressure.

Filipov continued: The proposal to impose an embargo on China, passed by the United Nations under U.S. direction, like all resolutions passed by the United Nations in the past under Washington's orders, has greatly undermined the UN Charter.

Filipov emphasized: The Soviet delegation, in both the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, exposed the true purpose of the embargo proposal and explained that the task of this proposal was not to end the Korean War or resolve the Korean issue peacefully, but to continue and expand U.S. aggression in the Far East.

This shameful U.S. proposal, passed by the U.S.-British majority group in the United Nations under the orders of the U.S. ruling group, has no legal effect and will never be recognized by the people of all countries.

### 联大非法通过对中国禁运案  永远得不到各国人民的承认  真理报记者痛斥美国无耻手段

　　联大非法通过对中国禁运案
    永远得不到各国人民的承认
    真理报记者痛斥美国无耻手段
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：真理报驻纽约记者费利波夫撰文评论美国操纵联合国所通过的对中华人民共和国实施禁运的美国非法提案。他写道：这个在美国国务院密室中策划出来的、违反联合国宪章与原则的基本要求的提案，最初是由在美国统治集团命令下非法成立的“特别集体措施委员会”通过的。参加这个委员会的除了美、英、法三国以外，还有侵略性北大西洋集团中美帝国主义的一些同谋犯们，以及像委内瑞拉、菲律宾、土耳其一类的若干美国卫星国。
    即使在这个委员会中，讨论美国提案的情形也泄露出，美帝国主义者这个以扩大美国在远东的侵略为目的的新措施，并没有得到联合国许多会员国的支持。
    有鉴于此，美国统治集团又使用了他们所惯用的横暴的压迫、讹诈、恫吓手段，强制各国在联合国投票通过反对中华人民共和国的侵略性提案。
    美国国防部长马歇尔在参议院外交委员会和军事委员会联席会议上所发表的声明，说明了美国统治集团奉行他们专横威逼的政策已经到了什么程度。有一个参议员问美国政府曾采取了什么措施来促使英、法及其他国家——美国侵略集团的国家——同意参加对中国的经济封锁。马歇尔公开地答道，国务院正在用一切可能的方法对这些国家施加压力。美国一方面在幕后对它各盟国的政府行使压力，同时又采取公开恫吓的方式。美国参议院匆忙地通过了特别决议，其中说，凡是拒绝对中国实行禁运的国家，美国将停止给予马歇尔计划的经济与财政“援助”。
    英国和法国与其他大国一道共同负有维持国际和平与安全的主要责任，但是它们的代表又一次地向华盛顿的压力作了可耻的让步。
    费利波夫继续写道：联合国在美国意旨下所通过的对中国实行禁运的提案，正像联合国过去在华盛顿的命令下所通过的一切决议一样，都大大地破坏了联合国宪章。
    费利波夫强调指出：苏联代表团在联合国大会政治委员会和联合国大会全体会议中，都揭露了禁运提案的真正目的，并且说明了这个提案的任务不是要结束朝鲜战争或用和平方式解决朝鲜问题，而是要继续进行并且扩大美国在远东的侵略。
    联合国美英多数集团在美国统治集团的命令下所通过的这个可耻的美国提案，没有法律上的效力并且永远得不到各国人民的承认。
