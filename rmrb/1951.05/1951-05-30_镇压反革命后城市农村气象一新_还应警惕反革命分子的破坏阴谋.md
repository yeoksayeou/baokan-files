　　After Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries, Cities and Villages Have a New Look
    We Should Still Be Vigilant Against the Sabotage Conspiracies of Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    After Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries in Shigailiang Village, Cadres and the Masses Work with Enthusiasm.
Editor:
    After suppressing counter-revolutionaries, a new atmosphere has emerged in Shigailiang Village, District Three, Zhangbei County, Chahar Province.
    Before liberation, Shigailiang Village was the domain of the local despots and landlords Chang Youli and Wang Pu. They served as puppet bao and jia chiefs in the village, riding roughshod over the people and committing all kinds of evil. After the People's Liberation Army liberated Zhangbei County in 1949, the bandits Chang and Wang colluded with other bandits to cause disturbances on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan, killing more than 30 of our district and village cadres and civilians. In April 1950, the masses assisted the government in capturing the bandit Wang, but the government released him after detaining him for more than four months. After returning to the village, the bandit Wang remained unrepentant, threatening cadres and intimidating the masses. As a result, village cadres dared not work, and eleven out of twenty village cadres quit. The masses were also worried and fearful; the emancipated peasants Hu Siju and An Guoyong and two other families returned more than 90 mu of land they had been allocated to the village office; Yu Wanfu, Wang Shicai and others sold the large cattle they had been allocated and spent the money on food and drink.
    Since the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Zhangbei County People's Court accepted the just demands of the masses and arrested and executed the two counter-revolutionary elements Chang and Wang. The people in the Shigailiang Village area felt that the big rock pressing on their heads had been removed, and the cadres and the masses were filled with vigor. All twenty cadres boldly and actively started working. In the past, there were twenty or so militiamen in the village, but they could not be assembled when something happened; now the militiamen are voluntarily going out to catch bandits, and their number has increased to more than forty. The peasants now dare to cultivate the land they have been allocated. Village cadres are leading the masses in a lively production campaign. During the spring plowing and sowing season, all 84 oxen in the village were put to work together, and in more than 20 days, more than 11,000 mu of farmland were all sown. Some old people in the village also said: "After the counter-revolutionaries were suppressed, we feel at ease, and we have more energy when working."

    After Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries in the Taiyuan Railway Factory, Production Enthusiasm is High and Tasks are Overfulfilled.
Editor:
    Since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary principal offender Yang Wu, the production enthusiasm of the workers in the Taiyuan Railway Factory has been continuously rising, and all workshops have shown a new atmosphere. The production tasks for March and April have been overfulfilled. The cast iron section of the foundry workshop exceeded the task by six tons and forty-two jin; the cast steel section exceeded the task by two tons and six hundred and two jin; the locomotive section overfulfilled the task by two locomotives; the rolling stock section overfulfilled the task by two passenger cars and eleven freight cars, creating an unprecedented glorious record for the Taiyuan Railway Factory.
    After liberation, the counter-revolutionary element Yang Wu infiltrated the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau as the depot chief and used his position to provoke disunity among the workers and secretly develop a spy organization. At that time, due to the ideological paralysis of the workers, Yang Wu's counter-revolutionary activities were not discovered for a long time. Yang was later transferred to the Taiyuan Railway Factory as the chief of the dispatching section and continued to carry out sabotage. After the outbreak of the Korean War, when the American invading army landed at Incheon, he spread rumors, saying that the United States had chemical weapons that were more powerful than atomic bombs. After the news of the victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces in Seoul reached the Taiyuan Railway Factory, many workers jubilantly celebrated, but Yang tore up the newspaper to wipe his nose and continued to spread rumors, promoting "the power of American atomic bombs" and hitting the workers' production enthusiasm, making it impossible for the workers to concentrate on production.
    Since the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Wu was suppressed, the production enthusiasm of the workers has generally increased, and the production outlook has been completely renewed. The most significant example is the dispatching section where Yang worked. In the past, accidents often occurred, but since Yang was arrested, the section has not had a single accident. In the past, the rolling stock section needed 290 work hours to repair a passenger car, but now it only takes 255 work hours to repair the same car.
    The sabotage facts of the counter-revolutionary element Yang Wu have universally increased the political vigilance of the factory's workers. Many workers said: "We were too paralyzed before. Spies were causing trouble in front of us, which made it impossible for us to complete our tasks. In the future, we must assist the government in resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, tracing the root of counter-revolutionary rumors, preventing sabotage by spies, and ensuring the safety of the factory, so that we can protect our fruits of victory."

    Counter-Revolutionary Agents in Taixing County, Northern Jiangsu, Bomb Elementary School Students.
Editor:
    On May 12, an incident occurred in Huangqiao East Street Elementary School in Taixing County, Northern Jiangsu, in which counter-revolutionary elements threw bombs and injured eleven elementary school students. This incident shows that die-hard counter-revolutionaries are still carrying out sabotage in various ways. We must raise our vigilance and assist the government in severely suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
    At 9:00 a.m. on May 12, the children of Huangqiao East Street Elementary School were playing games in the courtyard. At this time, a Japanese Type 88 bomb was thrown into the schoolyard, injuring eleven children. The school teachers immediately reported the incident to the local people's government, which launched an investigation and sent the injured children to the hospital for treatment.
    At the same time that the counter-revolutionary elements bombed the students of East Street Elementary School, a bomb planted by agents was also found next to the toilet of West Street Elementary School in Huangqiao District. Fortunately, it was discovered by the students early.
    More than 20,000 people in the district were extremely disgusted with the counter-revolutionary elements' crimes against children and sent representatives to comfort the injured children. On the afternoons of the 12th and 13th, hundreds of teachers and students from East Street and West Street Elementary Schools in Huangqiao District, as well as workers, peasants, and industrial and commercial circles in Huangqiao District, held demonstrations to publicize the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries to the masses; calling on everyone to expose and capture counter-revolutionary elements and avenge the injured children.

  Seventy-Five Bridge Workers Poisoned in Meng County, Pingyuan
  Editor:
    Recently, an incident occurred in Guguan Village, District Three, Meng County, Pingyuan Province, in which seventy-five bridge workers were all poisoned. This is another crime of the Kuomintang's remnant bandit gangs killing the people and sabotaging construction; it has powerfully taught us that we must not be paralyzed in the slightest degree against counter-revolutionary elements.
    Guguan Village, District Three, Meng County, is close to the Mang River in the north, and the large stone bridge over the river was destroyed during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In early April this year, the Construction Section of the County People's Government led workers to begin construction; however, the agents attempted to sabotage this construction project, and on April 11, they poisoned the bridge workers' lunch. After eating the poisoned food, the workers felt very uncomfortable in their stomachs, but no one paid attention. By evening, six workers could not bear the discomfort, and they had both stomachaches and diarrhea. After another hour, more than seventy workers were shouting with stomachaches. Ten of the most severely poisoned workers were rolling on the ground in pain and could not even speak. At this time, Comrade Xi Wende from the Construction Section suspected that the workers had been poisoned and immediately notified the doctor to provide emergency treatment. After examination by Dr. Liu Zhenyang from the County Health Institute, it was confirmed that they were indeed poisoned. After emergency treatment, the workers with milder poisoning gradually recovered after ten minutes; the workers with more severe poisoning did not fully recover until the 13th. Because the treatment was timely, there was fortunately no danger to life.
    The main reason for this worker poisoning incident was that the personnel leading the project were ideologically paralyzed and had never conducted education on resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries among the workers, so the workers lost the vigilance they should have had against counter-revolutionary elements, which caused the workers to be poisoned.
    After the incident, Liu Xiande, Chairman of the Meng County Trade Union, personally went to the construction site to express his condolences and educate the workers on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The local Public Security Bureau is investigating the criminals who poisoned the workers in order to arrest them and bring them to justice.

  Jinxi Chemical Factory Should Strengthen Security Work
Editor:
    Although the employees of all departments of our Jinxi Chemical Factory have made raising political vigilance and assisting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries an important item in the "Patriotic Covenant" of our department, the security work of our factory still lacks the necessary systems, and the vigilance of the guards is not high enough, which makes it easy for bad elements to exploit loopholes. For example, in order to study the factory's further development plan, the administrative side sent a technician from the production section to take photos around the factory. Although he had a photography certificate, the patrolling guards did not even ask about it when they saw him. Also, the gate guards are not very strict. When people carry large bags and backpacks in and out of the factory, the guards do not ask about them at all; on Sundays, employees can also enter the factory at will; even one night, Comrade Zheng Yi, a technician from the production section, returned to the factory for something, and the guard at the gate only asked, "Where are you from?" and let him in. He neither looked closely at the badge nor checked his ID card. From these facts, it can be seen that the security work in our factory is very lax, and if bad elements exploit loopholes, it will cause losses to state property. Therefore, I suggest that the factory strengthen security work, strictly establish and implement various guard systems; strengthen the education of guards, and improve their political vigilance to prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements.

    A Certain Iron and Steel Plant Did Not Mobilize Employees to Participate in the Large-Scale Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries.
Editor:
    A certain iron and steel plant in a certain place ignored the work of propaganda and education and mobilizing the masses in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Obviously, this is contrary to the policy of large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
    Since the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," the factory has only organized technical personnel and staff to conduct one study session, but the study was very perfunctory; the workers have only heard one report on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. On April 26, the municipal public security organs arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements in the factory. However, the factory neither announced their bloody crimes to the masses nor carried out propaganda to the masses. This has caused anxiety among some employees, and their hatred for counter-revolutionary elements is also not strong. On May 10, the city held a rally to accuse and publicly try counter-revolutionary elements. Although the factory organized employees to listen to the broadcast of the rally, which aroused the resentment of the broad masses of employees against counter-revolutionary elements, the factory leaders did not seize the opportunity to carry out in-depth propaganda and education and mobilize employees to make accusations. Therefore, the masses have not been mobilized to this day. The employees only know that the People's Government is suppressing counter-revolutionary elements, but they do not know how to participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement themselves.
    The locomotive factory of the company also has the same tendency. When the city held a rally to accuse and publicly try counter-revolutionary elements, many employees asked the administration, the general party branch, and the trade union to listen to the broadcast of the rally, but they were rejected by the leaders. Employees were generally dissatisfied, saying: "Whether or not to suppress it has nothing to do with us, the People's Government can do it."

　　镇压反革命后城市农村气象一新
    还应警惕反革命分子的破坏阴谋
    石盖梁村镇压反革命后干部和群众工作有了劲编辑同志：
    察哈尔省张北县三区石盖梁村，经过镇压反革命，出现了一片新气象。
    石盖梁村在解放前是恶霸地主常有理、王普的天下。他们在村里当伪保、甲长，骑在人民头上，无恶不作。一九四九年人民解放军解放张北县后，常、王两匪纠合土匪在察绥边缘骚乱，被他们杀害的我区村干部和群众有三十多人。一九五○年四月间，群众协助政府将王匪捕获，但政府把他关押了四个多月就把他释放了。王匪回村后，依然怙恶不悛，威胁干部，吓唬群众。因而村干部不敢工作，二十个村干部就有十一个躺倒不干。群众也都提心吊胆；翻身农民胡四举，安国永等三家把分得的九十多亩地退回了村公所；于万福、王世财等把分得的大牛卖去吃喝了。
    自大张旗鼓镇压反革命后，张北县人民法院接受群众的正义要求，将常、王两个反革命分子逮捕处决。石盖梁村一带的人民感到压在自己头上的大石头给除掉了，干部和群众们充满了朝气。二十名干部都大胆积极地干起工作。过去村里有二十几个民兵，遇事集合不起来；现在民兵们自动出外捉土匪，人数已增到四十多个。农民分得的地现在也敢种了。村干部领导群众热火朝天地闹生产。春耕播种期间，全村八十四犋牛一起出动，二十多天功夫，一万一千多亩大田全部种完。村里有些老人也说：“镇压了反革命，心安了，干起活来也有劲了。”

    太原铁路工厂镇压了反革命生产情绪高涨超额完成任务编辑同志：
    太原铁路工厂自从镇压了反革命要犯杨武以后，职工生产情绪不断高涨，各车间呈现了一片新气象，三、四月份均超额完成了生产任务。翻砂厂铸铁班超过任务六吨又四十二斤；铸钢班超过任务二吨又六○二斤；机车所超额完成机车二台；车辆所超额完成客车两辆，货车十一辆，创造了太原铁路工厂的空前光辉的纪录。
    反革命分子杨武在解放后即混入太原铁路局石家庄机务段当段长，并利用职权挑拨职工团结，暗中发展特务组织。此时，因职工思想麻痹，杨武的反革命活动长期未被发现。杨匪后被调至太原铁路工厂任调度股长，仍继续进行破坏。朝鲜战争爆发，美国侵略军在仁川登陆后，他大肆造谣，说美国有化学武器，比原子弹还厉害。中朝人民部队在汉城胜利的消息传到太原铁路工厂后，许多职工都欢腾鼓舞地庆祝，但杨匪却把报纸撕了擦鼻涕，并继续造谣，宣传“美国原子弹厉害”，打击职工生产情绪，使职工不能安心生产。
    自从将反革命罪犯杨武镇压了以后，职工生产情绪普遍高涨，生产面貌焕然一新。最显著的如杨犯所在的调度股，以前常出事故，自从将杨犯逮捕后，该股还没有出过一次事故。车辆所过去修一辆客车要二百九十个工，现在修同样的一辆车，只用二百五十五个工。
    反革命分子杨武的破坏事实，使该厂职工政治警惕性普遍提高。很多职工说：“以前我们太麻痹了，特务在我们面前捣乱使我们老是完不成任务，今后一定要协助政府坚决镇压反革命，向反革命谣言追根，防止特务破坏，保证工厂安全，才能保障咱们的胜利果实。”

    苏北泰兴县特务炸伤小学生编辑同志：
    苏北泰兴县黄桥东街小学五月十二日发生反革命分子投炸弹炸伤小学生十一名的事件。这事件说明：死心蹋地的反革命还在多方进行破坏。我们必须提高警惕，协助政府严厉镇压反革命。
    五月十二日上午九时，黄桥东街小学的小朋友们都在院子里做游戏。这时，校外投进来一枚日本八八式的炸弹，十一个儿童受了伤。该校教师当即报告当地区人民政府，进行侦缉，并将受伤儿童送医院治疗。
    与反革命分子炸伤东街小学学生同时，黄桥区西街小学厕所旁边，亦发现特务暗放的炸弹一枚。幸被学生及早发现。
    全区二万多人民对反革命分子残害儿童的罪行极为痛恨，纷纷派代表慰问受伤的小朋友。十二、十三日两天下午，黄桥东街、西街两小学数百师生和黄桥区工人、农民及工商业界分别举行示威游行，向群众宣传反革命的罪恶；号召大家检举、捉拿反革命分子，为受伤的儿童复仇。

  平原孟县七十五名桥工中毒
  编辑同志：
    平原省孟县三区谷旦村最近发生了七十五名修桥工人全部中毒事件。这是国民党残余匪帮杀害人民破坏建设的又一罪行；它有力地教训了我们：对于反革命分子，是一点也麻痹不得的。
    孟县三区谷旦村北面紧靠蟒河，河上的大石桥在抗日战争时期被破坏了。今年四月上旬，县人民政府建设科领导工人开始修建；但是特务分子却企图破坏这一建设事业，竟于四月十一日在建桥工人的午饭内下了毒药。工人们吃了有毒的饭后，肚子很难受，但是谁也没有注意。到傍晚时，首先有六个工人难受的忍不住了，又肚疼又下泄。又经过一个钟头，七十多个工人都叫喊肚疼。十个中毒最严重的工人，痛得就地打滚，连话也不会说了。这时建设科席文德同志才怀疑工人是中毒，立即通知医生设法急救。在县卫生院刘祯扬医生检查结果，证实确系中毒。经过急救，中毒较轻的工人在十分钟后已渐渐好转；中毒较重的工人，到十三日才全部痊愈。因为医治及时，幸未发生生命危险。
    这次发生工人中毒事件，主要是由于领导工程的人员思想麻痹，从未在工人中进行过抗美援朝和镇压反革命的教育，所以工人对反革命分子失去应有的警惕，这就造成了工人遭受毒害的事件。
    事件发生后，孟县工会主席刘先德亲往工地慰问，并向工人们进行了镇压反革命的教育。当地公安局正调查此次毒害工人的凶犯，以便缉拿归案法办。

  锦西化学工厂应加强保卫工作编辑同志：
    我们锦西化学工厂各部门职工虽然已经把提高政治警惕，协助政府镇压反革命作为本部门“爱国公约”中的一个重要项目，但是本厂的保卫工作还缺乏必要的制度，警卫人员的警惕性也还不够高，这就容易给坏分子钻空子。例如：工厂行政方面为研究本厂进一步发展的计划，便由生产科技术员在厂的四周摄影。他虽然带有摄影证件，但是巡逻的警卫同志看见了也不过问。再说门警吧，也很不严格。有人背了大皮包、背包等进出工厂，警卫的同志根本不过问；星期日，职工也随便可以进入工厂；甚至有一天夜间，生产科技术员郑毅同志因事返厂，警卫门岗的同志只问了声：“那里的！”就放进来了。既不细看符号，也不查身份证。从这些事实可以看出：我们工厂的保卫工作是很不严紧的，如果给坏分子钻了空子，就会使国家财产受到损失。所以我建议厂方要加强保卫工作，严格订立并实行各项警卫制度；加强对警卫人员的教育，提高他们的政治警惕性，以防止反革命分子的破坏。

    大张旗鼓镇压反革命中某炼铁厂没有发动职工参加编辑同志：
    某地钢铁公司炼铁厂在镇压反革命运动中，忽视了宣传教育和发动群众的工作。显然这是和大张旗鼓镇压反革命的方针相违背。
    自从中央人民政府公布了《惩治反革命条例》以后，该厂仅组织技术人员和职员进行了一次学习，但是学得很马虎；工人们也只听过一次关于镇压反革命问题的报告。四月二十六日，该市公安机关在该厂逮捕了一批反革命分子。但该厂既未向群众宣布他们的血腥罪恶，也未向群众进行宣传。以致引起部分职工不安，同时对反革命分子的憎恨也不强烈。五月十日，市里召开了控诉、公审反革命分子大会。该厂虽曾组织职工收听大会的广播，激起了广大职工对反革命分子的愤恨；但是该厂领导上却没有抓紧时机深入地进行宣传教育，发动职工进行控诉。因此，群众至今没有发动起来。职工们只知道人民政府在镇压反革命分子，至于自己如何参加镇压反革命运动是不摸底的。
    该公司机车厂也同样存在这种偏向。当该市召开控诉、公审反革命分子大会时，有很多职工到行政、党总支、工会要求收听大会的广播，却被领导拒绝了。职工普遍引起不满，他们说：“镇压不镇压和咱们无关，人民政府干就行了。”
