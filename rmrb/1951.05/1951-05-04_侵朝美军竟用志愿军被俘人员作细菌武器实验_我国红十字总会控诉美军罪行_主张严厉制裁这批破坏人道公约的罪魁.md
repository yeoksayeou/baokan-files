Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The Red Cross Society of China General Headquarters, regarding the recent use of captured Chinese People's Volunteers by U.S. imperialism for bacteriological weapon experiments, has lodged an accusation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross Societies, and requests sanctions. The accusation states: The U.S. invading army in Korea recently had an infantry landing craft, under the guise of epidemic prevention, loaded with bacteria, sailed to Wonsan Port in Korea, and used captured Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons.

This inhuman behavior of the U.S. invading army is intolerable to anyone with a sense of justice. Standing on humanitarian grounds, this association cannot sit idly by and watch the development and existence of such beastly crimes. We hereby lodge an accusation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross Societies, demanding sanctions against the culprits who violated humanitarian conventions, and urge the sixty-eight Red Cross member countries and peace-loving people all over the world to rise up and fight to eliminate these unforgivable enemies of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, April 30th: Just as people all over the world are demanding a public trial of Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, and are closely watching the U.S. war criminals' large-scale criminal conspiracy to manufacture bacteriological weapons at Nan Sang Tian County in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, and at Detrick Camp near Washington, D.C., the U.S. military is actually using captured volunteer soldiers for bacteriological weapon experiments.

According to U.S. magazine reports: A U.S. military ship under the name of "epidemic prevention," but actually bearing a "secret mission" of bacteriological warfare, has sailed to Wonsan Port on the east coast of Korea, which the U.S. Navy has been unable to conquer for a long time, and is inhumanly using captured Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. On April 9th, the U.S. magazine *Newsweek* published a message entitled "Black Death Ship," stating: "Note the secret mission of a Navy experimental epidemic prevention ship. This ship has been sent to Wonsan Port on the east coast of North Korea. There, the Navy has maintained a long-term siege." It also stated: "This ship is an infantry landing craft, equipped with a laboratory, complete with rats and rabbits." And said: "The Marines grabbed some Chinese Communists from the small islands off the port and brought them on board to test whether they already have symptoms of the terrible Black Death."

    我国红十字总会控诉美军罪行
    主张严厉制裁这批破坏人道公约的罪魁
    【新华社三日讯】中国红十字会总会为最近美帝国主义将我国被俘志愿军作细菌武器试验，特向国际红十字委员会及国际红十字协会提出控诉，并要求予以制裁。控诉书说：美国侵朝军队最近有一艘以防疫为名的步兵登陆艇，满载细菌，开到了朝鲜元山港，把中国人民志愿军被俘人员，当作细菌武器的试验品。
    美国侵略军这种灭绝人性的行为是稍有正义感的人们所不能容忍的。本会站在人道主义立场上，不能坐视此种野兽罪行的发展与存在，特向国际红十字委员会及国际红十字协会控诉，要求制裁破坏人道公约的罪魁，并促请六十八个红十字会员国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民，一致奋起，为消灭这批不可饶恕的人民公敌而斗争。
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】正当全世界人民要求公审日本细菌战犯，并密切注视美国战犯们在日本京都府南桑田郡及美国华盛顿附近迪特瑞克营大规模从事制造细菌武器的罪恶阴谋之际，美军竟用我志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验。
    据美国杂志透露：美军的一艘以“防疫”为名，实际负有“秘密使命”的细菌船只，已开到美国海军久攻不下的朝鲜东海岸元山港，并正灭绝人性地以中国人民志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验。四月九日美国《新闻周刊》以《黑死病船》为题，发表消息称：“请注意海军的一艘实验防疫的船只的秘密使命。这船已被派至北朝鲜东海岸的元山港。在那里，海军已维持了一个长期的围攻。”又称：“这船是一艘步兵登陆船，上设实验室，老鼠兔子俱全。”并称：“海军陆战队从该港的小岛上抓了一些中国共产党，带到船上，试验他们是否已有可怖的黑死病的症候。”
