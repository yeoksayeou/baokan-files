　　Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The war-monger Rusk, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, delivered a speech on U.S. policy toward China at the annual meeting of the so-called "China Institute in America" in New York on the 18th. This organization is composed of American imperialist elements and traitors to the Chinese people. In this speech, Rusk openly declared the U.S. government's determination to do everything possible to implement its criminal policy against the Chinese people.

　　In his speech, Rusk announced that the U.S. "national policy" is to exert all its strength to support the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang in Taiwan, to support counter-revolutionary elements on the Chinese mainland, and to undermine the People's Republic of China from the outside and inside. He said: "We recognize the National Government of the Republic of China, even if the territory it governs is very limited. This government will continue to receive significant American aid and assistance." He brazenly clamored for so-called "Chinese people who have lost their country" to "rise up to defend their freedom and create their own destiny according to their own historical goals," and promised them "enormous assistance."

　　In order to create arguments for the U.S. aggressive policy, this U.S. Assistant Secretary of State fabricated all kinds of vile and shameless rumors. He nonsensically said: "The territorial integrity of China is now a mockery. ... The Soviet Union marched into Xinjiang, ... Inner Mongolia seceded from China's political organization, the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria... China is losing its vast northern region." He raved like a madman: "On Chinese maps published on the Chinese mainland, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and the western and southwestern regions are somewhat different from China," "The trade union badges that appear on the streets of Beijing, the Chinese map on them no longer has Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia."

　　Rusk's speech completely exposed the Truman administration's lies that it only wanted to "limit" aggression against China. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in explaining the U.S. government's policy exposed by Rusk on the 23rd, reiterated that the U.S. policy has always been against the Chinese people, and "Rusk was merely repeating the well-known issues in American policy."

### 战争贩子鲁斯克叫嚣侵略我国  制造无耻谣言诬蔑我国人民

　　战争贩子鲁斯克叫嚣侵略我国
    制造无耻谣言诬蔑我国人民
    【新华社三十日讯】美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿鲁斯克，于十八日在纽约美国帝国主义分子与中国人民叛徒组成的所谓“华美协进社”年会上，发表了一篇美国对中国政策的演说。在这篇演说中，鲁斯克公开宣告美国政府决心尽一切可能来施行反对中国人民的罪恶政策。
    鲁斯克在演说中宣布美国的“国策”是要尽一切力量，支持在台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮，支持中国大陆上的反革命分子，从外部和内部来破坏中华人民共和国。他说：“我们承认中华民国的国民政府，即使它所管辖的领土已很有限。这个政府将继续得到美国的重大援助与帮助。”他公然叫嚣要所谓“失掉了国家的中国人”“起来维护他们的自由，并按照自己的历史目标创造自己的命运”，并许诺给他们“巨大的援助”。
    为了替美国的侵略政策制造论据，这位美国助理国务卿竟胡造各种下流无耻的谣言。他胡说道：“中国领土完整现在成了一句讥讽的话。……苏联进兵新疆，……内蒙脱离了中国的政治机构，苏联侵入满洲……中国正在丧失其广大的北部地区。”他像疯子一样地胡说道：“中国大陆上所出版的中国地图上新疆、内蒙、满洲和西部及西南地区与中国有一些不同”，“北京街头上出现的工会证章，那上面的中国地图已没有了新疆与内蒙”。
    鲁斯克的这一演说完全拆穿了杜鲁门政府所谓只想“有限度”侵略中国的谎言。而美国国务卿艾奇逊二十三日在解释鲁斯克所暴露的美国政府这一政策时，再次宣布美国政策一贯就是反对中国人民，“鲁斯克不过是重说了美国政策中尽人皆知的问题而已”。
