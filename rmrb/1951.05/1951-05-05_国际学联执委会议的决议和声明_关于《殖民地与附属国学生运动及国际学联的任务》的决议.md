　　Resolutions and Statements of the Executive Committee Meeting of the International Student Union
    Resolution on "The Student Movement in Colonies and Dependent Countries and the Tasks of the International Student Union"
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Executive Committee Meeting of the International Student Union, held in Beijing, passed the following resolution on "The Student Movement in Colonies and Dependent Countries and the Tasks of the International Student Union" on April 30:
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union, having heard and discussed the report by the President of the International Student Union, Mr. Grohman, on "The Student Movement in Colonies and Dependent Countries and the Tasks of the International Student Union," and having studied the factual evidence presented by the representatives of student organizations from various colonies and dependent countries, hereby reiterates that complete national independence is a prerequisite for a truly democratic and progressive education system.
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union, representing millions of students worldwide, reaffirms the following fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of the International Student Union: "To assist students in colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries in achieving their full social, economic, and educational development, and for this purpose, to provide all possible assistance to the students and peoples of these countries in their struggle for freedom and independence."
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union notes the severe situation of education in colonies and dependent countries and the shockingly poor conditions in which students in these countries find themselves.
    Due to the colonial system, hundreds of millions of young people are even deprived of the opportunity to receive primary education. Some countries, with millions of inhabitants, do not even have a single institution of higher education. In some colonies and dependent countries with only a few universities, students lack the most basic conditions for normal study; dormitories, canteens, medical facilities, libraries, laboratories, and equipment for scientific research are extremely scarce. High tuition fees and rising living costs make it possible for only a small number of young people to receive higher education.
    While the Executive Committee of the International Student Union recognizes that only complete and genuine national independence can fundamentally solve the education problems in colonies and dependent countries, it also emphasizes that the struggle to meet the current needs and interests of students in colonies and dependent countries is one of the most important tasks of national student organizations and the International Student Union.
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union supports the just demands of students in colonies and dependent countries for free primary education, expansion of secondary and higher education, and equal opportunities for all young men and women, regardless of race, nationality, origin, or social status, to receive higher education.
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union particularly believes that the various demands made by students in colonies and dependent countries on colonial authorities and governments, such as establishing sufficient state-funded places for poor students, building student dormitories and canteens, reducing tuition fees, providing free medical treatment, and allowing students free use of laboratories and libraries, are entirely legitimate. The Executive Committee calls on student organizations worldwide to support this movement by students in colonies and dependent countries. The Secretariat of the International Student Union should support the development of these countries' broader movements demanding improved living conditions. Holding national conferences to discuss student needs can help develop concrete plans in various countries to improve student living conditions.
    The International Student Union calls on national student organizations to increase their support for the International Student Relief Fund in order to assist students in colonies and dependent countries, and recommends that the Secretariat increase the number of International Student Union scholarships and beds in the International Student Union sanatorium in Czechoslovakia available to students in colonies and dependent countries.
    The Executive Committee expresses its satisfaction with the proposal of the All-China Students' Federation to establish an International Student Union Asian Student Sanatorium in China in the near future.
    The International Student Union notes with extreme concern the suppression of national languages and cultures in various colonies and dependent countries, while colonial doctrines and racist theories are promoted. The Executive Committee of the International Student Union has always recognized the principle of equality of all peoples and respect for the rights of all nations, large and small, and therefore strongly protests against racial discrimination and the suppression of national cultures in colonies and dependent countries, and fully supports the movement of students in colonies and dependent countries demanding teaching in their own national languages, teaching of their national history, and the training of teachers and professors from among their own people. The International Student Union calls on national student organizations to actively support plans for the democratic reform of curricula, advocating the elimination of colonialism and racism, anti-scientific theories, and the falsification of national history in education in colonies and dependent countries.
    The colonialists' policy of repression against students, suppressing student organizations working for the interests of students in colonies and dependent countries, imprisoning staff members of student organizations, banning their activities and their newspapers, preventing them from participating in international gatherings, and expelling progressive students and professors from universities, are all matters of deep concern to us. The Executive Committee of the International Student Union calls on students to strongly protest such actions and to fully support the movement for democratic student self-government in specialized schools and universities.
    The Executive Committee believes that in order for the struggles of student organizations in various colonies and dependent countries to be victorious, it is first necessary to make greater efforts to win the common action of the broadest possible range of students, both those belonging to the International Student Union and those not belonging to the International Student Union, holding rallies, demonstrations, and national and regional conferences to defend student rights, and submitting petitions to their respective governments and the governments of their suzerain states. Student organizations must cooperate and support each other more with teachers, professors, youth organizations, trade unions, women's organizations, and other democratic organizations, acting together to improve living conditions and fight for their vital rights.
    The International Student Union calls on students worldwide, especially students in suzerain states, to provide more forceful and concrete support for the noble struggle for national independence. The Executive Committee of the International Student Union opposes taking an elder-brother attitude in cooperation with students in colonies and dependent countries, considering this to be a manifestation of colonialism, and at the same time particularly emphasizes the importance of working together to eliminate colonialism among students in both colonies and suzerain states, and instructs the Secretariat to fully support students in colonies and dependent countries in their efforts to publicize and explain their struggles to students in their suzerain states and to establish friendly ties through concrete support actions. The Executive Committee further instructs the Secretariat to ensure the wide dissemination of news about the situation and struggles of students in colonies and dependent countries. To this end, the International Student Union should support and initiate visits by student representatives from these countries to universities in suzerain states. The Executive Committee instructs the Secretariat to investigate the possibility of sending delegations to various regions around the world to strengthen ties with student organizations in colonies and dependent countries and to establish new ties and cooperation.
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union notes with deep concern that fierce colonial wars are being waged in many countries, and these wars are equally harmful to students in colonies and dependent countries and students in suzerain states. The Executive Committee calls on students in suzerain states to oppose colonial wars and foreign interference.
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union notes with great satisfaction the contribution of students in colonies and dependent countries to the cause of defending peace, and calls on students worldwide to work together to fight for peace and to develop and strengthen the friendship and solidarity between students in colonies and dependent countries and students in suzerain states.
    The "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism" – February 21 – initiated by the International Student Union and the World Federation of Democratic Youth in 1948, has become the most significant commemorative day for students worldwide, widely commemorated around the world, becoming a day to mobilize millions of young people and students to support the struggle of young people and students in colonies and dependent countries. The International Student Union will continue to do everything possible to provide all possible assistance to students in colonies and dependent countries who are fighting for their just demands.
    The Executive Committee of the International Student Union is convinced that the millions of students in all countries of the world will more forcefully support students who are fighting for peace, national independence, and democratic education, and that they will make a great contribution to the work of solving the basic needs of students in colonies and dependent countries.

　　国际学联执委会议的决议和声明
    关于《殖民地与附属国学生运动及国际学联的任务》的决议
    【新华社讯】在北京举行的国际学生联合会执行委员会会议于四月三十日通过的关于《殖民地与附属国学生运动及国际学联的任务》的决议如下：
    国际学生联合会执行委员会听取并讨论了国际学联主席格罗曼关于《殖民地与附属国的学生运动及国际学联的任务》的报告，并研究了各殖民地附属国学生团体代表所提出的事实证据，特再次表明：彻底的民族独立是真正民主和进步的教育制度的先决条件。
    国际学生联合会执行委员会代表全世界千百万学生，重申国际学生联合会会章规定的下述基本原则：“协助殖民地、半殖民地和附属国的学生取得他们在社会、经济和教育方面的充分发展，并为此目的，对这些国家的学生和人民所进行的争取自由和独立的斗争，给予一切可能的援助。”
    国际学联执委会注意到殖民地附属国教育的严重情况，并注意到这些国家学生所处的惊人恶劣的环境。
    由于殖民制度，成千百万年青人甚至被剥夺了受初等教育的机会。有一些国家，有着好几百万人口，然而连一所高等教育机构也没有。在一些设有寥寥数所大学的殖民地及附属国里，学生们没有进行正常学习的最基本条件，宿舍、食堂、医疗设备、图书馆、实验室和进行科学研究的设备都异常缺乏。学费的高昂和生活费用的上涨，使得只有少数年青人有能力受到高等教育。
    国际学联执委会虽然知道，只有完全和真正的民族独立才能根本地解决殖民地附属国的教育问题，但却同时强调，为满足殖民地附属国学生的当前需要和利益而斗争，是各国学生团体和国际学联最重要的任务之一。
    国际学联执委会支持殖民地附属国学生主张实行免费初等教育，扩充中等和高等教育，使一切男女青年，不分种族、国籍、出身或社会地位的差别，都有受高等教育的均等机会等正义要求。
    国际学联执委会特别认为，殖民地和附属国学生对殖民当局和政府的种种要求，诸如为贫苦的学生设立足够的国家公费名额、举办学生公寓和食堂、减低学费、供给免费医药治疗、允许学生自由使用实验室和图书馆等等，都是完全正当的。执委会号召全世界的学生团体支持殖民地附属国学生的这个运动。国际学联书记处应支持这些国家更为广泛地要求改善生活状况的运动的发展。举行全国性会议讨论学生的需要，可以帮助在各国制定改善学生生活状况的具体计划。
    国际学联号召各国学生团体为了资助殖民地附属国的学生而增加它们对国际学生救济基金的支持，并建议书记处增加给予殖民地附属国学生的国际学联奖学金名额及在捷克斯洛伐克的国际学联疗养院的床位。
    中华全国学生联合会建议近期内在中国建立国际学联亚洲学生疗养院，执委会对此表示满意。
    国际学联极度关怀地注意到各殖民地和附属国的民族言语及文化横遭压制、而殖民学说和种族主义学说却得到扶植的情况。国际学联执委会从来就承认各族人民平等及尊重一切大小民族的权利的原则，因此它猛烈地抗议种族歧视和压制殖民地附属国的民族文化的行为，并完全支持殖民地附属国学生要求以他们自己的民族语言教学、教授本国历史、从他们本民族的人当中培养教员和教授的运动。国际学联号召各国学生团体积极支持课程民主改革的计划，鼓吹在殖民地附属国肃清教育中的殖民主义和种族主义倾向、反科学的理论和伪造民族的历史。
    殖民者对学生采取镇压的政策，镇压为殖民地附属国学生的利益而努力的学生团体，囚禁学生团体的工作人员，禁止它们的活动和它们的报纸，阻止它们参加国际的集会，开除大学里的进步学生和教授。这都是使我们深切关怀的事情。国际学联执委会号召学生们强硬地抗议这样的行动并全力支持在专科学校和大学争取学生民主自治会的运动。
    执委会认为，为了各殖民地附属国学生团体的斗争取得胜利，首先必须更加努力，争取最广大的，不论是属于国际学联的学生和不属于国际学联的学生共同行动，举行保卫学生权利的集会、示威和全国的及地区的会议，向他们各自的政府及其宗主国的政府提出请愿书等。学生团体须与教员、教授、青年团体、工会、妇女团体和其他民主团体更多地合作和互相支持，为争取改善生活条件和切身的权利而共同行动。
    国际学联要求全世界的学生特别是宗主国的学生，更为有力和具体地支持争取民族独立的崇高斗争。国际学联执委会反对在与殖民地附属国学生的合作中持长者的态度，认为这是殖民主义的一种表现，同时并特别强调共同努力以在殖民地和宗主国学生中消灭殖民主义的重要性，并指示书记处全力支持殖民地附属国学生努力向其宗主国学生宣传并解释他们的斗争及通过具体的支援行动建立友谊联系。执委会更进一步指示书记处保证广泛地传布关于殖民地附属国学生情况和斗争的消息。为了这一目的，国际学联应支持并发动这些国家的学生代表到宗主国的大学参观。执委会责成书记处调查有无可能派遣代表团到全世界各个地区去，以加强与殖民地附属国学生团体的联系，并建立新的联系和合作。
    国际学联执委会深为关切地注意到在许多国家里正进行着激烈的殖民战争，这些战争对殖民地与附属国的学生和宗主国的学生是同样有害的。执委会号召宗主国的学生反对殖民战争和外国干涉。
    国际学联执委会极为满意地注意到殖民地附属国学生对保卫和平事业的贡献，并号召全世界学生共同合作为和平而斗争，发展和加强殖民地附属国学生和宗主国学生的友谊和团结。
    国际学生联合会和世界民主青年联盟在一九四八年发起的“反殖民制度斗争日”——二月二十一日，已成为全世界学生的最具重大意义的纪念日，它在全世界被广泛纪念，成了动员千百万青年和学生支持殖民地附属国青年与学生斗争的日子。国际学联将继续尽一切力量，对于正在为他们的正当要求而斗争的殖民地附属国学生，给予一切可能的援助。
    国际学联执委会深信，全世界各国千千万万的学生将更有力地支持正在为争取和平、民族独立和民主教育的学生们，他们对于解决殖民地附属国学生的基本需要的工作将有更大的贡献。
