　　Tianjin Patriotic Catholic Denounces Wen Guibin's Crimes Against the Chinese People; Demands Government Expel This Imperialist Element from Chinese Territory
　　The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association hosted representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations in the city on the 23rd, denouncing the crimes of the imperialist element Wen Guibin (former Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese) in harming the Chinese people and oppressing Catholics. Catholics in Tianjin exposed Wen Guibin's crimes of undermining the Catholic Reform Movement as early as January of this year. On the evening of the 16th of this month, more than 300 Catholics lined up to Wen Guibin's residence for a face-to-face interrogation. Wen Guibin finally had to admit the facts of consistently engaging in counter-revolutionary activities and embezzling the property of two churches. The Catholics were extremely angry and immediately announced that they would no longer recognize Wen Guibin as bishop from that day forward. The next day, Wen Guibin secretly transported church materials. Catholics immediately formed a church property protection committee that afternoon to prevent this. On the 18th, more than 300 Catholics who participated in the questioning rally issued a "Letter to All Catholics in the City," calling on Catholics throughout the city to rise up and denounce Wen Guibin's crimes. In order to gain the support of people from all walks of life in the city, this reception was held.
　　At the meeting, Wu Kezhai, Chairman of the Reform Movement Promotion Association, delivered a speech. Nie Guoping, Secretary-General of the Reform Movement Promotion Association and Vice Principal of the French-Chinese Middle School, revealed Wen Guibin's shameless crimes of opposing the Chinese people for decades, and called on the people of Tianjin and the whole country to support their struggle against imperialist elements. Sui Shouyi, a member of the association, representing young Catholics in Tianjin, demanded that Wen Guibin be expelled from China. In their written statements, the democratic parties, and in their speeches, the representatives of the people's organizations, unanimously expressed their firm support for the demands of patriotic Catholics. Representatives from Catholic church schools such as Tianjin Jingu University and Xikai Middle School also expressed their support for the patriotic actions of Catholics and denounced the crimes of imperialist elements in their respective schools on the spot.
　　According to reports, Wen Guibin came to China from France in 1901 and became the bishop of Tianjin in 1922. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Wen Guibin vigorously promoted the Japanese invaders. Japanese special agents priests Taguchi and Iwashita lived in Xikai Church, planning to carry out espionage activities through Catholicism. Wen Guibin even ordered churches in various counties of the Tianjin Diocese to provide intelligence to the Japanese invaders and cooperate with the Japanese invaders in attacking anti-Japanese base areas. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Wen Guibin immediately turned to American imperialism. Many Chinese and foreign priests in Tianjin, under the instruction of Wen Guibin, became American spies or Kuomintang agents. In 1947, Shen Zitian, a French priest who escaped from the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church international spy case in Xian County, fled to Tianjin. Wen Guibin praised them as the "Vatican's suicide squad" and "Jesus's brave soldiers." In the summer of the same year, Wen Guibin, together with international spy Lei Zhenyuan and Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Catholic Jin Yupei, jointly planned to establish the special agent organization "People's National Construction Advancement Association." Lei Zhenyuan's other Catholic special agent organization, the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps," also received various assistance from Wen Guibin. On the eve of the liberation of Tianjin, in November 1948, Wen Guibin also designated Dutch priest Bern and Zheng Huamin to be responsible for forming another reactionary organization, the "Our Lady's Service Group." After the liberation of Tianjin, Wen Guibin arranged a complete set of plans to undermine our country's sovereignty and oppose the People's Government and the Communist Party. According to the reactionary orders of Pope Pius XII, Wen Guibin announced to the Catholics that the Communist Party was the "devil"; those who welcomed the People's Liberation Army, participated in parades, worked in the organs of the People's Government, or studied at North China University would go to "hell." He even forbade Catholics from singing the national anthem and reading the people's newspapers, and forbade hanging portraits of leaders and national flags in church schools. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, he openly promoted the "power" of American imperialism and constantly spread rumors that the Third World War was about to break out. After patriotic Catholics in Tianjin initiated the Reform Movement, Wen Guibin tried his best to undermine it. On the one hand, he deceived Catholics by saying that there was "no imperialism" within Catholicism and that the Reform Movement was against God; at the same time, he threatened patriotic Catholics and priests with "going to hell," "stopping divine merit," and "removing divine power." He also distributed a large number of "terrible communism" and reactionary documents such as the "Study Reference" issued by the imperialist element Li Peili among the Catholics; he also personally wrote an article entitled "The Catholic Church's View on the Three-Self Patriotic Movement," slandering the Reform Movement. He also sent his lackeys to infiltrate the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association in an attempt to sabotage it. Wen Guibin's anti-people facts have aroused the infinite anger of Tianjin Catholics, and they unanimously demand that this imperialist element be expelled from the country.

　　天津天主教爱国分子
    控诉文贵宾危害中国人民的罪行
    要求政府把这个帝国主义分子驱逐出中国国土
    天津市天主教革新运动促进会于二十三日招待该市各民主党派、各人民团体代表，控诉帝国主义分子文贵宾（前天津教区主教）危害中国人民、欺压教友的罪行。天津市天主教徒早于今年一月就揭发了文贵宾破坏天主教革新运动的罪行。本月十六日晚，三百余天主教徒又列队至文贵宾处，当面质询。文贵宾终不得不承认一贯进行反革命活动及私吞两间教堂财产的事实。教徒们极为愤怒，当即宣布自即日起不再承认文贵宾为主教。次日，文贵宾又偷运教会物资。教徒们当日下午即组成保护教产委员会，加以防范。十八日，参加追询集会的三百余教徒发表“告全市教友书”，号召全市教徒起来控诉文贵宾的罪行。为了取得全市各界人民的支持，乃召开此次招待会。
    会上，革新运动促进会主任委员吴克斋致词后，革新运动促进会秘书长、法汉中学副校长聂国屏在讲话中揭发了文贵宾数十年来反对中国人民的无耻罪行，并要求全天津，全国人民支持他们对帝国主义分子的斗争。该会委员隋守义代表天津青年天主教徒，要求把文贵宾赶出中国。各民主党派在书面谈话中，各人民团体代表在讲话中，一致表示坚决支持爱国天主教徒的要求。天主教教会学校津沽大学、西开中学等校代表也表示支持天主教徒的爱国行动，并当场控诉了帝国主义分子在各该校的罪行。
    按，文贵宾于一九○一年由法国来我国，一九二二年到天津充当主教。抗日战争期间，文贵宾为日寇大肆宣传。日寇特务神甫田口、岩下即住在西开教堂内，策划通过天主教进行特务活动。文贵宾更命令天津教区各县教堂供给日寇情报，配合日寇进攻抗日根据地。日寇投降后，文贵宾即投靠美帝国主义。天津的许多中外籍神甫，在文贵宾的指使下变成了美国间谍或国民党特务。一九四七年，献县张家庄天主堂国际间谍案漏网分子法籍神甫申自天等逃至天津。文贵宾赞扬他们是“梵蒂冈的敢死队”，“耶稣的勇兵”。同年夏天，文贵宾与国际间谍雷震远、蒋匪特务天主教徒金玉培共同策划建立特务组织“民众建国协进会”。雷匪震远另一天主教的特务组织“公教青年报国团”，也得到文贵宾的多种帮助。天津市解放前夕，一九四八年十一月，文贵宾又指定荷兰籍神甫柏恩、郑化民负责组成另一反动组织“圣母御侍团”。天津市解放后，文贵宾布置了整套的破坏我国主权、反对人民政府及共产党的计划。文贵宾根据教皇庇护十二世的反动命令，在教徒中宣布：共产党是“魔鬼”；凡是欢迎解放军，参加游行，参加人民政府机关工作，入华北大学学习的都要入“地狱”。甚至禁止教徒唱国歌和看人民的报纸，教会学校内不准挂领袖像和国旗。美国发动侵朝战争后，他公开宣传美帝国主义的“强大”，不断造谣说第三次世界大战即将爆发。天津市天主教爱国教徒发起革新运动后，文贵宾更百般进行破坏。他一面欺骗教徒说：天主教内“没有帝国主义”、革新运动就是反对天主；同时更以“下地狱”、“停神功”、“摘神权”来威胁爱国教徒与神甫。他更在教徒中散布大量的“恐怖的共产主义”及由帝国主义分子黎培里发出的《学习参考》等反动文件；他还亲自写了一篇《天主教会对三自运动的观点》，诬蔑革新运动。他并派遣走狗打入天津天主教革新运动促进会，企图进行破坏。文贵宾反人民的事实，已激起天津天主教徒的无比愤怒，他们一致要求把这个帝国主义分子驱逐同出国国土。
