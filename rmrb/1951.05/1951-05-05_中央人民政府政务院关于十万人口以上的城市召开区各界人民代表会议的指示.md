Throughout the country, twelve cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Harbin, Shenyang, and Zhangjiakou, have convened district people's representative conferences in all or some of their districts. Important experiences have been gained, proving that convening district people's representative conferences is indeed necessary for large and medium-sized cities. This plays a significant role in the People's Government's connection with the broad masses of people, the implementation of municipal administration, the resolution of residents' welfare issues, and the supervision, criticism, and self-criticism of the People's Government's staff. For this reason, this experience should be promoted urgently. Following the suggestions of Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, at the first session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, it is stipulated that in the future, all cities with a population of over 100,000 throughout the country should convene people's representative conferences in their respective urban and suburban districts. The following specific instructions are hereby issued:

(1) All cities with a population of over 100,000 throughout the country must universally convene people's representative conferences in all districts within 1951 and establish a regular system.

Some cities, although their population is less than 100,000, but have special circumstances in politics or other aspects, may also convene district people's representative conferences with the approval of the Greater Administrative Region or Provincial People's Government.

(2) The already promulgated "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Large Cities" and "General Rules for the Organization of People's Governments in Large Cities" shall apply to all large and medium-sized cities with a population of over 100,000, with respect to their various principles.

(3) All important work in the district shall be submitted to the District People's Representative Conference for discussion. In addition to solving the residents' welfare issues based on necessary and possible conditions, the conference shall also listen to the work reports of the District People's Government and review the work.

(4) Establish a District Consultative Committee and strengthen its work.

(5) The Municipal People's Governments shall supervise and provide specific guidance to the convening of people's representative conferences in the urban and suburban districts under their jurisdiction, and help them summarize their experiences and report them in a timely manner.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于十万人口以上的城市召开区各界人民代表会议的指示
    全国已有北京、天津、南京、上海、济南、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、哈尔滨、沈阳、张家口等十二个城市所属全部或部分的区，召开了区人民代表会议，并已取得一些重要经验，证明了区人民代表会议的召开确为大、中城市所必需，这对于人民政府联系广大人民、推行市政，对于解决居民福利问题，对于人民政府工作人员的督责、批评与自我批评之开展，均有很大作用。为此， 亟应推广这一经验，遵照中央人民政府刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议上的提示，规定今后全国各地在十万人口以上的城市，均应召集各该城区和郊区的人民代表会议；兹并作如下的具体指示：
    （一）全国十万人口以上的城市，均须于一九五一年内普遍召开各区的人民代表会议，并形成经常制度。
    某些城市，虽其人口不及十万，而在政治上或其他方面有特殊情形者，经大行政区或省级人民政府之批准，亦得酌开区的人民代表会议。
    （二）已颁之大城市区各界人民代表会议组织通则及大城市区人民政府组织通则，其中各项原则规定，适用于一切十万人口以上的大、中城市。
    （三）区的一切重要工作，均应提交区各界人民代表会议讨论。除根据必要与可能条件解决居民福利问题外，并应听取区人民政府工作报告，对工作加以检讨。
    （四）建立区协商委员会，并加强其工作。
    （五）各市人民政府，应对所辖城区郊区的人民代表会议的召开加以督促与具体指导，并帮助其总结经验，及时上报。
              总理  周恩来
            一九五一年四月二十四日
