　　The "Meeting on Handling Organizations Receiving US Subsidies," convened by the Committee on Handling Organizations Receiving US Subsidies under the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, concluded on April 30th after five days.

　　The meeting adopted the "Implementation Measures Regarding the Handling of Relief Organizations and Relief Agencies Receiving US Subsidies." These measures will be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation. The meeting also adopted a joint declaration by all attending representatives.

　　During the meeting, some representatives who had personally experienced oppression and abuse in "relief" agencies run by American imperialism and other imperialisms, with hearts filled with anger, made profound accusations against the cruel crimes of these entities, which, under the guise of "relief" and "charity," carried out aggression and harmed the Chinese people and Chinese children. The accusers included orphans, blind people, nuns, professors, religious figures, and staff members from organizations receiving US subsidies.

　　The holding of this meeting enabled the participating representatives to have a clearer understanding of the aggressive nature of the "relief" agencies of American imperialism in terms of ideology. The attending representatives unanimously expressed their determination to sever all ties with American imperialism, eliminate its aggressive influence, and unite with people in the national relief and welfare circles under the banner of patriotism to do a good job in relief and welfare work.

　　The meeting used a consultative approach to specifically discuss and determine various relevant issues regarding the handling of national relief and welfare organizations receiving US subsidies. The China Blind Welfare Association and the China Leprosy Association have severed their original ties with the United States. The meeting decided that the China People's Relief Association would assist them in carrying out reorganization work and take steps to improve their operations. The remaining national relief and welfare organizations receiving US subsidies, some have already ended automatically, some have requested takeover, and some are no longer in charge. Therefore, the relief and welfare undertakings they run will be taken over by the local relief branches. Other local relief agencies receiving US subsidies shall be taken over by the local relief branches.

　　The meeting finally adopted a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao and a telegram of salute to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and held a signing ceremony in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and a vote against the US arming of Japan.

　　处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议闭幕
    全国救济福利社团将分别由救济总会和各地分会协助改组或予以接办
    中央人民政府政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会召集的“处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议”，历时五天，已于四月三十日闭幕。
    会议通过了《关于处理接受美国津贴的救济社团及救济机关实施办法》。该办法将呈请政务院批准后实施。会议又通过了全体出席代表的联合宣言。
    会议进行期间，一部分曾在美国帝国主义和其他帝国主义办理的“救济”机关中身受欺压和摧残的代表，含着愤怒的心情，对这类假借“救济”“慈善”进行侵略，并残害中国人民及中国儿童的残酷罪行作了沉痛的控诉。控诉者包括孤儿、盲人、修道女、教授、宗教界人士及接受美国津贴救济机关中的工作人员。
    这次会议的举行，使与会代表们在思想上对美国帝国主义“救济”机关的侵略实质，有了更加明确的认识，出席代表一致表示坚决要割断与美国帝国主义的一切联系，肃清其侵略影响；并表示要团结全国救济福利界人士，在爱国主义的旗帜下，搞好救济福利事业。
    会议用协商方式，具体商定了处理接受美国津贴的全国性救济福利社团的各项有关问题。中国盲民福利协会及中华麻疯协会已断绝与美国的原有联系，会议决定由中国人民救济总会帮助其进行改组工作，并采取步骤改进其业务；其余的接受美国津贴的全国性救济福利社团，有的已自动结束，有的请求接收，有的已无人负责，故其所办的救济福利事业均由当地救济分会予以接办；其他接受美国津贴的地方性的救济机关，一律由当地救济分会予以接办。
    会议最后通过了向毛主席的致敬电及向中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬电，并举行了拥护缔结和平公约的签名和反对美国武装日本的投票。
