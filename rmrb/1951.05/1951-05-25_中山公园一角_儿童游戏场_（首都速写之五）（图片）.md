　　A Corner of Zhongshan Park
    —Children's Playground— (Sketches of the Capital, No. 5)
    Shao Yu, 作 [made/created]
    We are playing games,
    Our hearts are filled with joy,
    We sing "The East is Red,"
    We are growing up in Mao Zedong's era!
    Mom has gone to see the exhibition of I-Kuan-Tao crime evidence,
    Mom said she'll be back in a little while,
    Mom wants to clearly recognize the enemy.
    Dad and Mom both said:
    Good days are just beginning,
    Enemies are not allowed to sabotage!
    Enemies will not be allowed to exist!

　　中山公园一角
    ——儿童游戏场—— （首都速写之五）
    邵宇  作
    我们做着游戏，
    心里充满愉快，
    我们唱着《东方红》，
    我们生长在毛泽东的年代！
    妈妈去看一贯道罪证展览会去啦，
    妈妈说一会就回来，
    妈妈要把敌人认清楚看明白。
    爸爸、妈妈都说过：
    好日子才开头，
    不许敌人破坏！
    不让敌人存在！
