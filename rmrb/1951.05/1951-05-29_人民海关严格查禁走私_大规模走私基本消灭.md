The People's Customs strictly prohibits smuggling, which has basically eliminated the large-scale smuggling that had long existed and was supported by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang before liberation. It has played a significant role in implementing foreign trade control policies, protecting national production and construction, and reversing the trade deficit of the past seventy-three years. In the past year, customs offices across the country have investigated and dealt with more than 37,000 smuggling cases. The Shantou Customs once seized smuggled goods worth more than 300 million RMB. The Haikou Customs once seized smuggled goods worth more than 400 million RMB. The Guangzhou Customs successively seized four smuggling steamships in two days. The border area near Hong Kong, which was the most serious area of smuggling during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, has been strictly sealed off by the public security department since February this year, strictly prohibiting anyone from crossing the border. Large inspection sheds have been set up at Shenzhen and Kowloon Customs, and inspection procedures and methods have been improved, making the so-called "rush the border" impossible. The long-standing problem of "water passengers" (small-scale merchants who frequently travel between Hong Kong and Macau) smuggling goods, has been gradually resolved because the border public security organs have adopted the "exit and entry permit" method to further manage the "water passengers." The number of "water passengers" smuggling foreign goods has decreased from more than 7,000 per day to more than 400.

In order to do this work well, customs offices in various places have universally launched mass anti-corruption campaigns internally. Through various methods such as education, introspection, and reporting, the customs staff have gradually eliminated the bad habits of corruption and bribery that were common before liberation. Many employees resolutely refuse bribes. Some customs offices have achieved a situation where no one is corrupt throughout the year. Individual elements who continued to be corrupt have been severely punished under mass supervision and exposure. This is an important reason for the development of anti-smuggling work. Customs offices in Tianjin, Yantai and other places rely on trade unions to mobilize dockworkers to automatically assist in the work when ships dock. If suspicious signs are found, they are immediately reported to the customs. This has also played an important role in anti-smuggling. Customs offices in various places have also obtained assistance from public security and other agencies, which has greatly improved the efficiency of anti-smuggling work. For example, in more than half of the smuggling cases cracked by the Tumen Customs last year were cracked or assisted by other agencies and the masses (especially public security agencies and militiamen). In handling smuggling cases, customs offices in various places have adopted the principle of "strictly handling affairs according to law, distinguishing between objects, differentiating between seriousness, and combining punishment with education," correcting the erroneous methods of not handling affairs according to law, and one-sidedly emphasizing punishment or one-sidedly emphasizing education.

### 人民海关严格查禁走私  大规模走私基本消灭

　　人民海关严格查禁走私
    大规模走私基本消灭
    人民海关严格查禁走私，使解放前长期存在的帝国主义和蒋匪帮所支持的大规模走私现象基本消灭。在贯彻对外贸易管制政策、保护国家生产建设、扭转七十三年来的入超局面上，起了重大的作用。去年一年中，全国海关共查获走私案件三万七千多件。汕头海关一次查获走私货物值人民币三亿余元。海口海关一次查获私货值人民币四亿余元。广州海关曾在两天内连续查获走私汽船四只。香港附近我国的边境上，在国民党反动统治时代是走私最严重的地区。自今年二月起，公安部门已予严密封锁，严禁任何人闯越边境。在深圳、九龙海关设立了大检查棚，改进了检查秩序和方法，使过去所谓“闯关”成为不可能。过去长期存在的港、澳“水客”（时常来往港澳的单帮商人）走私问题，由于边防公安机关采用了“出、入境证”的办法，对“水客”实行进一步的管理，现已渐趋解决。私运洋货的“水客”已由每日七千余人减至四百余人。
    为做好这一工作，各地海关曾在内部普遍开展群众性的反贪污运动。以教育、反省、检举等各种方式，逐步肃清海关员工解放前习以为常的贪污受贿等恶劣作风。许多职工坚决拒贿。有些关已做到全年无一人贪污。个别继续贪污的分子，经群众监督与揭发，受到严厉制裁。这是查私工作开展的重要原因。天津、烟台等海关依靠工会，发动码头工人，自动在船只靠岸时协助工作。发现可疑迹象，立即报告海关。在查私中也起了重要作用。各地海关并取得公安等机关协助，大大提高了查私工作效率。如图们关在去年破获的走私案件，一半以上是其他机关和群众（尤其是公安机关和民兵）破获或协助破获的。在处理走私案件中，各地海关采取了“严格依法办事，分清对象，区别轻重，处罚和教育相结合”的方针，纠正不依法办事，和片面强调处罚或片面强调教育的错误办法。
