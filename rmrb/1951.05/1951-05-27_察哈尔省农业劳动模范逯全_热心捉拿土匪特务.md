　　Chahar Province Agricultural Labor Model Lu Quan
    Enthusiastically Captures Bandits and Secret Agents

Editor Comrade:

　　Lu Quan, a representative to the Chahar Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, is not only an agricultural labor model but also a hero in capturing secret agents. His home is near the Tianzhen Railway Station, and he often leads the militia to patrol the area around the station. In the past month, he led the militia in capturing four bandits and secret agents.

　　On the morning of April 17th, two villagers outside the station told Lu Quan, "Bandit leaders Weng Xianglian and Weng Xiangli just got off the train and headed south." Lu Quan looked south and could still see two dark figures about half a kilometer away. He immediately sent Wang Wenyou, a militiaman from his village, to follow the bandits from behind. He himself returned and mobilized the village militia, and also wrote a letter to Comrade Liu Yin, a district cadre working in the Brick Kiln Village, asking them to mobilize the Brick Kiln militia to capture the bandits together. At 3:00 PM, Wang Wenyou returned and reported that the Weng Xianglian brothers had settled down in Shizu Cave Village (eight li from the station). As soon as it got dark, Lu Quan led eleven militiamen to gather at Brick Kiln Village, and Brick Kiln Village also sent ten militiamen to help them. Lu Quan and the twenty-one militiamen rushed to Shizu Cave Village and immediately surrounded the two courtyards of the Weng bandits' uncle and cousins. After searching inside, they didn't find them. They said that after eating lunch, they went to Sizhuang Village in Huaian. By this time, it was 2:00 AM. Sizhuang Village was still twenty li away from this village, and the militiamen had not eaten yet. Lu Quan said: We must strike while the iron is hot and be responsible to the people to the end. I will contribute 30,000 yuan in Renminbi as travel expenses for our village militia. The ten militiamen from Brick Kiln also said: We are willing to pay our own travel expenses to capture the bandits. So they cheered up and rushed to Sizhuang Village in Huaian under the starry night. They arrived just as the sun was rising. After explaining their intentions to the village cadres, the village cadres felt that this matter was very important and helped them capture the Weng bandit brothers from Guo Wuzi's house and sent the criminals to the County People's Government. In late April and early May, he also captured two counter-revolutionaries. The local people admire Lu Quan's enthusiasm for capturing bandits.

　　察哈尔省农业劳动模范逯全
    热心捉拿土匪特务编辑同志：
    察哈尔全省农业劳动模范代表会议的代表逯全，不仅是一个农业劳动模范，而且是一个捉特务的英雄。他的家住在天镇车站附近，他常领着民兵在车站附近巡查。最近一个月内，他领着民兵抓住了四个土匪、特务。
    四月十七号上午，车站外有两个老乡告诉逯全说：“土匪头子翁祥连、翁祥礼，刚下火车往南走了。”逯全往南一看，还能看见一里外有两个黑影。他马上派本村民兵王文有在土匪后边跟着，自己回来，一面动员本村民兵，一面给在砖窑村工作的区干部刘印同志写信，请他们动员砖窑民兵一同去捉土匪。下午三点，王文有回来报告，翁祥连兄弟两个已在石咀洞村（离车站八里）住下了。天刚黑，逯全就领着十一个民兵到砖窑村集合，砖窑村也派出十个民兵去帮助他们。逯全和二十一名民兵，赶到石咀洞村立刻包围了翁匪的大伯和叔伯兄弟的两个院子。进去一搜，却没有搜着，说是吃晌午饭就上怀安四庄村去了。这时，已是夜两点了，四庄村离这村还有二十里地，民兵们还都没有吃饭，逯全说：咱们要趁热打铁，要对人民负责到底，我拿出三万元人民币作我们村民兵的路费。砖窑十个民兵也说：愿自己拿路费去捉土匪。于是他们又振作精神星夜奔往怀安四庄村。太阳刚露头就赶到了。找村干部说明来意，村干部一听，也觉着这件事情很重要，就帮着他们从郭五子家把翁匪兄弟二人一齐抓住了，并把该犯送到县人民政府。四月底与五月初，他又捉住两个反革命分子。当地人民对逯全热心捉土匪，都很钦佩。
