Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions
Inspection Report by the Industry and Commerce Section of Wanping County, Hebei Province, Regarding the Masses Buying and Selling Railway Materials

To the Editors:

Regarding the criticism in the "Readers' Letters" column of your newspaper on April 16th, "Railway Materials Cannot Be Bought and Sold Casually" by Comrade Wu Xiang, we hereby submit our handling situation and inspection report as follows:

During the Anti-Japanese War, the masses of Wanping County bravely blew up enemy transportation and destroyed enemy碉堡 (dí bǎo, pillboxes), thus preserving items such as iron thorns, barbed wire, and railway materials. Most of these materials were later collected and used by military supply departments, and the remaining small amount was scattered in various villages or mountain gullies.

Last summer, Wanping suffered heavily from severe flooding. Due to financial difficulties, farmers repeatedly requested to sell scrap iron. We sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways to inquire about handling methods. Before the Ministry of Railways responded, the masses continued to demand a solution to this problem, and there was a phenomenon of secret selling. At this time, we believed that it was a pity for the scrap iron to rot in the ground, and that the masses could sell it to survive the famine, and that it was also needed for the construction of Beijing. Therefore, we agreed that farmers could sell the scrap iron in an organized manner. To this end, we contacted the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and we transported the scrap iron to Beijing, asking the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce to assist in inspection and introduce sales.

From December 1950 to March of this year, farmers in Wanping County, with our approval, transported and sold scrap iron to Beijing more than ten times, totaling about ten tons, most of which was scrap. Later, we received a letter from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce stating: "Your county originally planned to transport and sell scrap iron to our city, and sell it in an organized and inspected manner; however, among the scrap iron transported by An Guocai this time, there were 377 complete large fishplates, and it was found that some sections of scrap rail were newly damaged." We immediately notified all districts to stop selling scrap iron and strictly prohibited damaging railway materials. We also conducted inspections on the issue of selling scrap iron, and found that Baoshufen Village and Wacun did indeed have incidents of damaging railway tracks, which the county People's Government has handled. As for the large fishplates transported and sold by An Guocai and others, they were originally intended to be sold to the Datai Coal Mine for repairing railways. They did not want them, so we allowed them to be transported to Beijing and sold to the railway department. However, we did not contact the railway department and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce beforehand, which was wrong.

Our inspection is: We contacted the Ministry of Railways in advance about how to handle the railway materials stored by farmers, but it was wrong to allow farmers to sell the scrap iron before the Ministry of Railways responded (the Ministry of Railways transferred the matter to the Tianjin Railway Administration, and it took a long time to reply). Furthermore, due to our lax management, the phenomenon of damaging national railway materials was created. This shows that our understanding and compliance with policies and laws are insufficient, which deserves our attention in the future.

There are still some complete and scrap railway materials in Wanping County, some of which are still buried in the ground. We suggest that the railway department collect these useful and scrap railway materials in a planned manner and clearly stipulate the specific handling methods for complete and scrap materials, so as to benefit national construction and avoid further losses.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应  河北宛平县工商科关于群众买卖铁路器材的检讨

　　对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    河北宛平县工商科关于群众买卖铁路器材的检讨编辑同志：
    贵报四月十六日《读者来信》栏刊登吴祥同志的《铁路器材不能随便买卖》的批评，现将我们处理情形及检讨报告如下：
    宛平县在抗日战争时期，群众曾英勇地爆破敌人交通。摧毁敌人碉堡，因此保存有铁焊子、蒺藜丝和铁道器材等物。这些器材后来大部分被军需部门收集使用，残存的为数不多，而且散在各村庄或山沟里。
    去年夏季山洪暴发，宛平受灾很重，农民因生活困难，一再要求将废铁出售。我们曾去函铁道部征询处理办法，在铁道部还没有答复我们时，群众又不断要求解决这个问题，且有偷卖现象。此时，我们认为废铁老埋在土里全烂掉可惜，群众卖了它可以度荒，且对北京市建设上也很需要，因而同意农民有组织的将废铁出售。为此，我们与北京市工商局联系，由我们将废铁运京，请北京市工商局协助检查，介绍出售。
    自一九五○年十二月至今年三月，宛平县农民经我们核准向北京市运售废铁前后共十余次，约十余吨，绝大部分是废的。后来接到北京市工商局来信说：“贵县原拟向本市运售废铁，并有组织有检查地出售；但安国才这次运来的废铁中有完整的大夹板三百七十七块，并发现有几截废铁轨是新破坏的。”我们当即通知各区停止出售废铁，并严禁破坏铁道器材。对出售废铁问题也进行检查，并查出包树坟庄、洼村确有破坏铁轨情事，县人民政府已进行处理。至于安国才等运售的大夹板，原是拟卖给大台煤矿作补修铁路用的，他们不要了，我们才准许运到北京卖给铁道部门。但事先未与铁道部门和工商局联系，这是不对的。
    我们的检讨是：农民存有铁路器材应如何处理，我们事先虽与铁道部联系过，但在铁道部未答复之前（铁道部转天津铁路管理局很长时间才答复我们），我们就准许农民将废铁出售，是不对的。更由于我们管理得不严，致造成破坏国家铁路器材现象。这说明我们对政策法令的认识、遵守不够，这是值得我们今后注意的。
    宛平县境内还有一些完整的和废了的铁道器材，有的还在土里埋藏着。我们建议铁道部门把这些有用和废了的铁道器材有计划地收集起来，并明确规定完整与废器材的具体处理办法，以便有利于国家建设，免再受损失。
        河北省宛平县人民政府工商局
