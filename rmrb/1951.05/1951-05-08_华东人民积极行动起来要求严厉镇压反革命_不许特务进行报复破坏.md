Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries in East China has become a mass movement. The people's joy and encouragement in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and their active assistance to the People's Government, are evident everywhere. When the Lun Chang Yarn Factory in Shanghai held a public trial of the local tyrant Wang Songtao, the workers were so excited that they didn't sleep all night. More than a thousand workers on the night shift rushed to participate without resting or eating after work. After the execution of a despotic landlord in Anqiu, Shandong, many peasants ate dumplings and drank celebratory wine, saying: "This is true liberation, and the land we have been allocated is secure!" At the public trial in Hudian, Northern Anhui, more than 5,000 people sat orderly on the sandy beach. When the victims tearfully recounted their suffering, everyone was filled with righteous indignation, shedding tears and shouting slogans. Chen Suying, a women's activist in the Sixth District of Nanjing, led public security personnel to arrest nine counter-revolutionaries in one night. After the Fufeng Flour Mill in Shanghai uncovered a major bombing conspiracy, the factory manager, Ye Yuanlong, said: "Special agents are poisonous snakes. If you don't hit them, they will bite you."

After the People's Government corrected the "boundless leniency" bias, and the people actively mobilized, counter-revolutionary elements became panicked and wavered. Some were forced to surrender. For example, Chen Mingfu, a bandit leader in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, said when he surrendered: "If I don't surrender, there are six ways to die: freezing to death, starving to death, running to death, falling to death climbing mountains, being forced to death by the people, and being killed by the People's Liberation Army." Some also confessed to the People's Government, providing materials on counter-revolutionary organizations, or surrendering firearms and documents. However, there are also many incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements who have changed their methods and tactics of sabotage, dispersing and concealing themselves on the one hand, retreating in order to advance, and on the other hand, carrying out retaliatory sabotage in places where our vigilance is low and defenses are weak,妄图一逞。 For example, in late March, twelve arson cases committed by special agents occurred in various parts of Southern Jiangsu.

Sun Guanggui, the People's Armed Forces Minister of Kaihua County, Zhejiang, and three others were assassinated by lurking special agents.

Tan Jincheng, Wu Guohao, and other special agents of the bandit "Chinese People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" who were lurking in the privately-owned Zhengtai Rubber Factory in Shanghai, plotted to burn the factory to the ground with gasoline.

These facts show that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries must be further strengthened, just as the people have recently reiterated: "The banner is not yet large enough," and "The suppression must be greatly strengthened in the cities."

　　华东人民积极行动起来要求严厉镇压反革命
    不许特务进行报复破坏
    【新华社上海六日电】华东区镇压反革命工作已成为群众性的运动。人民群众对于镇压反革命的欢欣鼓舞，和积极协助人民政府的行动，各地到处可见。上海纶昌纱厂公审恶霸王松涛时，工人兴奋得一晚不睡，一千多晚班工人一下班不休息不吃饭就赶去参加。山东安邱枪决恶霸地主后，许多农民吃饺子，喝喜酒，都说：这就真解放了，分得的田也牢靠了！皖北胡店的公审会上，五千多人坐在沙滩上秩序井然。当苦主控诉到伤心处，大家义愤填膺，流泪呼喊。南京市第六区妇女积极分子陈素英一个晚上即带领公安人员逮捕了九个反革命分子。上海阜丰面粉厂破获大爆炸阴谋案后，该厂经理叶元龙说：“特务是条毒蛇，你不打它，它就咬你。”
    人民政府纠正“宽大无边”的偏向，人民群众积极行动起来之后，反革命分子恐慌动摇。有的被迫投降。如浙江省台州匪首陈明甫投降时说：再不投降有六死：冻死、饿死、跑死、爬山跌死、被老百姓逼死、被解放军打死。也有向人民政府自首，并提供了反革命组织材料，或交出枪支证件的。但是，也有不少怙恶不悛的反革命分子转换了破坏活动的方法和策略，一面分散隐蔽，以退为进，一面在我警惕不高防范较差的处所，进行报复破坏活动，妄图一逞。例如，苏南区各地在三月下旬，发生特务纵火案共有十二件。
    浙江开化县人民武装部长孙官贵等四人，被潜伏的特务分子暗杀。
    潜伏在上海私营正泰橡胶厂的匪“中国人民反共救国军”特务分子谭进城、吴国浩等，曾阴谋用汽油将该厂烧光。
    这些事实说明镇压反革命的工作尚须继续加强，正如人民群众最近再度提出的：“旗鼓还不够大张”，“城市里还须大大加强镇压”。
