　　State-owned Electric Power Industry Exceeds First Quarter Targets
　　Increased Power Generation and Sales, Reduced Coal Consumption
    Under the encouragement of the great strength of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, and Defend the Country movement, all the employees of the national state-owned electric power industry have brought into play the working class's unparalleled creative power, and victoriously overfulfilled the production tasks for the first quarter of this year. Among these, power generation completed 102.39 percent of the planned target, an increase of 17.77 percent compared to the same quarter of 1950. Electricity sales completed 107.17 percent of the planned target, an increase of 29.77 percent compared to the same quarter of 1950. Significant achievements have also been made in saving consumption and reducing costs. For example, the national average power plant use rate of state-owned power plants has decreased by 9.86 percent compared to 1950; line losses have decreased by 20.74 percent compared to the original plan, and decreased by 23.69 percent compared to 1950; standard coal consumption has decreased by 14.3 percent compared to 1950. This has not only gradually reduced production costs, but also ensured a sufficient supply of electricity for industrial production and people's lives, enabling the rapid recovery and development of the national economy.

　　国营电业超额完成首季任务
    发电量售电量提高，煤耗降低
    全国国营电力工业的全体职工，在抗美援朝保家卫国伟大力量鼓舞下，发挥了工人阶级无比的创造力量，胜利地超额完成了今年第一季的生产任务。其中发电量完成了预定计划的百分之一百零二点三九，比一九五○年同季增加了百分之十七点七七。售电量完成了预定计划的百分之一百零七点一七，比一九五○年同季增加了百分之二十九点七七。在节约消耗降低成本方面也得到了很大的成绩。例如：全国国营电厂平均的厂用电率已比一九五○年降低了百分之九点八六；线路损失比原定计划降低了百分之二十点七四，比一九五○年减少了百分之二十三点六九；标准煤耗则比一九五○年降低百分之十四点三。这样不但使生产成本逐渐降低，并保证了工业生产和人民生活所需电力的充分供应，使国家经济得到迅速的恢复和发展。
