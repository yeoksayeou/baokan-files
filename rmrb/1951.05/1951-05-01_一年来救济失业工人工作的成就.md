　　Achievements in Relieving Unemployed Workers Over the Past Year
    Mao Qihua, Deputy Minister of Labor, Central People's Government
    As a result of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Labor treating the relief of unemployed workers as a political task and working hard at it, there are now 124 unemployed worker relief committees in provinces and cities across the country. As of December 1950, various measures had been taken to provide relief to unemployed workers, including: 79,439 people participating in production for self-salvation, 98,408 people returning to their hometowns for production, and 365,974 people placed in employment (the above three items are all counted as employment, totaling 543,821 people). Currently, there are 123,854 people participating in work-for-relief programs, 9,072 people undergoing vocational training, and 113,190 people simply receiving relief funds. The above totals 789,937 people, accounting for 59.7 percent of the country's unemployed workers at the time. Including family members, more than 2 million people received relief.

    The reasons for the large unemployed population in Chinese cities are the long-term aggression of imperialism and the long-term rule of domestic reactionary forces, which seriously damaged China's economy, impoverished and bankrupted the countryside, and increasingly weakened national industry. After the victory of the Liberation War, during the reorganization of the national economy in March and April of 1950, national industry and commerce faced some temporary difficulties in the adjustment process, which led to a sudden increase in the already existing unemployment situation. In particular, Shanghai was directly harmed by the bombing of imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang planes, and the difficulties were even more prominent. In the three months of March, April, and May last year alone, the number of unemployed workers increased by 150,000. It was estimated that at that time the total number of unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals in the country was about 1.5 million, and many workers were in a state of semi-unemployment. The lives of unemployed workers were extremely difficult and urgently needed relief. Employed workers were also feeling uneasy because of the impact of unemployed workers. At the same time, American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries thought that the opportunity they had been waiting for day and night had arrived, and they stepped up their espionage activities, incited workers to strike, surrounded capitalists, created dissatisfaction among unemployed workers, and advocated air-dropping food to "relieve" them. They attempted to alienate the relationship between workers and the government and the trade union, continue to expand and deepen the difficulties of industry and commerce, and further worsen unemployment, thereby creating social chaos.

    In response to this situation, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Labor, on the one hand, called on people's organizations from all walks of life across the country, especially employed workers and staff, to donate money to relieve unemployed workers; at the same time, in April, it convened an emergency meeting of the directors of the labor bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Shandong, studied the unemployment situation at the time, and proposed a "Draft of Temporary Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers." The State Council of the Central People's Government approved these measures and allocated 400 million catties of grain as a relief fund. Various localities then began to carry out the work of relieving unemployment.

    Due to the adoption of various measures to carry out the work of relieving unemployed workers, great achievements have been made:

    Developed class friendship: After the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions issued an urgent appeal for the relief of unemployed workers, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Labor, the China People's Relief Association, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions successively issued appeals and launched a mutual assistance and relief movement. As a result, a wave of donations was set off throughout the country. The vast number of employed workers enthusiastically and voluntarily carried out a voluntary one-day labor donation movement. Literary and art workers, young students, and people from all walks of life also expressed their sympathy and support through charity performances and donations, completing huge amounts of donations. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions alone received 31,285,400,432,100 yuan. In particular, the workers in Northeast China not only donated 8,366,051,624 yuan to support the unemployed workers in Shanghai, but also sent a delegation to Shanghai, giving great comfort and encouragement to the unemployed workers in Shanghai who were struggling with difficulties at the time, and strengthening their courage and confidence in overcoming difficulties. Even the People's Liberation Army, which bears the heavy responsibility of national defense, also saved on food expenses and military family rations to relieve unemployed workers, receiving 574,898,190 yuan in donations in Shanghai alone. In this way, not only did the unemployed workers receive timely material assistance and were spared from hunger, but they also received great spiritual comfort. Therefore, it greatly developed and strengthened class friendship and unity.

    Increased workers' political understanding: As a result of taking various measures for relief, not only were the difficulties in the lives of unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals considerably resolved, but the emotions of employed workers were also stabilized. The workers intimately experienced that only the people's government led by the working class would sincerely care for the lives of the workers. Some unemployed workers said: "Only our own government cares so thoughtfully. There are ways to return to the countryside, and there are ways not to return to the countryside. In the past, the reactionary Kuomintang only cared about its own corruption and enjoyment, and didn't care about the lives of us workers!" Some workers who were placed in employment said: "It's really unbelievable that you can find a job without pulling strings." Some unemployed workers, after receiving relief funds, felt that they should not sit idly by and wait for relief, and automatically participated in work-for-relief programs. Some unemployed workers also had their own solutions and knew that the government was also in difficulty, so they voluntarily did not receive relief grain. These facts all show that the working masses have deeply experienced the inseparable relationship between the People's Government and themselves. Therefore, the shameless rumors and deceptions of the traitors were also shattered by ironclad facts. Recently, unemployed workers in Shanghai held a representative meeting to resist America, aid Korea, and protect their homes and defend the country. At the meeting, they condemned the atrocities of American imperialism and passed a seven-point action program to resist America and aid Korea. More than 460 people volunteered to join military cadre schools and the people's police. It can be seen that relief work not only alleviated the personal suffering of unemployed workers, but also greatly improved their political understanding. This is a great political gain.

    Increased the prestige of the trade union: In the work of relieving unemployed workers, local trade unions at all levels and industrial trade unions fully exerted their organizational strength. Experience has proven that when relief work is carried out according to the trade union system, it is easier and more accurate to understand the situation and grasp the composition of the workers in terms of registration and review. Some cities initially entrusted the registration work to district offices or police stations, which led to bad elements such as fleeing landlords and former military officers mixing into the registration, disrupting and sabotaging the relief work, and leading the relief work astray. In addition to using newspapers, movies, radio, oral propaganda, and other methods to widely educate unemployed workers, the trade union also organized the registered unemployed workers according to industry, region, or different relief methods such as "work-for-relief" and "production for self-salvation." For example, the Shanghai Trade Union, because the addresses of handicraftsmen were scattered, organized branches by region, with ten unemployed workers forming a group, and the group leader reported every ten days, reflecting the lives, thoughts, and demands of the unemployed workers, and as a result, solved many practical problems; therefore, it was able to unite the unemployed workers around the trade union, and everyone intimately felt that the trade union was truly their best reliance, and made the employed workers understand their responsibility to help their unemployed brothers, which eliminated the antagonism between the employed and unemployed and strengthened the unity of the working class. Therefore, the trade union greatly increased its prestige among the working masses, and its organization became more consolidated and developed.

    Helped municipal construction: All localities followed the Central People's Government's relief policy of "work-for-relief as the main method," combining unemployment relief work with municipal construction. According to incomplete statistics from 43 cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Nanchang, Suzhou, and Zhangjiakou in December 1950, 123,854 unemployed workers participated in work-for-relief, carrying out municipal construction projects such as repairing roads, dredging lakes, rivers, and sewers, building railways, parks, bridges, wells, warehouses, highway subgrades and embankments, improving environmental sanitation, and quarrying. For example, Beijing repaired the earthen roads of 902 hutongs and excavated and renovated the old sewer systems of six major systems. In Shanghai, after the workers in the work-for-relief program dredged the silted Suzhou River, the citizens reflected that the dredging of the Suzhou River was an engineering project that could not be undertaken since the Qing Dynasty, especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. In particular, the renovation of Huaihai Middle Road gave the citizens a good impression. It was a well-known waterlogged area for decades. Whenever it rained or there was a high tide, the ground was covered with water, which greatly affected traffic and business operations of stores. Now, the road has been renovated to a length of 940.5 meters and a width of 14.4 meters. The entire roadbed has been raised by an average of one foot, using a total of 20,400 workdays. In addition, the slow lane on the Bund was renovated. It was originally bumpy and inconvenient for vehicles and pedestrians. After leveling and raising the ground, it was completely built with concrete. From then on, traffic flowed smoothly. In Nanjing, by the end of October, a total of 121,558 cubic meters of embankments had been repaired, 231,861 square meters of roads and bridges had been built, 19,261 cubic meters of sewers had been built, and 143,397 cubic meters of earthwork had been used to renovate gardens and rivers, changing the dilapidated city appearance that had existed for more than 20 years under the Kuomintang rule. Guangzhou City completed 253,532 cubic meters of earthwork projects, cleared 727,620 meters of river ditches, and repaired 53,620 meters of highway surfaces. The general public reflected: "Under the leadership of the People's Government, things that could not be done in the past during the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government have all been done." The implementation of these projects enabled workers to learn a new set of skills, improved the cleanliness and sanitation of the city, and improved the health of the citizens; at the same time, it also played a role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and transportation.

    Developed production organizations: Production for self-salvation work was carried out based on local needs and without affecting the original industry and commerce. As of the end of December 1950, according to statistics from 43 cities, a total of 79,439 people participated in production for self-salvation, organizing more than ten types of production units such as rubber, cloth shoes, bedding, woodenware, textiles, coal briquettes, wasteland reclamation, kiln firing, hardware, toothbrushes, drawnwork embroidery, etc. The main methods of production for self-salvation were to organize processing factories, cooperatives, or production teams. In Shanghai, 16 production for self-salvation factories were organized under the leadership of the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, with loans of 1.13 billion yuan, absorbing up to 9,897 unemployed workers to participate. Guangzhou organized 70 production for self-salvation units, with a total of more than 1,000 people participating in production. The Xi'an Anlao Shoe Factory, organized with the help of the Northwest Labor Department, had management personnel democratically elected by the employees, and implemented a piece-rate wage system. Due to the active efforts of all employees, attention to economy, high output, good quality, and smooth sales, it had grown from more than 50 people to more than 450 people and had made considerable profits. In addition, Wuhan, Jinan, Tianjin, Changsha, and other places also organized similar production for self-salvation units, solving many problems. Secondly, some places helped workers in factories that had stopped work and closed down to restore production by using the original machinery and buildings and providing loans, such as Shanghai's "Angel Milk Powder Factory" and Guangzhou's Da Zhonghua Cigarette Factory and Lianhe Cloth Factory. There were also some cities that were more closely related to the countryside, cooperating with local product companies and cooperatives to participate in transportation and engage in purchasing and sales, strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance, and promoting the exchange of materials. Due to the launch of the above-mentioned production for self-salvation work, the scattered unemployed workers were organized to produce, which not only enabled the unemployed workers to have a means of livelihood, but also improved their production skills and cultivated some talents for managing and managing factories.

    Cultivated worker cadres: Unemployed Workers Relief Committees in various localities used methods such as opening political and cultural study classes and vocational training classes to carry out a lot of work among the unemployed workers. Therefore, the political, cultural, and technical levels of unemployed workers were improved, and many worker cadres were trained for unemployed workers relief work, cultural education, land reform, and national defense construction. In Shanghai, a total of 27,254 people participated in learning in the past seven months. In the organizations that carried out relief for 100,000 unemployed workers, in addition to 87 cadres drawn from various agencies, the remaining more than 1,700 cadres were cultivated from unemployed workers. More than 70% of the cadres of the Nanjing Unemployed Workers Relief Committee were selected from active elements among unemployed workers. In Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Tangshan, and other places, workers were selected as the backbone to handle unemployment relief work. Because unemployed workers are most likely to understand the pain and demands of unemployed workers themselves, the methods they propose are relatively fair, reasonable, and practical, so it is easy to gain the trust of the unemployed workers. At the same time, it can make the unemployed workers realize that relief work is everyone's business and must be done by everyone, which can improve their sense of ownership. This overcame the difficulty that relief work could not be done well at that time because there were no cadres. Not only that, due to the development of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect the country and defend the home, unemployed workers were educated in patriotism and internationalism, and many unemployed workers automatically signed up to participate in military cadre schools, volunteer troops, transportation teams, and people's public security forces; many also participated in technical training classes in driving, nursing, machinery, etc., preparing to better serve the motherland.

    The achievements mentioned above should first be attributed to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and are also inseparable from the joint efforts of the Party, government, trade unions, trade unions at all levels, and labor bureaus in various localities, as well as the sympathy and support of all sectors of society, especially employed workers. The reason why such achievements can be achieved is mainly because we regard the relief of unemployed workers as a policy of national protection of labor and as a part of the entire economic construction plan; therefore, when implementing relief, it is not simply disaster relief, but is combined with production to fundamentally solve the problem of unemployment. Judging from the relief figures, placement in employment, return to hometown production, work-for-relief, production for self-salvation, and vocational training account for 86%, while pure relief accounts for only 14%. This is completely different from the view of the ruling class in capitalist countries that treats the relief of unemployed workers as a "gift" and "charity." In terms of relief methods, it relies on trade union organizations and relies on the unemployed workers themselves to handle the work of relieving unemployed workers. In this way, it can strengthen the unity of the working class, exert organizational strength, and learn to manage enterprises and manage state affairs. This is also completely different from the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, which used unemployed workers to provoke the relationship between employed and unemployed workers and adopted a divisive policy.

    In the process of one year of relief work, there were also many shortcomings: Some places did not rely well on the trade union and the masses of unemployed workers, and felt that the work could not be carried out; or a large number of cadres were drawn from various agencies, the organization was large, and the work progressed slowly. Some did not pay enough attention to unemployment relief work and lacked specific plans. Some existed without investigation and research, and randomly spent relief grain. The wages for some work-for-relief programs were calculated on a daily basis and distributed equally, which affected work efficiency; some were set too high, exceeding the wage level of general employed workers. Some places took a hands-off approach when mobilizing people to return to their hometowns for production, causing the unemployed workers to have no livelihood after returning to their hometowns, and therefore returning to the city. In terms of production for self-salvation, some lacked investigation and research and neglected leadership and inspection, which led to the phenomenon of collapsing as soon as they were organized, while others distributed production funds to individuals for management in a piecemeal manner, resulting in complete losses and requests for relief. Although these shortcomings have been gradually corrected, our failure to pay attention to leadership in a timely manner has caused undue losses to the relief work.

    Due to the improvement of the national financial and economic situation and the gradual recovery of various production and construction undertakings, many unemployed workers have obtained employment opportunities, and the number of unemployed has been greatly reduced. As of the end of December 1950, there were still 610,000 unemployed workers nationwide (including those receiving relief). According to the needs of national economic construction in 1951, 310,000 more skilled workers are needed. This shows that under the new democratic regime led by the working class, the problem of worker unemployment can and must be gradually solved.

    However, to fundamentally eliminate the phenomenon of unemployment nationwide, it depends on the fundamental improvement of the national financial and economic situation. Therefore, we should consolidate past achievements, summarize experience, continue to strengthen organizational leadership, and further improve the work of relieving unemployed workers. In the future, the focus of the work of relieving unemployed workers should generally be placed on vocational training, and various talents should be cultivated in a planned way according to the needs of national construction. At the same time, we should also pay attention to improving the work of labor exchanges, mastering the supply and demand of labor, so as to systematically transfer unemployed workers to various jobs.

　　一年来救济失业工人工作的成就
    中央人民政府劳动部副部长  毛齐华
    中央人民政府劳动部把救济失业工人看做是一个政治任务而努力的结果，现在全国各省、市已有一百二十四个失业工人救济委员会。截至一九五○年十二月止，采取各种办法救济失业工人，计：参加生产自救者七万九千四百三十九人，还乡生产者九万八千四百零八人，介绍就业者三十六万五千九百七十四人（上述三项都以就业论，共计五十四万三千八百二十一人）。目前正在救济中的，计有参加以工代赈者十二万三千八百五十四人，转业训练者九千零七十二人，单纯领救济金者十一万三千一百九十人。以上总计七十八万九千九百三十七人。占全国当时失业工人的百分之五十九点七。如包括家属在内，得到救济的在二百万人以上。
    造成中国城市中广大失业群的原因，是由于帝国主义的长期侵略与国内反动势力的长期统治，使中国经济遭受了严重的破坏，农村贫困破产，民族工业日益衰落。解放战争胜利以后的一九五○年三、四月间，又因国民经济的改组，全国工商业在调整过程中面临一些暂时的困难，致使原已存在的失业情况骤形增加，尤以上海被帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮飞机的轰炸，工商业遭受到直接危害，困难表现得更为突出，仅去年三、四、五三个月中，就增加了失业工人十五万人。估计当时全国失业工人与失业知识分子的总数约有一百五十万人，并有不少工人处于半失业状态。失业工人的生活极为困难，迫切需要救济。而在业工人亦因受失业工人的影响而感到不安。同时，美帝国主义和国民党反动派却以为它们朝夕盼望的时机已经到来，加紧特务活动，鼓动工人罢工，包围资本家，在失业工人中制造不满情绪，并鼓吹要空投粮食来“救济”。企图离间工人与政府、工会的关系，继续扩大与加深工商业的困难，使失业更加恶化，从而造成社会紊乱。
    中央人民政府劳动部针对此种情况，一面号召全国社会各界人民团体，特别是在业工人和职员，捐款救济失业工人；同时，于四月间召开了北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、山东劳动局局长紧急会议，研究了当时的失业情况，并提出“救济失业工人暂行办法草案”。中央人民政府政务院批准了这一办法，并拨出了四亿斤粮食作为救济基金。各地随即开始进行了救济失业的工作。
    由于采取各种办法展开救济失业工人的工作，获得了很大的成绩：
    发挥了阶级友爱：当上海总工会为救济失业工人发出迫切呼吁后，中央人民政府劳动部、中国人民救济总会、中华全国总工会等都相继发出了号召，展开互助救济的运动。于是在全国普遍地掀起了捐献热潮。广大的在业工人热烈地自觉自愿地进行了义务献工一日运动，文艺工作者、青年学生、以及社会各界也以义演、捐款等各种方式表达出同情和支援，完成了巨额捐款，仅中华全国总工会收到的即达三百一十二亿八千五百四十万零四千三百二十一元。特别是东北工人，不但捐助了八十三亿六千六百零五万一千六百二十四元支援上海失业工人，并派慰问团赴上海，给当时正在与困难搏斗中的上海失业工人以极大的安慰和鼓励，加强了战胜困难的勇气和信心。甚至负担国防重任的人民解放军，亦以高度的兄弟般的友爱，节省伙食费和军属粮来救济失业工人，在上海一地就收到他们的捐款五亿七千四百八十九万八千一百九十元。这样，不仅使失业工人及时的得到了物质的援助，免于饥饿，而且在精神上也得到很大的慰藉。因此，亦就大大地发挥和加强了阶级友爱和团结。
    增进了工人的政治认识：由于采取各种办法救济之后，不但使失业工人、失业知识分子生活上的困难得到相当的解决，并且也安定了在业工人的情绪。工人们亲切地体验到只有工人阶级领导的人民政府，才会真心实意地照顾工人的生活。有的失业工人说：“只有自己的政府，才关心得这样周到，回乡有回乡的办法，不回乡有不回乡的办法，要在过去反动的国民党，只管自己贪污享受，那管咱工人死活！”有些被介绍就业的工人说：“不钻门子，就可以找到职业，真是梦想不到的事。”有些失业工人领到救济金以后，觉得不应坐等救济，自动参加以工代赈的工作。有的失业工人自己还有办法，知道政府也很困难，也就自动不领救济粮。这些事实都说明了工人群众已深深体验到人民政府与自己有血肉不可分离的关系。所以，匪特无耻的造谣欺骗，挑拨离间，也就被铁一般的事实所击破。最近上海失业工人开了一次抗美援朝保家卫国代表会议，会上纷纷控诉美帝国主义的暴行，并通过抗美援朝的行动纲领七项，志愿参加军事干部学校及人民警察者达四百六十多人。可见救济工作不仅减轻了失业工人的切身苦痛，而且使失业工人的政治认识也大大提高了。这是政治上很大的收获。
    提高了工会威信：在救济失业工人的工作进行中，各级地方工会与各产业工会充分发挥了组织力量。经验证明，凡是按照工会系统进行救济工作的，在登记审查方面，对于工人的情况了解、成份掌握，就比较容易而且正确。有的城市最初把登记工作委托给区公所或派出所办理，以致有逃亡地主、旧军官等坏分子混入登记，捣乱破坏，使救济工作走了弯路。工会除利用报纸、电影、广播、口头宣传等办法，广泛地对失业工人进行教育外，并将已登记的失业工人按业别、按地区，或按“以工代赈”“生产自救”等不同的救济方式把失业工人分别组织起来。如上海工会，因手工业工人住址分散，就按地区组织分会，每十个失业工人组成一小组，十天举行一次小组长汇报，反映失业工人的生活、思想、要求等情况，结果解决了不少实际问题；所以，就能将失业工人团结在工会的周围，每个人都亲切地感到工会真正是自己最好的依靠，并使在业职工明白自己对失业弟兄有帮助的责任，就消除了在业与失业间的对立，加强了工人阶级的团结。因此，工会在工人群众中大大提高了威信，组织更加巩固和发展。
    帮助了市政建设：各地遵循了中央人民政府“以工代赈为主”的救济方针，使失业救济工作与市政建设相结合。据上海、北京、南京、天津、武汉、广州、重庆、成都、西安、南昌、苏州、张家口等四十三个城市一九五○年十二月份不完全的统计，有十二万三千八百五十四名失业工人参加了以工代赈，进行了翻修马路、疏浚湖河及下水道，修建铁路、公园、桥梁、水井、仓库、公路路基和堤岸，改进环境卫生及采石等项市政建设工程。例如：北京修整了九百零二条胡同的土路，掏挖整修了六大系统的旧下水道。上海以工代赈工人挖通了淤滞的苏州河后，市民反映说：苏州河的修浚在前清以来，尤其国民党反动统治时代是无法举办的工程。特别是淮海中路的修整给予市民以良好的影响。那是数十年来有名的积水地带，每逢雨季或大潮汛，遍地是水，影响交通和商店营业甚大，现经翻修该路长达九百四十点五公尺，宽十四点四公尺，全部路基平均约加高一英尺，共用二万零四百个工作日。此外，又进行了外滩慢车道的修整，原来坎坷不平，行车走路均感不便，经平高垫低，全部用混凝土筑成，从此，车马畅行。在南京，至十月底止，计完成培修堤岸十二万一千五百五十八公方，修筑道路及桥梁二十三万一千八百六十一平方公尺，下水道一万九千二百六十一公方，修整园林、河川计土方十四万三千三百九十七公方，改变了国民党统治二十多年来破旧不堪的市容。广州市完成土方工程二十五万三千五百三十二立方公尺，清河沟七十二万七千六百二十公尺，修整公路面五万三千六百二十公尺。广大市民反映：“在人民政府领导下把过去满清及国民党反动政府时代未能作到的事都作到了”。这些工程的举办，使工人学会了一套新的技术，并改善了市内的清洁卫生，增进了市民的健康；同时对城乡物资交流运输上也起了不少的作用。
    发展了生产组织：生产自救工作是根据当地需要，在不影响原有工商业的基础上开展起来的，截至一九五○年十二月底止，根据四十三个城市的统计，共有七万九千四百三十九人参加生产自救，组织了橡胶、布鞋、被服、木器、纺织、煤球、垦荒、烧窑、五金、牙刷、挑花刺绣等十几种生产单位。生产自救的主要的方式是组织加工工厂、合作社或生产小组。在上海由失业工人救济委员会领导组织了十六个生产自救工厂，贷给资金十一亿零三百多万元，最多时吸收到九千八百九十七名失业工人参加。广州组织了七十个生产自救单位，共计有一千余人参加生产。西安按劳鞋厂，由西北劳动部帮助组织，管理人员由职工民主选出，实行计件工资制，由于全体职工积极努力，注意节约，产量多，质量好，销路又畅，已有五十余人扩大到四百五十余人，且获得不少盈利。此外，武汉、济南、天津、长沙等地也组织了类似的生产自救单位，解决了不少问题。其次，有些地方帮助停工歇业的工厂工人，利用原有的机器房屋，贷给资金，恢复生产，如上海的“安琪儿奶粉厂”，广州的大中国烟厂、联合布厂。还有些与农村关系比较密切的城市，配合土产公司、合作社，参加运输，搞收购和推销的工作，加强城乡互助，促进物资交流。由于以上各种生产自救工作的展开，把分散的失业工人组织起来生产，不仅使得失业工人有了生活依靠，而且还提高了生产技术和培养了一些经营管理工厂的人才。
    培养了工人干部：各地失业工人救济委员会，用开办政治、文化学习班和转业训练班等方式，在失业工人群众中进行了不少工作。因此，提高了失业工人的政治、文化技术水平，培养了很多救济失业工人工作、文化教育、土地改革以及国防建设等工人干部。上海七个月来，参加学习的共计二万七千二百五十四人，在进行救济十万失业工人的机构中，除从各机关抽调八十七名干部外，其余一千七百多名干部，都是从失业工人中培养出来的。南京失业工人救济委员会的干部百分之七十以上是从失业工人中选拔的积极分子。在武汉、广州、成都、唐山等地选拔工人做骨干，办理失业救济工作。因为失业工人最容易了解失业工人自己的痛苦和要求，因而所提出的办法也比较公平合理而切合实际，所以也就容易取得失业工人群众的信任。同时，可使失业工人认识到救济工作是大家的事，必须大家来办，就可提高其主人翁的思想。这样才克服了当时没有干部搞不好救济工作的困难。不仅如此，由于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的开展，失业工人受了爱国主义与国际主义的思想教育，不少失业工人自动报名参加军事干部学校、志愿部队、运输队、人民公安部队；也有很多参加驾驶、护士、机械等技术训练班，准备更好的为祖国效力。
    以上成绩的获得，首先应归功于毛主席、中央人民政府正确的领导，同时也和各地党、政、工、各级工会与劳动局及其他有关部门干部的共同努力，以及社会各界特别是在业工人的同情和支援分不开的。所以能获得这样的成绩，主要是由于我们把救济失业工人看做国家保护劳动的一种政策，是整个经济建设计划中的一个部分；因此在实行救济时，不是单纯的放赈，而是与生产结合，从根本上去解决失业问题。就以救济数字看，介绍就业、还乡生产、以工代赈、生产自救、转业训练占百分之八十六，而单纯救济的仅占百分之十四。这与资本主义国家的统治阶级把救济失业工人当作“恩赐”与“慈善”的观点，绝不相同。在救济方式上，是依靠工会组织，依靠失业工人自己来办理救济失业工人的工作。这样就能加强工人阶级团结，发挥组织力量，学会管理企业和管理国家事务。这与国民党反动统治时代，利用失业工人挑拨在业工人与失业工人之间的关系，采取分裂政策，也是完全不同的。
    在一年救济工作过程中，也有不少缺点：有的地方没有很好的依靠工会和失业工人群众，感到工作展不开；或是从各机关抽调了大批干部，机构庞大，工作进行反而迟缓。有的对失业救济工作重视不够，缺乏具体的计划。有的则存在着不调查研究而乱开支救济粮。有的以工代赈的工资，一律按日计工，平均发给，影响工作效率；有的则规定过高，超过了一般在业工人的工资水平。有的地方在动员还乡生产时，采取推出门不管的态度，致使失业工人还乡后生活无着，因而重返城市。在生产自救方面，有的是缺乏调查研究，又疏于领导检查，以致发生组织起来即垮台的现象，有的则将生产资金零星地发给个人经营，结果赔光耗尽，又请求救济。这些缺点，虽已逐渐纠正，但由于我们未能及时注意领导，使救济工作受到不应有的损失。
    由于国家财政经济状况开始好转，各种生产建设事业逐渐恢复，不少失业工人得到了就业的机会，失业数字已大大减少，截至一九五○年十二月底止，全国（包括正在救济的在内）尚有六十一万失业工人。根据一九五一年国家经济建设需要，仅技术工人一项，即需增加三十一万人。这就说明：在工人阶级领导的新民主主义政权下，工人失业的问题，是一定可以逐渐解决，而且必须解决的。
    但是要在全国范围基本消灭失业现象，则有待于国家财政经济状况的根本好转。因此，应巩固已往的成绩，总结经验，继续加强组织领导，进一步做好救济失业工人的工作。今后救济失业工人的工作，重点一般应放在转业训练上，根据国家建设需要，有计划地培养各种人才。同时，亦应注意健全劳动介绍所的工作，掌握劳动力的供求情况，以便有步骤地将失业工人输送到各种工作岗位上去。
