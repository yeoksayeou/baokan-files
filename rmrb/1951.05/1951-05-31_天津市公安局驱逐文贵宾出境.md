Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th - The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau deported the imperialist element Wen Guibin (French nationality) on the 28th. Based on the accusations of patriotic Catholics in the city and the demands of the broad masses of the people, the Municipal Public Security Bureau investigated and summoned Wen Guibin a few days ago. After confirming Wen Guibin's criminal facts, the Municipal Public Security Bureau announced his deportation.

Wen Guibin's confession is as follows:

"I admit the following mistakes:

	One, regarding the Xu Shuqiang property issue, I concealed the property of the traitor Xu Shuqiang and did not report it to the government. I admit my mistake.
	Two, Father Liu Yimin organized reactionary armed forces during the Kuomintang period (Editor's note: namely the Catholic Youth National Salvation Corps), which harmed the Chinese people. I did not remove his priestly authority or give him any punishment within the Church.
	Three, the Society of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart was organized by me in Tianjin.
	Four, French Father Siyi Fang acted as an American spy, and I did not punish him within the Church.
	Five, Belgian Father Lebbe established the special service organization "People's National Construction Advancement Association" in Tianjin, and I did not stop church members from participating.
	Six, I opposed the reform movement and personally drafted the "Statement of All Catholic Bishops in China," and sent it to Li Peili in Nanjing for printing and distribution.
	Seven, I distributed pamphlets such as "How Catholics Should Deal with the Communists," "Terrorist Communism," "Study Reference," and "The Holy and Apostolic Church" that opposed the Chinese People's Government and the reform movement.
					Wen Guibin (signed)	May 25, 1951"

Note: Wen Guibin came to China in 1901 and served as the Bishop of the Tianjin Diocese of the Catholic Church from 1922. During the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan, he shielded Japanese spies Taguchi and Iwashita, and ordered the churches in various counties under the Tianjin Diocese to provide the Japanese invaders with information and help the Japanese invaders attack the anti-Japanese base areas. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he turned to the American imperialists and colluded with the Kuomintang bandits, carrying out the following activities that seriously harmed the interests of the Chinese people: (1) Actively supporting the espionage activities of American spies such as Shang Jianxun of Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church in Xianxian County; (2) Encouraging French Father Siyi Fang to act as an American spy and collect intelligence on the Chinese People's Liberation Areas for American imperialism; (3) Helping international spy Lebbe and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Jin Yupei and others develop a special service organization among Catholics - the People's National Construction Advancement Association; (4) Supporting Lebbe, Liu Yimin and others to organize the reactionary armed forces - the Catholic Youth National Salvation Corps, attacking the Chinese People's Liberation Areas, killing Chinese people, and plundering the Chinese people's property. After the liberation of Tianjin, Wen Guibin actively led and developed the reactionary core organization within the Catholic Church - the Society of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, using it to control believers, spread rumors, and oppose the People's Government. After the patriotic Catholics in Tianjin launched the reform movement this year, Wen Guibin did everything possible to sabotage it, abusing so-called "priestly authority" to intimidate and punish patriotic Catholics. The people of all walks of life in Tianjin and patriotic Catholics could no longer tolerate this imperialist element and demanded that he be deported. The Municipal Public Security Bureau accepted this just demand and summoned Wen Guibin on the 25th. He confessed to the above-mentioned crimes one by one, and the Public Security Bureau ruled to deport him according to law and executed it on the 28th.

　　天津市公安局驱逐文贵宾出境
    【新华社天津三十日电】天津市人民政府公安局，已于二十八日驱逐帝国主义分子文贵宾（法籍）出境。市公安局根据本市爱国天主教徒的控诉及广大人民的要求，经过调查，日前传讯了文贵宾。在证实了文贵宾的犯罪事实后，市公安局已宣布驱逐其出境。
    文贵宾的供词如下：
    “我承认下列的错误：
    一、徐树强财产问题，我曾隐匿汉奸徐树强财产未向政府报告，我承认错误。
    二、刘益民神父在国民党时期组织反动武装部队（编者按：即公教青年报国团），有害中国人民。我没有摘他的神权及在教内给予任何处罚。
    三、圣母御侍团是我在天津组织的。
    四、法籍神父司仪芳曾作美国间谍，我没有在教内给他惩罚。
    五、比籍神父雷震远在天津成立特务组织民众建国协进会，我没有阻止教友们参加。
    六、我曾反对革新运动，亲笔起草《天主教中国全体主教声明》，送给南京黎培里印发。
    七、我曾散发《天主教怎样对付共产党》、《恐怖的共产主义》、《学习参考》、《圣而公教会》等反对中国人民政府、反对革新运动的小册子。
            文贵宾（签字）    一九五一、五、二五、”
    按：文贵宾于一九○一年来华，从一九二二年起任天主教天津教区的主教。他曾在中国人民抗日战争期间，掩护日本特务田口、岩下等进行间谍活动，并命令天津教区所属各县教堂供给日寇情报，帮助日寇进攻抗日根据地。日寇投降后，他转而投靠美帝国主义，与国民党匪帮相勾结，进行了下列严重损害中国人民利益的活动：（一）积极地支持献县张家庄天主堂美国间谍尚建勋等的间谍活动；（二）鼓励法籍神父司仪芳充当美国间谍，为美帝国主义搜集中国人民解放区的情报；（三）帮助国际间谍雷震远和蒋匪特务金玉培等在天主教徒中发展特务组织——民众建国协进会；（四）支持雷震远、刘益民等组织反动武装部队——公教青年报国团，进攻中国人民解放区，杀害中国人民，抢掠中国人民的资财。天津解放后，文贵宾又积极地领导和发展天主教内部的反动核心组织——圣母御侍团，利用它来控制教徒，传布谣言，反对人民政府。今年天津市爱国的天主教徒展开革新运动后，文贵宾更百般进行破坏。滥用所谓“神权”，恐吓和处罚爱国的天主教徒。天津市各界人民和爱国的天主教徒对于这个帝国主义分子已不能容忍，纷纷要求将他驱逐出境。市公安局接受此一正义要求，于二十五日传讯文贵宾。他对于上述罪行一一供认，公安局乃依法判决将其驱逐出境，并于二十八日执行。
