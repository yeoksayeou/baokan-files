　　During the celebration of the great "May Day" Labor Day, people from all over the country showed ardent love for their leader, the creator and leader of New China - Chairman Mao. Millions of letters written with the most beautiful, affectionate, and touching words, filled with sincere feelings of tribute, were sent to Chairman Mao in Beijing, the capital of the people's motherland, from every city exuding prosperity, from the vast countryside covered in green, from the distant borders of the motherland, and from the ethnic minority areas of the snow-covered Tianshan Plateau. The working class, the backbone of New China's construction, dedicated the honor of their victories on the production front to Chairman Mao. The trade union of Shaoyang Electric Company in Hunan, one of the three typical trade unions in the Central South District, said in its letter of tribute: "Respected Chairman Mao: Our production task for the first quarter has been overfulfilled. During the spring overhaul, our work efficiency increased by 25%; the original quota of 5 kilograms of coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was saved to 4.72 kilograms; cylinder oil consumption was reduced by 15%, and line losses were reduced by 3.5%. Our trade union has been listed as one of the three typical trade unions in the Central South District. This glory is given to us by you and the Communist Party! Under your banner, we must continue to move forward!"
　　All the workers who are building the flood storage dam project in the middle reaches of the Huai River for the happiness of tens of millions of people said in their letter of tribute to Chairman Mao: "In order to eradicate the water disasters left behind by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and for the happiness of our future generations, you issued the call to harness the Huai River. We know that this task is arduous and great and has extremely important significance for the economic construction of New China and the opposition to American imperialist aggression, so each of us is working with great intensity and joy, striving to do it well, quickly, and economically."
　　The common will of the people of all walks of life throughout the country to defend the motherland, oppose American aggression, and defend world peace is condensed in their letters and telegrams of tribute to Chairman Mao, the banner of victory of New China. The telegram of tribute from the people of all walks of life in eastern Sichuan celebrating the "May Day" Labor Day said: "In our eastern Sichuan area, 8,420,000 people have signed the declaration supporting the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact, and we will further strive to oppose American aggression and defend world peace!"
