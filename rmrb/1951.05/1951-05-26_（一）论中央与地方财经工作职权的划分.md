(I) On the Division of Financial and Economic Work Authority between the Central and Local Governments

The State Council passed the "Decision on the Division of Management Authority between the Central and Local Governments in Financial and Economic Work" on May 4th. This decision is correct and timely, and it has positive significance in promoting the progress of national financial and economic work.

The "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work" promulgated by the State Council on March 3rd of last year was entirely necessary and correct at that time. Why is it now necessary to divide financial and economic management authority? Why is this decision correct and timely again? There are reasons for this. First: Last year, unification was carried out on the basis of decentralized management; this year, a proper division is made on the basis of unification. In the "Decision on Unifying National Financial and Economic Work," the State Council pointed out: "Due to the difficulties in the financial situation, the disconnection of revenue and expenditure agencies, and the instability of finance and prices, we must have further unification. After the allocation of public grain and taxes to the unified control of the Central People's Government, the difficulty in local expenditure may occur compared with the past. However, it should be assumed that this difficulty is much smaller in degree and consequence than the difficulty caused by the continued lack of unified national financial and economic management and the chaos of finance and prices. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the principle of the part obeying the whole, and the local obeying the central government, and to rather endure some minor difficulties in order to prevent and avoid greater difficulties." The facts of the past year or so have proved that emphasizing unification at that time was very necessary. Great difficulties have been avoided, and the country's financial and economic work has made great progress. However, in local work, some minor difficulties have indeed arisen due to last year's financial and economic unification, which has, to varying degrees, restricted the enthusiasm of local work. These minor difficulties should be appropriately resolved while ensuring and consolidating unification. The implementation of the three-level financial system and the division of central and local industries have proved that these minor difficulties can be resolved. Second: Last year, in the process of unifying national financial and economic work, due to insufficient experience, it now appears that the central government managed some work too much. For example, in state-owned trade work, there was no distinction between businesses with a larger national proportion and businesses with a larger local proportion, and all were vertically led by various national specialized companies. This restricted the role of "adapting to local conditions" in some businesses with a larger local proportion, especially in guiding the production and sales of local products. Now, with more than a year of experience, it is possible to gradually distinguish which businesses have a larger national proportion and which businesses have a larger local proportion, and thus appropriately divide the management responsibilities of the central and local governments according to the business conditions of different departments. Third: For enterprises under the central government's centralized management but scattered in various places, such as central government-directly managed industries and mines, railways, banks, state-owned trading companies, etc., the leadership and management work of these scattered enterprises did not clearly stipulate which powers belonged to the central government and which powers belonged to the local governments. This made it difficult for local authorities to intervene in the enterprises directly managed by the central government in their regions. Facts have proved that political work in enterprises cannot be directly managed well by various central departments without the leadership of local authorities. Now, there is a need to clearly divide the powers of the central and local governments in terms of leadership, management, supervision, guidance, assistance, etc., for enterprises directly managed by the central government and scattered in various places. Fourth: The situation in our country is that it is a vast country with a large population and underdeveloped transportation. It is still in a period of great revolutionary change. Many things need to be managed by local governments, and the central financial and economic departments must concentrate their efforts on grasping the direction, policies, and plans of the national financial and economic work and leading the main tasks. Therefore, it is now correct and timely to propose that the management authority of the central and local governments should be gradually and appropriately divided in various financial and economic departments according to the different circumstances in which management must be centralized and should be decentralized.

The division of authority between the central and local governments is based on the principle of democratic centralism, "so that it is conducive to both national unity and adapting to local conditions" (Article 16 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference). Therefore, it guarantees the implementation of the national unified policies, guidelines, plans, and important systems in financial and economic work, and at the same time, it allocates a portion of the management authority of state-owned enterprises that is suitable for local management to the local governments. The powers allocated to local governments are roughly divided into two categories: First, a portion of state-owned enterprises or a portion of financial and economic businesses are entirely allocated to local management, such as local industry, local finance, local trade, local transportation, etc. In these businesses, except for ensuring the national unity of policies, guidelines, important plans, and important systems, all management work and all political work are entirely the responsibility of the local governments. Second, for enterprises directly managed by the central financial and economic departments and scattered in various places, all political work is under the leadership of the local authorities designated by the People's Government of the Greater Administrative Region. These enterprises must be supervised, guided, and assisted by the local authorities in carrying out the tasks assigned by the higher authorities. This division is in line with the above principles. Why is all political work handed over to local leadership? It must be emphasized here that the implementation of policies, guidelines, plans, and systems in any enterprise must go through management work, and management work must be carried out by people. This requires relying on political work—the education, organization, and mobilization of personnel, etc. China is so large, and our state-owned enterprises are scattered all over the country. How can the central financial and economic departments understand the personnel situation in each enterprise—ideological situation, political situation, work situation, work attitude, etc.? Facts have proved that these tasks cannot be done without relying on local governments. However, the major administrative regions and provinces and cities across the country have thousands of cadres who rely on them to do political work for various state-owned enterprises, and this force is very strong. Therefore, all political work in state-owned enterprises must completely rely on local governments. However, all political work must ensure the implementation of policies and guidelines, ensure the realization of production plans, ensure the completion of business plans, and ensure the implementation of important systems. Therefore, political work must be centered on production and centered on business. It is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of political work being divorced from production and divorced from business. To this end, the local authorities must grasp the specific businesses of industry, transportation, commerce, banks... and the leaders of state-owned enterprises scattered in various places must regularly report their business and work to the local authorities to obtain their timely and correct leadership and assistance.

Why should the decisions made at important professional meetings convened by the central financial and economic ministries, departments, and banks solicit the opinions of the Greater Administrative Regions in advance and obtain the consent of the Greater Administrative Regions afterward? This is because widely soliciting the opinions of lower levels makes the decisions more complete and smoother to implement. This is the concrete application of the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses" that Chairman Mao has often taught us.

This decision fully implements the spirit that leading organs must follow the mass line, and it provides a profound education for the staff of the financial and economic departments in particular. People often make the mistake of overestimating their personal strength and relatively ignoring the strength of the collective and the masses; often overestimating their personal achievements and relatively ignoring the surrounding conditions and the role of others in achieving success. Facts have proved that over the past year or so, every staff member of the financial and economic departments, like the staff members of other departments, has done a lot of work and has made certain achievements. However, whether it is in unifying financial and economic work, adjusting industry and commerce, or adjusting taxation, the main reasons for achieving success are: First, the correct leadership of the central government, which is manifested in the timely and correct proposal of tasks, the proposal of guidelines, and the proposal of methods, the concentration of the opinions of the masses, and the persistence in it. Second, the reason why the decrees of the Central People's Government can be implemented is due to the concerted efforts of party organizations, governments, and people's organizations at all levels, and the support of the people throughout the country. For example, in the work of tax collection, if there is no work to adjust industry and commerce, no work for urban-rural exchanges, no work to adjust taxation, no work for local governments at all levels to investigate and evaluate, and no work for industrial and commercial groups to compete in tax payment, how can the tax authorities alone achieve such great progress? The main sign that the People's Government is different from any government in the history of our country is manifested here. Third, the country's financial and economic work is very complicated, all tasks are closely related, and the tasks are very arduous. And all our financial and economic staff have only had a short period of more than a year to practice national New Democratic financial and economic work. From this point of view, the work of each of our financial and economic staff has only begun to explore and learn. Therefore, only by obtaining the supervision, guidance, and assistance of governments at all levels across the country and all the people can we reduce the difficulties in our work and accelerate the progress of our work. Only by learning from the masses and learning from all experienced people can we gradually understand the laws of our own existence in various businesses of financial and economic work, and can we greatly deepen our work. For more than a year, the leaders of state-owned enterprises scattered in various places have mostly had good relations with the local authorities and have obtained their supervision, guidance, and assistance, so that their work has achieved due results. However, due to the lack of clear division of leadership authority between the central and local governments over state-owned enterprises scattered in various places in the past, some leaders of state-owned enterprises do not fully understand the above principles, do not obey the leadership of the local authorities, or more or less engage in independence from the local authorities. This is very harmful to the work and must be corrected.

The purpose of the central and local governments' specific division of financial and economic work management authority is that doing so is beneficial to the people and beneficial to the work. Therefore, when starting the division, it needs to be appropriate, and the division also needs steps. Don't mess it up. After the division, it is not forever fixed. As the national economy develops, if at a certain period, more concentration is beneficial to the people and beneficial to the work, governments at all levels will naturally support more concentration. Therefore, this division will never affect the necessary concentration of certain matters in a certain period. Will this division hinder unification? No, because the decision repeatedly states that necessary division is carried out on the basis of unification, and it also reminds local authorities to pay attention to the fact that in grasping financial and economic work, they must proceed from comprehensiveness and integrity. To this end, the following two things must be emphasized: First, the interests of a certain place and a certain time must be subordinate to the overall and long-term interests. Financial and economic construction is a complex and long-term task, and national industrialization is a long-term construction process. Therefore, the state must, in specific measures for construction work, proceed in order of priority and urgency according to conditions such as financial resources, human resources, and resources, grasp the key points, and proceed in steps. On this point, it may conflict with the temporary interests of some places. To resolve this contradiction, we require the central financial and economic departments to regularly report the national financial and economic situation to the local authorities so that the comrades working in the local governments can regularly contact national issues. At the same time, we also require the local authorities to always proceed from the overall and long-term perspective when considering local issues. Second, it is necessary to ensure the implementation of all business guidelines, plans, and important systems, and ensure unification and implement unification. In order to implement this, the local authorities must be familiar with the production status and business status of various enterprises, and grasp it. Otherwise, it will be impossible to correctly realize the tasks of supervision, guidance, and assistance, and it will be difficult to guarantee the correct implementation of all business guidelines, plans, and important systems. Therefore, this decision on dividing the management authority of the central and local governments in financial and economic work actually adds to the tasks of the local authorities, and makes the central and local governments share the responsibility for national financial and economic work. We believe that the local authorities will definitely regard the leadership of state-owned enterprises in political work and the supervision, guidance, and assistance in business as their regular and fixed responsibility. With the implementation of this decision, our country's financial and economic work will surely achieve further achievements.

　　（一）论中央与地方财经工作职权的划分
    政务院于五月四日通过了《关于划分中央与地方在财政经济工作上管理职权的决定》，这一决定是正确的、适时的。在推动全国财政经济工作的进步上是有积极意义的。
    去年三月三日政务院颁发的“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”，在那时是完全必要和正确的。为什么现在又要划分财政经济上的管理职权呢？这个决定，为什么又是正确而适时的呢？这是有原因的。第一：去年是在分散管理的基础上进行统一，今年则是在统一的基础上作恰当的划分。在“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”中，政务院曾经指出：“由于财政情况的困难，收支机关的脱节，金融物价的不稳，因此，要求我们必须有进一步的统一。在公粮、税收划归中央人民政府统一支配以后，地方经费开支，比前困难的情况是可能发生的，但应该设想这种困难比之全国财政经济的管理继续不统一和金融物价大乱而来的困难，其程度和后果要小得多。因此，必须强调部分服从全体，地方服从中央的原则，宁愿忍受若干较小的困难，以便防止和避免更大的困难”。一年余以来的事实证明，当时强调统一是十分必要的，大困难是避免了，国家的财政经济工作上已经有了巨大的进步。但在地方工作上，因去年的财政经济统一，确实发生了一些小困难，或多或少地限制了地方工作的积极性。这些小困难，在保证与巩固统一的基础上，是应该恰当地予以解决的。财政三级制的实行，中央工业与地方工业的划分，已经证明是能够解决这些小困难的。第二：去年在统一国家财政经济工作当中，由于经验不足，现在看来，在某些工作上中央是管得多了一些。例如国营贸易工作，没有区别全国性比重较大的业务与地方性比重较大的业务，统由全国的各个专业公司实行垂直的领导，这样就使得某些地方性比重较大的业务，特别是在指导土产的产销上，限制了地方“因地制宜”的作用。现在有了一年多的经验，已经可以逐渐区别那些业务全国性的比重较大，那些业务地方性的比重较大，因而可以根据不同部门的业务情况，适当地划分中央与地方的管理职责。第三：属于中央集中管理但又散在各地的企业，如中央直接管理的工矿业、铁路、银行、国营贸易公司等等，对这些散在各地的企业单位的领导管理工作中，过去没有明确规定那些职权是属于中央的，那些职权是属于地方的，这就使得地方当局对在本地区的属于中央直接管理的企业难于插手过问，事实证明，像企业中的政治工作，离开了地方当局的领导，中央各部门是不可能直接管理好的。现在已有需要把散在各地的中央直接管理的企业，明确划分中央与地方在领导、管理、监督、指导、协助等等方面的职权。第四：我们国家的情况是：一个地广人众，交通尚不很发达的国家，目前仍处在人民革命大变革时期，许多事情需要由地方管理，中央财经各部门又必须集中力量于全国财政经济工作的方针、政策、计划的掌握和主要工作的领导。因此，现在提出在财政经济各部门，根据业务在管理上必须集中和应该分散的不同情况，逐渐地适当地划分中央与地方的管理职权，是正确的，适时的。
    中央与地方划分职权是在民主集中制的原则之下，“使之既利于国家统一，又利于因地制宜”（人民政协共同纲领第十六条）。因此，在财政经济工作上保证国家统一的政策、方针、计划、重要制度的贯彻实行，同时又将国营企业的管理职权中一部分适宜于地方管理的划给地方。划给地方的职权，大体分为两类：其一、把一部分国营企业或一部分财经业务全部划给地方管理，如地方工业、地方财政、地方贸易、地方交通事业等等，在这些事业上，除过保证政策、方针、重要计划、重要制度的全国统一性外，一切经营管理工作与一切政治工作，全部由地方负责。其二、散在各地的由中央财经部门直接管理的企业单位，其一切政治工作均归大行政区人民政府指定的地方当局领导，这些企业在执行上级交付的任务上，必需受地方当局的监督、指导、协助。这样划分，是适合上述原则的。为什么一切政治工作都交地方领导呢？这里必须强调指出：任何企业，实现政策、方针、计划与制度，都一定要经过经营管理工作，而经营管理工作，必须经过人来执行，这就要依靠政治工作——人员的教育、组织、动员等等。中国如此之大，我们的国营企业又散处各地，中央财经各部门对于每一个企业中的人员状况——思想情况、政治情况、工作情况、劳动态度等等，怎能够一一了解呢？事实证明：这些工作除依靠地方外，是绝没有办法办好的。而全国各大行政区各省市有成千成万的干部依靠他们为各个国营企业做政治工作，这个力量是很雄厚的。因此，国营企业中的一切政治工作，必须完全依靠地方。但是，一切政治工作必须保证政策方针的贯彻，保证生产计划的实现，保证业务计划的完成，保证重要制度的执行。因此，政治工作一定要以生产为中心，以业务为中心，必须防止政治工作与生产游离与业务游离的现象。为此，地方当局必须掌握工业、交通、商业、银行……的具体业务，而散在各地的国营企业的领导人员，必须向地方当局经常作业务和工作报告，以取得他们及时的、正确的领导与帮助。
    为什么中央财政经济各部、署、行召开的重要的专业会议所作的决定，事先要征求大行政区的意见，事后要取得大行政区的同意呢？这是因为广泛征求了下级的意见，使决定更加完满，执行起来更加顺利。这就是毛主席经常教导我们的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法的具体运用。
    这个决定，充分贯彻了领导机关必须走群众路线的精神，特别对财经部门的工作人员作了深刻的教育。人们常常容易犯的毛病是：往往把个人的力量估计过高，而相对忽视集体的力量与群众的力量；往往把个人的成绩估计过高，而相对忽视工作所以获得成绩的周围的条件与别人的作用。事实证明：一年余以来，财经部门的每一个工作人员，也如其他部门的工作人员一样，都作了很多工作，都有一定的成绩。但无论在统一财政经济工作，调整工商业，调整税收等任何一项工作上，获得成绩的主要原因是：第一、中央的正确领导，这就表现在适时的正确的提出任务，提出方针，提出办法，把群众的意见集中起来，并坚持下去。第二、中央人民政府的政令所以能够贯彻，是靠了各级党组织、政府和人民团体一致努力，与全国人民的拥护。例如收税的工作，如果没有调整工商业的工作，没有城乡交流的工作，没有调整税收的工作，没有各级地方政府调查评议的工作，没有工商团体交税竞赛的工作等等，只靠税收机关怎能获得偌大的进步呢？人民政府不同于我国历史上任何时期的政府的主要标志，就表现在这里。第三、国家的财政经济工作是很复杂的，各项工作都是密切联系着的，任务又是很艰巨的。而我们所有财政经济工作人员，在实践全国性的新民主主义的财政经济工作上，还只有短短一年多的时间，从这一点上说，我们每一个财经工作人员的工作，还只开始摸索，学习。因此，只有取得全国各级政府与全体人民的监督、指导、协助，才能减少工作中的困难，加速工作的进步。只有向群众学习，向一切有经验的人学习，才能把财政经济工作各个业务的自己存在的规律逐渐摸清楚，才能使工作大大深入一步。一年多以来，散在各地的国营企业的领导人员，大部分与地方当局的关系是好的，并且取得他们的监督、指导、协助，使工作获得应有的成绩。但是由于过去对于中央与地方对散在各地的国营企业的领导职权没有明确划分，以致还有一些国营企业的领导人员，不很明白上述道理，不服从地方当局的领导，或多或少地对地方当局闹独立性，这样对工作是十分有害的，必须加以改正。
    中央与地方具体划分财经工作管理职权的目的，是为了这样作对人民有利，对工作有利，因此，开始划分时，需要适当，划分也需要步骤，不要乱。划分之后，也并不是永远一成不变的，随着国民经济的发展，到了一定时期，如果集中的成分多一些对人民有利、对工作有利时，各级政府自然一定会拥护多集中一些的，所以这一划分绝不会影响一定时期一定事项必要的集中。这一划分会不会妨碍统一呢？不会的，因为决定中一再说明是在统一的基础上进行必要的划分，并且还提醒地方当局注意：在掌握财经工作上，必须从全面性与整体性出发。为此，必须重视以下两件事情：第一、一地一时的利益，必须服从全局和长远的利益。财政经济建设是一个复杂的长期的工作，国家工业化是一个长期建设的过程，因此，国家在建设工作的具体措施上，必须按财力、人力、资源等条件，分别先后缓急，抓重点、分步骤地进行，在这一点上，可能与某些地方的暂时利益发生矛盾。为解决这一矛盾，我们要求中央财经各部门应该把全国的财经状况经常报告给地方当局，使在地方工作的同志们能经常接触全国性的问题，同时也要求地方当局在考虑局部问题的时候，经常要从整体观点与长远观点出发。第二、必须保证全部业务方针、计划、和重要制度的执行，保证统一，贯彻统一。地方当局为贯彻这一条，就必须熟习各个企业的生产状况与业务状况，并掌握它。不然就不能正确实现监督、指导、协助的任务，也就难于保证全部业务方针、计划和重要制度的正确执行。因此，这一划分中央与地方在财政经济工作上管理职权的决定，实际上就是给地方当局加重了任务，使中央与地方分担国家财政经济工作的责任。我们相信，地方当局一定会把在政治工作上对国营企业的领导和业务上的监督、指导、协助，定为自己经常和固定的责任。随着这个决定的实行，我们国家的财政经济工作，一定会有更进一步的成就。
