Xinhua News Agency, Second Dispatch from Moscow on the 2nd: Moscow was filled with festive atmosphere on May 1st. Streets and buildings were decorated with red flags bearing May Day slogans. The Soviet national flag fluttered in the wind, and huge portraits of Lenin and Stalin were visible everywhere.

　　Red Square was solemn and majestic. The buildings opposite the reviewing stand were adorned with giant red flags and the emblems of the Soviet republics. In the distance, one could see the slogan "Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, advance to the victory of Communism!" On the Historical Museum building hung a long banner that read: "To all peoples of all countries fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism, we extend brotherly greetings!"

　　The parade began at ten o'clock in the morning. When Stalin and his comrades – the leaders of the Soviet Party and government – stepped onto the reviewing stand of the Lenin Mausoleum, they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers and salutes. On the viewing platform stood delegations from various countries who came to the Soviet Union to participate in the May Day celebrations, including representatives of the great Chinese people, representatives of the Korean people fighting for freedom and independence, as well as distinguished guests from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Canada, and Iceland.

　　At exactly ten o'clock, the Minister of the Army, Soviet Marshal Vasilevsky, inspected the troops on horseback and congratulated the soldiers and officers on the holiday. Vasilevsky then ascended the reviewing stand to deliver a speech. After the speech, a solemn artillery salute resounded across festive Moscow.

　　The parade began with students from various military academies marching past the reviewing stand. Next came the Soviet border guards – the vigilant sentinels on the borders of the Soviet Union. The air force review began simultaneously with the ground forces' march, as bomber and fighter groups flew overhead. Then came the Soviet Navy. All branches of the armed forces – cavalry, infantry, artillery, and tank troops – participated in the review. They demonstrated the excellent training of the Soviet armed forces in safeguarding the peace and security of the Soviet motherland.

　　After the military review, Red Square was silent for a moment. Then, the music soared, and a line of flag bearers entered Red Square, their bright red flags fluttering in the wind. Young Pioneers marched past the Lenin Mausoleum. Behind them were twelve thousand young men and women – representatives of Moscow sports organizations – marching in formation, holding bouquets of flowers high. The square filled with the voices of youth, cheering the great Stalin and the leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government. A young female student, holding a large bouquet of flowers, left the ranks and ascended the Lenin Mausoleum to present flowers to Stalin.

　　Row after row of parading columns entered Red Square, each holding large portraits of Lenin and Stalin decorated with flowers around the edges. Everywhere one looked, there were portraits of members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and long banners inscribed with the Bolshevik Party's May Day slogans, calling for the expansion and strengthening of the powerful front of peace advocates.

　　Raising Portraits of Chairman Mao to Salute the Chinese People

　　The people of Moscow extended warm greetings to the great Chinese people who are victoriously building a new life. Demonstrators held up portraits of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Vice-Chairman Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, and Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The demonstrators extended fraternal greetings to the working people of the people's democratic countries, who are confidently advancing along the road of socialist construction, holding high portraits of the leaders of the various people's democratic countries – Beirut, Cyrankiewicz, Gottwald, Zapotocky, Chervenkov, Damianov, Rakosi, Ronai, Doby, Gheorghiu-Dej, Groza, Bahon, Hoxha, Nishani, Choibalsan and others. The demonstrators paid tribute to the freedom-loving Korean people, who are heroically fighting to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland and against the armed intervention of foreign aggressors. They held high portraits of the Korean people's leaders, Kim Il-sung and Kim Tu-bong. Many slogans paid tribute to the German democratic forces striving for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and they held high portraits of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Grotewohl, and Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The demonstrators also held high a portrait of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as portraits of French people's leader Thorez, Italian people's leader Togliatti, American revolutionary working class leader Foster, Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party Ibárruri, and General Secretary of the British Communist Party Pollitt.

　　In songs and music, an endless stream of people poured into Red Square. Participating in the parade were famous Stakhanovite workers, advanced farmers, renowned scientists, writers, artists, and students. Factories that had been awarded the title of Stakhanovite enterprises and workers from many factories held up brightly colored charts illustrating their achievements. The marchers held up pictures depicting giant hydroelectric power stations and large canals. The working people of the Timiryazev district decorated their ranks as a blossoming apple orchard, symbolizing the victory of Michurin science. Construction workers carried models of towering buildings through Red Square, workers from the Moscow subway carried route maps of new tracks, and railway workers carried models of new locomotives, diesel locomotives, and vehicles. Hundreds of flags of various colors fluttered over the ranks of the workers of the Stalin Automobile Factory. They carried placards painted with the "ZIS" automobile brand and the factory emblem adorned with certificates awarded to the factory for its excellent performance. The unceasing music and thunderous "Hurrah" and cheers saluting the great Stalin intertwined on Red Square.

　　The people of Moscow today once again demonstrated their willingness to build communism and tirelessly strive for world peace. The demonstration ended early at three o'clock in the afternoon due to rain.
