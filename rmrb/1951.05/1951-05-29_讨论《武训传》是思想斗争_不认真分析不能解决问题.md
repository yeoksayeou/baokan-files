　　Discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" is an Ideological Struggle
    Problems Cannot Be Solved Without Careful Analysis
To the Editor:
    After the People's Daily published the editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," many groups and individuals published self-criticisms of their past erroneous praise of Wu Xun. It is commendable and worth learning from to be able to examine one's mistakes in a timely manner and improve one's thinking. However, I have some opinions on certain articles and self-criticisms about "The Life of Wu Xun," which I would like to offer for your reference.
    I believe that discussion and self-criticism should not be a repetition of the People's Daily editorial or the few critical articles about "The Life of Wu Xun" that have been published. Because that would not benefit us. We should carefully study the issue itself and conduct a serious examination of our own thinking and cognitive processes. For example: In what kind of historical era did Wu Xun live? What kind of person was Wu Xun? What kind of thought did he have? Which aspect of that historical era did this thought represent or reflect? … Then, we should connect it to ourselves. How did we initially understand that era and the character of Wu Xun? Why did we praise this character instead of disliking and criticizing him? What kind of ideological connection do we have with Wu Xun that makes us resonate with him? Why do we now feel that our past understanding was wrong? How was it wrong?
    I believe that once an incorrect understanding has arisen, formed, and dominated our behavior, it cannot easily disappear or be replaced by another understanding without repeated in-depth research, analysis, and struggle. Because this is ideological transformation, an ideological struggle; if the new understanding does not gradually take root and form in us, becoming a dominant force, the old, wrong understanding will not automatically disappear. The formation of an incorrect ideological understanding has a certain historical origin. Our discussion and self-criticism are not only aimed at the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the character of Wu Xun, but more importantly at our own thinking, in order to dig out the root of our incorrect ideological understanding and eliminate it.
    Therefore, if after reading the editorial or a few articles, one believes that our thinking has fundamentally changed, then one has understood thinking and transforming thinking too simply. This saves us trouble, but it is useless. We have all read "On Practice" more than once, but in dealing with the specific issue of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the specific character of Wu Xun, it proves that we have not truly understood and are not able to truly apply "On Practice." Then, after reading the editorial and a few articles, to immediately think that our ideological understanding is fundamentally different from yesterday, is this really believable?
    I think our past shortcoming lies here: we often did not seriously think, research, and analyze a specific problem, a specific event, a specific character. This is something we should pay attention to in the process of discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" and in the future.

### 讨论《武训传》是思想斗争  不认真分析不能解决问题

　　讨论《武训传》是思想斗争
    不认真分析不能解决问题编辑同志：
    人民日报发表社论《应该重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》后，很多团体和个人发表了对过去错误地歌颂武训的自我检讨。能及时检讨自己的错误，使自己思想提高了一步，是值得赞扬和学习的。但是，对某些关于武训传的文章、检讨，我有一点意见，愿意提出来供大家参考。
    我认为，讨论和检讨，不是把人民日报的社论或发表过的几篇批判《武训传》的文章重复一遍。因为那样，对于我们是没有益处的。我们应该把问题本身仔细地研究清楚，把我们自己的思想和认识过程认真地进行一次检查。例如：武训究竟处在一个怎么样的历史时代？武训究竟是一个什么样的人物？他究竟具有怎么样一种思想？这种思想代表了或反映了那个历史时代的那一个侧面？……然后，再联系到我们自己。我们开始是怎样认识那个时代和武训这个人物的？我们为什么会歌颂这个人物而不是厌恶和批判这个人物？我们自己和武训有着怎样一种思想上的联系，因而使得我们对他发生共鸣？此刻，我们为什么又觉得自己过去的认识不对？是怎样不对？
    我认为：一种错误的认识既然产生了，形成了，而且支配了我们的行为；那就不可能不经过反复的深入的研究、分析、斗争，就轻易消失掉，轻易换上一种别的认识。因为这是一种思想改造，思想斗争；新的认识如果不是逐渐在我们身上生根、形成，成为一种主导的力量，旧的错的认识是不会自动消失的。形成一种不正确的思想认识，是有一定历史根源的。我们讨论和检讨，不仅是针对着《武训传》这部影片和武训这个人物，更重要的是针对着我们自己的思想，是为了要挖出形成我们不正确的思想认识的根源来，消灭它。
    因此，如果读了社论或几篇文章，就认为我们的思想已经根本改变了，这就把思想和改造思想理解得太简单了。这对于我们是省事的，但是是无益的。我们谁都读过不止一遍《实践论》了，但是在对待《武训传》这个具体问题、武训这个具体人物时，却证明了我们并没有真正通晓和真能运用《实践论》。那么，读过社论和几篇文章，就立刻以为我们的思想认识根本上和昨天不同了，这难道是确实可信的吗？
    我以为我们过去的缺点就在这里：对待一个具体问题，一个具体事件，一个具体人物，常常没有认真地思索、研究、分析。这是值得我们在讨论《武训传》的过程中以及今后注意的。
