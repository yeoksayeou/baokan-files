　　Firmly Support the "New Five Punishments"
    Chen Yuan

    After listening to Mayor Peng's and Minister Luo's reports on the handling of counter-revolutionary cases this time, I believe that classifying them into "Death Penalty, Death Penalty with Reprieve, Life Imprisonment, Fixed-Term Imprisonment, and Release" is very reasonable and appropriate. I think this can be called the "New Five Punishments" of New Democracy.

    Among them, the suspended death sentence is a new addition this time, which is "sentenced to death, suspended for two years, forced labor, to observe the effect." During the suspension period, they are not just allowed to eat the people's millet for free. If they perform well, they can be changed to life imprisonment. This fully demonstrates that the people and the People's Government are broad-minded and do their best. As long as there is a glimmer of hope for them to reform, the people will give them a chance to start anew. This is the most meticulous and scientific handling method, a dialectical and pragmatic handling method, a combination of suppression and leniency, and beneficial to the people. I firmly support the "New Five Punishments" created by the People's Government.

　　坚决拥护“新五刑”
    陈垣
    我听了彭市长和罗部长对这次处理反革命案件的报告，分“死刑、死刑缓期、无期徒刑、有期徒刑、释放”五种，是非常合理而且恰当的，我认为这可以叫做新民主主义的“新五刑”。
    其中缓刑一种，是这次新增的，就是“判处死刑，缓期二年，强迫劳动，以观后效。”在缓刑期间，并不是叫他们白吃人民小米，如果表现得好，可改为无期徒刑，这充分说明人民和人民政府是宽大为怀，仁至义尽的，只要他有一线可以改造的希望，人民就给与他自新的机会。这是最精细最科学的处理办法，是辩证的实事求是的处理办法，是镇压与宽大相结合的，是对人民有利益的。我坚决拥护人民政府创造的“新五刑”。
