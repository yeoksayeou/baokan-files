　　Hubei's Nanxin River and Neijing River to be Dredged
    Reply from the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government to Reader Huang Xiangbing
    To Comrade Huang Xiangbing, forwarded by the People's Daily Reader's Letters Group:

    Your letter of February 21st has been received. The relevant local authorities have already taken notice of the situation in the inner rivers of Jingmen and seven other counties in Hubei, where certain fishing installations are causing slow water flow and increased water levels, resulting in waterlogging. As far as we know, the drainage system between Changhu Lake, Bailuhu Lake, and even Honghu Lake, with the Nanxin River and Neijing River on the north and south sides, is mostly silted up. The majority of people in Jiangling, Jianli, and Mianyang counties have been suffering from waterlogging for more than a day. Under such circumstances, many residents can only rely on fishing for a living. In order to alleviate the suffering caused by waterlogging to the people, the Hubei Provincial People's Government has begun planning to dredge this drainage system.

　　湖北南新河与内荆河将疏浚
    中央人民政府水利部函复读者黄祥冰人民日报读者来信组转黄祥冰同志：
    二月二十一日来信收到。湖北荆门等八县内河因某些捕鱼设置而使水流迟缓，水位增高，造成渍水为害的情况，当地有关机关已经予以注意。就我们所知，长湖、白鹭湖以至洪湖间的排水系统，南北二流的南新河与内荆河中间多有淤塞，江陵、监利沔阳三县大部人民，苦于渍水为害已非一日。在那种情况下，有很多居民只能靠捕鱼为业。为了解除渍水给人民带来的痛苦，湖北省人民政府已着手计划疏通这一排水系统。
