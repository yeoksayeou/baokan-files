    Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Mechanical Technology Research Association Holds Demonstration to Promote High-Speed Cutting Method
    After the Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory successfully experimented with high-speed cutting, the Mechanical Technology Research Association of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions held a public demonstration at the factory on May 20th. Nearly 270 workers from nearly 70 units, including machinery, electrical engineering, steelmaking, and textile machinery, in the city visited the demonstration. The high-speed cutting demonstration included four items. The first demonstration was cutting the eccentric shaft and crankshaft, important parts of the internal combustion engine. Using the old method, it took 90 minutes to cut, but now it only takes 6 minutes and 42 seconds to complete. The third item was milling flat plates on a vertical milling machine. Normally, it takes two hours to mill a flat plate, but with high-speed cutting, it only takes 28 minutes and 30 seconds. Finally, Xing Deyu, a worker from the Automobile Parts Factory, demonstrated cutting piston ring tools with various high-speed cutting methods, which only took 45 minutes to complete, a job that previously required 360 minutes. After the demonstration, a forum was held. Li Tianmin, director of the Mechanical Technology Research Association, called on everyone to break with conservative thinking, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to promote the high-speed cutting method. Labor models, technicians, and workers attending the meeting unanimously expressed that they would make their best efforts to learn the high-speed cutting method, improve tools where possible, and fully utilize the potential efficiency of machines.
            Beijing Suburban Farmers Actively Rush to Plant After Rain
    On the evening of the 23rd and the 24th of this month, there was widespread rainfall in the suburbs of Beijing, with a rainfall of about four fingers. This rain was of great help to the sowing of unseeded cultivated land, the irrigation of wheat, and the elimination of red spider mites, so the farmers' morale was very high. After the rain stopped on the 25th, many farmers in various districts rushed to plant peanuts, corn, and other crops.
    The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued an emergency instruction to all districts on the 24th, instructing them to lead farmers to seize the opportunity to rush to plant after the rain, and to conduct timely seedling inspection and replanting to ensure the victorious completion of the spring sowing task.

    天津总工会机械技术研究会举办表演会推广高速切削法
    天津市汽车制配厂试验高速切削成功后，天津市总工会技术研究总会机械技术研究会于五月二十日在该厂举行公开表演会。参观表演的有该市机器、电工、炼钢、纺织机械等近七十个单位的职工二百七十余人。高速切削表演共有四项。首先表演的是切削内燃机的重要零件偏心轴和曲轴。用旧的方式，需要九十分钟才可切完，现在只要六分四十二秒就完成了。第三项是立式铣床铣平板，平常须铣二小时的平板，用高速切削只二十八分三十秒就完成了。最后，由汽车制配厂工人邢德禹表演用各种高速切削法切削活塞环工具，只要四十五分钟就完成了从前需三百六十分钟的活。表演后，又举行了座谈会。机械技术研究会主任李天民号召大家打破保守思想，学习苏联先进经验，努力推广高速切削法。参加会议的劳动模范、技术人员、工人一致表示将以最大努力，学习高速切削法，在可能条件下，改良刀具，充分发挥机器潜在效能。
            北京郊区农民雨后积极抢种
    本月二十三日晚及二十四日，北京郊区普遍落雨，雨量四指左右，这场雨对尚未下种的耕地的播种、麦子的灌浆及红蜘蛛虫害的消灭都有很大帮助，因此农民情绪非常高涨。二十五日雨停后，各区已有许多农民抢种花生、玉茭等作物。
    北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会已于二十四日紧急指示各区，领导农民突击雨后抢种，并及时进行查苗、补苗工作，以保证春季播种任务的胜利完成。
