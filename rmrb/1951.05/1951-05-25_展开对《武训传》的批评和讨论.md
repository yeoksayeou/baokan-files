Unfold Criticism and Discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Yu Ling, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Cultural Bureau
    The film "The Life of Wu Xun," after more than a year of production, has been released in many major cities across the country, starting from Shanghai. Yet, we, the film workers of Shanghai, have failed to recognize that "The Life of Wu Xun" is a film that incorrectly portrays historical figures and historical traditions, a film that is ideologically and politically flawed. On the contrary, in the early stages of the film's release, numerous newspapers and magazines published reviews that were entirely praising the film or praising Wu Xun himself.
    Around April and May, issues 37 and 38 of "Wenyi Bao" successively published Comrade Jia Ji's "Wu Xun, Not Worthy of Emulation," Comrade Jiang Hua's "Suggestions for the Education Circle to Discuss 'The Life of Wu Xun'," a reprint of Mr. Lu Xun's "Difficult Questions to Answer," as well as Comrade Yang Er's "A Tentative Discussion on Whether Mr. Tao Xingzhi's Praise of the 'Spirit of Wu Xun' Has Any Positive Effect" and Comrade Deng Youmei's "Some Materials on Wu Xun." On May 16th, when the "People's Daily" reprinted these articles, the editor pointed out in an editor's note that "The Life of Wu Xun" is: "a film that praises Wu Xun, a supporter of the feudal rule of the late Qing Dynasty, and slanders peasant revolutionary struggles, slanders Chinese history, and slanders the Chinese nation..." Only then did we become more clearly aware of the principled nature of the erroneous thinking exposed in this film and in the past reviews of this film.
    This situation is serious.
    This is a major issue.
    First, for such a film that praises Wu Xun, a supporter of the feudal rule of the late Qing Dynasty, and slanders peasant revolutionary struggles, slanders Chinese history, and slanders the Chinese nation, we Shanghai film workers—including the comrades responsible for leading Shanghai's film departments—neither detected the problem during its more than a year-long production process, nor were we able to promptly discover its errors after its release.
    Even more seriously, to this day, we Shanghai film workers have not been able to conduct large-scale, widespread discussions, openly launch criticism, understand the issues, and excavate the roots, in order to draw lessons from the production and screening of "The Life of Wu Xun," raise awareness, and correct mistakes.
    The errors manifested in the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and in most of the initial reviews of "The Life of Wu Xun" are very serious, such as portraying Wu Xun, who fully represents the slavish thinking of supporting feudal rule, as a typical figure of hardworking and courageous working people; portraying Wu Xun, who compromised, succumbed, and served feudal rule, as a fighter, as someone who served the people. The Chinese nation is rich in fighting spirit, and Chinese peasants have continuously waged struggles against feudal rule for thousands of years. During the same period and in the same region as Wu Xun, there were vigorous peasant revolutions—such as the Nien Rebellion—while Wu Xun used kowtowing and begging to raise money to establish free schools, in order to educate the peasant children who had no money to study to become obedient subjects of feudal rule. Wu Xun and the "Spirit of Wu Xun" should be severely criticized, yet we praised him. For such serious errors, we Shanghai film workers were completely unaware, and even after "Wenyi Bao" began to point out these errors, we still did not launch large-scale, public criticism! This shows that our political theory and ideological level are still very low, our class viewpoint and historical viewpoint, as well as our study of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought and direction, are still stuck in superficial understanding. Therefore, when encountering practical problems, our concepts are exposed as being very muddled. For many years, the Chinese film market has been filled with low-grade, poisonous American films, spreading harmful and bad influences on the people. We need to produce new people's films to meet the needs of the vast audience in New China. Therefore, we cannot expect to jump to a high degree of integration of ideological and artistic quality in one step; but we must never blur our class stand because of this. Film is a powerful weapon for educating the broad masses, and the influence on the broad audience is the most direct and relatively profound. Therefore, it also requires our film art workers to treat our work with a highly serious and responsible work attitude. The erroneous praise and long-term silence of Shanghai film workers regarding "The Life of Wu Xun" also proves that our mass viewpoint is insufficient—lacking a serious and responsible spirit towards the broad masses.
    Serious, meticulous, and profound criticism of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun" from ideological and artistic perspectives has already begun. We have ample reason and absolute necessity to attach importance to this issue and actively and courageously participate in this principled ideological struggle. Therefore, we Shanghai film workers should universally conduct discussions and criticisms of "The Life of Wu Xun" and Wu Xun, promptly convene symposiums to study and explore this issue, and thereby launch a widespread movement. Only through universal, mass-based, and extensive discussions and criticisms can we be educated, gain experience, and conscientiously improve ourselves ideologically and politically. Only then will we not repeat serious errors like "The Life of Wu Xun" in the future, and will we be able to produce excellent new patriotic films that conform to Chinese historical figures and historical traditions, and that conform to the real demands of the Chinese people.

　　展开对《武训传》的批评和讨论
    上海市人民政府文化局副局长  于伶
    《武训传》这部影片，经过一年多的摄制过程，拍成之后，从上海开始，已经在国内许多大城市公映过了。而我们上海的电影工作者，一直不曾发现《武训传》是一部对历史人物与历史传统作了不正确表现的、在思想上政治上错误的影片。相反地，当这样一部影片公映的初期，许多报纸和杂志上，发表了全部是赞扬这部影片或者是赞扬武训本人的评论。
    到了四、五月间，《文艺报》三十七和三十八期上先后发表了贾霁同志的《不足为训的武训》，江华同志的《建议教育界讨论〈武训传〉》，转载鲁迅先生的《难答的问题》，以及杨耳同志的《试谈陶行知先生表扬“武训精神”有无积极作用》和邓友梅同志的《关于武训的一些材料》；五月十六日《人民日报》转载这些文章时，编者在按语中指出《武训传》是：“歌颂清朝末年的封建统治拥护者武训而污蔑农民革命斗争、污蔑中国历史、污蔑中国民族的电影……”。到这时，我们才比较清醒地意识到这部影片里，及对这部影片的过去评论里面所暴露的错误思想之原则性。
    这种情况是严重的。
    这是一个重大的问题。
    首先，对于这样一部歌颂清朝末年的封建统治拥护者武训而污蔑农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史、污蔑中国民族的影片，我们上海电影工作者——包括负责上海电影部门领导工作的同志在内——既未能在它的一年多之久的拍摄过程中发现问题，又未能在它的公映之后，及时发现出它的错误来。
    而更其严重的，直到今天，我们上海电影工作者还没有能够大规模地、普遍地进行讨论、公开地展开批评、认识问题、发掘根源，以达到从《武训传》这部电影的制作与放映的问题上得出教训，提高认识，纠正错误。
    《武训传》影片和初期的大部分对《武训传》的评介文章中所表现的错误是非常严重的，如把十足代表拥护封建统治的奴才思想的武训说成是勤劳、勇敢的劳动人民的典型人物，把妥协、屈膝投降为封建统治服务的武训说成是斗争的、是为人民服务的；中国民族是富于斗争精神的，中国农民几千年来不断地进行反抗封建统治的斗争，就在武训的同一时期，同一地区就有轰轰烈烈的农民革命——如捻党的革命运动，而武训却用磕头跪求来募钱兴办义学，以“三纲五常”教育无钱读书的农民子弟成为封建统治的顺民。武训和“武训精神”，是应该严厉批判的，而我们却表扬了他。对于这样严重的错误，我们上海电影工作者竟毫无所觉，甚至在文艺报开始指出这些错误以后，仍然没有大规模地公开地展开批评！这说明我们的政治理论和思想水平还是很低，我们的阶级观点和历史观点以及对毛主席文艺思想和文艺方向的学习还停留在皮毛浮面的理解，因此在接触到实际问题时，就暴露出我们的观念是非常糊涂的。中国的电影市场多年来充满美国的低级的有毒的影片，传播着有害人民的恶劣影响。我们需要制作出新的人民电影来，以供给新中国广大观众的需要，因此，我们不能要求一脚就跨到思想性与艺术性高度结合的地步；但决不能因此而模糊了阶级立场。电影是教育广大群众的有力武器，广大观众受到的影响最直接也比较深刻，因此也更需要我们电影艺术工作者以高度严肃负责的工作态度来对待我们的工作。我们上海电影工作者对《武训传》错误的赞扬和长期缄默，也证明我们的群众观点不够——缺乏对广大群众严肃负责的精神。
    对于武训和《武训传》这部电影，从思想上和艺术上进行严肃的仔细深刻的批评，已经开始了。我们有十足的理由与绝对的必要来重视这一个问题，并积极与勇敢地参加到这一场原则性的思想斗争中去。因此我们上海电影工作者，应当普遍地进行对于《武训传》和武训的讨论与批判，迅速召开对这一问题的研究与探讨的座谈会，并由此展开广泛的运动。只有经过普遍的群众性的广泛的讨论与批判，才能从中受到教育，获得经验，从思想上，从政治上认真提高一步。今后才不致于重复发生《武训传》这样的严重错误，才能制作出优秀的新爱国主义的影片，符合中国历史人物与历史传统的，符合中国人民现实要求的影片来。
