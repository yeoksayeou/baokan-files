            Local People's Governments Should Change Street Names Formerly Named After Bandit Chiang
    In the past, the reactionary Kuomintang government used the name of Bandit Chiang as street names in various cities. After liberation, some cities still have not changed these street names. According to reports from our branches, places such as Lu'an County in northern Anhui, Jiashan County and Lanxi County in Zhejiang, still have "Zhongzheng Street"; Longyou County and Yunhe County in Zhejiang still have "Zhongzheng Road"; Fenghua County in Zhejiang still has "Zhongzheng Garden". We hope that the governments in the aforementioned areas will quickly change these street names named after the public enemy of the Chinese people, so as not to insult the people's streets.

            Newly Dug Canal Irrigates Newly Distributed Land: Luoshan Xiazhai Village Peasants are overjoyed
    Xiazhai Village is a key demonstration village for land reform in Se Port District, Luoshan County, Henan Province. It concluded its land reform work on April 20th of this year. In less than half a month, the village bought two new waterwheels, one cow, seventy-five plows and twenty-one harrows. Everyone is very enthusiastic about production. As soon as the call for the establishment of mutual aid teams was made, more than half of the newly emancipated peasants joined. For many years, many peasants had been looking forward to irrigated land. While the land reform was underway, some members of the peasant association clamored to build water conservancy facilities after the land was distributed. Recently, under the leadership of village cadres, the peasants of the whole village dug a three-mile-long canal in two days. This new canal, like a long snake, coiled on the fields of the new masters and has now begun to irrigate. The peasants, looking at the new water flowing from the new canal, irrigating the newly distributed fields, couldn't help singing a self-composed emancipation tune: "The poor have been given land! No worry about food and clothing! Let's work hard! Strive for a bumper year..."

            Why Haven't I Received the Magazine a Year After Subscribing? Xinhua Bookstore Shijiazhuang Branch Should Investigate and Reply
    On March 16th of last year, we subscribed to the "New China Women" magazine, issues 9 to 14, from the North China Xinhua Bookstore Shijiazhuang Branch. The order number is 04020. But until today, a year and two months have passed, and we have not received a single magazine.
    We have been to the Shijiazhuang Branch to inquire about this dozens of times. Every time they always said, "Let's send an official letter to the head office to ask." But the magazine has never been sent. We wanted to change our subscription to "New China Women" to another magazine, but they would not allow it. The Xinhua Bookstore Shijiazhuang Branch's extremely irresponsible attitude towards its work and the masses is worth serious examination.

            Grain Stolen by Bad Elements Without Them Even Knowing: Staff of the Liulihe Office of the Tongxian Branch of the China Grain Company are Too Careless
    The staff of the Liulihe Office of the Tongxian Branch of the China Grain Company are ideologically negligent and their management system is not strict. They didn't even know that the grain had been stolen by bad elements. On May 18th, the Liulihe and Matou police stations uncovered five thieves (landlords, puppet soldiers, and other bad elements), including Lu Zhenrong, who stole four bags of corn from the office. On the same day, personnel from the Liulihe police station went to the Liulihe Office of the China Grain Company to understand the situation. According to the thieves, the grain was stolen a month ago. But no one in the office knew about it. This shows that they lack a certain management system and that the staff are ideologically negligent. We hope they will examine and correct this.

            Some Village Cadres in Yiyang Have Serious Coercive Command Styles in Leading Production
    Some village cadres in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, have shown a coercive command style in leading production. For example: (1) Plowing: Some cadres organized all the cattle in the township and used them in a unified way, setting a time limit for plowing. (2) Rice Seedlings: In order to facilitate insect removal in the rice paddies, the government called for planting "standard rice paddies" (leaving a foot of space for every four feet wide of seedlings). Some peasants could not accept this method for a while, and many township and village cadres trampled on the seedlings in the rice paddies, making the peasants very scared. When they saw working comrades, they would say, "I have broken the law, my rice seedlings are not planted in the standard way." Some said, "Is it okay to pull them apart later when the seedlings have grown deeper?" (3) Leasing Mobilized Land: After the land reform, some villages left a portion of public land, which was of poor quality. The masses were unwilling to lease it, and as a result, some were distributed based on labor, stipulating that each person should plant twelve mu of land. If you only planted ten mu of land, you would have to lease two mu of public land, regardless of how far away you lived or whether it was convenient. (4) Forcing the Establishment of Mutual Aid Teams: Some villages turned peasant association groups into mutual aid teams, forcing people to engage in mutual aid. I think the above coercive command style should be corrected.
            Zeng Luzhong
     Editor's Note: The leading cadres of Yiyang County should immediately conduct an inspection and correction based on this reflection.

　　来信摘要
            原以蒋匪为名的街道名称各地人民政府应予改换
    过去国民党反动政府在各城市里曾以蒋匪的名字作为街道名称。解放后仍有些城市里没有把这些街道名称改掉。据我们接到各地分支行报告材料中，发现皖北六安县、浙江嘉善县、兰溪县等地，仍然有“中正街”；浙江龙游县、云和县等地，仍然有“中正路”；浙江奉化县仍然有“中正花园”。希望上述各地政府，迅速改换这种以中国人民公敌为名的街道名称，以免污辱人民的街道。

            新渠灌溉着新分的土地罗山夏寨村农民喜洋洋
    夏寨村是河南省罗山县涩港区土地改革的重点试范村。今年四月二十日结束了土地改革工作。没过半月，村里就新买了两架水车，一条牛，七十五张犁和二十一个钉耙。大家生产劲头很大，说声成立互助组，半数以上的新翻身农民都参加了。很多农民多年来都想望着水浇田，在土地改革正在进行的时候，一些农会会员就吵着分了地以后修水利。最近，在村干部领导下，全村农民在两天之内就挖成三里长的一条水渠，这条新渠，像长蛇一样弯曲地盘伏在新主人的田地上，现已开始灌溉。农民看着新渠流出的新水，灌溉着新分的田地，情不自禁地唱出自编的翻身小调：“穷人分了田啊！不愁无吃穿啊！咱们要加油干啊！争取丰收年呀……”

            订了杂志为什么一年也收不到？新华书店石家庄分店应检查答复
    去年三月十六日我们向华北新华书店石家庄分店订阅《新中国妇女》杂志九期至十四期一份。订单号码是零四零二零。但直到今天，已经一年又二个月了，我们还没有收到一本杂志。
    我们为此曾到石家庄分店去询问了十数趟。每次他们总是说：“我们去封公函到总店问问吧。”但杂志始终没寄来。我们想把《新中国妇女》换订别的杂志，他们也不允许。新华书店石家庄分店所表现的这种对工作对群众极不负责任的态度，值得深刻检讨。

            被坏分子偷了粮食还不知道  中国粮食公司通县分公司琉璃河办事处工作人员思想太麻痹
    中国粮食公司通县分公司琉璃河办事处的工作人员思想麻痹，保管制度不严，粮食被坏分子偷去也不知道。五月十八日，琉璃河、马头两地公安派出所查获窃犯卢振荣等五人（系地主、伪军等坏分子）在该办事处偷去的四麻包玉米，当日，琉璃河公安派出所人员前往中国粮食公司琉璃河办事处了解情况。据窃犯供称，粮食是一个月以前偷去的。但该办事处竟没有一个人知道这件事。这说明他们缺乏一定的保管制度，工作人员思想麻痹。希望他们检查纠正。

            益阳某些乡村干部领导生产有严重的强迫命令作风
    湖南益阳县某些乡村干部在领导生产中，表现了强迫命令的作风。例如：（一）翻田：有些干部把全乡的牛统统组织起来，统一支配使用，限时翻田。（二）秧田：为了便于在秧田除虫，政府号召种“合式秧田”，（每种四尺宽的秧即空一尺。）有些农民一时不能接受这种办法，很多乡、村干部便到秧田里乱踩秧苗，弄得农民很害怕。见到工作同志即说：“我犯了法，我的秧田种得不合式。”有些说：“秧长深了以后再扯开来好吧！”（三）机动田招佃：有些村在土地改革后留下一部分公田，质量都较差，群众不愿佃种，结果有些按劳动力分种，规定每人种田十二亩，如你只种了田十亩的话，你就得佃种二亩公田，不管你住的远近和是否方便。（四）强迫成立互助组，有的村把农会小组改为互助组，强迫搞互助：以上强迫命令的作风，我觉得是应该改正的。
            曾路中
     编者按：益阳县的领导干部应根据这个反映，立即进行检查、纠正。
