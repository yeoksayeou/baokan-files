　　Attach Importance to Opera Reform Work
　　Today, this newspaper publishes the directive of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on opera reform work. This directive will have a significant impact on the advancement of opera reform work nationwide.
　　Chairman Mao said in "On New Democracy": "China's long feudal society created a brilliant ancient culture. Therefore, clearing up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence." China's old opera is an important part of the brilliant culture created by the Chinese people in a long feudal society. Because it is the creation of the people, it inevitably reflects the character of the Chinese people—their diligence, courage, wisdom, and kindness; their various just struggles to get rid of oppression and enslavement; and their desire for freedom, happiness, and a reasonable life. Therefore, it has democracy. This is its essence. On the other hand, because it is a product of feudal society, it cannot but be influenced by feudal ideas and is often distorted by feudal rulers for the purpose of paralyzing and poisoning the people. Therefore, it has feudalism. This is its dross. Today's opera reform work is to do a scientific clearing work, remove the dross, absorb the essence, and promote the essence. In this way, we will "weed through the old to bring forth the new" and transform the national old opera into a national new opera. This is an extremely important historical task in the entire cultural and artistic work.
　　China's opera heritage is extremely rich and has close ties with the broad masses of the people, influencing the spiritual lives of millions of people every day. Therefore, we must not take a laissez-faire attitude towards the old opera, but must adopt a policy of active reform. We are against both delaying reform and crude reform. Since reform involves the issue of treating the national cultural heritage, we must cherish and respect our national cultural heritage, distinguish between good and bad, and make choices, and we must not adopt an attitude of total negation. Since reform involves the lives of hundreds of thousands of opera performers, we must recognize that performers are part of the working people. Although many of them have been infected with the habits of the old society, in terms of their actual social status, they are mental workers who were insulted and discriminated against in the old society. We must cherish and respect them, unite and educate them. They are able and willing to make progress, and we must not take a contemptuous and exclusive attitude towards them. Since reform involves the hobbies of millions of people, the people have reason to love their own national traditional art, and once their political awareness is raised, they immediately have the ability to distinguish, despise the old feudal content and welcome the new content of the opera. We must respect the people's hobbies, tastes, and appreciation habits, and must not arbitrarily obliterate them. Therefore, opera reform work must rely on the education and cooperation of the broad masses of performers, rely on free competition in which new opera gradually replaces old opera, in other words, rely on the method of ideological struggle, and generally should not rely on administrative orders and bans. This is why we must take a cautious attitude on the issue of banning operas.
　　The central link in opera reform is to rely on and cooperate with the broad masses of performers to jointly examine, revise, and write scripts. Old operas must be re-evaluated and reviewed with a new spirit of patriotism and correct historical and artistic viewpoints. Most of the old operas are based on historical stories and folk tales; folk tales contain some excellent myths that express the people's struggle against oppressors and their pursuit of an ideal life with rich imagination and beautiful images. “The Tale of the White Snake,” “Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,” “The Heavenly River Match,” “Sun Wukong Havocs in Heaven,” and other such excellent legends and myths should be distinguished from scripts that promote superstition and should be preserved and cherished. All good repertoires in old opera should be affirmed as national traditional repertoires, and all positive factors in them should continue to be developed. Of course, there are many places in old opera that reverse or distort historical truth and insult the working people, which is to insult their own nation. These places must be resolutely revised. Attention must also be paid to the following when revising: Historical events and figures should be evaluated according to the historical conditions at the time, and one should not force the ancients to have the thoughts of modern people or do the things of modern people; nor should one make inappropriate comparisons between historical events and the revolutionary struggles of the people today. If so, it is a violation of history and incorrect.
　　Along with revising the script, all barbaric, terrifying, obscene, slavish, and bad performances on the stage must be resolutely eliminated. This kind of performance is insulting to one's own nation and violates patriotism.
　　Because China has a long history and a vast territory, the types of opera are extremely rich and diverse. There are about a hundred kinds of opera in the country, large and small. Various local operas have the characteristics of local languages, music, and customs. The creations of people from all over the country for thousands of years have greatly enriched China's national drama heritage. Such a large number of local operas, folk minor operas, and Quyi should be universally explored, adopted, transformed, and developed. Local operas, especially folk minor operas, have relatively simple and lively forms, are easy to transform and develop, are easy to reflect modern life, and are easy to be accepted by the masses. Special attention should be paid to them. Opera workers should make full use of these forms to create scripts that express the lives and struggles of modern people. Over the past year or so, Peking Opera and other local operas have made many reform efforts and achieved results. Experience has proved that any opera that dares to innovate, dares to create, and dares to progress with the progress of the audience will be welcomed by the audience, and its own artistic life will also be newly developed. In terms of artistic form, our policy is not to specially support one form and oppose another, but as the Government Administration Council's instruction pointed out: "Encourage the free competition of various opera forms and promote the 'blooming of a hundred flowers' in opera art." This is precisely to encourage the free competition of various opera forms in terms of innovation and creation. However, opera reform work must also be focused. The instruction stipulates: "The work of improving opera should focus on the opera genre that has the greatest impact on the local masses as the main object of reform and development." This is completely in line with the needs of the people and the laws of the development of dramatic art. The "blooming of a hundred flowers" of various opera forms across the country will enable us to see the magnificent future of new opera art and the colorful prospects of our national art garden.
　　Over the past year or so, opera performers across the country have improved their political awareness through learning and actively participated in opera reform and various social and political activities. The social status of performers is completely different from what it was before liberation. They have received the respect of the state and the people. Their responsibility in the cause of entertaining and educating the people is even greater, and they must further improve themselves in terms of politics, culture, and professional skills. The competent authorities for culture and education at all levels should attach importance to the work of opera reform and earnestly lead it politically and ideologically so that the Central People's Government's instructions on opera reform work are implemented one by one. Under the leadership of the People's Government, new literary and art workers and opera performers should unite and strive together for the "blooming of a hundred flowers" and "weeding through the old to bring forth the new" in opera art!

### 重视戏曲改革工作

专栏：社论

　　重视戏曲改革工作
    今天本报发表了中央人民政府政务院关于戏曲改革工作的指示。这个指示，对全国戏曲改革工作的推进，必将发生重大的作用。
    毛主席在“新民主主义论”中说：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。因此清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件。”中国的旧戏曲，正是中国人民在长期封建社会中所创造的灿烂文化的重要部分之一。由于它是人民的创造，就必然表现出中国人民勤劳、勇敢、智慧、善良的性格，他们为要摆脱被压迫被奴役的状态所进行的各式各样的正义斗争，以及他们对自由、幸福、合理的生活的渴望，因而它就有了民主性。这就是它的精华部分。另一方面又由于它是封建社会的产物，不能不蒙受封建思想的影响，不能不常常地被封建统治者加以各种歪曲，用作麻醉毒害人民的工具，因而它就有了封建性。这就是它的糟粕部分。今天的戏曲改革工作，就是要作一番科学的清理工作，剔除糟粕，吸收精华，并把精华部分发扬光大，这样就会“推陈出新”，就会把民族旧戏曲变成为民族新戏曲，这是整个文化艺术工作中的一项极其重要的历史性的任务。
    我国戏曲遗产极为丰富，和广大人民有密切的联系，每天影响着千千万万人民的精神生活。因此对于旧的戏曲，就不能采取放任自流的态度，而必须采取积极改革的方针。我们既反对拖延不改，也反对粗暴的改革。改革既然牵涉到对待民族文化遗产的问题，那末对自己民族文化遗产必须爱护、尊重，分别好坏加以取舍，而不能采取一概否定的态度。改革既然牵涉到数十万戏曲艺人的生活，必须认识艺人是劳动人民的一部分，他们中间虽有不少人沾染了旧社会的习气，但就他们的实际社会地位来说，他们是在旧社会中被侮辱被歧视的精神劳动者，必须爱护、尊重他们，团结与教育他们，他们是能够而且愿意进步的，不能对他们采取轻视和排斥的态度。改革既然牵涉到千百万人民的爱好，人民有理由喜爱自己民族传统的艺术，而且他们的政治觉悟一经提高，他们就立刻具有辨别的能力，鄙弃封建旧内容而欢迎新内容的戏曲。对人民的爱好、趣味和欣赏习惯，必须尊重，不能任意加以抹煞。因此，戏曲改革工作，必须依靠对广大艺人的教育与合作，依靠以新的戏曲逐渐代替旧戏曲的自由竞赛，换句话说，就是依靠思想斗争的方法，一般地不应依靠行政命令与禁演的方法。这就是为什么在禁戏问题上我们要采取慎重态度的理由。
    戏曲改革的中心环节是依靠与广大艺人合作，共同审定修改与编写剧本。对旧有戏曲必须以新的爱国主义精神和正确的历史的与艺术的观点重新加以评价和审定。旧有戏曲大部分取材于历史故事和民间传说；在民间传说中，包含有一部分优秀的神话，它们以丰富的想象和美丽的形象表现了人民对压迫者的反抗斗争与对于理想生活的追求。《白蛇传》《梁山伯祝英台》《天河配》《孙悟空大闹天宫》等，就是这一类优秀的传说与神话，应当与提倡迷信的剧本区别开来，加以保存与珍视。对旧有戏曲中一切好的剧目均应作为民族传统剧目加以肯定，并继续发挥其中一切积极的因素。当然旧戏曲有许多地方颠倒或歪曲了历史的真实，侮辱了劳动人民，也就是侮辱了自己的民族，这些地方必须坚决地加以修改。在修改时又必须注意：对历史事件和人物应根据当时的历史条件予以估价，既不应强使古人有今人的思想，做今人的事；更不应将历史事迹与今天人民的革命斗争作不适当的比拟。如果那样，就是违反历史的，不正确的。
    与修改剧本同时，对舞台形象上一切野蛮恐怖的，猥亵的，奴化的，恶劣的表演，也必须坚决地加以革除。这种表演是侮辱自己民族的、违反爱国主义的。
    由于中国历史悠久，国土广大，戏曲种类极为丰富多样，全国大小剧种约在百种左右，各种地方戏都带有各地方的语言、音乐和风俗的特点，千百年来全国各地人民的创造，大大丰富了中国民族的戏剧遗产。对如此众多的地方戏、民间小戏和曲艺，应普遍地加以发掘、采用、改造与发展。地方戏尤其是民间小戏，形式比较简单活泼，容易改造发展，容易反映现代生活，也容易为群众接受，应特别加以重视。戏曲工作者，应充分地利用这些形式来创造表现现代人民的生活和斗争的剧本。一年多来京剧和其它各种地方戏都作了许多改革的努力，是有成绩的。经验证明，凡是勇于革新，勇于创造，勇于随着观众的进步而进步的剧种，一定受到观众的欢迎，其本身的艺术生命，也得到新的发展。在艺术形式上，我们的方针，不是特别扶植一种形式而反对另一种形式，而是如政务院指示所指出的：“鼓励各种戏曲形式的自由竞赛，促成戏曲艺术的‘百花齐放’。”这正是鼓励各种戏曲形式在革新与创造方面的自由竞赛。但戏曲改革工作又必须是有重点的。指示规定：“戏曲改进工作应以对当地群众影响最大的剧种为主要改革和发展对象。”这是完全符合人民群众的需要与戏剧艺术发展的规律的。全国多种多样的戏曲形式“百花齐放”的结果，将使我们看到新歌剧艺术的壮丽的前途，看到我们民族艺术大花园中万紫千红的远景。
    一年多以来，全国各地戏曲艺人经过学习，提高了政治觉悟，积极地参加了戏曲改革事业及各种社会政治活动。艺人的社会地位与解放以前完全不同了。他们受到了国家和人民的尊重。他们在娱乐与教育人民的事业上所负的责任也就更大了，必须在政治、文化、业务各方面更进一步提高自己。各级文教主管机关应重视戏曲改革的工作，并在政治上思想上切实地加以领导，使中央人民政府政务院关于戏曲改革工作的指示，一一付诸实施。在人民政府领导之下，新文艺工作者和戏曲艺人应团结起来，为戏曲艺术的“百花齐放”、“推陈出新”而共同奋斗！
