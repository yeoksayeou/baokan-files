　　Production Competition Charts
    ——A Form of Propaganda in Factories
    In the anti-US and aid-Korea movement, factories in Northeast China created a new form of propaganda and mobilization that combined current affairs education with production tasks, which greatly stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm and achieved great results.
    The most typical example is the "Beat the War Criminals" production performance comparison chart in a factory in Dalian. On the top of the chart was a US aggressor's plane carrying war criminals Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and others; below were six "anti-aircraft guns" representing the six major groups of the factory, aiming at the plane. Each time a group completed the repair of a vehicle, a "shell" would rise one grid on the gun's muzzle. The number of grids was equal to the number of vehicles planned to be repaired for the entire month. Therefore, the group that completed the work plan first would be able to successfully hit the US aggressor's plane. When the workers saw the American plane in the picture invading our country's airspace, they all said with gritted teeth: Let's work harder and shoot it down! The workers were enthusiastic and worked hard, adding fuel to production, and every night they carried lanterns to see how far their group's shells were from the aggressor's plane. Finally, they saw on the chart that Dong Xiangling's group's shell hit the plane—completing the task ahead of schedule.
    After the "Beat the War Criminals" chart proved effective, other production units competed to imitate it, applying it to all aspects of production competition. For example, the blacksmith branch of the Dalian Railway Factory created "New Production Record Competition Charts," "Rationalization Proposal Competition Charts," and "Waste Material Utilization Competition Charts." The forms also underwent some changes, such as cannons firing at warships carrying war criminals, and workers holding ropes to capture war criminals. These charts played a tremendous role in boosting production. In November of last year, the factory put forward a total of twenty-three rationalization proposals; created twenty-one new records; and increased the utilization of waste materials by three times compared to usual.
    Recently, some postal and telecommunications enterprises in Shanghai have also adopted similar production competition charts, with very good results.

### 生产竞赛图表——工厂中的一种宣传形式

　　生产竞赛图表
    ——工厂中的一种宣传形式
    东北各地工厂，在抗美援朝运动中，创造了把时事教育与生产任务相结合的新的宣传鼓动形式，激发了工人的生产热情，收到很大成绩。
    最典型的例子是大连某工厂的“打战犯”生产成绩比较表。上面画着一架载有战争罪犯蒋介石、李承晚等的美国侵略者的飞机；下面有六门“高射炮”，代表该厂六个大组，瞄准着这架飞机。那组修完一辆车，“炮弹”就在那组的炮口上上升一格。格数和全月计划应修的车辆数相等。因此那组先完成工作计划，那组就能胜利地打中这架美国侵略者的飞机。当工友们看到画上的美国飞机侵入我国上空时，大家都切齿忿恨地说：加劲干呀，把它打下来！工友们热情奋发，加油生产，每天晚上都提着灯笼，看自己组的炮弹离侵略者的飞机还有多少距离。最后，终于在图表上看到了董香苓组的炮弹打中了飞机——提前完成了任务。
    “打战犯”图表收到成效后，其他生产单位都竞相仿效，用到生产竞赛的各个方面去。如大连铁路工厂打铁分厂制出了“生产新纪录比赛表”，“合理化建议比赛表”，“利用废料比赛表”等。在形式上也有些变化，如大炮打载着战犯的军舰，工人手拿绳索捉战犯等。这些图表，在生产上都起了非常巨大的鼓动作用。该厂去年十一月份共提出二十三件合理化建议；创造出二十一项新纪录；利用废料较平常增加三倍。
    最近上海有些邮电企业单位也采用了类似的生产竞赛图表，效果都很好。
