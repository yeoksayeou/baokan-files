	(II) Strengthening Leadership in Mass Current Affairs Learning

	Following the widespread propaganda of April and the May Day demonstration, the political consciousness of people from all walks of life in various regions has significantly improved. They are keenly concerned about national affairs and universally demand to learn about current events. We must attach great importance to such ideological progress and changes among the people, and actively guide them to further promote the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

	The high level of enthusiasm for learning among the masses is unprecedented. In the thousands of patriotic pacts they have made, people from all walks of life in various regions have expressed their determination to study current affairs diligently. Many workers, farmers, industrialists, businessmen, and urban residents have spontaneously established newspaper reading groups and current affairs study classes or groups, or have requested to join spare-time schools, adult literacy classes, and evening schools for the people. In the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, workers and staff participating in newspaper reading groups account for more than 52 percent of the plant's total employees. In Licheng Maicang Village and Jincheng Chengguan District, Shanxi, people from all walks of life organized more than 50 newspaper reading groups in April. In Zhaotong County, Yunnan, 80 percent of the 50,000 people in the urban area have recently joined newspaper reading groups. In Cangzhen, Hebei, few in the industrial and commercial sectors were willing to study politics in the past, and they subscribed to newspapers only to see market prices. However, by the end of April, 22 of the town's 32 industries had established 24 current affairs study groups and nine spare-time schools, with more than 540 people participating in the study. The number of newspapers subscribed to by industrial and commercial households in the town has increased from 42 to 110, and the number of current affairs manuals purchased has increased from 25 to more than 380. In the third police station of the Beicheng District of Luzhou City, southern Sichuan, more than 400 residents have signed up for literacy classes. All of this shows that the broad masses not only have a desire to learn but have also taken active and spontaneous action. However, if they do not receive timely and correct leadership from relevant departments, the masses' enthusiasm for learning may gradually wane as it becomes uncontrolled. Therefore, strengthening leadership in the mass current affairs learning movement is a matter of urgency. Propaganda and education departments and mass organizations in various regions should first organize all those who are willing to learn through various organizational systems, help them establish regular current affairs study classes, current affairs study groups, and newspaper reading groups, or absorb them into various spare-time schools. They should also appoint dedicated personnel to be responsible for leadership and formulate regular study systems suitable to the needs of the masses and the specific conditions of the locality, so as not to allow the mass learning movement to fall into an unguided state of drift. Particular attention should be paid to the current affairs learning of ordinary residents, because their occupations are very complex and difficult to organize. If they are not properly guided according to the specific circumstances, they often cannot persist in their studies.

	Secondly, in various learning organizations, attention should be paid to explaining domestic and international events in light of the ideological situation of the masses, and to carrying out patriotic education in a relatively systematic way. In cultural learning organizations, a certain amount of time should also be allocated to current affairs learning, and the integration of cultural and political lessons should be studied and resolved.

	Thirdly, after the broad masses have participated in learning, they now feel that there is a lack of teaching materials. Therefore, all localities should mobilize news and publishing organs to supply a large number of current affairs and political reading materials that are correct in content and simple and easy to understand in form, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses. This is a necessary condition for realizing the political leadership of the mass learning movement.

   （二）加强对群众时事学习的领导
    经过四月份的普遍宣传和五一大示威以后，各地各界人民的政治觉悟已显著提高，他们热切地关心着国家大事，普遍要求学习时事。我们必须十分重视人民群众中这样一个思想进步与变化，积极加以领导，借此推动抗美援朝运动更进一步发展。
    目前广大群众学习热情的高涨是从来没有过的。各地各界人民在他们所订立的千万个爱国公约中，纷纷表示要努力学习时事，许多工人、农民、工商业家和城市居民自动建立了读报组和时事学习班或小组，或者要求加入业余学校、成人识字班和民众夜校等。北京石景山钢铁厂参加读报组的工人和职员已占该厂职工总数的百分之五十二以上。山西黎城麦仓村和晋城城关区各界人民在四月间已组织了五十多个读报组。云南昭通县城区的五万人口中，到最近已有百分之八十参加了读报组。河北沧镇工商业界过去愿意学习政治的人很少，订报纸也只是为了看行情；但到四月底全镇三十二个行业中，已有二十二个行业建立了二十四个时事学习小组和九个业余学校，参加学习的有五百四十多人。该镇工商业户原来只订了四十二份报纸，现已增加到一百一十份，购买的时事手册由二十五本增加到三百八十多本。川南泸州市北城区第三派出所报名参加识字班的居民达四百多人。这一切都说明广大群众不但有了学习要求，而且已积极地自发地行动起来了。但是如果不能及时地得到有关部门的正确领导，群众的这种学习的热情是可能因陷于自流，而逐渐消沉的。因此，加强对群众时事学习的领导已是迫不容缓的事。各地区的宣传教育部门和群众团体应首先通过各种不同的组织系统，把所有愿意学习的人组织起来，帮助他们建立经常性的时事学习班、时事学习小组、读报组，或者吸收他们参加各种业余学校，并应指定专人负责领导，定出适合于群众要求和当地具体情况的经常性的学习制度，不要使群众的学习运动陷于无人领导的自流状态。其中对一般居民的时事学习尤应特别注意，因为他们的职业很复杂，很难组织，如果不很好地按照具体情况加以领导，往往不能坚持学习。
    其次，在各种学习组织中，应随时注意针对群众的思想情况，讲解国内外大事，并比较有系统地进行爱国主义教育。在文化学习的组织中，还应规定一定时间从事时事学习，并研究解决文化课与政治课结合进行的问题。
    第三、广大群众参加学习之后，目前已感到教材缺乏，因此各地应动员新闻出版机关供给大量内容正确、形式通俗浅显的时事、政治读物，来满足广大群众的需要。这是实现对群众学习运动的政治领导的必要条件。
