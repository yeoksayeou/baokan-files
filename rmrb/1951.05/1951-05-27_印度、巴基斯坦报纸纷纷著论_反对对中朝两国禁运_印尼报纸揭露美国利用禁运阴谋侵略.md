Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The US imperialists' illegal manipulation of the United Nations General Assembly to declare an embargo against our country has aroused widespread dissatisfaction and opposition from Indian and Pakistani newspapers.

Indian newspapers pointed out that this action by the United States is a step towards expanding the war. The *Indian Express* said on the 17th: "The direct impact of this resolution is that... those who once hoped to limit the scope of the war will be hampered by it." The *Times of India* said on the 16th: "The dead (referring to the ousted) MacArthur is more powerful than the living (referring to those in office) MacArthur. The US government... is following his lead, and the United Nations' strategy is now almost indistinguishable from what he advocated." The *Indian News Chronicle* said: "Despite the dismissal of General MacArthur, the US Far East policy remains the same."

The Indian *National Herald* pointed out that the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly was illegal. The newspaper said: "The United Nations General Assembly obviously cannot handle the embargo issue, because according to the United Nations Charter, the implementation of measures is entirely within the purview of the Security Council." *The Tribune* also pointed out that this was "usurping the powers that should belong to the Security Council."

Several Southeast Asian newspapers exposed the United States' attempt to use the embargo to launch an economic offensive against Southeast Asian countries. The Indonesian *Freedom Daily* said: The intention of the embargo is to make Southeast Asian countries completely dependent on the United States and to depress the prices of local raw materials. And "after becoming the sole buyer, the United States will have the power to drag Southeast Asian countries into its bloc and force them to abandon independent policies." Indian and Pakistani newspapers were particularly indignant at the United States' attempt to use the embargo to strike at trade between India, Pakistan, and China. The Indian *National Herald* believes that even an "effective embargo will not affect China." However, the embargo may prevent famine-stricken India from obtaining rice from China. The *Times of India* said on the 9th: "In any case, the United States, which has been extremely stingy even in supplying India with food on loan, cannot expect New Delhi to enthusiastically consider severing economic ties with a country that has shown such concern for our needs." *Vigor Daily* also said on the 10th that if "China is blockaded, then India will be affected. India has arranged to exchange goods for Chinese grain. Countries that impose a blockade on China may prevent any trading vessels between China and India. Can India tolerate this situation?" Pakistani newspapers believe that the embargo will cause the country's cotton to lose its market in China. *Imroze* said on the 9th: "Some time ago, our cotton prices were able to remain fairly stable because China purchased our cotton... If Pakistan benefits more from trade with China—experience has proven that this is indeed the case—then under no circumstances should this boycott plan be supported."

### 印度、巴基斯坦报纸纷纷著论  反对对中朝两国禁运  印尼报纸揭露美国利用禁运阴谋侵略

　　印度、巴基斯坦报纸纷纷著论
    反对对中朝两国禁运
    印尼报纸揭露美国利用禁运阴谋侵略
    【新华社二十六日讯】美帝国主义非法操纵联合国大会宣布对我国实行禁运的行动，引起了印度、巴基斯坦报纸广泛的不满和反对。
    印度报纸指出，美国这一行动是扩大战争的步骤。《印度快报》十七日说：“这一决议的直接影响是，……那些曾经希望限制战争范围的人们，会因之束手。”《印度时报》十六日说：“死的（指下台的）麦克阿瑟比活的（指在台上的）麦克阿瑟更有力量。美国政府……唯他的马首是瞻，现在联合国的策略和他所主张的……差不多没有什么不同。”《印度新闻纪事报》说：“尽管麦克阿瑟将军被免职，美国的远东政策依然如故。”
    印度《国民先驱报》指出联合国大会通过的决议是非法的。该报说：“联合国大会显然不能处理禁运问题，因为依照联合国宪章，措施的实施完全在安全理事会的权限之内。”《论坛报》也指出，这是“僭取了理应归安全理事会所有的职权”。
    若干东南亚国家的报纸揭发美国企图利用禁运来对东南亚各国发动经济进攻。印尼《自由报》说：禁运的用意是使东南亚国家完全仰赖于美国，并压低当地原料的价格。而“美国在成了独一无二的买主之后，就有力量来把东南亚国家卷入它的集团，迫使它们放弃独立的政策。”印度和巴基斯坦报纸对美国企图利用禁运来打击印、巴两国与中国之间的贸易，尤其表示愤慨。印度《国民先驱报》认为，即使是“有效的禁运都不会使中国受到影响”。但是，禁运却可能使饥荒中的印度得不到中国的大米。《印度时报》九日说：“无论如何，甚至在以借贷的方式供应印度粮食的问题上都表现得极其吝啬的美国，总不能期望新德里会热心考虑与一个曾经表现得那样关怀我们的需要的国家断绝经济上的联系。”《活力报》十日也说，如果“实行封锁中国的话，那末印度就会受到影响。印度已经安排好以实物交换中国的粮食。对中国实施封锁的各国可能阻止中国与印度之间的任何贸易船只。印度能够容忍这种情况吗？”巴基斯坦报纸认为，禁运要使该国所产的棉花失去在中国的市场。《伊姆罗兹》报九日说：“若干时候以前，由于中国购买我们的棉花，我们的棉价得以保持相当平稳。……如果由于与中国贸易，巴基斯坦得到更大的好处——经验证明实际上是这样的，那末，在任何情况下，绝不应支持这种抵制计划。”
