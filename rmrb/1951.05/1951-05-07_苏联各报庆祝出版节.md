    真理报社论写道：苏维埃报纸是全世界最自由、最信实的报纸，是具有最崇高的理想和高度原则性并密切联系群众的报纸。它忠诚为苏联人民的和平建设性劳动及其保卫世界和平的斗争服务。它的力量在于共产党的领导，在于有系统地加强与群众的联系。真理报指出：苏维埃报纸已经赢得了苏联人民及全世界进步人类的热烈爱护。各人民民主国家及各国工人阶级的报纸都学习着布尔什维克报纸的经验和战斗传统。
    消息报著文称：一切国家的进步报纸都认为苏联报纸是为和平事业进行始终不渝的斗争的模范。它无情地撕破战争挑拨者的假面具，揭露帝国主义国家统治集团的外交政策的侵略性质。消息报指出：布尔什维克报纸是属于人民和反映人民的切身利益的。它的光荣的职责就是支持人民所创造出来的先进事物；把生产战线上的开路先锋的经验介绍给劳动人民，使社会主义竞赛的火焰燃烧得更加炽烈；并且经常以列宁——斯大林思想的精神教育劳动人民。
