Chairman Mao's Trade Policy Saved Us
——On the Development of Trade Work in Ethnic Minority Areas of Northwest and Southwest China
        Zheng Zhong
    "Chairman Mao, like the sun, warmly shines on people,
    Making cattle and sheep strong and healthy.
    Ma Bufang, like ice and snow, melts away in the sun,
    Ultimately meeting a bad end!"
    This poem was sung by the Golok people, who had taken refuge in the Bayan Har Mountains after suffering cruel persecution at the hands of the Ma Bufang bandit gang. They had been cut off from the inland for thirty-two years, eating only *jiaoma* (a wild plant with underground stems) and drinking cow blood, living an inhuman existence. Not long ago, a group of forty-three of them gathered, trekking over mountains and rivers, carrying over 9,000 *jin* of wool, and arrived for the first time in liberated Huangyuan, Qinghai, where they sold their goods at a reasonable price set by the People's Government and exchanged them for grain. They were overjoyed and could not help but sing from the bottom of their hearts.
    In fact, such examples are countless in the ethnic minority areas of Northwest and Southwest China after liberation. "Chairman Mao has come, and the price of wool has gone up!" "Chairman Mao is our Great Living Buddha!" This saying has spread throughout the grasslands and mountains of ethnic minority areas. They praise and say: "Chairman Mao's trade policy has saved our lives!"
    The Northwest and Southwest regions are vast, with herds of cattle and horses, and extremely rich resources above and below ground. In the ethnic minority areas of Northwest China, the income from animal husbandry often accounts for more than 90 percent of the total annual income of farmers and herdsmen. The ethnic minority areas of Southwest China have many precious local products, such as safflower from Tibet, medicinal materials from western Sichuan, musk from western Kang, and raw lacquer from Guizhou, which are sold throughout the country and are famous at home and abroad. However, under the bloody rule of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs, heavy taxes were imposed, bandits were everywhere, trade routes were cut off, and countless local products could not be sold and became waste. Farmers in Ningxia fed their wolfberries to pigs; farmers in Gansu used *danggui* as firewood; tea farmers in the Ya'an Prefecture of western Kang watched their tea trees grow old on empty mountains, and their tea gardens become desolate. The local farmers and herdsmen passed down a saying in those painful days: "Goods and wealth are abandoned on the ground, and hunger and cold bring tears to both eyes!"
    After the successive liberation of the Northwest and Southwest regions, the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government were gradually implemented in the ethnic minority areas. Trade cadres assigned to these areas carried forward the glorious tradition of hard work and perseverance, implemented the policy of free domestic trade, and did their best to help with the economic construction of the ethnic minority areas. The Yunnan Provincial Trade Company adopted the method of taking turns attending market fairs to purchase large quantities of agricultural and livestock products from farmers and herdsmen and supply industrial products. Because the trade company purchased local hemp cloth, the ninety households of the Lisu people in Zhawo Village, Yuanmou County, exchanged it for 3,500 pieces of local cloth, and in addition to wearing it, each household also stored one or two pieces of local cloth. The state-owned trade organs in Dushan Prefecture, Guizhou, established 250 trade groups, going deep into mountain villages and market towns to proactively deliver daily necessities such as tea, salt, oil, and cloth to the ethnic minority areas. The Southwest Salt Administration adopted methods such as carrying salt down to the countryside, setting up retail stores, and entrusting state-owned trade, cooperatives, and private merchants to sell salt on commission, freeing the Miao and Yao compatriots who had been unable to eat salt for years from the pain of bland food. The Xikang Provincial Trade Company regarded the connection of Kang-Tibet trade as its primary task. From June to December last year, it transported 300,000 packages of tea (16 *jin* per package on a level scale) to the Tibetan area and exchanged for and transported out 150 tons of local products such as wool, musk, and borax from the Tibetan area. As a result, the Kang-Tibet trade, which had been paralyzed for a long time, was reactivated, and the situation of isolation between urban and rural areas and the interruption of goods was initially changed, and a new situation of smooth flow of goods and the best use of materials emerged. Therefore, Chairman Mao's trade policy has been widely and warmly welcomed by ethnic minorities. Many people in ethnic minority areas have automatically taken up arms to protect the lives and property of trade groups. They say that this is "exchanging hearts for hearts, and different ethnic compatriots are as close as brothers and sisters!"
    Chairman Mao's trade policy has been widely spread in ethnic minority areas. Ethnic minority merchants are also actively and continuously transporting local products. In December last year, Kazakh compatriots in Gansu went to Dunhuang for the first time to open up trade relations, and subsequent merchants have followed one after another. More than 1,400 Tibetans in Yushu area, Qinghai, carrying more than 20,000 heads of yak and *pianniu*, traveled for more than four months and arrived in Huangyuan one after another between January and February this year to trade. As trade hubs with ethnic minorities, cities such as Xining, Huangyuan, Guide, Lanzhou, Luzhou, Kunming, Chongqing, and Guiyang are bustling with trade groups wearing various ethnic costumes. Warehouses and inns are in short supply. The "Mongolian and Tibetan Stores" in Dingyuan Camp, Ningxia, have increased from 27 to 115; the *louhu* (basket carriers) in Ankang have grown from 30 to 830. All merchants and stores that deal in local and special products are now thriving.
    Now, ethnic minorities have begun to get rid of their poverty and misery and are moving towards a prosperous and happy life. This is powerfully demonstrated by the changes in the exchange ratio between industrial products and agricultural and livestock products before and after liberation. The price of local products such as wool and cowhide in the pastoral areas of Qinghai has generally increased by more than eight times compared with before liberation; in Xinjiang, one *jin* of spring wool (sheep wool) could be exchanged for one *jin* of flour before liberation, but now it can be exchanged for four *jin*. In western Kang, each *dan* of wool could be exchanged for three packages of tea during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now it has been raised to eight packages. Last year, the Northwest Fur Company collected more than 24 million *jin* of wool, equivalent to 1 million bolts of 40-yard cloth, which is the first major income for the ethnic groups in the pastoral areas of Northwest China in history. State-owned trade organs in Qinghai Province vigorously purchased local products, solving the clothing problem for 16 percent of the province's population; in A'shan area, Xinjiang, each person bought an average of more than 15 *chi* of local cloth in the autumn and winter seasons last year, and the increase in purchasing power is very amazing. In Huangyuan, Xining, Guide and other places in Qinghai, and Linxia, Xiahe, Hexi, Jiuquan, Zhuoni, and Taozhou in Gansu, the sales of cloth, rice, flour, and food have increased by more than two times compared with before, and the vast majority of these items were bought by ethnic minorities. In the countryside of Qinghai, everywhere is a new atmosphere of "building new houses, changing into new clothes, buying livestock, and adding agricultural implements." The tragic life of "no oil and salt for meals, no cotton clothes in winter, and no livestock for farming" will never return. Lama Ban'erdi of the Zhuoni Diebu Tribe said: "The Living Buddhas in the temple gave us nothing, Chairman Mao tells us to have food and drink, he is our real Living Buddha!" Songla Cairang, a Tibetan in Tar Monastery, Huangzhong, wrote a poem called "Ode to Chairman Mao," which forcefully expresses the life and feelings of ethnic minorities after liberation. The translation of this poem into Chinese is:
    The pine trees on the mountain are green,
    The river flows swiftly,
    The sun's rays are warm,
    Chairman Mao's kindness is closer than parents.

　　毛主席的贸易政策救了我们
    ——记西北、西南少数民族地区贸易工作的开展
        郑重
    “毛主席，象太阳，暖烘烘地照在人身上，
    牛羊也健壮。
    马步芳，象冰雪，太阳出来融化光，
    终久没有好下场！”
    这首诗，是因遭受马匪步芳残酷虐杀而避居到巴颜喀喇山上的果洛族同胞唱出来的。他们已经和内地隔绝了三十二年，每天吃角麻（一种有地下茎的野草），喝牛血，过着非人的生活。不久以前，他们集合了四十三人，爬山涉水，运了九千多斤羊毛，首次到达解放后的青海湟源，按照人民政府规定的合理价格出售了自己的货物，换回粮食。他们惊喜若狂，情不自禁地发出了衷心的歌唱。
    其实这种例子，在解放后的西北、西南少数民族聚居地区是不胜枚举的。“毛主席来了，羊毛就涨价！”“毛主席是我们的大活佛！”这种说法，已经传遍了少数民族地区的草原和山野。他们称赞说：“毛主席的贸易政策挽救了我们的生命！”
    西北区和西南区，幅员辽阔，牛马成群，地上地下的资源极为丰富。西北兄弟民族地区，农牧民畜牧业的收入，常占全年总收入的百分之九十以上。西南兄弟民族地区有许多名贵的土产，如西藏的红花，川西的药材，西康的麝香，贵州的生漆等，都行销全国，驰名中外。但在蒋、马匪帮的血腥统治下，捐税重重，土匪遍地，商旅断绝，无数土产无法外销，变成废物。宁夏农民以枸杞喂猪；甘肃农民以当归烧火；西康雅安专区的茶农，坐看树老山空，茶园荒芜。当地农牧民在痛苦的日子里流传着一句话，即：“货财委地无人收，饥寒交迫泪双流”！
    西北、西南区相继解放后，中国共产党和人民政府的民族政策，逐步推行到兄弟民族地区。分派到这些地区的贸易干部们，发扬了吃苦耐劳的光荣传统，执行了国内贸易自由的政策，尽力帮助兄弟民族地区的经济建设。云南省贸易公司曾采用轮流赶集的办法，大量收购农牧民土产与供应工业品。该省元谋县杂窝村的九十户傈僳人民，因贸易公司收购土产麻布，全村换回土布三千五百件，除穿用外，每家还存土布一两件。贵州独山专区国营贸易机关成立二百五十个贸易小组，深入山村和集镇，把茶、盐、油、布等日用必需品，主动地送到兄弟民族地区。西南盐务局，采用背盐下乡，设立零销店，并委托国营贸易、合作社、私商代销等方式，使经年累月吃不到盐的苗、徭同胞，解除了淡食痛苦。西康省贸易公司，把沟通康藏贸易当成首要工作，自去年六月至十二月，运往藏区茶叶三十万包（每包十六斤天平秤），换回和运出藏区的羊毛、麝香、硼砂等土产一百五十吨。结果，使长期陷于瘫痪状态的康藏贸易重新活跃起来，初步改变了城乡隔绝、物资断流的局面，出现了货畅其流、物尽其用的新情况。因此，毛主席的贸易政策，受到兄弟民族广泛的热烈的欢迎。许多兄弟民族地区人民都自动拿起武器，保护贸易小组的生命与财产。他们说，这是“人心换人心，异族同胞手足亲！”
    毛主席的贸易政策已广泛地传遍少数民族地区。兄弟民族的商旅也主动的、源源不绝的运出了当地的土产。去年十二月，甘肃的哈萨克族同胞，首次到敦煌打通贸易关系，后继的商旅现已接踵而来。青海玉树区有一千四百多藏胞，携毛牛、犏牛两万多头，历时四个多月，于今年一、二月间先后到达湟源进行贸易。作为与兄弟民族贸易枢纽的西宁、湟源、贵德、兰州、泸州、昆明、重庆、贵阳等城市，穿着各色各样民族服装的贸易行伙，纷至沓来，货仓客栈出现供不应求状态。宁夏定远营的“蒙藏行”，由二十七户增加到一百一十五户；安康的篓户从三十家发展到八百三十家。凡是经营土产、特产的行商与行栈，现在都已繁荣起来。
    现在，兄弟民族已开始摆脱了穷困、悲惨的境遇，走向富裕康乐的生活。从解放前后工业品和农、牧产品交换比价的变化中，有力地证明了这一点。青海牧区羊毛、牛皮等土产价格，一般较解放前提高八倍多；新疆一斤春毛（羊毛）解放前换面粉一斤，现在可换四斤。西康每担羊毛抗战期间换茶叶三包，现已提到八包。西北区皮毛公司去年共收羊毛两千四百多万斤，相当于四十码布一百万匹，这是西北牧区民族有史以来第一笔大收入。青海省国营贸易机关大力收购土产，解决了全省百分之十六的人口的穿衣问题；新疆阿山区去年秋冬两季，每人平均买土布十五尺以上，购买力的增长是很惊人的。青海的湟源、西宁、贵德等地，甘肃的临夏、夏河、河西、酒泉、卓尼、洮州等地，布匹米面食粮等销售量，比以前增加了两倍多，这些物品的绝大部分为兄弟民族买去。青海农村中到处是“盖新房、换新衣、买牲口，添农具”的新气象。“吃饭没油盐，冬天没棉衣，耕地没有牲口”的悲惨生活，将永远地一去不复返了。卓尼叠部落喇嘛班尔地说：“寺院的活佛什么也没有给我们，毛主席叫我们有吃有喝，才是我们真正的活佛！”湟中塔尔寺藏民松拉才郎，作了一首诗名叫《歌颂毛主席》，刚健有力地道出了解放以后少数兄弟民族的生活和感想。这首诗译成汉文是：
    山上的松树青青的哩，
    河里的流水滚滚的哩，
    太阳的光芒暖暖的哩，
    毛主席的恩情比父母还亲哩。
