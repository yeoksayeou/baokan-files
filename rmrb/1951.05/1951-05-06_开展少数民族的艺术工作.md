Developing the Art Work of Ethnic Minorities
    Yan Li

In the past year, the art work of ethnic minorities has seen significant development. Since liberation, ethnic minorities in various regions have been using their own unique forms of songs and dances to praise their new lives, to sing the praises of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, fully demonstrating their high level of political consciousness and fraternal friendship. In Xinjiang Province, the professional troupes of the Uyghur and Kazakh ethnic groups have even begun creating and performing new operas. During last year's National Day celebrations, the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe, the Yanbian Cultural Troupe, the Xinjiang Cultural Troupe, and the cultural troupes of various ethnic groups from the Southwest performed in Beijing more than twenty times, receiving a warm welcome from the audience. These performances fully demonstrated the richness of China's diverse ethnic art treasures, and also showcased the creative talents of the people of various ethnic groups in the arts.

Last year, the Ministry of Culture organized cultural work teams and Peking opera teams to travel with the Central Delegation to various ethnic minority areas in the Southwest and Northwest for touring performances. This has played a role in promoting the exchange of ethnic arts and helping ethnic minorities develop their artistic work. At the same time, many military and local cultural troupes have also been conducting performances among ethnic minorities. These performances have had a good effect on educating the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups and strengthening ethnic friendship and unity.

The key to developing ethnic minority arts lies in truly respecting their artistic traditions and the people's preferences. In the past year, the collection, organization, research, and study of ethnic minority arts have been emphasized by literary and art workers in various regions. The Northwest has sent specialized teams to Xinjiang and Qinghai to study the dances and songs of various ethnic groups. They recorded and preserved the twelve classical suites of Uyghur music from Xinjiang, which were on the verge of being lost. The collection and research work in Inner Mongolia and the Southwest has also yielded many results. Many Han Chinese literary and art workers have been educated in the process of engaging with the excellent art of various ethnic minorities, and have begun to establish a correct understanding of these ethnic arts.

When carrying out the ethnic minority arts movement, it is necessary to correctly grasp the guiding principle of "new democratic content and national form." On the one hand, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of various ethnic minorities to despise their own traditional artistic forms. On the other hand, it is necessary to prevent self-isolation and the failure to absorb the excellent traditions of other ethnic arts. In developing the national form, it is necessary to prevent mechanically interpreting the national form from the surface (such as only regarding clothing as a characteristic of the national form), rather than starting from the ethnic group's lifestyle, language characteristics, and the artistic traditions of the ethnic group itself, so as to enable the national form to move towards a higher stage of development.

Facts have proven that the people of ethnic minorities in various regions are very fond of new art. However, most ethnic groups do not have professional artists, let alone art work cadres. Therefore, in addition to sending some literary and art workers to ethnic minority areas to help with their work, it is more important to adopt various methods to train art cadres from the ethnic groups themselves, so as to further develop the ethnic minority art movement. Regarding this aspect of the work, the Northwest Art Institute has established a Department of Ethnic Minority Arts to train artistic talents from ethnic minorities in the Northwest. The Southwest region has absorbed a large number of working people with artistic talents from ethnic minorities to form cultural troupes, engaging in work and training cadres at the same time. Inner Mongolia has adopted the method of convening folk artist representative conferences and training courses to help Inner Mongolian folk artists improve their political awareness, strengthen their artistic learning, and promote and help them participate in new art activities. We hope that the major art academies and art groups across the country will pay attention to the work of studying ethnic minority art and training ethnic minority art cadres.

　　开展少数民族的艺术工作
    严立
    一年来少数民族的艺术工作有了很大的开展。各地区少数民族在解放后用自己民族形式的歌和舞，歌颂新的生活，歌颂毛主席与共产党，充分表现了高度的政治觉悟与兄弟友情。新疆省维吾尔族及哈萨克族的职业剧团并已开始新歌剧的创作与演出。去年国庆节，内蒙文工团、延边文工团、新疆文工团、西南各民族文工团在北京演出二十余次，受到观众很大的欢迎。这些演出的节目充分说明了中国各民族艺术宝藏的丰富，也显示了各民族人民在艺术上的创造才能。
    去年，中央文化部组织了文工队及京剧队随中央访问团分赴西南及西北各少数民族地区进行巡回演出。这对于促进民族艺术的交流，帮助各少数民族开展文艺工作是有作用的。同时，许多部队及地方文工团也在少数民族中进行演出活动。这些演出对于教育各民族广大人民，加强民族友谊与团结，也都起了很好的效果。
    发展少数民族文艺的重要关键是在于真正尊重他们的艺术传统与人民的爱好。一年来，对于少数民族艺术的搜集、整理、研究与学习等工作，已为各地文艺工作者所重视。西北曾派专门小组远赴新疆青海学习各民族舞蹈及歌曲。他们把濒于失传的新疆维族的古典乐曲十二大套，录音保存。内蒙古及西南地区的搜集与研究工作，也有不少收获。许多汉族文艺工作者在与各少数民族的优秀艺术接近的过程中，受到了教育，开始对这些民族艺术树立起正确的看法。
    在开展少数民族的文艺运动时，正确地把握“新民主主义的内容与民族的形式”这一指导原则是必要的。一方面必须防止各少数民族轻视本民族传统的文艺形式的偏向，另一方面又必须防止故步自封、不求吸取其他民族文艺优良传统的偏向。而在发展民族形式这一问题上，又必须防止机械地从表面上解释民族形式（如仅以服装为民族形式的特征），而不从民族生活习惯、语言文字特征、以及本民族的文艺传统等等出发，这样才能使民族形式走向更高阶段的发展。
    事实证明各地少数民族人民对新文艺都是十分喜爱的。但是大多数的民族没有职业艺人，更没有艺术工作干部。因此除了必须派遣一些文艺工作者去少数民族地区帮助工作外，更重要的是采取各种方式培养各民族自己的艺术干部，这样才能使少数民族的文艺运动得到进一步的发展。关于这一方面的工作，西北艺术学院已设立了少数民族艺术系，以培养西北少数民族的艺术人才。西南区更从少数民族中吸收大批具有艺术才能的劳动人民组织了文工团，一面进行工作，一面培养干部。内蒙则采取民间艺人代表会议及训练班的方式，帮助内蒙的民间艺人提高政治认识，加强艺术学习，推动与帮助他们参加新文艺活动。我们希望，全国各重要艺术学院与艺术团体都来注意研究少数民族艺术与培养少数民族艺术干部的工作。
