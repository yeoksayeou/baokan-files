　　Our Family Covenant
　　Female Worker Ye Lixing
　　There are four people in my family: besides myself, there's my husband Fan Yongtian, and his third younger sister Fan Zhongping, and sixth younger sister Fan Aiping. My husband, Fan Yongtian, drives a pedicab. His average monthly income is around 400,000 yuan. My monthly income is 280,000 yuan, and my younger sister-in-law, Fan Zhongping, earns 350,000 yuan per month, totaling 1,030,000 yuan. The income is more than enough to cover expenses, but because everyone has different personalities and there is no plan for handling household affairs, my husband and I often quarrel, causing the family finances to often be in deficit.
　　My husband is very loyal to his friends and willing to help fellow workers. Sometimes he gives clothes to friends to start small businesses. On April 9th, when there was only 10,000 yuan left in the house, he gave the money to a friend without hesitation when they encountered difficulties. He never lags behind in various charitable donations. He is absolutely open about finances within the family and is not selfish, but he has a strong personality, is overly subjective, and arrogant. Sometimes during meals, when I disagree with him on some small issue, he immediately puts down his bowl and refuses to eat, until I repeatedly admit I was wrong before he will eat. When I ask him to study, he says, "It's too hard pedaling the cart every day!" After work, he rests in bed. Although he likes to read progressive books, he never wants to participate in study. He also rarely attends pedicab workers' meetings.
　　My personality is also not very good. I often complain when things don't go my way. I am arrogant at home and have a straightforward personality, but I am also willing to help my friends of the same class and I believe strongly in the workers' party.
　　Because we both have strong opinions, we often disagree. When I was taking classes at the trade union, I often heard Chairman Liang Feng say, "When disagreements and difficulties arise, we must pursue the reasons and the truth." So my thinking changed. It is not a good thing for the family to disagree over small matters from time to time. At the same time, with so much income in the family, and the finances not being very abundant, I must find out the reason. In the end, I discovered that it was because there was no plan for finances and no discipline in the family. So we all discussed it and prepared to make a "1951 Family Covenant." After five meetings and discussions, I realized that my previous arrogant thinking was wrong. We elected my third younger sister-in-law, Fan Zhongping, as the head of our family group, and Fan Yongtian is in charge of discipline. We established a covenant, stipulating that we set up a public money box, limiting the daily food expenses to 7,500 yuan; making meat soup once every five days, with the soup cost being 10,000 yuan; and holding a review meeting every seven days to review whether the discipline and plans of our group were being effectively implemented. We will summarize every three months. In the covenant, everyone also put forward guarantees to overcome shortcomings.
　　Fan Yongtian proposed: 1. Guarantee to intensify study and improve political understanding; 2. Guarantee not to be angry and not to express personal opinions.
　　I proposed: 1. Guarantee not to be angry, not to raise my voice, not to express personal opinions, and to buy and eat whatever vegetables are available; 2. Patiently tutor the two younger sisters-in-law in reviewing literacy every night, and no longer say that the pedicab is all mine (previously, part of the purchase of the car was from family savings, and part was borrowed from friends).
　　Fan Zhongping guarantees: to get up immediately upon being called every morning, not to express personal opinions, and to patiently educate Fan Aiping in reading.
　　Fan Aiping guarantees: to strengthen memory (she is forgetful), pay attention to cleanliness, and not be sulky (not like to talk).
　　In addition, the covenant also sets out rewards and penalties. Those who can implement the guarantee and overcome shortcomings will be rewarded with a set of clothes; if they are angry, they will be penalized with washing the floor and cooking for the first time, reviewing and criticizing for the second and third times, and not making clothes for the fourth time or more.
　　Our family covenant has been established for two and a half months now. During this period, the fastest progress has been made by Fan Yongtian. His political understanding has greatly improved, he has also learned to play the waist drum, and he is very active in learning culture. He got 100 points in geography homework, and his temperament has also changed. He is not as subjective as before.
　　My temper and attitude have also changed, and I have overcome my irritable and arrogant temper. I was angry once and was penalized with washing the floor once.
　　Fan Zhongping has made great progress through the education of the Youth League and the trade union. She gets up on time every day, and her cultural level and political understanding have improved.
　　Fan Aiping has also changed, becoming more talkative, and her memory is stronger than before.
　　Recently, we have also established a family patriotic covenant: 1. Do a good job in the "five support" work; 2. Support the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, oppose American imperialism rearming Japan, and we must improve political understanding, learn culture and entertainment.
　　In addition, my husband has also made a personal provision: If he discovers suspicious people carrying smuggled goods in his pedicab, he will definitely take the people and the goods to the nearby branch bureau or tax bureau to report them.

### 我们的家庭公约

　　我们的家庭公约
    女工  叶丽馨
    我的家庭有四个人，除我之外，有我的爱人范永添，和他的三妹范仲平，六妹范爱平。我的爱人范永添，业三轮车，他每月平均收入约四十万元左右，我每月收入二十八万，小姑范仲平每月收入三十五万元，合计收入一百零三万元。收入足敷支出，而且有余，但因为各人性格不同，处理家务又无计划，我和爱人时时吵嘴，使家庭经济每陷于不敷的状态。
    我爱人对于朋友很够义气，肯帮助工友，有时把衣服赠给朋友做小生意。在四月九日那天，家里只余一万元，因为有朋友遇了困难，他毫不思索地就把钱送了朋友，遇到各种义捐，他也从不后人。他在家庭内财政绝对公开，不会自私，但个性很强，主观过重，自高自大。有时在食饭的时候，我因些小的问题闹意见时，他即马上放下饭碗不吃，一直到我多次认错了，方肯吃饭。我叫他学习，他说：“每天踏车太辛苦！”他收工后便在床上休息，对于进步书籍，虽然爱看，但总不肯参加学习，三轮车工人开会，也很少参加。
    我的性格也不大好，遇有一点不如意事，常大发牢骚，在家自高自大，个性率直，但对同阶级的朋友，也肯帮助，对于工人的政党很信仰。
    因为两人主观都强，所以时常发生意见。我在工会上课时常常听见主席梁峰同志说：“发生意见和遇到困难，一定要追求原因和真理。”于是我的思想起了变动。家庭时常因小事而发生意见，不是一件好事，同时，家庭有这么多的入息，而经济不大充裕，我必得找出原因来。结果发现了是因为在经济上无计划和家庭中无纪律的缘故。于是我们大家讨论，准备订一个“一九五一年的家庭公约”。经过五次开会讨论，我觉悟以前自大的思想是错误的。我们选三妹范仲平为我们家庭的小组长，范永添管纪律。订了一个公约，规定设一个公共钱盒，每天限定七千五百元餸钱；五天煲一次肉汤，煲汤费用一万元；七天开一次检讨会，检讨我们小组的纪律和计划是否切实执行了。三个月总结一次。在公约中每个人又提出克服缺点的保证。
    范永添提出：１保证加紧学习，提高政治认识，２保证不发脾气，不闹个人意见。
    我提出：１保证不发脾气，不大声大气，不闹个人意见，买什么菜吃什么菜；２耐心每晚教二个小姑温习识字，不再说三轮车是我所有的（以前购车时部分是用家中积蓄，部分是向友人借来的）。
    范仲平保证：每天早晨一叫即起床，不闹个人意见，耐心教育范爱平读书。
    范爱平保证：加强记忆力（她善忘），注意清洁，不鼓气（不爱说话）。
    此外，公约中又定出奖则和罚则。能实行保证，克服缺点的奖衫一套；如发脾气，第一次罚洗地煮饭、第二、三次检讨批评，四次以上，罚不做衫。
    我们的家庭公约订立已两个半月了，在这期间进步最快的是范永添，他的政治认识已有很大进步，又学会了打腰鼓，学习文化很积极，地理习作一百分，脾性也改变了，也没有以前的主观了。
    我的脾性和态度，也转变过来了，克服了暴躁自大的脾气。我曾发过一次脾气，被罚洗过一次地。
    范仲平经青年团和工会的教育，很有进步，每天都依时起身，文化水平和政治认识都提高了。
    范爱平也转变过来，变得爱说话了，记忆力也比从前增强了。
    最近，我们又订立了家庭的爱国公约：１要做好五拥工作，２支援抗美援朝运动，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，一定要提高政治认识，学习文化娱乐。
    此外，我爱人个人又订了一条：如发现可疑的人带走私货物乘车，他一定将人与货一齐踏到附近的分局或税局报告。（原载五月八日联合报）
