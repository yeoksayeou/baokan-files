	"June 6th" Teachers' Day Abolished
    "May 1st" Adopted as Teachers' Day
    Written Statements by Minister Ma Xulun and Chairman Wu Yuzhang
    Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, Ma Xulun, and Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union, Wu Yuzhang, issued written statements regarding the abolition of "June 6th" Teachers' Day and the adoption of "May 1st" Labor Day as the holiday for teachers at all levels of schools:
    "June 6th" Teachers' Day was a festival fought for and established by the teachers themselves during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Commemorating this festival at that time had a certain progressive significance. However, since the Chinese people's revolution achieved a great victory and the People's Republic of China was born, all our teachers and all education workers have their own trade union organizations and have become part of the working class of the new China. The teachers' struggle goals are consistent with those of all working people. Therefore, retaining a separate festival for themselves no longer has much significance. After joint discussions, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union believe that "June 6th" Teachers' Day should be abolished, and "May 1st" Labor Day should be adopted as the holiday for teachers at all levels of schools. When celebrating this great festival, all our teachers and all education workers should deeply recognize the glory of being part of the working class ranks, raise their level of awareness, unite as one, and strive for the cause of people's education in the motherland.

　　“六六”教师节废除
    改用“五一”为教师节
    马叙伦部长、吴玉章主席发表书面谈话
    中央人民政府教育部部长马叙伦和中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章，为废除“六六”教师节，改用“五一”劳动节为各级学校教师的节日事，发表书面谈话如下：
    “六六”教师节，是国民党反动统治时期，教师们自己争取订定的节日。在当时纪念这个节日是有着一定的进步意义的。但是，自从中国人民革命取得了伟大的胜利，中华人民共和国诞生以后，我们全体教师和全体教育工作者，已经有了自己的工会组织，已成为新中国工人阶级的一部分，教师们的奋斗目标与全体劳动人民是一致的，因此，再保留一个自己的节日，已无多大意义。中央人民政府教育部和中国教育工会全国委员会经共同商讨后，认为应废除“六六”教师节，改用“五一”劳动节为各级学校教师的节日。我们全体教师，全体教育工作者，在庆祝这伟大的节日的时候，应该深切地认识到自己列身工人阶级队伍的光荣，提高自己的觉悟程度，团结一致，为祖国的人民教育事业而奋斗。
