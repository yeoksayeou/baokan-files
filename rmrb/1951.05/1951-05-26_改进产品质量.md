　　Improving Product Quality
    Product quality is one of the important criteria for measuring the quality of an enterprise's management. Continuously improving product quality is a characteristic of people's enterprises.
    Currently, in our industrial production, two different results often occur under the same conditions. One is truly completing the tasks assigned by the state, not only paying attention to quantity but also ensuring quality; the other is only focusing on completing quantity, regardless of the quality. As a result, the former satisfies the needs of the people and the country; for the enterprise itself, the products are sold quickly, the capital turnover is fast, creating wealth for the country, and improving the lives of the workers. The latter leads to greater waste with more production, and for the enterprise itself, products cannot be sold, capital is tied up, and the reputation is very bad. Although the former situation is predominant in our factories and mines, the low quality of products is still a widespread and significant problem that deserves profound attention.
    Since the industrial conference in Northeast China last year, preliminary results have been achieved in improving quality over the past year. Recently, a comprehensive quality inspection campaign has been launched to establish and strengthen a series of technical management systems during this campaign. These efforts can not only be promoted in Northeast China but also have significant implications for factories and mines across the country. In particular, the formulation of quality standard specifications for major products, the revision and addition of technical operating procedures, the strict implementation of inspection and supervision systems, the stipulation of product trial production procedures, and the convening of professional technical conferences to study and improve quality are not only necessary but also achievable. The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government is currently holding a steel conference to study steel quality issues.
    Strengthening technical management is an important aspect of improving product quality; at the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen publicity and education to solve problems ideologically. It is necessary to deeply and constantly educate workers to establish a correct concept of valuing quality. Advanced experiences should be summarized in a timely manner, and units and individuals who have contributed to improving quality should be commended; those who produce poor quality should be promptly exposed and criticized.
    Some people are afraid that publicly exposing quality problems will affect the reputation of factories and mines and affect product sales. This concern is unnecessary. If the product quality of a factory or mine is not good, it will never gain credibility or expand sales by hiding the problems. Because all products are either for national construction or for the needs of people's lives. Therefore, hiding the shortcomings of product quality is irresponsible to the people. We are not afraid to expose the shortcomings of product quality; the sooner we expose them, the sooner we can find ways to improve them; and we can educate ourselves and the masses to pay attention to quality issues and jointly find solutions. Only the reputation built on the basis of improved quality is solid.
    Improving quality is a long-term goal. Party workers, enterprise managers, and trade union workers in factories should regard this as a regular task and continuously struggle to improve product quality.

### 改进产品质量

　　改进产品质量
    产品质量是测量一个企业经营管理好坏的重要标准之一。不断改进产品质量，是人民企业的一个特色。
    目前在我们的工业生产中，常常在同样的条件下，产生两种不同的结果。一种是真正地完成了国家交给的任务，不仅注意了数量，而且保证了质量；另一种是只管完成数量，不注意质量好坏。结果，前者是满足了人民、国家的需要；对本企业来说，产品推销得快，资金周转也快，为国家创造了财富，同时改善了职工的生活。另一种是生产愈多浪费愈大，对企业本身来说，产品推销不出去，资金积压，信誉很坏。虽然在我们的厂、矿中还是前一种情况居多，但产品质量不高，仍是一个普遍地、大量地存在的问题，值得深刻地注意。
    东北区自去年的工业会议以后，一年来在改进质量方面已收到了初步效果。最近又发动了全面的质量大检查运动，要在这个运动中，建立与加强技术管理制度等一系列的工作。这些工作不仅在东北可以推行，在全国各厂、矿中也有重大的意义。特别像制订主要产品的质量标准规格、修正与增订技术操作规程、严格执行检验制度和监督制度、规定产品试制规程、召开专业的技术会议研究改进质量等，不仅是必须做的，而且也是能够做的。中央人民政府重工业部最近就正在召开钢铁会议，研究钢铁质量问题。
    加强技术管理，是提高产品质量的一个重要方面；同时还必须加强宣传教育工作，从思想上解决问题。要深入地经常地教育职工，树立重视质量的正确观念。要及时地总结先进经验，对于改善质量有贡献的单位和个人给以表扬；对生产质量低劣的应及时地予以揭露和批评。
    有些人害怕把质量上的毛病公开揭发出来，会影响厂、矿的信誉，会影响产品的销路，这种顾虑是不必要的。某一厂、矿产品质量不好，绝不会因为把毛病隐藏起来而取得信誉、扩大销路。因为所有产品，不是供国家建设之用，就是供人民生活之需。因此隐藏产品质量的缺点，就是对人民不负责任。我们不怕揭露产品质量上的缺点，愈早地揭露，就可以愈早地找到改进的门径；就能够教育自己、教育群众重视质量问题，共同来想办法解决。只有在改进质量基础上建立起来的信誉，才是牢靠的。
    改进质量是一个长期的奋斗目标，工厂中党的工作者、企业管理者、工会工作者应该把这作为一个经常的工作，为提高产品质量而不断地进行斗争。
