    (Four) After No. 800 departed, Guan Changhai was just about to go to the operations room to call the forward station to coordinate the departure when enemy planes strafed with a volley of machine gun fire, followed by bombs, one after another.
    (Five) Two minutes later, the enemy planes flew away. The phone call from the forward station said: “No. 800 has safely entered the tunnel.” The ammunition truck parked in the station had been set on fire by the enemy planes. The ammunition exploded, and bullets whizzed overhead.
    (Six) "This is a weapon for the front-line troops to kill the enemy. We can’t just watch it burn into scrap iron!" There are still two locomotives and the remaining vehicles, there is still time to salvage them. Guan Changhai said to the drivers Qin Deshan and Liu Fengqi: "Comrades, let's go! Rescue the locomotives and ammunition!"

    （四）八○○号开出去后，关长海刚要到运转室去打电话，和前方站联系发车，敌人的飞机上一排机关炮弹猛烈地打了下来，接着就是一个接着一个的炸弹。
    （五）两分钟后，敌机飞走了，前方站的电话中说：“八○○号已安全进入山洞。”站内停放的弹药车，被敌机打起了火。弹药爆炸了，子弹吱吱地从头上飞过。
    （六）“这是前方部队杀敌利器，不能眼看着烧成废铁啊！”还有两台机车和剩下的车辆，抢救还来得及。关长海对司机秦德善和刘凤岐说：“同志，走！抢救机车和军火去！”
