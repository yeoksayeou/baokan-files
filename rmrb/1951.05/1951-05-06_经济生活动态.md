Heilongjiang Province Farmers Break Past Habits, Apply Manure and Fertilizer to Most Farmland

    Farmers in Heilongjiang Province, who previously had no habit of fertilizing most of their farmland, are now actively applying manure and fertilizer to complete the agricultural production increase task, breaking with this habit. According to preliminary statistics from 34 counties including Lindian and Zhaodong, over 1,389,000 hectares of land have been manured, accounting for 69% of the province's original planned manured area.

    Furthermore, the province has systematically trained a large number of production team leaders in rural areas to improve their production skills and leadership abilities. According to incomplete statistics from 30 counties including Hailun and Nehe as of April 11th, over 30,700 production team leaders have been trained. In addition, over 800 experienced farmers, 250 agricultural technicians, 30 model laborers, and over 100 production committee members have also received training.

Jilin Province Completes Spring Wheat and Flax Sowing

    Jilin Province has begun its intensive spring sowing work. The province has organized over 150 cadres to go to the countryside in early April to specifically lead spring plowing work. Currently, over 40,000 hectares of spring wheat land in the province were sown by April 10th, and some spring wheat has already emerged. The province's flax sowing area of 9,500 hectares has also been mostly sown. Starting from Grain Rain (April 21st), a small number of farmers in Yanji County have started sowing millet, Changchun County has started sowing sunflowers, and other counties have started planting potatoes. Of the province's 74,000 hectares of paddy fields, 80% had been prepared by Grain Rain. Farmers in the five counties of Yanbian, as well as Jiaohe and Shulan counties, are preparing to harrow for the second time. It is estimated that large-scale plowing and planting can be universally started in early May.

Guangdong Wuchuan County Expands Jute Sowing Area

    Guangdong's Wuchuan County is rich in jute production. Fertilizer is the biggest factor affecting the amount of jute yield. Last year, the county planted over 12,000 mu of jute, but due to insufficient fertilizer, the average yield was only 150 jin per mu. This year, the People's Government allocated 1.3 billion yuan in jute loans to help jute farmers solve the difficulty of not having money to buy fertilizer. The morale of the jute farmers is high, and they have put forward the slogan of "intensive cultivation and meticulous farming to strive for a bumper harvest." According to statistics, the county's jute planting area has been expanded to 20,000 mu this year. If the average yield per mu can be doubled to 300 jin, the county can produce 60,000 dan, an increase of 42,000 dan compared to last year.

    黑龙江省农民打破过去习惯作到大部农田上粪施肥
    黑龙江省农民，过去对耕地大部没有施肥习惯，今年为完成农业增产任务，已打破这种习惯，正积极进行上粪施肥。据林甸、肇东等三十四个县初步统计，已有一百三十八万九千多垧地上了粪，占全省原计划上粪田的百分之六十九。
    又该省至目前止，已有计划地训练了大批农村中的生产小组长，以提高他们的生产技术与领导能力。据四月十一日海伦、讷河等三十个县不完全统计，共已训练生产小组长三万零七百余人。另外有八百多名老农，二百五十名农业技术员，三十名劳动模范及生产委员一百多人都受到了训练。
    吉林省春麦亚麻播种完毕
     吉林全省已开始紧张的春播工作。该省已组织一百五十余干部于四月初下乡具体领导春耕工作。现全省四万余垧春麦地已在四月十日播完，并有部分春麦已经出土。全省亚麻播种面积九千五百垧也已大部种完。从谷雨开始（四月二十一日），延吉县已有少数农民播种谷子，长春县开始播种向日葵，其他县已在种土豆（即马铃薯）等。全省七万四千余垧水田，到谷雨止，已有百分之八十的地已耠完，延边五县及蛟河、舒兰等县农民正准备耠第二遍。估计在五月初可以普遍开犁种大田。
    广东吴川县扩大黄麻播种面积
    广东吴川县盛产黄麻。黄麻产量的多少，肥料是最大的因素。去年全县植麻面积一万二千多市亩，因肥料不足，每亩平均只收一百五十斤。今年人民政府拨下麻贷十三亿元帮助麻农解决无钱买肥料的困难，麻农情绪高涨，纷纷提出了“精耕细作，争取丰收”的口号。据统计：该县今年植麻面积已扩至二万市亩，如果每亩平均可增产一倍即三百斤，全县即可产六万市担，比去年增产四万二千市担。
