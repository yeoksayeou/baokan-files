　　Village Cadres in Xiaguan Donglixi, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, Should Not Interfere with Freedom of Marriage
To the Editor:
    I am from Donglixi, Xiaguan, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, and am twenty-one years old this year. Seven or eight years ago, my father arranged a child bride for me named Yin Hehua. Last year, Yin Hehua's parents asked the township head and others to urge my father to arrange our marriage as soon as possible. I firmly opposed it, and the matter was delayed.
    Last December, my father came to Shanghai from the countryside, saying that the township head and others believed my unwillingness to marry Yin Hehua was due to instigation by my uncle (who had also proposed dissolving the engagement); therefore, they wanted to criticize my uncle. To avoid implicating others, my father insisted that I return home to testify. On the second night after I returned home, the township head Xu Jingyao, village head Xu Shanzheng, village farmers' association director Xu A'gen, and more than ten others came to my house and demanded that I agree to the marriage. I said I needed to consider it for two more days. However, the township head and others said that if I didn't reply today, they would hold a mass meeting tomorrow to criticize my uncle. My uncle and others, fearing I would implicate them, also begged me to agree. Under these circumstances, I was forced to reluctantly agree. I asked them to allow me to marry in the second half of the year; but they insisted that I marry immediately. So, under their arrangement, I got married.
    I believe that my marriage and the criticism of my uncle are two separate matters and should not be mixed together. If my uncle should indeed be criticized, he should not be spared because I agreed to the marriage. If my uncle should not be criticized, it is illegal to find fault with him because I do not agree to the marriage.
    The township head and others in my village forced me to marry Yin Hehua, which violates the Marriage Law. I do not agree to the marriage arranged by them. I hope the relevant authorities will resolve this issue.

### 浙江上虞县下管东里溪乡村干部不应干涉婚姻自由

　　浙江上虞县下管东里溪乡村干部不应干涉婚姻自由编辑同志：
    我是浙江省上虞县下管东里溪人，今年二十一岁。七八年前，父亲给我领了一个童养媳，名叫尹荷花。去年，尹荷花的家长曾数次请乡长等催我父亲给我早日完婚。我坚决反对，事情就拖延下来。
    去年十二月，我父亲自乡下赶来上海，说乡长等认为我不愿和尹荷花结婚是受我叔叔的挑拨（他也提出了解除婚约的要求）；所以要斗争我叔叔。为的怕连累他人，所以我父亲一定要我回去作证明。在我回家的第二天晚上，乡长徐敬尧、村长徐善正、村农会主任徐阿根等十余人到我家里来，要我答应这桩婚事。我说要再考虑两天。但是乡长等却说今天我不答复，明天他们就要开群众大会斗争我叔叔。我叔叔等怕我连累他们，也哀求我答应。在这种情况下，我被迫委屈地答应了。我要求他们允许我在下半年结婚；但他们一定要我马上结婚。于是，我便在他们的摆布下结了婚。
    我认为：我的婚事和斗争我叔叔是两桩事，不能混在一起。假使我叔叔确应被斗争，不能因我答应婚事而不斗争。假使我叔叔不应被斗争，因我不答应婚事而硬寻错处是非法的。
    我乡乡长等强迫我和尹荷花结婚，这是违反婚姻法的。我对他们所包办的婚姻，是不同意的。希望有关机关解决这个问题。
              上海  徐国治
    编者按：希望上虞县人民政府检查处理这件事情，并将结果告诉我们。
