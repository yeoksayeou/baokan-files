Column: Letter from a Model Worker

    I Want to Learn from Comrade Zhang Shuyi’s Example Editor, please forward to Comrade Zhang Shuyi, a model disabled veteran in production:
    Your exemplary deeds have greatly educated me. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I served as the deputy leader of the militia in my village. Once, the traitor Gao Hongji led a battalion of soldiers to attack our village. I led eight militiamen to fight the enemy for seven hours using tall houses, repelling the enemy's charges several times. It was during this battle that my right leg was injured and later amputated during treatment. Afterwards, I felt entitled because of my contribution, and I relied on government subsidies for living expenses. I would just loaf around after eating, not participating in any labor. Later, I heard that you were also a disabled veteran, but you overcame all difficulties, worked hard in production, and became a production model. Your deeds greatly inspired me, and I resolved to actively engage in production. Last spring, our village suffered from heavy rains and disasters, and everyone's life was very difficult. I walked to the low-lying areas every day with my crutches to sweep alkali soil and boil saltpeter, totaling more than 600 jin, which I exchanged for 200 jin of grain, solving the living problems of my family of three. Now my family farms a total of 28 mu of land, cultivated by me and an 18-year-old brother-in-law. This spring, I also responded to the government's call and planted cotton. I planted more than half a mu in one day. When repairing the dikes, I formed a group with two women. I dug the soil, and they carried it. In three days, we completed 27 cubic meters of earthwork.
    The reason I can work like this is because your glorious deeds have motivated me, so I am very grateful to you. I hope that all veterans will learn from you and work hard in production.

    Editor's Note: Zhang Shuyi is a disabled veteran who has lost both legs (below the knees). However, he did not stop working because of this; instead, he is an excellent agricultural producer and was elected a national agricultural labor model representative in 1950.

### 我要学习张树义的榜样

专栏：劳动模范来信

    我要学习张树义的榜样编辑同志请转荣军生产模范张树义同志：
    你的模范事迹给了我很大的教育。在抗日战争时期，我在村里担任民兵副队长。一次，汉奸高洪基带领一营兵向我村袭击，我带领八个民兵利用高房与敌搏斗了七个钟头，阻击了敌人数次冲锋。就在这一次作战中，我的右腿受伤，并在医治时锯掉了。以后我就自持有功，生活费用依赖政府供给。我每天吃了饭一呆，不参加任何劳动。后来听说你也是一个残废荣誉军人，却克服一切困难，努力生产当了生产模范。你的事迹，给了我很大的启发，使我下定决心积极生产。去年春天我村雨大成灾，大家生活都很困难。我每天拄着拐杖下洼地扫碱土熬硝，共熬了六百余斤，换粮二百斤，解决了全家三口人生活问题。现在我家共种地二十八亩，由我和一个十八岁的内弟两人耕种。今年春天我也响应政府号召，种了棉花，自己在一天之内就种好了半亩多。修堤时我和两个妇女组成了一个小组，我挖土，她俩抬土，三天的工夫，完成了二十七个土方。
    我所以能这样劳动，是由于你的光荣事迹所带动的，因此我很感激你。希望所有的荣誉军人都向你学习，努力劳动生产。
          河北省青县五区西魏村  邵世轩
    编者注：张树义是一个失去了两条腿（膝盖以下）的荣誉军人，但是，他并没有因此停止劳动；却是一个优秀的农业生产者，一九五○年，当选全国农业劳动模范代表。
