    Songs on the Riverbank
    ——A Record of the Women's River Management Team in Guzhen, Yutian County
    Gao Huisheng
    I walked along the banks of the Huanxiang River in Yutian County, Hebei Province, and heard a burst of loud singing: "Build the river embankment well to grow more grain, have enough to eat and wear, and enjoy a good life; people who love peace unite and resist America and aid Korea with strength!" The singers were a group of women with white towels wrapped around their heads, who were lifting a large stone rammer weighing 180 pounds, pounding the new soil on the river embankment with a "bang, bang" sound. This is the women's labor team of East Main Street in Guzhen, Yutian County. This women's labor team was organized during the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
    On the day before they set off for the embankment, each of them made a vow: to repair the embankment well and increase the strength to resist America and aid Korea. After they went to the embankment, they competed with the male workers, and as a result, the half-month's river work was completed in ten days.
    After this news spread in the town, more than a hundred women followed and went to the embankment. Merchants and residents in the town donated cigarettes, sugar, tea, and other items to慰劳 [wèiláo - express sympathy and appreciation to] them. Wu Fen, a revolutionary soldier's family member in her sixties, volunteered to boil water for them to drink every day. The Yutian County Water Conservancy Committee also awarded them a banner of "River Management Model." This red banner fluttered in the wind on the river embankment, and everyone looked at it and smiled!

    河堤上的歌声
    ——记玉田县沽镇妇女治河队
    高惠生
    我在河北省玉田县还乡河堤上走过，听到一阵响亮的歌声：“搭好河埝多打粮，有吃有穿好风光；爱好和平的人民团结起，抗美援朝有力量！”唱歌的是一群头上围着白毛巾的妇女，她们正在抬着一百八十斤重的大石夯，砰砰地在砸着河埝上的新土。这是玉田县沽镇东大街妇女民工队。这个妇女民工队，是在抗美援朝运动中组织起来的。
    她们在临出发上埝的头一天，每一个人都发出了誓言：要把堤埝修好，增加抗美援朝的力量。她们上了埝以后，就和男工搞竞赛，结果半月的河工任务，十天就完成了。
    这消息在镇上传开后，又有一百多名妇女跟着上了埝。镇上的商民捐献了纸烟，糖、茶叶等来慰劳她们。六十多岁的革命军人家属吴芬老大爷，自愿每天来给她们烧水喝。玉田县水利委员会也奖给她们一面“治河模范”的奖旗。这面红色的奖旗在河堤上迎风飘展着，看大家望着它笑呵！
