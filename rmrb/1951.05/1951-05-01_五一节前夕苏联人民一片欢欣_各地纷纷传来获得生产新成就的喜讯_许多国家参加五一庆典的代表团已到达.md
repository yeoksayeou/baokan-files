Xinhua News Agency, April 29th Dispatch from TASS: On the eve of May Day, the Soviet Union is filled with joy. Spring is deepening in Moscow, and the lilacs, lilies of the valley, tulips, and lush green trees in the wide streets and squares set off the red flags and streamers celebrating the festival in a particularly striking manner. Tall buildings are hung with portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and other Soviet leaders. A large map of the construction sites of major hydroelectric power stations hangs on the walls of the Central Telegraph Office. Everywhere you can see brightly colored banners with slogans such as "Stakhanovite labor is our best contribution to world peace."

In response to the call of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, major industrial enterprises in Moscow have launched a vigorous labor upsurge, and many workers have joined "peace work shifts." Workers at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory using accelerated steelmaking methods have produced an unprecedented amount of metal. Workers at the "Red Proletarian" factory overfulfilled the production plan for machine tools in April. Bright red triangular flags are flying on the construction site of Moscow University, indicating that the construction workers have completed this month's plan and are proceeding with next month's work. Markets and shops are crowded with customers, and sales have doubled in the past few days. In areas such as Leningrad Road, many apartment buildings have been completed, and many residents are holding banquets to celebrate moving into their new homes. The people of Moscow have sent tens of thousands of telegrams to relatives and friends across the country, congratulating them on their new achievements in labor and study.

Foreign guests have arrived in Moscow one after another to participate in the May Day celebrations. Delegations from China, Korea, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, and Finland have arrived.

News of new production achievements continues to arrive from all regions. The preparation for testing a new powerful turbine at the Leningrad Stalin Steel Plant was completed four days ahead of schedule. The Kuznetsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works, the largest in Siberia, overfulfilled its April steel production plan by thousands of tons. The Kuznetsk, Karaganda and other coal mining areas are preparing gifts for the state for May Day. More than 100 factories in Lithuania have completed their four-month production plans ahead of schedule. Soviet farmers in the middle reaches of the Volga River, the central Russian provinces, and Siberia are stepping up spring sowing, determined to make this year's harvest even better than last year. Many new houses have been built on collective farms, and thousands of farmers will welcome the happy May Day in their new homes.
