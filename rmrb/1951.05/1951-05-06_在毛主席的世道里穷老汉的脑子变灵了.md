　　In the Era of Chairman Mao, the Poor Old Man's Mind Became Sharp

To the Editor:
    Living in the countryside after the land reform, one constantly encounters touching events. On April 12th, I went to the countryside to investigate the situation of draught cattle. As soon as I left Anqing city, I met an old man, about fifty years old. He carried a shovel on his right shoulder and held a wooden stick in his left hand, with a small square piece of wood nailed to it. I was about to ask him for directions when he greeted me with a smile, "Comrade, please see if the number of mu written above is correct!" He held out the wooden sign. I read the words written on the wooden sign: "Guangxu District, Xinhe Township, Duanbei Village, Second Group, Lu Jinyou, allocated a piece of landlord's land, totaling 3.2 mu." He nodded with a smile. Then he asked me again, "Comrade, can you see the other side of the wooden sign? Is 'Long Live Chairman Mao' written correctly? With Chairman Mao, there is the next sentence, take a look: 'Tenant land changed to own land, for generations and generations, forever and ever.' Is it written correctly too? I didn't sleep half the night, and I came up with such an auspicious sentence. Do you think it's all written correctly?" "All written correctly, you thought very well!" I said. "Very well? Haha! In Chairman Mao's era, this poor old man's mind has become much sharper." I was far away from him, and when I looked back, he was still watching his 3.2 mu of land with his hands behind his back. Lu Jinyou's happiness made me forget the fatigue of walking, and I only thought about doing my work better.

　　在毛主席的世道里穷老汉的脑子变灵了编辑同志：
    生活在土地改革后的农村里，时刻会遇到使你感动的事情。四月十二日，我到乡下去调查耕牛情况。一出安庆城，就遇着一个约摸有五十多岁的老汉，他右肩扛着一把锹；左手拿着根木棒，上面钉着一小块正方形的木板。我正要向他问路，他却抢先笑盈盈的向我打了招呼：“同志，请你看看上面写的亩数对不对呀！”他把木牌伸过来。我念着木牌上面写的字：“广圩区新河乡断碑村第二组鲁进友分到地主田一块，计三亩二分。”他微笑着点点头。接着他又问我：“同志，你可看到木牌的另一面吗？‘毛主席万岁’写对了没有？有了毛主席，才有了下一句，你再看看：‘佃田改自田，子子孙孙万万年，’也写对了吧？俺半夜没睡，想出了这样个吉利句。你看都写对了吧？”“都写对了，你想得很好哩！”我说。“很好吗，哈哈！毛主席的世道，我这穷老汉脑子也灵的多了。”我离开他很远了，回过头来看看，他还在背着手注视着他那三亩二分田。鲁进友的高兴，使我忘记了走路的疲劳，我一心只想着要把工作做得更好一点。
