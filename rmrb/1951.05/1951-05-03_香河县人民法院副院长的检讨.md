　　Self-Criticism of the Deputy President of the Xianghe County People's Court

To the Editor:
    I am now making the following self-criticism regarding our court's handling of the case of Zhao Xiang and others in Wangdianzi Village, who were accused of "plotting to seize village power":
    On November 5th of last year, we received four defendants—Zhao Xiang, Wang Decai, Wen Fubao, and Li Shuxuan—along with supporting materials, from Wei Zhen, the Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the First District. The materials stated briefly that Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai had recently gathered over thirty people for a secret meeting, planning to seize village power, and had instructed Wen and Li to assassinate village cadre Li Xirong with guns. We heard that this case was about "reactionary elements trying to seize power, which led to the thought, 'There's no problem, we must arrest them and investigate them thoroughly.'" However, after detaining the people based on the materials from the district, we did not conduct any investigation or interrogation for more than three months. This is a serious manifestation of bureaucratic work style. At the same time, we did not promptly correct the illegal behavior of the district cadres in directly arresting people without approval. This also shows that the court itself did not sufficiently emphasize the importance of human rights. For this, I sincerely request the higher authorities to give me the appropriate punishment to educate myself and other comrades.
    At the same time, I am determined to remember this lesson and prevent similar mistakes from happening again.
          Gao Qizhan, Deputy President of the Xianghe County People's Court
    Editor's Note: Regarding the issues raised in the letter from reader Li Shucheng, we also dispatched reporters to conduct investigations in coordination. The occurrence and progress of the issues are as described in the investigation report of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Tongxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party.
    We believe that certain county and district cadres in Xianghe County are severely lacking in a mass perspective in their work. Certain cadres in Wangdianzi Village, First District of the county, have long exhibited serious detachment from the masses, and the leading cadres of the First District were completely unaware of this. When the masses filed complaints about this issue, the county and district leading cadres still did not investigate or study the matter, turning a deaf ear; and they listened to the erroneous reflections of the village cadres, detaining the masses and violating human rights. Regarding such a serious detachment from the masses, in addition to giving the cadres who made mistakes the appropriate punishment and handling it seriously, the leaders of Xianghe County should also use this event to conduct in-depth education on the mass line among the cadres, and earnestly inspect and correct the bad work style of cadres being detached from the masses.

### 香河县人民法院副院长的检讨

　　香河县人民法院副院长的检讨编辑同志：
    现在我把我院对王店子村赵祥等“谋夺村政权”一案的处理作如下检讨：
    去年十一月五日，我们接到一区中共区委书记魏珍送来赵祥、王德才、温福保、李树宣等人犯四名并材料一份。材料略称：赵祥与王德才近日拉拢三十多人秘密开会，计划夺取村政权并主使温、李二人持枪谋杀村干部李锡荣。我们听说这案子是“反动分子要夺取政权，就产生了‘没问题，得押起来好好地搞一搞’的思想。”但是我们根据区里的材料把人扣押起来后，却一直三个多月也没有进行调查或审讯。这是严重的官僚主义作风。同时对区干部这种未经批准便直接捕人的违法行为，也未及时加以纠正。这也说明法院本身对重视人权这一点作的很不够。对此，我诚恳地要求上级机关给我以应得的处分，以教育我自己和其他同志。
    同时我也决心保证记取这个教训，不使类似错误再次发生。
          香河县人民法院副院长  高起瞻
    编者按：对读者李树成来信所反映的问题，我们亦曾派记者协同进行调查。问题的发生及经过，正如中共通县地委纪律检查委员会调查报告所述。
    我们认为，香河县某些县、区干部在工作中十分缺乏群众观点。该县一区王店子村的某些干部长期存在着严重的脱离群众作风，而一区的领导干部对此却毫无所知。当群众对此问题提出控告后，县、区领导干部仍然是不调查，不研究，置若罔闻；并听信村干部的错误反映，扣押群众，侵犯人权。对这样严重的脱离群众作风，香河县的领导上除了给犯错误的干部以应得处分并认真处理外，还应该通过这一件事，在干部中进行深入的群众路线的教育，切实检查并纠正干部脱离群众的不良作风。
