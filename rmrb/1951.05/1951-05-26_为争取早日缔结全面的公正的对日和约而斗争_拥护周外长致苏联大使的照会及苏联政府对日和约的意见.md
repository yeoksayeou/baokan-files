　　Struggle for an Early Conclusion of a Comprehensive and Just Peace Treaty with Japan
    ——Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Note to the Soviet Ambassador and the Soviet Government's Opinion on the Japanese Peace Treaty
    On May 22nd, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, expressing that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the Soviet government's opinions on the American draft of the Japanese peace treaty and its specific proposals for preparing the Japanese peace treaty. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's note and the Soviet government's "Soviet Opinions on the American Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty," submitted to the United States on May 9th, thoroughly exposed the United States' sinister attempt to prepare a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan, and clearly put forward the principles and specific proposals for concluding a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable peace treaty with Japan. These principles and proposals not only conform to the interests of the Chinese and Soviet people but also conform to the interests of the people of all countries that fought against Japan and the Japanese people. The entire Chinese people fully support the principles for concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan put forward in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's note and the "Soviet Opinions on the American Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty," and resolutely oppose the American conspiracy to conclude a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan.
    China and the Soviet Union have consistently advocated for the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan to end the state of war with Japan, enable the Japanese people to achieve peace and democracy as soon as possible, and consolidate lasting peace in the Far East and the world. In his statement on the Japanese peace treaty issue on December 4, 1950, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly stated: "The basic policy of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is to strive to conclude a joint peace treaty with Japan within the shortest possible period." Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed by China and the Soviet Union as early as February 14, 1950, further stipulates: "The two contracting parties guarantee to jointly seek the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, in agreement with each other and with the other Allied powers in the Second World War, within the shortest possible time." Since the end of the war against Japan, the Soviet government has made unremitting efforts to conclude a joint peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. The consistent policy of China and the Soviet Union on the Japanese issue and the joint efforts made over the years fully demonstrate the sincere desire of the Chinese and Soviet people to resolve the Japanese issue peacefully with the people of all countries that fought against Japan and the Japanese people, and to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries and the Japanese people. However, since the end of the war against Japan, the United States has illegally abused its power as the occupying authority, deliberately delaying and obstructing the conclusion of a joint peace treaty with Japan in order to implement a long-term military occupation of Japan. For more than five years, the United States has turned Japan into its military base and colony in the Far East. After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, the United States openly carried out the conspiracy of concluding a separate peace with Japan, attempting to rearm the Japanese militarist forces and make them its tool of aggression for expanding the war. The "American Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" published by the United States on April 5 this year is the most public and shameless confession of this sinister conspiracy.
    Participating in the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty is the common task of all countries that fought against Japan, especially the sacred right of China and the Soviet Union, which made the greatest contributions to defeating Japanese imperialism. According to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement of August 2, 1945, the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted by a foreign ministers' conference composed of representatives from China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the four countries that signed the instrument of surrender, and be attended by relevant countries. However, the United States completely disregarded this solemn international agreement and the international obligations it undertook in this agreement, acted arbitrarily, prepared the draft of the Japanese peace treaty alone, and forced other countries to accept it. This is completely illegal and therefore invalid. The Chinese people will never recognize this draft of the Japanese peace treaty prepared without China's participation. China resisted Japan for the longest time, sacrificed the most, and contained the most Japanese army; the Soviet Union dispatched troops to Northeast China in August 1945 to participate in the war against Japan, and in one fell swoop defeated the elite of the Japanese fascist army. This was the main reason for Japan's unconditional surrender. Therefore, it is a matter of course that the only legitimate representative of the Chinese people—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet government—must participate in the preparation of the Japanese peace treaty. The Chinese people fully support the Soviet government's proposal that "a foreign ministers' conference composed of representatives from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should be convened in June or July 1951 to begin preparations for the Japanese peace treaty, and consideration should be given to the participation of representatives from all countries that participated in the war against Japan by force in the preparation of the Japanese peace treaty so that the draft peace treaty can be submitted to the peace conference for deliberation." Because this is the necessary way to achieve the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.
    The Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation are the main foundations of the common peace treaty with Japan for all countries that fought against Japan. Therefore, the draft of the Japanese peace treaty prepared with the joint participation of all countries must be drafted in accordance with the provisions of these international agreements. However, the "Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" unilaterally formulated by the United States is not only completely illegal in procedure but also completely overturns the basis of the common peace treaty with Japan stipulated in the above-mentioned international agreements in content. The Cairo Declaration clearly stipulated that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China and that Korea should be granted freedom and independence, while the US "draft" does not mention the issue of the ownership of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and does not affirm the freedom and independence of Korea. Its intention is clearly to attempt to invade and occupy the sacred territories of China and Korea mentioned above. More importantly, the US "draft" completely violates the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation regarding the elimination of Japanese militarist forces, and does not impose any restrictions on Japan's rearmament, in order to foster the revival of Japanese militarism and expand the war of aggression in Asia. At the same time, the United States disregards the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement that "We have no intention to enslave the Japanese nation or destroy its state" and that "The Allied occupying forces shall be withdrawn immediately after a peace-loving and responsible government has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people," but wants to maintain the long-term occupation of Japan by US troops in the form of a "US-Japan Security Agreement" in order to achieve its goal of destroying the Japanese state and making Japan its legal colony. In addition, the "political and economic provisions" of the US "draft" are also extremely vicious. It wants to enjoy "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" alone in Japan in order to endlessly exploit and oppress the Japanese people and exclude other countries from equal and mutually beneficial trade with Japan. This will put the Japanese economy to death. In short, the US "Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" is an imperialist criminal plan to plunder colonies, expand the war of aggression in Asia, and monopolize Japan to destroy the Japanese state and enslave the Japanese people. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of China and the Soviet Union, the people of Asia, and the Japanese people. Therefore, the Chinese people fully support the principles put forward by the Soviet government for drafting a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan, namely: the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty should be carried out in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, and should be guided by the following main objectives: A. Japan should become a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country; B. Democratic rights of the Japanese people should be guaranteed, and the existence of political, military, or militarized organizations aimed at depriving the people of democratic rights should not be permitted, as stipulated in the peace treaty with Italy; C. In order to ensure that Japanese militarism does not revive, the treaty should determine the limitations on the size of Japan's armed forces so that these armed forces do not exceed the requirements of self-defense, as stipulated in the peace treaty with Italy; D. No restrictions should be placed on the development of Japan's peaceful economy; E. All restrictions should be removed on trade relations between Japan and other countries. At the same time, in order to fundamentally eliminate any country's conspiracy to use Japan for aggressive acts and to ensure Japan's freedom and independence, the Chinese people also fully support the Soviet government's proposals that Japan should not participate in alliances aimed at opposing any of the Allied powers, and that all occupying forces should be withdrawn from Japan no later than one year after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, that foreign countries should not maintain troops in Japan, and that the signatory countries should jointly support Japan's accession to the United Nations. Because only in this way can the Japanese issue be resolved peacefully and justly, and the peace of Asia can thus be significantly guaranteed.
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's note and the "Soviet Opinions on the American Draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty" are a serious blow to the United States' sinister plan to prepare a separate peace with Japan and rearm Japan, and give unlimited encouragement to the struggle of the Chinese and Soviet people, the Asian people, and the Japanese people to strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world must fight to the end for the early and complete realization of the various just principles and specific proposals for the Japanese peace treaty put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and the Soviet government, in order to completely shatter all the conspiracies of US imperialism to use Japan to carry out a war of aggression.

　　为争取早日缔结全面的公正的对日和约而斗争
    ——拥护周外长致苏联大使的照会及苏联政府对日和约的意见
    我国外交部周恩来部长于本月二十二日照会苏联驻华大使罗申，表示中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见及其关于准备对日和约的具体建议。周恩来外交部长的照会及苏联政府于本月九日递交美国的《苏联关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》，彻底揭穿了美国准备对日单独媾和与重新武装日本的罪恶企图，并明确地提出了缔结一个全面的公平合理的对日和约的原则与具体建议。这些原则和建议不但符合于中苏两国人民的利益，而且也符合于所有对日作战国家人民和日本人民的利益。全中国人民完全拥护周恩来外交部长的照会与《苏联关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》中所提出的缔结全面对日和约的各项原则，并坚决反对美国单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋。
    中苏两国一贯主张早日缔结全面对日和约，以结束对日战争状态，使日本人民早日获得和平与民主，并巩固远东和世界的持久和平。在一九五○年十二月四日周恩来外交部长在关于对日和约问题的声明中，即曾郑重表明：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府的基本方针是力求于尽可能的短期内，缔结共同对日和约”。中苏两国早在一九五○年二月十四日所签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约的第二条，更曾规定：“缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结”。苏联政府在对日战争结束以来，即为早订共同对日和约进行了不懈的斗争。中苏两国对日问题的这种一贯方针和历年来所做的共同努力，充分表明了：中苏两国人民愿与其他所有对日作战国家人民及日本人民以和平方式解决日本问题，并与各国人民和日本人民和平共处的真诚愿望。然而美国却自对日战争结束以来，即非法地滥用其占领当局的权力，蓄意拖延与阻挠共同对日和约的缔结，以实行长期的对日军事占领。五年多以来，美国已把日本变为它在远东的军事基地与殖民地。侵朝战争发生以后，美国更公开地进行了对日单独媾和的阴谋活动，企图重新武装日本军国主义势力，使之充当其扩大战争的侵略工具。美国于今年四月五日所公布的《美国对日和约草案》，便是这种罪恶阴谋的最公开无耻的供状。
    参加拟制对日和约草案，是所有对日作战国家的共同任务，尤其是对击败日本帝国主义贡献最大的中苏两国的神圣权利。根据一九四五年八月二日波茨坦协定的规定，对日和约应由在日本投降书上签字的中、苏、美、英四国代表组成的外长会议来草拟，并由有关的国家参加。而美国却完全不顾这一庄严的国际协定和它在这一协定上所担承的国际义务，一意孤行，竟单独准备了对日和约草案，蛮横地强迫他国来接受。这是完全非法的，因而也是无效的。中国人民绝不承认这种未经中国参加准备而草拟的对日和约草案。中国对日抗战最久，牺牲最大，牵制的日本陆军最多；苏联于一九四五年八月出兵我国东北，参加对日作战，一举击溃了日本法西斯军队的精锐，是促令日本无条件投降的主要原因，因而中国人民的唯一合法的代表——中华人民共和国中央人民政府和苏联政府必须参加对日和约的准备工作是天经地义的事。中国人民完全拥护苏联政府的提议，即：“在一九五一年六月或七月，召开美、中、英、苏四国代表组织的外长会议，着手筹备对日和约，并应顾及使所有曾以武力参加对日战争之各国代表参与对日和约的筹备工作，以便将和约草案提交和会审议之。”因为这是达成缔结对日全面与公正和约的必要途径。
    开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告，是所有对日作战国家共同对日和约的主要基础。因此，由各国共同参加准备的对日和约草案，必须根据这些国际协定的规定来拟订。然而，美国单独制订的“对日和约草案”不但在程序上是完全非法的，而且在内容上也完全推翻了上述各项国际协定所规定的共同对日和约的基础。开罗宣言曾明确规定，台湾和澎湖列岛应归还中国，并使朝鲜获得自由与独立，而美国“草案”却对于台湾、澎湖列岛的归属问题不提，对朝鲜的自由独立也不加肯定，其用意显然是企图侵占上述中国和朝鲜的神圣领土。更重要的是，美国“草案”完全违背了波茨坦公告中关于肃清日本军国主义势力的规定，而对日本的重新武装不加任何限制，以便扶植日本军国主义的复活，来在亚洲扩大侵略战争。同时，美国也不顾波茨坦协定中关于“吾人无意奴役日本民族或消灭其国家”，以及“依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府后，同盟国占领军当即撤退”的规定，要以“美日安全协定”的形式，使美军长期占领日本，以达到它灭亡日本国家，使日本成为其合法殖民地的目的。此外，美国“草案”的“政治及经济方面的条款”也是毒辣万分。它要单独在日本享受“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，以便无穷尽地压榨与剥削日本人民，并排斥其他国家与日本平等互惠的贸易往来。这将置日本经济于死地。总之，美国“对日和约草案”是一份掠夺殖民地，扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，并独占日本以灭亡日本国家，奴役日本人民的帝国主义的罪恶计划。这是中苏两国人民、亚洲人民和日本人民所绝不能容忍的。因此，中国人民完全拥护苏联政府所提出的，为拟订全面而公正的对日和约所应遵循的原则，即：草拟对日和约的工作应根据开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔达协定进行，并以下列主要目的为指导方针：甲、日本应成为爱好和平的、民主的、独立的国家；乙、应保证日本人民的民主权利，并不得允许以剥夺人民民主权利为目的的，无论是政治的、军事的或军事化的组织之存在，与对意大利和约中所规定者相同；丙、为保证日本军国主义之不复活，在条约内应确定对日本武装力量规模之限制，使此等武装力量不超越自卫之要求。与在对意大利和约中所规定者相同；丁、对日本和平经济之发展，不应加以任何限制；戊、在日本和其他国家的贸易关系上，应取消一切限制。同时，为保证根本消除任何国家在侵略行为上利用日本的阴谋，并确保日本的自由与独立起见，中国人民也完全拥护苏联政府关于日本不得参加旨在反对任何盟国的同盟，以及在对日和约签字后最多不得超过一年自日本撤退一切占领军，外国不得在日本保有军队，以及签约国应共同支持日本加入联合国组织等规定的提议。因为只有这样日本问题才能和平而公正地得到解决，亚洲的和平也因此才能得到重要的保证。
    周恩来外交部长的照会与《苏联关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》，对于美国准备对日单独媾和与重新武装日本的罪恶计划，是一个严重的打击，而对于中苏人民、亚洲人民及日本人民争取缔结全面而公正的对日和约的斗争则给予以无限的鼓舞。中国人民和世界上爱好和平的人民，必须为争取早日完全实现周恩来外长与苏联政府所提出的对日和约的各项公正原则与具体建议而斗争到底，以彻底粉碎美国帝国主义企图利用日本进行扩大侵略战争的一切阴谋。
