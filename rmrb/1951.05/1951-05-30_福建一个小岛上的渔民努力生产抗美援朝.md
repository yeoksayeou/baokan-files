    Fishermen on a Small Island in Fujian Work Hard to Produce and Resist America and Aid Korea

    To the Editor:
    Our Tak窟 Township is located on a small island in Hui'an County, Fujian Province. This island is only about one square mile in size, with a population of about two thousand. There is no arable land on the island, and the residents here rely entirely on seafaring fishing for a living.

    Now, because American imperialism and the Kuomintang remnants occupy Taiwan, maritime transportation cannot be carried out for the time being; all the people on the island are engaged in fishing. Because of the long-term exploitation by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits, the people's lives are very poor, and there is also a lack of fishing tools. In addition to requesting loans from the People's Government to help solve this difficulty, we are thinking of using a low-cost bamboo raft for fishing and mobilizing women to participate in stringing birds, catching fish, catching shrimp, and picking seaweed.

    The cadres on our island are all very enthusiastic about serving the masses. The cadres can also consider and accept the opinions put forward by the masses very well. According to the requirements of the people of the island, the cadres led everyone to repair a ring-island road, which can be used by tricycles. A cooperative was also established on the island. The people on the island are very satisfied with these two things.

    This year on "May Day" Labor Day, the people on the island held a demonstration parade to resist America and aid Korea, and denounced the aggressive crimes of the Japanese invaders. At 7:00 a.m. on June 12, 1939, the Japanese invaders used five warships, under the cover of two aircraft, to transport 500 brutes to invade this small island. The Japanese invaders killed eight people on the island, including Chen Jinhai, and burned 42 ships of various sizes. When people remembered the disasters brought by the Japanese invaders that year, they were very angry at the aggression of American imperialism, and everyone said that they would use their own practical actions of working hard to engage in production to participate in the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

    福建一个小岛上的渔民努力生产抗美援朝编辑同志：
    我们獭窟乡处在福建省惠安县的一个小岛上，这个岛一共只有一方里大小，人口共约二千，岛上没有可耕的土地，这里的居民完全依靠航海捕鱼为生。
    现在因为美帝国主义和国民党残匪占住台湾，海上运输暂时不能干了；全岛的人民都从事捕鱼。因为日寇和国民党匪徒长期压榨，人民生活很穷困，捕鱼工具也很缺乏。我们除一面请求人民政府贷款帮助解决这一困难外，我们正想法用一种成本低廉的竹筏捕鱼，并发动妇女们参加串鸟、捞鱼、捉虾、拾取海菜等劳动。
    咱们岛上的干部，都能很热心地为群众办事。群众提出的意见，干部们也都能很好的考虑接受。根据全岛人民的要求，干部们带领大家修好了一条环岛大马路，可以通行三轮车。岛上还成立了合作社。岛上的人民对这两件事都很满意。
    今年“五一”劳动节，岛上人民举行了抗美援朝示威大游行，并控诉了日寇的侵略罪行。一九三九年六月十二日上午七时，日寇曾用了五艘军舰，在两架飞机掩护下，运来五百个兽兵侵占过这个小岛。日寇共杀死岛上人民陈金海等八名，焚毁大小船只四十二艘。人们想起了当年日寇所带来的灾难，对于美国帝国主义的侵略，都很愤恨，大家都表示要用自己努力搞生产的实际行动，来参加抗美援朝运动。
