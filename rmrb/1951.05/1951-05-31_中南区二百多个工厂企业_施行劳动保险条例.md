　　Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations in February, factories and enterprises in the Central South Region have applied to local labor administrative organs for registration to implement labor insurance. According to incomplete statistics from the Labor Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, as of the end of April, a total of 231 enterprise units in the region had been approved for implementation, with a total of 114,945 employees (workers in the railway, postal and telecommunications, and ordnance industries are registered with the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government in conjunction with the national committees of the respective industrial trade unions, and are therefore not included). The remainder are still under review or are applying successively. The enterprise units that have been approved for implementation have officially implemented the regulations since May 1. Enterprise units that have passed the audit are now being registered with the provincial and municipal federations of trade unions and paying labor insurance funds to the provincial and municipal People's Banks. However, some enterprise units still do not attach importance to implementation, such as the Hankou Shunji Shipping Company, which has not even paid the labor insurance fund for March. In addition, some People's Banks and trade unions have not yet established a payment system, such as the Wuzhou City People's Bank, which has not yet opened an account for the "All-China Federation of Trade Unions," thereby affecting the payment of labor insurance funds.

　　中南区二百多个工厂企业
    施行劳动保险条例
    中南区自二月间中央人民政府政务院公布劳动保险条例后，各地工矿企业单位纷纷向当地劳动行政机关申请登记实行劳动保险。根据中南军政委员会劳动部不完全的统计，全区至四月底批准实行的企业单位共计有二百三十一个，职工人数为十一万四千九百四十五人（铁路、邮电、兵工三产业系统的工人由中央人民政府铁道部、邮电部、重工业部会同各产业工会全国委员会向中央人民政府劳动部登记，故不包括在内），其余还在审核和陆续申请中。经批准实行的企业单位，自五月一日起已正式执行。经审核合格的企业单位，现正向各地省、市总工会备案，并向省、市人民银行缴纳劳动保险基金。但仍有些企业单位不重视执行，如汉口顺记轮船公司连三月份的劳动保险基金都没缴。另外，也有些人民银行与工会尚未建立缴款制度，如梧州市人民银行，还没有开“中华全国总工会户”的户头，以致影响劳动保险金的缴纳。
