Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 21st: The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published an editorial on May 21st titled "America's Sinister Policy of Expanding War," commenting on the US aggressors' repeated use of the United Nations' voting machinery to pass a resolution on embargoing goods to the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "Spark" emphasized: This shameless resolution aims to indefinitely hinder the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and increasingly expand aggression against the People's Republic of China. Recently, the barbarous desire of American tycoons to attack the People's Republic of China has been openly revealed. For two weeks, the US Senate, in the so-called debate on foreign policy, has become a forum for madly provocative speeches advocating open war against the people of China. The American imperialists, who were defeated along with their Kuomintang agents, have invaded Korea again, attempting to turn it into a passage for re-invading China. However, the heroic spirit of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers has shattered this attempt. Korea has not been conquered and cannot be conquered. Despite MacArthur and Truman's fantasies, the weapon of economic blockade cannot subdue the great Chinese people. American imperialists have been imposing blockades on the people's democratic countries for many years. However, with the aid of the great Soviet Union, the people of these countries have not only not been destroyed by hunger, as American merchants hoped and as Marshallized countries have indeed experienced, but our countries are constantly developing and prospering. The American imperialists and their lackeys have been implementing a policy of economic blockade against China and North Korea for a long time, but this policy has not been able to save the American aggressors from defeat in Korea.

"Spark" wrote: The strength of the people's democratic regimes and the peace camp led by the Soviet Union is united, which the imperialist camp does not have and cannot have. "Spark," in recalling the American imperialists' use of the already tainted UN flag to cover up their new crimes, wrote: The United Nations has once again proven that it has betrayed its original purpose of establishment. It is no longer a world organization of peoples but has become an American organization and a tool of war in the hands of bloodthirsty tycoons. The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly is another important step on the road of war preparation by imperialist warmongers. This sinister act is related to a series of other recent events, which shows that the aggression of American imperialism is intensifying.

The editorial believes: The war frenzy of the American imperialists does not prove that they are strong; on the contrary, it proves that they fear the growing forces of peace. The epoch-making victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction, the achievements of the People's Republic of China and the People's Democracies, and the strength generated by the friendship and alliance between these countries and the Soviet Union are all powerful obstacles in the path of imperialist aggressors. "Spark" concluded: The people of the world are firmly opposed to the organizers of another great massacre, are taking the cause of safeguarding peace into their own hands, and will defend it to the end.

　　联大非法通过对我禁运案
    证明美国正在扩大侵略
    罗火花报指斥美国罪恶政策
    【新华社讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十一日讯：《火花报》二十一日发表题为《美国扩大战争的罪恶政策》的社论，评论美国侵略者再度以联合国组织的表决机器通过关于禁运物资至中华人民共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的决议。《火花报》强调说：这个无耻的决议，其目的在于无限期地阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，以及日益扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略。最近，美国大富翁们想进攻中华人民共和国的野蛮欲望已经明目张胆地公开出来了。两星期来，美国参议院在所谓外交政策的辩论中，已变成主张公开对人民中国作战的疯狂的挑拨性言论的讲坛。曾经与他们的国民党代理人一同被战败的美帝国主义者，又来侵略朝鲜，企图把它变成再度侵入中国的通路。然而，朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军的英勇气概，已经把他们这种企图粉碎了。朝鲜没有被征服，也不能被征服。尽管麦克阿瑟和杜鲁门抱着幻想，但是经济封锁的武器更不能使伟大的中国人民屈服。美帝国主义者对人民民主国家实行封锁已经多年了。但是，得到了伟大的苏联的援助的这些国家的人民，不仅没有遭到毁灭与饥饿，像美国商人所希望的和马歇尔化国家确已遭遇的那样，而且我们的国家却在不断地发展和繁荣着。美帝国主义者和他们的仆从们对中朝两国实行经济封锁的政策已经很久了，然而，这种政策并未能够使美国侵略者在朝鲜免于失败。
    《火花报》写道：人民民主政权和以苏联为首的和平阵营团结的力量，是帝国主义阵营所没有，也不可能有的。《火花报》在追述美帝国主义者用早已被沾污了的联合国旗帜来掩盖他们的新罪行时，写道：联合国又一次地证明：它背叛了缔造它的时候的原来宗旨，它已不再是各国人民的世界组织，而已经变成美国人的组织以及嗜杀成性的豪门巨富手中的战争工具。联合国大会的决议是贩卖战争的帝国主义者备战道路上的又一重要步骤。这个罪恶的行为是和最近发生的一连串其他事实有关的，它说明了美帝国主义者的侵略正在加紧。
    社论认为：美帝国主义者的战争狂并不能证明他们是强有力的，相反地，证明了他们惧怕不断增长的和平力量。苏联和平建设的划时代胜利、中华人民共和国和人民民主国爱的成就、这些国家与苏联间的友谊和联盟所产生的力量，都是帝国主义侵略者路上的强大障碍。《火花报》在结语中说：全世界人民都正在坚决地反对另一次大屠杀的组织者，正在把维护和平的事业掌握在自己的手里，并把它保卫到底。
