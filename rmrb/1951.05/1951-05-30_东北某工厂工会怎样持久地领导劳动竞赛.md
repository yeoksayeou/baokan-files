How a Factory Union in Northeast China Persistently Leads Labor Emulation
Northeast Federation of Trade Unions Production Department

The union and the administration should work together from two aspects to do one thing well

The union of a factory in Northeast China has led all workers and staff to conduct regular labor emulation, from the new record movement in October 1949 until now. The main reason for being able to do this is that the union and the administration can cooperate closely and do one thing well from two aspects. In each period, the administration puts forward different production tasks, and the union closely follows up by studying the plan, mobilizing the masses, and ensuring its completion.

In the first quarter of last year, the central task of the factory's administration was to formulate various quotas. At that time, the main problem in production was the unbalanced development of new records, with a large difference between the output of advanced producers and the general average output. For example, Yang Guizhong's daily output reached 117 pieces, and the average for the whole group was 85 pieces per person. After standardization, the quota was set at 90 pieces. The workers did not approve this after discussion, creating difficulties in setting the quota. The union studied the situation at the time and believed that to ensure the smooth completion of the quota work, it was necessary to enable the advanced to lead the backward and to promote the individual new record to the whole group's new record. The key to doing this was to implement technical mutual assistance in the group. To this end, the union studied the experience of Zhao Enbo's advanced group. Zhao Enbo was the union group leader of the fitter model group. When the task was heavy in November and December last year, he led the group to launch a democratic discussion, formulate a plan for the group to collectively complete the task, assign tasks according to expertise, implement technical mutual assistance, and formulate a group collective agreement. As a result, they not only completed the task but also exceeded it, improved the quality, and the whole group created a collective new record. The union seized this group's experience and promoted it throughout the factory, calling on all workshops and groups to learn from the experience of Zhao Enbo's group and launch a group collective agreement movement. Due to the signing of collective agreements by each group, the unity between workers and staff (especially the unity between workers and technical personnel) was promoted, and the advanced led the intermediate and backward, and production was generally improved. For example, after the implementation of the agreement by Yang Guizhong's group, the average output increased by 28.5 percent; after the implementation of the agreement by Bi Yulan's group, the output increased by 26 percent compared with before. Therefore, it powerfully guaranteed the smooth completion of the quota work of the basic production unit.

In the second quarter, in order to consolidate the quotas, the administration proposed to improve business management, formulate scientific management systems, and enable the management departments to keep up with the requirements of production. The union, focusing on this central task and requirements, took the initiative to consult with the administration and relevant departments, and mobilized all employees to sign collective contracts and liaison contracts with the administration to ensure the completion and exceeding of the quotas. As a result, the tasks stipulated in the contract were exceeded, and the connection between the departments was promoted.

Unite technical personnel and staff to participate in the competition, and combine labor with technology

The mass labor emulation in a factory, from the new record movement to the present, has completely avoided the phenomenon of pure physical competition and overtime work. The main reason is to unite and mobilize technical personnel and staff to participate in the movement, and to combine labor with technology and theory with practice. For example, after the technician Lan Yunwen successfully transformed a machine, he took it to the manufacturing section for manufacturing. The old worker Zhao Baidong made suggestions for modification, but Lan did not accept them, and the result was that it was not easy to use. Later, it was still modified according to Zhao's opinion before it was successful. Before the machine was改造 (transformed), it was difficult to repair and use because there were too many parts. Zhao Baidong and Ren Shanglian had studied it several times and were prepared to modify it, but it did not work because they could not design it. After the technician Lan Yunwen改造 (transformed) it, it was both easy to use and easy to repair. Therefore, Zhao Baidong and Ren Shanglian said admiringly: "The technician's brain is really not simple!" At the award ceremony, technician Lan Yunwen reviewed his past erroneous thinking of belittling workers; old worker Zhao Baidong also reviewed his mistake of relying solely on practical experience and not believing in technical theory. The union seized this example and carried out repeated discussions and education among all employees. Since then, the unity between workers and technical personnel and staff has been strengthened. Now, whenever the technicians of the technology section design a machine drawing, they first hold a forum with old workers in the manufacturing department and the user department to fully solicit the opinions of the workers. This reduces a lot of man-hours and material waste and improves the quality.

Establish an inspection and reward system, and summarize in a timely manner

The characteristic of the factory's leadership movement is "don't lose the old when engaging in the new." For example, in the first quarter of last year, group collective agreements were generally established in each workshop, section, and group. Its content initially included the production quantity, quality, labor discipline, etc. of each person in the group for one day and one month. When engaging in liaison contracts and collective contracts in the second quarter, systems such as machine maintenance, safety, and confidentiality were enriched. During the model group competition in the third quarter, the special responsibility system was added to the content. In the fourth quarter, due to the large increase in new workers, the group agreement added technical learning (which existed before, but was not included in the agreement), handover system and responsibility checklist. These systems are based on a conscious and voluntary basis, so the workers abide by them automatically. At the same time, after these systems were established, they were conscientiously checked and implemented. For example, the factory union went to each workshop and group for inspection and spot checks once every half month; the workshop committee inspected and judged once a week, and the results of the inspection and judgment were announced in a timely manner; the group inspected every day and at any time. Each group also set up a production target board, which marked the group's daily planned output, quality, and the quantity and quality completed on the day. This production board has three advantages: first, it makes every worker remember and understand the production situation of the group for one day. Second, the group leader can grasp the daily production situation and have solid evidence to check the group's work. Third, it enables the leading cadres of the workshop to know the daily production volume of each group in order to grasp the balance of production. This kind of inspection has become a system. Therefore, the group collective agreement established last spring has been adhered to until now and has become a regular system.

In the movement, cadres go deep into the grassroots, inspecting the movement situation on the one hand, and summarizing typical experiences on the other hand, rewarding and commending the good ones in a timely manner, and criticizing the bad ones. And they often use the method of exchanging experiences, such as running short-term training classes for union group leaders, etc., to universally promote advanced experiences. Therefore, from cadres to workers, they all understand what kind of practice is right and what kind of practice is wrong. The resulting deviations are quickly corrected, so that the movement maintains normal development.

　　东北某工厂工会怎样持久地领导劳动竞赛
    东北总工会生产部
    工会行政从两个方面去做好一件事情
    东北某工厂工会领导全厂工人和职员，从一九四九年十月的新纪录运动直到现在，进行了经常性的劳动竞赛。能够做到这样，主要原因是工会与行政方面能紧密配合，从两方面做好一件事情。每个时期行政方面提出不同的生产任务，工会就紧跟着研究计划，发动群众，保证完成。
    去年第一季度该厂行政方面的中心工作是制定各种定额。当时生产中的主要问题是新纪录发展不平衡，先进生产者与一般的平均产量相差悬殊。如杨贵忠每日产量达到一百十七件，全组平均每人达到八十五件；标定后，定额为九十件；经工人讨论没通过，给定额造成了困难。工会研究当时的情况，认为：要保证定额工作顺利完成，必须使先进的带动落后的，把个人的新纪录推广为全组新纪录。这样做的关键在于在小组里实行技术互助。为此，工会研究了赵恩波先进小组的经验。赵恩波是钳工样板组的工会小组长，在去年十一、十二两月任务繁重时，他领导小组展开民主讨论，订出小组集体完成任务的计划，按特长分工，实行技术互助，订出小组集体公约。结果，不但完成任务，而且超过任务，提高了质量，全组创造了集体新纪录。工会抓住这一小组的经验推广到全厂，号召各车间、小组学习赵恩波小组经验，展开小组集体公约运动。由于各小组集体公约的签订，促进了工人、职员之间的团结（特别是工人与技术人员之间的团结），使先进的把中间和落后的带动起来了，生产普遍提高。如杨贵忠小组实行公约后，产量平均提高百分之二十八点五；毕玉兰小组实行公约后，产量比以前提高百分之二十六。因此，有力地保证了基本生产单位定额工作的顺利完成。
    第二季度行政方面为了巩固定额，提出改善经营管理，制订科学的管理制度，使管理部门跟上生产的要求。工会围绕着这一中心任务与要求，主动与行政方面及有关部门商量，发动全体职工与行政方面签订了集体合同和联系合同，来保证定额的完成与超过。结果超过了合同规定的任务，促进了各科之间的联系。
    团结技术人员、职员参加竞赛，做到劳动与技术结合
    某工厂的群众劳动竞赛，从新纪录运动坚持到现在，完全避免了单纯的体力比赛和加班加点现象，主要是团结与发动技术人员与职员参加运动，做到了劳动与技术、理论与实际相结合。如技术员蓝允文改造机器成功后，拿到制造科去制造，老工友赵百东提出修改意见，蓝未接受，结果做成不好使。以后仍按赵的意见修改了才成功。此机器未改造前，因零件多，不好修，不好使。赵百东和任尚连曾研究过好几次，准备修改，因不会设计未成。经技术员蓝允文改造后，既好使又好修。因此，赵百东与任尚连佩服地说：“技术员脑筋真不简单啊！”技术员蓝允文在发奖大会上检讨了过去轻视工人的错误思想；老工友赵百东也检讨了光靠实际经验不相信技术理论的错误。工会抓住这个实例，在全体职工中进行了反复的讨论教育。从此加强了工人与技术人员、职员之间的团结。现在技术科的技术员们每逢设计一种机器图纸，都事先到制造部门与使用部门召开一下老工人座谈会，充分征求工人的意见。这样就减免了很多工时与材料的浪费，提高了质量。
  建立检查奖励制度，及时总结
    该厂领导运动的特点是“搞新不丢旧”。如去年第一季度，各车间、科股、小组普遍地建立了小组集体公约，它的内容开始包括全组每个人一天一月的生产数量、质量、劳动纪律等。在第二季度搞联系合同与集体合同时，充实了机器保修、安全、保密等制度。在第三季度的模范小组竞赛时，在内容上又增加了专责制。第四季度中由于新的工人大量增加，小组公约又增添了技术学习（以前也有，但未订到公约里边去），交接班制度和责任检查表。这些制度是建筑在自觉自愿的基础上的，因此，工人都自动地遵守。同时这些制度建立后，又认真地检查执行，如厂工会半月去各车间、小组检查与抽查一次；车间委员会每一星期检查评判一次，将检查评判结果及时公布出来；小组则每天检查和随时检查。在各组还设了生产指标牌，上面标明小组每日计划产量、质量，当日完成数量、质量。这种生产牌有三个好处：第一，使每个工友都记得和了解本组一天生产情况。第二，组长能掌握每天的生产情况，有了检查本组工作的真凭实据。第三，使车间领导干部知道了各组的每天生产量，以便掌握生产上的平衡。这种检查已成为制度。因此，去年春天建立的小组集体公约一直坚持到现在，已成为一种经常的制度了。
    在运动中，干部深入下层，一面检查运动情况，一面总结典型经验，好的及时奖励、表扬，坏的进行批评。并经常利用交流经验的方式，如开办了工会小组长短期训练班等，把先进经验普遍推广出去。因此，从干部到工人的思想上都明白了那一种做法是对的，那一种做法是错误的，产生的偏向很快便被纠正了，使运动保持了正常的发展。
