People's opera is an important weapon for educating the broad masses of the people with democratic and patriotic spirit. China's opera heritage is extremely rich and closely related to the people. It is essential to inherit this heritage and carry it forward. However, many parts of this heritage were used by feudal rulers as tools to numb and poison the people. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between good and bad, make choices, and transform and develop it on a new basis in order to conform to the interests of the country and the people.

Over the past year, significant progress has been made in opera reform in various regions. New operas have emerged in large numbers and have been welcomed by the broad masses of the people. Many artists have learned new knowledge and new viewpoints and have become the backbone of the opera reform movement. However, there are also some shortcomings in the work, the most important of which are the lack of unified standards for reviewing repertoires and certain anti-historical and formulaic tendencies in the work of compiling and adapting scripts. The National Opera Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government in November 1950 reviewed the opera reform work in various regions and put forward the guiding principles for future work. After listening to the report of the Ministry of Culture on this conference, the State Council of the Central People's Government hereby issues the following instructions:

1.  Opera should take the promotion of the people's new patriotic spirit and the encouragement of the people's heroism in revolutionary struggles and productive labor as its primary task. Operas that promote resistance to aggression, resistance to oppression, love for the motherland, love for freedom, love for labor, and praise the people's justice and their good character should be encouraged and promoted. Conversely, operas that promote feudal slave morality, promote barbaric terror or obscene and poisonous behavior, and uglify and insult the working people should be opposed. Local cultural and educational organs must be responsible for reviewing the performed repertoires based on the above standards, and should not let things drift, but should adopt a positive reform policy. The reform should mainly rely on the concerted efforts of the broad masses of artists, rely on them to jointly examine, revise and write scripts, and rely on newspapers and periodicals to appropriately展开戏曲批评. In general, administrative orders and bans should not be relied upon. Operas that have important poisoning effects on the people must be banned, and should be handled uniformly by the Central Ministry of Culture. Local authorities shall not ban them without authorization.

2.  At present, the main force of opera reform work should be to review the most popular old repertoires, and make necessary and appropriate revisions to the bad content and bad performance methods. It is necessary to eliminate ideological content with significant poisoning effects, and in terms of performance methods, remove all barbaric, terrifying, obscene, slavish, insulting to one's own nation, and anti-patriotic elements. Good repertoires, whether old or revised, should be affirmed as traditional national repertoires, and all healthy, progressive, and beautiful elements in them should continue to be carried forward. When revising old scripts, attention should be paid not to violate historical truth and the effect of education on the people.

Opera reform is a serious task in reforming the old social and cultural undertakings, and will inevitably encounter many complex problems. Therefore, opera reform work must be carried out step by step. Generally speaking, it should start with the scope that is easiest to start with and easiest to obtain the consent of the majority of artists, and then gradually promote it. It is necessary to prevent the impatient emotions in opera reform work, and the crude methods resulting therefrom.

3.  Chinese opera has an extremely rich variety, and should be universally adopted, transformed and developed. Encourage the free competition of various opera forms and promote the "blooming of a hundred flowers" in opera art. Local operas, especially folk operas, have simpler and more lively forms, are easy to reflect modern life, and are also easy for the masses to accept, and should be given special attention. In the future, the work of improving opera in various regions should focus on the types of opera that have the greatest impact on the local masses as the main objects of reform and development. To this end, we should widely collect, record, and publish new and old scripts of local operas and folk operas for research and improvement. Where possible, a national opera competition and performance should be held once a year to display the achievements of the improvement of various opera types, and reward their excellent works and performances to guide their development.

Chinese folk art forms, such as big drum and storytelling, are simple and expressive, and are extremely convenient for quickly reflecting reality, and should be valued. In addition to creating a large number of new folk art lyrics, the singing books of many historical stories and beautiful folk tales familiar to the people should also be transformed and adopted.

4.  Opera artists bear a major responsibility in the cause of entertaining and educating the people, and should strengthen their studies in politics, culture and business to improve themselves. Local cultural and educational organs should conscientiously conduct artist education and pay attention to cultivating cadres for opera reform work from among the artists. For old mobile professional opera troupes in rural areas that cannot be trained centrally, opera reform work cadres can be sent to various troupes to conduct education in rotation, and help them rehearse new repertoires according to possibility and need.

New literary and art workers should actively participate in the work of opera reform, learn from each other, cooperate closely with opera artists, and jointly revise and write scripts, and improve opera music and stage art.

5.  Some unreasonable systems in the old opera troupes, such as the old apprenticeship system, the adopted daughter system, and the "Jing Li Ke" system, seriously infringe on human rights and the welfare of artists, and should be reformed step by step. This reform must mainly rely on the conscious willingness of the masses of artists.

6.  Opera work should be led uniformly by the local cultural and educational authorities. Each province and city should, on the basis of the better-conditioned old theater troupes and theaters, establish demonstration theater troupes and theaters under the principle of enterprise, adopting the methods of public ownership, joint public-private ownership, or private ownership with public assistance, and perform new repertoires in a planned and regular manner, improve theater management, and serve as a base for promoting the reform of local opera work.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于戏曲改革工作的指示
    人民戏曲是以民主精神与爱国精神教育广大人民的重要武器。我国戏曲遗产极为丰富，和人民有密切的联系，继承这种遗产，加以发扬光大，是十分必要的。但这种遗产中许多部分曾被封建统治者用作麻醉毒害人民的工具，因此必须分别好坏加以取舍，并在新的基础上加以改造、发展，才能符合国家与人民的利益。
    一年多以来，各地戏曲改革工作已获得显著成绩。新戏曲已大量出现，并受到了广大群众的欢迎；许多艺人学得了新的知识与新的观点，成为戏曲改革运动的骨干。但在工作中亦存在若干缺点，最主要的是审定剧目缺乏统一标准，与编改剧本工作中还有某些反历史主义的、公式主义的倾向。中央人民政府文化部在一九五○年十一月所召集的全国戏曲工作会议，检讨了各地戏曲改革工作的情况，并提出了今后工作的方针。政务院在听取文化部关于这一会议的报告以后，特作如下指示：
    一、戏曲应以发扬人民新的爱国主义精神，鼓舞人民在革命斗争与生产劳动中的英雄主义为首要任务。凡宣传反抗侵略、反抗压迫、爱祖国、爱自由、爱劳动、表扬人民正义及其善良性格的戏曲应予以鼓励和推广，反之，凡鼓吹封建奴隶道德、鼓吹野蛮恐怖或猥亵淫毒行为、丑化与侮辱劳动人民的戏曲应加以反对。各地文教机关必须根据上述标准对上演剧目负责进行审查，不应放任自流，而应采取积极改革的方针。进行改革主要地应当依靠广大艺人的通力合作，依靠他们共同审定、修改与编写剧本，并依靠报纸刊物适当地展开戏曲批评，一般地不应当依靠行政命令与禁演的办法。对人民有重要毒害的戏曲必须禁演者，应由中央文化部统一处理，各地不得擅自禁演。
    二、目前戏曲改革工作应以主要力量审定流行最广的旧有剧目，对其中的不良内容和不良表演方法进行必要的和适当的修改。必须革除有重要毒害的思想内容，并应在表演方法上，删除各种野蛮的、恐怖的、猥亵的、奴化的、侮辱自己民族的、反爱国主义的成份。对旧有的或经过修改的好的剧目，应作为民族传统的剧目加以肯定，并继续发扬其中一切健康、进步、美丽的因素。在修改旧有剧本时，应注意不违背历史的真实与对人民的教育的效果。
    戏曲改革是改革旧有社会文化事业中的一项严重任务，不可避免地将要遭遇许多复杂的问题，因此，戏曲改革工作必须有步骤地进行。一般地说，应当由最容易着手和最容易获得多数艺人同意的范围开始，然后逐步推广。必须防止在戏曲改革工作上的急躁情绪，和由此而来的粗暴手段。
    三、中国戏曲种类极为丰富，应普遍地加以采用、改造与发展，鼓励各种戏曲形式的自由竞赛，促成戏曲艺术的“百花齐放”。地方戏尤其是民间小戏，形式较简单活泼，容易反映现代生活，并且也容易为群众接受，应特别加以重视。今后各地戏曲改进工作应以对当地群众影响最大的剧种为主要改革与发展对象。为此，应广泛搜集、纪录、刊行地方戏、民间小戏的新旧剧本，以供研究改进。在可能条件下，每年应举行全国戏曲竞赛公演一次，展览各剧种改进成绩，奖励其优秀作品与演出，以指导其发展。
    中国曲艺形式，如大鼓、说书等，简单而又富于表现力，极便于迅速反映现实，应当予以重视。除应大量创作曲艺新词外，对许多为人民所熟悉的历史故事与优美的民间传说的唱本，亦应加以改造采用。
    四、戏曲艺人在娱乐与教育人民的事业上负有重大责任，应在政治、文化及业务上加强学习，提高自己。各地文教机关应认真地举办艺人教育并注意从艺人中培养戏曲改革工作的干部。农村中流动的职业旧戏班社，不能集中训练者，可派戏曲改革工作干部至各班社轮流进行教育，并按照可能与需要帮助其排演新剧目。
    新文艺工作者应积极参加戏曲改革的工作，与戏曲艺人互相学习、密切合作，共同修改与编写剧本、改进戏曲音乐与舞台艺术。
    五、旧戏班社中的某些不合理制度，如旧徒弟制、养女制、“经励科”制度等，严重地侵害人权与艺人福利，应有步骤地加以改革，这种改革必须主要依靠艺人群众的自觉自愿。
    六、戏曲工作应统一由各地文教主管机关领导。各省市应以条件较好的旧有剧团、剧场为基础，在企业化的原则下，采取公营、公私合营或私营公助的方式，建立示范性的剧团、剧场，有计划地、经常地演出新剧目，改进剧场管理，作为推进当地戏曲改革工作的据点。
