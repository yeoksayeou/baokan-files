Losing a Livestock Animal is Equal to Losing Half the Family Fortune; Hoping the Government Helps Farmers Raise Livestock Well

To the Editor:

Wang Jiuchang, from Nanmujing Village, Twelfth District, Lin County, Pingyuan Province, had a good mule die recently from a sudden illness. This mule was only two years old (one pair of teeth), and its local market value would be over 3,800 catties of millet. For a small farmer, this is equivalent to losing half of his family's wealth. You can imagine how heartbroken he must be! Seeing this incident, I had to pick up my pen and write this letter. I hope that the people's governments in all regions will help farmers raise their livestock well, such as organizing medical teams to go to the countryside to conduct regular or irregular inspections, administer vaccinations, and teach farmers scientific knowledge about raising livestock. We farmers ourselves must also pay attention to maintaining our livestock and share our experiences with each other.

    死个牲口等于丧失半个家业  希望政府帮助农民养好牲口编辑同志：
    平原省林县十二区南木井村王九昌喂的一条好骡子，最近忽然得病死了。这个骡子今年才一对牙，当地市价要值小米三千八百多斤。对一个小农户来说，这等于丧失了半个家业，你想，怎能不叫人伤心流泪呢？见了这件事，我就不得不动笔写起这封信来。我希望各地人民政府，要帮助农民养好牲口，如组织医疗队下乡，进行定期或不定期的检查。注射预防针，并把养牲口的科学常识教给农民。我们农民自己也要注意保养牲口，互相介绍经验。
