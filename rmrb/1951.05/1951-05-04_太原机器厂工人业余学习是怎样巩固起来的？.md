　　How Did the Taiyuan Machine Factory Consolidate Workers' Spare-Time Learning?
       Gao Xuelan
    The opening of a spare-time school does not mean that everything is perfect, because workers, on the one hand, have to engage in production, and on the other hand, have to deal with family affairs, so their learning enthusiasm often cannot be stabilized. Therefore, the leadership of spare-time learning should not be relaxed, but should further enhance and encourage the workers' learning enthusiasm, so that learning enters a regular state.

  Grasping the Ideological Situation of Teachers and Students
    Teachers and students are busy with production every day and often regard other work as a burden, so their ideological situation is constantly changing. If the teacher's work is slack, it will immediately affect the entire class's learning enthusiasm. Worker-teacher Wang Zhu was embarrassed to ask the master craftsmen to wipe the blackboard because he was an apprentice. Therefore, the school proposed that the relationship during work hours is that of master and apprentice, and the relationship during school hours is that of teacher and student, dispelling the relationship of face that hindered learning.

  Everyone Should Take Care of Everyone's Affairs
    After the opening of the spare-time school, absenteeism was frequently discovered. After understanding the situation and studying it, we relied on activists to lead the students to formulate attendance and other systems. Learning mutual aid groups also guaranteed to implement the systems. The teachers also formulated a system of rotating inspections and observations, so that learning became regularized. This shows that the masses can come up with ideas to do a good job in spare-time school work. For example, the three-shift learning method was not good, so everyone discussed and formulated a transfer system to overcome this shortcoming. Taking attendance in class wasted time, so everyone came up with a system of reports by mutual aid group leaders, which was controlled by the class leader, saving time and strengthening the mass responsibility system. When it was discovered that worker Wang Dingzhong had been absent for two consecutive days, the teacher's persuasion was ineffective, so all the students in the class automatically wrote him a letter, patiently advising him: "All the students in the class are working hard to learn, only you are absent, which destroys everyone's system." Wang Dingzhong was moved and made a guarantee to everyone. Worker Liu Ding'an was also frequently absent and his academic performance was not good. Some people thought that there was no way to educate him, but with the help of the learning mutual aid group, he confessed his mistakes to everyone and also guaranteed that he would not be absent again. With the help of classmate Hu Yunhua, his learning has made great progress.

  Strengthen Extracurricular Review
    To consolidate spare-time school learning, there must be good teaching methods and sound organizational leadership. If the teacher only focuses on lecturing and does not grasp the characteristics of adults, the students will experience the phenomenon of listening in class and forgetting after class, falling behind the learning progress, and their enthusiasm will decline. Therefore, the machine factory pays special attention to extracurricular tutoring and implements a homework submission method. But it is difficult to implement this. Some workers neither buy notebooks nor submit homework; no matter how many times the teacher asks him to submit it, he always prevaricates. Later, the teacher proposed a method of exchanging and grading papers with each other, which the workers called "finding a partner"; if there was no homework, others would not exchange with him. This method stimulated Yue Guanyi, who did not submit homework. He said: "It's really embarrassing, if you don't have homework, you can't find a partner. Next time, I must study hard and do a good job on my homework." We used this method to overcome the problem of not submitting homework, strengthened extracurricular tutoring, improved the workers' learning confidence, and gave play to the role of little teachers.

  Full-time Teachers Should Play a Core Role
    In relatively large-scale spare-time schools, relying solely on a few full-time teachers to teach cannot solve the problem. Part-time teachers are an indispensable force. But full-time teachers must play a core role. After specific division of labor, they must go deep into the workshops, understand and grasp the learning situation in a timely manner, and frequently contact part-time teachers and learn from each other. When part-time teachers are teaching, full-time teachers can take time to visit and guide, put forward issues that should be paid attention to in teaching, correct deviations, and help prepare lessons. This is an important link in uniting all teachers and consolidating spare-time schools.

    Cultivating Backbone Elements
    Workers often say that there should be a model for work. In learning, we must also find models and patiently cultivate backbone elements in learning, so that they can establish prestige among the masses and serve as a direction for everyone's hard work. The spare-time school used this method to cultivate model branches, model classes, and mutual aid groups. He also cultivated Comrade Han Linquan, a 57-year-old illiterate. He learned eight hundred characters in half a year. This dispelled the idea of ​​old workers who thought, "Alas, this old man can't learn anymore."

    Do a Good Job in Propaganda and Mobilization
    Learning should be gradually improved, and different slogans should be put forward according to the specific situation. When starting to learn, the masses are willing to try and see if they can gain anything. At this time, we announced everyone's achievements in "Everyone's Talk" and "Red Bulletin Board," which encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. Then they wanted to try writing letters, writing articles, and even composing quick-clapper rhymes. The spare-time school organized students to broadcast on the radio, listen to recordings, and launch a "write a letter" campaign; at the same time, it also published workers' works. When the workers saw their works published in the newspaper, their learning enthusiasm became even higher.

    On this basis, we launched a learning competition between individuals, between mutual aid groups, between classes and classes, and between branches and branches, setting off a learning upsurge and advancing learning a step further.

　　太原机器厂工人业余学习是怎样巩固起来的？
       高学兰
    业余学校开课以后，不能算是万事大吉，因为工人一方面要从事生产，另一方面又要应付家里的事，学习情绪常常不能稳定下来。所以对业余学习的领导，不但不能放松，而且应更进一步的提高和鼓舞工人的学习情绪，使学习步入正规。
  掌握教员与学员的思想情况
    教员和学员每天忙于生产，对于其他工作往往认为是负担，因此，他们的思想情况经常不断地变化着。如果教员的工作松懈，马上就会影响全班的学习情绪。工人教员王竹，因自己是个学徒，不好意思教老师傅抹黑板。于是学校就提出上工时是师徒关系，上学时是师生关系，打消了阻碍学习的情面关系。
  大家的事要大家办
    业余学校开学后，经常发现旷课现象。了解了情况并加以研究以后，我们依靠积极分子带动学员，订立考勤等各种制度，学习互助组也互相保证执行制度，教员们也订出轮流检查与观摩制，使学习走上了正规。这说明了群众能够自己出主意，办好业余学校工作。又如三班倒的学习方式不好，大家就讨论订出转学制度，克服了这个缺点。上课点名浪费时间，大家又想出了互助组长报告制度，由班长来掌握，节省了时间又加强了群众负责制。发现工友王鼎钟接连旷课两天，教员说服无效，全班学员便自动联名写信给他，耐心地劝告他说：“全班同学都努力学习，只有你旷课，破坏了大家的制度。”王鼎钟被感动了，向大家作了保证。工友刘定安也经常旷课，学习成绩又不好。有的人认为没法把他教育过来，但经过学习互助组的帮助，他向大家检讨了自己的错误，也保证以后不再旷课。在胡云华同学的帮助下，他的学习有了很大的进步。
  加强课外复习
    要巩固业余学校学习，必须有好的教学法和健全的组织领导。如果教员只顾讲而不去掌握成年人的特点，学生就会发生上课听下课忘的现象，跟不上学习进度，情绪低落下去。因此，机器厂特别注意课外补习，实行交作业的办法。但执行起来是会遇到困难的，有些工友既不买笔记本，又不交作业；教员再三地要他交，他总是推诿。后来教员就提出互相交换互相批卷的方式，工友叫作“找对象”；没有作业，别人就不和他交换。这种办法，刺激了不交作业的岳贯一，他说：“真丢人，没有作业就找不着对象，下次我一定要好好学习，搞好作业。”我们就用这个办法克服了不交作业的毛病，加强了课外补习，提高了工友们的学习信心，发挥了小先生的作用。
  专任教员要起核心作用
    在规模比较大的业余学校里，单靠少数几个专任教员教课是解决不了问题的。兼任教员是不可缺少的力量。但专任教员必须起核心作用，经过具体分工以后，要深入车间，及时地了解和掌握学习情况，经常地与兼任教员联系，互相学习。兼任教员上课时，专任教员可抽时间去参观指导，提出教学中应注意的问题，纠正偏向，帮助准备功课。这是团结全体教员巩固业余学校的一个重要环节。
    培养骨干分子
    工人们常说干活要有样板。在学习中也要找样板，耐心地培养学习中的骨干分子，使他在群众中建立威信，作为大家努力学习的方向。业余学校利用这个方法，培养了模范分校、模范班与互助组。还培养了五十七岁的老文盲韩林泉同志。他在半年内识了八百字。这样就打消了老工人“唉，咱这老汉再学也不行了”的思想。
    作好宣传鼓动工作
    学习应该是逐步提高，并根据具体情况，提出不同的口号。开始学习时，群众都愿意试试，看自己到底有没有收获。这时，我们就在“大家谈”“红布报”上公布了大家的成绩，鼓励了大家的情绪。接着他们又想试试写信、写稿，甚至编快板。业余学校就组织学员上电台广播，收听记录，发动写一封信运动；同时又发表了工人的作品。工人们看到自己的作品登了报，学习热情更加高涨了。
    在这个基础上，我们又发动个人之间、互助组之间、班与班，分校与分校的学习竞赛，掀起了学习高潮，把学习推进了一步。
