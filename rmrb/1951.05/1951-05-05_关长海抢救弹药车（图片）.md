    (X) Then, Guan Changhai ran to the locomotive and said to the driver, "Let's go rescue Locomotive No. 101!" This locomotive was less than ten meters away from the exploding carriages and was about to be damaged by the exploding bullets and shells.
    (XI) Being less than ten meters away from the exploding carriages was indeed very dangerous. Guan Changhai took off his overcoat and encouraged the driver, "Comrade, take my leather coat and wrap it around your head, and follow me!"
    (XII) Guan Changhai jumped onto Locomotive No. 101. This heroic action moved Qin Deshan. He said to Liu Fengqi, "Look at Old Guan! He's not afraid, what are we afraid of?!" So, they braved the smoke and fire and jumped onto the locomotive.
