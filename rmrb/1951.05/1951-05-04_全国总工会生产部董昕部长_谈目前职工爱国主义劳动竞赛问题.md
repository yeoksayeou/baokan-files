Minister Dong Xin of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Discusses the Current Issue of Patriotic Labor Emulation Among Workers
    Minister Dong Xin of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions answered questions from a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the current patriotic labor emulation campaign among workers nationwide. The Q&A is as follows:

    Q: What is the significance and achievement of the patriotic labor emulation?

    A: The patriotic labor emulation movement is a major action by the Chinese working class in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Since the Ma Hengchang group challenged workers nationwide on January 17th of this year and received an enthusiastic response from workers across the country, this movement has developed more broadly and has begun to deepen in some areas. Because workers in various regions have promoted and learned the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang group in responding to the challenge of the emulation, the emulation movement has improved a step further compared to the past. Generally speaking, the response emulation in various places has yielded the following significant gains. First, it broke the guild-like conservative ideas among workers, strengthened the unity between technicians and workers, and improved the relationship between teachers and apprentices; second, on this basis, it strengthened technical research and learning, improved technology, improved labor organization, and overcame the strike bias of simply increasing labor intensity, making the labor emulation begin to move towards regularization; third, it established and improved various necessary and reasonable production systems, improved production management work, and consolidated the results of the emulation. This situation shows that the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang group has played a considerable role in promoting and guiding the production work of industrial and mining enterprises across the country. In addition, workers in various places have carried out patriotic current affairs learning on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the emulation, their political awareness has been raised, and they have fully demonstrated their labor enthusiasm and creative spirit, so production efficiency has rapidly increased, and new production records have continued to emerge. This has greatly promoted the production movement and promoted the development of national defense and economic construction. In addition, the work of trade unions at all levels, especially the work of trade union grassroots organizations, has been further improved in the process of the emulation. With the continued development of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the patriotic labor emulation is now continuing to develop widely and deeply across the country and will surely achieve greater results.

    Q: What are some of the shortcomings and problems that still exist in the current patriotic labor emulation?

    A: The current shortcomings and problems in the emulation are mainly that some trade union cadres do not pay enough attention to the labor emulation; the leadership of the emulation is not specific and in-depth enough. There are ideological problems here, as well as methodological problems. Due to an incorrect understanding of labor emulation ideologically, an incorrect attitude towards the emulation movement has occurred. For example, a small number of trade union cadres have not actively supported the emulation enthusiasm and actions of workers, and even put the challenges proposed by workers in their own pockets and suppressed them. Although some also organized emulation, they did not discuss it with the workers, but only discussed it with the trade union cadres and labor models and decided. Although this phenomenon is a minority and has been corrected in a timely manner, it cannot be said that similar phenomena have been completely eliminated. In most cases, the main problem in the current emulation is that many trade union cadres lack experience in organizing and leading emulation. This is manifested in the fact that the emulation conditions and plans of some units are not proposed in response to the main problems and shortcomings in the current production, or there are emulation goals but a lack of practical and concrete methods. Some units have launched emulation, but have not combined it with the improvement of the entire enterprise management work, or simply engage in group challenges while ignoring how to promote the improvement of the entire workshop or even the entire factory production work through the group. This weakens the effect of the emulation movement on improving production or prevents the effects already obtained from being consolidated and expanded, hindering the wider and deeper development of the emulation movement.

    Q: What issues should be paid attention to in future labor emulation?

    A: In order to make the labor emulation more widely and deeply developed and gradually move towards regularization, it is necessary to strengthen the specific leadership of the movement by trade unions at all levels, especially trade union grassroots organizations. First, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the patriotic political education of workers, especially current affairs education, to further enlighten the class awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses of workers. Experience has proven that in places where political education, especially current affairs education, is carried out more widely and deeply, the production mood of workers there is more full, and the labor emulation is also more widespread and in-depth. Second, it is necessary to grasp the key issues in production, combine them with the reform of enterprise management work and the strengthening of workshop work, formulate clear and specific emulation goals and emulation conditions, and formulate specific plans and methods for achieving the emulation conditions. Third, it is necessary to discover and summarize advanced production experience in a timely manner, and use various methods to promote it in an organized and planned manner, so that the advanced parts can drive the backward parts and improve together. Fourth, it is necessary to formulate certain reward methods, improve labor conditions and the lives and welfare of workers as much as possible, and it is best to adopt a collective contract method to fix it.

　　全国总工会生产部董昕部长
    谈目前职工爱国主义劳动竞赛问题
    中华全国总工会生产部董昕部长就目前全国职工开展的爱国主义劳动竞赛问题，答新华社记者问。问答如下：
    问：爱国主义劳动竞赛的意义和成就如何？
    答：爱国主义劳动竞赛运动是中国工人阶级进行抗美援朝的一项主要行动。自今年一月十七日马恒昌小组向全国工人挑战并得到全国工人的热烈响应以来，这一运动有了更广泛的发展，并在部分地区开始深入。由于各地职工在应战竞赛中推广与学习了马恒昌小组的先进生产经验，已使竞赛运动较过去提高了一步。一般地说，各地的应战竞赛都有以下显著收获。首先是打破了职工中行会主义的保守观念，加强了技术人员和工人间的团结，改善了师徒关系；其次是在以上基础上，加强了技术研究与学习，改进技术，改进劳动组织，克服了单纯提高劳动强度的突击偏向，使劳动竞赛开始走向经常化；再次是建立与健全了各种必要的合理的生产制度，改进了生产管理工作，使竞赛成果巩固下来。这种情况说明，马恒昌小组的先进的生产经验，已经对于全国各地工矿企业的生产工作起了相当程度的推动作用和指导作用。加以各地职工在竞赛中进行了抗美援朝爱国主义的时事学习，政治觉悟提高，充分发挥了劳动热情和创造精神，因而生产效率迅速提高，生产新纪录不断涌现。这就大大推动了生产运动，促进了国防建设和经济建设的发展。此外，各级工会的工作，特别是工会基层组织的工作，也在竞赛的过程中进一步健全起来。随着抗美援朝运动的继续开展，爱国主义劳动竞赛现正在全国范围内继续广泛与深入地发展，必将取得更大的成绩。
    问：目前爱国主义劳动竞赛中还存在些什么缺点和问题？
    答：目前竞赛中的缺点和问题，主要是有些工会干部对劳动竞赛还不够重视；对竞赛的领导还不够具体、深入。这里有思想问题，也有方法问题。由于思想上对劳动竞赛的认识不正确，便发生了对竞赛运动的不正确态度。如曾有少数工会干部对职工的竞赛热情和行动，不予积极支持，甚至把工人提出的应战条件放在自己的口袋里压了起来。有些虽也组织竞赛，但没有经过职工群众讨论，只是由工会干部和劳动模范商量了一下便决定了。这种现象虽是少数，并且已及时加以纠正，但类似现象还不能说已完全消除。就多数情况来说，当前竞赛中的主要问题还是很多工会干部缺乏组织领导竞赛的经验。表现在有些单位的竞赛条件和计划没有针对当前生产中的主要问题和缺点而提出，或者是有了竞赛目标但缺乏切实的具体办法。有的单位开展了竞赛，但没有与整个企业管理工作的改进相结合，或者是单纯搞小组应战而忽略了如何通过小组推动整个车间甚至全厂生产工作的改进。这样就减弱了竞赛运动对于改进生产的效果或使已得到的效果不能巩固和扩大，障碍了竞赛运动更广泛深入地发展。
    问：今后的劳动竞赛应注意些什么问题？
    答：要使劳动竞赛更广泛深入地开展并逐步走向经常化，今后必须加强各级工会、特别是工会基层组织对运动的具体领导。第一，要继续对职工加强爱国主义的政治教育，特别是时事教育，进一步启发职工群众的阶级觉悟和爱国热情。经验证明，凡是政治教育特别是时事教育进行得比较广泛深入的地方，那里的职工的生产情绪就比较饱满，劳动竞赛也就比较广泛深入。第二，要抓紧生产上的关键问题，与改革企业管理工作与加强车间工作相结合，制订明确具体的竞赛目标和竞赛条件，并作出实现竞赛条件的具体计划和方法。第三，要及时发现与总结先进生产经验，运用各种方式，有组织有计划地加以推广，使先进部分带动落后部分，共同提高。第四，要制订一定的奖励办法，在可能条件下改善劳动条件和职工群众的生活福利，而且最好是采用集体合同的方式，把它固定起来。
