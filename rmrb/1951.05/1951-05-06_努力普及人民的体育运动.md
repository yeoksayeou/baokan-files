　　Strive to Popularize People's Sports
    Propaganda Department of the 1951 National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament

    Due to the oppression and exploitation of the long-term reactionary rule in the past, the health conditions of the broad masses of people and youth are currently very poor and cannot meet the country's increasingly important needs for national defense and construction. The fact that nearly half of the young students who signed up for military cadre schools in various places failed the physical examination has fully proven this point. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed in schools, "Health first." The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in its call to celebrate this year's "May Day" Labor Day, specifically mentioned: "Young students! Pay attention to physical exercise, study diligently, and prepare to serve the motherland!" We must actively strive to improve the health of young students and the broad masses of people.

    There are many factors and methods to improve health, such as paying attention to appropriate work and rest and nutrition, improving hygiene environment and habits, and maintaining a regular life. However, it should be particularly pointed out that participating in regular physical exercise is the most active and meaningful link. Sports is a science that promotes the human body's ability to work. It is based on physiology and uses various different sports forms to promote the comprehensive development of the human body, exercise a strong physique and abundant energy. It can not only enable people to recover from fatigue and have the ability to resist disease, but also further improve labor efficiency and be competent for heavy or long-term work. At the same time, sports is also a part of patriotic education, which can cultivate revolutionary qualities such as determination, courage, and wit. Sports has such an important role in improving people's health, carrying out patriotic education, and strengthening national defense and construction, which requires us to pay attention to it and vigorously promote and develop it among the people and youth. This is an indispensable task in the anti-US aggression and aid Korea patriotic movement.

    The Party and the People's Government have always attached importance to the people's sports and cared about and led its development. Over the past year, the people's sports has made great achievements, and the broad masses of people, especially young students, have an increasingly urgent demand for sports. On this basis, the 1951 National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament was held in Beijing on "May Fourth." The main purpose of this conference is to encourage and promote the popularization of people's sports serving national defense and construction through the competition of basketball and volleyball, which are relatively familiar to the masses; and to require the establishment of basketball and volleyball sports organizations, cultivate a large number of amateur basketball and volleyball sports activists, and improve them step by step to become regular activities. This kind of sports competition is an important way to popularize sports.

    At present, the state has a large expenditure on directly consolidating national defense and developing production, and we cannot ask the government to spend a lot of money on sports. We should develop sports in a planned and step-by-step manner based on the principle of spending no money or less money. It is not right to adopt an attitude of impatience or waiting.

    To develop sports, we should implement the policy of popularization first and resolutely change the situation in the past where sports was only an activity for a few people. Starting from organized groups such as schools, troops, factories, and agencies, popularize several simple and easy-to-implement sports of great value, such as gymnastics (including freehand and equipment), track and field, swimming, and national martial arts; call on the masses to participate in regular physical exercise under the banner of patriotism, overcome their concerns about not wanting to participate and phenomena such as being too hasty and not being able to persist. In order to ensure that people's sports becomes a regular movement for the masses, it is necessary to widely establish mass sports grassroots organizations and various sports groups in various units, and combine the seasons and festivals to hold various mass sports competitions. If there are not enough sports workers, short-term training can be used to train amateur sports cadres with basic knowledge of sports, single or several sports skills, and organizational capabilities.

    The Soviet Union's "Ready for Labor and Defense" system is a superior and complete system with comprehensive sports significance and content. Some large cities in our country can combine with the actual situation to study or start to try out this system, gain experience, and prepare to promote it nationwide in the future.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the people's sports movement, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has formulated a plan outline for carrying out sports activities from 1951 to 1952, which specifically stipulates the guidelines and tasks of the people's sports movement in the next two years. The All-China Sports Federation will be officially established in July this year, and sports branch organizations will also be established or improved in various places. The leading organs in various places should combine with the actual situation in their localities to urge the accurate implementation of this plan outline.

    The people's sports movement is still in the initial stage of development throughout the country, with a weak foundation, very few sports workers, and extremely uneven conditions in various places. Some leading organs in some places and schools have not paid enough attention to sports, thinking that sports is dispensable, just a game and entertainment, or using physical labor instead. Some sports workers have also lost or reduced confidence in the future of sports work because of this. This phenomenon of not paying attention to sports is wrong and needs to be understood and learned about the important significance of developing sports and corrected quickly.

    The increasingly vigorous development of the people's sports movement will surely make the people and youth develop more healthily in body and mind, and participate in work and study with unlimited enthusiasm without hindrance, so that the country's national defense, production, education and other construction undertakings will achieve even greater achievements.

　　努力普及人民的体育运动
    一九五一年全国篮排球比赛大会宣传部
    由于过去长期反动统治的压迫和剥削，目前广大人民和青年的健康情况很恶劣，不能满足国家日益重大的国防和建设的需要。各地报名参加军事干部学校的青年学生几乎有一半身体不合格的事实，已充分地证明了这一点。毛主席一再指示在学校里，“健康第一”，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会为庆祝今年“五一”劳动节的号召中特别一条提到：“青年学生们！注意锻炼身体，认真学习，准备为祖国服务！”我们要为增进青年学生和广大人民的健康而积极努力。
    增进健康的因素和方法很多，譬如注意适当的工作休息和营养、改善卫生环境和习惯、坚持规律的生活等，但是需要特别指出，参加经常的体育锻炼是其中最有积极意义的一环。体育是一种发扬人体劳动能力的科学，是根据生理，用各种不同的体育形式促使人体全面发展，锻炼健壮的体格和充沛的精力，不仅可以使人能够恢复疲劳，有抵抗疾病的能力，还能进一步提高劳动效率，胜任繁重或长时期的工作。同时，体育还是爱国主义教育的一部分，可以培养人的坚决、勇敢、机智等革命的品质。体育对于增进人民健康，进行爱国主义教育，加强国防和建设的力量具有这样的重要作用，亟需我们加以重视并大力在人民和青年中提倡和发展，这是抗美援朝爱国运动中不可缺少的工作。
    党和人民政府从来就重视人民的体育，并关心和领导它的发展。一年来，人民的体育已取得了极大的成绩，广大的群众特别是青年学生对于体育的要求日益迫切。在此基础之上，一九五一年全国篮排球比赛大会于“五四”在北京召开了。这次大会的主要目的是要通过在群众中比较熟悉的篮排球运动的竞赛，鼓舞和推动为国防和建设而服务的人民体育的普及；并要求建立起篮排球运动的组织，培养大批业余的篮排球运动积极分子，使之提高一步，成为经常的活动。这种运动竞赛是普及体育的重要方式。
    目前国家在直接的巩固国防和发展生产方面的费用支出很大，我们不能要求政府拿出很多的经费用在体育上。我们应根据不花钱或少花钱的原则，有计划有步骤地发展体育，采取急躁或等待的情绪都是不对的。
    发展体育，应当贯彻首先普及的方针，坚决改变过去体育仅为少数人的活动的情况。从学校、部队、工厂和机关等有组织的群众中开始，普及几项简单易行而价值很大的运动，如体操（包括徒手和器械）、田径、游泳和国术等；以爱国主义的旗帜号召群众参加经常的体育锻炼，克服其不愿参加的顾虑和操之过急、不能持久等现象。为了保证人民体育成为群众的一种经常性的运动，必须广泛在各单位中建立起群众性的体育基层组织和各种运动小组，并结合季节和节日举行各种群众性的运动竞赛。体育工作者不足，可以利用短期培养具有体育的基本知识，单项或几项运动技术和组织能力的体育业余干部。
    苏联体育运动的“准备劳动与卫国”制度，是有全面的体育意义和内容的极优越的完整的制度。我国有些大的城市可以结合实际情况，研究或着手试行这种制度，取得经验，准备将来在全国推行。
    为了加强人民体育运动的领导，中华全国体育总会筹备委员会已作出了一九五一到一九五二年开展体育运动的计划大纲，具体地规定了今后两年内人民体育运动的方针任务。并将在今年七月正式成立中华全国体育总会，各地也要建立或健全体育分会的组织。各地的领导机关应当结合当地的实际情况，督促这个计划大纲准确地实现。
    在全国范围内人民的体育运动还处于开始发展的阶段，基础薄弱，体育工作者极少，各地情况极不平衡。有些地方和学校等领导机关对于体育还没有引起足够的重视，认为体育可有可无，不过是游戏娱乐而已，或者用体力劳动代替等。有些体育工作者也因此对体育工作的前途丧失或减低信心，这种不重视体育的现象是不对的，需要对于发展体育的重要意义进行必要的了解和学习，而加以迅速纠正。
    人民体育运动日益蓬勃地展开，必定会使得人民和青年的身心日益健全地发展，毫无阻碍地以无限热情参加工作学习，使得国家的国防，生产和教育等建设事业得到更高的成就。
