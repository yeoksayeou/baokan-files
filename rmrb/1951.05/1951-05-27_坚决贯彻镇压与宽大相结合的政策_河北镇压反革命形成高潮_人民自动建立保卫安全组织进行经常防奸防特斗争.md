　　[This News Agency] Hebei Province, since vigorously mobilizing the masses to suppress counter-revolutionaries, has arrested and executed a group of extremely wicked special agents, habitual bandits, despotic landlords, and reactionary secret society leaders, dealing a heavy blow to the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and powerfully safeguarding the production and construction and the lives and property of the people. The political consciousness and enthusiasm of the broad masses of people have been greatly enhanced, creating a mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The people generally reflect: "When the peasants have no land to cultivate, the people's government leads the implementation of land reform; when the people have no food to eat, the people's government leads the people to self-salvation through production; when the people are harmed and disrupted by counter-revolutionary elements, the people's government resolutely suppresses counter-revolutionaries. With Chairman Mao and such a people's government, the people will be liberated forever and will always be victorious!" The emancipated peasants call this severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries the "Third Great Liberation." Workers say: "With the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements, there will be no more sabotage accidents in factories, and the working class can better lead production and construction!" Farmers say: "Landlords dare not seize land again, let's produce with peace of mind!" Merchants say: "There are fewer robbers, and business is easier to do." Facts prove that the policy of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries is entirely the urgent demand of the broad masses of people.
　　Since February of this year, various cities, counties, and towns in Hebei Province have universally convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life. Cangxian County and other towns have also convened representative conferences from various sectors and industries such as industry and commerce, culture and education, religion, medical services, and Hui people, as well as more than ten types of large and small meetings for factories, streets, party members, league members, and backbone elements of the emancipated peasants. In rural areas, counties such as Gaocheng have also universally convened village-wide accusation meetings and small-scale grievance forums for wives, old men, women, and youth, and students, enabling most people to study the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." Various forms were adopted to specifically expose the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements using real people and real events, and extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work was carried out, making it known to every household. According to incomplete statistics from nine counties in Cangxian Prefecture, 22,865 propaganda cadres were trained; eight counties organized a total of 144,000 district and village cadres, school teachers and students, party members, and league members to participate in this propaganda work. Qingyuan County also had 620 propagandists and 57 reporters who actively promoted the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Tianjin County universally convened mass meetings by village, explaining the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and about 80% of the masses received propaganda and education on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Before handling counter-revolutionary criminals, some counties and towns in Tianjin and Tangshan Prefectures, in addition to convening standing committees or expanded meetings of people's representatives from all walks of life for discussion, also systematically printed and distributed materials on the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements for mass discussion and to solicit opinions on how to handle them. People's representatives and the masses from all walks of life believe that the government is truly the people's government, and they consult with the masses on everything. Therefore, the sense of ownership of the broad masses has been greatly enhanced.
　　After propaganda and education, the masses in various parts of Hebei Province actively accused, reported, and assisted the government in detecting and arresting counter-revolutionary elements. Tianjin County received more than 800 letters of accusation from the masses in seven days. Tongxian County has received 964 letters of accusation since February. With the help of the masses, Funing County captured Zhao Ziheng and other arch-criminals who had not been caught for many years. Many model deeds have emerged among village cadres and militiamen. For example, when Hou Qin, the militia captain of Wentun Village in Xincheng County, was escorting the murderer Xie Qingyuan, the criminal knelt down and begged for mercy, saying: "If you save my life, I will give you 800 jin of oil, a rubber-wheeled cart, a mule, ten mu of good land, and also give you my 25-year-old daughter." Hou Qin sternly refused. Many cadres and masses reported their relatives, and the broad masses clearly distinguished the enemy from ourselves ideologically.
　　Due to the severe suppression of the arch-criminals of counter-revolution, the enthusiasm of the masses for production and safeguarding production has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Workers at the Tangshan Steel Plant set three new records in less than a month, completing the monthly task in 20 days. The coal production efficiency of the Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine in Kailuan increased by more than 100%. There are already 419 workers' groups in the Linxi Mine that have formulated and earnestly implemented patriotic covenants. Railway workers, brick kiln workers, transport workers, and waterway repair workers in various places have all taken practical actions of striving for production to support the people's government's measures to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In the patriotic covenants formulated by the workers, reporting counter-revolutionary elements is also listed as a major item; various factories and mines have also spontaneously established systems such as shift handover and signing for entry and exit to strengthen security organizations. The emancipated peasants are no longer afraid of the landlords' counterattacks to seize land, and actively accumulate fertilizer and purchase agricultural tools, launching a bumper harvest competition movement.
　　In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, various localities have correctly implemented the policy of "combining suppression and leniency," leniently handling a group of counter-revolutionary elements who have performed meritorious service or whose crimes are minor and who sincerely repent, and implementing sentences of imprisonment or control, engaging in labor reform. Under the influence of the correct policy, many counter-revolutionary elements have repented and registered with the government, handing over certificates, firearms, etc., and requesting to atone for their crimes with meritorious service. According to statistics from Tianjin, Tangshan, Handan, Xingtai, and Tongxian five prefectures and Qinhuangdao City, counter-revolutionary elements have turned in 155 rifles and pistols, three machine guns, and 6,519 rounds of ammunition. Some landlords and old rich peasants who counterattacked have taken the initiative to return land and things, asking for leniency and lenient handling. Some counter-revolutionary elements under control have also behaved honestly.
　　Since the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the public security situation in various places has also improved compared to before. Before the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Tianjin Prefecture was an area where the activities of special agents and bandits were relatively serious. From July to December last year, a total of 93 robbery cases occurred. Since the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, only two cases have occurred in March and April of this year.
　　Although the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Hebei Province has formed a huge mass movement, a few die-hard counter-revolutionary elements will still not stop their sabotage activities because of the suppression. On the contrary, in order to make a last-ditch struggle, the activities of counter-revolutionary elements are more concealed, and the means of retaliation and sabotage against the people are more vicious and brutal. Since March and April, Yixian, Laishui, Zunhua, Linyu, Funing and other counties have successively experienced 38 mountain fires, with a burned area of about 2,899,431 mu of mountain forests, destroying more than 29 million large and small trees. It has been confirmed from the investigation of cases in Yixian and Linyu that the fires were deliberately set by counter-revolutionary elements for revenge. The railway of the Chakou Section of the Zhaogezhuang Mine in Kailuan, Tangshan City, was had its spikes removed, causing coal trucks to derail. The ventilation pipes of the Tangshan Mine were sabotaged twice. According to statistics, nine similar sabotage incidents occurred in factories and mines in Tangshan City in March. Retaliatory sabotage incidents such as burning locomotives were discovered at Shijiazhuang Railway Station. After Liangjiacun Village, Xincheng County, the militia captain of the residential area was murdered by counter-revolutionary elements and thrown into a well, the case has now been solved, and it was done by the Xincheng Chiang Kai-shek military spy group. A platoon leader of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Hanjia Tuan, Tongxian County, assassinated a village cadre and his entire family of four. According to statistics for March and April, a total of 24 assassination incidents occurred, resulting in 31 casualties among our cadres and the masses. Therefore, the people's governments at all levels in Hebei Province are continuing to mobilize the broad masses to better carry out the accusation and reporting movement against counter-revolutionary elements, and to mobilize the broad masses of the people to organize strict organizations for public security and defense to eliminate traitors and prevent special agents, to lead the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionary movement to a deeper and more regular level.

　　坚决贯彻镇压与宽大相结合的政策
    河北镇压反革命形成高潮
    人民自动建立保卫安全组织进行经常防奸防特斗争
    【本报讯】河北省自从大张旗鼓发动群众镇压反革命以来，逮捕和杀掉了一批罪大恶极的特务、惯匪、恶霸地主、反动会道门头子，使反革命残余势力遭到沉重打击，有力地保卫了生产建设和人民群众生命财产的安全。广大人民的政治觉悟和积极性大大提高，造成了镇压反革命的群众运动。人民群众普遍反映：“农民没地种，人民政府就领导实行土地改革；人民没饭吃，人民政府就领导人民生产自救；人民被反革命分子祸害捣乱，人民政府就坚决镇压反革命。有了毛主席和这样的人民政府，人民就永远翻身了，永远胜利了！”翻身农民把这次严厉镇压反革命称为“第三次大翻身”。工人们说：“镇压了反革命分子，工厂就不出破坏事故了，工人阶级就好领导进行生产建设了！”农民说：“地主再不敢夺地了，踏实地生产吧！”商人说：“劫道的少了，买卖好作了。”事实证明：坚决镇压反革命的政策，完全是广大人民的迫切要求。
    今年二月以来，河北省各市、县、镇普遍召开了各界人民代表会议，沧县等城镇还分别召开了工商界、文教界、宗教界、医务界及回民等各界各行业的代表会议，和工厂、街道、党员、团员、翻身骨干等十余种大小型会议。藁城等县在农村也普遍召开了全村控诉大会和老婆、老头、妇女、青年、学生等小型诉苦座谈会，使大部分人学习了《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》，并采用了各种形式，用活人活事具体揭发了反革命分子的罪恶，进行了广泛深入的宣传教育工作，作到了家喻户晓。据沧县专区九个县不完全的统计，就训练了二万二千八百六十五个宣传干部；八个县共组织了区村干部、学校师生、党员、团员十四万四千多人，参加这一宣传工作。清苑县也有六百二十名宣传员，五十七名报告员，积极宣传镇压反革命政策。天津县普遍以村为单位召开了群众大会，讲解了镇压反革命政策，约有百分之八十的群众受到镇压反革命的宣传教育。天津专区及唐山专区有些县镇在处理反革命罪犯以前，除召开了各界人民代表常务委员会或扩大会进行商讨外，并有计划地印发了反革命分子的罪恶材料，交群众讨论，征求处理意见。各界人民代表和群众都认为，政府真是人民的政府，遇事都要和群众商量。因此大大提高了广大群众主人翁的感觉。
    河北省各地群众经过宣传教育后，积极控诉，检举，和协助政府侦捕反革命分子。天津县七天中就收到了群众控诉书八百多件。通县从二月以来就收到控诉书九百六十四件。抚宁县在群众帮助下，捕获了多年侦察没有捉住的反革命首恶罪犯赵子恒等。在村干部和民兵中，更出现了许多模范事迹，如新城县温屯村中队长侯勤，押解杀人犯谢庆元时，该犯跪地求饶说：“你要救我一命，给你八百斤油，一辆胶皮车，一个骡子，十亩好地，还把我二十五岁的闺女送给你。”被侯勤严词拒绝。并有不少干部和群众检举自己的亲人，广大群众都从思想上明确地划清了敌我界线。
    由于严厉镇压了反革命首恶分子，群众生产和保卫生产的积极性空前提高。唐山钢厂工人不到一月连创三次新纪录，二十天完成全月任务。开滦唐家庄煤矿产煤效率提高了百分之百强。林西矿订立和切实执行爱国公约的，已有四百一十九个工人小组。各地的铁路工人、砖窑工人、运输工人和修理水道工人等，都以努力生产的实际行动，来拥护人民政府镇压反革命的措施。工人们在制订的爱国公约中，也把检举反革命分子列为主要项目；各厂矿还自动建立了交接班和出入厂签名检查等制度，加强安全组织。翻身农民再不怕地主反攻夺地，积极积肥和购买农具，展开丰产竞赛运动。
    在镇压反革命运动中，各地正确贯彻了“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策，宽大处理了一批有立功表现或罪恶轻微、真诚悔过的反革命分子，实行判处徒刑或管制，从事劳动改造。在正确政策的影响下，不少反革命分子向政府悔过登记，交出证件枪支等，要求立功赎罪。据天津、唐山、邯郸、邢台、通县五个专区和秦皇岛市统计，反革命分子已交出长短枪一百五十五支、机枪三挺、子弹六千五百一十九发。有些反攻的地主、旧富农，主动地退地退东西，要求饶命宽大处理。一些被管制的反革命分子，也表现得老实了。
    严厉镇压反革命以来，各地治安情况也比前好了。天津专区在镇压反革命以前，是特务匪徒活动比较严重的地区，去年七月到十二月共发生抢劫案九十三起，自从严厉镇压反革命以来，今年三、四两月就只发生了两起。
    河北省镇压反革命虽已形成巨大的群众性运动，但是少数死心塌地的反革命分子，仍然不会因为镇压而停止破坏活动。相反，反革命分子为了作垂死挣扎，活动方式更加隐蔽，向人民进行报复破坏的手段更加毒辣残暴。三、四月份以来，易县、涞水、遵化、临榆、抚宁等县，连续发生烧山事件三十八次，被烧面积约有二百八十九万九千四百三十一亩山林，烧毁大小树木二千九百多万棵。易县、临榆两地已从破案中证实是反革命分子蓄意报复放的火。唐山市开滦赵各庄矿查工处铁路曾被拔道钉，使煤车出轨。唐山矿通风管两次遭破坏，据统计，三月份里，唐山市厂矿发生类似破坏事件九起。石家庄车站发现烧机车等报复破坏事件。新城县梁家庄村小区民兵中队长被反革命分子暗害后扔在井里，现已破案，是新城蒋匪军统特务小组干的。通县韩家疃蒋匪军一个排长暗杀一个村干部全家四口。据三、四月份统计，共发生暗杀事件二十四起，伤亡我干部群众三十一人。因此，河北省各级人民政府，正继续发动广大群众，更好地开展对反革命分子的控诉与检举运动，并动员广大人民群众组织治安保卫除奸防特的严密组织，把大张旗鼓镇压反革命的运动引向深入和经常化。
