　　Cultural Life Updates
　　The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Film Team warmly welcomed at the Huai River Construction Site
　　The film propaganda team dispatched by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of migrant workers while screening movies at the Huai River construction site. Every time the sun set, teams of migrant workers, disregarding their fatigue from the day, gathered while singing to the open space where the film was to be shown. The villagers from nearby villages also came happily. The vast majority of people there were watching a movie for the first time. Whenever the narrator introduced Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin on the screen, the square immediately boiled with shouts of "Thank you, Chairman Mao!" "Thank you, Communist Party!" "Long live Marshal Stalin!"
　　From March 15th to April 18th, the film team screened 38 films at the construction sites of Su County, Lingbi, Sihong, Si County, and other counties in northern Anhui, with an audience of more than 755,000 people; the films screened included "New China Newsreel," "Defend World Peace," "They Have a Motherland," "Sino-Soviet Friendship," and "Seven-Colored Flower." The film team has now departed for the construction sites in Xuchang and Xinyang in Henan Province to continue screening films for the local migrant workers.

　　Great Development in Rural Cultural and Educational Undertakings in Southern Anhui Nearly 800 Farmers Become Newspaper Correspondents
　　Rural education in the Southern Anhui region has greatly developed after the land reform. Last winter and this spring, more than 6,000 winter schools were held throughout the region, with more than 255,000 farmers participating in the learning. Farmers who have studied in winter schools for two or three months can generally recognize 300 to 400 characters. After the winter school ended this spring, more than 400 year-round farmers' spare-time schools were established in various places, and more than 20,000 farmers have enrolled.
　　After the land reform, rural primary school education has greatly developed. According to the statistics of the Cultural and Education Department of the Southern Anhui People's Administrative Office: in the first semester of this year, a total of 785 primary schools were newly established in the region, and the number of students increased by more than 57,000. Many farmers actively assist the people's government in running schools.
　　While learning culture, the vast number of emancipated farmers are also actively demanding to learn politics and current affairs. Many farmers have developed the habit of reading newspapers regularly. Some people who cannot understand the newspaper participate in reading groups and listen to others read. They said, "Not listening to the newspaper reading for a day is like missing a meal!" Many farmers also frequently contribute to newspapers, reporting on their production and life situations. This spring, there are already 790 farmers in the region who have become correspondents for the *Southern Anhui Daily*.

    中苏友好协会总会派遣的电影宣传队在治淮工地放映电影，受到成千成万民工的热烈欢迎。每当夕阳落下山头，一队队的民工不顾一天的疲劳唱着歌聚集到将要放映电影的空场上来。附近村庄的老乡们也兴高采烈地赶来。那里绝大部分的人是第一次看电影。每当讲解人介绍银幕上出现的毛主席和斯大林大元帅时，广场上立刻就沸腾起“感谢毛主席！”“感谢共产党！”“斯大林大元帅万岁！”的喊声来。
    从三月十五日到四月十八日，电影队在皖北的宿县、灵璧、泗洪、泗县等县的工地放映了电影三十八场，观众达七十五万五千多人；放映的片子有《新中国简报》、《捍卫世界和平》、《他们有祖国》、《中苏友好》、《七彩花》等。现在电影队已出发到河南省的许昌、信阳等工地去，继续为当地的民工们放映电影。
