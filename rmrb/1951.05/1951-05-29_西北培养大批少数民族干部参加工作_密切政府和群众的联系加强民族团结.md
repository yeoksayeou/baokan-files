Northwest China Cultivates a Large Number of Ethnic Minority Cadres to Participate in Work
    Strengthening Ties Between the Government and the People, and Enhancing Ethnic Unity

The leading organs of various provinces in Northwest China have made great achievements in cultivating ethnic minority cadres. According to incomplete statistics as of March this year, there are already more than 22,000 ethnic minority cadres in various work positions throughout the region, a fourfold increase compared to six months ago. Among them, Xinjiang Province has more than 17,000 (accounting for slightly less than 74 percent of the total number of cadres in the province), Qinghai Province has more than 2,000, Gansu Province has 1,976, Ningxia Province has 1,050, and the first-level organs in the Northwest Region and Xi'an City have a total of more than 40. Currently, all 16 ethnic minorities in the region have their own ethnic cadres participating in the work.

Many cadres from fraternal ethnic groups in people's governments at all levels and in various people's organizations are principal responsible cadres or participate in leadership work. Among the 16 chairmen and vice-chairmen and 117 members of the People's Governments of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, there are 55 ethnic minority individuals. Two of the three chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government are Uyghur, and 70 to 80 percent of the leading cadres in the various departments and bureaus of the provincial government and its 10 prefectures (including 80 counties and cities) are cadres from various fraternal ethnic groups. Among the six counties and one city under the Linxia Prefecture of Gansu Province, the county heads of three counties, the deputy county heads of two counties, and the mayor of one city are Hui cadres. In the 35 counties and cities of Qinghai and Ningxia provinces, 22 individuals from Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups serve as county heads or deputy county heads. The provincial people's governments also pay attention to promoting advanced women from fraternal ethnic groups to participate in leadership work. For example, the county head of Hejing County in Xinjiang Province is Ximouzhen, a Mongolian woman, and Qinghai Province also has two Hui and Tibetan women serving as township heads.

Because the people's governments at all levels in Northwest China have cultivated and used a large number of cadres from fraternal ethnic groups, they have made great progress in connecting with the masses, deepening work, and strengthening ethnic unity. For example, in Guyuan County, Gansu Province, where the Hui people account for one-third of the county's population, the relationship between the Hui people and the local people's government was not very close in the early days of liberation. Later, the higher-level government promoted some Hui cadres to participate in work and appointed the Hui cadre Luo Mingdao as the deputy county head, which quickly changed the previous situation. Every day, seven or eight Hui people went to the county government to report the situation, enabling the county's leading organs to solve some important issues related to the Hui and Han people in a timely and smooth manner. In the first township of the second district of Minhe County, Qinghai Province, the Hui and Han people, under the leadership of the township head Ma Jisheng (Hui), assisted the people's government in capturing more than 30 bandits and special agents and seizing 15 guns. In Shancheng Township, Ledu County, Qinghai Province, the Tibetan and Han people had been fighting for the right to lease land from the Lamasery for many years, and three armed conflicts had occurred. After liberation, under the mediation of the Tibetan deputy township head, the two sides have now reconciled. The seventh township of the fourth district of Zhongning County, Ningxia Province, is an area where the Hui and Han people live together. Before liberation, they had disputes over the election of water conservancy section chiefs and often fought. After liberation, because the Hui Ma Guangrong served as the township head, the estrangement between the Hui and Han people has been eliminated, and they are helping each other in production. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, the Hui and Han people in the township organized more than 40 work-exchange groups to help each other in production.

According to the experience of the Northwest Region over the past year, the effective methods for cultivating cadres from fraternal ethnic groups, in addition to working hard to run ethnic cadre schools and training courses, are to give ethnic minority cadres extra patient cultivation, bold use, and specific guidance in their work. When absorbing cadres from fraternal ethnic groups to participate in work, most of the people's governments in Northwest China go through the "making friends" stage, first dispelling their concerns, enlightening their awareness, and then gradually absorbing them into their work positions. In their work, most adopted the "apprentice" method, telling them more about work methods, listening to their opinions with humility, praising them immediately when they achieve results, and patiently educating them when they have shortcomings, criticizing them cautiously and appropriately. At the same time, they help them improve politically; in learning and in life, they also take care of their special circumstances and respect their customs and religious beliefs. Many cadres from fraternal ethnic groups have made rapid progress after receiving such sincere and meticulous help. For example, Wang Zhanqing, a Hui from Chuanwang Township, Qingshui County, Gansu Province, was elected as a representative to the county peasant representative conference and a standing member of the district peasant association from a village appraiser in the grain requisition work the year before last, due to the support of the local masses and the cultivation of the leading organs. Soon, he was appointed as the township head. Last year, because of his achievements in grain requisition and winning over bandits, he was also rated as a model township head at the county cadre conference.

At present, there is still a great lack of professional cadres and pastoral area cadres of ethnic minorities in the Northwest provinces, and the administrative cadres who have been promoted are also in urgent need of improvement. The leading organs of the provinces have paid attention to the above situation. The cadre training class in Xinjiang Province has established commercial trade, animal husbandry, judicial, translation and other teams, and there are now more than 1,200 young people from various ethnic groups participating in the study. The Di (hua) Prefecture of the province has also established a Kazakh cadre training class in the three counties of Qi (tai), Fu (yuan), and Mu (lei river), specializing in training cadres for the construction of pastoral areas. Huzu, Minhe, Huzhu, Ledu and other counties in Qinghai Province recently held a half-month cadre training class, which greatly helped to improve the policy level of cadres of various fraternal ethnic groups.

### 西北培养大批少数民族干部参加工作  密切政府和群众的联系加强民族团结

　　西北培养大批少数民族干部参加工作
    密切政府和群众的联系加强民族团结
    西北各省领导机关对培养少数民族干部的工作，已有很大成绩。截至今年三月的不完全统计：全区在各个工作岗位上的少数民族干部已有两万二千余名，比半年前增加了四倍。其中新疆省有一万七千余名（占该省干部总数的百分之七十四弱），青海省有两千余名，甘肃省有一千九百七十六名，宁夏省有一千零五十名，西北区一级机关及西安市共有四十余名，现全区十六个少数民族中，均已有了自己民族的干部参加工作。
    各兄弟民族干部在各级人民政府及各人民团体中，很多是主要负责干部或参与领导工作。新疆、青海、甘肃、宁夏四省人民政府的十六名正、副主席及一百一十七名委员中，就有少数民族人士五十五名。新疆省人民政府的三个正、副主席中有两个是维吾尔族，该省人民政府各厅处及所辖十个专区（包括八十个县、市）的领导干部中，有百分之七十至八十为各兄弟民族的干部。甘肃省临夏专区所属的六县一市中，有三个县的县长、两个县的副县长和一个市的市长是回族干部。青海、宁夏两省的三十五个县市中，回、藏、蒙等民族人士任县长或副县长的就有二十二人。各省人民政府并注意提拔各兄弟民族中的先进妇女参加领导工作。如新疆省和靖县县长为蒙族妇女西谋珍，青海省也有两名回族和藏族妇女担任乡长。
    西北各级人民政府由于大量培养和使用了各兄弟民族干部，使政府在联系群众、深入工作与加强民族团结等方面，都获得很大进展。如回族人民占全县人口三分之一的甘肃固原县，在解放初期，回族人民与当地人民政府的关系不甚密切，后来上级政府提拔了一些回族干部参加工作，并委任回族干部罗明道担任了该县副县长，就迅速地改变了以前的情况，每天都有七、八位回族人民到县政府去反映情况，使该县领导机关及时顺利地解决了一些与回、汉人民有关的重要问题。青海省民和县二区一乡的回族、汉族人民，在该乡乡长马继胜（回族）领导下，曾协助人民政府先后捕获土匪特务三十余名，缴获了十五支枪。该省乐都县山城乡的藏族和汉族人民，多年来争夺喇嘛寺土地的承佃权，曾发生过三次械斗，解放后在藏族副乡长的调解下，现双方已经和好。宁夏省中宁县四区七乡，是回、汉民族人民杂居区。在解放前，他们为选举水利段长发生纠纷，经常打架斗殴。解放后，由于回族马广荣担任了乡长，现回、汉族人民的隔阂已消除，并在生产中互助合作。今年春耕开始，该乡回、汉人民就组织了四十多个变工组互助生产。
    根据西北区一年来的经验证明：培养兄弟民族干部的有效办法，除努力办好民族干部学校和训练班外，就是要在工作中对少数民族干部格外耐心培养、放手使用与具体指导。西北各地人民政府在吸收兄弟民族干部参加工作时，多数经过“交朋友”阶段，先解除他们的顾虑，启发他们的觉悟，然后逐步吸收到工作岗位上来。在工作中，大部分又采用了“带徒弟”方式，多告诉他们工作办法，虚心听取他们的意见，有成绩时立即表扬，有缺点时耐心地教育，慎重而恰当地批评。同时，帮助他们在政治上提高；在学习上及生活上，也照顾他们的特殊情况，尊重他们的风俗习惯与宗教信仰。许多兄弟民族干部得到了这样诚恳、细致的帮助后，进步很快。例如甘肃省清水县川王乡回族王占清，由于当地群众的拥护和领导机关的培养，从前年征粮工作中的村评议员被选为县农民代表会议的代表、区农会常务委员，不久便担任了乡长的职务。去年因他在征粮和争取土匪投诚工作中有成绩，又被该县干部会议评为模范乡长。
    现在西北各省少数民族的专业干部与游牧区干部还很缺乏，已经提拔起来的行政干部也亟待提高。各省领导机关对上述情况已予重视。新疆省干部训练班中已设立了商业贸易、畜牧、司法、翻译等队，现有各民族青年一千二百余人参加学习。该省迪化专区并成立了奇（台）孚（远）木（垒河）三县哈萨克族干部训练班，专门培养牧区建政干部。青海省互助、民和、壶源、乐都等县，最近曾举办了为期半月的干部训练班，对于提高各兄弟民族干部的政策水平，帮助很大。
