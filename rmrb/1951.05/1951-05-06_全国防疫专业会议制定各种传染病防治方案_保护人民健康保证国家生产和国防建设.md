　　National Anti-Epidemic Professional Conference Formulates Various Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Programs
　　Protect People's Health and Ensure National Production and National Defense Construction
　　In order to discuss how to better prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases throughout the country, further protect people's health, and ensure national production and national defense construction, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government convened a National Anti-Epidemic Professional Conference in Beijing from April 10th to 23rd. The conference clarified the direction of future anti-epidemic work, formulated prevention and control programs for various of the most harmful infectious diseases, and drafted the "Regulations on the Management of Statutory Infectious Diseases (Draft)" and regulations on anti-epidemic work.
　　Attending the conference were 212 people in total, including heads of anti-epidemic departments of health authorities of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, and national experts in various infectious diseases.
　　Li Dequan, Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, first made a summary report on the national anti-epidemic work in 1950 at the conference. She pointed out that infectious diseases had been basically controlled throughout the country last year, and vigorous efforts had been made in health work in disaster areas and anti-epidemic work had begun in ethnic minority areas, and the achievements were unprecedented. She also emphasized that uniting Chinese and Western medicine, mobilizing the masses to participate in the work, and obtaining the attention of local administrative leaders are necessary conditions for making achievements in anti-epidemic work.
　　The conference was divided into eleven groups according to various infectious diseases, biological products, anti-epidemic institutions, and anti-epidemic laws and regulations. Each group first widely exchanged work experiences from various regions over the past year, presented typical reports, then summarized the effective methods in the work of various regions, referred to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and designated experts to draft prevention and control programs for various infectious diseases based on China's actual situation.
　　After more than ten days of repeated discussions by various experts, the conference formulated prevention and control programs for nineteen infectious diseases, including plague, cholera, smallpox, diphtheria, typhus, relapsing fever, typhoid fever, dysentery, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, malaria, Japanese schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, kala-azar, tuberculosis, leprosy, and venereal diseases, as well as the "Regulations on the Management of Statutory Infectious Diseases (Draft)" and fourteen other documents on regulations regarding anti-epidemic work. These programs and regulations will be reviewed and promulgated by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government or submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval before implementation.
　　He Cheng, Deputy Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, made a summary of the conference. He pointed out that in order to realize the health work policy of "prevention first," anti-epidemic work should be the focus at the current stage. The future tasks of anti-epidemic work are, first, to control acute infectious diseases so that they do not occur or spread, and especially not to allow infectious diseases to affect the country's production and national defense construction; that is to say, in areas such as economic lifelines, national defense front lines, transportation hubs, and political centers, we should first prevent the occurrence and spread of cholera, smallpox, plague, and other diseases that are sufficient to hinder the normal work and life order in those places. We must adopt the most reliable prevention and control methods for various chronic infectious diseases and gradually promote them. To do a good job in anti-epidemic work, we must proceed from reality and resolutely rely on the masses. Anti-epidemic work must go to disaster areas, rural areas, and border areas: wherever there are more infectious diseases, we must make breakthroughs there.
　　Before the closing of the conference, Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council, attended and made a report on current affairs and politics.
　　All the representatives at the conference expressed great indignation at the crimes of American imperialism in plotting to expand the war of aggression, shielding Japanese bacteriological war criminals, and secretly conducting bacteriological warfare research; they unanimously signed in support of concluding a peace treaty and voted against arming Japan.

　　全国防疫专业会议制定各种传染病防治方案
    保护人民健康保证国家生产和国防建设
    中央人民政府卫生部为研讨如何更好地防止全国各地传染病的发生，进一步保护人民健康，保证国家生产和国防建设，于四月十日至二十三日在北京召开了全国防疫专业会议。会议明确了今后防疫工作的方向，制定了各种危害最大的传染病的防治方案和“法定传染病管理条例草案”及关于防疫工作的规章制度等。
    出席会议的有各大行政区、省、市卫生机关防疫部门负责人员和全国各种传染病学专家共二百一十二人。
    中央人民政府卫生部李德全部长首先在会议上作了一九五○年全国防疫工作的总结报告。她指出：全国各地去年已基本上控制了传染病的流行，并曾大力开展了灾区卫生工作及开始了少数民族地区的防疫工作，成绩是空前巨大的。她又强调指出：团结中西医发动广大群众参加工作，和取得当地行政首长的重视，是防疫工作做出成绩的必要条件。
    会议按各种传染病、生物制品、防疫机构、防疫法规制度等分十一个组进行。各组首先广泛地交流了各地一年来的工作经验，提出典型报告，再归纳各地工作中的有效方法，参考苏联的先进经验，推定专家根据我国实际情况，起草了各种传染病的防治方案。
    经过各专家十余天的反复研讨，会议制定了鼠疫、霍乱、天花、白喉、斑疹伤寒、回归热、伤寒、痢疾、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、猩红热、麻疹、百日咳、疟疾、日本住血吸虫病、钩虫病、黑热病、结核病、麻疯病、性病等十九种传染病的防治方案，和“法定传染病管理条例草案”及关于防疫工作的规章制度等文件十四种。这些方案、条例都将由中央人民政府卫生部审核公布或呈报政务院批准后实施。
    会议由中央人民政府卫生部贺诚副部长作总结。他指出：在实现以“预防为主”的卫生工作方针下，在现阶段又应以防疫工作为中心。防疫工作今后的任务，首先是控制急性传染病，不使发生或流行，尤其不能让传染病影响到国家的生产和国防建设事业；就是说在经济命脉、国防前线、交通要道、政治中心等地区，应当首先防止霍乱、天花、鼠疫以及足以妨害那些地方的正常工作与生活秩序的疾病的发生和流行。我们对各种慢性传染病，要采用最可靠的防治方法，逐渐推广。防疫工作要作好必须从实际出发，并坚决依靠群众。防疫工作必须到灾区、农村和边疆去：那里传染病多就突破那里。
    会议闭幕前，政务院郭沫若副总理曾出席作了关于时事政治的报告。
    会议全体代表对美国帝国主义阴谋扩大侵略战争，包庇日本细菌战犯，秘密进行细菌战研究等罪恶行为表示了极大的愤慨；他们一致签名拥护缔结和平公约，并投票反对武装日本。
