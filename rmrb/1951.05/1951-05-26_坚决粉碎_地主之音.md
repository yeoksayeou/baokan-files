　　Resolutely Smash the "Voice of the Landlords"
    Shi Wenqi
    Land reform is a systematic and fierce class struggle. It aims to completely destroy the foundation of the feudal system that has lasted for three thousand years, transforming the landlord-ruled countryside into the peasants' own countryside, and turning feudal rule into a people's democratic dictatorship. In such a great, earth-shattering revolutionary movement, on the one hand, the peasants urgently demand land and the overthrow of the feudal rule oppressing them; on the other hand, the landlord class absolutely refuses to voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage, and will not easily relinquish its plundered political and economic privileges to the "slaves" who were originally oppressed and exploited by them. At this time of extreme tension in the class struggle, the "voice of the landlords," representing the ideological consciousness of the landlord class, is actually being broadcast and circulated everywhere. For example, some people say: "I completely agree with land reform in principle, but I don't think it's fair and reasonable to distribute the landlords' land, then scold them for exploitation, and then settle accounts and struggle against them. Because most landlords started their families through thrift and hard work. They used their savings to buy land, which is legal savings. If you don't believe me, look, those who waste money can't become landlords."
    Someone says: "Since it is said that feudal society is created by the feudal land system, then today when we carry out land reform, we only need the government to issue an order to let the landlords and peasants negotiate a solution, and let the landlords give the surplus land to the landless and land-poor peasants. Why must we mobilize the peasants to struggle? Because the peasants have too little knowledge, and the lower-level cadres cannot grasp the policies well. Once the struggle begins, deviations such as indiscriminate beating and killing will inevitably occur." Therefore, he believes that "in order to prevent these deviations, we must not mobilize the peasants to struggle against the landlords. It is best for the government to promulgate a detailed set of laws and train a group of intellectuals to handle this matter. Landlords should also be given democratic rights to discuss it with them properly."
    Still others say: "The rich peasant is also a product of feudal society, and his land property is also exploited. Why should the landlord class be eliminated, while the rich peasant economy should still be preserved? Moreover, the money exploited by the landlords, some bought land and some invested in industry and commerce; it was only a difference in thought at the time, but now the treatment is one for confiscation and one for protection, wouldn't that be unjust?" Therefore, he advocates: "It is best to adopt Sun Yat-sen's method of equalizing land rights, so that the landlords can take a sum of money from the government to buy their land and invest it in industry and commerce to develop industry and commerce; on the one hand, the landlords will suffer less grievances and pain, and on the other hand, the goal of 'land to the tiller' can still be achieved."
    Even more people say: "Although land reform is good, after the distribution, land and farming tools will be scattered. In addition, poor peasants and farm laborers lack the means of production, and idlers cannot engage in production diligently after getting land. Instead of doing this, it is better to take the road of agricultural capitalism, with landlords and peasants running cooperative farms, which is more beneficial to the development of production."
    The above-mentioned specious arguments, whether they come from the mouths of the landlord class and its "spokespersons," or from the mouths of intellectuals from the industrial and commercial sectors or the petty bourgeoisie, are in essence reflections of the decadent and declining landlord class consciousness. Although sometimes cloaked in the guise of reformism, spreading the idea of peaceful land reform, at their core, they are still counter-revolutionary theories that oppose land reform.
    It is not surprising that the landlord class and the "spokespersons" associated with the landlord class have ideas against land reform, because land reform is fundamentally detrimental to them. But the question is why some intellectuals from the industrial and commercial sectors and the petty bourgeoisie, even though they subjectively do not want to oppose land reform, are actually rebroadcasting the "voice of the landlords" and acting as the landlords' "spokespersons" without realizing it? Upon careful analysis, the following thoughts are at play:
    People who generally come from the declining feudal scholar-official class often retain reactionary orthodox ideas in their minds, and the idea of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is still deeply rooted in their minds. Therefore, they believe that landlords exploiting and enslaving peasants is a "truth" that is justified and will never change. It is clear that the peasants' blood and sweat support the landlords, but in their view, the reason why the peasants have food to eat is because of the landlords' land. It is clear that the working people create social wealth and culture and support the landlords' children to go to universities and study abroad, but they think that culture is the crystallization of feudal intellectuals, saying things like: "All other professions are inferior, only studying is noble." The land occupied by the landlords was clearly plundered and seized, but they say it is due to "outstanding people and fertile land," "loyalty and honesty passed down through generations," and "diligence and thrift." They act lawlessly, drinking people's marrow and blood, but slander the working people's poverty as being caused by not doing good deeds, having an impure heart, and divine retribution, and that they should honestly be beasts of burden and cultivate their next life. Because of this kind of thinking, they are unwilling to let the "slaves" who grew up flattering them point their fingers at their noses and call them by their names, forgetting to call them "Master"; they cannot stand the peasants running into their guest rooms and sitting on their "grand master chairs" without being summoned; even the peasants spitting in front of them is as uncomfortable as if they were stabbed in the eye. Therefore, they see land reform as "rebellion and chaos," "lawless," class struggle as "manufactured" by the Communist Party, the people's regime in the countryside as "villains in power," and cadres as "idlers." Their minds are filled with "punishments do not apply to high officials, and rituals do not apply to commoners"; they regard struggling against landlords as "treasonous" and "out of line"; they regard the peasants who were forced to death over the past few thousand years due to rent and debt as deserving of their fate, but when the peasants beat the landlords a few times at the struggle meeting today while recounting their grievances, they cry out in "rabbit dies, fox grieves" fashion, spreading everywhere that "cadres instructed the peasants to beat people," "land reform has deviations," and "the countryside is very chaotic!" attempting to confuse public opinion and undermine land reform.
    Secondly, there is the doctrine of the mean of "too much is as bad as too little" and "enough is enough." They believe that since the landlords' land has been divided, that should be enough. Why bother to scold them for exploitation and struggle against them in public? Those are excessive actions that go against the "way of the sages" or "humanitarianism." Therefore, they advocate being more lenient to the landlords, having good consultations with them, agreeing to adopt Sun Yat-sen's method of equalizing land rights, or advocating following the old areas' rent and interest reduction method during the Anti-Japanese War, and conducting landlord-tenant agreements in accordance with labor-capital agreements. In short, they want to find ways to make both landlords and peasants able to get by.
    There are also people with sentimentalism, who have not seen the true situation of landlords and bullies exploiting and oppressing peasants, and are often deceived by the "suffering faces" and "pitiful appearances" of landlords when they are struggled against by peasants, as well as the landlords' "complaints" and "pretending to be poor" (in Danyang County, southern Jiangsu, forty landlords came out to beg on the same day after the land reform), unconsciously expressing sympathy for them, and even feeling that the peasants' struggles are "too excessive," "too intense," and "too cruel."
    There are also bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals who have lived in cities for a long time, have been deceived by the reactionaries for a long time, and do not understand the true situation of the countryside at all. They do not have a sufficient understanding of the justice and necessity of land reform, and their understanding of land reform as a fierce class struggle is blurred, so they are easily confused by the "voice of the landlords," and thus develop all kinds of reformist and unrealistic fantasies. For example, some believe that China's poverty and weakness are mainly due to imperialist aggression, the corruption of the reactionary government, and the people's undisciplined nature, and have nothing to do with the landlord class; some believe that there is little land and many people in Jiangnan, and the landlords' exploitation of the peasants is "very light," and that methods such as relieving the peasants' suffering and developing production, or methods of solving land problems in Europe and the United States, such as implementing land ownership by villages, migrating to reclaim wasteland, promoting peasants' science and technology, establishing cooperative farms, colonizing overseas, and first reducing feudal exploitation and then implementing land nationalization in the future, can be used to move towards industrialization in a gentle and steady manner. Why must land reform be carried out?
    Even more, some are ambitious and are obsessed with large-scale agricultural economy and collective production, and therefore have doubts about the peasants cultivating on scattered and fragmented land after land reform. They believe that to develop productivity, it is necessary to develop large-scale agricultural economy and cooperative farms, and adopt machine production, while ignoring the actual situation of Chinese society, and fantasizing about achieving agricultural production collectivization in one fell swoop. Therefore, they want to use the landlord class to run cooperative farms, naively hoping that the country and the vast number of people will help them accomplish their "good deeds."
    In short, it is precisely because these thoughts have not been completely eradicated from people's minds that some industrialists, business people and intellectuals, and even individual revolutionary cadres, commit crimes that undermine the land reform. For example, the "Liberation Daily" published on January 23 the case of Ge Feng, secretary of the headquarters of the East China Air Force Preparatory Corps, who was arrested and punished for impersonating the name of the corps, threatening cadres and the masses, attempting to protect landlord relatives, and undermining land reform, which is a prominent example.
    In order to smoothly and thoroughly complete this great historical task, in addition to carrying out political, economic, and even armed struggles against the landlord class, we must also launch battles in ideology and theory, and we must completely smash the "voice of the landlords" and the toxins and influences of the "voice of the landlords" in our minds. This invisible ideological enemy lurking in our minds is even more difficult to guard against than the destructive acts of illegal landlords and bullies. We must strengthen our vigilance and improve our understanding in order to expose and eliminate the landlord class ideology buried in our minds.
    How can we arm our minds so that everyone will not only be confused, paralyzed, and poisoned by the "voice of the landlords," but also be able to further smash the "voice of the landlords"? Now I will write down my preliminary and incomplete experiences gleaned from learning:
    First, our understanding of land reform must start from the long-term interests of the entire country and the vast number of people to improve political consciousness and correct our own positions. The biggest stumbling block for some intellectuals is the selfish and individualistic thinking of the feudal ruling class. We must eradicate this kind of thinking before we can feel that the phenomenon of "one person fat and a thousand people thin" in the countryside is the root cause of China's long-term stagnation, backwardness, and poverty. To make China rich and strong, we must completely liberate the vast majority of China's peasant population in order to eliminate the ideology of reconciliation and reformism.
    Second, we must understand in principle that retaining the rich peasant economy and developing industry and commerce are for the purpose of improving productivity to develop the new democratic economy and transitioning to socialism in the future. Therefore, we must distinguish between enemies and friends, and treat different people within the landlord class differently, and not treat everyone the same.
    Third, many intellectuals, due to being in feudal society for a long time, are limited by the environment, so they cannot see the essence of the feudal system, just as "if you enter a stall selling abalone, you will not smell its odor after a long time." Therefore, we must thoroughly understand the evils of feudal exploitation by the landlord class and understand that the working people are the creators of all culture and wealth in society, in order to clear up erroneous views such as "landlords started their families through diligence and thrift," "collecting rent is to seek profit on the principal," "peasants rely on landlords for their livelihood," and "peasants' poverty is due to laziness and waste," and also to understand the justice of land reform.
    Fourth, we must trust the masses and believe in the power and wisdom of the masses. We must know that today's land reform, under the leadership of the proletariat, as long as we rely on the poor peasants and farm laborers, unite the middle peasants, and organize a united front against feudalism, we will definitely be able to defeat the landlord class and correctly implement the state's land policy. We should overcome the erroneous ideas of intellectuals who despise peasants, thinking that "peasants have low knowledge," "struggles have deviations," and sympathize with and pity landlords.
    Fifth, we must thoroughly understand that the elimination of feudalism can only be achieved by organizing the peasants to completely defeat the landlord class. The so-called landlord-tenant agreement, running cooperative farms, developing agricultural capitalism, and implementing equal land rights are all fantasies of the old democracy. The compromising methods of the old democracy cannot completely eliminate the feudal system, liberate the peasants, and develop production in China.
    Finally, every Chinese person can only eliminate all backward and decadent old ideas remaining in their minds on a conscious basis by using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only by correctly standing on the side of the people can we master the land reform policy, and all specific problems can be solved easily, and can we smoothly pass the "gate" of land reform.

　　坚决粉碎“地主之音”
    施文淇
    土地改革是一场系统的激烈的阶级斗争。它要彻底摧毁延续三千年来封建制度的基础，把地主统治的农村变为农民自己的农村，把封建的统治变为人民民主专政。在这样一个伟大的翻天覆地的革命运动中，一方面农民迫切要求土地，要求打倒压在他们头上的封建统治；而另一方面，地主阶级又绝不肯自动退出历史舞台，绝不轻易把他掠夺来的政治经济特权，让位给原来受他压迫和剥削的“奴隶”们。在这阶级斗争极为紧张的时候，那些代表地主阶级思想意识的“地主之音”，居然到处播送流传。譬如有些人说：“土地改革我在原则上完全同意，不过我认为分了地主们的田，又要骂他们剥削，又要清算斗争，似乎不大公平合理。因为地主们大都是靠平日省吃俭用勤俭起家的。他们把积蓄下来的钱去买田，这是合法的储蓄。不信你看，浪费的人成不了地主。”
    有人说：“既然说封建社会是封建土地制度所造成，那末我们今天进行土地改革，只要由政府下一道命令，让地主和农民们协商解决，把地主们多余的土地让给无地少地的农民好了，何必一定要发动农民来斗争呢？因为农民知识太低，下级干部又不能很好掌握政策，一斗起来必然要发生乱打乱杀等偏差。”所以他认为“为了防止这些偏差，决不能发动农民去斗争地主，最好由政府颁布一套详细的法令，训练一批知识分子去办理这件事。对地主也应给予民主权利，与他好好商量”。
    还有人说：“富农也是封建社会的产物，他的土地财产也是剥削来的，为什么地主阶级要消灭，富农经济仍要保存下来？而且同是地主剥削来的钱，有的买田，有的投资于工商业；当时只是一念之差，而现在的待遇一要没收，一要保护，岂不冤枉？”所以他主张：“最好采用孙中山先生平均地权的办法，一面可使地主拿政府向他收买土地的一笔钱，投资到工商业，去发展工商业；一面可使地主少受委屈、痛苦，且同样可以达到耕者有其田的目的。”
    更有人说：“土地改革虽好，但在分配之后，土地耕具反会零星分散。加以贫雇农缺少生产资料，二流子分得土地不能勤俭从事生产。与其这样，不如走农业资本主义道路，由地主和农民开办合作农场，这样对发展生产还有利得多。”
    上面这些似是而非的论调，不管它是出自地主阶级及其“代言人”的嘴里，或者是部分工商业者或小资产阶级出身的知识分子的口中，实质上都是腐朽没落的地主阶级意识的反映。虽然有时披上改良主义的外衣，传播着和平土地改革的思想，但骨子里仍还是反对土地改革的反革命理论。
    地主阶级以及和地主阶级有联系的“代言人”，他们存在着反对土地改革的思想毫不足怪，因土地改革根本就是对他们不利的。但问题在为什么有些工商业者和小资产阶级出身的知识分子，尽管他们主观上并不想反对土地改革，但实际上他们却在转播“地主之音”，当了地主的“代言人”还不自觉呢？仔细分析起来，有下面几种思想在作祟：
    一般出身于没落的封建士大夫阶级的人们，往往在思想上还残留着反动的正统思想。“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的想法在他们脑中还根深蒂固。因此他们认为地主剥削、奴役农民是天经地义万世不移的“真理”。明明是农民的血汗养活了地主，在他们看农民之所以有饭吃，是因为有了地主的土地。明明是劳动人民创造了社会财富和文化，并养活了地主的子女去上大学、留洋，在他们则认为文化是由封建的知识分子的结晶，说什么：“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”。地主占有的土地，明明是掠夺霸占来的，他们则说是由于“人杰地灵”、“忠厚传家”、“克勤克俭”所致。自己横行不法，喝人膏血，反而污蔑劳动人民穷困是因为没做好事、心不正、天报应，只有老老实实地当牛马、修来世。由于这种思想，他们是不甘心让捧牛屁股长大的“奴隶”，手指着他的鼻子叫他的名字，而忘记称他“大老爷”；他们看不惯农民不等他招唤，便跑进客房坐上他的“太师椅子”；甚至连农民在他面前吐一口痰，都像刺了他们的眼似地不舒服。因此他们把土地改革看作是“造反作乱”、“无法无天”，把阶级斗争看作是共产党“制造”的，把农村中的人民政权看作“小人当道”，把干部看作是“二流子”。他们装满了一脑子的“刑不上大夫，礼不下庶人”；他们把斗争地主看作是“大逆不道”，“不成体统”；他们把几千年来因欠租欠债而被他们逼死的农民们都视为罪所应得，然而在今天斗争会上农民在诉苦时打了地主几下，便“兔死狐悲”地大叫大嚷起来，到处传播“干部支使农民打人”啦，“土地改革有偏差”啦，“农村里乱得很！”啦，企图淆乱听闻，破坏土地改革。
    其次是“过犹不及”，“适可而止”的中庸思想。他们认为既然分了地主的田就算了，何必还要骂他们剥削，当众斗争他们，那都是过分的举动，是有背“圣贤之道”，或者“人道主义”的。因此他们主张对地主宽大一些，要和他们好好商量，赞成采用孙中山先生平均地权的办法，或者主张沿用抗日时期老区减租减息的办法，和仿劳资协议办法进行主佃协议。总之，他们要设法使地主和农民双方都过得去才好。
    还有一种是有着温情主义思想的人，他们没有看到地主和恶霸们剥削压榨农民的真实情况，往往给地主在被农民斗争时表现的那付“苦相”、“可怜相”以及地主们的“诉苦”、“装穷”（苏南丹阳县在土地改革后曾有四十个地主们同天出来讨饭）所欺蒙，不自觉地对他们表示同情，甚至于觉得农民们的斗争“太过火”、“太激烈”、“太残酷”了。
    还有一向生活在城市中的资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子，长期受着反动派的蒙蔽，加以自己根本不了解农村的真实情况，对土地改革的正义性必要性认识不够，对土地改革是个激烈的阶级斗争的认识模糊，所以很容易为“地主之音”所惑，因而发生种种改良主义的、脱离实际的空想来。如有的认为中国的贫弱主要的是由于帝国主义的侵略、反动政府的腐败、人民的散漫成性，而与地主阶级无关；有的认为江南地少人多，地主对农民的剥削又“很轻”，可用解除农民的痛苦，发展生产的办法，也可采用欧美解决土地问题的办法，如实行土地村有制、移民开荒、推广农民科学技术、举办合作农场、向海外殖民、以及先减轻封建剥削，将来实行土地国有等，温和稳健地走向工业化，何必一定要实行土地改革呢？
    更有的好高鹜远，醉心于大农经济和集体生产，因此对于土地改革后农民在分散的零星的土地上耕种发生怀疑。他们认为要发展生产力，必须发展大农经济、合作农场，采用机器生产，而无视于中国社会的实际情形，幻想一步登天地达到农业生产集体化的空想。因此他们想利用地主阶级开办合作农场，天真地希望国家和广大人民帮助他们成其“好事”。
    总之，正因为这些思想还没有彻底从人们的头脑中根除，往往使得一些工商业者和知识分子，甚至个别革命干部，做出破坏土地改革反革命的罪行来。例如，一月二十三日《解放日报》公布的华东空军预科总队司令部秘书葛风，因假冒该部名义，威胁干部和群众，企图包庇地主亲属，破坏土地改革被押制裁，就是一个显著的事例。
    我们为了顺利彻底地完成这个历史性的伟大任务，我们除了必须要和地主阶级展开政治、经济乃至武装等斗争外，还要在思想上理论上展开战斗，必须彻底粉碎“地主之音”以及“地主之音”在我们头脑中的毒素和影响。这种潜伏在我们脑中的无形的思想敌人，较之不法地主、恶霸的破坏行为还不易防范。我们必须加强警惕、提高认识，才能把埋伏在头脑中的地主阶级思想予以揭发、肃清。
    怎样才能把我们的头脑武装起来，使大家不但不会被“地主之音”所蛊惑、麻痹、毒害，且能进一步地去粉碎“地主之音”？现在我将个人在学习中摸索出来的初步的不完整的体验写在后面：
    第一，我们对土地改革的认识，必须要从整个国家和广大人民的长远利益出发，来提高政治觉悟，和端正自己的立场。障碍某些知识分子最大的绊脚石，是封建统治阶级的自私自利的个人主义思想。必须铲除了这种思想，才会感到在农村中“一人肥千人瘦”现象是中国社会长期停滞、落后、贫困的根源，要使中国富强，必须使中国占绝大多数的农民人口获得彻底解放，以肃清调和主义和改良主义的思想。
    第二，我们要从原则上去认识：保留富农经济和发展工商业是为的提高生产力以发展新民主主义经济，将来过渡到社会主义。因此必须分清敌友，对地主阶级内部不同人也要分别对待，不可头发胡子一把抓。
    第三，许多知识分子因长期处在封建社会，环境的限制，使他们看不到封建制度的实质，正所谓“如入鲍鱼之肆，久而不闻其臭”。所以必须彻底了解地主阶级封建剥削的罪恶，了解劳动人民是社会上一切文化和财富的创造者，才能扫清“地主是勤俭起家”、“收租是将本求利”、“农民靠地主生活”以及“农民贫困是由于懒惰浪费”等错误看法，也才能了解土地改革的正义性。
    第四，要相信群众，相信群众的力量与智慧。要知道今天的土地改革，在无产阶级的领导下，只要依靠贫雇农、团结中农、组织了反封建的统一战线，就一定能战胜地主阶级，而且能正确执行国家的土地政策。应克服知识分子轻视农民认为“农民知识低”、“斗争有偏差”以及同情怜悯地主等错误思想。
    第五，要彻底明了消灭封建，只有组织起农民彻底打垮地主阶级才能实现。所谓以主佃协议、办理合作农场、发展农业资本主义、实行平均地权等，都是旧民主主义的幻想。旧民主主义的妥协的办法，在中国是不可能彻底消灭封建制度，解放农民，发展生产的。
    最后一点，就是每个中国人民，只有在自觉的基础上，以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想作为武器，展开批评与自我批评，才能消除残存在脑中的一切落后、腐朽的旧思想。只有正确地站在人民的立场上，才能学通土地改革政策，一切具体问题也才能迎刃而解，也才能顺利地通过土地改革这一“关”。
