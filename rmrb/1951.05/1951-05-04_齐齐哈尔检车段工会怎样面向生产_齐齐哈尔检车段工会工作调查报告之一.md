　　How the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Depot Trade Union Faces Production
　　——Investigation Report on the Work of the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Depot Trade Union (Part 1)
　　　　　　Chen Ji
　　From 1947 to today, the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Depot Trade Union has cultivated Wang Xuezeng, the first special-class labor model in Northeast Railway, and more than 40 worker cadres at or above the主任 (zhǔrèn - director) level. In 1950, the depot completed its annual task 46 and a half days ahead of schedule, creating a rare record of 264 accident-free days for the entire depot, saving 3.9 billion yuan (Northeast currency), and winning the title of "Model Depot."
　　These brilliant achievements are inseparable from the trade union's focus on production. Since its establishment in 1946, the depot's trade union has never neglected production work, and has launched a series of labor model movements, merit-seeking movements, and "Iron Ox" movements, which have played a significant role in improving production efficiency, reducing costs, and safely completing national transportation tasks. After the Northeast Railway Trade Union convened a trade union work conference in October 1949 and established the policy of "trade unions facing production," the depot trade union's ideology of focusing on production became clearer, and as a result, it achieved even greater success. It is precisely for this reason that the depot trade union has always been a model trade union for Northeast Railway.
　　Turning Administrative Production Plans into Mass Plans
　　How does the depot trade union face production? The first step is to turn the administrative production plans into the masses' own plans. Whenever the depot trade union learns of the administrative production tasks, it convenes a trade union committee meeting to discuss and formulate a work plan to guarantee the completion of the administrative production tasks. It also convenes a joint meeting of trade union group leaders to convey the trade union's guarantee plan. The group leaders bring this plan to their respective groups, convene group meetings to discuss and formulate group plans to guarantee the completion of the production plan. Each individual must also formulate a personal plan to guarantee the realization of the group plan. Last September, the depot director received a task from higher authorities – a major task requiring the saving of 1 billion yuan (Northeast currency) within one month. At that time, everyone lacked confidence. At this time, the trade union convened a trade union committee meeting, discussed and drafted a preliminary plan to guarantee the saving of 1 billion yuan, and handed it over to the groups for discussion. The groups discussed and drafted group saving plans, and individuals also drafted personal saving plans. As a result, the depot saved 1.38 billion yuan by the end of September.
　　Consulting the Masses on Everything
　　During the development of production competitions, shortcomings in production management are often exposed, and it is necessary to rely on the masses to correct these shortcomings in order to ensure the normal development of the competition movement. At the end of 1949, the depot experienced a serious phenomenon of overtime work, which affected the workers' health. After seeing this deviation, the trade union cadres discussed it with the administrative cadres. But the administrative cadres thought: "There's been overtime for a long time, how can we solve it?" The trade union chairman thought: I should consult with the masses. So he spent an hour every day going to the repair shop to specifically study the production process, and consulted with veteran workers several times. After five days of investigation, he discovered that the main reason for overtime was poor production management: the repair shop director and foreman did not grasp the plan, work was slack in the morning, and tasks were piled up in the afternoon. When it got dark, the foreman was anxious: "Hurry up! Otherwise, we'll have to work overtime again!" Secondly, the materials prepared by the warehouse were not complete, resulting in work stoppages waiting for materials. Thirdly, the division of labor among the leaders was not clear, and there was no communication between the groups. The trade union presented these specific opinions of the masses to the administration. Although the administrative cadres were still skeptical, the specific facts convinced them. When the depot director began to change these unreasonable phenomena in production, the trade union chairman called on everyone: "Work harder in the morning to avoid being slack at the beginning and rushed at the end, and strengthen the connection between the groups." This fundamentally eliminated the phenomenon of overtime and improved work efficiency, enabling the production competition to develop normally. As a result, the workers' morale rose, and they said: "Without overtime, we can actually do more work!" The administrative cadres were also happy: "If the trade union hadn't mobilized the workers, how could we have eliminated overtime!" Since 1950, the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Depot has never again experienced overtime due to defects in production management.
　　Grasping the Key Issues in Production
　　Grasping the key issues in production is an important experience of the depot trade union in leading production competitions. Last February, the depot had frequent accidents, which was severely criticized by higher authorities and greatly affected the workers' production morale. The train attendants were full of a pessimistic mood of "listening to fate." Every time they went out to inspect the train, their hearts would jump, fearing an accident. The trade union cadres talked to them, and they said: "Axle overheating will cause accidents, what can we do?" The trade union chairman thought: If the "axle overheating" problem is solved, wouldn't the accident problem be solved too? He went to experienced veteran workers, technicians, and engineers to study how to eliminate "axle overheating." Everyone put forward more than 20 suggestions, pointing out the causes of axle overheating and the ways to overcome them. After these methods were adopted and implemented by the administration, accidents caused by "axle overheating" no longer occurred. The trade union seized on this point and educated the workers: "The most difficult enemy to eliminate—axle overheating—has also been eliminated! What other accidents can't we eliminate?" This gave the workers confidence in eliminating accidents. The trade union also convened a meeting of technicians to analyze all past accidents and find the root cause of the accidents: "Irresponsibility." The trade union, centering on this, carried out a series of work. The trade union called on workers to launch an "accident root-digging" movement, so that workers could find the root causes of accidents themselves and automatically overcome them. All depot workers discussed the topic "Why do accidents happen? How can we prevent accidents from happening?" After half a month of discussion and research, the workers also knew that "accidents are enemies, and they are the result of irresponsibility." After veteran worker Zhang Youheng got off work and went home, he was about to rest when he suddenly suspected: "Did I really close all the axle box doors that I was responsible for closing today?" He couldn't rest assured, so he ran out of his house, ran more than half a mile, and rushed to the scene to inspect the axle boxes. Seeing that the axle box doors were all closed, he felt relieved. Because the trade union grasped the key issues in production and educated the masses to work conscientiously and responsibly, the entire depot did not have a single accident in 264 days, and received awards from the Railway Administration four times in a row.
　　Conducting Ideological Education Anytime, Anywhere
　　Grasping the masses' thinking and conducting timely education is an important weapon for the depot trade union in leading the production competition movement. The chairman of the depot trade union said: "Without clearing the masses' thinking, don't even think about doing a good job in production." Last year, when the depot launched an ideological education campaign of "practicing thrift and establishing an economic accounting perspective," some workers reflected: "It's enough to complete the task, why do we need to carry out ideological education on economic accounting!" In response to this idea, the trade union promptly educated everyone with various typical facts. Passenger car cleaning workers used oil to scrub the car skins, which took a lot of effort and made the cars shiny, which made everyone very happy. However, as soon as the car was driven out, the dust quickly mixed with the oil on the car skin, resulting in a waste of 100 catties of oil. The workers were also tired, and the car skin was not clean. In order to pursue quantity, the repair shop even overhauled vehicles that were not due for repair in order to complete the production figures. This phenomenon of pursuing quantity greatly wasted the state's resources. After hearing these facts, the workers realized the harm of "completing tasks without considering costs." From then on, the workers actively responded to the trade union's call and launched a "anti-waste, more-saving" movement, saving a large amount of financial resources for the state and laying an ideological foundation for the depot to implement the economic accounting system.
　　Last July, the depot had gone 150 days without accidents, and some workers developed a sense of pride and complacency. They said: "We've passed the 150-day hurdle, what's there to be afraid of?" Production morale gradually slackened, and phenomena that violated labor discipline also appeared. Some workers slept during work hours, and some were even late for seven or eight days in a row. Seeing this situation, the trade union quickly convened a joint meeting of group leaders to discuss this issue. The trade union used various facts to illustrate "pride makes one backward" and decided to launch a "observe discipline, check errors" movement to consolidate the existing achievements. Each workshop in the entire depot had a "black and red dot" wooden board, and anyone who was late had a black dot marked next to their name. Each workshop also had an "error stand," and anyone who made a mistake at work had their name put on the "error stand." Every month, the trade union checked these "black and red dots" and "error stands" as one of the criteria for judging competition results. This reversed the lax phenomenon that had occurred in the depot and consolidated production achievements.
　　Closely Caring for Workers' Lives and Difficulties
　　Caring for and solving workers' difficulties is an important task of the depot trade union. The trade union cadres said: "If you don't ask about the difficulties of the workers in production, and just want the workers to produce more, that's terrible!" If the workers lack tools, the trade union will immediately suggest that the administration take care of it. The more than 30 apprentices in the train inspection station did not have leather overcoats, and they could not work in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. After the trade union discovered this problem, it discussed it with the administration. The administration did have difficulties: "Where can we get the money to buy more than 30 leather overcoats?" The trade union discussed it with the workers at the train inspection station, and the workers who had leather overcoats voluntarily proposed a "rotating wearing leather overcoats" solution, which solved the difficulties for the more than 30 apprentices, enabling the station's production work to proceed smoothly and becoming one of the "winning models" of the entire depot.
　　The Results of "Facing Production"
　　Because the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Depot Trade Union truly implemented the policy of facing production, it ensured the completion of production tasks. Not only did it put the trade union work on the right track, but it also strengthened the relationship between the administration and the trade union, making the administrative cadres sincerely willing to rely on the trade union. The depot director said: "Without the trade union, nothing can be done well." Therefore, the administrative cadres attached great importance to the trade union work and vigorously helped the trade union. This also gave strong support to the trade union work. Every time the trade union issued a call, the administrative cadres were the first to respond. The trade union called on all employees to do work for the families of workers who volunteered to go to Korea, and the administrative cadres took the lead in doing so. The administrative cadres did their best to solve the trade union's material difficulties, such as office supplies, propaganda boards, clubs, etc. The administrative cadres also always tried to solve the difficulties of the trade union cadres in their work. For example, when a trade union committee member had urgent trade union work that required them to leave the site, some foremen would discuss it with the workers and take over the production tasks of the trade union committee member. The trade union committee members happily said: "If everyone helps our trade union cadres like this, how can we not do a good job in the trade union?" The administrative cadres of the depot also actively participated in the trade union work, and the depot director once served as a production committee member of the trade union.

　　齐齐哈尔检车段工会怎样面向生产
    ——齐齐哈尔检车段工会工作调查报告之一
         陈迹
    从一九四七年到今天，齐齐哈尔检车段工会培养了东北铁路第一个特等劳动模范王学增，和四十多名主任级以上的工人干部。一九五○年该段提前四十六天半完成全年任务，创造全段二百六十四天无事故的罕有纪录，节省了三十九亿元（东北币），荣获了“模范段”的称号。
    这些辉煌的成绩，是和该段工会面向生产分不开的。一九四六年该段工会成立以后，从来就没有忽视过生产工作，曾经发动工人群众开展过一连串的劳动模范运动、立功运动、铁牛运动，对于提高生产效率、降低成本、安全地完成国家运输任务，起了重大的保证作用。一九四九年十月东北铁路工会召开工会工作会议，确立“工会面向生产”的方针之后，该段工会面向生产的思想更为明确，因此，获得了更大的成绩。也正因此，该段工会始终是东北铁路的模范工会。
  把行政的生产计划变为群众自己的计划
    该段工会是怎样面向生产的呢？首先就是把行政的生产计划变为群众自己的计划。每当该段工会知道了行政的生产任务后，就召开工会委员会议，讨论和制订保证完成行政生产任务的工作计划。并召开工会小组长联席会议，传达工会的保证计划。小组长把这一计划带到小组内，召开小组会议，讨论并制订保证完成生产计划的小组计划。每一个人还要制订保证实现小组计划的个人计划。去年九月，该段段长接到上级给的任务——要求在一个月内节约十亿元（东北币）的重要任务，当时大家没有信心。这时，工会召开工会委员会议，讨论并拟订了保证节约十亿元的初步计划，交给小组讨论，小组讨论并拟订了小组节约计划，个人也拟订了个人节约计划。结果，该段在九月底竟节约了十三亿八千万元。
  遇事和群众商量
    在开展生产竞赛时，常常会暴露出生产管理上的缺点，必须依靠群众来纠正这些缺点，才能保证竞赛运动的正常发展。一九四九年年底该段曾发生严重的加班加点现象，影响了工人的身体健康。工会干部看到这种偏向后就和行政干部商量。行政干部却认为：“早就加班加点了，怎么解决呢？”工会主席想：还是找群众商量。于是他就每天抽出一小时，到修车场具体地研究生产过程，并几次找老工人商量。经过五天的调查，他发现了加班加点的原因主要是生产管理不善：修车场主任、工长不掌握计划，上午工作松懈，把任务都堆到下午来干，天黑了，工长干着急：“快干呵！不然，又要加班加点啦！”其次是仓库准备的材料不周全，以致形成停工待料。再次是领导干部分工不明确，各组之间又互不联系。工会把群众的这些具体意见，向行政上提出。行政干部虽然还怀疑，但具体的事实说服了他们。段长着手改变这些生产上不合理的现象时，工会主席号召大家：“上午多干活，避免前松后紧，加强各组的联系。”这样就根本消灭了加班加点的现象，并提高了工作效率，使生产竞赛正常地开展起来。这样，工人情绪高起来了，说：“不加班加点，干活反而多了！”行政干部也高兴：“要不是工会发动工人，怎能消灭加班加点现象呢！”从一九五○年起，齐齐哈尔检车段再也没有因生产管理上的缺陷而引起加班加点的现象。
  抓住生产中的关键问题
    抓住生产中的关键问题，是该段工会领导生产竞赛的一个重要经验。去年二月该段经常出事故，受到上级的严厉批评，大大地影响了工人生产情绪。乘务员中充满了“听天由命”的悲观情绪，一出去检车，心就蹦蹦地跳，只怕出事故。工会干部找他们谈话，他们说：“燃轴，就得出事故，那有啥办法？”工会主席心里想：要是把“燃轴”解决了，事故问题岂不好解决了么？他便去找有经验的老工人，技术人员和工程师研究如何消灭“燃轴”。大家提了二十多条意见，指出车轴发热的原因和克服的办法。这些办法被行政采纳实行后，果然因“燃轴”而引起的事故就不再发生了。工会抓住了这一点，对工人进行教育：“最难消灭的敌人——燃轴，也给消灭啦！咱们还有什么不可消灭的事故呢？”这样就使得工人们对消灭事故有了信心。工会又召集技术人员开会，分析过去所有的事故，找出了发生事故的根本原因：“不负责”。工会围绕这个中心，又做了一连串的工作。工会号召工人开展“事故挖根”运动，使工人自己找出事故的根源，自动地去克服。全段工人都以“为什么发生事故？怎样才能不发生事故”为题进行讨论。经过半个月的讨论和研究，工人们也都知道了“事故——就是敌人，就是不负责的结果。”老工友张有恒下班回家，正想休息，忽然怀疑：“今天咱负责关的轴箱门究竟都关了没有？”他放心不下，连忙从家里跑出来，跑了一里多路，赶到现场，检查了轴箱，看见轴箱门都关上了，他心里才踏实了。因为工会抓住了生产中的关键问题，教育群众认真负责地工作，在二百六十四天内全段未发生一件事故，连续四次得到铁路管理局的奖励。
  随时随地进行思想教育
    掌握群众思想，及时地进行教育，是该段工会领导生产竞赛运动的一个重要武器。该段工会主席说：“不打通群众思想，休想搞好生产。”去年该段开展“厉行节约，树立经济核算观点”的思想教育时，有些工人反映：“完成任务就得了呗，还搞啥经济核算思想教育！”工会针对这种思想，及时地以各种典型事实教育大家。客车清扫工人用油擦洗车皮，费了很大力气，把车子擦亮了，大家很高兴。但车子一开出去，灰尘很快地和车皮上的油混在一起，结果是浪费了一百斤油，工人也受了累，车皮反而不干净。修车场为了追求数量，竟把没有到期的车辆，进行检修，以完成生产数字。这种追求数量的现象，大大地浪费了国家的资财。工人们听到了这些事实，从思想上认识了“完成任务不计成本”的危害性。从此，工人就积极响应工会的号召，开展“反浪费，多节约”运动，为国家节省了大批财力，替该段实行经济核算制打下了思想基础。
    去年七月该段已有一百五十天无事故，有些工人便产生了骄傲自满的情绪，他们说：“一百五十天的关，都闯过去了，还怕什么？”生产情绪渐渐松懈，违犯劳动纪律的现象也出现了，有些工人在工作时间内睡觉，甚至一连七、八天都迟到。工会看到这种情况，赶忙召开小组长联席会，讨论这个问题。工会以各种事实来说明“骄者必败”，并决定开展“守纪律、查错误”运动，以巩固既有的成绩。全段每个车间都挂有“黑红点”木板一块，谁迟到，谁的名字上面就记上个黑点。每个车间，又有一座“错误台”，谁在工作上有了错误，谁的名字就上了“错误台”。每隔一月，工会检查这些“黑红点”和“错误台”，作为评判竞赛成绩的标准之一。这样就扭转了该段一度发生的松懈现象，巩固了生产成绩。
  密切关心工人的生活和困难
    关心和解决工人的困难，是该段工会的重要任务。工会干部说：“不问工人生产上的困难，只要工人多生产，那就糟罗！”工人缺少工具，工会知道了，马上就建议行政去办。列车检查所三十多个学徒工没有皮大衣，在严寒的零下三十度的天气里，不能工作。工会发现了这一问题后就和行政商量。行政上确也有困难：“三十多件皮大衣，那来钱买？”工会又找列车检查所工人商量，有皮大衣的工人们自动提出了“轮穿皮大衣”的办法，给三十多个学徒工解决了困难，使该所生产工作得以顺利进行，并成为全段的“优胜模范”之一。
  “面向生产”的结果
    由于齐齐哈尔检车段工会真正实现了面向生产的方针，保证了生产任务的完成。不仅使工会工作走上轨道，而且更密切了行政与工会的关系，使得行政干部衷心愿意依靠工会。该段段长说：“没有工会，啥事也干不好。”所以行政干部对于工会工作十分重视，大力地帮助工会，这样也使工会工作得到了有力的支持。工会每一次发出号召，行政干部首先响应。工会号召全体职工替志愿赴朝鲜的工人家属做工作，行政干部带头去做。对于工会物质上的困难，如办公室用具、宣传板、俱乐部等等，行政干部无不尽力解决。对于工会干部工作中的困难，行政干部也总设法解决。比如工会委员有了紧急的工会工作，不能不离开现场时，有些工长就和工人商量，把工会委员的生产任务给代做了。工会委员高兴地说：“大伙儿这样帮助咱工会干部，咱还能不做好工会工作？”该段的行政干部也积极参加工会工作，段长就曾担任过工会生产委员。
