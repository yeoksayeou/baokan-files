　　Doctor Wu Yingkai Breaks Free from American Influence
	Jin Feng
　　Doctor Wu Yingkai has changed, everyone who knows him says so.

　　In early April this year, the faculty, students, and staff of Peking Union Medical College in Beijing welcomed Doctor Wu, who had returned from participating in the Beijing Volunteer Surgical Team. Standing on the stage, he happily reported: "Technique must serve politics, everything for resisting America and aiding Korea, everything for the wounded and sick!"

　　After the liberation of Peiping in 1949, the Rockefeller family, an American financial magnate, still tightly controlled Peking Union Medical College and Hospital with its annual funding of 600,000 US dollars. Every week, the college had to write a work report in English to New York. The representative of the Rockefeller Foundation in China, an American named Loucks, was the true owner of the medical college and hospital. The staff's salaries were calculated in US dollars, and the college was still full of English notices and official documents.

　　Wu Yingkai, a thoracic specialist who had been sent to the United States for advanced studies by Peking Union, and who returned to teach and work as a doctor at Peking Union, could not admit that the United States was an imperialist country after liberation. Acheson's White Paper was his first lesson. Doctor Wu Yingkai initially believed that Marshall's coming to China to "mediate" and "visiting Lushan seven times" was entirely out of good intentions. Only recently did he realize that this "peace envoy" sent by the United States was actually secretly transporting troops and supporting Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out a counter-revolutionary civil war! He had to admit: there was imperialist behavior in the United States. Truman's statement on June 27, 1950, was his second lesson. The American fleet came to Taiwan, and MacArthur attacked Korea. He painfully saw that the United States, which he had always admired, was becoming more and more like the German and Japanese fascist bandits he hated.

　　In a discussion, he listened to the debate over whether to ignore it and how to deal with it legally. He suddenly stood up and said: If it's a robber, you can only fight him! You can't let the thief in the door, you should keep him out!

　　On October 1st last year, he participated in the parade for the first time and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"

　　Austin gave him his third lesson. Just as he still regarded "Peking Union" as an "exception" to American imperialist aggression, Austin unceremoniously listed "Peking Union" as an instrument of aggression cultivated by the United States in the United States. Doctor Wu Yingkai was indignant at being deceived and misled! He no longer regretted his time, and participated in the marches of church schools in Beijing against Austin's insults and slanders, and the patriotic demonstrations of the medical and health circles in Beijing to resist America and aid Korea, again and again.

　　When he heard the United States announce the freezing of Chinese deposits and remittances in the United States and the People's Government's preparation to take over Peking Union, he felt a sense of sadness and joy, like a child without a mother finally returning to his mother's arms. At this moment, he heard the news of the organization of the second batch of volunteer surgical teams in Beijing. He immediately signed up to participate. Seventeen doctors, nurses, and assistants from Peking Union participated at the same time.

　　When they arrived at the front, the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army cheered to them: "Chairman Mao has sent the surgical team!" Doctor Wu Yingkai looked at their trusting and grateful eyes and thought: "This is gratitude for Chairman Mao!" Only then could he understand the flesh-and-blood relationship between himself and the leader and the masses of the people.

　　When performing surgery, he saw the painful bodies of the soldiers, destroyed and twisted by American heavy weapons, and he specifically experienced the barbarity and ugliness of American imperialism. But our soldiers did not utter a sound about their pain, but loudly cursed the American imperialists who cruelly ravaged the Korean people. "You have airplanes," one soldier said contemptuously, "We have anti-aircraft guns to shoot you down, and air-raid shelters to hide in." "Tanks, what's that," another soldier interjected, "Climb up and open the lid, it's convenient to capture prisoners; treat you to a grenade and make you lie on your back!" Looking at these optimistic, fearless, and selfless soldiers, Doctor Wu Yingkai felt proud and even more responsible, thinking: "We must cure these most outstanding people in humanity!"

　　There, Doctor Wu Yingkai was very busy. He had to perform surgery, contact various relevant departments, and visit other fraternal surgical teams. However, he felt that these were the most meaningful days of his life. He also saw the difficulties of working conditions at the front, especially the lack of medical personnel. He couldn't help but ask himself: Where are the achievements of China's decades of medical education?

　　"Our teaching and work can no longer be obsessed with the Americanized standards of the past," Doctor Wu Yingkai shouted at the school-wide meeting, "I think 'solving the problem' is the highest standard. We must break away from the rigid formalism of the American shell. Resolutely and thoroughly improve medical education and train a large number of cadres!"

　　For six months, Doctor Wu Yingkai has been constantly moving forward. It has been hard and also happy. There are still difficulties. Recently, he was troubled by the fact that he had too many meetings (he gave four reports on the volunteer surgical team), and he had almost no time to read books. Sometimes he was very anxious and couldn't help but yell: "Meetings every day, not turning a single page of a book, it's terrible!" But after thinking about it for a day, he felt that he was impatient. He calmed down and thought: "To participate in political activities, you must squeeze out some time for technical work. Frontline soldiers sacrifice their lives, how can I be reluctant to give up even this little bit? What's more, with improved political awareness, technology will develop better." He looked at the notice of the Chinese Medical Association's signing and voting meeting to support the conclusion of the peace treaty and oppose the United States' arming of Japan, allocated his time, and began to prepare his report at this meeting.

### 吴英恺大夫摆脱了美国影响

　　吴英恺大夫摆脱了美国影响
     金凤
    吴英恺大夫变了，知道他的人谁都这样说。
    今年四月初，北京中国协和医学院的师生员工欢迎着参加北京志愿手术队归来的吴大夫。他站在台上高高兴兴报告着：“技术要服从政治，一切为了抗美援朝，一切为了伤病员！”
    一九四九年北平解放以后，美国大财阀洛克菲勒家族每年出的六十万元美金，还是紧紧控制了协和医学院和医院。每星期，院方要用英文向纽约写一份工作报告，洛氏基金社在中国的代表——美国人娄克斯，是医学院和医院的真正主人。工作人员的薪金用美金计算，院中依然满布英文的布告、公文。
    从协和保送到美国进修，回来以后在协和教书、当大夫成为胸科专家的吴英恺，解放以后，他还不能承认美国是帝国主义。艾奇逊的白皮书对他是第一课。吴英恺大夫最初认为马歇尔来中国“调停”，“七上庐山”，完全是一片好心。只等到最近，他才了解原来暗地运兵，一手扶植蒋介石进行反人民的内战的，都是这位美国派来的“和平特使”！他不得不承认：美国存在着帝国主义行为。一九五○年六月二十七日杜鲁门的声明，对他是第二课。美国的舰队开到台湾来了，麦克阿瑟进攻朝鲜。他痛心地看到：一向他所崇拜的美国，愈来愈像他所痛恨的德国和日本法西斯强盗了。
    在一次讨论会上，他听着在争辩是不是应该置之不理，以及如何理法。他猝然站起来说：是强盗，只有和它干！不能闭门纳盗，应该拒之门外！
    去年十月一日，他第一次参加了游行，喊出了“毛主席万岁！”
    奥斯汀给他上了第三课。正当他还把“协和”当做美帝国主义侵略的“例外”，奥斯汀在美国却不客气地把“协和”列为美国培养的侵略工具。吴英恺大夫因为自己的受蒙蔽、受欺骗而愤慨！他再不可惜自己的时间，一次、又一次，他参加了北京市教会学校反奥斯汀侮辱、诽谤的游行，北京市医药卫生界抗美援朝爱国示威大游行。
    当他听到美国宣布冻结中国在美的存款和汇兑和人民政府准备接管协和，他心里浮泛起一种又心酸又欢喜的感觉，像是没娘的孩子终于回到母亲的怀里来一样。就在这时，他听到组织北京市第二批志愿手术队的消息。他立刻报名参加。同时参加的协和医生、护士、助理员有十七人。
    到了前方，志愿军伤病员向他们欢呼着：“毛主席派来了手术队！”吴英恺大夫看着他们信任的感激的目光，他想：“这是对于毛主席的感激！”他这才能够理解自己和领袖、和人民群众的血肉关系。
    在做手术时候，他看到战士的被美国重武器所损毁、所扭曲的痛苦的躯体，他才具体体会到了美帝国主义的野蛮和丑恶。但是我们的战士对自己的痛苦不啃一声，却高声咒骂着残忍地糟蹋朝鲜老百姓的美帝国主义。“你有飞机”，一个战士轻蔑地说：“咱有高射炮干你下来，有防空壕隐蔽起来。”“坦克，又算什么”，另外的战士接口说：“爬上去揭盖，抓俘虏方便；请你吃颗手榴弹，叫你四脚朝天！”看着这些乐观、无畏、忘我的战士，吴英恺大夫带着骄傲也带着更大的责任感想着：“一定要治好这些人类中最优秀的人！”
    在那里，吴英恺大夫很忙。他要做手术，要到各有关部门联络，还要到别的兄弟手术队参观。但是，他觉得，这是他一生中最有意义的日子。他也看到前方工作条件的艰难，特别是医护人员的缺乏。他不由得问自己：中国几十年来医药教育的成就在那里？
    “我们的教学和工作不能再留恋过去的美国化的标准”，在全校大会上吴恺英大夫大声疾呼着：“我看‘解决了问题’就是最高的标准。我们要从美国那死硬的形式主义的外壳中脱出来。坚决、彻底改进医学教育，大批培养干部！”
    六个月来，吴英恺大夫不断地往前走着。走得很辛苦，也很愉快。困难，也还是有的。最近，他就为了开会太多（关于志愿手术队的报告，他就做了四次），几乎没有时间翻书而苦恼。有时他十分着急，不由己就嚷：“天天开会，不翻一页书，不得了！”但是过一天想想，又觉得自己急躁不对。他平心静气想：“要参加政治活动，就必定要挤出一部分搞技术的时间。前线战士连性命都牺牲，我难道连这点都舍不得。何况，提高了政治认识，技术会有更好开展。”他看了看中华医学会拥护缔结和平公约、反对美国武装日本签名、投票大会的通知，把时间分配了一下，动手准备起在这个大会上的报告。
