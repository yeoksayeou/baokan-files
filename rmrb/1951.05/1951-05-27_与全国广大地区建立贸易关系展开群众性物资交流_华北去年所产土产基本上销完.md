Establishing Trade Relations with Vast Areas of the Country and Launching Mass Commodity Exchange
North China Basically Sells Out Agricultural Products Produced Last Year

Since the Second North China Native Products Conference was held in late March, the promotion of native products in the North China region has been more widely developed. So far, various types of native products produced in the region in 1950 have been basically sold out, and many types of native products are in short supply. Currently, each province is preparing to hold a native product planning conference to study and formulate a production and sales plan for native products in 1951, in order to promote this work more systematically, planned, and regularly.

Dispatching Native Product Visiting Groups to Establish Trade Relations with Other Regions Extensively

The most significant feature of the North China's native product promotion work during this period is the extensive establishment of trade relations with other regions, which has made the exchange of native products between vast regions more active. Since March, provinces and cities in North China have successively organized native product visiting groups with the participation of public and private representatives, and went to East China, Central South, Northwest, and Northeast for visits. In order to promote the native products of North China in a comprehensive and planned manner, the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specially organized the North China Native Product Visiting Group, which departed on May 22 to visit Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. In addition to introducing the native products of the region, understanding the native products of friendly regions, and signing contracts and agreements with friendly regions to establish business relationships such as buying, selling, and consignment, the visiting groups also participated in native product exhibitions held by friendly regions. The Beijing Municipal Industry and Commerce Visiting Group exhibited special handicrafts, prepared medicines, and local food products at the Hangzhou Native Products Exhibition, all of which opened up excellent sales channels. The Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also specially sent a visiting group to participate in the Hunan Provincial Native Products Exhibition. During the visit, five agreements were signed to transport Hunan's special products such as rain gear, ramie cloth, and palm rope to North China, and to sell North China's famous products such as red dates, cottonseed, and medicinal materials to Hunan. A North-South medicinal material conference was held in Tianjin in April, with representatives from major administrative regions participating. A total of 115 contracts and agreements were signed, selling more than 1.6 million catties of medicinal materials, worth 7 billion yuan.

Dispatching Permanent Groups is an Effective Way to Open Up Sales Channels in Remote Areas

Sending out permanent sales groups is an effective way to open up sales channels in remote areas. The Shanxi Provincial Native Products Company formed five groups with eleven cadres, stationed in Shanghai, Hankou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Suiyuan, and other places, and sold 2.4 million catties of various native products within two months, creating a new record for Shanxi's native product promotion. The Beijing Private Knitwear Industry Joint Sales Group went to Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, and other places in Northeast China in March, and all the goods they brought were sold out, and order contracts were established. After opening up sales channels in the Northeast, the joint organization immediately assigned dedicated personnel to be stationed in Shenyang and other places. The Special Handicraft Industry Joint Venture went to Dalian, which was very popular, and has established a consignment relationship with the Soviet Qiulin Company to transport special handicrafts to the Soviet Union.

Overcoming Biases, Valuing Remote Areas, and Promoting Promotion Work

The biases of "emphasizing plains and neglecting mountains," "emphasizing large commodities and neglecting small commodities," and "emphasizing popular goods and neglecting unpopular goods" have been fundamentally overcome in the promotion campaign during this period. State-owned native product companies, all-inclusive companies, or warehouses have begun to be established in remote areas. Baiyangdian, a famous aquatic product area in Jizhong (in Anxin County, Hebei), can produce 18 million catties of fish and shrimp, 200,000 catties of water caltrop, 60,000 catties of white lotus root, 100,000 catties of egg rice, and 800,000 duck eggs every year. In the past, because there was no national trade organization to lead the operation, the sales were very abnormal; also, 4-5 million catties of reed mats can be produced every year, and the sales are very fast, but because the raw material for weaving reed (reed grass) is insufficient, it cannot be fully produced, and there was also a lack of sufficient strength to solve it in the past. Now the Hebei Provincial Cooperative has organized cooperatives specializing in the fish industry and reed mats in the area, and established aquatic product processing factories. In this way, the local market is controlled and the long-term interests of the fishermen are guaranteed. The fishermen in the entire area fully support it. There are more than 500 raw and cooked iron furnaces in the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area of Shanxi Province, with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons of various iron products. Historically, the sales were very wide, but because the funds for operating iron products were weak (the original six private iron product warehouses could only purchase the products of 60 iron furnaces), the production situation was very abnormal. When iron products were unsalable last summer, more than 3,000 workers were unemployed. When sales were brisk in winter, the price rose sharply. Now Shanxi Province has allocated 4 billion yuan to establish a state-owned warehouse in the area to fundamentally solve the sales problem of iron products.

In some remote areas, such as Anbei County and Jiu Caizhuang in Qinghe County, Suiyuan Province, efforts have been made to overcome difficulties in transportation and security, and markets have been established. After the establishment of the market, the exchange of native products and industrial and handicraft products has become much easier, and the masses are very satisfied.

Holding Department Store Fairs to Strengthen Mass Commodity Exchange

The more organized development of mass commodity exchange is also a remarkable feature of the North China native product promotion campaign during this period. Local temple fairs, department store fairs, and horse fairs have been well organized and prepared, the supply of goods is sufficient, the price control is reasonable, the transaction volume is large, farmers do not suffer losses, and merchants also make more money. For example, at the horse fair in Jining Chengguan, Suiyuan Province, the business volume of private merchants generally increased by more than double compared to usual, and the most increased by more than ten times; the conference was originally scheduled to last for six days, and farmers and merchants unanimously requested an extension of three days. The Genghis Khan sacrificial ceremony in the Ikezhao League was also held grandly this year. The venue was in Ijinholo, 370 miles southwest of Baotou. There are no buildings in the area. During the conference, tents were set up to form a street. A total of more than 20,000 Mongol and Han people participated (including more than 5,000 vendors), and the transaction volume increased by more than ten times compared to last year. The province-wide commodity exchange conference, Suiyuan, began on May 20, and other provinces are planning to hold it, and all welcome representatives from other provinces and regions to mobilize private merchants to participate.

Through the exchange of native products between vast regions, and the appropriate emphasis on remote areas, the native products produced in the North China region in 1950, worth 7 billion catties of millet, have been basically sold out. In order to further carry out the native product promotion campaign, the following work is being carried out in various places:

First, guide and organize the production of native products. Chahar has studied and determined that: among the economic crops, white hemp, sunflower, flax, rapeseed, and tobacco leaves are selling well and should be increased in production; among the medicinal materials, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Paeonia veitchii, Saposhnikovia divaricata, Atractylodes lancea, Bupleurum chinense, and Platycodon grandiflorus are temporarily unsalable and should be produced according to sales; Rheum officinale, believing that it will not be sold in the future, should be discontinued.

Second, develop handicrafts in a planned manner. The Anyang Special Zone in Pingyuan Province held a handicraft symposium, absorbing representatives from farmers and handicraft workers to participate, and signed more than 500 contracts and agreements. 5,421 agricultural tools and 1,248 small items are now sold and ordered. The needs of farmers are met, and the planning of handicraft production has also increased.

Third, strengthen organizational leadership. The financial and economic committees of all provinces have established native product promotion committees, or added native product promotion offices or sections to the commercial bureaus. Beijing and Tianjin have established urban and rural commodity exchange guidance committees to ensure that dedicated personnel are always responsible. All provinces plan to hold provincial native product conferences or native product purchase and sale planning conferences before June to study the 1951 native product promotion plan. Most special zones and counties in all provinces are also preparing to hold native product exhibitions in order to expand native product promotion and guide native product production.

　　与全国广大地区建立贸易关系展开群众性物资交流
    华北去年所产土产基本上销完
    自三月下旬华北第二次土产会议召开以来，华北地区的推销土产工作已有更广阔的开展。到目前为止，全区一九五○年所产的各类土产已基本上推销完了，不少种类的土产出现供不应求的情况。现各省正准备召开土产计划会议，研究和制定一九五一年土产的生产和推销计划，以便更加有系统地有计划地经常地推进这一工作。
  派遣土产访问团，广泛与其他地区建立贸易关系
    这一时期华北推销土产工作最显著的特点，是与其他地区广泛建立贸易关系，从而使广大区域间土产交流趋于活跃。自三月份开始，华北各省市先后组织了有公私代表参加的土产访问团，分赴华东、中南、西北、东北进行访问。为了全面地、有计划地推销华北土产，中共中央华北局财政经济工作委员会特组织华北区土产访问团，于五月二十二日出发访问南京、上海、汉口、广州等地。访问团所到各地，除了介绍本区土产情况，了解友区土产情况，及与友区签订合同协议，建立买卖、代购、代销等业务关系外，并参加了友区所举办的土产展览会。北京市工商访问团在杭州土产展览会上，展出特种手工艺品、成药和土产食品，均打开极好的销路。中共中央华北局财政经济工作委员会并专派参观团参加湖南省土产展览会，参观期间订立五件协议，把湖南特产的雨具、夏布、棕绳贩到华北来，把华北名产红枣、棉籽、药材销到湖南去。四月在天津召开了南北药材会议，各大行政区均有代表参加，共订合同协议一百一十五件，销出药材一百六十余万斤，价值七十亿元。
  派遣常驻小组是打开远地销路的有效方式
    派出常驻的推销小组是向远地打开销路的有效方式。山西省土产公司以十一个干部，组成五个小组，分驻上海、汉口、郑州、天津、绥远等地，两个月内推销出各类土产二百四十万斤，创造了山西推销土产的新纪录。北京市私营针织业联营推销小组，三月间去东北沈阳、哈尔滨、长春等地，所带货物全部卖光，并成立订货合同。在东北打开销路后，该联营组织即派定专人常驻沈阳等地。特种手工艺业联营去大连，很受欢迎，已与苏联秋林公司建立代销关系，把特种工艺品输往苏联去。
  克服了偏向，重视偏僻地区，推进了推销工作
    “重平原、轻山地”、“重大宗、轻小宗”、“重热货、轻冷货”的偏向在这一时期的推销运动中已经得到根本的克服。国营的土产公司、一揽子公司或货栈开始在偏僻地区建立起来。冀中有名的水产区白洋淀（在河北安新县），每年可产鱼虾一千八百万斤、菱角二十万斤、白莲藕六万斤、鸡蛋米十万斤、鸭蛋八十万枚，过去因为没有国家贸易机构领导经营，销路很不正常；又每年可产苇席四、五百万斤，销路很快，但因编苇原料（苇草）不足，不能充分生产，过去也缺乏足够力量加以解决，现河北省合作社已在该地组织专营鱼业和苇席的合作社，并建立水产加工工厂，如此既掌握了当地市场，又保证了渔民的长远利益，全区渔民十分拥护。山西省阳泉工矿区现有生熟铁炉五百多个，年产各种铁货一万多吨，历史上销路很广，但因经营铁货的资金薄弱（原有六家私营铁货栈只能收购六十个铁炉的产品），致使生产情况很不正常，去年夏季铁货滞销时曾有三千多工人失业，冬季畅销时价格又大涨。现山西省已拨四十亿资金，在该地设立国营货栈，从根本上解决铁货的销路问题。
    有些偏僻地区，如绥远省安北县和清河县的韭菜庄等地，已经大力克服交通治安等方面的困难，建立起集市来。集市建立之后，土产和工业、手工业品的交换大为便利，群众非常满意。
  举办百货大会，加强群众性物资交流
    群众性物资交流更加有组织的开展也是这一时期华北推销土产运动中令人注目的特点。各地庙会、百货大会、骡马大会都经过很好的组织和准备，物资供应充分，价格掌握合理，成交量大，农民不吃亏，商人也多赚了钱。如绥远省集宁城关的骡马大会，私商营业额一般比平时增加一倍多，最多的增加十余倍；大会原拟开六天，农民和商人一致要求延长三天。伊克昭盟的成吉斯汗祭祀大会，今年也隆重举行，会址在包头西南三百七十里的伊金霍洛，该地无任何建筑，大会期内搭帐幕而成街，共有蒙、汉人民两万多人参加（内商贩五千余人），交易额比去年增加十倍多。全省范围的物资交流大会，绥远已于五月二十日开始举行，其他各省正在计划举行，均欢迎外省外区派代表动员私商参加。
    经过广大地区间的、广泛群众性的土产交流，和对偏僻地区的适当重视，华北区一九五○年所产价值七十亿斤小米的土产已基本上推销完毕。为进一步开展土产推销运动，各地正进行以下工作：
    一、指导和组织土产品的生产。察哈尔已研究确定：经济作物中白麻、葵花、葫麻、菜籽、烟叶均畅销，应增产；药材中知母、赤芍、防风、仓术、柴胡，桔梗一时滞销，应以销定产；山大黄，狠毒估计将来也没销路，应停产。
    二、有计划地发展手工业。平原省安阳专区召开手工业座谈会，吸收农民和手工业者代表参加，订成合同协议五百余件，现销和订购农具五千四百二十一件，碎货一千二百四十八件，农民需要得以满足，手工业生产也增加了计划性。
    三、加强组织领导。各省财政经济委员会都已成立推销土产委员会，或于商业厅增设推销土产的处或科，北京、天津市成立了城乡物资交流指导委员会，做到有专人经常负责。各省均计划在六月份以前召开全省土产会议或土产购销计划会议，研究一九五一年的土产推销计划。各省大部专区和县并在准备举办土产展览会，以便扩大土产推销和指导土产生产。
