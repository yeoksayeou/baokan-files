A Model of Farmer Spare-Time Schools

How Zuoquan Zhangba Village People's School Was Run Successfully
Guan Shouyao

Zhangba Village, Zuoquan, started winter school as early as ten years ago. But because the masses' lives were still difficult at that time, the winter school was a case of "people come, but their hearts don't, and it collapses in the spring." After the land reform, with the lead of labor model Sun Chengyin, and through mutual aid production, everyone's life improved, and they urgently demanded to learn culture. In the winter of 1947, the winter school officially transformed into a year-round farmer spare-time school (hereinafter referred to as the People's School). Through the efforts of voluntary teacher Comrade Du Zhenwu, the People's School has become more developed and consolidated, becoming one of the model People's Schools in the province.

	Party Members and League Members Take the Lead in Studying

Last winter, labor model Sun Chengyin (Party Branch Secretary), who attended the Provincial Labor Model Representative Conference, said after returning to the village: "Everything was good this time, except that because I am illiterate, I cannot bring all the experience from the conference back to everyone. I am now determined to participate in the People's School cultural class study. Society is progressing day by day, and if we don't study, we will fall behind!" The next day, he went to the People's School. Under his influence, in addition to all the young people enrolling, another thirteen middle-aged men and women signed up for enrollment. Comrade Chengyin recognized 148 characters in one winter and was selected by the masses as a model. The idea among some middle-aged people that "they are too old to learn" was also cleared up.

	Good Ways to Consolidate Spare-Time Schools

After mobilizing the masses to enroll, consolidating the students' learning enthusiasm is an important key. Comrade Du Zhenwu used various methods to consolidate the People's School.

(1) Divide grades clearly and teach according to different objects: In the past, because the grading was inappropriate, those who couldn't handle it couldn't learn, and those who were not challenged were not interested, so everyone cooled down. Last winter, classes were divided into four grades. Sun Zhonghe didn't like to learn written arithmetic, so he was first taught to learn abacus, and then slowly guided him to learn written arithmetic, which he learned with great interest.

(2) Use achievements to inspire learning enthusiasm: The People's School stipulates that there will be a small test every ten days and a large test every month. The results are announced on the public blackboard. The students are all afraid of falling behind and strive to learn.

(3) Group roll call system: In the past, roll call often caused noise and wasted time. Last winter, it was stipulated that roll call would be done by group. During class, the group leaders reported the number of people who came, and the class could start immediately. Competition and commendation are also based on groups. This influences and promotes each other. Individual laggards in the group are afraid that their individual behavior will affect the entire group, so they actively participate.

(4) Public praise, individual criticism: Students are praised on the public blackboard for any achievements; shortcomings are individually educated through their organizational system.

(5) Leave of absence does not delay class: Women who live in their natal families must obtain a transfer certificate and report their academic performance upon return. Among the students, six drive livestock to sell coal. They organized a group and selected a "little teacher." When leaving, the "little teacher" arranges the classwork to be done on time and leads the study in his spare time.

	Everyone Runs the Public Blackboard

Letting the masses run the public blackboard together can not only make everyone truly concerned and promote various tasks, but also combine it with the students' learning. In the past, when a few people ran the blackboard, it was not only that materials were lacking, but also that the content was often untrue, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Later, the method of everyone running the blackboard was adopted, calling on the masses to write articles. Student Du Xianru submitted an article: "Li Xihuan is really capable, pulling a big hoe, competing with men, hoeing one and a half mu of millet in three days, topping ten points in the mutual aid group." After it was published, the masses reflected: "Xihuan is on the stage of honor! This is a real thing and should be praised." Later, more and more people submitted articles. Mutual aid group competitions also made being on the "stage of honor" a condition.

	Exert Oneself to Run One's Own School

The funding problem of the People's School has not been properly resolved over the years. Letting students pay automatically always resulted in some paying more and some not paying at all. Last spring, all the students organized themselves and collectively reclaimed three mu of wasteland and cultivated one mu of hemp land. The grain and hemp seeds harvested in the autumn, in addition to collectively buying textbooks and stationery and solving the expenses of the People's School, also had a surplus.

The issue of paying work points for voluntary teaching was resolved through discussion by the students themselves. Initially, it was decided that one day of teaching was worth three points, and three days were worth one work point, all of which would be paid by male students. Woman Li Qiaoyu proposed: "We women also want to pay work points. We can't do heavy work, but we can transplant seedlings and weed. Besides, Comrade Zhenwu doesn't have livestock. Those with donkeys can send him manure, and grinding flour can also count as work points." This solution satisfied both male and female students and voluntary teachers.

　　农民业余学校的典型
    左权丈八村民校是怎样办好的
    关守耀
    左权丈八村早在十年前就办开冬学了。但因为那时群众生活还很困难，冬学是“人来心不来，春天就垮台”。土地改革后，在劳动模范孙成寅的带动下，经过互助生产，家家的光景都过好啦，便迫切要求学习文化。一九四七年冬学便正式转为常年农民业余学校（以下简称民校）。经义务教员杜振武同志的努力，民校更加发展和巩固起来了，成为全省的模范民校之一。
            党团员带头上学
    去年冬天，劳动模范孙成寅（党支部书记），出席了全省劳动模范代表大会回村后说：“这回啥都好，就是因为自己不识字，不能把大会上所有的经验，给大家带回来。我现在要下决心参加民校文化班学习。社会一天比一天进步，再要不学习，就落到人家的后头啦！”第二天他就上了民校。在他的影响下，全村除青年全部入学外，又有壮年男女十三人报名入学。成寅同志一冬天就识一百四十八个字，被群众选为模范，壮年中一些认为“自己年纪大学不进去”的思想，也闹通啦。
            巩固业余学校的办法好
    发动起群众入学后，巩固学员的学习情绪，是一个重要的关键。杜振武同志，用了各种办法，巩固了民校。
    （一）划清年级，根据不同的对象教课：过去因分级不适当，啃不动的学不进去；不够学的没兴趣，结果都冷下来了。去年冬天，分了四个年级上课。孙中和不爱学笔算，就先教他学珠算，慢慢再引导他学笔算，他学得很感兴趣。
    （二）用成绩启发学习情绪：民校规定，十天一次小测验，一月一次大测验，把成绩公布在大众黑板上，学员都怕落后，都争先恐后学习。
    （三）分组点名制度：过去点名，常常是吵吵嚷嚷耽误时间。去年冬天规定了按小组点名，上课时，由各组长报告了来的人数，马上就能讲课。竞赛、表扬也是以小组为单位，这样互相影响推动，小组内有个别落后的，怕因自己一人影响了全组，也就积极起来了。
    （四）当众表扬，个别批评：学员有一点成绩，就在大众黑板报上表扬；有缺点就通过他的组织系统个别教育。
    （五）请假不误课：妇女住娘家，要领转学证，回来交待学习成绩，学员中有六个赶牲口卖煤的，组织了一个小组，选出“小先生”，走时按期布置下课，出去“小先生”抽时间领导学习。
            大众黑板报大家办
    大众黑板报让群众共同来办，不单能使大家真正关心起来，推动各种工作，同时也结合了学员的学习。过去少数人办黑板报，不光是材料缺乏，而且往往因为不真实，引起群众不满。后来，采用了大家办黑板报的方法，号召群众人人写稿。学员杜现如投的稿是：“李喜爱，真能行，拉大锄，赛男人，三天锄谷一亩半，互助组里顶十分。”登出后群众反映说：“喜爱上了光荣台啦！这可是实在事情，应该表扬。”以后投稿的人，越来越多了。互助组竞赛，还把上“光荣台”当做一个条件。
            自己出力办自己的学校
    民校的经费问题，历年来都没得到适当解决。让学员自动缴，每次都是多出的多出，不出的不出。去年春天，全体学员组织起来，集体开了三亩荒，修了一亩麻地。秋天收下的谷和麻籽麻皮，除集体买下课本文具，解决了民校的开支外，还有剩余。
    义务教学还工问题，是经过学员自己讨论解决的，开始决定教一天顶三分，三天顶一工，统由男学员内还工。妇女李巧鱼提出：“我们妇女也要还工。我们不能做重活，挽苗锄草都能行。再说振武同志没牲口，有驴的给他送粪，磨面也能顶工。”这样解决，男女学员、义务教员都满意。
