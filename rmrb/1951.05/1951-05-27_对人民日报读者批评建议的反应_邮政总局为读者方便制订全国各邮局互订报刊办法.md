In Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily
The General Post Office Formulates Measures for National Post Offices to Subscribe to Newspapers and Periodicals for Each Other

Comrade Editor:

The People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on March 28th published Comrade Zhao Cisheng's opinion on the establishment of a mutual newspaper and magazine subscription system by post offices. We believe it is very valuable. Based on Comrade Zhao's suggestion, we have drafted measures for national post offices to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals for each other, and have notified all bureaus to implement them in the 46th issue of the "Postal Gazette" published on April 21st.

The main reason why the Qingdao Post Office did not subscribe to newspapers and periodicals for each other was that the General Post Office did not formulate the mutual subscription procedures early enough; the service mentality of the staff in charge was also insufficient. The relevant departments have conducted a review to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应  邮政总局为读者方便制订全国各邮局互订报刊办法

　　对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    邮政总局为读者方便制订全国各邮局互订报刊办法编辑同志：
    三月二十八日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登赵慈生同志对邮局建立互订报刊制度的意见，我们认为很宝贵，已根据赵同志建议拟订了全国各邮局互订报刊办法，并已在四月二十一日出版之四十六号《邮政公报》上通知各局执行。
    青岛邮局未互订报刊，主要原因是由于总局未及早拟定互订报刊手续；经办人为读者服务思想也不够，已由相关方面进行检讨，防止今后再有类似事件发生。
