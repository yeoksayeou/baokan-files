Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 6th: The Korean Democratic Youth League's newspaper "Democratic Youth" published an editorial on May 4th to celebrate China's Youth Day and pay tribute to Chinese youth. The editorial stated: "May Fourth" is the festival of our closest comrades-in-arms, the Chinese youth. For more than thirty years, the heroic Chinese youth, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, have achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution as a result of their heroic revolutionary struggle. This is the most powerful blow to the imperialist system since the October Revolution. On this festive occasion, all the youth of our republic extend warm congratulations and respect to the Chinese youth.

The editorial pointed out: Today, the heroic Chinese people and Chinese youth are launching the movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. A large number of outstanding Chinese sons and daughters are vying to join the Chinese People's Volunteers under the banner of lofty internationalism and patriotism to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield. They have already dealt a decisive blow to the new war instigators headed by US imperialism.

The editorial continued: The entire youth of our republic will never forget the assistance given to us by the great Chinese people and youth during our extremely difficult times. We firmly believe that the heroic Chinese youth, under the banner of Chairman Mao, will achieve even more brilliant results in the cause of defending world peace and Asian security, and strengthening the power of New China.

The editorial concluded: We must strive to further consolidate the friendship and unity between the youth of Korea and China, and join hands with the heroic Chinese youth to bravely advance to eliminate the US imperialist aggressors! Glory to the fraternal Chinese people and youth!
