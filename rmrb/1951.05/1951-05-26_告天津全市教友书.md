An Open Letter to All Catholics in Tianjin

Fellow Catholics:

Wen Guibin has consistently oppressed Chinese priests and Catholics. In 1922, he wrote to the Vatican, slandering the Chinese as "pigs" who were not qualified to be bishops. Chinese priests in the Tianjin diocese were deprived of adequate food, clothing, and medical care. Father Su Baohe was only allowed into a hospital when he was dying, while Dutch priests in Tianjin lived in luxury. He deliberately destroyed the Tianjin diocese, unwilling to let it fall into the hands of Chinese priests. He gathered a group of Dutchmen, intending to turn the Tianjin diocese into a Dutch diocese. After opposition from Chinese priests, he then tried to divide the Tianjin diocese into two halves, one for Chinese priests and one for Dutch priests. Therefore, he always gave the best parishes to Dutch priests. Seeing that his conspiracy was unsuccessful, he transferred cash to the Dutchmen Yang San, Mei Rongjiu, and Zheng Huamin, who smuggled it in batches to Indonesia, the Philippines, and other places, where they engaged in aggression and formed an encirclement against China, plotting espionage and sabotage activities. In a meeting with all Chinese priests two weeks ago to report on the accounts, Wen said, "There are only 20 million yuan in cash, and Bu Xiangxian borrowed 200 million yuan." He also said, "The accounts have been burned, there are no accounts." Chinese priests questioned him for two hours, and Wen was speechless. It is clear that he colluded with the Dutch to steal the property of the Tianjin diocese. Canon 2346 of the Sacred Canon stipulates that "Anyone who dares to use or occupy any property of the Catholic Church for his own benefit, or prevents its孳息 from reaching the hands of the rightful beneficiaries, shall be excommunicated until he has fully returned the property or removed the obstruction and obtained absolution from the Holy See. If a cleric commits or consents to others committing such an act, he shall also be deprived of all his sacred benefices and his ability to hold any other office, and after full compensation and absolution, and with the opinion of his legitimate superiors, he shall be suspended from the exercise of his priestly functions."

At our two collective inquiry meetings with over 300 Catholics, Wen has fully admitted to violating the Sacred Canon. Catholics, think about it, he abuses his divine power and embezzles church funds so boldly towards God, let alone towards us Catholics. According to the Sacred Canon, he no longer has any divine power. If we continue to believe in his divine power, it will not only be useless but sinful.

Wen Guibin has consistently opposed the People's Government. He has said: "Whoever welcomes the People's Liberation Army welcomes the devil and will go to hell"; "It is forbidden to work in government agencies, and there must be no cooperation with the government until death"; "It is forbidden to read newspapers, and it is forbidden to enter Huada, Geda, and Nanda. The above three universities are devil universities." He instigated Bu Xiangxian and others to organize espionage activities and assisted the American imperialist secret agent Lei Zhenyuan in organizing the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps." He instigated Bai En to organize the reactionary "Holy Mother's Attendant Corps," distributed reactionary pamphlets, and spread reactionary rumors such as the Third World War and the American imperialists' atomic bombs.

Wen Guibin also privately hid Japanese secret agent priests Taguchi and Iwashita in the Xikai Church. After the Japanese surrendered, he provided shelter and concealed real estate for the arch-traitor and secret agent Xu Shuqiang. All those who are guilty of heinous crimes are his close relatives, while he regards good Catholics as enemies. Wen admitted to all the above crimes when questioned by Catholics.

Catholics! Look, is Wen Guibin preaching the Gospel of God or imperialism? We must love the Church and ensure that our Church continues to be passed on! We must achieve the following: 1. Because he has violated the Sacred Canon, Catholics cannot recognize his divine power. 2. Resolutely recover the church funds embezzled by Wen Guibin.

Catholics: We have established a Church Property Management Committee to investigate the church property embezzled by Wen Guibin. All Catholics! Let us unite! Accuse Wen Guibin of his crimes during his 50 years in our country! Resolutely eliminate the imperialist elements within the Church! Thoroughly sever all ties between the Catholic Church and the imperialist elements!

Initiated by more than 300 Catholics in Tianjin who participated in the inquiry meeting.

专栏：

　　告天津全市教友书教友们：
    文贵宾一贯欺压中国神父教友，一九二二年他曾上书梵蒂冈教廷，诬蔑中国人是“猪”，没有升主教的资格。天津教区的中国神父吃不上穿不上有病不给治，苏宝和神父临死才准进医院，而在天津的荷兰神父生活豪华。他蓄意毁灭了天津教区，也不能落在中国神父手里。他召集了一帮荷兰人来，想把天津教区变为荷兰教区，经中国神父反对，他又想把天津教区分为两半，一是中国神父，一是荷兰神父，因此，总把好的堂口交荷兰神父占据，又看阴谋未遂，即将现款交由荷兰人杨三、梅荣久、郑化民，分批盗往印度尼西亚、菲律宾等地，又去那里侵略，并构成对中国的包围圈，策动间谍破坏活动。在前两星期，文向全体中国神父交账的会上说：“只有现款两千来万元，卜相贤借去两亿元”，又说“账已烧了，没有账”。中国神父向他提出了两小时的质问，文无言答对，显系与荷兰人合谋，将天津教区财产盗走，圣教法典第二三四六条之规定“凡擅敢自己或用他人意图，为自身利益而使用或侵占公教会任何财产者，或阻碍其孳息不能到达有收益权人手者，于未完全交还财物或未取消该阻碍，并未求得宗座之解赦以前，当然受弃绝。如教士自己犯之或同意他人犯之，应并罢免其一切圣禄职及褫夺其任何其他职务之能力，至于完全赔偿及受到解赦后，以及其正权利之意见，受停止其行使神品权之罚。”
    在我们三百余教友两次集体追询大会上，文已完全承认违犯了圣教法典，教友们：请想他这样滥用神权，侵吞教款，对天主都这样大胆妄为，何况对我们教友呢，从圣教法典上看，他已经没有任何神权了，我们再信他的神权，不仅无功，反而有罪。
    文贵宾一贯反人民政府。他说过：“谁欢迎解放军就是欢迎魔鬼，下地狱”；“不准在政府机关作事，至死不能与政府合作”；“不准看报纸，不准入华大、革大、南大，以上三个大学是魔鬼大学”。主使卜相贤等组织间谍活动，协助美帝国主义特务雷震远组织“公教青年报国团”。主使柏恩组织反动的“圣母御侍团”，散发反动小册子，以及散布三次世界大战、美帝国主义原子弹等反动谣言。
    文贵宾还曾在西开教堂内私藏日本特务神父田口、岩下，日寇投降后给大汉奸特务徐树强隐匿房产。凡是罪大恶极的人，都是他的至亲，善良的教友他认成仇人，以上罪恶事实，教友质问时，文都一一承认。
    教友们！请看文贵宾传的是天主的福音，还是帝国主义呢？我们要爱教，要我们的教继续传下去！必须实现以下：１、因他已违犯圣教法典，教友们无法承认他的神权。２、坚决追回文贵宾侵占的教款。
    教友们：我们已经成立教产保管委员会，清查文贵宾侵占的教产，全体教友们！我们一致起来吧！控诉文贵宾来我国五十年来的罪恶吧！坚决肃清教内的帝国主义分子！彻底割断天主教与帝国主义分子的各方面的联系！
        天津市天主教三百余参加追询大会的教友同启
                          五月十八日
