　　The Chinese History Was Created by Revolutionary People; Wu Xun Only Played a Role in Obstructing the Revolution
Editor:
    Some people have described Wu Xun, a lackey of the feudal ruling class and a wolf in sheep's clothing, as a person with the excellent and noble qualities of the Chinese working people, and even unscrupulously waved the revolutionary banner of "serving the people" to promote him. This is a great insult to the Chinese people and Chinese history.
    Chairman Mao, in his book "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," when discussing the characteristics of the Chinese nation, said: "The Chinese nation is not only known to the world for its hard work and endurance, but also a nation that loves freedom and is rich in revolutionary traditions. Taking the history of the Han people as an example, it proves that the Chinese people cannot tolerate the rule of dark forces, and they use revolutionary means to overthrow and transform this rule every time. In the thousands of years of the Han people's history, there have been hundreds of peasant uprisings to resist the dark rule of landlords and nobles; and each change of dynasty was successful only because of the power of peasant uprisings." Doesn't Chairman Mao's statement correctly point out that the Chinese people rely on their own labor to create their own lives, create their own history, and use revolutionary means to promote social progress and development?
    But what about Wu Xun, the docile slave of the landlord class? He initially knelt down to the landlords, begging for rewards to survive; then he gave the money to the landlords to lend at usurious rates, exploiting the working people; later, he used the money he had exploited from the working people to "establish free schools," training docile slaves for the feudal ruling class and acting as accomplices in the ruling class's oppression of the working people. At the same time, in Wu Xun's view, the Taiping Rebellion was not a peasant revolutionary movement against exploitation and oppression, but "a great act of rebellion" and "a great change in human relations." His "establishing free schools" only weakened the fighting will of the working people. Therefore, Wu Xun was a rebellious son of the working people and did not possess a trace of the ambition that the Chinese working people should have.

### 中国历史是革命人民创造的  武训只起了阻碍革命的作用

　　中国历史是革命人民创造的  武训只起了阻碍革命的作用编辑同志：
    有些人曾经把封建统治阶级的奴才，披着羊皮的走狗武训说成具有中国劳动人民优良崇高品质的人，甚至不惜打起“为人民服务”的革命旗帜来宣扬他，这是对中国人民和中国历史莫大的污辱。
    毛主席在“中国革命与中国共产党”一书中论到中华民族的特点时说：“中华民族不但是以刻苦耐劳著称于世，同时又是酷爱自由富于革命传统的民族。以汉族的历史为例，证明中国人民是不能忍受黑暗势力的统治的，他们每次都用革命的手段达到推翻与改造这种统治的目的。在汉族的数千年的历史上，有过几百次的农民暴动，反抗地主贵族的黑暗统治；而每次朝代的更换，都是由于农民暴动的力量才能得到成功的。”毛主席这段话不是正确指出中国人民靠自己的劳动创造自己的生活，创造自己的历史，用革命手段来推动社会前进和发展吗？
    但是地主阶级的驯服奴才武训呢？他最初向地主跪倒，以叩头求赏来活命；继而把钱交给地主放高利贷，剥削劳动人民；后来又把剥削劳动人民的钱拿来“兴办义学”，替封建统治阶级培养驯服的奴才，作统治阶级压迫劳动人民的帮凶。同时，在武训看来，太平天国运动不是什么反剥削、反压迫的农民革命运动，而是“大逆不道”、“人伦大变”。他“兴办义学”只是削弱劳动人民的斗争意志。所以，武训是劳动人民的逆子，没有一丝一毫中国劳动人民应有的志气。
