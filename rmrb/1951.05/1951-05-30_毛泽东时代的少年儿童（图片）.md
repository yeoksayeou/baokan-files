    Children of the Mao Zedong Era
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu De loves children; they surround him and become close to him as soon as they see him.
    The children of New China, nurtured by the sunshine of the great leader Mao Zedong, are happy and joyful. They love the motherland and the leader; they want to study hard and be ready to serve the motherland at all times. This is Chairman Mao on the Tiananmen Rostrum on the day of the capital's celebration of "May Day" International Labor Day, with the Young Pioneers who presented him with flowers.
    Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world, is as bright and warm as the sun in the hearts of Chinese children, because he is inseparable from the happiness of children all over the world. These two children are smiling as they look at Stalin's portrait.
    The Young Pioneers of the August 1st Elementary School of the North China Military Region laughed happily when they read the news that the Chinese People's Volunteers had captured American prisoners alive on the Korean front.
    The Young Pioneers respect the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and they look at the soldiers' commemorative medals with affection. They said: "Our red scarves are a corner of the great five-star red flag of the motherland; they are the symbol that you exchanged with blood."
    The vast number of rural children in China are no longer suffering from hunger and cold after the land reform, and they are living a happy and joyful life; look! These are the grandchildren of farmer Guan Dequan in Minhe Village, Shuangcheng County, Jilin, and they are all wearing new clothes. Playing with kittens on the kang.
    The children of workers in New China have gained the opportunity to receive education. This is a class at the Jiangnan Railway Workers' Children's School in Hankou. More than 2,000 railway workers' children are studying at this school.
    The children of New China not only love their motherland, but also love the Korean People's Army who are fighting side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers. These children are singing with representatives of the Korean People's Army.
    The children of the Mao Zedong era also appreciate the works of art left by our ancestors. These Young Pioneers are visiting the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai Park, a famous scenic spot in Beijing.
    The children of New China love science. This is the radio group, and they are concentrating on studying the principles of radio. The children of New China love labor. This is the gardening group, and they are planting vegetables.
    Practice your body well and prepare to serve the motherland. Young Pioneers in Beijing use their holidays to row boats in Beihai Park.
    New China attaches great importance to child care. There are now 74 nurseries in Beijing, 53 of which are public. Children are well taken care of in the nurseries, and they all grow up to be healthy and lovely.

    毛泽东时代的少年儿童
    朱总司令热爱孩子，孩子们一看见他就围上去和他亲近。
    在伟大的领袖毛泽东阳光抚育下的新中国少年儿童，是幸福和愉快的。他们热爱祖国，热爱领袖；他们要好好地学习，时时准备着为祖国服务。这是首都庆祝“五一”国际劳动节那天，毛主席与向他献花的少年儿童队员在天安门检阅台上。
    世界劳动人民的领袖斯大林，在中国儿童的心里，像太阳一样的光亮和温暖，因为他与全世界儿童的幸福是分不开的。这两个儿童正在微笑地看着斯大林的画像。
    华北军区八一小学的少年儿童队员，读到中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线活捉美国俘虏的消息，都高兴地笑了。
    少年儿童队员敬爱人民解放军的战士，他们亲切地看着战士的纪念章。他们说：“我们的红领巾，是祖国伟大五星红旗的一角；是你们用鲜血换来的标志。”
    中国广大的农村儿童在土地改革后，他们已不再受着饥饿和寒冷，正过着幸福和快乐的生活；看！这是吉林双城县民合村农民关德全的孙儿，他们都穿上了新衣。在炕上玩着猫咪。
    新中国的工人子弟，已经获得了受教育的机会。这是汉口江南铁路职工子弟学校的学生正在上课。这所学校有二千多铁路职工子弟在读书。
    新中国的少年儿童不仅热爱祖国，也热爱与中国人民志愿军并肩作战的朝鲜人民军。这些少年儿童正在和朝鲜人民军代表一齐唱歌。
    毛泽东时代的少年儿童，他们也欣赏我们祖先遗留下来的艺术品。这些少年儿童队员正在参观北京名胜北海九龙壁。
    新中国的少年儿童热爱科学。这是收音机小组，他们正在专心一致地研究着无线电的原理。新中国的少年儿童热爱劳动。这是园艺小组，他们正在种植蔬菜。
    练好身体，准备为祖国服务。北京少年儿童队员利用假日，在北海划船。
    新中国的儿童保育工作是极被重视的。现在北京有七十四个托儿所；其中公立的就有五十三个。儿童在托儿所内受到很好的照顾，一个个都长得健壮可爱。
