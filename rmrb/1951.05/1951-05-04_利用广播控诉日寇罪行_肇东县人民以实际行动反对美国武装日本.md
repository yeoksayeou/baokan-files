    Using Radio Broadcasts to Accuse the Japanese of Crimes
    -- Zhaodong County People Take Practical Actions to Oppose American Armament of Japan

    To the Editors:
    In order to popularize and deepen the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, the Zhaodong County Cultural Center in Heilongjiang Province held a radio broadcast meeting on April 10 to oppose the American armament of Japan and to accuse Japanese imperialist crimes. This broadcast meeting raised the people's political consciousness, aroused the masses' hatred of American and Japanese imperialism, and promoted workers and farmers to take practical actions to aid Korea by doing a good job in production.

    According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 people in the county seat listened to the broadcast. Because the accusers were all local people, and the things they accused were all familiar to everyone, everyone was very moved when they heard it, recalling the persecution they had suffered from the Japanese invaders in the past, and were extremely angry about the American armament of Japan. After listening to the broadcast, many people automatically held small accusation meetings. Many people voluntarily requested to go to the radio station to accuse the Japanese devils of the bloody crimes of persecuting them and their relatives. Lu Zhiyuan of Gongyixing Leather Shop, Zhou Gongmao, Liu Yonggui, and Song Yaodong, residents of Sanhe Street, all went to the radio station to accuse the Japanese devils of the bloody crimes of persecuting them and their relatives. Many people who didn't care about current affairs in the past were greatly educated after listening to the broadcast. For example, Gao, an old lady from Group 7 of Sannan Street, said: "In the past, when I heard that the crimes of the Japanese devils were to be accused, I thought: Why accuse the past? After listening to today's broadcast, I realized that the American devils want to rearm Japan and still want to bully us. We can't let the American devils' tricks succeed!" All the accusers and listeners expressed their firm opposition to the American armament of Japan and their support for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers.

    The broadcast meeting played a great role in promoting practical work. The quality of paper produced by the paper mill in the past was poor, with black color and holes. After listening to the broadcast, the workers of the well group proposed to ensure that the materials were washed well; the workers of the paper-making group put forward the slogan "One more piece of paper copied is one more point of strength to strike at the American devils", and the production efficiency of the whole group increased by 20% compared with the past. The workers of the Wula group in the leather factory used to be disunited. After listening to the accusations, everyone made self-criticisms, promising to strengthen unity and increase production to oppose the American armament of Japan; now the output per person has increased by one pair. After listening to the broadcast, the farmers also determined to strive for a bumper harvest. Lü Ziyuan and Liu Youfeng of Qidao Street have set out their weeding plans. After the accusation, Lu Zhiyuan of Gongyixing Leather Shop proposed to actively pay taxes and help the government stabilize prices, which was warmly responded to by the business community in the county.

    利用广播控诉日寇罪行
    ——肇东县人民以实际行动反对美国武装日本编辑同志：
    黑龙江省肇东县文化馆为了普及深入抗美援朝爱国主义宣传，在四月十日举行了反对美国武装日本、控诉日本帝国主义罪行广播会。这次广播会提高了人民的政治觉悟，激起了群众对美、日帝国主义的仇恨，并且推动了工人、农民以搞好生产的实际行动来抗美援朝。
    据不完全统计，县城内收听广播者有三千多人。因为控诉的都是本城内的人，控诉的事都是大家熟悉的，大家听了都非常感动，回忆起自己过去所受日寇的迫害、对美国武装日本极为愤怒。收听广播后，不少群众自动举行了小型控诉会。不少群众自动要求到广播站来控诉，公义兴皮铺吕治元、三合街居民周公茂、刘永贵、宋耀东等都到广播站控诉了日本鬼子迫害他们及他们亲人的血海深仇。许多过去不关心时事的人听了广播后都受了很大的教育，如三南街七组高老太太说：“我过去听说要控诉日本鬼子的罪行，就想：过去的事还控诉干吗？听了今天的广播，我才明白美国鬼子要重新武装日本，还想来欺侮咱。咱说啥也不能让美国鬼子的鬼计成功！”所有控诉者和听广播者都表示坚决反对美国武装日本，拥护五大国缔结和平公约。
    广播会对实际工作起了很大的推动作用。造纸厂过去产纸质量不好，色黑而有窟窿。听了广播以后，井工组工友提出保证洗好材料；抄纸组工友提出了“多抄一张纸，就增加打击美国鬼子的一分力量”的口号，全组生产效率比以前提高了百分之二十。皮革厂乌拉组工友过去闹不团结。听了控诉后，大家都作了检讨，保证加强团结、提高生产来反对美国武装日本；现在每人产量已增加了一双。农民们听了广播，也都决心要争取丰产，七道街吕子元和刘有锋等都订出了铲趟计划。公义兴皮铺吕治元在控诉后提出了踊跃纳税、帮助政府稳定物价，得到全县工商界的热烈响应。
