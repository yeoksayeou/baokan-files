　　At the Signing Ceremony of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
　　Speech by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Chief Representative of the Tibetan Local Government

　　Chairman, fellow delegates, distinguished guests:
　　For more than a century, we have been in a state of poverty and backwardness due to the deception and instigation of our greatest enemy, imperialism, and the alienation and division of our nation by the Manchu Qing government and the Kuomintang reactionary government. Especially in recent years, imperialism and the Kuomintang have spread much reactionary propaganda smearing and slandering the Communist Party and spreading horrifying rumors, which has made us harbor suspicions and fears about the Central People's Government. This time, we, as representatives of the Tibetan Local Government, responded to Chairman Mao's call for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and came to Beijing to participate in the glorious and historic negotiations on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. In Changdu, Ganzi, Kangding, Chongqing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, we were warmly welcomed and cared for by the leaders of various places along the way, and we personally witnessed the ethnic unity policy and the facts and initial achievements of regional autonomy of the Central People's Government. These facts clearly told us that today's Central People’s Government is fundamentallydifferent from the reactionary governments in the past. Therefore, we wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the ethnic unity policy of the Central People's Government and the correct policy of peaceful liberation of Tibet.

　　During our stay in Beijing for more than a month, we, the representatives of the Tibetan Local Government, sincerely thanked the leaders of the Central People's Government for their concern and guidance, especially the sincere and patient explanations of the central representatives headed by Director Li Weihan, which enabled us to further realize that the imperialist aggressors are the greatest enemy of our motherland and even more so of our Tibetan people. It also made us realize that the internal divisions within the Tibetan ethnicity created by imperialism and past reactionary governments must be eliminated. Thanks to the great appeal of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, the long-term discord within the Tibetan ethnicity since the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the 9th Panchen Lama has also been resolved fairly. Today, we deeply realize that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, and in unity and cooperation with all fraternal ethnicities in the country, can we drive out our common enemy, the imperialist aggressive forces, and consolidate the southwest national defense of our motherland, and only then can we build our prosperous and happy great family of the motherland. Now, we are very honored to have signed the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. From now on, the Tibetan people will be forever free from the shackles of imperialism and return to our own equal, friendly, mutually helpful, and united great family of the motherland!

　　After we return this time, we must resolutely implement this agreement personally signed by our plenipotentiary representatives, and at the same time, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, we will build our country's Tibet!

　　Finally, we want to shout: Long live our motherland, long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all our ethnicities!

　　在举行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的签字仪式时
    西藏地方政府首席代表阿沛·阿旺晋美讲话主席，各位代表，各位来宾：
    在一百多年来，由于我们最大的敌人帝国主义对我们的欺骗、挑拨，满清政府与国民党反动政府对我们民族的离间、分裂，使我们长期处在贫困和落后的境地。尤其是近几年来，帝国主义与国民党散布了许多对共产党污蔑造谣和骇人听闻的反动宣传，使我们对中央人民政府也存在着疑惧的心理。这一次，我们代表西藏地方政府，响应毛主席和平解放西藏的号召，来到北京参加光荣的有历史性的关于和平解放西藏办法的谈判。在昌都、甘孜、康定、重庆、西安，及广州、武汉，一路上受到各地首长的热烈欢迎与关怀，我们更亲眼目睹中央人民政府的民族团结政策和区域自治的事实与初步成绩。这些事实明确地告诉了我们：今天的中央人民政府和过去历代的反动政府是根本不同的。所以，我们衷心地热烈地拥护中央人民政府的民族团结政策与和平解放西藏的正确方针。
    在北京一个多月的时间里，我们西藏地方政府代表更衷心地感谢中央人民政府各首长对我们的关切指导，特别是以李维汉主任委员为首的中央代表们对我们诚恳耐心的解释，使我们进一步地认识帝国主义侵略者是我们祖国的更是我们藏族人民的最大敌人。也使我们认识到：藏族内部必须消除过去帝国主义和历代反动政府制造的分裂。由于毛主席民族政策的伟大感召，藏族内部自前十三世达赖和九世班禅之间以来的长期的不和睦，也得到公平的解决了。今天我们深深地认识到：只有在中央人民政府毛主席领导之下，与全国各兄弟民族团结合作，才能驱逐我们共同的敌人帝国主义侵略势力与巩固我们祖国的西南国防，也才能建设好我们繁荣幸福的祖国大家庭。现在，我们很光荣地签定了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。从此，藏族人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，而回到我们自己平等、友爱、互助、团结的祖国大家庭里来！
    我们此次回去，一定要坚决执行我们全权代表所亲手签定的这个协议，同时我们要在中央人民政府领导下，建设我们祖国的西藏！
    最后我们要高呼：我们的祖国，我们各民族的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
