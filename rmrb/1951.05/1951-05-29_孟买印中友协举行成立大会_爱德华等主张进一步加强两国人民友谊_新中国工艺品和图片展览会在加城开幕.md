Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 28th. The Bombay India-China Friendship Association held its inaugural meeting on the 15th. More than 1,000 Bombay residents and students from the Bombay Overseas Chinese School attended the meeting.

Gharancha, editor of the "Lightning" weekly, and chairman of the meeting, praised the friendship between the people of India and China in his speech. He said: "Three hundred and fifty million Indian people and five hundred million Chinese people are extending their hands to each other, across the towering Himalayas, to carry out a powerful historical handshake. Long live India-China friendship!"

Kang Maozhao, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in India, was invited to attend the meeting and spoke at the meeting.

After reporting on the new atmosphere he saw in People's China, Edwards said: "I want to warn the American warmongers that if they think they can easily fight against China, they are wrong. If China is attacked, all of us Asians, especially the Indian people, will stand up and fight alongside our Chinese friends. Warmongers! Don't think these are empty words. These words come from the bottom of every Indian's heart."

While speaking, Chaffis expressed his pleasure at the establishment of the association.

    【新华社新德里二十八日电】孟买印中友好协会十五日举行成立大会。到会的有孟买居民一千多人和孟买的华侨学校的学生。
    大会主席“闪电”周刊编辑加伦查在讲话中赞扬印中两国人民的友谊。他说：“三亿五千万印度人民和五亿中国人民，正彼此伸出手来，越过高耸的喜马拉雅山，实行有力的历史性的握手。印、中友谊万岁！”
    我国驻印大使馆参赞康矛召应邀参加大会，并在会上讲话。他着重指出：中、印两国八亿以上人民的友谊和团结，将成为保卫亚洲与世界和平的强大力量。他的讲话不断为听众的掌声所打断。听众高呼着“中国人民和印度人民是兄弟”、“印、中友好万岁”。

    查菲斯在发言的时候，对于协会的成立，表示欣慰。他说：这个协会的成立，将在两国艺术、文化的友好交流上，打开一条新的道路。他希望两国不久就互派作家、艺术家、电影工作者以及其他各界的人民组成的代表团，进一步地加强两国人民的友谊。
