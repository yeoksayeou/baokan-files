The People's Representative Conference of Pingyuan Province Exercises the Functions and Powers of the People's Congress: New Experiences in the Preparation and Leadership of the Conference
[This newspaper reports] The first session of the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Pingyuan Province, exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress, was held from January 5th to 17th this year, marking the broad formation of the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front and the further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship throughout the province.

The main characteristic of this conference worth introducing is that its preparatory work was carried out entirely in accordance with the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Provinces" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Government's instructions on successfully convening people's representative conferences of all circles, and under the leadership of the Provincial People's Government and the enthusiastic support and assistance of various democratic parties, organs, organizations, and the broad masses of people in various regions. The Provincial People's Government Committee issued a decision on convening the Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Circles on September 7th last year, stipulating the functions and tasks of the representative conference. The method of generating representatives was as follows: regional representatives were elected by the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles and their Standing Committees in counties and cities; representatives of ethnic minorities implemented regional elections; representatives of parties, organizations, organs, and troops were elected separately by each unit; invited representatives were recommended by all parties, agreed upon by the conference preparatory committee, and hired by the Provincial People's Government. While generating representatives, the conference preparatory committee immediately notified various places to collect proposals. During the preparation period, the conference preparatory committee drafted seven important documents such as the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government," the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Circles," and the "Measures for the Election of the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and Members of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government"; the preparatory committee also formulated "Propaganda Outlines on Convening the Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Circles" to carry out propaganda among the masses, which was enthusiastically supported by people of all ethnic groups and all circles throughout the province.

Another important characteristic of the conference was that all representatives enthusiastically discussed Comrade Wu De, Secretary of the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's speech on the current domestic and international situation, the government work report by Chairman Chao Zhefu of the Provincial People's Government, and the financial work report by Vice-Chairman Luo Yuchuan. The 425 representatives attending the meeting brought more than 1,200 proposals, and put forward many suggestions and criticisms regarding resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, production and construction, and democratic work style. The conference's proposal review committee very seriously and repeatedly studied and carefully handled various proposals. There was a clear guiding ideology in the conference, that is, emphasizing that the representatives' proposals are the opinions of all circles of people on the inspection and improvement of government work; seriously handling proposals is one of the keys to closely connecting the government with the people, and is an important symbol of the government relying on the people and implementing a democratic work style. Therefore, the result of the conference's handling of proposals made all representatives unanimously satisfied.

　　平原省人民代表会议代行代表大会职权
    会议的筹备与领导有新的经验
    【本报讯】平原省于今年一月五日至十七日举行了代行人民代表大会职权的第一届各界人民代表会议，标志着全省反帝爱国统一战线的广泛形成和人民民主专政的更加巩固。
    此次会议值得介绍的主要特点是它的筹备工作，完全依据中央人民政府政务院颁布的“省各界人民代表会议组织通则”及中央对开好各界人民代表会议的各项指示，和在省人民政府领导与各民主党派、机关、团体及各地区广大人民的热烈拥护、帮助下进行的。省人民政府委员会于去年九月七日发出关于召开省各界人民代表会议的决定，规定了代表会议的职权和任务。代表的产生办法是：地区代表由县、市各界人民代表会议及其常务委员会推选；少数民族代表实行区域选举；党派、团体、机关、部队代表由各单位分别选举；邀请代表由各方推荐、大会筹备委员会协议和省人民政府聘请。在产生代表的同时，大会筹备委员会即通知各地收集提案。大会筹备委员会在筹备期间，曾草拟了“平原省人民政府组织暂行条例”、“平原省各界人民代表会议组织暂行条例”、“平原省人民政府主席、副主席、委员选举办法”等七个重要文件；筹备委员会并制发了“关于召开省各界人民代表会议的宣传提纲”，在群众中进行宣传，得到了全省各族各界人民的热烈拥护。
    会议的另一重要特点，是全体代表空前热烈地讨论了中共平原省委员会书记吴德同志关于目前国内外形势的发言、省人民政府晁哲甫主席的政府工作报告和罗玉川副主席的财政工作报告。到会各界代表四百二十五人，带来了一千二百多件提案，提出了关于抗美援朝、镇压反革命、拥军优属、生产建设、民主作风等许多建议和批评的意见。会议的提案审查委员会，非常认真地反复研究，慎重处理各项提案。会议中有一个明确的指导思想，这就是强调代表的提案乃是各界人民对于政府工作的检查和改进的意见；认真处理提案是密切政府与人民联系的关键之一，是政府依靠人民、贯彻民主作风的重要标志之一。因此，会议处理提案的结果，使全体代表一致认为满意。
