　　At the Signing Ceremony of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
    Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government Speaks

　　The Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet has been signed today. This agreement is in the interests of the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people, and therefore also in the interests of all nationalities of the Chinese people. We should warmly celebrate for the people of the whole country and for the Tibetan people. The Tibetan nationality is one of the nationalities with a long history in China. In the cause of creating and developing the great motherland, it has fulfilled its glorious responsibility. However, in the past hundred years, imperialist forces have invaded China and Tibet at the same time, and carried out various provocations. At the same time, the reactionary rule of China, from the Manchu Qing government to the Kuomintang government, on the one hand, succumbed to the imperialist aggression forces, and on the other hand, implemented policies of oppression and division against the Tibetan nationality. The local government of Tibet did not oppose the aggression and provocation of imperialism, but was blinded and influenced by it, causing the Tibetan nationality and people to fall into the abyss of enslavement and suffering. However, the Tibetan people love the motherland and oppose imperialist aggression. When the Chinese People's Liberation War achieved a basic victory in the whole country, overthrew the Kuomintang government, and drove the imperialist aggressive forces out of the Chinese mainland, the national relations within China underwent a fundamental change. On the day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government announced that it would forever abolish the policy of national oppression and replace it with a national policy of equality, fraternity, unity, and mutual assistance among all nationalities in the country, and put it into practice. The vast majority of nationalities in the country, including the Tibetans in Qinghai, Sichuan, and Xikang, have thus gained liberation and freedom, and have implemented or are implementing national regional autonomy. The Tibet region has also been deeply affected. First of all, the Panchen Erdeni declared his support for the Central People's Government a year ago. Subsequently, the People's Liberation Army entered the Changdu area, which was welcomed and supported by the vast majority of the Tibetan people. Under this situation, the Dalai Lama took charge and began to correct the past erroneous policies of the local government of Tibet, accepted the notice of the Central People's Government, and sent a delegation of plenipotentiaries headed by Apé Ngawang Jigme to the Central Government to negotiate on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The plenipotentiaries of the Central People's Government and the plenipotentiaries of the local government of Tibet reached an agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet after a month of contact and negotiation on a friendly basis. This is a victory for the great unity of the Chinese nation, and a serious failure for the imperialist aggressive forces that attempt to obstruct and undermine the peaceful liberation of Tibet. However, the imperialist aggressive forces will not be reconciled. They may continue to carry out new obstructions and sabotage. This requires the people of the whole country, especially the Tibetan people, to pay close attention. In particular, the local government of Tibet should be very vigilant. But no matter what kind of conspiracies and tricks imperialism may use, it is destined to suffer a complete defeat in the face of the great strength of the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people. The Central People's Government must assist the Tibetan people to eliminate the influence of imperialism in Tibet, complete the unification of the territory and sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, protect the national defense of the great motherland, so that the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people will be liberated forever, return to the great family of the motherland, and, with the help of the Central People's Government and the Han nationality, develop their own political, economic, cultural and educational undertakings, and gradually improve and raise their living standards. It is hoped that the local government of Tibet will conscientiously and responsibly implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and do its best to assist the People's Liberation Army in entering Tibet. It is hoped that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni will unite closely and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, work hard for the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

　　在举行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的签字仪式时
    中央人民政府朱德副主席讲话
    中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，今天已经签字了。这个协议符合于西藏民族和西藏人民的利益，因此也符合于全中国各民族人民的利益。我们应该为全国人民，为西藏人民热烈庆贺。西藏民族是中国境内具有悠久历史的民族之一，在创造与发展伟大祖国的事业中，曾经尽了自己的光荣责任，但是近百年来，帝国主义势力侵入中国，同时也侵入了西藏，并进行各种的挑拨离间。同时中国的反动统治，从满清政府以至国民党政府，则一方面屈服于帝国主义侵略势力，另方面对西藏民族实行压迫和离间的政策。而西藏地方政府对于帝国主义的侵略和挑拨，没有加以反对，反而受其蒙蔽和影响，致使西藏民族和人民陷于奴役和痛苦的深渊。但是，西藏人民是爱祖国而反对帝国主义侵略的。当中国人民解放战争在全国范围内取得了基本胜利，打倒了国民党政府，并从中国大陆上驱逐了帝国主义侵略势力之后，中国境内的民族关系即起了根本的变化。中华人民共和国成立之日，中央人民政府即宣布永远毁除民族压迫政策，而代之以国内各民族平等、友爱、团结、互助的民族政策，并将其付诸实施。全国绝大多数民族包括青海、四川、西康地区的藏族在内，因此获得了解放和自由，已经实行或正在实行民族的区域自治。西藏地区亦受了深刻的影响，首先班禅额尔德尼于一年以前宣布拥护中央人民政府，随后人民解放军进入昌都一带地区，更受到广大西藏人民的欢迎和拥护。在这种情况下，达赖喇嘛亲政，开始改正西藏地方政府以往的错误政策，接受中央人民政府的通知，派遣了以阿沛·阿旺晋美为首的全权代表团来到中央，谈判关于和平解放西藏的办法。中央人民政府的全权代表和西藏地方政府的全权代表双方在友好的基础上，经过一个月的接触和谈判，达成了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。这是中国民族大团结的胜利，对于妄图阻扰和破坏西藏和平解放的帝国主义侵略势力，则是一个严重的失败。但是帝国主义侵略势力是不会甘心的，它还可能继续进行新的阻扰和破坏，这需要全国人民，尤其是西藏人民密切注意，特别是西藏地方政府应该十分加以警惕。但不论帝国主义还会使用什么样的阴谋诡计，在中国人民包括西藏人民在内的伟大力量面前，注定要遭受到彻底的失败。中央人民政府一定要援助西藏人民清除帝国主义在西藏的影响，完成中华人民共和国领土和主权的统一，保护伟大祖国的国防，使西藏民族和西藏人民永远获得解放，回到伟大祖国大家庭中，在中央人民政府和汉民族的帮助下，发展自己的政治、经济和文化教育事业，逐步地改善与提高自己的生活水平。希望西藏地方政府切实负责地执行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，尽力协助人民解放军开入西藏。希望达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密地团结起来，在中央人民政府领导之下，为和平解放西藏而努力。（附图片）
