Welcome the Returning Delegation to North Korea

The Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea returned to Beijing yesterday. All comrades of the delegation, braving hardships and dangers, conveyed the love and sympathy of all the Chinese people to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people at the forefront of the war against America and in the rural areas and factories of Korea. They have now victoriously completed their mission and returned home, and all the Chinese people express warm welcome and respect to them. We offer our deep condolences to the four martyrs of the delegation who heroically sacrificed themselves while working on the Korean front: Comrades Liao Henglu, Chang Baokun, Cheng Shutang, and Wang Ligao!

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are fighting heroically on the Korean front to resist the aggression of American imperialism, and have achieved brilliant victories in succession. During the period of the Chinese People's Delegation's visit to Korea, the Chinese and Korean People's forces launched two powerful counterattacks against the enemy from April 22 to May 21, annihilating 46,302 American invading troops and Li's puppet army. The victory of the Chinese and Korean People's forces in the war against America, especially the heroic actions of the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in resisting America and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend their country, have resulted in a decisive defeat of the American aggression plan in Asia. According to a recent confession by Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, the total number of casualties of the American troops invading Korea on the Korean battlefield has reached 141,955. This heavy loss of the American army has intensified the contradictions within the imperialist camp and within the American ruling group, leading to disintegration and endless disputes. These disputes fully expose the predicament of American imperialism, which is eager to expand the war of aggression but is unable to do so. This situation infinitely encourages the victorious confidence of the world's people in the struggle to defend peace. Therefore, the heroes of the Chinese and Korean People's forces have been respected and admired by the people all over the world. The Chinese people have infinite love for the outstanding sons and daughters of their motherland—the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—as well as the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, and are filled with gratitude and pride for their heroic achievements. The Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea was entrusted by all the Chinese people to convey this feeling of gratitude and love to the Chinese and Korean soldiers fighting on the anti-American front and to the Korean people.

The comrades of the delegation endured hardships in Korea and actively carried out the tasks entrusted to them by the people of their motherland. They were warmly welcomed by the soldiers and civilians of the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the Korean people on the Korean front, in rural areas, and in factories. They not only brought the concern and love of all the Chinese people, but also brought the firm will of all the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea and the immensely powerful support to the anti-American front. This is a tremendous force, which greatly encouraged the Chinese and Korean People's forces and the Korean people in their confidence in winning the war against America, and strengthened their higher and persistent fighting will. The love and concern of the people of the motherland were particularly exciting to the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They expressed their determination to completely liberate the whole of Korea in response to the visit of the representatives of the people of their motherland.

The delegation met with General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, in Korea, and conveyed the respect of the Chinese people to the fighting Korean people. This has further consolidated the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, which is cemented by blood. The Korean people are grateful for the assistance of the Chinese people and for the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. This internationalist friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people is the source of endless strength to defeat American imperialism.

The comrades of the delegation have completed a great task. However, another great task is waiting for the comrades of the delegation to continue to complete. That is to publicize the real situation of the anti-American war in Korea to the people of the whole country. The so-called real situation of the Korean War is that American imperialism should not only be defeated but has already been defeated, the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and the brutal atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea. To publicize these facts widely and deeply to the people of the whole country will inspire the people of the whole country with greater hatred for American imperialism under the inspiration of the heroic fighting spirit of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, especially their own volunteer heroes, and deepen the great patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea. With the deepening of this movement, the Chinese people will unleash a more powerful force to support the Chinese and Korean People's Army to eliminate more American aggressors and strive for the early arrival of the final victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea.

　　欢迎赴朝慰问团返京
    中国人民赴朝慰问团已于昨日返抵北京。慰问团全体同志，不避艰险，将全中国人民对中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民的热爱和慰问，带到了抗美战争的最前线和朝鲜的农村和工厂，现已胜利地完成任务归国，全中国人民都对他们表示热烈的欢迎与敬意。对于在朝鲜前线工作期间英勇牺牲的慰问团团员：廖亨禄同志、常宝坤同志、程树棠同志、王利高同志四位烈士，谨致以沉痛的哀悼！
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，在朝鲜前线为抗击美帝国主义的侵略而英勇地战斗着，并已连续取得了辉煌的胜利。就在中国人民慰问团赴朝的期间，中朝人民部队于四月二十二日至五月二十一日，即曾对敌发动两次强大的反击，歼灭美国侵略军和李伪军达四万六千三百零二名。中朝人民部队抗美战争的胜利，特别是中国人民志愿军勇士们抗美援朝保家卫国的英雄行为，已使得美国在亚洲的侵略计划遭到决定性的败北。仅据最近美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷的供认，朝鲜战场上侵朝美军的伤亡总数已达十四万一千九百五十五人。美国军队这种惨重的损失，使帝国主义阵营内部和美国统治集团内部矛盾日益尖锐，而陷于分崩离析，争吵不已。这些争吵，充分暴露出美国帝国主义急欲扩大侵略战争而又力不从心的窘相。这种形势，无限地鼓舞着世界人民保卫和平斗争的胜利信心。因此，中朝人民部队的英雄们受到了全世界人民的敬爱和钦佩。中国人民对于自己祖国的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军的战士们以及朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，怀着无限的热爱，对他们的英雄业绩充满了感激与自傲。中国人民赴朝慰问团就是受了全中国人民的委托，将这种感激与热爱的情意带给抗美前线的中朝战士和朝鲜人民，而到朝鲜去的。
    慰问团的同志们在朝鲜历尽艰辛，积极地执行了祖国人民所委托给他们的任务。他们在朝鲜前线、农村与工厂，受到中朝人民部队将士们和朝鲜人民热烈的欢迎。他们不但带去了全中国人民的关怀与热爱，同时也把全中国人民抗美援朝的坚决意志与对抗美前线壮大无比的支援力量，带给了前方。这是一个巨大的力量，这个力量大大地鼓舞了中朝人民部队和朝鲜人民对抗美战争的胜利信心，并加强了他们更高的、持久不懈的战斗意志。对于中国人民志愿军的英雄们，祖国人民的热爱与关怀，特别使他们兴奋。他们曾表示以彻底解放全朝鲜的决心，来回答祖国人民代表的访问。
    慰问团在朝鲜曾谒见朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军，并以中国人民的敬意带给了战斗中的朝鲜人民。这就更加巩固了中朝人民用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊。朝鲜人民感谢中国人民的援助，感谢中国人民的领袖毛主席。中朝人民这种国际主义的友爱团结，是战胜美国帝国主义的无尽力量的源泉。
    慰问团同志们已经完成了一个伟大任务。但是，另一个伟大的任务正等待慰问团的同志们继续去完成。那就是把朝鲜抗美战争的实况，向全国人民作宣传。所谓朝鲜战争的实况，即是美帝国主义不但应当被打败而且已经被打败的实况，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军英勇作战的实况，美国侵略者在朝鲜残暴兽行的实况。把这些实况普遍地深入地向全国人民作宣传，将使全国人民在中朝人民部队，特别是自己的志愿军英雄们英勇战斗精神的鼓舞之下，激发起对美帝国主义的更大仇恨，深入抗美援朝的伟大爱国运动。随着这个运动的深入，中国人民将发出更强大的力量，以支援中朝人民军更多地消灭美国侵略者，争取抗美援朝战争最后胜利的早日到来。
