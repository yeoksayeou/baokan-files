The Workers' Daily
Beijing Workers' Daily published an editorial calling for doing a good job in promoting the implementation of the trade union membership fee coupon system. The editorial stated:

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in order to strengthen the management of trade union funds and further improve trade union financial work, has decided to adopt a membership fee coupon system with emphasis from July 1st. This is a good method to unify and simplify the collection of membership fees by absorbing the advanced experience of Soviet trade unions in collecting membership fees. Adopting a membership fee coupon system has many benefits:

First, when trade unions collect membership fees from members, they must first purchase membership fee coupons from the People's Bank of China and paste the membership fee coupons on the membership cards. This not only facilitates checking the payment of membership fees by members, but also prevents individual trade union cadres from embezzling membership fees, ensuring the collection of membership fees.

Second, trade unions use cash to purchase membership fee coupons from the treasury, which can promote currency withdrawal.

Third, the adoption of the membership fee coupon system can achieve unified collection, expenditure, storage, allocation, and use of membership fees, enabling trade union funds to better embark on the road of independence and self-sufficiency.

Fourth, membership fee coupons are uniformly issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. This can strengthen the overall thinking and organizational concept of the national working class, strengthen their care for trade union organizations, and promote the consolidation of trade union organizations.

Therefore, the membership fee coupon system should be well promoted throughout the country. At present, in order to take care of the practical difficulties faced by grassroots trade union organizations and bank branches in various places during implementation, a key promotion method is first adopted in order to absorb experience and gradually promote it.

　　采用会费券的好处
    工人日报
    北京工人日报发表社论，号召做好推行工会会费券的工作。社论称：
    全国总工会为了加强工会经费的管理，进一步搞好工会财务工作，决定从七月一日起有重点地采用会费券制。这是吸收了苏联工会征收会费的先进经验，统一和简化征收会费的好办法。采用会费券制，有这样许多好处：
    第一、工会向会员征收会费必须先向中国人民银行购买会费券，并把会费券黏贴在会员证上，这样，不但便于检查会员缴纳会费的情况，也可以杜绝个别工会干部贪污会费的现象，使征收会费得到保证。
    第二、工会用现金向金库购买会费券，可以促使货币回笼。
    第三、采用会费券制，可以做到会费的统一收支保管和调拨运用，使工会经费更好地走上独立自给的道路。
    第四、会费券由全国总工会统一发行。可以加强全国工人阶级的整体思想和组织观念，加强其对于工会组织的爱护，并能促使巩固工会组织。
    因此，会费券制应该在全国各地很好推行。目前为了照顾各地工会基层组织和银行分支机构在实施上的困难，先采取重点推行办法，以便吸收经验，逐步推广。
