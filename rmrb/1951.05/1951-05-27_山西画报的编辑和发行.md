　　Editing and Distribution of the Shanxi Pictorial
    Li Qun
            I. Determining the Target Audience and Purpose
    The primary audience of the "Shanxi Pictorial" is farmers. Farmers can be roughly divided into three categories: first, the illiterate, who cannot read a single word, accounting for more than 60% of all farmers; second, the semi-literate, who can recognize very few characters, accounting for about 35% of all farmers; and third, farmer intellectuals, who can understand "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin," accounting for about 5% of all farmers. The "Shanxi Pictorial" aims to be understandable to the second and third types of farmers, and for the first type, understandable through the pictures and explanations.
    To create a pictorial for farmers, the following two issues must be resolved first: first, cadres must genuinely want to do this popularization work and be determined to do it well, clear their minds, put aside their airs, and not regard this as a trivial job. Today, creating a pictorial for Chinese farmers cannot be like the large-format "People's Pictorial." To take into account the farmers' purchasing power and literacy level, we can only create a small, single-sheet pictorial. This single-sheet pictorial naturally doesn't have much grandeur, like a small donkey, although it's not as imposing as a tall horse, the farmers like it very much.
    Second, we must consider the farmers' needs in every aspect, conduct investigations and research, and understand their needs. If we cannot consider the farmers' needs in every aspect, this pictorial will not be welcomed by the farmers. If we do not understand the situation at all times, this pictorial will not be able to continuously improve and enhance itself.
    The comrades of the "Shanxi Pictorial" have appropriately resolved the above two issues, although it cannot be said that they have been resolved very well.
    Why create this pictorial? What role can it play? All comrades must thoroughly understand this question. If they do not understand this question, they will lack enthusiasm, confidence, and a clear direction. Today, when we create a pictorial for farmers, it is certainly not intended as a form of entertainment for them. We should first help farmers solve their production problems, ideological problems, and popularize their political knowledge. At the same time, we should also have such a grand goal: to bring farmers from the New Democratic society to a socialist society. Today, preparing conditions for the future socialist society, of course, we must first carry out economic construction, prepare material conditions, and at the same time, we must carry out cultural education among farmers, prepare ideological conditions. Today, most farmers are illiterate and love to look at pictures, so we use pictures to guide them to organize themselves to work and produce, and at the same time, we must educate them, so that they can see a bright future and start working hard today for this future.
            II. Considering Farmers' Needs in Every Aspect
    The working comrades of the "Shanxi Pictorial" have recognized the importance of creating a farmer's pictorial, so they can carry out their work with a more serious attitude. We have learned from the "People's Pictorial" of the former Jin-Sui Border Region era and the "Inner Mongolia Pictorial," and absorbed some of their experiences. In order to suit the reading habits of farmers, we have decided on the following content and form:
    (1) We adopted a quarto single-sheet format, not a booklet. Booklets are costly, expensive, and cannot be pasted on the wall. This format is currently not suitable for farmers with many illiterates. The biggest advantage of a single-sheet pictorial is that it can be pasted on the wall for everyone to see. The cost is low, and the price is also low. Our pictorial was priced at 600 yuan per sheet when millet was 540 yuan per catty. Later, when millet rose to more than 1,000 yuan per catty, we did not raise the price. Now that millet is more than 800 yuan per catty, our pictorial still sells for 600 yuan per sheet because there are more subscribers, and we do not lose money.
    (2) We resolutely do not use photographs. Photographs are not easy to turn into comic strips, and it is not easy to print them in color. In addition, they have light and dark sides, and if the printing is not good, they become a dark mess, which farmers do not like to see. Moreover, if we use photographs, we cannot cultivate a large number of amateur art workers among the masses through the pictorial.
    (3) We use three-color comic strips as the main content. Farmers like to see red and green pictures the most, and the brighter the colors, the more popular they are. They love to watch comic strips even more. Comic strips can illustrate the development process of things, and they have a great educational effect. Because the subscribers of the pictorial are not very fixed, he subscribed to this issue, and he may not subscribe to the next issue. And people always want to finish reading a story at once, so the comic strip must be published all at once.
    (4) Most of the pictures are drawn in the popular folk single-line flat-painting style, without using Western chiaroscuro. This has four advantages: it is easy for the painter to handle the picture neatly, beautifully, simply, and clearly; it is easy for the printing factory to make plates and print clearly; farmers like to see it; and it is easy for those who learn to paint to follow.
    (5) The layout strives for "cleanliness and clarity, rather be rigid than chaotic." In order to make it clear to farmers at a glance, it is not allowed to innovate in the layout and play tricks, so that farmers cannot find the beginning and end. We have seen some pictorials whose layouts can be of different sizes, some square and some round, and the explanations are not connected with the pictures. This method is intentionally making things difficult for farmers, and it is really not good-looking, so we take honesty and simplicity as the foundation.
    (6) To make it understandable for illiterate and semi-literate farmers, we do not publish articles on the front. In order to contact art workers in the whole province, we use the back of the pictorial to publish articles. The explanation of the comic strip strives to be popular and concise. We have sometimes thought of adopting larger fonts and using explanations in the style of clapper rhymes and songs, but the former has not been resolved due to concerns that the font is too large and the size of the picture will be reduced, and the latter has not been achieved due to insufficient conditions. These difficulties must be overcome in the future.
    (7) We also publish current affairs cartoons sometimes. However, the cartoons for farmers should be drawn extremely popularly and easily understood, with more explanations. Farmers have low cultural levels, and they do not understand that white pigeons represent peace, the swastika represents fascism, the lion represents British imperialism, let alone who MacArthur is. Of course, our general cartoons are not easy for them to accept. But if someone explains it to them, they can also understand.
    (8) The "Shanxi Pictorial" always replies to letters from the masses. For the submitted paintings that are decided to be used, it is inevitable to make modifications, but the principle is to preserve the spirit of the original as much as possible, and the changes should not be too much. For the unused manuscripts, we must point out the shortcomings and explain the reasons for not using them. It is only because there are too many letters and not enough staff that we cannot reply in time.
            III. Closely Integrating with Reality
    The "Shanxi Pictorial" is a newspaper in nature, and it needs to be closely integrated with reality. First of all, it should cooperate with every movement. For example, after the movement to ban the Yiguandao sect in our province began, the pictorial published a large number of pictures exposing the crimes of the Yiguandao; when the provincial congress of model workers in industry and agriculture was held, a special issue for model workers was published; when winter schools started, the slogan of serving winter schools was put forward. At present, we are focusing on linking with industrial and agricultural production, deeply promoting the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and strengthening patriotic ideological education. It is also the method we have carried out and are carrying out to carry out political education among farmers with appropriate themes in cooperation with each festival. In 1950, we published special issues for "May Day," "Children's Day," "Party Founding Day," "Army Day," "National Day," and "October Revolution Day." For example, on May Day, we published all the content about workers (we also published a small part of it at ordinary times), wanting to let farmers understand the vanguard role of the working class, recognize that the working class is the leading class, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. Since entering the city, we have introduced a lot of rural areas to the city. Now, it is very necessary to introduce the city to the countryside appropriately, because farmers do not understand the city, so they do not recognize the city's leadership over the countryside. Moreover, we also print more May Day special issues and distribute them to factories, paste them on the streets, as a service to workers. Although our pictorial is mainly aimed at farmers, rural primary school children are also important readers, and it is also very necessary to publish a special issue for Children's Day to serve children, because publishing a special issue for rural primary school students is equivalent to publishing a special issue for farmers' sons, and farmers will raise their hands in approval. As for "Party Founding Day," it is extremely important to publicize the great leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to farmers, "Army Day" publicizes the heroic and good fighting of the People's Liberation Army to farmers, defending the motherland, "National Day" publicizes the greatness of the motherland, and "October Revolution Day" publicizes the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, because these special issues are good opportunities to carry out political and ideological education among farmers. After the land reform, the political atmosphere in the rural areas of Shanxi gradually weakened. In the future, we must link with the rural economy and farmers' production to strengthen political propaganda, so that production and construction work and the overall political tasks are combined.
    In addition, we feel that we should strengthen the news value of the pictorial as much as possible, that is, we should publish more news paintings with time, county name, village name, and person name. Publishing more news paintings has two advantages. The first is that it is easy to make the pictorial penetrate into the masses and take root among the masses. Real people and real events are of particular interest to farmers, and if the affairs of that village are published, the masses of that village will pay more attention to the pictorial. The second is that it is easy to cultivate amateur art workers among the masses and transform folk artists through the pictorial. News-oriented manuscripts mainly rely on submissions from amateur art workers from all over the province. However, when publishing news-oriented manuscripts, we should pay attention to preventing the "empty talk" phenomenon, which is very damaging to the credibility of the pictorial.
    The art workers of the "Shanxi Pictorial" must be familiar with the life of workers and peasants. If they are not familiar with the life of workers and peasants, they cannot draw, revise, or review manuscripts. Therefore, we have decided to continuously change shifts to go to the countryside and factories to learn from the masses and enrich ourselves. At present, those of us who do editing work have deeply felt the pain of lacking scientific and life knowledge. For example, in comic strips about factories, we find it difficult to judge whether the machines are drawn correctly or not, and whether there are errors in the explanatory text. Things like kilowatts and carbonization are all new terms to us. In order to avoid errors, we first ask workers and technicians to look at the manuscripts. (Editor's note: Since the target audience of the "Shanxi Pictorial" is mainly farmers, these industrial terms should not only be accurate, but also appropriately explained so that farmers can understand them.)
            IV. Attaching Importance to Printing and Distribution
    Printing and distribution work should be given great importance. If the painting is good but the printing is not good, the farmers will not like to see it; if the printing is good but it cannot be distributed, it will not reach the farmers.
    We pay close attention to the printing work of the pictorial. In order to make the pictorial printed clearly and beautifully, we often run to the factory and correct problems immediately when we find them. From the factory management to the workers, the printing factory knows that we treat our work seriously and responsibly, and they also work more seriously and responsibly.
    One month after the "Shanxi Pictorial" was founded, it had 2,125 subscribers. How did it get it? This pictorial was initially distributed by the distribution section of the "Shanxi Daily." At the time of its founding, it was given away with the "Shanxi Farmer's Daily" for two issues (each issue was given away about 10,000 copies), and a letter was attached stating that the free distribution would be stopped from the third issue and asking everyone to subscribe (and attaching the subscription method). In this way, the initial 2,000 basic subscribers were obtained by the third issue. We once hoped that the Shanxi branch of Xinhua Bookstore would sell it for us, but it failed: we got their consent and sent 3,000 copies of each issue, hoping to send them to the branch stores in various places, but after a few months, these pictorials were still unopened and placed in the library as they were. (Editor's note: The Shanxi branch of Xinhua Bookstore should review this matter.)
    So we distributed it ourselves for a period of time, laid the foundation with various methods, and then it was distributed by the post office, and it has developed to more than 15,000 subscribers recently.
    After it was distributed by the post office, some problems also occurred. The post office stipulates that you can only pre-order the pictorial for the next month from the 1st to the 5th of each month, and you cannot order it after the deadline; and you can only pre-order it for one month, and you cannot order it for several months in a row. As a result, the farmers reacted very dissatisfied. Secondly, sometimes it cannot be delivered, so some farmers are unwilling to pre-order, and they ask the post office to sell it retail, and they are willing to pay for the goods, just like buying a box of matches. Farmers are not used to pre-ordering publications. Some of the above problems have been discussed with the post office and resolved, and some are being solved. In short, we feel that some county post offices still lack a mass perspective and cannot consider the needs of the farmers in every aspect. They use the working methods of the city to treat farmers, and do not consider the inconvenience of rural transportation and the difficulty of farmers entering the city. We hope that the post office will pay attention to popular reading materials in the future and think of more ways in distribution work.

　　山西画报的编辑和发行
    力群
            一、确定对象与目的
    《山西画报》的主要对象是农民。农民大致有这么三种人：第一种是文盲，即一字不识的，约占全部农民的百分之六十以上；第二种是半文盲，即能认识很少的字的，约占全部农民的百分之三十五左右；第三种是农民知识分子，即能够看懂《三国演义》和《水浒传》的，约占全部农民的百分之五左右。《山西画报》想做到第二三种农民看得懂，第一种农民看得懂画，听得懂说明。
    要为农民办画报，必须先解决以下两个问题：第一是干部要真正愿意做这个普及工作，并下决心做好，打通思想，放下架子，不把这当做渺小的工作。给今天的中国农民办画报，当然不能办《人民画报》式的大型画报，为了照顾农民的购买力和文化水平，只能办一种小型的单张画报。这种单张的画报气派自然不大，有如一头小小的毛驴，虽然不象高头大马那样神气，农民却很喜欢。
    第二是要处处为农民设想，进行调查研究，了解他们的需要。为农民办画报，如果不能处处为农民设想，这个画报是不会受农民欢迎的。如果不随时了解情况，这个画报是无法不断改进，不断提高的。
    《山西画报》社的同志们已经适当地解决了以上两个问题，虽然不能说已经解决的很好。
    为什么要办这个画报呢？它能起什么作用呢？这个问题也必须使全体同志彻底了解，假如不了解这个问题，办起来就没劲，没有信心，更没有明确的方向。我们今天为农民办画报，当然不是为了作农民的消遣品，我们首先应帮助农民解决生产问题、思想问题和普及他们的政治知识。同时，还应该有这样远大的目标：把农民们从新民主主义社会带到社会主义社会去。今天为未来的社会主义准备条件，首先当然要进行经济建设，准备物质条件，同时也必须向农民进行文化教育，准备思想条件。今天农民多半是文盲，爱看画，我们就用图画来引导他们组织起来劳动生产，同时还要教育他们，使他们看得到美满的前途，并为了这个前途而在今天就开始努力。
            二、处处为农民设想
    《山西画报》社的工作同志们，既已认识了办农民画报的重要性，因此就能以比较严肃的态度来进行工作。我们曾向前晋绥边区时代的《人民画报》学习，向《内蒙画报》学习，吸取了它们的一些经验。为了适合农民阅读，我们决定了以下的内容和形式：
    （一）采取了四开单张的形式，不用本本。本本成本大，价钱高，又不能在墙上贴。这种形式在目前是不适合于文盲多的农民阅读的。单张画报的最大好处是能够贴在墙上让大家看。成本低，定价也低。我们的画报当小米每斤五百四十元时，定价卖六百元一张，后来小米涨到一千多元一斤，我们也不涨价，现在小米一斤八百余元，我们的画报因订户多了，所以还是卖六百元一张，并不赔钱。
    （二）坚决不用照片。照片不易做到连环故事化，又不易印彩色，加之有阴阳面，印刷不好成为黑黑的一片，农民不喜欢看；而且采用了照片，就不能通过画报大量培养群众的业余美术工作者。
    （三）用三色套版的连环图画为主要内容。农民最喜欢看红红绿绿的图画，色彩愈鲜艳愈受欢迎。他们更爱看连环图画，连环图画能够说明事物发展的过程，教育作用很大。因为画报的订户很不固定，这期他订了，下期就不一定订。而且人们总是愿意一次把一个故事看完的，所以连环图画要一次登完。
    （四）图画大部是以民间流行的单线平涂的画法画的，不用西洋的明暗法。这有四种好处：画的人容易把画面处理得干净、漂亮、单纯、明快；印刷厂也易于制版，又容易印的清楚；农民喜欢看；学画的人容易跟上学。
    （五）排版力求“整洁醒目，宁板勿乱”。为了使农民一目了然，不允许在排版上标新立异，玩弄花样，使农民寻不见头尾。我们曾经看到有些画报的版式，一套连环图画可以大小不一，有方有圆，说明也不和画连在一起。这样的办法是有意给农民吃苦头，实在也不好看，所以我们以老实朴素为本。
    （六）要使文盲和半文盲的农民听懂看懂，因此在正面不登文章，为了和全省的美术工作者联系，利用画报的背面登文章。连环图画的说明力求通俗字少。有时也曾想采取较大一些的字体，并用快板和歌谣式的说明，但前者因顾虑字体大了，画的篇幅要减少，尚未解决，后者也因条件不足，还未能做到。这些困难以后定要设法克服。
    （七）有时也登载时事漫画。但给农民看的漫画，要画得极其通俗易懂，多加说明。农民文化低，他们不懂得白鸽子代表和平，?字代表法西斯，狮子代表英帝国主义，更不知道麦克阿瑟是何人，当然我们的一般漫画就不容易使他们接受了。但假如有一个人给他们解释，他们也是可以领会的。
    （八）《山西画报》对于群众来信，总是答复的。来了的画稿，决定用的，就难免要修改，但以尽量保留原作的精神为原则，更改之处不得过多。不用的稿子一定给指出缺点，并说明不用之理由。只因目前来信过多，工作人员少不能即时答复是有的。
            三、紧密结合实际
    《山西画报》是报纸性质的，更需要与实际紧密的结合，首先是配合每一运动。例如本省取缔一贯道的运动开始后，画报就以大量篇幅登载揭发一贯道罪恶的图画；全省工农业劳模大会举行了，就出劳模特刊；冬学开学了，就提出为冬学服务的口号。目前我们把注重点放在联系工农业生产，深入抗美援朝与严厉镇压反革命的宣传、加强爱国主义思想教育等上面。以适当的题材配合每一节日，向农民进行政治教育，也是我们进行过和进行着的方法。一九五○年我们一共出版了“五一”“六一”“七一”“八一”“国庆节”，“十月革命节”等特刊。例如五一节，我们就全部刊登关于工人的内容，（平时也刊登一少部分）想让农民了解工人阶级的先锋作用，认识工人阶级是领导阶级，加强工农联盟。进城以来，我们把农村向城市介绍的很多，现在很需要把城市适当地介绍给农村，因为农民不了解城市，因而不承认城市领导乡村。而且五一节特刊我们也多印一些发给工厂，贴在街头，作为给工人服务。我们的画报虽然主要对象是农民，可是农村小学儿童也是重要读者，六一儿童节出特刊为儿童服务也很必要，因为给农村小学生出一期特刊，也就等于是给农民的儿子出特刊，农民会举起双手赞成的。至于“七一”向农民宣传共产党和毛主席的伟大领导作用，“八一”向农民宣传人民解放军的英勇善战，保卫祖国，“国庆节”宣传祖国的伟大，“十月革命节”宣传中苏友好，这都是极其重要的，因为通过这些特刊正是向农民进行政治思想教育的好机会。土地改革之后，山西农村中政治空气逐渐淡薄，今后必须联系农村经济和农民生产，加强政治宣传，使生产建设工作和总的政治任务结合起来。
    此外，我们觉得应尽量加强画报的新闻性，就是应多发表有时间，有县名、村名、人名的新闻画稿。多登新闻画稿有两种好处，第一是易于使画报深入群众，在群众中生根。真人真事，是农民特别感到兴趣的，而且登了那个村子的事情，那个村子的群众就会更关心画报。第二是容易培养群众的业余美术工作者，并通过画报改造民间艺人。新闻性的稿子主要依靠全省各地业余美术工作者的投稿。但发表新闻性的稿子时，应注意防止“客里空”现象，这现象对画报的威信有很大损害。
    《山西画报》社的美术工作者必须熟悉工农生活。不熟悉工农生活就无法作画、改稿、审稿。因此我们决定不断换班下乡、下工厂，向群众学习，丰富自己。目前我们做编辑工作的人，已深深地感到科学和生活知识贫乏的痛苦，例如关于工厂的连环图画，机器画的正确不正确，说明文字是否有错误，我们很难判断，象什么基罗瓦特呀，什么碳化呀……在我们说来都是新名词。为了避免错误，我们就把画稿先请工人和技术人员看过。（编者按：《山西画报》的读者对象既然主要是农民，对这些工业术语，不但要求正确，而且应该适当地予以解释，使农民能懂。）
            四、重视印刷重视发行
    印刷和发行的工作，都要十分重视。假如画的好，印不好，农民就不喜欢看；印的好发不下去就到不了农民手里。
    我们很注意画报的印刷工作。为了使画报印的清楚漂亮，我们经常跑工厂，发现问题立刻改正。印刷厂从厂方到工人，知道我们对待工作是严肃负责的，他们也就更认真负责地工作了。
    《山西画报》创刊一月后，就拥有二千一百二十五个订户，这是怎么得来的呢？这个画报最初由《山西日报》社发行科代发，创刊的时候就随着《山西农民报》赠送了两期（每期赠送约一万多份），并附信说明：自第三期起即停止赠送，请大家订阅（并附订阅的办法），这样到第三期就获得了最初的两千多基本订户。我们曾希望新华书店山西分店给我们代售，但是失败了：我们得了他们的同意，每期送去三千份，希望发到各地支店，可是过了几个月去看，这些画报仍然包绳未解，原封不动地放在藏书室里。（编者按：新华书店山西分店对此事应加检讨。）
    于是我们自己发行了一个时期，用各种方法打下了基础，以后才由邮局发行，发展到最近的一万五千多订户。
    在由邮局发行之后，也曾发生过一些问题。邮局规定只许每月一日至五日预订下一月的画报，过期不订；而且只能预订一个月的，不能连订数月。于是农民反映很不满意。其次是有时候送不到，因此有些农民不愿预订，向邮局要求零卖，他们愿意交款拿货，象买一盒火柴一般。农民对于预订刊物原来还不习惯的。以上问题，有的已和邮局商量解决了，有的正在设法解决。总之我们觉得有些县的邮局还缺乏群众观点，不能处处为农民群众设想，他们采用城市的工作方法对待农民，不考虑农村交通不便，农民进城困难等问题。希望邮局今后能重视通俗读物，在发行工作上多想办法。
