[Xinhua News Agency dispatch] Spanish workers spent this year's May Day in the midst of a heroic struggle against the Franco regime. The Spanish dictator Franco, fearing that the people would demonstrate on May Day, had taken "emergency measures" in advance. On the one hand, he ordered a strict ban on celebrating May Day, and on the other hand, he transferred a large number of troops to major industrial centers, and specially dispatched his capable henchmen to various factories to strengthen suppression and surveillance. At the same time, the U.S. Mediterranean garrison authorities also sent bombers to intimidate over Barcelona.

But all this could not stop the Spanish people's angry resistance to Franco's tyranny. On May Day, in Barcelona alone, 12,000 workers went on strike, and the workers held their own conferences in the factories. Leaflets were scattered everywhere in the city, calling on people to rise up against the Franco regime. The Spanish people have turned May Day into a day to fight against the Franco regime.

　　西班牙工人在五一节罢工
    反对佛朗哥法西斯政权
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西班牙今年的五一节是在西班牙人民反对佛朗哥政权的英勇斗争中渡过的。西班牙独裁者佛朗哥由于害怕人民在五一节示威，曾事先采取了“紧急措施”。他一面下令严禁庆祝五一节，一面把大批军队赶调到各大工业中心，并特别派遣了他的得力爪牙到各工厂去，加强镇压和监视。同时，美国地中海驻军当局也派出了轰炸机到巴塞罗那上空恫吓。
    但是所有这一切都阻止不住西班牙人民对佛朗哥暴政的愤怒反抗。在五一节，仅仅在巴塞罗那一地，就有一万二千工人举行了罢工，工人在工厂里自己举行了大会。城内到处散发着传单，号召人们起来反对佛朗哥政权。西班牙人民已把五一节变成了为反对佛朗哥政权而斗争的日子。
