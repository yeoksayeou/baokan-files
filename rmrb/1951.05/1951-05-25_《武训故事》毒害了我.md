　　《The Story of Wu Xun》Poisoned Me
    Jie Fangmin
            I have admired Wu Xun since I was a child
    Although I haven't seen the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," I read "The Story of Wu Xun" in my elementary school Chinese textbook. At that time, the teacher greatly praised this "eternal strange beggar" and asked us to learn from him. Therefore, it left a very deep impression on me. I remember when I got home from school, I asked my father to tell me in detail the miracles of this "strange beggar." In this way, the figure of Wu Xun, this "hero," was engraved on my young mind, and Wu Xun was regarded as a "great man" who could endure hardship and abuse, and who ran schools for the common people (I didn't know the word "people" at the time). I remember my father said at the time: "I will also run schools like Wu Xun in the future." I also happily said: "It's amazing that Dad wants to run schools like Wu Xun!" At that time, I also expressed that when I grow up, I would also be an educator like Wu Xun. But there were still some things I didn't understand, and I asked my father: "Why doesn't Wu Xun get angry when he is beaten, scolded, and made to kneel?" My father replied: "Ambitious people don't care about these little things. Didn't Han Xin suffer the humiliation of crawling between someone's legs, but he eventually accomplished great things? Heaven will entrust great responsibilities to such a person! Only by enduring the bitterness of bitterness can one become a man above men." I was very satisfied with my father's explanation. Since then, Wu Xun has become the "great man" I admire most, and I even think Wu Xun is much greater than Yue Fei, whom I admired before.
            I once distorted the theory of "Marxism-Leninism" to praise Wu Xun
    When I heard that "The Life of Wu Xun" was made into a movie, I was very happy. I thought, "Only in the new society will such a great hero as Wu Xun be valued by the people and be brought to the screen." Later, I regretted not taking the time to see the film. So I read the articles praising Wu Xun in the newspapers very carefully to make up for the loss of not seeing the movie. Indeed, I originally agreed with such praise of Wu Xun: "Wu Xun is a representative of the peasants," "Wu Xun is wholeheartedly serving the working people," "Wu Xun is an excellent representative of Chinese cultural traditions!" And I also admired the "class stand" and "materialist viewpoint" of these "writers." Although I once thought that such a "lowly" person as Wu Xun was not someone a Communist Party member should learn from. But I was immediately defeated by the thought of admiring Wu Xun, and blindly praised Wu Xun as standing on the side of the working people and serving the working people. And I misinterpreted Lenin's teachings: Revolutionary workers must not only be good at attacking, but also learn necessary compromises, and even temporary retreats. Wu Xun has such a spirit: for the "great" purpose of running schools, he can endure abuse and humiliation and seek perfection. This is the "greatness" of Wu Xun. In this way, my suspicion of Wu Xun turned into praise of Wu Xun.
            Wu Xun's thought has affected my fighting spirit
    After reading Comrade Yang Er's article "Does Mr. Tao Xingzhi's Praise of the 'Spirit of Wu Xun' Have a Positive Effect?", my thoughts were initially only disordered. Later, after reading the editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Movie 'The Life of Wu Xun'," I became alert from the disorder and realized that this was not only a problem of understanding Wu Xun as an individual, but a problem of the position, viewpoint, and method of a Communist Party member, and a problem of using non-proletarian positions, viewpoints, and methods to praise historical figures who should not be praised. In childhood, it can be said that I blindly worshiped Wu Xun because I received a feudal education. But after joining the Communist Party and receiving the party's Marxist-Leninist education, how could I wrongly praise Wu Xun in this way? And I also believed that this understanding was very in line with Marxist-Leninist principles. Not only that, but the spirit of Wu Xun also affected my fighting spirit and developed my liberalism. Ah, where has the Marxism-Leninism I learned gone? The bourgeois reformist thought has invaded my mind.
    Now I want to re-study the history of the motherland and study it from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. At the same time, I want to actively participate in this criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun." And I hope that the criticism of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" can become a ideological criticism movement for our Communist Party members and the cultural circles, and an important part of patriotic ideological education. Finally, I also ask the People's Daily to make a summary in the future to educate all party members and people who are willing to make progress, thoroughly eliminate the toxins of Wu Xun's thought, and welcome new combat missions.

### 《武训故事》毒害了我

　　《武训故事》毒害了我
    解方民
            我从小就崇拜武训
    虽然我没有看过《武训传》电影，但我在小学国语课本里读过《武训故事》。当时老师对这位“千古奇丐”大大赞扬，要我们学习。因此给我的印象非常深刻。记得我放学回家后，还要求我父亲把这位“奇丐”的奇迹详细讲了一遍。这样在我幼小的心灵上就刻上了武训这位“英雄”人物，把武训当作是一位能够刻苦耐劳、挨骂受气、为平民（当时还不知道“人民”这个词儿）办学校的“伟大人物”。记得当时父亲还这样说：“我将来也要像武训一样办学校。”我也高兴地说：“爸爸要像武训这样办学校，真了不起！”当时我还表示自己长大后，也要当一个武训这样的教育家。可是我还有点不明白的地方，曾问父亲道：“武训挨打、受骂、下跪，怎么不发脾气呀？”父亲回答道：“有志气的人是不计较这些小事情的。韩信不是受过胯下之辱，但他终久成了大事。天将降大任于是人也！吃得苦中苦，方为人上人。”我对父亲的这个解释非常满意。此后，武训就成为我最崇拜的“伟人”，甚至我觉得武训比我先前崇拜的岳飞伟大得多。
            我曾歪曲“马克思列宁主义”的理论来颂扬武训
    当我听说武训传拍成电影后，我很高兴。我想：“像武训这样伟大的英雄也只有在新社会里才会被人民重视，才能被搬上银幕。”后来又后悔没有抽时间去看一看这部片子。于是很用心来读报上歌颂武训的文字，以弥补未看电影的损失。确实我原同意对武训这样赞扬的：“武训是农民的代表”，“武训是全心全意为劳动人民服务的”，“武训是中国文化传统优秀的代表人物！”并且我还钦佩这些“作家”的“阶级立场”和“唯物观点”。虽然我也曾想到武训这样“低三下四”的人，不是共产党员应该学习的。但又立刻被崇拜武训的思想击败，又盲目地歌颂武训是站在劳动人民一边的，武训是为劳动人民服务的。并曲解列宁教导过我们的：革命工作者不但要善于进攻，而且要学会必要的妥协，甚至暂时的退却。武训就有这样的精神：为了兴学这个“伟大的”目的，自己可以挨骂受气，委曲求全。这就是武训的“伟大”。这样，我对武训的怀疑，又一变为对武训的颂扬。
            武训思想影响了我的斗争性
    在读了杨耳同志的“陶行知先生表扬‘武训精神’有积极作用吗？”一文后，起初思想上还只是紊乱。后来读了“应当重视关于电影《武训传》的讨论”的社论后，才由紊乱而警觉起来，发觉了这确实不仅是对武训个人的认识问题，而是一个共产党员的立场、观点、方法问题，是用非无产阶级的立场、观点、方法来歌颂不应歌颂的历史人物问题。在幼年，固然可以说因为受了封建教育，所以盲目崇拜武训。但在参加共产党，经过党的马克思列宁主义教育后，又怎么会这样错误地颂扬武训。并且还认为这种认识是很符合马克思列宁主义原则的。不但如此，武训的精神，并且影响了我的斗争性，发展了我的自由主义。是啊，我学的马克思列宁主义跑到那儿去了呢？资产阶级的改良主义思想，已侵入到我的思想中了。
    现在我要重新学习祖国的历史，用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法来学习。同时要积极参加这次对《武训传》的批判。并且希望对《武训传》电影的批判，能够成为我们共产党员和文化界的一个思想批判运动，成为爱国主义思想教育的一个重要部分。最后还要求人民日报将来作一个总结，以教育全体党员和愿意进步的人民，彻底肃清武训思想的毒素，迎接新的战斗任务。
