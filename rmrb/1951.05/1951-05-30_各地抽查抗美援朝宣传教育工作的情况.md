After May Day, many regions conducted focused inspections to understand the degree of popularization of anti-American aggression and patriotic education. For example, the Jianyang Special District Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Association and the Jianyang County Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Association jointly formed three inspection teams, which inspected three factories, the urban business community, and a village on the outskirts of the city representative of general rural areas. The Yonghan District Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Branch in Guangzhou City organized more than 150 cadres and students to conduct spot checks on two residential groups with relatively good, average, and poor performance in propaganda and education work within the district. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent cadres to investigate three types of villages in the first district of Xianning County regarding the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement. The secretary of the Baotou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Suiyuan Province personally checked two villages. Some factories in Taiyuan, Xi'an, Shanghai, and other places held current affairs tests. Eleven counties and cities including Guangji and Yingshan in Hubei, the fifth district of Beijing, Jinzhou City in Liaoxi, Nanchang City in Jiangxi, Wuxi City in Southern Jiangsu, Wuzhou City in Guangxi, Luzhou City in Western Sichuan, Xinxiang County in Pingyuan, Linfen County in Shanxi, Tianzhen County in Chahar, Qingjiang City, Taixian County, and Haian County in Northern Jiangsu, Anqing City and Feixi County in Northern Anhui, Hang County and Taizhou in Zhejiang, Jiading and Wenjiang in Western Sichuan, and other places all conducted key inspections. In addition, some cultural and educational institutions, such as the Xi'an Mass Daily, the Mentougou Cultural Center in Beijing, and the Xi'an Municipal First Middle School, conducted surveys among nearby residents.

The methods of inspection in various places generally included holding small mass discussion meetings, casual door-to-door conversations, and individual interviews. Some used written or oral tests.

The inspection results from various regions show the achievements of the previous stage of anti-American aggression and patriotic education work. For example, in Chang'an Street in Jinzhou City, Liaoxi, 85% of the surveyed masses had a preliminary understanding of the basic issues of the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement, of which 5% had a relatively thorough understanding. The results of the spot check of six residential groups of three types in Yonghan District, Guangzhou City, showed that among the 455 people interviewed, 40% knew why to resist American aggression and aid Korea, 36% only knew the words "resist American aggression and defend the homeland" without understanding their meaning, and 24% were still unaware of the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement. According to the key spot checks in eleven counties and cities including Guangji and Yingshan in Hubei Province, 80% of the population in better villages and streets had received anti-American aggression and aid Korea education, while the general rate was 50% to 60%. In urban areas of Southern Jiangsu, the population that received education accounted for about 70% to 80%; in small towns, it was about 60%; in rural areas, it was about 50% in general villages, 70% to 80% in better villages, and 20% to 30% in poorer villages. In Changzhi Special District, Shanxi, 80% of the masses had received patriotic education. In Huxi Special District, Pingyuan, the educated population accounted for more than 70%.

From the above situation, the popularization of anti-American aggression and patriotic education in various places is still very uneven. Especially in areas liberated later, there are still a large number of blank areas and blank spots. The masses' understanding of the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement is also insufficient. Taking Chang'an Street in Jinzhou City, where anti-American aggression propaganda and education work was done well, as an example, there are still two problems in the masses' minds: First, although the masses feel that American imperialism is hateful, they have not reached the degree of hatred as they did for the Japanese devils. What kind of country is the United States? Why is it hateful? Many people are still not clear about it. Second, the masses' understanding of the basic issues in anti-American aggression and patriotic education is still fragmented and unsystematic. Some people feel that "they understand in their hearts but can't express it in words"; many people still have some vague or even wrong understandings.

Various inspections and tests have revealed some problems in the past anti-American aggression propaganda and education work. For example, formalistic shortcomings were found in the anti-American aggression work in the fifth district of Beijing, Jinzhou City in Liaoxi, Luzhou City in Southern Sichuan, Feixi in Northern Anhui, and Jianyang in Fujian. In Qilin Village, Jianyang County, Fujian, a patriotic pact was signed at the May Day parade, but only nine cadres in the village knew the reason for signing the patriotic pact. Chang'an Street in Jinzhou City established a street anti-American aggression association in mid-April, but it had not played a role by the end of April. Taohua Township in Feixi, Northern Anhui, once organized 70 to 80 women to do propaganda work, some of whom did not know why to resist American aggression and aid Korea. Many propaganda personnel did not explain in light of the masses' thinking, and some spoke in a non-popular way, so that many masses were not interested in attending large meetings, and the effect was not good. Residents of Jiu Yi Street in the North Urban Area of Luzhou reflected: "The comrades talked about three shares, but I only understand one share," "They talk too much, too deeply, and I can't understand the terms, what 'bloody,' 'war mongers,' etc., I don't know what they mean." Residential Group No. 51, Datang Street, Yonghan District, Guangzhou City, held nine discussion meetings, and propaganda personnel visited each household six or seven times, but among the 71 people surveyed, 11 only knew the four words "resist American aggression and aid Korea," and two were completely unaware of it. Some cadres themselves do not have a clear understanding of the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement, so naturally they cannot conduct propaganda well to the masses, nor can they correctly lead the propaganda and education work. For example, some township cadres in Yumu District, Nanzhang County, Hubei, mistakenly believe that only participating in the Volunteer Army is the actual work of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea; the results of current affairs tests for 179 district-level cadres and above in Tongxian Special District, Hebei, showed that only three passed. Some cadres also do not have a sufficient understanding that resisting American aggression and aiding Korea is an important political task at present, a driving force for promoting all work, and must be closely integrated with various central tasks. For example, some township cadres in Taixian County, Northern Jiangsu, only mentioned the anti-American aggression and aid Korea in their work arrangements after May Day, without further specific arrangements. Some cadres in Jiaocheng, Shanxi, and Nanzhang, Hubei, and other places, put the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement in opposition to production, and abandoned the leadership of spring plowing production when promoting anti-American aggression and aid Korea. Some cadres have developed a slack mood towards the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement. For example, in Chuxian County, Northern Anhui, after May Day, six of the 14 county and district propaganda work cadres asked for leave to go home. When the Nongzhuang District in Taixian County, Northern Jiangsu, arranged work at an enlarged cadre meeting, it initially did not intend to discuss the anti-American aggression and aid Korea work, which was corrected after being pointed out by higher-level cadres.

After the inspection, most places have arranged the work of continuing to popularize and deepen the anti-American aggression and aid Korea movement according to the specific situation.

### 各地抽查抗美援朝宣传教育工作的情况

　　各地抽查抗美援朝宣传教育工作的情况
    五一以后，许多地区为着了解抗美援朝爱国教育的普及程度，进行了重点检查。例如福建建阳专区抗美援朝会和建阳县抗美援朝会，合组了三个检查小组，检查了三个工厂、城区工商界和城郊一个可以代表一般农村的村庄。广州市永汉区抗美援朝支会组织了干部、学生一百五十余人，抽查了区内宣传教育工作做得较好的、中等的与较差的居民小组各两个。中共湖北省委员会曾派干部调查了咸宁县第一区抗美援朝运动的三种类型的村庄。中共绥远省包头县委员会书记曾亲自抽查了两个村。太原、西安、上海等地某些工厂曾举行时事测验。湖北广济、应山等十一县、市，北京市第五区、辽西锦州市、江西南昌市、苏南无锡市、广西梧州市、川西泸州市、平原新乡县、山西临汾县、察哈尔天镇县、苏北清江市、泰县、海安县、皖北安庆市、肥西县、浙江杭县、台州、嘉定，川西温江等地都作了重点检查。此外，还有一些文化教育机构，如西安群众日报、北京市门头沟文化馆、西安市立第一中学等，在附近居民中作了调查。
    各地检查的方式，一般是召开小型群众座谈会和串门漫谈、个别访问等，有的出题举行笔试或口试。
    从各地检查结果中，可以看出上一阶段抗美援朝宣传教育工作的成绩，如辽西锦州市的长安街，被抽查的群众中百分之八十五对抗美援朝运动的几个基本问题有了初步认识，其中百分之五认识得相当透彻。广州市永汉区抽查三种类型六个居民小组的结果是：在被访问的四百五十五人中，知道为什么要抗美援朝的占百分之四十，只知道抗美援朝、保家卫国几个字而不懂其意义的占百分之三十六；还不知道抗美援朝的占百分之二十四。湖北省根据广济、应山等十一县市的重点抽查，较好的村庄、街道有百分之八十的人口受到了抗美援朝教育，一般的则在百分之五十到六十。苏南区城市中受到了教育的人口约占百分之七十到八十；小城镇在百分之六十左右；农村中一般的村庄约为百分之五十，较好的村庄到百分之七十至八十，较差的百分之二十至三十。山西长治专区则有百分之八十的群众受到了爱国教育。平原湖西专区受教育的人口占百分之七十以上。
    从上述情况来看，各地抗美援朝爱国教育的普及程度还是很不平衡的，特别是解放时间较晚的地区，还存在着大量的空白区和空白点。群众对抗美援朝运动的认识也还是不够的。以抗美援朝宣传教育工作做得较好的锦州市长安街为例，群众在思想上还存在着两个问题：第一，群众虽然觉得美帝国主义可恨，但还没有达到如同对日本鬼子的那种仇恨程度。美国到底是个什么样的国家？究竟为什么可恨？许多人还是搞不清楚。第二，群众对抗美援朝爱国教育中的几个基本问题的认识，还是零碎的，没有系统的。有的人觉得“心里明白，嘴里说不出”；许多人还有一些模糊的甚至错误的认识。
    各地检查、测验中发现了过去抗美援朝宣传教育工作中的一些问题。例如北京市第五区、辽西锦州市、川南泸州市、皖北肥西、福建建阳等地都发现过去抗美援朝工作中有形式主义的缺点。福建建阳县?林村在五一游行示威的大会上订立了爱国公约，但订爱国公约的道理，村里只有九个干部知道。锦州市长安街在四月中旬建立了街道抗美援朝会，但到四月下旬还没有起作用。皖北肥西桃花乡曾组织七、八十名妇女做宣传工作，其中有些人自己还不知道为什么要抗美援朝。许多地区的宣传人员没有针对群众的思想进行讲解，有的讲得不通俗，以致许多群众对开大会不感兴趣，效果也不好。泸州北城区旧一街的居民反应：“同志们讲的三股，我只懂一股”，“讲得太多，太深，名词懂不了，什么‘血腥’、‘战争贩子’等，不晓得是什么意思”。广州市永汉区大塘街第五十一号居民小组，曾开过九次座谈会，每户都由宣传人员访问过六、七次之多，但被抽查的七十一人中，还有十一人只知道“抗美援朝”四个字，有两人还完全不知道。有些干部自己对抗美援朝运动还没有明白的了解，这样自然不能很好地对群众宣传，也不能正确领导宣传教育工作。例如湖北南漳县浴沐区某些乡干部，误认为只有参加志愿军才是抗美援朝的实际工作；河北通县专区一百七十九名区级以上的干部举行时事测验的结果，及格的只有三人。部分干部对抗美援朝是当前重要的政治任务，是推动一切工作的动力，必须密切结合各项中心工作进行的认识也是很不够的，如苏北泰县有的乡干部在五一后布置工作时，只提到了抗美援朝一句话，没有进一步的具体布置。山西交城、湖北南漳等地某些干部把抗美援朝和生产对立起来，在宣传抗美援朝时就放弃了对春耕生产的领导。有的干部对抗美援朝运动产生了松懈情绪，如皖北滁县在五一以后，十四名县区宣传工作干部中有六人要请假回家。苏北泰县农庄区在扩大干部会议上布置工作时，起初不准备讨论抗美援朝工作，经上级干部指出后才加以纠正。
    各地经过检查之后，大多已根据具体情况，布置了今后继续普及与深入抗美援朝运动的工作。
