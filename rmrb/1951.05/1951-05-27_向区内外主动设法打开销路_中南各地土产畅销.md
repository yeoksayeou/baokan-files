Native products from Central and Southern China are selling well, after efforts made both inside and outside the region to actively seek sales channels.
The situation of sluggish sales of native products in the Central and Southern region since last November has been fundamentally changed. This is the result of local people's governments leading public and private businesses to hold native product conferences and exhibitions over the past three months, and sending commercial delegations to expand the sales channels of native products. Taking Hunan Province, famous for its rich native products, as an example, more than 80% of its native products now have sales channels. The state-owned trading company of Huanggang Special District in the Dabie Mountains of Hubei Province has not only sold most of the native products purchased this spring, but also cleared its inventory from last year.

According to incomplete statistics, since February this year, 22 special districts and 25 important cities and counties in the Central and Southern region have held native product investigation meetings, symposiums, or exhibitions. Through these meetings and exhibitions, various localities have carried out material exchange work within and outside the region by means of signing transaction contracts, agreements, and cash-for-goods transactions. The Hunan Province Native Products Exhibition, held in Changsha, also sent delegations with samples of native products to exhibitions in East China, North China, and Northwest China, enabling many of the province's native products to find new markets. The Henan Province Native Products Exchange Conference established four exchanges for native products, grain, groceries, and oils, with a transaction volume of more than 12 billion yuan during the conference period. The spring mule and horse fair, which had been interrupted for many years in various parts of Henan Province, has also been restored this spring. The 89 temple fairs restored in Nanyang Special District attracted more than 2 million people. At the Huaiyang County Mule and Horse Fair, the daily transaction volume of livestock reached 300 heads, breaking the previous record.

After the native product conferences and exhibitions held in various parts of the Central and Southern region, the cadres of state-owned trading companies have mostly begun to actively seek ways to open up sales channels for native products, changing the passive attitude of "waiting for customers to come to the door." For example, the state-owned trading companies in many special districts and counties in Henan Province have organized mobile teams or temple fair teams after the local native product conferences or exhibitions to purchase and sell native products in rural areas, mountainous areas, and lake areas. The state-owned trading companies in Jingzhou and Xiangyang special districts of Hubei Province have used more than 70% of their funds to operate native products. The state-owned trading companies and the industrial and commercial administration departments of some special districts and counties in Guangdong, Henan, and Hubei have sent commercial representatives to cities in East China, North China, Northwest China, and South China to establish trade relations, and some have brought samples for trial sales. The Guangxi Provincial Trading Company also listed the output, specifications, uses, and other information of 41 major native products in the province and sent them to 96 cities and counties across the country. The number of private merchants operating native products in various provinces and cities is also increasing. Merchants and peddlers in Wuhan, Changsha, Hengyang, Yuanling, Xiangfan, and other towns have organized joint operations to transport native products from the producing areas. The Native Products Joint Operation Cooperative organized by private merchants in Xiangfan City, Hubei Province, has established commercial relations with more than 20 towns inside and outside the province.

### 向区内外主动设法打开销路  中南各地土产畅销

　　向区内外主动设法打开销路
    中南各地土产畅销
    中南区去年十一月份以来土产滞销的局面已基本上改变过来。这是三个月来各地人民政府领导公私商业举行了土产会议、土产展览会，向区内外派出商业代表团努力扩大土产销路的结果。以土产丰富出名的湖南省来说，目前百分之八十以上的土产已有了销路。湖北省大别山区黄冈专区国营贸易公司不仅已销出今春收购土产的大部，连去年的存货也已卖完。
    据不完全统计，今年二月以来，中南区各省已有二十二个专区和二十五个重要市、县举行了土产调查会、座谈会或展览会。各地通过这些会议和土产展览会，以订立交易合同、协议书和现款现货的交易方法，展开了区内外的物资交流工作。湖南省土产展览会一面在长沙举行，一面派代表团带了土产样品到华东、华北、西北各地展览，使该省很多土产找到了新的市场。河南省土产展览交流大会的会场内设立了土产、粮食、杂货、油脂四个交易所，会期内交易额达一百二十多亿元。河南省各地中断多年的春季骡马百货大会，今春也纷纷恢复。南阳专区恢复的八十九个庙会，赶会的达二百万人以上。淮阳县骡马大会上，每天成交牲畜达三百头，打破了过去的纪录。
    中南区各地举行土产会议和土产展览会以后，国营贸易公司的干部大多已开始积极设法打开土产销路，改变了“等客上门”的消极态度。如河南好些专区和县的国营贸易公司都在当地土产会议或展览会后组织流动小组或赶庙会小组，到农村、山区、湖区采购和推销土产。湖北省荆州、襄阳等专区的国营贸易公司都以百分之七十以上的资金经营土产。广东、河南和湖北有些专区和县的国营贸易公司和人民政府工商行政部门都派出了商业代表到华东、华北、西北、华南各城市建立贸易关系，有的随带样品试销。广西省贸易公司还将该省四十一种主要土产的产量、规格、用途等列表寄发全国各地九十六个市、县。各省、市私商经营土产的也日益增多。武汉、长沙、衡阳、沅陵、襄樊等城镇的行商、摊贩都纷纷组织联营，到产地贩运土产。湖北襄樊市私商组织的土产联营社已和省内外二十多个城镇建立了商业关系。
