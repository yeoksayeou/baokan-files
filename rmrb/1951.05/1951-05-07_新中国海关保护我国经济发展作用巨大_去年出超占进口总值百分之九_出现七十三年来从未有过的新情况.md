　　The New China's Customs Plays a Huge Role in Protecting Our Economic Development
    Last Year's Exports Exceeded Imports by Nine Percent of the Total Import Value
    A New Situation Unseen in Seventy-Three Years
    The New China's Customs, after driving away imperialist forces, plays a significant role in protecting the development of the new Chinese economy. Last year, the surplus of exports over imports accounted for 9.34% of the total import value. This is a situation unseen in the seventy-three years since 1877 in our country.

    Regarding the supervision of foreign trade cargo, according to statistics from the General Administration of Customs, the goods entering and leaving the country under customs supervision last year accounted for 47.77% of the total import and export value for imports, and 52.23% for exports. The types of import and export commodities are also significantly different from the past. Before liberation, due to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, rational allocation and transportation were impossible, and our country consistently felt a shortage of grain. Therefore, imported rice, wheat, flour, etc., often ranked first in the total import value. For example, in 1932 it accounted for 20.64%, in 1933 for 19.75%, and in 1935 for 13.54%. Other consumer goods such as sugar, miscellaneous grains, and wool fabrics also accounted for a large proportion. Over the past year, the situation has greatly changed. Last year, more than 78% of imported goods were industrial raw materials and industrial equipment, entirely necessary for economic recovery. As for consumer goods, apart from those that are insufficiently produced domestically but are needed by the broad masses of people, the import of luxury goods has disappeared. The direction of foreign trade has also greatly changed in the past year: the trade value between the Soviet Union and our country has surpassed the United States and ranks first. Especially in exports, our country's exports to the Soviet Union have accounted for 26.58%, while the United States only accounts for 17.66%.

    In terms of collecting tariffs, as a result of the correct implementation of national policies and regulations by customs staff nationwide, the customs revenue in 1950 completed 171.48% of the predetermined task, ensuring the state's financial revenue.

    In terms of suppressing smuggling, customs offices in various regions have also made significant achievements in the past year. In old China, corruption was very serious in the customs service. Imperialist elements and bureaucrats and comprador also used their positions to engage in smuggling activities. The combination of corruption and smuggling severely exploited the blood and sweat of our country's working people. In response to these situations, customs offices in various regions, based on the principle of combining education and punishment, launched an anti-corruption movement while strictly suppressing smuggling. After a year of efforts, the large-scale smuggling phenomena by imperialists, warlords, bureaucrats, and bullies in the old customs era have been basically eliminated.

　　新中国海关保护我国经济发展作用巨大
    去年出超占进口总值百分之九
    出现七十三年来从未有过的新情况
    赶走了帝国主义势力后的新中国海关，在保护新中国经济的发展上起着重大的作用。去年对外贸易出超占进口总值百分之九点三四。这是我国自一八七七年以来的七十三年中从来没有的情况。
    在监管对外贸易货运方面，根据海关总署的统计，去年一年在海关监管下进出国境的货物，进口占进出口总值百分之四十七点七七，出口占进出口总值百分之五十二点二三。进出口商品的种类，和过去也有了显著的不同。解放以前，由于国民党的反动统治，不能合理调运，我国历年均感粮食不足。因此进口的米、麦、面粉等，常占进口总额的第一位。例如一九三二年占百分之二十点六四，一九三三年占百分之十九点七五，一九三五年占百分之十三点五四。其他消费品如糖、杂粮、呢绒等也都占很大的比重。一年多以来，情况已大不相同。去年进口货中，百分之七十八以上都是工业原料和工业器材，完全是恢复经济所必需的物品。至于消费物资，除掉国内生产不足而为广大人民所需要的以外，奢侈品的进口已告绝迹。对外贸易的方向一年来也有了很大的改变：苏联与我国贸易值的比重已超越美国而占第一位，特别在出口方面，我国对苏联输出已占百分之二十六点五八，美国只占百分之十七点六六。
    在征收关税方面，全国海关工作人员正确执行国家政策法令的结果，一九五○年关税收入完成了预定任务的百分之一百七十一点四八，保证了国家财政的收入。
    在查禁走私方面，各地海关一年来也有显著的成绩。旧中国的海关，贪污风气很严重。帝国主义分子和官僚、买办又利用职权进行走私活动。贪污与走私相结合，重重榨取了我国劳动人民的血汗。各地海关针对这些情况，本着教育与处分相结合的方针，展开了反贪污运动，同时严格查禁走私。经过一年来的努力，旧海关时代帝国主义、军阀、官僚、恶霸大规模走私现象已基本消灭。
