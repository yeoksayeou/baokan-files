　　Instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    on the Work of Summer Grain Collection in 1951

    I. The proportion of summer and autumn grain collection quotas for this year shall be determined by the people's governments of each province (city) based on the actual proportion of summer and autumn yields to the annual yield in their respective regions, and submitted to the people's government (military and political committee) of the greater administrative region for approval and implementation. Provinces and cities directly under the central government shall report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government for approval and implementation. Regions with particularly small summer harvests may collect all grain in the autumn without conducting a summer collection. In areas where land reform was carried out last year and this spring, if disputes arise due to the transfer of land with crops, the provincial (municipal) people's government shall formulate specific measures based on the actual situation and submit them to the people's government (military and political committee) of the greater administrative region for approval.

    II. To ensure the needs of the state and regulate the market, it is hoped that all regions will collect as much wheat as possible. Regions that cannot collect wheat may handle it flexibly by collecting appropriate amounts of coarse grains (barley, beans), currency, and cash crops. The types, quantities, and price ratios of cash crops to be collected shall be determined by the people's governments of the greater administrative regions (military and political committees) or the people's governments of the provinces and cities directly under the central government, and submitted to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government for approval and implementation. Cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas may use cotton to offset their summer grain quota, and the price ratio shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Instructions on Guaranteeing the Cotton-Grain Price Ratio" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on March 7, 1951. Regions with abundant summer specialties (such as tea, silk, fruits, etc.) may collect a portion of currency as appropriate. The deadline for collecting currency should not be too short, and extensive publicity should be conducted among farmers in advance to allow them to prepare.

    III. In order to successfully complete the summer collection work and prepare for the autumn collection work, it is hoped that the heads of governments at all levels will take charge, personally take action, strengthen the leadership of the summer collection, organize a certain amount of manpower, go to the countryside to publicize the policy of our people's government on grain collection, and pay attention to timely improvement of the collection business, and trial implementation of the accounting work of collection, delivery and storage, in order to achieve timely reporting and accurate figures. In the newly liberated areas where land reform has been completed, it is also necessary to conduct land surveys and determine production after the summer harvest in order to further implement the policy of reasonable burden.

    关于一九五一年夏季征收公粮工作的指示
    一、今年夏、秋两季征收公粮数额比例，由各省（市）人民政府根据各该地区夏、秋产量各占全年产量的实际比例拟定，报大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）批准执行。中央直属省、市报中央财政部批准执行。夏收特别少的地区，可一律于秋季一次征收，不进行夏征。去年和今春进行土地改革的地区，如有因土地带苗转移而引起负担纠纷时，由省（市）人民政府根据实际情况规定具体办法，报请大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）批准执行之。
    二、为保证国家需要，调剂市场，望各地尽可能地多征小麦。不能征收小麦的地区，得变通办理  ，征收适当数量的杂粮（大麦、豆类）货币和经济作物。征收经济作物的种类、数量和比价等事项，由各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）或各中央直属省（市）人民政府拟定，报中央财政部批准执行。产棉区存棉户得以棉花抵缴夏季公粮，其比价可照政务院财政经济委员会一九五一年三月七日发布的《关于保证棉粮比价的指示》的规定办理。夏季特产（如茶叶、蚕丝、果木等）多的地区，得酌征一部分货币。征收货币的期限不可过短，并应事先向农民做广泛宣传，以便预为准备。
    三、为了顺利完成夏征工作，并为秋征工作准备条件，望各级人民政府首长负责，亲自动手，加强夏征的领导，组织一定力量，下乡宣传我人民政府的征收公粮的政策，并注意及时改进征收业务，试办征收解库的会计工作，以期做到结报及时，数字准确。已经完成土地改革的新区，并须在夏收后，进行查田定产，以便进一步贯彻合理负担的政策。
                            总理  周恩来
                                    一九五一年五月二十五日
