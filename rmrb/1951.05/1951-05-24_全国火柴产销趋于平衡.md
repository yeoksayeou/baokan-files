Title: National Match Production and Sales Tend Towards Equilibrium

National match production and sales have achieved preliminary equilibrium after repeated adjustments in the match industry. Before June 1950, the relationship between production and sales in the match industry was very unbalanced, causing a large backlog of finished matches, and even some factories were forced to shut down because they could not sell their products. For example, in Tianjin, only six of the eighteen match factories could maintain production. From January to March of last year, the inventory backlog reached more than 12,000 cases. In Beijing, six out of fourteen factories were shut down in March 1950. According to the statistics of the National Match Conference in June 1950, the monthly production capacity of the national match industry, based on existing production equipment, was two-thirds more than needed; based on the then current output, it was one-third more than needed. In order to change this situation, the Match Conference re-estimated the actual demand for matches in various parts of the country and decided on the match production plan for the second half of 1950. However, after the clearance of match inventories in various parts of the country in October, due to the bumper harvests of grain and cotton last autumn, the purchasing power of rural areas generally increased, and the demand for matches increased unabated, resulting in a situation where the production of matches could not meet demand. For example, in September and October, the Danhua Match Factory in Tianjin and the Hengtai Match Factory in Jinan experienced situations where farmers waited at the factory to buy matches because the output was insufficient. After adjustments by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, the planned national output was used as the basis, and it was adjusted to 105 percent in August and further adjusted to 125 percent in October, so that production and sales were largely balanced. In terms of reducing costs and product specifications, various regions have also made progress to varying degrees. For example, the Lanzhou Tongsheng Match Factory's cost per case was 820,000 yuan in May, and it was reduced to 660,000 yuan in October, with a profit of 70,000 yuan per case. At the same time, the country has basically stopped manufacturing yellow phosphorus matches and switched to phosphorus sulfide matches. And places that used to manufacture red-head phosphorus sulfide matches are also renovating to produce white-head matches in the spirit of streamlining and saving. This has no impact on sales, but it reduces costs. Since the implementation of the match product inspection and pricing method, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Jiangxi, Guangxi and other places have successively established match product inspection and pricing committees or inspection teams, which have conducted one to three in-depth inspections of products. This has played a good role in improving the quality of matches, unifying specifications, reducing costs and controlling prices. For example, in May and June of last year, about one-third of each box of matches produced by the state-owned Kaifeng Match Factory in Henan could not be lit, but now all of them can be lit, and the problems of head detachment and explosion have been overcome. In the past, the average number of broken matches in the privately-owned Tiancheng Match Factory in Beijing accounted for 30 percent of the total number of matches in the whole box. After inspection, it has been improved, and the number of broken matches has been significantly reduced. In the past, there were more than a dozen packaging specifications, such as boxes, barrels, tubes, bamboo hats, baskets, mats, cans, envelopes, and packages, and the names were extremely inconsistent, making transactions and transportation very inconvenient. Since January 1951, a new packaging specification with "pieces" (1,000 small boxes per piece) as the basic unit and "double pieces" (2,000 boxes) and "large pieces" (10,000 boxes) as auxiliary units has been implemented, and packaging specifications have gradually become unified.

Since the Match Conference determined the production plan last June, the relevant leading organs have lacked experience and only saw the temporary difficulties in sales in the first half of 1950. They underestimated the increase in rural purchasing power after the autumn harvest, and the production control figures were also too tight, so that various regions could not adjust production flexibly according to the actual situation. Later, although the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government made two adjustments, some areas still experienced a disconnect between supply and demand, and some match industry members in some areas did not have a clear understanding of the production plan and mistakenly emphasized taking care of the local match industry, adopting a "rejection" attitude towards the sales of matches from other regions, instead of trying to improve quality and reduce costs. At the same time, in September and October of last year, individual merchants in some areas took advantage of the temporary reduction in production in the match industry and hoarded goods and speculated on prices. The direction of the match industry's efforts in the future should be to steadily develop production from balancing supply and sales. On the one hand, it needs to be highly flexible and adaptable to ensure an adequate supply to rural needs, but on the other hand, it still needs to avoid blind development and regional competitive sales in order to strengthen the planned nature of national match industry production.

### 全国火柴产销趋于平衡

　　全国火柴产销趋于平衡
    全国火柴工业经一再调整后，初步做到了产销平衡。在一九五○年六月以前，火柴工业的产销关系是很不平衡的，引起火柴成品的大批积压，甚而有的工厂因成品推销不出去而停工。如天津市十八家火柴厂，能维持生产者仅六家；去年一至三月，存货积压达一万二千箱以上。北京市一九五○年三月份十四个厂中有六个厂停工。据一九五○年六月全国火柴会议时统计：全国火柴工业每月生产以现有生产设备而论，过剩三分之二，以当时产量论，过剩三分之一。火柴会议为了改变这种情况，重新估计了全国各地火柴的实际需要量，决定了一九五○年下半年的火柴生产计划。但十月份全国各地火柴存货出清后，由于去秋粮棉丰收，农村购买力普遍提高，火柴的需要量有增无已，出现了火柴生产供不应求的现象。如在九、十月份天津市丹华火柴厂、济南市恒泰火柴厂因产量不够供应，曾发生农民坐厂待购情况。经中央人民政府轻工业部调整后，以全国原计划产量为基础，八月份调整至百分之一百零五，十月份再调整至百分之一百二十五，使产销大体上趋于平衡。在降低成本和产品规格方面，各地也都有着不同程度的进步。如兰州市同生火柴厂，每箱成本五月份为八十二万元，十月份降低到六十六万元，每箱可盈利七万元。同时全国基本上已停止制造黄磷火柴，改制硫化磷火柴。而过去制造红头硫化磷火柴的地方，也本着精简节约的精神，改造白头火柴。这样对销路并无影响，但是降低了成本。自实行火柴成品检验议价办法后，北京、上海、天津、重庆、广州、江西、广西等地均先后成立了火柴成品检验议价委员会或检验小组，对产品进行了一至三次的深入检查，这对火柴品质的提高，规格的统一，成本的降低及价格的掌握起了良好的作用。如河南公营开封火柴厂在去年五、六月份每盒火柴几有三分之一不能发火，现在已全部能发火，并克服了脱头与爆炸现象。北京市私营天成火柴厂，过去残柴平均占全盒火柴总数的百分之三十，经检验后，已加改进，残柴显著减少。过去的包装规格有箱、桶、筒、笠、篓、席、听、封、包等十数种，名称极不一致，交易运输都很不便。自一九五一年一月起实行以“件”（每件一千小盒）为基本单位，“双件”（两千盒）、“大件”（一万盒）为辅助单位的新包装规格后，包装规格逐渐达到统一。
    自去年六月火柴会议确定计划生产后，由于有关领导机关缺乏经验，只看到一九五○年上半年销路暂时困难，对秋收后农村购买力的提高估计不足，对于生产控制数字亦掌握过紧，致各地不能依据实际情况机动的调整产量。以后中央人民政府轻工业部虽曾调整两次，但若干地区仍发生供求脱节现象，若干地区火柴同业对生产计划认识不清，错误地强调了照顾本地火柴工业，对外区火柴销售采取了“排斥”的态度，而不设法对提高品质、降低成本方面努力。同时去年九、十月间，个别地区的商人，趁着火柴业暂时减缩生产，曾发生囤积不售，投机抬价的情况。今后火柴工业努力的方向，应该是从平衡供销来稳步发展生产。一方面需要富于机动性、灵活性，以保证充分供应农村需要，但另一方面仍需避免盲目发展和地区性的竞销，以加强全国火柴工业生产的计划性。
