　　I Hate Imperialism's Looting of Our Country's Precious Cultural Relics Editor Comrade:
    I read Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's "The Significance of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Exhibition" published in the 96th issue of "People's Literature and Art" on April 15th with extreme excitement, reading it several times.

    Our ancestors, who loved life, loved art, and worked diligently, used their rich wisdom to create a great history and left us such a glorious and splendid artistic heritage as the Dunhuang cultural relics. When we see these great and precious heritages, a feeling of love for the motherland burns in our hearts.

    I hate those reactionary rulers who plundered the crystallization of the laboring people's hard work with extreme greed and obscured the truth of history by various means. From the facts revealed in the article "The Significance of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Exhibition," we have learned about the shameless and evil deeds of those greedy and insatiable imperialist robbers and their running dogs. They used their filthy blood-stained hands to rob countless precious cultural relics from our motherland. This act of robbery is intolerable to every patriotic people. We must recover this huge debt!

### 我痛恨帝国主义劫夺我国珍贵文物

　　我痛恨帝国主义劫夺我国珍贵文物编辑同志：
    四月十五日《人民文艺》第九十六期上登载了一篇郑振铎先生的《敦煌文物展览的意义》，我以极度紧张的心情把它读了好几遍。
    我们的热爱生活、热爱艺术、辛勤劳动的祖先，用丰富的智慧，创造了伟大的历史，给我们遗留下了象敦煌文物这样光辉灿烂的艺术遗产。我们看到这些伟大的宝贵遗产，心里便燃烧起热爱祖国的情感。
    我痛恨那些反动统治者们，他们以极度的贪欲掠夺劳动人民心血的结晶，用种种方法蒙蔽历史的真相。从《敦煌文物展览的意义》一文里所揭露的事实真相，使我们知道了那些贪婪无厌的帝国主义的强盗及其走狗们，所作的无耻罪恶的勾当。他们用他们肮脏透顶的血手，劫夺去了我们祖国无数珍贵文物，这种强盗的抢掠行为，是我们每个热爱祖国的人民所不能容忍的，我们一定要讨回这笔巨债！
        东北人民政府财政部  李学诗
