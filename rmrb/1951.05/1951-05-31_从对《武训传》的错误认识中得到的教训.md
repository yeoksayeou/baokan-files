Lessons Learned from the Erroneous Understanding of "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Wang Shigu

A Communist Party member engaged in propaganda work should pay close attention to combating erroneous ideas around him and upholding the truth. However, after watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which promoted reactionary ideas, I thought: this film is basically good, the only shortcoming is that the director treated Wu Xun as a clown, but the problem is not big. It was not until the People's Daily published an editorial criticizing the film "The Life of Wu Xun" that I was shocked to realize that the film "The Life of Wu Xun" was fundamentally wrong.

So why didn't I see this error in principle and agree to the praise of the film "The Life of Wu Xun"? The main reason is that I did not master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism. Although I had learned a little bit of historical materialism in the past, it was only some dogma that could not be combined with practice. At the same time, I felt that I had not made any errors of principle in my work, so I developed complacency and could not humbly study the problem. From this criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," I realized that a Communist Party member, especially a propaganda worker, who does not master the weapon of Marxism-Leninism will lose his way and make mistakes in practical work. Now, in addition to participating in the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and learning in this ideological struggle, I am determined to study political theory well in the future and truly learn to use the Marxist-Leninist point of view and method to analyze problems.

　　从对《武训传》的错误认识中得到的教训
    王士谷
    一个担任宣传工作的共产党员，是应当十分注意与周围的错误思想进行斗争，维护真理。但是当我看了宣传反动思想的《武训传》电影以后，却认为：这部片子基本上是好的，缺点只是导演把武训处理成一个小丑，但问题不大。直到人民日报发表了批判《武训传》电影的社论后，才使我大吃一惊，原来《武训传》电影是根本错误的。
    那末我为什么没有看出这个原则性的错误，而且同意对《武训传》电影的表扬呢？最主要的原因，是我没有掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器。虽然我过去也学过一点点历史唯物论，但只是一些教条，不能与实际结合。同时自己觉得在工作中并未犯过什么原则性的错误，因而产生了自满情绪，不能虚心研究问题。从这次对《武训传》电影的批判中，使我认识了：一个共产党员，特别是一个宣传工作者，不能掌握马克思列宁主义武器，是会在实际工作中迷失方向、犯错误的。现在我除了要参加关于《武训传》电影的批判，在这一思想斗争中学习外，下决心今后要好好学习政治理论，真正学会运用马克思列宁主义的观点，方法去分析问题。
