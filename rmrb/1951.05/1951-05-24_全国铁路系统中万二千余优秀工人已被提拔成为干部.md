　　More than 12,000 Outstanding Workers in the National Railway System Have Been Promoted to Cadres

　　Since the liberation of the entire country, more than 12,400 outstanding workers in the national railway system have been promoted to cadres in railway trade unions and enterprise management departments at all levels. Many of them have even taken on important leadership roles. For example, among the 8,007 cadres promoted successively in the Northeast Railway System, one-third hold positions such as chairman of trade unions and section chief, section head, and stationmaster of railway administrations. Wang Baorang and Hao Zuoxin, veteran workers of the Jilin Railway Administration, have been promoted to deputy director of the Vehicle Department and deputy director of the Locomotive Department, respectively. Li Yong, the nationally renowned model locomotive "Mao Zedong" driver, has been elected vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union.

　　Many of these cadres promoted from the ranks of workers are veteran workers who have worked on the railway for decades. They all have rich work experience and are therefore generally competent. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, their talents were always buried, but now they have the opportunity to be fully utilized. For example, after Wang Baorang was promoted to deputy director, he was also elected as a model cadre of the entire administration.

　　After a large number of outstanding workers were promoted to cadres managing state-owned enterprises, the general worker masses further realized the status of the working class as masters of the country, greatly strengthened their sense of responsibility in their work, and improved work efficiency.

　　全国铁路系统中万二千余优秀工人已被提拔成为干部
    自全国解放迄今，全国铁路系统中已有一万二千四百余位优秀工人，被提拔为各级铁路工会和企业管理部门的干部。其中许多人且已担负了重要的领导工作。例如东北区铁路系统先后提拔起来的八千零七个干部中，就有三分之一担负着工会主席及铁路管理局的科长、段长、站长等职务。吉林铁路管理局老工人王宝让和郝作新并分别被提拔为该局车辆处副处长和机务处副处长。全国闻名的模范机车“毛泽东号”司机长李永，更被选任为中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席。
    这些从工人中提拔起来的干部，有很多是在铁路上工作了几十年的老工人。他们都有丰富的工作经验，因而一般地都很称职。过去在日伪、国民党反动统治下，他们的才能始终被埋没，现在才得到了充分发挥的机会。例如王宝让被提拔为副处长后，并当选为全局的模范干部。
    大批优秀工人被提拔为管理国家企业的干部后，一般工人群众也从而进一步体会到工人阶级的国家主人翁地位，大大加强了工作责任心，提高了工作效率。
