　　Some Questions on Introducing Soviet Children's Literature
    He Yi
    At present, children's books in China are still quite scarce, both in terms of quality and quantity. In order to satisfy the thirst for knowledge of the vast number of child readers, it is beneficial to introduce excellent Soviet children's books. A large number of translated and published Soviet children's books have already been introduced, providing our children with new lives, new realms, and new knowledge, and providing our writers and education cadres with the opportunity to learn how to educate the new generation, which has played a certain positive role.
    First of all, it is essential to recognize that the main purpose of introducing Soviet children's literature is to help our children understand and learn about the Soviet Union and to learn about the lives and studies of Soviet children. The introduction of Soviet children's literature can only be expected to play a supporting and supplementary role in our entire children's book publishing work, and it cannot be placed in the main position. Because only things written by our own Chinese authors can more closely and effectively cooperate with the actual situation of our children. Soviet children's books are written by authors according to the actual needs of Soviet children, not for Chinese children; therefore, the educational role it plays for Chinese readers cannot be compared with the educational role it plays for Soviet readers, nor can it be compared with the educational role that our own children's books play in children.
    However, in the current publishing work of children's books in China, the focus is clearly on the introduction of Soviet children's books, and the number of original works is pitifully small. For example, the East China General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has published a total of sixteen children's literature books, of which fourteen are translated; in the "New China Juvenile Library" of Sanlian Bookstore, only four of the twenty-six books published are original. According to the "Catalogue of Books for Young People and Children" published by Shanghai New Children's Bookstore in March of this year, 270 of the 450 literature books are translated, accounting for 60% of the total. The proportion of translated works is too high, and it is impossible not to regard it as a not-so-good trend. A careful examination of these Soviet children's book translations currently published can reveal several quite serious problems.
    First, in the introduction of Soviet children's literature, there is a phenomenon of scrambling for translation and publication, resulting in many repetitions. For example, there are five translations of Pantaleev's *The Great Wash*; four of Mikhalkov's *Visiting the Lenin Museum*; and three each of Nosov's *Storming the Winter Palace* and Tolstoy's *The Blue Carpet*. There are many more with two translations. There are even more repetitions of various short fairy tales, which are included in different collections with different book titles.
    Second, Soviet children's books are published indiscriminately. We know that the Soviet Union is an advanced socialist country, and there are some differences between the political, economic, and cultural lives of the Soviet people and ours; these differences also exist between Soviet children and our children. Therefore, some books are very suitable for Soviet children, but not necessarily for Chinese children. Secondly, Soviet children's books also inevitably have individual errors and shortcomings, which should be noted when selecting and translating. For example, at the thirteenth plenary meeting of the Board of Directors of the Soviet Writers' Association at the end of January last year, Nieqieyev pointed out many facts of using folk materials uncritically in fairy tales. Simonov sharply criticized Flaierman's novel *The Long Voyage* in his report "On the Current Situation of Children's Literature and Several Issues in Its Development," believing that it was "a typical example of the writer's erroneous view on what the character of the new society's people is and how it should be cultivated." He also criticized Helaskina's *Certificate of Maturity*, Simukov's *Sparrow Mountain*, and Lyubimova's *They Quarreled*, believing that these writers "are taking the stale road, deviating from the truth of life, and going to the side away from the reality of things in Soviet society."
    Therefore, before introducing Soviet children's books, we should first consider: What help and effect will introducing this or that Soviet children's book have on our children? Does it meet the needs of our children in today's situation? Without starting from the needs of our children's education and the actual situation of our children, and introducing Soviet children's books indiscriminately, its educational role and effect are limited. Of course, this is by no means to say that Soviet children's books should not be translated; on the contrary, we should affirm that the vast majority of Soviet children's books are excellent, mature, and helpful to children. We only advocate that we should choose carefully, so that it will be more helpful to our children.
    Third, there are still some frivolous and irresponsible attitudes in the translation of children's books. Of course, there are translators who do their work very seriously, but some comrades are not serious enough. I don't understand Russian, but I often hear friends who understand Russian say that many translations of Soviet children's books have serious errors. In particular, some comrades who are just beginning to learn Russian probably translated some children's books for the sake of practicing translation. Because their Russian proficiency is poor, some mistakes are inevitable. Sometimes, some translators are not very fluent in Chinese either, and the sentences are obscure and difficult, and often fail to express the meaning. Such writing is unbearable even for adults, how can it be read by our young readers? Of course, I don't mean to ask them not to translate, on the contrary, I hope they can translate more; but before they send out their translations, it is best to proofread them carefully, or ask friends who are better at Russian to help correct them. In particular, the writing must be fluent and clear, and able to adapt to the understanding of children. Because there is such a situation now: some publishing institutions are too trusting of the translator's ability and do not ask experts who are proficient in Russian to proofread, so they rashly print them, resulting in some very regrettable consequences.
    We believe that those engaged in the translation of children's books should be responsible to the original author on the one hand, and to the vast number of child readers on the other. We must think about what losses any negligence and errors in the work will cause to children! Translators should correct their translation attitude and be as serious and rigorous as if they are engaged in creation themselves.
    Finally, I would like to raise another point.
    Since we are not introducing for the sake of introducing, but introducing for the needs of our children, then can we consider rewriting it under the condition of not violating the spirit of the original book? I think rewriting is beneficial. First, after rewriting, the writing grammar can be more suitable for our children to read, and the content and spirit of the original can be more easily accepted by children; second, some of the things in some books that are not suitable for our children to read in today's situation can be appropriately filtered; third, some originals are longer, and after rewriting, they can be streamlined to better adapt to the reading ability and economic conditions of our children today. I have seen some Soviet children's books that are also rewritten based on foreign works, such as *The Wizard of Oz*, *The Golden Key* (ie, Collodi's *The Adventures of Pinocchio*), *The Little Hero of France* (ie, Hugo's *Les Misérables*)… and so on. This is well worth learning from.
    In order to do a good job in children's books, in general, it is necessary to require the existing authors of children's books to improve politically and to encourage and cultivate new authors of children's books to create a large number of children's books with excellent quality. In the translation work, we should overcome the shortcomings of repeated grabbing and translation, and we can organize the translators of children's books to carry out close division of labor and exchange experiences. Shanghai has established an organization of children's book translation team, and this experience can be emulated and promoted in various places (especially Northeast and Beijing).
    Editor's note: Our children's books should take on the responsibility of "educating new people and creating new people," should be closely linked to our new reality, and should be properly absorbed by our new generation, which will help cultivate the character of new children. Therefore, in the publishing work of children's books, we should focus on the creation of our children's books. Our children's book writers should study more about the work of children and teenagers in China and the Soviet Union, as well as the experience of Soviet children's book creation, to strengthen their work. They should choose interesting characters and interesting things to write interesting books, and they should be books with a high degree of political and ideological content. We should also select Soviet children's books with principles and focus to introduce them. The rewriting method provided by Comrade He Yi in this article is worth doing. As for translation, Mu Mutian's article "On the Translation of Soviet Children's Literature" in the fifth issue of the second volume of *Translation Bulletin* pointed out: 1. "The translations of Soviet children's books that have been published in the past should be revised in a planned way to make them the finalized version"; 2. "It is hoped that comrades who translate Soviet children's literature can spend more time studying the language of Chinese children's literature." These two points should also be taken seriously.

　　关于介绍苏联儿童读物的一些问题
    贺宜
    目前国内儿童读物，无论在质量上、数量上都还相当贫乏。为了满足广大儿童读者的求知欲，把苏联优秀的儿童读物介绍过来，是有益的。现在已有大量翻译出版的苏联儿童读物，介绍新的生活、新的境界、新的知识给我们的儿童，并供我们的作家、教育干部学习如何教育新生一代，起了一定的好作用。
    首先，有一点必须认清，那就是介绍苏联儿童读物的目的，主要为了帮助我国的儿童认识并学习苏联，了解苏联儿童的生活及学习情况。苏联儿童读物的介绍，在我们整个儿童读物的出版工作上，只能要求它起一些配合和补充的作用，可不能放在主要的地位。因为只有我们中国作者自己编写的东西，才能更密切有效地配合我国儿童的实际情况。苏联的儿童读物，是作者们根据苏联儿童的实际需要编写的，不是为我国的儿童编写的；因此，它对中国读者所起的教育作用，是不能与它对苏联读者所起的教育作用相比的，也不能与我们自己的儿童读物在儿童中所起的教育作用相比的。
    然而，在目前我国儿童读物的出版工作中，重点显然是放在苏联儿童读物的介绍上，创作的作品少得可怜。例如，新华书店华东总分店共出了十六本儿童文学读物，其中十四本是翻译的；三联书店的“新中国少年文库”，已出版的二十六本书中只有四本是创作。根据上海新儿童书店本年三月出版的《少年儿童读物书目》，四五○种文学书籍中有二七○种是翻译的，占总数的百分之六十。翻译作品的比重占得太高，已经不能不认为是一个不太好的倾向，而把目前出版的这些苏联儿童读物译本认真检查一下，更可以发现几个相当严重的问题。
    第一，在苏联儿童读物的介绍工作中，有着争抢翻译与出版的现象，以至有了很多的重复。如班台莱耶夫的《大洗大刷》有五种译本；米海尔柯夫的《参观列宁博物馆》有四种；诺索夫的《攻打冬宫》，托尔斯泰的《蓝色地毯》有三种。两种译本的更是多不胜举。还有各种短篇的童话故事，收在不同的集子里，书名不一，重复更多。
    第二，对苏联儿童读物无选择地出版。我们知道：苏联是一个社会主义的先进国家，苏联人民的政治、经济、文化的生活，和我们的之间，是存在着若干距离的；这些距离也存在于苏联儿童与我们的儿童之间。因此有些读物，对于苏联儿童很适合，可是对于中国的儿童，却不一定如此。其次，苏联的儿童读物，也还不可避免有着个别的错误和缺点，在选译时应当注意。例如去年一月底，苏联作家协会理事会第十三次全体会议在讨论儿童文学问题时，就有涅却也夫指出了许多毫无批判地在童话中使用民俗材料的事实。西蒙诺夫在“论儿童文学的当前情况及其发展的几个问题”的报告中间，尖锐地批评了弗拉耶尔曼的小说《远航》，认为是“作家对于什么是新社会的人的性格，和应当怎样养成它这一问题上的错误观点的典型”。他也批评了海拉斯金娜的《成年证明书》，西穆可夫的《雀山》，和柳比莫娃的《他们吵架了》，认为这些作家“有走着陈腐的道路，离开了生活的真实，离开了苏维埃社会中事物的现实情况而走到旁边去”。
    所以，把苏联儿童读物介绍过来之前，我们应该首先这样考虑：介绍这本或那本苏联儿童读物，将对我国儿童有些什么帮助，起些什么作用？是不是符合在今天情况下的我国儿童的需要？不从我们教育儿童的需要及目前我国儿童的实际情况出发，而不加选择地介绍苏联儿童读物，其教育作用与效果是有限的。当然，这绝不是说苏联儿童读物不应该译；相反，我们应肯定苏联的儿童读物绝大多数是优秀的，成熟的，对儿童是有帮助的。我们只是主张应该审慎选择，这样才对我们的儿童更有帮助。
    第三，在儿童读物的翻译工作上还表现着一些轻率和不负责任的态度。固然有把工作做得很认真的翻译工作者，但也有一些同志却是不够郑重的。我不懂俄文，但常听到一些懂俄文的朋友谈起，不少的苏联儿童读物译本，是有着严重错误的。特别是一些初学俄文的同志，大概是为了练习翻译吧，译了些儿童读物。由于他们的俄文程度较差，难免发生了一些错误。有时，有些译者连中文也不甚通顺，文句晦涩艰深，常常辞不达意。这样的译笔，就是成人也看不下去，如何能给我们的小读者阅读呢？当然，我的意思不是请他们不要翻译，相反，是希望他们能多译一些；只是，在他们把译稿送出以前，最好能好好校勘一下，或者请俄文较好的朋友帮忙校正。尤其是文笔，必须通顺明白，而且能够适应儿童的理解力。因为现在有这样一种情况：有些出版机构，过于信任了译者的能力，不请精通俄文的专家校阅，于是就贸然付印，结果造成了一些很可惋惜的后果。
    我们认为从事儿童读物翻译工作，一方面应该对原作者负责，一方面又须对广大的儿童读者负责。必须想到：工作上的任何疏忽和错误，对儿童将会造成一些什么损失！翻译工作者应该端正翻译态度，如同自己在从事创作一样地认真严肃。
    最后，我提出另一点意见。
    既然我们不是为介绍而介绍，是为了我国儿童的需要而介绍，那么，我们是不是可以考虑：在不违反原书精神的条件之下加以改写呢？我想改写是有好处的。第一，改写之后，行文语法可更适合我国儿童阅读，原著的内容和精神可以更易为儿童所接受；第二、有些读物中部分存在着不适于今天情况下我国儿童阅读的东西，可以把它适当地加以清滤；第三，有些原著篇幅较长，改写之后可以精简些，更适应今天我国的儿童的阅读能力和经济条件。我看到苏联儿童读物中有些也是根据外国作品改写的，例如《绿野仙踪》、《金钥匙》（即柯罗狄的《木偶奇遇记》）、《法兰西小英雄》（即雨果的《悲惨世界》）……等都是。这很值得我们学习。
    为了把儿童读物的工作作好，总的说来，是应该要求现有的儿童读物的作者从政治上提高一步，并鼓励和培养新的儿童读物的作者，以创作有优良品质的大量儿童读物。在翻译工作上，应克服重复抢译的缺点，可以把儿童读物的翻译工作者组织起来，进行严密分工，交流经验。上海已经成立了一个儿童读物翻译小组的组织，这个经验，各地（特别是东北和北京）都可仿效和发扬。
    编者按：我国的儿童读物应该负起“教育新人，创造新人”的责任，应该与我国的新现实密切相连，应该为我们的新生一代所能恰当地吸收，有助于新儿童性格的培养。因此，在儿童读物的出版工作中，我们应该把重点放在我国儿童读物的创作上。我国的儿童读物作家应该更多地研究我国和苏联的少年儿童工作以及苏联少年儿童读物创作的经验来加强自己的工作，应该选择有兴趣的人物和有兴趣的事来写出有兴趣的书，并且是有高度政治性和思想性的书。也应该有原则、有重点地选择苏联的儿童读物，加以介绍。贺宜同志此文提供的改写办法，是值得去做的。就翻译来说，《翻译通报》二卷五期穆木天《关于苏联儿童文学的翻译》一文指出：一、“对于过去出版的苏联儿童读物的译本，应当有计划地去校订，使之成为定本”；二、“希望翻译苏联儿童文学的同志们，能拿出多的时间来，研究中国儿童文学语言”。这两点也应该引起重视。
