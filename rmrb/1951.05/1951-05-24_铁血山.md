　　Iron Blood Mountain
    Yue Zhongyi, Combat Hero, Company Commander of a Certain Unit of the Volunteer Army

    I am a company commander of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. On the night of November 25th last year, our army launched the Second Campaign. Our company set out from Rise-dong and advanced at a rapid march. When we reached Taechon County, the vanguard had already inserted behind enemy lines from the flank. We engaged with a regiment of the Li Seung-man bandit army's so-called "elite 1st Division." At the time, the enemy couldn't figure out our situation and kept retreating. We pressed on, hitting and chasing the enemy hard. After dawn, the enemy realized we were small in number and immediately scattered to surround us. Then they brought in twelve planes, wanting to wipe us out in one fell swoop. At this point, I immediately directed our troops to occupy a small hilltop, ordering everyone to hold their ground until the main force had bypassed the enemy and cut off their retreat, before we could move.

    As soon as the enemy saw us go up the mountain, mountain guns, field guns, howitzers, and mortar shells followed closely. In a short while, over three hundred shells landed on our position. Many of the pine trees on the mountain were blown down, and the fortifications were repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt by us. I saw that the soldiers all had angry eyes, wanting to vent the deep-seated hatred we had suppressed for so long on the enemy. The exploding stones flew everywhere around us. The American bandits' bombers, jets, and Mustang fighters flew low over our heads, one after another, crazily almost touching the mountaintop. I had seen more than once the beasts' planes bombing the houses of peaceful people, with mothers rushing into the fire to save their children. As I thought about this, I gripped the trigger of a machine gun. When another bomber swooped down over my head, I aimed at it and fired a long burst of steel bullets. The plane was hit by me and turned its head and ran, desperately flying high. From then on, no plane dared to fly low again.

    The disparity in strength between the enemy and us was so great that I knew this was a life-and-death battle. When over forty enemies circled around from behind the pine forest to our right rear, our machine guns and mortars followed closely. To make it easier to fire at the enemy, Comrade Tong Shifeng held the mortar tube with his hand to fire. After firing more than twenty rounds, a layer of skin on his hand was burned off, but he did not stop firing. He padded his hand with a cotton sleeve and continued to fire. We could clearly see that a dozen enemies had died in front of us.

    At this moment, a rushing sound vibrated. Looking into the distance, eleven tanks and armored cars were driving on the highway leading to us, raising dust, with infantry following on both sides.

    Before long, mortar platoon leader Li Tianming ran over and said to me: "Company commander, we plan to ambush them at the foot of the mountain. When the tanks get close, we'll use hand grenades and mortars to strike together, a fierce strike, what do you think?" Before I could answer him, a soldier from the first squad also ran over, saying: "Li Jinming has already damaged the leading armored car, blocking the road. The tanks behind are roaring and can't get past." When I heard this, I was really happy and immediately said to everyone, "How about we give Comrade Li Jinming a great merit?" Everyone shouted with a smile, "Good!"

    The enemy's planes and tanks could not play their role. But we knew the enemy would not let it go like this. At this time, our second and third platoons had been ordered to transfer to the outer layer to fight the enemy. Only one platoon was left on the mountain. I ordered them to organize a grenade-throwing team in each squad, and announced the discipline: save ammunition, do not throw grenades until the enemy is close, and do not throw grenades if the damage is not significant! Everyone pulled out the fuses of piles of hand grenades, preparing for it. The beasts thought we had all been "destroyed" by the artillery fire. They concentrated an unknown number of people from all directions, wanting to occupy our position, but they were repeatedly repelled by our fighters holding the mountain! The enemy's corpses piled up in front of our position. The enemy charged once, and there were more enemy corpses. Later, some of our comrades also suffered casualties.

    In the smoke-filled shell craters, I went back and forth to reorganize our combat organization, quickly finding people to replace the missing cadres. Our clothes and hats were riddled with bullet and shell fragments. We looked at our sacrificed comrades and shouted: "We will take revenge!"

    Although the sun was setting, the enemy knew we were few in number, but they just couldn't do anything to us. The enemy concentrated all the weapons of their entire regiment to fire at us, and used more than eight hundred people to continuously attack our position, which was less than a platoon. At this time, we shouted: "For the safety of our motherland and the liberation of the Korean people, we must fight the beasts to the end!" Seeing that the enemy was about to approach, even our wounded who could not fight stood up and fought with the enemy. Sometimes, one or two of us fought with hundreds of enemies. The gun barrels turned red, and Jiang Shitong, who was wounded in the head, was bleeding from the wound due to the "dang dang" of the gunshots. He pulled the gun tail and still fired so calmly, refusing others' persuasion and resolutely not leaving the firing line. He said, "If I can hold on for one minute, I can kill many enemies." The enemy was driven by our fighters to scramble and crawl, helpless a hundred meters away! The enemy planes kept circling over our heads, encouraging the enemy. At this time, the mortar squad only had three shells left; the first squad's machine gun only had half a bag of bullets; and each person had less than one hand grenade. Although the medic Niu Shuming took down the ammunition from the wounded and martyrs, it was eventually used up completely.

    Soon the enemy came up again densely packed. The comrades said there was no ammunition. I pointed to the ground and said, "These stones are good ammunition!" They turned around and ran back, concentrating all the stones under their feet, and tightened their belts, preparing for the death battle that was about to come. After I directed everyone to throw the stones out, the enemies who had been scared away turned around and returned because there was no explosion. At this time, all the stones that could be used were used up, and the enemy was also opposite us. When the situation was very tense, I shouted with all my strength: "We must win glory for the people of our motherland. If there are no stones, use iron picks and hoes to chop!" Before I finished speaking, squad leader Wang Jinyu grabbed an iron pick and chopped it on the enemy's head. It was already 3:30 in the afternoon. According to the scheduled time, our main force had already inserted behind the enemy to intercept them. Our task of holding the position and luring the enemy was completed. Taking advantage of the chaotic opportunity of the enemy being chopped, we decided to break through to the outside. Deputy instructor Comrade Gao Chengyun was seriously injured and lay on the blood-stained ground, gritting his teeth to cover us. When the enemy rushed to his side, he used the Mauser pistol bullets he had deliberately left behind to kill four enemies. When another enemy who came up reached out to capture him, he expressed his infinite loyalty to the people of the motherland and heroically sacrificed himself. The instructor and I led the way with two Mauser pistols, and everyone wielded hoes and iron picks. With a single cry of kill, we broke a bloody path and transferred to a favorable position on the periphery of the enemy.

    After this battle was won, the Korean people buried our martyrs on the top of this pine-forested and beautiful mountain with tears in their eyes. In order to forever commemorate this glorious deed, the famous Dongari Mountain was renamed "Iron Blood Mountain," and a large stone tablet was erected on the top of the mountain, with Chinese characters inscribed on it, recording the course of our platoon fighting against an enemy regiment and defeating the enemy's six encirclements. The inscription is profound and moving. One passage reads: "Here, we want to tell the descendants of our Korean people for generations to come that they must always remember that their happy life today was created by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who fought against America to aid Korea, using their high spirit of internationalism, and sacrificing their blood and heads for you!"

    From then on, the Korean people, whenever they passed by the mountain, looked up at the top of the mountain, remembering the glorious heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　铁血山
    志愿军某部连长战斗英雄  岳忠义
    我是志愿军某部的一个连长，去年十一月二十五号的黑夜，我军发动了第二次战役。我们这个连从里世洞出发，以急行军的速度前进着，当走到泰川郡的时候，前征部队已经从侧方向敌后插过去了。我们和李承晚匪军所谓“精锐第一师”的一个团打响了。当时敌人摸不清我们的情况，一直溃退。我们就紧顶着狠狠地向敌人边打边追。天亮后，敌人发现我们兵力小，就立刻散开来包围了我们。接着又调来十二架飞机，想一下消灭我们。这时候，我马上指挥我们的部队占领了一个小山头，命令大家，就地坚持，等到主力绕到敌人的后面切断敌人的退路以后，我们才能转移。
    敌人一见我们上山，山炮、野炮、榴弹炮和迫击炮弹紧紧跟过来。不多一会儿我们阵地上落了炮弹三百多发。山上的松树很多都被炸断了，掩体工事几次炸塌又被我们重修起来。我看见战士们都瞪着愤怒的眼睛，要对敌人发泄发泄我们长期压制着的深仇血恨。炸起来的石头在我们身旁边四处飞溅着。美国强盗的轰炸机、喷气式和野马式的战斗机，一架跟一架地在我们头上低飞着，疯狂得要擦着山顶了。我已经不只一次看见野兽们的飞机把和平人民的房子炸得冒着大火，看见母亲们到火里去抢她们的孩子。我一面想，一面拘住了一挺枪的扳机，当着又一架轰炸机俯冲到我头顶上的时候，我瞄着它狠狠地射击了一长串钢弹，飞机被我打得扭头就跑，拚命地往高飞，从此，没有一架再敢低飞了。
    敌我兵力悬殊到这样程度，我知道这是一场敌死我活的血战。当着四十多个敌人从松林背后绕到我们右后方的时候，我们的机枪和迫击炮也就瞄着跟了过来。为了便于向敌人发射，佟世风同志用手握着迫击炮筒发射。打了二十多发以后，他的手被烫焦了一层皮，可是他没有停止射击，垫上棉袄袖子还是打。敌人在我们前头死了十几个，我们看得非常清楚。
    这时候，有一阵哗哗的声音震动起来。远处一望，在通向我们这里来的公路上开来了十一辆坦克和装甲汽车，尘土飞扬着，步兵一左一右地跟随着。
    不大一会，迫击炮排长李天明跑来和我说：连长，我们计划埋伏在山下，等坦克近了，就用手榴弹和迫击炮一齐打，猛打，你看怎样？没等到我回答他的时候，一班的一个战士也跑来了，他说：李金明已经把最前头的一辆装甲车打坏了，挡住了路，后头的坦克老呜呜地叫着过不来。我一听真是高兴，马上向大家说，给李金明同志立个大功好不好啊？大家笑着喊，好！
    敌人的飞机、坦克都不能发挥它的作用了。但是我们知道敌人是不会就这样了事的。这时候，我们的二三排已经奉命转移到敌人外层去打，山上只剩下一排，我命令他们每班组织一个投弹组，并且宣布纪律，要节省弹药，敌人不近不准投弹，要是杀伤不多还是不准投！大家把一堆堆手榴弹的火线都拉出来，预备着。野兽们以为我们全部被炮火“毁灭”了，他们从四面八方集中了不知多少人，上来想占领我们的阵地，但他们一次一次地，被我们坚守在山上的战斗员们打退了！敌人的死尸在我们阵地前沿堆起来了。敌人往上冲一次，敌人的死尸就更多一些。后来我们的同志们也有了一些伤亡。
    在烟绕着的炮弹坑里，我过来过去整顿了我们的战斗组织，把缺少的干部赶紧找人代替起来。我们的衣裳、帽子，被子弹、炮弹片打了很多窟窿。我们望着牺牲的战友们，喊着：“我们要报仇！”
    虽然太阳平西了，敌人明知道我们人数不多，但就是不能怎样我们。敌人把他全团所有的武器，都集中向我们射击，又用了八百多人，向我们不满一个排的阵地连续地进攻。这时候我们喊：“为了我们祖国的安全和朝鲜人民的解放，要和野兽们拚到底！”眼看敌人要接近了，就连我们不能战斗的伤员们也挺起身子，和敌人拚起来。有时，我们一两个人就和数目过百的敌人拚上了。枪筒子打红了，头部负伤的姜世同，被“当当”的枪声震得伤口不住向外流血，他拉着枪尾，还是那么沉着地射击，拒绝别人的劝说坚决不下火线。他说，我能坚持一分钟，就能打死很多仇人。敌人被我们的战士们打得乱钻、乱爬，在百米开外，束手无策！敌人飞机还不住在我们头顶上盘旋，给敌人助胆。这时迫击炮班的炮弹，只剩下三发了；一班的机枪只有半袋子弹；手榴弹一个人合不上一个了。虽然卫生员牛书明又把伤员和烈士的弹药都解下来，但是最后还是打得一干二净了。
    很快敌人又密密层层地上来了，同志们说没弹药了，我指着地上说，这石头就是很好的弹药！他们翻身跑回去，便把脚下所有的石头集中起来，并且紧了紧腰带，准备着这场眼看就要到来的一场死拚。当我指挥大家把石头投出去以后，因为没响，吓跑的敌人转身又返回来。这时，一切可能使用的石头又打光了，敌人也到了我们的对面。情况正在十分紧张的时候，我使尽了气力喊着：要为我们祖国人民争光，石头没有了就用铁铣、洋镐劈呀！我的话还没说完，班长王金玉抢起了铁铣就照着敌人的头上劈下去。天已经是下午三点半钟，根据预定的时间，我们的主力已经插到敌人的后边去截住了敌人，我们坚守阵地诱住敌人的任务完成了，趁着敌人被砍劈的慌乱时机，我们决定向外突击。副指导员高成云同志负重伤躺在染红了的血地上，咬着牙掩护我们，当敌人冲到他的身边时，他用特意留下的驳壳枪子弹打死了四个敌人，当另外上来的敌人伸手要俘掳他的时候，他对祖国人民表示了无限的忠贞，壮烈牺牲了。我和指导员用两枝驳壳枪领头，大家抡起了洋镐、铁铣，一个杀声，我们杀出一条血路转移到敌人外围的有利的阵地上去。
    这个战斗胜利结束后，朝鲜的人民含着热泪，把我们的烈士安葬在这座松林青秀的山顶上。为了永远纪念这个光辉的事迹，把这座有名的东啊里山改名为“铁血山”，山顶上立上了大字石碑，上面用中国文字记载着我们一个排和敌人一个团作战，并打垮敌人六次围攻的经过。碑文深刻动人，有一段是：“在这里，要告诉我们朝鲜人民后辈世世代代的子孙们，要永远记着，你们今天的幸福生活，是过去中国人民抗美援朝志愿军，用他们高度国际主义精神，拚掉他们的鲜血和头颅，给你们创造的！”
    从此朝鲜的人民，每逢在山前路过时，他们仰望着山顶，怀念着中国人民志愿军光荣的英雄们。
