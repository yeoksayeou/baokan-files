Editor,

Was Mr. Sun Yu's subjective wish in directing "The Life of Wu Xun" good?

After reading Mr. Sun Yu's "Preliminary Understanding of the Mistakes I Made in 'The Life of Wu Xun'," I feel that this self-criticism is extremely superficial. Mr. Sun Yu mentioned the issue of "subjective wish" in his self-criticism, seemingly implying that his "subjective wish" was good. I completely agree with the opinions put forward by Comrades Yuan Shuipai and Ding Mangong on this point.

The movie "The Life of Wu Xun" is a literary work that wears the mask of the revolutionary people to promote reactionary ideas. In the movie, the director's "subjective wish" is very clearly expressed.

First of all, the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" uses "Wu Xun was a working person" as the starting point for propagating reactionary ideas. This played a significant role in deceiving the audience. Many people praised it after watching the movie, saying things like: "Ah! A great working person!" Comrade Duanmu Hongliang, in his article praising Wu Xun entitled "On The Life of Wu Xun" (published in Beijing Literature, Volume 2, Issue 1), stated right at the beginning: "Wu Xun was a working person." The movie also focused on glorifying Wu Xun's slavish demeanor, even resorting to raising the banner of "the noble qualities of diligence, bravery, and wisdom of the Chinese nation" to glorify him, in order to deceive the audience. For example, in the movie, when Xiao Tao criticized Wu Xun for always doing "dirty and hard work," Wu Xun replied: "If I don't do it, who will?" Clearly, the director attempted to glorify Wu Xun's shameless actions of willingly being a slave to the reactionary ruling class as the "noble qualities" of the working people.

The movie "The Life of Wu Xun" also viciously distorted and slandered the peasant revolutionary movement. It glorified Wu Xun's reactionary actions of "establishing free schools" to train running dogs for the feudal rulers as a "great ideal of serving the people," and even used distorted depictions of the revolutionary actions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary soldiers to serve as a contrast, which is intolerable.

Finally, the ending of the movie uses "depicting Wu Xun's failure in begging for and establishing schools and his discovery of his own pain after failure" as a "criticism" of Wu Xun. This "criticism," as Comrade Yuan Shuipai said in "Some Opinions After Reading Mr. Sun Yu's Self-Criticism," "only serves to further confuse the audience, regardless of the author's intentions." The author's depiction of Wu Xun later discovering his own failure and feeling pain because of it merely aims to give the audience the impression that Wu Xun always stood on the side of the working people and that he was always a member of the working people.

The movie "The Life of Wu Xun" promotes reactionary ideas, which shows that Mr. Sun Yu's thinking is extremely confused. I hope that Mr. Sun Yu will conduct a serious and profound self-criticism, which will be beneficial to the audience and to Mr. Sun Yu himself.

### 孙瑜先生编导《武训传》的主观愿望是好的吗？

　　孙瑜先生编导《武训传》的主观愿望是好的吗？编辑同志：
    读了电影《武训传》编导者孙瑜先生《我对〈武训传〉所犯错误的初步认识》一文，我觉得这个检讨是极不深刻的。孙瑜先生在检讨中提到了“主观愿望”问题，似乎说他的“主观愿望”是好的。对这一点，袁水拍和丁曼公两位同志提出的意见，我完全同意。
    电影《武训传》是一部装着革命人民的面孔来宣传反动思想的文艺作品。在电影中，编导者的“主观愿望”是表现得非常清楚的。
    首先，电影《武训传》以“武训是一个劳动人民”来作为其宣传反动思想的出发点。这对欺骗观众起了很大的作用。许多人看了这部电影以后，首先赞扬的就是：“啊！伟大的劳动人民！”端木蕻良同志在《论武训传》这篇颂扬武训的文章（刊北京文艺二卷一期）里劈头就说：“武训是一个劳动人民。”电影中又着重歌颂了武训的奴才相，甚至不惜打起“中华民族的勤劳、勇敢、智慧的崇高品质”的旗号来歌颂，以达到欺骗观众的目的。例如电影中小桃责备武训为什尽干“顶脏顶苦的活”时，武训回答：“我不干谁干。”很明显，编导者是企图把武训这种甘心为反动统治阶级做奴才的无耻行动来歌颂成劳动人民的“崇高品质”的。
    电影《武训传》又恶毒地歪曲和污蔑农民革命运动。它把武训以“兴义学”来训练封建统治者的走狗这一反动行动歌颂为“为人民服务的伟大理想”，甚至还用歪曲太平天国革命战士的革命行动来作反衬，这是令人不能容忍的。
    最后，电影片的结尾又用“描写武训行乞兴学的失败和他发现了他自己失败后的痛苦”，作为对武训的“批评”。这个“批评”，正如袁水拍同志在“读孙瑜先生检讨后的一点意见”中所说：“只有更加对观众起了迷惑的作用，不管作者的根据如何。”作者描写武训后来发现了他自己的失败，并因此而痛苦，无非要给观众一个印象，即以为武训始终是站在劳动人民的立场上的，他始终是劳动人民的一分子。
    电影《武训传》是宣传反动思想的，这说明：孙瑜先生的思想是极其混乱糊涂的。希望孙瑜先生认真地作深刻的自我检讨，这对观众，对孙瑜先生本人，都是有益处的。            北京大学三院  胡复中
