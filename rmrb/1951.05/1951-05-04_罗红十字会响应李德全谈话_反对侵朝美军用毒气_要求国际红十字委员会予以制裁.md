　　Romanian Red Cross Responds to Li Dequan's Statement
    Opposes US Military's Use of Poison Gas in Korea
    Demands Sanctions from the International Committee of the Red Cross
    [Report from this newspaper] The General Association of the Chinese Red Cross has received a telegram from Constanta Craciun, President of the Romanian Red Cross, stating that they are responding to the statement of Li Dequan, President of the General Association of the Chinese Red Cross, protesting the use of poison gas by the US military in Korea and demanding that the Geneva International Red Cross Committee and the International Red Cross Association stop this crime. The protest begins by saying: "We are extremely angry to learn that the US military, after suffering continuous defeats, is using poison gas and asphyxiating gas on the Korean battlefield, violating the most basic principles of international law. The Romanian People's Republic Red Cross is in complete agreement with the Chinese Red Cross's protest and its appeal to Red Cross members worldwide. The Romanian People's Republic Red Cross demands respect for the Geneva Conventions and opposition to the use of weapons of mass destruction that are intolerable to the honor and conscience of the people."

    The protest concludes: "We demand that the International Committee of the Red Cross immediately intervene regarding the use of toxic asphyxiating gas, take practical measures to stop this despicable crime, and, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, impose sanctions on those who use this gas."
