　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 23rd—When a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army ambushed the retreating U.S. 24th Division southeast of Paochon-gun, at the Jiangkoudong (江口洞), on April 24th, they destroyed eighteen enemy tanks and two armored vehicles within three hours. In this battle, Pan Zeming, the vice squad leader of the second squad of a certain company of the unit, single-handedly destroyed three enemy tanks with eight rocket-propelled grenades in one hour. Together with another rocket launcher shooter, Yang Yicai, he also destroyed one tank. He created an example of combining bravery with skill and was awarded the honorary title of "Anti-Tank Hero" by the leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
　　That morning, the warriors of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured Yunyue Mountain, which controls Jiangkoudong (江口洞), cutting off the retreat of the routed U.S. 24th Division. At 3 p.m., the Chinese People's Volunteer Army suddenly launched an attack on the enemy in Jiangkoudong (江口洞). The enemy's tanks, armored vehicles, and trucks were thrown into chaos, trying to break through to the south. Pan Zeming's group carried the large rocket launcher they had captured only yesterday, passed through the enemy's machine gun fire blockade, chose favorable terrain, and opened fire on the enemy tank group. His first rocket-propelled grenade destroyed a tank ninety meters away from him. Then he quickly destroyed the second tank with two more rocket-propelled grenades. At this time, the nearby enemy tanks concentrated their machine gun fire on him. Pan Zeming cleverly moved to the west side of the highway, only fifty meters away from the enemy tank group, selected a good position, and was about to start shooting the third tank when it was destroyed by Yang Yicai, the rocket launcher shooter of the third squad. He turned his rocket launcher again and fired three consecutive shots at the fourth tank, all hitting the head of the tank. Encouraged by Company Commander Zhang Yiren, Pan Zeming quickly advanced towards the fifth tank. When he hit the head of this tank, a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Yang Yicai also hit the abdomen of the tank.
　　At this time, the anti-tank squads of other companies also approached the enemy tanks with brave and rapid actions, throwing anti-tank grenades and armor-piercing projectiles. Wang Yongsheng and his team members Tang Shirong and Wang Lin destroyed three enemy tanks with anti-tank grenades and armor-piercing projectiles in eleven minutes. The three warriors Li Benzhi, Li Duiyu, and Chen Tiangong also set two tanks and one armored vehicle on fire. The warriors of another Chinese People's Volunteer Army anti-tank company and infantry company also destroyed eight enemy tanks and one armored vehicle on this position. Among them, Xiang Guoqing, a signalman of a certain company who had just learned to use anti-tank grenades, picked up an anti-tank grenade and rushed to a place only two meters away from the enemy tank, destroying a tank.
　　In the enthusiastic tank-killing competition, the warriors shouted, "Turn the enemy's living bunkers into dead turtles!" After a fierce battle, there were twenty such dead turtles on the position in Jiangkoudong (江口洞). After this battle, the warriors of this unit had even greater confidence in fighting tanks. They said, "Don't look at how big it is and how scary it looks. As long as we are brave and have good skills, no matter how big it is, it will be useless."

　　志愿军某部在三小时内毁敌坦克十八辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】中国人民志愿军某部于四月二十四日在抱川郡东南江口洞截击南逃的美军第二十四师的时候，三小时内击毁敌军坦克十八辆，装甲车二辆。在这一战斗中，该部某连第二班副班长潘泽明，在一小时内用八发火箭弹单独击毁敌军坦克三辆，又和另一火箭筒射手杨义才共同击毁了一辆，创造了勇敢与技术相结合的范例，因此被志愿军领导机关授予“反坦克英雄”的光荣称号。
    那天清晨，志愿军某部的勇士们攻占了控制江口洞的云岳山，截断了溃逃的美军第二十四师的逃路。下午三时，志愿军向江口洞守敌突然发起攻击，敌军的坦克、装甲车、卡车顿时乱成一团，企图夺路南逃。潘泽明小组扛起昨天才缴获来的大型火箭筒，穿过敌人机枪的火力封锁线，选择了有利地形，对敌人坦克群展开射击。他的第一发火箭弹，击毁了一辆距他九十公尺远的坦克。接着他又迅速用两发火箭弹击毁了第二辆。这时附近的敌人坦克集中机枪火力向他射击。潘泽明机智地转移到距敌人坦克群只有五十多公尺的公路西侧，选择好阵地，正要开始射击第三辆坦克时，它却被第三班班长火箭筒射手杨义才所击毁了。他又转过火箭筒口，对着第四辆坦克连射三发，都打中了坦克的头部。在连长张益仁鼓励之下，潘泽明又迅速地向第五辆坦克跃进。当他击中了这辆坦克的头部时，杨义才打的一发火箭弹也正好击中了坦克的腹部。
    这时，其它连队的反坦克小组也以勇敢迅速的动作，接近敌人坦克，用反坦克炸弹和穿甲弹投射过去。王永生和他的组员唐水荣、王霖，在十一分钟内用反坦克炸弹和穿甲弹击毁敌人坦克三辆。李本智、李兑如、陈天功三勇士也同样地把两辆坦克和一辆装甲车打得起火燃烧。另部志愿军的反坦克连和步兵连的勇士们，也在这一阵地上打毁了敌人的八辆坦克和一辆装甲车。其中某连才学会使用反坦克炸弹的通讯员项国清，拿起一个反坦克炸弹冲到距敌坦克只有二公尺多的地方，炸毁了一辆坦克。
    在热烈的打坦克竞赛中，勇士们喊着：“把敌人的活地堡变成死乌龟！”一场激战之后，江口洞的阵地上就摆着二十个这样的死乌龟。经过这次战斗，该部勇士们打坦克的信心更加高了，他们说：“别看它个儿大，样子怪吓唬人的，只要我们胆子大，技术好，它的个儿再大也不中用。”
