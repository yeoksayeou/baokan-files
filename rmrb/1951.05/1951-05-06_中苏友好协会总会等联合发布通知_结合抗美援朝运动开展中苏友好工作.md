　　Joint Notice from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and Others
    Integrating Sino-Soviet Friendship Work with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, in conjunction with various people's organizations, issued a notice on cooperating to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship work in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. The full text is as follows:
    Enhancing and consolidating the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and promoting the exchange of all the wisdom and experience of the two great nations, is the greatest interest and urgent requirement of our people. At present, our people are universally and deeply carrying out the great Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. We should combine this movement to continue to strengthen and develop the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, so that the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement can play an even greater role in defending national security and world peace. To this end, we suggest:
    (1) All national people's organizations should, in conjunction with their central tasks, actively promote the propaganda and education of Sino-Soviet friendship among their members and non-member masses, further enhance the understanding of the Soviet Union as a bulwark of world peace and as China's most reliable friend, thoroughly eliminate the residual impact of anti-Soviet propaganda carried out by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang among our people for a long time, and gradually combine their own work to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The broad masses of cultural and artistic workers, in particular, should use their weapons to launch various creations with Sino-Soviet friendship as the theme.
    (2) Mobilize their members and the surrounding masses to actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and assist in establishing branches or sub-branches of the association in places or units where the organization does not exist; organize themselves according to the association's organizational system and the methods prescribed by the association. Grassroots organizations of trade unions, peasant associations, student federations, and educational trade unions in various localities can refer to the "Provisional Regulations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters on Several Organizational Details" to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members.
    (3) In order to do the above work well, each people's organization may, according to the actual situation, designate a special person or establish an appropriate organization to be responsible for planning and guiding the development of Sino-Soviet friendship work within the organization. These responsible persons and working bodies should maintain close contact with the local same-level friendship association. Each people's organization should send representatives to participate in the council of the same-level friendship association, so that the resolutions and requirements of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels can be promptly conveyed to the people's organizations and become a powerful action.

　　中苏友好协会总会等联合发布通知
    结合抗美援朝运动开展中苏友好工作
    中苏友好协会总会联合各人民团体发布关于结合抗美援朝运动协力开展中苏友好工作的通知。全文如下：
    增进和巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和合作，促进中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流，是我国人民的最大利益和迫切的要求。目前我国人民正在普及和深入开展伟大的抗美援朝运动，我们应结合这一运动，继续加强与发展中苏两国人民的友好和合作，从而使抗美援朝运动在保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平的工作中发挥更加伟大的作用。为此我们建议：
    （一）全国各人民团体应结合自己的中心任务，在广大会员和非会员群众中积极推行中苏友好的宣传和教育，更加提高对苏联作为世界和平堡垒、作为中国最可靠的朋友的认识，彻底肃清美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮在我国人民中长时期进行反苏宣传所造成的残余影响，逐渐结合自己的业务，学习苏联的先进经验。广大的文化艺术工作者，尤应使用自己的武器，展开以中苏友好为主题的各种创作。
    （二）发动自己的会员和周围的群众积极地参加中苏友好协会，在没有该会组织的地方或单位，要协助建立该会的分会或支会；依照该会的组织系统和该会所规定的方法组织起来。各地工会、农民协会、学联、教育工会的基层组织可以参照“中苏友好协会总会关于若干组织细则的暂行规定”，加入中苏友好协会为团体会员。
    （三）各人民团体为要做好上述工作，可按实际情况推定专人或建立适当的组织负责计划、指导在本团体内开展中苏友好工作，这些负责人和工作机构应与当地同级友协保持密切的联系。各人民团体应推派代表参加同级友协的干事会，使各级中苏友好协会的决议和要求能及时地传达到各人民团体中去，并成为强有力的行动。
