　　To Further Improve Union Financial Management
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Decides to Issue Union Membership Fee Coupons in Installments
    In order to further improve the financial management of trade unions and facilitate the payment of membership fees by members across the country, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), after signing a contract with the People's Bank of China for the issuance of union membership fee coupons, has decided to begin issuing these coupons in installments starting July 1, 1951. The first phase will be a trial run, starting simultaneously in twenty-three cities: Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Shenyang, Changchun, Lushun, Dalian, Harbin, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Kaifeng, Xi'an, and Chongqing. It will then be gradually rolled out to other areas.

    On the 20th of this month, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China jointly issued a notice to the national committees of various industrial unions, major administrative regions (ACFTU offices), the five provinces and two cities of North China, Inner Mongolia, and the branches of the People's Bank of China in the Yellow River region and the Head Office's business office, instructing:

    (1) In all cities that have already been designated to issue union membership fee coupons, if the trade unions have established grassroots treasuries, they must first purchase membership fee coupons with the membership fees collected from July onwards. Otherwise, the local bank acting as the grassroots treasury should refuse to accept the fees.

    (2) In locations that have not yet been designated to issue union membership fee coupons, if the trade unions have established grassroots treasuries, the grassroots organizations of these trade unions may apply to purchase the coupons from banks in nearby cities that have already been designated to issue them. If it is not possible to purchase union membership fee coupons due to inconvenient transportation, the original method of depositing funds into the treasury, as stipulated by the union treasury regulations, may still be followed.

    (3) Trade unions that have not yet established grassroots treasuries are not allowed to apply to purchase union membership fee coupons.

　　进一步健全工会财务管理
    全国总工会决定分期发行会费券
    中华全国总工会为进一步健全工会的财务管理，并便于全国各地会员缴纳会费起见，经中华全国总工会与中国人民银行双方签订发行工会会费券合同，并决定自一九五一年七月一日起开始分期发行工会会费券。开始第一期首先在北京、天津、太原、唐山、沈阳、长春、旅顺、大连、哈尔滨、抚顺、鞍山、本溪、上海、南京、无锡、青岛、汉口、广州、南昌、长沙、开封、西安、重庆等二十三个城市同时先后试办，嗣后再行逐步推广。
    中华全国总工会、中国人民银行总行在本月二十日向各产业工会全国委员会、各大行政区（全国总工会办事处）、华北五省二市、内蒙、黄河总工会人民银行各区分行、总行营业处发出联合通知，指示：
    （一）凡已代理发行工会会费券的各城市，其工会已建立基层库者，自七月份起，所收会员会费，必须先行购买会费券。否则，当地代理基层库的银行应予拒收。
    （二）尚未开始代理发行工会会费券的地点，其工会已建立基层库者，得由该工会基层组织，备款向邻近城市已代理发行工会会费券的银行请购。如因交通不便未能购领工会会费券者，得仍以现款按照工会金库原规定缴库办法办理。
    （三）目前未建立基层库的工会，不得申请购领工会会费券。
