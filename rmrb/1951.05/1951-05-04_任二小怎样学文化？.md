　　Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory
　　Ren Erxiao is an old worker who has been working for thirty-three years and is forty-five years old this year. At the age of twelve, he worked as a handyman on the Zhengtai Railway, and at the age of fifteen, he worked as a handyman at the Daxing Yarn Factory. At the age of twenty, he learned to weave cloth, and at the age of twenty-seven, he learned to be a machine repairman. After liberation, he was promoted to leader of the cloth factory team, and later became an assistant and administrator of cloth factory Class C. In November 1948, he gloriously joined the Communist Party.
　　Because Ren Erxiao was illiterate, he often encountered difficulties in his work. When others took slips to collect things, asking him to sign and stamp, he didn't know what was written. He couldn't write the shift log when handing over shifts, and he couldn't take notes during meetings. He felt that without culture, it would be difficult to learn politics, and how could he do his job if he didn't understand things? Last July, he joined the study program, determined to learn to take notes and read newspapers within two or three years.
　　Comrade Ren Erxiao's learning attitude is honest, serious, humble, patient, and arduous, and he has perseverance, determination, and is not afraid of any difficulties. He is always full of learning spirit. He is not only a labor model in production, but also a model student in learning.
　　His learning method is from shallow to deep, learning characters with fewer strokes first, and then characters with more strokes. When he started learning, he only required himself to be able to pronounce the characters, but now he requires himself to master four skills: speaking, writing, using, and reading. He has a good spirit of diligent study, never being impatient or greedy. He practices a character he has learned frequently until he has mastered it. Once, when he learned the two characters "gong gu" (consolidate), when repairing his house at home, he wrote them on a wooden board, reciting these two characters while mixing mud. He always strives to take the initiative in learning. When the teacher asks the students, he always raises his hand first and says, "Let me speak. If I say something wrong, please give me more advice."
　　He also fully demonstrates the spirit of applying what he learns. When handing over shifts at work, you will see the words he writes on the blackboard, such as: "A certain department needs to add a few people, a certain department needs how many people." Also, such as: "Install lights on the east road, the yarn frame needs to send a regular car." And so on. He tries his best to find ways to use the characters he has learned in his work.
　　Ren Erxiao always feels that being old, slow-witted, and forgetful is a great pain, so he created many new methods to overcome difficulties. Being old and having blurry vision, sometimes he can't see the characters in the textbook clearly, so he saves money to buy a magnifying glass. But what to do about having a bad memory? He learned the character "jian" (build) for construction, but couldn't remember it for three days. So he used familiar homophones to help him remember, and asked people when he forgot. He also wrote new words on the blackboard. He always carries chalk with him and writes whenever he has nothing to do. There are characters written in chalk all over his house and yard.
　　He always thinks about learning, and everywhere he goes is a place to learn. When he sees someone, he says, "Teach me a character." On the way home, he also studies characters with his fellow workers. His active learning has motivated many elderly people and even young people to participate in learning. However, some individual elderly workers still think, "I've lived most of my life, I forget everything easily, what's the point of learning?" and are unwilling to participate in learning. Ren Erxiao often goes to persuade them, using himself as an example to move them, saying, "Learn every day, year after year, let's see if you can learn it or not?"
　　After a year of hard study, Ren Erxiao has already recognized more than 500 characters. He can speak, use, write, and read each character. Now, he can use simple words to write suggestions, approve slips to collect things, and can also read simple tabloids. He says arithmetic "is the most troublesome thing," but he has now learned to calculate simple multiplication and division.

　　任二小怎样学文化？
         石家庄大兴纺织厂
    任二小是个做了三十三年工的老工人，今年四十五岁了。十二岁他就在正太路当小工，十五岁又到大兴纱厂当小工，二十岁学织布，二十七岁学机匠。解放后，他被提升为布厂组长，以后又当了助理员、布厂丙班的管理员。一九四八年十一月，他光荣地参加了共产党。
    任二小因为不识字，在工作中常常感到困难。别人拿条子领东西，叫他签字盖章，他不知写的是什么。交班时他写不了交班值日簿，开会时也不会写记录。他觉得没有文化就不容易学政治，不懂事又怎么搞工作？去年七月他就参加了学习，立志要在两三年内学会记录、看报。
    任二小同志的学习态度是老实、认真、虚心、耐心、艰苦的，而且有毅力、有恒心，不怕任何困难，学习精神经常饱满。他不但在生产上是一位劳动模范，在学习上也是一位模范学员。
    他的学习方法是由浅入深，先学笔划少的，后学笔划多的。他开始学习时只要求自己会念就行，现在则要求学到四会。他的钻研精神很好，绝不犯急性病，也不贪多。他学了一个字，经常练习，直到学会为止。有一次他学了“巩固”两个字，在家里修房时，便写到木板上，一边和泥，一边念着这两个字。他在学习上总是争取主动，当教员问同学的时候，他总是先举手说：“我来说吧，要是说错了，请大家多提意见。”
    他更充分发挥了学以致用的精神，学了就用。在工作交班的时候，你会看到他在黑板上写的字，如：“某部需要添几人，某部需要多少人。”又如：“东头马路上按灯，牵纱架子须要派个正车。”等字样。他把过去所学的一些字，都尽可能的想方法利用到工作上去。
    任二小总感觉年老心笨、好忘是件天大的痛苦事情，于是他创造了许多新的方法来克服困难。年岁大了眼睛花了，课本上的字有时看不清，他就节省钱买了一个放大镜。可是记性不好怎么办呢？他学了建设的“建”字，三天就没记住。于是他就用熟悉的同音字来帮助记忆，忘了便问人。他还把生字写在黑板上。他身上总带着粉笔，没事就写，家里院里都有他用粉笔写的字。
    他脑子里老是想着学习，走到那儿那儿是学习。见了人他就说：“你别我一个字。”在回家的路上，他也和同伴工人研究字。他的积极学习，曾带动了不少老年人甚至青年人，使他们参加了学习。但个别老年工友仍认为“自己多半辈子了，什么事都好忘，还学什么？”不愿参加学习。任二小便常去劝告，并拿自己做例子，感动对方，说：“天天学，成年累月的学，你看学成学不成？”
    经过一年的苦学，任二小已经认识五百多字了，每个字他都会讲、会用、会写、会念。现在，他能用简单的文字写建议、批条子领东西，也能读简单的小报了。他说算术“是最麻烦的东西”，但是他现在已经学会算简易的乘除法。
