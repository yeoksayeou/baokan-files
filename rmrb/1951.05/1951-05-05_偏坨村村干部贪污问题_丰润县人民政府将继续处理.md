To the Editor:

We read the letter "Masses of Pian Tuo Village Accuse Village Chief of Embezzlement, Fengrun County Government Delays Handling for a Year" in the People's Daily on April 11th. We began handling this matter in the autumn of 1949. Because that year was a disaster year, the embezzling village cadres were unable to compensate for all the stolen goods, so the government, based on the economic situation of the embezzling cadres, ordered them to compensate for a portion and dismissed the main embezzlers from their positions. After this resolution (which in reality did not resolve the issue – Editor), the masses were still not satisfied and demanded that all the embezzled items be recovered. However, because we were vigorously leading disaster relief work at the time (the village was one of the most severely affected), we put this issue aside. In 1950, we handled it twice more, but without result.

After the criticism was published in the newspaper, we originally planned to go immediately to resolve it, but because it is now the peak season for production and the office has very few staff remaining, we could not spare anyone to go to the village to handle it immediately. Therefore, we are writing to inform you first. We plan to resolve this issue quickly after the production work is somewhat under control, and we will provide a detailed report on the handling results separately.

### 偏坨村村干部贪污问题  丰润县人民政府将继续处理

　　偏坨村村干部贪污问题
    丰润县人民政府将继续处理编辑同志：
    我们在四月十一日人民日报上读到了“偏坨村群众控告村长贪污，丰润县政府拖延一年未处理”的来信。这件事情，我们在一九四九年秋季就开始处理。因为那时是灾年，贪污的村干部，无力赔偿全部赃物，政府便根据贪污干部经济情况，令他赔出了一部分；并将主要贪污分子撤职。这样解决后（实际上并没有解决——编者），群众仍不满意，要求将贪污东西全部追出来。但因为当时正在大力领导救灾工作（该村是重灾村之一），就将此问题放下了。一九五○年又处理两次，也未得到结果。
    报上登出批评后，我们本打算马上前往解决，但因现在正是大生产时期，机关留的人员很少，一时抽不出专人到该村处理，所以先写信告诉你们；对于这个问题，我们准备在生产工作有些头绪后，即迅速去解决，处理结果将另作详细报告。
