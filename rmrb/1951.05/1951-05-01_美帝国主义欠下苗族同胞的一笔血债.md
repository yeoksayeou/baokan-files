　　American Imperialism Owes a Blood Debt to the Miao People

　　Central Institute for Nationalities Pan Guangcheng

　　I am a Miao child. I want to accuse American imperialism of a blood debt owed to us Miao people, a debt I have personally experienced and witnessed.

　　In the year before Japan's surrender, due to the reactionary policies of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who consistently pursued passive resistance against Japan and active opposition to communism, the Kuomintang army retreated from Hunan and Guangxi all the way to Guizhou. However, at this time, American imperialism provided the Kuomintang with a large number of "American-equipped divisions," and built airfields on our territory, preparing to help the Chiang bandits fight the civil war. At that time, I was only thirteen or fourteen years old and was one of the millions of poor Miao compatriots who were forced by the Chiang bandit gang to build an airport for the Americans in Huangping County.

　　The Huangping Airport project was very large. Most of the workers who built the airport were Miao compatriots from Lushan, Huangping, Duyun, Dushan, Leishan, Taijiang, Pingyue, Zhenyuan, and Shibing counties in the southeastern Guizhou area. Some were captured by the Kuomintang army, some were forcibly assigned by the reactionary government, and some were unreasonably punished by the reactionary government, using manpower to offset their "crimes." Among them were young men and women, children of thirteen or fourteen years old, and old men and old women in their sixties and seventies, some even carrying illnesses. Most of these people were very poor. They were barefoot, wearing ragged clothes, and were driven here in groups, monitored by bayonets and whips, or tied with ropes, leaving their parents, wives, and children at home to freeze and starve to death.

　　My father and I were "assigned" to work in shifts. I remember that the winter of that year was particularly cold, and the suffering we endured at the airport was endless. We were given two meals a day of half-grain and half-chaff, which were not enough to fill our stomachs. We slept in the cold open fields, working day and night to rush the project for them. Every night, batches of people worked until dawn. Strong people were exhausted until their faces were yellow and thin, and those who were too sick to move were also forced to work; the old, the weak, and the sick died in batches. Corpses were buried next to the airport every day. On every road, there were people constantly carrying the corpses of their relatives. There were also many unclaimed corpses that were dragged away and casually covered with two shovels of dirt at both ends of the airport.

　　Every morning and evening, American planes were constantly taking off and landing. The airport was full of people, but the imperialists did not treat us as human beings! They regarded our lives as less valuable than ants. When planes landed or took off, tragic accidents of people being crushed to death often occurred. One night, around ten o'clock, we were working when an American plane suddenly landed about four or five zhang away from me. There were many people working in this area, and suddenly there was a burst of screams as if the sky and earth had overturned. I secretly went to see, in that area, about three hundred meters long and five meters wide, all the people working in this area were killed. Those who were alive just now, all of a sudden became piles and piles of minced meat. In the pool of blood, here was a head, there was a foot, here was a hand, there was half a body. Some people only saw bloody clumps, some people were broken into five or six pieces, and some were crushed into the soil, almost without even bones left. This tragic and appalling picture still makes me shudder when I think about it. Among the dead were old men, women, young people, and children of thirteen or fourteen years old. When everyone went to look for their family members, the whole field of workers erupted in roaring and crying. Sons went to look for their parents, parents went to look for their sons, brothers went to look for brothers, men went to look for their wives. Some searched all night without finding anything, and some could not recognize the dead because they had changed their appearance. Many people could only identify the dead by the scars on their bodies, the shape of their feet, their clothes, or the pipe beside them. An old man hugged his only son, who had lost a foot, and shouted loudly: "Oh, God, oh, God, my mother!" He sang a sad song: "Why is life so bitter? Why is the family so poor? When will there be peace, so we can turn over?" Another very young woman found her husband, who had been pinned down by the plane's wing, neither dead nor alive, unable to speak. She held him in the pool of blood, crying as she watched him die. There was also a pitiful father, an old man in his sixties, who came to the airport with his two sons and two daughters. Unfortunately, on another night, all four of his children were crushed to death by an American plane, leaving this lonely old man, who searched until dawn, only finding two feet of one daughter by the style of the shoes.

　　The sea of blood and deep hatred is endless. These are only a small part of the countless blood debts owed to us by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We Miao compatriots will never forget these hatreds. We, the liberated Miao compatriots, firmly support the Communist Party and the People's Government, and vow to fight to the death against the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism.

### 美帝国主义欠下苗族同胞的一笔血债

　　美帝国主义欠下苗族同胞的一笔血债
    中央民族学院  潘光成
    我是一个苗族的孩子。我要控诉我亲身经历的和亲眼看见的美帝国主义欠我们苗族同胞的一笔血债。
    日本投降的前一年，由于蒋介石匪帮一贯实行消极抗日、积极反共的反动政策，国民党军队从湖南、广西一直溃退到贵州。可是，美帝国主义却在这时大量给国民党装备“美械师”，在我国领土上大修飞机场，准备帮助蒋匪打内战。那时我还只有十三四岁，也是被蒋匪帮强迫去到黄平县替美国人修飞机场的千百万苗族贫苦同胞中的一个。
    黄平飞机场的工程非常大，修飞机场的工人大部分是住在黔东地区炉山、黄平、都匀、独山、雷山、台江、平越、镇远、施秉等县的苗族同胞。有的是由国民党军队抓来的，有的是由反动政府强迫派来的，也有的是由反动政府无理处罪，以人力来抵“罪”的。这里面有青壮年男女，有十三四岁的小孩子，也有六七十岁的老头子和带病的老太太。这些人绝大部分是十分贫苦的。他们光着脚，穿着破破烂烂的衣裳，一群群地被刺刀、皮鞭监视着，或者被用绳子捆绑着赶到这儿来，丢下爷娘妻子在家里冻死饿杀。
    我和我的父亲是被轮流“派”来做工的。我记得，那年的冬天特别冷，我们在机场所遭受的痛苦是说不完的。我们每天两顿半谷半糠的饭都吃不饱，露宿在冷冰冰的野地里，白天黑夜地替他们赶工，每夜有成批的人一直工作到天亮。健壮的人被累得脸黄肌瘦，病得不能动了的也被赶去作工；老弱的、带病的一批一批地死去。机场旁边天天有人埋死尸。条条大路上，不断地有收尸的人，抬着自己的亲人走过。还有许多没有人认领的尸体，就被拖去随便掩两锹土堆在机场的两头。
    每天早晨和天黑，美国飞机就在不断地起飞、降落。机场上遍地是人，但是，帝国主义那里把我们当作人啊！他们看我们的性命比蚂蚁的还不如。当飞机降落或者起飞的时候，时常发生压死人的惨案。有一天的晚上，大约十点钟左右，我们正在作工，一架美国飞机忽然在离我面前四五丈远的地方降下来。这个地区作工的人非常多，顿时天翻地覆似地发出了一片惨叫声。我偷偷地跑去看，那一带，长约三百公尺，宽约五公尺，所有在这区域内作工的人全部死光了。刚才还是活生生的人，一下子都变成了成堆成堆的肉泥。在血泊里，这里一个头，那里一只脚，这里一只手，那里半个身子。有的人只看到血糊糊的一团团，有的人变成五六段，有的被压到泥土里，几乎连骨头都没有了。这一幅惨绝人寰的图画，我至今想起来还胆战心惊。死者里面有老头、有妇女、有青年，也有十三四岁的小孩子。当各人去寻认自家人的时候，全场工人发出沸腾似的吼声和哭声。有儿子去寻找自己的父母，有父母去寻儿子，有兄弟去找兄弟，有男人去找自己的妻子。有的找了一晚也没有找到手，有的因死者变样了不能认识，许多人只能凭尸身上的疮疤、脚样、衣裳或身边的烟杆来认定死者是什么人。有一个老头抱着自己失去了一只脚的独生儿在那里大声地叫：天呀，天呀，我的妈！他唱着悲伤的歌曲：“命为什么这样的苦？家为什么这样的穷？什么时候才能太平，我们才能够得翻身？”又一个很年轻的妇女找到了自己的丈夫，丈夫已被飞机翅膀压在那儿死不死活不活地不能说话了。她在血泊里抱着他号啕着眼看他死去。还有一个可怜的父亲，六十几岁的老头子，他和两男两女都到机场来了，不幸在另一天的晚上，四个儿女全被美国飞机压死了，剩下这孤零零的老头，一直找到天明，还只凭鞋子的式样找到了一个女儿的两只脚。
    血海深仇是说不完的。这些还只是美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮所欠下我们无数血债里的一小部分。我们苗族同胞永远忘不了这些仇恨。我们获得了解放的苗族同胞，坚决拥护共产党和人民政府，誓死反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
