Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 25th: Our correspondent reports: From April 22nd to May 21st, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched two powerful counterattacks in succession against the U.S., British, and other invading armies and the Syngman Rhee puppet army in the central region of Korea, and engaged in skirmishes with the enemy between the two counterattacks. In these 30 days of combat, our army achieved a brilliant victory of annihilating 46,302 enemy troops, and pushed the enemy back 50 to 70 kilometers across the entire front. The U.S., British, and other invading armies and the Syngman Rhee puppet army launched an adventurous offensive against the Korean and Chinese People's Armies starting on January 25th this year, with the goal of attempting to advance to the Wonsan-Anju line, establish a "defense line" in the waist of the Korean Peninsula, and then invade the Chinese border along the Yalu River. The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army maintained a high degree of operational mobility, resolutely annihilating the enemy's active forces in favorable areas. The counterattack operations conducted by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies in the past 30 days were carried out in two stages: From April 22nd to 29th for the first stage, our army annihilated a total of 23,163 enemy troops. From May 16th to 21st, our army launched the second stage of the counterattack against the enemy, annihilating another 17,931 enemy troops in five days and nights. In this operation, the Rhee puppet army's 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th Divisions, as well as the U.S. 2nd Division and the French Battalion, were severely hit. Our army liberated Xiangyang City and drove the Rhee puppet army entrenched in the east coast area back to the area south of the 38th parallel. Between the two counterattacks, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies maintained skirmishes with the enemy on the entire front, killing, wounding, and capturing 5,208 enemy troops from April 30th to May 15th. The counterattack operations of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies have resulted in the complete failure of the U.S. invading army's arrogant plan to first occupy the Wonsan-Anju waist area.
