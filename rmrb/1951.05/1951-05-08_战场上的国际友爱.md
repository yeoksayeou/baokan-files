　　International Friendship on the Battlefield
　　By our correspondent Lin Wei
　　February 14th, noon, the Han River front was unusually calm. There was no wind, no clouds, and the early spring sunshine already had warmth. If it weren't for the occasional enemy plane streaking across the sky, and the occasional sound of artillery fire from afar, people would almost feel like they were in a peaceful environment. On the northern bank of the Han River within Guangzhou territory, the soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers spread thick rice straw in their newly constructed earthworks and sat down cross-legged with satisfaction. While wiping their guns, they enthusiastically talked about their experiences in past battles. One Yi comrade hummed a pleasant mountain song that no one could understand. In the command post of a certain regiment, the deputy division commander was speaking to the responsible comrades of the regiment: "Tell all the soldiers that 'the position is there as long as the person is there' was the slogan when the situation required us to hold a certain position. Now that we have fought enough on the south bank of the Han River according to the predetermined date, we have won a victory! We should no longer stick to the old slogan. Our purpose is not defense, but to create conditions for annihilating the enemy. We are not afraid of the enemy crawling in like turtles..."
　　Suddenly, not far from the south, a burst of artillery fire sounded "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh." Immediately afterward, the observation staff officer called and said: "More than a hundred Korean People's Army soldiers are walking out of the woods on the sandbar between the north and south Han Rivers, and are heading north, seemingly to cross the river; the enemy has discovered them, and more than ten artillery pieces from four artillery positions are chasing them." The deputy division commander stopped speaking and immediately peered out with his binoculars. After two or three more bursts of artillery fire, he shouted with joy like a child: "Comrades, come and see, it's a good sight!"
　　At this time, what was presented in the binoculars was a very touching scene: American artillery shells were exploding vigorously in the midst of the ranks of the People's Army soldiers, but these soldiers not only did not run away in a panic like American soldiers do when being pursued, but didn't even change their speed of advance at all. They maintained a neat and uniform distance interval, with each person about forty or fifty meters away from the next. When the shells came, they lay down calmly on the ground, and then got up calmly, marching steadily as before. It was as if they were not near the enemy's front line at all, but in a distant place that the enemy could not reach. They must have believed that the enemy would not dare to come after them.
　　"What good soldiers!" the deputy division commander praised to himself, smiling. The other comrades in the regiment were also fascinated by the sight, staring intently.
　　The enemy's new trick indeed came: before, they were firing impact-fuse shells, now they switched to air-burst shells. The shells exploded in groups dozens of meters above the ground, and a large number of shrapnel poured onto the ground with flying sparks. However, after a long series of barrages, the effect was still the same. Those being attacked seemed to be completely unaware of this new trick, and continued as before, and there were no casualties at all. Gradually, they had approached the Han River. There, they calmly tested the thickness of the ice in various places, looking for places to cross the river.
　　At around two o'clock in the afternoon, a portion of the soldiers walked onto the ice. The comrades on the Volunteer Army side were anticipating a warm meeting. However, things suddenly became serious: the enemy probably saw that the air-burst shells were not effective, so they suddenly used impact-fuse shells to aim at the river surface. The shells smashed into the ice, blasting open large holes. If they continued to fire like this, the ice would collapse before the soldiers could cross the river. The deputy division commander couldn't help but shout "Damn," and the smile disappeared from his face. He turned around and was about to say something when the telephone rang, it was the observation staff officer again. He repeatedly requested to quickly open fire to provide support. At this time, two questions flashed through the deputy division commander's mind like lightning: if we don't open fire, this group of friendly soldiers, such good soldiers, will be beaten into the river; if we open fire, the artillery positions will be exposed immediately, and enemy planes will come to retaliate, causing our own casualties. But this was quickly resolved. He simply drew out his voice and said "Ah—," and immediately issued an order to the artillery commander to concentrate fire from several artillery positions at once.
　　Deafening artillery fire "boomed" for a while, and sixty or seventy shells were fired. The enemy's four artillery positions were silenced. More than a hundred soldiers of the People's Army entered the northern bank of the river safely. On the Volunteer Army's riverside positions, a burst of victorious cheers rose. They forgot the threat of enemy fire and welcomed their comrades-in-arms, who spoke a different language, into their comfortable cave dwellings.
　　The deputy division commander's prediction was correct. American reconnaissance planes, bombers, and fighter planes immediately flew in, a total of nine. They circled around looking for the Volunteer Army's artillery positions, and strings of bombs fell down. Several places caught fire. At the same time, the enemy's artillery also followed the targets indicated by the planes and reorganized to open fire again. At this time, the People's Army soldiers and the Volunteer Army soldiers sat in the cave dwellings and smiled at each other. They asked each other many questions, but no one could understand anyone. They shook their heads and still smiled. The shells and bombs shook the cave dwellings, but could not change this joyful atmosphere in the slightest. Only the Volunteer Army comrades on the artillery positions were watching carefully, and the camouflage of each artillery position was being tested.
　　Half an hour passed, the enemy planes flew away "victoriously," and the artillery fire gradually became sparse. The command post's telephone rang for a while, and the final result was: not a single artillery piece was hit, but six Volunteer Army soldiers were injured. When other comrades comforted these wounded soldiers, the wounded soldiers replied: "Of course it hurts a little, but we are happy in our hearts: the comrades of the People's Army have all come over!"

　　On the front line, wherever the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side, this great internationalist love is overflowing everywhere. Many similar incidents can be found to the above.
　　In the early part of February, during the defense of a certain area on the south bank of the Han River, a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army fought alongside a portion of the Korean People's Army. One evening, this regiment of the Volunteer Army received an order from their superiors to transfer a portion of their positions to the People's Army to take over. The People's Army arrived, and the Volunteer Army comrades introduced them to the enemy situation and the terrain, and after introducing the terrain, they checked the condition of the fortifications, and then explained in detail the enemy's activity patterns and our defensive combat experience. After everything was done, the Volunteer Army comrades were still afraid that the People's Army comrades were not familiar with the area, and that accidents might occur during battle. So they deployed their troops on the periphery of the position to help defend it. They guarded it all night, and were still worried the next day, so they helped fight for another day. Only when they saw that the People's Army comrades were truly familiar with it did they withdraw.
　　When another part of the same regiment was transferring its positions to the People's Army, a piece of the original position had already been seized by a superior enemy. The Volunteer Army comrades discussed: according to convention, the transfer could be made as soon as the order arrived, regardless of the situation. However, in this situation, it would be difficult for the People's Army comrades to defend it after taking over. They would suffer more casualties. As a result of the discussion, it was decided: immediately launch a counterattack, take back the lost position, and then hand over the defense. In order to retake this piece of position, the Volunteer Army comrades inevitably suffered some casualties. But when they transferred it to the People's Army comrades, the terrain situation was relatively favorable for defense.
　　The comrades of the People's Army, with the same noble and selfless enthusiasm, automatically helped the Chinese People's Volunteers solve various difficulties in life and combat, even rescuing the wounded from the front lines. On February 10th, reconnaissance personnel Zhao Dongquan and other comrades of a certain unit of the People's Army braved the bombing of enemy planes and artillery to carry two wounded Volunteer Army soldiers for ten miles on the south bank of the Han River. When they reached the Han River, they found two broken boats and risked their lives to row across. The boat broke, and the wounded fell into the icy water. They jumped into the icy water to rescue them, and then continued rowing. After crossing the river, they carried them for another seven miles and sent them directly to the Volunteer Army's medical organs. When the wounded expressed their gratitude to them, they replied: "This is our duty, it is our obligation to do our part. We will never forget the blood shed by the Volunteer Army for our Korean people."

　　战场上的国际友爱
    本报记者  林韦
    二月十四日正午，汉江前线呈现着稀有的平静。没有风，没有云，初春的阳光已有暖意。如果不是偶而有敌机掠过天空，偶而有炮声从远处传来，人们几乎要觉得这是和平环境了。在广州境内汉江北岸的志愿军某部战士们，在自己新构筑的土木工事里铺上厚厚的稻草，满意地盘腿而坐。一面擦拭枪枝，一面兴致勃勃地谈论各自在过去战斗中的见闻。有一个彝族的同志，咿咿唔唔地唱着悦耳的但是谁也听不懂的山歌。在某团的指挥所里，副师长正在给团的负责同志们讲话：“要告诉所有的战士，人在阵地在，那是形势要求我们坚守某一阵地时的口号。现在我们在汉江南岸按照预定的日期打够了，我们就是打了胜仗！不应该再坚持旧的口号。我们的目的并不是防御，而是创造歼灭敌人的条件。我们不怕敌人乌龟式的爬进……。”
    忽然间，南面不远处“唿通通通”响了一阵排炮。紧接着，观测参谋打来电话说：“有一百多名朝鲜人民军战士，从南北汉江中间沙滩上的树林里走出来，正向北前进，似乎是要过江；敌人发现了他们，四个炮兵阵地的十多门大炮在追击他们。”副师长停止了讲话，马上探出头用望远镜去观看。排炮一连又打过两三阵，他便像孩子一样高兴地喊起来：“同志们，快来看，好看得很呃！”
    这时候，望远镜里展现着的是一个非常感动人的场面：美国的大炮弹一股劲在人民军战士们的行列中间爆炸，这些战士们却不仅没有一个像美国兵被追击时那样羊子似地哄跑，甚至连前进的速度也没有变更一点点。他们保持着整齐匀称的距离间隔，一个人离另一个人都是四、五十公尺的样子。炮弹打来的时候，他们不慌不忙地卧在地上，然后又不慌不忙爬起来，照样稳步行进。好像根本不是在敌人前沿阵地的附近，而是在敌人不可能到达的远方似的，他们一定相信敌人是不敢跑来追他们的。
    “多好的战士啊！”副师长自言自语地赞美着，微笑着。团里的其他同志，也看得着了迷似的，目不转睛一直看。
    敌人的新花样果然来了：以前打的是顺发（碰炸）炮，现在改为空炸炮了。炮弹在离地数十公尺处成群地爆炸，大量的弹片随着四射的火花倾注到地面上。但是，一阵接一阵地打了好久，效果还是一样。被打者好像完全没有发觉这个新花样似的，照旧行事，并且始终一无伤亡。渐渐地，他们已经接近到汉江边上来了。他们在那儿从容不迫地试探各处江冰的厚薄，找寻过江的处所。
    下午两点左右，一部分战士走到冰面上来了。这边的志愿军同志们在期待一个热情的会晤。可是，事情突然严重化了：敌人大概是看见空炸炮弹也不能奏效的缘故吧，现在忽然又用顺发炮瞄准江面打起来。炮弹砸在冰上，炸开大大的窟窿。如果照这样一直打下去，不等战士们过了江，冰层就要坍了。副师长不由自主地喊了一声“糟糕”，笑容从脸上消失了。他回过头来正要说什么，忽然电话铃响了，又是那个观测参谋。他连声地请求赶快开炮支援。这时候，副师长脑子里闪电似地闪过两个问题：不开炮呢？这一批友军战士，这么好的战士，眼看就会被打到江底；开炮呢？炮兵阵地一暴露，敌机马上就会来报复，造成自己的伤亡。但是，这很快就被解决了。他只拉长嗓子“呵——”了一声，马上便向炮兵指挥员发出命令，要好几个炮兵阵地一齐集中发射。
    震耳欲聋的炮声“轰隆”了一阵，六、七十发炮弹出去了。敌人的四个炮兵阵地都哑了。人民军一百多名战士，全部平安无事地进入江北沙滩。在志愿军的江边阵地上，腾起一阵胜利的欢呼。他们忘记了敌人炮火的威胁，把不通语言的战友欢迎到自己舒适的窑洞里来。
    副师长的预计没有错，美国的侦察机、轰炸机和战斗机马上飞来了，一共是九架。它们转着圈子找寻志愿军的炮兵阵地，一溜一溜的炸弹打下来。好几个地方起了火。与此同时，敌人的大炮也跟着飞机指示的目标，重新组织起来开了火。这时候，人民军战士和志愿军战士安坐在窑洞里相对而笑。他们互相问了许多话，但谁也听不懂谁。摇摇头，还是笑。炮弹炸弹震得窑洞里一耸一耸地，但不能丝毫改变这欢快的气氛。只有炮兵阵地上的志愿军同志们在小心翼翼地注视着，每个炮兵阵地的伪装都在经受着考验。
    半点钟过去了，敌机昂着头“胜利地”飞走了，大炮也渐渐打得稀疏了。指挥所的电话忙了一阵，最后的结果是：炮一个没有被炸着，但有六个志愿军战士负伤了。在别的同志们慰问这些伤员时，伤员们回答说：“痛当然痛一点，可是我们心里高兴：人民军的同志们都过来了！”

    在火线上，在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的地方，这种国际主义的伟大的热爱到处洋溢着。与上述相类似的事情，还可以找到很多。
    二月初头汉江南岸某地保卫战中，志愿军某团与一部分朝鲜人民军并肩战斗。有一天晚间，志愿军这个团接到上级命令，将一部分阵地移交人民军接防。人民军开到了，志愿军同志给他们介绍了敌情又介绍地形，介绍了地形又察看工事状况，然后又详细介绍敌人的活动规律和我们的守备作战经验。一切都弄好了，志愿军同志还怕人民军同志对这儿不熟悉，打起仗来可能发生意外。于是把自己部队布置在阵地外围，帮着守卫。夜里守了一夜，第二天还不放心，又帮着打了一天。看着人民军同志真熟悉了，自己才撤下来。
    同一个团的另一部分在移交阵地给人民军时，原阵地已被优势敌人抢去一块。志愿军同志们商量：按惯例，命令一到就可以移交，不管情况怎样。可是，现在这个样子，人民军同志接过去不好守呀。他们会多伤亡的。商量的结果，决定：马上发动反攻，把失去的阵地夺回来，然后交防。为夺回这块阵地，志愿军同志不可免地伤亡了一些人。可是当他们移交给人民军同志时，阵地形势却比较地有利于防守了。
    人民军的同志，以同样高尚的忘我的热情，自动帮助中国人民志愿军解决生活上和战斗中的各种困难，以至从火线上抢救伤员。二月十日，人民军某部侦察员赵东权等同志，曾经冒着敌人飞机大炮的轰击，背着志愿军两个伤员在汉江南岸走了十来里。到汉江边上，又找了两只破船，拼着命往过摇。船坏了，伤员落了水，他们跳进冰水里救起来，再继续摇。过江以后，又背着送了七里，直接送到志愿军的卫生机关。伤员向他们表示感谢时，他们回答：“这是我们分内的事，是我们应尽的一点义务。志愿军为我们朝鲜人民流的血，我们永远不会忘记。”
