Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch: Visiting delegates from various countries who participated in the May Day parade in Moscow shared their profound impressions with TASS reporters. Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation, stated: I witnessed a demonstration of the forces of peace defending the cause of world peace under the leadership of the great Stalin. Hundreds of thousands of people marching through Red Square cheered us, and I and other members of the Chinese delegation were delighted to see how great the Soviet people's sympathy for the freedom-loving Korea and our country is. The demonstration in Red Square convinced us that Sino-Soviet friendship is unbreakable, and no friendship is more solid than ours.

Chen Daixing, a member of the Korean-Soviet Cultural Association delegation and a hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: The military review in Red Square once again demonstrated how strong the Soviet state is in defending peace. We were greatly encouraged and pleased to hear tens of thousands of demonstrators paying tribute to Korea.

Wechsler of the American Workers Delegation said: In Red Square, we saw that the Soviet people are truly the masters of their country, and the Soviet people themselves are the organizers and participants of this magnificent celebration. We felt the Soviet people's love, sincerity, and friendly feelings toward the people of other countries. We witnessed a sight that is very rare for Americans. As our delegation left Red Square, a group of Soviet youths surrounded the black members of our delegation, showered them with flowers like rain, warmly shook their hands, and carried them on their shoulders across Red Square.

Harris, a member of the British Workers Delegation, said: In the May Day demonstration, I understood the source of the enthusiasm shown by the Soviet people in building a new life. Because in the Soviet Union, the people and the government are united.

Representatives from Bulgaria, India, France, Italy, Denmark, and Sweden all stated in their talks that they were deeply moved by the unforgettable impression given to them by the May Day parade in Moscow.
