Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Teams in Various Regions
    Participate in Summer Harvest and Summer Seed Selection Competition
    Accepting the Challenge from 47 Mutual Aid Teams in Xingping County

To respond to the development of the summer harvest and summer seed selection production competition, recently, another forty-two agricultural production mutual aid teams across the country have formulated summer harvest and summer seed selection production plans, accepting the challenge from forty-seven mutual aid teams in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province. The challenging mutual aid teams include: twenty-seven mutual aid teams including Wang Donglin, agricultural labor model of Jia County, Henan Province; Jia Huibang mutual aid team of Chuxian County, northern Anhui; and fourteen agricultural model mutual aid teams of Puxian County, Pingyuan Province. Among them, the fourteen mutual aid teams in Puxian County also proposed challenging all labor models and mutual aid teams in the province.

The challenge plan of the twenty-seven mutual aid teams in Jia County, Henan Province, stipulates that all preparations for large and small farm tools, sites, and manpower and animal power required for wheat harvesting should be completed seven days before the wheat harvest. Mobilize men, women, old and young to participate in the wheat harvest, ensuring completion of cutting in three days, threshing in five days, and stacking in ten days. Also ensure thorough cutting and threshing. Strengthen militia night patrols and sentry duty, organize children to guard wheat fields and threshing grounds during the day, and strictly prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries. Also pay attention to fire prevention, wind prevention, and rain prevention. Select and retain fine wheat varieties according to soil quality and climate, achieving separate threshing, separate harvesting, and separate storage. Ensure seed purity reaches 100% and uniformity reaches 95% to 100%. After completing the summer harvest, summer seed selection, and summer planting, each mutual aid team will compare manure piles, crops, harvests, and yields by township, district, and county, evaluate seeds, and elect production experts and models. All public grain will be handed over completely according to the dates stipulated by the government.

The Jia Huibang mutual aid team of Chuxian County, northern Anhui, wrote in its challenge conditions: all large and small farm tools needed for the summer harvest have been prepared, and all four sites of the team are being renovated and will be completed five days before the summer harvest. Organize both male and female full and semi-laborers to carry out a summer harvest and summer seed selection assault, striving to complete the team's wheat harvest within ten days and ensure the land is clean and the threshing ground is clear. Our team will conduct patrols at night to watch the wheat, ensuring that the wheat does not suffer losses during the wheat harvest. The five mu and three fen of improved wheat seeds sown by the whole team last winter will all be selected and retained this summer; ordinary wheat will be selected by section and segment. The method of selection is: remove impurities and inferior seeds, pull out diseased plants, and thresh and store separately. After the agricultural tax is levied, the whole team guarantees to pay off the public grain at one time within two days.

The challenge conditions of the fourteen model mutual aid teams in Puxian County particularly emphasize planting immediately after harvesting, seizing the opportunity to plant when it rains, and spot planting when it doesn't, ensuring no delay in farming. In order to make the wheat grow well and prevent diseases next year, they proposed making good field spike selection and separate threshing and separate storage methods to make the wheat seed purity reach 98%. In order to complete the above plan, they proposed mobilizing all male laborers to participate in the wheat harvest, ensuring that the harvest is completed in ten days. During the wheat harvest, in order to prevent sabotage by saboteurs, they decided to rectify the wheat protection organization to ensure that no losses are suffered. After the agricultural tax is levied this summer, they guarantee to dry and winnow the public grain and hand it over in full within three days.

    河南省郏县二十七个互助组的应战计划上规定：麦收需用的一切大小农具及场地、人畜力的调配等准备工作，在麦收七天前完成。动员男女老幼参加麦收，保证三天割完、五天打完、十天上垛。并保证作到割净、打净。加强民兵夜间巡逻、放哨，组织儿童白天看守麦田、麦场，严防反革命分子破坏。并注意防火、防风、防雨。按土质、气候选留小麦良种，作到单打、单收、单放。保证种籽纯度达到百分之百，整齐度百分之九十五到百分之百。在完成夏收、夏选和夏种以后，各互助组即按乡、按区、按县比粪堆，比庄稼，比作物，比收成，评种籽，选举生产能手和模范。按照政府规定日期全部缴完公粮。
    皖北滁县贾惠邦互助组在应战条件中写道：夏收中所需的一切大小农具我们都已准备好了，全组四个场地现正在整修着，保证在夏收前五天修好。组织男女整半劳动力突击进行夏收、夏选，争取全组的麦收在十天内完成并做到地净场光。我们全组晚上进行巡逻看麦，保证麦收中麦子不遭受损失。全组于去冬播种的五亩三分改良麦种，今夏全部选留种籽；普通麦子进行片选和段选，选的方法是：去杂去劣，拔除病株，单打单藏。农业税开征后，全组保证两天内将应征公粮一次缴清。
    濮县十四个模范互助组的应战条件中，特别强调随收随种，有雨抢种，无雨点种，保证不误农时。为使明年麦子长的好，不生病，提出作好田间穗选及单打单藏的办法，使麦种纯度达到百分之九十八。为完成上述计划，他们提出动员男劳动力全部参加麦收，保证十天收割完毕。在麦收期间，为防止破坏分子捣乱，他们决定把护麦组织整顿好，保证不遭到损失。今年夏季农业税开征后，他们保证将公粮晒干扬净，三天之内全部缴清。
