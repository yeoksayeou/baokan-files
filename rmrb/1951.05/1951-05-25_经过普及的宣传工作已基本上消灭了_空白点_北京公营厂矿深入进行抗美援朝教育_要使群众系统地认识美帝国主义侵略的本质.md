　　After Popularized Propaganda Work, "Blank Spots" Have Been Basically Eliminated:
    Beijing's State-Owned Factories and Mines Conduct In-Depth Education on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Aiming to Systematically Acquaint the Masses with the Aggressive Nature of American Imperialism

    In the popularized and in-depth propaganda work on Resisting America and Aiding Korea carried out by Beijing's state-owned factories and mining enterprises since April, "blank spots" have been basically eliminated. Currently, they are further utilizing regular propaganda work to enable workers to systematically understand the aggressive nature of American imperialism.

    Although the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea carried out by Beijing's state-owned factories and mining enterprises from November of last year to March of this year achieved considerable results, it was not widespread or in-depth enough. Some units did not regard this propaganda work as a regular political task, but rather carried it out intermittently. Some units only paid attention to workers and neglected staff, or only paid attention to direct production departments and neglected affiliated departments, only paying attention to basic workers and neglecting temporary workers and odd-job workers. Since April, through popular and in-depth efforts, "blank spots" in propaganda work have now been basically eliminated. According to statistics from twenty units, workers generally received twenty sessions of Resisting America and Aiding Korea education in April. 93.5% of workers participated in the signature campaign to support the Five Great Powers in concluding a peace pact and voting against the US arming Japan. According to investigations and tests conducted by seven units, including the People's Printing Factory and the Tram Company, about half of the workers clearly understood the current major current affairs issues, about 40% generally understood them, and only 10% remained confused or indifferent to current affairs.

    The main experiences of Beijing's state-owned factories and mining enterprises in popularizing and deepening the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea since April are: First, relying on the Communist Party's propagandists, uniting all the active elements of the masses in propaganda work, and jointly carrying out propaganda work. According to statistics from thirteen units, including Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing Electric Power Bureau, and Qinghe Woolen Mill, a total of 1,760 active members of the masses in propaganda work emerged in April, greatly increasing the strength of oral propaganda. Moreover, more than 3,500 propaganda cartoons were drawn, more than 170 blackboards were set up, 69 reading groups were organized, and dramas and clapperdoge performances were staged more than 197 times. This enabled the popularization work to proceed smoothly. Second, implementing a responsibility system for propaganda work, unifying the deployment of propaganda content, and specifically assigning tasks to cadres, propagandists, and active elements. The responsibility system adopted two methods: "contracting" by region and dividing work by propaganda form. This guaranteed the popularization work. Mentougou Coal Mine and Beijing Electric Power Bureau and other units have achieved success in this way. Third, combining the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea with production mobilization and the current central work. The People's Printing Factory combined production mobilization, using large-scale cartoons to illustrate that "one error released an enemy," which immediately aroused the workers' attention to product quality. In the third week of April, five teams in the factory's inspection and sealing workshop did not make a single mistake. The Liulihe Cement Plant combined the propaganda of Resisting America and Aiding Korea with anti-waste in the labor competition movement, saving 50 million yuan in the first half of April. In addition, many factories and mining enterprises combined the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and labor insurance card registration with the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, achieving great results. This made the propaganda effect embodied in the actual actions of the workers, making the propaganda work regular.

    At present, although the workers of Beijing's state-owned factories and mining enterprises have a general understanding of current affairs issues, their understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism is not very systematic. In order to further enhance the understanding of workers in regular propaganda work, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is now specifically guiding the party committees of various factories and mining enterprises to summarize the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in the past period, and then, in conjunction with the current central work, formulate a regular plan for the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and conduct regular inspections; establish and improve the propaganda network of workers and the masses, so that propagandists and the masses can establish regular and fixed contacts; improve the reading of newspapers and insist on the system of explaining current affairs for a few minutes before class in spare-time schools; inspect the observance and implementation of patriotic covenants, and help groups that have not yet established patriotic covenants to establish patriotic covenants; strengthen the propaganda work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in weak workshops or departments, and prevent complacency and relaxation.

　　经过普及的宣传工作已基本上消灭了“空白点”
    北京公营厂矿深入进行抗美援朝教育
    要使群众系统地认识美帝国主义侵略的本质
    北京市各公营厂矿企业在四月份以来的普及深入抗美援朝的宣传工作中已基本上消灭了“空白点”，目前正进一步在经常化的宣传工作中使职工们系统地了解美帝国主义的侵略本质。
    北京市各公营厂矿企业自去年十一月至今年三月的抗美援朝宣传工作，虽有不少成绩，但还不够普遍与深入。有的单位还没有把这一宣传工作当作经常的政治任务，而是时冷时热，断断续续地进行。有的单位只注意工人而忽视了职员，或者是只注意直接生产部门而忽视了附属部门，只注意基本工人而忽视了临时工和勤杂工。四月份以来，经过普及深入的努力，宣传工作上的“空白点”现已基本上消灭了。据二十个单位的统计，职工们在四月份内一般的已受到二十次抗美援朝教育，有百分之九十三点五的职工参加了拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名和反对美国武装日本的投票。又据人民印刷厂和电车公司等七个单位的调查和测验，职工们对当前几个主要时事问题已经认识清楚的约占半数，大体懂得的占百分之四十，认识糊涂或对时事漠不关心的只剩百分之十。
    四月份以来北京各公营厂矿企业普及深入抗美援朝宣传工作的主要经验是：第一是依靠共产党的宣传员，团结一切宣传工作的群众积极分子，共同进行宣传工作。据石景山钢铁厂、北京电业局、清河制呢厂等十三个单位的统计，四月份共涌现一千七百六十个宣传工作的群众积极分子，使口头宣传的力量大大增加，而且绘制了三千五百余张宣传漫画，办了一百七十余块黑板报，组织了六十九个读报组，演出话剧、快板等一百九十七次。这就使普及工作得以顺利进行。第二是实行宣传工作的负责制，统一布置宣传内容，干部、宣传员与积极分子具体分工。负责制采取按地区“包干”和按宣传形式分工两种办法。这就使普及工作得到保证。门头沟煤矿和北京电业局等单位，就是这样取得成绩的。第三是把抗美援朝的宣传工作与生产鼓动和当前中心工作结合起来。人民印刷厂结合生产鼓动，用大幅漫画说明“出一个错误就是放走一个敌人”，当即引起职工们对产品质量的重视，该厂检封车间四月份第三个星期就有五个小组没出一个错误。琉璃河水泥厂把抗美援朝的宣传与劳动竞赛运动中的反浪费结合起来，全厂四月份上半月即节省了五千万元。此外，很多厂矿企业都结合镇压反革命和劳动保险卡片登记，进行抗美援朝的宣传工作，收到很大成绩。这就使宣传效果体现在职工群众的实际行动中，使宣传工作经常化。
    目前，北京公营厂矿企业的职工，虽然对时事问题有了一般的了解，但对美帝国主义侵略本质的认识还不很系统。为了进一步在经常化的宣传工作中提高职工认识，中共北京市委现正具体指导各厂矿企业的党委，总结过去一个时期的抗美援朝宣传工作，再结合当前中心工作，订出抗美援朝宣传工作经常化的计划，并定期进行检查；建立和健全职工群众的宣传网，使宣传员和群众建立起经常的固定的联系；改进读报工作，并坚持业余学校课前几分钟讲解时事的制度；检查爱国公约的遵守和执行，并帮助尚未订立爱国公约的小组订立爱国公约；加强宣传工作薄弱的车间或部门的抗美援朝宣传工作，并防止自满松懈情绪。
