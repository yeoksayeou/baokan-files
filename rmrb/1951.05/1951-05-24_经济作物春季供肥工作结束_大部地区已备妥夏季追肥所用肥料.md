Economic Crop Spring Fertilization Work Concludes
Most Regions Have Prepared Fertilizer for Summer Topdressing

Since the beginning of spring, cooperatives in various regions have actively cooperated with the agricultural production increase movement to supply farmers with the fertilizers needed during the planting season, and have achieved great results. Most regions have also prepared the fertilizer needed for summer topdressing.

Since mid-April, cooperatives in North China adopted the method of selling fertilizer on credit combined with advance purchase, quickly overcoming the phenomenon of fertilizer stagnation. Up to now, more than 170 million jin of various fertilizers have been sold (excluding Shanxi Province), successfully completing the plan. The fertilizer supply in Pingyuan Province exceeded last year by 76 percent. Shaanxi Province in the Northwest region also sold 3.5 million jin. Incomplete statistics from East China show that 120 million jin have been sold, completing 80 percent of the original plan. There are no specific statistics for the Central South region, but the demand for fertilizer in this region has always exceeded supply.

Almost all of the fertilizer supplied in various regions has been placed in economic crop areas. About 80 percent of it is sold to farmers on credit in combination with the advance purchase of cotton, hemp, and tobacco leaves. According to reports from Shandong, northern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu, 40 million jin of cotton, 6 million jin of tobacco leaves in northern Anhui, and 20 million jin of hemp have been pre-purchased through fertilizer supply. The pricing for advance purchases in various regions is based on the national cotton-grain, tobacco-grain, and hemp-grain price ratios, and some specific regulations have been made. Summarizing these, there are the following types: (1) Fertilizer is converted into currency at the prevailing local market price with a monthly interest rate of 1.5 percent, and the actual goods are collected at the local market price after the autumn harvest. (2) Both fertilizer and pre-purchased products are priced according to the market price and then converted into a real commodity price ratio, and the pre-purchased products are collected according to the real commodity price ratio after the autumn harvest. For example, Hebei and Shanxi provinces stipulate that 100 jin of soybean cake can be exchanged for 60 to 65 jin of wheat, or 23.5 jin of seed cotton; in areas farther from the railway line, it can be exchanged for 26 jin of seed cotton. (3) Shandong adopts the method of pricing twice after the autumn harvest. That is, the fertilizer and pre-purchased products are not priced temporarily, but are priced according to the company's prevailing local market price after the autumn harvest. Of the above three methods, the first two are more reasonable, while the latter is likely to cause farmers to worry and is not conducive to the cooperative's economic accounting, so it should not be adopted.

At present, the spring plowing and sowing period is nearing completion. The fertilizers needed by farmers for summer topdressing have been purchased in Hebei, Pingyuan, and other provinces. Other regions have also largely prepared them. The fertilizer needed in the tobacco areas of Central South (especially Henan) is still insufficient. Efforts should be immediately mobilized to strengthen the summer fertilizer procurement work and promptly promote the experience of combining advance purchase with the spring work, and continue to carry out the advance purchase contract movement.

### 经济作物春季供肥工作结束  大部地区已备妥夏季追肥所用肥料

　　经济作物春季供肥工作结束
    大部地区已备妥夏季追肥所用肥料
    入春以来，各地合作社积极配合农业增产运动，供应农民播种时期所需要的肥料，已取得很大成绩。夏季追肥所需肥料，大部地区亦已备妥。
    华北各地合作社自四月中旬采取赊销肥料结合预购的方式以后，迅速克服了肥料滞销现象。到目前止，已销出各种肥料一亿七千余万斤（缺山西省），按计划顺利完成。平原省供肥量超过去年百分之七十六。西北区陕西省亦销出三百五十万斤。华东区不完全统计，已销出一亿二千万斤，完成原计划百分之八十。中南区无具体统计，但该区肥料始终是供不应求的。
    各地所供肥料，几乎全部放在经济作物地区。其中百分之八十左右，是结合预购棉、麻、烟叶，赊销给农民的。据山东、苏北、皖南、皖北、苏南等地报告，供肥中已预购棉花四千万斤，皖北预购烟叶六百万斤，麻二千万斤。预购作价，各地均根据国家规定的棉粮、烟粮、麻粮比价，且已作了若干具体规定。归纳起来有以下几种：（一）肥料按当时当地牌价折成货币，月息一分五厘，秋收后按当地牌价收回实物。（二）肥料与预购之产品，均按牌价作价，再折成实物比价，秋收后按实物比价收回预购之产品。如河北、山西等省规定豆饼百斤换小麦六十到六十五斤，换籽棉二十三斤半，离铁路线较远的地区换籽棉二十六斤。（三）山东采取秋后两作价方式。即肥料和预购产品暂不作价，到秋收后，均按当时当地公司牌价作价。以上三种方式，以前两种较为合理，后一种易使农民发生顾虑，对合作社的经济核算也不利，不宜采用。
    目前春耕播种期已近结束。农民夏季所需追肥，河北、平原等省已采购完毕。其他各地也已大部备妥。中南（特别是河南）烟区所需肥料尚不充分，应即动员力量，加强夏季肥料采购工作；并及时推广春季结合预购进行工作的经验，继续开展预购合同运动。
