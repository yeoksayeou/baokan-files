　　Toasting Chairman Mao
    (Inner Mongolia) Meiliqige
    The sprouted elm tree,
     Grows more luxuriantly with rain;
     A child seeing its mother,
     How can it not feel close!
　
     Red flowers grow in green grass,
     Making the prairie even more beautiful;
     It is the greatest honor of my life,
     To sit together with the great leader.
　
     The clear glass is filled with wine,
     I raise it high above my head with both hands,
     Wishing fraternal nationalities great unity,
     Wishing Chairman Mao, the leader of all nationalities in China, good health.
　
     Chairman Mao listened carefully to my words,
     He replied with a smile: Wishing the Mongolian nationality well!
     His warm hand tightly grasped my hand,
     His affectionate eyes never left me.
　
     At that time my heart was beating fast,
     I just smiled and couldn't say anything else.
     After coming back I often think of it,
     I even woke up laughing in my sleep several times.
　
     A single iron rod is easy to break,
     A twisted rope cannot be pulled apart;
     The nationalities of China are united tightly,
     To defend our freedom, happiness, and peace!

　　举杯祝福毛主席
    （内蒙）  美利其格
    发了芽的榆树，
     得了雨水更茂盛；
     孩子见了母亲，
     怎么能不亲近！
　
     红花长在绿草里，
     草原显得更美丽；
     这是我一生最大的光荣，
     和伟大的领袖坐在一起。
　
     透明的杯子里斟满酒，
     我双手高高举过头，
     祝福兄弟民族大团结，
     祝福中华各民族的领袖毛主席。
　
     毛主席仔细听着我的话，
     他微笑地回答：祝福蒙古民族！
     他那温暖的手把我的手紧握，
     他那亲热的眼睛不离我身。
　
     当时我的心跳得厉害，
     只是笑，再也说不出话来。
     回来以后我常常想起，
     睡梦里也笑醒了几回。
　
     独根的铁棍容易折，
     拧成的麻绳拉不断；
     中华各民族团结紧，
     保卫我们的自由、幸福、和平！
