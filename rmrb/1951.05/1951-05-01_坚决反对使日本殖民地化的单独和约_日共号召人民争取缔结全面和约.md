　　Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party held its Fourth National Congress from February 23rd to 27th. At the close of the meeting, the Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a "Declaration for Striving for a Comprehensive Peace Treaty with Japan, Demanding the Withdrawal of All Occupation Forces After the Conclusion of a Comprehensive Peace Treaty, and Opposing the Rearmament of Japan" to the workers and people of Japan. The Japanese Communist Party publication "Guidelines for Party Activities" published the full text of the declaration on March 21st.
    The declaration first exposed that American imperialism is now arming Japan's land, sea, and air forces, establishing military bases, restoring arms production, and driving the Japanese to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. The declaration pointed out that the real purpose of the American and Japanese reactionaries in rearming Japan is to use Japan's territory and people against the Soviet Union and China in a new world war. The declaration said: After the failure of the intervention war against the Korean people, the reactionaries at home and abroad are more blatantly and on a larger scale pushing forward their ambitious plans. They are preparing to use West Germany and Japan as forward strongholds in their war plans. If we fail to thwart this plan, we will be driven to wage war against the Soviet Union and China, and our country will be forced to repeat the crimes it committed under the leadership of the warlords in the past. If Japan is used as a forward stronghold, it will inevitably fall into the suffering of war.
    The declaration continued: The entire Japanese people hope that all foreign troops will withdraw and that they will have their own independent government, independent economy, and culture. Japan's current foreign rule is incompatible with its national dignity, and it is also the main reason why the people of the whole country live in unbearable hardship. All the Japanese people are counting on the resolution of the peace treaty issue to restore their national dignity and free them from all this suffering.
    The declaration pointed out: Dulles and Yoshida have said that if a separate peace treaty with Japan is signed, American financial giants will continue to stay in Japan, Japan's economy will be controlled by American financial giants, and Japan's militarized territory and people will be used by the United States to achieve its military goals. In other words, the US policy of colonizing and rearming Japan will further deepen the suffering of the Japanese people. Moreover, continuing to maintain a hostile relationship with the Soviet Union and China after the conclusion of a separate peace treaty, and Japan's rearmament to attack the Soviet Union and China, will cause anxiety and opposition from the people of the world, and will make the reactionaries at home and abroad more desperately adventurous, and will eventually make Japan the fuse of the Third World War. If we embark on this path, our country will become a battlefield, our homes will be burned down, wives will lose their husbands, children will lose their parents, and our nation will suffer an extremely tragic fate. The scorched-earth tactics implemented by the US Air Force in Korea tell us that such a fate is also waiting for Japan. We do not want our motherland and nation to be destroyed. Therefore, we oppose a separate peace treaty with Japan that will colonize us and wage war. We demand world peace and national independence. Therefore, we demand a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and the withdrawal of the occupying forces.
    The declaration said: In this glorious struggle, our party convened the party's Fourth National Congress. The meeting discussed the party's various issues and reached a complete consensus. When discussing the domestic and international situation, the meeting firmly believed that as long as our actions are correct, our struggle for peace and independence will surely be victorious. The war and colonization policies implemented by reactionaries at home and abroad are contrary to the interests of the Japanese people, and therefore they cannot gain the support of the people. This policy is also contrary to the interests and wishes of the people all over the world. Our struggle for peace and independence, like the struggles of the people of Asian countries, is encouraged and supported by the strength of the people all over the world.
    The meeting resolved to overcome all obstacles and difficulties, to fight against a separate peace treaty that would cause war and enslave Japan, and to fight for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. In order to win victory in this struggle, the working class must develop the struggle of the entire people, strengthen self-defense organizations, and combine them with the struggle for a comprehensive peace treaty and the demand for the withdrawal of occupying forces. Without this organized force of the people, it is impossible to defeat the armed ambitions of the reactionary forces. The working class should play a leading role in carrying out the signature campaign for a comprehensive peace treaty and against the rearmament of Japan, and the broad masses of people from all walks of life will participate in this movement. This movement will arouse the patriotism of millions of people, mobilize the people to participate in the struggle for peace and independence, and expand and consolidate the democratic national united front headed by the working class.
    The meeting made a resolution on the organizational principles of the party and decided to consolidate the party with iron discipline in order to protect the masses of the people from being harmed by the fascist forces of reactionaries at home and abroad. The meeting also passed a new draft of the party constitution.
    The declaration finally emphasized: In order to win peace and achieve independence, we must go through an extremely arduous road. But this road is certain to achieve victory. Our party held this National Congress in order to further advance along this road to victory together with all patriotic compatriots. Our party and all its organizations guarantee to implement the various resolutions of the meeting. The declaration called on the Japanese people to fight together with the Japanese Communist Party for the glory and dignity of the motherland.

### 坚决反对使日本殖民地化的单独和约  日共号召人民争取缔结全面和约

　　坚决反对使日本殖民地化的单独和约
    日共号召人民争取缔结全面和约
    【新华社四月二十八日讯】东京消息：日本共产党曾于二月二十三日至二十七日举行第四次全国代表会议。会议闭幕时，日本共产党临时中央指导部向日本全国工人与全国人民发表了《为争取全面对日和约、要求全面和约缔结后撤退所有占领军，反对日本重新武装而斗争的宣言》。日本共产党刊物《党的活动指针》于三月二十一日登载了宣言的全文。
    宣言首先揭露了美帝国主义现在正在武装日本的陆、海、空军，建立军事基地，恢复军火生产，并驱使日本人参加侵朝战争。宣言指出：美日反动派重新武装日本的真正目的，是要利用日本的国土与人民在新的世界战争中反对苏联和中国。宣言说：日本国内外反动派在对朝鲜人民进行的干涉战争中失败之后，更明目张胆地更大规模地推行他们的野心勃勃的计划。他们准备利用西德和日本作为他们战争计划中的前进据点。如果我们不能挫败这个计划，我们将会被驱使去进行反对苏联和中国的战争，我们国家将会被逼着重犯从前在军阀领导下所犯的罪行。日本如果被利用为一个前进据点，它必然会陷于战争的苦难中。
    宣言继称：日本全体人民希望所有的外国军队撤出去，希望有自己的独立的政府、独立的经济和文化。日本今天受外国的统治，这是和它的民族尊严不相容的，而且这也是全国人民过着不堪忍受的困苦生活的主要原因。全体日本人民都指望着和约问题的解决，能恢复他们的民族尊严，使他们解脱这一切痛苦。
    宣言指出：杜勒斯和吉田已经说过，如果签订了单独对日和约，美国的金融巨头就会继续留在日本，日本的经济就会被美国金融巨头所控制，日本军事化的国土和人民就会被美国利用来达到它的军事目的。换句话说，美国使日本殖民地化和重新武装的政策，将进一步加深日本人民的痛苦。而且，缔结单独和约之后继续与苏联和中国保持敌对状态，以及日本为进攻苏联与中国而重新武装，将会引起全世界人民的焦虑与反对，将会使国内外反动派更加拼命冒险，而终于使日本成为第三次世界大战的导火线。如果走上了这条道路，我们的国土就会变成战场，我们的家园将被焚毁，妻子将失去丈夫，孩子将失去父母，我们民族将遭到极端悲惨的命运。美国空军在朝鲜实行的焦土战术告诉我们这样的命运也在等着日本。我们不愿自己的祖国和民族陷于毁灭。因此，我们反对使我们殖民地化与进行战争的单独对日和约。我们要求世界和平与民族独立。因此，我们要求全面对日和约与撤退占领军。
    宣言说：在这个光荣的斗争中，我们党召开了党的第四次代表会议。会上讨论了党的各项问题，并取得了完全一致的意见。会议在讨论国内外形势的时候，坚决相信只要我们的行动正确，我们争取和平与独立的斗争就一定可以胜利。国内外反动派所实行的战争与殖民地化的政策是违反日本人民的利益的，因此他们得不到人民的支持。这种政策也是违反全世界人民的利益和愿望的。我们争取和平与独立的斗争，正如亚洲各国人民的斗争一样，是受到全世界人民的力量的鼓舞与支持的。
    会议决议：要排除一切障碍与困难，为反对将引起战争并使日本受奴役的单独和约而斗争，为争取全面对日和约而斗争。为了在这个斗争中取得胜利，工人阶级必须发展全体人民的斗争，加强自卫的组织，并把它们与争取全面和约与要求撤退占领军的斗争结合起来。如果没有这种有组织的人民的力量，就不可能战胜反动势力的武装的野心。工人阶级应当在进行争取全面和约与反对重新武装日本的签名运动中起领导作用，广大的各阶层人民是会参加这个运动的。这个运动将激起千千万万人民的爱国心，动员人民来参加争取和平与独立的斗争，并扩大与巩固以工人阶级为首的民主民族战线。
    会议作出了关于党的组织原则的决议，决定以铁的纪律来巩固党，以便保卫人民群众不为国内外反动派的法西斯势力所残害。会议并通过了新的党章草案。
    宣言最后强调称：为了赢得和平，取得独立，我们必须经历一段极端艰苦的道路。但这条道路是一定能够取得胜利的。我们党举行这次全国代表会议，就是为了与一切爱国同胞一道进一步走向这条胜利的道路。我们党和它的全部组织，保证要实行会议的各项决议。宣言号召日本人民与日本共产党一起为祖国的光荣与尊严而斗争。
