Japanese experts in the capital have issued statements one after another, warmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's note to Soviet Ambassador Roshchin on the 22nd.

Zhou Gengsheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, said: "The people of the world, including the people of Japan, should understand that the opinions of the Chinese and Soviet governments on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty are completely consistent; the opinions of China and the Soviet Union not only meet the requirements of peace in the Far East, but are also beneficial to the people of Japan. The propositions of the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the Japanese peace treaty respect the rights and interests of all Allied nations participating in the war against Japan, while also taking into account the interests and demands of the Japanese people."

Luo Longji, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "The Soviet government, in addition to issuing a stern condemnation of the U.S.-submitted draft of the "Japanese Peace Treaty," also put forward specific opinions regarding the preparation of the Japanese peace treaty. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's note to the Soviet Ambassador fully expresses the position and attitude of all the people of China. I firmly believe that all the people of China will use all their strength to support Foreign Minister Zhou's note and use action to promote the realization of the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals."

Mei Ru'ao, former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, said: "These two great documents are like a demon-revealing mirror for the United States' conspiracy to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan. These two major documents from the Chinese and Soviet governments declare to the Japanese people and the people of the world how upright and just, how legitimate and reasonable, the positions and propositions of China and the Soviet Union regarding the Japanese peace treaty are! Our position and propositions are not only to safeguard the interests of China and the Soviet Union, but also to take care of the interests of all Allied countries and the Japanese people."

Wang Tieya, professor at Peking University, said: "Foreign Minister Zhou's note points out that the opinions of the Chinese and Soviet people are completely consistent. We must never allow the United States to exclude China and the Soviet Union from the preparations for the Japanese peace treaty. We must never allow the United States to unilaterally tear up international agreements between the Allied nations, and we must never allow the United States to revive Japanese militarism and use the Japanese people as a tool for aggression against Korea, China, and Asian countries. The Chinese people have always advocated the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable peace treaty with Japan, so that the Japanese people can obtain peace, democracy, and national independence. As Foreign Minister Zhou's note points out, such a Japan 'is an indispensable factor for peace in Asia and the world.'"

Meng Xianzhang, professor at Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "The Chinese people unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's note to the Soviet Ambassador supporting the Soviet government's just propositions regarding the Japanese peace treaty. China and the Soviet Union made the greatest contributions to Japan's surrender, and the history of American imperialism's conspiracy to exclude China and the Soviet Union and monopolize the Japanese peace treaty is a history of constant failure. If American imperialism dares to obliterate the pivotal position of China and the Soviet Union in the Japanese peace treaty and act recklessly, then China and the Soviet Union and the Japanese people will surely make it suffer an even more miserable and disgraceful defeat again."

### 首都日本问题专家纷纷发表谈话  拥护周外长的照会

　　首都日本问题专家纷纷发表谈话
    拥护周外长的照会
    【本报讯】在北京的日本问题专家纷纷发表谈话，热烈支持二十二日周外长致苏联大使罗申的照会。
    中国人民外交学会副会长周鲠生说：“全世界的人民，包括日本的人民在内，应当明白，中苏两国政府关于对日和约问题的意见是完全一致的；中苏两国的意见不但合于远东和平的要求，并且对于日本的人民也是有利的。中苏两国政府关于对日和约的主张，一方面尊重所有参加对日作战的盟国的权利和利益，同时亦照顾到日本人民的利益和要求。”
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员罗隆基说：“苏联政府对美国送去的《对日和约草案》，除加以词严义正的谴责外，并提出了关于准备对日和约的具体意见。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长致苏大使的照会完全表达了我中国全体人民的立场和态度。我坚决相信全中国人民必定用全力来拥护周外长的照会，并且用行动来促使苏联合理建议的实现。”
    前远东国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈说：“这两个伟大文件对于美国单独对日媾和的阴谋是一面照妖镜。中苏两国政府这两大文件向日本人民和全世界人民宣示中苏两国关于对日和约的立场和主张是何等的正大光明，是何等的合法合理！我们的立场和主张决不仅是维护中苏两国的利益，而且要照顾各同盟国和日本人民的利益。”
    北京大学教授王铁崖说：“周外长的照会指出，中苏两国人民的意见是完全一致的。我们绝不能让美国把中苏两国排斥于对日和约的准备工作之外。我们绝不能让美国一手撕毁盟国的国际协定，我们绝不能让美国复活日本军国主义，以日本人民为侵略朝鲜、中国和亚洲各国的工具。中国人民一贯主张从速缔结全面的、公平合理的对日和约，使日本人民获得和平、民主与国家独立。正如周外长的照会所指出，这样的日本‘是亚洲与世界和平所不可缺少的因素’。”
    辅仁大学教授孟宪章说：“对于我周外长照会苏联大使支持苏联政府对日和约的正义主张，中国人民是一致拥护的。日本投降，以中苏两国贡献为最大，过去美帝国主义阴谋排斥中苏两国、包办对日和约的历史，就是一部不断失败的历史。倘美帝国主义竟敢抹杀中苏两国在对日和约中举足轻重的地位而蛮干到底，则中苏两国与日本人民一定要使它再度遭到更惨的可耻的失败。”
