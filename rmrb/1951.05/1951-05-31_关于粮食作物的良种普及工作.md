　　On the Popularization of Improved Varieties of Grain Crops
    Grain Production Department, Central Ministry of Agriculture
    Editor's Note: To increase yield per unit area, it is essential to plant superior varieties. The creation of superior varieties requires a series of tasks, including seed selection, variety evaluation, and breeding. In this regard, the special districts of Handan in Hebei, Xinxiang in Pingyuan, and Wendeng in Shandong achieved excellent results last year. This article summarizes the experiences of 1950 and offers suggestions for the popularization of improved varieties in the future.
    The promotion of improved varieties and the seed selection campaign during the summer and autumn of 1950 were very successful. According to incomplete statistics, improved varieties were popularized on approximately 9 million mu nationwide, exceeding the original plan by 136%. The masses selected and exchanged about 300 million jin of seeds themselves, enough to sow 50 million mu. A total of 548 counties nationwide selected 1,681 superior varieties, among which the Manchurian Full Granary Golden Soybean selected in the Northeast, the 50 Wheat selected in Pingyuan Province, the Bima No. 1 Wheat selected in Shaanxi Province, and the Flat Spike Wheat selected in Shandong Province were the most outstanding. During seed selection, special attention was also paid to wheat varieties resistant to stripe rust. For example, Xinxiang Special District in Pingyuan selected eight wheat varieties that were both resistant to stripe rust and high-yielding. During the autumn seed selection campaign, 60% of households in Hebei Province were involved in seed selection. Newly liberated areas such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Southern Jiangsu, and Southern Anhui also widely organized seed selection work teams to mobilize the masses for seed selection in a focused manner. In areas where evaluation and selection were launched, the masses were generally organized to exchange seeds, implementing the principle of on-site evaluation and on-site promotion. The main experiences, lessons, and future suggestions are explained below:
    (1) Since the draft of the Five-Year Plan for the Popularization of Improved Varieties was issued, it has generally attracted the attention of leading cadres at all levels. The plan stipulates that a comparison campaign should be launched among the masses, with the county as the unit. Through the comparison campaign, not only can the best varieties be identified, but also the best farming techniques can be compared, closely integrating the seed selection campaign with farming and cultivation techniques. Experience has proven that carrying out a comparison campaign is the best way for the masses to teach and learn from each other, exchange experiences, improve scientific and technical levels, and launch a high-yield competition.
    (2) Over the past year, seed companies have purchased approximately 65 million jin of improved varieties. The purity of summer-harvested wheat seeds was above 85%, and the purity of autumn-harvested improved varieties increased to above 95%. However, because seed companies initially emphasized business operations, and because the tasks were large and the demands were urgent, they made the mistake of blindly purchasing, resulting in the phenomenon of "improved varieties that were not good." The purchase of improved varieties was not based on promotion plans and the needs of the masses. All the improved varieties planted by the masses were purchased in advance, and even the seeds selected and retained by the masses themselves were to be purchased. The work of removing impurities and inferior seeds was only carried out after purchase, causing losses and dissatisfaction among the masses. Some areas even collected seeds with serious diseases and insect pests. For example, Ding County in Hebei Province collected more than 400,000 jin of No. 72 wheat with nematode disease. These deviations have been basically corrected after the National Seed Conference. In the future, it is necessary to emphasize the establishment of a variety improvement and propagation promotion system to overcome the blind phenomenon in purchasing and promotion. A promotion network should be organized with the county farm as the center. Initially selected seeds in the county should be propagated in the original producing area of improved varieties, then propagated and demonstrated on seed retention land, and then promoted to the majority of farmers. After the final selection seeds are produced by the provincial farm, they should be propagated at the farm or in organized improved variety propagation areas, and then propagated in special and county farms, and comparative observation experiments should be conducted. Then, county farms should give a small amount of seeds to small farms for demonstration. After the demonstration is successful, the seeds should be taken to seed retention land for propagation, and then promoted to farmers.
    (3) Variety improvement is an effective measure to increase yield per unit area. In the past, all localities have made great achievements, but they still inevitably experience degradation and deterioration after promotion. In the future, the Five-Year Plan for the Popularization of Improved Varieties should be implemented, the masses should be mobilized to select and retain seeds themselves, the evaluation work should be completed, and a variety improvement and propagation promotion system should be established, linking mass seed selection with farm breeding to continuously improve and upgrade varieties. Carry out a mass seed improvement movement, including the three aspects of selection, evaluation, and breeding. Some places only emphasized mass seed selection without paying attention to evaluation. After the evaluation was completed, the masses were neither organized to exchange seeds, nor were the initially selected seeds sent to farms for variety comparison experiments. Some paid attention to evaluation, but neglected farm breeding work. In the future, the following points should be noted in the work:
    ① In the evaluation areas, the three aspects of selection, evaluation, and breeding must be fully combined.
    ② Village-level evaluations do not necessarily have to be carried out in every village. Selecting one village for evaluation within two or three villages with the same environment is also acceptable. For county-wide evaluations, at least half of the villages must participate in seed selection to ensure that the representation is relatively comprehensive. As for whether the county-level evaluation should be held once or twice a year, and whether it should be evaluated by districts and townships first, each county can decide on its own and report to the provincial people's government for approval. Those who cannot conduct two evaluations must make a summary after the wheat harvest and evaluate the main improved varieties within one month before wheat sowing to avoid delaying sowing.
    ③ Widely encourage farmers to establish small farms. Mobilize labor models and activists to select the best single ears in the large fields, harvest and plant them separately, conduct selection and breeding of superior varieties, and continuously participate in evaluations. This is a mass method of selecting and breeding superior varieties. This year, many places have created a lot of experience, and should continue to advocate and support it in the future.
    In addition to producing the final selection seeds on schedule, provincial farms should conduct selection and breeding work of superior varieties according to the needs of the province. Hybrid breeding must be carried out according to the needs of manpower and the conditions of selection materials. In the future, the focus of variety improvement should be on selecting and breeding high-yielding, rust-resistant wheat varieties for wheat, improving rice quality and selecting early-maturing, high-yielding wheat varieties for the south, producing more export soybeans for soybean producing areas, introducing superior winter wheat suitable for the local area for spring wheat areas, promoting mass emasculation and selection and promoting inter-variety hybridization for corn, and improving the quality of existing improved varieties for sweet potatoes.
    (4) In the process of popularizing improved varieties, it is necessary to strengthen disease-resistant seed selection and disease-resistant breeding, strictly inspect and accept seeds, and prevent the spread of diseases and insects. A superior variety must have three conditions: high yield, disease resistance, and good quality. Variety improvement is not only for increasing production, but also one of the fundamental ways to reduce or eliminate diseases and insect pests. In the past year, a lot of achievements have been made in this regard. For example, in areas with severe rust, many rust-resistant varieties have been selected. Pingyuan Province alone has selected 28 rust-resistant varieties, and Hebei Province has selected 19 rust-resistant varieties. In areas with severe wheat blossom midges, many wheat blossom midge-resistant varieties have also been selected and bred. Therefore, in the promotion of improved varieties, it is necessary to thoroughly sort out the existing superior varieties, strictly inspect and accept them, prohibit the promotion of seeds with diseases and insect pests, widely mobilize the masses to remove diseased plants, and educate farmers to strictly prohibit sowing with seeds with diseases and insects. At the same time, pay attention to the cleanliness of seeds, ensuring that there is no ash, soil, sand, weeds, or straw, to avoid carrying germs and insect eggs. Before sowing, combine with disease and insect prevention personnel to mobilize the masses to implement seed soaking, seed dressing, salt water selection, and mud water selection.
    In the seed selection work in various places, the achievements are great in places where leading cadres attach importance to it, fully mobilize the masses, and strengthen organizational leadership. Wherever the emphasis is solely on business operations, attempting to complete the task of popularizing improved varieties by means of large-scale purchasing and transfer, the effort is great but the results are small. On the basis of a small-scale agricultural economy, the popularization of improved varieties is basically a mass work. In the future, it is necessary to reorganize seed companies and strengthen the leadership of administrative departments at all levels over the cause of popularizing improved varieties. All localities should first do a good job of publicity and organization, run short-term training classes, and thoroughly implement the basic spirit of the Five-Year Plan for the Popularization of Improved Varieties among the masses. At the same time, mobilize the masses to carry out seed selection and comparison campaigns, and complete the evaluation and variety improvement work from the bottom up. Then, popularize the selected and bred superior varieties to the masses.

　　关于粮食作物的良种普及工作
    中央农业部粮食生产司
    编者按：为了提高单位面积产量，首先要种植优良品种。良种的产生，必须经过选种、评种、育种等一系列的工作。在这一方面，去年河北邯郸、平原新乡、山东文登等专区，曾有很好的成绩。本文是总结了一九五○年的经验后，对今后良种普及工作所提出的意见。
    一九五○年夏秋两季良种推广和选种运动的成绩是很大的，据不完全的统计，全国共推广良种约九百万亩，超过原计划百分之一百三十六。群众自行选种换种约三亿斤，可播种五千万亩。全国共计有五百四十八县，选出优良品种一千六百八十一种，其中如东北选出的满仓金大豆，平原省选出的五○小麦，陕西省选出碧码一号小麦，山东省选出扁穗麦等，都是最突出的优良品种。在选种时，还特别注意了小麦抗疸品种，如平原新乡专区即选出抗疸而丰产的小麦八种。在秋季选种运动中，河北省选种户已达百分之六十。新区如浙江、江西、苏南、皖南也普遍地组织选种工作队，有重点地发动群众选种。在发动评选的地区，均普遍地组织群众换种，执行了就地评选、就地推广的方针。兹将主要经验教训，及今后意见说明于后：
    （一）自五年良种普及计划草案发出后，普遍引起了各级领导干部的重视。计划中规定了要发动群众以县为单位开展评比运动。经过评比运动，不仅可以把最好的品种比出来，而且也可以把最好的耕作技术也比出来，使选种运动，和耕作及栽培技术密切结合。经验证明：开展评比运动是群众互教互学，交流经验，提高科学技术水平，发动丰产竞赛的最好办法。
    （二）一年来种子公司收购了良种约六千五百万斤，夏收麦种纯洁度在百分之八十五以上，秋收良种纯洁度提高到百分之九十五以上。但是由于种子公司开始成立时，特别强调了经营工作，同时又因任务大、要求快，因此就犯了盲目收购的错误，发生了《良种不良》的现象。收购良种不根据推广计划，和群众需要，把群众所种的良种，全部预购，甚至把群众自选自留的种子，都要收购起来，收购到那里，去杂去劣工作就作到那里，使群众遭到损失与不满。有的地区把带有严重病虫害的种子，也收起来了，如河北定县收下带有线虫病的七二号小麦四十多万斤。这些偏向，在全国种子会议后，基本上已经纠正了。今后必须强调建立品种改良及繁殖推广制度，以克服收购和推广中的盲目现象。以县农场为中心，组织推广网。本县初选种，应在良种原产地，先组织良种繁殖区繁殖，然后交留种地繁殖示范，再向广大农民推广。省农场的决选种产生后，一面在本场或组织良种繁殖区进行繁殖，一面在专、县农场繁殖，并进行观察比较试验，再由县农场，将少量种子交小农场去示范。待示范成功后，即将种子拿到留种地去繁殖，然后向农民推广。
    （三）品种改良为提高单位面积产量的有效措施。过去各地都已做出很大成绩，但仍不免在推广之后，发生退化变劣的现象。今后应贯彻五年良种普及计划，发动群众自行选种、留种，完成评选工作，建立品种改良及繁殖推广制度，把群众选种和农场育种连系起来，以达品种不断改良和提高的目的。开展群众性的种子改良运动，包括选、评、育三个内容，有些地方单强调了群众选种，而没有注意评选。有的评选完毕既没有组织群众换种，也没有把初选种送交农场进行品种比较试验。有的虽注意评选，但忽略了农场育种工作。今后在工作进行中，应注意以下几点：
    ①在评选地区必须把选、评、育三个内容完全结合。
    ②村级评选，不一定要村村都进行，在三两个同环境的村内，选一个村来进行也可以。全县评选，必须有半数以上的村选种参加，使其代表性能够比较全面。至于以县为单位的评选，是否须一年一次或一年两次，是否须经区乡评选，可由各县自行决定，报请省人民政府批准执行。不能进行两次评选者，必须在麦收后作出总结，把主要的优良品种，在小麦播种前一个月内评定出来，以免耽误播种。
    ③广泛地提倡农民建立小农场。发动劳动模范积极分子，在大田中选取最好的单穗，单收单种，进行选优育种，不断参加评选。这是一个群众性的选优育种方法。今年各地已创造了不少经验，今后应继续倡导扶植。
    各省农场，除如期产生决选种外，应根据本省需要，进行选优育种工作。杂交育种，必须根据人力需要及选择材料等条件来进行。今后品种改良的重点，小麦以选育丰产抗锈病品种为主，江南以改进水稻品质选育早熟丰产的麦种为主。大豆产区以多产出口大豆为主，春麦区以引种适合于当地的优良冬麦为主，玉米以提倡发动群众去雄选种，推行异品种间杂交为主，甘薯以改良现有良种的品质为主。
    （四）在良种普及过程中必须加强抗病选种及抗病育种工作，严格种子检查验收，预防病虫传播。一个优良品种必须具有丰产、抗病、质优三个条件。品种改良不仅是为了增产，同时也是从根本上减轻或消灭病虫害方法之一。一年来在这一方面已做出很多成绩。譬如在锈病严重的地区，评选出许多抗锈病品种，只平原省即选出二十八个抗锈品种，河北省评选出十九个抗锈病品种。在吸浆虫严重地区，也选育了不少抗吸浆虫的品种。因此，在良种推广方面，要彻底整理现有的优良品种，严格检查验收，禁止推广带有病虫害的种子，广泛发动群众拔除病株，并教育农民严格禁止用带有病虫的种子播种。同时要注意种子的清洁工作，作到无灰土泥沙，无杂草和藁杆，以免带有病菌、虫卵。在播种以前结合病虫防治人员发动群众施行浸种、拌种，盐水选种，泥水选种等处理。
    各地在选种工作中，凡是领导干部重视、充分发动群众、加强组织领导的，成绩就很大。凡是单纯强调经营，企图用大量收购调剂方式，完成良种普及任务的，费力大而收效小。在小农经济的基础上，良种普及基本上是个群众工作。今后必须改组种子公司，加强各级行政部门对良种普及事业的领导。各地首先应做好宣传组织工作，开办短期训练班，把五年良种普及计划的基本精神深入贯彻到群众中去，同时要发动群众开展选种及评比运动，自下而上地完成评选及品种改良工作。然后把选育出来的优良品种再普及到群众中去。
