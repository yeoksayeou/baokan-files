　　Unmanned Bookstore - Seen at Beijing Railway Station - (Sketches of the Capital, No. 6)
    Made by Shao Yu
    At the Beijing Railway Station, there is a small bookstore. In ten months, it sold 53,000 books and 13,308 newspapers, receiving 12.56 million yuan in Renminbi. It's not for making money, and it never loses money. But, there are only people buying books and no one selling them. It's an "unmanned bookstore."
     It's not surprising:
     Because labor, honesty, and wisdom have always been the morality and qualities of the people.
     Because our country has opened up a path of boundless glory for life!
    The rulers who created laziness, ignorance, and poverty through exploitation and deception have been overthrown. The spirit of labor, honesty, and learning is changing the character and face of society.
     Buy more new books at cost,
     Read them yourself,
     Educate the children,
     Get on the train
     And rush forward! (Attached picture)

　　无人售书处——北京车站所见——（首都速写之六）
    邵宇作
    北京站上有个小小的售书处，十个月卖了五万三千册书，一万三百零八份报纸，收款人民币一千二百五十六万元，不为赚钱，也从没赔钱；但是，那里只有买书的人却没有卖书的人，那是个“无人售书处”。
     说来并不奇怪：
     因为劳动、诚实和智慧，向来就是人民的道德和品质。
     因为我们的国家给生活开辟了限光辉的道路！
    用剥削、欺骗制造懒惰、愚昧、贫困的统治者被打倒了，劳动、诚实和学习的精神，在改变着社会的性格和面貌。
     多买成本新书，
     自己看，
     教育孩子们，
     坐上列车
     向前奔驰吧！（附图片）
