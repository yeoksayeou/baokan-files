Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League , the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation issued a joint statement on May 28 in support of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The full text of the statement:
    The agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet has been signed. All of us, the people of China, cheer for this great happy event and for the smashing of the imperialists' conspiracy of aggression once again.

    We fully support the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Because it enables the people of the Tibetan nationality to get rid of the oppression and enslavement of the imperialists from now on, to return to the friendly and united family of all ethnic groups in China, and it enables the people of the Tibetan nationality to unite closely with all the Chinese people under the great banner of patriotism from now on, and to march towards a bright and happy future.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in China are united as never before, and the strength of the Chinese people is stronger than ever before. The imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the peaceful liberation of Tibet has once again gone bankrupt. Here, we once again warn the imperialists that if anyone dares to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the people of all ethnic groups in China will continue to make them suffer even more shameful defeats.

    [This newspaper reports] People's organizations such as the North China Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the North China Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions have expressed their support for the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The North China Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea believes that the signing of this agreement is an unprecedented happy event for the Tibetan people and a great happy event for all the Chinese people. This victory was achieved under the call of Chairman Mao and the correct ethnic policy of the Central People's Government. We must further develop the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in order to liberate Taiwan and drive the American aggressors out of Korea.

    The North China Working Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, on behalf of the youth of North China and one million Youth League members, expressed their wholehearted support and will fully support the implementation of the agreement.

    A spokesperson for the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions issued a written statement stating that the city's workers unanimously support and celebrate the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and called on the city's workers to promptly check their fulfillment of the patriotic pact in order to celebrate the great unity of all ethnic groups in China with practical actions.

    More than 200 representatives from all industries in Beijing's business community held a celebration meeting on the 28th and resolved to intensify their efforts in the country's economic construction to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and liberate Taiwan.
