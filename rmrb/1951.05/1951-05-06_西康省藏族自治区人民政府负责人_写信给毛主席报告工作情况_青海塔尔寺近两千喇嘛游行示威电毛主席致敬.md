Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, 3rd. Sangji Yexi, Chairman of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, Riku Living Buddha, a government member, and 35 others, together with all the Tibetan people of the region, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the "May Day" holiday, reporting on the work of the region and expressing their support for the Central People's Government's policy of peaceful liberation of Tibet. The letter said: Respected Chairman Mao: Your name has resonated in every corner of the Tibetan region. We are far away in the western border of the motherland, and in the past we were discriminated against and oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, under your nurturing, we have become the masters of the great motherland. Four of our Tibetan people have been appointed as chairman and vice-chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and twenty-two have become government members. Under the cultivation of the Communist Party and the People's Government, 1,607 Tibetan cadres are working in governments at all levels, and a local armed force truly belonging to the Tibetan people has been established to maintain and consolidate the public security of the entire region. This kind of improvement in political status is something we never dreamed of in the past. Our economic life is also gradually improving with the help of the People's Government. In the past nine months, the total value of local products purchased by the People's Government in the Tibetan region reached 9.7 billion yuan, and the local products that had been unsalable for 30 years have found a market. Thanks to the help of the epidemic prevention team sent by the People's Government, the death of our livestock has been reduced, and they are gradually breeding prosperously. Now, the spring sowing has been completed in most parts of the region, and the farmers are working on production with peace of mind. Under the call of your great national policy, the unity within our nation and between nations has been increasingly strengthened and consolidated. Chairman Mao! Your grace is higher than the mountains, deeper than the ocean, and more numerous than the stars. We are infinitely grateful. At present, we are involved in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. We assure you that we will take practical actions to deepen this patriotic movement, and we will never allow the great motherland to be invaded by imperialism again. Chairman Mao, we are eager for the compatriots in Tibet to be liberated soon. We support the call of the Central People's Government for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, so that the Tibetan compatriots can return to the big family of the motherland as soon as possible, and work together with us to build a new Kangzang. Chairman Mao, may your glory always shine on us. We wish you a long life!
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 3rd. Nearly 2,000 lamas from Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai Province enthusiastically participated in the demonstration parade held in Lusha'er Town, Huangzhong County, to celebrate the "May Day" Labor Day. On the morning of May 1st, the lamas wearing purple kasayas, together with people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, held high the flags of "Resolutely Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Oppose US Imperialism Arming Japan" and the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and participated in the local parade. Bai Fo Xiarong Gabu, the Dharma Throne of the monastery, spoke at a mass rally of more than 20,000 people in the area. He called on all lamas to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, unite closely with people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life, actively carry out the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, resolutely oppose US imperialism rearming Japan, and support the conclusion of a peace treaty. Dan Zhi Lama, on behalf of all the monks of the monastery, read out the five patriotic conventions of all the monks of Ta'er Monastery to the conference, and presented a silk banner and 4.3 million yuan in RMB to the Chinese and Korean People's Forces on the spot. After the meeting, all the lamas of the monastery gathered in front of the main scripture hall of the monastery to sign in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty and to vote on the Japanese issue. 1,699 lamas participated in the signing and voting. The conference also passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The telegram stated:
    As all the monks of our Ta'er Monastery are holding a "May Day" patriotic demonstration parade, we received the news that the Panchen Lama and the representatives of the local government of Tibet have arrived in Beijing, and we are particularly excited about this. Our People's Republic of China has only been established for more than a year, and all aspects of the country have made unprecedented progress. Tibet, the last piece of land on the Chinese mainland, is also about to return to the embrace of the great motherland of all ethnic people. We celebrate that all Lamaist believers in the country will gain the happy life of national equality and freedom of religious belief. All the lamas of our Ta'er Monastery are really very happy. Since Dharma Throne Xiarong Gabu returned from Beijing and conveyed your concern and instructions to us, we have all received great education and encouragement. We would like to assure you that we will definitely actively participate in the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the construction of the new China in the future.

    青海塔尔寺近两千喇嘛游行示威电毛主席致敬
    【新华社雅安三日电】西康省藏族自治区人民政府主席桑吉悦希、政府委员日库活佛等三十五人暨该区全体藏民于“五一”节写信给毛主席，报告该区工作情况，并表示拥护中央人民政府和平解放西藏的政策。信里说：敬爱的毛主席：你的名字已响彻藏区每一角落。我们远处祖国西陲，过去被国民党反动派歧视压迫，今天在你的抚育下，已经成为伟大祖国的主人。我们藏族人民中已有四人担任了自治区人民政府的主席和副主席，二十二人作了政府委员，在共产党和人民政府的培育下，已有一千六百零七个藏族干部在各级政府中工作，并建立了一支真正属于藏族人民的地方武装，维持和巩固着全区的治安。这种政治地位的提高是我们过去做梦也想不到的。我们的经济生活也在人民政府的帮助下，逐步改善。九个月来，人民政府在藏区收购的土产总值达人民币九十七亿元，三十年来滞销的土产已有了销路。由于人民政府所派出的防疫队的帮助，我们的牲畜减少了死亡，并逐渐繁殖旺盛。现在全区绝大部分地方已经春播完毕，农民正在安心生产。在你伟大的民族政策感召下，我们民族内部和民族之间的团结已日益加强和巩固。毛主席！你的恩惠比山峰还高，比海洋还深，比天星还多，我们感激不尽。目前我们正卷入抗美援朝运动中，我们向你保证，要以实际行动来深入这个爱国运动，我们绝不容许伟大的祖国再被帝国主义侵略。毛主席，我们渴望着西藏地方的同胞能够早日解放，我们拥护中央人民政府和平解放西藏的号召，使西藏同胞早日回到祖国的大家庭来，和我们携手并肩努力建设新康藏。毛主席，愿你的光辉永远照耀着我们。祝你万寿无疆！
    【新华社西宁三日电】青海省塔尔寺全寺近两千名喇嘛，热烈参加湟中县鲁沙尔镇举行的庆祝“五一”劳动节示威游行大会。五月一日的清晨，穿着紫色袈裟的喇嘛们同各族各界人民一起，高举着“坚决抗美援朝、反对美帝武装日本”的旗帜和毛主席、朱总司令的画像，参加了当地游行的行列。该寺法台白佛夏茸尕布在该地两万多人的群众大会上讲话。他号召全体喇嘛发扬爱国主义的精神，和各族各界人民亲密团结，积极开展抗美援朝爱国主义运动，坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，拥护缔结和平公约。旦纸喇嘛代表全寺僧众，向大会宣读了塔尔寺全体僧众五项爱国公约，并当场给中朝人民部队献赠锦旗一面和人民币四百三十万元。会后全寺喇嘛齐集该寺大经堂前举行拥护缔结和平公约的签名和对日本问题的投票。参加签名和投票的有一千六百九十九名喇嘛。大会并通过向毛主席致敬的电文。电文称：
    当我们塔尔寺全体僧众正举行“五一”爱国游行大示威的时候，传来了班禅大师和西藏地方当局谈判代表到达北京的消息，我们对此感到特别的兴奋。我中华人民共和国仅成立一年多，全国各方面均得到空前未有的进步，而中国大陆最后一块国土——西藏，也快要回到各民族人民伟大祖国的怀抱里。我们欢庆全国喇嘛教徒都将获得民族平等和信教自由的幸福生活。我们塔尔寺全体喇嘛真是高兴极了，自从夏茸尕布法台从北京回来，传达了您对我们的关怀和指示后，我们都受到很大的教育和鼓励。我们愿向您保证：今后一定积极参加抗美援朝的爱国主义运动和新中国的建设事业。
