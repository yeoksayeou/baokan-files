The implementation of labor insurance in Tianjin's cotton textile factories has greatly reduced the mortality rate of workers and increased their enthusiasm for labor. This proves the great role of labor insurance in developing production. However, at the same time, some factories have experienced an increase in absenteeism, which is not a good phenomenon. It is hoped that trade union workers in various regions will pay attention to this issue in the following two aspects:

First, after implementing labor insurance, it is necessary to first conduct in-depth ideological education. The reason why a small number of workers in Tianjin's cotton textile factories feign illness and ask for leave after the implementation of labor insurance is precisely because they do not have a correct understanding of the labor insurance regulations. If the trade union and relevant parties can educate everyone well, so that everyone can clearly understand that the labor insurance regulations are the victorious fruit of the Chinese working class's decades of bloody sacrifice and arduous struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they will definitely take more active actions to defend it, and the idea of "getting paid even when not working" will not occur.

Second, after implementing labor insurance, it is not only necessary to provide care for employees in cases of birth, old age, illness, death, disability, and injury, but more importantly, to actively adopt various measures in peacetime to strengthen labor protection work, improve working conditions, and improve sanitation facilities, in order to fight for reducing the incidence of illness and injury among employees. After the implementation of labor insurance in Tianjin's cotton textile factories, many workers are still absent due to illness, and most of these diseases can be prevented and avoided. This shows that the trade unions in various factories only pay attention to treatment and care after the occurrence of diseases, and do not carry out prevention beforehand. Trade union workers in various regions should learn from this lesson, deeply understand the production and living conditions of workers, conduct health education for everyone in a timely manner, assist and urge the administrative departments to do a good job in labor protection, and reduce employee illnesses. In this way, not only can the health of the workers be protected and the expenditure of labor insurance funds be reduced, but it is also beneficial to production.

### 实行劳动保险后如何减低缺勤率

　　实行劳动保险后如何减低缺勤率
    天津各棉纺织工厂实行劳动保险后，职工死亡率大减，劳动热情增高，这证明了实行劳动保险对发展生产的巨大作用。但是，同时有些厂却发生了缺勤率增高的现象，这种现象是不好的。希望各地工会工作者从下述两方面注意这个问题：
    一、实行劳动保险，必须首先深入地进行思想教育。天津棉纺织工厂少数工友在实行劳动保险后装病请假，正是因为他们对劳动保险条例没有正确的认识。假使工会及有关方面能够很好的教育大家，使大家都能明白地认识到，劳动保险条例是中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下数十年流血牺牲艰苦奋斗的胜利果实，他们就一定会以更积极的行动来保卫它，“歇工也给钱”的思想也就不会发生。
    二、实行了劳动保险，不但要在职工生、老、病、死、残、伤后予以照顾，更重要的是在平时积极采取各种办法加强劳动保护工作，改善劳动条件，改进卫生设备，为减低职工的病伤率而斗争。天津各棉纺织工厂实行劳动保险后，因疾病缺勤的工人仍然很多，而这些疾病又大多是可以预防和避免的，这说明各厂工会只注意在疾病发生后的治疗照顾，而没有事先进行防预。各地工会工作者应该接受这一教训，深入了解工人的生产和生活状况，及时对大家进行卫生教育，协助并督促行政方面做好劳动保护工作，减少职工疾病。这样，不但可以保护工友们的身体健康，减少劳动保险经费的开支，同时对于生产也是有利的。
