　　The Chinese New Democratic Youth League is the inheritor of the Chinese youth's revolutionary struggle tradition
    ——Commemorating Chinese Youth Day and the second anniversary of the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League
    Feng Wenbin

    I.

    Thirty-two years ago, on May Fourth, revolutionary student youth in China launched an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement starting in Beijing. This was "the starting point of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution." From the May Fourth Movement, Chinese revolutionary intellectuals began to embark on the Marxist-Leninist path of integrating with workers and peasants. In 1920, the first revolutionary youth organization in China, the Socialist Youth League, was founded. Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi all participated in this league.

    II.

    From 1920 to 1925, the Socialist Youth League and later the Communist Youth League bravely participated in China's famous "May 30th" anti-imperialist movement, the Northern Expedition, and the ten-year land revolution struggle. It mobilized tens of thousands of young people to join the Red Army. At that time, entire league branches and district committees joined the Red Army, and the "Young Communist International Regiment" and "Young Communist International Division," named after the Young Communist International, were established. The Young Pioneers (a mass youth semi-armed organization) and Children's Corps were organized to cooperate and support the front lines. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the Youth League, under the leadership of the Communist Party, persisted in underground struggles, preparing and launching the great "December 9th Movement" of anti-Japanese national salvation in 1935.

    From 1936 to 1945, in order to adapt to the international and domestic political situation at the time, to organize a broad united front of youth against Japanese aggression, and to transform the work style of the Youth League itself, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to transform the organization of the Communist Youth League into a broad national liberation organization. Subsequently, organizations such as the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard, the Youth National Salvation Corps, the Youth National Salvation Association, and the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard were established. In the anti-Japanese base areas, the Youth National Salvation Association and the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard developed to over one million members. These youth organizations mobilized a vast number of young people to join the Eighth Route Army and guerrilla forces, consolidate the rear, engage in production, and carry out rural cultural work, making very significant contributions. Many outstanding young people sacrificed their young lives in battle for the liberation of the motherland.

    In the context of the victorious development of the national revolution, the political consciousness of the vast number of young people rapidly increased, and they urgently demanded a unified national organization that included advanced young activists. Therefore, in October 1946, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a proposal to the entire party to trial-establish a Youth League. After two years of trial establishment in various places, the formal resolution to establish the Chinese New Democratic Youth League was issued on New Year's Day 1949. In April of the same year, the First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League was held in Beijing, and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League was officially declared established. It accepted the political report made by Comrade Ren Bishi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and adopted the League's Program and Constitution.

    The establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League is the result of thirty years of heroic struggle by Chinese youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It is the inheritor of the glorious revolutionary struggle tradition of Chinese youth. Its sole organizer and leader is the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, May Fourth was also designated as the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    III.

    Since its establishment, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has unremittingly carried out the glorious tasks entrusted to it by the Party. In the political, economic, military, and cultural construction undertakings of the New China, and in the struggles against the US aggression and aid Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, it has become a powerful and close assistant to the Party and the People's Government. Since American imperialism launched its criminal war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people, in order to defend peace and defend the motherland, have carried out a vigorous patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Youth League members are active participants in this movement.

    In the industrial production sector, Youth League members work with a high degree of consciousness and a sense of ownership. Countless Youth League members have become labor heroes and models for creating new records. Zhao Guoyou, a Youth League member from the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory, pioneered the new record movement. Since the nationwide patriotic production competition launched in October last year, Youth League members have participated with great enthusiasm. In the Northeast alone, 200,000 young people and Youth League members participated in the patriotic production competition in January of this year. The 61 Youth League members of the Shenyang No. 3 Nail Factory launched a patriotic production movement within the factory to do one more thing each. As a result, in January, the factory's workers did 751 more things, saving 1,434 man-hours. Yang Youde, a Youth League member from the Shenyang No. 4 Machine Factory, improved technology and increased production by 21 times. The working class is not only working hard to produce but also striving to improve their culture. Factory Youth League members are the most active in learning culture. Liu Meilan, a female Youth League member from the Dalian Metrology Factory, is an example of how she improved from being illiterate to knowing more than 3,000 characters and being able to write reports and articles in two years.

    In the rural patriotic production movement (in the old areas of Northeast and North China, it is the patriotic bumper harvest movement), Youth League members are an active and powerful shock force. Youth League members not only actively participate in agricultural production themselves, but also actively publicize the agricultural policies of the People's Government and take the lead in organizing mutual aid teams and promoting new farming methods. Many female Youth League members personally go to the fields to produce, breaking the old habit of women not participating in major labor in the fields. For example, Guo Yulan, a female Youth League member from Heilongjiang Province, and Wang Qingmei, a female Youth League member from Hebei Province, have become agricultural labor models. They also promoted new farming methods such as seed selection and seed soaking, and their harvests were greater than those of ordinary farmers. In the Huai River harnessing project, Youth League members on both sides of the Huai River united a large number of young people to participate. Last winter, in northern Anhui alone, one-third of the 600,000 laborers were young people, including 16,000 Youth League members. Youth League members became the backbone of the laborers. Thirty percent of the meritorious models in a county in Fuyang were Youth League members.

    In areas liberated later, rural Youth League members actively participated in various social reform movements such as land reform, rent reduction, anti-hegemony, and bandit suppression.

    As for educated youth, since the liberation of mainland China, they have worked hard to learn from workers and peasants and transform themselves. Youth League members are the most enthusiastic members of this study and transformation movement. Many of them have achieved great results. For example, Ding Youjun, a female Youth League member from Xikang, and Zhang Qunpeng, a Youth League member from Yunnan, were captured by special agents and bandits while working in the countryside, persisted in their integrity, and heroically sacrificed themselves. They are exemplary examples. In the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, many educated youth responded to the call of the motherland and participated in military cadre schools and joined the Volunteer Army. In the recent popularization of the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, students in various places generally used their spring break to go to the countryside to carry out propaganda and help everyone in the country receive education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Inside the schools, we are implementing patriotism into various courses. Students have clarified the idea of studying for the motherland and have become very enthusiastic about learning. Many students personally overcame difficulties and created learning conditions, manufacturing a large number of instruments, charts, and specimens themselves, and building school buildings and establishing laboratories and botanical and zoological gardens themselves.

    In the People's Liberation Army, 70 to 80 percent are young people. There are tens of thousands of model sharpshooters, model artillerymen, tank drivers, explosion heroes, and combat heroes who are Youth League members and young people. Of the 350 combat heroes who attended the National Conference of Combat Heroes held on September 25 last year, more than half were young people. In the movement to respond to the call of the People's Government to participate in military cadre schools this spring, Youth League members in various places rushed to the front and played a leading role. Many of the heroes in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are also Youth League members and young people. For example, Teng Kai, a Youth League member who sacrificed himself to blow up a bridge, and Ma Jiashun, a Youth League member who held the last position on Wenheng Mountain and died with the enemy with hand grenades, are the most outstanding heroes among Chinese youth. They defend the motherland and world peace with their blood.

    In terms of the League's publicity and education, there are a total of 49 types of internal publications for Youth League cadres across the country. There are 61 newspapers and magazines of the Youth League across the country. Since its establishment last year, the Youth Publishing House of the Central Committee of the Youth League has published a total of 216 kinds of series and magazines in 14 categories, with 8.8 million copies printed. The central organ of the Youth League, the "China Youth Daily," decided to launch on April 27 this year. The central organ of the Youth League, the bi-weekly "China Youth," is one of the most widely circulated magazines in the country. The Youth League has also established lectures in various cities, and recently, it has also established a system of learning counselors in some places, with learning counselors giving basic knowledge of the League and elementary political common sense to League members and young people. Outstanding League members have also been sent to participate in the Party's publicity network, serving as propagandists, publicizing current events, policies, and advanced production experiences.

    The ongoing movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and defend the country is the main struggle task of all Chinese people, and it is also the main struggle task of the Youth League. Every League member and every young person must be mobilized to fight for the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

    The Chinese New Democratic Youth League has achieved such results in the two years since its establishment under the leadership of the Party. We must achieve greater and more results, and we will become more consolidated and stronger. We will further play our role in China's revolutionary cause. We must further strengthen the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought education of Youth League members, strengthen the construction of the League, and resolutely fight for the thorough realization of the New Democracy.

　　中国新民主主义青年团是中国青年革命斗争传统的继承者
    ——纪念中国青年节和中国新民主主义青年团成立两周年
    冯文彬
    一
    三十二年前的五月四日，中国革命学生青年，从北京开始爆发了反帝反封建的革命运动，这是“中国新民主主义革命的起点”。从“五四”运动开始，中国革命知识分子开始走上了与工农结合的马克思列宁主义的道路。一九二○年，在中国产生了第一个革命青年的组织——社会主义青年团。毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、任弼时同志都曾经参加过这个团。
  二
    从一九二○年到一九二五年的社会主义青年团，及其以后的共产主义青年团，都英勇地参加了中国有名的“五卅”反帝运动、北伐战争、以及十年土地革命斗争。动员了成千成万青年参加红军。那时曾有整个团的支部、区委参加了红军，还建立了以少共国际命名的“少共国际团”和“少共国际师”。组织了少年先锋队（群众性的青年的半武装组织）和儿童团，配合支援前线的工作。在国民党统治区，青年团在共产党的领导下，坚持了地下斗争，准备和发动了一九三五年伟大的抗日救国的“一二九运动”。
    从一九三六年到一九四五年，为了适应当时国际国内的政治形势，为了组织广泛的青年抗日民族统一战线和改造青年团本身工作的作风，中国共产党中央决定改造共产主义青年团的组织，转变为广泛的民族解放性质的组织。接着建立了中华民族解放先锋队、青年救国团、青年救国会、青年抗日先锋队等组织，在抗日根据地的青年救国会、青年抗日先锋队发展到百余万人。这些青年组织动员了广大青年参加八路军和游击队，并巩固后方、进行生产、开展农村文化工作，有很重大的贡献。多少优秀青年，为了争取祖国的解放，在战斗中献出了自己年青的生命。
    在全国革命胜利发展的形势下，广大青年政治觉悟迅速提高，迫切要求有一个统一的全国性的包括先进青年的积极分子的组织。于是中国共产党中央于一九四六年十月向全党发出试建青年团的提议，经过两年在各地的试建以后，一九四九年元旦发出建立中国新民主主义青年团的正式决议。同年四月，在北京召开中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会，中国新民主主义青年团即正式宣告成立，接受了任弼时同志代表中国共产党中央所做的政治报告，通过了团纲、团章。
    中国新民主主义青年团的建立，是中国青年在中国共产党领导下，三十年来英勇斗争的成果。它是中国青年光荣革命斗争传统的继承者。它的唯一的组织者和领导者是中国共产党。因此，又规定五月四日是中国新民主主义青年团的成立纪念日。
  三
    中国新民主主义青年团成立后，始终不懈地执行着党所给予的光荣任务。在新中国的政治、经济、军事、文化各种建设事业中，在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命等斗争中，成为党和人民政府有力的、亲密的助手。自从美帝国主义发动了罪恶的侵朝战争，中国人民为了保卫和平，保卫祖国，进行了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝爱国运动。青年团员是这个运动积极的参加者。
    在工业生产部门，青年团员以高度的自觉性与主人翁的态度劳动着。无数青年团员成为劳动英雄和创造新纪录的模范。沈阳第三机械厂的青年团员赵国有，首创新纪录运动。从去年十月起发动的普遍全国的爱国生产竞赛，青年团员更抱着巨大的热情去参加。东北一地在今年一月即有二十万青年和青年团员参加爱国生产竞赛。沈阳制钉三厂共六十一名团员在厂内发动了每人多作一件事的抗美爱国生产运动。于是，在一月中，全厂工人多作了七百五十一件事，节省了一千四百三十四个工时。沈阳第四机器厂团员杨有德，改进技术，使产量提高了二十一倍。工人阶级不仅努力生产，而且努力提高自己的文化。工厂团员是学习文化最积极的分子。大连度量衡工厂女团员刘梅兰，在二年之内从一字不识提高到识了三千多字，能提笔写报告写文章。就是一个范例。
    在农村的爱国生产运动（在东北、华北老区是爱国丰产运动）中，青年团员是一支活跃的有力突击队。团员不仅自己积极参加农业生产，同时积极宣传人民政府农业政策，带头组织变工互助、推行新农作法。许多女团员亲自下地生产劳动，打破了妇女不下地参加主要劳动的旧习。例如黑龙江省女团员郭玉兰、河北省女团员王青梅都成了农业劳动模范。他们并推广选种、浸种等新的农作法，她们的收成比一般农民还多。在治理淮河工程中，淮河两岸的青年团员团结大批青年参加。去年冬天单皖北一个地方，六十万民工中有三分之一是青年，其中团员有一万六千人。团员成为民工中的骨干。阜阳一个县的功臣模范中有百分之三十是团员。
    解放较迟的地区，农村青年团员更积极参加了土地改革、减租、反霸、剿匪等各种社会改革运动。
    在知识青年方面，他们自从中国大陆解放以来，努力向工农学习，改造自己。团员是这个学习改造运动中最热情的分子。他们中间很多人是很有成绩的。例如西康的一个女团员丁佑君及云南的一个团员张群鹏在乡下工作时，被特务土匪俘掳，坚持气节，英勇牺牲，就是模范的例子。在抗美援朝爱国运动中，许多知识青年响应祖国号召，参加军事干部学校、参加志愿军。在最近普及抗美援朝爱国运动中，各地学生普遍利用春假下乡宣传，帮助全国每一个人都受到抗美援朝教育。在学校里面，我们正在把爱国主义贯彻到各种课程中去。学生们明确了为祖国学习的思想，便对学习发生很大的热情。许多学生亲自动手克服困难，创造学习条件，自己制造大批仪器、图表、标本，自己修建校舍，建立了实验室、动植物园。
    在人民解放军中，有百分之七十到百分之八十是青年。有成千成万的模范射击手、模范炮手、坦克手、爆炸英雄和战斗英雄，是青年团员和青年。去年九月二十五日召开的全国战斗英雄代表会议的三百五十名战斗英雄中，青年占一半以上。今年春季响应人民政府号召参加军事干部学校的运动中，各地青年团员争先恐后，起了带头作用。中国人民志愿军中的英雄们，很多也都是青年团员和青年。例如舍身炸大桥的青年团员滕凯，坚守文衡山最后以手榴弹与敌人同归于尽的青年团员马家顺等，都是中国青年中最优秀的英雄人物。他们以自己的鲜血，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。
    在团的宣传教育方面，全国青年团的干部阅读的团内刊物共有四十九种。全国青年团的报纸杂志有六十一种。团中央青年出版社自去年成立以来，共出版丛书、杂志十四类二百十六种。印行八百八十万册。青年团中央机关报——《中国青年报》决定在今年四月二十七日创刊。团中央机关刊物——《中国青年》双周刊，是全国销行最广的杂志之一。青年团并在各城市设立讲座，最近又在一些地方有重点地建立了学习辅导员制度，由学习辅导员在团员和青年中讲团的基本知识，和初级的政治常识。并派了优秀团员，参加了党的宣传网，担任宣传员；宣传时事、政策和先进生产经验等。
    现在正在胜利进行的抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动，是全中国人民当前主要的斗争任务，也就是青年团当前主要的斗争任务。必须发动每一个团员和每一个青年，为抗美援朝爱国运动而斗争。
    中国新民主主义青年团建立两年，在党的领导下已经得到了这样的成绩，我们一定还要取得更大更多的成绩，还会更加巩固强大。在中国的革命事业中更进一步发挥作用。我们必须更进一步加强青年团员的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育，加强团的建设，坚决为新民主主义的彻底实现而斗争。
