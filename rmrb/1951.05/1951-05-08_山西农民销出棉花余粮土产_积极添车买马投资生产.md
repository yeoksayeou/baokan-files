As cotton, surplus grain, and local products sell well, farmers in Shanxi Province are actively investing in production. According to statistics from 1,159 villages in the Changzhi and Linfen Special Districts (mainly the Changzhi Special District): farmers used the income from last year's sales of local products to purchase 231,854 pieces of farm equipment, an average increase of about 200 pieces per village, with waterwheels and large carts being the most numerous. Farmers in Xiangyuan and other two counties have added 63 new-style agricultural implements such as liberation plows, sprayers, and corn threshers this year. The increase in livestock in rural areas everywhere has also exceeded any previous year. According to a survey of 731 villages in the Changzhi and Linfen Special Districts, a total of 2,168 head of livestock have been added this year. Farmers in Dongchuan and Xichuan villages in Qinshui County have added 20 more draught horses this year because of the large output and good sales of hemp bark last year. The phenomenon of selling bad livestock and buying good livestock is also very common. A total of 1,038 head of livestock were exchanged in 179 villages in Wuxiang and Yicheng counties. In many places, farmers have also used the income from selling agricultural and local products to convert dry land into paddy fields, and have applied large amounts of fertilizer to improve farming techniques. Farmers in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province sold a large amount of cotton to the state last year according to reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, and their income has increased greatly. This year, their enthusiasm for planting cotton is very high, and they have expanded the cotton planting area by 30 percent.

　　山西农民销出棉花余粮土产
    积极添车买马投资生产
    由于棉花、余粮和土产畅销，山西省农民正在积极投资生产。据长治、临汾两专区（主要是长治专区）一千一百五十九个村的统计：农民用去年销售土产所得，购买了二十三万一千八百五十四件农具，平均每村增加二百件左右，其中尤以水车、大车等为最多。襄垣等两县农民今年增置了解放犁、喷雾器、玉米脱粒机等新式农具六十三件。各地农村中牲畜的增加也超过过去任何一年。据长治、临汾等专区七百三十一个村的调查，今年共增加牲畜二千一百六十八头。沁水县东、西川两村农民由于去年麻皮产量多、销路畅，今年便增置了耕马二十匹。把坏牲口卖掉而买进好牲口的现象也很普遍。武乡和翼城两县的一百七十九个村就共调换牲口一千零三十八头。很多地方的农民还把销出农产品和土产所得的收入用来改旱地为水田，并且大量施用肥料，改良耕作技术。山西省南部棉产区农民因去年按照合理的棉、粮比价向国家售出了大量棉花，收入大增，今年植棉情绪很高，已把植棉面积扩大了百分之三十。
