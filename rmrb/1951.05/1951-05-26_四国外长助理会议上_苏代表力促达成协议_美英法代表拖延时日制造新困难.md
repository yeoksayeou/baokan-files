Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 21st: The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers meeting continued from the 14th to the 19th.

　　At the meetings from the 14th to the 16th, the U.S., British and French representatives stubbornly opposed the new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on the 10th to strive for an agreement. They could not find any strong arguments to justify their position. When it was their turn to speak at the meeting on the 15th, none of them was willing to speak, and as a result, the meeting adjourned after two minutes.

　　At the meeting on the 17th, the Soviet delegation put forward a new proposal, expressing agreement with the suggestions of the three representatives, not to decide on the status of the issue of eliminating German militarism on the agenda, but to submit it to the Foreign Ministers' meeting for consideration. When proposing this new suggestion, the Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet Union has always insisted on placing the issue of eliminating German militarism in the first place on the agenda to match its importance. The Soviet delegation agreed to the suggestions of the three countries only because it wished to reach an agreement on the agenda.

　　Even most of the bourgeois newspapers in Paris had to admit that the Soviet delegation had made great efforts to enable the meeting to complete its task.

　　However, under the policy of obstructing agreement and delaying the meeting, the U.S., British and French representatives continued to create new difficulties at the meetings on the 18th and 19th. They also attempted to treat the wording of the issue of eliminating German militarism, on which agreement had already been reached, as an unresolved part of the agenda. They continued to oppose including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the issue of American military bases proposed by the Soviet Union as unresolved issues on the agenda.

　　四国外长助理会议上
    苏代表力促达成协议
    美英法代表拖延时日制造新困难
    【新华社二十一日讯】巴黎消息：四国外长助理会议于十四日至十九日继续举行。
    在十四日至十六日会议上，美、英、法三国代表仍然顽固地反对苏联为力求达成协议而在十日提出的新建议。他们找不到有力的论据来为他们这种立场辩解。十五日开会时，轮到他们发言，但他们没有一人愿意发言，结果会议开了二分钟就散会了。
    苏联代表团在十七日会议上又提出一项新建议，表示同意三国代表的建议，对肃清德国军国主义问题在议程上的地位不加决定，而把它提交外长会议考虑。苏联代表葛罗米柯在提出这个新建议时指出：苏联一直坚持把肃清德国军国主义问题放在议程第一项的地位，以与它的重要性相称。苏联代表团之所以同意三国建议，只是因为它愿望使议程获得协议。
    甚至巴黎的大多数资产阶级报纸也不得不承认，苏联代表团尽了很大的力量来使会议完成它的任务。
    但是，美、英、法三国代表在阻挠取得协议、拖延时日的方针下，继续在十八、十九日会议上制造新的困难。他们又企图把已经取得协议的肃清德国军国主义问题的措词问题也作为议程中未获协议的部分。他们继续反对把苏联所提出的北大西洋公约及美国军事基地问题作为未获协议的议案列入议程。
