　　Celebrating "May Day," Opposing the United States Arming Japan!
　　Capital Residents Hold Demonstration Parade Today
　　[Our Newspaper] The people of all circles in the capital held a "May 1st Labor Day Demonstration Parade Rally" today.
　　Workers, troops, students, government cadres, citizens, women, children, literary and art workers, and athletes from all over the city, totaling more than 600,000, gathered this morning to hold meetings separately, and then divided into 70 columns to start the parade. The parade line is about twenty *li* long. 200,000 farmers in the suburbs also paraded in separate areas outside the city.
　　The capital workers participating in the parade and demonstration will hold high portraits of the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, portraits of the world laboring people's leader Stalin, portraits of leaders of various countries, as well as peace doves, production performance charts, production models, patriotic covenants, model production deeds, and comic strips of Japanese atrocities. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions also decided to hold a signature campaign at the "May Day Commemoration Meeting" for workers throughout the city to support the five major powers in concluding a peace treaty, and to vote against the United States arming Japan, and at the same time, to establish a patriotic covenant for all employees in the city. Employees of many factories have learned the five songs to be sung during the demonstration and have practiced formation for several days.
　　136 industries and businesses participated in the demonstration parade by district. All 577 businesses in Dong'an Market, with more than 600 capitalists, participated in the parade. The Daoxiangchun Food Store had 54 employees and 3 representatives of the capitalists participating, leaving only three people to handle the store, and the rest all participated. 7,500 industrial and commercial households in the Sixth District had 15,000 people participating in the parade.
　　Many housewives, nuns, Catholic nuns, etc., who had never participated in parades, gatherings, and other political activities in the past, will participate in this grand parade. After the vigorous anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda and education campaign launched throughout the city since April, they have all realized that American imperialism is plotting to rearm Japan and undermine the peaceful and happy lives of the Chinese people. Many people said: We want to participate in the parade to show our strength; let the American devils know that our hearts are united and our strength is great! If they dare to come, we will beat them to death! Except for the sick, pregnant women, and some old ladies, 70% of the young, middle-aged, and elderly men and women on the streets participated in the parade. Last year, only two people from Mianhua Hutong in the Second District participated in the May Day parade, but this year 98 people participated. Many women prepared new clothes and new headscarves to meet the people's leader Chairman Mao today.

　　庆祝“五一”节，反对美国武装日本！
    首都人民今天举行示威大游行
    【本报讯】首都各界人民于今日举行“庆祝五一劳动节示威游行大会”。
    全市工人、部队、学生、机关干部、市民、妇女、少年儿童、文艺工作者及运动员等大队共六十余万人，于今晨分别集中举行大会后，将分为七十路纵队开始游行。游行行列长约二十里。郊区农民二十万人同时在城外分区游行。
    参加游行示威的首都工人，将高举中国人民领袖毛主席画像、世界劳动人民领袖斯大林画像、各国人民领袖画像，以及和平鸽子，生产成绩图表，生产模型，爱国公约，生产模范事迹和日寇暴行的连环画。北京市总工会并决定在“五一纪念大会”上举行全市工人拥护五大国订立和平公约的签名、反对美国武装日本的投票，同时订立全市职工的爱国公约。许多工厂的职工都学会了示威时唱的五支歌曲，并编队操练了好几天。
    工商界一百三十六个行业人士，分区参加示威游行。东安市场全体场商五百七十七户，资方参加游行的在六百人以上。稻香春食品店职工五十四人，资方代表三人，只留三人支应门市，其余全体参加。六区工商户七千五百户，有一万五千人参加游行。
    许多过去从不参加游行、集会等政治活动的家庭妇女，尼姑、天主教修女等都要参加这次大游行。经过四月份以来全市轰轰烈烈展开的抗美援朝宣传教育，她们都认识到美帝国主义阴谋重新武装日本、破坏中国人民和平、幸福的生活。许多人都说：咱们要参加游行，摆摆咱们的力量；让美国鬼子们知道知道咱们的心又齐，力量又大！它要敢来，就揍死它！街道上除去病人、孕妇和有些老太太以外，百分之七十的青、壮、老年男女都参加游行。二区棉花胡同去年五一游行时只有二人参加，今年参加五一游行的有九十八人。许多妇女预备了新衣服、新头巾，准备今天来见人民领袖毛主席。
