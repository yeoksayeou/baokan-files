The experience of Nan靖 County's Seventh District in Fujian Province in eliminating bandits is worthy of study by various regions.

Nan靖 County's Seventh District in Fujian Province, by fully mobilizing the masses and starting with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, launched a comprehensive campaign to eliminate bandits. They captured Li KaiRui, a local tyrant and notorious bandit leader, which helped to quell the banditry in the three counties of Nan靖, PingHe, and Zhang浦. In this bandit suppression work, there were valuable experiences that are worth learning from other places.

Before liberation, Li KaiRui served as the head of the self-defense forces for the three counties of Jing (Nan靖), He (PingHe), and Pu (Zhang浦) under the Kuomintang, and was a major local tyrant who committed all kinds of evil and oppressed the people. After liberation, Li KaiRui sneaked back to his hometown in the Seventh District of Nan靖 County and organized local reactionary landlords, hoodlums, and scattered Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to form armed bandits. He directly contacted the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Jinmen and appointed himself commander of the First Column of the 12th Corps of the Zhang Long Region and commander of the First Column of the Zhangzhou Military District. He killed the local secretary of the Communist Party District Committee and the head of the People's Government of the Fifth District, instigated the rebellion of the local armed forces of two districts, and used bloody terrorist tactics to persecute the people. At its peak, this group of armed bandits numbered more than two thousand people. After the People's Liberation Army carried out a large-scale three-month campaign to eliminate them at the end of last year, most of the bandits were wiped out, but more than 300 bandits still remained in the county. At this time, Li KaiRui led 39 of the most stubborn counter-revolutionaries, utilizing the objective conditions of Nan靖's Seventh District, such as high mountains, dense forests, vast areas, and dispersed population, and based on feudal reactionary forces, established a large intelligence network to carry out covert activities, so that our bandit suppression troops could not completely eliminate them for a time.

At the beginning of this year, the bandit suppression troops held a meeting to specifically discuss the issue of continuing to eliminate bandits, and many methods were formulated. Starting on January 10th, the troops were dispatched every day, but for more than ten days in a row, there was very little progress. At this time, it was discovered that the composition of the rural government in Nan靖's Seventh District was not pure, and part of the farmers' association was also controlled by reactionary forces. Some farmers' association cadres were found to be communicating with, funding, and harboring bandits. Because the masses of farmers were controlled by reactionary landlords, their emotions were passive and indifferent, so although the troops were actively acting, they could not obtain reliable intelligence. Therefore, the local military leadership organs determined to fully mobilize the masses, starting with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, to eliminate the bandits' eyes and ears in order to eradicate the bandit scourge.

The CCP District Committee and the District People's Government of Nan靖's Seventh District, according to the above principles, held a 260-person district-wide farmers' representative conference from January 28th to February 2nd, and carried out education on grievance-telling, digging up roots, suppressing bandits, and opposing bullies. Subsequently, 276 militiamen were also trained. After these educations, the class consciousness of the masses of farmers was raised, the enemy-us boundary was drawn, and they knew that bandits, bullies, and landlords were one family and the root of the poor people's suffering, and that to turn the tables and divide the land, bandits must first be eliminated. However, there were still some doubts and concerns. At this time, the leadership purged the impure elements in various organizations and issued some guns to reliable militiamen, which greatly increased the confidence of the masses. Subsequently, a district-wide public trial of seven bandit leaders, including Huang GaoRong, was held. At the beginning of the meeting, the masses still thought it was a method of shooting one and letting go of seven, fearing retaliation from the bandits in the future, so they did not dare to accuse them. After all seven bandits were shot, the masses unanimously shouted "Good!" and said, "If you had done this earlier, we would have done it long ago!" "If you kill them in two or three batches like this, there will be no bandits." On the spot, the masses proposed: "Whoever harbors bandits is guilty of the same crime as bandits," and "No communication with bandits, no sending food or letters to bandits," and other measures. The next day, the masses actively acted.

On February 5th, which was the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month, Li KaiRui received a report from a bandit-communicating and bandit-harboring element saying: "The government is determined to catch you, you must leave here quickly!" He then led nine bandits to transfer. When the local farmers found out, they immediately reported to the bandit suppression troops, resulting in the capture of Li's company commander and guards, totaling three people. The emotions of the masses were even higher, and the militiamen voluntarily proposed: to guarantee the capture of Li KaiRui within twenty-eight days. That night and the next day (the first day of the lunar new year), village militiamen cooperated with the troops to search for bandits in the mountains, and another trusted company commander of Li was captured, and two other bandits surrendered to the government. At this time, a mass campaign to eliminate bandits was launched. During the day, five or six hundred people took earth guns, spears, and broadswords to the mountains to suppress bandits, and at night, guards were stationed on roads of all sizes in each village. When the families of the bandits saw the situation was not good, they went everywhere to find their children who were bandits to surrender. In a few days, bandit detachment deputies, battalion commanders, company commanders, pseudo-district chiefs, and others surrendered to the government.

On February 12th, the entire district took action together, arresting more than sixty reactionary elements who were known to communicate with and harbor bandits. This shattered the social foundation of the bandits, dug out their eyes and ears, and took away their rice bowls. That night, Li KaiRui and two others ran to a small village to beg for food. A woman in the village, who was a representative of the farmers' association, gave Li food while sending a child to report to the troops. When the troops arrived, Li fled. The troops chased for more than twenty miles and surrounded the bandits. The masses, hearing the news, came to help, numbering over a thousand people. As a result, one bandit was killed, and Li fled again. The masses estimated that he could not run far, so they set up a large encirclement and posted guards everywhere. On the 14th, the district leaders led the masses to launch a struggle against the bullies. On the 15th, three thousand people went to the mountains to suppress bandits, unanimously stating: they would not come down the mountain until Li KaiRui was captured. That night, Li, hungry for two days and two nights, went down the mountain to beg for food. The masses reported to the troops, who finally killed Li. The masses were excited and held a celebration meeting to celebrate.

　　福建南靖七区肃清土匪的经验值得各地学习
    福建省南靖县七区，充分发动群众，从镇压反革命入手，展开全面清剿土匪运动，捉住了当地地头蛇作恶多端的大匪首李开瑞，使南靖、平和、漳浦三县的匪患得以平息。在这次剿匪工作中，有着宝贵的经验，值得其他地方学习。
    李匪开瑞解放前任国民党靖（南靖）、和（平和）、浦（漳浦）三县自卫总队长，为当地一大恶霸，为非作恶，鱼肉人民。解放后，李匪即潜回南靖县七区家乡，组织当地的反动地主、流氓和流散的蒋匪官兵，成立土匪武装，与金门蒋匪直接联系，自任匪十二兵团漳龙地区一纵队司令兼漳州分区一纵队司令，曾杀死当地中共区委书记和人民政府五区区长，策动两个区的区地方武装叛变，并用血腥的恐怖手段迫害人民群众。该股土匪武装最多时曾达二千多人。经人民解放军在去年底三个月的大力清剿，该股匪大部就歼，但全县还残存土匪三百多名。这时，李匪率领了最顽固的反革命分子三十九人，利用南靖七区山高、林密、地域辽阔、人口分散等客观条件，并以封建反动势力为基础，建立很大的情报网，进行隐蔽活动，致我剿匪部队一时不能将其彻底剿灭。
    今年年初，各剿匪部队曾召开会议，专门讨论继续清剿土匪问题，订出了许多办法。一月十日开始，部队天天出动，但一连十多天，成绩很少。这时，发现南靖七区乡村政权成分不纯，农会也有一部分为反动势力掌握，某些农会干部有通匪、资匪、窝匪现象。农民群众因受反动地主控制，情绪消极冷淡，所以部队虽积极行动，却得不到可靠情报。于是当地军事领导机关便确定充分发动群众，从镇压反革命入手，打掉土匪耳目，来铲除匪祸。
    南靖七区的中共区委和区人民政府，根据上述方针，于一月二十八日至二月二日，召开了二百六十人的全区农民代表大会，进行了诉苦、挖苦根、剿匪、反恶霸的教育。接着又集训了民兵二百七十六名。经过这些教育，农民群众的阶级觉悟提高，划清了敌我界线，知道土匪、恶霸、地主是一家，是穷人痛苦的根源，要翻身要分田必须先消灭土匪。但是仍然存在着一些疑问和顾虑。这时，领导上清洗了各种组织中的成分不纯分子，并发给可靠的民兵一些枪枝，群众有了自己的武装，信心大大增加。接着，又召开了全区公审黄高荣等七个土匪头子的大会。大会开始的时候，群众还以为是枪毙一个，放走七个的办法，害怕将来受土匪报复，所以不敢控诉。等到七个土匪一齐枪毙，群众才一致喊好，说：“早这么办，我们早就干起来了！”“像这样杀他二批三批，土匪就没有了。”当场群众就提出：“谁要窝匪，谁就与匪同罪”，以及“不通匪、不给匪送饭、送信”等办法。第二天，群众就积极地行动起来了。
    二月五日，即阴历十二月二十九日，李匪开瑞得到通匪窝匪分子报告说：“政府下决心要捉你，你快离开这里！”便率领九个匪徒转移。当地农民群众一发觉，立即报告剿匪部队，结果捕获李匪的中队长和卫兵等三名。群众的情绪更高了，民兵自动提出：保证在二十八天内捉住李开瑞。当天夜晚和第二天白天（旧历正月初一）各村民兵配合部队纷纷上山搜匪，又捕获李匪的亲信中队长一人，另有二名土匪向政府自新。这时，群众性的清剿土匪运动开展起来了，白天五六百群众拿着土枪、长矛、大刀上山剿匪，夜间各村大小道路一齐站岗。土匪家属见势头不妙，到处找当土匪的子弟出面自新。几天中，匪支队附、大队长、中队长、伪区长等纷纷到政府投降。
    二月十二日，全区一齐下手，抓了六十多个通匪、窝匪有据的反动分子。这就把土匪的社会基础打烂，耳目挖掉，饭碗夺去。当天晚上，李匪开瑞等三人跑到一个小庄子要饭吃。该庄一个妇女，是农民代表会的代表，一面给李匪吃饭，一面派孩子报告部队。当部队开去时，李匪逃逸。部队紧追二十多里，将匪包围，群众闻讯自动前来协助，数达千余人。结果打死了一个土匪，李匪又逃走了。群众估计他跑不远，就布置下一个大包围圈，到处站岗放哨，十四日，区里领导群众展开了反恶霸斗争。十五日，三千群众上山剿匪，一致表示：不捉住李开瑞不下山。当晚，李匪因饿了二天二夜下山求食，群众报告部队，终将李匪击毙。群众兴奋鼓舞，召开庆祝会庆祝。
