　　Oppose American Aggression, Defend World Peace
    Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    This year, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people are celebrating the "May Day" festival of working people around the world and inspecting their own ranks amidst the serious failures of American imperialism's war of aggression against Korea, its attempts to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan, its rearmament of Japan, and its conspiracies to expand its war of aggression. Today, under the call of the great Marshal Stalin's policy of peace, the working people of the world have become an immensely powerful fighting force against aggression and in defense of peace.
    The American imperialist warmonger Truman launched a war of aggression in Korea and occupied Taiwan in China. He vainly attempted to cross the Yalu River to attack our Northeast; he vainly attempted to incorporate the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops to harass our mainland; and he also wanted to reinforce the French imperialist puppet Bao Dai to threaten our Southwest. American imperialism attempted to create an arc-shaped encirclement around us, vainly attempting to overthrow the Chinese people's regime.
    War mongers! I warn you emphatically that you have failed utterly! The heroic operations of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, with their overwhelming combat power, repelled the American imperialist and Syngman Rhee aggressor troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and winning brilliant victories.
    American imperialism has not yet learned the lessons it should have from its failures in the Korean War, and still wants to perfidiously conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, turning Japan into a vassal of American imperialism. It has also released the heinous Japanese war criminals in order to restore fascist rule in Japan and help American imperialism attack China again.
    The bloody crimes committed by Japanese imperialism in China in the past are something the Chinese people will never forget. As far back as the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese invading army wanted to kill all the civilians in Lushun; as recently as the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invading army carried out the Nanjing Massacre and the Hong Kong Massacre, raping, looting, burning, and killing everywhere. More than ten million Chinese people were brutally murdered, and property losses exceeded 10 million trillion yuan in RMB. Can the Chinese people forget these monstrous crimes of Japanese imperialism? The Chinese people will never forget.
    One of the most significant goals of American imperialism in arming Japan is to eagerly restore the fascist rule of Japanese militarism, expand its aggressive war conspiracies, and undermine China's cause of peaceful and democratic construction, vainly attempting to drag the Chinese people back to the dark ages when they lived under the oppression and enslavement of imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese working class, have gone through a long and arduous struggle and have already achieved revolutionary victory. They have the right to consolidate their regime, which they have built with blood and sweat, and to maintain their good life, and they will never allow any enemy to carry out any destructive actions or conspiracies.
    Today, Chinese workers, under the new democratic regime, have become masters of the country. Would they still be willing to let the enemy destroy this regime and return to the slave life of being treated worse than animals? Would Zhao Guilan, the good daughter of the Party, still be willing to live the life of begging on the streets that she used to? Would the model female worker Li Fenglian still be willing to live the life of relying on wild vegetables and elm leaves as her main food source? Would Li Yong, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, still be willing to live the life of being enslaved by landlords, suffering from hunger and cold? Would Liu Yingyuan, the worker-director, still be willing to live the hungry days of herding pigs and cattle?
    The Chinese working class will also never forget the bloody case of Wang Xiaohe, a worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, who was framed and bravely sacrificed by secret agents; they will never forget the bloody case of Liang Renda, who was beaten to death alive by secret agents in the Shanghai Quanggong Building. How can we forget the bloody case of the workers of the Shanghai Shenxin No. 9 Factory being murdered? How can we forget the bloody case of the workers of the Chongqing Daduokou Ordnance Factory being shot by secret agents? We can never forget the historically significant bloodshed of the "February 7th" and "May 30th" anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements of the working class.
    It is not difficult to understand why the Chinese working class particularly cherishes the new democratic regime, because only under the new democratic regime can the Chinese working class obtain full political rights and economic benefits, and then steadily embark on the long-term goal of a socialist society. The Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, promulgated by the Central People's Government last year, legally consolidated the democratic and free rights of the Chinese working class. The Chinese working class widely participates in the government organization and enterprise management, and fully enjoys cultural and recreational life. The Labor Insurance Regulations passed by the Administrative Council solved the most painful and difficult to solve special difficulties and concerns in the lives of the broad masses of employees, such as birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability. This is an unprecedented initiative in China. All of this is entirely due to the fact that under the correct leadership of their own political party, the Chinese Communist Party, and their own leader, Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class, after nearly 30 years of arduous struggle, finally destroyed the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established a people's regime led by the working class. The Chinese working class has shattered thousands of years of shackles and obtained a democratic and happy life. "Chairman Mao is our great savior," and "The Communist Party has come, and we have turned ourselves over," are the cheers that can be heard everywhere in factories and mines from the masses of workers.
    Resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending world peace, is the primary task of struggle for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people today. This task of struggle is a struggle between happiness and disaster, a struggle between light and darkness, a struggle between freedom and democracy and dictatorship and fascism. Therefore, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have widely launched a patriotic movement. Countless workers and staff members enthusiastically joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, and with their lives and blood on the Korean battlefield, they struck at the enemy's frenzied arrogance, making a great contribution to defending world peace.
    Resisting America and aiding Korea is inseparable from the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Counter-revolutionaries are the running dogs of imperialism and the enemies of the people. They willingly betray their motherland and try every means to undermine the people's regime. Today, we must thoroughly suppress these wolf-hearted and dog-lunged traitors, secret agents, and counter-revolutionaries. Gu Zhenggang, Ma Chaojun, and Lu Jingshi, the secret agent bandits whose hands are stained with the blood of workers, you have murdered countless outstanding workers in the past, and you are still continuing to murder Chinese workers. Your crimes will not escape the giant palms of the people. One day, you will kneel before the people and be subjected to the public trial of the people. You will hear the roar of the people: "Shoot them! Shoot these great criminals!"
    In this patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, the Chinese working class has also launched a patriotic production competition movement. In January of this year, after the Ma Hengchang team issued a challenge to all employees across the country, it immediately received a warm response from employees across the country, making the patriotic production competition a big step forward compared to last year. According to incomplete statistics from the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in the first quarter of this year, there were 2,811 factories and mines and 2.23 million employees participating in the competition; 5,522 teams across the country have responded to the Ma Hengchang team.
    With the widespread development of this competition and the continuous improvement of labor productivity, many factories and mines have completed or exceeded their production tasks ahead of schedule. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded its first-quarter production task on March 25th, and the ironmaking department exceeded the highest output during the enemy and puppet era only four days after starting the furnace. Seventeen mining areas in Northeast Coal Mines completed the first-quarter task ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 4.7 percent. Thirty-eight factories and mines in Shenyang alone completed the first-quarter task ahead of schedule. The Ma Hengchang team completed the first-quarter production task half a month ahead of schedule.
    Because the masses of employees fully exerted their creativity and enthusiasm in the patriotic labor competition, they constantly created amazing new records. For example, the Li Junting team of wind pick operators at the Jiawang Coal Mine created a national record by mining 258.75 tons of coal in seven hours. The first factory of the Shanghai Wire Factory increased the copper content of electrolytic copper from 99.90 percent to 99.97 percent, creating a national record. The Nanchang bridge team of the Shanghai Railway Bureau also created a national record by completing the replacement of a bridge span in 18 minutes. Workers at the Wuxi Huachang Silk Factory used the vertical reeling machine to produce Grade A silk and the sitting reeling machine to produce Grade B silk, creating the highest record in the quality of raw silk products in the country in the past 14 years.
    The Chinese working class's patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea has made great achievements and greatly strengthened the power to oppose aggression and defend world peace and democracy.
    The American imperialists and their servant states' war of aggression in Korea and their other conspiracies to expand the war in Asia and Europe have been opposed by the working class all over the world and all good people who support world peace. The working class and people of Japan will soon realize what the consequences of America's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan will be. Japan's progressive trade unions and democratic groups are demanding an overall peace treaty and opposing a separate peace treaty. In Fukuoka Prefecture alone, 63,288 people have signed declarations demanding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. In Osaka City, the youth and women of the All-Japan Railway Workers' Union launched demonstrations under the banner of opposing war.
    At the European Workers' Congress held in Berlin, Germany in March of this year, the West German delegation declared: We guarantee that we will resolutely not allow West Germany to rearm, and we will drive Eisenhower and other American war mongers out of Germany. In the American imperialists' own country, the government has frozen wages in preparation for war, which has been opposed by the broad masses of workers. In February of this year, there were 600 strikes, double the number from last year. Workers at 160 wool factories in the United States, disregarding the U.S. Army authorities' threats to draft them into the army, continued their strikes demanding wage increases and improved working conditions, refusing to enter factories to produce wool for war.
    When American imperialism began launching its war of aggression in Korea, the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement denouncing American imperialism's armed aggression and calling on trade union members around the world to support the just war of the Korean People's Army. In this year's "May Day" proclamation, it called on the working class around the world to take unified action to block the road to a new war.
    The working class of the whole world and all peace-loving and democratic people are united, standing at the forefront of opposing American aggression and defending world peace, supporting the resolutions of the World Peace Council, demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty, opposing the rearmament of West Germany, opposing the rearmament of Japan, and opposing aggression against Korea. This is an immeasurable huge force against aggression. Justice is on our side. As long as we strengthen unity, strengthen resistance to aggression, and defend world peace, the final victory will surely belong to us.

　　反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平
    中华全国总工会副主席  朱学范
    中国工人阶级和中国人民，今年是在美帝国主义侵朝战争遭受严重失败，企图单独对日媾和，进行武装日本，并阴谋扩大侵略战争的情况下，来庆祝全世界劳动人民的“五一”节日，检阅劳动人民自己的队伍。今天全世界劳动人民在伟大的斯大林大元帅和平政策号召下，成为反对侵略，保卫和平的强大无比的战斗力量。
    美帝国主义战贩头子杜鲁门，在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，在中国侵占了台湾。妄想跨过鸭绿江来进攻我国的东北；妄想收编蒋介石的残余匪军，侵扰我国的大陆；还想增援法帝国主义的傀儡保大，来威胁我国的西南。美帝国主义企图对我造成一个弧形的包围圈，妄想推翻中国人民的政权。
    战争贩子们！我肯定地警告你们，你们已经彻头彻尾失败了！朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的英勇作战，以排山倒海的战斗力量打退了美帝国主义和李承晚侵略军，给敌人以严重的伤亡，获得了辉煌的胜利。
    美帝国主义在侵朝战争中还没有在失败的经验中取得应有的教训，还想背信弃义，单独对日媾和，把日本变成美帝国主义的附庸。并释放了罪大恶极的日本战犯，以求恢复日本的法西斯统治，帮助美帝国主义再来进攻中国。
    日本帝国主义过去在中国所犯血迹斑斑的罪行，是中国人民永远不会忘记的。远如甲午之役，日本侵略军要把旅顺平民杀尽杀绝；近如这次抗日战争，日本侵略军在南京大屠杀，香港大屠杀，到处奸淫掳掠，肆意烧杀。惨遭杀害的中国人民，在一千万人以上，财产损失在人民币一千万亿元以上。日本帝国主义这种滔天罪行，中国人民能忘记吗？中国人民是永远不会忘记的。
    美帝国主义武装日本最显著的目的之一，就是急于要恢复日本军国主义的法西斯统治，扩大侵略战争阴谋，破坏中国的和平民主建设事业，妄想把中国人民拖回到过去在帝国主义及其走狗压迫和奴役下过生活的黑暗时代。在中国工人阶级领导下，经过了长期的艰苦斗争，并已取得了革命胜利的中国人民，有权利巩固自己用血汗建立起来的政权，保持自己的好光景，绝不容许任何敌人作任何一种破坏的行动或阴谋。
    今天的中国工人，在新民主主义政权下，已成为国家的主人，难道还愿意这个政权任令敌人破坏再去过以前牛马不如的奴隶生活吗？党的好女儿赵桂兰，难道还愿意过以前那种在街上讨饭的生活吗？女工模范李凤莲，难道还愿意过以前那种以野菜和榆树叶为主要粮食的生活吗？毛泽东号机车司机长李永，难道还愿意过以前那种受地主奴役，饥寒交迫的生活吗？工人厂长刘英源，难道还愿意过以前那种放猪放牛的饥饿日子吗？
    中国工人阶级更永远忘不了上海电力公司工人王孝和烈士被特务陷害而壮烈牺牲的血案；永远忘不了梁仁达在上海劝工大楼活生生被特务打死的血案，我们怎能忘记上海申新九厂工人被杀害的血案呢？我们又怎能忘记重庆大渡口兵工厂工人被特务枪杀的血案呢？我们更忘不了工人阶级反帝反封建的“二七”和“五卅”有历史意义的大流血。
    中国工人阶级的所以特别珍贵新民主主义政权是不难理解的，因为只有在新民主主义政权下，中国工人阶级才能得到充分的政治权利和经济利益，进而稳步踏上社会主义社会的远景。去年中央人民政府公布的中华人民共和国工会法，以法律巩固了中国工人阶级的民主自由权利。中国工人阶级广泛地参加了政权组织和企业管理，充分享受了文化娱乐生活。政务院通过的劳动保险条例，替广大的职工群众解决了生活中最感痛苦而又难于解决的生、老、病、死、伤、残等等特殊困难和顾虑，这在中国是史无前例的创举。所有这些，完全由于中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产党和中国人民自己的领袖——毛主席的正确领导下，经过了将近三十年的艰苦斗争，终于摧毁了帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的统治，建立了由工人阶级领导的人民政权的结果，中国工人阶级粉碎了千百年来的枷锁，获得了民主幸福的生活。“毛主席是咱们的大救星”，“共产党来了，咱们有了大翻身”，这是在工厂、矿场中到处可以听到的工人群众流露出来的欢声。
    抗美援朝，保卫世界和平，是中国工人阶级与中国人民目前首要斗争任务。这一斗争任务是幸福与灾害的斗争，是光明与黑暗的斗争，是自由民主与独裁法西斯的斗争。因此，中国工人阶级和中国人民广泛地展开了爱国主义运动。无数工人职员群众踊跃地参加了中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜战场上以生命和鲜血，打击了敌人的疯狂气焰，对保卫世界和平，有了伟大的贡献。
    抗美援朝与镇压反革命是分不开的。反革命分子是帝国主义的走狗，是人民的公敌。他们甘心背叛祖国，想尽方法，企图破坏人民政权。在今天，狼心狗肺的汉奸、特务、反革命分子，我们一定要加以彻底镇压。双手沾满工人鲜血的谷正纲、马超俊、陆京士特务匪徒们，你们过去谋害了无数优秀工人，现在还在继续进行谋害中国工人的勾当。你们的罪恶，将逃不出人民的巨掌。总有一天，你们将跪在人民的面前，受人民的公审。你们将自己听到人民的怒吼：“枪毙！枪毙这些大罪犯！”
    就在这一抗美援朝的爱国主义运动中，中国工人阶级更展开了爱国主义的生产竞赛运动。今年一月，马恒昌小组向全国职工提出挑战后，立刻得到全国各地职工群众的热烈响应，使爱国主义生产竞赛，比去年更推进了一大步。据中华全国总工会生产部不完全的统计，在今年第一季度中即有二八一一个厂矿单位，二二三万职工参加竞赛；全国已有五五二二小组向马恒昌小组应战。
    随着这一竞赛的广泛展开和劳动生产率的不断提高，很多厂矿提前或超额完成了生产任务。如石景山钢铁厂于三月二十五日全部超额完成第一季生产任务，炼铁部开炉才四天就超过了敌伪时代的最高产量。东北煤矿十七个矿区提前完成了第一季度任务，而且超过了百分之四点七。沈阳一地就有三十八个厂矿提前完成第一季任务。马恒昌小组提前半个月完成了第一季度生产任务。
    由于职工群众在爱国主义劳动竞赛中充分发挥了创造性与积极性，不断创造出惊人的新纪录。如贾汪煤矿风镐手李君亭小组，以七小时采煤二五八·七五吨，创造了全国最高纪录。上海电线厂第一厂，电解铜含铜量从百分之九九·九○提高到百分之九九·九七，创造了全国最高纪录。上海铁路局南昌桥工队，以十八分钟完成换架一孔桥梁，也创造了全国最高纪录。无锡华昌丝厂工人，用立缫车缫出四甲级丝，用坐缫车缫出三甲级丝，创造了十四年来全国生丝产品质量的最高纪录。
    中国工人阶级的抗美援朝爱国主义运动已有巨大的成就，大大加强了反对侵略，保卫世界和平民主的力量。
    美帝国主义及其仆从国家在朝鲜的侵略战争及其他在亚洲和欧洲扩大战争的阴谋，已遭受到全世界工人阶级和拥护世界和平的一切善良人民的反对。日本的工人阶级与人民，很快会认清美国单独对日媾和和武装日本将带来的后果是怎样？日本的进步工会与民主团体要求全面媾和，反对单独媾和。单在福冈县已有六三、二八八人在要求全面对日媾和的宣言上签了名。在大阪市，全日铁路工会的青年与妇女，在反对战争的旗帜下，展开了游行示威。
    今年三月在德国柏林召开的欧洲工人代表大会上，西德代表团声明：保证坚决不让西德重新武装，要把艾森豪威尔等美国战贩们赶出德国去。在美帝国主义者自己的国家内，为了备战，政府冻结了工资，已遭受广大的工人群众反对，今年二月发生罢工六百次，比去年增加一倍。美国一六○个毛织工厂的工人，不顾美国陆军当局威胁征召入伍的命令，仍继续要求增加工资和改善劳动条件的罢工，拒绝进厂生产用于战争的呢绒。
    世界工联在美帝国主义开始在朝鲜发动侵略战争时，就发表声明，申斥美帝国主义的武装侵略，并号召全世界的工会会员支援朝鲜人民军的正义战争，在今年的“五一”文告中，又号召全世界工人阶级统一行动，以阻塞新战争的道路。
    全世界工人阶级与一切爱好和平民主的善良人民团结在一起，站在反对美国侵略保卫世界和平的最前列，拥护世界和平理事会决议，要求五大国缔结和平公约，反对武装西德，反对武装日本，反对侵略朝鲜。这是一个无法估计的反侵略的巨大力量。正义在我们一方面。只要我们加强团结，加强反抗侵略，保卫世界和平，最后胜利一定是属于我们的。
