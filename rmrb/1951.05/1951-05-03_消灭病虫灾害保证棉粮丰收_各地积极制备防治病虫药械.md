　　Eliminate Pests and Diseases to Guarantee a Bumper Harvest of Cotton and Grain
    Various Regions Actively Prepare Medicines and Equipment for Pest and Disease Control

    In order to guarantee increased agricultural production this year, people's governments in various regions have actively carried out preparations for pest and disease control. From last winter to this spring, many regions have held technical training classes on pest and disease control and have established or strengthened pest and disease control organizations. For example, provinces such as Shanxi, Pingyuan, Henan, and Fujian have established pest and disease control stations at the special district level. Agricultural and forestry departments in various regions have cleared out old stocks of medicines and equipment, and have also purchased, transported, and manufactured a large number of agricultural medicines and equipment for use by farmers in various regions. In the Northeast region, during the first quarter of this year, more than 220,000 jin of pest control agents such as copper sulfate, lead arsenate, tobacco powder, and soda soap powder have been manufactured, and 150 tons of cotton oil soap for controlling cotton aphids have been ordered from North China. Shanxi Province has prepared more than 190,000 jin of seed disinfection and insecticide agents, and 1,000 seed soaking thermometers. In addition to preparing more than 156,000 jin of various disinfection and insecticide agents, Suiyuan Province has also prepared 850,000 jin of liquor for seed mixing, 1,500 sprayers, and 250 dusters. Chahar Province has prepared 450,000 jin of liquor for seed mixing. In order to prevent underground pests such as mole crickets, Shandong has prepared 300,000 jin of arsenic trioxide agents. Henan Province has ordered 100,000 jin of cotton oil soap in preparation for controlling cotton aphids, and has allocated more than 150 sprayers and 500 jin of sodium fluosilicate to the Xuchang tobacco and cotton producing area. Guangxi Province has prepared medicines and equipment for pest and disease control worth more than 80 million yuan. Handan Special District, the main cotton producing area of Hebei Province, has prepared more than 23,000 sprayers and 120,000 jin of cotton oil residue. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has ordered approximately 72,500 sprayers on behalf of various provinces in North China, as well as the Northwest, Southwest, Inner Mongolia, and the suburbs of Beijing, during the first quarter of this year, and has also sent 348 tons of "666" powder and more than 1,900 sprayers to Suiyuan, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hunan and other provinces for locust control.
    The above-mentioned medicines and equipment have all been proven effective through repeated trials and are welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. In areas where the masses are not yet accustomed to using them, people's governments in various regions have sent technical cadres to provide guidance. For example, in mid-March, Suiyuan Province sent more than 50 technical cadres to various regions to conduct publicity and mobilization among the masses to promote seed soaking and mixing techniques.

　　消灭病虫灾害保证棉粮丰收
    各地积极制备防治病虫药械
    各地人民政府为了保证今年农业增产，积极进行了防治病虫害的准备工作。去冬直到今春，很多地区举办了防治病虫害的技术训练班，建立或加强了病虫害防治机构。如山西、平原、河南、福建等省，均以专区为单位，建立了病虫害防治站。各地农林部门，清理了旧存药械，并购运和制造了大量农用药械，供各地农民使用。东北区在今年第一季内已制造硫酸铜、砒酸铅、烟草粉、面碱肥皂粉等治虫药剂二十二万余斤，并从华北订购了防治棉花蚜虫的棉油皂一百五十吨。山西省已备妥种籽消毒和杀虫药剂十九万余斤，浸种用温度计一千支。绥远省除备妥各种消毒及杀虫药剂十五万六千余斤外，又备制了拌种用烧酒八十五万斤，喷雾器一千五百架、喷粉器二百五十架。察哈尔省准备了拌种用酒四十五万斤。山东为了防治蝼蛄等地下害虫，已准备了信石药剂三十万斤。河南省已订制十万斤棉油皂，准备除治棉蚜，并拨发给许昌烟棉产区喷雾器一百五十余架，氟矽酸钠五百斤。广西省准备了价值八千余万元的防治病虫害药械。河北省主要产棉区邯郸专区，已准备了二万三千余架喷雾器和十二万斤棉油渣。此外，中央人民政府农业部在今年第一季度中，已代华北各省及西北、西南、内蒙古和北京郊区订购喷雾器约七万二千五百余架，并发往绥远、河北、平原、山西、山东、河南、湖南等省治蝗用“六六六”粉三百四十八吨和喷雾器一千九百余架。
    以上各种药械都是屡经试用有效并为广大农民所欢迎的。在群众还没有使用习惯的地区，各地人民政府已派技术干部前往指导，如绥远省三月中旬曾派出技术干部五十余人，分赴各地向群众进行宣传动员，推广浸种、拌种技术。
