　　Panchen and Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Personnel Issue Statement
　　Endorsing Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
　　[Report from this newspaper] Panchen Erdeni and all personnel of the Panchen Kanpo Hall issued a statement endorsing the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　The Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government have reached a satisfactory agreement on the issue of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. From this point on, the Tibetan people have cast off the shackles of imperialism and returned to the great family of the motherland. All the people of China are jubilant and inspired by this significant event. As members of the Tibetan nationality, we are filled with an excitement that is even more difficult to express.

　　For nearly a century, in order to achieve its aims of aggression against Tibet, imperialism maliciously created divisions between Tibet and the motherland, and also created internal divisions and disunity within Tibet. In the past, the reactionary Manchu Qing government and the Kuomintang government carried out various forms of deception and incitement against the Tibetan people. Due to these reasons, the Tibetan people suffered profound disasters. In the past, we were ignorant of the reactionary essence of the Kuomintang regime and hoped that they would resist imperialist aggression and safeguard the interests of the Tibetan people, but we were completely disappointed. Facts have proven that this solemn historical task can only be victoriously completed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now, the agreement concluded between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government declares the failure of imperialism's aggression against Tibet. The Tibetan people are united with all the nationalities of China, and the Tibetan people are united internally. From this point on, the Tibetan people have begun a new era in their history.

　　This agreement implements the spirit of the Common Program's ethnic policies and fully embodies the interests of the Tibetan people. The agreement first stipulates that the liberated Tibetan people have the right to exercise national regional autonomy. Over the past year, we have seen the brilliant achievements of ethnic policies in all aspects. In particular, from the construction achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we have deeply realized that the policy of national regional autonomy is indeed the most suitable and correct policy for helping the development of all minority nationalities within China. From now on, the Tibetan people will also enjoy all the rights stipulated in the ethnic policies, just like other fraternal ethnic peoples. Our religious beliefs and customs will be reasonably respected. Especially under the principle of national regional autonomy, we will receive the leadership of the Central People's Government and the assistance of the Han nationality, and through our own national forms, consciously and voluntarily carry out all necessary reforms, and gradually develop the political, economic, and cultural education undertakings of our nationality. The stationing of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tibet further guarantees that our Tibetan people will forever be free from imperialist aggression and oppression.

　　The agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet fully conforms to the interests of all the people of China, especially the Tibetan people. The conclusion of this agreement is first and foremost thanks to the wise leadership of our great people's leader, Chairman Mao, and thanks to Chairman Mao's parental care for our Tibetan people. We also thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the people of China. It is because of their struggle and efforts that imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang were overthrown, making the peaceful liberation of Tibet possible. At the same time, we deeply respect the fact that the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, upon assuming power, responded to the call of the Central People's Government for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, dispatched representatives to Beijing for negotiations, and signed the agreement.

　　For the thorough liberation and development of the Tibetan people, and for consolidating and developing the victory of the Chinese people, we will resolutely support the leadership of Chairman Mao, support the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to correctly implement all the agreements, for the unity of the Tibetan people with all the nationalities of China, and for the internal unity of the Tibetan people.

　　班禅及班禅堪布会议厅人员发表声明
    拥护和平解放西藏办法的协议
    【本报讯】班禅额尔德尼暨班禅堪布厅全体人员发表声明，拥护关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。声明全文如下：
    中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏问题，已经取得圆满的协议，西藏民族从此摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了伟大的祖国大家庭。中国各族人民都为这一重大的事件而欢欣鼓舞。我们是西藏民族，因而有着更加难以言喻的兴奋。
    近百年来，帝国主义为达其侵略西藏的目的，恶毒地制造了西藏与祖国间的分裂，同时也制造了西藏内部的分裂和不团结；过去，反动的满清政府和国民党政府，对西藏民族则进行了各种欺骗和挑拨，由于以上原因，使西藏民族遭受深重的灾难。过去我们昧于国民党政权的反动本质，曾希望他们反抗帝国主义的侵略，维护西藏民族的利益，结果完全失望。事实证明，这一庄严的历史任务，只有在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，才能胜利地完成。现在，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府成立的协议，宣告了帝国主义对于西藏侵略的失败，西藏民族与中国各民族团结起来，西藏民族内部团结起来。从此西藏民族开始了自己历史的新纪元。
    这次协议，贯彻了共同纲领中民族政策的精神，充分体现了西藏民族的利益。协议中首先规定，解放后的西藏民族，有实行民族区域自治的权利。一年来，我们从各方面看到了民族政策的光辉成就。特别是从内蒙古自治区的建设成绩中，我们更深深地认识了民族区域自治政策确是帮助中国境内各少数民族发展的最为适宜的正确的政策。从此西藏人民也将与其他兄弟民族人民一样，享受民族政策中所规定的一切权利。我们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯将受到合理的尊重。特别是在民族区域自治的原则下，我们将得到中央人民政府的领导与汉民族的帮助，通过自己的民族形式，自觉自愿地进行一切必要的改革，逐步地发展本民族的政治、经济和文化教育事业。中国人民解放军的进驻西藏，更保障了我们西藏民族永远免除帝国主义的侵略和压迫。
    中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，完全符合中国各族人民、特别是西藏民族人民的利益。这一协议的成立，我们首先深深地感谢我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席的英明领导，感谢毛主席对我们西藏民族父母般的关怀。我们也感谢中国人民解放军和中国各族人民，由于他们的奋斗努力，打倒了帝国主义和国民党反动统治，才使西藏和平解放成为可能。同时，达赖喇嘛十四世于其亲政之日即响应中央人民政府和平解放西藏的号召，派遣代表来京谈判，并签定了协议，这也是我们深为敬重的。
    为了西藏民族的彻底解放和发展，为了巩固和发展中国人民的胜利，我们今后坚决拥护毛主席的领导，拥护中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导，为正确执行全部协议，为西藏民族与中国各民族的团结和西藏民族内部的团结而奋斗。
