　　Building Party Propaganda Networks in Various Movements
       Shi Pu
    Editor's Note: Currently, many places have not done a good job in establishing Party propaganda networks. One of the reasons is that some leading cadres ideologically regard Party propaganda work as an "extra burden" that is opposed to practical work. In terms of working methods, propaganda work is carried out in isolation from practical work. The experiences of Mingyuedian in Ding County, Linyugong in Fuping, and Dongjie in Lincheng in establishing propaganda networks during movements correctly answer and solve this problem, creating good experiences.
    Until now, many comrades still believe that "doing propaganda work will affect central work" and "establishing propaganda networks conflicts with current work." This is a confused concept that has long existed in the minds of some people, and it is also a reflection of incorrect thinking methods and working methods. The fact that Mingyuedian in Ding County, Dongjie in Lincheng, and Linyugong in Fuping established propaganda networks from the current movement and powerfully promoted the current work through this work will give a powerful rebuttal to this erroneous understanding. The following is an introduction to this experience:
    These three villages are typical experimental villages established under the direct leadership of the local county and district Party committees of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province after the Second Party Propaganda Conference of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. Although there are slight differences in their specific practices, they have the following common characteristics:
    First, conveying the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network and carrying out ideological mobilization for establishing a propaganda network were carried out through the current production movement and other various works. Dongjie in Lincheng conveyed the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network while conveying the resolutions of the county Party congress, mobilizing for this year's large-scale production, and formulating production plans, and specifically clarified that to realize the 1951 Party congress resolutions and the village's production plan, there must be good propaganda work; to do a good job in propaganda work, a propaganda network must be established. Mingyuedian raised the issue of "To smoothly complete the production tasks and overcome coercion and commandism, propaganda work must be done well" when arranging spring plowing production and expanding cotton fields. Then, the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network and the specific plans of the county and district committees were conveyed, and discussions were launched in Party groups. Linyugong Village in Fuping also conveyed the spirit of the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network to Party members through the current production and the political movement against the rearmament of Japan by the United States. This made the establishment of the propaganda network consistent with the current tasks of the village from the beginning and dispelled the erroneous idea of some Party members and cadres that "establishing a propaganda network has added another burden." As Dongjie in Lincheng said after mobilization, "The Central Committee's decision is right! Nothing can be separated from propaganda work." "To transform the old society and build a new society, propaganda work is indispensable!"
    Second, start with checking the main work in the village, and at the same time check the current and past propaganda work, and seize the prominent examples related to the current central work and other works for analysis and criticism, to improve the ideological understanding of Party members (or League members).
    As mentioned above, after various mobilizations, Party members had a preliminary understanding of the establishment of propaganda networks; but it was still general and conceptual, and could not be combined with the specific situation of the village. It must be gradually opened up and improved through the analysis and criticism of specific examples. Mingyuedian in Ding County solved this problem by checking the current preparation work for cotton planting and the reasons why last year's cotton planting task was not completed. The branch committee member of the village reviewed that the failure to carry out propaganda mobilization well in cotton planting last year committed the mistake of coercion and commandism. At that time, Party member cadres scared the masses by saying: "Failure to complete the cotton planting task will be a mistake in principle and line." They did not care whether the masses were willing to plant or not, and checked the statistics every day. Later, the masses reported 1,400 mu, and the branch blindly believed that the task had been completed and exceeded, but when the cotton seedlings emerged and were checked, the village actually only planted more than 600 mu, and many masses planted cotton in sandy land. Through this inspection, Party members further realized that this was the result of not doing a good job in propaganda mobilization to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, and everyone felt: "We forced the masses, and the masses deceived us, and we deceived the higher authorities." Dongjie in Lincheng seized the autumn grain requisition work last year to conduct review and analysis. For example, everyone checked that during the autumn grain requisition in the northwest street of the village last year, the policy was not well publicized, and the task was not completed in seven and a half days. A Party member also reviewed: "There are more than 200 households in the village, and only 40 or 50 people attended the meeting each time in the past. We only complained that the masses were backward, so we committed commandism; but once the Party members were assigned to promote to the masses household by household, explaining the significance of the meeting, the masses arrived very neatly." This review made everyone realize that when propaganda work is done well, all kinds of work can be done well; when propaganda work is not done well, all kinds of work can not be done well. Some also said: "We can't just complain that the masses are backward, we must see if our propaganda work is done well."
    After the Party members had the above understanding, some branches immediately checked what achievements and shortcomings had been made in the past propaganda work? Why was it not done well? After inspection, the Linyugong branch in Fuping affirmed that the propaganda work in the past year has achieved results and played a great role in ensuring the completion of tasks in various periods; however, due to the lack of regular, systematic and in-depth propaganda, it has not played its due role. Dongjie in Lincheng checked the shortcomings of propaganda work in the village: Although on the surface they understood the importance of propaganda work, no one could really do propaganda work; propaganda work also suffered from hot and cold diseases, and propaganda was only carried out when the work was pressing. Moreover, everyone believed that holding meetings was doing propaganda work, and in the streets and dining places, let alone propaganda, they didn't even expose destructive words. Through such inspection, everyone further realized the importance of implementing the Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network and establish a regular propaganda work system, and solved the confused idea of some people that "Since doing propaganda is the duty of every Party member, everyone should pay attention to propaganda work, so why build another organization?"
    Third, combine the formulation of current production (or other work) plans, and at the same time formulate a work plan for establishing a propaganda network. And from the current movement and the progress of propaganda work, look for objects and cultivate and develop propagandists.
    Through the above inspection, the Mingyuedian branch in Ding County formulated a spring plowing production and cotton planting plan for the whole village, and in conjunction with the current production work, formulated a work plan for establishing a propaganda network, calling on Party members to do a good job in the current propaganda work to complete the spring plowing and cotton planting tasks, and to be an outstanding propagandist. Branch committee members checked the actual actions of Party and League members separately to find propaganda objects. The Dongjie branch in Lincheng and the Linyugong branch in Fuping first selected propaganda objects, and then arranged specific propaganda tasks for them based on the current central work for propaganda activities. Mingyuedian determined propaganda objects after a period of propaganda work.
    Once the propaganda objects are determined, they must be educated and trained in a timely manner, and the specific difficulties in their work must be resolved. Before carrying out propaganda, the Dongjie branch in Lincheng specifically studied and analyzed the current ideological situation of the masses under the guidance of propaganda objects, and determined the content of propaganda to prescribe the right medicine. For example, in response to the ideological concerns of the masses about cotton planting, it was determined to publicize the government's cotton price policy and the facts that cotton farmers benefited last year, and the village planned to buy sprayers and open technical training classes to solve the difficulties in cotton planting; in response to the waiting thoughts of some masses who are afraid of drought, the slogan "Prepare in advance whether it rains or not" was put forward. In addition, each village also divided propaganda areas and studied propaganda methods. Linyugong divided into seven propaganda areas, and propaganda objects were assigned to activities, using dining places, visiting relatives, and rest time for repairing beaches and digging canals to conduct propaganda in different ways. Dongjie in Lincheng also assigned special personnel to be responsible for blackboards and writing slogans, cadres used a series of meetings to publicize, and ordinary Party members used natural occasions to publicize. The Mingyuedian branch promptly commended activists in the process of propaganda work to promote everyone.
    Fourth, through summarizing a period of production or other work, evaluate models, and at the same time, the branch committee reviews and approves propagandists.
    After a period of practical work, the propaganda objects in these three villages have played a huge role and powerfully promoted the completion of the current tasks. The nine propaganda objects determined by the Linyugong branch, under the leadership of the branch, combined the opposition to the rearmament of Japan by the United States to mobilize large-scale production, stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses, and from the second half of the first lunar month to now (Note: It should be the end of March in the solar calendar), 142 households in the village chopped 100,000 catties of firewood and accumulated 20,000 dan of fertilizer, and 15,000 dan have been sent out in advance, and the production mood of the masses has greatly exceeded previous years. More importantly, due to the establishment of propagandists, the connection between the Party and the people has been greatly strengthened. For example, the masses in Linyugong Village went to the propagandists if they didn't understand something. The nine propagandists in the village closely united 240 masses (accounting for more than one-half of the village's population) around the branch due to fixed publicity to the masses by district.
    When the work came to an end and the propaganda objects had undergone a certain practical test, the branch summarized the work, evaluated the models, and at the same time reviewed and approved the propagandists. The Mingyuedian branch conducted it in groups, checking the implementation of the branch's resolutions by each Party member, checking and summarizing the work, and evaluating models and reviewing propagandists at the same time.
    Fifth, establish and improve the propagandist work system, and at the same time plan and arrange the next stage of production and other work, and make the system regular.
    Judging from the materials of these three villages, although they have paid attention to this issue, the regular work system of establishing and improving propagandists and the system of branch leadership of propagandists are not perfect enough. Dongjie in Lincheng has established a system of holding propagandist meetings on the 8th of every ten days; a learning and meeting research system is being planned and established. The Linyugong propagandist meeting system has not been well established. Therefore, it is recommended that the local county and district leaders further strengthen leadership, consolidate existing achievements, establish and improve various systems, and turn them into normal.
    Experience has proven that the quality of propagandists established in this way from the movement is high; and it is consolidated. At the same time, it has laid the foundation for serving various works at the beginning of the establishment of the propaganda network. The local Party committees of the Communist Party of China and comrades who lead propaganda work should well remember this valuable experience.

　　在各种运动中建立党的宣传网
       石璞
    编者按：目前还有许多地方没有把建立党的宣传网的工作作好。其原因之一，是某些领导干部在思想上把党的宣传工作当作与实际工作对立的一种“额外负担”；在工作方法上，则是离开实际工作孤立地进行宣传工作。河北定县明月店、阜平临榆工、临城东街在运动中建立宣传网的经验，正确地解答和解决了这个问题，创造了良好的经验。
    直到现在还有不少同志认为“搞宣传工作就要影响中心工作”，“建立宣传网与当前各种工作有矛盾”。这是长期存在于某些人头脑中的一种糊涂观念，同时也是一种错误的思想方法和工作方法的反映。定县明月店、临城东街、阜平临榆工从当前运动中建立了宣传网，并通过这一工作有力地推动了当前各种工作的事实，将会给这种错误的认识一个有力的反驳。下面就介绍这个经验：
    这三个村都是在中共河北省委二次党的宣传会议后，在当地中共县、区党委直接领导下建立宣传网的典型试验村。虽然他们在具体作法上有大同小异的地方，可是有以下几个共同特点：
    第一、传达中央建立宣传网的决定，进行建立宣传网的思想动员，是通过当前生产运动及其他各种工作进行的。临城东街是在传达县党代会决议，动员今年大生产、订生产计划时，传达了中央关于建立宣传网的决定，并特别阐明了要实现一九五一年党代会决议及全村生产计划，必须有很好的宣传工作；要想做好宣传工作，就必须建立宣传网。明月店是在布置春耕生产、扩大棉田时提出了：“为了顺利完成生产任务，克服强迫命令，必须做好宣传工作。”然后传达了中共中央关于建立宣传网的决定和县、区委的具体计划，在党员小组中展开了讨论。阜平临榆工村也是通过当前生产及反对美国重新武装日本的政治运动向党员贯彻讲述了中央建立宣传网决定的精神。这样使建立宣传网工作一开始就和村里的当前任务一致起来，并且解除了某些党员、干部认为“建立宣传网又增加了负担”的错误思想。如临城东街经过动员后，许多党员说：“中央决定对着哩！啥事也离不开宣传工作。”“改造旧社会，建设新社会，没有宣传工作可不行！”
    第二、从检查当前村中主要工作入手，同时检查当前与过去的宣传工作，并抓住与当前中心工作有联系的及其他工作上突出的事例，进行分析批判，提高党员（或团员）的思想认识。
    像上面讲过的，经过各种动员，党员对建立宣传网工作有了初步认识；但是还是笼统的、概念的，还不能与本村具体情况相结合，必须通过具体事例的分析批判，才能逐步打通思想提高觉悟。定县明月店是通过检查当前植棉的准备工作和去年植棉任务没有完成的原因解决这一问题的。该村支部委员检讨了由于去年植棉没有很好进行宣传动员，犯了强迫命令的错误。当时党员干部曾吓唬群众说：“完不成植棉任务即犯了原则路线的错误”。他们不管群众愿种不愿种，天天统计追查。后来群众报了一千四百亩，支部便盲目地认为已完成并超过任务了，但等棉花出土后进行检查，实际上全村只种了六百多亩，而且还有很多群众是把棉花种在沙地里。通过这个检查，党员们进一步认识了这是没有做好宣传动员解除群众思想顾虑的结果，大家都感到：“咱强迫群众，群众欺骗了咱，咱又欺骗了上级。”临城东街是抓住去年秋征工作来进行检讨分析的，如大家检查去年本村西北街秋征时，没有很好宣传政策，七天半还没完成任务。有个党员并作了检讨：“全村二百多户，过去开会每次只到四五十个人，咱光埋怨群众落后，因此就犯了命令主义；可是有一次党员分工挨户向群众宣传，说明开会意义后，结果群众到的很齐。”这个检讨使大家认识了宣传工作做的好，各种工作就做的好；宣传工作做不好，各种工作也就做不好。有的还说：“不能光埋怨群众落后，要看咱宣传工作做的好不好。”
    党员有了以上认识后，有些支部紧接着检查了过去宣传工作有些啥成绩？有些啥缺点？为啥没做好？阜平临榆工支部经过检查后，肯定了去年一年来的宣传工作是有成绩的，在保证各个时期工作任务的完成上起了很大作用；但因为缺乏经常、系统和深入的宣传，还没有起到应有的作用。临城东街检查本村宣传工作的缺点是：表面上虽然了解宣传工作重要，但是谁也不能实实在在去做宣传工作；宣传工作还犯有冷热病，工作逼住了才宣传。并且大家认为开会才是做宣传工作，在街头、饭场，不用说宣传，连听到破坏话也不去揭破。通过这样的检查，大家更进一步体会了执行中央决定建立宣传网、树立经常的宣传工作制度的重要意义，解决了某些人“既然做宣传是每个党员的天职，那么大家都注意宣传工作就是了，何必另建一套组织呢”的糊涂思想。
    第三、结合制订当前生产（或其他工作）计划，同时订出建立宣传网工作计划。并从当前运动与宣传工作的进行中来物色对象，培养发展宣传员。
    定县明月店支部通过上述检查，订了全村春耕生产、植棉计划，并结合当前生产工作的进行订出了建立宣传网的工作计划，号召党员作好当前宣传工作完成春耕、植棉任务，当一个出色的宣传员。支部委员则分头检查党、团员的实际行动来物色宣传员对象。临城东街支部，阜平临榆工支部是首先选择了宣传员对象，然后根据当前中心工作给他们具体布置宣传任务进行宣传活动。明月店是经过了一段宣传工作，然后确定宣传员对象的。
    宣传员对象既经确定，就必须及时地进行教育培养，并解决他们工作中的具体困难。临城东街支部，是领导宣传员对象在进行宣传以前，具体研究分析了当前群众思想情况，确定了对症下药的宣传内容，如针对群众对植棉中的思想顾虑，确定了要大量宣传政府棉价政策及去年棉农得利的事实，村里计划买喷雾器开技术训练班解决种棉困难等内容；针对某些群众的怕天旱的等待思想，提出“下雨不下雨，事前得准备”的口号。此外，各村还都划分了宣传区域，研究了宣传方法方式。临榆工划分了七个宣传区，宣传员对象分工活动，利用了饭场、串门、修滩挖渠的休息时间进行不同方式的宣传。临城东街并分工专人负责黑板报，写标语，干部利用召开一系列的会议，一般党员利用自然场合进行宣传。明月店支部在宣传工作进行中及时表扬了积极分子来推动大家。
    第四、通过总结一个时期的生产或其他工作，评选模范，同时支委会审查通过宣传员。
    这三个村经过一段实际工作的考验，宣传员对象都发挥了巨大作用，有力地推动了当前任务的完成。临榆工支部确定的九名宣传员对象，在支部领导下，结合反对美国重新武装日本来动员大生产，激发了群众的生产热情，从旧历正月后半月到现在（按：应是到阳历三月下旬），全村一百四十二户打柴十万斤，积肥两万担，并已提前送出了一万五千担，群众生产情绪大大超过往年。更重要的是，由于宣传员的建立，大大加强了党与人民群众的联系。如临榆工村群众有不明白的事都去找宣传员，该村九名宣传员由于分片固定向群众进行宣传，将二百四十名群众（占全村人口的二分之一强）紧密的团结在支部的周围。
    当工作告一段落，宣传员对象经过了一定的实际考验，便由支部进行总结工作，评选模范，同时审查通过宣传员。明月店支部是分小组进行，检查每个党员对支部决议执行的情况，检查总结工作，评选模范与审查宣传员同时进行。
    第五、树立与健全宣传员工作制度，同时计划与布置下一段生产和其他工作，并使制度转为经常。
    从这三个村的材料上来看，虽都注意了这个问题，但树立与健全宣传员的经常工作制度与支部领导宣传员的制度都还不够完善。临城东街已建立了每旬逢八开宣传员会议的制度；学习，碰头研究制度正在计划建立。临榆工宣传员会议制度还未很好建立。因此，建议当地的县、区领导上要进一步加强领导，巩固现有成果，树立与健全各种制度，并使之转为正常。
    经验证明，这样从运动中建立起来的宣传员，其质量是高的；并且是巩固的。同时在宣传网建立的开始就奠定下了为各种工作服务的基础。各地中共党委及领导宣传员工作的同志应很好记取这一宝贵经验。
