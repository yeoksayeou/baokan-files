　　Fengfeng Coal Mine Mobilizes Workers
    Increase Pit Prop Recovery Rate
    Saving Huge State Assets
    The state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine has grasped the crucial link of reducing pit prop consumption and mobilized workers to lower costs, with great results. In the past, pit prop consumption accounted for half of the mine's coal production costs. In the second half of March, the pit prop recovery rate in the 506 New Mining Area had increased from 70% to 95-100%, thereby reducing the direct production cost of each ton of coal by about one-quarter.
    In order to cooperate with the administration to achieve the goal of reducing pit prop consumption, the trade union cadres of the 506 New Mining Area conducted propaganda and education work among the workers after the administration issued a call. They proposed to the workers: "One pit prop is worth three pecks of grain, and one hundred pit props are worth a room," allowing the workers to concretely understand the extent of damage to state assets caused by wasting a pit prop. At the same time, the trade union cadres also explained to the workers that pit prop consumption accounted for half of the cost of coal production, proposing: "To resist America and aid Korea, we must reduce the cost of coal," enabling the workers to recognize the great significance of increasing the pit prop recovery rate. After the trade union repeatedly carried out education work, the workers came up with many good ways to recover pit props with great enthusiasm, and every time they removed a pit prop, they happily shouted: "Another sixty catties of rice, three people's wages!" After research, the workers understood that in order to make pit props easier to remove, it was necessary to arrange the timber stacks well first. Therefore, they came up with the "Five Essentials for Arranging Timber Stacks," which made the work of arranging timber stacks easier, more convenient, and able to protect the wood from breaking, and memorized it. Secondly, they also researched a good set of methods for dismantling timber stacks, allowing them to remove pit props that could not be removed in the past. While the workers were actively seeking ways to increase the pit prop recovery rate, the administrative side also changed each cycle operation time from three shifts to two shifts, reducing the "roofing" time (that is, after mining the coal, allowing the layer of shale directly above the coal seam to fall off) in the pit from thirty-two hours to sixteen hours. Because the time that pit props are subjected to top pressure is reduced by half, it is much easier for workers to dismantle them.

### 峰峰煤矿发动工人  提高坑木回收率  为国家节约巨大资财

　　峰峰煤矿发动工人
    提高坑木回收率
    为国家节约巨大资财
    国营峰峰煤矿抓住减少坑木消耗这一重要环节，发动工人降低成本，效果很大。过去坑木消耗占该矿煤炭生产成本的一半。在三月下半月，该矿五零六新采煤区的坑木回收率已由过去的百分之七十提高到百分之九十五至一百，因此使每一吨煤的直接生产成本降低了约四分之一。
    五零六新采煤区的工会干部为了配合行政达到减少坑木消耗的目的，在行政提出号召后，即向工人进行宣传教育工作。他们向工人提出：“一根坑木值三斗粮，百根坑木值一间房”，使工人具体体会到浪费一根坑木对于国家资财的损害程度。同时工会干部又向工人说明坑木消耗占煤炭生产成本的一半，提出：“要抗美援朝，就要降低煤炭成本”，使工人认识提高坑木回收率的重大意义。经过工会反复进行教育工作后，工人们以高度热情想出许多好办法来回收坑木，并且每拆出一根坑木，就高兴地喊道：“又是六十斤小米，三个人的工资！”工人们经过研究，了解到要使坑木好拆，必需先把木垛排好。于是他们就想出了使排木垛工作省劲、方便并能保护木头不折断的“排木垛五要”，把它记熟。其次，他们又研究出了一套拆木垛的好办法，使过去拆不出来的坑木都拆出来了。与工人积极设法提高坑木回收率同时，行政方面也把每一循环作业时间由三班改为两班，使坑内“放顶”（即采完煤以后，让原来煤层上面紧接岩石的一层页岩掉下来）时间由三十二小时减为十六小时。因坑木所受顶压时间缩短一半，工人拆起来就容易得多。
