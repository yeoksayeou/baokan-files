    Keshan County Native Produce Company Contacts Tax Bureau;
    Simplified Tax Payment Procedures for Native Produce Purchase
  (I) Letter from Keshan County People's Government Tax Bureau to the Editor:
    In the "Reader's Letters" column of the March 28th People's Daily, the suggestion from Comrades Liu Zengzhi and Mei Susheng regarding improvements to the procedures for purchasing native products in our county was published. This suggestion is excellent, and we implemented the first item of Comrades Liu and Mei's suggestions on April 1st.
    In the past, due to insufficient contact between our bureau and the Native Produce Company, these problems were not resolved in a timely manner. In the future, we plan to frequently utilize symposiums to connect with various state-owned enterprise departments, explain tax procedures and systems; and, under the principle of strictly enforcing tax laws, appropriately simplify procedures.
      Chen Zhibin, Director of the Keshan County People's Government Tax Bureau
  (II) Letter from Keshan County Native Produce Company to the Editor:
    The criticism of our office by readers Liu Zengzhi and Mei Susheng, published in your newspaper on March 28th, is completely accurate. Our self-criticism is as follows: We felt beforehand that such complicated procedures not only caused losses to the procurement work, but the masses must also be dissatisfied. To this end, we contacted the local tax bureau and suggested simplifying the procedures. At that time, the simplified method we proposed was the same as the first item of the readers' suggestions. However, because the local tax bureau had to wait for approval from the provincial bureau before changing the original procedures, we continued to implement them as before, pending a reply from the provincial bureau. It was at this time that the readers' opinions were raised. Although the problem was reasonably resolved on April 1st, we should still take this matter as a lesson. In future work, we must improve contact with all parties and overcome all artificial obstacles to provide vendors with more convenience.
    Liu Chunzhang, Song Cihua, Manager of the Keshan County Native Produce Company, Heilongjiang Province

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　克山县土产公司与税务局联系
    已简化土产收购纳税手续
  （一）克山县人民政府税务局来信编辑同志：
    三月二十八日人民日报《读者来信专页》栏中刊载了刘增智、梅苏生二同志对我县收购土产的手续应加改进的建议。这个建议很好，我们已于四月一日按着刘、梅二同志建议的第一项那样办了。
    过去由于我局和土产公司联系不够，这些问题也就没有得到及时解决。今后我们准备经常利用座谈会，和各公营企业部门取得连系，解释税收手续、制度；并在严格执行税法的原则下，适当地简化手续。
      克山县人民政府税务局局长  陈志斌
  （二）克山县土产公司来信编辑同志：
    三月二十八日贵报所载读者刘增智、梅苏生二同志对我处的批评完全属实。今作检讨如下：事先我们也感觉到手续这样繁杂，不但使收购工作受到损失，群众也一定不满意。为此，我们曾和当地税务局联络，建议简便手续。当时我们提出的简便办法，正与读者的建议第一项相同。但因当地税务局须待省局批准后才能变更原来的手续，所以在省局未答复前仍照旧执行。正在这个时候，读者的意见提出来了。虽然问题已于四月一日得到合理解决，但我们仍应把这件事引为教训，在今后的工作中要搞好各方面的联系，克服一切人为的障碍，给销售者以更多的方便。
    黑龙江省克山县土产公司经理  刘春昶  宋慈华
