　　Children Demand the Overthrow of American Imperialism
    Letter from Members of the Young Pioneers Team in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, After Listening to a Report from Returning Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
To the Editors:
    On April 4th, our teacher led us to listen to a report from the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army. We also saw the heroic bearing of the uncles with our own eyes. We were very excited, and our respect for the Volunteer Army uncles grew even stronger. At the meeting, we put our most beloved red scarves around their necks, presented them with our autograph books and photos as souvenirs, and shook hands with them cordially. But this cannot fully express our respect and love for the Volunteer Army uncles. The Volunteer Army uncles are not afraid of sacrifice, and they fight the enemy for the happiness of us children. How great is that!
    Every word of the uncles' reports touched our hearts and made us more aware of the cruelty of American imperialism. American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the people of the world, and it is also the deadly enemy of us children. Volunteer Army uncle Li Jitao said: "There was a Korean mother carrying her lovely baby, leaving her home that was burned down by the American devils. On the road, she was brutally murdered by the vicious American devils. A bullet passed through the mother's chest, through the baby's spine. The mother's blood flowed into the baby's chest, and the baby's blood flowed into the mother's chest, and the blood of the two merged together...." "In a certain place in Korea, a Korean mother was shot and killed by the American devils, and her body lay in a pool of blood, staining the white snow on the ground red. The nursing baby was still by the mother's side, touching the mother's chest with his hand, constantly calling for his mother. The mother's blood was on the child's body, hands, and hair, dyeing the child into a child of blood. The child was still stroking his mother; but the mother would never give him a sip of milk again...." After listening to these reports, we were very angry, and our eyes were filled with tears. But, we know that crying alone is useless. We should turn our anger into strength, and resolutely support our Volunteer Army uncles with our practical actions, and avenge those dead Korean brothers and sisters. All of our team members unanimously stated: In the future, we will listen to the teachings of our teachers in school, respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "Health First, Study Second," exercise our bodies and study hard. We must learn from the great internationalist spirit and patriotism of the Volunteer Army uncles, do a good job in anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, and strive to completely defeat the aggression of American imperialism.
  The entire members of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Squadrons of the Xiumen Elementary School Young Pioneers Team, Shijiazhuang City

　　孩子们要求打垮美帝国主义
    河北石家庄少年儿童队队员听了志愿军归国代表报告后的来信编辑同志：
    四月四日，先生领着我们去听了志愿军叔叔归国代表的报告，又亲眼看见了叔叔们的雄姿，我们非常兴奋，我们更加敬爱志愿军叔叔们。在会场上，我们把最喜爱的红领巾带到他们的脖子上，把我们的签名册与照片都献给他们留作纪念，并与他们亲切握手。但这并不能完全表达出我们对志愿军叔叔敬爱的心情。志愿军叔叔们不怕牺牲，为我们少年儿童的幸福和敌人搏斗，这是多么伟大呵！
    叔叔们报告的每一句话，都打动了我们的心灵，使我们更认识到美帝国主义的残酷。美帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌，也是我们少年儿童的死敌。志愿军叔叔李激涛说：“有一个朝鲜的妈妈，背着她可爱的婴儿，离开被美国鬼子烧毁了的家园，在路上，又被凶恶的美国鬼子残杀了。子弹由妈妈的胸膛，穿过婴儿的脊背。妈妈的血流入婴儿的胸膛，婴儿的血流入妈妈的胸膛，两人的血汇流到一起了……。”“在朝鲜的某地，有一个朝鲜的妈妈被美国鬼子枪杀后，尸体躺在血泊里，把地上的白雪染成了红雪。那吃奶的婴儿还在妈妈的身旁，用手抚摸着妈妈的胸膛，嘴里不断地喊着妈妈。妈妈的血沾在孩子的身上、手上、头发上，把孩子染成了一个血的孩子。孩子还是抚摸着妈妈；但是妈妈却永远不会再给他一口奶吃了……。”听了这些报告，我们非常愤恨，眼里都含满了眼泪。但，我们知道光哭是没用的，我们应该把愤恨变成力量，用我们的实际行动，坚决支援志愿军叔叔们，替那些死难的朝鲜兄弟姐妹们报仇。我们全体队员一致表示：今后在学校里要听从老师的教导，响应毛主席“健康第一、学习第二”的伟大号召，锻炼身体好好学习。我们要学习志愿军叔叔们伟大的国际主义精神与爱国主义精神，做好抗美援朝的宣传工作，为彻底打垮美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗。
