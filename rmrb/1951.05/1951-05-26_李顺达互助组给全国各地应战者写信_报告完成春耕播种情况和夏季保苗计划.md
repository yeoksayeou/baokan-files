　　Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team Writes to Challengers Across the Country
    Reporting on the Completion of Spring Planting and Summer Seedling Protection Plans
    The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team has successfully completed the spring planting and has formulated a summer seedling protection plan. On the 20th of this month, the entire team wrote a letter to labor models and mutual aid teams across the country who had accepted their challenge, reporting on the completion of the spring planting and their production plan for the next stage. The original letter is as follows:
    Dear labor models and working brothers of mutual aid teams across the country: After we issued a challenge to you on March 6th, guaranteeing a bumper harvest this year, we received your brotherly and enthusiastic responses, which greatly encouraged us. As of today, we have completed the sowing work on schedule. As we write this letter, all members of the team are earnestly conducting a check and evaluation of the spring cultivation. Before sowing this year, we plowed, harrowed, and raked all our land three times each. Half of the cultivated land used single-blade plows, and these new-style single-blade plows did indeed plow deeper and faster. The team improved the soil on fifteen mu of land, and all cultivated land implemented crop rotation. A "small farm" for trial breeding of improved varieties has also been established. All seeds for this year's crops are superior varieties that have been selected and disinfected with copper sulfate or warm water immersion. Each mu received 130 dan of fertilizer, which is 4 dan more than originally planned. The wheat fields have been weeded once, and 60 percent of them have been top-dressed, exceeding the original plan by 20 percent. We planted 374 trees, completing 240 percent of the plan. The first season of codonopsis pilosula planting completed 80 percent of the annual plan. We also bred six pigs and one donkey. To ensure a bumper harvest this year, our cultivation has been very meticulous. This year's spring cultivation required 170 more man-days and 85 more animal-days than in previous years. At the beginning of spring cultivation, we encountered unprecedented difficulties such as heavy spring snow and muddy cultivated land. However, thanks to the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea and the strengthened collective labor concepts of all team members, under the principles of unified planning, scientific division of labor, and rational use of labor and livestock, we gradually overcame various difficulties and completed the spring planting work, which used to take three months, in two months. In addition, this year we have also made improvements in cultivation methods, not only using new-style farm tools and insecticides, but also appropriately widening the row spacing of crops, reducing the plant spacing, and paying attention to ventilation and sunlight to ensure that crops have good growing conditions. These achievements should all be attributed to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the support of our worker brothers, the guidance of scientific workers, and the encouragement of our farmer brothers across the country.
    Now that sowing is over, summer seedling protection is also extremely important. We plan to weed the autumn seedlings three times, use improved weeding hoes and hollow hoes for weeding 50 percent of the autumn fields, and apply 925 dan of top dressing. We are constantly vigilant against the occurrence of pests and diseases, have prepared 29 jin of asphalt, and have sprayers, paying attention to removing diseased plants and ears, to resolutely ensure the victorious completion of the patriotic bumper harvest competition plan. How have your production plans been completed? We hope to hear your good news!
                          Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, all members

　　李顺达互助组给全国各地应战者写信
    报告完成春耕播种情况和夏季保苗计划
    李顺达互助组已胜利完成春耕播种，并订出夏季保苗的计划。全组于本月二十日写信向全国应战的劳动模范和互助组报告完成春耕播种的情况和他们下一阶段的生产计划。原信如下：
    各地劳动模范们和互助组的劳动兄弟们：我们在三月六日向你们提出保证今年庄稼丰产的竞赛挑战后，得到你们兄弟般的热烈应战，给了我们很大鼓舞。到今天为止，我们已按时完成了播种工作。给你们写这封信的时候，全组组员正在认真地进行春季耕作的检查和评比。今年播种前，我们全部耕地作到犁、耙、耢各三遍，半数的耕地使用单把犁，这种新式的单把犁确实耕的深、犁的快。全组有十五亩土地改良了土壤，全部耕地实行了调茬换种。试育良种的“小农场”也建立起来了。今年所有庄稼的种籽全部是经过评选的优良品种，并用王铜或温汤浸拌，进行了杀菌消毒。每亩施肥一百三十担，比原计划多四担。麦田普遍锄了一遍，其中百分之六十上了追肥，超过原计划的百分之二十。植树三百七十四株，完成计划的百分之二百四十。党参播种，第一季就完成全年计划的百分之八十。还繁殖了猪六口，驴一头。为了保证今年丰产，我们的耕作是很细致的。今年的春耕播种，比往年多加人工一百七十个，畜工八十五个。春耕刚开始，我们便遇到前所未有的春雪多、耕地泥泞等困难，但由于全组组员受到了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育和加强了集体主义劳动观念，在统一计划、科学分工、合理使用劳畜力的互助劳动原则下，我们逐步地克服了各种困难，两个月便完成了往年需要三个月的春耕播种工作。另外，今年我们在耕作方法上也有了改进，不仅使用了新式农具、杀虫药剂，而且适当加宽了作物行距，缩小了株距，注意通风透阳光，保证作物有良好的成长条件。这些成绩都应该归功于毛主席的英明领导、工人老大哥的支援、科学工作同志们的指导和全国农民兄弟们对我们的鼓动。
    现在播种虽然结束了，但是夏季保苗也是极要紧的。我们计划秋苗普遍锄三遍，百分之五十的秋田使用改良耘锄和空心锄锄草，并上追肥九百二十五担。我们时刻都在警惕病虫害的发生，准备了二十九斤柏油，还有喷雾器，注意拔除病株、病穗，以坚决保证爱国丰产竞赛计划的胜利完成。你们的生产计划完成的怎样了？希望能听到你们的喜讯！
                          李顺达互助组全体组员上
                          五月二十日
