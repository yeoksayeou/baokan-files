　　I Checked My Own Error of Parrot Fashion from the Incorrect Understanding of Wu Xun

To the Editor:
    Here, I would like to briefly talk about my past understanding of Wu Xun. When I was in middle school, I heard my teacher say: In a certain place in Shandong, there was a "righteous beggar" named Wu Xun. He suffered all kinds of hardships and begged to "promote education", helping poor children who could not afford to go to school to attend school. At that time, I thought this "righteous beggar" was really remarkable, much better than those who had money but did not "promote education"; he was truly "poor people helping poor people".
    Later, in Chongqing, I saw Mr. Tao Xingzhi also praising Wu Xun, and I felt even more that Wu Xun was indeed remarkable (because I respected Mr. Tao very much). At that time, although I felt awkward about Wu Xun begging the landlords in such a self-demeaning way, I immediately felt that in order to accomplish a cause, sometimes it was necessary to compromise and be humble. That's what "asceticism to promote education" means! Later, whenever I went to bookstores, I would always read any books about Wu Xun (naturally, they all praised him). After liberation, there appeared comic strips, biographies, and movies about Wu Xun, and my impression of him deepened.
    Recently, after reading the articles criticizing Wu Xun published in the People's Daily, I realized that my past views were wrong. I found that the reason for my error was, on the one hand, that I was just following what everyone else said and did not thoroughly study Wu Xun's character; nor did I think about what role his "promotion of education" actually played in society? This incident of simply parroting others has given me a great lesson. In the future, when I express my attitude towards something, I must conduct in-depth investigation and research, and I must never repeat such mistakes.

### 我从对武训的不正确认识中检查了自己人云亦云的错误

　　我从对武训的不正确认识中检查了自己人云亦云的错误编辑同志：
    在这儿，我想简单谈谈我过去对武训的认识。当我在中学念书时，便听老师说：山东某地一个“义丐”，名叫武训。他如何受尽千辛万苦，行乞“兴学”，帮助念不起书的穷孩子上学。当时我就认为这个“义丐”真了不起，比那些有钱不“兴学”的人真不知强到那儿去了；真是“穷人向穷人”。
    以后，在重庆，我看到陶行知先生也表扬武训，更认为武训的确是了不起（因为我是很崇敬陶先生的）。当时我虽然对武训那样向地主哀求自渎，感到蹩扭；但马上又觉得为了完成一个事业，有时委屈求全是需要的。这才叫“苦行兴学”哩！以后每去书店，凡看到有关武训的书籍（自然都是歌颂他的），总得把它看了。解放后，又出现了关于武训的连环画、传记、电影等，我对他的印象更加深了。
    最近看了人民日报所刊批判武训的文章，我才认识我过去的看法是错误的。我发现我所以错误的原因，一方面是人云亦云，没有好好地深入研究武训的为人；也没想他“兴学”到底对社会起了什么作用？从这件事情上的人云亦云，给了我很大的教训。今后我对一件事情表示态度，要经过深入的调查研究，再也不能重复这样的错误了。
