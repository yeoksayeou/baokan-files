　　"How can we lag behind after having challenged the whole country?" The members of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team encouraged each other and completed this year's spring plowing and sowing.

　　At the beginning of March, when the spring snow was just melting in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi. At noon, the mountain roads were muddy and difficult to travel, and in the morning and evening, it was frozen hard. At this time, the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team began to send fertilizer to the cultivated land. Their original plan was to apply 126 loads of fertilizer per mu, but they ended up applying 130 loads per mu; the whole team's cultivated land received a total of 11,000 loads of fertilizer. This fertilizer was carried by small donkeys and by people, with great difficulty, from the village to the high and low cultivated land in the mountains. This was much harder than farmers in the plains using carts to haul fertilizer. When delivering fertilizer, fifty-nine-year-old team member Wei Lixing, single-handedly drove two animals, and also carried a load on his shoulder, heading up the mountain before dawn. At that time, many team members' hands and faces were red and swollen because they got up too early. But this hard work paid off: the time they spent delivering fertilizer this year was halved compared to last year.

　　According to the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team's plan, this spring they would carry out the work of repairing and improving the soil on fifteen mu of cultivated land. The fifteen mu of land consisted of dozens of plots, scattered in the mountains and gullies. This project was quite large. As soon as the fertilizer was delivered, it was time to hoe the wheat fields. They assigned all the wheat fields to the women to hoe, while the men repaired the land. In order to level and repair the hillside land, they built stone walls and filled in soil, working meticulously, and did not stop even when it rained heavily. The women were the same, hoeing the wheat fields wearing bed sheets in the rain. Rainwater mixed with sweat flowed down their faces. Every day, they had to complete the day's tasks, and even exceed the day's plan before they stopped working.

　　Using new farm tools was one of the competition conditions they proposed to the national agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams. In the past, the Shanxi Provincial Labor Model Conference had awarded their entire village three new plows. These three new plows were bulky and heavy, and inconvenient to use in the mountainous terrain, so everyone was reluctant to use them. This year, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory modified these three new plows to make them lighter, but no one was still willing to use them. Li Shunda took the lead in trying them out. One day, this old hero with a strong will cracked his whip and drove the animals to plow the land with a new plow. When the black soil was turned up by the new plow, Wang Wenzhang, a team member following behind, couldn't help but exclaim: "Good tool, it plows deeper and finer than the soil plow!" Two days later, Li Shunda told everyone that he had figured out how to use the new plow. He said: "When using the new plow to plow the land, just lift the plow slightly when turning, and the turning will be very flexible. This way, it is also easy to use the new plow to plow small plots of land. The animal pulling the plow uses its left leg to turn, so it won't chafe its neck." Because the efficiency of plowing with the new plow was one-third higher than that of the soil plow, after Li Shunda's successful trial, all the farmers in the village competed to use the new plow to plow the land.

　　The days of sowing were also the most tense for the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team. During those days, some team members were so busy that they didn't get enough sleep. During sowing, the entire team made a meticulous and scientific division of labor: experienced plowmen specialized in holding the plow to plow the land, female team member Wang Buqiao drove the animals to harrow the land, and then the team's technical expert Ma Xinghai operated the seed drill (a type of sowing tool) to sow the seeds. In this way, one step closely followed another, and the entire team quickly completed the spring sowing. They planted improved varieties such as "Golden Queen" corn and "Large Yellow Hen Beak" millet. The seeds were all disinfected with warm water and mixed with copper sulfate. In order to prevent underground pests, they also used more than two thousand catties of cypress leaf powder when sowing, and put them into the ground together with the seeds.

　　Now, the autumn crops sown by the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, the green, lush seedlings have already emerged from the soil. This is the first victory they have achieved in this year's patriotic production increase campaign. During the busiest time of spring plowing and sowing, they did not forget to study, nor did they forget the war in Korea. After the "May 1st" holiday, their enthusiasm for learning was even higher. When working in the fields, they read the newspaper every time they took a break. The news of the victories on the Korean front, and the news of agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams all over the country responding to their challenge to participate in the patriotic production increase competition, constantly encouraged their patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm.

　　李顺达互助组春耕播种记
    新华社记者  马明、丰平
    “和全国挑了战还能落后吗？”李顺达互助组的组员们在互助鼓励中完成了今年的春耕和播种。
    三月初，在山西太行山里还是春雪初融的时候。午间山路泥泞难行，早晚又冻得冰硬。这时，李顺达互助组就开始往耕地里送肥料了。他们原计划每亩地上肥料一百二十六担，结果每亩上了一百三十担；全组的耕地一共上肥料一万一千担。这些肥料，是用小毛驴驮，用人挑，艰难地从村里送到山上高高低低的耕地里的。这比平原上的农民用大车拉肥料辛苦多了。送肥料的时候，五十九岁的老组员魏理兴，一个人吆喝着两条牲口，自己肩上还挑着一担，天曚曚亮就上了山。那时，许多组员因为起得太早，手和脸都冻红肿了。但这种辛苦是有代价的：他们今年送肥料所用的时间，比去年缩短了一半。
    根据李顺达互助组的计划，今年春天他们要进行十五亩耕地的整修和改良土壤的工作。十五亩地有好几十块，而且这山一块，那沟一块，很分散。这个工程实在不小。刚送完肥料，又是紧该锄麦地的时候。他们就把全组的麦地都交给妇女们去锄，男人们都修地。为了把山坡地修平修好，他们垒石垫土，精雕细刻地工作着，连下大雨的时候也不收工。妇女们也一样，下雨的时候就披着被单锄麦地。雨水混合着汗珠，从他们的脸上往下流。每天，他们一定要把当天的事作完，甚至要超过了当天的计划才收工。
    使用新农具，是他们向全国农业劳动模范和互助组提出的竞赛条件之一。过去，山西省劳动模范大会曾经奖给他们全村三具新犁。这三具新犁又笨又重，山地里使用很不便当，所以大家都不愿意使用。今年，这三具新犁由华北农业机械总厂改造得轻便些了，但是还没有人愿意用。李顺达就先来试用。有一天，这个有着坚强意志的老英雄，响起他的鞭子，赶着牲口用一具新犁耕地了。当黑色的土壤被新犁翻起来时，跟在后面的组员王文章不禁大叫起来：“好家具，真比土犁耕的又深又碎！”过了两天，李顺达告诉大家说，他已经摸到了使用新犁的窍道。他说：“用新犁耕地，在转弯的时候，只要稍稍提起犁头，转弯就很灵便。这样，用新犁耕小块的地也好使唤。拉犁的牲口用左腿转弯，就不会磨破脖子。”因为新犁耕地的效率比土犁高三分之一，所以在李顺达试用成功后，全村农民都争着用新犁耕地了。
    播种的那几天也是李顺达互助组最紧张的时候。那几天，有些组员忙得没有睡好觉。播种时他们全组作了精细的、科学的分工：耕地的老手专门扶犁耕地，女组员王补巧赶着牲口耙地，然后由组里的技术能手马兴海摇耧（一种播种的农具）播种。这样一步紧跟一步，全组很快就完成了春播。他们种的是“金皇后”玉蜀黍、“大黄母鸡嘴”谷子等优良品种。种籽都是用温汤消过毒，又用王铜药剂拌过的。为了防止地下虫害，播种时他们还用了二千多斤柏叶粉末，和种籽一齐下到地里。
    现在，李顺达互助组播种的秋禾，绿油油的茁壮的嫩苗都已经出土了。这是今年他们在爱国丰产运动中取得的第一个胜利。在春耕和播种最忙的时候，他们也没有忘掉学习，也没有忘掉朝鲜的战争。“五一”节后，他们的学习热情更高了，在地里劳动时，他们每一次歇下来就读报。朝鲜前线的胜利消息，全国各地农业劳动模范和互助组向他们应战参加爱国丰产竞赛的消息，经常鼓舞着他们的爱国热情和生产热情。
