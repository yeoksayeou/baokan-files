　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch from TASS: The Central Committee of the German Communist Party recently issued a statement, lodging a serious protest against the Bonn "government's" actions in suppressing the people's voting movement in West Germany.

　　As the people's voting movement in West Germany surges higher day by day, the Bonn "government," which had previously announced a ban on the people's vote, is resorting to terror tactics to suppress the movement. On May 23rd, police in Düsseldorf sealed off the local Free German Youth League organization. Subsequently, the Hesse state government also sealed off the local progressive newspaper, "Socialist People's News." On May 26th, the Hamburg authorities ordered the confiscation of local newspapers such as "People's News," as well as the "North German Echo" and "Democratic Forum," which were also printed in Hamburg. Furthermore, on the orders of the Bonn "Minister of the Interior," Lehr, 20,000 leaflets protesting re-militarization were confiscated, many of which were issued by branches of the Social Democratic Party and workers in Hamburg.

　　The Central Committee of the German Communist Party pointed out in its statement that the Bonn "government's" persecution is not only aimed at Communists but also at workers of the Social Democratic Party.

　　The aim of Adenauer and his masters in taking such actions is to suppress the West German people's movement against re-militarization and to establish a West German mercenary army of at least 300,000 men to serve as cannon fodder in new wars of aggression. The statement calls on all German patriots to intensify the struggle against German re-militarization and against the illegal actions of the Bonn "government." The statement said, "Resistance to the Adenauer government's blatant atrocities is the duty of every honest German."

　　The statement emphasized that despite the Bonn "government's" various acts of terror to prevent the people from holding votes, the people's voting movement is still expanding. Voting results show that over 90 percent of the people in West Germany oppose the imperialist plan to drag Germany into another world war.

　　德共中央委员会发表声明
    抗议波恩傀儡镇压人民投票运动
    号召爱国者加紧反对西德重新军国主义化
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国共产党中央委员会最近发表声明，对波恩“政府”镇压西德人民投票运动的行为，提出严正的抗议。
    由于西德的人民投票运动一天比一天高涨，以前已宣布过禁止人民投票的波恩“政府”，竟不惜采取恐怖手段来镇压这个运动。五月二十三日，杜塞尔多夫的警察查封了当地的自由德国青年联盟组织。接着，黑森州政府也查封了当地进步的《社会主义人民报》。五月二十六日，汉堡当局又下令没收了当地的《人民报》以及也在汉堡印刷的《北德回声报》和《民主论坛报》等进步报纸，并且奉波恩“内政部长”勒尔的命令，没收了二万份抗议重新军国主义化的传单，其中有许多是汉堡社会民主党各支部及工人发出的。
    德国共产党中央委员会在声明中指出：波恩“政府”的这种迫害行动，不仅是对付共产党人的，现在也是对付社会民主党的工人了。
    阿登纳和他的主子们采取这种行动的目的，就是镇压西德人民反对重新军国主义化的运动，是想要建立一支至少三十万人的西德雇佣军，来充当新侵略战争的炮灰。声明号召德国所有的爱国者，加紧反对德国重新军国主义化和反对波恩“政府”的非法行动的斗争。声明说：“抵抗阿登纳政府的公然暴行，是每一个正直的德国人的职责”。
    声明强调指出：尽管波恩“政府”以种种恐怖行为来阻止人民举行投票，但是人民的投票运动，仍在不断扩展中。投票结果显示：西德有百分之九十以上的人民都反对把德国拖入另一次世界战争中去的帝国主义计划。
