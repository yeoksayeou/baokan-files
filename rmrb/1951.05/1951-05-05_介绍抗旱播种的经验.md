Introducing Experience in Drought-Resistant Planting

　　Editor's Note: The spring plowing and sowing season is here, but most parts of North China and parts of Shandong and the Northwest have not received soaking rain. Drought-resistant planting, especially drought-resistant cotton planting, has become an urgent task. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of Hebei Province, and Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of Pingyuan Province, have personally led a large number of cadres to the countryside to lead farmers in launching a drought-resistant cotton planting campaign. However, some cadres and the masses in some areas still have the idea of "waiting for rain," and some cotton farmers have prepared two cotton planting plans, i.e., planting more with rain and planting less without rain. Therefore, if we fail to lead the farmers to carry out drought-resistant planting immediately, it will inevitably delay the agricultural season and affect the entire cotton planting plan. Here, we introduce the past experiences of various regions in leading drought-resistant planting for your reference.

  I. How to Lead Drought-Resistant Planting?

　　1. Establish the idea that "man will conquer nature" and actively mobilize the masses to fight against drought. To achieve this, we should mobilize the masses to recall the tragic facts of past famines to overcome the masses'麻痹 (ma bi) [numbness or complacency]; at the same time, use concrete accounting methods to overcome the masses' psychology of fearing difficulties; and use the masses' experience to educate the masses and stimulate their enthusiasm for fighting drought. In addition, it is also very necessary to give full play to the leading role of rural cadres, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, model workers, and activists to actively drive the masses to take action.

　　2. Organize all forces that can be mobilized and vigorously launch a drought-resistant planting campaign. Drought-resistant planting is the most urgent work. The manpower, animal power, and waterwheels of the masses have varying degrees of difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to extensively organize labor mutual aid and human-animal labor exchange, carry out well digging and water lifting, and mobilize women and children to participate in appropriate division of labor to achieve "men, women, and children all working together" and "people, animals, and tools all busy." For example, in the spring drought of 1949 in North China, Jizhong Tenth District organized more than 320,000 laborers to plant 3.29 million mu of cotton, half of which was planted by carrying water. Six young and strong women, one old man, and one old woman in Xinhua Store Village, Hejian, organized themselves to carry water by the young people, and dig pits and plant seeds by the old people, planting 39 mu of cotton, overcoming the difficulties of households lacking labor. From the vernal equinox to the beginning of summer, a village in Longjiapu, Yi County, allocated more than 4,300 workdays for men and more than 5,400 workdays for women. Not only was it ensured that planting was done in time, but also, due to diligent weeding and more fertilization, the yield per mu increased by one dou of grain. Before the organization of waterwheels in Duyanggang, Xingtang, many households without waterwheels could not irrigate their land in time. After the rational organization and use of waterwheels in the drought resistance, not only could the original 2,073 mu of irrigated land be irrigated in time, but also 398 mu of irrigated land was expanded, giving full play to the efficiency of the waterwheels.

　　3. Drought-resistant planting is a crash and mass work, so it is necessary to organize a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to take charge of districts, and conduct in-depth inspections of the masses' ideological and material preparations for drought-resistant planting. On the one hand, vigorously carry out ideological mobilization, and on the other hand, seize the opportunity to solve the water source problem. How to solve the water source problem? First of all, we must repair existing canals, wells, and waterwheels to give full play to the effectiveness of existing water conservancy; at the same time, we should widely carry out mass movements to repair small canals and dig soil wells according to local conditions. This kind of small-scale water conservancy does not require much labor (generally, three, four, or six or seven workdays are enough to dig a soil well), and it is effective quickly (if water is carried to plant seeds, a soil well can supply water for more than ten to twenty mu of land, even if it is enough to irrigate five or six mu of shady land). It is easily accepted by the majority of farmers. During the spring drought in North China the year before last, Jizhong mobilized 14,000 cadres, and Jinan mobilized 4,000 people to go deep into the countryside to mobilize the masses to build water conservancy. A total of 150,000 soil wells were dug in the region, irrigating 2 million mu of land, and successfully completing the task of planting cotton and peanuts.

  II. Drought-Resistant Planting Methods for General Crops

　　1. Tillage Methods: To prepare for drought-resistant planting, dry land should be harrowed and mulched more to make the soil fine and maintain moisture. Irrigated land should be prepared with furrow ridges and embankments. Once it is time to plant, immediately start planting seedlings in shady areas.

　　2. Drought-Resistant Spot Planting: Spring crops such as cotton, peanuts, corn, sweet potatoes, and potatoes have wide row spacing and fewer plants, so spot planting does not require much labor. For example, for cotton, calculated at about 2,000 holes per mu, one mu of land requires about 40 to 50 dan of water, and one or two laborers can plant one mu in a day. There are generally several types of spot planting methods:

　　(1) Pit Planting: First, use a furrow opener to open ditches, dig holes according to the ditches, about three inches deep, water the holes according to the holes, and when the soil is moderately moist (when the soil particles can be crushed without stickiness when tested with fingers), sow the seeds immediately, cover with about one inch of moderately moist soil, and then cover with a layer of dry loose soil to reduce moisture dissipation.

　　(2) Seam Planting: First, rake away the dry soil, place the soaked seeds on the moist soil, press the soil, and then cover it with a layer of dry soil. The sun only shines on the dry soil, and the seeds germinate and grow in the moist soil. In 1949, Chicheng County, Chahar, used this method to dry plant 50,000 mu in ten days, and the yields were all 80%.

　　(3) Planting Using Light Rain: Dig the holes first, and after a light rain, concentrate the surface moist soil in the holes and carry out spot planting. This is a method similar to the drought prevention tillage method of "attacking dry ditches" created by Lu Hongbin, a model worker in Shandong. Lu's method is to plow equidistant dry ditches during tillage, and after a two-finger rain, immediately plant and cover the moistened fine soil on both sides of the dry ditches, which is equivalent to the effectiveness of a four-finger rain.

　　In some areas, organic matter is used as base fertilizer during spot planting, and sorghum stalks are crushed after being soaked in water and placed under the seeds to maintain moisture and prolong drought resistance time. No matter which method is used, warm water soaking of seeds must be carried out during spot planting, which can not only reduce pests and diseases, but also promote seed germination.

  III. Drought-Resistant Cotton Planting Methods

　　1. Soil Removing Planting Method: This is to shovel away the top layer of dry soil and sow the cotton seeds in the lower layer of moist soil. The casing ploughing method in the southern cotton area of ​​Hebei Province is a very good soil removing planting method. The casing ploughing method is also called "cutting dry and planting wet." This method is most suitable for planting on land with three inches of dry soil on the surface. First, tie broken shoe soles or straw bundles, soil deflectors, etc. to the iron ploughshare of the cotton plough or ordinary hoe (some use weeding hoes). The position and size of the binding are adjusted according to the thickness of the dry soil on the ground. When the dry soil is thick, the straw bundle or soil deflector should be raised and widened. After tying it up, test it to make sure it is suitable. Then use it to cut the ditches, divide the dry soil on both sides, expose the moist soil, and quickly sow the seeds on the moist soil with a single-leg plough, but do not cover the dry soil when covering the soil. After the seeds are sown, roll and compact them with a stone roller, or use a rope to pull bricks or push a hoe to compact them. The masses of cotton farmers in Jixian and Nangong areas of Hebei Province are very skilled in using the casing ploughing method for planting. In 1949, most of the cotton fields in these areas were planted using this method, and the seedlings emerged neatly.

　　2. Deep Sowing and Thick Covering Soil Planting Method: This method was taught by Yu Luoshan, a model worker in southern Hebei. The plough should plough deeply, and the seed-leaking port of the plough leg should be wrapped with galvanized iron sheet (kerosene barrel iron sheet), or plastered with yellow mud. This can lengthen the seed-leaking pipe and move the seed-leaking port down to make the cotton seeds spread deeper (limited to sowing in moist soil). Then cover the soil with a wooden pull stick (or broken roof tile), and the thickness of the soil cover should be more than three fingers. After sowing, check the cotton seeds planted in the ground every day after three or five days according to the weather changes. When they germinate and take root, tie hemp rope, broken shoes, broken cloth, straw bundles, etc. to the plough leg at a depth of two fingers, and lightly cut the surface soil two fingers deep on the ridge ditch, dividing the dry soil on both sides to make it easier for seedlings to emerge. Using this method for planting is not only drought-resistant, but also not afraid of rain hardening the soil after sowing. However, it must be meticulous and thorough: the sowing depth must be consistent, the ridges must be straight, and the depth of soil cutting to help seedlings emerge must be uniform. Cutting too deep will easily destroy the seedlings, and if it is too shallow, the seedlings will not easily emerge. Before using this method, practice a few more times and start after you are sure.

　　3. Foreign Soil Planting Method: Also known as "borrowing soil for planting": It is best to dig deep holes for spot planting. First, shovel away the top layer of dry soil and sow the cotton seeds in the moist soil. Dig another hole next to it, shovel away the dry soil and take out the moist soil in it to cover the cotton seeds to increase the moisture needed for cotton seed germination. You can also cover the moist soil and then cover it with a layer of dry soil to reduce moisture evaporation, and then remove the dry soil before the cotton seedlings emerge.

　　4. Watering Spot Planting Method: Although this method is more labor-intensive, it is drought-resistant and can ensure that the cotton seedlings emerge evenly. It can be used in places with well water, river water nearby, or high groundwater level, where soil wells can be temporarily dug. The method is to first dig holes in the field, and then carry water by hand to water and spot plant at the same time. Sow about five or six seeds in each hole. Each kerosene bucket of water can water seven or eight holes. The sown seeds should be scattered and not squeezed together to avoid the seedlings from lifting the soil block and ventilating when they germinate together; moreover, in order to save labor, the holes should not be dug too sparsely, reducing the number of plants per mu, resulting in a reduction in harvest.

　　5. Seedling Protection and Replanting Method: "Seeing seedlings is three-tenths of the harvest." Seedlings must be protected and replanted if there are missing seedlings. There are two ways to protect seedlings: One is watering the seedlings. The water-saving method for watering seedlings is to scrape away a layer of surface soil beside the seedlings with a hoe, and cover it with dry soil after watering. In the past, the Jiluyu Border Region created a method of using a two-foot-long and one-inch-wide wooden stick with one end sharpened. Insert a six- or seven-inch-deep hole about two or three inches beside the planted seedlings, and pour water into it with a pot. After the water seeps in, cover it with soil. Generally, 20 dan of water per mu is enough to water the seedlings. The second is weeding the seedlings. This method is common and easy to implement. The saying "Three-tenths of water under the hoe" is because weeds are removed to avoid absorbing moisture from the soil, and after hoeing, the soil capillaries can be cut off, making the soil finer and preventing moisture from dissipating easily. When hoeing, pay attention to hoeing shallowly around the seedlings to avoid hurting the roots, as more roots can absorb moisture. At the same time, it is best not to hoe at noon to avoid excessive evaporation.

　　As for replanting: In dry weather, many seedlings do not emerge evenly, which will inevitably reduce the harvest. If replanting, the seedlings will emerge late and mature unevenly, so it is best to replant seedlings. During the spring drought of 1949, farmers in Sanhe County, Hebei Province, created the "cotton bed seedling raising method," which is to first turn the soil six inches to make a bed, spread a layer of manure, turn it over again, sow the seeds, cover the soil one inch thick and flatten it with your feet. Water it twice on the same day, and the seedlings will emerge in three or four days. After the seedlings have emerged, remove the bad seedlings. When the seedlings are about four or five inches high with small leaves growing on the two cotyledons at twenty-five or six days, they can be transplanted into the ground. When planting, just like planting eggplant seedlings, first dig a pit on the cotton ridge, apply manure and water, and then seal the soil.

　　介绍抗旱播种的经验
    编者按：目前春耕播种季节已到，但华北大部地区和山东、西北部分地区，尚未获得透雨，抗旱播种，尤其是抗旱植棉，已成为当前紧迫的任务。河北省杨秀峰主席、平原省罗玉川副主席均已亲自率领大批干部下乡，领导农民发起了抗旱种棉运动，但有些地区的干部群众，仍存在着“等雨”的思想，有些棉农准备了两个植棉计划，即有雨多种，无雨少种。因此，如果不能领导农民立即进行抗旱播种，势必耽误农时，影响整个植棉计划。这里特将已往各地领导抗旱播种的经验，加以介绍，以供研究。
  一、怎样领导抗旱播种？
    １、要树立“人定胜天”的思想，积极发动群众向旱灾作斗争。为了作到这一点，应发动群众回忆过去灾荒的悲惨事实，来克服群众的麻痹思想；同时用具体算账的办法，来克服群众畏难的心理；并以群众的经验，教育群众，启发群众抗旱的积极性。此外，充分发挥农村干部、党员、团员、劳动模范、积极分子的带头作用，积极带动广大群众行动起来，也是很必要的。
    ２、组织一切能够动员的力量，大力展开抗旱播种运动。抗旱播种是一个最紧迫的工作，群众的人力、畜力和水车等工具，都有不同程度的困难，因而必须广泛地组织劳动互助、人畜变工，进行挖井戽水，并发动妇女儿童参加，进行适当的分工，做到“男女老幼齐动手”“人畜工具三不闲”。如一九四九年华北各地春旱，冀中十分区组织了三十二万余劳动力，抗旱种棉三百二十九万亩，其中一半是经过担水点种的。河间新华店村六个青壮妇女，一个老头，一个老大娘组织起来，年青的担水，年老的挖坑点种，种棉三十九亩，克服了缺乏劳力户的困难。易县龙家铺一个村从春分到立夏，男的共拨工四千三百余个，女的共拨工五千四百余个，不仅保证及时种上，而且由于勤锄苗多施肥，每亩增产了一斗粮。行唐独羊岗当水车未组织前，有许多没水车户不能及时浇地，在抗旱中把水车组织合理使用后，不仅原有二千零七十三亩水浇地能及时浇水，而且还扩大了三百九十八亩水浇地，充分发挥了水车的效能。
    ３、抗旱播种，是一个突击性又是一个广大群众性的工作，必须组织大批干部力量投入农村分区负责，深入检查群众对抗旱播种的思想准备和物质准备，一面大力进行思想动员，一面抓紧解决水源问题。如何解决水源问题呢？这首先要修整现有渠道、水井、水车，充分发挥现有水利的效能；同时应根据地区条件，广泛地开展群众性的修小渠、打土井运动。这种小型水利，费工不大（一般地区三、四个或六、七个工即可打土井一眼），收效迅速（一眼土井如果挑水点种，可供周围十余亩到二十亩地用水，即使浇水阴地也够五、六亩地之用。）易为广大农民所接受。前年华北各地春旱时，冀中曾动员干部一万四千人，冀南动员四千人深入农村，发动群众兴修水利，全区共打土井十五万眼，浇地二百万亩，胜利的完成了点种棉花和花生的任务。
  二、一般农作物的抗旱播种法
    １、整地方法：为作好抗旱播种的准备，旱地要多打耙擦盖，使土壤细碎，保持水分。水浇地要做好轮沟畦堰，一到种植时，立即动手阴地按苗。
    ２、抗旱点种：棉花、花生、玉蜀黍、红薯、马铃薯等春季作物，因株行距宽，棵数少，点种费工不大。如棉花挖穴点种，每亩以二千穴左右计算，一亩地需水量约四、五十担，一两个工一天即可点种一亩。点种的方法，一般有下列几种：
    （１）挖穴点种：先用耠子开沟，依沟挖穴，穴深约三寸，依穴灌水，待土壤湿润适度时（以手指试探至土粒可粉碎而无黏性时）即下种，上覆以湿润适度的土约一寸，然后再覆上干碎土一层，以减少水分发散。
    （２）接墒播种：先搂开干土，把浸过的种子，放在湿土上，把土按上，然后再在上面盖一层干土，太阳只晒干土，种子在湿土里发芽生长。一九四九年察哈尔赤城县采用这种方法，在十天当中，干种了五万亩，收成均有八成。
    （３）利用小雨播种：先挖好穴，在小雨后即将表层湿土集中于穴中，实行点种。这是和山东劳动模范吕鸿宾所创造的“攻干沟”的防旱整地办法相仿的办法。吕的办法是在整地时犁起等距的干沟，待下了二指的小雨后，随即种上，并将两旁干沟上润湿的细土加盖上去，便等于四指雨的效能。
    有的地区，在点种时用有机质作底肥，并用秫秸等压过铡碎用水泡透后，搁在种籽底下，借以保持水分，可延长抗旱时间。不论采用那一种方法，在点种时，一定要进行温汤浸种，不仅可以减少病虫为害，更可促进种籽发芽。
  三、棉花的抗旱播种法
    １、揭土播种法：就是把上层的干土铲去，把棉籽播在下层的湿土里。河北省南部棉区有一种套耧播种法，就是很好的揭土播种法。套耧法又叫“豁干耩湿”，在有三寸上下的干土的土地上用此法播种最为适宜。先在耩花耠子（即种棉用的单腿耧）或普通劐子（有的用耘锄）的铁铧上方绑上破鞋底或草把、分土板等。绑的位置和大小按地表干土的厚薄来调节。干土厚的时候草把子或分土板就应加高加宽。绑好后经试验合适。就先用它豁沟，把干土分在两旁，露出湿土，并赶快在湿土上用单腿耧播种，但覆土时不可把干土盖上，种子播下后再用砘石磙镇压一次，也可用绳拉砖或推锄去镇压。河北省冀县、南宫一带种棉花的群众使用套耧法播种都很熟练，一九四九年这些地区的大部棉田都用此法播种，出苗都很齐整。
    ２、深播厚覆土播种法：这个方法是冀南劳动模范郁洛善讲的。耧要深耩，把耧腿的漏籽口往下用洋铁片（煤油桶的铁皮）包扎，或用黄胶泥砌抹，这样能加长漏籽管把漏籽口往下移，使棉籽撒得深些（以播到湿土里为限）。然后用木拉棍（或破车瓦）覆土，覆土的厚度要在三指以上；播种后按天气的变化，三日或五日后每天检查播在地里的棉籽，到发芽扎根的时候，把耧腿按二指深浅绑上麻绳、或破鞋、破布、草把等物，在垅沟上轻轻的把表土豁开二指深，将上面的干土分向两旁，使幼苗容易出土。使用这个方法播种不但抗旱，还不怕播种后遇雨砸硬地皮。但必须精细周到：播种的深度要一致，垅行要直，帮助出苗豁土的深浅更要均匀，豁深了容易摧毁幼芽，浅了幼苗不易出土。使用此法前，要多练习几次，有了把握再动手。
    ３、客土播种法：又叫“借土播种”：最好是挖深穴点播，先将上层干土铲去，把棉籽播种在湿土上；另在旁边挖一穴，铲去干土取出其中湿土覆盖在棉种上，以增加棉籽发芽所需的水分，还可以覆湿土后再盖上一层干土，减少水分的蒸发，俟棉苗出土前再将干土揭去。
    ４、浇水点播法：此法虽比较费工，但是耐旱，且能保证使棉苗出齐。在附近有井水、河水或地下水位较高，能临时挖土井的地方都可使用。办法是先在田里挖好穴，然后用人工挑了水来一面浇一面点种。每穴播种约五、六粒籽，每一煤油桶水可浇七八个穴。播下的种籽要散开，不可挤在一起，以免一齐发芽时顶起土块透风；更不可为了省工挖的穴太稀，减少每亩株数，以致使收获量降低。
    ５、保苗补苗法：“见苗三分收”，必须有苗保苗，缺苗补苗。保苗的办法有二：一是浇苗。浇苗省水的办法，是在苗傍用锄刮开一层表土，浇水后覆盖干土。过去冀鲁豫边区曾创造一种方法，用二尺长一寸宽的木棍，一端削尖，在点种的小苗傍约二、三寸许处，插下六、七寸深的窟窿，用壶把水灌进去，待水阴下以后，再用土盖上，一般每亩有二十担水即够浇苗。二是锄苗。这种办法普通易行。俗语“锄头底下三分水”，就是因为把草锄掉，免得吸收地里的水分，而经过锄铲之后，又可割断土壤毛细管，使土壤变细，湿气不易发散。在锄时应注意小苗浅锄，不要伤根，根多可以吸收水分。同时，最好中午不锄，以免蒸发过大。
    至于补苗：天旱时有许多苗出不齐，必然要减少收成，要是补种，小苗出的晚，成熟不一，因此最好是进行补苗。一九四九年春旱时，河北三河县农民创造出“棉花打畦育苗法”，就是先翻土六寸做成畦，铺粪一层，再翻一遍，播上种籽，盖土一寸厚用脚踩平，当日连浇两次水，三、四天即出苗，苗出齐后，把坏苗拔去，到二十五、六天时，待两个瓣子上长出小叶约四、五寸高时，即可移植地里，栽时就像栽茄秧一样，先在棉垄上刨好坑，使粪浇水后封土即可。
