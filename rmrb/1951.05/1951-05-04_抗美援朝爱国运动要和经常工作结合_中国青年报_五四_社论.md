　　Combine the Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Movement with Regular Work
    ——*China Youth Daily* "May Fourth" Editorial
    Today is the 32nd anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the China New Democratic Youth League. Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth have consistently inherited and promoted the patriotic spirit of the May Fourth Movement against imperialism, and now they are also standing at the forefront of the Chinese people's Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. Today, as we commemorate "May Fourth," we must, in the spirit of this glorious tradition, further develop the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement.
    Currently, the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement has been widely launched throughout the country. This movement, except in some areas where it has not yet been launched and still needs to be popularized, generally needs to be further deepened. How can we further deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement? That is to closely integrate the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement with our regular work, so that the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement becomes regularized and continuously gains vivid and rich content, and at the same time, our practical work gains momentum, enabling us to express our determination to resist America, aid Korea, and love our motherland through the performance of our practical work.
    Once the patriotic movement is combined with regular work and life, it has practical content, achieves practical results, and at the same time, it can further develop this movement. This is to link the masses' immediate demands, daily life, and national interests together, making the mobilization of the masses more universal and in-depth. For example: We combine the work of mobilizing the masses to pay public grain well with the propaganda and education of Resist America, Aid Korea patriotism. Every household has to pay public grain, and the principles of Resist America, Aid Korea patriotism are firmly remembered in every household's heart. Conversely, if the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement is not combined with the masses' regular work and life, this movement will gradually become detached from the broad masses. The masses see the movement as a blitz, generating the idea of "waiting for the movement," and after this "movement" is over, they "wait" for the next "movement"; or they regard the movement as something for the cadres, waiting for the cadres to start it before participating. It is necessary to hold patriotic actions such as denunciations and parades. Many people have raised their political awareness after participating in denunciation meetings and parades, and there are still many places that need to hold denunciation and other actions. However, patriotic actions are not limited to this. Moreover, denunciations and parades cannot be done frequently. Even for actions such as denunciations and parades, they should be combined with practical work as much as possible. For example, in rural areas after land reform in new areas, when carrying out the large-scale production movement, denouncing why production was not done well before, and proposing how to treat production now, turns grief and indignation into strength, and the denunciation does not fall flat.
    Our regular work combined with the patriotic movement also has political significance, has a clear purpose, and can mobilize everyone to consciously do the regular work better, thus making the patriotic movement truly play a role. Everyone works, produces, and studies for the sake of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending the motherland, and building the motherland, for the interests of the country and the people. Purely for personal gain cannot increase our courage and sense of responsibility in our work. On the contrary, not caring about personal gains and losses, and working wholeheartedly, will make us invincible and insurmountable. Because everyone sees that all the achievements, big and small, are part of the country's great achievements; they will all be inspired by this achievement, and thus work even harder. Just like many workers in factories and students in schools, understanding that the concrete manifestations of resisting America, aiding Korea, and loving the motherland are to do a good job in production and study, and to strengthen their bodies, they are determined not to be lazy anymore and not to be afraid of difficulties anymore. They heard the speeches of the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, heard that the People's Volunteer Army defeated the enemy in the freezing cold for the sake of the motherland, and therefore felt that if they were slack in the rear, they would be letting down the People's Volunteer Army.
    Combining the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement with regular work means that in factories, it should be combined with patriotic production competitions; in rural areas, it should be combined with patriotic production (bumper harvest) movements; and in schools, it should be combined with new democratic study. The Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement should promote production and study, and the propaganda of Resist America, Aid Korea patriotism should be linked to specific work tasks and production tasks, rather than being detached from them or hindering them. The mobilization of regular work should be linked to Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda, so that it has political significance. The Xin Zhuangzi Mine of Huainan Coal Mine put forward the slogan "The coal mine is the battlefield, the tools are the knives and guns" in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, held denunciations against American and Japanese imperialism, and carried out patriotic education for Resist America, Aid Korea. As a result, from February 17th to 25th, five new records appeared in nine consecutive days. In schools, in addition to necessary extracurricular activities, the main thing is to implement Resist America, Aid Korea education into various subjects and combine it with curriculum reform.
    For the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement to be regularized and combined with regular work, it is also necessary to conduct regular and systematic patriotic political education. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement has unprecedentedly raised the political awareness of the people and youth of the whole country. In order to consolidate this awareness, the revolutionary enthusiasm that has been aroused must be transformed into regular political education on current affairs. Not only must regular political education on current affairs be conducted for students in schools, but also for all young workers, young farmers, and other patriotic youth. Without systematic political education, propaganda work will lose its soul, and it will be impossible to raise the political awareness of the people. We young people must aspire to become conscious workers and conscious soldiers, so we must study hard. As we look back on the revolutionary history since the May Fourth Movement and look forward to the infinitely bright future of socialist and communist society, we should inherit the excellent anti-imperialist and patriotic tradition since "May Fourth," work hard to serve the country and the people, and strive to thoroughly complete Mao Zedong's cause!

### 抗美援朝爱国运动要和经常工作结合——中国青年报“五四”社论

　　抗美援朝爱国运动要和经常工作结合
    ——中国青年报“五四”社论
    今天是五四运动的三十二周年纪念日，也是中国新民主主义青年团成立两周年纪念日。五四运动以来，中国青年一贯地继承与发扬了五四运动反对帝国主义的爱国精神，在现在也是站在中国人民抗美援朝运动的前列。我们今天纪念“五四”，要本着这个光荣传统，进一步地开展抗美援朝爱国运动。
    目前抗美援朝爱国运动在全国各地已经广泛地开展。这个运动，除在有些未开展的地方尚需普及外，一般地是要进一步地深入。怎样进一步深入地开展抗美援朝爱国运动呢？那就要使得抗美援朝爱国运动和我们的经常工作密切地结合起来，那样就使得抗美援朝爱国运动经常化并不断获得生动丰富的内容，同时也就使得我们的实际工作获得推动力，使得我们能够以实际工作的表现来表示我们抗美援朝热爱祖国的决心。
    爱国运动一经与经常工作、生活相结合，就有了实际内容，收到实际效果，同时又可以使得这个运动进一步地开展起来。这就是把群众的切身要求、日常生活和国家利益联系起来，使得发动群众更为普遍与深入。譬如：我们把发动群众交好公粮的工作与抗美援朝爱国的宣传教育结合了起来，每一家都要交纳公粮，抗美援朝爱国的道理便牢记在每一家的心里。相反地没有把抗美援朝爱国运动和群众的经常工作、生活结合，就会使得这一运动逐渐与广大群众脱节。群众把运动看成是突击式的，产生了“等运动”的思想，这个“运动”过去了，再“等待”下一个“运动”；或是把运动当成是干部们的事情，等待干部们搞起了再来参加。举行控诉、游行等爱国行动是必要的，很多人参加了控诉会和游行以后提高了政治觉悟，在目前仍然有许多地方要举行控诉等行动。但爱国行动不是只限于此。而且控诉、游行不能经常去做。即使是控诉、游行等行动，也应当尽可能地结合实际工作，如新区经过土地改革后的农村，在开展大生产运动时，进行控诉为什么以前生产搞不好，而提出现在应该怎样对待生产，就使得悲愤化为力量，控诉不致于落空。
    我们的经常工作和爱国运动结合了起来，也就有了政治意义，有了明确的目的，就能动员大家自觉地把经常工作做得更好，因而使爱国运动真正发挥作用。大家工作、生产、学习，都是为了抗美援朝、保卫祖国、建设祖国，为了国家、人民的利益。单纯为了个人，并不能使我们在工作中增加勇气和责任感，恰恰相反，不计较个人得失，全心全意地工作，就会无敌不摧、无坚不克。因为大家都看到了一切大小的工作成绩，都是国家的伟大的成就的一部分；就都会受到这一成就的激励，因而更加做好工作。就像很多工厂里的工人、学校里的学生，了解到抗美援朝、热爱祖国的具体表现就是要搞好生产、学习，练好身体，就决心不再偷懒，不再害怕困难。他们听到了中国人民志愿军代表的讲演，听到人民志愿军为了祖国，在冰天雪地中战胜了敌人，因而感到如在后方懈怠，就对不起人民志愿军。
    抗美援朝爱国运动和经常工作结合，就是说，在工厂里，要和爱国主义生产竞赛相结合；在农村里，要和爱国生产（丰产）运动相结合，在学校里，要和新民主主义学习相结合。要使得抗美援朝爱国运动来推动生产和学习，要使得抗美援朝爱国的宣传与具体的工作任务、生产任务联系起来，而不是和它们脱节或妨碍它们。要把经常工作的动员和抗美爱国宣传联系起来，使它具有政治的意义。淮南煤矿新庄子矿场就是在抗美援朝运动中，提出了“煤窑当战场，工具当刀枪”的口号，举行对美、日帝国主义的控诉，进行抗美援朝的爱国教育，于是从二月十七日到二十五日九天中接连出现五个新纪录。在学校里，除了必要的课外活动外，主要地是把抗美爱国的教育贯彻到各种功课中去，并与课程改革结合起来。
    抗美援朝爱国运动要经常化，要和经常工作结合，还必须进行经常的系统的爱国主义政治教育。抗美援朝运动已经使全国人民和全国青年的政治觉悟空前地提高了，为了巩固这个觉悟，就必须把已经激发起来的革命热情，转入经常的时事政治教育。不但对于在学校里的学生必须进行经常的时事政治教育，而且对于所有的青年工人、青年农民和其他的爱国青年，也都必须进行这种教育。没有系统的政治教育，将使宣传工作失去灵魂，将不可能提高人民的政治觉悟。我们青年们要立志成为一个自觉的工作者，自觉的战士，就必须要努力学习。我们回顾从五四运动以来的革命史实，并展望今后无限光明的社会主义、共产主义社会前途，我们就应继承“五四”以来的反帝爱国的优良传统，努力为国家为人民服务，为彻底完成毛泽东事业而奋斗！
