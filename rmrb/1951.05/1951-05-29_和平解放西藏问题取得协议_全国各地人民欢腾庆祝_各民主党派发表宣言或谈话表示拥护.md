  The Capital
    On the night of the 27th, the people of the capital heard the news from the radio that an agreement had been reached on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and were all greatly encouraged. Teachers, students and staff of many schools, such as the Mongolian and Tibetan School, as well as some citizens, went to the streets to publicize the good news. Students of the Central Institute for Nationalities shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" in twenty-five different ethnic languages. Miao students played the lusheng; Uyghur students played the dap (hand-beaten leather drum) and shook the sapa ya and dutar tangberjian (hand-cranked instruments). Propaganda teams from the Hui Nationality College and the Yuhua Middle School were all dispatched. When the Beijing Railway Station's broadcaster announced the news of the victory, everyone at the station rejoiced.
    Tibetan lamas and students in Beijing were even more excited. Ba De·Zhong Xiu Sheng, a Tibetan student at the Central Institute for Nationalities, carefully read the full text of the agreement in Tibetan and said repeatedly, "Extremely good!" They pledged to study hard and go to Tibet in the future to serve their fellow countrymen.
    On the 28th, many factories, schools, government organs, and people's organizations, such as the Shijingshan Power Plant, the People's Printing Plant, Fu Jen Catholic University, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, held celebrations. People from all walks of life unanimously praised the great victory of Chairman Mao's national policy, further strengthening their confidence in the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and liberating Taiwan. Li Jinquan, a national labor model from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said, "The Tibetan people, who have suffered for many years from the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, can only be liberated under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. We must step up production and devote all our strength to accelerate the liberation of Taiwan."
  Tianjin
    After the news of the agreement reached on the peaceful liberation of Tibet spread to Tianjin, the people of the city were extremely excited.

Dong Yanbin, a labor model from Hengyuan Textile Factory, woke up more than twenty fellow workers to promote the news on the streets. Many workers at the factory proposed striving for full attendance in June and resolutely eliminating accidents to celebrate this great victory.

Under the leadership and assistance of the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people will implement regional autonomy and move forward steadily. They will certainly establish brotherly, friendly, and mutually helpful relations with other ethnic groups in the country, and develop Tibet's economy and culture, and build a democratic and prosperous new Tibet."

The first to appear was the workers' procession. Then students and citizens poured in from all directions to the city center to celebrate and dance wildly, even more lively than the Lantern Festival night. Wang Hengkui, an eighty-year-old man, said: "Under the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the adjacent Xikang and Tibet were never united. Today is the first time in my eighty years, and it is also what my ancestors hoped for." More than 200 workers from the Sichuan-Kang Engineering Team who are about to go to the Kangzang Plateau unanimously stated that they would redouble their efforts to repair the roads, so that the People's Liberation Army could reach Tibet as soon as possible, defend the border, and help the Tibetan brothers build a new and better life.
  Luzhou
    The people of Luzhou in southern Sichuan, who had actively supported the People's Liberation Army's march into Tibet, warmly celebrated the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. After the Southern Sichuan Daily issued an extra edition at 6:00 p.m. on the 27th, the sound of gongs and drums and firecrackers immediately rang out throughout the city. Tens of thousands of workers, shop assistants, and students promoted the news everywhere and held torch parades. Citizens flocked to pay tribute to the families of soldiers marching into Tibet.
    [Further News] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the headquarters of the China Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers’ Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Beijing office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, yesterday issued declarations or made written statements through spokespersons to celebrate the agreement reached on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. All democratic parties unanimously pointed out that this historic agreement marks the complete bankruptcy of the imperialist conspiracy to invade Tibet for more than a century. This is another great victory for Chairman Mao's national policy. All democratic parties cheered for the Tibetan people's return to the big family of friendly cooperation of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, and cheered for the victorious unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country.
    A spokesperson for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated: "The Chinese Tibetan ethnic issue, which has not been resolved for hundreds of years, has reached an agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet due to the wise and correct leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, and the awareness of those in charge of the Tibetan local government. This is another unprecedented event in Chinese history; it is also a joyous event of unprecedented unity among the Chinese nation. First of all, we should express our warm congratulations and pay our highest respects to our leader, Chairman Mao!
    We know that the disunity between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and the disunity within the Tibetan ethnic group in the past were the evil consequences of the reactionary Manchu Qing government, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek government's rule and oppression, and the evil consequences of all kinds of provocations and divisions by imperialism invading Tibet. After the great victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause, imperialists and their lackeys more frantically carried out conspiracies, attempting to separate the Tibetan people and people from the motherland. Fortunately, Chairman Mao's great national policy aroused the love and belief of the Tibetan people, and the Tibetan local authorities successively accepted the Central People's Government's call for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and sent representatives to Beijing to hold negotiations, and the peaceful agreement demonstrating the great national policy was concluded. From then on, the Tibetan people will forever get rid of the aggression and shackles of imperialism and return to the big family of loving cooperation of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, and devote themselves to the development of politics, economy, and culture on the basis of unity. This is really the happiness of the Tibetan people and the happiness of all the Chinese people.
    A spokesperson for the headquarters of the China Democratic League pointed out: This agreement "fully embodies the correctness and success of our Common Program's national policy. The articles not only stipulate the Tibetan people's right to implement ethnic regional autonomy, but also take care of the actual needs of the Tibetan people and their local government." "The people of all ethnic groups in China should unite more closely under the banner of Mao Zedong, and strive to guarantee the thorough implementation of this agreement and consolidate the victory of the motherland."
    After analyzing the various provisions in the agreement, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Construction Association said: "From this agreement, we can see that our Central People's Government's national policy is truly an equal policy; the help to fraternal ethnic groups is truly selfless help." "This is the most typical example of Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought in dealing with ethnic issues. The signing of this agreement will inevitably bring epoch-making changes to the Tibetan ethnic group and the relationship between the Tibetan ethnic group and the motherland, and bring a bright and happy future to the Tibetan ethnic group and the Tibetan people. It will also give a fatal blow to the British and American imperialists who are conspiring to separate our Tibetan ethnic group from the motherland."
    The statement issued by the China Association for Promoting Democracy said that the signing of this agreement "is not only a victory for the Tibetan compatriots, a victory for all the Chinese people, but also a victory for all peace-loving people in the world." "We wholeheartedly thank the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao."
    The statement issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party said: "The signing of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet eliminated the ethnic estrangement created by the reactionary Manchu Qing government, the Chiang Kai-shek government, and imperialism, brought epoch-making changes to the history of the Tibetan nation's relationship with the motherland, and brought a bright, equal, free, and happy future to the Tibetan nation and people." This "is another great victory for the great unity of the Chinese people's revolution, another great victory for the Chinese people against imperialist aggression, and the most valuable achievement that the national policy under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party has provided to all ethnic groups in China."
    The declaration of the China Zhi Gong Party pointed out: Imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang used all despicable means to obstruct and sabotage the movement of the Tibetan nation to return to the motherland. "Now, thanks to the success of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the conspiracy of imperialism and the reactionaries has been completely crushed. This fact shows that only under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party can all ethnic groups in our country unite and create their own happiness and light."
    The written statement issued by the Jiusan Society said: "We wholeheartedly support the government's wise measures that conform to the interests of the Tibetan people and therefore also conform to the interests of all the Chinese people." "We call on the members of the Jiusan Society to assist the Tibetan compatriots in developing their culture, education, science, economy, and national defense as much as possible in their cultural, educational, and scientific work posts. We must also further strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and step up preparations for the liberation of Taiwan."
    After congratulating the Tibetan compatriots and the Chinese people on this great victory, a spokesperson for the Beijing Office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League pointed out: "The internal unity of the Tibetan nation is the main factor for the Tibetan people to move towards prosperity and happiness, and it is the ardent hope of the people of the whole country; it is hoped that the personnel of both sides of Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni will abandon their past grievances from now on, unite closely, and strive to build a new Tibet." Finally, he expressed that while warmly celebrating the agreement reached on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, "we are full of confidence that Taiwan must be liberated. We are determined to work harder and work together with the people of the whole country for the liberation of Taiwan."

    中国国民党革命委员会发言人发表谈话称：“几百年来没有解决的中国西藏民族问题，由于中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席英明正确的领导，和中国人民解放战争的胜利，以及西藏地方政权主持者的觉悟，已经成立关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。这是中国历史上又一空前的大事；也是中国民族空前团结的喜事。首先我们应当表示热烈的庆祝，并向我们的领袖毛主席致崇高的敬意！
    我们知道过去汉族和西藏民族间的不团结以及西藏民族内部间的不团结，是反动的满清政府、北洋军阀和蒋介石政府统治压迫所造成的恶果，也是帝国主义侵入西藏种种挑拨离间所造成的恶果。中国人民解放事业取得伟大胜利后，帝国主义及其走狗们更疯狂进行阴谋的勾当，企图使西藏民族和人民脱离祖国。所幸毛主席的伟大民族政策引起了西藏民族的爱戴和信仰，西藏地方当局相继接受中央人民政府和平解放西藏的号召派遣代表来京举行谈判，而表现伟大民族政策的和平协议遂得告成。从此西藏民族永远脱离帝国主义的侵略和羁绊，回到中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作的大家庭来，在团结的基础上致力于政治、经济、文化各方面的发展。这真是西藏人民的幸福，也是全中国人民的幸福。
    中国民主同盟总部发言人指出：这一协定“充分体现了我们共同纲领的民族政策之正确与成功。条文不但规定了西藏人民有实行民族区域自治的权利，同时照顾了西藏人民及其地方政府的实际需要。”“中国各民族的人民应愈加亲密团结在毛泽东旗帜之下，为保证这一协议的彻底执行和巩固祖国的胜利而努力。”
    民主建国会发言人分析了协议中的各项规定之后说：“从这个协议中可以看出：我们中央人民政府的民族政策真正是平等的政策；对于兄弟民族的帮助真是无私的帮助。”“这是马列主义毛泽东思想在民族问题处理上最典型的范例。这个协议的签订，必然给予西藏民族以及西藏民族与祖国的关系，带来划时期的变化，给与西藏民族和西藏人民带来光明和幸福的前途。更给与阴谋分离我西藏民族与祖国关系的英、美帝国主义以致命的打击。”
    中国民主促进会发表的文告中说，这次协议的签订，“不仅是西藏同胞的胜利，全中国人民的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。”“我们衷心感谢伟大毛主席的英明领导。”
    中国农工民主党中央委员会发表的文告中说：“关于西藏和平解放办法的签订，消除了反动的满清政府、蒋介石政府以及帝国主义所制造的民族间的隔阂，给西藏民族和祖国关系的历史带来了划时期的变化，给西藏民族和人民带来了光明、平等、自由、幸福的前途。”这“是中国人民革命大团结的又一伟大胜利，是中国人民反对帝国主义侵略的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席、中国共产党领导下的民族政策提供给中国各民族的最宝贵的成果。”
    中国致公党的宣言中指出：帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮曾用尽一切卑劣手段，阻挠和破坏西藏民族回到祖国的运动。“现在，由于和平解放西藏协议的成功，把帝国主义和反动派的阴谋，粉碎无遗了。这一事实说明了只有在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的民族政策领导之下，我国各民族才能团结，才能创造出自己的幸福与光明。”
    九三学社发表的书面谈话中说：“我们衷心拥护政府这种符合西藏人民利益因而也符合全中国人民利益的贤明措施。”“我们号召九三学社的社员在文教科学的工作岗位上，尽量协助西藏同胞发展文教、科学、经济、国防等事业。我们还要进一步加强抗美援朝运动，加紧解放台湾的准备工作。”
    台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处发言人在祝贺西藏同胞与中国人民的这一伟大胜利之后指出：“西藏民族的内部团结，是西藏人民走向繁荣、幸福的主要因素，是全国人民的热望；深望达赖喇嘛先生和班禅额尔德尼先生两方的人员自此弃尽前嫌，紧密团结起来，为建设新西藏而奋斗。”最后，他表示：在热烈庆祝和平解放西藏问题获得协议的同时，“我们满怀着信心，台湾一定要解放。我们誓要更加努力，和全国人民一道为台湾解放而努力”。
