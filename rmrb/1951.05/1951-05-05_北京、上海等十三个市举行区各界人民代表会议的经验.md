　　Experiences of Beijing, Shanghai, and Thirteen Other Cities in Holding District People's Representative Conferences

Recently, thirteen cities including Beijing have held district people's representative conferences. All districts in six cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, Harbin, and Zhangjiakou, have held these conferences. The Twelfth District of Beijing's suburbs held a people's representative conference and also exercised the functions of a district people's congress, electing the district people's government committee. Guangzhou has universally held the third people's representative conference in each district. Districts in Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanjing, Jinan, and Chengdu have also successively held people's representative conferences.

The experience of various places in holding the conferences proves that it is very necessary for districts in cities with populations of over 100,000 to convene district people's representative conferences.

First, people from all walks of life in the cities have this demand. People submit many important issues related to their vital interests to the district people's representative conferences for discussion and resolution. The first conferences in the nine urban districts of Beijing received a total of 21,410 proposals. The first conferences in the thirty districts of Shanghai received a total of 29,329 proposals. Other cities' district people's representative conferences also received many proposals. The content of the proposals mainly concerned residents' welfare issues and improvements in cadres' work style. It is often impossible to resolve these issues one by one at the municipal people's representative conferences. At the same time, holding district people's representative conferences gives people more opportunities to participate in politics and more fully exercise their power. Beijing's nine urban districts alone had 1,434 representatives (approximately three times the 519 representatives of the Municipal Third People's Representative Conference). Shanghai's thirty districts had a total of 6,021 representatives (approximately ten times the 600-plus representatives of the Municipal First People's Representative Conference). Almost all larger factories, enterprises, schools, streets, and neighborhoods elected representatives, allowing the opinions and demands of people from all walks of life and all social strata to be reflected to the municipal and district people's governments through their representatives, enabling the government to unite all the people to work together to promote work.

Second, district people's representative conferences more closely connect the municipal and district people's governments with the citizens, thereby mobilizing the people more extensively and deeply to carry out various construction tasks. When the Beijing Municipal People's Government formulated the 1951 municipal construction plan, it sought the opinions of the citizens at the Second District People's Representative Conference in advance, enabling the municipal and district people's governments to better understand the people's demands and make municipal construction more in line with the needs of the people. Through the district people's representative conferences, the broad masses of citizens also gained a better understanding of the work of the People's Government. Some representatives from Beijing's districts said: "Before, I only knew that the People's Government was doing things for the people, but I didn't know it was doing so many things." Some representatives from Wuhan's Wuchang District said after the meeting: "I now know that the government has done so much work in more than a year, with one cadre doing the work of several people. The People's Government is truly dedicated to serving the people."

Cities that have held district people's representative conferences have seen better progress in various tasks compared to before. Previously, tasks assigned by the municipality to the districts were difficult to implement due to the shortage of district cadres. However, after the representatives discussed and adopted resolutions at the district people's representative conferences, and the representatives led the masses to implement them after the meetings, various tasks could be carried out smoothly. The first conferences of the Second, Fourth, and Tenth Districts of Tianjin focused on deeply developing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement and strengthening winter defense work. Not only were resolutions made and covenants established, but residents of the Second District held a demonstration parade against America and aiding Korea just two days after the meeting. The First Conference of the Third District of Beijing resolved to handle 206 proposals, and eventually completed 204 of them. The First and Seventh Districts organized housing repair committees after the meetings, with representatives assisting the government in mobilizing the people to repair 5,622 houses, accounting for 85 percent of the houses that needed repair in the two districts. In this way, various tasks are handled by the people themselves, which is several times more powerful than the efforts of a few cadres. Therefore, some cadres in Tianjin said: "We have only one experience with district people's representative conferences, which is that they were held too late."

Based on the experience of the above cities in holding district people's representative conferences, the following points should be noted to ensure the success of the conferences:

　　One, a preparatory committee must be established before the meeting, and various symposiums must be held to organize people from all walks of life to jointly prepare for the meeting. In this way, the district people's government can prepare issues for discussion and formulate work plans based on the people's true opinions.

　　Two, representative elections. All cities have paid attention to the broad representation of representatives, but the methods of producing representatives are not entirely the same. In Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other cities, in addition to representatives from agencies, troops, and groups being elected or recommended independently, regional representatives are elected by every few dozen households as residents' representatives, and then several residents' representatives jointly produce a district representative through consultation.

　　Three, collecting and sorting proposals. The district people's proposals in various cities are numerous, wide-ranging, and complex. Collecting and sorting proposals is a very heavy task and a crucial part of ensuring the success of the conference. Generally, cities combine propaganda and elections, and collect proposals from the masses through representatives and activists among the residents. The Fourth District of Beijing's experience in organizing various forces to sort out proposals is very good. The district divided the proposals into seven categories according to their nature, invited 75 representatives to cooperate with the preparatory committee in sorting them out, and invited people from relevant departments of the municipal and district governments to participate. In this way, it is possible to better determine the handling methods of proposals based on policies and specific circumstances. The representatives who participated in sorting out the proposals explained the proposals that could not be handled to the masses, so the masses understood the government's difficulties, and the results were very good.

　　Four, how to conduct the meeting. In addition to discussing the government's work report and major work issues proposed by the government, the content of the meeting generally focuses on solving several residents' welfare issues in a targeted manner according to specific circumstances. Before the Second Conference of each district in Beijing, Peng Zhen, Chairman of the CPPCC of the Municipal People's Representative Conference, gave a report to all district representatives on the content and spirit of the conference, so that everyone had a unified understanding and clear thinking, and the conference was held relatively well. Holding more small meetings and fewer large meetings saves time and is suitable for the situation of district people's representative conferences, which need to solve many specific and trivial problems. It is better to combine occupations and regions when dividing into groups. When discussing regional issues, group by region; when discussing various occupational issues or preparing for elections, group by occupation. The conference methods are generally simple and unadorned. Individual districts copied the form of the provincial and municipal people's representative conferences, and the representatives felt uncomfortable speaking.

　　Five, post-conference communication. People want to know the outcome of even the smallest issues they raise, whether they are resolved or not. Beijing's experience is that specific issues must be answered specifically. Wuchang's experience is that issues should return to where they came from. The CPPCC of the Fourth District of Beijing formulated a communication plan and a communication outline. Some representatives fully recorded the progress of the meeting, the results of the proposals, and the key points of the communication in their notebooks. This way, the communication will be good.

### 北京、上海等十三个市举行区各界人民代表会议的经验

　　北京、上海等十三个市举行区各界人民代表会议的经验
    最近全国已有北京等十三个市举行区各界人民代表会议。北京、广州、上海、重庆、哈尔滨、张家口等六个市的各区都已开过。北京市郊第十二区各界人民代表会议并代行区人民代表大会的职权，选举了区人民政府委员会。广州市各区已普遍举行第三次各界人民代表会议。天津、沈阳、武汉、西安、南京、济南、成都等市的各区，也相继举行各界人民代表会议。
    各地举行会议的经验证明，十万人口以上的城市的区召开区各界人民代表会议，是非常需要的。
    首先，城市各界人民有这种要求。人民把许多关系切身利益的重要问题，提交区各界人民代表会议讨论和解决。北京市九个城区的第一次会议共收到提案二万一千四百一十件。上海全市三十个区的第一次会议共收到提案二万九千三百二十九件。其他城市的区各界人民代表会议，收到的提案也都很多。提案内容以居民福利问题和改进干部作风问题为多。这些问题往往不可能在市各界人民代表会议上逐一解决。同时，区各界人民代表会议的举行，使人民得到更多参政机会，更加充分地行使自己的权力。北京市仅九个城区的代表即有一千四百三十四人（约当市第三届各界人民代表会议代表五百一十九人的三倍）。上海全市三十个区的代表共六千零二十一人（约当市第一届各界人民代表会议代表六百余人的十倍）。较大工厂、企业、学校、街道、里弄，差不多都选出代表，使各行、各业、各个阶层人民的意见与要求通过自己的代表，反映给市、区人民政府，使政府得以团结全体人民一致努力去推动工作。
    其次，区各界人民代表会议更加密切了市、区人民政府与市民群众的联系，从而能更广泛深入地动员人民进行各项建设工作。北京市人民政府拟定一九五一年市政建设计划时，由于事先在第二次区各界人民代表会议上征集市民群众的意见，使市、区人民政府更加了解了人民的要求，并使市政建设更符合了人民的需要。通过区各界人民代表会议，广大市民群众也更了解了人民政府的工作。北京市有的区代表说：以前我光知道人民政府是给人民办事的，但不知道办了这么多的事。武汉市武昌区有的代表在会后说：我才知道政府一年多做了这样多的工作，一个干部当几个人用，人民政府真是忠心给人民办事的。
    已举行区各界人民代表会议的城市，各项工作较前好推动了。以前，市交给区办的工作，因为区干部少，较难贯彻下去，但是在区各界人民代表会议上，经过代表讨论并作出决议，会后代表带动群众执行，各项工作就能顺利地展开。天津市第二、四、十等区第一次会议以深入开展抗美援朝运动、加强冬防工作为中心议题，不仅作出了决议，订立了公约，第二区居民群众在会后两天就举行了抗美援朝示威游行。北京市第三区第一次会议决议要办二百零六件提案，后来竟完成了二百零四件。第一、七两区在会后由代表组织房屋修缮委员会，协助政府动员人民修理了五千六百二十二间房屋，占该两区应修房屋的百分之八十五。这样，各种工作由人民自己来办理，比少数干部的力量大过几倍。因此，天津市有些干部说：我们对于区各界人民代表会议只有一条经验，就是开得太迟了。
    根据以上城市举行区各界人民代表会议的经验，开好会议应注意以下几点：
    一、会前须要成立筹备委员会，并举行各种座谈会，组织各界人民共同进行会议的准备工作。这样，区人民政府才能根据人民的真实意见准备要讨论的问题，拟定工作计划。
    二、代表选举。各城市都注意到代表的广泛性，但是产生代表的方法却不完全一样。在北京、天津、重庆等市，除机关、部队、团体等代表自行选举或推选外，区域代表是每数十户选举一名居民代表，再由十数个居民代表用协商方法产生一个区代表。
    三、搜集整理提案。各城市的区民提案都很多，并且范围很广，内容复杂、具体。搜集和整理提案，是一个极繁重的工作，也是决定开好会议的重要的一环。各城市一般是结合宣传、选举，通过代表和居民中的积极分子向群众搜集提案。北京市第四区组织各种力量整理提案的经验很好。该区将提案按性质分为七类，邀请代表七十五人协同筹委会共同整理，并请市、区政府有关部门派人参加。这样就能较好地根据政策和具体情况决定提案处理办法。不能办的提案，由参加整理提案的代表向群众解释，使群众明了政府的困难，反映很好。
    四、会议开法。会议内容除讨论政府工作报告和政府提出的重大工作问题之外，一般都按照具体情况有重点地解决若干居民福利问题。北京市各区第二次会议前，市各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席彭真对全市区代表作了关于会议内容和精神的报告，使大家认识一致，思想明确，会议开得都比较好。多开小会，少开大会，节省时间又适合区各界人民代表会议解决具体琐碎问题多的情况。小组划分以职业和地区相结合的方法为好。讨论区域性问题时，按地区分组；讨论各种不同职业问题或酝酿选举时，按职业划分。会议方式一般做到简单朴素，个别区搬用省、市各界人民代表会议的形式，代表感觉说话不便。
    五、会后传达。人民对自己提出的那怕是很小的问题，不论办了办不了，都要求有个下落。北京的经验是具体问题必须具体答复。武昌的经验是问题从那里来就回到那里去。北京市第四区各界人民代表会议协商委员会订出传达计划和传达纲领，有的代表把会议经过、提案处理结果、传达要点等，全记在本子上。这样传达得就好。              （新华社）
