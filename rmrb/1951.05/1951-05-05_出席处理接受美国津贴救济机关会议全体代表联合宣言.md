　　Joint Declaration of All Representatives Attending the Conference on Handling Relief Agencies Receiving U.S. Subsidies

　　We, the entire body of representatives attending the "Conference on Handling Relief Agencies Receiving U.S. Subsidies," convened by the Committee for Handling Relief Agencies Receiving U.S. Subsidies of the State Council of the Central People's Government, after listening to and discussing the reports by Comrade Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council, and Comrade Xie Juezai, Director, and Comrade Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General, of the Committee for Handling Relief Agencies Receiving U.S. Subsidies, unanimously express our heartfelt support for the government's decision and handling methods regarding the handling of relief agencies receiving U.S. subsidies.

　　For over a century, imperialists, especially U.S. imperialists, have used all sorts of methods to invade China, among which the most vicious and insidious is invasion under the guise of relief. After draining the blood of the Chinese people through political oppression, economic exploitation, and cultural deception, imperialists then take out a little money for "relief" to buy people's hearts. Moreover, the relief efforts they run in China are essentially a crime. Recently, the people of Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, and other places have exposed the orphanages and charitable halls run by imperialists in our country. Due to utterly irresponsible management, extremely poor nutrition, and failure to treat illnesses or random treatment, countless innocent infants in our country have died tragically. The infant mortality rate at the Guangzhou Sacred Infant Nursery even reached as high as 98 percent, and the lowest rate in other places was over 60 percent. The very few children who were fortunate enough to survive were, under the enslaving education of imperialist elements, instilled with anti-Soviet, anti-communist, pro-American, and worshipful-of-America ideas, and taught to be hostile to their parents and ignorant of their motherland. They were also beaten, scolded, starved, and frozen, and made to do hard labor beyond their physical capabilities. These ironclad facts make us realize the true purpose of imperialists in running "relief" and "charitable" undertakings in China. Of course, part of the source of American relief subsidies also comes from many devout Catholics and Christians who save on food and clothing and donate their labor income to the Catholic and Christian churches in China, hoping to do some good in China. They never dreamed that most of their donations would be pocketed by some imperialist pawns with "angelic faces and wolfish hearts"—nuns and mumu. These nuns and mumu-like fellows eat their fill in China until their faces are glowing, wear fine and soft clothing, and live in luxurious houses. Their daily "merit" is to intentionally or unintentionally kill countless Chinese infants who cannot complain, and to instill extremely reactionary ideas in Chinese children, cultivating many American slaves.

　　Most of the Chinese personnel engaged in relief and welfare work originally wanted to do some good deeds, but due to objective and subjective reasons, erroneous viewpoints and confused thoughts once existed. For example, there was insufficient understanding of the power of the people of the motherland, and there was more or less a notion of relying on "foreign aid"; moreover, it was also believed that engaging in relief and welfare work was a "supra-political" job, and some even had some concerns about the People's Government. Now, because we have participated in collective and individual political studies, and because we have witnessed the great achievements of the People's Government in various aspects of politics, economy, and culture over the past year or so, we have come to know and understand the great power of the liberated new Chinese people. During the conference, we listened to the educational reports of the leaders, and we heard the tearful accusations of many brothers and sisters who had suffered persecution by imperialist elements; this has elevated our political understanding a step further. We have learned that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, and we have also learned that the People's Government and the broad masses of people are sincerely supporting our relief undertakings, helping us to thoroughly eliminate the aggressive influence of U.S. imperialism, and ensuring that our relief and welfare undertakings can continue to be carried out, and that they will definitely be carried out better than before.

　　In addition, the wounds of war in China have not yet healed, and U.S. imperialism is carrying out a war of aggression in Korea. China's peaceful construction has just begun, and U.S. imperialism wants to expand its aggression and undermine our construction. Which outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation can tolerate this? We, the relief and welfare workers engaged in peaceful construction, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's rearming of Japan, oppose the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan, and oppose U.S. imperialism's violent acts of aggression against Taiwan and Korea and undermining world peace. Therefore, we hereby express our determination to our compatriots across the country and to the people of the world:

　　1. Support the People's Government, support the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao, support the State Council's "Decision on the Policy of Handling Cultural and Educational, Relief, and Religious Organizations Receiving U.S. Subsidies" and the "Implementation Measures on Handling Relief Societies and Relief Organizations Receiving U.S. Subsidies" proposed at this conference, resolutely reject U.S. subsidies, sever all ties with U.S. imperialism, and rely on our own people to run the people's relief and welfare undertakings well.

　　2. Unite the relief and welfare circles across the country, work hard to study, widely carry out patriotic propaganda and education, improve political and professional levels, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression.

　　3. Popularize and deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, support all the resolutions and declarations of the World Peace Council and the China People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, support the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, provide relief to Korean refugees, and are determined to make redoubled efforts to defend the security of the motherland and defend world peace.

　　One hundred and eighteen representatives attending the Conference on Handling Relief Agencies Receiving U.S. Subsidies.

### 出席处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议全体代表联合宣言

　　出席处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议全体代表联合宣言
    我们出席中央人民政府政务院处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会召集的“处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议”的全体代表，在会上倾听了并讨论了政务院文化教育委员会郭沫若主任和处理接受美国津贴救济机关委员会谢觉哉主任、伍云甫秘书长的报告以后，一致表示对政府处理接受美国津贴救济机关的决定及处理办法衷心拥护。
    百余年来，帝国主义者尤其是美国帝国主义者用各种各样的方式、方法来侵略中国，其中最毒辣、最阴险的一种是借救济的名义来进行的侵略。帝国主义者经过政治压迫、经济榨取、文化欺骗，抽干了中国人民的血液以后，又拿出一点点钱来进行“救济”，收买人心。而且，他们在中国所办的救济事业，实质上是一种罪行。最近，广州、南京、北京和其他地方人民揭露了帝国主义者在我国举办的育婴堂、孤儿院、仁慈堂，由于管理毫不负责，由于营养极端不良，由于有病不治或乱治，使我国成千成万的无辜婴孩悲惨地死去了，其中广州圣婴育婴院的婴儿死亡率竟高达百分之九十八，其他各地最低也在百分之六十以上。极少数幸而不死的孩子，也在帝国主义分子的奴化教育下，养成反苏反共，亲美崇美，敌视父母，不知祖国的思想；他们还得挨打，挨骂，挨饿，挨冻，作着体力不能胜任的苦工。这些铁的事实，使我们认识到帝国主义要在中国举办“救济”、“慈善”事业的真正目的。当然，美国救济津贴的来源有一部分也出于许许多多虔诚的天主教徒、基督教徒，他们节衣缩食，把劳动所得，捐献给中国的天主教会、基督教会，想在中国做些好事。他们做梦也没有想到他们的捐款大部分被一些“天使其貌，豺狼其心”的帝国主义爪牙——修女、姆姆中饱自肥。这些修女、姆姆之类的家伙，在中国吃得满面红光，穿得细软耀目，住在华丽的房子里，她们日常的“功德”就是有意无意地害死无数不能诉苦的中国婴儿，就是对中国儿童灌输极端反动的思想，养成很多美国洋奴。
    从事救济福利的中国工作人员大多数原想做些善举，但是由于主客观原因，曾经存在了错误观点，糊涂思想。如：对祖国人民的力量认识不足，或多或少有依赖“外援”的念头；并且，还认为从事救济福利事业是“超政治”的工作，有的对于人民政府还有些顾虑。现在，由于我们参加了集体的，个人的政治学习，由于我们眼见人民政府一年多来在政治、经济、文化各方面的伟大成就，我们认识了解放了的新中国人民的伟大力量。在会议进行期间，我们听到了各位首长富有教育意义的报告，听到了许多亲受帝国主义分子迫害的弟兄姊妹声泪俱下的控诉；使我们的政治认识提高一步。我们知道了美帝国主义是中国人民的死对头，也知道了人民政府与广大人民正在真诚支持我们的救济事业，帮助我们彻底肃清美帝国主义的侵略影响，保证我们的救济福利事业能够继续办下去，而且一定能够办得比以前好。
    此外，中国战争创伤尚未痊愈，美帝国主义又在朝鲜进行侵略战争，中国和平建设刚刚开始，美帝国主义又想扩大侵略，破坏我们的建设，中华民族的优秀儿女谁能容忍？我们从事和平建设的救济福利工作者，坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，反对美国单独对日媾和，反对美帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜，破坏世界和平的狂暴行为。因此，我们谨向全国同胞和全世界人民表示我们的决心：
    一、拥护人民政府，拥护毛主席所领导的中国共产党，拥护政务院“处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”和在此次会议及提出的“关于处理接受美国津贴的救济社团及救济机关实施办法”，坚决拒绝美国津贴，割断与美帝国主义的一切联系，依靠人民自己，来办好人民救济福利事业。
    二、团结全国救济福利界，努力学习，广泛进行爱国主义宣传教育工作，提高政治与业务水平，彻底肃清美帝国主义文化侵略的影响。
    三、普及和深入抗美援朝运动，拥护世界和平理事会及中国人民抗美援朝总会所有的决议与宣言，支援中朝人民部队，救助朝鲜难民，决心为保卫祖国安全与保卫世界和平而加倍努力。
    出席处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议全体代表一百一十八人。
              一九五一年四月三十日
