　　Agricultural Labor Model Jiang Shanjiang Reports
    Expanding Cotton Planting in Jiangxi Pengze Lin's Hometown

To the Editor:

    Land reform in my township (Linjia Township, Second District, Pengze, Jiangxi) is nearing completion, and the peasants are all celebrating their liberation. In order to improve production, labor mutual aid groups are being organized in various villages, and supply and marketing cooperatives are being developed (with over 300 members already). We have also contacted the People's Bank to secure loans for purchasing water pumps, etc.

    Our five townships in Jiangbei, Pengze, are cotton-producing areas. As the saying goes, "Plant early cotton before the Beginning of Summer." Currently, we are quickly repairing the embankments and promoting land preparation among all the farmers in the township, preparing to plant cotton early. In order to respond to the People's Government's call for planting more cotton, we plan to plant almost all the land in the cotton-producing area with cotton.

    The dike repair project this spring in the three townships adjacent to my township—Getiao, Liangfu, and Yongjing—is very large-scale, so we organized more than 200 migrant workers to help them build it. Everyone says, "Farmers of the world are truly one family."

　　农业劳动模范江善讲来信报告
    江西彭泽鳞家乡扩大种棉编辑同志：
    我乡（江西彭泽二区鳞家乡）土地改革快完成了，农民都欢庆自己翻了身。为了搞好生产，现各村正在组织劳动互助组，发展供销合作社（社员已有三百多），我们并和人民银行取得联系，要贷款买抽水机等。
    我们彭泽江北五乡为产棉区。俗语说：“立夏前，种早棉，”目下我们正赶快修圩堤，并推动全乡农民翻地，准备早种棉花。为了响应人民政府多种棉的号召，在产棉区准备把绝大部分的地都种上棉花。
    和我乡邻近的搁挑、粮富、永京等三个乡，今春修堤工程非常浩大，因此我们就组织了二百多个民工，去帮他们修筑。大家都说，天下农民真是一家了。
