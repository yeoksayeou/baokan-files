Minority Areas Launch Literary and Artistic Activities to Resist America and Aid Korea

The Northwest Cultural Troupe, the Northwest Military Region Cultural Troupe, and others, crossed the Gobi Desert and grasslands to conduct propaganda activities of resisting America, aiding Korea, and patriotism in various minority areas of Ningxia, Qinghai, and other provinces. The famous Uyghur dancer, Kambarkhan, also performed in Xi'an, which was very popular among the masses.

In the propaganda movement, various forms of literary and artistic propaganda teams, such as Yangko teams, amateur bands, social fire teams, and amateur theater troupes, have developed in cities and villages. In Hami County, Xinjiang alone, more than 20 Yangko teams were formed by people of all ethnic groups in the course of current affairs propaganda. In Xining City, a total of 34 units participated in the Spring Festival literary and artistic propaganda, including more than 2,000 literary and artistic workers from Hui, Tibetan and other ethnic groups. Due to mutual observation in propaganda activities, the performance forms and contents of literary and artistic work in the Northwest have been improved. The grand songs and dances of the Tibetan people in various places have largely increased the new content of patriotism. Border minority dances have also been widely adopted by various Yangko teams. The "Northwest Great Construction Dance" of the Ningxia Provincial Cultural Troupe and the "Yalu River" new-style opera of the Northwest Military Region Cultural Troupe are all creations that have absorbed the dance forms and singing tunes of various ethnic groups. The rich folk art forms of all ethnic groups, such as "small carts," "equestrianism," and "dry boats," have become powerful propaganda weapons.

Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Launch Literary and Artistic Creation Movement to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries

Since Shanghai launched the propaganda campaign to suppress counter-revolutionary activities, the opera circles have actively cooperated and used literary and artistic forms to conduct propaganda and education for the citizens. At present, most of the new operas being performed are themed on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, such as Yong Opera "Demon Revealing Mirror," Yue Opera "Yiguandao," comic opera "Living Bodhisattva," Peking Opera "Fifteen Episodes of Water Margin," drama "From Ghost to Man," and street ballad "Emperor Dream," etc., which are generally welcomed by the audience.

On April 28, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles held an enlarged creation forum, attended by more than 100 writers, literary and art workers, film and drama directors, etc., including Ke Lan, Xu Jie, Zhou Xinfang, Liu Housheng, Chen Baichen, Xiong Foxi, Lv Fu, Liu Canglang, etc. They discussed the launch of a literary and artistic creation movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and initially put forward various literary and artistic creation plans. The opera circles reported to the forum on the situation and experience of formulating a plan to create operas to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and challenged other departments of the literary and art circles. Writers and workers in literature, drama, film, music, art and other departments have shown a high degree of political enthusiasm, and have proposed guarantees to complete the task of suppressing counter-revolutionary creations in mid-May.

Beijing Stores' Window Displays Promote Resistance to America and Aid Korea

The window displays of larger stores in Beijing that promote resistance to America and aid Korea have gradually become more lively, and some are appropriately combined with their own industries, making them more distinctive.

The Xinhua Bookstore's window displayed pictures of "Records of Japanese Aggression," selecting specific examples to depict the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in China, attracting the attention of many viewers. Renli Industrial Company hung a carpet woven with a map of China, with many "Aid" characters pinned at the places equivalent to major cities, and many red lines leading to Beijing, the capital of the people, indicating that the people from all over the country are concentrating their efforts to start from Beijing to aid Korea. The Beijing branch of China Department Store used plywood to make models of cadres and spies. The cadre carried a real briefcase, and the spy tried to steal the secret documents in his briefcase, reminding everyone to be vigilant against the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries. In the window of Huaying Pharmacy, a clay sculpture of a wounded volunteer soldier with a leg injury was placed, and two Chinese and Korean medical staff were bandaging his wound, with red mercury and other medicines placed next to him. In the glass ornaments of Dong'an Market, there are now also images of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the warmonger Truman holding an atomic bomb. The wholesale department of the Beijing branch of China Department Store used many soap bars to build a US military bunker. On the US military position, lay some shameful corpses of those who were cannon fodder for Wall Street, and two American soldiers were crawling out of the bunker to raise their hands and surrender. These window displays that promote resistance to America and aid Korea are worth promoting.

　　国内文艺动态
    少数民族地区开展抗美援朝文艺活动
    西北文工团、西北军区文工团等，曾越过戈壁、草原，深入宁夏、青海等省的各少数民族地区进行抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传活动。维吾尔族名舞蹈家康巴尔汗，也曾在西安进行宣传演出，极受广大群众欢迎。
    在宣传运动中，各种形式的文艺宣传队伍，如秧歌队、自乐班、社火班和业余剧团等，都在城市和乡村中发展起来了，仅新疆哈密一县，各族人民在进行时事宣传中，即成立了二十多个秧歌队。西宁市在参加春节文艺宣传的共三十四个单位，其中回、藏等民族的文艺工作者就有二千余人。由于宣传活动中的相互观摩，使西北各民族的文艺工作表演形式和内容都得到改进，在各地藏民的盛大歌舞中已大部增加了爱国主义的新内容。边疆少数民族的舞蹈也普遍为各秧歌队所采用，宁夏省文工团的“西北大建设舞”，西北军区文工团的“鸭绿江”新型歌剧，都是吸取了各民族的舞蹈形式与演唱曲调后的创作。各民族的丰富的民间文艺形式，如“小车”、“马术”、“旱船”等都成为有力的宣传武器。
  上海文艺界开展镇压反革命文艺创作运动
    上海自从展开了镇压反革命活动的宣传以来，戏曲界积极配合，用文艺形式对市民进行宣传教育，目下上演的新戏曲中，有大部分是以镇压反革命为主题的，其中如甬剧《照妖镜》，越剧《一贯道》，滑稽剧《活菩萨》，京剧《十五集水泊梁山》，话剧《从鬼到人》，街头曲艺《皇帝梦》等，一般都获得广大观众的欢迎。
    四月二十八日上海文联创作推进委员会召开了扩大创作座谈会，到会的有作家、文艺工作者、影剧编导等一百余人。其中有柯蓝、许杰、周信芳、刘厚生、陈白尘、熊佛西、吕复、刘沧浪等。他们讨论了开展镇压反革命的文艺创作运动，初步提出各种文艺的创作计划。戏曲界向座谈会报告了制订创作镇压反革命戏曲计划的情况和经验，并向文艺界其他各部门提出挑战。文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术等部门的作家和工作者，都表现了高度的政治热情，纷纷提出保证要在五月中完成镇压反革命的创作任务。
  北京市商店宣传抗美援朝的橱窗装置
    北京市较大商店宣传抗美援朝的橱窗装置，已逐渐显得生动活泼，有的并和自己的行业适当结合，更具特色。
    新华书店的橱窗里布置了《日寇暴行录》图画，选择具体实例描绘出日寇在华暴行，引起很多观众的注视。仁立实业公司挂了一幅织着中国地图的地毯，在相当于各大城市的地方，订了许多“援”字，用许多红线引向人民的首都北京，表示各地人民集中力量，从北京出发援助朝鲜。中国百货公司北京分公司用三夹板做出干部和特务的模型，干部手提一只真的皮包，特务企图偷他皮包内的秘密文件，提醒大家应随时警惕反革命份子的阴谋。华英药房的橱窗内，用泥雕塑了一个腿部负伤的志愿军，两个中朝医务人员正在为他包扎伤部，旁边放着红汞等药品。东安市场用玻璃做的小摆设里，现在也有了英勇的中国人民志愿军和战贩杜鲁门手持原子弹的形象。中国百货公司北京分公司批发部，用许多香皂砌成了美军碉堡。在美军阵地上，躺着一些可耻的给华尔街做了炮灰的尸首，有两个美国兵正从碉堡里钻出来举手缴械投降。这些宣传抗美援朝的橱窗装置，是值得推广的。
