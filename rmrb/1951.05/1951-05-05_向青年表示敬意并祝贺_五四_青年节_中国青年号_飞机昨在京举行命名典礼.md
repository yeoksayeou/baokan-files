　　向青年表示敬意并祝贺“五四”青年节
    “中国青年号”飞机昨在京举行命名典礼
    【新华社四日讯】“中国青年号”飞机今日在北京机场举行命名典礼。这是一架中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会民航局作为对中国青年及“五四”青年节的献礼的飞机。
    参加典礼的有中央军委总政治部副主任萧华，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬、副书记蒋南翔，军委民航局局长钟赤兵，以及首都的海陆空军、工人、学生、机关干部代表等六百余人。来北京参加国际学联执委会会议的各国代表，也应邀派遣代表参加了这个盛典。
    会上首由蒋南翔致词，他说：“中国青年号”的诞生，是民航局全体职工对祖国的一个重大贡献。全国青年及青年团员都将把民航局职工们热爱祖国财产和克服困难的精神作为榜样。萧华在致词中勉励中国青年要把航空事业掌握在自己手里，为发展祖国的航空事业而奋斗。钟赤兵在讲话中说明修建“中国青年号”飞机，是借以表示对伟大的中国青年的敬意与对“五四”青年节的祝贺。国际学联的代表乔吉娃也在会上致辞祝贺。
    典礼完毕后“中国青年号”在祖国首都绕空飞行，向首都青年祝贺青年节。
    按“中国青年号”飞机的前身，是一架被国民党反动派所遗弃的破烂不堪的Ｃ——４７型飞机。经军委民航局华东办事处机械修理工厂全体职工的艰苦努力，克服物质上与技术上的困难，进行了彻底的大翻修，终将死机复活。现该机机身崭新，性能良好，可安全飞行七千小时。
