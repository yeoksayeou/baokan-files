　　Emphasize Summer Fertilization Work
    Economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco, in addition to the base fertilizer applied during spring sowing, also require top dressing in the summer to achieve a bumper harvest and increased production. After supplying fertilizer in the spring, cooperatives in various regions should continue to pay attention to and vigorously carry out summer fertilization work. Cooperatives in various regions have indeed achieved great success in supplying fertilizer for economic crops in the spring. However, upon inspection, there are still cases where farmers have used too little base fertilizer due to untimely supply or other reasons. According to inspections in Xinxiang and Liaocheng Special Districts of Pingyuan Province, many cotton fields in newly planted cotton areas have not been fertilized with base fertilizer. In Xiaqu Village, Wuzhi County, out of 420 mu of cotton planted, only 20 mu were fertilized with base fertilizer.
    Based on these situations, when carrying out summer fertilization work, it is necessary not only to calculate the general fertilizer requirement, but also to thoroughly check the spring fertilization situation to understand where too little fertilizer was applied and where no fertilizer was applied, so as to make necessary remedies in summer fertilization. Some areas have prepared more summer fertilizer than needed and should allocate some to areas with insufficient supplies. Some areas (such as the tobacco area of Henan) have not prepared enough summer fertilizer and should immediately organize forces to purchase it as soon as possible to avoid delaying agricultural time and causing reduced production.

### 重视夏季供肥工作

　　重视夏季供肥工作
    棉、麻、烟叶等经济作物，除春播时需要施用底肥外，还应在夏季施用追肥，以达到丰收增产。各地合作社在春季供肥之后，应该继续重视并大力进行夏季供肥工作。各地合作社对经济作物的春季供肥工作，确已取得很大成绩。但检查起来，还有因为供应不及时或其他原因，致农民施用底肥太少的。根据平原省新乡、聊城两专区检查，新植棉区有不少棉田就没有施用底肥。武陟县下渠村植棉四百二十亩，上底肥的仅二十亩。
    根据这些情况，在进行夏季供肥工作时，不仅需要做一般需肥量的计算，还需要把春季施肥情况澈底检查一下，弄明白那里施肥太少，那里没有施肥，以便在夏季供肥中进行必要的补救。有些地区准备的夏肥超过所需，应该调剂一部分给不足的地区。有些地区（如河南烟区）夏肥准备尚不充足，应即组织力量，尽快采购，以免耽误农时，造成减产。
