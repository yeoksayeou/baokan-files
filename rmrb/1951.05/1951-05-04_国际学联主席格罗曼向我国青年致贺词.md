International Student Union President Groman issued the following congratulatory message to Chinese youth and students on the eve of China's Youth Day:

	On the occasion of the "May Fourth" Youth Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt respect to the youth and students of the People's Republic of China. The youth and students of the world, along with their international leading organizations, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Student Union, have watched with concern and deep sympathy and support the heroic struggles of their Chinese comrades against domestic reactionary forces and American interference under the rule of the Kuomintang. The joy of the youth and students of the world upon hearing of the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the establishment of a profound friendship between Chinese youth and students and the great friends and models of all peace-loving and loyal warriors, the Soviet youth and students, is difficult to express. I would like to take this opportunity to respectfully wish the heroic people and youth and students of People's China great achievements in the work of peaceful construction under the inspiring leadership of the great Mao Zedong.

    【新华社三日讯】国际学联主席格罗曼于我国青年节前夕发表致中国青年与学生的贺词如下：
    际此“五四”青年节，我谨向中华人民共和国的青年与学生致衷心的敬意。全世界的青年与学生以及他们的国际领导组织世界民主青联与国际学联，曾关心地注视着他们的中国同志在国民党统治下对国内反动势力与美国的干涉所进行的英雄的斗争，并寄予深切的同情和声援。全世界的青年与学生听到中国人民解放斗争的胜利，听到中华人民共和国的成立，以及中国青年与学生和一切争取和平的忠实战士的伟大友人与模范的苏联青年与学生建立了深切的友谊以后，那种狂欢的心情是难以表达的。我愿意借此机会敬祝人民中国的英勇人民和青年与学生，在伟大的毛泽东的鼓舞领导下，在和平建设的工作中，得到巨大的成就。
