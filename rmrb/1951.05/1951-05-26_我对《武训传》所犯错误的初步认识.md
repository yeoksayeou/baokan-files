　　My Preliminary Understanding of the Mistakes Made by "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Sun Yu
    First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt support and respect for the People's Daily editorial of May 20th: "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'."
    "The Life of Wu Xun" committed extremely serious ideological and artistic errors. Regardless of the subjective wishes of the screenwriter and director, objective practice has proven that "The Life of Wu Xun" has had a counter-effect of obscuring revolutionary thought on the audience and is a film that is harmful to the people. In addition to deeply regretting and examining myself, I am willing to sincerely accept and participate in all correct and more severe criticisms in the future to clarify my thinking.
    One of the reasons for my mistakes is that my study was insufficient. Only today do I realize that my understanding of Wu Xun was completely wrong, but I failed to see the problem during the early stages of screenwriting and the year-long production process. I was misled by some of his superficially touching behaviors and therefore overlooked his non-revolutionary essence. I depicted Wu Xun's failure in begging and learning and his pain after discovering his own failure, thinking that that was a criticism of him; but basically, I was sympathizing with him and praising him. This mistake is extremely serious.
    The above is only a preliminary understanding of the mistakes I made and a desire to learn from failure. I will make a thorough review of writing and directing "The Life of Wu Xun" with ample time; while intensifying my studies at work, with the aim of being able to work correctly in the future.

　　我对《武训传》所犯错误的初步认识
    孙瑜
    首先，我谨向五月二十日人民日报社论：“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”表示衷心的拥护和尊重。
    《武训传》犯了绝大的思想上和艺术上的错误。无论编导者的主观愿望如何，客观的实践却证明了《武训传》对观众起了模糊革命思想的反作用，是一部于人民有害的电影。除开深自痛心检讨外，我愿真诚地接受和参加今后一切正确和更严厉一些的批评，澄清自己的思想。
    我犯错误的原因之一就是我的学习不够。我对武训这人的认识在今天才发现是完全错误了，可是在编剧的初期和一年多的摄制过程中都不能看出问题。我被他表面的局部的一些感动人的行为所迷惑，因而忽略了他的非革命的本质。我描写武训行乞与学的失败和他发现了他自己失败后的痛苦，以为那就算是批评了他；可是基本上我是在同情他和歌颂他。这一个错误是极严重的。
    以上仅是我犯错误的一个初步认识和我从失败中获取教训的一个渴望。我将在比较充分的时间里，深刻地作编导《武训传》的总检讨；一面在工作中加紧学习，以期达到以后能够正确地工作的目的。
