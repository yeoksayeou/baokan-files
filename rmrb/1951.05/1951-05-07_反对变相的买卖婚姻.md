　　Oppose Disguised Marriage for Sale
   (I) Unable to Pay the Wedding Gifts, Unable to Marry
　　Editor:
　　In the Nanshibeikou Village area of the Sixth District of Yongnian County, Hebei Province, the phenomenon of marriage for sale still exists seriously. At the time of engagement, the man has to produce hundreds of catties of cotton or a corresponding amount of money as betrothal gifts. If the man does not pay enough, the woman's parents will not allow the marriage. As far as I know, there are seven cases of marriage for sale in just one small street in Nanshibeikou Village. Shen Liren spent 300 catties of cotton, four silk robes, and two sets of fine cloth clothes as betrothal gifts when he got engaged, plus 190,000 yuan for the matchmaker, totaling 3,000,000 yuan for the wedding, equivalent to more than 1,000 catties of cotton. He incurred a lot of debt to get married, and his family's life was severely affected.
　　Due to the existence of marriage for sale, many young men in the area cannot marry because they do not have the money for wedding gifts. Under the arrangement of their parents, young women's marriage problems cannot be satisfactorily resolved freely and voluntarily. I believe that the Yongnian County People's Government should strengthen the publicity of the Marriage Law and earnestly implement the Marriage Law to gradually eliminate the phenomenon of marriage for sale.

　　(II) Marrying a Wife, the Whole Family Starves
　　Editor:
　　Ma Yu, the village chief of the Fourth Village, Fourth Township, First District of Pingluo County, Ningxia Province, allowed his son Ma Zhanshan to get engaged to Zhang Zizi's daughter from Zhonggang Fort in April of the year before last. Zhang Zizi asked the man for forty silver dollars, thirty-nine feet of cloth, and eight shih of wheat as betrothal gifts. Ma Yu didn't have that much money, so he sold seventeen mu of land he had cultivated and sold part of his family property to pay enough betrothal gifts. In February of this year, he let his son get married. After the marriage, the whole family had nothing to eat; the children cried from hunger, and the adults worried; production could not be carried out. These are the harms of marriage for sale. I suggest that local governments earnestly publicize the Marriage Law to the masses, explain the harms of marriage for sale, and make the villagers act in accordance with the Marriage Law.

### 反对变相的买卖婚姻

　　反对变相的买卖婚姻 
   （一）交不齐婚礼娶不成亲编辑同志：
    河北省永年县六区南石北口村一带仍旧存在着严重的买卖婚姻现象。订婚时，男方得拿出数百斤棉花或相当数量的钱作聘礼。如男方交不齐东西，女方家长就不让结婚。据我所知，仅南石北口村一条小街，买卖婚姻就有七起。申立仁在订婚时出了聘礼棉花三百斤、绸缎大袍四件、细布衣裳两身，谢媒款十九万元，连结婚费用共花三百万元，折棉花一千多斤。他为结婚欠下了许多债，家中生活受到严重影响。
    由于买卖婚姻的存在，当地青年男子因无钱出婚礼而不能结婚者很多。青年妇女在父母包办下，婚姻问题也不能自主自愿地得到满意的解决。我认为：永年县人民政府应加强宣传婚姻法，并认真执行婚姻法。逐步消除买卖婚姻的现象。

　　（二）娶个媳妇全家挨饿编辑同志：
    宁夏省平罗县一区四乡四村村长马玉，在前年四月让他儿子马占山和仲岗堡张子的女儿订婚。张?子向男方要白洋四十块、布三丈九尺、麦子八石的采礼。马玉没有这许多钱，就把自己种的地卖了十七亩，又将家中财产变卖了一部分，才给够了采礼。今年二月，他让儿子完了婚。婚后全家就没有吃的；饿的娃娃哭，大人愁；生产也无法进行。这都是买卖婚姻的害处。我建议各地政府应认真向群众宣传婚姻法，讲清买卖婚姻的害处，使老乡们按照婚姻法办事。
