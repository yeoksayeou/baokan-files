　　Beware of Retaliatory Sabotage Activities by Counter-Revolutionaries

　　Since the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionary activities in various regions, counter-revolutionary elements have suffered heavy blows. The phenomena of internal wavering and disintegration have grown daily. Many counter-revolutionary elements, fearing the power of the people, have wavered and bowed their heads to the people, registering and surrendering organizations and weapons. Counter-revolutionary bandit armed forces throughout the country have now largely disappeared. This wise measure by the People's Government has greatly consolidated the people's democratic government, encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people for production and construction, and strongly supported the development of the national people's movement to resist America and aid Korea and land reform, giving a new look to the vast rural and urban areas. However, we must not forget that even at such a time, there are still a few counter-revolutionary elements who are stubbornly hostile to the people, and are carrying out retaliatory sabotage activities against the people by even more vicious means.
　　At present, the means by which the remaining counter-revolutionary forces are carrying out retaliatory sabotage activities are extremely sinister and poisonous. This is being carried out in a planned way under the instructions of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan instructed the counter-revolutionary elements lurking on the mainland to use "terrorist" means to deal with the nationwide vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, plotting "planned assassinations, planned sabotage," and saying that "the situation requires us to strengthen our actions." According to these, the hidden counter-revolutionary elements are adopting the most barbaric and shameless means of retaliation such as murder, arson, and riots. In Northwest, Central South, Southwest, Northeast and other regions, there have recently been incidents of counter-revolutionary elements poisoning, attempting to carry out collective poisoning of the people. In the Southwest Administrative Region, "assassination organizations" and "poisoning squads" organized by counter-revolutionary elements were discovered, and in Yilong County, northern Sichuan, as many as 3,000 people were poisoned throughout the county. Incidents of counter-revolutionary elements organizing riots and arson sabotage have also been discovered in East China, Central South, Southwest and other places. Recently, about ten riot incidents have been discovered in northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan and other regions. Counter-revolutionary elements in Linxia area, Gansu Province, Northwest, plotted to launch an armed riot on March 7, attacking the county seat. Counter-revolutionary elements in Baocheng, Shaanxi, set fire to more than 200 houses in the city on March 16. A workshop in a factory in Qiqihar, Northeast China, was burned down by counter-revolutionary elements. They attempted to use this to sabotage the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea, to sabotage the country's production and construction, and to strike at the people's production enthusiasm, in order to save their dying fate.
　　It is easy to understand why counter-revolutionary elements, under the heavy blows of the Chinese people, still dare to carry out such crazy retaliatory sabotage activities. Any dying class in history will never willingly wait for death. The reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek has cruelly ruled the people for more than 20 years. They never thought that they would be overthrown by the people, and when they were overthrown by the people and were about to be destroyed, they would carry out crazy sabotage as the only means of last struggle. Secondly, the reason why counter-revolutionary elements are carrying out such crazy retaliatory sabotage activities is inseparable from the fact that American imperialism is continuing to wage a war of aggression against Korea, plotting to extend the flames of war to our country's borders, and attempting to use agents lurking on the Chinese mainland to sabotage the Chinese people's great cause of resisting America and aiding Korea in order to benefit its war of aggression. Therefore, American imperialism, through various relationships, instructed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit agents and the agents and spies directly and indirectly controlled by them to use poisonous explosions, arson, assassinations, poisoning and other means to sabotage our various work and constructions. Therefore, as long as American imperialism and the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang exist for one day, the hidden counter-revolutionary elements will not stop their anti-people criminal activities for one day.
　　The fact that counter-revolutionary elements are carrying out such sinister and vicious retaliatory activities against the people naturally does not mean that their power is strong, but rather that their death is approaching. People from all walks of life and public security organs of the people are fully determined and capable of eliminating them, and thereby preventing the occurrence of sabotage incidents. For example, the "Arson Brigade" belonging to the "Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army of China" lurking in the Qiyang area of Hunan Province, plotted to set fire to destroy Qiyang City on March 20, but the entire case was solved by our People's Public Security Organs on March 16. The special agent who committed arson in Lingling County was arrested and executed by the People's Government only ten days after the incident occurred. This is enough to show that no matter how sinister and cruel the counter-revolutionary elements are, the people have the power and means to deal with them. The restlessness of the counter-revolutionary elements not only fails to scare the people, but also deepens the people's hatred for them and strengthens their determination to completely eliminate them. However, it cannot be denied that during this period, the retaliatory activities of the counter-revolutionary elements still brought some losses to the country and the people that could have been avoided. What is the reason for this?
　　This is because, at present, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the thinking of some of our cadres, which gives counter-revolutionary elements an opportunity to take advantage of. Judging from the cases that have occurred in various places, the occurrence of these cases is mainly because some places have not fully mobilized the masses in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Some places still appear timid and hesitant, expressing hesitation in implementing the policy of vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and daring not boldly carry out propaganda work on the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities to the broad masses of the people, in order to fully mobilize the masses, so that the broad masses of the people can pay close attention to the activities of counter-revolutionary elements anytime and anywhere, thus affecting the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people for anti-traitor and eliminating-spy work. Some cadres, seeing that some work has already been done in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, also develop complacency, thinking that "it's almost done," losing their high vigilance against counter-revolutionary elements, leaving gaps for the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. The existence of these gaps is very dangerous, and must be eliminated in time in order to avoid or reduce the losses caused to the country and the people by counter-revolutionary elements.
　　In the vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people of the whole country and all the personnel of the organs must first learn one thing, that is, to develop vigilance against counter-revolutionary elements, and always be on guard against and pay attention to the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. We must clearly recognize that we are still far from meeting the requirements of thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionary elements, and counter-revolutionary elements will never stop their activities after being dealt a heavy blow once or twice. Eliminating the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements is a long-term and arduous task. We demand that the people's governments at all levels strengthen investigation and research work, vigorously carry out propaganda and education work among the masses, raise the consciousness of the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses in preventing traitors and eliminating spies, so that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries can truly become the regular work of the broad masses of the people. With the close cooperation of the masses and the government, we will be able to quickly solve cases when the enemy is still planning sabotage activities, and thus thwart all their conspiracies.

### 警惕反革命分子的报复破坏活动

　　警惕反革命分子的报复破坏活动
    自各地严厉镇压反革命活动以来，反革命分子已遭受沉重打击，其内部的动摇、分化现象日益滋长，不少的反革命分子，害怕人民的威力，因而发生了动摇，纷纷向人民低头，进行登记，交出组织及武器。全国各地反革命的土匪武装现已大部绝迹。人民政府这一英明的措施，大大巩固了人民民主政权，鼓舞了广大人民生产建设的热情，有力地支援了全国人民抗美援朝、土地改革等运动的开展，使广大农村和城市的气象为之一新。但是，我们必须不要忘记，就在这样的时候，仍然有少数死心与人民为敌的反革命分子，正在以更恶毒的手段向人民进行报复破坏活动。
    目前，反革命残余进行报复破坏活动的手段是非常阴险、毒辣的。这是在美蒋匪帮的指使下，有计划地进行的。台湾的蒋匪帮最近曾指使潜伏大陆的反革命分子要以“恐怖”手段对付全国人民热火朝天的镇压反革命运动，阴谋“有计划地暗杀，有计划地破坏”，并且说“时局要吾人加强行动”。暗藏的反革命分子，根据这些正在采取最野蛮、最无耻的谋杀、放火、暴乱等报复手段。在西北、中南、西南、东北等地区，最近都发生反革命分子放毒，企图对人民实行集体毒杀的事件。西南行政区发现反革命分子组织的“暗杀组织”和“放毒小组”，川北仪陇县全县中毒者达三千人之多。反革命分子组织暴乱和纵火破坏等事件，在华东、中南、西南等地也发现了。最近川北、川东等地区曾发现暴乱事件达十起。西北甘肃临夏地区的反革命分子，曾阴谋于三月七日发动武装暴乱，进攻县城。陕西褒城的反革命分子在三月十六日纵火烧毁了城内民房二百多间。东北齐齐哈尔某厂的一个车间被反革命分子放火烧毁。他们图谋以此破坏中国人民的抗美援朝运动，破坏国家的生产建设，打击人民的生产情绪，借以挽救其垂死命运。
    反革命分子在中国人民沉重打击之下，还胆敢如此疯狂地进行报复破坏活动，是容易理解的。历史上任何一个垂死的阶级，决不肯甘心等待死亡。以蒋介石为首的反动集团，二十多年来，一直惨酷地统治着人民，他们从没有想到自己会被人民推翻，而当他们一旦被人民推翻，即将毁灭的时候，他们就将进行疯狂破坏，作为最后挣扎的唯一手段。其次，反革命分子如此疯狂地进行报复破坏活动，是和美帝国主义正继续进行侵略朝鲜的战争，阴谋将战火延向我国边境，并图借潜伏中国大陆的特务分子，来破坏中国人民抗美援朝的伟大事业，以利其侵略战争这一点是分不开的。因此，美帝国主义就经过了各种各样的关系，指使蒋匪帮特务及其直接间接掌握的特务间谍分子，以毒辣的爆破、纵火、暗杀、放毒等手段来破坏我们的各种工作和各项建设。因此只要美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮残余存在一天，潜藏的反革命分子就一天也不会停止他们的反人民的罪恶活动。
    反革命分子如此阴险、恶毒地向人民进行报复活动，这自然并不表示他们的力量强大，而恰恰表示他们死亡的迫近。各界人民以及人民公安机关完全有决心有力量来肃清他们，并从而杜绝破坏事件的发生。例如，潜伏在湖南祁阳一带的“中华反共游击自卫军”所属“放火大队”，曾阴谋在三月二十日放火破坏祁阳城，但在三月十六日就被我人民公安机关全案破获。零陵县纵火的特务，仅在事件发生后的十余天内即被人民政府逮捕处决。这就足以说明，不管反革命分子如何阴险凶残，人民是有力量有办法来对付他们的。反革命分子的蠢动不仅吓不倒人民，而且使人民更加深了对他们的仇恨，更加坚定了彻底消灭他们的决心。但是，不能否认，这一期间反革命分子的报复活动仍然给国家和人民带来了一些本来可以避免的损失。这是什么缘故呢？
    这是因为，目前在我们一部分干部的思想上，还有不少的缺点和问题，使得反革命分子还有可乘之机。从各地发生的案件来看，这些案件的发生，主要是因为某些地方在镇压反革命工作中没有充分发动群众。有些地方至今还显得缩手缩脚，对于执行大张旗鼓镇压反革命的方针，表示犹疑，不敢大胆地向广大的人民进行镇压反革命活动的宣传工作，以充分发动群众，使广大群众随时随地严密注意反革命分子的活动，因而影响了广大人民群众反奸除奸工作的积极性。有一部分干部看到在镇压反革命方面已经作了一些工作，就也滋长着麻痹思想，认为“差不多了”，丧失了对反革命分子的高度警惕，为反革命残余留下空隙。这些空隙的存在，是非常危险的，必须及时予以消灭，才能避免或减少反革命分子所给予国家和人民的损失。
    全国人民和所有机关人员，在镇压反革命的轰轰烈烈的运动中首先必须学会一件事，这就是养成对于反革命分子的警惕性，经常提防与注意反革命分子的活动。我们必须清楚地认识，目前距离彻底肃清反革命分子的要求尚远，反革命分子决不会在受到一两次沉重打击之后，就停止活动的。消灭反革命分子的破坏活动，这是一个长期的艰巨的任务。我们要求各地人民政府加强调查研究工作，大力开展对群众的宣传教育工作，提高群众的觉悟，充分发挥群众的防奸除奸积极性，使镇压反革命的工作真正成为广大群众的经常工作。在群众和政府的密切合作之下，我们就能够乘敌人还在策划破坏行动的时候，迅速破案，因而粉碎他们的一切阴谋活动。
