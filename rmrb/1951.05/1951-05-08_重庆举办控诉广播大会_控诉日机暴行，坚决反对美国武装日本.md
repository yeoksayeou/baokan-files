Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th—The Chongqing People's Broadcasting Station held an accusation broadcast rally on the 3rd to accuse Japanese aircraft of bombing atrocities and oppose the United States' rearmament of Japan. Chongqing was the city that suffered the most from Japanese aircraft bombings during the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to incomplete statistics, from 1938 to 1943, a total of 5,028 Japanese aircraft flew into Chongqing to wreak havoc, dropping a total of more than 11,500 explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The city's downtown areas, such as Douyu Street, Xiaoliangzi, and Shaanxi Street, were almost completely destroyed, and the loss of people's lives and property was incalculable.

This broadcast rally adopted a dramatic effect method. At the beginning, it broadcast majestic songs such as "Sacrifice Has Reached the Final Moment" from the early days of the War of Resistance. Soon, the rumbling sound of airplanes sounded, and the citizens at the radio listening stations quickly heard a series of bomb sounds, house collapses, people's screams, and babies' cries. All kinds of thrilling sounds intertwined, and the tragic situation of twelve years ago was as if it were heard and seen again. Then fourteen citizens who had personally suffered during the Japanese aircraft bombings took the stage to accuse. Yang, an old lady in her fifties, tearfully accused: During the Japanese aircraft bombing on May 4, 1939, her only son was killed by shrapnel that cut off half of his head, and her husband died of illness not long after due to excessive grief. She lived alone in her relatives' house. Later, her relatives' house was also bombed by Japanese aircraft, and she had nowhere to live, wandering around and living a hard life for ten years. Finally, she shouted: The United States is arming Japan, I will never agree to it, let us all rise up and oppose it! Porter Chen Qingyuan took the stage to accuse: My mother, younger brother, and son were all bombed to death by Japanese planes in 1941. Every time after a Japanese aircraft bombing in those years, I went to carry corpses, so I am a witness to the tens of thousands of Chongqing people killed by Japanese aircraft. He described in detail the tragic scene after the bombing of Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th, 1939, saying: At that time, the streets were full of corpses, human flesh hung on the power lines and branches, and the walls were covered with blood and flesh. The houses were either burned or collapsed, and some streets were covered with rubble. Li Zhiqin, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Tong Shaosheng, manager of Minsheng Shipping Company, and Xiao Songli, manager of the private Shashi Yarn Factory, also took the stage to accuse. They pointed out that Chongqing's industry and commerce suffered heavy losses in the Japanese aircraft bombings. Twenty-four of the thirty-four banks were destroyed. The silk and cloth industry alone lost more than 167,000 bolts of cloth, which could provide each of Chongqing's 1.2 million people with a set of clothing. Other losses were incalculable. They firmly stated: We oppose the United States rearming Japan!

All the accusers indignantly accused the "Great Tunnel Massacre" of June 5, 1941, which was caused by the Japanese invaders' bombing and the Kuomintang reactionary government's disregard for human life. Because the Japanese invaders adopted round-robin bombing at that time, more than 10,000 citizens entered the largest tunnel in the city center that day—the tunnel between Shihui City and Ciqi Street on the 18th Step. The tunnel lacked ventilation equipment, and after a long time, the citizens asked to go out of the cave to breathe air, but they were driven back by the Kuomintang military police, and the cave door was locked. As a result, almost all of the more than 10,000 citizens suffocated to death in the tunnel. Many of them died as entire families. And the valuables and jewelry of the victims were all stolen by the Kuomintang military police.

Hu Zi'ang, Deputy Mayor of Chongqing Municipality, finally spoke, calling on the people of the city to unite and further deepen the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, and to oppose the United States arming Japan with practical actions.

The broadcast accusation meeting organized a large number of citizens to listen. Next to many listening stations, a wave of blood and tears of accusation was also set off. Citizens have expressed their determination to oppose the United States arming Japan.

　　重庆举办控诉广播大会
    控诉日机暴行，坚决反对美国武装日本
    【新华社重庆六日电】重庆人民广播电台于三日举办控诉日寇飞机轰炸暴行和反对美国重新武装日本的广播大会。重庆是在抗日战争中遭受日机轰炸最惨重的城市，据不完全统计，自一九三八年至一九四三年，先后飞入重庆市空肆虐之日机达五千零二十八架，投爆炸弹、燃烧弹共一万一千五百余枚。该市闹区都邮街、小梁子、陕西街等街道被炸毁殆尽，人民生命、财产的损失无法算计。
    这一广播大会采用了戏剧效果方法，一开始播出了抗战初期的“牺牲已到最后关头”等雄壮歌曲。不久，隆隆的飞机声响起来，广播收听站上的市民们很快地听到了一片炸弹声、房屋倒塌声、人们的惨叫声、婴儿的啼哭声，各种令人惊心动魄的声音交错着，十二年前的惨状又如闻如见。紧接着十四个在日机轰炸时曾亲身受难的市民上台控诉。五十多岁的杨老太太悲痛地控诉着：一九三九年五月四日日机大轰炸时，她唯一的儿子被弹片砍去了半边脑袋而丧命，丈夫因悲伤过度，不久也病死了。她自己孤苦伶仃寄居在亲戚家里。后来，亲戚家的房屋也被日机炸毁了，她无处安身，到处流浪，过了十年的苦日子。最后，她高呼着：美国武装日本，我坚决不答应，我们大家起来反对啊！搬运工人陈清源上台控诉说：我的母亲、弟弟和儿子都是一九四一年先后被鬼子飞机炸死的，我在几年之间每一次日机轰炸后都去搬运尸体，所以我是日机炸死几万重庆人民的见证人。他详尽地诉述着一九三九年五月三日、四日重庆被炸后的惨象说：那时候，满街是死尸，电线上和树枝上挂着人肉，墙上也涂着血和肉浆。房屋烧的烧了，塌的塌了，有些街道遍地一片瓦砾。工商联合会筹备委员会副主任李志亲、民生轮船公司经理童少生及私营沙市纱厂经理萧松立等亦上台控诉，他们指出重庆工商业在日机轰炸中损失惨重，三十四家银行炸毁二十四家。仅绸布业即损失布匹十六万七千多匹，可供重庆一百二十万人民每人缝制服装一套。其他损失无算。他们坚决表示：反对美国重新武装日本！
    所有的控诉者，都激愤地控诉了一九四一年六月五日的“大隧道惨案”，那是日寇轰炸和国民党反动政府草菅人命所造成的。由于那时日寇采取轮番轰炸，那天有一万多市民进入市中心的最大隧道——石灰市磁器街十八梯间的隧道。隧道内缺乏通风设备，时间一久，市民们便要求出洞呼吸空气，但竟被国民党宪警逐回，并且在洞门上了锁，结果闷在隧道中的一万多市民差不多全部被窒死。其中有很多全家死绝。而被害者的贵重财物、手饰等都被国民党宪警全部偷窃了。
    重庆市人民政府副市长胡子昂最后发言，他号召全市人民团结起来，进一步深入开展抗美援朝运动，用实际行动反对美国武装日本。
    广播控诉会曾组织了广大市民收听，在许多收听站旁边，也掀起了血泪的控诉。市民们纷纷表示了反对美国武装日本的决心。
