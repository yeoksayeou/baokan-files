Tanghe Salt Store Manager Illegally Dismisses Worker
County Party Secretary Handles It Inappropriately

To the Editor:

The manager of the Tanghe County State-Operated Salt Store in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, Yin Bingxin, disregards the work of the trade union and fails to implement the Trade Union Law. The County Party Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) even wrongly supports this behavior, causing the trade union work in the store to be unable to carry out effectively.

On December 16, 1950, the Tanghe County State-Operated Salt Store dismissed worker Mi Wenxi without going through the trade union and without any justification (this violates Article 22 of the Trade Union Law - Editor's Note), and without paying dismissal compensation. The County Federation of Trade Unions raised objections to this. Salt store manager Yin Bingxin refused to accept this, and insisted on dismissing the worker, using the reason that "Mi Wenxi's skills were not high, and he took salt home and sold it again." The County Industry and Commerce Section intervened to mediate, but to no avail. The County Federation of Trade Unions then reported this to the Provincial Labor Bureau, and the Labor Bureau instructed that dismissal compensation should be paid according to regulations. However, the salt store manager still refused to implement this, using the reason that "the higher-ups won't reimburse it, so I can't pay it out of my own pocket." Worker Mi Wenxi had no choice but to appeal to the County Judicial Section, but still did not get a resolution. The County Party Secretary of the CCP, Liu Guopu, expressed dissatisfaction with the County Federation of Trade Union's correct attitude of upholding the Trade Union Law and reasonably supporting worker Mi Wenxi, believing that the salt store was a state-owned enterprise, and the trade union should not act this way. He criticized the Chairman of the County Federation of Trade Unions, Yang Tianyu, saying: "It's an internal matter, and you're suing the Judicial Section? You should educate the workers." This fueled the mistakes of salt store manager Yin Bingxin and also made the Judicial Section dare not make a judgment. As of now, this matter has been dragging on for more than three months and has not yet been resolved.

From what I understand, the phenomenon of not valuing trade union work and not implementing the Trade Union Law is still a common and quite serious phenomenon in Nanyang Prefecture. I hope that the relevant leaders will conduct an inspection.

Editor's Note: Judging from the situation reflected by reader Zhou Bingkun, the actions of the Tanghe County Federation of Trade Unions are correct, Yin Bingxin's attitude is wrong, and County Party Secretary Liu Guopu's actions are even more wrong, not only failing to correctly resolve this issue according to the Trade Union Law, but also supporting Yin Bingxin's wrong behavior. Comrades Yin and Liu should examine their own erroneous thinking and reasonably resolve the dismissal issue of worker Mi Wenxi.

### 唐河盐店经理非法解雇工人  县委书记对此处理不当

　　唐河盐店经理非法解雇工人
    县委书记对此处理不当编辑同志：
    河南省南阳专区唐河县公营盐店经理尹炳鑫，轻视工会工作，不执行工会法，中共县委书记还错误地支持这种行为，致使该店工会工作不能很好开展。
    一九五○年十二月十六日，唐河县公营盐店不通过工会，无理解雇工人米文西（这是违犯工会法第二十二条的——编者）；且未发给解雇费。县总工会曾对此提出反对意见。盐店经理尹炳鑫拒不接受，反以“米文西技术不高，买盐送回家又卖了”为理由，坚持解雇。县工商科曾出面调解，结果无效。县工会又报告了省劳动局，劳动局指示：解雇应按规定发给解雇费。而盐店经理仍以“上级不给报销，不能叫我自己出”为理由，拒不执行。工人米文西无奈，上诉到县司法科，还是没有得到解决。该县中共县委书记刘国璞对工会这种坚持工会法，合理支持工人米文西的正确态度表示不满，他认为盐店是公家的，工会不应该这样作。他批评县工会主席杨天宇说：“内部事情，还向司法科控告，你教育工人算了吧。”这就助长了盐店经理尹炳鑫的错误，也使得司法科不敢判决了。到目前为止，此事已拖了三月有余，还未获得解决。
    据我了解，类此不重视工会工作，不执行工会法的现象，在南阳专区还是一个普遍而相当严重的现象。希望有关领导方面加以检查。
        周炳坤
    编者按：从读者周炳坤所反映的情况来看：唐河县工会的作法是正确的，尹炳鑫的态度是错误的，而县委书记刘国璞不仅不根据工会法来正确地解决这一问题，反而支持尹炳鑫的错误行为更是错误的。尹、刘两同志应检查自己的错误思想，并合理解决工人米文西的解雇问题。
