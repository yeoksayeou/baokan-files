Beijing Baiman Girls' Middle School was originally founded by American imperialists to commemorate the American missionary Mrs. Baiman. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the patriotic ideology of the school's teachers, students, and staff has been unprecedentedly enhanced. They deeply abhorred the school name "Baiman," which humiliated the Chinese people and infringed upon China's educational sovereignty. In order to thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression and make the school a cause of the people, the school's board of directors, with the approval of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, decided to rename it "Beijing Private May First Girls' Middle School." The school held a grand renaming ceremony on the afternoon of April 30th. Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union, and various schools attended.

　　北京贝满女子中学改名为五一女子中学
    北京贝满女中原是美帝国主义为纪念美籍传教士贝满夫人而创办的。抗美援朝运动展开以来，该校师生员工爱国主义思想空前提高。对于污辱中国人民、侵害中国教育主权的“贝满”校名，一致深恶痛绝。为彻底扫清美帝国主义文化侵略影响，使学校成为人民的事业，经该校董事会讨论，北京市文教局批准，决定改名为“北京市私立五一女子中学”。该校在四月三十日下午举行隆重更名典礼，北京市文教局、中国教育工会北京市委员会和各校均派代表参加。
