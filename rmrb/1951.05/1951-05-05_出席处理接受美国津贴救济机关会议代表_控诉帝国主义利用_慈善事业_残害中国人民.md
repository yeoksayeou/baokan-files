Representatives attending the meeting on handling US-funded relief agencies on the 28th of last month denounced the crimes of imperialist elements who, under the guise of "charity," harmed the Chinese people.

Representative Liu Cuiying first condemned the crime of the Joseph Benevolent Society Convent orphanage of the Catholic Church on Garden Mountain in Wuchang for abusing and murdering infants. The funds for this orphanage were provided by the American vice-bishop Xu Laide. Liu Cuiying was forced to work as a "nun" in the orphanage after liberation due to temporary financial difficulties. According to her knowledge, two or three, or three to five infants were sent to the orphanage every day. But after ten days, these infants were tortured beyond recognition. The infants' buttocks and armpits were festering because they were not washed regularly. Some infants rubbed their feet on the bed boards, wearing holes in them. When infants fell ill, they were left to be treated haphazardly by a Chinese nun who had only three months of nursing training, and infectious diseases were not isolated. As a result, eight or nine out of ten infants who were brought in died within a month. Many infants died without anyone caring for them, and some had large pieces of flesh bitten off by rats. These dead infants were buried on a desolate hill of about one mu in size, rarely visited by people. On this desolate hill, small human skulls could be seen everywhere. Liu Cuiying said: "According to my estimation over the past two years, about two thousand infants have died. This orphanage has been operating for twenty-three years, how many infants must have been strangled?" She angrily shouted: "I accuse the American imperialist elements and their running dogs, this is their bloody crime of harming the next generation of China under the guise of 'charity'!"

Representative Chang Zheng condemned the principal of the Dachang Nursery, American clergyman Stephen. This nursery was originally located in Dachang Town, Shanxi. In 1948, when Shanxi was about to be liberated, it was moved to Beijing by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and was taken over by the Beijing Relief Branch this March. Stephen changed all the adopted children's last names to Si, and kept them locked in the nursery all day to read the Bible, sing hymns, and pray, preventing them from contacting the children in the neighborhood. She said, "Those outside are wild children, they are Gentiles." As a result, the children knew nothing except a few scriptures. Stephen treated the children very cruelly. An eleven-year-old child named Shou Yu suffered from dysentery, but the nursery refused to buy him medicine, saying that God would heal all diseases and there was no need to take medicine. Shou Yu died of dysentery. A child named Timothy was beaten until his nose and mouth bled for not going to church. Such beatings and abuse were common. When Stephen returned to the United States in 1941, she handed over the position to Chinese pastor Wang Zhen. Wang was a complete running dog of American imperialism. In addition to forcing children to do hard labor, he also instilled reactionary ideas in them. After liberation, he tried his best to prevent progressive young people in the nursery from joining the Youth League. He rebuked the children and said: "You eat American food and still oppose America?" Chang Zheng then talked about how she was admitted to a military cadre school and found warmth in the revolutionary family. She said: "I have never enjoyed maternal love since I was a child. I grew up in Dachang Nursery in days of beatings and scoldings. Now I have found my dear mother—the Chinese Communist Party." She shed tears of emotion, and many representatives wept with her.

Representative Tao Enguang, who had lived in Canaan Orphanage for ten years, condemned the crimes of the American principal of Canaan Orphanage, Ruilemei. Ruilemei was very brutal to the children, not only beating, scolding, and punishing them with hard labor, but also "punishing them with food." Once, more than a hundred children were punished by not being allowed to eat for three or four meals in a row. Her husband, Nie Shouguang (Chinese), raped two older girls and then married them off. After that, there was no more news. When the condemnation was carried out at the meeting, more than twenty children from the orphanage came to listen. Among them was a twelve-year-old girl named Ma Ciai, who was so stunted from malnutrition and overwork that she was as tall as another four-year-old child.

Catholic representative Cui Tianpei worked as a clerk in Nanjing Ciai Nursery for two years, and he witnessed the imperialist elements' abuse and harm to Chinese children. He said: The children were often not fed enough, not warmly clothed, and often got sick. Sometimes the children cried, and the nuns would lock them in solitary confinement. The children were not treated when they were sick, and they died in large numbers. The bodies of the dead children were simply wrapped in two newspapers and buried by someone. The foreign nuns also said: "The dead children are blessed because they have all gone to heaven!" Cui Tianpei condemned: "I am a Catholic. How can I remain silent when I see the children I take care of dying beside me under the cruel treatment of foreign nuns? But the foreigners forbade me to speak, forbade me to reveal the situation inside the orphanage, and finally fired me."

Sheng Quansen, a student at the Shanghai School for the Blind, condemned the principal of the school, Briton Fu Bu-lan. Fu grew up in the United States from an early age and was educated in the United States. He made a lot of money under the pretext of running relief work. Fu bought seven cars during his thirty-seven years as principal. He lived luxuriously. He built a private garden in the school and often entertained guests in the garden. Fu raised a foreign dog. When a blind child accidentally kicked the dog, Fu asked the student to apologize to the dog in English and bow to the dog. He never cared about the students when they were sick, but he gave his dog injections every day when it was sick. Students who showed slight dissatisfaction with his suppression would be expelled. Sheng Quansen finally said: Although the Shanghai School for the Blind has a history of forty years, it has only admitted more than three hundred students, of whom 20% died halfway, and two-thirds of the dead students suffered from lung disease. Moreover, because the education they received could not be combined with real life, 20% of those who left the school became fortune tellers who cheated people, and only 5% served in the education sector and other fields. This is the achievement of the "good deeds" boasted by imperialism.

Zhu Songshi, a seventy-two-year-old from the Ganyu Hutong Nursing Home in Beijing, also participated in the condemnation. She complained that the American in charge of the nursing home did not install electric lights in the nursing home. Some old people groped in the dark and fell down, breaking their heads. The American in charge of the nursing home invested the funds of the nursing home in an electric light company in Shanghai to make money for himself. The elderly in the nursing home were not given medical treatment when they were sick, and were left to die. The living were given two meals of white rice a day, regardless of whether they were full or not. Zhu Songshi said: "The government took over this nursing home, and now electric lights have been installed, and we eat three meals a day. The old people are happily thanking Chairman Mao."

When the condemnation reached Lin Wucai's speech, the emotions of the entire audience reached a climax of anger. Lin Wucai told her experience word by word with tears in her eyes. She is a twenty-year-old girl this year. When she was twelve years old, she was sent to the Mercy Hall in Beijing because her family could not afford to raise her. There were many girls of her age in the Mercy Hall. They lost their health under the abuse of the "grandmothers" (nuns). There were many tasks assigned every day, including embroidery, and sewing socks. They had to get up early and work late to catch up. Some who were slightly slower at work could not finish their work in one day, and would be severely beaten the next day. Therefore, some children had to rush to work under the lights in the toilet at night. The children had no place to complain, and secretly composed a song, the lyrics of which included "Cruel father, deadly mother, sent me to the Mercy Hall". She spent six years in the Mercy Hall in this way, half-starved and overworked. In the year she turned eighteen, Beijing was liberated. These "grandmothers" deceived them and said: "When the Communist Party comes, the older girls will be taken out and assigned." In this way, 30% of the girls over the age of fifteen in the Mercy Hall were forced to marry. They had no right to intervene in who they married, because once they arrived at the Mercy Hall, their lives, deaths, marriages, and funerals were all decided by the Mercy Hall. Lin Wucai's parents wanted to take her back, but the nuns in the Mercy Hall said that they could take her back, but they had to pay for six or seven years of living expenses. Of course, her parents could not afford it. Later, the orphanage decided to marry her off. On the night of her wedding, she learned that she had been married to an idiot. Neighbors who came to see the bride all said "what a pity". When she returned to the Mercy Hall after her marriage, the nuns said to her: "Because you are guilty, God will not bless you." After she married the idiot, she initially "accepted her fate", but she could not suppress her pain, and she became somewhat mentally disturbed. Later, she was sent back to her hometown—Tongxian—by her husband's family. In Tongxian, she came into contact with some working cadres, and in this way she gradually understood. Last January, she filed for divorce with the court. After the court approved it, she was finally liberated. The Beijing Democratic Women's Federation gave her a lot of encouragement and introduced her to work in a factory, where she felt like she had entered another world. In addition to working, she also went to study every day. She said: "These imperialist elements deceived me, saying that God deliberately wanted me to suffer because I was guilty. Did God also deliberately want me to marry an idiot?"

Zhu Qinghe, a staff member of the China Branch of the Christian World Service Committee, Hu Dayue, a staff member of the Shanghai Bethel Orphanage, Li Tianyu, a professor at Soochow University, Wang Jingfang of the Shanghai Bethel Orphanage, and Chen Jiarui, a student at the Peking University Nursing School, continued to condemn. They all condemned the criminal facts of imperialist elements based on personal experience. Chen Jiarui also pointed out the scars on her body from being beaten by foreign nuns to everyone, explaining the viciousness of imperialist elements towards orphans.

Finally, Chou Zigang, the director of the People's Liberation Army Children's Protection Institute, spoke, using vivid examples to illustrate the happy lives of children in the new society. She called on all relief and welfare workers to take practical actions to rescue those children who are still suffering under the devastation of imperialism.

　　出席处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议代表
    控诉帝国主义利用“慈善事业”残害中国人民
    出席处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议的代表于上月二十八日对帝国主义分子利用“慈善事业”做掩护，残害中国人民的罪行进行了控诉。
    代表刘翠英首先控诉了武昌花园山天主堂若瑟善功会修道院育婴堂虐杀婴儿的罪行。该院经费是由美籍副主教徐赉德负责支给的。刘翠英在解放后因一时生活困难被迫到该院作“修道”。据她所知，每天都有两三个或三五个婴儿送到这个育婴堂来。但是过十几天这些婴儿就被折磨得不成样子了。婴儿的臀部和腋窝因为经常不洗而溃烂。有的两只脚在床板上蹭跶，磨成窟窿。婴儿生了病，只任凭一个学过三个月护士的中国修道胡乱处理，生了传染病也不隔离。就这样，收进来了的婴儿十之八九不出一个月就死了。许多婴孩死了也没有人管，有的被老鼠咬去一大块肉。这些死去的婴孩都埋葬在一座人迹罕到的有一亩见方的荒山上。在这座荒山上，随处可以看到东一块、西一块的小人头骨。刘翠英说：“据我两年来的估计，死去的婴孩大约有二千左右。这个育婴堂开办了已有二十三年，该有多少婴孩被扼杀啊？”她愤怒地高呼：“我控诉美帝国主义分子和他们的走狗，这就是他们披着‘慈善’的外衣，残害中国后一代的血腥罪行！”
    代表常铮控诉大常育幼院院长美国教士司提芬。这个育幼院原设在山西大常镇，一九四八年山西快解放的时候，由善后救济总署给搬到北京，本年三月由北京救济分会接收。司提芬把所有收容的孩子都改姓司，把他们整天关在院里念圣经，唱圣诗作祷告，不让他们和邻居的儿童接触。她说：“外面是野孩子，是外邦人。”弄得孩子们除了几句经文外，什么都不懂。司提芬对待孩子非常残忍。有一个十一岁的小孩叫首玉，害了痢疾，院里不给他买药，说是上帝会治好一切疾病的，用不着吃药。首玉就因拉痢疾死去了。有个孩子叫提摩太，因为不去做礼拜，被她们把鼻子和嘴打得直冒血还不停地打。这种打骂和虐待的情形是经常的。司提芬一九四一年回国时把职务交给中国牧师王镇。王是个十足的美帝国主义走狗，他除了强迫儿童作苦工外还贯输他们反动思想。解放后，他竭力阻挠院里进步的少年加入青年团。他训斥儿童们说：“你们吃美国的饭还要反对美国？”常铮接着讲她考进了军事干部学校，在革命的大家庭中找到了温暖，她说：“我从小就没有享受过母爱，我在大常育幼院是在挨打受骂的日子里长大的，现在我找到了我亲爱的母亲——中国共产党。”她激动得流下了眼泪，很多代表同她一起流泪。
    曾在迦南孤儿院生活十年的陶恩光代表控诉迦南孤儿院院长美国人瑞乐美的罪行。瑞乐美对孩子非常凶暴，打、骂、罚苦工不算，还“罚饭”，有一次一百多个孩子同时被罚不许吃饭。有两个女孩子竟被罚接连三四顿不许吃饭。她的丈夫聂受光（中国人）曾把两个较大的女孩子强奸了，紧接着就把她们嫁给人。以后就再也没有消息了。在大会进行控诉时有该院二十几个孩子来听，其中有一个十二岁的女孩子马慈爱因为营养缺乏和过度劳役的虐待，长得竟和另一个四岁孩子一般高。
    天主教徒代表崔天培曾在南京慈爱育幼院做过两年职员，他亲眼看到帝国主义分子虐待和残害中国儿童的情形。他说：孩子们经常吃不饱，穿不暖，常闹病。孩子们有时哭，修女们便把他们关到禁闭室里。孩子们有病也不给医治，大批地死亡。死了的孩子只用两张报纸把尸体一卷，叫人提出埋掉了事。外国修女还讲：“死了的孩子是有福的。因为他们都升天堂去了！”崔天培控诉说：“我是天主教徒，眼看着自己照顾的孩子在外国修女的残酷作践下，死在自己身边，还能再沉默不言吗？但外国人不准我讲，不准我透露院内的情形，最后把我开除了。”
    上海盲童学校学生盛全森控诉该校校长英国人傅步兰。傅自幼生长美国，在美国受教育。他假借办救济事业的名义，大赚其钱。傅做三十七年校长，先后买了七部小汽车。吃、住都很华贵。在校中筑有私人花园，经常在园中宴客。傅养了一条洋狗。盲童无意地踹了狗一下，傅便要学生用英文向狗道歉说：对不起。并向狗鞠躬。学生们生病，他从不关心，可是他的狗生病，他却每天给它打针。学生们对他的压制稍微表示出不满，便会遭到开除的处分。盛全森最后说：上海盲童学校虽然已有四十年的历史，但前后仅仅收纳了三百多个学生，其中有百分之二十半路死去了，死去的学生中三分之二是患肺病的。又由于所受的教育不能和实际生活结合，离校后有百分之二十作了骗人的算命先生，其他在教育界和别的方面服务的只占百分之五。这就是帝国主义夸耀的“善行”的成绩。
    北京甘雨胡同养老院的七十二岁的朱宋氏也参加了控诉。她诉说管院的美国人不给院里按电灯。有的老人摸着黑下炕，一下子跌下来，头都跌破了。管院的美国人却把院里的经费投到上海一家电灯公司去，自己发财。院里养老的有病，不给看，听凭死去。活着的一天两顿白饭，不管吃饱吃不饱。朱宋氏说：“政府接办了这所养老院，现在电灯也按上了，每天吃三顿饭，老人们都高兴地在感谢毛主席。”
    大会控诉到蔺武才发言时，全场情绪激愤达到顶点。蔺武才一字一泪地诉说她的遭遇。她今年是个二十岁的女孩子，十二岁时因为家里养不起被送进北京的仁慈堂，在仁慈堂里和她年纪相仿的女孩子很多，她们在“姑奶奶”们（修女）的虐待下损失了健康。每天规定的活很多，挑花、刺绣、缝袜口，每天得起早搭黑地赶，有的手头稍慢一点，一天便做不完，第二天便要受毒打。因此，有些孩子不得不在黑夜里到厕所里的灯光下赶活。孩子们有冤无处诉，背地里编成一只歌，歌词中有“狠心的爹，要命的娘，把我送进仁慈堂”。她就这样半饥半饱，劳劳碌碌地在仁慈堂度过了六年。她十八岁那年，北京解放了。这些“姑奶奶”们骗她们说：“共产党来了，大的姑娘都要拉出去分配。”这样，仁慈堂的十五岁以上的女孩子有百分之三十被强迫嫁出去了。嫁给谁，她们自己是没有一点权利过问的，因为到了仁慈堂，生死嫁娶就都由仁慈堂作主。蔺武才的父母要领她回去，但是仁慈堂的修女们说，领回可以，必须偿付六、七年的生活费。她的父母当然是出不起。以后她就由院方作主给嫁出去了。在结婚的那天晚上，她才知道把她嫁给了一个傻子。左邻右舍来看新娘子的都说“怪可惜了的”。等她结婚后回到仁慈堂时，修女们对她说：“因为你有罪，天主才不降福给你。”她和傻子结婚后，最初是“认命”，但是她究竟抑制不了自己的痛苦，她变得精神有些失常了，后来，她被婆家送回老家—通县。在通县她接触一些工作干部，这样她才逐渐明白起来。去年一月她向法院提出离婚，经过法院判准，她才算得到解放。北京市民主妇联曾给她不少的鼓励，并把她介绍到工厂去做工，她像到了另外一个天地。除了做工外，每天还去学习。她说：“这些帝国主义分子骗我，说是天主有意叫我受苦，因为我有罪。难道天主也有意叫我嫁给一个傻子？”
    继续控诉的有基督教世界服务委员会中国分会的工作人员朱清和、上海伯特利孤儿院工作人员胡大越，沪江大学教授励天予、上海伯特利孤儿院王经芳、北京大学护士学校学生陈家瑞。他们都以亲身经历控诉帝国主义分子的罪恶事实。陈家瑞并把自己身上被外国修女毒打的伤痕指给大家看，说明帝国主义分子对孤儿的毒辣。
    最后，解放军儿童保育院院长丑子冈代表讲话，她以生动的实例说明在新社会中儿童幸福生活的情形。她号召一切救济福利工作者，以实际行动来解救那些还在帝国主义摧残下的受难的儿童。
