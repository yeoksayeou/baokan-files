　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 3rd: TASS reports: Japanese military leaders, under orders from the U.S. military headquarters, are drafting detailed plans for the restoration of Japanese armed forces.

　　As is widely known, a group of former Japanese generals—including former Minister of the Army, General Shimomura; Lieutenant General Kawabe; Major General Hattori, Chief of the Operations Bureau of the Imperial General Headquarters; Lieutenant Colonel Hara, an official of the "Mobilization Bureau"; Lieutenant Colonel Hashimoto (transliteration); and others—are drafting plans for the restoration of the army. This plan stipulates a massive increase in the strength of the Police Reserve Force, equipping it with heavy weapons, and establishing a regular "defense" force of twenty divisions, with a quota of 300,000 men, which will be increased later. Furthermore, there are plans to establish a so-called "Volunteer Army," ostensibly under the control of the United Nations, but in reality, it is a weapon of the U.S. imperialists.

　　It is said that some of these individuals—especially Kawabe and Hattori—actively assisted the U.S. military headquarters in drafting plans for the war of aggression against Korea. Hattori also serves as a spy for U.S. intelligence agencies.

　　The plan to restore the Japanese navy is currently being drafted under the command of former Admiral Nomura and former Rear Admiral Tomioka, Chief of the First Bureau of the Naval General Headquarters. They are working under the direction of the U.S. Far East Fleet Command. Plans to restore the Japanese air force are also being drafted.

　　Preparations for implementing these plans have already begun. According to the *Sangyo Keizai Shimbun*, some Japanese textile companies recently received orders for 6.6 million yards of twill, of which 2.3 million yards must be delivered by July this year. This batch of cloth is enough to make 1.8 million sets of U.S. military uniforms. At the same time, some textile companies received orders for 1.8 million sets of military shirts.

    前日军首脑正草拟计划准备大量增加武装部队
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社东京消息：日本军事首脑奉美军总部之命，正在草拟恢复日本武装部队的详细计划。
    如众周知，前日本将领一批——其中有陆相下村，川部中将，大本营作战局局长服部少将，“动员局”官员原中佐，桥本（译音）中佐及其他人物，正在草拟恢复陆军的计划，其中规定要大量增加警察后备队的实力和以重武器装备该队以及设立一支二十个师的正规“防御”军，名额为三十万人，但以后将予增加。不仅如此，还计划成立所谓“志愿军”，表面上，它将在联合国的管制之下，但实际上却是美帝国主义者的武器。
    据称，这一批人中间有若干人——特别是川部和服部——曾积极帮助美军总部拟订侵略朝鲜战争的计划。服部同时充当美国情报机关的间谍。
    恢复日本海军的计划目前正在前海军大将野村和前海军大本营第一局局长富冈少将的指挥下起草中。他们是在美国远东舰队司令部的指挥下工作的。恢复日本空军的计划也在拟订中。
    实行这些计划的准备工作业已开始。据《产业经济新闻》消息，日本的一些纺织公司最近接到六百六十万码斜纹布的订货，其中二百三十万码必须在今年七月间交货。这一批布足够制成美军制服一百八十万套。同时，一些纺织公司接就订做一百八十万套军用衬衣的订货。
