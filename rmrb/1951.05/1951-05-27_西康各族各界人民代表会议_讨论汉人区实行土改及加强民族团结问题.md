Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, 24th—The first Xikang Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups was held from the 11th to the 17th of this month. The conference was attended by 250 representatives from the Han, Yi, Tibetan, Hui, Miao, and Lisu ethnic groups. Now that the suppression of bandits in Xikang Province has been basically completed and the unity of all ethnic groups is increasing day by day, the central topics of this conference were to discuss striving to complete land reform in the Han areas of the province this year and further strengthening ethnic unity. During the discussion of the land reform report, farmer representatives spoke one after another, unanimously demanding the implementation of land reform, and representatives from all walks of life also unanimously supported this reasonable demand of the farmers. In addition to expressing their firm support for the implementation of land reform in the Han areas, minority ethnic representatives also expressed their willingness to unite closely and assist the People's Government in capturing the despotic landlords who had fled to the minority ethnic areas. At the meeting, representatives of all ethnic groups believed that the gradual elimination of estrangement among and within ethnic groups and the increasing stability of social order today are due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, for which they expressed their heartfelt gratitude.

During the conference, representatives of all ethnic groups visited the Ya'an City Exhibition on the Suppression of Special Agents and Maintenance of Public Security. They unanimously supported the correct measures taken by the People's Government to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

At the meeting, representatives of all ethnic groups resolved to combine the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with practical work such as strengthening ethnic unity and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and to popularize the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to the marginal areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups.

After electing the members of the First Consultative Committee of the Xikang Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups, the meeting adopted the Patriotic Covenant of Unity of All Ethnic Groups and a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
