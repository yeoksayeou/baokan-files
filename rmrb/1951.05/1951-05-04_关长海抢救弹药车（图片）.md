    Guan Changhai Rescues Ammunition Car
     Painted by: Ying Tao
    (Seven) They ran to car number six-seven-five. The driver, Qin Deshan, and Liu Fengqi quickly jumped into the locomotive. Guan Changhai said, "You prepare to start the engine; I'll go unhook the cars and try to pull out as many as possible."
    (Eight) The fire on the ammunition car grew fiercer; the ammunition exploded like boiling water in a pot. Guan Changhai crawled from under the car to a place only one car away from the explosions, heroically completing the task of unhooking the cars.
    (Nine) The hook was unfastened, the driver opened the steam valve, and rapidly pulled five ammunition cars out of the danger zone.

    （七）他们跑到六七五号车跟前。司机秦德善和刘凤岐迅速跳上了机车。关长海说：“你们准备发车好了，我去摘钩，尽量多拉出几辆。”
    （八）弹药车上的火越烧越凶；弹药爆炸像开了锅一样。关长海从车底下爬到离爆炸处仅一辆车的地方，英勇地完成了摘钩任务。
    （九）钩摘开了，司机打开汽门，把五辆弹药车急速拉出了危险地带。
