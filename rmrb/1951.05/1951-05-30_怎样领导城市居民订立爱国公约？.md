How to Lead City Residents in Establishing Patriotic Pledges?
    Lin Hong

    The characteristic of urban residents is loose organization and complex occupations. To mobilize such masses to establish patriotic pledges, the best way is to mobilize various activists, under the leadership and control of cadres, to go to the masses they are connected with, to mobilize them to conduct full deliberation and discussion, to raise the political consciousness of the masses, and then to initiate the establishment; only in this way can the patriotic pledges be practical, acceptable to the masses, and truly effective.

    Before mobilizing residents to establish patriotic pledges, cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou mobilized resident group leaders, women group leaders, hygiene group leaders, and winter defense team leaders to conduct door-to-door propaganda and education, or combined the transmission of resolutions from district people's representative conferences by district representatives, and universally held various small-scale forums and accusation meetings among residents, using methods of recalling and comparing to stimulate the masses' enthusiasm for resisting America and loving the country. On the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation, they jointly established patriotic pledges for their streets, neighborhoods, or households. For example, in the early days of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in Zhabei District of Shanghai, the residents quite universally held erroneous ideas of being pro-American, admiring America, and fearing America. Some people felt that American imperialism was not bad because they had eaten the household rice distributed by the United States in the past; others were afraid of the United States, saying that American soldiers were "not easy to mess with." In order to correct these incorrect ideas, the district, through activists among the residents, convened more than 670 small-scale forums, with more than 18,000 people participating. The masses at the meeting accused the American and Japanese imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of oppressing and persecuting the Chinese people, and exposed the mask of American "relief"; at the same time, they recalled and compared their lives before and after liberation, thus raising the consciousness of the masses. As a result, 370 out of 400 lanes in the district established patriotic pledges. Before establishing resident patriotic pledges, Shuiximenwai Avenue in Nanjing organized 50 to 60 district people's representatives, street consultative committee members, resident group leaders, and winter defense service team members to conduct propaganda among the masses, and first studied the methods of establishing patriotic pledges in two resident groups, gained experience, and promoted it. As a result, 126 out of 194 households in the entire street established patriotic pledges.

    When mobilizing urban residents to establish patriotic pledges, pay attention to preventing activists from monopolizing and acting on behalf of the masses, and avoid commandism. This tendency has occurred in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. For example, in Chengqing Lane, Songshan District, Shanghai, the activists prepared a draft of the patriotic pledge in advance, and it was passed by the winter defense team members at a household head meeting without serious discussion by the masses. Song Jinlong, an activist in Yangjing District of the city, even forced the masses to sign the patriotic pledge. Someone on the spot raised to him: "Patriotic pledges should be discussed by everyone, and haste makes waste." This perfunctory approach not only made the patriotic pledges a mere formality, but also aroused resentment among the masses. Therefore, when leading residents to establish patriotic pledges, all cities must pay attention to the leadership and education of activists, first of all, to make them understand the meaning of establishing patriotic pledges, and should supervise and inspect them at any time. The practice of complete laissez-faire is very harmful.

    Because most of the residents are housewives, elderly people, vendors, small shop employees, and rickshaw workers, etc., the content of the patriotic pledges must be concise and specific. It is best that everyone can memorize all the articles; otherwise, if too many are established, they will not be remembered, and they will not be effective.

    According to the experience of various cities, in addition to including some necessary political articles, resident patriotic pledges must also be tailored to the different situations of residents of all classes, and a few practical and feasible articles must be established. For example, Dongdan vendors in Beijing have long had two problems: one is that they have not achieved fair transactions; the other is that the money earned from sales is spent as it is sold, and as a result, taxes cannot be paid on time. When establishing patriotic pledges, they focused on achieving fair transactions and ensuring timely tax payment. In order to ensure timely tax payment, they also stipulated a method of saving part of the money earned from sales. Many large courtyards, lanes, or hutongs do not pay attention to public health and welfare, and improving sanitation can also be included as a part of the patriotic pledge. However, these specific tasks should not be established too much, and the requirements should not be too high, so as to avoid difficulties for the masses in implementing them; at the same time, it is even more necessary to prevent the patriotic pledges from being vulgarized, with only some specific trivial matters and no political content.

    According to materials from various places, general urban resident patriotic pledges roughly include the following contents:

    First, support Chairman Mao, support the Chinese Communist Party, support the People's Government, and ensure the implementation of the policies and decrees of the People's Government.

    Second, according to one's own specific circumstances, support the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and build a prosperous and happy new China with production, work, or material objects. (It should be noted here that uniformity should not be forced, and the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength, and contribute as much as they can" should be strictly adhered to.)

    Third, actively assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and automatically report special agents and saboteurs.

    Fourth, work hard to study current affairs and culture, and improve political understanding. (This is an important method to consolidate and improve patriotic enthusiasm; but do not force uniformity in learning time and methods.)

    Fifth, jointly do a good job in public health and welfare work in the hutong, lane, or courtyard.

    In order to make the residents' patriotic pledges truly effective and gradually improve the masses' patriotic enthusiasm, attention must also be paid to inspection work. Some resident patriotic pledges already include an article on regular inspection and summary, which is very good; but this alone is not enough. Police stations or other grassroots mass organizations should also conduct inspections from top to bottom through the resident organization system. When inspecting the implementation of patriotic pledges, some city police stations publicly commended model units at resident meetings. Facts have proved that this is an effective method to promote the development of the patriotic pledge movement.

　　怎样领导城市居民订立爱国公约？
    林洪
    城市居民的特点是组织松散，职业复杂。要发动这样的群众订立爱国公约，最好的方式，是在干部的领导和掌握下，动员各种积极分子分别到自己所联系的群众中去，发动他们进行充分的酝酿和讨论，提高群众的政治觉悟，然后再来发起订立；只有这样，爱国公约才能订得切合实际，为群众所乐于接受，真正发生效力。
    南京、上海和广州等城市，在发动居民订立爱国公约以前，都动员居民组长、妇女组长、卫生组长和冬防队长等挨门挨户地进行宣传教育，或结合区代表传达区各界人民代表会议的决议，在居民中普遍召开各种小型座谈会和控诉会，用回忆对比的方式激发了群众反美爱国的热情，在群众自觉自愿的基础上共同订立了本街道、里弄或一家一户的爱国公约。如上海市闸北区在抗美援朝初期，居民中相当普遍地存在着亲美、崇美和恐美的错误思想。有的人觉得美帝国主义并不坏，因为他过去吃过美国配售的户口米；有的人怕美国，说美国兵“不好惹”。该区为了纠正这些不正确思想，先后通过居民中的积极分子，召开了六百七十多次小型座谈会，有一万八千多人参加。群众在会上控诉了美、日帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮欺压残害中国人民的罪行，揭穿了美国“救济”的假面具；同时又回忆对比了解放前后的生活，因而提高了群众觉悟。结果，全区四百条里弄中有三百七十条都订立了爱国公约。南京市水西门外大街在订立居民爱国公约前，把五、六十个区人民代表、街道协商委员、居民小组长和冬防服务队员组织起来，分别到群众中去进行宣传，并先在两个居民小组中研究了订立爱国公约的方法，取得经验，加以推广，因而全街一九四户就有一百二十六户订立了爱国公约。
    在发动城市居民订立爱国公约时，要注意防止积极分子的包办代替和强迫命令。北京、上海等地都发生过这种偏向。如上海市嵩山区承庆里，就是积极分子事前拟好爱国公约草案，未经群众认真讨论，即由冬防队员在户长会议上一读通过。该市洋泾区的积极分子宋金龙更强迫群众在爱国公约上签名。当场就有人向他提出：“爱国公约要让大家来讨论，性急要不得。”这种草率从事的方法，不但使爱国公约流于形式，而且引起了群众的反感。因此，各城市在领导居民订立爱国公约时，必须注意对积极分子的领导和教育，首先要使他们懂得订立爱国公约的意义，并应随时进行督促和检查，完全放任自流的作法，是非常有害的。
    因为居民中大部分是家庭妇女、老年人、摊贩、小商店店员和三轮车工人等，因此爱国公约的内容必须简要、具体，最好所有的条文每个人都能背诵下来；否则订得太多，记不住，也就不会发生效力。
    根据各城市的经验，居民爱国公约除应包括一些必要的政治条文外，还必须针对各阶层居民的不同情况，订出切实可行的几条。如北京东单摊贩长期存在着两个问题，一个是没有作到公平交易；一是平时售货所得的款项，随卖随花，结果到期缴不上税。在订立爱国公约时，他们就以作到公平交易和保证按时缴税为主要内容。为了保证按时缴税，他们还规定把平常售货所得提出一部分储蓄起来的办法。许多大杂院、里弄或胡同不注意清洁卫生等福利事业，改进卫生工作等也可以作为爱国公约的一项内容。不过这些具体的工作不应订得太多，也不要要求过高，以免群众执行起来发生困难；同时更应防止把爱国公约庸俗化，只有一些具体琐屑的事情，而没有政治内容的偏向。
    根据各地的材料来看，一般城市居民爱国公约大致包括了这样一些内容：
    第一、拥护毛主席，拥护中国共产党，拥护人民政府，保证贯彻执行人民政府的政策法令。
    第二、根据自己的具体情况，以生产、工作或实物支援抗美援朝，建设富强康乐的新中国。（这里要注意不要强求一致，应严守有钱出钱有力出力，能出多少出多少的原则。）
    第三、积极协助人民政府镇压反革命，自动检举特务和破坏分子。
    第四、努力学习时事和文化，提高政治水平。（这是巩固和提高爱国热情的重要方法；但在学习时间和方法上不要强求一致。）
    第五、共同搞好本胡同、里弄或院落内的公共卫生福利工作。
    为了使居民的爱国公约真正发生作用，并逐步提高群众的爱国热情，还必须注意检查工作。有些居民爱国公约中已经订有定期检查总结一条，是很好的；但仅这一点还不够。派出所或其他基层的群众团体，还应从上到下通过居民组织系统进行检查。有些城市派出所在检查爱国公约的履行情形时，在居民会上公开表扬模范的单位，事实证明这是一种推动爱国公约运动发展的有效方法。
