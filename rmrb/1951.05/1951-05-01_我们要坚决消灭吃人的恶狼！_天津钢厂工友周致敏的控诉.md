　　We Must Resolutely Eliminate Man-Eating Wolves!
    —— A Complaint from Zhou Zhimin, a Worker at the Tianjin Steel Factory
    Recorded by Huang Mao
    When I was nineteen, I worked in Changchun, Northeast China. One day, I went to the street to buy something, and I met a Japanese policeman on the way. He asked me, "What are you doing? Come here! Come here!" He called me into a room. When I got inside, I saw a room full of people, all tied up with ropes. Later, they were led out one by one, pushed onto a car, and taken to the main police station, where they were interrogated and checked one by one. After that, we were taken to Mopan Prison and locked up. There, we got a wooden box of red sorghum rice every day, with no vegetables and no water. If we were thirsty, we drank water from the latrine. Anyone who spoke was dragged out and whipped with a leather whip. After staying there for four days, we were sent to a training camp. In the training camp, two people shared one pair of handcuffs; we had to report even when stretching our legs at night. Some compatriots' wrists were swollen, and anyone who touched their wrists would be beaten if seen, because they would say you were trying to escape. Even going to the toilet required two people, one defecating and the other squatting. After a few days, we were transported by train to the Mishan coal mining area. When we arrived at the Mishan mining area, we were pushed one by one into the electric fence. The electric fence was 3,300 horsepower, more than one person high. Throwing green grass on it would set it on fire; even urinating close to the electric fence could electrocute you. There, we only got two small cornbread buns mixed with acorn flour for each meal, each weighing no more than two or three ounces. We still had to work hard. We were starving, and if we couldn't work, we would be beaten. The place where we slept every day was unheated, it was a cement floor, ice cold. At night, even in the dead of winter, we had to go out naked, without wearing any clothes. Even if we went out in only our underpants, we would be severely beaten by the Japanese devils and their Chinese collaborators upon returning. Some were beaten to death like this. Others froze to death outside. Some workers were sick for four or five days without eating anything, becoming nothing but skeletons. Even when sick, we had to work. Every day, the Japanese devils and their running dogs would inspect us, saying, "If you have a hard head, you have to work." If we didn't go, we would be beaten one by one; some were beaten to death and dragged outside. The Japanese devils said, "Death, death, it doesn't matter. More will come, bigger ones will come." At our work site alone, one or twenty people were beaten to death, frozen to death, starved to death, electrocuted, crushed to death, or died of illness every day. When people died, their corpses were piled on the side, some with clenched teeth, some with staring eyes. Even in death, the workers hated the Japanese devils so much. They used horse-drawn carts to drag the dead to the bottom of the mountain to feed the wolves. Later, too many died, so they burned the bodies. Some workers ran away, but if they were caught by the Japanese devils, they would be force-fed chili water, electrocuted, or have their feet crushed in clamps.
    Once, I had a stomach ache and couldn't work, I couldn't even stand up. The Japanese devils and their collaborators said I was faking sickness and beat me until I passed out. I fell to the ground, my clothes were all wet, and I sweated a few times. I stayed in the pit for a night, and at dawn, they dragged me to the pit entrance again. It was the dead of winter then, and the weather in the Northeast was so cold! My wet clothes were all frozen stiff, and I was also frozen to death. Later, the workers carried me to the sleeping quarters, and they covered me with some clothes and felt mats, and I slowly came back to life. But the Japanese devils and their collaborators still forced me to work, and when I couldn't, they beat me again. The workers secretly said to me behind the backs of the Japanese devils and their collaborators, "Old Zhou, don't be sad, we must persevere, we will eventually get out one day." "When we turn over, we will cut those bastards to pieces with knives, piece by piece."
    The mine was a killing field. When people died and were gone, they would go and grab more. On average, they grabbed two hundred people every three months. I heard from the workers that Chinese people were captured by the Japanese devils to do secret military work, and after they finished the work, they disappeared. They were afraid of leaks, so they were all killed.
    One day, another group was sent in, and the family of a worker also came from Changchun, following him to find her husband. There were six people in their family, relying on her husband alone to support them. There was an elderly mother in her seventies or eighties, a little girl of seven or eight, a little boy of five, and a little girl of two. The worker's wife came with her five-year-old son, and when she saw that her husband had been beaten to death by the Japanese devils, she cried. The workers persuaded her, "Don't cry, go back to Changchun!" She had a cerebral hemorrhage and died as soon as she returned to the station. They didn't even buy her a coffin, but wrapped her in a straw mat and dragged her to a mountain ditch to feed the wolves. The five-year-old child returned to the electric fence, crying every day for his mother and father, and died after a few days. Which parents don't love their children, and which children don't miss their parents! The workers in the mine gritted their teeth and said, "Damn it, they made our Chinese people lose their families and die. What about his seventy or eighty-year-old grandmother and his two or three-year-old little girl?! How can a two-year-old child who is breastfeeding leave his mother?"
    Every worker in the mine missed his family every moment. The workers would talk nonsense in their sleep. Some said, "My mother is here." Some said, "My child is here." Some said, "My wife knows I'm hungry and cold, and she's bringing me food and clothes." Others were driven crazy. Some workers were from inside the pass, and they knew that the Eighth Route Army treated the people well, and the Japanese devils treated us cruelly. They were always looking forward to their own troops coming to rescue us, like waiting for the stars and the moon. We stayed in this hell for more than a year. One day, someone secretly told us that Soviet planes were coming. But the Japanese devils said it was an air defense drill. The next morning, we saw that all the people outside the electric fence had run away. We inside the electric fence didn't know what was going on. The devils were all running towards the railway line, but they were holding their bayonets and ordering us to go into the mountains. We thought: why don't they let us go towards the railway line, but let us go into the mountains? It turned out that the Japanese devils had two intentions: one was that they saw that we were many and they were few, and they were afraid that we would go along the railway and encircle them, killing them; the other was that they wanted tens of thousands of Chinese laborers to go into the mountains, not knowing the roads, so they could starve us to death. Later, we arrived at Boli County in Songjiang Province. We stayed in Boli County for two days and then went to Yilan County. Just near Yilan, we saw four planes dropping bombs to the northwest. Someone said, "These are Soviet planes." The planes dropped many leaflets on us, all printed with large red letters, which read: "Chinese friends, don't be afraid, we don't hit Chinese people, we are here to liberate you. Those who have families, go home, and those who don't, work here." At the end was a large stamp of the Soviet Red Army Headquarters. We all jumped up happily. We knew that the Soviet Red Army had come to liberate us. We left the mine after five or six days, and when we arrived at Yilan County, we saw the Japanese devils grabbing our people's carts, pulling things and fleeing in a panic. We saw that all the Japanese military bases had been bombed. When we arrived at the Songhua River bank, we saw that all the Japanese devils' ships had also been bombed and sunk by the Soviet planes. The next morning, we went to the river bank and suddenly heard cannons and machine guns in the northeast corner. We squatted under the bridge on the river bank and watched. We saw the Soviet planes flying over the Japanese warehouse in the west, rumbling and rumbling. The shells and bombs fell on the enemy's heads, and smoke billowed like a boiling pot. The Japanese devils were so scared that they shit and pissed, crawling, running, rolling, crying, dying, and jumping into the river. We were really happy, thinking: "This time, we are avenged, we are relieved." After a while, the guns stopped firing. I said to an old man sitting next to me, "Let's go and greet the Soviet Red Army!" We waved our handkerchiefs and entered the earth city. When we arrived in the earth city, we saw that the Soviet Red Army was so big and majestic, smiling at us. Everyone carried wheel guns, with dozens of bullets loaded in one wheel. When we arrived in the street, we saw the Soviet Red Army's tanks, one after another, all over the street. There were many styles of cars, some were cars on the shore and boats in the river, really good.
    A large red flag was hung on the city of Yilan County.
    Then, the Soviet Red Army helped us establish trade unions, providing relief to unemployed workers. Those who were doing business were told to do business well, those who were going to school were told to go to school well, and they also helped us establish security teams and people's self-government armies. I worked as a carpenter for the Red Army there. The Red Army treated our workers especially well, like brothers. My whole family was reunited, and many Chinese people were also reunited. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we turned over and became masters of our own destiny, and our lives improved. My two older brothers and one younger brother all work for the country. My wife and I, who had been separated for seven or eight years, also got back together, and we had a son, who is less than one year old, and is white and fat.
    The Chinese people have stood up. We want to thank Chairman Mao, thank the People's Liberation Army, thank Marshal Stalin, and thank the great Soviet Red Army.
    Now, American imperialism is rearming Japan. American imperialism, this vicious wolf, wants to revive the Japanese fascist wolf and eat us together. We are human, can we let wolves eat us? Do we still want to be cattle and horses, slaves of a conquered country? Do we still want our parents, wives, brothers, and sisters to be slaughtered and raped at will? Do we still want our houses, clothes, and property to be forcibly occupied? I now express my firm support for the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact and oppose American imperialism's rearming of Japan.

　　我们要坚决消灭吃人的恶狼！
    ——天津钢厂工友周致敏的控诉
    黄矛记录
    我十九岁那年在东北长春做工。有一天，我上街去买东西，路上遇见个日本警察，他问我：“干什么的，这边来！这边来！”说着就把我叫到屋里去啦。我到屋里一看，一屋子的人，全拿绳子给绑住啦。后来一个个被牵着推上汽车，装到了大警察厅，挨个问，挨个检查。过后，又把我们弄到磨盘监狱给押起来。在那儿，每天一木头盒红高粱米饭，没有菜，也没有水，口渴啦，取茅房里的水喝。谁要是说话就拉出去用皮鞭子抽。在那儿呆了四天，又被送到训练所。进了训练所，两个人一个手铐子、黑夜伸腿也得报告。有的同胞手腕子都肿啦，谁要摸摸手腕子，被看见就挨揍，说你要跑。如上茅房，也得两个人去，一个大便，一个蹲着。过了几天就用火车把我们押送到密山煤矿区。到了密山矿区，把我们一个个押进电网里去。电网是三千三马力的，一人多高，青草往那一扔就着，要是小便离电网近些也会把你电死。在那儿，一顿饭只给两个高粱米面、玉米面掺橡子面的小窝窝头吃，一个最多也不过是二、三两重。干活还得多干，捱着饿，干不动还得揍你。每天睡觉的地方不生火，是洋灰地，冰凉。黑夜出去，三九天，都得光着身子，一点衣服都不让穿，就是穿裤衩出去，回来时鬼子、汉奸们也要把你毒打一顿，有些就是这样被打死的。还有的是到外边就冻死啦。有的工友病了四、五天不吃东西，瘦得光剩骨头架子啦。病了也得干。每天鬼子、汉奸走狗还要检查，他们说：“脑瓜子硬就得干。”不去，挨着个打，有的被打死就拉到外边去。日本鬼子说：“死啦死啦没关系，死啦的，慢慢的大大的来。”光我们干活的地点，被打死、冻死、饿死、电死、砸死、病死的，每天就有一、二十口子。人死啦，就把死尸堆在一边，有的咬着牙，有的瞪着眼，工友们已经死啦，还是那么恨日本鬼子。他们用马车把死人拉到山底下喂狼去，后来，死的太多啦，就用火烧。有的工友跑啦，被日本鬼子抓回来，就灌辣椒水、过电、上夹板夹脚。
    有一回，我肚子疼，实在干不了活，连站都站不起来，鬼子、汉奸们说我装病，把我打得都昏过去啦。我倒在地上，衣服全湿啦，里面出了几道汗，在坑里呆了一宿，赶天明，他们又把我拉上坑口来。那时正是三九天，东北天气多冷呀！我的湿衣服全冻硬啦，我也被冻得死了过去。过后，工友们把我架到睡觉的房里，他们给我盖上点衣服毡子，人才慢慢还过来。可是鬼子、汉奸还强迫我干活，干不了，又把我打了一顿。工友们背着鬼子、汉奸们对我说：“老周，你别难过，咱们要坚持，咱们总归有出去的一天。”“等我们翻身的时候，我们用刀子一刀一刀的剐了那些王八蛋。”
    矿山就是一个杀人场，人死啦，没啦，他们就去抓。平均每三个月去二百。我听工友说，中国的老百姓被日本鬼子抓去做军事秘密工作，完了活，人也不见，他们怕走漏消息，全给弄死啦。
    有一天，又送来一批，有一个工友的家眷也从长春跟着来啦，是来找他的丈夫的。他们家一共有六口人，指望他丈夫一个人维持生活，有七、八十岁的老母亲，有七、八岁的小姑娘，有五岁的小小子，还有两岁的小闺女。这个工友的媳妇是带着五岁的小小子来的，一看，他的丈夫已经被日本鬼子打死啦，就直哭。工友们劝他说：“别哭，你还是回长春去吧！”她一回到车站就得脑充血死啦。连口棺材也不给买，弄个席卷拉到山沟里喂了狼。五岁的小孩回到电网里来，每天哭着要找他娘、找他爹，过几天也死了。谁家的父母不疼自己的孩子，谁家的孩子不想爹娘呀！矿坑的工友们都咬牙切齿的说：“操他妈的，弄的我们中国老百姓家败人亡，他家七、八十岁的老太太，两三岁的小闺女，你说怎么办？！两岁吃奶的小孩能离开娘吗？”
    矿坑里每一个工友没有一时不想念自己的家的，工友们睡觉气的直说胡话。有的说：“我妈妈来啦。”有的说：“我孩子来啦。”有的说：“我媳妇知道我饿着、冻着，给我送饭来啦、送衣服来啦。”还有的是给气疯了。有的工友是关内人，知道八路军对待老百姓好，日本鬼子对待我们毒辣，没有一时不像盼星星、盼月亮似的盼着自己的队伍来解救我们的。我们在这地狱里呆了一年多。有一天，有人暗地里告诉我们说，苏联飞机过来啦。但日本鬼子说是防空演习。过了一宿，天明了，我们看见电网外面的老百姓全都跑啦，我们在电网里边也不知道是怎么回事。鬼子们全都奔铁道线走，可是他们举着枪刺却命令我们往山里走。我们心想：他们为什么不让我们奔铁道线走，而让我们奔大山里走呢？原来日本鬼子有两个用意：一个是看我们人多，他们人少，怕我们顺铁道走来个大包围，把他们弄死；一个是想让我们几万个中国劳工往大山走，不认识道路好把我们饿死。后来到了松江省勃利县，我们在勃利县住了两天，就上依兰县去了。刚到依兰附近，看见有四架飞机往西北边扔炸弹，有人说：“这是苏联飞机。”飞机向我们撒了许多传单，传单上印的全是很大的红字，写着：“中国的朋友们，你们不要害怕，我们不打中国人，我们是来解放你们的。有家的还家，没家的在这边工作。”最后盖的是苏联红军司令部的大图章。我们大家都欢喜的跳起来啦。我们这才知道苏联红军来解放我们了。我们打矿山出来有五、六天，到了依兰县，看见日本鬼子正抓我们老百姓的车，拉着东西狼狈逃命。我们看见日本军事基地全给炸啦。到了松花江岸一看，日本鬼子的船也全给苏联飞机炸沉了。第二天早晨，我们上了江岸，忽听得东北角上响起大炮、机关枪，我们在江岸桥底下蹲着看。看见西边日本大仓库上头，苏联飞机轰隆轰隆的飞来啦，炮弹、炸弹，落在敌人的头上，像开锅一样直冒烟。日本鬼子被打得屎滚尿流，爬的爬，跑的跑，滚的滚，哭的哭，死的死，还有跳到江里去的。我们真高兴，心想：“这会，给我们报仇啦，给我们出气啦。”一会儿，枪炮不响啦。我跟坐在我身边的一个老头说：“咱们去迎接苏联红军去吧！”我们摇着手巾往土城里进，我们到土城里一看，苏联红军那么大个，真威武，冲着我们直笑，他们每个人带的都是轮子枪，一个轮子装好几十颗子弹。我们到街里，看见苏联红军的坦克，一辆跟着一辆，满街都是。汽车的样式也多，有的上岸就是汽车，下到江里就是船，真好。
    依兰县城上挂着一面大红旗。
    接着，苏联红军就帮助我们成立工会，救济失业工人，叫做生意的好好做生意，上学的好好上学，还帮助我们成立了保安队、人民自治军。我在那儿给红军做木匠活，红军对咱们工人特别好，像亲兄弟一般。我们一家子也都团圆啦，许多中国人民也都团圆啦。我们在中国共产党领导下翻身当了主人，生活改善啦。我两个哥哥，一个弟弟都给国家工作，我跟我媳妇离了七、八年也到一起啦，还生了一个男孩，不到一周岁，长得又白又胖的。
    中国人民已经站起来啦。我们要感谢毛主席，感谢人民解放军，感谢斯大林大元帅，感谢伟大的苏联红军。
    这会，美帝国主义又在武装日本了，美帝国主义这个狠心狼想把日本法西斯这条病狼治活啦，一块儿来吃我们。咱们是人，能让狼吃吗？难道咱们还乐意当牛马，当亡国奴吗？难道咱们还乐意让自己的父母、妻子、兄弟、姊妹给人家随意屠杀、强奸吗？难道咱们的房子、衣服、财产还乐意让人家强占吗？我现在表示坚决拥护缔结五大国和平公约，反对美帝国主义武装日本。
