Worker-Respected Teacher Liu Shaofeng
    Duan Lian
    In the past six months, the Yangquan Yugong Coal Mine has organized nearly 500 employees to participate in spare-time studies under extremely difficult conditions.

    When Comrade Liu Shaofeng started organizing the spare-time school in June last year, the difficulties he encountered were: most of the workers lived more than ten li away from the mine; and most of them were part-time workers and part-time farmers, digging coal in winter and planting crops in the spring, working in the morning and collecting manure in the afternoon. He promoted the idea of learning to read and write to everyone, but when he met older workers, they would say: "We are about to die, what's the point of learning culture?" Younger workers said: "We were born as coal miners, do you think we can become dragons and phoenixes?"

    Based on the workers' ideological characteristics, in addition to general mobilization at the pithead, Comrade Lao Liu also dug coal and pushed carts with the workers. In the workers' dormitories, Lao Liu lay on the workers' bedding and chatted with them, conducting painstaking and patient persuasion and education. In this way, after about twenty days, "Lao Liu" became the most familiar name among the workers, and he made many friends.

    Then, through his friends—activists—he cultivated typical groups and expanded outwards in a "string of melons" manner, cultivating activists at any time and helping them solve their work difficulties in a timely manner. On this basis, he further carried out ideological mobilization and organized cultural grievances. Everyone realized: in the past, capitalists did not allow workers to learn culture because it was convenient for them to exploit us workers. Therefore, 204 people signed up to participate in the study at once. But the second difficulty came, and in less than ten days, only forty-odd people were left. Comrade Lao Liu was not discouraged by this. He delved into the reasons and found that after a day of intense labor, the workers would get off work immediately and go to class without even eating, and after class, they had to run a long way home, and they couldn't get enough rest.

    Based on this situation, Lao Liu obtained the approval of the leadership and established branch schools in the concentrated residential areas of the workers. Those who lived in the mine took classes in the club. But difficulties came again, how to solve the problem of desks and chairs in the classroom? Comrade Lao Liu, regardless of the hardship, discussed with the local village head, civil education committee members, and teachers, and borrowed the address of the elementary school, which solved the problem. Activists mobilized everywhere, and this time, 40% of the mine's employees voluntarily signed up to participate in the study.

    In order to better consolidate the study, symposiums including advanced, intermediate, and backward elements are often held. After half a year of study, the most illiterate have learned to recognize up to 500 characters, and the least have learned more than 200 characters. Tang Guangren, a 52-year-old worker, recognized 300 characters. He said, "I will never stare blankly at the women's toilet again."

　　工人敬爱的教师刘少峰
    段涟
    阳泉裕公煤矿，半年来在极端困难的条件下，已组织了将近五百职工参加了业余学习。
    刘少峰同志去年六月间开始组织业余学校时所遇到的困难是：工友们离矿多半是十几里路；又大都是半工半农，冬天挖煤，开春种地，前半天做工，后半天拾粪。他向大家宣传学文化，可是碰到老年工人开口就是：“咱已经是快死的人啦，学习文化干啥？”壮年工人说：“咱生来是个煤黑子，还想成龙变凤？”
    根据工人的思想特点，老刘同志除作一般的坑口动员之外，还和工友一道挖煤、推车。在工人宿舍里，老刘躺在工友的被窝上谈天，进行了苦口婆心的说服教育。这样，经过二十天光景，“老刘”便成为工友中最熟悉的名字，交了很多朋友。
    接着他就通过自己的朋友——积极分子，培养典型小组，“串瓜蔓”式地向外扩大，随时培养积极分子，及时帮助解决他们在工作上的困难。在这个基础上，进一步进行了思想发动，组织了文化诉苦。大家都想通了：过去资本家不让工人学文化，原是为了便于剥削咱工人的。因此，报名参加学习的，一下就有二百零四人。但第二个困难又来了，不到十天工夫，垮得只剩下四十几个人。老刘同志并不为此灰心。他深入了解，原来工友们紧张的劳动上一天，马上下工，连饭都不吃就上课，上完课，又要跑老远路回家，休息不过来。
    根据这个情况，老刘得到领导上同意，就在工友集中住区分别建立分校。矿上住宿的就在俱乐部上课。可是困难又来了，教室桌椅如何解决呢？老刘同志不怕辛苦地和当地村长、民教委员、教员商议，借用小学校地址，解决了这个问题。积极分子又到处动员，这次自动报名参加学习的占全矿职工百分之四十。
    为了更好地巩固学习，经常召开包括先进、中间、落后分子的座谈会。经过半年学习，文盲最多已有识到五百字的，最少的也在二百字以上。五十二岁老工友唐广仁认识了三百字，他说：“我再不瞪着眼睛到女厕所去了。”
