Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. According to TASS, Marshal Vasilevsky, the Soviet Minister of the Army, delivered a speech at the parade in Moscow's Red Square on the 1st, stating that under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people have victoriously completed the post-war Five-Year Plan. The Soviet economy has embarked on a new high tide, with all industrial sectors developing on a large scale, and the collective farms' public economy is prospering and consolidating. National income is increasing year by year, and the people's living standards are continuously improving. New achievements have also been made in the development of culture, science, and art. As we move towards communism, the lofty and intelligent qualities of the Soviet people are becoming increasingly apparent, and the people's awareness and creativity are growing.

While the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are fully developing their economies and cultures, the capitalist countries, headed by the American imperialists, are stepping up preparations for a new world war. For ten months, American imperialism has been waging a war of aggression against the freedom-loving Korean people. This unjust war will never bring benefits to the American people. The American imperialists will not be able to conceal the crisis of their policy of aggression, and all their clumsy attempts to justify their setbacks in Korea will ultimately be in vain. The imperialist policy of aggression is causing increasing dissatisfaction among the broad masses of the people, and the movement to defend peace is growing. The Soviet government has always firmly pursued a policy of preventing war and maintaining peace, and has won the support of progressive people all over the world. The Soviet people, closely united around their leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, will devote all their strength to further consolidating the strength of the motherland and building communism. The glorious Soviet armed forces are guarding the interests of the country and the constructive labor of the people. The Soviet people can fully rely on the Soviet Army and Navy, which are always ready to gloriously fulfill their duty to the motherland.

　　在莫斯科红场阅兵时华西列夫斯基发表演说
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联陆军部长，苏联元帅华西列夫斯基一日在莫斯科红场阅兵时发表演说称：苏联人民在列宁——斯大林党的领导下，已胜利地完成了战后五年计划。苏联的经济已走上了新的高潮，各工业部门正在大规模地发展，集体农场的公有经济正在繁荣巩固。国民收入逐年增加，人民生活水平在不断改善。在发展文化、科学和艺术方面也有了新的成就。随着我们向共产主义迈进的步伐，苏维埃人民的崇高和智慧的品质愈来愈明显地发挥出来，人民的觉悟和创造性日渐增加着。
    正当苏联和人民民主国家全力发展经济与文化的时候，以美帝国主义者为首的资本主义国家却在加紧准备新的世界大战。十个月来，美帝国主义一直在对爱好自由的朝鲜人民进行着侵略战争。这个非正义的战争永远不会给美国人民带来好处。美帝国主义者将无法掩盖他们侵略政策的危机，他们想辩解他们在朝鲜遭受的挫败的一切笨拙办法终究是徒劳的。帝国主义的侵略政策在广大人民当中引起了日益加深的不满，保卫和平的运动正在增长着。苏联政府始终坚定不移地奉行着防止战争、维护和平的政策，而且得到了全世界进步人类的拥护。紧密团结在自己的领袖和导师斯大林同志周围的苏联人民，将把全部力量贡献给进一步巩固祖国威力和建设共产主义的事业。光荣的苏联武装部队警卫着国家的利益与人民的建设性劳动。苏联人民完全可以信赖苏联的陆军和海军，他们随时都在准备着光荣地完成对祖国的职责。
