　　International Film Festival Authorities Illegally Ban Screening of "Liberated China"
    The International Film Festival was held in Cannes, France, in early April. Delegations from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries participated in the film festival and were warmly welcomed by the film industry. This truly international film festival caused panic among reactionary groups, because they originally hoped to turn this gathering of international film workers into a regular commercial gathering for Hollywood. During the festival, the screenings of six Soviet films, two Polish films, two Czech films, and one Hungarian film generated strong interest among the audience. Western films that glorified crime, adultery, and base instincts were disgusted by progressive people. The Soviet delegation received courteous hospitality and a moving welcome from the French people. Participants in the festival were particularly eager to screen "Liberated China," which had already been included in the program, but the festival organizing committee temporarily and illegally decided to ban the screening of this film. This shameless decision was obviously executed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the instructions of American imperialists. This matter aroused great indignation in all quarters. The Soviet delegation lodged a strong protest; delegations participating in the festival went to the festival organizing committee one after another, demanding the cancellation of this decision; progressive organizations in Cannes distributed many protest leaflets in the city; representatives of various groups and individuals constantly approached the Soviet delegation, expressing their support for the Soviet delegation and expressing their anger at the measures taken by the French authorities to damage Franco-Soviet cultural relations. Under the pressure of justice from all walks of life, the festival authorities had to allow the film to be screened to 175 journalists from France and other countries. They warmly welcomed this film reflecting the new China.

　　国际电影赛会当局非法禁演《解放了的中国》
    国际电影赛会于四月初在法国戛纳举行。苏联和其他人民民主国家的代表团参加了这次的电影赛会，受到电影界热烈欢迎。这个具有真正国际性质的电影赛会，引起了反动集团的慌乱，因为他们原希望把这个国际电影工作者的聚会，变为好莱坞的定期商业集会。在赛会中，六部苏联影片、两部波兰影片、两部捷克影片和一部匈牙利影片的放映，使观众产生了强烈的兴趣。西方颂扬犯罪、奸淫和颂扬卑劣本能的影片，遭到进步人士的厌恶。苏联代表团受到了法国人民的殷勤招待和动人的欢迎。参加赛会的人们特别希望放映已经列在节目中的《解放了的中国》，但赛会组织委员会却临时非法决定禁止放映这部影片。这个无耻决定，显然是法国外交部受了美帝国主义者的指使而执行的。这件事引起了各方面极大的愤慨。苏联代表团提出强硬抗议；参加赛会的各代表团纷纷到赛会的组织委员会去，要求取消这项决定；戛纳的进步组织在该城散发了许多份抗议传单；各团体的代表和个人不断来找苏联代表团，表示他们支持苏联代表团，并对法国当局旨在损害法苏文化关系的措施表示愤怒。在各界人士正义的压力下，赛会当局不得不允许把此片放映给一百七十五位法国及其他国家的各报记者看。他们热烈欢迎这部反映新中国的影片。
