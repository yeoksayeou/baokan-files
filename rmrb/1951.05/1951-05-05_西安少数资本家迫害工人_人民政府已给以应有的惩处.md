To the Editor:

The article "Xi'an Minority Capitalists Persecute Workers, Trade Union Demands Government to Punish Them" published in your newspaper's "Reader's Letters" page on March 7th is factually accurate. The matter has been appropriately addressed. In addition to educating Shan Qingchun and Shan Qingwen, managers of the Masheng Shop, and He Zhenxiang, manager of Zhenhua Textile Factory, who mistreated workers, the Xi'an Municipal Labor Bureau, based on the reasonable demands of the workers, sentenced Shan Qingwen to one year and two months in prison for directly torturing apprentices with feudal barbaric means. Shan Qingchun groundlessly accused apprentices of stealing and allowed his younger brother to illegally torture workers, and has been sentenced to six months of labor service. He Zhenxiang, manager of Zhenhua Textile Factory, not only violated labor policies but also committed the criminal offense of obstructing official duties, and has been sentenced to two months of labor service according to law. Shoe contractor Shen Lujia absconded with funds after the trade union exposed his crimes. Other unscrupulous capitalists, such as Jianhua Tea House and Tianfeng Soy Sauce Garden, have been criticized and educated by the Municipal Shop Employees' Union. They are now conscientiously abiding by the collective contract and gradually changing their practice of oppressing workers.

It has been nearly two years since the liberation of our city. Although our trade union work has been successful, there are still many shortcomings. For example, we have not fully mobilized the more scattered handicraft shop employees and apprentices, educated them to establish a sense of ownership, and fought against feudal forces. In the future, we will go deep into the grassroots, strengthen organizational education, lead the worker masses to resolutely fight against these illegal behaviors, and establish a democratic and equal labor-capital relationship.

### 西安少数资本家迫害工人  人民政府已给以应有的惩处

　　西安少数资本家迫害工人
    人民政府已给以应有的惩处编辑同志：
    贵报三月七日“读者来信专页”中刊登的“西安少数资本家迫害工人，工会要求政府给以惩处”一稿，所述内容都是真实的。此事已予以适当处理。西安市劳动局除对虐待工人的麻绳铺经理善青春、善青文，振华纺织厂经理何振祥等，进行教育外，西安市人民法院根据工人的合理要求，对直接以封建野蛮手段拷打学徒的善青文判处徒刑一年零两个月，善青春无故诬赖学徒偷窃，并放纵他的弟弟非法拷打工人，已被判处劳役六个月。振华纺织厂经理何振祥不但违反劳动政策，且已构成妨害公务刑事罪，依法判处劳役两个月。制鞋包工头申禄加，当工会揭发其罪恶后已携款潜逃。其他如建华茶庄，天丰酱园等不法资方，均由本市店员联合会作了批评教育。现在他们已切实按照集体合同办事，逐渐改变压迫工人的作风。
    本市解放将近两年，我们工会工作虽有成绩，但缺点还多，例如，没有把较分散的手工业店员学徒充分发动起来，教育他们树立主人翁的思想，与封建势力作斗争。今后我们要深入基层，加强组织教育，领导工人群众坚决与这些非法行为作斗争，建立民主平等的劳资关系。
