In early April this year, when the blood-debt-laden Kuomintang special agent Zeng Xiancheng was arrested and brought to justice, the people in the counties near Zhongxiang, Hubei Province, were overjoyed, spreading the good news everywhere: "Zeng Hei Zi (Zeng bandit's nickname) has been caught!" and "Zeng Hei Zi will be publicly tried on May 1st!" More than a thousand letters of accusation were submitted to the People's Government from various places. In the days before the public trial, people from rural areas dozens of miles away rushed to Zhongxiang County town, carrying dry rations.

The bandit Zeng Xiancheng joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret service organization very early and served as the bandit "Commander of the Third Advance Column of the Fifth War Zone with the rank of Major General" and "Deputy Commander of the Hubei Provincial Security Command." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the bandit Zeng colluded with the Japanese invaders and puppet troops, engaging in burning, killing, looting, and destroying the lives and property of the people in Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Jingmen, Hongshan, Yicheng, Zao yang, Hanyang, and Hanchuan. Incomplete statistics for only a few years before and after the Japanese surrender show that the bandit Zeng killed and buried alive more than 3,490 people in Zhongxiang and Jingmen counties and the Fengle and Zhangjiaji districts of Hongshan County; in Zhongxiang County, he conscripted 728 young men, raped more than 260 women, robbed more than 1.5 million catties of grain, more than 5,600 livestock, and extorted more than 198,000 silver dollars.

On May 1st, before dawn, people poured into the square south of Zhongxiang City. After celebrating "May Day," the public trial began. The bandit Zeng Xiancheng was escorted into the venue and knelt before more than 30,000 people. Many orphans and widows dressed in mourning clothes, holding memorial tablets, and the masses at the meeting, shouted in unison: "Skin him alive!" "Avenge the dead!" Shao Zongjiang, the guard of Comrade Kang Shangxiang, a martyr and leader of a certain regiment of the former Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, accused the bandit Zeng of beating Comrade Kang Shangxiang to death, cutting off his head, and beating Comrade Kang's father and wife to death and scalding them to death with boiling water. Shao Zongjiang pointed at the bandit Zeng with gnashing teeth and said, "This blood feud cannot be repaid even if you are cut into a thousand pieces!" When Chen Fulin, a seven-year-old girl wearing mourning clothes, grabbed Zeng bandit and demanded that he repay her father's life debt, people on and off the stage shouted: "Blood debts must be paid in blood!" "Avenge little sister Chen Fulin!"

The Zhongxiang County People's Court immediately sentenced the bandit Zeng Xiancheng to death based on his crimes and the demands of the people. With the approval of the higher-level People's Government, he was escorted to the martyrs' tombs to be executed by firing squad.

　　湖北钟祥县三万多人公审特务匪徒曾宪成
    今年四月初，当血债累累的国民党特务曾宪成被逮捕归案后，湖北省钟祥附近各县的人民都欢欣若狂，到处传报着“抓到曾黑子（曾匪的混名）了”和“五月一日公审曾黑子”的喜讯。一千多封控诉书，从各地递交到人民政府。公审前几天，各地人民就背着干粮，从几十里外的农村赶到钟祥县城。
    曾匪宪成很早就加入了蒋匪特务组织，曾任匪“第五战区第三挺进纵队少将司令”、“湖北省保安司令部副司令”等职。抗日战争期中，曾匪与日寇、伪军勾结，在钟祥、京山、荆门、洪山、宜城、枣阳、汉阳、汉川一带，烧杀抢掠，损害人民的生命财产难以数计。仅日寇投降前后数年内的不完全统计，曾匪在钟祥、荆门两县和洪山县丰乐、张家集两区即杀害和活埋三千四百九十余人；在钟祥县拉走壮丁七百二十八人，强奸妇女二百六十余人，抢劫粮食一百五十余万斤，牲畜五千六百多只，勒索银洋十九万八千余元。
    五月一日，天还未亮，人们就涌进了钟祥城南的广场内。在举行了庆祝“五一”节后，公审大会随即开始。曾匪宪成被押进会场，跪在三万多人面前。许多身穿孝衣、手捧灵牌的孤儿、寡妇和到会群众，都齐声高呼：“剥他的皮！”“为死难者报仇！”前新四军第五师某团首长康上项烈士的警卫员邵宗江，控诉曾匪把康上项烈士打死后，又割掉了他的头，还把康烈士的父亲和妻子活活打死和用开水烫死。邵宗江自己的叔父也被曾匪剁成肉块。邵宗江咬牙切齿地指着曾匪说：“这种血海深仇，就是把你千刀万剐也不能偿还的！”当穿着孝衣年方七岁的陈福林，抓着曾匪要他偿还自己父亲的命债时，台上台下高呼：“血债要用血来还！”“为陈福林小妹妹复仇！”
    钟祥县人民法庭当即根据曾匪的罪行和人民要求，判处曾匪死刑，并经上级人民政府批准，押赴受害者灵前执行枪决。
