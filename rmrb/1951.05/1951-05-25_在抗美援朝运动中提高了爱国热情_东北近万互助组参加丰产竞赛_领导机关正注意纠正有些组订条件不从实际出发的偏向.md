Having heightened patriotic enthusiasm in the campaign to Resist America, Aid Korea,
Nearly Ten Thousand Mutual Aid Teams in Northeast China Participate in Bumper Harvest Competition
Leading Organs Are Paying Attention to Correcting the Tendency of Some Teams to Set Conditions That Do Not Conform to Reality

In the Northeast region, nearly ten thousand agricultural production mutual aid teams have participated in the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement. This movement has not only promoted the timely spring plowing and sowing of farmers throughout the region, and the planting of more special crops and commercial grain, but has also made farmers pay attention to improving technology, demanding good planting and more planting. The original plan for the Lüda area this year was to plant 6,000 hectares of cotton, but as a result of the production competition carried out throughout the area, the current cotton field area has reached 6,500 to 7,000 hectares. Farmers in the southern regions of Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces have been swept up in a surge of planting upland crops such as sorghum, corn, and millet. Wheat in Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces was basically planted by mid-April, and generally exceeded the plan. In terms of technology improvement, 85 percent of wheat, sorghum, and millet seeds in 23 villages in the seventh district of Qinglong County, Hebei Province, were disinfected. The cotton fields of the Chen Xingren mutual aid team in Jin County, Lüda area, have been expanded from the past one foot six inches wide to one foot eight inches, and the plant spacing of cotton seedlings has also been shortened from nine inches to seven inches. In other places, many mutual aid team cotton fields are ploughed five minutes to one inch deeper than last year.

In carrying out the bumper harvest movement, all localities have combined it with ideological education on resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the home, and defending the country. First, labor models or model mutual aid teams took the lead, and with the mutual aid team as the center, the mass bumper harvest competition movement was gradually carried out on a village-by-village basis. For example, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, used various meetings and methods, combined with patriotic education, to implement the idea of bumper harvest competition among farmers. Then, it specifically mobilized mutual aid teams with the same production conditions and organizational foundation to brew competition to promote the general. By late April, 1,500 mutual aid teams in the county had launched a competition. After Panshi County in the same province mobilized the Madejiang, Mawanxiang, and Sunhai groups to respond to challenges and challenges, a large number of cadres were then organized to go deep into the mutual aid teams to carry out current affairs propaganda and education, encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses, and then help the mutual aid teams to study and formulate plans and launch competitions. According to incomplete statistics from the county on April 25, more than 1,700 mutual aid teams have been swept into the heat of the competition.

At present, the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement in the Northeast region, although it has gradually deepened in areas with a better foundation and in better mutual aid teams and villages, most areas have only made general appeals and have not carried out the movement well. The main reason is that some rural cadres have a vague understanding of the patriotic bumper harvest movement and lack methods. In some areas, after mobilizing several model mutual aid teams to formulate plans and propose responses to challenges and challenges, they believed that the bumper harvest movement had been launched, and did not go deep into promoting the general, so that this movement was still limited to the scope of competition among a few model mutual aid teams; even some mutual aid teams, when formulating bumper harvest plans and proposing competition conditions, did not proceed from reality, encompassing everything, and simply compared the conditions in form; or blindly mobilized to plant early and plant fast, violating the masses' requirements for timely sowing and good planting. The above-mentioned deviations are being corrected by leadership organs at all levels in the Northeast region, so as to enable the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement to be widely carried out throughout the region.

　　在抗美援朝运动中提高了爱国热情
    东北近万互助组参加丰产竞赛
    领导机关正注意纠正有些组订条件不从实际出发的偏向
    东北区已有近万个农业生产互助组参加了爱国丰产竞赛运动。这种运动，不仅推动了全区农民及时春耕播种，多种特产作物和商品粮食，而且使农民注意改进技术，要求种的好、种的多。旅大地区原计划今年植棉六千垧，但由于全区开展生产竞赛的结果，现棉田面积已达六千五百垧至七千垧。辽东、辽西两省南部地区农民已卷入播种高粱、苞米、谷子等大田作物的热潮。松江、黑龙江两省的小麦已于四月中旬基本种完，且普遍超过计划。在改进技术方面，热河省青龙县七区二十三个村百分之八十五的小麦、高粱、谷子的种籽都消了毒。旅大地区金县陈行仁互助组的棉田，由过去一尺六寸宽的垅扩大到一尺八寸，棉苗株距亦由九寸缩短到七寸。其他各地很多互助组棉田都比去年深耕五分到一寸。
    各地在开展丰产运动中，均结合抗美援朝保家卫国的思想教育，首先通过劳动模范或模范互助组带头，并以互助组为中心，逐步地做到以村屯为单位，开展了群众性的丰产竞赛运动。如吉林省蛟河县利用各种会议和各种方式，结合爱国主义教育，在农民中贯彻了丰产竞赛思想以后，便具体发动生产条件与组织基础都是一样的互助组，酝酿竞赛，以推动一般。至四月下旬，全县即有一千五百个互助组展开了竞赛。该省磐石县在发动马德江、马万祥、孙海等三组应战和挑战之后，接着便组织大批干部深入各互助组，展开时事宣传教育，鼓励群众生产热情，然后帮助互助组研究订计划，发动竞赛。据该县四月二十五日不完全统计，已有一千七百多个互助组卷入竞赛的热潮。
    目前，东北区的爱国丰产竞赛运动，虽在基础较好的地区和较好的互助组和村屯中已由广泛展开而渐趋深入，但大部地区还只是作了一般的号召没有把运动很好地开展起来。主要原因是有些农村干部对爱国丰产运动的认识模糊，更缺少办法。有的地区在发动几个模范互助组订计划、提出应战和挑战以后，就以为丰产运动展开了，而不去深入推动一般，因而使这一运动仍局限于少数模范互助组竞赛的范围内；甚至有些互助组在订丰产计划和提出竞赛条件时，不从实际出发，包罗万象，只单纯在形式上比条件多；或盲目发动比种的早、种的快，违反群众适时播种与种的好的要求等。上述偏向，东北区各级领导机关正注意纠正，以便使爱国丰产竞赛运动在全区广泛地开展起来。
