　　Wu Xun was a lackey of the landlord class
　　His promotion of education helped the reactionary rule
Editor:
　　Whether Wu Xun should be praised should depend on the role his actions—"begging for education"—played in the revolutionary movement of peasants resisting landlords at that time. Wu Xun blamed the cruel oppression of peasants by landlords at that time on the peasants' illiteracy. In other words, he did not call on the peasants to rise up and use arms to oppose the landlords, but rather called on the revolutionaries holding weapons and their descendants to lay down their weapons and enter the "free school" he ran to learn those "benevolence, righteousness, morality," "filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and trustworthiness," so that the resisters would never resist. It is very clear that the objective role of Wu Xun's "promotion of education" was to weaken the peasants' will to resist, split the revolutionary ranks, and directly serve the reactionary ruling class. Isn't this an important reason why the rulers built a memorial arch for him and bestowed a yellow jacket?
　　Can we, the Chinese people who have stood up, allow such a henchman of the rulers to be praised? The people will forever despise such a lackey of the feudal ruling class; whoever praises him separates himself from the people and speaks for the reactionary rulers. He not only insulted the Chinese working people, but also insulted himself!
　　People who praise Wu Xun! Bravely stand up and settle accounts with your own erroneous thoughts!

### 武训是地主阶级的奴才  他兴学帮助了反动统治

　　武训是地主阶级的奴才
    他兴学帮助了反动统治编辑同志：
    武训是不是应当被歌颂，应当看他的行动——“行乞兴学”——对当时农民反抗地主的革命运动所起的作用如何而定。武训把当时地主残酷的压迫农民，归罪于农民不识字。这也就是说，他不叫农民起来用武装反对地主，而是叫手拿武器的革命者们和他们的子孙放下武器，走进他所办的“义学”，学那些“仁义道德”，“孝悌忠信”，使反抗者永远不要反抗。很清楚，武训“兴学”在客观上起的作用，是削弱农民反抗的意志，分裂革命队伍，直接为反动统治阶级服务。难道这还不是统治者给他建牌坊、赐黄马褂的重要原因吗？
    这样一个统治者的帮凶，我们站起来的中国人民能允许他被歌颂吗？这样一个封建统治阶级的奴才，人民将永远唾弃他；那一个颂歌他，他就脱离了人民而为反动统治者说了话。他不但污辱了中国劳动人民，同时也污辱了自己！
    歌颂武训的人们！勇敢地站起来向自己的错误思想清算吧！
