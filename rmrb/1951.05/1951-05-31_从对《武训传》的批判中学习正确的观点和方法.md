　　Learning Correct Viewpoints and Methods from the Criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Chen Yiyu
    Usually, I would eloquently tell comrades: a Communist Party member should "firmly stand on the class stand." However, after watching the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," I was deceived by Wu Xun's "unparalleled spirit of self-sacrifice" of groveling and kneeling before others, and praised Wu Xun as a "hero." At the same time, I mistakenly believed that Wu Xun's rejection of the "benevolent gift" of the yellow riding jacket from the feudal rulers was a concrete manifestation of fighting against the ruling class at the time; Wu Xun's constant saying of "don't forget us poor children" meant he firmly stood on the "class stand." I failed to understand that the main class contradiction in feudal society was between the peasants and the feudal rulers. The only way to resolve this contradiction was through peasant revolution. Therefore, we should praise peasant revolutionary heroes who waged uncompromising struggles against the feudal rulers, rather than praising lackeys like Wu Xun who obsequiously surrendered to the feudal ruling class.
    In order to correct my above-mentioned wrong understanding, I am now conducting discussions on the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" with comrades in the office, and seriously criticizing my own wrong understanding of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" and Wu Xun.

　　从对《武训传》的批判中学习正确的观点和方法
    陈逸愚
    平时，我常滔滔不绝地向同志们说：一个共产党员应如何“站稳阶级立场”。但是，在我看了《武训传》电影以后，却被武训的那种摇尾乞怜、见人下跪的“无人能比的自我牺牲精神”迷惑了，歌颂武训是一个“英雄”。同时我还错误地认为：武训拒绝封建统治者“恩赐”的黄马褂，是与当时的统治阶级作斗争的具体表现；武训口口声声说“别忘了咱穷孩子”，是站稳了“阶级立场”。而没有了解到在封建社会里主要的阶级矛盾是农民与封建统治者之间的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的唯一方法就是农民革命。因此我们应该歌颂的是与封建统治者作不妥协斗争的农民革命英雄；而不是歌颂卑躬屈膝向封建统治阶级投降的武训一类的奴才。
    为了纠正我上述的错误认识，现在我正和机关内的同志们进行《武训传》电影的讨论，严肃地批判自己对电影《武训传》与武训的错误认识。
