　　Integrating Production Competition with Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    165 Ma Hengchang-Style Groups Emerge in Taiyuan
    By Our Special Correspondent Wu Xiang

    In the past six months, factories and mines in Taiyuan City have launched patriotic labor competitions, resulting in the emergence of 165 advanced production groups in the style of Ma Hengchang. From May 1st to 5th, representatives of these groups held a meeting to extensively exchange experiences and made a resolution to expand the movement to challenge the Ma Hengchang groups.
    All advanced groups were selected according to the conditions announced by the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in March. These groups can consistently ensure quality, increase output, improve technology, save raw materials, reduce costs, implement the production responsibility system, and consciously abide by labor discipline. In addition, a most important common feature is that these groups do a good job in political education. After this meeting, everyone more clearly understood that production must be integrated with the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Full political enthusiasm is a prerequisite for developing production. Therefore, each advanced production group is also a patriotic model group. Among these 165 advanced groups, some had a relatively good foundation. They learned from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group and, in the patriotic production movement to resist America and aid Korea, carried out patriotic ideological education in various ways. The workers' awareness improved, the whole group united as one, and rationalization proposals and technological improvements continued to emerge, significantly increasing both output and quality. There were also some groups whose work foundation was not good in the past. After challenging the Ma Hengchang group, they accepted the lesson that political education had not been thorough in the past and adopted methods of speaking out about suffering, recalling the past, and making comparisons. They closely integrated inspiring workers' patriotic enthusiasm to resist America and aid Korea with the labor competition, thus quickly transforming themselves into advanced groups. The Li Zhenji ore mining group of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was originally an ordinary production group with many shortcomings. In the patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea, the group launched a campaign to speak out about suffering, discussing questions such as "Who gave us the suffering in the past?", "Where does today's happiness come from?", and "Who are the volunteers shedding blood and sweat for?". The workers' awareness greatly improved, and they unanimously demanded to strengthen production to support the front. Everyone formulated a personal patriotic plan based on their past shortcomings, and finally, the whole group synthesized an "eight wants, six nots, and six guarantees" patriotic pact. As a result of implementing the patriotic pact, the production outlook of the group quickly changed. The workers' attendance rate increased from 84 percent in December last year to the current 98 percent. The production rate tripled. By separating ore lumps from fines, 15,000 jin of millet was saved in screening labor costs. The 28 members of the group actively took the lead in promoting more than 400 temporary workers in loading, unloading, sorting, and mineral processing, also launching a patriotic labor competition. Production efficiency increased, overcoming the past lazy phenomenon.
    Among the 165 advanced groups, the most outstanding is the Kang Xu group of the Taiyuan Machine Factory. This group not only specifically applied the experience of the Ma Hengchang group, but also developed the experience of the Ma Hengchang group. In the Kang Xu group, the three-guarantee system for protecting machinery, the noon-time technical research meeting, the first-piece product inspection system, the life review meeting, the setting of personal plans, the division of labor and cooperation assembly line operation system, and the labor discipline of ringing the bell to start work and washing hands on time have all become regular systems or consciously observed habits. More importantly, they now not only check the first piece of the finished product, but also implement a regular inspection system from the blueprint to the first piece of the finished product. Since July of last year, the whole group has completed its tasks ahead of schedule every month, and the quality has improved from 99 percent to no defective products in the last three months. Of course, these achievements are not only due to learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group, but also inseparable from the ideological education of patriotism in resisting America and aiding Korea. They run a small blackboard newspaper in their group, and often combine the specific work of the group with current affairs propaganda. At the beginning of the labor competition, the blackboard read: "Comrades, work harder and strive to complete the task as soon as possible; sweating on the production front is like throwing a bomb at the head of the American imperialists." When the labor insurance regulations were promulgated and the higher authorities decided to adjust wages, Kang Xu encouraged everyone: "Our lives are improving day by day, but we must not forget the people who are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves on the front lines." Their group also self-compiled, self-directed, and self-acted in two plays, "Raise Vigilance" and "A Happy Event for Workers," which were welcomed by all the workers in the factory. The Kang Xu group has in fact become the Ma Hengchang group of Taiyuan.
    The emergence of a large number of Ma Hengchang-style advanced groups proves that the patriotic labor competition in Taiyuan's factories and mines has been successful. But on the whole, the movement is not balanced enough. The development of some groups is wave-like and cannot continue to move forward. The main reason is that the leadership's ideological understanding of the importance of learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group is insufficient, and they do not yet understand that going deep into the groups is the key to leading the factory well. Some workers are not clear about the purpose of the competition and rely solely on temporary enthusiasm, increasing labor intensity, and production volume increases for a time, but it cannot be consolidated. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the resolution to expand the movement to challenge the Ma Hengchang group, vigorously disseminate and promote the experience of advanced groups, so that the vast number of employees will learn these experiences and boldly create, constantly enrich and develop these experiences. Make all the groups advance together around the advanced groups!

　　把生产竞赛与抗美援朝结合起来
    太原出现一百六十五个马恒昌式小组
    本报特约记者  吴象
    半年以来，太原市各厂矿开展爱国劳动竞赛，出现了一百六十五个马恒昌式的先进生产小组。五月一日到五日，这些小组的代表们开了个会，在会上广泛交流了经验，并作出扩大向马恒昌小组应战运动的决议。
    所有的先进小组，都是按中共太原市委三月份公布的条件评选出来的。这些小组都能做到经常保证质量、提高产量、改进技术、节省原料、减低成本、贯彻生产责任制、自觉遵守劳动纪律。此外，还有一个最重要的共同的特点，就是这些小组的政治教育做得好。经过这次会议，大家更明确了生产必须与抗美援朝运动结合起来。饱满的政治情绪，是发展生产的先决条件，因此，每个生产先进小组，同时又是爱国模范小组。这一百六十五个先进小组中，有一部分是基础比较好的。他们学习了马恒昌小组的经验，在抗美援朝爱国生产运动中，又通过各种方式，进行了爱国主义思想教育。工人觉悟提高了，全组团结一致，合理化建议与技术改进不断出现，产量、质量均显著提高。还有一部分小组，过去工作基础并不好，它们向马恒昌小组应战以后，接受了过去政治教育不深入的教训，采用诉苦、回忆、对比的方法，把启发工人抗美援朝的爱国热情，与劳动竞赛密切结合起来，因而也迅速变成了先进小组。太原钢铁厂李振基矿石小组，本来是一个普通的而且有不少缺点的生产小组。该组在抗美援朝爱国教育中，开展了诉苦运动，讨论了“过去的苦难是谁给的？”“今天的幸福是那里来的？”“志愿军流血流汗为了谁？”等问题，工人觉悟大大提高，一致要求加强生产，支援前线。每个人都针对各人过去的毛病，订出个人爱国计划，最后综合成全组“八要、六不、六保证”的爱国公约。贯彻执行爱国公约的结果，迅速改变了小组的生产面貌，工人出勤率由去年十二月的百分之八十四增加到现在的百分之九十八。生产率提高了三倍。由于把矿石块、末分开，节省了一万五千斤小米的筛工费。该组二十八人积极带头，推动了搬运、整理、选矿等四百多个临时工，也展开了爱国劳动竞赛，生产效率提高，克服了过去懒散的现象。
    一百六十五个先进小组中，最出色的要数太原机器厂的康绪小组。这个小组不但具体运用了马恒昌小组的经验，而且发展了马恒昌小组的经验。在康绪小组里，爱护机具三保制、中午技术研究会、首件成品检验制、生活检讨会、订个人计划、分工合作的流水作业制，及响铃开车、到点洗手的劳动纪律，都已经成为经常的制度或自觉遵守的习惯。更重要的，是他们现在已不单检查头一件成品，而且实行了从图纸到第一件成品的经常的检查制度。全组从去年七月以来，每个月都提前完成任务，质量由百分之九十九，提高到今年三个月没有出一件废品。当然，这些成绩的获得，不单由于学习了马恒昌小组的经验，和抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育也是分不开的。他们组里办着一块小黑板报，经常结合本组的具体工作进行时事宣传，劳动竞赛开始时，黑板上就写着：“同志们加油干，争取任务早日完；生产战线上出把汗，好比向美帝头上扔炸弹。”劳动保险条例公布和上级决定调整工资时，康绪就鼓动大家：“我们的生活在一天一天的改善，但我们不能忘记正在前线流血牺牲的人。”他们组又自编、自导、自演了《提高警觉》、《工人大喜事》两个剧本，受到全厂职工的欢迎。康绪小组事实上已经成为太原的马恒昌小组。
    大批马恒昌式先进小组的出现，证明太原各厂矿的爱国劳动竞赛是有成绩的。但整个说来：运动还不够平衡。有些小组的发展是波浪式的，不能持续前进。主要原因是领导思想上对学习马恒昌小组经验的重要性认识不足，还不了解深入小组是领导好工厂的关键。若干工人对竞赛的目的性不明确，单凭一时热情，增强劳动强度，生产量一度提高，但是不能巩固。因此，必须贯彻扩大向马恒昌小组应战运动的决议，大力传播、推广先进小组的经验，使广大职工，都来学习这些经验，并大胆创造，不断丰富和发展这些经验。使所有的小组都围绕在先进小组的周围共同前进！
