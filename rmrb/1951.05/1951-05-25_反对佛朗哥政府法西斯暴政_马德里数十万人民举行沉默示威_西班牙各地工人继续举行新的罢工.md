    Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, 23rd: The struggle of the Spanish people against the fascist Franco regime reached a new climax on the 22nd. On this day, in the Spanish capital Madrid, hundreds of thousands of citizens held an unprecedented, large-scale silent demonstration to protest the continuous rise in the cost of living. They were united in not taking streetcars, but walking to work, to express their anger. They also did not go to shops, cafes, or restaurants. Although these shops remained open as usual, no customers came. Telephone communication between Madrid and foreign countries was also cut off for a considerable period.

    Over the past two weeks, tens of thousands of anti-Franco leaflets have been secretly circulating in Madrid, calling on the people to hold this demonstration. The Franco government, terrified, specially convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures, and carried out large-scale arrests in Madrid, the Bay of Biscay, and the provinces of Catalonia and Gipuzkoa, using the threat of execution to intimidate the people. It concentrated the largest number of police and troops since the end of the civil war in Madrid to enforce martial law, attempting to suppress this scheduled demonstration by violence. From the evening of the 21st, the Franco government even dispatched armed mounted police to patrol the streets of the city all night. However, on the morning of the 22nd, the heroic people of Madrid resolutely walked to work in the face of the Franco military police's bayonets, letting the streetcars and buses run empty. The Franco government was completely helpless in the face of this. All its suppression measures completely failed.

    Now, the Spanish people's anti-Franco struggle is unfolding everywhere. Prior to this demonstration, workers in Álava province held a strike starting on May 5th. Subsequently, workers in Pamplona, Navarre, held a four-day general strike to protest rising living costs. The strike was met with armed suppression by Franco's police, and many strikers were shot and killed, but as a result, the scale of the strike expanded further. Many residents of the city participated in the funeral of the dead workers, and this funeral became a powerful mass demonstration. On the same day as the Madrid demonstration, a new strike broke out in Gipuzkoa province in northern Spain.

　　反对佛朗哥政府法西斯暴政
    马德里数十万人民举行沉默示威
    西班牙各地工人继续举行新的罢工
    【新华社二十三日讯】马德里讯：西班牙人民反抗法西斯佛朗哥政权的斗争在二十二日又达到新的高潮。这一天，就在西班牙首都马德里，数十万市民举行了前所未有的、规模极大的沉默示威，来抗议生活费用的不断上涨。他们齐心一致，不坐街车，步行上班，以此表示他们心中的愤怒。他们也不去商店、咖啡馆、饭馆。这些铺子虽然照常开业，却没有顾客上门。马德里通国外的电话也断绝了相当长的一个时间。
    过去两个星期以来，马德里就秘密流传着几万份反佛朗哥的传单，这些传单号召人民举行这次示威。被吓得胆战心惊的佛朗哥政府，为此特地召开了紧急会议商讨对策，并在马德里和比斯开湾，以及加泰罗尼亚、吉普斯柯亚等各省进行大逮捕，并以处死来恫吓人民。它在马德里集中了内战结束以来最大数量的警察和军队实行戒严，企图以暴力镇压来阻止这一预定的示威。二十一日晚间起，佛朗哥政府更出动了武装骑警在全市各街道彻夜巡逻。但是，二十二日一清早，英勇的马德里人民就在佛朗哥军警的枪刺面前，坚决地步行去上班，一任电车和公共汽车空着开来开去。佛朗哥政府对此竟束手无策。它的一切镇压措施，完全归于破产。
    现在，西班牙人民反佛朗哥的斗争正在到处展开。在这次示威以前，亚拉瓦省工人在五月五日起举行了罢工。接着那瓦拉省潘普罗那城的工人举行了四天的总罢工，抗议生活费用上涨。罢工受到了佛朗哥警察的武装镇压，罢工者多人被枪杀，但是结果却使罢工的规模更加扩大，该城许多居民都参加了死难工人的葬仪，这个葬仪成了强大的群众示威。在马德里示威的同一天，西班牙北部的吉普斯柯亚省发生了新的罢工。
