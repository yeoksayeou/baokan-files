    Eradicate the Ideological Poison of the "Wu Xun Spirit"
    Editor:
    I didn't really understand what kind of person Wu Xun was before, nor did I fully grasp his story. However, I had a very deep impression of Wu Xun. Around 1942, I was studying at Fudan University in Beibei, Sichuan. At that time, Professor Zhang Mosheng of the Chinese Department greatly admired Wu Xun and wrote a long "character description" of Wu Xun, which students eagerly circulated. I also regarded Wu Xun as a "saint."
    Why did I have this perception at the time? Mainly because I thought Wu Xun was a poor person, and his ability to run schools in that way was admirable. This was a manifestation of my lack of a clear class concept, simply believing that poor people were good without principle, without understanding the reactionary essence of the "Wu Xun Spirit" from the "effect" of his actions.
    I have participated in the revolution for more than three years, but my understanding of Wu Xun has not changed. A few days ago, I watched the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" with a feeling of admiration. After watching it, I felt very stifled and embarrassed, but I couldn't explain why. After I came back, I told my comrades that it was not good. I said, why did Wu Xun have to cry? I particularly disagreed with the scene where Wu Xun gathered money and knelt down in front of some "adults," begging with tears in his eyes. I criticized the film's director for not having a clear stance, although Wu Xun had indeed knelt down and begged these "adults," but we cannot handle it with objectivism. This shows that I still have not negated the character of Wu Xun, mistakenly regarding Wu Xun as a representative of the peasant class, only disagreeing with the filming techniques of the movie. My understanding of Wu Xun is still confused.
    After reading the articles criticizing Wu Xun, I realized that Wu Xun is not a person worth praising at all. After reading the People's Daily editorial, I further realized that the Wu Xun issue is a matter of ideological principle. I agree that this issue must be discussed in depth. At the same time, I also warn myself that I must strengthen my political study and strictly guard against being misled by reactionary ideas in thought and action.
        (Worker's Daily Shao Jialing) Editor:
    I strongly agree with the People's Daily's criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." "The Life of Wu Xun" was also shown in Taiyuan. When I watched "The Life of Wu Xun," I didn't want to continue watching after seeing half of it.
    During the "July 7th" Incident, I went deep into the countryside to do anti-Japanese salvation work. At that time, I went to a primary school to be a teacher, and also ran night school remedial classes, teaching salvation songs, drawing salvation cartoons, and doing anti-Japanese salvation propaganda work. The young men, primary school students, and farmers in the village were all very close to me and shared my aspirations. I once fantasized that with so many masses supporting the anti-Japanese salvation cause, organizing the salvation forces would not be a problem. Who knew that the reactionary ruling authorities warned me: "Don't mess around, be careful of your head!" My ideals could not be realized! Just imagine, under the dark rule of the late Qing Dynasty, if the free schools run by Wu Xun did not coincide with the interests of the ruling class, could he have continued to run them? This question is very obvious.
    Wu Xun often knelt down on his knees in front of the landlord gentry class, with a bitter face and tearful eyes. This is completely the appearance of a slave! When I saw Wu Xun kneeling to Yang, the local degree holder, kneeling to scholars, and kneeling to everyone who gave him a little money, I closed my eyes and couldn't watch anymore. Because this kind of cowardly, incompetent, begging, and humble character makes me feel very disgusted and hateful. What similarity does this have with the hardworking, brave, and tenacious struggle of the peasants against the ruling class? This is truly an intolerable insult to our nation.
    This film should be stopped immediately and should no longer be allowed to spread poisonous ideas to the people!

### 肃清“武训精神”的思想毒害

    肃清“武训精神”的思想毒害
    编辑同志：
    武训究竟是怎样一个人物，以前我是不十分了解的，也没十分弄清他的故事。可是我对武训的印象很深。早在一九四二年前后，我在四川北碚复旦大学读书。当时中文系的教授张默生非常崇拜武训，把武训写了很长一篇“人物描述”，同学们竞相传看。我也把武训当作“圣人”。
    当时我为什么有这种认识呢？主要是我认为武训是穷人，他能那样的办学校，精神很可佩。这是我缺乏明确的阶级观念的表现，只是无原则地认为穷人就好，没有从他行为的“效果”来认识“武训精神”的反动实质。
    参加革命三年多了，可是我对武训的认识没有变。前些日子，我抱着崇拜的心情看了《武训传》电影。看完后，觉得很气闷，很狼狈，但也说不出什么道理。我回来后就和同志们说不好，我说武训为什么要哭呢？我特别不同意武训凑好了钱，在几个什么“大人”面前跪下含泪哀求的场面。我曾批评电影的导演没立场，虽然事实上武训曾给这些“大人”跪下哀求过，但是我们不能用客观主义的手法来处理。这一点说明我仍然没有否定武训这个人物，错误地把武训看成是农民阶级的代表人物，只在电影的拍摄手法上不同意罢了。我对武训的认识依然是糊涂的。
    读了批评武训的文章后，我知道了武训根本不是一个值得歌颂的人。读了人民日报的社论后，使我进一步认识到武训这一问题是一个思想原则问题。我同意这一问题必须展开讨论。同时我也警惕自己，必须加强政治学习，在思想行动上要严防受反动思想的迷惑。
        （工人日报  邵嘉陵）编辑同志：
    我非常同意人民日报对《武训传》影片的批评。《武训传》在太原也放映过，我看《武训传》时，看一半就不想再看下去。
    “七、七”事变时，我曾深入农村去做抗日救亡工作。当时是到一个小学校里去当教员，还办了夜校补习班，教救亡歌曲，画救亡漫画，做抗日救亡的宣传工作。村里的年青小伙子、小学生和农民都和我非常亲近，意气相投。我曾幻想，有了这么多群众拥护抗日救亡，把救亡力量组织起来不成问题。谁知反动统治当局对我提出警告：“不准胡闹，当心脑袋！”我的理想无法实现！试想武训在满清末年的黑暗统治下，如果他所兴办的义学与统治阶级的利益不相吻合，他能办下去吗？这问题是很明显的。
    武训时常以双膝跪倒在地主豪绅阶级面前，面带苦容，两眼泪汪汪，这完全是奴才相！当我看到武训向杨举人跪，向秀才跪，向一切给他施点小钱的人都下跪时，我就闭着眼看不下去。因为这种懦弱、无能、乞怜、卑贱的性格，使我感到十分的嫌恶和痛恨，这与农民勤劳、勇敢与统治阶级作顽强斗争的性格有什么相同之处呢？这真是对我们民族的一种不能容忍的侮辱。
    这部影片是应当立即停演的，不能再继续让它对人民散布毒害的思想吧！
