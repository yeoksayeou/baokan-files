　　Commemorating "May First" International Labor Day
      Zhao Zhankui
    This year, we are welcoming "May First" in the high tide of resisting America, aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. As the leading class of the country, we Chinese workers, how should we commemorate our own festival in this high tide? I believe:

    First, we should popularize and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Every worker should conduct propaganda among the people around us, expose the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, eliminate the pro-American sentiments of some people, make everyone aware that American imperialism is our mortal enemy, establish the thought of hating American imperialism, strengthen the determination to defeat American imperialism, and recognize the great significance of our assistance to the Korean people. At the same time, resolutely support the declaration of the World Peace Council on the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. In addition to ourselves, we should also mobilize relatives, friends, and neighbors to actively sign this declaration. Furthermore, we must also denounce the crimes of Japanese imperialism in invading China and oppose American arming of Japan. In various forms, we must mobilize the people of the whole country to hate American imperialism and support the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    Second, consolidate and improve the patriotic production competition. Since February this year, under the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, workers across the country have launched a patriotic production competition to respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. This action is a concrete manifestation of our working class resisting America, aiding Korea, loving the motherland, and loving the people. In the past three months, in the Northwest Administrative Region alone, there have been six hundred production groups responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group. In the future, these groups should be consolidated and improved, and good experiences should be promoted in a timely manner. In the competition, every worker should use their brain, learn technology, unite with technical personnel, and improve production based on technological improvement. We must clearly recognize that only by increasing output and reducing costs can our lives be improved and the motherland become prosperous.

    Third, assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionary elements. To improve production and live in peace, we must eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the revolutionary camp. Otherwise, production will be sabotaged, and the people's democratic power cannot be consolidated. We resolutely support the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" and must raise vigilance, report counter-revolutionary elements, and hand them over to the people's government for legal action.

    Fourth, assist our peasant brothers in carrying out land reform. We must expel landlords and local bullies who have infiltrated cities and factories and hand them over to the local peasants for disposal. At the same time, we must be vigilant to prevent these counter-revolutionary elements from continuing to infiltrate factories.

    Fifth, implement the Labor Insurance Regulations. The Labor Insurance Regulations have been officially implemented since May 1st. This regulation is the victorious fruit of the thirty years of revolutionary struggle by our working class under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. In addition to sincerely thanking the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, every worker should implement the regulations with a responsible spirit.

    The above five points are what our working class should do well in commemorating this year's "May First" International Labor Day. I think that the enlightened brothers and sisters of workers across the country can, with our exemplary actions, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, in the attitude of masters of the country, work hard to produce, complete and exceed production plans; actively participate in various patriotic activities, unite other revolutionary classes, and strive to build our great motherland and make our motherland increasingly prosperous.

　　纪念“五一”国际劳动节
      赵占魁
    今年，我们在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的高潮中迎接“五一”节。作为国家领导阶级的我们中国工人，在这个高潮中，应当如何来纪念自己的节日呢？我认为：
    第一、应当普及深入抗美援朝运动。每个工友都应当向我们周围的人进行宣传，揭发美国帝国主义的侵略野心，清除某些人的崇美思想，使每个人都知道美国帝国主义是我们的死敌，树立仇恨美国帝国主义的思想，坚定打败美国帝国主义的决心，认清我们援助朝鲜人民的伟大意义。同时，坚决拥护世界和平理事会关于缔结中、苏、美、英、法五大国和平公约的宣言。除我们自己外，还应动员亲友邻人踊跃地在这个宣言上签名。此外，更要控诉日本帝国主义侵华的罪行，反对美国武装日本。以各种形式，动员全国人民仇恨美国帝国主义，支援朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军。
    第二、巩固提高爱国主义生产竞赛。从今年二月开始，在中华全国总工会号召下，全国工人都展开了向马恒昌小组应战的爱国主义生产大竞赛。这种举动，就是我们工人阶级抗美援朝和爱祖国、爱人民的具体表现。三个月以来，仅西北大行政区，向马恒昌小组应战的，就有六百个生产小组。今后应将这些小组加以巩固和提高，并将好的经验及时推广。在竞赛中，每个工友应打开脑筋，学习技术，团结技术人员，从改进技术的基础上提高生产。必须清楚地认识：只有提高产量，减低成本，我们的生活才能得到改善，祖国才能富强。
    第三、协助政府肃清反革命分子。我们要把生产搞好，要安心地生活，就必须肃清隐藏在革命阵营中的反革命分子。不这样，生产就会受到破坏，人民民主政权就不能巩固。我们坚决拥护“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，并要提高警惕，检举反革命分子，交人民政府法办。
    第四、协助农民兄弟进行土地改革。我们要把混入城市和工厂中的地主、恶霸分子驱逐出去，交给当地农民处理。同时要提高警惕，防止这些反革命分子继续混入工厂。
    第五、贯彻实施劳动保险条例。从五月一日开始，劳动保险条例就已正式实施。这个条例，是我们工人阶级在中国共产党领导下，经过三十年革命斗争所获得的胜利果实。我们除了衷心地感谢中国共产党，感谢中央人民政府，感谢毛主席，每个工友应以负责的精神，将条例贯彻实施。
    以上五条，就是我们工人阶级在纪念今年的“五一”国际劳动节应当做好的事情。我想，已经觉悟了的全国工人弟兄，都能以我们的模范行动，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，以国家主人翁的姿态，努力生产，完成并超过生产计划；积极参加各种爱国活动，团结其他革命阶层，为建设我们伟大的祖国，使我们的祖国日益富强而奋斗。
