　　Xinhua News Agency, Dusseldorf, 6th: According to Deutsche Presse-Agentur, the West German Central Committee Against Remilitarization has issued a declaration calling on the West German people to begin a referendum on the issue of opposing remilitarization and concluding a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

    The Central Committee announced that the call for a people's referendum has been endorsed by a broad spectrum of the German people, and pointed out that the Adenauer "government," fearing the expression of the people's will, has banned the holding of a people's referendum. This decision has no legal force because it blatantly violates the basic democratic right of citizens to express their opinions. Therefore, the Central Committee announces that the people's referendum must be held, and all attempts to prevent it are doomed to failure. The Central Committee emphasized: "The struggle to hold a people's referendum is the largest movement in western Germany in recent centuries."

    The Central Committee mentioned that during the Hitler era, German imperialists dragged the German people into World War II, causing them incalculable suffering and destruction, and now the remilitarization of Germany will bring another war and greater misfortune.

    The Central Committee pointed out that "this people's referendum is a decision concerning life and death," and called on everyone in West Germany to vote. The ballot only bears one sentence: "Do you oppose the remilitarization of Germany and support the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951?"

　　西德反对军国主义化中央委员会号召举行人民投票
    【新华社六日讯】据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫讯：西德人民反对重新军国主义化中央委员会顷发表宣言，号召西德人民开始就反对重新军国主义化问题和在一九五一年缔结对德和约问题举行投票。
    中央委员会宣布举行人民投票的呼吁已经得到德国广大阶层人民的赞同，并指出：阿登纳“政府”由于害怕人民意志的表现，禁止举行人民投票。这种决定是没有法律力量的，因为它公然侵犯公民表示意见的基本民主权利。因此，中央委员会宣布：人民投票一定要举行，所有阻止其举行的企图是注定要失败的。中央委员会强调：“争取举行人民投票的斗争是德国西部人民最近数世纪以来规模最广大的运动。”
    中央委员会提到：在希特勒时代，德国帝国主义者曾把德国人民拖入第二次世界大战，使他们遭受到无法估计的苦难和破坏，而现在德国的重新军国主义化又将带来另一次战争和更大的不幸。
    中央委员会指出“这次人民投票是有关生死问题的决定”，它号召西德每一个人都来投票，票上只印着一句话：“你反对德国重新军国主义化和赞成在一九五一年缔结对德和约吗？”
