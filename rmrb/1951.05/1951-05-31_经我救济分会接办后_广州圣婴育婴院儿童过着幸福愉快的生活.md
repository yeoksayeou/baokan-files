After the Guangzhou Sacred Infant Nursery was taken over by the Guangzhou branch of the China People's Relief Association, it has become a paradise for children, no longer a gloomy and terrifying den of devils. People passing by here can hear innocent laughter and the song "The East is Red" coming from the yard. Currently, the nursery has seventy-nine infants (some of whom were newly admitted after the takeover), with one doctor, one nurse, six nannies, and six assistants responsible for their care. The doctor and nurse check the infants' health daily and provide food according to the infants' different ages and physical conditions, establishing a nursing system. At the same time, a sick infant room was set up to isolate sick infants to prevent the spread of disease. Of the twenty-nine sick infants who were on the verge of death at the time of the takeover, nineteen have been rescued after careful diagnosis and treatment by the doctor. When children over the age of two in the nursery were first received, almost every one of them had one or more diseases. The older children, due to long-term suffering, had completely lost their innocent and lively childish nature. Now, except for four children suffering from serious chronic diseases who have been sent to the hospital for treatment, the rest of the children are gaining weight and their faces are becoming rosy day by day due to improved nutrition and a happy life. Two and three-year-old children have enough toys, all of which are gifts from people from all walks of life. The staff teaches the older children every day, teaching them to sing, dance, and read children's books. The older children have learned to do the Yangko dance and sing "The East is Red." In the past, they were forcibly isolated from the outside world by foreign nuns. Although they lived only a few miles from the city, they had never even seen a car. Now they are taken to various schools for visits, entertained for sightseeing, and watched movies. Many Young Pioneers from schools often write letters to express their concern for their lives and studies, encouraging them to make progress and love the motherland. They have clearly seen that the people's motherland is full of warmth and happiness, and is by no means the "hell of suffering" that foreign nuns have falsely claimed. The foreign nuns' poisonous plan to make them forget their motherland has been bankrupt because of their increasing awareness. Originally, the older children expressed their willingness to be Canadians, but now the children firmly and proudly answer people's questions by saying, "I am Chinese!" The children like the attire of the Young Pioneers very much. They often tie red scarves around their necks and ask the staff, "When can we join the team?"

　　经我救济分会接办后
    广州圣婴育婴院儿童过着幸福愉快的生活
    广州市圣婴育婴院经中国人民救济总会广州分会接办后已经成为儿童们的乐园，再不是阴森可怖的魔窟了。人们走过这里时，就可以听到从院里传出来的天真的欢笑和《东方红》歌声。现在该院有七十九个婴儿（其中一部分是接管后新收的），有一个医生、一个护士、六个褓姆、六个助理员负责护理他们。医生、护士每日检查婴儿健康情况，按婴儿不同的年龄体质分别供给饮食，建立了护理制度。同时又设立病婴室，隔离病婴，以防止疾病传染。接办时奄奄待毙的二十九名病婴，经过医生的悉心诊治以后，其中十九名已被挽救过来。该院二岁以上的孩子，刚接收过来时几乎每人都有一种以上的疾病，年纪稍大的更因长期受磨折完全失掉儿童的天真活泼的性格。现在除了有四个患着严重慢性病的被送到医院去治疗外，其余的孩子都因营养改善，生活愉快，脸庞一天天肥胖红润起来。二、三岁的孩子已有了足够的玩具，这些都是各界人民送来的慰问品。工作人员每天给大孩子上课，教他们唱歌跳舞和阅读儿童读物。大孩子们都已学会扭秧歌，会唱《东方红》。他们过去被外籍修女强制与外界隔绝，住在离市区不过几里路的地方，却连汽车也没有看到过。现在他们被带到各学校去参观，被招待去游览，看电影。许多学校的少年儿童队员常常写信向他们慰问，关怀他们的生活和学习，勉励他们进步和热爱祖国。他们已清楚地看见了人民的祖国充满了温暖和幸福，绝不是外籍修女们所胡说的“是受罪的地狱”。那些外籍修女们想使他们忘掉祖国的毒计，已因他们的认识日渐提高而破产了。原来较大的孩子们都表示愿意做加拿大人，现在孩子们都坚定而骄傲地答复人们的问话说：“我是中国人！”孩子们很喜欢少年儿童队员的装束，他们常常用红领巾系在自己的脖子上，问工作人员：“我们什么时候能够入队呢？”
