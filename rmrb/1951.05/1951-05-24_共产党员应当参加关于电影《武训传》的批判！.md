　　Communist Party Members Should Participate in the Criticism of the Film "The Life of Wu Xun"!
   Editor's Note: The self-criticisms of Comrades Dai Guangyi and Zhao Xin reflect that some Party members once blindly admired Wu Xun. Party organizations in various regions should, as required in the article "Communist Party Members Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun'" published in this newspaper on May 20, lead this ideological criticism work in an organized and planned manner.

　　共产党员应当参加关于电影《武训传》的批判！
   编者按：戴光毅、赵欣二同志的检讨，反映出了有些党员曾经盲目地崇拜过武训。各地党组织应当如本报五月二十日发表的《共产党员应当参加关于“武训传”的批判》一文中所要求的，有组织地有计划地来领导这一思想批判工作。
