　　Worker Injuries and Deaths Frequent in Huangshi City Factories and Mines: Local Leadership Should Pay Serious Attention
    In factories and mines in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, the rate of worker and staff injuries and deaths has increased due to the failure of leading cadres to prioritize safe production. The injury rate averaged over 80 people per month last year, and this year it has averaged over 180 people per month. In March of this year, the number of injured reached 286. The mortality rate has also increased compared to last year.
    Although a safety and health committee has been established in Huangshi City, it has not been effective and its work is passive, only addressing accidents after they occur, without researching effective ways to reduce accidents. Administrative and trade union bodies also do not adequately listen to the opinions of the masses. In January of this year, a certain iron and steel company in Central South China and Yuanhua Coal Mine launched a mass inspection, and workers put forward many suggestions on safety and health, but so far, neither the administration nor the trade union has studied them. Leading cadres lack safety education for workers. When accidents occur, they do not investigate the causes or educate everyone, but instead shift responsibility. In addition, the poor sanitary conditions in some factories and mines are also one of the reasons for the increased casualty rate. This is a serious phenomenon. This is a concrete manifestation of the lack of reliance on the working class to improve production. The Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and enterprise leaders should conduct a thorough inspection of the safety equipment of the city's factories and mines and quickly improve it.

　　Good Preparatory Work Results in a Bumper Spring Harvest in the Changlu Salt Area
    The Tanggu, Xinhe, Dagu, and Hangu salt fields in the Changlu Salt Area have all achieved bumper harvests this spring. The Tanggu and Xinhe fields alone produced 49.8% of the total annual task in just 50 days. The state-owned Dagu salt field exceeded its monthly target for April by 46%. State-owned and private salt fields in other areas such as Daqinghe, Hangu, and Huanghua also exceeded their monthly targets. The salt harvested in each field is large-grained and white in color.
    The reason for this year's bumper salt harvest, in addition to the favorable weather, is mainly due to the good preparatory work.

    黄石市各厂矿工人屡有伤亡当地领导机关应予严重注意
    湖北省黄石市各厂矿，由于领导干部不重视安全生产，工人、职员伤亡率增加。受伤率去年每月平均八十多人，今年每月平均一百八十多人，今年三月份受伤者竟达二百八十六人。死亡率亦较去年增加。
    黄石市虽已成立了安全卫生委员会，但没有发挥作用，工作被动，那里发生事故就到那里去，没有研究有效的办法减少事故。行政与工会听取群众意见也不够。中南某钢铁公司和源华煤矿今年一月份发动了一次群众检查，工人曾提出了很多关于安全卫生的建议，但到现在，行政上与工会都没有加以研究。领导干部对工人缺乏安全教育，发生了事故不研究原因与教育大家，反而推卸责任。另外，有些厂、矿卫生设备太差，也是造成伤亡率增加的原因之一。这现象是严重的。这是缺乏依靠工人阶级搞好生产思想的具体表现。中国共产党黄石市委员会、市总工会、企业领导方面应对该市各厂矿的安全设备进行一次深入检查，迅速予以改进。
            事先准备工作做得好  长芦盐区各滩今年春晒丰收
    长芦盐区塘沽、新河、大沽、汉沽等盐滩，今年春晒全获丰收。塘沽、新河滩区仅五十天内产盐就已完成全年任务百分之四十九点八。大沽公营盐滩，四月份超额完成全月任务百分之四十六。其他大清河、汉沽、黄骅等滩区公私营盐滩也是每月超额完成任务。各滩所收食盐粒大而色白。
    今年盐产丰收的原因，除气候较好外，主要是准备工作做得好。
