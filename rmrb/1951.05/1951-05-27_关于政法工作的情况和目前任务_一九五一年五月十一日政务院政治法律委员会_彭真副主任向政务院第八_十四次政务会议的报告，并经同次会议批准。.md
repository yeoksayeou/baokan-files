　　Regarding the Situation of Political and Legal Work and Current Tasks
    Report to the 84th Executive Meeting of the Government Administration Council by Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, on May 11, 1951, and Approved by the Same Meeting.

            (I) Brief Report on Several Major Tasks
    1. After the founding of the Central People's Government and the national victory, we immediately encountered a severe disaster caused by the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which affected almost the entire country. Approximately 120 million mu of farmland and 40 million people were affected. Because we had the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, relying on the efforts of governments at all levels and the people of the whole country, we quickly and completely overcame the disasters at that time and the continuous disasters in some areas thereafter, and gained rich experience. This experience is: First, the Central People's Government promptly formulated a nationwide and unified disaster relief plan, the main content of which was to transfer a large amount of grain to relieve the victims, and to carry out several engineering facilities in advance to provide work as relief, and to lead the people of the whole country to fight to overcome the disaster. Second, the principle of mass production for self-rescue was determined, combining relief with production. Of decisive significance was the launch of sideline production, the organization of material exchanges, and the rush planting of early-maturing crops; at the same time, extensive farmland water conservancy was carried out, and timely calls for frugality were made, combining disaster relief with disaster prevention, and enhancing the confidence of the disaster-stricken masses in overcoming the disaster. Third, social relief and mass mutual aid movements were launched, combining the relief movement of the broad masses in non-disaster areas and the mutual aid movement of the masses in disaster areas with the government's relief work. Fourth, disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and it must be grasped in time without delay.
    This spring, some provinces and regions, such as Jiangxi and Hunan, had too much rainfall and too low temperatures, while some provinces and regions, such as North China and Shandong, had too little rainfall. It is not yet certain whether this situation will cause difficulties. However, spring famine has already appeared in some areas, and it is necessary to urge cadres to lead the people to fully use existing experience to overcome the spring famine, and all localities must pay attention to doing a good job in disaster prevention work to overcome difficulties and strive for a good harvest this year.
    2. In the past year or so, we have made great achievements in terms of political power construction. We have successively formulated the organizational rules for people's governments at all levels and the organizational rules for people's representative conferences at all levels, and have gained some preliminary experience in urban and rural political power construction. Since the National Civil Affairs Conference last year, political power construction in various places has been further developed. As of now, the areas that have convened people's representative conferences or people's congresses nationwide include the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, twenty-five provinces, eight administrative regions, ten special districts, one hundred and twenty-nine cities under the jurisdiction of special districts or leagues, and one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one counties and sixty-five banners or administrative bureaus equivalent to counties; in addition, there are more than ten provinces and ethnic minority areas within counties that have successively implemented ethnic regional autonomy of varying scales, and established ethnic autonomous regional people's governments through people's representative conferences. The people's representative conferences of provinces and most cities have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress. Wherever people's representative conferences or people's congresses have been held, cadres and the people have gained some experience in using representative conferences. The common experience is that each meeting is better than the last. Wherever the meeting is well held, not only is the connection between the government and the people closer, but the broad masses of the people have begun to actively manage their own and national affairs by using the organizational form of representative conferences. The people generally reflect: "The people's government not only does things for us and reports accounts to us, but the government does what we decide. The people are really masters of their own affairs," "Who used to care about the demands of the people, and who dared to criticize the government? Now the government has made mistakes, and the people can also criticize it," "This is what is called the people's government." This has greatly increased the people's patriotic enthusiasm and sense of responsibility to the country. Cadres and the people have gradually understood the importance of the people's representative conference and its benefits.
    Experience has also proved that in cities with a population of more than 100,000, it is very necessary to convene district representative conferences. Through it, not only can the connection between the government and the people be strengthened and various municipal administration be promoted, but also the welfare work of local residents can be discussed in more detail, so that the people's representatives can effectively and concretely launch criticism of the staff, learn to manage national affairs, and effectively improve work.
    The current shortcomings are that the governments and cadres in some places still do not fully recognize that the people's representative conference and the people's congress are the basic system of the people's country and the basic organizational form of the people's political power; they have not convened people's representative conferences and government committees on schedule; in many places, "important work" has been "submitted to the people's representative conference for discussion and decision," but there are also some places where some proposals of the representatives have not been seriously dealt with; the style of cadres taking over and doing everything for the people still exists to a considerable extent. Therefore, the role of the people's representative conference has not been fully utilized, and the opinions of the masses have not been more comprehensively concentrated.
    3. From last autumn to now, more than 500 counties in the newly liberated areas across the country, covering areas with more than 130 million agricultural population, have carried out land reform, and approximately 80 million poor peasants have obtained approximately 10 million hectares of land. Together with the old liberated areas, land has now been distributed in areas with an agricultural population of 270 million, eliminating the feudal land system. This is a basic link in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. After the Central Government formulated the Land Reform Law and fundamental laws such as class delineation, under the leadership of the Greater Administrative Regions and the Provincial People's Governments, nearly 300,000 cadres were mobilized to participate in this movement. The methods adopted in various places were to first formulate plans, train cadres, conduct key experiments, and then advance steadily from points to areas. This is a guided, prepared, step-by-step, and orderly movement. This is a systematic, large-scale, and extremely fierce battle following the People's Liberation War. As a result of the completion of land reform, bandits were eliminated, and bandit leaders, habitual bandits, bullies, and special agents in the countryside were suppressed, and revolutionary order was consolidated; rural productivity immediately began to increase; the autocratic countryside became a democratic countryside, thus not only preparing reliable conditions for China's industrialization, but also laying a solid foundation for China's democratization. At the same time, experience has once again proved that it is impossible to quickly complete land reform and completely eliminate feudalism by relying on "peaceful land distribution." It is necessary to lead, let go, and fully mobilize the peasant masses, and confiscate and distribute land through mass struggle and by the masses themselves. Land reform must also be closely combined with resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing bandits, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and building people's democratic political power. It is also incorrect to carry out land reform in isolation. Only in this way can we widely and deeply mobilize the mass movement, smoothly complete land reform, and consolidate the achievements of the people's revolution; and only in this way can we thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all feudal remnants.
    4. Suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is another central link in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Since last summer, after it was discovered that some places had a tendency of "boundless leniency" in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements, the Central People's Government issued instructions to severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, convened various meetings successively, conducted in-depth inspections, specifically arranged the work on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and systematically conducted propaganda and education on strengthening public security, judicial work, and suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. Now, the bias of boundless leniency has generally been corrected. The work of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities has become a widespread mass movement of people from all walks of life on a national scale, and has become a kind of struggle against the enemy in which the People's Government is closely combined with the broad masses of the people. As a result of resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary elements: the people rejoiced and praised it, calling it "another emancipation," and no longer complained that the government "had no way to enforce the law"; the general cadres also believed that "all work is easier to do"; hundreds of thousands of armed bandits across the country have been wiped out, and the revolutionary order has been greatly consolidated, which not only effectively guaranteed the achievements of the people's revolution, but also guaranteed the smooth progress of production and construction.
    All experience proves that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is a continuation of the people's struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and is a fierce struggle waged by the people against the enemy to consolidate their own political power. This is not simply the work of the people's public security organs in anti-espionage and anti-espionage, nor is it simply the prosecution and trial work of the people's judicial organs. Therefore, it is not only necessary to have clear guiding principles and policies and legal weapons such as regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, but also requires: First, the close cooperation of all democratic parties and people's organizations, and the collective wisdom and efforts of the people's representative conferences and other meetings to carry it out; Second, fully mobilize the people from all walks of life, so that the work of public security and judicial organs in this regard is closely combined with the mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. But this does not mean that the masses can directly impose sanctions on counter-revolutionary elements without going through legal procedures, but that the government departments in charge should rely on the assistance and cooperation of the masses. Only by uniting the whole country, making a big splash, and wiping out all bandits, special agents, bullies, and other counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people in all directions can we quickly and thoroughly complete the task of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. In the current situation in our country, only in this way can we quickly consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic united front.
    Now we must continue to oppose complacency and underestimation of the enemy, continue to severely crack down on all hidden special agents and spies, and eliminate scattered bandits, bullies, and other various counter-revolutionary elements. This is a long-term and complex struggle that must be resolutely carried out. We must continue to resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities and oppose complacency and underestimation of the enemy, while at the same time strictly preventing any careless and hasty phenomena from occurring. Our general policy has always been to combine suppression with leniency, and our attitude must be to combine seriousness with caution. All counter-revolutionary elements who are between being killed and not being killed should not be killed, but should be dealt with by means of imprisonment and labor reform. These are the general instructions that Chairman Mao has repeatedly given us on this issue.
    5. In the past year or so, due to the vigorous organization of "people coming and going," effective and relatively systematic understanding, connection, and unity work has been carried out among ethnic groups; due to the great efforts made by all localities in military, political, economic, and cultural and educational aspects, and the ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic joint government system have begun to be promoted in ethnic minority areas and places where various ethnic groups live together, actively implementing the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government, therefore, many ethnic minority areas and places where various ethnic groups live together have fundamentally changed the bad ethnic relations caused by the reactionary rulers in the past, and have begun to establish new ethnic relations of friendship and unity. In the future, in addition to continuing to conduct understanding between ethnic groups, strengthening contact and unity work, we should also timely summarize and exchange the experience of various tasks, especially the experience of regional autonomy; at the same time, we should actively train ethnic minority cadres.
    6. In order to adapt to the development of the above-mentioned central tasks and ensure the needs of various other national constructions, in the past year or so, we have formulated and reviewed many important laws, regulations, rules, and regulations, and at the same time, we have also carried out preliminary reforms on the judicial system. At present, our country's laws are not yet very complete, but there are already some basic laws, regulations, and general rules, which have concentratedly embodied the will of the broad masses of the people and powerfully promoted the current struggles and construction movements of the people. In addition, preliminary achievements and experience have been gained in abolishing the old reactionary laws, clarifying the old legal views, and building the people's legislative and judicial views.

            (II) Several Issues in Work
    The mass movement to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, due to the correct leadership and unity of the Central People's Government and various democratic parties, has made great achievements. At present, this movement is continuing to develop and deepen in all aspects of the country. The political and legal work departments at all levels have gained some important experience from actual work. However, at present, some of our work still cannot keep up with the development of the mass movement, and there are still many shortcomings in work and many ideological problems that urgently need to be solved:
    1. At present, the phenomenon of neglecting political power construction still exists; therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the political and legal departments. "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power." The first thing in the revolution is to overthrow the reactionary political power, and then to build a new political power of the people on the ruins of the shattered old political power, lead the people to consolidate the victory of the revolution, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, so as to ensure the improvement and smooth development of the national and people's economic undertakings. However, to this day, some comrades still do not understand the great significance of the people's democratic dictatorship that Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us, and therefore neglect the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; neglect the criticism and elimination of the remaining old political style and old legal views; neglect the importance of convening people's representative conferences and government committees on schedule; neglect the cooperation between land reform and people's political power construction; neglect the great role of current political and legal work for the "lower foundation," that is, economic construction, and its close relationship; despise the work of political and legal departments, and are unwilling to do political and legal work, thinking that this work is dispensable. These views should be overcome, otherwise they will hinder the consolidation and development of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    2. Political and legal work is not a kind of work that only sits in the office to handle official affairs and engage in paperwork, but a kind of practical work that is widely combined with the mass movement. It is necessary to guide and closely contact the masses, promote work through the masses, and rely on the masses. Only by grasping the central link and combining the leadership with the masses can we complete the task well and thereby establish the department's regular work. This is the case with suppressing counter-revolutionary activities and the entire public security work, this is the case with political power construction and disaster relief and consolation work, and this is also the case with judicial, legal system work, and ethnic affairs work. We must never be confined to the internal affairs of the organs, entangled in the affairs of the organs, only see the office desk and not see the whole country, but should face the masses, face the whole country, grasp the central link, guide the movement, and promote the movement. Under the current circumstances, we should not overemphasize the detailed division of labor between departments, but should emphasize the close cooperation between various departments and within various departments around the central work task; within the political and legal departments, we should not overemphasize the central centralized leadership other than policy guidelines, but should emphasize simultaneously strengthening the unified leadership of local levels, that is, implementing "dual leadership" to benefit the work.
    In terms of legislation, at present, we should not rush to formulate some "complete" and "detailed" sets of regulations that are neither mature nor urgently needed, so as to close the door and build a car or bind the hands and feet of the masses; we should, according to the current central tasks and the problems that the people urgently need to solve, based on possibility and necessity, formalize mature experience, and gradually form systems and legal provisions from the notification of typical experience and the comprehensive experience of various places, gradually from simple to complex, from general rules to detailed rules, from single regulations to complete sets of criminal law and civil law.
    3. All our work cannot start from the viewpoint of reactionary "Six Codes" or the like, nor can it start dogmatically from some abstract theories, but must start from our current actual situation. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct investigation and research in a focused, systematic, and thorough manner, and to summarize work experience in a timely manner. Past experience fully shows that once attention is paid to investigation and research, typical experiences are collected and sorted out, the phenomena of "unclear tasks" and "not knowing where to start the work" will immediately begin to be overcome; the department's own work will also be quickly established and get on the right track, and the cadres will also be trained as a result, so the work enthusiasm will be quickly improved. Because the task of the political and legal departments is mainly about the concrete implementation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and it is necessary to guide the people's political struggle, it is necessary to constantly combine with business and strengthen the political education and policy education of cadres. This is of great significance for the improvement of the work of the political and legal departments.

            (III) Work Tasks for 1951
    Based on the current situation and tasks, in order to consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship, the work tasks for 1951 should be:
    1. Strengthen political power construction. People's governments at all levels across the country should convene people's representative conferences and government committees and administrative meetings in accordance with regulations. Except for county-level governments in areas where land reform has not been carried out and those with other special circumstances, they should create conditions as soon as possible to enable the people's representative conferences to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress within this year. All cities with a population of more than 100,000 should universally convene people's representative conferences in urban and suburban areas within the year. All rural areas that have completed land reform should convene village or township people's representative conferences to elect village or township people's governments. All localities should pay attention to the work of preferential treatment for revolutionary disabled soldiers and family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, and combine the state's preferential treatment and relief work with the mass preferential treatment and mutual aid movement.
    2. Continue to suppress counter-revolutionary activities. Severely suppress special agents, spies, and various counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people's cause; cooperate with the troops to thoroughly eliminate bandits and scattered bandits in various places; destroy the organizations of reactionary secret societies; universally complete the registration of members above the branch level of reactionary party groups; improve trial work, quickly transfer a large number of capable cadres, and adopt a blitzkrieg approach to clear backlog cases; effectively organize and expand labor reform work; improve prison administration; strengthen the people's public security forces, the people's police, and urban and rural people's public security organizations, and strengthen the security work of organs, borders, and economy.
    3. Prepare to complete land reform. Except for general ethnic minority areas, all newly liberated areas should prepare to basically complete land reform this winter and next year, and conduct necessary review in areas where land reform has been carried out, focusing on key areas.
    4. Regarding ethnic affairs, we should continue to strengthen contact work with various ethnic minority areas; continue to organize visits to ethnic minority areas in order to gain further understanding; we should assist business departments in developing health, trade, and cultural and educational work in ethnic minority areas in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner; especially important is to actively train ethnic minority cadres and actively promote the fundamental policies of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic joint government.
    5. Continue to formulate and review some basic regulations and laws according to necessary and possible conditions.
    6. In order to adapt to the current needs and ensure the completion of various work tasks, political and legal committees should be gradually established in people's governments above the provincial level (special offices and county people's governments can set up joint political and legal offices under the leadership of appropriate leaders when necessary and conditions permit), responsible for guiding and contacting the work of civil affairs, public security, judicial, procuratorial, court, and supervisory committees, and handling the organizational and work relations between them. The cadres of the political and legal departments should have the necessary supplements.
    Secondly, a large number of political and legal cadres should be trained. In addition to strengthening the training of public security and ethnic cadres, the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Greater Administrative Regions should train the main cadres of county and municipal administrative work and judicial work in stages and in rotation, and cultivate a group of teachers for the political and legal cadre training classes; assistance should be given to the curriculum reform of the political and legal departments of various universities. The Greater Administrative Regions and provinces should also begin to plan to train and cultivate a large number of political and legal work cadres at the county, city, and county-level and city-level levels.
    In addition, we should assist in establishing and strengthening people's procuratorial work and people's supervisory work at all levels around the central task, correct the unhealthy tendencies in various places at any time, and handle illegal and dereliction of duty incidents among cadres.

　　关于政法工作的情况和目前任务
    一九五一年五月十一日政务院政治法律委员会
    彭真副主任向政务院第八
    十四次政务会议的报告，并经同次会议批准。
            （一）几项主要工作简报
    一、中央人民政府成立和全国胜利后，一开始即遇到由美、蒋匪帮所造成的几乎普遍全国的严重灾荒，约有一亿二千万亩农田和四千万人口受灾。因为我们有伟大的毛主席为首的中央人民政府的领导，依靠各级政府各有关部门和全国人民的努力，迅速地完全战胜了当时及其后在若干地区连续发生的灾荒，并且取得了丰富的经验。这些经验就是：第一、中央人民政府及时制订了全国规模的、统一的救灾计划，其中主要的是一面调运大批粮食，救济灾民，一面提前进行若干工程设施，以工代赈，并领导全国人民为克服灾荒而斗争。第二、确定了群众生产自救的方针，使救济与生产相结合。其中有决定意义的是发动副业生产，组织物资交流，抢种早熟农作物；同时广泛兴修农田水利，及时号召节约，使救灾与防灾相结合，提高灾民群众克服灾荒的信心。第三、发动社会救济和群众互助运动，使非灾区广大群众的救济运动及灾区群众的互助运动与政府救济工作相结合。第四、救灾如救火，必须不失时机地抓紧进行。
    今春有些省区如江西、湖南等雨量太多，气温太低，而有些省区如华北及山东则雨量太少。这种情况是否会造成困难，目前尚不能肯定。但部分地区的春荒已经出现，须要督促干部领导人民充分运用已有的经验克服春荒，各地并须注意作好防灾工作，以克服困难，争取今年丰收。
    二、过去一年多，我们在政权建设方面，有很大成绩。先后制订了各级人民政府的组织通则和各级人民代表会议的组织通则，并取得了关于城市和乡村建政工作的一些初步经验。自去年全国民政会议以来，各地建政工作，已有进一步的开展，截至现在为止，全国已召开过人民代表会议或人民代表大会的地区，计有内蒙古自治区，二十五个省，八个行署区，十个专区，一百二十九个专辖或盟辖以上的城市，一千九百六十一个县及六十五个相当于县的旗或设治局；此外，还有十多个省、县以内的民族聚居地区，已先后实行了规模不同的民族区域自治，通过人民代表会议建立了民族自治区人民政府。省和多数市的人民代表会议，已代行了人民代表大会职权。凡是已经开过人民代表会议或人民代表大会的地方，干部和人民群众都已取得了运用代表会议的若干经验。共同的经验是：会议一次比一次开得好。凡是会议开好了的地方，不仅政府与人民联系密切了，广大人民群众已开始在运用代表会议的组织形式积极起来管理自己的和国家的事务。人民普遍反映：“人民政府不仅给我们办事，向我们报账，我们决定了，政府就办，人民真是当家作主了”，“从前谁管老百姓的要求，那个人敢批评政府？现在政府有了错，人民也可批评”，“这才叫人民政府”。这就大大提高了人民爱国的热忱和对于国家的责任心。干部和人民群众已逐渐了解人民代表会议的重要性和它的好处。
    经验又证明，在十万人口以上的城市中，区代表会议的召开，很有必要。通过它，不仅可以更加强政府与人民的联系，推进各项市政，并且可以更细致地讨论当地居民的福利工作，使人民代表切实而具体地展开对于工作人员的批评，学习管理国家的事务，有效地改进工作。
    现在的缺点是有些地方的政府和干部，仍然还没有充分认识人民代表会议和人民代表大会是人民国家的基本制度和人民政权的基本组织形式；还没有按期召开人民代表会议和政府委员会；有很多地方已把“重要工作”，“交人民代表会议讨论并作出决定”了，但也还有些地方，对于代表的若干提案，未予以认真的处理；干部包办代替的作风，还相当严重地存在着。因而尚未能充分地发挥人民代表会议的作用，更全面地集中群众的意见。
    三、去秋至现在，全国新解放地区，已有五百余县包括一亿三千余万农业人口的区域，进行了土地改革，约有八千万贫苦农民获得了约一千万公顷的土地。连同老解放区，现在已有了二亿七千万农业人口的地区分配了土地，消灭了封建的土地制度。这是巩固人民民主专政的一个基本环节。中央制订了土地改革法和划阶级等根本法令后，在大行政区和省人民政府的领导下，曾发动了将近三十万的干部参加这一运动。各地办法都是先制订计划，训练干部，重点试验，而后由点到面，稳步前进。这是有领导的、有准备的、有步骤的、并有秩序的运动。这是继人民解放战争后，一场系统的规模极大而又极激烈的战斗。土地改革完成的结果，土匪消灭了，乡村中的匪首、惯匪、恶霸和特务分子等受到镇压了，革命秩序巩固了；农村生产力立即开始提高；专制的农村变成了民主的农村，因此不仅为中国工业化准备了可靠的条件，并且为中国民主化奠定了巩固基础。同时经验又一次证明，要迅速完成土地改革，彻底消灭封建，靠“和平分田”是不可能的，必须有领导地、放手地、充分地发动农民群众，经过群众斗争，由群众自己动手来没收与分配土地。土地改革又必须密切地与抗美援朝、剿匪、镇压反革命及人民民主建政相结合，孤立地进行土地改革运动也是不对的。只有这样，才能广泛深入地发动群众运动，顺利完成土地改革并巩固人民革命胜利的成果；也只有这样，才能彻底、干净、全部消灭一切封建残余。
    四、镇压反革命活动，是巩固人民民主专政的另一个中心环节。自去夏发觉有些地方对于反革命分子的处理，有“宽大无边”的倾向以后，中央人民政府即颁发了严厉镇压反革命活动的指示，先后召集了各种会议，深入地进行了检查，具体地布置了关于镇压反革命的工作，并系统地进行了关于加强治安、司法工作及关于镇压反革命活动的宣传教育。现在宽大无边的偏向，一般已获得纠正，镇压反革命活动的工作，已成为全国规模的各阶层人民的广泛的群众运动，成为人民政府与广大群众密切相结合的一种对敌斗争。对于反革命分子坚决镇压的结果：人民欢声沸腾，交口赞扬，称之为“再一次翻身”，不再怨政府“有天无法”了；一般干部也认为“一切工作好做了”；全国百余万武装土匪已消灭殆尽，革命秩序已大为巩固，这不仅有效地保障了人民革命的成果，并且保障了生产建设的顺利进行。
    一切经验证明，镇压反革命活动的工作，是人民群众打倒美、蒋反动统治斗争的继续，是人民群众为巩固自己的政权而对敌进行的一种剧烈的斗争。这不是单纯的人民公安机关的反奸防谍工作，当然也不是单纯的人民司法机关的检察和审判工作。因此不仅要有明确的方针政策和惩治反革命条例等那样法律武器，而且需要：第一、各民主党派和人民团体的亲密合作，通过人民代表会议及其他会议群策群力地来进行；第二、充分动员各阶层人民群众，使公安、司法机关在这方面的工作与群众的镇压反革命运动密切相结合。但这不是说群众可以不经法定程序直接对反革命分子施行制裁，而是说政府主管部门应依靠群众的协助与合作，只有举国上下一致，大张旗鼓和四面八方地来肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他各种反革命分子，才能迅速彻底地完成镇压反革命活动的任务。在我国当前情况下，也只有这样，才能迅速地巩固人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线。
    现在必须继续反对麻痹轻敌思想，继续严厉打击一切隐藏的特务、间谍，肃清散匪、恶霸和其他各种反革命分子。这是长期的复杂的斗争，必须坚决进行。必须继续坚决镇压反革命活动并反对自满轻敌情绪，同时又必须严格防止任何粗枝大叶草率从事的现象发生。我们总的政策，始终是镇压与宽大相结合，我们的态度必须是严肃与谨慎相结合，一切介乎可杀可不杀之间的反革命分子都不要杀，而以处徒刑及劳动改造等方法处理他们，这些都是毛主席在这一问题上曾经反复给予我们的总的指示。
    五、一年多的民族事务，由于大力组织了“人来人往”，有效地进行了民族间比较系统的了解、联系和团结工作；由于各地在军事、政治、经济、文教各方面均作了极大的努力，并在各民族聚居地区及各民族杂居地方，开始推行着民族区域自治及民族民主联合政府制度，积极贯彻中央人民政府的民族政策，因此，有很多少数民族聚居和各民族杂居的地区，已根本改变了过去反动统治者所造成的恶劣的民族关系，开始建立起新的友爱团结的民族关系。今后除继续进行民族间的了解、加强联系和团结工作外，还应及时总结与交流各项工作的经验，特别是区域自治的经验；同时应积极培养少数民族干部。
    六、适应以上各项中心工作的开展与保障其他各种国家建设的需要，一年余来，我们制订与审查了不少的重要法规、条例、章则，同时对于司法制度，也已进行了初步改革。目前我们国家的法律，还不很完备，但已有了一些基本的法规、条例和通则，它们已集中地体现了广大人民的意志，并且有力地推动了人民群众当前的各种斗争和建设运动。此外，在废除旧的反动法律、澄清旧的法律观点与建设人民的立法司法观点上，均获得了初步成就和经验。
            （二）工作中的几个问题
    巩固人民民主专政的群众运动，由于中央人民政府和各民主党派的正确领导与团结一致，已有了很大成绩。目前这一运动正在全国各个方面继续开展和深入。各级政法工作部门，已从实际工作中，取得了一些重要经验。但目前我们的若干工作，还赶不上群众运动的发展，还有很多工作缺点和不少思想问题急待解决：
    一、目前对于政权建设忽视的现象，仍然存在；因此，政法部门工作有注意加强之必要。“革命的根本问题是政权问题”，革命首先是要打倒反动政权，接着就是在被粉碎的旧政权的废墟上，建设人民的新政权，领导人民巩固革命的胜利，巩固人民民主专政，以保障国家和人民经济事业的改进及其顺利的发展。但是，迄今还有些同志不了解毛主席所屡屡指示过我们的人民民主专政的重大意义，因而忽视镇压反革命工作；忽视对残存的、旧的政权作风及旧的法律观点的批判与清除；忽视定期召开人民代表会议和政府委员会的重要性；忽视土地改革与人民建政工作的配合；忽视目前政法工作对于“下层基础”即经济建设工作的巨大作用及其密切的关系；轻视政法部门工作，不愿作政法工作，认为这种工作可有可无。这些观点，应该加以克服，不然就会妨害人民民主专政的巩固和发展。
    二、政法工作不是一种只坐在屋子里办公事、搞文牍的工作，而是一种广泛与群众运动相结合的实际工作，要指导与密切联系群众、通过群众、依靠群众来推进工作。只有抓紧中心环节使领导与群众相结合，才能很好地完成任务并由此建立起部门的经常工作。镇压反革命活动和整个治安工作如此，政权建设和救灾抚恤工作如此，司法、法制工作和民族事务工作也如此。我们决不应该囿于机关内部，纠缠于机关事务，只看见办公棹子，而看不见全国，应该面向群众，面向全国，抓住中心环节，指导运动，推动运动。在目前情况下，我们尚不宜于过分强调部门间的精细分工，应该强调各个部门相互间，和各个部门内部，都围绕着中心工作任务而通力合作；在政法部门内，尚不宜于过分强调除政策方针以外的中央集中领导，应强调同时加强地方各级的统一领导，即实行“双重领导”以利工作。
    在立法方面，目前尚不宜于急求制定一些既不成熟又非急需的“完备”“细密”的成套的法规，以致闭门造车或束缚群众的手足；应该按照当前的中心任务和人民急需解决的问题，根据可能与必要，把成熟的经验定型化，由通报典型经验并综合各地经验逐渐形成制度和法律条文，逐步地由简而繁，由通则而细则，由单行法规而形成整套的刑法、民法。
    三、我们的一切工作既不能从反动的“六法全书”之类的观点出发，也不能教条主义地从一些抽象理论出发，必须从我们当前实际情况出发。因此必须有重点地并系统周密地进行调查研究和及时地总结工作经验。过去经验充分说明，一经注意调查研究，搜集了典型经验加以整理，则“任务不明”和“工作不知从何着手”的现象就立即开始克服；部门本身工作，也就能很快地建立起来，步入正轨，干部也就由此获得锻炼，因而工作情绪也就能迅速提高。因为政法部门的任务主要是关于人民民主专政的具体实施，要指导群众的政治斗争，所以必须不断地与业务结合，加强对干部的政治教育和政策教育。这对于政法部门工作的改进有重要的意义。
            （三）一九五一年的工作任务
    依据当前的形势与任务，为着巩固与发展人民民主专政，一九五一年的工作任务应当是：
    一、加强政权建设。全国各级人民政府应按规定召开人民代表会议及政府委员会与行政会议。除尚未进行土地改革地区的县以下政府及有其他特殊情形者外，均应尽速创造条件，于本年内使人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权。所有十万人口以上的城市，年内应普遍召开城区与郊区的人民代表会议。所有已完成土地改革的农村，应召开村或乡人民代表会议选举村或乡人民政府。各地应注意革命残废军人和烈、军、工属的优抚工作，并使国家的优抚和救济工作与广大群众的优抚互助运动相结合。
    二、继续镇压反革命活动。严厉镇压特务、间谍和各种危害人民事业的反革命分子；与部队配合彻底肃清各地股匪、散匪；摧毁反动会道门的组织；普遍完成关于反动党团区分部以上分子的登记工作；改进审判工作，迅速调集大批得力干部，采用突击方式清理积案；切实组织与扩大劳动改造工作；改进狱政；加强人民公安部队、人民警察和城乡人民公安组织，加强机关的、边防的及经济的保卫工作。
    三、准备完成土地改革。除一般少数民族地区外，所有新解放区，应准备于今冬和明年基本上完成土地改革，并于已进行土地改革地区，有重点地进行必要的复查。
    四、关于民族事务，应继续加强与各少数民族地区的联系工作；继续组织对少数民族地区的访问，以求得进一步地了解；应协助业务部门有计划有重点有步骤地发展少数民族地区的卫生、贸易和文教工作；尤其重要的是积极地培养民族干部，积极地推行民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府的根本政策。
    五、根据必要与可能的条件，继续制订与审查一些带基本性的条例和法规。
    六、为了适应目前的需要，保证各项工作任务的完成，应在省级以上人民政府逐步建立政治法律委员会（专署、县人民政府有必要又有条件时可在适当首长主持下设立政法联合办公室），负责指导与联系民政、公安、司法、检署、法院、监委等机关的工作，并处理相互间的组织与工作关系。政法部门的干部应有必要的补充。
    其次，应大批训练政法干部。除加强公安和民族干部的训练外，中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会与大行政区对于县、市政府行政工作与司法工作的主要干部，应分期逐步轮流加以训练，并为政法干部训练班培养一批师资；对各大学政法学系课程改革，应予以协助。各大行政区和省并应着手计划大批训练和培养县、市和县、市以下的政法工作干部。
    此外应围绕着中心任务协助建立与加强各级人民检察工作与人民监察工作，随时纠正各地工作中的不良倾向，并处理干部中的违法失职事件。
