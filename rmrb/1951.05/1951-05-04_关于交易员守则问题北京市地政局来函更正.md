    Regarding the Trader Codes of Conduct Issue, Beijing Land Administration Bureau Sends Letter Correcting

To the Editor:

    In the "Reader's Letters" column of April 24, the article "Beijing Real Estate Exchange Transforms Small 'Brokers' into Traders" mentioned five trader codes of conduct. These codes of conduct have been slightly modified by Mayor Peng Zhen. We hope you will correct them.

    Trader Codes of Conduct
    一、Actively serve the people, strictly prohibit soliciting fees, accepting bribes, receiving gifts, and any acts of using public office for private gain.
    二、Obey leadership, strictly abide by government policies and regulations, and shall not violate or neglect them.
    三、Work conscientiously and responsibly, and shall not concurrently engage in other occupations.
    四、Report illegal real estate broker transactions, and shall not condone or shield them.
    五、Be kind and sincere to citizens, actively reflect problems, and shall not deceive or conceal information.
                        Beijing Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau
