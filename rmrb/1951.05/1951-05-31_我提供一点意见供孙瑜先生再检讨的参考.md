　　I offer some suggestions for Mr. Sun Yu to review again for reference
Editor:
    After reading Mr. Sun Yu, the director of the film "The Life of Wu Xun,"'s "My Preliminary Understanding of the Mistakes I Made in 'The Life of Wu Xun'," I feel that this self-criticism is far from adequate. Here, I offer some suggestions for Mr. Sun Yu to review again for reference.
    As far as I know, the writing of the script and the actual production work of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" began as early as 1948. The production rights of this film initially belonged to the "China Film Studio" controlled by the Kuomintang reactionary government. Before and after the liberation, the "China Film Studio" sold the script and some of the filmed footage to Shanghai Kunlun Film Company, which continued the production. This is the origin of "The Life of Wu Xun" that was presented to the audience more than a year after liberation. Mr. Sun Yu also mentioned this in the preface to "The Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun" (edited by Li Shizhao, painted by Sun Zhijun, and printed by Shanghai Wanye Bookstore). It can be seen that "The Life of Wu Xun" had been revised somewhat after liberation: for example, the two segments at the beginning and end of the film where female cadres of the People's Government tell stories to the masses were added later. But, is this enough? Obviously, a film that was decided upon and had already begun shooting by a film studio belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government would never be a film that "typically embodies the noble qualities of diligence, bravery, and wisdom of our Chinese nation." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang would never approve of people who "struggle against the rulers for life." What is strange is, why does Mr. Sun Yu praise the figures beloved by the Chiang bandits without any consideration? Film, like other arts, is a weapon of class struggle in a class society, and it cannot be used everywhere just by putting on a "hat." After liberation, did Mr. Sun Yu consider what impact this film would have when it was screened in the new China after liberation? Who would it benefit, and who would it harm? Why continue to produce it? Mr. Sun Yu should conduct a deep self-criticism on this point.

### 我提供一点意见供孙瑜先生再检讨的参考

　　我提供一点意见供孙瑜先生再检讨的参考编辑同志：
    读了电影《武训传》编导者孙瑜先生《我对〈武训传〉所犯错误的初步认识》后，我觉得这个检讨是很不够的，在这里提一点意见，供孙瑜先生再检讨的参考。
    据我所知，《武训传》这部电影剧本的编写和实际摄制工作是在一九四八年就开始了的。这部电影的摄制权最初属于国民党反动政府所控制的“中国电影制片厂”。解放前后，“中国电影制片厂”将该片剧本和一部分摄制的片子卖给上海昆仑影片公司了，由其继续摄制。这就是解放后一年多拿来和观众见面的《武训传》的来历，孙瑜先生在《武训画传》（李士钊编、孙之俊绘，上海万叶书店印行）序文里也说到了这一点。可以看得出：解放后《武训传》曾经修改过了一些：如电影开场和结尾时人民政府女干部向群众讲故事的两段是后添上去的。但，这样就行了吗？很明显，一部曾经是蒋介石反动政府所属的电影制片厂决定和已经开始拍摄的影片决不会是“典型地表现了我们中华民族的勤劳、勇敢、智慧的崇高品质”的影片。蒋介石匪帮是决不会赞成“向统治者作一生一世斗争”的人的。奇怪的是，孙瑜先生为什么对蒋匪喜爱的人物，竟不加考虑地颂扬呢？电影，和其他艺术一样，在阶级社会里是阶级斗争的一种武器，决不是戴上一顶“帽子”就到处都能用的。解放之后，孙瑜先生是不是考虑过：这部片子在解放后的新中国放映会有什么影响？它对什么人有利，对什么人有害？为什么要继续摄制？孙瑜先生应该对这一点进行深刻的检讨。
