With the Huai River flood season approaching, more than ten steel factories in Shanghai, including Shanghai Steel Company, have completed production tasks such as steel casting, iron casting, and wrought iron before the 10th of this month. More than sixty machine factories, including Wusong and Universal, are working day and night on processing and assembly. According to the planned schedule, fifty sets were to be assembled before the 24th of this month, but based on the current production progress of various processing and assembly factories, it is likely that eighty sets will be completed around the 20th of this month. The quality of the products has also met the specified requirements. These achievements are mainly due to the creativity and high spirit of serving the people displayed by the workers and technicians participating in this project. For example, Zhu Xuezhang of the cleaning department and Li Dianjun of the electric cutting team of Daxin Machinery Factory collectively created a method of directly cutting hydraulic cylinders with high air pressure in one go, increasing work efficiency by more than three times and saving 700 pounds of oxygen per piece. The Second Manufacturing Plant of China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company and Dalong Machinery Factory have made significant achievements in improving tools and work methods. Wang Hu, a worker at the Second Manufacturing Plant of China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company, created a new tool called "adjustable circular arc plate," which made turning spheres ten times faster than before. The workers participating in the work quickly improved their work methods. Work that originally required 20 hours can now save six, seven, or even more than ten hours. Engineer Jin Yikang used a dividing head to make it possible to quickly and accurately machine internal circles that were previously difficult to machine. All twenty-five sets of connecting rods produced by the plant passed inspection. The heads and workers of the lathe, planer, boring, and fitter sections of Dalong Machinery Factory closely cooperated, frequently discussing work allocation and tool improvement issues. Therefore, although the drilling machine had problems and the blanks were received intermittently, the task was completed three days ahead of schedule. Universal Machinery Factory and Shanghai Railway Car Factory also made considerable achievements in improving tools.

Technicians and workers in various factories understood that the sluice project must be completed before the Huai River flood season in late June, so there could absolutely be no phenomenon of unqualified products being returned and reworked. In their work, technicians and workers were very cautious and meticulous. To avoid the phenomenon of dimensional mismatches between the parts manufactured by various processing factories, the technicians of Wusong Machinery Factory, which is responsible for assembly, specially made templates and distributed them to various processing factories for reference. In order to ensure the accuracy of the test pressure gauges, all assembly factories sent them to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Jiaotong University for verification before using them. Due to the high sense of responsibility of the technicians and workers, the dozens of sets of products that have been assembled all meet the specifications.

　　保证汛期前完成淮河水闸工程
    上海十余家钢铁厂作完浇铸机件 
    六十余家机器厂正努力加工装配
    淮河汛期将届，上海市上海钢铁公司等十余家钢铁厂在本月十日前先后提前完成了浇钢、铸铁、锻铁等生产任务。吴淞、通用等六十余家机器厂工人和技术人员们，正日以继夜地努力进行加工和装配工作。依照预定计划是在本月二十四日前装配好五十套，但以目前各加工和装配的工厂生产进度来看，本月二十日左右就可能完成八十套生产任务。产品的质量也都达到了规定的要求。这些成绩的获得主要是由于参加此项工程的工人和技术人员们发挥了创造能力和高度为人民服务的精神。如大鑫机器厂清理部门朱学章和电割小组李殿均等，集体创造了用高气压一次直割油压筒的方法，工作效率提高三倍余，每只并节省氧气七百磅。中国纺织机器制造公司第二制造厂、大隆机器厂在改进工具及工作法方面有显著成就。中国纺织机器制造公司第二制造厂工友王虎创造了新工具“活络圆孤板”，使车制圆球的时间比原先快了十倍。参加工作的工人们都迅速改进了工作法，原先需二十小时的工作，都能节省六、七小时甚至十多小时；金以康工程师利用了分度盘，使很难车制的内圆，能够工作迅速而准确。该厂所生产的二十五套连杆，经检验后全部合格。大隆机器厂车、刨、搪、钳各部分的主管和工友密切联系，经常讨论工作调配、工具改进问题，因此，虽然钻床有毛病、毛胚断断续续收到，终能提早三天完成任务。通用机器厂及上海制车厂，在改进工具方面也有相当成绩。
    各厂技术人员和工人明了水闸工程必需在六月底淮水汛期前完成，因而绝对不能发生出品不合格退货重做现象。在工作中，技术人员和工人都十分慎重细致。负责装配的吴淞机器厂技术人员们，为避免各加工厂制造成的零件发生尺寸不相符合的现象，特地做好样板发给各加工工厂做参考。各装配厂为使试验压力表准确，都先送至交通大学机械系校验后才使用。由于技术人员和工人们高度负责精神，已经装配好的数十套出品，都合乎规格。
