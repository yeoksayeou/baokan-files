Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 2nd: In the just war of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes and defending the nation, members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with their exemplary actions, have become role models for young soldiers and powerful assistants to the Chinese Communist Party organizations in the army. They play a significant role in marching, combat, and various tasks. In a certain battle, Youth League members He Xintian, Wang Xiqian, and Xu Shaocheng, despite being subjected to the enemy's fire from eight heavy machine guns, remained calm and fought bravely, encouraging other soldiers, and finally repelled the enemy and captured the hilltop. After the battle, He Xintian was honorably admitted into the Communist Party and promoted to deputy squad leader. In another battle, League member Xu Xiaoming defended his position alone, stubbornly resisting the enemy. When two trucks full of enemies rushed towards him, he blocked them head-on, destroying the enemy vehicles with two hand grenades and driving back the enemy. The role of Youth League members in combat can be seen from the following two statistics: Among the 2,603 League members in a certain unit, 895 have been credited with combat merits. At the commendation meeting of the fourth company of another unit, thirteen out of the twenty Youth League members in the company were selected as combat heroes.

Youth League members working in medical teams have demonstrated a high sense of responsibility in caring for the wounded. Female League member Wang Suqiu not only tried her best to care for the wounded, but also went to the mountains to chop firewood, fetch food, and wash clothes for them. In her spare time, she would tell the wounded about current affairs and teach them to sing. Among the twenty-two male and female Youth League members in a field hospital of a certain unit, eighteen were credited with merits.

Youth League members in various positions are striving to become Communist Party members through their own efforts. Among the twelve League members in the second company of a certain unit, five were approved to join the Communist Party on the front lines.

　　青年团员在志愿军中成为青年战士的榜样
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】中国人民志愿军中的中国新民主主义青年团员们，在抗美援朝、保家卫国的正义战争中，以自己的模范作用，成为青年战士们的榜样和部队中中国共产党组织的有力助手。他们在行军、作战以及各种工作中都起着重大的作用。某部青年团员何心田、王希谦、徐绍成在某次战斗中，虽然遭受敌人八挺重机枪火力的阻击，仍然沉着作战，并且鼓舞其他战士们，终于击退敌人，占领了山头。战后何心田被光荣地吸收为共产党员，并提升为副班长。在另一次战斗中，团员徐孝明一个人坚守阵地，顽强抗击敌人。当两辆满载敌人的卡车冲来时，他迎头拦住，用两枚手榴弹将敌人汽车击毁，打退了敌人。青年团员们在战斗中的作用，可以从下列两个统计数字中看出来：某部二千六百零三名团员中，已有八百九十五名团员立了战功。在另部第四连的评功会上，该连二十名青年团员就有十三人被选为战斗功臣。
    在医疗队中工作的青年团员们，在护理伤员中表现了高度的责任心。女团员王素秋不但尽力护理伤员，还给伤员们上山砍柴，打饭，洗衣服，空下来就给伤员们讲时事，教他们唱歌。某部一个战地医院里的二十二个男女青年团员中，就有十八人立了功。
    在各个不同岗位上的青年团员们都在以自己的努力，争取做一个共产党员。某部第二连十二名团员中，有五名在火线上被批准加入共产党。
