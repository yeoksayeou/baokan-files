　　State Bank Promotes Exchange of Native Products
　　Zheng Bobin
　　We are still a country where small-scale agriculture predominates, and farmers' livelihoods are closely related to production income. It is necessary to ensure the sale of a large quantity of native products in order to provide sufficient production funds for agricultural production; to increase the purchasing power of farmers and create favorable conditions for industrial production; to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and defeat imperialist blockades.
　　In the past year, the State Bank has devoted considerable effort to organizing and promoting the exchange of native products. First, it used a large amount of capital to support state-owned trade, thereby supporting the purchasing and sales efforts of state-owned trade organizations. As of the end of April, the funds loaned by the bank to state-owned trade institutions accounted for more than 80% of the total loans of the State Bank. Secondly, it supported supply and marketing cooperatives and cooperative freight yards. Last year, the State Bank provided supply and marketing cooperatives with 162.2 million jin of rice as long-term capital, and also lent more than 500 billion yuan as working capital, making supply and marketing cooperatives a powerful assistant to state-owned trade. In addition, the State Bank has also developed inter-port acceptance, purchase and sale loans, and various service businesses to support private merchants in transporting and selling native products. The acceptance loan method is one of the best ways for the bank to support material exchange and control the use of loans. In the past year, the State Bank has opened 431 acceptance points, forming a nationwide acceptance network, which closely connects producing areas, distribution centers, and sales markets. In areas where there are no acceptance conditions, some different flexible methods have also been created. This has played a great role in supporting private merchants in transporting and selling native products. Merchants reflected that "by listening to the bank and borrowing bank loans, they adjusted the market and made money." The bank's loans not only promoted the export of native products and the exchange for daily necessities in rural areas, but also narrowed the price difference between certain industrial and agricultural products. For example, the price of salt in Tongshan County, Hubei Province was 2,200 yuan per jin in May last year, but now it only costs 1,500 yuan. Tea only sold for 2,000 yuan per jin in May last year, but now it can sell for 2,700 yuan per jin. However, in order to further promote the exchange of native products, in the wider areas lacking acceptance conditions, it is still necessary to pay attention to many related organizational work, either directly encouraging private merchants to purchase and sell native products, or creating acceptance conditions. We know that in small and medium-sized cities, private merchant firms and peddlers still play a significant role in the exchange of native products. Local branch banking institutions should try to organize these forces. The Jiaozuo branch organized peddlers through small loans, lending 60 million yuan, and within a month, it purchased 3,500 jin of cowhide and 6,600 pieces of sheepskin. Chengdu organized 13 small pig bristle washing workshops, lending 300 million yuan, and collected more than 1,000 bundles of raw bristles, accounting for one-third of Chengdu's annual sales volume. These loans helped private merchants save manpower, reduce costs, facilitate transportation, accumulate capital, and expand operations.
　　In our country, which still lacks modern means of transportation, it is also very necessary to organize and utilize some relatively backward means of transportation. The State Bank can also play a role in promoting this. For example, in Chongqing, it promoted the organization of 43 joint venture cooperatives with 1,315 commercial vehicles, and provided them with planned loans, making transportation in the Southwest active. The Tianjin branch organized 500 to 600 wooden boats on the Ziya, Daqing, and Nanyun rivers, in groups of five or ten, and lent them money to help them repair and transport. The Hubei branch organized a sailing company at the Xiangfan River crossing. The Suiyuan branch also organized carts and camels, and gave them loans. In Jianyang County, Sichuan, the organization of a dozen transportation firms into the "Hequn" transportation firm also had great significance for facilitating the transportation of native products. In addition, some small-scale transporters and other private merchants can also be helped to organize. A joint venture cooperative of three transporters and other private merchants in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, obtained a loan of 60 million yuan to operate grain, reducing the cost by 12 yuan per jin compared to working alone.
　　In short, the State Bank has a significant role to play in promoting the exchange of native products. But we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We still need to constantly create various methods and vigorously promote this work.

　　国家银行促进了土产交流
    郑伯彬
    我们现在还是一个小农经济占优势的国家，农民的生活与生产收益很有关系。必须使大量土产获得销路，才能给农业生产准备充足的生产资金；提高农民的购买力，给工业生产创造有利条件；巩固工农联盟，击破帝国主义的封锁。
    过去一年来，国家银行曾以不少力量组织与促进土产交流。首先是以大量资金，支持国营贸易，从而支持国营贸易机关的收购和推销工作。截至四月底止，银行贷给国营贸易机构的资金，约占国家银行贷款总额百分之八十以上。其次是扶助供销合作社和合作货栈。在去年内，国家银行供给供销合作社一亿六千二百万斤米，作为长期资金，又贷给五千余亿元，作为周转资金。使供销合作社成为国营贸易的有力助手。此外，国家银行又开展了埠际押汇，购销贷款及各种服务性的业务，以扶助私商运销土产。押汇的贷款方式，是银行扶助物资交流，掌握贷款用途的最好方式之一。一年来，国家银行开办了押汇点四百三十一处，构成了全国性的押汇网，使产地、集散地，和销售市场紧密地连系了起来。在没有押汇条件的地方，也创造了一些不同的变通办法。这对于扶助私商运销土产，起了很大作用。商人反映说：“听了银行话，贷了银行款，调剂了市场还赚了钱”。银行的贷款，不但促进了土产出口，换回农村日用品，并且缩小了某些工农业产品的差价。如湖北通山县去年五月份食盐每斤价二千二百元，现在只要一千五百元，茶叶在去年五月份每斤只卖二千元，现在每斤已可卖到二千七百元。但是，为着更进一步的促进土产的交流，在更广大的缺乏押汇条件的地区，还必须注意许多有关的组织工作。或是直接鼓励私商购销土产，或是创造押汇的条件。我们知道在中小城市，私商行栈以及小贩，在土产交流中依然有很大的作用，各地分支银行机构应该设法把这些力量组织起来。焦作支行通过小额贷款组织小贩，贷给六千万元，在一个月之内，就收购了牛皮三千五百斤，羊皮六千六百张。成都组织了十三家猪鬃小洗房，贷款三亿元，收了生鬃一千多把，占成都全年销售量三分之一。这些放款，帮助私商节省了人力，减低了成本，便利了运输，积累了资金，扩大了经营。
    在我国还是缺乏近代交通工具的时候，把一些比较落后的运输工具加以组织运用，也是非常必要的。国家银行在这方面也同样可以发挥它许多推动的作用。例如在重庆推动组织了拥有商车一千三百一十五辆的四十三个联营社，予以有计划的贷款，使西南运输活跃起来。天津分行组织了子牙、大清、南运三条河流上的五六百条木船，以五条、十条为一组，贷款帮助他们修理和运输。湖北分行在襄樊河口组织了一个帆船公司。绥远分行把大车、骆驼也组织起来，给以贷款。四川简阳县把十几个运输行组织成“合群”运输行，对于便利土产运输也有很大意义。此外，有一些小规模的运输商，和其他私商，也可以设法帮助他们组织起来。山西榆次县三个运输商与其他私商的联营社，取得贷款六千万元，经营粮食，比单干每斤减低成本十二元。
    总之，国家银行对促进土产交流是具有重大作用的。但是我们不能满足于已获得的成绩，我们还需要不断地创造各种方式，大力把这一工作推动起来。
