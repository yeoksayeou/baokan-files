Puyang County Farm, Pingyuan Province
Promotes New Dryland Cotton Planting Method

    The state-run farm in Puyang County, Pingyuan Province, is now vigorously promoting a new drought-resistant cultivation method for cotton fields. According to the results of preliminary promotion last year, this new cultivation method has proven to be effective in increasing cotton yields in arid areas.

    The new dryland cotton planting method is as follows: First, use a plow with a moldboard to plow the cotton field back and forth four times, creating a furrow two plow-widths wide and two plow-depths deep, pushing the soil onto the ridges on both sides. Then, use a plow with the moldboard removed, or a three-pronged hoe, to plow one plow-depth deep or dig three to four inches deep in the middle of the furrow. In this way, the furrow depth can reach more than one foot. The distance between the furrows is determined according to the row spacing when planting cotton. Before sowing, spread fertilizer in the furrows and level the furrows and ridges with a harrow. When sowing, plant cotton seeds by dibbling or drilling in the deeply plowed furrows. After the cotton seedlings emerge, retain 1,000 seedlings per mu, or slightly more. When the cotton seedlings are large enough to be topped, use a plow to add soil between the ridges. This new cultivation method greatly enhances the drought and flood resistance of cotton seedlings. During the rainy season, because the deeply cultivated cotton fields have been earthed up, rainwater accumulates in the furrows after earthing up. Therefore, the cotton is not damaged by heavy rain and wet ground. This new cultivation method is now being promoted.

　　平原省濮县农场
    推广旱地植棉新耕作法
    平原省濮县公营农场现在正大力推广一种棉田抗旱的新耕作法。这种新耕作法，据去年初步推广的结果证明，确能提高干旱地区的棉田产量。
    旱地植棉的新耕作法是：先用带犁镜子的犁在棉田内来回犁四次，犁成两犁宽和两犁深的一条沟，把土分到两边背垅上；然后再用摘去犁镜子的犁或用三齿镢，在沟中间犁一犁深或刨三、四寸深，这样，沟深可达一尺以上。沟与沟的距离，按种棉时行与行的距离确定。下种前，把肥料撒在沟中，并将沟与背垅耙平。下种时，将棉籽点种或耧播在深耕的条沟上。等到棉苗出土后，每亩可留苗一千株或稍多一些。棉苗长到可以打杈时，再在背垅间用犁培土。这一新的耕作方法，大大增强了棉苗的抗旱抗涝力。雨季时，由于深耕的棉田进行了培土，雨水多积在培土后的沟内，因此，棉花也不因雨大地湿而受害。现在这一新的耕作方法正在推广。
