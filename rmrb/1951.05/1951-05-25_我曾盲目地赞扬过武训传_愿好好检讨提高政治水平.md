I Once Blindly Praised *The Life of Wu Xun*; Willing to Sincerely Self-Critique and Raise Political Level

Editor Comrades:

　　After initially watching the film *The Life of Wu Xun*, I felt it was a historical film with educational significance. I mistakenly believed that it depicted the struggle between peasants and landlords and bureaucrats. I was particularly impressed by Wu Xun's "hard work and simplicity" and "selfless devotion to the public." Therefore, I talked to everyone about how "good" Wu Xun was and how he was "worthy of our study."

　　Once, when I spoke of Wu Xun's willingness to crawl on the ground to be ridden on by rich children so that poor children could study, his willingness to be punched and kicked by the rich, someone suddenly said, "This kid has no backbone!" These simple and sharp words interrupted me like a bucket of cold water. At that time, I explained to him: "Wu Xun did that because the social situation at that time was different; we should not use today's situation to measure him."

　　It wasn't until after the People's Daily published the articles by Comrades Jia Ji and Yang Er that I suddenly realized that my previous views were completely wrong. I was not analyzing the problem from the perspective of the working people at that time. As a result, I became a volunteer propagandist for the class enemy and poisoned the people's minds. This is irresponsible propaganda to the people and detrimental to the revolution. In addition to examining my past mistakes, I am willing to improve my own political and theoretical level through the discussion of the film *The Life of Wu Xun*.

　　我曾盲目地赞扬过武训传
    愿好好检讨提高政治水平编辑同志：
    我初看了电影《武训传》后，感觉这是一部有教育意义的历史片。我错误地认为它描写了农民和地主、官僚的斗争。我对武训那种“艰苦朴素”、“舍己为众”的作风尤感钦佩。于是，我逢人便谈武训的为人“多么好”，“值得我们学习”。
    有一次，当我讲到武训为了使穷孩子能念书，不惜自己爬在地上让有钱的孩子骑着玩，不惜自己任富人拳打脚踢的情形时，突然有人说：“这小子真没骨头！”这几句简单而锐利的话，象一盆凉水打断了我的话头。我那时却向他解释：“武训之所以那样做，因为当时的社会情况不同；我们不应该拿今天的情况去衡量他。”
    一直到人民日报发表了贾霁、杨耳同志的文章后，我才恍然大悟，认识了以前的看法是完全错误的。我不是站在当时劳动人民一方面来分析问题，结果是替阶级敌人作了义务宣传员，毒害了人民的思想。这是对人民不负责任的宣传，对革命是不利的。我除了检讨我过去的错误外，并愿通过电影《武训传》的讨论，来提高我自己的政治水平和理论水平。
