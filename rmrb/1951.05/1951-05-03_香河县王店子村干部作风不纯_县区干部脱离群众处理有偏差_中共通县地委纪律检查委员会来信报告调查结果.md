　　Dishonest Work Style of Village Cadres in Wangdianzi Village, Xianghe County; County and District Cadres Detached from the Masses and Handled Matters with Bias
    Investigation Report from the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Tongxian District Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Letter from Li Shucheng
    Comrade Editor:
    The village cadres of Wangdianzi Village, First District, Xianghe County, Hebei Province, are corrupt and oppress the masses. The masses have reported them multiple times. The county and district governments not only delayed handling the matter but also rashly listened to the false accusations of individual village cadres, detaining the original complainants.
    Our village chief, Lu Yucheng, and Farmers' Association Director, Li Xirong, during the 1949 disaster relief period (when the Chaobai River flooded), mobilized the entire village to cut down trees and sell building materials, establishing a firewood cooperative. At that time, they mobilized more than 400 people, both men and women, young and old, to chop firewood. The collected firewood was worth about several hundred *shi* of corn (according to investigations, this number is exaggerated – editor). As a result, this firewood only exchanged for more than 600 *jin* of sorghum bran, 1,100 *jin* of wheat bran, two tons of coal dust, and 30 *jin* of kerosene.
    Since the opening of the firewood cooperative, Lu Yucheng, Li Xirong, Wang Yulu (Farmers' Association Deputy Director), and others, under the guise of being cooperative managers, frequently went to Beijing, living a lavish lifestyle. After the firewood cooperative collapsed, they did not give the masses an account of the finances, and the matter was left unresolved. Therefore, the masses suspected Lu Yucheng and others of corruption.
    In addition, they also have severely infringed upon human and property rights. More than 30 villagers have been beaten, detained, or fined by them. The fines totaled more than 2,300 *jin* of corn and 400 *jin* of wheat. The villagers are very dissatisfied with these matters. In February 1950, Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai from our village organized the masses to report to the district government several times. District Chief Qian Chenggui and District Party Secretary Wei Zhen and others delayed dealing with this. Later, Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai went to the Xianghe Court to sue. From early July to the end of August, they filed lawsuits four times, but the comrades in the court always told us to “go home and wait for news.” The last time, one comrade impatiently took our written complaint and said, “If you want to leave it here, leave it; if you don't want to, take it back.” In the end, nothing was done. We had no choice but to come to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the People's Daily in Beijing to appeal. After inquiries from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the People's Daily at each level, our District Chief Qian Chenggui and District Party Secretary Wei Zhen only came to our village on September 25th last year to resolve this matter. However, after they arrived, they did not conduct an in-depth investigation among the masses but instead listened one-sidedly to the false accusations of cadres Li Xirong, Wang Xing, and Li Zetian, saying that Zhao Xiang and Wang Decai had attempted to bribe Li Shuxuan and Wen Fubao with 30 *shi* of corn to assassinate Farmers' Association Director Li Xirong. After hearing this, Wei Zhen and others convened a village meeting and announced to everyone, “You are not qualified to report village cadres,” and prohibited the masses from investigating the cadres’ accounts. They also arrested Zhao Xiang, Wang Decai, Wen Fubao, and Li Shuxuan and sent them to the Xianghe Court for detention. Please, Comrade Editor, quickly forward this to the relevant authorities for investigation and handling.

　　香河县王店子村干部作风不纯  县区干部脱离群众处理有偏差
    中共通县地委纪律检查委员会来信报告调查结果
    李树成的来信编辑同志：
    河北省香河县一区王店子村村干部贪污、欺压群众。群众曾多次告发。县、区政府不但拖延不予处理，反而随便听信个别村干部的诬告，将原告扣压起来。
    我村村长卢玉成及农会主任李锡荣，在一九四九年救灾度荒期间（当时潮白河泛滥成灾），发动全村群众伐树、卖房料，成立木柴合作社。当时曾动员了男女老幼四百多人劈木柴，搜罗到的木柴约值数百石玉米（据调查此数有夸大——编者）。结果，这些木柴只换回了六百多斤高粱糠，一千一百斤麸子，两吨煤末和三十斤煤油。
    自木柴合作社开业后，卢玉成、李锡荣、王玉禄（农会副主任）等以合作社经理名义，经常去北京，吃穿都显得很阔气。木柴合作社垮台后，他们也未向群众们交待账目，不了了之。因此群众怀疑卢玉成等有贪污行为。
    另外他们还有严重地侵犯人权和财权的行为。村里先后被他们打、押或罚过的群众有三十多人，被罚的粮食有玉米二千三百余斤，小麦四百斤。对这些事情，村里群众很不满意。一九五○年二月，曾由本村赵祥、王德才二人组织群众数次到区政府告发。区长钱成贵和区委书记魏珍等对此拖延不理。后来赵祥、王德才二人又去香河法院起诉。从七月初至八月底，先后起诉四次，法院的同志也总是叫我们“回家听信”。最后一回，有一位同志很不耐烦地拿着我们的状纸说：“你们愿意放在这里就放在这里，不愿放就拿回去。”结果还是没管。我们只好来北京中央人民政府内务部及人民日报社申诉。经内务部及人民日报社逐级查询，我区区长钱成贵和区委书记魏珍才于去年九月二十五日到我们村来解决这件事。但他们来后，不在群众中进行深入调查，却片面地听信了干部李锡荣、王兴、李泽田等人的诬告，说赵祥、王德才二人曾企图用三十石玉米，收买李树宣、温福保二人去刺杀农会主任李锡荣。魏珍等听后即召开村民大会，向大家宣布说：“你们没资格告发村干部”，不许群众清查干部的账目；并将赵祥、王德才、温福保、李树宣等四人逮捕，送交香河法院羁押。请编辑同志速转有关机关调查处理。
