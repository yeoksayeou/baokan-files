　　Overcoming Drought, Completing Sowing Tasks
    Cotton Farmers Across the Country Intensively Combat Drought and Plant Cotton

    [This Newspaper Dispatch] Farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country are working hard to overcome drought and are intensively planting cotton. Since the beginning of spring this year, most cotton-producing areas have experienced insufficient rainfall and frequent dry winds, leading to drought. Currently, these regions have proposed completing cotton planting tasks even in the absence of rain, and are enthusiastically launching a drought-resistant planting campaign.

    In Hebei Province, a major cotton-producing area in North China, drought-resistant planting began in mid-April. As of May 4th, 65 percent of the province's cotton planting plan had been completed. Qiu County in Handan Prefecture had exceeded the original plan by 26,500 mu, and Daming County had exceeded the original plan by 9,000 mu. In Pingyuan Province, cotton planting had completed 80 percent of the planting plan, and in the Huxi Prefecture it had reached 90 percent. Shanxi Province had completed two-thirds of its planting plan, and some villages had exceeded their cotton planting plans. In Henan Province, the cotton planting plan was largely completed by the beginning of May. After rainfall in late April, cotton seedlings in Xuchang Prefecture had already emerged. Shandong Province had also completed 80 percent of its cotton planting plan, with Huimin Prefecture exceeding the plan by 180,000 mu.

    The above-mentioned cotton planting upsurges were launched in the struggle against drought. In order to complete the cotton planting plan, local people's governments have mobilized large numbers of cadres to go deep into the countryside to help farmers use the soil moisture retained from last winter's snow, utilize methods such as "grabbing moisture and drilling," and "carrying water to sow," to tenaciously carry out planting. Luo Yuchuan and Jia Xinzhai, vice chairmen of Pingyuan Province, personally led more than 600 cadres to various prefectures and counties to organize the masses to fight drought and plant cotton. Half of the cotton fields already sown in the province were planted by carrying water. Most of Hebei Province used "grabbing moisture and drilling." In areas where soil moisture was too poor, they carried out "carrying water to sow." Although there was rainfall in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and other places in April, the rainfall was too small and not widespread, and did not greatly help cotton planting. Grasping soil moisture conditions and sowing in a timely manner, or carrying water to sow, remains an urgent task for cotton-producing areas.

### 战胜干旱、完成播种任务  各地棉农紧张抗旱植棉

　　战胜干旱、完成播种任务
    各地棉农紧张抗旱植棉
    【本报讯】全国各产棉区农民，正努力克服干旱，紧张播种棉花。今年入春以来，大部产棉区因雨量不足，又多燥风，形成干旱。目前这些地区已提出在不下雨的情况下，也要完成植棉任务，热烈展开了抗旱播种运动。
    华北主要产棉区河北省四月中旬开始抗旱播种后，截至五月四日，已完成全省种棉计划的百分之六十五，邯郸专区的邱县已超过原计划二万六千五百亩，大名县超过原计划九千亩。平原省种棉已完成播种计划的百分之八十，湖西专区已达百分之九十。山西省已完成播种计划三分之二，有些村庄已超额完成种棉计划。河南省种棉计划五月初已大部完成，四月下旬降雨后，许昌专区棉苗已经出土。山东省也已完成该省植棉计划的百分之八十，其中惠民专区并超过计划十八万亩。
    上述各地的种棉热潮，是在和干旱的斗争中展开的。各地人民政府为了完成植棉计划，纷纷动员大批干部深入农村，帮助农民借耕地所存去年冬雪的湿度，利用抢墒耩种，担水点种等办法，顽强地进行播种。平原省罗玉川和贾心斋副主席亲自率领六百多干部到各专区、县组织群众抗旱种棉，该省已经下种的棉田，有一半是担水点种的。河北省大部分是抢墒耩种的，在耕地湿度太差的地方则进行担水点种。四月间河北、平原、山西等地虽曾降雨，但雨量太少，又不普遍，对种棉无大帮助，各产棉区掌握墒情（土壤湿度），趁墒播种，或担水点种，仍是目前紧急任务。
