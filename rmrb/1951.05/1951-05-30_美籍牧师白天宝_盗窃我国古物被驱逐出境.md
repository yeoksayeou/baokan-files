Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th. Daytime Paul, an American missionary of the Chengdu Christian Fellowship and former curator of the Antiquities Museum of West China University, who stole and damaged a large number of precious Chinese antiquities, was arrested by the Chengdu Military Control Commission in January of this year, interrogated, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison. Having served his sentence, he was deported by the Chengdu Military Control Commission on May 13.

During his tenure as curator of the Antiquities Museum of West China University from February 1949 to July 1950, the perpetrator colluded with Dai Qianhe (American), the previous curator who had returned to the United States, to smuggle various precious antiquities to the United States. These included painted pottery from the Neolithic Age unearthed in Gansu, exquisitely carved Qing Dynasty screen panels, ancient Qiang vases, panda skulls unique to Wenchuan, Qing Dynasty ancient tomb steles and meteorological charts, bronze furnaces, and embroidery. Dai Qianhe informed the perpetrator in a reply letter from the United States that "the antiquities shipped from China this time have been safely received without damage." The letter also requested that Daytime Paul continue to steal six Tibetan "Joyful Buddhas" hidden in the museum, as well as opaque quartz stones from the stone tombs on the summit of Kangding Tagong and pottery from the Neolithic Age unearthed in Gansu. In addition, Ge Weihan, the second former curator of the museum who had also returned to the United States, wrote a letter requesting that Daytime Paul steal a small brown-black double-eared water jar with a two-thousand-year history, unearthed on the Tibetan border, and all photographs of Sichuan Miao people, which were treasured by the museum. According to Daytime Paul's confession, he complied with all the requests mentioned in these letters.

According to the perpetrator's confession, he also successively damaged more than one hundred valuable Tibetan paintings (one-third of all the paintings in the museum's collection), fur-made Qiang hats, Tang Dynasty dancing figurines, Qing Dynasty Yongzheng porcelain bowls, and ancient plaques.

In July 1949, the perpetrator privately opened three boxes of antiquities that had been deposited in the museum by the Beijing Library in 1946, attempting to steal them. Last April, the Student Union of West China University learned of this matter and immediately reported it to the Public Security Department of the Chengdu Military Control Commission. After a detailed investigation by the relevant authorities, it was initially determined that the antiquities deposited by the Beijing Library were missing one Tang Dynasty single-eared water jar, one Ming Dynasty Konghua chicken coin, one Han Dynasty qin-playing clay figurine, one Han Dynasty small clay jar, and fifteen types of Tang and Han Dynasty Sichuan stele rubbings. Based on the above facts, the Chengdu Military Control Commission arrested Daytime Paul on January 9th of this year, sentenced him to four months in prison according to law, and deported him after the full term was served.

　　美籍牧师白天宝
    盗窃我国古物被驱逐出境
    【新华社成都二十八日电】盗窃和破坏我国大批珍贵古物的前华西大学古物博物馆馆长、成都市基督教友爱会美籍牧师白天宝，已经成都市军事管制委员会于今年一月间逮捕，并审讯属实，判处徒刑四个月，现在刑期已满，已为成都市军管会于五月十三日驱逐出境。
    该犯于一九四九年二月至一九五零年七月任华西大学古物博物馆馆长期间，与已返美之前任馆长戴谦和（美籍）相勾结，将馆中所藏甘肃出土之新石器时代的彩陶、清代精工雕花图屏、羌族古瓶、汶川特产熊猫头骨、清代古墓石碑和气象图表、铜炉、刺绣等珍贵古物多种偷运至美国。戴谦和从美国寄给该犯的复信中告诉他说：“此次由中国运来的古物已妥收无损”。信中并要白犯继续盗运藏在博物馆中的六个西藏“欢喜佛”和康定打箭炉山顶石冢上的不透明石英石和甘肃出土的新石器时代的陶器等珍贵古物。此外，该馆已返美之前第二任馆长葛维汉也曾来信要白犯为他盗运该馆珍藏着的西藏边境出土、具有二千年历史的棕黑色双耳小水盂和全部四川苗民照片。据白犯供称：他对这些信中所提到的事情均已照办。
    又据该犯供称：该犯并先后损毁名贵西藏画一百余幅（占该馆所有藏画的三分之一）、发制的羌人帽、唐代舞俑、清代雍正磁碗、古代匾额等珍贵文物。
    该犯又于一九四九年七月私将北京图书馆在一九四六年寄存该馆的古物三箱打开，企图偷窃。去年四月华西大学学生会得悉此事后，当即报告成都市军事管制委员会公安处，经过有关机关详密调查，初步查明北京图书馆寄存的古物已遗失了唐代独耳水盂一个，明朝空化鸡币一个，汉朝弹琴土俑一个，汉朝小土缶一个及唐、汉川碑拓片十五种。成都市军事管制委员会根据上述事实，于今年一月九日将白犯天宝逮捕，依法判他四个月徒刑，在执行满期以后，将他驱逐出境。
