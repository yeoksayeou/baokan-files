A Pioneering Undertaking to Turn a Harmful River into a Beneficial One
    —Introduction to the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation and Jiwei River Project

Since the People's Government began managing the Yellow River in 1947, the lower reaches of the Yellow River, which had been subject to dyke breaches and flooding for many years, have not experienced any serious flooding. Now, the People's Government has begun a great pioneering undertaking to turn the harmful river into a beneficial one, and is undertaking the Yellow (River) Diversion Irrigation and Ji (River) Wei (River) Project in Pingyuan Province. In this way, the Yellow River water will not only not harm the people, but will also be able to serve the people.

There are two main purposes for carrying out this project:

First, to divert Yellow River water to irrigate farmland in Xinxiang, Huojia, Yanjin, and Ji counties on the north bank of the Yellow River. The soil in this area is fertile and produces wheat and cotton, but what is lacking is water. After the completion of this project, the amount of Yellow River water diverted from the canals is estimated to be able to irrigate at least more than 360,000 mu of farmland, and may be increased to more than 400,000 mu in the future.

Second, after the diverted Yellow River water enters the Wei River near Xinxiang, it increases the water volume of the Wei River, which can facilitate Wei River navigation.

The Wei River flows into the Grand Canal in Linqing County, Hebei Province, and is an important waterway connecting Pingyuan Province to Tianjin. However, the Wei River has a small amount of water, and larger ships cannot reach Xinxiang when the water is dry every year. After the implementation of this project, the Wei River near Xinxiang can increase the flow rate by 20 cubic meters per second (that is, 20 cubic meters of water can flow in per second), and wooden boats with a load of around 100 tons can also reach Xinxiang when the water is dry. If the Wei River channel is dredged and reorganized, it will be no problem for steamships weighing 200 tons to navigate. This will greatly promote material exchange and develop production.

In addition, there are two benefits to carrying out this project: First, the saline-alkali land and sandy land in the Xinxiang and Ji counties area can be improved after being washed and silted by the Yellow River water. Second, there are four large waterfall projects on the canals diverting the Yellow River water, which can be used for hydropower generation.

The entire project is designed to open a canal (main canal) from the north bank of the Yellow River to the Wei River in Xinxiang, and then open three branch canals on the east and west sides of the main canal to irrigate farmland. A large-scale water diversion gate will be built at the head of the canal. The planned amount of water diverted from the Yellow River will not exceed 40 cubic meters per second at most. Because the time when the Wei River and farmland need water every year in spring and early summer is also the low water period of the Yellow River. Moreover, it is estimated that 40 cubic meters per second of water is sufficient to achieve the above-mentioned irrigation and Wei River benefiting purposes.

The three branch canals opened on the east and west sides of the main canal, the west branch canal irrigates farmland in Huojia and Xinxiang counties west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, irrigating approximately 140,000 mu of land; the east branch canal is divided into two lines, irrigating farmland in Xinxiang, Ji, and Yanjin counties east of the railway, one line can irrigate 86,000 mu of land, and the other line can irrigate 136,000 mu of land.

As early as 1949, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission proposed to carry out this project. After this plan was approved by the Central People's Government, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission specially established a Yellow River Diversion Irrigation and Jiwei River Project Office to start the design and preparation work for the project. In mid-March of this year, all preparations were completed, and construction of the water diversion gate at the head of the main canal was immediately started. According to the plan, the entire project can be completed by 1953. Next year, the main canal project can be completed, which can first achieve the purpose of benefiting the Wei River.

The Yellow River Conservancy Commission encountered many difficulties in designing this project, but as a result of repeated measurements and research by all the engineering personnel of the commission, they have been gradually resolved. For example: 1. Can water be introduced at the head of the canal? To solve this problem, it is necessary to accurately measure the lowest water level and normal water level of the Yellow River, as well as the slope of the area through which the canal passes. After accurate testing by the commission, it was proved that water could be introduced. However, if the river situation changes and the main stream moves, water may not be introduced. After the commission studied the hydrological data of the Yellow River for many years and investigated a section of the river bank near the head of the canal, it was proved that this section of the river bank is very solid. In the past, the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau threw more than 1 million cubic meters of stone on this section of the river bank to protect the railway bridge. At the same time, the river situation of this section of the Yellow River has not changed for 50 years, and the main stream often passes through the north bank. Therefore, it is determined that there will be no changes in the future. 2. Can the water diversion gate at the head of the canal be successfully built? The Yellow River here breached its banks during the Qing Dynasty, and the sand layer is very thick, so it may not be possible to build a stable water gate. After investigation and research by the commission, it was proved that the weight of the gate bottom, gate walls, etc. built with reinforced concrete does not exceed the load-bearing capacity of the sandy riverbed. If a retaining wall made of steel sheet piles is extended into the ground, the gate foundation will be even more consolidated. 3. How to deal with the sediment problem of the Yellow River water? After research by the commission, the water diversion time is the low water period of the Yellow River, and the sediment content of the Yellow River water is not large and easy to handle. Some people doubt whether the introduced water has the effect of silting and padding; later, after extensive investigation and calculation by the commission, it was proved that it can be silted and padded.

Now the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation and Jiwei River Project has started, and more than 3,000 migrant workers, many experts, technicians and cadres are working hard for this project. The Yellow River, which has been harmful for many years, is about to start serving the people. After the cotton and wheat producing areas around Xinxiang are irrigated by the Yellow River water, they will become more prosperous. The Wei River will become an important waterway for the import and export of materials in Pingyuan Province, and Xinxiang and other cities and surrounding rural areas will prosper as a result.

　　变害河为利河的创举
    —引黄灌溉济卫工程介绍
    自一九四七年人民政府治理黄河以来，历年决堤泛滥的黄河下游已经没有发生过严重的水灾。现在，人民政府又开始了一个变害河为利河的伟大创举，在平原省举办引黄（河）灌溉济卫（河）工程。这样，黄水不但不危害人民，而且能够为人民服务了。
    举办这一工程的主要目的有两个：
    第一、引黄水灌溉黄河北岸新乡、获嘉、延津、汲县等县的农田。这一带农田土质肥沃，产麦产棉，所缺的就是水。这一工程完成后，从渠道引出来的黄河水量，估计至少可以灌溉三十六万多亩农田，将来可能增加到四十多万亩。
    第二、引出的黄水在新乡附近归入卫河后，增加了卫河的水量，可以便利卫河航运。
    卫河在河北省临清县流入运河，是平原省通天津的重要航路。但卫河水小，每年水枯时较大的航船就到不了新乡。举办这一工程后，卫河在新乡附近可以增加二十秒公方的流量（即每秒钟可流入二十立方公尺的水量），载重一百吨上下的木船，水枯时也可到达新乡。如再将卫河河槽加以疏浚整理，就是航行二百吨重的汽船也无困难。这对于物资交流，发展生产有很大的作用。
    此外，举办这个工程还有两个好处：第一、新乡、汲县一带的碱地和沙地得到黄水的冲洗和淤灌后，土壤可以改良。第二、引出黄水的渠道上有四个大的跌水工程，可以利用水力发电。
    全部工程的设计是从黄河北岸开一渠道（总干渠）通至新乡的卫河，再在总干渠的东西两侧开干渠三条用以灌溉农田。渠首将建筑一座规模宏大的引水闸。计划从黄河引出的水量最多不超过四十秒公方。因为每年春季和夏初卫河和农田需水的时候，也正是黄河的低水期。而且估计要达成上述灌溉和济卫的目的，四十秒公方的水量就已够用。
    在总干渠东西两侧所开的三条干渠，西干渠灌溉京汉铁路以西获嘉、新乡等县的农田，约可灌田十四万亩；东干渠分两道，灌溉铁路以东新乡、汲县、延津等县的农田，一道可灌田八万六千亩，另一道可灌田十三万六千亩。
    早在一九四九年黄河水利委员会就提出要举办这一工程。这个计划经中央人民政府批准后，黄河水利委员会就专设了一个引黄灌溉济卫工程处，着手进行工程的设计筹备工作。今年三月中旬，一切筹备就绪，当即动工兴修总干渠渠首的引水闸。根据计划，全部工程到一九五三年可完成。明年总渠的工程可以完成，这就可以首先达成济卫的目的。
    黄河水利委员会在设计这一工程时，曾遇到许多困难，但经该会全体工程人员反复测量、研究的结果，都已逐步得到解决。例如：一、渠首能否引进水来？要解决这个问题，必须精确地测量黄河的最低水位和经常水位，以及渠道所经地区的坡度大小。该会精确测验之后，证明可以引进水来。但是，如果河势发生变化，主流移动，也会引不上水来。经过该会研究黄河多年来的水文资料，并调查了渠首附近一段河岸，证明这一段河岸非常巩固，当年京汉铁路局为了保护铁桥，曾在这一段河岸抛石一百多万公方。同时，这一段黄河的河势，已有五十年没有发生变化，北岸经常有主流经过。因此断定今后也不致发生什么变化。二、渠首引水闸能不能建筑成功呢？这里黄河在清朝时曾经决过口，沙层很厚，很可能不能建筑稳固的水闸。后经该会调查研究的结果，证明用钢筋混凝土建筑闸底、闸墙等，其重量并不超过河底沙质的承载效能。如果再用钢板桩作的围墙伸入地层下，闸基就更加巩固了。三、黄水的泥沙问题如何处理？经该会研究，引水时正是黄河的低水期，黄水的含沙量不大，易于处理。有人怀疑引进的水是否有淤垫的效能；后来经过该会多方面的调查和计算，证明是能够淤垫的。
    现在引黄灌溉济卫工程已经动工，三千多民工、许多专家、技术人员和干部正在为这工程努力。为害多年的黄河，即将开始服务于人民。新乡一带棉麦产区得到黄水灌溉以后，将更加富庶起来。卫河将成为平原省物资出入的重要航路，新乡等城市和周围的农村都将因此繁荣起来。
