　　Local Special Agents and Bandits Have Suffered Severe Blows
    Counter-Revolutionary Remnants are Carrying Out Retaliatory Sabotage Activities
    People in All Areas Should Heighten Vigilance and Strengthen Anti-Espionage and Elimination of Traitors

    [Report from this newspaper] In recent months, as a result of the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries in various regions, the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements has been severely hit, and general counter-revolutionary elements have begun to waver. Many reactionary party, league, bandit, and special agent elements who had previously shown hesitation or were deliberately waiting for an opportunity to act have voluntarily registered with the People's Government. Self-reformed elements have voluntarily reported their ideological situation to the People's Government, provided materials, and returned weapons and counter-revolutionary organizations. For example, counter-revolutionary elements under training in the eastern Sichuan area of Southwest China recently voluntarily handed over twelve heavy machine guns and more than two hundred rifles and pistols, and confessed new counter-revolutionary organizations. Some counter-revolutionary elements were so frightened and shaken that they ran out of options. Lin Zhenbang, a special agent lurking in Jianyang County, Fujian Province, was so afraid of being arrested by the People's Government that he ran to Fuzhou. Feeling that Fuzhou was not safe, he ran to Jian'ou. After seeing the special agent Li Chongqing executed in Jian'ou, he felt that he could not hide there either, so he surrendered to the Public Security Bureau, begging for leniency. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Kaifeng City, Henan Province, a special agent was so frightened that he ran from the city to the countryside and back to the city, asking his family to buy him a train ticket to escape. When asked where he wanted to go, he first said east, then west, and finally waved his hand and said: Buy it anywhere. When he arrived at the station with his ticket, the Public Security Bureau personnel were already waiting there and arrested him on the spot. Some counter-revolutionary elements with heinous crimes committed suicide out of fear of punishment.

    The organized bandits remaining in various regions have been basically eliminated. For example, the organized bandits in western Hunan, Guangxi, and Fujian, where bandits were most numerous in the past, have been wiped out, and the remaining bandits have surrendered their weapons. Li Yuting, a habitual bandit leader in Guangxi Province, recently led more than twenty bandits to surrender to the People's Government; after the Yongning People's Government executed the bandit leaders Li Bingheng and seven other criminals, the deputy captain of Li's bandits and his son led more than eighty bandits to surrender. According to statistics from a township in the Nanning Special District of Guangxi Province, within twenty-five days, 575 bandits surrendered themselves, handing over a total of 577 rifles and pistols.

    After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, rumors have decreased in various regions. Transportation arteries that were previously obstructed by counter-revolutionary armed harassment are now clear and unimpeded. All kinds of work are easier to do, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people has generally increased, and a new atmosphere has emerged in society. However, there are still a few unrepentant counter-revolutionary elements who are still carrying out retaliatory sabotage activities against the people through poisonous means such as poisoning, arson, and riots in a planned way. For example, the people in various parts of Yunnan Province have been severely harmed by counter-revolutionary elements. In the third district of Kaiyuan County, Yunnan Province, an entire village was poisoned; in another village, more than 140 people were poisoned, and more than 60 died from poisoning. In the first district of Mengzi County, Yunnan Province, eleven villages had their wells poisoned by counter-revolutionary elements. In the most serious case, in the village of Da Luogui, eight of the nine wells were poisoned, poisoning more than 600 people. In Yilong County, northern Sichuan, more than 3,000 people were poisoned. Similar incidents have occurred in government offices, troops, schools, and factories in Northeast, East, and South China. The remaining counter-revolutionary elements also assassinated the masses and working cadres. Feng Ziyun, a reactionary landlord in Tongren Township, Jiangbei County, eastern Sichuan, took advantage of a meeting of farmers' association cadres in a building to destroy the building's supports, causing the building to collapse, killing five people and injuring twenty-nine. Incidents of remaining counter-revolutionary elements assassinating our cadres and the masses have also occurred continuously in other regions.

    The remaining counter-revolutionary elements lurking in various regions are also systematically setting fires to sabotage factories, warehouses, cities, etc. Following the arson attack by counter-revolutionary elements in Lingling County, Hunan Province, a "Fire Brigade" belonging to the "China Anti-Communist Guerrilla Self-Defense Army" was uncovered in the Qiyang area. According to confessions, they conspired to set fire to Qiyang County on March 20. On March 18, a workshop and all the workers' dormitories upstairs in a factory in Qiqihar City, Northeast China, were destroyed by counter-revolutionary elements. On March 16, counter-revolutionary elements in Baocheng, Shaanxi Province, set fire to more than 200 civilian houses in the city. A military arsenal in a certain area of Yunnan Province was destroyed by counter-revolutionary elements, and the burning area was more than 1,000 meters long and 300 meters wide. Similar arson incidents have continued to occur in other regions, causing great losses to state and people's property. In addition, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements lurking in various regions are more frantically carrying out open armed riots. More than a dozen incidents of riots by counter-revolutionary elements have recently occurred in eastern and western Sichuan in Southwest China. Counter-revolutionary elements lurking in Renhe Township, Huayang County, western Sichuan, infiltrated the meeting place of our cadres, plotting to assassinate cadres and then launch an open riot, but were discovered in advance by us, and the conspiracy failed. On March 7, the reactionary feudal organization "Big Sword Society" in Linxia area, Northwest China, convened bandits led by the head of the society, plotting to attack Hanjiaji on the night of the 9th; and on the night of the 10th, attack the county seat, rob warehouses, attack prisons, and seize and release counter-revolutionary criminals. Counter-revolutionary elements lurking in Qinghai Province organized two "underground armies" in Guide, Hualong and other counties, plotting riots, but have been uncovered by us.

    The above-mentioned incidents of poisoning, arson, and riots by remaining counter-revolutionary elements in various regions are entirely carried out under the direct command of U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The U.S. and Chiang have constantly instructed the hidden counter-revolutionary elements to "use terror against terror" and "organized assassination, organized confrontation," attempting to save their dying fate. The People's Governments and the broad masses of people in various regions should heighten their vigilance, closely watch the enemy's conspiracies, resolutely implement the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, and immediately arrest and bring to justice those remaining counter-revolutionary elements who are carrying out retaliatory sabotage activities against the people, so as to avoid unnecessary losses to the state and the people.

　　各地特务土匪已遭到严重打击
    反革命残余正进行报复破坏活动
    各地人民应提高警惕加强防奸除奸工作
    【本报讯】近几个月来，各地大力镇压反革命的结果，反革命分子的气焰已遭到严重打击，一般的反革命分子已发生了动摇。很多过去表现犹豫观望或蓄意待机活动的反动党、团及土匪、特务分子主动向人民政府登记。自新分子自动向人民政府汇报其思想情况，反映材料，重新交出武器及反革命组织。如西南川东地区管训的反革命分子，最近又自动交出重机枪十二挺，长短枪二百多支，并供出新的反革命组织。有的反革命分子则吓得恐慌动摇，走头无路。福建省建阳县潜伏的特务分子林振邦，骇怕人民政府逮捕，跑到福州，感到福州不保险，又跑到建瓯。在建瓯看到特务李崇清被处决后，觉得那里也藏不住了，便到公安局自首，哀求对他宽大。河南省开封市镇压反革命以后，一个特务吓得从城里跑到乡下，从乡下又跑回城里，叫家里人给他买火车票，想向外逃。问他买到什么地方的车票时，他一会说往东，一会说往西，最后摆了摆手说：随便买吧。票买好了，当他走到车站的时候，公安局的人员早已等在那里，当场将他逮捕。还有一些罪大恶极的反革命分子则畏罪自杀。
    残留在各地成股的土匪已基本上肃清了。如过去土匪最多的湘西（湖南西部）、广西、福建等地成股土匪已被消灭，残匪亦纷纷交枪投降。广西省惯匪头子李玉廷，最近带领着二十多个土匪向人民政府投案；邕宁人民政府处决匪首李秉衡等七犯后，李匪之副队长及其儿子率领八十多个土匪来降。据广西省南宁专区一个乡的统计，在二十五天内，自新土匪达五百七十五人，共交出长短枪五百七十七支。
    经过镇压反革命以后，各地谣言减少。过去因反革命武装的袭扰而不能顺利通行的交通要道，现在已畅通无阻。各种工作好做了，广大人民的生产积极性普遍提高，社会出现了新的气象。但仍有少数死不改悔的反革命分子，还在有计划地以放毒、纵火、暴乱等恶毒手段，向人民进行报复破坏活动。例如云南省各地人民即已严重地受到反革命分子的毒害。该省开远县第三区有一个村全村群众中毒；另一个村有一百四十多人中毒，中毒致死者六十多人。该省蒙自县第一区有十一个村被反革命分子在井内下毒，其中最严重的大洛蘬村，九个水井，八个下毒，中毒者六百多人。川北区仪陇县全县共有三千多人中毒。类似事件，在东北、华东、华南等地的机关、部队、学校、工厂中均有发生。残余的反革命分子并暗杀群众及工作干部。川东江北县同仁乡反动地主封子云，趁该乡农民协会干部在一座楼房里集会时，破坏楼房的撑木，致楼房倒塌，砸死五人，砸伤二十九人。其它各地残余反革命分子暗杀我干部、群众的事件亦不断发生。
    暗藏在各地的反革命残余并有计划地纵火破坏工厂、仓库、城市等。湖南省继零陵县城遭反革命分子纵火破坏以后，在祁阳地区又破获了“中华反共游击自卫军”所属“放火大队”。据供，他们阴谋在三月二十日纵火焚烧祁阳县城。东北区齐齐哈尔市某厂，于三月十八日被反革命分子烧毁一个车间及楼上工人宿舍的全部。陕西省褒城的反革命分子于三月十六日纵火烧毁城内民房二百多间。云南省某地一个军火库被反革命分子烧毁，延烧地区长达一千多公尺，宽三百公尺。其它各地均连续发生类似纵火事件，使国家和人民财产遭受了很大损失。此外，各地潜伏的反革命残余更疯狂地进行公开的武装暴乱。西南川东、川西地区最近发生了十多起反革命分子暴乱事件。川西华阳县仁和乡暗藏的反革命分子，混入我干部会议的会场，阴谋杀害干部后公开暴乱，但事先为我发觉，阴谋未逞。西北区临夏一带的反动封建组织大刀会，于三月七日由该会头子召集匪徒，阴谋于九日夜晚袭击韩家集；十日夜进攻县城，抢仓库，打监狱，劫释反革命罪犯。青海省暗藏的反革命分子，在贵德、化隆等县组织了两个“地下军”，阴谋暴乱，但已被我破获。
    上述各地所发生的残余反革命分子放毒、纵火、暴乱等事件，完全是在美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮直接指挥下进行的。美蒋曾不断指示暗藏反革命分子“以恐怖对恐怖”、“有组织的暗杀，有组织的对抗”等，企图挽救其死亡的命运。各地人民政府和广大人民群众应高度地提高警惕，密切注视敌人的阴谋，坚决执行惩治反革命条例，对那些对人民实行报复破坏活动的反革命残余，应立即逮捕法办，以免国家和人民遭受不必要的损失。
