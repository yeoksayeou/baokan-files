　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The World Federation of Trade Unions Japan Liaison Bureau, on behalf of the Japanese working people, wrote a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, congratulating them on May Day. The letter stated that this year's May Day in Japan will be a day of struggle to strive for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and to oppose the rearmament of Japan. The full text of the letter is as follows: To Comrade Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Dear Comrades:
　　As we celebrate the May Day of 1951, we would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to you on behalf of the Japanese working people.
　　The workers of the world are celebrating this May Day amidst the frantic war preparations of the imperialists. The imperialists, supported by their regimes, are doing their utmost to use weapons and violence to destroy the unity of the workers, while their running dogs—international saboteurs—are shamelessly attempting to split the May Day celebration. However, the workers of the world will surely smash this conspiracy of the imperialists, and at the same time, the workers must show their united strength in front of the imperialists and their running dogs, and make this May Day a day of striving for peace, independence, and liberation.
　　In Japan, the heads of the Japanese General Federation of Trade Unions, colluding with the international trade union traitors, are disregarding the demands of worker unity and are attempting to split the May Day celebration, while they are trying to turn this workers' holiday into a day of compromising with war preparations.
　　However, the workers, including the members of the Japanese General Federation of Trade Unions, oppose this sinister attempt. The struggle to celebrate May Day in a unified manner is expanding day by day. The Unified May Day Celebration Council, which includes some individual organizations that have joined the Japanese General Federation of Trade Unions, is waging a tenacious struggle to make May Day a struggle to strive for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and to oppose the rearmament of Japan.
　　Chinese brothers and sisters who are launching a nationwide movement against the rearmament of Japan, Korean, Vietnamese, and other Asian brothers and sisters, Italian workers who are fighting against the Gasperi government's policy of destroying the country, North and South American brothers who are fighting against the brutal attacks of the international trade union traitors and imperialists! We Japanese workers salute your struggle and let you know that we clearly recognize our important responsibilities. Encouraged by the heroic struggles of the workers all over the world, the Japanese workers, with this understanding, have joined the members of the Japanese General Federation of Trade Unions in launching a struggle to strive for a unified celebration of May Day.
　　We will surely smash the saboteurs' conspiracy, win a unified celebration of May Day, and further advance the struggle for peace and independence and against war.
　　Smash the imperialists' war provocations and defend world peace!
　　Oppose a separate peace treaty that leads Japan to war and poverty!
　　Oppose the rearmament of Japan and West Germany!
　　All foreign troops withdraw from Korea!
　　Long live the united and unified May Day Labor Day under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　世界工联日本联络事务局致函我国总工会
    坚决表示要争取全面缔和反对重新武装
    【新华社二日讯】世界工会联合会日本连络事务局代表日本劳动人民写信给中华全国总工会，祝贺五一劳动节。信内表示要使今年五一劳动节在日本成为争取全面对日和约和反对重新武装日本而斗争的节日。来信全文如下：致中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一先生亲爱的同志：
    在庆祝一九五一年五一劳动节的时候，我们谨代表日本劳动人民向您们致以衷心的祝贺。
    全世界工人是在帝国主义者疯狂备战中，来庆祝这一个五一劳动节。在他们政权支持下的帝国主义者，竭力使用武器暴力企图破坏工人的统一，同时他们的走狗们——国际破坏者——正在无耻地企图分裂五一节的庆祝。然而全世界的工人必将粉碎帝国主义者的这个诡计，同时工人们必须将在帝国主义者和他们的走狗面前显示出他们的团结的力量，而使此五一节成为争取和平、独立与解放的日子。
    在日本，与工贼国际勾结的日本总同盟的首脑们竟不顾工人统一的要求，正在企图分裂五一节的庆祝，同时他们正想使这个工人的节日，转变成和他们妥协备战的日子。
    可是，工人们，包括日本总同盟的会员，反对这个罪恶的企图。争取统一地庆祝五一节的斗争，正在一天天地扩展着。统一庆祝五一节理事会，其中包括某些加入这个日本总同盟的个别组织，正为使五一节成为争取全面对日和约与反对重新武装日本进行着顽强的斗争。
    正在展开全国性的反对重新武装日本的运动的中国兄弟姊妹们，朝鲜、越南以及亚洲其他国家的兄弟姊妹们，正在进行着反对加斯贝利政府毁灭国家政策的斗争的意大利的工人们，正与工贼国际破坏者以及帝国主义者凶暴进攻作斗争的南北美洲兄弟们！我们日本工人们向你们的斗争致敬，并且使你了解我们清楚地认识到我们重大的责任。全世界工人英勇斗争鼓舞下的日本工人们，由于有了这个认识，就与这个日本总同盟的会员们，共同掀起了争取统一庆祝五一节的斗争。
    我们一定能粉碎破坏者的诡计赢得统一地庆祝五一节，并将争取和平与独立、反对战争的斗争更推进一步。
    粉碎帝国主义者的战争挑衅，保卫世界和平！
    反对使日本走向战争和贫困的单独媾和！
    反对重新武装日本和西德！
    一切外国军队撤出朝鲜！
    在世界工联旗帜下的团结统一的五一劳动节万岁！
              世界工联日本连络事务局金子健太
        一九五一年四月四日
