　　Compulsory Insurance Can Promote the Implementation of Economic Accounting System
     Pan Wenzhi

    Implementing the economic accounting system is a major event in China's financial and economic work in 1951. Insurance can promote the economic accounting system because it can compensate for accidental losses of enterprise property, ensure the accuracy of production costs, and enable enterprises to develop steadily.

    The economic accounting system originally aimed to promote and achieve the enterprise management of enterprises. It requires planned operation of enterprises based on the principles of self-sufficiency and elimination of waste, without having to rely on state budget subsidies. In order to implement the economic accounting system, it is necessary to register enterprise assets, clear warehouses, carry out anti-waste struggles, implement cost management, launch new production record movements, formulate new technical norms, adopt piece-rate wage systems, and establish production responsibility systems, etc., and cost management is undoubtedly one of the central links. Only with good cost management and accurate accounting can the self-sufficiency of enterprises have a basis, and then further improve management, improve technology, and strive to gradually improve production quotas and reduce production costs on the basis of mass production competition.

    Accidental disaster losses are often a major factor in disrupting cost accounting and production plans. Insurance is the simplest and most effective way to eliminate and compensate for losses. Therefore, conducting insurance is a necessary measure for implementing cost management and carrying out economic accounting. When implementing cost management, on the one hand, accurate calculation and management should be carried out for product quality, quantity, number of machines, technical standards, production personnel, working hours, raw material prices and their consumption, etc., and the enterprise's assets should be cleaned up, and its current assets and fixed assets should be clearly distinguished so that the government and enterprise authorities can understand its property situation. On the other hand, it is the effective protection of enterprise property. In order to prevent the occurrence of accidents and to make machinery and equipment durable, they should be checked and repaired diligently and in a timely manner, and necessary safety equipment should be installed. The expenses for this are also necessary production expenses. In order to cope with the natural consumption of fixed assets so that they can be replaced in a timely manner after reaching the end of their service life, depreciation should be accrued on a regular basis and reserved for the purchase of new products. Depreciation is also a necessary production cost, and failure to accrue depreciation will cause the cost accounting to lose an important basis. In order to overcome the damage caused by disasters and to quickly restore the accidental losses suffered by enterprise property, it is also very necessary to carry out insurance regularly to obtain protection. The expenditure of insurance premiums is also one of the necessary production costs, and costs that do not include insurance premiums are not the most accurate costs. Insurance is an indispensable link just like inspection, repair, safety equipment, disaster prevention and rescue, and depreciation. The expenditure on insurance premiums should not be a concern, just like the expenditure on other necessary production expenses. After enterprise property is insured, it only needs to pay a small proportion of insurance premiums at ordinary times. Once an accident occurs, the loss within the scope of insurance liability can be quickly compensated by the insurance company, so that the enterprise's funds will not be lost, the cost accounting will not be disrupted, and production can continue, and the planned plan can be completed. The New Democratic state-owned insurance business takes disaster prevention as its primary task and combines disaster prevention and insurance. After each unit is insured, it will receive full assistance and guidance in disaster prevention work, which will greatly help prevent the occurrence of disasters. Overall, insurance can turn the inestimable reserves of each unit for preventing accidental losses into fixed insurance premiums to be paid, thereby strengthening the implementation of the economic accounting system. Although the expenditure of insurance premiums increases the cost of production, it can exempt enterprises from the burden of inestimable reserves for accidental losses. Moreover, the proportion of insurance premiums in the cost is not large. People's insurance, especially compulsory insurance (insurance that the government stipulates must be implemented by law), has greatly reduced the premium rate due to the expansion of the insured area, "therefore, the impact of the so-called increase in costs will gradually decrease."

    In the past, China's insurance business has always been very backward, and it only began to grow and develop after liberation. Therefore, there are still many problems with everyone's understanding of insurance. Some people think that it is redundant to insure state property with state-owned insurance companies. They believe that the losses suffered by state property due to disasters are compensated by state-owned insurance companies, and the result is the same as direct appropriation from the government's finances, and both are borne by the state. Since this is the case, insurance is not necessary; insurance is more troublesome, and it is better to have direct appropriation from the finance department. Some people also feel that in order to solve the loss of accidental disasters, enterprises can set up reserve funds to restore the situation, and there is no need to pay a sum of insurance premiums to the insurance company to "make money" first. These two views are caused by a lack of understanding of the meaning of insurance. In fact, people's insurance is a kind of social mutual assistance in which insurance participants protect each other, and the insurance company organizes and handles it. Participants in insurance pay insurance premiums to the company according to the premium rates stipulated by the insurance company as a common insurance reserve fund. Among them, those who have an accident and suffer losses, the company will withdraw insurance money from the fund. There are often fewer people who have an accident, and the insurance premiums paid by most people who have not had an accident can play a role in helping those who have had an accident. That is to say, although the losses suffered by the victims are compensated by the insurance company, they are shared by all the insurance participants. The scope of this sharing can also be expanded to other insurance organizations through the business reinsurance (reinsurance) relationship between insurance companies, so that the sharing surface of losses is even broader. On the other hand, after the insurance premium is included in the production cost, it is finally reasonably borne by the consumer. Therefore, the nature of the losses suffered by state property and compensated by state-owned insurance companies is completely different from the burden of government appropriations.

    From the perspective of the insured units, participating in insurance can help themselves when necessary and also help other units. The role of the expenditure of insurance premiums should also be compared from the perspectives of both the unit and the overall interests. State-owned enterprises insuring with the state's insurance companies can not only strengthen the economic accounting of their own units, but also help the overall economic accounting, which is beneficial to themselves and contributes to the whole. Today's insurance company belongs to the people. The insurance fund it controls will be used by the state in a concentrated manner to develop production and construction, and its operating surplus will also be turned over to the government and owned by all the people.

    It is wrong to fundamentally ignore disasters and oppose insurance, and it is also wrong to only pay attention to disaster prevention and ignore insurance. The former lacks a sense of responsibility for protecting state property, while the latter cannot implement the purpose of protecting state property. Facts have proved that many disasters cannot be completely avoided. Taking fire as an example, although it tended to decrease in 1950 due to everyone's efforts to prevent fire, the extent of its damage was still very huge. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,580 fires occurred in major cities alone, and the property damage caused by larger disasters often amounted to tens of billions to hundreds of billions of yuan. Therefore, we must not ignore accidental disasters and harbor complacency and fluke mentality.

    The economic accounting system is to develop the national economy and realize the New Democratic production plan. We should cooperate with the implementation in various ways. The compulsory insurance for state property that is currently being implemented is precisely such a main way. It should be valued and actively promoted.

　　强制保险能推进经济核算制的实施
     潘文治
    实施经济核算制，是一九五一年我国财经工作中的一件大事。保险是能推进经济核算制的，因为它能补偿企业财产的意外损失，保证生产成本的准确，使企业经营能够巩固的发展。
    经济核算制原以促进并达成经营的企业化为主要目的，它要求根据自给生息、杜绝浪费的原则，有计划地经营企业，而无须求助于国家预算的补贴。为了贯彻经济核算制，应该登记企业的资材，清理仓库，进行反浪费斗争，实行成本管理，开展生产新纪录运动，制定新的技术定额，采用计件工资制，建立生产责任制等等，而成本管理一项，无疑是中心环节之一。惟有成本管理得好，核算得精确，才能使企业的自给生息具备基础，然后再进一步改进管理，提高技术，在群众生产竞赛的基础上，力求逐步提高生产定额，减低生产成本。
    意外灾害的损失，常常是破坏成本核算和生产计划的一个大因素。保险则是消除和弥补损失的一种最简便有效的办法。因此，进行保险是实行成本管理，贯彻经济核算的一个必要措施。实行成本管理时，一方面应该对于产品的质量、数量、机器台数、技术标准、生产人员、工时、原材料价格及其消耗等进行精确的计算和管理，并将企业的资材加以清理，划清其流动资产和固定资产，使政府和企业当局都能了解它的财产情况。另一方面，就是对企业财产的有效保护。为了防止意外事故的发生，并使机器设备能经久耐用，应该及时地勤快地检查和修理，装置必要的安全设备，为此支出的费用，也是必要的生产费用。为应付固定资产的自然消耗，使其在到达使用年限后，能及时去旧更新，按期提存折旧金，储备作为购置新产之用，也是必要的。折旧金也是一种必要的生产成本，不提折旧金就会使成本核算失掉了重要依据。为克服灾害的破坏，使企业财产所受的意外损失能迅速恢复，经常进行保险，取得保障，也是很必要的。保险费的支出也是必要的生产成本之一，不包括保险费在内的成本就不是最准确的成本。保险与检查、修理、安全设备、防灾施救、以及折旧等同样是不可缺少的一环，对保险费的支出，也与支出其他必要的生产费用一样，是不应有所顾虑的。企业财产经过保险以后，平时只须缴纳比例很小的保险费，一旦遇险，在保险责任范围内的损失，即可由保险公司迅速赔偿，使企业的资金不致赔折，成本核算不致破坏，而生产也得以继续，预定计划也得以完成。新民主主义的国营保险事业是以防灾为首要任务，是以防灾和保险结合进行的。各单位投保后，在防灾工作上将获得充分的协助和指导，大大有助于防止灾害的发生。总起来说，保险能把各单位防备意外损失的不易估量的准备金，化为固定的保险费来支出，因此，可以加强经济核算制的实施。支出保险费虽然增加了生产的成本，但可免除企业对不易估量的意外损失准备金的负担。而且保险费所占成本的比例并不算大。人民保险，尤其是强制保险（政府以法令规定必须实行的保险）的费率，已因承保面的扩大而大量减低，“因之所谓增加成本的影响也将逐渐减少”。
    过去中国的保险事业一向是很落后的，解放后才开始成长并发展起来。因此，大家对保险的认识还存在着很多问题。有些人认为以国家财产向国营保险公司进行保险，是一件多余的事。他们认为国家财产所受灾害的损失，由国营保险公司负责赔偿，与直接由政府财政上拨款弥补，结果都是一样由国家负担的。既然如此，就不一定要保险；保险要多一层麻烦，反不如由财政拨款直接简便。又有些人觉得为了解决意外灾害的损失，可由企业自提准备金设法恢复，不必先付一笔保险费给保险公司“赚钱”。这两种看法，都是由于不了解保险意义而产生的。其实，人民保险是参加保险者大家保障大家的一种社会互助，而由保险公司予以组织并处理。参加保险者按照保险公司规定的费率，缴纳保险费给公司，作为共同的保险准备基金，其中有出险遭遇损失者，公司就从基金中提付保险金。出险者常是较少的，多数未出险者所缴的保险费，就可发挥帮助出险者的作用。这就是说，出险者所受的损失虽是由保险公司经手偿付，却是由参加保险者全体分担的。这种分担的范围，还可通过各保险公司间业务分保（再保险）的关系，扩大到其他的保险组织方面去，这样损失的分担面就更为广大了。另一方面，保险费列入生产成本后，最后仍合理地归由消费者负担。所以国家财产所受灾害的损失，由国营的保险公司赔偿，与由政府拨款负担，性质是完全不同的。
    从投保单位来说，参加保险，能够在必要时帮助自己，又帮助其他单位。对于保险费的支出，也应从本位和整体两方面的利益来比较其作用。国营企业向国家的保险公司进行保险，不但能加强本单位的经济核算，而且也帮助了整体的经济核算，实是利在自己，功在全体。今日的保险公司是人民自己的，它所掌握的保险基金，平日将由国家集中运用，发展生产建设，它的营业盈余，也将上交政府，归全体人民所有。
    根本忽视灾害，反对保险，和只注意防灾，而忽略保险的态度，都是错误的。前者是对保护国家财产缺乏责任心，后者则不能贯彻保护国家财产的目的。事实证明，很多灾害是不可能完全避免的。以火灾为例，在一九五○年中，虽因大家努力防火而趋向减少了，但其破坏程度仍很巨大，根据不完全统计，只各主要城市就共发生了火灾一千五百八十余次，其中灾情较大的，损失财产常达数十亿至数百亿元。所以我们对意外灾害，决不能置之不顾和存在麻痹侥幸心理。
    经济核算制为发展国家经济，实现新民主主义生产计划，我们应以各种方式配合实施，现在所实行的对国家财产实行强制保险，正是这样一种主要的方式。是应该重视和积极推行的。
