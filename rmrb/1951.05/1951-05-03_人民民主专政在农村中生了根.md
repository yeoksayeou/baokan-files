　　The People's Democratic Dictatorship Takes Root in the Countryside
　　Professor of Philosophy Department, Peking University Hu Shihua
　　I followed the Beijing universities' East China Land Reform Visiting Group to visit land reform in southern Jiangsu. I left Beijing on February 8th and returned on March 9th, a total of one month. In terms of what I learned during this land reform experience, the gains were very significant. I have never learned so much in such a short period of time.
　　When I first arrived in Shanghai, I spoke with several friends, one of whom said: "The countryside is very chaotic now! Landlords are being hung up and beaten! Even during the struggle sessions, landlords are stripped naked in the freezing cold and forced to wear cold, wet clothes. There are even cases of landlords being force-fed cow dung." Therefore, he lamented, "The cadres are deviating! They're 'too left'!" Another friend said, "Land reform is fine, but why must there be struggle?" Because my own thinking was not clear enough, my explanations could not satisfy them. After I went to the countryside and returned to Shanghai, I was able to explain the issue to them more effectively. Because I understood that land reform must be a systematic and fierce struggle. The peasants' struggle emotions must be aroused, and the reactionary landlords must be resolutely suppressed!
　　Land reform itself is a revolutionary movement that shakes the earth, a major event to abolish the landlord class in society, and to thoroughly change the relations of production in Chinese society. Chairman Mao said long ago that it cannot and could not be "so refined, so leisurely and unhurried, so gentle and courteous, temperate, kind, respectful and modest" ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"), because land reform is "a violent action to overthrow the power of a class," "not like inviting people to dinner, or writing an essay, or painting, or embroidering" (same source).
　　People who have lived in the city for a long time only hear about landlords being beaten and landlords suffering. But we know too little about how the good, hardworking peasants suffered in the past! We cannot imagine how painfully our hardworking brothers and sisters in the countryside live, how they sweat, weep, and bleed! We cannot imagine how cruel the exploitation of the landlord class is! We cannot imagine how the landlord class is squeezing the marrow out of the peasants! We cannot imagine that the deep courtyards and mansions where landlords live, the rich meals they eat, and the elaborate clothes they wear are all transformations of the blood, flesh, and bones of the working people! In the past, personal interests prevented me from seeing this fact! Prevented me from correctly understanding this issue! When peasants poured out their grievances, they said: "The suffering the peasants endured at the hands of the landlords cannot be fully described in three days and three nights!" In fact, how can the suffering of the peasants be described in just three days and three nights! Feudal exploitation was truly too cruel. In the Zhenze district of Wujiang County, where we went, there were the so-called Xiao, Qiu, Gu, and Dong "four major families." Because of the cruel oppression of the peasants by these local bullies and landlords, the people gave them appropriate "nicknames," calling them: "Xiao the Skinner," "Qiu the Life-Taker," "Gu the Heart-Digger," and "Dong the Tendon-Puller." Gu the Heart-Digger once put a peasant's newborn baby on a tile, and slowly roasted the baby to death with charcoal fire underneath, to use as medicine to treat his tuberculosis. The tile used to roast the child is still preserved by the peasants who poured out their grievances, and there is a black mark on it! Another example is Chen Chunyuan, a great bully in Yangshe Town, Jiangyin County, who did all kinds of evil. I will now cite one of his cruel crimes: Five poor peasants in Northeast Village of Yangshe Town had not eaten for several days and were so hungry that they stole five dou of rice from his house. Chen Chunyuan captured the rice-stealing peasants, sharpened chopsticks, inserted them into their ears, and clapped his hands forcefully, killing them instantly! Naturally, these are relatively special examples, but they are not uncommon on a county or district level. As for the landlords' seizure, beating, extortion, and humiliation of the peasants, they are countless and endless. These became common phenomena and everyday occurrences in the countryside. During rent collection, peasants who could not pay their rent were hung up and beaten until their skin was torn and bleeding. Some big landlords even set up private prisons in their homes, locking up peasants who could not pay their rent, and many died in prison. Peasants who slightly offended the landlords were force-fed cow dung, hung up and beaten, stripped naked in winter and thrown into the river, their wives and daughters were raped, and their fields, livestock, and farming tools were seized everywhere. In some places, rent had to be paid in cash. Grain merchants who colluded with the landlords during rent collection lowered the price of grain, and then raised the price again after the rent was collected. The landlords used all kinds of methods to deceive and exploit the peasants, forcing them to pawn their land and sell their houses, sell their sons and daughters, become hired laborers, old maids, go to jail, hang themselves, or commit suicide... In every village we visited in our group, cases of cruel oppression and harm to peasants by local bullies and landlords were common and unremarkable. In the village of Xigang Township, when I talked to the old folks about the power of the landlords in the past, two peasants showed me the scars on their legs and backs from being beaten by the landlords! In the Zhenze district we visited, out of a total population of only 60,000, more than 1,800 people had been imprisoned for owing rent, 570 people had been forced to death by landlords, more than 400 had been beaten, and 35 had been beaten to death. And Zhenze district was not a place where feudal forces were particularly strong. When peasants poured out their grievances and struggled, they often cried when they talked about their past suffering, to the point of being speechless. Some choked up and could not speak when they got on stage, and some old people fainted on the spot. The peasants of Zhenze district had a folk song that fully expressed their suffering under the oppression of the landlords:

　　Peasants have two knives on their backs:
　　Heavy rent, high interest.
　　Peasants have three ways out:
　　Run away, go to jail, hang themselves.
And the landlords said: "You can't be rich without killing the poor!"
　　Our hardworking brothers lived an inhuman life under cruel feudal rule! The landlords exploited the peasants to the point of bone-deep hatred. Once they turned over, due to righteous indignation and accumulated blood feuds, some landlords were beaten at some struggle meetings, and individual landlords who had committed heinous crimes were beaten to death under the peasants' unrestrainable anger. Individual landlords were force-fed cow dung and suffered from the cold. In big cities, these were spread as news! Saying that the countryside was chaotic! But countless peasants were beaten, countless peasants were beaten to death, burned to death, hanged to death, killed, many peasants were force-fed cow dung, many peasants were thrown into the river... and no one talked about it. Landlords suffered a little "suffering" at struggle meetings, whose fault is it? Isn't the occurrence of this kind of thing due to the crimes committed by the landlord class themselves? Is it the fault of the peasants who painfully eked out a living under the landlords' tyranny in the past? Is it the fault of the hardworking peasants who were trampled on by the landlords and bled and groaned under their clubs? If you say that the peasants shouldn't, that the peasants were too harsh on the landlords, I think this is unfair! This is unreasonable!
　　It is also unfair to say that the cadres have deviated because individual landlords suffered a little suffering at struggle meetings. Let me give an example to illustrate. Our group went to a Tutang Township, and two bullies were to be struggled against the next day. These two bullies had committed several blood cases and did all kinds of evil in normal times, and the peasants hated them to the bone. Two peasants were discussing the day before, saying that they must beat these two bullies to death at the struggle meeting the next day, even if they had to pay for it with their own lives, they had to avenge their hatred. When the local working cadres found out, they immediately conducted persuasive education to these two peasants overnight, and implemented the policy thinking for them. They told them: Land reform is a major event for all peasants to turn over, not for narrowly avenging, and for the interests of all the peasants, you cannot beat them. The cadres patiently explained to them repeatedly, raising their class consciousness, and as a result, nothing happened at the struggle meeting the next day. The vast majority of cadres are wholeheartedly and selflessly contributing all their energy to the peasants' great cause of turning over. On the one hand, they deeply understand the peasants' demands; on the other hand, they are trying their best to grasp the policies and instructions of the higher authorities, so that this surging land reform movement does not overflow the scope of the policies. They use all kinds of methods to conduct persuasive education to the peasants. If a cadre persuades nine out of ten people, and one person is missed, or not persuaded, and a little trouble occurs, when it is spread to the city, it is said that "the cadres have committed 'left' leaning adventurist errors!" I feel that this is also unfair to this group of loyal people's servants.
　　Furthermore, those who were beaten to death, if sent to the court for legal judgment, should also be sentenced to death. The landlords who were beaten to death were not wronged, and the peasants would not beat them wrongly. Naturally, from the long-term interests of the peasants, violating the policies is not good, and the leadership has experience in correcting the so-called "overly left" situation in land reform, and it is quickly corrected. When we arrived in Jiangnan, the development of land reform was very normal, and there were basically no more cases of hanging and beating. Of course, the landlord class's broadcasting, spreading rumors, and slandering in the cities is another matter.
　　Some people say that the peasants now have the People's Government to support them, how dare the landlords do anything? This depends on whether the landlord class admits defeat and is willing to be beaten down. In fact, the landlord class does not admit defeat and is not willing. The landlord class not only has land, but also has armed forces, and was once the ruler of the countryside in military, political, economic, and ideological aspects. They have thousands of years of rich ruling experience and have mastered all kinds of ruling methods. Although the whole country has been liberated, they still have underground self-defense forces, reactionary secret societies, bandits and secret agents, and social and economic relations closely related to cities and other reactionaries. Their deep-rooted feudal rule with thousands of years of history will not honestly let go. In the land reform, the landlord class took advantage of the cadres' lack of experience and the peasants' weaknesses, instructed all the reactionary forces they could instruct, and adopted various kinds of resistance and sabotage to launch a counterattack against the peasants. Some landlords spread rumors, threatening the peasants, saying that "the Third World War is about to break out," "the American soldiers are about to attack Shanghai," and "Chiang Kai-shek has already arrived in Hongkou, Shanghai." Some landlords destroyed farming tools and slaughtered cattle to resist confiscation by "preventing everyone from using them." Some openly organized disturbances and assassinated militiamen; some sent henchmen to infiltrate the peasant associations and usurp leadership; some bribed cadres and denied their class status. In short, they tried their best to use all loopholes to carry out sabotage activities. Last year, when the American imperialist army landed in Incheon, Korea, and crossed the 38th parallel, the landlords' sabotage and counterattack reached their peak. In places where land reform had already been carried out, because of the government's leniency, the landlord class's prestige had not been defeated, and their restorationist ideas had greatly developed, and their arrogance towards the peasants became even higher. Some landlords took newspapers to scare the peasants, saying: "The Americans are coming! Divide the land!" Some pulled out the labels planted in the fields, tore off the "class bulletin boards," posted reactionary slogans, demolished houses, dug up floors, pretended to be ghosts and spirits, and set fire to rice stacks and houses. Peasants who were allocated the landlords' houses would throw manure into them, and carry dead people into them. Some allowed women to go to the doorsteps of the newly moved peasants and scold and curse: "Shameless! Whose land is it anyway! See if you can grow!..." They cursed the peasants' ancestors for three generations, until the peasants could not live there anymore, and were willing to give up the houses and return the land to the landlords, feeling that they had not been allocated the land, but had suffered a lot of anger. This shows that the landlord class has not admitted defeat. American imperialism is invading Korea and our territory, arming Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek is still in Taiwan. They will not be willing to be beaten down like this. They fantasize that the "old central government" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will "return," and feel that although there are difficulties at present, there is still "hope," and therefore say: They have "difficulties, solutions, and hope."
　　The reason why the landlord class is so bold, so daring to sabotage land reform, and so daring to launch a counterattack against the peasants is that, on the one hand, the suppression of reactionary landlords is insufficient, and on the other hand, individual cadres have overly emphasized "caution and steady progress," and the mobilization of the masses is not relaxed enough and not bold enough. Some local bullies and landlords were reported by the masses and arrested, but due to leniency, they were released on bail, and their arrogance became even higher. The landlords said: "Now you are dividing my land, just wait and see my skills, I will want their bones!" As a result, some peasants were very afraid, could not see their own strength, and had no confidence in land reform, saying that "the People's Government has no shoulders," and "rewards and punishments are unclear, and leniency is boundless."
　　Based on experience, the political prestige of the landlord class must be completely defeated, and leniency without combining it with suppression will not work.
　　As everyone knows, the general line of land reform is to rely on poor peasants and hired peasants, unite with middle peasants, and neutralize rich peasants. The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the experience summarized from two typical land reform experiments, also proposed "leading the masses to let go and boldly launch the movement" as the general policy for leading land reform. When we arrived in southern Jiangsu, the land reform movement was unfolding vigorously, and the anti-feudal revolutionary struggle was at its climax, with a very turbulent momentum and a very magnificent wave. The development of the movement was basically very normal. The peasants' emotions were very high, the great power of the peasant masses was brought into play, and the prestige of the landlords was defeated! The feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class was truly abolished, and the peasants' land ownership was implemented.
　　Now I will talk about the exciting new atmosphere I saw in the countryside after the land reform was carried out.
　　First of all, the peasants who turned over have independent personalities, truly became the masters of their own homes, have the idea of being the masters of their own homes, and overcame the inferiority complex of not daring to look directly at officials and "master" landlords in the past. When we went to the countryside, two armed comrades were with us for every five people, responsible for protecting us. When we went, we were very worried that our "airs" would prevent us from integrating with the peasants and rural cadres. Many of our professors and teachers wore glasses, wore leather coats, and had PLA soldiers with submachine guns beside them. Some cadres also said that we were the "land reform work team sent by Chairman Mao from Beijing, to help our peasant brothers turn over." We felt ashamed and worried, ashamed that we really knew too little about land reform, and worried that everyone would treat us differently. But the result was completely beyond our expectations! Not only did the peasants and rural cadres not regard us as being high above, but they were very kind and considerate to us, making each of us feel from the bottom of our hearts the loveliness of our peasants, brothers, and sisters who had turned over. First of all, the peasants did not treat us as guests, and were not strangers to us. When we were in the house, the peasant comrades naturally came in as a family, pushed the door open and came in, sat on our beds and chatted with us about the situation in Beijing, and asked us how old Chairman Mao was and how many children he had. When we held meetings with them, they could naturally point out our mistakes and understand our ignorance. They themselves were also very willing to accept criticism and correct mistakes. When we walked a little more in the rain, they said "The comrades from Beijing can really endure hardship!" They scrambled to do the hard work (and bearing weight) for us, and were very understanding of our weakness and incompetence. And they did not distinguish between each other, just like a family. The peasants were very clear that "it is all Chairman Mao's leadership," and there should be no distinction between each other. The peasant cadres also felt that it was an infinitely glorious thing to work for everyone. One night, it was raining heavily, and they walked back and forth for more than a dozen miles in the muddy fields that were so dark that they couldn't see their fingers to find someone to discuss the issue, and stayed up all night to work for everyone. When we saw them the next day, they were still smiling and working very enthusiastically. We asked them: "Are you tired?" Their answer was: "Serving the people is not tiring!" We deeply realized that: the peasants have stood up, they have the spirit of being masters, and they breathe in the real air of freedom.
　　Secondly, the peasants' awareness has been unprecedentedly improved. Land reform is a vigorous revolutionary movement, in which the peasants overthrew the landlord class and at the same time changed themselves. The land reform movement was led by the Communist Party and by collectivist ideology, and the peasants initially established the idea of collectivism in the movement. The six major slogans put forward by the East China Region: "Peasants unite and give way to each other, cadres are selfless and impartial, the purpose is to benefit production, the method is democratic consultation, the distribution is fair and reasonable, and the result is satisfactory to the masses." are collectivist slogans. When distributing land, if there is a problem, it can be solved satisfactorily according to the slogans and the spirit of "peasants all over the world are one family." When the personal interests and the overall interests are contradictory, the peasants will also have a little hesitation, but they can finally overcome the consideration of personal interests for the sake of the interests of all the peasants. When distributing land in Xigang Township, in order to achieve reasonable distribution, several peasant households had to move to other villages, and several peasant households had to plant distant fields. We saw that although they could not avoid a little hesitation, they were all willing to take the lead in moving away or planting distant fields. They said: "Now Chairman Mao has allocated land to us, what are we talking about far and near!"
　　In the land reform, the peasants themselves broke the superstition. In Xigang Township, we saw that many peasants no longer worshiped the clay Bodhisattvas. When we asked the peasants, they said: "We have thrown them all into the river! The masters (clay Bodhisattvas) only protect the landlords, not us. Now we respect Chairman Mao, not the masters." The peasants' demand for political and cultural learning is also very high. Once, we took a boat to a place with several peasant women who had turned over. They took a land reform handbook and grabbed it to read. They didn't recognize many characters, but they read it word by word. They sang a song with an old tune and new lyrics. These new lyrics were the result of a discussion by eight peasant women. They taught us this new song, and also asked us to teach them the songs we sang, and asked us to write down the lyrics for them.
　　The last stage of land reform is to hold a celebration meeting for the victory of land reform, summarize experience, launch the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and turn to production. On the basis of the victorious completion of land reform, the peasants quickly accepted the ideological education of patriotism. They are determined to liberate Taiwan. The peasants said: "The landlord class is not dead, unless Taiwan is liberated!" The peasants have personally suffered the pain of Japanese imperialism, they understand the meaning of resisting America and aiding Korea, they want to protect their homes, defend their country, and protect their turning over, and are unwilling to be trampled on and enslaved again! Tens of thousands of peasants who have turned over are asking to sign up for the army everywhere, and our People's Government naturally cannot satisfy this enthusiastic demand of the peasants. The peasants said: "The Kuomintang could not recruit soldiers, and joining the Communist army is like passing the imperial examination."
　　These all show how the peasants' awareness has been improved.
　　Furthermore, the peasants' production enthusiasm is exceptionally high. The peasants who had just been allocated land were so excited at night that they couldn't sleep well, and they had to get up several times in the middle of the night to go out and see the land they had just been allocated with the little red flags planted in it. They were happy from the bottom of their hearts! In Nanku Township, where we went, the peasants took all the grain confiscated from the landlords and bought cattle and farming tools.
　　Furthermore, in the vast countryside, we can see that the "people's democratic dictatorship" regime is exceptionally consolidated. The regime is truly in the hands of the people. The peasants not only elected the cadres they trusted, but also replaced the cadres they no longer trusted. The cadres who are supported by the peasants can rely on the masses on the one hand, and obey the leadership on the other hand, constantly learn, constantly progress, love the Communist Party, and love Chairman Mao. We deeply felt that Chairman Mao and the peasants who turned over have become so closely related through countless excellent cadres, becoming an inseparable organic whole! The "people's democratic dictatorship" regime has taken root in the vast countryside after land reform!
　　After this trip to the countryside, participating in the land reform movement, contacting the peasants, and seeing the new atmosphere in the countryside after land reform, I have infinite confidence in our new democratic revolution and construction, in resisting America and aiding Korea, and in the future of our great motherland! We have such people, who have mastered their own destiny, mastered their own regime, and breathe in the fresh, bright, and free air. How can they be willing to live the enslaved life of the reactionary ruling period again? Our motherland has such people and cannot be conquered! Comrade Qian Xuexi, a fellow traveler, said: "After seeing the land reform, we just need to work hard! There is no problem!" He spoke the minds of many people.
　　On my way back to Beijing, I thought about the land reform movement and its causes and consequences, and deeply understood how profound the meaning of Chairman Mao's saying "Intellectuals who do not combine with the workers and peasants will accomplish nothing" is!

　　人民民主专政在农村中生了根
    北京大学哲学系教授  胡世华
    我随北京各大学华东土地改革参观团到苏南去参观土地改革，二月八日离开北京，三月九日回来，来去一共一个月时间。就我这一次在土地改革中所学习到的来说，收获是非常之多的。我从来没有在这样短的时间内学到了这样多的东西。
    我刚到上海时与几位朋友一起谈话，其中有一位说：“现在乡下乱得很，地主被吊打！甚至在斗争的时候，大冷天把地主脱得精光，让他穿上冰冷的湿衣服。还有灌地主牛粪的。”因之感叹着“干部出偏差了！‘太左’了！”另一位朋友就说：“土地改革，改就是了，何必一定要斗呢？！”由于我自己在思想上也不够明确，所以我的解释，不能使他们满意。在我下乡之后，再回到上海时，我就能较好地向他们说明问题了。因为我知道了土地改革必须是一场系统的激烈的斗争。农民的斗争情绪必须发动起来，反动地主必须坚决镇压！
    土地改革本身是一个惊天动地的革命运动，是要在社会上废除地主这一个阶级的一件大事情，是要彻底改变中国社会的生产关系。毛主席早就说过，它是不能，也不可能“那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样‘温良恭俭让’”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》），因为土地改革是“推翻一个阶级的权力的暴烈的行动”，“不是请客吃饭，不是作文章，不是绘画绣花”（同上书）。
    在城里住久了的人，只听见地主挨了打，只听见地主吃了苦头。至于善良的劳苦农民过去是怎样惨痛地饱受折磨，我们知道得实在太少了！我们想像不出我们农村中的劳苦的兄弟姊妹们是如何痛苦地生活着，如何地在流汗，流泪，流血！我们想不到地主阶级的剥削残酷到什么程度！我们想不到地主阶级是怎样的在敲骨吸髓地压榨农民！我们想不到地主住的深院大宅，吃的丰富的膳食，穿的讲究的衣饰都是劳动人民血肉筋骨的变形！以往我为了个人利益，使我看不清这个事实！使我不能正确了解这个问题！农民诉苦的时候说：“农民受到地主的苦是三天三夜都说不尽！”其实农民受的苦岂止三天三夜说不尽呢！封建剥削实在是太残忍了。在我们到的吴江县的震泽区有所谓萧、邱、顾、董“四大家族”。由于这些恶霸地主对于农民的残酷压迫，老百姓都给他们起了确当的“雅号”，称之为：“萧剥皮”，“邱要命”，“顾挖心”，“董抽筋”。顾挖心曾把一个农民的初生婴儿，放在瓦片上，下面用炭火把婴儿慢慢烤死，给他当药吃，医治他的肺痨。烤孩子的那块瓦片至今还为诉苦的农民保存下来，上面有一个黑色的印子！又如江阴县杨舍镇有一个无恶不作的大恶霸陈春元。我现在举出他的残酷的罪行之一：杨舍镇的东北村有五个贫苦农民，好几天没有吃东西，饿得实在难过，偷了他家的五斗米，陈春元就把偷米的农民捉来，用筷子刨尖，插在他的耳朵里，双手用力一拍，即死！自然，这些是比较特殊的例子，然而以县以区为单位来说也不算少。至于地主对农民的霸占，吊打，勒索，侮辱更是数不清，讲不完了。这些成为农村的普遍现象，家常便饭。在收租米的时候，农民交不出租米被吊起来打得皮开血流。有些大地主家里还私设监牢，把交不出租米的农民关在牢里，关死的也不少。农民稍稍得罪了地主，就被地主灌牛粪，吊打，冬天剥光衣服掷到河里去，妻子女儿被强奸，田地耕畜农具被霸占的到处都有。有的地方收租米要收现款。收租米时与地主一气的米商把粮价压得低低的，等到收完租米，粮价又抬高了。地主以种种方法来欺榨农民，逼得农民典地卖房，卖儿卖女，出去当长工，当老妈子，坐监牢，上吊，寻死……。就我们这一团所到过的各个乡来说，每一个乡里关于恶霸地主残酷压迫农民，残害农民的事情，真是司空见惯，不足为奇了。我在溪港乡的村里与老百姓谈起往日地主的威势，当时就有两个农民露出腿背来给我看当日给地主打伤的一条一条的疤痕！拿我们去的一个震泽区来说，全乡只有六万人，因欠地租坐过牢的就有一千八百多人，经地主逼死的就有五百七十人，挨过打的有四百多人，被打死的就有三十五人，而震泽区并不是什么封建势力特别强的地方。农民在诉苦斗争的时候常常由于讲起他们以往的苦楚而哭起来，以至言不成声，有的一上台就哽咽住说不出话来，有年老的当场晕倒。震泽区的农民有一个歌谣，很充分地表示出他们受地主压迫的痛苦：
        农民身上两把刀：
        租米重，利息高。
        农民出路有三条：
        一跑，二牢，三上吊。而地主则说：“杀不了贫汉，当不了富汉！”
    我们的劳苦兄弟在残酷的封建统治下过着非人的生活！地主敲骨吸髓地剥削农民，使农民对地主痛恨入骨。一旦翻了身，由于义愤，由于积累的血仇，在一些斗争地主的会上打了地主，个别罪大恶极的地主在农民群众不可压抑的愤怒下被打死了，个别的地主被灌了牛粪，挨了冻，在大都市里就作为新闻传遍了！说是乡下乱了！可是无数农民挨了打，无数农民被打死了，烧死了，吊死了，杀死了，许多农民被灌了牛粪，许多农民被掷到河里去……就没有人讲了。地主在斗争会上吃了一点“苦头”，究竟是谁的罪过呢？难道说这种事情的产生不是由于地主阶级自己制造的罪过？难道说是当日在地主的淫威下面痛苦地讨生活的农民的罪过？难道说是当日为地主践踏着，在棍棒下流血呻吟的劳苦农民的罪过？如果说农民不应该，说农民对地主太厉害了，我认为，这是不公平的！这是不合理的！
    个别地主在斗争会上吃了一点苦头，就说干部有了偏差，也是不公平的。举一个例子来说明。我们这一个团到了一个屠塘乡，在第二天要斗争两个恶霸。这两个恶霸有过几条血案，平时无恶不作，农民恨之入骨。有两个农民前一天在讨论，说是第二天在斗争会上非把这两个恶霸打死不可，宁可自己偿命，他们的仇恨是非报不可的。当地的工作干部知道之后，就连夜向这两个农民进行说服教育，给他们贯彻政策思想。告诉他们：土地改革是全体农民的翻身大事，不是为了狭隘地报仇，为农民全体的利益不可以打。干部很耐心地向他们反复解释，提高他们的阶级觉悟，结果第二天斗争会上没有出事。绝大部分的干部是忠心耿耿地、忘我地为了农民大众的翻身大事而贡献他们的全部精力。一方面深切地在体会农民的要求；另一方面在尽力地掌握政策及上级的指示，不使这澎湃的土地改革运动溢出政策范围。向农民用种种方法，进行说服教育。一个干部如果在十个人之中说服了九个，有一个遗漏了，或者未被说服，出了一点乱子，传到城里时，于是就说“干部犯了‘左’倾冒险主义的错误！”我觉得，对于这一批忠诚的人民勤务员来说也是不公平的。
    再说那被打死的，如果送到法院去依法处判，也是应该判死刑的，打死的地主是不冤枉的，农民是不会错打的。自然，从农民的长久利益来看，违背政策是不好的，领导上对于所谓土地改革“过左”的情形是有经验的，纠正过来是很快的。我们到江南时，土地改革的发展是很正常的，基本上再没有吊打的事了。当然，地主阶级在城市中的广播、造谣和侮蔑是另一回事了。
    有人说，现在的农民有人民政府撑腰，地主还敢怎样？这要看地主阶级服不服输，甘心不甘心被打下去。事实上地主阶级是不服输的，不甘心的。地主阶级不单是有田，他们还有武装，在军事上、政治上、经济上、思想上都曾是乡村的统治者。他们有几千年的丰富的统治经验，掌握了种种统治的方法。虽然全国已经解放了，可是他们还有转入地下的自卫队，反动的会道门，土匪特务，与城市及其他反动派有密切联系的社会关系和经济关系。他们的有几千年历史的、根深蒂固的封建统治是不会那样老老实实地放手的。在土地改革中地主阶级利用了干部的缺乏经验和农民的弱点，指使了他们所能指使的一切反动势力，采取了各种各样的抵抗、破坏，向农民进行反攻。有些地主散布谣言，威吓农民，说什么“第三次世界大战就要爆发了”，“美国兵就要打到上海来”，“蒋介石已经到了上海虹口了”。有些地主破坏农具，屠宰耕牛，以“大家不能用”来抗拒没收。有的公开组织骚动，暗杀民兵；有的派遣爪牙混进农会，篡夺领导；有的收买干部，抵赖成分。总之，他们尽量利用一切空隙，进行破坏活动。去年美国帝国主义军队在朝鲜仁川登陆，越过三八线时，地主的破坏反攻达到了最高潮。在已经土地改革的地方，由于政府宽大，地主阶级的威风没有打下去，他们的复辟思想就大大发展起来，对于农民的气焰更加高涨起来。有的地主拿了报纸吓唬农民说：“美国人要来了！分田吧！”有的把田里插的标签拔去，把“阶级榜”撕掉，贴反动标语，拆房子，掘地板，装狐作鬼，放火烧稻堆、烧房子。农民分得了地主的房子，就把粪泼进去，把死人抬进去。有的让女人到新搬家的农民家门口去撒泼哭骂：“不要脸呀！到底是谁的田呀！看你们长得了长不了啊！……”祖宗三代地臭骂，直骂得农民住不下去了，宁愿把房子让出来，把田让还地主，觉得田倒没有分到，反而受了不少气。这表示地主阶级还没有服输。美国帝国主义正在侵略朝鲜和我们的国土，正在武装日本，蒋介石还在台湾，就这样被打下去是不会甘心的。他们幻想到蒋介石匪帮的“老中央”还会“回来”时，觉得目前虽有困难，然而还是有“希望”的，因之也说：他们是“有困难，有办法，有希望的”。
    地主阶级之所以那样胆大，所以那样敢于破坏土地改革，所以那样敢于向农民反攻，一方面由于对于反动地主的镇压不够，另一方面是个别干部过分强调了“谨慎小心，稳步前进”，发动群众不够放手，不够大胆的缘故。有些恶霸地主经过群众检举，抓起来了，由于宽大，交保释放之后，气焰更加高涨了。地主说：“现在分我的土地，将来看我的本领，要他们的骨头！”某些农民因之很害怕，看不出自己的力量，对于土地改革没有信心，说“人民政府没有肩胛”，“赏罚不明，宽大无边”。
    根据经验，地主阶级的政治威风是必须彻底打垮的，宽大不与镇压相结合是不行的。
    大家知道，土地改革的总路线是倚靠贫雇农，团结中农，中立富农。中共中央华东局根据了两次土地改革典型试验的经验总结，又提出了“有领导的放手发动群众，大胆展开运动”作为领导土地改革的总的方针。我们到达苏南时，土地改革运动正在轰轰烈烈地展开着，反封建的革命斗争正在高潮，气势十分汹涌，波澜异常壮阔。运动的发展，基本上是很正常的。农民的情绪很高涨，农民群众的伟大的力量发挥出来了，地主的威风被打倒了！真正的把地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制废除了，实行了农民的土地所有制。
    我现在来讲一下进行土地改革之后，在农村里见到的令人兴奋的新气象。
    首先，翻身农民有了独立的人格，真正的当了家作了主人，有了当家作主人的思想，克服了往日见了官吏，见了地主“大老爷”不敢正眼看一下的自卑心理。我们在下乡的时候，每五个人有两位武装同志与我们在一起，负保护我们的责任。去的时候我们很担心我们的“气派”会阻止我们与农民及乡村干部打成一片，我们许多教授先生都戴着眼镜，穿着皮大衣，旁边又有手拿冲锋枪的解放军。有的干部又说我们是北京“毛主席派来的土地改革工作队，来帮咱们农民兄弟翻身来的”。我们觉得又惭愧，又担心，惭愧的是我们对于土地改革实在知道得太少，担心的乃是怕大家对我们另眼看待。岂知道结果完全出乎我们意料之外！农民们，乡村干部们非但不把我们看得高高在上，而且对于我们非常之亲热与体贴，使我们每一个人从心坎里觉得我们的翻了身的农民兄弟姊妹们的可爱。首先，农民们并不把我们当客人，并不见外，我们在屋子里时，农民同志很自然地像一家人一样，一推门就进来了，坐在我们床上与我们话家常，问我们北京的情形，问我们毛主席有多大年纪，有几个小孩。与他们一道开会时，能够很自然地指出我们的错误和谅解我们的无知。他们自己又很能够接受批评，纠正错误。我们在雨中稍稍多走了一点路，他们就说“北京来的同志真能吃苦！”费力（与负重）的事他们抢着为我们去做，对于我们的文弱与无能十分体谅。而又不分彼此，真像一家人一样。农民们十分清楚“都是毛主席领导”，本不应有什么彼此。农民干部们又都觉得为大家办事是无上光荣的事情。有一天晚上，下着大雨，他们在黑暗得伸手不见五指的泥泞不堪的田野里来回走了十几里去找人商量问题，通夜不睡地为大家办事，第二天见他们时，他们照旧地满面笑容，十分起劲地在工作着。我们问他们：“辛苦了吧？”他们的回答是：“为人民服务，不辛苦！”我们深深地体会到：农民是站起来了，他们有主人翁的气概，他们呼吸在真正的自由的空气里了。
    其次，农民的觉悟空前地提高了。土地改革是一个轰轰烈烈的革命运动，在这运动里农民推翻了地主阶级，同时改变了自己。土地改革运动是共产党领导的，是集体主义思想领导的，农民在运动中初步建立了集体主义的思想。华东区提出的六大口号：“农民团结互让，干部大公无私，目的有利生产，方法民主协商，分配公平合理，结果群众满意。”就是集体主义的口号。在分配土地的时候，一有问题，即能根据口号，根据“天下农民是一家”的精神把问题圆满解决。在个人利益与整体利益矛盾时，农民也会有一点犹豫，然而终于能够为了全体农民的利益，克服了个人利益的考虑。在溪港乡分配土地时，为了要做到合理分配，必须有若干户农民搬到别村去，若干户农民种远田。我们看出他们虽然不免稍有犹豫，而结果都愿自己带头搬去，或种远田。他们说：“现在毛主席给我们分了田，还说什么远啊近啊！”
    在土地改革中农民自己破除了迷信。我们在溪港乡看见许多农民都不去敬泥菩萨了，问起农民时，他们说：“都给我们掷到河里去了！老爷（泥菩萨）只保佑地主，不保佑我们。我们现在敬毛主席，不敬老爷了。”农民对政治文化学习的要求也非常之高。我们有一次与几个翻身农妇一同乘船到一个地方去，她们拿了一本土地改革手册你抢我夺地看，她们认得的字还不多，只是一个字一个字地读。她们唱着一个旧调新词的歌子，这新词是八个农妇开会讨论的结果。她们教会了我们这一支新歌，又让我们教她们唱我们唱的歌，并要我们把歌词写下来给她们。
    土地改革最后一个阶段是开庆祝土地改革胜利大会，总结经验，展开抗美援朝运动，转入生产。农民在土地改革胜利完成的基础上，很快地就接受了爱国主义的思想教育。他们有决心解放台湾。农民说：“地主阶级是不死心的，除非台湾解放！”农民身受过日本帝国主义的痛苦，他们懂得抗美援朝的意义，他们要保家卫国保翻身，不愿意再被践踏被奴役！到处都有上万的翻身农民要求报名参军，我们的人民政府自然不能满足农民的这种热情的要求。农民说：“国民党抓丁抓不到，共产党参军像考秀才。”
    这些，都说明农民的觉悟是怎样地提高了。
    复次，农民的生产情绪异常的高涨。刚分到田地的农民晚上兴奋得连睡觉都睡不好，半夜要起来好几次，出门去看看他新分得的插着小红旗的田。从心坎里高兴出来！我们到的一个南库乡，农民把所有没收地主的粮食，全部拿来买了耕牛和农具。
    复次，在广大的农村里，我们看出“人民民主专政”的政权是异常地巩固了。政权真正地掌握在人民的手里了。农民不但选举了自己信任的干部，还撤换了自己不再信任的干部。为农民所拥戴的干部都能一方面依靠群众，一方面服从领导，不断学习，不断进步，热爱共产党，热爱毛主席。我们深深感觉到毛主席与翻身农民之间通过了无数优秀的干部已经是那样息息相关，成为不可分的有机的整体了！“人民民主专政”的政权经过土地改革之后已经在广大的农村里生了根！
    经过了这一次的下乡，参加了土地改革运动，接触到农民，看到了土地改革后的农村新气象，使我对于我们新民主主义的革命建设，对于抗美援朝，对于我们伟大祖国的前途有了无限信心！我们有这样的人民，掌握了自己的命运，掌握了自己的政权，呼吸在新鲜的，光明的，自由的空气里，他们岂能再愿意过反动统治时期的奴役生活？我们祖国有了这样的人民，是不可被征服的！同伴的钱学熙同志说：“看了土地改革，我们只要努力就是了！没有问题了！”说出了许多人的心情。
    在我回北京的途中一路思考土地改革运动及其前因后果，深深地领会到毛主席说的“知识分子不与工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”这句话是有多么深刻的意义！
