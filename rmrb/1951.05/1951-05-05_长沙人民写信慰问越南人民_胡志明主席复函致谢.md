　　Changsha People Write Letters of Condolence to the Vietnamese People
    Ho Chi Minh Replies with a Letter of Thanks
    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] Teachers and students from over twenty units including universities, middle schools, and elementary schools in Changsha City, Hunan Province, and the Changsha City Paper Industry Union, wrote letters this spring to express their condolences to the heroic Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese People's Army. President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently replied with a letter of thanks. The original letter is as follows: Dear friends,
    You have sent many letters to our Vietnamese People's Army, government, and myself, encouraging us and wishing us victory over the French aggressors and American interventionists, and striving for national unification and independence. On behalf of the Vietnamese People's Army and government, I sincerely thank you. Under the loving education and leadership of the great Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese People's Government, you have linked patriotism with internationalism, and are as concerned about the Vietnamese revolution, the world revolution, and the Chinese revolution. This is excellent. I hope you will study hard and work hard to build a new China. At the same time, help us build a new Vietnam, and serve as model elder brothers and sisters for our Vietnamese youth. I send you my dearest embraces from afar.
              Your old Uncle Ho Chi Minh
