Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The Capital People's Welcome Committee for the Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea held a welcoming rally for the Comfort Mission at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the evening of the 30th. Present were responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations, representatives from all walks of life in the capital, and cadres from agencies and troops, totaling more than 5,000 people.

The conference began with a welcoming speech by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China People's 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) General Association. He expressed a warm welcome and respect on behalf of the people of the capital to the members of the Comfort Mission to Korea who had returned victoriously. Chairman Guo Moruo said: The Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea greatly encouraged the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people. The Comfort Mission has completed arduous and important tasks in Korea. Now that they have returned to the motherland, they will report to the people of the whole country the victorious deeds of the Chinese and Korean people and the brutal crimes of the enemy. In addition to the planned hundred-plus reports to be made in the capital, the Comfort Mission will also conduct widespread communication reports throughout the country within a month to strengthen, expand, and deepen the 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) movement. He hoped that the Comfort Mission would successfully complete this task.

Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea, reported on the work of the Comfort Mission, saying: For the past month and a half, our Comfort Mission has shouldered the glorious task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland, and comforted the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people on the front lines and in the rear of Korea. We handed over the various慰劳品 (comfort items) and慰劳金 (comfort money) that we brought with us. We conveyed to the Volunteer Army the determination of the people of the whole country to make persistent efforts in 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea), which strengthened their vigorous fighting will. We saw the indomitable and majestic spirit of the Chinese and Korean people's armies, which made us even more convinced that the war of resistance against America will surely achieve the final and complete victory. In his report, Commander Liao Chengzhi listed many moving deeds of the unity and close cooperation between the Chinese and Korean people in joint combat, and said: The Korean people expressed their infinite gratitude for the sincere and selfless assistance of the Chinese people. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, which has grown in battle, is an unbreakable guarantee of victory. Commander Liao Chengzhi finally called on the people of the whole country to continue to launch the 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) movement and contribute greater and more strength to support the People's Volunteer Army and the Korean military and civilians in order to completely eliminate the American aggressors in Korea as soon as possible.

Chen Yi, Deputy Head of the Comfort Mission, reported on the great patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front. He said: The fighting on the Korean front is arduous, and there are many difficulties; however, no difficulties can intimidate all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. All kinds of huge difficulties have been conquered by them. They have shown on the battlefield that they are the bravest army in the world against the enemy and the most benevolent to the people. He said: The comrades of the People's Volunteer Army want us to tell the people of the whole country after returning home, please rest assured that they are good sons and daughters of our people, and will never fail to live up to the glorious title of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They are determined to avenge the Korean people, win glory for the motherland, and make contributions to the people of the world. Chen Yi finally stated in his speech: All members of the Comfort Mission will do their best to convey to the people of the whole country the heroic fighting situation of the Chinese and Korean people's armies and promote the 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) movement of the people of the whole country.

Zhou Jingwen, the representative of the democratic parties in the Comfort Mission, briefly reported on the heroic deeds he saw and heard on the front lines and in the rear of Korea on behalf of the representatives of the democratic parties. He said, "In the future, our democratic parties must strengthen the work of 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea), 保家卫国 (Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country), mobilize the people of the whole country to work hard to support the front lines, step up production and construction, launch donation movements, and ensure that our soldiers can eat their fill and dress warmly, and have more airplanes, more cannons, more anti-aircraft guns, more tanks, and more cars to more heavily strike the American aggressors and more quickly eliminate the enemy."

Zhao Guoyou, the representative of the people's organizations in the Comfort Mission, reported on the situation of workers and farmers in Korea who insisted on production and supported the front lines in the war with a selfless spirit. He assured the conference on behalf of the people's organizations: We must better mobilize the people of the whole country to carry out labor competitions, do a good job in various tasks, study hard, and actively support the Chinese and Korean people's troops.

Chen Sisheng, the representative of the industrial and commercial circles in the Comfort Mission, said in his report: We have personally witnessed that most of the cities and villages in Korea have been brutally destroyed by the enemy. Most of the industries and businesses in Korea have been destroyed by the enemy. This fully proves that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of our industrial and commercial circles. He called on the industrial and commercial circles of the whole country to earnestly implement patriotic covenants, vigorously carry out donation movements, and give full play to the strength of the industrial and commercial circles to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with more airplanes, cannons, tanks, and automobiles.

Finally, Guo Moruo called on the people of the whole country to make persistent efforts to launch the 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) movement, enthusiastically donate, do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of the People's Volunteer Army, and strive for the early arrival of the comprehensive, thorough, and final victory of the Chinese and Korean people's war against America.

    大会首由中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若致欢迎辞。他代表首都各界人民对胜利归来的赴朝慰问团人员表示热烈欢迎和敬意。郭沫若主席说：中国人民赴朝慰问团给了中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民以极大鼓舞。慰问团在朝鲜完成了艰巨的、重大的任务，现在回到祖国来，还要把在朝鲜所看到的中朝人民的胜利事迹，和敌人的残暴罪行，向全国人民报告。慰问团除已计划在首都要作一百余次报告外，还要在一个月内到全国各地普遍进行传达报告，加强、扩大、深入抗美援朝运动。希望慰问团顺利地完成这一任务。
    中国人民赴朝慰问团团长廖承志报告慰问团工作经过说：一个半月来，我们慰问团肩负祖国人民给予我们的光荣任务，在朝鲜前线和后方慰问了我国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民。我们把带去的各种慰劳品和慰劳金交给了他们。我们把全国人民再接再厉抗美援朝的决心，传达给志愿军，加强了他们的旺盛的战斗意志。我们看到了中朝人民军队的无坚不摧的雄壮气概，使我们更加相信：抗美战争一定可以得到最后的完全的胜利。廖承志团长在报告中列举了中朝人民共同作战的团结无间的许多动人事迹之后说：朝鲜人民对我国人民的真诚无私的援助，表示了无限的感激。在战斗中成长的中朝人民的友谊，是牢不可破的胜利保证。廖承志团长最后号召全国人民继续展开抗美援朝运动，拿出更大更多的力量来支援人民志愿军和朝鲜军民，以早日完全消灭在朝鲜的美国侵略军。
    慰问团副团长陈沂报告中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线所表现出来的伟大的爱国主义、国际主义、革命英雄主义的精神。他说：朝鲜前线的战斗是艰苦的，困难也是很多的；但是，任何的困难都吓不倒中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员战斗员。各种巨大的困难都被他们征服了。他们已在战场上表现出自己是世界上的一支对敌人最勇敢、对人民最仁慈的军队。他说：人民志愿军的同志们要我们回国后告诉全国人民，请大家放心，他们是我国人民的好儿女，绝不辜负中国人民志愿军这个光荣的称号，决心为朝鲜人民报仇，为祖国争光，为世界人民立功。陈沂在讲话中最后表示：慰问团全体团员一定尽力向全国人民传达中朝人民军队英勇战斗的情况，推动全国人民的抗美援朝运动。
    慰问团中的民主党派代表周鲸文在讲话中简要地报告了各民主党派代表在朝鲜前线和后方所看所闻的英勇事迹后说：“我们各民主党派，今后一定要加强抗美援朝保家卫国的工作，动员全国人民大众来努力支援前线，加紧生产建设，发动捐献运动，全国人民有钱的出钱，有力的出力，要保证我们的战士能够吃得饱饱的，穿得暖暖的，而且有更多的飞机，更多的大炮，更多的高射炮，更多的坦克，更多的汽车，来更重地打击美国侵略者，更迅速地把敌人消灭。”
    慰问团中的各人民团体代表赵国有报告了朝鲜各业工人和朝鲜农民以忘我的精神在战争中坚持生产支援前线的情形。他代表各人民团体向大会保证：一定更好地发动全国人民开展劳动竞赛，做好各项工作，努力学习，积极支援中朝人民部队。
    慰问团中的工商界代表陈巳生在报告中说：我们亲眼看到朝鲜的城市和乡村大部惨遭敌人的残酷破坏。朝鲜各地工商业大部被敌人摧毁。这完全证明了美帝国主义是我们工商界的死敌。他号召全国工商界要切实实行爱国公约，大力开展捐献运动，高度发挥工商界的力量，支援中国人民志愿军以更多的飞机、大炮、坦克、汽车。
    最后，郭沫若号召全国人民再接再厉地展开抗美援朝运动，热烈捐献，作好优待人民志愿军家属的工作，争取中、朝人民抗美战争的全面的、彻底的最后胜利早日到来。
