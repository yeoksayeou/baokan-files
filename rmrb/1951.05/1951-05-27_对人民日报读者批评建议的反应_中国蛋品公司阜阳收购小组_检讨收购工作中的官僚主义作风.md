To the Editor:

    The criticism published in your newspaper on April 30th regarding the interruption of egg acquisition by our Fuyang Egg Acquisition Team, the sharp drop in prices, and the rude attitude towards the masses, which affected production and disaster relief, was very helpful to us.  Now, we present a detailed account of this matter and a self-criticism report as follows:

    We were ordered to acquire eggs on February 15th.  Less than half a month after the acquisition began, the incoming goods exceeded the numbers we had planned in advance. We immediately requested our superiors to allocate wooden crates and applied to the bank for loans to continue the acquisition. On February 26th, the superior acquisition team received our letter urging the delivery of crates, and on February 27th, they entrusted a private shipping company to transport two thousand crates to us. However, due to delays in the ship's departure and en route, it did not arrive in Fuyang until March 20th, approximately ten days later than originally scheduled. Consequently, we were forced to suspend acquisitions. This was the bad result of insufficient planning and lack of prior investigation and research on our part. During the suspension of acquisitions, the matter of rudely treating the masses occurred. For example, when someone reflected that "the capital is all used up," our cadres said, "Go, go, go, I can't do anything if you've used it all up." When others asked about the acquisition time and price, they said, "I don't know. We'll collect it when the crates arrive, we can't control that." This aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. This is a concrete manifestation of our usual lack of education for cadres, and the lack of political cultivation and weak mass perspective of our responsible cadres themselves.

    As for the acquisition price, it was revised by the superior acquisition team based on the market price. Our mistake was that we did not explain it well to the masses.

    The above situation fully demonstrates that we still have a serious bureaucratic work style, and we are determined to correct it in the future.

                               China Egg Products Company, Wanbei Fuyang Acquisition Team, Wang Zhenya

　　对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中国蛋品公司阜阳收购小组  检讨收购工作中的官僚主义作风编辑同志：
    四月三十日贵报刊载了对我们阜阳蛋品收购小组收购中断、价格猛降，并以生硬态度对待群众，影响生产救灾的批评，对我们很有帮助。现在把这件事的详细经过及检讨报告如下：
    我们于二月十五日奉令收蛋。开收后不到半个月，来货突破了我们在事前计划的数字。我们即向上级要求调拨木箱，并向银行贷款继续收购。二月二十六日，上级收购组收到了我们催要箱子的信，二十七日他们就委托私营轮船给我们运来二千只箱子，但因该轮船启程与中途都有耽搁，以致于在三月二十日才到达阜阳。比原预订日期晚了十天左右，因而，我们被迫停购。这是我们计划性不够，事先缺乏调查研究所遭致的恶果。在停购期间，便发生了以生硬态度对待群众的事情。如有人反映“本钱吃光了”，我们的干部却说：“走走走，你吃光了我也没办法。”别人问收购时间和价格，他们又是说：“不知道，箱皮什么时候到什么时候收，我们管不着。”因而引起群众不满。这是我们平时对干部缺乏教育，我们负责干部自己也缺乏政治修养，群众观点不强的具体表现。
    至于收购价格，则是上级收购组根据市价改订的。我们的错误是没有很好地向群众作解释。
    以上情况充分说明我们还存在着严重的官僚主义作风，我们今后决心改正。
