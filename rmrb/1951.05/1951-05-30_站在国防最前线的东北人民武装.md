　　Growing and Strengthening

　　The Northeast Military Region's People's Armed Forces have greatly developed over the past year. Currently, the number of militiamen in the entire region has more than doubled compared to the year before last; the number of self-defense team members in the entire region has also increased by more than 21% compared to the year before last. The region has established organizational structures for the People's Armed Forces: the Northeast Military Region has established a People's Armed Forces Department, each province has established a Military Department, and each Special Commissioner's Office, county, and district has established a People's Armed Forces Department, responsible for developing organizations and conducting military and political education. The People's Armed Forces in various regions have gradually improved their quality through military and political training. According to the results of a study test held in August last year for militiamen in sixteen counties, including Yushu and Helong in Jilin Province, the average score for military subjects was 82.3, and the average score for political subjects was 87.7. Militiamen in each province have initially learned military movements; in areas with better military training, they have already transitioned to technical education. In the past winter and this spring, the militiamen in each province have completed an average of 80 hours of military and political education. Various regions have also established a system of military exercises based on districts and the organization of winter training committees.

　　Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, especially after the people of the whole country launched the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country, rural youths in various parts of Northeast China have actively joined the militia organization in order to protect their homes and defend the country and consolidate local security. According to statistics, more than 97% of young and middle-aged people in Wangqing County, Jilin Province, have joined the militia, and the average percentage of young and middle-aged people in other counties participating in the militia is also above 50%.

　　In the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, and Defend the Country

　　After the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country was launched in the entire Northeast region with overwhelming momentum, many militiamen from various regions joined the Chinese People's Volunteers or volunteer stretcher teams and went to the Korean battlefield. The Northeast Militia Volunteer Stretcher Teams performed very heroically on the Korean battlefield. Among the 1,108 militiamen from Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, who participated in the first counterattack campaign by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, 74 were commended for their meritorious service and seized 15 American-style rifles. Chen Daming, a militiaman stretcher-bearer from Ji'an County, took off his own clothes to cover the wounded, fearing that the cold would damage their wounds. They used their own rice bowls to collect the wounded's excrement and urine. Militiaman Li Zhishan used his own money to buy chicks to make dishes for the wounded. Some militiaman stretcher-bearers shielded the wounded with their bodies when enemy planes strafed them. This great spirit of patriotism moved all the volunteer stretcher-bearers, so most of the stretcher teams ensured the smooth completion of their transportation tasks and brought back lofty honor to the motherland.

　　The Northeast People's Armed Forces have played a significant role in consolidating the people's regime and defending the country's borders. Militiamen in Liaodong, Jilin, and other provinces strengthened their sentry and guard duties after the outbreak of the Korean War. The militiamen not only assisted the regular troops in monitoring enemy aircraft and inspecting passing pedestrians but also assisted the public security departments in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and consolidating local security. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the militiamen in the entire region cooperated with the public security departments to solve a total of 735 cases of bandits and secret agents, 1,617 cases of petty theft, 610 cases of secret agents spreading rumors, and 1,105 cases of smuggling; they killed a total of 43 bandits, captured 401 bandits alive, and captured 59 secret agents alive; they seized 976 rifles and pistols, 8 light and heavy machine guns, 1 mortar, and more than 52,000 rounds of ammunition; and recovered 893 livestock and 12 carts.

　　The militiamen in various provinces have universally organized road protection committees and road protection groups, and those in forest areas have organized forest protection and fire prevention teams. According to statistics, in Jilin Province alone, 23,350 militiamen along the railway participated in road protection groups, and this year they helped build 225 kilometers of railways; 73 militiamen were awarded the title of "Road Protection Model."

　　On the Labor Front

　　The Northeast People's Armed Forces are not only a powerful pillar for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship but also leaders and backbones in rural production. According to incomplete statistics from Jilin and Songjiang provinces, more than 85% of the militia cadres participated in mutual aid teams, of which 9,266 were responsible for leading the mutual aid teams. In Huadian County, Jilin Province, 162 militiamen were awarded the title of labor model. According to the statistics of the labor model representative conference in Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, militiamen accounted for 48% of the 273 labor models who attended the conference. Militiamen from five counties, including Shulan in Jilin Province, reclaimed 451 hectares of wasteland last year. Militiamen from Jilin, Liaodong, and other provinces participated in repairing bridges, building houses, and repairing roads, earning a total of 3,177.75 million yuan, which thoroughly solved the "fear of delaying work" that was widespread among the militiamen. The militiamen in Heilongjiang Province also made great achievements in sideline production. For example, Xingcun Village in Jingxing County experienced a poor harvest last year. Militia cadres Wang Xiaosheng, Yang Zhendong, and others responded to the government's call for "frugality to overcome famine and self-reliance through production" and mobilized the entire village's militiamen to engage in sideline occupations. In just one month, each person earned three shi of grain, solving the problem of living difficulties.

　　Yao Shusheng, a disabled veteran and militiaman from Heping Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Labor Models, is a banner of the combination of labor and armed forces in the Northeast militia. He often gets up at night to check the sentry posts. One night, a fire broke out in the village cooperative. He immediately wetted his clothes and bravely jumped onto the roof to put out the fire, saving the masses' property from loss. During the spring plowing and summer hoeing last year, he mobilized 35 militiamen and 20 farmers in his team to complete the plan of five plows and six hoeings. The 150 hectares of land produced an additional 30 dan of grain.

　　站在国防最前线的东北人民武装
    鹿野
            发展壮大中
    东北军区人民武装一年来有了很大的发展。目前，全区民兵已较前年增加了两倍以上；全区自卫队员也较前年增加了百分之二十一以上。全区已建立了人民武装的组织机构：东北军区设立了人民武装处，各省设立了军事部，各专署、县、区都设立了人民武装部，负责发展组织和进行军事政治教育等工作。各地人民武装经过军事和政治的训练，逐步提高了素质。根据吉林省榆树、和龙等十六个县的民兵去年八月份举行学习测验的结果：军事课平均分数是八十二点三，政治课平均分数是八十七点七。各省民兵均已初步学会了军事动作；在军事训练较好的地区已经转入技术教育。各省民兵在去冬和今春，平均已经完成了八十小时的军政教育。各地并建立了以区为单位的会操制度和冬训委员会的组织。
    美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，特别是全国人民掀起抗美援朝保家卫国运动以后，东北各地农村青年，为了保家卫国，巩固地方治安，更踊跃地参加民兵组织。据统计，吉林省汪清县百分之九十七以上的青壮年都参加了民兵，其他各县青壮年参加民兵组织的平均也在百分之五十以上。
            在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中
    东北全境以排山倒海之势掀起抗美援朝保家卫国的运动以后，各地民兵有很多人参加了中国人民志愿军或志愿担架队，纷纷走向朝鲜战场。东北民兵志愿担架队在朝鲜战场上表现得非常英勇。辽东省辑安县参加中朝人民部队第一次反攻战役的担架队一千一百零八名民兵中，有七十四名立了功，并缴获了美式步枪十五支。辑安县民兵担架队员陈大明怕伤员冻坏伤口，把自己的衣服脱下来给伤员盖上。他们拿自己的饭碗给伤员接屎接尿。民兵李志山拿自己的钱买小鸡给伤员做菜吃。有的民兵担架队员，在敌机扫射时，将自己身体伏在伤员身上保护伤员。他们这种爱国主义的伟大精神，感动了全体志愿担架队员，因此，大部分担架队都保证了运输任务的顺利完成，给祖国带回了崇高的荣誉。
    东北人民武装在巩固人民政权和保卫祖国边防方面起了很大作用。辽东、吉林等省的民兵，在朝鲜战争发生后，即加强了站岗放哨工作。民兵们不仅协助正规部队监视敌机，盘查往来行人，而且协助公安部门镇压反革命，巩固地方治安。据不完全的统计，去年一年中，全区民兵配合公安部门共破获土匪、特务案件七百三十五次，小偷案件一千六百一十七次，特务造谣案件六百一十次及走私案件一千一百零五次；先后共打死土匪四十三名，活捉土匪四百零一名，活捉特务五十九名；缴获长短枪九百七十六支，轻重机枪八挺，迫击炮一门，子弹五万二千多发；追回牲口八百九十三匹，大车十二台。
    各省民兵普遍组织了护路委员会和护路小组，靠森林地区组织了护林防火队。据统计，仅吉林省沿铁路地区就有二万三千三百五十名民兵参加了护路小组，今年帮助修筑铁路二百二十五公里；有七十三名民兵得到“护路模范”的称号。
            在劳动战线上
    东北人民武装不仅是巩固人民民主专政的有力支柱，而且是农村生产中的带头者和骨干分子。据吉林、松江两省的不完全统计，民兵干部参加变工互助组的有百分之八十五以上，其中有九千二百六十六名担负了互助组的领导工作。吉林省桦甸县民兵荣获劳动模范称号的，即有一百六十二名。据辽西新民县劳动模范代表大会统计，参加大会的二百七十三名劳动模范中，民兵占百分之四十八。吉林省舒兰等五个县的民兵，去年开荒四百五十一垧。吉林、辽东等省民兵参加修理桥梁、盖房、修公路等零工，共赚钱三十一亿七千七百五十万元，使民兵普遍存在的“怕误工”的思想，获得了彻底的解决。黑龙江省民兵在副业生产方面也有很大成绩。如景星县杏山村去年歉收，民兵干部王孝生、杨振东等响应政府“节约度荒，生产自救”的号召，动员全村民兵搞副业，仅一个月每人就赚粮食三石，解决了生活困难。
    出席全国战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议的黑龙江省克山县和平村荣誉军人、民兵姚树盛，是东北民兵中劳（动）武（装）结合的一面旗帜。他经常晚上起来查哨，有一天夜间，村合作社失火，他立即打湿衣服，奋不顾身地跳上房把火扑灭，使群众财产免遭损失。去年春耕夏锄时，他发动全队三十五名民兵和二十个农民完成五铲六趟的计划，一百五十垧地，即多打了粮食三十大石。
