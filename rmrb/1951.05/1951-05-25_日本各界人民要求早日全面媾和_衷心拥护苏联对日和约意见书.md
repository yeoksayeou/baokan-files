Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The Soviet Union's opinion on the Japanese peace treaty issue has received widespread support in Japan. According to a report by the United Press, Hosokawa Kahiroku, head of the Japanese Communist Party's Diet delegation, stated on May 8th: The Soviet proposal is the only way for Japan to achieve national independence and safeguard world peace; it is also the only way for Japan's economy to achieve autonomy. On the same day, Nakahara Kenji, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Labor-Farmer Party, also expressed his support for the Soviet position in a statement. He said: The wave of the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence will be further strengthened from now on.

The "Patriotic Movement Council for Overall Peace" issued a statement saying: The Japanese people wholeheartedly support and welcome the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers to prepare for a Japanese peace treaty. The separate peace negotiations conducted by Dulles and Yoshida are illegal and invalid. The statement also pointed out: If the People's Republic of China does not participate in the Japanese peace treaty, Japan cannot achieve peace or be revived.

Even Takano Minoru, the secretary-general of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which is influenced by the Socialist Party, expressed his support for the Soviet Union's suggestions on procedural issues, the development of peaceful industries, and the withdrawal of occupying forces in the opinion. He said: The US plan for a separate peace treaty with Japan is clearly in a disadvantageous position due to the Soviet Union's opinion. We firmly demand an early overall peace.

In addition, trade union organizations such as the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union have also expressed their support for the Soviet Union's opinion and demanded the conclusion of an overall peace treaty.

　　日本各界人民要求早日全面媾和
    衷心拥护苏联对日和约意见书
    【新华社二十四日讯】苏联关于日本和约问题的意见书，在日本受到广泛的拥护。据联合通讯社消息，日本共产党国会议员团团长细川嘉六在五月八日发表谈话说：苏联的建议是日本获得民族独立与保障世界和平的唯一道路；也是使日本的经济获得自主的唯一道路。同日，劳农党中央执行委员中原健次也在谈话中表示支持苏联的立场。他说：日本人民争取和平与独立的斗争浪潮，自此将更为加强。
    “全面媾和爱国运动协议会”发表声明说：日本人民衷心拥护和欢迎苏联关于召开四国外长会议准备对日和约的建议。杜勒斯与吉田所进行的单独媾和是不合法的，并且也是无效的。声明又指出：如果对日和约没有中华人民共和国的参加，日本是不能获得和平也不会复兴的。
    就是社会党影响下的日本工会总评议会的事务局局长高野实也表示赞成苏联意见书中关于程序问题、发展和平工业、撤退占领军诸项建议。他说：美国对日单独媾和的计划因苏联提出意见书而显然处于不利的地位。我们坚决要求早日全面媾和。
    此外，日本自治团体工会联合会等工会团体，也纷纷表示拥护苏联的意见书，要求缔结全面和约。
