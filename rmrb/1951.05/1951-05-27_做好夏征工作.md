　　Do a Good Job in the Summer Tax Collection
    The summer agricultural tax collection is about to begin. On the 25th of this month, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on the 1951 Summer Collection of Public Grain." Although summer tax collection is not as widespread as autumn tax collection, it is still a major event related to hundreds of millions of farmers and the country's finances. This year's summer tax collection work is taking place after the vast new areas have just completed land reform. The feudal land system in these areas has been eliminated, and farmers no longer have to pay rent to landlords, but they still have many difficulties in production. Many plots of land with seedlings were transferred during the land reform process, creating many complex problems in summer harvesting and burden allocation. At the same time, in areas where land reform has been completed, land certificate fees will also begin to be collected after the summer harvest. Therefore, this year's summer tax collection is an arduous and complex task.
    To do a good job in the summer tax collection, what issues should we pay attention to?
    First, appropriately allocate the summer and autumn tax collection ratios. Last year, many regions achieved tax collection according to the rate, but they did not appropriately determine the summer and autumn collection ratios, resulting in the disadvantage of "light summer and heavy autumn," which caused difficulties for farmers in autumn payment. This year, in addition to conducting field surveys and determining production in all regions without exception, and strictly collecting taxes according to the rate, it is also necessary to appropriately determine the summer and autumn collection ratios. So, what are the principles for determining the summer and autumn collection ratios? Generally speaking, it should be determined roughly according to the proportion of summer and autumn yields in the total annual yield. For example, if summer and autumn harvests each account for half, then the summer tax collection should generally account for half of the total annual tax amount. In another region, if the summer harvest accounts for one-third of the total annual yield and the autumn harvest accounts for two-thirds, then the summer tax collection should generally account for one-third of the total annual tax amount. However, in some areas where the summer harvest is small and the vast majority of farmers rely on it to survive the lean season, the amount of tax collection can be reduced appropriately. In some areas where the summer harvest is large and farmers have a surplus for consumption, more taxes can be collected. As for individual households in the same area whose summer harvest is particularly small compared to ordinary farmers, they should also be taken care of, and taxes should be reduced or exempted separately, and supplementary taxes should be collected after the autumn harvest in accordance with tax law regulations. Land that has not been planted with summer crops (including land planted with cotton and tobacco) should be taxed once in the autumn to eliminate farmers' concerns about planting cash crops such as cotton and tobacco.
    In areas that have just completed land reform, another important issue in this year's summer tax collection is the burden caused by the transfer of land with seedlings. When distributing land during land reform, land with crops already planted or land that has just been fertilized may not be distributed to the original tenant farmers. This requires handling according to the principles of "who plants, who harvests, who bears the burden" and "protecting the fruits of labor" to avoid causing disputes among farmers and affecting the summer tax collection work.
    Second, do a good job in warehousing and taking care of the grain-delivery masses. Summer is hot and rainy, so doing a good job in the summer tax collection warehousing work is not an easy task. Cadres at all levels should, on the basis of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, deeply mobilize farmers to pay good grain, and carefully check the quality of the grain, especially to instruct cadres at the township (village) level to earnestly check. County and district governments should formulate detailed grain delivery and receipt plans, do a good job in all organizational and material preparations, and pay attention to solving problems such as tea, water, food, lodging, and medical care for grain delivery personnel and livestock, to prevent casualties. In last year's tax collection, some regions, in their eagerness to transition to land reform, ordered farmers to deliver all the grain to the warehouse within a short period of time, and the grain was not dried sufficiently and had excessive moisture content; if the moisture content were to be reduced to the 13% safety standard, the difference would be equal to 250,000 tons of public grain, which is an alarming loss. Grain that is too wet is prone to mold and sprout, resulting in even greater losses. Casualties among grain delivery personnel and livestock were greatly reduced last year compared to the past, but such incidents still occurred in some provinces. It is hoped that this shortcoming will be effectively prevented in this year's summer tax collection.
    Third, appropriately determine the types of items to be collected. Here, the following issues should be considered: 1. In order to ensure the grain necessary for the country, wheat should be collected in all wheat-producing areas during this year's summer tax collection. In areas where wheat cannot be collected, a portion of cash, miscellaneous grains, and cash crops should be collected as appropriate. Cotton households may be allowed to offset the summer public grain with cotton, and the parity price should not be lower than the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on this year's cotton-grain parity price. The collection of cash crops should be handled jointly by the financial departments and the trade and cooperation departments after signing a contract. 2. Some areas are rich in silkworm cocoons, spring tea, and fruit trees, and sell them in large quantities in summer. For these areas, consideration may be given to collecting a portion of currency as appropriate. 3. In the war environment of the past ten years, our agricultural tax has mainly been collected in grain, which was completely necessary and correct at the time. However, the collection costs are therefore also very high, generally accounting for about 1%. In areas with blocked transportation, it is particularly difficult to handle the collected grain. Now that prices have stabilized and the RMB has gradually flowed into rural areas, more cash can be collected while ensuring the collection of the required wheat. However, this is a very complex task that requires collecting in different areas and periods, and close cooperation with trade purchases, credit, placement, and cooperatives. For this important issue, farmers should be educated as early as possible to prepare early, and avoid temporary short-term raids to collect funds, which may cause the danger of low grain prices harming farmers.
    Strengthening the leadership of governments at all levels over the summer tax collection work is the key to doing the above work well. Last year's tax collection work achieved great results due to the attention and efforts of governments at all levels. But this year we cannot be complacent because of this. We must strengthen leadership, widely publicize and explain, and conscientiously implement policies in accordance with the above-mentioned key points of work and in light of local actual conditions, to strive for the victory of the summer tax collection work.

### 做好夏征工作

　　做好夏征工作
    农业税的夏征工作就要到来了。本月二十五日中央人民政府政务院颁布了《一九五一年夏季征收公粮工作的指示》。夏征虽不如秋征那样普遍，却也是关系到几万万农民和国家财政的一件大事。今年夏征工作，是在广大新区刚刚完成土地改革之后。这些地区的封建土地制度已经消灭了，农民再不用向地主交纳地租了，但他们在生产上仍有许多困难。许多土地在土地改革过程中带苗转移，使夏收和负担上产生了许多复杂问题。同时，在土地改革完成的地区，还要在夏收后开始征收土地证费。因此，今年夏征工作，是一个艰巨而复杂的任务。
    为了做好夏征工作，应当注意那些问题呢？
    第一，适当分配夏、秋征比例。去年许多地区做到了依率计征，但没有适当确定夏秋分征比例，以致发生“夏轻秋重”的缺点，造成农民秋季交纳的困难。今年除各地无例外地进行查田订产，严格依率计征而外，还必须适当确定夏秋分征比例。那么，确定夏季和秋季分征比例的原则是什么呢？一般说，应大体按照夏秋产量占全年总产量的比例来确定。比如，某地夏收秋收各占一半，那么，夏征大体应占全年应征额的一半。另一地区，夏收占全年产量三分之一，秋收占三分之二，那么，夏征大体应占全年应征额的三分之一。但某些地区夏收较少，广大农民赖此度荒，可以酌量减少征收额。某些地区，夏收较多，农民吃用有余，可以多征一些。至于同一地区内，个别户夏收比一般农户特少，也应当加以照顾，分别少征或不征，待秋收后按税法规定补征。未种夏季作物的田地（包括种棉和种植烟叶的土地），都应当在秋季一次征收，以免除农民对种植棉花和烟叶等经济作物的顾虑。
    在刚刚完成土地改革的地区，今年夏征中还有一个重要问题，就是因为青苗地的转移而引起的负担问题。在土地改革中分配土地时，已种下作物的青苗地或刚加工施肥的土地，可能不分给原来的佃户，这就需要根据“谁种、谁收、谁负担”和“保护劳动所得”的原则来处理，才不致造成农民中的纠纷，影响夏征工作。
    第二，做好入仓和照顾送粮群众的工作。夏季天热多雨，因此，做好夏征入仓工作，不是一件容易事。各级干部应在抗美援朝运动的基础上，深入动员农民交纳好粮，并认真检查粮质，特别要责成各乡（村）干部切实检查。县、区政府应当订出详细的送粮和收粮计划，做好一切组织上和物质上的准备，注意解决送粮人畜茶水、食宿、医疗等问题，以防止人畜伤亡。去年征收中，有的地区因急于转入土地改革，限令农民于短期内扫数送粮入仓，谷子未及晒干，水分过大；如要把水分降低到百分之十三安全标准，其差额等于公粮二十五万吨，这是多么惊人的损失。粮食过湿，容易霉烂生芽，损失更大。送粮人畜伤亡的现象，去年已较前大为减少，但若干省份仍有此类事件发生。这一缺点，希望在今年夏征中切实加以防止。
    第三，适当地确定征收物的种类。这里应当考虑到这样几个问题：一、为了保证国家所必需的粮食，今年夏征中应当在一切产麦区征收小麦，在不能征收小麦的地区，酌征一部现款、杂粮和经济作物。对存棉户可允许以棉花抵交夏季公粮，其比价不得低于政务院财政经济委员会关于今年棉粮比价的规定。经济作物的征收应由财政部门与贸易、合作部门订好合同，共同办理。二、有些地区，盛产蚕茧、春茶和果木，并且在夏季大量出售，对这些地区，可考虑酌征一部货币。三、在过去十余年的战争环境中，我们的农业税以征收粮食为主，这在当时是完全必要的，正确的。但是，征收经费因此也是很大的，一般占百分之一左右。在交通闭塞的地区，征收的粮食，处理尤感困难。现在物价已经稳定，人民币已逐步流入农村，在保证征收所需的小麦的原则下，可多征一些现款。但是这是一件十分复杂的工作，需要分区分期征收，并与贸易收购、信贷、投放及合作社等密切配合。对于这个重要问题，应当及早对农民进行宣传，使他们早作准备，切忌临时短期突击征款，造成粮贱伤农的危险。
    各级人民政府对夏征工作加强领导，是做好上述工作的关键。去年的征收工作由于各级人民政府的重视和努力，曾获得伟大的成绩。但今年不能因此而稍有自满。必须根据上述的工作要点，结合当地实际情况，加强领导，广泛宣传解释，认真贯彻政策，以争取夏征工作的胜利。
