　　Xinhua News Agency Important Correction
    There were five errors and omissions in the translated version of the news release "Soviet Government's Opinion on the Draft of the U.S.-Japan Peace Treaty" on the 25th. Corrections are as follows:
    (1) The title of the opinion, "Soviet Union regarding the United States..." should be "Soviet Government regarding the United States..."
    (2) In item (1), paragraph 1, "and must be a joint matter for all these countries," should be "and must be a joint matter for all these countries' governments."
    (3) In item (1), paragraph 3, "and suffered huge losses due to Japanese aggression," "huge" is a mistake for "greatest."
    (4) In item (2), paragraph 16, the first sentence, "The Soviet government has always insisted on concluding a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible" is missing the symbol "(3)" at the beginning. Please add it.
    (5) In the last sentence: "A copy of the aforementioned document has also been sent to... the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" please add the words "of the government." after it. (This draft was published on the first page of this newspaper on May 25)

　　新华社重要更正
    二十五日新闻稿“苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书”译文有五处错漏，兹补正如下：
    （１）意见书标题“苏联关于美国……”应为“苏联政府关于美国……”。
    （２）第（一）项第一段，“而必须是所有这些国家共同的事情，”，应为“而必须是所有这些国家政府共同的事情，”。
    （３）第（一）项第三段，“并因日本的侵略而受到巨大的损失”，“巨大”为“最大”之误。
    （４）第（二）项第十六段，第一句“苏联政府曾经始终坚持尽速缔结对日和约”上端遗漏（三）字样，请补入。
    （５）最末一句：“上述文件的副本已同时送交……朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”之后请补入“的政府。”字样。（此稿刊于五月二十五日本报第一版）
