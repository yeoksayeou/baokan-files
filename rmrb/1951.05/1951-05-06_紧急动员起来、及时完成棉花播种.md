　　Urgent Mobilization to Complete Cotton Sowing on Time
    Today is the Beginning of Summer (Lixia), the most critical season for cotton sowing and the decisive moment for completing this year's task of expanding cotton fields. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued an urgent directive on May 1st, calling on governments at all levels to strengthen cotton sowing work. Leading organs at all levels and the masses in cotton-growing areas must attach great importance to this call and act more vigorously to ensure that the cotton planting task is completed as planned. Areas with better conditions should strive to exceed the original plan.
    As we all know, whether this year's cotton production task can be completed is closely related to the textile industry's production and the country's trade plans, and therefore will affect the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and the lives of the broad masses of workers and peasants to a considerable extent. For this reason, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in its "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951" promulgated on February 2nd, particularly emphasized the importance of increasing cotton production, and successively promulgated a series of decrees to reward cotton planting. Leading organs at all levels have generally attached great importance to cotton planting work this year, and have made various necessary arrangements and measures, such as providing fertilizer loans, adjusting seeds, and providing technical guidance. Many provinces have not only convened a series of mobilization and deployment conferences and organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to promote cotton planting, but also many provincial governors and secretaries of the provincial Party committees have personally gone deep into the rural areas to inspect and assist cotton planting work. At present, cotton planting work in some areas has entered a hot stage and has been completed according to plan. However, judging from the current situation, many problems still exist in some areas. In some places, the cotton planting plan has not been fully implemented to each household; in some places, the publicity and explanation of the policy of rewarding cotton planting is still not thorough, and the concerns of farmers about cotton planting have not been completely dispelled; and in some areas, the specific preparatory work for cotton planting is still not sufficient. In the North China cotton area, the lack of rain is currently very serious, making it difficult to sow cotton. In the Yangtze River basin cotton area, there is too much rain and the ground is cold, making it difficult for cotton to grow. All these are major obstacles to completing the cotton planting plan. All localities must act very vigorously to overcome these difficulties, otherwise it will cause immeasurable losses. In order to complete the urgent cotton planting task, what issues should be paid attention to?
    (1) The cotton planting plan and the policy of rewarding cotton planting should be further implemented to the village and to each household. We cannot be satisfied with general calls and arrangements, nor can we be satisfied with the enthusiasm and over-planned completion figures of advanced villages and advanced masses. We must see the cotton planting situation of general villages and general masses, especially backward villages and backward masses. This year's actual cotton planting area should strive to exceed the plan, not decrease.
    (2) We must further strengthen the specific organizational work of cotton planting. In areas where land reform has been completed not long ago, more attention should be paid to this. All rural work cadres and economic departments related to cotton planting work must do a good job in the specific organizational work of cotton planting, such as how to allocate labor after water management and rush planting of cotton conflict; how to organize substitute farming for the cotton fields of military families and revolutionary martyrs; how to remedy the lack of labor and livestock power; how to solve the planting difficulties of cotton farmers who lack means of production and means of subsistence; and how to conclude pre-purchase contracts.
    (3) We must repeatedly conduct in-depth inspections. Only repeated and in-depth inspections can continuously discover and solve problems. Any organization that adopts a blindly optimistic attitude towards the cotton planting task will inevitably cause serious errors. Leading organs in all localities that have not yet conducted an in-depth inspection of cotton planting work must immediately conduct another inspection of sowing work in order to correct shortcomings in the work in a timely manner and strive for all areas and villages that have the possibility of completing the plan but have not yet completed the plan to complete the plan during the sowing season.
    (4) In all rain-deficient areas, we must resolutely carry out drought-resistant sowing. Even if it does not rain, we must have the determination to rely on human power to complete the cotton planting plan. Historical facts of drought resistance have proved that man can conquer nature. We must overcome the idea of relying on the sky for rain. Of course, drought-resistant sowing is a very arduous and heavy organizational work, so we must overcome the fear of difficulties of the backward masses and the retreatist emotions of some cadres. Party members and League members in all rain-deficient cotton areas should act as backbones in drought-resistant work, unite activists, extensively mobilize the peasant masses, organize various forms of mutual aid organizations, and launch a vigorous drought-resistant spot sowing campaign. Existing water sources should be used very sparingly, and new water sources should be developed as much as possible.
    (5) Ensuring that cotton seedlings emerge completely is the foundation for striving for a bumper cotton harvest. A farmer's saying goes, "Seeing seedlings is half the harvest," or "Seeing seedlings is three-tenths of the harvest." Therefore, after sowing, we should pay attention to protecting the growth of cotton seedlings and prevent disasters such as diseases and insects in a timely manner. In the southern region, we must pay attention to attracting and killing cutworms to protect seedlings. In general cotton areas, we must pay attention to loosening the soil after rain to ensure that cotton seedlings emerge smoothly. If seedling shortages occur, those who have the conditions should immediately transplant and replant. If there is a drought, we must vigorously mobilize and organize irrigation of seedlings and prevent the occurrence of diseases and insect pests as early as possible. In order to do this work well, all agricultural technology institutions and technicians must go deep into the rural areas to help the masses, and all rural technical committees and technical groups must take protecting the smooth growth of cotton seedlings as the central task.
    The time is very urgent, let us urgently mobilize to strive for the over-fulfillment of the cotton planting task, so as to lay the foundation for a bumper cotton harvest.

### 紧急动员起来、及时完成棉花播种

　　紧急动员起来、及时完成棉花播种
    今日立夏，已是棉花播种最紧要的季节，也是今年扩大棉田任务能否完成的决定关头。政务院财政经济委员会已于五月一日发出紧急指示，号召各级人民政府加强棉花播种工作。各级领导机关和棉区群众必须十分重视这一号召，应更加紧张地行动起来，争取植棉任务能如计划完成。条件较好的地区，应争取超过原定计划。
    众所周知，今年棉花生产任务能否完成，密切关系到纺织工业生产和国家的贸易计划，因而在相当广泛程度上，将影响城乡物资交流，和广大工人农民群众的生活。为了这个原因，中央人民政府政务院在二月二日所颁发的“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中，特别强调了棉花增产的重要性，并接连颁布了一连串的奖励植棉的法令。各级领导机关今年对植棉工作一般也非常重视，作了种种必要的布置和措施，诸如举办肥贷，调剂种籽，技术指导等。许多省不仅召开了一系列的动员布置大会，组织了大批干部下乡推动植棉，且有不少的省政府主席，中共省委书记，都亲自深入农村检查和帮助植棉工作。现在，有些地区植棉工作已进入热潮，而且已按计划完成。但就目前情况看来，有些地区仍然存在着许多问题的。有些地方的植棉计划尚未完全贯彻到户；有些地方对于奖励植棉政策的宣传解释，还很不深入，农民对植棉的顾虑尚未完全解除；有些地区的植棉的具体准备工作，还作得很不够。在华北棉区，目前缺雨现象甚为严重，使棉花不易下种。在长江流域棉区，则雨多地寒，棉花不易生长。所有这些，都是完成植棉计划的重大障碍。各地必须很紧张地行动起来，克服这些困难，否则将造成不可计量的损失。为了完成紧迫的植棉任务，应当注意什么问题呢？
    （一）植棉计划及奖励植棉的政策进一步贯彻到村，贯彻到户。不能满足于一般的号召和布置，不能满足于先进村庄、先进群众的热烈情绪和超计划完成任务的数字，必须看到一般村庄和一般群众，特别是落后的村庄和落后群众的植棉状况。今年的实际植棉面积应力求超过计划，不能减少。
    （二）必须进一步加强植棉的具体组织工作。在土地改革完成不久的地区，更应对此加以注意。一切农村工作干部和有关植棉工作的经济部门必须把植棉的具体组织工作作好，诸如治水与突击种棉发生矛盾后，劳动力如何调配；军工烈属的棉田如何组织代耕；劳畜力缺乏时如何补救；生产资料和生活资料缺乏的棉农如何解决播种困难；预购合同如何订立等，均须有切实可行的办法。
    （三）必须反复地进行深入的检查。只有反复的深入检查才能不断发现问题和解决问题。任何对于植棉任务采取盲目乐观态度的，必致造成严重错误。各地领导机关凡尚未深入检查植棉工作的，必须立即再作一次播种工作的检查，以便及时纠正工作中的缺点，争取一切有可能完成计划而尚未完成计划的地区及村庄，在还能播种的季节内完成计划。
    （四）在一切缺雨地区必须坚决进行抗旱播种。即使天不下雨，也要有依靠人力完成植棉计划的决心。过去抗旱的历史事实证明，人是能够胜天的。必须克服靠天等雨的思想。当然，抗旱播种是一个十分艰苦繁重的组织工作，因此就必须克服落后群众的畏难思想，和某些干部的退却情绪。一切缺雨棉区的党员和团员应在抗旱工作中作骨干，团结积极分子，广泛地发动农民群众，组织各种形式的互助组织，掀起轰轰烈烈的抗旱点播运动。现有各种水源，应十分节约使用，并尽量开辟新的水源。
    （五）保证棉苗出齐是争取棉花丰收的基础。农谚说：“见苗一半收”，或“见苗三分收”。因此，播种之后要注意保护棉苗生长，及时防止病虫等灾害。南方地区必须注意诱杀地老虎，以保护幼苗。一般棉区都须注意雨后松土，保证棉苗顺利出土，缺苗情况一旦发生，条件许可者应立即进行移补。如遇天旱则须大力发动组织浇苗，并及早预防病虫害的发生。为使这一工作做好，一切农业技术机构，技术人员，必须深入农村，帮助群众，一切农村技术委员会，技术小组，必须以保护棉苗顺利生长为中心任务。
    时机已经十分紧迫，紧急动员起来，争取植棉任务的超额完成，以奠定棉花的丰收基础。
