The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is divided into three stages. The first stage was from early November to the end of December last year. This stage was the key development phase of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

At the beginning of the movement, current affairs studies were universally carried out among cadres, and each region established a regular reporting system for current affairs studies. Each banner and county trained more than 4,000 propagandists through cadre current affairs studies or short-term training courses. In November, Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda weeks were launched in various places. Representative meetings of folk artists were convened to promote various propaganda tools. Through newspapers, printing various propaganda materials, broadcasting, various meetings, launching comfort letter writing, volunteer registration, etc., Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda was carried out. At the end of November and the beginning of December, the movement gradually developed towards the countryside. Combined with grain requisitioning, winter studies, sideline production, and other work, as well as people's congresses, party congresses, and various meetings, Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movements were launched.

The focus of Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education in this stage was why the expansion of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea could not be ignored. After vigorous propaganda, the majority of the masses understood that striking at U.S. imperialism was precisely protecting the home and defending the country, and was an effective way to strive for world peace. Therefore, the panicked emotions of a small number of the masses were stabilized, the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to invade China and the essence of the paper tiger were exposed, and some fear of the U.S. mentality was eliminated.

The second stage, from January to the end of March this year, was a stage of large-scale movement from cities to forest areas, rural areas, and grasslands. The main focus of this stage was the large-scale Spring Festival cultural and recreational propaganda activities and the development of comfort and relief work. During the Spring Festival, under the unified plan of the Inner Mongolia Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, this movement was vigorously carried out in various leagues, banners, counties, forest areas, rural areas, and nomadic areas. In the Jirem League, a total of 337 amateur drama troupes were organized, accounting for 37% of the total number of administrative villages, performing 4,552 times, rehearsing more than 70 programs, and attracting an audience of 432,000 people. Secondly, folk artists were trained. A total of 400 people in the league were trained one to five times, mainly in ballad singing. More than 15,020 propagandas were conducted, with an audience of more than 120,000. In Tongliao city, 100 propagandists launched activities, each conducting three to five propagandas, with an estimated 32,000 people hearing the propaganda. The Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe and the Ministry of Public Security Propaganda Team carried out Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities in Tongliao, Horqin Left Rear Banner, and Horqin Left Middle Banner, with an audience of 60,000 people. Thirty-nine reporters from the entire league have reported 120 times in the past six months, with an audience of 51,840 people. Horqin Right Front Banner, Hinggan League, organized 31 amateur drama troupes, and Ulan Hot City organized four large Yangko teams, performing 16 shows with an audience of more than 25,000 people. In the Chahar League, each banner organized small propaganda teams at the Zuo (牧业区基层组织, a basic level organization in pastoral areas) level, with cadres from the banner and Zuo, members of the Youth League, primary school teachers, students, and folk artists as the backbone, and absorbing active elements from the masses. Each Zuo set up a propaganda station for every ten households (basic-level organization in pastoral areas) to conduct propaganda. In Zhengbai Xiangbai Joint Banner, 3,678 people received Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education, accounting for more than 50% of the banner's population. Among them, in Fourth Zuo, the entire Zuo had 970 people, and 802 people received Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education, accounting for more than 90% of the Zuo's population. In Hailar City, Hulunbuir League, about 250 large and small mass meetings were held during the Spring Festival, and more than 14,000 people were educated, accounting for about one-half of the city's population.

During this stage, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the Inner Mongolia region rapidly grew. The unprecedentedly extensive propaganda and artistic activities in various places, combined with central work, as well as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and opposition to U.S. imperialism arming Japan, etc., spread from cities to forest areas, rural areas, and grasslands, so that about 50% of the people in the entire region received a certain degree of Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education. Lamas, the elderly, and old ladies who usually did not care much about politics were also swept into this tide. Nineteen lama representatives from Hinggan, Hulunbuir, Xilin Gol, and Chahar Leagues were convened by the Inner Mongolia Resist America, Aid Korea Branch and held an Inner Mongolia Lama Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Meeting in March, expressing the patriotic enthusiasm of the lamas in Inner Mongolia and establishing a patriotic pact. This was a good start for the Inner Mongolia lama community to participate in the patriotic movement. It has a significant effect on popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the nomadic areas of Inner Mongolia.

This stage has two major gains. First: the awareness of cadres and the broad masses of the people has been raised a step further, and some thoughts of complacency, paralysis, and blind optimism have been corrected. In many places, the masses assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and exposing the rumors of bandits and secret agents. It aroused views of hatred, contempt, and disdain for U.S. imperialism, strengthened the spirit of internationalism and patriotism, established national self-esteem and self-confidence, and promoted the production movement and various tasks.

Second: It is reflected in the enthusiastic donations to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and provide relief to Korean refugees. According to the Jirem League's report, people from all walks of life in the league have donated approximately RMB 600 million in cash and 5,700 dan of grain. Currently, according to incomplete statistics in the entire region, the cash figure is RMB 1,091,460,000, 7,022 dan of grain, more than 10,000 comfort bags, and a large number of other items.

The third stage, from April 1 to the present, is a stage of popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement.

In April, the focus of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was to mobilize the broad masses of the people in Inner Mongolia to participate in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact, to hold voting on the peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue, and to prepare for the "May 1st" grand demonstration to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government. The Resist America, Aid Korea branches of various leagues, banners (counties), and cities, and the major mass organizations in Inner Mongolia, have all formulated plans for popularizing and deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea, and are actively taking action. For example, in the first village of Chengguan District, Huade County, 227 out of 263 people signed and voted (elementary school students and the 36 people participating in work signed separately and are not included, totaling 100 percent). In the second village, 345 out of 360 people participated in signing and voting.

　　内蒙古抗美援朝运动有进一步的开展
         胡昭衡
    内蒙古自治区的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，共分三个阶段。第一个阶段是从去年十一月初至十二月底，这一阶段为抗美援朝运动有重点的开展阶段。
    运动开始时，首先在干部中普遍进行了时事学习，各地区都建立了时事学习定期报告制度。各旗县都经过干部时事学习或短期训练班，训练了四千多名宣传员；十一月间先后在各地展开了抗美援朝宣传周；召开民间艺人代表会议，推动各种宣传工具，通过报刊、印发各种宣传材料、广播、各种会议、发动写慰劳信、志愿报名等，进行了抗美援朝宣传。于十一月末、十二月初运动逐步向农村发展。结合征粮、冬学、副业生产等工作，及人代会、党代会，各种会议展开了抗美援朝爱国运动。
    这一阶段的抗美援朝爱国主义教育，中心是为什么对美帝国主义扩大侵朝战争不能置之不理。经过大力宣传后，大部分群众懂得了打击美国帝国主义正是保家卫国，是争取世界和平的有效办法，因此，稳定了少数群众的慌乱情绪，揭穿了美帝国主义侵略中国的阴谋和纸老虎的本质，一部分恐美心理被扫除了。
    第二阶段自今年一月至三月底，是运动由城市向林区、农村、草地大规模开展的阶段。这一阶段中主要是规模宏大的春节文娱宣传活动和慰问救济工作的开展。春节期间，在内蒙抗美援朝分会统一计划下，在各盟、旗、县、林区、农村、游牧地区大力开展了这一运动。在哲里木盟共组织三百三十七个业余剧团，占行政村总数百分之三十七，演出四、五五二次，排演节目七十余种，观众人数四十三万两千余人。其次训练了民间艺人，全盟共四百名，训练一次到五次，主要是说大鼓书。宣传过一万五千零二十次，听众达十二万多。通辽城内有一百名宣传员展开活动，每人进行了三次至五次的宣传，听到宣传的约计有三万二千人左右。内蒙文工团和公安部宣传队，在通辽、科左后旗、科左中旗开展春节文娱活动，观众六万人。全盟三十九名报告员，半年来报告过一百二十次，听众五万一千八百四十名。兴安盟扎赉特旗组织了三十一个业余剧团，乌兰浩特市组织了四个大秧歌队，演出十六场，观众达二万五千多人。察哈尔盟各旗以佐的单位组织了小型宣传队，由旗佐干部、青年团员、小学教员、学生、民间艺人为骨干吸收了群众中的积极分子，每佐以十户（牧业区基层组织）为单位设立了宣传站进行了宣传。正白厢白联合旗有三千六百七十八人受到抗美援朝爱国教育，占全旗人口百分之五十以上，其中四佐，全佐九百七十余人，受到抗美援朝爱国教育的人就有八百零二人，占全佐人口百分之九十以上。呼纳盟海拉尔市在春节期间举行大小群众会议约二百五十次，受到教育的人有一万四千多人，约及全市人口二分之一。
    这一阶段中，内蒙地区抗美援朝运动迅速壮大，各地空前广泛的宣传活动和文艺活动，结合中心工作以及镇压反革命活动和反对美帝国主义武装日本等，从城市普及到林区、农村、草地，使全区约有百分之五十的人民群众受到一定程度的抗美援朝爱国教育。平时不大关心政治的喇嘛、老年人、老太太也都卷入了这一浪潮。兴安、呼纳、锡林郭勒、察哈尔盟的喇嘛代表十九人，由内蒙抗美援朝分会召集，在三月间举行了内蒙喇嘛抗美援朝代表会议，表示内蒙喇嘛的爱国热忱，订立了爱国公约。这是内蒙喇嘛界参加爱国运动的良好开端。对于内蒙在游牧区普及深入抗美援朝运动有着重大的作用。
    这一阶段有两大收获，第一：使干部和广大人民群众的觉悟提高了一步，一部分太平麻痹与盲目乐观的思想情绪，已经得到纠正，许多地方的群众协助政府镇压反革命，揭发土匪特务的谣言。激起了对美帝国主义的仇视、蔑视、鄙视的观点，加强了国际主义与爱国主义的精神，树立了民族自尊心和自信心，推动了生产运动和各项工作。
    第二：表现在慰劳中国人民志愿军救济朝鲜难民的踊跃捐献上，据哲里木盟报告，该盟各界人民已捐出现金人民币六亿左右，粮食达五千七百石，目前全区据不完全的统计，现金数字人民币十亿九千一百四十六万元，粮食七千零二十二石，慰问袋一万余个以及其他大批物品。
    第三阶段自四月一日到现在，是普及深入抗美援朝爱国运动的阶段。
    在四月份，抗美援朝运动的中心是发动内蒙广大人民群众参加拥护缔结和平公约的签名，举行对和平解决日本问题的投票，准备进行“五一”大示威，庆祝自治区人民政府成立四周年纪念。各盟、旗（县）、市的抗美援朝分会，内蒙各大群众团体都订出了普及深入抗美援朝的计划，并且积极行动起来。如化德县城关区第一村二百六十三人中有二百二十七人签名投票（小学生和参加工作的三十六人另行签名未计入，合计起来作到百分之百），第二村三百六十人中即有三百四十五人，参加了签名投票。
