　　The Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Bureau Convenes National Salt Production Conference
    The Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government convened a National Salt Production Conference in Beijing on April 11 to discuss how to strive to overfulfill this year's production tasks and the issue of implementing economic accounting systems in state-owned salt fields. The conference concluded on April 24.
    Based on the current situation of salt production and sales and the amount of salt in storage, the participating representatives unanimously agreed that ensuring the people's food supply and the state's salt tax revenue is not a problem. However, with the development of industry, agriculture, and fisheries, and the improvement of people's living standards, the sales of salt are continuously increasing. Therefore, this year, we must strive to achieve a large amount of overproduction in state-owned and concentrated privately-owned salt fields and farms where salt production is concentrated, transportation is convenient, costs are low, and quality is high.
    Based on the above situation, the conference determined that the production policy for state-owned salt fields and concentrated privately-owned salt fields should be to increase output, ensure quality, reduce costs, accumulate funds, and expand reproduction in a planned and step-by-step manner. This is the only way to improve production efficiency and fully utilize production capacity on the existing foundation. The conference decided that if state-owned salt fields need to expand operations, they should first make a plan, report it to the Salt Affairs Bureau for transfer to the Central Ministry of Finance for approval, and then increase investment when the situation is favorable and financial resources permit. For privately-owned salt flats, wells, and stoves with development potential, private investment should be encouraged, and they should be helped to improve their management methods.
    The conference also reviewed the spring drying work this year, believing that most salt fields have favorable conditions such as good beach construction, sufficient water storage, high salinity, sufficient supplies, and complete materials. Salt fields in various regions have also launched patriotic production competitions to resist America and aid Korea, so everyone is confident in completing this year's production tasks and estimates that they can overproduce millions of dan. However, based on past experience, to ensure the completion of production tasks, it is necessary to grasp the production situation during the peak production period, understand the reasons for overproduction and underproduction at any time, oppose blind optimism, and relax the struggle against nature. At the same time, attention should be paid to both quality and quantity, and the policy of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" should be correctly implemented.
    Secondly, according to the operation and management situation of state-owned salt fields in various regions, the conference believes that the preliminary conditions for implementing the economic accounting system have gradually been met. In order to strive to implement the economic accounting system in some or most salt fields next year, the conference decided: 1. Unify the detailed items of cost calculation. 2. Fix profits. 3. Seriously clean up assets and do a good job of re-evaluating assets. 4. Gradually change the unreasonable old wage system. 5. Gradually establish a responsibility system. 6. Study the issue of adjusting the organizational structure that does not conform to enterprise management after the spring drying. In addition, the conference also approved the method for state-owned salt industry profit submission and the method for depreciation fund withdrawal.

### 财政部盐务总局召开全国盐业生产会议

　　财政部盐务总局召开全国盐业生产会议
    中央人民政府财政部盐务总局于四月十一日在北京召开全国盐业生产会议，讨论如何争取超额完成今年的生产任务，以及国营盐场实行经济核算制的问题。会议已于四月二十四日结束。
    根据目前食盐产销情况和存盐数量，与会代表一致认为保证民食与国家盐税收入是不成问题的，但随着工、农、渔业的发展和人民生活的改善，盐的销路正在不断增加。因此今年必须在盐产集中、运输便利、成本低和质量高的国营盐场和民营盐场中争取做到大量的超额生产。
    根据上述情况，会议确定了国营盐场与集中的民营盐场的生产方针，应该是增加产量，保证质量，减低成本，积累资金，并有计划有步骤地扩大再生产。这样才能争取在现有基础上，提高生产效率，充分发挥生产能力。会议决定，国营盐场如须扩大经营，应在情况有利与财力许可下，首先作出计划，报经盐务总局转中央财政部批准后，再行增加投资。对有发展条件的民营盐滩、井、灶，应鼓励私人投资，并帮助他们改善经营方法。
    会议也检查了今年的春晒工作，认为一般盐场都具备了滩工好、蓄水足、卤度浓、物资够、材料全等有利条件，各地盐场并已展开了抗美援朝爱国生产竞赛运动，因此大家都有信心完成今年生产任务，并估计可以超额生产数百万担。但根据过去的经验，要保证生产任务的完成，必须在旺产时期掌握生产情况，随时了解多产少产原因，反对盲目乐观，放松与自然作斗争。同时要注意质量并重，和正确执行“公私兼顾、劳资两利”政策。
    其次，会议根据各地国营盐场经营管理情况，认为实行经济核算制的初步条件已逐渐具备。为了争取在明年部分盐场或大部分盐场实行经济核算制，会议决定：一、统一成本计算的细目。二、固定利润。三、认真清理资产，作好资产重新估价工作。四、逐渐改变不合理的旧工资制度。五、逐渐建立责任制。六、研究于春晒后进行调整不合企业化的组织机构问题。此外，会议还通过了国营盐业利润上缴办法及折旧基金提缴办法。
