　　We Should Examine Our Erroneous Thinking in Praising Wu Xun
    Zhao Xin
    I am a Communist Party member who once blindly praised Wu Xun. The main reason I praised him was that I was temporarily misled by Wu Xun's "miracle." Looking back now, this was very wrong. This can certainly be said to be due to my low level of political theory and weak analytical ability; but it should also be admitted that my old thinking was seriously present, to the point of losing my position, failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and praising the ugly Wu Xun. This error was only discovered after reading articles criticizing Wu Xun, and my understanding of Wu Xun underwent a fundamental transformation; I began to eliminate my confused views of Wu Xun and establish correct concepts. However, I know that this new understanding of mine is still superficial and abstract; my understanding of certain specific issues may still be biased. Therefore, I want to participate in the discussion about "The Life of Wu Xun" and continue to criticize my erroneous thinking. I agree with what is said in the article "Communist Party Members Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun'": "In all cities where 'The Life of Wu Xun' has been shown, the local Party organizations should systematically lead the discussion of 'The Life of Wu Xun' and regard leading this discussion as a serious ideological education task." Party organizations in various localities should quickly lead and organize this discussion, and should pay attention to collecting relevant materials for everyone to refer to during the discussion.

　　我们应检讨自己赞扬武训的错误思想
    赵欣
    我是一个曾经盲目赞扬武训的共产党员。我赞扬他的原因，主要是一时被武训的“奇迹”所迷惑。现在检讨起来，这是非常错误的。这当然可以说是我的政治理论水平太低，分析能力太弱；但也应承认，我的旧的思想严重地存在着，以致丧失立场，敌我不分，赞扬了丑恶的武训。这种错误，直到读了批判武训的文章后才发觉的，对武训的认识才有了根本的转变；开始消除了对武训的糊涂看法，树立了正确的观念。但是，我知道我这种新的认识还是肤浅的，抽象的；对某些具体问题的认识还是会有偏差的。因此我要参加关于《武训传》的讨论，继续批判我的错误思想。我同意《共产党员应当参加“武训传”的批判》一文中所说的：“凡放映过《武训传》的各城市，那里的党组织都要有计划地领导对《武训传》的讨论，要把领导这一讨论当作一个严重的思想教育工作。”各地党组织应迅速领导组织这一讨论，并应注意搜集有关材料，供大家在讨论中参考。
