To the Editor:

Mr. Ba Qi's comments in the "Letters to the Editor" column on March 22nd regarding our cooperative's "failure to complete the key allocation tasks for February" are very helpful to our future work. We now offer the following self-criticism regarding the reasons for our failure to complete the February allocation tasks:

One, insufficient preparation for "allocation": After the list of cooperatives approved to enjoy key allocation was announced on February 15th, the allocation methods were announced on the 16th, and the 21st to 25th were designated as the time for grassroots cooperatives to apply for purchases. Due to the short time, it was difficult for the grassroots cooperatives to conduct thorough and accurate surveys and statistics. This is the main reason why the allocation task could not be completed.

Two, because of insufficient preparation, the types and quantities of allocated goods could not fully meet the needs of cooperative members: Members wanted Yao salt, but what was allocated was Huai salt, and the quantity was too small. Members liked "fine granulated sugar," but what was allocated was "special granulated white sugar." Because members all wanted rice and did not want flour, only 6.9 percent of the allocated flour was sold.

Three, other objective reasons: Many employees' salaries for February were pre-paid during the Spring Festival, which weakened purchasing power at that time. Furthermore, in the case of the Seamen's Cooperative, because most of the members were not in Shanghai, the number of allocations made was even smaller.

Four, according to the final statistics, the actual allocation figure for our cooperative's key allocation in February was 72.93 percent of the original application figure, not "slightly more than 40 percent" (as Mr. Ba Qi stated in his original letter).

In order to further improve the allocation business, we should pay attention to the experiences and lessons of the February allocation work in the future and strive to do a good job in survey and statistics. We also hope that the broad masses of readers and cooperative members will often provide us with opinions.

### 上海市合作社对二月份配售工作未完成任务的检讨

　　上海市合作社对二月份配售工作未完成任务的检讨编辑同志：
    三月二十二日巴祈先生在《读者来信》栏对本社“未完成二月份重点配售任务”提出的意见，对我们今后的工作有很多帮助。现在我们将二月份配售工作所以没有完成任务的原因检讨如下：
    一、“配售”的准备工作做得不够：二月十五日公布核准可以享受重点配售的合作社名单后，十六日接着公布配售办法，并规定二十一日至二十五日为基层社申请购物时间，由于时间的短促，基层社的调查统计便很难深入和精确。这是配售任务不能完成的主要原因。
    二、因为准备工作不够，所以配售品的种类和数量就不能完全符合社员的需要：社员要姚盐，配售的却是淮盐，并且数量也太少。社员欢喜“绵白糖”，配售的是“特砂白糖”。因为社员们都要大米，不愿意要面，结果面粉只卖出了配售量的百分之六点九。
    三、其他的客观原因：二月份的职工薪金，很多人都在春节时预支了，因此减弱了当时的购买力。再如海员合作社，因社员多半不在上海，配售出去的数字就更小。
    四、本社二月份重点配售的实配数字，据最后统计：实占原申请数字的百分之七十二点九三，不是百分之四十强（巴祈先生的原信说是百分之四十强）。
    为了进一步搞好配售业务，我们今后应重视二月份配售工作的经验教训，努力做好调查统计工作。并希望广大的读者及社员群众们经常对我们提供意见。
