A Shoddily Made Map - Shi Dehan's Compiled "Latest Chinese Geographic Map"
Published by Zhenqiu Cartography Society, February 1951 First Edition

The "Latest Chinese Geographic Map," published by Shanghai Zhenqiu Cartography Society in February of this year, bears the subtitle "Suitable for Junior High, Senior High, and Elementary Schools." The preface, titled "Editor's Note," states that "this map is compiled based on actual survey maps from major administrative regions, administrative offices, provinces, and cities, specifically for teaching purposes in junior high, senior high, and elementary schools." In reality, the map's cartography is crude, and the accompanying text explanations are riddled with errors, some of which are bizarre and inexplicable. It is the worst of the various domestic geographic atlases published in recent years. I will now highlight a few significant points to illustrate this.

A. Political Errors

	(1) Significant discrimination against domestic minority ethnic groups is evident, fully demonstrating Han chauvinistic viewpoints. For example, page 26 states: "Lolo, Laliao, commonly known as Manzi," and "Miao and Man barbarians have strong temperaments and often engage in械斗 (xie dou - armed fights) with the Han people." Page 28 states, "Miao and Man barbarians are fierce and cruel." Page 29 states that Guizhou Province "was the lair of Miao and Man barbarians in ancient times... The word 'Gui' (贵 - Guizhou) is a phonetic shift of the word 'Gui' (鬼 - ghost)." (2) On page 6, when listing the virtues of the citizens of the capital, it includes "rich in obedience." This not only obliterates the history of the capital's citizens' repeated resistance struggles against evil forces since the May Fourth Movement but also reveals that the editor's consciousness still regards slavish obedience and docility as virtues, failing to understand the significance of the people standing up to be masters. (3) "South Korea" is the name given by the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet regime, but this book states on page 12, when describing Liaodong Province, that "the Yalu River is the natural boundary water between China and Korea" and that "Andong City faces Sinuiju, Korea, across the river." Both instances use "South Korea" to represent Korea. This error is, of course, merely a result of carelessness during compilation, but it also shows that the compiler lacks sufficient knowledge of international politics, leading to the unconscious inclusion of such confusing and enemy-friendly wording.

B. Factual Errors

	(1) The area of Shenyang City is over 3,000 square kilometers, but page 12 of this book mistakenly states it as 31,517 square kilometers, approximately ten times the actual size. The area of Fushun City is over 90 square kilometers, with a population of over 230,000; the same page mistakenly states it as 912 square kilometers, with a population of over 23,900, the former being ten times the actual size, and the latter being one-tenth. The area of Benxi City is over 30 square kilometers, with a population of over 90,000; the same page mistakenly states it as 349 square kilometers, with a population of over 9,600, the former also being ten times the actual size, and the latter also being one-tenth. Some of these numbers are underestimated, while others are overestimated, with bizarre errors. (2) Lin Sen County in Fujian, which is the former Minhou County sharing the same city with Fuzhou, is located in the lower reaches of the Min River and has recently been abolished. However, under the "Important Cities" section of Fujian Province on page 18, it still lists "Lin Sen" and states that it is "in the upper reaches of the Min River, where the Lin Sen Special District Office is located." Does this mean that the compiler simply did not know where the former "Lin Sen County" was located? Therefore, it cannot be found on the map. (3) On page 12, it states that Dalian City "governs Dalian and Lushun cities and Dalian, Jin County, and Changshan three counties," listing Dalian and Lushun together, which is already incorrect; further down, it states, "Dalian City is Dalian County," which is even more incomprehensible. Also, on page 21, it states: "Hankou is located at the mouth of the Han River into the sea, looking south to Wuhan... and was liberated at the same time as Wuhan. Hanyang... faces Snake Hill of Wuhan." Here, "Han River into the sea" is obviously a mistake for "into the Yangtze River"; however, listing Wuhan alongside Hankou and Hanyang is also incomprehensible.

C. Proofreading Errors

	There are numerous misprinted characters in the map due to careless proofreading, to the point that the meaning of many sentences is altered. For example, "Nanyang" on the first page is misprinted as "Nanyang" (南洋 - Southeast Asia). "Dalian" on page 12 is misprinted as "Datong". Page 26 states that western Xikang has "many large mountain ruins," where "large" (大 - da) is a misprint for "fire" (火 - huo). The "Da Shan Mountains" in central Xinjiang on page 32 is a misprint for "Tian Shan Mountains" (天山 - Tian Shan).

From the few examples cited above, it is clear that the errors in the map's textual explanations are extremely serious. I suggest that the publishing house cease selling this map and expedite its revision to avoid misleading readers.

### 一本粗制滥造的地图  时德涵编纂《最新中国地理图》

　　一本粗制滥造的地图  时德涵编纂《最新中国地理图》
    震球舆地社一九五一年二月初版
    上海震球舆地社本年二月出版的《最新中国地理图》，书名前题“初中高小适用”，首页《编者的话》中有“本图根据各大行政区各行署各省市实测地图参考编制，专供初中高小教学之用”等话，实际上这本地图绘制既不高明，每幅图后附加的文字说明更是谬误百出，而且有些地方错误得离奇难解，在近年出版的各种本国地理图说中是最差的一种。现在举出其中显著的几条以见一斑。
  甲、政治上的错误
    （一）对于国内少数兄弟民族的歧视非常显著，充分表现了大汉族主义的观点；如在第二十六页中说：“猡猡，獠獠，俗名蛮子”，“苗蛮气质强悍，常和汉族械斗”。在二十八页中说“苗蛮凶悍残忍”。二十九页中说贵州省“古时是苗蛮的窟宅，………贵字就是鬼字的转音”。（二）在第六页中列举首都市民的美风，有“富于服从性”一项，这不但抹煞了首都各界市民从“五四”以来对恶势力多次反抗斗争的历史，而且表现出编者意识中还是以奴隶式的服从驯顺为美德，而不了解人民翻身作主人的意义。（三）“韩国”是南朝鲜李承晚伪政权所定的国名，但本书在第十二页叙述辽东省时，说“鸭绿江是中韩天然界水”，又说“安东市与韩之新义州隔江相望”。都以“韩国”来代表朝鲜。这种错误固然只是编写时的疏忽所致；但也足见编写者对于国际政治缺乏足够的常识，以致在不知不觉中写出了这样混淆敌友的错误字句。
  乙、材料上的错误
    （一）沈阳市的面积是三千多方公里，本书第十二页误为三万一千五百十七方公里，约为原数的十倍。抚顺市的面积是九十多方公里，人口二十三万多；同页误为九百十二方公里，人口二万三千九百余，前者为原数的十倍，后者为十分之一。本溪市的面积是三十多方公里，人口九万多；同页误为三百四十九方公里，人口九千六百余，前者也为原数的十倍，后者也为十分之一。这些数字有的以多为少，有的又以少为多，错误得十分离奇。（二）福建林森县即是旧日与福州市同城的闽侯县，位在闽江下游，最近业已撤消；本书第十八页福建省“重要城市”子目下边却仍有“林森”，并说它“在闽江上游，林森专区专署驻此”。这是不是编写者根本不晓得旧日的“林森县”是在哪里呢？因此在地图上也就找不到它了。（三）在第十二页说旅大市“辖旅大、旅顺二市及大连、金县、长山三个县”，将旅大和旅顺并列，已经不合；下面又说“旅大市即大连县”，更不可解。又在第二十一页说：“汉口当汉水入海之口，南望武汉，……与武汉市同时解放。汉阳……与武汉蛇山对峙。”这里“汉水入海”当然是“入江”之误；但又将武汉与汉口、汉阳并列，也是不可解的。
  丙、校勘上的错误
    图中因校勘疏忽而排错的字非常之多，以至有不少地方的语句改变了原意。如第一页中将“南阳”误排作“南洋”。第十二页中将“大连”误排作“大通”。第二十六页说西康“西部多大山遗址”，“大”字乃是“火”字之误。第三十二页新疆中部的“大山山脉”又是“天山山脉”之误。
    从以上所举少数的例子，已足见本书图说部分的错误是非常严重的。我建议该社将本图停止发售，并从速改编，以免贻误读者。
