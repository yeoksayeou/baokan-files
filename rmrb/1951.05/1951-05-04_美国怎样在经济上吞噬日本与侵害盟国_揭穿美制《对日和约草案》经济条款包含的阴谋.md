　　How the United States Economically Devours Japan and Infringes on Allied Nations
    —Exposing the Conspiracy Contained in the U.S.-Made Draft of the Treaty of Peace with Japan’s Economic Provisions—
         Lin Tianmo
    The absurd U.S.-made "Draft of the Treaty of Peace with Japan" not only reveals the intention to swallow Japan whole in one gulp, but also attempts to encompass the legitimate rights and interests of the Allied nations to satisfy selfish desires. No matter how Dulles flaunts his writing skills in the "Draft," attempting to deceive himself and others, he cannot conceal the ambition of American imperialism to enslave Japan and expand its aggression.
    In the economic provisions, Dulles's manipulation of the wording is even more pronounced. At first glance, it seems very generous to Japan and very fair to the Allied nations; but upon closer inspection, you will discover the glint of knives and the smell of blood.
    Chapter Five, Article Thirteen of the "Draft" is the central article of the economic provisions, so let's analyze this article.
    This article stipulates the economic relationship between Japan and the Allied nations after the "Treaty" is concluded, mainly: (1) "Japan declares that it is prepared to promptly conclude treaties or agreements with the Allied nations to establish mutual commercial and trade relations on a solid and friendly basis." (2) "The Japanese government shall, within three years after this treaty comes into effect, grant to each Allied nation most-favored-nation treatment in terms of tariffs, taxes, and all other regulations applicable to imports and exports and related to imports and exports." And "Japan may refuse to grant preferential treatment to any country if that country requires Japan to grant higher preferential treatment than that which it grants to Japan, except for the usual reservations in its commercial treaties." (3) "The Japanese government shall simultaneously grant national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment to Allied ships, nationals, companies, and their property, interests, and commercial activities in Japan, whichever is more favorable." Similarly, "Japan may refuse to grant preferential treatment to any country if that country requires Japan to grant higher preferential treatment than that which it grants to Japan, except for the usual reservations in its commercial treaties."
    In simple terms, after the "Treaty" is concluded, Japan must immediately conclude "friendly" treaties or agreements on commerce and trade with the Allied nations; how "friendly" should they be? The "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" "within three years after the Treaty comes into effect" are examples; and the "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" are "equal" for the Allied nations, while the relationship between Japan and the Allied nations is "reciprocal."
    What "fair" provisions!
    Dulles's writing skills are indeed quite clever. However, although the techniques are clever, the facts before us are too commonplace. As long as you close your eyes and think for a moment: under whose influence is Japan today? Who controls Japan's economy today? Then you will suddenly realize.
    For whom is it "equal" and for whom is it "preferential"? To put it bluntly, so-called equality is American monopoly, and so-called reciprocity is American exclusivity. Look at the facts:
    Everyone knows that the United States is a military occupying country in Japan, while Japan is an occupied country (at the same time as the treaty is concluded, the US and Japan will also sign a military agreement, and the US military will continue to be stationed in Japan); the United States is a "aid" country to Japan, while Japan is a "recipient" country; the United States is a creditor country, while Japan is a debtor country; the United States has great economic power, while Japan has small economic power. It is truly a strange thing to talk about economic "reciprocity" between two countries with such disparate positions. We only see a large influx of surplus American products into Japan, but we have not heard of Japanese goods occupying the American market; we only see American aid and American capital flowing into Japan and penetrating into various industrial fields in Japan, but we have not heard of Japanese people opening factories and setting up shops everywhere in the United States, and buying a lot of stocks. Obviously, who enjoys the "most-favored-nation treatment" "in terms of tariffs, taxes, and all other regulations applicable to imports and exports and related to imports and exports"? Who enjoys "national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment" for "ships, nationals, companies, and their property, interests, and commercial activities"? It is the United States in Japan, not Japan in the United States.
    Trade figures tell us that from Japan's surrender to 1950, the total value of goods imported by Japan from the United States was nearly 2.2 billion US dollars, while the value of goods exported by Japan to the United States was only about 400 million US dollars. Japan's trade deficit with the United States reached more than 1.7 billion US dollars, and Japan-US trade was completely one-sided. Moreover, many of the goods imported by Japan from the United States are dumping of surplus American goods and surplus materials. Some that could have been imported from neighboring Asian countries at low prices are forced to import surplus American products at high prices, such as food and coal. Tariffs and other measures related to imports and exports were originally a means for countries with economic disadvantages to defend against the intrusion of economically dominant countries and protect their own industry and commerce; now the United States requires Japan to give the United States "most-favored-nation treatment" "in terms of tariffs, taxes, and all other regulations applicable to imports and exports," with such a wide scope, this is equivalent to opening Japan's trade doors wide, allowing American goods to enter unimpeded, American bosses making big money, and Japanese national industries going bankrupt!
    The United States has long manipulated Japan's trade, and there are more recent examples. On March 31, the Japanese Parliament greatly revised the originally drafted import tax bill, reducing or exempting import taxes on many American goods, which was the result of pressure from the United States. America is supreme, and Japanese tariffs have actually become a tool to protect the dumping of American goods.
    The United States not only manipulates Japan's trade, but also controls the entire Japanese economy with US aid funds and various investment methods. US aid funds are nominally "aid," but in reality, they are promoting the sale of surplus American goods. This is a form of aid by importing materials. Regardless of whether Japan needs these materials or not, or whether the prices are appropriate or not, Japan must accept them. Among the nearly 2.2 billion US dollars worth of goods imported by Japan from the United States from after Japan's surrender to 1950 mentioned above, so-called US aid materials accounted for nearly 2 billion US dollars. Since 1949, a special accounting item called the "US Aid Counterpart Fund" has been established under the name of US aid imported materials, that is, after the US aid materials are imported into Japan and converted into Japanese yen, they must be stored in a special account, a special account must be established, and they must be included in the national budget, and their use is completely controlled by the United States. The United States uses this to manipulate the entire Japanese economy, including finance, finance, production, and trade.
    In addition to controlling with "US aid funds," the United States also enters various Japanese production enterprises in the name of so-called private capital. American capital has established close relationships with many Japanese enterprises through investment, cooperation, and the purchase of stocks, especially in industries such as the petroleum industry, machinery industry, chemical industry, steel industry, shipbuilding industry, and electric power industry. For example, the American "Mobil Oil Company" has acquired 51% of the shares of the famous Japanese "Toa Fuel Company." The industries of the old Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda large Zaibatsu systems are also not without American capital.
    American banks, general companies, trading companies, and various trading houses are also established everywhere in Japan, doing business everywhere, and making huge profits. The reactionary Japanese government, on the orders of the United States, also established a special committee to welcome foreign investment, and formulated laws and regulations to protect and prefer foreign investment, such as allowing foreign-funded enterprises to remit their earned profits back to their home countries in foreign currencies, providing foreign-funded enterprises with the convenience of finding land and houses, and guaranteeing that no discriminatory treatment will be applied, etc. The so-called foreign investment is mainly American capital.
    Recently, economic figures from the United States and Japan have been frequently shuttling back and forth. Various industries in Japan are discussing with American capitalists ways to absorb American capital, and some have successively signed "investment cooperation" contracts. According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, the draft of the entire "US-Japan Economic Cooperation Plan" has also been completed. In his speech to Japanese business leaders in Osaka on April 21, Yoshida praised MacArthur for having "sincerely advised" him: "Japan should enthusiastically cooperate with the United States to turn the Japanese economy into a part of the American economy." At the same time, Yoshida shamelessly "emphasized the importance of foreign investment, especially American investment, and urged that efforts must be made to guarantee large profits for investors." (April 22, AFP Tokyo) This means: The Japanese economy must serve to expand profits for American capitalists!
    From this, we can clearly understand the purpose of the US-made "Draft of the Treaty of Peace with Japan" stipulating that "the Japanese government shall simultaneously grant national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment to Allied ships, nationals, companies, and their property, interests, and commercial activities in Japan."
    The US-Japan "reciprocal" relationship is like this, so what is the status of other Allied nations? As mentioned above, the so-called "reciprocity" is American exclusivity, and the so-called "equality" is American monopoly.
    Taking trade as an example, from Japan's surrender to 1950, Japan's total import value was approximately 3.3 billion US dollars, of which the United States accounted for nearly 2.2 billion US dollars, nearly two-thirds; during the same period, Japan's total export value was approximately 1.8 billion US dollars, of which the United States accounted for approximately 400 million US dollars, accounting for slightly more than one-quarter; at the same time, Japan's total trade deficit was approximately 1.4 billion US dollars, but the trade deficit with the United States reached 1.7 billion US dollars, exceeding the total trade deficit. This shows that Japan's trade is in deficit with the United States, but in surplus with other countries combined. The United States is doing its utmost to help Japan export to other countries (of course, limited to not affecting the sales of American goods), in order to increase Japan's ability to import goods from the United States, and to exchange for military raw materials from other countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, to expand the United States' military industry in Japan. Among the goods exported by Japan to various countries, many also have American capital in them. American capitalists know that investing in production and sales in Japan is sometimes more profitable than in the United States. Japan's cheap labor has always been appreciated by American capitalists. The wages of workers in general enterprises in the United States are about ten times or more higher than those of Japanese workers, and the textile industry is 14 or 15 times higher.
    Obviously, Japan's economy and trade are under the control and manipulation of the United States. The so-called "reciprocity" and "equality" of "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" will not only not benefit the Allied nations, but will also suffer a great loss. Recently, US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Rusk, in his speech to the House Appropriations Committee, expressed the selfish intention of the United States to use Japan to expand its markets and plunder raw materials very bluntly. He said, "If Japan can allocate the raw materials it needs, and if it can obtain markets in Southeast Asia and South Asia, its situation will not require huge subsidies"; "The problem now is to find raw materials and markets for Japan's products." (April 25, United Press)
    Therefore, the so-called "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" are not only the ropes that bind Japan's economy, but also the ropes that the United States uses Japan to bind other Allied nations, especially Southeast Asian countries.
    Even Britain has felt uneasy and wailed about the United States' approach. The London Times warned: "Prevent Japan's new economic aggression" (April 23, United Press); the British "Economist" weekly pointed out: "The prospect of concluding a treaty of peace with Japan does not calm the nerves of British businessmen who fear increased market competition." (April 7, AFP) The chairman of the Bradford Dyers' Association in England, Ivan, worried: "Under the Western European standard of living, it is possible that no country can compete with Japan's production costs under existing conditions" (April 5, Associated Press). People in Pakistan also said: "For technical reasons, we oppose the clause in the American draft that gives Japan most-favored-nation treatment," it is said that "the Pakistani government believes that if this clause is retained, the signatory countries will have to give Japan most-favored-nation treatment," "Pakistan hopes to minimize interference with the country's domestic economy" (April 20, Reuters).
    In short, before Japan has gained true independence and autonomy, and under the circumstances that the Japanese economy is monopolized and controlled by American monopoly capitalists, all "preferential treatment" is an excuse for the United States to carry out endless plunder.
    Moreover, the United States is operating the Japanese economy for military purposes. The Japanese economic production and trade controlled and manipulated by the United States mainly serve the military needs of the United States. In the war of aggression against Korea alone, as of March 11 this year, the US military's general military orders in Japan have reached 240,431,000 US dollars. The direct military equipment manufactured by Japanese arms factories for the United States is not included.
    The US-made "Draft of the Treaty of Peace with Japan" does not mention a single word about restricting Japan's military industry, which is the inevitable content of the "Draft" with the main purpose of arming Japan. Dulles openly told reporters from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine: Turn Japan into an American arms factory to produce goods to support the war. (April 23, United Press)
    The United States is currently stepping up the expansion of a military economic system of "American capital profits, Japanese arsenals, and Southeast Asian raw material resources" in Asia. The so-called "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" between Japan and the Allied nations will naturally also be used to strengthen this system.
    We must expose the conspiracy of American imperialism.

　　美国怎样在经济上吞噬日本与侵害盟国
    ——揭穿美制《对日和约草案》经济条款包含的阴谋——
         林天摩
    荒谬绝伦的美制《对日和约草案》，不但显示要把日本生吞活剥，一口下肚，而且还企图囊括各盟国的合法权益，以遂私欲。尽管杜勒斯在《草案》文笔上怎样卖弄花样，掩耳盗铃，也掩盖不住美国帝国主义奴役日本、扩大侵略的野心。
    在经济条款上，杜勒斯卖弄条文技巧尤甚。粗看起来好像对日本很宽厚，对盟国很公平；但细细瞧来，你就会发现刀光剑影，血腥触鼻。
    《草案》第五章第十三条，是经济条款的中心条文，我们就拿这一条来分析吧。
    这一条规定了《和约》缔结后日本与盟国间的经济关系，主要是：（一）“日本声明它准备与各盟国迅速缔结条约或协定，以便将相互间之商业与贸易关系建立在稳固与友好的基础上”。（二）“日本政府在本条约一经生效后三年内，在关税、捐税及其他适用于进出口货及和进出口货有关的一切其他规章方面，均给予各盟国以最惠国的待遇。”而“任何一国要求日本给予优待，比较该国除其商约照例保留者外，所给予日本之优待为较高者，则日本得以拒绝之。”（三）“日本政府同时对盟国船只、国民、公司以及他们在日本的财产、利益及商业活动方面给予国民待遇，或最惠国待遇，视何者较为有利而决定之。”同样，“任何一国要求日本给予优待，比较该国除其商约照例保留者外，所给予日本之优待为较高者，则日本得以拒绝之。”
    简单地说，就是：“和约”缔结后日本即须与各盟国缔结“友好”的商业与贸易的条约或协定；怎样“友好”呢？“和约生效后三年内”的“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，就是范例；而“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，各盟国是“均等”的，日本与各盟国间则是“互惠”的。
    多么“公正”的条文！
    杜勒斯文笔上的技巧，的确是够高明的。但是，技巧虽然高明，可惜摆在眼前的事实，却太平凡。只要你闭着眼睛稍稍一想：今天的日本，是在谁的势力之下？今天的日本经济，已受谁的控制？就会恍然了。
    为谁“均等”为谁“惠”？说穿了，所谓均等就是美国的独占，所谓互惠就是美国的独惠。请看事实：
    大家都知道，美国对日本是军事占领国，日本则为被占领国（和约缔结的同时，美日并将订立军事协定，美军继续驻日）；美国是对日“援助”国，日本则为“受援”国；美国是债权国，日本则为债务国；美国经济力大，日本经济力小。以这样地位悬殊的两个国家，来谈经济“互惠”，实在是奇事。我们只见到美国过剩生产品大量涌进日本，却还没有听说过日本货霸占美国市场；我们也只见到美援、美国资本投向日本，深入日本各产业领域，却没有听说过日本人在美国到处开厂设店，大买股票。很明显，是谁享受“在关税、捐税及其他适用于进出口货及和进出口货有关的一切其他规章”的“最惠国待遇”呢？是谁享受“船只、国民、公司及财产、利益与商业活动”的“国民待遇或最惠国待遇”呢？是美国在日本，不是日本在美国。
    贸易数字告诉我们，从日本投降到一九五○年止，日本自美国输入的商品，总值约近二十二亿美元，而日本输往美国的，则只约四亿余美元，日本对美国的入超，达十七亿余美元，日美贸易完全一边倒。而且，日本自美国输入的，很多是美国过剩商品与剩余物资的倾销。有些本来可以在亚洲邻近国家以低价输入的，却被迫以高价输入美国的过剩品，如食粮与煤等。关税及其他有关输出入的措施，本来是经济居劣势的国家，常用作防御经济优势国家的侵入、保护本国工商业的手段；现在美国要日本“在关税、捐税及其他适用于进出口货及和进出口货有关的一切其他规章方面”，都须给美国以“最惠国的待遇”，范围如此广泛，这就等于把日本的通商门户洞开，让美国的商品得以畅入无阻，美国老板大赚钱，日本民族工业破产！
    美国操纵日本贸易由来已久，最近更有新鲜的例子。三月三十一日日本议会把原来拟就的进口税法案大加修改，减免了许多种美国货物的进口税，就是受到美国压力的结果。美国至上，日本关税竟反而成了保护美国货倾销的工具了。
    美国不但操纵日本的贸易，而且以美援资金及各种投资方式，控制了整个日本经济。美援资金名义上算是“援助”，实际上是推销美国的过剩商品，这是以输入物资的方式作为援助的。不管这些物资日本需要不需要，也不管价格合不合，日本必须接受。上述日本投降后迄一九五○年止日本自美国输入约近二十二亿美元的商品中，所谓美援物资几达二十亿美元。一九四九年起，美援输入物资名下还成立了一个所谓“美援对等基金”的特别会计科目，即是，美援物资输入日本折算日圆后，必须专户存储，建立特别会计，并列入国家预算，其用途完全受美国支配，美国借此操纵财政、金融、生产、贸易等日本经济的全部。
    除以“美援资金”控制外，美国还以所谓私人资本的名义，打入日本各种生产事业。美国资本以投资、合作、收买股票等方式、已与日本很多企业发生密切关系，尤其如石油业、机械工业、化学工业、钢铁工业、船舶业、电业等。像美国“美孚油公司”，且已取得日本著名的“东亚燃料会社”百分之五十一的股权。旧三井、三菱、住友、安田等大财阀系统的产业，也莫不有美国资本。
    美国银行、一般公司、贸易行与各种商社，也在日本到处设立，到处做买卖，获得巨额利润。日本反动政府奉美国的命令，还设立专门欢迎外资入国的委员会，制订保护外资、优待外资的法令，如允许外资企业将其赚得的利润以外币汇回本国，给予外资企业寻地觅屋的便利，及保证不施差别待遇等等。所谓外资，主要自然就是美国资本。
    最近，美日经济界人士信使往还频繁，日本各种产业正与美国资本家谈商吸收美资的办法，有些且已陆续签订了“投资合作”的合同。据日本每日新闻载，整个“美日经济合作计划”的草案，也已完成。四月二十一日吉田在大阪对日本工商界人士的演说，还曾歌颂麦克阿瑟曾经向他“诚意的劝告”：“日本应该与美国热心合作，把日本经济变为美国经济的一部分。”吉田同时又无耻地“强调指出外国投资尤其是美国投资的重要性，并敦促必须努力保证投资者的大量利润”。（四月二十二日法新社东京电）这就是说：日本经济必须为美国资本家扩大利润而服务！
    由此我们可以明白了解，美制“对日和约草案”规定“日本政府同时对盟国船只、国民、公司以及他们在日本的财产、利益及商业活动方面给予国民待遇，或最惠国待遇”，其目的何在？
    美日“互惠”关系如此，那么，其他盟国的地位怎样呢？如前述，所谓“互惠”就是美国的独惠，所谓“均等”就是美国的独占。
    以贸易为例，日本投降后迄一九五○年止，日本总输入额约值三十三亿余美元，其中美国近二十二亿美元，几达三分之二；同时期日本总输出额约值十八亿余美元，其中美国约四亿余美元，占四分之一强；而同时期日本总入超额约十四亿余美元，对美入超却达十七亿余美元，超过总入超额。这说明日本的贸易，对美国是入超，对其他各国合计，则为出超。美国正极力帮助着日本对其他各国的输出（当然以不影响美国货的销路为限），借以提高日本自美国输入商品的力量，及换取他国特别是东南亚国家的军需原料，扩张美国在日本的军事工业。日本对各国的输出商品中，不少且有美国资本在内，美国资本家知道，投资日本经营生产与买卖，有时比在美国本国有利。日本廉价劳动力一向为美国资本家所赏识，一般企业的工资，美国国内的工人要比日本工人高十倍左右或十倍以上，纺织工业达十四、五倍。
    很显然，日本的经济与贸易在美国一手操纵控制之下，所谓“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”的“互惠”与“均等”，对各盟国不但得不到好处，而且会大吃其亏。最近美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿鲁斯克，在众议院拨款委员会上的讲话，把美国利用日本拓展市场与搜刮原料的自私打算，表现得非常露骨，他说：“如果日本能够分配到它所需要的一份原料，如果它能够取得东南亚与南亚的市场，它的情况便不需要巨额的补助”；“现在的问题是，替日本找到它的产品的原料与市场”。（四月二十五日合众社）
    所以，所谓“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，不但是美国束缚日本经济的绳索，而且又是美国利用日本束缚其他盟国特别是东南亚国家的绳索。
    美国这样做法，甚至连英国也已感到惶惶不安而哀鸣，伦敦泰晤士报警告：要防止“日本的新经济侵略”（四月二十三日合众社）；英国《经济学者》周刊指出：“缔结对日和约的前景，并不使恐惧增加了的市场竞争的英国商人们的神经安静。”（四月七日法新社）英格兰布拉德福德染业协会主席伊文担心：“在西欧生活水平下，可能没有任何国家能够与现有条件下的日本生产成本相竞争”（四月五日美联社）。巴基斯坦人士也表示：“根据技术方面的理由，反对美国草案中给日本以最惠国待遇的条款”，据说：“巴基斯坦政府认为，如果保留这一条款，则签字国将必须给日本以最惠国待遇”，“巴基斯坦希望尽少妨害该国的国内经济”（四月二十日路透社）。
    总之，在日本没有获得真正独立自主之前，在日本经济是受着美国独占资本家垄断控制的状况下，一切“优惠”，都是美国实行无止境的掠夺的借口。
    还不仅如此，美国并且是在军事目的上，经营日本经济。美国操纵控制下的日本经济生产与贸易，主要是为着美国军事需要而服务。仅在侵朝战争中，迄至今年三月十一日止，美军在日本的一般军需定货，就已达二亿四千零四十三万一千美元。日本军火工厂为美国制造直接的军火，尚不在内。
    美制“对日和约草案”中没有一字一句提到要限制日本军需工业，这是以武装日本为主要目的的“草案”的必然内容。杜勒斯公开告知《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志的记者：要把日本变成美国的军火工厂，生产支持战争的货物。（四月二十三日合众社）
    美国目前正在亚洲加紧扩组“资本利润美国、兵工厂日本、原料资源东南亚”的军事性的经济体系，所谓日本与盟国间的“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，自然亦将为加强这一体系而使用。
    我们必须揭穿美国帝国主义的阴谋。
