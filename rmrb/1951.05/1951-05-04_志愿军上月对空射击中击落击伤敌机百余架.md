　　Volunteer Army Shot Down and Damaged Over a Hundred Enemy Planes in Air Combat Last Month
    [News Agency Report] According to Xinhua News Agency's dispatch from the Korean front: In April, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shot down and damaged a total of 108 enemy fighter planes and bombers of various types on the Korean battlefield. Among them, 74 enemy planes were shot down, a number equivalent to the aircraft of a U.S. Air Force fighter group (note: a U.S. Air Force fighter group has 75 fighter planes). That is to say, in the past month's air combat, our army annihilated the equivalent of a U.S. Air Force fighter group. In the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, anti-aircraft shooting has begun to take the form of a mass movement. Whether at the front or in the rear, whether anti-aircraft units or infantry units, and whether combatants or other personnel, many people are using heroic and calm fighting spirit, holding all available weapons, and launching fierce shooting at enemy planes. The brilliant achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in fighting enemy planes in April have further enhanced their courage and confidence in shooting down planes.

　　志愿军上月对空射击中击落击伤敌机百余架
    【本报讯】据新华社朝鲜前线电：中国人民志愿军四月份在朝鲜战场上共击落、击伤各种型式的敌战斗机和轰炸机一百零八架。其中被击落的敌机为七十四架，这个数目即相等于美空军一个战斗机大队的飞机架数（按：美空军一个战斗机大队有战斗机七十五架）。这就是说，我军在上个月的对空射击中，等于歼灭了敌空军的一个战斗机大队。在我志愿军部队中，对空射击已开始形成为一个群众性的运动。不论前线或后方，不论防空部队或步兵部队，也不论战斗员或其他人员，许多人用英勇沉着的战斗精神，手持一切可用的武器，对敌机展开猛烈射击。中国人民志愿军在四月份对敌机作战的辉煌成绩，更加提高了自己打飞机的勇气和信心。
