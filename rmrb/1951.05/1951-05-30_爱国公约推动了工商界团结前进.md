　　Patriotic Pledges Promote Unity and Progress in the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

　　Since the industrial and commercial sectors of Beijing established patriotic pledges on November 7th of last year, industrial and commercial sectors in major and medium cities and many small cities and towns across the country have established patriotic pledges for towns and industrial and commercial sectors, as well as for various industries and small units. In Shanghai alone, more than 60,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in more than 210 industries, and in Beijing, more than 20,000 households in more than 130 industries, have formulated their programs of patriotic action. Due to the signing of these patriotic pledges, the national industrial and commercial sectors have united more closely around the Communist Party and the People's Government, consolidating the people's democratic united front.

　　Many local industrialists and businessmen have earnestly fulfilled the patriotic pledges, and have made great achievements in fulfilling tax obligations, assisting the government in stabilizing prices, improving management, and strengthening unity. First, the majority of local industrialists and businessmen fulfilled the article in the patriotic pledge regarding enthusiastically paying taxes, and paid their 1950 business income tax on schedule. Industrial and commercial figures in Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places organized collective tax payment parades involving thousands or even tens of thousands of people. In the dyeing and weaving industry and the new medicine industry in Shanghai, more than 100 companies paid more than 40 billion yuan in taxes ahead of schedule. The industrial and commercial sectors in Chongqing have begun to establish a unified accounting system for all industries and handle unified invoices, making the tax system more in line with the principle of reasonable burden.

　　Many industrial and commercial figures have put into practice the article in the patriotic pledge about "assisting the People's Government in stabilizing prices." Before the Spring Festival, industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai, Wuhan, Wuxi, Shenyang, and other places signed pledges to ensure stable prices during the Spring Festival. Under the correct leadership of the People's Government and with the conscious assistance of the industrial and commercial sectors, prices did not fluctuate during this year's Spring Festival, breaking the convention of "not buying goods in the twelfth lunar month," and creating an unprecedented situation in China for decades, which was sincerely praised by the people.

　　Some local industrialists and businessmen have actively fulfilled the articles in their patriotic pledges regarding "improving management and developing urban-rural exchanges," expanding their business scope. 1,176 industrial households and 585 commercial households in Wuhan City have begun joint procurement, reaching deep into the countryside. Industrialists and businessmen in Baotou City, Suiyuan Province, organized joint sales groups for groceries, general merchandise, and vendors, reaching deep into grassland areas. According to the needs of spring plowing production in rural areas, the industrial and commercial sectors of Tangyin County, Pingyuan Province, prepared the production and living materials needed by farmers.

　　The establishment of patriotic pledges has also strengthened the unity of the industrial and commercial sectors in terms of business and politics. After signing the pledge, the Shanghai tobacco silk industry improved the relations between the four groups of Xi'an, Lanzhou, Benjie, and dry tobacco, and the phenomenon of blind competition has been eliminated. After signing the pledge, the awning and sail industry established a business committee to handle government processing business in a unified manner, allocating it to large, medium, and small members according to proportions, which not only adjusted the relationship between public and private sectors, but also promoted the spirit of mutual assistance among members.

　　The achievements of industrial and commercial sectors in various places in fulfilling patriotic pledges are inseparable from the rising patriotic enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen and the organizational leadership role of local federations of industry and commerce. Before establishing patriotic pledges, federations of industry and commerce in various places generally organized various current affairs report meetings and symposiums. Due to the victorious development of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the influence of the patriotic upsurge of the national movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, many industrial and commercial figures have recognized the power of the people and initially eliminated pro-American, worshipful, and fearful thoughts of America. They denounced and recalled the facts that national industry and commerce were devastated during the period of Japanese puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule, and compared the flourishing situation of national industry and commerce under the support of the People's Government after liberation. They strengthened their hatred of the enemy and their love for the motherland, and further clarified their flesh-and-blood relationship with the motherland. Based on this ideological awareness, local federations of industry and commerce promptly organized industrialists and businessmen to establish patriotic pledges, and deeply established pledges for various industries and households with the development of the situation.

　　However, the degree to which the industrial and commercial sectors fulfill patriotic pledges is very uneven, and tax evasion and other fraudulent and illegal acts continue to occur in the industrial and commercial sectors in many places. Therefore, the main task of the industrial and commercial sectors at present is to implement the patriotic pledges. In this regard, local federations of industry and commerce and all patriotic activists in the industrial and commercial sectors should do a lot of work. This spring, the Changshu County Federation of Industry and Commerce in Jiangsu Province, in conjunction with the tax bureau, combined the assessment of spring business tax to conduct a general inspection of the implementation of patriotic pledges by industry and by household. When it was discovered that some people were not fulfilling the provision in the patriotic pledge of "no tax evasion or tax arrears," the Federation of Industry and Commerce immediately led the industrial and commercial sectors in the county to supplement and revise the new content of "saving tax money in advance to ensure collective tax payment." This approach is worth promoting. Contrary to the above situation, after the industrial and commercial sectors in Baotou City, Chahar Province, established patriotic pledges, the local federation of industry and commerce did not grasp the leadership inspection. A recent spot check by the tax bureau found that 70% of the city's tax-evading industrial and commercial households evaded taxes this year, and the amount of tax evasion per household ranged from 10% to 500% of the turnover.

　　In order to ensure that the patriotic pledges truly play a role, the industrial and commercial sectors in some places have also organized mass supervision and inspection. The experience of the Yuechi County Industrial and Commercial Preparatory Committee in western Sichuan in organizing mass movements to check patriotic pledges through current affairs and political study is worthy of reference in various places. From April 27th to May 13th, in half a month, 1,600 of the 1,987 industrial and commercial households in the city participated in current affairs study, and universally launched denunciations of American and Japanese imperialism. Under the leadership of activists, industrial and commercial households in various industries criticized and self-criticized themselves based on the "Patriotic Pledge," exposing and criticizing many profiteering thoughts and illegal acts. According to statistics of self-examination materials of only 549 households, 261 households underreported turnover, 236 households evaded taxes, and 36 households were in arrears of taxes. Two hundred and sixty-four other cases of fraudulent behavior, adulteration, and shoddy workmanship were also investigated. After this mass inspection, the ideology of the industrial and commercial sectors in Yuechi County has greatly improved, laying the foundation for fulfilling the patriotic pledges. They all said: "Do not violate the patriotic pledges, we will report anyone who violates them!"

### 爱国公约推动了工商界团结前进

　　爱国公约推动了工商界团结前进
    苏宜
    自从去年十一月七日北京市工商界订立爱国公约以后，全国各大中城市和许多小城市、集镇的工商界，都订立了城镇工商界的乃至各行各业各小单位的爱国公约。仅上海就有二百十余行业的六万多工商企业单位、北京有一百三十多行业的二万多户，订出了他们的爱国行动纲领。由于这些爱国公约的签订，全国工商界已经更加紧密地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，巩固了人民民主统一战线。
    许多地方的工商业者，认真地履行了爱国公约，在执行纳税任务、协助政府稳定物价、改善经营以及加强团结等方面，都已有了很大成绩。首先是多数地方的工商业者履行了爱国公约中关于踊跃纳税的条文，如期缴纳了一九五○年的营业所得税。重庆、上海、北京、南京、无锡等地的工商界人士，都组织了数千人乃至数万人的集体纳税大游行。上海染织业和新药业中，更有一百多家提前缴纳了四百多亿元的税款。重庆工商界则开始建立各业统一账簿制度，并办理统一发票，使税收制度更符合合理负担的原则。
    许多工商界人士实践了爱国公约中“协助人民政府平稳物价”的条文。在春节前，上海、武汉、无锡、沈阳等地的工商界，都订立了保证春节物价平稳的公约。在人民政府的正确领导以及工商界的自觉协助之下，今年春节物价没有波动，打破了“有钱不买腊月货”的惯例，出现了中国几十年来空前未有的局面，受到人民衷心的赞许。
    有些地方的工商业者，积极履行了他们爱国公约内“改善经营，发展城乡交流”的条文，扩大了他们的营业范围。武汉市工业一千一百七十六户、商业五百八十五户开始了联合采购，深入农村。绥远省包头市工商业者组织了杂货、百货以及摊贩的联合售货组，深入草原地区。平原省汤阴县工商界根据农村中春耕生产的需要，准备了农民所需要的生产与生活资料。
    爱国公约的订立，也加强了工商界在业务上和在政治上的团结。上海烟丝商业在订立公约以后，改善了他们内部的西安、兰州、本街、旱烟等四种帮别之间的关系，相互盲目竞争的现象已经消除。篷帆业在订立公约以后，成立了业务委员会，统办政府加工业务，按比例分配给大中小会员，既调整了公私关系，又发扬了会员间的互助精神。
    各地工商界履行爱国公约的成绩，是和工商业者爱国热情的高涨以及各地工商业联合会的组织领导作用分不开的。在订立爱国公约之前，各地工商业联合会一般组织了各种时事报告会、座谈会。由于抗美援朝战争的胜利发展以及全国抗美援朝运动爱国高潮的影响，工商界人士许多已认识人民的力量，初步清除了亲美、崇美、恐美的思想。他们控诉和回忆了日伪及国民党反动统治时期民族工商业横遭摧残的事实，对比了解放以后民族工商业在人民政府扶植下欣欣向荣的情况。他们加强了对敌人的仇恨和对祖国的热爱，进一步明确了自己与祖国的血肉关系。在这样的思想觉悟基础上，各地工商业联合会及时组织了工商业者订立爱国公约，并随着形势的发展而深入订立各行业和各户的公约。
    但是工商界履行爱国公约的程度是很不平衡的，偷漏税款以及其他欺骗不法行为在许多地方的工商界中仍然继续发生。因此，目前工商界的主要任务就是贯彻实行爱国公约。在这方面，各地工商业联合会和一切工商界中的爱国积极分子应该做很多工作。江苏省常熟县工商业联合会协同税务局在今春结合春季营业税的评议，分业分户地普遍检查了一次爱国公约的贯彻程度。当发现有一部分人不履行爱国公约中“不逃税、欠税”的规定时，工商业联合会立即领导全县工商界补订了“预先储蓄税款，保证集体缴税”的新内容。这种做法是值得提倡的。与上述情形相反，察哈尔省包头市工商界自订立爱国公约后，该地工商业联合会没有抓紧领导检查。最近税局抽查结果，发现今年全市漏税工商户仍达总户数百分之七十，每户漏税额由营业额百分之十起到百分之五百。
    为了使爱国公约确实发挥作用，有些地方的工商界还组织了群众性的监督、检查。川西岳池县工商业筹备委员会通过时事政治学习，组织群众性的检查爱国公约运动的经验，是值得各地参考的。自四月二十七日到五月十三日的半个月中，该市工商户一千九百八十七户中有一千六百人参加了时事学习，普遍展开对美、日帝国主义的控诉。在积极分子带头下，各行业工商业户纷纷以“爱国公约”为标准进行批评和自我批评，暴露并批判了许多暴利思想和不法行为。仅据五百四十九户自我检讨的材料统计，少报营业额者有二百六十一户，逃漏税款者有二百三十六户，拖欠税款者有三十六户。其他有欺骗行为，掺杂行为、偷工减料行为者也检查出二百六十四起。经过了这次群众性的检查，岳池县工商界的思想大大提高一步，奠定了履行爱国公约的基础。他们都说：“不要违犯爱国公约，谁违犯了我们要检举他！”
