　　Seizing Moisture to Rush Planting, Transporting Water for Spot Planting
　　Handan Prefecture Launches Patriotic Cotton Planting Campaign
　　Over 1.2 Million Mu of Sowing Area Completed

    The drought-resistant cotton planting campaign in Handan Prefecture, a famous cotton-producing area in Hebei Province, has been enthusiastically launched under the slogan of resisting America and aiding Korea with patriotic cotton planting.

    The entire prefecture started seizing moisture to rush planting and transporting water for spot planting around April 17th. By around April 25th, over 1.2 million mu had been sown, nearly one-third of the original cotton planting plan of 3,925,000 mu. Among all counties in the prefecture, Qiu County and Daming County made the fastest progress. By the 25th, Qiu County had planted over 253,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by over 23,000 mu. By the 24th, Daming had completed the planned 150,000 mu. Quzhou, Feixiang, and Guantao counties have each completed around 150,000 to 200,000 mu. The counties with relatively slow progress are Ci County, Wu'an, and Yongnian, with each completing less than 50,000 mu.

    After the start of the cotton planting campaign, the prefecture immediately transferred 360 cadres to assist the work in various counties. The commissioner and the secretary of the CCP Prefectural Committee also personally went to various counties to inspect, identify problems, and provide timely assistance. The prefecture and various counties have established joint offices of the government and the Party Committee to monitor the cotton planting situation, study problems, disseminate experiences, and vigorously promote the development of the cotton planting campaign.

    The reasons why the drought-resistant cotton planting campaign in the prefecture could be carried out smoothly are: First, the crash planting of cotton was closely integrated with the Resist America and Aid Korea movement. For example, in order to carry out this work, Daming County trained 226 propagandists to conduct propaganda on resisting America and planting patriotic cotton. Every village in the county had its production plan and patriotic covenant posted. Many villages conducted ideological education on patriotic anti-Americanism through accusation meetings, grievance meetings, thought meetings, old men's meetings, women's meetings, and used various forms such as blackboards, loudspeakers, cartoons, and quick-patter rhymes, making the masses realize that "completing the cotton planting plan is a practical action to resist America and aid Korea." The situation in Qiu County was similar. Therefore, these two counties completed the cotton planting plan quickly and well. After Liyuan Village in Linqing held an accusation meeting, it not only completed the original plan but also exceeded it by 300 mu. After conducting anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, 70 households in Malantou Village, Quzhou temporarily stopped building houses, quickly organized mutual assistance, dug 38 earthen wells in two days, and carried out spot planting. Second, the campaign specifically addressed the paralyzing wait-for-rain mentality of cadres and the masses, effectively grasped the season and soil moisture conditions, and promoted planting methods suitable for the specific conditions of various places, such as seizing moisture when available and transporting water when moisture is lacking, laying the foundation for the masses' confidence in resisting drought. Initially, cadres and the masses in areas with better soil moisture or irrigation conditions were not in a hurry; in areas with less moisture, there was a widespread wait-for-rain mentality. In order to solve these problems, the CCP Handan Local Committee and various counties made specific instructions, and promptly informed various places about the cotton planting situation and introduced various methods for drought-resistant rush planting. At a mobilization meeting of county, district, and village cadres in Qiu County, people who benefited from early planting last year were mobilized to give reports, and the methods of calculating land, tools, and time were used to illustrate that planting cotton now was not too early. After discovering the method of the masses in Zhongdian Village, Quzhou County, discarding dry soil and digging pits to borrow moisture for sowing, the Deputy Secretary of the CCP Quzhou County Committee quickly informed the whole county to imitate it. However, in some areas, such as Wu'an, Ci County, and Handan counties, due to the lack of the habit of seizing moisture and borrowing moisture among the masses, and the leading cadres did not look at the specific situation of whether there was moisture or not, and focused on mobilizing water transportation for spot planting, resulting in wasted labor and delayed sowing time. These areas have now adopted methods such as inspecting moisture content and inviting experts in seizing moisture and borrowing moisture to teach, in order to correct this deviation. Third, organize mutual assistance and specifically solve the difficulties of labor, animal power, tools and water sources. For example, Lu Bazhuang in the first district of Wei County organized five mutual aid groups including three households of the old, weak, widowed and orphans, and twenty children, and carried out scientific division of labor within the group, and planted 30 mu in two days. In Menggu Village, Qiu County, 40 out of 43 households were organized, and the sowing plan was completed in five days. Daming First and Second Districts had little moisture, and mobilized farmers to dig 225 earthen wells to solve the water source difficulties. In Wu'an mountainous area, it was not easy to dig wells, so the county borrowed 200 gasoline drums for the farmers to transport water for spot planting. In the spot planting area, all the furniture that could hold water was used. Fourth, conduct in-depth inspections, understand the situation, and solve problems. After arriving in the village, cadres at all levels conducted door-to-door inspections. If it was found that seeds and fertilizers were insufficient, they tried to lend and sell cotton seeds and promote bean cakes. Because Quzhou conducted inspections, understood the soil moisture situation, and grasped the policy of borrowing moisture and spot planting at the same time, the work progressed quickly.

### 趁墒抢种、运水点种  邯郸专区展开爱国植棉运动  已完成播种面积一百二十余万亩

　　趁墒抢种、运水点种
    邯郸专区展开爱国植棉运动
    已完成播种面积一百二十余万亩
    河北省著名产棉区邯郸专区的抗旱植棉运动，在抗美援朝爱国植棉的口号鼓舞下，现已热烈展开。
    全专区自四月十七日左右，开始抢墒播种和运水点种。至二十五日左右，已播种一百二十余万亩，几占原植棉计划三百九十二万五千亩的三分之一。全专区各县以邱县、大名进展最快，邱县到二十五日已种二十五万三千余亩，超过原计划二万三千余亩，大名至二十四日已完成十五万亩的计划。曲周、肥乡、馆陶等县，均完成十五万亩至二十万亩左右。进展较差的县为磁县、武安、永年，完成的数字均不到五万亩。
    植棉运动开始后，该专区即抽调干部三百六十人，到各县帮助工作。专员及中共地委书记等亦亲赴各县检查，发现问题，及时帮助解决。专区和各县均组织了政府和党委的联合办公室，掌握种棉情况，研究问题，传播经验，有力地推动了植棉运动的向前发展。
    该专区抗旱植棉运动所以能够顺利开展的原因是：一、突击种棉密切结合了抗美援朝运动。如大名县为开展这一工作、曾训练了二百二十六个宣传员，进行抗美爱国植棉的宣传。该县每个村都贴着本村的生产计划和爱国公约。很多村庄都通过控诉会、诉苦会、想想会、老头会、妇女会，并运用了黑板报、广播筒、漫画、快板等各种形式，进行了抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育，使群众认识到“完成植棉计划就是抗美援朝的实际行动”。邱县的情形也是如此。因此，该两县完成植棉计划又快又好。临清梨园村开了控诉会后，不仅完成了原计划，还超过了三百亩。曲周马兰头村在进行了抗美援朝的宣传后，七十户暂时停止盖房子，迅速组织互助，两天挖土井三十八眼，进行点种。二、具体解决干部和群众的麻痹等雨思想，切实掌握了季节及墒土情况，提倡有墒抢墒，无墒运水等适合各地具体情况的播种办法，奠定了群众的抗旱信心。开始，墒土较好或有灌溉条件的地区，干部和群众都表现不慌不忙；墒小的地区普遍存在着等雨思想。为了解决这些思想，中共邯郸地方委员会及各县都作了具体指示，并及时通报各地植棉情况，介绍抗旱抢种的各种办法。邱县在全县的县、区、村干部动员会上，发动去年早种得利的人作报告，又用算土地、算工具、算时间的办法，说明现在种棉已不算早。中共曲周县委会副书记在重点村发现群众抛掉干土，挖坑借墒下种的办法后，很快通报全县仿效。但在某些地区，如武安、磁县、邯郸等县，由于群众缺乏抢墒借墒习惯，领导干部又不看有墒无墒的具体情况，偏重发动运水点种，以致浪费劳力，推迟了播种时间。现这些地区已采取验墒和邀请抢墒借墒能手教导等办法，纠正这一偏向。三、组织互助，具体解决劳力、畜力、工具与水源的困难。如魏县一区吕八庄组织了包括三户老弱孤寡和二十个小孩的五个互助组，在组内进行科学分工，两天就点种了三十亩。邱县孟固村四十三户，组织起来的就有四十户，五天完成了播种计划。大名一、二区墒小，发动农民挖了二百二十五个土井，解决了水源困难。武安山区不易挖井，县里给农民们借来二百个汽油桶，运水点种。在点种地区，一切能盛水的家具都被使用上了。四、深入检查，了解情况，解决问题。各级干部到村后，都进行了挨户检查。检查出籽种，肥料不够，就设法贷卖棉种，推销豆饼。曲周因为进行检查，了解了墒土情况，掌握了借墒同时点种的方针，工作开展很快。
