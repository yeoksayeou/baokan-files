National Cotton Field Sowing Nearly Completed
Some Regions are Transplanting Seedlings, Replenishing Seedlings, and Rush-Planting Late-Season Cotton
    The sowing of cotton fields across the country is nearing completion. Currently, apart from some mid-cotton areas and regions with a tradition of planting late-season cotton that are making a final push, the sowing work in most cotton-producing areas has essentially concluded.
    Since the launch of the patriotic production increase campaign, farmers in various cotton-producing areas have put forward slogans such as "Plant more patriotic cotton." Inspired by their high patriotic zeal and production enthusiasm, they have victoriously completed the sowing tasks amidst the struggle against uneven rainfall.
    The North China region, which accounts for 40% of the country's cotton production, has victoriously completed drought-resistant sowing with the active efforts of all cotton farmers, exceeding the original plan by more than 3 million mu. The entire East China region has basically completed its planned cotton planting area, with Shandong exceeding its original plan by 600,000 mu. Except for northern and southern Jiangsu, which are still rush-planting, provinces and regions such as Zhejiang, northern Anhui, and southern Anhui have also basically completed their tasks. In the Northeast region, Liaoxi Province, under relatively severe drought conditions, stubbornly carried out sowing using methods such as seizing soil moisture and dry planting waiting for rain, and planted an additional 495,000 mu after completing the original plan. In Rehe Province, due to the particularly severe drought and great difficulty in planting cotton, only a small portion of the original plan was completed. Cotton planting work in areas such as eastern Liaoning and Jilin has basically concluded. The Northwest has also completed sowing according to plan, with Shaanxi exceeding the target. The cotton seedlings have emerged and are growing very well. In the Central South region, Henan Province exceeded the original plan by 100,000 mu, Hubei Province is nearing completion, and Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces experienced excessive rain and cold temperatures in March and April, severely affecting cotton planting. Currently, only 20% to 25% has been completed, and rush-planting is continuing. The Southwest region has a smaller cotton planting area. Except for Yunnan and Guizhou, which failed to complete their tasks due to drought, and northern Sichuan, which failed due to excessive rain, western Kang, western Sichuan, and southern Sichuan have all completed their cotton planting tasks.
    Cotton seedlings have emerged successively in various places. Cotton seedlings on both sides of the Longhai Railway are growing well. In Liaoxi, Rehe, and parts of Hebei, the phenomenon of missing seedlings is quite common due to drought. In many areas south of the Yangtze River, some seeds have rotted due to excessive rain and cold temperatures, and seedling emergence is uneven. Cotton farmers in these areas are carrying out transplanting, seedling replenishment, and seedling protection work with great intensity. Regions in southern China with a larger amount of mid-season cotton, such as northern and southern Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan, as well as areas with experience in planting late-season cotton in Henan, the plains, and southern Shanxi, are making a final push to plant cotton. Recently, cotton aphids and wireworms have been found to be harmful in cotton-producing areas north of the Yellow River. Some areas have implemented the spirit of "prevention is more important than treatment" and are carrying out weeding and pest control work. For example, in Shulu and Mancheng counties in Hebei Province, women and children removed nearly 500,000 jin of weeds within ten days in mid-May. This work is of great importance to protecting cotton seedlings and increasing yields, and should urgently attract the attention of various places. (Attached pictures)

### 全国棉田播种接近完成  部分地区正进行移苗、补苗、抢种晚花

　　全国棉田播种接近完成
    部分地区正进行移苗、补苗、抢种晚花
    全国棉田播种已接近完成。目前除部分中棉区和种晚花有习惯地区正最后突击播种外，绝大部分棉区的播种工作已基本结束。
    自爱国丰产运动开展以来，各产棉区农民纷纷提出“多种爱国棉”等口号。他们为高度的爱国热忱和生产积极性所鼓舞，在战胜雨水不调的斗争中，胜利地完成了播种任务。
    占全国棉花产量百分之四十的华北区，在全体棉农积极努力下，胜利地完成了抗旱播种，并超过原计划三百余万亩。华东全区已基本完成了计划植棉面积，山东超过了原定计划六十万亩，除苏北、苏南尚未完成还正在抢种外，浙江、皖北、皖南等省区也已基本完成。东北区的辽西省，在比较严重的亢旱情况下，用抢墒和干种待雨等方法顽强地进行播种，在完成了原定计划后又多种四十九万五千亩。热河省由于旱象特别严重，种棉困难太大，仅完成原计划的一小部分。辽东、吉林等地种棉工作已基本结束。西北也已按计划完成播种，陕西超额完成，棉苗都已出土，生长得极好。中南区的河南省超过原计划十万亩，湖北省接近完成，湖南、江西两省三、四月间雨多地凉，严重影响植棉，现仅完成百分之二十到二十五，正继续抢播。西南区种棉面积较小，除云南、贵州因天旱川北因多雨未能完成外，西康、川西、川南均已完成植棉任务。
    各地棉苗均已陆续出土，陇海线南北两侧棉苗生长较好。辽西、热河及河北部分地区，由于干旱，缺苗现象相当普遍。长江以南很多地区，由于雨多地寒，部分种子腐烂，出苗不齐。这些地区的棉农正紧张进行移苗补苗和保苗工作。我国南部中棉较多的地区，如苏北、苏南、湖北、江西、湖南等地，以及河南、平原、山西南部等地种晚花有经验地区，正最后突击种棉。最近黄河以北各产棉区均已相继发现棉蚜和金针虫等为害，有些地区贯彻了“防重于治”的精神，正开展除草治虫工作，如河北省束鹿、满城两县在五月中旬十天内已发动妇女儿童除草近五十万斤。这一工作对保育棉苗，增加产量关系至大，亟应引起各地注意。（附图片）
