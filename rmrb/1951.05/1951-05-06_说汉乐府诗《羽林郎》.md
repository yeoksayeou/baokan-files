Talking about the Han Yuefu Poem "Yu Lin Lang"
Yu Pingbo
Editor's note: From around 100 years before the Common Era, the Yuefu agency undertook an important task: collecting folk songs from various places. This work yielded substantial results, allowing many creations of the Han Dynasty people to be passed down. These folk songs are called "Yuefu Poems," becoming a precious legacy in Chinese literature. They reflect, to a certain extent, the lives of the people at that time, express their thoughts and emotions, and inherit the excellent traditions of Chinese literature since the Book of Songs, constantly influencing later poets close to the people. Providing a suitable explanation for these folk songs remains necessary for us. This article discusses "Yu Lin Lang," one of the Yuefu poems.

Yuefu lyrics passed down since the Han and Wei dynasties are, to a greater or lesser extent, capable of expressing the hardships of the masses. The saying "The hungry sing of their food, the laborers sing of their work" (He Xiu's commentary on the Gongyang Commentary), "Men and women who are not in their proper place sing together, each speaking of their sorrows" (Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Money), can serve as proof. Some materials were collected and preserved by government agencies. For example, the "Yuefu" established during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty was vast in scale, with a staff of up to eight hundred, and the collected lyrics and musical scores covered the entire country. There is a clear record of this in the Book of Han, Treatise on Literature, but unfortunately, much of it has been lost. The Yuefu poems currently transmitted are mostly works from the Eastern Han Dynasty. The circumstances of collecting poems in the two Han dynasties were probably similar.

The themes of "Yu Lin Lang" and "Mulberry on the Path" are very similar, both depicting a woman resisting violence. However, the impression gained from reading "Yu Lin Lang" seems to lean towards intensity, while reading "Mulberry on the Path," one feels it is very understated, and the struggle is not very sharp. In fact, the two poems depict heroines whose attitudes are resolute, whose words are gentle yet stern, and these are completely the same, but the expressive techniques are different. This article only discusses "Yu Lin Lang."

"In the past, there was a slave of the Huo family, named Feng Zidu, who, relying on the general's power, flirted with the Hu woman in the wine shop. The Hu girl was fifteen years old, tending the stove alone on a spring day, her long skirt connected with a love-knot belt, her wide sleeves with a double-happiness jacket, a piece of Lantian jade on her head, and large Qin pearls behind her ears. Her two buns were so graceful, unique in the world, each bun worth five million, the two buns worth more than ten million. Unexpectedly, the son of the Jinwu, graceful and charming, passed by my house, his silver saddle shining brightly, his green canopy hesitating in the air. He came to me for clear wine, with a silk rope carrying a jade pot; he came to me for precious delicacies, with a golden plate of sliced carp. He gave me a bronze mirror, tied me with a red silk skirt. He does not惜红罗裂，何论轻贱躯。Men love later wives, women value former husbands, life has new and old, nobility and baseness are not to be transgressed. Thank you 金吾子, private love is futile." Although this seems to tell a story of the Western Han Dynasty, it is a poem of the Eastern Han Dynasty, so-called "criticizing the present by citing the past," which is in line with the meaning of the three hundred poems. The so-called Huo family refers to General Huo Guang. The Eastern Han people spoke of the Western Han, hence the word "past." In fact, it refers to General Dou Xian or the Jinwu Dou Jing during the reign of Emperor He of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The poem's meaning is already determined in the opening four lines. From this poem, it appears that the power of the bullies at that time came in two forms: one was powerful aristocratic families, and the other was secret agents. The two were even colluding with each other. The poem is titled "Yu Lin Lang," and the poem says "Jinwu Zi." Commentators say that the Yu Lin Lang belongs to the Southern Army, and the Commandant of the Capital, that is, the Jinwu, belongs to the Northern Army. But whether it is the Southern Army or the Northern Army, they are all the emperor's guards, lackeys, without a doubt. As for how the Huo family and Dou family condoned their servants, it is all recorded in the Books of Han. Now, I will cite a passage from each.

"Initially, Guang loved the slave supervisor Feng Zidu, who often consulted with him on matters, and when Xian became a widow, she had illicit relations with Zidu. ... He sent a servant in coarse clothing to court, and no one dared to condemn him. ... Later, when the slaves of the two families fought over the road, the slave of the Huo family entered the Imperial Censor's office, wanting to trample on the door of the Grand Master, and the Imperial Censor bowed his head to apologize before he left."
(Biography of Huo Guang)

The Imperial Censor was the deputy prime minister in the Han Dynasty, and he had to kowtow to apologize to a family slave. The tyranny can be imagined. As for the slaves of the Dou family in the Eastern Han Dynasty, they made even more trouble, which is probably the subject of this poem. Dou Xian's brother was called Dou Jing.

"Jing was the Jinwu, surrounding the Guanglu Xun, his power and status were prominent and moved the capital. Although they were all arrogant and indulgent, Jing was especially so. His slaves and horsemen, relying on their power, invaded and bullied the common people, forcibly seized property, usurped criminals, kidnapped women, and merchants were blocked as if avoiding enemies." (Biography of Dou Rong)

The merchants were making such a fuss that they were going to strike. The text below says, "The officials were cowardly and dared not report. The Empress Dowager heard of it and sent an attendant to reprimand Jing and relieve him of his official position." Empress Dowager Dou did not know where she heard the news from, but she had to deal with it perfunctorily. From this historical text, in addition to the emperor's regular secret service police, there were also many petty secret agents of the slave class, attached to powerful families, the so-called slave customers and horsemen (horse teams wearing yellowish-red silk) "invading and bullying the common people," which in plain language means bullying the common people. What is written in the poem is actually a wicked slave of a noble aristocratic family. The so-called Yu Lin Lang and Jinwu Zi are just saying things. He is afraid that he is still far from that status. Since he dwells in it without doubt, people naturally dare not not call him that, so there is probably no need to delve deeply into whether his identity belongs to the Southern Army or the Northern Army. Whether he deliberately wanted to write it so that the north and south were indistinguishable to express this meaning, I dare not speculate.

Although his status is not high, his power is very great, at least more than enough to bully a fifteen-year-old Hu girl tending the stove. Therefore, no matter how firm her attitude is in the second half of this poem, the wording is very tactful. In fact, she has to say so; since she has to say so, she has to write so. This must be clearly understood first before the following text can be understood. Because the following text is easy to cause misunderstanding, especially these sentences:

"He gave me a bronze mirror, tied me with a red silk skirt, he does not惜红罗裂，何论轻贱躯。”

If you punctuate it like this, it is wrong. There should not be a "," after "red silk skirt," but a ".". The punctuation in the full text quoted above is more appropriate. Because the impression gained from suddenly reading these four sentences in one breath is as if the man is pulling the woman, and the woman tears her clothes and gets up. If that is really the case, the conflict is too much. As mentioned above, she does not dare (or does not want) to offend the "Jinwu Zi" like this. This impression is not very correct from the meaning of the poem.

In my opinion, the exegesis of two words must be clarified. Here I only describe my personal views, I dare not say it is accurate, but I have also discussed it with friends. These two words: one is the word "结" (tie), and the other is the word "裂" (tear). The so-called "结" is not pulling and tugging, but just trying to please the woman. 结, read as the "结" in "to want to knot," the "结" in "knotting a love knot, knotting a knot of unity." "He gave me a bronze mirror, tied me with a red silk skirt," the meaning of the text is completely clear, so a period should be used. "He gave me" and "tied me" are almost the same, but the bronze mirror is what the woman looks at, and the red silk skirt is what she wears, which is a deeper level, that is, a further step, so the words "give" and "tie" are also similar to flat and oblique, which is expressed extraordinarily appropriately. Read the above four sentences in a row, and it will be even clearer.

"He came to me for clear wine, with a silk rope carrying a jade pot; he came to me for precious delicacies, with a golden plate of sliced carp."

These four sentences are equivalent to the following two sentences, so a ";" is used in the middle to indicate. The two things that the man asks of the woman: good wine and good dishes, and the two things he gives her: a bronze mirror and red silk. Red silk can be made into a skirt, hence the saying "red silk skirt." Adding a skirt is a matter of rhyme.

Looking at the word "裂" (tear), it can be proved that what the man gave was only a new piece of red silk. 裂 read as the 裂 (tear) in "newly torn white silk" (Ban Jieyu's Song of Complaint). It can also be read as the 裂 (tear) in "tearing off the sound of the loom, the colors are shining" (Du Fu's White Silk). It is precisely because this word "tear" is easily misread, as if the woman tore her clothes and got up, but if this is the case, it would be too fierce. The Northern dialect still says to tear a piece of clothing material, which is the spread of the ancient meaning of this word "tear." However, when we say "tear" now, we always tear off a piece from the whole piece; the so-called "tear" in ancient poems is to tear off a piece from the loom. Du Fu's words are very clear. This luxurious Yu Lin Lang Jinwu Zi wants to curry favor, naturally a whole piece of red silk. To give her a few feet and inches, a short piece, wouldn't that be shabby? Also, in the poem "Peacock Flies Southeast," there is a sentence "five pieces are cut off in three days." "Cut off" means "tear," which also refers to the whole piece.

The reason why the two sentences "He does not惜红罗裂，何论轻贱躯 (He does not pity tearing the red silk, why talk about my humble body)" cause misunderstanding is not only about the explanation of the word "tear," but there is also a problem with the sentence structure, because two subjects are omitted here. If you fill them in, it is actually "You do not pity the red silk tearing, why should I talk about my humble body?" The red silk is raised so precious, and her own identity is devalued so humble, as if to agree in one breath, which is what the writer calls suppressing first and then raising, and then turning to the following "Men love later wives, women value former husbands, life has new and old, nobility and baseness are not to be transgressed," to resolutely refuse, gently and more strictly. "New and old" and "nobility and baseness" are mentioned extremely well. I think there are many places in ancient poems that are difficult to translate and understand directly.

Taking "Men love later wives, women value former husbands" as an example, it is difficult to understand it directly in the poem. What the Jinwu Zi likes is more than just a Hu girl, and it is not a problem to be a later wife; but, does a fifteen-year-old girl have a former husband? The poet's intention is just to say that men like the new, and women remember the old, that is, "new and old." It is necessary to understand the meaning of the poem, and not be confined to the literal meaning.

"Nobility and baseness are not to be transgressed" is also wonderful. It is like saying that no matter how noble you are, even owning a piece of red silk is nothing great; no matter how humble I am, even my own body is very cheap, but I just look down on you. You like the new, but I just remember the old. Zuo Si's poem on history, "The noble are noble, but they are seen as dust. The humble are humble, but they are valued as a thousand jun," can be borrowed to explain these three words "not to be transgressed." Therefore, the ending says, "Thank you Jinwu Zi, private love is futile," which means that your unrequited love has nothing to do with me, making the many lively scenes above snow-white and icy cold. Extremely disappointing, extremely happy.

Ancient poems have always regarded "gentle and honest" as teaching (see the chapter on the interpretation of the Book of Rites). Some people oppose it to "clear love and hate." I don't think this is necessarily appropriate, because gentle and honest people may also have love and hate, and they should also have clear love and hate. Otherwise, if you are gentle and honest, you become a fellow who doesn't know good from bad and doesn't distinguish between enemies and friends. Wouldn't that be an idiot? There is no such reason. Therefore, it says in the following, "Gentle and honest but not foolish, then he who is deeply versed in poetry." It can be seen that gentleness and honesty have the possibility of foolishness, but there should not be such a deviation.

This poem has a good theme and is expressed very powerfully. I especially pay attention to the distinction between "nobility and baseness" at the end of the poem, and mention "not to be transgressed," which has a chilling and inviolable meaning. The poet's position can be said to be close to the people.

### 说汉乐府诗《羽林郎》

　　说汉乐府诗《羽林郎》
    俞平伯
    编者按：从公历纪元前一百年左右起，乐府机关里担任起一个重要的工作，到各地的民间去采集民歌。这工作的收获相当丰富，使汉代人民不少的创作得以流传下来。这些民歌被称为《乐府诗》，成为中国文学里一部珍贵的遗产。它们在一定程度上反映了当时人民的生活，表达了当时人民的思想与情感，并且继承了诗经以来中国文学优良的传统，不断地影响着后代的与人民接近的诗人。给这些民歌一个适当的解释，对于我们仍然是需要的。本文所谈的《羽林郎》即乐府诗中的一首。
    汉魏以来所传的乐府歌词，是多多少少能够申诉人民大众的疾苦的，所谓“饥者歌其食，劳者歌其事”（公羊传何休注），“男女有不得其所者，因相与歌咏各言其伤”，（汉书食货志）可为证明。有些材料却被政府机关采集保存起来。象西汉武帝时所立的《乐府》，规模庞大，人员多至八百，所采的歌词曲谱遍于全国各地，在汉书艺文志上有明白的记载，可惜多散佚了。现今所传的乐府诗多东汉的作品，两汉采诗的情形大概是差不多的。
    《羽林郎》和《陌上桑》的主题十分相象，都写一个女子反抗强暴，不过读羽林郎诗所得印象似偏于激烈，读陌上桑诗，又觉得它很轻描淡写，斗争不很尖锐，其实两诗所表现的女主角，态度的坚决，措词的温婉而又严正，实完全相同，不过表现的技巧不同罢了。本文只谈《羽林郎》。
    “昔有霍家奴，姓冯名子都，依倚将军势，调笑酒家胡。胡姬年十五 ，春日独当垆，长裾连理带，广袖合欢襦，头上蓝田玉，耳后大秦珠。两
    鬟何窈窕，一世良所无，一鬟五百万，两鬟千万余。不意金吾子，娉婷过我庐，银鞍何煜烨爚，翠盖空踟蹰。就我求清酒，丝绳提玉壶；就我求珍肴，金盘鲙鲤鱼。贻我青铜镜，结我红罗裾。不惜红罗裂，何论轻贱躯。男儿爱后妇，女子重前夫，人生有新故，贵贱不相窬。多谢
    金吾子，私爱徒区区。”这虽似乎说西汉的故事，却是东汉的诗，所谓“陈古刺今”与三百篇之义相合。所谓霍家，即大将军霍光，东汉人说西汉，故曰“昔”。事实上指的是东汉和帝时大将军窦宪或执金吾窦景。开首四句，诗意已确定了。那时的恶霸势力从这诗看来有两种，一是豪门贵戚，又一是特务，二者更互相钩结着。诗题为羽林郎，诗文曰金吾子，注家说羽林郎属南军，中尉即执金吾属北军，但无论南军或北军，都是皇帝的侍卫，狗腿子，毫无疑问。至于霍家窦家如何纵容奴仆，均见两汉书，今各引一段。
        “初，光爱幸监奴冯子都，常与计事，及显寡居与子都乱。……使苍
    头奴上朝谒，莫敢谴者。……后两家奴争道，霍氏奴入御史府，欲蹂（踏
    ）大夫门，御史为叩头谢，乃去。”
                （霍光传）御史大夫在汉朝是副丞相，他且要向家奴磕头赔罪，横暴可想。至于东汉窦家的奴仆闹得尤其厉害，大概就是这诗的本事。窦宪的兄弟叫窦景。
        “景为执金吾，环光禄勋，权贵显赫倾动京都，虽俱骄纵而景为尤甚
    ，奴客缇骑依倚形势，侵陵小人，强夺财货，篡取罪人，妻略妇女，商贾
    闭塞如避寇仇。”      （窦融传）闹得商家要罢市了，下文却说“有司畏懦莫敢举奏，太后闻之，使谒者策免景官”。窦太后不知从那里得的风声，不好不敷衍一下。从这段史文看，除掉皇帝正规的特务军警以外，并有许多奴隶阶级的小特务，附属在豪门，所谓奴客缇骑（穿着丹黄色绸缎的马队）“侵陵小人”，用白话说即欺侮老百姓。诗中所写的实是一个贵戚豪门的恶奴，所谓羽林郎，金吾子不过说说罢了。他怕连那个身份也还差得远哩。他自己既居之不疑，人家自然也不敢不这样称呼他，所以他的身份究属南军或北军，殆无须深考。是否特意要写得南北不分，来表示这个意思，却亦不敢附会。
    他身份虽不高，势力却很大，至少用来欺负一个年方十五的当垆胡姬，绰绰乎有余。所以这诗的后半她的态度无论怎样坚决，但措辞却十分委婉，事实上也不得不如此说；既不得不如此说，就不得不如此写了。这是必须首先认识清楚，方对下文可以了解。因为下文很容易引起误会的特别是这几句：
    “贻我青铜镜，结我红罗裾，不惜红罗裂，何论轻贱躯。”
    假如作这样句读，便错了。“红罗裾”下不宜“，”号，当用“。”号，如上引全文的句读比较妥当。因为骤然把这四句一气读下所得的印象，好象男的在拉扯女的，而女的裂衣而起。果真如此，冲突得过火了。上文表过，她是不敢（或者并非不想）这样得罪“金吾子”的。这样的印象从诗意看，并不十分正确。
    依我的意思，有两个字的训诂必须要弄清楚。这儿只叙我个人之见，不敢说准对，但我也曾跟朋友讨论过。这两个字：一个是结字，一个是裂字。所谓结者并非拉拉扯扯，只是要讨好那女人。结，读如要结之结，结绸缪结同心之结。“贻我青铜镜，结我红罗裾，”对文成义意已完全了，所以该用句号。“贻我”、“结我”本差不多的，不过青铜镜女子所照，红罗裾她所穿着，更深了一层即进了一步，所以“贻”“结”两字亦似平似侧，表现得非凡恰当。再以上四句连读，就更明白了。
        “就我求清酒，丝绳提玉壶；就我求珍肴，金盘鲙鲤鱼。”
    这四句等于下两句，故中用“；”号表示。男所求于女的两样：好酒好菜，给她的亦两样：青镜红罗。红罗可以做裾（长裙之类），故曰“红罗裾”。多一裾字这是押韵的关系。
    从“裂”字看去便可证明男方所给，只是一匹新的红罗。裂读如“新裂齐纨素”之裂（班倢伃怨歌行）。亦读如“裂下鸣机色相射”之裂（杜甫白丝行）正缘把这裂字容易看走了，好象女子裂衣而起，殊不知假如这样，便闹得太凶了。北方话至今还说扯一件衣料，就是这裂字古谊的流传。不过咱们现在说“扯”，每在整匹上扯下一块来；古诗所谓“裂”，是从机上扯下一匹来，看杜甫的话非常明白。这个豪华的羽林郎金吾子要来巴结相好，自然是整匹的红罗，给她几尺几寸短短的一块，岂不寒伧。又《孔雀东南飞》诗中有“三日断五匹”句，断即裂也，也是指整匹说。
    “不惜”两句所以引起误会，不仅关于裂字的解释，句法上亦正有问题，因为这儿省略了两个主词。如把他填上，实为“君不惜红罗裂，妾何论轻贱躯”。把红罗抬得这般贵重，把自己身份贬得这样卑微，仿佛要一口答应，文家所谓欲抑先扬，然后转到下文“男儿爱后妇，女子重前夫，人生有新故，贵贱不相窬”，始坚决拒绝，婉而愈厉。“新故”“贵贱”提得极好。我觉得古诗有许多地方很难直译直解的。
    即以“男儿爱后妇，女子重前夫”为例，在诗本里如质直地讲亦很难懂。金吾子所欢，岂止一个胡姬，为后妇当不成问题；但是，十五岁的姑娘难道就有了前夫么？诗人之意不过说男儿喜新，女子念旧，即“新故”是。当体会诗意，不可拘泥字面。
    “贵贱不相窬”，亦妙。好比说您无论怎样贵重，连所有一匹红罗都了不起；我无论怎样轻贱，连自己躯壳也是很贱的，奈我偏瞧不起您何。你虽喜新，奈我偏念旧何。左思咏史诗，“贵者虽自贵，视之若埃尘。贱者虽自贱，重之若千钧”，正可以借来解释这“不相窬”三字。所以结尾说“多谢金吾子，私爱徒区区”，大有你害单相思不关我事的意思，把上文许多热闹场面说得雪淡冰凉。非常扫兴，痛快之极。
    古诗自以“温柔敦厚”为教（见礼记经解篇），有人就把它跟“爱憎分明”对立起来，我觉得这不一定妥当，因为温柔敦厚，亦未尝不有爱有憎，而且亦正应该爱憎分明。不然，温柔敦厚了就变为不知好歹，不分敌友的家伙岂非白痴，那有这个理。所以在下文又说“温柔敦厚而不愚，则深于诗者也。”可见温柔敦厚自有愚蠢之可能，却不应该有这样的偏差呵。
    这首诗主题选得好，表现亦很有力。我特别注意篇终提出“贵贱”的分别，并说到“不相窬”，自有凛然难犯之意。诗人的立场可以说是接近于人民的。
