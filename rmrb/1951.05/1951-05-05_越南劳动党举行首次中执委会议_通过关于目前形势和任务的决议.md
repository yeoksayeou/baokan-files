    [This report] (Xinhua News Agency) Hanoi, April 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party held its first meeting in mid-March.

    The meeting adopted a resolution on the current situation and tasks. In analyzing the current situation in Vietnam, the resolution pointed out that Vietnam's resistance war is a long-term and arduous war. The Vietnamese people must adhere to the concept of long-term struggle in order to overcome all difficulties and win the final victory. The main factor in this victory is the unity and determination of the Vietnamese people; therefore, we must first rely on the strength of the Vietnamese people themselves.
    The resolution then put forward the following urgent tasks:
    (1) Adhere to the guiding principle of military strategy. This principle is based on the long-term and arduous nature of the war of resistance. Therefore, in combat, the goal must be to eliminate the enemy's main force while maintaining and strengthening the armed forces of the Vietnamese people.
    (2) Step up economic and financial work. Strengthen the Party's leadership in economic and financial matters, increase production, ensure supply, increase income, reduce expenditure, correctly conduct economic and financial struggles against the enemy, and develop trade relations with friendly countries.
    (3) Actively participate in the world peace movement. Link the Vietnamese people's armed resistance war and national construction with the world peace movement, educate the Vietnamese people through the movement to defend world peace, promote their internationalist spirit, and enlighten their political awareness.
    (4) Publicize and implement the resolutions of the National Congress of the Labor Party and the National Congress of Vietnam held for the merger of Viet Lien and Viet Minh. Strengthen the Party ideologically, politically and organizationally, and ensure the unity of all the people to carry out the long-term war of resistance together.
    The resolution concluded: "The Central Committee firmly believes that under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, our Party comrades will overcome all difficulties and complete these tasks together with the people."
