　　Currently, many rural areas have launched movements to establish patriotic pledges, and generally, they have achieved good results. However, many rural areas have not yet started this work, or when establishing patriotic pledges, they have not undergone sufficient deliberation and discussion by the masses, and have not carried out planned organizational work, resulting in formalism and failing to guarantee implementation. The experiences of various rural areas in establishing patriotic pledges have been compiled to provide a reference for places that have not yet established patriotic pledges.

　　First, patriotic pledges should be established after extensive patriotic education, on the basis of raising the political consciousness of the masses, and after mobilizing the masses to undergo thorough ideological deliberation and discussion. Establishing patriotic pledges is a conscious patriotic action of the masses, and it is necessary to prevent taking over everything or issuing compulsory orders. Jixian Village in Anping First District, Hebei Province, and Maofa Village in Kailu Sixth District, Fanshen Village in Eighth District, and Xianfeng Village in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, have provided good experiences in this regard. The patriotic pledge of Jixian Village was formally established after four discussions and revisions by party member meetings and mass meetings on the basis of significant increase in mass hatred for the United States and patriotic sentiment after current affairs forums, accusation meetings, and demonstrations. Therefore, the masses of the village can well abide by and implement the pledge. Maofa Village, Fanshen Village, and Xianfeng Village also formulated their village's patriotic pledges under similar circumstances, so the masses attached great importance to them and could also guarantee their implementation. In contrast, the patriotic pledges of Dianxia Village in Xuancheng County and Wuyang District in Shexian County, Southern Anhui Province, were not established in this way. The patriotic pledge of Dianxia Village was copied by the land reform work team from another village, and the masses did not know anything about the patriotic pledge. The patriotic pledge of Wuyang District was copied by farmer representatives who attended a meeting in the district and saw the patriotic pledge posted on the wall of the district office. They read it at a mass meeting without deliberation or discussion by the masses, and then wrote it on the wall. A similar situation also existed in Xiguan Village in Anping First District, Hebei. As a result, they all became mere formalities.

　　Second, the content of patriotic pledges should include both political tasks and specific tasks, and should be closely integrated with the current work in rural areas and the immediate interests of the masses. At the same time, the articles of the pledge should be concise and clear, not complicated, so that the masses can easily memorize and understand them. For example, the most prominent feature of the patriotic pledges of Maofa Village in Kailu County and Xianfeng Village in Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia, is that they are closely linked to current production work, and their content is specific and feasible. One of the articles is to strictly supervise the labor and production of landlords, ensure that militiamen are on guard duty on time, and inspect bad people. In this way, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, which the masses are concerned about, is specifically combined with the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, providing a strong guarantee for the patriotic production movement. Another example is the patriotic pledge of Jixian Village in Anping County, Hebei Province, which has the article "Actively prepare the land, plant more cotton, and increase national strength," which is very suitable for the current work in the area and is related to the immediate interests of the masses. As a result, the masses have taken active action, plowing 230 mu of land and harrowing 735 mu in six days, and planting a total of 320 mu of cotton in the village. The farmers realize that increasing production is patriotism and resistance to the United States and aiding Korea. The patriotic pledge of the Majiazhuang Farmers' Association in the suburbs of Xi'an is also well formulated. Its articles are: 1. Organize men and women to exchange labor to ensure that wheat is hoeed twice, and also help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; 2. Respond to the government's decision to ban Yiguandao and ensure that no bad people are harbored in the village; 3. Ensure that each household plants five trees, and also complete the tree planting task of the Li Hui East Branch Canal; 4. The public grain for 1951 will be delivered to the granary on time, ensuring that the wheat grains are clean.

　　But on the other hand, we must also pay attention not to make the patriotic pledge a purely production pledge that is divorced from politics simply for the sake of simplicity. Like the patriotic pledge of Bancheng Village in Sixiang, Baiding District, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, the entire content is only two sentences: "Finish harvesting the wheat within three days, and dry and winnow it." Such a pledge completely loses its political significance.

　　Third, in addition to establishing common patriotic pledges at the county and township levels, rural patriotic pledges should focus on establishing them by village, by farmers' association group, by mutual aid group, and by family. The advantage of establishing patriotic pledges in this way is that the content is easily specific and can guarantee implementation. In particular, it is easier for each member of the family to abide by the patriotic pledge established in the family. Chen Yushan, chairman of the Wufeng Township Sixth Village Farmers' Association in Nanchong, Northern Sichuan Province, after serious discussion in a family meeting, his eldest son guaranteed to participate in the work exchange team; to help military属王何氏 (family member of a soldier named Wang He) with production; and not to leave one mu of land uncultivated. The second son guaranteed to do a good job as a militia member, intensify his sentry duty, and prevent special agents and bandits from operating; and also carry two loads of manure to the streets every day. The eldest daughter-in-law guaranteed to feed the pigs and cattle well; and cut five ? of grass every day. The second daughter-in-law challenged her sister-in-law, who used to cut two ? of grass, but now cuts four ? of grass; and collects ten jin of manure every day. The old woman said: "I will not lag behind either. Cooking meals and taking care of two grandchildren at home is my business, so you don't have to worry about it." They also formulated a family production plan, stipulating a family meeting every five days, where those who do well are praised and those who do badly are criticized. Because Chen Yushan's family production plan was well formulated, more than 30 households in the village learned from his family and also formulated family resistance to America and aid Korea production plans.

　　Fourth, after the patriotic pledge is established, it should be carefully checked and promptly supervised. Shifeng Village in Xinfan County, Western Sichuan Province, has provided a good method in this regard. After the patriotic pledge was established in the village, some cadres and farmers did not seriously implement it. The farmers in the village heard that other villages were doing well and complained that their own village was lagging behind. When the Xinfan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspected the implementation of the patriotic pledge in the village, it discovered the above-mentioned problems and convened a meeting of village cadres and activists to decide to mobilize all the farmers in the village to compare crops, compare the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and compare the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in accordance with the patriotic pledge. During the comparison, models who implemented the patriotic pledge were commended. As a result, all the farmers in the village learned from the models and took active action. Every day before dawn, many people went to work in the fields, and in less than three days, all the diseased ears of wheat in the village were removed. The work of guarding the night, protecting the warehouse, chasing rumors, and resisting America and aiding Korea propaganda has been further advanced.

　　怎样领导农村居民订立爱国公约？
    冯鲁仁
    目前已有不少农村展开了订爱国公约的运动，一般收到了很好的效果。但是，也有许多农村尚未展开这一工作，或者在订爱国公约时，没有经过群众充分酝酿讨论，没有进行有计划的组织工作，以致流于形式，无法保证执行。现将各地农村订爱国公约的经验整理出来，以供尚未订立爱国公约的地方参考。
    首先，爱国公约应在广泛进行爱国教育之后，在群众政治觉悟提高的基础上，发动群众经过充分的思想酝酿讨论，订立出来。订爱国公约是群众自觉的爱国行动，必须防止包办代替或强迫命令。河北省安平一区集贤村和内蒙开鲁六区茂发村、八区翻身村，通辽先锋村在这方面都提供了很好的经验。集贤村的爱国公约是在经过时事座谈、控诉集会、游行示威，群众仇美爱国情绪有显著增长的基础上，经过党员会、群众会的四次讨论修正才正式订立的。因此，该村群众对公约都能很好地遵守执行。茂发村、翻身村、先锋村也都是在类似这种情形下制订全村的爱国公约的，所以群众都很重视，也能保证执行。与此相反，皖南区宣城县殿下村和歙县深度区武阳小区的爱国公约就不是这样订立的。殿下村的爱国公约是由土地改革工作组照着另外一村抄来的，群众根本就不知道爱国公约这回事。武阳小区的爱国公约是农民代表到区里开会时，见区公所墙上贴着爱国公约，就抄回来召开群众大会读了一遍，亦未经群众酝酿讨论，就写在墙上。河北安平一区西关村也有类似情形。结果，都流于形式。
    其次，爱国公约的内容要包括政治任务和具体任务两个方面，要和农村当前工作与群众切身利益紧密结合。同时，公约条文要简洁明了，不要繁杂，使群众容易背诵和了解。例如内蒙开鲁县茂发村、通辽县先锋村的爱国公约，最突出的特点是它们紧密地结合当前的生产工作，内容具体可行。其中有一条是严格监视地主劳动生产，保证民兵按时站岗放哨，检查坏人。这样就把群众所关心的镇压反革命工作和群众的爱国热情具体结合了起来，使爱国生产运动有了有力的保障。又如河北安平县集贤村的爱国公约中有“积极整地，多种棉花，增加国家力量”一条，很切合当地当前工作，又联系了群众的切身利益，因而群众就积极行动起来，六天耕地二百三十亩，打耙地七百三十五亩，全村共种棉花三百二十亩。农民们都认识到增加生产就是爱国，就是抗美援朝。西安市郊马家庄农会的爱国公约也订得很好，它的条文是：一、组织男女变工，保证麦锄两次，还要帮助烈军工属；二、响应政府取缔一贯道的决定，保证村里不窝藏坏人；三、保证每户植树五棵，同时还要完成澧惠东支渠的植树任务；四、一九五一年的公粮按时缴送入仓，保证麦粒干净。
    但另方面也要注意不要仅仅为了简单而使爱国公约成为脱离政治的单纯的生产公约。像陕西兴平县百定区四乡半个城村的爱国公约，全部内容只有两句话：“三天内收完麦，并且把它晒干、扬净。”这样的公约是完全失掉了政治意义的。
    第三，农村中的爱国公约，除以县、乡为单位订立共同的爱国公约外，应着重以一个村子、一个农会小组、一个互助组、一个家庭为单位来订立。这样订爱国公约的好处是内容容易具体，能够保证执行。特别是在家庭中订立爱国公约更加容易为家庭中每个成员遵守。川北区南充舞凤乡六村农会主席陈玉山全家经家庭会议认真讨论后，他的大儿保证参加变工队；帮助军属王何氏生产；不荒一亩地。二儿保证做好自卫队员的工作，加紧站岗放哨，防备特务土匪活动；每天还上街挑粪两挑。大儿媳保证喂好猪、牛；每天割草五?。二儿媳向嫂子挑战，过去割草二?，现在割草四?；每天检粪十斤。老太婆说：“我也不落后，家里煮饭带两个孙子算我的事，不用你们操心。”他们还订了全家生产计划，规定五天开家庭会议一次，谁做得好就表扬，坏的批评。因为陈玉山家庭生产计划订得好，该村有三十多户都向他家学习，也都订出家庭抗美援朝生产计划。
    第四，爱国公约订立后，要认真检查，及时督促。川西区新繁县世丰村在这方面提供了很好的办法。该村订立爱国公约后，有些干部和农民没有认真执行。该村农民听说别村搞得好，就埋怨自己村落了后。中共新繁县委会检查该村执行爱国公约的情况时，发现了上述问题，便召开村干部和积极分子会议，决定根据爱国公约发动全村农民来进行评比庄稼、评比抗美援朝的宣传工作，评比镇压反革命的工作。评比时，表扬了执行爱国公约的模范。结果，全村农民都向模范学习，积极行动起来了。每天天麻麻亮就有很多人上田里劳动，不到三天，全村所有麦田的病穗都拔光了。守夜、护仓、追谣言和抗美援朝宣传等工作都进了一步。
