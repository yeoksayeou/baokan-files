　　The Puyang County State-owned Farm in Pingyuan Province has achieved good results by promoting agricultural technology through mutual aid teams. This year, the farm's technology promotion work in the county has paid special attention to close integration with mutual aid teams. They first selected five mutual aid teams as pilot projects. As a result of the experiment, the cotton fields of all five mutual aid teams were sown using the new cultivation methods of deep plowing, fine harrowing, and concentrated fertilization. All seeds were of the superior S cotton variety and were selected and treated with soaking and mixing. At the same time, the sowing methods of these five mutual aid teams also changed from the old habits, appropriately widening the distance between rows and shortening the distance between plants, so that topdressing and pest control could be carried out during cotton growth.

　　The county farm used two methods to guide mutual aid teams in improving technology: one was to send people from the mutual aid teams to the farm to learn the production techniques urgently needed by the group; the other was to send technicians from the farm to the mutual aid teams to provide roving guidance and assistance. After learning cotton planting techniques, the farmers of the mutual aid teams not only tried it out in their own group but also provided technical guidance to cotton farmers throughout the village. Mao Gang Village has many alkaline lands. The Mao Xicun mutual aid team in the village sent a member, Mao Xiurang, to the farm to learn the method of planting cotton in alkaline land and first tried it in their own group. After the success, farmers throughout the village generally requested to learn this technology, and the village established a village technology committee to promote it universally. The Dong Mingke mutual aid team in Baiyige Village learned the seed soaking technique. After soaking all the cotton seeds of the group, they helped 20 cotton farmers in the village soak more than 100 catties of cotton seeds.

　　The combination of the farm and the mutual aid team has made the mutual aid team the grassroots force and core organization for the farm to promote technology. The speed and scale of promotion are several times greater than the previous method of relying only on individual contracted farmers. Moreover, because the mutual aid team has sufficient labor, livestock, and land, and also has the financial resources to purchase pesticides and machinery, the conditions for promotion are more convenient than in the past, so the achievements are great. For example, last year the county farm sold a total of 500 catties of S cotton seeds. This spring, in addition to selling all the 2,500 catties of S cotton seeds propagated by the farm, it also sold more than 1,000 catties of S cotton seeds on behalf of the supply and marketing cooperative.

　　After receiving specific guidance from the farm, the mutual aid teams not only improved their technology, but also consolidated and developed the mutual aid teams themselves. Each of the five mutual aid teams under the guidance of the farm has newly purchased a sprayer for pest control and a thermometer for soaking seeds. Some farmers who had not joined the mutual aid team, seeing the benefits of the mutual aid team's technological improvement, asked to join the mutual aid team; many other farmers also asked to organize themselves to learn technology.

### 平原省濮县农场与互助组结合推广技术效率提高

　　平原省濮县农场与互助组结合推广技术效率提高
    平原省濮县公营农场通过互助组推广农业技术，效果良好。该县农场今年技术推广工作，特别注意了与互助组的密切结合，他们首先有重点地选择了五个互助组作实验。实验结果，五个互助组的棉田全部用深耕细耙、集中施肥的新耕作方法播种，种籽全部用的斯字棉优良品种，且都经过粒选与浸拌。同时这五个互助组的播种方法也改变了老习惯，适当加宽行与行间距离，缩短株与株间距离，以便在棉花生长中间施追肥和除虫等。
    该县农场在指导互助组提高技术方面，运用了两种方法：一种是由互助组派人到农场学习本组迫切需要的生产技术；一种是由农场派技术人员到各互助组巡回指导与帮助。互助组的农民在学会植棉技术后，不但在本组试行，并对全村棉农进行技术指导。毛岗村有很多碱地，该村毛希存互助组，就派组员毛修让到农场学习碱地植棉法，先在本组试种。成功后，全村农民普遍要求学习这种技术，该村就成立了村技术委员会，普遍推广。白衣阁村董明珂互助组，学会了浸种技术，他们浸完全组的棉种后，又帮助该村二十户棉农浸棉种一百多斤。
    农场与互助组的结合，使互助组变成了农场推广技术的基层力量和核心组织，推广的速度和规模，比过去只依托单干特约农户的方法超过几倍。又因互助组有充足的劳力、畜力和土地，又有财力购置农药器械，在推广的条件上也较过去方便，因而成绩很大。如去年该县农场共推销斯字棉种五百斤，今年春季，除将该场繁殖的两千五百斤斯字棉种完全推销完外，又代供销合作社推销斯字棉种一千余斤。
    互助组得到农场的具体指导后，不但提高了技术，且互助组本身也得到巩固与发展。农场指导下的五个互助组，每组都新买了一架除虫用的喷雾器和一个浸种用的温度表。有些未参加互助组的农民，看到互助组提高技术的好处，纷纷要求参加互助组；另有许多农民也要求组织起来学习技术。
