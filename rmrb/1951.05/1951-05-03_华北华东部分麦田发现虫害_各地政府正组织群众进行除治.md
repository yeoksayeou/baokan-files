Insect Pests Discovered in Wheat Fields in Parts of North and East China
Local Governments are Organizing the Masses to Eliminate Them

Around the time of the Qingming Festival, crop insect pests successively occurred in some provinces and regions of North and East China. Local people's governments have actively organized the masses to eliminate them. Currently, wheat seedlings are affected by red spider mites in Renqiu and Anping counties of Hebei, and in eight counties including Xiaoxian and Yingshang in the northern Anhui area. Among them, in Xinzhongyi and other seven villages in the third district of Renqiu County, more than 14,000 mu of wheat fields have been affected. Wheat seedlings are being eaten by wireworms in seven counties including Yuxian County in Henan Province, four counties including Dongming and Juancheng in Pingyuan Province, and Zichuan County in Shandong. For example, in Shenli Village, Yuxian County, more than 3,000 mu of wheat seedlings have been bitten to death, accounting for 30 percent of the total wheat area. In addition, soil locusts have occurred in Canshan, Peixian, Muping, Rushan in Shandong, Anyang in Pingyuan Province, and Yichuan in Henan Province. Among them, approximately more than 40,000 mu of wheat fields in Peixian County have been affected by insect pests. In the spring wheat areas of Jixian, Ninghe, Wuqing and Yutian counties in Hebei Province, chironomids are widely eating wheat seedlings. A large number of wheat sawflies have been found in Zou Village, Pixian County, Shandong Province. Furthermore, rice stem borers have been found in Longxi, Fujian Province, and cotton aphids have been found in Anyang, Pingyuan Province, beginning to breed on sow thistle.

After receiving reports of insect pests in the above-mentioned areas, the people's governments in various places have immediately dispatched cadres to the affected areas to organize the masses to carry out prevention and control.
