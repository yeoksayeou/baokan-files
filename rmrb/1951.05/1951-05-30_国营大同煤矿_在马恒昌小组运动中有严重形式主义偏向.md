　　State-Owned Datong Coal Mine
    Has Serious Formalistic Deviations in the Ma Hengchang Group Movement
    To the Editor:
    The Ma Hengchang group competition movement in the state-owned Datong Coal Mine has not been carried out deeply and universally. Out of a total of 424 production groups in the entire mine, only 116 groups responded to the challenge, and only 60 percent of the responding groups met the challenge conditions. Why hasn't the movement been widely carried out? The main reasons are:
    (1) The trade union committee's publicity, education, and assistance to the groups are poor, and the workers' understanding of the Ma Hengchang group is insufficient. When the Datong Coal Mine first launched the Ma Hengchang group competition movement, most factories and mines neither deeply publicized the significance of the competition nor widely organized employees to learn from the experience of the Ma Hengchang group; they only held one or two meetings of cadres or worker representatives to call on everyone to respond to the challenge. Therefore, many workers did not understand the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group, and many deviations occurred when responding to the challenge. Some workers challenged the Ma Hengchang group in their own name. Some did not understand that the Ma Hengchang group competition is a regular patriotic labor competition movement and thought it was a shock like before. For example, Zhang Fuzheng, a worker from the Third Mine, proposed that the deadline for challenging the Ma Hengchang group was May 1. This shows that the trade union lacked necessary publicity for this movement in advance. The challenge conditions of some groups are very unspecific, and it is difficult to achieve results after responding to the challenge. For example, the Cui Diange group of the First Mine included in its challenge conditions "guaranteeing the completion of the existing major projects of the mine" and "resolutely responding to the call of the higher authorities, studying technology every day, and eliminating illiteracy." What exactly are the major projects? How is illiteracy to be eliminated? There is no specific method. For example, the challenge conditions of the sixth and seventh coal areas of the Wajinwan Mine are "doing a good job in publicity, improving production efficiency, and improving cultural level." To what extent will production efficiency be improved? How to improve the cultural level? They don't even have a number in their minds, and it is difficult to check later. Even more, some responding groups perfunctorily write a few challenge conditions, and once they hand them over to the trade union and the newspaper, they are done. They don't even leave a copy for themselves. After a few days, the group itself doesn't even know what they proposed. In addition, the leadership does not have a set of regular inspection system, and the movement completely becomes formalistic.
    (2) When the responding groups have difficulties and deviations, the trade union does not solve and correct them in time, and even the energetic ones slack off. For example, the challenge conditions of the Han Rirong group of the No. 3 well of the Second Mine were originally set very well, but since switching to mechanized coal mining, the machinery has often malfunctioned, and the railway has also had problems, resulting in frequent coal storage. The leadership did not help them solve the problem in time, resulting in a decline in production efficiency and worker unrest. Others, such as Wei Suyuan of the First Mine, Zhang Qingfa of the Second Mine, and Liu Yutong of the Third Mine, were originally first-class models, but because the leading cadres did not grasp tightly and the assistance and education were poor, some were downgraded and some were not rated at all when selecting models in January this year.
    (3) Leading cadres are only satisfied with the production records of a few people and do not study and promote experience in time. Therefore, the responding groups are limited to a few advanced groups, and the other vast groups dare not respond to the Ma Hengchang group. They believe that responding to the challenge is a matter for activists and labor models. For example, the workers of the Yu Delin group of the Machine Factory said: "Our group is so bad, how dare we challenge others!" There are many similar situations. The mining area trade union has now discovered this deviation and is studying ways to correct it.

### 国营大同煤矿  在马恒昌小组运动中有严重形式主义偏向

　　国营大同煤矿
    在马恒昌小组运动中有严重形式主义偏向编辑同志：
    国营大同煤矿的马恒昌小组竞赛运动开展得不够深入和普遍。全矿共四百二十四个生产小组，其中应战的只有一百一十六个小组，完成应战条件的又仅占应战小组的百分之六十。运动为什么没有广泛开展呢？主要是由于：
    （一）工会委员会对小组的宣传、教育和帮助差，工人对马恒昌小组认识不足。大同煤矿刚开展马恒昌小组竞赛运动时，大部分厂矿既没有深入宣传竞赛的意义，又没有广泛地组织职工学习马恒昌小组的经验；只开了一两个干部会或工人代表会号召一下，就让大家起来应战。所以很多工人对马恒昌小组的先进经验不了解，应战时就产生了很多的偏向。有的工人以个人的名义向马恒昌小组应战。有的不了解马恒昌小组竞赛是经常性的爱国劳动竞赛运动，还以为是像从前一样来一个突击。如三矿工人张福正提出向马恒昌小组应战的期限是到五月一日为止。这说明了工会事前对这一运动是缺乏必要的宣传的。有些小组的应战条件非常不具体，应战以后很难收到效果。如一矿崔殿阁小组，应战条件中有“保证将本矿现有主要工程完成”，有“坚决响应上级号召，每日学习技术，消灭文盲”。究竟什么是主要工程呢？文盲怎样消灭呢？也没有个具体办法。如挖金湾矿六、七煤区的应战条件是“作好宣传工作，提高生产效率，提高文化水平。”到底生产效率提高到什么程度？怎样提高文化水平？自己心里也没个数，以后检查就很困难。更有的应战小组马马虎虎地写上几条应战条件，一交给工会和报社就算完事，自己连个底子也不留，过几天本组自己也不知道尽提了些啥，再加上领导没有一套定期检查的制度，运动就完全流于形式主义。
    （二）应战小组有了困难和偏向，工会不及时解决与纠正，劲头足的也松了劲。如二矿三号井韩日荣小组应战条件原来订得很好，但自从改为机械采煤后，机械经常发生故障，铁道也出毛病，以致经常存煤。领导上没有及时帮助他们解决问题，结果生产效率下降，工人情绪不安。其他如一矿魏遂元、二矿张清发、三矿刘玉桐等，原来都是甲等模范，可是因为领导干部抓得不紧，帮助教育差，结果今年一月评选模范时，有的降了级，有的根本没有评上。
    （三）领导干部只满足于少数人的生产纪录，没有及时研究和推广经验。因之应战小组仅限于几个先进小组，其他广大的小组不敢向马恒昌小组应战。他们认为应战是积极分子和劳动模范的事。如机厂宇德林小组的工友们说：“咱们组这样糟，还敢向人家应战！”类似这样的情形很多。矿区工会现已发现这种偏向，正在研究纠正办法。
