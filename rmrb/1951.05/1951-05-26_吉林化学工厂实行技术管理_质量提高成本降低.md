The state-owned Jilin Chemical Plant has made remarkable progress in production since implementing technical management in February of last year. Taking the production of calcium carbide as an example: the task completion rate in the first quarter of last year was 127.2%, and it increased to 187.6% in the fourth quarter; the number of first-class products in the fourth quarter increased threefold compared to the first quarter; the product cost in the fourth quarter decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter. The phosphorus production plant not only successfully completed its task in the first quarter of this year, but also greatly reduced work-related injuries, with the number in March decreasing by more than three-quarters compared to February. Before the first quarter of last year, the plant had no technical management system and relied solely on the experience of veteran workers; technical personnel did not go deep into the field to understand the condition of machinery and equipment, nor did they study the workers' operations. Due to the disconnect between actual operation and theoretical guidance, an explosion occurred in the electric furnace cooling machine of the phosphorus production plant in 1949. After the plant began to implement technical management, technical personnel, based on the operational experience of the workers and after democratic discussion, formulated technical operating procedures and established various systems. Since then, the technical management of the Jilin Chemical Plant has begun to move forward. The plant will further strengthen employee education in the future and more conscientiously implement the various rules and regulations of technical management.

　　吉林化学工厂实行技术管理
    质量提高成本降低
    国营吉林化学工厂自去年二月实行技术管理以后，生产有突出的进展。以所产电石为例：去年第一季完成任务百分之一百二十七点二，第四季就提高到百分之一百八十七点六；一等品第四季比第一季提高了三倍；第四季比第一季产品成本降低了百分之九。该厂制磷场今年第一季不仅顺利地完成了任务，而且公伤人员亦大大减少，三月份比二月份减少了四分之三还多。在去年第一季以前，该厂没有技术管理制度，只凭老工人经验办事；技术人员不深入现场了解机械设备的情况，不研究工人的操作。由于实际操作和理论指导的脱节，以致一九四九年制磷场电炉冷却机发生了爆炸事故。该厂开始实行技术管理以后，技术人员根据工人操作经验，又经过民主讨论，拟订了技术操作规程，并建立了各项制度，自此，吉林化学工厂的技术管理开始向前迈进。该厂今后将进一步加强职工教育，更加认真地贯彻技术管理的各项规程制度。
