Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The American aggressors are once again inhumanely using captured Korean People's Army soldiers for germ weapon experiments. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island, Korea, on the 18th, the US aggressor troops' Bacterial Landing Craft No. 1091 is currently engaging in this heinous activity on Geoje Island, forty miles southwest of Busan, Korea.

This landing craft carried American germ warfare criminals in March to conduct inhumane experiments with germ weapons on captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers in Wonsan Harbor, North Korea. Brigadier General Sames, Director of the "Public Health Bureau" of the US aggressor troops' headquarters, was awarded the "Cross Medal" for this.

According to the Associated Press, this germ ship "has a modern laboratory," "equipped with incubators, microscopes, sterilizers, refrigerators, distillation equipment, and everything else needed by the scientists on board."

After its activities in Wonsan, this wicked ship was immediately dispatched to Geoje Island. According to the Associated Press, there are "half a dozen corrals" on this island, imprisoning captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army. The purpose of the ship's arrival on Geoje Island is to use the captured Korean People's Army soldiers as test subjects for germ weapons. The Associated Press stated that the ship's "laboratory extends from the POW camp on Geoje Island, obtaining cultures of bacteria from the mouth and intestines, conducting three thousand tests every day." The ship's "twenty-foot square laboratory is crowded, and all thirty-eight people are working at full capacity."

The Associated Press admits that these heinous germ warfare criminals "are not unaware of the anger they are causing"; however, they shamelessly believe that the work they are doing now is "more important than notoriety."

　　侵朝美军惨无人道
    又以朝人民军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国侵略者又惨无人道地以朝鲜人民军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验。据美联社朝鲜巨济岛十八日电透露：侵朝美军的第一零九一号细菌登陆艇，现在朝鲜釜山西南四十英里的巨济岛从事这项罪恶活动。
    这一登陆艇曾于三月间载着美国细菌战犯在朝鲜北部元山港灭绝人性地以中国人民志愿军被俘人员试验细菌武器。侵朝美军司令部“公共卫生局”局长赛姆斯准将，曾因而获得了“十字勋章”。
    据美联社透露：在这只细菌船上，“设有一个现代化的实验室”，“装备了孵育器、显微镜、消毒器、冷藏器、蒸馏设备以及船上的科学家们所需要的其他一切装备。”
    这只罪恶的船在到元山活动后，随即被派到巨济岛。据美联社透露：在这个岛上有“半打圈栏”，囚禁着朝鲜人民军的被俘人员。该船到巨济岛去的目的，就是要以朝鲜人民军被俘人员作为细菌武器的试验品。美联社称：船上的“实验室自伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营，取得口与肠的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验”。该船“二十英尺见方的实验室已挤得满满的，全体三十八个人都在全力地工作着。”
    美联社承认：这些万恶的细菌战罪犯“并不是不知道他们所引起的愤怒”；但是，他们却无耻地认为，他们现在所做的工作，比“恶名更为重要”。
