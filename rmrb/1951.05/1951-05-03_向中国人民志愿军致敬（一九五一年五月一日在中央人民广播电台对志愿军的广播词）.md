Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in Korea! Comrades of the stretcher teams, transport teams, medical teams, and other related work comrades working on the Korean front! I now represent the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, to pay you the highest respect, to pay you cordial greetings!

Comrades, you have worked hard! The high degree of self-sacrifice, the high degree of combination of patriotism and internationalism, and the high degree of revolutionary humanitarianism you have shown have set a brilliant example for all the Chinese people and promoted the power of justice for the people of the world. All the Chinese people are grateful to you, and all the kind people in the world are grateful to you.

You have been participating in the battle for six months, constantly giving the enemy heavy blows. As of April 21, you have annihilated more than 133,000 enemy troops, driven the enemy from the Yalu River to south of the 38th parallel, beaten the enemy into a state of chaos, beaten the enemy to pieces, and frightened the enemy out of their wits as soon as they hear the name of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Comrades, at present, the internal affairs of the American imperialists have become a mess, and the relations between the United States, Britain, and France within the aggressive bloc have also become disintegrated. In order to shirk the responsibility for the failure and to mend the internal contradictions, Truman of the United States was forced to remove MacArthur from his post on April 11. This is undoubtedly the result of the efforts of the comrades and a brilliant achievement in the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people.

The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people is a common victory for the people of the world. This great victory has struck a blow to the enemy's arrogant arrogance and encouraged the democratic and peace camp's confidence in victory. The paper tiger of American imperialism has been punctured by you, and you have punctured holes of all sizes all over its body. In the minds of the people of the world, the backward ideas of worshiping the United States, trusting the United States, and fearing the United States have been gradually eliminated, and replaced by the progressive ideas of being hostile to the United States, despising the United States, and scorning the United States.

Comrades, your achievements are of great significance. You have caused the enemy's war policy of aggression against the world to suffer a serious setback, not only helping the Korean brothers to gain liberation, not only defending the security of the motherland, consolidating the national defense of the motherland, but also preventing the expansion of the war of aggression and ensuring the security of the Far East and the security of the world. Your achievements will leave an indelible and glorious page in the history of the progress of all mankind.

However, comrades, you know very well that the enemy, especially the American imperialists, have not yet learned the lessons they deserve from the failure, and the enemy has not given up. They are still continuing the hopeless war of aggression against Korea, which only leads to a dead end, and are also frantically increasing military budgets, increasing military production, and stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan, trying to make all kinds of preparations to realize their criminal attempt to re-launch a world war. In order to collect a large amount of military spending and cannon fodder, American imperialism is also carrying out large-scale deceptive propaganda today, reversing black and white, confusing right and wrong, and arbitrarily fabricating rumors and slanders; slandering our ally—the Soviet Union, which has always adhered to a peaceful policy—as an "aggressor country," and slandering our People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in Korea, while whitewashing its own aggressive acts as "legitimate defense." In this way, it wants to deceive the people within the aggressive bloc, deceive the people of West Germany and Japan, and deceive the people of the world, and vainly attempt to further expand the war of aggression.

Comrades, this is the reality we are facing today. Under such a situation, how should we Chinese people further demonstrate our strength? Without a doubt, we should first strengthen our patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, so that our movement becomes more popular, in-depth, and sustained, so that every place and everyone in China can receive patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea, and can actively express patriotic actions. Everyone should resist America and aid Korea, everyone should consolidate national defense, and everyone should support our comrades fighting on the front lines in Korea, giving the enemy heavier blows and driving them all out of Korea.

Today, we are vigorously promoting the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea throughout the country. We are holding votes against the rearmament of Japan and signing petitions demanding that the five major powers (China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France) conclude a peace treaty. We must not only unite all the Chinese people to resist American imperialism, but also unite all the peace-loving people of the world to jointly resist American imperialism.

May Day is a common festival for the working people of the world to unite and fight. Today, large-scale demonstrations and parades are being held in all cities and villages across the country to support the comrades fighting on the front lines in Korea, to oppose the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism, to smash the criminal plan of American imperialism to prepare for a unilateral peace treaty with Japanese militarists, to prevent the expansion of the war of aggression, and to defend the lasting peace of the world.

The movement to comfort the Volunteer Army is also being vigorously promoted throughout the country. The people of the whole country have expressed great enthusiasm in this movement, and cash and comfort items are being donated like a flood. As of April 21, the amount of RMB donated in cash alone from all over the country to the Beijing General Association has reached more than 90 billion. Currently, we are preparing to promote it further. The compatriots all over the country are prepared to take out everything they can to strive for a complete victory in the just war against aggression being waged on the front lines in Korea.

Comrades, we are already engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the aggressive bloc today. Why should we also hold a signing movement demanding that the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, conclude a peace treaty? This is the most important resolution passed by the World Peace Council's Berlin Conference in February, requiring the people of the world to hold it jointly. The main purpose is to expose the deception of the aggressive bloc.

The aggressive bloc slanders our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, as "aggressor countries," using this to deceive the general public, to cover up its own aggression, and as a preparatory step for expanding the war. We must expose this enormous deception in front of the people of the world, and simply and directly test for the people of the world which government or governments are the real aggressors.

Regarding the demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty, the governments and people of our two major countries, China and the Soviet Union, completely agree, and there is no problem. The problem lies with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, the countries of the aggressive bloc. If the reactionary governments of those countries still refuse as usual, then wouldn't their true colors be exposed in front of the people of the world?

If the people of the world are less deceived, the aggressive bloc's conspiracy to expand the war cannot be realized. In this way, we can hollow out the enemy's foundation, reduce the military spending and cannon fodder of the aggressive bloc by one point, and increase the strength of the peace camp by one point; the lasting peace of the world can be finally guaranteed.

The international movement to defend world peace and our patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea are inseparable. Therefore, while strengthening the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, we must also support the various resolutions of the World Peace Council and hold a signing petition demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty.

Comrades, the strength of the world peace camp is incomparably strong. In particular, the unity of the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated. At the invitation of the Soviet people, the Chinese People's Observation Group headed by Comrade Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, went to the Soviet Union to participate in the May Day Labor Day celebrations. It has arrived in Moscow and has been warmly welcomed by the Soviet people.

The internal unity of our China is also becoming increasingly consolidated. Mr. Bainqen Erdini, the Panchen Lama of Tibet, led a delegation of 45 people to Beijing on April 27, warmly expressing support for Chairman Mao and supporting the Central People's Government's policy of peaceful settlement of the Tibet issue. The negotiating delegation sent by Lhasa has also arrived in Beijing one after another. Therefore, the solution of the Tibet issue is only a matter of time.

These Tibetan delegations participated in the grand May Day Labor Day celebrations held in Beijing today. At this great festival, also participating in the observation ceremony were representatives of the International Student Union, a delegation sent by the Polish people to Korea to express their condolences, and a delegation sent by the British people to China.

The great unity of the people of the world presented the most concentrated manifestation on May Day Labor Day in Moscow and Beijing.

Comrades, let the aggressive bloc tremble in the face of the power of our people!

I wish you continued success on the front lines, and use continuous and more brilliant victories to strike the enemy and inspire the fighting spirit of the people of the world!

Comrades, please rest assured at the same time that all our compatriots will take you as an example, combine the same high degree of patriotism and internationalism, jointly exert the high degree of self-sacrificing spirit, strive to support the front lines, strive to do all the work in their own posts well, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, closely strengthen domestic unity and international unity, and rapidly build our country into a strong fortress of peace like the Soviet Union.

Long live the victory of the world peace and democracy camp!
Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
Long live the immortal fraternal friendship and common great victory of the Chinese and Korean people!
Long live the great People's Republic of China!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　向中国人民志愿军致敬
  （一九五一年五月一日在中央人民广播电台对志愿军的广播词）
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席  郭沫若
    在朝鲜和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军全体同志们！在朝鲜前线工作着的全体担架队员同志们！运输队员同志们！医疗队员同志们！以及其它有关的工作同志们！我现在代表中国人民抗美援朝总会，向你们致崇高的敬礼，向你们致亲切的慰问！
    同志们，你们辛苦了！你们所表现的高度的自我牺牲的精神，高度的爱国主义与国际主义的结合，高度的革命的人道主义，为我们全中国人民树立了辉煌的模范，为全世界人民发扬了正义的威力。全中国人民都在感谢你们，全世界善良的人们也都在感谢你们。
    你们参加作战以来已经六个月，连续不断地给予了敌人以沉重的打击。到四月二十一日止，你们已经歼灭了敌人十三万三千多人，把敌人从鸭绿江边赶到了三八线以南，打得敌人鸡飞狗跳，打得敌人落花流水，打得敌人只要听到中国人民志愿军的名号便骇得魂飞天外了。
    同志们，目前在美帝国主义者的内部已经闹得一塌糊涂，在侵略集团内部美英法之间也闹得来分崩离析。为了要推卸失败的责任，为了要弥缝内部的矛盾，美国的杜鲁门被逼得在四月十一日把麦克阿瑟撤职了。这不用说是同志们的努力所得来的结果，是中朝人民的伟大胜利中的一项辉煌的成就。
    中朝人民的伟大胜利是全世界人民的共同胜利。这一伟大胜利打击了敌人的狂妄的气焰，鼓励了民主和平阵营的必胜的信心。美帝国主义这只纸老虎已经被你们戳穿了，已经被你们戳得全身都是大框小洞了。这在全世界人民的心目中，已经把崇拜美帝、亲信美帝、害怕美帝的落后观念逐渐扫除，而代替以敌视美帝、鄙视美帝、蔑视美帝的进步观念。
    同志们，你们的成就是具有伟大的意义的。你们使敌人侵略全世界的战争政策遭受了严重挫折，不仅帮助了朝鲜兄弟获得解放，不仅保卫了祖国的安全，巩固了祖国的国防，同时也制止了侵略战争的扩大，保障了远东的安全和世界的安全。你们的功劳将要在全人类的进步历史上，留下永远不能磨灭的光辉的篇页。
    但是，同志们，你们是知道得很清楚的。敌人，特别是美帝国主义者在今天还没有从失败中得到应有的教训，敌人还没有死心。它们还是在继续着毫无希望的、只有死路一条的侵略朝鲜的战争，而且还在疯狂地增加军事预算，提高军需生产，加紧武装西德和日本，想作种种准备，来实现它重新发动一次世界战争的罪恶企图。为了想搜括大量的军费和炮灰，美帝国主义在今天也正在进行着大规模的欺骗宣传，颠倒黑白，淆乱是非，任意造谣诬蔑；诬蔑我们的盟邦——一贯坚持和平政策的苏联为“侵略国”，诬蔑我们中华人民共和国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”，而把自己的侵略行为粉饰成为“正当防卫”。这样来蒙蔽侵略集团内部的人民，蒙蔽西德和日本的人民，蒙蔽全世界的人民，妄想把侵略战争更进一步地扩大。
    同志们，这是我们当前所面对着的现实。在这样的形势之下，我们中国人民应该怎样来更进一步地表现我们的力量呢？毫无疑问，我们首先就应该加强我们的抗美援朝的爱国运动，使我们这一运动更加普及、深入、持久，要使全中国每一处每一人都接受到抗美援朝的爱国教育，都能够积极地表现出爱国行动。人人都来抗美援朝，人人都来巩固国防，人人都来支援我们在朝鲜前线作战的各位同志们，给予敌人以更沉重的打击，把它们全部驱逐出朝鲜。
    我们今天正在全国各地如火如荼地推进着抗美援朝的爱国运动，我们在举行反对重新武装日本的投票，在举行要求五大国（中、苏、英、美、法）缔结和平公约的签名。我们不仅要团结全中国人民来反抗美帝国主义，同时也要团结全世界爱好和平的人民共同来反抗美帝国主义。
    五一劳动节是我们全世界劳动人民团结奋斗的共同的节日。今天在全国各城市各乡村尽可能地在举行着大规模的示威游行，来支援在朝鲜前线作战的各位同志，来反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，来粉碎美帝国主义准备与日本军国主义者片面媾和的罪恶计划，来防止侵略战争的扩大，来保卫世界的持久和平。
    慰劳志愿军的运动在全国范围内也更加踊跃地在推进着。全国人民在这一运动上表示了高度的热诚，现款和慰劳物品象洪水一样捐献。截至四月二十一日止，单就捐献的现款，从全国各地汇寄到北京总会来的人民币的数目已经达到九百亿以上。目前我们准备还要推进一步。全国的同胞们都准备拿出自己所能拿出的一切，来争取在朝鲜前线所进行着的反抗侵略的正义战争得到全面胜利。
    同志们，我们今天已经在和侵略集团作生死斗争，为什么同时又要举行要求中、苏、英、美、法五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动呢？这是世界和平理事会二月柏林会议所决定的一项最重要的决议，要求全世界人民来共同举行。这主要的目的就是在揭穿侵略集团的欺骗。
    侵略集团诬蔑我们中苏两国为“侵略国”，拿这来欺骗人民大众，来掩饰自己的侵略，并作为扩大战争的准备步骤。我们就要在全世界人民面前揭穿这个天大的欺骗，简捷了当地为全世界人民考验出到底是那一个或那一些国家的政府才是真正的侵略者。
    对于缔结和平公约的要求，我们中苏两大国的政府和人民是完全同意的，不成问题。问题就在侵略集团的美、英、法那几个国家的政府了。那些国家的反动政府假如还要照例地拒绝，那么在全世界人民面前不就揭露了它们的真正面目了吗？
    全世界人民少受欺骗，侵略集团的扩大战争的阴谋便无法实现。这样来挖空敌人的脚根，使侵略集团的军费和炮灰减少一分，和平阵营的有生力量便增加一分；全世界的持久和平就可以得到最后的保障。
    保卫世界和平的国际运动和我们抗美援朝的爱国运动是分不开来的。因此我们在加强抗美援朝的爱国运动中，同时要拥护世界和平理事会的各项决议，举行要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名。
    同志们，全世界和平阵营的力量是无比地壮大了。特别是中苏两大民族的团结是日趋巩固了。应苏联人民的邀请、到苏联去参加五一劳动节的以中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠同志为首的中国人民观礼团，已经到了莫斯科，受到了苏联人民热烈的欢迎。
    我们中国内部的团结也日趋巩固了。西藏的班禅额尔德尼先生在四月二十七日率领了四十五人所组成的代表团来到了北京，热诚表示拥护毛主席，拥护中央人民政府和平解决西藏问题的政策。拉萨方面所派遣的谈判代表团也先后到了北京。因此，西藏问题的解决只是时间问题了。
    这些西藏的代表团今天都参加了北京举行的盛大的五一劳动节。在这个伟大的节日，参加观礼的还有国际学生联合会的代表们，有波兰人民派遣到朝鲜去慰问的代表团，有英国人民派遣到中国来的代表团。
    全世界人民大团结，在五一劳动节这一天，在莫斯科和北京，呈现出了最集中的表现。
    同志们，我们让侵略集团在我们人民力量的面前发抖吧！
    祝你们在前线再接再厉，用连续不断的更辉煌的胜利来打击敌人，来鼓舞全世界人民的斗志！
    同志们，同时请你们放心，我们全体同胞都要以你们为模范，以同样高度的爱国主义和国际主义的结合，共同将高度的自我牺牲精神，努力支援前线，努力做好自己岗位上的一切工作，坚决镇压反革命，紧密地加强国内的团结和国际的团结，把我们的国家迅速建设成象苏联一样坚强的和平堡垒。
    世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！中国人民志愿军万岁！中朝人民不朽的兄弟友谊和共同的伟大胜利万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
