　　Who Received the Loans?
  　Thorough Inspections Needed in All Areas
    [Our Newspaper, Lincheng News] During this loan inspection, it was discovered that many villages, lacking a class perspective, allowed landlords to cleverly obtain loans, while poor and hired peasants, lacking production funds, could not obtain sufficient capital. Furthermore, some villages did not use the loans for production, but instead used them to buy food and weapons, which violates our purpose of providing loans to support poor and hired peasants in their production. In Lisha Village, out of two loans totaling 320,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan were loaned to four targets of struggle; Zhang Lidong used his 15,000 yuan loan to buy food instead of production; Zhang Qiu Xiao used his 2,000 yuan loan to pay off debts. Looking at the number of households receiving loans, it's roughly equal between poor/hired peasants and middle peasants, but the loan amounts differ greatly. For example, in the October 8th loan distribution, twelve middle peasant households received 130,000 yuan, while fifteen poor/hired peasant households received only 89,000 yuan, proving that the village did not prioritize supporting poor and hired peasants with the loans. In addition, Nihe Village spent 50,000 yuan of loan money to buy guns; Caishou Village even allowed Wu Chun, a target of struggle, to receive a 10,000 yuan loan, and Deputy Village Chief ××× (Editor's note: Comrade Correspondent! Why are we still tolerating such individuals? His name should be revealed to everyone!) even transferred a 10,000 yuan loan to Zhu Linxiang, a target of struggle. The aforementioned irregularities in loan distribution must be strictly corrected. We hope that all districts and villages will strictly inspect our loan programs to determine if similar phenomena exist. (Zhen Wen, Guo Xiang)

　　款都贷给了谁？
  　各地都要深入的检查一下
    【本报临城讯】在这次检查贷款中，发现很多村因为没有阶级观点，叫地主从中取巧贷了款，而缺乏生产资金的贫雇，却贷不到足够的资本，还有的村庄，不把贷款用来生产，随便拿来买粮食买枪用了，这都违背了我们贷款扶植贫雇农民生产的目的。里沙村两次贷款三十二万元，竟让四户斗争对象贷款二万元；张立东贷款一万五千元，不用来生产，都买了粮食吃，张秋小贷款二千元，都还了账。贷款的户数来看，贫雇和中农差不多，但从贷款的数目来看，那就差的太多了。如十月八日的贷款中，十二户中农即贷款十三万元，而十五户贫雇才贷款八万九千元，这证明该村没把贷款有重点的扶植贫雇。另外，泥河村贷款买枪花了五万元；财兽村竟让斗争对象吴春贷款一万元，副村长×××（编者按：通讯员同志！对这样的人还姑息什么？应该把他的名字告诉大家！）竟把贷款转让给斗争对象朱林祥一万元。以上贷款中的不良现象，必须严加纠正，并希望各区各村严格检查我们的贷款，是否有类似现象。（振文、国香）
