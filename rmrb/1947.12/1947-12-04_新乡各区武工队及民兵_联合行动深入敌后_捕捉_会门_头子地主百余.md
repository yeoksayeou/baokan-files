Xinxiang District Armed Work Teams and Militias
    Jointly Operate Deep Behind Enemy Lines
    to Capture Over a Hundred "Secret Society" Leaders and Landlords
[Our newspaper's Yu Bei dispatch] Under the direction of Special Agent Chief Zhou Yi and the township government, landlords and local bullies in Xinxiang villages forced the masses to organize "Joint Village Associations" (gun clubs), levying funds, weapons, grain, and manpower, extorting and blackmailing, committing all kinds of evil deeds, making life unbearable for the common people.
    On the evening of November 18th, our No. 1 District Armed Work Team attacked Nan Zhangmen, capturing two "gun club" sentries and seizing two operable rifles. When the enemy discovered this, they immediately fled south. Our Armed Work Team took advantage of the victory to attack the Xi Zhangmen "secret society," completely eliminating the enemy, killing or wounding two, capturing six alive, and seizing five rifles. On the night of November 21st, the No. 1 District Armed Work Team, in coordination with a unit of the "No. 49 Division," rapidly surrounded and attacked the "gun club" and puppet township government of San Lubao Village. After two hours of fierce fighting, they eliminated the village's "gun club." The Armed Work Team alone killed or wounded three members of the puppet township government, captured four members of the "Joint Village Association," and seized three rifles, one operable rifle, one hundred and forty rounds of ammunition, and three hand grenades. On the night of November 21st, the No. 2, 3, and 4 District Armed Work Teams and a unit of the Shizhuang District Militia jointly penetrated deep behind enemy lines to operate in Dongguo Village (eight li from Xinxiang City) and Yuanzhuang, capturing over ninety people, including the deputy village chief, deputy head of the security team, "secret society" leaders, and landlords. They also killed the squad leader of the Chenbao Township Government and captured a black market gun handler. In the morning, they returned to Dakuaicun and held a mass meeting to distribute the spoils of victory. At this time, they discovered that over forty members of the enemy's "Joint Village Association" were approaching Dakuaicun from Dongguo in two groups. When they entered our ambush circle, our machine guns and grenades fired in unison. The enemy turned around and fled, scrambling and tumbling, jumping over ditches and into the water. Some had their cotton trousers soaked and took them off, running away with their bare bottoms. Our brave soldiers pursued them for three or four li, killing, wounding, or capturing a total of eight, seizing two rifles, three operable rifles, twenty-four bullets, a bugle, and two hand grenades. We suffered no losses and returned to our defenses safely. (Xu Guang, Ge Fei, Qi Hua).

　　新乡各区武工队及民兵
    联合行动深入敌后
    捕捉“会门”头子地主百余
    【本报豫北讯】新乡各村地主恶霸在特务头子周毅及乡公所主持之下，强迫群众组织“联庄会”（枪会），派款派枪，要粮要丁，勒索敲诈，无恶不作，苦害得老百姓实在没法过。
    一区我武工队于十一月十八日晚出击南张门，捕捉“枪会”岗哨两名，缴获一响枪两枝。敌发觉后，当即向南逃窜，我武工队乘胜又出击西张门“会门”，将敌全部解决，毙伤二名，生俘六名，缴步枪五枝。十一月廿一日夜，一区武工队又配合“四九部”一部，以神速行动围击三鲁堡村之“枪会”及伪乡公所，经两小时激战，即将该村“枪会”解决，仅武工队即毙伤伪乡公所三名，俘“联庄会”员四名，缴获步枪三枝，一响枪一枝，子弹一百四十发，手掷弹三个。十一月廿一日夜，二、三、四区武工队及师庄区民兵一部联合深入敌后东郭村（距新乡城八里）袁庄活动，捕捉副保长、保队副“会门”头子地主等九十多人，并击毙陈堡乡公所班长，活捉黑枪手×××。上午返至大块村，又配合开群众大会分配胜利品。这时发现从东郭方向有敌人“联庄会”四十多人分两路向大块村逼来，至我军伏击圈时，我机步枪手榴弹齐鸣，敌人回头就逃，连爬带滚、跳沟跳水，有的棉裤湿了水，脱了光着屁股跑。我勇敢的战士直追三、四里地，计共毙伤俘八名，缴步枪两枝、一响枪三枝、子弹二十四粒、军号一个、手掷弹两个，我无损失，安然返防。（许光、戈飞、启华）。
