　　Protesting the Government's Treasonous Agreement with the U.S.
  　Panama People's Massive Demonstration

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Panama City dispatch: Under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, the Panamanian government signed a humiliating and nation-betraying agreement with the United States on the 10th, allowing U.S. imperialism to control all important military bases within Panama. This move has triggered strong protests and demonstrations from the people throughout Panama. The Panamanian Foreign Minister, Arfa Ro, resigned in anger the day before the signing of the treasonous agreement, and vehemently denounced the unreasonable actions of U.S. imperialism. On the 12th, students from various universities in Panama gathered in Panama City and held a large demonstration march on the main streets to protest the treasonous agreement. They irrepressibly fought back against police interference, leading to multiple clashes and "street fights," resulting in more than 30 casualties. The Panamanian "Patriotic Youth Front" issued a statement calling on the people of the whole country to fight for the abolition of the humiliating agreement.

    【新华社陕北廿二日电】巴拿马城讯：在美帝国主义压力下，巴拿马政府于十日已与美国签订了丧权辱国协定，允许美帝控制巴国境内之一切重要军事基地。此举已引起巴拿马全国人民的强烈抗议示威，巴外长阿发罗于该卖国协定签字前一天，愤而辞职，并痛斥美帝此种无理举动。十二日，巴国各大学学生齐集巴京在各主要街道举行盛大示威游行，抗议该项卖国协定，并怒不可遏地反击警察之干涉以至发生多次冲突和“巷战”，伤亡达三十余人之多。巴国“爱国青年阵线”为此发表声明，号召全国人民为废除辱国协定而奋斗。
