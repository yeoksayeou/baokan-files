Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive report: Where crows gather, there is the stench of corpses. After nearly a month of meetings, the U.S. Special Congress finally passed the so-called "Emergency Aid" bill of $597 million for France, Italy, Austria, and the Chiang bandit group on the 15th. This bill was proposed by Truman on November 17th, precisely when the working classes of France and Italy were holding or brewing unprecedented strikes and demonstrations, and the fate of the reactionary authorities in France and Italy was in a very critical situation. The U.S. imperialist headquarters attempted to use this meager sum with harsh conditions to rescue the reactionary rule of France, Italy, and Austria from peril. However, after the bill was proposed, it aroused strong protests from democratic world public opinion and the American people. Reflected within the U.S. imperialist gang, it manifested as the Republican and Democratic party leaders performing shameless double acts, engaging in verbose mutual debates on the topics of whether to "aid Europe" first or "aid Chiang" first, and whether the loan amount was too "large" or too "small." The so-called amendments proposed reached more than twenty, with the sole purpose of deceiving public opinion. In order to facilitate the passage of this reactionary bill interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and to deceive the world, the utterly bored House Foreign Affairs Committee did not hesitate to once again raise the tattered banner of "anti-Soviet and anti-communist." The chairman of the committee, Eaton, even deliberately exclaimed on the 3rd that "Europe is in the midst of a great revolution." The Special Congress finally added the "leprosy dog" Chiang bandit government, which already had half its body buried in the ground, to this meager "emergency aid" item. This further proclaims to the world how pitifully small the gambling stake of the American imperialist thug has become; to think that this insignificant sum can rescue four moribund reactionary groups suffering the blows of the people across the country, is it not self-deception? No wonder the "Cincinnati Enquirer" said dejectedly on the 8th: "This is like throwing banknotes into a giant wind."

　　美帝流氓赌本不多
  　“国会”通过“援助”
  　法意奥蒋一点点钱决救不了四个奴才
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：乌鸦环绕之下，必有死尸之臭；美特别国会经过近一个月的开会，终于十五日通过五亿九千七百万美元的所谓“紧急援助”法、意、奥及蒋匪法案，该案系杜鲁门于十一月十七日提出，那正是法意工人阶级举行或酝酿空前大罢工与示威，而法意反动当局的命运十分危急的时候，美帝总部妄图以此附有苛刻条件的区区之数，抢救法意奥之反动统治免于危亡。但法案提出之后，却引起民主世界舆论及美国人民的强烈抗议，反映在美帝匪伙内部，则表现为共和党与民主党两党首领们之大演无耻双簧，在先“援欧”抑或先“援蒋”、贷款数目太“大”抑或太“少”的题目上，进行哓舌的互辩，提出的所谓修正案竟达二十余件，无非借此朦混舆论。为使这个干涉别国内政的反动法案便于通过，并以此欺骗世人，穷极无聊的众院外委会竟不惜再次打出“反苏反共”的破烂旗子。该外委会主席伊顿更在三日故意惊呼“欧洲正在大革命中”。特别国会最后则又将大半个身子已被埋入土中的“扶不起的癞皮狗”——蒋匪政府也添入这个区区“紧急援助”项下，这就更加昭告世界，美帝国主义流氓的赌本已少得多么可怜；想以这微不足道之数，就能抢救四个遭受全国人民打击的垂危反动集团，岂不是自欺欺人。无怪“辛辛提那询问报”八日沮丧的说：“这等于把钞票掷到巨风里”。
