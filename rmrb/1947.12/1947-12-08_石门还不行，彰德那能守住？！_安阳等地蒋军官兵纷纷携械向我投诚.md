　　"If Shimen can't hold, how can Zhangde be defended?!"
    Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers in Anyang and other places defected to our side with their weapons.
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 5th] After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Chiang-Yan bandit troops who stubbornly defended Anyang, Taiyuan, and Yuci were increasingly panic-stricken under our powerful political offensive. Lower-ranking officers and soldiers abandoned the darkness and turned to the light, defecting to our side with their weapons. On October 24th, Xue Yungui, the squad leader of the seventh squad of the Special Service Company of the Ninth Column of the Yan bandit troops stationed in Jingyu, Yuci, led eight soldiers, one light machine gun, six rifles, and five hundred rounds of ammunition to defect. According to Xue, the Yan bandit soldiers received half a catty of grain per day and 40,000 yuan in salary per month, enough to buy a pack of cigarettes for 2,000 yuan. There was no firewood for cooking, so they tore down the houses of ordinary people. Over one hundred houses have already been torn down in Jingyu. When they escaped, they first got the deputy squad leader, who was monitoring their activities, drunk with wine, and left a letter for the captain explaining the reasons for their departure: "1. No democracy, 2. We have become turtles in a jar and will definitely be eliminated by the Eighth Route Army, 3. You are a bandit troop." The Chiang bandit soldiers in Anyang were also secretly discussing: "If Shimen can't hold, how can Zhangde be defended? The Eighth Route Army will attack the city at any time!" They were constantly looking for opportunities to escape or defect. Wang Jinhuan and four other soldiers of the 317th Regiment of the Chiang bandit 40th Division defected to our side with their guns successively in recent days. The fleeing landlords in Anyang were even more panicked due to the development of our political offensive, and they discussed: "Chiang Kai-shek is unreliable!" They contacted the democratic government one after another, requesting to return to their hometowns - the liberated areas. According to statistics from Ye County in the past month, the number of fleeing landlords who have returned to the liberated areas has reached eighty-four.

　　“石门还不行，彰德那能守住？！”
    安阳等地蒋军官兵纷纷携械向我投诚
    【本报太行五日电】石家庄解放后，孤守安阳、太原、榆次的蒋阎匪军，在我强大政攻下，益形慌恐，下级官兵纷纷弃暗投明，携械向我投诚。十月二十四日，驻榆次井峪阎匪九纵队特务营一连七班长薛云贵，率士兵八名，轻机枪一挺，步枪六枝，子弹五百发投诚。据薛谈，阎匪士兵每天斤半谷，一月发饷四万元，买一支纸烟两千元。做饭没柴烧，拆老百姓的房子，井峪已拆了一百多间。彼等逃出时，是先将监视活动的副班长用酒灌醉，并给队长留信说明出走原因：“一、不民主，二、成了瓮中鳖，一定要被八路军消灭，三、你们是土匪队伍。”安阳蒋匪士兵也暗地议论：“石门还不行哩彰德那能守住？八路军不定啥时攻城？”时刻寻找机会逃亡或投诚。蒋匪四十师三一七团士兵王金环等五人，先后于日前携枪投我。安阳逃亡地主，由于我政治攻心战开展，更为惊慌，纷纷议论：“蒋介石靠不住了！”纷纷向民主政府接头，请求返回其故乡——解放区。邺县近一月来统计，返回解放区之逃亡地主已达八十四人。
