    Taihang Local Armed Forces
    Take the Initiative to Attack the Enemy
    Annihilating More Than 300 Bandits in Ten Days
    [Taihang, 10th dispatch] The Taihang local armed forces actively responded to the military region's call, taking the initiative to launch a grain protection struggle and crack down on the Chiang-Yan bandits who were frantically seizing grain and conscripting soldiers. From the 20th to the 30th of last month, in ten days, a total of 18 battles, large and small, were fought, capturing 184 enemies, killing and wounding 150, seizing 3 light machine guns, 1 small cannon, 63 rifles, 4 defective guns, more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition, destroying 3 bunkers, and capturing 5 enemy strongholds. The ten-day operation showed three characteristics: (1) Taking the initiative to continuously attack the enemy. For example, our 4th Military Sub-district troops, combined with the independent battalions of various counties, fought back to the Xiu (Wu) - Huo (Jia) - Wu (Zhi) triangle area, captured four strongholds, crushed the enemy's counterattack with more than 1,000 troops, killed and captured 146 enemies, seized 3 machine guns, 14 rifles, and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and liberated dozens of villages and towns. On the 29th, a surprise attack was launched on the pseudo-township office in En Village, Jiaozuo, killing and wounding 12 enemies, causing panic among the Chiang bandits in Jiaozuo. (2) The enemy advances, we advance, penetrating deep into the enemy's rear and seizing the enemy's weaknesses. The Tai Valley Regiment of our 2nd Military Sub-district, combined with the Yu-Tai-Qi working team, ambushed Yan bandits robbing grain in Rencun on the 23rd, wiping out 17 enemies. On the 25th, taking advantage of the enemy's absence for grain robbery and internal weakness, a long-distance surprise attack was launched on the key village stronghold in the Yu-Tai-Qi triangle area, capturing the village in one fell swoop, and all 13 Yan bandits were captured alive, seizing 1 small cannon, 6 rifles, and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. Our sudden action threatened the flanks of the Yan bandits, causing the enemy to panic and become overwhelmed. The Yan bandits who occupied our Fancun fled back to their lair in a hurry. (3) Extinguishing the Jiang-Yan organized secret society armed forces. On the 23rd of last month, the Anyang Independent Battalion, combined with the militia working teams of Lin, Tang, and Wu, launched an attack on the bandit gangs entrenched in Youhe, Qian'an, and Hou'annan at 3:00 in the morning, capturing 34 enemies and killing and wounding 33. Our Qi County Independent Battalion also cooperated with the militia to attack more than 60 members of Yan Bandit's "Returning Home Society" entrenched in Qitangtou on the 29th, wiping out more than half of the enemies, and the remaining bandits fled to Qixian city. Currently, our armed forces in various places are continuing to actively attack the enemy.

    太行地方武装
    主动进攻敌人
    十天歼匪三百余名
    【太行十日电】太行地方武装积极响应军区号召、主动出击展开护粮斗争、打击疯狂抢粮抓丁之蒋阎匪。从上月二十日至三十日十天中，共计大小战斗十八次，俘敌一百八十四人，毙伤敌一百五十人，缴获轻机枪三挺、小炮一门、步枪六十三枝、缺枪四枝、子弹三千余发，烧毁碉堡三座、攻克敌据点五处。十天作战中，显示三个特点：（一）主动的连续向敌出击。如我四分区部队结合各县独立营，打回修（武）获（嘉）武（陟）三角地区，攻克四据点，粉碎敌千余兵力的反扑，毙俘敌一百四十六人，缴机枪三挺，步枪十四枝，子弹二千余发，解放村镇数十处。二十九日，奔袭焦作恩村镇伪乡公所，毙伤敌十二名，使焦作蒋匪恐慌不安。（二）敌进我进，深入敌后，抓敌弱点。我二分区太谷团，结合榆太祁武工队，于二十三日深入敌后布袋庄，伏击任村抢粮阎匪，歼敌十七名之后，二十五日，又乘敌外出抢粮内部空虚之际，向榆太祁三角地带之要村据点，实行远距离奔袭，一举攻克该村，十三名阎匪全部生俘，缴获小炮一门，步枪六枝，弹药二百余发。我这一突然行动，威胁阎匪侧背，敌顾此失彼，恐慌万状，侵占我范村阎匪，仓惶窜回老巢。（三）扑灭蒋阎组织的会门武装。上月二十三日，安阳独立营结合林、汤、武民兵武工队，于早晨三时，向盘踞有河、前后安南之匪会队进剿，计俘敌三十四名，毙伤敌三十三名。我祁县独立营亦配合民兵，于二十九日向盘踞祁堂头阎匪之“还乡会”六十余人进攻，歼敌过半，残匪向祁县城逃去。现我各地武装正继续主动向敌进击。
