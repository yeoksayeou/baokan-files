　　Qinbo Our Army Enters Fengfeng
　　Completely Annihilating Over Fifty Enemy Troops
　　[Our Newspaper News] The Qinbo local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Taihang, for the second time, attacked and entered Fengfeng, completely annihilating the Xuzhuang Self-Defense Regiment, killing, wounding, and capturing over fifty enemy troops, including the enemy captain. After months of arduous fighting by our army and people, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, the situation in the Fourth Military Sub-district has fully unfolded, causing the struggle to gradually become deadlocked around the strongholds, and recently even directly attacking the lairs of the Chiang bandits along the Daoqing Railway, making the enemy uneasy day and night. Since our Qinbo Column's victorious surprise attack on West Fengfeng on November 8th, the enemy has been extremely panicked, enforcing martial law day and night, and prohibiting the entry and exit of passing pedestrians. Taking advantage of this opportunity, our Qinbo Column launched another strong attack on East and West Fengfeng on the night of November 18th. The battle began at 12 o'clock. Our valiant warriors from various brigades quickly approached the enemy and rushed into the village, compressing the enemies of East Fengfeng and Xuzhuang into one blockhouse. They immediately covered the engineers to place explosives. With a boom, the enemy deputy captains Xu Zhaoji, Xu Jike, and nineteen others were all buried underground. At this time, our troops from all directions had successively rushed into the village. The enemy's 38th Division in Wangfeng came out to reinforce, but were beaten back by our fierce artillery fire and never came out again. After two hours of fierce fighting, our army won a complete victory and immediately withdrew from the battle. In this battle, a total of twenty-eight enemy soldiers, including the self-defense captain, were killed, more than ten enemy soldiers were wounded, thirty enemy soldiers and puppet army family members were captured, six bunkers were burned, one was destroyed, one machine gun, eleven rifles, more than 300 rounds of ammunition, one rickshaw, ten head of livestock, and some other military supplies were seized. Our army suffered no casualties. Now the enemy is extremely panicked. The 38th Division has rushed to transfer two companies to garrison West Fengfeng, making their forces even more dispersed, creating a favorable opportunity for us to annihilate the enemy. This glorious battle example has been commended by the Taihang Military Region. (Yang Huibo)

　　沁博我军打入冯封
  　全歼守敌五十余名
    【本报讯】太行四分区沁博地方武装二次攻入冯封，全歼徐庄自卫团，计毙伤俘敌队长以下五十余名。经我军民几个月来的奋战，屡次给敌以痛击，四分区的局面完全展开，使斗争逐渐胶着于据点，近更直捣道清沿线蒋匪巢穴，使敌昼夜不安。自我沁博纵队于十一月八日强袭西冯封胜利后，敌人恐慌异常，日夜戒严，禁止来往行人出入。趁此机会，我沁博纵队又于十一月十八日夜向东西冯封再次发动强攻，战斗于十二时发起，我各大队健儿迅速接近敌人，冲入村内，把东冯封、徐庄之敌人压缩在一个炮楼内，当即掩护工兵下好炸药，轰的一声，敌正副队长徐肇基、徐继科以下十九人全埋在地下。此时各路我军已相继冲入村内。王封敌三十八师出来增援，被我一阵猛烈炮火打击，缩回去再也不出来了。激战两小时，我军全胜，当即撤出战斗。此役共毙敌自卫队长以下二十八名，打伤敌十余名，俘敌及伪军家属三十名，烧碉堡六座，炸毁一座，缴机枪一挺，步枪十一枝，子弹三百余发，洋车一辆，牲口十头，其他军用品一部。我军无一伤亡。现在敌人恐慌异常，三十八师赶调两个连驻防西冯封，使其兵力更加分散，造成我有利歼敌机会。这一光辉战例，太行军区曾予嘉奖。（杨惠波）
