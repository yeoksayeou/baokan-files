　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 23rd: Comprehensive reports indicate that the UNRRA China Office and the Chiang Kai-shek's CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) are scheduled to formally conclude operations by the end of this year. However, their work in China will continue through the "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee," jointly formed by the US and Chiang.

　　Facts from the past two years prove that the UNRRA China Office is an American imperialist aggression organ, and CNRRA is merely its tool for aggression in China. To meet the needs of American imperialist aggression, CNRRA has become a vast and complex institution, including the Agricultural Business Committee, the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee, the Industrial and Mining Business Committee, the Health Business Committee, the Fisheries Administration, the Truck Management Office, the Water Transport Brigade, the Air Transport Brigade, etc. All these institutions are directly controlled by American personnel and technology, and their activities are all in line with the interests of American imperialist aggression in China. These institutions are identical in nature to the agricultural, relief, construction, automobile, transportation, health and other "service bureaus" established by American imperialism to supervise Greece. Now these institutions are entirely retained by the "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee," and the "Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee" is specifically renamed the "Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau" to continue and strengthen its aggressive activities. A large number of American UNRRA personnel have been reassigned to the "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee" to lead these activities.

　　UNRRA Director Rooks, during his visit to China in October, colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek authorities to determine a "long-term rehabilitation" plan, i.e., a long-term aggression plan against China. The specific content of this plan includes continuing to strengthen control over China's industry, agriculture, fisheries, and other production sectors, as well as expanding the monopolization of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing, such as establishing drug manufacturing plants, penicillin factories, surgical instrument factories, etc. Rooks announced in Washington in November that the board of directors of the "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee," composed of five foreigners (i.e., Americans), has the "power to supervise and advise" on the implementation of the above plans. This means that in the future, the "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee," controlled by Americans, will directly become the supervisory organ for Chiang Kai-shek's industrial, agricultural, fisheries, medical, and other production sectors.

　　In the past two years, American imperialism, through UNRRA and CNRRA, has made great progress in controlling and manipulating China's agriculture, industry, mining, fisheries, and transportation. Under the guise of "mechanizing Chinese agriculture," UNRRA launched efforts to control China's agricultural production. UNRRA widely established agricultural reclamation machinery repair plants, farm tool factories, rural small factories, and mechanized chemical fertilizer plants in various parts of the KMT-controlled areas, tightly controlling rural industry in the KMT-controlled areas. It also trained a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's agricultural technicians to serve American agricultural aggression plans. UNRRA used these methods to smoothly deploy an agricultural aggression base network in the KMT-controlled areas. It is reported that in addition to a large-scale agricultural reclamation machinery repair general factory on Fuxing Island in Shanghai, there are also 18 branches and three blacksmith shops distributed in various provinces of the KMT-controlled areas. In Shaoyang, Hunan, there are eight small-scale demonstration factories with a very wide range of businesses, including paint, white powder, cement, sulfuric acid, glass manufacturing, and so on. During his visit to China, Rooks planned to establish large-scale fertilizer plants in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hebei provinces, and set up engineering stations in various places.

　　UNRRA also colluded with Chiang Kai-shek to directly plunder agricultural land in the KMT-controlled areas, enslaving farmers in the KMT-controlled areas to engage in raw material production for the United States. Within the territory of thirteen counties, including Fuyang and Taihe in northern Anhui, the "cooperative farms" directly under the "Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee" of UNRRA, included 4.4 million mu of agricultural land, a staggering scale. The 125,000 mu of land in the Chadian agricultural area and Yangliuqing farm in the suburbs of Tianjin, which were seized from farmers by the enemy puppets and Chiang Kai-shek, are also planned to be operated under the technical guidance of UNRRA. The "Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee" has branches in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and each county has a work team. Their task is to plunder agricultural land in the Yellow River flood area and establish "farms" similar to those in northern Anhui. One of the reasons why UNRRA was so enthusiastic about helping Chiang Kai-shek rush to complete the blocking of the Yellow River, flooding the liberated areas, was to seize the fertile agricultural land in the Yellow River flood area together with Chiang Kai-shek, as a raw material production base for the United States. The "Measures for Surveying and Re-demarcating Land in the Yellow River Flood Area," promulgated by the Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan in October, have decided to adopt serfdom methods, organizing all the land in the Yellow River flood area into so-called "self-cultivating farms" and "cooperative farms," forcing farmers in the Yellow River flood area to engage in slave labor for the US and Chiang Kai-shek. However, the advance of the People's Liberation Army in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces has frustrated and shattered the realization of this plan by Chiang Kai-shek.

　　In addition, a large number of UNRRA fishing vessels under the Fisheries Administration of CNRRA completely monopolized fishing activities on the Chinese sea. From the Bohai Sea in the north to the Hainan Island and the Taiwan Sea in the south, all were occupied by UNRRA fishing boats. The fish caught by UNRRA were dumped in large quantities in the Chinese market. UNRRA used its capital and technological advantages to completely overwhelm China's private fishing industry. A large number of private fishing businesses went bankrupt, and millions of Chinese fishermen suffered and are suffering from the threat of unemployment. The Chinese fishing industry has strongly opposed UNRRA's fishing aggression activities in China, but UNRRA and the Chiang Kai-shek authorities have ignored them. UNRRA also colluded with Chiang Kai-shek to use UNRRA fishing vessels to form the "China-US Fisheries" company in order to further monopolize China's fishing industry.

　　The air transport brigade of CNRRA (i.e., Chennault's team) is engaged in China's air transport aggression activities, and also engages in civil war business, which is well known. The water transport brigade of CNRRA is engaged in commercial transportation in China, which has also aroused opposition from the Chinese shipping industry.

　　The "Post-War Rehabilitation Committee," recently established by UNRRA and Chiang Kai-shek, is an important institution for American imperialist economic aggression against China, which has been fully proven by the above facts.

　　联总是美帝侵华机关
  　蒋贼扩大行总充当卖国走狗把蒋区工农矿业掠夺个精光
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合报导：联总中国分署与蒋匪行总已定今年底正式结束，但该两机构在华工作，则已决定由美蒋共同组成之“善后事业委员会”继续。两年来的事实证明，联总中国分署为美国侵华机关，而行总又只是联总侵华的御用工具。为符合美帝国主义侵华需要，行总已成为一庞大复杂之机构，其中包括农业业务委员会，黄泛区复兴委员会，工矿业务委员会，卫生业务委员会，渔管处，卡车管理所，水运大队，空运大队等。所有这些机构，全为美国人员与美国技术直接控制，其一切活动皆与美帝国主义侵华利益相适应。此等机构，与美帝国主义为监管希腊在希腊所组成之农业、善后、建设、汽车、交通、卫生等“服务局”，性质完全相同。现在这些机构又为“善后事业委员会”全部保留，并特别将“黄泛区复兴委员会”改为“黄泛区复兴局”，以便继续和加强其侵略活动。大批联总美方人员已改入“善后事业委员会”领导这些活动。联总署长鲁克斯十月间来华时，已与蒋匪当局串通决定一“长期善后”亦即长期侵华计划，其具体内容，除继续加强对于中国工、农、渔等各项生产的控制外，并将展开垄断中国医药制造的工作，例如建立制造药物厂、盘尼西林厂、外科用具厂等。鲁克斯十一月间在华盛顿宣布：由外人（即美人）五人参加之“善后事业委员会”董事会，对以上各项计划之执行有“督导及提出劝告之权”；这就是说，今后由美人控制之“善委会”将直接成为对蒋匪工、农、渔、医等各项生产之监督机关。两年来，美帝国主义通过联总及行总诸机构，在控制和操纵中国农、工、矿、渔以及交通运输事业上，获得极大进展。联总在“使中国农业机械化”的伪装下，展开了控制中国农业生产的工作。联总在蒋区各地广设农垦机械装修厂、农具工厂、农村小型工厂、机制化学肥料厂，严密控制蒋区农村工业。并大量训练蒋匪农业技术人员，使其为美国农业侵华计划服务。联总利用这些办法顺利地在蒋区布置了农业侵略基地网。据悉，除上海复兴岛设有一规模庞大之农垦机械装修总厂外，另有十八个分厂和三个铁匠厂，分布蒋区各省。湖南邵阳一地即有小型示范工厂八个，其业务范围极广，如漆、白粉、水泥、硫酸、玻璃制造等均包罗在内。鲁克斯来华时，已计划在川、湘、冀三省设立大规模肥料厂，并设置各地工程站。联总且与蒋匪勾结直接掠夺蒋区农地，奴役蒋区农民为美国从事原料生产。皖北阜阳、太和等十三县境内，直属联总“黄泛区复兴委员会”之“合作农场”，包括农地达四百四十万亩，规模惊人。天津近郊茶淀农区及杨柳青农场为敌伪及蒋匪掠夺农民土地所得之十二万五千亩土地，亦准备在联总技术指导下经营。“黄泛区复委会”在豫皖苏三省设有分会，各县皆设有工作队，其任务就是掠夺黄泛区农地，建立与皖北同样的“农场”。联总之所以热心助蒋抢先完成黄河堵口，水淹解放区人民，其目的之一即为急于与蒋匪共同占有肥沃的黄泛区农地，作为美国的原料生产基地。蒋匪行政院十月间颁布之“黄泛区土地勘测及重划办法”，已决定采行农奴制办法，将黄泛土地全部组为所谓“自耕农场”及“合作农场”，强制黄泛区农民为美蒋进行奴隶劳动。但人民解放军在豫皖苏境内之进军，挫折和打破了蒋匪这个计划的实现。此外，行总渔管处所属大批联总渔轮，则完全垄断了中国海面的捕鱼活动，北起渤海，南至海南岛以及台湾海面，无不为联总渔船所盘踞。联总所捕鱼在中国市场大量倾销。联总利用其资本和技术优势，完全压倒中国民营渔业，民营渔业大量破产，数百万中国渔民遭受了和正在遭受失业的威胁。中国渔业界曾对联总渔业侵华活动提出强烈反对，但联总与蒋匪当局漠然视之。联总并与蒋匪勾结利用联总渔船组成“中美渔业”公司，以便进一步垄断中国渔业。行总空运大队（即陈纳德大队）进行中国空中运输侵略活动，并兼营内战生意，更为众所周知。行总水运大队在华兼营商业运输，亦曾引起中国航业界之反对。联总及蒋匪新近设立的“善后事业委员会”，乃是美帝国主义经济侵华的重要机构，此已为上面事实所完全证明。
