Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to the Tianjin Yi Shi Bao: The "1948 Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Plan," drafted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in accordance with their American master's "Raw Material China" agricultural invasion plan, was approved by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Executive Yuan's routine meeting on November 11th. The plan was first approved by the Chiang Kai-shek "National Economic Commission" on October 2nd. The content of the plan is all-encompassing, from agricultural extension, agricultural economic research, tung oil research, and aquatic product research, to agricultural education and land surveying, all of which are allowed to be controlled by American personnel and technology. In fact, it sells out all of China's agricultural sovereignty to American imperialism, reducing China to a raw material supply base enslaved by the United States. The plan stipulates that American aircraft can freely conduct "land surveys" on Chinese territory, and a large number of American "agricultural experts" will enter China. Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the political beggar Zuo Shunsheng, openly admitted in his interview with reporters that this plan was "the result of repeated exchanges of views with the American side."

　　蒋匪遵照美帝意旨卖尽当光农业主权
    【新华社陕北六日电】据天津益世报载：蒋匪依照其美国主子“原料中国”农业侵华计划所拟定之“三十七年度中美农业技术合作计划方案”，已于十一月十一日为蒋匪行政院例会所通过。该案先于十月二日经蒋匪“全国经济委员会”通过。该案内容无所不包，从农业推广、农业经济研究、桐油研究、水产研究，直到农业教育及土地测量，皆允由美国人员与技术控制，事实上是将中国农业主权全部出卖于美帝国主义，沦中国为受美国奴役的原料供应地。该方案规定，美国飞机可在中国领土上自由进行“土地测量”，美国“农业专家”将大批进入中国。蒋匪农林部长政治乞丐左舜生于其对记者谈话时，公开承认此项方案为“迭次与美方交换意见之结果。”
