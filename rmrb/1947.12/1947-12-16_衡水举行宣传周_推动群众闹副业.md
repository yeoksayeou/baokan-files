[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 14th] According to a survey in Hengshui, over 80,000 people out of the county's population of over 150,000 are facing food shortages before the end of the year, indicating a severe famine. To alleviate this, the County Committee called for widespread organization of winter production and economical preparations for famine. In late November, a five-day propaganda week was launched to encourage the masses to calculate their accounts and create household plans, supplementing insufficient agricultural income with sideline occupations. This propaganda awakened the broad masses, and the majority of the county's population joined the wave of production, universally organizing spinning groups, transport teams, and various other sideline occupations. For example, after calculations by the masses in Dagge Village, Second District, 14 underground cellars were dug for cotton spinning and weaving. The largest could accommodate six looms and 22 spinning wheels, while the smallest could accommodate 12 spinning wheels. They felt that spinning and weaving in underground cellars had great advantages: saving lamp oil, being warmer, creating a lively atmosphere, producing good thread due to the humidity, reducing breakage, and facilitating political education. Currently, 232 people are working in the cellars, using 183 spinning wheels and 31 looms. Village cadres are also leading by example in saving, and agricultural association cadres have sworn to guarantee not to waste a single penny of the masses' resources in the future. Furthermore, in Donggai Village, Second District, truly everyone is busy, and every household is spinning cotton. Except for the households that were struggled against, all 252 households have spinning wheels, some even having two or three. They have also organized four oil presses, one flour mill, one food shop, one noodle shop, and one transport team. With a total of 350 spinning wheels and 97 looms, they can earn over 40,000 yuan per day from spinning and weaving alone. They universally recognize that only by intensifying production can they overcome the famine next spring; doing something is always better than sitting idle.

    衡水举行宣传周
    推动群众闹副业
    【本报冀南十四日电】衡水根据调查，全县十五万余人口中，有八万余人的粮食吃不到年底，灾荒很严重。县委会为挽救灾荒，号召普遍组织冬季生产，节约备荒，并在十一月下旬开展了五天的宣传周，号召群众算帐，做按家计划，农业收成不足要以副业补缺粮。这一宣传唤醒了广大的群众，全县绝大多数的群众卷入生产浪潮，普遍组织了纺织组、运输队各种各样的副业。如二区大葛村群众经过大家计算后，挖了十四个地窟，纺棉织布。最大的能容六张织布机，二十二辆纺花车，小的也能容十二辆纺花车。在地窟子里纺织，他们感到有很大的好处，可以省灯油、不冷、热闹、借着潮气还能出好线子、不断头、且还能进行政治教育。现在入地窟子有二百三十二个人，纺花车一百八十三辆，织布机三十一张。该村干部更以身作则节约，农会干部并宣了誓，保证今后不浪费群众一点资财。又如二区东盖村，已真正作到家家无闲人，户户都纺棉。该村除被斗户外，其余二百五十二户，家家都有纺车，甚至还有两三辆的，并组织了四个油坊，一佃粉坊，一个饭铺，一个挂面坊，一个运输队。全村纺车三百五十辆，织布机九十七张，光纺织，每天能赚四万多元。他们普遍的认识到只有加紧生产，才能渡过明春灾荒；干点啥总比坐着强。
