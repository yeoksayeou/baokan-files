(Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 24th) In Xiyanggao Village, Second District of Linzhang, a cooperative was established using the fruits of the masses' struggle. Within this "mass cooperative," several landlords are being supported. They wield economic power and continue to stand above the masses. The masses are secretly angry but dare not speak out. All the capital in the cooperative comes from the fruits of struggle, including "Chinese and Western medicines" valued at tens of thousands of yuan, large quantities of grain, cotton, and cash. These fruits were not distributed to the masses at all but were instead valued and invested in the cooperative. Furthermore, under the slogan of engaging in winter sideline production, the masses were "called upon" to invest an additional 800,000+ yuan. Of the seven people in charge of the cooperative, besides the three basic members of the masses such as Ma Zhenlu, three are landlords who had been liquidated by the masses. These people, relying on their ability to write and calculate, have deceived the village cadres, whose class standpoint is unclear, and have wormed their way into the cooperative to act recklessly. These seven "cooperative cadres" are supplied by the cooperative, eating white steamed buns, noodles, and stir-fried cabbage every day. Every few days, they even "improve their living standards" by eating meat. In reality, even if they didn't "improve," no family in the village could compare. Since it is "the entire village's business," there are often some idlers who are not questioned. The food and miscellaneous expenses (oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, smoking) for the seven people amount to more than 3,000 yuan per day, nearly 100,000 yuan per month. In addition, each person receives a monthly salary of three dou of rice, totaling two shi and one dou of rice, which is equivalent to 63,000 yuan in current market prices. In total, it costs 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per month to support these seven "cooperative cadres." Although the cooperative has such a large capital, it does not serve the needs of the masses. It is quite active in selling medicines, cigarettes, wine, colored paper, and other sundries, but in reality, the profits are very limited. The masses are very dissatisfied and have been discussing: "The business is not small, but the money earned is not enough for one family (the cooperative personnel)!" "The capital from our village is being used for the landlords to make money!" "We struggled against the landlords, but it gave them a good idea!" After understanding these circumstances, the district has begun to educate the cadres within the cooperative, purge the landlord elements, temporarily suspend business, and is preparing (should immediately, not preparing—Editor) to deeply mobilize the masses and audit the accounts.

　　西羊羔村合作社成了地主安乐窝
    【本报冀南二十四日电】临漳二区西羊羔村，用群众斗争果实开了个合作社，这个“群众合作社”内养活着好几个地主，他们操着经济大权，仍旧站在群众头上，群众暗中气愤，敢怒不敢言。社内资本全是斗争果实，计有估价几十万元的“中西药品”、大批的粮食、棉花、现款等，这些果实根本未分到群众手里，就作价入社了。还有在搞冬季副业的口号下，又“号召”群众入股约八十多万元。社里共七个人当家问事，除马振禄等三个基本群众外，有三个是被群众清算过的地主，这些人仗着能写会算，蒙蔽了阶级立场不明确的村干，钻进合作社胡作乱为。这七个“社干”是由社内供给，每天吃的是白馍、面条、炒白菜，隔几天还“改善生活”吃一次肉，其实他们不“改善”，村里也没一家能比得上的。由于是“全村的买卖”，常常有些吃闲饭的人也没人过问，七个人的火食杂支（油、盐、酱、醋、吸烟）每天总在三千元以上，每月将近十万元。另外还有每人每月薪金米三斗，共二石一斗米，依现市价合洋六万三千元，总算起来，每月就得用十五六万元去养活这七个“社干”。该社营业虽有这样大的资本，但不为群众需要办事，在卖药、卖烟、酒、五色纸等杂货上相当活跃，实际上获利很有限。群众非常不满，纷纷议论着：“买卖不小，卖的钱不够一家（社内人员）的！”“咱村上拿的本钱，叫地主赚钱了！”“咱将地主斗争了，倒给人家生了个好办法！”区上了解这些情况后，已开始教育社内的干部，清洗地主分子，暂时停止营业，并准备（应立即、而不是准备。——编者）深入发动群众，清理帐目。
