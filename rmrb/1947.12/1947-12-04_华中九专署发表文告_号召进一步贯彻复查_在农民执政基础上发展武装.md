Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd: The military and civilians in the Southern Jiangsu (Nantong), Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong areas, bordering the Yangtze River and the sea and only separated from Shanghai by a strip of water, have been actively developing forces for a major counter-offensive on the basis of their victorious persistence in the patriotic self-defense struggle over the past year. The Ninth Administrative Office of the local democratic government issued an announcement last month, first summarizing the year-long bloody and arduous struggle of the entire military and civilians, which crushed the long-term, cruel, and repeated "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations of over 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This resulted in the annihilation of over 5,000 bandits, the disintegration of over 11,000 Chiang Kai-shek local bandits, the retention of large areas of territory, the maintenance of political power in eight-tenths of the entire region, the implementation of land reform on nearly five million mu of land, and the preliminary resolution of livelihood issues for nearly one million landless and land-poor peasants. Six to seven thousand peasants voluntarily joined the main force to protect their homes and land, and the local people's armed forces expanded four to five times. The announcement went on to point out that the ability of the people's government in the enemy's rear to persist and even develop after Chiang's "encirclement and suppression" was mainly due to the high level of awareness and fighting spirit displayed by the vast numbers of liberated poor and landless peasants. During the anti-"encirclement and suppression" operations, without exception, village cadres participated in the armed struggle, and the continuous development of mass forces in the struggle against the enemy ensured victory. Therefore, it is now necessary to further implement re-examination, vigorously promote active elements in the re-examination struggle, and make the rural government truly the government of liberated peasants, in order to lay the foundation for the development of counter-offensive forces. The announcement concluded by calling for vigorous development of armed forces on the basis of peasant governance, thorough implementation of re-examination, development of the struggle against rent collection and forced labor in border areas, strengthening of financial construction, guaranteeing the people's livelihood and supplies for the troops, achieving self-sufficiency in food and soldiers, eliminating bandits and special agents, and launching widespread propaganda for the victory of the great counter-offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and local bandits to accelerate the disintegration of the enemy and strive for greater victories.
