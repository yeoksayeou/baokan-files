    Taihang Second Special District Allocates Materials
    To Aid Pingding Disaster-Stricken Compatriots
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Taihang, 14th] The Taihang Second Special Administrative Office recently allocated a large quantity of cotton, cotton clothes, and homespun cloth to aid impoverished farmers in the disaster area of Pingding, and organized transportation and other sideline production to help the disaster victims develop a self-salvation movement. Due to the Yan bandit's heavy taxes and cruel plunder, vast areas of the county have become uninhabited zones of barren land. Although the democratic government has repeatedly provided relief and organized the masses to carry out production since the Zhengtai Campaign was liberated by us this spring, the county has been severely attacked by drought and hail disasters throughout the year, with an average harvest of only 20-30%. According to statistics from six districts and more than fifty villages, including the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, which were severely affected by the disaster, more than 7,800 people will not be able to survive the winter cold. To this end, our Second Special Administrative Office has specially issued more than 3,000 jin of cotton, more than 2,000 pieces of cotton clothing, and 350 jin of cloth. The Pingding County Government has also raised a batch of clothes and cloth to help the disaster victims keep out the winter cold. It has also been decided that all grain and money taxes for this year will be waived. When distributing the relief materials this time, the distribution method of the mass line was mastered by overcoming the past egalitarianism and the selfish views of some cadres, and everyone was very satisfied. With the government's relief and assistance, the production enthusiasm of the disaster-stricken masses has also been further improved. For example, the masses in the fourth district put forward the slogan of labor self-salvation: "Relief is help, life depends on oneself," and organized 200 head of livestock to sell coal after the relief. Villages such as Xisuohuang, Guanzhuangnao, and Beizhuang in the second district have also organized to engage in portering, transportation, and other production.

    太行二专拨发物资
    救济平定灾胞
    【本报太行十四日电】太行二专署，顷拨发大批棉花、棉衣、土布等，救济平定灾区贫苦农民，并组织运输等副业生产，帮助灾民开展自救运动。该县由于阎匪的苛重捐税和残酷掠夺，广大地区已成土地荒芜的无人区。今春正太战役为我解放后，虽经民主政府一再救济与组织群众进行生产，但在一年中旱、雹灾害严重袭击，全县平均不过二、三成年景，灾重的一、二、四、五、六、七等六个区五十余村统计，就有七千八百余人渡不过冬寒。为此，我二专署特发给棉花三千余斤，棉衣二千余件，布三百五十余斤，平定县府亦已募集衣服、布匹一部，救济灾民以御冬寒。并决定今年的粮款一律豁免。此次救济物资分配时，由于克服了过去的平均主义及某些干部的自私观点，掌握了群众路线的分配办法，大家非常满意。灾区群众在政府的救济帮助下，生产情绪亦更加提高。如四区群众提出“救济是帮助，生活靠自己”的劳动自救口号，在救济后组织了二百头牲口卖煤炭。二区西锁簧、冠庄瑙、北庄等村，也都组织起来，搞担挑、运输等生产。
