Bai Rusai's Textile Brigade
    Xu Lijing

    Bai Rusai's textile brigade in Lujiahe, Yangcheng, from March of last year to now, has increased the entire village's holdings by fifty-five sheep, two head of livestock, and thirty-five pigs, relying on textiles. They also have savings and equipment worth about one million yuan. This textile brigade becomes an agricultural mutual aid brigade during the busy farming season, and this year it has become a main force in agricultural labor. Its development process is as follows:

    Last spring, when the men of the village went to Yuncheng for transportation work, Bai Rusai discussed with Zheng Xiaogui and four others: "Let's each collect enough money for a catty of cotton, and have someone bring back cotton for us to spin together." So, everyone pooled 2,500 yuan and bought seven catties and fourteen taels of cotton, quickly making three bolts and three chi of cloth, which they sold and exchanged for fourteen catties of cotton. Everyone happily said, "If we keep spinning, we'll get even more next time!" Shangguan Xiaoxue and Li Xiaoqin, seeing the benefits of spinning, discussed, "Look how good Rusai and the five others are, why can't we help each other too?" After the fourteen catties of cotton were woven into cloth, they decided: besides the capital, each person would take a little less profit to spin again. They bought another fifteen catties of cotton and made willow-patterned cloth. Each wore a new outfit to a meeting in Yanshan Administrative Village. Many women in the audience were still wearing old clothes, but the five of them were dressed in brand new and tidy clothes, attracting hundreds of eyes.

    Under this impetus and influence, plus active organization, all seventy-one women in the village gradually organized themselves, forming a mutual aid brigade. However, during the organizational process, some elderly women were secretly discussing, "It's not even suitable for each person to be in their own home, who knows what will happen in the future?!" After Bai Rusai discovered this kind of ideological concern among the elderly, she immediately convened a meeting of group leaders and above to discuss a two-eight profit split. At that time, Li Xiaosai wove six bolts of cloth in thirteen days and was immediately given 3,600 yuan, which could buy eight dou of millet at market price. Xiaosai's enthusiasm was very high, and she ran around telling people, "Spinning is good, the profit is big!" Rusai seized the opportunity to convene a village-wide meeting, using Li Xiaosai's example of earning six sheng of rice a day to calculate the accounts for everyone, and let everyone brew in groups. From then on, the spinning movement was launched vigorously.

    Once, Huo Xiaoxiu secretly went home. Rusai followed her to her house and listened to Xiaoxiu while she cooked, saying, "If I don't watch, the pot will overflow, and if the rice isn't cooked well, the men will come back and scold me, I can't stand it!" Rusai immediately convened a meeting of group leaders and decided to spin cotton separately in each household; however, some people went to bed early at night, so it was decided to spin separately during the day and concentrate at night. Later, it was discovered that some young women were not enthusiastic about spinning, so the method of a four-six profit split for the family was studied (family gets six, individual gets four). The problem of the daughters-in-law was solved, but the little girls complained that winding thread was unprofitable, so it was decided that winding half a catty of thread would count as one work unit and would also be divided. However, everyone only wanted to spin and weave, and no one wanted to twist cotton pulp thread. Once, thirty catties of cotton were fluffed, but no one was willing to twist it. Rusai sat there alone and twisted for most of the day, but there was still a big pile. Another meeting was held, and it was decided that twisting five catties of cotton would count as ten points, fluffing eight catties would count as ten points, and pulping the thread for one bolt of cloth would count as six points. In this way, from fluffing to twisting, spinning, winding, pulping, and weaving, the entire process, big and small labor, both family and individuals could share profits, and spinning was consolidated.

    The men in the village transport goods, the women spin, and they bought a lot of pigs, but everyone hoped to buy a flock of sheep. Rusai understood everyone's thoughts, so she called everyone together to find a way. The women immediately decided to sell three fat pigs, plus spinning profits, and bought forty-five sheep, which have now bred more than a dozen lambs. This spring, everyone felt that there were not enough livestock, so they borrowed 500,000 yuan from the bank and bought a mule and a donkey. Rusai convened everyone to a meeting to mobilize them, and organized a large spinning drive that sold 300,000 yuan worth of goods. Adding 190,000 yuan earned by the men in transportation, they only needed to add 10,000 yuan to repay the loan.

    Because spinning has solved various difficulties, all the women in the village have automatically started spinning this winter, and each woman guarantees to weave seven and a half bolts of cloth.

　　白如赛的纺织大队
    许立敬
    阳城卢家河白如赛的纺织大队，从去年三月到现在，依靠纺织给全村增加了五十五只羊、两头牲口、三十五口猪，并有一部存款和用具，约值一百万元。这个纺织大队，在农忙时便成为农业互助大队，今年更成为农业劳动中一支主力军。它的发展过程如下：
    去年春天，该村男人到运城运输时，白如赛便与郑小贵等五人商议：“咱们每人集上一斤棉花钱，叫人家给咱捎回花来，在一块纺织。”于是，大家集中二千五百元，买回七斤十四两棉花，很快做成了三匹零三尺布，卖了，换回十四斤棉花，大家高兴的说：“咱一直纺织，再换一回就更多了！”上官小雪与李小琴，看到纺织有利，就商量着：“看人家如赛五个人多好，咱们就不能和她们互助？”十四斤棉花又织成布后，她们决定：除了本钱，一人少分一点红再纺织。又买了十五斤棉花，织成柳条花布，每人穿了一身新衣，到岩山行政村去开会，全场许多妇女，都依然穿着旧衣，唯有她们五个人衣服崭新整齐，吸引了几百双眼睛望着她们。
    在此推动影响下，再加积极组织，全村七十一个妇女，逐渐的组织起来，形成了互助大队。但是在组织过程中，一些老年妇女，都在背地议论着：“各人在各人家还不合适，往后还不知弄个甚样？！”白如赛发现老年人此种思想顾虑后，就马上召集了组长以上会议，讨论二八分红，当时李小赛十三天即织成六匹布，立即分给她三千六百元，按市价可以买到小米八斗，小赛情绪非常高涨，跑东跑西的告人说：“纺织就是好，利钱可大啦！”如赛趁热打铁的召开了全村会议，以李小赛每天可赚六升米的例子，给大家算帐，并让大家分组酝酿，从此纺织运动就轰轰烈烈展开了。
    有一次霍小秀偷偷的回去了，如赛就跟着到她家里听小秀边做饭边说：“不看着吧，锅溢了没办法，到时做不熟饭，男人们回来骂的受不住！”如赛又马上召开了组长会议，决定各回各家，分散纺花；不过有些人黑夜早早就睡了，于是再决定白天分散黑夜集中。后来又发现一部分青年妇女纺织不起劲，研究了家庭四六分红办法（家六个人四）媳妇们的问题解决了，可是小闺女们又嫌缠线无利，于是又决定缠半斤线为一个工，也要分红。但是大家只愿纺花织布，不愿搓花浆线，一次弹了三十斤花，无一人愿搓，如赛一个人坐在那里搓了大半天，看看还是一大堆。又开会决定，搓五斤花记十分，弹八斤记十分，浆一匹布的线记六分，这样由弹一直到搓、纺、缠、浆、织，整个过程大小劳动，家庭私人都可分红利，纺织便巩固了。
    村里男人运输，妇女纺织，买了不少猪，但是大家更希望能买到一群羊，如赛了解大家的心思，就召集大家想办法，妇女当场决定卖掉三个肥猪，又加纺织盈利，买进四十五只羊，现在已繁殖了十几个小羊。今春大家又感到牲口不够用，在银行贷了五十万款，买进一头骡、一头驴，如赛又召集大家开会动员，搞一次大纺织卖了三十万元，再加男人运输赚洋十九万元，只添一万元，就归还了贷款。
    因为纺织解决了各种困难，今冬全村妇女自动纺织开了，每一妇女保证织七匹半布。
