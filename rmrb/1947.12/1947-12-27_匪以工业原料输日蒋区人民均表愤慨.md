　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—Amidst the unanimous opposition of the people in the KMT-controlled areas to opening trade with Japan, the KMT bandits are even more actively engaged in trade with Japan. According to Shanghai newspaper reports from the middle of last month: since the KMT bandit government approved the opening of trade with Japan, it has continuously shipped chemical industrial raw materials such as salt to Japan. Recently, the KMT bandit family company, the Central Trust Bureau, shipped 100,000 tons of salt, 4,700 tons of soybeans, and 150,000 tons of high-quality, rich-content iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan for use in Japanese industry. In addition to a large number of smuggled luxury goods and industrial products imported from Japan, the Central Trust Bureau recently purchased a large quantity of rayon, and the first batch of 4,000 boxes has arrived in Shanghai, causing indignation among people in Shanghai's industrial circles.

　　匪以工业原料输日蒋区人民均表愤慨
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】在蒋区人民一致反对开放对日贸易声中，蒋匪对日贸易却更积极进行。据上月中旬上海报纸消息：自蒋匪政府通过开放对日贸易以来，即不断以食盐等化学工业原料输日，近蒋匪家族公司中央信托局，又以食盐十万吨，大豆四千七百吨，及品质优良含量丰富之海南岛铁矿砂十五万吨运日，以供日本工业之用。自日运入者除大量走私奢侈品及工业制成品外，中央信托局最近又购入大批人造丝，首批四千箱已抵沪，上海工业界人士对此均表愤慨。
