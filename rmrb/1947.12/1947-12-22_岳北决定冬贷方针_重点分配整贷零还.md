　　Northern Yue Decides on Winter Loan Policy
  　Focus on Allocating Loans in Bulk and Repaying in Installments
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 20th] In order to solve the winter production difficulties of hired and poor peasants, the Northern Yue Bank and the Northern Yue Administrative Office jointly convened a loan conference on the 6th of this month in the five counties of Qinyuan, Qin County, Anze, Tunliu, and Changzi in the central area of Northern Yue to study the issuance of 200 million yuan in production loans for hired and poor peasants. Representatives from the county committees, county governments, banks, and joint cooperatives of each county attended the meeting. The conference made a strict critique of past loans. It was pointed out that in the spring loans, the emphasis was on combining idle capital and restricting the use of loans. Some were afraid that the hired and poor peasants would not be able to repay, thus making it impossible for the most impoverished hired and poor peasants to obtain loans, and even lending to landlords and rich peasants. At the same time, because the loans were completely dependent on cadres, a few bad cadres arbitrarily controlled the loans. Secondly, the conference made careful discussions on the issues of loan targets, allocation, and usage, and reached the following consensus: (1) Those who have not thoroughly overturned their situation, or who appear to be middle peasants in form, but still have many difficulties in production, are our loan targets. Village cadres, cooperatives, and old middle peasants will not be granted loans. If village cadres need loans, and have not turned over in the land reform, the loan must be approved by the district level or above. The families of martyrs, soldiers, those who are honored, and cadres will be decided upon based on their class status; (2) Each village should handle loans entirely through hired and poor peasant groups; (3) In villages where the village government has not been thoroughly transformed during the land reform and power is not in the hands of the hired and poor peasants, the county has established a loan committee, and cadres personally take the loans to the countryside and lend them directly to the hired and poor peasants, except for hired and poor peasant village cadres; (4) Start with inspecting the winter production of the hired and poor peasants, discover their difficulties, and solve them with loans, and help them formulate loan production plans, and oppose purely economic viewpoints; (5) Loans should be used with a focus, find poor villages, find hired and poor peasants, and advocate borrowing in bulk and repaying in installments. The slogan is: lend and release as you collect, accelerate turnover, lend in bulk and repay in installments; (6) In the loan process, call on middle peasants to contribute idle capital, and hired and poor peasants to take out loans, and everyone should cooperate in production; (7) The interest rate is one and a half percent per month, and the procedures should be simplified as much as possible. The bank will establish temporary branches and go deep into the countryside to find hired and poor peasants. The meeting ended on the 18th, and the counties are now actively issuing loans.

　　岳北决定冬贷方针
  　重点分配整贷零还
    【本报太岳二十日电】为解决雇贫冬季生产困难，岳北银行与岳北专署特于本月六日联合召开岳北腹心区沁源、沁县、安泽、屯留、长子五县贷款会议，研究发放两万万元的雇贫生产贷款。参加会议者有各县县委、县府、银行、联合社等代表，大会对过去的贷款作了严格的批判，如今春贷款，强调结合游资，限制贷款用途，有的怕雇贫还不起，因此使困难最多的雇贫贷不上款，甚至贷给了地主、富农。同时，由于贷款完全依赖干部，使少数坏干部随便支配贷款。其次，大会对贷款的对象、分配、用途等问题，均作了慎重的讨论，获得一致意见如下：（一）翻身未翻透，或者从形式看是个中农，但生产上还存在许多困难，这是我们贷款的对象，村干部与合作社、老中农不予发放，如村干部贷款，在土改中没有翻身，贷款须经区以上批准，烈、荣、抗、干属，按成份决定；（二）各村应通过雇贫小组，全权处理贷款；（三）在土改中村政权没有彻底改造，政权未掌握到雇贫手里，县已成立贷款委员会，干部亲自带款下乡，一般不通过村干部，亲自贷给雇贫，但雇贫村干部例外；（四）从检查雇贫冬季生产着手，发现雇贫困难，以贷款加以解决，并帮助他们订出贷款生产计划，反对单纯的经济观点；（五）贷款应有重点使用，找穷村，找雇贫，提倡整借零还，口号是：随收随放，加速周转，整贷零还；（六）在贷款中，号召中农拿出游资，雇贫拿上贷款，大家合作搞生产；（七）利息一分五厘，手续力求简便，银行成立临时派出所，深入乡间找雇贫。会议十八日结束，现各县正积极发放贷款。
