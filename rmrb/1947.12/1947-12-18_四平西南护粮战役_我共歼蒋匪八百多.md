When they sneaked into the Dawa and Caijiazi areas, a unit of our cavalry immediately rose up to block them. After five hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was completely defeated and pursued for more than 30 li, with only a small number of bandit cavalry fleeing back in disarray. In this battle, 268 bandits were killed or wounded, and 550 enemy soldiers from the company commander level and below were captured. The captured items included eight 60mm mortars, 57 light and heavy machine guns, 458 submachine guns and American-style rifles, over 54,000 rounds of various bullets, and 150 artillery shells.
