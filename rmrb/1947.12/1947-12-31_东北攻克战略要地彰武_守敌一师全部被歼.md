Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 29th. The Northeast Democratic Allied Army captured Zhangwu County, a strategic point more than 200 li northwest of Shenyang, at 2 PM on the 28th. The entire enemy garrison, the 79th Division of the Chiang bandit 49th Army, was annihilated. The results of the battle are still being tallied. The 79th Division had two complete regiments annihilated in the Yangzhangzi battle in Jinxi on September 22nd of this year; this is after they were replenished and annihilated again.

Xinhua News Agency, Jireliao, 29th. Belated News: December 12th marked the anniversary of the founding of the Jirecha Military Region. The Military Region Headquarters issued a statement of accomplishments for the year, stating: Over the past year, our region has persisted behind enemy lines under various difficult circumstances, thwarting repeated "mopping up" operations by the Chiang bandits. We opened up and restored vast areas to carry out land reform, foiling the enemy bandits' plans to loot and create "no-man's lands." At the beginning of the establishment of the military region, we once captured Chongli County, an important town in Chahar Province, and annihilated the forces of Shi Yushan, a subordinate of Chiang Kai-shek follower Fu Zuoyi. In March of this year, we launched sabotage operations on the Pinggu Line, and in April, we returned north, severely attacking the enemy's major strongholds on the Pingdingbao, Duolun, and Guyuan highways, and recovered the strategically important Dushikou, annihilating the entire 22nd Regiment of the Provisional Cavalry 11th Brigade and a part of the Provisional 10th Column, and in May, we cooperated with the Rehe West battle and recovered Weichang. Over the past year, we have killed or wounded 7,796 officers and soldiers, including Chahar East Security Commander Shi Yushan and Regiment Commander Yin Xueyuan, and captured 5,703 officers and soldiers, including Regiment Commander Li Zhitang. 125 people surrendered. We seized a total of 24 mountain guns, anti-tank guns, and mortars, 171 light and heavy machine guns, 5,067 long and short guns, more than 410,000 rounds of various shells, more than 51,000 rounds of light machine gun ammunition, and more than 1,000 boxes and 480,000 rounds of rifle ammunition. Countless other ammunition and materials were also seized.
