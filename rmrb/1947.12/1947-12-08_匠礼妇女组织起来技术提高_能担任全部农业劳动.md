　　[Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 7th] Women in Jiangli Village, Yangcheng, have organized themselves over the past year, learned agricultural techniques, and now have the confidence to undertake all agricultural labor. Out of the village's 1,182 women, 545 are full laborers and 125 are semi-laborers. This year in March, 38 groups were organized, with 286 full and semi-laborers participating, accounting for more than 42 percent of the village's total female labor force. In agriculture, they have achieved success in hoeing millet, harvesting wheat, summer planting, planting corn, planting beans, and autumn harvesting of millet and beans, hoeing corn stalks, beating persimmons, and carrying manure. In addition, they plowed 599 mu of land in the autumn. Women like Yang Xiaolin and Ru Guixiang, who already knew how to plow, taught 69 other women this autumn, bringing the total number of women in the village who can handle a plow to 106. This provides a foundation for women to plow in the coming spring. They have also made great achievements in wasteland reclamation and have been rewarded by the county government. In terms of sideline occupations, from March to September, they spun more than 4,000 jin of yarn and wove 2,027 bolts of cloth. In addition to using some for themselves, they sold 606 and a half bolts of cloth. Among the 38 groups, Yang Xiaolin and Ru Guixiang's groups often help each other, while the remaining 36 groups, including Wu Nenghua's, engage in seasonal mutual aid.
    The village's experience in organizing women is as follows: (1) Start by organizing hired and poor women, first encouraging young women without children to participate in mutual aid, and selecting newly emancipated women as group leaders. Women from hired and poor backgrounds are already accustomed to participating in agricultural labor, making organization easier. In the village's 14 women's groups, 8 have newly emancipated women as group leaders, who actively lead and play a leading role. For example, Yang Xiaolin and Ru Guixiang demonstrate their exemplary role in everything they do.
    Second, the male mutual aid group leaders must provide specific support and assistance, and break through the thinking of the heads of women's households, eliminating improper public opinion such as criticizing women. For example, when women were plowing, the large group leader of Ru Guixiang's group held a meeting to break through the thinking of women's families, equipped them with large oxen and plows, and asked them to plow large tracts of land. As a result, not only did their group complete the task early, but they also exceeded the original plan by 110 mu and taught four apprentices how to plow. The male group leader of Zhang Xiaoni's group, when Zhang Xiaoni and others wanted to plow, ignored them and even said unpleasant things: "Women can plow the land? Can they eat the land!" As a result, the women in this group had a bad time, and they didn't plow the land. Third, it is necessary to implement equal exchange and work exchange methods. For example, in Zhang Xiaoni's family, when she went to work in the fields, there was no one to cook, and her husband often quarreled with her. Later, Xiaoni asked her neighbor, Old Lady ×, to cook for her in exchange for work, so Xiaoni could go to the fields without delaying the family's meals, and her family was very happy.

　　匠礼妇女组织起来技术提高
    能担任全部农业劳动
    【本报太岳七日电】阳城匠礼村妇女，一年来组织起来，已学到了农业技术，有了担任全部农业劳动的信心。全村一千一百八十二个妇女，内有全劳力五百四十五个，半劳力一百二十五个。今年三月组织起来三十八个组，参加的全半劳力二百八十六个，计占全村妇女全半劳力百分之四十二强。在农业上，锄谷、割麦、夏种、点玉茭、点豆，及秋收割谷、割豆、垡玉茭、打柿、担粪等件件都取得成绩，另外还秋垡地五百九十九亩。妇女杨小林、茹贵香等原来就会垡地的卅七人，今秋教会六十九个妇女学会垡地，全村共有一百零六个妇女已能掌犁，明春犁地妇女已经有了基础。开荒也做出很大成绩，受到县政府的奖励。在副业方面，三月至九月，共纺织四千余斤，共织布二千零二十七匹。除穿，还卖布六百零六个半。三十八个组中，杨小林、茹贵香两个组，经常互助，其余的武能华等三十六个组，是季节互助。
    该村组织妇女的经验如下：（一）要从雇贫妇女着手组织起来，首先是诱导青年妇女没孩子的参加互助，选择新翻身妇女当组长。雇贫出身的过去就有参加农业劳动的习惯，组织比较容易。在本村十四个妇女组中，就有八个新翻身妇女当组长，积极领导，起了带头作用。如杨小林、茹贵香事事都表现着她们的模范作用。
    其次，各男互助组长必须具体扶植、具体帮助，打通各妇女家庭当家人的思想，揭除对妇女说二话等不正当的舆论。如妇女垡地时，三闾茹贵香组大组长，开会打通妇女家庭思想，配备大犍牛和犁，叫她垡大块地，所以她们组的垡地，不但能早完成任务，还超过原计划一百一十亩，并教会四个徒弟垡地。四组张小妮等想去犁地，男组长不管他们，还说不好听的话：“妇女能犁地？能吃地！”结果这组妇女闹的一场没趣，地也没有去垡。第三、必须实行等价交换与变工办法。如张小妮家里，她去上地没人做饭，男人常和她吵嘴，后来小妮叫她院里×老娘给她做饭顶工，这样小妮去地也不误家里吃饭，家人很高兴。
