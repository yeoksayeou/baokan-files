Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th. Shandong's various organs and local cadres are actively clearing materials and conserving winter clothing to support the Great Counter-Offensive. The Lucentral District Party Committee called on all party members to overcome the difficulties after the Kuomintang bandits' devastation with the greatest effort, clear buried materials, collect all old materials, and use the old to save the new, to ensure supply. Yinan County has already cleared out 8,000 jin of cotton, more than 2,000 zhang of cloth, and forty to fifty boxes of medicine. Preliminary clearing in Junan County, Binhai, has revealed 50,000 jin of cotton, 14,000 towels, and more than 1,000 pieces of cotton clothing and overcoats. Cadres in various counties and districts in Lunan are actively conserving winter clothing. Fu Zhanru, the secretary of Cangshan (newly established county) County Party Committee, took the lead by announcing at a meeting that he would not receive a new overcoat or cotton coat this year, influencing cadres in the county and districts. Luxhui, Zhao (both newly established counties), and other counties saved winter clothing worth 2 million yuan. The Binhai Linyi Bank Office checked clothes that had been damaged in the past due to improper storage and repaired them for use, resulting in a saving of two-thirds of the cotton clothing that should have been received. Under the slogan "Wearing patched clothes is the most glorious," all cadres from the central to district levels in Jubei County saved 75 zhang of cloth and more than 30 jin of cotton.
