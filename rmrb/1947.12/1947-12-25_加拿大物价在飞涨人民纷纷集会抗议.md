    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Ottawa dispatch: Canada is suffering from the threat of soaring prices and inflation. According to statistics from the beginning of last month, Canadian food prices have soared 74 percent compared to pre-war levels, clothing prices have risen 57 percent, and in the past week, some foods have even more than doubled in price. Official materials reveal that the main reasons for the soaring prices are inflation and the manipulation and profiteering of large manufacturers. According to the Canadian Department of Commerce, the currency in circulation in Canada in 1939 was only 2.8 billion yuan, but it has now reached 7.5 billion yuan. Under the soaring prices, people's lives are deteriorating. Even according to government statistics, the minimum weekly expenditure for a Canadian worker's family is 43 yuan, while wages are less than 35 yuan per week. As for the 106,000 unemployed workers, they are struggling even more on the brink of starvation. Therefore, protest rallies are currently taking place throughout Canada, and the government receives a flood of protest letters and telegrams every day. Major labor unions and public organizations have sent representatives to demand that the government restore price controls and levy excessive profits taxes to reduce the huge profits of capitalists. The Canadian Progressive Labor Party (Communist Party), the Social Democratic Party, and the Labor Congress have also issued fierce protests, demanding that the government take effective measures.

　　加拿大物价在飞涨人民纷纷集会抗议
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】渥太华讯：加拿大正遭受物价高涨与通货膨胀之威胁。依照上月初之统计，加食粮价格较战前猛涨百分之七十四，衣料涨了百分之五十七，最近一周内若干食物竟有飞涨一倍以上者。官方材料透露物价飞涨之原因，主要为通货膨胀，及大制造商之操纵渔利。据加商务部公布，加拿大三九年之货币流通额仅为二十八亿元，目前则达七十五亿元。在百物飞腾之下，人民生活日益恶化，即以政府的统计为例，加拿大一个工人的家庭每周最低需用四十三元，而工资则每周不足三十五元，至于十万六千失业工人，则更挣扎于饥饿线上。因此，目前加境各地均发生抗议集会，政府每日收到的抗议函电有如雪片。各大工会及公共团体纷纷派出代表，要求政府恢复物价管制，征收过分利得税，以减少资本家的巨额利润。加进步工党（共产党）、社会民主党及劳工大会等，亦发表激烈抗议，要求政府采取有效措施。
