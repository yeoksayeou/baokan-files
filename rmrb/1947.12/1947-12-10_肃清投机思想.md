　　Purging Speculative Thought

In all our work, we must establish poor and hired peasant backbones and pay attention to solving the difficulties of poor and hired peasants. Our news reports should also serve the poor and hired peasants, eulogize and commend their struggles to turn the tables, and severely criticize all behaviors that oppress the poor and hired peasants and disregard their interests. However, without a firm class stance and a clear poor and hired peasant perspective, one will not be able or willing to conduct in-depth investigations, speak for the poor and hired peasants with clear likes and dislikes, and report the true content of events in detail. Some even treat the words "poor and hired peasants" as fashionable decorations, fabricating them out of thin air and casually attaching them to news reports. All of this is extremely wrong.

According to the newspaper inspection in November, it was discovered that many news reports and headlines merely carried the words "poor and hired peasants" but were empty in content and vague in facts. Upon careful analysis, these news reports were clearly unrealistic and perfunctory. For example, the news on page two of the 23rd about Wang Village's poor and hired peasants taking the lead in developing sideline production began by narrating the importance of clearing up muddled thinking and winter production. Then, it immediately stated that a movement was launched "with poor and hired peasants as the backbone." However, the entire article does not show any activities of the poor and hired peasants or the specific manifestations of their backbone role. How exactly did they "immediately" become the backbone? Who "used" them as the backbone? Was it truly the poor and hired peasant backbone that played a leading role in the village's winter production? All of this is vague. The news on the 24th about Yangcheng District Six completing half a month of autumn plowing in ten days mentioned that the achievement was due to "the poor and hired peasants in power from the district to the village." Although some examples were given below to illustrate that a certain village's mutual aid team was completely controlled by the poor and hired peasants and that a certain mutual aid team was led by the poor and hired peasants, the claim that "from the district to the village" all were "poor and hired peasants in power" is obviously unreliable. Similar news items exist in submissions from various districts, and it is impossible to list them all.

In our editorial work, we also have a blurred stance and do not truly understand the significant meaning of the poor and hired peasants being in power, as well as the obstacles and serious struggles that will inevitably be encountered when the poor and hired peasants truly come to power. We regard the poor and hired peasants being in power as an easy task, satisfied with individual poor and hired peasants becoming cadres or team leaders, without asking about the actual content, whether they truly have power, and whether the entire poor and hired peasant class has become the backbone in work. Therefore, we lightly believe a few empty words and try to adopt such manuscripts as much as possible, so that the newspaper is filled with the words "poor and hired peasants," as if the poor and hired peasants in various places are all in power and all kinds of work are very perfect. In reality, this deceives the readers, has a paralyzing effect on work, and harms the interests of the poor and hired peasants. This is very wrong and reflects a speculative thought lacking a clear class perspective. We hope that all branch offices and correspondents will also attach importance to this error, conduct in-depth self-examination, and make self-criticisms. At the same time, we eagerly expect the poor and hired peasants to strictly inspect the newspapers, file complaints about reports that distort the actual situation and deceive you and harm your interests, and expose the true situation.

### 肃清投机思想

　　肃清投机思想
    在我们所有工作中，都要树立贫雇骨干，注意解决贫雇困难。我们的通讯报导，亦要为贫雇服务，歌颂与表扬他们的翻身斗争，并严厉抨击欺压贫雇漠视贫雇利益的一切行为。但如果没有坚定的阶级立场，没有明确的贫雇观点，就不会或不愿深入调查，爱憎鲜明的替贫雇说话，详细报导出事情的真实内容来。甚至有的把贫雇二字当作时髦装饰，无中生有，随便把它按在新闻通讯中，这都是十分错误的。
    根据十一月份报纸检查，发现不少仅仅带上贫雇字眼，而内容空泛，事实糊涂的新闻与标题，经仔细分析，这些新闻通讯显然都是不符实际情况的客里空报导。如：二十三号二版王庄贫雇带头开展副业消息，开始叙述了打通糊涂思想及冬季生产的重要后，接着就来了个“当即以贫雇为骨干”开展起运动来，但全文中看不出贫雇的任何活动和其骨干作用的具体表现，究竟怎样“当即”就成了骨干？谁来“以”其为骨干？该村冬季生产中是否真正是贫雇骨干起了带头作用？都是糊涂的。二十四号阳城六区半月秋垡十天完成消息，报导中提到成绩的取得是因“由区到村贫雇当权”，下边虽举了些例子说明某村互助组完全贫雇当权，某互助组由贫雇领导等，但所谓“由区到村”都是“贫雇当权”，显然是不可靠的。类似这样的新闻，各区来稿都有，实在举不胜举。
    我们编辑工作中，亦由于立场模糊，不真正了解贫雇当权的重大意义，以及贫雇真正当权所会碰到的阻挠与必经的严重斗争。把贫雇当权看作轻而易举的事情，满足于个别贫雇当了干部或组长，而不问实际内容如何，是否真正当了权，是否整个贫雇阶层都成为工作中的骨干，因此轻信几句空话，尽量采用这类稿件，以致报面上充满了贫雇字眼，似乎各地贫雇都当了权，各种工作都十分完善。实际上，欺骗了读者，对工作起了麻痹作用，损害了贫雇利益。这是非常错误的，这是缺乏明确阶级观点的投机思想的反映。我们希望各分社与通讯员同志，亦应重视这种错误，进行深入检讨，并作自我批评。同时我们热切期待贫雇农民，严格的检查报纸，把歪曲实际情况的以及欺骗你们、损害你们利益的报导，提出控告，并把真实情形揭露出来。
