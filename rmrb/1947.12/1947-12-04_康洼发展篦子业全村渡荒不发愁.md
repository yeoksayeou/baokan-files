　　Kangwa Develops Comb Industry, Entire Village Overcomes Famine Without Worry
    [Report from Jinan, Hebei, 2nd] The masses in Kangwa, Hengshui, are developing the village's special handicraft, the comb industry. The village has 103 households with 486 men and women. Each person has an average of just over two mu of land, and the annual agricultural income is not enough to cover the whole year's living expenses. Before the incident [likely referring to the war], there were comb workshops in the village. After the Japanese surrendered, they were not restored, and the poor masses gradually could not maintain their lives. In the first month of this year, four private workshops and one cooperative workshop were opened in the village. After the autumn review, the wages of the workers and the dividends of the merchants totaled five million yuan. During the autumn grain collection, the masses said: "This year, our poor members didn't worry about paying public grain. We still haven't used up the rice we earned from wages. If it weren't for the comb workshops, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to get through the winter." Because the autumn harvest was very bad this year, the masses' lives depend even more on the workshops. This winter, they voluntarily stipulated the following agreement: (1) Statistics were taken of more than 40 poor members without skills, and they were divided into eight groups. The combs issued by the workshops do not require capital, and are sold at a 90% discount on the wholesale price. After the money is handed in, any remaining goods are returned. Members, both men and women, who have skills, as well as children, work at any time after completing household chores. (2) The wage prices of each workshop are consistent, and are decided by discussion among all the workers. Regardless of the size of the work, it is increased by 100 yuan compared to the spring. (3) There is no limit to the amount of share capital, and members can invest their surplus wages at any time. (4) The finished products from each workshop are sold uniformly by the cooperative (in order to keep the prices of goods from each workshop consistent). According to the village's preliminary accounts, it can generate 300,000 yuan in turnover every day. Compared with last year, 80% of households did not have enough to live on last year, but this year all of them will be able to get through the spring famine.

　　康洼发展篦子业全村渡荒不发愁
    【本报冀南二日电】衡水康洼群众，发展该村特种手艺篦子业。该村一百零三户，男女四百八十六人，每人平均二亩多地，每年农业收入不够全年的生活。事变前该村有篦子作坊，日寇投降后，没有恢复，贫苦群众已渐渐没法维持生活。今年正月村里开了四个私人作坊，一个合作社作坊。秋后总结，工人工资及商贩红利，共得五百万元。秋征中群众说：“今年咱们贫苦会员交公粮没发愁，得的工资米还用不清哩。要没有篦子作坊，恐怕弄不了个冬饱。”因今秋年景很坏，群众生活更需依靠作坊。今冬自愿规定了公约：（一）统计贫苦会员没手艺的四十多人，分了八组，发作坊的篦子不用资本，按批发价九扣，卖出交款，剩回退货。有手艺的男女会员和小孩，完成家庭杂活后，随时作工。（二）各作坊工资价格一致，全体工人讨论决定。无论大小工，比春季增加一百元。（三）股金不限制，会员剩余工资可随时入股。（四）各作坊出的成品，归合作社统一售出（为了各作坊货品价格一致）。该村初步结帐，每天能出三十万元流水。与去年比较起来，去年百分之八十户的生活不足，今年则全部可渡过春荒。
