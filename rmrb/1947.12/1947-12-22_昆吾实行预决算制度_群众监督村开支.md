　　[Reported by our newspaper from the JiluYu area on the 20th] Since Kunwu villages implemented the budgeting and final accounting system, waste has been greatly reduced. Since the county government proposed streamlining village burdens and having the masses supervise and control expenditures, establishing a new expenditure system, the financial and grain assistants in various districts were initially not very receptive, believing that passing through the masses was merely a formality. However, practical experience has proven that a democratic financial expenditure system is a powerful weapon for streamlining village burdens. Since its implementation began in August, various districts have made new innovations. For example, Districts 1, 2, 6, and 7 have all implemented a village budgeting and final accounting system. A financial committee is established in both the district and the village. In the district, it is composed of the district secretary, district head, and financial and grain assistant. In the village, it is composed of the village chief, political instructor, and director of the farmers' association. New accounts have also been established in District 4. The specific method in the villages is as follows: At the beginning of every three months, the village financial committee prepares a budget, which is approved by the mass meeting and then sent to the district financial committee for approval before any expenditure is made. At the end of the three months, a final account of the expenditures during the three months is prepared, which is also passed item by item at the mass meeting and sent to the district for verification and cancellation. If the budget is exceeded, the village cadres are held responsible. Since this has been implemented, corruption and waste have been greatly reduced. For example, Wang Micheng Village in District 1 was previously the most wasteful village, but since the implementation of the budgeting and final accounting system, the expenditure has been only half a jin of grain per mu in the three months from August to October. No other village has exceeded one jin.
    [Reported by our newspaper from the JiluYu area on the 16th] After the village financial reorganization in Hanshiqiao Village, Yunju Fourth District, the basic mass burden has been reduced by two-thirds compared to before. This village is a large village with 630 households and over 2,500 people, and suffered the most from enemy destruction during several seesaw battles. Since the enemy retreated from Juye, the village immediately began financial clearing work. The county government specially sent a financial cadre to help with the clearing, delving into the poor peasants to understand the reasons for the excessive burden on the masses: first, the village cadres became detached from the masses and indulged in lavish eating and drinking during the long period of seesaw battles; second, the apportionment of grain and money for aiding the enemy was unreasonable; and third, the procedures for war service expenditures were unclear, and the village cadres took advantage of loopholes in some places. Finally, the whole village resolved that the expenses incurred by the village cadres in dealing with the enemy should be borne by the village; the grain and money voluntarily contributed to the enemy by wealthy households should be shared by the wealthy households themselves; and the ransom for those who did not run away when the enemy came and were captured should be borne by the individuals themselves. Regarding war service expenditures, only those verified by the masses are allowed to be reimbursed. After this clearing, the burden on the masses was reduced by two-thirds.

　　昆吾实行预决算制度
  　群众监督村开支
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】昆吾各村自实行预决算制度后，大大克服了浪费现象。自县府提出整理村负担，由群众监督和掌握，建立新的开支制度后，当初各区财粮助理员思想不大通，认为通过群众只是形式。经过实验证明，民主的财经开支制度，是整理村负担的有力武器，自八月份开始实行以来，各区都有了新的创造。如一、二、六、七各区，都实行村预决算制度，区村都成立财政委员会，区由区书、区长、财粮助理员组成，村由村长，政指、农会主任组成。在四区亦都建立了新帐目，村中具体的办法是：每三个月初，由村财委会造一预算，经群众大会通过，再送区财委会批准，然后开支。到三个月终了，将三个月中的开支情形造一决算，同样召开群众大会逐条通过，并送区核准销帐。如超过预算，由村干负责。这样实行以来，大大克服了贪污浪费现象，如一区王密城，从前是个最浪费的村庄，自实行了预决算制度，八月至十月三个月内，每亩只合半斤粮的开支，其他村庄也没有超过一斤的。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】郓巨四区汉石桥村整理村财政后，基本群众负担较前减轻三分之二。该村是个较大的村庄，有六百三十户人家，二千五百余口人，几次拉锯中受敌摧残最重。自巨野敌人走后，该村即进行财政清理工作，县府特派一财经干部帮助清理，深入贫农中了解群众负担过重的原因有三：一、是村干部在长期拉锯中，脱离群众，大吃二喝；二、是资敌粮款摊派不合理；三、战勤开支手续不清，村干有些地方钻空子。最后全村决议，村干不得已应付敌人的花销，由村负担；富户主动资敌粮款，由富户自己均摊；敌人来时不跑而被抓走，赎款由本人负责。关于战勤开支，凡经群众证明的，方准报销。经过这一清理后，群众减少负担三分之二。
