[Taiyue News, December 12th] Villages in the Fourth District of Hongdong are universally engaged in winter production, with 800 women participating in spinning and weaving. Cui Lianxiang, chairman of the Likai Women's Association, upon returning from a meeting in the district, first mobilized three people to form a spinning and weaving team. In seven days, they spun five jin of yarn, earning a net profit of 5,700 yuan. She then used this accounting method to mobilize women, expanding to seven teams with a total of forty-three people. In Ji Village, due to the poor peasants and hired hands holding leadership, thirty-five women were also organized for spinning and weaving. Kongyu Village adhered to the principle of gradual and voluntary participation, initially developing twenty-one people to participate in spinning and weaving. Later, due to discussions on the method of equal value exchange and profit sharing based on work points, everyone felt satisfied, and by the morning of the fifth day, the number increased to forty-three people. In order not to delay learning, they used bricks or window panels from the spinning wheels as blackboards, writing words on them. Elementary school teachers were responsible for explaining and changing the content every three days, making it a typical example of combining women's spinning and weaving with winter literacy in the district. As of the 14th, according to reports from various villages, a total of 802 women (accounting for over 60% of the total number of spinners) and 115 spinning and weaving teams have been organized throughout the district. In the wave of spinning and weaving, even women who have not participated in spinning and weaving have automatically started spinning. In addition, 923 livestock and 602 male full laborers in various villages in the district have also started engaging in transportation. There are three reasons for the winter production upsurge in the district: 1. Importance was attached to the peasants' urgent desire to become prosperous; 2. The district promptly disseminated the experiences and achievements created in Kongyu and other villages to other villages; 3. The mass blackboards and broadcasting stations set up in various villages at this time mainly reported on winter production, encouraging the masses' spinning, weaving, and transportation work. The results are now expanding.

    洪洞四区创造经验推动各村
    冬季生产普遍展开
    【本报太岳十二日电】洪洞四区各村，普遍卷入冬季生产，八百妇女参加纺织。里开妇女会主席崔连象，从区上开会回去后，首先动员了三个人成立了一个纺织小组，七天便纺线五斤，除本赚洋五千七百元，她又用这种算帐方法，动员妇女，就扩大了七个组，共四十三个人。吉村由于雇贫掌握了领导权，也组织了三十五个妇女进行纺织。孔峪村掌握了由小到大自愿加入的原则，先发展了二十一人参加纺织，后因讨论以等价交换按工分红的办法，大家都感到满意，到第五天上午增加到四十三人，她们为了不误学习，将压纺车的砖或窗门当成黑板，上边写上字，由小学教员负责，三天讲解一次换一次，成了该区妇女纺织和冬学相结合的典型。截止十四号，据各村陆续汇报材料，全区组织起来的妇女共八百零二人（占纺妇总人数的百分之六十强）、一百一十五个纺织小组，在纺织热潮下，连未参加纺织的妇女，也都自动纺织起来。另外，该区各村并有九百二十三头牲口、六百零二个男全劳力，已开始搞运输。该区造成冬季生产热潮的原因有三：一、重视了农民迫切的发家要求；二、区上在孔峪等村创造经验和成绩，及时传播各村；三、各村设的大众黑板与广播台，这一时期的内容都是报导冬季生产为主，鼓励了群众的纺织运输工作，现成绩正在扩大中。
