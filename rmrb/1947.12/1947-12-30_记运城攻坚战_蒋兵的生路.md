　　Record of the Yuncheng Campaign
  　The Chiang Soldiers' Way Out
    Zhang Keren
    On the night of the 17th, when the People's Liberation Army's thousands of troops pressed directly to the outskirts of Yuncheng, they heralded good news: Yuncheng would quickly return to the people. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were still fantasizing about using the eight-zhang-high commanding point, the "Flour Company," in the north of the city to buy a moment of respite. Therefore, they ordered them to defend this position to the death. Fearing that the order would not be followed, they resorted to bribery, promising each soldier a reward of 10,000 yuan for guarding it for one night. However, this could not solve the fatal wound of Chiang's soldiers' lack of fighting spirit.

    When a burst of wild dog barking came from the lowest level of the Flour Company, the defending enemy sensed impending doom and frantically attempted to resist with fierce firepower. At this moment, the People's fighters were fearlessly surging forward. Li Wujin skillfully led the engineers to scout the terrain from the southern wing of the Flour Company. When Li Guoxing charged in, although the enemy blocked the way with dense firepower, he resolutely shouted: "Comrades, be determined, charge up, and resolutely complete the mission!" At this time, one hero after another fearlessly charged into the barrage. Tian Benni repeatedly traversed the fire net, and Luo Chunshan, a new soldier of the Eighth Company, also felt his way in with explosives. In the glare of exploding grenades, Li Guoxing, like an iron man, completed his sacred task amidst the flying shrapnel. When he walked out of the dangerous area with a victorious smile, the northeast corner of the Flour Company, along with a thundering explosion, saw bricks and stones flying, the enemy and the machine guns they were firing were destroyed simultaneously, and the few surviving enemies were also driven to a state of mental breakdown, staring blankly at the heroic figures of the People's Liberation Army active around the city.

    After two consecutive nights of blasting, the enemy who stubbornly defended the Flour Company was like a frightened bird. They no longer regarded this as a fortification to protect themselves, but as their terrifying cage. At night, the enemy platoon that had just been rotated in requested a replacement guard at dawn, but their superiors had long prepared to use them as cannon fodder, so how could they allow it? Their defense was weak, and when only five people remained, and the squad leader was wounded, their superiors still wanted them to defend it for five days. Needless to say five days, "they can't even hold it for five hours!"

    Death seriously threatened them, but Bai Shuyun, one of them, suddenly thought of a way out of the dead end, which was to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. However, they still had some doubts in their hearts. At night, three loud sounds came from the northeast direction: "Surrender or not! If you don't surrender, we'll use a thousand pounds of explosives to blow you up!" This shouting, in their panicked hearts, brought unlimited vitality, and they timidly said: "Don't dare to blow us up, we'll hand over our guns!" At this time, Comrade Dong Xingxue sincerely granted their request, and they safely climbed down a thick rope and threw themselves into the arms of the people.

　　记运城攻坚战
  　蒋兵的生路
    张克仁
    十七号夜里，当人民解放军的千军万马直逼运城郊外的时候，预告给人们一个喜讯——运城将是迅速回到人民手里的一座城市。就在这时候，蒋匪还在幻想着以城北八丈高的制高点“面粉公司”，换取残喘的一息。因此，命令死守这块阵地，又怕命令不行，来了一个金钱收买，允许每个士兵守备一夜得一万元的奖金。可是，这都不能解决蒋匪士兵无斗志的致命伤。
    当面粉公司的最基层，传出一阵野狗叫的时候，守备的敌人，预感到大祸临头，仓慌的企图用猛烈的火力顽抗。这时间，人民战士正无畏的向前涌进。李五斤熟悉的率领工兵，由南翼突进面粉公司侦察地形，当栗国兴突入时，虽然敌人用稠密的火力封锁住去路，他却毅然的喊着：“同志们，拿定决心，冲上去，坚决完成任务！”这时，一个个勇士，奋不顾身冲进火网。田本泥一次又一次的在火网里穿行，八连新战士罗春山，也揣着炸药摸进去。在手榴弹爆烈的火光中，栗国兴象一条铁汉，在纷飞的弹片中完成着自己神圣的任务。当他带着胜利的微笑，走出危险地区时，面粉公司东北角，已随着雷鸣的爆炸声，砖石乱飞，敌人和他们正在发射的机枪同时毁灭，残存的几个敌人，也被炸得神经失常，呆头呆脑地望着活跃在城周的人民解放军的英姿。
    一连两夜的爆破，凭坚据守面粉公司的敌人，已如惊弓之鸟，他们再也不认为这是保护自己的工事，而当作他们可怕的囚笼。到夜里，刚换来的一班敌人，拂晓时就请示上级给调换守备，可是他们的上级老早就准备把他们当炮灰，那儿能允许呢。他们守备薄弱，直到剩下五个人，班长又被打伤了时，他们的上司还要他们死守五天，不用说五天，“就是五小时也守不住了！”
    死，严重地威胁着他们，可是他们中间的一个白树云，忽然由死路中想出了一条生路，那就是向人民解放军投降。可是，他们的心里还有些疑虑。夜里，东北方向传来了三阵响亮的声音：“投降不投降！不投降要用一千斤炸药炸你！”这次的喊话，在他们恐慌不安的心里，却带来了无限的生机，他们怯生生的说：“不敢炸，我们缴枪啦！”此时，董兴学同志诚意的允许了他们的请求，他们就随着一条粗壮的绳，安然的爬了下来，投到了人民的怀抱里。
