　　Ideological Mobilization for Conscious and Voluntary Enrollment
    ——Summary of the Enrollment Campaign in Xiyang

    This enrollment in Xiyang was larger than any previous one, and the quality of the recruits was better in terms of physique than ever before. In the process, many new leadership methods based on the mass line were created. The following is a discussion in three stages:

    The first stage was the initial mobilization stage.

    After receiving the enrollment assignments, most districts conducted discussions on current events and land reform, recalled the suffering of the past, recognized the crimes of the landlords and Chiang Kai-shek, and enlightened the class consciousness of the masses and cadres to the consciousness of enrollment. In Jiandu Village, First District, 41 young adults voluntarily signed up to join the army. The women's rescue secretary of Shiping sent her sweetheart to capture Chiang Kai-shek, which influenced the entire district, and within three days, 685 young adults enthusiastically joined the counter-offensive army. In Duzhuang, Mahui, Hongshui, Nanyu, Lujiayu, and other villages in the Second District, based on discussions of current events, recollections of history, and accusations of suffering, 99 people voluntarily signed up for the army overnight. Within two days, 120 young adults in the entire Second District signed up.

    Typical examples were found in the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Districts. Zhao Chaoming, a land reform hero from the Fourth District, voluntarily signed up to go to the front line. Zhang Wenke, the political director of Panyu in the Sixth District (himself a veteran), whose third brother was still in the army, voluntarily mobilized his fourth brother to join the army. Zhan Shanghe and Xi Chang, both Communist Party members, voluntarily signed up. In the Eighth District, nine people signed up for the army in Dongxi Wuchuan in one night.

    In short, during this period, through current events discussions, recollections of historical suffering, class consciousness was enlightened, and the idea of "doing one's own thing" was recognized. The masses themselves stipulated the conditions for enrollment, such as not accepting those who were not land-reform peasants, those who were not politically clean, and those who were not physically strong.

    The second stage was the promotion and popularization stage:

    After the first stage of current events discussions, recollections of historical suffering, and cultivation of poor peasant and farmhand backbones, a foundation was laid for the second stage of the enrollment upsurge. During this stage, the leadership focused on grasping typical examples and using them for promotion. Therefore, there were many creations and developments. Most villages had street bulletin boards, and districts and counties restored enrollment news reports, leading the enrollment movement to a climax. From October 25th to November 1st, within seven days, 1,128 young adults who had been emancipated signed up for the army. Land-reform peasants' forums were held in various districts and villages. Through current events discussions and recollections of historical suffering, the organization of shock autumn plowing was promoted. During the day, in mutual aid groups, current events were discussed and enrollment was considered, while land was cultivated, constantly increasing awareness and continuing to sign up. The masses themselves created large meetings, small meetings, and discussions during meals, sleep, and walking, chanting slogans such as "Thoroughly emancipate ourselves and dig out the roots to join the victorious counter-offensive army."

    However, some districts carried a burden of complacency and did not start with ideological mobilization, so they did not conduct enough research, resulting in the phenomenon of "grabbing a handful." For example, after receiving the assignment, the leadership in the XX district thought there would be no difficulties because they had experience in enrollment in the past and people would sign up without mobilization. However, by the time other districts had completed their preliminary work, the XX district had just made arrangements, but they did not study them well. As a result, due to the short time and the stimulation from other districts, simple methods were used more. Some villages held a purely numerical view of completing the task and resorted to forced enrollment. For example, the XXhui Village in the Fourth District was originally assigned two people. The village cadres assigned the numbers to the village. The elderly said that this was a matter for young people and they did not need to worry about it. The cadres only said that joining the army would provide two meals of white flour a day and three sets of new clothes a year. Some young people replied: "If it's so good, why don't you go?" When there was no other way, Gou Xiaocai, the political director, signed up, but no one went. At this time, the village cadres mobilized a few people and forcibly dragged nine people to join the army. However, after arriving in the county, one said: "I'm not going." Another said: "If you're not going, I'm not going either." Because it was not conscious and voluntary, but forced, the county let them all go back.

    The third stage was the consolidation and review stage:

    After enrollment, new soldiers' forums were held in each village, district, and base point to consolidate the soldiers' morale. For example, Comrade Wang Fuyuan of the Shipeng base point in the First District led the convening of a new soldiers' base point meeting, paying attention to the difficulties of the new soldiers. Most of the difficulties that could be resolved were resolved. For example, various villages in the Second District conducted reviews of preferential treatment for military families. Many reviews revealed the idea of ​​shirking work when cultivating land on behalf of military families. After specific reviews, concrete plans were made for future preferential treatment work.

    Because of the above consolidation work, the soldiers made plans to kill the enemy at the mass meeting, vowing not to return until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated, and took an oath. Therefore, the morale of the soldiers, the masses, and the military dependents was very high.

    After stabilizing the morale in the villages, they were immediately concentrated in the districts. Each district made a preliminary review, and after returning a portion in each district, they were sent to the county, totaling 1,893 people. After review in the county, 702 people were returned, and 1,192 people actually went to the troops.

    This review also proved that our soldiers had the strongest quality conditions and physique. To give an example, of the 1,192 people actually enlisted in the army in the county (all land-reform peasants), none were from landlord families. Several effective methods were also discovered in this review and consolidation. In advance, the county party committee, the county government, and the county armed forces committee jointly organized a consolidation and review committee, divided into two sections, one administrative section and one organizational section; the administrative section was responsible for life, accommodation, and hospitality, and the organizational section was responsible for review, registration, and propaganda. First, the organizational section and the county party committee jointly determined the standards for soldiers: those who were not politically clean, those who were not in good physical condition, those who were under the age of eighteen or over thirty, were not accepted; those who were from landlord families were not accepted; and those whose enrollment was not based on conscious and voluntary basis were not accepted. After the conditions were stipulated, the organizational section participated in each company in groups of three to five people together with district cadres to establish groups to collectively study and each assume their responsibilities.

    The general review took various forms. For example, the Fourth District, as a company, first coordinated with the activists in the village to conduct a preliminary investigation of the situation in order to understand who was from a landlord family, who was not voluntary, and who had political problems. After understanding, detailed registration was made, and then a soldiers' meeting was held to discuss the importance and purity of the people's army (a class team), and democratic discussions were held. Based on the awakening of class consciousness, appropriate streamlining was carried out. Many of those who were not upright and those who were from landlord families were automatically proposed by the masses to be returned to the village for production. The Second District used a meticulous review method, and finally conducted democratic discussions and streamlined the team through everyone; another method was the opposite of the above two, standing in line, and using the formation to conduct selection. Therefore, some soldiers were suspicious in their thinking. Some did not want to go back but were forced to go back, and some did not want to go but were forced to go. Some of those who were returned reflected that they did not even have the qualifications to be a soldier, and they would not come again if there was another expansion. This simple method is not good. The biggest lesson learned from this conscription was that too many were recruited. More than 1,800 came to the county, and more than 700 were returned. Therefore, some soldiers suffered blows in their morale and thinking. If the method was not paid attention to, residual problems would be created, creating obstacles for future conscription. The reason is that the ideological methods of our cadres from top to bottom all have a distrust of the masses. The county allocated 300 more, the district allocated 500 more, and the village said half more. If they were not controlled, they would inevitably exceed the numbers. The result was a waste of labor and increased expenses.

    Several experiences and lessons

    1.  Mastered the ideological leadership of the mass line, created a new method of solving problems from the ideological perspective, broke the old style of hard conscription and squeezing, and clearly proposed mastering the three leadership focuses in the three stages: the first stage focused on mobilization, the second stage focused on promotion and popularization, and the third stage focused on review and consolidation. After the task was assigned, it was necessary to clearly put forward slogans and determine that those who were from landlord families and those who were not politically clean were not accepted, and the focus was placed on land-reform peasants.

    2.  Two styles and two results of completing the task: One is hard and meticulous, solving problems from the ideological perspective of the masses, which has won the support of the masses and the praise of the superiors. For example, the First, Second, Third, and Eighth Districts, under the resounding slogan of "Thoroughly emancipate ourselves and dig out the roots," mobilized the masses from the ideological perspective, from class consciousness to conscription consciousness. When the masses consciously demanded to join the army, the leadership let go and carried out current events education, and put forward the conscription task on the basis of conscious voluntariness. For example, the Third District discussed current events for two nights and signed up 99 people; the other method is a simple style of not working hard, which produced administrative orders and the phenomenon of "grabbing a handful."

    In short, all those who followed the former method completed the task quickly and well, and the masses were further mobilized, laying a favorable foundation for future work. All those who adopted the latter method did not mobilize the masses, and the task was not completed quickly, and the quality was not good, so it was either dragged or forced, so it was not consolidated.

    3.  One lesson from this conscription campaign is that the leadership lags behind the ideological development of the masses. In the past, the Second and Eighth Districts lagged behind other districts in conscription. At that time, the leadership believed that the task of the Second and Eighth Districts would not be easy to complete, so they did not control the distribution numbers. As a result, it exceeded 80% or more, which increased difficulties in expenditure and caused great undue waste in labor and food and drink. Because of the large number of expansions and many returns, the new soldiers were stimulated in their morale. In particular, the unconcerned method of returning had a bad impact on future conscription.

　　思想发动自觉自愿
    ——昔阳参军运动总结
    昔阳这次参军，比任何一次都多，而且比历来的质量体格都好，在进行中创造了不少的群众路线新的领导方法，下面分三个阶段来谈：
    第一阶段为入手发动阶段。
    在各区接到参军任务后，大部都进行了谈时事论翻身，回忆历史所受的痛苦，认识了地主与蒋介石的罪恶，启发了群众干部的阶级自觉到参军自觉。一区建都村有四十一名青壮年自动报名参军，石坪妇救秘书送亲郎捉老蒋，影响了全区三日内有六百八十五名青壮年踊跃参加了反攻军。二区杜庄、麻会、洪水、南峪、路家峪等村在讨论时事回忆历史诉苦的基础上，一夜自动报名参军的九十九名。二区二天内全区有一百二十个青壮年报名参军。
    四、六、八区都发现了典型，四区翻身英雄赵超明自动报名上前线，六区畔峪政治主任张文科（本人是荣誉军人）他三弟现还在部队，但他自动的动员了他四弟参军，沾上和喜昌是共产党员自动报名参了军，八区东西五川一晚上参军报名九个。
    总之在这段经过时事座谈，回忆历史痛苦启发了阶级觉悟，认识了自己事自己干。群众自己规定了参军条件，如不是翻身农民不要，政治不清白的不要，体格不坚强的不要。
    第二阶段为推广普及阶段：
    经过第一段的座谈时事，回忆历史痛苦，培养了贫雇骨干，给第二段参军高潮打下了基础。在这段领导重点主要放在掌握典型运用典型进行推广，因此有不少的创造与发挥，村里大部都出了街头——大众黑板、区县都恢复了参军捷报，参军运动走向高潮，十月廿五日至十一月一日七天内，全县翻身青壮年报名参军的一千一百廿八名，各区各村均召开了翻身农民座谈会，经过时事座谈忆历史痛苦，促进了组织起来突击秋耕，白天在互助组中一面酝酿时事讨论参军，一面生产耕地，不断提高了觉悟，继续报名。群众自己创造了大会小会，饭场睡觉走路都进行了酝酿，走路也念道着翻透身刨老根，参加反攻胜利军。
    但是有个别区背着自满包袱，不从思想发动入手，因此研究不够，产生抓一把的现象，如××区接到任务后，领导上就以为没有啥困难，因过去有参军的经验，不用动员就会有人报名。可是等到各区都已初步完成了，××区才作了布置，但也没很好研究，结果由于时间短了，又受到外区的刺激，简单方法就更多了，有个别村抱着单纯完成数目字的任务观点，来硬抓硬派，如四区××会村原分配数两个，村干部照数派到村里，老年人说这是青年的事不用咱操心，干部光说参军一天吃两顿白面，一年穿三套新衣裳，有些青年就回答：这样好你们不去？逼到没办法的时候，政治主任狗小才报名参了军，但是还没人去，这时村干部发动了几个人硬蹩起九个参了军，但到县后这个说：不当了，我不去。那个也说你不去了我也不去。因不是自觉自愿，而是蹩起来的，所以县上就让他们都回去了。
    第三段为巩固审查阶段：
    各村在报名以后，以区以村以基点，召开了新战士坐谈会，巩固了战士们的情绪，如一区石棚基点王富元同志领导召开了新战士基点会议，注意了新战士的困难，能解决的大部都做了解决，如二区各村都做了优抗检讨，有不少的检讨出给抗属代耕有磨洋工思想。经过具体检讨后，做了今后优抗工作具体计划。
    由于以上的各种巩固工作，所以战士在群众大会上订出了杀敌计划，打不倒蒋介石不回来，并做了宣誓。因此战士群众军属的情绪都很高。
    经过在村安定了情绪以后，马上集中到区，各区都作了初步审查，除在各区退回一部分外送到县，共人数一千八百九十三名，经在县审查退回七百零二名，实到部队的是一千一百九十二名。
    这次在审查中，也证明了我们的兵员质量条件体格最强，举一个例子就会看出，全县除精简外，实入伍的一千一百九十二个，大部是民兵（全部翻身农民），没有一个被斗户。这次在审查巩固中亦发现几种有效方法，预先，县委会，县政府，县武委会各机关统一的组织了一个巩固审查委员会，内分二个股，一个事务股，一个组织股；事务股负责生活住宿招待，组织股负审查登记，宣传鼓动，首先由组织股及县委会共同确定了兵员的标准，政治不清白、体格不好、年不满十八及三十岁以上的不要；地主尾巴户的不要，参军不是建筑在自觉自愿基础上的不要，条件规定后，组织股分头参加到各连队，配合区干部三五人不等的成立了小组，集体研究各负各责。
    一般审查是采取了多种多样的，如四区是一个连队，首先协同各班在村的积极分子，做情况的初步调查，以便了解那是尾巴户那些是不自愿的，那些是有政治问题的。经了解后作详细登记，然后召开军人大会，讨论人民军队重要性及纯洁性（是阶级队伍），民主讨论，在阶级觉悟起来的基础上进行了适当的精简，有好多不正派及尾巴户，群众自动的提出来让他回村进行生产。二区是用了细密的审查方法，最后进行了民主讨论，通过大家作了精简；另一种方式和上两种都是相反的，站队，以队形进行了抽拨，所以有些战士思想上起到了怀疑，有的不回硬推回去，有的不走硬让走了，退回去的就有些反映说：咱连当兵资格也没有了，再扩咱也不来了。这种简单方式是不好的。这次扩兵有一个最大教训，是扩的太多，到县一千八百多，就退回七百多个，因此有些战士在情绪上思想上受到打击，如方法不注意的就闹下了遗留问题，给今后扩军造下了障碍。追其原因在我们自上而下干部思想方法上，都存在着不相信群众，县多分配了三百，区多分配了五百个，村就多说一半，再不加以掌握，光怕来的少了，就必然的超过数字。结果是浪费了劳力，加重了开支。
    几点经验教训
    一、掌握了群众路线的思想领导，创造了从思想上解决问题的新方法，打破了过去硬扩硬挤的旧作风，明确的提出掌握了三个阶段中三个领导重点：第一段发动为主，第二段推广普及，第三段审查巩固。在任务布置后，必须是明确的提出口号来，并且确定了地主尾巴户政治不清白的不要，重点放在了翻身农民身上。
    二、完成任务的两种作风两种结果：一种是艰苦细密，从群众思想上解决问题的，都得到群众拥护、上级的表扬。如一、二、三、八区部在响亮的翻透身刨老根的口号下，从思想上把群众发动起来，由阶级自觉到参军自觉，群众在自觉要求参军的时候，领导上便放手的开展了时事教育，在自觉自愿基础上提出了参军任务，如三区两晚上扯时事报名九十九个；另一种方法是不艰苦的简单作风，便产生了行政命令，抓一把的现象。
    总之凡是照前一种办法的，任务完成的又快又好，群众亦进一步发动了，在今后工作上，亦打下有利的基础。凡是采取后一种方法的，群众没有发动了，任务完成的不快，质量也不好，所以不是蹩起来的便是硬拉起来的，因此也不巩固。
    三、这次参军运动一个教训，是领导落后于群众的思想发展，过去扩兵二、八区曾落后于其他区，那时在领导上就认为二、八区此次任务不好完成，因此就不去掌握分配数字了，结果超过了百分之八十以上，给开支上增加困难，使在人工上吃喝上都有很大的不应有的浪费，由于扩的多退的也多，给新战士在情绪上有了刺激。特别是退回时方法上不讲究，就给成今后参军遗留下不好的影响。
