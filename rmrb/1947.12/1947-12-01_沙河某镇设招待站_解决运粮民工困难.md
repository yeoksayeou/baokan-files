　　A Reception Station Established in a Town in Shahe
　　Solving the Difficulties of Grain-Transporting Laborers
　　[Our newspaper from Shahe] In order to provide conveniences such as cooking and lodging for the masses transporting grain, ×× town studied and established a reception station, with two sections: reception and supply. Each section has two to three people, responsible for reception, drinking water, cooking, allocating accommodations, indicating routes, and collecting/distributing/selling firewood, rice, flour, utensils, borrowing/returning items, and preparing boiling water...etc. They also organized elderly men and children who could not participate in voluntary transport to be responsible for odd jobs such as carrying water, burning firewood, and communicating. For the convenience of reception work, the entire town's four main streets were divided into four reception points. The specific reception and supply matters are as follows: At the east and west entrances of the village, five large pots are set up in each location, constantly preparing boiling water, with dedicated personnel for reception. Shops and restaurants are mobilized to sell home-style meals during the grain transport period, such as yellow steamed vegetable rice, rice, etc., with unified pricing. In order to avoid grain loss, women are organized to specialize in sewing up bags at the centralized rest areas for grain-transporting people. They also provide shoe repair for the grain-transporting people to solve difficulties and promote mutual love. During the discussion, everyone suggested that the lodging for grain transport should definitely be covered with mats and the windows should be properly covered. Some said that the laborers should be treated like brothers, promoting the spirit that all farmers are one family. Fearing that the laborers would take detours, road signs are placed at each intersection, writing how far away a certain village is, and indicating that there is a fork in the road that needs attention, etc. (Xinsheng, Mingliang, Qingwu)

　　沙河某镇设招待站
  　解决运粮民工困难
    【本报沙河讯】××镇为了使运粮群众得到做饭住屋等方便，研究设立招待站，下设招待与供应两股，每股设二人至三人，分别负责招待喝水做饭，分配住处、指示路途与收发代卖柴草米面用具、借还物品和开水准备……等，并组织不能参加义运之老汉儿童，负责担水烧火通信连络等零星工作。为招待工作的方便，以全镇四道街分为四个地点招待，其具体招待供应事宜如下：在村东村西各路口，各设置大锅五口，经常准备开水，有专门人员招待。发动店房饭铺，在运粮时期卖家常便饭，如黄蒸菜饭米饭等，统一规定价格。为了避免粮食损失，运粮群众集中休息地点，组织妇女专门缝补口袋。并给运粮群众钉补鞋，以解决困难发扬互爱。在讨论中，大家提出运粮住家一定要铺上席子挡好窗户，有的说待民工应该和弟兄一般。发扬天下农民是一家的精神。又怕民工往返绕路，在各路口都插有路牌，上写离某村多少远，某处有岔路须注意等。（新生、明亮、庆五）
