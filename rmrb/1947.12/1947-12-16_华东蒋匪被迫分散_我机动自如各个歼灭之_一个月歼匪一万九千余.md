Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: A comprehensive report on the East China war situation is as follows: The enemy is forced to disperse, and we annihilate them in their dispersal. This is the characteristic of the East China war situation recently. After the Jiahe victory, except for the more concentrated Kuomintang bandits along the Jiaodong coast, the rest are scattered in various places. We are nimble and annihilate them piece by piece. From November 6th to December 7th, news of victories poured in from south of the Yangtze River to the coast of the Bohai Sea. A total of 19,260 enemies were annihilated, including more than 5,200 Kuomintang security teams and local reactionary groups. Specifically: From November 6th to 17th, we blocked and attacked five and a half brigades of the Kuomintang 9th Reorganized Division and other units attempting to escape west between Gaomi and Weixian, annihilating more than 3,000 enemies. On the 27th, we captured Gaomi City, annihilating a regiment of the Kuomintang 64th Reorganized Division and local reactionary groups, totaling more than 1,800. From November 8th to December 6th, two brigades of the Kuomintang 54th Reorganized Division, trapped in a corner of Haiyang for a month, vainly attempted to break through, and over 3,200 were annihilated in successive engagements. The three enemy brigades attempting to reinforce Haiyang were ambushed by us from November 25th to December 2nd, 70 li northeast of Jimo, and more than 3,600 were annihilated. On the southern front: In the Libao and Jiaoxie campaign in central Jiangsu from the night of November 30th to the afternoon of December 3rd, a Kuomintang regiment and local reactionary groups, totaling more than 3,400, were annihilated. Our troops, taking advantage of the victory, moved south and captured the two strongly fortified strongholds of Matang and Wuzongbu on the 6th and 7th, annihilating nearly 1,000 Kuomintang security personnel. At the same time, our local military units also took the initiative to attack and achieved successive victories. Major examples include the battle of Chengqian in southern Shandong on November 9th, the battles of Yixian, Zaozhuang, and Pixian on the 17th and 18th, the raid on Shouguang City by our troops in Bohai on the 14th, the capture of Sixian in northern Jiangsu on the 21st, the battle of Xutang in the Binhai area on the 28th, and the battle of Shidian north of Xintai in central Shandong on December 5th, totaling more than 3,260 enemies annihilated. In one month, we captured many towns and Kuomintang strongholds, including Pingdu, Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Shouguang, Huangxian, Yixian, Pixian, Zaozhuang (after completing our tasks in Yixian, Pixian, and Zaozhuang, we proactively transferred), Sixian, Libao, Jiaoxie, Jiaoxie, Dingjiashuo, Matang, Wuzongbu, Xutang, Yangqiaotou, and Daliuzhuang. This fully reveals that the Kuomintang bandits are in a state of chaos and unable to cope with their overall defense. The Kuomintang bandits' desperate raids and looting in parts of northern Jiangsu, central Jiangsu, Binhai, southern Shandong, and central Shandong have been successively crushed and will continue to be crushed under the heroic attacks of our local soldiers and civilians.
