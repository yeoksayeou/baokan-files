　　Attempting to Salvage a Disastrous Situation
  　Bandit Chiang Flies to Beiping
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek flew to Beiping from Nanjing on the 26th. The Associated Press reported that Chiang's trip was to discuss the critical "military situation" in North China with the Chiang bandit's North China war generals. After arriving in Beiping, Chiang immediately summoned Li Zongren, the director of the Chiang bandit's Beiping Provisional Headquarters. Fu Zuoyi, the director of the Chiang bandit's Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters, and Sun Lianzhong, the director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, also rushed to Beiping on the 27th. Chiang held a meeting on the 27th that lasted until midnight. The Associated Press revealed that Chiang might once again "reorganize" the Chiang bandit's North China military institutions in order to eliminate officials Chiang does not trust. The Kuomintang's *New Life Daily* already believes that Chiang will use a "sharpened sword" to "strike" these officials.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th] Tianjin News: The Chiang bandits in Tianjin and Beiping were extremely panicked after the People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang. The day after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, namely the 14th, the Chiang bandits in Tianjin hastily announced an extension of the curfew by one and a half hours, starting from 10:30 p.m. until 6:00 a.m., and have been holding street fighting exercises for days, as if a major battle is imminent. The Chief of Staff of the Chiang bandit's 62nd Division made a false show of strength, shouting that "the defense is solid and there is no problem with security." After our army liberated Shijiazhuang, the spokesperson of the Chiang bandit's Beiping Provisional Headquarters announced the suspension of express trains between Beiping and Tianjin.

　　图挽惨败局势
  　蒋贼飞平
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】匪首蒋介石于二十六日由南京飞抵北平。合众社称：蒋此行系与蒋匪华北内战将领讨论其已呈危急的华北“军事形势”。蒋抵平后立即召见蒋匪北平行辕主任李宗仁，蒋匪张家口绥署主任傅作义，保定绥署主任孙连仲也于二十七日赶抵北平。二十七日蒋召开会议至午夜始散。美联社透露：蒋可能再来一次蒋匪华北军事机构的“改组”，以清除蒋所不信任的官员。国民党新生报已表示相信蒋会以“磨快的佩刀”向这些官员“开刀”。
    【新华社华东二十九日电】天津消息：人民解放军解放石家庄后，平津蒋匪甚为恐慌。石家庄解放后第二天，即十四日，天津蒋匪即仓惶宣布延长戒严时间一小时半，从晚上十时半开始，至天明六时解除，并连日举行巷战演习，宛如大战已逼眉睫。蒋匪整六十二师参谋长虚张声势，大叫“防务巩固，治安无问题”。北平蒋匪行辕发言人于我军解放石家庄后，宣布平津对开特快车停驶。
