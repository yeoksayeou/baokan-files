(This Dispatch from Taiyue, 19th) To facilitate vehicle traffic and transportation, the Sixth District of Qinshui has repaired 165 li of roads. In the past, only eight villages along the river, including Wu'an, Panzhuang, Lizhuang, Huojia Mountain, Guo Bi, Douzhuang, Duanzhuang, and Jiafeng, could be reached by vehicles. The remaining eleven villages were distributed on the mountains on the east and west sides, making them inaccessible to vehicles. Although the district had 848 cattle, it only had over 80 carts. The masses had to carry coal, deliver public grain, and transport production materials by shoulder pole, which was labor-intensive and failed to utilize the power of livestock, causing significant losses to production and transportation. In addition, the original roads were damaged by rain and could not be used. Therefore, starting on December 9th, the district organized manpower from various villages to repair 60 to 70 li of the original roads and opened five new roads, including Jiafeng to Yong'an, with a total length of 105 li. In this way, all parts of the district are accessible by vehicles. Currently, except for the three roads from Nanping to Yelang, Miaowa to Mazhuang, and Jiafeng to Yong'an, which have not yet been completed, the rest have been largely completed. This project makes a great contribution to transportation in the entire district. For example, if each village can use carts to transport coal to Duanshi for sale or for other short-distance transportation, and then use the saved labor for other production, the profits will be considerable.

　　沁水六区修路便利车辆运输
    【本报太岳十九日电】沁水六区为车辆通行，便利运输，修通车路一百六十五里。该区过去除武安、潘庄、李庄、霍家山、郭必、窦庄、段庄、加峰等沿河八村能通车外，其余十一个村都分布在东西两面山上，不能通车，全区虽有牛八百四十八头，仅有牛车八十余辆，群众运煤炭、送公粮与运输生产，都得用人担挑，既很费人力，又不能发挥牲畜力量，对生产运输都造成很大损失。又加原有车路亦被雨水冲坏，不能通行。该区遂于十二月九号起，组织各村人力，动手修补原有车路六七十里，并新辟贾峰通永安等五条新通车路，全长一百零五里。这样，全区四通八达，都可行车。现除南坪通野鹿，庙洼通马庄，贾峰通永安的三条尚未修通外，其余都已大致告竣。这一工程对全区交通上有很大贡献，如各村都能用车拉炭到端氏出卖，或作别的短途运输，再把节省下的劳力搞别的生产，其获利就很惊人了。
