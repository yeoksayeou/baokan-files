    Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 12th: With the deepening of land reform review in various parts of Central China, rural cultural and educational undertakings have seen significant development. Regarding books and newspapers: According to statistics from the Xinhua Bookstore in the Second Sub-district of Central Jiangsu, over the past six months, the entire sub-district sold more than 45,000 books, of which popular reading materials accounted for over 85%. The mass pictorial published by the People's Pictorial Publishing House is even more popular. As a result, numerous consignment points have sprung up everywhere. In Qintong County (formerly a town, now a county) alone, there are 24 fixed rural newspaper and book consignment points. Peasant theatrical troupes organized by the liberated peasants themselves are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In the Second Sub-district, 66 theatrical troupes have been spontaneously organized by various townships. Over the past year, the masses have created more than 40 complete popular plays and more than 10 types of ballad lyrics. Among them, plays such as "Look, Think" and "Seven and a Half," as well as various ballad lyrics, have received favorable reviews from the masses and awards from the sub-district Literary Association. The masses in various places have an exceptionally high enthusiasm for cultural learning. According to statistics from two districts in Hai'an and Qidong counties in September alone, there were more than 60 adult learning groups in various townships, with over 1,000 people participating in the learning. A peasant woman named Ji Zunlan has progressed from illiteracy to being able to read and write more than 1,000 characters in the past six months. The masses in Fuma Village, Zishi (newly established county, administered by Hai'an), jointly established a primary school and carefully selected teachers.

    华中土改深入后
    农村文教大发展
    【新华社华东十二日电】华中各地土改复查中，农村文教事业有显著发展，书报方面：据苏中二分区新华书店统计，半年来全分区销书四万五千余册，其中通俗读物占百分之八十五以上。人民画报社出版的大众画刊更受欢迎。因之各地代销处林立，仅溱潼（原镇改县）一县即有固定的农村书报代销处二十四处，翻身农民自己组织的农村剧团，更如雨后春笋。二分区各乡自动组织的剧团达六十六个。一年来群众自己创作完整的通俗剧本四十余部及鼓词十余种。其中“看看想想”“七块半”等剧本及鼓词多种，均获得群众好评及分区文协的奖金。各地群众文化学习情绪尤高，仅据海（门）启（东）县两个区九月份统计，各乡成人学习组即有六十多个，千余人参加学习。农妇季尊兰半年来由文盲进步到能读写一千字以上。紫石（新设县，治设海安）傅马村群众合力创办了一所小学，并慎重地选择了教师。
