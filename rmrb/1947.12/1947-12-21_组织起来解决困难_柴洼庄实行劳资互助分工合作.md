　　Organize to Overcome Difficulties
　　--Chaiwazhuang Implements Labor-Capital Mutual Aid and Division of Labor Cooperation
　　Zhu Dunliang
According to Yang Peiji, manager of the No. 1 Village Joint Credit Cooperative in the Fifth District of Yangcheng, among the more than one million loans he has lent to 430 households in the four administrative villages of Yubei, Haocun, Shendian, and Dongshan since July, there are only two rich peasant households, 412 middle peasant households, and only 16 poor peasant households, and the amount of loans to poor peasants is also small. This shows that the loans have not been lent to the hired poor. So he personally went to the countryside to talk to the hired poor and found that the hired poor had many difficulties in production, such as lack of livestock, lack of funds, lack of technology, lack of people, no way out for mutual aid, and they dared not take out loans, fearing that they would not be able to earn money to repay the principal. For example, Wei Qiurong, a poor peasant in Chaiwazhuang, said: "Every time I take out a loan, it is at most 2,000 yuan, and I dare not ask for more, fearing that I won't be able to repay it." Therefore, Manager Yang felt that simply giving loans to the hired poor could not solve their production difficulties, and that labor-capital mutual aid and division of labor cooperation must be implemented to solve the production difficulties of the hired poor. So he discussed with the cadres of Chaiwazhuang how to solve the production difficulties of the hired poor peasants. After several discussions and soliciting the opinions of the hired poor, everyone proposed to implement labor-capital integration and village-wide mutual aid, that is, to completely organize all the village's labor, animal power, funds, tools, and various technical workers into a large group, and then form various types of small groups according to each person's strengths, under the unified leadership of the large group leader. All difficulties are solved by the masses of the large group (i.e., the whole village). The money earned by each small group is handed over to the large group leader, and work is reported to the large group leader. At the end of the year, work is evaluated according to the work done, and dividends are distributed according to work points. This method was discussed by the masses of the whole village for more than 20 days in August, and was agreed to by 100% of the hired poor peasants and new middle peasants. Most of the old middle peasants felt that they could earn money by producing independently because they had livestock, labor, funds, and technology. They were afraid of losing out if they cooperated in this way of large-scale mutual aid; but they also thought that if they did not help each other, they would not be able to do both household and outside work, and no one would take care of the family or run errands. Even if they had livestock and money, they would not be able to go out and earn money. After the masses of the whole village held several night meetings, they broke through these purely self-centered thoughts, and the masses immediately asked the cadres to quickly organize large-scale mutual aid.
After the method of large-scale mutual aid was mature, on September 20th of the lunar calendar, seven groups were formally formed: Zhangluo machine room (weaving sieve bottoms), carpentry, kiln workers, agriculture, textile, and transportation. The positive and negative group leaders of each group and the large group leader leading each group were elected by the people, and a preparatory committee of seven people was formed to solve all problems. This division of labor and cooperation can not only promote individual strengths, but also allow each group to be organically connected, cooperate with each other, and flexibly mobilize. For example, during the busy farming season, a certain industry can be reduced and people can be drawn to the land. During the slack farming season, people can be drawn to invest in the kiln worker group or the transportation group for production. In short, it is possible to flexibly expand or reduce a certain business according to the season and needs. The sieve machine room specializes in producing sieve bottoms for the Zhangluo group to use. The Zhangluo group goes out to work, focusing on exchanging flowers for grain, the flowers are supplied to the textile group, and the grain is kept for famine relief. The textile group does not worry about the lack of flowers to spin, and the spun yarn and woven cloth are handed over to the transportation team for sales. The carpentry group makes sieve rings for the Zhangluo group. The kiln worker group supplies the transportation group with charcoal to sell and supplies the masses to burn. The agricultural group guarantees that the village's agricultural seasonal production and support for the front line are not delayed. In terms of life, they stipulate that each person is calculated at one liter of millet per day. The kiln workers work hard and are calculated at two liters of rice per day. Each livestock is uniformly calculated at two liters of feed per day, but no rice is actually given. The accounts are settled together when the dividends are distributed. At the end of the year, when the accounts are settled and dividends are distributed, the work is evaluated according to the work done, the work points are calculated according to the points, and the dividends are distributed according to the work. The good ones are given more points, the bad ones are given fewer points, and special achievements are rewarded separately. The medicine money for people in each group who are sick is reimbursed by the large group, the large group buries the dead, and half of the livestock that die are compensated by everyone; daily legitimate expenses can be borrowed from the large group leader.
This method of labor-capital cooperation, village-wide mutual aid, and agricultural and sideline division of labor cooperation has been implemented since September 20th of the lunar calendar. The groups have been very enthusiastic, and they are all vying to do work, fearing that they will be evaluated with fewer points and will receive fewer dividends in the future. In the 20 days of experimentation, great achievements have been made. For example, when the agricultural group was plowing the autumn land, they plowed one mountain after another, and plowed one piece after another, without any delay. In 19 days, they finished plowing all the autumn land in the village, which was several days faster than other villages. The kiln workers completed a total of 105 workdays, and earned more than 14 stone of millet after deducting expenses. The machine room group also completed 61 workdays, earning 3 stone and 5 liters of rice, and also completed 40 agricultural workdays. The Zhangluo group was divided into two small groups, one to southern Shanxi and one to northern Yue, earning 2 stone and 4 dou of rice in 20 days. The transportation group also sold charcoal, totaling 320 workdays, earning 36,340 yuan in foreign currency. The carpentry group also earned a total of more than 5 stone of rice. Each group earned a total of more than 20 stone of rice. They plan to earn 100 stone of rice by the end of the year, in order to get through next year's spring famine.

　　组织起来解决困难
    ——柴洼庄实行劳资互助分工合作
    朱敦良
    据阳城五区一联村信用社的经理杨培基统计，该社从七月份到现在，贷给峪北、蒿村、申店、东山四行政村四百三十余户的百余万贷款中，富农两户，中农四百一十二户，贫农仅有十六户，而且贫农贷款的数量也少，这说明贷款没有贷到雇贫手里。他就亲自下乡与雇贫谈话，发现雇贫在生产中的困难很多，如没牲口，没资金，没技术，没人，互助没有出路，不敢贷款，怕赚不了钱还不起本。如柴洼庄贫农卫秋荣说：“我每次贷款最多两千元，咱不敢多要，怕还不了。”因此，杨经理感到单纯给雇贫贷款解决不了他们的生产困难，必须实行劳资互助分工合作，才能解决雇贫生产的困难，于是他就和柴洼庄干部研究，如何解决雇贫农的生产困难问题。经过几次研究和征求雇贫意见以后，大家便提出实行劳资结合全村大互助，就是把全村劳力、畜力、资金、用具及各种不同的技术工人，完全组织成一个大组，再根据各人的特长，分别组成各种类型的小组，统一由大组长领导，一切困难由大组（即全村）群众解决。各小组赚下钱交给大组长，做了活，给大组长报工，到年底即按活评工，按工分红。这一办法，在八月份经全村群众二十多天的酝酿，得到百分之百的雇贫农及新中农的同意，大部旧中农觉得自己有牲口、有劳力、有资金、又有技术，单独生产也能赚钱，这样合作大互助，怕自己吃亏；但他们又想到如果不互助起来，做了家的做不了外，家里没人照顾、没人支差，虽有牲口有钱，自己出不去，也是赚不了钱。经过全村群众开了几夜会议后，才打通了这些单纯各顾各的思想，群众马上就要求干部赶快组织大互助。
    大互助的办法酝酿成熟后，于阴历九月二十日正式组成张箩机房（织箩底）、木匠、窑工、农业、纺织、运输等七个组，民选出各组的正副组长及领导各组的大组长，又以七人组成一个筹备委员会，解决一切问题，这样分工合作，既能发扬个人特长，各组又能有机的互相联系、互相配合，灵活调动。如农忙时即缩小某种工业，抽人上地，农闲时，又可抽人投入窑工组或运输组生产。总之，是可以按季节、按需要灵活的扩大与缩小某一种业务。箩机房专出箩底，供张箩组使用，张箩组出外做活，着重换花换粮食，花供纺织组，粮食留着备荒。纺织组不愁没花纺，纺成的线织成的布，交运输队推销。木工组给张箩组做箩圈。窑工组供运输组卖炭和供给群众烧。农业组保证全村农业季节生产和支援前线两不误。在生活上，他们规定每人每天按一升小米计算，窑工活重，每人每天按二升米计算，牲口每头每天统按二升料计算，但都不出现米，等分红时一并结算，到年底算帐分红时按活评分，按分计工、按工分红，好的多评，差的少评，特别有成绩时另外奖励，各组人病了吃的药钱大组报销，死了人大组埋葬，牲口大家赶死了赔一半；日常的正当开支可向大组长借用。
    这种劳资合作全村大互助农副分工合作的办法，自阴历九月二十日开始实行后，各组的劲头很大，都是争着做活，光怕自己评的分少，将来分的红少。在二十天的实验中，获有很大成绩，如农业组在秋垡地时，垡完一山垡一山，犁了一块犁一块，一点也不背工。十九天的功夫，就把全村秋地垡完，比起别村要快好几天。窑工共做了一百零五个工，除花用外，还赚小米十四石多。机房组也做了六十一个工，赚米三石零五升，并做了农业工四十个。张箩组分成两个小组，一到晋南、一到岳北，二十天中赚了二石四斗米。运输组也捎带卖炭，合三百二十个工，赚洋三万六千三百四十元。木工组也合计赚米五石多。各组共赚米二十余石，他们计划到年底除开支外，要赚一百石米，以渡明年的春荒。
