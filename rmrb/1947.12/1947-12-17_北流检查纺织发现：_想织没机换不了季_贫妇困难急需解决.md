(Our Newspaper, Licheng News) The textile industry in Beiliu Village is a model for Licheng. From the village's average, they can not only weave for their own needs but also sell some homespun cloth. They have many weaving tools and their weaving skills are not low. However, a simple investigation from a class perspective recently revealed many problems. First, looking at the leadership composition, out of the eight textile team leaders in the village, two are rich peasants, four are middle peasants, and two are poor peasants. Out of the twenty-four group leaders, two are rich peasants, eleven are middle peasants, and eleven are poor peasants. The actual leadership power is mostly in the hands of middle and rich peasants. Second, looking at the textile tools, the upper-class households own many. For example, the eighty-one poor peasant households have only fourteen looms, while the eighty-six middle peasant households have twenty-nine looms. There are even two poor peasant households that don't even have spinning wheels. Self-sufficiency in weaving is not entirely for poor peasants, but also for landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants. The skills of the poor peasants are not as good as theirs. After investigation, a meeting of cadres above the group leader level was held, and the leadership was examined first. Women's Chairman Wang Xiaoping said: "Currently, two poor peasant families in our village, Liu Lin and Zhang Fuquan, have not even put on cotton clothes and are wearing patched clothes. It's not that they don't want to wear them, but they don't even have a spinning wheel or loom." Team leader Li Chunhua said: "We haven't got our priorities straight. In our group of ten people, there are three landlords, six middle peasants, and only one poor peasant. We even often praise the landlord Li Nianchong." Poor peasant Sanhu's mother said: "Being poor and unable to afford a machine is really worrying me to death. I looked for the team leader, and the team leader didn't care. I looked for the village chief, and the village chief didn't care. I borrowed from seven or eight families, and everyone is busy and won't lend it to me." Poor peasant Liu Chenghai's wife said: "The fourteen catties of yarn I have can't be turned into cloth. Everyone thinks I'm stingy. I'm afraid of losing out in mutual aid. I sold three dou of rice and exchanged it for three zhang of cloth, which barely got me through the season." Poor old woman Duan Mei, who is over sixty years old, said: "My group leader is still a rich peasant. Besides asking me for quotas, he hasn't held a meeting and hasn't changed the work assignment in a year." Zhang Xuelan said: "Every day, they say that poor peasants rule the world and poor peasants hold the knife handle, but our women's rescue committee member is still a rich peasant and doesn't lead us. We must replace her." Everyone raised criticisms to the leadership, pointing out that the leadership composition urgently needs to be reformed and that the tools and raw materials of the poor peasants must be thoroughly resolved. After deliberation, the poor peasants were democratically elected to lead, and two committee members and eight textile group leaders were reformed. The eleven fruit machines were immediately temporarily distributed to the poor peasant women. The cooperative also lent cotton to the poor peasant women, and the women also clarified that they would serve the poor peasants. It was proposed that spinning and weaving should prioritize the poor peasants to ensure that they would all have new clothes for next spring. Middle peasant Li Chunhua said: "I have enough cloth to wear myself, so I will lend it to the poor peasants to weave for a few days first." Poor old woman Wang Gai, who is over fifty years old, excitedly said: "Chairman Mao is really good to us poor people. After turning ourselves over, he helps us with textiles, and we will never be poor again. I must learn to weave this winter." Currently, Beiliu Textile is enthusiastically developing under the leadership of the poor peasants.

    (Our Newspaper, Lincheng News) In order to carry out the textile movement, the Third District held meetings of poor and hired peasant activists at key points to study the fact that the poor and hired peasants' emancipation was not thorough, and some of them were not as well off as others after emancipation. Poor and hired peasants wanted to weave but had no tools, and there were many difficulties. It was decided that the cooperative would provide loans to help poor and hired peasants buy some tools, and they would only repay the money after they had earned it. Old tools would be repaired, and tools from feudal hands would be lent to poor and hired peasants. The cooperative would also buy cotton to help solve the raw material difficulties. Also, because the weaving skills of the poor women are not high, the cooperative can take back the coarse yarn and weave cloth bags to help the poor women learn, so that they do not lose money.

    北流检查纺织发现：
    想织没机换不了季
    贫妇困难急需解决
    【本报黎城讯】北流村的纺织，是黎城的模范。从全村平均来看，自织自给还能出售一部土布，纺织工具也不少，纺织技术也不低。但近来从阶级观点出发做了个简单调查，就发现了不少问题。首先从领导成份上看，全村八个纺织大队长中，富农二名、中农四名、贫农二名，二十四个组长中，富农二名、中农十一名、贫农十一名，实际领导权大部为中富农掌握。再从纺织工具上看，上层户占的很多。如贫农八十一户，有织机十四个，中农八十六户，即有织机二十九个，还有两户贫农，连纺车都没有。自织自足还不全是贫雇，而是地主、富农、中农。贫雇的技术，更比不上他们高。经过调查，召开了组长以上干部会议，首先检查领导。妇女主席王小平说：“现在咱村刘淋、张富全两家贫农，连棉衣还未套上，穿着千针万纳的破衣服，不是她不舍穿，是她连纺车织机都没有。”大队长李春花说：“咱的屁股没坐正，全组十个人，三个地主、六个中农、才一个贫农呀，还经常表扬地主李辇虫好。”贫农三虎妈说：“家贫做不起机，真是愁死啦，找队长队长不管，找村长村长不管，借了七八家，家家都不闲，也借不上。”贫农刘成海老婆说：“我家存十四斤线变不成布，大家嫌我尖，变工怕吃亏，卖了三大斗米，换了三丈布，才算换了季。”六十多岁的贫老婆段梅说：“我组长还是个富农，除了和我要数目，没有开过会，一年不变一次工。”张雪兰说：“整天说是贫雇坐天下，贫雇掌刀把，咱妇救常委还是富农，也不领导咱，可得换换她哩。”大家都向领导上提出了批评意见。提出领导成份急需改造，贫雇农的工具、原料必须彻底解决。经酝酿民主选出贫雇来领导，改造了常委两人，和八个纺织组长。将十一架果实机，马上暂时分给贫雇妇女，合作社将棉花也贷给贫雇妇女，妇女们也明确了为贫雇服务。提出纺花织布先尽贫雇，保证明年春天都换上新衣服。中农李春花说：“自己布已够穿，先借给贫雇织上几天。”五十多岁的贫老婆王改兴奋的说：“毛主席对咱穷人真正好，翻了身再帮助纺织，永远穷不了，我今年冬总要学会织布。”现北流纺织在贫雇领导下，正热烈开展。

    【本报临城讯】三区为开展纺织运动，分基点召开贫雇积极分子会议，研究出贫雇翻身不彻底，有的翻身了光景也比不上人家，贫雇想纺织没工具，困难很多，研究决定：合作社贷款帮助贫雇买些工具，＠下了钱才还。修旧工具，把封建手中工具，借给贫雇使用。合作社还要给买花，帮助解决原料困难。又因贫妇纺织技术不高，合作社可把粗线收回织布袋，帮助贫雇学会，不要叫他们赔钱。    （三区通讯员、保荣、贵善、培惠、森林、景田、全贵、景武）
