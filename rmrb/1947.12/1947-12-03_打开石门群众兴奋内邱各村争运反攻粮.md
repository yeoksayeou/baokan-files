　　[Neiqiu News from Our Newspaper] After the grain transportation task was assigned to Zhangduo Village, in the second district of Neiqiu, the peasants who had been liberated unanimously said: "The young and strong fight against Chiang Kai-shek at the front, and we support them in the rear. This is our task." Everyone mobilized, using both animals and vehicles. They immediately organized all seventy-three full and half laborers, sixty livestock, and thirty carts in the village into six teams and two squads, forming a small unit. They elected a squad leader and three administrative staff to manage accommodation, cooking, and feeding the livestock. The landlords were appropriately assigned to each team under mass supervision to prevent sabotage. To prevent illness among people and animals on the road, Zhang Shengtang, a liberated doctor, volunteered to accompany the transportation team to serve the masses and ensure the smooth completion of the counter-offensive grain transportation task. The liberated masses of Xianren Village in the third district, hearing about the capture of Shimen and the capture of more than twenty county's worth of fugitive landlords, were excited and eager to go when they heard about transporting grain to the north this time. After the organization was completed on the night of the 24th, the logistics committee announced the names of the cattle and laborers. Wang Sanbao, Fan Qiuzi, Li Zaohuo, and others, hearing that their cattle were not mentioned (because they were too small), said before the announcement was finished: "Why aren't our cattle on the list?" The branch secretary said: "Your cattle are too small and can't handle it. They need to stay at home to cultivate the land for the military families." When the list of porters was read, Wang Renhe, Fan Haiquan, and other twelve young people said: "Why aren't our names on the list?" Others said: "You are too small." They replied in unison: "We can carry less if we are small. Anyway, we want to go." They have now organized eighty full and half laborers and twenty-eight carts to transport grain. In Meng Village, the second district, old military family member @ Qiyuan, who is over fifty years old this year, was not called to join the counter-offensive army, and he was very dissatisfied. He was not included in the grain transportation plan either, so he volunteered, saying: "I wasn't called to join the army the other day. This time, it's my turn to transport the counter-offensive grain. I don't have livestock, but I can carry it on my shoulders. Don't think I'm old; I'm still strong, and I can carry as much as the young people." Under his influence, the entire village organized a carrying team in addition to the carts. In Qian Xiahou Village, the sixth district, poor peasant Xu Xiaoshou took out all three cloth bags from his home. Fearing that it wouldn't be enough, he sewed one out of a bed sheet. He said, "This counter-offensive grain is for our own people. We have nineteen new and old soldiers in our village; who doesn't eat grain? My brother is also at the front." Xu Shateng said: "I don't have livestock, so I'll push a cart with two hundred pounds. It's no problem without someone pulling it. The Communist Party has led me to liberation. I have food and clothing now, and I have energy this year." Under their lead, the entire village, including people, livestock, carts, and small vehicles, were all mobilized to transport grain. (Zhi'an, Zhenshan)
　　
　　[Shahe News from Our Newspaper] The masses in the villages of the sixth district are rushing to water the wheat during the day, and discussing the transportation of counter-offensive grain at night. In particular, the poor and hired peasants are especially eager to transport grain. For example, Lu Tianqing of Nanwang Village said: "I wasn't called to fight in Shimen. This time, I'm going to transport public grain." Women such as Yang Qin, Lü Zhuang, and Dang Lan voluntarily proposed to transport counter-offensive grain. Zhu De Niu of Xi Cui said: "Now that I have been liberated, my children and wife are happy. I am too old to join the war, but I can still push a cart. I can push a hundred pounds." Xian Zhi Niang said: "The Communist Party has led us to liberation, and now we have food and drink. My children are too young to join the army, but this time I want to carry half a load of grain." The enthusiasm of the masses for transporting counter-offensive grain is particularly high. For example, the entire district collectively transported ××× ten thousand catties, and each village exceeded ×× ten thousand catties after taking the lead. (Gao Meng, Zhengmin)
