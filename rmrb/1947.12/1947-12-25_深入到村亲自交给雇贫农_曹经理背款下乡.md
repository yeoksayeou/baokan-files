　　Going Deep into Villages to Personally Deliver Funds to Hired and Poor Peasants
  　Manager Cao Carries Funds to the Countryside

　　[Our newspaper, Pingshun News] The Fifth District Credit Bank has been established for almost five months. Looking back on these five months of operation, we realize that our perspective of truly serving the hired and poor is still not sufficient. After research, we have decided to resolutely serve the hired and poor farmers, and decided to use the existing 400 jin of cotton, plus another 500,000 yuan, to personally go to the countryside to understand their specific difficulties and provide appropriate solutions in conjunction with the village. Manager Yan Qing, on the 12th of this month, took the funds and first went to Hebei Village, a relatively poor village, to work. After first discussing with the village cadres, he convened a meeting of hired and poor peasants, starting with clothing and food, and then discussing production. For example, the 70-year-old poor widowed man Wang Renyi and the old woman Zhang, both did not have enough grain to eat for the whole year. As for production, they could not do it themselves, and they did not have money to buy shares. After understanding this situation, he and the village cadres thought of a solution for them. In addition, there were three hired and poor farmers with labor, who also wanted to produce but lacked capital. At this time, the bank lent each of the five people 20,000 yuan, for a term of three months, to help them cooperate in production. These three people with labor, led by Deputy Village Chief Jiao Youcai, acknowledged that the two elderly people were only responsible for earning and not for compensating for losses. The old people happily said: "Our difficulties are overcome by relying on the government and you three, and when we earn money, we will first buy some fuel." All five of them were very happy. In Gao'anshang, after discussing with the cadres and the masses, it was found that eight hired and poor peasant households did not have capital for production and needed loan assistance, including four military families and two widowed households, to whom a total of 100,000 yuan was lent. They invested part of it in the village's hemp rope shop and part of it in the production team for transportation. Their transportation plan was to buy pepper from the third and fourth districts, sell it in Hongdong, and buy back cotton, salt, and tobacco leaves to sell locally. He also led these eight hired and poor peasant households to elect a representative to keep abreast of their production situation, and also lent eight jin of cotton to a military family and a widowed family among these eight households, priced at 800 yuan per jin, which was lower than the market price, to solve their raw material difficulties for textile production. The masses reflected: "Our government really cares about the people! Bringing the money to our homes to help us overcome difficulties! We must produce well!" After research, the method of carrying funds to the countryside has the following seven benefits: 1. It can truly find the hired and poor peasants and solve their specific difficulties. 2. It can check past old loans. 3. It can develop and organize credit cooperatives, or generally help cooperatives establish credit business. 4. The relationship between the credit bank and the masses can be closer. 5. It can prevent bad people from speculating on loans. 6. It can save people's strength. 7. It can train oneself by going to the countryside and going deep among the masses. Now the bank is moving forward in this direction. (Hong Zhang, Fu Hai)

　　深入到村亲自交给雇贫农
  　曹经理背款下乡
    【本报平顺讯】五区信用银号自成立到现在，已经快五个月了，在这五个月的营业中，检讨起来，真正为雇贫服务的观点还不很够。经研究，今后应坚决为雇贫农民服务，决定将现有四百斤棉花，再准备上五十万元款，亲自下乡深入雇贫，了解其具体困难，结合村上给以适当解决。曹经理延庆同志，于本月十二日，带着款先到比较穷苦一些的村子河北村去工作。首先和村干部研究后，即召开雇贫农会议闲圪拉，先从穿衣吃饭谈起，再谈到生产上。如六七十岁的贫农鳏寡王仁义老汉与张老太太，都是粮食不够一年吃，生产吧，自己也干不了，入上些股吧，也没有钱。他了解了这个情况后，和村干部就给他想办法。另外，还有三个有劳力的雇贫农民，他们也是想生产没有本钱。这时，银号便给他们五个人每人贷了二万元款，期限三个月，让他们互助起来生产。这三个有劳力的人，以副村长焦有才为主，并承认两个老人是管赚不管赔，老人家高兴的说：“我们二人的困难就是依靠政府和你三人给克服哩，赚上钱先买上点烧的。”他们五人都很高兴。到高岸上，和干部与群众研究，有八户雇贫农民生产没有本钱，需要贷款帮助解决，其中有四户军属，二户鳏寡，共给贷了十万元，他们入到村里的麻绳铺一部分，入到生产队里一部分搞运输。他们的运输，计划从三、四区买上花椒，到洪洞卖了买回棉花、食盐、烟叶来到本地卖。他并领导这八户雇贫选举了一个代表，让他经常了解他们生产情况，并又贷给这八户中一个军属一个鳏寡八斤棉花，价钱每斤以八百元算，比市价低，解决他们纺织原料困难。群众反映：“咱们的政府真是关心老百姓呀！拿上款找到咱家里来给咱克服困难哩！咱们可得好好生产哩！”背款下乡这个办法，经研究，有以下七个好处：一、能真正找到了雇贫农民，给他们解决具体困难。二、能检查过去的旧贷款。三、能发展组织信用社，或普遍帮助合作社建立信用业务。四、信用银号与群众的关系能更加密切起来。五、能防止坏人投机贷款。六、能节省民力。七、在下乡深入群众中能锻炼自己。现在该银号正朝着这个方向前进。　　　（宏璋、富海）
