After seventeen months of self-defense warfare and the annihilation of a large number of enemies, our region's strategic situation has obviously achieved an advantage. The characteristics of this situation are manifested in: (1) Since our main forces launched a southern expedition in August of this year, from the perspective of the overall national situation, our army has shifted from internal operations to annihilating a large number of enemies in external operations. Our region's task, in addition to fully supporting the southern front, is to actively eliminate the remaining enemies in the interior and consolidate and expand the liberated areas. Over the past few months, we have made great achievements in carrying out this task, recovering more than twenty cities, removing isolated strongholds such as Yongnian and Yuanshi, and liberating vast areas south of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, completely compressing the enemy into edge points and lines. Although the Chiang army still maintains nearly 200,000 troops north of the Longhai Railway against us, most of them have suffered annihilation and annihilation-type blows from us. If we look at their morale, political quality, and relationship with the masses, they are fundamentally incomparable to us. The enemy has fallen into a purely defensive posture. We are in an unprecedentedly advantageous situation, controlling 127 county towns north of the Longhai Railway, completely connected into one piece, with a population of 30 million, and land reform has been carried out. These conditions did not exist in any previous period. (2) Due to our army's counter-offensive, a new high tide of revolution has emerged, and the Chiang army's crisis has deepened. Therefore, the enemy is increasingly carrying out frantic and desperate acts of sabotage, such as the recent concentration of troops to carry out focused and planned harassment and looting of the border areas, as well as surprise attacks, air raids, and combined attacks on our rear organs and towns, conscription, grain robbery and arson, and especially strengthening their special agent instigation, bandit activities, and organization of secret societies, actively undermining our post-counter-offensive human resources and social order. These struggling measures of the enemy reflect the internal fear and wavering of the enemy; the closer it gets to death, the more it struggles, trying to change the mode of struggle (such as adopting covert struggles, air raids, special agents, superstitious methods), taking advantage of the people's unpreparedness to give us unexpected blows. This is the dying struggle of the reactionary class. If we are not vigilant against these actions of the enemy and give them the necessary response, we will suffer losses.

It is absolutely necessary to correctly understand the changes in the enemy and our situation. If we cannot see these changes clearly, we will make mistakes in our work. In recent months, in some areas and among some comrades, right-leaning wavering ideas have arisen because they have turned a blind eye to these changes, and this has become the main danger in our current internal struggle. This right-leaning thinking initially manifests itself as peaceful complacency, believing that since the full-scale counter-offensive has begun and the main force has victoriously fought on the outer line, there is nothing to worry about. It is characterized by underestimating the enemy, being satisfied with the status quo, paralyzing oneself, relaxing the struggle, ignoring guerrilla warfare, and ignoring the task of creating and training new main force corps, so that they cannot complete the task and suffer some unnecessary losses. After suffering losses, they quickly turn to fear and retreat from the struggle.

As mentioned above, this kind of thinking is due to the lack of correct analysis of the enemy and our situation, the lack of active and proactive organization of the struggle against the enemy, and the overestimation of the enemy's strength and underestimation of our own strength in the struggle. It does not understand that the enemy is weak and has low morale after being severely attacked by us. A large number of enemies have been attracted south by our main force and are trapped in a dilemma. The enemy's frenzy is only a dying struggle and a show of strength, but as long as we resolutely struggle, we will be able to defeat the enemy. But we must resolutely struggle to eliminate the enemy. The enemy will not die on its own.

To this end, we must thoroughly eliminate complacency, a desire for ease and comfort, the failure to see or ignore the danger of the enemy's dying offensive, as well as right-leaning emotions such as overestimating the enemy, underestimating the strength of the people, fearing the enemy, retreating and fleeing. We must strictly enforce discipline, resolutely struggle, carry forward a vigorous fighting spirit, independently and proactively attack the enemy, find the enemy's weaknesses, defeat the enemy one by one, and eliminate the enemy's living strength. We must appropriately concentrate our forces, organize campaigns and battles with emphasis, organization, and planning, and annihilate and eliminate the enemy's remaining strongholds one by one. The struggle of guerrillas and backbone corps must be closely combined to continue to develop guerrilla warfare in the border areas, resolutely implement the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance," and universally carry out the struggle against "mopping-up operations," "nibbling," "grain robbery," "conscription," and "bandit suppression," so as to continuously eliminate the enemy's claws, reduce the enemy's scope of activity, and trap the enemy in isolated strongholds before annihilating them at an opportune moment. In carrying out the above struggles, we must combine war with land reform, and the army must unconditionally participate in and support the land reform movement. This is the most fundamental thing. We must mobilize the masses, abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, help the masses to stand up and emancipate themselves, and truly rely on the basic masses, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants and rural workers to carry out the struggle. We must resolutely and proactively give the enemy a strong blow militarily, strive to annihilate part or most of the enemy in each battle, and accumulate small victories into big victories. We must oppose the idea that we cannot fight big battles and small battles are not worth fighting. We must oppose the tactical guidance of dividing our forces and passively taking a beating. We must vigorously build our military region's field corps, accumulate strategic reserve forces, and create new corps in order to maneuver and annihilate the enemy. The method is to let the existing corps go into battle to train, cultivate, and improve their ability to attack strongholds and conduct continuous operations, and seize the gaps in combat to train, and implement teaching war through war. Only in this way can we quickly improve their combat effectiveness and make them invincible. Correctly recognizing that the situation is favorable to us, actively and proactively attacking the enemy, and building and cultivating the main force corps are the three basic links for us to win future struggles.

In the recent period, some areas have taken a positive struggle approach by initially fighting against right-leaning emotions, such as adopting "the enemy advances, we advance," organizing campaigns and battles, advancing to the enemy's rear to conduct guerrilla warfare, attacking the enemy who go out to rob grain, and combining political offensives to shake and disintegrate the enemy. Organizing joint defense and self-defense, holding explosions and sabotage, making the enemy hit a wall everywhere. In particular, seizing all the gaps and maneuvering bravely to advance to the enemy's rear, so that the enemy's plan is in chaos and passive. These constant large and small victories all show that as long as we resolutely struggle, we will surely be victorious, the morale of the masses will become higher and higher, and more and more methods of struggle will be created by the masses.

### 认清形势开展对敌斗争

    认清形势开展对敌斗争
    经过十七个月的自卫战争，歼灭大量敌人后，我区战略形势已显然取得优势，这一形势的特点表现在：（一）自今年八月我各解放军主力南征后，从全国局面说，我军已由内线作战转为外线大量歼敌；而我区任务则除全力支援南线外，主动在内线肃清残敌、巩固与扩大解放区。数月来，我们在执行这一任务上已有很大成绩，收复了二十余座城市，拔除了永年、元氏等孤立据点，解放了冀鲁豫黄河以南广大地区，将敌完全压缩于边沿点线内。蒋军虽在陇海线以北对我仍保持将近二十万兵力，但大部是受过我歼灭与歼灭性打击的，若从其士气、政治质量及群众关系等条件上看，则根本不能与我比拟，敌已陷于单纯防御态势。我们是处于空前有利形势，在陇海路北已控制有一百二十七座县城，完全结成一片，拥有三千万人口，且已进行过土地改革，这种条件在过去任何时期是没有的。（二）由于我军反攻，新的革命新高潮已经出现，蒋军危机更加深刻化，因此，敌人就愈益进行疯狂的绝望性的破坏活动，如最近敌人集中兵力实行有重点的有计划的对边沿区的骚扰抢劫，以及对我后方机关及城镇的奔袭，空袭与合击，抓丁、抢粮焚粮，特别加强其特务策动、土匪活动、组织会门，积极破坏我反攻后方的人力资源与社会秩序等。敌人这类挣扎性举措，反映敌人内部的恐惧和动摇；它愈接近死亡就愈加挣扎，企图改换斗争方式（如采取荫蔽斗争、空袭、特务、迷信等手段），趁人民冷不防备给我们以意外的打击，这是反动阶级垂死的挣扎，倘不警惕敌人这些行动而予以必要的回击，我们是会吃亏的。
    正确认识敌我形势的变化，是完全必要的。看不清这些变化，在工作中就会犯错误。数月以来，在若干地区与若干同志中就是由于对这种变化熟视无睹而产生了右倾动摇思想，并成为我们当前内线斗争中的主要危险。这种右倾思想开始表现为和平苟安，认为全面反攻既已开始，主力已胜利打到外线，即可太平无事，轻视敌人，满足现状，麻痹自己，松懈斗争，忽视游击战争，忽视创造锻炼新的主力兵团的任务，以致不能完成任务，并遭受某些不应有的损失；在遭受损失后迅即转而产生对斗争的畏惧与退缩等。
    如上所述，这种思想是由于对敌我形势没有作正确分析，没有积极主动的组织对敌斗争，以及在斗争时又过高估计敌人的力量，过低估计自己力量，不了解敌人是软弱的，是经我严重打击后斗志低下的，大量敌人已被我主力吸引南去，陷于进退维谷之境，敌人的疯狂，只不过是回光返照和外强中干的挣扎而已，只要我坚决斗争，必能击败敌人；但必须坚决斗争，才能消灭敌人，敌人是不会自己死亡的。
    为此，必须彻底肃清松懈麻痹、苟且偷安、看不见或忽视敌人垂死进攻的危险性，以及过高估计敌人、过低估计人民力量、畏惧敌人、退却逃跑等右倾情绪，必须严整纪律，坚决斗争，发扬旺盛的战斗精神，独立自主的积极主动的进攻敌人，寻找敌人弱点，各个击破敌人，消灭敌人有生力量；必须适当集结兵力，有重点，有组织，有计划的组织战役战斗，各个歼灭拔除敌人的残留据点；游击队与基干兵团的斗争密切结合，继续发展边沿区游击战争，坚决实行敌进我进，普遍开展反扫荡、反蚕食、反抢粮、反抓丁、剿灭土匪的斗争，达到不断消灭敌人爪牙，缩小敌人活动范围，逼困敌人于孤立据点内而后相机消灭之。在进行上述斗争中，必须做到战争与土改相结合，军队无条件参加与支持土地改革运动。这是最基本的，必须发动群众，遵守三大纪律八项注意，帮助群众自己起来翻身，做到真正依靠基本群众，依靠贫雇农乡村工人进行斗争。必须在军事上坚决主动给敌以有力的打击，力求在每次战斗中歼敌一部或大部，以小胜集为大胜，反对大仗打不了小仗又不值得打的思想；反对分兵把口，被动挨打的战术指导，必须以大力建设我们的军区野战兵团，积蓄战略后备力量，创造新的兵团，以便机动歼敌，其办法便是将现有兵团放手到战斗中去锻炼，培养与提高其攻坚与连续作战的能力，并抓紧在战斗空隙中训练，实行以战教战。只有如此，才能迅速提高其战斗力，作到无攻不克无坚不摧。正确认识形势对我有利，积极主动的进攻敌人，与建设培养主力兵团，三者即是我们取得今后斗争胜利的基本环节。
    最近一个时期，若干地区由于初步向右倾情绪作了斗争，采取了积极斗争的方针，诸如采取敌进我进，组织战役战斗，向敌挺进游击，打击外出抢粮之敌，结合政治攻势动摇与瓦解敌人；组织联防自卫，举行爆炸破击，使敌到处碰的焦头烂额；特别是抓紧一切空隙机动勇敢的向敌后挺进，使敌计划陷于混乱被动等。这些不断的大小胜利，都在说明：只要我们坚决斗争，就一定能够胜利，群众的斗志也会越斗越高，斗争的办法也会被群众更多的创造出来。
