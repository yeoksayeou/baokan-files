Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: The military and civilians in various parts of the coastal area are tensely engaged in the anti-plundering struggle and have achieved initial victories. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Linyi, Xinhai, Shijiusuo and other places are besieged and attacked by our forces, fragmented and lacking food. Most of the puppet bandits do not have cotton-padded clothes and are venturing out to plunder. On the 29th of last month, a part of the 83rd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Linyi and the 44th Brigade of the same division stationed in Yishui, totaling about 3,000 men, and the puppet bandit Wang Hongjiu's troops crossed the Shu River eastward to raid Zhubian, Xinglongdian, Shizilu, Liangdian and other places. A part of the 83rd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Shijiusuo also coordinated to invade the west. The two regiments of the 44th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Binan and the remnants of the puppet bandit Yang Buren also simultaneously invaded the north. After our military and civilians fought bravely to repel the above-mentioned bandits and puppets, they were wounded and fled back to their original locations in disgrace. The characteristics of this Chiang Kai-shek bandit operation are: (1) They are timid as mice, attacking every day at 8 am, advancing on several routes at the same time, traveling less than 20 li a day, and retreating after advancing, attacking again the next day. (2) They are insidious, each time they invade, the advance troops bring a large number of disguised refugees, vendors, militiamen, etc., in an attempt to confuse us, and use the families of the landlords' "homecoming corps" to scout out our military situation and the location of materials. (3) They burn, kill and plunder. The landlords' homecoming corps following Chiang Kai-shek's bandits do everything evil in the villages they reach. For example, more than 180 of the 200 households in Da＠ Village were burned, and the fire along both sides of the Lin-Tao Road soared into the sky. (4) They spread rumors of their movements in advance, causing our cadres and masses to be nervous for a time, but they do not move immediately, and launch a surprise attack when our vigilance is relaxed. For example, in Diantou and Bali Lane villages in Linshu (Xinxian) County, due to a sense of peace, 109 cattle and donkeys were lost, 77,000 jin of grain, and all furniture was smashed. All of the more than 700 villagers were driven to the Chiang-occupied areas, except for those who were killed. In this anti-plundering struggle, most of the masses in our areas first emptied their houses and cleared the fields, and buried public grain. The militia and local armed forces also launched a mine warfare, cooperating with the Binhai People's Liberation Army in combat. In the Linshu area, a joint defense organization of "when one place is attacked, all villages will provide reinforcements" has been established. The current democratic government is providing relief to the affected compatriots, dispatching doctors to treat the sick, and calling on farmers in various places to help the victims solve their food, clothing and housing difficulties.

    临沂等地蒋匪被困缺衣缺食
    出扰抢掠均被击退
    【新华社华东十五日电】滨海各地军民紧张进入反抢掠斗争，并获初步胜利。临沂、新海、石臼所等地蒋匪被我困击，支离破碎，粮食奇缺，大部分伪匪没有棉衣，出扰抢掠。上月二十九日，临沂蒋匪八三师一部及调集该师驻沂水之四四旅约共三千余人，和伪匪王洪九部东渡沭河进扰洙边、兴隆店、十字路、良店等地，石臼所蒋匪八三师一部亦配合西犯。滨南蒋匪四四师两个团兵力及伪匪杨步仁残部亦同时北犯。上述各路匪伪经我军民奋勇反击，予以杀伤后，均狼狈窜回原地。此次蒋匪出动特点为：（一）胆小如鼠，每天晨八时出犯，数路齐头并进，日行不足二十里，进后即退，次日再犯。（二）用心阴险，每次进犯时先头部队带大批伪装难民、商贩、民兵等，以图迷惑，并利用地主“还乡团”家属刺探我军情及物资所在地。（三）烧杀抢掠，尾随蒋匪之地主还乡团所到各庄，无所不为。如大＠村二百余户被烧达一百八十余户，沿临涛路两侧火光冲天。（四）事前散布出动谣言，使我干部群众精神一度紧张，但不立即出动，待我警戒松懈时即突然袭击。如临沭（新县）店头、八里巷两村，因太平观念，损失牛驴一百零九头，粮食七万七千斤，家具悉被砸毁，村民除被杀外，七百余户全数被驱往蒋占区去。此次反抢掠斗争中，我各地群众大部先空室清野，掩埋公粮。民兵地武亦展开地雷战，配合滨海解放军作战。临沭某区一带且成立“一处打响，庄庄增援”之联防组织。现民主政府救济被难同胞，派遣医生救治病人，并号召各地农民帮助被害群众解决衣食住困难。
