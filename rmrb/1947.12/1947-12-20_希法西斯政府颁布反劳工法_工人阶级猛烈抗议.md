    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th -- Athens Dispatch: The new anti-labor law, which severely prohibits strikes and was promulgated by the Greek fascist government on the 8th, has been met with fierce protests from the Greek working class. Trade union leader Raft criticized this, saying: "The promulgation of the new anti-labor law further illustrates that the government has torn off all masks and is doing its utmost to protect the reactionary thirty-five families, while depriving workers of the right to fight for bread. This law is also the most important link in a series of terror and fascist measures launched by the government against workers. However, no law can force Greek workers to become a group of docile slaves." The General Secretary of the Greek Trade Union, the socialist Stratis, denounced it, saying: "The new law completes the legislation of anti-labor measures implemented by the Greek government since March 1946." The Electrical Engineers Alliance, the Government Employees Federation, the Pan-Hellenic Federation of Postal and Telecommunications Employees, and many other labor groups have successively passed resolutions expressing their opposition. According to TASS, even some members of parliament pointed out when the fascist government's reactionary measure was passed: "The new law is far from strengthening the government's position; on the contrary, it will weaken it and even accelerate the government's downfall."

    希法西斯政府颁布反劳工法
    工人阶级猛烈抗议
    【新华社陕北十八日电】雅典讯：希腊法西斯政府八日所颁布的严禁罢工的新反劳工法，已遭到希工人阶级的猛烈抗议。职工会领袖赖夫对此抨击称：“新反劳工法的颁布，更加说明政府已撕毁一切假面具，竭力保护反动的三十五个家族，而剥夺工人为争取面包而斗争之权利。该法律也是政府对工人所发动的一连串恐怖与法西斯措施中最重要的环节。然而没有任何法律能迫使希腊工人变为一群驯服的奴隶。”希职工会总书记社会党人斯特拉迪斯斥责说：“新法律完成了希腊政府自一九四六年三月以来所执行的反劳工措施的立法。”电机工程师联盟、政府雇员联合会、全希邮电雇员联盟及其他许多劳工团体，纷纷决议表示反对。据塔斯社讯：法西斯政府这一反动措施，就连若干议员在该议案通过之时也指出：“新法律远不能加强政府的地位，相反地还会削弱它，甚至加速政府的垮台。”
