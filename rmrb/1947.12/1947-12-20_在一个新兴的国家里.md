    In a Newly Emerging Country
    Liu Ningyi
    Since arriving in Yugoslavia, I have been traveling day and night, visiting Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Slovenia, and the Adriatic coast. Yugoslavia is made up of six republics. After four years of guerrilla warfare, over a million people were killed or massacred during the German and Italian occupation. Out of their national population of thirteen million, an average of one out of every eleven people was sacrificed. The entire country, under the leadership of Tito, carried out a long period of resistance. At that time, Mihailović and his die-hard Chetniks also raised the banner of anti-German resistance, but they consistently colluded with the Germans, using extremely cruel means to slaughter the guerrillas. After killing people, they would drink and revel with the Germans. Later, they openly cooperated with the Germans, maintaining order and acting as informants for them. After the victory, the Yugoslav people arrested Mihailović, publicly tried him, exposed his crimes, and sentenced him to death, which greatly satisfied the people. Last October, the country implemented the confiscation of traitor property, all of which was nationalized. In this way, not only were the lands of the large landlords distributed to the peasants, but the traitorous big capitalists were also thoroughly liquidated. The national economy is currently undergoing construction in three forms: public, private, and cooperative. Land is being used for large-scale cooperative production, mainly divided into three types: state-owned farms, collective farms, and individual farms.

    We visited two of the largest steel plants, each with 5,000 workers; a coal mine with 1,500 workers; a yarn factory with 3,000 workers; a knitting factory with 400 workers; a winery with 500 workers; and a collective farm with 3,000 farmers. Construction is underway everywhere in the country, and the lives of the workers have greatly improved. For example, although prices are twice as high as before the war, wages have increased tenfold. Trade unions are well-established everywhere. The buildings formerly occupied by capitalists, compradors, and secret agents have become the sites of trade unions. Although Yugoslavia is small, the trade union buildings are in five- to seven-story buildings. Every worker has a one-month vacation opportunity each year. The sanatoriums are built in large forests, planted with exotic flowers and rare herbs, with small springs and streams flowing through the gardens. Birds sing freely, and people play happily. Some young men and women pitch tents and live in campsites in meadows and foothills. Every evening, bonfires are lit, and men and women hold hands, sing free songs, and dance excitedly. Those who are not in good health stay in the sanatorium rooms, with doctors to treat them. When we visited, the girls all leaned their heads out of the windows and waved to us. When we entered their rooms, we saw them sleeping quietly in snow-white beds, covered with light green blankets. One of the female workers held a copy of a workers' magazine and smiled warmly, "Comrade! I am reading your talk about the lives of workers in the Chinese Liberated Areas, and how your workers have fulfilled their responsibility to defend the nation!" They smiled and affectionately admired the heroic sons and daughters of China.

    The Yugoslav youth are enthusiastically devoting themselves to the construction of their motherland, forgetting their families and rushing to the labor front. They have organized railway teams, construction teams... We saw a youth team building a railway. This was only a part of it, more than 8,000 people. It was a mountain forest through which a large river flowed. The mountains were cliffs, the trees were thorny, and the water was roaring. The young people came from the South, the North, the East, the West, England, Romania, Greece, Belgium, Norway, Hungary, Bulgaria... men and women, workers, farmers, students... Flags were erected high on the mountain tops, on the bridgeheads, and at the tunnel entrances. That day was a sports meeting. Thousands of young people gathered at the foot of the mountain by the river. Some climbed trees, some sat on rocks, holding hoes and mattocks. Airplanes flew proudly overhead, scattering large numbers of leaflets and pictures. When we arrived at the meeting place, after a round of applause, we only heard "Long live the Chinese Liberated Areas! Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" The crowd lifted us up, and bunches of flowers were thrown on our heads. I was excited and shed tears of excitement! Cannon fire rang out, and songs rose up. I thanked them simply:

    "Under the leadership of General Tito, you defeated fascism, and you are doing the work of moving mountains and overturning seas for the happiness of the people. The patriotic sons and daughters of China, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against American imperialism and the Chinese Mihailović, Chiang Kai-shek! We want to build the whole world into a happy, permanently peaceful, and pleasantly constructive family!"

    They opened amazing caves, split hundred-zhang-high mountains, and have already built four hundred miles of railway. If it were the old rulers, this project would have required six years of planning and twelve years of construction. But the modern youth completed it in three months of struggle. The people celebrated it, the imperialists were amazed by it, and the mountains and rivers changed color!

    There are no hotels for travelers here. In the evening, a female comrade took me to a family's house. She gently knocked on the door, and a middle-aged man welcomed me in. The female comrade said "Good night" and left. The man pointed with his hand, and then pointed again. I understood that one side was the bedroom, and the other was the toilet. He shook hands with me, gave a salute, and we separated. The house was very chic, with oil paintings hanging on the walls and well-furnished. I was very embarrassed to step on the carpet with my muddy feet. This is the home of a local worker. The next morning, there was a gentle knock on the door. I had already washed up. A young woman brought tea and snacks. After I had finished, she and her sister (this is what I guessed) led me to another room and took out brushes and shoe polish, wanting to shine my shoes for me. I quickly snatched them away and polished them myself. They smiled naturally, watched me, picked up a linen cloth, and helped me. Later, I understood that here, like in our Liberated Areas, a style had been developed in the anti-fascist war. As long as you were an anti-fascist fighter or comrade, no matter where you were, no matter who you were with, everywhere was like family, everywhere was home. We didn't understand a word of each other's languages, but we understood everything. When I left, they sent me to the door. My car drove away, far, far away, and they were still waving.

    On the mountains of Belgrade, surrounded by greenery, a beautiful villa area has been built for the children of the workers, called the Children's Summer Camp. The workers are busy building it, with bedrooms, dining rooms, cinemas, sick rooms, bathhouses, and a small machine factory, and all kinds of toys. For the children, a small train route, 28 miles long, is being prepared on the mountain. It will be completed in July and will accommodate 800 children aged three to seven. Returning to the Belgrade nursery, which is one of many nurseries, those children are under three years old. Some can stand, some can only sit, and some can't even sit, kicking their little feet up, moving their little hands to their feet, rolling around and playing. We looked at them through the glass windows, they looked at us with round eyes. We laughed, and they all laughed too. These are Tito's little army.

    The car passed through pine forests, following the mountain road, running forward. Soon it was an endless plain. This is the breadbasket of Yugoslavia. The wheat was already ripe, blown by the wind, creating waves in the wheat fields. In the countryside, the blue houses are where the Slavs live. Children chase and race, and pigs and cows are too late to avoid the car. The girls stared curiously at our faces, whispering to each other. After two hours, we arrived at a town. People were crowded outside a large building, with a thousand and ten thousand hands waving. People were smiling, and flags were flying. We got out of the car, and the people moved like water, opening up a gap. We walked into a large auditorium, with thunderous applause and shouts mixed together. Music played, and everyone stood up. After giving speeches to each other, the crowd cheered in satisfaction and danced Slavic dances; this was a meeting of agricultural workers. The next day we went to the farm and drank their homemade beer. An old farmer said:

    "I have been a tenant farmer for fifteen years. I have never entered the hall where we are drinking today. This hall belonged to a big landlord. He came once a year. I came once by chance, only stepping one foot inside." Today it belongs to the farmers, and the farmers are already the masters of the hall. The house where the landlord kept cattle was much better than the tenant farmer's house. The landlord didn't want to see the farmers, so he built a forest on his estate, keeping the farmers away from the estate. Now the farmers are keeping their own cattle in the house where the landlord kept cattle, and the farmers have entered the estate.

    Most of the farmers have joined collective farms. Even an old farmer in his seventies has joined. He testified that he has never lived such a good life. He excitedly and proudly raised his glass. He believed that in the near future, they would replace their horses with iron horses (tractors), and their people would become steel men, driving iron horses to cultivate the fields of Yugoslavia.

    "The people of Yugoslavia, with their blood and sweat, have overturned the painful history of many years, and they are building their motherland with unparalleled heroism."

    This is my speech to them.
      July 1st, in the capital of Yugoslavia

    在一个新兴的国家里
    刘宁一
    自到南斯拉夫之后，日夜不停的游动，曾到了波斯米、塞尔维亚、垮萨、府摸、诺维塞德、斯洛文尼亚、亚得里海边。南斯拉夫是六个共和国组织成的，经过了四年游击战争，在德意统治时期，连战死和被残杀的，一共有一百多万，他们全国一千三百万人民，平均每十一个人口中有一个人牺牲，全国在铁托领导之下，进行过长时期的抵抗，那时米海洛维区，和他的死党塞特尼克，也曾打过反德旗帜，但始终和德国人勾结着，用极残酷的手段，杀戮游击队，当杀人之后，他们就和德人一块痛饮狂欢。以后就公开和德国人合作，替德国人维持治安，作侦探。胜利之后，南国人民把米海洛维区逮捕了，公开审判，罪行昭彰，处以死刑，大快人心。在去年十月全国实行接收逆产，全部充公，就是这样，不但大地主的土地分给了农民，南奸大资本家，也经过了清算之后，扫除净尽。全国经济现进行着公营、私营、合作社经营三种形式的建设工作。土地进行大规模的合作生产，大体分为三种：国营农场、集体农场、个体农场。
    我们参观过两个最大的炼钢厂，每个有五千工人；一个煤矿一千五百工人；一个纱厂三千工人；一个针织厂四百工人；一个造酒厂五百工人；一个集体农庄三千农民。全国到处进行着建设工作，工人的生活有了很大的改善，比如说物价比战前高一倍，工资却提高了十倍。各处工会都很健全，过去资本家、买办、特务所占的大楼，变成了工会的会址，南国虽小，而工会大楼却在五层七层的大厦中。每个工人每年有一个月的休养机会，休养所是建筑在大森林中，种植了奇花异草，在园林中奔流着小泉小溪，鸟是自由的歌唱，人是快乐的玩耍。有的男女青年，搭了帐篷，在草地里山麓中，过着宿营生活，每个黄昏，烧起了野火，男男女女，携手挽臂，唱着自由的歌曲，兴奋的跳着舞。身体不好的住在疗养室，每两人一间房，有医生给调治。当我们去参观时，那些女孩子们都把头探在窗外，和我们招手，当我们进到她们的房子，却看到她们安静的睡在雪白的床上，平平的盖着淡绿的绒毯。其中一个女工，拿着一本工人杂志，温存的笑道：“同志！我正在看你关于中国解放区工人生活的谈话，你们的工人是如何的尽了保卫民族的斗争的责任！”她们微笑着亲热的爱慕着中国的英勇儿女。
    南国青年，在热烈的为了祖国的建设，舍身忘家奔赴了劳动前线，他们组织了铁道队、建筑队……我们见到了一个建筑铁路的青年队，那里只有一部分，八千多人，那里是一条大河流过的山林，山是悬崖峭壁，树是荆棘丛生，水是咆哮奔流。青年们有来自南方的、北方的、东方的、西方的、英国的、罗马尼亚的、希腊的、比国的、挪威的、匈牙利的，保加利亚的……男的女的、工人、农人、学生……在山顶上，在桥头上，在隧道边，高高的竖起了旗帜。那天是一个运动大会，成千的青年，在大河旁的山脚下开会了，有的爬在树上，有的坐在崖石上，举着锄头镢头。飞机骄傲的飞过，散下了大批的传单与画片。我们到了会场，一片掌声之后，只听到“中国解放区万岁！毛泽东万岁！中国人民解放军万岁！”群众将我们抬起来，一束一束的鲜花丢到我们的头上，我为之兴奋，兴奋的流泪！炮声连发，歌声四起，我这样简单的向他们感谢：
    “你们在铁托将军领导之下，战胜了法西斯，你们为了人民的幸福作着移山倒海的工作。中国的爱国儿女，在毛泽东领导之下，正对美国帝国主义及中国米海洛维区蒋介石，作着生死的斗争！我们要把全世界造成一个幸福的、永久和平的、愉快建设的家庭！”
    他们开了惊人的山洞，劈开了百丈的高山，已经修了四百里的铁路，这一工程，如果是旧的统治者，需要计划六年，兴工十二年，而现代青年却以三个月的奋斗，使它完成。人民为之庆祝，帝国主义为之惊奇，山河为之变色！
    这里没有为旅客设的旅馆，到了晚上，一个女同志带我到一家人家，她轻轻的敲开了门，一个中年男人，把我迎进去，那女同志道了一声“晚安”走了，那男人用手一指，又一指，我明白一边是卧室，一边是厕所，和我握过手，行了个敬礼，各自分别，房子是十分别致，挂着油画，陈设了很好的家具，我很难为情的把泥脚踏上了地毯。这是当地工人的家庭。翌日的清晨，门轻轻的敲着，那时我已经洗漱过了，一位青年妇人送进了茶点，我用过了，她和她的妹妹（这是我猜想）把我领到另一房子，拿出了刷子和皮鞋油，要给我擦鞋子。我赶快夺过来自己擦，她们却很自然的笑着，看我，把麻布拿起，帮我的忙。到后来我明白了，这里和我们的解放区一样，在反法西斯战争中，养成了一个作风，只要是反法西斯的战士、同志，无论是那里，无论是那个人，到处是家人，到处是家庭。我们一句话也不懂，但彼此一切都谅解了。临别时，她们送我到门外，我的车子开了，很远很远，她们还在招着手。
    在贝尔格莱德的山上，绿荫丛中，造了一片幽雅的别墅，这是为了工人的儿女，名之曰：儿童夏令营。工人们正在忙碌的修造，有卧室、餐室、电影院、病室、澡塘，还有一个小机器的工厂，和各种各样的玩具。为了儿童，并在山上修备了一条小火车路，共长二十八英里，七月里完竣，共容儿童三岁到七岁的八百名。回头到了贝尔格莱德的托儿所，这是很多托儿所的一个，那些儿童是三岁以下的，有会立的，有只会坐的，也有坐也不会，把小脚翘起来，把小手搬着脚，滚来滚去的玩。我们在玻璃窗内看他们，他们睁着圆圆的眼睛在看我们，我们笑了，他们大家也笑了，这就是铁托的小军队。
    汽车穿过松林，顺着山沟的公路，向前奔跑，不久就是一望无际的平原，这就是南国的面包篮。麦子已经熟了，被风吹动着，掀起了麦田的波浪。乡村里蓝的房子是斯拉夫人住的，小孩追着赛跑，猪和牛来不及的躲避汽车。姑娘们，好奇的盯着我们的脸孔，在窃窃私语。两个钟头的工夫，到了一个城镇，人们拥挤在一个大厦的外边，一千只一万只的手在招呼。人是含笑着，旗是飘扬着。我们下车了，人们同水一样在动荡，流开了一个空隙，我们走进一个大礼堂，如雷的掌声和狂呼交杂着。乐声奏起，全体肃立，彼此做过了演讲，群众满意的高呼，跳起来了斯拉夫的舞蹈；这是一个农业工人的大会。第二天我们到了农场，痛饮了他们做的啤酒，一个老农说：
    “我做佃农一十五年，我从来没进过今天我们吃酒的大厅，这一大厅是一个大地主的，他一年来一次，我是偶然来了一次，只迈进了一只脚。”今天是农民的了，农民已经是大厅的主人了。地主养牛的房子是比佃农的房子好的多，地主不愿意看见农民，把自己的庄园造了一个树林，使农民远离庄园之外。而今农民把那养牛的房子养自己的牛，农民进到了庄园之内。
    农民们大多数参加了集体农庄，连一位七十多岁的老农也参加了，他证明从来没有过过这样好的生活。他兴奋的骄傲的举起杯来，他相信不久的将来，他们会把他们的马换成铁马（拖拉机），他们的人民变为钢人，驾着铁马，去耕种这南斯拉夫的田野。
    “南斯拉夫的人民，以他们的血和汗，翻转了多少年来惨痛的历史，他们又以无比的英勇，建设着他们的祖国。”
    这是我给他们的致词。
      七月一日于南国首都
