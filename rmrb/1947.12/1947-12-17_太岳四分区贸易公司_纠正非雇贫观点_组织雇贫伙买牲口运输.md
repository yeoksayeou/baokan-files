    Taiyue Fourth District Trade Company
    Correcting the "Non-Employing Poor" Viewpoint
    Organizing the Employing Poor to Buy Livestock for Transportation
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The Fourth District Trade Company is correcting the "non-employing poor" viewpoint, vigorously resolving the production difficulties of the employing poor, and organizing the employing poor for transportation. According to Yang Yiping, manager of the Fourth District Trade Company, the trade department's viewpoint on employing the poor was very vague in the past. In the 20 days of November, the company organized 850 carts for transportation, paying over 56.15 million yuan in foot fees. After inspection, Xiaozhang Village, which had not undergone thorough land reform, received 1.56 million yuan. This shows where this huge transportation fee ended up. Since the District Party Committee called for resolving the difficulties of the employing poor and organizing them for transportation, the Fourth District Trade Company conducted internal inspections. Many people still insisted on the erroneous viewpoint that it was impossible to resolve the difficulties of the employing poor to organize them for transportation. They said, "The employing poor have no carts, no livestock, how can they transport?" "The employing poor have already cooperated with middle peasants, and loans cannot reach the employing poor." After repeated research and discussion, as long as the employing poor are organized, those without livestock or carts can cooperate with those who have them. At the same time, loans are issued, first allowing the employing poor to jointly buy livestock. For example, a long-distance transport trip can earn more than 30,000 yuan. 100,000 yuan can buy livestock, and the capital can be earned back in three trips, which also solves the problem of eating and drinking in winter. After unifying the position and understanding within the Fourth District Trade Company, 1,000 carts and 10 million loans were handed over to the employing poor. All those participating in the transportation of 1,000 carts must be introduced by the county and district governments, the loans must be certified by the government, and employing poor groups must be organized to jointly borrow, jointly purchase livestock, and jointly transport.

    纠正非雇贫观点
    组织雇贫伙买牲口运输
    【本报太岳十五日电】四分区贸易公司，纠正非雇贫观点，大力解决雇贫生产困难，组织雇贫运输。据四分区贸易公司经理杨乙平谈，过去贸易部门的雇贫观点非常模糊，在十一月的廿天中，该公司曾经组织了八百五十辆大车运输，付出脚价五千六百一十五万余元，经检查结果，未经彻底土地改革的小张村，即得了一百五十六万元，可见这笔巨大的运输费落到什么人手中。自区党委号召解决雇贫困难，组织雇贫运输后，四分区贸易公司内部即进行检查，不少人仍坚持无法解决雇贫困难来组织雇贫运输的错误观点，他们说：“雇贫无车，无牲口，如何运输？”“雇贫已与中农互助起来，贷款也落不到雇贫手中。”后经再三研究讨论后，只要组织起雇贫，无牲口无大车可与有牲口大车的合作，同时发放贷款，先让雇贫合伙买牲口，如长途运输一次即可赚三万多元，十万元买一头牲口，三次即可赚回本钱，又解决了冬季的吃喝问题。在四分区贸易公司内部，统一立场与认识后，即将一千辆大车与一千万贷款交给雇贫，所有参加一千辆大车运输的，必须经县区政府的介绍，贷款也经政府证明，并组织起雇贫小组，合伙贷、合伙购买牲口、合伙运输。
