　　The National Land Conference of the Chinese Communist Party in September formulated the "Outline Land Law of China." The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party officially announced it on October 10th, and it has now been adopted by our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region government as the region's law. This is a major event for our region!
    For more than a year, all liberated areas across the country have vigorously launched mass movements of anti-traitor liquidation, speaking out about suffering, seeking revenge, and realizing the dream of "land to the tiller." Great achievements have been made in these movements in various places, but they have not been thorough, and there are still many problems that have not been resolved or resolved well. The Chinese Communist Party believes that land reform is a prerequisite for national democratization, industrialization, independence, unity, and prosperity, and is the basic task of the Chinese revolution. In order to thoroughly complete land reform and fully satisfy the demands of the broad masses of peasants, especially farm laborers, poor peasants, and all landless and land-poor peasants, the National Land Conference was convened in September of this year. Based on the rich experience of the past twenty years, especially the past two years, the conference thoroughly studied the specific conditions in various places, listened to the urgent and fundamental demands of peasants in various places, and carefully reviewed the reasons why land reform had not been carried out thoroughly. After many discussions, sixteen measures were finally determined, which is the "Outline Land Law" published in today's newspaper. Every word and sentence of this outline represents the interests of the entire country, the entire nation, and all peasants. The vast majority of people in the liberated areas, including those in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, are the framers and legislators of this outline. If we honestly act in accordance with this outline in land reform in the future, then our land reform movement will definitely be carried out thoroughly.
    Why can the "Outline Land Law of China" guarantee that land reform is carried out thoroughly? This is because the basic content of the outline completely and appropriately solves all the problems in land reform, first and foremost, thorough equal distribution. In the past, land reform in some places was not carried out thoroughly because the land was not distributed equally, and the peasants did not completely turn over. Some landlords and rich peasants could still do evil as before, and there were problems with some distribution methods, and some people occupied more of the fruits and became the new rulers of the countryside. The "Outline Land Law" stipulates that the ownership of all landlords and all public groups' land should be abolished, and the land of rich peasants should be subject to redistribution by taking from those who have more and giving to those who have less, taking from the fertile land to supplement the barren land, and distributing it uniformly and equally according to the entire population of the village, so that all villagers can obtain the same share of land, and it will be privately owned by each person. That is to say, land must be distributed equally, the feudal and semi-feudal land system of exploitation must be eliminated, and the land system of "land to the tiller" must be fully realized.
    In order to realize land reform, the outline clearly stipulates the class line. In accordance with the spirit of the "Outline Land Law," in the future, in the countryside, on the one hand, farm laborers, poor peasants, rural workers, and all landless and land-poor peasants, who in the past were exploited, abused, persecuted, insulted, and looked down upon, and lived a miserable life, should be the backbone and leaders of the village, and unite with all middle peasants to become the people in power. On the other hand, landlords and rich peasants who exploited and abused people in the past should be clearly distinguished between good and evil. Although the outline is very generous, stipulating that landlords can also be given a share and rich peasants can also keep a share, that they can honestly transform themselves, engage in labor, and enjoy the fruits of their own labor; however, the outline also sternly stipulates that they must not interfere in anything during the movement, nor can they participate in the government during the transition period, and they are not allowed to sow discord and sabotage in secret. From now on, the liberated areas' countryside will be the world of honest and hardworking peasants.
    Farm laborers, poor peasants, and all other poor people are the most conscious, the most active, and the most serious in land reform because they are the poorest. They are the main force in land reform, and with them taking the lead, it can be guaranteed to be done thoroughly. "Ask the poor if it's fair or not," this spirit is also clearly stipulated in the outline. For example, it is stipulated that village peasant conferences, poor peasant group conferences, and farmers' representative conferences at all levels are the legal organs of power for carrying out land reform, and we must ensure their implementation. At the same time, in order to ensure that the interests, will, and democratic rights of the broad masses of peasants are not harmed, peasants have the right to criticize, impeach, freely remove and elect all cadres in the government and peasant organizations, so that the broad masses of peasants are truly in power and are their own masters.
    It is because the outline solves the above-mentioned basic problems and all other problems that resolutely implementing the "Outline Land Law" can thoroughly carry out land reform and can solve the problems that have not been or cannot be solved in various places, so it is the first great charter made by Chinese peasants themselves in thousands of years. Our region has achieved considerable success in land reform over the past year and has accumulated rich experience. Now the guidelines and policies are clearer, and the methods are more specific. Whether the 30 million peasants in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu can completely turn over, and whether they can thoroughly overthrow the feudal and semi-feudal land system of exploitation that has existed for thousands of years, depends entirely on how our efforts this time are decided. We call on every party member and all working people in the entire border region to devote all their strength to the thorough realization of this law. Anyone who openly or secretly obstructs or sabotages the realization of this law, whether he is a landlord, a bully, a military or political cadre, or a Communist Party member, we must ruthlessly strike and punish him. For the benefit of 30 million people, and in order to complete this glorious revolutionary task, we firmly believe that this land reform movement will be successfully completed, and the work of the party, government, army, and people in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu will be completely renewed in the future. Feudalism must be overthrown, and the peasants must be liberated. Anyone who attempts to obstruct this historical movement will be like an egg hitting a stone, and he will only perish, and he must perish.

### 拥护中国土地法大纲彻底平分土地！

　　拥护中国土地法大纲彻底平分土地！
    中国共产党九月全国土地会议，制定了中国土地法大纲。中国共产党中央委员会在十月十号正式公布，现在已经被我晋冀鲁豫边区政府采用，成为本边区的法令了。这是我区的一件大事！
    一年多以来，全国各解放区都轰轰烈烈的掀起了反奸清算诉苦复仇实现耕者有其田的群众运动。在这一运动中，各地都做出了很大成绩，可是又都做得不彻底，都还有许多问题没有解决或解决的不好。中国共产党认为土地改革是国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的前提条件，是中国革命的基本任务，为着彻底完成土地改革充分满足广大农民首先是雇农、贫农及一切无地少地农民的要求，于本年九月召开了全国土地会议。这个会议根据过去二十年来特别近两年来的丰富经验，详细研究了各地的具体情况，倾听了各地农民迫切的与根本的要求，并认真检讨了土地改革没有进行彻底的原因，经过多次的讨论，终于定出了十六条办法，这就是今天报上发表的土地法大纲。这个大纲每字每句，都代表着全国家、全民族、全体农民的利益。各解放区绝大多数的老百姓，包括晋冀鲁豫的在内，都是这个大纲的制定者立法人。如果我们以后在土地改革中老老实实的按照这个大纲办事，那么我们的土地改革运动是一定能够进行彻底的。
    为什么中国土地法大纲能够保证土地改革进行得彻底呢？这是因为大纲的基本内容完全的适当的解决了土地改革中的一切问题，首先是彻底平分。过去有些地方土地改革没有进行彻底，就是因为土地没有分得平，农民没有翻透身，有些地主富农还能照旧为非作歹，有些在分配方法上出了毛病，某些人多占了果实，变成了农村的新统治者。土地法大纲规定废除一切地主及一切公共团体土地的所有权，对富农土地则进行抽多补少、抽肥补瘦，并按乡村全部人口统一平均分配，使全乡村人民都能获得同样一份土地，并且归各人私有。这就是说，土地非平分不可，封建性与半封建性剥削的土地制度非消灭不可，耕者有其田的土地制度则必须全部实现。
    为了实现土地改革，大纲对阶级路线规定十分明确。依照土地法大纲的精神，今后乡村中，一方面是过去被剥削被虐待被迫害被侮辱被人轻视，过着惨苦日子的雇农、贫农、乡村工人及一切无地少地农民要做村里的骨干、领导者，并团结全体中农，成为当权者。另一方面是过去剥削人虐待人的地主与富农，善恶分清，壁垒分明。大纲虽然很宽大，规定地主可以同样分一份，富农可以同样留一份，他们可以老老实实的改造自己，从事劳动，并且可以享受他们自己的劳动果实；可是大纲亦很严肃的规定，他们决不能过问运动中的一切事情，在过渡期间亦不能参加政权，更不容许他们挑拨离间，暗中捣乱。从今以后，解放区农村已是忠厚勤劳的农民的天下了。
    雇农、贫农和其他一切贫民因为最穷，所以在土地改革中最自觉、最积极、最认真。他们是土地改革中的主力大军，由他们带头，可以保证做得彻底。“平不平，问穷人”，这个精神在大纲中也是明确规定了的。如规定乡村农民大会、贫农团大会及各级农代会是进行土地改革的合法的权力机关，我们必须保证执行。同时，为着保证广大农民群众的利益、意志和民主权利不受损害，农民有权批评、弹劾、自由撤换和选举政府及农民团体中的一切干部，使广大农民真正是当权者，是自己的主人。
    就是因为大纲解决了上述基本问题以及其他一切问题，所以坚决执行土地法大纲就能把土地改革进行彻底，并且能解决各地所没有或不能解决的问题，所以它是数千年来中国农民自己制定的第一部大宪章。我区在一年多以来的土地改革已获得了相当的成绩，积累了丰富的经验，现在方针政策是更明确了，办法也更具体了，今后晋冀鲁豫三千万的农民，是否能够完全翻身，是否能彻底推翻数千年来的封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度，就完全看我们这次的努力如何来决定。我们号召全边区每个党员和全体劳动人民，拿出一切力量，为这一法令的彻底实现而奋斗。任何明的暗的阻挠破坏这一法令的实现的，不管他是地主、恶霸，抑或是军政干部或是共产党员，我们都要无情地给以打击惩罚。为着三千万人民的利益，为着完成这一光荣的革命任务，我们坚决相信，这次的土地改革运动一定能顺利成功，晋冀鲁豫党政军民各方面工作今后一定会焕然一新，封建一定要推翻，农民一定要解放，任何妄图阻挠这历史运动的，就是鸡蛋碰石头，他只有灭亡，而且一定要灭亡。
