　　[News from this newspaper] The land conference for the entire region, convened by the Central Bureau, victoriously concluded on the 26th after eighty-five days of heated and intense discussion. Over 1,700 cadres at the county and regimental level attended the conference. With a serious and responsible attitude towards the Party and the people, the conference earnestly exposed various errors in the land reform, studied the historical and social roots of making these errors, and formulated specific measures to correct them, further understanding the Party's correct principles and lines.

　　In his opening address on October 2nd, Comrade Bo Yibo, representing the presidium, pointed out that the purpose of the conference was to accept the resolutions of the National Land Conference of the Communist Party of China and the Outline Land Law of China formulated by it. To this end, it was first necessary to seriously examine the reasons why the land reform in this region had been incomplete in the past year or more. He demanded that the delegates present conduct their review with a class perspective and an honest attitude, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and rectify the ranks ideologically, politically, organizationally, and in terms of discipline; to discuss in detail with new viewpoints and a new spirit how to implement the Outline Land Law of China in this region, so as to achieve thorough and equal distribution of land, eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation of the land system, and meet the demands of the peasants. After the meeting, the delegates suppressed the "almost there" mentality, complacency, and desire to claim credit, earnestly accepted the spirit of the conference, and prepared to conduct a review.

　　Subsequently, the heads of the delegation from Ji'nan, Ji'lu'yu, Taihang, Taiyue, and Yu'wan'su reported on the land reform situation in their respective regions. From these reports, it was preliminarily reviewed that the land reform in the past year in various regions was not "almost there," but rather "far from it"; the main reason for its incompleteness was that the landlord and rich peasant ideology within the Party was quite serious, as well as bureaucraticism in leadership, with the result that hired and poor peasants had not been thoroughly liberated, and some had not even been liberated yet. The delegates were greatly shocked by this and became vigilant. They then conducted preliminary reviews in group meetings, and began to unearth the serious situation of impurity within the Party.

　　讨论贯彻中国土地法大纲
  　全区土地会议胜利闭幕
  　依靠雇贫打倒地主彻底平分土地整顿队伍严整阵容改造各级组织
    【本报讯】中央局召开的全区土地会议经过八十五天热烈紧张讨论，已于二十六日胜利闭幕。此次到会的共有县级、团级以上干部一千七百多人。大会以对党对人民严肃负责态度，认真揭发了土地改革中的各种错误，研究了犯错误的历史的和社会的根源，并订出修正错误的具体办法，进一步体会了党的正确原则路线。
    薄一波同志在十月二日代表主席团所作的开幕辞中即已指出：大会目的是在接受中国共产党全国土地会议决议及其所制定的中国土地法大纲，为此首先要认真检查本区过去一年多土地改革不彻底的原因何在？要求到会代表拿阶级观点、老实态度去检讨，发扬批评和自我批评的精神，从思想上、政治上、组织上、纪律上整顿队伍；以新的观点、新的精神详细讨论如何在本区施行中国土地法大纲，以便达到彻底平分土地，消灭封建性与半封建性剥削的土地制度，满足农民要求。会后，各代表抑制了“差不多”思想、自满及要求表功情绪，认真接受大会精神，准备进行检查。
    接着冀南、冀鲁豫、太行、太岳、豫皖苏各代表团负责人汇报各该区土改情况，从这些汇报中已初步检讨出一年来各区土地改革不是“差不多”，而是“差的多”；其不彻底的原因，主要的是由于党内地主富农思想相当严重和领导上的官僚主义，以致雇贫没有翻透身，有的还没有翻身。代表们为之大吃一惊，警惕起来，旋即在小组会中各自作了初步检查，开始发掘党内不纯的严重情况。
