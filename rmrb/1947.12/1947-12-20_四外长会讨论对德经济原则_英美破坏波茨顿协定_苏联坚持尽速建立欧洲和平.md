Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: London dispatch: From the 4th to the 8th, the Foreign Ministers' meeting intensely debated the issue of German assets in Austria and economic principles for Germany. According to the Potsdam Agreement, all German assets in eastern Austria should be fully compensated to the Soviet Union. When the Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed the issue of German assets in Austria on the 4th, the French representative followed the position of the United States and Britain, undermining the Potsdam Agreement. It advocated that only one-third of the exploration rights and one-half of the production of German oil fields in eastern Austria should be given to the Soviet Union, and the remaining German assets in Austria should be converted into goods worth 100 million US dollars to the Soviet Union. The US and Britain supported the French opinion in order to plunder most of the Soviet Union's rights and interests and restore the control of their monopoly capitalists over the economy of eastern Austria. After Molotov criticized the US and Britain for this conspiracy and ambition, for the sake of rapidly striving for peace in Europe, he agreed that the Soviet Union would receive 10% less than stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. However, the US and British representatives were still insatiably greedy and hindered the issue from reaching an agreement. On the 5th and 6th, the Foreign Ministers' meeting turned to discuss the issue of German economic principles. On the one hand, Marshall chanted platitudes such as so-called "economic unity" and avoided mentioning the issue of German reparations. On the other hand, US representative Dulles ran to Paris during the Foreign Ministers' meeting to secretly negotiate with France to merge the French-occupied zone of Germany into the British-American joint occupation zone in order to split Germany. Molotov resolutely opposed this, believing that without the unity of German democratic politics, there would be no real economic unity. The United States' prior formation of a West German government with Britain and France showed its lack of sincerity in resolving German economic unity and other issues, and undermined the Potsdam Agreement. On the 5th, Bevin put forward a so-called "supplementary plan for dealing with Germany," which even stated: "If the principles in the Potsdam Agreement conflict with this principle, the latter should be the basis." The representatives of the US, Britain, and France unanimously colluded to demand that the British proposal be used as the basic plan for discussing German economic principles. Molotov vigorously opposed this conspiracy, believing that the plan not only revised the Potsdam Agreement but also erased all the agreements on German economic issues reached by the four foreign ministers at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' meeting. The Soviet Union would never accept the forced discussion of the US, Britain, and France. On the 6th, Molotov also put forward the Soviet Union's plan, advocating the immediate establishment of a central administrative department for the German economy and the cancellation of the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones. It also believed that the level of German industry could be raised, with steel production increasing to 12 million tons; however, Germany should unconditionally fulfill reparations and other basic tasks. After the above situation is completed, free circulation of goods throughout Germany should be implemented. Thanks to the Soviet Union's unremitting struggle to uphold the principles of justice, it shattered the US and Britain's intimidating conspiracies to break up the meeting. The Foreign Ministers' meeting finally agreed on the 8th to the Soviet Union's compromise proposal, that is, to use the Soviet and British plans as the basis for discussing German economic principles.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: Moscow dispatch: A Pravda observer wrote on the 7th: The characteristic of the London Foreign Ministers' meeting in the past two weeks was the Soviet Union's unremitting struggle to strive for the establishment of European peace as soon as possible. Even some bourgeois newspapers in the US and Britain have to admit that it was only because of the Soviet delegation's unwavering desire to strive for unity that the meeting reached agreements on some issues of the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty. (Note: These agreements are: (1) When drafting the draft of the German peace treaty, the Foreign Ministers' meeting should consider the proposals of two-thirds or more than one-half of the countries participating in the peace conference and voting. (2) The German peace treaty should be ratified by the German government. However, when discussing the establishment of a democratic German central government, the countries participating in the peace conference, German assets in Austria, and other major issues, the attitude of the US delegation was obviously against international cooperation and lacked sincerity in reaching a consensus. Britain and France consistently obediently followed the leadership of the US delegation. The Soviet Union suggested that the rapid establishment of a democratic and unified German central government should be a prerequisite for Germany to accept the peace treaty. Marshall actually called this a "troublesome issue," and Bevin and Bidault echoed him. No matter what tricks the US-British bloc representatives play at the meeting, they cannot hide their conspiracy from the world, that is, to divide Germany and organize a puppet government composed of two or three occupation zones, so as to turn West Germany into their military and economic base. Their adventurous approach violates international interests and the sovereignty of European countries and is a major obstacle to the establishment of world democratic peace. The crux of the Foreign Ministers' meeting's differences lies here: The Soviet Union starts from democratic peace to deal with various German issues, while the US-British bloc stubbornly adheres to its imperialist peace line in an attempt to enslave Germany and enslave other large and small countries in the world.

### 四外长会讨论对德经济原则  英美破坏波茨顿协定  苏联坚持尽速建立欧洲和平

    四外长会讨论对德经济原则
    英美破坏波茨顿协定
    苏联坚持尽速建立欧洲和平
    【新华社陕北十二日电】伦敦讯：四日至八日，外长会议激烈辩论德国在奥资产及对德经济原则问题。按照波茨顿协议，德国在奥国东部之资产应全部赔偿予苏联。外长会于四日讨论德国在奥资产问题时，法国代表尾随美英的立场，破坏波茨顿协议，主张仅以奥国东部德人油田三分之一的勘采权及二分之一的产量给予苏联，其余在奥德人资财则折合价值一亿美元之商品予苏。美英支持法国意见，以便劫掠苏联大部权益，而为其独占资本家恢复对奥国东部经济之控制。莫洛托夫于抨斥美英此种阴谋野心之后，为迅速争取欧洲和平计，答应苏联少得波茨顿协议所规定的百分之十。但美英代表仍贪得无餍，又阻碍此一问题达到协议。五六两日外长会议转入讨论德国经济原则问题，一方面，马歇尔高唱所谓“经济统一”等滥调，对德国赔偿问题避而不提，另一方面美代表杜勒斯则于外长会议开会期间，跑到巴黎与法国密商将德境法占领区合并于英美联合占领区，以分裂德国。莫洛托夫对此予以坚决反对，认为没有德国民主政治的统一，就不会有真正的经济统一，美国事先与英法筹组西部德国政府，说明其缺乏解决德国经济统一与其他问题的诚意，破坏了波茨顿协议。五日贝文提出一项所谓“处理德国补充方案”，竟谓：“若波茨顿协定中之原则与此一原则发生抵触时，应以后者为根据”。美英法代表并一致勾结要求将英国提案作为讨论德国经济原则的基本方案。莫洛托夫竭力反对此种阴谋，认为该方案不仅修改了波茨顿协定，而且抹煞了莫斯科外长会议时四外长关于德国经济问题已获得的一切协议。苏联绝不接受美英法的强迫讨论。六日，莫洛托夫并提出苏联之方案，主张立即设立德国经济之中央行政管理部门，取消英美占领区的经济合并。并认为可以提高德国工业水平，钢产增至一千二百万吨；但德国应无条件履行赔偿及其他基本任务，在上述情形完成后，实行全德货物自由流通。由于苏联为坚持正义原则之不懈斗争，粉碎了美英叫嚣破裂会议之恫吓阴谋，外长会议终于八日同意苏联之折衷建议，即以苏英两国方案，作为讨论德国经济原则之基础。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】莫斯科讯：真理报观察家七日撰文称：两周来伦敦外长会议之特点，为苏联坚持不懈的斗争，以争取尽速建立欧洲和平。甚至美英某些资产阶级的报纸，也不得不承认：仅因苏联代表团坚定不移的争取团结的愿望，才使会议在对德和约准备程序的某些问题上获得协议。（按这些协议是：（一）外长会议在草拟对德和约定稿时，对参加和会国家与投票国家的三分之二或二分之一以上的建议，应予考虑。（二）对德和约应由德国政府批准。但在讨论建立民主德国中央政府、参与和会之国家、德国在奥资财及其他重大问题时，美国代表团的态度，则显然反对国际合作并缺乏一致协议的诚意。英法则一贯驯服的服从美代表团的领导。苏联建议迅速建立民主统一的德国中央政府以为德国接受和约之先决条件，马歇尔竟称这是一个“麻烦问题”，贝文与比道尔也随声附和。不管美英集团的代表在会上玩弄何种诡计，总不能向世界掩蔽其阴谋，即分袋德国及组织两个或三个占领区联合的傀儡政府，以便把西部德国变成他们的军事经济基地。他们这种冒险的办法，违反国际利益和欧洲各国的主权，并为建立世界民主和平的主要障碍。外长会议纷歧的症结正在这里：苏联从民主和平出发，以处理对德各项问题，美英集团则顽固地坚持其帝国主义和平的路线，以图奴役德国，奴役世界其他大小国家。
