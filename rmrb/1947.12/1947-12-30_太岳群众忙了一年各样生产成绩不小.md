(Our newspaper Taiyue dispatch on the 28th) The Taiyue region's 1947 production work, amidst the intense task of participating in the war and supporting the front, overcame natural disasters and achieved brilliant results. First, organization was strengthened. Taking Yangcheng County as an example, 86.8% of households were organized, along with 70% of male full laborers, 90.8% of male semi-laborers, 78% of female full laborers, and 84.2% of female semi-laborers. This demonstrates the exceptional development in the scale of organization of women and semi-laborers, enabling the release of sufficient male full laborers to support the Great Counter-Offensive. The "Three Combinations Mutual Aid" in Yuneng Village, Jincheng, closely integrated agricultural and sideline production with participation in the war. In particular, the practice of the "rely on the poor" line in winter production has unfolded large-scale textile and transportation efforts in Tunliu, Yangcheng, Qinyuan, and other places. Sun Qunsuo, a cadre in the Jiaquan base point in Jincheng, was able to personally visit poor households, understand their difficulties, help them make plans, form "rely on the poor" groups, promote production work, recover old loans, and solve the production difficulties of the poor. With the leadership of the "rely on the poor" policy, the mutual aid organizations underwent qualitative changes, and production achievements rapidly improved. Second, disasters were overcome, and harvests increased. In terms of the area affected by natural disasters, drought was widespread across four districts, particularly in the border regions, which suffered damage from the Chiang-Yan bandit troops. The masses immediately rose up in resolute struggle. Jiyuan and Yuqu implemented a combination of labor and military force in rushing to plant and harvest, and the enemy's sabotage conspiracies were severely hit and went bankrupt. Regarding overcoming natural disasters, according to incomplete statistics from five counties—Fushan, Jiyuan, Yangcheng, Jincheng, and Qinshui—340 new and old canals were opened, seeds were planted by carrying water on more than 62,000 mu of land, seedlings were watered by carrying water on more than 2,800 mu of land, 23 waterwheels were installed, and 128,000 mu of land was irrigated. The masses were not intimidated by the disasters, and their enthusiasm for rushing to plant, replant, and plant seeds was very high. They also collected 142,9350 jin of wild vegetables to prepare for overcoming the famine. As a result of the masses' struggle against the disaster, Jincheng's ninth district managed to achieve 80% of a normal harvest despite a 50% crop failure, and Qinyuan managed to achieve a good harvest despite a bad year. Third, the "Three Autumns" movement surpassed any previous year. At that time, the Great Counter-Offensive had just begun, and a large number of laborers followed the army on expeditions. Women, children, and old men were fully mobilized. In Zhangma and other villages in Qinyuan, semi-laborers harvested 80% of the total acreage. In planting "Counter-Offensive Wheat," according to statistics from Yangcheng, Qinshui, Jiyuan, and Jincheng counties, the wheat fields were expanded by 226,820 mu compared to last year. Regarding autumn plowing, statistics from Jincheng on November 7 showed that 83.1% had been plowed, Yangcheng had plowed over 95.26%, and Qinshui had plowed over 80%. In eliminating uncultivated land, according to statistics from nine counties—Changzi, Gaoping, Qin County, Qinyuan, Jiexiu, Fushan, Jincheng, Tunliu, and Jiyuan—there were 45,878 mu and 5 li, which could increase production by 100,000 shi.

　　太岳群众忙了一年各样生产成绩不小
    【本报太岳二十八日电】太岳全区一九四七年生产工作，在紧张的参战支前任务中，战胜了自然灾害，获得煌辉成绩。第一、组织起来。从阳城全县看来，占总户数的百分之八十六点八，组织起男全劳力百分之七十，男半劳力百分之九十点八，女全劳力百分之七十八，女半劳力百分之八十四点二。这说明妇女与半劳力的组织规模，异常发展，使有充分的男全劳力拿出来，支援大反攻。晋城庾能村的“三合互助”，从土地互助使农副业与参战取得密切结合。尤其是冬季生产中的雇贫路线实践的结果，在屯留、阳城、沁源等地的大纺织、大运输已经展开。晋城贾泉基点干部孙群锁，能亲自挨户访问雇贫痛苦，帮助订计划，组成雇贫小组，推动生产工作，收回旧贷款，解决雇贫生产困难。由于有了雇贫领导，使互助组织起了质的变化，生产成绩迅速提高。第二、战胜灾害，增加收成。在自然灾害面积上，旱灾普及四个分区，特别边沿地区，受到蒋阎匪军的破坏，群众即起来坚决斗争，济源、垣曲实行劳武结合的抢种、抢收，匪军的破坏阴谋，受到严重打击而破产。在战胜自然灾害上，据浮山、济源、阳城、晋城、沁水五县不完全统计，开新旧渠三百四十条，挑水点种六万二千多亩，担水浇苗二千八百多亩，按水车廿三架，浇地十二万八千亩。群众没被灾害吓住，抢种、补种、点种热情十分高涨，并且打了一百四十二万九千三百五十斤野菜，准备渡过灾荒。但结果由于群众与灾荒的斗争，晋城九区五成年景争取到八成收，沁源的坏年景也争取到好年成。第三、三秋运动超过以往任何一年。当时正是大反攻开始，大批劳力随军远征，妇女、儿童、老汉充分动员，沁源张马等村，半劳力收割总亩数的百分之八十。在种“反攻麦”上，据阳城、沁水、济源、晋城四县统计，比去年扩大麦田二十二万六千八百廿亩。在秋垡方面，晋城十一月七号统计材料，显示已垡完百分之八十三点一，阳城垡过百分之九十五点二六，沁水垡过百分之八十。在消灭生熟荒上，依据长子、高平、沁县、沁源、介休、浮山、晋城、屯留、济源九县的统计，有四万五千八百七十八亩零五厘，可以增产十万石。
