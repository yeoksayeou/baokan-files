Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 2nd. During the Qingfengdian and Liberation of Shizhuang campaigns, our unit implemented battlefield love for soldiers, emphasized skills, and produced many new "Cai Chunji Platoon/Squads." Liu Zhongtian, the platoon leader of the second platoon of the seventh company of a certain unit, under the specific guidance of the company, carried out extremely strict combat organization, and the firepower team also had a clear division of labor. During the attack, he carefully investigated the terrain, carefully selected the breakthrough point, and commanded flexibly. When the enemy showed signs of a counterattack, he discovered that the fuse of the landmine was burning for too long, so he tried to improve it in time and implement fire cover, repelling more than a hundred enemy charges and solving two platoons of the enemy. The entire platoon suffered no casualties. Wang Shadai, the platoon leader of the second platoon of the fourth company of the same unit, personally went forward to check the terrain sixteen times in the Qingfengdian annihilation battle, and constantly revised the plan according to the situation. Their company conquered four courtyards without any casualties. Zhao Caitong, the platoon leader of the second platoon of the fifth company of a certain unit, when attacking Huage Village, the ditch hundreds of meters away from the enemy was full of people, and the good terrain became bad terrain. He immediately ordered the entire platoon to go to the open ground and attack the enemy in a combat formation with a low posture, resulting in no casualties. He found that the enemy's gun emplacements were very low and firmly ordered: "Stand up and leap forward individually." One soldier was injured when he lay down without obeying orders. The first squad of the third company of a certain unit persisted in its position during the battle of Shizhuang, defeating four enemy charges, and the entire squad suffered no casualties. The reasons are: (1) Grasp the situation in time, achieve flexible command, and do not fight confused battles. Where guns are fired and artillery is fired, the squad leader asks his superiors while paying attention to investigating the enemy's direction, distance, and number, and explains to the whole squad. When defending the streets of Shizhuang, let the soldiers rest while he monitors the enemy. (2) Care for the soldiers everywhere and do not be sloppy when building fortifications. He personally checks the terrain and position of each person to see if it is appropriate, and studies whether the digging is solid. Without tasks or orders, no one is allowed to stick their heads out of the fortifications, and eating is not allowed in the trenches. (3) The formation is dispersed, and the actions are concealed and rapid. When the squad spreads out, there has never been a case of clumping together. (4) Understand the combat style of each soldier, do not misuse them, and do not take risks. For example, the deputy squad leader, Song Ba, has always been fierce and rushed forward in battles, but he will never let him go when the situation is unclear. When a fierce attack is needed, let him display his skills. Liberated soldier Song Xicai has combat experience, so he arranged Liu Xiaowu, who has poor skills, in his group to take care of him. The whole squad loves each other and performs better on the battlefield.

　　清风店及石庄战斗中
    涌现大批新钢铁班
    指挥灵活永不打糊涂仗
    【新华社晋察冀二日电】在清风店及解放石庄战役中，我某部贯彻战场爱兵，讲究技术，涌现出不少新的“蔡春吉班、排”。某部七连二排排长刘忠田在连营具体指导下，进行了极严密的战斗组织，火力队亦有明确分工，进攻时，详细调查地形，慎重选择突破口，指挥灵活，当敌有反击征象时，他发现地雷的导火线燃烧时间过长，就设法及时改进实行火力掩护，打退百余敌人冲锋，解决了敌人两个排。全排无一伤亡。该部四连二排排长王傻呆于清风店歼灭战中，亲自上前察看地形十六次，根据情况，不断修正计划，他们连克四院，无一伤亡。某部五连二排排长赵才同，进攻化各村时，离敌百余公尺的道沟内，挤满了人，好地形变成了坏地形，他即命令全排到开阔地，以战斗队形低姿向敌进攻，结果无一伤亡，他发现敌人枪眼很低，坚决命令：“立着身子各个跃进”，一个战士不听命令卧倒负伤。某部三连一班在石庄战斗中，坚持阵地，打垮敌人四次冲锋，全班无一伤亡。其原因是：（一）及时掌握情况，作到指挥灵活，不打糊涂仗，那里打枪打炮，班长一面询问上级，一面自己留心考察敌人在那个方向？多远？多少人？同时向全班解释。坚持石庄市街战时，让战士们休息，自己来监视敌人。（二）处处关心战士做工事不马虎，亲自给每个人看地形位置是否恰当，并研究挖好了是不是巩固，没有任务命令，谁也不许在工事外面探头探脑，火线上不集中吃饭。（三）队形疏散，动作隐蔽迅速，该班拉开时，从没有过打疙瘩。（四）了解每个战士的战斗作风，不乱用，不冒险，如班副宋八向来打仗猛打猛冲，但情况不情楚时，决不放手让他去，需要猛冲时，就让他施展本领。解放战士宋喜财有战斗经验，把技术较差的刘小武编在他组里，让他照顾。全班互相友爱，在战场上作得更好。
