　　Liquidation Movement
    By Michael Straight, translated by Da Si
    Straight is an American farmer-writer and organizer of farmers' movements. This article reflects the situation in the liberated areas during the early stages of land reform. The original was published in the school magazine of Melville Manzhou Putnam City School in the United States and reprinted in other American labor publications, demonstrating the concern and importance that the American working class and farmers attach to our land reform movement.
　　——Translator
    In Asia, the biggest thing today is the land reform being carried out by the Chinese Communists. This earth-shattering movement dwarfs even the major events that have occurred in Asia over the past two decades—from the rise and collapse of Japanese imperialism and the expansion of American power in the Pacific to the Chinese Civil War.

    In North China, since the Japanese surrender, sixty million impoverished farmers have gained land. This is the greatest land distribution movement in history, and it has only just begun. In the coming years, this movement is bound to expand throughout China, to Southeast Asia, and further, to India.

    In North China, farmers have used the method of liquidation to reclaim land. The procedure is simple and clear. In each village where land reform is implemented, meetings are held, and landlords are brought one by one before the masses. In such open-air gatherings, before the eyes of the entire village, those who have been exploited by the landlords pour out their grievances, expose the landlords’ crimes, and demand land for liquidation.

    When warlords and Japanese imperialists conscripted soldiers, didn't the landlords threaten the sons of tenant farmers to serve in the army in place of their own sons? Now, he must compensate with land for the loss of the tenant farmer's son serving in the army for many years. Didn’t the landlord seize the village’s public property for his own benefit? Then he must compensate with land. Didn’t the landlord force the tenant’s wife to perform unpaid labor for his family? Then it must be estimated how much laundry she washed and how many years of chores she did, and be compensated with land. Hasn't the landlord engaged in massive rent exploitation of the tenants? Then he must repay with land. Didn't the landlord carry out various illegal exactions from the "weak" farmers around him? Then he must also compensate with land.

    In this way, the crimes of feudal exploitation for thousands of years are exposed and corrected. Once the Kuomintang troops are driven away and the local tyrant gentry's hired armed forces are disarmed, the farmers bravely rise up and carry out liquidation. In such a liquidation movement, the sinful old society is swept away, and a new society is created. Feudal society has become a democratic society where tillers own their land. Everyone has the right to vote. It is no longer possible for one person to ride on the heads of the people and wield power.

    If the landlord can work like others, he is left with enough land to live on. He can no longer collect illegal extortionate rent; he can no longer embezzle the village’s public property; he can no longer oppress other people’s sons to do hard labor for him or do household chores for him for free. He can no longer instigate police thugs to take over lawsuits. He can no longer use the power of life and death over the people in the village. Such power can no longer be concentrated in one person’s hands, because no one will hoard such vast wealth to raise openly plundering violence anymore. Law and order become everyone’s responsibility.

    From now on, in North China, people will not look at wealth, but at work. Farmers are experiencing that cooperation can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Along with land reform, labor mutual aid movements are being carried out everywhere. All creativity is brought into play. Feudal capital has been eliminated; on this basis, industrial capital will be further developed; unprecedented productive enterprises of all kinds will emerge vigorously.

    Land reform is the key to the rebirth of Asia. This movement is bound to win because half of humanity living on that continent has no other way out. Warships, cannons, armies, and airplanes may delay land reform; but they can never stop it. Even the "powerful" atomic bomb cannot stop it.

　　清算运动
    麦凯尔·拉赛作  大思译
    拉赛是美国农民作家与农民运动的组织者。这篇文章所反映的是解放区土改初期的情况。原文载美维尔满州普特耐城中学的校刊上，并经美国其他劳工刊物转载，足见美国工农阶级对于我们土地改革运动的关心与重视。
　　——译者
    在亚洲，今天最大的一桩事情，是中共所正在实行的土地改革。这一惊天动地的运动，比起二十年来亚洲所发生的重大事件——从日本帝国主义的兴起与崩溃，美国在太平洋上势力的扩张，以至中国内战——，那就显得后者都微小了。
    在华北，自从日本投降以后，六千万贫苦农民已经得到土地。这是有史以来最伟大的分田运动，而且刚才开始。在未来几年之内，这一运动，必然要扩展到全中国，以至东南亚，而且要进一步，扩展到印度。
    在华北，农民们用了清算的方法，收回土地。手续是简单明了的。在每个实行土地改革的村庄里，开起会来，把地主一个一个地带到群众面前。就在这样的露天大会里，在全村人的见证下，被地主压榨过的人们，诉起苦来，揭发了地主的罪恶，要求拿土地清算。
    在军阀与日本帝国主义抓丁的时候，地主不是威胁着雇农的儿子，去替他的儿子当兵么？现在他必须拿土地来赔偿许多年雇农儿子替他当兵的损失。地主不是霸占村里的公产去自肥么？那就必须拿土地来清偿。地主不是强迫佃户的妻子白白给他家庭服劳役么？那就必须估计她洗了多少衣服，做了多少年杂活，用土地来清偿。地主对于佃农不是进行了巨额租子的剥削么？那就必须拿土地清还。地主对其周围的“弱小”农民们，不是有过各式各样的非法榨取么？那就也必须用土地清偿。
    这样，几千年来封建剥削的罪恶，就被揭发，而且被纠正过来。一到把国民党军队赶跑，把地方土顽的雇庸武装解除了以后，农民们就勇敢地起来，进行清算。在这样的清算运动中，罪恶的旧社会，一扫而光；而产生了一个新的社会。封建社会变成了一个耕者有其田的民主社会。人人都有了选举权。这就再不可能有一个人骑在众人头上掌权的事情了。
    如果地主能象别人同样劳动的话，给他留的是足够维持生活的土地。他再不能收非法盘剥的租子；再不能私吞村里的公产；再不能压迫别人的儿子，给他做苦工，或给他白做家里的杂活。他再不能嗾使狗腿警察，包揽词讼。他再不能对于村里人民，使用生杀予夺的权柄。这样的权柄，再不可能集中到一个人手里，因为没有人会再霸占偌大的财富，去豢养公开掠夺的暴力了。法律与秩序成了每个人的责任。
    从今以后，在华北，人们不看财富，而要看工作了。农民们正在体验着：合作起来，就能够事半功倍。随着土地改革，到处开展了劳动互助运动。一切创造力都发挥起来。封建资本消灭了；在这样的基础上，更进一步，工业资本便会得到新的发展；前所未有的各种生产企业，便会蓬勃涌现出来。
    土地改革是亚洲新生的关键。这一运动必然赢得胜利，因为住在那个大陆上的半数的人类只有这条出路。军舰、大炮、军队、飞机，可能延缓了土地改革；可是绝对停止不了它的。就是“强大”的原子弹也不能停止了它。
