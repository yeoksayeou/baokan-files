　　Sunjia Village
  　Winter School Opens
    [This newspaper Gaoyi News] Under the call from the masses during the winter slack season for progress during the long nights, Sunjia Village has successively established men's and women's people's schools. And put forward the slogan "Automatically go to school to seek progress, study so as not to fall behind others." Teachers are not selected as fixed, and a mutual learning method is adopted, where everyone can be a teacher and everyone is a student. Whoever knows what, whoever understands what, whoever will speak about it. According to everyone's requirements, the following courses are proposed: (1) Reading newspapers, (2) Discussing policies and laws, (3) Learning production technology (commerce, agriculture, industry, textiles, weaving), (4) Learning culture (literacy and singing). Under everyone's enthusiastic requests, the masses are automatically participating in the people's school.

　　孙家庄
  　冬校开课
    【本报高邑讯】在群众冬闲夜长要求进步的呼声下，孙家庄先后建立起男女民学。并提出“自动上学求进步，学习不落别人后”的口号。教员不用选固定的，采用互相学习办法，人人可以当教员，个个都是当学生。谁会啥、谁懂啥、谁就讲啥，根据大家要求，提出了以下的课程：（一）读报，（二）讨论政策法令，（三）学习生产技术（商、农、工、纺、织），（四）学习文化（识字唱歌）。在大家的热情要求下，群众都自动的参加了民校。
