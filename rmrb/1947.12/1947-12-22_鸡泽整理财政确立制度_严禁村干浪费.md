　　【Report from our Jinnan Office on the 20th】After three months of consolidating village finances in Jize, expenses were reduced by more than 9 million yuan. In the past, the work of consolidating village finances was neglected. Sometimes, when consolidation was proposed, it was just a matter of issuing an instruction or calling for thrift, without specific measures or inspections, and the phenomenon of waste in various villages remained the same. In June of this year, the proposal to vigorously consolidate village finances was raised again. First, the root causes of waste were identified, and old accounts and expenses were cleared up. It was learned that the use of funds in the villages lacked a system, expenses were spent haphazardly, and no one was responsible for controlling them. For example, taking travel expenses and cigarette money for meetings, taking money for training, and taking money for wartime service assignments. In short, whenever there was "official business," money had to be spent. In addition, lamp oil and buying snacks, accumulated over time, had to be apportioned, becoming a large expense. In light of this situation, the following methods were researched: With the exception of grain allocated for wartime service assignments, no other apportionments were allowed in the village. Village expenses were to be paid from the local grain levy. Based on the size of the village and the specific circumstances of the expenses, villages with 50 to 100 households were allocated 50 to 250 jin of wheat per month, which was issued to the village first, to be managed and used flexibly by the village itself. District cadres were responsible for inspection, and village cadre meetings were held to compare the size of expenses and evaluate good and bad practices. In this way, the villages dared not waste any more, and from July to September, considerable results were achieved in financial consolidation. For example, Dongying Village, with 374 households, had spent 100,1502 yuan in the past three months, of which 60,453 yuan were improper expenses. After consolidation, the three-month expenses were 24,000 yuan, saving 37,702 yuan compared to the past. County-wide statistics are even more staggering. In the past three months, expenses were 11,217,453 yuan. After consolidation, the three-month expenses were 1,954,057 yuan, saving 9,263,396 yuan. This inspection and calculation has drawn the attention of cadres and the masses to village expenses and strengthened the supervision of the masses. Each month, village cadres report expenses to the masses and file a report with the district once. They also take the village expenses grain issued by the government and invest in business, preparing for the village to be self-sufficient in funds. Villages such as Xiaozhai, Dongshuangta, and Kangshuangta have combined the half-year village expenses they received with the village's flower workshops, oil mills, and cooperatives to carry out sideline production, ensuring self-sufficiency and no apportionments. The first district has invested the village expenses in the Wuguanying Central Cooperative, taking 10 per thousand in profit each month (i.e., 1,000 yuan per 100,000 yuan) as village expenses, preparing for self-sufficiency.

### 鸡泽整理财政确立制度　严禁村干浪费

　　鸡泽整理财政确立制度
  　严禁村干浪费
    【本报冀南二十日电】鸡泽经过整理村财政，三个月时间，村开支节省九百余万元。过去对村财政整理工作是忽视的，有时提出整理，也不过下个指示，号召节俭，没有具体办法，也不检查，各村浪费现象依然如故。今年六月间，特再次提出大力整理村财政。首先找浪费根源，清理旧帐开支；了解到村的用款没制度，乱开支，没人负责掌握。例如开会拿路费、烟钱，受训也拿钱，战勤支差也拿钱，总之“公事”一动就得动款；再加上灯油、买零嘴，日积月累，都要派帐，成了一大笔开支。根据此种情况，随研究出以下办法：村中除战勤支差粮外，其他一概不准派款。村经费由地方粮开支，根据村庄大小及费用具体情况，规定五十户至百户的村，每月开支五十斤至二百五十斤麦子，先发到村，由村自己掌握，机动使用，区干负责检查，并开村干会，比较费用大小，评定好坏。如此，各村多不敢再浪费，由七月至九月，三个月内，整财遂获得相当成绩。如东营村三百七十四户，过去三个月开支十万零一千五百零二元，其不正当开支即占六万零四百五十三元，整理后，三个月开支二万四千元，比过去节俭了三万七千七百零二元。全县统计更为惊人，过去三个月开支一千一百二十一万七千四百五十三元，整理后，三个月开支一百九十五万四千零五十七元，节省了九百二十六万三千三百九十六元。经过这一检查计算，引起了干部群众对村经费开支的注意，加强了群众的监督。各村村干每月向群众报告开支，向区备案一次。并拿政府发给的村经费粮，投资做买卖，准备村款自给。小寨、东双塔、康双塔等村，已将发下的半年村经费结合本村花坊、油坊、合作社进行副业生产，保证做到自给，不派款。一区已将村经费投入吴官营中心合作社，每月按十抽一（即一万抽一千）利，作村经费，准备自给。
