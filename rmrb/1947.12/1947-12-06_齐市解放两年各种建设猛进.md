Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. November 24th marked the second anniversary of the establishment of the democratic government of Qiqihar City, an important town in western Manchuria, and nearly 200,000 people in the city warmly celebrated. In the past two years, the city has made remarkable achievements in supporting the patriotic self-defense war, carrying out democratic movements, and engaging in production and construction. More than 2,000 young people in the city joined the army, and a large number of cars, carts, horses, and stretchers were mobilized to participate in war service. The women of the city were also mobilized to make 53,000 pairs of military shoes and sew 100,000 sets of cotton military uniforms. The masses in the city are vigorously eliminating the remnants of the enemy and puppet regime and feudal forces, and have helped people in other counties arrest more than 200 local bullies and landlords hiding in the city. Fourteen major traitors, bureaucrats, and landlords in the city have been tried by the people, and the political power of various districts and streets is now being further thoroughly transformed. In terms of production and construction, free trade has been implemented, tax rates have been reduced, labor-management relations have been reasonably adjusted, the lives of workers and peasants have been improved, and problems such as electricity and fuel have been guaranteed. The number of legitimate businesses in the city alone has increased from 1,334 to 3,572, and the number of textile households has increased from dozens to more than 7,000. The number of looms has increased from eight to more than 250, improving the lives of nearly 20,000 poor people and raising the social status of women. In agriculture, 60,000 mu of land have been cultivated in the suburbs, and most institutions have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables. This spring, citizens enthusiastically subscribed to 100 million yuan of construction bonds, and repaired and added 27 schools, reading rooms, and other facilities, as well as 20 public works such as the Wangjianglou Children's Sports Field and air-raid shelters. Other achievements include repairing road surfaces, transforming bridges, adding water supply trunk lines, and constructing tap water supply devices, electric lights, and telephones.
