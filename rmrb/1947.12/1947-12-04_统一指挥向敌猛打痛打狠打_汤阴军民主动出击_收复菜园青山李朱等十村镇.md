　　Unified Command Attacks the Enemy Vigorously, Fiercely, and Ruthlessly
  　Tangyin Military and Civilians Take the Initiative to Attack
    Recover Ten Villages and Towns Including Caiyuan, Qingshan, and Lizhu

    [Reported from Yu Bei by this Newspaper] The 306th unit of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the Tangyin Battalion Independent Branch and the armed work teams and militia of various districts, formed a superior force and, under the unified command of the county headquarters, launched a comprehensive attack and a vigorous, fierce, and ruthless offensive against the bandits, "Returning Home Corps," and "Society Troops." From November 12th to November 19th, in a week, we launched several attacks on the enemy, and the enemy stationed in the vast villages were all subjected to the attack and threat of our powerful forces. In total, we annihilated 267 enemy "Returning Home Corps" and "Society Troops" (killing 124 enemy "Returning Home Corps" Dasi Tai "Society Troops" leaders and below, wounding 49 enemy troops, and capturing 94 enemy "Returning Home Corps" and "Society Troops"). We seized three rifles, two curved-handled guns, 136 bullets, and a large number of indigenous weapons such as red-tasseled spears, iron forks, and wooden sticks, as well as four head of livestock, and recovered ten villages and towns, including Caiyuan (the number of enemies annihilated and spoils seized are unknown), Da Qingshan, Xiao Qingshan, Qian Lizhu, Hou Lizhu, Hanzhuang, Buluo, Xiao Song, Yan Shang, and Da Si Tai. We also crushed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' attempt to invade Yigou, with only three of our men lightly wounded.

    After a week of comprehensive attacks, the enemy-us situation in Tangyin began to change. The enemy's morale was generally low, and they were restless day and night, fearing our army's attack. The enemy has changed from primitive, blind, shouting, and intimidating attacks to shrinking back and entering a state of passive defense, building simple fortifications to block village entrances and streets, and began to concentrate on retreating and defending.

    Our morale is high, and we have shifted from defense to taking the initiative to attack the enemy and beginning to liberate villages and towns. (Li Fucang)

　　统一指挥向敌猛打痛打狠打
  　汤阴军民主动出击
    收复菜园青山李朱等十村镇
    【本报豫北讯】解放军三○六部配合汤阴营兵独支及各区武工队、民兵等，组成优势力量，在县指统一指挥下，向土匪“还乡团”“会队”展开全面出击及猛打痛打狠打的攻势。十一月十二日起至十一月十九日一周内，我曾向敌出击数次，敌驻广大村庄均受到我强大力量的打击和威胁。总计我共歼敌“还乡团”、“会队”等二百六十七名、（击毙敌“还乡团”大寺台“会队”队长等以下一百二十四名，敌伤四十九名，俘敌“还乡团”“会队”等九十四名）。缴获步枪三枝，曲把子两枝，子弹一百三十六粒，红缨枪、铁叉、木棍等土武器甚多，牲口四头，收复菜园（歼敌及缴获不明），大青山、小青山、前李朱、后李朱、韩庄、部落、小宋、奄上、大寺台等十个村镇，并粉碎了蒋匪进犯宜沟的企图，我方仅轻伤三名。
    经过一周的全面出击，汤阴敌我情况开始变化，敌人士气普遍低落，日夜不安，深怕我军攻击，敌人由原始盲动、呐喊、威吓进攻已变为缩头缩尾，转入被动挨打状态，修筑简单工事堵村口街道，并开始集中退却防御。
    我方士气高涨，由防御转移而转入主动向敌出击，开始解放村镇。（李复仓）
