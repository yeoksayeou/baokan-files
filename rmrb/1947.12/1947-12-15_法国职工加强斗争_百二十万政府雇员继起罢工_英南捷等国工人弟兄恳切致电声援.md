Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: (Comprehensive Report) After the National Strike Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor's (CGT) negotiations with the Socialist Labor Minister, Meyer, broke down again on the evening of the 7th, it issued an order demanding that strikers intensify their actions, and the French strike movement rapidly expanded. The two-day "warning strike" by the National Federation of Government Employees, numbering 1.2 million, began on the morning of the 8th. Simultaneously, to support the government employees and strike struggles throughout the country, all Paris subway workers and bus workers also began a 48-hour strike on the morning of the 8th. Dockworkers in Tunis, North Africa, also decided to join the strike. According to a declaration issued by the National Strike Committee on the 7th, in Paris alone, 1,000 university professors were on strike, and in some provinces, the number of striking middle school teachers reached 80% of the total. The National Strike Committee's declaration stated that regardless of any measures taken by the government against the strikers, they remain united in the struggle to win their demands and are reviewing their fighting strength, which deserves the highest praise. The declaration particularly pointed out the steadfastness and high level of awareness of miners, dockworkers, and sailors. The committee also paid tribute to the government employees who joined the struggle. The declaration concluded: "The government and entrepreneurs are wrong if they think that poverty can conquer the will of the strikers. Countless pieces of evidence show that the will of those who fight for bread and freedom is unshakeable."

After the breakdown of negotiations between the CGT and Meyer, Meyer continued negotiations with Stone House (one of the general secretaries of the CGT, a Socialist). A Paris reporter commented that this was the government colluding with the reformist minority in the CGT in an attempt to split the strike movement. The reporter also stated that this minority had adopted a two-faced approach from the very beginning of the strike movement: on the one hand, sabotaging the workers' struggle, and on the other hand, pretending to support the workers' and employees' demands for increased wages for fear of becoming "generals without soldiers."

At the same time, the Schumann government's emergency anti-strike bill was passed by a joint vote of the right wing in the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic on the 6th. On the 7th, the French government announced that 1,000 strikers had been arrested throughout France. The violence of the police and the thugs bought by the government also continued. Communist Party headquarters in Vichy and other places were shot at and had hand grenades thrown at them. Conflicts in Algiers, Limoges, and Rouginier, among other cities, were not only occurring between the police and the strikers, but also between the strikers and the scabs bought by the government. Strikers in Rouginier caught some scabs and beat them severely.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: (Comprehensive Report) The working classes of European countries have sent telegrams to support the striking French workers. The British "National Committee of Engineering and Allied Trades Shop Stewards" wrote to the French CGT, stating: "The newspapers of the news trusts are full of slander and rumors, but we despise them! Because of fear of the working class, the British law of 1927 was established; now there is the same fear, resulting in the proposal of severe laws in France restricting the rights of workers. We have abolished that erroneous law of 1927 and believe that you will also abolish it. We stand with you in your struggle for a proper level of wages, and we are fighting against the malicious attacks directed by the news trusts."

The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Trade Unions, representing its one million members and the entire working class of Yugoslavia, telegraphed the French CGT, stating: "The heroic French working class, in its strike movement against low wage policies and high prices, against the enslavement and fascistization of France by the hirelings and agents of American imperialism, is also fighting to defend world peace and to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the French nation. We, the Yugoslav working class, denounce the treacherous actions of the right-wing Socialists headed by Blum (who openly sold France to the capitalist trusts and American imperialism) and are deeply convinced that your struggle to win a happy and fulfilling life for the French workers and all the French people will end in victory."

The telegram from the Standing Committee of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions stated: "This association is watching the struggle of the French working class with deep sympathy. We wish you success in meeting your just demands and express our anger at the measures to suppress the working class, especially the laws restricting trade union and social rights." The Czech Grinn City Trade Union has also proposed that the Czech working class establish a "French Strike Relief Fund."

    法国职工加强斗争
    百二十万政府雇员继起罢工
    英南捷等国工人弟兄恳切致电声援
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：法国总工会全国罢工委员会，七日晚与社会党劳工部长梅耶的谈判再告破裂后，已发出命令，要求罢工者加强行动，法国罢工运动遂急剧扩大。全国政府雇员联盟一百二十万人的两日“警告罢工”，于八日晨开始，同时，为支持政府雇员及全国各地的罢工斗争，全巴黎地下铁道工人及公共汽车工人亦于八日晨开始罢工四十八小时。北非的突尼斯码头工人亦决定参加罢工。据七日发表的全国罢工委员会之宣言称：仅在巴黎一地，罢工的大学教授即达一千名，在各省参加罢工的中学教员，在某些地方达到占总数百分之八十。全国罢委会宣言称：不管政府采取任何反对罢工者的措施，他们仍旧是团结在为争取自己的要求而进行的斗争中，并且检阅着自己的战斗力，这个战斗力值得最高度的赞扬。宣言特别指出矿工、码头工人和海员的坚强性与高度觉悟性。委员会并向走进斗争的政府雇员致敬。宣言结语称：政府和企业家如果认为贫困可以征服罢工者的意志，那就错了。无数的证据说明，为了面包和自由而斗争的人们，其意志是不可动摇的。
    总工会与梅耶谈判破裂后，梅耶乃与石屋（总工会总书记之一，社会党人）继续谈判。巴黎某记者评论此事时称：这是政府勾结总工会中改良主义的少数派，企图分裂罢工运动。该记者并称：这个少数派在罢工运动的最初期就采取了两面派手法：一方面破坏工人的斗争，另方面却因为害怕成为“无兵将军”，装作拥护工人和职员的增资要求。
    与此同时，舒曼政府之紧急反罢工法案已由国民议会及共和国参议院之右派联合票于六日通过。七日法国政府宣布在全法逮捕的罢工者已达一千人。而警察与政府所收买的流氓之暴行，亦在继续。在维希及其他地方的共产党党部，被枪击与投掷手榴弹。阿尔、里摩日及罗金尔等城的冲突，已不仅发生在警察与罢工者之间，而且发生在罢工者与政府收买的工贼之间。罗金尔的罢工者曾将某些工贼捉住痛殴。
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：欧洲各国工人阶级纷纷致电声援法国罢工工人。英国“工程与附属工业车间工人全国委员会”致书法国总工会称：“新闻托拉斯的报纸上满布诽谤与谣言，但是我们蔑视它们！由于对工人阶级的恐惧，因而成立了英国一九二七年的法律；现在也有同样的恐惧，结果在法国提出了严重的限制工人权利的法案。我们已经废除了一九二七年的那一错误法律，相信你们也一定会废除它。在你们争取工资的适当水平之斗争中，我们是与你们站在一起的，而且我们进行着斗争，反对新闻托拉斯们所指使的恶毒攻击。”
    南斯拉夫职工会中央委员会，顷代表其一百万会员与南国全体工人阶级，致电法国总工会称：“英勇的法国工人阶级，为了反对低微工资政策及物价高涨，为了反对美帝国主义的雇庸与代办，对法国的奴役和法西斯化而进行的罢工运动，同时也就为的保卫世界和平，维护法兰西民族独立与主权的斗争。我们，南斯拉夫工人阶级申斥以勃鲁姆（他公开地将法国出卖给资本家托拉斯与美国帝国主义）为首的右翼社会党人的叛卖行动，并深信你们争取法国工人与全体法国人民的美满幸福生活的斗争，将以胜利终结。”
    捷克工会中常会的电文称：“本会正以深切的同情，注视着法国工人阶级的斗争，我们预祝你们的正义要求得到满足，并对镇压工人阶级的措施，特别是限制工会与社会权利的法令表示愤怒。”捷克格林城区工会并已提出建议，要求捷克工人阶级建立“法国罢工救济基金。”
