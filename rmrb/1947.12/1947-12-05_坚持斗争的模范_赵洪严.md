　　A Model of Perseverance in Struggle
　　——Zhao Hongyan
　　Zhao Hongyan, a peasant association chairman from a village in Pingyi County, Lunan, faced a situation in May and June when the enemy’s large forces pressed in, and the county and district armed forces temporarily withdrew. Zhao Hongyan immediately went out day and night to carry out activities. He once used stones to smash three Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to death, captured Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and used the sole of his shoe to scare away Chiang Kai-shek scouts who encountered him. This aroused the jealousy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and local returned landlord militias, who put up wanted posters everywhere, offering rewards for the capture of "Zhao Da Ya" (his nickname).
　　He hid in a five-layer stone cave on the top of Sikaisan Mountain, wearing only a torn sack. When he was freezing during the day, he would go to the entrance of the cave to bask in the sun. At night, he passed through Chiang Kai-shek's blockade, barefoot, to carry out activities at the foot of the mountain. Five days later, he was finally discovered by the returned landlord militia, who surrounded the stone cave and fired more than fifty shots into the cave, forcing him to surrender. Instead, he climbed into the second layer of the stone cave. The enemy brought his wife and ten-year-old child to the front of the cave, ordering them to shout for him to come out. He insisted on not leaving the cave. The enemy then brutally tortured his wife. Because she had just given birth to a child the night before, she was beaten to the point of being half dead, crying in a non-human voice. The ten-year-old child was also terrified and screamed miserably, but Zhao remained steadfast and did not come out. When this plan failed, the enemy used grenades to bomb the stone cave. He climbed into the fifth layer, which could only accommodate one person squatting down. Although the shrapnel did not hit him, the fumes made it difficult to breathe, so he covered his head with his jacket. The corner of his trouser leg was set on fire, so he rubbed the fire out with his leg. The enemy fired eleven grenades but still did not see him come out of the cave, assuming that he had died in the cave, and then withdrew.
　　When he crawled out of the cave after dark, his skin had been scratched in many places by the stones, and his feet were also blackened by the smoke. He quietly climbed to the village and asked for two peanut cakes, and then returned to the top of Sikaisan Mountain. When the peanut cakes were finished, the enemy's "suppression" became even more severe. He thought, "When the Red Army went on the Long March, they ate the soles of their leather shoes. I don't have shoe soles to eat, so I will eat grass roots." So, he went everywhere to dig up Shandiliuzi to eat (Shandiliuzi is a kind of wild grass root, shaped like a sweet potato). Shandiliuzi was hard to swallow dry, so he washed it down with spring water. He also found an elm tree and completely ate the leaves and bark. Finally, he used horse-fly vegetables, wild grape leaves, and other wild vegetables to fill his stomach. After eating for seventeen days, he became constipated, his eyes went black, and it was difficult to hold on. He had to go down the mountain again to find something to eat.
　　But a day later, he was discovered by the returned landlord militia, who gathered six puppet township offices to "suppress" Sikaisan Mountain. He hid in a grassy area on a bare ridge and avoided the enemy's "suppression." Thus, after forty-two days, our county and district armed forces finally returned, and he joined the district work team, becoming the most active and heroic member of the work team.

　　坚持斗争的模范
    ——赵洪严
    鲁南平邑县某村农会长赵洪严，五、六月中，敌大兵压境，县区武装暂时转移，赵即昼夜四出活动，他曾用石头砸死三名蒋匪兵，俘过蒋匪兵，又用鞋底吓退和他遭遇的蒋匪侦察员，引起蒋匪和当地还乡团的嫉恶，到处画像悬赏捉拿“赵大牙。”（他的绰号）
    他隐蔽在四开山顶上一个五层石洞里，身上只披着一条破麻袋，白天冻急了就到洞口晒晒太阳，黑夜通过蒋匪的封锁，赤着脚到山下活动，五天后终被还乡团发觉，将石洞包围，向洞里打了五十多枪，逼他出来投降，他却爬进了第二层石洞，敌人把他的老婆和十岁的小孩带到洞前逼令喊出他来，他坚持不出洞，敌人乃凶暴的拷打他的老婆，她因前一夜才生了小孩，被打得死去活来，哭叫的不成人声，十岁的小孩也被吓得惨叫着，但赵坚定不移仍不出去。敌人此计不成，又用手榴弹轰炸石洞，他就爬进第五层，只能够蹲下一个人，弹片虽然落不到身上，但硝焰逼得难以喘息，他就用褂子包上头。裤腿角被打得着火了，就用腿把火搓灭。敌人打了十一个手榴弹仍然没见他出洞，以为他死在洞里，才退去。
    天黑后，他从洞中爬出来时，身上皮肉已被石头刮烂许多处，脚也熏黑了。他悄悄的爬到庄上要了两个花生饼，又回到四开山顶。花生饼吃完时，敌人的“清剿”也更加严重了，他想红军二万五千里长征时吃皮鞋底，我没有鞋底吃，就吃草根，他就到处扒山滴溜子吃（山滴溜子是一种野草根，形似地瓜）。山滴溜子干吃不下，就用泉水冲着吃。他又找到一棵榆树，把树叶树皮已完全吃光，最后又用马虫菜，野葡萄叶等野菜充饥，吃了十七天后大便结住，眼发黑，已难以支持了，只得再下山去找东西吃。
    但过了一天又被还乡团发现，集中了六个伪乡公所“清剿”四开山。他隐蔽在一个光岭的草地里，避过了敌人的“清剿”。这样前后经过四十二天，终于我县区武装返回，他又参加了区武工队，成了最积极的英勇的武工队员。（新华社华东电稿）
