　　Factories in Licheng County are doing everything possible to improve technology, reform tools, and increase production based on the needs of the masses. During the Hundred-Day Textile Movement, since no one in Licheng knew how to make shuttles, the trade union sent three silversmiths to learn how to make shuttles, and one blacksmith and one carpenter to learn how to make tool. The five people went to Pingshun to learn. The first time they came back, they were not successful enough, so they went to learn again. They returned and opened a shuttle factory. Now eighteen people have learned how to make shuttles. The wood factory of the Third and Fourth District Cooperative created a self-winding and self-weaving loom. A worker in Zhangjiashan created a new spinning wheel that produces four threads at once, but it was not easy to use. Shen Baigou looked at it, found the problem, and after modification, it became very easy to use. Workers from the Fourth District Wood Factory went to the villages to work, helping village workers learn to make machines, and universally reformed double-wheeled spinning wheels. Because a small contract system was implemented, with piecework pay and profit-sharing according to work points, a labor-capital benefit policy was instituted. This changed the rate from ten or so workers making one machine to four or five workers making one machine, and the quality was still not bad. Nancun established a sand-casting factory, sending people to Changzhi to learn twice with relatively successful results. They went from using over a hundred workers to later using three hundred workers, saving one hundred and fifty catties of raw earth. They created a windlass for pouring iron axes and experimented with pouring iron pots, solving a great difficulty for the masses. The Beiliucun Wood Factory implemented a policy of making whatever the masses need, making more of what the masses love, and teaching apprentices what they want to learn. During the Hundred-Day Textile Movement, they taught how to make looms, during the spring plowing season they taught how to make plows, and also taught how to calculate the cubic feet to estimate the weight of lumber for outgoing goods. In the Dongguan Wood Factory, out of sixteen people, only Cheng Zengyun knew how to make saddles, but he kept it a secret and did not pass it on. He returned to Lin County in February, and his nephew told the workers what they looked like. After everyone studied, eight people have now learned how to make saddles. The Nanguan Iron Factory started making shuttle tips. Two people could only make fifty pairs a day, and each was sold for two hundred and forty yuan. Later, after researching a mold, they could make one hundred and twenty pairs a day, and the price was reduced to one hundred and sixty yuan. Previously, wooden axles were used for changing axles, and each wooden axle cost 32,000 yuan. Later, they created durable iron axles, priced at 19,000 yuan. The Militia Factory created reloaded bullets and reloaded landmines, etc.

　　Based on the above situation, if we want to learn and improve, we must raise our awareness, break down conservative ideas of not passing on knowledge, and strengthen worker solidarity and mutual research. There are three methods of learning: one is to learn outside, one is to learn from the masses, and the third is for workers to organize and conduct collective research. This is what must be paid attention to in order to improve and consolidate factories. (Chang Qun)

　　互相学习集体创造提高技术改良工具
    黎城各工厂，根据群众需要，想尽一切办法提高技术改良工具增加产量。当在百日纺织运动中，黎城没人会造＠，职工会派了三个银匠学造＠一个铁匠一个木匠学造＠工具，五人到平顺学习，头次回来不够成功，二次又去学，回来开设了＠厂，现有十八人学会了造＠。三四区联社木工厂，创造了自卷自织的织布机。张家山一个工人创造了新纺车，一齐出四条线，但不好用，申白狗去看以后，找出了毛病，经修改很好用。四区木工厂工人下村做活，帮助村工人学做机子，普遍的改造双轮大纺车，因实行了小包工制，按活计工，以工分红的劳资两利方针，使十几个工做一架机的改成了四五个工就做一架，质量还很不坏。南村创建了翻沙厂，派人到长治学习两次比较成功，由出百十多个工，后来出到三百多，省甘土一百五十斤，创造了倒铁轴风壶儿，试倒铁锅，解决了群众很大困难。北流村木工厂实行了群众用啥就做啥，群众爱啥多做啥，徒弟愿学啥师傅就教啥，百日纺织中教作织布机，春耕教投犁，并教立方尺计算木料轻重出货等。东关木工厂十六人，只有程增云一人会做鞍，但他保守不传人，他二月回林县，他的侄儿给工人说了个样子，大家研究，现有八人学会了做鞍。南关铁工厂开始做梭尖，两人一天才打五十付，每个就卖二百四十元，后来研究出模子，每天就打一百二十付，价格又减成一百六十元。以前换车轴是木头，每个木轴三万二千元，后来创用铁轴耐用，价一万九千元。民兵工厂创造了复装子弹复装地雷等。
    根据以上情况，要想学习提高，必须提高觉悟打破保守不传思想，加强工人团结互相研究，学习方法有三种：一是出外学习，一是向群众学习，第三种是工人组织起来集体研究，这是提高工厂巩固工厂必须注意的。（长群）
