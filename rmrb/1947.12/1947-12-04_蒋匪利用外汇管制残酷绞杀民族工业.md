Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – According to Tianjin press reports: On the 11th of last month, the date stipulated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities for the first "Industry Day," Tianjin's national industrialists and businessmen expressed their indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' brutal rule of destroying national industry and commerce. Lao Duwen, General Manager of the privately-owned Huaxin Cotton Mill, pointed out the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek government used foreign exchange controls to cruelly exploit national industry, saying: "Huaxin, Beiyang, and four other privately-owned cotton mills have been approved to settle foreign exchange for the purchase of more than 8,000 bales of American cotton. The [Chiang Kai-shek] government stipulates that 60 percent of this should be used as 'agency weaving,' which is recovered by the government at a negotiated price. In this way, Huaxin alone will lose 20 billion yuan." Lao pointed out that in addition to "agency spinning," "purchasing," and "exchange," the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' government has now added a joint distribution system to the textile industry. Privately-owned cotton mills are like tailors hired by others, only delivering goods as ordered, and nothing else can be said. Tailors still have a market price, but privately-owned cotton mills only have an official price. Zhu Jisheng, General Manager of Renli Woolen Mill, complained: "The current import and export system is harmful and unprofitable for manufacturers. Last year, Renli's exports sometimes exceeded 100,000 US dollars in a month. As a result, all these foreign exchange earnings were taken away by the government, and now Renli's foreign exchange quota is only 27,000 or 28,000 yuan per quarter for three months, which is less than one-fifth of the required amount of foreign wool; 'and the required dyes cannot be allocated at all. As a result, manufacturers have to spend four or five times the price to buy them." Zhou Shutao, Manager of Qixin Cement Company, said: "Qixin is the largest cement factory in the country, but its current output is only half of what it was before the war. Industry cannot be delayed any longer." Tan Zhiqing, who runs Guangming Vegetable Oil Factory and also engages in import and export trade, said: "Guangming, this small oil factory, is now only operating at one-tenth of its capacity." He pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' exorbitant taxes and levies are the noose around the neck of national industry; "Not to mention the taxes with names, the unnamed ones cost tens of millions of yuan at every turn. How can industry and commerce bear such donations and allocations?" Industrialist Li Zhuchen also said: "The government clamors for industrialization every day, but in reality, it is destroying industrialization."

　　蒋匪利用外汇管制残酷绞杀民族工业
    【新华社陕北二日电】据津报讯：上月十一日为蒋匪当局规定之首届“工业节”，是日津市民族工商业家均对蒋匪摧残民族工商业之暴虐统治表示愤慨。民营华新纱厂总经理劳笃文指出蒋政府利用外汇管制对民族工业实施残酷剥削的事实说：“华新、北洋等四家民营纱厂曾经请准结汇买美棉八千多包。（蒋匪）政府规定其中百分之六十作为‘代织’，按议价由政府收回，如此，华新一厂即须蚀本二百亿元。劳氏指出蒋匪政府对纺织业的编制除‘代纺’‘收购’‘交换’之外，现在又多一个联合配销制。民营纱厂就好象被人雇用的裁缝，只是按货交货，别的就说不上。裁缝还有个市价，而民营纱厂却只有一个官价。仁立呢绒工厂总经理朱继圣诉苦称：“现行的出入口制度对于厂家有百害而无一利。去年仁立一个月出口多的时候，到过十万余美元。这些外汇结果都被政府拿去，而今仁立所得的外汇配额，每季三个月不过二万七、八千元，所买外国羊毛不足需要量五分之一；‘而所需用的染料根本得不到配额。结果厂家只好花四、五倍的大价去买。”启新洋灰公司经理周叔韬称：“启新是国内最大的洋灰厂，目前产量只及战前的二分之一。工业是拖不下去了。”经营光明植物油厂兼营出入口贸易之谭志清说：“光明这个小油厂，现在只开工十分之一。”他指出蒋匪苛捐杂税乃是民族工业的绞绳；“有名目的不必说，无名目的动轧几千万元，这样捐，那样派，工商界如何受得了。”工业家李烛尘也说：“政府天天嚷工业化，而实际是破坏工业化。”
