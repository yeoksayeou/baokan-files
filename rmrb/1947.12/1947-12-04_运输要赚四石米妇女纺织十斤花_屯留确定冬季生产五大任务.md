　　[This paper, Taiyue, 2nd] Tunliu County held a meeting of various heroes and model workers on the 21st of last month, and determined five major tasks for winter production: (1) Mobilize all and part of the female labor force to launch a "Ten Jin of Cotton" weaving campaign. Improve quality, ensuring good carding, spinning, and weaving. (2) Launch a "Four Shi of Rice" transportation campaign, striving for each cart to earn four shi of rice. (3) Learn from Zhang Yingcai's method of combining shift transportation with corvée labor, exporting local products and buying back livestock, striving to increase livestock by 700 head, aiming for one head of livestock for every 50 mu of autumn land, transforming bad livestock into good, and turning those without livestock into those with livestock. (4) Launch a manure accumulation campaign, sweeping more, diligently padding enclosures to accumulate manure and soil, striving for 45 dan of manure per mu of land next year. (5) Accumulate ash and boil saltpeter, completing 1.8 million jin of ash and 70,000 jin of saltpeter. In carrying out winter production, the first thing is to overcome the "half a year of farming, half a year of leisure" mentality of taking a break, and under the new spirit of "one year of farming, two years of hard work," complete our huge task of winter production this year.

　　运输要赚四石米妇女纺织十斤花
    屯留确定冬季生产五大任务
    【本报太岳二日电】屯留于上月二十一日全县各种英雄模范会上，确定冬季生产的五大任务：（一）妇女全半劳力组织起来，展开“十斤花”的纺织运动。提高质量，要做到弹好、纺好、织好。（二）展开“四石米”的运输运动，争取每辆车赚到四石米。（三）要学习张英才等的轮班运输与支差结合的运输办法，输出土货，买回牲口，为增加七百头牲口而努力，争取做到每五十亩秋地一头牲口，使坏牲口变为好的，没有的变为有牲口的。（四）展开积肥运动，要多扫、勤垫圈积粪土，争取明年每亩地上粪四十五担。（五）积灰熬硝，完成一百八十万斤灰、七万斤硝。在进行冬季生产中，首先要克服“半年庄稼半年闲”的歇一歇思想，在“一年庄稼二年闹”的新精神下，完成我们今年冬季生产的巨大任务。
