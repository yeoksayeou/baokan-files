    Taihang Second Special District Loans to Poor and Hired Laborers for Production to Overcome Famine
    Allocates Rice to Support Pingtimg Iron Industry
    [Report from this newspaper, Taihang, 17th] The Second Special District Office and the Second Branch of the Jinnan Bank have recently issued 100 million yuan in winter production loans and 50 million yuan in famine relief loans to strongly support the winter production of the poor and hired laborers and to rescue them from the disaster. The principle for the distribution of these two types of loans is based on the production and famine relief situation of the masses in each county, the severity of the disaster, and the number of victims. The Second Special District Office specifically instructed each county when issuing the loans that they should be used entirely to assist the poor and hired laborers in solving their winter production and famine relief difficulties. In terms of method, the loans should be focused on the poor and hired laborers through the village cooperatives that can organize the masses for production and famine relief. If the cooperatives have not been reformed, the loans should be given directly to the poor and hired laborers. At the same time, through the issuance of this loan, the poor and hired laborers should be mobilized to seriously examine the errors in the previous issuance of all loans and let the masses discuss and correct them. The procedures for issuing loans should be simplified and expedited, and should not be distributed equally. In addition, the Special District Office has allocated 200,000 jin of millet to support the increased production of the Pingtimg iron industry, which will increase the output of iron goods and the income of the masses. Furthermore, it will enrich the content of transportation and solve the problem of the masses' winter production. In order to solve the transportation difficulties of the poor and hired laborers in overcoming the famine, in addition to thoroughly reforming the stores along the transportation lines, each county can extract 200 shi of grain from the local grain to solve the food difficulties of the poor and hired laborers during transportation, reduce excessive consumption during transportation, and avoid being exploited by some people who speculate and raise prices (this grain will be returned after the transportation is completed). In terms of organization and leadership, the Special District Office, the Second Industry and Commerce Branch Bureau, the Cooperative General Society, and Wanxin Company (trading company) jointly organized the "Second District Winter Production and Transportation Liaison Office" to be responsible for organizing and assisting the transportation work in the entire region. One person each from Yuci, Taigu, Shouyang, and Zuoquan participated. The main tasks were to organize the transportation of materials and guide the transportation routes, including transporting materials, organizing return trips, coordinating the material transportation relationships between counties, and reforming the stores along the transportation lines in the region. Stacks were set up in Xingtai and Zanhuang in the First District to coordinate the exchange of materials between the two districts.

    太行二专贷款贫雇生产渡荒
    拨米扶植平定铁业
    【本报太行十七日电】二专署、冀南银行二分行，顷发放冬季生产贷款一万万元、渡荒贷款五千万元，以大力支援贫雇群众冬季生产，抢救灾荒。该两宗贷款分配的原则是：按各县群众生产渡荒情况，灾荒程度及灾民之多少而定，二专署于贷款发放时，特别指示各县，在用途上应完全贷给贫雇，帮助其解决冬季生产渡荒困难。方法上应通过能组织群众生产渡荒的各村合作社，有重点的贷给贫雇群众。合作社没有改造的，则应直接贷给贫雇。同时，通过此次贷款的发放，发动贫雇认真检查以往的一切贷款发放的错误，让群众讨论纠正。发放贷款手续，应力求简便迅速，切勿平均分配。此外，专署又拨出二十万斤小米，扶植平定的铁业增产，一则可增加铁货的产量与群众收益；二则可充实运输的内容，与解决群众冬季生产的出路问题。为解决贫雇群众渡荒运输困难，除彻底改造运输线上的店房外，在一定的线栈，各县可由地方粮内抽出二百石粮，解决贫雇群众运输的粮食困难，减少运输中的过大消耗，免受某些人的投机取巧、抬高市价之苛待（该粮食于运输毕，负责归还）。在组织领导上，专署、工商二分局、合作总社、万新号（贸易公司）共同组织“二分区冬季生产运输联络处”，负责组织与帮助全区运输工作，榆次、太谷、寿阳、左权各抽一人参加，主要任务是组织运输物资及运输路线的指导，包括运输物资、组织回脚、调剂各县物资运输关系、改造本区运输线上的店房等等，并在一分区邢台、赞皇设栈，以调剂两区的物资交流。
