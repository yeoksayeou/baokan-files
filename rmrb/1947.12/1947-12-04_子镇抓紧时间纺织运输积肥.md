　　Zizhen Seizes Time for Spinning, Weaving, Transport, and Manure Accumulation

　　[Our dispatch] Immediately after the end of the autumn harvest, Zizhen promptly engaged in production summaries, putting forward positive production struggle slogans such as: "Make up for the two poor harvests of summer and autumn, fill the holes through production and conservation, let all poor and hired peasants labor, and not worry about spring famine next year," "Overcoming natural disasters depends on labor, not fearing small harvests but fearing inaction, saving carefully to make up for disaster conditions," and organized small-scale cooperation for production. For example, the Shangjie Brigade organized all forty-two male laborers, forty-one female laborers, thirty children, and twenty-eight livestock of the entire team into various workshops for spinning, weaving, transport, and activities like firewood gathering and manure accumulation, with unified work calculation and production according to labor and skill. Production income was uniformly evaluated, and profits were distributed uniformly according to work points based on individual needs. They organized five spinning groups, automatically investing cotton and weaving machines (each machine valued at 8,000 yuan as shares) as capital. Each liang [a unit of weight] of high-quality thread earned 1.25 points, medium-quality thread earned 1 point, and third-quality thread earned 0.7 points; sizing one jin [another unit of weight] of thread earned 1 point, fluffing one jin of thread earned 1.25 points, passing one pair of reeds earned 5 points, reeling one jin of thread earned 1 point; weaving one jin of good cloth earned 5 points, weaving one jin of ordinary cloth earned 4 points, weaving one chi [a unit of length] of quilt cover earned 1 point, weaving one chi of twill earned 1.25 points, weaving one-and-a-half towels earned 1 point (1.2 chi large towel). Two transportation groups and one oil press: each person typically earned 10 points per day, with the highest being 12 points; livestock transporting 10 jin for 30 li round trip earned 1 point; a good livestock at the oil press earned 16 points per day, ordinary livestock earned 15 points, and slightly inferior livestock earned 14.5 points. Due to early starts and late finishes for outside transportation, people and livestock received a subsidy of 100 yuan per day. In addition, there were groups for cotton ginning, selling food, and milling. Recently, they also organized contracted well-digging, all based on the importance of life, level of skill, and evaluated work points. To prepare for agricultural production next year, children combined street sweeping with manure accumulation, earning 3 points per load, and firewood gathering earned 10 points for every 80 jin of general firewood. Various production proceeds, such as cloth, towels, oil cakes, grain, firewood, fertilizer, etc., were all priced, and distributed based on individual needs, regularly implementing a labor-capital split of 80/20 (labor receiving 80%), and currently distributing the first batch of dividends. Currently, under the unified leadership of four small-scale cooperatives, the entire village has organized thirteen spinning groups, four transportation groups, two tofu mills, and nine firewood gathering groups, totaling 1.1 million yuan in capital, combining production with wartime urgency.

　　Editor's note: This kind of comprehensive organization, seizing time to fully carry out winter production, not only engages in sideline industries but also pays attention to firewood gathering and manure accumulation to lay the foundation for agricultural production next year, which is very correct. However, whether the unified leadership and unified profit distribution methods of various production organizations are applicable to the rural environment and truly beneficial to the poor and hired, still needs to be studied.

　　子镇抓紧时间纺织运输积肥
    【本报讯】子镇收耕刚结束即抓紧生产总结，提出：“弥补夏秋两歉收，生产节约补窟窿，贫雇农民都劳动，明年春荒不发愁”，“人胜天灾靠劳动，不怕打少怕不用，省吃俭用补灾情”等积极生产斗争口号，组织小型合作进行生产。比如上街大队，将全队四十二个男劳力，四十一个女劳力，三十个儿童，二十八头牲口，组织了纺织运输各种作坊与打柴积肥等生产活动，统一按活按技术计工生产，生产收入统一评价，根据各人所需统一按工分红。他们组织了五个纺织组，自动入棉花、布机（每架机作八千元股金）作资金，每纺一两上等线作一分二厘五，一两中等线作一分，一两三等线作七厘；浆一斤线作一分，抖一斤线作一分二厘五，过一付杼作五分，轮一斤线作一分；织一斤好布作五分，织一斤平常布作四分，织一尺被面作一分，织一尺斜纹作一分二厘五，织一条半毛巾作一分（尺二大毛巾）。两个运输组，一座油坊，每人一般的每日作十分，最高的十二分，牲口运输往返三十里运十斤作一分，油坊好牲口每日作十六分，平常十五分，差些牲口十四分半，出外运输因起早搭黑，每日人牲口津巾一百元。另外，轧花、卖饭、磨坊各一组。近日并组织包工打水井，均根据生活轻重，技术高低，评工计分。为了准备明年农业生产，儿童结合扫街积肥，每担作三分，割柴的一般柴每八十斤作十分。各种生产所得，如布匹、手巾、油饼、粮食、柴、肥等均作价，根据各人所需，爱分啥分啥，定期实行劳资二八（劳八）来分，现正分第一批红利。现全村在四个小型合作社统一领导下，组织起纺织组十三个，运输组四个，磨豆腐坊两座，割柴组九个，共百一十万元资金，生产战勤相结合来进行。
    　　
    按：此种全面组织抓紧时间全力进行冬季生产，不仅搞副业且注意打柴积肥为明年农业生产打基础，是非常对的，但各种生产组织统一领导统一分红办法是否适用于农村环境及真正对贫雇有利，则尚须研究。（黎城冬季生产小报）
