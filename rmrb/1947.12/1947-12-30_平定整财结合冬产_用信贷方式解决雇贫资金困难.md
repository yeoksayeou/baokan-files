　　Pingding integrates financial rectification with winter production, using credit to solve funding difficulties for hired and poor peasants.
　　[Reported by this newspaper from Pingding] All villages in the Ninth District have combined production and fully launched a re-rectification of financial affairs. In the past half-month, thirteen villages, including Chanquan, have embarked on in-depth construction; the financial rectification movement in twenty-one villages, including Yingzhuang, has also been fully launched; and twelve villages, including Qianhongshui, have now begun rectification. Ten villages, including Zhu Hui, have already rectified over 5.7 million yuan in assets; organizing production can achieve self-sufficiency for the entire year with a surplus. Seven villages, including Yanzhuang, have also rectified over 1 million yuan, achieving self-sufficiency in production. In the direction of organizing production: one method is to use loans, lending the fiscal savings to hired and poor masses, combining it with their own capital to carry out small-scale handicraft workshops and other production. For example, Qigeng, which rectified over 500,000 yuan, has already loaned 160,000 yuan to hired and poor people for opening shops, milling flour, cotton ginning, and weaving. Weaving alone has earned over 40,000 yuan. Another method is to use fiscal savings, combined with the labor and skills of the masses, to engage in labor-capital cooperation for production, achieving a win-win situation where fiscal revenue and the interests of the masses are combined. The main experiences in this phase of financial rectification work are: (1) Combining it with the winter production of the masses, carrying out ideological mobilization in the production organization, with self-reporting and mutual reporting, ensuring that production and financial rectification do not interfere with each other. For example, in the engineering team repairing the main road in Yingzhuang, nearly forty households were brewing self-reporting of finances. (2) Implementing the mass line of relying on hired and poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants in financial rectification work. (3) Resolutely supporting and relying on hired and poor peasants, combining village finances with the labor and skills of the masses, and frequently providing specific guidance and assistance from various production aspects of the masses. This ensures that the masses' production does not suffer losses, which in turn provides insurance for fiscal revenue.

　　平定整财结合冬产
  　用信贷方式解决雇贫资金困难
    【本报平定讯】九区各村已结合生产，全面开展了再次整财运动。半个月来已有潺泉等十三个村，走上深入建设；营庄等二十一个村的整财运动亦已全面开展；前洪水等十二个村现已开始整理。朱会等十个村，已经整出财物折款五百七十余万元；组织生产可以达到全年开支自给有余。沿庄等七个村，亦已整出一百余万元，做到生产自给。在组织生产的方向上：一种是用借贷的方式，将财政存款贷给雇贫群众，结合群众自己的资本，进行小型手工业作坊等生产。如七亘整出的五十多万元，已经将十六万元贷给雇贫，进行开店房、磨面、弹花、纺织等生产，只纺织已经赚了四万多元；另一种是用财政存款，结合群众的劳力与技术，劳资合作进行生产。做到财政收入与照顾群众利益相结合的公私两利。这段整财工作上的主要经验是：（一）结合群众冬季生产，在生产组织上进行思想发动，自报互报，生产整财两不误。如营庄群众在修大路的工程队里，酝酿自报财政的竟有四十多户。（二）整财工作上贯彻依靠雇贫团结中农的群众路线。（三）坚决扶植依靠雇贫农民，用村财与群众的劳力技术相结合，经常从群众各项生产上帮助计划具体指导，这样保证群众生产的不赔，也就给财政收入上保了险。
