    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] The local armed forces of the Yu-West Sub-district, with the force of sweeping away fallen leaves, are suppressing Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits in the Xin'an and Mianchi areas. In the past week, they have annihilated over 500 people, including Wang Kaiji, the puppet county magistrate of Mianchi, and bandit leader Ping Hanchen, and once recovered the county seat of Xin'an. On December 4th, our army surrounded and annihilated the Chiang bandit township teams of Liu Huang Township, Ganquan Township, and Chengguan Township in Zhengcun and Xiaocun, capturing over 60 bandits and killing over 30. On the 6th, we raided the Chiang bandit Temen Township in Miaotou Village, capturing over 120 bandits and killing over 50. In the two battles, a total of one mortar, one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, 150 rifles, and two pistols were seized. At dawn on the 10th, we attacked the Xin'an "Security Regiment" of over 200 Chiang bandits in Wangzhuang, five miles west of Xin'an, and took the opportunity to recover Xin'an (after which we voluntarily withdrew). Wang Kaiji, the puppet county magistrate of Mianchi, gathered Ping Hanchen's troops to operate in Changcun (twenty miles west of Temen), attempting to sneak into Mianchi. However, before the bandits could act, they were surrounded by us on the 11th. After several hours of fierce fighting, most of the Chiang bandits were annihilated, with only a few escaping. A total of over 280 bandits were captured alive, including bandit leader Ping Hanchen, and over 30 were killed, including Wang Kaiji, the puppet county magistrate of Mianchi. One mortar, two heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, over 100 rifles, one grenade launcher, nine short guns, and one animal were seized. After the bandits were annihilated by us, a major scourge was removed for the local people. The masses were overjoyed upon hearing the news. The military district leaders issued a circular on the 12th to commend them. The troops in the area and the new district troops in various parts of Yu-West are engaged in a revolutionary competition to consolidate and expand the area, ensuring the connection between the north bank of the Yellow River and the Yu-West area.
