    The family meetings in Liulizhuang and Niutun villages, Dong'a County, are being conducted well, with villagers voluntarily enlisting and every family rejoicing. The masses in Liulizhuang proposed achieving "three approvals" (self-approval, parental approval, and wife's approval). Each family held family meetings, encouraging each other and resolving ideological issues. When Xu Shixiu convened a family meeting, his elder brother and sister-in-law agreed to his enlistment. His elder brother stated that the family's work did not need others' help and that he would fully bear the responsibility. His parents also said, "We have been liberated, with food and clothing. Enlisting to fight Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest act of filial piety!" His wife, Zhang Fangru, who is a women's committee member, also said, "The whole family agrees with your enlistment. I will be a wife seeing her husband off to the district meeting tomorrow, and the whole family will strive to be a model family."
    Self-defense team member Chen Changli struggled with his thoughts for three days. "Should I stay home and guard my wife and children? Or should I enlist and fight the Chiang bandits? If I just stay home, when the Chiang bandits come (Liulizhuang is still separated from Chiang bandit forces across the river), the children and adults won't be able to run, so won't we just be waiting to die?! Damn it, I must enlist to overthrow Chiang!" After he figured this out, he mobilized his wife, but his wife said, "I see you only talking about going, but I can't leave the children, how will we live? If you leave, I'll leave too!" Later, Changli explained to her, "If you just guard the house, think about when the Third Detachment (puppet troops) was here, we had nothing to eat or burn, and we just went to sleep in the lowlands. Won't it be the same if Chiang's bandits come? The crops in the villages east of the river were all taken by Chiang's bandits, young women were raped, and children were killed, aren't you thinking clearly!" Finally, his wife also resolved her ideological issues and agreed to his going. Enlistment in the whole village has become everyone's business, and now forty-seven people have voluntarily enlisted with their families' consent.
    After returning to the village from signing up in the district, Niutun peasant representative Xu Jinping thought about whether his wife and children would agree to his willingness to enlist. So, he convened a family meeting for everyone to discuss. He started by chatting about daily life: "Honey, think about how much suffering we've endured in our lives! When I was seventeen, because there was nothing to eat at home, I went to Guandong. When I worked in Dalian, I only drank a bowl of bean cake soup for three days. When I came home, I still couldn't find enough to eat. No one on the street looked up to us!" His wife said, "In the past, the poor were worse off than dogs! Back then, no one would even talk to us, afraid we would ask to borrow something." The couple were speechless with sadness as they recalled the suffering they had endured in the past. Jinping said, "It was the Eighth Route Army who led us to turn over and be liberated. We divided the fruits of victory and planted nine mu of land. Isn't life getting better day by day? But the Chiang bandits have not yet been defeated. No, I must enlist to protect the lives and rice bowls of our adults and children!" The children also said, "In the autumn, we are never home, and there's also our eighty-year-old grandma, who can't even walk. We had to pull her out to run away. Wasn't it the 'Homecoming Corps' bastards who caused all that suffering!" Finally, his wife and children agreed to his enlistment, which made Xu Jinping extremely happy.
    After Xu Jinping obtained his family's consent to enlist, the whole village took him as an example and launched family meetings, starting with chatting about daily life. The next day, four people, including Wei Fubin, signed up with their families' consent. Now, influenced by Liulizhuang and Niutun, nearby villages are also launching family meetings to ensure that the whole family agrees before enlisting.

    六里庄、牛屯群众自觉参军
    家庭会议细商量
    人人想通才报名
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】东阿六里庄、牛屯两村家庭会议开得好，参军人人自觉家家欢喜。六里庄群众提出要做到三通（自己通、爹娘通、老婆通），每家开家庭会议，互相鼓励，打通思想，许士修召集全家开家庭会时，哥哥嫂嫂都同意他参军，哥哥表示家里活不用别人照顾，自己完全负担，父母亲也说：“翻身了有吃有穿啦，参军去打老蒋算行了大孝！”他老婆张方如，是妇女委员，也说：“你参军去，全家都同意，明天到区开会，我做个妻子送郎，全家都要争个模范”。自卫队员陈长立作了三天的思想斗争“是在家守着妻子老小呢？还是参军打蒋贼呢？要光在家，蒋匪来了（按六里庄隔河还驻有蒋匪），孩子大人跑不动，不等死吗？！妈的，非参军倒蒋不行。”他想通之后，就动员他老婆，但他老婆说：“看你光说去，小孩又不能离手，咱的日子怎过呀？你走我也走！”后来，长立对她解释说：“你光守家，你想想三支队（伪军）在这里时，弄的没吃没烧，光往洼地里去睡觉，蒋匪过来不一样吗？象河东的庄稼都叫蒋匪拉光了，青年妇女被奸淫啦，小孩也打死，你脑子老不开！”终于，他老婆也打通了思想，同意他去。全村参军已形成每家人的事，现已有四十七人经家庭同意自觉自愿参军。牛屯农民代表徐金平，在区里报名回村后，想到自己愿意参军，但是家里老婆小孩是否同意呢？便召开家庭会议，大家商量。他先从拉家常说起：“妮他娘，您想想咱这一辈子受多少罪呀？我十七岁因家没啥吃，就下关东，在大连做工时，三天只喝了一茶碗豆饼汤，家来时也弄不上吃，街上谁瞧起咱！”他老婆说：“过去人穷三分不如狗！那时谁给咱说句话，怕咱同他借东西。”他两口子想起过去受的苦，都难过的说不上话来，金平说：“是八路军来领导咱们翻了身，咱分了果实种了九亩地，日子不是才一天一天的好起来了吗？可是蒋贼还未打倒，不行，我得去参军，保住咱大人孩子的命和饭碗！”孩子也说：“秋天咱天天不在家，还有俺八十岁的老奶奶，走也走不动，牵着俺往外跑，受那些罪还不是‘还乡团’王八蛋闹的吗！”最后，老婆孩子都同意他参军，喜的徐金平了不得。徐金平得家庭同意参军后，全村以他为榜样，展开家庭会议，先从家常拉起，第二天即有魏福彬等四人，经家庭同意报名。现在附近村庄，在六里庄、牛屯的影响下，纷纷展开家庭会议，做到全家同意才报名参军。
