    Changzi Baodian Market
    Fully Serves Winter Production
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 14th] Changzi is vigorously organizing the transportation of cotton to ensure a steady supply of raw materials for textiles. The Baodian market is fully serving winter production. Since the launch of winter production in Changzi, textile women in various areas have reported that raw materials are difficult to obtain and have urgently requested a solution. For example, in the Fifth District, there are over 10,000 textile women, each requiring ten jin of cotton to spin, necessitating a supply of 100,000 jin of cotton. However, the entire county does not produce cotton. If this problem is not resolved promptly, the textile movement will be difficult to advance. The leadership is currently vigorously organizing the transportation of 100,000 jin of cotton, organizing floating capital, combining labor, and purchasing 50,000 jin of cotton from cotton-producing areas. The trading company is responsible for supplying 20,000 jin, and Baodian merchants are mobilized to purchase 30,000 jin. Secondly, on the current basis of textile production, textile technology will be improved and textile tools will be transformed. The county cooperative has expanded the textile training center, training 136 textile women to learn the flying shuttle and accelerated spinning wheel. The entire county has purchased 68 flying shuttles and 136 accelerated spinning wheels. At present, women in Baodian, Xiren Village, and other villages have secured a solution to the problem of textile raw materials. Baodian Town, the largest commercial town in the county, is dedicated to serving the winter production of the masses. Business firms have pooled funds to purchase 30,000 jin of cotton for textile women and sell it to them at low prices. The town's business association has opened a trading and transportation center to facilitate the transportation and trading of the masses, transforming the former six measuring shops into grain exchanges. During the winter transportation season, the thirteen hotels guarantee reasonable prices, high-quality goods, and attentive service to farmers staying in the hotels, reducing the expenses of transporting farmers and maintaining their health. In order to guide merchants in exporting local products from the interior and absorbing foreign cotton, the trading company announces economic information from various regions on the public blackboard every day.
