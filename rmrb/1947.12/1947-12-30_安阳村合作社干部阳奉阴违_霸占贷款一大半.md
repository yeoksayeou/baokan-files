　　Anyang Village Cooperative Cadres Obey in Public but Oppose in Private
  　Seizing More Than Half of the Loans

　　[Report from this newspaper in Pingshun] After repeated and thorough inspections, it was discovered that the Anyang Village Cooperative in the Seventh District was occupying winter loans. After the problem was discovered, it was promptly corrected and the loans were quickly transferred to hired and poor peasants for winter production. The village had a total of 350,000 yuan in old and new loans, but only 100,580 yuan actually reached the hands of the masses. After deducting the 100,000 yuan in feng gong loans from the cooperative, there was still 144,200 yuan, which was entirely kept by the cooperative. Thus, the cooperative occupied 244,200 yuan of winter loans, accounting for 69.7 percent of the loans. At first, this serious problem was not discovered because: 1. There was a lack of detailed and thorough inspection. We only superficially asked the cooperative cadres, and they said, "It's all been loaned out!" We thought there was no problem and did not investigate further in detail. 2. The situation was misjudged. Because we saw news in the Xinhua Daily and the county production gazette that "Anyang's loan achievements are amazing," saying that the village's loans follow the class line, with hired and poor peasants discussing who should and should not get loans (who wrote this稿子? Why was it written this way? Should be publicly reviewed - Editor), we thought that Anyang's loans probably didn't have much of a problem. This was the wrong assessment we made before arriving in the village. Once we arrived in the village, we saw that all 26 loan households were hired and poor peasants, and our thinking became even more麻痹, thinking that "Anyang's loans are just good!" But the masses who lacked capital in production, especially hired and poor peasants, were reaching out to us asking for a solution. For example, someone said during the Li Renhu group discussion: "We want to生产吧, but where is the capital? If we sell grain, we're afraid of learning from Zhang Laihe. We sell the rice and earn the money, but the money is spent零花完, and we don't buy rice back, causing a two-pronged delay." At that time, we supported the hired and poor peasants, saying not to worry, the cooperative will provide loans to anyone who doesn't have capital. The cooperative cadres said there were no funds left, and even the cooperative didn't have any. At this time, we began to suspect: even with the new loans of more than 100,000 yuan, why were so few loans given out, and then there was nothing left? Therefore, we and political director Cui Fubao together checked the cooperative in more detail, using methods such as accounting追根, and finally found out the truth of the cooperative's deception. After the problem was discovered, the cooperative cadres even adopted a resistant attitude, using the excuse that: "The masses owe the cooperative more than 200,000 yuan, and more than 30,000 yuan of the loans were borrowed by the masses for supporting the army. Most of the借、欠款 are also from hired and poor peasants. Now that they want loans, we haven't collected the debts from the masses, because we're afraid the masses don't have money and have to sell grain, so it's better not to lend or collect." These improper sophistries, which completely contradicted the actual interests of the masses, were severely corrected. It was then proposed that loans are to support winter production and solve the difficulties of hired and poor peasants without capital, not to support the cooperative. The cooperative should immediately transfer the loans to the masses. Collecting debts cannot be mixed with loans, and it is even more wrong to arbitrarily lend the loans to the masses to support the army. Even when collecting debts, it should start from organizing and supporting the masses' production. After research, the cooperative cadres clarified in their thinking that the cooperative's occupation of loans was a mistake for the masses' production and made a review at a meeting of more than 30 hired and poor peasants on the 18th, saying: "This is because we did not wholeheartedly support the masses' winter production. In the future, we must resolutely solve the capital difficulties for the masses." (Is the ideological understanding clear? Does this solve the problem? Both are worth noting - Editor) On the spot, five people, including Cui Fubao, were elected to form a hired and poor peasant loan inspection committee to control the target and use of the entire loan. Subsequently, 12 households, including hired and poor peasant Hou Dongze, borrowed more than 70,000 yuan, and loans are still being made one after another.

　　安阳村合作社干部阳奉阴违
  　霸占贷款一大半
    【本报平顺讯】七区安阳村，经过反复深入的检查，发现合作社占用冬季贷款。查出后及时纠正，迅速转给雇贫投入冬季生产中。该村共新旧贷款卅五万元，而实际贷到群众手里的仅有十万零五千八百元，除去合作社风弓贷款十万元，还有十四万四千二百元，完全在合作社放着。这样合作社即占用冬贷廿四万四千二百元，占贷款的百分之六十九点七。开始，对这一严重问题并没有发现，因为：一、缺乏详细而周密的检查，只是粗浅的问了一下合作社干部，他们说：“都贷出去了！”我们以为没有问题了，不去详细深究。二、估计情况错误。因为在新华日报及县生产小报上，看到“安阳贷款成绩惊人”的消息，说该村贷款走阶级路线，雇贫讨论谁该贷谁不该贷等问题（什么人写的这个稿子？为什么这样写？应当公开检讨——编者），我们想，安阳贷款大概是没有多大问题了。这是未到该村前，即做了这样错误的估计。一到该村，又见二十六户贷款户均属雇贫，思想上更加麻痹，以为“安阳贷款就是不孬”！但生产中缺资本的群众，特别是雇贫，却在伸出手来向我们要求解决，如李仁虎组讨论时有人说：“咱到想生产吧，本钱在那里啦？如果粜粮食，又怕学了张来和，米卖了钱也赚了，可是钱也零花完了，米也没有买回来，闹个两耽搁”。当时我们给雇贫撑腰，说不怕，谁没本钱合作社管贷。合作社干部就说没款了，就连合作社也是没有。这时我们开始怀疑：光新贷款就有十来万，为啥贷出这样少就没有了呢？于是，和政治主任崔富保一同到合作社再详细的检查，用算帐追根等方法，终于找出了合作社的欺骗真象。问题发现后，合作社干部竟采取抵抗态度，借口说：“群众欠合作社帐二十余万元，贷款内又借给群众拥军洋三万余元，借、欠款的大部又是雇贫，现在要贷款，就没有向群众收欠帐，怕群众手里没钱，就得粜粮食，这就不如不贷不收。另外，也不是合作社不给群众贷，而是群众怕出利不贷”。这些和群众实际利益完全相违背的不正当狡辩，受到严厉的纠正，于是提出，贷款是扶植冬季生产，解决雇贫没资本的困难，不是扶植合作社，合作社应立即把贷款转给群众，收欠帐不能与贷款混为一谈，任意把贷款借给群众拥军更不对，即使收欠帐也应从组织与扶植群众生产入手。经过研究，合作社干部在思想上明确合作社占用贷款有误群众生产，并在十八日三十余雇贫会上做检讨说：“这是没全心全意扶植群众冬季生产，今后要坚决为群众解决资本困难”。（是不是从思想上认清楚了？这样是不是解决问题？都还值得注意——编者）当场选出崔富保等五人，组成雇贫检查贷款委员会，掌握整个贷款的对象及用途等。随即有雇贫侯东则等十二户贷款七万余元，现还在陆续贷。　　　　　　（春喜、招喜）
