Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji, a communist base area in northern China] 20th – Comrade Liu Zheng, a regimental chief of staff in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, possesses a strong overall perspective. During the Qingfengdian campaign to annihilate the enemy, he cooperated with friendly forces on several occasions, and stepped forward to lead his troops to save the critical situation when difficulties arose. When disputes arose over captured spoils, he patiently educated his subordinates to be tolerant. During the battle to attack Beihe Village, Comrade Liu Zheng led his troops to occupy the enemy's front line and repelled three enemy counterattacks. At this time, a battalion of a friendly army was suffering from an enemy counter-assault, and the situation was extremely serious. Comrade Liu Zheng disregarded everything and immediately led the Second Battalion to launch a fierce attack on the enemy, relieving the friendly army's crisis. When the enemy gathered to break out of the encirclement, the situation was extremely unfavorable to us. At this time, Comrade Liu Zheng took the initiative to find the chief of staff of the friendly army to discuss and reorganize a strong force to launch a general attack on the enemy, who could not resist and fled. When the final battle to annihilate the enemy in Southwest He was tense, Comrade Liu Zheng took the initiative to contact a regiment from a friendly army brigade. Two battalions of that regiment remained behind because the situation ahead was unclear and the regimental commander had not yet arrived. Comrade Liu Zheng found those two battalion commanders and told them in detail about the enemy and our situation, the direction of the troops' attack, their positions, and tasks, and directed them to cooperate with his troops to quickly encircle and annihilate the enemy. When it came to finally resolving the enemy's headquarters, the task of concentrating forces and firepower for the attack was heavier. Comrade Liu Zheng ordered his team to take the main attack and asked the friendly army to act as the second echelon, precisely organizing the firepower. At the end of the battle, a friendly army unit took four of the 60 mortars they had captured. When the comrades below wanted to chase after them, Liu immediately explained to his troops: "We are all the people's army, and whoever takes them will use them to fight the enemy. For the sake of our army's unity, it is glorious to give way to our comrades." After his explanation, everyone had no objection.

　　整体观念的模范
  　刘征同志在清风店作战中与友军配合歼敌不争缴获
    【新华社晋察冀二十日电】解放军某部团参谋长刘征同志具有坚强整体观念。清风店歼敌中，几次配合友军作战，困难时挺身率部挽救危局。缴获发生纠纷时，耐心教育部下忍让。当攻击北合村战斗中，刘征同志率部占领了敌人前沿，并打退敌人三次反冲锋。此时友军某部一营正遭敌反突击，情况至为严重，刘征同志不顾一切，立即率领二营向敌猛攻，解除了友军危境。当敌集结反突围时，情况对我极端不利，此时刘征同志自动找到友军参谋长商量，重新组成强大兵力，向敌发动总攻，敌不支逃窜。西南合最后歼敌战斗正紧张时，刘征同志主动联络友军某旅一个团，该团两个营因前面情况不明，团指挥员又未上来，留在后面，刘征同志找到那二个营长并将敌我情况、部队进攻方向、位置、任务详细告诉他们，并指挥他们配合自己部队迅速将敌包围歼灭。到最后解决敌军部时，兵力火力集结攻击任务较重，刘同志即令自己团队主攻，要友军做第二梯队，精密组织了火力。战斗结束时，一个友军部队将他们缴到的六○炮拿去四门，下面同志要追，刘即向自己部队解释说：“都是人民的军队，谁拿去也是打敌人，为了我军团结，给自己同志让步是光荣的。”经他解释后，大家都没有意见了。
