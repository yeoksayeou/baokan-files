　　【Jinan, Hebei, 30th dispatch from this newspaper】The successful experimental rice cultivation in the waterlogged depression of Dongpan Village, Fifth District, Qinghe, yielded a harvest per mu equivalent to planting five mu of sorghum. This village is the lowest-lying in the entire county, historically known as Lotus Pond. It has been flooded by river and rain for six consecutive years, completely submerging late seedlings. They could only harvest a little red sorghum, which was not enough to feed most farmers in the village. Last year, poor farmer Pan Weifan bought half a jin of rice seeds at the market and tried planting three fen, resulting in a harvest of forty-two jin. Seeing the high yield from rice cultivation, Pan Yujing and Pan Zhihan jointly planted four mu this year, harvesting over nine hundred jin in total. Each jin yielded twelve liang of clean rice, averaging one hundred and sixty-nine jin of clean rice per mu. If sorghum were planted, the best yield would be two hundred jin per mu, with each jin worth only one hundred yuan. Calculated this way, the yield of rice per mu is equivalent to more than five mu of sorghum. The villagers said one after another, "We will plant rice next year."

　　东潘庄积水洼地试种稻子成功
    【本报冀南卅日电】清河五区东潘庄积水洼试验种稻成功，每亩收成顶种五亩高粱。该村是全县最洼的村，古名莲花池。近遭河水和雨水连淹六年，晚苗一概淹没，光能收点红高粱，全村多数农民不够吃。贫民潘维凡去年在集上买了半斤稻子，试构了三分，结果收了四十二斤。本村潘玉敬看到种稻收获大，今年遂与潘之汉伙种了四亩；共收了九百多斤，每斤出净米十二两，平均每亩合净米一百六十九斤。若种高粱，每亩最好能收二百斤，每斤只合一百元。经这样一算，每亩稻子的收成能顶五亩多高粱。该村群众纷纷说：“明年要种稻。”
