Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th -- In November, the military and civilians in various parts of Central China crushed the desperate "mopping-up" operations by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits against our Lianshui area, the Jingjiang and Taixing (Cheng) Huangqiao southern areas of central Jiangsu, and the Nantong and Haimen areas. Summary of battle results: a total of 2,392 bandits and puppet troops were captured, including Jiang Yongkui, acting county magistrate of Siyang County, Chu Chenghuang, head of the Public Security Bureau, and Sun Miao, deputy commander of the Security Corps; 1,140 bandits were killed or wounded, including Zhang Jingbo, the first battalion commander of the Siyang County Security Corps; 88 light and heavy machine guns, 6 Thompson submachine guns, 3 60mm mortars, 12 small cannons and grenade launchers, and 1,300 long and short guns were seized; 4 trucks were destroyed; and more than 30 important towns were captured, including Siyang County in northern Jiangsu, Gaoliu Town on the Shu(yang)-Xin(anzhen) line, and Liuqiao, 30 miles north of Nantong city.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 15th -- Frontline reporter Dai Tao reported the process of capturing alive Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Colonel Regiment Commander He Junzhang in the Li(bao)-@(cha) line battle: On the morning of the 3rd, after a round of intensive artillery fire by the People's Liberation Army on the Xiaoweizi of the 437th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Libao, the assault troops surged in from all directions. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Regiment Commander He Junzhang had changed into a soldier's uniform and crawled out of a dugout in panic, mixing with a group of soldiers scurrying around. When Wu Zhulin, a platoon leader of our unit, scanned He Junzhang, his face changed drastically. He stood up and said tremblingly, "I am the regiment commander," and introduced the person next to him, saying, "This is the deputy regiment commander." Platoon Leader Wu ordered him to gather the two or three hundred scattered soldiers, and he immediately shouted, "Come on, gather and surrender your guns!" But none of the soldiers obeyed him anymore, and they still surrendered their guns in a disorderly manner. He had no choice but to apologize to Platoon Leader Wu with a sigh. Wu then asked him, "Where are the mortar parts?" He quickly said, "Follow me." He walked to a small house, and a person in plain clothes walked up to him. Wu asked, "Who is it?" The answer was, "It's a civilian." He Junzhang then persuaded him, "Machine gun company commander, don't pretend, everyone has surrendered." The company commander then confessed in fear and found the mortar parts. Afterwards, He Junzhang followed Platoon Leader Wu very obediently, and suddenly took out a pistol: "This is the last weapon, give it to you!"

    华中地武十一月份战果
    歼匪三千五百
    【新华社华东十五日电】十一月份华中各地军民粉碎蒋匪对我涟水地区、苏中靖江、泰兴（城）黄桥南地区及南通、海门地区之挣扎性的“扫荡”。综合战果：计俘匪伪泗县代理县长江永奎、公安局长储城黄、保安总队副孙淼以下二千三百九十二名，毙伤匪泗县保安第一大队长张镜波以下一千一百四十名，缴轻重机枪八十八挺，汤姆式六挺，六零炮三门，小炮掷弹筒十二个，长短枪一千三百枝，毁卡车四辆，攻克淮北之泗县城，沭（阳）新（安镇）线之高流镇及南通城北三十里之刘桥等重要城镇三十余处。
    【新华社华东前线十五日电】前线记者戴陶报导李（堡）＠（茶）线战役中活捉蒋匪上校团长何军章经过称：三日上午，解放军对李堡蒋匪四三七团小圩子一阵密集炮击后，突击部队四面八方涌了进去。蒋匪团长何军章已换了一身士兵服，惊惶失措地从地洞里爬出，混在一群乱窜的士兵中。当我某部排长吴竹林搜索的目光扫过何军章时，他脸色骤变，站出来发抖地说：“我是团长”，并介绍在旁的一位说：“这是副团长”。吴排长命他下令集合这两三百个杂乱的士兵，他立刻高喊：“来呀，集合缴枪。”可是没有一个士兵再服从他，依旧各自杂乱地交枪。他只好向吴排长抱歉的叹了口气。吴又问他：“小炮零件呢”，他连忙说：“跟我来。”走到一处小房子里，迎面走出一个穿便衣的人，吴问：“是谁？”回答：“是老百姓。”何军章就劝他道：“机炮连长不要装腔啦，大家都投降了。”那个连长也就惶恐地俯首承认，并找出小炮零件。以后何军章很贴服的跟着吴排长，忽然又摸出一支手枪：“这是最后的武器，也给你吧！”
