　　Xinhua News Agency, Hubei, Henan and Anhui Front, 24th. Over 7,000 newly liberated soldiers who were liberated during the Gaoshanpu Campaign have joined the People's Liberation Army and held enlistment ceremonies in the garrisons of various units, swearing to serve the people. They were warmly welcomed when they were assigned to various companies. Each platoon and squad held get-togethers and seminars to introduce the PLA's policies, democratic system, and company life to the new soldiers. The veteran soldiers also pooled their money to buy wine, peanuts, and other food to warmly entertain them. In this warm and convivial atmosphere, most of the newly liberated soldiers were moved to tears. Liu Yucheng said, "I only regret that I came late!"
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th. A large number of prisoners have recently been released in Binhai. Among the 2,574 enemy and puppet personnel and "Home Return Corps" members captured alive in the battles west of the Shu River last month and the capture of the Xutang Railway Station on the Longhai Railway, the democratic government has identified the seriousness of their crimes through the masses. Except for 14 people, including the puppet town head Ma Shigui and the Chiang Kai-shek special agent landlord Shao Liwen, who were publicly tried and executed for their heinous crimes, more than 1,760 people have now been released. In addition, 171 people voluntarily requested to join our army. Those released prisoners whose families are in the liberated areas and who are poor peasants or farm laborers are allocated land and floating property equal to that of other poor peasants and farm laborers by the local farmers' associations. The released personnel have all expressed their determination to atone for their crimes in the future. Inspired by this lenient policy of our democratic government, 275 enemy and puppet personnel in Hongrui District, Linyi, have voluntarily returned.
