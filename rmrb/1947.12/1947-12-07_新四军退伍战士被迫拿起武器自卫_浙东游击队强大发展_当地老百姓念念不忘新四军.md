Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: The "Shi Yu Wen" magazine published in Shanghai on September 26th carried a dispatch from Kuaiji, Zhejiang, stating: The rural areas in the KMT-controlled areas are undergoing drastic changes. The Zhejiang East People's Guerrilla Force, which has won the heartfelt support of the people, is growing stronger day by day. In late 1945, many soldiers who did not retreat with the Third and Fifth Detachments of the New Fourth Army (locally known as the Sanbei troops) and the Jin (Hua) Xiao (Shan) People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army (known as the Little Sanbei by the people), after returning to their hometowns as veterans and finding it impossible to survive, have now taken up arms again. "In the past year, the Communist army in the Siming Mountains has continued to expand, and even the Little Sanbei has made a comeback in the Kuaiji Mountains." The author of the dispatch described the farmers' political consciousness as greatly improved, saying: "Now the villagers are different from ten years ago. When they see me, a scholar, returning to my hometown, they all like to run over and inquire: 'How is the civil war going?' 'Will the Communist Party soon gain power?'" The dispatch describes that the farmers were tempered by the extreme poverty and misery under the rule of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang in the past. The people often say: "The new (enemy puppet) county government is a bunch of bastards, and the old (Kuomintang) county government is also a bunch of bastards." Under their rule, they forced rent, forced levies, conscripted laborers, and robbed and burned houses, so that the people "couldn't even eat chaff and fern root in peace." Although the New Fourth Army withdrew from Zhejiang, it is forever fresh in the memories of the people. When chatting, they often mention it, because in the areas liberated by the Sanbei and Little Sanbei, "land was distributed," and they did not commit the slightest offense against the people, and their combat was well-planned, "completely like Zhuge Liang's tactics." The dispatch stated that although the KMT established two "Pacification Headquarters" in the Siming Mountains and Kuaiji Mountains in July this year, launching attacks on the people's armed forces, the people's armed forces are still growing stronger day by day. The reason is that the people support them, believing that only they "follow the people" and "will gain power." The people have joined the people's armed forces one after another, "'Today it is rumored that four people from Village A went up the mountain to join, and tomorrow it is certain that seven people have become 'Communists'," and "the Little Sanbei (people's armed forces) have declared that they will organize the Kuaiji Mountain People's Self-Defense Force." The people's armed forces are vigorously launching anti-pacification work, "They have been advancing to the vicinity of the Pacification Headquarters. The automobile roads and telephone lines are destroyed before they are even repaired, and slogans are posted all along the utility poles."

　　新四军退伍战士被迫拿起武器自卫
    浙东游击队强大发展
    当地老百姓念念不忘新四军
    【新华社陕北五日电】九月二十六日在上海出版的“时与文”杂志载浙江会稽通讯称：蒋管区农村在剧变中。获得人民衷心拥护的浙东人民游击队正在日益壮大，一九四五年底，许多未随新四军三、五支队（当地老百姓称之为三北部队）及金（华）萧（山）人民抗敌自卫军（老百姓称为小三北）撤退的战士，在退伍返乡后，因为存身不得，现在又拿起了武器。“近一年来，四明山区的共军不断扩大，连会稽山区也有小三北卷土重来了。”该通讯作者描述农民政治觉悟已大为提高称：“现在乡下人已和十年前不同，看见我这个读书人回乡，都爱跑来打听：‘内战打得怎样了？’‘共产党快得天下吧？’通讯描述农民是在过去敌伪及国民党统治下，贫穷与悲惨得无以复加的苦难中锻炼出来的，老百姓常说：‘新（敌伪）县府是混蛋，旧（国民党）县府也是混蛋，’在他们的统治下，逼租逼款，拉丁抓夫，抢劫烧房子，老百姓‘连秕糠和蕨粉都吃不安稳’。而新四军虽自浙江撤退，他们在老百姓记忆中永远是新鲜的，聊天的时候老提到它，因为在三北和小三北解放的地区中‘曾分过土地’，并且对老百姓秋毫无犯，作战有计谋，‘完全是诸葛亮的一套。’通讯称：虽然自今年七月间蒋方成立了四明山区及会稽山区两个‘绥靖指挥部’，向人民武装进攻，但人民武装仍日益壮大，原因就是老百姓都拥护他们，认为只有他们是‘跟着老百姓走’，‘会得天下’的。老百姓纷纷加入人民武装，‘今天传说甲村有四个人上山去参加了，明天确确实实有七个人当了‘共产’”，而且“小三北（人民武装）方面已声称将组织会稽山区人民自卫队”。人民武装正在猛烈展开反绥靖工作，“他们一直挺进到绥靖指挥部附近。汽车路与电话线还没有修好就遭破坏，沿路电线杆被贴满标语。”
