　　Taihang Third Administrative Office
　　Calls for Inspection of Winter Production, Organizing the Masses to Collect Firewood and Accumulate Manure
　　[Our Taihang News] The Third Administrative Office, based on the winter production campaign in the region, proposed further delving into the poor peasant class, inspecting and resolving the difficulties in their production. The Administrative Office, based on the December 13th report from the Changzhi United Office, stated that in the first stage of winter production in Guancun, District One, starting with solving the difficulties of the poor peasants, relying on the backbone of the poor peasants, and leading the broad middle peasants, played a promoting role in carrying out winter production and achieved significant results. However, after detailed inspection of the entire poor peasant class, it was found that many households still have many difficulties. Some households have livestock but no vehicles for transportation, and some households want to do business but have no capital. Therefore, the Third Administrative Office specifically proposed to the cadres of counties, districts, and villages: 1. Quickly inspect loans and ensure that the loans are truly given to the poor peasants. Villages can establish winter loan committees, controlled by the poor peasants, who decide who should be loaned to, who should not be loaned to, who should be loaned less, and who should be loaned more. Village credit cooperatives assist in handling loan procedures in business, but cannot decide on the loans. The funds loaned by the cooperatives should be quickly handed over to the winter loan committee for them to decide on how to handle them. 2. Organize the masses to collect firewood and accumulate manure in large quantities to prepare for next year's production conditions. At present, except for some areas where activities have been carried out, this has not yet received widespread attention. In order to lay the foundation for next year's agricultural production and overcome the labor difficulties in spring plowing and sowing, firewood collection and manure accumulation must be carried out as soon as possible; otherwise, once winter is over, it will cause difficulties for next year's production. Localities can combine transportation and weaving, and organize this work according to the different living and production conditions of the area.

　　太行三专署
  　号召检查冬季生产组织群众打柴积肥
    【本报太行讯】三专署根据该专区冬季生产运动情况，提出进一步深入雇贫层，检查与解决雇贫层生产中的困难。专署根据十二月十三日长治联合办公室报导，一区关村冬季生产，在前一段，从解决雇贫困难入手，依托雇贫骨干，带领广大中农，对开展冬季生产起了推动作用，且获得显著成绩，但从整个雇贫层细致检查，发现还有许多户存在有很多困难，有的户有牲口，想运输，没有车辆，有的户想做买卖，没有本钱。因此，三专署特向各县市区村干部提出：一、迅速检查贷款，把贷款真正贷到雇贫手里，各村可成立冬贷委员会，由雇贫掌握，谁该贷，谁不该贷，谁该贷少，谁该贷多，完全由雇贫讨论决定。村信用部，在业务上帮助办理贷款手续，而不能决定贷款，合作社所贷之款，迅速交给冬贷委员会，由他们决定处理。二、组织群众，大量打柴、积肥，准备明年生产条件。日前在这一方面，除部分地区活动外，还没有普遍引起注意，为打下明年农业生产基础，克服春耕下种中劳力困难，打柴积肥必须及早进行，否则冬季一过，即将造成明年生产困难。各地可根据当地生活与生产不同条件，结合运输、纺织，组织这一工作。
