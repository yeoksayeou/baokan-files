Forcing Challenges is Not a Good Method
Zhangyi Village Corrects Recruitment Bias in Time

[This newspaper's report from Jiluyu on the 11th] Puyang's Zhangyi Village inspired the masses to consciously join the army to seek revenge by arousing hatred for Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army. However, in the beginning, as everyone's deliberation was not yet mature, the cadres and activists were impatient and did not wait for the masses to become aware. They then brought up the militia and youth challenges in a domineering manner. The youths said, "If the militia can all go, then we will all go." At that time, although the mood was very enthusiastic, and everyone signed up on the surface, this competition was built on the basis that most people had not been ideologically persuaded. Therefore, they raised many unsolvable difficulties in secret, and the result was actually equivalent to not signing up. The leadership accepted this experience, repeatedly and patiently mobilized, held general family meetings, and waited for the masses to become ideologically persuaded before solemnly holding a registration meeting. At the meeting, fathers sent sons, and wives sent husbands. They scrambled to speak and took to the stage one after another. Among them, six youths had expressed unwillingness to go during the family meetings, but they were moved by the speeches of others who had signed up at the meeting, and they also signed up, expressing their determination to kill the enemy. A total of 70 people signed up.

[This newspaper's report from Jiluyu on the 11th] After the village cadres of Yangguantun Village, Boping, returned to the village from the county's activist meeting, they launched small-group deliberations. The masses realized that fighting Old Chiang could not be separated from fighting the landlords. The five major despots in the village, led by Yang Guanxun, had already fled to Jinan. Yang Guanxun's son, Yang Xiaoyou, was a pistol captain in Jinan. The masses hated him to the bone and unanimously demanded to join the army to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, liberate Jinan, and bring the landlord despots back for trial. When Yang Yanzhen's group recalled the crimes of the five major despots, the village cadres enlightened everyone by saying, "Everyone in our village hates Yang Guanxun. If we don't take action, he won't die." Someone said, "If Old Chiang is not overthrown, will we still have our heads when they come back?" Under mutual enlightenment, everyone raised their awareness. Yang Yanzhen was the first to come around. He thought, "I hate Yang Guanxun. I must join the army and capture him alive!" Under the slogan of "Join the army to destroy Chiang and capture Yang Guanxun alive," the whole village scrambled to sign up. Yang Yuanhuai's wife was the first to express her attitude at the women's meeting, resolutely mobilizing her husband to join the army. Yang Yanzhen's wife guaranteed not to hold him back. Yang Kaizhu and his son competed to sign up. The whole family happily made shoes and socks, steamed dry food, and joyfully sent him off to join the army. Currently, 60 people have signed up in the whole village, and deliberation is still continuing.

    硬挑战不是好办法
    张仪村及时纠正参军偏向
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】濮阳张仪村以蒋匪五军仇恨启发群众自觉参军复仇，但开始，大家酝酿未成熟，干部及积极分子不耐心，不等待群众觉悟，即包办式的提出民兵和青年挑战，青年说：“民兵能都去，咱也都去。”当时，情绪虽很热烈，表面上都报了名，但这种竞赛建立在多数没打通思想的情况下，所以背地里他们提出许多无法解决的困难，结果实际上等于没有报名。领导上接受这次经验，再三耐心作动员，普遍召开家庭会议，等待群众思想打通后，才隆重召开报名会。在会上，父送子、妻送郎，争先讲话，络绎登台，其中有六位青年在家庭会时还表示不愿去，但在会中被别人报名时讲话感动，亦报了名，并表示决心杀敌。共报名者七十人。
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】博平杨官屯村干自到县开活动分子会回村后，展开小组酝酿，群众认清打老蒋和打地主分不开，本村以杨冠勋为首的五大恶霸，已经逃往济南，杨冠勋之子杨小友在济南当手枪队长，群众恨之入骨，一致要求参军打倒蒋介石，解放济南府，把地主恶霸捉回来法办。杨延珍小组追述五大恶霸之罪恶时，村干启发大家说：“咱村人人都恨杨冠勋，咱不动手他死不了。”有人说：“老蒋打不倒他们回来咱还有脑袋不？”在互相启发之下，大家提高了觉悟，杨延珍首先打通了思想，他想：“我恨杨冠勋，我非参军活捉他不行！”全村在“参军灭蒋活捉杨冠勋”的口号下，争先报名。杨员怀的老婆，在妇女会上首先表示态度，坚决的动员丈夫去参军。杨延珍的老婆保证不拉腿，杨开竹父子相争报名，全家欢天喜地赶做鞋袜，蒸干粮欢送参军。现全村已有六十人报名，目前仍继续酝酿中。
