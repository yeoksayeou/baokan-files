Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th. The Lu Zhong Special Commissioners' meeting decided on the following winter production and famine preparedness policy: (1) The general policy is to mobilize and organize the masses to develop textile, transportation, oil extraction, and other sideline production to increase people's income, prepare for the spring famine, and lay the foundation for next year's spring plowing. (2) In terms of textile production: it is required that all 13,800 existing looms and 335 cotton gins be fully operational. In areas with a foundation, calls are made for each household to have a spinning wheel, and in general areas, two households to have one; the entire region is required to increase from the current 130,000 wheels to more than 150,000. Widespread promotion of knitting yarn is also encouraged. (3) Organize 4,000 carts and 4,200 donkeys of the masses, putting them all into the transportation industry to regulate materials in various regions. (4) Organize small oil mills. All existing peanuts, except for seeds, will be pressed into oil and exported to other regions in exchange for grain. Peanut cakes will be preserved for consumption during the spring famine. Each county is required to develop various workshops to 2,250 locations. (5) Rapidly restore all cooperatives destroyed by the Chiang bandits and transform them. Using various cooperatives as the center, organize 450,000 people to engage in textile, transportation, oil extraction, and other industries. (6) In terms of agricultural production: reorganize mutual aid teams, call on the masses to raise pigs, accumulate fertilizer, protect cattle for plowing, prepare vegetable seeds and rice seedlings, and strive for each household to plant a plot of spring vegetables and each person to plant a portion of early rice in the coming spring. In addition to providing loans, the government plans to help more than ten furnace and iron factories resume work so that they can produce plows, shovels, sickles, and other tools before spring plowing. (7) Provide assistance and organization to more than 30,000 people who have been displaced from areas currently occupied by the Chiang bandits, using considerable grain and funds, to engage in production. (8) Strengthen economic and armed struggle against the enemy, protect materials, and thwart the Chiang bandits' conspiracy to plunder and the attempt to use luxury goods to swindle grain from the isolated cities. (9) Correct the serious waste phenomena currently existing in some places, educate cadres and the masses to make long-term plans, oppose lavish eating and drinking, and strictly control village financial expenditures. Those who seriously waste and are unwilling to correct themselves will be punished through the masses. (10) Government agencies and troops should universally carry out production and frugality movements to prepare for famine. At the county level and below, relevant departments can be absorbed to establish a production and famine preparedness committee to achieve close integration with various tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th. The Shandong Provincial Government, the Lu Zhong Administrative Office, and the Lu Zhong Industry and Commerce Bureau are vigorously assisting the people of Lu Zhong, who have suffered the most severe damage from the Chiang bandits, to carry out winter production. The Provincial Government is using 500 million North Sea Currency (each yuan is equivalent to about 30 yuan in Chiang's currency), half of which is loaned to the Yimeng area and half to the masses in the entire Yishan and Taishan areas. The Provincial Government and the Administrative Office have also decided to lend another 300 million yuan in materials to the masses, specifically for transportation, textile, and other industries. In addition to allocating ××10,000 catties of cotton to supply cooperatives in various places, the Industry and Commerce Bureau plans to establish a sufficient number of salt depots along the salt transport route to facilitate the transportation of salt by the masses.
