　　Xikushan Village
  　Strengthening the Militia and Reinforcing River Defenses
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, December 26th] After sixty-nine young men from Xikushan Village in the Eighth District of Dong'a joined the army, the masses, in order to strengthen river defenses and strictly prevent the "Returning Home Corps" from crossing the river to plunder, are stepping up the rectification of the militia organization. Everyone proposed: "Go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and fight the "Returning Home Corps" in the rear." At the mass meeting that day, seventy people signed up to join the militia. After review and discussion by the poor peasant groups and the entire village, the landlords were purged and the old and weak were streamlined, leaving only twenty people, who were organized into two squads. Active poor peasants, Cun Qingshi and Fang Rui, were elected as squad leaders. They have now all been armed and are prepared to fight the "Returning Home Corps" at any time.
