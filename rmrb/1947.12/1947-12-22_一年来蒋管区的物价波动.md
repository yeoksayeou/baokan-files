Price Fluctuations in the KMT-Controlled Areas Over the Past Year
    Huang @
    The Kuomintang-controlled areas have experienced five major price fluctuations in the past year, indicating a further deepening of the economic crisis under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Since the Chiang government announced new import and export trade measures on February 3 this year, which triggered the first major price increase, prices have risen to alarming levels through subsequent surges from April to June, June to July, August to October, and the most recent one that began in mid-November. Taking Shanghai as an example, as of December 13, rice reached as high as one million yuan per dan, nearly 17 times the price in January of this year. The market price of US dollars exceeded 160,000 yuan, more than 22 times higher than in January. The price of cotton had already risen as high as 12 times by mid-October. Compared with before the War of Resistance, the price of rice has risen 100,000 times, cotton textiles more than 100,000 times, and the market price of US dollars more than 53,000 times. The average price of various major commodities has increased by about 190,000 times compared to pre-war levels, and prices in Peiping had already risen by an average of more than 100,000 times by October.
    Looking back at the development trend of the five price surges over the past year, a clear characteristic emerges: each surge lasts longer, the intervals between them become shorter, and the momentum becomes more intense each time. The first surge lasted for a month, from early February to the end of February. The second surge lasted for two months, from early April to early June, before stabilizing. The interval between these two surges was one month. However, only three weeks after the April surge stabilized, the third "June surge" broke out again. When the Chiang government announced new measures for import and export trade and foreign exchange control on August 17, stipulating "open" market prices for foreign exchange and devaluing the Kuomintang currency by more than three times, prices triggered a fourth major fluctuation, which lasted for more than two months until it slightly stabilized in late October. As for the most recent new surge, it started on November 13, less than two weeks after the last surge. According to the current situation in various aspects, the upward trend is still developing, and the people in the KMT-controlled areas are facing the threat of an unprecedented price surge during the New Year period. The speed of price increases has also become more and more fierce over the past year. During the famous May rice riots, the price of rice in Shanghai increased by less than one and a half times in a month and a half (from 185,000 yuan per stone to 450,000 yuan per stone), but from mid-August to mid-October, it increased by nearly three times in two months (from 320,000 yuan per stone to 900,000 yuan). Looking at the market price of US dollars, it increased more than three times in the entire five months from the beginning of the year to the end of May (from 7,000 yuan to 33,000 yuan), but it increased four times in less than four months from August 17 to December 13 (from 40,000 yuan to more than 160,000 yuan). These situations all illustrate that the economic crisis of the Chiang bandits is deteriorating and heading towards an irreparable state. The development of price surges in the KMT-controlled areas over the past year is closely linked to the political and military crisis of the Chiang bandits. Since the Chiang bandits occupied Yan'an in March, the bluster of their paper tiger has been gone forever. The trust of the people in the KMT-controlled areas in the Chiang bandits' paper money has been increasingly shaken with the deepening of the Chiang bandits' political bankruptcy and military crisis. For example, the so-called "reorganization of the government" announced on April 18, which declared the Chiang bandits' own political bankruptcy, immediately stimulated prices to rise by 20% to 50% within a week. The resurgence of the August price surge to a rapid increase in mid-October was directly affected by the People's Liberation Army's shift to a full-scale counter-offensive and the Chiang bandits' continuous defeats in the Northeast and on battlefields north of the Yangtze River. The resurgence of the price surge on the 13th of last month is even more clearly due to the liberation of Shijiazhuang and the victory on various battlefields, which declared that the Chiang bandits' entire military situation was closer to total collapse.
    On the other hand, the price fluctuations in the KMT-controlled areas over the past year have also accelerated the political and military crisis of the Chiang bandits. The Chiang bandit government has not only further abused the issuance of banknotes to squeeze the blood and sweat of the people, but also formulated many so-called "economic policies" and "economic measures" as tools for the four major families to make war fortunes and crisis fortunes. Private industrial and commercial entrepreneurs and wage earners, especially the vast number of workers, are subjected to the heavy oppression of reactionary shackles such as "prohibition of buying and selling," "price limits," "prohibition of transportation," "cessation of lending," "restrictions on exchange," "economic police," "freezing of wages," and "prohibition of strikes." The result is bound to arouse the people's struggle for survival. Therefore, rice riots and anti-hunger labor and student movements have occurred successively in various places over the past year. Especially during the period of soaring rice prices in April and May this year, due to the Chiang government's massive purchase of military grain for the civil war, which artificially created a rice shortage, and then implemented "price limits" and "transportation bans," the price of rice became even higher and the rice shortage became even more serious. For workers and salaried classes, the maximum salary was still restricted to not exceed the cost of living index in January, and strikes and slowdowns were prohibited. This aroused the anger of the vast number of people to resist, and the rice looting by starving people and the strikes, marches, and collective petitions by workers took place in various places. Hundreds of thousands of citizens and workers were involved in the rice looting and anti-hunger labor movements. The starvation policy implemented by the Chiang bandits against the people also aroused a huge torrent of strikes and class boycotts by teachers and students of universities and middle schools in various places to fight for improved treatment. It has developed into a political struggle of "anti-hunger," "anti-civil war," and "anti-oppression" by 500,000 students and professors in major cities throughout the Chiang-controlled areas, shaking Chiang Kai-shek's entire rule. Finally, as the Chiang currency depreciates and is increasingly limited to the starving Chiang Kai-shek's ruling body, the dissatisfaction of millions of civil servants and soldiers is also growing, and hunger is forcing them to become increasingly aware that the so-called "morale" of being cannon fodder for the traitor and dictator Chiang Kai-shek is declining.
    The basic reason for the continuous rise in prices in the KMT-controlled areas is the inevitable result of the Chiang bandit authorities' long-term anti-people financial and economic policies and the malignant inflation caused by the civil war finance. According to experts cited by the World Knowledge magazine published in Shanghai in August, the Chiang government's total expenditure for the whole year is estimated to be about 2 billion US dollars, which is equivalent to more than 100 trillion Chiang coins at the exchange rate at that time. On the income side, even if the Chiang bandits' Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun's expected annual income of 17 trillion can be fully collected, the deficit will still reach 83%, which is more than 83 trillion yuan. This huge fiscal deficit can only be made up by issuing banknotes. According to estimates from various parties based on the situation when the highest denomination of Chiang coins was 10,000 yuan this autumn, the Chiang bandits issued 4 trillion to 6 trillion yuan of banknotes per month, and the issuance of banknotes for the whole year should be around 70 trillion yuan. On the 10th of this month, the Chiang government issued three new customs gold notes with a value of 100,000, 40,000, and 20,000 Chiang coins, and the inflation figures should far exceed this. Under this malignant inflation, the value of Chiang coins will inevitably continue to fall, and prices will inevitably continue to rise. In addition, as the rule of the Chiang bandits is increasingly approaching death, the people's trust in Chiang coins is increasingly lost. As soon as Chiang coins are received, they are immediately put into the goods or foreign currency market, which further accelerates the speed of currency circulation and also accelerates the speed of price increases. As a foreign news agency said: "The new banknotes have triggered another round of inflationary chaos, pushing China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) closer to collapse."
    It is precisely because the malignant inflation caused by Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and civil war is the basic reason for the continuous rise in prices in the KMT-controlled areas, which also determines that the Chiang bandit authorities have no way to solve the increasingly serious price problem. In the past year, although the Chiang bandits have used various methods such as "price limits," "negotiated prices," "prohibition of buying and selling," "tightening of money supply," "borrowing foreign debt," and even bloody terror methods such as dispatching a large number of secret agents to search the market and arrest merchants, they have tried to stabilize prices, but the facts of the year have proved that all these methods have failed. After each "measure," prices rose faster and the fluctuation time was longer. Each "measure" and each price fluctuation forced millions of people to join the ranks of bankruptcy and starvation, while the four major families made a fortune. In fact, every so-called economic measure of the Chiang bandit authorities is just a tool for the four major families to make crisis fortunes and civil war fortunes.
    Therefore, the vast number of people in the KMT-controlled areas have increasingly realized that only by completely overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and establishing a coalition government, realizing new democracy, can the people's lives be guaranteed and can they permanently get rid of the threat of high prices.

### 一年来蒋管区的物价波动

　　一年来蒋管区的物价波动
    黄＠
    蒋管区一年来一共发生了五次大的物价波动，说明了蒋介石统治的经济危机的进一步加深。自今年二月三日蒋政府宣布进出口贸易新措施开始了物价的第一次大涨后，又经过四月至六月、六月至七月、八月至十月，以及最近开始于上月中旬的各次涨风，物价已上涨至惊人高度。以上海为例，截至本月十三日止，大米每担高达一百万元，几为今年一月米价的十七倍，美汇市价超出十六万元，较今年一月涨高二十二倍，棉花价格早在十月中旬，即已涨达十二倍之多。若与抗战前比较，米价已上涨十万倍，棉织品在十万倍以上，美汇市价亦达五万三千余倍。各种主要商品价格平均较战前涨高十九万倍左右，北平物价迄十月份已平均上涨十万倍以上。
    回顾一年来五次涨风的发展趋势，首先可以看出一个明显的特点，即每次涨风的时间越来越长，间歇越来越短，及涨势一次比一次更为猛烈。第一次涨风由二月初开始至二月底结束，历时共一个月。第二次涨风自四月上旬至六月上旬共经两个月才告稳定，此两次涨风中的间歇期为一个月。但四月涨风稳定下来只有三个礼拜，第三次的“六月涨风”便又爆发了。当八月十七日蒋政府宣布了进出口贸易及外汇管制新办法，规定外汇“公开”市价，将蒋币贬值三倍以上，物价又掀起了第四次大波动，而且持续两个多月，直到十月下旬才稍告稳定。至于最近一次新涨风，系自十一月十三日开始，距离上次涨风还不到两个礼拜。根据目前各方面情况来看，涨势还在发展，蒋区人民正面临年关时期物价空前狂涨的威胁。一年来物价上涨速度亦是越发展越凶猛的。上海米价在著名的五月米骚动期间，一个半月上涨还不到一倍半（一八五、○○○元一石涨至四五○、○○○元一石），但自八月中旬至十月中旬两个月却上涨几达三倍之多（由三十二万一石涨至九十万元）。再从美汇市价来看，今年年初至五月底，整五个月上涨三倍多（由七千元涨到三万三千元），而自八月十七日至本月十三日不到四个月，却上涨四倍（由四万元涨至十六万元以上）以上。这些情形，都说明了蒋匪经济危机日益恶化，走向不可收拾的地步。一年来蒋管区物价的涨风发展，是与蒋匪政治军事危机密切联系着的。自三月间蒋匪占延安之后，其纸老虎的威风从此一去而不可复返，蒋管区人民对蒋匪纸币的信任，随着蒋匪政治破产与军事危机深刻化而日益动摇。例如四月十八日宣告蒋匪自身政治破产的所谓“改组政府”，立刻刺激物价于一周内上涨百分之二十至百分之五十。八月涨风发展至十月中旬的再度突飞猛涨，即由于人民解放军转入全面大反攻，蒋匪在东北及长江以北全国各战场不断失利的直接影响。而上月十三日涨风重新掀起，更明显地是由于石家庄之解放与各战场的胜利宣告了蒋匪整个军事局势更接近于总崩溃的影响。
    另一方面，一年来蒋管区的物价波动，也加速了蒋匪政治军事的危机。蒋匪政府不但进一步滥发钞票榨取人民的血汗，而且制定许多所谓“经济政策”、“经济措施”，作为四大家族发内战财发危机财的工具，民营工商业家薪资收入者特别是广大劳工、则受着“禁止买卖”，“限价”“禁运”，“停止放款”，“限制汇兑”，“经济警察”，“冻结工资”，“禁止罢工”等反动枷锁的重重压迫。其结果必然激起广大人民的求生斗争。因此一年来米骚动和反饥饿的工潮学潮在各地相继发生。特别是今年四五月米价狂涨期间，由于蒋政府大量搜购内战军粮人工造成米荒后，又实行“限价”，“禁运”，使米价更高，米荒更为严重，对工人及薪金阶层则仍限制其最高薪资不得超过一月份生活指数并禁止罢工怠工。遂激起了广大人民的反抗怒火，各地饥民的抢米风潮，和各地工人的罢工、游行、集体请愿。卷入抢米风潮及反饥饿工潮之市民及工人，各达数十万。蒋匪对人民实施的饥饿政策，也激起了各地大中学教员学生为争取改善待遇而举行的罢教罢课交织成巨大的洪流，一直发展成全蒋管区南北各大城市五十万学生教授“反饥饿”、“反内战”、“反压迫”的政治性大斗争，震撼了蒋介石的整个统治。最后随着蒋币跌价而日益限于饥饿的蒋介石统治机构的数百万公务员与士兵，不满情绪亦日益增长，饥饿迫使他们日益觉悟起来，为卖国贼与独裁者蒋介石当炮灰的所谓“士气”正在日趋下降。
    蒋管区物价不断上升的基本原因，是蒋匪当局长期反人民的财政经济政策及内战财政下所造成的恶性通货膨胀的必然结果。据八月间上海出版的世界知识杂志所引专家的估计，今年全年蒋政府之总支出约达二十亿美元，以当时汇率计算，合蒋币一百万亿元以上。在收入方面，即使蒋匪财政部长俞鸿钧所预期的全年收入十七万亿真能收足，不敷仍达百分之八十三即八十三万亿元以上。此一庞大的财政赤字，只有靠发钞来弥补。据各方以今年秋季蒋币最高票面为一万元时之情况估计，蒋匪每月发钞数在四万亿至六万亿元之间，今年全年发钞当在七十万亿元左右。本月十日蒋政府又发行价值十万、四万、及二万蒋币之新关金券三种，膨胀数字当更远超于此。在此恶性通货膨胀下，蒋币币值必然不断下跌，物价必然不断上涨。再加上蒋匪统治日益接近死亡，人民对蒋币信任日益丧失，蒋币到手便立即投入货物或外币市场，更加速了通货流通速度，也更加速了物价的上涨速度。正如某外国通讯社所说的：“新钞激起了又一次通货膨胀的混乱，将中国（指蒋管区）经济更接近地推向于崩溃”。
    正因为蒋介石卖国、独裁内战所造成的恶性通货膨胀，乃是蒋管区物价不断上涨的基本原因，这也就决定了蒋匪当局没有可能解决日益严重的物价问题。在过去一年中蒋匪虽以“限价”、“议价”、“禁止买卖”、“抽紧银根”、“借外债”，甚至血腥恐怖手段出动大批特务搜查市场逮捕商人等各种办法，企图平抑物价，然一年的事实证明这一切办法均归于失败。每一次“措施”之后物价涨得更快波动时间更长。每一次“措施”与每一次物价波动都迫使千百万人民加入破产饥饿的队伍，同时四大家族则大发其财。事实上，蒋匪当局每一次的所谓经济措施，都仅仅是四大家族发危机财发内战财的工具。
    因此，蒋管区广大人民已日益觉悟，只有彻底打倒蒋介石成立联合政府，实现了新民主主义，人民的生活才能得到保障，才能永久摆脱高物价的威胁。
