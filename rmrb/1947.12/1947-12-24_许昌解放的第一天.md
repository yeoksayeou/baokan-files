　　The First Day of the Liberation of Xuchang
    Yè Jiālín

    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 22nd Dispatch] On the morning of the 15th, amidst swirling snowflakes, I, a reporter, trod the muddy road into the ancient city of Xuchang, a stronghold where Chiang's troops had been garrisoned, now freshly liberated. Liberation Army soldiers were test-firing weapons just seized from the enemy, the sound of gunfire sporadic. Dozens of large mules, dragging more than ten American-made mountain guns and anti-tank guns, galloped towards us. Following them were dozens of ten-wheeled trucks, filled with smiling Liberation Army soldiers, marching grandly through the streets. The soldiers were helping the masses dismantle the fortifications left by Chiang's bandits, and helping the people carry the doors from the fortifications back home. Every household was sweeping the garbage in front of their doors, and every shop was scrubbing away the fascist civil war slogans left by Chiang's bandits. On the wall of the Catholic church, several people were concentrating on repainting a huge new slogan: "Support Mao Zedong, the Representative of the Chinese People." Before noon, all the shops had opened for business, and the currency exchange set up by the democratic government's city work committee was crowded with people. The currency of the liberated areas was immediately being snatched up and circulated in the market. In front of the Xuchang branch of the Administrative Office, the Liberation Army was distributing rice that had never been opened to the poor citizens, and helping the elderly and weak carry the grain back home. The poor people who received the grain were all beaming with smiles.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 22nd Dispatch] Chiang's military officers who laid down their weapons in the battle to capture Xuchang were given travel expenses by the Liberation Army and sent back to their hometowns within two hours after the end of the battle. As of the 17th, more than 700 Chiang's military officers, political workers, and local administrative personnel had been released. Before leaving, they happily and spontaneously lined up and shouted slogans such as "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" and regretted not being able to visit the liberated areas.

　　许昌解放的第一天
    叶加林
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十二日电】十五日清晨，白雪纷飞，记者踏着泥泞的道路进入刚才解放的平汉路蒋军屯兵据点许昌古城，解放军战士们正在试放刚从敌人手里缴获的武器，枪声疏落的响着。数十头大骡子，拖着十多尊美式山炮和战防炮迎面驰来。接着，是几十辆十轮大卡车，满载笑容满面的解放军战士，浩浩荡荡驶过市街。战士们在帮着群众平毁蒋匪遗下的工事，又帮助老百姓把工事里的门板扛送回家。家家户户都在打扫门口的垃圾，每家商店都洗刷蒋匪留下的法西斯内战标语，天主堂的墙头有几个人正在聚精会神的重新刷写着：“拥护代表中国人民的毛泽东”的巨幅新标语。天还不到正午，各家商店都已开门营业，民主政府城市工作委员会设立的票币兑换所门前挤满人群，解放区的钞票立即被人们争抢着在市面流通。行总许昌分会门首，解放军正将从未开仓的大米发给贫苦市民，并帮助老弱扛回粮食。领得粮食的贫民都满面笑容。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十二日电】攻克许昌之役中放下武器的蒋军军官，在战斗结束后两小时即由解放军发给路费遣送回籍。至十七日止已释放蒋军军官、政工人员、地方行政人员等七百多人。他们临行时都高兴的自动整队高呼“中国人民解放军万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！”等口号，并以未能赴解放区参观为遗憾。
