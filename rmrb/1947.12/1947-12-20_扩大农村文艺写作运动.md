    Expand the Rural Literary and Artistic Writing Movement
    Wang Yaping
    To cultivate "budding literature and art" and "expand the writing movement," we must first turn our attention to the countryside and focus on the rural areas.
    The emancipated peasants, with their progress in knowledge and improvement in culture, can no longer be satisfied with the old feudal culture. Some of the "Eighteen Levels of Hell" paintings on temple walls have been pushed down by the masses, and some rural painters have changed to painting New Year pictures of "Abundant Food and Clothing" and "Emancipated Production." Many rural theater troupes no longer perform "Si Lang Visits His Mother"; they are vying to write realistic dramas and perform "The Death of Ge Qiaoyun." Some of the masses who are literate and can read songbooks no longer recite "Huang Aiyu Visits the Grave," and have begun to read newspapers, periodicals, and "Xiao Erhei Gets Married." The artists who sing *zhuizi* and play the *yangqin* no longer sing "The Case of Bao Gong" or "Wang Lin Abandons His Wife"; they have changed to singing "The Great Battle of Yanghu" and "Old Chiang's Ten Points of Treachery."
    Following such needs, the newspapers and pictorials of the local committees and county committees were launched; the blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, and radio stations of the districts and villages were established; and the local rural theater troupes, music training classes, and artist training classes were established. These newborn cultural groups, newly published tabloids, pictorials, and blackboard newspapers are symbolizing the progress, improvement, and prosperity of the new democratic culture in the liberated rural areas.
    The Jilu Yu District Committee's call to "expand the writing movement" and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' launch of "soliciting contributions with prize money" were both generated based on the demands of the rural masses. Some people say: "There are few literate people in the countryside, what can they write? What can they appreciate?" In fact, under the influence of land reform, the progress of the masses is rapid and amazing. Two district cadres in Shou Zhang Third District, who did not know a single character, learned culture for three years on their own, and now they can take notes and write for tabloids. In Zhukou, I personally saw an elementary school teacher reading newspapers to dozens of members of rural theater troupes, reading news of the victory of the great counter-offensive. They all listened with relish, smiling and applauding. This proves that the "appreciation" and "writing" level of the masses have generally improved. Even illiterate masses, by speaking it out, and having others write it down, can produce good clappers, ballads, and stories.
    In addition to this, there are also the following people in the countryside who can write and paint: 1. Elementary school teachers; 2. Rural intellectuals; 3. Folk artists; 4. Members of rural theater troupes; 5. Literate honorary soldiers; 6. Unit instructors and soldiers living in the countryside; 7. Some district and village cadres; 8. Middle and high school students, etc. These people want to write, love to write, but they are distressed because they don't know how to write? No one gives them feedback, and there is no place to publish. As a result, some dare not start writing, and some have been rejected after writing, and cannot be published, so they put down their pens.
    The "writing movement" and "soliciting contributions with prize money" are precisely the stimulants to encourage these people to write and to unleash their creative talents. When the notice of the District Party Committee Propaganda Department to expand the writing movement was sent to the Shou Zhang Third District District Department, several comrades who loved to write jumped up and said, "This is great, we now have a way to write, let's write more!" The Federation of Literary and Art Circles posted a notice in the newspaper about "soliciting contributions with prize money." In less than ten days, we received more than forty "paintings" and "manuscripts." They also attached enthusiastic letters: "I was very excited when I saw your solicitation, I haven't written for a long time, and I wrote this one again!" Some said: "I didn't dare to write before, but now I'm starting to write!" Some said: "This is an old work, I revised it and gave it to you for review!" Of these forty-plus submissions, *Pingyuan Literature and Art* used one, and *New Earth* used two. *Pictorial* used one. These were all relatively well-written and well-painted. In addition to being published, the original manuscripts are also being preserved and will be submitted to the "Judging Committee" for evaluation.
    This writing movement, it is hoped, can be greatly promoted to discover as many new people and new works as possible. As far as we know, the following works are popular in the countryside: 1. Clapper talks; 2. Folk tunes; 3. *Zhuizi* ballads; 4. *Yangqin* tunes; 5. Magic lantern tunes; 6. Scripts; 7. Ballads; 8. Wall paintings; 9. New Year pictures; 10. Propaganda posters; 11. Clay sculptures; 12. Woodcut paintings; 13. Couplets; 14. Wall newspapers; 15. Door panel newspapers; 16. Blackboard newspapers; 17. Scripts; 18. Correspondences, reports; 19. Folk tales; 20. Songbooks, etc. These works are all literature and art in their infancy, all new types of mass works.
    From the perspective of expression methods and content, these works do have their unique characteristics: 1. The theme is clear. Whether they write about a person, an event, or a news story, they all have a good theme and can be combined with the central work. 2. Rich in mass emotions, without any pretentious problems of intellectuals, expressing the current reality with the sentiments of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. 3. Short, lively, and powerful in form. 4. The language is popular, good-looking, easy to understand, and easy to sing. 5. Can be sung (ballads, songs, clapper talks, *zhuizi*, etc.) Can be performed (scripts) Can attract audiences (paintings). These characteristics are inherent to the peasants, and are what the peasants like to see and hear. After they see them, hear them, and read them, they are naturally easily accepted and easily moved.
    We are not afraid of being shallow, and we don't dislike being vulgar. These works are precisely the targets of our solicitation for prizes. Short three words and two sentences, writing about one person, one thing, one piece of news, a story, big to narrative poems, novels, scripts, we all welcome! No one is born a writer. The saying that "literature and art is only for a few people" has long been denied by the masses. Today, those who can write and love to write, pick up your pens immediately and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers with various art forms!

### 扩大农村文艺写作运动

    扩大农村文艺写作运动
    王亚平
    我们要培养“萌芽期的文艺”，“扩大写稿运动”，首先要把视线转向农村，把重点放在农村。
    翻身的农民，随着知识的进步，文化的提高，他们不能再满足那些陈旧的封建文化。有些庙墙上的“十八层地狱图”被群众推倒了，有的农村画家改画了“丰衣足食图”和“翻身生产”的年画；很多农村剧团不再演“四郎探母”，他们争着编现实剧，演“葛巧云之死”：一些识字读唱本的群众，他们不再念“黄爱玉上坟”，也都开始读报纸、刊物、“小二黑结婚”了；唱坠子打洋琴的艺人，也不再唱“包公案”“王林休妻”，都改唱着“大战阳湖”和“老蒋卖国十条”了。
    跟着这样的需要，各地委、县委的报纸、画报创刊了；各区村的黑板报、墙报、广播台建立了；各地的农村剧团，音乐训练班，艺人训练班成立了。这些新生的文化团体，新出的小报、画刊、黑板报，正象征着解放区农村文艺的进步，提高，新民主主义文化的繁荣。
    冀鲁豫区党委号召“扩大写稿运动”，文联发动“征稿奖金”，都是基于农村群众的要求产生的。有人说：“农村识字的人少，他们能写啥？能欣赏啥？”其实，在土地改革的影响下，群众的进步是迅速的，惊人的。寿张三区的两个区干部，从不识一个字，自己学了三年文化，现在能记笔记，能给小报写稿了。在竹口我亲眼见到一个小学教员对着几十个农村剧团团员念报纸，念大反攻胜利的消息，他们都津津有味的听着，笑着，拍手。这里证明了群众的“欣赏”和“写作”程度都普遍地提高了。不识字的群众，他们用口念着，替他们记下来，也能有好快板、歌谣、故事产生出来。
    除此而外，农村里能写稿的、能画画的，还有：一、小学教员；二、农村知识分子；三、民间艺人；四、农村剧团的团员；五、识字的荣誉军人；六、住在农村的部队指导员、战士；七、一部分区村干部；八、中高小的学生等。这些人想写稿，爱写稿，他们苦闷的是不知怎样写？写了没有人提意见，没有发表的地方。结果，有的不敢下笔，有的写着碰了钉子，登不出来，就搁了笔。
    “写稿运动”和“征稿奖金”正是鼓励这些人写稿，发挥创作才能的兴奋剂。区党委宣传部扩大写稿运动的通知下到寿张三区区部，几个爱写稿的同志看了，都跳起来说；“这一下可好了，写稿有了门径，咱多写吧！”文联的“征稿奖金”在报上登出启事，不到十天，我们收到的“画稿”“文稿”已有四十余件。他们还附来热情的信；“看到你们的征稿，我很兴奋，很久不写了，又写了这一篇！”有的说：“我从前不敢写，现在也写起来！”有的说：“这是一篇旧作，改了一下，给你们评阅吧！”这四十多件来稿，平原文艺用了一篇，新地用了两篇。画报用了一篇，都是写得画得比较出色的，除发表外，原稿还保存着，将来交“评奖委员会”评奖。
    这次写稿运动，希望能大力推动一下，尽量多发现新人、新作品。据我们所知道的农村里流行的有以下这些作品：一、快板，二、小调，三、坠子，四、洋琴调，五、洋片调，六、剧本，七、歌谣，八、墙画，九、年画，十、宣传画，十一、泥塑，十二、木刻画，十三、对联，十四、墙报，十五、门板报，十六、黑板报，十七、剧本，十八、通讯、报告，十九、民间故事，二十、歌本唱本等。这些作品都是萌芽期的文艺，都是新型的群众性的作品。
    这些作品，从表现方法及内容上来看，确有它独有的特点：一、主题明确，他们写一个人，一件事，一件新闻、都有好的主题，又能结合中心工作。二、富群众情感，没有一点知识分子矫揉造作的毛病，用工农大众的情调表现当前的现实。三、形式简短，活泼，有力。四、语言通俗好看，好懂，容易上口。五、能唱，（歌谣、歌曲、快板、坠子等）能演（剧本）能吸引观众（画稿）。这些特点都是农民固有的，农民喜见乐闻的，他们看了，听了，读了，自然就容易接受，容易受感动。
    我们不怕浅，不嫌俗，这些作品，正是我们征奖的对象。短的三言两语，写一人一事，一件消息，故事，大的到叙事诗、长篇小说、剧本，我们都欢迎！谁也不是天生成的作家。“文艺只是少数人的事”，那种说法早被群众否定了。今天能写的、爱写的，马上执起笔来，用各种艺术形式为工农兵服务！
