Xinhua News Agency, SuLuYuWan, 4th. Since the People's Liberation Army arrived in YuWanSu, the militia and township armed forces on both sides of the Wo River in northern Anhui, who have persisted in struggle behind Chiang, have rapidly expanded more than threefold. After the struggle of dividing grain and distributing floating wealth, the awareness of the peasants in various townships has been raised, and they have risen up to search and confiscate the hidden guns of landlords, despots, and "Returning Home Regiments," donating them to the militia. Yimen District of Wohe County has already searched out fourteen rifles. A Liang surnamed peasant in Liuyuan dug out a machine gun and a Czech-style rifle buried by Chiang Kai-shek's "Self-Defense Force" from the sweet potato field and gave it to the democratic government. Members of the Yimen District Team who were coerced into joining Chiang Kai-shek's "Self-Defense Force" have all repented to the government and stood on the side of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, SuLuYuWan Frontline, 4th. The YuWanSu People's Liberation Army re-entered Zhecheng in eastern Henan on the 28th of last month, capturing more than 50 local Chiang Kai-shek bandits alive, killing and wounding more than 30, and seizing two light machine guns, thirty long and short guns, and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition.

    【新华社苏鲁豫皖四日电】坚持蒋后斗争之皖北涡河两岸民兵区乡武装，自解放大军进抵豫皖苏以来，已急剧壮大三倍以上。各乡农民经过分粮分浮财斗争，觉悟提高，纷纷搜缴地主恶霸及“还乡团”等暗藏之枪支赠送民兵。涡河县义门区已搜出步枪十四枝。刘园一梁姓农民从红芋地里扒出蒋匪“自卫队”埋藏的一挺机枪和一枝捷克式，送给民主政府。义门区队被胁骗参加蒋匪“自卫队”队员，均向政府悔过，站到人民方面来。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线四日电】豫皖苏人民解放军于上月二十八日再次进驻豫东之柘城，生俘土著蒋匪五十余名，毙伤三十余，缴轻机枪二挺，长短枪三十枝，子弹四千余发。
