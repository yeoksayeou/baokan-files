　　【Reported from Taihang on the 6th of this month】 Senior elementary schools in Li Cheng and Ping Shun and other places are trying everything possible to solve the difficulties of poor and hired peasants, and create opportunities and conditions for their children to attend school. Li Cheng Fourth Senior Primary School, in order to solve the difficulty that the families of poor and hired peasants cannot afford to support their children, proposed to the parents: in addition to grain, all expenses and vegetable money will be guaranteed by the school's production, and will not be taken from home. Ping Shun Third Senior Primary School proposed: that the children of emancipated peasants should be accepted for enrollment, even those who are older or have a lower level of education, and that students returning home should be used to promote the school among peasants in large numbers during the autumn holidays. Now forty-seven emancipated children have flocked to the school. At the parents' mobilization meeting in Ao Zhi Village, the parents of the emancipated children all said: "In the past, we poor people could not study, and schools were for the landlords. Now the school has become ours. If we don't let our children go, who will we let go? We have houses, land, and status, and now we are told to study. It's really blessing on top of blessing." Of the original 113 students in the First Senior Primary School, 47 were new middle peasants, 48 were old middle peasants, 5 were new rich peasants, and 13 were of other components. This school began this winter semester and has increased the number of emancipated children by 46 within 20 days.

　　黎城平顺高小想办法解决贫雇入学困难
    【本报太行六日电】黎城、平顺等地高级小学校，想尽一切办法，解决贫雇农民的困难，为贫雇子弟创造入学机会和条件。黎城四高为解决贫雇子弟家庭供给不起的困难，向家长提出：除粮食外，一切费用及菜金，保证由学校生产供给，不向家里拿。平顺三高提出：翻身农民子弟入学，即年龄较大、文化程度较低者也都要，并利用秋假期间，让回家同学大量向农民宣传，现已有四十七名翻身子弟涌入学校。奥治村家长动员会上，翻身子弟家长都说：“过去咱穷人不能念书，都是地主的学校，现在学校成了咱们的，不叫咱子弟去叫谁去，咱有了房屋、有了土地、有了地位、又叫咱去念书，真是福上加福。”一高原有学生一百十三名中，有新中农四十七名，旧中农四十八名，新富农五名，其他成份十三名。该校今冬开学，在二十天内，即增加翻身子弟四十六名。
