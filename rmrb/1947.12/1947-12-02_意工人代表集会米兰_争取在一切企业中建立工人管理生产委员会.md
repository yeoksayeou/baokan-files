Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, Rome, 27th: Seven thousand representatives from the All-Italy Worker-Managed Production Committees and factory internal affairs committees convened a meeting in Milan on the 23rd. Longo (one of the Italian Communist Party leaders), chairman of the meeting's preparatory committee and one of the leaders of the worker-managed production committee movement, addressed the meeting, calling for the establishment of worker-managed production committees in all enterprises to safeguard the interests of industry and agriculture. He pointed out: "Protecting the interests of Italian industry and agriculture, in response to the go-slow policies implemented by employers and the government, has become the most important task for all working people, workers, professionals, agricultural workers, and tenant farmers in urban and rural areas. At present, the task of safeguarding the living standards of the working people cannot be resolved in individual enterprises or localities, nor can it be resolved through the usual trade union struggles." Longo then called on workers to expand the struggle and strive to establish this committee in all localities and enterprises and to obtain legal recognition. He further exclaimed: "The national working people, all democratic parties, and all mass organizations must participate in this struggle. The issue of worker-managed production committees is a political issue, an issue of who will decide the fate of the country and the national economy in the future—the power of capitalists or the power of workers." The meeting passed an important resolution to transform the preparatory committee into a permanent central committee of the worker-managed production committee movement and to establish local liaison committees with representatives from democratic political groups, trade unions, and mass organizations. The resolution called on the Italian people's forces to unite into a broad democratic front to defend labor, peace, and independence, and to fight for the fundamental transformation of the national social institutions, and to fight against malicious provocations and attempts to reorganize reactionary and fascist forces. The resolution demanded that the committee should have the following powers: participate in the drafting of enterprises' economic and industrial plans, regulate the cost, price, profit, investment, conclusion of commercial agreements, storage of goods, and property status of enterprises' products. (Note: The worker-managed production committee is a public management organization for industry, composed of employee and employer representatives from all factories employing more than two hundred and fifty workers. The factory internal affairs committee is a group of local trade unions.)

　　意工人代表集会米兰
    争取在一切企业中建立工人管理生产委员会
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社罗马二十七日讯：全意工人管理生产委员会，及工厂内务委员会的七千代表，二十三日于米兰召开会议。该会议筹备委员会主席及管理生产委员会运动的领袖之一隆哥（为意共领袖之一）在会上演说，号召为保卫工农业的利益而在一切企业中建立工人管理生产委员会。他指出：“针对着雇主及政府所实行的怠工政策，保卫意大利工农业的利益，已成为城乡一切劳动人民、工人、职业界、农业工人与佃农的最重要任务。目前保障劳动人民生活水平的任务不能在各别的企业或各别的地方获得解决，也不能用通常的工会斗争方式来解决。”隆哥继号召工人扩大斗争，争取在各地及一切企业中成立这一委员会，并得到合法的承认。他接着力呼：“全国劳动人民，一切民主党派以及一切群众团体，必须参加这一斗争。工人管理生产委员会的问题是一个政治问题，一个将来由谁决定国家命运与国民经济的问题——由资本家的势力或工人的势力来决定的问题。”该会通过重要决议，将筹备委员会变为工人管理生产委员会运动的永久中央委员会，并成立地方联络委员会，由一民主的政治团体、工会与群众团体的代表参加。决议号召意大利人民力量团结为广泛民主阵线，以保卫劳动、和平、独立及为国家社会机构的根本改造而斗争，为反抗恶意挑衅及重新组织反动与法西斯势力的企图而斗争。决议要求委员会应有下列职权：参加企业的经济与工业计划的起草，管制生产品的成本、价格、利润、投资、缔结商业协定、储藏货品以及企业的财产状况等。（按：工人管理生产委员会，是对工业的公共管理机构，由雇用二百五十名工人以上的一切工厂员工及雇主代表所组成。工厂内务委员会，是各地方工会的团体。）
