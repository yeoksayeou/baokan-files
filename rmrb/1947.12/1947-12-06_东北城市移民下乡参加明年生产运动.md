　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. Following the Northeast Administrative Committee's decision to assist impoverished urban residents in migrating to the countryside to participate in next year's large-scale production movement, the people of various cities have responded with widespread enthusiasm. The first group of migrants from Harbin, consisting of 2,000 households, approximately 10,000 people, will be relocated to Wuchang, Bin County, Yanshou, and other counties before the end of December. Mudanjiang plans to complete the migration of 15,000 people between this winter and next spring. In Shuangcheng County, the number of people who voluntarily signed up to relocate has reached 2,000 households, with the first and second groups, totaling 5,400 people, having already arrived in Tonghe. Another 900 households will be assigned to Weihe and other areas. Immigration from other cities such as Qiqihar, as well as Songjiang, Hejiang, and Jilin provinces, is also being actively carried out. Songjiang Province has called for the relocation of 20,000 people from counties with large populations to the countryside for production. Harbin announced immigration regulations on November 25th and held a joint meeting of Songjiang and Harbin immigrants to discuss specific measures. It was decided that immigration should be based on the principle of free association, with every five households forming a group to adjust their labor force for mutual assistance in production. In addition to announcing that immigrants who cultivate wasteland will be exempt from paying public grain in the first year, local democratic governments have also allocated large amounts of agricultural loans to help solve difficulties and engage in production. Currently, immigrant mobilization committees have been established in various cities to lead this work in a planned manner. During the relocation, the government provides immigrants with food, lodging, and transportation expenses, and also sends special personnel to escort them. When they depart, neighbors in their original streets give them a warm send-off, and generously donate clothing, cloth, and food. When immigrants from Hulan County immigrated from the street, the farmers' association also presented 1.4 million yuan of struggle fruits and street neighbors' consolation money as a production fund. The various receiving areas have organized resettlement committees, mobilized the masses to arrange for welcoming, guaranteed that houses are prepared, windows are papered, and the kang is heated, and have also prepared half a month's worth of firewood to ensure that they will be allocated land next spring and solve the problems of agricultural tools and seeds. Currently, new and old households in various immigrant areas are actively launching a mutual assistance and relief movement, actively organizing winter production to solve current livelihood problems and lay the foundation for large-scale production next spring.
