　　In order to universally launch the winter production movement, the Taihang Third Prefectural Commissioner's Office once again called for a swift mobilization of the masses and their organization into winter production, proposing the following points:
    First: Facing the masses, breaking the mentality of waiting, this is the main key to carrying out winter production in our region at present. Leading cadres at all levels generally have a problem in their thinking, namely, setting aside the masses' demands for making up for losses and overcoming famine through actively engaging in winter production, and waiting there; or thinking that this winter is mainly for re-examination and the production time is not long, or only combined with problems and other non-mass viewpoints. From the perspective of leadership in various counties and cities, some have not yet uniformly studied and deployed winter production; some have deployed it, but it is crude and general; some have assigned tasks to economic departments such as the county federation of cooperatives, industry and commerce, and banks to be responsible for winter production. Still others are satisfied with the existing winter production habits of the masses, or the actions of a few advanced villages, while ignoring the mobilization of ordinary villages, or ignore the threat of the entire crop failure to the peasants (especially the poor and hired laborers) because they are satisfied with the "plow three keep one" of individual villages and households. Breaking these ideas and clearing one's head becomes the first key to carrying out the movement. It is necessary to make all cadres fully realize that this year's winter production is of special significance compared with previous years, it is a guarantee for preventing famine, building wealth, and supporting the war, and it is the urgent demand of the entire peasantry, especially the poor and hired laborers. Failure to grasp leadership is a violation of the real interests of the masses. In some places that have already taken action, such as Shadi Station in Ping Shun and Nantianhe in Changzhi, the movement will be launched quickly if the leadership is strengthened and relies on the poor and hired laborers. In the Shili District of Huguan, on the 10th of last month, an inspection revealed that seven out of eight villages had not yet started winter spinning, and there were still 23 poor and hired households in the entire district who could not afford cotton clothes for the winter. After the leadership cleared their minds, they immediately mobilized the masses, revised the plan, and the movement was quickly launched.
    Second: Start immediately and organize concretely. (1) Break the erroneous practices of following old methods and sticking to them, as well as grand but impractical plans or merely calling without organizing, face reality, start immediately, and carry out concrete organizational work. (2) Adapt to local conditions and times, go deep into the masses to help them create and open up all favorable conditions for production, and solve problems in sideline production (such as blind production, no goods for transportation, no return trips, inability to sell local products, etc.). Cooperatives at all levels must play a core role in this regard. Some areas have new developments and creations: such as (1) combining production, transportation, and sales, solving the problem of unsalable local products and no means of transportation. For example, after Lucheng opened up the western sales route, it set up stations in Weizi Town and Henan Dian, organizing the masses to transport local products such as persimmons, peanuts, and coal to Tunliu in exchange for grain, and then transport the grain to Henan Dian to bring back salt. The Xijing area of Licheng also organized the masses to carry persimmons to Wuxiang in exchange for charcoal. This not only made money but also adjusted the supply and demand in various markets. It should be noted that relevant stations must be closely connected and exchange information, otherwise, blindness is still unavoidable. (2) Combining with military industrial production solves the difficulties of factory labor supply, and the masses also benefit, which is a win-win situation. Many villages near the factory in Changzhi have signed contracts with the factory to transport coal, ore, and equipment, and have made great profits. In the past, Licheng did not communicate with the factory in production leadership, so the factory felt that the fuel supply was difficult, and the masses felt that there was no means of transportation. After the county federation of cooperatives recently established contact, both parties were facilitated. (3) The high-interest mentality of the masses, who value big things but not small ones, must be resolved at any time. After calculating accounts, the Xia Village of Licheng made it clear that "eating outside the province and at home, over time, is also a big income." Cadres who have this kind of thinking must be thoroughly eliminated, otherwise, they will show no confidence or courage in organizing mass production.
    Third, quickly issue winter loans to solve the production difficulties of the poor and hired laborers. The huge amount of winter loans of over 200 million yuan issued in our region has lasted for a month, and most areas have not yet loaned it to the poor and hired laborers, which is a serious problem. There are two reasons why winter loans are issued so slowly. One is that the cadres do not pay enough attention and do not cooperate enough. The other is that the comrades responsible for lending still have the wrong views and practices of past loans, so that although there is a new loan route (the poor and hired labor route), it cannot be well implemented, and even serious mistakes occur: For example, three poor and hired households in Lingtou Village, Licheng, borrowed 90,000 yuan this spring to buy a horse. Recently, during the re-lending, they were forced to sell the horse to repay the loan.
    How to make loans fast and good? First of all, we must focus on the poor and hired laborers, attach importance to this year's winter loans, and work with comrades from banks and cooperatives to handle them together. We must lend to the poor and hired laborers through the poor and hired laborers, thoroughly eliminate the old views that violate the class line, and correct the past erroneous views of first considering whether the loan can be "repaid" when issuing loans, and only managing loans without organizing their production. It must be made clear that not only must it be guaranteed that loans are given to the poor and hired laborers, but also that their production must be organized so that loans can truly play the role of supporting the production of the poor and hired laborers. In this way, the contradiction between loans and repayments can be resolved. In practice, the poor and hired laborers should review the loan households and loan amounts. The amount of loans should be based on the principle of truly solving some of their actual difficulties, and should generally be more concentrated. It must be based on households as the object. The past practice of concentrating loans to cooperatives or mutual aid groups is problematic.
    In addition, the interest rate issue must also be discussed and decided by the poor and hired laborers. The general limit for village credit departments should not exceed twice the original interest rate of the bank. Credit loan departments in counties, districts, and village cooperatives should widely absorb mass idle funds, invigorate rural finance, and serve the poor and hired laborers. In short, it is necessary to specifically solve the funding difficulties of the poor and hired laborers in order to quickly mobilize the poor and hired laborers and become the leaders and backbone of the movement.

　　迅速组织冬季生产
    为普遍开展冬季生产运动，太行三专署再次号召，迅速把群众发动起来，组织到冬季生产中去，并提出以下几点：
    第一：面向群众，打破等待思想，这是我区目前开展冬季生产的主要关键。各级领导干部，当前普遍存在一个思想问题，即把群众补歉渡荒，积极要求冬季生产的要求撇开，而在那里等待；或认为今冬是以复查为主，生产时间不长，或只是结合问题等非群众观点的看法。从各县、市的领导来看，对冬季生产有的至今尚未统一研究布置；有的虽曾布置了，但表现粗率一般；有的是领导上进行分工，把冬季生产，交给县联社、工商、银行等经济部门负责。还有满足于群众已有冬季生产习惯，或几个先进村的行动，而忽视对一般村的发动，也有因满足于个别村、户的耕三余一，而无视整个歉收对农民的威胁（尤其对于贫雇）。当前打破这些思想，清醒头脑，就成为开展运动的第一把锁钥。必须使所有干部充分认识今年冬季生产，比之往年更具有特殊意义，是防荒、发家、支援战争的保证，是整个农民尤其是贫雇的急切要求，不抓紧领导，是违反群众现实利益的。一些已行动起来的地方，如平顺沙底栈、长治南天河等地，抓紧领导，依托贫雇，运动就会很快发动起来。壶关十里小区，上月十日检查，八个村就有七个村没有开始冬纺，全小区还有二十三户贫雇，冬天穿不上棉衣，领导思想清醒后，马上发动群众，重订计划，运动很快开展。
    第二：马上动手，具体组织。（一）打破对旧做法的因循、固守，以及大而无当的计划或只号召不组织等错误做法，面向现实马上动手，进行具体组织工作。（二）因地、因时制宜，深入群众帮助群众创造与开辟一切有利生产的条件，解决副业生产上的问题（如生产盲目、运输无货、无回脚、土产销不出去等……），各级合作社在这方面尤须切实起到核心作用。部分地区已有新的发展和创造：如（一）产、运、销相结合，解决了土产无销路无脚可运问题，如潞城新开辟西线销路之后，在微子镇、河南店设立行站，组织群众把本地土产：柿子、花生、煤炭等，运往屯留换回粮食，再运粮到河南店，驮回食盐。黎城西井一带，也组织群众往武乡担柿子，换回炭煤。赚了钱也调剂了各个市场的供需问题。这里需要注意的是，各有关行站一定要密切联系，互通情报，否则仍难免于盲目。（二）与军工生产相结合，解决了工厂劳力供应的困难，群众也有利益可图，是一举两得。长治靠近工厂的村，已有不少和工厂订运煤炭、矿石、器材，获利很大，黎城在生产领导上，过去和工厂互不联系，以致工厂感到燃料供应困难，群众感到无脚可运，经最近县联社打通关系，双方便利。（三）群众中看大不看小的高利思想，必须随时解决。黎城霞庄经过算帐，大家明确了“吃在外省在家，日子长了也顶一宗大收入”，干部有这种思想的，更须彻底肃清，否则就会对组织群众生产，表现无信心没勇气。
    第三，迅速发放冬贷，解决贫雇生产困难。我区发放的二万万余元的巨额冬贷，历时一月，大部地区还没贷到贫雇手里，这不能不说是一个严重问题。冬贷发放这样慢，有两个原因，一是干部重视不够，动手配合不够，一是负责贷放的同志仍残留着过去贷款上的错误观点与做法，以致虽有新的贷款路线（贫雇路线），却不能很好贯彻下去，甚至发生严重错误：如黎城岭头村三户贫雇今春贷款九万元，伙买马一匹，最近转贷中，竟硬逼该户卖马还贷款。
    如何做到贷的快、贷的好呢？首先就要从贫雇着眼，重视今年冬贷，并协同银行、合作社同志，共同办理，要通过贫雇，贷给贫雇，彻底肃清违反阶级路线的老观点，纠正过去在发放贷款时，即先考虑能不能“还款”，和只管贷款而不组织其生产的错误观点。必须明确不仅要保证把贷款给贫雇同时还必须组织其生产，使贷款真正能起到扶植贫雇生产的作用，如此也才能把贷款与还贷的矛盾得到解决。在做法上，通过贫雇审查贷款户与贷款数，贷款多少以真正能解决其一部实际困难为原则，一般应较集中。必须以户为对象，过去集中贷给合作社或互助组的做法，是有问题的。
    另外利息问题也须经过贫雇讨论决定，村信用部经手的一般应以不超过银行原利率一倍为限。各县、区、村社的信用贷款部，应广泛吸收群众游资，活泼农村金融，为贫雇服务。总之必须具体解决贫雇资金的困难，才能把贫雇迅速发动起来，成为运动的带领者与中坚力量。
