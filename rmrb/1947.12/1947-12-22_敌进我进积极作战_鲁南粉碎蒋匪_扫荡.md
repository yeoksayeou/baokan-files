　　Lunan Crushes Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's "Mopping-up" Operation
　　[Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th] In Lunan, our army, employing the active tactic of "enemy advances, we advance," has crushed Chiang Kai-shek bandit's defensive "mopping-up" operation against our Zou (County), Teng (County), Si (Shui), and Ping (Yi) mountain regions, annihilating over 400 enemy soldiers. Starting on the 4th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek's 72nd Division, the remnants of the New 15th Brigade, two regiments of the Shandong Security 2nd Brigade, and the Zou County Security Regiment, totaling over 5,000 men, moved southeast from Teng County, Zou County, and Sishui. Our army immediately left a small force to block the enemy at Pingyi Town, completely crushing the support force of over 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits advancing on Zhongcun, killing or wounding over 50 enemy soldiers. The remainder of our strong forces then advanced into the heartland of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to fight. First, on the 5th, they swept away the Lianqingshan bandit gang west of the Teng (County) Cheng (Qian) road, capturing over 50 enemy soldiers. Then, taking advantage of the victory, they wedged into the Teng Zou Ping plain on the east side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, forcing the Xiangcheng stronghold to retreat, completely annihilating the newly recruited township office of Tengdong, and on the 10th night, they approached the Sidong area, capturing the important town of Bianqiao in one fell swoop, completely annihilating over 300 defending enemies, threatening Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Sishui City. On the 14th night, they again raided the enemy stronghold in Zhongcun, inflicting heavy casualties. The enemy who invaded our mountain area was forced to flee in panic, and the "mopping-up" operation was crushed.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th] The Luzhong Local Corps carried out mopping-up operations in western Xintai and Mengyin, on the borders of Linqu and Changle, and struck at Chiang Kai-shek bandits who ventured out to loot in November, fighting a total of 212 battles and annihilating 2,697 enemy soldiers, including 1,281 enemy main forces and local bandits and puppet troops captured alive. They captured 21 strongholds including Gongli, and forced the retreat from 8 strongholds including Yanglou. They seized 11 heavy machine guns, 1 mortar, 362 rifles and pistols, and 18,000 rounds of ammunition of various types.
