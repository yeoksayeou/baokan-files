Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th – Since the beginning of winter, the people's armed forces in southern Jiangsu have actively launched a struggle against "encirclement and suppression." According to consolidated reports from Shanghai newspapers: Chiang Kai-shek's troops in southern Jiangsu, fearing the winter offensive of the people's armed forces, began "winter defense" as early as November 1st in areas such as Suzhou. In this area, police officers are stationed in double posts, "Self-Defense Forces" patrol day and night, and household registrations are checked at any time. Martial law is enforced in both urban and rural areas from 12:00 midnight to 6:00 AM the next morning. In Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian and other places, joint "winter defense" is being implemented. Kunshan, Yu (Changshu), Wu (Suzhou), and Tai (Cang) counties established a "Joint Suppression Command" as early as late September, frequently blocking land and water traffic, and conducting large-scale zonal inspections and searches. However, the people's armed forces, under the cover of the masses, are dispersed, assembled, mobile and free, carrying out anti-"encirclement and suppression" and anti-"winter defense" struggles everywhere. For example, in the Baimajian area of Wu County (i.e. Suzhou) on the south side of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the people's armed forces are constantly active. The people's armed forces in other areas frequently take the initiative to attack, carrying out anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggles everywhere. On October 25th, a detachment of Chiang Kai-shek's "Self-Defense Force" from Xiasu Town, Seventh District, Changzhou, was dispatched to "encircle and suppress" the area. When they reached Siqiao, they were suddenly attacked by the ambushing people's armed forces. The people's armed forces, with only eight or nine people, killed five Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, wounded two, and captured Xu Xiaochao, the leader of the bandit detachment. By the time bandit reinforcements arrived, the people's armed forces had already safely transferred. This "encirclement and suppression" was thus crushed. On the 29th of the same month, a squad of Chiang Kai-shek's security forces from Wu County, carrying one machine gun and ten rifles, went to Kongjiazhai, at the junction of Wu, Yu, and Kun counties, to check household registrations. They were surrounded by forty or fifty ambushing members of the people's armed forces, who fired at the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers with Thompson submachine guns and rifles. The fierce battle lasted for an hour, wounding one bandit. The people's armed forces used a rotation tactic, fighting and retreating. Finally, when bandit reinforcements arrived, the people's armed forces had already dispersed without a trace. Due to the continuous heroic and mobile attacks by the people's armed forces, Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and suppression" in southern Jiangsu has been greatly hit.

　　人民武装冬季出击苏南蒋匪城乡戒严
    【新华社陕北十九日电】苏南人民武装入冬以来积极展开反“清剿”斗争。综合沪报消息：苏南蒋匪畏惧人民武装之冬季出击，苏州等地早于十一月一日起即开始“冬防”。在此一地区，警察均站双岗，“自卫队”日夜巡逻，并随时抽查户口，不论城乡每日自晚十二时至次晨六时均实行戒严。在上海、南汇、奉贤等地，更实行联合“冬防”。昆（山）、虞（常熟）、吴（苏州）、太（仓）四县，早于九月下旬即成立“四县联剿指挥所”，经常封锁水陆交通，并进行大规模分区检查搜索，但人民武装则在群众掩护下，分散集合机动自如，到处进行反“清剿”、反“冬防”斗争。如京沪线南侧吴县（即苏州）白马涧一带，人民武装不断活动。其他地区人民武装经常主动出击，到处进行反“清剿”斗争。十月二十五日常州七区夏墅镇之蒋匪“自卫队”一分队出动“清剿”，行至寺桥，突遭预伏之人民武装袭击，人民武装仅以八、九人击毙蒋匪五人，伤二人，并将匪分队长许啸潮俘去，待匪援兵赶至，人民武装早已安全转移，此次“清剿”遂被粉碎。同月二十九日吴县蒋匪保安队一个班携机枪一挺，步枪十枝至吴、虞、昆三县交界处孔家宅抽查户口，亦为预伏之人民武装四、五十人所包围，并以汤姆机枪和步枪向蒋匪射击，激战达一小时之久，伤匪一名，人民武装以车轮战法且战且退，最后当匪援军赶至时，人民武装早已分散无踪。由于人民武装不断英勇机动出击，苏南蒋匪之“清剿”已受很大打击。
