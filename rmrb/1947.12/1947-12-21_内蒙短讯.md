Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, December 14th:

　　▲On November 26th, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government resolved to change Wangyemiao Street into a city, renaming it "Ulanhot," and appointed Zhang Ze as mayor. The city currently has over 1,460 stores and stalls, including the four major commercial centers of Dazhong, Heping, Shengli, and Northeast, each with over a thousand shops.
    ▲Over thirty lamas from the Gacha New Temple in the Rear Banner of West Keke have all returned home to engage in production. Liberated peasants are moving into the temple houses one after another. The local farmers' association is planning to open small shops and woodworking factories to engage in cooperative production.
    ▲Medical work in Inner Mongolia is developing day by day. In addition to the Inner Mongolia Hospital, a new Infectious Disease Hospital, the Arxan Hot Springs Sanatorium, the Hygiene Technology Research Institute, a Medical Equipment School, a Medical Worker Training School, and a United Hospital have recently been established.
    ▲The Hulunbuir Inner Mongolia Youth League has recently reorganized its organization, established a study system, and begun to study revolutionary worldview, national issues, social development history, Inner Mongolia issues, etc. The Zha Banner Youth League has also greatly developed its membership among farmers in the mass work of the past two months.
    ▲The Women's Association of Dongxin Ailitun in Mu Banner is very active. They participate in the farmers' armed team to stand guard and keep watch, and after the autumn harvest, they cooperate with the farmers' association in the treasure-digging campaign, undertaking the work of delivering intelligence.
    ▲After the masses in the Central Banner of West Keke struggled against Chiang Kai-shek's special agents Deleger, Song Jia, and others, they held an exhibition of the fruits of victory. The audience flocked to it from morning to night, reaching three thousand people on the first day of opening.
    ▲Since the masses of Shuanglong Village in Yi Banner launched the struggle last month, thirteen landlord households in the entire village have been struggled against, exposing gold and silver worth more than 5 million yuan. The masses have exchanged this fruit for grain to solve the winter famine. The poor and hired peasants of the village have now formed twelve production teams to engage in production such as firewood gathering, reed cutting, and fishing.
