    Qin County Bank Loans Five Million
    To Help Poor Military and Cadre Dependents with Production
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 15th] The Qin County branch of the Taiyue Bank has issued loans of five million yuan to help military and cadre dependents overcome difficulties in winter production. On October 30, the Qin County Party Committee convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various organs and districts to study the winter production problems of military and cadre dependents. In order to relieve the worries of soldiers at the front and cadres going south, allowing them to serve the people with peace of mind, it was decided to allocate five million yuan from the county bank as loans to help military and cadre dependents overcome their winter production difficulties. The funds were specifically allocated at one million yuan per district, focusing on solving the production difficulties of impoverished military and cadre dependents.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 15th] In order to vigorously promote the winter production campaign, the Yuebei Prefectural Committee and Administrative Office, in addition to distributing the 125,000 yuan in bonuses allocated by the Administrative Office to various counties, have also decided to make eleven large brocade banners. These will be awarded to production models at the conclusion of the winter production campaign next February. At the same time, a circular has been issued to all counties, calling on each district to implement the "rely on the poor" line in winter production and to increase livestock and collect firewood and manure in winter spinning and weaving and transportation. It also calls for the three counties along the Baijin Line to make significant achievements in organizing refugees for production in Mansiao (medicinal materials) and Pingyao and Jiexiu, and to strive to become model districts for winter production. Each district is called upon to identify model households and model individuals, each county to identify model villages, and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office to identify model districts. Winter production bonuses have already been distributed to the counties.
