Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th. The "Self-Defense News" of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces Headquarters recently published an editorial entitled "Build Several Hundred Thousand Reserve Troops Well," pointing out that in just over a month, rear military regions have organized a powerful reserve force of several hundred thousand young, strong, and well-equipped soldiers, conducting planned training and achieving considerable results and experience. This reflects the great victory of the forward units in annihilating more than 69,000 enemies in the 50 days of the autumn offensive. The newspaper emphasized: In order not to be satisfied with the existing achievements, each military region should make better efforts in the future. The most important issue to pay attention to at present is to intensify the training of cadres, ideology, and work style while training soldiers. In the past month, some units have found that the enthusiasm of some cadres lags behind that of the soldiers, and some coaching methods cannot meet the needs of the vast number of liberated soldiers. In management and education, there are even phenomena of beating, scolding, sarcasm, and a lack of concern for the soldiers. The growth of this phenomenon will form a serious warlord style, which must be prevented and corrected in time to avoid corrupting good soldiers. Therefore, each region must conduct strict screening of cadres. Those who come from landlord or rich peasant backgrounds and intentionally disrupt military discipline should be purged; those who lack ideological awareness or have degenerated should be intensified transformation, and they must also be subject to disciplinary sanctions. The editorial pointed out that neglecting leadership responsibility and underestimating the strength of the masses in troop training are both mistakes and constitute a bureaucratic and warlord leadership line, which should be resolutely opposed. The correct mass line must rely on the masses and combine leadership with the masses. At the same time, in cultivating role models, it is also necessary to prevent some comrades from treating the cultivation of role models as creating records, exaggerating individual outstanding achievements into general achievements, and using them as examples for reporting achievements, resulting in irresponsible, false achievements deceiving superiors, and the bad style of championism. The editorial finally called on all military regions to devote all efforts to building several hundred thousand powerful reserve forces to enhance the strength of the great counter-offensive.

　　东北组成强大后备军
    民主联军总部“自卫报”强调指出：
    加紧练干部以免把好兵带坏
    【新华社东北八日电】东北民主联军总部“自卫报”顷以“好好建设若干万后备军”为题发表社论，指出后方各军区于一个多月中，即组织了若干万以上年青力壮、装备齐全的强大后备军，进行有计划的训练，已取得不少成绩和经验，这和前方各部队在秋季攻势五十天内歼敌六万九千余人的伟大胜利，互相辉映。该报强调指出：为了不满足于现有的成绩，各军区今后应作更好的努力。当前必须注意的问题，首先是与练兵同时加紧练干部、练思想和练作风。在过去一个月中，某些部队已经发现若干干部的积极性落后于战士，某些教练方式亦不能满足于广大翻身战士的要求，在管教上甚至采取打骂讥讽和不关心战士的现象，此种现象的滋长将形成严重的军阀主义作风，必须及时防止和纠正，以免把好兵带坏。因此各地区必须进行严格的审查干部，如属于地主、富农出身而有意破坏军队纪律者，应加以清洗；如属于思想上的缺乏自觉和蜕化者，则应加紧改造，同样亦须受纪律的制裁。社论指出练兵中放松领导的责任，与轻视群众的力量均属错误，是官僚主义与军阀主义的领导路线，应该坚决反对。正确的群众路线必须是依靠群众，并使领导与群众相结合。同时在培养典型中，亦须防止有些同志把培养典型作为创造纪录，把个别突出的成绩夸大为一般，作为报告成绩的范例，造成对人民不负责任假冒成绩欺骗上级，与锦标主义的恶劣作风。社论最后号召各军区应以全力建设若干万强大后备军，以增强大反攻力量。
