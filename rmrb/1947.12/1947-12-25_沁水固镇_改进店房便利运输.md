Taiyue, December 23rd (from our newspaper) The masses in Qingshui Guzhen, along the main road, have opened mule and horse inns and restaurants to facilitate transportation for the passing masses. Since the beginning of November, the village has expanded from one mule and horse inn to eight, and from three restaurants to six. In addition, six more stalls selling soup and snacks have been added. On the 2nd of this month, the transportation masses from Yangcheng raised concerns to the innkeepers about the high prices, the cold rooms, and the lack of straw on the kang (sleeping platform). Personnel from the passing troops also felt that the inn prices were too high. Upon hearing these reflections, the village production committee convened a meeting of the mule and horse inn and restaurant personnel on the 5th, corrected the purely profit-driven perspective, and demanded convenience for both hosts and guests. They also established a leadership organization to enable the inns to exchange experiences at any time. At the same time, there were too many full-time laborers in the mule and horse inns and restaurants, so it was decided to extract a portion of them to engage in transportation. Currently, all the inns and restaurants have launched a service competition to serve the passing transportation masses, constantly listening to the reflections of the transportation masses along the way, and immediately making improvements.

　　沁水固镇
  　改进店房便利运输
    【本报太岳二十三日电】沁水固镇群众，沿大道开设骡马店与饭铺，以利来往群众运输。该村自十一月初起，已由一座骡马店发展为八座，三座饭铺发展六座，另外又增加六家卖汤饭小食的，本月二日阳城运输群众，向店主人提出店价太高、屋子不暖、炕上无草，来往部队人员也感店价太贵，该村生产委员会听到这些反映，便于五日召开沿路骡马店与饭铺人员开会，纠正单纯营利观点，要求主客两方便，并建立领导组织，使各店随时交流经验。同时骡马店与饭铺的全劳力太多，决定抽出一部分人来进行运输，现各店、铺皆展开为来往运输群众服务竞赛，经常倾听沿途运输群众的反映，即时加以改进。
