　　【Report from Jilu豫 [冀鲁豫] on the 20th of this month】 Wenshang victoriously persisted in the struggle in the hinterland, continuously smashing enemy "encirclement and suppression" operations for three months, and recovering vast villages. In late September, the enemy concentrated approximately four divisions of troops to impose a strict blockade on the canal and the banks of Dongping Lake, setting up a fortress every twenty steps. From then on, Wenshang lost contact with the sub-district. However, the people of Wenshang were not intimidated by the difficulties. Instead, under the enemy's blockade, division, "encirclement and suppression," and "mopping-up" operations, they fought hard for three months, finally defeating the enemy and strengthening themselves.

　　After the sudden change in the situation, all cadres in the county immediately carried out a general mobilization, recognizing the enemy's attempt to divide the eastern area of the canal, prevent our large army from advancing eastward, protect the Jinpu Railway, and defend Jinan. After the blockade and division, they were bound to cooperate with local reactionaries to carry out a longer-term "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up." Therefore, the entire county immediately carried out ideological and organizational preparations for resisting "mopping-up" operations and persisting in the struggle. The leadership also clearly pointed out: "Persisting in the area is unshakeable. Only advance, do not retreat. Struggle leads to life, not struggling leads to death. Fight and break through all difficulties. As long as we persist, we will surely win." The three days after the enemy began the "mopping-up" operations completely proved this point. The Security Defence Teams and Armed Work Teams widely launched ambushes. The first, fifth, and sixth districts all advanced into the enemy's rear and launched political offensives, making the local reactionaries afraid to harass us alone and forcing them to retreat to the vicinity of the city. The Sixth District Armed Work Team broke the Wenshang Highway telegraph lines three times, cutting a total of more than six hundred catties of wires. After half a month of intense struggle, overcoming all difficulties, the confidence in resolutely persisting was further enhanced and consolidated.

　　While guarding the front door, they also seized the gaps to conduct land reform re-investigations. The tense situation quickly changed. The enemy's main force, the 72nd and 84th Divisions, were forced to move away, and the 32nd Division was redeployed. The local reactionary Zhang Hansan was replaced, and the "new county magistrate" took office. Seizing this opportunity, they launched a fierce offensive against the enemy, expanding the area and conducting re-investigations. The First and Fifth Districts once repelled bandits and puppet troops who were looting grain from five villages. The Sixth District Armed Work Team broke the Wenshang Highway four times again, collecting hundreds of catties of telegraph wires. The area was expanded, with the First District developing to more than fifty villages, the Fifth District to a hundred villages, the Sixth District largely recovered, and other districts also making progress. In terms of the major re-investigation, first, more than fifty cadres from county and district agencies were organized. After two or three days of research, they corrected the ideological deviation that "guerrillas cannot re-investigate land distribution" and clarified the peasant line. In the initial stage of the action, more than two thousand poor peasants were organized in more than fifty villages and were given land and floating wealth (reaching seven or eight hundred catties of grain per household).

　　The enemy's continuous "mopping-up" operations were all smashed by us. Just as we were conducting the re-investigation, the enemy's main force, two battalions, cooperated with more than two hundred local reactionaries and advanced towards our Fifth and Sixth Districts in two routes. The militias of the two districts, while ambushing, also organized mobile forces to insert themselves into the enemy's rear and fight guerrilla warfare, forcing the enemy's main force to quickly retreat back to the city. On the front, seizing this opportunity, the Gao Tingfu unit of the local reactionaries was largely eliminated in the battle of ××, killing, wounding, and capturing more than fifty enemy soldiers. Since then, the enemy's arrogance has been greatly reduced, and our districts have taken the opportunity to expand propaganda. The Sixth District held a conference of more than eight hundred people. Then, the "mopping-up" operation led by the 15th Brigade of the 73rd Division began again, with a total of about three thousand people, launching a joint attack on various parts of eastern Wenshang. Our cadres and militiamen mobilized and dispersed, and immediately organized again the next day to fight hard with the enemy. This brutal "mopping-up" operation not only did not push us out, but made our fighting spirit even stronger. All districts organized all forces to launch an offensive against the enemy; armed struggle was combined with propaganda to expose the enemy's rumors and deceptions. The Fifth District also took the opportunity to hold a conference of more than two thousand people, with gongs and drums resounding everywhere, setting off earth-shattering roars. Under such a widespread offensive, the mass struggle sentiment after the "mopping-up" operation quickly rose. At present, the entire county is actively improving district teams and replenishing brigades, carrying out work in the marginal areas, and expanding the liberated areas.

　　汶上人民英勇苦斗三个月
  　迫敌退守县城附近
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】汶上胜利坚持腹地斗争，三月来连续粉碎敌“清剿”，收复广大村庄。九月下旬，敌集中约四个师的兵力对运河及东平湖岸进行了严密封锁，每二十步远设堡垒一处。从此，汶上就与分区失掉联系。但汶上人民没有被困难所吓倒，而在敌封锁分割“清剿”“扫荡”下，经三个月来的苦斗，终于打败了敌人，壮大了自己。
    在情况突然变化后，全县干部立即作了总动员，认清了敌人分割运河东部地区、阻我大军东进，掩护津浦路、保卫济南的企图，封锁分割后，势必配合土顽进行较长期的“清剿”“扫荡”。因此，全县立即进行了反“扫荡”、坚持斗争的思想与组织准备，领导上又肯定指出：“坚持地区是肯定不移的。只有前进，不可后退。斗争则生，不斗则死。战斗起来，冲破一切难关，只要坚持，就一定会胜利。”敌开始“扫荡”后的三天，就完全证明了这一点。保田队、武工队广泛开展起阻击战，一、五、六区，都挺进到敌后，并展开政治攻势，使土顽不敢单独出扰，都退到城附近。六区武工队三破汶公路电线，共割六百余斤电线。如此半月的紧张斗争，克服了一切困难，坚决坚持的信心更加提高与巩固。
    前边把好大门，后边抓紧空隙进行土改复查，一度紧张的情况很快就起了变化。敌主力七二师、八四师被迫调走，卅二师换防，土顽张汉三撤换，“新县官”上任，抓紧这一时机，猛烈向敌展开攻势，扩大地区，进行复查。一、五区曾打退五村抢粮伪匪，六区武工队又四破汶公路，收割电线上百斤，扩大地区计一区发展到五十余村、五区百村、六区大部恢复，其他区均有发展。在大复查方面，首先组织了县区各机关干部五十余人，经过两三天的研究，纠正了“游击不能复查分田”的思想偏向，明确了贫农路线。行动的初期，有五十余村组织了两千多贫农，分得了土地浮财（每户达七、八百斤粮食）。
    敌连续“扫荡”均被我粉碎，我正进行复查之际，敌主力两个营配合土顽二百余人，分两路又向我五、六区进犯。该两区民兵一面阻击、一面组织机动力量，插到敌后打麻雀战，迫使敌主力很快退回城内。正面抓住这一时机，在××一仗将土顽高廷甫部大部消灭，毙伤俘敌五十余人。自此，敌气焰大降，我各区就乘机扩大宣传，六区召开八百余人的大会。接着敌七三师十五旅为主的“扫荡”又开始，共约三千余人，分头向我东汶各地合击。我干部民兵机动分散，第二天又立即组织起来，再与敌苦斗。这样残酷“扫荡”不但没有把我们压出去，反使我斗志更加坚强了。各区又组织一切力量，向敌展开攻势；武装斗争结合宣传，揭破敌造谣欺骗。五区又趁机召开二千余人大会，到处锣鼓喧天，掀起了震天的怒吼。在这样的普遍攻势下，反“扫荡”后的群众斗争情绪迅速高涨。目前全县正在积极健全区队与补充大队，开展边沿区工作，扩大解放区。
