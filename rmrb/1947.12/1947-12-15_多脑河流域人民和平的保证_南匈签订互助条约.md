Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Budapest dispatch: Following the signing of the twenty-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between South and Bulgaria, South and Hungary signed a similar twenty-year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance on the 8th. The treaty was signed by Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito and Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés in person after Marshal Tito led a South government delegation to the Hungarian capital on the 6th. The purpose of the treaty is to jointly defend the security, independence and territorial integrity of the two countries, and to strengthen the existing friendly relations between the two countries. The main contents of the treaty stipulate: (1) If one of the contracting parties is subjected to aggression by Germany or other third countries, the other contracting party shall immediately provide military and all other assistance. (2) Neither contracting party shall participate in or take any alliance or action aimed at opposing the other contracting party. (3) The two countries will further strengthen their economic, cultural and other cooperation. In addition, the treaty has an addendum stipulating that the treaty shall not infringe upon the obligations of the contracting parties to third countries, and shall be implemented in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. The treaty is valid for twenty years, and may be extended for five years if the contracting parties do not declare its termination before the expiry date, and may be extended again. It shall take effect as soon as the instruments of ratification are exchanged in Belgrade by the two countries. After the signing was completed, Marshal Tito held a press conference at the South Embassy. When answering a question from an Associated Press reporter, he said that Yugoslavia would soon sign similar treaties with Romania and Poland. On the day before the treaty was signed, when Tito met with Dinnyés, he emphasized in his speech: "The South-Hungarian treaty is enough to prove that the so-called 'Slavic bloc' is nonsense. Hungary is not a Slavic nation, but the difference in nationality does not prevent the two countries from establishing the deepest friendship in all fields." Dinnyés solemnly pointed out that "the South-Hungarian treaty will guarantee peace for the people of the Danube River Basin." Tito and his party returned to South on the evening of the 8th.

    多脑河流域人民和平的保证
    南匈签订互助条约
    【新华社陕北十一日电】布达佩斯讯：继签订南保二十年友好合作条约之后，南匈又于八日签订同样之二十年友好合作互助条约。该约乃南斯拉夫总理铁托元帅于六日率南政府代表团抵达匈京后，与匈总理丁尼斯亲行签订者。缔约目的在共同防卫两国安全独立与领土完整，并加强两国现存友好关系。条约主要内容规定：（一）如缔约国一方受德国或其他第三国之侵略时，缔约国之另一方应立即予以军事上及其他一切之援助。（二）缔约国任一方不得参加或采取旨在反对缔约国另一方之同盟或行动。（三）两国进一步加强彼此间经济、文化及其他各方面之合作。此外，条约并有附款，规定该约不得侵害缔约国对第三国所负之义务，并须本联合国宪章之精神履行之。条约有效期定为二十年，如期满前缔约国不予以宣告废除，得延长五年，并得再延长之。一俟两国批准书在贝尔格莱德换约后，即行生效。铁托元帅在签字完成以后，即假南大使馆举行记者招待会，于答合众社记者问时，表示南斯拉夫即将与罗马尼亚及波兰签订类似之条约。条约签字前一日，铁托拜会丁尼斯时，曾于其致辞中强调：“南匈条约足以证明所谓‘斯拉夫集团’之说实属无稽。匈牙利固非斯拉夫民族，然民族之不同并不妨碍两国在一切领域中建立最深厚之友谊。”丁尼斯则郑重指出“南匈条约将为多脑河流域人民和平之保证”。铁托等一行业于八日晚返回南国。
