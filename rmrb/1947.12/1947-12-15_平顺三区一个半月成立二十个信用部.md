    In Pingshun Third District, due to reduced harvests, the average yield for the entire district this year is only thirty to forty percent of a normal year. The task placed on the shoulders of all district cadres is how to lead the masses through the winter and spring famine. To this end, the leaders of the Third District, after research, determined that in addition to specifically organizing mass production, the urgent need was to solve the problem of production capital for the masses. Relying solely on bank loans would not meet the production needs of the masses, and the only solution was to organize idle funds from the masses and establish credit cooperatives. Therefore, at the summary meeting of political directors, village chiefs, and cooperative directors on autumn harvest, autumn planting, and winter production preparation in the Third District, specific arrangements and research were conducted, and the slogan "Collect small amounts to make a whole, turn dead assets into living assets" was put forward. After this arrangement was implemented, from mid-October to the end of November, in one and a half months, twenty credit cooperatives were organized (there was one before), organizing 5,810,950 yuan of funds from the masses. Now all twenty-one credit cooperatives have opened, and the emancipated peasants are actively engaged in production by borrowing money from the credit cooperatives. Zhang Lusheng, an emancipated peasant from Doukou, said after borrowing 15,000 yuan from the credit cooperative: "Our group planned in the autumn to send out three laborers to engage in small-scale trading, but because we didn't have the capital, we only sent one. Now that the credit cooperative is organized and we can borrow money, it's very convenient. Today I borrowed the money, and tomorrow my group can send three people to Shexian to carry salt and to Changzhi to carry tobacco." (Yue Zhigang)

    平顺三区一个半月成立二十个信用部
    【本报平顺讯】三区减收，全区今年平均只有三成到四成的年景；给全区干部放在肩上的任务，是如何领导群众渡过今冬明春的灾荒。为此，在三区的领导上研究，除具体去组织群众生产外，迫切需要解决的是群众的生产资本问题，这一问题的解决，光靠银行贷款是不能满足群众生产需要的，解决办法只有组织群众游资，成立信用部。为此，三区在政治主任、村长、合作社长总结秋收秋耕准备冬季生产会上，专作了布置和研究，提出了“由零集整，死物变活物”的口号，此一布置下去以后，十月中旬到十一月底一个半月中，已组织起二十个信用部（以前有一个），组织了群众资金五百八十一万零九百五十元。现二十一个信用部都已开张，翻身农民都到信用部贷上款积极的进行起生产来。豆口翻身农民张路生到信用部贷到一万五千元款后说：“我组秋天就计划抽出三个劳力去担挑做小买卖，只因没本只抽出一个去了，现组织起信用部，能贷款，这可便利了，今天贷上了款，明天我组就可让三个人出去到涉县担盐、长治担烟去。”（岳志刚）
