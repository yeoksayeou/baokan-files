Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 18th: TASS, Athens: The Greek Democratic Army radio station broadcast an article by General Secretary Zachariadis of the Greek Communist Party on the Greek political situation, forcefully stating: "The crisis of the new Athens fascist government has matured. The maturation of the crisis is due to the complete failure of the 'appeasement' policy. The new offensive of the government army, which Sophoulis boasted about, has been declared a failure due to the severe blows of the Democratic Army. At the same time, the Athens government's economic plan has also suffered a disastrous defeat, thus arousing a new wave of popular anger and resistance. All of this has forced the government to frantically oppose the Greek people." Zachariadis also ruthlessly exposed the insidious plots of American and British imperialism to save their lackeys from ruin, stating: The US and Britain want to paralyze the National Liberation Front and make it unguarded, and to crack down on the revolutionary movement, especially the revolutionary movement in the cities. To this end, they are establishing a compromise government that includes the participation of the National Liberation Front. Zachariadis firmly stated: "Although American and British imperialism and their lackeys are trying to extinguish the democratic movement, the development of the democratic movement is still expanding day by day. The establishment of a free Greek democratic provisional government is only a matter of days." Zachariadis concluded with confidence in victory: "Now we are not isolated. The democratic movements of the whole world are standing on our side. The people of Western Europe are also fighting with us, and they have experienced valuable experience in dealing with American imperialism. At present, our democratic people are full of determination to win victory. Although we will suffer sacrifices in the struggle, the results of these sacrifices will produce the true democracy of the people." (Note: Under the leadership of Zachariadis, the Greek Communist Party today enjoys extremely high prestige among the Greek people. It is the organizer and leader of the Greek people's great liberation war for independence and freedom, and currently has 400,000 party members, accounting for more than 5.7% of the country's population.)
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 16th: Athens: George Yannoulis, leader of the Democratic Army in the liberated area of Kastoria, Greece, recently sent an open letter to the traitorous former Minister of Defense of the fascist government, Delamigous, denouncing his heinous crimes of betraying the country and persecuting democrats, and sternly rejected the traitors' despicable attempts to buy off patriots with "amnesty," high positions, gold, and overseas studies. He expressed the noble spirit of unyielding integrity, saying: "You only have the right to pardon the criminals of the nation, not the loyal patriots who shed blood for the freedom and territorial integrity of our motherland. We will never expect 'amnesty' in the form of gifts. We must resolutely fight until the National Liberation Front has decisively and completely participated in the organization of the government before we lay down our weapons. This government must disarm the right-wing groups, must remove traitors from government institutions, expel all foreign occupation forces, and implement absolutely reliable free elections. Now the strength of the Democratic Army is growing stronger and stronger, and the people's movement is expanding. We will completely eliminate not only the traitorous party, but also all domestic or foreign enemies of the people. The day is coming soon when those who beg for amnesty will be you fascist royalist dogs, national criminals, and executioners."

    希共总书记查沙雅狄斯宣称
    希腊民主政府即将建立
    雅典法西斯政府危机已成熟
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社雅典讯：希腊民主军无线电台广播希共总书记查沙雅狄斯论希腊政局一文，力称：“雅典法西斯新政府的危机已经成熟。危机的成熟是由于‘绥靖’政策已遭全部失败。索福利斯所大吹大擂的政府军的新攻势，由于民主军的严重打击而宣告失败。同时雅典政府的经济计划亦遭惨败，因而引起人民愤怒与反抗的新浪潮。所有这一切，都迫使政府疯狂地反对希腊人民”。查氏并无情揭露美英帝国主义为挽救其从仆危亡所施之奸险阴谋称：美英欲使民族阵线麻痹而不加警惕，并打击革命运动，特别是城市中的革命运动。为此建立容纳民族解放阵线参加的妥协政府。查氏坚称：“虽然美英帝国主义及其从仆们，力图扑灭民主运动，但民主运动的发展仍日益扩大，自由希腊民主临时政府的建立，已是今后数日内的事情了”。查氏于结语中充满胜利信心地说：“现在我们并不是孤立的，全世界的民主运动都站在我们这一方面，西欧人民也和我们一起斗争，他们已经体验过和美帝国主义打交道的宝贵经验。目前，我们民主人民充满了争取胜利的决心，虽然在斗争中将遭受牺牲，但这些牺牲的结果，将产生人民的真正民主”。（按在查沙雅狄斯领导下的希共，今天在希腊人民中威信极高，它是希腊人民争取独立与自由的伟大解放战争底组织者与领导者，现拥有党员四十万，占全国人口百分之五点七强。）
    【新华社陕北十六日电】雅典讯：希腊卡斯托里亚解放区民主军领袖乔治·雅努里斯，日前曾致法西斯政府前国防部长国贼德拉米古斯公开信一件，痛斥其卖国求荣，迫害民主人士之滔天罪行，并严词拒绝国贼们以“大赦”、高位、黄金、留学来收买爱国者的卑劣企图。他表现了坚贞不屈的崇高精神说：“你有权赦免的只是民族的罪人，而不是为着我们祖国的自由和领土完整而流血的忠诚爱国志士们。我们决不期望以礼物为形式的‘大赦’，我们要坚决作战到民族解放阵线有决定性地完全参加组织政府时，才放下武器。这一政府一定要解除右派集团的武装，一定要把卖国贼从政府机构里清除出去，驱逐一切外国占领军，实行绝对可靠的自由选举。现在民主军的力量一天天壮大起来，人民运动正在扩大。我们非但要把卖国贼党，而且要把所有国产或舶来的人民敌人完全消灭。那日子已快到了，那时乞求大赦的将是你们这类法西斯保皇党恶狗、民族罪人与刽子手。”
