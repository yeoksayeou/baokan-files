Anlan Conference Communication No. 4
Heroines on the Yellow River
Jun Qian

On the third day of the Anlan Conference, the reporter interviewed Zhao Guijin and Long Fengying, well-known heroines on the Yellow River. These two comrades, both just thirty years old, possessed the healthy bodies of peasants, their faces displaying smiles of victory. Zhao Guijin is a female party member from Zhoumiao in the third district of Kunwu, serving as an instructor in the village. When repairing the Jin embankment, she mobilized people at a village meeting, saying, "Now the Yellow River is about to flood, to prevent it from breaching, everyone, men and women, must go to build the embankment." The next day, Zhao Guijin led twenty or thirty men and women to the Jin embankment. The men asked the women to boil water and cook, but they insisted on pushing carts. The story of women pushing carts spread on the Jin embankment, and the liberated peasants defending the Yellow River launched a great competition. In addition to preparing meals for more than ten people, this female hero would dig soil whenever she had time. She once challenged Gao Wenliang, pushing more than twenty carts of soil in one go. The enthusiasm of this female hero for repairing the embankment infected the dike workers of Sandaipai Village, completing the seven-day task in four days. When the reporter asked about her family affairs, she told the reporter with an almost tearful expression, "My whole family of five relies on selling sesame cakes to make a living. I went to Shanxi at the age of eight and got married at the age of ten. My husband's family had only one and a half mu of land, and we didn't have enough to eat, often stripping elm leaves from trees." During the famine of 1943 and under the oppression of the traitors, her husband died, leaving behind two children. After the village was liberated, life improved, and she served as the chairwoman of the women's association for two years, and then as an instructor. The female hero Long Fengying is even stronger than Zhao Guijin. She is skilled at planting and harrowing land, and once cut four mu of sorghum with her father in one day, and could carry a hundred catties of grain for a hundred li. She is from Weimiao Village in the first district of Kunwu. Weimiao Village is a village near the river, located on the north side of the embankment. Repairing the embankment was unprecedented for the riverside villages. The liberated area under the leadership of the Communist Party ended the situation of feudal division, and the masses of Weimiao Village, led by Long Fengying, automatically went to the embankment. She pushed a cart of soil, each cart weighing more than two hundred catties, pushing more than twenty-four carts in one go. Under her influence, a large number of women in the first district flocked to the embankment. The women's army crowded the soil piles below the Jin embankment, shouting, "Long Fengying, I'll race you!" and "I'll race you!" This female hero on the Jin embankment set up a challenge. If anyone was not actively pushing soil, she would say, "Come, race me, dare you?" She served as a squad leader on the embankment, and the work of the villagers in Weimiao Village was completed early.

    安澜大会通讯之四
    黄河上的女英雄
    君谦
    安澜大会的第三日，记者访问了黄河上出名的女英雄赵贵金与龙凤英。这两个不过三十岁的女同志，具备着农民的健康身体，脸上浮现着胜利后的微笑。赵贵金是昆吾三区周庙的女党员，在村中担任指导员。修金堤时，她在村民大会上动员说：“现在黄水大泛快来，为防备黄河开口子，不管男女都要去打堤。”第二天，赵贵金就领着二、三十个男女上金堤了，男人们叫她几个妇女烧水作饭，她们却坚决要推车子，金堤上传开了妇女推土车的故事，于是金堤上捍卫黄河的翻身农民们，掀起了大竞赛。这位女英雄除了不误十多个人的饭外，一有空就去挖土，她曾向高文良挑过战，她一回推过二十多车子土。这个妇女英雄的修堤热情，感染了三周徘村的堤工，七天的任务四天完成。此次记者问她的家事，她带着几乎落泪的样子向记者说：“我全家五口人，全靠卖烧饼过生活，八岁时下山西，十岁结了婚，婆家亩半地，没饭吃，常到树上勒榆叶。”在四三年灾荒和汉奸的欺压下，她丈夫死去了，撇下了两个孩子，她村里解放后，日子过好了，当了二年妇会长，又当了指导员。女英雄龙凤英，她比赵贵金更健壮一些，她有耩地耙地的好本事，曾与父亲一天砍过四亩高粱，能扛一百斤粮食走一百里路。她是昆吾一区韦庙人，韦庙村是临河村，在堤的北面，临河村修堤是历史上没有的事，共产党领导的解放区结束了封建分割的局面，韦村的群众由龙凤英率领自动上堤了，她推着一辆土车子，每车都推二百多斤，一会推过二十四车子。在她影响下，一区大批妇女都拥上堤来了，金堤下面土堆上拥滚着娘子军，这里嚷着：“龙凤英，我给你赛赛！”那里也喊着：“我给你赛赛！”金堤上这位女英雄，立下了擂台，假如谁推土不积极，她就说：“来，和我赛赛，你敢不？”她在堤上当了小队长，韦庙村上的工早早的就完成了。
