　　Implement Equivalent Distribution of Profits to Develop Textile Mutual Aid

In recent years, there have been few new creations regarding the organization of textile mutual aid, equivalent value, and profit-sharing systems in the development of the textile movement. This also shows that we have not paid enough attention to this aspect in the past, which has affected the enthusiasm and technical improvement of women in textile work. The effectiveness of textile production has also been considerably affected. Looking at the development of textiles in various areas of the Taihang region, with the exception of counties like Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Yuanshi, Neiqiu, Huolu, Shahe, and Lincheng in the First District, and Linxian, Wu'an, and Cixian in the Fifth District, the supply of cloth for clothing is largely unable to meet demand in most counties. On the one hand, this is a problem of tool improvement, but mainly it is because textile mutual aid has not been well organized, and correct equivalent value and profit-sharing have not been implemented, which has affected development. Now is the period of the winter production campaign. If we cannot thoroughly study the organization of textile mutual aid and implement correct and reasonable systems of equivalent value and profit-sharing in the area of women's textile work, it will hinder the progress of the movement and prevent women from fully developing their enthusiasm.

　　Shahe Cejing has paid attention to this issue in textile production. In the past, the organization of textile production was mostly based on lamp oil mutual aid and simple exchange of labor. Although there was equivalent value, it was not fair and reasonable (weaving two zhang of cloth for one jin of cotton). After careful study and discussion, it was decided to organize textile labor as shareholding mutual aid and stipulate a reasonable system of equivalent value and profit-sharing. For example: 1. Regarding equivalent value in textile mutual aid: (1) Everyone first evaluates a sample as a standard. Spinning first-class thread, seven liang equals one work point; second-class thread, nine liang equals one work point. (2) The work point conversion between spinning and weaving is: weaving first-class thread cloth, one and a half jin equals one work point; weaving second-class thread cloth, two jin equals one work point. (3) Beating [cotton] first-class thread, one jin four liang equals one work point; second-class thread, one and a half jin equals one work point. (4) Other odd jobs are also converted to work points: for example, twisting thread, first-class thread, three jin twelve liang equals one work point; second-class thread, four jin equals one work point; twisting thread ends, first-class thread, one and a half jin, second-class thread, two jin equals one work point. (5) Sizing thread (regardless of class), four jin equals one work point. (6) Most cloth printing requires three people, and work points are calculated based on the average time spent. Combing cotton requires three people, each counted as one shift. (7) Setting up the loom frame and installing the loom are counted as one shift. (8) In textile labor exchange, spinning half a jin of fine, even thread, with neat and flat cloth edges, can be exchanged for one and a half jin of cloth. 2. Regarding profit-sharing: Profits are distributed within the group according to work points.

　　This method of organizing textile mutual aid with labor shareholding, equivalent value, and profit-sharing plays a significant role in the development of the textile movement. According to the masses in the area, the benefits of this labor shareholding method are: (1) Flexibility and convenience: Women can participate in mutual aid by doing work anytime and anywhere, and odd jobs can add up to a full work point. (2) Those who can spin spin, those who can weave weave, and each is specialized, which naturally improves skills. (3) Profit-sharing according to work points increases textile enthusiasm and increases output. In addition, profit-sharing between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is stipulated (generally a 40/60 split), which strengthens family unity and enhances the status of women. This organizational form of labor shareholding and profit-sharing according to work points can be used as a reference for various regions to further develop the textile movement. (Lian Yishan)

### 实行等价分红发展纺织互助

　　实行等价分红发展纺织互助
    几年来发展纺织运动中，关于组织纺织互助、等价、分红等制度的新创造，还不多见，这也说明了我们已往对这一方面注意不很够，因而影响了妇女纺织积极性和技术的提高。从纺织成效上看，也受到相当影响。就行太各地区纺织发展上看，除一分区之高邑、赞皇、元氏、内邱、获鹿、沙河、临城，五分区之林县、武安、磁县等数县外，穿用布匹大部县份是供不应求。一方面固然是工具改良上的问题，但主要还是因为没有很好组织纺织互助和没有实行正确的等价与分红，致发展上受到了影响。现正是冬季生产运动时期，妇女纺织方面，若不能很好研究组织纺织互助，和实行正确而合理的等价、分红制度，将会使运动进展上受到阻碍，不能发挥妇女们的积极性。
    沙河册井，纺织中注意了这一问题。过去在组织纺织上，多是灯油互助和简单的变工，虽有等价，但不公平合理（织二丈布纺一斤花）。经过很细致的研究讨论，议决组织纺织劳力入股互助办法，并规定出合理的等价、分红制度。如：一、纺织互助等价方面：（１）大家先评定出样子作标准，纺头等线七两顶一个工，二等线九两顶一个工。（２）纺和织的折工是织头等线布斤半顶一个工，织二等线布二斤顶一个工。（３）打＠头等线一斤四两顶一工，二等斤半顶一工。（４）其余零活也都折工：如拐线，头等线三斤十二两顶一工，二等线四斤顶一工：拐线头，头等线一斤半、二等线二斤顶一工。（５）浆线（不分等）四斤顶一工。（６）经印布大部是三人，平均按时间计晌顶工。掏头需三人，每人均按一晌算。（７）闯柱和安机合按一晌算。（８）纺织变工上，纺半斤换斤半布（线要细、匀，布边要齐整和面平）。二、在分红方面：组内按工批红。
    这样的劳力入股、等价、分红的办法，组织纺织互助，对纺织运动发展起很大作用。据该地群众反映，这种劳力入股的办法好处有：（一）灵活方便：妇女们随时随地可以做活参加互助，零工顶了整工。（二）会纺的纺，会织的织，各样都是专门，自然可以提高技术。（三）按工分红，提高了纺织情绪，而又增多了产量。此外并规定了婆媳分红（一般都是四、六分红），密切了家庭团结，提高了妇女地位。这种劳力入股、按工分红的组织形式，各地可参考研究，更进一步的把纺织运动开展起来。（连一山）
