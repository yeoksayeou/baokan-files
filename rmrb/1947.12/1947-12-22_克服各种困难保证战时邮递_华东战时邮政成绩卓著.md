　　Overcoming Various Difficulties to Ensure Wartime Postal Delivery
  　Remarkable Achievements of the East China Wartime Postal Service

　　The postal work in East China closely coordinates with the needs of the war, overcoming various difficulties, and has achieved remarkable results in the past year. As early as the Lunan and Laimu campaigns in central Shandong this spring, under the slogan of "Everything for the Front," postal workers tried their best to overcome the difficulties caused by the mobility of the troops, so that thousands of soldiers could receive mail and read newspapers in a timely manner. After Lunan, Binan, Luzhong, and other places were temporarily turned into guerrilla areas, the post offices in various counties organized armed transportation teams, cooperating with the armed work teams to travel back and forth behind enemy lines day and night to deliver mail and newspapers. In August, Lunan opened a 300-mile postal trunk line from Cangshan (newly established county) directly to Zou and Teng, traversing the mountainous area, delivering newspapers to remote areas behind enemy lines, and inspiring the confidence of the military and civilians behind enemy lines to persist in the struggle. The Cangshan County Post Office has become a powerful assistant in the military struggle, leading troops back to Lunan to annihilate the enemy and completing eight guiding missions. Postal transport comrades from the Linyi County Post Office in Binhai often acted as guides for the armed work teams. The bureau also adopted the method of armed delivery and ensuring that the newspapers never stopped even if the people did, so that readers in the suburbs could read the newspapers every other day. The Zichuan Armed Transportation Team in central Shandong successfully opened the connection between central Shandong and Bohai, carrying mail through the Zhangbo and Jiaoji Railways, the Xiaofu, Xiaoqing, and Lianghe three highways, and more than a hundred miles of enemy-occupied areas under the urgent situation of the enemy's strict blockade, and escorted a large number of cadres to transfer safely. Within 1,000 square miles of the Eleventh Sub-district on the coast of the Yellow Sea in northern Jiangsu, the Huanghai Daily published by the sub-district could be seen on the same day. In the arduous postal delivery work, countless heroes and models who were resolute, brave, and loyal to their duties emerged. Wang Yuanzhu, a postman in Huaihai, ran day and night without fear of hardship. Once, he carried a confidential express letter through the blockade line and was discovered by the enemy. He swallowed the letter into his stomach. After being arrested, he was severely tortured by the enemy but never uttered a word. After escaping, his wounds were still there, and he was busy on the Huaihai Plain again. Comrade Ling Wenqi from Linyi County Post Office relied on the masses to independently persist in his work, maintaining contact with readers on both sides of the Yi River and behind Chiang's lines, and won the honorary title of hero in distributing the Party newspaper. Comrade Zhu Rongchang, director of the Haiyang County Post Office, persisted in his work in the border area and was surrounded by the enemy. He immediately resisted bravely. When his ammunition ran out and there was no support, he burned documents, clothes, and fought the enemy in hand-to-hand combat until his death. The Provincial Post Office posthumously awarded him a special merit. Yan Shunming, a postal worker at the Binbei Central Station, took off his clothes to wrap documents on rainy days, and was soaked in the rain naked. Comrade Xu Qimu from the Southern County Post Office in Ju County was once swept away by a rapid current for half a mile while crossing a river. Fortunately, he was rescued by a worker, and he continued to work actively after the incident. According to statistics from five counties in Binnan, Zhuting (formerly Ganyu), Tancheng, and Linyi, more than 350,000 copies of newspapers and propaganda materials were distributed and posted in enemy areas in the past year, disintegrating more than 200 members of Chiang Kai-shek's "Returning Home Corps." In the past six months, during the Ling Wenqi campaign, 90% of the comrades have made contributions.
