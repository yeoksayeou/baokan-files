The Landlord and the Red Army Soldier
  Soviet Folktale

　　A landlord, after altering his appearance, disguised himself as a poor peasant and infiltrated a collective farm, eventually becoming the chairman of the collective farm. Nobody knew he was a landlord. But a demobilized Red Army soldier named Zhula returned to his hometown from the Red Army. Many years ago, he had been a shepherd for this landlord, and he immediately recognized this cunning wolf. However, Zhula couldn't do anything about this landlord in the village.

　　Zhula went to the city. The landlord, thinking his former shepherd was planning to deal with him, got into a car and also went to the city. He quickly caught up with Zhula, who was walking, and mocked him:

　　"Keep walking, keep walking, I will reach my destination before you. I will report you, and people will believe me, the chairman of the collective farm."

　　But Zhula walked on, whistling and sneering.

　　The landlord thought in the city: "This place is too close to my hometown; if people investigate, my background will be known. I should go all the way to Moscow. That's far from the Kazakh (a place in Central Asia of Russia, now a republic of the Soviet Union) wilderness, where no one knows the real truth. I'll file a lawsuit against Zhula and have him thrown in jail."

　　With this thought, the landlord boarded a plane and flew to Moscow. But Zhula walked on, whistling and sneering. The landlord flew, Zhula walked, and both laughed derisively. But Zhula was much smarter. While the landlord was sitting on the plane flying to Moscow, Zhula came to the city and went straight to the radio station. When he got there, he shouted loudly, and Stalin heard him.

　　"What do you want, Zhula!" Stalin asked him.

　　Then Zhula told him all about the landlord's background.

　　"Alright," Stalin said, "we'll prepare a gift for your landlord."

　　As soon as the landlord flew to Moscow, the moment he got off the plane, a hoe was handed to him, and he was driven to a very cold border area to dig irrigation canals to bring water and warmth there.

　　But when Zhula returned to his hometown, he was elected as the chairman of the collective farm. Because of his efforts, this collective farm is now the best one in the region.

　　大地主和红军战士
  　苏联民间故事
    一个大地主，把自己的面具一涂改，冒充着贫农混进了集体农场，就成了集体农场的主席了。谁也不知道他是个大地主。可是一个复员的红军士兵朱拉，从红军里回到自己的故乡了。好多年以前，他给这地主当过牧童，于是即刻就认出了这个狡猾的豺狼。可是朱拉在村里对这大地主连一点办法也没有。
    朱拉就到城里去，大地主想着他从前的牧童要准备收拾他的，坐上汽车，也就进城去了。他很快的赶上步行的朱拉，就嘲笑着说：
    “爬吧，爬吧，我要比你早达到目的呢。我去告你，而且人家对我，对集体农场的主席，不会不相信哩。”
    可是朱拉走着，走着，口里只是在啸着和冷笑着。
    大地主到城里想道：“这儿距家乡很近；或者人家一调查的话，我的底细就都知道了。我不如一直到莫斯科去吧。那距哈萨克（俄国中亚细亚地名，现为苏维埃联邦的一个共和国）旷野远着哩，那儿谁也不晓得实在的底细。我去告朱拉一状，就把他下到狱里了。”
    大地主这样一想，坐上飞机，就往莫斯科飞去了。可是朱拉走着，走着，口里只在啸着和冷笑着。大地主飞着，朱拉走着，两个都在嘲笑着。可是朱拉竟聪明得多了。当大地主坐在了飞机上，往莫斯科飞的时候，朱拉来到城里，一直去到无线电台上。到了那儿，就大声的，大声的叫着，斯大林就听见他了。
    “你要什么呢？朱拉！”斯大林问他说。
    那时朱拉就把大地主一切的底细都告诉他了。
    “好吧，”斯大林说，“我们给你的大地主预备着一份礼物。”
    大地主一飞到莫斯科，当他一下了飞机，把一张锄交到他手里，把他赶到很冷的边区里，为着往那儿通水和温暖起见，就叫他去挖灌渠去了。
    可是当朱拉一回到家乡的时候，就把他举为集体农场主席了，因为他的努力，这一个集体农场，现在就成了本区里最好的一个农场了。
