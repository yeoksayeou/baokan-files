    Transport Grain for the Counter-Offensive and Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek
    Taihang Region Engages in Righteous Transport
    Lucheng Organizes Side-Hauling, Earning Over 40 Million Yuan in Silver

    [Report from our newspaper in Taihang, 9th] After being emancipated, the farmers of Taihang, responding to the call of the Administrative Office, are actively transporting grain for the counter-offensive. In Che Temple Village, Xiyang, with a total of 64 head of livestock and 94 laborers, they were assigned to carry and transport 10,820 jin. However, encouraged by the victory of the counter-offensive (especially the recapture of Shizhuang), old men and children all mobilized, exceeding the task by 1,028 jin, saving a total of 79 man-animal workdays. Dong Cunyang, an emancipated farmer from Qingcheng, Heshun, is already 55 years old. When mobilizing for grain transport, he was not assigned to go. He automatically sought out the cadres and said, "This is sending grain for the counter-offensive to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. I must go. What's the point of dividing the fruits if you don't defend them?" The cadres couldn't dissuade him, and considering his age, asked him to carry 40 jin. As a result, he carried 60 jin. When Huangniuti and Nanmazhuang in Lucheng transported grain to Zhengzi Town and Cao Village, the women, under the slogan "Three-inch feet play a role, transport grain as vanguards, all to defeat Old Chiang," organized more than 100 people to participate in grain transport. Generally, they could carry more than 30 jin. Many women with bound feet or older women whose physical strength was lacking, also voluntarily participated. In order to solve the problem of travel expenses for the grain transport workers, the county cooperative beforehand sent special personnel to Henan Shop in She County, Yangyi in Wu'an, and other places to solicit return trips, and earned from hauling 1,648,000 jin. Besides solving travel expenses, they also earned over 40 million yuan in silver. In terms of organizing the workers, Neiqiu, Ping順, and other places used base points or villages as units, organized into camps, companies, platoons, and squads, directly led by district or county cadres, and equipped with doctors (veterinarians and human doctors) to treat illnesses. Each group had security personnel responsible for inspecting and monitoring sabotage by bad people, truly achieving order and speed, and saving manpower. Another characteristic of this righteous transport is that the emancipated farmers in various places truly demonstrated the spirit that all farmers in the world are one family, and launched a movement of mutual love among the people. Along the way, each village set up workers' reception stations, with special personnel responsible for accommodation, meals, and drinking water; to save travel expenses for the workers, shops and restaurants in various places changed to selling yellow steamed bread and vegetable (rice) soup, so that the workers did not suffer any difficulties. For example, Lin County, according to its specific situation, established eight central stations, with the district head and district secretary serving as station chiefs, and equipped with a number of district cadres and county government staff, who were responsible for leading the village stations and solving the difficulties and problems of the workers. When Ma Shuiwang and other workers from Anle Village, Lucheng, stayed at the home of disabled soldier Feng Zhansheng in She County, Feng immediately cooked noodles, borrowed quilts, and carried water for the livestock, treating them like family, and firmly refused when the workers offered money. The masses of Huangyuancheng in Wu'an put forward the slogan "Livestock stay in the pen, people stay outside the yard," "Boil water and make soup, don't let comrades go hungry," and they did what they said, and everyone was in high spirits. The masses of the nine streets in Chengguan newly built four large troughs that could feed 40 head of livestock to entertain the grain transport livestock.

    太行全区大义运
    潞城组织捎回脚赚洋四千余万元
    【本报太行九日电】太行翻身农民，响应行署号召，积极运送反攻粮。昔阳车寺村，共牲口六十四头，劳力九十四个，按分应担、驮一万零八百二十斤，但在反攻胜利（特别是收复石庄）的鼓舞下，老汉、儿童齐动员，即超过任务一千零二十八斤，共省人畜工七十九个。和顺青城翻身农民董存羊，已五十五岁了，在动员运粮时没有让他去，他自动寻上干部说：“这是送反攻粮，是为了打倒蒋介石，我非去不行，分到果实自己不保卫叫谁保卫”？干部劝说不下，念他年老，让他担四十斤，结果他担了六十斤。潞城黄牛蹄、南马庄，往征子镇、曹庄运粮时，妇女们在“三抢起作用，运粮打先锋，都是为了打老蒋”的口号下，组织了一百余人参加运粮，一般都能扛到三十多斤，有许多小脚的或年老的妇女体力不沾，也都自动参加了。该县县联社为了解决运粮民工的盘费困难，在事前即派专人到涉县河南店、武安阳邑等地揽回脚，全县运粮大车二千九百九十六辆，驮驴一千头，拉、驮回脚一百六十四万八千斤，除解决盘费外，还赚洋四千余万元。在民工组织上，内邱、平顺等地是以基点或村为单位，编成营、连、排、班，区或县干部直接领导，并配医生（兽医、人医）看病，各小组有治安员，负责检查监视坏人的破坏，真正做到了有条不紊，来去迅速，节省民力。此次义运中其另一个特点是，各地翻身农民，真正表现了天下农民是一家的精神，展开了民爱民运动。在沿路各村皆设有民工招待站，住宿、吃饭、喝水均有专人负责招待；为了民工节省盘费，各地店房、饭铺，改卖黄蒸、菜（米）汤，使民工不受任何困难。如林县依具体情况，设立了八个中心站，区长、区书分任站长，并配有若干区干部及县府科员，分别领导村站，负责解决民工的困难与问题。潞城安乐村民工马水旺等人住到涉县城荣军冯占胜家里时，冯即赶面条、借被子、担水饮牲口，招待亲如一家人，民工们给钱时他坚辞不要。武安黄苑城群众提出：“牲口住圈，人不在院”，“烧水滚汤，不让同志们受饥喝”的口号，他们说到做到，大家情绪很高。城关九街群众，新盘了四个能喂四十个牲口的大槽，招待运粮牲口。
