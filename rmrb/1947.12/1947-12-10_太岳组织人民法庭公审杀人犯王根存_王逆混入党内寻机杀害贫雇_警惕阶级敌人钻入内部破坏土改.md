　　Taiyue Organizes People's Court to Publicly Try Murderer Wang Gencun
　　Wang, a Counter-Revolutionary, Infiltrates the Party Seeking Opportunities to Murder Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
　　Be Vigilant Against Class Enemies Infiltrating the Interior to Sabotage Land Reform
　　[Our Newspaper] Whoever tries to sabotage land reform and harm the people will be smashed to pieces. Wang Gencun, a class alien and local tyrant who infiltrated the Taiyue 4th Column, provoked internal struggles among peasants in Xiahexi Village, Jiyuan, where the station was stationed, brutally murdered three basic masses, tied up and beat county and district cadres, and insulted our party leaders. He has been publicly tried by the Taiyue People's Court, expelled from the Party and military, and handed over to the local people for execution. The criminal Wang Gencun was the deputy political instructor of the Taiyue 4th Column's station, a native of Nanchang Village, Changzi County, and is 28 years old. His father was one of the four major local tyrants in the village and had served as a puppet regiment commander. Wang himself had also served as the deputy head of the "Public Morality Corps" in the village. He infiltrated the army in 1939, consistently concealed his background, and sabotaged work. During the anti-traitor and grievance-airing campaign in 1945, Wang presided over a meeting of more than ten struggle targets in his home, beating to death the activist Sun Tianyou. When the masses of Beichang Village sent militiamen to detain his local tyrant uncle, Wang Gencun relied on his power to beat and insult them and disarmed the militiamen. After the land reform, he completely sided with his local tyrant family, sabotaging the masses' efforts to turn the tables. During the major campaign last November, the masses slightly struggled against his family, and he immediately wrote a letter to the village threatening them publicly. After returning, he cursed the cadres and masses, drove away the basic mass Sun Youming, sealed his door, and brought Song Liansheng, the son of a landlord from a neighboring village, and his brother-in-law (a rapist and bully) Li Tingzhu to the army, intending to cause greater damage to the revolution. This time, taking advantage of the absence of He Mingyuan, the station chief, he appeared as a cadre of our army, using the marriage dispute between Pan Xiaoqun of Xiahexi and Yang Xiaotao of Hong Village to provoke struggles between the masses of Xiahexi and Hong Village. Yang Xiaotao and Pan Xiaoqun were both basic masses from hired labor backgrounds, but Wang Gencun incited the masses of Xiahexi, saying, "The local tyrant Yang Xiaotao has snatched Pan Xiaoqun's wife. This is Pan Xiaoqun's problem, and it is also the problem of all of us in Xiahexi. You should all overthrow this local tyrant. Our 4th Column station will also help you." He said even more fiercely to the wounded and sick soldiers and communications personnel at the station: "What are we sacrificing our blood and lives for at the front? It is for the masses to turn the tables. Today, someone is preventing the masses from turning the tables. Is that okay with us?" On October 30th, Wang then ordered the station personnel to combine with the militia of Xiahexi to arrest people in Hong Village, firing guns and throwing grenades indiscriminately, causing panic among the masses. The village cadres fled to the district to ask for a decision. The district office communicated with him by telephone but was ineffective. On October 31st, Comrade Yang Chunpu, chairman of the district farmers' association, was sent to discuss a solution, but he harbored vengeful intentions. As soon as Comrade Yang arrived, he was detained and beaten, and forced to write a notice to convene meetings in various villages, and write a letter to Hong Village to have Yang Shuyi (a poor peasant who made a living by weaving baskets), the uncle of Yang Xiaotao, and Xiaotao's mother detained. On the third day, the cadres of Hong Village again sought out Zhai Liangchao, deputy director of the county party committee propaganda department, Chen Shiyao, deputy secretary of the sub-committee, Zhang Duo, the district chief, and other comrades. As soon as Wang Gencun met them, he provoked them, saying, "Yang Chunpu has already been detained here, and he has been slapped in the face." He insisted that Yang Xiaotao was a local tyrant and immediately forced them to convene a struggle meeting. Everyone introduced the details of the matter in detail and confirmed that Yang and others were indeed poor and hired peasants, but Wang Gencun hated such poor and hired families, so he surrounded Comrade Zhai and others, beat and insulted them, saying they were shielding local tyrants, beat them until their heads were bleeding, and then disarmed them and tied them up. At the same time, he coerced the masses to hold a meeting. The common people were frightened and looked at each other, eager to escape. Wang immediately fired shots with the communications personnel, shouting, "Shoot whoever runs away," and dragged Comrade Zhai and others, tied up and beaten, to the meeting place. Wang Gencun then announced the opening of the meeting, acting as chairman, first cursing Yang Xiaotao and the county and district cadres, and then announced the airing of grievances, first calling up the sixty-year-old Yang Shuyi, who was beaten to near death by the communications personnel. When Pan Xiaoqun's mother came out and cursed him, Wang immediately picked up a stone and smashed the old man's brains out. He then dragged out Yang Xiaotao and his mother, ordering the communications personnel to beat them and force them to confess that they had spent money to marry a wife and that the government had accepted bribes. When he could not force a result, Wang Gencun immediately ordered them to be beaten to death on the spot. After murdering them, he turned to the cadres, cursing, "You bad guys are big stone slabs, Chiang Kai-sheks, and spies. Don't say you are ministers and district chiefs, even if Chairman Mao obstructs the mass movement, he must be overthrown." He also beat and forced Comrade Zhai and others to confess and admit their mistakes. Fortunately, the masses and village cadres tried their best to cover them up, otherwise they would have all been poisoned.
　　Expelled from the Party and Military, Handed Over to the People for Execution
　　After the massacre, the entire district was shocked and angry. After investigation, the entire district organized a people's court on November 20th to publicly try the murderer. The 4th Column's garrison, the 8th Column's garrison, the military region's department, political department, directly affiliated organs, and more than 5,000 people near Yangcheng all came from afar to participate in the public trial. As soon as the murderer Wang Gencun entered the meeting place, the atmosphere was tense and激愤. When the trial began, the entire audience was silent. After the plaintiffs made their accusations, because the evidence was conclusive, Wang Gencun confessed to each charge without denial. At this time, the entire audience was so激动 that they could not restrain themselves and rushed to express their opinions. Comrades from the 4th Column said, "Wang Gencun has污辱ed our 4th Column. He must be handed over to the people of Jiyuan for public trial, his heart and liver dug out to comfort the dead!" Some said, "Notify all localities, find the Sun Youming who was forced to flee, and compensate him for his family property!" Some shouted, "Break his legs, cut off his ears!" Some shouted, "Strip off his military uniform!" At this point, the presiding judge, based on Wang Gencun's crimes and everyone's opinions, announced the charges: (1) Provoking internal struggles among peasants; (2) Instigating the beating to death of Yang Xiaotao's family of three; (3) Tying up and beating county and district cadres, sabotaging military-government and military-civilian relations. Therefore, the judgment was: (1) The 4th Column's garrison representative, on behalf of the Party Committee, to announce the expulsion of Wang Gencun from the Party, and on behalf of the column leaders to announce his expulsion from the military, and hand him over to the masses for execution. (2) Wang Gencun's father, relatives, etc., to be handed over to the local masses for handling. (3) The troops are responsible for cleansing Wang Gencun's brother-in-law Li Tingzhu and handing him over to the people of Changzi for handling. (4) The conference entrusted the Jiyuan County government to hand Wang Gencun over to the people of Jiyuan for execution.
