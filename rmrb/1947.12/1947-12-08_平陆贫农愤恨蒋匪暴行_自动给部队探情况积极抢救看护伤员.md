(Our newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch) Late news: When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits crossed the Yellow River to the north and extended their claws to the first district of Pinglu, the atrocities they committed were too numerous to describe. After Chiang Kai-shek's bandits fled, this reporter arrived with the army in villages such as Zhangcun, Xindian, and Miaodi in the first district, and what I saw was shocking. Piles of chicken feathers, pig bristles, and pig intestines being torn and eaten by dogs, cotton quilt covers, and torn clothes, as well as broken water tanks and basins, were everywhere on the streets. Countless doors and windows were burned down. In Xindian, the reporter saw that many pots and water urns were filled with the bandits' excrement and urine, and the grain was mixed with horse manure and garbage. Many pits were dug in the corners of the walls and on the kangs. According to the refugees, in a small shop in Yaotou Village, the only 30,000 yuan in banknotes, more than 70 jin of flour, and 200 mahua twists were all looted by the bandit army. All seven pigs, big and small, in the Nanguan Village mill were eaten. Most of the salt and wheat that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits seized were transported to Henan, and the rest were destroyed. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits severely tortured and killed the old people who did not have time to escape. The old Guan's wife in Xindian was caught and had her hair pulled out alive. Wang Quanzi, an old man from Nanguan Village, was forced to lead the bandits to Zhangcun and was also killed. The various atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits aroused the people's unparalleled hatred. Therefore, when our army attacked the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, they actively assisted in the battle. Wang Maba, a young poor peasant in Miaodi Village, voluntarily led the army. Whenever he reached the front line of the enemy, he would say to the troops, "Wait a minute, I'll go and scout the situation." Often bullets landed beside him; his family sent word for him to go back, but he sternly refused. During the tense battle, Sun Ruijin, a farmer from Miaodi, voluntarily rescued our wounded on the front line and sheltered them for several days. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandits retreated, he sent them back to their original units. Eight poor and hired peasant women who had escaped from Chengguan voluntarily cared for the wounded, cooked meals, and washed clothes. The hospital lacked cotton and cloth, and they immediately mobilized more than two jin of cotton and more than one zhang of cloth. Chen, a 57-year-old poor peasant woman from Yao Yan Village, gave her big rooster to the wounded to eat.

    【本报太岳五日电】迟到消息：蒋匪北渡黄河，魔爪伸向平陆一区时，所到之处，暴行多得没法说。记者于蒋匪溃逃后，随军到达一区张村、辛店、庙底等村，所见触目惊心。街道上一堆堆的鸡毛、猪毛，及被狗撕吃着的猪肠、棉被套子及撕烂的衣服，以及打碎的水缸、盆罐，到处全是。门板窗子被烧毁的不计其数。记者在辛店看到许多锅及水瓮中，被匪徒们拉了屎尿，粮食中掺着马粪垃圾，墙角下和炕上都被掘许多坑。据逃难的居民对记者说：窑头村一个小铺子里，仅有的三万元钞票、七十余斤面和二百根麻花，全部被匪军抢劫一空。南吴村粉坊的大小七口猪，全被吃光。蒋匪抢到的食盐和麦子，大部运往河南，余下的都被毁掉。蒋匪对来不及逃跑的老百姓，严刑拷打杀害，辛店老关媳妇被抓住，活活拔掉头发。南吴村王泉子老汉，被逼给匪军带路，到张村后也遭杀害。蒋匪种种暴行，激起了当地群众无比的仇恨。所以在我军进击蒋匪时，纷纷协助作战。庙底村青年贫农王马把，自动为军队领路，每到接敌前沿地区，便向部队说：“你们先等一下，我去探探情况。”常常子弹落在他的身旁；家里捎话让他回去，他严词拒绝。在紧张的战斗中，庙底农民孙瑞金，自动在火线上抢救我伤员，掩护数日，待蒋匪溃退后，又送返原部。城关逃出来的贫雇农妇女八人，自动看护伤员，作饭洗衣服。医院缺少棉花布匹，她们马上动员了二斤多棉花一丈余布。窑阎村五十七岁的贫农陈老太太，把自己一只大公鸡送给伤员吃。
