Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 4th: Moscow Radio broadcast an article by Masinu on December 1st commenting on Chiang Kai-shek's phony election. The article is as follows:

　　As expected, the so-called "general election" played by the Kuomintang has suffered a shameful bankruptcy. On the first day, newspapers published in the Kuomintang area, regardless of the authorities' orders and threats, refused to support this most blatant insult to democratic principles and the will of the people. Only a few of the most reactionary newspapers, such as *Peace Daily* (run by the Military Intelligence Bureau's secret service), *China Times* (run by the Youth Party), and the Kuomintang's official newspaper, *Central Daily News*, talked about this "general election." As for the voters, according to Reuters, the Chinese people are generally not interested in the "general election," and in many large cities, less than 10 percent of the people voted. Furthermore, according to a broadcast from Melbourne in Nanjing, November 23rd was the last day of the "general election." Although this day was a Sunday, when it was expected that a large number of people would vote, only 30 percent of the voters in Nanjing exercised their right to vote. If such an embarrassment occurred in Nanjing, the Kuomintang's capital, which is full of reactionary warlords, bureaucrats, and countless secret agents, what is there to say about the provinces? In order to save face, the reactionaries fabricated various explanations. A Reuters report is one of them. Semi-official sources pointed out that a large percentage of the population is illiterate, and used this as an excuse to explain the failure of the "general election." British and American reporters also stated that the Chinese people are generally not interested in the "general election." All of these statements do not accurately reflect the actual situation. They attempt to defend the bankrupt reactionaries by claiming that the people are politically apathetic. In reality, the bankruptcy of the Kuomintang reactionaries' "general election" is precisely due to the Chinese people's high level of political awareness. The majority of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas refused to participate in the "general election," turning it into a tool of political struggle in their hands. They used this method to express their attitude towards the Kuomintang, and to oppose the dictatorship of the reactionary Four Families and their policy of betraying national interests. This is a political boycott of the Kuomintang's "general election." Residents from all walks of life, regardless of social background or political affiliation, all patriotic elements and all democrats participated in this boycott. The Kuomintang's performance of this farce has done them a disservice. They have proven to the world that they have no mass base and are spurned even in the areas they control. Their deceptive tactics of so-called independent candidates cannot save them from bankruptcy, nor can they erase the impression that society has witnessed the complete absence of democratic parties and democratic groups. Democratic parties and democratic groups were declared illegal in advance, preventing them from campaigning against the "general election." As a double insurance, the Kuomintang preemptively arrested, secretly kidnapped, and shot patriotic elements—not only patriotic elements, but also those suspected of sympathizing with the democratic cause. However, these methods did not change the reactionaries' position in the "general election" in the slightest. On the contrary, the Kuomintang's preparations for the "general election" helped people expose the true nature of the deceptive propaganda of "democracy" and "constitutionalism," and helped those who had illusions in this regard shatter their illusions. While launching an open offensive against all democrats and those who showed even a little patriotism, the reactionaries also signed many agreements with American imperialists that enslaved the Chinese people. The Chinese people have never seen such humiliating treaties in their history, which even surpassed the most shameful treaties signed by Wang Jingwei and Japan. Such as the treaty on the stationing of U.S. troops in China and turning China into a U.S. military base, the so-called U.S. aid to China agreement, the agreement that completely handed over the control of China's entire national economy to the Americans, and the agreement on establishing U.S. leadership over China's national education. These treaties enslaving the Chinese people were all signed during the Kuomintang's "general election." This greatly helped people understand the truth. The most obvious and glaring fact is that the Kuomintang's "general election" was actually carried out under the conditions of American occupation in the Kuomintang areas. People are particularly clear that behind the Kuomintang reactionaries' performance of this fragile conspiracy of a "general election" lies the attempt to legitimize their traitorous deeds. Those Chinese people who once had illusions (who thought that it was possible to achieve peace and national rejuvenation under the current Kuomintang rule) have realized that their ideas were wrong. Those who honestly thought that they could reach some consensus with the reactionary authorities on the national democratic cause of peace and democratic rejuvenation have also realized that their ideas were wrong. All Chinese people with patriotic enthusiasm unanimously believe that there is no—and cannot be—a third way. And one of the most important results of the Kuomintang's "general election" is that all patriotic elements and democrats are more united than ever, joining the united camp of the patriotic democratic movement to work together to achieve peace and democracy, and to truly establish a democratic coalition government.

　　When the Kuomintang reactionaries performed their so-called "general election," the main slogan they put forward was the long-bankrupt "anti-communism." They called on the people to vote in favor of overthrowing the Communist Party, but the vast majority of residents in the Kuomintang area boycotted this reactionary election. This is because the vast majority of the Chinese people clearly recognize that the Kuomintang reactionaries have relied on Japanese and American imperialism for the past 20 years, using "anti-communism" as a pretext to carry out the treasonous act of opposing the people and selling out the motherland. The long-tested Chinese Communist Party has won the support of tens of millions of people. They have waged a struggle to defend the dignity and honor of the nation and against the American imperialist plan to enslave the Chinese people, and have strengthened their leading prestige in this struggle. All true patriotic elements are united around the CCP. Therefore, the so-called "election" played by the Kuomintang reactionaries and their masters, the American imperialists, under the false propaganda slogan of anti-communism, cannot but suffer bankruptcy.

　　The Kuomintang reactionaries' most blatant insult to democratic principles and the will of the people has made the democratic achievements in the liberated areas of China even more apparent to Chinese patriots. In the vast liberated areas of Northeast, Northwest, North China, and the Central Plains, it has been practically proven that under democratic conditions, it is possible to rapidly rejuvenate the country and to establish a truly democratic coalition government. There, truly free and truly democratic general elections have long been realized. The people's illiteracy does not prevent them from actively participating in the general election. Moreover, the democratic governments in the liberated areas have quickly eliminated this illiteracy. The facts form a sharp contrast: the residents in the liberated areas unanimously voted to elect their own people's regime; while the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas unanimously rose up to boycott the reactionary regime's "general election."

　　马西努指出中国人民唾弃伪选
    蒋匪骗局遭可耻破产
    我党保卫主权赢得人民信任
    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科电台一日广播马西努评蒋介石伪选一文，如下：
    正如人们所期待的，国民党所扮演的所谓“普选”遭到了可耻的破产。在第一天，在国民党区域里出版的报纸不顾当局的命令与威胁，而拒绝支持这种对民主原则和人民意志之最粗暴的侮辱，谈论此次“普选”的只有几家最反动的报纸，如和平日报（军统局特务办的）、中华时报（青年党办的）及国民党机关报中央日报。至于选民，据路透社报导：中国人民一般对于“普选”不感兴趣，在许多大城市中投票的人不到百分之十。再看墨尔钵从南京广播的消息：十一月二十三日是“普选”的最后一天，虽然这一天是星期日，曾经期待在这天将有大批的人投票，可是在南京只有百分之三十的选民，利用了自己的投票权。在充满反动军阀、官僚和无数秘密侦探的国民党首都南京，在这里都是这样的出丑，那么，在外省还有什么可说呢？为了想法子保持自己的面子，反动派伪造了各种解释，路透社消息就是其中的一种。半官方人士指出：由于不识字的人占了很大百分数。用这种借口企图解释“普选”失败的原因，英美记者还声明：中国人民一般对“普选”不感兴趣。所有这种说法，并不能确切的表明实际情况，他们企图以所谓人民对政治的消极态度来替破产的反动派作辩护，实际上国民党反动派“普选”的破产，正是由于中国人民有很高的政治觉悟性。国民党统治区大多数人民拒绝参加“普选”，成了人民手中的政治斗争工具，他们用这种办法表明自己对国民党的态度，用这种方法反对反动四大家族独裁，反对他们出卖民族利益的政策，这是对国民党“普选”的一种政治抵制。各界居民不分社会出身，不分党派，所有爱国分子与一切民主人士都参加了这种抵制。国民党用自己扮演的把戏替自己做了一种不好的效劳（事与愿违），他们已经向全世界证明了他们是没有任何群众基础的，他们甚至在自己统治区内都是被人唾弃了的人。他们用所谓独立候选人的欺骗手段，也挽救不了他们的破产，不能抹掉社会人士亲眼见到的完全没有民主政党和民主团体的印象。民主政党和民主团体已被事先宣布为非法，使他们没有法子进行反对“普选”的宣传，为了双层保险，国民党对爱国分子——不仅爱国分子，而且对那些对民主事业表有同情的嫌疑人都预先加以逮捕，秘密绑票和枪杀。可是这些办法也丝毫没有改变反动派在“普选”中的地位，而国民党对“普选”的这种准备，反帮助人们揭破了“民主”和“立宪”欺骗宣传的真正实质，帮助在这方面抱有幻想的人们打破了自己的幻想。反动派在对一切民主分子和稍许表现出有爱国精神的人举行公开进攻之同时，又与美帝国主义者签订了许多奴役中国人民的协定。中国人民在自己的历史上还没有看见过这样丧权辱国的协定，他们甚至超过了以前汪精卫和日本签订的那些最可耻的协定。如关于美军驻华和将中国变成美国军事根据地的条约，关于所谓美日援华协定，将中国全部国民经济的控制权完全交给美国人的协定，关于建立美对华国民教育之领导权的协定，这些奴役中国人民的条约，都是在国民党进行“普选”时期签订的。这大大帮助了人们对于事实真相的了解。最明显最刺眼的事实就是：国民党的“普选”，实际上是在国民党区域受美国侵占的条件下进行的，人们特别清楚在国民党反动派扮演这种阴谋脆弱的“普选”后面，掩盖着使自己的卖国勾当合法化的企图。那些曾经抱有幻想的中国人（就是以为在现今国民党的统治条件下，有可能达到和平与国家复兴的人），已经明白自己的这种想法是错误的了。那些曾经老老实实想着以为在为和平与民主复兴的全民民主事业上能够和反动当局取得某些一致意见的人，也明白了自己的这种想法是错误的了。凡是有热血的中国人，都一致认为没有——也不能有第三条道路。而国民党扮演“普选”的最主要结果之一就是：一切爱国分子及民主人士比任何时期都更加团结一致，加入了爱国民主运动的统一营垒，以便共同努力达到和平与民主，达到真正建立民主联合政府。
    国民党反动派在扮演其所谓“普选”时，提出的主要口号是早已破产了的所谓反对共产主义，他们号召人民投票赞成打倒共产党，可是国民党区内的广大居民抵制了这种反动的选举。因为中国广大人民清楚认识二十年来国民党反动派投靠日、美帝国主义，借“反对共产主义”名义进行反对人民出卖祖国的勾当。久经考验的中国共产党已得到了成千万人民的拥护，他们为着保卫民族的尊严和荣誉，进行了反对美国帝国主义奴役中国人民计划的斗争，并且加强了在这个斗争力量中之领导威信，一切真正的爱国分子，都在中共周围团结起来了。因国民党反动派与其主子——美帝国主义者在反对共产主义的虚伪宣传口号下扮演的所谓“选举”，不能不遭受破产。
    国民党反动派对民主原则、对人民的意志表现了最粗暴的侮辱，在中国爱国人士眼中更显示出了在中国解放区达到的民主收获。在东北、西北、华北及在中原广大的解放区域内，实际证明了在民主条件下有可能使国家迅速的复兴，证明能够建立真正的民主联合政府。在那里，早已实现了真正自由、真正民主的普选。人民的不识字，并不能阻碍他们的积极参加普选。而且解放区民主政府很迅速的消灭了这种不识字的现象。事实形成了一个鲜明的对照：在解放区域内的居民，一致投票选举自己的人民政权；而在国民党统治区的人民，则是一致起来抵制反动政权的“普选”。
