　　Hope that District and Village Cadres Pay Attention to Collecting Ancient Books and Paintings
To the Editor:
　　When passing through Wu'an, I visited the Wu'an People's Education Center and Library. I was surprised to see Zhuge Liang's "Former and Later Statements on Dispatching the Army" written in Yue Fei's own hand, Fang Guancheng's poetry criticism, and the labor-rich woodblock print "Gēng Zhī Tú" (Plowing and Weaving Picture), as well as various ancient paintings and calligraphy by Zheng Banqiao and others. According to several district and village cadres, during the mass movement, because some farmers could not understand ancient books and paintings, they burned many of them as firewood out of resentment, which I find very regrettable. Today, after seeing the People's Daily's suggestion that everyone pay attention to preserving ancient books and paintings, I earnestly hope that comrades participating in land reform work in various places will pay attention to collecting scattered and even incomplete ancient books and paintings in rural corners and send them to the government for preservation. This is very helpful for cultural work.

### 希望区村干部注意收集古书古画

　　希望区村干部注意收集古书古画编辑同志：
    路过武安，参观了武安民教馆和图书馆，意外地看到岳飞亲笔写的诸葛亮“前后出师表”，方观承的诗话和富有劳动意义的版画“耕织图”，及郑板桥等古画书法多种，据几位区村干部谈：在群运中，由于某些农民看不懂古书古画，一时愤恨，把许多古书古画都当柴火烧了，我觉得很可惜。今天看到人民日报号召大家注意保存古书古画的建议，我热切地希望各地参加土改工作的同志，把散失在农村角落里，即使是残缺不全的古书古画，随时注意收集起来，送交政府保存，这对于文化工作是很有帮助的。
