[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches from December 5th to 7th] The strike struggle of over two million French workers is intensifying. Workers are bravely fighting against the military police suppressing the strike, even leading to bloody struggles. On the 3rd, the General Confederation of Labor's National Strike Committee issued a communique, expressing satisfaction with the development of the French strike movement. The Strike Committee believes that "the government's policies and its obvious fear of the growing workers' movement have led the police to take terroristic actions and become increasingly reactionary." The Strike Committee declared that it is "prepared to assume all responsibilities arising from the current situation" and protested against Schuman's various acts of sabotage against the strike, infringement on freedom of the press, and the use of official newspapers to spread rumors and other heinous behaviors. The communique announced that the Strike Committee Central Committee decided to organize strike support committees to concentrate available materials for reasonable distribution, in order to further develop the movement to support the strikers. The Strike Committee emphasized that "the Strike Committee Central Committee is more convinced than ever of the strength of the workers' forces, and the great struggle for bread and freedom will surely be victorious. The Strike Committee attaches importance to the resolution of the executive committee of the National Federation of Government Employees to hold a general strike, considering it a sign of unity. The Strike Committee once again calls for expanding the strike in France."

The Paris Strike Committee strongly protested against Schuman's use of police force to take over Paris power stations and other reactionary measures to undermine the strike. The Paris Strike Committee declared that "90 percent of the workers in these power stations have expressed their willingness to strike by secret ballot." On the 3rd, the National Union of Shop Employees issued an order to its 250,000 members (excluding the food industry), demanding a strike on the 5th.

On the 5th, all workers in the French Riviera (southeastern France-Italy border) went on strike. Employees of the gas factory and electrical technicians in Brive, Correze province in the southwest, went on strike, and employees of "Air France" in Marseilles also joined the struggle. The National Federation of Government Employees decided on the 5th to conduct a two-day "warning strike" from the morning of the 8th to the evening of the 9th. After the order was issued, some civil servant federations stopped working from the morning of the 5th. The strike in North Africa is also expanding, with 80,000 people ceasing work in Algiers. A communique from the National Strike Committee stated that the number of strikers has not decreased, and the strikers are extremely determined. Although some enterprises and even some factory owner organizations have yielded to the workers' demands and the workers have temporarily resumed work, they remain united with the strikers.

Due to opposition to police interference and sabotage, striking workers across France have risen up to fight the police. A struggle between more than 2,000 workers at the Renault factory and the police resulted in three police officers being injured and one worker injured. Similar incidents also occurred in Marseilles, De Mogues, and Boulogne. A reporter for the newspaper *The Volunteer* reported on the 3rd that police in the departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais attempted to expel striking miners from the mines, with about 10,000 armed military police, accompanied by 25 tanks and armored vehicles, attacking the strike pickets in the mining areas. However, under the workers' resolute resistance, the military police only occupied the management department and failed to break the resistance of the strike pickets guarding the mines. Contrary to all official rumors, the newspaper stated that only 1,000 of the 134,000 miners in the departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais went down into the mines to work.

The struggle of strikers against the military police continues to expand, and bloody struggles have occurred in many cities, especially in southern France. An Associated Press dispatch on the 6th stated that "strikers in Saint-Étienne, an arms manufacturing center near Lyon, and Arles, fifty nautical miles from Marseilles, once occupied the entire city." The agency reported on the 5th that the situation in Marseilles, France's second largest city, which had been on strike for three weeks, was "alarming to the authorities. Strikers and police have repeatedly clashed there, paralyzing traffic in this major port, and strikers control most of the city's streets." On the 4th, strikers in Nice occupied the central post office. The police only regained control of the bureau after receiving significant reinforcements in the evening, but the next morning at 7:00 a.m., a large crowd again forced the police and "security forces" to withdraw. At 10:00 a.m., troops arrived by truck, and the demonstrators withdrew from the post office, but regrouped at the employment agency. During the battle with the police, twenty-one demonstrators were injured. The Nice Central Strike Committee decided to call a general strike in protest. The main post offices in Cannes and Antibes, near Nice, were also occupied by strikers. In Valence, despite the police's best efforts to obstruct and kill two workers, the strikers continued to occupy the train station. On the 5th, conflicts also occurred in Tulle, Clermont-Ferrand, and Grenoble. The conflict in Grenoble took place near the power station, which changed hands three times. Similar conflicts occurred in Yvoire, Roanne (west), and Toulon. The strikers in Albertville, according to an Associated Press dispatch on the 4th, "have occupied all public buildings except the city hall. The city is controlled by the strikers."

In the department of Nord in northern France, thousands of miners engaged in a fierce battle with police on the 4th, resulting in twenty police officers being injured. Strikers in Arras removed thirty feet of track at a railroad bend, resulting in the derailment of a mail train on the 3rd, killing and injuring twenty people. Clashes also occurred in Denain, Lens, and other places on the 5th. Strikers in Châteauroux and Bourges in central France also took "forceful action" (Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 6th).

　　法工人英勇抗击军警
    马赛要港罢工者控制大部分街道
    圣德田与阿尔工人一度占领全城
    【综合新华社五至七日电】法国工人阶级两百余万人的大罢工斗争，日趋深入。工人英勇抗击镇压罢工的军警，乃至演成流血斗争。三日总工会全国罢工委员会发表公报，对法国罢工运动的发展表示满意。罢委会认为：“政府的政策和它对于日益扩大的工人运动之明显的惧怕，使警察采取了恐怖行动，而愈来愈反动了”。罢委会宣称：它“准备担负起由现在局势所产生的一切责任”；并对舒曼当局各种破坏罢工及侵犯新闻自由，利用官方报纸散布谣言等穷凶极恶的行为提出抗议。公报宣布：罢委会中央决定组织罢工后援委员会，集中可用的物资作合理分配，以进一步开展声援罢工者的运动。罢委会强调称：“罢委会中央比往日更加确信工人力量之强大，争取面包与自由的巨大斗争，结果一定胜利。罢委会重视全国政府雇员联盟执委会举行总罢工的决议，认为是团结的表示。罢委会再次号召扩大法国的罢工。”
    巴黎罢工委员会对舒曼以警察强力接收巴黎各动力站，以及破坏罢工的反动措施，提出猛烈抗议。巴黎罢委会宣称：“这些动力站的工人，百分之九十都已以秘密投票方式表示他们愿意罢工的心意”。全国店员工会三日向其二十五万会员（粮食业除外）发出命令，要求于五日举行罢工。
    五日法国名胜地区里维耶拉（东南部法意边界）全体工人罢工，西南部科列兹省布里伏城之煤气工厂职工和电气技师举行罢工，马赛的“法兰西”航空公司职工亦参加斗争。全国政府雇员联盟五日决定，自八日晨至九日晚作两天“警告罢工”。命令发出后，某些公务员联合会则自五日晨起即停止工作。北非的罢工亦在扩大中，阿尔及尔有八万人停止工作。全国罢工委员会公报称：罢工人数并未减少，罢工者极为坚定。某些企业甚至某些厂主的组织屈服于工人要求后，工人虽暂时复工，但他们仍和罢工者团结一致。
    由于反对警察的干涉破坏，法国各地罢工工人奋起抗击警察。雷诺工厂工人两千余与警察斗争结果，使后者三名受伤，工人亦伤一名。类似的事件亦发生在马赛、德莫格、布隆格等地。义勇军报访员三日报导：警察在诺尔及加莱两省企图将罢工矿工自矿井中逐出，武装的军警约万人，并附坦克装甲车等二十五辆，向矿区罢工工人纠察队进攻，但是在工人坚决抵抗下，军警仅只占领了经理部门，而未能打破警戒矿场的罢工纠察队之抵抗。与一切官方谣言相反，该报称，诺尔与加莱两省十三万四千矿工中，仅有一千人走入矿井工作。
    罢工者对军警的斗争继续扩大，特别是法国南部许多城市发生了流血斗争。美联社六日电称：“里昂附近的军火制造中心圣德田和距马赛五十海里的阿尔之罢工者曾一度占领全城。”该社五日电称：三星期前即已罢工的法国第二大城马赛，其形势“令当局惊慌，该地罢工者与警察一再发生战斗，这一大港交通陷于停顿，罢工者控制了该城大部分街道。”四日，尼斯罢工者占领邮政总局，警察只在晚间获得大量增援后，始重占该局，但第二天清晨七时，大批群众又迫使警察和“保安队”撤退，十时，军队乘卡车到达，示威者遂撤出邮局，但复集结于职业介绍所。与警察战斗时，示威者二十一人受伤。尼斯中央罢工委员会乃决定号召总罢工，以示抗议。尼斯附近之坎城和安提柏之总邮局，也为罢工者所占领。在瓦棱斯，警察虽百般阻挠，并击毙两个工人，但罢工者仍继续占有火车站。五日，支勒蒙腓隆和格累诺布尔亦发生冲突。格累诺布尔的冲突在电力站附近进行，电力站曾三易其手。依伏利，罗尔（西部），土伦等城均有类似冲突发生。亚尔柏维尔城的罢工者，据美联社四日电称：“除市政府外，已占有一切公共建筑物。城市已为罢工者所控制。”
    在法国北部诺尔省数千矿工与警察四日曾发生激烈战斗，结果使二十名警察受伤。阿拉斯的罢工者将铁路转弯处的轨道拔去了三十英尺，结果使邮车于三日倾覆，死伤二十人。在代仑西安、伦兹等地五日亦发生冲突事件。在中部沙多卢与部尔日等地罢工者亦有“强有力行动”（法新社六日电）。
