　　Taiyue Administrative Office Instruction
　　Combine Winter Production with Winter Literacy Education
    [Our newspaper Taiyue Second Telegram] The Taiyue Administrative Office recently issued winter literacy instructions, defining the policy for this year's winter literacy program as serving the war and production. It emphasizes that winter literacy education should be combined with the winter production movement, and production education such as organizing transportation and accumulating fertilizer should be universally and deeply carried out within the winter literacy program. First, enable the masses to recognize the importance of this winter's production from the perspective of guaranteeing supply and enriching the material foundation for the great counter-offensive. Second, eliminate ideological obstacles to production among the masses, such as waiting for re-examination and not having time for production, in order to enhance the production enthusiasm of the masses. Third, publicize the various policies for developing and rewarding winter production, publicize production experience, exchange production technology, and commend production models. Turn the winter production slogan into the actual production actions of the masses. And through winter literacy education, organize and lead production, and solve practical problems. The organizational form of winter literacy education should be suitable for the production organization of the masses, creating flexible and diverse organizational forms and teaching methods, combining the organizational form of winter literacy education with the war participation teams, transportation teams, and textile groups, striving not to delay or minimize work delays, and seizing the spare time of the masses or the gaps in eating on the streets for teaching. Promote the good practice of fathers teaching sons, sons teaching fathers, and husbands and wives and brothers teaching each other. Correct the past practice of insisting on running winter literacy programs centrally in dispersed rural areas.

　　太岳行署指示
  　结合冬季生产进行冬学教育
    【本报太岳二日电】太岳行署顷发布冬学指示，确定今年冬学的方针是服务战争与生产，强调冬学教育要结合冬季生产运动，在冬学内普遍深入的进行组织运输、积肥等生产教育。第一、使群众从保障供应、充实大反攻物质基础的积极意义上来认识今冬生产的重要性。第二、扫除群众生产中的思想障碍。如等待复查、无暇生产等，以提高群众生产情绪。第三、宣传发展、奖励冬季生产的各种政策，宣传生产经验，交流生产技术，表扬生产模范。把冬季生产口号变为群众生产的实际行动。并通过冬学，组织领导生产，解决实际问题。冬学的组织形式，要适合群众的生产组织，创造灵活多样的组织形式和教学方法，将冬学的组织形式和参战队、运输队、纺织组相结合，力求不误或少误工，抓紧群众闲暇或街头吃饭的空隙，进行教学。发扬父教子、子教父、夫妻兄弟互教的优良风气。纠正过去分散的农村一定要集中办冬学的办法。
