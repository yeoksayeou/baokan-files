　　Wherever the communication trenches are dug, that place becomes a liberated area.
　　The people of Ye County actively dig trenches to trap the enemy.
    [Our Newspaper Taihang Dispatch, 22nd] In order to facilitate our army's operations, strengthen the economic blockade against the enemy, cut off transportation, increase the enemy's difficulty in seizing grain, encircle the isolated Chiang bandit forces in Anyang, and expand the liberated areas, the people of Ye County launched a campaign to dig communication trenches on the 27th of last month, under the cover of local armed forces and militia. In seven days, they completed hundreds of miles of communication trenches, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 50 Chiang bandits who came out to harass them, and seizing one machine gun and seven rifles. The Armed Work Team of the Third District buried landmines near the enemy's stronghold of Zhaoxian Village. Two enemies were killed as soon as they left the village, and they dared not go out again. The masses safely completed the task of digging trenches, exceeding seven miles. The Fourth District exceeded six miles in four days. The masses have great confidence in digging communication trenches, believing that it is a good way to protect grain and defend their homes. More than 1,400 people in the Third District, after celebrating the completion of the communication trenches on the first day of this month, the next day, eleven villages organized themselves to watch the trench entrances and stand guard. The masses in Shadong Village, who lived in Shaxi Village, moved back quickly after hearing that their communication trenches had also been dug. Everyone believes that "wherever the trenches are dug, that place becomes a liberated area." The masses in He Village, Cui Bridge, Liangyin and other villages actively dug trenches, requesting that the trenches be dug to their villages. The people of Hong Village were not afraid of the cold, took off their coats and worked bare-backed. The youth of Rong Village formed a commando team, charging wherever the soil was hard. According to statistics: on average, each person dug one zhang per day. When the County Command summarized on the 5th of this month, it called for further developing war preparations, road destruction, terrain transformation, guarding and sentry duty, explosion campaigns, and preventing paralysis in coordination with the communication trench operations. It also pointed out that persisting on the spot is not about holding the line rigidly; communication trenches are not for confronting the enemy head-on, but for making it easier for us to actively attack behind enemy lines.

　　交通沟挖到了那里那里就变成解放区
  　邺县群众积极挖沟困敌
    【本报太行二十二日电】邺县群众为便利我军作战，加强对敌经济封锁，切断交通，增加敌抢粮困难，围困孤守安阳蒋匪，扩大解放区。上月二十七日全县在地方武装及民兵出击掩护下，掀起挖交通沟运动，七天中完成了纵横数百里的交通沟，并毙伤俘出扰蒋匪五十余名，缴机枪一挺、步枪七支。三区武工队将地雷埋在敌据点招贤村边，敌出村即被炸死二人，再不敢外出，群众安全地完成了挖沟任务，并超过七里，四区四天超过六里。群众对挖交通沟信心极高，认为是护粮保家的好办法，三区千四百余群众，于本月一日庆祝完成交通沟大会后，次日即有十一个村群众，组织起来看沟口、站岗放哨。住在沙西村之沙东群众听到自己也挖好了交通壕，很快搬回去。大家认为：“挖到那里，那里就成了解放区”。何庄、崔桥、梁因等村群众，纷纷自动挖沟，要求把沟挖到他村。洪村群众不怕寒冷，脱了袄光着膀子干。荣村青年组成突击队，那里土硬到那里突击。据统计：平均每人每日挖到一丈。县指挥部于本月五日总结时，号召配合交通沟作战，进一步开展备战、破路、改造地形、站岗放哨、爆炸运动、防止麻痹。并指出：就地坚持，并不是固守阵地；交通沟不是对敌硬顶，是为了更便于我主动出击敌后。
