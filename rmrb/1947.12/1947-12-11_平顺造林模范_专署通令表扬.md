    Pingshun Afforestation Model
    Special Commissioner's Office Issues Circular of Commendation
    [This newspaper's report] The Taihang Third Special Commissioner's Office issued a circular commending Pingshun County, a model in planting trees and afforestation. The county planted a total of 530,000 trees in the spring. With a population of 100,600, that's an average of five trees per person, of which 65% survived. In the autumn, one million walnut trees and mulberry cuttings were planted, exceeding the original plan by 45%. The county sowed peach, apricot, pine, and cypress seeds on 28,760 mu of both newly and previously restricted mountains. Statistics from five districts show that 122 dou of various tree seeds were collected in the autumn, and 156 mu of nurseries were established, with 143 mu already sown. This has laid a solid foundation for future construction in the liberated areas and increased income for the masses. (Taihang Third Special District Correspondent Group)
