    Jinan Distributes 100 Million Winter Loans
    Guaranteed Entirely to Poor and Hired Peasants
    [Report from our newspaper in Jinan, 15th] In order to support poor peasants in engaging in various sideline productions during the winter, to solve the livelihood of poor peasants (especially those in disaster-stricken areas), and to meet the needs of spring plowing next year, the Border Region Government has issued 100 million yuan in loans to our region; it is estimated that 16 million yuan will be allocated to the First Administrative Office, 14 million yuan to the Second Administrative District, 25 million yuan to the Third Administrative District, 20 million yuan to the Fourth Administrative District, and 25 million yuan to the Fifth Administrative District. In addition, 69 million yuan in spring loans recovered from various places will be re-lent. At the same time, the bank, in view of the fact that some of the previous loans were not lent to poor peasants, and that the seasonal lending and collection could not fully meet the production needs of poor peasants, convened a branch manager meeting to make the lending work better in the future and determined four key principles for future lending work: First, it is necessary to implement the class line and lend the money entirely to poor peasants. Second, the money should be handed over to the poor peasants themselves for management, democratic management, and rational use. Third, villages that have been affected by disasters for many years, are sparsely populated and poor, and need long-term support should implement the method of "funds not leaving the village" to make the funds circulate flexibly, adapt to sideline industries, and implement the production requirements throughout the year. Fourth, cadres should conduct in-depth inspections, help plan production, and correct deviations. On the basis of poor peasants managing and using loans in rotation, their own credit activities should gradually be established. Cadres should recognize the possibility of this prospect and grasp it well in long-term work, but should not subjectively demand it. Because the above points of view were clarified, the comrades who attended the meeting all believed that this would definitely promote the lending work.

    冀南发放冬贷十万万
    确定完全贷给贫雇
    【本报冀南十五日电】为扶助贫农在冬季从事各种副业生产，解决贫农（特别是受灾区贫农）的生活以及明年春耕的需要，边府发给我区贷款十万万元；计分配一专署一万六千万元，二专区一万四千万元，三专区二万五千万元，四专区二万万元，五专区二万五千万元。此外，尚有各地收回之春季贷款六万九千万元再度贷出。同时，银行鉴于过去贷款仍有部分没贷到贫农手里，而且季节性的贷收也不能完全适应贫农生产需要。为了使今后贷款工作作的更好，特召开分行经理会议，确定今后在贷款工作上的四要原则：一要贯彻阶级路线，把款完全贷给贫农。二要把款交给贫农自己掌握，民主管理，合理使用。三要把连年受灾地薄人穷需长期扶助的村庄，实行款不离村方式，使资金灵活周转，并适应副业，贯彻全年的生产要求。四要干部深入检查，帮助计划生产，纠正偏向。在贫农自己当家轮流使用贷款的基础上，逐渐建立贫农自己的信用活动，干部应认识这个前途的可能性，在长期工作中很好掌握，但不能主观要求。因为明确了以上观点，到会各同志都认为这样作一定能把贷款工作推进一部。
