    D渡kou Inspection Credit Cooperative
    Regulations Have Problems
    Loan Restrictions for Hired and Poor Peasants
    [Report from this newspaper, Shahe] The D渡kou Village Inspection Credit Cooperative discovered the following problems in the village's credit cooperative: (1) From the perspective of loan recipients: loans to newly-liberated hired and poor peasants only accounted for slightly more than 51% of all loans, meaning that half of the loans did not play a role in supporting hired and poor peasants. (2) From the perspective of loan conditions, the past regulations were: 1. Loans should be given to those who can make money. Generally, those with livestock and tools can make money, while hired and poor peasants do not have livestock and tools. 2. Emphasis was placed on combining with private capital. Hired and poor peasants have very little or no private capital. 3. Short-term repayment was stipulated (generally to be repaid within one to two months). Poor peasants need to carry loads for transportation, earning little money and finding it difficult to repay in the short term, thus restricting loans. 4. There was a period when emphasis was placed on loans for buying livestock, but some poor peasants were not yet able to buy livestock and wanted to buy other farm implements or tools, which was not allowed. (3) The relationship between large and small cooperatives was not handled well enough: the credit cooperative is part of the large cooperative, but they did not absorb funds through small cooperatives. When the masses had money, they were willing to invest in small cooperatives but unwilling to deposit in the credit cooperative, so the credit cooperative's funds could not be developed quickly. (4) Hired and poor peasants have the most production difficulties. The credit cooperative did not help and organize them to earn money from production to repay loans, so some people thought it would be difficult to repay loans when applying for them, and were unwilling to borrow. After inspection, it was found that various aspects more or less restricted loans to hired and poor peasants. After the inspection, the cadres clearly realized that they had taken the wrong path in the past. Comrades from the county branch first made a self-criticism at the hired and poor peasants' meeting, and the village credit department cadres also made self-criticisms. They are now determined to serve the hired and poor peasants and help them solve various production difficulties. (Jia Yi, Kui Lin)

    渡口检查信用社
    办法规定有毛病
    雇贫贷款受限制
    【本报沙河讯】渡口村检查信用合作社，发现该村信用社还存在着以下问题：（一）从贷款对象上看：新翻身的雇贫贷款只占全部贷款百分之五十一强，有一半的贷款没有起到扶助雇贫的作用。（二）从贷款条件上看，过去规定的办法是：一、贷给能赚钱的人。一般是有牲口工具的人能赚钱，雇贫没有牲口和工具。二、强调结合私资。雇贫的私资很少或没有。三、规定短期归还（一般是一个月到两个月就要归还）。贫农运输需担挑，赚的钱少短期难以归还，贷款就受了限制。四、有一时期曾强调贷款买牲口，但有些贫农暂时还没有力量购买牲口，愿意买其他农具或工具，就不能贷款。（三）大小合作社的关系搞的还不够好：信用社是大合作社的一部，他们没有通过小型社去吸收资金，群众有了款愿意向小型社入股，而不愿往信用社存款，所以信用资金不能很快发展。（四）雇贫的生产困难最多，信用社没有帮助和组织他们从生产上赚钱还款，所以有些人在贷款时先想到还款不容易，就不愿意贷了。从各方面检查，都或多或少的限制了雇贫贷款。经过检查，干部明确认识了过去是走错了路线，县支行同志首先在雇贫大会上作了自我检讨，村信用部干部也作了检讨，今后要下决心为雇贫服务，帮助雇贫解决各种生产困难问题。      （家义、奎林）
