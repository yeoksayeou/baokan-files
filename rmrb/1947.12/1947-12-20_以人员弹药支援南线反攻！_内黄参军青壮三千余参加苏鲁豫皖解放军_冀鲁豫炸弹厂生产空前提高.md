    [Report from Jilu Yu on the 17th] More than 3,000 young men from Neihuang County have joined the army and been organized into five battalions and twenty companies, officially enlisting to participate in the Su Yu-Wan Field Army. All new recruits held a rally on the 11th of this month to pledge to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. Every new soldier was dressed in a brand-new yellow army uniform, entering the venue with great spirit. After the meeting was opened with the sound of cannons, the new soldiers raised their fists and solemnly swore: "We will not go home until we have fought to Nanjing and captured Chiang Kai-shek alive!" Everyone expressed their determination to be a model soldier and win glory for the people of Neihuang. After the meeting, a parade was held to show their determination. At the front of the procession were four large characters "Pledge to Defeat Chiang Kai-shek." The masses along the streets welcomed them with the sound of cannons and shouted slogans such as "Victory in the counteroffensive!" and "It is an honor to join the army!"

    [Report from Jilu Yu on the 17th] Inspired by the victorious situation of the counteroffensive, the employees of the Jilu Yu Military Region Supply Department's bomb factory are highly motivated in their production, with both the quantity and quality of production reaching unprecedented levels. The staff of the Second Bomb Factory's Sixth Branch has increased daily production from about 1,700 to about 3,500, doubling the output. In terms of quality, the fragments are smaller than before, and the explosive power is enhanced. Previously, if bombs were placed in water for several hours, they would not explode. Now, they can still explode after being placed in water for 48 hours. The great improvement in product quality and quantity has made everyone even more excited. Now, a new wave of production is starting, with a 60-day plan: 1. Abolish Sundays, add two hours of night work every day, and specifically discuss what work is suitable for daytime and what for night work. The roll call system in the branch has also been changed to be held at dinner time. If there is anything to discuss, it can be talked about at the dining hall without taking up a single minute of work time; 2. If the supply of materials is not timely, do whatever work is possible with the available materials. For example, if the carpentry class doesn't have wood, they will renovate carpentry tools and help with sand turning, ensuring that no one wastes a minute; 3. Non-production personnel participate in production. In the branch's meeting of non-production personnel, after planning to participate in production, the cadre group alone filled 1,300 handles in one day, the kitchen group cut more than 800 handle sticks, and the sanitation group dug 250 shells. This further boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers. Hou Fuxiang, the leader of the loading class, urged everyone to get up and turn sand as soon as the pot boiled in the morning before dawn. Bai Yixiang, the leader of the class, insisted on working even after his foot was burned by molten iron, making 350 to 360 molds. Deputy leader Li Xuejin continued to work after his hand was pierced and bandaged. In one firing of 30,300 molds by the whole class, more than 8,500 good shells were produced, setting an unprecedented record in the history of the branch. All comrades in the carpentry class arrived earliest and started work before the whistle was blown. The Fourth Bomb Factory is also stepping up production, continuously firing the furnace twice in ten days, without rest even at dawn and without eating supper. Each carpenter made 300 handles per day, and bought their own kerosene for the night shift. The Fifth Bomb Factory started a competition with each other, starting work earlier and finishing later, with high production enthusiasm.

    冀鲁豫炸弹厂生产空前提高
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】内黄全县参军青壮年三千余名，共编五个营廿个连，已正式入伍，参加苏鲁豫皖野战军。全体新战士，于本月十一举行誓师讨蒋大会，新战士个个穿上崭新的黄军衣，雄赳赳的走进会场。鸣炮开会后，新战士即高举起拳头肃立宣誓：“不打到南京去不活捉蒋介石不回家！”人人表示要当模范，要为内黄人民争光荣。会后举行誓师游行，队伍前列高举着“誓师讨蒋”四个大字，所经过之街道，群众鸣炮欢迎，“反攻胜利！”“参军光荣！”等口号不绝于耳。
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】冀鲁豫军区供给部炸弹厂员工，在反攻胜利形势鼓舞下，生产情绪高涨，生产数量质量均空前提高。炸弹二厂六所员工，每天由出产一千七百左右增到三千五百左右，增产达一倍，在质量上，破片较以前小，爆炸力增强，以前把炸弹放在水中数小时后，就打不响，现在放在水里四十八小时后，仍可以打响。生产品质和数量大大提高后，更使大家兴奋，现又开始突击生产热潮，订出六十天计划：一、废除星期日，每天加夜工两小时，并具体讨论白天适合做啥活，夜工做啥。所部点名制度也改定在吃晚饭时，有事在饭场里谈谈，不侵占一分一秒的工作时间；二、如果材料供应不及时，就有啥材料做啥活。如木工班没木料就改造木工工具、帮助翻沙等，不让一个人空过一分钟；三、干杂人员参加生产，在所部的干杂人员会议上，计划参加生产后，只一天干部组就灌把子一千三百个，伙房组截把子棍八百多个，卫生组挖壳子二百五十个。这更鼓舞了工人同志的生产情绪，装药班长侯福祥，每天烧开锅时天还不明，这时就督促大家起来翻沙。班长白义祥脚被铁汁烧伤还坚持工作，打模子三百五、六十个。副班长李学金手被刺破，包扎以后仍继续工作。全班一次开炉三万零三百个模中，能成好壳子八千五百多，创本所历史上未有的纪录。木工班全体同志起的最早，不等吹哨就上工。炸弹四所亦加紧生产，十天中连着开炉两次，天明仍不休息，不吃夜饭。木工每人每天制把三百，晚上打夜班自己买灯油。炸弹厂五所互相掀起比赛，早上工、晚下工，生产情绪很高。
