　　Our Army in the Southern Front Launches Large-Scale Strategic Destructive Attacks
　　Three New Liberated Areas Linked Together
　　Liberated Twenty-Three County Towns, Eliminating Over 20,000 Bandits
Comprehensive War Report for the Week of December 18th to 24th:
　　New Southern Front Areas:
　　The People's Liberation Army in the Southern Front launched a large-scale strategic destructive war against the two internal war arteries of the Chiang bandit's Pinghan and Longhai lines on the night of the 13th. By noon on the 19th, it had successively achieved major victories. A total of 840 li of railway bridges and tunnels from Liuhe in the east to Zhengzhou in the west along the Longhai Railway, and from Zhengzhou to Xinyang along the Pinghan Railway, have been thoroughly destroyed. Twenty-three cities have been captured successively; in addition several important supply points and stations of the Chiang bandits were seized, eliminating more than 20,000 enemies (excluding the results of the complete annihilation of the 5th Brigade of the Provisional 24th Division of the Chiang bandits and the battle achievements of the Liu-Deng Army). This victory has linked the three major liberated areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan, Yu-Shaan-E, and E-Yu-Wan in the Southern Front into one piece. Our three major field armies have shaken hands and celebrated victory on the Pinghan Line, while the Chiang bandit's position is even more fragmented. The situation in the Central Plains has thus changed greatly.
　　Since launching the offensive in Su-Lu-Yu-Wan, our army has successively captured eleven county towns including Xuchang, Lanfeng, Minquan, Xinzhongmou, Chenliu, Weishi, Yuchuan, Changge, Yanling, Fugou, and Xinzheng, destroyed the Zheng (zhou)-Xu (chang) section of the Pinghan Railway and the Zheng (zhou)-Liu (he) section of the Longhai Railway, totaling 450 li, and eliminated a large part of a cavalry brigade, the entire 40th Division, the entire 41st Division, the entire 68th Division, the 17th Traffic Police Corps, parts of the 26th Independent Brigade of the Ministry of National Defense, and security forces, totaling more than 11,200 people, including more than 10,200 officers and soldiers captured alive, including Ling Peichao, the Major General and Deputy Commander of the Security Forces of the enemy's Fifth Special District. Before and after this, another unit of the Liberation Army, in the area from Boxian and Jieshou to Suiqi, blocked the Chiang bandit's direct line troops, the entire 5th Division and the entire 75th Division, who attempted to reinforce Bian and Zheng. In ten days from the 6th to the 16th, they eliminated more than 4,000 of them, smashing their reinforcement plan. The Liberation Army then captured Liuheji and Liuhe Station in one fell swoop on the 22nd, completely annihilating the 5th Brigade of the Chiang bandit's Provisional 24th Division, capturing alive the brigade commander Chen Fumin. Detailed battle results are being checked. The Yu-Wan-Su local armed forces also took the initiative to attack, and successively recovered the two cities of Shangcai and Xixian on the 16th and 17th, eliminating part of the enemy.
　　At the same time, our army in Yu-Shaan-E fiercely destroyed the Pinghan Road, successively capturing the Chiang bandit's important supply points of Zhumadian and Luohe on the Pinghan Line, as well as the nine county towns of Queshan, Xiping, Suiping, Linying, Tongbai, Biyang, Wuyang, Yexian, and Xiangcheng, thoroughly destroying 390 li of the Xu (chang)-Xin (yang) section of the Pinghan Road, and eliminating more than 4,500 enemies.
　　Our army in E-Yu-Wan operated vertically and horizontally in the area south of Xinyang on the Pinghan Line. On the 17th, Zaoyang in northern Hubei was liberated, and on the same day, they, together with the Yu-Shaan-E Liberation Army, moved into Tongbai. In addition, our local armed forces actively carried out activities, cooperating with the main force to wipe out the Chiang bandits who had invaded the liberated areas, and achieved successive victories. On the 16th, the entire territory of Yuexi was recovered, and the three cities of Taihu, Susong, and Yingshan were successively recovered.
　　Shandong Battlefield:
　　In the Jiaodong area, the enemy is still trapped along the Beihai coast, facing the fate of being annihilated. The Chiang bandits in Qingdao, Yantai and other places are panicked and are forcibly conscripting citizens to build trenches, and are stepping up martial law in the urban area. In early this month, our army in southern Shandong smashed the Chiang bandit's defensive "mopping-up" of over 5,000 people in our Zou, Teng, Si, and Ping mountainous areas, and successively eliminated more than 400 enemies, and captured Bianqiao and other places in Sishui. The local corps of our army in central Shandong is actively carrying out activities. According to the announcement, a total of 212 battles were fought last month, eliminating 2,697 enemies. In the Binhai area, the 188th Regiment of the 83rd Division and a battalion of the 19th Brigade of the Chiang bandits launched an attack on our Liangcheng and Baishishan areas in three routes from Shijiusuo, Rizhao on the 10th. Our local armed forces took the initiative to launch a counterattack, completely defeating the enemy in eight hours, killing, wounding and capturing 360 of them.
　　Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Area:
　　Since the night of the 9th, the Yun (he) Dong local corps of our Ji-Lu-Yu launched an offensive against the Chiang bandits. After two days of battle, they captured the important strongholds of Jinkou, Yuankou, Kaihe, Zhangdakou and other strongholds along the Grand Canal, and successively eliminated more than 400 enemies, completely smashing the Chiang bandit's "Grand Canal defense line." Another unit of our army launched an offensive against the bandits and puppet troops in Dongping, and once captured the city on the afternoon of the 13th. A certain unit of the Liberation Army in northern Henan captured Qimen, a key town on the Weihe River southwest of Junxian, on the 16th, eliminating more than 400 bandits and puppet troops. The local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Taihang actively launched attacks to protect the fields and grain. On the 13th, they ambushed the enemy in Wenxian, killing more than 40 people.
　　Jin-Cha-Ji Area:
　　At the beginning of last month, our local armed militias launched a wide-ranging offensive in coordination with the Battle of Shijiazhuang. In one month, they killed, wounded and captured more than 13,000 enemies, and liberated more than 40 towns and important strongholds of the Chiang bandits, which greatly shocked the Chiang bandits entrenched in the Pingjin-Bao triangle area. The 22nd Division of the 16th Army and the 95th Division of the 62nd Army of the Chiang bandits carried out a retaliatory "mopping-up" of the area from Baxian, Langfang and other places on the 24th of last month. Our local soldiers and civilians insisted on fighting in the same place. Our army in western Tianjin successively captured Wangkou Town on the Grand Canal and Sanlitan, more than ten li southeast of Shengfang, giving a heavy flank attack to the "mopping-up" Chiang bandits. The "mopping-up" went bankrupt and retreated to its original location. At present, except for Baxian, Xiongxian, Guan, Anci and other cities in the Pingjin-Bao triangle area, which are still occupied by bandits, Yongqing, Xinzhen, Rongcheng, Xincheng and other cities and the vast rural areas are under the heroic persistence of our soldiers and civilians.
　　Northwest Battlefield:
　　According to the announcement of the Northwest Joint Defense Command, the local corps guerrillas in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region fought a total of 110 battles last month, eliminating 1,600 enemies.
　　Northeast Battlefield:
　　Our local corps in eastern Hebei continued to launch a destructive war on the Beining Road, and successively captured the Chiang bandit strongholds of ＠cheng, 20 kilometers northwest of Leting, and Tingliuhe, Shigezhuang, Yutian County, and Daniulan on the Luan (xian)-Le (ting) highway from the 12th to the 18th. According to the No. 16 combat communique of the Headquarters of the Democratic Allied Army, one month after the end of the autumn offensive (November 11 to December 11), we continuously attacked the Chiang bandits who were looting grain on the outskirts of Siping and Faku, and successively eliminated 4,469 of their regular army and local troops, and recovered the three cities of Kangping, Lishu, and Changtu.
