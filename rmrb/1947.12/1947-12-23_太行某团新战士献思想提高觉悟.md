Taihang A certain regiment's new soldiers dedicate thoughts to improve awareness.
    [Our News] After the new soldiers of the Taihang Supplementary × Regiment were concentrated, political study began on the 8th of this month, starting with "dedicating thoughts" and "resolving knots." The Third Battalion proposed at a general mobilization meeting: "Dedicate everything to the people," "Leave no knots in our minds." A fervent movement to dedicate thoughts unfolded throughout the battalion. The vast majority of those who joined the army this time were liberated peasants. In some villages, due to poor mobilization methods of village cadres who used "forced voluntarism," there were many complaints against the village cadres. After the soldiers of the Third Battalion expressed their opinions about the village cadres, some demanded to return home to settle accounts and reason with the village cadres, making it impossible to continue studying. After education and discussion, and after reading articles such as "The Deep Blood Feuds of the People of Jiaodong," everyone's hatred was aroused. Some said: "We only thought about going home to settle accounts with the village cadres. Look! Chiang Kai-shek has ravaged our poor brothers into what state." Some said: "Make a suggestion to the higher authorities to quickly cross the Yellow River and fight Old Chiang, to save our poor brothers from the pit of fire." Under the influence of this movement, some who were preparing to desert even turned in their travel permits and food ration coupons. Comrade Sun Shutai, a soldier of the Eighth Squad of the Guard Company, said: "When I came, I brought a return travel permit, preparing to desert. Now I understand, I won't go home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated." Comrade Liu Sanchun of the Eleventh Company of the Third Battalion, because his thinking was not clear, slept under his blanket. When his father came to see him, the company treated him very well. As soon as he saw his child sleeping, he scolded: "You are lying down sleeping instead of studying. If you want to run back, I will smash you to death with a stone." Sanchun said, "I just miss home, I feel relieved after you say that." Another soldier, after receiving a letter from his wife, happily said: "I don't miss home anymore." After the "dedicating thoughts" and "resolving knots" movement, everyone settled down. They got up before dawn every day to climb mountains, run, and throw grenades. A grievance-airing movement is now underway, with everyone vying to pour out their grievances, determined to dig up the roots of suffering. (Jiang Qing)

　　太行某团新战士献思想提高觉悟
    【本报讯】太行补充×团新战士集中后，本月八日，首先从“献思想”“解疙瘩”开始，进行政治学习。三营在全营动员大会上提出：“为人民供献一切”，“思想上不留疙瘩”，全营展开了热烈的献思想运动。这次参军绝大部分是翻身农民，有些村由于村干部“强迫自愿”动员方式不好，对村干部意见很多。三营战士谈出对村干部意见后，有的要求回家给村干部算帐、讲理，学习不下去。经过教育讨论，又读了“胶东人民血海深仇”等文章后，激起了大家的仇恨，有的说：“咱光想回家给村干部算帐哩，你看！蒋介石把咱穷弟兄糟踏成啥了。”有的说：“给上级提个意见，赶快过黄河打老蒋，救咱的穷弟兄出火坑”。在这样运动影响下，有个别准备开小差的，带的路条、粮票，都交出来了；警卫连八班战士孙书太同志说：“来时我就带个回路条，准备开小差，现在想通了，打不倒蒋介石我不回家”。三营十一连刘三春同志，因为思想不通，蒙着被子睡觉，父亲来看他，连部招待得很好，他一见孩子在睡觉就骂：“你不学习躺着睡觉，你要往回跑，我非用石头砸死你不行”。三春说“我就是结记家，你这一说我就放心了”。另一个战士接到老婆信后，很高兴的说：“不结记家了”。经过“献思想”“解疙瘩”运动之后，大家都安心了，每天天不明就起来爬山跑步扔手榴弹，现正展开诉苦运动，大家争前恐后的倒苦水，决心刨老根。　（江清）
