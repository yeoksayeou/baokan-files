    Mutual aid transportation can solve difficulties, and Xiaocongyu Village in Qinshui County is an example. In the winter of 1944, the village was subjected to enemy burning and killing. Of more than 400 houses, only a few dozen remained. Each person had only eight dou of grain left. At this time, the masses were preparing to sell the village's thirteen donkeys to survive the famine. To overcome this difficulty, the village cadres, including Ren Huadong, first organized everyone to build a coal kiln. Together with an existing one, they arranged for 29 people to work in the kiln. They then organized 32 people and 13 donkeys to open a charcoal yard at Laojuntou to sell charcoal, earning two shi of corn each day, totaling 170 shi of corn in two and a half months. In the spring of the following year, they earned another 210 shi of corn. Thus, the entire village safely weathered the disaster caused by the Japanese invaders and also developed a transportation business. Besides solving the food shortage and temporary expenses from transportation production, the number of livestock increased from the original thirteen donkeys to forty-three, including eighteen mules, with an average capital of 50,000 yuan per animal. In the past, they valued transportation over agriculture. Last spring, they reorganized the transportation workers into groups, with one person driving two or three animals specifically for transportation. The remaining sixteen people specialized in farming at home. From the profits earned from transportation, they bought thirteen oxen. Those who farmed at home cultivated the land for the transportation workers, only returning half a work unit because the transportation workers were also losing work time. The transportation workers, after deducting expenses, would contribute 1,500 yuan out of every 10,000 yuan earned as profit. If people without livestock used livestock from others, they would pay wages for the labor and difference in rice for the difference in service, so they could also enjoy the benefits of transportation. If the yield of the land farmed for the transportation workers exceeded the usual output, 20% would be awarded to the farmers. To expand the scope of mutual aid and combine participation in war and production, human and animal power were all scored. Animal power was calculated based on the weight carried and the distance traveled. Within 20 li, the top labor point was 3 points; 30 li, 5 points; 30 to 60 li, 10 points. The weight carried, ranging from 160 jin at the highest to 60 jin at the lowest, was scored accordingly, with an additional point for every 10 jin carried. Militia and civilian laborers who participated in the war earned 15 points for participating in combat, 13 points for going to the front without participating in combat, and 10 points for providing service. Those who deserted and returned would be penalized by deducting 2 labor points per day and would also be punished. Furthermore, good livestock were grouped together to travel long distances, while less capable livestock traveled shorter distances. Because those with and without livestock could exchange labor, and people were willing to engage in transportation as their fields were cultivated even when they were away. Some people who traveled to Henan and Shanxi spent several months on the road, but their families were not neglected. In the past few years of mutual aid transportation, the village has become wealthy, newly building 170 houses. This year, due to the addition of livestock, 200 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, and each mu of crops yields one to three dou of grain more than in previous years. The whole village has 56 head of cattle, donkeys, and mules.

    互助运输发财致富
    窦凯
    互助运输，就是能解决困难，沁源小聪峪就是个例子。该村在卅三年冬，被敌人烧杀后，四百多间房子只剩下几十间，每人只剩有八斗粮食，这时，群众就准备把村中的十三头毛驴卖了渡荒，该村干部任化东等，为战胜这种困难，就先组织大家打了一座煤窑，连同旧有的一座，安置了二十九人下窑后，又组织了三十二人和十三头毛驴，在老君头开了一座炭场卖炭，每天能往回赚二石玉茭，前后两个半月时间，共赚了一百七十石玉茭。第二年春，又赚了二百一十石玉茭。至此，全村安然渡过日寇造成的灾荒，同时也发展了运输事业。从运输生产中，解决了食粮不足和临时用项外，由当时的十三头毛驴，发展到四十三个牲口，其中已有十八条骡子，每个牲口平均有五万元的资本。他们在以往的观念中，是重视运输忽视农业的，去年春天，才把跑运输的人重新组织成小组，一人赶两个或三个牲口，专门搞运输，其余的十六人，专门在家种地，从运输赚的红利中，买了十三头牛，在家种地的人，把运输人的地种上，只还半个工，因为在外面运输的人，也是误工。跑运输的人除化销外，每赚一万元抽一千五百元作为红利。如没牲口的人，给有牲口的人动弹了，支出工得工资，支出差得差米，这样也能享到运输利；在家给运输人种的地，如果超出一般的产量，抽出百分之二十奖励种地的人。为了扩大互助范围，及参战与生产结合，人畜力都评了分，畜力以驮的重量与走的远近计算，在廿里以内的顶差票三分，卅里顶五分，卅里至六十里的顶十分，驮的重量高的一百六十斤，低的六十斤，以重量多少评了分，多驮十斤顶一分。民兵民工参战，参加战斗顶十五分，不参加战斗到前方的顶十三分，支差顶十分，如开了小差回来，每天除扣除二分工差外，还要处分。更把好牲口组成一组跑远路，不好牲口跑近路。因为有牲口和没牲口能变工，运输的人走了也有人给种地，出门很放心，愿意运输。如有些人跑河南，跑晋绥，一走几个月，家里的事甚也误不了。该村在几年来的互助运输中，是发财致富了，新修起房子一百七十间，今年因添进牲口，还消灭了二百亩荒地，每亩庄稼比往年多打一斗至三斗粮食，全村有牛驴骡五十六头。
