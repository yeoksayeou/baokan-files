　　Astonishing Banquet Expenses!
　　The Organizer Should be Held Responsible for Inspection
　　Comrade Editor:
　　The Taihang First Military Sub-district spent a total of 700,000 yuan on banquets for cadres of the southward-bound troops. This banquet involved buying seaweed from Xingtai and hiring chefs. The funds were distributed among various departments of the sub-district (?). This year, the First Military Sub-district suffered from locusts, wind, rain, hail, and frost, resulting in a serious disaster situation. Approximately 500,000 people are short of food, and if no measures are taken, many will have nothing to eat by next spring. For example, the people of Mayu Village in Jingxing Fifth District currently have an average of less than two "he" (a unit of measurement) of rice per person per day, and they often lack oil and salt. 700,000 yuan could save so many landless poor people who have no food! Have they forgotten the famine? Who was in charge of organizing this event? A good self-reflection should be made! I think it is acceptable to treat southward-bound cadres to a meal, but it should not be so extravagant and wasteful.

### 惊人的请客费！　主持者应负责作检查

　　惊人的请客费！
  　主持者应负责作检查编者同志：
    太行一分区送南下部队干部请客共花费七十万元。这次请客，是从邢台买的海菜，请的厨师，款是分区各机关摊的（？）。今年一分区连遭蝗、风、雨、雹、霜灾害袭击，灾情严重，约近五十万人口缺吃的，如不设法，到明春就有许多人没吃的。如井陉五区马峪村的群众，现在每人每日平均不到二合米，油盐经常吃不到。七十万可以救济多少没饭吃的雇贫群众呵！把灾荒忘了吗？不知谁主持办这样事情？应很好的作反省！我觉得对南下干部请吃一顿是可以的，但不应这样铺张浪费。
