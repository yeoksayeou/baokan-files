　　Snippets from the KMT-Controlled Areas
　　Recently, the puppet Chiang Kai-shek's Ganlu Township Office in the Eighth District of Huai'an, Jiangsu, dispatched "Self-Defense Force" members to the Yunhe Ferry in Yangmiao Town. Under the pretext of investigating "communist bandits," they arbitrarily arrested passersby to fill the army ranks. Chen Zhitian, an elderly resident of the Yingxun Town First Bao in the county's suburbs, was also detained. Because Chen had a beard, he was forcibly taken to a barber shop to have it shaved off and then drafted as a soldier for inspection in the city. The villagers were filled with hatred.
　　Lin Zipei, the head of the puppet Chiang Kai-shek's Forestry Bureau in Minhou County, Fujian, was found guilty of corruption. The puppet court, under public pressure, sentenced Lin to four years in prison in early October. However, he was released the next day. Lin and his "wife" rode around town in a fancy car, causing a public outcry.
　　A Shanghai newspaper recently published a satirical poem about the collusion and protection of smugglers by puppet Chiang Kai-shek's officials. The poem reads: "Silver wings descend from the sky, sails emerge from the waves. Who recognizes smuggling? They try to deceive the customs. Foreign goods, foreign goods, penetrate deep into remote rural villages."
　　Another verse: "Generals descend from the heavens, merchants travel up the river. It is clearly smuggling, yet they act with great pomp and circumstance. Alas, alas, why endure eight years of bitter resistance?"

　　蒋管区零讯
    蒋匪江苏淮安第八区甘露乡乡公所近派遣“自卫队”员在杨庙镇运河渡口，以盘查“奸匪”为名，任意拘捕行人补充兵额，该县城郊迎熏镇第一保年老居民陈志田亦遭扣留，当以陈蓄有胡子，即强送至剃头店内剃光后充作壮丁，送城受验，乡民均恨之入骨。
    蒋匪闽林森县田粮处长林子佩贪污，蒋匪地院迫于公愤于十月初将林判刑四年，但翌日即释放出狱，林与其“太太”坐“鸳鸯车”招摇过市，舆论哗然。
    沪某报日前载讽刺蒋匪官员勾结，包庇走私词一首。词云：银翼凌空飞落，帆影横波出没，谁人识走私？且把开津瞒过。洋货、洋货，深入寒村野陌。
    又：将军自天而降，海客溯江而上，分明是走私，却要大模大样。惆怅、惆怅，何必八年苦抗。
