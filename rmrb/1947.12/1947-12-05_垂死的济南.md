　　Dying Jinan
    Forced Issuance of "Identity Certificates"
    Under the rule of the Chiang bandit gang in Jinan City, citizens have recently been forced to obtain "identity certificates." The Jinan Chiang bandit defense headquarters issued a notice to all residents, regardless of age or gender, to go to the municipal government to collect their "National Identity Cards" according to their household registration before October 8th and to carry them at all times. Merchants from outside the city, whether long-term or temporary residents, must first find a guarantor (two or more people) and obtain a "Floating Population Guarantee" from the police station, which they must also carry at all times. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to reside in the city. As a result, residents are extremely indignant, saying, "No matter what tricks old Chiang tries, he is doomed!"
    "Victory Day" Brought "Sorrow"
    On the day of celebrating "Victory Day" (the victory against Japan) this year, the supplement to "North China News" published an article titled "A Sense of Humor," which stated that the celebration of Victory Day the year before last was "jubilant," last year's celebration of Victory Day was "doubtful," this year's celebration of Victory Day was "sad," and next year's celebration of Victory Day "may have to be moved to Tokyo." Furthermore, due to the continuous rise in prices, the lives of ordinary citizens are difficult, and even Chiang bandit officials are saying, "Victory Day is a very harsh satire for me. The year before last, my salary was enough to buy a new suit. Last year, it was enough to buy a used suit. This year, it can only buy a shirt. The more we celebrate Victory Day, the less we can make ends meet!"
    Prices Increase Dramatically
    In order to save their dying rule, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is engaging in both heavy taxation and transferring their bureaucratic capital to "safe havens." Some are moving capital from Jinan to Shenyang, and when Shenyang seems insecure, they move it to Qingdao, and then to Nanjing. As a result, prices in Jinan City have skyrocketed. From September 20th to October 6th, the price of gold rose from 2.4 million yuan to 4.9 million yuan per tael, and the price of foreign cloth rose from 600,000 yuan to 1.1 million yuan per bolt. Other daily necessities have also increased in price, with salt rising to 8,500 yuan per catty and millet to over 3,000 yuan per catty. Coal is particularly scarce, rising to over 3,000 yuan per catty. Citizens are mostly burning horse manure, and businesses are mostly burning bean cakes. It is rumored that "large denomination" bills of 50,000 yuan are about to be issued. Prices are bound to rise again, and citizens are saying, "How are we going to survive in the future?!"

　　垂死的济南
    强发“身份证明书”
    蒋匪统治下的济南市，最近强迫市民领取“身份证明书”，济南蒋匪防守司令部，曾通告全市居民，不分老幼、男女，均须依户口，于十月八日前去市府领取“国民身份证”，并要随身带着。外来的商民无论久住或暂住，均须先找着保人（二人以上），向警察局领取“流动人口保证书”，亦随身携带，否则一律不准留市居住。因此，居民异常愤激说：“老蒋无论想啥法，都要完蛋！”
    “胜利节”带来了“悲哀”
    今年庆祝“胜利节”（抗战胜利）之日，“华北新闻”副刊上发表“幽默之感”一文，略谓前年庆祝胜利节“狂欢”，去年庆祝胜利节“怀疑”，今年庆祝胜利节“悲哀”，明年庆祝胜利节“或者要搬到东京去”。又因物价连年上涨，市民生活不用说，就连一般蒋匪公务人员们都说：“胜利节，对我是个很刻薄的讽刺，前年胜利节我的薪水够买一套新衣服，去年胜利节够买一套旧衣服，今年胜利节仅能买一套衬衣了，越庆祝胜利节越没办法！”
    物价飞跃增涨
    蒋介石匪帮们为挽救其临死前的统治，一方面横征暴敛，一方面将自己的官僚资本向“保险地带”转移。有的从济南将资本移到沈阳，看沈阳不保，又移到青岛，又移到南京。因此，造成济南市物价飞跃上涨，自九月二十日开始到十月六日止，黄金每两原价二百四十万元，涨至四百九十万元，洋布每匹原价六十万元，涨至一百一十万元。其他日用品，盐涨至八千五百元一斤，小米三千余元一斤。煤炭特别缺乏，每斤涨至三千多元。市民们多烧马粪，商号多烧豆饼。近闻五万元的“大票”即将发行。物价必会再涨，市民都说：“以后这可怎么过？！”（新华社冀鲁豫电讯）
