Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 14th: TASS Nanjing, December 12th, quoting the Hong Kong Hua Shang Bao: After more than three weeks of general strike, 30,000 middle school and university students in Kunming have achieved a preliminary victory and will resume classes in mid-December, as the Yunnan Chiang bandit authorities have been forced to release most of the arrested students. According to a report in the Tianjin Dagong Bao on November 16th: The Yunnan Chiang bandits had severely suppressed the students' just strike, forcing the dissolution of the student self-government associations of Yunnan University and its affiliated high school, expelling nine Yunnan University students, and issuing demerits to eighteen others, even forcing parents to take their children home. However, due to the united and heroic struggle of the Kunming students, all the Chiang bandits' conspiracies were defeated, achieving a preliminary victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 13th: Tianjin Newspaper reports: All faculty and staff of Shanxi University in Taiyuan held an anti-hunger strike starting on the 1st. Prices in Taiyuan are the highest in the country, even higher than in Pingjin by more than double, and the highest salary grade of faculty and staff cannot buy three bags of flour, making it impossible for a family of three to maintain their livelihood. The faculty and staff stated that they would not resume teaching until they achieved the same treatment as universities in Pingjin.

Also: Tianjin Beiyang University students announced a strike on the 30th of last month due to the school's financial difficulties and the issue of the president, and are preparing to petition in Nanjing as a whole. The school has had difficulty finding anyone willing to serve as its president due to financial difficulties.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 14th: According to Pingjin newspapers, students in Ping and Tianjin commemorated the second anniversary of "December 1st" as follows: In Beiping, the North China Student Federation held a meeting in front of the North Building of Peking University on November 30th, with several thousand students from various schools attending in the cold wind. The chairman pointed out in his opening remarks: The significance of commemorating the four martyrs of Kunming lies not in passively mourning, but in inspiring the living to continue to strive for the realization of Chinese democracy. The North China Student Federation representative reported on the recent situation of the two arrested students of Peking University, Meng Xian Gong and Li Gong Yi, in prison, followed by a report that the International Student Federation held in Prague, Czech Republic, in August had attached great importance to the report of the Chinese Student Federation representative and would send representatives to China for inspection in January next year. After the report, the "December 1st" chorus was sung, with lyrics accusing the Chiang bandits of persisting in the civil war and dictatorial policies during and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, and of massacring Kunming students, etc. ... The lyrics finally revealed that the Chiang bandits had reached the end of their road. After the meeting, an exhibition of historical materials on the student movement was held, with abundant materials, including the December 1st massacre, the Jiaochangkou massacre, the Li Wen blood case, the Wuhan University massacre, the Yu Zisan case, and other historical materials, showing the bloody atrocities committed by the Chiang bandits in massacring students and professors over the past two years to the eyes of the visitors. In Tianjin, the Nankai University Student Self-Government Association held a commemorative evening party on the 1st, with many students from various schools attending. In addition to professors' speeches, the historical drama "Believers of Democracy" and the "Yellow River Cantata" were performed. On the same day, an exhibition of historical materials on "December 1st" was held. On the evening of November 30th, the school's New Poetry Society held a poetry evening, with collective recitations of Ai Qing's "Torch" and other programs. The atmosphere at the venue was solemn.
