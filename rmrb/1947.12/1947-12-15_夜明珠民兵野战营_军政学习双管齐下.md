    The Ye Mingzhu Militia Field Camp
    Military and Political Learning Go Hand in Hand
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch] The Yangcheng First District militia "Ye Mingzhu" (Night-Luminous Pearl) field camp launched its winter training movement on November 22nd, using the method of "combining learning with application, mutual teaching and mutual learning" to improve military skills and purify class weapons through class investigation and organizational checks. They first learned how to use terrain and ground objects, and various methods of advancing under enemy fire, by combining learning with application. One group would practice, and everyone would observe. After the exercise, everyone would evaluate the advantages and disadvantages, and propose how to promote the advantages and overcome the disadvantages, and then practice again, and evaluate again. Through repeated exercises and repeated evaluations, they understood the spirit of the combat regulations from practical actions, which was very effective. In nine days, everyone learned the above actions. They also launched a military learning assistance movement by using the method of "soldiers teaching soldiers" and mutual teaching and mutual learning. According to each militiaman's military expertise, various military learning groups were organized, such as the model class of Pan Shunhe in the Fifth Company, which extracted five militiamen with various expertise and organized five groups: a machine gun group, a shooting group, a grenade throwing group, a field action group, and a drill ground action group, to carry out mutual teaching and mutual learning. In nine days, they learned seven-tenths of the above actions.
    In terms of political study, the class consciousness of the militia was first raised through methods of investigating class, investigating feudalism, investigating emancipation, and investigating organization, with the understanding that the militia is the class armed force of the peasants themselves, and that guns must be in the hands of their own class brothers, and that bad elements must not be allowed to take advantage of loopholes. Thus, the diehard pseudo-personnel, landlord saboteurs in the militia were purged, including the former hired hand, former petty landlord Li Tian'en, Chen ×shui, Yang Anhui, Zhang Guan, and six others, thereby purifying the militia ranks. This made everyone believe that the militia is their own class armed force and that they should study technology well in order to defend themselves and eliminate the enemy. As Sun Yicheng, a militiaman from Qina Village, said: "After cleaning out the former petty landlord Li Tian'en, I realized our class status. Now I can carry my own gun and I must resolutely fight to the end to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek." At the same time, it also improved everyone's learning enthusiasm. For example, Yan Sanjiang planned to learn five new characters every day, and whenever he had time, day and night, he would write words on the ground or on bricks with his fingers. Their slogan was "Fingers as pens, ground as paper, write words whenever you have time." Now each class has organized a study group, and after class they are busy recognizing characters, writing characters, copying songs, copying allegro... The first, second, and third platoons of the Second Company put forward conditions such as "Study hard and practice hard, teach everything and learn everything, military actions must be swift, learn how to shoot guns and throw grenades," and challenged each other to compete.

    夜明珠民兵野战营
    军政学习双管齐下
    【本报太岳九日电】阳城一区民兵“夜明珠”野战营，于十一月二十二开始冬季练兵运动，以“学用结合、互教互学”的办法，提高了军事技术；经查阶级，查组织，纯洁了阶级武装。他们首先以学用结合的办法，学习利用地形地物，在敌火力下运动的各种跃进方法。一组演习，大家参观，演习完了，大家评定优缺点，并提出如何发扬优点克服缺点，马上再来演习，再来评定。如此反复演习，反复评定，从实际的行动中领会战斗条令的精神，收效很大，九天的功夫，个个都学会了以上的动作。又以“兵教兵”的互教互学办法，展开军事学习互助运动。按每个民兵的军事特长，组织各种军事学习小组，如五连潘顺河模范班，就抽出五个有各种特长的民兵，分别组织了机枪组、射击组、投弹组、野外动作组、操场动作组等五个组，展开互教互学运动，九天中学会了以上动作的十分之七。
    在政治学习方面，首先以查阶级、查封建、查翻身、查组织的方法，提高了民兵的阶级觉悟，认为民兵是农民自己的阶级武装，枪杆要掌在自己阶级兄弟的手里，不能让坏分子钻了空子，于是清洗了民兵中的顽伪人员地主破坏分子，原古手、原小仁李天恩、陈×水、杨安会、张管等六人，纯洁了民兵的阵营。这样就使大家认为民兵是自己的阶级武装，应该很好的学习技术，才能保卫自己消灭敌人，如其纳村民兵孙依成说：“清洗了原小仁、李天恩后，我认识了我们阶级地位，现在能背上自己的枪，非坚决干到底消灭蒋介石不行。”同时也提高了大家的学习情绪，如阎三江，计划每天要学会五个生字，白天黑夜一有空就以指头在地上、在砖上写字，他们提出的口号是“指头做笔，地作纸，一有空子就写字”现各班都组织有学习小组，一下课就忙着认字、写字、抄歌子、抄快板……。二连的一、二、三排，提出“苦学苦练，教甚学会甚，军事动作要迅速，打枪投弹都学会”等条件，互相挑战竞赛。
