Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. Captured soldiers of Ma Hongkui's army, after arriving at the People's Liberation Army, have successively accused Ma Bandit of warlord rule and various evils of extorting soldiers. Soldier Li Shengsheng bitterly recounted how Ma Bandit simultaneously seized his three brothers in June this year and forcibly incorporated them into the Fourth Regiment of the Provisional Ninth Brigade. In this adventurous reinforcement of the Yulin battle, they were severely attacked by the People's Liberation Army. His elder brother had already died in vain, his younger brother was seriously injured, and he himself laid down his weapons and was fortunate to be reborn. Guo Zhanghai's experience was even more tragic. His only son was seized by Ma Bandit the year before last. He is now forty-seven years old, and because his cousin escaped from the Provisional Ninth Brigade, and there were no more men in his relatives, he was seized to replace him, leaving behind his seventy-year-old mother at home with no food or clothing. Since Su Changchun was seized to be a soldier, his wife took his son to beg for food. Ma Xinlong, Li Ming, and others unanimously stated that after they were seized to be soldiers, their families were unable to cultivate the land, and the fields were barren. But Ma Bandit still demanded grain and money. Li Ming's family of several people had only five mu of land, and they had to provide two dan of military grain a year. He himself had to ask for money from his family to sew military uniforms. Dai Canghai said that the officer Wang Fengcheng sewed cotton clothes for them, and one chi of cloth cost 5,000 yuan (Chiang currency) on the market, but he said it was 8,000 yuan. As for deducting food and military pay and extorting soldiers, it was commonplace.

    马鸿逵军被俘士兵
    控诉马匪军阀统治
    【新华社西北八日电】被俘马鸿逵军士兵到解放军后纷纷控诉马匪的军阀统治，与敲榨士兵的种种罪恶。士兵李生成痛诉马匪于今年六月同时将其弟兄三人抓走，强迫编入暂九旅保四团，在此次冒险增援榆林战中，遭解放军痛击，其兄已无谓送死，其弟负重伤，他本人放下武器幸获新生。郭章海的遭遇更悲惨，其独子于前年被马匪抓去，他今年已四十七岁，因其表弟从暂九旅逃跑，亲属中再无男人，他即被抓去顶替，家中还抛着没吃没穿的七十岁老娘。苏长春自被抓去当兵后，他老婆领着儿子去讨吃。马新龙、李明等一致诉说他们被抓当兵后，家中无力耕种，田地荒芜。但马匪仍要粮要款，李明全家数口只有五亩地，一年就要出两石军粮，自己当兵还得从家里要钱缝军衣。戴仓海说，官长王凤成代他们缝棉衣，一尺布市价五千元（蒋币）他却说是八千元。至于克扣伙食军饷敲榨士兵，更是家常便饭。
