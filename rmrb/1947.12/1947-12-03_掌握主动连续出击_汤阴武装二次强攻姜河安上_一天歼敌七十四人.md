　　Mastering Initiative Through Continuous Attacks
    Tangyin Armed Forces Second Strong Assault on Jianghe Anshang
    Annihilating Seventy-Four Enemies in One Day
    [This newspaper, Tangyin news] Our Independent Detachment, Unit 306, Work Team, militia from the Third and Sixth Districts, and a part of supporting militia, launched a second strong assault on the enemy strongholds of Jianghe and Anshang at dawn on the 23rd of last month. After four hours of fierce fighting, they annihilated seventy-four enemies. After the enemy in Jianghe and Anshang were partially annihilated by us on the 10th of last month, they were still unwilling to give up the area, attempting to defend the strongholds to the death, especially by increasing a machine gun and mobilizing village defense teams from Dahuangcun and Gongguangcun every night to reinforce defenses. In order to protect grain and manpower, and to continuously strike the enemy, we organized a second strong assault on these two strongholds at dawn on the 23rd. After four hours of fierce fighting, most of the enemy were annihilated, and the Jianghe and Anshang strongholds were immediately captured by us. After the enemy in Huangcun, Tiancun, and Suzhuang learned of this, they hastily came to reinforce, but were fiercely attacked by our ambushing troops. After completing the task of killing and wounding the enemy, we proactively withdrew from the above two strongholds. In this battle, a total of thirty-seven enemies were captured, twenty-four were killed, thirteen were wounded, and two rifles, three cane guns, over a hundred bullets, and many red-tasseled spears were seized.
    On the same day, our armed forces withdrawn from Chengguan, in coordination with the Jianghe and Anshang battles, proactively attacked Sun Dongzhuang. After luring the enemy out of the stronghold, we immediately launched a counterattack. The enemy abandoned three corpses, two wounded, and fled in panic. (Shen Zhi)
    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu One Day Telegram] After the Hui people in Minquan County were emancipated, more than eighty villages organized joint defense to protect their homes and fields, and to strike at the Chiang bandits. On October 30th, the Chiang bandit gang of Zhang Shengtai, with more than five hundred men, attacked Zhuzhuang and Wuzhuang Zhai in the Third District at night. Comrade Zhu Shitan, the captain, immediately led the Hui people's joint defense team to attack the enemy. At the same time, armed Hui people from all around swarmed in and repeatedly engaged the enemy in four rounds of fighting. The Chiang bandits, with five seriously wounded, fled south. Upon hearing the news, the Minquan Brigade intercepted the enemy midway and captured five Chiang bandits. At dawn on the first day, the Chiang bandit Minquan Security Team, with more than three hundred men, went to the Second District to loot grain. Upon hearing the news, the Hui people's armed forces in the Second District swarmed in and engaged in a fierce battle for three hours. The Chiang bandits were unable to resist and retreated in defeat. The Hui people's armed forces were in high spirits and pursued the enemy for more than ten *li*.
