　　Ji-Lu-Yu Local Armed Forces Cooperate with Field Army to Attack
　　Actively Sabotage the Longhai Railway
　　He-Kao Highway also Thoroughly Destroyed by Our Army
[Reported by our newspaper from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 21st] Our Fifth Military Sub-district's local armed forces actively launched attacks, cooperating with the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Field Army in combat, once again sabotaging the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and occupying Tianzhuang Station, creating a model battle example with no casualties. Our Fifth Military Sub-district's local armed forces launched a sabotage campaign on the night of the 12th of this month. The Kaocheng Brigade of the sub-district surrounded the Wangzhuang stronghold near Xiaosong, which was garrisoned by the puppet Kaocheng Second and Third District. After one hour of battle, the defending enemy was completely annihilated by us, capturing 46 bandits and puppets, seizing one light machine gun, more than 40 rifles and pistols, 12 mules and horses, and some other supplies. The Qi-He Brigade launched a large-scale sabotage operation on the He-Kao Highway on the night of the 13th, and the entire line was completely destroyed by us. The enemy along the line (one battalion of the 181st Brigade and part of the puppet local Second Team) was panicked. The enemy in Zhuangzhai and Caikou once fled. At the same time, a certain local corps and the Minquan Brigade of our army once again sabotaged the Jiangpolou to Tianzhuang section of the Longhai Railway. Four Chinese miles of the railway line were overturned again, all sleepers were burned, the rails were moved away, and Tianzhuang Station was occupied, and the enemy's built fortifications and bunkers were completely destroyed. On the night of the 14th, the Dongming Brigade and the Nanhua Independent Regiment advanced to the west of Wuba and completely annihilated more than 60 enemy town government personnel stationed at the Huzhuang stronghold, killing 4 enemy company commanders and below, capturing 56 platoon leaders and below, seizing 23 rifles and pistols, 330 rounds of ammunition, and liberating more than 20 arrested civilians. In the above continuous battles, we only consumed more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition and suffered no casualties. The military region issued a special circular of commendation, and the sub-district is still expanding its victories.
[Reported by our newspaper from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 23rd] Our Dongming Brigade, in cooperation with the Nanhua Independent Regiment, penetrated the heart of the enemy-occupied area of Dongming on November 17, fighting seven major and minor battles, capturing six strongholds including Daxuji and Mazhuang, killing and capturing more than 50 bad eggs and local tyrants, seizing more than 10 rifles, 3 hand grenades, and more than 600 rounds of ammunition.
[Reported by our newspaper from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 23rd] Since Nanhua unified the leadership of the militia and established the militia revenge brigade, it has been actively operating on the border of the county. Last month, at Macunjie, 30 li north of Heze, it repelled more than 500 local tyrants from Cao County and Juancheng, and killed and wounded two enemies; in cooperation with the Nanhua Independent Regiment, it annihilated the Gaozhuangji puppet Bao Gong Office of the Chiang bandits, killing the enemy district instructor Si Yaonan, the Bao chief, the captain, the head of the market, and five others, capturing three bandits and puppets alive, obtaining four guns and 340 rounds of ammunition. On the 24th, they cooperated with a certain district team in Dongming to attack the enemy, obtaining 20 guns and capturing more than 30 bad eggs that day. On the 26th, they cooperated with the county independent regiment to eliminate the Gao Xiangzhuang Bao Gong Office bandits, capturing 12 enemies and obtaining 11 guns and 1 pistol. The revenge team often appears in the Maozhuang and Linzhuang areas west of Heze. On October 5, they continuously wiped out the enemy in eight villages west of Heze, capturing five bad eggs. Due to the active activities of the revenge brigade, actively fighting the enemy, and the influence of our great counter-offensive victory, the masses in the enemy-occupied areas were greatly encouraged, while the bandits and puppets were extremely panicked.
