    Nanlan Village, Changzhi
    Landlord and Rich Peasant Women as Group Leaders
    Preventing Poor and Hired Peasants from Learning to Weave
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] In Nanlan Village, Second District, weaving has a very good foundation, but weaving in this village is unorganized, with everyone looking after themselves. The main reason for the inability to organize is that the poor and hired peasants are not in power. Nominally, there are thirty-three weaving groups in the village, and the group leaders are appointed. Whoever can speak well and delay work is chosen as the group leader, regardless of their class background. Among the thirty-three group leaders, two are landlords, four are rich peasants, two are well-to-do middle peasants (all having undergone struggle sessions), seventeen are old middle peasants, and eight are newly emancipated peasants. There are also ten weaving team leaders, including two landlords, one rich peasant, one well-to-do middle peasant (all having undergone struggle sessions), three old middle peasants, and three newly emancipated peasants. The chairwoman of the women's association is an old middle peasant and not upright. In one year, thirty-eight women learned to weave, including two landlords, one rich peasant, one bankrupt landlord, six well-to-do middle peasants, eighteen old middle peasants, and only eight newly emancipated peasants. The landlords and rich peasants are in power. Most of those who learned to weave are targets of struggle. There is also a weaving factory, led by a well-to-do middle peasant, who only allows well-to-do middle peasants and targets of struggle to learn weaving, preventing newly emancipated women from learning to weave. After understanding this situation, the leadership convened a meeting of poor and hired peasant activists and cadres on November 29th. At first, everyone thought the weaving was not bad, but the leadership asked, "If you say it's good, how many newly emancipated households can weave?" They asked everyone to discuss it. Sister Shen Fu said, "To tell the truth about weaving, we can't do it at all, and they won't let us learn." Zhang Xianming said, "The two weaving team leaders in the southeast street are both landlords, and the wife of Yuan Qi Wang is a 'loose woman'. They won't lead us to learn weaving, and I won't let my wife go, I'm afraid she'll learn bad things from her." After these speeches, everyone unanimously proposed changing the group leaders. The next day, a mass meeting was held to remove seven landlords and seven rich peasants as group leaders. Through voluntary combination by the masses, twenty-eight weaving groups were organized, and poor and hired peasants were elected as group leaders. (Jù Zhāng)

    长治南兰村
    地富妇女当组长
    不让贫雇学织布
    【本报长治讯】二区南兰村，纺织是很有基础的，但这村纺织是没有组织的，只是各顾各。组织不起来的主要原因，是贫雇没掌权，全村名义上有三十三个纺织组，组长是指定的，谁会说话能误起工就叫谁当组长，也不看成份。卅三个组长，就有地主二户、富农四户、富中农二户（都经过斗争），旧中农十七户，新翻身八户。另有十个纺织队长，有地主二户、富农一户、富中农一户（都经过斗争），旧中农三户、新翻身三户，妇会主席是旧中农，又不正派。一年当中学会织妇三十八名，就有地主二户、富农一户、破产地主一户、富中农六户、旧中农十八户、新翻身仅有八户。地富掌权。学会织布的大部是斗争对象。又有一个纺织工厂，领导人是个富中农，织布是叫富中农斗争对象学，就不让新翻身妇女学织布。领导上了解这种情况后，在十一月二十九日，召开贫雇积极分子和干部会议，开始大家以为纺织还不错，领导上提出：“你们说好，新翻身户多少会织布的？”让大家讨论，申富姐说：“要说织布，咱是都不会，咱想学人家不叫咱学。”张先明说：“东南街两个纺织队长都是地主，原起旺媳妇又是个‘破鞋’，他们就不领导咱学织布，我也不叫我老婆去，恐怕跟上他学坏哩。”经过这些发言，大家一致提出改换组长，第二天就召开群众大会，罢免七个地主七个富农的组长，经群众自愿结合，组织了二十八个纺织组，选出贫雇当组长。  （聚章）
