Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 29th: London—The fifth session of the Council of Foreign Ministers opened on the 25th at Lancaster House in London. Participants included Molotov, Marshall, Bidault, Bevin, and several assistant foreign ministers. After a brief address by Bevin, the meeting began to discuss procedural matters. The U.S., British, and French imperialist bloc put forward "identical draft proposals in every word" (TASS), and insisted on discussing the Austrian treaty issue first; the Soviet Union strongly advocated that the preparation procedure for the German treaty should be the first item on the meeting's agenda. Molotov criticized the prior collusion of the U.S., Britain, and France and their deliberate attempt to split the meeting, saying: "For three people to reach an agreement with each other before the fourth person participates, and then insist that the fourth person should agree with them, this is not the way things should be done in international conferences." Mr. Molotov pointed out: "Newspaper readers are threatened by the pitiful future of this meeting, because it is generally speculated that this meeting is the 'last chance' for major powers to reach an agreement. Certain U.S. and British newspapers spare no effort to report on the attitude of the Soviet delegation with various distortions and even fabrications, preparing in advance to condemn the Soviet Union in the event of the meeting's failure. But these methods are not clever, and many methods precisely expose themselves and prove that they are sincerely obstructing the establishment of lasting democratic peace." Due to the deadlock between the two sides, a compromise decision was reached only when the discussion continued on the 26th, stipulating that the agenda of the Council of Foreign Ministers would be: (1) The Austrian treaty as the first item on the meeting's agenda, but it should be immediately handed over to the assistant foreign ministers for discussion, and they should be required to submit a report by December 2nd. (2) Preparation procedure for the German treaty. (3) Economic principles, Germany's post-war economic level, and reparations plans. (4) The form and authority of Germany's interim political organization. (5) The U.S. draft and other drafts on the demilitarization of Germany. Starting on the 27th, the foreign ministers have begun to discuss the preparation procedure for the German treaty, and the assistant foreign ministers have also begun discussing the Austrian treaty at the same time.

　　五届四外长会议揭幕
    莫洛托夫斥美英法狼狈为奸
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】伦敦讯：第五届四外长会议于二十五日在伦敦的兰开斯特大厦揭幕。与会者有莫洛托夫、马歇尔、比道尔、贝文及各外长助理多人。在贝文简短致辞后，会议即开始讨论程序问题。美、英、法帝国主义集团提出了“连每一字句都相同的同样草案”（塔斯社），并坚持先讨论奥国和约问题；苏联则力主对德国和约准备程序应为会议之第一项议程。莫洛托夫对美、英、法之事先勾结及蓄意分裂会议指责称：“三个人在没有第四者参加之前即相互成立协议，然后又坚持第四者应同意他们，这不是国际会议中应有的方法。”莫氏指出：“报纸的读者们是被这次会议可怜的前途的威吓，因为一般推测这次会议是各大国达到协议的‘最后机会’美、英某些报纸不惜以各种曲解，甚至以虚构来报导苏代表团的态度，预先准备一旦会议失败时好谴责苏联。但这些方法并不高明，许多方法恰好暴露他们自己，并证明是他们在真心地阻碍建立持久的民主和平。”由于双方意见的僵持，至二十六日继续讨论时，始获得一项折衷的决定，即规定外长会议程序为：（一）对奥和约作为会议议程之首项，但应立即交与外长助理去讨论，并限其于十二月二日提出报告。（二）对德和约准备程序。（三）经济原则，德国战后经济水平与赔偿计划。（四）德国临时政治组织的形式与权限。（五）关于德国非军国主义化的美国草案及其他草案。廿七日起，各外长已开始讨论对德和约准备程序问题，外长助理亦于同时开始讨论奥国和约。
