[From Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Taihang, 28th] In Huoshigang Village, Xingtai Fifth District, winter production has only focused on the prosperous middle peasants, neglecting hired laborers and the poor. Since the beginning of winter, 89 households in the village have engaged in transportation, earning 2.34 million yuan, greatly boosting their morale. Some time ago, district cadres went to discuss winter production with village cadres. The village cadres said, "Transportation is profitable, and households with livestock are all doing it." They also said, "Our village had a good harvest this year, so there are no problems." Recently, district cadres conducted a thorough inspection and discovered the problem. There are still 30 livestock in the village that are not being used for transportation, and these households are all hired laborers and the poor with inferior livestock and no capital. Twelve households have only enough grain to last until the end of the year, and one household is already without food. Zhang Jinsen's family of four harvested only three shi and one dou of grain, and had to repay one shi and six dou to others. The "achieved surplus after farming, high production enthusiasm" only applies to the middle peasants and a few well-off peasants. The village cadres all own mules, which are profitable for transportation, so their production enthusiasm is high, and they have forgotten the difficulties of the hired laborers and the poor. After the inspection, a cadre meeting was held to examine their mass perspective based on these facts. Branch Secretary Zhang Keshun reflected, "My family used to be poor and couldn't make a living. I fled to Shaanxi to beg for food and almost died from eating sesame seeds. The households without food now are the same as I was when I was starving." Other cadres also made self-criticisms, all expressing their determination to change their work style and help the hired laborers and the poor engage in production. After the meeting, they first distributed 620 jin of native cloth seized from the landlord Zhang Haosheng to the hired laborers and the poor who had not completely turned themselves around, as capital. They also organized households without livestock into carrying teams to transport goods to Songjiazhuang. The cooperative also lent more than 600 jin of cotton, which they had bought before, to poor women who lacked cotton, to engage in weaving.

[From Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Jinnan, 28th] The Second District of Qi Zhi has been inspecting sideline production for more than a month. The results are not significant, and there are many deviations. The main issue is that the production difficulties of the basic masses have not been resolved. Many poor peasants still cannot sustain themselves until next spring, and a few poor peasants will have difficulty getting through this winter. The reason for this problem is the leadership of the district: 1. Their position is not clear. They only make calls to action and do not delve deeply to discover the problems of the poor peasants, nor do they think about what difficulties the poor peasants have. The poor peasants have no capital, and no one pays attention to them. 2. They do not understand the difficulties of the poor peasants. The leadership themselves want to engage in large-scale production and show off, but the urgent demand of the poor peasants is to earn as they go, and they dare not take on large projects. After the inspection, they clarified that "the main goal of winter sideline production is to solve the difficulties of the poor peasants." They then convened a district-wide village cadre meeting and raised the question of who past production was for, and whether it took care of the hired and poor peasants. After discussion, they further realized that they had consistently followed the erroneous rich peasant line in leading production. For example: (1) During summer mutual aid, they mostly organized middle peasants, disliking the poor peasants because they had no farm tools and were not active in organizing them. (2) Some poor peasants participated in mutual aid teams and worked hard for a year, but because they did not calculate work points, they did not receive the compensation they deserved. In short, in the entire production effort, only middle peasants were organized, and poor peasants were not absorbed. Most of the leadership power was in the hands of the middle peasants, and the poor peasants were in a passive position, without prestige, so their difficulties could not be resolved. After self-criticism, they decided on the following tasks: (1) First, understand how many poor peasants there are in the village, whether they have sideline occupations, what their lives are like, and how much grain they lack. Use accounting methods to get through to the thinking of the poor peasants and determine household plans to survive the spring famine. (2) Organize mutual aid for sideline occupations, with poor peasants as the backbone, and absorb middle peasants to participate. (3) Based on the specific conditions of the poor peasants, do whatever they can do, without being constrained by formalities. Small or large businesses that make money are good, and strive to ensure that no one is idle and that all poor peasants are engaged in production. (4) Conscientiously and responsibly solve the living difficulties of the poor peasants. Use mutual aid methods or borrow grain and loans to solve the capital difficulties of the poor peasants, and lead the poor peasants to earn enough to eat, striving not to use or use as little of their own grain as possible before the new year.

[From Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Jinnan, 28th] Dong Xiao District in the Fourth District of Jize convened a meeting of key village cadres on the 13th of this month to summarize the sideline work of the past month. With the exception of a few villages such as Fancun, the masses in other villages were not enthusiastic about sideline production. After self-criticism, there were the following points: (1) Most of the achievements in sideline occupations in various villages were by middle peasants, with poor peasants accounting for only a quarter. (2) The poor peasants lacked capital and could only carry small loads as peddlers, and did not dare to use any of their grain. Some had three or four households jointly feeding an ox, but they could not agree with each other, and coupled with the difficulty of obtaining carts, individual households who wanted to do something could not do it. (3) The elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households in various villages did not engage in sideline occupations, mainly because the cadres did not grasp the situation tightly, abandoned their leadership responsibilities, and only mechanically assigned tasks, giving simple orders, and dealing with "tasks" perfunctorily. After this self-criticism, they realized the bias, and the village cadres resolved to solve the production difficulties of the poor peasants. The village cadres divided the work and went into each group and household to conduct a thorough inspection, striving to ensure that each male laborer earns one shi of coarse grain before the new year.

　　村干部占有好骡子对雇贫困难不关心
  　空谈转变作风不算解决问题
    【本报太行二十八日电】邢台五区火石岗村，冬季生产只注意了中农轰轰烈烈，把雇贫撇在一边不管。入冬以来，该村有八十九个牲口搞运输，他们已赚了二百三十四万元，这些户情绪很高。前些时候，区干部去和村干部谈冬季生产，村干部说：“运输能赚钱，有牲口户都干起来了”。还说：“咱村今年收成又好，反正不成问题”。最近，区干部又去深入检查，这才发现问题，全村还有三十头牲口没有运输，这些户都是雇贫，他们都是歹牲口，没资本。有十二户打的粮食只能吃到年底，有一户现在就没吃的。张金森四口人，只打了三石一斗粮，就还了别人一石六斗。所说“达到耕三余一，生产情绪很高”的，都是中农及少数翻身好的户，村干部都喂的是骡子，运输也赚钱，他们生产情绪都高，忘掉了雇贫困难。检查后，即开干部会，拿这些事实，让他们检查群众观念。支书张克顺反省说：“我家过去穷，没法生活，逃到陕西讨吃，有一次吃麻子，几乎吃死。现在没吃的户，和我过去受饿是一样的”。其他干部也都做了检讨，都说要决心转变作风，帮助雇贫搞生产。会后，首先把斗争地主张好胜的六百二十斤土布，分给没翻透身的雇贫做资金，又把没牲口户组织成扁担队到宋家庄运输。合作社也把从前买下的六百多斤花，借给缺花的贫苦妇女搞纺织。
    【本报冀南二十八日电】企之二区检查一个多月来的副业生产，成绩不很大，并发生不少偏向：主要是基本群众的生产困难未得到解决，尚有不少贫农生活维持不到明春，少数贫农今冬生活也难过去。检查原因是区的领导上：一、立场不明确，只作号召，没深入发现贫农问题，也没想到贫农有啥困难，贫农没资本没人理。二、对贫农困难没认识，领导上自己愿作大生产，抖威风，而贫农的迫切要求是现赚现吃，不敢捞大的。经过检查，明确了“冬季副业主要是解决贫农困难”，遂召开全区村干大会，提出以往生产为的谁？是否照顾雇贫农等问题？经讨论进一步认识到在领导生产中一贯走着错误的富农路线。如：（一）夏季互助时多是组织中农，嫌贫农没农具，不积极组织他们。（二）有的贫农参加了互助组，辛辛苦苦受了一年，结果因为没有计工，也没有得到应有的报酬。总之在整个生产工作中，只组织中农，没吸收贫农，领导权大部都掌握到中农手里，贫农处在被动地位，没有威信，因而他们的困难也得不到解决。经过检讨，决定以下工作：（一）首先了解本村有多少贫农，他们是否有副业，生活如何，缺多少粮食，用算帐方式打通贫农思想，来定按家计划，渡过春荒。（二）以贫农为骨干，组织互助搞副业，吸收中农参加。（三）根据贫农具体条件，会啥干啥，不拘形式，大小买卖赚钱就好，争取作到不闲一个人，贫农都生产。（四）认真负责的解决贫农生活困难，用互助办法或借粮借款解决贫农资本困难，领导贫农赚着吃，争取年前不动或者少动自己粮食。
    【本报冀南二十八日电】鸡泽四区东小区，于本月十三日召开主要村干会，总结一月来的副业工作。全小区除范村等数村外，其他村群众对副业生产情绪都不高。经检讨有以下几点：（一）各村副业成绩大部分是中农，贫农只占四分之一。（二）贫农资本短少，只能担挑小贩，有点粮食不敢动。有的是三、四户伙喂着一头牛，商量不到一块，又加上大车困难，个别户想干，亦办不到。（三）各村老弱孤寡户都没有搞副业，主要由于干部抓不紧，放弃领导责任，只机械的布置任务，单纯命令，应付“任务”。经过这一检讨，认识到偏向，村干决心解决贫农的生产困难，村干分工，挨组挨户的深入检查，争取在年前每个男劳力要赚一石粗粮。
