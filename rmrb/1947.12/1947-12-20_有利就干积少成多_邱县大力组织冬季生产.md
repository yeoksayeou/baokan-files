Do It When It's Profitable, Accumulate Little by Little
Qiu County Vigorously Organizes Winter Production

[This dispatch from our Jinnan bureau, dated the 18th] The Qiu County Party Committee convened a meeting on the fourth of this month to plan a vigorous campaign for winter production. After discussion and research, the following issues were clarified: 1. Developing county-wide winter sideline production is the primary task at hand, breaking down the ideological barriers of cadres and the masses at the county, district, and village levels. In the past, the lack of a clear focus in our work led to a passive waiting mentality among cadres throughout the county, neglecting the development of winter sideline production and allowing it to drift along on its own. Among the masses, some held the view of "suffering through the summer, idling through the winter." Because the rush to plant wheat exhausted both people and livestock, they are now taking a breather. Others held the view of "whether we harvest or not, we eat through the autumn, are poor through the summer, and rich through the winter," failing to practice thrift and indulging in excessive eating and drinking. Some are willing to engage in production but disdain small profits. According to materials collected by the County Party Committee, those holding this view are mostly middle peasants and above, while the vast majority of poor peasants are eager to engage in production. Therefore, it was decided to vigorously mobilize the poor peasants, organize poor peasant leaders, lead the middle peasants in production, and raise the middle peasants' enthusiasm for production, establishing the idea of "do it when it's profitable, accumulate little by little." 2. Establish poor peasant leadership and solve the difficulties of poor peasants. In the past, the lack of a clear class line led to the inclusion of landlords and rich peasants in mutual aid groups under the slogan of "production by all." This not only allowed landlords to benefit but, more importantly, blurred the class consciousness of the masses. After this review, the County Party Committee believes that poor peasants must lead both agricultural and sideline production. It was decided that villages with mutual aid organizations should emphasize checking past production achievements: What difficulties of the poor peasants have been solved? How much has the output of the poor peasants increased? Compare with all classes to see who benefits and who suffers. Through concrete accounting, raise the class consciousness of the poor peasants, rectify the organizations, squeeze out the landlords, transform the leadership composition, and let the poor peasants truly be the masters and become the backbone of production. In villages without mutual aid organizations, vigorously organize poor peasant production, establish poor peasant leadership, and lead middle peasant production. 3. It is clear that this winter's sideline production will focus on handicrafts such as textile, oil mills, flour mills, and various farm tool factories, combined with winter manure accumulation and firewood gathering. All villages are called upon to do whatever they can according to their specific conditions, and do whatever they can according to their age and skills, regardless of how large or small the profit is, as long as it is profitable. In these two months of winter, we must ensure that there are no idle people in every household. In women's textile production, continue to implement the slogan of "sell less cotton, sell more cloth, turn cotton into cloth, turn cloth into money, turn money into grain," and organize a large number of spinners and weavers, mobilize skilled workers to lead apprentices, and generally improve spinning and weaving techniques, so that quantity and quality advance simultaneously. This winter, all machines must be put into operation, so that people stop but machines don't. In the leadership of the county, district, and village, we must focus on key points, create experience, let the masses see the benefits with their own eyes, and promote the overall situation. Create a great movement in all villages of the county, with the elderly gathering manure, children gathering firewood and manure, and young adults engaged in various sideline productions.

    有利就干积少成多
    邱县大力组织冬季生产
    【本报冀南十八日电】邱县县委会于本月四日集会，计划大力开展冬季生产。经大家讨论研究，明确了以下几个问题：一、开展全县冬季副业生产为眼前的主要工作，打破县、区、村各级干部和群众的思想障碍。因过去工作中心不明确，在全县干部中产生了单纯的等待思想，忽视了今冬副业生产的开展，使其形成自流。在群众中，有的存在着“受一夏，闲一冬”思想。因突击种麦人畜都很累，现在松一口气。有的存在着“收不收，吃一秋，穷一夏，富一冬”的思想，不细水长流，大吃大喝。有的愿意干生产，但存在着不赶小利的思想。经县委根据现有的材料了解，认为存在这种思想的多是中农以上的成份，而绝大多数贫农是要求生产的。所以决定大力发动起贫农，组织贫农领导骨干，带领中农生产，提高中农生产情绪，树立“有利就干，积少成多”的思想。二、树立贫农领导，解决贫农困难。因过去阶级路线不明确，在“全民生产”口号下，将地主富农吸收进互助组，这样不但使地主沾了光，更重要的是模糊了群众的阶级意识。县委会经过这次检讨，认为农副业都必须树立贫农领导；决定在有互助组织的村庄，强调检查过去生产成绩：解决了贫农那些困难？贫农增加了多少产量？与各阶层对比看看，究竟谁沾光？谁吃亏？从具体算帐中，提高贫农阶级觉悟，进行整顿组织，挤出地主，改造领导成份，让贫农真正当家，成为生产骨干。在没有互助组织的村庄，大力组织贫农生产，树立贫农领导，带领中农生产。三、明确今冬副业以纺织、油坊、粉坊和各种农具工厂等手工业为主，结合冬季积肥、拾柴，并号召各村翻身农民根据本村具体条件，有啥干啥，根据年龄、技术，能干啥就干啥，不管利大利小，只要有利就可干。今冬两个月中，要作到家家无闲人。在妇女纺织中，继续贯彻“少卖花，多卖布，棉变布，布变钱，钱变粮”的口号，大量组织纺妇织妇，动员能手带领徒弟，普遍提高纺织技术，使量与质同时并进。在今冬要把全部机子开动起来，做到人停机不停。在县、区、村的领导上，要抓紧基点，创造经验，使群众亲眼见到好处，推动全盘。使全县各村，造成老年拾粪，儿童拾柴又拾粪，青壮年搞各种副业生产的大运动。
