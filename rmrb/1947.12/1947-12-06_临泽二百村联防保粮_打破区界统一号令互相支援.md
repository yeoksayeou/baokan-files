　　Linze Two Hundred Villages Joint Defense to Protect Grain
    Breaking District Boundaries, Unified Command, Mutual Support
    [Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 4th] Two hundred villages in the Linze border area of the Second District are organizing a joint defense to protect their fields and grain. The self-defense momentum is enormous, greatly shocking the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents and returning landlord corps. Joint defenses in the northern and central parts of the Fifth District and villages close to the enemy, as well as the Third District, have been established. The Sixth District is currently brewing its establishment. After a 20,000-person joint defense review conference was held in a certain village on the 15th of this month, the masses were extremely excited. The conference proposed unified commands, close communication between joint defenses, and no district boundaries. Road passes are implemented throughout the county, and anyone without a road pass is detained. It calls for actively dividing the autumn harvest and land, consolidating the joint defense organization, and immediately starting to transform the terrain. The organization of the joint defense is generally one joint defense team per sub-district. They have all formulated their own covenants: standing guard during the day to check pedestrians and transmit intelligence; striking the watch at night, divided into mobile and fixed shifts; villages checking each other's watch, or using a pass-the-token method. Some sub-districts even have patrol troops to help check the watch. In case of any situation, the drum is used as an order, and after each village hears the order, they immediately line up and set off to reinforce the village that issued the order. Those who violate the rules and do not change after education will be subject to certain penalties. In addition, there are two resolutions: (1) Immediately remove the wheels after the crops in the fields are harvested to prevent them from being used by the enemy. (2) Immediately hide grain, dig ditches outside the village, and block the streets with transverse walls. The reason why the joint defense can be organized is primarily because the masses have realized that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are about to collapse, that they will not last long in Caozhou (Heze), that the returning landlord corps is not strong, and that the self-defense struggle can certainly achieve victory. Active elements in the land reform have become the backbone of the joint defense.

　　临泽二百村联防保粮
    打破区界统一号令互相支援
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】二分区临泽边缘区二百村保田保粮，组织联防，自卫声势浩大，使蒋匪特务还乡团大为震惊。五区北部、中部和靠敌近的村庄及三区联防都以建立起来。六区正在酝酿建立。本月十五日，在某村举行两万人的联防检阅大会后，群众极其兴奋。大会上提出统一号令，密切联络联防，不分区界。全县实行路条，无路条一律扣押。号召积极分秋分田，巩固联防组织，立即着手改造地形。联防的组织，一般是一小区一个联防队。他们自己都定出了公约，白天站岗，检查行人，传送情报。夜间打更，分游动与固定两班，村与村互相查更，或用传签办法。有的小区更有巡逻部队帮助查更。如有情况，以鼓为令，各村听令后，马上整队出发，增援发令之村。如有违犯者，经教育不改，即受到一定的处罚。此外还有二项决议：（一）地里庄稼收完后，立即卸掉车轮，免被敌人使用。（二）立即藏粮，村外挖路沟，街上堵横墙。联防之所以能组织起来，首先是群众已认识到蒋匪快要完蛋，在曹州（菏泽）撑不长，还乡团不顶打，自卫斗争一定可以取得胜利。在土改中的积极分子，已成为联防的骨干。
