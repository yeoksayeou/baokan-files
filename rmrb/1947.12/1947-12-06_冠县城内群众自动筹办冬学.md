(This dispatch from our Jinnan office, dated the 3rd) The masses in the North Street of Guanxian County are not only organizing sideline production this winter, but have also voluntarily established winter schools. After the harvest, the masses said, "Now that the fields are clear and the threshing grounds are empty, it would be great to establish winter schools every year and go to school in the evenings to listen to the news or learn to read!" Village cadres immediately convened meetings of peasant women to discuss and prepare for the establishment of winter schools in groups. Based on the opinions of the masses in each group, the following methods were determined: 1. Two volunteer teachers will focus on political education centered on current victory news and the reasons for liberation, followed by group discussions. For literacy learning, the old, lifeless textbooks will be discarded. Instead, groups will be organized according to existing production structures (those in the same trade or industry), and the principle of "teaching what is needed and learning what is used" will be implemented. The teaching materials will be compiled by everyone, and a blackboard newspaper (every two issues every five days) will be established to publicize model deeds in the village and encourage everyone's enthusiasm. 2. Generally, men and women between the ages of ten and fifty should attend the winter school. However, those over fifty years old can participate freely. The study time is two hours every evening. Women gather in groups every afternoon to study. 3. In terms of organization and leadership, it must be the responsibility of poor and lower-middle peasant cadres who are enthusiastic about education. The public blackboard will be made from old plaques from temples. All groups are now well prepared.

　　冠县城内群众自动筹办冬学
    【本报冀南三日电】冠县城内北街，今冬除组织副业生产外，群众自动成立冬学。收耕毕群众说：“现在地净场光了，每年都成立冬学，晚上到学里听念个报或学个字多好！”村干马上召开农妇会，分组酝酿办冬学。根据各组群众提的意见，确定了以下几个办法：一、两个义务教员，以目前胜利消息翻身道理为政治教育中心，讲后大家讨论。识字学习，去掉过去死课本，根据原有生产组织（同行同业的），划为一组，实行“用啥学啥就教啥”。教材是大家编，并建立黑板报（五天两期），以广播本村模范事迹，鼓励大家情绪。二、一般确定十至五十的男女群众都入冬学。但五十岁以上者，自由参加。学习时间每晚二小时。妇女每天下午分组集合学习。三、在组织领导上，须是热心教育的贫农村干负责，大众黑板用庙上的旧匾。现在各股已筹备妥当。
