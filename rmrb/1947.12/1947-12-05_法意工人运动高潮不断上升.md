The globally watched climax of the French and Italian workers' movement has been rising continuously for the past week.

The French labor unrest, which has persisted for three weeks, has now developed into a general strike in various industries. As of the 26th, the number of strikers has exceeded two million, an unprecedented feat in the history of the French workers' movement. The magnificent power of the strike has paralyzed France's modern railway and highway network, brought most industries to a standstill, and plunged the entire French economy into chaos. This serious situation has greatly shocked and disturbed the French reactionary authorities. The Schuman cabinet, entrusted with the mission of suppressing the labor unrest, has been meeting all day, striving to devise countermeasures. He once cunningly used delaying tactics, attempting to shake the workers' determination to struggle by temporarily agreeing to some of their demands and exchanging it for the workers' "immediate resumption of work," thereby buying time to prepare for a ferocious attack on the working class. However, this conspiracy of the reactionaries completely failed. Not only did the trade unions of the twenty important enterprises participating in the strike reject Schuman's plan, but also the government employees' union, which has nearly two million members and had not yet gone on strike, saw through the trick and responded to the strike. This will greatly develop the French labor unrest and cause it to surge across the country.

The anti-fascist movement in Italy continues to develop and deepen. In the past week alone, the number of strikers in southern Italy has surged to 2.5 million. Terrified by the powerful force of the masses, the landlords in the provinces of Apulia, Basilicata, Grande Landò, and Forlì had to bow their heads and accept the wage increase demands of agricultural workers, and the strike ended victoriously. However, the general strike of anti-fascist elements and against landlords and reactionary authorities in the provinces of Cosenza and Cardinale in southern Italy is just beginning. In northern Italy, the anti-fascist struggle is unfolding deeply. If the agricultural workers in the south, after the victorious end of the strike, continue to consolidate the unity of their ranks to avoid being fooled by the landlords, it shows the workers' high level of vigilance; then the congress of 7,000 worker representatives of the worker management production committee movement held in Milan marks the unparalleled bravery and ingenuity of the Italian working class in recognizing its historical mission and transforming social institutions. The meeting called for the establishment of worker management production committees throughout the country and in all enterprises, demanding that workers implement control over industry. The meeting also urged the workers' committee to "launch the most effective action against the reactionaries in the Constituent Assembly and throughout the country." At the same time, the recent plenary session of the Italian Socialist Party Central Committee resolved to expand joint action with the Italian Communist Party, which is of great significance for strengthening the united struggle of the Italian working people.

However, the struggle of the French and Italian working people still needs to overcome many obstacles on the road to victory. Especially because the French and Italian reactionaries are desperately supported by their master, American imperialism. It is reported that the US Mediterranean Fleet is preparing to concentrate in the Italian port of Naples, seemingly with fierce momentum. In his talks with Bidault, Marshall allowed the French reactionaries to receive "all possible assistance." At the same time, under the instruction of the United States, Schuman dared to openly announce that he was prepared to "use force" to deal with striking workers. However, the collusion between the United States and the French and Italian reactionaries, in addition to further exposing the hideous face of American imperialism vowing to be the enemy of the people, will never deter the fighting will of the French and Italian working people.

The fifth postwar foreign ministers' conference opened in London last week. The initial situation of the foreign ministers' conference gives people the impression that the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, as it did in the UN General Assembly, is trying to impose its will on others. For example, regarding the discussion of procedural issues, the United States, Britain, and France insisted on putting the secondary Austrian peace treaty before the main German peace treaty. At the same time, the drafts of the US, British, and French delegations were identical word for word. This is obviously a conspiracy in which the three parties pre-negotiated and then forced the fourth party to accept. However, due to the Soviet Union's insistence that the German issue must be discussed first, a compromise proposal was passed, namely, the Austrian peace treaty was listed as the first item on the agenda, but handed over to the Assistant Foreign Ministers for discussion, and the German peace treaty was listed as the second item, but discussed by the Foreign Ministers themselves. It can be asserted that this foreign ministers' conference will undoubtedly launch a fierce struggle, because, as Molotov said, there are two opposing policies: the democratic peace policy and the imperialist policy. Because the US and Britain's policy of splitting Germany, protecting the remnants of German fascism, and using western Germany as the basis for the Marshall Plan to enslave Europe is fundamentally incompatible with the Soviet Union's policy of realizing a unified and democratic Germany and eliminating the remnants of German fascism. Therefore, whether the foreign ministers' conference can obtain an agreement beneficial to peace will depend on the future attitude of the United States and Britain.

In the Far East, the Vietnamese people's national liberation war is proceeding victoriously. The Vietnamese Democratic Army launched a partial counter-offensive in the north and south regions at the end of last month. They repeatedly defeated the French army in places such as Tu Sa and Lang Son. Now, French imperialism is attempting to sign a "truce agreement" with Bảo Đại and organize a puppet government headed by Bảo Đại, in an attempt to shake the Vietnamese people's determination to wage a war of independence and self-defense. However, a spokesman for the French colonial department could not help but admit that the Vietnamese Democratic Government led by Ho Chi Minh "has great prestige." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 法意工人运动高潮不断上升

　　法意工人运动高潮不断上升
    举世瞩目的法意工人运动的高潮，一周来在不断上升。
    坚持了三个星期的法国工潮，现在已发展成为各业的总罢工。截至二十六日止，罢工人数已突破二百万，这是法国工人运动史上空前的壮举。罢工的威力如此雄伟，使法国现代化的铁路公路网陷于瘫痪，使工业大部停顿，使法国的整个经济生活处于混乱之境。这种严重情况，使法国反动当局大为震惊和不安。奉有镇压工潮使命的舒曼新阁，整日集会，力谋对策。他曾狡施缓兵之计，妄图以暂时答应工人的部分要求，来动摇工人的斗争决心，并换取工人的“立即复工”，借此争取时间，以退为进，准备向工人阶级实行凶恶的猛攻。但是反动派的这种阴谋完全破产了。不仅参加罢工的二十个重要企业的工会拒斥了舒曼的计谋，而且尚未罢工而拥有近二百万会员的政府雇员联盟，也洞烛其奸起而响应罢工。这势将使法国工潮更大大发展而奔腾澎湃于全国。
    意大利的反法西斯运动继续发展与深入。上周内仅意国南部罢工人数即猛增至二百五十万。慑于群众的强大威力，阿蒲里亚、巴希里卡塔、大兰多、佛尔斯等省的地主们不得不低头接受农业工人的增资要求，罢工因而胜利结束。然而，南意的科森萨、卡丁嘉洛等省的反对法西斯分子、反对地主与反动当局的总罢工，则正在开始。在北意，反法西斯斗争正深入的展开着。如果说南方农业工人在胜利结束罢工后，继续巩固自己队伍的团结，以免上地主的当，表示了工人的高度警觉性；那么，在米兰举行的工人管理生产委员会运动的七千工人代表大会，就标志着意大利工人阶级，在认清自己历史使命后进行改造社会机构的无比英勇与机智。该会号召在全国各地及一切企业中成立工人管理生产委员会，要求由工人对工业实施管制。会议并敦促工人委员会“在立宪议会中及全国范围中对反动派展开最有效的行动”。同时，最近举行的意社会党中央全会，决议扩大与意共的联合行动，这对加强意大利劳动人民的团结斗争，是有极重要意义的。
    但是，法意劳动人民的斗争，在走向胜利途中还须克服不少障碍。特别是因为法意反动派是得到其主子美帝国主义的拼命支持。据传美国驻地中海舰队已准备集中意大利的那不勒斯港，似乎来势凶凶，马歇尔在与比道尔的会谈中，则允许给法国反动派以“一切可能的援助，”同时，在美国的授意下，舒曼竟胆敢公开宣布准备“采用武力”对付罢工工人。但是，美国与法意反动派的狼狈为奸，除了更加暴露美帝国主义誓与人民为敌的狰狞面目外，是决不能吓退法意劳动人民的斗争意志的。
    战后第五届外长会议，上周已在伦敦揭幕了。外长会议的最初情景，给人们以一种印象：即以美国为首的帝国主义集团，仍如联合国大会上表现的一样，力图以自己的意志强加于人。例如，关于程序问题的讨论，美英法就坚持把次要的对奥和约排在主要的对德国和约之前。同时，美英法代表团的草案又是一字一句都相同的。这显然是三者预告商议好，然后强迫第四者接受的一种阴谋。但由于苏联坚持必须首先讨论德国问题，结果通过了一个折衷案，即对奥和约列为议程首项，但交给外长助理去讨论，对德和约列为第二项，但由外长亲自讨论。可以断言，这次外长会议无疑将展开激烈的斗争，因为如莫洛托夫所说，存在着有两种对抗的政策：民主的和平政策与帝国主义的政策。因为美英之分裂德国、保护德国法西斯残余、以德国西部为马歇尔奴役欧洲计划的基础的政策，是和苏联之实现统一民主的德国、消灭德国法西斯残余的政策根本相抵触的。因此，外长会议能否获得有利于和平的协议，将取决于今后美英的态度。
    在远东，越南人民的民族解放战争正胜利进行中，越南民主军于上月底在南北地区开始局部反攻。在吐萨城、谅山等地屡创法军。现法帝国主义妄图与保大签订“停战协定，”并组织以保大为首的傀儡政府，阴谋以此来动摇越南人民进行独立自卫战争的决心。但法殖民地部发言人也不能不承认：胡志明领导下的越南民主政府“有极大的威信。”（新华社）
