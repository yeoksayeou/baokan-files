　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Dispatch: After the US, British, and French imperialist blocs single-handedly sabotaged the Foreign Ministers' Conference, they immediately began to engage in the conspiratorial activities of establishing a West German government according to their pre-determined plan. According to Agence France-Presse: since Molotov left London on the 16th, Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault have held a series of secret meetings. It is said: the content is kept secret, but according to Reuters: experts from the United States, Britain, and France are scheduled to meet in Washington on January 15th next year to discuss the merger of the three western occupation zones. The so-called draft constitution of the West German provisional government has long been drafted by "German politicians" in the US occupation zone under the direction of the United States, and will be approved at the upcoming meeting of the state premiers, attended by Clay and Robertson, the US and British occupation zone commanders. The United States has also printed new banknotes for use in Germany as the "economic foundation" for establishing a West German government. Before the merger of the three western occupation zones, Britain further succumbed to the United States, agreeing to the complete merger of the US and British occupation zones first. The two sides also signed a new agreement on the 17th, stipulating that the United States would bear seven-eighths of the occupation costs, but all work in the occupation zone would be "dictated by the United States" (United Press). Former British War Secretary Belisha fully admitted on the 17th that the purpose of the US and British sabotage of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was to "merge the German land west of the Elbe River into a United States of Western Europe modeled after the United States." The reactionary newspapers and news agencies of the US and Britain also clamored loudly, and the New York Times, the mouthpiece of US imperialism, applauded the "achievements" of the United States in sabotaging international cooperation on the 19th, saying: "The cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States in international affairs, which began with Yalta, has now officially come to an end." The US, Britain, and other's deliberate conspiracy to split international cooperation is thus even more exposed.
    This act of dismembering Germany has aroused the indignation of the German people. At a mass rally of the working class recently held in Bremen, Herbert and Riemann, leaders of the Socialist Unity Party and the Communist Party in the western occupation zone, called for the unity of all socialists in Germany and urged the working class to devote themselves to the unification of Germany. Grotewohl, chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, denounced the United States and others for sabotaging the Foreign Ministers' Conference, opposed the plan to split Germany by merging the two or three occupation zones, and condemned the treacherous acts of Schumacher (leader of the Social Democratic Party) and Kaiser (leader of the Christian Democratic Union). On the 18th, Deutsche Nachrichten published a letter to the people of the whole country from the Berlin Secretariat of the Socialist Unity Party, pointing out: "The US imperialist sabotage of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has made Germany face the imminent threat of being divided and Berlin no longer being the capital of Germany." The letter strongly criticized the Social Democratic Party leadership for rejecting the policy of 15,000 Social Democrats demanding cooperation between the two working-class parties, trying to include the western part of Berlin in the western occupation zone, and turning Berlin into a forward position for western monopoly capitalists. The letter pointed out: the so-called "independent trade union" led by the Social Democratic Party, with the support of foreign forces, is committed to splitting the trade union movement, blindly following Schumacher's treasonous policy of splitting Germany. The letter finally demanded that the German people decide their fate through a national referendum, and called on the people to fight for the unification of Germany, for democracy, and for socialism.

　　美公然破坏国际合作
  　捣散外长会后着手分裂德国
  　竟把“西部德国”的钞票都印出来了
  　德国人民表示义愤不容许国家被分割
    【综合新华社陕北电】美英法帝国主义集团一手破坏外长会议后，立即按照预定计划开始从事建立西德政府之阴谋活动。据法新社讯：自莫洛托夫十六日离伦敦后，马歇尔、贝文、比道尔曾举行一连串的秘密会议。据称：内容秘而不宣，但据路透社透露：美英法三国专家定明年一月十五日在华盛顿开会，以讨论西部三占领区合并问题。而所谓西德临时政府的宪草，则早已在美国的指使下，由美占区之“德国政治家”拟出，并将在行将举行的美英占区司令克莱及罗伯逊参加的各州总理会议上予以批准。美国并已印就供德国使用的新钞票，作为建立西德政府之“经济基础”。在西部三占区进行合并之前，英进一步向美屈服，同意美英二占区先进行完全合并。双方并于十七日签订了一项新协定，规定由美国担负占领费八分之七，但占领区的一切工作均由“美国发号施令”（合众社）。英国前陆军大臣倍立厦于十七日完全供认美英破坏外长会议的目的是把“易北河以西之德国土地合并入以美国为蓝本之西欧合众国”。美英的反动报纸和通讯社也大肆叫嚣，美帝国主义喉舌纽约时报十九日竟对美国破坏国际合作之“成就”拍手称欢说：“以雅尔塔为开端的苏美在国际事务中的合作，目前是正式告终了”。美英等蓄意分裂国际合作之诡计，由此更暴露无遗。
    此种肢解德国之举，已引起德国人民的义愤。最近在不来梅举行的工人阶级群众大会上，统一社会党及西占区共产党领袖赫伯特及瑞曼呼吁德国一切社会主义者的团结，敦促工人阶级致力于德国的统一。统一社会党主席格罗提渥痛斥美国等破坏外长会议，反对二占区或三占区合并的分裂德国计划，并斥责舒马赫（社会民主党领袖）、凯塞（基督教民主联盟领袖）之流的叛卖行为。十八日，德意志新闻发表柏林统一社会党秘书处告全国人民书，指出：“美帝国主义的破坏外长会议，使德国有被分割与柏林不再成为德国首都的迫切威胁”。该书力斥社会民主党领导上拒绝一万五千社会民主党人要求两个工人阶级政党合作的方针，力图将柏林西部地区包括进西部占领区，并变柏林为西部垄断资本家的先头阵地。该书指出：受社会民主党领导的所谓“独立职工会”，在外力支援下致力于分裂职工运动，盲目的遵奉着舒马赫的分裂德国的卖国政策。该书最后要求德国人民经过全国表决来决定他们的命运，并号召人民为德国统一，为民主及社会主义而奋斗。
