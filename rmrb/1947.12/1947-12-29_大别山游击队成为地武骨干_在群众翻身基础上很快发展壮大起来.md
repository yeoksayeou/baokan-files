Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 27th: The Dabie Mountain People's Guerrilla forces have expanded five to ten times in the three months since joining forces with Liu Deng's counter-offensive army, becoming a powerful local people's armed force. These People's Guerrilla forces remained in the Dabie Mountain area to persist in guerrilla warfare after the main force of the Central Plains Liberation Army broke through last year. In the Hubei-Henan border region, there was the Jingfu Brigade led by He Yaobang and Liu Mingbang. Operating in the Huanggang, Yingshan, and Luotian areas was the Qi Shaochuan Brigade, led by Huanggang people's leader Qi Shaochuan. Active along the Yangtze River bank in Qichun, Huangmei, and Guangji was the Yi Peng Brigade. On the Anhui western front, the force was a combination of the original New Fourth Army's 7th Division, 2nd Division, and 5th Division's guerrilla forces, with relatively strong power, led by Generals Gui Linqi and Liu Changyi. These guerrilla forces had persisted in the most serious struggles under Chiang Kai-shek's cruel "encirclement and suppression" for the past year, experiencing difficulties and hardships, drilling through mountain caves, climbing snow ditches, enduring hunger and cold, fighting the few against the many, and unyielding. Chiang Kai-shek had exhausted all methods to try to wipe them out, but all failed. There was the so-called "Guangshan policy," searching and suppressing mountains, burning all trees and bushes; there was the so-called "siege policy," destroying remote small villages, blocking all roads leading to the mountains; and there was the rigorous implementation of the "five-household responsibility system," special agent control, as well as bribery and enticement, etc. However, because the People's Guerrilla forces maintained close ties with the broad masses of people, and with the masses' cover and help, not only were they not wiped out by Chiang Kai-shek, but they grew larger and larger. They had led the people in various struggles against conscription, grain requisition, and levies. The Jingfu Guerrilla Brigade, in November of last year, had protected hundreds of young men and women in the Tiantai Mountain area from escaping Chiang Kai-shek's conscription, and captured township and bao personnel who were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to the countryside to conscript soldiers. In Huanggang and along the Yangtze River bank, the People's Guerrilla forces controlled Chiang Kai-shek's bao and jia heads; in some areas, they used covert forms to lead the masses to oppose exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, achieving victory. In the Qianshan and Yuexi areas of western Anhui, people's guerrilla bases were established, and patriotic and democratic regimes were established. These guerrilla forces greatly developed in the spring and summer of this year. After joining forces with the southward counter-offensive army, the people rose up to join the army, and their strength was further expanded. Especially in the areas where the masses began to turn over and fight struggles after the victory at Gaoshanpu, the development was even more rapid, and the equipment was greatly strengthened, all possessing heavy weapons, such as heavy machine guns, 60mm mortars, and mortars, becoming the backbone of the local armed forces.
Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 26th: Local troops of the Western Anhui Military Region annihilated more than 100 enemies in mid-month. On the 20th, our army defeated a part of Chiang Kai-shek's security team in Mapu, northwest of Huoshan, capturing 60 people and guns. On the 13th, 30 some Chiang Kai-shek bandits, including the battalion commander of the 108th Brigade of the 25th Division, were killed or wounded 30 miles west of Lujiang. On the 12th, a part of Chiang Kai-shek's local bandits was annihilated in Wuqi River, southwest of Huoshan, capturing 13 people, including the battalion commander, and 13 guns.

　　大别山游击队成为地武骨干
  　在群众翻身基础上很快发展壮大起来
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线廿七日电】大别山区人民游击队自与刘邓反攻大军汇合后，三个月来，已扩大五倍至十倍，成为强有力的人民地方武装。这些人民游击队，自去年中原解放军主力突围后，就留在大别山区坚持游击战争。在鄂豫边的是何耀榜、刘名榜所率领的经扶大队，在黄冈、英山、罗田一带活动的是漆少川大队，领导人是黄冈人民领袖漆少川。在蕲（春）黄（梅）广（济）活跃于长江岸边的是易鹏大队。皖西方面是原新四军七师、二师及五师三部分游击部队合成，力量比较强大，领导人是桂林栖、刘昌义两将军，这些游击部队一年来在蒋匪残酷的“清剿”下，坚持了最严重的斗争，历经艰难困苦，钻山洞、爬雪沟，忍饥挨冻，以少敌众，不屈不挠。蒋匪曾用尽一切方法妄想把他们扑灭，都失败了；有所谓：“光山政策”，分山搜剿，烧尽树木草丛；有所谓“困锁政策”，毁灭偏僻小村，封锁断绝一切通山道路；又厉行“五家连坐”，特务控制，以及收买利诱等等；但人民游击队由于和广大群众密切联系，在群众掩护帮助下，不但没有被蒋匪扑灭，反而越来发展得越大。他们曾领导人民进行抗丁抗粮抗款的各种斗争，经扶游击队在去年十一月间，曾掩护天台山一带数百青壮年逃避蒋匪拉丁，并捕捉蒋匪下乡抽丁的乡保人员，在黄冈和长江岸边，人民游击队控制着蒋匪保甲长；在有些地区用隐蔽形式领导群众反对苛捐杂税，取得胜利。在皖西潜山、岳西一带，则建立了人民游击根据地，并且树立了爱国民主政权。这些游击部队，在今年春夏之交，曾大为发展。到了和南下反攻大军汇合后，人民又蜂起参军，力量更加扩大。特别在高山铺大捷后，群众开始翻身斗争的地区，更飞跃发展，装备也大大加强，都拥有重火器，如重机枪、六○小炮、迫击炮等，成了各地方武装的基干。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十六日电】皖西军区地方部队本月中旬歼敌百余名。二十日我军在霍山西北之麻埠击溃蒋匪保安队一部，俘获人枪各六十余。十三日在庐江以西三十里之处，毙伤蒋匪二十五师一○八旅营长以下三十余人。十二日在霍山西南之舞旗河歼蒋匪土顽一部，俘获大队长以下十三人及枪十三支。
