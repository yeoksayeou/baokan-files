　　Chiang and the U.S. Conspire to Create Floods; The People Have the Power to Control the Yellow River
　　Wang Huayun Summarizes the Struggle to Restore the Dikes
　　[Report from this newspaper in the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 22nd] Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, recently summarized the great achievements in controlling the Yellow River and restoring the dikes over the past year at the Anlan Conference. Director Wang first pointed out with the excitement of a victor that Chiang and the U.S.'s sinister plot to return the Yellow River to its old course and flood the liberated areas has been a miserable failure. The reactionaries always like to underestimate the power of the people, and now it is time for them to learn a lesson. He stated: The struggle against the Yellow River can be divided into three stages: The first stage was from March to July of last year, when Chiang Kai-shek attempted to block the Garden Mouth by surprise before the great flood, and U.S. imperialism fully supported it through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). All the machinery, automobiles, wooden stakes used for blocking the opening, as well as the canned food and cigarettes consumed by the personnel involved in blocking the opening, were all supplied by them. Under the meticulous design of American technicians, two stone factories were established in Luwangfen, and Chiang Kai-shek even proposed "rather stop military transportation than stop stone transportation." However, the people of Ji-Lu-Yu broke the illusion that "the water will not come," and raised a just call for self-defense and self-rescue, which dealt a blow to Chiang Kai-shek's ferocity in blocking the opening, won the sympathy of national public opinion, and forced Chiang Kai-shek to change his trick and sign the Heze-Nanjing Agreement. The second stage was from July of last year to March of this year, during the blocking of the opening. Chiang Kai-shek signed the agreement with one hand and tore it up with the other. He only made empty promises regarding funds for the relief of residents in the riverbed and machinery for dike restoration, and actually made things difficult in every possible way and delayed the allocation. At the same time, he secretly and actively accelerated the blocking of the opening. Zhao Shouyu, director of the original Blocking and Restoration Bureau, was dismissed and replaced by Zhu Guangcai, who was strictly ordered to complete the task within a time limit, and his conspiracy was accelerated by "those who disobey will be killed." Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Dubi, and others personally went to supervise the work, and even dismantled the roadbed of the Xin (xiang)-Bian (Kaifeng) road, which shows their ruthlessness. The people of Ji-Lu-Yu exposed this conspiracy and heroically rose up to save themselves. 30,000 workers went to the dikes, established various river control organizations, and began to repair the dikes and restore the embankments. The third stage was from the blocking of the opening until now. All the disguises of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek have been completely exposed. They tore up the agreement, ordered the expulsion of our representative stationed in Kaifeng, and stopped our upstream hydrological radio contact. Chiang and the U.S. planes wantonly bombed and strafed along the river, killing 2,406 people including Wang Hancai, the head of the Changyuan section, and invaded the south bank with a large army, constantly obstructing our emergency rescue and dike restoration projects. After the withdrawal of UNRRA, Chiang Kai-shek openly breached the Guantai Dam, which was extremely critical. The people of Ji-Lu-Yu launched an unprecedented self-rescue movement for dike restoration, emergency rescue, and river protection, and finally repelled the Yellow River water. In total, more than 10 million cubic meters of earth were used, more than 154,000 cubic meters of stone were contributed for emergency rescue, and 5 million catties of straw were used, making the 1,800-mile-long dike extremely strong. It blocked the rolling Yellow River and safely passed the great flood. In this year of intense, fierce, and arduous struggle to control the Yellow River, the political consciousness and spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the emancipated peasants have been fully demonstrated. People inside the dike repaired the dike, and people outside the dike also repaired the dike. Young and strong people went to the dike, and old and weak women also went to the dike. Repairing the dike did not require wages, and even the surplus grain from their own homes was used on the dike. They completely regarded the Yellow River control as their own business, regardless of any sacrifice or hardship. Therefore, although the construction time was short, the dike foundation on the north bank has caught up with the highest level of the 24th year of the Republic of China. This fact proves that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people have the power to overcome everything, and the dangerous Yellow River has to succumb to the people. Director Wang finally called on the attending heroes and models to exchange experiences, thoroughly crush the conspiracies of Chiang and the U.S., and ensure that the Yellow River will never harm the people.

　　蒋美阴谋造水灾人民有力治黄河
  　王化云总结复堤斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫廿二日电】黄河水利委员会主任王化云顷在安澜大会上总结一年来治黄复堤的伟大成绩。王主任首以胜利者的兴奋口吻，指出蒋美借黄河归故，放水淹没解放区的狠毒阴谋已遭惨败。反动派总喜欢过低估计人民的力量，现在应该是他们得到教训的时候了。彼称：黄河斗争可分三个阶段：第一阶段从去年三月到七月，蒋贼企图在大泛以前，以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，堵塞花园口，美帝国主义则通过联总全力予以支持。举凡堵口用的机器、汽车、木桩以及堵口人员食用的罐头、纸烟，悉数供给。在美国技师精心设计下，璐王坟成立了两个石料厂，蒋贼更提出“宁停军运，不停运石”。然冀鲁豫人民却因此打破了“水不会来”的幻想，响起自卫自救的正义呼声，打击了蒋匪堵口的凶焰，争取了全国舆论的同情，使蒋匪被迫改换了骗术，签订了菏泽与南京协定。第二阶段是从去年七月到今年三月堵口。蒋匪一手签订协定，一手撕毁。对救济河床居民的款项，复堤用的机器，只作空头诺言，实际上则百般刁难，迟迟不拨。与此同时，暗中积极加紧堵口，原堵复局赵守钰被撤职，换以朱光彩，严令限期完成，并以“违命者杀”来加速其阴谋的实现。蒋匪国防部长白崇禧、水利部长薛笃弼等并亲往督工，更拆除了新（乡）汴（开封）路路基，其狠毒可见。冀鲁豫人民揭破了这个阴谋，英勇奋起自救，三万民工走上河堤，建立各种治河组织，开始修坝复堤。第三阶段从堵口直到现在，美蒋一切假面具已暴露无遗，撕毁协定，下令驱逐我驻开封代表，停止我上游水情电台联系，蒋美飞机沿河滥肆轰炸扫射、捕杀我长垣段长王汉才以下二千四百零六人，并以大军侵占南岸，不断阻扰我抢险复堤工程。联总撤退后，蒋匪又公开扒开贯台大堤，危急万分，冀鲁豫人民掀起史无前例的复堤、抢险、护河自救运动，卒将黄水击退。总计前后用土达千万余方，抢险献石达十五万四千余方，秸料五百万斤，使一千八百里长的堤坝，坚固异常。挡住了滚滚黄水，安然渡过大泛。在此一年紧张、激烈、艰苦的治黄斗争中，充分显示出翻身农民的政治觉悟和团结互助的精神。堤里的人修堤，堤外的人也修堤，青壮年上堤，老弱妇女也上堤，修堤不要工价，还把自己家里节余的粮都用到堤上。完全把治黄看成自己的事，不顾任何牺牲、困苦，故修筑时间虽短，北岸堤基已赶上民国二十四年最高的水平。此一事实证明：在共产党领导下，人民有力量战胜一切，凶险的黄河亦不得不屈伏在人民脚下。王主任最后号召到会英雄模范交流经验，彻底粉碎蒋美阴谋，使黄河永远不能为患人民。
