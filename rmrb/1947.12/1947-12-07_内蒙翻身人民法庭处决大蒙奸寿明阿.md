Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. The liberated people of the West Khoshuu Banner in Inner Mongolia established a people's court to try the great Mongolian traitor Shou Ming'a, the Special Commissioner and Banner Chief Bayan Namuer, and the feudal tyrant landlord Qing Wusuketu. After six days of trial, based on the grievances of more than 270 people and the resolution of the people's representatives of the entire banner, the people's court sentenced Shou Ming'a, who was guilty of heinous crimes, to capital punishment.

During the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, Shou Ming'a colluded successively with the thief of the country Yuan Shikai and the reactionary warlord Zhang Zuolin, armed to resist the National Revolutionary Army, and strengthened his brutal rule over the people of Inner Mongolia, thus rising to become a prince. After the September 18th Incident, he colluded with the Japanese bandit Matsui, convened a representative meeting of feudal chieftains of the Jerim League, formulated evil regulations to trample on the Mongolian people, and held various meetings with the Japanese Kwantung Army authorities to sell out national interests. Consequently, he was appointed as the Director of Civil Affairs of the Xing'an General Office and the Governor of Xing'an South Province, leading the Japanese bandits to attack the Anti-Japanese United Army and slaughter Mongolian revolutionary youth in a bloody manner.

After August 15th, he colluded again with the "Restoration Army" to resist the democratic regime, colluded with the "Central" bandit Lu Bohang to rob herdsmen of their horses, and hid seventeen "Restoration Army" soldiers in Harzhalajia, plotting wrongdoing. Later, due to the vigorous development of the Inner Mongolia national autonomous movement, he was unable to realize his reactionary conspiracy, so he used double-dealing tactics to deceive the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government into appointing him as a third-class counselor, attempting to cover up his reactionary face as a Mongolian traitor and tyrant and continue to carry out sabotage activities. This time, he was exposed by the masses and given the punishment he deserved, which is truly an unprecedented victory in the three-month liberation struggle of the Mongolian people of the West Khoshuu Banner.

　　内蒙翻身人民法庭处决大蒙奸寿明阿
    【新华社东北五日电】内蒙古西科后旗翻身人民成立人民法庭，审讯大蒙奸寿明阿、专署旗长巴音那木尔及封建恶霸地主清乌苏克图。经六天审讯，在二百七十余群众诉苦和全旗人民代表议决后，由人民法庭判决罪大恶极的寿明阿以极刑。寿明阿在清末民初先后和窃国大盗袁世凯及反动军阀张作霖勾结，武装反抗国民革命军，加强其对内蒙人民的残酷统治，因而一跃为王爷。九一八后与日寇松井勾结，召集哲里木盟封建头子代表会，制定蹂躏蒙古人民的罪恶法规，并与日寇关东军当局举行出卖民族利益的各种会议，于是被任为兴安总督民政处长及兴安南省省长，率领日寇袭击抗日联军，血腥屠杀蒙古革命青年。八一五后复勾结“光复军”对抗民主政权，与“中央”胡子卢伯航串连抢劫牧民马群，并隐藏十七个“光复军”在哈尔扎拉嘉，图谋不轨。其后由于内蒙民族自治运动蓬勃开展，无法实现其反动阴谋，乃以两面派手段骗取内蒙自治政府三等参事，企图掩盖其蒙奸恶霸的反动面目，继续进行破坏活动。此次经群众揭发予以应得惩处，实为西科后旗蒙古人民三月来翻身斗争之空前胜利。
