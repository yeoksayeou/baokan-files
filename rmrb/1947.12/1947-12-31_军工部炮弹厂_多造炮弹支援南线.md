Military Industry Department Ammunition Factory
　　Produce More Ammunition to Support the Southern Front
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 29th dispatch] After the nationwide large-scale counter-offensive, a certain ammunition factory of the Military Industry Department launched an enthusiastic production campaign to support the southern front and strive for the title of "Liu Bocheng Factory." The production quantity this winter has increased by more than two and a half times compared to the first half of the year. The original daily work schedule was ten hours, but the workers voluntarily requested to increase it by two hours, and many people did not rest on Sundays. They shouted the fighting slogans of "continuous operation of machines without rest for workers" and "as long as the water turbine doesn't stop, we guarantee 100% completion of the task." In January of this year, each person only drilled × ammunition shells per day, increasing by one and a half times in June, and more than two times in July. Guo Bangcheng and Liu Fanyu, both 19-year-old young workers, made ×× fuse bodies per day in March, but increased by two and a half times in August and September. He Xile increased the number of shell boxes made from ×× to ××. Due to the increase in workers' production enthusiasm, many new inventions and creations emerged, achieving raw material savings, increased output, and improved quality. For example, Zhang Shangwu made tool holders, increasing from one tool to six, and completed the copper plating of steel springs created by Bu Songguang, making the shells moisture-proof and, according to feedback from the front lines, achieving 100% hit rate without duds. Wang Qingming used templates to make ammunition boxes, improving efficiency by two and a half times. Deputy Manager Ma created ×× drilling machines, increasing the number of ammunition shells drilled per day from ×× to ××. Yang Zhengang refined ×× catties of already spoiled yellow explosives into good explosives, and Zhang Zhanwu used red soil from the mountains instead of ginger yellow for oil wood boxes, saving money and improving appearance. Sand-turning workers used waste charcoal to make mud molds. In the past, the Machine Industry Department used a piece of soap to drill an ammunition shell hole, but now they all use cold water. They also demonstrated the great spirit of the proletariat in supporting the front lines, with the entire factory saving 3.9 million yuan for front-line support donations, as well as two silver bowls and three gold rings. Worker Xu Wenqing, starting from September, in addition to contributing 5,000 yuan per month to support the front lines, also voluntarily increased his working hours by two hours, promoting voluntary labor among all workers in the factory.

  　多造炮弹支援南线
    【本报太行二十九日电】军工部某炮弹厂，在全国大举反攻后，全厂掀起支援南线、争取刘伯承工厂的热烈生产运动。今冬生产数量较前半年增加二倍半强。每日原规定十小时工作，但工人自动要求增加两小时，很多人礼拜日也不休息。他们喊出歇人不歇机器的“连轴转”、“只要水轮不停，保证百分之百完全任务”的奋斗口号。今年一月份，每天每人只钻×个炮弹，六月增加一倍半，七月则增加二倍以上。郭邦成、刘凡遇都是十九岁的青年工人，做引信体三月时每天××个，八、九月则增加两倍半。何西乐打箱壳由××个增到××个。由于工人生产情绪增高，出现了许多新的发明和创造，做到了原料节省，产量增加，质量提高。如张尚武做刀杆工具，由一把刀增到六把，完成部宋光合创造钢簧镀铜，使炮弹不受潮，根据前方反映，做到百发百中不瞎火。王清明做炮弹箱用样板，提高了二倍半。马副经理创造了打眼机××部，使每天只钻××个炮弹增加为××个。杨振纲将已坏的黄色炸药××斤精制成好炸药，张占武油木箱过去用姜黄，现在改用山上红土，既省钱又好看。翻沙工人利用乏炭做泥型。机工部过去打一个炮弹眼，要用一块肥皂，现在全用凉水。他们在支援前线上，也表现了无产阶级的伟大精神，全厂节约支前献款三百九十万元，还有两个银碗，三个金戒指。工人许文清，从九月份起，除每月交五千元支援前线外，又自动增加工作时间二小时，推动了全厂工友献义务工。
