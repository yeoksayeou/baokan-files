Be Doctors for the Masses: Hebei-Shandong-Henan Joint Conference of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine

[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch on the 5th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office Health Bureau, in order to strengthen health work and ensure the health of the masses, specially convened a symposium on medicine and health. Representatives from various directly affiliated agencies and special commissioner's offices, as well as over seventy traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors from various counties, attended the meeting to discuss three issues: first, how to unify organizational leadership; second, the issue of unity between traditional Chinese and Western medicine; and third, how to further develop medical work and promote it to the vast rural areas. After discussion and research, it was decided that each special commissioner's office should establish a government-people's hospital, each county should establish a people's hospital, and each district should establish a medical cooperative. If objective conditions permit, maternity clinics should be attached, and health sub-bureaus should be established in each special commissioner's office, county, and district. The administrative leadership of the hospitals will belong to the governments at all levels, and the professional leadership will belong to the health bureau. Before the establishment of hospitals at all levels, a research association for traditional Chinese and Western medicine should be established first in order to quickly promote rural medical work. Regarding the issue of cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, initially, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners believed that Western medicine was unreliable, while Western medicine practitioners believed that traditional Chinese medicine was a relic of the past and did not understand pathology, thus leading to mutual distrust. After several days of deliberation and discussion, the report on the creation of cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine in Qingfeng County, as well as the professional experience reports of Dean Su and Dr. Feng of the Harrison Hospital (Western medicine), and Dr. Di Dagang (traditional Chinese medicine), enabled traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to put aside their prejudices and move towards cooperation in thought. In the discussion on how to further develop medical work in the entire area and promote medical work to the countryside, it was considered necessary to widely carry out publicity and education work to dispel the superstitious ideas of the masses. At the same time, traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners should earnestly be doctors for the people, clarify the concept of serving the people, not put on airs, and widely disseminate effective secret formulas to reduce the suffering of illness and mortality among the vast rural masses. The conference finally issued a letter to colleagues, loudly calling on traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to unite and be doctors for the masses.

　　要为群众当医生冀鲁豫中西医集会
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】冀鲁豫行署卫生局，为加强卫生工作，保证群众健康，特召开医药卫生座谈会。到会各直属机关、各专署代表，暨各县中西医生七十余人，共讨论三个问题：一是如何统一组织领导；二是中西医团结问题；三是如何更进一步发展医务工作，推行到广大农村。经过座谈研究，决议各专署成立政民医院，县成立人民医院，区成立医药合作社。如客观条件许可时，附设助产所，并于各专署县区建立卫生分局，医院行政领导属各级政府，业务领导属卫生局。在各级医院未建立前，先建立中西医务研究会，以便迅速推行农村医务工作。关于中西医合作问题，开始中医认为西医不可靠，西医则认为中医是时代残物，不懂病理，因此互不信任，经过数日的酝酿讨论，经清丰县创造中西医合作之汇报，及西医哈里逊医院苏院长、冯大夫、中医狄大光大夫等的业务经验报告，使中西医排除成见，在思想上趋于合作。在如何更进一步开展全区医务工作、把医务工作推向农村去的讨论中，认为需要广泛开展宣传教育工作，解除群众迷信思想，同时中西医要认真作人民的医生，明确为人民服的观点，不要拿架子，有效的秘方广泛传播，使广大农村群众减少疾病的痛苦和死亡率。大会最后发表告同业书，响亮号召中西医团结，要当群众的医生。
