Beiyuanzi Cooperative
　　Listens to the Opinions of Poor Women and Provides Concrete Assistance to Promote Textile Production
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 19th] The Beiyuanzi Village Cooperative in Qinyuan County is making every effort to promote textile production by addressing the daily life difficulties of employed poor women. At the beginning of this month, the village planned a "Ten Jin of Cotton" textile campaign. Fifty-eight households of employed poor women without livestock reflected, "We are willing to organize, but because we don't have livestock, grinding grain takes up most of our time, and we really can't sit at the spinning wheel." For example, the Guo Fuguan family, with four members, eats an average of four sheng of corn per day. The mother and wife together grind grain all day and can only grind two dou at most, which is only enough for five days. To eat for a month, the two of them would have to spend six days grinding grain, costing twelve workdays. If these twelve workdays were used to spin cotton, they could spin at least three jin. In addition, families like Jia Yindan's have large populations and must spend half a month grinding grain each month. This is calculated under general conditions. According to the women in the village, out of more than 600 people in the village, there are only eighteen grinding stones. Everyone is grinding, so they can't take care of each other, and they often miss two people, grinding only two or three sheng of grain a day. The cooperative accepted the opinions of the employed poor women and installed a miscellaneous grain mill, assigning a head of livestock and one person. It can grind one shi and two dou of corn per day, producing 144 jin of flour. After deducting 12 jin for the livestock and the person's expenses, the remaining 132 jin can supply the food needs of 132 people per day. People can exchange one dou of corn for eleven jin of flour at the cooperative. The 132 jin of flour would require 25 workdays if ground by people. Excluding the cooperative's head of livestock and one person, 21 workdays can be saved each day. If calculated based on hand-spinning, ten jin of cotton can be spun, thus perfectly solving the difficulty of lacking animal power, and women can fully engage in textile production.
　　[Our Newspaper Shexian News] In Shangwen Village, Second District, despite repeated calls from higher authorities to develop textile production, it has never been fully promoted. A few women who know how to weave are from Linxian and Wu'an. Only a few local women know how to weave, and they don't weave well. The cost of buying cloth each year is enormous. In order to solve this difficulty, after research by the cadres, a textile training class was opened. Technical workers were invited, loans were taken out from the bank, and the cooperative provided spinning wheels and looms. A batch of cotton was also purchased on credit. After preparing everything, the cadres went to each street to mobilize students, mainly employed poor people, totaling nine people (seven employed poor and two middle peasants), to learn the techniques. They have been studying for three weeks, and the technical workers cooperative supplies three and a half jin of rice per day. The students are very enthusiastic about learning.

　　北园子合作社
  　倾听贫苦妇女意见具体帮助推动纺织
    【本报太岳十九日电】沁源北园子村合作社，排除雇贫妇女日常生活困难，全力进行纺织。该村在本月初，酝酿进行纺织十斤花运动，五十八户无牲口的雇贫妇女反映：“组织倒是愿意，因为没有牲口，光磨面就把大部时间占去，实在坐不到车怀里。”如雇贫郭富官家四口人，每天平均吃四升玉茭，他娘和老婆两人整磨一天，顶多能磨二斗，只够吃五天，吃一个月就得两个人六天磨面，费工十二个。如抽出这十二个工纺花，最少也纺三斤。此外，贾银蛋等家人口多，每月便须半月时间磨面，这是按一般的条件下计算的。据该村妇女反映，全村六百余口人，只有十八盘碾，大家都碾就顾不过来，经常误上两个人，一天碾二三升面。合作社接受了雇贫妇女的意见，安起一盘杂粮磨，抽出一头牲口、一个人，每天可磨玉茭一石二斗，出面一百四十四斤，除牲口和人的十二斤开支外，余下一百三十二斤，每天即可供给一百三十二个人的吃用，群众拿一斗玉茭可到合作社换十一斤面，一百三十二斤面要按人碾就得廿五个工，除合作社的一头牲口、一个人外，每天即可节省二十一个工。如以行手纺花计算就可纺十斤花，这样便完满的解决了无畜力的困难，妇女可以全力进行纺织。
    【本报涉县讯】二区上温村，在过去上级再三号召开展纺织，始终没有全面的推动起来，有少数会纺织的妇女，也是从林县、武安来的，本地妇女只有很少会纺，也纺不好，每年买布耗费巨大，为了解决这一困难，经干部研究，开一纺织训练班，请技术工人，到银行贷款，合作社给制造纺车织布机，并给贷买了一部花，准备齐全干部分头到各街去动员学员，以雇贫为主共动员九人（七个雇贫二个中农），学习技术。现已学习三个星期，技术工人合作社每天供给三斤半米，学员学习情绪很高。　　　　　　　　（二区通讯组）
