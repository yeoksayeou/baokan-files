Puyang 4th and 6th Districts New Soldiers Return Gifts
    Refusing Village Cadres' Extravagance
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu 7th dispatch] In Puyang County's 4th and 6th districts, some village cadres did not adequately understand the significance of joining the army, and donated large sums of money to treat the new soldiers to lavish meals and drinks. For example, after the new soldiers from Nanlishang Village in the 6th district registered in the district and returned home, the village cadres, under the guise of sending off the new soldiers, solicited donations of one million yuan from the masses. Zhanghaizhuang donated 300,000 yuan. Sijiahu Village also donated more than 200,000 yuan. That village had thirteen new recruits, averaging 20,000 yuan per person. The new soldiers said, "We are joining the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek and eliminate harm for everyone. It's better to take care of us later than for everyone to spend so much money!" Many people agreed to donate on the surface, but were actually dissatisfied internally. The money was repeatedly returned by the new soldiers. When the new soldiers of Maxinzhuang were about to depart, they proposed three "don'ts": don't have a farewell feast, don't provide travel expenses, and don't provide shoes, socks, towels, or anything else, winning praise from the masses. The new soldiers in the 4th district refused wasteful farewells, while the masses took practical actions to solve the difficulties of military families. The new soldiers were at ease and the families were satisfied. Each village organized a comfort delegation to fetch water and grind flour for military families, solving specific difficulties. After the new soldiers of Houwangling left, the women's association made shoes and socks for military families who did not have them. Before the new soldiers of Hucun left, the masses helped the military families repair their houses, which made the new soldiers extremely happy.

　　濮阳四、六区新战士退回礼物
    拒绝村干铺张浪费
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】濮阳县四、六区在参军运动中，某些村干对参军认识不够，大量捐款请新战士大吃大喝。如六区南李上村新战士，在区里报名回家后，村干就以欢送新战士为名，向群众捐款百万元。张海庄捐三十万元。四甲户村亦捐二十多万元，该村参军十三人，平均每人合两万元。新战士说：“俺参军为打老蒋，为大家除害，大家花这样多钱，还不如以后照顾好呢！”许多群众表面上对于捐款同意，其实内心亦不满。该款经新战士再三退回。马辛庄新战士临别时，提出三不要：一不要会餐，二不要路费，三不要鞋袜手巾等一切东西，博得群众赞扬。四区新战士拒绝浪费欢送，群众则以实际行动解决军属困难，新战士安心，家属满意，各村组织慰问团，给军属打水推磨，解决具体困难，后王岭新战士走后，妇会给没有鞋袜穿的军属做鞋袜。胡村新战士未走前，群众先就帮助军属修补房屋，新战士极欢喜。
