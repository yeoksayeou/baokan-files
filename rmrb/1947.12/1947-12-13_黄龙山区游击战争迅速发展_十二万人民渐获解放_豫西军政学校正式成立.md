    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: Guerrilla warfare is rapidly developing in the Huanglong Mountain area, a famous military stronghold in eastern Shaanxi. The vast countryside is now controlled by the guerrillas, and 120,000 people in the area, who were oppressed by the Chiang bandits, have begun to be liberated. The enemy's rural Bao-Jia system has been destroyed, and a democratic government has been established. In areas where guerrillas are active, the masses have risen up to resist conscription and grain requisition, and have volunteered to lead the guerrillas, scout, block news, and rescue the wounded. A large number of peasants have poured into the guerrilla forces to fight against the Chiang bandits. A certain guerrilla unit developed five or six times in mid-October. In the Battle of Hancheng, the local guerrillas and the masses actively supported and cooperated with the main force in the battle, mobilizing 500 carts and hundreds of stretchers in a few days. On October 7th, the 53rd Brigade of Hu bandit's 90th Division went south to "suppress" [the guerrillas], and was attacked by our guerrillas while crossing the Luo River, killing and wounding more than 30 enemies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 11th: The Yuxi Military and Political School in the newly established Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei New District has been formally established. General Li Jingyi, commander of a certain military sub-district, is concurrently serving as the principal. There are now more than 300 students in the school. A large number of educated youths from the banks of the Luo and Yi Rivers have rushed to study at the school, and have accused the Chiang bandits of their deception and persecution at denunciation meetings. Ninety young soldiers of the Chiang army, who were liberated by us in October, have also resumed their studies, which were taken away by the Chiang bandits a year ago, and are studying freely and happily at the school.

    【新华社西北十一日电】陕西东部著名军事要地黄龙山区游击战争正迅速发展，广大乡村已为游击队所控制，被蒋匪压榨下之该地十二万人民，已开始获得解放。摧毁了敌人乡保统治，建立了民主政权。游击队活跃地区，群众纷起抗丁抗粮，并自动为游击队带路侦察，封锁消息，救护伤员，大批农民则涌入游击队与蒋匪作战。某游击队于十月中旬即发展五、六倍，在韩城战斗中，当地游击队和群众积极支援与配合主力作战，数日内即动员大车五百辆，担架数百付。十月七日胡匪九十师五十三旅南下“清剿”，正过洛河时，即曾遭我游击队袭击，毙伤敌三十余名。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十一日电】豫陕鄂新区豫西军政学校已正式建立，某分区司令员李静宜将军兼任校长。现到校学员三百余人，洛、伊沿岸大批知识青年赶来就学，并在诉苦会上，控诉蒋匪对他们的欺骗与迫害。十月间被我解放的九十个蒋军青年军士兵，亦恢复了他们一年前被蒋匪剥夺了的学习生活，来校作自由愉快的学习。
