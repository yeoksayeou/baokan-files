　　Jinnan Continues to Liberate Anyi
　　Frontline Commander Commends Yuncheng Assault Troops
　　[This newspaper's Jinnan Front, 29th dispatch] Under the mighty force of our army's capture of Yuncheng, Zhang Yuxiang, head of the Anyi Yan bandit "Love the Homeland Corps," abandoned the city and fled on the evening of the 28th. More than 100 were captured alive by our blocking troops in the suburbs, and the remaining enemies are being encircled and annihilated by our army. Anyi County was immediately liberated by us.
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue, 29th dispatch] Our Jinnan Front troops captured Yuncheng, and the Taiyue District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region sent a special telegram of congratulations. The original telegram reads as follows: "Commander Wang and all commanders and fighters of the Yuncheng assault troops, we are delighted to hear that you have captured Yuncheng and annihilated all the defending enemies. The soldiers and civilians of the entire district are jubilant and inspired, celebrating this great victory and praising the bravery and tenacity of our army. We hereby send a telegram of congratulations."
　　[Jinnan Front, 28th dispatch] The Commander of the Jinnan People's Liberation Army issued a commendation order to the heroic commanders and fighters who cleared the obstacles to the city during the Yuncheng outer defense battle. The original text is as follows:
　　The so-called modern permanent fortifications of the enemy strongholds and Jiang bandits in the outer defenses of Yuncheng were quickly transformed into our support for attacking the city under your fierce artillery fire, forced blasting, and heroic attack. The defenders ultimately could not escape the fate of being burned to death or buried alive. You have made the first great contribution in the struggle to clear the obstacles to the city, especially in the battle to attack the Group Dugout No. 16 and the northeast bunker of the Memorial Pagoda at Majiayao. Our artillery gunners, machine gunners, and infantry assault troops demonstrated swift and courageous actions, commanders commanded effectively, and the coordination between infantry, engineers, and artillery was skillful. We hope to continue to promote this spirit, and a commendation order is hereby issued, and the entire army is called upon to learn from it.
　　[This newspaper's Jinnan Front, 25th dispatch] Before the battle to liberate Yuncheng, our heroic soldiers wrote letters of request to their superiors, resolutely requesting to undertake the most arduous tasks in the city attack. The letters of request from each company, platoon, and squad all unanimously stated: "We resolutely request to undertake the most arduous tasks in the city attack, spare no sacrifice, and be sure to complete the task." All the commanders and fighters of a certain company bit their fingers and wrote a blood letter, expressing their determination. The Second and Sixth Companies said in their blood-written request: "We will not only build ladders, but also participate in the commando, until the enemy is eliminated. We voluntarily set a discipline, continue to fight with minor injuries, only advance, no retreat!" After holding a separate determination meeting, the new soldiers of the Fourth Regiment wrote a letter to their superiors saying: "Wherever the squad leader goes, we will follow, and we will not eat the people's white flour until Yuncheng is taken!" The soldier Wu Ersheng said: "If the water in the outer moat is one person deep, I will swim across the city first." The Fourth Brigade specially convened a meeting of company-level cadres to brainstorm ideas, and came up with five new methods of scaling the city. The enthusiasm of our heroic soldiers to scale the city reached a climax, creating a new record since the beginning of the war.

　　晋南继续解放安邑
  　前线司令员嘉奖运城攻坚部队
    【本报晋南前线二十九日电】在我大军攻克运城神威震慑下，安邑阎匪“爱乡团”张毓相于二十八日晚率部弃城逃跑，于城郊被我阻击部队生俘一百多人，残敌正被我军围歼中。安邑县城当即为我解放。
    【本报太岳二十九日电】我晋南前线部队攻克运城，太岳区党委、行署、军区特驰电祝贺。原电如下：“王司令员并转全体攻运部队指战员同志，欣闻攻占运城全歼守敌，全区军民无不欢腾鼓舞，共庆此一伟大胜利，同声赞佩我军之英勇顽强，特电祝贺。”
    【晋南前线二十八日电】晋南人民解放军司令员通令嘉奖运城外围战役中，扫清登城障碍的英勇指战员，其原文如下：
    运城外围敌据点蒋匪的所谓现代化永久性筑城，在你们的猛烈炮火强行爆破与英勇的进攻下，迅速变成了我们攻城的依托，守敌终未逃脱被烧死被活埋的命运，你们在扫清登城障碍斗争中首建奇功，特别在攻打马家窑的集团伏地碉十六号碉及纪念塔东北方碉战斗中，我炮兵射击手、机枪射击手、步兵突击手表现了动作勇猛神速，指挥员指挥有方，步、工、炮协同巧妙，这种精神望继续发扬，特通令嘉奖，并号召全军学习。
    【本报晋南前线二十五日电】解放运城战斗前，我英勇战士纷纷向上级写请求书，坚决要求在攻城中担任最艰苦的任务。各连排班的请求书上，都一致写着：“坚决要求担负攻城中最艰苦的任务，不惜任何牺牲，一定要完成任务。”某连全体指战员咬破手指，写成血书，表示决心。二连、六连在血写的请求书上说：“我们不仅要架梯子，还要参加突击队，直到消灭敌人为止。我们自愿订下纪律，轻伤继续战斗，只有前进，没有后退！”四团新战士单独开了决心会后，给首长写信说：“班长走到那里，我们跟到那里，拿不下运城不吃老百姓的白面！”战士武二生说：“如果外壕的水有一人深，我先游过上城。”四大队专门召集连级干部开想办法会议，研究出五种新的登城办法，我英勇战士的登城情绪达到高潮，创造作战以来的新纪录。
