Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 14th: Moscow Broadcasting: Commentator Masinu published a commentary comparing the rural economies of the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the Liberated Areas, stating: On November 26th, the price of rice in Guangzhou rose to 1.15 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). On the same day, the Kuomintang authorities were busy holding meetings in Shanghai to discuss stabilizing prices, while the Kuomintang's "Shen Bao" newspaper reported on the starvation deaths of many people in the Kuomintang areas. However, on the same day, the Northern Shaanxi Radio Station was broadcasting news of the abundant autumn harvest and falling food prices in the Liberated Areas.

The reason for such a huge difference between these two regions in China is that they are implementing two opposing policies. In the Liberated Areas, because feudalism and colonial oppression have been eliminated, a truly democratic and patriotic government has been established, and extensive democratic reforms have been implemented, first and foremost the implementation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "land to the tiller," they have no food crisis and are able to overcome natural disasters. As reported by the Northern Shaanxi Radio Station on the same day, in the liberated southern Shanxi, due to the fundamental changes in the lives of the peasants, an astonishing fact is evident: the peasants here, who had just suffered a drought this summer, reaped an abundant harvest this autumn, enough for them to use for a year or two. For example, in Yuanxing Village, Yangcheng County, the entire village's total income for ten months this year was 8,990 shi of grain, with an average of 5 shi and 7 dou and 8 sheng (units of dry measure) per person, young and old. Among them, a mutual aid group of peasants and farmhands who had overturned their lives earned an average of 13 shi and 4 dou per person. The main reason is that the peasants have become the masters of the land. One peasant happily said, "For three generations, my family has worked for the landlords, and now we are starting to harvest our own food on our own land."

In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, however, the opposite is true. Not only has land not been distributed to the peasants, but the four major families are carrying out a policy of plundering the peasants' land. They use various methods, such as taking advantage of the peasants' inability to pay high rents or debts, and even more so by using the methods of civil war to seize the peasants' land. They organize so-called "agricultural companies," such as the Chen brothers' "Huaxi Reclamation Company," which has seized 100,000 mu (unit of area) of land near the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway alone, and has seized vast tracts of land in Zhejiang, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other regions. Chiang Ching-kuo's "New Southern Jiangxi National Economic Construction Company" also aims to occupy large areas of private land. These situations can be seen in other provinces ruled by the Kuomintang. In addition, due to the doubled expansion of the Kuomintang army, police, military police, and bureaucratic organs, they forcibly requisition more grain from the peasants who have not yet been driven away, thus causing a rapid decline in the level of agricultural products in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. A series of developments, such as the deepening food crisis and the destruction of the agricultural base, are also the main reasons for the continuous rise in prices and the intensification of hunger and suffering in the region.

The Kuomintang reactionaries have recently been shouting about so-called American "aid," attempting to prove that American help can save the Chinese people from starvation. However, this is not the first time that American grain has been shipped to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, yet hunger continues to grow. This food relief can at most feed the Kuomintang's hungry army for a short period of time, but it cannot solve the fundamental problem and will certainly not be used to feed millions of hungry people. The Kuomintang's clamoring is merely to cover up its behavior of selling out its own people and betraying national interests, so that the people will not pay attention to the fundamental causes of the food crisis and economic collapse.

The Chinese people have long known that the current civil war is the Kuomintang's attack on the Chinese people. A few days ago, the Chinese people heard about the purpose of this war. The bulletin issued by Chiang Kai-shek's Peiping (Beijing) Pacification Headquarters on November 30th, published in the Chinese newspapers, stipulated that "farmland in the recovered areas (referring to the Chiang-occupied areas) will be returned to owner-cultivators, and non-owner-cultivated land will also be returned to landlords." This nakedly exposes the main purpose of the Kuomintang's civil war, which is to seize the land that the Chinese peasants have acquired under the leadership of the Communist Party in implementing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "land to the tiller," so that these lands can completely become the private property of the Kuomintang landlords.

### 马西努评中国两种世道：  共产党领导农民翻身  蒋匪帮掠夺土地自肥

    马西努评中国两种世道：
    共产党领导农民翻身
    蒋匪帮掠夺土地自肥
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科广播：评论员马西努以蒋管区与解放区农村经济对照发表评论称：十一月二十六日广州大米价格每石涨到一百一十五万元，这一天国民党当局正在上海忙着召集会议讨论平抑物价，国民党的“申报”则报导着国民党区许多人饿死的事实。然而，在同一天陕北广播电台却正广播着解放区的丰富秋收和食粮价格下降的消息。
    在中国这两个区域所以有着这样巨大的区别，正是因为这两个区域正实行着两种相反的政策。在解放区内，由于铲除了封建制度与殖民地的压迫，建立了真正的民主爱国政权，实行了广泛的民主改革，首先是实行了孙中山先生的耕者有其田的原则，因此他们就没有粮食危机，并能克服自然所给予的灾荒。如陕北广播电台当天所报导的，在解放了的晋南，由于农民生活已根本改变，表现出使人惊异的事实：这里的农民，今年夏天刚遭受旱灾，在今年秋收中却得到了丰富的收获，足够他们一年或两年之用。例如阳城县属的元兴村，今年十个月全村共收入了八千九百九十石粮食，全村大小人口平均每人可得五石七斗八升；其中从贫雇翻身的一个互助组平均每人收入达十三石四斗。其主要原因，就是农民已成了土地的主人。一个农民高兴的说：“我家三辈子都是给地主做活，现在开始在自己的土地上收获着自己的食粮了”。
    在国民党统治区却正相反，在那里不仅没有分给农民土地，四大家族还正进行着掠夺农民土地的政策。他们用各种方法，如利用农民不能支付高额的地租或欠款等，更爱利用内战方法去夺取农民的土地。他们组织有所谓“农业公司”，如陈家兄弟之“华西垦殖公司”，仅在云南滇越铁路附近，就圈占了十万亩土地，并在浙江、广西、江西及其他地区霸占广大土地。蒋介石的儿子蒋经国所经营的“新赣南国民经济建设公司”，也是以占有广大面积之私有土地为目的的。这些情形，在其他国民党统治的省份中，都可以看到。此外，由于国民党军队、警察、宪兵和官僚机关的加倍扩大，又向尚未被赶走的农民强征更多的粮食，因而便造成了国民党统治区农产品水准急速下降。粮食危机加深、农业基础被破坏等一连串的发展，也是该区域内物价不断高涨及加强着饥饿与痛苦的主要原因。
    国民党反动派最近又高喊所谓美国的“援助”，企图证明美国的帮助可以把中国人由饥饿中救出来，然而美国的粮食已不是第一次运往国民党统治区，饥饿却仍不断增长着。这次的粮食救济，最多只能在短时期喂一喂国民党的饥饿军队，而不能解决基本问题，决不是用来供养几百万饥饿的人民。上述国民党的叫嚣，只是为了掩护其出卖本国人民与出卖民族利益的行为，使人民不去注意粮食危机和经济崩溃的基本原因。
    中国人民早已知道，现在的内战就是国民党向中国人民的进攻。前几天中国人民又听到关于这个战争目的之言论，十一月三十日中国报纸上所发表的蒋介石北平行辕的布告中规定“收复区（指蒋占区）农地是自耕农的发还，非自耕地亦发还地主。”这赤裸裸的暴露了国民党进行内战的主要目的，就是要夺取中国农民由于共产党领导实行孙中山先生耕者有其田的原则，而分得的土地，使这些土地完全成为国民党大地主的私有财产。
