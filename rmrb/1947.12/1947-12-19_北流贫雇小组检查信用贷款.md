    Beiliu Poor and Hired Peasant Group Inspects Credit Loans
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Licheng] In the first month of the lunar year, the Beiliu Cooperative used bank loans and the fruits of the struggle of the liberated masses to establish a credit department. In the first half of the year, the significant effect of the credit loans was that the entire village added more than ten head of livestock. The credit department thought this was very good, but the poor peasants felt they had suffered losses. Now, at a time when poor peasants urgently need loans for winter production, the credit department had no money to lend, which made the poor and hired peasant group demand an immediate inspection. The results of the inspection were: (1) From the perspective of funds, in addition to bank loans, the shares of the poor and hired peasants were the largest, accounting for 51.2%, middle peasants accounted for 36.42%, rich peasants accounted for 11.75%, and landlords accounted for 0.58%. (2) From the perspective of current deposits, the poor and hired peasants also had the most. The deposits of 13 poor and hired peasant households, plus the fruits deposited by the Turn-Over Association, accounted for 45.68% of the total deposits. (3) From the perspective of the amount and effect of the loans, the poor and hired peasants suffered the most. Twenty-three poor and hired peasant households borrowed a total of 461,500 yuan, accounting for 32.8% of the loans to all classes, and only bought two donkeys and a little more than half a mule. Seventeen old middle peasant households borrowed a total of 661,400 yuan, accounting for 47.01%, and bought seven and a half donkeys and more than three mules. Nine rich peasant households also borrowed 283,970 yuan, accounting for 20.19%, and also bought three mules and one and a half donkeys. In addition, 250,000 yuan was lent to the flour mill, and 130,000 yuan is still owed, but the flour mill is controlled by landlords and rich peasants. Obviously, the above statistics prove that the credit department exploited the poor and hired peasants (bank loans should also be lent to the poor and hired peasants) and served the landlords and rich peasants. The fundamental reason for this error is that it only asked whether the purpose was correct, and did not think about whether the peasants were poor or hired. After the inspection, the thinking of the poor and hired peasants who were in charge became clearer, and they realized that they themselves had to be in charge of the loans. Therefore, after repeated discussions by the poor and hired peasant group, the wrongly lent funds were recovered, together with 655,000 yuan misappropriated by the cooperative from various loans. Based on family circumstances and the principle of voluntariness, all the funds were lent to 74 poor and hired peasant households, solving the difficulty of the poor and hired peasants lacking funds, and the enthusiasm for winter production immediately increased. Hu Yu said: "With capital, there is no problem, we can start working!" Old man He Yi said: "I am 63 years old, I will follow you young people, and go wherever you say!" In addition to organizing mills, setting up small stalls, and investing in sugar mills, five poor and hired peasant transport teams were specially organized to launch a winter production campaign.

    北流贫雇小组检查信用贷款
    【本报黎城讯】正月间北流合作社使用银行贷款和翻身群众入的斗争果实成立了信用部，前半年信用贷款的显著作用是使全村增添了十多头牲口，信用部就以为满好，但贫苦农民都觉得吃了亏。又当此贫苦农民急需贷款进行冬季生产之际，信用部反没钱贷给，这就使得贫雇小组要求立刻予以检查。经检查的结果：（一）从资金上看，除银行贷款外，贫雇入的股顶多，占百分之五十一点二，中农占百分之三十六点四二，富农占百分之十一点七五，地主占百分之点五八。（二）从活期存款上看，也是贫雇最多，十三户贫雇的存款加上翻身会存的果实就占到存款总数的百分之四十五点六八。（三）从贷款的数目和效果上看，却是贫雇农最吃亏。二十三户贫雇共贷四十六万一千五百元，占各阶层贷款数的百分之三十二点八，仅仅买得两头毛驴和多半头骡子。十七户老中农共贷六十六万一千四百元，占百分之四十七点零一，增买了七头半驴，三头多骡子。九户富农还贷了二十八万三千九百七十元，占百分之二十点一九，也增买三头骡子和一头半驴。此外，还曾贷给粉坊二十五万元，至今尚欠十三万元没归还，但粉坊都为地主富农所把持。显然，以上统计数字证明信用部是剥削了贫雇（银行贷款也应该贷给贫雇），而为地主富农服了务。其造成这种错误的基本原因，由于只问用途正确不正确，根本没有想到贫雇不贫雇。经过检查，贫雇当家的思想更加亮了，认识到在贷款上也非贫雇自己当家不可，于是经过贫雇小组的再三讨论，收回贷错了的款子，连同合作社挪用各种贷款共六十五万五千元，根据家境情况与自愿原则，全数贷给了七十四户贫雇，解决了贫雇缺乏资金的困难，冬季生产情绪立即提高。虎玉说：“有了本钱，就不成问题，就能干开！”合义老汉说：“我六十三啦，跟上你们年青人，说去那儿就去那儿！”除了组织磨坊、摆小摊、投资糖坊等，特别组织起五个贫雇运输小组，展开了冬季生产运动。
