Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st: A correspondent from this agency commented on the unprecedented large-scale winter training movement in the rear of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, stating: This movement has the following three characteristics: First, each corps has sufficient personnel, the vast majority of whom are peasants who have achieved liberation with class consciousness. Before enlisting, they first underwent the "three no's" (i.e., "those who are not voluntary are not accepted, those with unclear backgrounds are not accepted, and those who are not qualified in age and unhealthy are not accepted") before being allowed to enter the army. Many corps also conducted mass movements to speak out about grievances and kill the enemy at this time, raising questions such as "Why enlist?", "Why fight?", and "Why train?" and engaging in heated discussions before throwing themselves into a feverish training rush. Therefore, they are very clear about the purpose of training and killing the enemy, and they have expressed that "whoever can bravely kill the enemy in the future depends on who can work hard to train today." Since the beginning of the movement, except for a few landlords and rich peasants' children who took the opportunity to sneak in and have been purged, there have never been any cases of desertion. Second, because the composition of the troops is pure and they have a high degree of consciousness, they are easy to manage and educate, and progress is rapid. In a short period of time, soldiers in several corps have mastered various basic skills. Some troops have discovered a large number of sharpshooters and received "bullseye" prize banners. When some new recruits began practicing throwing grenades, they could only throw them about ten meters; but after five days of hard training, they could throw them more than forty meters. Therefore, the coaching policy of each unit, which focuses on technology and supplements it with tactics, and combines the two, has been successfully implemented. The current requirements are that every soldier must be accurate in shooting, throw grenades far and accurately, and be powerful, agile, and persistent in bayonet fighting. Third, cadres at all levels in each corps have become more mass-oriented in their thinking and style of work in this brand-new revolutionary team. Many soldiers dare to boldly criticize certain cadres' bureaucratic style and the shortcomings of coaching that cannot meet everyone's requirements, forcing cadres at all levels to look downward and follow the mass line. At present, each corps is launching a "three check-ups" movement to check thinking, check style of work, and check class background, in order to create a heatwave where everyone contributes ideas, everyone thinks of solutions, and everyone helps and competes with each other, so that all technical and tactical coaching methods can achieve better consistent effects, and the integration of field training and battlefield experience can be closely combined. The above three characteristics indicate that this powerful reserve army is about to become a people's army that combines "bravery plus technology and tactics." Once this army is put into the counter-offensive front line, it will become a great force that is invincible and indestructible.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st: After checking their composition, ideology, and physical condition, the soldiers' corps of various military regions of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army have launched a widespread training upsurge. Tens of thousands of young and strong liberated soldiers, under the slogan of "Study hard to acquire skills and eradicate the roots of all evils," practice shooting, throwing grenades, blasting, and bayonet fighting, four major skills, in the snow from dawn till dusk. In early November, the independent corps of Mudanjiang held a grand review. In the preliminary technical competition, 3,199 people were selected as preliminary top-notch shooters. Among the corps participating in the shooting competition, there were nine companies where the average hit rate of more than twenty squads increased from 99.2% to 100%. In grenade throwing, 748 people exceeded 45 meters. The average throwing distance of one company of a certain regiment reached 43.8 meters, and all participating units averaged around 38 meters. Soldier Jiao Xuewen threw a grenade 62 meters and received an award from the military region. In the forced march competition, the Second Training Team of a certain unit marched 5,000 meters in 25 minutes and 50 seconds, without a single straggler. 91.43% of one company of a certain regiment passed five obstacles over a distance of 100 meters, with an average time of only 17.5 seconds per person. The independent corps of Hegang started training in early October, adopting the working method of "attacking both ends" (activists and backward elements) and "eliminating dead corners" to continuously improve the training movement. Most commanders and fighters got up at almost three o'clock in the morning and automatically rushed to the snow to train hard. At night, electric lights were installed on the parade ground, where soldiers lifted stones to practice arm strength. A certain corps in Heilongjiang displayed a high degree of creativity in training and invented a sighting inspection mirror, which greatly improved shooting. A certain battalion held a shooting exercise, and no one missed the target. In the training of a certain unit in Nenjiang, the club divided soldiers into three groups, A, B, and C, according to their technical progress, and adopted the methods of mutual assistance and promotion and demotion. The club announced the results at any time to promote competition among the groups. Many units abolished Group C in a very short period of time. In the past twenty days, 444 shooters have emerged from a certain regiment in Songjiang. A commendation meeting was held a few days ago, and the Second Squad of the Eleventh Company won the "bullseye" prize banner. The military region also stipulated a reduction in the duties of new soldiers, so that they would have more time to practice. In training, each corps also paid great attention to cultural entertainment. Many scripts based on good and bad typical examples in training were performed in each unit. The training movement in other military regions of Jilin is also widely unfolding. Liaodong, Jicha-Rehe-Liaoning, and other places have also begun. The corps along the Beining Line in the Jidong area are also conducting training in conjunction with combat, repeatedly defeating the Chiang bandits.

　　展开空前规模冬季练兵运动
    东北建强大预备军
    成份都是翻身农民有高度阶级自觉性战士敢于批评干部部队作风更加改进
    【新华社东北一日电】分社记者评东北民主联军后方空前规模的冬季大练兵运动称：此一运动有着如下三个特点：第一，各兵团人员充足，绝大部分是有阶级觉悟的翻身农民。他们于入伍前，首先经过了“三不要”（即“不是自愿的不要，来历不明的不要，年龄不合格身体不健康不要”）后才得进入部队，不少兵团并在此时进行群众性的诉苦杀敌运动，提出“为何入伍？”“为何作战？”“为何练兵”等问题，展开热烈讨论，旋即投入苦练热潮。因此他们对练兵与杀敌的目的性非常明确，纷纷表示“将来谁能勇敢杀敌，就看今天谁能努力练兵。”自运动开始迄今，除乘机混入的若干地主富农子弟被清洗外，从未发生过逃亡现象。第二，由于部队成份纯洁，有高度的自觉性，故管教容易，进步迅速。若干兵团的战士，在短短的时间内，即熟习了各种基本技术，有的部队发现了大批神枪手，获得“百发百中”的奖旗，有些新战士开始练习投弹时，仅能投到十余米；但经过五天的苦练后，即达四十余米。因之各部队以技术为主战术为辅并使两者结合的教练方针，得以顺利贯彻。目前的要求是每个战士都要做到射击准确，投弹远准，刺杀有力、敏捷、持久。第三，各兵团的各级干部在此崭新的革命队伍中，思想作风更加群众化，很多战士都能大胆批评某些干部的官僚主义作风，与教练上不能满足大家要求的缺点，使各级干部不得不眼睛向下，走群众路线。目前各兵团正掀起查思想、查作风、查阶级的三查运动，以便造成人人出主意、大家想办法、互相帮助与互相比赛的热潮，使一切技术与战术的教练方法，获得更好的一致效用，使操场训练与战场经验密切的结合。上述三个特点，标帜着这支强大的预备军行将成为“勇敢加技术与战术结合”的人民队伍，这支队伍一旦投入反攻前线时，则将成为攻无不克、坚无不摧的伟大力量。
    【新华社东北一日电】东北民主联军各军区子弟兵团经过查成份、查思想、查身体后，掀起广泛的苦练热潮，成千成万的年青力壮翻身战士在“好好学本领，刨掉总坏根”的口号下，起早搭黑的在雪地中练习射击、投弹、爆炸、刺杀四大技术。牡丹江各独立兵团曾于十一月初举行一次大检阅，在技术预赛中被选为初步特等射手的有三千一百九十九人，参加射击比赛的兵团中共有九个连队，其中二十班以上平均命中率由百分之九十九点二达到百分之百。投弹方面超过四十五米的有七百四十八名，某团一连投弹平均数达四十三点八米，所有参加比赛的各单位均在三十八米左右。战士教学文投弹达六十二米，获得军区的奖励。急行军比赛中某部教二队以二十五分五十秒的时间行进五千米，无一人掉队。某团一连有百分之九十一点四三的人数通过百米距离的五道障碍时，每人平均仅需时十七秒半。合江各独立兵团于十月上旬开始练兵，采取“突击两头”（积极分子与落后分子）“消灭死角”的工作方式，使练兵运动步步提高。大部指战员差不多早晨三点钟就起床，自动奔往雪地苦练。晚上操场上并装着电灯，战士们都在那儿提举石头，练习臂力。黑龙江某兵团在练兵中发挥了高度的创造精神，发明一种瞄准检查镜，对射击起了很大的作用。某营曾举行一次打靶，全体无一人脱靶。嫩江某部在练兵中，由俱乐部按战士技术进度分为甲、乙、丙三组，采取互助及升降的办法，由俱乐部随时公布成绩，推动各组掀起竞赛，很多单位在极短时间内即废除了丙组。松江某团在过去廿几天中，已涌现了四百四十四名射击手，日前曾举行给奖大会，十一连二班获得“百发百中”的奖旗。该军区并规定减少新战士的勤务，使得更多时间练习。各兵团在练兵中对文化娱乐亦极注意，很多以练兵中之好坏典型事例为题材的剧本，在各部演出。其他吉林军区练兵运动正广泛展开，辽东、冀察热辽各地亦已开始，冀东地区沿北宁线各兵团并结合战斗进行练兵，迭创蒋匪。
