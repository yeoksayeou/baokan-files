    (Our newspaper, Taihang, 10th dispatch) During the battle to besiege the isolated city of Yuanshi, the Zanhuang stretcher team braved intense artillery fire to carry the wounded. On the night of November 22nd, our army fiercely attacked the western pass of Yuanshi. More than 100 stretchers from various districts of Zanhuang, totaling more than 500 people, bravely participated in the battle, rescuing the wounded. Hu Junhua, the stretcher squad leader (militiaman) of Puhong Village, personally led ten stretchers and automatically completed the task of rescuing the wounded on the front line; he alone carried three wounded soldiers on his back. Hu Junhua often told his team members: "The troops are sacrificing and bleeding to remove the Chiang Kai-shek's roots from our doorsteps so that we can live a peaceful life. What does it matter if we sweat a little!" Jiang Baiyan, the squad leader of the Gushan liberated stretcher team, kept putting his mattress on the wounded during the transfer from the front line to the rear, and kindly comforted the wounded saying, "It's cold, you were injured for us, you must put this thick mattress on, I will only feel relieved when you rest in peace."

    赞皇担架队在火线上
    奋不顾身抢救伤员
    【本报太行十日电】围攻元氏孤城战役中，赞皇担架队冒激烈炮火抢抬伤员。上月二十二日夜，我军猛攻元氏西关，赞皇各区一百余付担架，共五百余人，勇敢参战，抢救彩号。蒲宏村担架小队长（民兵）胡俊华，亲自带领十付担架，自动完成了最前线的抢救伤员任务；只他一人，就抢背下三个彩号。胡俊华经常和他的队员们说：“部队为刨掉咱家门边的蒋根，好让咱过安生光景，不怕牺牲流血，咱流两身汗算什么！”孤山翻身担架队班长姜白眼从火线上往后方转运伤员途中，一直把自己的褥子给伤员铺上，并亲切的安慰伤员说：“天气冷，你为俺们挂了彩，你得把这厚褥子铺上，安心休息我才放心。”
