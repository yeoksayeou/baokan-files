　　Qinyuan Fourth District Cooperative
  　Attaches Importance to Organizing Women's Textile Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] Cadre Cui Yongyan of Qinyuan Fourth District actively leads the masses in production, influencing the cooperatives in all 31 villages in the district to pay attention to organizing mass winter production. Comrade Cui Yongyan, upon arriving in the Fourth District this year, immediately learned that the biggest difficulty for the masses in the district was that they could only afford to eat, not to clothe themselves, and that the cooperatives had a simple profit-seeking perspective. He also investigated that the only one flying-shuttle loom and 36 small looms in the district were idle. Therefore, every time he went to a village, he used concrete accounting methods to organize the masses to spin and weave. He also discussed with district cadres about establishing a textile training center in Wujiagou, focusing on training women in weaving. Initially, due to financial difficulties, he mobilized women to go while personally working with comrades Pang Fuming of the District Joint Cooperative and Wei Dingguo, the Deputy District Head, to repair the house. After building one room, he personally went to Guzhen to borrow machines and went with Pang Fuming to the County Joint Cooperative to carry cotton. To avoid delaying the women's learning time, he personally carried firewood and ground flour, without any airs. Under his painstaking leadership, after two and a half months, the women finally learned. As a result, the cooperatives in all 31 villages in the district were influenced, and they all paid attention to organizing mass production. Among them, 25 village cooperatives lent 7,000 catties of cotton to the masses for spinning and weaving, and trained 437 flying-shuttle loom weavers, adding 65 new looms. Currently, Liujiagou, Wanghe, Jian'ya Di, and Shizhuang are four villages that are already self-sufficient in textiles, while Chishiqiao, Huihe, Yaobi, Shihuiwan, and Gengcun are five villages that are partially self-sufficient.

　　沁源四区合作社
  　注意组织妇女纺织
    【本报太岳二十一日电】沁源四区干部崔永言，积极领导群众生产，影响全区三十一村合作社注意组织群众冬季生产。崔永言同志今年一到四区，即了解到该区群众最大的困难是顾了吃顾不了穿，还有合作社的单纯营利观点，并调查全区仅有的一架拉梭机、三十六架小机都闲着。因此，他每到一村便用具体的算帐办法来组织群众纺织，并与区干部研究武家沟创办一个纺织传习所，着重培养织布妇女，开始因经费困难，他一面动员妇女前往，一面亲自与区联社庞福明、副区长卫定国等同志，动手修补房子，把一间房子盖起了后，他又亲自到固镇借机子，并和庞福明到县联社去担棉花，为了不耽误妇女的学习时间，他又亲自担柴、磨面，没有一点架子，在他的苦心领导下，经两个半月时间，妇女们终于学会了。因此，影响了全区三十一个村的合作社，都注意了组织群众生产，其中有二十五个村合作社，以七千斤棉花贷给群众纺织，并培养出拉梭机织妇四百三十七人，新增加织布机六十五架。现纺织已能自给的有刘家沟、王和、涧崖底、师庄四个村，半自给者有赤石桥、回和、姚壁、石灰湾、梗村五个村。
