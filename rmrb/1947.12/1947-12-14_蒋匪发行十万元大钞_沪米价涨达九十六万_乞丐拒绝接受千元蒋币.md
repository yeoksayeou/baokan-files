Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: According to reports from various sources, the Chiang bandit government officially announced on the 9th that it would begin issuing new customs gold unit notes with denominations of 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 yuan (equivalent to 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 Chiang currency) starting on the 10th. On the 10th, prices in Shanghai generally rose sharply. Although the Chiang bandit authorities intensified the implementation of "economic emergency measures," the Shanghai Chiang bandit garrison headquarters troops and economic police were all dispatched to monitor the market. All commodities, from daily necessities such as rice and fuel to luxury goods such as hot water bottles, rose to new record highs (Reuters). Rice has skyrocketed to 960,000 yuan per dan (AP). The black market exchange rate for US dollars was 125,000 on the 1st, rose to 132,000 on the 6th, and further soared to a new peak of 160,000 after the issuance of the new customs gold unit notes on the 10th. Gold prices have also risen by at least 20%. At the same time, public utility fees such as telegrams and telephones have increased threefold since the 11th. Postage has also increased since the 11th, with ordinary letters increasing to 2,000 yuan per letter and ordinary express letters increasing to 7,000 yuan, with a return receipt costing as much as 10,000 yuan. According to UPI, even beggars had already refused to accept Chiang currency notes below 1,000 yuan even before the new customs gold unit notes were issued.
