Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 9th -- Significant progress has been made in the unified management of village finances in Shenze, Shulu, and other counties in central Hebei, greatly reducing the burden on the masses and overcoming the chaotic and wasteful phenomena in village finances. Shenze County has decided to create biannual budgets for village finances based on the expenditure standards of A, B, C, D, extra-large, and extra-small villages, which are collected together with teacher salaries and deposited in a unified treasury (with separate accounts) managed by the district. Funds are distributed quarterly. The salaries of teachers in senior primary, junior primary, and primary schools, as well as the expenses of senior primary schools, are managed and distributed in a unified manner by the county, with adjustments made by the district under the control of the county. Since implementation began in July, the following results have been achieved: (1) Counties and districts allocate burdens to villages based on budgets, controlling income and expenditure, and overcoming the wasteful phenomenon of arbitrary collection and expenditure in villages in the past. (2) The village grain collection system has been improved, with timely collection and full deposit into the treasury, eliminating outstanding arrears. (3) The phenomena of misappropriation, lending, advance payments, and waste in villages have been reduced. (4) The expenditure system has been adhered to, ensuring teacher salaries. (5) Village finances have begun to pay attention to savings, proposing that surpluses be returned to the village to reduce the burden on the local masses. Before unified management, the average biannual burden per capita was about three catties. After unified management, the burden per capita in most villages is just over one catty (the county average is one catty and three taels per capita). After the successful demonstration of unified finance in the Sixth District of Shulu County, it has been推广 to villages in various districts. Among the county's 326 administrative villages, 297 have been able to prepare budgets and final accounts and report them according to the system. The Sixth District of the county, from April to September, adhered to the reporting system, settled accounts monthly, and announced them to the farmers. The budgeted millet totaled more than 95,000 catties, and firewood totaled more than 80,000 catties. The actual expenditure was more than 75,000 catties of millet and more than 56,000 catties of firewood, saving a total of more than 19,000 catties of millet and more than 24,000 catties of firewood. Based on the above expenditure figures, the average biannual burden per capita in the district is only one catty and two taels of millet. The villages in the district have also organized Yunnong Goods Stations to engage in production and support and assist the production of the masses in the district, and have now obtained more than seven million in profits. If this continues, the district will no longer need to collect village grain from farmers next year.

    统一管理村财政
    【新华社晋察冀九日电】冀中深泽、束鹿等县，村财政统一管理已获显著成绩，群众负担大大减轻。并克服了村财政的紊乱浪费现象。深泽决定村财政按甲、乙、丙、丁、特大、特小村之开支标准，造半年概算，与教员粮一并征收，统一入库（分别注帐）由区管理，按季分发，高初小教员粮连高小经费均以县为单位，按分数统筹统支，由区管理，由县掌握调剂。从七月份执行以来获得如下成绩：（一）县区向村根据概算分配负担量，掌握入库与开支，克服了村中已往任意征收任意开支的浪费现象。（二）健全了村粮征收制度，按期征收，全部入库，不再存留尾欠。（三）减少了村中挪借垫支与浪费现象。（四）坚持了开支制度，保证了教员供给。（五）村财政开始注意节约，提出了节余归村，减轻了本村群众负担。统筹前，每分半年约平均负担三斤上下；统管后，大部村庄每分负担一斤多（全县平均每分负担一斤三两）。束鹿六区统筹财政示范成功后，已推广到各区村，全县三百二十六个行政村，已能造预决算，按制度报帐者已达二百九十七村。该县六区自四月到九月半年中，坚持造报制度，按月结帐，向农民公布。预算小米共为九万五千余斤，木柴八万余斤，合计实开支小米七万五千余斤，木柴五万六千余斤，共节约小米一万九千余斤，木柴二万四千余斤。按以上开支数，该区半年平均每个富力分仅合负担小米一斤二两。该区各村并组织裕农货栈，经营生产，扶植与帮助本区群众生产，现已得红利七百余万。如照此坚持下去，明年该区即可不再向农民征收村粮。
