Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 4th: Fu Zuoyi, Chiang Kai-shek's running dog who recently seized the leadership of the Kuomintang army in North China, immediately adopted a defensive posture after taking office, declaring to foreign reporters that he was waiting for the "Communist attack on large cities." An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 5th reflected the opinions of the US imperialist "diplomatic officials and military attachés" stationed in China, complaining that Chiang's bandit military authorities were clinging to their "theory of defending cities, which was already outdated a hundred years ago," and believed that Fu's remarks were "mostly due to the critical military situation he faced." These representatives of US imperialism lamented: "The Communists are now able to determine the course of the entire war and operate freely, while the government troops (referring to Chiang's bandit troops) are being mobilized to build fortifications and wait for attacks." According to the Associated Press, Fu's appointment as the Commander-in-Chief of Chiang's bandit North China Army has caused new internal conflicts within Chiang's bandit ranks. Sun Lianzhong, who was removed from the position of Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters but retained the title of Chiang's bandit "Chairman of Hebei Province," has "resigned" to Chiang's bandit Peiping Executive Headquarters, while Fu himself is trying to explain that he is not "superior to Yan Xishan, because he was once Yan's subordinate." According to a Reuters dispatch on the 6th, Chiang's bandit Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi flew from Hankou to Xinyang, indicating that the military situation of Chiang's bandit troops in North China was not "optimistic."

    傅作义上台后
    摆出挨打姿态
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据合众社北平四日消息：新近夺得华北国民党军领导实权的蒋介石走狗傅作义，上台之后，即摆出挨打姿态，向外国记者宣称他等待着“共产党进攻大城市”。美联社于其五日南京电讯中反映美帝国主义驻华“外交官员及军事参赞”的意见，埋怨蒋匪军事当局固守其“一百年前便已不时髦了的固守城池的理论”，并认为傅贼谈话“大部分是由于面临着危急的军事情况”。这些美帝国主义的代表哀叫：“共产党现在能够决定整个战争的进程，自由作战，而政府军（指蒋匪军）则被动员去建筑防御工事，等待攻击。”据美联社称，傅贼之被任命为蒋匪华北军总司令，已引起蒋匪内部新的矛盾，被免除保定绥署主任仅保留蒋匪“河北省主席”的孙连仲，已向蒋匪北平行辕“辞职”，而傅贼本人则尽力解释他还不是“阎锡山的上级，因他曾一度是阎的部下”。另据路透社六日消息，蒋匪国防部长白崇禧由汉口飞往信阳，乃表示华北蒋匪军事情况未可“乐观”。
