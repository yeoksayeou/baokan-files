	Strengthen the Reserve Force for the Counter-Offensive!
	New Soldiers from Puyang Join the Army and are Officially Formed into a Replacement Brigade
	[This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, 17th] Over 11,000 young and strong men from Puyang County who joined the army have been officially formed into a replacement brigade. All the new soldiers gathered on the 3rd of this month to take an oath and hold a ceremony for the establishment of the replacement brigade. Brigade Commander Wei delivered an opening speech, saying: "The formal establishment of the Puyang Replacement Brigade is the greatest honor of the people of Puyang. We are all liberated peasants. In order to liberate all the Chinese people, we must fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive! Now everyone should step up their efforts to learn military skills and how to kill the enemy, and strive to become a strong revolutionary fighter." Political Commissar Liu then spoke, praising the labor heroes, guerrilla war heroes, and model land reform workers who joined the army. He said: "In the future, we must add merit to merit, overthrow Old Chiang, and dig out the root of the landlords!" Immediately afterwards, slogans resounded throughout the venue: "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek to live in peace!" "Be a hero in land reform, and perform great deeds by joining the army!" Finally, County Head He spoke on behalf of the rear area masses, saying: "Our rear area will do our utmost to organize farm-labor teams and comfort groups to ensure that the families of soldiers are not troubled. Your home is our home, and your parents are my parents." Before taking the oath, the new soldiers also spoke one after another. Fang Lin, a new soldier from the 3rd Regiment, said: "In the past, we were all oppressed and suffering masses. After the Eighth Route Army came, it led us to turn ourselves over, have food to eat, clothes to wear, and land. In order to protect our land and food bowls, we resolutely overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and will not return home until the bandit Chiang is destroyed. We left gloriously, and we will return gloriously!" After the new soldiers took the collective oath, they then passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, determined to kill the enemy, guarantee obedience to discipline, and help the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to turn themselves over.
