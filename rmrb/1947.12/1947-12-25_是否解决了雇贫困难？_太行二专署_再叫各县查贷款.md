　　Has the Difficulty of Employing the Poor Been Solved?
  　The Second Administrative Office of the Taihang Region
  　Calls on All Counties to Re-examine Loans
    [Report from this newspaper in the Taihang region] The Second Administrative Office has once again instructed all counties and districts to earnestly conduct inspections of loans to see whether they have met the needs of employing the poor. According to the current situation, some places, after receiving loans, are slow to distribute them and fail to boldly and quickly lend them out according to the needs of the masses. Even if the masses receive loans, it is only for a short time, hindering production. Some places only focus on quickly distributing the loans to the masses without further helping to check whether they have been used for production. Although the loans have been issued, they have not yet had an effect. The reason for this is a one-sided understanding of loans, without knowing how to organize the masses for production. The instructions require everyone to pay serious attention to correcting the phenomenon of egalitarianism in loans and to immediately conduct inspections based on whether the needs of employing the poor have been met, and to correct all errors.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　(Second Administrative Office)
    [Report from this newspaper in the Taihang region] Recently, the Second Administrative Office inspected the loan distribution in Northwest An Village, Pingding. When the village distributed 350,000 yuan in agricultural loans this year, it discovered many errors. One rich peasant obtained a loan of 3,000 yuan, while 198 poor peasant families did not receive a single penny. Similarly, there were also great errors in the 400,000 yuan disaster relief loans. Two bankrupt landlords received 5,000 yuan in silver dollars, while 107 poor peasant families at the basic level received nothing. The inspection of these two loans provides valuable lessons for us in issuing winter production loans and famine relief loans. Our class ideology in loan distribution is not clear, and the even bigger mistake is that loans are lent to rich peasants and bankrupt landlords. In distribution, the majority of loans are given to middle peasants, while the broad masses of poor peasants do not receive any. In situations like this, all localities need to launch a mass inspection movement and strictly correct them. (Taihang Second Administrative Office)

### 是否解决了雇贫困难？　太行二专署　再叫各县查贷款

　　是否解决了雇贫困难？
  　太行二专署
  　再叫各县查贷款
    【本报太行讯】二专署再次指示各县区，认真进行检查贷款，是否满足了雇贫要求。根据目前情况，有的地方在分配到贷款后，迟迟不发放，不能根据群众要求大胆迅速的贷出，这样即使群众得到贷款，也为时很短，妨碍了生产。有的地方只注意把贷款迅速分配给群众，不进一步去帮助检查是否已经用到生产上去，虽然款贷出去了，但还没有发生作用。产生这种原因，是片面的了解贷款，而不知道组织群众进行生产。指示要求大家严重注意纠正贷款上的平均现象，并以是否满足雇贫要求为尺度，立即进行检查，并纠正一切错误。

    【本报太行讯】最近二专署检查平定西北岸村贷款发放情况，今年该村发放三十五万元农贷时，发现错误甚多，一户富农就贷上三千元款，而一百九十八户雇贫群众，连一文钱都没有贷上。在四十万元的灾情贷款里，同样也有极大的错误，破产地主两户就贷洋五千元，而一百零七户雇贫基本群众则一点都没贷上。从检查这两宗贷款里，给我们发放冬季生产贷款、渡荒贷款提供了宝贵的教训，我们在贷款上的阶级思想不明确，更错误的是贷款贷在富农破产地主的手里，在分配上，多数贷款又交给了中农，而广大的雇贫群众却没有贷上。象这样的情形，各地都需要展开一个群众性的检查运动，严加纠正。（太行二专办公室）
