    The Development of CCP Influence in Japan
    by Hugh Deane
    Originally published in the June 28th issue of the Shanghai *China Weekly Review*

    The Chinese Communist Party is already exerting a very strong influence in Japan. The American occupation authorities have been alarmed by this fact. Although it is a bit late, MacArthur's staff is still trying to cope with it.

    The Japanese Communist Party has about 70,000 members. They now prefer to follow the ideology of the CCP as a guide, rather than relying solely on the writings of Western Marxists. Mao Zedong is increasingly revered as a theorist equal to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Pre-war Marxist analysis of Japanese society—including that endorsed by the Communist International—is being criticized and revised, partly based on Mao's writings.

    The CCP's influence in Japan is partly due to the efforts of Nozaka Sanzo (Nozaka Sanzō, also known as Okano Susumu). He is the leader of the Japanese Communist Party, who worked in Yan'an under the name Okano Susumu during the later years of the war. But more fundamentally, this fact (i.e., the CCP's influence in Japan) reflects the growing strength of the CCP and also indicates the adaptation of Marxist thought to Asian conditions.

    Publications about the CCP have the widest circulation

    Apparently, what is troubling the American occupation authorities is that the CCP's influence has greatly expanded beyond the ranks of the Japanese Communist Party. The Japanese people, in general, seem to have an insatiable desire to learn about the Chinese Communist Party. This may be partly due to the CCP's success in fighting the Japanese army in North and Central China. Publications about the CCP almost automatically achieve the widest circulation.

    Two translations of Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy" were published and immediately sold out. His other two works, "On Protracted War" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," have also been published.

    Some Japanese writers have also published works on the Chinese revolutionary movement. Among these works, the most substantial is that of Nakanishi. In April of this year, Nakanishi was elected as a member of the House of Councillors. It now seems no wonder that so many Japanese people spent years in China conducting research that would not have been approved by the Japanese warlords. However, Nakanishi was eventually arrested and imprisoned in 1944. The popular book now available is what he began to write in prison at that time.

    The Japanese left-wing writer, Kaji Wataru, lived in Shanghai under the protection of Lu Xun for a period of time. During the war, he lived in Chongqing, wanting to serve the Chinese people. Despite the heavy difficulties of censorship, he managed to publish several very popular novels and articles about China.

    The CCP is admired

    Another very influential book here is Huang Yanpei's "Returning from Yan'an," published by Jiji Press.

    All writings about the Chinese Communist Party are uniformly sympathetic; although there are very few writings with a more gray perspective, such as Songmoto Sokichi's "Biography of Mao Zedong." In Tokyo, there was even a drama being performed: the righteous characters in the play are Chinese guerrillas, obviously led by the Communist Party; the villains are the Japanese Imperial Army. The audience relentlessly hissed at the villains in the play.

    Alarmed by the expansion of the CCP's influence, the American occupation authorities have now taken restrictive measures. In January of this year, Snow's "Red Star Over China" was published. It immediately sold out. Officials from MacArthur's Civil Information and Education Section, apparently disliking the popularity of this book, withheld the second part of it, "More Red Star Over China," for more than three months, preventing its publication.

    Two books by Snow's wife, "China Builds for Democracy," which is about the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, and "China's Labor Movement," have also been withheld for more than nine months.

    Now, the American occupation authorities have banned the publication of two other works by Mao Zedong; citing copyright relations as an excuse. MacArthur's officials told a Japanese publisher that before considering allowing publication, they must first obtain a permit signed by Mao himself.

    In addition, in recent months, due to stricter censorship, works on the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Civil War have been greatly suppressed. A dispatch from a news agency here, an article by Anna Louise Strong, was withheld because it reported that the New Fourth Army had captured a large amount of American equipment.

    中共影响在日本的发展
    作者休·第尼
    原文载六月廿八日上海密勒氏评论报
    中国共产党，在日本，已经发生着非常强大的影响。对于这一事实，美国占领当局，已经惊惶起来。虽然有点不中用了，麦克阿瑟的人员们还在想法应付呢。
    日本共产党，大约有七万党员。他们现在宁要依从中共的思想，作为向导，倒不一定要紧靠西方马克斯主义者的著作的。毛泽东，日益被推崇，成为和马、恩、列、斯相等同的理论家。战前马克思主义者对于日本社会的分析——包括共产国际所赞同的在内——正在部分地依据毛氏的著作，加以批判和修正。
    中共在日本的影响，部分地是由于野坂铁（野铁参贰，即冈野进）的努力。他是日共的领袖，在战争的后几年，取名冈野进，在延安工作。但是，比较基本地，这一事实（按即中共在日本的影响），正反映了中共力量的壮大，也指明了马克思思想对于亚洲条件的适应。
    关于中共的出版物得到了最广泛的销路
    显然，美国占领当局所伤脑筋的，是中共影响大大地扩展到了日共党员范围之外。日本人民，一般地，对于中国共产党，好象有一种不能满足的追求心理一样。这可能部分地是由于中共在华中华北抗击日军的成功。关于中共的出版物，几乎是自动地，得到最广泛的销路。
    毛泽东的新民主主义论有两个译本出版，马上就都卖完了。他的其他两种著作，论持久战和在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，也出了书。
    日本作家关于中国革命运动的一些著作，也出版了。这些著作当中，内容最丰富的，要推中西的作品。今年四月，中西被选为参议院议员。现在看起来，无怪乎当年那样多的日本人，多年在中国，进行日本军阀所不会赞同的研究工作。然而，中西终于在一九四四年被捕入狱。现在流行的书，就是他那时在监狱里开始写的。
    日本左翼作家鹿地亘，有一个时期，在鲁讯的庇护下，住在上海。战争期间，住在重庆，要给中国人民服务。虽然有书报检查的重重困难，他总算是出版了几种流行极广的关于中国的小说和文章。
    中共被仰慕着
    在这里，另外一种影响很大的书，是时事新闻社出版的黄炎培作的“延安归来”。
    所有关于中国共产党的著作、是一致同情的；虽然也有极少数带了比较灰色面貌的著作，如象松本曾吉的“毛泽东传”。在东京，甚至曾经演出这样一个戏剧：剧中的正派是中国游击队，显然是共产党领导的；反派是日本的皇军。观众对剧中的反派，无情地发出厌恨的嗤声。
    美国占领当局，惶恐着中共影响的扩大，现在已经采取限制办法。今年一月，斯诺的“西行漫记”出了版。马上就卖完了。麦克阿瑟的社会情报教育科的官员们，显然厌恶这种书的流行，便把它的第二部分“西行漫记续集”，扣压了三个多月，不让出版。
    斯诺夫人所著的两本书：“中国民主建设”，这是讲中国工业合作社的，和“中国劳工运动”，也都被扣压了九个多月。
    现在，美国占领当局，又禁止了其他两种毛泽东著作的出版；借口说是版权关系。麦克阿瑟的官员们，对一位日本出版商这样讲：在考虑允许出版问题以前，必须先拿来毛氏签字的许可证件。
    另外，最近几个月来，因为检查的更加严厉，关于中国共产党和中国内战的作品，已经大大地被压制起来。电报通讯社在这里发出的，安娜·斯特朗的一篇文章被扣压起来，因为里面报导说新四军缴获了大量的美国装备。（棣华译）
