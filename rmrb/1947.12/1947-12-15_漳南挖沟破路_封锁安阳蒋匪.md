　　[This Newspaper's Jinan, 12th Dispatch] To protect grain, land, and their hometown, the people of the 7th District of Zhangnan are actively fighting the enemy. The people often report enemy movements to the district and county governments, enabling us to surround and attack the enemy whenever they enter a village. Recently, villages have been digging trenches and destroying roads to further blockade the enemy. In the cold weather, the masses, sweating, discuss: "With the communication trenches dug well, it will be convenient for us to move around and make it difficult for the enemy to move an inch." "With the trenches blockading the enemy dug well, our things cannot be snatched away. We are determined to trap the enemy in the city and annihilate them outside the city..." Old men and children in Dong and Xi Feng villages also participated in the digging with high morale, exceeding the tasks assigned. For example, the Hong Village militia, with thirty-five people, were assigned seventeen and a half zhang of frozen ground, yet they completed forty-five zhang in one day.

    漳南挖沟破路
    封锁安阳蒋匪
    【本报冀南十二日电】漳南七区老百姓保粮保田保家乡，积极对敌斗争。老百姓常找区部、县政府报告敌情，使敌人每到一村，即被我包围打击。近日各村更挖沟破路，进一步封锁敌人。在寒冷的天气中，群众一面流着汗，一面谈论：“挖好了交通沟，咱们跑着方便，叫敌人寸步难行，”“封锁敌人的沟挖好，咱们的东西抢不走，坚决把敌人困死在城内，消灭在城外………。”东、西冯村老头小孩也参加挖，情绪高昂，都超过了任务。如洪村自卫队三十五人，共分冻地十七丈五尺，一天即完成了四十五丈。
