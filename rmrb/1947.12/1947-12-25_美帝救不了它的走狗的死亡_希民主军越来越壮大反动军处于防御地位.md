　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. TASS reports indicate that the guns and money of American imperialism cannot save its running dog, the Greek fascist government, from its inevitable demise. According to Reynolds, a reporter for the Chicago Sun, since American imperialism's intervention in Greece, the Greek Democratic Army has not weakened but has instead grown stronger than ever. In northern Greece, for example, the Democratic Army fighting in the mountains numbered only 2,000 last year, but has now grown to 25,000, an increase of more than tenfold. The Democratic Army's powerful and victorious offensive has placed the more than 150,000-strong Greek army and so-called National Guard, which are extremely well-equipped and supplied, on the defensive. American imperialism's recent elevation of Sophoulis of the Liberal Party to the position of Prime Minister in order to deceive world opinion and win over the Greek people, thereby saving the royalist fascist government, has completely failed. According to Reynolds, Sophoulis openly admitted to him that "he is a Liberal Party member captured in the political control of the royalist Tsaldaris" and a "political decoration."

　　美帝救不了它的走狗的死亡
  　希民主军越来越壮大反动军处于防御地位
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合塔斯社讯：美帝国主义的大炮与金元，挽救不了其走狗希腊法西斯政府注定的死亡。据芝加哥太阳报访员雷诺尔德称：自美帝国主义干涉希腊以来，希腊民主军不仅没有削弱，反而空前壮大了。以希腊北部为例，去年在山中作战的民主军只有两千人，现在已发展到两万五千人，较前增加十倍以上。现民主军的强大胜利攻势，已使装备与供应极为优良的十五万以上的希腊陆军与所谓国民警卫队，处于防御地位。美帝国主义最近抬出自由党索佛利斯任总理，以便欺骗世界舆论与拢络希腊人心，借以拯救保皇党法西斯政府之企图已完全失败。据雷诺尔德称：索福利斯公开向他承认：“他是保皇党曹达利斯政治把持中被俘的自由党人”与“政治上的装饰品”。
