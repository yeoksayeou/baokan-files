　　School News in Brief
　　　　Xingtai No. 9 Elementary School Plans Year-End Propaganda
　　[Our Newspaper, Xingtai] As the end of the year approaches, Xingtai No. 9 Elementary School has decided to take two days off during the New Year to conduct propaganda work. They have decided to tell every villager about the great changes in the situation this year and have set out three propaganda methods: (1) Dramatic performances for propaganda, preparing to write a play in which Chiang Kai-shek, the enemy of the people, appears. (2) Printing counter-offensive maps, using two colors to mark the areas attacked by the enemy last year and the areas liberated during this year's counter-offensive, and distributing them to various villages. (3) Each student will conduct propaganda in village winter schools, textile groups, and youth literacy classes, writing letters to relatives and friends to tell them about the victory news. In addition to completing the three propaganda items, they also plan to cut firewood and carry water for military families.

　　　　Pinging No. 1 Teachers' School Students Launch Creative Movement
　　[Our Newspaper, Pingding] To welcome the New Year and promote the great counter-offensive propaganda, all teachers and students of No. 1 Teachers' School have launched a creative competition since the 2nd of this month. Not only has it provided propaganda materials, but it has also improved each student's writing ability. The students are very enthusiastic. Comrade Gao Renyi put forward three points of opinion on the content of writing: (1) Whether it is a clapper talk or an opera, it should be short and concise, grasping the core. (2) Combine with practical, specific, and popular language. (3) It should be coordinated with the current central work. After everyone discussed it, individual and group competitions began, and mutual assistance groups were established. For example, Qu He, a cook who is illiterate, orally reads production clapper talks, and Comrade Li Zhanchun, the administrative officer, writes them down on his behalf. The content is specific, vivid, and loved by everyone. After a week, seven groups have compiled 31 items, including clapper talks, short plays, and ditties.
