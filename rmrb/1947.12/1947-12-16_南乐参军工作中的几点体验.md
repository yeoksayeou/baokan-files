Some Experiences in the Conscription Work in Nanle
Cadres went from not believing in the masses' awareness to believing in the masses' awareness.

The reason why the conscription work in Nanle was done well was mainly because it relied on the method of "handing over conscription to the masses for discussion," turning it into the masses' own business, and implementing the mass line. Moreover, in the actual movement, it educated the cadres, making them go from not believing in the masses' awareness to believing in the masses' awareness. At the beginning of the conscription work, some cadres still had many confused ideas about "the mass line, voluntary participation," thinking that "voluntary participation would definitely mean no one enlisting." Some cadres opposed the mass line and voluntary participation to the completion of numerical targets, asking which of the two was more important. If completing the numerical target was important, then some degree of coercion was unavoidable, otherwise, what would happen if no one went? In fact, this all stemmed from the cadres' serious lack of belief in the masses' awareness. Why didn't they believe in the masses' awareness? First, the cadres didn't focus on the positive aspects, failing to fully recognize that the peasants after liberation had the desire to join the army to protect their gains and avenge their grievances by eliminating Chiang Kai-shek. Second, the cadres first burdened themselves with ideological baggage, fearing that the masses' discussion would lead to them being asked to join the army. However, after the tasks were assigned to the villages, the villages that handed over the tasks to the masses, had them discussed, and gradually enlightened the masses' thinking, quickly started a conscription upsurge, such as Zhang Santun in the Second District and Mao Village in the Fifth District. On the contrary, if the tasks were not handed over to the masses, and only simple mobilization methods were adopted, the tasks would be completed slowly, and eventually it would be necessary to return to the path of the mass line, starting from ideological mobilization again, to achieve voluntary participation. Therefore, in the actual movement, the cadres were truly educated, making them realize that handing it over to the masses was never wrong.

Implementing the Mass Line Starts with Smoothing Out Cadres' Thinking

In the conscription work, timely enlightenment, guidance, and education from the leadership to gradually raise the masses' awareness can improve the movement step by step. However, to enable cadres to play such a role, it is necessary to first resolve their ideological concerns and make them put down their burdens. In this work, it is very clear that cadres who have resolved their ideological problems dare to boldly believe in and rely on the masses in their work, coming up with many ways to solve problems. For example, Zhao Ziming, the director of the farmers' association in Zhang Santun, had sufficient ideological preparation and was not afraid of the masses urging him to join the army, so he came up with many ways to mobilize the masses and relied on the masses, educating other cadres. Conversely, cadres in Qiankou Village had many ideological concerns and were afraid of mass discussions, so they could not complete their tasks well.

Family Meetings are Very Effective

Holding family meetings universally is also a characteristic of this conscription work in Nanle. The reason why the conscription work in Donghou Village in the First District was done well was mainly because family meetings were held universally. First, cadres held family meetings to clear up the thinking in their own families, willing to send their sons to join the army, and then let their family members connect with other families. At the beginning, because family meetings were not held first, the mass meetings in the first three days were met with silence from the masses. Later, after the family meetings were held well, thirty-six young men signed up to join the army.

The Process of Conscription Work is the Process of Ideological Mobilization

The process of conscription work is actually the process of ideological mobilization. In the actual movement, this path was gradually clarified and implemented in a timely manner. Because it was gradually clarified through exploration, the ideological mobilization was extremely uneven in Nanle. In some villages, the masses' awareness was high, and they naturally recalled the bitter life of the past, linking it to their own vital interests, wanting to protect their gains from liberation. After their ideological awareness gradually increased, they voluntarily joined the army. In other villages, they only talked about conscription tasks for the sake of conscription, so the masses' discussion was "whoever has more brothers should go," rather than enlightening their ideological awareness so that they could meet the requirements for joining the army. This was all because they did not start with ideological mobilization.

    南乐参军工作中的几点体验
    干部从不相信群众觉悟到相信群众觉悟
    南乐参军工作所以做得好，主要的是依靠“把参军交群众讨论”，变成群众自己的事情，贯彻了群众路线的方法，而且在实际运动中，教育了干部，使干部从不相信群众的觉悟到相信群众的觉悟。参军工作开始，有些干部对“群众路线、自觉自愿”还有着许多糊涂观念，认为“自觉自愿那一定没有人参军”，有的干部把群众路线自觉自愿，与完成数目字对立起来，提出究竟两者那个重要？如果完成数目字重要，那就不免要有点强迫命令，不然，没有人去怎么办？其实，这都是干部思想中严重的存着不相信群众觉悟的观点。为什么不相信群众的觉悟呢？第一、干部没有从积极方面着眼，没有充分认识到翻身后的农民，是有参军保产灭蒋复仇的要求；第二、干部首先背上思想包袱，怕群众讨论要自己参军。可是任务布置到村后，凡是任务交给群众，经过群众讨论，并逐渐启发群众思想觉悟的村庄，很快就搞起了参军热潮，象二区的张三屯、五区的卯村等。相反的，如不把任务交给群众，只采取简单的动员方式，结果会迟迟完不成任务，而最后又必须回到群众路线的道路上，重新从思想发动作起，达到自觉自愿。所以，在实际运动中，真正教育了干部，使干部认识到交给群众办就是没错。
    贯彻群众路线首先打通干部思想
    在参军工作中，领导上能及时的启发诱导和教育，逐步提高群众的觉悟，就能使运动逐步提高。不过要使干部起到这样的作用，必须首先解决其思想顾虑，使其放下包袱。在这工作中，看得很清楚，凡是思想问题解决好的干部，他在工作中就敢大胆的相信群众、依靠群众，想出很多办法、解决问题，例如张三屯农会主任赵自明，有充分的思想准备，不怕群众拥他参军，所以他思想出许多办法，把群众发动起来，依靠群众，教育了其他干部。反之，象千口村的干部，思想上的顾虑很多，害怕群众讨论，因而不能很好的完成任务。
    家庭会收效大
    普遍开家庭会议，也是南乐这次参军工作中的特点。一区的东侯村，这次参军工作所以搞得好，主要是普遍召开家庭会议，首先是干部开家庭会议，把自己家里的思想打通，愿意送郎送子参军，然后再让家里的人去别家串通。该村开始，因为没有先开家庭会议，头三天开群众会，群众都不哼，后来家庭会开好了，就有三十六个青壮报名参军。
    参军工作的过程是思想发动的过程
    参军工作的过程，实际上是思想发动的过程，在实际运动中，逐渐明确了这条道路，而且及时贯彻下去。因为是摸索中逐渐明确，所以在南乐来说，思想发动是极不平衡的，有的村庄群众的觉悟高，很自然的回忆起过去的苦生活，联系到自己的切身利益，要保卫自己的翻身果实，思想觉悟逐步提高后，自觉自愿的参军；而有的村庄，则是就参军任务而谈参军，所以群众讨论就是“谁弟兄多的谁去”，而不是启发其思想觉悟，使其能达到参军要求，这都是由于没有从思想发动着手的结果。
