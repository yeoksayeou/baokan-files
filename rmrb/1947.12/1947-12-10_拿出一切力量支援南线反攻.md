　　Devote All Strength to Support the Southern Front Counter-Offensive

　　The high tide of China's New Democratic Revolution has already emerged. The national military situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us. From the Northeast to the Yangtze River, from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia to Jiaodong, our People's Liberation Army is carrying out large-scale counter-offensives and has already achieved brilliant victories. Liu and Deng's army established the Dabie Mountain base area, established 34 democratic county governments, and liberated more than five million people; Chen and Su's army swept through the Huai River area, establishing three new special districts in addition to the original three democratic special districts in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu region, liberating more than 20 million people; Chen and Xie's army penetrated deep into the Henan-Shaanxi border area, establishing seven sub-districts and 37 democratic county governments. The people in these newly liberated areas are now launching a movement to turn themselves over, and the landlords' armed forces are being systematically eliminated. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's national strategic deployment has been completely smashed, and the new base areas established by our People's Liberation Army have all gained a firm foothold and begun to enter a consolidation phase.
    This great victory was won by the people themselves. The people's enthusiasm for liberating themselves is unprecedented in Chinese history. In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region alone, 300,000 young and strong men joined the People's Liberation Army in the past year, and 100 million man-days of manual labor participated in war service, and the material and financial resources invested in the war were even greater. This self-sacrificing contribution is the root of the victory of our army on the southern front, and it will become the guarantee of the victory of the liberation of the whole country.
    The entire revolutionary situation is so clear, and victory is so certain and approaching. In the second year of the war, our army on the southern front will shoulder even greater tasks to annihilate even more enemies. The declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 36th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution clearly pointed out this bright direction. The eight major programs in the declaration are the hope of all Chinese people. From the spirit of the declaration and the specific development of the national military situation, we deeply realize that now it is not a question of whether we can win, but a question of whether we dare to win, that is, whether we dare to put all the strength we have accumulated into this great battle. In the past, we pointed out that we should prepare and accumulate enough strength to use it at the most necessary time to win a decisive victory. This plan was correct; now that time has come. Therefore, we must use our strength unreservedly and send as many personnel, materials, ammunition, and cadres as possible to the front line and the new base areas. This is necessary to exchange for national victory.
    Therefore, we call on all party, government, military, and civilian organs, schools, and groups in the rear to tighten their establishments, practice thrift, reduce living standards, thoroughly reorganize village finances, and send all possible surplus personnel and wealth to the front line. Every revolutionary worker must carry forward the spirit of serving the people and preparing to sacrifice everything, absolutely obey the organization's arrangements, and be ready to be transferred to the front at any time. Comrades who remain in the rear must diligently undertake more and heavier work, firmly establish their proletarian revolutionary stance, and better serve the people. Advocate destroying families to relieve the country's difficulties, and all improperly obtained private wealth should be automatically and completely returned to the people to redeem their sins. Today is the time to test the revolutionary qualities of every comrade, and all selfishness and fear of difficulties will be criminal acts.
    We call on all production departments to further expand the large-scale production movement, increase production, save raw materials, improve quality, accurately calculate, and scientifically manage. Worker comrades, carry forward your glorious proletarian tradition of heroic sacrifice and overcoming difficulties. The workers and staff of military factories must make more and better guns and ammunition to send to the front. The workers and staff of all factories and mines must guarantee civilian and military needs and increase the wealth of the liberated areas. Production is like fighting a battle, and more production is equal to winning more battles.
    We call on the 30 million people in the entire region to continue your spirit of sacrificing everything to support the war, prepare to continue sending a large number of young and strong men to the front, and in large-scale war service, better implement scientific calculation, meticulous organization, and reduce all waste. Resolutely and thoroughly eliminate feudal forces, complete the tiller's own land, and establish a democratic regime that truly represents the interests of the people under the leadership of poor and lower-middle peasants. Organize more universally, launch a production movement on the basis of land distribution, get rid of poverty and improve living standards.
    China's revolutionary war has entered a new period, the humiliating history of the people is about to end, and the glorious era of the people is about to begin. We must bravely welcome this great victory, and we will surely achieve victory.
    Devote all our strength to support the front-line counter-offensive!
    Fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!

### 拿出一切力量支援南线反攻

　　拿出一切力量支援南线反攻
    中国新民主主义的大革命高潮已经出现。全国军事形势对我空前有利，从东北到长江，从陕甘宁到胶东，我解放军都在进行大举反攻，并已获得辉煌战果。刘邓军创立了大别山根据地，建立了三十四个民主县政府，解放了五百余万人民；陈粟军席卷河淮，除豫皖苏区原有三个民主专员公署外，又建立了三个新的专署，被解放人民二千余万；陈谢军深入豫陕边，建立了七个分区，三十七个民主县政府。这些新解放区人民现正掀起翻身运动，地主武装正被次第肃清。蒋匪全国战略部署整个被粉碎，我各路解放军所创立的新根据地，均已立稳脚跟，开始进入巩固阶段。
    这一伟大胜利是人民自己所赢得的。人民从事解放自己的革命热情，在中国历史上为前所未见，仅我晋冀鲁豫区，一年来即有三十万青壮年涌入人民解放军，一万万个人工参加随军战争勤务，投入战争的物力财力更是浩大。这种自我牺牲的贡献，正是南线我军胜利的根源，也就将成为解放全国胜利的保证。
    整个革命局势是如此明朗，胜利是如此肯定和接近，在战争的第二年中，南线我军将担负更重大的任务，去更大量歼灭敌人。辛亥革命三十六周年纪念日中国人民解放军的宣言，已明确指出这一光明的方向，宣言中的八大政纲就是全中国人民希望寄托的所在。从宣言精神及全国军事形势的具体发展，我们深刻体会到：现在已不是能否胜利，而是敢不敢胜利的问题，也就是敢不敢把我们积蓄的一切力量全部投到这伟大战斗中去的问题。过去我们曾指出要准备和积蓄足够力量，在最必要的时候使用上去，以赢得决定的胜利。这种打算是正确的；现在这一时候已经到来了。因此我们要毫不保守的放手使用力量，尽量输送人员、物资、弹药、干部到前线和新根据地去。为了换取全国胜利，这是必要的。
    如此，我们号召一切党政军民各后方机关、学校、团体紧缩编制，历行节约，降低生活水准，彻底整理村财政，把一切可能节余的人员、财富送到前线去。每一个革命工作者，要发扬为人民服务准备牺牲一切的精神，绝对服从组织调动，随时准备调赴前方。留在后方工作的同志，要刻苦的担负起更多更重的工作，坚定自己的无产阶级的革命立场，去更好的为人民服务。提倡毁家纾难，一切不正当获得的私人财富，更应自动的全部的拿出来还给人民，赎取自己的罪恶。今天是考验每一个同志的革命品质的时候了，一切自私本位、害怕困难，都将是犯罪行为。
    我们号召一切生产部门，进一步展开大生产运动，增加生产、节省原料、提高质量、精确核算、科学管理。工人同志们发扬你们无产阶级的光荣传统英勇牺牲、克服困难的精神，军工厂的职工们要造更多更好的枪炮弹药送到前线去，一切工厂矿井的职工们要保证民用军需，并增加解放区财富。生产犹如作战，多一份生产就等于多打一个胜仗。
    我们号召全区三千万人民继续你们不惜牺牲一切的精神支援战争，准备继续送大批青壮年到前线去，在大规模战争勤务中，更好的实行科学计算，细密组织，减少一切浪费。坚决彻底消灭封建势力，完成耕者有其田，树立贫雇农领导的真正代表人民利益的民主政权。更普遍的组织起来，在分得土地的基础上展开生产运动，摆脱穷困改善生活。
    中国革命战争已进入新时期，人民屈辱的历史就将结束，人民光荣的时代即将开始，我们要勇敢的迎接这一伟大胜利，我们将一定取得胜利。
    拿出我们一切力量支援前线反攻！
    打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！
