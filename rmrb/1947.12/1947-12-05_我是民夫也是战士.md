　　I Am a Civilian Laborer and Also a Soldier
    Lu Sheng
    This is the story of Shang Haiquan, a liberated peasant, talking about his experience in the war.
    In March, during the Qingming Festival, the village of Hemenkou was buzzing with activity. The village chief conveyed the government's call to join the war to the villagers, and the liberated peasants eagerly signed up to participate. Shang Haiquan had just recovered from a three-month illness and was not yet physically strong, but he still wanted to sign up.
    The village chief said, "Haiquan! You can go next time! Your health is not yet up to it!"
    Haiquan said, "No! Participating in the war is for our own sake. Even if my body isn't strong, one more person is better than one less."
    The village chief tried to talk him out of it for a whole day, but it was no use. Finally, he allowed him to join the war.
    Before leaving, at the farewell meeting, Shang Haiquan raised his fist and said, "To defend our liberated leader Chairman Mao, to defend our fruits of victory, I want to sign up to participate in the war. This time I go, I won't come back without making a contribution."
    Two months later, Shang Haiquan indeed made a contribution in the Jinan campaign.
    When the news reached the village, everyone said, "Old Shang has a stubborn streak, he's both bold and daring." Some said, "This time he was selected as a special-class meritorious worker, it's a real honor for the people of Hemenkou Village!"
    When the Jinan battle ended, Shang Haiquan returned. As soon as he entered the village, village cadres and the masses surrounded him in a circle, asking him to tell his story of participating in the war.
    Just as everyone was arguing, the village chief came over, and the crowd immediately quieted down. The village chief walked over with a smile, forcibly took his luggage onto his own shoulders, shook his hand, and said, "Good Haiquan! At the time, I didn't want you to go. You were sick for three months before you left and your body wasn't strong, but you've come back looking radiant! Haha! Life at the front must be good?"
    "Of course! Life at the front is good, the army really cares for us civilian laborers." The village chief saw that he couldn't greet everyone in the crowd, so he quickly said, "Everyone, come on, let's wait until he sits down at home to tell his story."
    As soon as he returned home, two or three bowls of boiled water had already been prepared. He drank the water while saying, "I'm tired from walking today, so I can only tell a few stories." Everyone felt that no matter what he said, the things at the front were always fresh and interesting, and everyone wanted to listen.
    "Let's start with the battle of Jishan!" Shang Haiquan began to say:
    "It was my first time participating in the war. As soon as I joined the army, we walked more and faster every day. After walking for two days, although Jishan city was still more than a hundred li away, the higher-ups issued an order to rush there with all our might.
    "We carried ladders as we walked. We only ate one meal in a day and a night, and we continued to walk. At this time, everyone was tired and hungry. I was afraid that everyone would be tired, so I carried the ladder with all my might without switching, wanting others to switch more and rest more. I was also afraid that everyone would be hungry, so I took out my own dry rations and shared them with everyone.
    "Walk! Walk! We didn't reach our destination until our legs were sore. At this time, we heard that we were very close to the city. The troops were preparing to attack the city, and we received orders to put down the ladders. As soon as we put them down, a line of troops came to carry the ladders. I thought: what's going on? I stood there for a moment and saw that everyone who had been carrying the ladders had gone down, so I continued to carry the ladders with the troops. A comrade stopped me and said, 'Old fellow, go down and rest! We're about to attack the city!' I said, 'No! Comrade! I want to go too!' As I said that, I carried the ladder forward with him.
    "Before long, we saw the city wall in front of us. Suddenly, 'Boom! Boom!' two cannons fired. Oh my! It scared me! I thought the enemy's cannons were firing at us, but when I looked up, black smoke was rising from the city wall and the cannons were firing continuously. It turned out that our attack on the city had begun. At this time, I was afraid, but I didn't want to go down, so I bravely carried the ladder forward.
    "Just after passing a dirt ridge, before we had taken two steps, the ladder suddenly seemed to fly up and run really fast. I was carried by the ladder to the bottom of the city wall. A comrade said, 'Old fellow! Quickly help set up the ladder!' I was very scared and quickly helped to set up the ladder. I saw the comrades, covered in hand grenades, climbing straight up. At this time, I became even more afraid."
    A young man interrupted him and asked, "Then did you come down?"
    "No! No! When I saw the troops covered in hand grenades rushing up the city wall, I thought: others are going up, how can I go down? Later, I unknowingly grabbed the ladder and climbed up the city wall. Once I was up there, the troops were all fighting on the city wall. Some sacks of earth blocked the way. A troop called to me, 'Come! Comrade! Quickly use a shovel to dig a hole!' He gave me a small shovel, and I helped him dig a hole. After the hole was dug for a while, suddenly there was another loud boom! This time it almost scared me into falling off the city wall. When I got up and looked at the sacks, they had all become fragments. The troops were all shouting: Kill! Charge! Capture them alive! And ran into a series of large buildings."
    "At this time, Director Wang also came up, and I followed him to the bottom of the city. When I entered the enemy's county government, I picked up a small pistol, a basket of cigarettes, and a coat. I gave the pistol to Director Wang, distributed the cigarettes to everyone, and put the coat on a wounded soldier. I didn't want anything for myself."
    "Is that all?" A young man asked him again. He said, "That's just the first one, let's talk about the second one!"
    He took a few sips of water and said, "The second one is the battle of Meiyang!"
    "The battle of Meiyang was being fought fiercely when suddenly a command came from the front: 'Send three stretchers quickly to the front to rescue the wounded.' The squad leader asked everyone, 'Who will go?' I said I would go, and immediately more than ten people volunteered. Before leaving, the comrades in the troops told us, 'When you get to the front, use the terrain, don't run around, and be quick when carrying the wounded.'
    "We walked out dozens of steps, and the bullets were whistling, as if flying over our heads, and I couldn't help but lower my head. The comrades in the troops said, 'Don't be afraid, the bullets are high!' But I couldn't hold back and just ran with my head down.
    "After walking around a corner, the artillery shells and bullets were even louder. At this time, I saw Comrade Wang was already there. He said in a low voice, 'Old fellow! Put down the stretchers and go up to carry first!' I put down the stretchers, turned around, and saw that Director Wang had already lowered his head and ran forward. I followed him closely. My whole body was surrounded by the whistling of bullets. I wished I could burrow into the ground, and I lowered my head only a foot above the ground, running until my whole body was covered in cold sweat.
    "We ran into a depression in the ground. Director Wang said, 'Hurry up and carry them, no matter which one, carry them and leave, be careful and concealed on the road!' At this time, I saw several soldiers lying there. I carried one up and left. He was covered in blood, and I was covered in sweat. The blood and sweat flowed together, making my whole body wet.
    "I was really impatient. As soon as I left the depression, I carried the wounded soldier and ran with all my might, which made me unable to catch my breath, my head was dizzy, my eyes were black, and my chest hurt. The wounded comrade said, 'Old fellow! Don't run all the time, stop at the dirt ridges.' At this time, I remembered to use the terrain, and I ran around a corner and rested for a while, and carried him to the place where the stretchers were placed.
    "The second time I went to carry them, I learned to use the terrain and didn't exert myself so much, so I carried them down smoothly.
    "The fourth time I went up, the gunfire was not so intense. Director Wang said, 'The battle is over, we have captured more than six hundred enemies and obtained more than a dozen American-made heavy machine guns. There are no more wounded here, come on! Follow me into the village!'
    "As soon as I walked onto the street, I saw an enemy soldier running limping in a gully, holding a gun in his hand. I said, isn't that an enemy soldier? As I said that, I ran over and grabbed him around the waist and pressed him to the ground. When that guy turned his head, I smashed his face down with the butt of my gun. He twitched a few times and was done. I also searched a watch from his body.
    "The battle was completely over, and I helped Director Wang find the bodies of the martyrs and carried them together to the big temple outside the village, and slowly buried them behind the temple, and put up signs.
    "This time, I was very happy. The higher-ups saw that my clothes were covered in blood, so they gave me a new set of clothes." As he said that, he touched his new clothes with his hand.
    A young man asked him again, "Was that a reward for you?"
    "The reward is still to come, let's talk about the third battle, the battle of Yuncheng:
    "On the second day of the battle of Yuncheng, large door panels were needed on the front line. Sending large door panels required passing through dangerous areas, and no one dared to go. I said I would go! Director Wang said, 'The door panels are very big, one person is not enough, right?' I said I could carry them, and I carried them on my back and left. On the road, I stopped sometimes and ran sometimes, and delivered them to the front line without delaying everyone's use.
    "Later, the battle of Yuncheng ended, and the troops were about to transfer immediately. We still carried the ladders and walked, and entered a village three li away from Yuncheng. Suddenly, at a turning point in the middle of the village, an earthen wall blocked the ladders from turning. What to do? The enemy in Yuncheng kept firing artillery at the village, and we were afraid that the combat troops would withdraw and leave. Hundreds of people shouted: 'Hurry up! Hurry up!' 'Why aren't you moving forward?'...
    "I was anxious and went to the front to take a look. An earthen wall more than two zhang high was blocking the ladder from turning. There was no road there, and we had to pass through here. This was truly 'losing money after losing food!' We were anxious but there was nothing we could do.
    "The civilian laborers carrying the ladders shouted, and several comrades in the troops protecting the ladders also stomped their feet. No one had a solution. I looked at it and suddenly had an idea. I said to the people carrying the ladder in front: 'Come!' We lifted the ladder a little higher, and I went up! As soon as I got on the earthen wall, I quickly dug a layer of earth off the wall, jumped down the wall, found a hoe, and dug a ditch in front of the wall. Then I returned to the outside of the wall. I said: 'I'll count one, two! Everyone carry together, and we can knock the wall down.' So I shouted: 'One——two!' With a crash, the earthen wall fell down, and the ladder passed smoothly.
    "Later, when we returned to Wenxi to live, there were commendation meetings, merit evaluation meetings, and congratulatory meetings. Everyone said that I had contributed a lot and gave me many prizes. When we came back, an endless line of troops lined up outside the village to see us off, and the brigade commander also poured me wine and presented flowers..."
    "It's really glorious! It's really glorious!" People kept shouting. An old lady walked up to him and asked, "What did you do outside?"
    "What did I do! I am a civilian laborer and also a soldier." That made everyone laugh.

　　我是民夫也是战士
    鲁生
    这是翻身农民尚海泉谈的参战故事。
    三月清明节，河门口村乱嚷嚷，村长把政府的参战号召传达给村民后，翻身农民都抢着报名去参战。尚海泉刚病了三个月才好，身体还不强健，也要报名去参战。
    村长说：“海泉！你下次去吧！你的身体还不行！”
    海泉说：“不行！参战是给自己干，我身体不行多一人总比少一人强。”
    村长给他谈了一天也不成，终于允许他去参战。
    临走时在欢送会上，尚海泉举着拳头说：“为保卫咱们的翻身领袖毛主席，为保卫咱们的果实，我要报名去参战，这次我去，不立功就不回来。”
    两个月后，果然尚海泉在晋南参战立了功。
    消息传到村里，大家都纷纷的说：“老尚就有股楞劲，又胆大又敢干。”有的说：“这回选成了特等功臣，咱们河门口村人真光荣！”
    晋南战斗结束，尚海泉返回来，他一进村，村干部和群众就在他周围围成了一个圈，要求他谈参战故事。
    大家正吵成一团时，村长过来了，人群马上静下来。村长笑嘻嘻的走过来，把他的行李强拉到自己肩膀上，握住他的手说：“好海泉呀！当时我还不想让你去，走时病了三个月身体不强，回来吃得红光满面了，哈哈！前方生活好吧？”
    “可不！前方生活好，军队实在关心咱民夫。”村长看他在许多人中招呼不过来，忙说：“大家来吧，等他到家里坐下再谈故事。”
    他一回到家中，开水已预备好了两三碗。他一边喝水一边说：“我今天走得乏了，只能少说几个。”大家感到不管他说什么，前方的事情总是新鲜有趣的，谁也想听。
    “先说打稷山吧！”尚海泉开始说：
    “我是第一次参战的，一跟上军队，每天走路又多又快；走了两天，虽稷山城还有一百多里，上级下命令，要一股劲赶到。
    “我们抬着梯子走，走了一天一夜只吃了一顿饭，还是继续走；这时大家又乏又饿，我恐怕大家乏，就一股劲抬着梯子不调换，想让别人多换换多休息。又怕大家受饿，拿出我自己的干粮给大家吃。
    “走！走！走到腿酸时，才算走到了。这时听说离城很近，队伍正准备向城里打，我们就得到命令放下梯子。一放下就有一行队伍来抬梯；我想：这是怎么回事？我稍立了一下，看到我们抬梯的人都下去了，我就继续和队伍一齐抬梯。一个同志拦住我说：‘老乡：你快下去休息吧！马上要攻城了！’我说：‘不！同志！我也要去！’说着我就和他一齐抬上梯子前去了。
    “不一会，就看到前面的城墙了，忽然‘轰隆！轰隆！’响了两声炮，呵呀！可把我吓坏了！我当是顽军的炮打来了，谁知抬头一看，城墙上黑烟冒起，大炮声不断，原来是我们攻城开始了。我这时害怕了，可也不愿下来，就又硬着头皮抬着梯子向前走。
    “刚过一条土垅，还没走两步，梯子忽然象飞起来，跑的实在快，我被梯子带到城墙下，一个同志说：‘老乡！快帮助竖梯子！’我很害怕，赶快帮助竖好梯，只见同志们，满身挂着手榴弹，直往上爬，我这时又害怕起来了。”
    一个青年插嘴问他：“那你就下来了？”
    “没有！没有！我见到那满身手榴弹的队伍，一齐往城上拥，我又想：人家还往上上，我还能下？后来不知不觉就把住梯子往城上上。一上去，队伍都爬在城上打，前面一些装土的麻袋挡住了去路，一个队伍叫我说：‘来！同志！快使锹刨个洞！’他给了我个小锹，我就帮他刨洞，洞刨好一会，忽然轰隆一声又响了，这回几乎把我吓得跌到城墙下，起来又看那麻袋，都成了碎片片，队伍都喊着：杀呵！冲呀！捉活的！就跑进一串大楼院去。”
    “这时王干事也上来了，我就随他一齐到了城下。进到顽固县政府，我拾起一个小手枪，一篓纸烟，一件大衣，手枪给了王干事，纸烟分给大家吸了，我又把大衣给伤员盖上，咱自己啥也没要。”
    “说完了吧？”一个青年又问他。他说：“这才说完第一个，再说第二个吧！”
    他喝了几口水说：“第二个是眉阳战斗！”
    “眉阳战斗打得正厉害时，前面忽然传来口令：‘要速派三付担架到前面去抢救彩号。’班长问大家说：‘谁去？’我说我去，一下就有十来个人都愿去。临走时，队伍同志给我们说：‘到前面要利用地形，不敢乱跑，背彩号时要快。’
    “出去走了几十步，子弹吱吱的叫着，就象在头顶上飞，不由的我只低头。队伍同志说：‘不怕，子弹可高哩！’咱老是沉不住气，只是低着头跑。
    “又走了一角，炮弹子弹响的更厉害了，这时见到王同志早在那里，他低声说：‘老乡！都把担架放下，先上去背！’放下担架扭回头来一看，王干事早低着头向前跑了，我就紧跟上去，全身周围都是子弹呼呼响，我恨不得一头钻进土里去，把头低得离地只有一尺高，跑的全身出冷汗。
    “跑到一个土凹里，王干事说：‘赶快背，不管那一个，背上就走，路上要小心隐蔽！’我这时才看到躺着几个战士，我背起一个就走，他身上尽是血，我身上尽是汗，血、汗流在一齐，弄得我全身湿湿渌渌。
    “我真是性急，刚一出凹地，背着伤员一股劲跑，使的我上气接不住下气来，头晕眼黑胸脯痛。伤员同志说：‘老乡！你不敢一直跑，见到有土垅就停一停。’这时我才想起利用地形地物了，我跑一角，歇一歇，一直背到放担架的地方。
    “第二次去背时，我就学会了利用地形，没有使的那样厉害，就很顺利的背了下来。
    “四次上去时，枪声已打的不紧，王干事说：‘战斗已经结束了，俘虏了六百多敌人，得了十几挺美造重机枪，这里没有伤员了，来吧！跟我进村去！’
    “一走到街上，我看到一个顽固家伙在一条圪洞里一拐一拐的跑，手里还提着一条枪。我说那不是个顽固？说着我猛一下跑去，拦腰搂住把他按倒在地上，当那个家伙弯过头来时，我一枪托就打了他个脸朝下。手脚擅了擅就完了。又从他身上搜出一个表来。
    “战斗完全结束了，我又帮助王干事寻着烈士尸体，一同背到村外大庙上，又慢慢的埋在庙后，插起牌子。
    “这次下来，我很高兴，上级看到我的衣服上尽是血，就给我换了一身新衣服。”说着他用手摸着他的新衣服。
    一个青年又问他：“这是奖给你的吗？”
    “奖还在后面，现在先谈第三个运城战斗吧：
    “运城战斗打到第二天，火线上需要大门板，送大门板要走过危险地带，谁也不敢去。我说我去！王干事说：‘门板很大，你一个人不行吧？’我说背得动，说着我背上就走，在路上我时而停，时而跑，一直送到火线上，没有误了大家使用。
    “后来运城战斗结束了，部队马上要转移，我们还是抬着梯子走，走进离运城三里的一个村子，忽然村当中的拐弯地方，一道土墙妨碍住梯子转不过去。怎么办呀？运城敌人不断向这村开炮，又怕战斗部队撤下来走了，几百号人叫喊着：‘快走！快走！’‘前边为什么不走？’……
    “急得我到前边一看，一道两丈多高的土墙，挡着梯子转不了弯。那里也没路，只得从这里过，这才是‘没了干粮又丢了钱！’干急没办法。
    “抬梯的民夫叫喊，几个护梯的部队同志也跺脚，谁也没办法，我看了一看，忽然计上心头，我和前边抬梯的人说：‘来！’把梯子稍往高一顺，我就上去了！我一上到土墙上，很快就把土墙刨了一层，又跳到墙下，找出一把镢头来，把墙跟前刨了一道沟，又返到墙外。我说：‘我喊一二！大家一齐扛，就可把墙扛倒，’于是我喊：‘一——二’哗啦一声，土墙倒了，梯子才顺利的过去。
    “以后回到闻喜住，又是开表功会，评功会，贺功会，都说我出力不小，发给了我许多奖品。回来时，一眼望不透的队伍，排在村外欢送我们走，旅长还给我酌酒，献花。……”
    “真是光荣呀！真是光荣呀！”人们不断喊。一个老太太走到他跟前问：“那你在外面干的是甚事？”
    “干甚事！我是民夫也是战士。”说得人们都笑了。
