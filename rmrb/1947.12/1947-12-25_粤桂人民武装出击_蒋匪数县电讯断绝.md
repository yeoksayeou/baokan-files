Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 20th: According to Tianjin newspapers, the Guangdong-Guangxi People's Armed Forces have recently launched large-scale attacks, cutting off communication in several counties controlled by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. Communication in Peace, Lianping, and Wengyuan counties in northern Guangdong and the border area of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces has been disrupted since November 25th. Communication in Huang County and Yulin in southeastern Guangxi has also been cut off since November 26th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in both provinces are extremely panicked and have convened a "Pacification Conference" to discuss countermeasures. According to Chiang Kai-shek's acting naval commander in Shanghai on December 18th, there have recently been armed uprisings by people on the Guangdong coast and around the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province. Chiang Kai-shek's navy is frantically dealing with the situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 23rd: The active operations of the Guangdong People's Armed Forces have greatly hindered Chiang Kai-shek's conscription of soldiers and grain. According to newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, Huang Shitu, deputy commander of the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Military Control Zone, reported to the puppet provincial council that the conscription quota for Guangdong this year was 45,000 men, but only 26,989 men have been conscripted so far, with a shortfall of more than 18,000 men. Eighty percent of the shortfall is due to the activities of the People's Armed Forces. Huang Bingxun, director of the provincial grain bureau, also complained bitterly that in the past month, the People's Armed Forces have seized more than 120,000 piculs of grain in various parts of Guangdong. On November 25th alone, 80,000 piculs were seized. The Huang bandit had no choice but to adopt measures such as immediate requisition and transportation, or collection at discounted prices, or entrusting storage to "big landlords" (i.e., landlords and local bullies) with local defense forces. Furthermore, almost all the firearms of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Jixi County, southern Anhui Province, have been seized by the People's Armed Forces. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the area are forcibly searching the people for firearms under the pretext of borrowing them, and anyone who refuses to lend their firearms is accused of "collaborating with the bandits."

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 20th: The fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway is becoming increasingly intensified. According to reports from Donghai (Haizhou): Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops have suddenly implemented the "Five-Household Joint Responsibility System" in Xinpu, Donghai, and other places, where five households are held jointly responsible for the "crimes" of one household. Adults and children are required to obtain "National Identity Cards," and must apply for leave when going out. Failure to return on time is considered "collaboration with the Eighth Route Army." In addition, each bao (group of households) is ordered to establish a squad of "Self-Defense Forces," with all firearms, uniforms, and supplies to be borne by the bao. Under heavy burdens and dark rule, the citizens are unable to live and are fleeing to the liberated areas. The original 3,000 households in Dapu have now been reduced to more than 600 households.

　　粤桂人民武装出击 　 蒋匪数县电讯断绝
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据天津报纸透露：粤桂人民武装近大举出击，蒋匪数县电讯已告隔断。广东北部粤赣边和平、连平、翁原等县电讯，自上月廿五日开始不通，广西东南黄县郁林电讯，自上月廿六日亦告断绝。两省蒋匪当局恐慌异常，特为此召开两省“绥靖会议”，讨论应付办法。另据蒋匪海军代总司令本月十八日在沪透露，广东海面及浙省舟山群岛一带，最近时有水上民变武装活动，蒋匪海军正张惶应付中。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】广东人民武装之积极活动，已给蒋匪征兵征粮很大阻碍。据蒋区报纸载称：蒋匪广东军管区副司令黄世途在该省御用参议会作报告称：广东本年度征兵额为四万五千人，现仅征集二万六千九百八十九人，缺额一万八千余人，因人民武装活动而不能征集者，占百分之八十。该省田粮处长黄秉勋亦苦诉：近一月来，广东各地粮食为人民武装缴去者，在十二万石以上，仅十一月二十五日一天，即被缴获八万石。黄匪无可奈何，只有被迫采取即征即运、或折价征收、或交当地有自卫力量之“大户”（按即地主、恶霸）保管等办法。又蒋安徽南部绩溪县城乡蒋匪所有枪支，几被人民武装缴光，现该地蒋匪只有以借枪名义，强力向民间搜索，凡有枪不借者，均以“通匪”论罪。
    【新华社华东二十日电】陇海路东端蒋匪法西斯统治变本加厉。据东海（海州）讯：蒋匪顷在新浦、东海等地突施“五家连环保”，一家犯“法”五家连坐。大人小孩一律要领取“国民身份证”，出外时必须请假，逾期不返即以“通八路”论“罪”。又勒令每保成立一个班的“自卫队”，其枪支、军服、给养全部由保内负担。在繁重苛杂与黑暗统治下，市民无法生活，纷纷逃来解放区。原有三千余户之大浦，现已减至六百余户。
