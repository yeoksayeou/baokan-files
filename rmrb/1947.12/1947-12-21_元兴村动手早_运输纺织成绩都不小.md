　　[Report from Taiyue by our newspaper on the 18th] Yuanxing Village in Yangcheng County started its winter production early. The men have already earned a profit of over 1.7 million yuan from transportation, and the women have woven 280 bolts of cloth. After the autumn plowing was completed on November 11th, the entire village immediately engaged in winter production. The transportation team, led by hired poor peasants like Yang Fulai, departed on the 15th of last month and has already completed two transportation runs, earning a profit of 1,737,370 yuan. Among them, there are 23 targets of struggle who, under the control of the peasants, also participate in transportation labor. Women have woven 284 bolts and nine chi of cloth. The cooperative has prepared 1,000 jin of cotton to supply women for spinning and weaving. Now the entire village is making new plans. The 251 people participating in transportation plan to earn a profit of 5,230,000 yuan during the two months of winter production. The 413 women (including young girls) plan to spin and weave 1,334 bolts and five chi of cloth. Together, these two items can earn a profit of 8,698,400 yuan, averaging an income of 12,800 yuan per person, so that they will not need to eat the grain harvested this year during these two months of winter and can lay the foundation for next year's spring plowing. The village cadres are determined to lead the entire village to realize this plan.
