    Why Winter Production Can't Get Off the Ground?
    Mainly Because of Relaxed Leadership
    Changzhi Shexian District Cadres Conduct Self-Criticism
    [This newspaper's Taihang, 12th dispatch] The Shexian Seventh District examined winter production and discovered that the reason it cannot get off the ground is mainly because cadres are complacent, work is not thorough, understanding of problems is superficial, and they have become numb. Leading comrades have been buried in land reform investigation, neglecting the leadership of winter production, causing the movement to be delayed and become scattered and spontaneous. After the harvest ended, production in the district showed a decline and spontaneity. The leadership did not pay attention to it, but was buried in land reform investigation. It was not until the district cadre meeting on the 3rd of this month to study winter production that it was discovered that the reason why winter production had not started was: there was a general complacency, numbness, and slackness among the district cadres, insufficient understanding of the disaster, and neglect of the leadership of winter production. Some cadres, although they were also leading winter production, only superficially made general calculations, went to the village cadres and middle peasants to listen to the reflection of "there is nothing to do, nothing is right," and took it as a comprehensive situation, thinking that the masses' lives were not difficult, so they did not lead and let it drift. They did not go deep into the poor and hired to understand their lives and production needs, and rely on them as the backbone, as the foundation for organizing and promoting production, causing winter production to not yet form a widespread movement. For example, Shen Zhidong said in his self-criticism: "This year, I thought that our district's production was very good, and there were only six disaster villages in the whole district, and the masses would not have much difficulty surviving the famine." Wang Jiucheng said: "I went to Xihoujun to calculate the harvest, and calculated that the masses were only short of two months of food per person on average. I thought this gap was not big, and the masses were cold in the winter and couldn't find a way out. Let's work hard next spring!" In addition, some cadres also believed that "we might go south at any time," and showed a "doing the job for the day" attitude towards production leadership, and their work could not be deepened for a long time. After deep reflection and self-criticism, everyone began to realize that: the reason why winter production has not started is mainly a cadre problem, not how serious the masses' "winter leisure" thoughts are. At the meeting, everyone also studied many instructions on winter production in the Xinhua Daily, and combined with the actual situation of the district, made detailed discussions. Finally, everyone unanimously proposed to overcome complacency, resolutely go deep into the poor and hired, and quickly launch the winter production movement.
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] A joint meeting of district secretaries and district heads was held on the 30th of last month to examine the reasons why the winter production movement had not been launched. After three days of discussion, the goals of winter production were re-clarified. It has been a whole month since the Changzhi District Secretary and District Head Joint Meeting on October 30th deployed winter production, and the movement has still not been widely launched. The main reason is that there is a mechanical waiting mentality from top to bottom. Cadres do not have enough understanding of winter production and regard it as a transitional work, hindering the development of the movement. The fourth district secretary said: "District and village cadres regard winter production as a way to fill gaps, not with a long-term perspective, thinking that winter production is not the main thing, and only arranged work for one month." The third district secretary said: "I think production is just pocket money." The second district secretary believed that textile was the main thing, and investigating burdens was the main thing, regarding production as a transitional work. The first district secretary said: "When cadres in our district were checking autumn storage, they said they were relying on the poor and hired as the backbone, but when they went down, they knocked out all the middle peasant cadres, thinking that 'middle peasants and poor hired are not naturally a family,' forming the isolation of the poor and hired, which will also affect production." After everyone's research, the future policy for launching winter production was determined: (1) Continue production, get rich and prosper, get richer and richer, focusing on textile, coal and iron industries, and carry out the winter manure accumulation movement. First, cadres must clear their minds, clarify their direction, put down their waiting mentality, and fully and comprehensively organize the masses for winter production. The guiding ideology must clearly overcome complacency and numbness, and have a good understanding of the masses' poor harvests and deficits. At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that textile is the key, and carry out various sideline productions such as transportation and coal and iron industries. Before the New Year, carry out a hundred-liang flower movement for textile, and male full laborers should strive to earn one stone of rice, accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, lay the foundation for production next spring, break the old habits of the masses, and accumulate eighty loads of fertilizer per mu this winter. In short, carry out a comprehensive fertilizer accumulation movement, do whatever you can do, and carry out a mass sideline production movement. (2) Break ideological obstacles, fully and comprehensively organize, and implement equal pay for equal work and profit sharing. Mobilize the poor and hired from a positive perspective, enlighten class consciousness, and take action to promote middle peasants. For example, the leadership of Xinyi Village proposed: "What should we do if we don't produce in winter? How did we live in the past when we didn't produce in winter?" Overcoming the masses' complacency and numbness, they first mobilized the poor and hired to take the lead in uniting the middle peasants, and the movement quickly unfolded.

    冬季生产为啥搞不起来？
    主要因为放松领导
    长治涉县区干进行自我检讨
    【本报太行十二日电】涉县七区检查冬季生产，发现搞不起来的原因，主要是干部自满、工作不深入、了解问题浮浅、麻痹了自己，领导同志埋头于土改考察，忽略了领导冬季生产，致使运动迟迟未进，形成散乱自流。该区在收耕结束后，生产即表现消沉自流，有的互助组甚至散伙，领导上亦未重视，只是埋头于土改考察。直至本月三日召开区干会研究冬季生产时，才发现冬季生产所以未搞起的原因：是区干部中普遍存在着自满、麻痹、松懈思想，对于灾荒认识不足，而忽视了对冬季生产的领导，有些干部虽也在领导冬季生产，但也只是浮浅的作了一般的计算，走到村干部、中农跟前听听“没啥搞，搞啥也不对”的反映，就当成全面情况，以为群众生活不困难，便不去领导，听其自流；并未深入贫雇了解他们的生活及生产要求，依靠他们为骨干，作为组织与推动生产的基础，致使冬季生产至今尚未形成普遍运动。如申之栋在检讨时说：“今年一年来认为咱区生产很好，全区只有六个灾村，群众渡荒是不会有甚困难的”。王九成说：“我到西后峻计算年成，计算群众每人平均只差两个月粮食，我认为这窟窿不大，冬天群众害冷又找不到门路，明春加油干吧！”另外，也有些干部认为“不定什么时候就南下呀”，对生产领导表现“当一日和尚撞一日钟”的态度，工作长时深入不下去。经过深刻的反省检讨，大家始认识到：冬季生产未搞起来，主要是干部问题，并非群众的“冬闲”思想如何如何的严重。在会上，大家又学习了新华日报上的许多关于冬季生产指示，并结合该区实际情况，作了详尽的讨论。最后大家一致提出要克服自满情绪，坚决深入贫雇，把冬季生产运动迅速的开展起来。
    【本报长治讯】上月卅日召开区书、区长联席会议，检查冬季生产运动没有开展的原因，经过了三天讨论，重新明确了冬季生产的目标。长治自十月卅日区书、区长联席会布置了冬季生产，到现在整整一个月时间，运动仍然没有普遍的开展起来，主要原因是自上而下的存在着机械等待思想，干部对冬季生产认识不足，当成过渡工作，阻碍着运动开展。四区分书说：“区村干部都把冬季生产当成补空子，不往长期着眼，认为冬季生产不是主要，布置工作只布置了一个月。”三区分书说：“我认为生产是个零花。”二区分书认为纺织为主，查负担为主，把生产当成了过渡工作。一区分书说：“我区干部在检查秋屯时，说是依贫雇为骨干，下去把中农干部一齐拨落光，认为‘中农和贫雇天生就不是一家人’，形成了贫雇孤立，这也会影响生产。”经过大家研究，确定了今后开展冬季生产方针：（一）继续生产，发家致富，富了再富，以纺织煤铁业为主，开展冬季积肥运动。首先干部清理头脑，明确方向，放下等待思想，全力全面组织群众冬季生产。领导思想必须明确克服自满麻痹，很好认识群众歉收亏空，同时，要认识纺织为关键，开展运输、煤铁业等各种副业生产，在年前开展纺织百两花运动，男全劳力要争取赚到一石米，大量积肥，为明春打下生产基础，打破群众旧习惯，每亩今冬要积肥八十担。总之，开展全面积肥运动，做到能干啥就干啥，并开展群众性的副业生产运动。（二）打破思想障碍，全力全面组织起来，贯彻等价分红。从积极方面发动贫雇，启发阶级自觉，行动起来推动中农。如信义村领导上提出：“冬天不生产怎么办？过去冬天不生产过的怎样？”克服了群众自满麻痹思想，首先发动贫雇，带头来团结中农，运动很快展开。（汉清、来成、清河）
