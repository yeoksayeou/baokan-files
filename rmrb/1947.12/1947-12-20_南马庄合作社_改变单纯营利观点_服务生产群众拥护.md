    Nanmazhuang Cooperative
    Changes its Purely Profit-Oriented View
    Serves Production, and Gains Mass Support
    [This report from Lucheng] The Nanmazhuang Cooperative in the Third District of Lucheng, with its unclear direction and exclusive focus on profit, was disconnected from the production needs of the masses. Recently, after reorganization and leadership reform, it broke away from its old profit-seeking mindset and organized the masses for winter production. The cooperative allocated some funds to support poor laborers in engaging in production to fill gaps. The policy is to allow the masses to earn more, while the village cooperative earns less or even nothing. It also prioritized lending funds to poor laborers and households without draft animals, with precise planning, organized by groups, led by cadres, and divided into three routes for transportation. For households willing to earn transport fees, the village cooperative purchased a batch of grain and coal in Xiangyuan, paying a transport fee of 10 yuan per jin. For example, Guo Youcai earned over 2,800 yuan a day transporting coal. For households with labor and capital, the village cooperative purchased the transported coal and grain with cash. For households with labor but no capital, the village cooperative provided loans for transportation. In addition, poor elderly men were organized to cut white grass, paying 10 yuan per jin, which the village cooperative purchased with cash. In the textile industry, the cooperative purchased cotton and promoted finished products. For poor women without cotton, the village cooperative provided loans as a fund. If they wished to sell the spun thread, the village cooperative purchased it at market price. The masses reflected, "This kind of cooperative is truly thinking of the masses!"
