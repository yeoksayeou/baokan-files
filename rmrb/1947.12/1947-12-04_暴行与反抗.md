Atrocities and Resistance

    How the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Treat Us
    When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invaded the Daxiaowangzhuang area of central Shandong in July, they began setting fire to houses along each village. Smoke filled the air within a radius of more than 20 li, and more than 3,000 houses were reduced to ashes. Elderly people who could not bear it went down the mountain to put out the fire, but were killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Old women in the village who had not fled, took the risk to rescue materials from the houses and were also beaten severely, or pushed into the flames. Aunt Li of Guogou Village rushed into a house engulfed in flames to grab a package of cotton, but it was snatched from her hands by the brutal Chiang Kai-shek bandits and thrown into the flames. When she rushed into the house again, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits hung up the small door until her hair was burned off and she was unconscious before she was dragged out by her old mother. After the houses in each village burned, the inhuman bandits were still not satisfied, collecting all the wooden utensils and food and clothing outside the houses and throwing them into the fire. At the same time, they dug holes all over the mountains and fields, overturned mountain caves, robbed the people of their wealth, and captured more than 400 women, forcing them to take apart their hair, strip off their clothes, and drive them to the Catholic Church in Wangzhuang to be raped at will. Because the people in the area were displaced and had no food or clothing, half of them had fallen ill with typhoid fever after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits withdrew.

  　The Communist Party Has Guts
    When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits surrounded Dafuzhuang in Zhangqiu, Licheng, and Xin counties, they drove all the masses in the village to an open space, tortured them severely, and forced them to reveal the names of the village cadres. All the masses gritted their teeth and endured the pain, and no one confessed. At this time, Han, the 50-year-old chairman of the Farmers' Association, could not bear the suffering of all the elders in the village, and stepped forward, shouting sharply: "I am the chairman of the Farmers' Association, come to me if you have anything." The bandits said: "Good, you really have guts, why do you want to be the chairman of the Farmers' Association?" Han replied: "I should be the chairman of the Farmers' Association for the sake of the poor to turn over." The bandits asked while beating: "Why do you want to lead the struggle?" Han scolded: "The struggle is against the bad seeds, the poor trust me, I should lead the struggle." In the end, Han, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, died generously, shouting: "The Communist Party has guts."

    Sneaking Past Enemy Sentries to Rescue the Wounded
    On September 14, during a blocking battle in a village in Shouguang and Linhu District, the soldier Zhou Dianyuan was injured in the head and was not rescued in time. The enemy occupied the village for three days. Sui Xingzhi and Zhang Shixuan, two liberated peasants, searched for Zhou Dianyuan in the bean fields at night, but could not find him for a long time. They pretended to cut grass and passed through the enemy's sentry posts, and later found him in the sorghum field. They covered Zhou with straw, went home to boil a pot of boiling water, and secretly sent him two white steamed buns. At night, they secretly got a stretcher, carried the wounded to the lake, found a small boat, and safely escorted him to the rear hospital.

    "Death for Death"
    Since Chiang Kai-shek's "Returning Home Corps" invaded Laiyang, Pingdu and other counties in early September, they began a bloody massacre of the masses. More than 30 people were beaten to death in Zhougezhuang, Qujia and other villages in Pingnan County alone. More than 20 refugees who escaped from Changyi South County to Bajiazhai were shot into the water and drowned by Chiang Kai-shek bandits with machine guns. They also organized local tyrants and landlords to settle accounts and brutally kill liberated masses. Eighteen village cadres were put into a well in Longjialan, Laiyang Southwest County. This kind of atrocity by Chiang Kai-shek's "Returning Home Corps" aroused great anger among the liberated masses. They organized sparrow groups and road demolition teams to fight the enemy. When the landlord of Xiagezhuang settled accounts with the masses, the masses were furious and shouted in unison: "Today, it's either you or me, we would rather fight to the death than starve to death." They picked up shovels and hoes and beat the landlord to death.

    Answering the Enemy's Slaughter with Joining the Army
    More than a dozen village cadres and members of the masses were killed near Yishou Duancun, and even the martyrs' tombs were destroyed. The masses said angrily: "We can't protect the living, and we can't protect the dead either." Therefore, a campaign to join the army to avenge was launched. Within ten days, more than 400 people in the county joined the army. On October 1, 474 strong young men in Xin Dian District, Guangrao, poured into the main force in one day. 236 people in Maying District, Zhanhua County, also joined the army. Huimin and other counties also launched campaigns to join the army to avenge. (Xinhua News Agency, 19th)

　　暴行与反抗
    蒋匪怎样对待我们
    蒋匪于七月间侵入鲁中大小王庄地带时，开始沿各村将房屋点燃，方圆廿余里内烟雾漫天，三千余间房子化为灰烬。老年人不忍，纷纷下山救火，均遭蒋匪杀害，村中未逃难的老妪，冒险抢救屋中物资时亦遭受毒打，或推入火焰中。郭沟村李大嫂冲进燃起烈火的屋中抢出一包棉花，但被蒋匪凶暴的从她手中夺去，抛入火焰中，当她再冲进屋中，蒋匪却把小门挂上，直至头发被烧光不省人事时，始被其老母拖出。各村房屋燃烧后，无人性的匪徒们仍不甘心，搜集房外的一切木器、衣食抛入火中，同时又满山遍野挖地穴，翻山洞，抢劫人民的财富，并捕捉四百余妇女，迫令她们拆散头发，剥光衣服，赶往王庄天主教堂内任意奸污。该地人民因流离失散，衣食无着，待蒋匪撤走后，已半数染伤寒症而病倒。
  　共产党是有种的
    蒋匪包围了章（邱）历（城）县（新县）大夫庄时，将全庄群众驱至空场，极刑拷打，迫问村干姓名，全体群众咬牙忍痛，无一供认，此时年已五十的韩农会长，不忍全村父老受苦，挺身而出，厉声大喊：“我是农会长，有事找我”。匪徒们说：“好，你真有种，为什么要当农会长？”韩答：“为了穷爷们翻身，我就应该当农会长”。匪徒又边打边问：“你为什么要领导斗争”？韩大骂说：“斗是斗的坏种，穷爷们信任我，我就应该领导斗争”，最后，韩农会长慷慨就义，大喊：“共产党是有种的”。
    混过敌哨救伤员
    九月十四日解放军在寿光、临湖区某村阻击战中，战士周殿元脑部受伤，未及救出，敌盘踞该村三日，翻身农民隋兴之、张士选二人于黑夜在豆地寻找周殿元，久未找到，他俩即装着割草，通过敌人岗哨，后在高梁地里找着了。即用禾秸把周盖起来，回家烧一壶开水，拿两个白面饼偷送给他。夜间秘密弄到一付担架，把伤员抬到湖边，找到小船，安全护送到后方医院。
    以“打死”对“打死”
    自蒋记“还乡团”于九月初侵入莱阳、平度等县以后，即对群众开始了血腥屠杀，仅在平（度）南县周戈庄、曲家等村即被打死三十余名，从昌（邑）南县逃到八家寨的难民有二十多个被蒋匪用机枪打到水中淹死。并组织恶霸地主倒算残杀翻身群众，莱（阳）西南县龙家兰一个井内装了十八个村干部。蒋匪“还乡团”此种暴行激起翻身群众极大愤怒。组织麻雀组，破路队与敌周旋。夏格庄的地主向群众倒算时，群众大怒，齐喊：“今天有你没有我，能拼死不能饿死”，拿起锹和镢将地主打死。
    以参军回答敌人的残杀
    益寿段村附近十余村干群众被杀了，连烈士墓也破坏了。群众愤怒说：“生的不能保，死的也不能保”，于是掀起参军复仇运动，十天内，全县即有四百余人参军，广饶辛店区十月一号一天内就有四百七十四名壮丁拥入主力。沾化县马营区也有二百三十六人参军。惠民等县也纷纷展开了参军复仇运动。（新华社十九日电）
