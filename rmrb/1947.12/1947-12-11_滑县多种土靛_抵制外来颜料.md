    Hua County Widely Plants Local Indigo
    Resisting Foreign Pigments
    [Reported by this newspaper] Before the war, farmers in the fourth district of Hua County widely planted local indigo, but due to the invasion of foreign indigo and the exploitation of the feudal economy, the masses gradually reduced planting. Since last year, the government has called for large-scale planting of local indigo to resist foreign pigments, and the masses in most villages in the fourth district have successively responded to planting local indigo. This year, due to erratic rainfall, the harvest was halved compared to previous years. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 2,000 mu of spring indigo were planted in the district, with an average yield of 30 jin per mu, totaling 60,000 jin. At a market price of 1,400 yuan per jin, each mu yielded 42,000 yuan, and the entire district yielded 84 million yuan. With each dou of sorghum priced at 1,000 yuan, the price of indigo per mu could buy 4.2 dou of sorghum. This year, each mu of sorghum could yield 4 dou, meaning the indigo yield of each mu equals the harvest of 10 mu of sorghum. Zhang Wenyin, of Huangyin Village in the fourth district of Puyang, planted 5 mu of wheat stubble indigo and sold it for a total of 180,000 yuan. After deducting all expenses of 35,600 yuan, the actual profit was 144,440 yuan, with a profit of 28,888 yuan per mu. His corn yielded a maximum of 1.3 shi per mu, which at a market price of 1,800 yuan per dou, totaled 23,400 yuan, with a net profit of less than 20,000 yuan after deducting expenses. Comparing the two, one mu of wheat stubble indigo yields about 9,000 yuan more profit than one mu of corn, which can buy 5 dou of sorghum. Compared with ordinary corn, the profit from planting indigo, one mu of wheat stubble indigo, is roughly equivalent to two mu of corn. Each jin of local indigo can dye 1.5 zhang of black and blue cloth. The harvest of indigo in the fourth district of Hua County can dye about 900,000 chi of cloth, which at a dyeing price of 200 yuan per chi, totals 180 million yuan. Without this local indigo, 30,000 jin of foreign pigment would be needed, which at a market price of 8,000 yuan per jin, would cost 240 million yuan. Based on the above situation, if the rainfall is favorable this year, the thousand mu of local indigo in the fourth district of Hua County can resist 30,000 jin of foreign pigment. This planting of indigo not only resists the invasion of Chiang and American pigments, reduces the outflow of our money, but also increases income equivalent to 18,000 mu of sorghum, totaling 7,200 shi of sorghum.

    滑县多种土靛
    抵制外来颜料
    【本报讯】战前滑县四区农民多种土靛，因洋靛的侵入及封建经济的剥削，群众种植渐次减少。自去年政府号召大量种植土靛，抵制外来颜料以来，四区大部分村庄的群众，先后响应种植土靛。今年因雨水失调，较往年收获减半，据不完全统计，该区种春靛共二千亩，每亩平均打靛三十斤，共计收六万斤，每斤以市价一千四百元计，每亩获洋四万二千元，全区获洋八千四百万元；每斗高粱以市价一千元计，每亩靛价可买高粱四石二斗，今年每亩高粱可打四斗，计每亩靛顶高粱十亩的收获。濮阳四区黄印村张文印种麦茬靛五亩，共卖洋十八万元，除去一切开支三万五千六百元外，实得利十四万四千四百四十元，每亩获利二万八千八百八十八元。他的玉茭每亩最多打一石三斗，每斗以市价一千八百元计，共得洋二万三千四百元，除去开支净利不到二万元。两相比较，一亩麦茬靛比一亩玉茭多得利约九千元以上，可买高粱五斗，如与普通玉茭比较，种靛的利，一亩麦茬靛约顶玉茭二亩。每斤土靛可染黑蓝布一丈五尺，滑县四区靛的收获共可染布约九十万尺，每尺布染价以二百元计，共计洋一万八千万元。如无此土靛，即需外来颜料三万斤，每斤以市价八千元计，共需支付二十四万万元。按以上情况看，如今年雨水调和，滑县四区千亩土靛，可抵制外来颜料三万斤。这一种靛不仅抵制了蒋美颜料的侵入，减少我金钱之外溢，且增加了相当于一万八千亩高粱的收入，共合高粱七千二百石。（雅齐）
