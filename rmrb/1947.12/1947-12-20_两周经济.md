    I. Market Conditions and Prices:
    In the past half-month, prices in the border areas have generally been stable, but the prices of salt and imported paper have been high due to limited supply. Native produce and mountain goods are also becoming more expensive quickly, as merchants, anticipating the opening of sales channels after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, are increasingly trying to acquire them. In addition, prices in southern Shanxi rose sharply for a time due to enemy incursions across the river. Details are as follows:
    Grain
    In the past half-month, grain prices in our region have generally been stable, similar to the previous two weeks. However, at the end of the month in southern Shanxi, due to enemy incursions across the river, grain prices nearly doubled: in Yi Shi, wheat rose from 950 yuan per market dou to 1600 yuan on November 24th, and corn rose from 550 yuan to 1000 yuan; in Jishan, wheat rose from 900 yuan per market dou to 1800 yuan on November 25th, and corn rose from 500 yuan to 1000 yuan. In northern Yue, prices were high due to the enemy's (from Pingyao and Jiexiu) occasional grain looting: in Guo Dao on November 20th, millet was 1200 yuan per market dou, and wheat was 1800 yuan, both rising by 20% compared to the end of the previous week. In Hechuan, at the same time, millet was 1000 yuan per market dou, and wheat was 1400 yuan, with millet rising by 42% and wheat by 17%. Prices were stable in various parts of Taihang: in Changzhi, millet was 1650 yuan per market dou in the last ten days of the month, wheat was 2100 yuan, and corn was 800 yuan, all stable. In Yangyi, millet was 125 yuan per market jin in the past half-month, a decrease of 12%; wheat was 165 yuan, stable; corn was 70 yuan, a decrease of 20%. In Gaoyi, millet was 150 yuan per jin in the last ten days of the month, stable; wheat was 190 yuan, a strong increase of 20%. In Xingtai, millet was 155 yuan, a decrease of 7-8%, wheat was 172 yuan, stable; corn was 81 yuan, a decrease of 19%. In Handan, prices for millet and miscellaneous grains were stable in the past half-month, with a slight increase in wheat: millet was 140 yuan per jin, corn was 75 yuan, red sorghum was 70 yuan, and wheat was 170 yuan, an increase of 13%. Prices were stable in various parts of southern Hebei: in Linqing, millet was 136 yuan per jin in the last ten days of the month, stable; wheat was 143 yuan, stable; corn was 85 yuan, a decrease of slightly over 6%. In Nangong, millet was 150 yuan per jin, stable; wheat was 170 yuan, an increase of 6%. In Hengshui, grain prices were stable in the past half-month, with millet at 116 yuan per jin, wheat at 137 yuan, and red sorghum at 92 yuan. In Puyang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, grain prices were stable, with wheat at 3800 yuan per dou (31 jin) and red sorghum at 1650 yuan in the last ten days of the month. According to the rise and fall of grain prices in various places, millet and miscellaneous grains were stable, and wheat prices were high because wheat from various cities along the Pinghan Railway flowed north after the liberation of Shijiazhuang. Grain prices in the neighboring friendly areas around the border area have been stable and declining in the past half-month: in Dezhou, from November 15th to 27th, millet was 75 yuan per jin, wheat was 105 yuan, and red sorghum was 58 yuan, with wheat decreasing by about 20%, millet decreasing by 12%, and miscellaneous grains stable compared to the previous two weeks. In central Hebei, grain prices have fallen since the liberation of Shijiazhuang. In Xinji in the middle ten days of the month, millet was 22,000 yuan per market dou, wheat was 21,500 yuan, and red sorghum was 10,500 yuan, with millet and wheat prices similar to the first ten days of the month, and miscellaneous grains falling by about 10%. In Bozhen on the 25th, millet was 17,000 yuan per market dou, wheat was 18,000 yuan, and corn was 8,280 yuan, with millet falling by 35%, wheat rising by 20%, and corn falling by about 20% compared to the 15th. Grain prices in the Chiang-controlled areas continued to soar. In Tianjin, from November 18th to 29th, millet rose from 4,400 yuan per jin to 6,000 yuan, with millet rising by over 50%, rice rising by 32%, white wheat rising by 66%, and flour rising by over 50% compared to the 15th.
    Cotton
    Cotton prices were generally stable, but at the end of the month, prices in the Puyang area of the eastern front rose rapidly due to smooth sales to the south. In the western front, in the southern Shanxi area, due to enemy incursions across the river, the value of the currency was unstable, and merchants hoarding goods caused prices to rise sharply. Compared with half a month ago: in Puyang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the price was around 800 yuan per jin before the 19th, and then it was raised to 930 yuan to 850 yuan due to rapid sales to the south, an increase of about 12-13%. In Linqing, southern Hebei, it was 750 yuan, stable; in Nangong, it was 750 yuan, stable; in Hengshui, it was 850 yuan, stable; in Xiazhen, it was 680 yuan, a decrease of 3-4%; in Handan on the 25th, it was 760 yuan, and then it fell back to 730 yuan on the 30th, the same price as at the end of the week. In Taihang Gaoyi, it was 660 yuan, stable; in Xingtai, it was 730-700 yuan, stable; in Yangyi, it was 750 yuan, stable; in Changzhi, it was 730-750 yuan, stable; in Taiyue Jiyuan, it was 800-950 yuan, stable; in northern Yue Guo Dao, it was 840 yuan, an increase of 15%; in Jincheng, it was 800 yuan, stable; in southern Shanxi Yi Shi on the 25th, it was 1000 yuan, a doubling; in Jishan, it was 900 yuan, an increase of 63%. Cotton prices in neighboring liberated areas have fallen: in Dezhou, Bohai, the price fell from 750 yuan to 650 yuan after the 15th, a decrease of over 15%. Cotton prices in central Hebei fell sharply. In Bozhen on the 25th, the price fell from 11,000 yuan on the 10th to 8,500 yuan, and then to 7,000 yuan, a decrease of 57% compared to the first half of the month. Yarn and cloth prices in the Chiang-controlled areas continued to soar. In Jinan, cotton prices temporarily stabilized in the middle ten days of the month due to tightening of currency, but by the last ten days of the month, it had risen to 3.6 million yuan. In Shanghai, cotton (per dan) rose by 1 million yuan from November 11th to 25th.
    Homespun Cloth
    In the past half-month, the cloth market in our area: was stable everywhere except in southern Shanxi, where rising cotton and grain prices influenced its increase. Public absorption on the eastern front slowed at the end of the month. Comparing cloth prices in various places with half a month ago: Puyang, 320 yuan for good cloth, 260 yuan for second-rate cloth, stable; Linqing fell from 380 yuan (7 chi per yard) to 350 yuan in the past half-month, a decrease of 7-8%. Nangong 300 yuan, stable; Hengshui 340 yuan, stable; Guangping 350 yuan, stable; Handan 320 yuan for good cloth, 260 yuan for second-rate cloth (all of the above are in double market chi). In Taihang Gaoyi, 120-130 yuan per square chi; in Xingtai, 135 yuan per square chi; the above are all stable. In Yangyi, 2150 yuan per market jin, stable; in Changzhi, 280 yuan per 16-yard chi, stable. In Taiyue Jiyuan, 5500 yuan per bolt (40 square chi), stable; in northern Yue Guo Dao, 200 yuan per market chi, an increase of 25%; in Hechuan, 180 yuan per market chi, an increase of 12%. Prices rose sharply in southern Shanxi: in Yi Shi, the price rose from 150 yuan to 300 yuan per market chi, a doubling; in other counties, the price rose by about 40-50% in general. Winter spinning is currently underway, and cloth prices are expected to remain stable.
    Salt
    In the past half-month, the price of sea salt has risen due to reduced supplies caused by the transportation of public grain on the eastern front. The price of Lu salt rose at the end of the month due to enemy incursions across the river. Generally stable in Hebei-Shandong-Henan: Puyang 250 yuan per jin, the same as the previous period. In Linqing, southern Hebei, the price rose from 190 yuan to 200-210 yuan by the end of the month, an increase of slightly over 10%. Hengshui 180 yuan, Nangong 250 yuan, an increase of 20%. Handan sea salt 240 yuan, general salt 220 yuan, the same as the previous period. In Taihang Gaoyi, sea salt once reached 400 yuan, but has now returned to 330 yuan. Niter also rose from 100 yuan to 125 yuan. Xingtai 288 yuan, the price fell slightly to 266 yuan at the end of the month due to smoother supplies of Bohai salt. In the Jinzhong area, salt was scarce and expensive. Pindang 300 yuan in the last ten days of the month, Yangyi 250 yuan, stable, Changzhi sea salt 280 yuan, Lu salt 250 yuan, all stable. Salt was scarce in northern Henan, and the price was 360 yuan in Bo Bi in the last ten days of the month. In Taiyue Jiyuan, Lu salt was 250 yuan, stable. The general price in southern Shanxi was 60-70 yuan, an increase of about 10% compared to the previous period. In the neighboring area of Dezhou, the price fell from 110 yuan to 95 yuan per jin after the 15th, a decrease of about 15%. In Bozhen and Xiaofan, central Hebei, most of the Bohai salt was concentrated here, and the price was declining, at 1100 yuan per jin of border currency, a decrease of 7-8%.
    Foreign Goods
    In the past half-month, other goods were generally stable except for paper, which remained expensive. In Puyang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, large sheet paper reached 93,000 yuan in Nanfeng and the middle ten days of the month. It also reached 85,000 yuan in Puyang on the 23rd, but has now fallen back slightly to 84,000 yuan per ream. In Linqing, southern Hebei, pink paper was 93,000-94,000 yuan, an increase of 4.4%. Other goods were stable: Nanjing matches 67,000 yuan, Qianxin fast indigo 195,000 yuan, black electric powder 35,000 yuan.

Prices in Tianjin in the Chiang-controlled area on the 15th: local newspaper 910,000 yuan, RB vulcanized blue 1.5 million yuan, Mobil oil 3.95 million yuan on the 30th, an increase of 296% compared to the 15th. German meta-cyanine essence 7 million yuan, an increase of 20%.
    Local Produce and Mountain Goods
    Mountain goods are still active in various places. In Taihang Bo Bi, yellow silk exports were smooth in the last ten days of the month, rising from 6,500 yuan to 7,000 yuan per jin. In Taiyue, yellow silk exports from Yumenkou were smooth, and prices also rose. In Jincheng on the 30th, each dan (4 jin) was 30,000 yuan, and in Gaoping 34,000 yuan. Hemp bark was also selling quickly. In Changzhi, the price rose to 460 yuan per jin in the last ten days of the month, and in Xingtai it rose to 650-640 yuan. Sichuan hemp has reached 700 yuan. Sichuan pepper and peach kernels are also selling quickly; in Shexian in the last ten days of the month, Sichuan pepper rose from 190 yuan to 210 yuan, peach kernels rose from 360 yuan to 380 yuan, Sichuan pepper in Xingtai rose from 250 yuan to 280 yuan, peach kernels rose from 370 yuan to 440 yuan, chestnuts rose from 200 yuan to 210 yuan, and daylilies rose from 280 yuan to 300 yuan.

Market conditions in Tianjin in the middle ten days of the month: peach kernels 2.5 million yuan per hundred jin, walnuts 1.3 million yuan, white melon seeds 1.22 million yuan, red dates 90,000 yuan, all goods were selling quickly and prices were high. (Note: Enemy-controlled areas are calculated in Chiang currency, Bohai is calculated in Northern currency, and central Hebei is calculated in border currency).
    II. Import and Export Trade:
    In the past half-month, import and export trade in the border area has been active: in Linqing and Hengshui on the eastern front, the types of export goods have increased, with Sichuan pepper, peach kernels, black dates, and sesame as the main items, followed by cotton. It is estimated that the total value of mountain goods exported from Linqing in one week was over 1 billion (Chiang currency), and the main import items were still matches and sugar. On the western front, in Taiyue Pingyao port, hemp bark exports declined in the last ten days of the month, while oil products became more active. In Yumenkou, southern Shanxi, yellow silk and cotton exports were fast, and yellow silk could be sold for 800,000 Chiang currency per jin west of the Yellow River. In Taihang Bo Bi, yellow silk exports were still smooth in the last ten days of the month, and iron goods could also be exported sporadically. Imports included matches, sugar, medicines, ink, paper, and foreign thread. Barter trade was still the main form of transaction. On the northern Henan front, new ports such as Xiwo and Changquan were opened in the past half-month under the political offensive of our army and people, and yellow silk, iron goods, Sichuan pepper, oak shells, etc. could be exported sporadically. Sugar and pigments were imported.
    Financial Situation
    In the past two weeks, the impact of limiting cotton exports in southern Hebei on exchange rate fluctuations has become a thing of the past. The rise of gold, silver, and commodity prices in the Chiang-controlled areas has resumed. The smooth export of our local produce and mountain goods and the normal supply and demand of foreign exchange have caused exchange rates to generally fall back. On November 30th, the exchange rate between Jinan and Linqing had fallen to 23.2 yuan to 1, with an average daily foreign exchange transaction volume of around 500 million and a balance of 500 million to 1 billion. During the same period, the exchange rate between Jinan and Nangong was 25 yuan to 1, and the exchange rate between Tianjin and Hengshui was 23.8 yuan to 1. In order to overcome the manipulation and speculation of the foreign exchange market by bill brokers and to strictly rectify the anti-enemy struggle front, Linqing also instructed all bill shops to change their business in mid-November and reorganized the foreign exchange exchange to implement centralized transactions. In Taihang Gaoyi, after our liberation of Shijiazhuang, the listed price of Chiang currency has fallen to 100 yuan to 1. At the end of November, Huixian and Anyang were both 25 yuan to 1, and Taigu and Pindang fell to 50 yuan to 1, and Qinyang was 30 to 40 yuan to 1. At the end of November, Taiyue Pingyao also fell to 40 yuan to 1. Although the currency value in the new districts of southern Shanxi once fluctuated due to the large amount of cotton exports in recent times, the large inflow of Chiang currency, and the impact of the military situation in Yuncheng, by the end of the month, the Chiang currency exchange rate in counties such as Fengnan, Jihe, and Ronghe had still fallen back to between 15 and 20 yuan to 1. The Chiang currency in Hebei-Shandong-Henan also continued to fall. In counties south of the Yellow River such as Heze, Yunju, Qibin, and Fucheng, the listed price of Chiang currency was above 30 yuan to 1 in the last ten days of November, and the black market was around 20 yuan to 1. During the same period, the black market in counties north of the Yellow River such as Junxian and Daokou Town had reached 25 to 40 yuan to 1. Overall, as of November 30th, the average exchange rate had fallen to 30 yuan of Chiang currency to 1 yuan of our currency.
    There were no major changes in gold and silver, and there were slight black market transactions in the border areas. At the end of November, the listed price of gold (per tael) in the mainland was between 100,000 and 150,000, and silver dollars were 700 to 1,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars in southern Shanxi was around 1,500, and the black market price of gold was as high as 300,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars south of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan was slightly weak, with the black market price around 2,000 yuan or more.
    Our Currency vs. Friendly Currencies: After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, merchants rushed to prepare to purchase goods, stimulating the rise of border currency, which was extremely scarce. Around November 20th, it once rose to a peak of 7 yuan of border currency to 1 yuan of our currency, but since the transportation of goods out of Shijiazhuang was not allowed, it soon fell back. At the end of November, counties such as Hengshui, Nangong, and Zhentang in southern Hebei had all fallen to 8 yuan to 8.5 jiao to 1, Gaoyi was 7.5 yuan to 1, and Pindang was 10 yuan to 1. Only Xingtai was still strong because some merchants raised huge amounts of money to set up shops in Shijiazhuang, and funds flowed north. On November 30th, the listed price in that area was 6.5 yuan to 1. During the same period, the listed price in Hejian, central Hebei, was 7 yuan to 1. The price ratio between central Hebei and our southern Hebei adjacent areas was still between 9 and 10 yuan to 1. The Northern currency of Shandong once rose in the first half of the month. In the past two weeks, due to the increase in the reserves of Northern currency in the market and the stability of commodity prices in our region, it also tended to fall back and stabilize. On November 30th, the exchange rate in Gucheng, Pingyuan, Hengshui, and Linqing in southern Hebei was 1.2 jiao to 1.37 fen to 1 yuan of our currency. South of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan was still 1 to 1. On November 27th, the listed price in the friendly area of Dezhou was 1.48 jiao to 1.

    半月来边区出入口贸易尚活跃：东线临清，衡水出口货种类增多，以花椒、桃仁、乌枣、芝麻为大宗，棉花次之，计临清一周各山货出口成交十余亿（蒋币），入口仍以火柴糖类为大宗。西线太岳平遥口岸下旬麻皮出口趋消沉，油类转活跃，晋南禹门口出口黄丝，棉花均快，黄丝在黄河西能售蒋币八○万元一斤。太行薄璧，下旬黄丝出口尚顺，铁货亦能零星输出，入口为火柴糖类、药品、油墨、纸张、洋线等，仍以货易货为主要交易，豫北方面，半月来在我军民展开政攻下，开辟了西沃、长泉等新口岸，均能零星输出黄丝、铁货及花椒、橡壳等。进输糖类，火柴颜料等货。
    金融情况
    两周来，冀南限制棉花出口影响汇价波动已成过去，蒋区金银物价却涨风再起，我土产山货输出顺畅，外汇供求正常，使汇价普遍回跌。临清十一月三十日济汇已跌至一比二十三元二角，津汇二十三元八角，该地每日成交外汇平均在五亿上下结存五亿至十亿；同期南宫济汇一比二十五元，衡水津汇二十三元八角；为克服票据商对外汇市场之操纵投机，严整对敌斗争阵营，临清并于十一月中旬指令票据号一律转业，同时改组外汇交易所，实行集中成交。太行高邑自我解放石庄后，蒋币挂牌价已降至一比一百元，辉县、安阳十一月底均一比二十五元，太谷、平定降至一比五十元，沁阳一比三十至四十元。太岳平遥十一月底亦降至一比四十元，晋南新区虽因近期棉花出口量巨，蒋币大量内流，及运城军事情况之影响，本币币值一度波动，但至月底蒋币行情在缝南、稷河、荣河等县，仍回跌至一比十五至廿之间。冀鲁豫蒋币亦续跌，黄河南菏泽、郓巨、齐滨、复程等县，十一月下旬蒋币挂牌均一比三十以上，黑市一比二十左右；同期黄河北浚县、道口镇等黑市且已至一比二十五至四十元。综合全区情况，截至十一月三十日为止，平均汇价已降至本币一元比蒋币三十元。
    金银无大变化，边沿地区略有黑市成交。十一月底内地黄金（每两）挂牌在十万至十五万之间，银元七○○至一○○○元，晋南银元价一五○○左右，黄金黑市并有高至三○万元者。冀鲁豫黄河南银元价略疲，黑市约在二○○○元以上。
    本币与友币：解放石庄后，商人纷纷准备前去办货，刺激边币昂挺奇缺，十一月二十日前后曾一度升至本币一元比边币七元之高峰，但以石庄不准运货外出，不久即回跌，十一月底冀南之衡水、南宫、振堂等县均已降至一比八元至八元五角，高邑一比七元五角，平定一比十元，唯邢台因有一部商人筹集巨款拟赴石庄设店，资金北流，故边币仍硬，十一月三十日该地挂牌一比六元五，同期冀中河间挂牌为一比七元。冀中与我冀南毗邻地区物价之比仍在一比九元至十元之间。山东之北币上半月一度上升，近两周来因市间北币储量增加，我区物价平稳，亦趋回跌转稳，十一月三十日冀南之故城、平原、衡水、临清等均北币一元比本币一元二角至一元三角七分，冀鲁豫黄河南仍一比一。友区德州十一月二十七日挂牌为一比一元四角八分。
