[This report from Taiyue on the 26th] The Second Business Office of Yuebei Trading Company is supporting production for hired and poor laborers, advancing 1.3 million chi of homespun cloth to purchase livestock from Northwest Shanxi. The Second Business Office recognized that to solve the difficulty hired and poor laborers will face obtaining draught animals for next year's production, a large quantity of homespun cloth must be exported to Northwest Shanxi to exchange for livestock. However, the journey is long, and waiting for the masses to spin and weave the cloth would delay next year's spring plowing. Therefore, it advanced 1.35 million chi of homespun cloth and took responsibility for transporting it to Northwest Shanxi to exchange for livestock for the masses. Those who need to buy livestock can obtain a letter of introduction from their respective counties, forwarded to the trading company, to personally select livestock in Northwest Shanxi. The trading company will advance the funds, to be repaid with cash or cloth upon their return. In addition, over the past half-month, it has organized large carts from Tunliu and Changzi to transport 1,350 shi and six dou of grain and 51,200 jin of cotton from Baodian, Changzhi, to Changzhi, earning a profit of 1,313,400 yuan for 300 carts. It also organized 24 carts from Baodian to deliver cloth to Zhaocheng, earning a profit of 700,000 yuan. From December 10th to 15th, it organized 103 carts to transport salt to Yicheng, carrying 37 carts of corn to Yangcheng on the outbound trip, earning 350,000 yuan in freight charges. The remaining 76 carts transported 201 shi of corn to Yangcheng, earning 600 yuan per dou. Poor farmers cannot afford mats, and sometimes the wives at home are still waiting to spin, so the business office advanced another 1,040,000 yuan and 1,080 jin of cotton. Hauling salt back, calculated over twelve days at an expense of 1,200 yuan per day, can still net a profit of 6,132,000 yuan. In total, during the first half of December, organizing mass transportation earned a profit of 8,145,400 yuan. According to Accountant Wang of the business office, they are actively bidding for transport contracts in Changzhi to continue organizing mass transportation.

　　岳北贸易公司第二营业处垫出土布
  　帮助雇贫去换牲口
    【本报太岳二十六日电】岳北贸易公司第二营业处，扶植雇贫生产，垫出土布一百三十万尺，向晋西北购买牲口。第二营业处看到，要解决雇贫明年生产中的畜力困难，必须以大批土布向晋西北输出，才能换回牲口，但路途遥远，而且待群众纺织出布匹再去换就耽误了明年春耕，因此特垫出土布一百三十五万尺，并负责运往晋西北为群众换回牲口。群众需要买牲口的，可由各县写介绍信转贸易公司，前往晋西北亲自挑选牲口，并由贸易公司垫支，回来再付钱，或付布。此外，半月来并组织屯留、长子大车，从长治鲍店到长治，送粮一千三百五十石零六斗，运棉花五万一千二百斤，三百辆车赚利一百三十一万三千四百元。又组织鲍店车廿四辆，往赵城送布，赚利七十万元。十二月十日至十五日，又组织一百零三辆车到翼城运盐，去时往阳城捎运玉茭三十七车，赚脚费三十五万元，其余七十六辆，自己量玉茭二百零一石，运到阳城，每斗可赚六百元。贫苦农民铺垫不起，有时家里老婆还等着纺花，于是营业处又预支一百零四万元及棉花一千零八十斤。回来拉盐，以十二天计算，每天开支一千二百元，还可净赚六百一十三万二千元。总计十二月上半月，组织群众运输，共赚利八百一十四万五千四百元。据营业处王会计谈，现正积极向长治方面包揽运脚，继续组织群众运输。
