Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: Jilin Daily, in its Three Check-Ups movement (checking class background, checking ideology, and checking work style), cleared out Tan Yingjia (original name Tan Qiantai), an enemy-puppet remnant, disguised landlord, and cultural traitor all in one, and his wife, Gong Xiaoguang, who engaged in instigation and sabotage. Tan came from a landlord and feudal bureaucrat family possessing hundreds of *mu* of fertile land. Before the "September 18th Incident," his father had served as director of the tax bureau for three terms. Tan himself graduated from the Manchukuo University of Law and Politics and served as a "High Judge" in the puppet Jilin Court. In three years, countless people were harmed by the numerous cases "judged" by his bloody hands. During the puppet Manchukuo period, he more loyally served the enemy puppets as a cultural traitor, frequently writing articles in traitorous magazines and newspapers such as "Mingming" and "Kangde News," translating and promoting the works of the "Emperor," and helping the Japanese bandits poison and enslave the youth of Northeast China. After "August 15th," Tan took the opportunity to infiltrate the People's Daily (the predecessor of Jilin Daily) in October 1945 as an editor, and at the same time opportunistically wormed his way into the Party. At that time, reactionary forces in Jilin were rampant, and this opportunist went to the newspaper office in the morning and waited in the court in the afternoon for the Kuomintang to "take over." After the Jilin Daily was moved to Yanji for publication, he secretly associated with his former classmate Wu Chang (original name Wu Longchang), a translator for the puppet Concordia Association who later became the director of the Kuomintang XX County Organization Department. In June 1946, when the democratic government searched for Wu Chang, Tan actually shielded him and inquired about news for him. Tan regarded the reactionary book "China's Destiny" written by Chiang Kai-shek as a treasure and kept it secretly until he was struggled against. He secretly hid thirty-six pieces of gold bracelets, gold rings, and gold necklaces, etc., and fox fur robes, etc., that his father and he had exploited from the people, pretending to be poor and selling things. He repeatedly complained to the newspaper office, complaining everywhere that the public was not taking good care of him. This August, he reported to the organization that gold he had never mentioned before was lost, and his wife, Gong Xiaoguang, even went to the Public Security Bureau to falsely accuse someone. At this point, the two hidden traitors were exposed. The entire staff of the newspaper then held a three-day struggle meeting from October 6th to 9th. At the meeting, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China expelled Tan from the Party, and the newspaper accepted the request of all the staff to hand Tan and Gong over to the democratic government for legal action.

　　吉林日报社深入三查清除汉奸地主谭英伽
    【新华社东北三日电】吉林日报社在查阶级、查思想、查作风的三查运动中，清除敌伪残余、化形地主、文化汉奸三位一体的谭英伽（原名谭乾泰）及其从事挑拨破坏的老婆宫晓光。谭出身于拥有百垧良田的地主兼封建官僚的家庭，其父在“九一八”前作过三任税捐局长，本人毕业于伪满法政大学，曾任伪吉林法院“高等审判官”，在三年中由他的血手“判决”的无数案件惨遭伤害的人民数以万计。伪满时，更忠心为敌伪充当文化汉奸，经常在“明明”、“康德新闻”等奸伪杂志报纸写文章，翻译宣扬“天皇”的作品，帮助日寇毒化奴役东北青年。“八一五”后谭趁机于一九四五年十月混入人民日报（吉林日报前身）作编辑，同时投机钻入党内。当时吉林反动势力嚣张，这个投机分子便上午到报社，下午守在法院等候蒋党“接收”，吉林日报移至延吉出版后，他与旧日同学伪协和会翻译后任蒋党××县组织部长的吴昌（原名吴隆昌）密相往来。一九四六年六月民主政府搜捕吴昌，谭竟加以庇护并代探听消息。蒋匪所著反动书籍“中国之命运”，谭视为珍品，一直秘藏到被斗争。他将他们父子剥削人民而来的金镯子、金戒指、金项链等三十六件及狐狸皮袍等密藏起来，装穷卖东西，几次向报社叫苦，到处发牢骚，埋怨公家照顾不好。今年八月他向组织报告他从未讲过的金子丢了，他老婆宫晓光并到公安处去诬告，至此两个暗奸分子便原形毕露。报社全体干部遂于十月六日至九日连开三天斗争大会，在大会上中共吉林省委将谭开除党籍，报社接受全体干部要求将谭宫二人送交民主政府法办。
