    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 15th] During the recent Yuanshi liberation battle, the vast numbers of emancipated peasants in western Hebei eagerly participated in the fighting amidst the artillery fire, enthusiastically provided comfort to the troops at the front lines, and pursued and suppressed the remnant bandit forces of the traitor Wei Yonghe who had scattered. After hearing the news of the attack on Yuanshi, the masses from Xingtai, Zanhuang, Yuanshi, Lincheng, Jingxing, Zhao County, Luancheng, and other counties immediately and automatically collected慰劳品 [comfort items] and launched a support-the-army campaign. Women from Yuanshi, Louzhuang, Duzhuang, Shangzhang, and other villages jointly formed a慰问团 [comfort group], carrying eggs, biscuits, peanuts, cigarettes, etc., and holding a banner that read "Avenge our fathers, elders, sisters, and brothers." They passed through the enemy's dense firepower and entered the trenches to offer comfort. The trenches were filled with warm greetings. They stayed by the soldiers' sides, waiting until our revenge shells blossomed one by one on the enemy's bunkers and the beast soldiers rolled to the ground with the collapsing bricks and tiles. Only then did they happily smile and say, "You fought so well!" and joyfully left the trenches. Women from San Su Yang and other villages in the east corner of the city organized themselves to take care of the wounded on the third day after liberation. They stayed by the side of the wounded all day long, bringing water and food without tiring. At the beginning of the city attack, men and women from all over competed to carry stretchers and rescue the wounded. Zanhuang provided one hundred stretchers and more than five hundred people to rescue the wounded alongside the attacking troops. The stretcher squad leader, Hu Sihai, rescued three wounded soldiers by himself. When Jiang Baiyan from Gushan Village carried a wounded soldier down from the front line, he quickly spread his own mattress on the stretcher and carefully cared for him along the way, afraid that the wounded soldier would get cold. Women in a village, led by the spinning and weaving hero Zhu Yinquan, formed a 32-member stretcher team, which transported the wounded three times overnight, enabling two seriously wounded soldiers to receive timely treatment and survive the danger period. When they carried the wounded through Yangze Village late at night, they moved the women of the village, who immediately organized several stretchers and also went to carry the wounded. Under the slogan "Let us sweat more so that the troops can bleed less," the emancipated peasants of Yuanshi helped the army build fortifications in places only four or five zhang [a Chinese unit of length] away from the enemy. Enemy bullets rained down, flying over their heads, but they calmly dug ditches and built bunkers for three consecutive nights. Hundreds of peasants from Jingxia, Baicun, Dongjia, and other villages followed the army to Xiguan to repair fortifications. An enemy battalion突进 [suddenly advanced] out of the city. The troops advised them to retreat a little, but they repeatedly refused and continued to repair until dawn before returning. The peasants of Yangjiazhai personally transported explosives to the bunkers and buried them. During the city attack, the militia self-defense teams staying behind to guard the rear maintained strict sentry posts and actively captured the scattered remnants of the traitorous Wei forces. In one day, five villages, including Xihan, Liangzhuang, and Sunjiazhuang in Gaoyi, captured 17 people, including Yang Yuxin, the third battalion commander of the traitorous Wei forces, seized two American-made machine guns, twelve rifles, one German-made Mauser pistol, and 1,432 rounds of ammunition. When our army attacked into the city, Yang Yuxin led more than sixty people to break out of the city, but they were discovered by the self-defense militia of Liangzhuang and other villages, who联合 [jointly] pursued and suppressed them all the way to Dawang Village in Baixiang County. The enemy scattered in all directions and seventeen were captured by us. Du Changying, a murderous demon king who had previously served as the captain of the Japanese invaders' plainclothes "puppet army" and had massacred 45 of our cadres and masses, was captured alive by Chen Yunrui, an emancipated peasant, in Beixiulin Village, Jingxing, while fleeing to Taiyuan.
