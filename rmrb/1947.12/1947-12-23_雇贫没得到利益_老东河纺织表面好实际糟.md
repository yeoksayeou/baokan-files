Hired Labor Doesn't Benefit
Lao Donghe Textile Appears Good but is Actually Terrible

The textile work in Lao Donghe Village, Huguan County, appears to have laid a textile foundation after two hundred-day textile movements, spinning 1,188 catties of cotton and weaving 1,227 catties of cloth, developing seventy-five spinning women, twenty-one weaving women, eighty spinning wheels, and twenty-one quick looms. However, after in-depth inspection, there are significant problems.

During the first hundred-day textile movement, Lao Donghe exceeded the original plan, but the benefit to hired labor was not significant. Of the 872.11 catties of cotton spun, only 273 catties were spun by new middle peasants, 375.8 catties by old middle peasants, and 224.4 catties by eleven target of struggle households. Of the 827 catties of cloth woven, only 232 catties were woven by new middle peasants, averaging 2.468 *zhang* per person; 491 catties were woven by old middle peasants, averaging 4.46 *zhang* per person; and 100 catties were woven by old rich peasants, averaging more than 8 *zhang* per person. However, the needs of new middle peasants far exceed those of old middle peasants. Among the nineteen people without winter clothes, nine are new middle peasants who genuinely cannot change with the season.

Looking at the leadership composition: of the seven textile groups in the village, five group leaders are old middle peasants and two are new middle peasants. One of these two new middle peasants has a landlord as maternal relatives. Looking at the composition of weaving women and the mastery of tools: in the first hundred-day textile movement, there was only one new middle peasant among the ten weaving women; in the second hundred-day textile movement, there were four new middle peasants among the twenty-one weaving women, eleven old middle peasants, and also four old rich peasants. Of the twenty-one looms in the village, old middle peasants own 10.885 looms, and the four looms in the village factory are also controlled by old middle peasants, not available to hired peasant women. Therefore, hired peasants see the apparent benefits but cannot obtain them, and must exchange their spun thread for cloth. The main reason for these phenomena is the lack of a clear class perspective in the textile work, with a serious "task-oriented viewpoint." When mobilizing textile production, cultivating weaving women and developing tools were not prioritized for hired peasants, but only sought to quickly get things done and complete tasks on time, focusing only on old middle peasant women who could leave home. When mobilizing the masses to pool resources for looms, the difficulties of hired peasants were not understood, and only seven looms were made, without pooling resources to buy parts. However, a set of shuttle, *zhu*, and *@* costs 11,000 yuan, which hired peasants cannot afford, so they cannot weave the spun thread. As Li Lisong's wife said: "I really want to learn, and I know that weaving is better than spinning, but we don't have money to buy *zhu*, shuttle, and *@*, so it's just empty talk." The women's salvation secretary also said: "I pooled resources to make a loom, but it's being used by someone else (referring to a middle peasant). I'll spin some thread to earn some money to buy parts and learn during the New Year."

When setting the textile plan for this winter, the old approach of "completing a certain number of catties of native cloth" was broken. Based on the actual needs of the masses, they were encouraged to calculate their own assets and set their own plans, clarifying their own goals. At the same time, key members of the hired peasants were established to solve the difficulties of hired peasants, and the seven looms made with pooled resources and the three publicly owned looms were rotated from middle peasants to hired peasants. The 200,000 loan from August was completely transferred to 23 hired peasant households in the form of collection to solve the difficulties of capital, tools, and raw materials. It was also decided to cultivate a large number of hired peasant weaving women this winter, making them versatile in both spinning and weaving.

[This newspaper's Licheng Dispatch] The Ren Village Textile work is relatively good in the Second District. During this year's hundred-day textile movement, a total of 1,186.7 *chi* of cloth were woven, with each woman weaving 14 catties of cloth, which is a very good overall achievement. However, looking at each class, hired laborers averaged a little over 5 *zhang* woven per worker, middle peasants averaged a little over 10 *zhang* per worker, rich peasants averaged a little over 13 *zhang* per person, and landlords averaged a little over 10 *zhang* per person. It appears that hired laborers benefited the least and rich peasants benefited the most, even landlords benefited more than hired laborers. This does not meet the basic requirements of our textile development. Why did hired laborers not benefit? The basic reason is that hired laborers were not mobilized and rich peasants were in power. Of the five women's salvation cadres, two were rich peasants, two were middle peasants, and one was a poor hired laborer. Among the fourteen group leaders, only three were hired laborers, seven were middle peasants, and four were rich peasants. The textile equivalent is also unfair. For example, weaving one *chi* of cloth is counted as one point, while spinning one *liang* of thread is counted as two points. Each woman can weave an average of 1.2 *zhang* per day, earning twelve points, while a spinning woman spins four *liang* of cotton per day, only earning eight points. Also, weaving one catty of cloth can be exchanged for spinning ten *liang* of cotton. Weaving for two days can be exchanged for two and a half days of spinning work for a spinning woman. Overall, weaving women exploit spinning women. The village has 65 weaving women, 23 rich and middle peasants, 21 middle peasants, 17 hired peasants, and 4 landlords. Clearly, it can be seen that rich peasants are exploiting poor peasants.

In addition, from a purely technical perspective in leadership, a total of 48 people were commended in this spring's textile movement, only 11 of whom were hired laborers, 17 were middle peasants, 16 were rich peasants, and even 4 were landlords.

Furthermore, the village cooperative is solely for profit and does not support hired peasant textiles. Even when it provides a loom for a hired peasant, it still charges a monthly profit of over 40%. Liang Ernv, a hired peasant woman, said: "Working like this for a year is not enough to pay the cooperative's profit." Even now, Li Aiye, Zhang Caiyu, and others still owe the cooperative over 20,000 yuan each for textiles.

### 雇贫没得到利益　老东河纺织表面好实际糟

　　雇贫没得到利益
  　老东河纺织表面好实际糟
    壶关老东河村的纺织工作，从表面上看经过两个百日纺织运动，纺花一一八八斤，织布一二二七斤，发展纺妇七十五个，织妇二一个、纺车八○辆，快机二一架，好象已打下纺织基础。但经深入检查，其中存在很大问题。
    第一个百日纺织老东河超过原订计划，但雇贫得利并不大。纺花八七二·一一斤中，新中农才二七三斤，旧中就三七五·八斤，而十一户斗争对象就纺二二四·四斤。织布八二七斤中，新中才二三二斤，每人平均二、四六八斤，老中织四九一斤，每人平均四·四六丈，旧富织一○○斤，每人合八丈多。而新中需要却远远超过旧中。今冬没衣服的一九人中，就有九个新中是真正换不了季。
    就领导成份看：全村七个纺织小组，七个组长有五个是老中农，两个是新中农。这两个新中农中还有一个娘家是地主。从织妇成份与工具的掌握上看：第一个百纺中十个织妇，新中才一个，第二个百纺二一个织妇中新中四个，旧中就十一个，旧富农也是四个。全村织机二一架，旧中农就有一○·八八五架，村工厂的四架也是为旧中农掌握，轮不到雇贫妇女手里。因之雇贫农看着利大取不上，却非拿上线子去换布不可。造成这些现象的原因，主要是纺织工作上阶级观点不明确，而抱着严重的“任务观点”。在发动纺织时，培养织妇发展工具都不是从雇贫为主，而是只求马上能出来干按时完成任务就行，就只注意了能离家的老中农妇女。发动群众伙做机时，不了解雇贫困难，就只做了七个机，没有伙买零件，决定谁学谁买。但买一套梭、杼、＠就得一万一千元，雇贫买不起，所以纺下线子不能织。如李立嵩妻说：“我也很想学，也知道织比纺强，只是咱没钱，买不起杼、梭、＠、也是妄言”。妇救秘书也说：“我伙做了一架机，人家用的哩（指中农），我纺上些线赚上个钱买上零件过年学吧”。
    今冬订纺织计划时，就打破了“要完成土布若干斤”的老一套作法，根据群众实际需要，启发群众自己算家当订计划，明确自己的奋斗目标。同时树立雇贫骨干解决雇贫困难，把伙做的七架织机和公有的三架，以轮流方式由中农转给雇贫使用。把八月份的二十万贷款以收款方式完全转给二三户雇贫解决资金工具原料困难。并决定在今冬要大量培养雇贫织妇，使成为能纺能织的双把式。
    【本报黎城讯】仁庄纺织工作，在二区是比较好的，今年百日纺织运动中，共织布一千一百八十六尺七寸，每个妇女织布十四斤，总的成绩很好。但从各阶层来看，雇贫每个劳力平均织五丈多，中农每个劳力平均十丈多，富农每人平均十三丈多，地主每人平均十丈多。这样看来，雇贫得利最少，富农得利最多，甚至地主亦高过雇贫。没有达到我们发展纺织的基本要求。为什么雇贫没有得利呢？基本原因是雇贫没有发动，富农当权。五个妇救干部有富农两个、中农两个、贫雇一个，十四个小组长，雇贫仅有三个，中农七个，富农四个。纺织等价也不公道，如织一尺布作一分，纺一两线作二分，每个妇女平均一天能织一丈二尺，作十二分，纺妇每日纺四两花，只顶八分。还有织一斤布换纺十两花，织布两天可换到纺妇两天半工，总的看来，织妇剥削了纺妇。按该村六十五个织妇，富中二十三人，中农二十一人，雇贫十七人，地主四人，很显明的，可以看出是富农剥削了贫农。
    另外在领导上，单纯技术观点，在今春纺织运动中，共表扬了四十八人，雇贫仅占十一人，中农十七人，富农竟有十六人，地主还有四人。
    再则、该村合作社单纯为了营利，不扶植雇贫纺织，给雇贫做了一架机，还得按月四分多得利，雇贫妇女梁二女说：“这样忙一年，还不够交合作社利钱”。直到现在，李爱叶、张菜鱼等四人，为了纺织每人还欠下合作社洋两万余元。
