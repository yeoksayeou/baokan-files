Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 12th: Chiang Kai-shek's gang's wild propaganda of "clearing" the People's Liberation Army in the Dabie Mountains has completely failed. Even the Shanghai "Observation" weekly, Volume 3, Issue 12 (published November 15th), which is related to Chiang Kai-shek's officialdom, had to admit in an article titled "Storm Clouds Gathering in Central China": "Judging from various signs, the Dabie Mountains base area of the Communist Army (People's Liberation Army) has already been established." The article acknowledged that the counter-offensive by our various armies in the southern front has caused Chiang Kai-shek's gang to "currently only hold the three major strongholds of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang, and the southern section of the Pinghan Railway." Because our Northern Shaanxi People's Liberation Army heroically advanced around Yan'an, "Hu Zongnan's troops are unable to leave Tongguan to aid western Henan," and "the Kuomintang (Chiang Kai-shek's gang) south of the Yangtze River has no troops to deploy"; Chiang Kai-shek's gang's depleted troop strength and desperate situation are fully exposed. An article in the same issue titled "Unveiling the Inside Story of Western Henan," in addition to making shameless slanders against the People's Liberation Army, also had to admit the cowardice and brutal ugliness of Chiang Kai-shek's troops: "Wherever the (Chiang Kai-shek's) Central Army goes, they first build city walls and bunkers, always hiding inside the city. Unless the Communist Army (People's Liberation Army) comes to attack the city, they dare not easily go to the countryside to 'sweep'. Even if they occasionally go out of the city to 'sweep', they only go early and return early, and tie up some 'Communist sympathizer' civilians. The reason for their cowardice is that the soldiers are forced and not voluntary; they are all produced from the buying and selling system." The article reported the suffering of the people in western Henan before our army liberated it: "The (Chiang Kai-shek's) Central Army kills the goose that lays the golden eggs and drains the pond to catch all the fish. Before the 'requisition purchase' is completed, there is another 'urgent purchase'; before the 'urgent purchase' has even started, there is a 'scramble purchase' in the middle of the night."

    蒋记刊物供认中原战局不利
    江南蒋匪无兵可调
    被迫摆出挨打架势
    【新华社陕北十二日电】蒋匪在大别山“肃清”人民解放军的狂妄宣传完全破产，甚至与蒋匪官方有关的上海观察周刊三卷十二期（十一月十五日出版）“八方风雨会中州”一文，亦不得不承认：“从种种迹象看，现在共军（人民解放军）的大别山根据地是已经建立了。”该文承认，由于南线我各路大军反攻，使蒋匪“目前仅保有汴、郑、洛三大据点及平汉南段一线。”由于我陕北人民解放军绕过延安英勇前进，使“胡宗南部无力出潼关援助豫西”，而“长江以南国军（蒋匪）更无兵可调”；蒋匪兵力空虚窘态毕露。该刊同期“揭开豫西的内幕”一文，除对人民解放军横加无耻诬蔑外，也不能不承认蒋匪军的怯懦和残暴的丑态：“（蒋匪）中央军每到一处，先要修城墙，筑碉堡，始终是躲在城内。除非共军（人民解放军）前去攻城，他是不敢轻易下乡‘扫荡’的。偶而出城‘扫荡’，也只是早去早回，绑来些‘通匪’的老百姓。其怯懦原因是因为兵士是被迫而非自愿，都是从买卖制度下产生的。”该文报导豫西为我军解放前的人民苦难称：“（蒋匪）中央军杀鸡取卵，竭泽而渔，什么‘征购’还没有征齐，却又来个‘急购’；‘急购’还没开始，半夜里却又来个‘抢购’。”
