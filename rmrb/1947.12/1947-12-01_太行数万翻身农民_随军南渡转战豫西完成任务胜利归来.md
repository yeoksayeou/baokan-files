[This report from our Taihang correspondent on the 27th] Tens of thousands of liberated farmers from Taihang who followed the army to participate in the war have victoriously completed their support-the-front mission in the front lines of western Henan and are returning home in batches. This contingent swore an oath on August 1st to cross the river south with our Qin and Huang counter-offensive forces. For three months, the militiamen, relying solely on a rifle each, under the invincible might of our great army, protected all the stretcher and transport teams, traversing the wilderness of western Henan, notorious for local reactionary armed forces. The Chiang Kai-shek and puppet forces did not dare to easily invade. Transport team members braved the strafing of Chiang Kai-shek's planes and, on roads made treacherous by continuous rain and mud, successfully transported huge quantities of military supplies across the Yellow River to the front lines. Stretcher team members, after crossing the river, went straight to the front lines without rest. Once, enemy bullets hit the village where the transport team was stationed, but they calmly rushed all the ammunition out. The Lingchuan transport team, during the battle of X town, carrying ladders and ammunition, had just reached the front line when the situation became critical, and they immediately transformed into a stretcher team. Transport team members from a certain county discarded their own clothes and, with two people carrying a stretcher normally carried by four, rescued the wounded. Zhang Xueying from the seventh district of Lingchuan, leading ten stretchers, crawled through a crossing blocked by four enemy machine guns, rescuing ten wounded soldiers. On the road, in pouring rain, they covered the wounded soldiers with their own clothes and straw hats. Zhang Guinian lost his shoes and walked ninety li barefoot. At night, they took turns caring for the wounded. When the wounded needed to defecate and there were no bedpans, Peng Huanan and Ma Heier used their own handkerchiefs to wrap up the excrement and take it out. The stretcher team from the second district of Qinyang rescued wounded soldiers four times at the front lines. While carrying the spoils of victory, team member Zhi Shiye did not take a single bit of property. When comrades from the troops offered him a yellow blanket, he resolutely declined, fearing it would hinder the transport of military supplies, and instead carried back a box of artillery shells. They also truly did not take a single needle or thread from the masses. In X, they helped the masses feed their livestock and, discovering two bundles buried in a grass basket, returned them to the landlord untouched. Under the difficult conditions of manpower and resources in the new district, militiamen, transport teams, and stretcher teams often served two or even three purposes, putting down carrying poles to carry stretchers, putting down stretchers to carry carrying poles, carrying a rifle on one shoulder and a ladder on the other, serving as both stretcher teams and nurses. Wherever they went, they conducted propaganda, introducing to the masses the experience of liberation and the happy life after liberation in the old liberated areas, organizing the masses to struggle against landlords for grain, seeds, and clothing, and confiscating the property of the most heinous despotic landlords. They also organized poor peasant groups, cultivated cadres, ignited sparks everywhere, and sowed seeds. For example, in Potou Village, X County, our Qinyang second district stretcher team used their own surplus wheat to relieve fifteen poor old farmers and mobilized them to borrow grain from landlords. After we moved on, an old man named Han led the poor to continue the struggle. Such exemplary stories of the people loving the army and the people loving the people are widely spread in the vast new districts of western Henan. The masses in the new districts warmly welcomed and saw off this contingent everywhere, and our military commanders and fighters loved them even more like their own brothers. Before this victorious return, the soldiers and civilians on the front lines held gatherings to congratulate them on their merits. The X unit awarded Wang Zhenzhong and eight other combat heroes from the Qinyang second district stretcher team merit certificates inscribed with "It is an unparalleled honor to perform meritorious service on the shoulders." They also presented the contingent with banners inscribed with "Following the Army South, Achieving Meritorious Service," as well as eight rifles and many items of clothing. Another militia company was awarded three small cannons and a machine gun by a certain unit of our army, which they happily carried across the Yellow River on their return journey. Liu Mei, Deputy Commissioner of the Fourth Administrative Office of Taihang, one of the leaders who personally led the contingent south, praised the participating masses as "a political army fighting alongside the People's Liberation Army." According to Deputy Commissioner Liu: The Southbound Expedition Participating Team achieved outstanding results, mainly because all of them were liberated farmers. The county, district, and village cadres and Communist Party members who led the expedition were always with the masses during the participation in the war, and in emergencies, they took the lead with their own exemplary actions, carrying stretchers and loads. During marching and camping, they seized the time to commend, evaluate, check discipline, and summarize experiences, which boosted and consolidated everyone's fighting spirit. Under the mobilization slogan of "Crossing the River to Participate in the War to Eradicate Roots and Helping the People of the New District Achieve Great Liberation," they also widely launched the movement of the people loving the army and the people loving the people, thus successfully completing the arduous task of supporting the front and overcoming the difficulties faced by our army in penetrating the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas.

　　太行数万翻身农民
     随军南渡转战豫西完成任务胜利归来
    【本报太行二十七日电】随军远征参战的太行翻身农民×万人，在豫西前线协助我军作战，已胜利完成支前任务，分批荣归。该队自八月一日随我秦、黄反攻大军誓师南渡，三个月来，民兵仅凭每人一枝步枪，在我大军无敌的神威下，掩护着所有担架队、运输队，纵横于土顽武装向称猖獗的豫西原野，蒋伪未敢轻易进犯。运输队员曾冒着蒋机的扫射，在连日霪雨泥泞不堪的道路上，把巨量军用品顺利地运过黄河送达前线。担架队员过河后未休息即奔赴前线；一次敌人的子弹已打到运输队的驻村，但他们仍沉着的将全部弹药抢运出来。陵川运输队，在打×镇时，抬着梯子、弹药刚到火线，情况紧急，他们立刻变为担架队。某县运输队员丢掉自己的衣服，两人抬一付四人抬的担架，抢救伤员。陵川七区张雪英带着十付担架，爬着通过敌人四挺机枪封锁的路口，抢救出十个彩号。在路上淋淋大雨中，他们把自己衣服、草帽都给彩号盖上。张贵年丢了鞋子，赤脚走了九十里路，夜间他们还轮流看护伤员，伤员大便没有大便盆，彭化南、马黑儿用自己的手巾把屎包出去。沁阳二区担架队，火线上连抢四次彩号；在搬运胜利品时，队员职世业不检一点资财，部队同志送他一条黄毯，他怕妨碍抢运军用物资，坚决谢绝，多扛了一箱炮弹回来。他们并真正做到不拿群众一针一线，在×地帮助群众喂牲口，发现草筐内埋藏两个包袱，原封送还房东。在新区人力物力的困难情况下，民兵、运输队、担架队，往往是两用甚至三用，放下扁担抬担架，放下担架挑扁担，一肩扛枪、一肩扛梯，又是担架队、又是看护员。所到之处，进出宣传，给群众介绍老解放区翻身经验与翻身后的幸福生活，组织群众向地主进行借粮、借种子、借衣服的斗争，抄没罪大恶极的恶霸地主；并组织贫农小组，培养干部，到处点火，撒播种子。如在×县坡头村，我沁阳二区担架队，以自己节余的麦子，救济了十五个穷苦老农，并发动他们向地主借粮。我们转移后，一个姓韩的老头，即带领穷人继续进行斗争。这种民爱军、民爱民的模范佳话，盛传豫西广大新区。该队到处备受新区群众热烈迎接与欢送，我军指战员对他们则更热爱如同手足。此次荣归前，前线军民均纷纷集会为他们贺功。×部曾奖给沁阳二区担架队员王振忠等九位参战功臣书有“肩上立功无上光荣”的记功证。并以“随军南征，汗马立功”等锦旗及步枪八枝、衣服多件，赠给该队。另一民兵中队，并荣获我军某部奖给三门小炮，一挺机枪，欢欣地扛着渡河北返。亲率该队南下的领导者之一，太行四专署刘梅副专员，对此次参战群众誉为“与人民解放军并肩作战的一支政治大军”。据刘副专员称：南下远征参战队功绩卓著，其主要原因是由于全部都是翻身农民，率队远征的县、区、村干部及共产党员，在参战中始终与群众在一起，紧急情况下并以自己的模范行动，抬担架、挑东西。在行军宿营中抓紧表功、评功、检查纪律、总结经验等，鼓舞与巩固大家战斗情绪，在“过河参战刨老根，帮助新区人民大翻身”的动员口号下，并广泛开展了民爱军，民爱民运动，故得以胜利完成繁重的支前任务，克服了我军深入蒋占区作战的困难。
