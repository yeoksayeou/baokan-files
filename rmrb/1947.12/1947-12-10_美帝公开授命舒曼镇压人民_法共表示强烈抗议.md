　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Comprehensive reports: American warmonger Dulles, in his capacity as Marshall's personal representative, arrived in France on the 4th to convey to the Schuman cabinet, the Socialist Party leader Blum, and the coup-plotting De Gaulle, the American order to suppress the French people (especially the strike movement). This move has aroused strong protests from the French people. The French people's indignation is expressed in the communiqué of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group. The communiqué was read out in the National Assembly by French Communist Party member Guya one day before Dulles left France (i.e., the 6th). The communiqué stated: "The Communist parliamentary group strongly protests against the U.S. government's intolerable interference in French internal affairs. France is now being treated as a colony. American masters openly and shamelessly dictate their conditions to Paris and give various orders to French ministers and politicians. The Communist parliamentary group especially protests against the shameless lies issued by Dulles, who dares to treat the French people like Hitler's occupiers, attempting to divide them. The French Communist Party feels proud because the American imperialism, which wants to enslave France, regards the French Communist Party as its enemy." The communiqué concluded: "The Communist parliamentary group expresses its belief that all republicans and patriots will know how to unite in order to victoriously defend France's sovereignty and independence."
　　
　　This communiqué from the French Communist Party caused panic among the French reactionary authorities. Socialist Labor Minister Mayer yelped: "The government is free to treat its friends and allies."
　　
　　Under the orders of U.S. imperialism, the French authorities made some conciliatory gestures to cover up their implementation of more brutal force. Mayer falsely claimed in the parliament on the 6th: "The government does not oppose general wage increases," and also said: "Negotiations with the General Confederation of Labor have not broken down." However, news from all over France indicates that the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have completely aligned themselves with the De Gaulle fascist alliance. Socialist Interior Minister Moch openly announced to the parliament on the 6th that, according to the 1930 police law, the police and gendarmes have the right to shoot at the masses when necessary. On the same day, French police indiscriminately made arrests in various places. According to a United Press report on the 6th, the number of arrested strikers has reached 230. In Marseille alone, 70 people were arrested on the 5th. Due to the government's use of the police and deliberate provocation, the situation in southern France remains tense. Conflicts in Toulouse, the railway center, and the southern coal mining area have increased endlessly.

　　美帝公开授命舒曼镇压人民
    法共表示强烈抗议
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合报导：美国战争贩子杜勒斯，以马歇尔私人代表资格于四日抵法，向舒曼内阁，社会党头子勃鲁姆，及阴谋政变的戴高乐等，传达美国镇压法国人民（特别是罢工运动）之命令，此举已引起法国人民的强烈抗议。法国人民之义愤，表现于法共议会党团之公报中。该公报由法共议员格雅于杜勒斯离法前一日（即六日）在国民议会上宣读。公报称：“共产党议会党团强烈抗议美国政府对法国内政作不能容忍的干涉。法国现在已被当作殖民地看待。美国主子们公开而无耻地将他们的条件授命给巴黎，并给予法国部长和政客们各种命令。共产党议会党团特别抗议杜勒斯所发的无耻谰言，他竟敢象希特勒占领者一样看待法国人民，企图分裂他们。法国共产党感到自豪，因为想奴役法国的美美国帝国主义把法共视为敌人。”公报结语称：“共产党议会党团表示他的信念；一切共和主义者和爱国人士将懂得如何团结起来，以便能胜利地保卫法国的主权与独立。”
    法共此一公报引起法国反动当局之惊慌，社会党劳工部长梅耶狺狺叫道：“政府可以自由对待其朋友和盟国。”
    在美国帝国主义命令下，法国当局做出若干缓和姿态，以掩盖其实行更残暴的武力手段。梅耶六日在议会上诡称：“政府并不反对一般增资”，又称：“和总工会的谈判并未破裂。”可是法国各地的消息指出，社会党与人民共和党已完全与戴高乐法西斯联盟一致行动。社会党内政部长摩许六日更公然向议会宣布，按照一九三○年之警卫法，警宪于必要时，有向群众开枪之权。同日，法国警察即于各地滥肆逮捕，据合众社六日电，被捕之罢工者已达二百三十名。仅马赛一地，五日被捕者即达七十人。由于政府使用警察，蓄意挑衅，法国南部的局势仍然紧张。铁路中心的土鲁斯及南方煤矿区的冲突有增无巳。
