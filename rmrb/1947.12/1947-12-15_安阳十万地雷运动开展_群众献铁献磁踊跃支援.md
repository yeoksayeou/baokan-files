    Anyang Ten Thousand Landmine Movement Unfolds
    The Masses Enthusiastically Donate Iron and Magnetite to Support It
    [Report from this newspaper] After the Anyang Ten Thousand Landmine Explosion Movement was launched, the masses in various villages were very excited and full of confidence. Everyone actively participated in and supported this movement, donating raw materials such as iron, bottles, magnets, and tinplate. According to statistics from two days, two districts alone donated more than 1,400 jin of iron and dozens of tinplate buckets. Moreover, each district dispatched a large number of technical workers, braving the cold to participate in the rush to produce various landmines. After everyone's research, the landmine manufacturing technology has been improved, and the power is very great. One can blow up an area of more than 200 meters in length and width, and can eliminate an enemy squad. At present, the masses are increasingly involved in this movement.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taihang, 12th] Since the Anyang Ninth District Armed Work Team and the broad masses of militiamen launched the Ten Thousand Landmine Explosion Movement, they have advanced behind enemy lines, actively destroying and exploding along the Pinghan Railway line for thirty miles and in the vast area west of the road. In the ten days from the 13th to the 23rd of this month, they fought fourteen times, detonated twenty-five landmines, killing or wounding ninety enemies below the rank of squad leader, and capturing one rifle. On the 13th, Liu Lexian's local bandit troops of Anyang went to Zhang Village to rob grain. Our Anyang Yuan Armed Work Team and the militiamen from the Seventh District who came to support surrounded the enemy in the vicinity of Zhang Village and severely attacked them, killing or wounding more than ten enemies. An enemy battalion from the Fortieth Division came to help, but was also repelled. On the night of the 14th, the railway north and south of Tian Village was sabotaged for several miles, and the Jianxin Township Public Office team of more than one hundred people who came out to harass were lured into the minefield, killing or wounding eight enemies. On the 17th, the militiamen and armed work team of this district, together with the militiamen of Ye County and Tangyin and other places, took advantage of the victory to attack the enemy stronghold in Beitian Village. After our comrade Sun Jianfu used a grenade to kill an enemy sentry, the militiamen launched a general attack from the southwest and northeast, with the sound of artillery rumbling and flames soaring into the sky, and then rushed into the village. The enemy Township Public Office team fled in all directions. We killed or wounded more than ten enemies below the rank of squad leader. The Township Public Office fled to Nantian, not daring to return. Afterwards, the puppet Township Chief Li Ying became enraged and executed the village head of Beitian Village and five soldiers for the crime of incompetence in combat, and executed two civilians for the crime of communicating with the Eighth Route Army. The rest were driven to the east of the road. The masses who were unwilling to be oppressed by the Chiang bandits fled to our district one after another. Our government immediately allocated grain for relief, and the masses in various villages also automatically lent livestock to help the masses move. The masses of Beitian Village said with emotion: "In the past, we only said that the Township Public Office was from our village and protected us, but now we know that only the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are our backers." Now the fleeing masses have joined the militia one after another and are fighting the enemy.

    【本报讯】安阳十万个地雷爆炸运动展开后，各村群众都很兴奋，充满信心。大家都踊跃参加与支援这一运动，纷纷献铁、献瓶、献磁、献洋铁等原料，据两日统计，仅两个区即献铁一千四百余斤，洋铁桶数十个，并且各区派大批技术工人，不畏寒冷，参加赶制各种地雷，经过大家研究，提高了制雷技术，威力很大，一个可炸纵横面积二百多米达，能消灭敌人一个班，目前群众正日益扩大卷入这一运动中。
    【本报太行十二日电】安阳九区武工队及广大民兵，自展开十万个地雷爆炸运动后，即挺进敌后，在三十里长的平汉沿线及路西广大地区，积极破击爆炸。本月十三日到二十三日十天中，作战十四次，爆炸地雷二十五个，炸死伤敌分队长以下九十人，缴获步枪一枝。十三日，安阳土顽刘乐仙部八十余人到张村抢粮，我安阳元武工队与来援之七区民兵，将敌团团包围在张村附近予以痛击，毙伤敌十余名；敌四十师一个营来援助，也被击退。十四日夜，又将田村南北铁路破击数里，并将出扰之建新乡公所团队百余人诱入雷区，炸死伤敌八名。十七日，该区民兵、武工队联合邺县、汤阴等地民兵，趁胜强攻北田村敌据点。我孙建富同志以手榴弹将敌哨兵炸死后，民兵即以西南、东北发动总攻，炮声隆隆，火光冲天，随即突进村内，敌乡公所团队四处逃窜，我毙伤敌分队长以下十余名，乡公所逃往南田，不敢回来。事后伪乡长李英恼羞成怒，将北田村保长和五个士兵以作战无能罪，执行枪决，并以通八路罪枪毙老百姓两人，其余均被赶往路东。不愿受蒋匪压榨的群众，纷纷逃至我区。我政府当即拨粮救济，各村群众亦自动借给牲口，帮群众搬家。北田村群众感动的说：“以前只说乡公所是本村人，保护我们，现在才知道只有共产党八路军是我们的靠山。”现逃出群众纷纷参加民兵，与敌作战。
