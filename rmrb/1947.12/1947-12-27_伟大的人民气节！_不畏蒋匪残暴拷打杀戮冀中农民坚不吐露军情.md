　　Great People's Integrity!
　　Jizhong Peasants, Undaunted by Chiang Kai-shek's Brutal Torture and Slaughter, Refuse to Divulge Military Secrets
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd】 From November 24th to 30th, when Chiang Kai-shek's 16th Army, 22nd Division, and 62nd Army, 95th Division, conducted a "mopping-up" operation in the Ping-Tian-Bao triangle area, they released poison gas in Longhu Village, Yongqing County, suffocating nine villagers. In a village under Daxing County, 20 *shi* of grain were looted in one instance. On the 28th, more than 80 innocent people were arrested in a village in Sangyuan, Anci. Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities have aroused boundless resentment among the people and demonstrated great people's integrity. When the bandit troops were robbing in Leshan Village, Xiong County, an old lady in her seventies scolded loudly: "You bastards!..." A bandit stabbed her with a bayonet, and blood flowed freely, but she continued to scold without stopping. In Jinwuzheng Village, a fifteen-year-old child was captured by bandits and forced to reveal the whereabouts of our staff. He resolutely refused to say, and the bandit soldiers stabbed him twice, but he still said nothing. Zhang Youcai, a farmer from Sencun Village in the county, was beaten half to death by the bandit soldiers, buried in the soil, and then dug out, but in the end, he did not reveal any secrets of our army. Zhang Haoming, a military dependent in Sanshengkou Village, had his stomach pierced by the enemy with a bayonet. The bandit soldiers asked him why he let his son become a Eighth Route Army soldier. He resolutely said, "To fight against Old Chiang."

　　伟大的人民气节！
  　不畏蒋匪残暴拷打杀戮冀中农民坚不吐露军情
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】上月二十四日至三十日，蒋匪十六军二十二师及六十二军九十五师向平津保三角地区进行“扫荡”时，竟在永清县之龙虎庄施放毒气，熏死村民九人。大兴县属某村一次即被抢走粮食二十石。二十八日在安次桑园某村抓走无辜群众八十余人。蒋匪此种暴行，更激起人民的无比愤恨。并表现了伟大的人民气节。当匪军在雄县乐善庄抢劫时，一七十多岁老太婆大骂道：“好王八蛋们！………”匪一刺刀向她挑去，鲜血直流，但她仍骂不绝口。津武正村一十五岁小孩被匪捉住逼问我工作人员住处，他坚决不说，匪军刺他两刺刀，他还是一点未说。该县森村农民张有才被匪军打得死去活来，用土埋起又刨出，最后还是没有暴露我军一点秘密。三圣口村军属张豪明被敌用刺刀穿破了肚子，匪军问他为什么叫儿子当八路？他坚决地说：“为了打老蒋”。
