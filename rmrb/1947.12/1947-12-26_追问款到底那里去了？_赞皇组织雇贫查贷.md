　　Where Did the Loan Money Go?
　　Zanhuang Organizes Poor Peasants to Investigate Loans
    [Our Newspaper Zanhuang News] During this spring's loan distribution, due to a top-down task-oriented perspective, many loans failed to support poor people, and some villages even helped landlords. The reasons for this error are: (1) At that time, the loans were distributed through cooperatives. Some cooperative cadres had not been thoroughly reformed, and some landlords were still acting as cadres, not taking responsibility for the loans. For example, Li Xinnian, a poor peasant and military dependent from Chengxi Street, wanted to borrow several thousand yuan from the cooperative. He spoke many good words to the cadre, but he didn't get the loan. (2) When distributing the loans, the county first determined the amount to be distributed to each district, and each district determined the amount to be distributed to each village based on the village's wealth. However, many villages were careless when distributing the loans. For example, in Beiyangjiao Village, the loan distribution was simply announced at a cadre meeting: "Which poor households want to borrow money?" But then they said: "Those who borrow money must find a guarantor to ensure repayment on time." As a result, poor peasants did not dare to borrow money. Of the 400,000 yuan in spring plowing loans in the village, only 16 out of 40 poor households borrowed 130,500 yuan. Landlord Shang Lanzhou and Lan Fengqi in Zhaizi Village also repaid more than 20,000 yuan in loans. In addition, some village cadres and militiamen, under the pretext of engaging in sideline occupations, controlled large amounts of loans. After these situations were discovered, the leadership was shocked and first made a profound self-criticism, believing that it was a task-oriented perspective from the county to the district, thinking that "the matter was over once the allocation was made to the village." Strict inspections were not carried out during production. After the self-criticism, it was decided to emphasize the importance of loan work to cadres at all levels and to mobilize poor peasants to investigate and re-lend loans. This work has already begun, and some villages have achieved results and created experience: 1. Hold forums for poor peasants to inspire their loan requests through discussions on how to overcome famine through production. For example, in Beiyangjiao Village, during the discussion, everyone felt that they lacked capital, and then asked, "Where did the village's loans go?" From then on, the problems in the loan distribution were exposed. Then it was proposed: We should control our own loans! This mobilized other poor peasants to organize a loan committee to discuss who should borrow and who should not, resulting in the recovery of 300,500 yuan, which was re-lent to poor people. 2. Combine the distribution of new loans with the mobilization of poor peasants to investigate old loans. For example, when distributing new loans in Zhaizi Village, because there were not enough to allocate, they promptly inspired poor peasants to investigate the old loan households, and also found that many households had been improperly loaned. After being returned, they were re-lent. 3. Combine loans with the organization of production. For example, ten poor peasant women in Nanzhuli, after obtaining loans, combined them with some private funds and organized a textile group. In 55 days, they earned 178,000 yuan, not only finding a proper use for the loans, but also developing mutual aid groups. (Yù Bǎo)

### 追问款到底那里去了？　赞皇组织雇贫查贷

　　追问款到底那里去了？
  　赞皇组织雇贫查贷
    【本报赞皇讯】今春贷款时，由于自上而下的任务观点，致使好些贷款没有扶持了贫苦群众，个别村并曾帮助了地主。这种错误形成之原因：（一）当时通过合作社来发放，有些村社干部未经过彻底改造，仍有地主当着干部，对贷款不负责任。如城西街雇贫军属李新年想到合作社贷几千元的款，见了干部，说了多少好话，结果没贷下。（二）发放时，县里首先确定各区发放数目，各区根据各村穷富，确定数目发到村内，但好些村在发放贷款时很马虎。如北羊角村，在发放贷款时，只是干部大会上宣布了一下：“贫苦户谁贷款？”但接着就说：“贷款要找保人，保证到期归还。”这样一来，贫苦农民想贷款也不敢贷了。该村春耕贷款四十万元，雇贫四十户中只有十六户贷款十三万零五百元。寨里村地主商兰州兰凤其也还贷款两万多元。另外，还有个别村干、民兵，借口搞副业，掌握着大批贷款。这些情况发现后，领导上大吃一惊，首先作了深刻的检讨，认为是从县到区的任务观点，以为“分配到村就算大事完毕了”。在生产当中，也未严格的检查。经检讨后，决定强调各级干部重视贷款工作，发动雇贫查贷转贷。现已开始进行，有些村已做出成绩，并创造了经验：一、召开贫农座谈会，从讨论如何生产渡荒中启发其贷款要求。如北羊角村，在讨论中，大家感到没资本，即提出“村里贷款那里去了”？从此，就扯出贷款中的问题来。随即提出：自己的贷款应当自己掌握！这样一提，又动员了其他雇贫，组织了贷款委员会，讨论谁该贷，谁不该贷，结果收回了卅万零五千元，转贷给贫苦群众。二、结合发放新贷款，发动雇贫进行检查旧贷款。如寨里村在发放新贷款时，因不够分配，即抓紧启发雇贫对旧贷款户进行检查，也查出好些户贷的不适当。退回后转贷了。三、结合贷款组织生产。如南竹里十户贫农妇女，得到贷款后，又结合了一部分私款，组织了一个纺织组，五十五天赚洋十七万八千元，不但贷款找到了正当用途，而且发展了互助组。　　　　　　　　　　（玉宝）
