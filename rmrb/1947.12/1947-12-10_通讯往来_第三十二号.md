　　Communications and Exchanges

　　No. 32

　　To Comrades Correspondents in Various Regions:

　　The winter production campaign has begun successively in various places. Changzhi, Gaoyi, Pingshun, Shahe and other places have already achieved preliminary results. Please vigorously report on the organization of winter production in various places. Are poor peasants and hired laborers the backbone leadership controlling the mass-based sideline mutual aid groups? Report on all kinds of production achievements and experiences in textile, transportation, workshops, collecting mountain products, etc., whatever can be done. Is the leadership left to drift? Are the production conditions of the poor and hired laborers satisfied (tools, funds, mastery and improvement of production technology, etc.)? Has the cooperative become the core of supporting small-scale social production? Are the industrial and commercial and trade departments actively regulating the market and promoting products? Also, please promptly reflect on issues or examples such as the masses collecting firewood in large quantities, accumulating fertilizer, purchasing agricultural tools and livestock to prepare for next year's major production.

　　To Comrades in the Jiaozuo City Office and Wang Ruzhen, Lian Zhizhong and others:

　　The experience you reported on protecting grain and ensuring labor in the Jiaozuo urban area, such as continuous active attacks, giving equal importance to political offensives and armed strikes, obtaining the activity patterns of the enemy and puppets at any time, carrying out large-scale landmine explosions combined with sniping (to make the enemy panic), joint defense operations with assistance arriving from all directions when one place is attacked, and armed in-depth political offensives behind enemy lines and burying flying mines, are all examples for the current struggle against the enemy in various border areas. I hope to continue to report in depth. In addition, please promptly reflect on matters such as the establishment of landmine training classes, the rotation training of poor peasant and hired laborer militias, the mass-based active storage of grain and preparation for war, village-by-village defense, and the struggle stories of the Yang Juhe and other rotation teams.

　　To Comrades in the Anyang Office:

　　Please promptly report on the development of the 100,000 landmine campaign in your county and the process, achievements, and experiences of reviewing the militia and arming them under the control of poor peasants and hired laborers.

　　通讯往来
  　第三十二号各地通讯员同志：
    冬季生产运动已先后开始，长治、高邑、平顺、沙河等地，并已初步获得成绩。请大力报导各地冬季生产的组织情形，是否贫雇为骨干领导掌握群众性的副业互助组？报导纺织、运输、作坊、采山货等啥能干干啥的种种生产成绩和经验。领导上是否自流？是否满足了贫雇生产条件（工具、资金、掌握与提高生产技术等）？合作社是否成为扶植小型社生产核心？工商、贸易部门是否积极调剂市场、推销产品？以及群众大量打柴、积肥、购置农具、牲口准备明年大生产等问题或范例都望及时反映。焦作市办公室及王汝珍、连志中诸同志：
    你们所报导焦作市区护粮、保丁经验：如连续主动出击，政攻与武装打击并重，随时获得敌伪活动规律、展开大规模地雷结合冷枪乱枪（使敌慌乱）的爆炸运动，一处打响四处驰援的联防作战，武装深入敌后开展政攻与埋飞雷等都是目前各边地对敌斗争的范例，希连续深入报导。此外，关于开办地雷训练班，轮训贫雇民兵，群众性主动藏粮备战、村村设防，以及杨聚和等轮战队的斗争故事之类，均请及时反映。安阳办公室同志：
    请及时报导你县十万地雷运动开展情形以及审查民兵、武装由贫雇掌握的经过、成绩和经验。
