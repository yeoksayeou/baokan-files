    Border Government and Financial Office Support Poor and Hired Laborers' Winter Production
    Distributing 350 Million Winter Loans
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to meet the production needs of the poor and hired laborers and solve their capital difficulties, the Border Government and the Financial Office have decided to increase the issuance of 350 million in winter production loans for poor and hired laborers. The general office of the Ji'nan Bank has instructed its branches to quickly distribute these loans. In addition to the 500 million in production loans issued in the previous quarter, the current increase is allocated as follows: 70 million for the Taiyue District, 50 million for the Taihang District, 100 million for the Ji'nan District, and 130 million for the Ji-Lu-Yu District. Key points of the instructions: (1) This winter's new loans must be fully guaranteed to be lent to poor and hired farmers to solve the difficulties in winter sideline production and lay the foundation for large-scale production next spring. (2) Loans should be reviewed and issued through poor and hired labor groups or production organizations (mutual aid teams or cooperatives) led by poor and hired laborers, and they should be responsible for recovering the loans on time. Banks must transfer a large number of cadres to participate in the issuance work together with Party, government, and civilian cadres, go deep into the poor and hired laborers to understand the situation, and correct deviations in a timely manner. (3) The combination of loans and labor can create abundant capital for the masses. Combined with the floating wealth obtained by the poor and hired laborers in the land reform, accelerate capital turnover, mainly relying on the masses themselves to "diligently turn over." Each loan recipient should turn over two to three times in winter. Those who have not solved their difficulties can extend the loan period. Do not mechanically restrict the use of funds, and at the same time prevent waste. (4) Special care should be given to poor and hired laborers in disaster areas and areas with poor harvests. Do not emphasize taking care of anti-Japanese, industrial, or revolutionary martyrs' families or cadres; the decision should be made by the masses themselves. (5) New loans should not be forcibly issued in areas where poor and hired farmers have not truly taken charge and various organizations are not well-equipped. (6) Loans previously granted to non-poor and hired laborers should be gradually recovered and re-lent to poor and hired farmers. Currently, cadres at all levels of the bank are concentrating all their efforts to guide this work. (Zhou Yizhong)

    边府、财办扶植贫雇冬季生产
    发放冬贷卅五万万
    【本报讯】为满足贫雇生产要求，解决其资本困难，边府、财办决定增发冬季贫雇生产贷款三十五万万，冀南银行总行并已指示各区分支行，迅速发放此项贷款。除前季全区生产贷款五十万万外，现增加发放者计太岳区七万万，太行区五万万，冀南区十万万，冀鲁豫区十三万万。该指示要点：（一）今冬新增贷款，必须保证全部贷给贫雇农，解决冬季副业生产困难，奠定明春大生产基础。（二）贷款应经过贫雇小组，或贫雇当家的生产组织（互助组或合作社），由他们评议发放，由他们按期收回，银行必须抽调大批干部，协同党、政、民干部亲自参加发放工作，深入贫雇了解情况，及时纠正偏向。（三）贷款与劳力结合，才能创造群众的丰厚资本，结合贫雇在土改中得到的浮财，加速资金周转，主要靠群众自己“勤翻腾”，冬季每一贷户做到翻腾两次到三次，没有解决困难者可以延长贷款期限。不要机械限制用途，同时防止浪费现象。（四）对灾区及歉收区的贫雇，应加以特别照顾，不要强调照顾抗、工、烈属或干部，应由群众自己决定。（五）新增贷款在贫雇农尚未真正当家，各种组织没有配备好的地区，不要勉强发放。（六）以前贷款对象非贫雇者，应逐渐收回转贷到贫雇农手中。现银行各级干部正集中全力指导这一工作。  （周义中）
