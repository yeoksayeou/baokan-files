　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits and Landlords Cruelly Exploit
    Farmers in the Chiang Kai-shek Areas Suffer Terribly
  　Toiling All Year Round Only to End Up Cold and Hungry
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] The increasingly improved lives of farmers in the Northeast Liberated Areas, where tillers own their land, stand in stark contrast to the suffering of farmers in the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China. According to a Shenyang dispatch in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on November 26, regarding the惨状 of the countryside in the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China: the suffering of the farmers is truly endless, with numerous levies and complicated collections. Due to the Chiang bandits' frenzied conscription, strong laborers are fleeing to the cities. Old men in their forties and fifties are replacing young men in their twenties and thirties to cultivate the land, resulting in a shortage of rural labor. Due to the continuous devaluation of Chiang currency, landlords are converting rent payments from currency to goods, and operating landlords are also trying to rent out their land. Under the dual exploitation of Chiang bandits and landlords, ordinary farmers are suffering from hunger and cold, and winter rice has become a problem, with next spring being even more difficult to get through. Grain and grass are too expensive, and farmers cannot afford to feed their cattle in the winter, so they are selling and slaughtering them, with beef being much cheaper than pork. Farmers toil all year round without getting enough to eat, resulting in low interest in production, reluctance to fertilize, and inability to improve agricultural tools. According to this year's crop conditions, land that could yield eight shi per mu only yielded five shi, resulting in a serious reduction in agricultural production in the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China this year. The Chiang bandits' levies are even more painful for the farmers than the "Gedang" (meaning proportional allocation based on income) of the Japanese puppet era. The "Gedang" of the Japanese puppet era was allocated proportionally, but now the power is in the hands of the Chiang bandit village offices controlled by the landlords. The village chiefs can arbitrarily decide who pays more and who pays less, and all burdens fall on the poor farmers who have no money or power. Ordinary farmers feel that their current lives are even more painful than under the rule of the Japanese.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] Farmers in the Chiang-occupied areas of eastern Hebei are burdened with heavy taxes and are suffering miserably. According to a Fengrun dispatch in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on October 31: This year's autumn harvest in eastern Hebei averages no more than five dou of grain per mu (based on corn, equivalent to 220 jin). The cost of production per mu from sowing to harvest is: one sheng of seeds (4.4 jin), one cart of fertilizer and manure, worth one dou of corn (44 jin), labor wages and food costs totaling one and a half dou of corn (66 jin), and livestock power worth half a dou of corn (22 jin), totaling 136.4 jin. Subtracting the production costs from the production volume leaves a surplus of 83.6 jin. However, the Chiang bandits' various exorbitant taxes and levies amount to about three dou per mu (132 jin). After the farmers hand over all their hard-earned income to the Chiang bandits, they are still short 48.4 jin per mu.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] Tianjin News: Farmers in Jinghai County, north of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, are groaning under the disasters caused by Chiang Kai-shek and natural calamities. This year, the county suffered from spring drought and autumn floods, with 15 townships and 127 villages, covering approximately 228,980 mu, affected by waterlogging and flooding. The total harvest for the year was only 20% of a normal year. However, the Chiang bandits have not reduced their bone-scraping land taxes and levies in the slightest. Recently, the Chiang bandit police in the county levied 420 million Chiang currency for winter clothing expenses in one lump sum, and the disaster victims repeatedly pleaded for exemption but were rejected by the Chiang bandits.

　　蒋匪与地主残酷榨取
    蒋区农民痛苦万状
  　辛劳终年落个饥寒交迫
    【新华社陕北五日电】实现了耕者有其田的东北解放区农民生活日益向上与东北蒋占区农民的痛苦形成强烈的对照。据天津大公报十一月二十六日沈阳通讯报导东北蒋占区农村惨状称：农民的苦况实在说不尽，摊派多、征收繁。由于蒋匪的疯狂抓丁，壮丁纷纷逃入都市。四五十岁的老头子代替了二、三十岁的小伙子耕作，农村劳动力缺乏。由于蒋币不断贬值，地主纷纷将钱租改为实物，经营地主亦均设法将土地租出。在蒋匪与地主双重榨取下，一般农民饥寒交迫，冬米已成问题，明春将更无法渡过。粮草太贵，农民冬季养不活耕牛，纷纷将牛出卖宰杀，牛肉比猪肉贱得多。农民终岁辛劳不得一饱，生产兴趣低落，懒于施肥，更无法改良农具。按今年年景，一亩地可以打八石的也只打了五石，造成东北蒋占区农村今年的严重减产。蒋匪摊派比日满时代的“割当”（按收入分届摊派之意）更使农民痛苦，日伪时代的“割当”是按比例分摊，如今大权操在由地主把持的蒋匪村公所手中，谁多摊谁少派，保长可以随意支配，一切负担都落到无钱无势的贫苦农民身上。一般农民都感觉到现在的生活，比日满统治时代更为痛苦。
    【新华社陕北五日电】冀东蒋占区农民负担繁重，痛苦不堪。据十月三十一日天津大公报丰润通讯报导：本年冀东秋收每亩地平均产粮不过五斗（以玉米为准，合二百二十市斤）每亩地由下种到收获的生产费，计种子一升（四．四市斤），肥料土粪一车，值玉米一斗（四十四市斤），人工工资，饭费合玉米斗半（六十六市斤），牲畜力值玉米半斗（二十二市斤），共计一百三十六．四市斤，由生产量减去生产费还剩余八十三．六市斤。但蒋匪各种苛杂摊派每亩地即达三斗左右（一百三十二市斤）。农民辛劳所得，全部交与蒋匪外，每亩地仍不敷四十八．四市斤。
    【新华社陕北五日电】津报讯：津浦北段静海县农民辗转呻吟蒋祸天灾之下。该县今年春旱秋涝，受水灾及涝灾者，达十五乡一百二十七村，约廿二万八千九百八十余亩，全年收获仅及半年的二成。但蒋匪敲骨吃髓的田赋及摊派丝毫未减。最近该县蒋匪警察冬季服装费一次摊派即达蒋币四亿二千万元，灾民数度哀求豁免均被蒋匪所拒。
