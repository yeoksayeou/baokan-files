Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Reports from various sources: The Soviet Union's implementation of currency reform and the abolition of the rationing system have become the top news stories shaking the world in recent days. Most newspapers in various countries have published this news in prominent positions. Almost all newspapers in the New Democratic countries have published the full text of Stalin's order and written articles praising it. Many Czech newspapers have compared the Soviet Union's move with Truman's recent statement that the United States is preparing to implement rationing. The "Rude Pravo" newspaper editorial pointed out: "Only a country that does not want war and believes in its own strength can take such measures that are obviously aimed at long-term development;" and called on the Czech people to follow the Soviet example, work hard, so that the Czech Republic can also abolish the rationing system as soon as possible. The Austrian Montag newspaper also wrote an article pointing out: The Soviet Union has eliminated the scourge of war and completely turned to a peaceful economy. The British "Daily Worker" newspaper, in its editorial, warmly congratulated the Soviet people, and said: "The British people have already shared the benefits of the great achievements of socialism (note: this refers to the Soviet Union's decision to provide food aid to Britain in the recent Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations), therefore, there is ample reason to share the joy of the Soviet people." The editorial also emphasized: This reform proves that the Soviet Union's power is incomparably huge. Some bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Britain, due to the extreme importance of this news, had to mark it with huge headlines, but they tried their best to shorten the news itself and distort it, in an attempt to dilute the reader's impression.

　　改革币制废除配给证明苏联力量强大
  　世界各国报纸同声称羡
    【新华社陕北十九日电】各方讯：苏联实行改革货币与废除配给制，连日来已成为轰动世界之头号新闻，各国大多数报纸均以显要地位刊载此项消息，新民主主义国家几乎所有报纸均登出斯大林命令之全文，并撰论赞扬。捷克报纸多以苏联此举与杜鲁门最近声明美国准备实行配给一事相对比。“鲁德·布拉窝”报社论指出：“只有不愿意战争而相信自身力量之国家，才能采取此种显然着眼于长远发展之举措；”并呼吁捷克人民追随苏联之范例，努力工作，使捷克亦能及早取消配给制。奥地利蒙塔格报，亦撰论指出：苏联业已清除战争之流毒，而完全转入和平经济。英国工人日报在其社论中，对苏联人民热烈庆贺，并称：“英国人民已分沾社会主义伟大成就之利益（按此系指苏联在最近英苏贸易谈判中，已决定以粮食援英而言），因此，实有充分理由分享苏联人民之欢愉。”社论亦强调：此种改革，证明苏联力量为无比巨大。美英若干资产阶级报纸，因此项新闻之极端重要性，不能不标以巨大之头号标题，但对新闻本身则竭力使之缩短，并予以歪曲，图以此冲淡读者之印象。
