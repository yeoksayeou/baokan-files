Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 4th: A certain sub-district in Beiyue thoroughly carried out a clean-up of housekeeping, cleansing corruption and embezzlement. The sub-district leaders personally went deep into the companies for inspection tours, discovering many cases of embezzlement. For example, during the reconnaissance conference, it was discovered that a certain intelligence station had embezzled over 5 million yuan in fines and engaged in unauthorized transportation and sales, as well as "eating empty quotas," among other serious phenomena. At the military communications conference, after eight days of inspection, it was discovered that Yan, the deputy chief of the communications section, had privately fined 1 million yuan in Zhengding and Jingxing, and had also stolen and sold communications equipment (galvanized iron, iron wire, etc.) worth over 2.93 million yuan. He privately retained merchants to do business without going through the organization, earning a profit of 600,000 yuan, of which cadres privately divided over 100,000 yuan each, resulting in a shortage of over 2,000 catties of millet for food. In order to conceal this from higher authorities, Huo, the political instructor of the team, even led the alteration of accounts. All the above-mentioned offenders are currently under investigation. The departments of Justice, Politics, and Supply also organized working groups. At the end of September, a responsible comrade personally led them to various units for more than ten days of inspection, and serious violations of policy such as private transportation and sales, theft and embezzlement of spoils of victory were discovered. Among them, a certain battalion alone had more than ten privately established workshops and businesses. Sun Yuanpei, the supply officer of the battalion, in addition to opening a charcoal factory in Pingshan, further used his position to deduct over 16 million yuan in vegetable money from various companies for private business operations. Over a period of four months, 46 large shi of privately stored millet were found in just one pharmacy and one restaurant he opened in Mashan. The offender has now been handed over to the military court for legal proceedings. In addition, the huge deposits accumulated from the sale of spoils of victory by the First and Second Companies of a certain regiment have been confiscated and turned over to the public. Also, in certain units, a large number of individual and small unit "small safes" were found. All illegal materials that were discovered have been confiscated and turned over to the public. Currently, the sub-district has received a total of over 220 million yuan in border currency, 64,022 catties of millet, and 4,473 catties of wheat in illegal materials and offered savings from various units.
