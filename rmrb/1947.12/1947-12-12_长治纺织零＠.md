    Changzhi Textile Zero @
    Worn Felt Cloth
    Exchanged for New Clothes
    Li Jinzhi from Wangqing Village was a poor woman who fled from Huguan. Her whole family of seven had no clothes to wear and were covered with pitiful worn felt cloth. Li Aijing then went to mobilize her to participate in textile production. She said, "I have three small children. If I leave, there will be no one to cook and sew for them." Later, Li Aijing took her to the group to see everyone weaving, listened to everyone calculating accounts and dividing dividends, which aroused Jinzhi's interest. Aijing also calculated accounts with her individually and mobilized her three times before she agreed to participate. Aijing also seized on the pitiful fact that her children were wearing worn felt cloth to slowly break through Jinzhi's thinking and got her to join the textile group.

    When she started learning to weave, she was very clumsy. Jinzhi was both shy and afraid that the thread would not become cloth. Aijing knew her worries and used the thread she spun as weft, and said: "For a beginner, spinning thread like this is really good." This gave Jinzhi even more enthusiasm for weaving, and she earned two zhang of cloth in half a month. Jinzhi was also afraid that the group would not let her draw cloth. Aijing discussed it with the whole group and allowed her to take a zhang and a half of cloth first to make new clothes for the three children, and the remaining five chi were used as shares for production. Her mother-in-law and husband praised her for being good when they saw the children in new clothes. Now Jinzhi has become an active backbone of textile production in Wangqing Village.

    Five Balls of Cotton
    Promoting the Large Spinning Wheel
    When the higher authorities called for the promotion of large spinning wheels, Wangqing bought one first, but most people were not used to it and were unwilling to use it. Li Heimao, a textile model worker, was the first to experiment with using a large spinning wheel to spin cotton. At first, he only spun three or four liang a day, but in less than half a month, he became skilled and could spin ten liang of cotton every day. Under his influence, young women such as Li E’ze began to use large spinning wheels. But some women did not quite believe it, such as An Ze's wife and Yin Hu's wife, who said, "The large spinning wheel is not as good as the small wheel. Spinning ten liang a day is just the cadres bragging." Guo Fei’ze, the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association, and Jin Qi's wife, after hearing this, thought of ways to break through these people's thinking. The next day, they moved a large spinning wheel and competed with them in spinning cotton, five balls of cotton each, to see who could spin the fastest. As a result, the large spinning wheel finished spinning the five balls of cotton, while the small wheel only spun two. Yin Hu's wife said, "In the past, I was afraid that the large spinning wheel would be expensive and difficult to use, but now I see clearly that the small wheel spins four liang a day, while the large spinning wheel easily spins half a jin. Using the large spinning wheel, I can spin seven and a half jin more cotton a month. It is still more profitable to use the large spinning wheel." Now the whole village has developed to one hundred and twenty wheels.

    Carefully Calculate the Deficit
    Weaving is a Must
    The Li Spinning Group in Loudi Village, Fifth District of Changzhi, has six women. After the autumn harvest, they all thought that they had harvested so much grain and vegetables that they didn't have to worry about going hungry. Some said, "After working so many days, shouldn't we rest for a while?" Li Fanghua then held a meeting to calculate accounts for everyone. She first started calculating for her own family. Her family of two and a half people (one small child) harvested sixteen shi and five dou of coarse grain. Including hiring workers, they had to eat seven shi and seven dou and five sheng throughout the year, pay public grain and grind one shi and eight gu, eat salt equivalent to a shi of grain throughout the year, burn coal equivalent to one shi and five of grain, and pay wages equivalent to four shi and two dou. Not counting miscellaneous expenses, they would need sixteen shi and two dou and five sheng. Everyone then started calculating their accounts. Zhao Suye said: "Thinking of the pain during the famine aroused everyone's awareness, and everyone said: 'Chairman Mao led us to turn over. Now that we have harvested a few grains, we forget the hundred famines after one full meal. We must seize the opportunity to weave.'" The whole group immediately discussed the division of labor. Zhao Suyuan's group weaved two zhang of cloth a day, and the remaining five women spun two jin of thread every day. Now they are working very hard. (Cheng Shouchuang, Niu Pangzi, Kang Shude)

    长治纺织零＠
    毛连破毡片
    换成三表新
    王庆村李金枝，是从壶关逃难上来的贫苦妇女，全家七口人，身上没衣穿，披挂的毛连毡片，很是可怜。李爱景便去发动她参加纺织，她说：“家有三个小娃娃，我一走就连做饭缝补的人也没有了。”后来李爱景就引她到组里去看大家纺织，听大家算帐分红利，引逗的金枝心活了，爱景又和她个别算帐，动员她三趟她都不参加，又抓住她小孩披毛连里毡片的可怜事实，慢慢才打通了金枝思想，参加了纺织组。
    开始学纺，很粗笨，金枝又害羞又怕线织不成布，爱景知道她这心事，便把她纺的线做了纬线，还说：初学纺线就纺成这样可不歪。这样金枝的纺织劲头更大了，半个月赚了二丈布。金枝又怕组里不让她抽布，爱景又和全组商议，给她先取了丈五布，给三个小娃换上了新衣服，剩下五尺教作股金生产。她婆婆、男人见小孩换上了新衣服，都夸她好，现在金枝已成了王庆村纺织的积极骨干了。
    五个花圪卷
    推广大轮车
    上级号召推广大轮车时，王庆就先买了一辆，但大部分都不习惯不愿用，纺织模范李黑毛，首先试验用大轮车纺花。一开始每天只纺三四两，不到半月就手熟了，每天能纺十两花。在他影响下，就有李娥则等青年妇女都用开大轮车了。但还有一部分妇女不大相信，如安则媳妇、银虎老婆等都说：“大轮车不如小车子好使，一天纺十两是干部们胡吹哩。”妇救主席郭肥则和金起媳妇一听这话，便想办法去打通这些人的思想，第二天搬上大轮车和她们到一块比赛纺花，每人五个花圪卷，看谁纺的快。结果大轮车把五个花圪卷纺完了，小车才纺两个。银虎老婆说：“从前我怕大轮车贵、不好使，现在可看清楚了，小车子一天纺四两，大轮车一天松松纺半斤。用大轮车一月就多纺七斤半花，还是用大轮车得利大。”现全村已发展到一百二十辆。
    仔细算窟窿
    不纺可不行
    长治五区楼底村李纺花组，有六个妇女，秋收后，都以为粮食蔬菜收了这样多，可不怕饿肚了。有的说：“干了这多天还不休息一个时期”？李纺花便开会给大家算帐，她先开始算了自己家，家有两口半人（一个小娃娃），打了十六石五斗粗粮，连雇工人全年得吃用七石七斗五，交公粮碾了石八谷，全年吃盐得石数粮，烧煤得石五粮，工资出了四石二斗，不算零碎开消就得十六石二斗五。跟着大家都算开了帐。赵素叶说：想起灾荒时的痛苦，更引起了大家的觉悟，一齐说：毛主席领导咱翻了身，眼前打了几颗粮食，一饱就忘了百饥，不抓紧纺织可不行。当下全组研究分工，赵素员组一天织成布两丈，其余五个妇女，每天纺二斤线，现在干的很带劲。（程守创、牛胖子、康树德）
