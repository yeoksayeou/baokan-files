Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. Ma Hongkui's bandit troops and local militias entrenched in the Ningtiaoliang town of Sanbian in northern Shaanxi, intimidated by the might of our army, abandoned the town and fled west to Anbian city at midnight on November 25th. On the 29th at dusk, they fled west again from Anbian, and were pursued by our army. In addition to inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, over sixty prisoners were captured alive. Anbian city and Ningtiaoliang town were thus recovered by our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. Medical workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are serving the wounded with enthusiasm, loyalty, and diligence, and a group of model workers and meritorious individuals have emerged. Medical orderly Huo Fengming went deep into the front lines with the combat troops, braving the hail of bullets and carrying the wounded to the mountain gullies to bandage their wounds. Even when enemy grenades exploded in front of him, he did not stop his rescue work. Medical orderly Fang Sendong threw grenades at the enemy, and used the spreading dust and smoke to carry wounded soldiers back from the front lines. Liberation Army medical orderly Li Lingxiao voluntarily stayed with a certain squad of combat troops to cover the transportation of the wounded, continuing to carry the wounded off the front lines until the last one was evacuated. Doctor Gao Wanmin, along with three others, established a wounded soldier transfer station in the war zone. Doctor Gao not only treated the wounded during the day, but also worked the night shift. One person took on the work of a doctor, nurse, and cook. Young nurse Cuixiang was also busy day and night caring for the wounded, and even gave her own cotton quilt to the wounded to cover themselves. After the hospital launched a "blitz nursing" campaign, medical orderly Liu Jingui took on the work of four people. Female doctors Bi Bo, Wang Ying, Jiang Hong and others personally went back and forth carrying the wounded. Under the principle of "surgical treatment of war wounds as the mainstay," the use of medicine has been reduced by 30 to 50 percent, and the mortality rate of the wounded has been reduced to 1.4 percent. 185 medical workers in the hospital have been honored as meritorious individuals, and the entire 19th team of the International Public Welfare Service Association serving on the front lines has also been given a collective commendation.

　　陕北我军收复安边
    西北医务工作者辛勤服务伤员死亡率不到百分之二
    【新华社西北二日电】盘据陕北三边宁条梁镇之马鸿逵匪军及地方团队，慑于我军声威，于十一月二十五日午夜弃城西窜，逃入安边城，二十九日黄昏又由安边西窜，当被我军追击，除予敌军重大杀伤外，生俘六十余名，安边城、宁条梁镇当为我军收复。
    【新华社西北二日电】陕甘宁边区医务工作者热情忠实而艰苦地为伤员服务，出现了一批模范与功臣。卫生员霍凤鸣随战斗部队深入火线，冒着枪林弹雨，背伤员到山沟里包扎伤口，有时甚至敌人手榴弹在他面前爆炸，都未停止救护工作。卫生员房森栋向敌人投掷手榴弹，利用弥漫尘烟从火线上背回伤员，解放战士卫生员李伶孝自动留在战斗部队某班掩护运送伤员，直把最后一个伤员背下火线为止，医生高万民随同三人在战地设立伤员转运站。高医生不仅白天为伤员救治，晚上还值夜班。一人担当了医生、护士、炊事员的三种工作。青年女护士翠香，也是昼夜忙碌看护伤员，并把自己棉被给伤员盖。该院展开“突击护理”运动后，卫生员刘金桂一人担任四人工作，女医生毕波、王瑛、江洪等亲自往来抬运伤员，在“战伤外科治疗为主”原则下，用药已减少百分之三十至五十，伤员死亡率减低到百分之一点四，该院已有一百八十五位医务工作者荣任为功臣，在前线服务之国际公谊服务会第十九队亦全体记功一次。
