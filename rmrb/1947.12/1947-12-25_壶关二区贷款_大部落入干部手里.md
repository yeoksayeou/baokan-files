　　Huguan Second District Loans
  　Large Portions Fall into the Hands of Cadres
    [Report from this newspaper in Huguan] The Second District's new and old loans totaled 3.1 million yuan. Inspections in each sub-district revealed that 70% had not been lent to hired and poor peasants, but mostly fell into the hands of cadres. For example, in Qin Village, out of a loan of 130,000 yuan, the public security officer borrowed 60,000 yuan to open a tofu shop within a mutual aid group. The political director borrowed 40,000 yuan to buy livestock, and the logistics officer invested 30,000 yuan in a flour mill. In Huangshan, a loan of 500,000 yuan was controlled by sixteen cadres, some used it for cooperative shares, some for miscellaneous expenses, and some bought livestock. Even poor women facing difficulties spinning cotton could not get help. Some of the funds were still lent to groups, teams, and workshops. For example, Dongguishan borrowed 100,000 yuan and used it to buy nine pigs for a flour mill. Hedeng borrowed 100,000 yuan and distributed it to four large teams, 25,000 yuan per team, for collective transportation. Some funds were nominally lent to hired and poor peasants, and the names of several hired peasant and military dependents were used, merely informing the individuals, with some even unaware. For example, Songbao borrowed 100,000 yuan and put it into the cooperative, using the names of twenty military dependent households, 5,000 yuan per household, and these households didn't care about the matter. Some village cadres simply put the money into the cooperative for business, such as the 50,000 yuan in Niuwangling, which was never lent out. Currently, all district cadres are going deep into villages to further inspect the loans and correct these phenomena that violate the interests of the masses.

　　壶关二区贷款
  　大部落入干部手里
    【本报壶关讯】二区新旧贷款共三百一十万元，各小区检查，发现百分之七十未贷到雇贫手里，大部都贷到干部手里。如秦庄贷款十三万元，公安员贷款六万元在互助组里开了一个豆腐铺，政治主任贷款四万元买了牲口，后勤贷款三万元投资到粉坊。黄山贷款五十万元，由十六名干部支配了，有的合作社入股，有的杂用，也有的买了牲口，有些贫苦妇女纺花困难也得不到解决。有一部分款仍是贷到组、队、作坊里，如东归善贷款十万元，入到粉坊买猪九个，禾登十万贷款分到四个大队，每队两万五千元，集体去运输。也有些款在名义上是贷给雇贫农，随后按了几户雇贫军属名字，只告诉本人一声，甚至有的户都不知道。如宋堡十万贷款入到合作社，按到二十户军属名字上，每户五千元，这些户都不关心这回事。有的村干脆入到合作社做生意，如牛王岭的五万元就未贷出去。现全体区干部都深入各村，进一步检查贷款，纠正这些违背群众利益的现象。
