(Changzhi News) After inspecting winter production, the Fourth District discovered many important problems. After research, it has now proposed improvement suggestions, requiring the entire district to grasp leadership and quickly launch the winter production movement.

I. Requirements and Principles of Winter Production: From participating in the army to switching to winter production, nearly half a month has passed. Judging from the current situation in the entire district, there are three situations: The first type of village, with poor and hired laborers as the backbone, has organization, leadership, and plans, and has already taken off, including nine villages such as Huo Village. The second type of village, the masses are actively working, some want to work but lack the strength (especially poor and hired peasants), lack plans, leadership is loose, a few are organized, the rest are spontaneous, and the enthusiasm is not high, including fifteen villages such as Henghe. The third type of village, the leadership has no organization, no leadership, the problems of cooperatives, loans, and poor and hired laborers have not been resolved, and the masses generally have complacency and麻痹thought, forming spontaneity and散漫, each taking care of their own production, including fifteen villages such as Pingjia Village. In the thinking of the masses, there are basically two kinds of thought: one is that households that have reached "耕三余一" (enough food for three seasons and surplus for one) have complacency, feel indifferent, and look down on small money. For example, in Xizhuang Village, winter production is doing well, but men look down on women's weaving, relaxing the organization and leadership of weaving, forming a major defect in winter production. The other is that newly emancipated households that have not reached "耕三余一" want to seize the big things, look down on earning small money, are afraid of suffering, do not want to engage in heavy labor such as carrying burdens and transportation, want to sell food to make easy money, want to invest in business, rely on a few skilled people to make money, do not want to go far away, and want to work at their doorstep. For example, in Sangzi, several newly emancipated households do not engage in blacksmithing but look for other easy work to do. There is a general lack of clear thinking about patching up holes and making up for poor harvests, and there is麻痹thought. However, according to this year's harvest in the entire district, it is estimated that 1/10 of households in the entire district, about 900 households, are short of 3 to 7 dou of grain per person. Some villages still let these poor and hired households be spontaneous, the leadership has not solved the specific difficulties of the poor and hired well, has not organized the production of the poor and hired well, has not helped the poor and hired to formulate production plans, and has not paid enough attention to the production of the poor and hired. Based on the above situation, we have decided that the purpose, requirements, and principles of winter production are: to comprehensively develop various winter productions such as sideline occupations, handicrafts, and weaving, to make up for loopholes and poor harvests, and strive to reach "耕三余一"; to break麻痹complacency, and correctly establish the thinking of making up for loopholes and poor harvests. Households that have reached "耕三余一" should overcome complacency, actively produce, increase livestock, develop pigs and sheep, increase fertilizer, and not buy grain for miscellaneous expenses, become rich and richer. Households that have not reached "耕三余一" must break麻痹thought, actively produce, and strive to achieve "耕三余一". District and village cadres must go deep into the loophole households of the newly emancipated, calculate the years to break their麻痹thought, not be afraid of suffering, not dislike earning less money, solve the specific difficulties of the poor and hired in winter production, help the poor and hired formulate production plans, make up for deficits, and strive for each household to earn 7 dou of millet within a month, and the entire district to earn 630 shi of millet within a month.

II. Weaving: Currently, weaving is declining throughout the district, it has not taken off, women have消停thought, do more chores and less weaving, are afraid of trouble, and rely on men. In most villages, weaving is spontaneous, and the leadership has not paid due attention. Some villages have even sold grain to buy cloth, the looms and spinning wheels are stopped, women do chores instead of weaving, and only a few villages have just started to take action. Therefore, a "100 Liang of Cotton per Household per Month" movement needs to be launched in weaving, whether it is a hand-pulled shuttle loom, a flat loom, or a horizontal loom, all must be activated; develop hand-pulled shuttle looms, respect teachers and love apprentices, and improve technology. First of all, carry out a major ideological mobilization, launch a weaving movement to make up for loopholes, not buy grain, not buy cloth, achieve enough to wear, and mobilize women in ideology, so that women truly recognize that labor is glorious, lazy women are shameful, and the weaving movement takes off. Secondly, cultivate poor and hired backbones. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this issue. In this movement, we must take the poor and hired as the backbone, cultivate their leadership, and transform the leadership composition in weaving. Thirdly, carry out competitions and conduct regular inspections. After the movement is launched, in order to make the movement better developed, there must be competitions between villages and between groups, and regular inspections and visits must be held. In the competition, attention must be paid to the improvement of technology, and the improvement of technology must be taken as a competition condition. In terms of organizational form, do not engage in collective weaving, because collectivism can easily cause disputes between weaving women and their families. Our slogans: (1) Do not be麻痹, do not消停, launch a major weaving movement. (2) Hurry up and weave cloth without stopping the machine, rush to wear new clothes for the New Year. (3) Hands do not stop, the wheel rings, and 100 liang must be spun in a month. (4) Spin the yarn evenly and weave the cloth well, mutual aid and exchange of work are called heroes. (5) "耕三余一" must be achieved, and spinning and weaving make up for loopholes.

III. Cooperatives and Loans: The current problems with village cooperatives are that the business direction is not clear, purely for profit, pursuing profits, and not organizing the masses (especially poor and hired peasants) to produce, so they engage in speculative business, the business is small, there are many people detached from production, and the consumption is large. Because it is purely for profit, the masses also owe a lot of debts. Cooperatives do not lend to the masses (especially poor and hired peasants), but use the loans to do speculative business themselves, and do not repay the loans when they are due. In the future, cooperatives must constantly clarify their business direction in action, shift from purely for profit to organizing poor and hired production. Cooperatives with many personnel must be streamlined to reduce expenses; for the debts of the masses, the masses must be mobilized to repay, and some village cadres owe a lot of debts, which should be repaid first. The problem with loans is that the old loans have not been repaid, so new loans cannot be issued. In the past loans, some cooperatives and village cadres borrowed in the name of the masses to invest the loans in cooperatives for speculative business. For example, Cao Fengming, chairman of the Shitan Yu Farmers Association, borrowed 100,000 in the name of the masses and invested it all in cooperative production. This requires each of our district cadres to be responsible for inspecting loans in the villages where they work. Cadres who borrow in the name of others should be handed over to the masses for handling. The dividends obtained from loans for shares should be given to the poor and hired, and procedures should be cleared in time, and the loans should be transferred to the poor and hired peasants (this work should be completed before December 7). In the loan, we must enlighten the poor and hired to realize that the loan is not for乱化, but a fund for production, and at the same time, we must pay attention that the loan cannot be evenly distributed, it must be lent to the poor and hired for proper production, so that the loan can truly play a role in supporting the production of the poor and hired. In the inspection, stubborn bad cooperative cadres should be replaced after this inspection, and the leadership composition of the cooperative should be transformed, so that the cooperative can truly become the core of leading winter production.

　　长治四区检查推动冬季生产
    抓紧领导克服自流
    帮助贫雇订立计划具体解决各种困难
    整顿合作社并检查贷款
    【本报长治讯】四区检查冬季生产以后，发现许多重要问题，现经过研究提出改进意见，要求全区抓紧领导，迅速展开冬季生产运动。
    一、冬季生产的要求和方针：从参军转上冬季生产，到现在将近半月时间，就目前全区的情况来看，有这样三种情况：第一类村庄，以贫雇为骨干，有组织，有领导，有计划，现在已经轰起来的有霍村等九村。第二类村庄，群众积极干，有的想干没力量（特别是贫雇农），没计划，领导松，少数有组织，其余自流，劲头不大，有横河等十五村。第三类村庄，领导上根本没组织，没领导，合作社、贷款、贫雇等问题没有解决，群众思想上普遍的存在自满、麻痹，形成自流散漫，各顾各搞些生产，有平家庄等十五村。在群众的思想上，基本上存在着两种思想情况：一种是达到耕三余一的户，存在着自满思想，觉着满不在乎，看不起小钱。如西庄村，冬季生产搞的不错，但男人看不起妇女的纺织，放松了对纺织的组织领导，形成冬季生产一个很大的缺陷。另一种是新翻身没有达到耕三余一的户，想抓大头，看不起赚小钱，怕受罪，不想搞担挑运输等重生活，想卖饭轻巧取钱，想入股做买卖，靠几个有技术人赚钱，不想出远门，想在家门口边干。如桑梓有几个新翻身户，不打铁，找其他轻巧生活做。普遍对补窟窿、补歉收思想不明确，存在着麻痹思想，但根据今年全区的收成来看，估计全区每口人缺三斗至七斗粮的户占全区户数的十分之一，即九百余户。而有些村庄对这些贫雇不够吃的户仍让其自流，领导上没有很好的解决贫雇的具体困难，没有很好的组织贫雇生产，没有帮助贫雇订生产计划，对贫雇的生产没有足够的注意。根据以上情况，我们决定冬季生产的目的要求和方针是：要全面的开展副业、手工业、纺织等各种冬季生产，补窟窿、补歉收，争取达到耕三余一；打破麻痹自满，正确的树立补窟窿、补歉收思想。达到耕三余一的户，克服自满思想，积极生产，增加牲口，发展猪羊，增加肥料，零星开支不买粮食，发家致富，富了再富。没有达到耕三余一的户，要打破麻痹思想，积极生产，争取做到耕三余一。区村干部要深入新翻身的窟窿户，算年成打破其麻痹思想，不怕受罪，不嫌赚钱少，解决贫雇在冬季生产上的具体困难，帮助贫雇订生产计划，补亏空，争取每户一月内赚小米七斗，全区一月内赚小米六百三十石。
    二、纺织问题：现在就全区来说，纺织是消沉的，没有轰起来，妇女存在着消停思想，打杂多，纺织少，怕麻烦，依靠男人。大部分村庄纺织是自流的，领导上没有应有的注意，甚至有的村庄卖了粮食买布，织机和纺车停着没动，妇女打杂不纺织，只有少数村庄才开始动作。因此，纺织上需要开展一个一户一个月纺织百两花运动，不论手拉梭机、平机、卧机，都动起来；发展手拉梭机，尊师爱徒，提高技术。首先进行思想大动员，开展纺织补窟窿运动，不买粮，不买布，做到够穿，达到在思想上把妇女发动起来，使妇女真正在思想上认识劳动是光荣的，懒妇女是丢人的，把纺织运动轰起来。其次是培养贫雇骨干，过去对这一问题我们没有足够的注意，在这次运动中要以贫雇为骨干，培养他们领导，改造纺织上的领导成份。再次，开展竞赛，定期检查。在运动掀起以后，为使运动更好的开展，必须进行村与村组与组的竞赛，举行定期的检查与参观，在竞赛中必须注意技术的提高，要把技术的提高作为竞赛条件。在组织形式上，不要集体的纺织，因为集体容易使纺织妇女与家庭发生纠纷，我们的口号：（一）不麻痹，不消停，开展纺织大运动。（二）赶快织布不停机，赶住过年穿新衣。（三）手不停，车直响，一月要纺一百两。（四）线子纺匀布织好，互助变工称英豪。（五）耕三余一要达到，纺花织布补窟窿。
    三、合作社和贷款问题：目前村合作社存在的问题是业务方向不明确，单纯营利，追逐利润，不组织群众（特别是贫雇农）生产，所以就做起投机买卖，买卖小，脱离生产人员多，化消大，因为是单纯营利，所以群众欠帐也很大。合作社贷款不贷给群众（特别是贫雇农），自己用贷款做投机生意，贷款到期不还。今后要不断的在行动中让合作社明确业务方向，从单纯营利转到组织贫雇生产，人员多的合作社，要实行精简，减少开支；对群众的欠帐，要发动群众归还，有一部分村干部欠帐不少，应该首先归还。贷款方面存在的问题是旧的贷款没有归还，所以新的贷款也就贷不下去，而在过去的贷款中，有些合作社及村干部，假借群众名义，贷款入合作社做投机买卖。如石炭峪农会主席曹凤鸣，假借群众名义贷款十万，都投入合作社生产。这就须要我们每个区干部同志，负责在工作所在村进行贷款检查，对假借名义贷款的干部，应该交群众处理。贷款入股所得红利，应交给贫雇，及时清理手续，把贷款转给贫雇农（这一工作要在十二月七号以前完成）。贷款中要启发贫雇认识贷款不是叫乱化，是作生产的基金，同时注意贷款不能平均分配，一定贷给贫雇作正当生产，使贷款真正起扶助贫雇生产的作用。在检查中，某些顽抗的坏合作社干部，经过这次检查将其撤换，改造合作社的领导成份，使合作社真正成为领导冬季生产的核心。（四区通讯组）
