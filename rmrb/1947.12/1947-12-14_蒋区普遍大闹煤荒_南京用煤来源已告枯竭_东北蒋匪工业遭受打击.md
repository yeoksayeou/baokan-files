Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 8th: Comprehensive reports indicate that with the arrival of severe winter, the coal shortage in Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas is intensifying. The coal supply to Nanjing, the Chiang bandit capital, originally relied on East China and the Huainan coal mines. East China used to supply 10,000 tons per month, but this was completely stopped in October. Huainan also sharply decreased from 48,000 tons per month to 10,000 tons in October. The transportation industry, factories, and Chiang bandit agencies in Nanjing all feel the severe impact of the coal shortage.

The Northeast Chiang Kai-shek controlled area requires 270,000 tons of coal per month, but the mines in that area could only supply 70,000 tons last month, only a quarter of the area's needs. Even Weng Wenhao, chairman of the Chiang bandit Resources Committee, admitted: "The Northeast not only used to be self-sufficient in coal but could also transport it to other regions; however, now it must rely on the Kailuan coal mine." The coal shortage has forced the tram system in Shenyang to shut down at the beginning of this month, and schools have started their winter vacations early. The entire industrial system of the Northeast Chiang bandits has also suffered a serious blow. A 400-ton iron smelting furnace at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company cannot be started due to the coal shortage. The Changchun Power Plant stopped generating electricity on the 20th of last month due to a lack of coal. The Jinzhou and Jinxi power plants also stopped operating on the 7th of last month because their coal reserves were exhausted and there was no source of supply.

In Taiyuan, under the rule of the Yan bandit, the price of coal had risen to 600,000 yuan per ton at the beginning of last month. Despite entering "Winter Begins," very few merchants and residents can afford to burn fires to heat their rooms. The coal shortage in Datong is also severe, with residents often gathering by the railway tracks to scavenge for coal cinders. The Chiang Kai-shek controlled area of Chahar Province is experiencing a widespread coal shortage, with black market coal in Zhangjiakou also rising to 600,000 yuan per ton. Poor people can only sigh in despair at the sight of coal. Residents of Longguan County in the province are forced to quench their thirst with raw water. Xi'an is experiencing shortages of both coal and grain, which the citizens call the "black and white famines." Due to the severe coal shortage in Qingdao, even the bureaucratic-capitalist China Textile Industries Corporation branch company was forced to cease operations on the 12th.

    蒋区普遍大闹煤荒
    南京用煤来源已告枯竭
    东北蒋匪工业遭受打击
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合各方消息：严冬来临，蒋区各地煤荒益趋深刻化。蒋匪首都南京用煤原赖华东及淮南煤矿供给，华东方面原来每月供给一万吨，至十月份已全部停止供给；淮南亦由每月四万八千吨锐减至十月份之一万吨。南京运输业、工厂及蒋匪各机关均感煤荒严重。东北蒋区每月需煤二十七万吨，但上月份该地各矿仅能供给七万吨，仅及该地需要量之四分之一。即蒋匪资委会委员长翁文灏亦供认：“东北用煤本不仅可以自给，且可外运；但现则需仰赖开滦煤矿。”煤荒已迫使沈阳市内电车于本月初陷于停顿，各学校均提前放寒假。东北蒋匪整个工业体系亦遭严重打击，鞍山钢铁公司一座四百吨熔铁炉，因煤荒无法开动。长春电厂因缺煤于上月二十日起停止发电。锦州、锦西两发电厂亦以存煤用尽，来源无着，于上月七日起停工。阎匪统治下之太原，上月初煤价每吨已涨达六十万元，虽入“立冬”，一般商民及住户能燃火暖室者甚少。大同煤荒亦甚，居民多群集铁道旁争拾煤渣。察省蒋区普遍闹煤荒，张家口黑市煤每吨亦涨六十万元，穷人均只有望煤兴叹。该省龙关县居民均被迫以生水解渴。西安则煤粮均缺，市民称之为“黑白二荒”。青岛因为煤荒严重，连官僚资本之中纺分公司亦被迫于十二日起停工。
