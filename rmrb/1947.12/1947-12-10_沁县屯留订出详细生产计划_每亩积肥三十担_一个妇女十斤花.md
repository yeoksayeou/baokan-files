[This dispatch was sent from] Taiyue, 7th of this month: The winter production committees of Qin County and Tunliu County have separately established winter production plans. Tunliu's winter production plan includes launching a "Ten Jin of Cotton" spinning and weaving campaign for women during the three winter months. The plan requires the five districts of the county to spin 350,000 jin of cotton, weave 2,400,000 chi of cloth, increase 650 shuttle looms, train 1,342 weavers, and increase 222 accelerated spinning wheels. To complete the task, all flat and vertical loom weavers are required to work together. Districts will open large training classes, and villages will open small training classes. In terms of quality, the goal is to spin well and weave well, and specific action slogans have been put forward: "Ten jin of cotton per woman, wealth and prosperity can start at home," "Don't worry about not being able to sell, but worry about the goods not being good." In transportation, in addition to exporting local cloth, mats, and other products to exchange for salt, coal, and livestock, each person must also earn back one shi of millet, each livestock must earn back two shi of rice, and roads must be repaired, shops opened, and 730 head of livestock bought back. In terms of manure accumulation, it must be ensured that each mu receives 40 to 50 loads of manure next year. Six new saltpeter houses will be built, and the original 25 saltpeter houses will be consolidated and expanded. In the work, attention will be paid to poor peasant and hired labor backbones, small cooperatives will be established, and cooperatives that only focus on consumption and profit without organizing mass production will be reformed. Qin County's winter production plan requires 30,000 spinners in the county to launch a 300,000 jin cotton spinning campaign. One shuttle loom should be installed for every 30 households. On the basis of improving old tools, spinning should be even and weaving should be flat, and the old habit of narrow cloth will be resolutely reformed. The slogans "Spin evenly, weave flat, widen the cloth surface for easy promotion" have been put forward. Cooperatives will be responsible for buying and selling 300,000 jin of cotton raw materials and 4,800,000 chi of finished products. In transportation, livestock will mainly be used to haul coal. Each head of livestock should haul twelve times. In addition to solving the burning needs for the first half of next year, coal can also be sold to saltpeter factories. Poor and hired laborers should be organized into groups to carry and sell local cloth, white flour, oil, and other products, and exchange them for necessities. Each person is required to earn 20,000 yuan in foreign currency. In terms of manure accumulation, it will also be guaranteed that each mu will receive more than 30 loads of manure next year. Regarding the issue of buying livestock, each cooperative is required to organize the masses to buy at least three head of livestock. The county government has also notified all villages that livestock bought back from other districts will not be subject to labor service or substitute cultivation for six months, and livestock bought back from other counties will be exempt for three months, in order to overcome the serious shortage of animal power. To complete the task, district-level winter production committees of three to five people will be organized to specifically lead winter production, and district and village cooperatives will be solely responsible for import and export.
