    On the Policies of the French Socialist Party
    *Qi Sheng*
    The Ramadier Socialist Party cabinet was finally swept from power by the angry tide of strikes of the French working class after ten months in power. Since May 4th of this year, when Ramadier, at the behest of the American and French reactionaries, squeezed the French Communist Party (FCP) members, the true representatives of the French working class, out of the cabinet, the Ramadier cabinet has been in a precarious state. The French working class launched continuous strike struggles to oppose the Ramadier authorities' reactionary economic and foreign policies, making this anti-people and anti-progressive reactionary cabinet uneasy, and only the combined votes of the reactionary right wing in the French parliament gave it the possibility of surviving for another half year. But in the end, it could not withstand the impact of the French workers' movement and collapsed.
    The fall of the Ramadier cabinet marks the bankruptcy of the French Socialist Party's policies and shows that the French Socialist Party, as a smokescreen for De Gaulle's reactionary forces, has lost its role in deceiving the masses.
    Now we will study the policies of the French Socialist Party and its evil consequences.
    The French Socialist Party's policies after the war were actually De Gaulle's policies: domestically, they divided the democratic forces, opposed the French Communist Party from gaining real power, and obstructed reform and democratization; externally, they were anti-Soviet and anti-New Democratic Eastern Europe, advocated a "Western European Group," and relied on American and British imperialism, attempting to establish France's reactionary leadership position in Western Europe. Due to space limitations, we will only discuss its economic and foreign policies.

    The Promises of the Socialist Party
    The economic policies put forward by the French "National Council of Resistance" on March 15, 1944, declared: "(1) To eliminate the power of the big financial oligarchs from the economic sphere; (2) The means of production, the general labor achievements, raw materials and power resources, insurance companies, and large banks must be transferred to the hands of the people; (3) The property of traitors and speculators will be confiscated." The French Socialist Party was a constituent member of this "Council," and after the liberation of France, the Socialist Party repeatedly declared its loyalty to the program of the "National Council of Resistance."
    A year later, on March 2, 1945, the French Communist Party's *l'Humanité* and the Socialist Party's *Le Populaire* simultaneously published a joint declaration of the French Socialist Party and the FCP, emphasizing the implementation of economic reforms. The declaration pointed out: "The meaning of reform lies in: (1) confiscating the property of private capital stock companies and enterprises; (2) simultaneously depriving them of any participation in management rights; (3) handing over leadership to representatives of workers, staff, technicians, and social organs (the French government, county or city councils) under the supervision of the representatives elected by the people; (4) granting the departments and agencies created in this way broad autonomy in administration, business, and technology in each department."
    The reason why the French Socialist Party was able to obtain about four million votes in the post-war elections was obviously due to this economic program that it had announced.
    However, subsequent historical facts proved that the French Socialist Party, led by Blum, did not have the will and desire to implement this program. Its announcement of this program was merely to paralyze the masses and win votes.

    The French People Demand the Abolition of the Power of Big Capital
    As everyone knows, the direct responsibility for France's suffering from Hitler's invasion and subjugation by the German invaders lies with France's two hundred financial families. During the German occupation, France's monopoly capital colluded with the occupying authorities, implementing the so-called "cooperationism." Under their control, 80 percent of French industry was used to serve Hitler's enslavement of the French people and the war of aggression against the Soviet Union. During the four years of occupation, the total trade volume between French "cooperationists" and the German invaders reached 800 billion francs. The capital of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas in the first quarter of 1941 was only 300 million francs, but in the second quarter of the following year (1942), it increased to 900 million francs. During the same period, the issuance of French private stocks increased sharply from 1.287 billion francs to 6.4 billion francs, but in the first quarter of 1940, on the eve of France's fall, the issuance of such private stocks was only 164 million francs. The source of all this income for French monopoly capital was not paid by Hitler's Germany, but was directly plundered from the French working people by the Vichy puppet government in the form of taxes and national debts. Therefore, when the French working people liberated France from the Hitlerian occupiers and the Vichy puppet regime with bloody battles, the general sentiment of the French people was: in order to safeguard national security and restore the historical glory of France, they demanded the deprivation of the power and property of these treacherous and ugly people. The resolutions of the National Council of Resistance and the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), and the joint declaration of the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party, all reflected this popular sentiment. Even the emerging bourgeois political party—the Popular Republican Movement (MRP)—had to express its agreement with the program of the National Council of Resistance and advocate "nationalization" in order to compete in the elections. But once the French Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement gained real power in the state, they immediately betrayed their promises.

    The French Socialist Party is the Bodyguard of French Big Capital
    First of all, the French Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement united to drag their feet on the issue of confiscating the property of French traitors. When implementing the nationalization policy, the Socialist Party further demonstrated its role as a protector of capital.
    Under the insistence of the FCP and the working class, French traitorous enterprises such as Renault automobile factory, Air France, Gnome aircraft factory, five major banks including Banque de France, dozens of metallurgical factories, and coal mines in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais provinces, were successively nationalized. However, during "nationalization," the original owners of the enterprises not only received compensation, but were also retained in leadership positions. For example, after the coal mines in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais provinces were nationalized, the original owners not only retained 49 percent of the shares, but also received a compensation of 8 francs per ton of coal, and could participate in the council of the "Nord and Pas-de-Calais National Coal Corporation." After the Banque de France was "nationalized," the original shareholders received compensation in the form of 3 percent national securities. After Crédit Lyonnais, Société Générale, Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris, and Crédit National were "nationalized," the original shareholders received compensation equivalent to the dividends they received in 1944. More importantly, the managers of all these "nationalized" banks were still entrusted to former bankers and large entrepreneurs by the Socialist Party or Popular Republican Movement ministers of finance. One of the authors of this "caricature of nationalization," as it was called by French trade union newspapers, was the French Socialist Party.
    Because of the Socialist Party's right-wing policies, the power and property of French monopoly capital were still protected, which gave them convenient conditions to sabotage democratic facilities and hinder reconstruction. They used their old power and new official positions to systematically freeze or evade their funds, refuse to invest in production enterprises, especially obstruct the development of already nationalized enterprises, and speculate on inflation and prices, and artificially create a "food crisis." They attempted to frustrate the democratic sentiments of the French working class with this economic poverty and chaos.

    The Socialist Party's "Price Stabilization" Policy Attacks Workers' Lives
    In the face of these evils caused by the Socialist Party authorities' policies, in order to appease the anger of the working class, they proposed a so-called "price stabilization" plan, attempting to "stabilize" the economy with this. At the beginning of this year, the Blum government announced a 5 percent reduction in prices, and then continued to reduce it by 5 percent in March. But what was the result? The prices of the daily necessities of the working people have been rising more and more fiercely. According to a TASS dispatch on September 5: from November last year to September this year, the price of bread in France rose by 128.5 percent, meat by 60 percent, milk by 26 percent, potatoes by 52 percent, and eggs by 64 percent. According to a statement by Ennaff, general secretary of the Paris General Confederation of Labor on October 18, the cost of living for the French people generally rose by 26 percent in the short three and a half months from July 1 to mid-October.
    Following the rise in prices, there was a sharp increase in capitalists' profits and a low decline in workers' wages. According to Ivanov's article "Economic Problems in France" (see Shanghai "Era" No. 206), from 1945 to 1946, the profits of French capitalists increased by 8 to 12 times compared with before the war, while the increase in wages was less than 4 times. Even the mouthpiece of French big capital, "Le Monde," had to admit: "Before the war, the wages of workers in the economic sector were almost equal to the total income of entrepreneurs, but now they are less than half of the above-mentioned income."
    This situation naturally aroused the righteous indignation of the French working class. Under the leadership and supervision of the French Communist Party, the French working class actively and proactively restored French production to 90 percent of pre-war levels last year and rapidly restored the country's damaged transportation facilities. They certainly cannot tolerate the Socialist Party treating these achievements of blood and sweat as gifts, merely increasing the profits of French capitalists. Therefore, it is not surprising that since the end of April this year, the French working class has launched a relentless strike struggle against Ramadier's Socialist Party government, demanding wage increases and changes in economic policy. However, the Socialist Party authorities' countermeasure was to insist on refusing wage increases, and therefore did not hesitate to break with the Communist Party, forcing the FCP cabinet members to withdraw from the cabinet. After the FCP withdrew, the Ramadier authorities approved Finance Minister Schuman's fiscal plan on June 18, deciding to increase new taxes, reduce expenditures under the social insurance law by 12 percent, and reduce factory owners' expenditures on accident compensation funds by 20 percent. Not only that, when the French General Confederation of Labor forced the Federation of Employers to agree to sign an agreement on August 1, stipulating a general wage increase of 11 percent, the Ramadier authorities did not allow the latter to fulfill this agreement. On the other hand, Ramadier announced on August 27 that he would raise general prices by 10 percent and reduce the French people's food rations from 250 grams to 200 grams from September 1 (70 grams less than during the German occupation, and 300 grams less than the current ration in the French-occupied zone of Germany). This is the actual content of the French Socialist Party's economic policy.

    The Socialist Party Brings the Wolf (America) into the House
    The French Socialist Party is not only unwilling to touch the property and power of French monopoly capital, unwilling to use reforms to enable France to solve post-war problems through self-reliance, not only condoning French traitors to sabotage national rejuvenation and create economic chaos and crisis, but also, in order to strengthen the French two hundred families' front against the working class, colluding with foreign, especially American, forces to enter France.
    Blum inherited De Gaulle's policy of relying on the United States and Britain. After the De Gaulle-Truman Franco-American financial agreement at the end of August 1945, he signed another US-French loan agreement in Washington on May 28, 1946. According to this agreement, France received 720 million US dollars in American loans, and the price Blum paid was to use 300 million of it to purchase American military surplus materials scattered in France and French territories during the war. However, according to French experts, these materials are only worth 50 million yuan, and most of them are useless. That's not all. According to the agreement: (1) France allows American goods and capital to freely enter French territory and dependencies; (2) France restores the free import and export business of French private banks that are connected to American monopoly capital. As a result of this agreement, the consequence for France is that it is becoming an increasingly dependent on the American economy. (US-French trade relations in 1946: French imports from the US were 65.041 billion francs; French exports to the US were 6.269 billion francs; French trade deficit with the US was 58.772 billion francs. -Quoted from Russian "New Era" No. 108.)
    The result of "opening the door" to the UK is the same: According to the statistics of the Paris "Le Monde," in 1938 France ranked fifth among British customers and seventh among British suppliers; while in the first half of 1946, France was the UK's first customer and 17th supplier.
    In April of this year, the Ramadier government borrowed another 250 million US dollars from the US International Bank, and the price was to hand over the right to interfere in internal affairs to the US: Under US orders, the FCP was squeezed out of the cabinet, and US officials have the right to supervise that US loans can only be used for enterprises or undertakings favored by the US.

    A Policy of Relying on the US and UK's "Western European Group" and Selling Out French National Interests and Security Guarantees
    On the German question, especially the Ruhr coal issue, the anti-national interests of the French Socialist Party's policies are even more prominent.
    French industry lacks sufficient coal and coking coal. Before the war, France produced 46.5 million tons of coal annually, only enough for two-thirds of its needs, and the remaining one-third was imported, of which 60 percent depended on the Ruhr. The lack of coal and coking coal is also an important factor in the stagnation of French industry after liberation, in addition to the sabotage activities of the French traitors. Thorez said on September 23 this year: "Without Ruhr coal, without compensation, France cannot produce fully, and there is no independence." Therefore, in order to solve the needs of French industry and guarantee France's security, the French people and the French Communist Party have always insisted on adopting a firm policy towards Germany and demanding that the Ruhr be placed under international co-management. The French democratic forces have put forward the demand to use Ruhr coal as compensation to France. However, on this issue, what the French Socialist Party first pursued was the anti-Soviet and anti-communist "Western European Group," and the policy of unconditionally following the US and Britain in splitting Germany and unilaterally controlling the Ruhr.
    On March 4 of this year, thanks to Blum's activities, the UK and France signed a "Treaty of Alliance" in Dunkirk for a period of fifty years. At that time, Ramadier claimed, in order to deceive public opinion, that this alliance could be expanded into a triangular alliance between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union. This statement made many people who longed for world peace harbor illusions. But in fact, this treaty was a contract for the French Socialist Party to formally sell out France's interests to Churchill and Bevin's anti-Soviet "Western European Group." The treaty did not give any guarantees for French security and its need for coal, and only allowed "military assistance" to France in the event of German military aggression. However, this "assistance" had already existed in 1939, and the situation at that time was that Britain remained inactive and France completely collapsed.
    Less than two weeks after the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference at the beginning of this year, France signed an agreement with the UK and the US on April 21 regarding the distribution of Ruhr coal. This agreement indicated that the French Socialist Party authorities, together with Bidault, finally abandoned France's views on the German and Ruhr issues, and abandoned the principle of four-power cooperation. According to the agreement, France recognized in fact and in law the control of the UK and the US over the Ruhr, while the UK and the US, in addition to agreeing that the Saar could be economically merged with France, only agreed to export 210,000 or 300,000 tons of Ruhr coal to France every month when the Ruhr coal production reached 1.187 million tons or 1.913 million tons (but the amount of Ruhr coal required by French industry every month is 1 million tons), but did not guarantee France's need for coking coal, and French steel industry cannot produce fully without coking coal.
    In addition to Ruhr coal, Eastern Europe has the coal that France needs, but the French Socialist Party authorities fear the New Democracy of Eastern Europe, and they would rather buy from the United States. According to the figures in the American "Life" magazine in July of this year, France imports 750,000 tons of American coal every month, which is more than six and a half times the annual output of American coal to Europe before the war! But the price of American coal is surprisingly expensive: if the coal imported by France from the Saar is worth 890 francs per ton, Ruhr coal is worth 1,236 francs, the price of American coal is 2,418 francs.
    Since June, the Ramadier authorities have been serving the US "Marshall Plan" against the Soviet Union, against the New Democracy in Eastern Europe, against the Western European workers' movement, and against the Communist parties in Western European countries more openly and actively, attempting to strengthen its reactionary position in Western Europe and its front against the Communist Party and the working class at home. But so far, the Ramadier authorities have not only failed to obtain any assistance from the "Marshall Plan," but have also faced a serious threat to French security from the resurgence of Germany and the outbreak of a more serious economic and political crisis in France than in the UK because of its surrender to the US and UK plan to rebuild the Ruhr and West Germany, greatly reducing the international and domestic position of the Ramadier government, and finally pushed off the stage by the French people.

    The French Crisis Caused by the Policies of the French Socialist Party
    What are the results of the French Socialist Party's service to American imperialism and French reactionary forces?
    The French people are currently facing two threats: on the one hand, the economic crisis, and on the other hand, the crisis of the De Gaulle partisans returning to power, which is a crisis of the survival of the French Fourth Republic.
    This year, in order to maintain the meager daily ration of 200 grams (approximately 5 taels in China) of bread, France needs to import 825,000 tons of wheat; in order to prevent freezing to death this winter and factories from closing down, it lacks two-thirds of the coal it needs. But what is the position of French international trade, which is caused by the policies of the French Socialist Party? How much purchasing power does France have now?
    According to TASS report on August 24 and Agence France-Presse report on October 24, France's international trade deficit: 1.283 billion francs in 1946, and 867 million francs in the first nine months of 1947.
    France's gold reserves: A total value of US$2,709 million in 1939, US$1,642 million in 1944 (at the beginning of liberation), and dropped to US$455 million in October 1947 (the figures for 1939 and 1947 are based on Associated Press report on October 22, and the figures at the beginning of liberation are converted based on the gold reserves of 1,777 tons at that time).
    This is the current state of the French economy. The Socialist Party's policy is to introduce the wolf of the United States (and the United Kingdom) into France, weakening the French economy by the import of expensive American goods, causing the country to gasp for breath in a huge trade deficit, and then using this as a reason to borrow from the United States again, making the French economy a vassal of the dollar. As of September this year, the amount of money France has borrowed from the United States has reached more than 2.2 billion US dollars, but it still cannot prevent the flow of French gold reserves into the US treasury. The French national financial strength is close to exhaustion, but the French monopoly magnates still hold as much as 3.4 billion US dollars in gold (according to the estimate of the US International Bank), and the French Socialist Party government has no intention of using these "private" properties (which are all plundered from the blood and sweat of the French working people!) to solve France's economic difficulties. On the contrary, it focuses on depriving the already very poor living conditions of the working class. A political party like this dares to steal the title of "socialism" and call itself "centrist"!

    The Essence of the French Socialist Party
    The French Socialist Party has created favorable conditions for the resurgence of De Gaulle, the representative of the old ruling class of French imperialism, with its anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-working-class domestic and foreign policies. The municipal election law announced by Ramadier in September and the municipal elections on October 19 fully demonstrate that the French Socialist Party is De Gaulle's anti-communist scavenger. In the municipal elections, the French Socialist Party openly participated in the joint front of De Gaulle's fascist "alliance" with an anti-communist and anti-working-class program. When De Gaulle openly demanded the dissolution of the current parliament and the abolition of the constitution of the French Fourth Republic, Ramadier still used his anti-communist agitation to win the cheers and support of De Gaulle's followers.
    Since its formation in 1905, the French Socialist Party has been active as an agent of the French imperialist bourgeoisie in the workers' movement. During the First World War, the French Socialist Party was a fervent advocate of imperialist war. When the majority of representatives at the party's Congress of Tours in 1920 demanded a change in policy and participation in the Communist International, the minority led by Blum sabotaged the resolutions of the congress and split to the cesspool of the Second International. Since then, the French Socialist Party has become a destroyer of the unity of the French workers' movement and a vanguard of anti-communism. In July 1934, under mass pressure, the party's leading organs were forced to sign an agreement with the French Communist Party on joint action to oppose the reactionaries, and in 1935 participated in the Popular Front. But when Blum was embraced by the Popular Front into the cabinet and became the head of the government, he announced the treacherous "non-interventionism" in the Spanish Civil War, and later colluded with the French bourgeoisie to implement the Munich policy, preparing for a war against the Soviet Union. After the outbreak of the Second Imperialist War, the French Socialist Party became a gunner against communism and supporting imperialist war. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the lower-level members of the French Socialist Party voluntarily carried out joint struggles with the French Communist Party, but the fruits of this struggle were stolen by Blum and his ilk. When the people demanded reform, Blum did not oppose reform, and he had to issue many pleasing promises in order to deceive the masses. But the French bourgeoisie and American imperialism saw clearly that Blum was one of their own, so they did not hesitate to provide loans and other assistance to the French Socialist Party. "The American reactionaries want to kill two birds with one stone: to subordinate the French economy to themselves with loans and other methods, to guarantee their investment; to strike at the democratic forces, to subdue the French proletariat, and to guarantee the power of the Socialist Party members who serve them, in order to then establish a dictatorship of the De Gaulle type of people." (Ponomarev: "On the Policies of Right-Wing Social Democrats," *Pravda*, June 9) The French Socialist Party has obviously implemented the American plan with its reactionary domestic and foreign policies, and the current situation in France is very critical. The French Fourth Republic, which has been born for less than a year, is facing a serious test.

    The Fate of France is in the Hands of the Working Class
    Of course, the fate of France is not determined by the French reactionary forces and their scavenger, the French Socialist Party, but by the French working class and its party, the French Communist Party. The French Communist Party is not only the most numerous, most strongly organized, and most influential political party in France today, but also the true leader of the French General Confederation of Labor. Any policy and government that the French General Confederation of Labor does not agree with cannot possibly maintain its power. The Ramadier government was overthrown by the struggle led by the General Confederation of Labor, and the Schuman cabinet, which is more reactionary than it, will not have a better fate, which can be asserted. The struggle of the French working class is currently unfolding victoriously.

    论法国社会党的政策
    ·齐生·
    拉马第社会党内阁在其掌权的十个月之后，终于被法国工人阶级的罢工怒潮冲下台了。自今年五月四日拉马第奉美、法反动派之命，将法国工人阶级的真正代表者法共阁员挤出内阁后，拉马第内阁即处于风雨飘摇之中。法国工人阶级为反对拉马第当局的反动经济政策及外交政策，曾展开了持续不断的罢工斗争，使这一反人民反进步的反动内阁坐不安席，仅仅由于法国议会中反动的右派联合票，才给了他半年苟延残喘的可能。但是他终究经不起法工人运动浪潮的冲击而垮台。
    拉马第内阁的倒台，标志着法国社会党政策的破产，说明了作为戴高乐反动势力之烟幕的法国社会党，已失去其哄骗群众的作用了。
    现在我们来研究一下法国社会党的政策及其恶果。
    战后法国社会党的政策，实际上就是戴高乐的政策：对内分裂民主力量，反对法国共产党掌握实权，阻挠改革及民主化；对外则反苏反新民主主义东欧，主张“西欧集团”，投靠美、英帝国主义，企图建立法国在西欧的反动领导地位。因限于篇幅，我们仅就其经济政策与外交政策加以论述。
    社会党的诺言
    一九四四年三月十五日法国“全国抵抗会议”提出的经济政策，宣布：“（一）从经济领域中排除大财政寡头的权力；（二）独占的大生产手段，一般劳动成果，原料与动力资源，保险公司，大银行等必须转到国民手中；（三）卖国贼及投机分子的财产一律充公。”法国社会党曾是这一“会议”的组成分子，在法国解放之后，社会党不止一次地宣布忠实于“全国抵抗会议”的纲领。
    一年以后，即四五年三月二日，法共人道报与社会党民众报同时发表法国社会党与法共的联合宣言，强调实行经济改革。该宣言指出：“改革的意义在于：（一）没收私人资本的股份公司及企业的财产；（二）同时剥夺其对管理权的任何参与；（三）在国民所选代表之监督下，将领导权交予工人、职员、技术家的代表及社会机关（法国政府、县或市议会）的代表；（四）给予由此方法所生的部门与机关以每一部门在行政、营业与技术上的广泛自治权。”
    法国社会党在战后历届选举中之所以能取得四百万左右的选票，显然就是由于它曾宣布过的这个经济纲领。
    可是以后的史实证明，以勃鲁姆为首的法国社会党，并没有实行此一纲领的意志和愿望，它之宣布这一纲领，不过是为了麻痹群众，骗取选票而已。
    法国人民要求废除大资本的权力
    众所周知，法国之遭受希特勒进攻及沦亡于德寇，其直接负责者乃是法国的两百家财阀。在德寇占领时期，法国的垄断资本又与占领当局勾结，实行所谓“合作主义”，在其控制下，法国工业的百分之八十曾被使用来为希特勒的奴役法国人民及侵苏战争服务，四年占领期间，法国“合作主义者”与德寇的贸易总额，达到八千亿法郎之巨。巴黎尼得兰银行在一九四一年第一季的资本只有三亿法郎，而在一年之后（一九四二年第二季），即增至九亿法郎。同一时期，法国私人股票的发行额，从十二亿八千七百万法郎猛增至六十四亿法郎，但在一九四○年第一季，即法国沦陷前夕，这种私人股票的发行额仅有一亿六千四百万法郎，而法国垄断资本这一切收入的来源，并不是希特勒德国付给的，而是经过维希卖国政府以税收、国债等形式直接自法国劳动人民身上剥夺来的。因此，当法国劳动人民以血的战斗将法国从希特勒占领者及维希卖国政权下解放出来之后，法国人民的普遍情绪是：为了保障国家的安全及恢复法兰西的历史光荣，要求剥夺这些法奸丑类的权力及财产。全国抵抗会议及总工会的决议，法共与社会党的联合宣言，都是这种人民情绪的反映。甚至资产阶级的新起政党——人民共和党，为了竞选亦不能不表示同意全国抵抗会议的纲领，并主张“国有化”。可是一当法国社会党与人民共和党掌握了国家实权之后，他们便立即背叛了自己的诺言。
    法国社会党是法国大资本的保镖人
    首先，法国社会党与人民共和党联合一致，对没收法奸的财产问题怠工，而在实行国有政策时，社会党则更表现了资本保护人的作用。
    在法共及工人阶级坚持下，法奸企业如雷诺汽车工厂、爱尔·佛郎士空运公司、格诺姆飞机工厂、法兰西银行等五大银行，数十个冶金工厂，以及诺尔与加莱两省的煤矿，曾先后实行了国有。可是在“国有”时原来的企业主人不仅得到赔偿，而且被保留了领导权。比如法北两省煤矿收归国营后，原主不仅保有百分之四十九的股票，每吨煤可得八法郎的补偿金，并可以参加“诺尔与加莱国家煤业公司”之评议会。法兰西银行“国有”后，原股东得到百分之三的国家证券的赔偿，里昂信用银行，总会银行，国民汇兑事务所，国民工业信用银行，则在“国有”后，原股东得到相等于一九四四年所得红利的赔偿。而更重要的是，所有这些“国有”银行的管理人，仍被财政部社会党或人民共和党部长委托给了以前的银行家与大企业家。这种被法国工会报纸称之为“国有化的滑稽画”的作者之一，便是法国社会党。
    由于社会党的右派政策，法国垄断资本的权力及其财产既然仍受庇护，这就给了他们以破坏民主设施及阻滞复兴的方便条件。他们利用其旧的权势及新的官位，有计划地冻结或逃避其资金，拒绝投资于生产事业，特别是阻挠已国营的企业之发展，而对通货膨胀及物价则进行投机活动，并人工地制造“粮食危机”。他们企图以这种经济的贫困与混乱来挫折法国工人阶级的民主情绪。
    社会党向工人生活进攻的“物价”政策
    社会党当局在其政策所造成的这些恶果面前，为了平抑工人阶级的激愤，乃提出所谓“平抑物价”计划，企图以此来“稳定”经济。本年初，勃鲁姆政府宣布压低物价百分之五，三月份又续减百分之五，可是其结果如何呢？劳动人民的日常必需品之价格，却是越“平”越猛涨不已。据塔斯社九月五日电讯：法国去年十一月至今年九月，面包涨价百分之一二八．五，肉类涨价百分之六十，牛奶涨价百分之二十六，洋芋涨价百分之五十二，鸡蛋涨价百分之六十四。又据巴黎工联总书记恩那弗十月十八日声明，则今年七月一日到十月中旬短短三个半月的时光，法国人民生活费就一般地上涨了百分之二十六。
    跟着物价上涨，是资本家利润的急遽增加与工人薪资的低降。据伊凡诺夫“法国的经济问题”一文（见上海“时代”二○六期）所引，一九四五年至四六年间，法国资本家的利润比战前增长了八至十二倍，而工资的增长则不及四倍。甚至法国大资本的喉舌“世界日报”亦不能不承认：“战前在经济部门的工人工资，几乎与企业家的收入总额相等，而现在，它还不及上述收入的一半。”
    这种情况当然激起法国工人阶级的义愤。法国工人阶级在法共领导和督促下，曾主动积极地使法国的生产在去年就恢复到战前水平的百分之九十，使国内被破坏的交通设备迅速复原，他们当然不能容忍将这些血汗成就由社会党当作礼物，仅仅增加了法国资本家的利润。因此，毫不奇怪，今年四月下旬起，法国工人阶级即开始对拉马第的社会党政府宣布了无情的罢工斗争，要求增加工资改变经济政策。可是社会党当局的对策则是坚持拒绝增资，并因此不惜与共产党决裂，迫使法共阁员退出内阁。而在法共退出后，拉马第当局于六月十八日即批准人民共和党财长舒曼的财政计划，决定增加新税，减低社会保险法项下的支出百分之十二，并将厂主对生产中不幸事件补助基金的支出，缩减百分之二十。不仅如此，当八月一日法国总工会迫使厂主联合会同意签订协定，规定一般工资增加百分之十一时，拉马第当局则不准后者履行此一协定。另一方面，拉马第却于八月二十七日宣布提高一般物价百分之十，并将法国人民口粮配给于九月一日起自二百五十公分减至二百公分（比德寇占领时还少七十公分，比德境法国占领区目前配给量则少三百公分）。这就是法国社会党经济政策的实际内容。
    社会党引狼（美国）入室
    法国社会党不仅不愿意触动法国垄断资本的财产及权势，不愿用改革的方法使法国自力更生解决战后问题，不仅纵容法奸们破坏国家复兴，制造经济的混乱与危机，并且为了加强法国两百家族反对工人阶级的阵地，勾结外国的，特别是美国的势力进入法国。
    勃鲁姆承继戴高乐投靠美、英的政策，在四五年八月底戴高乐杜鲁门法美财政协定之后，于四六年五月二十八日又在华盛顿签订了美、法贷款协定。根据这一协定，法国得到七亿二千万美元的美国贷款，而勃鲁姆所付的代价是：将其中三亿元用来购买战时散留在法境及法国属地的美国军用剩余物资。可是此项物资，据法国专家估计，仅值五千万元，大部分并且是无用之物。这还不算，根据该协定：（一）法国允许美国货物与资本自由进入法国领土及属地；（二）法国恢复与美国垄断资本有联系的法国私人银行自由进出口业务。于是在这一协定下，法国达到的后果是日益变成美国经济的附庸。（一九四六年美、法贸易关系：法国自美输入者，六五○．四一亿法郎；法国输往美国者，六二．六九亿法郎；法国自美入超五八七．七二亿法郎。——引据俄文“新时代”一○八期。）
    对英国“门户开放”的结果亦如此：据巴黎“世界日报”统计，一九三八年法国在英国顾主中占第五位，在英国供应者中占第七位；而在一九四六年上半年，法国则是英国货的第一位顾主，第十七位英国供应者。
    今年四月，拉马第政府自美国国际银行又借得了二亿五千万美元，而其代价则是将内政干涉权交予美国：在美国命令下，法共被挤出内阁，美国大员并有权监督美国贷款只能用之于为美国所喜欢的企业或事业。
    投靠美英“西欧集团”，出卖法国民族利益及安全保障的政策
    在德国问题特别是鲁尔煤的问题上，法国社会党政策的反民族利益，就表现得更其突出。
    法国工业缺乏足够的煤与焦煤。战前法国年产煤四千六百五十万吨，只够其三分之二的需要，其余三分之一靠输入，而其中百分之六十仰给鲁尔。解放后法国工业之所以停滞不前，除法奸们的破坏活动外，煤与焦煤的缺乏也是重要因素之一。多列士今年九月二十三日曾说：“没有鲁尔煤，没有赔偿，法国就不能充分的生产，就没有独立。”因此，为了解决法国工业的需要及保证法国的安全，法国人民及法共一向坚持要求对德采取坚定的政策，并要求将鲁尔置于国际共管之下。法国民主力量提出了以鲁尔煤作为对法赔偿的要求。但是法国社会党在这个问题上，却首先追求的是反苏反共的“西欧集团”，是无保留地追随美英分裂德国片面控制鲁尔的政策。
    今年三月四日，由于勃鲁姆的活动，英法在敦克尔克签订了为期五十年的“同盟条约”。当时拉马第为了欺骗舆论，声称这一盟约并可扩大成英法苏的三角同盟。这一声明曾使许多渴望世界和平的人士抱着幻想。可是在实际上，这一条约是法国社会党正式将法国的利益出卖于邱吉尔、贝文之反苏的“西欧集团”的契约。该条约对法国安全及其煤的需要，未给予任何保证，而只允许在德国军事侵略时，给法国以“军事援助”，可是这项“援助”在一九三九年就有过的，当时的情况是英国按兵不动及法国的总崩溃。
    今年初，莫斯科外长会议失败后不及两周，法国于四月二十一日与英、美签订了关于鲁尔煤分配的协定。这个协定表示法国社会党当局与比道尔一起，最后地放弃了法国对德及对鲁尔问题的观点，放弃了四强合作原则。根据该协定，法国在事实上和法律上承认了英、美对鲁尔的控制权，而英、美则除同意萨尔在经济上可以合并于法国外，仅同意在鲁尔煤产达到一一八．七万吨或一九一．三万吨时，给法国每月输出二十一万或三十万吨鲁尔煤（可是法国工业每月所需的鲁尔煤量为一百万吨），但对法国焦煤的需要则未给以保证，而法国钢工业没有焦煤就不可能充分生产。
    除了鲁尔煤以外，东欧是有法国所需的煤的，可是法国社会党当局害怕东欧的新民主主义，它宁愿向美国购买。据今年七月美国“生活”杂志的数字，法国每月输入的美国煤数达七十五万吨，即超过战前美国煤对欧一年输出量的六倍半！但是美国煤的价格却是奇昂的：如果法国自萨尔输入的煤每吨值八九○法郎，鲁尔煤值一二三六法郎，美国的煤价却是二四一八法郎。
    六月以来，拉马第当局更公开更积极地为美国反苏、反东欧新民主主义、反西欧工人运动、反西欧各国共产党的“马歇尔计划”服务，企图加强它在西欧的反动地位，及国内反共反工人阶级的阵地。但是迄今为止，拉马第当局不仅没有达到“马歇尔计划”的任何援助，反因其屈服于美、英重建鲁尔及西德计划，使法国安全面临德国东山再起的严重威胁，及法国比英国更沉重的经济政治危机的爆发，而使拉马第政府在国际及国内的地位大大地降落，并最后被法国人民推下了台。
    法国社会党政策所引起的法国危机
    法国社会党为美帝国主义及法国反动势力效劳的结果怎样呢？
    法国人民目前面临着两种威胁：一方面是经济的危机，一方面是戴高乐党徒重行上台的危机，这是法兰西第四共和国生死存亡的危机。
    今年年内，为维持不饱的每天两百公分（约合中国五两多）面包的配给，法国需要输入八十二万五千吨小麦；为使今冬不至冻毙及工厂不致关门，它缺乏所需三分之二的煤炭。但是法国社会党的政策所招致的法国国际贸易的地位如何呢？现在法国有多少购买力呢？
    据塔斯社八月二十四日电及法新社十月二十四日电，法国的国际贸易赤字：一九四六年为十二．八三亿法郎，一九四七年前九个月亦达八．六七亿法郎。
    法国的黄金储存量：一九三九年共值二七○九○○万美元，一九四四年（解放之初）为一六四二○○万美元，一九四七年十月份则降至四五五○○万美元（三九与四七年数字据美联社十月二十二日电，解放初数字据当时存金一、七七七吨折算。）
    这就是目前法国经济的面貌。社会党的政策是把美国（还有英国）狼引进法国，使法国经济日益被高价的美货输入品削弱，使国家在庞大的贸易入超中喘息，然后又以此为理由，再向美国告借，使法国经济走向美元附庸的地步。迄今年九月，法国自美借得的款项数达二十二亿美元以上，而仍不能阻止法国黄金储备的流入美国金库。法国国家的财政力量是近于枯竭了，可是法国的垄断大王手中却仍保有数达三十四亿美元的黄金（据美国国际银行的估计），法国社会党政府对于这些“民间”财产（它们全是掠夺自法国劳动人民的血汗呀！）却毫无动用以解法国经济困境之意，相反，它却集中注意于剥夺工人阶级已经十分贫困的生活条件。这样的政党，竟敢窃取“社会主义”的称号，以“中间主义”自居！
    法国社会党的本质
    法国社会党已以其反苏反共反工人阶级的内外政策，为法国帝国主义旧统治阶级的代表戴高乐的卷土重来，造成了有利的条件。九月间拉马第所宣布的市选举法及十月十九日的市选，充分说明法国社会党是戴高乐的反共清道夫。在市选中，法国社会党公开以反共反工人阶级的纲领参加戴高乐法西斯“联盟”的联合阵线，而当戴高乐公然提出要求解散现议会废弃法兰西第四共和国宪法时，拉马第则仍然以其反共的煽动博取戴高乐分子的欢呼与支持。
    法国社会党自一九○五年形成以来，就作为法国帝国主义资产阶级在工人运动中的代理人而活动。第一次大战时，法国社会党曾是帝国主义战争的狂热鼓吹手。当该党一九二○年土伦大会上多数代表要求改变政策参加共产国际时，以勃鲁姆为首的少数派却破坏大会的决议，分裂到第二国际的污水池去。从此法国社会党就成了法国工人运动统一的破坏者，反共的急先锋，一九三四年七月该党领导机关在群众压力下被迫同法共签订了共同行动以反对反动派的协定，三五年并参加了人民阵线。可是当勃鲁姆被人民阵线拥入内阁担任政府首脑之后，他却宣布对西班牙内战采取叛卖的“不干涉主义”，后来并协同法国资产阶级实行慕尼黑政策，准备反苏的战争。在第二次帝国主义大战爆发之后，法国社会党又成为反共及支持帝国主义战争的炮手。德苏战争爆发后，法国社会党下层党员自动与法共进行了联合的斗争，但是这一斗争的成果却又为勃鲁姆之流所窃取，当人民要求改革的时候，勃鲁姆也不反对改革，他为了哄骗群众，不能不发布许多中听的诺言。但是法国的资产阶级及美国帝国主义看得很明白，勃鲁姆是他们的自己人，因此不惜以贷款及其他援助给予法国社会党。“美国反动派想一箭双雕：用贷款及其他方法使法国经济从属自己，保证自己的投资；同时打击民主力量，压服法国无产阶级，并保证为自己服务的社会党人的政权，以便接着建立戴高乐型人们的独裁。”（波诺马列夫：“论右派社会民主党的政策”，真理报六月九日）法国社会党显然已以其反动的内外政策执行了美国计划，法国目前的形势正是十分危急。刚诞生不及周岁的法兰西第四共和国，正面临严重的考验。
    法国命运操在工人阶级手中
    当然，决定法国命运的并不是法国反动势力及其清道夫法国社会党，而是法国工人阶级及其政党法国共产党。法国共产党今日不仅是法国人数最多，组织最坚强，影响最大的政党，而且是法国总工会的真正领导者。法国总工会所不同意的任何政策及政府，要想保持其权力是没有可能的。拉马第政府是被总工会所领导的斗争冲垮台了，继它而起的更反动的舒曼内阁，也不会有更好的命运，这是可以断言的。目前法国工人阶级的斗争，正在胜利开展中。
