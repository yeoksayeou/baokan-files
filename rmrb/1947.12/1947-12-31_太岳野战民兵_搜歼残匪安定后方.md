Taiyue Field Army Militia:
　　Searching and Eliminating Remnant Bandits to Stabilize the Rear
[Report from Taiyue on the 29th] The Taiyue Field Army Militia are fiercely attacking bandits and special agents in various places, stabilizing the rear and establishing revolutionary order. On December 4th, the Meng County battalion militia blocked and attacked the invasion of over a thousand bandits led by the traitor Zhang Bohua. After a day and a half of blocking and fighting on all fronts, the enemy was completely defeated. Village militias in various districts then cleared and searched for remnant bandits. Zhang Ziying's squad from the First District militia captured nine people, including the bandit assassination team leader Xu Zhende. The Hushan Village self-defense force captured two bandits. The Shunjian militia eliminated seven bandits in one night. It is estimated that the entire county captured fifty bandits, including the bandit assassination team leader Xu Zhende, and seized thirty-five rifles in this battle. The bandits have now been wiped out. On November 5th, the Yangcheng militia went to Wufujian in Yuanqu County to clear out the old lair of the remnant bandit Liu Hansan. In the battle of Yishan, the militia artillery first displayed its might. Four artillery shells caused the bandits to flee in disarray. On the same day, they also repelled another bandit army at Yangpi Ridge. On the 6th, our militia advanced to Mianshan and again drove the enemy away with three artillery shells. By the afternoon of the 10th, the remaining bandit troops fled to Baoshan in Pinglu County and crossed the Yellow River overnight. On the 12th, our militia again cleared and defeated more than ten bandit squad leaders and others in the Niutoushan and Qianping areas. Since November 1st, the Wenxi militia has been luring and killing the bandit platoon leader Huang Shuijin in the Houjiao Village area. In just over ten days, Houjiao Village alone captured more than ten bandits, including Liang Jinquan and Gao Pangui. After the Yuanqu Shizipu militia captured Liu Hansan's secret intelligence agent, Pei Dewa, the masses felt even more strongly that they could not completely free themselves unless the bandits and special agents were eradicated. Currently, the masses are launching a campaign to eliminate hidden bandits and special agents. The Zhaocheng Expeditionary Battalion actively suppressed local bandits in western Henan for more than a month, protecting the people's struggle for liberation. The Second, Fifth, and Sixth Companies killed, wounded, and captured six enemies. On the morning of November 29th, the Eighth Company of the Qin County Militia Expeditionary Battalion killed five bandits and wounded six, including the bandit leader Lei Tianxiang, in the bandit suppression battle at Sanlong Temple on Lianshan Mountain in Luoning County, forcing the remaining bandits to flee west. The Sixth Company also achieved results in bandit suppression in Yiyang, killing three and wounding eight.
