    The people of Anyang Recognize the Conspiracy of the Chiang Bandits and Firmly Refuse to Participate in the Pseudo-Organizations of Secret Societies
    [News from this newspaper] In order to prolong their dying lives, the enemy diehards in Anyang desperately and frantically seized grain and conscripted soldiers, and deceived and forced the masses to organize secret societies, which aroused resistance and anger from the broad masses. In the first district, on the 21st, more than 200 bandits from the pseudo-bandit Cheng Daosheng's department went to the Locust Temple in Beibaibi to seize grain. At first, they asked the people for 5,000 jin, but the people said they didn't have any. The bandits angrily searched every house, but found not a single grain. The enemy was about to beat and curse He Wangshou at random, and threatened him in every possible way. He Wangshou shouted loudly: "Everyone, come out quickly!" The masses filled the street, making a lot of noise at the enemy. The enemy had no choice but to leave with He Wangshou. The people were furious and gathered more than 200 men, women, old and young, and chased them all the way to Xinghua Village. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy finally released him. On the 23rd, two companies of the stubborn bandit Wang Ziquan's department went to Jia Village to seize grain, gathered more than 200 people together, and forced them to join the secret society. The masses said, "Even if you shoot us to death with machine guns, we will not join." The enemy had no choice. The enemy diehards of Liu Lexian's department in Meiyuan Village conspired to deceive the masses into organizing a secret society, falsely claiming that the "Eighth Route Army" secretly stole the people's donkeys at Lijia Bridge at night. When the masses discovered it, they knew that the Eighth Route Army did not rob people, so they secretly followed them to Meiyuan Village and found out who did it. The next day, they gathered all the people in the village to see the stubborn army captain in Meiyuan Village and asked for their livestock. The captain said, "I told you to organize a secret society, but you didn't. The Eighth Route Army took them away!" The masses looked to the east side of the courtyard and saw their donkeys tied there, so they shouted, "Our donkeys are here. The Eighth Route Army didn't take them away!" They severely exposed the enemy's conspiracy and tricks.

    安阳群众认清蒋匪阴谋
    坚拒参加会门伪组织
    【本报讯】安阳敌顽为了延续其奄奄一息的狗命，曾不顾一切的疯狂的抢粮抓丁，并欺骗与强迫群众组织会门，激起了广大群众的反抗与愤怒。在一区，二十一日伪匪程道生部二百余人，到北白璧蚂蚱庙抢粮，开始给老百姓要五千斤，老百姓说没有，匪徒们就气愤愤的到各家去搜，结果一粒也未搜出，敌人即将该村和有望乱打乱骂，百般威胁，和有望即大喊道：“大家都赶快出来呀！”群众站满了一街，向敌大吵大闹，敌无法，带着和有望就走，老百姓愤怒了，一打锣集合了二百多男女老少，一直追到杏花村，敌见势不佳，终于将人释放了。二十三日，顽匪王自全部两个连，到贾村抢粮，并将二百多个老百姓齐集一处，强要他们参加会门，群众说：“你们就是用机枪打死我们，我们也不在会，”敌人也没有办法。梅园庄敌顽刘乐仙部，阴谋欺骗群众组织会门，伪称“八路军”于夜间到里家桥偷老百姓的驴，为群众发觉，群众知道八路军不抢人的，便暗地跟踪到梅园庄，知道了是那些坏东西干的。第二日，集合全村人到梅园庄见顽军队长，要牲口，那队长说：“叫你们组织会门，你们不组织，八路军牵走了吧！”群众往院内东边一看，见他们的驴在那里拴着，就大声说：“我们的驴在这里，不是八路军牵走了！”严厉揭破了敌人的阴谋鬼计。
