　　Important Correction

　　In the second clause of the article "Border Region Government Fully Accepts the Land Law Outline Decision" on page one of this newspaper on the 28th, the phrase "but shall not violate the principles of the Land Law Outline of China and the supplementary measures of this government, as well as the demands and interests of the peasant masses" should read "but shall not violate the principles of the Land Law Outline of China and the supplementary measures of this government and the demands and interests of the peasant masses." We hereby make this correction.

　　In the article "Analyzing the Military Crisis of the Chiang Bandit Army from Troop Strength and Morale" published in this newspaper on the 26th, in the fifth paragraph, "Last year, 80 percent of eligible young men in Shanghai requested exemption or deferment from military service," "Last year" is a mistake for "This year." Furthermore, in the seventh paragraph, "From July to October last year, the enemy's losses were 2.5 times ours," "2.5 times" is a mistake for "2.45 times."

　　重要更正
    本报二十八日一版“边府全部接受土地法大纲决定”中，第二条“但不得违反中国土地法大纲和本府补充办法的原则以及农民群众的要求和利益”一句，应为“但不得违反中国土地法大纲的原则和本府补充办法以及农民群众的要求和利益”。特此更正。
    二十六日本报载“从兵力士气看蒋匪军事危机”一文，第五段“去年上海百分之八十的适龄壮丁要求免役缓役”，“去年”系“今年”之误。另第七段“去年七月至十月敌军损失为我之二点五倍”，“二点五倍”系“二点四五倍”之误。
