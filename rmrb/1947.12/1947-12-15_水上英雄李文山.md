    Li Wenshan used to be the squad leader of the seventh squad of the second team of ferrymen at the ×× ferry. Because of his consistently active and responsible work, he has now been promoted to deputy of the sixth team and was awarded the title of First-Class Hero at this Heroic Model Conference. He is one of the representatives attending the All-Military Region Anlan Conference. His heroic and exemplary stories are numerous.

    Once, at the × Zhuang ferry, six wounded soldiers had just crossed over from Henan. At this moment, the plane came, and a flare was dropped. The stretcher bearers were so frightened that they only cared about hiding from the plane. Then Li Wenshan personally boarded the boat and carried the six wounded soldiers to the village one by one; he found stretchers to carry them away before returning. The ferrymen praised him, saying:
    "Squad leader is really capable, treating the wounded better than his own father!" He then said to everyone in a very serious manner: "They were wounded for us, we can't just throw them away!"
    In early June, when crossing stretchers to Henan at the ×× ferry, a militiaman accidentally dropped his gun into the river. The militiaman couldn't swim and didn't dare to go down to retrieve it, and was very anxious. Li Wenshan again voluntarily used a punt pole to probe and asked a young boy to retrieve it for him. The militiaman was endlessly grateful and took out a roll of bills from his waist to give to him, but he refused and explained to the militiaman: "This is public property, I also have a responsibility to protect it."
    When the Liu-Deng army crossed south, his boat made twelve trips across the wide, one-mile-wide river in one night, winning first place among the fourteen boats.
    In August, four divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit New Fifth Army, etc., squeezed a unit of our ×× Field Army into the triangular area at the intersection of the Yellow River and the Qing River, attempting to eliminate it in one fell swoop. Our army also decided to quickly cross the river to the north at the ××× ferry in order to shift direction and seize opportunities to actively strike the enemy.
    Li Wenshan led a squad of people on a boat, and like the other boats, they crossed the river all night on the 13th. Everyone didn't eat a single thing or take a nap.
    The sky gradually turned a fish-belly white color, and a few remaining stars were still faintly visible. According to the river defense rules, the time to stop ferrying and hide the boats had long passed, but a small portion of the troops on the other side had not finished crossing, and the enemy was still approaching our army, no more than four miles away. The situation was extremely tense.
    The commanders of the headquarters and ×× unit made a decision to carry out a forced crossing. In an instant, the new task was passed to the twelve boats, and everyone was nervously preparing, because this was the first time ferrying during the day. Li Wenshan received this new task, and he was already planning in his heart: "Rescuing soldiers is like putting out a fire, it has to be quick!" Then he encouraged the dozen or so ferrymen on the boat, saying: "Comrades! Cheer up! Everyone must not be afraid of sacrifice! If we sweat a little more, the troops over there will shed a little less blood. One more trip across is equal to killing a few more bandits!"
    The first boat crossed safely. When crossing the second boat, American-made Chiang planes suddenly appeared in the sky, and increased from two to fifteen, constantly taking turns diving and strafing the boats. Our army's light and heavy weapons on both sides of the river, covering the crossing, also opened fire at the same time, intertwining into a web of fire. The thick smoke and smell of gunpowder filled the river. Some of the ferrymen on Li Wenshan's boat couldn't hold back. Li Wenshan timely suggested: "Keep calm, don't mind him, work hard to cross, use every punt and oar to fight old Chiang's planes!" At this time, Li Wenshan's boat had slowly reached the middle of the river. Two Chiang planes suddenly dove down sharply, aiming at Li Wenshan's boat with a burst of machine-gun fire. Bullets landed, water splashed everywhere, three punt poles on the boat were broken, an oar was damaged, and several large holes were pierced in the hold. The ferrymen were so frightened that they jumped into the water to hide with a "plop! plop!" Only Li Wenshan was left on the boat. He knew his responsibility was great, and he was determined to complete the task even if he was not killed. He remained calm and continued to steer the rudder, calling on the soldiers to help throw the mooring cables, heading towards the other side. He also comforted the soldiers on the boat, saying: "It doesn't matter! There are our machine guns on the embankment above!" Finally, Li Wenshan finally landed safely with a company on board, and he breathed a sigh of relief, celebrating his and his comrades' victory.

    水上英雄李文山
    荣举
    李文山过去是××渡口水手二中队的七班长，由于他的工作一贯积极负责，现被提升为六中队副，并于这次英模大会荣膺一等英雄衔，是出席全军区安澜大会的代表之一，他的英勇模范故事是很多的。
    有一次，在×庄渡口，刚从河南渡过来六个伤员，恰巧在这时候飞机来了，一扔照明弹，担架民夫们都吓得只顾躲飞机去了，这时李文山便亲自上船，把六个伤员一一背到村里；找到担架抬走才回来。水手们见了他都赞扬的说：
    “班长真能行，待伤号比待他父亲还好呢！”他接着态度很严肃的向大家说：“人家可是为了咱挂的花，咱就不能把人家随便扔掉！”
    六月初，在××渡口往河南渡担架时，一个民兵一不小心把枪掉到河里去了，这个民兵不识水性不敢下去捞，心里很急燥，李文山又自动用篙探着叫小丑下去给人家捞上来了，那个民兵千恩万谢的感激不尽，并从腰里掏出一卷票子送给他，但他拒绝了，并给那个民兵解释说：“这是公家的东西，俺也有责任爱护他。”
    刘邓大军南渡时，他的船头一夜就在宽阔一里的河面上摆渡了十二趟，争取了十四只船中的第一名。
    八月间，蒋匪新五军等四个师将我××野战军某部挤于黄河、清河的岔口三角地带，妄图一举消灭，我军亦为了转移方向，争取机会，主动的打击敌人计，就决定在×××渡口迅速渡河北来。
    李文山带领一班人使着的一只船，也和其他船只一样的在十三号夜里渡了一整夜。大家没吃一点东西，也没打一会盹。
    天逐渐露出鱼肚白的颜色来，几颗残星还在微明的时候，如果按河防的规则来讲，停渡藏船的时间是早已超过了，可是对岸的部队还有一小部分没有渡完，而且敌人还正在向我军逼近中，距我不过四里之遥，情况是异常紧张的。
    指挥部及××某部的首长们下了决心，要实行抢渡。一刹那，新的任务传到了十二只船上，大家都在紧张的准备着，因为白天渡船这还是第一次。李文山受领了这个新任务，心眼里早就盘算起来啦：“救兵如救火，要得快点才行！”接着他又鼓动着船上的十几个水手说：“同志们！加油呀！大家要不怕牺牲！咱们多流一点汗，那边的部队少流一点血，多渡一趟，等于多打死几个匪兵！”
    头一船平安无恙的渡过了，当渡第二船时，美制蒋机突然在上空出现了，并由两架增加到十五架，不停的轮番俯冲向船只扫射，我军两岸掩护渡河的轻重火器，也同时开火，交炽成了一片火网，浓烟硝磺气味弥漫着河面，李文山船上的水手有些都沉不住气了，李文山又适时的提出：“沉住气，不要管他，努力渡，一篙一桨的和老蒋的飞机拼命呀！”这时李文山的船已缓缓的走到河当中了，两架蒋机忽然急骤的俯冲下来，对准李文山的船哒……哒……哒就是一阵机枪，子弹落处，水花四溅，船上的篙被打断了三根，桨打坏了一把，船舱也打透了几个大窟窿，水手们吓的都噗通！噗通的跳下水去躲藏起来，船上只剩下了李文山一个人，他知道自己的责任重大，下决心打不死就得完成任务。他仍然不动声色的继续掌着舵，叫战士们帮助抛着梢锚，向对岸驶去，他还安慰着船上的战士们说：“不要紧！上面堤上有咱的机枪打！”最后，李文山终于使载着的一个连安然登陆，他也长吁了一口气，庆祝着自己和同志们的凯旋。
