(This report from our Taihang office on the 5th) All organizations and groups in Huixian County launched a fundraising campaign at the beginning of this month to help the victims of Yangbankuan who were robbed by Jiang's bandits. The campaign has been met with enthusiastic response from the broad masses of the county. It is reported that more than 3,000 Jiang bandit troops, collaborating with local tyrants and landlords from Xinxiang, Huixian, and Ji counties, along with over a hundred cars and carts, penetrated deep into the Yangbankuan area of the 5th district of Huixian on November 2nd. They carried out six consecutive days of devastating grain robbery and looting. Several villages, including Zhangcun, were almost completely reduced to scorched earth, creating an unprecedented disaster. Local people were left homeless and struggling to survive in the bitter cold. After the Jiang bandits retreated, the county party committee and the democratic government, along with various organizations and groups, immediately tightened their belts to provide relief and organized a condolence delegation to visit the disaster area. The broad masses of people in villages that were not affected by the disaster were extremely indignant at the atrocities of Jiang's bandits upon hearing this news. They actively raised donations of clothing, food, and money to provide relief. According to incomplete statistics, relief supplies delivered to the disaster area include more than 1,400 *shi* of grain, 1.86 million Jicha banknotes, 4,000 pieces of clothing, 137 pots, and more than 1,400 *jin* of cotton. The disaster victims were deeply moved after receiving the relief and condolences and are now actively engaged in production to overcome the famine.
