    Seize the Time to Strengthen Leadership
    Since last month, various regions have successively entered winter production. However, according to reports from various sources, this work is still fragmented and scattered, and has not yet been universally launched. In some places, the leadership has not even paid attention to this work, and has not yet determined a direction or made practical arrangements. As a result, the entire winter production shows serious signs of drifting aimlessly. In some places, although the leadership has repeatedly issued instructions and calls for vigorous implementation, the leadership remains insufficiently thorough, and many cadres show a wait-and-see attitude and complacency, failing to seize the initiative to promote specific actions. Therefore, it still appears lax and powerless. It must be pointed out that without overcoming the above shortcomings, winter production cannot become a mass movement. The approach of the Third Administrative Region of Taihang, published today, is worth learning from by other regions. Production is like fighting a war; neglecting this work is incorrect.
    As some places have already made clear, the poverty alleviation line must be implemented in the winter production campaign, and their difficulties must be seriously resolved; otherwise, winter production cannot be carried out well. In fact, it is the newly established families of poor and hired peasants who lack grain or lack it the most. According to a survey by the Second Administrative Region of Taihang: this year's famine mainly affects the poor and hired peasants. The harvest around Zuoquan City was relatively good, but after the autumn harvest, most poor and hired peasants only averaged about one *shi* of coarse grain per person. In counties such as Pingding and Xiyang, some even had only a few *dou*. Such examples can be found everywhere. This proves that winter production is an urgent requirement for the poor and hired peasants. Therefore, in the work, the poor and hired peasants must be the backbone to organize and promote this work.
    Because this year has a leap month, and next year's spring will come early, preparations for spring plowing, such as gathering firewood and accumulating fertilizer, must be carried out early. The time for winter production is shorter than in previous years. We hope that cadres at all levels will seize the time, and vigorously promote this work in an organized, planned, and focused manner.

### 抓紧时间加强领导

    抓紧时间加强领导
    上月以来，各地已先后转入冬季生产，但根据各方报导，这一工作还很零碎散漫，仍未普遍开展。甚至有的地方，领导上根本就没重视这一工作，至今还没有定出方针与切实布置，因之整个冬季生产，呈现了严重的自流；有的地方，领导上虽一再发出指示、号召大力进行，但领导仍不够深入，而不少干部则表现观望等待与麻痹自满，没有抓紧进行具体推动，故仍表现松懈无力。必须指出，不克服上述缺点，冬季生产就不能形成群众性的运动。今天发表的太行三专区的作法，是值得各地学习的。生产跟打仗一样，忽视这一工作是不正确的。
    正如有些地方已经明确的一样，在冬季生产运动中，必须贯彻贫雇路线，认真解决他们的困难，否则，冬季生产也不能很好开展。实际上，缺粮或缺粮最多的，正是新建家务的贫雇农民。据太行二专的调查：今年灾荒，主要落在贫雇身上，左权城周围收成较好，但贫雇收秋后大多每人只平均粗粮一石左右，平定昔阳等县甚至有只合几斗的。这样的例子，各地都会找到的。由此证明，冬季生产是贫雇的迫切要求，因此在工作中，必须以贫雇为骨干，来组织推动这一工作。
    由于今年闰月，来年春浅，春耕的准备工作如打柴、积肥等必须提早进行，冬季生产的时间较往年短促。希望各级干部，抓紧时间，有组织，有计划，有重点的大力推动这一工作。
