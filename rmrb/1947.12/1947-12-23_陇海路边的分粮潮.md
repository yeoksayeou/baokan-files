　　Grain Distribution Tide Along the Longhai Railway
    Jiluyu Branch
    We started from Huangkou Station and advanced along the north side of the Longhai Railway towards the suburbs of Xuzhou. In the seven days from the 11th to the 17th, we passed through the edges of Feng (County), Pei (County), Xiao (County), Tong (Mountain), and Dang (Mountain). Here, millions of farmers are in hunger and dying. The harm of floods, the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the exploitation of landlords have made it impossible for farmers to live, and they have fled one after another. When the troops arrived at Zhongzhuang, a group of refugees pushing carts to escape the famine turned back. Those who were about to escape the famine stopped preparing their carts. They said, "The People's Liberation Army is here, I'm going to wait for the grain distribution." In the cheers of "The People's Liberation Army is distributing grain," groups of farmers who did not want to starve to death took action. Geng Guangrui of Guozhuang was a big tyrant. The masses reported to us that his family had a lot of grain and asked us, "Will you distribute it?" We said, "Distribute it!" Soon, more than a thousand hungry farmers from four villages gathered at Geng Guangrui's house and distributed more than 10,000 catties of grain and clothing. On the 13th, we were in Tangheyan Village near Huangkou. An old lady had long heard that the People's Liberation Army opened warehouses to help the poor. As soon as we entered the door, she pointed to her small pot and said, "If you hadn't come, I would have starved. I haven't had anything to eat this morning! Your arrival has saved my life..." Liu Xinzhuang, 25 miles away from Xuzhou, has a big landlord with more than 30 hectares of land named Zhu Pinhua. His house occupies half of the village, and the remaining hundred or so thatched houses are inhabited by his tenants. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' police branch is his bodyguard's residence. The People's Liberation Army came here, and all the farmers in the village came to demand the distribution of this bloodsucker's property. At this time, our troops were fighting fiercely with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Gucheng. Although it was only two or three miles away, planes strafed and cannons bombarded here, but the farmers of the whole village settled accounts with Zhu Pinhua, and more than 80,000 catties of grain were distributed to 300 households. An old lady said to Director Zhang, "Your team is good, saving the poor." When the masses were distributing grain, a child couldn't squeeze in, and Commander Li of a certain unit personally carried a bag of grain for him. A pregnant woman did not receive any grain, so he asked the communicator to send a large bag to her home. The masses also demanded to distribute the landlord's clothes. The soldiers found silk, fur coats, floral quilts, and many other good things from the caves, and the grain-distributing farmers stared in amazement, thinking that these troops would want them, but the People's Liberation Army did not keep even half of them, and distributed them to them one by one. Everyone discussed, "The People's Liberation Army is really the team of our common people, they don't want anything." An old lady excitedly recalled her good dream and said, "You People's Liberation Army are so good. I heard that you have distributed grain in the north. I miss you so much that I can't sleep. Two days ago, I had a dream that you Eighth Route Army came and distributed grain. You really came in less than three days, and I won't go hungry anymore!" In eight days, 43,000 hungry farmers along the Longhai Railway received more than 1.8 million catties of grain. The hungry farmers were full, and they talked about: "Later, we will distribute the land, and this will become the People's Liberation Army's territory." Their laughter was filled with new prospects.

　　陇海路边的分粮潮
    冀鲁豫分社
    我们从黄口车站出发，沿着陇海北侧向徐州城郊挺进，十一日到十七日七天以来，经过了丰（县）沛（县）萧（县）铜（山）砀（山）的边缘，这里数百万农民处在饥饿和死亡中，水灾的危害、蒋匪的统治、地主的剥削，使农民再无法生活下去，而相率逃亡。部队到了钟庄，一群推着小车逃荒的难民转了回来，正架上小车准备逃荒的不走了，他们说：“解放军来了，我要等着分粮呢。”在“解放军放粮了”的欢呼声中，一群群不愿饿死的农民行动起来。郭庄耿光锐是个大恶霸，群众向我们报告他家有不少粮，并问我们：“分不分？”我们说“分！”不一会，四个村的一千多饥饿农民，齐集耿光锐家，分了一万多斤粮食和衣物。十三日我们在黄口附近的唐河沿村，一个老大娘早就听说过解放军开仓济贫，咱们一进门，她就指着她的小锅说：“你要不来，俺就得挨饿，今天上午还没饭吃呢！你这一来，可救活了俺的命。………”离徐州二十五里地的刘新庄，有个三十多顷地的大地主叫朱品华，他的房屋占了全村的一半，其余的百十家草屋，都住着他的佃户，蒋匪的警察分驻所，就是他的护院。解放军来到了这里，全村农民都来要求分这个吸血鬼的财产，这时我部正与蒋匪在古城激战，虽然相距二、三里路，飞机向这里扫射，大炮向这里轰击，但全村农民清算了朱品华，八万多斤粮食分到三百户农民手中，一个老大娘对张主任说：“你这队伍好，救穷人。”群众分粮时，一个小孩挤不进去，某部李团长亲自给他扛了一布袋。一个怀了孕的女人没分到粮食，他叫通讯员送了一大布袋到她家里。群众还要求分地主的衣物，战士们从地洞里打出来了绸缎、皮袄、花被子等等许多好东西，分粮的农民瞪眼看着，只当这些军队会要，那知解放军半件不留，一一分给他们，大家议论起来：“解放军真是咱老百姓的队伍，啥东西都不要。”一个老大娘兴奋回忆着她的好梦说：“您解放军真好，我听说您北边都分粮食啦，我想您想的睡不着觉，两天前夜里我做了一个梦，您八路军来啦，分了粮食，没出三天您真来了，我以后就饿不着了！”八天里，陇海路边的四万三千饥饿的农民，分得了一百八十余万斤粮食，饥饿的农民吃饱了肚子，他们谈论着：“晚些时还得分地哩，这就换成解放军的地面了。”他们的欢笑里带着新的展望。
