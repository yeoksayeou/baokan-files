Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, December 8th: Farmers in the newly liberated Yu-Wan-Su District are flocking to join the People's Liberation Army, demanding emancipation and revenge. When a certain unit was stationed in Xiaolizhuang, the poor peasant Li Xintian voluntarily sent his eldest son, Li Guorong, to join the army. When the unit moved, he followed them all the way to the encampment. While a certain unit was marching, a young man named Li Hailong grabbed Political Commissar Jiang and demanded to join the People's Liberation Army immediately. In just one unit of the People's Liberation Army, since crossing the Longhai Railway to the south at the end of September, 200 people from the new district have voluntarily come forward to join the army.
    Xinhua News Agency, E-Yu-Wan Front, December 8th: The people's armed forces in Western Anhui are growing stronger day by day. A unit of the Western Anhui Military Region's armed forces, operating in the southeastern area of Huoshan, defeated two bandit gangs of Chiang Kai-shek who were roaming in the Xiaotianzhen and Mozitan areas from the 25th to the 30th of last month. More than 70 people, including the puppet township chiefs Mao Zhuyuan and Zhang Chenqiao, were captured alive, and some grain and cloth were seized. With the active support of our military region's armed forces, the local people's armed forces in the area have greatly developed. In the last ten days of last month, armed forces in several areas such as Xiaotianzhen and Mozitan have been formed.
