Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd. With the harsh winter approaching, democratic governments and liberated peasants in Shandong are practicing austerity to provide relief to compatriots suffering from Jiang's disasters. The Lu Zhong First Administrative Office and the Fifth Sub-bureau of Industry and Commerce, in addition to distributing large quantities of wool to the disaster-stricken people to make clothing, also lent them over 10,000 kilograms of wool to spin thread for production. In Bin Hai Yi (county) Bei, the liberated peasants, with the understanding that "all poor people are one family, their suffering is our suffering," launched a "one gift, one bowl of grain" relief campaign. The Tai Feng district alone donated over 1,000 kilograms of grain, over 3,300 kilograms of cotton, and hundreds of cotton clothes, pots, and bowls. In Lin Yi and Tancheng, over 10,000 disaster-stricken people who had fled from Jiang's bandits and moved to the central area were warmly received by the local masses in every village, who found them warm kang beds to sleep on, greatly moving them. Liberated peasants in Guang Rao, Bo Xing, Hui Min and other counties in the Bohai Sea area have offered cotton to relieve the disaster-stricken people who have fled from the Jiang-occupied areas of the Jiaoji Railway.

　　山东农民节衣缩食
  　救济蒋灾难胞
    【新华社华东三日电】严冬已至，山东各地民主政府与翻身农民正节衣缩食，救济遭受蒋灾后之难胞。鲁中一专署，与工商五分局除将大批羊毛发给难胞做衣料外，另以羊毛万余斤贷给他们纺线生产。滨海邑（县）北翻身农民在“天下穷人是一家，他们的苦就是我们的苦”的认识下，发起“一件礼物一碗粮”的救济运动，仅太丰区即捐出粮食千余斤，棉花三千三百多斤，及棉衣锅碗等数百件，临沂、郯城因逃避蒋匪转移至中心区的万余难胞，每到一村当地群众即热情招待，替他们找热炕睡，使他们大为感动，渤海广饶、博兴、惠民等县翻身农民纷纷献出棉花救济由胶济线蒋占区逃来的难胞。
