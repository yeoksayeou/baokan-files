[This report from our Taiyue correspondent on the 4th] Wangjiayuan in Qinshui County has organized itself, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, achieving a state of abundant food and clothing. The Wangjiayuan Mutual Aid Brigade preliminarily summarized the entire village's production work from the 20th to the 24th of last month. According to precise statistics, the 34 new middle peasant households in the village that rose from poverty have earned 1,502 *shi* of mixed grains this year from agriculture, wage labor, transportation, and other activities. After deducting 114 *shi* and 7.6 *dou* for public grain, public funds, and social burdens, and deducting 659 *shi* and 6.7 *dou* for the entire class's annual food, clothing, and consumption, there remains an actual surplus of 727 *shi* and 6.4 *dou* of grain, exceeding one-half, truly achieving "cultivate one, surplus one." The 22 old middle peasant households in the village had an actual income of 968 *shi* and 6 *dou* of mixed grains for the year. After deducting public grain, public funds, social burdens, and the entire class's living consumption of 639 *shi* and 9.8 *dou*, there remains an actual surplus of 328 *shi* and 6.3 *dou* of grain, exceeding one-third. Before 1945, the peasants in this village lived under the exploitation of landlords. The village consisted of one rich peasant household, 20 middle peasant households, and 34 poor peasant households. Because they were a mountain village five *li* from the city, most of the poor peasants were tenants of landlords in the city. Everyone called Wangjiayuan the "skinny patch" of the city. Except for the middle and rich peasants who lived fairly comfortably, the total income of all the poor peasants was 309 *shi* and 8.2 *dou* of coarse grains, of which 64 *shi* and 8.7 *dou* was paid to the landlords as rent (during the period of rent and interest reduction). The average annual living expenses per person were only 1.56 *dou* of grain. Compared to this year's average agricultural income of more than 7 *shi* per person, the standard of living has increased fivefold. Furthermore, compared to the situation in 1945 after the victory over the Japanese encirclement, when the area was covered in desolate weeds, women had no clothes to wear to the fields in autumn, and every house lacked doors and windows and quilts in winter, the difference from today is like heaven and earth. After the land was returned to the peasants last spring, all the poor peasants had 518.5 *mu* of land, but among their 111 people, there were only 31 men with full labor capacity, averaging 16.5 *mu* of land to cultivate per person; the old middle peasants had 529 *mu* of land, with 17 men with full labor capacity, averaging over 31 *mu* to cultivate per person. On average, each man with full labor capacity had to cultivate about 22 *mu* of land. This could only be done well if the land was good and there was sufficient livestock. However, of the total 1,047.5 *mu* of land in Wangjiayuan, except for 176.2 *mu* of flat land, the remaining 851.5 *mu* were slopes and steep hills, which made cultivation very time-consuming. At the same time, the village had 24.5 head of cattle and mules, averaging 43 *mu* of land to be cultivated per animal. Under the circumstances of frequent participation in the war this year, it would have been difficult to cultivate well without organization. After organizing for intensive cultivation, the agricultural output of the new middle peasants reached 646 *shi* and 5.9 *dou*, exceeding the expected output (474 *shi*) by one-third. The old middle peasants also exceeded the expected output (412 *shi*) by nearly one-third. However, merely organizing intensive cultivation without engaging in sideline production (the new middle peasants earned another 637 *shi* and 5 *dou* from sideline production, and the old middle peasants earned another 344 *shi* and 3 *dou*), the new middle peasants would not be able to further improve their living standards by nearly one-half on the basis of agricultural income, and the old middle peasants would not be able to improve it by one-third. Therefore, the Wangjiayuan Mutual Aid Brigade has deeply experienced the production policy of organizing intensive cultivation combined with agricultural and sideline occupations. Now, in order to vigorously support the war and defeat Chiang Kai-shek, Wangjiayuan is determined to thoroughly implement the past policy, continue to improve mutual assistance, and launch winter production.

　　王家园组织起来农副结合
    翻身贫农耕一余一
    【本报太岳四日电】沁源王家园组织起来，农副业结合，达到丰衣足食。王家园互助大队，于上月二十至二十四日，已将全村生产工作初步总结。根据精确的统计数字，全村从贫农上升的三十四户新中农，今年农业生产、卖工、运输等各项，收入杂粮一千五百零二石，除负担公粮公款及社会负担一百一十四石七斗六升，扣除全阶层全年吃穿消耗六百五十九石六斗七升外，尚实存粮食七百二十七石六斗四升，余下二分之一，实已达到了耕一余一。全村二十二户旧中农，全年的实收杂粮为九百六十八石六升，除公粮公款社会负担及全阶层的生活消耗六百三十九石九斗八升外，也实际存粮食三百二十八石六斗三升，余三分之一。该村在一九四五年前，农民还在地主剥削中过生活，全村除一户富农外，其余即为二十户中农及三十四户贫农，因为他们是离城五里的山庄，大多数贫农皆为城内地主的佃户，人人称王家园为城里的“刀瘠子”，除中富农生活略够吃用外，全部贫农收入粗粮三百零九石八斗二升，给地主出六十四石八斗七升租子（已减租减息时期），每人全年生活费用仅平均一石五斗六升粮食，若以今年农业收入每人平均约七石多相比，今年的生活程度已提高五倍。再以该村在四五年围困日寇胜利后，到处是荒蒿世界，秋天妇女无衣穿不能上地，家家没门窗，冬天没被窝，与今天情况相比，更是天渊之别。当去春土地还家之后，全部贫农虽已有了五百一十八亩五分土地，但他们一百一十一个人中，男全劳力仅有三十一人，每人平均要种十六亩半土地；旧中农五百二十九亩土地，十七个男全劳力，每人平均种到三十一亩多。平均起来，每个男全劳力或种到二十二亩土地。此种情况，也只有土地好、畜力较全才能种好。但王家园全部一千零四十七亩半土地，除一百七十六亩二分平地外，其余八百五十一亩半皆为坡地和陡地，种起来很误工。同时，全村牛骡二十四头半，每个牲口平均种四十三亩土地，在今年参战频繁的情况下，若不是组织起来，就难以种好。在组织起来精耕细作之后，新中农农业产量竟达到六百四十六石五斗九升，超过应产量（四百七十四石）三分之一。旧中农也超过应产量（四百十二石）近三分之一。但只是组织起来精耕细作不进行副业生产（新中农从副业生产中又收入六百三十七石五斗，旧中农又收入三百四十四石三斗），则新中农生活，也无法在农业收入基础上，再提高近二分之一，旧中农也无法提高至三分之一，故组织起来精耕细作与农副业结合的生产方针，已为王家园互助大队所深刻体验。现王家园为了大力支援战争打倒蒋介石，坚决贯彻以往的方针，继续提高互助，展开冬季生产。
