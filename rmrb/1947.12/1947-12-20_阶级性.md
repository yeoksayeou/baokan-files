Class Character
December 7th, Jinchaji Daily Editorial

It is very important to look at everything from a class perspective. Marx and Lenin both talked about this issue. They said that there is nothing above class in the world, and everything has class character. Do not believe those statements that are above class. If you take Marxism-Leninism as your weapon to look at things, to look at people, to look at leadership, and also to look at yourself, to look at every sentence, every report, every article, to see what class you belong to. With this weapon, our eyes will be sharp, our vision keen, and we will clearly see the essence of things. If you see through it, you see through it; otherwise, you always see the form, see the surface, and do not see the essence.

Everything has class character. Public grain, loans, cooperatives, all have class character. Take cooperatives as an example. There are cooperatives that landlords and rich peasants are satisfied with, cooperatives that middle peasants are satisfied with, and cooperatives that poor peasants are satisfied with. Some comrades say that the land reform in the old liberated areas has been resolved "almost," seemingly "almost." We should ask: Where did you get the material? Who told you? Did the landlords and rich peasants tell you? Did the middle peasants tell you? Did the hired and poor peasants tell you? If the hired and poor peasants in the old liberated areas say that our land problem is nothing, then that is quite reliable; if it is not these people who say it, then do not believe it. The land problem in the old liberated areas has indeed been solved to some extent, and that is a fact. Rent reduction and interest reduction, and some land transfer from landlords and rich peasants, that is also a fact. Landlords and rich peasants saying "almost" is completely different from hired and poor peasants saying "almost." There is class character here. "The cadres have merit," does that have class character? Landlords and rich peasants think he has merit, middle peasants and the general public think he has merit, but ask the hired and poor peasants, and see if this cadre has merit? Not only does he not have merit, but he also has many crimes. This is one kind of view, so it has class character. When fighting landlords and moving stones, some people say: It's too much, it's destroying social order, it's destroying production. He can say that, that's what the landlord would say. According to his class, it is indeed destroying his production and destroying his order. Production has class character, and order has class character. There is the order of the landlord class, and there is the order of the poor. Asking someone who colludes with the landlord to lick the landlord's ass, from the landlord's point of view, is a lack of order, but from the poor peasant's point of view, it is order. Since you are licking the landlord's ass, then you will be punished to actually lick it! Do you think there is no order? This is called order, and the revolutionary masses want this. The problem is to have correct leadership; can the leadership think of other better ways to replace things like licking ass? If our leaders are not responsible, and do not give the peasants ideas, only eat the people's millet, what do they do with it? Establishing a people's court has some order, and the people's court has class character.

Reports and communications all have class character, writing reports has class character, and a correspondent writing a communication also has class character. When you look at a report, or look at anything, you must examine it from a class perspective. What does he write in an opinion or an article? From which class does it come? And what is this class like? Who wrote it? How was the material collected? Where was it collected from? Whose material was listened to? Did it come from hired and poor peasants? Or did it come from landlords and rich peasants? It must be made clear, so that you can see what class position it is. With this kind of analysis, you can see through the essence of the problem. Without this kind of class analysis, you cannot but be formalistic. Therefore, formalism, when looking at problems, cannot see the essence of the problem, and can only see the surface of the problem. Chairman Mao often teaches us to analyze problems, and Lenin's analytical method is the soul of Marxism. Analyze, analyze, and analyze again. Dividing the masses into landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, upper-middle peasants, lower-middle peasants, and also hired and poor peasants, and also the destitute, this is analysis. By analyzing people, analyzing classes and strata, and from their views and reflections on things, their propositions and viewpoints, it can be seen that they all have class character.

Why can't bureaucracy see false reports? What is the reason? It is because your eyes are not sharp, you have not looked more deeply, you are oblivious. Chairman Mao said that you look at it every day, but you can't see it every day. False reports are also there every day, and you see them every day, but you can't see them every day, you never see them, you are oblivious. In a sense, you can call them blind, but they are not blind. If you look at problems according to Marx, and look at things with the method of class analysis, you can see through the essence of anything. Some responsible comrades can quickly see the problem when they arrive in a place, because of what? Because they have a method, which is analysis, investigation, and research. They listen to this, and listen to that. Even if the report looks logical, you must also consider: Who are you? What do you do? What do you represent? Where did your material come from? And so on, examine everything. Many people say that village cadres have merit, so we examine whether they have merit? Where is the merit? Why is there merit? According to what? This way of looking at problems is the method of class analysis. Of course, we must also prevent, do not look at class character everywhere, do not make it so that everything has class character, that shitting and pissing have class character! That dressing and eating, as long as you have delicate hands and feet, you have class character, and only those with rough hands and feet are okay, and if you don't have sores on your body, you are not a proletarian! If you talk about class character in this way, it becomes bias, it becomes formalism. But today it must be emphasized that we must have a class viewpoint when looking at problems and analyzing problems, and for a long time, the class viewpoints of many of our comrades have been vague and unclear. There are many abstract and empty principles of above-class viewpoints and petty-bourgeois viewpoints. With these things, we cannot see, or cannot see through, the essence of the problem.

There is no abstract truth in the world. For example, if the leadership's class viewpoint is vague, or even reflects the thoughts of landlords and rich peasants, and surrenders and compromises with landlords and rich peasants, of course, landlords and rich peasants will say you are good, and it is indeed from their hearts. In their view, it is their "truth." If you are bureaucratic and do not go down to investigate, they also think you are really good. This is not without class character, they think that what you do is "truth," is their "truth"; but from the perspective of the broad masses of working people, hired and poor peasants, there is no truth at all, and the truth is completely the opposite. So there are various ways of saying the truth, and there is no abstract truth. Truth is related to class character. What one class sees as truth, another class does not see as truth. What one class sees as good, and good to the extreme, another class sees as terrible. So a word also has class character. Chairman Mao said in the Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan that the peasant movement was "very good," while some said it was "terrible." Is "terrible" the truth? From the landlord class's point of view, it is the "truth," according to their order it is the "truth"; conversely, "terrible," from the perspective of the working people and peasants' order, it is not the truth, but they see "very good," this is their truth. Therefore, looking at the truth is entirely from the standpoint of the class. Of course, only workers and hired and poor peasants, the most advanced class in the world, see the true truth. The truth of landlords and rich peasants is false truth. If we do not stand on the position of workers and hired and poor peasants, we will not see the essence of anything, and we will not see any truth.

    阶级性
    十二月七日晋察冀日报社论
    一切事情都要从阶级性去看，这是非常重要的。马克思、列宁都讲了这个问题。他们说，世界上没有什么超阶级的东西，一切东西都有阶级性，就不要相信那些超阶级的说法。你拿上马列主义这一条作武器，看事、看物、看人、看领导、也看自己，看每句话、每篇报告、每篇文章，看你自己是什么阶级。拿着这条武器，我们的眼睛就尖了，目就锐敏了，就清楚的看到事物的本质，看透了，不然就看不透，总是看到形式，看到表面，看不到本质。
    什么都有阶级性。公粮也好，贷款也好，合作社也好，都有阶级性。拿合作社来说吧，有地主富农满意的合作社，有中农满意的合作社，有雇贫农满意的合作社。有的同志说：老解放区土地改革解决的“差不多”了，似乎是“差不多”了，我们要问：你根据那里的材料？那个人告诉你的？是地主富农告诉你的？是中农告诉你的？是雇贫农告诉你的？如果老解放区的雇贫农说我们的土地问题没有什么了，那相当可靠；不是这些人讲的，那就不要相信这一套。老解放区的土地问题，的确解决了一些，那也是实事。减租减息，地主富农的土地转移了一些，那也是实事。地主富农讲“差不多”，跟雇贫农讲“差不多”完全不同，这里边就有阶级性。“干部有功”，是不是有阶级性？地主富农认为他有功了，中农及一般的人认为他有功了，问一问雇贫农，看看这个干部有没有功？不但没有功，而且有很多罪过，这是一种人的看法，所以这是有阶级性的。斗地主，搬石头，有些人就说：搞的过火了，破坏社会秩序，破坏生产。他可以这样来说，地主就是那样讲的，照他的阶级来讲，的确是破坏他的生产，破坏他的秩序。生产有阶级性，秩序有阶级性。有地主阶级的秩序、有穷人的秩序。叫一个勾结地主的人舔地主的屁股，从地主看是毫无秩序，贫农看就是秩序。你既然给地主舔屁股就罚你真的舔一舔！你以为没有秩序？这就叫秩序，革命的群众要这样。问题是要有正确的领导；领导上是不是可以想出别的比舔屁股之类更好的办法来代替？我们领导如不负责，不给农民打主意，只吃老百姓的小米，吃了干什么？搞个人民法庭就有一点秩序了，人民法庭就有阶级性。
    报告通讯都有阶级性，写报告有阶级性，通讯员写一篇通讯也有阶级性。你看报告时，或者看什么东西也好，都要从阶级性考查考查。一篇议论，一篇文章，他写什么东西？来自那个阶级？这个阶级又怎样？什么人写的？怎样搜集的材料？从那里搜集的？是听的谁的材料？是不是从雇贫农那里来的？还是从地主、富农那里来的？一定要搞的清清楚楚，这样就可看出是什么阶级立场。有了这样的分析，就可以看透问题的本质。没有这种阶级分析，就不能不是形式主义。因此，形式主义在看问题时，就看不到问题的本质，只能看到问题的表面。毛主席常常教我们看问题要分析，列宁分析方法是马克斯主义的灵魂。分析，分析，再分析。把群众分为地主、富农、中农、上中农、下中农，还有雇贫农，还有赤贫，这就是分析了，把人分析了，把阶级、阶层分析了，而从他们对事物的看法与反映，主张与观点，就可看出都是有阶级性的。
    官僚主义为什么看不到假报告，原因在那里？就是你眼光不锐敏，没有更深刻的去看，熟视无睹。毛主席讲，天天看，可是天天看不到；假报告也是天天都有，也天天看，但是天天看不到，始终看不到，熟视无睹。在某种意义上讲，叫瞎子也可以，但并不是瞎子。如果照马克思这一条去看问题，以阶级分析的方法来看事物，就可看透任何事物的本质。有的负责同志，到一个地方没好久，很快就可把问题看出来，因为什么？因为有一点方法，就是分析、调查、研究，这听听，那听听。看了报告虽然头头是道，也要考虑考虑：你是什么人？你干什么？代表什么？你的材料从那里来？等等，都考查一下。许多人讲，村干部有功劳，我们就考查一下，是不是有功劳？功劳在那里？为什么有功劳？根据什么？这样看问题的方法，就是阶级分析的方法。自然也要防止，不要到处什么地方也要看阶级性，不要搞的什么地方也有阶级性，拉屎拉尿都有阶级性！穿衣吃饭凡是细手细脚都有阶级性，要粗手粗脚的才行，身上不生疮就不是无产阶级！如果这样讲阶级性就成了偏向，成了形式主义。但今天必须着重指出来，我们看问题，分析问题要有阶级观点，而许久以来，我们很多同志的阶级观点模糊不明，超阶级的观点，小资产阶级的观点，很多抽象空洞的道理，有了这些东西，因而就看不到，或看不透问题的本质。
    世界上没有抽象的真理。譬如领导上阶级观点模糊，甚至反映地主富农思想，向地主富农投降妥协，地主富农当然说你好，也的确出于他们的本心。在他们看来，就是他们的“真理”。你官僚主义，不下去调查，他也认为你实在好，这并不是没有阶级性，他们认为你这样做，就是“真理”，是他们的“真理”；而从广大劳苦群众、雇贫农看来，完全没有真理，真理完全是相反的。所以真理有种种的说法，没有什么抽象的真理。真理与阶级性是相联系的。这一阶级看是真理，那一阶级看则不是真理。这一阶级看着好，而且好的不得了，而另一阶级则是糟。所以一句话，也有阶级性。毛主席在湖南农民运动考察报告中说，农民运动“好得很”，有的则说“糟得很”。“糟得很”是不是真理？地主阶级看来是“真理”，照他们的秩序来看是“真理”；反之，“糟得很”，以劳苦人民、农民的秩序来看，就不是真理，而他们却看到“好得很”，这才是他们的真理。因此，看真理，是完全站在阶级的立场出发的。当然，只有工人雇贫农，世界上最前进的阶级，他们看到的真理，才是真正的真理，地主富农的真理，是假的真理，不站在工人雇贫农立场上，我们就会看不见任何事物的本质，看不到任何真理。
