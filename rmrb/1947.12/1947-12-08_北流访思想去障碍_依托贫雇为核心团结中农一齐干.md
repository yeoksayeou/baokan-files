　　Beiliu Visits Homes to Remove Ideological Obstacles
　　Rely on Poor and Hired Peasants as the Core to Unite with Middle Peasants to Work Together
[This Newspaper, Licheng News] Beiliu Village conducted specific organization for winter production during the autumn harvest, but the organization of poor and hired peasant groups by class division and squeezing out feudal elements caused ideological confusion among most of the middle peasants, preventing the full-scale development of winter production. In light of the above situation, the leadership first held a meeting of poor and hired peasants convened by the Party branch for ideological discussions, and then, with the poor and hired peasants as the core, convened a meeting to visit homes and discuss ideology to unite the middle peasants. First, Party members who were poor and hired peasants cleared away ideological obstacles to support the middle peasants and encourage them to boldly express their inner thoughts. At the same time, it was explained that the organization of poor and hired peasant groups was because these people suffered the most from the oppression and exploitation of landlords, and now that they have turned over, they must play an exemplary role in various movements. The re-classification of classes was because the households that should have been struggled against last winter were not, and instead received fruits. Some individual cases were wrong, and today it is necessary to clearly distinguish them. After group discussions, the confused thoughts were cleared away, removing the stumbling block to winter production. Then, the calculation of the year's situation and inventory of family property was carried out, and detailed calculations of expenses were made, shocking the peasants who had turned over and making them aware of the financial holes. Liu Yujiang said: "I was just afraid of accounting. Last year, it was said that we achieved a surplus of one after cultivation, which was calculated as the village average. Who knew how much we poor people were short? This year, it's really scary to only calculate the accounts of us poor people. I will always be frugal in the future, and still eat my original coarse rice and light meals, saving grain to support the front." Duan Maoyou said: "It's not that business doesn't make money, but that everyone doesn't do it. My group earned 35,000 yuan in silver dollars by transporting two trips of dates, and there is no problem buying grass for the livestock." Middle peasant Li Xianghu said: "As long as you go out and run around, the livestock and people will always be full. Saving a dou of rice is also 4,000 yuan. I will drive the livestock to transport, and I will also carry a big dou on my back." After the united meeting of the poor and middle peasants, with the poor and hired peasants as the main force, the middle peasants were united, ideological obstacles were removed, and the winter production movement was launched.

　　北流访思想去障碍
    依托贫雇为核心团结中农一齐干
    【本报黎城讯】北流村在收耕中曾进行了冬季生产具体组织，但因划阶级挤封建进行组织贫雇小组，引起了大部中农思想混乱，使冬季生产不能全面开展。领导上根据以上情况，首先以支部召开了贫雇会议，进行思想座谈，接着以贫雇为核心，召开了团结中农访谈思想会议，首由党员贫雇扫清思想障碍，来给中农撑腰，启发大胆说出内心话。同时说明组织贫雇小组是因我们这些人受地主的压迫剥削最厉害，今天翻了身在各个运动中要起模范，从新划阶级是因去冬该斗户没斗，反而分到果实，有个别搞错了，今天是要明确分清。又经过分组讨论，扫清了混乱思想，掀开了冬季生产的绊脚石，接着进行算年景清家当，详细计算了开支，使翻身农民大吃一惊，认识了窟窿。刘玉江说：“就是怕算账，去年说咱达到耕一余一，那是全村平均来算的，谁知道咱穷人差多少？今年光算咱穷人这账可真怕人呀，我今后总要节约，还吃我原来粗米淡饭，省下粮食支援前线。”段毛有说：“不是买卖不赚钱，而是大家不去干，我小组运输两趟枣，赚洋三万五千元，牲口买草不成问题。”中农李向虎说：“只要到外跑一跑，牲口人总要饱一饱，省下一斗米也是四千元，我要赶上牲口去运输，自己还要背上一大斗。”经过中贫农团结会，贫雇为主团结了中农，解除了思想障碍，展开了冬季生产运动。（刘乃旺、王丕义）
