　　After Studying the Editorial on Supporting the Southern Front
  　Taiyue Administrative Office Pays Attention to Thrift
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 28th] After studying the People's Daily editorial "Give All Our Strength to Support the Southern Front Counter-Offensive," all comrades in the Taiyue Administrative Office and the Industrial and Tax District Bureau have more clearly recognized the rapid development of the current situation and are determined to devote all their strength to win the great victory. Wei Deqing of the Industrial and Tax District Bureau proposed: "Complete two hours of work in one hour." The Administrative Office's communications team originally had five people. Now three people have been drawn to the front line to participate in the war. Only two people remain in the team, and they are working very hard. In handing over this year's production tasks, Li Dianyuan and 19 other comrades from the Administrative Office each handed over an extra 1,000 yuan. In order to reduce the burden on the masses and reduce public expenditure, the Administrative Office is implementing self-sufficiency for 14 winter stoves, which can save 159,000 yuan. Everyone has signed up for coal-carrying plans. In one and a half months, 32 people will carry a total of 33,288 jin of coal.
    [Our Dispatch] Under the call to reduce the people's burden and support the front line, the Fengfeng Mining District's Mine Guard Team was completely converted to a supply system in August of this year. In addition to guard duties, they also engage in agricultural and industrial production. A summary of the five-month production achievements shows a harvest of 6,479 jin of millet, corn, mung beans, buckwheat, etc. The number of personnel participating in production accounts for 34% of the entire team. More than 500 workdays were spent going down the mine and working as temporary laborers. The total production value is over 2 million yuan, which solved the team's 59 members' four months of food, winter clothing, and office miscellaneous expenses, reducing the management office's expenses. This winter, another 60 mu of wheat have been planted. (You Wen)
