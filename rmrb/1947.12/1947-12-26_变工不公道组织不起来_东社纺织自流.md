　　Unfair Labor Exchange Hinders Organization
　　Dongshe Textile Drifts
　　[This newspaper, Licheng News] The five villages of the Zhengshe base point, in order to learn from each other and promote the winter production movement, launched a mutual general inspection of all the villages in the base point on the 16th of this month, lasting one day, with experience exchange in the evening. Wang Shurong, manager of the Shangning Cooperative, said: "I went to Zhengshe to inspect today. Their village has good textile technology guidance. Each group has technical instructors, and each group has a technical team leader. The whole village has a technical committee. Each team has a standard line and standard cloth. Every five days, the teams compare lines and cloth. Every ten days, the technical committee studies the technology and brings the experience to each group. I don't see any third-class lines in their village. Especially the cloth woven by the hired poor peasant Yang Yuzhen is wide and flat, and the spun thread is very fine. We should learn their technical guidance methods." After he finished speaking, Jiao Jiezhi, an activist among the hired poor, said: "I went to Dongshen to inspect and saw that their production was somewhat drifting because the middle peasants were losing out in production. I talked to a woman in one household. I asked her: 'Why don't you spin thread?' She hesitated and said, 'There are too many odd jobs, I can't keep up.' Later she said, 'We lose one or two liang in labor exchange with the poor peasants. We spin four liang for them to count as one work unit, and they spin three liang for us to count as one work unit.' Therefore, she is unwilling to work harder on spinning. I also talked to a hired poor peasant, Wang Chunzhe. I asked him why he wasn't working. He said, 'I'll wait until something happens and catch up' (waiting for a struggle). I see that production is not vigorous, mainly because the labor exchange is unfair, damaging the interests of the middle peasants." After the conversation, they unanimously proposed learning Zhengshe's organizational textile guidance technology, correcting the unequal bias similar to Dongshen, and seizing production to welcome the next inspection.

　　变工不公道组织不起来
  　东社纺织自流
    【本报黎城讯】正社基点五个村，为了互相学习，推动冬季生产运动，在本月十六号，全基点村开展互相大检查，时间一天，晚间交流经验。上宁合作社经理王树荣说：“我今天到正社检查，人家村纺织技术指导好，各组都有技术老师，每组选有技术组长，全村组织有技术委员会，各队有标准线、标准布，五天按队比线、比布，十天技委会研究一次技术，把经验带到各组，我看人家村就没有三等线，特别是雇贫杨玉贞的布又宽又平，纺的线都很细，咱应学习人家的技术指导办法。”他说完，雇贫积极分子焦介支说：“我到东社检查，看他生产有些自流，原因是生产上中农吃亏，我和一家妇女谈，我向他问：‘你为什么不纺线？’他支吾的说：‘杂活多、赶不住。’后来又说：‘和贫农变工吃一两亏，咱给人家纺四两顶一工，人家给咱纺三两顶一工。’因此他就不愿加劲纺织。又和一个雇贫王春则谈，我问他怎么没劳动，他说：‘等出个事儿赶补一下吧’（等争斗），我看生产不起劲，主要是变工不公道，损伤了中农利益。”交谈后，一致提出学习正社组织纺织指导技术，纠正类似东社不等价偏向，抓紧生产迎接再次检查。
