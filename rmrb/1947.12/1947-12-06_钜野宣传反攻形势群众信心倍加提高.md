(Jilu Yu Border Region News, 3rd) After the recovery of Juancheng, a joint meeting of organization and propaganda was held to summarize the shortcomings of past propaganda work and determine future work guidelines and methods. From the reports of various districts, it was reviewed that the past understanding of propaganda work was biased, only knowing that winning battles would stabilize people's hearts and improve mass morale, not knowing the importance of launching a fierce psychological offensive against the enemy, and not paying attention to mass ideological mobilization. For example, in several tug-of-wars, the masses' thoughts were confused, thinking that the war had no end, doubting the counter-offensive, so they ate and drank excessively and did not work. The enemy's deceptive propaganda and rumors were not exposed in time, and the masses were unclear about the policies, so when the enemy retreated, landlords and rich peasants followed, and the basic masses were also panicked. In the land reform work, attention was not paid to ideological mobilization, so that some masses distributed things during the day and sent them back to the landlords at night, and there were also phenomena such as hiding things for the landlords. Due to the above shortcomings, it was decided to vigorously carry out propaganda work. After the meeting, various departments immediately organized propaganda teams, and now various districts are also making every effort to carry out propaganda in various ways. For example, in the work of breaking the city walls in Pengze District, repeated propaganda was carried out, seizing every gap to conduct individual talks, so that everyone could understand the bottom line and their morale was very high. The work of more than 300 zhang, which was 1.3 zhang high, 6 chi wide at the top, and 6 zhang wide at the bottom, was completed in four days. Even the North Gate, which had never been completely demolished in the past, was completely demolished this time. In ×× District, twenty villages wrote nearly 2,000 slogans, and the masses' morale has changed from anxiety to stability, firmly believing that Chiang Kai-shek will be defeated, and various tasks are being restored.

　　钜野宣传反攻形势群众信心倍加提高
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】钜野收复后，即召开组宣联席会议，总结过去宣传工作的缺点决定今后工作方针作法。由各区汇报中，检讨出过去对宣传工作的认识有偏向，只知道打胜仗会稳定人心提高群众情绪，不知道对敌展开猛烈攻心战的重要，不注意群众思想发动。如在几次的拉锯当中，群众思想紊乱，认为战争没有头，对反攻怀疑，便大吃二喝，不干活。对敌人的欺骗宣传造谣，未能及时的揭发，在政策上群众摸不着底，因此，敌人撤走时，地主富农跟着跑，基本群众也恐慌。土改工作不注意思想发动，使有的群众白天分了东西，晚上给地主送回去，给地主藏东西等现象也有。由于以上缺点，决定要大力开展宣传工作。会后，各机关部门立即组织了宣传队，现各区也尽力用各种方式进行宣传。如彭泽区在破城墙工作中，进行反复宣传，抓紧每个间隙，进行个别谈话，使大家都摸着底，情绪很高，把高一丈三尺、顶宽六尺、底宽六丈共三百多丈的工，四天就完成了。连历次未能拆毁的北门，也在这次彻底破除。××区有二十个村庄写上了近两千条标语，群众情绪已由不安到稳定，坚信蒋介石必败，各种工作正在恢复中。
