　　"Leave Him to Fight Chiang Kai-shek"
    Zhang Tiefu
    Li Zunfa and Chen Yongjian, soldiers of a reconnaissance company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, were on sentry duty on the mountain above Chen Da Bay Village. Li Zunfa accidentally triggered his rifle, killing a child herding cattle in a rice paddy at the foot of the mountain. After receiving the report, the unit's higher authorities immediately sent people to handle the matter and decided to hold a public trial and execute Li Zunfa by firing squad.
    Li Zunfa was fourteen years old, from Shou Zhang, Shandong. This year in March, during the celebration of the land reform victory in his village, he volunteered to join the army. The government did not approve because of his young age, but he cried and insisted on going. When he arrived at the unit, they also tried to persuade him not to carry a rifle in the company because of his youth, but he would not listen. When the counter-offensive army marched south, the unit leaders wanted to leave him behind, but he said, "Not letting me participate in the great counter-offensive is like not letting me make revolution." Thus, he followed the army, trekking through mountains and rivers to the Dabie Mountains.
    Li Zunfa was locked in a small room. The next morning, the dead child's father, Chen Laohan, came to see him. After Chen Laohan's child was killed, Chen Laohan had angrily gone to the unit to file a complaint. It wasn't until the company commander and political instructor repeatedly apologized and explained that although it was not intentional, they would definitely execute him according to military discipline to pay for the life and compensate for the loss, that Chen Laohan's anger subsided. Chen Laohan returned home, feeling very sad and conflicted, unable to sleep well all night. Finally, he made up his mind to save Li Zunfa's life. It turned out that during the Red Army era, he had been allocated eight mu of paddy fields, which were all seized by the landlord after the Red Army left. For more than ten years, he had lived a life of poverty. His eldest son worked as a laborer for others, his youngest son herded cattle for others, and he himself raised ducks for others. Now, their own troops had returned from thousands of miles away, and the poor had been liberated again. He thought: How could they execute their own people who had unintentionally killed someone? Chen Laohan got up early in the morning and went to the company headquarters to say to the company commander: "My child is dead, consider it my fate to have no son. This young comrade cannot be killed, let him live; isn't that one more person for our troops?" Then, he ran to see Li Zunfa and said to him, "Don't be afraid, I will definitely protect you." The villagers also came one after another to request that Li Zunfa not be executed.
    In the afternoon, a joint military-civilian public trial was held on the rice threshing ground. The people from Chen Da Bay, Chen Lao Bay, and several surrounding villages came to the meeting place, supporting the old and leading the young. The unit leader explained the facts of the case and our army's discipline, and then announced Li Zunfa's death sentence. The rice threshing ground immediately became noisy. The people shouted, "This is one of our own, and it wasn't intentional, he doesn't need to pay with his life." The crowd surged toward Li Zunfa. When two soldiers were pulling Li Zunfa to be executed, Chen Laohan suddenly rushed over and hugged Li Zunfa tightly. Then old men, old women, and children, more than thirty people in total, surrounded them. Chen Laohan stood in the crowd and said loudly, "I want to save a living person, not a dead one. This is our own army, leave him to fight Chiang Kai-shek! He'll be my son, consider it me sending him to join the army!" A woman in her thirties cried and said, "Some time ago, the 'Central Army' passed through here, my husband didn't want to work for them, and was beaten to death for nothing on the mountain. They didn't even fart and just left. This child didn't kill anyone intentionally, don't kill him, let him avenge me!" After consulting with its superiors, the unit respected the opinions of the people and released Li Zunfa. The unit provided Chen Laohan with seventy silver dollars as compensation and bought a coffin. The soldiers carried the child and buried him. The company commander personally led Li Zunfa, carrying pork and rice, to visit Chen Laohan. When the troops left the village, Li Zunfa said to Chen Laohan, "You saved my life, I will work hard to kill the enemy and come to see you again after I have made merit." Chen Laohan held Li Zunfa's hand and saw him off for several miles.

　　“留下他去打老蒋吧”
    张铁夫
    解放军某部特务连战士李樽发和陈永健在陈大湾村的山头上放哨，李樽发误触枪机，把山角下在稻田里放牛的一个小孩子打死了。部队上级机关接到报告，立即派人处理，并决定召开公审大会，枪决李樽发。
    李樽发现年十四岁，山东寿张人，今年三月间在全村庆祝翻身大会上，自动报名参军，政府因他年纪小不批准，他哭着要去，到了部队，亦因他年轻，说服他不要在连队上背枪，他也不听。反攻大军南下时，部队首长要留下他，但他说：“不叫我参加大反攻，就是不叫我革命。”就这样，他随着大军，跋山涉水到达大别山。
    李樽发被关在一间小屋里，第二天上午，死者的父亲陈老汉跑来看他，当陈老汉的孩子被打死后，陈老汉曾气冲冲的跑到部队控告，直至连长指导员再三赔礼，并说明虽然不是故意伤害，但一定也要按军纪枪毙偿命，赔偿损失时；陈老汉满肚子的气才消下来。陈老汉回到家里，心里很难过，矛盾了一夜没有睡好觉，最后想定了主意，要救下李樽发一条命。原来在红军时代，他分过八亩水田，红军走后，全被地主夺去了。十几年来，一直过着贫苦的生活，大儿给人家揽工，他小儿给人家放牛，自己给人家放鸭子；现在，自己的队伍从几千里外回来了，穷人又翻身了，他想：怎能把不是有意打死人的自己人再枪毙呢？陈老汉清晨起来就去到连部对连长说：“我的小孩子死了，算我命里没有儿，这个小同志不能杀，让他活着，咱的队伍不是多一个人吗？”然后，又跑去看李樽发，对他说：“你不要害怕，我一定要保你。”村里的群众也纷纷来要求不要把李樽发枪毙。
    下午，军民公审大会在稻场上举行。陈大湾、陈老湾，周围几个村子里的老百姓，扶老携幼来到会场。部队首长说明事实经过，及我军纪律，然后宣布李樽发死刑，稻场上立即喧嚷起来，老百姓嚷着：“这是自己的人，又不是故意杀人，不用偿命。”人群拥向李樽发。当两个战士拉着李樽发要去执行枪决时，陈老汉猛然扑过去，一把抱住了李樽发，接着老头、老太太和小孩，三十多个人一齐围上来，陈老汉站在众人中高声说：“我要救活的，不救死的，这是我们自己的队伍，留下他去打老蒋吧，他就算我儿，就顶我送他参军吧。”一个三十多岁的妇女哭着说：“前些时‘中央军’从这里过，我的男人不愿给他们支差，在山上白白被打死，连个屁也不放就走了。这个小孩又不是有意杀人，不要杀他，让他去给我报仇吧。”某部请示了上级之后，尊重老百姓意见，释放了李樽发。该部抚恤陈老汉七十块银洋，买了棺材，战士们抬着把那个孩子埋了。连长亲自领着李樽发，拿着猪肉大米去看陈老汉。部队离开该村时，李樽发对陈老汉说：“你老人家救了我的命，我要努力杀敌人，立了功再来看你。”陈老汉拉着李樽发的手，一直送了好几里。
