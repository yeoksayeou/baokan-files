　　Based on this ideological preparation, Comrade Yi Bo focused on conveying the spirit and decisions of the National Land Conference in light of the actual situation in the region. The conference immediately launched a class examination and ideological investigation movement, strictly carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The ideological struggle was very intense. Many people made typical reflections in general and small group meetings. Many comrades couldn't sleep or eat, weeping bitterly, deeply regretting their unstable class stance and many mistakes. They exposed class enemies who had infiltrated the Party, revealed serious landlord and rich peasant ideologies, capitulationism, and Kuomintang work styles, the madness of petty-bourgeois leftism, hooligan sabotage thoughts, and reflected on serious sectarianism, liberalism, and localism. Military representatives reviewed warlordism. Landlord and rich peasant elements infiltrated the Party and the army, spreading rumors, provoking antagonism between the Party and the army and the people, and undermining land reform. Some cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds in the Party and the army echoed them, greatly damaging the unity of the Party and the people. Some individual Party branches had actually become anti-people cliques. In the ideological struggle, everyone concentrated their fire on severely打击(attack and strike) landlord and rich peasant ideologies. The vast majority of comrades卸下包袱(unburdened themselves) and rejoined the ranks, unanimously feeling the serious harm of these erroneous thoughts and behaviors to the Party and the people, and determined to thoroughly correct their mistakes and transform themselves in the struggle. The ideological movement reached its climax, and everyone happily began to consider how to accept new tasks.
　　From then on, the conference entered its second stage, which was to repeatedly study the Outline Land Law of China. It was unanimously agreed that the Outline Land Law of China represented the fundamental demands of the vast number of peasants in China and also in this region. The methods were simple and easy to implement. In order to clarify the basic spirit of the policy ideologically, in addition to half a month of detailed discussion in small groups, hundreds of representatives spoke enthusiastically at the conference, unanimously supporting it and putting forward many opinions in line with the actual situation in the region, formulating supplementary measures for the implementation of the Outline Land Law of China in the region, and suggesting that the Border Government adopt it as a law.
　　Until the 24th of this month, Comrade Yi Bo summarized the content discussed at the conference. He first asked everyone to firmly remember that the general spirit of the Outline Land Law is: to rely on farm laborers, poor peasants, rural workers, and all poor people to overthrow landlords, equally distribute land, fully meet the demands of farm laborers and poor peasants, and fully mobilize farm laborers and poor peasants. He said: Looking back on the land reform movement over the past year and three months, we have correctly implemented the Central Committee's May 4th instructions, and all five regions have achieved results. Among the 30 million people in the entire region, the peasants in the areas with 10 million people have completely翻身(stood up); the peasants in the areas with 10 million people have not completely翻身(stood up) and need to continue to翻身(stand up); and in the areas with another 10 million people, the peasants'翻身(standing up) is very incomplete and needs to be vigorously carried out. Then Comrade Yi Bo pointed out: Only by relying on farm laborers and poor peasants, mobilizing farm laborers and poor peasants, organizing poor peasant associations, and uniting all middle peasants on the basis of poor peasant associations, establishing peasant associations and peasant representative conferences, and vesting all power in the peasant representative conferences can land be equally distributed thoroughly. In order to realize the above tasks, it is necessary to establish a class stance, viewpoint and method of relying on farm laborers and poor peasants, resolutely stand on the side of farm laborers and poor peasants, ask farm laborers and poor peasants about everything, and proceed from the interests of farm laborers and poor peasants; it is necessary to have the highest enthusiasm for farm laborers and poor peasants, and unlimited faith in the greatness and creativity of the masses, oppose coercion and commandism. Coercion and commandism can be said to be bureaucratic. It is necessary to follow the mass line, to know that everything of the Party is for the masses, and that leaving the masses will lead to the danger of national subjugation, Party destruction, and head loss.
　　Comrade Yi Bo called for struggling for the purity of the Party: We must build a mass-based and combat-effective Party based on workers, farm laborers, and poor peasants as the backbone and Mao Zedong Thought as the foundation, resolutely打击(attack and strike) landlord and rich peasant ideologies, and severely打击(attack and strike) anyone who takes advantage of loopholes in the Party, speculates, and wants to take advantage of the people. After the completion of land reform, it is necessary to rely on the vast number of farm laborers and poor peasants to rectify the Party ranks from the bottom up, transform branches, political power, militia, and cultural education, so that the entire Party and the entire social outlook will be renewed.
　　The summary emphasized transforming the work style of the entire Party in land reform, continuing to carry out the class examination and ideological investigation movement, eradicating bureaucracy, sectarianism, localism, liberalism, and warlordism, overcoming blindness, enhancing consciousness, and learning the work style that every Party member and cadre should have as instructed by Chairman Mao at the Seventh National Congress, being cautious, humble, and guarding against arrogance and impetuosity; not stealing, not bragging, not装(pretending); being honest and wholeheartedly serving the people.
　　Comrade Xu Xiangqian delivered a closing speech, saying: This conference has yielded great results and laid a victorious foundation for implementing the Outline Land Law of China, but this is only the first step. He called on everyone to conscientiously and resolutely complete the historical tasks given by the Party. Comrade Teng Daiyuan said: The army must implement the Outline Land Law of China without exception, rectify the ranks, resolutely eliminate warlordism and sectarianism that is independent of the Party and the people, actively participate in land reform, and fight to defend land reform! Comrade Song Renqiong, on behalf of the Central Bureau, announced the list of some comrades among the conference representatives who had been punished for serious mistakes in land reform, including Xin Xihua, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Jinan District Party Committee, and Liu Peng, former Deputy Minister of the General Military Industry Department, and 31 others who were expelled from the Party. Another 142 people were placed on probation within the Party, and other punishments. The leading organs of three municipal party committees were revoked, the leading organs of three county party committees were reprimanded, and one municipal public security bureau was revoked. He hoped that these comrades who had made mistakes would carefully analyze their mistakes, deeply understand their harm to the people, and resolutely correct them. He said: These facts have educated the entire Party that there is no way out for anti-Party and anti-people actions. After Comrades Liao Chengzhi and Yang Xiufeng spoke, the secretaries of the district party committees, including Wang Congwu, Zhang Xi, Lai Ruoyu, and Wang Hefeng, successively stated: "The conference has profoundly educated me. In the future, under the leadership of the Party and the Central Bureau, I will actively work hard and wholeheartedly strive to implement the Outline Land Law of China." Comrades who were punished submitted notes expressing their willingness to correct their mistakes and atone for their sins under the leadership of the Party and thoroughly transform themselves. Finally, Comrade Yi Bo, on behalf of the Central Bureau, announced the closing of the conference and wished all comrades victory in the land reform work!

　　严格进行批评自我批评彻底打击地主富农思想
    在这一思想准备的基础上，一波同志着重联系本区实际情况传达了全国土地会议的精神和决定，大会旋即展开查阶级、查思想运动，严格进行批评和自我批评，思想斗争十分剧烈，好多人在大会、小会上做了典型反省，不少同志睡不着觉，吃不下饭，痛哭流涕，深悔自己阶级立场不稳犯了很多错误，揭发出混进党内的阶级异己分子，暴露了严重的地主富农思想、投降主义和国民党作风，小资产阶级左的疯狂性，流氓破坏思想，反省出严重的宗派主义、自由主义和地方主义，部队代表检讨了军阀主义，地主富农分子钻进党内和军队内散布流言、挑拨党和军队与人民对立、破坏土改，党内和军队内某些地主富农出身干部从而附和之，大大损害了党和人民的团结，某些个别的党部实际已成为反人民的小集团。在思想斗争中，大家集中火力严厉打击了地主富农思想，绝大多数同志卸下包袱重新归队，一致痛感到这些错误思想行为对党对人民的严重危害，下定决心要在斗争中彻底纠正错误，改造自己。思想运动至此达于最高潮，大家愉快的开始考虑如何接受新任务。
    从此大会进入第二步骤，即是反复的研究中国土地法大纲。一致认为中国土地法大纲代表着全中国同样也代表本区广大农民的根本要求，办法简单，易于实行。为了从思想上弄清楚政策的基本精神，除小组会经过半个月详细讨论外，大会上有百十个代表争先发言一致拥护，并提出切合本区实际情况的许多意见，制定了本区施行中国土地法大纲的补充办法，建议边府采纳定为法令。
    直至本月廿四日，一波同志把大会所讨论的内容做了总结，他先让大家牢牢记住土地法大纲总的精神是：依靠雇农贫农乡村工人及一切贫民打倒地主，平分土地，充分满足雇贫农要求，充分发动雇贫农。他说：回顾一年零三个月的土地改革运动，我们是正确的执行了中央五四指示的，五个地区都获有成绩。在全区三千万人口中有一千万人口区域中的农民已彻底翻身，可是仍有毛病；一千万人口区域中的农民翻身不彻底，需继续翻身；另一千万人口区域中，农民翻身很不彻底，尚需大力进行土改。接着一波同志指出：只有依靠雇贫，发动雇贫，组织贫农团，并以贫农团为基础联合全体中农，成立农会、农代会，一切权力归农代会，才能彻底实现平分土地。为了实现上述任务，必须建立依靠雇贫的阶级立场、观点和方法，坚决站到雇贫方面，一切事情都要去问问雇贫，从雇贫利益出发；必须对雇贫有最高热情，无限的相信群众的伟大和创造力，反对强迫命令，强迫命令可以说是雷厉风行的官僚主义。必须走群众路线，要知道党的一切都　是为了群众的，离开群众，就有亡国亡党亡头的危险。
    一波同志号召为党的纯洁性而奋斗：我们要建设一个以工人、雇农、贫农为骨干，以毛泽东思想为基础的群众性的有战斗力的党，坚决打击地主富农思想，凡是在党内钻空子投机、想占老百姓便宜的人，都要让他受到严重打击。土地改革完成后，还要依靠广大雇贫农，自下而上的整顿党的队伍，改造支部、政权、民兵及文化教育，使全党及整个社会面貌为之一新。
    总结强调在土地改革中改造全党作风，继续开展查阶级、查思想运动，肃清官僚主义、宗派主义、地方主义、自由主义、军阀主义，克服盲目性，提高自觉性，学习毛主席在七大所指示的每个党员干部应具备的作风，谨慎谦虚、戒骄戒燥；不偷、不吹、不装；老老实实、全心全意为人民服务。
    徐向前同志致闭幕辞说：这次大会有很大收获，打下了贯彻执行中国土地法大纲的胜利基础，但这还只是第一步，号召大家兢兢业业坚决完成党给予的历史任务。滕代远同志讲话说：军队要毫无例外的执行中国土地法大纲，整顿队伍，坚决肃清军阀主义与对党对人民闹独立性的宗派主义，积极参加土地改革，为保卫土地改革而战！宋任穷同志代表中央局宣布大会代表中一部分同志因在土改中犯了严重错误而受处分的名单，其中冀南区党委组织部副部长信锡华、曾任前总军工部副部长刘鹏等三十一人被开除党籍，另有一百四十二人受到留党察看等处分，有三个市委领导机关被撤销，三个县委领导机关受指责，一个市公安局被撤销。他希望这些犯错误同志好好分析自己的错误，深刻认识它对人民的危害，坚决纠正。他说：这些事实教育了全党，反党反人民是没有出路的。廖承志、杨秀峰同志讲话后，各区党委书记有王从吾、张玺、赖若愚、王鹤峰等同志相继表示：“大会深刻地教育了自己，今后一定在党和中央局领导下，积极努力，全心全意为贯彻执行中国土地法大纲而奋斗。”受到处分的同志纷纷递条表示愿在党的领导下改过赎罪，彻底改造自己。最后，一波同志代表中央局宣布大会闭幕，并预祝全体同志在土地改革工作中胜利！
