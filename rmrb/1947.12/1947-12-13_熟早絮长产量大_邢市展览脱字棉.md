    Early Maturity, Long Fibers, High Yield:
    Xingtai City Exhibits "Tuozimian" Cotton

    [This newspaper reports] "Tuozimian" (Delinted Cotton) is a superior variety, with the advantages of early maturity and high yield. This year, the First Administrative Office's Agriculture and Forestry Bureau conducted an experiment on a plot of alkaline dry land on a farm, harvesting 250 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is 100 jin more per mu than ordinary foreign cotton. According to several years of planting by the masses in Gaoyi County, in good years, it can yield more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. Another advantage is that the bolls are large and numerous, and the fibers are long and white. Each plant can produce thirty to forty mature bolls, and at most, sixty to seventy. In order to promote this superior variety, on the eighteenth day of the tenth lunar month, at the Xingtai City Department Store Congress, the First Administrative Region's Agriculture and Forestry Bureau specifically conducted an exhibition of whole cotton plants. The masses crowded around to watch, praising, "This cotton is growing really well! What kind of cotton is this? I've never seen it before." An old lady from Nanchang Village, First District of Xingtai County, upon entering the gate and seeing the "Tuozimian" cotton, exclaimed, "Oh my! This cotton looks like white steamed buns!" She used her right hand to nudge several young women who came with her to watch, saying, "I'm fifty-nine years old and I've never seen this before, this one plant can yield half a jin of cotton!" Fu Xigong and two other villagers from Fujiagou in western Xingtai, traveled a hundred li to the city for the congress. On the first day, they were only interested in buying things and didn't know about the exhibition. That night, they heard that the American "Tuozimian" cotton exhibited at the Temple of the Fire God was very good, so they stayed an extra day, waiting specifically to see the "Tuozimian" cotton in the afternoon. A total of approximately 15,000 people visited. The masses from Xingtai, Shahe, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Renxian, Nanhe, Julu, and even more distant counties such as Linqing, Yongnian, Wu'an, Licheng, Luan, Zuoquan, and Heshun, unanimously requested to buy seeds. Zhang Quangen, the militia captain of Xihuang Village, Eleventh District of western Xingtai, picked up two cotton bolls that had fallen on the ground, wrapped them up carefully, and put them in his pocket. He said, "I'll take them back to show the masses, and plant them next year to save the seeds." The First Administrative Region's Agriculture and Forestry Bureau is currently planning to register the seed needs of each county, preparing for large-scale promotion. (Zun Jie)

    熟早絮长产量大
    邢市展览脱字棉
    【本报讯】脱字棉是一种优良品种，优点是成熟早、产量大。今年一专署农林局，在农场一块带碱性旱地试验，每亩摘花二百五十斤，比一般洋花每亩多摘一百斤。根据高邑全县群众几年种植，顶好年成，每亩能摘籽花四百余斤。另一优点是：结桃大而多，毛毛长白。每棵能结成熟桃三、四十个，顶多能结六、七十个。为推广这种优良品种，阴历十月十八日邢台市百货大会上，一专区农林局专门进行原棵展览，群众拥护围观，纷纷称赞：“这棉花开的真好！这是啥棉花？没见过。”邢台县一区南场村的一位老太太，一进大门看见脱字棉就说：“唉哟！这棉花开的象白馍馍！”她用右手拨拉着同她来看的几个青年妇女说：“五十九啦没见过，这一根能摘半斤花！”邢西傅家沟，傅喜功等三个老乡，百里来城赶会，头一天只顾买东西，不知道展览会，当天晚上听说火神庙展览的美国脱字棉花可好哩，便多住了一天，专等下午看脱字棉花。总计参观者约一万五千余人。邢台、沙河、内邱、临城、任县、南和、钜鹿，还有较远的临清、永年、武安、黎城、潞安、左权、和顺等十余县的参观群众，一致要求卖给种子。邢西十一区西黄村民兵队长张全根同志，把掉在地下的两个花絮拾起包好，装在腰包里。他说：“拿回去叫群众看看，明年种上留个籽。”现一专区农林局，正计划登记各县需要种子，准备大量推广。 （尊杰）
