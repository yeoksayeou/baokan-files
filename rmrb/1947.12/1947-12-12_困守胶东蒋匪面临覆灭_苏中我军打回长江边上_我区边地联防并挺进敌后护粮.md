Weekly Consolidated Battle Report:

	East China Battlefield: Following the recovery of Jiaoxian, our army in Jiaodong captured Gaomi on November 27th. Thus, more than 200 miles of the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway is completely under our control. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have now been compressed into a narrow coastal strip from Longkou and Yantai to Weihaiwei, and several isolated cities such as Haiyang and Laiyang. Their land retreat routes have been cut off, and they have become turtles in a jar. On the 7th, the Liberation Army recovered Huangxian County seat east of Longkou and Huangshanguan, a coastal town 50 miles southwest of it, in one fell swoop. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's entire 42nd Brigade of the 8th Division, which had invaded and occupied the area, fled to Longkou, isolated at the corner of the sea, and annihilation is imminent. The bandit garrison in Haiyang has been surrounded by our army on three sides since the 8th of last month. The Chiang Kai-shek 54th Division, which invaded and occupied the city, has repeatedly attempted to break through. In the battle to attack Yu Huangding west of the city on the 21st, they even used poison gas, but were severely attacked by us and never crossed Haiyang. In the past month, a total of more than 3,200 Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been annihilated by us. While our army was annihilating the enemy trying to break through the siege outside Haiyang, another unit of the Liberation Army completely defeated the three brigades of the Chiang Kai-shek 54th Division's 198th Brigade, the 9th Division's 76th Brigade, and the New 74th Division's 57th Brigade in Jin Kou, 70 miles northeast of Jimo, and its vicinity, between the 25th of last month and the 2nd of this month, annihilating more than 3,600 bandits, completely shattering the dream of bandit leader Fan Hanjie to relieve Haiyang. According to a United Press report on the 6th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Haiyang, in desperation, have forcibly requisitioned merchant ships to evacuate some of the remaining bandits from the sea in a panic. Guerrilla teams in various places in Jiaodong cooperated with the main force and attacked everywhere. The enemy attempting to invade Weihai City, fearing the power of the guerrillas inside and outside our city, has been hovering in the northern suburbs and dare not invade the city. The guerrillas in the suburbs of Qingdao and east of Ji (mo) are also very active, constantly inflicting casualties on the enemy. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who are trapped in a few isolated cities in Jiaodong, are extremely panicked and face the fate of total annihilation.

	The Central China People's Liberation Army recently launched a strong offensive on the southern front. In the four days of combat from the 30th of last month to the 3rd of this month, it swept away all the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the Hai'an to *Cha line in one fell swoop, and captured the strategically important strongholds of Libao, Jiaoxie, *Cha, and Dingjiashuo on the line, annihilating a total of 3,400 officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek Reorganized 21st Division and the Home-Returning Legions. The local armed forces in central Jiangsu also took the initiative to attack in coordination with the Hai* line offensive, and successively captured the outposts of Matang and Wuzongbu outside Rugao and Nantong on the 6th and 7th, completely annihilating more than 1,000 enemy troops. Another unit swept the enemy garrison on the Jingjiang-Taixing line, captured Kunlushi, and eight strongholds including Xinzhenshi, an important town on the right bank of the Yangtze River, directly approaching the isolated city of Taixing. The enemy garrison at Wuwu Port on the Yangtze River was forced to retreat in panic. 2,400 square miles of land along the Yangtze River that had been lost for six months have been completely recovered by us.

	Hubei-Henan-Anhui Battlefield: On the 27th of last month, the Liberation Army captured Macheng for the third time, and Guangshan again on the 28th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled upon hearing the news. On the 3rd of this month, the Liberation Army attacked Songbu, 50 miles southwest of Macheng, and completely annihilated a total of 2,475 bandit and puppet security teams, capturing Luo Weijian, the magistrate of Macheng County, alive.

	Local armed forces, with the assistance of the Liberation Army, have grown stronger day by day. The emancipated peasants have successively formed armed forces to cooperate with the main force to thoroughly suppress the remaining bandits and local feudal armed forces. Their momentum is huge, making the bandits and puppets terrified. A unit of the Anhui West Military Region armed forces defeated two groups of Chiang Kai-shek bandits wandering in the southeast of Huoshan between the 25th and 30th of last month, capturing more than 70 alive. On the 2nd, another unit of local armed forces annihilated more than 50 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers near Shangcheng.

	Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui Battlefield: On the 28th of last month, Zhaocheng in eastern Henan was captured again, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 80 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The militia district and township armed forces on both sides of the Wo River in northern Anhui, which have persisted in the struggle behind Chiang Kai-shek's lines, have rapidly grown more than three times since the liberation army arrived in Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu. After the struggle to distribute grain and wealth, the peasants in various townships have raised their awareness, seized the guns hidden by landlords, bullies, and "Home-Returning Legions" to arm themselves, and continuously waged heroic armed struggles against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet bandits.

	Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Battlefield: The Front Headquarters announced that in the three months since crossing the river on August 23, a total of 44,291 Chiang Kai-shek bandits had been annihilated. On the 2nd, the Liberation Army captured Baofeng again, and the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division of the defending enemy fled eastward without a fight. On the same day, Shanyang in southern Shaanxi was captured again, and the defending enemy fled upon hearing the news. Guerrilla corps on various lines have continuously attacked Lushan, Yiyang, Shanxian, Nanyang, and Zhenping, achieving considerable gains. On the 2nd of this month, a unit of the guerrilla corps cleared out Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Pingdingshan area, 20 miles southeast of Songxian, capturing 398 enemy troops.

	Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Battlefields: On the morning of the 3rd, the Liberation Army liberated Yuanshi County, 90 miles south of Shijiazhuang, killing 1,554 Chiang Kai-shek puppet bandit regiment leaders Wei Yonghe and Wang Fujiang, and capturing 3,966 enemy puppet police regiment leaders Geng Mengyi and Zhao Guangyu. A total of more than 5,520 Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated. More than 300 enemies who broke through from Yuanshi and fled north have also been completely annihilated. So far, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, from Baoding city in the north to the outskirts of Anyang in the south, has been completely controlled by us. Our local armed forces are extremely active in the Pingjinbao triangle area. After capturing Matou, 80 miles southwest of Beiping, on the 22nd of last month, another unit of local armed forces advanced west of Tianjin on the night of the 29th, capturing Wangjiakou and Wazitou, 30 miles west of Jinghai, in just one quarter of an hour. On the 30th, they continued to capture Anlitun and Santanli and other strongholds more than ten miles southeast of Shengfang, killing and capturing more than 150 enemy police platoon leaders. In the border areas of Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, our local militia and working teams have shifted from dispersed operations to joint defense operations in anti-grain robbery struggles, and from internal operations to advancing behind enemy lines. Using landmines to blow up the enemy has become a widespread mass movement. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan bandit troops who were isolated and guarding Taiyuan, Yuci, Anyang, and Xinxiang were increasingly panicked under the powerful political offensive of our army, and more and more lower-level officers and soldiers surrendered to us.

	Northeast Battlefield: Local armed forces continue to attack, and our Liaoning and Jilin local corps, active on the front lines of the Chang (chun)-Shen (yang) line and the Shen (yang)-Jin (zhou) line, annihilated more than 900 enemies in November, killing one regimental commander and one battalion commander of the New Sixth Army. Local armed forces in various parts of eastern Hebei have also entered and exited both sides of the Beining Railway, also achieving gains. The winter military training of the Democratic Allied Forces is gradually deepening, and a movement to rectify discipline and widespread "evaluation of teaching," "evaluation of learning," "love of soldiers," and "respect for cadres" has been launched.

    困守胶东蒋匪面临覆灭
    苏中我军打回长江边上
    我区边地联防并挺进敌后护粮
    四日至十日一周综合战报：
    华东战场：胶东我军继收复胶县后，又于十一月二十七日攻克高密，至此胶济路东段二百余里已完全为我控制，蒋匪现已被压缩于龙口、烟台至威海卫沿海狭长一线，及海阳、莱阳几座孤城中，其陆上退路均被切断，已成瓮中之鳖。七日解放军一举收复龙口以东之黄县县城及其西南五十里之沿海重镇黄山馆。侵踞该处之蒋匪整八师四十二旅所部逃窜龙口，孤悬海角，覆灭可待。海阳守匪，自上月八日起即被我军三面包围，侵踞该城之蒋匪五十四师曾多次企图突围，廿一日进攻城西玉皇顶之役，甚至施放毒气，但均遭我痛击，始终未能越出海阳一步，一月来先后被我歼灭之蒋匪计三千二百余人。当我军正在海阳外围痛歼企图突围之敌时，解放军另部于上月二十五日至本月二日间复于即墨东北七十里之金口及其附近地区，将蒋匪东援海阳的整五十四师一九八旅、整九师七十六旅及新七十四师五十七旅三个旅先后完全击溃，歼匪三千六百余名，完全粉碎匪首范汉杰企图解围海阳之梦想。据合众社六日电称：海阳蒋匪于绝望之余，业已强征商船，将残匪一部从海上狼狈撤去。胶东境内各地游击队则配合主力，到处出击。企图侵占威市之敌，因慑于我市内外游击队威力，始终徘徊北郊，不敢侵入市内。青岛市郊及即（墨）东游击队亦极活跃，不断与敌以杀伤。刻困守胶东少数孤城之蒋匪，已极度慌乱，面临全部覆没之命运。
    华中人民解放军近又于南线发动强大攻势，自上月三十日至本月三日四天作战中，一举扫清海安至＠茶全线蒋匪，攻克该线强固设防之战略要地李堡、角斜、＠茶、丁家所等据点，歼蒋匪整编二十一师所属官兵及还乡团等共三千四百余人。苏中地武亦配合海＠线攻势主动出击，六、七两日连克如皋、南通外围据点马塘、五总埠，全歼守敌千余人。另部则扫荡靖江、泰兴线之守敌，攻克昆卢市，及长江右岸重镇新镇市等八据点，直迫孤城泰兴，江边五圩港之守敌被迫仓惶撤退。长江边沿沦陷六个月的二千四百平方华里土地，已完全为我收复。
    鄂豫皖战场：上月二十七日解放军三克麻城，二十八日再克光山，蒋匪闻风逃遁。本月三日解放军向麻城西南五十里的宋埠进攻，全歼匪伪保安队共二千四百七十五人，活捉麻城县长罗维健。
    各地方武装在解放军协助下，已日益壮大，翻身农民纷纷成立武装，配合主力痛剿残匪与各地封建武装，声势浩大，使匪伪为之胆寒。皖西军区武装一部，于上月二十五至三十日将流窜于霍山东南地区之蒋匪两股击溃，活捉七十余名。二日另部地武在商城附近歼蒋匪官兵五十余人。
    苏鲁豫皖战场：上月二十八日再克豫东之柘城，毙伤俘蒋匪八十余名。坚持蒋后斗争之皖北涡河两岸民兵区乡武装，自解放大军进抵豫皖苏以来，已急遽壮大三倍以上。各乡农民经过分粮分浮财斗争，觉悟提高，纷纷搜缴地主恶霸及“还乡团”等暗藏之枪支武装自己，不断向蒋伪匪帮进行英勇的武装斗争。
    豫陕鄂战场：前线司令部公布自八月二十三日渡河以来三个月战绩，共歼蒋匪四万四千二百九十一名。二日解放军再克宝丰，守敌四十一师一二四旅未战东窜。同日再克陕南之山阳，守敌闻风逃遁。各线游击兵团不断出击鲁山、宜阳、陕县、南阳、镇平各地，斩获颇众。本月二日游击兵团一部在嵩县东南二十里之平顶山地区，清剿蒋匪，俘敌三百九十八名。
    晋察冀及晋冀鲁豫战场：三日晨解放军解放石家庄南九十里的元氏县城，击毙蒋伪匪团长魏永和、王福江以下一千五百五十四人，俘敌伪保警团团长耿孟义、赵光玉以下三千九百六十六名，总计歼蒋匪五千五百二十余人。其由元氏突围北窜之敌三百余人，亦已全部就歼。至此，平汉北段北自保定城垣，南迄安阳外围八百里铁路线，已全为我控制。平津保三角地带我地方武装极为活跃，上月二十二日攻克北平西南八十里之马头后，另部地武于二十九日夜向天津以西挺进，仅一刻钟即攻克静海以西三十里之王家口、瓦子头，三十日并续克胜芳东南十余里之安里屯、三滩里等据点，毙俘敌保警中队长以下一百五十余。晋冀鲁豫边沿地区我地方民兵、武工队在反抢粮斗争中，目前在战术上已由分散作战走向联防作战，由内线作战转为挺进敌后，地雷炸敌已成为广泛的群众运动。石家庄解放后，孤守太原、榆次、安阳、新乡各地之蒋、阎匪军，在我军强大政治攻势下，益形慌恐，下级官兵向我投诚者日众。
    东北战场：地方武装不断出击，活跃于长（春）沈（阳）线及沈（阳）锦（州）线前沿之我辽、吉地方兵团，十一月份歼敌九百余人，毙敌新六军所属团长、营长各一名。冀东各地地方武装进出北宁路两侧，亦有斩获。现民主联军的冬季大练兵，正逐步深入，已掀起整顿纪律及广泛的“评教”、“评学”、“爱兵”、“尊干”等运动。（新华社）
