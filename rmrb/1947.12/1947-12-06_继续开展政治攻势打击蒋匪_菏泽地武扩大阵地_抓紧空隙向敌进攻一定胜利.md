[Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region on the 4th] Heze continues to vigorously launch a political offensive against the enemy, vigorously publicizing the great counter-offensive, and cooperating with military offensives to carry out activities deep in the enemy-occupied areas to win over Chiang's puppet troops. County and district armed forces go deep into enemy areas to harass the enemy. In the seven days from the 5th to the 12th, the following activities were carried out: 1. First, village cadres' meetings were held, and then mass meetings were held in small areas or villages to talk about the situation, distribute leaflets, and publicize the situation of the great counter-offensive. In the Lingsheng and Shunhe districts alone, 52 village cadres' meetings and 59 mass meetings were held. 2. To celebrate the counter-offensive, Lingsheng District held a "Counter-Offensive Fair" in Liben Village, and the Fourth District held one in Maji Village. People flocked to the fair from all directions, and many people came. The stalls were filled with small flags with slogans written on them, and large cartoons were painted on the walls, explaining that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits would be defeated and our army would win. After everyone attended the "Counter-Offensive Fair", the situation of the great counter-offensive truly became known to every household. 3. Write slogans, post leaflets, and establish mobile blackboards. Comrades from the Heze People's Daily worked for four nights, printing 2,000 propaganda materials, including three types of leaflets, three types of pictorials, and a map of the counter-offensive situation. These leaflets were widely posted on the west side of the Heze-Kao Road and near Heze City. The Yanhuang District hid the propaganda materials in sorghum stalks pulled by large carts and sent the leaflets to the city. Some were posted on telephone poles or sent to the homes of literate people. In addition, slogans were written in every village, with more than 600 written in the Lingsheng and Shunhe districts alone. During this period, mobile blackboards were also established in various agencies, with various pictorials posted on them, and specialists were on hand to explain. 4. Widely convened puppet family meetings and launched the "Call Sons Home Movement." In seven days, a total of 25 puppet soldiers and fugitive landlords were won over to return home. The mother of a puppet soldier in Zhou Lou, Fourth District, immediately called her child back home after the meeting. In the past, puppet soldiers were skeptical of our lenient policy, but now they all know that it is truly lenient. 5. During this period, Lingsheng District also seized the time to carry out the construction of the "Three D's" (地道, 地堡, 地雷 - tunnels, bunkers, landmines), digging more than 2,300 zhang of tunnels and building six bunkers, and actively attacking the enemy militarily. In seven days, the county and district armed forces fought 17 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 23 enemy soldiers, destroying four Bao Gong offices, and seizing 12 rifles and other spoils of war. We suffered no casualties. This political and military offensive has raised the morale of cadres and the masses throughout the county to an unprecedented level. The Yanhuang and Liming districts, in coordination with the Revenge Detachment, went to enemy areas that they had never been to before overnight. Qingqiu District, in coordination with the brigade, crossed the enemy's highway, inserted itself back into its own district, and destroyed the enemy's "Bao Gong Office." Gengsheng District broke through the enemy stronghold in Shuiniu Village and fought eight consecutive battles. The masses generally recognized the situation of the counter-offensive, saying, "Although Heze has not been attacked, the old roots of his (Chiang Kai-shek's army) have been cut off in the south, and he will soon be finished here!" In the past, the enemy in Shunhe District arrested soldiers very severely, and the masses were pessimistic. After our political offensive, they tried to resist Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of soldiers and generally demanded the establishment of joint defense. Recently, a large number of migrant workers returned from the Longhai Railway, recounting the victories of the People's Liberation Army that they had witnessed, and the morale of the masses was even higher. From this political and military offensive, the leadership realized that as long as we seize the enemy's gaps and weaknesses and attack the enemy, we will surely win. Propaganda work must be given constant importance in the future and must be implemented in all work. The methods of propaganda must be mobile and flexible. In the peripheral areas, large meetings cannot be held; propaganda should be carried out for a few people or at night with speeches to the air. Slogans should be posted in temples or at meetings, not on civilian houses. At present, in order to continue to expand and consolidate the results of this political offensive, the leadership has called on cadres in various districts to stand firm on the expanded positions and seize all gaps to attack the enemy.

　　继续开展政治攻势打击蒋匪
    菏泽地武扩大阵地
    抓紧空隙向敌进攻一定胜利
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】菏泽继续大力开展对敌政治攻势，突击宣传大反攻，并配合军事进攻，深入敌占区活动，争取蒋伪军。县区武装深入敌区活动，袭扰敌人。在五日至十二日七天内，进行了下列活动：一、首先召开村干会，然后以小区或村为单位，召开群众大会，讲形势，散传单，宣传大反攻形势。仅灵圣与顺河两个区，即开了五十二次村干会、五十九次群众会。二．为庆贺反攻，灵圣区在力本屯、四区在马集举行“反攻集”，群众从四面八方拥来赶集，到的人很多，货摊上都插着写了标语的小旗，墙壁上画着各种大幅漫画，说明蒋匪必败，我军必胜。大家赶过“反攻集”后，大反攻形势真正达到了家喻户晓。三、写标语贴传单，建立流动壁报。菏泽民报社的同志打了四天的夜工，印了二千份宣传品，有三种传单，有三种画报，一种反攻形势地图，这些传单普遍贴到菏考路西侧及菏泽城附近。炎黄区把宣传品藏在大车拉的高粱秆里，把传单送到城里去。有的则贴到电线杆上，或送到识字人的家里。另外各村普遍写了一次标语，仅灵圣、顺河两区，即写了六百余条。在这期间，各机关流动壁报也建立起来，上面贴上各种画报，专人在旁讲解。四、普遍召开伪属会，开展“叫子还家运动”，七天内共争取了二十五个伪军与逃亡地主回家。四区周楼一个伪军的母亲，会后马上叫回了自己的孩子。过去伪军对我宽大政策多抱怀疑态度，现在都已知道确实宽大。五、在此期间，灵圣区并抓紧时间进行“三地”建设，共挖了二千三百多丈地道，并建设了地堡六个，并在军事上积极向敌人进攻。七天内，县区武装共作战十七次，毙伤俘敌二十三名，摧毁保公所四处，缴获步枪十二枝，其他胜利品一部，我无伤亡。此次政治、军事攻势，全县干部群众情绪空前高涨。炎黄、离明两区配合复仇支队，连夜到从未到过的敌区。青邱区配合大队，越过敌人公路，插回本区，摧毁了敌人的“保公所”。更生区破了水牛村敌据点，连续作战八次，群众普遍认识了反攻形势，都说：“菏泽虽然没有打，在南边把他的（蒋军）老根截断了，这边他也就快完蛋了！”顺河区过去敌人抓丁要兵很厉害，群众悲观。自我政治攻势后，即设法抵抗蒋匪抓丁，普遍要求成立联防。最近大批民工从陇海路回来，叙述他们亲眼看到的解放军的胜利，群众情绪就更高了。从这次政治、军事攻势中，领导上体会到：只要抓住敌人的空隙与弱点，向敌人进攻，便一定得到胜利。宣传工作今后要经常重视，并要贯彻到一切工作中去。在宣传方式上要机动灵活，在边沿区不能召开大的会议，有几个人就宣传几个人，或夜间进行对空讲话。贴标语要贴在庙上或会上，不要贴到民房上。现领导上为继续扩大与巩固此次政治攻势的成果，已号召各区干部站稳已扩大的阵地，抓紧一切空隙向敌人进攻。
