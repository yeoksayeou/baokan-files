	The Emancipation Movement on the Longhai Railway Line
	Lí Guāng
	When the Longhai Railway breaching campaign began, our cadres from the Fifth Military Sub-district followed the army to the areas along the Longhai Railway, extending from Lankao in the west to Shangqiu in the east, encompassing a large new district of over four hundred and fifty villages. Upon arriving, our first task was to carry out propaganda; explaining the counter-offensive situation and our policies. The railway-breaching laborers also hung up mobile wall newspapers on the streets and gathered the masses in groups of twos and threes to talk about their own emancipation experiences, which greatly excited the masses in the new district. Therefore, whenever we arrived, the masses would surround us, asking questions and pouring out their bitter lives. In a village eight li from the Liuhe Railway Station, an old man leaning on a crutch complained to us, "When the traitor troops were here, they demanded grain after the harvest, every day asking for more. Before spring, we had nothing left to eat. I climbed a tree to pick leaves, and I got dizzy and broke my leg. It will never heal in this lifetime." A tenant farmer in a certain village accused his landlord, "He demanded ninety-six catties of rent per mu. In the past two years, he's added twenty catties of firewood, five catties of grass, and we have to do errands for him; there's no end to the errands, and he doesn't even provide meals. The workers discussed moving out (they lived in the landlord's house), and when the landlord heard about it, he flew into a rage and said, 'Whoever moves, I'll scatter their bones first!' (Because the tenant farmers had no land, their ancestors were buried on the landlord's land). Everyone was too scared to even breathe." Many people shed tears as they spoke.
	In the villages of the new district, landlords' fortresses could be seen everywhere, with imposing mansions standing tall. But now their power has fallen. Old farmers, women, and children in tattered clothes, breaking thousands of years of old customs, rushed into the landlord's gates and recovered the grain and movable property that had been taken away in the past. Deputy Commander Zhou and Director Xia personally helped the masses in over a hundred villages to sort out the landlord's movable property while fighting. The soldiers even helped old women and children carry grain until midnight.
	When the Mamuzhen Railway Station was opened, a comrade went to get a haircut, and the barber complained, "My family of five, the Central Government's currency is worthless, and what I earn in a day isn't enough to eat for a day. My whole family really can't survive." Then he said enviously, "When can we be like the northern side? Once we get land, it'll be good! If I get five mu of land, plus my craft, I won't have to worry about food." Finally, he asked, "When will we distribute grain?" The comrade told him, "Soon." He immediately told his child to get a sack. As soon as the word spread, before the haircut was even finished, two or three hundred people had gathered in the street to get grain. Once we arrived at Pan Village in the middle of the night; soon, poor people asked us, "The fleeing landlords have grain, should we distribute it?" We said yes, and they went everywhere to coordinate, and soon three or four hundred people gathered. The poor people from the surrounding villages also came. Before dawn, they had finished distributing the furniture and clothes. A farmer from Shao Xu Village led us at night, wearing only single trousers, with holes in the trousers exposing his flesh. On the way, he told us that his wife didn't have cotton trousers either, and asked him to get her a pair of cotton trousers when they distributed movable property the next day. The next day, when the movable property was distributed, he indeed got a pair of cotton trousers, and also a quilt. He was extremely happy and came to us and said, "You must come and find me in the future! I'm not afraid even if the traitor troops come back. If you come at night, just stomp a few times on the back wall, and I'll come out and greet you right away."
	After the grain distribution, the masses became even closer to us. One night, we walked to a small village near Wang Bridge and asked a farmer for directions. He volunteered to lead the way. In addition, the masses automatically helped the laborers cook food and reported the special agents and landlords' guns. An old lady in a certain village wanted us to set up a stronghold at her place.
	Now, in the more than four hundred and eighty villages along the Longhai Railway, grain and movable property are being distributed in full swing. The masses have established close ties with us and are fighting against the landlords and Chiang bandits.

    陇海线上的翻身运动
    黎光
    陇海路破击战开始，我们五分区干部，随军到了陇海路两旁，西起兰考东至商邱，包括四百五十多个村庄的大块新区。到那里后，首先便进行宣传；讲反攻形势，讲我们的政策。破路民工也把流动壁报挂在街上，并三三两两召集群众开会，讲自己翻身经过，使新区群众兴奋异常。因此，每当我们一到那里，群众就围上来，问长问短，诉说他们的苦难生活。离柳河车站八里路的某村，一个柱着拐杖的老头向我们诉苦说：“汉奸队在这里时，粮食打下来，被他们今天要，明天要，没到春上，就任啥也没吃的了。我上树摘树叶，眼一黑，把脚跌坏了，一辈子也不能好啦。”某村一个佃户控诉他的东家说：“每亩地要缴九十六斤租子。这二年又加了二十斤柴，五斤草，还要替他出差；出差没有个数，连饭也不管。伙计们商量预备搬出去（住的是地主房子），东家听说了，大发脾气说：‘谁搬，先扬了谁家的骨！’（因佃户没地，填都埋在地主地里）。吓的谁也不敢哼气了。”很多人说时都掉下了眼泪。
    新区村子里，到处可以看到地主的砦围，耸立着威风凛凛的高楼大厦。但是现在他的威风倒了。破衣烂褂的老农民、妇女、儿童，打破了几千年的老例，冲进地主的大门，收回了过去被夺去的粮食浮财。周副司令和夏主任，一面作战，一面亲自帮助了一百多村群众清理地主的浮财。战士们更帮助老婆婆、小孩扛粮食，直到半夜。
    打开马牧车站时，一个同志去理发，理发匠诉苦：“俺家五口人，中央票不顶钱，一天赚的不够一天吃，一家老小真没法过。”接着他又羡慕的说：“啥时能象北边那样？分了地就好啦！我分上五亩地，再加上手艺，就不愁吃啦。”最后他问：“什么时候分粮？”那个同志告诉他：“就要分。”他便马上就叫他小孩去拿口袋。这个风声一传出，头还没剃好，街上集合了二三百分粮的群众。有一次我们半夜到潘庄；不久，就有穷人问我们：“逃亡地主有粮食，该不该分？”我们说了声该，他们就到处去串通，一会集合三四百人，四周小村的穷人也都来了，天不明，把家具衣服都分完了。少徐庄一个农民，夜里给我们带路，还穿着单裤，裤子破的露着肉。路上他告诉我们，他老婆也没棉裤，嘱咐他明天再分浮财时，分给她一条棉裤。第二天分浮财，他果然分的棉裤，并且还分了条被子。他喜欢的了不得，找来对我们说：“你们以后可要来找我呀！汉奸队回来，也不怕。你们晚上来，只要在后墙上跺几脚，我马上就出来接你们。”
    分粮后，群众和我们更接近了。一天晚上我们走到王桥附近的小庄，向农民问路，他自报奋勇的带路。此外群众并自动帮助民工作饭，报告特务、地主的枪枝。某庄老太太要我们在她那里按设据点。
    现在陇海路上四百八十多个村庄，都轰轰烈烈的分粮分浮财。群众已和我们建立了密切的关系，向地主蒋匪们进行斗争。
