    Hebei-Shandong-Henan River Regions
    Actively Prepare for Ice Floe Prevention
    [This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 15th dispatch] After the Anlan Conference celebrated its success and commended models, it entered the second stage, discussing the current main tasks: 1. Winter has arrived, and the Yellow River is about to freeze. Once ice floes arrive, the rapid river water carrying ice blocks will be particularly violent, especially in dangerous sections of the river bends. If straw dikes are used, they will be easily destroyed by sharp ice blocks. Therefore, wooden stakes need to be tied into rafts to protect the straw dikes. Thus, each repair office has made plans for building ice rafts, and is on high alert for the arrival of ice floes. 2. Although this year's major flooding has been safely overcome, there are still many dangerous sections that need to be repaired. It has been decided to gather materials and manpower during the winter slack season, transporting one-third of the materials before the solar new year. A temporary plan is to transport 11.9 million catties of straw and 40,000 cubic meters of stone for the entire section. Currently, the administrative office is assigning the task of gathering and transporting materials to the various special counties along the river.
    [This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River dispatch] (Late arrival) On the 29th of last month, my Shounan section engineering team, leading the masses in flood fighting in Wang, was suddenly strafed and bombed for half an hour by two American-Chiang Kai-shek planes, seriously injuring engineering team members Wang Zhenying and Zhang Bugao.

    冀鲁豫沿河各地
    积极筹防凌泛
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】安澜大会庆功表模后，即进入第二阶段，讨论目前主要工作：一、现已进入冬季，黄河将要结冰，一旦凌泛到来，急剧河水挟着冰块冲击将特别凶猛，尤其在河湾的险工处，如是秸料埽更容易被锋利的冰块冲毁，这就需用木桩绑成排，以掩护秸料埽。因此各修防处分别作了扎冰排的计划，严阵以待凌泛的到来。二、今年大泛虽然已安然渡过，但尚有许多险工需要整理，并决定冬季农闲时运集工料，在阳历年前运全工料的三分之一，全段暂先筹运秸料一千一百九十万斤，石料四万方，现行署正分配沿河各专县进行运集。
    【本报冀鲁豫黄河电】（迟到）上月二十九日，我寿南段工程队，带领群众在汪抢险，突然有美蒋机两架，投弹扫射半点钟，工程队员王振英、张步高二人负重伤。
