　　Becoming a Glorious Class Warrior
　　The Military Recruitment Movement in Lin County
　　Eliminating Old Ideologies and Work Styles
　　In Lin County, during this military recruitment movement, 4,833 liberated peasants signed up to join the People's Liberation Army within five days. After strict review by the masses, 3,685 were approved to become class warriors.
　　At the beginning of the military recruitment movement, large-scale current affairs mobilizations were carried out in counties and districts. However, due to the influence of old ideologies and work styles historically, the first obstacle encountered was the ideological resistance of district and village cadres to current affairs issues. They saw current affairs mobilization as a mere tool, demanding the rapid allocation of tasks. For example, cadres in Chengguan District said, "Once current affairs are mobilized, the masses know what's going on. It's the same whether you talk about it or not. Anyway, the task must be completed. No matter how well you explain it, if the masses are not aware, there's nothing you can do." In response to this idea, criticism and self-criticism were launched, and the purpose of current affairs propaganda was further studied. The development of the counter-offensive situation was repeatedly explained. Only then was the old task-oriented view overcome, and the importance of current affairs education was established ideologically. Districts successively convened mobilization meetings of key district and joint defense personnel, various models, family members of martyrs and veterans. In the Fourth District, at an activists meeting of more than 1,000 people, current affairs education was implemented. Many people excitedly criticized the idea of simply receiving tasks when attending the meeting, as well as the old line in past troop expansions.
　　After current affairs education, everyone's enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. After hearing the news of the victory of the counter-offensive by the various armies, the masses in the Eleventh District unanimously proposed crossing the Yellow River, crossing the Yangtze River, and fighting to Nanjing to capture Chiang Kai-shek. Cheng Yuezhang, a youth from Shigang Village, would ask the cadres for news of the victory on the front lines as soon as they returned from the district. After the cadre told him, he said, "The Liu-Deng army has already embraced Chiang Kai-shek's waist, and we just have to kick his leg to make him fall."
　　After conducting current affairs education, further clarifying class divisions in the villages further enlightened the masses' class consciousness. Therefore, this military recruitment was unprecedented in terms of the number of soldiers, their quality, and their enthusiasm.
　　Family Meetings
　　On the basis of current affairs mobilization, family meetings were held in every village. The family meeting itself was built on the class consciousness of all liberated peasants, overcoming the past practice of not relying on the broad masses, searching for a few targets, and secretly mobilizing them. and some places disguised ways of coercing soldiers.
　　The masses in Qiquan said, "To reunite early, send our sons to the front line." After the family meeting, sixteen young people scrambled to sign up. Zhang Fucun from Third Street, Ren Village, said during the family meeting, "Brother, you are young and haven't married yet. I'll go." His brother said, "I'm young, am I not stronger than you?" The father said, "You are all my sons. How can I say who should go and who shouldn't? Why don't we ask the cadres to discuss it?" In the end, the older one went. When Li Suiyu held a family meeting, he argued with his second brother. The older one said, "I am strong, and I have experience in setting off." The second one said, "I am a bugler, what can you do?" In the end, it had to be voted on at the mass meeting.
　　In Xia Zhaiqu, Eighth District, the convening of family meetings transformed backward public opinion, mobilized women and old men who were previously considered stumbling blocks to joining the army, and turned them into active participants in the movement. Yang Hehua, a woman from Yang He Village in the Sixth District, after persuading her husband to join the army at a family meeting, went to her mother's house to mobilize her two younger brothers and her husband to join the army together. After the deputy village chief of Xia Zhaiqu persuaded his younger brother to join the army, his mother mobilized her neighbors to join the army, to expand the soldiers' strength for her children. When bidding farewell to the new soldiers, many old men and women said, "I can rest assured that you group of people are going. Take care of each other when you're out there."
　　The active participation of Party members and cadres in signing up was also an important key to completing the military recruitment task this time. Cheng Niushan and Cheng Yutang, openly known Party members from Ren Village, heard that they were going to fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. They said, "This is our business. If we don't go, who will?" They immediately discussed it at the branch meeting and signed up, influencing twelve Party members to go. Under the influence of Party members and cadres, everyone prepared to sign up. That night, as soon as the radio station broadcast, the whole village started holding family meetings. The next day, when the whole village held a meeting to publicize current affairs, as soon as the chairman said a few words, the people who were preparing to sign up surrounded the table. The chairman couldn't write fast enough and shouted to stop, stop. The more he shouted, the more they rushed to sign up, all saying they couldn't miss the good opportunity. Cheng Jiulu said, "Prepare belts and rice bags for my third child early. We've waited seven or eight times. We can't miss it again." Yue Jianglin and Wang Shigui anxiously shouted loudly, "Political Director, I told you long ago that I wanted to join the army. I missed the last battle. This time, you must put my name on the list." Within an hour, sixty or seventy people from Ren Village signed up.
　　It is Glorious to be a Class Warrior
　　No feudal remnants were allowed to infiltrate the military recruitment movement. This time, many places handed over the new soldiers to the masses for review.
　　In Guojia Kiln, Eighth District, after twenty-five soldiers signed up to join the army, a mass meeting of the entire village was immediately convened to let the masses review them. After class division, five feudal remnants, two sick people, and one person who had worked in the Chiang government were removed. The new soldiers expressed their attitude to the masses, saying, "We are all going voluntarily. We will definitely serve everyone well and never desert. We won't have the face to see you if we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek. If you have any opinions about us, please feel free to raise them." The masses said in unison, "No." Ge Shuang, a feudal remnant, said, "If everyone has any opinions about me, please settle the score with me! I am willing to send my son to join the army." The new soldiers said to the masses, "Don't try to take advantage of the situation. It's not enough for us to defeat Chiang Kai-shek."
　　When Qing Sha recruited thirty young men to join the army, the class division removed the divided nephew of a landlord and traitor. The masses in Luzhai said, "There must be conditions for joining the People's Liberation Army. Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is our own business. We can't let landlords go." During the review, a bankrupt landlord was removed. The director of the Nanmujing Armed Committee was also squeezed out at the class review meeting for new soldiers in the entire district.
　　After the review, it was proposed not to let the new soldiers carry away a single ideological burden. Villages held forums and farewells. Cadres, the masses, and soldiers all made guarantees, and some even signed contracts.
　　At the farewell forum in Sanzhai, the soldiers gave the cadres and the masses their opinions, saying that there were two opinions: First, the landlords in our village who have not been thoroughly overthrown must be thoroughly defeated after we leave. The second opinion is that we are all militiamen. Now that we are joining the army and going to the front lines to fight Chiang Kai-shek, there are fewer militiamen in the rear. We must further expand the armed forces and pay attention to Little Chiang. Immediately, eighteen young men signed up to join the militia.
　　At the forum in Luzhai, the soldiers said: Many people in our village have not been liberated, and the landlords have not been completely overthrown. In the future, the struggle should take more care of the poor and hired peasants, and don't just take care of us.
　　When bidding farewell to the new soldiers in Da Jing Village, drums and gongs were sounded to send them out of the village. The mother of one soldier said, "Let's shout a few slogans. My son is joining the army, everyone is glorious, for everyone and also for the old mother."
　　During the mass class review, the class consciousness of the soldiers and the masses was further enhanced, making the new soldiers feel even more glorious to be class warriors.

### 当一个光荣的阶级战士　林县的参军运动

　　当一个光荣的阶级战士
  　林县的参军运动
　  肃清旧的思想作风
    这次参军运动，在林县，五天之内就有四千八百三十三个翻身农民报名参加解放军，经过群众的严格审查，批准了三千六百八十五名，为自己的阶级战士。
    参军运动开始的时候，县区都进行了大规模的时事动员，但由于历史上旧的思想和作风的影响，当时首先遇到区村干部对时事问题的思想抵触，认为时事动员是个手段，要求迅速分配任务。如城关区干部说：“一动员时事群众就知道是干啥啦，说不说都一样，反正是要完成任务哩，再说的好，群众不觉悟，也没办法。”针对这种思想展开了批评检讨，进一步研究了时事宣传的目的是啥？并反复说明了反攻形势的发展，这样才克服了旧的任务观点，从思想上树立了时事教育的重要，各区都先后召开了区和联防的主干、各种模范、军烈属和荣退军人的动员大会。四区在一千多人的积极分子会议上贯彻了时事教育，很多人都兴奋的批判了来参加开会时，单纯领任务的思想。和过去扩兵中的老路线。
    经过时事教育以后，大家情绪空前高涨。十一区群众听到各路大军反攻的胜利消息后，一致提出过黄河，渡长江，打到南京捉老蒋。石岗村青年程月章，见到干部从区回来就打听前方的胜利消息。干部告诉他后，他说：“刘邓大军已把蒋介石的腰搂住了，只等咱们去一掀腿就倒了。”
    进行了时事教育，再在各村经过划阶级，更进一步启发了群众的阶级觉悟。因此这次参军是空前的兵多、质量好、情绪高。
  　家庭会
    在时事动员的基础上，村村开家庭会。家庭会的本身是建筑在全体翻身农民的阶级自觉的基础上。克服了过去不依靠广大群众，找寻下几个目标，偷偷摸摸的暗地去动员。和某些地方变相逼兵的方式。
    七泉群众说：“要得早团圆送儿上前线。”家庭会后十六名青年争相报名。任村三街张富存在开家庭会时说：“弟弟你年纪小也还没娶过媳妇哩，我去吧。”他弟弟说：“我年轻不比你强？”父亲说：“都是我儿，我能说叫谁去不叫谁去，不行咱叫干部来讨论吧”。最后还是大的去了。李随玉开家庭会时和他二弟争执不下，大的说我身强力壮，出发有经验，二的说我是号兵，你会啥？结果只得到群众会上表决了。
    八区下翟曲，由于家庭会的召开，转变了落后舆论，动员了过去认为参军中拌脚石的妇女老汉，使他们都成了运动中的积极分子了。六区杨何村妇女杨何花在家庭会议上劝夫参军后，就到他娘家动员他二个弟弟和他男人一齐参军。下翟曲副村长劝弟参军后，他母亲又动员四邻参军，为孩子扩大膀臂兵。在欢送新战士时，很多地方老汉老婆都说：“你们一伙人去了我可放心了，出外互相照顾着点”。
    党员干部积极带头报名，也是这次完成参军任务的重要关键。任村公开党员程牛山、程玉堂，听说打到南京去，活捉蒋介石，他们说：“这是咱的事，咱不去叫谁去。”马上在支部会上商量报了名，影响十二个党员都要去。在党员干部的影响下，大家都准备报名。当天夜里广播台一广播，马上全村就都开起家庭会了。第二天全村开会宣传时事时，主席刚说了几句话，准备报名的人就围满桌子了。主席写的顾不过来，叫着停止停止，越喊越是抢着报，都说可不能误了好机会。程九陆说：“早给俺三孩准备下皮带米袋，等了七八次啦，可不能再误了。”岳江林、王世贵着急的高声喊着：“政治主任，我早给你说我要参军，上次参战误了，这回可得上上我的名哩。”一点钟之内，任村报名的就有六七十人。
  　当一个阶级战士是光荣的
    参军运动中不许有封建尾巴混入，这次不少地方都把新战士交给群众来审查。
    八区郭家窑在二十五名战士报名参军后马上召开全村群众大会让群众审查；经过划阶级查掉了五个封建尾巴，两个病号，一个在蒋政府干过事的。新战士向群众表明态度说：“我们都是自愿去哩，一定好好给大家办事，决不开小差，打不倒老蒋没脸见大家，大家对我们还有啥，都尽管提吧。”群众齐说：“没有啦。”封建尾巴葛双说：“大家如果给我有意见，也给我算算帐吧！我自愿送我儿去参军。”新战士和群众说：“你不要钻空，打老蒋还不够俺干哩。”
    青沙三十个青壮年参军查阶级时查掉了地主汉奸的分家侄儿。芦寨群众说：“参加解放军得有条件哩，打老蒋是自己的事，不能叫地主去。”在审查中查掉了一个破落地主。南木井武委会主任，在全区新战士查阶级会上，也被挤掉了。
    经过审查，又提出了不让新战士带走一个思想包袱。各村都举行了座谈和欢送。干群和战士都提出了保证，有的还订立了合同。
    三寨在欢送座谈会上战士给干部群众提意见时说，有两个意见：第一、咱村未斗透的地主，俺走后一定好好斗垮他。第二个意见是俺们都是民兵，现在参军到前方打老蒋，后方民兵少，一定要再扩大武装，注意小蒋。马上就有十八个青壮年报了名参加民兵。
    芦寨座谈会上战士说：咱村很多人没翻身，地主也没有彻底斗透，以后斗争要多照顾贫雇农，不要光照顾俺。
    大井村在欢送新战士时锣鼓喧天的送出了村外，一个战士母亲说：“咱呼几句口号吧，我儿去参军，大家都光荣，为大家也是为的老母亲。”
    在群众性的查阶级中，更进一步提高了战士和群众的阶级自觉，使新战士更觉得当一个阶级战士的光荣。
