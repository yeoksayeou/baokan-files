Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, 20th: Simultaneously with the great victory along the Zheng-Bian line, the People's Liberation Army again defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Reorganized 5th Division (formerly the 5th Army) in the area of Heti Ridge and Zhang Bridge southwest of Suixian County. After fierce fighting for three days and nights, the PLA smashed dozens of joint attacks by Chiang's bandit infantry, cavalry, artillery, air force, and tank units, killing and wounding over 2,300 of them, and completed the blocking mission. At dawn on the 13th, the 45th Brigade and the 200th Brigade of Chiang's bandit Reorganized 5th Division scurried north from Luyi and Zhecheng, and were immediately met with a fierce counterattack by the People's Liberation Army in the Heti Ridge and Pinggang area. One platoon of our unit repeatedly charged and fought with the enemy all day, smashing five enemy attacks. On the 14th, the enemy desperately attacked Suixian City, and its vanguard advanced to the south bank of the Huiji River, immediately falling into the PLA's fire net. The enemy then concentrated a regiment of troops, and under the coordination of eight tanks and more than a thousand cavalry, pounced on Baimiao, but were defeated by the PLA guarding the area, and scurried back in a panic south of Zhang Bridge and east of Baimiao. The PLA units on both flanks also never allowed the enemy to advance a single step. On the evening of the same day, as we had completed our blocking mission, we voluntarily withdrew from Suixian City. In the past three days and three nights, Chiang's bandit Reorganized 5th Division suffered heavy blows, crawling less than 30 li at a snail's pace, still unable to save the destruction of the Ping-Han and Long-Hai railways, and the annihilation of Chiang's bandits in cities such as Lanfeng, Xuchang, and Minquan.
　　
This newspaper, Ji, Lu, Yu, 20th: The enemy's source of troops is exhausted, and the number of soldiers is empty. According to Chiang's army deserters and Chiang's army liberated by us: When Chiang's bandit 88th Division went to the Central Plains from Ji, Lu, Yu, every place it passed, the garrison troops set up "New Soldier Reception Centers" (specializing in grabbing soldiers), checking pedestrians at stations and important crossings. When they encountered soldiers from other units, they first demanded identification documents, immediately tore them up, and pointed them out as deserters, taking them to the "Reception Center," changing them into their own unit's uniforms, and locking them in solitary confinement. When marching, they became their soldiers. When the Reorganized 5th Division was in Shangqiu, it grabbed soldiers from the 24th Division, because the 24th Division was a miscellaneous unit and could not resist. Once the 5th Division grabbed as many as a company of soldiers from the 24th Division. However, even grabbing like this was not enough to keep up with the desertions. When the 88th Division was stationed in Fengxian, Yutai, and Jinxiang, it grabbed many new soldiers. The two companies of the 63rd Regiment alone captured nearly 300 people in Jinxiang, but now there are less than 100 left. The 147th Brigade replenished a battalion in Yutai, but later fewer than a company remained after desertions. On the way north of the 147th Brigade, after grabbing and capturing, a company had only seventy or eighty people, and at most less than a hundred, half less than the full quota. Due to the shortage of troops, they had to patch things up haphazardly. The 5th Division, Chiang Kai-shek's mobile main force, is in a situation where it is short of troops and unable to cope, and has to be dismantled and used. The 287th Regiment of the 96th Brigade was originally left in Laiwu for defense, and was transferred to Xuzhou on November 2nd for rest, and soon went to Jinxiang to "relieve the siege." When Yuduong was in trouble, the 200th Division was assigned to Luo Guangwen's command and went to the Pinghan Line. It was not until November 16 that it scurried east in a panic to reinforce Longhai. Now the division is scattered in Xuzhou, Luyi, Zhecheng, Mengcheng, and Xiaoxian. Not only is the strength scattered, but at the same time, the old soldiers are less than one-third, and the rest are all new soldiers who were grabbed. In the past, the 5th Division was all southerners, but now there are people from all over Su, Lu, Yu. In the 63rd Regiment of the 147th Brigade of the 88th Division, only the squad leader is an old soldier, and in the 61st Regiment, new soldiers account for more than two-thirds. Due to the increasing number of new soldiers, the morale and combat effectiveness of Chiang's bandits are increasingly declining.

　　我军阻击西援汴郑线蒋匪
    歼整五师二千三百
    匪三天三夜爬进不到三十里
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十日电】与郑汴沿线大捷同时，解放军复于睢县西南河堤岭、张桥一线击溃西援之蒋匪整编第五师（原第五军），激战三昼夜，粉碎蒋匪步、骑、炮、空、坦克各兵种数十次之联合进攻，毙伤其二千三百余名，完成阻击任务。十三日拂晓，蒋匪整五师四十五旅及二百旅，由鹿邑、柘城向北窜犯，当于河堤岭、平岗一线遭解放军猛烈反击。我某连一个排与敌反复冲杀竟日，粉碎敌五次进攻。十四日敌拼力犯睢县城，其先头部队进至惠济河南岸，立即陷入解放军火网中，敌乃集中一团兵力，在八辆坦克、千余骑兵配合下向白庙猛扑，但为扼守该地之解放军击溃，狼狈向张桥以南、白庙以东回窜。解放军两翼部队亦始终未让敌人前进一步。是日晚，我因已完成阻击任务，主动撤离睢县城。三天三夜以来，蒋匪整五师遭惨重打击，龟步爬进不及三十里，仍挽救不了平汉、陇海两大铁路的被破坏，及兰封、许昌、民权等城蒋匪被歼的命运。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】敌兵源枯竭，兵额空虚。据蒋军逃兵及被我解放之蒋军谈：蒋匪八十八师由冀鲁豫往中原开时，每经一处，驻军都设有“新兵招待所”（专门抓兵的），在车站、重要渡口检查行人，遇着别的部队军人先索证明文件，立即撕毁，指为开小差的，带到“招待所”，换上他本部的军衣，关入禁闭室，行军时就成了他的兵。整五师在商邱的时候，见了二十四师的兵就抓，因二十四师系杂牌，无法抵制，有一次五师抓二十四师的兵便有一个连之多。可是这样抓还不够跑的多。八十八师驻防丰县、鱼台、金乡时，抓了许多新兵，只六三团两个连在金乡捕的就近三百人，可是现在剩下的还不足百人。六二旅在鱼台补充一个营，后来跑的剩下不到一个连。一四七旅北开途中，连抓带捕，一个连只七八十人，多者不足百人，和足额定数相差一半。由于兵力不足，便只有胡拉乱凑，剜肉补疮。五师是蒋介石的机动主力，处于兵力不足、无法应付的局面下，也不得不拆散使用。九六旅之二八七团原留在莱芜守备，于十一月二日调到徐州休息，不久又开至金乡“解围”。二百师于豫东吃紧时，拨归罗广文指挥，开到平汉线去。到十一月十六日，始又狼狈东窜增援陇海。现该师分散于徐州、鹿邑、柘城、蒙城、萧县一带。不但力量分散，同时老兵还不到三分之一，其余都是抓的新兵。以前五师都是南方人，现苏鲁豫各地人都有。八十八师一四七旅六三团只班长是老兵，六一团新兵占三分之二强。由于新兵成份日增，使蒋匪士气与战斗力愈益衰颓。
