The purchase of products by cooperatives will increase. These products should find broad outlets among consumers. The government's decision intends to open shops and open-air markets of various sizes in cities and workers' residential areas. At the same time, the cooperatives decided to sell food and industrial products at market prices and not exceeding the pricing of state-owned goods.

The two basic systems in Soviet commerce—state-owned and cooperative—will compete with each other in the cause of better serving the residents. This competition for developing the creativity and independence of state-owned commerce and cooperative commercial organizations will promote them to improve their work.

In the case of insufficient consumer goods, the monopoly position of this or that commercial system traps its staff in complacency. For example, it is known that in 1930, consumer cooperatives were the dominant commercial system. Its sales accounted for two-thirds of the total domestic retail commodity trade at that time. The monopoly position of consumer cooperatives created a morbid condition for its leaders and deteriorated cooperative work.

In his report at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930, Comrade Stalin directly linked the issue of raising the real wages of workers with improving the work of commercial enterprises. He said that the achievement of raising real wages could be enormous. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "If this achievement is not made, then generally speaking, this is the sin of bureaucracy of our supply organs, and specifically, first of all, the sin of bureaucracy of consumer cooperatives... Cooperatives systematically attacked private commerce and became monopolists in the field of commerce. This is naturally very good. But this kind of monopoly often becomes unfavorable to consumers, which is not good. Obviously, disregarding its almost monopoly position in commerce, cooperatives prefer to supply workers with goods that are more profitable and have more 'income' (sundries, etc.), and avoid supplying them with goods that have less 'income', even if they are more needed by workers (agricultural products). Therefore, workers have to seek to satisfy nearly 25 percent of their needs for agricultural products in the expensive private market."

Many years have passed since then. The development of state-owned commerce has eliminated the monopoly of consumer cooperatives and squeezed it out of urban commodity trade. Now the cooperative is tasked with developing its own trade in cities together with state-owned commerce. This approach, first, strengthens the role of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in supplying urban residents, and second, is responsible for reducing prices in collective farm markets. Therefore, it is clear how significant the development of cooperative trade in cities and workers' residential areas is for improving the material welfare of laborers, especially for selling vegetables, fruits, potatoes, milk, and other domestic products that are not lacking in the network.

From November 1946 to March 1947, the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives opened nearly 5,500 commercial enterprises in cities and workers' residential areas. As of March 1 this year, consumer cooperatives purchased agricultural products totaling more than 1.5 billion rubles. However, this is only the first step. Important work lies ahead.

In the implementation of the government's decision of November 9, 1946, very serious shortcomings were manifested in the work of the entire system of consumer cooperatives, from the Central Union to the initial links. The development of cooperative commerce in heavy industrial centers, especially in metallurgical, coal, and petroleum industries, is still unsatisfactory. For example, the three-month plan for commodity trade was only 21 percent completed in Novosibirsk, only 35.6 percent completed in Sverdlovsk, and only 45 percent completed in Molotov. In the Karaganda coal mining area, consumer cooperatives sold a total of only 8.9 tons of meat, 0.5 tons of sausage, 0.7 tons of potatoes, and 0.5 tons of vegetables by February 1, 1947.

Many villages are standing outside the work of collecting agricultural products. In the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, only 33 out of 62 villages participated in the collection work. In all these areas, especially in the hinterland, there are commodity resources. But in order to collect them and hand them over to consumers, the creativity of local commercial workers is needed, being good at resolutely transforming from the old distribution methods to skillfully expanded trade.

The collection, production, and trade of cooperative organizations have formed an important supplementary source of supply for residents in the post-war period. Industrial cooperatives, disabled veterans' cooperatives, and local industries have greatly increased the production of daily necessities. In 1947, in addition to the products manufactured by the state's large-scale industry, the residents of the Soviet Union received approximately 3 million pairs of shoes, more than 69 million meters of textiles, approximately 11 million pairs of felt boots, approximately 40 million pairs of socks and stockings, and many other consumer necessities from industrial cooperatives and local industries.

State-owned commerce remains the basic leading and dominant mode of trade in the post-war Five-Year Plan. For example, the retail trade plan for state-owned commerce in 1947 is 251.6 billion rubles, the trade of consumer cooperatives in rural areas is 55.5 billion rubles, and the trade of consumer cooperatives in cities is 17.5 billion rubles. This year, a total of 325 billion rubles of goods will be sold to residents through state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. The summary of the completion of the first quarter plan of 1947 showed that commodity trade increased by 25 percent compared with the first quarter of 1946 (at comparable prices).

Socialist production in urban and rural areas is the foundation for this development of Soviet commerce. It is expected that the industrial sectors producing consumer goods will accelerate their development in 1947. The output of light industry and textile industry should increase by more than 27 percent this year compared with the level of 1946. The decision on "Measures for the High Tide of Agriculture in the Post-War Period" adopted by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) proposed to guarantee the high tide of agriculture as the state's most urgent task, which will allow to manufacture abundant food for residents in the shortest period, to manufacture raw materials for light industry, and to accumulate the necessary national food reserves and raw material reserves.

Increasing commodity production, manufacturing abundant products, developing various Soviet commerce, and systematically reducing prices will not only guarantee the restoration of the pre-war level of people's consumer goods, but will also greatly exceed this level by the end of the Five-Year Plan.

　　战后五年计划中的苏联商业　（续完）
    由合作社购买产品的事情将会增长。这些产品应当在消费者中找到广阔的出路。政府的决定打算在城市和工人住宅区开辟大小商店和露天商场。同时合作社决定接照市价和不超过国家商品的定价来出售食品和工业品。
    苏维埃商业中两个基本系统——国营的和合作社的——将在更好地为居民服务的事业上彼此竞赛。这种发展国营商业和合作社商业组织的创造性和独立性的竞赛，将推动它们改进工作。
    在消费品不足的情形下，这个或那个商业系统的垄断地位，陷它们的工作人员于自满。例如，大家知道，在一九三○年，消费合作社是居支配地位的商业系统。它的出售额为当时国内零售商品贸易额全部的三分之二。消费合作社的垄断地位产生了它领导者的病态，使合作社工作恶化。
    斯大林同志于一九三○年在联共（布）十六次代表大会的报告中，直接把提高职工实际工资问题同改善商业企业的工作联系起来。他说，提高实际工资这一事情的成就可能是巨大的。斯大林同志指出：“如果这个成就没有做到，那么一般说来这是我们供给机关的官僚主义的罪恶，特殊说来首先是消费合作社的官僚主义的罪恶………合作社有系统地打击私营商业并成为商业领域的垄断者。这自然很好。可是这种垄断常常弄得不利于消费者，这是不好的。显然，合作社不顾自己在商业中的几乎垄断地位，宁愿供给工人获利较多的、‘收入’较多的商品（零星物品等等），而避免供给他们‘收入’较少的商品，那怕是对于工人更需要的商品（农产品）。因此工人不得不在高价的私人市场上来求满足其约近百分之二十五的农产品的需要”。
    从那时起经过了好多年了。国营商业的发展排除了消费合作社的垄断，并且把它从城市商品贸易中挤出去。现在合作社负有使命同国营商业一起在城市中发展自己的贸易。这种办法，第一、加强了国营商业和合作社商业在供给城市居民中的作用，而第二、负责减低集体农庄市场的物价。因此，显然的，在城市和工人住宅区发展合作社贸易，对于提高劳动者的物质福利，特别是对于出售蔬菜、水果、洋芋、牛奶以及其他国内产物网中并不缺乏的东西，具有何等巨大意义。
    从一九四六年十一月到一九四七年三月这一期间，消费合作社中央联合会在城市和工人住宅区开辟了约近五千五百所商业企业。到今年三月一日止，消费合作社购买了总数在十五亿卢布以上的农产品。然而这只是第一步。重要的工作还在前面。
    在执行政府一九四六年十一月九日的决定中，在消费合作社整个系统的工作中，从中央联合会起到最初的环节止，表现了非常严重的缺点。在重工业中心，特别在冶金业、煤业和石油业中心，合作社商业的发展，至今还不能令人满意。例如，商品贸易额的三个月计划，在诺沃西比尔斯克仅完成了百分之二十一，在斯维得洛夫斯克仅完成了百分之三十五·六，在莫洛托夫城仅完成了百分之四十五。在卡拉干丁斯克煤矿区消费合作社到一九四七年二月一日总共只卖了八·九吨肉，○·五吨腊肠，○·七吨洋芋和○·五吨蔬菜。
    许多村子站在收集农产物工作之外。在阿捷拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国，六十二个村子中参加收集工作的只有三十三个。在所有这些区域，尤其是在腹地，都有商品资源。可是为了收集它们和交给消费者，需要地方商业工作者的创造性，善于坚决从旧的分配办法转变到机巧地扩展的贸易。
    合作社组织的收集、生产和贸易形成了战后时期居民供给的重要补充来源，产业合作社、残废军人合作社和地方工业大大提高着日用必需品的生产。苏维埃国家的居民，超出国家大工业的制造品之外，在一九四七年从产业合作社和地方工业得到了约近三百万双鞋，六千九百万公尺以上的纺织品，约近一千一百万双的毡靴、约近四千万双的袜子和短袜及许多其他消费必需品。
    国营商业在战后五年计划中依旧是基本领导的和占优势的贸易方式。例如，一九四七年国营商业的零售贸易计划为二千五百十六亿卢布，消费合作社在乡村的贸易为五百五十五亿卢布，消费合作社在城市的贸易为一百七十五亿卢布。今年经过国营商业和合作社商业总共将出售给居民三千二百五十亿卢布的商品。完成一九四七年第一季计划的总结，表明了商品贸易较之一九四六年第一季增长百分之二十五（按比较价格）。
    城乡社会主义生产是苏维埃商业这种发展的基础。预期在一九四七年生产消费品的工业部门将加速发展。轻工业和纺织工业的产量在今年应当较之一九四六年的水平增加百分之二十七强。联共（布）中央全会所通过的“关于战后时期农业高涨的办法”的决定，提出保证农业的高涨为国家最迫切的任务，这种农业的高涨将容许在最短期间替居民制造丰富的食品，替轻工业制造原料，并且积累必需的国家粮食后备与原料后备。
    增加商品生产，制造丰富产品，发展各种苏维埃商业，和有系统地减低物价，不仅保证恢复人民消费品的战前水平，而且到五年计划底将大大超过这个水平。
