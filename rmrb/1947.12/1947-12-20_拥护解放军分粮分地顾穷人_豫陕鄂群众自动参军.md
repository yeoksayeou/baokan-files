    Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 18th: In the newly liberated areas of Linru and Baofeng, the masses, benefiting from the democratic government's opening of granaries to relieve poverty and the equal distribution of land, have seen over two hundred people voluntarily join the People's Liberation Army in recent days. After the second liberation of Baofeng County town on the 2nd, in the first seven days, on just one street alone, eleven young people voluntarily joined the army. On the morning of the 10th, amidst the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, over a thousand people escorted those joining the army into the ranks. They all wore red flowers, rode horses in a parade, with two large flags leading the procession. One flag read, "The Poor Want to Overturn Their Lives, Join the People's Liberation Army"; the other read, "Oppose the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Army's Forced Grain Requisition, Forced Levies, and Draft, Support the People's Liberation Army's Distribution of Grain and Land to Help the Poor." On that day, as the garrison held a celebration conference, the new recruits were welcomed into the venue after the parade and received enthusiastic cheers and hospitality along with the heroes. The newly elected street leader guaranteed at the meeting that the families of soldiers would not face difficulties. Four citizens gave speeches on stage, one of whom, a Hui Muslim, particularly praised the liberated areas' policy of respecting ethnic minorities and religious freedom, and called on Hui people to join the army.

    拥护解放军分粮分地顾穷人
    豫陕鄂群众自动参军
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十八日电】临汝、宝丰新解放区群众，在民主政府开仓济贫与平分土地中，连日已有二百余人自动参加解放军。宝丰县城二日为解放军二次解放后，最初七天中仅某一条大街上，就有十一名青年自动参军。十日清晨在锣鼓鞭炮声中，千余群众簇拥着参军的人入伍。他们都佩带红花，骑马游行，行列以两面大旗为前导，一面写着“穷人要翻身，参加解放军”；另一面写着“反对蒋匪军逼粮逼款又抓兵，拥护解放军分粮分地顾穷人”。是日，时值城防驻军召开贺功大会，新战士游行后，即被迎入会场与功臣们一起受到了热烈的欢呼和招待。新选街长在会上保证不使军属困难，有四个市民登台演讲，其中一位回教徒特别赞扬解放区尊重少数民族及宗教自由的政策，并号召回民参军。
