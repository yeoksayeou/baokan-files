Exploiting "Voluntarism" to Randomly Squeeze Out "Sharps"
Poor and Hired Peasants Suffer Grievances Everywhere
— A Mutual Aid Investigation in Chongyi Village, Wu'an
Li Yaonan
This year, due to the Volunteer Movement and conscription in Wu'an, the county did not conduct a general summary of production work. Each district only made summaries for typical villages. Before the summary, the leadership believed that Chongyi Village was a village with good mutual aid, so they specifically inspected this village. Due to the short inspection time (only about ten days), it was not possible to fully understand the situation. Only the Sun Lao Zhuang, Sun Shuanlin, Wang Quanyi, Sun Suozhu, and Jin Ren'an groups were investigated. This material was obtained from holding discussion meetings with different types of households (poor and hired, including widowed and orphaned, bachelors, those with labor, those without livestock, those with livestock, and artisans). This material can only illustrate that many problems exist in the mutual aid groups in Chongyi and cannot be used to represent the overall mutual aid situation in Chongyi based on these five groups alone.

The whole village has 140 old middle-peasant households with 100 head of livestock. Seventy percent of the households own livestock. There are 280 poor and hired peasant households (not very precise), with 40 head of livestock. Households without livestock account for 80 percent. Last autumn, during the rush to sow wheat, the spirit of caring for orphans and the poor and hired during the land reform movement was continued. However, there was insufficient attention paid to uniting middle peasants and ensuring equivalent exchange. It was based solely on caring for orphans and the poor and hired. In the order of sowing wheat, orphans were sown first, followed by households without livestock, and finally households with livestock. As a result, orphans and households without livestock were sown with early wheat, while middle peasants with livestock were sown with late wheat. Later, due to the impact of conscription and local cadres, not enough wheat was sown. This year, middle peasants harvested very little wheat, leading to dissatisfaction with the poor and hired (especially the poor and hired without labor, orphans and widows). This spring, some livestock-owning households were unwilling to feed their livestock and wanted to push them off a cliff to die. This problem had not been resolved during this year's spring plowing, and middle peasants held a negative attitude towards mutual aid and were unwilling to participate.

When the mutual aid was rectified in April, the leadership only saw that livestock-owning households were unwilling to provide mutual aid to orphans and households without livestock, but did not study the reasons for their unwillingness, which was reluctance to suffer losses. The problem was not solved by improving the relationship between middle peasants and the poor and hired based on the principle of equivalent exchange, and consolidating the mutual aid groups. It was believed that the main problem was the lack of voluntarism, and the rectification of the mutual aid groups was solely based on emphasizing voluntary combination. As a result, middle peasants with livestock squeezed orphans and a portion of households without livestock out of the groups. A total of 94 households were squeezed out of the entire village. Not only did this leave these squeezed-out households unable to produce, but they were also given a label called "squeezed sharps."

After the voluntary combination, it was the season for rushing to sow. Hao Gouyin's family, an orphan, was squeezed out of the group. Not only could they not rush to sow their 4.4 mu of land, but they couldn't even find livestock to plow the land. Everyone else had already sown the first two rows of millet, but he only plowed and sowed four rows of seedlings in May. In total, he harvested three dou of corn and three sheng of grain, and the wage-grain alone cost him 45 jin plus 4,000 yuan. There were many such households in the village.

There were also some orphans who were brought into the groups by their relatives. Wang Tonglin's family was brought into Jin Ren'an's group by his brother, Changlin. However, due to the power held by livestock-owning households, they sought cheap labor from orphans in exchange for work. It was stipulated that spinning a catty and a half of cotton could be used to offset one male laborer's work (a catty and a half of cotton yields a profit of over a thousand yuan, equivalent to about ten jin of rice, while a man's work is only worth six jin of rice). Old middle peasant Jin Suixin asked Wang Tonglin's family to spin cotton to offset labor. They refused because they felt it was a loss and were willing to pay rice instead. They received no reply, so old Suixin refused to let them use his livestock to plow the land. In the end, he even squeezed Wang Tonglin's family out of the group.

Poor peasant Jin Shuangcheng was in a group with old middle peasant Lao Fengtang before the mutual aid rectification. In the spring, he filled trenches for Lao Fengtang for two workdays without receiving any work-grain. Lao Fengtang refused to cultivate the land jointly but only asked Jin Shuangcheng to do the work, without providing any work-grain. When he sought help from the cadres, he received no resolution. Lao Shuangcheng was forced to leave the group and became a "sharp."

Poor peasant Huang Maicheng jointly bought a head of livestock with Sun Shuanlin. Sun Shuanlin was an activist with power and status. Disputes arose over jointly feeding the livestock. Huang Maicheng, who had little land, advocated for allocating fodder based on the area of land, while Sun Shuanlin, who had more land, advocated for allocating fodder based on shares. After the cadres resolved the issue in accordance with Huang Maicheng's opinion, Sun Shuanlin was dissatisfied. During the voluntary combination, he became the head of the joint mutual aid group and refused to let Huang Maicheng join the group, calling him a "sharp" and squeezing him out. When it came to sowing wheat, Huang Maicheng went to Sun Shuanlin to use his livestock, but the wages were doubled (plowing one mu of land in the group cost nine jin of rice, but he had to pay thirteen and a half jin). Huang Maicheng had no choice. After saying countless kind words, he was finally allowed to join the group. He was an old man, and Sun Shuanlin, in order to retaliate against him, specifically assigned him heavy work, making him pull the plow during planting.

Poor peasant Sun Yuzhong, who did not have livestock, was squeezed out of the mutual aid. When hoeing the land, he asked Sun Suozhu to allocate someone to help, but because he was not in the group, the wages were 50% higher (six jin of rice in the group, he had to pay eight jin). In May, when threshing the grain, in addition to the wages, they also took away the wheat chaff. The poor and hired suffered losses everywhere.

Mao Gang is a poor artisan who knows how to mend pots. If he doesn't give the group a 30% cut of his earnings, they won't let him go out to mend pots. After he left to mend pots, the group didn't allocate anyone to help him sow wheat in the autumn after harvesting the grain. After waiting for four or five days, Mao Gang's father used his daughter's livestock to roughly sow the land. He was even criticized by the group for using livestock from outside the group to roughly sow the land.

In short, this year's voluntarism has allowed middle peasants to gain power and seek advantages from the poor and hired. Although the poor and hired suffer losses, they dare not leave the group because without mutual aid and livestock, they cannot cultivate the land. They have to endure the losses.

Before the inspection, the village cadres were very complacent about the village's production, believing that the "voluntary" combination, "squeezing sharps," and the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations were great victories. They even held a hostile attitude towards the squeezed-out poor and hired, calling them "sharps" and saying they were unyielding after being squeezed out, and were unmoved by the losses suffered by the poor and hired in mutual aid. After the inspection, the village cadres realized that this year's production had not served the poor and hired, felt very sorry for the poor and hired, and decided to focus on organizing the poor and hired to engage in pot-mending production in this winter production study. (Editor's Note: This cannot be just empty talk; there must be organizational guarantees.)

    借口“自愿”，乱挤“尖头”
    贫雇到处吃亏受气
    ——武安崇义村互助调查
    李耀南
    武安今年由于义运和参军，全县没有普遍的总结生产工作，各区只作了典型村总结。崇义村在总结以前，领导上认为是互助好的村，因此特别将这村检查了一下。在检查中因时间短（只有十来天），没有可能全面了解，只作了孙老庄、孙拴林、王全义、孙所柱、靳任安等五个组的调查。这个材料是从分类型户（贫雇里孤寡，光棍，有劳力，没牲口，有牲口，手艺人等）开座谈会，谈出来的。这材料只能说明崇义的互助组里是存在着很多问题，不能以此五个组，来代表崇义的互助全面情况。
    全村旧中农一百四十户，有牲口一百头，百分之七十户有牲口，贫雇农二百八十户（不很精确），有牲口四十头，没牲口户占百分之八十。去秋突击种麦时，是继续土改运动中照顾孤寡照顾贫雇的精神，对团结中农，等价交换掌握的不够，单纯的从照顾孤寡与贫雇出发，在种麦的次序上，是先种孤寡再种没牲口户，有牲口户最后种，结果孤寡与没牲口户种了直麦，挨到中农有牲口户身上种了晚麦，后因参军地干等影响，也没有种足。今年五月中农收麦很少，对贫雇（特别是没劳力贫雇孤寡）不满，今春有的牲口户不愿喂牲口，想把牲口推到崖下跌死，这个问题在今年春耕时还没得到解决，中农对互助抱着消极态度不愿参加。
    四月整顿互助时，领导上只是看到有牲口户不愿给孤寡没牲口户互助，而没有研究其不自愿的原因是不愿吃亏，没有从等价着手解决这个问题中改善中农与贫雇关系，巩固互助组。认为主要问题是不自愿，单纯的强调自愿结合来整顿互助组，结果中农有牲口户，把孤寡与一部分没牲口户从组里挤了出来，全村共挤出九十四户，不但弄的这些被挤出的户没法生产，并且还给戴上个帽子叫“挤尖头”。
    自愿结合后，正值抢种，孤寡郝狗银家被挤出组，四亩四分地不但不能抢种，连犁地也找不下牲口，人家都种上头二耧谷子，他五月才犁地种的四耧苗子，一共打了三斗玉茭三升谷子，光工资米便出了四十五斤还有洋四千元。全村这样户很多。
    也有一部分孤寡靠着本家带进了组里，王同林家倒是靠着他兄弟常林参加了靳任安组，但由于有牲口户当权，在换工上找孤寡便宜，规定纺花斤五两顶一个男工（斤五两花利润一千多元，合十来斤米，男人一工才六斤米）。老中农靳随心，叫王同林家给纺花顶工，人家嫌吃亏愿出米不愿纺花，没有答复，老随心便不叫用人家牲口犁地，最后还把王同林家挤出组。
    贫农靳双成，未整顿互助前给旧中农老凤堂在一个组里，春天给老凤堂填壕两个工不给工米，伙代耕地老凤堂不干光叫靳双成去做，工米不给，找干部也没得到解决，老双成被迫出了组，落了个“尖头”。
    贫农黄买成给孙拴林伙买一个牲口，孙拴林是个积极分子，有权有地位，在伙喂牲口上发生了纠纷。黄买成地少主张按亩摊草料，孙拴林地多主张按股来摊，后经干部解决，按黄买成意见，孙拴林不满意。在自愿结合时，他当了联合互助组长，不让黄买成入组，说黄买成是“尖头”，挤出组外。种麦时黄买成去找孙拴林用牲口，工资得加倍（组里犁一亩地九斤米，他用十三斤半），黄买成没法，好话说了千千万，才入了组；他本是个老汉，孙拴林为了报复他，串麦时专门分配重活叫他拉耧。
    贫农孙玉重，没有牲口被挤出互助，锄地时找孙所柱给拨人，因不在组，工资得高一半（组里六斤他出八斤）。五月给打场，除出工资外，还把麦糠拿去。贫雇到处吃亏。
    毛缸是个贫苦手艺工人，会补锅，不给组里三七分红不叫出去，补锅走后，秋天割了谷子组里不给拨人种麦子，等了四、五天，毛缸爹才用闺女的牲口茬耩上，就因此还受了组里一顿批评，嫌毛缸爹用了组外牲口，茬耩了地。
    总之今年的自愿，是使中农掌了权，来找贫雇的便宜，贫雇虽然吃亏，也不敢出组，因一离互助没牲口用，便不能种地了，吃亏也只好忍耐着。
    未检查前，村干部对该村的生产抱着很大的自满情绪，认为“自愿”结合“挤尖头”，与农副结合是很大的胜利，对被挤出的贫雇还抱着仇视态度，说是“尖头”，挤出不屈，对贫雇在互助中的吃亏毫不动心。经过检查以后，村干部才认识到今年生产没有给贫雇服务，觉得太对不起贫雇，在这次研究冬季生产时，决定着重组织贫雇补锅生产。（编者按：这不能说空话，需有组织保证。）
