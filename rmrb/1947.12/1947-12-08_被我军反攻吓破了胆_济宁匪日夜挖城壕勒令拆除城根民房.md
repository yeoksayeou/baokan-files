(This newspaper, dated December 6th, from the Jilu豫 region reports): Fear and darkness shroud Jining, and the residents of Jining are unable to live normal lives. On November 4th, the Jining City-published puppet "Lu Southwest People's Daily" boasted that "Jiaxing and Juye are as solid as gold." However, in less than half a month, these two cities were recovered by our forces, which greatly shocked the Chiang bandits. They hurriedly gathered laborers and released the water from Machang Lake and the Grand Canal into the city moat. But still feeling it was not "safe," they ordered the laborers to jump into the cold water, which was as deep as their thighs, to dig the moat deeper and wider day and night. A curfew was imposed very early every night, and at the same time, each household was ordered to hang a lamp at the front door that would burn all night. The houses at the base of the city walls on the north bank of the Grand Canal were forcibly demolished by the city defense department. The teams at the four gates did not dare to stay overnight and hid north of Caoqiao. The newspaper on the 5th also published a telegram from the puppet Jining City Council to Wang Yaowu, the puppet Shandong Chairman, confessing that: "This year, one-fifth of the county has been affected by floods. In the flooded areas, nine out of ten houses are empty, and men, women, old, and young have fled to other places. Grain cannot be collected, and local organs have not been paid for more than four months, and education has also been suspended. However, the county government and the provincial government ordered the 'requisition' of grain, and the collectors are as anxious as if they were rushing burning houses. Chiang's 'Ministry of National Defense' also sent personnel to purchase 400,000 catties of wheat. After more than a month, very little has been purchased, and now the provincial government has come to requisition 420,000 catties of wheat... In addition, the blatant exploitation of villagers by village chiefs, and the extortion of merchants by security captains, are endless." After Zhongqian Township was occupied by the Chiang bandits this spring, each male was charged one tael of silver and had already paid more than 800 catties of wheat. The security captain put a large amount of Chiang currency into Hongda Tea House, saying he wanted to buy grain. After four days, the price of wheat suddenly rose, and the captain asked the tea house to pay the full amount of wheat at the price on the day of payment. The tea house had to pay the wheat in full while swallowing its anger. In this situation, the citizens only hope that the People's Liberation Army will recover the city as soon as possible.

(Another dispatch) The Chiang bandits in Heze are also extremely panicked. The soldiers are discussing three possible paths: 1. Abandon the city and run away quickly; 2. Revolt and join the People's Liberation Army; 3. Hope that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them quickly; there is no other way to go.

　　被我军反攻吓破了胆
    济宁匪日夜挖城壕勒令拆除城根民房
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】恐惧黑暗笼罩着济宁，济市居民已无法生活。十一月四日，济宁市出版的伪“鲁西南民报”上刚刚吹嘘过“嘉祥、钜野固若金汤”，但不到半个月，该两城即被我收复，这给了蒋匪很大的震惊，赶忙抓集民夫，把马场湖及运河之水放开，注入城壕里去。但还觉得不“保险”，又令民夫跳进深及大腿根的冷水中，日以继夜的再把壕沟挖深挖宽。每晚很早便戒严，同时令各户在大门首悬挂彻夜不熄的灯。运河北岸城墙根的民房，城防部迫令拆除。四关队伍到夜晚不敢住宿，均躲藏到草桥以北去。该报五日又载伪济宁市参议会致电伪山东主席王耀武，供出：“今年全县水灾区达五分之一，被淹区域十室九空，男女老幼均逃亡他地，食粮无法征收，地方机关均停薪四个月有奇，教育亦形停顿。而县府本省府令‘征购’食粮，催征人急如星火，蒋记‘国防部’又派员来采购小麦四十万斤。为时月余，采购无几，今省府又来征购小麦四十二万斤……。此外，如乡长对乡民的暴敛，保安队长对商家的讹诈等，层出不穷。”仲浅乡今春被蒋匪侵占后，每丁银一两。已缴小麦八百余斤。保安队长以大量蒋币放到鸿大茶庄，说要买粮食。经过四日以后，小麦突涨，该队长乃向茶庄按交款之日价钱要如数的小麦。茶庄在忍气吞声中不得不按数交麦。市民在此情景下，唯盼解放军早去收复该城。
    （又电）菏泽蒋匪亦恐慌万状，士兵纷纷议论着三条出路：一、放弃快跑；二、起义找解放军；三、盼解放军快去解放他们；此外无路可走。
