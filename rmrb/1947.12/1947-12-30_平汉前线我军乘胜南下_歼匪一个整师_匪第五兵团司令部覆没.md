　　Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Front, 28th Urgent Telegram: Parts of the Su Lu Yu Wan and Yu Shaanxi E Liberation Army, following the great victories in disrupting the Pinghan and Longhai lines, capitalized on their victory and advanced southward along the Pinghan Railway. From the morning of the 25th to the evening of the 26th, after two days of fierce fighting, they completely annihilated the Fifth Army Group Headquarters of the Chiang bandits, which attempted to reinforce Yancheng, and its entire 3rd Division (minus one regiment), in the Zhu Wang Zhai and Jin Gang Si area, 15 miles south of Xiping. This is another great victory of the coordinated operations of the two major field armies. Detailed battle results are still being tallied.
    Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Front, 28th Telegram: The Front Headquarters has just issued Public Communiqué No. 32, announcing: Our army, starting at 8:00 AM on the 22nd, after a day and night of fighting, captured the Liuhe Station and Liuhe Ji on the Longhai Railway.
