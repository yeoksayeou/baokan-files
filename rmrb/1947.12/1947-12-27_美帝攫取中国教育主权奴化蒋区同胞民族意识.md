　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th – Comprehensive Report: While plundering Chinese military bases and invading China's economic and political interests, U.S. imperialism is seizing China's educational sovereignty under the guise of "Sino-American cultural exchange" and "Sino-American goodwill," engaging in cultural and ideological aggression, and numbing the national consciousness of compatriots in the Chiang-controlled areas. Since the signing of the "Agreement on the U.S. Educational Foundation in China" by Chiang and the U.S. in Nanjing on the 10th of last month, a board of directors with five American directors "guiding and supervising" the implementation of the agreement was established in Nanjing on the 16th of this month. In addition, Mr. Hulse, director of the Cultural Liaison Department of the U.S. Embassy in Chiang, arrived in Nanjing on the 15th to actively carry out cultural aggression work. On December 1st, a U.S. State Department official told a reporter from Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency that the foundation's funds might be used to assist "Chinese (Chiang) and American scholars" and "exchange students" in studying "long-term U.S. aid to China (Chiang) methods." The U.S. imperialism's intention to use this agreement to assist its military, economic, and political aggression has been fully exposed.
　　
　　In the "Relief Agreement" signed between the U.S. and Chiang on October 27th, the U.S. imperialists ordered their lackey Chiang Kai-shek to "permit and arrange full and continuous publicity," and that all U.S. relief materials and items or containers made therefrom "should be marked, stamped, branded, or labeled in a prominent position as far as possible," attempting to flaunt their false benevolence. The Methodist Episcopal Church, as a pawn of U.S. cultural aggression, is also strengthening its activities, planning to expand its activities in China with $457,000 over four years.
　　
　　In order to further attempt to sell the souls of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to their American masters, the traitorous and nation-selling Chiang Kai-shek is following orders to implement the U.S. imperialist aggression policy with various shameless actions. On December 15th, the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education stated that it had purchased $300,000 worth of audio-visual education equipment from the United States. Next year, "social education" will focus on beautifying film education. Audio-visual education guidance offices have already been established in Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Henan, Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Northern Liaoning, Beijing, Shanghai, and Ping. Those that have not been established will be established next year, and preparations are being made to train audio-visual personnel from various provinces and cities to facilitate the use of U.S. imperialism.
　　
　　On October 24th, the Chiang bandit Executive Yuan passed the Chiang bandit's new "Publication Law," which is full of dictatorial and traitorous stench, adding two new articles: "Foreign nationals may apply for the publication of publications in accordance with the provisions of this Law" (Chapter 1, Article 8) and "Publications shall not contain records that harm the reputation of the head of state of this country or friendly countries" (Chapter 4, Article 22). According to prior disclosures by foreign news agencies, the former was added at the request of the United States to facilitate U.S. cultural aggression, while the latter is clearly an attempt to prohibit the growing public opinion among the Chinese and American people against U.S. imperialism and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek.

### 美帝攫取中国教育主权奴化蒋区同胞民族意识

　　美帝攫取中国教育主权奴化蒋区同胞民族意识
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：美帝国主义在掠夺中国军事基地、侵略中国经济、政治权益的同时，正在“中美文化交流”、“中美亲善”等虚伪幌子下攫取中国教育主权，进行文化思想侵略，奴化蒋管区同胞民族意识的活动。自上月十日蒋美在南京签订“美国对华教育基金协定”后，以美国董事五人“指导监督”该协定实施之董事会，已于本月十六日在南京成立。而美驻蒋大使馆文化联络部主任赫尔斯亦于十五日抵宁，积极执行文化侵略工作。美国务院官员十二月一日对蒋匪中央社记者表示，该协定基金可能用以协助“中（蒋）美学者”及“交换学生”研究“美国长期援华（蒋）方法”。美帝国主义通过此一协定以辅助其军事、经济、政治侵略之用心已完全暴露。
    在十月二十七日签订的美蒋“救济协定”中，美帝国主义者命令其走狗蒋介石“准许并安排充分与继续之宣传”，所有美国救济物资及由此制成之物品或容器上“应尽量于显著地位予以标记戳记烙印或贴签”，企图借此炫耀其假恩假惠。而作为美国文化侵略爪牙的卫理教传道会亦加强其活动，拟就在四年以四十五万七千美元扩充该会在华活动计划。
    为了妄图进一步将蒋管区人民的灵魂也出卖给美国主人，汉奸卖国贼蒋介石正仰承意旨以种种无耻行动贯彻美帝国主义侵略方针。十二月十五日，蒋匪教育部表示已向美国购买电教器材三十万美元，明年“社会教育”将以美化电影教育为中心，目前已在川、滇、湘、浙、赣、桂、闽、粤、豫甘、新疆、宁夏、辽北、京、沪、平各地成立电化教育辅导处，未成立者明年一律成立，并准备调训各省市电化工作人员，以便利美帝国主义使唤。
    十月二十四日蒋匪行政院通过充满独裁卖国臭味之蒋匪新“出版法”，新增了“外籍人民得依本法规定申请发行出版品”（第一章第八条）及“出版品不得为妨害本国或友邦元首名誉之记载”（第四章二十二条）两条，据外国通讯社事前透露，前者系应美国请求便利美国文化侵略而增加者，后者则显在企图禁止中美人民日益增长的反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的舆论。
