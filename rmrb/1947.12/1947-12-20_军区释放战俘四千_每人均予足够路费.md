    [This News Report] The Military Region announced: In the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and fifteenth months of the year, this region has released a total of three thousand nine hundred and ninety-two captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers in batches. All were given funds and sent out of the territory. Another one thousand one hundred and eighteen people, due to their voluntary requests, were approved to join the People's Liberation Army. Among the released officers were five generals: namely, Liu Guangxin, Major General and Brigade Commander of the 119th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army, Xie Maoquan, Brigade Commander of the 140th Brigade, Yang Xianming, Brigade Commander of the 104th Brigade, Wang Suiqing, Major General and Commander of the 6th Detachment of the Provisional 3rd Column, and Wang Shaozhen, Senior Advisor of the 3rd Column.

The rest were company-grade officers, including adjutants, staff members, political workers, and members of the so-called "People's Service Corps." Before their departure, banquets were held to bid them farewell, and they were escorted out of the liberated areas. Each person was given sufficient travel expenses, and those who were ill were provided with livestock or stretchers. The released officers were deeply moved and reluctant to part ways upon bidding farewell.
