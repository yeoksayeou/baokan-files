(Jinan Dispatch, Southern Hebei, 10th) The masses in Yongnian city live and work in peace and contentment, beginning to rebuild their homes. In the past, the city had a population of 30,000. After eight years of being ravaged by the Japanese invaders and two years of rule by the Chiang bandits, by the time of liberation, only 3,600 people remained due to death and escape. Many houses in the city were destroyed by the bandits. 1,129 civilian houses were torn down (including the four gates), 4,606 houses were destroyed by airplane bombs, and two streets were leveled to build an airport, totaling 15,563 houses destroyed. After liberation, with the relief from the democratic government, the masses who had fled to the surrounding countryside returned to the city one after another. By November 21st, the population of the city had increased to 7,300 people. The market is also gradually becoming prosperous, with the number of large and small vendors increasing to 413. Poor people returning from outside the city have spontaneously organized a Poor People's Association, confiscated the property of traitors, and are actively engaged in production. Wu Jinyuan, a family member of a revolutionary soldier in the North Street, received 153 catties of relief rice from the government for his family of five. He also borrowed several tens of thousands of dollars to set up a peanut stall. The women in the family spin and weave to earn money, earning 7,000 to 8,000 yuan a day. They are now able to eat polished rice, cornbread buns, and radish dishes. Old Mrs. Wu made dumplings on the day her son returned home. She said, "My Jingyun has been an administrator in the Eighth Route Army for six years and hasn't dared to come home. He came back to see me yesterday after liberation. Today we're making dumplings to improve our lives!" Lu Shasuo, a poor man in Beiguan, is dismantling the fortifications built by the Chiang bandits and bringing back the doors and bricks that were taken from him. He is rebuilding his house on a courtyard full of rubble and ruins. A doctor in South Street, after receiving a loan from the government, brought back a large quantity of traditional Chinese medicine from Handan and has already opened his practice.

    永年市民重建家务
    【本报冀南十日电】永年城内群众安居乐业，开始建立家务。该城过去拥有三万人口，经日寇蹂躏八年，蒋匪统治二年，到解放时，连死带逃，已只剩三千六百人。城内房屋被匪毁坏甚多，拆毁的民房有一一二九间（四关在内），飞机扔包砸毁房子四六○六间，建筑飞机场拆平两条街，共毁房一五五六三间。解放后，在民主政府救济下，逃亡四乡之群众纷纷回城。至十一月二十一日，城内人口已增至七千三百人。市面亦渐趋繁荣。大小商贩增到四一三家。由城外归来之贫民，自动串连组织了贫民会，没收了汉奸财产，积极生产。北街抗属武金元，一家五口，前后得政府发给救济米一五三斤，自己又贷了几万款，摆花生摊，家中女人纺织做买活，每天能收入七、八千元，已能吃到捞米干饭，棒子面窝窝头、萝卜菜。武老大娘在他儿子回家的那天，包起饺子，她说：“俺景云在八路军里当管理员，六年不敢进家了。解放后，昨天才回来看我。今天包饺子，改善生活哩！”北关贫民路沙锁，从蒋匪修的工事里拆回来自己被抢去的门板和砖，正在一片断垣废墟堆满瓦砾的场院上重新修盖自己的房子。南街某医生，得到政府贷款后，从邯郸拉来大部中药，已开张行医。
