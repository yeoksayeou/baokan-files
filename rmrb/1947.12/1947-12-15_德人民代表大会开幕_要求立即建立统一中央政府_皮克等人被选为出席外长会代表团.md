Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Berlin—The German People's Congress for Unity and a Just Peace in Germany opened here on the 6th. The congress lasted two days, with a total of 2,215 representatives attending, representing people from all walks of life and all parties in all occupied zones of the country, including 1,551 from the Soviet occupation zone and 664 from the Western occupation zones. Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party and one of the presidium members of the congress, pointed out in his opening speech that this congress would have a significant impact on Germany and the world. He then recounted the numerous difficulties encountered in the preparation of the congress, especially the difficulties and oppression suffered by the representatives from the western regions from the occupying authorities in those regions, resulting in most of them crossing the border "illegally." The congress then proceeded with the first item on the agenda: a report and debate on the German people's issue of a just peace and democratic unity. Representatives from all parties, democratic groups, and occupied zones unanimously demanded the immediate establishment of a central government, the conclusion of a democratic peace treaty, and the guarantee of Germany's political and economic unity in their passionate speeches. Representatives from the Western occupation zones also urged the Foreign Ministers' Conference to pay attention to the serious threat to Germany's democratic development due to the reactionary policies of the authorities in the Western occupation zones. The congress then proceeded with the second item on the agenda, the election of a delegation to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. A total of sixteen people were elected, including Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, and Crotti Woh, as well as representatives from the Communist Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, and other parties and democratic and religious groups in the Western occupation zones. Afterwards, the congress elected a standing committee of fifty members to be responsible for implementing the resolutions of the congress, and designated five of them to form a secretariat. The People's Congress finally passed an appeal to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which emphasized that the peace desired by the German people is a peace in accordance with the principles of the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions, so as to guarantee the free and democratic development of the German people and the complete restoration of sovereignty. The German people, in order to consolidate democratic forces and safeguard peace, sincerely request the elimination of war-mongers in their country. At the same time, they hope that the peace treaty can guarantee the economic and political unity of Germany, the establishment of a German central government including representatives of all democratic parties, and that this government should be allowed to participate in the peace conference and sign the peace treaty, and then elect a National Assembly by secret, universal, equal, and direct suffrage to ratify this peace treaty.
