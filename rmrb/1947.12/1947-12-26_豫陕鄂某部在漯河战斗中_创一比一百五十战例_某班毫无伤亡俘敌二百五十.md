Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 24th -- In the battle of Luohe on the Ping-Han Railway, fighters of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, due to their highly developed bravery and mobility, completely annihilated the defending enemy of 3,000 men with the same number of troops as the defenders, while we only suffered 20 casualties. The ratio of enemy to our casualties was one hundred and fifty to one. Many companies achieved amazing results in the battle. The 5th Company of a certain regiment, to which the famous combat hero Li Buzhou belongs, only had two platoons participating in the actual combat this time. In the battle, they captured more than 530 enemies without a single casualty. The results of the 3rd Squad of the 3rd Company of a certain battalion were even more astonishing. They captured more than 250 enemies without any casualties, exceeding their enemy annihilation plan by 25 times.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 24th -- In the newly liberated city of Luohe, more than 200 wounded soldiers abandoned by the Chiang bandits have received warm comfort and relief from the People's Liberation Army. They were all meaninglessly wounded in battles against the People's Liberation Army in Henan. In the Chiang bandit's 125th rear hospital in the city, 60 newly wounded soldiers were found without food or clothing, on the verge of death. Our medical personnel immediately gave them treatment, and the soldiers brought them food and cigarettes, comforting them. Those without clothing were immediately issued them. Wu Youchang, a wounded soldier of the Chiang bandit's 55th Division, was moved to tears. He said: I risked my life for old Chiang and ended up like this. If it weren't for you (referring to the People's Liberation Army), I would be finished. The remaining hundred or so wounded soldiers scattered in the city have also been taken in and given relief. Those whose injuries have not healed will continue to receive treatment, and those who wish to return home will be given travel expenses to send them back.

　　豫陕鄂某部在漯河战斗中
  　创一比一百五十战例
  　某班毫无伤亡俘敌二百五十
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十四日电】平汉路漯河战斗中，人民解放军某部战士由于发挥了高度的英勇和机动，以和守敌同等数目的兵力全部消灭守敌三千人，而我则仅伤亡二十人，敌我之伤亡比例为一百五十比一。许多连队在战斗中获得惊人战果。著名战斗英雄李步周所在之某团第五连，这次参加实际战斗的只有两个排，战斗中他们俘虏了敌人五百三十余名，而自己无一伤亡。又一营第三连第三班之战果更属惊人，他们毫无伤亡而俘虏敌人二百五十多名，超过他们歼敌立功计划中俘敌数目达二十五倍。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十四日电】新解放之漯河市内，被蒋匪遗弃之伤兵二百余人，已获得解放军温暖的安抚与救济。他们均系在河南与解放军作战中毫无意义的受伤者。在该市之蒋匪一二五后方医院中，发现之六十名新负伤者已衣食无着，奄奄待毙，我医务人员立即给予救护，战士们并为重伤号端饭递纸烟，安慰他们。无衣被者均立予发给，蒋匪五十五师的伤兵吴又常被感动得流泪，他说：我为老蒋卖命落得如此下场，要不是靠着你们（指解放军）就完了。其余流落该市之百余名伤兵，亦均获收容救济，伤未愈者继续予以治疗，愿回家者即给资遣送。
