Gaoyi's preliminary experience in organizing winter spinning is as follows:

1.  From collective spinning saving oil to mutual aid spinning saving labor. In calling for organization to carry out the 100-day spinning campaign, most village women were afraid of losing out in mutual aid spinning (due to differences in spinning quality and speed), found fixed shares troublesome, and feared losing freedom if organized. Based on the women's thoughts, the leadership first proposed: "Collective spinning saves oil," without emphasizing mutual aid spinning. In this way, spinning groups were established in most villages throughout the county, but most women still spun individually. After organizing to spin together, the women experienced that this was indeed good. For example, a woman from Li Chunying's group in Beijiao said: "Our twelve people often spin until midnight. If each person lights a lamp, it would take two catties of oil a night. If we weren't spinning together, we wouldn't last until twelve o'clock." After consolidating spinning together, it developed towards the path of collective spinning. Because each spun individually, every time they had to take their own thread to the market to sell, they would lose at least one day of work every five days. If spinning collectively, one person from a group could sell it at the market, saving a lot of labor. After the women had the demand for mutual aid spinning, the slogan "Mutual aid spinning saves labor" was immediately put forward. At this time, the women quickly responded. For example, after Sunjia Village called for this, more than a dozen women collectively bought cotton and collectively sold thread, and shared the profits based on the quantity and quality of spinning each day.

2.  Calculate specific accounts to boost spinning enthusiasm. At the beginning of spinning, some women looked down on spinning, and some were too lazy to do it, so specific accounts were calculated to clear up their thinking. For example, in Sunjia Village, when spinning was just starting, some women said they would spin at the meeting, but they didn't do it when they went down. At this time, everyone was asked to calculate accounts at the village women's federation meeting, and the women deeply realized their family's situation and that they had to work. At this time, the benefits of spinning were also used to clear up their thinking, and the spinning model Li Tian was praised (she spun two catties in five days, earning 1,200 yuan, which not only provided for the whole family to buy oil and salt, but also saved 900 yuan). Then, it was pointed out that the lazy woman ××× didn't spin, and didn't have money to buy oil and salt. As a result, everyone realized the importance of spinning, and also realized the shame of not spinning. The women said: "We must spin well in the future, spinning is both fame and fortune."

3.  Specific division of labor for women in the family. After the start of spinning, it was found that women had specific difficulties such as "can't sit still," "no time," and "can't finish the odd jobs" (especially women with children). In this case, Xiguan organized the division of labor in women's families. For example, the model military family Wang Luoru had three women in the family who didn't spin before. Later, the three members of the family specifically divided the work. His daughter-in-law, because she had two children, took on the odd jobs at home, and his wife and daughter focused on spinning, which solved the contradiction between family work and spinning.

4.  Summarize achievements and promote spinning. After spinning had been carried out for a month, some villages had made great achievements. For example, Sunjia Village earned 800,000 yuan in one month of spinning. Grasp the summary and conduct enlightenment. Everyone saw the actual benefits of spinning, and their enthusiasm became even greater. For example, at the summary meeting, women reflected: "We didn't spin well this month, and we still earned so much money." Everyone also mutually challenged each other and set plans, each person spinning six taels of thread and weaving two catties of cloth every day.

5.  Help women solve all difficulties. In this year's 100-day spinning campaign, the county leadership proposed that every cadre must effectively organize spinning, and more importantly, solve the specific difficulties in women's spinning. Cooperatives should provide more support. Villages such as Chengzhao, Beijiao, and Sunjia Village have done very well. The Chengzhao Cooperative knew that there were not enough spinning tools at the beginning of spinning, so it found carpenters to make fourteen spinning wheels and three looms, which were sold to women at one-quarter lower than the market price. In addition to making spinning wheels, the Sunjia Village Cooperative also made ten looms and lent them to spinning women. (Joint Office)

　　由集体纺省油到互助纺省工
    高邑组织冬纺经验
    【本报高邑讯】高邑在组织冬纺中有如下初步经验：一、由集体纺省油到互助纺省工。在号召组织起来开展百日纺织中，大部村庄妇女怕互助纺花吃亏（因有纺好纺劣，纺快纺慢），定分嫌麻烦，怕组织起来不自由等。根据妇女思想，领导上首先提出：“集体纺省油”，没有强调互助纺。这样全县大部村庄，都成立了纺织组，但大部分仍是各纺各的。在组织起来一块纺花后，妇女们体验到这样确是好。如北焦李春英组一个妇女说：“咱这十二人常是一纺半夜，如一人点一灯，用油一夜得二斤，要不是在一块纺，也顶不到十二点钟。”在一块纺巩固后，便向集体纺的道路发展。因各纺各的，每遇集自己拿上线到集上去卖，每五天顶少得误工一天。如集体纺，一集一个组有一个人就能卖了，即省了好多工。在妇女有了互助纺的要求后，即马上提出“互助纺省工”的口号。这时妇女很快便会响应。如孙家庄在这样号召后，即有十余个妇女集体买花集体卖线，每天按纺花的数量与质量进行订分。二、算具体帐鼓起纺织劲。在开始纺织时，有些妇女看不起纺织，有些人懒不想干，便算了具体帐，打通思想。如孙家庄在刚搞纺织时。有些妇女在开会时也说要纺，但下去即不干了，这时便在全村妇联会上，让大家算了帐，妇女们深刻认识了自己家当，不干不行。这时又拿上纺织的利益，打通思想，表扬了纺织模范李田（她在五天内纺二斤，赚了一千二百元，除供全家打油买盐外，还存了九百元）。接着又指出懒妇女×××不纺花，买油盐也没有钱。这样一来，大家认识了纺织重要，同时也认识了不纺花的耻辱，妇女们说：“咱以后可得好好纺哩，纺花是名利两得”。三、家中妇女具体分工。在开始纺织后，发现妇女存着“坐不下”“没工夫”“零碎活做不完”的具体困难（特别是有小孩的妇女）。在这样情况下，西关便组织了妇女家庭分工，如模范军属王洛儒家中有三个妇女，以前都不纺，后来家庭三人具体分了工，他儿媳因有两个小孩，抽出做家里零碎活，他女人、女儿单搞纺织，这样即解决了家庭活与纺织的矛盾。四、总结成绩，推动纺织。纺织开展了一个月，有些村做到了很大成绩，如孙家庄在一月纺织中赚了八十万元。抓住总结，进行启发，大家见到了纺织的实际利益，劲就更大了。如在总结会上妇女们反映说：“这一月还是没有好好纺，就赚了这样多的钱”，大家又互助挑了战，订了计划，每人每日纺线六两，织布的每天织布二斤。五、帮助妇女解决一切困难，今年的百日纺织运动中，县领导上提出每一个干部要确实组织纺织，更重要的是解决妇纺中的具体困难，合作社要多扶植。如城照、北焦、孙家庄等村都很好。城照合作社在一开始纺织，就知道纺织工具不够用，便找木匠制好纺车十四个，织机三张，低于市价四分之一卖给妇女。孙家庄合作社除制纺车外，并制成织机十张，也贷给了纺妇。（联合办公室）
