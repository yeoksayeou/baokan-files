　　Low Wages Make it Impossible to Survive
  　Year-End Labor Strikes Erupt in Beijing and Shanghai
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th】According to Tianjin newspapers, year-end labor strikes have begun in Beijing and Shanghai. Workers at the Nanjing Jiangnan Bus Company, after their demands for wage increases and year-end bonuses were rejected by the capitalists, launched a new type of struggle on the 13th of this month, described as "borrowing flowers to present to Buddha." On that day, the workers continued to operate the buses as usual, but did not sell tickets, allowing citizens to ride for free. By the afternoon, the capitalists were forced to yield and agreed to raise wages, and the workers achieved an initial victory. More than 500 workers in thirteen flashlight factories in Shanghai, unable to survive on their meager wages, began a strike on the day that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits issued 100,000-yuan banknotes. Furthermore, it is reported that over a hundred workers at the Tianjin Zhongnan Chemical Factory were subjected to armed suppression by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities at the end of last month for demanding increased wages and reduced working hours. When the factory workers broke through the obstacles and petitioned the Chiang Kai-shek Social Bureau again, a certain Yang, the Labor Section Chief of the bureau, adopted an arrogant and irrational attitude, which aroused the anger of the workers, who beat him severely. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities openly protected him and sent police to arrest thirteen workers. The situation is still developing. All the workers of the Tianjin branch of the Sanbei Shipping Company also submitted a request to the capitalists at the beginning of this month to improve their treatment and once considered a strike. Negotiations are still underway.

　　工资低微不能维持生活
  　京沪发生年关工潮
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据津报消息：京沪年关工潮开始发生。南京江南公共汽车公司职工因要求加薪及发给年终奖金遭资方拒绝后，已于本月十三日采取“采花献佛”之新型斗争方式进行斗争，该日职工仍照常工作驶车，但一律不售票让市民自由乘坐。延至下午资方被迫屈服，允予加薪，职工已获初步胜利。上海十三家电筒厂五百余工人，因工资低微无法生活，已于蒋匪发行十万元大钞之日起开始罢工。又讯：天津中南化学工厂工人百余人，上月底因要求增加工资、缩短工作时间遭蒋匪当局之武装镇压，当该厂工人冲破阻难，再度向蒋匪社会局请愿时，该局劳工科长杨某态度横蛮，毫无理性，遂引起工人忿怒，群起将其痛打，蒋匪当局公然包庇，派警察逮捕工人达十三名，现事态尚在发展中。三北轮船公司天津分公司全体工人亦于本月初向资方提出要求改善待遇，曾一度酝酿罢工，现尚在交涉中。
