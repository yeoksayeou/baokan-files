　　[This Dispatch from Jinnan, 25th] Hejia Village in the Fifth District of Qinghe wanted to establish a cooperative for winter production. After three or four days of preparation, 24 households invested more than 300,000 yuan. However, group discussions revealed that only middle peasants and a few poor peasants were speaking, while another group of poor peasants simply kept their heads down and remained silent. After further investigation, the poor peasant Yu Qingran said, "My family only has four mu of wheat land and four people. The harvest is not enough to feed us for even half a season. We rely on my three children begging for food. I sell basins to make a living." When asked if he had invested in the cooperative this time, he suddenly stood up, his face flushed, and tears in his eyes. He said, "I wanted to invest long ago, but I don't even have enough to eat! How can I invest?!" He added, "Because I don't have any money, I didn't dare to speak during the group discussions!" Village cadre Ren Decheng heard this and immediately held a self-criticism meeting for village cadres. They clarified that many poor peasants outside the cooperative were also afraid to speak up because they didn't have money, even though they wanted to invest. Subsequently, Yu Huiran said, "Because I don't have money to invest, I just sleep with my head covered and can't even eat! What can I say as the director myself?" Finally, it was decided to convene a meeting of the Peasants' Association to explain the situation, calling on those without money to boldly raise their difficulties, which would definitely be discussed and resolved. As a result, 16 poor peasants raised the difficulty of not having money to invest. After discussion by the members, it was decided to lend 700 jin of soybeans and bean cakes from the Peasants' Association to the poor peasants as capital for investment. Now, all 41 households in the village, except for the four who were landlord targets, have invested, totaling 670,000 yuan in shares. Everyone named the cooperative "Daqun Tongxin Cooperative" (Great Unity and Harmony Cooperative), and two oil mills, one of which has already started operating.

　　贫农翻身没翻透想入股拿不出钱
    【本报冀南二十五日电】清河五区荷家庄想成立合作社进行冬季生产，经过三四天的酝酿，就有二十四家入股三十多万元。但从小组讨论中，发现了只是中农和少数贫农发言，另一部分贫农光低着头，也不说话。经过深入了解，贫农于青然说：“我家只是四亩麦地，四口人，年年收的不够半季吃，都是指望着我这三个孩子要饭，我卖盆顾生活。”又问他这次在合作社里入股没有，他猛的站起来，红着脸，眼里流着泪说：“我早就愿意入股呀，吃的还没有哩！使什么入股呀？！”他又说：“为了我手里没钱，在小组讨论时就不敢说话！”村干任德成听到这些反映，当天便开了村干检讨会，弄清了社外边还有很多贫农因为没钱，有意入股也不敢说，随着，于惠然说：“我因为没钱入股，光睡闷头觉，也吃不下饭去！我想自己当着主任，能说啥？”最后，决定召集农会员大会，说明这个情况，号召没有钱的人大胆提出困难，一定讨论解决。结果就有十六名贫农提出没钱入股的困难，经会员讨论决定，将农会的豆子和表子七百斤，借给贫农当本入了股。现全村除四家被斗户外，四十一家都入了股，共计股金六十七万元，大家给社起了个名，叫“大群同心合作社”，两座油坊，有一个先干起来了。
