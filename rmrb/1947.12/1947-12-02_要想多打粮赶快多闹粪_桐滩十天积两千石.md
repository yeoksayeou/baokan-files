　　To Get More Grain, Quickly Make More Manure
  　Tongtan Accumulates Two Thousand Dan in Ten Days
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan News] The masses in Tongtan Town have come to realize the importance of accumulating fertilizer from comparing harvests. For example, Wang Yusuo of the Sixth Brigade planted two mu of millet on Sanlizhuang, with a yield of 2.4 shi per mu. In the spring, when everyone was busy preparing manure, he didn't have any manure at all. The village cadre advised him, "You don't have manure this year, go to the shop and buy some!" He said, "My land is good, I can still harvest grain without manure!" At planting, he only carried two loads of night soil to the field, and as a result, this autumn, the two mu only yielded two small shi of grain. Hao Yuzhu also planted two mu of millet, with a yield of only two shi per mu, but in the spring he applied 50 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer per mu and hoed it three times. This autumn, the two mu yielded six small shi. After this comparison, Yu Suo angrily said to everyone, "Alas! Not using manure this year was a big loss, I'll have to make more manure in the future." The masses also unanimously recognized that "to get more grain, you must use more manure." From the 10th to the 20th, the whole town accumulated a total of 2,045 dan of fertilizer, and Yu Suo alone accumulated 160 dan. The whole town also proposed the slogan "Guarantee 40 dan of manure per mu next year." (Fu Yuan, Yu Tian)

　　要想多打粮赶快多闹粪
  　桐滩十天积两千石
    【本报左权讯】桐滩镇群众从比收成中认识了积肥的重要，如六大队王玉锁种的三里庄二亩谷地，每亩产量二石四斗，春天人家都在忙着打整粪，他却一点粪也没有，村干部劝他说：“你今年没粪，去店房买点粪上吧！”他说：“我那是好地，不上粪也照样打粮食！”下种时，他只往地担了两担圊粪，结果今秋二亩地仅打了两小石谷。郝玉珠同样是种的二亩谷，每亩产量仅两石，春天每亩上了五十担杂粪，又锄了三遍，今秋二亩地就打了六小石。经这一对比后，气的玉锁见人就说：“唉！今年没上粪可吃了大亏啦，往后可要多闹粪哩。”群众也一致认识到“要想多打粮，就得多上粪。”全镇从十日到二十日十天内，共积肥二千零四十五担，仅玉锁一人即积肥一百六十担，全镇并提出“保证明年每亩上粪四十担”的行动口号。（福元、毓田）
