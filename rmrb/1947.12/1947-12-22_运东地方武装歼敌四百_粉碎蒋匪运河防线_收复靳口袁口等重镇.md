　　【Report from this newspaper in Jilu豫 on the 20th】 Our Yundong Local Corps launched an offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the Yundong area on the night of the 9th. After two days and nights of fighting, we recovered key strongholds along the Grand Canal, such as Jinkou, Yuankou, Kaihe, and Zhangdakou. We killed or wounded more than 150 men of the 141st Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd Division, captured more than 200 alive, and captured more than 80 local "Homecoming Legions". We seized 14 light machine guns, two 60 mortars, and more than 100 rifles and horses. On the morning of the 10th, another unit of ours annihilated a portion of the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd Division in Lizhuang on the east bank of the Grand Canal, capturing more than 70 alive and seizing 4 machine guns. After our local corps cleared the strongholds along the Grand Canal and thoroughly crushed the bandit "Grand Canal Joint Line", it launched an offensive against the puppet "Dongping Grand Detachment" of the 9th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek Shandong Security Brigade stationed in Dongping. The Dongping puppet bandits fled through the gap, and the city was once captured by us on the afternoon of the 13th.
