[Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 29th] The Anlan Conference, which grandly opened on November 20th, successfully concluded on December 21st after 32 days. This Anlan Conference was divided into two stages: the first stage mainly celebrated achievements and recognized model workers. On November 30th, the conference entered the second stage, summarizing the Yellow River management work of the past year. Each repair and defense department made typical reports on their Yellow River management work over the past year, such as the Stone Contribution of the Zhangqiudong Team, and the emergency rescue of Yunbei and Shounan. Starting from the 11th, discussions were held on future levee reconstruction, emergency rescue, flood prevention, organizational leadership for stone contributions, and other issues, proposing that Yellow River management next year should save labor and materials, strengthen leadership supervision and urging, coordinate with the rear's flood prevention organization, and improve work efficiency. The summary report concluded on the afternoon of the 21st, marking the complete and successful conclusion of the conference.

The Yellow River Work of the Past Year
　　Enemy Situation and Water Conditions
The Yellow River situation in the past year has been one of frequent battles. The three months prior were a period of frantic attacks by the Chiang bandits. The Chiang bandits advanced to Puyang, Fanxian, Guanxian, Daming and other places, marking a period of large-scale back-and-forth fighting between us and the enemy on both sides of the Yellow River. From April to early July, the enemy was forced to retreat, and we controlled Hebei, confronting the enemy across the river. From July to the Anlan Conference in November, we also controlled a section of the southern bank of Henan, while Qiyu and Changyuan on the northern bank were frequently harassed by the enemy. From the time the Chiang bandits released the Yellow River waters on March 15th until late July, we entered a major flood period. By the time of the first frost, there had been seven major floods, the second being the largest, estimated to have a flow rate of 15,000 cubic meters per second.
　　Work Overview:
In terms of the work process, the movement to build boats with jujube trees was launched along the river in mid-March, and work along the river began after April. The Second and Third Repair and Defense Departments carried out large-scale levee reconstruction before the wheat harvest, while the Fourth Repair and Defense Department carried out large-scale stone contribution and emergency rescue. After the wheat harvest, large-scale levee reconstruction was carried out across the board, and the stone contribution movement was also carried out in a timely manner. Flood prevention began in late July and continued until the first frost. During the flood prevention period and before the major floods, continuous emergency rescue efforts were carried out. Since the major floods, the breach at Shi Wangzhuang in Puyang County was urgently blocked. The Yellow River management work of the border region people in the past year has been very successful, achieving the complete heightening and thickening of the dikes along the Yellow River and repairing the Jin Dike, completing a huge project of 1.0X million cubic meters of earthwork. In terms of repairing dangerous sections, a large-scale stone contribution movement was carried out. The entire region completed 150,000 cubic meters of stone, concentrated 429,098,000 catties of straw, 1,652,720 catties of hemp, 1,652,920 piles, 5 million catties of willow branches, and 8,150 catties of lead wire, ensuring the repair of major dangerous projects. In terms of flood prevention, 5,000 people worked continuously for two and a half months. In terms of shipbuilding, 200 large ships were completed. In the past year, the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan contributed manpower and material resources, with the assistance of the people of Southern Hebei, Taiyue, and Taihang, to complete this great historical task. During the levee reconstruction alone, 300,000 people went to the dikes (not including repairing dangerous sections and flood prevention). Twenty-seven counties in the border region participated in the levee reconstruction, using 49,560 carts (not including carts for transporting piles and building ships). The regular expenses for levee reconstruction, repairing dangerous sections, and blocking breaches amounted to a huge sum of 3,181,934,950 JiluYu currency. The people along the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan contributed a huge amount of 220,700,000 catties of rice to the Yellow River effort. The damage suffered by the people along the river from the Chiang bandits and the Yellow River floods is not yet included. In the past year, the Party, government, army, and people have made the greatest efforts to manage the Yellow River, and our armed forces have protected the people repairing dikes and blocking breaches. In the past year, we have also gained more mature experience in Yellow River management. In levee reconstruction, we have achieved the coordination of manpower, tools, and technology, and have consistently maintained the high morale of the civilian laborers repairing the dikes, ensuring reasonable burdens, fair treatment, and scientific division of labor and organization. This year, the division of labor in villages and towns in Shouzhang, Zhangqiu, Fanxian and other counties was quite specific and scientific, giving full play to the talents of the masses. There have also been significant improvements in technology, such as ramming the earth faster and more solidly. From the perspective of repairing dangerous sections, huge projects have been completed in a very short time. The completion of this project has played a significant role, especially the success in experimenting with willow-stone dams. For example, a 5,000-cubic-meter stone dam can save 25 million yuan (equivalent to half the dam) if it is replaced with a willow-stone dam. Most of the dangerous sections and large dams have been repaired in the past year. Flood prevention is extremely important work on the river, because dangerous sections are guarded by special personnel, and most of the breaches occur from leaks. This year's flood prevention was done spontaneously by the masses, and the organization and tools were relatively complete. Puyang County did particularly well in flood prevention, with timely enlightenment and education, and frequent inspection of organization and leadership. In the past year, Shouzhang, Zhangqiu, and Fanxian counties did a very good job in organizing and leading Yellow River management. They had mobile blackboard newspapers during levee reconstruction and Yellow River management. When the enemy situation was most tense on the southern bank of the Yellow River, the Yunbei and Kunshan engineering teams continued to work, with cadres leading the masses to carry out emergency rescue and dike repair. Although we have achieved victory in Yellow River management this year, as it is the first time, there are still many shortcomings in the work, with no strict organization, detailed plans, and calculations, which has led to the work being left to its own devices. In flood prevention, 280-foot flood prevention sheds were uniformly adopted, wasting a lot of manpower and becoming a formality.
　　Future Guidelines
The future Yellow River management work will still adhere to the policy of "Ensuring the safety of the dikes along the Yellow River, and not allowing any breaches"; First, we must effectively consolidate the dikes, heighten and thicken the dikes along the Yellow River, and repair the Jin Dike. Second, in terms of dangerous sections, we should strive to complete the stone contribution and straw collection as soon as possible. Third, we must abolish people's dikes and improve branch rivers and drainage ditches to ensure the safety of the dikes along the Yellow River.

　　安澜大会胜利闭幕
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】于十一月二十日隆重揭幕之安澜大会，历时三十二天，已于十二月二十一日胜利闭幕。按此届安澜大会共分两个阶段；第一阶段主要庆功表模。十一月三十日大会即进入第二阶段，总结一年来的治黄工作，由各修防处段做一年来治黄的典型汇报，如张秋东队的献石，郓北与寿南的抢险等。从十一日开始，讨论今后复堤、抢险、防泛、组织领导献石等问题，并提出明年治黄要节约工料、加强领导上的检查督促、与后方的防泛组织、提高工作效率等治河精神。总结报告于二十一日下午结束，大会至此则圆满胜利闭幕。
    一年来的治河工作
  　敌情与水情
    一年来的黄河形势，是处于频繁的战斗中。三月前是蒋匪疯狂进攻的时期，蒋匪曾进到濮、范、观、大名等地，这是敌我在黄河南北的大拉锯时期。四月至七月初，敌人被迫后退，我们控制了河北，和敌人隔河对峙。从七月至十一月的安澜大会止，我们并控制了河南岸的一段，而北岸的齐禹和长垣，经常在敌侵扰中。从三月十五日蒋匪放下黄水后，至七月下旬，进入大泛期；至霜降，共来大水七次，以第二次为最大，据估计，有一万五千秒的立方流量。
　　工作概况：
    在工作的进程上，自三月中旬沿河发起枣树造船运动，四月后展开了沿河工作。麦前二、三修防处进行了大复堤，四修防处进行了大规模的献石抢险，麦后即全线大复堤，献石运动亦及时进行。七月下旬防泛开始，直到霜降结束，在防泛期间与大泛前，不断的进行抢险。大泛以来，濮县史王庄抢堵了漏洞。八月下旬蒋匪在贯台扒口。一年来边区人民的治河是有很大成绩的，做到临黄堤全部加高与增厚，并修补金堤，完成了一千零×万方土的巨大工程。在整险方面，进行了大规模的献石运动。全区完成了十五万方石，集中了四二九○九八○○斤秸料，一六五二七二○斤麻，一六五二九二根桩，五百万斤柳枝，八一五○斤铅丝，保证了巨大险工的整理。在防泛方面，每日有五千人持续了两个半月的时间。在造船工作上，完成了二百只大船。一年来冀鲁豫人民贡献了人力与物力，并有冀南、太岳、太行人民的协助，来完成了这一伟大的历史任务。仅在复堤时，就有三十万人民上堤（整险和防泛尚不在内），只边区参加复堤者，即有二十七个县，用大车达到四九五六○辆（运桩造船的车尚不在内），只复堤整险堵口经常费用，共用冀钞三、一八一、九三四、九五○元之巨。冀鲁豫沿河人民，则以二二○七○○○○斤米之巨额，贡献在黄河上。至于沿河人民受蒋匪与黄水之损害，尚未在内。一年来党政军民用最大的努力，来治理了黄河，我们的武装掩护了修堤及抢险堵口的人民。一年来在治河方面，亦获得了较成熟的经验。在复堤上，已取得人力工具及技术的配合，经常保持了民工修堤情绪的旺盛与饱满，得到了负担合理及公平待遇和科学的分工与组织。今年寿张、张秋、范县等县村庄，分工相当具体而科学，发挥了群众的天才，在技术上，并有显著提高，如硪工打得又快又结实。在整险方面来看，在很短的时间内，完成巨大的工程。由于这一工程的完成，起了很大的作用。特别是在试验柳石坝的成功。如一个五千方的石坝，改用柳石坝，即可节约两千五百万元（相等于全坝之一半）。各处险工大坝在今年一年内已大部修好。防泛在河上是极其重要的工作，因险工有专人防守，决口处多数是从漏洞里。今年防泛是群众自动的，组织及工具都比较完善。在防泛上，濮县作的特别好，及时的启发与教育，并经常检查组织与领导。一年来治河中在组织领导方面，寿张、张秋、范县作的很好，他们在复堤治河中有流动的小黑板报。黄河南在敌情最紧张的时候，郓北、昆山工程队还坚持工作，干部率领群众抢险修堤。由于今年是初次治河，虽然在治河中取得了胜利，但是工作上还存在着很多缺点，没有严密的组织，周详的计划和计算，因之使工作放任自流。在防泛上，一律采取了二百八十尺一个防泛棚，浪费了不少的人力，流为形式主义。
　　今后的方针
    今后的治河工作，仍是“确保临黄，不准开口”的方针；一、切实巩固堤坝，加高培厚临黄堤，补修金堤。二、在险工方面，争取献石和集中秸料早日完成。三、废除民坝，整理支河串沟，以保临黄堤的安全。
