Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th – The 40,000 military personnel and civilians in the Sanyu District of Nantong, the nation's second-largest cotton-producing region, are engaged in a fierce anti-cotton-grabbing struggle against the Chiang-Song clique. After the new cotton came onto the market, Song Ziwen's Shanghai China Cotton Yarn Factory colluded with local landlords and despots in Sanyu Town to form a large-scale plunder organization called the "Haibin Office," which, in conjunction with local bandits and puppet forces, frantically seized cotton. On November 4th, Zeng Houze, deputy brigade commander of the bandit 146th Brigade, commanded more than 2,000 bandits and puppet troops to build eight more strongholds in the area, stationing troops to blockade the seaports and carry out plunder. They forcibly levied 450 jin of rent cotton per *mu* (25 acres) and 2.5 million jin of cotton as self-defense funds per *fang* (6.25 square li). According to incomplete statistics from Haiyan, Gong'an, and other three townships alone, more than 3,000 dan of cotton have been seized so far, and the cotton harvested by farmers in Fengdong Village has been completely looted. In order to resist this atrocity, the local military and civilians have launched a full-scale cotton protection struggle, implementing a scorched-earth policy. Under the leadership of township cadres, "running-away stations" were established, with village cadres, militia, and activists forming the core to control the masses, camping in groups, and moving flexibly to transport cotton across the blockade line. Mass prevention of spies and special agents is being carried out, and feudal landlords are strictly managed. The day after the enemy occupied Datong Town, more than 400 people from Tongbei Township publicly tried and executed three local bullies, and took away most of the bandit family members and despotic landlords in the entire district. The masses posted slogans everywhere, warning the Chiang bandits who were grabbing cotton. At the same time, the district and township armed forces launched an internal line enemy-killing campaign, killing more than 140 enemies in ten days, supporting the cotton farmers' struggle. When the district was occupied by the Chiang bandits in October last year, the cotton farmers rose up to launch a cotton protection struggle, repeatedly defeating the enemy. Five successive bandit puppet district chiefs were either killed or fled. However, the cotton farmers' losses also reached tens of thousands of dan. This spring, the People's Liberation Army recovered the area and controlled the vast countryside, and had smashed the second cotton grab organized by the Chiang bandits in early September. The third anti-cotton grab struggle is now underway.
