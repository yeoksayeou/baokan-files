　　Xingtai City Goods Stations in the Second Taihang District
　　Establish Transportation Liaison Council to Facilitate Disaster Victims Bringing Back Goods
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to help disaster victims in the Second Taihang District transport goods back, a meeting of goods stations and shops in Xingtai City belonging to the joint cooperatives of Zuoquan, Yushe, Heshun, and Xiyang counties was held in Xingtai City on the 18th of this month. A transportation liaison committee was established to solve the transportation difficulties of disaster victims in a unified manner. In the past, each county almost independently tried to find ways to transport goods back. For example, the Xiyang County Joint Cooperative had a cadre specifically stationed in Xingtai to run shops, inquire about market prices for the masses, and find ways to transport goods back. Since November, they have found ways to transport back approximately 160,000 jin of goods, including edible salt, flour, mung beans, and scallions. About 1,600 mules have transported goods back. In three months, Quanxing Goods Station helped the masses in Zuoquan sell 146,315 jin of mountain products, and the masses earned 7.4 million yuan in transportation fees. Most of the livestock that delivered mountain products also transported goods back, earning transportation fees of up to 6.45 million yuan. Approximately 900 animals came down from Heshun. The county cooperative's goods station in Xingtai helped find 110,000 jin of goods to transport back (mostly edible salt and cloth), which could earn approximately 3.85 million yuan in transportation fees. Despite these achievements, due to each unit acting independently without communication, sometimes livestock could not find goods to transport back and returned empty. In addition, some households could not find transportation and hired it at high prices locally.
    After the establishment of the liaison council, the following methods were studied: (1) Organize a coal market in the city's prosperous area. If the masses cannot sell, Wanji Coal Station will purchase it to solve the difficulties of the masses. (2) Regularly study the situation; the Transportation Liaison Committee decided to hold a meeting every ten days, combining it with the unit's business and dividing the labor to purchase goods for transportation back. Everyone believes that at present, mountain products are滞滞滞 [probably "stagnant" or "delayed"], and iron goods are congested. Edible salt is the item that can be transported in larger quantities. (3) Since the quantity of goods for transportation back is difficult to meet the needs of the masses (Ping, Xi, He, Zuo, and Yu can currently have 200 to 300 animals coming every day. It will increase in the future), these limited goods for transportation back should first take care of the poor who are hired, and should not neglect to help them because their livestock are weak. It is also suggested that the municipal government and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce call on all shops in the city to prioritize the transportation by disaster victims in the Second District when shipping goods to Shanxi at the same transportation cost. Returning transportation is usually cheaper than hiring someone specifically, which is also beneficial to the market and shops.

　　太行二分区邢市各货栈
  　成立运输联络会便利灾民捎回脚
    【本报讯】太行二分区为给灾民运输找回脚，本月十八日在邢台市召开了左权、榆社、和顺、昔阳等县县联社住邢台之货栈、店房会议，成立了运输连络委员会，统一解决灾民运输困难。过去各县差不多都单独设法找回脚，如昔阳县联社是专有干部一人，在邢台搞店房，代群众打问行市，寻找回脚，自十一月份以来，经他们找到的回脚，有食盐、白面、绿豆、葱等约十六万多斤，约有一六○○头毛驴捎了回货。权兴货栈三个月，代左权群众推销山货一四六三一五斤，群众赚脚力洋七四○万元，送下山货之牲口，大都捎上了回脚，赚脚价亦达六四五万元。和顺下来之牲口约计九百头，县社在邢市之货栈，代找下回货（食盐、布匹最多）十一万斤，约可赚脚力洋三八五万元。虽有这些成绩，但由于各顾各，互不联系，有时有牲口找不下回货而空回去的；另外还有找不下脚户，而从当地高价急雇者。
    联络会成立后，研究做法是：（一）在本市繁华处组织煤市，群众卖不了时，由万记煤栈购买，解决群众的困难。（二）定期研究情况；运输连络委员会决议为十天召开一次，结合本单位业务，分工购买回货。大家认为目前山货迟滞，铁货拥塞，可以转运较大数量的是食盐。（三）由于回货数量难以满足群众要求（平、昔、和、左、榆目前每天可以来二百到三百牲口。以后还会增加），这有限的回货也应首先照顾雇贫，不因他们牲口软弱而忽视帮助。并建议市政府、工商局，号召市内各商店，往山西发货时，在同样脚费下，最好尽二分区灾民先运。回脚通常比专雇便宜，对市场和商店也都有好处。
