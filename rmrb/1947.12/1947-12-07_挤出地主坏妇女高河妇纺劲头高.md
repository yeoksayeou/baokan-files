　　[From our Changzhi correspondent] After resolving the issue of winter idleness among women in Gaohe Village, Second District, and establishing an equivalent distribution of profits plan, most of the women in the village began spinning and weaving. During the process, four groups showed little enthusiasm. After discussion and research, it was found that the lack of enthusiasm was due to sabotage by landlord women. Women's group leader Guo Shunjie said, "The target of struggle, Yuan Chaoze, during the autumn spinning and weaving, his daughter-in-law incited Zhang Yichang's wife and five other women to go up the mountain to pick wild jujubes instead of spinning and weaving. If these bad eggs are not cleaned out, they will spoil the other good women." Woman Li Yindi said, "Rich peasant Dong Fanhai spread rumors at the meal market, saying: Women's spinning and weaving is a waste of time, how can you spin with children?" After discussion, a village-wide women's meeting was held, and Yuan Chaoze, Li Zhaoren's wife, and two others were squeezed out. Since squeezing out the bad eggs, the enthusiasm of the women in each group for spinning and weaving has increased even more. A monthly spinning and weaving plan was re-established, and women in each street challenged each other at the meeting. Now, the women in each group have taken action, and the cotton gins cannot keep up with the demand. (Yongping)
    [From our Changzhi correspondent] On the 26th of last month, the Fifth District convened a joint meeting of women cadres from various villages, poor and hired peasant activists, and village cooperative presidents and managers, totaling more than 200 people, to discuss spinning and weaving work. After a day and a half of meetings, it was finally clarified who to mobilize and who to rely on in spinning and weaving? It was determined to take poor and hired women as the backbone, unite with middle peasants, and manage landlords. The slogans "If you want to do a good job in spinning and weaving, poor and hired women should take the lead" and "Cooperatives provide loans to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired" were put forward. Finally, each of the four base points in the district, village by village, set a one-month spinning and weaving plan, and the whole district will spin and weave a total of more than 9,560 zhang of cloth within one month. (Shouchuang, Pangze, Shude)
    [From our Zuoquan correspondent] Each mutual aid team in Tongtan Town has successively held meetings to review the spinning and weaving achievements of the past year. The whole town has woven a total of 3,419 zhang of cloth, averaging two jin of cloth per person, and 24 technicians have been trained (excluding landlords and feudal elements), 92 women have learned to spin cotton (excluding those who learned last year), and 57 women have learned to weave. Most of the masses attach great importance to spinning and weaving. During the review, the masses proposed: "Landlord women cannot be our technicians." Liu Xiaochang, the leader of the joint team, said: "Our joint team hired the daughter-in-law of landlord Chen Shuangcheng as a technician this year. She went to visit relatives every other day, and she didn't care when the spinners were tying threads, and two machines were broken in a row." Spinning hero Zhang Hexiang said: "Our village has 31 weaving machines, all of which are native machines, which weave slowly and the cloth is not good." After review, Township Head Wang grasped the demands of the masses, pointing out that the whole town should achieve "every family spins cotton and every group organizes cloth" in winter, and a poor and hired peasant spinning training institute should be attached to the peasant cooperative, specializing in training poor and hired women to learn to weave on foreign machines. The cooperative president has now earned back two foreign machines from outside. (Fuyuan, Yutian)

　　挤出地主坏妇女高河妇纺劲头高
    【本报长治讯】二区高河村，解决了妇女冬闲思想，订出等价分红计划后，全村大部分妇女开始了纺织。进行中有四个组劲头不大，经大家讨论研究，不起劲的原因，有地主妇女破坏，妇女组长郭顺姐说：“斗争对象原朝则，秋天纺织时，他媳妇挑拨张义昌妻等五个妇女，叫上山去打酸枣，不叫纺织，有这些坏蛋不清洗，把其他好妇女都挑拨坏了。”妇女李引弟说：“富农董反孩，在饭市上造谣说：妇女纺织都是瞎误工哩，有孩子还能纺线？”讨论后，就召开了全村妇女大会，共挤出原朝则、李招仁妻等四人。自挤出坏蛋以后，各组妇女纺织情绪更大，重新订出了一月的纺织计划，各街妇女在大会挑战，现各组的妇女都行动起来，忙的弹花机都赶不上需要。（永平）
    【本报长治讯】上月二十六号，五区召开了各村妇女干部、贫雇积极妇女、和村联社社长经理二百余人的联席会，讨论纺织工作。开了一天半，最后明确了纺织中发动什么人，依靠什么人？确定以贫雇妇女为骨干，团结中农，管理地主。提出：“纺织工作要搞好，贫苦妇女带头搞”，“合作社放贷款，为贫雇解困难”等口号。最后全区四个基点，村村订出一个月纺织计划，全区连纺带织，一月内共要成九千五百六十余丈布。（守创、胖则、树德）
    【本报左权讯】桐滩镇各互助大队，先后召开会议，检查一年来纺织成绩。全镇共织布三四一九丈，平均每人达到二斤布，培养出技师二十四名（地主封建不在内），九十二个妇女学会了纺花（去年学会不在内），五十七名妇女学会了织布，大部群众对纺织都很重视。在检讨中群众提出：“地主家妇女可不能给咱当技师啦”，联合队队长刘小昌说：“俺联合队今年用了地主陈双成的媳妇当技师，三天两日去走亲戚，纺员们拴线时他也不管，一连就坏了两机。”纺织英雄张荷香说：“咱村三十一架织布机就都是土机，织的又慢布又不好。”经过检讨，王镇长抓着了群众要求，指出全镇冬季要作到“家家纺花组组织布”，并在农民合作社附设一贫雇纺织训练所，专门培养贫雇妇女学织洋机，现合作社长已从外面赚回两架洋机。（福元、毓田）
