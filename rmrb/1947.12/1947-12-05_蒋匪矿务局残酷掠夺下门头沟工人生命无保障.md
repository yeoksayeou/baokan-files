Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to the Tianjin Dagong and Yishi newspapers of the 9th of last month, regarding the miserable lives of workers in the Mentougou coal mine in western Hebei: worker welfare has never been a concern of the company. The majority of workers are contracted, and the foreman exploitation system still exists seriously. Single men live in "contractor's bunks" (commonly known as "guohuo"), a large bunk where seventy-five people take turns sleeping day and night. Cooking is also done indoors. Each worker's daily income is only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan; coupled with the foreman's exploitation, it is difficult for one person to even afford a窝窝头 (wō wō tóu, a type of cornbread), let alone take care of their families. Many child laborers are only eleven or twelve years old and are already working underground carrying coal, which greatly affects their health. According to one worker: "The East Well is 600 feet deep, and the West Well is 900 feet deep; it is extremely painful down below." The safety equipment in the mine is rudimentary, and almost every day workers are crushed to death or injured. The hospital always has about one hundred people seeking surgical treatment and thirty or forty people seeking internal medicine treatment. As for the cultural life of the workers, it is out of the question. There is only one mine-run elementary school in the mining area, with less than two hundred students, and most of them are the children of senior staff. Furthermore, at the Zhao Ge Zhuang Coal Mine of the Chiang Kai-shek's Kailuan Mining Bureau, at the No. 9 trough and No. 8 working face of the sixth section, due to the Chiang Kai-shek mining authorities disregarding employee safety measures, a gas explosion occurred on the 15th of this month, killing nineteen workers.

　　蒋匪矿务局残酷掠夺下门头沟工人生命无保障
    【新华社陕北三日电】据天津大公、益世报上月九日载平西门头沟煤矿工人生活惨苦情形称：工人福利素不为公司方面所注意。工人中包工占大多数，工头剥削制度仍严重存在。单身汉所住之“包工炕”（俗称“锅火”），一个大炕，有七十五个人日夜上班轮流睡觉。屋内尚须生灶做饭。工人每人每日收入仅有两三万元；再加以工头剥削，即一人吃窝窝头亦甚勉强，更难顾及家眷，有不少童工年仅十一、二岁，即已下矿背煤，致影响健康甚大。据一工人称：“东井矿深六百英尺，西井深九百英尺，在底下痛苦极了。”矿井安全设备简陋，几乎每天都有工人被压死或受伤者，医院里每日总有一百人左右看外科；三、四十个人看内科，至于工人文化生活更谈不到，矿区内仅有矿立小学一所，不足二百人，且多为高级职员子弟。又蒋匪开滦矿务局赵各庄煤矿六道行第九槽第八眼采煤地点，由于蒋匪矿务当局蔑视员工安全措施，致本月十五日突发生煤气爆炸事件，炸死工人十九人。
