    Jize Fourth District Determined to Use Key Points to Promote General
    Grasp Leadership of Winter Production
    [Report from This Newspaper, Ji'nan, 9th] The Jize Fourth District began to shift to sideline occupations, and the leadership grasped it very tightly from the beginning. The district held three village cadre conferences with more than 400 people each time to arrange, discuss, and solve how to carry out winter production and what benefits it would bring. It was also decided to select a key point village from the area, where cadres would concentrate leadership, create experience, and promote the general. Taking area villages as a unit, the main village cadres held a meeting every five days to report on work and exchange experience. A meeting of all village cadres was held every ten days to summarize achievements, practices, and good and bad points, with praise and criticism given on the spot. During the winter plowing period, the district carried out calculations of harvest in various villages, breaking through the masses' thinking and making them understand that this year's harvest was not good and that sideline occupations and mutual aid should be used to make up for the shortage of food. Li Qingyun of Xiaowan Village said: "This year's harvest is not good, doing business is better than resting. If what you earn is enough to eat, you can save the food at home." All villages have planned not to eat food from their homes for two months. The masses have a high enthusiasm for production. In Xikongbao Village, out of 110 laborers, 63 men are now engaged in sideline occupations. The women in each village have also set textile plans. For example, the women in Xikongbao Village plan to weave three bolts of cloth per person by the end of the year and have challenged the farmers' association. According to an incomplete statistic of various sideline occupations in twelve villages including Lima Chang, Kongbao, and Sunbaoying, there are 11 flour mills, 13 cotton mills, 6 oil mills, 13 noodle mills, 7 restaurants, 4 steamed bun shops, and 3 lumber yards; 10 people making pot lids together, 2 carpenters working outside, 16 various peddlers, 11 transport carts, 76 transport wheelbarrows, and 76 people leaching saltpeter. In addition to pushing wheelbarrows to sell vegetables and fruits, most of the sideline occupations in each village are done through mutual aid. For example, the mutual aid groups of Li Qingyun and Xiao Jianyun in Xiaowan Village, with a total of nine households, have merged into a mutual aid group combining agriculture and sideline occupations, operating a steamed bun shop and a noodle shop. Now men, women, old and young in each village are working hard to avoid eating food from their homes for the next two months.

    鸡泽四区决以基点推动一般
    抓紧领导冬季生产
    【本报冀南九日电】鸡泽四区一开始转副业，领导上就抓的很紧。该区曾召开三次四百人以上的村干大会，布置、讨论、解决了冬季生产怎样进行及有啥好处等问题。并决定在片村中择一基点村，干部集中领导，创造经验，推动一般。以片村为单位，五天开一次村主要干部碰头会，汇报工作，交流经验。十天开一次全体村干会议，总结成绩、作法及好坏，当场表扬与批评。该区在冬耕期中，各村即进行了计算收成，打通群众思想，使群众都了解今年的收成不好，要以副业互助补足缺粮。萧湾村李庆云说：“今年收成不好，干个买卖就比歇着强。赚的顾住吃了，就省出家里饭。”各村都计划两个月不吃家里粮。群众生产劲头很高。西孔堡村一百一十个劳力，现就有六十三个男人大搞副业。各村的妇女亦都订出了纺织计划。如西孔堡村妇女，计划到年底每人要纺织出三匹布，并给农会挑了战。据李马昌、孔堡、孙堡营等十二个村各样副业的不完全统计，计有磨粉坊十一座，花坊十三座，油坊六座，挂面坊十三座，饭铺七处，馒头坊四座，木料厂三处；合做锅盖者十人，出外当木匠者二人，各种小贩十六人，运输大车十一辆，运输小车七十六辆，淋硝盐者七十六人。各村的副业除推小车卖菜卖果子外，大部分是互助伙干的。如萧湾村李庆云、萧健云两个互助组，共九户，合并了一个农副业结合的互助组，经营馒头坊、挂面坊。现各村的男女老少都在为目前两个月不吃囤里粮而努力。
