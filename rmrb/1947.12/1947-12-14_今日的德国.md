Today's Germany

Before the war, Germany was a militaristic and feudal fascist state. A very small number of big capitalists and 5% of the Junker families and big landlords ruled over the approximately 70 million German people, while more than 63% of the working class and peasants groaned under the Nazi regime they jointly formed.

In the capitalist world, Germany's industrial production ranked second before the war, accounting for 12% of the world's total production. Annual steel production was 25 million tons, ranking second in the world; coal production was over 260 million tons, ranking third; electricity was second only to the United States; the chemical industry supplied a quarter of the world; shipbuilding at its peak also ranked second in the world; water and land transportation was the best in Europe; and commercial turnover was second only to the United States and Britain. Half of Europe's industrial coal supply depended on the Ruhr. Even before the war, American imperialism had inextricable economic ties with Nazi Germany. American monopoly capitalists controlled 278 German companies, Wall Street's direct investment in Germany exceeded $1 billion, 90 American companies had close relations with Germany's largest chemical trust, Farben, New York Telephone almost owned all the capital of 20 German electrical companies, and General Electric, Mobil, Ford, and others were inextricably linked with German monopoly capitalists. After Nazi Germany surrendered in May 1945, its 470,000 square kilometers of territory, except for the area east of the Oder and Neisse rivers which was returned to Poland, was divided by the Allied powers into four occupation zones: Soviet, American, British, and French, and an Allied Control Council was organized to coordinate the administration of each zone. The German capital, Berlin, was jointly administered by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The Soviet occupation zone was in eastern Germany, with a population of 24 million, cultivated land accounting for 37% of the total in Germany, and industrial and mining production accounting for 35% of the total in Germany. The American occupation zone was in the south, the British occupation zone was in the northwest, and the French occupation zone was in the southwest. The American, British, and French occupation zones are generally referred to as the Western occupation zones. The population of the three occupation zones totaled 47.5 million, cultivated land accounted for 63% of the total in Germany, and industrial and mining production accounted for 65% of the total in Germany. The German arms factories in the Soviet occupation zone accounted for 20% of the total in Germany, and the Soviet occupying army numbered 300,000 to 350,000; the German arms factories in the American occupation zone accounted for 17% of the total in Germany, and the American occupying army numbered 400,000 (or 130,000 according to one source); the arms factories in the British occupation zone accounted for 54% of the total in Germany, and the British occupying army numbered 200,000; the arms factories in the French occupation zone accounted for 9% of the total, and the occupying army numbered about 100,000. The Ruhr in the British occupation zone is the heart of German industry and the breeding ground for militarism and fascism. It concentrates 60% of Germany's heavy industry, coal production accounts for 70% of pre-war Germany's total, and steel production accounts for two-thirds of Germany's total.

The facts of the past two and a half years show that the eastern and western occupation zones are being administered under two extremely opposite lines.

The Soviet occupation zone in the east faithfully implemented the Yalta Agreement of February 1945 and the Potsdam Agreement of August of the same year, and quickly eliminated the Nazis, eradicated militarism, and built a new democratic life for the German people in all aspects from economic and political to military. All war factories, military equipment, and Nazi armed forces were completely dismantled shortly after the occupation. Land reform began in the autumn of 1945 and was quickly completed. More than 7,000 large landowners and Junker families with more than 100 hectares of land were liquidated, their houses, estates, farm implements, forests, and livestock farms were confiscated, and 2,152,000 hectares of land and a large number of livestock and farm implements were distributed to the peasants. These included 157,823 landless peasants and agricultural workers, 59,200 poor peasants, and 64,130 immigrants. Trusts, cartels, and large banks were nationalized, and workers had full control. All war criminals and Nazi property were confiscated, and the production of peaceful industries last year recovered to 70% of the level stipulated by the Allied Control Council. The Soviet policy of controlling Germany not only guarantees that the German people can be completely liberated from the fascist reactionary forces, but also guarantees that Germany can embark on the road of economic recovery and development into a democratic and peace-loving country, which is conducive to European and world peace.

All anti-fascist parties in the Soviet occupation zone, such as the Socialist Unity Party (formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in April last year) which formed the anti-fascist front, the Christian Democratic Union, and the Free Democratic Party, were able to operate freely. The people gained true democratic rights. In the local elections held in September last year, more than 90% of the voters participated, and they elected more than 70,000 German democratic citizens to participate in the administrative work of 146 cities and more than 2,000 rural areas. As a result, the democratic forces in the Soviet occupation zone have greatly increased, and the number of members of the Socialist Unity Party has increased to 1.9 million. Of the 6.5 million members of the All-German Trade Union Federation, 4 million are here. The Farmers' Mutual Aid Association has 500,000 members, and the "Free German Youth" and the "Cultural Alliance" of progressive intellectuals also have huge forces. The leader of the German Communist Party, Pieck, has gained wide prestige among the people.

The control of the American, British, and French in the western occupation zones completely violated the Potsdam and Yalta Agreements. They feared a unified and democratic Germany and attempted to use the part of Germany they occupied as a military and military-industrial base and a stronghold for European reactionary forces, so as to facilitate their future war adventures and to oppose the democratic forces in Germany and other European countries. Therefore, they tried their best to protect the fascists, retain the Nazi armed forces and war industries, and suppress the democratic movement. At the end of last year, the commander of the American occupation forces pardoned 800,000 petty Nazis, and a large number of Nazi personnel still held important positions in the economic and administrative departments of the American, British, and French occupation zones. American officers are training "pioneer" military groups composed of thousands of German youths, and forcing German youths to continue military training. Britain renamed 70,000 German troops as "labor teams," and hired 70,000 former Polish government-in-exile troops as guards, and allowed more than 12,000 so-called "Royal Yugoslav Army" troops to be stationed in the Munster area. France recruited more than 50,000 German officers and soldiers to massacre the Vietnamese people and suppress other colonial peoples. In the American occupation zone, there are at least 120 arms production factories, but it was only decided to dismantle 52; in the British occupation zone, there are at least 284, but it was only decided to dismantle 139, and they are dragging their feet in the implementation of the dismantling. Important German naval and air bases, such as the port of Kiel, are still preserved. The Konzerns, cartels, and trusts of German monopoly capital remain untouched. Land reform has not been implemented at all. The peaceful industrial production volume stipulated by the Allied Control Council is actually maintained at a very low level. Therefore, the German people are still trapped in hunger and extreme poverty.

At the same time, democratic parties are prohibited from having unified organizations throughout Germany, and the activities of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party are suppressed and prohibited from merging. However, anti-democratic Lower Saxony Farmers' Party, Radical Liberal Party, and New Rhine Party have sprung up like mushrooms in the American, British, and French occupation zones.

Right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, such as Schumacher, are also used as tools against the people.

Even so, the German people in the western occupation zones are still fighting heroically, and the democratic forces are quite strong. There are 300,000 Communist Party members and 600,000 Social Democratic Party members.

In order to turn western Germany into a central base for aggression against Europe, American imperialism is painstakingly colluding with Britain and France to merge the occupation zones in an attempt to split the unity of Germany. On September 12 last year, Britain and the United States unilaterally announced the economic and administrative merger of the American and British occupation zones; the Washington US-UK talks in August this year and the London US-UK-France talks in September decided that the US and Britain would jointly manage the Ruhr separately, establish a joint institution, with the United States taking the main responsibility. The industrial level of western Germany is to be raised to the level of 1936, and the annual steel production in the Ruhr is to be 10.7 million tons. Now it is planned to organize a western German government of two or three occupation zones and conclude a separate peace treaty with it.

Since the US, British, and French imperialist blocs are determined to undermine the Potsdam and Yalta Agreements on the German issue for the benefit of their monopoly capitalists, so as to threaten European and world peace, the Soviet Union and the peace-loving and democratic people it represents throughout the world, as well as the German people, will naturally resolutely resist it. Therefore, reflected in the foreign ministers' meeting discussing the German peace treaty, there has been a fierce struggle and divergence of two opinions. The Soviet Union defends the principles of Potsdam and Yalta, and advocates the immediate establishment of a democratic and unified German government to sign a peace treaty and ensure the fulfillment of all obligations to the Allies. Control of Germany should continue until militarism and fascism have been eradicated economically, politically, militarily and culturally. Dissolve all monopoly enterprises and nationalize major industries, the Ruhr industrial zone will be under international joint management, thoroughly implement land reform, promote the democratic life of the German people, ensure that Germany fulfills its obligations to the Allies for reparations, and give the Soviet Union 10% of the western industry that Germany does not need in peacetime as part of the Soviet Union's total compensation of $10 billion. The countries participating in the German peace treaty should only be limited to the five countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and China, as well as Germany's neighboring countries and countries that fought against Germany, and Albania must be included. The time for concluding the peace treaty should be after the establishment of the German government. The US, Britain, and France advocate establishing a so-called "federalized" divided Germany based on a high degree of autonomy of the states, merely disarming Germany militarily, and as long as Germany recognizes this, the Allies can end control, emphasizing so-called "economic unity" before organizing the German government, and unscrupulously raising the level of German industry in order to revive German military industry. Britain and the United States particularly oppose international joint management of the Ruhr, and only agree to conditionally implement land reform and dissolve monopoly enterprises, and try to reduce German reparations (in fact, the United States, Britain, and France have already obtained more than $2 billion in German assets, exceeding the total amount of German reparations to them). The United States also advocates that all UN member states can participate in the German peace treaty as long as they have been at war with Germany, in other words, even countries that have assisted Germany in the past, such as Turkey, must participate. The US, Britain, and France all believe that the time for concluding the peace treaty does not necessarily have to be after the German government is established. Obviously, the struggle between the world's two major camps on the German issue will continue to develop, which not only affects the future fate of Germany, but also affects the stability of the entire world. However, the strength of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the German people's firm will to eradicate the Nazis and establish a unified and democratic Germany, will eventually defeat the despicable reactionary conspiracy of the US, British, and French imperialist blocs.

    今日的德国
    战前，德国是一个军国主义与封建法西斯的国家，全人口中极少数的大资本家和百分之五的容克家族和大地主，统治着七千万左右的德国人民，而百分之六十三以上的工农无产阶级，则呻吟在他们合组的纳粹政权之下。
    在资本主义世界中，战前德国的工业生产曾居第二位，其生产量占全世界总生产量的百分之十二。钢铁年产二千五百万吨，居世界第二位；煤产两亿六千余万吨，居第三位；电力仅次于美国，化学工业供应世界四分之一，造船最盛时亦占世界第二位，水陆转运冠于欧洲，商业流通额只次于美、英。欧洲工业用煤的二分之一均仰给于鲁尔。即在战前，美帝国主义即和纳粹德国经济结了不解之缘，美国独占资本家控制了德国的二百七十八家公司，华尔街对德直接投资在十万万美元以上，九十家美国公司和德国的最大化学托辣斯法尔本公司有着密切的关系，纽约电报电话公司几乎拥有德国二十家电气公司的全部资本，通用公司、美孚公司、福特公司等都和德国的独占资本家血肉相连。纳粹德国于一九四五年五月投降后，他的四十七万平方公里的领土，除奥得河与西尼斯河以东割还波兰外，余皆由盟国划成苏、美、英、法四个占领区，并组织一个盟国管制委员会，以调节各区之行政。德首都柏林则由苏、美、英、法共管。苏占领区在德国东部，人口共二千四百万，耕地占全德百分之三十七，工矿业的生产占全德百分之三十五。美占领区在南部，英占领区在西北部，法占领区则在西南部，美、英、法占领区一般统称之为西部占领区，三个占领区之人口共四千七百五十万，耕地占全德百分之六十三，工矿业生产占全德百分之六十五。苏占领区之德国军火工厂占全德百分之二十，苏占领军为三十万至三十五万；美占领区之德国军火工厂占全德百分之十七，美占领军四十万（一说十三万）；英占领区军火工厂占全德百分之五十四，英占领军二十万人；法占领区军火工厂占全德百分之九，占领军约十万人。英占领区中的鲁尔，是德国工业的心脏，和军国主义与法西斯的策源地，它集中了德国重工业的百分之六十，煤产占战前全德的百分之七十，钢产占全德的三分之二。
    两年半来的事实说明，东西两部占领区是在两条极端相反的路线下进行管制的。
    东部苏联占领区，忠实执行一九四五年二月的雅尔塔协定和同年八月的波茨顿决议，从经济政治到军事各方面，都迅速的肃清了纳粹，根除了军国主义，并建造起德国人民的民主新生活。一切战争工厂、军事设备与纳粹武装都在占领后不久完全解除。土地改革于一九四五年秋季即开始实行，而且很快就全部完成。七千多个有地百公顷以上的大地主和容克家族都被清算，他们的房产、庄园、农具、森林与牲畜牧场都被没收，二百一十五万二千公顷的土地与大量的牲畜农具，都分配给了农民。其中包括无地农民和农业工人一五七、八二三家，贫农五九、二○○家，移民六四、一三○家。托拉斯、卡特尔和大银行收归政府所有，工人则有充分的管制权。一切战贩与纳粹的财产通统没收，和平工业的生产去年即已恢复到盟国管委会规定水平底十分之七。苏联管制德国的政策，不但保证了德国人民能从法西斯反动势力下彻底解放出来，而且保证了德国能走上经济恢复和发展成为民主的爱好和平的国家的道路，而有利于欧洲的与世界的和平。
    苏占区所有反法西斯的政党，如结成反法西斯阵线的统一社会党（共产党与社会民主党于去年四月合并而成）、基督教民主联盟、自由民主党均得自由活动。人民获得了真正的民主权利，去年九月所举行的地方选举中，参加的选民达百分之九十以上，他们选出了七万余德国民主公民参加一四六座城市及二千余个乡村区城的行政工作。由此，在苏占区的民主势力大大增长了，统一社会党的党员已增至一百九十万人。全德职工会的六百五十万会员在这里就有四百万之多，农民互助会的会员达五十万，“自由德国青年”及进步知识分子的“文化联盟”亦拥有庞大的力量，德共领袖波克已经在人民中获得广泛的威信。
    美、英、法在西部占领区的管制，则完全违反波茨顿与雅尔塔协定，它们害怕一个统一而民主的德国，并且妄图利用他们所占领的德国部分领土作为军事的和军事工业的基地，以及欧洲反动势力的堡垒，以便于他们未来的战争冒险和用以反对德国的和其他欧洲各国的民主势力。因此他们尽力卵翼法西斯分子，保留纳粹武力与战争工业，压制民主运动。去年底美占领军司令赦免了八十万小纳粹，大批的纳粹人员仍高居着美、英、法占领区中的经济及行政各部门的要职。美国军官正训练着数千德国青年组合的“开拓者”军事团体，并迫使德国青年继续受军训。英国把七万德军改名成“劳动队”，又把七万名过去波兰流亡政府的军队雇用作警卫，容许一万二千余名所谓“南斯拉夫皇家军队”驻在闵斯德区。法国则召募了五万余德国官兵去屠杀越南人民及镇压其他殖民地人民。在美占领区，至少有一百二十座军器生产工厂，但只决定清除五十二座；英占区至少有二百八十四座，亦只决定清除一百三十九座，而且在执行清除时实行怠工。德国重要的海空基地如基尔港等，都仍然保存。德国独占资本的康采仑、卡特尔和托辣斯原封未动。土地改革根本未实行。盟国管委会所规定之和平工业生产量，实际上大多保持极低水平。因此，德国人民仍陷于饥饿与极端匮乏之中。
    同时，民主政党被禁止有全德的统一组织，共产党与社会民主党的活动受压迫并被禁止合并。但反民主的下萨克森农民党、激进自由主义党和新莱茵党等，却如雨后春笋一般在美、英、法占领区成立起来。
    社会民主党右翼领袖如舒马赫之流，也被利用作反人民的工具。
    虽然如此，西部占领区的德国人民仍然英勇斗争，而且民主力量亦相当强大，共产党员有三十万，社会民主党员有六十万。
    美帝国主义为了要把西部德国变成侵略欧洲的中心基地，更苦心孤诣的勾结英、法合并各占领区，以图分裂德国的统一。去年九月十二日，英、美擅自宣布美、英占领区经济行政合并；今年八月的华盛顿美、英会谈，与九月的美、英、法伦敦会谈，决定美英单独共管鲁尔，设立联合机构，以美国负主责。要把西部德国工业水平提高到一九三六年水平，鲁尔年产钢一千零七十万吨。现在打算组织两个占领区或三个占领区的西部德国政府，并与之单独缔结和约。
    美、英、法帝国主义集团既然决心为了他们独占资本家的利益，如此破坏波茨顿与雅尔塔关于德国问题的协定，以威胁欧洲与世界和平。苏联及其代表的全世界和平民主的人民以及德国人民，自然坚决予以抵抗。因而反映在讨论对德和约的外长会议上，便形成了两种意见的激烈斗争与分歧。苏联捍卫着波茨顿与雅尔塔的原则，主张立即建立民主统一的德国政府，以签订和约并保证对盟国履行一切义务。对德管制应直至经济上、政治上、军事上和文化上的军国主义与法西斯主义都已根绝为止。解散一切垄断企业，并将主要工业收归国有，鲁尔工业区则实行国际共管，彻底实行土地改革，发扬德国人民民主生活，保证德国履行对盟国赔款的义务，并将百分之十的德国平时经济所不需的西部工业给予苏联，作为赔偿苏联总额一百万万美元的一部分。参加对德和约的国家只应限于苏、美、英、法、中五国和德国邻国以及对德作战的国家，阿尔巴尼亚必须包括在内。缔结和约的时间应在德国政府建立之后。美、英、法则主张以高度的各州自治为基础建立一个所谓“联邦化”分裂的德国，仅仅在军事上解除德国武装，而且只要德国承认了这一点，盟国就可结束管制，强调所谓“经济统一”后再组织德国政府，无原则的提高德国工业水平以便复活德国军事工业。英、美特别反对国际共管鲁尔，只同意有条件的实行土地改革与解散垄断企业，力图减少德国赔款（事实上美、英、法早已获得德国资财二百万万美元以上，超过了德国对他们的赔款总数）。美国并主张全体联合国会员国只要曾对德处于作战状态都可参加对德和约，换句话说，连过去协助德国作战的国家如土耳其之流也得参加。美、英、法均认为缔结和约的时间不一定要在德国成立政府之后。显然的，世界两大阵营在德国问题上的斗争，还要发展的，这不仅关系德国未来命运，而且影响整个世界安定。然而以苏联为首的民主和反帝国主义阵营力量的强大，以及德国人民坚决要求肃清纳粹、建立统一而民主的德国的意志，最终一定会战胜美、英、法帝国主义集团卑鄙的反动阴谋。（新华社）
