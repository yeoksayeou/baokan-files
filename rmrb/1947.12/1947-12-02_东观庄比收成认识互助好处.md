　　【This dispatch from our Jinnan bureau on the 27th】 Zhang Dehua of Dongguanzhuang, Yuanchao Fourth District, used to be poor and lazy. People ignored him, and his wife wanted to divorce him. He felt ashamed himself. He wanted to work, but he had no land; he wanted to do business, but he had no capital. After the land reform, he had land and work, and he became more and more energetic. This year, he benefited greatly from mutual aid. When the mutual aid group was formed in May, the six members had no livestock and poor furniture. They dug the ground and made manure together, and also made time to engage in side businesses, earning money to buy an ox and a donkey, as well as some farm tools. They spent a total of 170,000 yuan. This year, each mu of wheat field also received three large carts of manure. The crops in his group also grew very well. Although there were no livestock in the spring and summer, each mu of corn still yielded 150 jin, and they also helped other groups solve their difficulties. Therefore, in the village's comparison of mutual aid and harvest, his group was selected as a model group. At the comparison meeting, everyone identified the benefits of mutual aid. For example, without livestock, many people can pull a plow. One person can only stare blankly. When there is urgent work, everyone can finish it with a single effort. One person can only stomp their feet, with no way to solve it. With mutual aid, tools are also more convenient... Zhang Shiqi did not participate in mutual aid, and he said regretfully: "This year, I was catching mole crickets alone, so tired that I vomited blood, and I still couldn't catch them. Pushing manure, one person can't push it at all. Truly, one person doesn't count as a person, a lone tree doesn't make a forest." Everyone was talking about how good mutual aid is. After this comparison, all the poor and middle peasants in the village want to participate in mutual aid.

　　东观庄比收成认识互助好处
    【本报冀南廿七日电】元朝四区东观庄张德华，从前又穷又懒，人们不理他，老婆也要和他离婚，自己也觉着丢人。想做活吧，没地；做买卖吧，没本。从翻身后，有了地，也有了活干，自己愈干愈有劲。今年搞互助，又沾了大光。五月互助时，六个人没牲口，家具也不好，都是伙掘地，伙造粪，还抽空搞副业，赚的钱买了一头牛，一匹驴，还买了些农具。共花了十七万元。今年麦田每亩又上了三大车粪。他组里庄稼收的也很好。春夏虽没有牲口，每亩棒子还能收一百五十斤，并且还帮助别的组解决困难。因此在全村比互助比收成中，他组被选为模范组。在对比大会上，大家找出了互助的好处。比如没牲口，人多能拉犁。一个人就干瞪眼。有紧活，大家一把劲就干完了。一个人干跺脚，也没办法。互助起来，工具也方便……。张士其没有互助，他后悔的说：“今年我一人捉蝼蛄，累的吐血，还捉不住。推粪一个人也推不动。真是一人不算人，孤树不成林。”大家都乱说互助好。经这样对比后，全村贫农中农都要参加互助。
