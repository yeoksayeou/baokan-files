　　看看下边还有什么困难？
  　岳北专署检查团到各县推动生产
    【本报太岳二十三日电】岳北专署为了认真的贯彻雇贫路线，使冬季生产贷款百分之百的贷给雇贫农，帮助雇贫进行生产，特与银行、工税、贸易局等机关组成冬季生产工作检查团，于十七日分赴沁源、沁县、安泽、屯留、长子腹心地区，进行深入检查。其检查内容着重：（一）各地冬季生产中对雇贫路线的贯彻，是否以全力组织帮助雇贫生产，究竟雇贫当前在生产上的主要困难与迫切要求是什么？（二）冬季生产贷款是否真正全数贷给雇贫，并如何利用这些资金去组织生产，群众对贷款的反映如何？（三）纺织运输结合春耕准备工作中遇到那些障碍和具体困难，如何解决的，现在进行的情况怎样？有何新的创造？（四）运输生产与参战如何互助结合，如何等价交换与分红等。
