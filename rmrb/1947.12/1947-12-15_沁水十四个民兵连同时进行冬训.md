    Qinshui's Fourteen Militia Companies Conduct Winter Training Simultaneously
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 13th] Fourteen militia companies in Qinshui have begun their winter training. In seven days, they mastered 23 basic movement drills, while simultaneously raising their class consciousness, purging the targets of struggle, and purifying the militia ranks. The militia members are highly enthusiastic about the training. For example, the Fourth Company of the Second Battalion had just returned from participating in the war in southern Shanxi. Without even returning home, they threw themselves into training. Guo Liuquan from Huitou Village in the Fifth District had been about to get married twice, but both times it was delayed due to participating in the war. This time, while receiving training in the county, his superiors allowed him to go back to get married, but he said, "Marriage is not as important as training. Let's postpone it." In the learning process, the first priority was to raise everyone's class consciousness and achieve a unified understanding that the militia is a class-based armed force and cannot allow the targets of struggle, local bullies, and ruffians to control weapons. Therefore, with hired peasants and poor peasants as the backbone, 24 bad elements were purged, purifying the militia organization. Following this, under the slogans "Sweat more on the training ground, bleed less on the battlefield" and "If you don't master the techniques, you can't kill the enemy and protect the fruits of your liberation," a learning competition was launched. For example, the Second Battalion and the Third Battalion, the Fifth and Sixth Companies and the Seventh and Eighth Companies, and the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Companies of the Third Battalion, as well as the Second Squad of the First Platoon and the Eighth Squad of the Third Platoon of the Thirteenth Company, all launched challenges. Their challenge letters unanimously demanded mastering techniques and ideological weapons. At the same time, they engaged in mutual teaching and learning, officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, you teach me, and I teach you, to carry out learning and leverage everyone's unique skills. For example, Zhang Daohong, the instructor of the Third Battalion, learned the key movements of the submachine gun from Jia Xingtai, a militiaman from Dongda. County and district cadres set an example by participating in military training, creating a training fever. For example, Zhang Zunjiang, a staff officer of the County Armed Forces Committee's combat training section, Liu Dehan, the organization and training officer, and the directors of the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Districts all participated in military training, causing even the communicators, buglers, and cooks to actively participate in military training. For example, Jia Youyun, a cook from the Third Company, would finish cooking before dawn and participate in morning military training. The team members trained even more tirelessly, day and night. If they missed training during the day due to official duties, they would make it up at night. For example, on the 28th, 32 people missed training to carry coal, and at night, they asked the deputy company commander to give them a make-up lesson under the moonlight.

    沁水十四个民兵连同时进行冬训
    【本报太岳十三日电】沁水民兵十四个连已开始冬季大练兵，七天内学会基本动作二十三项课目，同时提高了阶级觉悟，清洗了斗争对象，纯洁了民兵阵营。民兵对受训情绪很高，如二营四连刚由晋南参战回来，连家也没回，就投入训练；五区回头村郭刘全，曾经两次要结婚，都因参战误了，这次在县受训，上级让他回去结婚，他说：“结婚没受训重要，推后些吧。”在学习过程中，首先提高大家的阶级觉悟一致认识了民兵是阶级武装，不能让斗争对象地痞流氓掌握武器，遂以雇贫为骨干，清洗了二十四个坏分子，纯洁了民兵组织。接着在“操场多流汗，战场少流血”、“掌握不了技术，打不死敌人，保卫不了翻身利益”的口号下，展开了学习竞赛，如二营与三营，五、六连与七、八连，三营十一、十二、十三三连之间，及十三连一排二班，与三排八班，都展开挑战，他们的挑战书上一致要求掌握技术、掌握思想武器，同时他们展开互教互学，官教兵、兵教官，你教我、我教你的互助运动，进行学习，发挥每个人的一技之长。如三营教导员张道宏，对冲锋枪的动作要领，就是东大民兵贾兴泰教会的，县区干部以身作则，参加练武，造成练兵热潮，如县武委会战训科参谋张遵江、组训干事刘德汉、四、五、七区主任都参加练武，致使通讯员、司号员、炊事员等人也积极练武。如三连炊事员贾友云等，赶天明把饭做好，参加早上练武。队员们更是没明没夜的练武，白天出公差误了，黑夜补上。如二十八日有三十二人去担炭误了学习，晚上在月亮下叫副连长给他们补课。
