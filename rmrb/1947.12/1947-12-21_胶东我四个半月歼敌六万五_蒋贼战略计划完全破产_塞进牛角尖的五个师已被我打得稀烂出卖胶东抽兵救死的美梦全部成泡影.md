Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: A correspondent from this branch comprehensively reports on the development and changes in the Jiaodong battle situation over the past four and a half months: Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, who ventured to invade Jiaodong, suffered a combined fierce attack from the People's Liberation Army and local militia. According to incomplete statistics, over the past four and a half months, a total of more than 55,000 Chiang Kai-shek regular troops and more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek security forces, "Homecoming Legions," etc., have been annihilated. This glorious achievement marks the bankruptcy of Chiang Kai-shek's strategic plan. Chiang Kai-shek vainly attempted to seize all of Jiaodong, and then sell this beautiful land to American imperialism while withdrawing troops to reinforce other battlefields in an attempt to reverse his decline. However, this dream has completely evaporated.

Chiang Kai-shek's invasion of Jiaodong can be roughly divided into three periods from the beginning to the present. The first period was from early August to early October, which was the rampant period of Chiang Kai-shek's blind offensive. In early August, under the command of bandit chief Fan Hanjie, Chiang Kai-shek's six reorganized divisions, including the 8th, 9th, 25th, 45th, 54th, and 64th, advanced from the Qingdao-Jimo area and Weixian along the Jiaoji Railway line, meeting east and west, and entered the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway. They then used Jiaoxian, Gaomi, and Changi as bases for a northward offensive. In late August, they invaded the Jiaodong hinterland in three routes, and occupied Yantai on October 1 and Fushan on the 2nd. The enemy's ferocity reached its peak. At the cost of more than 14,700 officers and soldiers annihilated, they occupied fifteen empty cities, including Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Pingdu, Changi, Yexian, Laiyang, Qixia, Zhaoyuan, Longkou, Huangxian, Penglai, Fushan, Yantai, Muping, and Zhucheng. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops invaded the Jiaodong hinterland, the People's Liberation Army bravely resisted and depleted the enemy's strength on the one hand, and lured the enemy deep to annihilate them at opportune moments on the other. In early September, the People's Liberation Army first blocked Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 9th Division, which was advancing eastward from Changi, and the reorganized 25th Division, which was advancing northward from Gaomi, near the We River, Wuwang Mountain, and Wenwang Mountain west of Pingdu, annihilating more than 1,000 enemies in the southern suburbs of Pingdu. From the 9th to the 11th, they again killed and wounded more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who continued to advance northward from Pingdu at Gaowang Mountain and Fenghuang Mountain on the border of Pingdu and Yexian. At the same time, another unit of the People's Liberation Army encircled and attacked Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 64th Division, which had sneaked into Zhucheng, south of the Jiaoji Road, annihilating more than 2,000 of them. On the left flank, Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 54th Division and the 57th Brigade of the New 74th Division were annihilated, losing more than 600 men at Lingshan, north of Jimo, on the 15th. On the 17th, the People's Liberation Army again struck Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 54th Division and the reorganized 25th Division, which were advancing on Laiyang in two routes, at Shuigoutou, southwest of Laiyang, annihilating more than 1,600 of them. On the 18th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 3,500 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops of the reorganized 8th Division in the Daotou area, southwest of Zhaoyuan, making a beneficial contribution to reversing the Jiaodong battle situation. These two battles, east and west, began to frustrate Chiang Kai-shek's ferocity. From then on, the People's Liberation Army, with a heroic advance that was unexpected by Chiang Kai-shek, inserted itself into the enemy's flanks and rear. From the 26th to the 28th, in the Daze Mountain area along the border of Pingdu, Zhaoyuan, Laiyang, and Yexian, they blocked two brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 9th Division, which had fled back to Pingdu, annihilating more than 2,000 of them. From the 27th to October 3, Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 25th Division and reorganized 54th Division were repeatedly attacked by local soldiers and civilians in Gongshan, north of Qixia, Gongjia and Weiyu, east of Laiyang, Mashi Mountain, west of Fushan, Cishan in the northwest, and Jiaheli, west of Yantai, and more than 3,400 of them were annihilated.

The second period was from the beginning of October's Jiahe River Campaign to the beginning of November, which was the period when Chiang Kai-shek's blind offensive was crushed and he was forced to switch to a comprehensive defense; more than 24,350 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops were annihilated. When the People's Liberation Army inserted itself behind Chiang and launched a long-distance southern expedition, Chiang Kai-shek suddenly woke up and hurriedly ordered his direct line reorganized 9th Division to flee west in a hurry after the attack failed, and ordered his miscellaneous troops, the reorganized 64th and 45th Divisions, to clear the way and meet them. However, it was too late. The People's Liberation Army, who were waiting to ambush the fish, surrounded the fleeing enemy in the Jiahe River area south of Changi. From October 3rd to 9th, they annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 45th Division, 211th Brigade (lacking one battalion), three regiments of the reorganized 64th Division, and parts of the reorganized 8th and 9th Divisions, totaling more than 12,000, and took the opportunity to recover Changi City. Since then, the Jiaodong People's Liberation Army has seized the initiative in the war and began to switch to a counter-offensive. Prior to this, on the night of September 11, the People's Liberation Army swept across the Gaomi-Weixian section of the Jiaoji Railway, attacking more than 20 station strongholds such as Zhuyang, Dashan, Gaogezhuang, and Shangxinzhuang, annihilating more than 1,500 enemies and controlling 60 miles of railway, making a prelude to the Jiahe River victory. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army recovered Yexian City on October 4, annihilating an entire regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 8th Division and more than 2,700 "Homecoming Legions," effectively holding back Chiang Kai-shek's northern line. On the 5th, Chiang Kai-shek first occupied Weihaiwei City. Under the siege of local soldiers and civilians, Chiang Kai-shek fled in panic by the 9th. On the 10th, the enemy in Muping and Qixia also abandoned their cities and fled, and the above three places were recovered by us. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yantai and Fushan repeatedly sneaked into Shizi Mountain, south of Fushan, on the 5th and 6th, and were killed and wounded by us, losing more than 660 men. In the battle of Zhanggezhuang, southeast of Pingdu, on the 9th, we destroyed 57 enemy trucks and killed, wounded, and captured more than 140 enemies. In the battle of Qugezhuang, southeast of Laiyang, on the 13th, 700 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops of the reorganized 25th Division who attacked Laiyang were annihilated. On the 15th, we captured Sunshou and Dongxiagezhuang, two strongholds on the Yantai-Qingdao Highway southwest of Laiyang, annihilating a regiment of the 57th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's New 74th Division and a battalion of the 17th Engineer Regiment, totaling more than 2,300 men. On the same day, the People's Liberation Army recovered Zhucheng. The 159th Brigade's baggage battalion of the reorganized 64th Division of the defending Chiang Kai-shek bandits, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek County Government and "Homecoming Legions," totaling more than 3,150 men, were all annihilated without a single one escaping. Under a series of powerful blows from us, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, in order to struggle to the death, launched a defensive "encirclement and suppression" of the Jiaodong hinterland on the 25th, vainly attempting to change their predicament. They divided three brigades of troops and simultaneously "encircled and suppressed" the Kuangqi Mountain area on the border of Laiyang and Qixia and the Ai'gu Mountain area on the border of Penglai, Huangxian, Qixia, and Zhaoyuan, from Laiyang and Huangxian in the south and north, respectively. Another two brigades of troops divided from Pingdu and Lancun and jointly attacked and "encircled and suppressed" the Pingdu-Jiaoxian area. The People's Liberation Army unexpectedly controlled the enemy and sneaked into Laiyang City on the 27th, and then returned to sweep away strongholds such as Shuigoutou, Sunshou, and Dongxiagezhuang on the Yantai-Qingdao Road, and cut off the Pingdu-Laiyang Road on the 31st, recovering Zhanggezhuang southeast of Pingdu. By November 2, a total of more than 1,200 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops had been annihilated, and the remaining bandits were forced to flee back, and the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" conspiracy was shattered. The People's Liberation Army then recovered Zhaoyuan City on the 3rd, and part of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 8th Division abandoned the city and fled north.

The third period is from the battle of Jiaogao Line on November 6 to the present. This period is when Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops switched from a comprehensive defense to a line of defense along the Beihai coast, and the isolated strongholds are trapped. Even the isolated strongholds have been basically removed by us, and only the defense of the Beihai line remains. From November 6 to December 13, in just one month and eight days, the People's Liberation Army annihilated Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops and "Homecoming Legions," etc., totaling 26,150, which is more than the previous two periods. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops passively parried, while the People's Liberation Army was able to maneuver freely and fiercely annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. On November 6, Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 9th Division and other five and a half brigades attempted to flee west along the Jiaoji Railway for the second time, but were intercepted by the People's Liberation Army in Zhangling and Zhuyang between Gaomi and Weixian. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops failed to flee west, and were forced to turn around and flee east by the 13th. The People's Liberation Army immediately tracked and pursued them, and by the 17th, a total of more than 3,000 bandits had been annihilated, and Pingdu City was recovered on the 8th. Jiaoxian City was recovered on the 21st. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 54th Division headquarters led five regiments and ventured to sneak into Haiyang from Laiyang on the 5th, and Haiyang was surrounded by us on three sides on the 8th. On the 17th, after annihilating more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who had invaded Weihaiwei, we took the initiative to withdraw from the city for the second time. At this point, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Jiaodong were forced to switch to a defense on a narrow line along the Beihai coast, including Longkou, Huangxian, Penglai, and Yantai, as well as isolated strongholds trapped in Gaomi, Haiyang, and Laiyang. The People's Liberation Army became stronger and stronger, continuously annihilating the enemy and removing isolated strongholds. From November 8 to December 6, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Haiyang repeatedly attempted to break through by land, but were completely crushed by us, annihilating more than 3,200 bandits. The remaining bandits were forced to flee to Qingdao by sea, and Haiyang City was recovered by us on December 11. While besieging Haiyang, another unit of the People's Liberation Army blocked three brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who were vainly attempting to provide eastern aid to Haiyang in the Jinkou area northeast of Jimo. From November 25 to December 2, more than 3,600 bandits were annihilated, forcing them to flee back in a panic. On November 27, the People's Liberation Army captured Gaomi, annihilating an entire regiment of the defending bandits of the reorganized 64th Division and the Chiang Kai-shek County Government "Homecoming Legions," totaling more than 1,800 men. On December 7, part of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 8th Division in Huangxian abandoned the city and fled west to Longkou, and were pursued by us en route, annihilating more than 550 of them, and Huangxian City was recovered by us. On the night of the 13th, the People's Liberation Army once again captured Laiyang City in one fell swoop, annihilating all the defending enemies, totaling more than 10,000. In the four days from the 10th to the 13th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army defeated eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops who were providing northern aid on the Shuigoutou and Dayetou line southwest of Laiyang, annihilating more than 3,000 of them. The People's Liberation Army went from blocking to pursuing, from pursuing to encircling and annihilating, and won victory after victory. It was truly invincible and invincible. As for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Weihaiwei, they were intimidated by the power of our military and civilian guerrilla warfare and landmine warfare, and have so far been hovering in the suburbs of the city, not daring to invade the urban area.

Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in Jiaodong, except for the reorganized 25th Division, which boarded ships from Yantai and was transferred elsewhere in early November, the remaining five reorganized divisions have all been severely hit by us and are in a dilapidated state. The reporter concluded: Just as the People's Liberation Army is launching a nationwide strategic counter-offensive, Chiang Kai-shek foolishly crammed six reorganized divisions into the dead end of Jiaodong, blindly crashing and fleeing, while the soldiers and civilians of East China grabbed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops and refused to let go, giving them a fierce beating and annihilation, greatly reducing the burden of our external offensive troops, and writing a glorious page in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's struggle. As the reporter pointed out when commenting on the great victory in Jiaodong: "The East China People's Liberation Army must cooperate with the nationwide counter-offensive, close the gate of Jiaodong tightly, and annihilate the invading Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the dead end of Jiaodong." Now, in addition to losing more than 65,000 troops, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops trapped in a corner of the Beihai coast are also facing the fate of complete annihilation.

　　胶东我四个半月歼敌六万五
  　蒋贼战略计划完全破产
  　塞进牛角尖的五个师已被我打得稀烂出卖胶东抽兵救死的美梦全部成泡影
    【新华社华东十九日电】分社记者综合报导四个半月来胶东战局的发展变化：冒险进犯胶东的蒋匪，遭受解放军及当地地武民兵合力痛击，四个半月来，据不完全统计：共歼蒋匪正规军五万五千余名及蒋记保安队“还乡团”等万余名。这一光辉战绩标志着蒋贼战略计划的破产，蒋贼妄图霸占全胶东后，一面将这块大好河山拱手出卖给美帝国主义，一面抽兵增援其他战场以挽其颓势，但是这个美梦已全成泡影。
    蒋贼进犯胶东从开始到现在，大体上可以分成三个时期，第一个时期是八月初至十月初，是蒋贼盲目攻势的猖獗时期。八月初在匪首范汉杰指挥下之蒋匪八、九、二五、四五、五四、六四等六个整编师，分自青（岛）即（墨）地区及潍县沿胶济线东西会犯，打进了胶济东段，复以胶县、高密、昌邑为北犯基地，八月下旬分三路侵入胶东内地，直至十月一日占领烟台，二日占领福山，敌之凶焰达于顶点。先后以一万四千七百余官兵被歼之代价侵占了胶县、高密、平度、昌邑、掖县、莱阳、栖霞、招远、龙口、黄县、蓬莱、福山、烟台、牟平、诸城等十五座空城。当蒋匪进犯胶东内地时，解放军一面英勇阻击消耗敌人力量，一面诱敌深入相机聚歼。九月上旬解放军首在平度以西之潍河畔与武王山、文王山等地阻击由昌邑东犯之蒋匪整九师，在平度南郊阻击由高密北犯之整二十五师，共歼敌千余。九日至十一日复在平（度）掖（县）边境之高望山、凤凰山杀伤续由平度北犯蒋匪六百余名。同时，解放军另一部在胶济路南围击窜入诸城之蒋匪整六十四师歼其二千余。左翼蒋匪整五十四师及新七十四师五十七旅，十五日在即墨北之灵山被歼六百余名。十七日解放军又在莱阳西南之水沟头打击两路进犯莱阳之蒋匪整五四师与整二十五师，歼其一千六百余。十八日解放军另部则在招远西南道头地区歼灭左翼蒋匪整八师三千五百余名，对扭转胶东战局作了有益的贡献，这两个战役东西交辉，开始挫败了蒋匪的凶焰。从此解放军即以事出蒋贼意外之英勇进军，插入蒋匪侧后，二十六日至二十八日在平（度）招（远）莱（阳）掖（县）边沿之大泽山区堵击回窜平度蒋匪整九师之两个旅，歼其二千余名。二十七日至十月三日，蒋匪整二五师及整五四师在栖霞北之宫山、莱阳东之宫家、苇峪、福山西之马山及西北之磁山、烟台西之甲河历等地连遭当地军民痛击，被歼三千四百余名。
    第二个时期是十月初旬胶河战役至十一月初，是蒋匪的盲目攻势被粉碎，被迫转入全面防御的时期；蒋匪被歼二万四千三百五十余名。当解放军插入蒋后远途南征时，蒋贼这才如梦初醒，赶紧命令他的嫡系整九师于扑空之余急忙西窜，又命令他的杂牌整六四、四五两师开路与接应，然而时已晚矣。张网待鱼的解放军将西逃之敌团团包围于昌邑以南之胶河地区，从十月三日至九日，一举歼灭蒋匪整四五师二一一旅（缺一个营）、整六四师三个团，整八师、整九师各一部共一万二千余众，并乘胜收复昌邑城。从此胶东解放军夺得了战争的主动权，开始转入反攻。在此以前解放军曾于九月十一日夜横扫胶济线高（密）潍（县）段，攻入朱阳、＠山、高戈庄、上信庄等车站据点二十余处，歼敌一千五百余，控制铁路六十里，作了胶河大捷的前奏。解放军另部于十月四日收复掖县城，全歼蒋匪整八师一个团，及“还乡团”等二千七百余名，有力的扯住北线蒋匪的后腿。五日蒋匪第一次侵占威海卫市，在当地军民困击下至九日蒋匪即仓惶撤走。十日牟平、栖霞之敌亦弃城逃窜，上述三地遂为我收复。烟台、福山蒋匪于五、六两日连向福山南狮子山窜犯，被我杀伤六百六十余名，九日平度东南张哥庄之战，我击毁敌卡车五十七辆，毙伤俘敌一百四十余名。十三日莱阳东南曲格庄之战，歼灭莱阳出犯蒋匪整二五师七百余名。十五日我攻克莱阳西南烟（台）青（岛）公路上孙受、东夏格庄两据点，歼蒋匪新七四师五七旅一个团及工兵十七团一个营共二千三百余名。同日解放军收复诸城，守城蒋匪整六四师一五九旅辎重营及蒋记县府，“还乡团”等三千一百五十余名全部就歼，无一漏网。蒋匪在我一连串的有力打击下，为垂死挣扎，乃于二十五日发动对胶东内地的防御性“清剿”，妄图改变其困境，以三个旅兵力分自莱阳、黄县南、北同时“清剿”莱（阳）栖（霞）边之旷旗山区，及蓬莱、黄县、栖（霞）招（远）边之艾崮山区，另以两个旅兵力分自平度、兰村南北合击“清剿”平（度）胶（县）地区。解放军出奇制敌，于二十七日乘虚袭入莱阳城，旋即回师横扫烟（台）青（岛）路水沟头、孙受、东夏格庄等据点，并于三十一日斩断平（度）莱（阳）路，收复平度东南张哥庄，至十一月二日先后共歼蒋匪一千二百余名，余匪被迫回窜，敌“清剿”阴谋遂被粉碎。解放军继于三日收复招远城，蒋匪整八师一部弃城北窜。
    第三个时期即十一月六日胶高线大战迄今。这个时期是蒋匪从全面防御转入北海沿岸的一线防御，及某些孤立据点的困守，甚至孤立据点亦已基本上被我拔除，而仅存北海一线的防御了。自十一月六日至十二月十三日仅一个月零八天，解放军歼灭蒋匪及“还乡团”等共达二万六千一百五十余名，较前两个时期均多。蒋匪被动招架，而解放军则机动自如痛歼蒋匪。十一月六日，蒋匪整九师等五个半旅二次企图沿胶济线西逃，被解放军拦击于高（密）潍（县）间丈岭、朱阳等地，蒋匪西逃未逞，至十三日被迫扭头东窜，解放军当即跟踪追击，至十七日止共歼匪三千余，并于八日收复平度城。二十一日收复胶县城。与此同时，蒋匪整五四师师部率五个团于五日由莱阳冒险窜陷海阳，八日海阳即为我三面包围。十七日我于歼灭进犯威海卫之蒋匪千余名后，二次主动撤离该市，至此胶东蒋匪乃被迫转入北海沿岸龙口、黄县、蓬莱、福山、烟台狭长一线的防御，以及高密、海阳、莱阳等孤立据点的困守。解放军则愈战愈强，连续不断歼灭敌人，拔除孤立据点。十一月八日至十二月六日，海阳蒋匪屡次企图由陆上突围，终被我彻底粉碎，歼匪三千二百余，余匪被迫由海上窜逃青岛，海阳城遂于十二月十一日为我收复。与围困海阳同时，解放军另部在即墨东北金口地区堵击妄图东援海阳之蒋匪三个旅，自十一月二十五日至十二月二日歼匪三千六百余，迫使其狼狈回窜。十一月二十七日解放军攻克高密，全歼守匪整六四师一个团及蒋记县府“还乡团”等共计一千八百余名。十二月七日黄县蒋匪整八师一部弃城西逃龙口，途中被我追击，歼其五百五十余，黄县城即为我收复。十三日夜，解放军又一举攻克莱阳城，全歼守敌万余。十日至十三日四天中，解放军另部则在莱阳西南水沟头、大野头一线击溃北援蒋匪八个旅，歼其三千余。解放军从阻击到追击，从追击到围歼，胜利接连胜利，真是战无不胜，攻无不克。而威海卫方面蒋匪慑于我军民游击战地雷战之威力，迄今仍徘徊市郊未敢侵入市区。
    胶东蒋匪除整二五师于十一月初自烟台登轮他调外，其余五个整编师均遭我严重打击，破烂不堪。记者最后称：正当人民解放军举行全国战略总反攻时，蒋贼愚蠢地将六个整编师塞进胶东牛角尖里，盲目撞窜，而华东军民则揪住蒋匪不放，予以痛打痛歼，大大减轻我外线出击部队之负担，在中国人民解放军斗争史上写下光辉的一页。正如记者在评胶东大捷时即已指出的：“华东解放军要配合全国大反攻，要关紧胶东的大门，把进犯的蒋匪军消灭在胶东的牛角尖里”。现在蒋匪除已损兵折将六万五千余名外，其困踞北海沿线一隅之蒋匪亦已面临全部覆没的命运了。
