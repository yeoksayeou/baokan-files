　　The Zhongwujing village in the First District held a mass meeting on the night of the 10th of this month in the winter school to summarize the transportation achievements of the past eleven days. Through resolving the difficulties of poor hired peasants, considerable achievements were made in the past eleven days: thirty-nine newly emancipated hired laborers and sixteen animals transported goods, earning 300,400 yuan. Thirty-three old middle peasant laborers and twenty-two animals transported goods, earning 121,900 yuan. The hired poor peasants earned two-thirds more than the middle peasants. In weaving, a total of 154 catties of cotton were spun and 114 catties of cloth were woven. Forty-three poor peasant women spun and wove 87 catties; thirty-nine middle peasants spun and wove 67 catties. In weaving, it can also be seen that the poor peasant women achieved more than the middle peasant women. This is also because the poor peasant women were first mobilized to take the lead, which resulted in such achievements. After mobilizing the poor hired peasants, from cadres to the masses, they mobilized and organized simultaneously, with the poor hired peasants as the main force in organizing winter production. Out of the entire village of 182 laborers, 164 were organized, forming 19 transportation teams. Sixteen of the team leaders were newly emancipated hired peasants, and three were middle peasants. This also shows that the poor hired peasants played a backbone leadership role in winter production. The team leaders of the thirteen weaving teams were all new middle peasants. As the poor woman Huang Buli said: "In the past, the landlords and rich peasants were the team leaders of the weaving teams. They knew how to weave, but we didn't, so we suffered a lot. This winter, our poor peasant women must first learn to weave." In the production led by the poor hired peasants, some middle peasants reflected: This winter, the poor hired peasants are in charge, and we middle peasants don't count. During class, the idea of "poor and middle peasants are one family, organizing to get rich" was put forward, dispelling the concerns of the middle peasants. This is also one of the reasons for the success.

　　中五井雇贫带头运输
  　十一天赚四十余万
    【本报平顺讯】一区中五井村，本月十日夜在冬学召开了群众会，总结十一天运输成绩。十一天来经过解决雇贫困难，获得相当成绩：新翻身的雇贫劳力三十九个，牲口十六头，运输赚洋三十万零四千元。旧中农三十三个劳力，牲口二十二头，运输赚洋十二万一千九百元。雇贫农比中农多赚三分之二。在纺织上共纺花一百五十四斤，织布一百一十四斤，雇贫农妇女四十三个，纺织八十七斤；中农三十九个，纺织六十七斤；在纺织上也可看出雇贫妇女比中农妇女成绩大，这也是首先发动了雇贫妇女起带头，才有这样成绩。全村经过发动雇贫，从干部到群众，一面发动一面组织，以雇贫为主的组织了冬季生产，全村一百八十二个劳力，组织起一百六十四个，组成运输小组十九个，小组长有新翻身的雇贫十六个，中农三个，这也可看出雇贫在冬季生产中起了骨干领导作用。十三个纺织小组，小组长都是新中农。如贫苦妇女黄不礼说：“过去纺织组都是人家地主富农当组长，人家会织咱不会，吃亏不少，今冬咱雇贫妇女先要学会织布。”在以雇贫为主的生产中，有些中农反映说：今冬是雇贫作主，咱这中农不算话。在上课时又提出“中贫农是一家，组织起来闹发家”，也打破了中农的顾虑。这也是取得成绩的原因之一。
