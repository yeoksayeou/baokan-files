Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th -- After the People's Liberation Army recovered key areas such as Jiaoxian and Gaomi, controlling over 200 li of the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, the Jiaodong, Central Shandong, and Northern Shandong liberated areas were once again connected, returning to the state before the Chiang bandits' offensive in August. In the three months since the Chiang bandits attacked Jiaodong, nearly 40,000 of their regular troops have been annihilated. Currently, the Chiang bandits in Jiaodong are compressed into a narrow coastal line from Longkou, Yantai to Weihaiwei, and isolated cities such as Haiyang and Laiyang, with their retreat cut off. At the beginning of August, the Chiang bandits gathered six reorganized divisions, the Eighth, Fifty-fourth, Ninth, Twenty-fifth, Forty-fifth, and Sixty-fourth, commanded by the bandit leader Fan Hanjie, and launched a two-pronged attack from Qingdao and Weixian, occupying Jiaoxian on the 6th, Gaomi on the 15th, and Changyi on the 21st, opening the Jiaoji line. Thus, with fierce momentum, they continued to attack northward from Jiaoxian, Gaomi, and Changyi, attempting to completely occupy Jiaodong and offer it to American imperialism as a base. Chiang Kai-shek also personally flew to Qingdao on August 18th to "personally instruct" Wang Yaowu and Fan Hanjie, declaring that he would "solve the Jiaodong problem within a month." The People's Liberation Army, according to the predetermined plan, waited for the enemy to penetrate deeply and disperse, then rose up to give them a painful blow. In the Battle of Daotou, Zhaoyuan, on September 18th, an entire regiment of the Chiang bandit's Eighth Reorganized Division was wiped out. On October 4th, Yexian was recovered, and another regiment of the Chiang bandit's Eighth Reorganized Division was completely annihilated, opening the prelude to the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive in Jiaodong. In early October, a part of the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared between Gaomi and Weixian on the Jiaoji Railway, capturing over 20 railway station strongholds such as @Shan and Zhuyang, controlling over 60 li of the railway. Subsequently, between Changyi and the Jiao River south, the People's Liberation Army dealt a heavy blow to the fleeing Chiang bandit's Ninth Reorganized Division, creating a great victory of annihilating over 12,000 enemies. During this period, the People's Liberation Army also recovered cities such as Qixia, Muping, Zhucheng, Changyi, and Weihaiwei (note that our army voluntarily transferred from the city on the 17th of this month) and vast rural areas. On November 3rd, Zhaoyuan City was also recovered. On the 6th, the People's Liberation Army once again approached the Gaomi-Weixian section of the Jiaoji Railway, defeating five and a half brigades of the Chiang bandit's Ninth Reorganized Division, etc., which attempted to flee west twice, annihilating over 3,000 enemies. The remnants fled east in a panic. The People's Liberation Army pursued and successively captured the three cities of Pingdu, Jiaoxian, and Gaomi, controlling the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway from Fangzi southeast of Weixian in the west to the Gu River east of Jiaoxian for over 200 li, creating a new and favorable situation for the People's Liberation Army.
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 30th -- The Chiang bandits who re-occupied Weihaiwei suffered from our siege. On the 22nd, our army launched a night attack on the Chiang bandits in Beishan, Huaiyun Village, eight li northwest of Weihai City. Most of a company of the defending enemy was annihilated, with over 40 enemies killed or wounded, and three including a deputy platoon leader captured, and one light machine gun and five rifles and carbines seized. On the 25th, our army killed or wounded four enemies eight li directly north of Weihai City.

　　胶东三个月歼匪四万
    与鲁中滨北接连一片
    蒋匪退路断绝龟缩沿海孤城
    【新华社华东三十日电】解放军收复胶县、高密等要地，控制胶济路东段二百余里后，胶东、鲁中、滨北解放区再连成一片，恢复到八月蒋匪进攻前的态势。蒋匪自进攻胶东迄今三个多月来，仅其正规军被歼者即近四万人。现胶东蒋匪被压缩于龙口、烟台至威海卫沿海狭长一线及海阳、莱阳等孤城内，退路已被断绝。八月初蒋匪集结第八、五十四、九、二十五、四十五、六十四共六个整编师，由匪首范汉杰指挥，分由青岛、潍县东西会犯，六日占胶县，十五日陷高密，二十一日占昌邑，打通了胶济线，于是气势凶凶，继续由胶、高、昌三路北犯，妄图全部侵占胶东，拱手出卖给美帝国主义作基地。蒋贼并于八月十八日亲飞青岛，对王耀武、范汉杰“面授机宜”，声言“一个月内解决胶东问题”。解放军则按照预定计划，待敌深入分散后，即奋起予以痛击。九月十八日招远道头一战，蒋贼整八师一个团全部覆没。十月四日克复掖县，又全歼蒋匪整八师一个团，揭开了解放军在胶东的反攻序幕。十月初，解放军一部突然出现胶济路高潍间，攻克＠山、朱阳等车站据点二十余处，控制铁路六十余里。旋于昌（邑）南胶河间痛击西逃蒋匪整九师等，创造了歼敌一万二千余众的大胜利。在此时期中，解放军还收复了栖霞、牟平、诸城、昌邑及威海卫（按该市我军于本月十七日又主动转移）等城市及广大农村。十一月三日，又收复招远城。六日，解放军再度兵临胶济路高潍段，打败了两次企图西逃的蒋匪整九师等五个半旅，歼敌三千余，残敌狼狈扭头东窜，解放军跟踪追击，连克平度、胶县、高密三城，控制胶济路东段西自潍县东南之坊子，东至胶县东之沽河二百余里，造成予解放军目前有利之新形势。
    【新华社华东三十日电】再度侵踞威海卫之蒋匪，遭我困袭。二十二日，我军夜袭威市西北八里槐云村北山蒋匪，守敌一连大部就歼，毙伤敌四十余名，俘副排长等三名，缴轻机枪一挺，长短枪五枝。廿五日，我军又于威市正北八里处毙伤敌四名。
