Just Issuing Calls Is Useless!
    Village Cadres Don't Provide In-Depth Leadership
    Huangnian's Winter Production Runs On Its Own

[Our Newspaper, Lucheng News] Huangnian in the Fourth District is a large village with over 500 households. Since the "Three Seizures" movement, cadres have not effectively led and organized the masses for production, only busying themselves with fragmented errands. They believe that winter production work is easy and can be accomplished with a single call. When the district held meetings, the village's main cadres, complacent in their thinking, did not participate well. They only used simple methods to mobilize people briefly at the three civilian schools in the north, south, and center streets of the village and considered the matter done. Because Huangnian is located along a main road, there are many errands, requiring twenty laborers and livestock and ten carts daily. Village cadres do not organize and find ways to solve this through work exchange, but simply use administrative orders to assign tasks, turning task assignment into a perfunctory matter. Whether there are tasks or not, dozens of laborers and livestock are wasted at home waiting daily. Some speculators are out transporting goods with their livestock and cannot return, while laborers and livestock at home are assigned tasks every day, leading to Ding Qimei and Wang Xiaochou selling their livestock. Street chief of the North Street, Zhang Biantou, said, "I am a peasant who has been liberated. I am a street chief, but I can't do anything. Everything has to be done by me alone. The masses are all engaged in production, and I am very anxious. The village chief and the anti-requisition director look for me every day, demanding this and that. I didn't harvest much grain this year, and I can't even get through the winter. I used to beg for food, and if this continues, I'll have to go back to begging next spring." The town chief, deputy town chief, and the chairman of the peasant association sell bowls and flowers on the streets, engaging in speculative business. They issue orders for any work but do not oversee how to organize winter production. Wei Zhaosheng, the street chief of South Street, used the loans that the bank gave to the peasants for private business, going to Ping Shun to collect eggs. The central and northern streets used the 200,000 yuan in loans to pay for the expenses of grain delivery porters. All of this prevented the loans from playing their due role in supporting mass production. After the leading comrades in the district discovered this serious phenomenon, they immediately convened a meeting of all village cadres for self-criticism. Gao Longzhong, the manager of the cooperative, said, "Our village has the conditions for production; it's not that we can't do it well. The main reason is that our village cadres have not provided in-depth, specific organizational leadership." Wei Qiusheng, the political director, said, "Our ability is weak; one hand can't clap." Then, the village chief and various cadres made self-criticisms one by one, resolving to change their style and improve production work. (Xingfu, Genbao, Duanlang)

[Our Newspaper, Shahe News] After completing the grain transport task on the 7th of this month, Nanwang in the Sixth District summarized the previous twenty days of winter production. They discovered that cadres had serious complacency and were not closely focused on winter production. The village chief and director both said, "Let's rest for a few days first." After discovering these thoughts, they went door-to-door to investigate the difficulties of poor peasants and women in spinning. They discovered that Shi Jianglin's family of three had harvested a total of five bags of autumn grain, delivered 43 catties of public grain, and planted one mu of cotton. Due to the spring drought, they harvested a total of 30 catties of cotton, which they sold and spent as they picked. Now it is all gone, and they want to spin cotton, but they don't even have a piece of cotton at home. Liu Zhou's wife and one other person harvested three dou of sorghum and delivered 20 catties of public grain. Now they are about to run out of food. Wen Chou Niang and one other person harvested three bags of buckwheat, returned 20 catties of rice to others, and delivered 42 catties of public grain. Now they only have one bag of buckwheat left. After discovering these five households, they convened a meeting of all village cadres that night, using facts to educate them and break their paralysis. The political director, Shi Chunzhang, said, "I already knew about these things, but now the peasant association doesn't have anything to relieve them. I want to wait for the review so they can have a good turn!" (Clearly an act of charity! --Editor) Cooperative chief Zheng Yue said: "I see that our village planted a lot of cotton this year, and I never thought that these households would not have cotton to spin. Today, the United Cooperative asked me to pull 200 catties of cotton. I thought no one would spin it, so I pulled 150 catties. It looks like another 200 catties would not be enough to spin." Li Shaoyu, the chairman of the peasant association, said, "I just came back from transporting grain. When I saw that the village's side-line businesses were doing well, I thought, 'This is almost done!'" Village chief Shi Duichao said: "We are all poor people, and we say that we represent the poor. What kind of work is this?" The thirteen village cadres all reflected on the fact that they had not gone into the homes of poor peasants and hired laborers, did not understand their difficulties, and only now broke their paralysis and complacency. Everyone unanimously recognized that they should first investigate what difficulties the poor peasants and hired laborers have in production, solve them immediately, and organize them for production immediately. Now they are further conducting in-depth inspections. (Gao Meng, Meng Ling)

    光发号召不顶事！
    村干不作深入领导
    黄碾冬季生产自流
    【本报潞城讯】四区黄碾是五百余户大村镇，自从三抢运动后，干部没有很好去领导组织群众生产，只忙于零碎差务工作，认为冬季生产工作好办，一号召就行了。区上开会，该村主要干部因思想上自满，就没有很好参加，只在村南北中三街民校用简单方法动员了一下算了事。因黄碾沿大路，差务较多，每天得二十个劳畜力，十辆大车听差，村干部不去加以组织，想办法变工解决，而只是用简单的行政命令派差，支差成了应付公事。每天不管有差没差，得误几十个劳畜力在家等。有些投机户赶上牲口在外运输不回来，在家的劳畜力则天天支差，因此产生了丁其美、王小丑卖牲口的现象。北街街长张扁头说：“我是翻了身的一个农民，担任了街长，什么也不能干了，什事也得我一个人办，群众都搞生产去了，自己心中很发急，村长、抗勤主任每天找我，不要这就要那，我今年打的粮食不多，连冬天也过不去，我以前是要饭讨吃，再要这样下去，明年春天我只好还去要饭吧。”镇长、副镇长、农会主席，每天在街上卖碗卖花，做投机买卖，有什么工作就下个命令，对于如何组织冬季生产不去过问。南街街长魏招胜，把银行给农民贷的款拿去做私人买卖，到平顺去收鸡蛋。中街、北街把贷的二十万元款给送公粮脚户化费了。这都使贷款没有起了扶助群众生产的应有作用。区上领导同志发现此种严重现象后，马上即召开全村干部会议，进行检讨。合作社经理高龙中说：“咱村生产有条件，不是搞不好，主要是咱村干部没有深入具体组织领导。”政治主任魏秋盛说：“咱能力弱，一只手拍不响。”接着村长及各干部一一作了检讨，要转变作风，把生产工作搞好。  （兴福、根保、端郎）
    【本报沙河讯】六区南汪在本月七号结束运粮任务后，就总结前廿天冬季生产，发现干部自满思想严重，对冬季生产抓的不紧，村长、主任都说先休息几天再说吧。发现这些思想后，就挨门挨户深入检查贫雇妇女在纺织上的困难，发现石江林娘三口人共收秋粮五口袋，出公粮四十三斤，种了一亩花，春天旱，共摘了三十斤花，一面摘一面卖一面化，现在卖完了，也化完了，想纺花，家中连一片花也没有。刘周的妻一口人，收了三斗高粱，出了二十斤公粮，现在眼看就没啥吃了。文丑娘一口人，打了三口袋荞麦，还人家米二十斤，出了四十二斤公粮，现在只有一口袋荞麦了。发现这五户后，当晚上召开全村干部会，拿事实教育打破麻痹。政治主任石春章说：“这些事我早就了解，就是现在农会没有东西去救济他们，我想再等复查时叫他们好好翻翻身哩！”（显然是恩赐视点！——编者）合作社长正月说：“我看咱村今年种花很多，我就根本没想到这些户没花纺，今天联合社叫我去拉花二百斤，我想没人纺，我就拉了一百五十斤，这样看起来再有二百斤也不够纺。”农会主任李绍玉说：“我才运粮回来，一看咱村副业搞起来了，我心中想：这一下可差不多了！”村长石对朝说：“咱们都是穷人，成天说代表穷人办事哩，这算干的啥？”十三个村干部都反省了自己没有深入到贫雇家中去，不了解他们困难，这下才打破了他们的麻痹自满思想，大家一致认识应首先调查贫雇生产有啥困难，马上解决，马上组织他们生产。现在正在进一步深入检查中。                （高孟、孟令）
