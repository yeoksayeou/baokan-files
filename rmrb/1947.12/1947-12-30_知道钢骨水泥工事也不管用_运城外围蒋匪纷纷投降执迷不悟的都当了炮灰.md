[This dispatch from the Jinan Front, 25th of this month] On the evening of the 19th, when the Jinan People's Liberation Army captured the "Flour Company" stronghold on the outskirts of Yuncheng, a squad from the 7th Company of the 369th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the enemy's 36th Division surrendered with their weapons and received preferential treatment. Squad Deputy Leader Bai Shuyun and soldiers Guo Hanxiao, Li Tingyu, and Cao Xianzong, a total of four people, surrendered because they had experienced the unprecedentedly fierce artillery fire and the brave and tenacious attacks of the People's Liberation Army. The enemy had completely lost confidence in their steel and concrete fortifications. Recounting their surrender, they said: "Our fortifications were made of steel and concrete, and general artillery shell tests couldn't penetrate them. But on the evening of the 19th, your firepower was truly terrifying! We don't know what kind of cannons you used, but they blew a large hole in the high building in one go, blew the high staircase apart, and wrecked a heavy machine gun. They also injured the squad leader under the building. The deafening sound made our heads spin and our ears ring, and the building shook as if it were about to collapse, which was truly frightening. We thought, although our superiors ordered our squad to 'hold firm,' who would want to hold on when the bombing was so fierce? Looking down, you had quickly crossed the barbed wire and outer trenches and surrounded the building. To save our lives, we thought it was better to surrender quickly. Otherwise, another shot would collapse the building, and we would be buried underneath like that heavy machine gun." In this destructive attack, many others also laid down their weapons and received preferential treatment; the stubborn enemies who clung to their errors became cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek.

　　知道钢骨水泥工事也不管用
  　运城外围蒋匪纷纷投降执迷不悟的都当了炮灰
    【本报晋南前线二十五日电】十九日黄昏，晋南人民解放军攻下运城外围据点“面粉公司”的时候，守敌三十六师一二三旅三六九团七连一个班，自动携械投降，受到优待。该班副班长白树云及战士郭汉小、李廷玉、曹献忠共四人，他们所以自动投降，因为尝到人民解放军空前猛烈的炮火和战士坚强勇猛的攻击，敌人对于钢骨水泥工事也完全丧失了信心。他们谈起投降的经过说：“我们工事是钢骨水泥，曾经过一般的炮弹试验打不进去，但是十九日那天晚上，你们的火力实在厉害！不知用的什么炮，一下子就把高楼炸开一个大洞，把高楼梯炸断，把一挺重机枪炸坏，又在房子底下把班长也炸伤。我们被那阵轰隆隆的响声震得头昏耳聋，楼房也震动得要塌的样子，实在使人害怕。我们想，上级虽然叫我们这一班人“坚守”，但是炸得这样厉害，谁还愿意去守呢？再看下边，你们已经很快飞过铁丝网外壕，把楼房包围。我们为了顾全性命，不如快点投降。不然的话，再来一炮，把楼房炸塌，我们就会象那挺重机枪一样埋在底下。”在这次摧毁性的攻击中，还有不少的自动放下武器，都受到优待；执迷不悟顽抗的敌人，则全部替蒋介石当了炮灰。
