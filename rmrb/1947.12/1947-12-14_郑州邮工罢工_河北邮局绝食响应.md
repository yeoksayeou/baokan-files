    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 11th: As the so-called "National Postal Workers' General Union," entirely manipulated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, convened its Fifth Pseudo-Representative Congress in Shanghai on the 9th, postal workers in the Chiang-controlled areas launched a large-scale wage increase strike. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 9th: All workers at the Zhengzhou Post Office, a vital transportation hub, have gone on strike. In Tianjin, 1,600 employees of the Hebei Postal Bureau called on all postal workers to hold a one-day hunger strike on the 8th in response, to support the Zhengzhou postal workers and to support the wage increase demands of all postal workers in the Chiang-controlled areas.
