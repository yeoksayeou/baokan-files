　　[This newspaper, Gaoyi News] This year has been plagued by a prolonged drought, and the county's harvest is less than 60% of normal. To compensate for the poor harvest, a campaign to organize all women in the county to engage in a hundred-day textile movement was proposed in October. In the past month or so, women in 67 villages across the county have been organized, with 8,246 women participating in group spinning. The organized villages account for over 66% of the county's administrative villages, and considerable achievements have already been made. In Beijiao, to successfully complete the textile work, the male laborers of the entire village spent two days digging six underground storage cellars for the women. Li Chunying, a model spinner, personally led a group of 12 people, insisting on spinning for three hours every night. In one month, her group alone spun 135 jin of thread. Women in Xiyitou organized collective spinning, sleeping only after twelve o'clock. When they felt sleepy while spinning, they sang songs to boost their spirits. Among the 220 women in Sunjiazhuang village, 193 have already been organized for collective spinning, forming 21 flower spinning groups and 7 weaving groups. In this month, in addition to doing housework and making cotton clothes, they spun 987 jin of thread, earning 700,800 yuan, and wove 128.8 zhang of cloth, earning 92,000 yuan. In this month alone, textile work earned 800,000 yuan, which, at current market prices, can buy 34.8 shi of grain (a large shi is equivalent to two market shi). The village summarized the textile work, and the women saw the actual benefits, further deepening their understanding of the importance of textile work. In Zhang Jing's group in Maliu village, five women wove 40 bolts of cloth and spun 60 liang of thread in 25 days, earning a net profit of 40,000 yuan after deducting consumption and raw materials. With the development of the hundred-day textile movement, many model cooperatives have also emerged to assist in textile production. Such as Sunjiazhuang, Xiguan, etc. After the women in Sunjiazhuang were organized, the entire village was short 41 spinning wheels. The cooperative quickly made 41 spinning wheels and lent them to the women's textile groups at prices lower than the market price. Currently, the textile wave is continuing to develop throughout the county. (Gaoyi United Office, Wen Yan, Jin Kui)

    【本报高邑讯】今年久旱，全县收成不足六成，为补歉收，在十月即提出了组织全县所有妇女开展百日纺织运动。一个多月来，全县已有六十七个村妇女组织起来，参加小组纺织的妇女为八二四六人，组织起来村庄占全县行政村的百分之六十六强，并且已经得到了相当的成绩。北焦为了胜利完成纺织，全村男劳力抽了两天给妇女们打地窨子六个。纺线模范李春英亲自领导了十二个人的一个组，每夜坚持纺线三个钟头，一个月光她一组即纺线一三五斤。西驿头妇女组织起来集体纺织，到十二点才睡觉，在纺线觉着磕睡时，即唱歌来振奋精神。孙家庄全村二百廿个妇女中，已经组织起来集体纺织的即有一九三人，二十一个纺花组，七个织布组，在这一月中，除作家中零活、棉衣外，纺线九八七斤，赚洋七十万零八千元，织布一百廿八．八丈，赚洋九万二千元。在这一月中，纺织即赚了八十万元，按现在市价即可买谷子三四．八石（大石一石折市石两石）。该村总结了纺织，妇女们看到了实际利益，更深刻认识了纺织的重要。马留村张景组，五个妇女二十五天织布四十匹，纺线六十两，除了消耗及原料，净赚洋四万元。在百日纺织运动开展下，也出现了不少的帮助纺织的模范合作社。如孙家庄、西关等，孙家庄在妇女组织起来后，全村短四十一辆纺车，合作社连忙赶制纺车四十一辆，低于市价贷给妇女纺织组。现在全县纺织潮正继续开展。（高邑联辨合公室、文彦、金魁）
