    [Reported by this newspaper, JiluYu, 17th] The masses of Chiping have started a wave of enlisting in the army to exterminate Chiang and avenge their grievances, starting from the expression of their suffering. At a conference of 15,000 activists in the county, after comrades Shen and Su of the county party committee gave inspiring reports on exterminating Chiang and avenging grievances, the activists from various districts launched enthusiastic discussions. In repeated deliberations, everyone recalled the deep blood debts created by Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen, Li Qishan and Feng Taiheng. The masses in the sixth district recounted that 28 people from Zaohe Yang Village were killed by Feng Taiheng. Remembering that Feng Taiheng is still in Dong'a city today, everyone said with hatred: "We must avenge the elders of Zaohe Yang Village! We must capture Chiang Kai-shek and Feng Taiheng alive!" Liu Changyi of Sanlizhuang also said excitedly: "I want to join the army! I want to capture Chiang Kai-shek, Li Qishan, and Feng Taiheng alive, eat their flesh, and drink their blood!" Amid the enthusiastic cries of registration, the elderly also said with emotion: "I will fetch water, plaster houses, and sweep the yards for you, ensuring that not an acre of land is left uncultivated." The women said: "We will make clothes and weave cloth for you, ensuring that your families will not be in difficulty. Go and capture old Chiang with peace of mind!" The fire of exterminating Chiang and avenging grievances burned in the hearts of everyone present. After a day of deliberation, more than 20 young people ran to the hero's stage to register for military service. Finally, the activists present all set out their work plans after returning to their villages, such as how to hand over the task of exterminating Chiang and avenging grievances to the masses for discussion, leading the masses to launch group discussions, family meetings, etc., and launching competitions between villages to see who is more voluntary, who has a better background, who is of the right age, and who supports the army better.

    群众自愿参军复仇
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】茌平群众从诉苦中掀起灭蒋复仇参军热潮。在全县一万五千个积极分子大会上，由县委申同志、苏同志相继作了灭蒋复仇的启发报告后，各区的积极分子们，便展开了热烈的讨论。在反复酝酿中，大家回忆起蒋介石爪牙李岐山、冯太恒造下的血海深仇。六区的群众诉到枣河杨庄被冯太恒一起杀死了廿八人，想起冯太恒如今还在东阿城里时，大家痛恨的说：“咱们要给枣河杨庄的父老报仇，非活捉蒋介石、活捉冯太恒不可！”三里庄刘长义也激奋的说：“我要参军，我要活捉蒋介石、活捉李岐山、冯太恒，吃他的肉，喝他的血！”在热烈报名的激奋声中，老年人也感动的说：“我给你们打水、泥屋、扫院子，保险不荒一亩地。”妇女们说：“俺给你做衣裳、织布，管叫你家不作难。你们放心去捉老蒋吧！”灭蒋复仇的热火，燃烧在每个到会人的心里，经过一天的酝酿，即有二十余名青年跑到英雄台上报名参军。最后，到会的积极分子们，均订出了自己回村后的工作计划，例如怎样把灭蒋复仇的任务交给群众讨论，领导群众展开小组酝酿、家庭会议等，并且展开村与村竞赛，看谁自愿、谁成份好，年龄合格，看谁拥军拥的好。
