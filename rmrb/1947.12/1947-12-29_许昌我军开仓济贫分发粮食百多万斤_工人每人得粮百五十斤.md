Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, December 27th: A frontline reporter reports on the situation of the people of Xuchang courageously distributing grain, stating: When the People's Liberation Army attacked Xuchang, impoverished people followed the People's Liberation Army to distribute grain. Wherever the gunfire stopped, they swarmed there to carry away the grain hoarded by the Chiang bandits. After the Chiang bandits were compressed to the southeast corner of the city, the urban poor rushed to the railway station, braving stray bullets to help the People's Liberation Army dismantle the railway, and divided all the Chiang bandit materials and food on a train. After the liberation of Xuchang City, the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government opened the Chiang bandit warehouses, distributing over a million jin of grain in six days. More than 3,000 households of railway workers, cart pullers, rickshaw pullers, and workers in various industries in the city each received 150 jin of grain. Teachers and students of provincial Xuchang Middle School, Simplified Normal School, and other primary and secondary schools, as well as civil charitable organizations such as the Ciyu (Nurturing Infants) Institute, the Yunsheng (Pregnant Women's) Institute, the Youyou (Orphan's) Institute, and merchants and citizens who were ravaged by the Chiang bandits and unable to maintain their livelihoods, also generally received grain. Statistics show that more than 60,000 people received relief. The masses also angrily destroyed the Chiang bandit's Second Special Commissioner's Office and the county government, and automatically divided the bulk of the UNRRA materials hidden in the "Three Youth League" house by the Chiang bandits under the guise of relief to aid the Chiang bandits. In addition, the People's Liberation Army also provided relief to more than 1,000 wounded soldiers abandoned by the Chiang bandits, and more than 200 lightly wounded soldiers have been sent back to their hometowns with funds.
