　　【Taihang News from This Newspaper】The Taihang District Branch of the Jinnan Bank conducted a preliminary inspection of loans in the Second District of Shexian County: The district had a total of 4.49 million yuan in old agricultural and sideline product loans. Except for a 100,000 yuan loan to a textile factory, the rest were all issued through sixteen cooperatives. Twelve of these cooperatives embezzled 2,452,500 yuan of loans, accounting for 54.6% of the total loan amount. The cooperatives that embezzled loans accounted for 75%. Most of these loans embezzled by the cooperatives were used for commercial purposes, such as buying peppers, tobacco, cotton, and sheep. Some cooperatives did not lend to the masses after obtaining loans from the bank; others used the money after recovering it from the masses. The twelve cooperatives included one district-level federation and two credit cooperatives. Regarding the methods of embezzlement: some deliberately set the interest rate too high, making the masses afraid to borrow, or used the excuse of lacking funds to passively respond to the masses. For example, Bai Quanshui set the interest rate at five or six percent, and the masses reflected, "What can we do with the loan (referring to production)! The profit earned is not enough to pay the interest!" When the masses in Nangou Village of that village went to the credit department to apply for loans, the cooperative said, "The funds are used for business, we don't have any funds!" The Futang Cooperative did not lend to the masses, and even said, "The masses didn't want to borrow at the time. If the cooperative doesn't use the money, it will have to pay interest for nothing!" After inspection, some, like Bai Quanshui, have already transferred the funds to poor and hired peasants for production, while others are still passively shirking responsibility and unwilling to actively transfer the funds to the masses. For example, the Futang Cooperative does not try to find funds for the masses to organize production, but tells the masses, "You can borrow money to buy cotton, but if you want to borrow money, you have to tell us three to five days in advance, because we don't have any funds." Even the Gaojiazhuang Cooperative embezzled all 150,000 yuan of loans for three months. When comrades from the county went to inspect, they even fabricated a roster, falsely naming 56 households, with each household receiving two to three thousand yuan; they also said, "We guarantee that they are all hired peasants." They also fooled the masses, telling them, "When the bank asks, just say you have borrowed the money!" A few cadres decided that no one should expose the truth. After an in-depth investigation of the hired and poor peasants, the entire deception was exposed, and they had no choice but to admit the deceptive facts. The above facts have attracted the attention of the leadership in the Second District of Shexian County. They have made a self-criticism at the district and village cadre expansion meeting, and decided that each village should establish a hired and poor peasant loan committee. Cooperatives that have embezzled loans should immediately return them, and all loans should be discussed by the hired and poor peasants and used for their benefit. Individual villages will also adjust loans among themselves based on the severity of the disaster in each village. The district branch also called on all localities to conduct a thorough inspection based on the above situation and conscientiously correct this bad phenomenon.

　　涉县二区合作社不顾群众生产
  　挪用贷款半数以上
    【本报太行讯】冀南银行太行区行对涉县二区贷款作了一个初步检查：全区共有农副业旧贷款四百四十九万元，除一个纺织厂贷款十万元外，其余全部通过十六个合作社发放，内有十二个合作社挪用贷款二百四十五万二千五百元，占全部贷款的百分之五十四·六。挪用贷款的合作社，占百分之七十五。合作社挪用的这些贷款，大部分作了商业用，如买花椒、烟叶、棉花和羊等。其中有的从银行贷上就没贷给群众；有的从群众手里收回来用了。十二个合作社中包括一个区联社和两个信用社。在挪用方式上：有的是故意把息定的太高，使群众不敢贷，或者借口没款，消极应付群众，如白泉水规定利息五、六分，群众反映说：“贷上款做个啥（指生产）吧！赚上还不够出利钱哩！”该村南沟群众到信用部贷款时，合作社说：“款营业上用啦，没款！”佛堂合作社没贷给群众，还说：“群众当时不贷，合作社如果不用了，还得白出利钱哩！”经检查后，现在有的如白泉水等已经转给贫雇生产，有的则还消极推诿，不愿积极转给群众，如佛堂合作社，不设法给群众弄款，组织他们生产，却给群众说：“你们要贷棉花可以，如果贷款，就得早三、五天告说，咱可是没款。”甚至象高家庄合作社，将全部贷款十五万元挪用了三个月，当县里同志去检查时，还假造名册，捏名五十六户，每户二、三千元；还说：“保证都是雇贫。”并愚弄群众，告群众说：“银行问时，就说贷着（款）哩！”少数干部议定：任何人不得暴露。后经深入雇贫调查，全部给他揭穿了，不得已才承认欺骗事实。以上事实，已引起涉县二区领导上的注意，在区村扩干会上作了检讨，并决定：各村成立雇贫贷款委员会，合作社挪用贷款，立即退出，一律经雇贫讨论，贷给雇贫使用，并按各村灾荒轻重，进行个别村与村的调剂。区行也根据以上情况，号召各地普遍进行检查，认真纠正这一坏现象。　　　　　　　（冀南银行太行区行办公室）
