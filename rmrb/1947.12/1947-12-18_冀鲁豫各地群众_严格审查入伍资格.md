The People in Hebei-Shandong-Henan Areas
Strictly Review Enlistment Qualifications
[Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 16th] The masses in various parts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are paying attention to reviewing those who are enlisting in the army, thoroughly purging landlord elements. After discussions among the masses in various villages in Nanle, they set their own review conditions for new soldiers, and those who do not meet the conditions are immediately purged. The review conditions in Wangluoji are: (1) Between 18 and 35 years old, no landlords or rich peasants; (2) No diseases. Those who enlist are first discussed by the小组(small group), then reviewed by the 大会(general meeting). Of the 58 people in the village who signed up to join the army, only 18 were qualified after repeated reviews by the masses three times. After the new soldiers from various villages gathered in the county, they reviewed each other by company, platoon, and squad. Some villages did not conduct thorough reviews, and landlord elements sneaked in, but they were purged after this in-depth verification. For example, Zhu Yinxiang, the target of struggle in the Fourth District, was repeatedly interrogated by everyone. When asked why he joined the army, he told the truth: "I joined the army to avenge my father, because Zhu Yuxiang, a cadre from the ×小区(small district), is also going to the front, and I am going to shoot him in the back." As a result, he was purged by everyone. A total of 5,440 people enlisted in the county, and 1,120 were screened out, leaving only 4,320 qualified. The masses in various villages in Puyang also paid attention to reviewing new soldiers. Forty-two students from Zhangyi Village signed up to join the army, but after strict review by the masses, only five were qualified. Dong'a proposed that enlisting should trust the masses' review, and new soldiers should also trust the masses. Farmers in the Seventh District set out "Three Wants and Five Don'ts," namely, 1. Want young and strong people, 2. Want good health, 3. Want conscious and voluntary; 1. Don't want landlords and rich peasants, 2. Don't want old people, 3. Don't want people in poor health, 4. Don't want people with mental illness, 5. Don't want people who are not conscious. These conditions are used for mutual competition among villages.

    冀鲁豫各地群众
    严格审查入伍资格
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】冀鲁豫各地群众，注意审查参军人，彻底清洗地主分子。南乐各村经群众讨论，自己定出新战士审核条件，不合条件者即行清洗。王落集审核条件是：（一）十八岁以上三十五岁以下，不要地主富农；（二）无疾病的，参军者先由小组讨论，大会审查，全村报名参军者五十八人，后经群众反复审查三次、结果只有十八名合格。各村新战士集合县后，又以连排班互相审查，有的村庄审查不彻底，被地主成份钻进来，但经这次深入查核，即被清洗出去。如四区斗争对象朱银祥经大家再三追审他，问他为什么参军时，结果他说了实话：“我参军是为父报仇，因为×小区干部朱玉祥也到前方，我准备打他的黑枪。”结果被大家清洗出去。计全县参军五千四百四十名，审查掉一千一百廿名，仅有四千三百二十名合格。濮阳各村群众亦注意审查新战士，张仪村有学生四十二人报名参军，但经群众严密审查，只有五名合格。东阿提出参军相信群众审查，新战士亦相信群众。七区农民自己定出“三要五不要”即一要青壮年，二要身体好，三要自觉自愿；一不要地主富农，二不要老的，三不要身体不好的，四不要有精神病的，五不要不自觉的。并以此为各村互相竞赛条件。
