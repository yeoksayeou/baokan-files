　　[Dispatch from This Newspaper's Jinan Bureau, 24th] In Dongzhuang Village, Qiu County, to mobilize women for textile mutual aid, male groups were first organized for discussions. Everyone said: "Organizing textile production will benefit the whole family." Group member Tao Jingqing suggested that his wife participate in the textile mutual aid, and everyone said: "Having the women at home spin and sell cloth to earn money is also a way to make a living," and everyone proposed to mobilize their family members to join the textile group. However, after returning home, the thinking of most women could not be unlocked. For example, the daughter-in-law of Guan Guixin said to Guan Gui: "Joining the group requires one work point a day, the same as the male group, so I won't join!" (Mainly afraid of not being allowed to visit her parents' home.) After Xing Mingli mobilized his grandmother, his grandmother said: "Everyone's hands are different!" (Afraid that others will spin bad yarn.) Only Wang Fengji, the woman from Zhang Xinan's family, was very active. She joined the group herself and also went to mobilize others. After these situations were reported to the mutual aid group, they discussed and studied together to dispel those concerns. For example, it was said: "Women's textile work is like our grain production. First, we produce enough for our own use, and then we sell the rest." Regarding the quality of the spun yarn, a method of calculating work points for textile work was proposed: (1) Six liang of spun yarn counts as one work point; winding yarn, netting tassels, sizing, and reeling one and a half jin of yarn all count as one work point; operating a reeling machine counts as one work point; and weaving one zhang of cloth counts as one work point. After the discussion, it was decided to go home and mobilize people individually, and a women's meeting was held to call for participation in mutual aid. As a result, only nine women, including Wang Fengji, Wang Fengxian, and Zhao Jianfeng, signed up to participate in textile production. They were determined to organize all thirty able-bodied women in the village to work together. Wang Fengji said: "We must spin and weave diligently, and distribute dividends, so that everyone can see the benefits of production." In less than three months, her group spun and wove fifteen bolts of cloth, and distributed dividends seven times. Each time dividends were distributed, a meeting of all thirty-odd women in the village was convened. Some group members also reported the benefits of participating in mutual aid. For example, Zhao Jianfeng said: "I can't weave cloth, but I can do odd jobs in the group and still get a share of the distribution." Wang Fengxian, who was eighty-two years old, said: "I can't spin or weave, but I can make tassels and still get money and cloth." In this way, other women saw the benefits with their own eyes. At the same time, Wang Fengji also compiled the benefits of mutual aid into a song and taught everyone to sing: "Mutual aid increases production, work is natural, dividends are distributed at any time, and it is not difficult to get cloth to wear!" It has now grown to twenty-three people. On November 1st, another general meeting of women was held to strive for the participation of all women in textile production this winter.

　　实际得利打通思想东庄发展纺织互助
    【本报冀南二十四日电】邱县东庄村发动妇女纺织互助，首先组织男组讨论，都说：“组织起来纺织全家都有好处。”组员陶景清提出，叫自己老婆参加纺织互助，大家都说：“叫家里纺个卖布赚个钱，也活便活便”，各人都提出要动员自己家人参加纺织组。但是回家后，多数妇女思想打不通，如关桂新娶的媳妇对关桂说：“参加组一天要一个工，给男组一样，那我不参加！”（主要怕不叫走娘家。）邢明立动员奶奶后，他奶奶说：“人的手头也不样！”（怕别人纺线坏）只有张新安家里女人王凤吉很积极，自己参加组，又要去动员别人。这些情形在互助组汇报后，共同讨论研究，打通了那些顾虑。如说：“妇女纺织跟咱打粮食一样，先够用的再说卖”，关于纺线好坏，提出了纺织计工办法：（一）纺线六两为一个工，拐线、网穗子、浆、络各一斤半线子算一个工，掏绑机为一工，织布一丈为一工。讨论好后，决定回家再个别动员，又开妇女大会，号召参加互助。结果只有王凤吉、王凤先、赵建凤等九个妇女报名参加了纺织。她们决心把全村三十个能纺妇都组织来起，王凤吉说：“咱要勤纺勤分布分红利，叫大家看出生产的好处来。”她组不足三个月，纺织了十五个布，共分了七次红，每次分红利时，都召集全村三十余个妇女开会，有些组员并报告参加互助好处，如赵建凤说：“我不会织布，在组里做零活，也能分布。”八十二岁的王凤先说：“我也不会纺，也不能织，只网穗子也能分钱分布。”这样，别的妇女亲眼看到了好处，同时王凤吉又把互助好处编成歌教大家唱：“互助多生产，作活又自然，随时分红利，穿布不作难！”现已发展到二十三人。在十一月一日，又开全体妇女会，争取今冬全部妇女参加纺织。
