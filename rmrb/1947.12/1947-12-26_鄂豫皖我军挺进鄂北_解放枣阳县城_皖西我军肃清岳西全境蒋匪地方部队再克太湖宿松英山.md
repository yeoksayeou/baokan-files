　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 24th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Zaoyang County Town in Northern Hubei on the 17th, with the defending enemy fleeing at the mere sight of our forces. On the same day, another unit of our army entered Tongbai County Town, shaking hands and celebrating victory with the Yu-Shaan-E PLA.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 24th: The entire territory of Yuexi in Western Anhui has been completely recovered by the Liberation Army. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit 25th Division, which invaded the county on the 7th, was continuously struck by the Liberation Army and the People's Guerrilla forces, and fled back to Huoshan in a sorry state on the 16th. Furthermore, on the 18th, local troops of the Western Anhui Military Region, near Hekousi, south of Huoshan, routed a part of the 20th Brigade of the division, killing over twenty enemy personnel including a deputy regimental commander.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan, 24th: Delayed news: Local troops of the Western Anhui and Eyu Military Regions are coordinating with the main forces to wipe out the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invading the liberated areas, in order to crush their so-called "mopping-up plan" against the Dabie Mountains. Western Anhui troops captured Taihu on the 7th and Susong on the 13th. Eyu troops captured Yingshan on the 10th. In the battle of Susong, 77 Chiang Kai-shek bandit youth soldiers were captured. Furthermore, another unit of local troops in Western Anhui, on the 13th, annihilated parts of the 51st Brigade of the 74th Division and the 1st Regiment of the Security Force of Chiang Kai-shek's forces at Zhongmei River, southeast of Huo County, totaling over 150 enemy personnel.
