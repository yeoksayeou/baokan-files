Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army captured Laiyang County seat at 11:30 PM on the 13th. The Chiang bandits, Chiang's security teams, and "Returning Home Corps" entrenched in the city, totaling over 10,000, were completely annihilated, with none escaping. The results of the battle are still being tallied. Previously, Laiyang was the political center of the Jiaodong Liberated Area, and it was invaded by Chiang's bandits on September 18th. After the People's Liberation Army captured the city, the vast inland areas of Jiaodong, with the exception of a narrow strip along the coast from Longkou and Yantai to Weihaiwei in the Bohai Sea, have returned to the hands of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 15th: Simultaneously with the recapture of Laiyang, another unit of the People's Liberation Army defeated eight enemy brigades reinforcing from the southwest of Laiyang, 30 to 40 li away, in the Dayetou and Shuitougou area. These brigades included the 156th Brigade and 159th Brigade of the Reorganized 64th Division, the 8th Brigade, 36th Brigade, and 198th Brigade of the Reorganized 54th Division, the 42nd Brigade of the Reorganized 8th Army (recently expanded from the Reorganized 8th Division), the 76th Brigade of the Reorganized 9th Division, and the 57th Brigade of the New 74th Division. In the fierce fighting from the 10th to the 13th, the People's Liberation Army killed, wounded, and captured over 3,000 Chiang bandits. The fighting is still raging fiercely in the area.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: Our guerrillas are active in and around Weihaiwei. At 9:00 AM on the 11th of this month, two platoons of our army ambushed Chiang bandits at the intersection in Weihaiwei and at the Dashiqiao (Big Stone Bridge) in the southeast corner of the city, killing ten and capturing nine alive. Our army has densely laid landmines around the city. From the 26th to the 29th of last month, Chiang bandits detonated several landmines on consecutive days, resulting in 14 deaths and injuries. On the 1st of this month, when Chiang bandits ventured out, they detonated another mine, killing three, and the remaining bandits fled in panic.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: Under the crushing blows of our army's victorious capture of cities and annihilation of the enemy along the Jiaoji Railway Line, the Chiang bandits are teetering on the brink of collapse. According to a soldier from the pseudo-Xu Zhenzhong's unit who escaped from Linzi Xindian: Eighty percent of Xu's unit are new recruits, most of whom lack cotton-padded clothing, and desertions are increasing daily. In Yidu, over forty men have already deserted from Zhang Tianyou's bandit troops in the Koubu district alone. The pseudo-county magistrate is frantically arresting civilians and forcing them to dig and repair fortifications in the streets and alleys, demanding a sack from each household to block the city gates and alleyways. The families of Chiang's pseudo-officials are fleeing to Jinan in large numbers. Soldiers are rushing to find "dry grandfathers" and "dry grandmothers" among the common people, asking them to find civilian clothes, preparing to desert the city at any time. On the evening of the 21st of last month, outside the north gate of the city, the enemy was alarmed by a pack of dogs fighting over a corpse, and they frantically shelled the surrounding areas.

    胶东广大内地重归人民之手
    我克莱阳歼匪万余
    击溃援敌八个旅歼其三千
    【新华社华东前线十五日电】解放军于十三日夜十一时半攻克莱阳县城，困踞该城蒋匪、蒋记保安团队及“还乡团”等共约万余名，悉数就歼，无一漏网，战果正清查中。按莱阳前为胶东解放区之政治中心，九月十八日为蒋匪所侵占。解放军攻克该城后，除龙口、烟台至威海卫北海沿岸狭长一线尚有匪伪盘踞外，广大胶东内地已重归人民之手。
    【新华社华东前线十五日电】与收复莱阳同时，解放军另部于莱阳西南三十至四十里之大野头、水头沟一线击溃北援敌八个旅，即整六四师之一五六旅、一五九旅，整五四师之八旅、三十六旅及一九八旅，整八军（最近由整八师扩编）之四二旅，整九师之七六旅，新七四师之五七旅等部。自十日迄十三日四天激战中，解放军共毙伤俘蒋匪三千余名。现战事仍在该地激烈进行中。
    【新华社华东十五日电】我游击队活跃威（海卫）市内外。本月十一日上午九时，我军两个排于威市内之十字路及城东南角之大石桥设伏，击毙出扰蒋匪十名，生俘九名。市周我密布地雷，上月二十六日至二十九日四天中，蒋匪连日踏响地雷多枚，死伤十四名。本月一日蒋匪出扰，又中雷炸死三名，余匪狼狈回窜。
    【新华社华东十五日电】胶济线蒋匪在我军到处克城歼敌节节胜利威震下，岌岌自危。据自临淄辛店逃出之伪徐振中部士兵谈：徐部新兵占百分之八十，大多数身无棉衣，逃跑日众。益都伪匪张天佑等部，仅口埠一个区即已逃跑四十多名。该县伪县长即仓惶抓捕市民在街巷挖修工事，每户索麻袋一条，堵塞城门巷口。蒋伪官员眷属则大批逃向济南。士兵纷纷找老百姓拜干爷、干娘，托找便衣，预备随时弃城逃窜。上月二十一日晚城北门外，因众狗争食一个死尸，全城敌大惊，忙向四郊发炮。（附图片）
