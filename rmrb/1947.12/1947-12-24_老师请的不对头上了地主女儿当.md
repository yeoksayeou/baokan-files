　　Hired the Wrong Teacher, Got Tricked by the Landlord's Daughter
　　[This report from Changzhi] In Sweet Water Lane, Lower East Street, Changzhi, Li Guizhen, the landlord's daughter, appeared very active when textile mobilization began. The leadership made her the textile team leader. In the beginning, eight people bought a machine together and used rice to hire a teacher, but only she learned to weave. Pin-employment woman Chang Cui then asked to learn the craft, but she wouldn't let her use the machine, saying that the team leader should learn first, and then everyone else. As a result, she learned the technique but didn't teach everyone. Wang Guoze was a member of her team. She had just started learning to weave and didn't know how to connect the threads. When asked to help her connect them, she didn't say a word for a long time, and even put on the airs of a landlord, making the poor and hired women beg her. Later, she connected them haphazardly, deliberately ruining the connection, making it impossible to weave a whole machine of cloth. At this meeting, everyone loudly proclaimed: "We must learn the technique ourselves, we cannot let the landlord's daughter learn it, we also want to be team leaders, all power to be grasped by the poor and hired!"

　　老师请的不对头上了地主女儿当
    【本报长治讯】长治下东街甜水巷，地主女儿李桂珍，在开始动员纺织时，表现很积极，领导上就让她当纺织组长，开始八人伙买了一架机，大家拿米请的老师，只她一个人学织，贫雇妇女常翠则提出想学学手。她就不让上机，说是先组长学会大家再学。结果她学会了技术，不教大家了。王果则是她组一个组员，才开始学织布，不会接线头，叫她给接接吧，她就半天不吭声，还抖地主架子，叫贫雇妇女求告她，后来乱接了接，故意给接坏了，闹的一机布不能织。这次会议上，大家很响亮的提出：“技术要自己学，地主女儿学不得，组长我们也要当，一切权力贫雇掌。”
