Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 19th: A unit of the Lunan Main Force Corps, after December 12th, captured Bianqiao Town east of Sishui City on the Lin (Yi) Zi (Yang) Highway in one fell swoop, completely annihilating two companies of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Shandong Security 2nd Brigade under He Zhibin, one squadron of the pseudo-Sishui County Brigade, and the pseudo-district and township offices. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 310 enemy soldiers below the rank of company commander were captured, and 64 enemy soldiers, including the police station chief and below, were killed or wounded. Three light machine guns, 180 rifles and pistols, and other materials were seized, creating a model example of the Lunan Main Force Corps in siege warfare.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 19th: The military and civilians in eastern Fei (County), Lunan, crushed the grain-grabbing plan of the stubborn bandit Wang Hongjiu and his troops. In the past month, the local armed forces and emancipated peasants in the county, adhering to the border areas, repelled three invasions of grain grabbing by stubborn bandits of 300 to 1,500 people, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 60 enemies, and repeatedly打击打夜出抢米之小股顽匪. At the end of last month, one of our units楔入深入顽匪腹地临(沂)西平原, successively captured strongholds such as Jiangshang, Zhubao, and Zhifang, killing and capturing 37 enemies, forcing the enemy to retreat across the board and curl up in the triangular area of ​​less than 30 miles on the Lin (Yi) Zi (Yang) and Lin (Yi) Zao (Zhuang) roads. At the same time, we took advantage of the victory to launch a "Save the Dying Movement" to massively disintegrate the bandit pseudo-"Returning Home Corps". In Fei County, three districts alone have surrendered to us with more than 120 people. The original Gu Kou pseudo Bao Gong has more than 30 people, now there are only five Bao heads left.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, December 19th: On the 10th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 83rd Division 188th Regiment and one battalion of the 19th Brigade, divided into three routes from Rizhao and Shijiusuo, invaded the Liangcheng (50 miles north of Rizhao) and Baishishan (10 miles southeast of Rizhao City) areas. Our local unit immediately launched a counterattack. From 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM, the enemy was completely defeated, killing and wounding more than 260 enemy soldiers below the company commander, and capturing 95 enemy soldiers below the platoon leader. One artillery vehicle, two 60 mortars, and 15 light and heavy machine guns were seized.
