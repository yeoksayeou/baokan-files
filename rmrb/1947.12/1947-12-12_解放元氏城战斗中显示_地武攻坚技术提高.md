    Improved Local Armed Forces' Siege Technology Demonstrated in the Battle to Liberate Yuanshi City
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 10th dispatch] In the battle to liberate Yuanshi City, coordinated by a certain unit of the Taihang Local Armed Forces and the Jin-Cha-Ji troops, the siege technology and the organization and allocation of firepower showed an unprecedented improvement, and the number of enemy weapons captured was extremely large. On the 22nd of last month, at 4:00 PM, this unit rapidly crossed a trench more than two zhang wide in 40 minutes and completely occupied the West Gate. On the 2nd of this month, at 3:00 PM, when our forces launched a general offensive against Yuanshi City, the engineering corps of this unit, under the cover of intensive firepower, blew open a breach approximately 30-40 meters wide in the northwest city wall. The assault troops immediately rushed into the city and then developed the advance in depth. The battle ended at 5:00 AM on the 3rd. In addition to the gains of the Jin-Cha-Ji troops, this unit killed and wounded more than 200 Wei bandits, captured alive the Yuanshi puppet county magistrate Zhang Xi'an, battalion commander Zhu Wenhua, and 659 people below the rank of deputy battalion commander, seizing 10 light machine guns, 666 rifles, 1 light machine gun, 4 grenade launchers, 64 various pistols, and more than 39,000 rounds of various types of ammunition.
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] The process of the liberation of Yuanshi is as follows: After the People's Liberation Army liberated Shizhuang on the 12th of last month, the Taihang Jixi Local Armed Forces and a certain unit of central Hebei advanced to the vicinity of Yuanshi City on the 17th. On the 19th, they destroyed the enemy's protruding mother-and-child bunker complex outside the East Gate. At 16:20 on the 22nd, the first general offensive on the city gates was launched. Our troops on the south immediately crossed the trench and entered the gate. On the 23rd, after the enemy's last counterattack by more than 600 people failed, they set fire to the east, south, and west gates in succession at dusk and fled into the city. All three gates (the county does not have a north gate) were immediately brought under the control of our People's Liberation Army, and the first line of the bandits' strong fortifications was thus dissolved.
    After eight days of siege preparations, everything was ready at about 3:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, and a second general offensive was launched against the Wei bandits defending Yuanshi City, which was notoriously regarded as an impregnable copper wall. The first thick smoke column mixed with yellow earth appeared on the east gate, shooting straight into the sky. Five smoke columns on the west and south walls followed in succession, and the sound of guns and cannons shook the heavens and the earth, with smoke and fire soaring into the sky, enveloping the entire city. Our troops immediately occupied the breach at the East Gate. At the West and South Gates, our troops rushed into the city and controlled the breaches within five minutes. When the soldiers and civilians in the nearby villages on the outskirts of the city saw the houses and trees inside the city from the breach, and could vaguely see our troops leaping and advancing into the city with incredible speed, they cheered and applauded. After entering the city, one part of our troops on the west road went straight to West Street, while another part advanced south along the city wall. After entering the city, another part of our troops on the south road developed towards the southwest corner and eliminated a part of the enemy; another part attacked westward along the city wall, and a large follow-up force continued to advance northward. By 11:00 PM, the main force on the south road had completely wiped out the enemy west and south of the pagoda in the southwest corner of the city, and then developed towards the southeast corner of the city and South Main Street. At the same time, our troops on the west road also eliminated the enemy on the south side of the west city, and joined forces with our troops attacking west from the south city. At midnight, the enemy in the gate towers of the west and south gates were wiped out by our external demolition, and the city walls from the west gate to the south gate were brought under our control. At this time, the enemy's morale declined further, and they became even more demoralized, abandoning their armor and weapons and being captured in groups. A stubborn part of the enemy saw that the situation was unfavorable and attempted to flee northwestward from the north city, but were encircled and annihilated by our troops. Another group of enemies in the northeast corner, led by the traitor Wei himself, attempted to flee north, but after a fierce battle, the traitor Wei was killed, most of them were annihilated, and more than 300 were captured. Flames danced throughout the night, and shouts never ceased. At 6:00 AM on the 3rd, the battle ended victoriously in the smoke and fog of the fire set by the enemy, and the entire city was liberated.
    Yuanshi is located 90 li south of Shizhuang, and two-thirds of the eastern region of the county is a plain with abundant cotton production. Since the fall of the county to the Japanese invaders in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the people have suffered unprecedented disasters. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the traitorous puppet army of the city, Wei Yonghe, was appointed by the Chiang bandits as a "vanguard army", intensifying their control and exploitation and slaughter of the people. Under the personal direction of Wei, he successively created several shocking bloody tragedies, including the Nanzo massacre on December 29th of the 45th year, the Sucun massacre on July 18th of the 46th year, and the Dongzheng Sucun massacre on May 14th of this year. Countless people were victimized. However, the unyielding people of Yuanshi have always persevered in a desperate struggle against the enemy and puppets, using tunnels, sniper fire, and guerrilla warfare to coordinate with the activities of the local armed forces, and finally won the final victory. More than 140,000 people have begun to breathe the air of freedom and democracy. (Chun Yi)

    解放元氏城战斗中显示
    地武攻坚技术提高
    【本报太行十日电】太行地方武装某部在配合晋察冀部队解放元氏城之战斗中，攻坚技术与火力组织配备均表现了空前提高，缴获极大。该部上月廿二日下午四时以四十分钟时间，迅速越过了两丈余宽深的壕沟，全部占领西关。本月二日下午三时我向元氏城发动总攻时，该部工兵在密集火力掩护下，将西北城墙炸开约三四十米宽的缺口，突击部队立即冲入城内，随即纵深发展。战斗于三日五时结束。除晋察冀部队斩获外，该部毙伤魏匪二百余，生俘元氏伪县长张锡安、营长朱文华及副营长以下六百五十九人，缴获轻机枪十挺，步枪六百六十六枝，手提机枪一挺，掷弹筒四个，各种手枪六十四枝，各种子弹三万九千多发。
    【本报特讯】元氏解放经过如下：上月十二日解放军解放石庄后，太行冀西地方武装与冀中某部于十七日进抵元氏城近郊，十九日摧毁敌在东关外突出之子母堡垒群，二十二日十六时二十分发起首次对城关的总攻，南面我军当即越沟进关，二十三日敌最后一次六百多人反扑失败后，于黄昏时分在东、南、西三关先后纵火后遁入城内，三关（该县没北关）当即全部为我解放军控制，匪第一道强固防御工事即告解体。
    经过八天的攻城准备工作，本月二日午后三时许一切就绪，乃对守城魏匪素称铜墙铁壁坚不可破的元氏城发起再次总攻，在东门上出现了第一个浓烟卷着黄土的烟土巨柱，直冲云霄，西、南城五个烟柱亦随之继起，枪炮声震撼天地，烟火冲天，笼罩全城。东门我军当即占领缺口，西、南城我军五分钟内就突进城内控制了缺口。城郊近村军民从缺口望见城内房屋、树木，并隐约可见我军跳跃神速进城的姿态时，都欢呼鼓掌。西路我军进城后，一部直扑西街，另部顺城墙南进。南路另部我军进城后，一部向西南角发展，当解决敌一部；一部沿城垣西攻，后继大军续向北进。至十一时，南路大军将城西南方宝塔以西以南守敌全部肃清，乃向城东南角及南大街发展。同时西路我军又解决了西城南边之敌，在此与南城上西攻我军会合。午夜时分，西、南两城门楼之敌被我以外部爆破歼灭后，西门至南门城垣即为我控制。此时，敌士气愈下，更趋瓦解，丢盔卸甲，成群被俘。顽敌一部见大势不妙，逐图从北城向西北方逃窜，当为我军围歼。东北角另部敌人由魏逆亲率图向北逃窜，经激战后魏逆被击毙，大部被歼，俘三百余名。彻夜火光飞舞，喊声不绝，至三日晨六时在敌人所放大火的烟雾中战斗胜利结束，全城为我解放。
    元氏位于石庄南九十里，全县三分之二的东部地区为平原，棉产甚丰。自民国二十六年秋天沦陷日寇后，人民即遭到空前灾难。日寇投降后，该城汉奸伪军魏逆永和被蒋匪委为“先遣军”，变本加厉，继续统治压榨屠杀人民，在魏匪亲手主持下先后曾制造了四五年十二月二十九日的南佐、四六年七月十八日的苏村及今年五月十四日的东正苏村数次惊人血腥惨案，被害人民无数。但不屈服的元氏人民始终不懈的与敌伪坚持殊死的斗争，以地道、冷枪、游击战配合地方武装活动，终于获得最后胜利，十四万余人民开始得以呼吸自由民主的空气了。（纯一）
