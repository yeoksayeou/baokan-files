Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 4th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the second session of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 16th and lasted for two and a half months, officially concluded on November 30th. This session of the General Assembly "became a duel arena for the principled struggle between the supporters and opponents of democratic cooperation" (TASS). Throughout the meeting, representatives from the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries waged an unyielding struggle to defend peace, security, and democracy, exposing the ugly faces of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, and achieving a series of political and moral victories. This was reflected in the opposition to the Franco regime and the rejection of the admission of anti-democratic countries such as Ireland and Portugal into the United Nations, the insistence on the principle of unanimity among the great powers, and especially in the exposure and opposition to war propaganda and war-mongering by the United States, Britain, and other countries, which was the greatest achievement of this session of the General Assembly. The conference also thoroughly exposed the vicious conspiracies of the American reactionaries and their followers, Britain, France, Argentina, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representatives. Although the United States and Britain, exploiting their majority control, passed a number of illegal resolutions, such as establishing the "Special Committee on the Balkans," the "Temporary Commission on Korea," and the "Interim Committee of the General Assembly," this only exposed their conspiracies to betray the United Nations Charter, undermine international cooperation, and strangle the sovereignty of other countries, leading to their disastrous moral and political defeat. The central conspiracy of the United States in this session of the General Assembly was to abolish the principle of unanimity among the great powers, thereby turning the United Nations into a tool for its anti-democratic forces and its unbridled expansion and quest for world hegemony. However, the imperialist bloc did not even succeed in discussing this issue in the General Assembly, and the illegal "Interim Committee," having been rejected by the Soviet Union and other countries, could not make any binding decisions. Therefore, while the American reactionaries praised their "achievements" in undermining the Charter, they also complained that "the firm veto power stipulated in the Charter cannot be abolished by any majority." (New York Times, December 1st commentary). This is why Dulles openly expressed his betrayal of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. In commenting on this session of the General Assembly, a diplomatic observer from Pravda emphatically stated: "This meeting did not bring victory to those countries that attempted to turn the United Nations into a tool for their world domination, but brought disappointment. It helped expose the enemies of peace and democracy." He also emphasized: "The Soviet Union won a moral and political victory at the General Assembly and emerged as a resolute defender of peace and democracy." The observer revealed that the dangerous tendency in American foreign policy had become more obvious and warned the United States: "The meeting has shown the American reactionaries that they cannot destroy the United Nations organization. The meeting has also shown them the unity of all democratic forces and their perseverance and determination in the struggle for peace, which will undoubtedly nullify all the plans and intentions of the enemies of peace and democracy."

　　二届联合国大会闭幕
    苏联赢得政治胜利
  　美英丑恶面貌已遭揭穿
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合报导：于九月十六日开始的第二届联合国大会，历时两个半月，已于十一月三十日宣告闭幕。本届联大“成了民主合作的拥护者和反对者之间原则性斗争的决斗场”（塔斯社），在整个会议中，苏联与新民主国家的代表，为了保卫和平安全与民主，曾进行了不屈不挠的斗争，揭发了以美国为首的帝国主义集团的丑恶面貌，取得了一连串政治与道义上的胜利。这表现在：反对佛朗哥政权和拒绝接受爱、葡这样反民主国家之加入联合国，坚持大国的一致原则，尤其表现在为本届联大最大成就的揭露和反对美英等国的战争宣传和战争贩子上。会议也彻底暴露了美国反动派及其附和者英、法、阿根廷及蒋贼代表恶毒的诡计。美英利用多数的操纵，虽通过了若干非法议案，如设立“巴尔干特别委员会”、“朝鲜临时委员会”及“大会临时委员会”等，但这只是暴露了它们背叛联合国宪章、破坏国际合作与绞杀别国主权的阴谋，使它们在道义上政治上遭到惨败。美国在本届联大上的中心阴谋，是要废除大国一致原则，从而变联合国机构为其反对民主势力和肆行扩张与称霸世界的工具。但是帝国主义集团甚至没有达到在大会上讨论这一问题，而非法的“临时委员会”既为苏联等国所拒绝参加，就不能做出任何约束性的决定，因此美国反动派一面歌颂自己破坏宪章的“成就”，一面却埋怨“宪章中所规定的强固否决权不能以任何多数来废除”。（纽约时报一日评论）这就是为什么杜勒斯要公开表示背叛雅尔塔、波茨顿协定的原因。真理报外交观察家在评本届联大时力称：“这次会议对于那些企图变联合国为其统治世界工具的国家，并没有带来胜利，却带来了失望。它帮助揭发了和平与民主的敌人。”并着重指出：“苏联在大会上赢得了道义上和政治上的胜利，并且显现为和平与民主的坚决维护者。”观察家揭发美国外交政策中的危险倾向已变得更为明显，并警告美国说：“会议已向美国反动派显示，他们不能够毁灭联合国机构。会议也向他们显示了一切民主力量的团结及在为和平而斗争中的毅力和坚决，无疑的将使和平和民主的敌人的一切计划和打算归于无效”
