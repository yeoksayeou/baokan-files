Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th. The Political Department of the Liaodong Military Region of the Democratic Allied Forces summarized the initial experiences in carrying out the battle evaluation movement as follows: (1) At the beginning of the movement, the troops generally had the mindset of "the same old routine" and "no opinions." Soldiers were afraid of being retaliated against and dared not criticize their superiors. Some cadres were also afraid of criticizing their own shortcomings and damaging their prestige. Therefore, during the preparation stage, emphasis should be placed on explaining and evaluating tactics and command, which can reduce casualties. Commanders should first humbly examine their shortcomings and accept criticism from soldiers. This can not only eliminate grievances from subordinates and improve their own military skills, but also enhance their prestige. (2) In addition to the various centers, comparisons, and internships, the evaluation methods can also include staged evaluations, that is, dividing the combat process of the unit into several stages for gradual evaluation. For example, when a certain company evaluates a combat operation, it is divided into three stages: attacking the mountain, breaking through the enemy's front line, and attacking bunkers in the village. This evaluation method is relatively comprehensive, but the disadvantage is that it is not easy to be detailed. All kinds of evaluation methods cannot be completely separated, and should be appropriately selected according to the actual situation of the troops. In the evaluation, various methods are often used in conjunction, and the leadership should guide the movement to a certain focus to an appropriate extent. (3) Summaries should be made immediately. For example, if soldiers have many opinions on cadres, a serious self-criticism should be made during the summary, and responsibilities should not be shirked or shortcomings concealed. (4) Leadership of the battle evaluation movement. First, the focus should be on evaluating command. The complacency and unease of some cadres should be well corrected, so that cadres can attach importance to learning from the masses ideologically. This is the key to launching the battle evaluation movement. Second, when evaluating casualties, some companies have another wrong idea, that is, avoidable casualties are considered dishonorable. In this regard, the evaluation should focus on positive aspects such as evaluating tactics, avoiding serious casualties, and giving sufficient consideration to the glorious significance of existing casualties. Third, it is important to grasp the spirit of thinking of solutions in a positive direction, rather than passively reviewing the past. Therefore, "thinking of solutions" should be implemented in every evaluation, with timely summaries and comprehensive summaries. Fourth, battle evaluation should be closely integrated with other tasks, especially commendation and improving tactics. Military and political cadres should cooperate closely to integrate battle evaluation into a movement. Only in this way can the battle evaluation movement be led successfully.

    辽东战评运动初步经验：
    干部重视向群众学习是展开战评运动关键
    【新华社东北十五日电】民主联军辽东军区政治部总结开展战评运动的初步经验如下：（一）运动开始时，部队普遍存在着“老一套”、“没意见”的思想，战士害怕遭到报复，不敢批评上级，某些干部也怕批评自己的缺点，损害威信，因此在酝酿阶段时应着重解释评论战术与指挥，可以减少伤亡，指挥员首先要虚心检讨缺点，接受战士的批评，既可消除下级的埋怨，提高自己的军事素养，也就会提高威信。（二）评的方式，除各个中心、对比、实习等以外，还可实行阶段评，即把本单位作战过程划成几个阶段逐步评论。如某连评论一次作战时，分为三个阶段：攻山、突破敌人前沿、村落内攻地堡。这种评法比较全面，但缺点是不容易细致。所有各种评法不能截然分开，应根据部队的实际情况，适当选择。在评论中往往各种方法都会联系运用，领导上应在适当程度把运动引导到一定的重点。（三）应即时进行总结，如战士对干部的意见很多，总结时即应作严肃的自我检讨，不应推脱责任，掩过饰非。（四）战评运动的领导。第一，应掌握评指挥为主，对某些干部的自满情绪与不安心现象，应予很好纠正，使干部从思想上重视向群众学习，这是开展战评运动的关键。第二，在评论伤亡时，某些连队产生另一种错误的思想，即对于可以避免的伤亡认为是不光荣的。对此应在评论时着眼于评战术等积极方面，避免严重伤亡，对于已有伤亡的光荣意义，也应给以足够的估计。第三，要掌握向积极方面想办法的精神，而不是消极的检讨过去。所以“想办法”应贯彻在每一项评论中，随时的总结，全面的总结。第四，应很好的把战评和其他的工作特别是立功和提高战术等密切结合起来。军政干部应密切配合，把战评工作合成一个运动，只有如此才能把战评运动领导成功。
