　　German Workers, Peasants Mass
  　Resolutely Oppose the Division of Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] Berlin dispatch: The German people are loudly opposing the US-British imperialist conspiracy to divide Germany. Walter Ulbricht, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, announced that the German People's Congress would be convened on December 6th and 7th to elect a delegation to represent Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Ulbricht requested that the Foreign Ministers' Conference listen to the opinions of the German people. In the past few weeks, public gatherings and worker-peasant conferences have been held in the Soviet occupation zone, passing 164 resolutions demanding a national referendum on the issue of forming a unified Germany. Eight hundred representatives of anti-fascist parties resolved to demand that the Foreign Ministers' Conference implement the Potsdam Conference resolution on establishing a central German administrative body. The chairmen of trade unions and industrial committees in Leipzig also held a meeting, firmly opposing any attempt to divide Germany, and demanding that the Foreign Ministers' Conference use a national referendum to decide their future national system.
