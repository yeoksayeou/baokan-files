Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: The Zhejiang people's armed forces are growing stronger day by day and now exist throughout the province. According to a Zhejiang communication in the "Time and Literature" magazine, volume two, issue five, published in Shanghai: The Zhejiang people's armed forces are roughly divided into five areas of activity: (1) The Siming Mountain area in eastern Zhejiang: including Shangyu, Shengxian, Xinchang, Ningbo, Cixi and other counties. The headquarters are located in the Siming Mountains, with more than a thousand people. Under the leadership of Li Zhiguang, they have repeatedly crushed the "suppression" efforts of the Chiang bandits' Siming Mountain "Suppression Command," which led the "Zhejiang Security First Regiment," and established the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office to implement various democratic measures. In Dinghai Town, east of this mountainous area and near the sea, there are also Xu Xiaoli's people's armed forces active. Since the defection of Wei Yilu, the deputy captain of the Chiang bandits' Dinghai Police First Squadron stationed in Shenjiamen, and sixteen others to join this unit in July, its momentum has grown even greater, and its area of activity has expanded to include Fenghua and other counties, the hometown of the Chiang bandit. In addition, there are also naval people's armed forces active in the Xiangshan and Sanmen Bay sea areas. (2) The Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangsu border area: including Deqing, Anji, Xiaofeng, Changhua, Tongxiang, Changxing, Wuxing, Yuqian, Lin'an and other counties, with Tianmu Mountain as its base. On the Zhejiang-Anhui border, there is also a detachment of the Ning (Guo) Guang (De) Xiao (Feng) Guerrilla Independent Column led by Xu Daozhen. (3) The Zhejiang-Fujian-Jiangxi border area: From Jiangshan and Changshan north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, southeast through Qingyuan and Taishun in southern Zhejiang, all the way to the Chongshan Mountains of Pingyang on the east coast, are controlled by the people's armed forces, with a large number of people. Among them, Zheng Danfu's unit is the most famous. (4) The Jinhua-Lanxi Basin: The people's armed forces have more than a thousand people, and their activities cover Yiwu, Pujiang, Jiande and other counties, connecting to the Kuaiji Mountain area in the east. This unit once surrounded Quzhou, a key town on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway controlled by the Chiang bandits, which shocked the Chiang bandits throughout the province. (5) The Kuaiji Mountain area: is the People's Anti-Chiang Guerrilla Team led by Zhou Zhishan, active in Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Zhuji and surrounding areas. In addition to the above five major areas, there are also people's armed forces active in Kuocang Mountain in central Zhejiang and Yandang Mountain in southern Zhejiang. The communication stated: The people's armed forces in various parts of Zhejiang not only actively attack the Chiang bandits, seize weapons from bandit townships and villages to strengthen themselves, but also extensively carry out mass movements, organize propaganda teams, and establish salt militia teams in the salt-producing areas around Yuyao, and designated the thirteenth day of the second lunar month as Salt Workers' Emancipation Day. At present, in the areas controlled by the people's armed forces, a fervent mass emancipation movement has been launched.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Hangzhou on the 8th, the people's armed forces in the Jinhua area of Zhejiang have recently launched continuous attacks along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, disrupting the Chiang bandits' civil war transportation. On the 28th of last month, a large number of people's armed forces strafed Chiang bandit military vehicles with machine guns. The Chiang bandits were panicked and have been forced to deploy troops to the vicinity of Jinhua for defense.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, December 9th: According to a Shanghai newspaper, the people's armed forces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have recently launched a fierce campaign to seize the armed forces of the Chiang bandits' district and township regimes. On October 23rd, three members of the people's armed forces in Nantian District, Sanmen County, eastern Zhejiang, suddenly came disguised as local villagers and reported that "bandits" had been discovered somewhere. The Chiang district office was panic-stricken and urgently ordered the security police team to go to their aid. The people's armed forces, who had been lying in ambush around the district office, waited for the police to go far away and then bravely rushed into the district office, seizing two Thompson submachine guns, one light machine gun, and more than ten rifles. Dai Jia'en, the district chief of the district, attempted to draw his gun to resist but was shot dead by the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces then took advantage of the victory to attack the nearby Sidu Township Office, killing the deputy commander of the Chiang bandit township team and seizing more than ten rifles. Later, they raided the home of Chen Rong, the former escort captain of the Chiang bandits, and seized more than ten rifles and five pistols. On the night of the 26th of the same month, the people's armed forces in Wujin (Changzhou), southern Jiangsu, also broke into the home of Peng Xigeng, the chief of Yunlin Bao in the Eighth District, seized a semi-automatic pistol, captured Xu Yusheng, a member of the Chiang "self-defense team," and delivered a speech on the spot to the masses, explaining the position of the people's armed forces. That same night, in several villages such as Qianjiashe in Xuejiatang, Seventh District, west of the canal, four of the most heinous local tyrants were executed by the people's armed forces.
