Compost Pits, Accumulate More Wastewater, More Bedding, Sweep Streets
Zizhen Studies Manure Accumulation Methods

[This Newspaper, Licheng News] In the winter manure accumulation campaign, the Shangjie team of Zizhen Village felt that there was a lack of manure, mainly because the livestock were transporting goods, and there was no time to collect manure. Wood ash could be sold for five yuan per catty, and people were unwilling to use it as fertilizer... In order to achieve the plan of applying thirty loads of fertilizer per mu next year, the slogan "Fertilizer First Before Spring Arrives and Land is Planted" was put forward. Based on the actual situation of the village, four manure accumulation methods were studied:

I. Dig compost pits. Dig soil pits three feet deep and two feet wide at the door or in the yard. Sweep the debris from sweeping the streets and yards every day into it, and often pour sewage into the pits. After accumulating two-thirds of the depth, take it out. After being composted black, cover it with soil, which is better than [symbol not translated] manure. Second, every household prepares sewage tanks to accumulate more sewage. Third, use more bedding. Pad the animal pens once every two days, overcoming the past idea of not accumulating fertilizer when the bedding is wet. More bedding keeps the livestock healthy and reduces disease, and more manure can be accumulated. Fourth, sweep the streets. Sweep the firewood and soil on the street into one place, irrigate it with [symbol not translated] several times, and cover it with soil. After such a plan, all 52 households in the team now have 45 sewage tanks and 8 compost pits. It was decided that women and children would sweep the streets at night, and everyone was very enthusiastic. Some people have already started digging fertilizer pits, and everyone is actively launching the winter manure accumulation campaign. (Wang Duanqi, Zizhen Correspondence Group)

　　沤坑肥·积污水多垫圈·扫街道
    子镇研究积肥办法
    【本报黎城讯】子镇村上街队，在冬季积肥运动中，大家感到粪土缺乏，主要是牲口在运输，拾肥没有工夫，柴灰每斤能卖五元，不愿当肥……。为达到明年每亩上三十驮肥的计划，提出口号是：“春未到地未种肥料先行，”即根据该村实况，研究了四种积肥办法：
    一、刨沤肥坑，在门口或院内刨三尺深二尺宽的土坑，将每天扫街扫院的杂物扫进去，污水常倒坑内，每积三分之二深挑出来，沤的黑黑的，用土压住，赛过＠粪。二、家家准备污水缸，多积污水。三、多垫圈，每两天垫一次，克服已往垫湿不积肥的思想，多垫牲口卫生不生病，粪土能多积。四、扫街道。把街上的柴土扫在一处，用＠灌几次，用土盖住。经过这样计划，全队五十二户，现有污水缸四十五个，沤肥坑八个，决定妇女儿童晚上扫街道，大家劲头很大，现已有人挑肥坑，大家积极展开了冬季积肥运动。（王端奇、子镇通讯组）
