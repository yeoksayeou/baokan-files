Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 15th. The Jidong local armed forces, in coordination with local militias, have once again launched a large-scale attack on the Beining Railway, recapturing Leting County and several important stations. On the evening of the 9th, one of our local armed forces, in coordination with over two thousand militiamen from Fengrun and Ninghe, entered the area between Tianzhuang and Zhaojixizhuang, seventy li southwest of Tangshan, and completely destroyed six li of railway. Another unit advanced to the Luanxian and Changli sections on the evening of the 10th, echoing the military and civilians on the Tianzhuang line from east to west, successively capturing Zhugezhuang, Shimen, Anshan and other stations, annihilating a part of the Eighth Detachment of Chiang Kai-shek's transportation police, destroying twelve li of railway, and demolishing eighteen station buildings, bunkers, and pillboxes. On the 11th, our forces on the Tianzhuang line also repelled approximately three companies of the enemy's 62nd Army and over 300 transportation police officers and soldiers from the Fifth Detachment, who scurried south from Hetou (twenty li southwest of Tangshan) and Guye, killing and wounding over a hundred enemy soldiers and capturing sixty-five alive. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in Leting, south of the Beining Railway, abandoned the city and fled north under the shock of our army's might, and the city was immediately recaptured by us.
