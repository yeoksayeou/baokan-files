Loans Should Be Granted to Hired and Poor Peasants
　　Fu Ting

In order to ensure that future loans from the Jincheng Bank truly play a role in supporting the production of hired and poor peasants, the loan work was discussed at the county-level conference of over a thousand labor heroes. During the discussion, the masses severely criticized the past loan work and put forward valuable suggestions for future improvements. The review of past loan work included the following points: 1. The class line was not clear. Some village cadres were hired and poor peasants, and granting them loans greatly helped in supporting the production of hired and poor peasants. For example, Liu Shixing, the chairman of the farmers' association in Jinjiang Village, Fourth District, borrowed 2.6 million yuan and organized the masses to engage in transportation, earning 12 million yuan in six months. This not only solved the masses' clothing and pocket money problems but also bought back 45 heads of livestock. Now, most of the hired and poor peasants in the village have livestock. However, there were also many cadres with bad backgrounds who borrowed money in the name of mass production to engage in speculation and profiteering, or to take care of their relatives and friends, and even some who lent to struggle targets. For example, the masses in Yangjiashan said, "Cadres have power, and as long as they stamp the document, they can get a loan. The masses cannot get a loan without a letter of introduction from the cadres." The masses in Liuliujing said, "Our village cadres borrowed money and bought sheep with local bullies, and the masses could not get a loan at all." The masses in Beishiweng said, "Our village chief borrowed money in the name of collecting money for the bank, collected all the money borrowed by the masses, and bought livestock for himself." The cadres in Gedongyan, Second District, lost their loans to gambling. The hired and poor peasants in West Street said most vividly, "We are always called upon for errands, we are never missed for burdens, the good fruits are not shared with us, we can't get bank loans, and public and private shops look down on us (meaning we can't find a guarantor)." These problems tell us how vague and wrong the class line of loans was. 2. The loan procedures were troublesome. In the past, it was stipulated that loans must be guaranteed by shops or well-to-do households, which restricted the hired and poor peasants. For example, the masses in Nanzhuang said, "If we have to find shopkeepers to guarantee loans, then we poor people will never get a loan in our lives." In some areas, because they were far from the bank, when introducing loans, they were introduced from natural villages to administrative villages, from administrative villages to districts, and then from districts to the bank. Because they were far from the city and unfamiliar with the people, they could not find a guarantor and had to take the contract back to stamp it, which took six or seven days to go back and forth. For example, the masses in the Sixth District said, "The money earned is only enough to pay interest to the bank after deducting road expenses." Therefore, the masses are also very dissatisfied with our loan procedures. 3. There was no focus in the loans. Some districts and villages distributed the loans evenly, thinking that every village and household should get a loan. As a result, every household got a loan, but none of them solved the problem. For example, Qiuchuan Village, Sixth District, loaned 50,000 yuan to more than 100 households in five natural villages, with each household getting 300 or 200 yuan, which was of no help at all. Therefore, the masses said, "Not to mention loans for production, even the loss of working time for meetings (referring to loan meetings) is not enough." 4. Too much emphasis was placed on combining idle funds and uses. In the past, the use of loans was stipulated very rigidly, and the masses could not get a loan if their production use did not meet our regulations. For example, the masses said, "The bank's money is for buying salt, and we dare not use it to buy oil." This not only restricted the scope of the masses' production activities but also restricted the turnover of funds. For example, Qu Tou Village borrowed 50,000 yuan, which was not enough to buy livestock. They planned to buy pigs and then buy livestock with the money they earned, but when they asked the district cadres for instructions, the district cadres did not allow it and insisted that they buy livestock. As a result, because they could not raise enough money, the loan had to be left unused. Another example is Ershenhou, which borrowed 100,000 yuan, which was only enough to buy one head of livestock, but the district cadres emphasized that they had to combine it with idle funds to buy three heads. Because the masses could not raise the funds, they had to buy goods with all the money and bought three of the worst livestock, which they tied to the trough and dared not move. The masses said, "This not only did not solve our difficulties but also increased our troubles." Because we overemphasized the combination of idle funds and uses, most of the loans were granted to middle peasants with cars and livestock. The hired and poor peasants could not get loans because they could not raise idle funds or did not meet our stipulated uses. These problems all show how vague our class views are.

For the future loan methods, after the masses' deliberation and discussion, and the cadres' deep reflection on their thoughts, the following points were clearly put forward: 1. Clarify the class stand, and grant loans to hired and poor peasants, and the family members of soldiers, cadres, and martyrs who are hired and poor, to help them solve the difficulties in production, prevent bad cadres from engaging in favoritism and selfishness, and organize loan groups or loan committees with hired and poor peasants as the leading backbone, and give the loan power to the hired and poor peasants, so that they can control, evaluate, and decide for themselves. 2. Simplify the procedures as much as possible, and implement the method of going far and coming near. Villages near the bank come to the bank to borrow, and in places far away, bank cadres personally carry the money down to the villages, combined with good cooperatives to handle it, and bank cadres go deep into the rural areas to understand the situation, and grant the loans by starting with organizing mass production. Any guarantee is not necessary, and a certificate from the farmers' association or the hired and poor peasant group is sufficient. 3. Loans must be issued with emphasis. From the district's perspective, it is the disaster-stricken areas and poor areas, and we should help them get rich in production with the spirit of filling poverty and supplementing poverty. From the village and household perspective, the loan must solve the main difficulties of a village or a household, and the villages and households that have not been loaned will be loaned next time, so as not to disperse forces. 4. The term should be flexible and determined according to the actual needs of the masses, and truly achieve long-term lending and repayment, lending and repayment at any time, and giving the masses the convenience of borrowing in small amounts and repaying in full or borrowing in full and repaying in small amounts. This can not only speed up the turnover but also enable loans to play their role in production and famine relief. 5. Vigorously develop rural credit and lending relations, and advocate the method of raising funds if you have money, borrowing money if you don't have money, and helping each other with labor and capital. The use is generally not stipulated, and we should try our best to engage in activities according to the specific needs of the masses in production. 6. Bank cadres must, under the unified leadership of the Party, combine with the central work to understand the situation, trust the masses, and support and organize mass production. In the issuance of new loans, old loans must be universally inspected, and non-class-line loans must be thoroughly rectified, and all must be re-lent, corrected, or recovered.

　　款要贷给雇贫农
    辅庭
    晋城银行为了使今后的贷款，真正在扶植雇贫生产上起到作用，因此在县里召开的千余劳英会上，把贷款工作作了讨论。在讨论中，群众对过去的贷款做了严厉的批判，并对今后改进上也提出了很宝贵的意见：在对过去贷款工作的检讨中，有以下几点：一、阶级路线不明确。有些村村干是雇贫，贷上款，对扶植雇贫生产上，即起很大作用。如四区金匠村农会主席刘士兴，贷款二十六万元，组织群众搞运输，半年赚洋一千二百万元，除解决了群众穿衣零花问题，还买回牲口四十五头，现在该村大部雇贫都有了牲口。但还有许多成份不好的干部，假借群众生产名义，贷上款自己搞投机买卖，或者照顾自己的亲朋，甚至还有贷给斗争对象的。如杨家山群众说：“干部有权，只要盖上图章就能贷上款，群众没有干部介绍信银行不贷给。”六六井群众说：“我们村干部贷上款，和恶霸伙买羊，群众根本贷不上。”北石瓮群众说：“我们的村长，假借银行收款名义，把群众贷的款都收起来，自己买成牲口。”二区圪洞沿的干部贷上款赌博输了。西街雇贫农说的最生动：“支差有咱，负担不漏咱，好果实不分给咱，银行贷款轮不上咱，公私商店看不起咱（找不上保的意思）。”从这些问题中，告诉了我们，贷款的阶级路线，是如何的模糊与错误。二、贷款的手续麻烦。过去规定贷款必须找铺保或殷实户保，这样就把雇贫农限制住了。如南庄群众说：“如果贷款非找铺保不行，那我们穷人一辈子也贷不上。”还有些地区，因距银行远，介绍贷款时由自然村介绍到行政村，由行政村介绍到区，再由区介绍来银行，因为距城远人事生疏，找不到保人，还得拿上契约回去盖章，来回得六七天。如六区群众说：“赚几个钱除了路上化费，只够给银行上利。”所以群众对我们的贷款手续，亦是很不满意的。三、贷款没重点。有些区村把贷款都平均分散了，认为村村户户都应该贷，结果是家家都贷，家家都不解决问题。如六区秋泉村贷款五万元，就贷了五个自然村一百多户，每户都是三百、二百元，根本无济于事。因此，群众说：“不说贷款生产，就连开会（指贷款开会）误工钱都不够。”四、过分强调结合游资和用途。过去在贷款用途上规定的很死板，群众的生产用途不合乎我们的规定就贷不上，如群众说：“银行的钱是买盐钱不敢打油。”这样不但限制了群众的生产活动范围，同时也限制了资金周转。如渠头村贷款五万元，不够买牲口，计划买成猪，赚了钱再买牲口，去请示区干部，区干部不允许，非叫买成牲口，结果因凑不上钱，贷款只好放着不用。又如二神后贷款十万元，只够买一头牲口，但区干部强调非叫结合上游资买三头不行，因群众集不上资，只好尽钱买货，买了三头最坏的牲口，拴在槽上一点不敢动，群众说：“这不但没解决了我们的困难，反而增加了我们的麻烦。”因为我们过分强调结合游资与用途，因此，绝大部分贷款贷在了有车有牲口的中农身上，雇贫农因集不上游资或不合乎我们规定的用途，因此就没贷上款。这些问题都说明我们的阶级观点，是多么模糊。
    对于今后的贷款办法，经过了群众的酝酿讨论，与干部在思想上的深刻反省，明确的提出如下几点：一、明确阶级立场，把款贷给雇贫农，及雇贫的军、干、烈属，帮助他们解决生产中的困难，防止坏干部徇情包办自私，以雇贫为领导骨干组织贷款小组或贷款委员会，把贷款权交给雇贫，让他们自己去掌握、评议、决定。二、手续尽量求简便，实行远去近来的办法。距银行近的村庄来银行贷，远的地方，银行干部亲自背款下去，结合好的合作社代办，银行干部深入农村了解情况，从组织群众生产入手把款贷下去。什么保都可以不要，有农会或雇贫小组证明即可。三、必须有重点的发放。从区来说，就是灾荒区和穷苦区，应以填贫补穷的精神，帮助其在生产中发家。按村户来说，贷款必须解决一村或一户的主要困难，没贷的村户下次再贷，这样才不致于分散力量。四、期限要灵活，根据群众实际需要确定，真正做到长年收放，随收随放，给予群众零借整还或整借零还的方便。这样既可加速周转，又能使贷款在生产渡荒中，发挥它的作用。五、大量开展农村信用借贷关系，提倡有钱集资，无钱贷款，劳资互助起来的办法。用途一般不做规定，根据群众在生产中的具体需要尽量活动。六、银行干部必须在党的统一领导下，结合中心工作了解情况，相信群众，扶植与组织群众生产。在发放新贷中，必须普遍检查旧贷，彻底整顿非阶级路线的贷款，一律转贷纠正或收回。
