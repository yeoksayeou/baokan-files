Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: The armed uprising of the people in Yunnan is developing rapidly. According to a Yunnan dispatch in the Shanghai magazine "Shi Yu Wen" (Time and Literature), Volume 2, Issue 2: The armed uprising of the people in the counties of Luliang, Mile, Qiubei, etc., southeast of Kunming on the east side of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, under the leadership of Yang Tiyuan, Zhao Yonggui, and others, has gained great momentum recently. Yang Tiyuan's troops in Luliang County alone number more than seven thousand. They recently fought two battles with the Chiang bandit troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits. Zhao Yonggui's troops, numbering more than five hundred, are centered in Mile and are expanding their activities to nearby counties. Wherever they go, they attack local tyrants and distribute grain and wealth, gaining the deep support of the people. After defeating a Chiang bandit battalion in August of this year, their military prestige has further increased. The armed uprising of the people, based in Qiubei County, has ample armaments and a tight organization, and has repeatedly won victories against the Chiang bandit troops. The Chiang bandits in Gejiu once sent a brigade to "encircle and suppress" them, but they were also defeated by the people's army. In addition, a large force of armed uprisings has appeared in the Qiaojia County area on the Kang-Dian border in northern Yunnan. According to the Tianjin Dagongbao newspaper, peasant armed forces are also widespread in the counties of Shiping, Yuanjiang, Longwu, and Xinping on the west side of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway.

    【新华社陕北九日电】云南民变武装发展迅速。据上海“时与文”杂志二卷二期云南通讯称：滇越铁路东侧昆明东南陆良、弥勒、邱北等县民变武装，在杨体元、赵永贵等领导下，近来声势极大。仅陆良县杨体元部即有七千余人，近曾与蒋匪军作战二次，匪军死伤惨重。赵永贵部五百余人，以弥勒为中心，向附近各县展开活动。所到之处均实行打恶霸分粮财，深得人民拥护。今年八月间击败蒋匪一个营后，军威更震。以邱北县为根据地之民变武装，军械充足，组织严密，与蒋匪军屡战屡捷。个旧蒋匪曾派一个旅前往“围剿”，亦被民军击溃。此外云南北部康滇边之巧家县一带，亦有大队民变武装出现。另据天津大公报消息：滇越铁路西侧之石屏、元江、龙武、新平等县亦遍布农民武装。
