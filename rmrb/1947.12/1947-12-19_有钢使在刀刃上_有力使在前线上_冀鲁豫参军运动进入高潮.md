    Steel Should Be Used on the Blade
    Strength Should Be Used on the Front Line
    The Military Recruitment Movement in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Enters a Climax
    [This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 17th Dispatch] The military recruitment movement against Chiang and for the annihilation of Chiang in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has entered a climax. The eighth sub-district, Puyang, Nanle, and Neihuang, began the effort in early November, and 500,000 liberated peasants enthusiastically joined this upsurge. After discussing the situation, the cadres and masses of Neihuang recalled the 58 days of disaster suffered when Chiang's bandits attacked Neihuang, and they complained and consciously proposed joining the army for revenge. After recognizing the situation and clarifying their thinking, Nanle combined partial grievances with current affairs propaganda, put forward the glorious task of "Overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek and defending the good times," and set off a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. After complaining and discussing the favorable situation of the counter-offensive, the masses of Puyang consciously proposed "Joining the army to protect their liberation." The masses enthusiastically signed up to join the army, with fathers sending off their sons, wives sending off their husbands, honored soldiers returning to the front line, and teachers and students vying to sign up. It is estimated that 21,000 people have signed up to join the army in the three counties, and they are now being reviewed and concentrated for formation. The fourth sub-district, Hua County, Gaoling, Changyuan, and Weinan, put forward the slogan "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and get rid of Wang Sanzhu along the way!" (Note: Wang Sanzhu was a local tyrant who often looted and conscripted soldiers in that area, and the masses hated him to the bone). The entire sub-district has launched a revenge self-reporting military recruitment movement. From November 15th to 20th, in half a month, statistics from 19 districts in the four counties showed that 17,960 people had consciously signed up, including 11,300 people from nine districts in Hua County alone. The general process of the movement is as follows: The county first convened a county and district cadre military recruitment movement conference to study the current situation and resolve the relationship between personal and self-defense wars, which strengthened the determination of cadres and the masses to participate in the counter-offensive army. From "understanding the masses," the cadres learned about the masses' strong demands for "annihilating Chiang for revenge" and "protecting their fields and lives" to join the army. After the cadre conference, village cadres and activists conferences were convened in counties or districts to deliberate and discuss the national counter-offensive situation, so that the masses realized that everyone had a share in fighting old Chiang. During the discussion of current affairs, a grievance movement against the Chiang army and landlords was launched, arousing the masses' high degree of righteous indignation for "annihilating Chiang for revenge." From "thinking and comparing" and "liberation memories," the masses automatically proposed: "Steel should be used on the blade, and strength should be used on the front line." "If we can't catch the treacherous officials, the play won't end; if we can't defeat Chiang, it won't be over." This sparked a mass military recruitment movement, and registration is still continuing. In the sixth sub-district, Chiping, Boping, Dong'a and other counties, a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army has also been launched. In the ninth district of Boping, the masses in each village challenged each other to see who was more conscious and willing and who did a better job of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and selected representatives to check the military recruitment movement in each village.
