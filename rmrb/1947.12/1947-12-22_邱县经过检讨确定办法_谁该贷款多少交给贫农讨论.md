　　【Report from our Jinnan Office on the 20th】In order to organize poor peasant production and solve the difficulties of poor peasants, the Qiu County Committee examined past loan work on the 5th of this month and conducted a detailed study of sideline loans for this winter. In the past, due to the lack of clarity regarding the class line in production, the impurity of leading elements in the villages, and the leadership only working through village cadres instead of the poor peasants, many poor peasants were unable to obtain loans, and village cadres arbitrarily distributed the loans. At the same time, past loans were too dispersed, and although poor peasants received a small portion of the loans, it did not have much of an effect. Therefore, it was decided that sideline loans this winter must be discussed by poor peasants and truly lent to the poorest peasants so that the loans can truly play a role. After everyone's discussion, the following methods were proposed: 1. County and district cadres should conduct investigations in the villages and the poorest villages most severely affected by disasters, or villages with a production base, to understand what kind of production the poor peasants are engaged in and how much loans they need. After understanding this, it should be submitted to the poor peasants for discussion and evaluation, and then loans should be obtained from the bank. This can avoid village cadres taking over and not following the poor peasant line. 2. Loans from cooperatives and mutual aid teams should also be lent to individuals, not to the cooperative or team, to avoid the poor peasants suffering losses. 3. Loans must be based on the specific difficulties of the poor peasants, lending as much as is needed, and lending to as many villages as possible, to avoid dispersing loans and failing to achieve results. 4. In the future, loans will be given to households within the village, and to villages within the district, with district cadres responsible for timely recovery of loans and timely resolution of the production difficulties of poor peasants. Following this, based on the poverty and disaster situation in each district, it was decided to loan 6 million yuan to the first district, 4 million yuan to the third district, 5 million yuan each to the first and fourth districts, for a total of 20 million yuan loaned to the four districts. Finally, it was emphasized to the cadres of each district that they should overcome the idea that loan work is solely done by bank cadres, and clarify that this work is the responsibility of every cadre. They should promptly check and summarize whether loans have been truly lent to poor peasants and what role they are playing in the hands of poor peasants. After the meeting, the cadres of each district have been conducting in-depth investigations among poor peasants in key villages to carry out loan work.

　　邱县经过检讨确定办法
  　谁该贷款多少交给贫农讨论
    【本报冀南二十日电】邱县为了组织贫农生产，解决贫农困难，县委会于本月五日检查过去贷款工作，并对今冬副业贷款做了详尽研究。过去因对生产中的阶级路线不明确，村中领导成份不纯，领导上只通过村干，不通过贫农，所以使不少贫农贷不上款，村干任意支配贷款。同时，过去贷款又过于分散，贫农虽贷了一少部分款，也没起了多大作用。因此决定今冬副业贷款一定要通过贫农讨论，真正贷给最贫的贫农，使贷款真正能起到作用。经大家讨论，提出以下办法：一、县区干部要深入灾荒最严重的村和最穷的村或生产有基础的村庄进行调查，了解贫农搞什么生产，需要多少贷款。了解后，再交贫农讨论评议，到银行贷款，这样可避免村干包办，不走贫农路线。二、合作社和互助组贷款也贷给个人，不贷给社和组，以免贫农吃了亏。三、贷款一定要根据贫农具体困难，需要多少就贷多少，能贷几个村就贷几个村，以免贷款分散，起不了作用。四、今后贷款离户不离村，离村不离区，区干负责，及时收贷，及时解决贫农生产困难。接着根据各区穷困、灾情，决定一区六百万元，三区四百万元，一、四区各五百万元，四个区共贷款两千万元。最后向各区干部强调指出，要克服单纯认为贷款工作是银行干部做的思想，明确这一工作是每个干部的责任，要及时检查总结贷款是否真正贷给了贫农，在贫农手中起什么作用。会后，各区干部已在各重点村深入贫农调查，进行贷款工作。
