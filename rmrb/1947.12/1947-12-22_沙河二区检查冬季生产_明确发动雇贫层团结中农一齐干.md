　　Shahe Second District Inspects Winter Production
  　Clearly Mobilize the Poor Laborers to Unite with Middle Peasants and Work Together
    [This newspaper's Shahe report] Since the Second District held an enlarged meeting of village cadres and mutual aid team leaders on the 18th of last month to discuss the direction and plan of winter production, for the past twenty-two days, the leadership has discovered that in most villages, men are drifting in winter production, the poor laborers have not been mobilized, and they have even less power; although women's spinning and weaving have achieved some success, it is not widespread enough. On the 10th of this month, the leadership took the initiative to convene a four-day district cadre meeting to examine the ideological leadership issues of this period. Comrade Yuan Mingcun said: "During this period, I have been only understanding the situation of the masses' emancipation. I thought there was nothing to do in winter when 'water is blocked and grass is withered,' and I didn't take winter production seriously." Comrade Wang Dongxi said: "My leadership of winter production did not penetrate the poor laborers. For example, those two bamboo basket weaving groups in Cailin Village, I only knew that they were making a lot of money, but I didn't know exactly how much money they were making." Comrade Wang Huiquan said: "When I went to Beipenshui, I only held two winter production meetings for village cadres. I didn't know to go deep into the poor laborers to promote winter production, so nothing was achieved." Du Wenlin said: "When I went to Gongdewang this time, I only listened to the village cadres. I didn't go deep into the poor laborers. An old hired worker asked me to sit at his house for a while, but I just grunted and didn't go. This time when I go back, I must go deep into the poor laboring class!" Comrade Fen Shuyuan said: "Because I didn't go deep into the poor laboring class during this period, I only held a branch meeting, a cadre meeting, or a mutual aid team leader meeting when I went to the village. I thought the masses had all been emancipated and there were no difficulties. It's very cold in winter, what can we do? This time when I went to Anhe Village, I first held more than twenty meetings of poor laborers. They all said that cutting firewood in winter is a good way to make a living. Each person can cut sixty catties a day, and each catty sells for thirteen yuan, which means they can sell seven hundred and eighty yuan. If they have the opportunity, they can also do some small business, deliver goods, or transport goods." Comrade Yuan also said: "If there is no way out, ask the poor laborers. In the past, we only shouted that the poor laborers are in charge, the poor laborers are the backbone, and the poor laborers are the leaders, but in reality, we didn't go deep into the poor laborers." After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed: nothing can be accomplished without going deep into the poor laborers. Then, they immediately discussed the Taihang Administrative Office's emergency call to overcome paralysis and wait and carry out winter production. Everyone further clarified the erroneous ideas of paralysis and waiting and not going deep into the poor laborers in the previous stage. Everyone scrambled to say: this time when we go down, we must be responsible for the livelihood of the vast poor laborers, and we must not lose the middle peasants. We must take the poor laborers as the main force to carry out winter production.

　　沙河二区检查冬季生产
  　明确发动雇贫层团结中农一齐干
    【本报沙河讯】二区自上月十八号召开了全区各村干部及互助组长扩大会议，讨论了今冬生产方向和计划后，至今二十二天，领导上发现了大部村庄男人在冬季生产中陷于自流，雇贫阶层没有发动起来，更没当权；妇女纺织虽然搞的有点成绩，但不够普遍。领导上即在本月十号主动召开了四天全区区干部会议，检查这一段的思想领导问题。元明存同志说：“我这一段光在了解群众翻身情况哩，我想冬天‘水塞草苦’没啥搞，没有把冬季生产当一回事做。”王东喜同志说：“我领导冬季生产没有深入雇贫层，比方菜林村那两个编箩头组，我光知道人家赚钱不少，但不知到底赚了多少钱。”王会全同志说：“我到北盆水，光给村干部开了两次冬季生产会，不知道深入雇贫去推动冬季生产，结果啥也没有搞起来。”杜文林同志说：“我这次到功德旺，光听村干部说的，没有深入雇贫，有一个老雇工，叫我去他家坐一会，我光哼了声，没有去，这次回去可要深入雇贫阶层哩！”分书元同志说：“由于这一段没有深入雇贫阶层，到村只开一个支部会、干部会，或者互助组长会就算了，我认为群众都翻了身，不困难了，冬天冷的很，干啥呢。这次我到安河村，首先开了二十多个雇贫的会议，他们都说冬天割柴就是好营生，每人一天能割六十斤，每斤卖十三元，即能卖七百八十元，遇机会了，还能做个小买卖呀，送脚呀，运输呀。”元同志又说：“没出路就问雇贫，以前咱光喊雇贫当家呀，雇贫骨干呀，雇贫带头呀，实际没有深入雇贫。”经讨论后，大家一致认为：不深入雇贫诸事不成。又紧接着讨论了太行行署再一次紧急号召克服麻痹等待开展冬季生产的消息，大家更明确了前一段麻痹等待不深入雇贫的错误思想，大家都争先恐后的说：这次下去一定要为广大雇贫层的生计负责，也不能丢掉中农，一定要以雇贫为主的把冬季生产搞起来。　　（新生）
