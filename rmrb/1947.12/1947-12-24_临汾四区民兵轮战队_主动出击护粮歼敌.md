　　【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd Telegram】 The Linfen Fourth District Rotation Team and militia, in the twenty days from November 6th to 26th, actively attacked to protect grain and repeatedly defeated invading Yan bandits. On November 6th, more than 20 members of the Yan bandits' direct unit were robbing grain in our Xinjiu Joint Defense Village. When a certain rotation team in our Fourth District heard about this, they immediately ran to the village, drove the enemy away, and recovered one cart (more than one dan) of miscellaneous grains, one cart of charcoal, and other miscellaneous items, all of which were handed over to the masses. At that time, seeing that our militiamen were not wearing cotton-padded clothes, the masses took out cotton-padded clothes from their own homes and put them on the militiamen. After our militiamen rested, they returned the cotton-padded clothes to the masses and safely returned to their defense area. On the night of the 7th, more than ten of our militiamen suddenly went to Duandian Village, which was more than a li away from the enemy, and brought back the donkey of a fugitive struggle object from Liu Village, which was handed over to the Liu Village Farmers' Association for disposal. On the 18th, twelve of our militiamen went to the east and west Wang Villages within the enemy's blockade line, defeated the enemy's "Township Office," and posted 50 copies of leaflets. On the 20th, sixteen of our militiamen went to the Dongkongke area to cover a mass meeting. When they arrived at Dongkong Wanggeta, they encountered 206 members of the enemy's 204th Regiment robbing grain and conscripting soldiers in Nanyongan Village and Xiliangwang. Our militiamen bravely attacked and defeated the enemy, protected the meeting, and posted more than 130 leaflets and wrote more than 70 slogans. On the 21st, more than 30 members of the small and medium-sized rotation teams in our Fourth District, in coordination with more than 10 Hongdong expedition militiamen, ambushed the enemy's heart, Xinzhuang Village, captured four enemies, and seized four 7.9 rifles. On the night of the 23rd, the militiamen of our South Sub-district went to the west Wang Village on the enemy's blockade line and captured four enemy intelligence officers and one plainclothes member of the 204th Regiment. On the night of the 25th, the Fourth District Rotation Team, in coordination with two platoons of the Hongdong Independent Battalion, set up an ambush in the west Wang Village, three or four li away from the enemy's Xin Yingpan. The next day (26th) at dawn, sixteen or seventeen members of the enemy's Qiaoli "Township Office" and miscellaneous stubborn elements came to the west Wang Village to rob fodder. They entered our ambush area. Our rotation team and the Independent Battalion immediately rushed up and defeated the enemy, causing them to flee in all directions. One enemy was killed, three enemies were wounded, and three rifles were seized.
