　　【Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 2nd】 Nanle County has unleashed democracy, followed the mass line, and handed over the military recruitment task to the masses for discussion, achieving complete consciousness and voluntarism, creating a vigorous military recruitment movement throughout the county. Currently, over 5,300 people in the county have enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army. The process involves in-depth discussions and deliberations at the district, sub-district, village, and group levels, making everyone realize that "Only by overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek can we secure our liberation." The method of mass education of the masses is used to enlighten and influence each other, and typical examples are used to drive the general effort. During the movement, some cadres adopted bureaucratic or simplistic approaches, resulting in slow progress. For example, cadres in Gu Village in the Fifth District simply said, "Those with more brothers should volunteer!" As a result, no one volunteered. Some who were forced to volunteer demanded money and fruits of struggle from the village in a bargaining manner. After discovering this, the leadership immediately made great efforts to correct it, emphasizing starting from ideological mobilization, making everyone realize that "Everyone has a share in fighting Chiang," and as a result, all 24 young people in the village volunteered to join the army.
　　
　　【Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 3rd】 The military recruitment in Nanle, Neihuang, and Puyang in the Fourth Military Subdistrict of Hebei-Shandong-Henan has reached a climax. Hua County, Changyuan, Gaoling, and other counties are also vigorously carrying out the movement. On the 16th, the Fourth District of Nanle held a mass rally attended by over 10,000 people. 200 people from the Fifth Sub-district signed up on the spot, which greatly enlightened and educated the masses in various villages in the district. After the meeting, 19 young and middle-aged people from Xishaoji in the Second Sub-district wanted to join the army on the way home. After four or five days of deliberation and discussion in various villages throughout the district, 1,150 people have now arrived at the district reception center. The Fifth District has now gathered 1,330 new soldiers. The vigorous military recruitment movement in various districts is still developing. After the League Defense masses of Li Hou in the Third District of Neihuang held an activist meeting in the district, each village held a mass meeting on the 15th, first moving from casual talks to pouring out grievances in groups. Shang Sanmao from Lihou Village said, "The Kuomintang army is the backing of the landlords. When Chiang's Fifth Army was here, they scared and beat the poor, and laughed and chatted with the rich." Shang Deping said, "I used to be bullied by the landlords. Chiang's Fifth Army once beat me half to death!" All villages moved from complaining about the suffering caused by the landlords to complaining about the suffering caused by Chiang's army, thereby launching the military recruitment movement. During group discussions in Dongluzhou, everyone expressed their attitude. For example, Jiao Maizhu's family said, "I must persuade my husband to join the army!" Jiao Defang's family said, "If my husband joins the army, I will definitely not hold him back." Huang Xiangxian wanted to join the army, and his son Huang Zhangliu said, "Dad, you stay at home, let me go!" Over 30 people volunteered to sign up. Over 30 people also signed up in Xiluzhou. A total of 143 people signed up in the entire League Defense. On the 14th, the Second District held a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants in the League Defense. The director of the women's association of Liuzhuang in the Third League Defense voluntarily reported at the hero model meeting, "I have four sons. The eldest is in the First Column, and the second is in the Sixth Column. This time I guarantee to mobilize my third son to go." Currently, over 80 people have signed up in the League Defense, and over 100 people have signed up in the Second League Defense. Currently, over 500 people have signed up in the entire Second District. In Wangzhu Village in the First District of Puyang, after the military recruitment models Wang Chengxuan and Shen Fusheng signed up, 105 people in the village signed up to join the army. At Puyang Gancheng Elementary School, under the slogan of "Join the army to perform meritorious service for the people and liberate the oppressed compatriots across the country," 41 students signed up. In addition, the military recruitment movement has been launched in the Ninth District of Hua County, Hancun in the Tenth District of Changyuan, and Wuqiuji in the Ninth District, and the slogan of "Three Don'ts" has been put forward. When Gaoling started to deliberate, the district cadres had ideological concerns. Later, they started by talking about the masses' attitudes towards joining the army, and talked about the masses' ideological situation, which boosted everyone's confidence. Currently, the military recruitment movement has been launched in Xihejing in the Fourth District, Shangzhuang in the Third District, and the East Sub-district in the First District and various sub-districts in the Fourth District.

　　南乐参军掌握自愿原则
    纠正“强迫自动”现象
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】南乐县放手民主，走群众路线，把参军任务交群众讨论，完全自觉自愿，造成全县轰轰烈烈的参军运动。现全县已有五千三百多人踊跃参加解放军。其进行步骤是经过区、小区、村、小组等深入讨论酝酿，使大家认识到：“打倒蒋介石，翻身才牢靠”，以群众教育群众的方法，互相启发，互相影响，并以典型推动一般。在运动中，有些干部采取包办或简单方式，结果迟迟搞不起来。如五区谷村干部，简单的说了说：“谁家兄弟多，自动吧！”结果谁也不自动。而有些被迫自动的，又以讨价还价的方式要求村里给钱和斗争果实等。领导上发现后，立即大力纠正；强调从思想上发动做起，使大家认识“打老蒋人人有份”，结果，全村二十四名青年一致自愿报名参军。
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】冀鲁豫四分区南乐、内黄、濮阳参军已达高潮，滑县、长垣、高陵等县，也正在热烈开展中。南乐四区于十六号召开全区群众大会，到会达万余人，五小区当场报名的即二百人，给全区各村群众的启发教育很大。散会后，二小区西邵集的青壮年，回家的路上即有十九名要参军。全区各村经过了四、五天的酝酿讨论，现已有一千一百五十人到达区招待所。五区现已集中新战士一千三百三十名。现各区轰轰烈烈的参军运动，仍在继续发展中。内黄三区理后联防群众，自区里积极分子大会结束后，十五日各村召开群众大会，首先分组从漫谈中走上了诉苦，理后村尚三毛说“遭殃军是地主的后台，蒋匪第五军在时，见穷人就吓唬就打，对富人有说有笑。”尚德平说：“过去我受地主的气，蒋匪第五军有一次打的我差点要了命！”各村都是由诉地主的苦，走上诉蒋军的苦；由此，掀起参军运动。在东路州分组讨论时，每个人都表明了自己的态度，如焦麦柱家说：“我一定要劝俺丈夫去参军！”焦德方家说：“俺丈夫去参军，我保准不拉腿。”黄向先要去参军，他儿黄张流说：“爹，你在家，叫我去吧！”自动报名的三十余人。西路州也有三十余人报名，全联防共报名一百四十三人。二区十四日，分联防召开中贫农大会，三联防刘庄妇会主任，在英模大会上自报说：“我四个儿，大儿在一纵队，二儿在六纵队，这次我保证动员我三儿去。”现该联防报名八十余名；二联防百余名；现二区全区报名五百余名。濮阳一区王助村，在参军模范王成宣、申富生等报名后，全村即有一百零五人报名参军。濮阳干城完小，在“参军为人民立功，解放全国被压迫的同胞”的口号下，有四十一名学生报名。此外，滑县九区，长垣十区韩村及九区武邱集都已展开参军运动，并提出“三不要”的口号来。高陵开始酝酿时，区干有思想顾虑，后从群众对参军抱啥态度谈起些，谈出了群众思想情况，大家提高了信心，现四区西河京，三区尚庄，及一区东小区和四区各小区都已展开参军运动。
