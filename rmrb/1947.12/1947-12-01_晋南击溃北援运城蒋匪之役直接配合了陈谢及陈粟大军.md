[This article was] transmitted from the Jinnan Front on the 27th of this month: The process of the Jinnan People's Liberation Army's defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's troops aiding Yuncheng from the north is as follows: In mid-November, the Jinnan People's Liberation Army began to sweep away the Chiang bandits' "defense system" on the periphery of Yuncheng. The Chiang gang panicked and hurriedly extracted the First Brigade, the Twenty-eighth Brigade, the 247th Regiment and 248th Regiment of the Eighty-third Brigade, and the Eightieth and Eighty-first Regiments of the Twenty-seventh Brigade (previous reports omitted the 248th Regiment of the Eighty-third Brigade and the Eightieth and Eighty-first Regiments of the Twenty-seventh Brigade), and the First Battalion of the 250th Regiment of the Eighty-fourth Brigade, as well as Bandit Lei Wenqing's Third Battalion, a total of more than 25,000 men (previously mistakenly reported as more than 10,000 men), from the Northwest battlefield, preparing to move eastward along the Longhai Railway, and crossed the Yellow River northward from Pinglu. The so-called American tactical "air-ground coordination" was extremely terrible. Their aerial reconnaissance could only lead their own people into the encirclement prepared by the People's Liberation Army. On the 15th, they advanced to the mountainous area of Dalang Temple north of Pinglu, and only then did they realize that things were not good. It was difficult to advance or retreat, so they had to shrink back into the empty mountains and wilderness, without food or drink, and suffered several days of hunger. On the 18th, they hurriedly took some family members from Yuncheng and fled south again. But they had already fallen into the net. That night, our army began to attack from the east and west sides, twenty li apart. As soon as the gunfire rang out, the Chiang bandits were like fish and shrimp in a net, terrified, running and fleeing in chaos, and our army twisted and annihilated them in groups. The entire Second Battalion of the Eighty-fourth Regiment of the Twenty-eighth Brigade, one company each from the First and Third Battalions of the Eighty-third Regiment, and one company from the Sixty-second Regiment were all annihilated. The commander of the First Regiment of the First Brigade was wounded, the First Regiment was wiped out, and the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Third Regiment, Yuan Daotang, and the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Transport Regiment, Zhang Huanyu, were captured alive. From the 18th, the fierce battle continued until the night of the 21st. The Chiang bandits retreated southward while being beaten and crawling. Along the Xinzhungbu, Dcun, and Qilipo lines, abandoned corpses were all over the road. More than 3,700 officers and soldiers became victims of Chiang Kai-shek. The victory on the periphery of Yuncheng is not only a great encouragement for taking Yuncheng in the future, but especially it tied down the Chiang bandits' forces used to go to the Central Plains battlefield and eliminated their combat effectiveness, directly coordinating with the Chen-Su Army's large-scale sabotage battle on the Longhai Railway and the Chen-Xie Army's offensive in southern Henan, making these two armies achieve even more brilliant victories.

　　晋南击溃北援运城蒋匪之役直接配合了陈谢及陈粟大军
    【本报晋南前线二十七日电】晋南人民解放军击溃北援运城蒋匪经过如下：在十一月中旬，晋南人民解放军开始扫荡运城外围蒋匪“防御体系”，蒋家匪帮慌做一团，赶紧把七拼八凑从西北战场抽出准备沿陇海路东开的第一旅、第二十八旅、第八十三旅之二四七团、二四八团、第二十七旅之八十团、八十一团（前报遗漏八十三旅之二四八团、廿七旅之八十、八十一团），第八十四旅二五○团之第一营匪特雷文清部第三营等两万五千余人（前误为一万余人），由平陆渡河北上。所谓美国战术“陆空配合”，绝顶糟糕，其空中侦察，只能把他们的自己人引到解放军预备好的包围圈中。十五日进至平陆以北大郎庙山地，才发觉事情不妙，前进后退都很作难，只得缩在空山荒野里，没吃没喝，受了几天饥饿。十八日，又匆忙从运城接出一些眷属回头南窜。可是他们已经落网了，当晚我军从二十里的东西两侧开始出击，枪声一响，蒋匪如落网之鱼虾，惊恐莫名，乱奔乱逃，我军便一股一股扭住歼灭。二十八旅八十四团二营全部、八十三团一、三两营各一个连、六十二团一个连都被歼灭了，第一旅一团团长被打伤了，第一团被消灭了，第三团三营营长原道堂、辎重团第二营营长张焕宇被活捉了。从十八日一直激战至二十一日夜，蒋匪一边挨打一边连滚带爬的往南退却，辛庄堡、杜村、七里坡一线，遗弃的死尸满路，三千七百多官兵就此做了蒋贼的牺牲品。运城外围的胜利，不仅对今后攻取运城是很大的鼓舞，特别是把蒋匪用以到中原战场的兵力吸住，并且消灭其战斗力，直接配合了陈粟大军在陇海路的大破击战及陈谢大军在豫南的攻势，使这两路大军更获得辉煌胜利。
