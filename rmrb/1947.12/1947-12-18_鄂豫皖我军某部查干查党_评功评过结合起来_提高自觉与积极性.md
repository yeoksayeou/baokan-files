    Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 15th. After the battle of Gaoshanpu, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army universally launched a campaign of "checking merits and establishing merits" and "checking work, checking the Party," progressing from general finding, recording, checking, and recording merits to checking work and even checking the Party, implementing double commendation. The "check work, check Party" activities are led by the Party branch as the core. First, thorough mobilization is carried out, then groups repeatedly deliberate and collectively judge to select exemplary models. The discussion process is as follows: first, groups deliberate, then each person reports, then groups discuss and supplement reports, then full deliberation is conducted, and finally, votes are taken. In the "check work, check Party" activities, the evaluation of merits and demerits is combined with expressing good and opposing bad tendencies, clearly distinguishing between the merits and demerits of cadres and Party members, and specifically pointing out their strengths and weaknesses. One company commander was rated as "four good" (four advantages) and "six bad" (six shortcomings) in the evaluation. After the double check, the unit greatly expanded the troops' training and merit-establishment movement, and also greatly improved the consciousness and initiative of Party members. Cadres from the platoon to the regiment in a certain regiment were all swept up in the merit-establishment fever. During the merit evaluation process, the anti-traitor work was also launched. Someone in a certain company organized desertion, which was simultaneously discovered and reported by three departments to the higher authorities, thus cracking the case. Some backward heroes, after in-depth merit and demerit checks, had their hero titles revoked by the masses, while many unsung heroes were discovered and their merits were supplemented.

    鄂豫皖我军某部查干查党
    评功评过结合起来
    提高自觉与积极性
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十五日电】解放军某部于高山铺战斗后，普遍展开查功立功及查干查党运动，由一般的找好记好查功记功，进到查干以致查党，实行双重表扬。查干查党均以支部为领导核心，首先深入动员，然后分组反复酝酿，集体评判，选出英模。其讨论过程是：先分组酝酿后，由各人报告，再分组讨论及补充报告，再进行充分酝酿，最后投票表决，在查干查党中，把评功评过表好与反对不良倾向结合起来，对干部党员功过分明，具体指出其优缺点。某连长在评判中被评为四好（四个优点），六坏（六个缺点）。该部经过双查后，大大开展部队的练武与立功运动，亦大为提高了党员的自觉性与积极性。某团从班到团的干部，都卷入立功热潮，在评功过程中，并展开反奸工作，某连有人组织开小差，被三处同时发觉向上级报告，因而破获。某些落后了的英雄，经过深入的查功查过，群众取消了他的英雄称号，同时也查出了许多无名英雄，进行补功。
