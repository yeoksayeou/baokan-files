[This article transmitted from] Jinnan [Region], December 15th: This year's harvest in Wu Yi County was poor, and the grain harvested by the masses is not enough to eat. Developing mass-based thrift and organizing sideline production to lead the masses through the famine has attracted the attention of the leadership. On the 25th of last month, the County Committee convened a joint meeting of district committee secretaries to specifically study this issue. During the discussion, everyone agreed that the following situations should be noted in the current development of sideline occupations: (1) Those who do not have enough to eat this year are still the basic masses. These people have no extra money to do business. If they sell their grain to make capital, they are afraid that the profits from the business will not keep up with rising prices in the future, which is actually a loss. At the same time, most of these people do not have business skills, have not been out of the area, and have few acquaintances everywhere, making business feel even more difficult. They also do not hope to set up a large cooperative and wait for dividends. What they hope for is to get immediate profits that they can use immediately, because their harvest is not good and they need to earn and use immediately. This is the main target for leading the masses to overcome the famine this year. If the problems of this part of the masses are not solved, then simply shouting slogans about organizing sideline occupations is a waste of effort. (2) There have been some deviations in the assessment and evaluation of sideline industries and commerce this autumn, which have affected the development of sideline occupations and made some people have concerns when engaging in sideline occupations. Based on the above situation, everyone clearly understands that the main key to developing sideline occupations and overcoming the spring famine next year lies here. Therefore, in terms of policy, in addition to general appeals, there should be a focus. Do not demand the organization of large-scale cooperatives and stores, but start from the practical interests of the masses, according to the habits of the local masses, help them develop whatever they know how to do, and call for voluntary and conscious labor and technical cooperation. The slogans are "A saw makes sawdust, doing something is better than being idle," and "Doing a little work can get food, which can save the family's resources." At the same time, combine this with calculating accounts for each household to clarify thinking, implement thrift, and vigorously promote production. Furthermore, in order to eliminate all ideological concerns of the masses on the road to developing sideline occupations, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and various cadres will explain the burden policy to the masses, explain our attitude towards developing sideline occupations, and educate all market exchanges to clarify the principle of serving the basic masses. In buying and selling transactions, they should give them all kinds of conveniences as a priority, and oppose taking "raw deals" (i.e., dealing with honest farmers who don't know anyone) based on personal feelings. During the meeting, everyone deeply discussed the importance of women in winter sideline occupations. Eighty percent of the women in the county know how to spin thread. According to current understanding, spinning one catty of thread can earn more than a thousand yuan. As long as this group of people can be mobilized, they will be a main force in overcoming the famine. Call on women to organize and launch a spinning and weaving movement, because only by organizing can they be more productive and do more. On the 27th of last month, the district secretaries returned to their respective districts and began to organize mass-based sideline production.

    武邑各区书研究冬季生产
    贫雇急需渡荒本钱
    【本报冀南十五日电】武邑今年年景歉收，群众所收粮食还不够用，发展群众性的节约及组织副业生产，领导群众渡荒，已引起领导上的注意。上月二十五日，县委会召集各区委书记联席会，专门研究这个问题。在讨论中，大家一致认为目前发展副业有以下几个情况是应注意的：（一）今年收成不够吃的人，依然是基本群众，这些人没余钱做买卖，拿粮食卖后做本，又怕将来买卖赚利赶不上物价上涨，实际上是赔钱。同时，这部分人又多数没有营业技术，没出过门，各处熟人又少，更感做买卖是个困难。他们也不希望搞个什么大合作社，等着分红，希望的是能得现利，顶现用就好，因为他们收成不好，需要这样现赚现用。这是今年领导群众渡荒的主要对象，这部分群众的问题得不到解决，而空喊组织副业，是白费工夫。（二）今秋在副业工商的征收执行中有某些评议不好等偏差，影响副业发展，使某些群众在搞副业时存在着顾虑。根据以上情况，大家明确今年发展副业渡过明年春荒的主要关键便在这里。因此，在方针上是，除一般的号召外，要有重点，不过高要求组织大型的合作社、商店，而从群众的现实利益着眼，根据当地群众的习惯，帮助其发展，会什么干什么，号召自愿自觉的劳力与技术合作，口号是“锯响就有末，干就比闲着强”，“干点活能搞吃，就能省下家里的。”同时结合按家具体算帐，打通思想，贯彻节约，厉行生产。更为了扫除群众开展副业道路上的一切思想顾虑，由工商局及各干部向群众解释负担政策，说明我们发展副业的态度，并教育各集市交易所，明确为基本群众服务的原则，在买卖成交上，应尽先给他们以各种便利，反对讲感情拿“生个”（即没熟人的庄稼老实人）。会中大家对妇女在冬季副业中的重要深加讨论。全县百分之八十的妇女，都会纺线，据目前了解，纺一斤线就能赚千余元，只要这部分人能动员起来，是一支渡荒主力军，号召妇女们组织起来，掀起纺织运动，因为只有组织起来，才更出活，干的多。上月二十七日，各区书已返回本区，动手组织群众性的副业生产。
