Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan Front, 7th. Frontline reporter Ji Yin reports on the circumstances before and after the capture of Jin Zhongchun, Chiang Kai-shek's Yongcheng County Chief: Since the counter-offensive army swept through the Yu Wan Su area, a group of Chiang Kai-shek's county chiefs were like stray dogs, fleeing east and west, running for their lives everywhere. Jin Zhongchun, Chiang Kai-shek's Yongcheng County Chief, took the county's "Self-Defense Corps" on September 18 and fled in a panic to Xiao County. Before the shock had subsided, the battle of the People's Liberation Army to break the Longhai Railway began again, and the army pressed directly on Xuzhou, scaring him into fleeing to Sanpu again. On November 16, Jin led his "Self-Defense Force" of more than a hundred people halfway, and encountered a team of militia from the Liberated Area. The "Self-Defense Force" scattered in all directions, leaving the county chief behind. He looked around blankly and had to hide in a thatched shed, shivering all night. The next day, he disguised himself as a paper merchant and ventured alone towards Caocun. However, this disguised paper merchant, wearing a black tattered cotton robe, speaking with a Zhejiang accent, and stammering, could not escape the eyes of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. After a little questioning, his face suddenly turned gray, and he begged to have a secret talk with the section chief of the People's Liberation Army. His first sentence was: "Please guarantee my safety, I will tell the truth." After the responsible comrade of the People's Liberation Army gave examples of the consistent lenient policy towards prisoners, he hesitantly gave a self-introduction. This man, who had become thin from fear in recent days, said that he was a senior staff officer of the Sixth Pacification Headquarters (of Chiang Kai-shek's regime), and that he was the most senior among the county chiefs in Henan Province. Because he wanted to find a lucrative position, he was recommended by Zhou, the commander-in-chief of the Sixth Pacification Headquarters, to become the county chief of Yongcheng in May. After taking office, he realized that he had been fooled. The so-called Yongcheng County actually only had a city area left, and the four rural areas were full of militia guerrillas, and he did not dare to leave the city a single step. County government staff surrounded him, begging for food, and the "Self-Defense Force" surrounded him, demanding pay. He really didn't get to eat mutton, but instead got a body full of its stench. After the People's Liberation Army entered the Yu Wan Su area, he led the "Self-Defense Force" to abandon the city and flee, relying entirely on plunder for survival. They were often attacked by the militia, and were frightened several times a day. He deeply regretted his confusion, and also blamed his "Self-Defense Force;" he said: "They only cared about escaping for their own lives, and abandoned me, the county chief."

    蒋匪官兵关系如此
    自卫队见我民兵就一哄而散
    永城县长被丢下来作了俘虏
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线七日电】前线记者季音报导蒋匪永城县长金仲椿被俘前后情形：自反攻大军进扫豫皖苏地区，一群蒋匪县长们有如丧家之犬，东奔西窜，四处逃命。蒋匪永城县长金仲椿九月十八日带了县“自卫总队”，慌忙逃到萧县。惊魂未定，解放军破击陇海路的战事又起，大军直逼徐州，吓得又拔腿逃向三铺。十一月十六日那天，金带领其“自卫队”百余人走到半路，碰到一队解放区的民兵，“自卫队”就一哄而散，丢下这个县长，他四顾茫茫，只好躲入一间草蓬里，打了一夜寒颤。次日他就装扮纸贩商人，独自冒险向曹村奔去。可是这个穿黑破棉袍，操浙江口音，言语支吾的伪装纸贩商人，终于瞒不过解放军战士的眼睛，稍经盘问后，他的脸色突呈灰色，哀求与解放军的科长作密谈，他第一句话是：“请你们千万保证我的生命安全，我讲实话。”经解放军负责同志举例说明一贯宽大的俘虏政策后，于是他吞吞吐吐地作了一个自我介绍。这位几天来因恐惧而显得消瘦了的人，说他是（蒋记）六绥署的高级参谋，河南全省县长中间数他的资历最高。因为自己想找个肥缺，五月间由六绥署周总司令保送来永城当县长。到任后，才知上了大当，原来所谓永城县，实际只剩下一个城区，四乡都是民兵游击队，不敢出城一步。县府职员围着他要饭吃，“自卫队”围着他要发饷，真是没有吃到羊肉，反沾来一身膻气。解放军进入豫皖苏后，他带着“自卫队”弃城出逃，全靠抢掠为生。经常被民兵袭击，一日数惊。他深悔自己糊涂，又埋怨他的“自卫队”；他说：“他们只顾自己逃命，把我县长也丢了。”
