Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Qingdao, Yantai, and other places are in a state of extreme panic. When our army captured Laiyang, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in Qingdao were extremely terrified. On the one hand, they intensified martial law, and on the other hand, Chiang's military police and relevant agencies organized a "Household Registration Blitz Team" to conduct spot checks on household registrations throughout the city. Chiang's officials in the city rushed to buy gold and valuables to prepare to flee. A regiment of enemy troops guarding Weixian were digging fortifications day and night. All the Chiang puppet local militia in the city were expelled from the city to prepare for "unforeseen circumstances." The Chiang bandits stationed in the city also forced male and female students in all middle schools to undergo "military training" in order to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang bandits. Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yantai forcibly conscript thousands of civilians every day to build defensive fortifications. Men must provide labor once every other day, and women must replace them if there are no men in the family. The wealthy must pay 30,000 yuan of Chiang currency every day as a substitute. A moat more than ten miles long, and one zhang four chi wide and deep, was dug from Dongshan via Grape Mountain, the South Playground to Xikouzi, and farmers near Sunjiafan were forced to dig up green seedlings and ancestral graves to build an airport for the Chiang bandits.

Furthermore, on the evening of December 2nd, seventeen men from a squad of the 8th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army, who were supervising the construction of an airport in Zhichu Village, 15 miles west of Yantai, rose up and beat their squad leader to death with wooden sticks (the deputy squad leader was injured and fled back to Yantai). Led by Meng Qinghua and Guo Zhixiang, they fled to the liberated area. However, when they crossed the Jia River (18 miles west of Yantai), they were caught up by Chiang's pursuing troops. They bravely fought back with hand grenades. Currently, Ding Xihua and seven others have safely arrived in our area.
