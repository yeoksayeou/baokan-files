Taiyue, 19th (Our Newspaper) The Jincheng Third District Sub-Committee inspected the line of employing the poor in winter production and discovered a serious resistance to the idea of employing the poor among middle peasants. At the district-wide political director conference on the 11th and 12th, it was learned that although transportation and weaving had been organized in the district in the past ten days, most of those organized were middle peasants. Only a few villages, such as Chihe, had some "consideration" for employing the poor, but they were still not truly standing on the side of the poor to serve them. The remaining villages did not care about employing the poor at all. Some village cadres, such as those in Yangshan Village, even opposed and undermined the organization of production for the poor, increasing their difficulties. When cadres from the base village organized a dozen poor women to weave in Yangshan, village cadres such as Suo Kui became furious. The next day, they gathered all the women in the village, regardless of whether they were poor, middle, or rich peasants, or targets of struggle, and formed them into groups, ordering them to solve their own capital problems and weave collectively. As a result, the poor women requested, "Let us do it ourselves!" More than 30 of the 37 villages in the district (4 villages did not arrive) did not serve the poor. After discovering this ideological resistance during the meeting, they promptly shifted to ideological inspection. Li Chunfa from Hecun examined himself, saying, "I am also a poor peasant who has turned over, but I have forgotten the difficulties of the poor. Although I have also promoted the need to take care of the poor at meetings, I lack the ideology of employing the poor, so I cannot actually serve the poor!" The political director of Changdian Village said, "When I returned from the district, I said I wanted to take care of the poor, but I didn't dare to discuss it within the mutual aid team because the ideas of middle peasants and poor peasants are different. Therefore, I only discussed it with the cadres and planned to lend some cotton to the poor who lacked labor so that they could participate in weaving in the mutual aid team. But one day's work was just enough to eat and drink, so I didn't take good care of them anymore!" The political director of Xiacun Village said, "At first, we嫌嫌麻烦嫌嫌麻烦嫌嫌麻烦嫌嫌麻烦嫌嫌麻烦嫌嫌麻烦didn't want to take care of the poor because we were afraid that the poor had nothing and everything was difficult. But now I think it's because I am a middle peasant, I don't know the difficulties of the poor, and I forget the interests of the poor, so I can't find a way to solve the difficulties of the poor!" Chuandi Village more profoundly examined the mechanical way of moving large mutual aid methods and the form of recording points based on work and distributing dividends based on work points, which actually harmed the interests of the poor. For example, the wage for each work of a kiln worker is eight liters of rice as shares. A middle peasant drives a cart three times a day to transport coal, earning four liters of rice and recording two work points. For two days, they earn eight liters of rice and record four work points. According to the distribution of dividends based on work points, the kiln worker can only distribute dividends based on two work points, while the middle peasant distributes dividends based on four work points. Some cadres felt ashamed after inspection at the meeting. However, when some cadres discussed how to serve the poor, absurd ideas revived. For example, the political director of Changdian said, "Let the targets of struggle engage in production together. In addition to eating and drinking, the surplus will take care of the poor. In addition, put the poor together and educate them on class viewpoints." This aroused sharp struggle from everyone: "What muddled thinking is this? You still don't have the poor in your eyes! You still want to educate the poor on class viewpoints, but it is the poor who need to educate you first!" At the end of the meeting, everyone was called upon to find ways to help the poor. Sihe Village used some of the capital previously raised to lend to the poor for transportation and weaving. Xiwu Village absorbed the poor to participate in the village's jointly opened store, which can share dividends in addition to eating and drinking. In addition to squeezing out loans from rich peasants and lending them to the poor, Guanshan Village also extracted a part of the undistributed fruits of struggle as production capital for the poor. At this time, various villages reported the undistributed fruits of struggle and public trees to lend to the poor for production. In summary, there are three methods: First, villages like Yuancun and Sihe organize the cooperation of labor, capital, and tools to benefit the poor and also benefit the middle peasants, and to take care of the poor as much as possible; Second, provide the money from the undistributed fruits of struggle and public trees to the poor as production capital; Third, resolutely squeeze out loans from landlords and rich peasants and re-lend them to the poor to solve their capital difficulties.

　　晋城三区检查冬季生产
  　纠正村干思想抵抗具体解决雇贫困难
    【本报太岳十九日电】晋城三区分委会检查冬季生产中的雇贫路线，发现严重的中农抵抗雇贫思想。在十一、二两日的全区政治主任会议上，了解到十天来全区虽然已组织起运输与纺织等，但组织的大部是中农，仅赤河等个别村子对雇贫有些“照顾”，仍不是真正站在雇贫立场上为雇贫服务，其余村庄根本未管雇贫，甚至如杨山村干部竟反对与破坏雇贫组织生产，增加雇贫困难。当基点村的干部在杨山组织了十几个雇贫妇女纺织时，村干部锁魁等即大发雷霆，第二天将全村所有妇女不分雇贫、中农、富农与斗争对象，皆召集起来，编成小组，命令各自解决资本，集体纺织，于是雇贫妇女要求“还是由自己干吧！”全区三十七个村（四村未到）就有三十余村未为雇贫服务。会议中发现这种思想抵抗后，及时转入检查思想。合村李春发检讨自己说：“我也是雇贫翻身的，可是忘了雇贫的困难，虽然也曾在会上宣传要照顾雇贫，就是缺乏雇贫思想，因此不能实际为雇贫服务！”常店村政治主任说：“从区上回去说要照顾雇贫，但不敢在互助组内讨论，因为中农与雇贫思想不一样，因此，我只和干部讨论讨论，计划借给无劳力的雇贫一些棉花，让她们参加互助组纺织，做一天刚够吃喝，也就不再好好照顾了！”下町村政治主任说：“咱开始嫌麻烦，不愿照顾雇贫，怕雇贫什么也没有，什么也困难，可是现在想想是因为自己是中农，不知雇贫困难，忘记雇贫利益，所以不能生法去解决雇贫困难！”川底村更深刻的检查出机械的搬运大互助办法，与按活记分、按工分红的形式，实际上更伤害了雇贫的利益。如窑工每工工资八升米入股，中农赶车一天拉三次炭，赚四升米，记两工，两天赚八升米，记四个工。按工分红，窑工只能以二工分红，中农则以四工分红。会中有些干部经检查后，很觉惭愧。但有些干部在讨论如何为雇贫服务时，荒谬的思想却又复活了，如常店政治主任说：“把斗争对象弄在一块闹生产，除吃喝外，剩余的照顾雇贫，另外把雇贫弄在一起，教育他们阶级观点。”引起大家尖锐的斗争：“你这是啥糊涂思想？还是眼中没有雇贫！还教育雇贫阶级观点哩，倒是需要雇贫先来教育一下你吧！”会议最后号召大家为雇贫想办法。寺河村用以前筹集的一些资本借给雇贫运输、纺织，西洼村吸收雇贫参加村中合伙开的店，除吃喝外还可分红。关山村除挤出富农贷款交给雇贫外，并在未分配的斗争果实内，抽出一部分作为雇贫生产资本。此时，各村纷纷报出未分配的斗争果实与公共树木，借给雇贫生产。综合起来，有三个办法：一、原村、寺河等类村庄，组织劳力、资本、工具三者合作，作到雇贫有利，中农也有利，并尽量多照顾雇贫；二、把未分配的斗争果实及公共树木的钱，供给雇贫作生产资本；三、坚决挤出地主富农的贷款，转贷给雇贫，解决他们资本困难。
