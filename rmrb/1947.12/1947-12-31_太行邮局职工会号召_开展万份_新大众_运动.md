　　Taihang Post Office Workers' Union Calls for
  　Launching a 10,000-Subscription "New Masses" Campaign
    [Our newspaper's Taihang dispatch on the 29th] The Taihang Post Office Workers' Union has called on all employees to launch a campaign to subscribe to 10,000 copies of the "New Masses" newspaper. The call stated: "The 'New Masses' newspaper is a popular newspaper for the peasant masses, intended for the broad masses of poor peasants, village cadres from poor and hired peasant backgrounds, and primary school teachers. It serves the struggle for the emancipation of the broad masses of hired and poor peasants, and it will be published starting in the New Year. To better distribute this newspaper and penetrate various village farmers' associations and hired and poor peasant groups, we will launch a campaign to subscribe to 10,000 copies of the 'New Masses' newspaper in January next year. We call on everyone to use a spirit of competition to quickly solicit subscriptions. (1) Discuss the 'New Masses' newspaper's change notice and subscription methods, understand whose newspaper 'New Masses' is, who should subscribe, and what the subscription methods are. (2) Conduct widespread publicity, publicizing it wherever you go. Through agency offices, township post offices, and township messengers, disseminate it to the farmers' associations and poor peasant leagues in every village, large and small. (3) Organize, assign responsibility by district and route, compete with each other, not only to get more subscriptions but also to get the right subscriptions. Expand retail sales, develop basic subscribers, and organize 'New Masses' reading groups."
