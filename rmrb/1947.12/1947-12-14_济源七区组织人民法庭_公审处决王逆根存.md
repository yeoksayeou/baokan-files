    Publicly Tries and Executes Traitor Wang Gencun
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 11th] On November 26th, the masses of 28 united villages in Jiyuan Seventh District held a public memorial for Yang Xiaotao, his uncle and nephew, who were innocently killed by Wang Gencun in Shaoyuan Town, and organized a people's court to publicly try the counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Gencun. Since November 20th, the military region's political department, administrative office, and directly subordinate organs organized a court to publicly try the counter-revolutionary criminal Wang Gencun, who was hidden within the troops, expelled him from the Party and the military, and handed him over to the masses of Jiyuan for handling. On November 28th, thousands of people from 28 united villages in Jiyuan Seventh District held a public memorial in Shaoyuan Town for the tragically deceased Yang Xiaotao, his uncle and nephew, and organized a people's court to publicly try the criminal Wang Gencun. On that day, the masses from all 28 united villages in the Seventh District carried sacrificial offerings, couplets, mourning banners, wreaths, and weapons, converging on the meeting place from all directions. Around 8:00 AM, the coffins of Yang Xiaotao, his uncle and nephew, were sent from Hong Village. The masses at the meeting immediately formed a team to welcome the coffins. Amidst mournful music and solemn atmosphere, the coffins were welcomed into the memorial hall, and a public memorial was held. Around 10:00 AM, the people's court publicly tried the criminal. First, the plaintiff filed a public prosecution, listing Wang Gencun's crimes: sabotaging land reform, inciting disunity among farmers, beating to death the innocent basic masses Yang Xiaotao, his uncle and nephew, injuring county and district cadres, attempting to beat to death Zhai Liangchao, the propaganda minister of the Jiyuan County Party Committee, and Zhang Duo, the district head, slandering Party and government cadres, and insulting the leader. After the criminal Wang Gencun was cross-examined on each count, he confessed without denial. The people's court then sentenced him to death according to the crimes he committed and the opinions of the masses.
