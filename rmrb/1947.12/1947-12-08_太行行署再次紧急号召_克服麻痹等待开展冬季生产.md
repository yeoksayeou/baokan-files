Taihang Administrative Office Issues Urgent Call Again: Overcome Numbness and Waiting, Launch Winter Production

[Report from our newspaper in Taihang, 6th] The Administrative Office here recently issued another urgent call for “Overcoming Numbness and Waiting, Launching the Winter Production Movement.” The content roughly states: When the autumn harvest work in the entire region was largely completed (early last month), the movement to supplement deficits through winter production, mainly sideline occupations, was proposed. However, according to the actual situation last month, winter production work in various places has not formed a widespread movement. Some areas are still stuck in planning and calls, and some counties are only talking about "combining with winter production" in their work arrangements, or even have not taken any action so far. In short, except for a few counties in the region, most areas have not guided this work with full spirit in terms of leadership. Some have made mobilization calls, but after mobilization and calling, they abandon their leadership responsibilities to engage in other work, while the masses' production activities are spontaneous and scattered, forming weakness and drift. The fact that winter production has not become the actual focus of leadership is indeed a serious problem that cannot be ignored at present. Although there are many objective difficulties this winter (autumn storage, joining the army, voluntary transport, cadre transfer to the south), they are not absolute obstacles to carrying out winter production. The main reasons for this are the following ideological problems in leadership: First, there is a mechanical determination in the subjective sense that winter production is also subordinate, and it is not convenient to emphasize it, so as not to disrupt the pace of the general review, causing the leadership to lose its focus first. Based on this understanding, the result will inevitably be only waiting, and winter production will be allowed to drift freely. This is the more common leadership concept at present. Second, after the autumn harvest, many areas, after a complete calculation of the family property, seem to think that the disaster is not serious, and a new numbness has arisen. Therefore, winter production is regarded as a routine article for the occasion, and it is "arranged" and handed over, relaxing the organizational and leadership responsibilities for this work. However, the current objective reality is that due to the serious natural disasters, the poor harvest is universal, but the lack of food is more common among the poor and hired laborers who have no production base and have newly established families. Most of their annual production cannot support them until the wheat harvest next year. In severely affected areas, they may not even be able to maintain until the end of the year. Therefore, we believe that this is due to the lack of practical investigation of the people's lives by some leading comrades - more precisely, the lack of investigation of class life, which has weakened their sense of responsibility for the people's livelihood. Here, we must remind the leading comrades in various places that when we calculate the annual harvest, we should go deep into the poor and hired laborers to see how these people's lives are. We cannot just look at the general average figures, feel that it is okay, and numb ourselves. From the calculation of the actual lives of the masses, it is clear to us that if we do not vigorously launch production this winter to make up for the poor harvest, we will force the masses to eat up their limited food, which will result in a serious disaster next year. At that time, the masses will be unable to take care of themselves, and the vast number of poor and hired laborers will fall into hunger, which will inevitably create great difficulties in future work, and the large-scale production movement next year will be even more unimaginable!

Finally, we call on everyone to be responsible for the livelihood of millions of people, and more directly responsible for the poor and hired laborers who are already facing the threat of hunger. Leaders must have a clear head and immediately overcome the unrealistic "waiting" and "numbness" thinking. They must face reality and face the lives of the masses. Re-examine your winter production plans and carry them out as the central task at present. Mobilize all cadres, continue to carry forward the spirit of fighting disaster and increasing production over the past year, combine the masses' demands for overcoming famine and supplementing deficits, and launch a mass and enthusiastic winter production movement. We must further understand the actual lives of the poor and hired laborers from action, so as to effectively solve their production difficulties and achieve the goal of increasing income and making up for deficits. We must also clarify a concept: whether this year's winter production can achieve results has become the key to overcoming famine and continuing to strengthen the support for the self-defense war in the future, and it is also the most effective practical preparation for welcoming the upcoming land reform and general review.

### 太行行署再次紧急号召  克服麻痹等待开展冬季生产

　　太行行署再次紧急号召
    克服麻痹等待开展冬季生产
    【本报太行六日电】此间行署顷再次发出“克服麻痹等待、开展冬季生产运动”的紧急号召，内容略谓：在全区三秋工作已大体结束的时候（上月初旬），即提出开展以副业为主的冬季生产补窟窿运动，但据上月的实际情况看来，各地冬季生产工作，并未形成普遍运动，有些地区，则仍停留在计划与号召上，也有的县份，甚至在工作安排上，只谈“结合冬季生产”，甚或至今仍无任何动静的也还不少。总之，全区除部分县份外，大部地区领导上并未以全部精神去指导这一工作，有的虽已作过动员号召，但在动员与号召之后，便抛开领导责任，去从事其他工作，而群众的生产活动则表现了自发和散乱，形成疲塌无力与自流。至今冬季生产没有成为实际工作的领导重心，这确是当前不容忽视的严重问题。虽然今年冬季在客观上，存在着许多（秋屯、参军、义运、干部南调）困难，但也不是进行冬季生产的绝对障碍，检查其主要原因，是领导上存在着如下的思想问题：首先是在主观上机械的认定，冬季生产也是附属的，不便强调，以免错乱了大复查的步调，使领导先失掉了重心。在这种认识的基础上，其结果必然是只有等待，冬季生产便因此而放任自流，这就是目前较为普遍存在的领导观念。其次是，不少地区在秋收之后，经过全部算家当的平均计算，似乎灾荒不要紧，产生了新的麻痹，因而对今冬生产就作为即时应景的照例文章，“布置”一番就作了交代，放松了对这一工作的组织与领导责任。而当前的客观实际，却是由于严重的自然灾害的袭击，歉收是普遍的，但缺粮较多的又是素无生产基础、新建家务的贫雇层，他们一年生产所得大多不能支持到明年麦收，灾重地区，甚至还维持不到年底。因此，我们认为这是某些领导同志对人民生活的认识缺乏实际调查——更确切的说是缺乏阶级生活的调查，因而减弱了对人民生计的责任心。这里就须要提醒各地领导同志，当我们计算年成的时候，应该是深入贫雇层，看看这些人的生活到底如何？不能只看一般平均数字，觉得还差不多而麻痹了自己。从计算群众的实际生活中，明显的告诉了我们：今冬如不大力发动生产，补足歉收，就会迫使群众将有限的粮食吃干耗净，结果会造成明年的严重灾荒，那时群众自顾不暇，广大贫雇陷于饥饿，这又势必造成未来工作上的极大困难，而明年的大生产运动亦更是不堪设想！
    最后号召大家，要为千百万人民生计负责，更直接的要为已经面临饥饿威胁的贫雇负责，领导者要清醒头脑，立即克服超现实的“等待”、“麻痹”思想，要面向实际，正视群众生活。重新审查自己的冬季生产计划，把他作为当前中心任务而贯澈下去。动员所有干部，继续发扬一年来抗灾增产的斗争精神，结合群众渡荒补窟窿的要求，掀起群众性的热烈的冬季生产运动，要从行动中进一步了解贫雇的实际生活，以便确实有效的解决其生产中的困难，使其达到增加收入，补上窟窿的目的。我们还要明确一个观念：今年的冬季生产能否取得成绩，已成为今后渡过灾荒及继续加强支援自卫战争的关键所在，也同样是为迎接将来的土改大复查之最有效的实际准备。
