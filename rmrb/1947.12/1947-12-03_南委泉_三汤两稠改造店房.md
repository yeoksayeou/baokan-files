　　Three Soups and Two Thick Dishes Transform Shops
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] The Nan Weiquan town in the Fifth District held a general meeting of the Businessmen's Association on the night of November 24th to discuss transforming shops for the purpose of transporting grain. Old Wei, a veteran (who runs a shop), said, "In order to support the front lines and dig up old roots, and to ensure that the grain transport laborers do not have difficulties, my shop will not sell noodles, but will sell thick rice porridge and yellow steamed buns, and rice soup. Borrowing pots to cook food is free of charge. They can also start a fire to cook, and using furniture is not a problem. I have ten stalls; grain transport livestock will occupy seven stalls, and guest livestock will occupy three stalls." Yue Shuizhen, a small food stall owner, said, "Three soups and two thick dishes will help each other (rice soup, noodle soup, tofu soup, thick rice porridge, yellow steamed buns) and will not let the laborers spend more money." The store cooperative proposed: In order for the laborers to return home with energy, we will not raise market prices. Everyone unanimously decided to transform on December 1st.

  　三汤两稠改造店房
    【本报黎城讯】五区南委泉镇，于十一月二十四日夜召开全体商联会会议，讨论为大运粮改造店房，退伍军老魏（开店）说：“为了支援前线刨老根，保证运粮民工不困难，我店不卖面，要卖稠饭黄蒸和米汤，借锅做饭不要钱，还要让他们起火做饭，使用家具不困难。我有十顶槽，运粮牲口占七顶，客人牲口占三顶”。小饭摊岳水珍说：“三汤两稠互助干（米汤、面汤、豆腐汤，稠饭、黄蒸）不叫民工多化钱。”商店合作社提出：为了民工捎回脚，不抬高市价。大家一齐决定十二月一日一律改造。（保法、建文、喜文、书田）
