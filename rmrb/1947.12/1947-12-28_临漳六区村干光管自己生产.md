　　【Report from Jinnan on the 26th of this month】The Sixth District of Linzhang held a district committee meeting on December 10th to study winter sideline production. First, they reviewed past deviations. Most of those engaged in sideline occupations were village cadres and militiamen, who did not lead the masses or even became detached from them. Specific manifestations included: (1) Village cadres engaged in trade, while their own livestock did not go on errands. For example, Guo Zhonghe, the chairman of the Xiangcaiying Farmers' Association, not only did not go on errands but also assigned errands in the village; (2) They used the Farmers' Association and public furniture, oil presses, cotton gins, etc., to make money for themselves; (3) They did not stand with the households that had been struggled against to engage in production together. For example, in the Xiangcaiying oil mill, there were two households that had been struggled against. Because of this, the masses said: "The public's can do it, but we can't!" "Our business is not the public's business!" The district committee has decided to immediately correct this serious phenomenon of detachment from the masses, to absorb a large number of poor people into sideline mutual aid, to use hired poor peasants as the backbone leadership, to expand production organizations under the principle of voluntarism, and to convene a meeting of village cadres from the entire district the following day (December 11th) to redeploy winter production.

　　临漳六区村干光管自己生产
    【本报冀南二十六日电】临漳六区，十二月十号召开区委会，研究冬季副业生产。首先检讨以往的偏向，凡是搞副业的，大部是村干、民兵，没带领群众，甚或脱离群众，且有如下具体表现：（一）村干做买卖，自己牲口不出差。如香菜营农会主任郭中和，不但不出差反倒在村中派差；（二）利用农会，公共家具、油榨、轧花车等，自己赚钱；（三）没立场和被斗户一块搞生产。如香菜营油坊中，就有两个被斗户。由于这样，群众则说：“公家的能干，咱可不能干！”“咱不是公家的买卖！”该区区委会已决定，立即纠正此种严重脱离群众的现象，大量吸收贫苦群众参加副业互助，以雇贫农为骨干领导，在自愿原则下，扩大生产组织，并于次日（十二月十一日）召开全区村干会，重新布置冬季生产。
