Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- Reports from various sources indicate that due to the failure of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's anti-people civil war, the industrial system of the Four Big Families' bureaucratic capital has fallen into crisis, reaping the bitter fruit of its own actions. Taking the Northeast as an example, the Chiang bandit authorities in the Northeast have seized 80% of the region's total industry, but 90% of that is now shut down. Bandit chieftain Chen Cheng also lamented at the Chiang bandit Northeast Headquarters' "Political Committee" meeting last month: "Taking the figures at the time of Japan's surrender as a base, the Northeast's industrial production was originally 9 million tons, but now it is only 1.25 million tons, accounting for about 14%; mineral production was originally 30 million tons, but now it is only 6 million tons, accounting for about 20%; power generation was originally 1.71 million kilowatts, but now it is only 210,000 kilowatts, accounting for about 12.8%." Among the heavy industries in the Northeast controlled by the Four Big Families, the few monopoly institutions still in operation are also facing crises. For example, the person in charge of Anshan Iron and Steel Company admitted last month: "If the coal allocation cannot be increased, the entire factory will be completely shut down within half a month. It is extremely difficult to decide what to do with the more than 13,000 employees." Jinzhou Datu River Paper Mill has already announced its closure. A paper shortage has formed in Shenyang, and Canadian newsprint has risen to 140,000 yuan (circulating currency) per ream. Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company is shut down for repairs and demolition. The "Resources Committee" China Petroleum Corporation has three factories in Taiwan, Jinxi, and Yumen. Although the Taiwan factory is said to be the largest in scale, its oil production can only supply the factories in Taiwan. The Jinxi factory faces numerous difficulties, while Yumen in the Northwest is "remote and inaccessible." The Liulihe and Jinxi factories of North China Cement Company are both feeling a deep sense of crisis. Sun Yueqi, vice chairman of the Chiang bandit Resources Committee, and Qian Changzhao, advisor, both lackeys of the Four Big Families, rushed to Shenyang in a panic at the end of last month. Sun expressed pessimism about the industries and mines in the Northeast, and confessed: "We can only follow the original plan and give another shot in the arm." Qian Changzhao stated in Beiping that the direction of the monopoly industrial activities originally decided by the Four Big Families, namely "Northeast first, Taiwan second, and North China third," has gone bankrupt due to the Chiang bandits' military failures in the Northeast and North China. He also revealed that the Four Big Families will further collude with foreign powers and sell out the country, selling industrial and mining resources to their American masters, shamelessly saying: "In order to maintain production ties with Japan, 'MacArthur' will not easily give up these resource areas in the Northeast and North China."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao of the Political Science Department on the 22nd of last month, the "Resources Committee," an industrial monopoly organization of the Four Big Families, has controlled the main industries in various parts of the Chiang bandit area, and is now continuing to step up its new plunder and expand its territory. Its North China Iron and Steel Company, which monopolizes the entire heavy industry in North China, was officially announced on the 24th of last month. Its business scope includes "Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, Longyan Iron Mine, and other factories and mines." The Chiang bandit government will also monopolize all Japanese reparations materials in order to establish a national shipbuilding industry monopoly. The "Resources Committee" will "set up a large-scale central shipyard in Shanghai"; the Ministry of Communications will "set up a ship repair and fitting plant in each of the five ports of Guangzhou, Taiwan, Qingdao, Tanggu, and Yingkou." Another report: Huaxin Cement Company, known as the largest in China, is under construction in Daye near Wuhan. The total capital of 22.5 billion yuan is invested by the financial monopoly institutions of the Four Big Families, including Central Bank, Bank of Communications, New China Trust and Savings Bank, and the local Yunnan bureaucratic capital's Fu Dian New Bank. It is said that: "Once the new factory is completed, all existing cement factories in various places will be crushed and unable to compete with it."

　　卖国反人民内战处处惨败
  　匪官僚工业体系破碎
  　东北蒋家工矿业十之九停闭
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据各方报导：由于蒋介石反动集团进行反人民内战的失利，四大家族官僚资本之工业体系已陷于危机，自食其恶果。以东北为例，东北蒋匪当局霸占了该地全部工业的百分之八十，但其中十分之九现已停闭。匪首陈诚于上月中蒋匪东北行辕“政委会”上亦哀鸣：“东北工矿以日本投降时数字为基准，工业生产原为九百万吨，现仅一百二十五万吨，约占百分之十四；矿业出产原为三千万吨，现仅六百万吨，约占百分之二十，发电力原为一百七十一万基罗瓦特，现仅二十一万基罗瓦特，约占百分之十二点八”。四大家族所控制东北重工业中，少数尚在开工的独占机构也面临危机，如鞍山钢铁公司负责人于上月中即供认：“用煤如不能增加配额，全厂半月内将全部停工，一万三千余员工如何发落，极感棘手”。锦州大涂河造纸厂已告停工。沈阳已形成纸荒，加拿大白报纸每令已涨到十四万元（流通券）。天津纸浆造纸公司则在修拆中停工。“资委会”中国石油公司共有台湾、锦西、玉门三厂，台湾厂虽称规模最大，但产油仅能供给台湾各厂之用。锦西厂困难重重，而西北玉门则又“道路遥阻”。华北水泥公司所有琉璃河、锦西两厂均感危机深重。四大家族看家狗蒋匪资委会副委员长孙越崎、顾问钱昌照于上月底均仓惶奔赴沈阳。孙对东北工矿表示悲观。并供称：“只有照原定计划，再打强心针”。钱昌照在北平表示，四大家族原先所决定的垄断工业活动之方向，即“东北第一、台湾第二、华北第三”，由于蒋匪在东北及华北的军事失败，已告破产。并透露四大家族将进一步媚外卖国，将工矿资源出卖给其美国主子，无耻地说：“为了与日本生产联系，“麦帅”也不会让东北、华北这些资源区域轻易放弃”。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据政学系之天津大公报上月二十二日泄露：四大家族工业垄断机构之“资源委员会”已控制蒋匪区各地主要工业，现继续加紧新的掠夺，扩充地盘。其所属垄断整个华北重工业之华北钢铁公司，已于上月二十四日正式宣告成立。其业务范围包括“石景山钢铁厂、天津炼钢厂、唐山制钢厂、龙烟铁矿及其他各厂矿单位”。蒋匪政府并将独吞全部日本赔偿物资，以建立垄断全国之造船工业，“资委会”将“在上海设置规模较大之中央造船厂”；交通部则将“在广州、台湾、青岛、塘沽、营口五埠设置船舶修配厂各一所”。另息：被称为中国最大之华新水泥公司在武汉附近之大冶兴建中，全部资本二百二十五亿元，由四大家族之金融垄断机构中、交、新华及云南地方官僚资本的富滇新等银行投资。据称：“新厂一旦完成，各地现有水泥厂将全被摧垮，无法与之竞争”。
