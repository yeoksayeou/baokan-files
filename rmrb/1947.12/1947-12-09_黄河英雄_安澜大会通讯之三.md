Yellow River Heroes
　　Newsletter Three from the Anlan Conference

　　On the morning of the 28th, after nine salutes, forty-nine heroes selected from more than three hundred were sent to the hero stage amidst the clamorous sounds of elegant music. Deputy Director Jia of the Administrative Office pinned flowers symbolizing the victory of the Yellow River struggle on the chests of the heroes. From each hero to each person attending the meeting, faces were filled with infinite joy of victory. The leading hero was Gao Chengfa. The people of Zhuxian County who repaired the Jin Dyke were very familiar with this forty-odd-year-old liberated peasant. The people building the dike on the Jin Dyke gave him the nickname "Half Cart of Earth." At the Anlan Conference, people still called him "Half Cart of Earth." During the dike restoration, he carried two large earth baskets, climbing from the bottom of the dike to the top. Each load weighed at least 180 to 200 catties. While others pushed a cart of earth, he carried two loads. Their group of five people carried at least twelve cubic meters of earth every day. At the peak of the dike restoration, he carried up to fourteen cubic meters of earth every day. (According to each cubic meter of earth weighing 3,000 catties. Before the war, when the Kuomintang led the Yellow River management, each person could only push two or three cubic meters of earth.) Gao Chengfa created the highest record of earthwork on the Jin Dyke. Knowing the financial difficulties of the public, he donated earth on the Jin Dyke without asking for public rice. Under his influence, the people of Zhuxian County saved 34,117 catties of rice.

　　People also talked about Jiang Juli, the thirty-odd-year-old first-class hero, nicknamed "Locomotive." He could push one cubic meter of earth with four carts, with each cart carrying over 700 catties. People at the Anlan Conference didn't believe he could push over 700 catties of earth, so they asked him to push it in person, and it weighed 740 catties. To push more earth at the dike construction site, he bought a new earth cart with five dou of wheat. When his 27-member shock team from Jiangmachang in the fifth district of Hua County competed with other villages, he pushed eighty-four carts in one go. He often said, "What's the big deal about contributing more to the country?"

　　People also discussed the story of a father challenging his son to a contest. Someone pointed to the fifty-two-year-old Lu Guangshan. He was from Dongzhuang in the eighth district of Yanggu. Although he was past the age for work, he and his son went as soon as dike repair was mentioned. Lu Guangshan was twice selected as a model stretcher-bearer. During the Yubei Campaign, he stayed on duty for four days and nights without changing shifts. During the conscription movement before wheat harvest, he shaved his beard to join the army, but everyone didn't let him go to the front line. When he issued a challenge to the entire district, no one dared to accept it. His son, Lu Dianming, was also an active earth pusher. He competed with the Farmers' Association chairman for three days, without a clear winner. He then started a contest with his father. After three days of fierce competition, Lu Dianming was finally defeated by his father. Today, the old hero Lu Guangshan is constantly smiling, and the big red flower on his chest is also smiling.

　　That sturdy young man in his mid-twenties is "Ivy," his real name is Yang Zhenzhu, from Dayangzhuang in the first district of Yunbei. He was once praised by the county and competed with eighty-three people. That fifty-nine-year-old hero, Xiong Baoshen, was one of the oldest in the group of heroes, but he looked much younger in the victorious and joyful atmosphere. He was the captain of the Pingyin section engineering team. During the Yellow River floods, the Kangkou dangerous section had three accidents. The enemy on the opposite bank frantically swept fire at the workers who were rescuing the dam. Although his leg was broken, the water was rapid and the dam was dangerous. Fearing that others would not be able to complete the task, he braved the sweeping fire from the opposite bank of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and arranged the fallen dam head with firewood and stones. The Kangkou dangerous section was rescued under the leadership of the old man, turning danger into safety.

　　That is an extremely simple and strong middle-aged woman, Zhao Zijin from Kunwu Third District, the instructor of Laomiao. When restoring the dike before the wheat harvest this year, she took three women to the dike. She competed with the men restoring the dike and pushed more than twenty carts of earth at once. After their village completed the work, they mobilized everyone to help Miaotun and Huazhuang with their work, which led to women in Kunwu County going to the dike.

　　Long Fengying, this young female hero, is the chairman of the Farmers' Association of Changmiao in Kunwu First District. When repairing the dike at that time, she let the village chief and militia captain work at home, and she carried two mats and took the laborers to the dike. After arriving at the dike, she also cooked and pushed earth like the men. She and the twenty-odd people from her village completed seven days' worth of tasks in four and a half days. ...

　　These heroes who defended the Yellow River also wore a Yellow River victory commemorative medal beside the big red flower on their chest. The camera is greedily capturing the portraits of these Yellow River heroes.

　　黄河英雄
  　安澜大会通讯之三
    二十八号的这天上午，九声礼炮响后，三百多英雄中被选出的四十九名英雄，为喧扬的雅乐声送上英雄台。行署贾副主任，将为黄河斗争的胜利花，插在众英雄的胸前，从每个英雄到每个参加开会人的脸上，都挂起了无限胜利的欢乐。为首的第一名英雄是高成法，筑先县修金堤的人们，对这位四十来岁的翻身农民是很熟悉的，在金堤上修堤的人们，给他起了个外号叫“半车土”，安澜大会上人们仍然喊他“半车土”，在复堤时，他挑着两个大土筐，从堤下爬到堤上，每担至少要挑一百八十斤到二百斤，别人用土车推一趟，他就挑两趟，他们那组的五个人，每人每天至少也要挑十二方土；复堤的最高潮中，他每天要挑到十四方土（按每方土合三千斤。战前国民党领导治河时，每人也只能推二、三方土。）高成法在金堤上创造了土工的最高纪录。他知道公家的财经困难，他在金堤上献土不要公家的米，筑先县的人民在他的影响下，节约了三四一一七斤米。
    人们又谈起了那个三十来岁的甲等英雄江聚厉，他的外号“火车头”，他四车能推一方土，一车推七百多斤，安澜大会上的人都不信他能推七百多斤土，别人当面叫他推了一下，称了称七百四十斤。为了到堤工上多推土，他用五斗麦买了个新土车到堤上去。他们滑县五区江马厂二十七个突击队，和别村比赛时，他一气推了八十四车子，他常谈说：“为国家多出点力，有啥？”
    人们又谈论起父亲挑战儿打擂的故事。一个人指着那个五十二岁的老头路广山，他是阳谷八区董庄人，虽然他已过了出工的年龄，一说修堤他爷俩个就去了。路广山是两次被选出的担架模范。豫北战役时，他曾四昼夜不换班；麦前参军运动时，他曾把胡子剃了去参军，可是大家不让他到前线去。当他向全小区里提出挑战时。没有一个敢和他应战的，他的儿子路殿明，也是积极推土的人，曾和农会长比赛了三天，不分胜负，他又与他父亲打起擂台来了，大战三天的结果，路殿明终于被他父亲战败了。今天老英雄路广山不断的笑着，他胸前大红花也在笑。
    那个二十五、六岁的结实青年，他就是“爬山虎”，他大号叫杨振珠，郓北一区大杨庄人，他曾经受过县的表扬，曾与八十三个人作过比赛。那位五十九岁的老英雄熊保身，在英雄群中，他的年纪是数一数二了，他在胜利愉快的气氛中，显得年轻多了。他是平阴段工程队队长，黄河大泛时，康口险工曾三次出险，对岸的敌人疯狂的向着这些抢救水坝的工人们扫射，他虽然腿被摔坏了，但当时水急坝险，他怕别人完不成任务，他即冒着对岸蒋匪的扫射，把跌下的坝头用柴枝和石头排好，康口险工毕竟在老人家的带头抢救下，转危为安了。
    那是个极其朴素而健壮的中年妇女，她是昆吾三区的赵子金，老庙的指导员，今年麦前复堤时，她带着三个妇女到堤上去，她曾与复堤的男人比赛过，她一次推过二十多车子土，他们村上完工后，曾动员大家帮助苗屯及华庄作工，自此引起了昆吾县的妇女上堤了。
    龙凤英，这位年轻的女英雄，她是昆吾一区长庙的农会长，当时修堤时，她让村长和自卫队长在家工作，她背着两张席带着民工上堤了。她上堤后，并且作饭，还和男人一样的推土，她带着她村上的二十多个人，四天半完成了七天的任务。……
    这些捍卫黄河的英雄，在他们胸前的大红花旁，又挂了颗黄河胜利的纪念章，照像机正在贪婪的摄下这些黄河的英雄们的肖像。
