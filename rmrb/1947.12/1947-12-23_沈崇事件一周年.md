The First Anniversary of the Shen Chong Incident
    Hu Maode
    On the evening of December 24th last year, American soldier Pierson raped a female student from Peking University in Dongdan Square, Beiping. On August 12th this year, the US government overturned the conviction of the rapist and declared him "not guilty." This act of bestiality, which insulted China's national dignity and shocked the world, profoundly exposed the true face of US imperialism's enslavement of China and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country like a scalpel.

    Over the past year, Chiang Kai-shek has been even more blatant in selling out China's sovereignty, and the Chiang-controlled areas have become even more thoroughly colonialized. A US military advisory group of 2,000 strong is stationed in Nanjing controlling Chiang's "Ministry of National Defense," directing Chiang's troops to carry out a counter-revolutionary civil war to slaughter the Chinese people. A large number of American "supervisors" are increasingly controlling all of Chiang's production, distribution, financial taxation, financial, foreign exchange, and even education and culture departments. American ships and planes are more rampant than before in China's territorial waters and airspace. Fully armed American troops can be stationed in any port, city, or street in the Chiang-controlled areas, can check pedestrians, and break into homes to make arrests. As a result, the atrocities of American troops such as rape, shooting, beatings, robbery, and military vehicles running over pedestrians have continued and even intensified in Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Taiwan, and other places over the past year. The degree of madness and cruelty far exceeds the persecution of the Chinese people by the Japanese invaders in the past. To cite a few examples, in early January of this year, American soldiers in Chongqing used jeeps in the suburbs to forcibly drag countless Chinese women to be gang-raped. On February 3rd, American soldiers at the Haihe Wharf in Tianjin fired nine shots, killing Liu Sibao, a worker who accidentally dropped a cargo box on the ground. In mid-March, American military police, together with Chiang's bandits, arrested more than 5,000 of our compatriots in Qingdao and 2,000 in Tianjin. On March 17th, West, a corporal of the American military police in Beiping, and others, shot more than ten rounds with automatic rifles, killing Wang Fengxi, a fourteen-year-old primary school student. On April 1st, American troops in Beiping test-fired artillery, killing and injuring six children. In mid-May, American military police in Shanghai assisted Chiang's police in arresting our patriotic students. On July 31st, American soldiers in Qingdao used electric shocks without authorization, injuring five Chinese workers. When they cried out in pain, the American soldiers applauded and cheered. On August 1st, American military police Alrui and Saifenni pushed our compatriots Wang Shouben and Ge Fadian into the water and drowned them for no reason. When they cried for help, the American soldiers laughed loudly. On September 20th, three American soldiers in Qingdao gang-raped Zhang Lihua, a seventeen-year-old girl, on the street late at night, causing her to fall into a coma and be on the verge of death. On November 6th, American soldiers in Nanjing regarded our compatriots as beasts, and used a shotgun to blind Li Guangfeng, a bricklayer, in his left eye, causing him to bleed and faint... With the connivance and protection of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek, American troops can arbitrarily massacre Chinese compatriots on Chinese territory. The blood of countless innocent compatriots is flowing on the humiliating land. This deep blood feud will forever be remembered in the hearts of the Chinese people.

    The Chinese nation is an unconquerable nation. The Chinese Communist Party and the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas have been fighting for two years to defend the motherland and end the rule of the murderers who enslave the Chinese people by the US-Chiang alliance. Over the past year, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas have also protested against the atrocities of the American troops and opposed US imperialist aggression through actions such as anti-violence demonstrations, parades, and boycotts of American goods. Only the national enemy Chiang Kai-shek, who sold out China's sovereignty two years ago and allowed the illegally stationed American troops to enjoy "extraterritoriality," once again shamelessly expressed "agreement" to the continued stationing of American troops in China in an open note on October 17th this year. He has always been servile and indulgent towards the atrocities of American troops, and has extremely cruelly suppressed and destroyed the just resistance and anger of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. After the American troop rape case in Beiping in December last year, Chiang's bandits immediately banned newspapers from publishing news, detained reporters from the Yaguang News Agency, and fabricated rumors and insults against Ms. Shen Chong, who had been persecuted by the American troops, and even beat her, attempting to force her to admit that she had "consented" to the relationship with the American soldier rather than being raped. Chiang's Executive Yuan suppressed the patriotic democratic movement that was raging at the time under the pretext of "insulting a friendly nation." On February 5th and 8th of this year, Chiang's bandits in Chongqing besieged and beat patriotic students who went to the countryside to promote resistance to violence. On February 9th, Chiang's bandits in Shanghai beat Liang Renda, an employee of the Wing On Company, to death at a meeting to "use domestic goods to offset American goods." In September, when Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, lost a wolfhound, Li Xianliang, the mayor of Qingdao under Chiang's control, immediately stepped forward to comfort and apologize, but turned a blind eye to the five Chinese people who were killed by American troops at the same time, allowing their bodies to rot in the hospital.... Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of flattering foreigners, betraying the country, and suppressing patriotic people have profoundly exposed his ugly face as a traitor to the nation.

    The situation of the compatriots in the Chiang-controlled areas under the trampling of the US-Chiang alliance is even more miserable than that of the colonial Philippines and the defeated Japan. Even the Filipino traitor Roxas made a pretense of protesting the atrocities of American troops in the Philippines, but Chiang Kai-shek is not even as good as Roxas! In August of this year, three soldiers of the US Eighth Army were sentenced to life imprisonment in Japan for gang-raping a young woman, Kanai; however, none of the bloody crimes committed by American troops in the Chiang-controlled areas over the past two years have ever been justly punished.

    The people in the Liberated Areas have already freed themselves from the enslavement of the US-Chiang alliance and any imperialist traitors, and are living a democratic and happy life. The people enjoy freedom from fear and a high degree of national self-esteem. On August 27th this year, an American plane invaded and landed on Xiaoli Island, Rushan County (newly established county, south of Muping, east of Haiyang) in the Jiaodong Liberated Area. Our army immediately detained the pilot of the plane, Winters. The next day, more than 60 fully armed American troops came to attack, and were repelled by our People's Liberation Army. On September 1st, the US military sent Navy Lieutenant Commander Goring Teng to request negotiations. Our democratic government severely condemned the US military for invading our airspace, territorial waters, and territory, and formally lodged a protest with the US military, demanding a written apology, compensation for losses, and a guarantee that similar atrocities would not occur in the future. Under the just attitude of our Chinese People's Democratic Government in defending sovereignty, the US military changed its arrogant attitude in the Chiang-controlled areas and bowed its head to admit its mistakes, fully agreeing to the demands of our democratic government and sending letters of apology from Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, and Admiral Helman, commander of the 71st Fleet under his command.

    This illustrates the extremely sharp contrast between Chiang Kai-shek's introduction of wolves into the house and massacre of the Chinese people over the past two years, his connivance and protection of the atrocities of the American troops, and the determination of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas to liberate the people and safeguard territorial sovereignty. These undeniable facts powerfully demonstrate that the Communist Party is a great patriot and the savior of the Chinese nation, while Chiang Kai-shek is a more shameless traitor than Wang Jingwei and an enemy of the Chinese nation.

　　沈崇事件一周年
    胡懋德
    去年十二月二十四日晚上，美军皮尔逊在北平东单广场强奸了北京大学的女生。今年八月十二日，美政府又复判了强奸犯“无罪”。这一侮辱中国国格，震惊世界的兽行，曾经象解剖刀一样深刻的揭露了美帝国主义奴役中国与蒋介石卖国的真面目。
    这一年来，由于蒋介石更明目张胆的出卖中国主权，蒋管区是更彻底殖民地化了。为数达二千之众的美国军事顾问团，在南京控制着蒋贼的“国防部”，指挥着蒋贼的军队进行反革命屠杀中国人民的内战。大批美国太上“监督”的日益控制所有蒋匪生产、分配、财政税收、金融、外汇以至教育文化等部门。美舰美机比前更猖獗的横行在中国的领海领空，全副武装的美军，可以在蒋管区任何港口、城市、街道驻扎布防，可以检查行人，闯入民宅进行逮捕。因而美军强奸、枪杀、殴打、抢劫、军事横行辗死行人等暴行，一年以来亦继续甚至变本加厉地在青岛、天津、北平、南京、上海、重庆、成都、台湾等各地不断发生。而其疯狂与残酷的程度，则远远超过以前日寇对中国人民的迫害。举几个例来说，今年一月初重庆美军以吉普在郊外强拉无数中国妇女前往轮奸。二月三日，天津海河码头美军，连发九枪击毙因失慎将货箱坠地的小工刘思宝。三月中旬，美宪兵会同蒋匪在青岛逮捕我同胞五千多人，天津二千人。三月十七日，北平美宪兵伍长威斯特等以自动步枪射击十余发，击毙十四岁小学生王凤喜。四月一日，北平美军试炮，死伤小孩六人。五月中旬，上海美宪兵协助蒋警逮捕我爱国学生。七月三十一日，青岛美军擅用电刑，伤害五个中国工人。当他们痛极呼号时，美军则鼓掌作乐。八月一日，美宪兵阿尔锐、赛芬尼无故推我同胞王守本、葛发田下水溺毙，当彼等呼救时，美军纵声大笑。九月二十日，青岛美军三人，深夜在街头轮奸十七岁少女张丽华，使其陷入昏迷濒死状态。十一月六日，南京美军视我同胞如野兽，以猎枪将砖瓦工人李光凤左眼打瞎，流血昏倒……。在汉奸卖国贼蒋介石纵容包庇下，美军可以在中国领土上恣意屠杀中国同胞，无数无辜同胞的鲜血汨汨的流淌在屈辱的土地上，这一笔血海深仇，将永远留志在中国人民心头上。
    中华民族是不可征服的民族。中国共产党与解放区军民，两年来正为保卫祖国结束美蒋奴役中国人民的杀人犯统治而斗争。而蒋管区人民一年来亦曾以抗暴示威游行、抵制美货等行动，抗议美军的暴行，与反对美帝国主义侵略。只有民族公敌蒋介石既于两年前出卖中国主权，容许非法驻华美军享有“治外法权”，今年十月十七日又再度以公开照会无耻表示“同意”美军留驻中国。并一贯奴颜婢膝对美军暴行纵容包庇，而对于蒋管区人民正义的反抗与愤怒则加以极度残酷的镇压与摧残。去年十二月北平美军强奸案发生后，蒋匪即禁止各报发表新闻，拘禁亚光通讯社记者，对于遭受美军迫害的沈崇女士则造谣侮蔑，甚至加以殴打，妄图压迫其承认与美军“和奸”而非被强奸。蒋匪行政院则以“有污友邦”罪名，镇压当时如火燎原的爱国民主运动。今年二月五、八两日，重庆蒋匪围殴下乡宣传抗暴的爱国学生。二月九日，上海蒋匪在“爱用国货抵销美货”会上，打死永安公司职工梁仁达。九月间，美西太平洋舰队司令柯克失了一条狼狗，蒋匪青岛市长李先良即趋前慰问道歉，而对同时间被美军杀害的五个中国人民则不闻不问，任其尸体在医院内腐烂……。蒋介石这些媚外卖国镇压爱国人民的罪行，深刻的暴露了他的汉奸卖国贼的丑恶面目。
    在美蒋蹂躏下的蒋管区同胞，其处境是比之殖民地菲律滨，战败国日本更为悲惨了。美军在菲律滨的暴行，还曾引起菲奸罗哈斯装模作样的抗议，而蒋介石则连罗哈斯也不如！今年八月间，美第八军士兵三人在日本轮奸少妇金井，被判处终身徒刑；而美军两年来在蒋管区血迹斑斑的罪行，从来没有一件受到正义的惩罚。
    解放区人民则已经摆脱美蒋及任何帝国主义卖国贼的奴役，过着民主幸福的生活。人民享有无所恐惧的自由及高度的民族自尊。今年八月二十七日，美机一架侵入并降落胶东解放区乳山县（新设县，在牟平南、海阳东）小里岛上，我军当即将该机驾驶员文特斯加以扣留，翌日，全副武装美军六十余人来犯，又被我解放军击退。九月一日，美军派遣海军上尉高凌腾前来要求谈判，我民主政府即就美军侵入我领空、领海、领土严加斥责，并正式向美军提出抗议书，提出书面道歉、赔偿损失、保证以后不再发生同样暴行等要求。美军在我中国人民民主政府保卫主权的严正态度下，一改其在蒋管区的骄横态度而低头承认错误，全部答应我民主政府要求，并送来美国西太平洋舰队司令柯克及辖下七十一舰队司令赫尔门的致歉书。
    这说明了两年来蒋介石引狼入室屠杀中国人民，对美军暴行的纵容包庇，与解放区军民解放人民维护领土主权的坚决，形成了极其强烈的对比。这些无可置辩的事实，有力的说明了共产党是伟大的爱国主义者，是中华民族的救星。而蒋介石是比汪精卫更无耻的卖国贼，是中华民族的公敌。
