Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Shanghai News: Although Chiang Kai-shek's Songhu Garrison Command's armed secret service continues to closely monitor the market, Shanghai's price increases continue to rise. On the 17th, the price of rice exceeded the one million mark, reaching 1.04 million per dan, an increase of 80,000 yuan. Other items such as grains, sugar, and oils also continued to rise. Public utilities, including trams, ferries, buses, water, electricity, and gas, have also stipulated that prices will increase monthly with the cost of living index starting next January. Under the continuous rise of prices, the broad masses of people have been severely threatened. From the 16th to the 18th, more than 100 impoverished people in Shanghai died of hunger on the roadside. The number of abandoned babies has also increased rapidly, with more than 130 infant corpses found in two days. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's Central Bank once again announced that the value of Chiang Kai-shek's currency continued to decline, and the public exchange rate for US dollars on the 19th rose from 73,000 yuan to 83,000 yuan. All parties pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's economic crisis is rapidly deepening with the arrival of the end of the year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Around the time when Chiang Kai-shek's authorities issued the 100,000 yuan note this month, they mobilized all their propaganda machines to defend Chiang Kai-shek's move. For example, the CC Clique's newspaper, the Shanghai Financial Daily, said: The issuance of large notes is to meet the needs of the market's lack of chips, and the issuance of 1 billion yuan in large notes is no different from the issuance of 1 billion yuan in small notes. However, Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of Chiang Kai-shek's National Economic Commission, revealed the secret of why Chiang Kai-shek's authorities wanted to issue 100,000 yuan notes in an interview with the Associated Press reporter in Nanjing on the 11th. He admitted that Chiang Kai-shek's inflation was rapidly approaching the point where even the cost of banknote paper could not be covered. He said that even issuing 10,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency was very uneconomical, because every time a 10,000 yuan note was issued, it would cost 7,000 yuan. Even the Financial Daily admitted in its editorial on the 11th that the current 10,000 yuan note is close to one jiao before the war, and said that the current price in Chiang Kai-shek's controlled area has risen to 100,000 times that before the war.

　　上海物价不断上涨大米每担百零四万
  　街头饿殍弃婴迅速增多
    【新华社陕北二十日电】上海消息：虽然蒋匪淞沪警备司令部武装特务继续严密监视市场，上海物价涨风仍一直向上发展，十七日大米价格已跃过百万元大关，每担高达一百零四万元，较前又涨高八万元之多。其他如谷物、糖类、油类也均继续高涨。公用事业包括电车、渡船、公共汽车、水电、煤气等亦已规定自明年元月起，将随生活指数每月加价。在物价不断高涨下，广大人民已受到严重威胁，自十六日至十八日两日内，上海已有一百余名饥寒交迫的贫民饿死路旁。弃婴数目也迅速增加，两日内共发现一百三十多个小孩尸体。同时蒋中央银行再度宣布蒋币币值继续低落，美汇十九日公开牌价已由七万三千元挂高至八万三千元。各方指出蒋匪之经济危机，正随着年关的到来而急剧加深。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】蒋匪当局在本月九日发行十万元大钞的前后，动员了它的一切宣传机关为蒋匪此举作辩护，如ＣＣ派报纸上海金融日报说：大钞的发行系适应市面筹码缺乏之需要，发行十亿元大钞与发行十亿元小钞并无不同。可是蒋匪全国经济委员会秘书长楼桐荪十一日在南京对合众社记者的谈话，却泄露了蒋匪当局为什么要发行十万元大钞的秘密，他承认蒋匪的通货膨胀已迅速地接近连钞票纸成本都抵不上的时候。他说，就是发行一万元的蒋币也已经很不合算了，因为每发行一张万元钞就得花费七千元的成本。就是金融日报在其十一日的社论中也承认：目前的万元钞，已接近于战前的一角钱，而是说目前蒋管区物价已涨至战前十万倍。
