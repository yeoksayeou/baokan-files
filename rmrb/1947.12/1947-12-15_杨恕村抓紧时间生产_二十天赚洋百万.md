[By our newspaper's Taiyue correspondent on the 13th] Yang Shu Village, Yangcheng, is seizing the time to organize winter production, earning a profit of one million silver dollars in twenty days. The leadership of Yang Shu Village attaches importance to winter production. On the 28th day of the ninth lunar month, village cadres held a meeting to study the matter, and have already organized the entire village into transportation teams, textile groups, and mobilized all kinds of skilled workers to transition into the winter production campaign. As a result, the entire village has earned a profit of over one million yuan in twenty days, with special consideration given to the production of hired laborers and the poor. The village has a total of five transportation teams with eighty people and fifteen head of livestock. During the first outing, they first selected the forty poorest laborers and all the livestock who had the most difficulty to go, while others waited at home for their turn. In twenty days, the forty people carried bowls and indigo from the local area to Wenxi and Yicheng, and then transported salt and cotton back, earning a total profit of 370,000 yuan. Among them, the poor peasant Zhang Bingwu earned 140,000 yuan. The livestock hauling also earned back 480,000 yuan. Eleven coal miners, each carrying coal an average of twenty times a day, earned over 100,000 yuan in twenty days. Eleven carpenters also earned over 100,000 yuan. Four cotton fluffers earned 30,000 yuan. Cotton ginning workers earned 12,000 yuan. The village's five major textile groups, with 257 people and 320 spinning wheels, have already spun more than 180 jin of cotton.
