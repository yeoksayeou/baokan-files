　　Yangcheng Sixth District
  　Organized Poor to Transport Salt, Earning Ten Million Yuan in Nine Days
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 18th] The Yangcheng Sixth District Production Committee, to resolve the production difficulties of the employed poor, organized over 900 employed poor households to transport salt, earning a profit of 13 million yuan in nine days. To resolve the production difficulties of the employed poor, the district's Production Committee specially dispatched district production member Guo Fengying to Xia County on the first of this month to purchase 110,000 jin of edible salt. After distributing 45,000 jin to the masses in the fourth district, they organized 990 employed poor households in the entire district to transport it back and forth for nine days, earning a total profit of 13 million yuan, which could buy 705 shi of millet, averaging 7 dou, 1 sheng, and 2 he per household. Their method of selecting and organizing the employed poor in each village was to have the masses in each mutual aid group assess who was the most impoverished, and let them go. The remaining able-bodied or semi-able-bodied people stayed at home to accumulate fertilizer and build pens in preparation for spring production; women devoted themselves to spinning and weaving. In Xijiao Village, the able-bodied employed poor all went to transport, while the impoverished and infirm orphans were organized into twelve "struggle objects" to produce for them.
