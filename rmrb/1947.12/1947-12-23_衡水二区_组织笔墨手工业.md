　　Hengshui Second District
　　Organizes Pen and Ink Handicraft Industry
　　[From our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 21st] Hengshui Second District, based on the different production conditions of the masses, has organized textile and pen and ink handicraft industries separately. In the eastern half, thirty villages are focusing on organizing textiles. The masses have dug fifty-two underground rooms, which can provide collective production for 1,240 textile women. Now the women are spinning yarn day and night in shifts. For example, in Beisumu Village, there are seven underground rooms, and the women are competing in production. The men who weave mats have also gone underground; the village cooperative provides poor women with cotton batting, without asking for money upfront, and asking for it after they earn money. Village cadres put forward the slogan: "Ensure that the masses in the whole village do not go hungry in the spring." The pen-making production in the eighteen villages in the western half has also been launched. In Da Zouchang and Dong Wukai River, village cadres have organized unemployed poor people into pen-making cooperatives, with more than twenty workers working collectively. There are more pen-making workers in Sanxinzhuang Village. During the spring, winter, and slack farming seasons, large and small workshops are always working early and late. During the Anti-Japanese War, only two or three workshops remained. After our government supported them, they have now increased to twenty-five, with eighty-four workers, who can produce 1,680 pens every day. There are thirty-six pen peddlers in the village, who often go to Cizhou, Handan, and even the Jin-Sui Border Region. Chen Guishan travels to and from Shunde, making a trip every twenty-six days, taking 10,000 pens and earning 50,000 yuan, bringing back 200 kilograms of ink, which can earn 80,000 yuan. Zhang Fujiang, an old man in his fifties, took 1,200 pens to Puyang to sell, and returned in twenty days, earning a net profit of 50,000 yuan excluding travel expenses. The masses say: "We are not afraid of a bad year, but we are afraid that the pens cannot be sold. As long as the liberated area expands, our lives will be no problem."
