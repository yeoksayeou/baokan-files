　　Hiring the poor who lack money and livestock
  　Xicun organizes them to carry loads and run workshops
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] Xicun in the third district of Tunliu is organizing the poor laborers who lack livestock and money to carry out winter production. The village has forty-four head of livestock. In addition to those participating in transport teams and militia, there are nearly one hundred full laborers (mostly hired poor). Because they have no livestock or capital, they cannot produce. The village production committee, in conjunction with the cooperative, provides appropriate assistance based on their labor situation, organizing various production activities. Currently, they have organized Liu Zehu and others to transport goods by carrying them on shoulder poles. For example, the hired poor Ren Shengyu and seven others have no capital, so the cooperative lends them oil to carry to Quwo to exchange for cotton and salt. The cooperative sells it for them. At the beginning, in order to take care of their difficulties with expenses, the cooperative, in addition to the oil price, did not charge any handling fees (according to the cooperative's task, it should support mass production and not charge any handling fees). This not only promoted the sale of local products, but also exchanged for necessities, allowing the hired poor to earn money. At the same time, Wang Lijin and three others were organized to carry soy sauce, with two carrying and two selling. The cooperative lent them one shi of rice as capital. Two tofu workshops were also opened, accommodating eleven people. They grind tofu and also feed pigs, which can both make money and accumulate fertilizer. Among them, Jia Baochun and five others, in addition to grinding tofu, are also organized to uncover kang beds for the masses. They have now contracted for more than thirty kang beds, which they uncover in their spare time. Three people were also organized to sell spoons, two to sell sugar cakes, and three to sell vegetable meals, and three small shops were opened, keeping people on hand to cook and sell food and drink. Production is still being organized, adhering to the principle of doing what one knows best, striving to keep everyone busy in winter and not letting anyone be idle.

　　雇贫缺钱无牲口
  　西村组织他们担挑搞作坊
    【本报太岳二十日电】屯留三区西村，组织没牲口没钱的雇贫进行冬季生产。该村有牲口四十四头，全半劳力除参加运输队、轮战队外，还有近百个全劳力（大部分是雇贫），因没牲口、没本钱不能生产，该村生产委员会协同合作社，根据他们的劳力情况，给予适当的帮助，组织各种生产，现已组织起刘则虎等人担挑运输。如雇贫任生玉等八人没有本钱，合作社即借给他油，担着到曲沃换回棉花食盐，合作社给他代销，一开始时，为了照顾他们没盘费的困难，合作社除得油价外，不收任何手续费（按合作的任务就是扶植群众生产，不该收任何手续费），这样既推销了土产，又换回必需品，雇贫也能赚钱。同时又组织王理金等四人担酱，两人担，两人卖，合作社借给他们一石米作本钱。又开了两座豆腐坊，容纳了十一个人，磨豆腐又喂猪，既能赚钱又能积肥。其中贾保春等五人，除磨豆腐外，又组织给群众揭炕，现已包下三十多个炕，抽空去揭。还组织了三个人卖杓子，两个人卖糖糕，三个人卖菜饭，并开了三个小店，留人起火卖吃喝。现仍在继续组织生产，根据会啥干啥的原则，争取做到冬季大家忙不让一人闲。
