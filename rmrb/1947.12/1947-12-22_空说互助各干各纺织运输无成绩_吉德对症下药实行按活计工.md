[Taoyueh News Agency, 20th] Yangcheng's Jide Village discovered that in their textile and transportation mutual aid groups, only Guo Xiaorui's group was actually helping each other; the rest were just empty formalities. The village cadres immediately convened everyone to study and rectify the textile and transportation groups. On November 7th, the entire village held a meeting to settle accounts for the formalism in textiles and transportation over the past month, prescribing the right remedy and establishing new methods of piece-rate work, grading work quality, and combining agriculture, sideline production, and participation in the war. For example, the Erli Yaoxi Village squad spent one month and five days on textiles, and each textile woman averaged less than one bolt of cloth. The reason was that they were not organized, everyone was doing their own thing, the time was dragged out, and they couldn't produce anything. Furthermore, they had not started by organizing hired poor women and lacked detailed methods for exchanging labor. The same was true for men's transportation; everyone was doing their own thing, and the results were not great. Moreover, transportation could not be combined with agriculture (carrying manure, etc.) or participation in the war, so they couldn't attend to everything. Therefore, everyone stipulated piece-rate work, such as carrying sixty catties to earn one full day's work, counted as ten points; carrying seventy catties earned two additional points, carrying fifty catties deducted two points, and the rest were increased or decreased accordingly. The money earned was distributed according to work points, and it was combined with agriculture. People at home did work for those who went out for transportation, earning wages according to the money earned by transportation each day. However, because transportation workers suffered on the road, it was stipulated that in addition to food and drink, they would also receive wages. Participation in the war gave transportation workers work points, also earning wages according to the money earned by transportation workers per day's work. The method for recording work points for textiles was four ounces of thread earning one day's work, weaving one bolt of cloth earning three days' work, and miscellaneous work such as sizing thread and winding thread earning one day's work for every two and a half bolts of cloth. The money earned was distributed according to work points. All fifty-four textile women in the squad were organized, starting with hired poor women. Some middle-peasant women who were willing to participate were also organized. In this way, mutual aid production did not disadvantage anyone, and the combination of agriculture, sideline production, and participation in the war ensured that nothing was neglected.

　　空说互助各干各纺织运输无成绩
  　吉德对症下药实行按活计工
    【本报太岳廿日电】阳城吉德村发现该村纺织运输互助组除郭小瑞组实际互助外，其余都是空有形式，该村干部即召集大家研究，整顿纺织运输组。全村于十一月七日开会，清算了过去一月来的纺织、运输的形式主义，对症下药，定出按活计工、按工批红，农（业）副（业）参（战）结合的新办法。如该村二里腰西庄分队，一月零五天的纺织，每个纺织妇女还平均不到一匹布，其原因是没有组织起来，各干各的，时间又拖的长，还做不出活来。另外是没有从组织雇贫妇女入手，没有精细的变工办法。男人运输也是一样，各干各的，成绩不大，而运输又不能与农业（担粪等）参战相结合，顾了这顾不了那。大家于是规定按活计工，如担六十斤顶一个全工，计十分，担七十斤加二分，担五十斤减二分，其余依次加减分数。赚下的钱按工分红，并与农业结合，在家的人给出外运输的做活，按运输每天所赚的钱赚工资，但因运输人路上苦，规定运输除吃喝外，再开工资。参战给运输人顶工，也是按运输人每工赚的钱赚工资。纺织的记工办法是纺四两线顶一个工，织一匹布顶三个工，浆线、缠线等零活每二匹半布顶一个工，赚下的钱按工分红。全分队五十四个纺妇都组织起来，首先从雇贫着手，一些愿参加的中农妇女也组织进来，这样互助生产各不吃亏，农业、副业、参战结合，什也误不了。
