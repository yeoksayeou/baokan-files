    (This newspaper Taiyue 9th dispatch) Gao Yunting from Yuancun, Tunliu, and his entire family are working hard on winter production, striving for another harvest. After the hero symposium, Gao Yunting returned home overnight. The next day (November 21st), he convened a family meeting. Old Gao excitedly pointed to the large silk flag with a green border and a red heart and said, "How beautiful! This is what the Yuebei Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office awarded us for our good production and effective methods. We all earned this. Now that we have this flag, what should we do in the future?" Everyone said in unison, "Work! Work! We must work especially hard in the future." Then, Old Gao called on the whole family, "We must reap another harvest this winter. The government is calling for spinning ten jin of cotton, and we are models, so we must spin fifteen jin." So everyone made plans. The four daughters-in-law, besides having children to care for and cooking, were willing to work from dawn till dusk, each completing fifteen jin, for a total of sixty jin, which could earn eight shi and five dou of corn. The eldest son weaves an average of fifteen bolts of cloth per month, earning another nine shi and five dou of corn in three months. The third son specializes in transporting coal, and excluding participation in battles and snowy weather, it is estimated that he can earn fourteen shi of corn in two months. Excluding the consumption of people and animals, the winter production can earn a total of thirty-two shi of corn. Old Gao himself, in addition to promoting work in his village, is responsible for accumulating 420 dan of fertilizer. Currently, everyone is actively completing their plans. The second daughter-in-law, holding her child who is less than a week old, has already spun one jin and two liang of cotton in seven days. After a family meeting, it was already late, but they still turned on the lights and rushed to spin cotton. The sixth son was sick for two days. As soon as he got up, he wove two bolts of cloth in three days. The third son has already earned 6,000 yuan in foreign currency by hauling coal.
