　　【Report from our newspaper in Huang He Nan, Hebei-Shandong-Henan】 The Second District south of the Yellow River has victoriously persisted in guerrilla warfare for the past year. This district has seen three major seesaw battles in the past year. After the Chen-Su troops launched an offensive into Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Anhui, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits only left three strongholds in the Second District: Juan, Yun, and Ju. Chiang Kai-shek's Liu Ruming's 119th Brigade was trapped in Juancheng, while the puppet bandit Wu Huawen guarded Yuncheng and Juye. After the 356th Regiment of the 119th Brigade revolted in Juancheng, the 355th Regiment was annihilated in Juancheng on October 2nd. The enemy in Yuncheng, hearing the news, fled to Juye on the 3rd. When our Chen-Su troops launched an offensive on Longhai this time and recovered Dangshan, the puppet bandits in Juye hurriedly fled to Jinxiang. From then on, all six counties of our Henan Second District, including Juancheng, Yuncheng, Juye, Yunbei, Linze, and Yunju, were liberated. In the struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for the past year, we have achieved brilliant victories. According to the seven-month battle statistics of the Second District's local corps, county brigades, militia, and armed work teams, a total of 1,422 battles were fought, capturing 3,341 enemies, killing and wounding 4,072 enemies, seizing one airplane, 18 vehicles, 20 82mm mortars and 60mm guns, six grenade launchers, seven heavy machine guns, 69 light machine guns, 2,290 rifles and carbines, 14 Thompson and Canadian submachine guns, 77 pistols, 175,835 rounds of various bullets, 1,779 rounds of various shells, 1,838 hand grenades, 100 warhorses, 28 bicycles, 11 telephones, 254,800 catties of grain, and 40,428,880 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency.
