Huguan Zuoquan Workers Gather to Study Winter Coal Industry Production Increase
[Huguan News from Our Newspaper] Huguan convened a meeting of all county coal industry workers on the 7th of this month to study winter production increase issues. It was discovered that some kilns had unequal profit distribution, and some kiln leadership compositions were impure. For example, in the Xibailin Wugushan Kiln, out of ten workers, leadership was held by the three brothers of the landlord Hua Xingdi, such as Dui Jin. They did not go down the kiln when the sun came up, and the masses often returned empty-handed without getting any coal; in the two coal kilns in Xiahaolao Village, thirty-five workers shared profits equally regardless of technical skill; in the Huangshan Kiln, people could work as much as they wanted, and no one could manage anyone. After discussion, everyone clarified that only poor and hired peasant leadership could improve the kilns. As Li Zhonglian said: "The kiln used to belong to the landlords, now we have struggled and won it back, let the landlords suffer, the middle peasants are afraid of causing trouble, only our leadership can do a good job." They also studied an equivalent profit distribution method and launched a campaign to respect teachers and love apprentices. Finally, a challenge was issued, stipulating monthly inspections and annual summaries.

[Another News] After the Huguan Second District coal kilns squeezed out feudal elements from the leadership, the number of workers going down the kiln increased from 206 to 329. Five kilns added night shifts, and the remaining kilns were transformed from manual winches to shift kilns. Daily coal production increased from 4,750 baskets to 8,600 baskets, and the daily output of five charcoal kilns increased from 900 baskets to 1,700 baskets. From the 2nd to the 10th of this month, in nine days, a total of over 9.28 million yuan was earned, and the daily income of workers going down the kiln increased from 23 jin of rice to 30 jin. Winch workers earned an average of 8.5 jin of rice per day. (Pi Zhen, Jin He, Bao Xing, You Hao, Yu Dan)
[Left Power News from Our Newspaper] More than fifty coal miners in the third district of Zuoquan gathered to discuss increasing production. Li Jintian said on the spot: "I have been working in the kiln all my life. Today I have turned over. The past is very different from the present. In the past, when winter came, nine landlord families carried coal for one kiln. Each family carried at least 15 loads a day, and the nine families carried a total of 135 loads. The most coal produced in a day was 400 loads, and they carried more than a quarter of it. The remaining families were divided into shares in various ways, and the poor were left with nothing." An old man named Li Laijin said: "I have lived for more than sixty years and have never experienced such a world. I must go down to the kiln and work hard."

　　壶关左权工人集会研究冬季煤业增产
    【本报壶关讯】壶关于本月七号，召集全县煤业工人开会，研究冬季增产问题。发现有些窑分红不均，有些窑领导成份不纯，如：西柏林五谷山窑，十个工人，领导权在化形地主堆金等弟兄三人手里，太阳上来不下窑，群众时常拉不上煤空返走；下好牢村两座煤窑，卅五个工人，不分技术高低一样分红；黄山窑想多会干就多会干，谁也管不了谁。以上问题经过讨论，大家明确只有贫雇领导，才能把窑搞好。如李中莲说：“窑过去是地主的，现在咱们斗争回来，让地主给咱受，中农怕惹人，非咱们领导才能搞好。”又研究出等价分红办法，开展尊师爱徒运动。最后进行挑战，规定一月检查一次年底总结。

    【又讯】壶关二区煤窑挤出封建改造领导后，下窑工人由二百零六个增到三百二十九个，有五座窑增加夜班，其余窑都由客绞把转成班窑，日产煤由四千七百五十篓，增到八千六百篓，炭窑五座日产量由九百篓，增到一千七百篓，本月二日至十日九天共赚洋九百二十八万余元，下窑工人由一日收入二十三斤米增至三十斤。绞把工人日赚米平均八斤半。（丕珍、金和、保兴、有好、于丹）
    【本报左权讯】左权三区五十余煤矿工人集会，讨论多增产，当场有李金田说：“我下了一辈子窑，今天翻了身，想过去比现在大不相同，咱过去一到冬天，一座窑九家地主担煤，一家一天至少担十五担，九家共担一百三十五担，一天最多上四百担煤，人家就担了四分之一还多。留下的人家这样股那样股一分，轮到咱穷人就完了。”有一位老汉李来金说：“我活了六十多，没经过这样的世道，可得下窑好好干。”
