　　Xing and Xi Jointly Praise the Opening of the Road: Materials Flow Smoothly Between Mountains and Valleys
    [Report from Xingtai] In order to develop winter production and facilitate transportation, the Xingtai County Committee decided to build the Xingda Cart Road. The Taihang Administrative Office has allocated 700 *shi* (石, a unit of dry measure) of grain (corn) as a work-relief program to support the construction. The plan is divided into two sections. The lower section is 70 *li* (里, a Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters) long and requires 15,000 workdays. The upper section is 20 *li* long and one *zhang* (丈, a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters) wide, requiring 13,000 workdays. Xing and He counties discussed jointly building the road, planning to complete it in thirteen and a half days. Starting on October 1st, the masses spontaneously started early and worked late,不怕天冷, competing to be the first, and as a result, completed the thirteen-and-a-half-day plan in ten days, saving more than 1,000 workdays. It is now fully completed and can be officially opened to traffic (Lu'an carts climb mountains). East from Poziyu through General's Tomb and Songjiazhuang, it can reach Xingtai City. West from Dongpinggou, it connects Hes順城cheng. North, it connects Qingcheng Coal Mine. The masses are rushing to repair carts, preparing to transport mountain coal, grain, and hemp skin to exchange with mountain cotton and homespun cloth. (Wang Yu)
    [Report from Xiyang] A road from Dongyetou in Xiyang to Zanhuang has a section called Huangshaling, which used to be a very narrow path, making transportation inconvenient. This road is not only a transportation line from Xiyang to Zanhuang, but also an important route for traffic to and from Jingxing, Pindin, and other counties. At the request of the masses, the Administrative Office specially allocated 1,000 *shi* of grain to help the masses build the road. The masses in the fourth and seventh districts spontaneously mobilized and combined construction with harvesting, using a total of more than 20,000 workdays. It is now able to accommodate carts, which is very beneficial for winter transportation in Xiyang, Zanhuang, Pingding, Jingxing, and other counties. (Kou Cheng, Hui Lan, Mang Xiao)
