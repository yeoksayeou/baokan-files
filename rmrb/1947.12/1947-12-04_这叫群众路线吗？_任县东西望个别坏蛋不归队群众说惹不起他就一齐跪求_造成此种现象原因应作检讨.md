Is This Called the Mass Line?
    In Ren County, Some Bad Eggs in Dongxiwang Refuse to Return; The Masses Say They Can't Afford to Offend Them, So They All Kneel and Beg
    The Reasons for This Phenomenon Should Be Examined

    [Report from our newspaper in Ren County] Under the slogan "Fight to Nanjing, Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive," Ren County carried out a return-to-the-army movement. In the beginning, some villages, such as Zhangtai and Jiuzhou, the village cadres were eager to achieve success. On the first day they accepted the task, and on the second day they detained the runaway soldiers and sent them to the return-to-the-army camp. After examination, because the mobilization was immature, they were still called back to the village to continue working, to persuade them, and to get their thinking straight. At the same time, the *xiaobao* [small newspaper] closely cooperated, pointing out that acute illness is not desirable, and emphasizing: "Whether the return-to-the-army task is completed or not depends on whether the masses are mobilized and whether the mass line is followed." After reading the *xiaobao*, the village cadres also read it at the mass meeting. The village cadres handed over the task to the masses, believed in the power of the masses, and asked the masses to reason with the runaway soldiers and solve the specific problems of each person so that they would return to the army voluntarily. Wujiazhuang Village in the Second District did the most beautifully. When the mobilization began, only the village cadres took action. Village cadre Comrade Xu Zanting pointed out that this would not complete the task, and it was necessary to divide the citizens into groups and ask the masses to mobilize. At first, the masses were a little afraid, but later they were not afraid. Hou Xingwei refused to return and spoke badly, saying to the masses: "I'll call you to come to my house to mourn!" But the masses were not anxious. They went to reason with his father in shifts. This one went, and that one went. When that one came out, this one went in again. They persuaded him day and night, and persuaded him in a cycle. As a result, his thinking was straightened out, and he agreed to return to the army. In Dongxiwang Village, some bad eggs refused to return, wanting to kill the dog [a local expression for refusing to cooperate]. The masses said: "We can't afford to offend you, we're afraid of you, let's kneel to them!" Several old men led more than thirty people to kneel down. The masses said: "People have faces, trees have bark, please have mercy!" (This is an insult to the masses—Editor). They couldn't stand such stimulation, shed tears, and immediately returned to the troops. Sun Qishan and two others from Xiaowangzhuang Village heard about the return to the army and ran away. The masses said, "The monk can run away, but the temple can't run away." So they went to his house to mobilize. The children's corps and sisters' group sang anti-desertion songs in his house. Everywhere in the yard, in the house, on the ground, on the kang, on the chairs, and on the tables, there were children. The farmers' association and militia persuaded his father and mother. As a result, he saw that he could not exist in the village, so he had to bow his head, admit his mistake, and swear to return to the army. (Hui Wen)

　　这叫群众路线吗？
    任县东西望个别坏蛋不归队群众说惹不起他就一齐跪求
    造成此种现象原因应作检讨
    【本报任县消息】在“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”的口号下，任县进行了归队运动。开始有几个村庄，如张台、旧州等村干，急于求功，第一天接受了任务，第二天便把逃亡战士扣起送往归队营。经检查后，因动员不成熟，仍叫回村再做工作，进行说服，打通思想。同时小报也紧密的配合着，指出急性病要不得，并着重说明：“归队任务完成不完成，就在会不会发动群众，走不走群众路线。”村干读了小报以后，又在群众会上读。村干们把任务交给了群众，相信了群众力量，叫群众去和逃亡战士讲理，解决每一个人的具体问题，自动归队。二区吴家庄村搞的最漂亮，当开始动员时，只是村干动手，坐村干部徐赞廷同志指出这样完不成任务，必须划分公民组，叫群众去动员，最初群众有点害怕，后来不怕了，侯杏卫不归队，说坏话，对群众说：“叫你们到俺家中吊孝吧！”但群众不着急，分班去和他父亲讲理，这个去了那个去，那个出来又是这个进去，日夜劝说，循环劝说，结果思想打通了，答复归队。东西望村有个别坏蛋不归队要死狗，群众说：“惹不起你怕你，咱给人家跪下吧！”几个老头领着三十多名群众跪下了，群众说：“人有脸树有皮，你们恩典恩典吧！”（这是对群众的一种侮辱——编者）他们受不住这样的刺激，流出了泪，马上回到部队中去。小王庄孙奇山等两人听到归队偷跑了，群众说，跑了和尚跑不了寺，到他家去动员，儿童团、姊妹团，在他家唱反逃亡歌，院里屋里、地上炕上、椅子上、桌子上，到处都是孩子，农会民兵就劝说他父亲、母亲，结果他看在村中不能存在，只好低头认错宣誓归队。（悔纹）
