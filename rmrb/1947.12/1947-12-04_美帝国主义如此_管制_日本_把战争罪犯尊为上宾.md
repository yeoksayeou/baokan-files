　　U.S. Imperialism so "Controls" Japan
    Treating War Criminals as Honored Guests
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Tokyo Dispatch: Keenan, the American Chief Prosecutor of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, once invited Japanese fascists to a cocktail party, treating them as honored guests. The four invitees were former Japanese Minister of the Army Ugaki and former Japanese Prime Ministers Wakatsuki, Yonai, and Okada. When a reporter asked Keenan why he was hosting the banquet, Keenan brazenly replied, "These people have all worked for peace domestically and should be respected." Afterwards, Keenan forbade Tokyo newspapers from publishing the news. Note: The above four people are all principal culprits in Japan's launch of the war of aggression.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Tokyo Dispatch: According to well-informed sources in Japan: U.S. imperialism will continue to give the reactionary Japanese government a credit loan of 1.05 billion U.S. dollars. The Japanese government had previously requested a credit loan of 850 million U.S. dollars from the United States as a fund for purchasing grain and importing other relief supplies over a three-year period. At the same time, an additional credit loan of 200 million U.S. dollars was requested to purchase ships from the United States in order to develop Japan's shipping industry.

　　美帝国主义如此“管制”日本
    把战争罪犯尊为上宾
    【新华社陕北二日电】东京讯：远东国际军事法庭检查长美人季南，曾邀请日本法西斯分子参加鸡尾酒会，尊为上宾。被邀四人系前日本陆相宇垣及前日本首相若、米内、冈田等人。当某记者询问季南因何理由设此宴会时，季氏竟丧心病狂答称：“此诸人均曾在国内努力和平，理应尊重。”事后季氏并禁止东京各报登载该项消息。按：上述四人均属日本发动侵略战争之主犯。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】东京讯：据日本消息灵通人士宣称：美帝国主义将继续给日本反动政府十亿五千万美元之信用贷款。日本政府前曾向美国要求八亿五千万美元之信用贷款，作为三年期间购买粮食及输入其他救济物资之基金。同时额外要求二亿美元之信用贷款，俾向美国购买船只，以发展日本航业。
