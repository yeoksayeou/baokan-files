Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, December 27th: After the liberation of Xuchang, the People's Liberation Army immediately announced and implemented a policy of protecting and developing national industry and commerce. In addition to confiscating the branches of the four major banks – Central, China, Communications, and Farmers – established in the city by the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families, the PLA immediately returned to their original owners the vehicles of private companies such as Heji Company that had been forcibly requisitioned by the Chiang bandits. Relief was also provided to merchants who suffered heavy losses in the fighting. The People's Liberation Army, in cooperation with the democratic government, established a currency exchange to stabilize and circulate finance. Therefore, on the day of Xuchang's liberation, shops and stores immediately opened for business. Cultural items such as fountain pens and ink from the Xuchang branch of the Zhonghua Book Company were particularly popular. A clerk at the store said: Purchases from the 15th to the 20th reached over 1 million Northern Sea currency, equivalent to nearly 30 million Chiang currency, whereas before liberation, the average daily income was less than 1 million Chiang currency. The discipline of the People's Liberation Army in fair buying and selling has been praised by all merchants and citizens. Many shop owners, clerks, and citizens are grateful for this liberation, which saved them from paying the 10 billion "rich household donation" that the Chiang bandit authorities in Xuchang were about to forcibly collect. Xuchang was originally a nationally renowned tobacco distribution center, with over a hundred cigarette shops and tobacco firms. However, due to the dumping of American goods in recent years, they have successively closed down, leaving tens of thousands of merchants and citizens displaced and unemployed. Huamin Pharmacy, located on South Main Street, had an average daily income of only 1 million in November, but paid over 10 million in various donations and taxes that month, as well as 4,000 catties of wheat. The cloth of the Far East Cloth Store on South Main Street was also completely looted by the Chiang bandits. Before the liberation of Xuchang, Xuchang businesses resisted the devastation of the Chiang bandit authorities' exorbitant taxes and levies by suspending operations.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, December 28th: In liberated Xuchang, the market and finance are stable, and the prestige of the Northern Sea currency in the liberated areas is extremely high. In order to facilitate the flow of funds for merchants and citizens and to supply low-priced food, the Fifth Administrative Office of the Yu, Wan, and Su Border Region established an exchange in the city on the 18th, stipulating that every 100 Northern Sea currency could be exchanged for one sheng (equal to one and a half jin) of wheat, with even more favorable exchange rates for vendors. Within three days, 750,000 Northern Sea currency was exchanged. Many vendors, after selling fried dough sticks and peanuts, took home baskets full of wheat. The manager of a large business said: "The democratic government cares for the interests of the people in every possible way, and its highly responsible attitude towards the currency it issues is something he has never seen in his 30 years of business." Citizens regard Chiang currency with a face value of less than 5,000 yuan as waste paper. On the day after Xuchang's liberation, in front of the "Henan Bank" on South Main Street, Chiang bandit banknotes were scattered all over the ground and no one picked them up. There were also many 500-yuan Chiang banknotes used as toilet paper in various toilets.

　　我军保护发展民族工商业
  　许昌市面金融稳定比解放前繁荣得多
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十七日电】许昌城解放后，解放军立即公布和执行保护发展民族工商业政策，除将蒋宋孔陈四大家族分设于该城之中央、中国、交通、农民四大银行的支行予以没收外；对被蒋匪强迫征用的民营合记等公司的汽车，均即发还原主，对在战斗中损失较重的商贩，均予救济。解放军协同民主政府设立货币兑换所，以稳定与流通金融，故许昌解放之当日，商店铺家即开市营业。中华书局许昌分店水笔、墨水等文化用品尤为畅销。该店店员称：从十五至二十日买货达北海币百余万元，折合蒋币近三千万元，而解放前平均每日收入不足蒋币百万元。解放军买卖公平的纪律，商民莫不有口皆碑，许多店主、店员、市民皆庆幸此次获得解放，得免缴纳许昌蒋匪当局即将强征之一百亿元的“富户捐”。许昌原为全国弛名的烟叶集散地，有卷烟店及烟行百余家，自年来美货倾销，皆已相继倒闭，成万商民流离失业。开设南大街的华民药房，十一月份每日平均收入不过百万元，是月各种捐税即缴纳一千余万元及麦子四千斤。南大街远东布店布匹亦为蒋匪全部抢光。许昌解放前，许昌商号均以停业方法反抗蒋匪当局横征暴敛之摧残。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十八日电】解放后的许昌，市场金融稳定，解放区北海币威信极高。豫皖苏边区第五专署为便利商民资金流转，及供应低廉食粮，于十八日起在市内设立兑换所，规定每百元北海币兑小麦一升（合一斤半），小贩兑换更受优待，兑价比市价便宜一半，三日内即兑换北海币七十五万元。许多小贩卖完油条、花生后，即携满筐小麦回家。某大商号经理称：“民主政府爱护人民利益，无微不至，而对其所发行货币之高度负责精神，为他经商卅年来所未见。”市民视票面五千元以下之蒋币为废纸，许昌解放之次日，南大街“河南银行”门前，蒋匪钞票满地而无人拾取，各厕所内亦常有很多五百元蒋币作了大便纸。
