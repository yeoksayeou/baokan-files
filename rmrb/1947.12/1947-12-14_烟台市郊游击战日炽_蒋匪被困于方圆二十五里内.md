Xinhua News Agency, East China, December 12th. Guerrilla warfare in the suburbs of Yantai is intensifying. In November, according to incomplete statistics, there were more than 40 battles of varying sizes. The enemy has been compressed within a 25-li radius and the enemy troops entrenched in the city rely entirely on maritime transport for supplies. The defeated morale of Chiang Kai-shek's troops is increasing daily. Following Xie Guizhao's company uprising, 25 soldiers defected to the People's Liberation Army within seven days.
