This summer, after the Jinan Campaign, he was honorably promoted to squad leader. In the Battle of Wenxi, he led his entire squad to complete the combat plan, earning another commendation. He was heroically wounded in the Battle of Yuncheng. While recuperating in the hospital, he not only adhered to hospital regulations himself but also helped to change the emotions of other convalescing soldiers, thereby earning a Special Merit in the hospital. After participating in the great counter-offensive this time, the squad he led demonstrated an immeasurably tough-bone spirit in the Battle of Shangtunyuan. The entire squad was awarded a Collective First-Class Merit, and he himself was awarded a Special Merit. The leadership believes that Comrade Li Buzhou is an outstanding soldier loyal to the cause of the people's liberation, and he has been specially promoted to deputy platoon leader.

    在南征中无比英勇
    李步周升任副排长
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十二日电】著名战斗英雄李步周在南征中荣升副排长，他在三十四年参军后，每战必立功。前年十二月一日赵城战斗，是他入伍后第一次参加战斗，他就杀敌一名，缴枪一枝。去年七月自卫战争开始，晋南下时一战，他机智勇敢的逼着一百七十余名蒋军缴了枪。二次打赵城时又迫令一个碉堡的敌人放下了武器。吕梁战役后，他被记了特功，今夏晋南战役后，荣升班长。闻喜一战，带领全班完成战斗计划，又记了功。运城战斗中英勇负伤，到医院修养时，他不但自己遵守院规，而且帮助转变了休养员的情绪，因而在医院记了特功。此次参加大反攻后，他所领导的班，在尚屯垣战斗中表现了无比的硬骨头作风，全班记了大功，他本人记了特功。领导上认为李步周同志是忠实于人民解放事业的优秀战士，特提升为副排长。
