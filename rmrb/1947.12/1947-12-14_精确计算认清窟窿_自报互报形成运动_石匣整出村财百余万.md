    Accurate Calculation Reveals Shortcomings
    Self-Reporting and Mutual Reporting Forms a Movement
    Stone Box Township Clears Out Over a Million in Village Finances
    [Report from this newspaper in Zuoquan] Stone Box Township's financial rectification had already achieved some success in the previous period, clearing out items worth over 70,000 yuan. At this point, some people felt that it was almost enough, and there wasn't much left to rectify. The leadership first dispelled the muddled thinking among cadres and the masses and launched a mass self-aware financial rectification movement. The methods were as follows:
    1. Clarify the purpose of financial rectification and dispel ideological concerns. For example, some people said, "This spring's 'relationship rectification' made me dizzy and scared. Now we have to rectify finances again, and I don't know what it will be like!" After understanding these concerns, it was repeatedly explained that financial rectification not only supports the great counter-offensive, unearths old problems by straightening out finances, and increases our ability to get through the famine and make up for deficiencies, but also is an important task for reducing our own burdens. Only when the masses felt that it was beneficial to them would they become active. Secondly, letting the masses discuss and clarify that financial rectification is not about opposing corruption, and that personal self-reporting is not a disgrace. The items that are rectified belong to the village and are for the village's use.
    2. Calculate the big picture and the small details, see the shortcomings clearly, and rely on the poor and hired peasants to lead everyone in finding and repairing the flaws. After dispelling ideological concerns, the next step was to start with calculating the big and small accounts, so that the masses could understand where their money had gone. After Stone Box Township calculated the farmers' burden account for last year, the masses all said, "We keep saying the burden is heavy, but now it's clear that the burden isn't heavy, but rather the village's miscellaneous expenses are heavy. We must straighten out the finances so that the village can be self-sufficient, and we will be able to contribute even more to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets." (Editor's note: Attention should be paid to overcoming waste.) In the calculations of typical households, the poor and hired peasants generally paid less grain and funds, but the village's various expenses exceeded those of the middle peasants. For example, the poor peasant Niu Cunxi only paid 12.5 jin of border grain rice and 356 yuan of border funds last year. The village temporarily mobilized donations: 5 jin of rice for the school, 9 jin of rice for repairing the bridge, 500 yuan for four opera performances, 1.1 jin of rice for blind people's propaganda, 200 yuan for joining the army, 1.5 jin of rice for the village office, 150 yuan for the Lantern Festival, 100 yuan for supporting the army, and 50 yuan for the farmers' association, totaling 17 jin of rice and 1,000 yuan. This exceeded the border grain by 4.5 jin of rice and 650 yuan. Last year, the middle peasant Song Shouyin paid a total of 370 jin of millet for border grain and 1,300 yuan for border funds. The village temporarily mobilized donations totaling 118.5 jin of rice and 2,370 yuan. This was just half of the border grain rice, but the funds exceeded it by 1,070 yuan.
    After calculating the accounts of typical households, everyone said, "Oh! So the money I paid all went to the village." In particular, the poor and hired peasants felt the importance of financial rectification even more. At this time, relying on the poor and hired peasants, a financial rectification team was formed. They then visited elderly people and united the middle peasants, achieving very good results.
    3. Think about yourself, think about others, think about the whole village, report yourself, report each other, creating a movement. After everyone had an active desire for financial rectification, they were mobilized to first think about whether they had any public property, promoting setting an example. In addition to reporting themselves, they also thought about others and the whole village, reporting on others and reporting on the whole village. In this way, some people who wanted to hide things couldn't hide them, fearing that others would report them and they would lose face. Everyone was investigating themselves and investigating others. In six or seven days, the teams reported and the general meeting reported. Some people even reported a single tile or brick. A total of various materials were sorted out, amounting to 1,148,521 yuan. After discussion by all the farmers, most of it has now been invested in appropriate production avenues, and the village's expenses are being made self-sufficient.

### 精确计算认清窟窿  自报互报形成运动  石匣整出村财百余万

    精确计算认清窟窿
    自报互报形成运动
    石匣整出村财百余万
    【本报左权讯】石匣整财在前一段也作了一些成绩，共整出东西价值七万多元，这时就有些人认为差不多了，再整也没甚了。领导上先解除干群中的糊涂思想，展开了群众性的自觉整财运动。其作法如下：
    一、明确整财目的，解除思想顾虑。如有些人说：“今春整关系，弄的昏头昏脑可怕啦。如今又要整财，还不知怎样弄哩！”了解顾虑后，反复说明，整财不但是支持大反攻，整出财产刨老根，增加渡荒补窟窿力量，而且是减轻自己负担的重要工作。这样群众感到对自己有利，才积极起来。其次，让群众讨论明确整财不是反贪污，个人自报出来，不算耻辱。整出东西是属本村的，归本村。
    二、算大帐、算小帐，看清窟窿，依靠贫雇带领全体找补绽。解除了思想顾虑之后，更进一步的从算大小帐作起，让群众了解自己出的钱跑到那里去了。石匣算了去年农民负担帐后群众都说：“整天说负担重哩，这才清楚了负担不重，而是村上动员杂支重，咱要把财政整理好作到村上自给，咱就更能多出负担打蒋伪。”（编者按：要注意克服浪费）在典型户的计算中，贫雇农一般都是边粮、边款少，但村上的各种开支，却超过了中农。如贫农牛存秀，去年只出边粮米十二斤五两，出边款三百五十六元，村上临时动员募捐：学校米五斤，修桥米九斤，唱戏四次出洋五百元，盲人宣传米一斤十两，参军二百元，村公所米一斤五两，闹元霄洋一百五十元，拥军一百元，农会出洋五十元，共出米十七斤，出款一千元。这样超边粮米四斤五两，款六百五十元。中农宋守银去年共边粮小米三百七十斤，边款一千三百元，村上临时动员募捐总共出米一百一十八斤半，出款二千三百七十元。这样刚顶边米一半，款超过一千零七十元。
    经过典型户算帐，都说：“啊呀！原来我出的钱都是跑到村上了。”特别是贫雇，更感到整财重要。这时依靠贫雇，组成整财小组，他们再访问老年人，团结中农，作出了很好成绩。
    三、想个人、想旁人、想全村，自己报、互相报、造成运动。大家有积极整财要求后，就发动先想个人有无公家财物，提倡以身作则，除自己报外，还想别人、想全村，给旁人报、给全村报，这样有些人想隐蔽也隐不住，怕别人报了自己丢人。人人都是查自己、查别人，在六、七天当中，小组报大会报，有些人连一瓦一砖也报出来了，共整理出各种物资，合洋一百一十四万八千五百二十一元。经过全体农民讨论，现大部已投入适当生产门路，全村经费作到自给。（左权县联合办公室、千祥、乃红）
