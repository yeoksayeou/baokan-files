    Taihang Second District Commissioner's Office Instructs Counties to
    Implement the Poor and Hired Peasant Line
    Organize Winter Production
    [Our Taihang News] The Second District Commissioner's Office, in order to vigorously develop winter production to "make up for poor harvests and overcome disasters," has instructed all counties to conscientiously implement the mobilization of poor and hired peasants and solve the difficulties in their production to organize winter production. Specific recommendations are as follows:
    1. Implement the class line and solve the difficulties of poor and hired peasants. Judging from the disaster situation in various counties, the disaster has fallen on the poor and hired peasants, and only in Pingding, Xiyang, and border areas has it extended to some middle peasants. In the hinterland counties, even if the autumn harvest is better, the poor and hired peasants are still inferior in terms of land quantity and quality due to incomplete liberation. On the issue of livestock, most poor and hired peasants have no livestock, and some only have a quarter, a third, or a half. The area around Zuoquan City had a better harvest this year than other counties, but after the autumn harvest, many poor and hired peasants only averaged about one *shi* of coarse grains per person. In Pingding, Xiyang, and other border counties, some even only had a few *dou* of grain. Therefore, at present, most of the poor and hired peasants in our district are still in a state of hunger and cold after the autumn harvest, and urgently demand to engage in production to overcome the disaster. Even if some liberated masses have more grain, they are not enough for living after purchasing farm tools and livestock, and they have no capital to engage in winter production. Therefore, winter production must clearly implement the class line. Every cadre must start from investigating and understanding the needs of the poor and hired peasants, and then help solve their difficulties and actively engage in production. Cadres at all levels must not limit their understanding of the disaster and their leadership of production to a few average figures. Only by solving the difficulties of poor and hired peasants in terms of capital, technology, and various production conditions can winter production have a backbone, can the labor, animal power, and capital of the middle peasants be organized together, can spinning, weaving, transportation, and workshops be fully developed, and can the threat of disaster to the poor and hired peasants be eliminated.
    2. Establish the leadership of the poor and hired peasants and organize technology, capital, labor, and livestock. The organization and leadership of winter production must be centered on the poor and hired peasants. Generally, winter production requires livestock, technology, and capital. According to the surveys in various counties, poor and hired peasants lack sufficient conditions in these aspects, and they only have labor. Therefore, how to combine poor and hired peasants with those who have technology, capital, and livestock according to the way out of production is a major issue in organizing production this winter. According to the reflection from Yushe, most of those who are organized have technology, and the poor and hired peasants cannot participate. From the surface, it seems that winter production is doing well, but the disaster of the poor and hired peasants still cannot be overcome. All districts and villages must pay full attention to this issue and appropriately study the method of profit sharing between labor, capital, and technology in production; on the one hand, establish the leadership of the poor and hired peasants in spinning, weaving, transportation, workshops, and other organizations, and on the other hand, persuade and mobilize the middle peasants, the elderly, and children to participate, so that everyone benefits and produces together.
    3. Solve the capital for production of poor and hired peasants. The poor and hired masses in Xiguan, Zuoquan said: "Winter production is good, but we have no capital." The poor and hired masses have just been liberated and have not yet recovered. Although they have labor, they are extremely short of funds. All counties and districts should conduct a general review of past loans, and the poor and hired masses should discuss and recover the loans from households that should not have been loaned, and redistribute them. Border counties and disaster areas should distribute loans and grain to poor and hired peasants according to the opinions of the poor and hired peasants. After the financial rectification in various counties, all the grain and funds from the rectification should be used as production funds for the poor and hired peasants. Counties in the hinterland should pay more attention to this issue. The fruits of struggle that have not been distributed in each village must be immediately discussed and distributed according to the needs of the poor and hired peasants, and help the poor and hired peasants invest in production. All the above grain and funds must be careful not to be distributed and loaned equally among the masses, but to focus on solving the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants, and take care of the poor military dependents and families of revolutionary martyrs.
    4. Cooperatives should become the organizational core of winter production. At present, only a few cooperatives in various places have reversed their direction and directly organized mass production; most are still stagnant on the old basis and do not help the masses in production; worse, they occupy some or most of the loans for profit to maintain the life within the cooperative. This not only fails to help the masses in production, but violates the interests of the masses and misappropriates loans, resulting in very bad feedback from the masses on the cooperatives. Therefore, cooperatives that have not been transformed during winter production should use loans to closely connect the relationship between cooperatives and the masses. Cooperatives that violate the demands and interests of the masses must thoroughly transform the leadership and change the working principles. All levels of cooperatives must be transformed in the actual actions of winter production, and pay attention to how to reduce internal expenses. Pingding proposed that cooperatives should not light fires, which is also a method. In short, it is required that all manpower and funds of the cooperatives should be invested in winter production, and lead the masses to carry out production, so as to achieve the core role.
    In addition, in spinning and weaving, it is necessary to improve technology and quality. In production projects, it is required to carry out multiple projects in multiple ways separately. In terms of funds and labor, they should be flexibly concentrated and decentralized or decentralized and concentrated, and there should be reliable plans and intelligence to overcome blindness in production. Universally implement thrift and prohibit waste. (Second District Construction Section)

    太行二专署指示各县
    贯彻贫雇路线
    组织冬季生产
    【本报太行讯】二专署为大力开展冬季生产，“弥补歉收，渡过灾荒”，特指示各县，认真贯彻贫雇的发动，与解决贫雇生产中的困难来组织冬季生产。具体意见如下：
    一、贯彻阶级路线，解决贫雇困难。根据各县灾情看来，灾荒落到了贫雇农民身上，只在平定、昔阳和边地才扩及一部中农。腹地各县，即使秋收较好，但由于翻身不彻底，贫雇农民在土地数量、质量上均差。在牲口问题上，大部分贫雇无牲口，有的亦只是四分之一，三分之一，或二分之一。左权城周围今年收成较其他各县均好，然秋收后贫雇农民每人只平均粗粮一石左右者为数很多。平定、昔阳边地各县，甚至有的只是几斗粮食。因此，目前我区贫雇农民在秋收后，绝大部分仍是处于饥寒交迫的生活，迫切要求进行生产，战胜灾荒。即使有个别翻身群众收粮较多，但购置农具牲口后即不够生活，进行冬季生产，又无资本。因此，冬季生产必须明确贯彻阶级路线，每个干部必须从调查了解贫雇生活要求，进而帮助解决困难，积极进行生产。各级干部同志对灾情的了解和生产的领导，绝不能只限于若干平均数字；只有从资本上、技术上及各种生产条件上，解决了贫雇农民困难，冬季生产才能有骨干，才能把中农的劳力、畜力、资本一齐组织进来，纺织、运输、作坊才能全面开展，才能解除贫雇的灾荒威胁。
    二、确立贫雇领导权，把技术、资金、劳畜力组织起来。冬季生产组织领导，必须贫雇为核心。冬季生产中一般的是畜力、技术、和资本，根据各县的调查，贫雇农民在这几方面均缺乏充分条件，他们只有劳动力。因此，如何把贫雇农民依据生产出路，和有技术的人有资本的人有畜力的人共同结合起来，是今冬组织生产上一个大问题。据榆社的反映，组织起来的多是有技术的，贫雇参加不了，这样从表面上看来，冬季生产搞的不坏，但贫雇的灾荒仍旧无法克服。各区村必须充分注意这一问题，并适当研究生产中劳力资本技术的分红办法；一面在纺织、运输、作坊等组织中确立贫雇的领导权，一面说服动员中农、老汉、儿童全部参加，作到大家有利，共同生产。
    三、解决贫雇生产的资本。左权西关贫雇群众说：“冬季生产好倒好，就是没资本。”贫雇群众刚翻身，尚未换过气，虽有劳力，但资金异常缺乏。各县区应普遍检查过去贷款，由贫雇群众讨论，把不应贷款户的款收回，重新分配。边地各县和灾区，应依贫雇讨论意见，把贷款、贷粮发给贫雇农民。各县整财后，应把整出之粮款全部用作贫雇生产资金。腹地各县更应注意这一问题，各村没有分配的斗争果实，须立即按贫雇需要讨论分配，并帮助贫雇投资生产。以上各种粮款，均须注意不能在群众中平均发放借贷，要掌握解决贫雇困难，并照顾贫苦之军干烈属。
    四、合作社应成为冬季生产的组织核心。目前各地合作社，只有少数在方向上扭转，直接组织群众生产；大部分还在旧的基础上停着，对群众的生产帮助不大；更坏的在贷款上反而占用一部或大部进行营利，以维持社内生活，这样不但不能帮助群众生产，却违反群众利益而挪用贷款，结果群众对合作社的反映很坏。因此，冬季生产中没有改造的合作社，以通过贷款来密切合作社与群众的关系。违背群众要求、群众利益的合作社，必须彻底改造领导成分，改变工作方针。各级合作社必须在冬季生产的实际行动中，加以改造，并注意如何减轻社内开支，平定提出合作社不起火也是一种办法。总之，要求合作社的全部人力资金争取都投入冬季生产中，并领导群众进行生产，这样才能达到核心作用。
    此外，在纺织上要提高技术提高质量。在生产项目上要求多头多路的分别进行，在资金及劳力上应灵活集中分散或分散集中，并有可靠的计划和情报，以克服生产中的盲目现象。普遍贯彻节约，禁止浪费。（二专建设科）
