　　Scientific Management Benefits Both Labor and Capital
  　Changzhi Summarizes One Year of Production Experience
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 27th dispatch] Fourteen factories in Changzhi recently held a meeting to summarize the production movement of the past year (from the 27th of February to now). According to Song Youxin, director of the city's trade union, the industrial production in Changzhi has significantly improved in terms of both quantity and quality over the past year. For example, the Huasheng Textile Factory produced two dozen towels per machine per day in the first half of last year, two and a half dozen in the second half, and the "February 7th" plan called for three dozen. After "May 1st," production increased to 100 dozen per month, and after "August 1st," it was further increased to 120 dozen per month. The Huaxing Silk Weaving Factory exceeded the original plan by 130 percent. According to statistics from Junji and eight other factories, the original plan was exceeded by 44.99 percent. The Yihecheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xinhua Paper Mill, Printing Factory, and other three factories have collectively renovated twelve pieces of equipment including electric grinding machines, undershirt machines, and lithographic printing machines over the past year. After the paper mill renovated its tools, it saved 4,500 labor days and doubled production, changing from single-sided to double-sided paper. In addition to summarizing achievements and exchanging experiences, Comrade Yan of the Municipal Party Committee pointed out in his concluding remarks that two issues should be clarified in the current light industrial production in Changzhi: the first is the issue of product sales, which is also related to the future development of light industry. Some people believe that the sales of light industrial products are not large and have no confidence in the future development, and some have even changed careers. However, according to a survey by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, 90,000 jin of cloth are sold in Changzhi in ten days, most of which are local products from other places, while the city's own products cannot be sold. The main reason for this is that the technology is low and the quality is lower than that of local products from other places. Therefore, in the future, the sales of finished products will not be a problem only if we improve technology, improve tools, and improve quality. For example, the Hengtai Factory only pursued quantity but not quality last year, and 12 months' worth of towels were not sold. This year, they paid attention to improving technology, enabling workers to study Donglu goods, weave long-haired, one-sided towels, and pick out coarse threads to weave large towels, and as a result, the supply could not meet the demand. The second problem is that in terms of business management, some factory managers are so-called new managers with old ideas, and they do not take enough care of the interests of workers, so the workers' production enthusiasm is not high. Therefore, in the future, our management of factories must truly achieve democracy and mutual benefit, enlighten workers' production consciousness, and achieve mutual benefit between labor and capital through scientific management.

### 科学经营劳资两利　长治总结一年生产经验

　　科学经营劳资两利
  　长治总结一年生产经验
    【本报太行二十七日电】长治十四个工厂，于日前开会总结一年（二七到现在）的生产运动。据该市职工会宋有信主任说：一年来长市工业生产，无论在数质量上，均有显著的提高：如华盛纺织厂，去年前半年每张机一天织毛巾两打，后半年两打半，今年“二七”计划是三打，“五一”以后增至每月一百打，“八一”后又提高到每月一百廿打。华兴丝织厂则超过原计划的百分之一百三。另据军记等八个工厂统计，超过了原计划百分之四四·九九。义合成染织厂，新华造纸厂，印刷厂等三个厂，一年来共计改造了电碾、背心机、石印机等十二件。纸厂在改造工具后，省工四千五百个，增产一倍，由单印纸抄成双印纸。会议除总结成绩与交流经验外，最后市委阎同志在总结发言中指出：长市目前轻工业生产中应明确两个问题：第一个是成品的销路问题，也是有关轻工业的发展前途问题，有些人以为轻工业成品销路不大，对发展前途没有信心，甚至有的转了业。但据工商局调查，长市十天内销布九万斤，大部是外来土产，本市成品却不能销售，其主要原因是技术低，质量低于外产土货。因此今后只有提高技术改良工具提高质量，成品销路才不成问题。如恒太工厂，去年只求数量不求质量，存了十二个月毛巾没有卖出，今年注意提高了技术，使工人研究东路货，织长毛一面光手巾，挑出粗线织长大手巾，结果出货不够卖。第二个问题是经营管理上，有些工厂经理是所谓新经理旧思想，对工人利益照顾不够，因之工人生产情绪不高。因此我们今后对工厂的管理要真正做到民主两利，启发工人生产自觉，科学经营达到劳资两利。
