Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th. Since July to November, for five months, the Binhai region's cooperative textile industry has achieved epoch-making progress by combining land reform review, adjusting and cleansing bad leadership elements, and taking over the shares and tools of local bullies and landlords, with emancipated peasants managing themselves. According to a survey by the Industrial Department of the Commissioner's Office in the six districts of Southern, Rizhao, Zhuting (former Ganyu), and Ju counties, the cooperatives in these areas, during the review, cleansed 517 staff members who were bad elements from landlords and rich peasants. After the basic masses elected by the people took control of the management, most of them corrected the past bad phenomena of deviating from the interests of the masses and engaging solely in speculative trade and production. Most of the cadres, after being reviewed and supervised by the masses, have also eliminated past corruption, waste, and selfishness. The masses truly feel that the cooperatives are their own, and thus invest a large amount of capital to develop production. In the aforementioned six districts of Zhu and Ju, there were only 669 cooperatives before the review, but now they have developed to 980 (there are already 1,230 cooperatives in the entire Binhai region). Through this reorganization, the business of cooperatives in various places has developed more rapidly. In Junan County alone, among the 366 cooperatives, there are 263 comprehensive cooperatives, 18 ironworker cooperatives, 32 carpentry cooperatives, 39 medical cooperatives, and 14 others, averaging one in every two and a half villages. Shares have increased from over 12.7 million to over 30.4 million, and members have increased from 25,000 to 45,000. The leadership structure of the cooperatives is also becoming more sound. The entire region has a "Cooperative Promotion Society" to uniformly lead the cooperative production cause in various counties, coordinate production tools and raw materials, issue loans, and publish "Cooperative Communications," a regular business publication, to exchange production experiences in various places. Since October, the Cooperative Promotion Society has focused on textiles as its central business, distributing 100,000 catties of cotton and 6,000 catties of thread to Junan, Ju, and Rizhao counties, and lending nearby dyeing machines and towel machines to several district joint cooperatives. It also provides cadres and technical workers to cultivate the factoryization of cooperatives and improve textile technology. According to statistics from the Commissioner's Office, under the promotion of cooperatives in various places, most of the 23,000 large and small looms and 400,000 spinning wheels in the entire region have been started. In October alone, more than 25,000 bolts of cloth were produced.
