Huguan Dispatch: In the East Chongxian District of the Third District, although the leading members of the textile industry were mostly poor and hired laborers, their lack of experience and technical skills led to uncertainty and a lack of confidence in leadership. In all eight natural villages of the district, a mass mobilization of poor and hired women was conducted with the aim of educating them to awaken, take charge, and become masters of their own destiny. During the training, Li Songxiang said, "My husband used to be a hired worker for the landlord Ma Chang's family. Now that we have turned over a new leaf, we must step up production." Zhang Mairong said, "I was a child bride, and now I have been liberated and turned over a new leaf. This autumn, I will mobilize my husband to join the army, and I will step up production myself." Everyone recalled the past, and the more they thought about it, the more painful it became. Xiao Dannian said, "We have so many difficulties with the weather! We are still wearing tattered cotton clothes, which are not as good as those worn by the landlords and rich peasants. They look down on us. Xiao Maoze from Xishanhou (the poorest woman) became a group leader, and the landlord cursed her, saying: 'Neither fish nor fowl, what kind of thing are you to lead people!' She spun yarn and didn't have a loom. She borrowed the cooperative's loom and was weaving when the women's association secretary (an old middle peasant) saw it and said: 'No wonder the cooperative is losing money. You are all borrowing the looms. Get off the loom quickly, or you will be criticized.'" Wang Fuhua from West Chongxian said: "The women's association secretary is an old middle peasant and looks down on us. People say: A rich person matches a rich person; pork is not worthy of tofu, and they resent us for being failures." After discussion, everyone agreed that they must take charge and become masters in order to vigorously develop production.

It was also decided that a central credit cooperative should be established in the district, and a loan of 700,000 was obtained, which was entirely lent to the poorest and most needy women to solve their financial difficulties. Secondly, they promoted class love, mutual assistance, and mutual aid. For example, La Ze from Xishanhou automatically lent cotton to Chang Meiqi, who had no wife, thus solving the financial difficulties of the poor. In terms of organizational form, the past practice of concentrating in factories was felt to be inconvenient. Poor people have many things to do at home, so this winter, the unit is a group, spinning, weaving, wearing, and selling independently. Finally, everyone felt that the difficulties had been solved, the methods had been found, and they challenged each other. A Winter Mutual Aid Production Committee was established in the district, meeting every half month to supervise and study technology. Everyone's enthusiasm was very high.

    壶关东崇贤小区
    发动贫妇领导纺织
    【本报壶关讯】三区东崇贤小区的纺织领导成份虽多贫雇，但因大家经验少，技术差，不知该干啥，领导信心不高。全小区八个自然村，集训贫雇妇女进行思想大发动，目的是教育她们觉悟起来，当家作主，训练中李松香说：“我男人过去给地主麻长家当雇工，现在咱初翻了身，可得加油生产。”张买荣说：“我是个童养媳，现在大解放翻了身，今秋我动员男人去参军，我自己加油生产”，大家回忆过去，越想越痛，小旦娘说：“咱的天气困难可多哩！穿的还是破棉衣，看人家地主、富农比咱穿的还强，人家看不起咱来，西山后小毛则（最贫苦妇女），当了一个组长，地主骂他说：‘妖不妖，六不六，啥东西还领导人哩！’纺上了线子没机，借合作社的机子上了线子正在织，被妇救秘书见了（老中农成份）说：‘不怨合作社赔钱，布机都你们借了，赶快下了机，不然就要斗争你。’西崇贤王付花说：“妇救秘书是个老中农，看不起咱来，人家说：一富配一富，猪肉配不上豆腐，嫌咱败兴。”经大家讨论后，一致认为非当家作主不能大力生产。
    又决定全小区成立了一个中心信用社，贷回了款七十万，完全贷给最困难之贫雇妇女，解决大家的资金困难。其次发扬大家的阶级友爱互助互济，如西山后辣则自动给长没妻借棉花，这样解决了贫雇的资金困难。在组织形式上，过去以工厂集中，大家感到不方便，贫雇家中事多，今冬是以小组为单位，自纺自织自穿自卖。最后大家感觉困难也解决了，办法也有了，互相提了挑战，并以全小区成立了一个冬季互助生产委员会，每半月一开会，督促及研究技术，大家情绪很高涨。
