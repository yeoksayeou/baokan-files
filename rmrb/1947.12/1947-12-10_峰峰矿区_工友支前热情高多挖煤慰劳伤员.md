    Workers Show Enthusiasm for Supporting the Front, Mine More Coal to Comfort the Wounded
    [Report from this newspaper] At the Handan Mining District's expanded cadre meeting, upon learning that the recuperating soldiers in our Second Field Army hospital were short of coal for heating, everyone unanimously decided that each person would produce a few extra baskets of coal each day, in addition to their regular quota (the daily work requirement), to support the recuperating comrades. After receiving the news, the miners in each mine immediately responded, saying in unison, "Who are the recuperating soldiers shedding blood for? What does it matter if we sweat a little? Taking care of the recuperating soldiers is also supporting the front." In just the two days of the 24th and 25th, more than 400 extra baskets of coal were produced. Now, six tons and 353 baskets (a total of about 37,000 catties, worth about 300,000 yuan) have been used to comfort the recuperating soldiers. After hearing this news, the recuperating soldiers in the hospital were very grateful. In addition to expressing their determination to recuperate and return to the front lines as soon as possible to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, they proposed publishing an article in the newspaper to commend the workers' love and enthusiasm for supporting the front.

    工友支前热情高多挖煤慰劳伤员
    【本报讯】峰峰矿区扩大干部会上，听到我们第二野战医院休养员烤火的煤不够烧，大家一致议决，每人每日除正盘（每日应劳动数目）外，多出几筐煤拥护休养同志们。各窑工友接到消息后，马上响应，大家同声说：“休养员流血为谁？我们流些汗，妨什么事，照顾休养员，也就是支援前线。”仅在二十四、五两天内，就增产煤四百余筐，现在已慰劳休养员六吨又三百五十三筐（合计约三万七千斤，约价三十余万元）。医院休养员知道这个消息后，非常感激，除提出安心休养，早日恢复身体重上前线消灭蒋介石外，纷纷提出登报，表扬工友们的热爱与支前的热情。（符碧桂）
