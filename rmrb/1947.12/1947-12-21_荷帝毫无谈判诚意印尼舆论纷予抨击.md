Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. A comprehensive report from Batavia and Yogyakarta: The Indonesian-Dutch negotiations, mediated by the US, Australian and Belgian "Committee," began on the morning of the 8th on the US transport ship Renville, anchored in Indonesian territorial waters. The Indonesian representatives attending the negotiations included current Prime Minister Sjahrir, Foreign Minister Salim, Minister of Education Romi Mohamad, and other important officials. The Dutch representatives were merely unimportant colonial officials and representatives of puppet regimes. The Executive Committee of the Indonesian Islamic Party lodged a serious protest with the "mediation" committee regarding this. At the meeting on the 9th, the Indonesian and Dutch sides agreed on two technical proposals: One was to establish a mixed small committee, composed of the "mediation" committee and the heads of the Indonesian and Dutch delegations. This body would be dedicated to examining the qualifications of the members of both delegations. The second was to stipulate that the delegations should hold separate, informal talks with representatives of the "mediation" committee. However, key issues such as the implementation of a ceasefire order and the termination of military actions were not agreed upon due to the Dutch side's sabotage. Indonesian public opinion has widely criticized the Netherlands for its lack of sincerity in the negotiations. The Republic's official newspaper, "Liberation Daily," commented: "The Dutch delegation is composed of third-rate colonial officials. The attendance of these unqualified representatives and Dutch-raised 'running dogs' at the talks demonstrates the deceitful behavior of Dutch imperialism, which aims to delay and undermine the negotiations." "National Daily" and "Indonesian Herald" exposed the Dutch conspiracy, saying: "The Netherlands is forced to negotiate under the pressure of world opinion. Therefore, it has not abandoned its war plan. On the contrary, Dutch imperialism still dreams of conquering the entire Indonesia." All newspapers attached great importance to Prime Minister Sjahrir's speech at a mass welcome rally in Batavia on the 7th. In his speech, Sjahrir emphasized the Republic's position, saying: "We began to fight for the freedom of the Indonesian people, we fought for the rights of a nation of tens of millions of people, we are proud that Batavia and all the people of Indonesia will forever be loyal to the Republic. The Indonesian people have now demonstrated unprecedented unity, and no matter what, the Netherlands cannot stop our correct goal. Final victory will surely belong to us."

　　荷帝毫无谈判诚意印尼舆论纷予抨击
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合巴城、日惹讯：在美澳比三国“委员会”主持调停下的印荷谈判，已于八日晨在停泊于印尼领海之美运输舰伦维尔号上开始。出席谈判之印尼代表，包括现总理沙利佛丁、外长沙立姆、教育部长罗密卓毓等重要官员，荷方代表则仅属不关重要之殖民地官员及傀儡政权代表，印尼回教党执委会为此向“调停”委员会提出严重抗议。九日会上印荷双方同意两项技术性提案：其一为成立一混合小型委员会，由“调停”委员会及印荷代表团团长组成，此一机构专事检查双方代表团团员之资格，其二为规定双方代表团应分别地非正式地与“调停”委员会代表举行会谈。但关于实行停战令及终止军事行动等关键问题，因荷方采取破坏态度而未获协议。印尼舆论对荷兰在谈判中之毫无诚意纷予抨击。共和国机关报“解放报”评称：“荷兰代表团是由一些第三等殖民地官员所构成，以这些不够资格的代表及荷兰豢养下的”狗腿子“出席会谈，说明了荷兰帝国主义的欺骗行为，其目的在于拖延并破坏谈判”。“民族报”“印尼导报”等揭露荷兰之阴谋称：“荷兰是在世界舆论压力下被迫进行谈判，因此他并未放弃战争计划。相反的，荷兰帝国主义仍梦想征服整个印尼。”各报对总理沙利佛丁在七日巴城群众欢迎会上的演词甚为重视，沙氏在演说中着重表明共和国的立场称：“我们开始为印尼人民的自由而战，我们为包括数千万人口的国家权利而战，我们为巴城及印尼全体人民永远效忠共和国而感到骄傲，印尼人民现在已表现了空前未有的团结，荷兰无论如何是不能阻挠我们的正确目标，最后胜利必定属于我们。”
