　　A Certain Brigade of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region
　　Helps the Masses in the New District Overturn Their Lives
　　[Our newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch, 22nd] A certain brigade of the military region entered the new district of northern Henan to lead the masses in overturning their lives. On the 5th, the 4th Regiment arrived at Village ×× in the Sixth District southwest of Jun County (which is a guerrilla zone). The masses there expressed a warm welcome to our army and denounced the crimes of the Chiang army, landlords, and "Homecoming Corps" in the area, such as seizing grain, conscripting soldiers, killing people, and beating and scolding, and demanded to overturn their lives and seek revenge. The next day, when the regiment's political department cooperated with district cadres to organize a mass meeting, even though the enemy came out to harass, the masses not only did not panic but became even more active, crowding into the landlord's courtyard. An old man in the crowd, about fifty or sixty years old, said, "Today is the day we see the sun! ......" The masses rushed to move grain, clothes, furniture, and other things to their homes one after another. On the 8th, the 5th Regiment arrived at Xiaotun Village, eighteen miles north of Changyuan, an enemy area, and convened a mass meeting, explaining to the masses that the landlords' property was the blood and sweat of the masses, and that the People's Army resolutely supported the masses, etc. Our troops personally helped to bring out a lot of packages, cotton, cloth, wheat, and other things to distribute to the masses. Later, three old men said to us in low voices, "There are three more landlord families to the east." I immediately supported the masses, and the ill-gotten wealth of these three landlord families was immediately distributed. The masses all said, "The Eighth Route Army is truly the army of us poor people!"
