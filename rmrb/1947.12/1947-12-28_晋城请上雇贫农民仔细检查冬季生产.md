　　Jincheng Asks Hired and Poor Peasants to Carefully Inspect Winter Production
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 26th] The Jincheng County Committee convened a conference on December 14th with over 700 people, including cadres from various districts, village cadres with hired and poor peasant backgrounds, and representatives of hired and poor peasants, to inspect winter production in various regions. First, it was discovered that in winter production, each district only issued general calls, lacking specific guidance. Resistance thoughts and specific difficulties in production, especially the difficulties faced by hired and poor peasants in winter production, were not resolved in a timely manner. Cadres at all levels exhibited mechanical waiting and the phenomenon of forcibly organizing "three-way mutual aid teams." For example, in Heba Village, in order to form a "three-way mutual aid team," meetings were held for five to ten days, delaying work and failing to organize, greatly harming the time and energy of the hired and poor peasants in winter production. Some county and district cadres, with consistently poor work styles, feared the rise of the masses and did not actively lead winter production, let alone organize hired and poor peasants for production. In some villages, they shouted slogans about the hired and poor peasant line but did not practically solve difficulties. In some villages, they only selected a few hired and poor peasant team leaders or cadres and considered that they had followed the hired and poor peasant line, while the only comrade who truly implemented the district party committee's call and followed the hired and poor peasant line was Sun Qunsuo, the branch secretary of Yuneng Village in the Third District. He visited hired and poor peasants door-to-door to inquire about their difficulties, set production plans for each household, and specifically solved difficulties, empowering hired and poor peasants and promoting the village's production movement. In past loans, there was a complete lack of class line. Cadres believed that hired and poor peasants were incapable of managing and feared that they would not be able to repay the loans. Therefore, cadres did not write loan recommendation letters for hired and poor peasants or act as guarantors for them. The banks still followed the old routine, with complicated procedures and short repayment periods. Hired and poor peasants feared they would not be able to repay the loans and therefore dared not take out loans. In particular, the banks emphasized that loans should be combined with idle capital, resulting in past loans being mainly given to middle and rich peasants and village cadres, with very few loans given to hired and poor peasants. Because loans were handled by village cadres in the past, many malpractices occurred. For example, Zhao Fulao, a cadre from Shiwotuo Village in the Fourth District, distributed the loan based on labor power after receiving it, with full laborers receiving 2,000 each and half laborers receiving 1,000 each. Some people disliked the small amount and refused to take the loan, so he took out 25,000 yuan himself for production. A cadre from a village in the Sixth District first used the loan for one round of production before distributing it to the masses. These shortcomings and biases were severely criticized at the meeting.

　　晋城请上雇贫农民仔细检查冬季生产
    【本报太岳二十六日电】晋城县委会，十二月十四日召开各区干部及雇贫成份的村干部和雇贫代表等七百余人大会，检查各地冬季生产。第一，发现在冬季生产中，各区只有一般号召，缺乏具体指导，对生产中的抵抗思想与具体困难，特别是雇贫冬季生产中的困难，没有得到及时的解决，各级干部存在着机械的等待思想，和硬组织“三合互助组”的现象。如贺跋村，为了搞“三合互助组”，开了五天到十天的会，工也误了，也没组成，大大伤害了雇贫在冬季生产中的时间和精力。有些县区干部，一贯作风不好，怕群众起来，不积极领导冬季生产，更不组织雇贫生产。有的村庄，空喊雇贫路线，不去实际解决困难，有的村庄，只是选上几个雇贫小组长或干部，就算走了雇贫路线，而真正贯彻区党委号召，走雇贫路线的，只有三区庾能村支书孙群锁同志，他是挨门挨户访雇贫困难，按家订生产计划，具体解决困难，雇贫掌权，推动全村生产运动。在过去的贷款中，完全没有阶级路线，干部认为雇贫不会经管，怕贷上还不了，因之干部不给雇贫写贷款介绍信，不给雇贫作保，银行还是老一套作风，手续麻烦，期限短。雇贫农贷款怕周转不过来就得还，因此也不敢贷款，尤其是银行强调贷款结合游资，结果过去每次贷款，都贷给中富农与村干部，雇贫贷的很少。由于过去把贷款交给村干部处理，也发生许多弊病。如四区石窝坨村干赵复老，贷回款后，按劳力分配，全劳力每人两千，半劳力一千，有些人嫌少不贷，他自己即贷了两万五千元搞生产。六区某村干部，先拿贷款搞了一次生产，才给群众分发。这些缺点与偏向，在会上都受到了严厉的批评。
