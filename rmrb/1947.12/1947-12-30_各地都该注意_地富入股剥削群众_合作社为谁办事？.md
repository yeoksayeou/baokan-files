　　Attention Should Be Paid Everywhere
  　Landlords and Rich Peasants Exploit the Masses Through Stock Investments
  　For Whom Do Cooperatives Work?
To the Editors:
    Recently, many problems have been discovered in cooperatives. Unexpectedly, the targets of struggle are depositing large amounts of shares in the cooperatives to exploit the masses' production dividends. For example, in the Dongshang Village Cooperative of the Lincheng Chengguan Base Point, among the fifty-one shareholders with a total share capital of 380,400 yuan, nine households who are targets of struggle account for 84,400 yuan; Yang Lao Hong's household alone invested 43,200 yuan. Similarly, in Yangtian Village, Second District of Yushe, the Pei Shengfu Mutual Aid Society has twenty-five households with 60,000 yuan in share capital. Poor peasant Pei Gengwei has only 300 yuan, while nine households of landlords and rich peasants have 32,000 yuan! In addition, in the Liujia Village Cooperative of the Third District of Changzhi, the share capital of the targets of struggle is almost twice that of the emancipated households (based on the average per household)! This situation is quite common. The exploitation of the masses is as follows: For example, in the recent dividend distribution in Liujia Village, seventy-six emancipated households received a total of 466,100 yuan; twenty-eight households of landlords and rich peasants received a total of 341,900 yuan. On a per household basis, the emancipated households received an average of over 6,100 yuan per household, while the landlords and rich peasants received an average of over 12,200 yuan per household, a ratio of exactly one to two! Han Gou of the village said: This is seeking benefits for the landlords.
    Our cooperatives should support the production of hired and poor peasants and serve the masses; however, the above-mentioned cooperatives have served the landlords and rich peasants. It is surprising that the cooperatives can allow the targets of struggle to exploit the masses in disguise? Why are landlords and rich peasants allowed to have more than twice the total share capital of poor and middle peasants, and still honestly give them a large amount of dividends? Why wasn't it discovered and corrected in time? What are the cooperative leaders doing? What are the village and district leaders doing? There are really big problems here! This should immediately attract the attention of all regions and be resolved quickly!

### 各地都该注意　地富入股剥削群众　合作社为谁办事？

　　各地都该注意
  　地富入股剥削群众
  　合作社为谁办事？编辑同志：
    合作社近来发现很多问题，出人意料的是斗争对象在合作社里存放大量股金，剥削群众生产红利。例如临城城关基点洞上村合作社，五十一个股东，共股金三十八万零四百元，其中九户斗争对象，即占股金八万四千四百元；而杨老红一户即入股四万三千二百元。同样，榆社二区仰天村，裴生福互助社，二十五户，六万元股金，贫农裴更维只有三百元，九户地富则有三万二千元！此外，长治三区六家村合作社，斗争对象的股金几乎超过翻身户的一倍（按户平均数）！这种情形相当普遍。其剥削群众情形：如六家村最近一次批红，翻身户七十六户，共批四十六万六千一百元；地富二十八户，共批三十四万一千九百元。按户平均，则为翻身户每户六千一百余元，地富每户一万二千二百余元，恰为一比二！该村憨狗说：这是给地主谋了利益啦。
    我们的合作社，应该扶植雇贫生产，为群众办事；但上述合作社则是替地富办了事。令人惊奇的是：为什么合作社竟能允许斗争对象来变相剥削群众？为什么竟让地富股金占了贫、中农总和的一倍以上，还老老实实给人家分了大批红利？为什么没有及时发现、纠正？合作社领导是干甚的？村、区领导做什么去了？这里面实在大有问题！应立刻引起各地注意，并速求解决！
