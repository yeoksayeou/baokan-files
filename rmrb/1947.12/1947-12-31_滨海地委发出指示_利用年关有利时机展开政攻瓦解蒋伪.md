　　Binhai Prefectural Committee Issues Instructions
  　Utilize the Favorable Opportunity of the New Year to Launch Political Offensives and Disintegrate the Chiang-Puppet Regime
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th] The Binhai CCP Prefectural Committee and Military Sub-district Political Department recently issued instructions on the political offensive against the enemy during the New Year period. The instructions pointed out that under the influence of our comprehensive counter-offensive and the great victory in Laiyang, Jiaodong, the Chiang bandits felt that the prospects for the civil war were even bleaker during the second New Year of the Self-Defense War, and their homesickness and war-weariness were more serious than ever before, making it an extremely favorable opportunity for us to launch a political offensive and disintegrate the Chiang-puppet regime. The main points of the propaganda were put forward: (1) The glorious achievements of our self-defense war in the past year and a half, the opening up and establishment of vast new liberated areas by the southbound Liberation Army, the widespread anti-Chiang struggle of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, and linking them with the victory of the struggle in this area, pointing out the inevitable defeat of the Chiang army and the inevitable victory of the people. (2) Widely publicize the four major documents issued on the Double Tenth Festival, and focus on the policies towards landlords and Chiang's party, government, and military personnel. (3) Publicize Chiang Kai-shek's various crimes of betraying the country and harming the people over the past year. In terms of propaganda methods, effective measures should be taken for specific targets, such as using the language of the masses and the Chiang army soldiers themselves, linking them with the immediate interests of the enemy and puppets, and stimulating their anti-Chiang and homesickness sentiments. The instructions finally pointed out that in order to do this work well, it is also necessary to overcome the phenomena of cadres not paying attention to policy viewpoints and the separation of military offensives from political offensives. Reception centers for Chiang's army defectors can be set up in various counties. For enemy and puppet personnel who have awakened and returned, the government and the farmers' association should make appropriate arrangements or organize meritorious service groups to conduct education and review, and launch a campaign for Chiang's puppet personnel to perform meritorious service and redeem their crimes.

　　滨海地委发出指示
  　利用年关有利时机展开政攻瓦解蒋伪
    【新华社华东廿八日电】滨海中共地委及军分区政治部，于日前发出新旧年关对敌政治攻势指示，指出在我全面反攻及胶东莱阳大捷影响下之自卫战争第二个年关，蒋匪更感内战前途暗淡，思家厌战情绪，比任何时候都严重，为我开展政治攻势瓦解蒋伪之极有利时机。并提出宣传要点：（一）我一年半以来自卫战争的辉煌战绩，南下解放军开辟与建立广大新解放区，蒋管区人民的广泛反蒋斗争，并联系本区斗争的胜利，指出蒋军必败、人民必胜的前途。（二）广泛宣传双十节发布之四大文件，并着重其中对地主及蒋方党政军人员的政策。（三）宣传蒋贼一年来卖国殃民的各种罪行。在宣传方法上，要针对具体对象，采取有效办法，如多运用群众的与蒋军士兵本身的语言，连系敌伪切身利益，激发其反蒋思家情绪等。指示最后指出：要使此工作做好，还须在干部中克服不重视政策观点和军事攻势与政治攻势脱节现象。可在各县设立蒋军来归招待所。对于觉悟来归之敌伪人员，政府与农会应适当安排或组织立功组，进行教育审查，开展来归蒋伪立功赎罪运动。
