Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 20th. "Technical assessment" has advanced from commenting on casualties, actions, weapon usage, and utilization of terrain and features to commenting on causes, effects, command, ideology, and evaluating merit, thus comprehensively integrating with combat. For example, during the Jiaohe Campaign, Li Shaocheng, a communications soldier of the Yang Xie Regiment's 5th Company, hit three enemies with five shots. Everyone assessed that his accuracy was due to: (1) composure and calmness, (2) keeping the rifle steady and stable, (3) holding his breath when aiming and firing. It was also assessed that he had the following effects: (1) stopping the enemy's movement, and (2) encouraging everyone's shooting courage and defense confidence. Another example is after the 7th Company's victorious attack at Zhuyang, a comparison was made between the commands of the 1st and 9th squad leaders. The 1st squad leader directed the machine gun to fire in front of or on the flanks of the troops, and when passing through ditches and open areas, he told everyone to disperse and move quickly. At the same time, the machine gun continuously fired in bursts. He could utilize the terrain and keep up with the troops. The 9th squad leader became separated from his entire squad during the charge. When his submachine gun ran out of bullets, he saw three enemies carrying a machine gun in front of him, and he was helpless. From this, it was studied how to maintain formation, avoid chaos, and prevent crowding during an attack. The detailed actions of the squad leader and combat team before and during the battle were studied to reach conclusions. "Technical assessment" combined with merit evaluation can achieve greater democracy, fairness, and reasonableness. For example, Xu Zhiyou, a deputy company commander, killed more than ten enemies with a machine gun during the defense of Zhouzhuang. After the Zhengzhuang assault, he went into the water and retrieved a heavy machine gun body and three boxes of ammunition. After the battle, some comrades suggested that he be awarded a third-class merit, but during the "technical assessment," Jia Wengui, the deputy squad leader of the 5th squad, pointed out first: "The deputy company commander only killed a dozen enemies with three hundred bullets, so his technique is not very good." Min Zhikui, the deputy of the second platoon, said: "There was a machine gunner next to him, but the deputy company commander did not tell him to fire, which both lost the function of the machine gunner, and neglected the duty of the commander." He also assessed that his retrieving the machine gun in the water was hard work, not a combat achievement. Finally, the entire company passed the decision to award him a fourth-class merit. Through such detailed and in-depth assessment, not only is the interest in learning enhanced and tactics improved, but also the ideology of the troops can be grasped and the merit-seeking movement promoted.

　　华东我军技评更进一步
  　由单纯的评论技术进到评原因评作用
    【新华社华东前线二十日电】“技术评论”由评论伤亡、动作、使用武器、利用地形地物，推进到评论原因、作用、指挥、思想、评功，使与作战全面结合起来。如胶河战役时，杨谢团五连通讯员李少成五枪中三敌。大家评他打得准是因：（一）沉着不慌，（二）枪身放得端正稳固，（三）对瞄准点射击时停止呼吸。又评他起了如下作用：（一）停止敌人的运动，（二）鼓舞了大家射击勇气和守备信心。又如七连在朱阳出击胜利后，以一、九两班长的指挥对比，一班长指挥机枪在部队前面或侧翼开火，通过水沟及开阔地时，叫大家散开动作快。同时机枪不停的打点发。能利用地形，又能跟上部队。九班长冲锋时与全班脱离，冲锋机子弹打完了，看见前面有三个敌人扛着机枪，自己毫无办法。由此研究出出击战应如何掌握不掉队，不混乱，不拥挤，把班长及战斗组战前和战中的细小动作，详细的研究得出结论。“技术评论”结合评功更能做到民主公平合理，如某副连长许之友，周庄守备中用机枪毙敌十余人，郑庄攻坚后，他下水摸起一挺重机枪身子和三箱子弹，战后有同志提议他立三等功，但进行“技评”时五班副贾文贵首先指出：“副连长三百发子弹才打死十几个敌人，技术尚不高。”二排副闵志奎说：“当时有机枪手在旁边副连长不叫他打，既失了机枪手作用，又忽略了指挥员的职务。并评他下水摸机枪是苦功。不是战功，最后全连通过他立四等功。经这样细致深刻的评论，既提高学习兴趣，提高战术，又能掌握部队思想推动立功运动。
