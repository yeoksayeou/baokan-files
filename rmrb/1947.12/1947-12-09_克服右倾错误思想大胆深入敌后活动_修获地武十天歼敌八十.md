　　Overcoming Right-Leaning Errors, Boldly Penetrating Deep Behind Enemy Lines
  　The Xiuhuo Local Armed Forces Annihilated Eighty Enemies in Ten Days
    [Report from this newspaper] The Xiuhuo Local Armed Forces, in conjunction with the militia rotation teams, launched small-scale armed activities against the enemy, suppressing the enemy's arrogance in invading and seizing grain. The enemies in Xiuhuo constantly disrupted the inland areas, launching surprise attacks on Bo'ai Bu Mao, Shi Zhuan Qin, Shangzhuang, and the Nan Gou villages and Da Xiao Zhai of Jiaozuo, capturing our militiamen and village cadres, and looting grain. Some masses showed signs of fear, which affected the autumn storage work. The local armed forces of the area then combined with the militia rotation teams to launch small-scale armed activities, extending into the enemy's heartland to strike at the enemy. After ten days of fighting, seven enemies were killed, twenty were wounded, and fifty-nine were captured alive (including one major quartermaster). Nine rifles were seized, and fifty-three heads of livestock and eight sheep were recovered. After several battles, the erroneous perception of overestimating the enemy among the soldiers was broken, the morale of the masses was stabilized, and local work was carried out. Many villages in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit-occupied areas have approached us to make contact and hand over counter-offensive grain. It was realized in the battles that following the mass line is a good way to win battles. For example, the reconnaissance squad had no results in the first few days, and everyone felt depressed. Later, a "Zhuge Liang" meeting was held. Everyone discussed and came up with ideas, confidence was increased, and as soon as they went out, they captured three alive. The following experiences were also gained: (1) Brave and bold engagement activities, otherwise the purpose of small unit activities cannot be achieved. (2) Alert and calm, adapting to circumstances, not rigidly adhering to rules, attacking from the east and west, sometimes south and sometimes north, leaping activities, and grasping the enemy's patterns. (3) Combining political offensives, after small armed forces penetrate the enemy area, they immediately use propaganda, shouting, and other methods to disintegrate the enemy. (Wang Zhenbiao)

　　克服右倾错误思想大胆深入敌后活动
  　修获地武十天歼敌八十
    【本报讯】修获地方武装结合民兵轮战队，向敌展开小股武装活动，平抑敌进犯抢粮凶焰。修获敌人不断扰乱内地，向博爱卜冒、石专芹、上庄，焦作南苟村、大小寨进行奔袭，捕我民兵村干，抢掠粮食，部分群众表现恐惧情绪，以致影响秋屯工作。该区地方武装随即结合民兵轮战队，展开武装小股活动，伸入敌腹心地区，打击敌人。经十天战斗，毙敌七名，伤敌二十名，活捉五十九名（内少校军需一名），缴步枪九枝，夺回牲口五十三头，羊八只。几次战斗后，打破了战士中对敌人估计过高的错误认识，稳定了群众情绪，开展了地方工作，蒋匪侵占区不少村子都纷纷向我接头，交反攻粮。在战斗中体会到走群众路线是打胜仗的好办法，如侦察班开始几天，没有成绩，大家感到苦闷，后来开“诸葛亮”会，大家讨论，大家想办法，信心提高，一出去，就捉了三个活的。并获得以下几点经验：（一）勇敢大胆的接敌活动，否则不能达到小部队活动的目的。（二）机敏沈着，随机应变，不死守成规，声东击西，忽南忽北，跳跃式的活动，并掌握敌人规律。（三）结合政攻，小股武装深入敌区后，随即利用宣传、喊话等办法，瓦解敌人。（王振彪）
