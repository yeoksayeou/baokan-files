The Ji-Lu-Yu Seventh Prefectural Committee Allocates Bonuses to Promote Year-End Entertainment

[Our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch on the 20th] In order to promote year-end cultural and entertainment activities, the Propaganda Department of the Seventh Prefectural Committee issued a notice and allocated 150,000 yuan in bonuses for cultural and entertainment works. The content of the notice is as follows: 1. Regarding cultural and entertainment work, the New Year should focus on organs and troops, carrying out extensive propaganda for the great counter-offensive and various cultural and entertainment programs celebrating victory. During the old New Year, extensive rural and military cultural and entertainment activities should be carried out to enhance the joyful mood in rural areas and consolidate the troops. The content should be practical and diverse, such as the great counter-offensive, land reform, Yellow River governance, and fighting "returning home corps," but it must be suitable for the local area or the troops, and ideological improvement should be achieved through cultural and entertainment. The form should be popular, such as Yangko dance, stilt walking, flower boats, lion dances, drum storytelling, and lanterns, but attention should be paid to frugality, with fewer large-scale operas and more small-scale performances, and the materials should be compiled by the masses themselves. 2. In order to encourage the creative enthusiasm of farmers, old artists, and soldiers, a bonus of 150,000 yuan is specially awarded. Each county, district, and organ troop can widely mobilize writing. Illiterate people can ask others to write on their behalf. The form is not limited. The works should be sent to the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee before the lunar New Year. In order to correctly judge the merits, the Propaganda Department has specially hired the newspaper, the District Education Section, and the Commissioner's Office Education Section to form a judging committee.
