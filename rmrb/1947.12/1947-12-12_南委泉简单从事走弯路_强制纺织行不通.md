    Nanweiquan Takes a Detour with Oversimplification
    Forced Textile Production Won't Work
    [This Dispatch from our reporter in Licheng] In the Fifth District, Nanweiquan, a recent inspection of textile production revealed that at the beginning of promoting textile production, the ideological problems of the people were not resolved. Instead, plans and inspection systems were simply forced upon them. Everyone spoke well at the meeting, but in reality, there were many problems. Those who could spin five liang only subscribed for two liang, because they originally kept the extra to support the next plan, so they could rest. For example, a woman in the fourth team, who could spin five liang of cotton a day, only subscribed for two liang. When her home was inspected, she secretly hid three liang, preparing to support the next plan. Some people had spinning wheels on their kangs, but were doing other work with their hands, and when they heard someone coming, they would quickly start spinning. In response to this situation, the leadership organized poor and hired women to calculate their family property and assess crop failures, discussing and breaking through ideological obstacles to inspire self-awareness. On December 2nd, Zhao Lianxiu's team first held a meeting to discuss their understanding and feelings about textile production. Zhang Sannv said, "Spinning textiles in winter is indeed the central task, but it's cold and there's no way to spin." Cun Yu said, "My life never ends, and I have a child, so I'm too tired to spin. He either pulls the cotton slivers or pulls the spinning wheel." Then, they discussed whether these difficulties could be overcome and whether not spinning textiles would mean failure to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek. Zhang Gaidi said, "Anyway, we don't want to spin! Do you think it's colder at home or on the front line?" He Guiying said, "Cun Yu, you don't want to spin, but can't you surround your child with quilts on the kang and still spin? If you don't spin in the winter, you won't be able to spin when you open the fields in the hot weather. Your mother-in-law is in her fifties or sixties, and she still gets up early in the dark to spin." Cooperative member Gao Fugui said, "Whoever doesn't have cotton can borrow it from the cooperative. If your home is cold, the cooperative is responsible for repairing your home and buying some coal to burn, and the whole team can spin together." Cun Yu said, "Everyone's suggestions are really helping me. I will get up early and work late, and I will spin two liang of cotton a day." After the discussion, all kinds of ideological problems were resolved, and everyone proposed to challenge other teams. Under the promotion of this team, 144 people in the whole village have started spinning. (Jian Wen)

    南委泉简单从事走弯路
    强制纺织行不通
    【本报黎城讯】五区南委泉近检查纺织，发现在开始推动纺织时，没有解决了大家的思想问题，只是强制订了计划，和检查制度。大家在大会上说的都很好，但实际上问题很多，能纺五两的只订二两，因原是留着支持下个计划，自己能歇歇。如第四队一个妇女，一天能纺五两花，只订了二两，到他家检查，偷藏起三两，准备支持下个计划。有的炕上放着纺花车，手拿着其他活，听人去了，就赶快纺。根据这种情况，领导上就组织贫雇妇女，算家当算歉收，讨论打通思想障碍，启发自觉。十二月二号，赵连秀队首先开会讨论对纺织的认识与感觉，张三女说：“冬天纺织倒是中心，就是冷，没法纺。”寸鱼说：“我这生活就没有完，又有个小孩，累得没法去纺。他不是给你拉花条就是拉纺车。”接着讨论这困难是否能克服？要不纺织是否能刨老蒋？张改弟说：“反正咱是不想纺呀！你说在家冷还是在前线冷？”何贵英说：“寸鱼你是不想纺，小孩用被子围在炕上，还不能纺？冬天不纺热天上开地就更不能纺了。你婆五六十啦，人家还是搭黑起早纺。”合作社高富贵说：“谁要没有花到合作社借。家冷合作社负责修理个家，买些煤烧，全队在一块纺。”寸鱼说：“大家提意见真是帮助我啦，我以后要起早搭黑抽空，一天也要纺二两花。”经过讨论，各种思想都解决了，大家都提出要和其他队挑战。在这队的推动下，全村已有一四四人纺开了。（建文）
