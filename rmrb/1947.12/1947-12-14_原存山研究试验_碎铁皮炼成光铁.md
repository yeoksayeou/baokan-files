    Yuan Cunshan Research Experiment
    Scrap Iron Turned into Bright Iron
    [This newspaper, Lingchuan News] Comrade Yuan Cunshan of Yuanzhuang, Lingchuan, after attending the Second Taihang Heroes Conference, actively led the masses in production. He devised a method to load scrap iron (worth less than ten yuan per catty) from blacksmithing into the pot of a square furnace and refine it into bright iron. When the experiment started, three pots of scrap iron (eight catties per pot) were loaded onto the square furnace. The square furnace workers said, "It won't work, it's a waste of effort!" Cunshan said, "Let's try it." After refining it overnight, they checked the furnace early in the morning and found that the scrap iron in all three pots had been refined into bright iron, with a yield of 70%. The workers were very happy. Each furnace firing can hold 1000 catties of scrap iron, worth 10,000 yuan; using 500 catties of yellow gangue, worth 400 yuan; using 1500 catties of charcoal, worth 1500 yuan; using 100 catties of coal, worth 60 yuan; the total cost is 11,960 yuan.
    Each furnace firing yields 700 catties of bright iron, valued at 50 yuan per catty, totaling 35,000 yuan. After deducting expenses, the net profit is 23,040 yuan. This invention enables the four workers at the square furnace to earn 23,040 yuan per day, not only making money, but also putting the scrap iron to good use. (Yongsheng)

    原存山研究试验
    碎铁皮炼成光铁
    【本报陵川讯】陵川原庄原存山同志，参加太行二届群英大会后，积极领导群众生产。他想办法把打铁打下的碎铁皮（每斤不值十元），装到方炉的锅中，炼成光铁。开始试验时，在方炉上装了三锅碎铁皮（每锅八斤），方炉工人说：“不行，瞎干哩！”存山说：“试试看。”炼了一夜，一早出炉一看，三锅的碎铁皮，都炼成光铁，能出七成货，工人很高兴。方炉每火能装千斤碎铁皮，合洋万元；用黄矸土五百斤，合洋四百元；用炭一千五百斤，合洋一千五百元；用煤一百斤，合洋六十元；共用洋一一九六○元。
    每火出光铁七百斤，按五十元一斤计，合洋三万五千元，除开支净赚洋二三○四○元。这一发明使方炉四个工人，每天能赚洋二三○四○元，不但能赚钱，碎铁皮也有了用处。（永升）
